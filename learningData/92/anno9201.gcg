#note Round 31 of the 2011 Dallas Nationals. The winner of this game finishes 2nd in d2, the loser finishes 3rd. 2nd place was announced as $1500, 3rd is $750- a $750 game. (Later, they would reduce the prize for 2nd to $1000, though these changes were not made public that I know of until I received my check. Hmph. 

Anyway, back to Scrabble. I prefer AV to LV, why I chose BEZIL to BAIZE. VIABLE and BEZIL and BAIZE all sim very close to each other.

>Matt_Canik: AEKNOTV 7E O.K +25 63
#note He said this blocked his FA(G)GOTRY. Phew!
>Daniel_Citron: FOY 9B FOY +17 47
>Matt_Canik: AELNTVX 10A VANE +26 89
#note I want to hold the X for more points. This board looks like it's about to die, so I should hold onto any method for getting points I can. Quackle favors VEX 10A by about 3%. 
>Daniel_Citron: CT B9 ..CT +9 56
>Matt_Canik: AEHILTX A12 AXIL +39 128
#note I'm pretty glad I held on to it now.

>Matt_Canik: EIISTTU C12 TUI +9 177
#note I liked this play. Quackle does too. 
>Daniel_Citron: NU D14 NU +5 149
#note I forgot what exactly he said he had, but it justified this play entirely in my mind when he told me. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EIOSST I2 pOSTIES +75 252
#note Not much overlaps the P in front (O and U), and not as much bingoes with the P as a C in COSIEST. I feel this is a fairly defensive bingo. And apparently it was the right one, because....
>Daniel_Citron: CDEORRS -  +0 149
#note He challenges. 
>Matt_Canik: DFHIIOT H1 FOH +33 285
#note First priority is to shut down this board, I'll leave double Is to do it. 
>Daniel_Citron: CDEORRS 13G ORDER +34 183
#note I'm 99% sure he told me he had RECORDS as his rack. He said I blocked RECORDS/BEZILS and that's why he challenged. I guess he didn't see C(O)RRODES, which is now blocked. 
>Matt_Canik: DIIPRTV G3 TIP +13 298
#note He's gonna have a real tough time bingoing now, unless it's like from the U at 15D. 
>Daniel_Citron: ER 13G .....ER +19 202
>Matt_Canik: AADIRRV 15D .RARI +15 313
#note Kill another lane, but orderers is still worrisome. 
>Daniel_Citron: ABINOSW 5I .WIN +14 216
>Matt_Canik: ABDELMV M1 BLAMED +30 343
#note Kill the board more. 
>Daniel_Citron: OW 1M .OW +24 240
>Matt_Canik: ADISV N10 VIDS +25 368
#note I'm missing this rack, but I know I had an A. 
>Daniel_Citron: EOR N4 ORE +23 263
>Matt_Canik: AILNOTU 4K LI.. +18 386
#note The only lane left is through the I in twiner. And now it's gone. 
>Daniel_Citron: ACEGJNS J10 C... +13 276
>Matt_Canik: AEENOTU K1 OUT..NE +7 393
#note With JQ on his rack, I dont have to worry about sticking him, as long as I can go out in 2. And really, honestly, spread does not matter one bit. Winner is 2nd, loser is 3rd, no doubt. 
>Daniel_Citron: AEGJNQS 11M Q.S +12 288
#note J(I)N(S)/FOHN is cool. 
>Matt_Canik: AE O1 .AE +6 399
#note I think this was a solid performance on my side, another classic 'take an early lead and kill the board' game.
