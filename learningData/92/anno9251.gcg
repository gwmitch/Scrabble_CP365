>Matt: IIIISUU -IIIUU +0 0
#note Kept an I, maybe should have just pitched it as well.
>Nancy: ?DEERRT 8C RETiRED +66 66
>Matt: EEFIOST 7H FOE +16 16
>Nancy: ?ADEGLN K5 mANGLED +89 155
>Nancy: ?ADEGLN --  -89 66
#note She confused FOEN# with FOHN/FOEHN.  
>Matt: EIJLSTT F7 J.LTIEST +68 84
#note Confused this phony with JOLTIEST.  JILT E5 blocks all 2x2 possibilities.
>Nancy: ?ADEGLN 9H DEALiNG +72 138
#note There are 4 2x2's avaliable; I was lucky she couldn't find them.  Scored as 71.
>Matt: IIILOVW 13C IWI. +14 98
#note This or 10J WO; I like the option to try to play through this, rather than guaranteeing an exchange next turn.
>Nancy: GZ 11E Z.G +26 164
>Matt: AEILOPV 12A VELA +34 132
#note Saw PEAL, but not PIAL in the same spot.  If the R is more open that EOV leave looks a bit better.   C3 PAVIOR is also an interesting option that clears the junk.
>Nancy: ARUW 6J WAUR +28 192
>Matt: AHIIOOP M3 POO.I +16 148
#note This actually stays close with the Row 5 and 10 H bombs in win %.  I think I was so sick of looking at awful racks that rack management became priority number one, so I could bingo and get back in the game.  18 points (AHI, POOH) is a lot to give up though.
>Nancy: DDEU 14A DUDE +22 214
>Matt: ABHINOU 15A OH +29 177
#note Not good...AHI is still there and balances better.  Both C's are still out, so HUB L2 is out.  
>Nancy: Q L8 Q. +20 234
>Matt: AABEINU 10I ABA +28 205
#note Either this or something like GUINEA.  I figure I'm "due" some consonants and go for the points
>Nancy: FNU L2 FUN +20 254
>Matt: EEIKNUY 11K YEUK +34 239
#note I'm lucky this spot stays open, and I feel like I'm back in the game now.
>Nancy: AEINRST O3 RETAINS +83 337
#note Ouch.  I held for awhile to convince myself on the validity of DEALINGS.  
>Matt: CEINNOT 4L ..N. +4 243
#note This actually doesn't do that badly in the sim.  I was looking for something down column D or E for next turn.  CON 5I for 20 might have helped, but I wanted to keep as many bingo lanes open.
>Nancy: GOY 5I GOY +30 367
#note Amazing that spot stayed open for that long. 
>Matt: CEHINOT C1 NOTCHIE. +78 321
#note This is another phony, but at least this is Collins.  I was desperate to get back in the game, and didn't feel like I could afford another fish.
>Nancy: OX B5 OX +55 422
#note Of course she has the X...this is just not my game.
>Matt: AAIIMOS N11 .OI +7 328
#note so very close to INSOMNIA...again I felt I needed to open another line, to set up my S, and hope for a miracle draw.
>Nancy: AELV 1A VE.AL +27 449
#note Expected.
>Matt: AACIMSS 14H CAMISAS +100 428
#note Ironically this was the bingo I was least sure about being good, of course it's the one actually in TWL.  Quackle suggests fishing an A off wins ~5%; as there are 4 tiles in the unseen pool that bingo with ACIMSS (CAMISES, RACISMS, MISACTS/MISCAST/MASTICS).  I think that assumes she doesn't play to obstruct row 14, which she most certainly will. (something like BRIM/PRIM/BRIT etc.)
>Nancy: BMNPRRT 13M M.B +22 471
#note She held for a while, then released the play when she realized the only way to lose was to challenged the word and have it be good.  
>Matt: EI H13 I.E +15 443
#note Final score recorded as 470-457.  
>Matt:  (PRNTR) +14 457
