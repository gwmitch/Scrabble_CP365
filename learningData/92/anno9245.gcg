>Danny_Panganiban: EEIPRST 8D PESTIER +74 74
>Matthew_Larocque: AHNOOPR 7I HARPOON +78 78
#note Didn't see this right away - was pretty close to playing PHONO 7H instead. Would have really beat myself up for that one...
>Danny_Panganiban: NOU O7 .OUN +12 86
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGINQU N2 QUANG. +40 118
#note I thought this was a no-brainer when I saw it. It's a pretty tight race once I start the simulation though - the simple QUA 7C setting up my other A seems to take the top spot. This probably has something to do with the ING leave but I'd still rather score 40 and turn more tiles.
>Danny_Panganiban: FOT 9G OFT +23 109
>Matthew_Larocque: GHIIIIN O1 HI +26 144
#note I can exchange next turn when I REALLY don't have anything and the Q spot is eliminated.
>Danny_Panganiban: ABEOV 10C ABOVE +21 130
>Matthew_Larocque: AADGIII 5J AIDI.G +16 160
#note Quackle agrees - dumps a lot of crap and keeps me on the scoreboard.
>Danny_Panganiban: AEX 4J AXE +37 167
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNTU F1 ALUNITE. +62 222
#note I completely missed (TOE)A for this entire game. I saw the spot - but only D and S came to mind. The fact that it's a completely unrelated word must make it harder to see or something?
>Danny_Panganiban: ENV 1E V.NE +21 188
#note This was scored as 18. Honestly. I normally will correct my opponents errors, but when it's a money game and the errors are as careless as this - then that's just too bad for you!
>Matthew_Larocque: CCEITTU D8 .U.IC +22 244
#note I missed TU(N)IC for 24, C(A)CTI for 24, and CUTIE 11A. I didn't know (P)ECTIC for 26. I kinda like (P)ECTIC for points and blocking the easy S-hook. I was feeling a Danny bingo coming because whenever I forgo blocking an easy lane he almost always throws down a bingo there.
>Danny_Panganiban: BENOORT 5A BORON.TE +70 258
#note Phony - I did hold for a long time. I mean, I know BORNITE is fine, but this didn't ring a bell at all. Unfortunately, the only bingos I saw were (B)EnEDICT and (P)rECITED. And I thought the latter was a phony. I wasn't even sure on the former either. I decided to let it go since (B)EnEDICT scored a lot and I was leaning towards it being valid.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CDEEIT A5 .EnEDICT +89 333
#note Yes, I didn't see (B)IsECTED even though I played TRISECTED in facebook scrabble not too long ago. Even though this isn't far behind - challenging the phony and playing one of the P bingos is the only right option here.
>Danny_Panganiban: KW D4 W.K +20 278
>Matthew_Larocque: EELLORS B4 L.REL +14 347
#note Phony, and not even a good play at that. The problem is I thought (P)OLLER was a phony, and I didn't see anything else at all. 11C L(I)E for example - keeps the rack strong and still scores 12. I was thinking about ROLLS 11K just to block the most obvious place to bingo. And because it's Danny, I know he's going to get an easy bingo to gip me once more.
>Danny_Panganiban: ADEGRRS 11I GRADERS +73 351
#note He scored this as 77, I was too low on time to double-check his plays by this point. This became a really weird game because of the various math errors - more on this later.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIMOSW J10 F.OW +18 365
#note Now I'm in trouble because I can't make a good overlap here. Even though this wins the sim, blocking his bingo was what should have been done last turn so I wasn't in the mess I'm in now.
>Danny_Panganiban: IJLST 14F JILTS +43 394
#note Scored as only 40 - meaning Danny still has 2 points less than his actual score.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIMMS H12 MA.M +33 398
#note I didn't waste much time here, because I didn't have any time left. I saw I(D)EAS to go out next turn - but I was pretty sure that was getting blocked and I'd be under huge pressure to find something else. Sim has MIMES 2H winning but that seems impossible if he plays something like (D)oZY.
>Danny_Panganiban: ?DYYZ M10 Z.Ds +26 420
#note He doesn't see/know DoZY though, his best play by far.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIS N10 I.E +22 420
#note Can't go out now - this is best.
>Danny_Panganiban: YY K11 .Y +10 430
#note He didn't know (FROWS)Y either, to my benefit.
>Matthew_Larocque: AS N2 ......S +19 439
#note I totally failed by playing this. I knew he had the other Y, but because I was down to like 45 seconds and was panicking, I thought I was only going to get 4 points from his Y instead of the doubled 8. I couldn't scan the whole board for all the places to play off AS. I simply saw AS B12 and thought I would cause a tie of 428-428. I dump my S for 19 thinking it would be enough to outscore him....
>Danny_Panganiban: Y H4 Y. +9 439
#note Then he himself fails by missing the 10 point spot for his Y (as well as (FROWS)Y). He plays for 9 points. After all the wrongly scored plays, it lines this game up as a tie, 439-439. If the tie stands, I get 3rd place (money) and Danny gets 5th. If Danny wins, he gets 3rd and I get 4th. Danny would win in a recount by 2 points. He has nothing to lose and everything to gain - well except maybe a few rating points. Really shocked that he didn't want to recount. 
>Danny_Panganiban:  (A) +2 441
#note Also noteworthy - Danny had 2 tie games in a 6 round tournament - ridiculous!
