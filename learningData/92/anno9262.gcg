#note hard rack. vibe 10b made too much score possible in C. quackle puts a lot of things in front of this, but i don't hate it. it has some turnover, doesn't give too much back.

#note there are two bingos that he could have through the V (reinvoke and overkeen), but i didn't see them. ovoli was the proper blocking play. i played this to try to be closer to able to go out next turn. it also sets up a good scoring spot for the the K in case i draw it. if he has it, he still won't be able to score enough to outrun me if he plays it in 13.
