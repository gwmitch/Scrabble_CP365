#note i know i'm supposed to play TOE here, but i didn't want to give him easy points on the dls . against an expert player i'd probably just play toe. i dunno. i get punished for it, of course.

#note after trade and his previous play, i didn't want to make it easy to play in row 15.  worse leave and a few less points to play here, but it seemed reasonable.

#note so he played his S, and so i hoped this might be okay. plus i'm at double his score after i do it. still scary.

#note aaaah. i should've traded. i was thinking worst case scenario is he's drawn XSS, and so i take out the X spot, which is the only thing i can really block on this play. RALPH is quackle's play. i considered PERV, but didn't think about RALPH. it does a nice job of turning over tiles.

#note before he plays this, i overdraw and he turns over the other ess and throws it back. argh. thank goodness for this free turn. i probably would've lost otherwise.
>k8: ELLRTVW N13 LEV +18 391
#note quackle still wants be to exchange. beyond that, though, this is best. reduces the damage a bit. i just didn't want to reach in the bag and draw something like nnngt and lose the chance to let him play for a million a second time without scoring.

#note quackle kind of hates this. it wins 83% of the time, where TAW 7A wins 92%. i was focused on blocking bingo possibilities. as it turns out, there are no possible bingos through the S or N, which I was not going to figure out in my head (because i'm lazy - not because it's impossible). i figured i'd just play long and get out quick.
