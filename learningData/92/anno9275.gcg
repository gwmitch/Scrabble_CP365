>Deen: AIP 8G PIA +10 10
>Jeremy: AGILRTW 9I WIG +20 20
#note 3 points better is J6 WILT.  I wouldn't have guessed.
>Deen: ?AEISSU L3 SAUrIES +72 82
>Jeremy: AALRTUZ J9 .ZAR +33 53
#note Duck has 6I TZA(r) on valuation, but I picked the wpct play.  I like keeping it more open if I'm losing.
>Deen: JO 7I JO +38 120
>Jeremy: AELLRTU K9 .AL +23 76
#note duck likes it
>Deen: AQT 3I QAT. +23 143
>Jeremy: ELLRRTU 12H LU.ER +17 93
#note 2.7 points ahead is L11 TRULL.
>Deen: EFHIMOS 2J FE +28 171
>Jeremy: AHLRRRT 5K H.RL +14 107
#note 4.3 points ahead is 5J THURL.  I pondered it, but convinced myself just THIRL was good.
>Deen: ELOPS O5 SLOPE +29 200
>Jeremy: AORRRTU H12 .OUR +12 119
#note 6 points ahead is N1 TORULA.  I don't see how that is going to win.  I prefer to open up real estate so I have a chance at a big score.
>Deen: EH 6J HE. +31 231
>Jeremy: AABCRRT 1K BRACT +35 154
#note Changed my play from BARCA to BRACT when I looked at the tile pool.  Quackle did the same thing.
>Deen: DTY 14G D.TY +16 247
>Jeremy: ABKNORW N7 BOW +21 175
#note 11.7 points better is N7 WONK. Or BONK or WORK. Blew the game on this play I think.  Not sure how I missed that.
>Deen: DDEEINO 13L END +10 257
>Jeremy: AEIKNNR 4G AKIN +30 205
#note AKIN gives me a good shot to bingo.  Much better than just KIKN
>Deen: DFI 5E FID +17 274
>Jeremy: AAEGNOR 15J ORANGE +29 234
#note Was going to play ANGORA, but it's the last A.  Plenty of E's to go.  Duck says 1.2 points better is fishing with H4 KOA.
>Deen: IN 14N IN +16 290
>Jeremy: ADGNOOX N1 .OXA. +28 262
#note 6.1 ahead of my play is 6B GONAD.  I considered it.  I really should have just played N1 COX, and kept that last A.
>Deen: ?EEEMNS 9A dEMESNE +67 357
#note Although there are several others, I think this is a nice find.  That's SEEDMEN to me.
>Jeremy: CDGIINO 3A GONIDIC +87 349
#note missed E7 DISCOING.  Thank goodness.  I thought GONIDIC was phony.  Maybe 20% chance it was good.  Still it looked like my only hope of winning.  Left myself with 31 seconds and played this.
>Deen: EIMOTTV -  +0 357
#note Deen challenges!  I'm surprised it is good.
>Jeremy: ETUVY A1 VU. +21 370
#note Nothing wins the game unfortunately.  C7 VUM is 6 points better though.  I take about 18 seconds and plunk down VUG.
>Deen: EIMOTTV B9 .MOTIVE +36 393
#note B2 MOTIVE is 10 more points, and nets 14 more spread, but this'll do.
>Jeremy: ETY 6D YET +17 387
#note NO!  I miss my winning play.  4B YET.
>Jeremy:  (T) +2 389
