#note I wonder what percentage of the time VROUW, when playable, is the top play. I suspect you can almost make the rule "if you can play VROUW, you should play VROUW."

#note Surprised this simmed best (2000 iteration 4-ply), but it did. I probably would have gone with RITARDS if I'd thought of it, but it's not like I'm taking some big lead with this bingo, so that might have been more defensive than necessary.

>Geoff: AEEEIOS -AEEIO +0 235
#note Quack likes EAS(Y) for 33, or keeping AS instead of ES given the pool. Keep AES fine too. Played this one a bit too rote.

#note Best bingo available, though those two huge X spots sure jump out at you.

#note I don't care what you say, Quackle, I'm not playing BROO at D1 here.
>Ross: ADEI D1 IDEA +21 336
>Geoff: FILOQTT 1C Q. +11 401
#note About 4 minutes left on my clock at this point. J13 OFT wins 100% of the time and QI only 94%. GEEKIEST down low, yeah, that would barely win. I had enough time to see that he had nothing through the I, but the spot was an attractive Q-dump and I couldn't convince myself I wasn't missing something he could have there. Glad it didn't cost me.
