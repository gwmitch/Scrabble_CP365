#note ALOO(F) is probably better cause it's less volatile and leaves a consonant.

#note This is where seeing how your opponent's move effects the board comes into play.  You can't have your play ready to go before they play.  Had the same play on the triple line, but didn't even consider it.  ugh.

#note my brain broke after about 5 minutes of trying to figure out the right play.   Just messed up the placement.  Helluva time to do something like this.  I welcome any input on this play.  Playing way too sloppy at this point in the day.
