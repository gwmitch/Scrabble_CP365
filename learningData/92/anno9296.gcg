#note Quackle wants me to play JIG at 8H instead. Against a human, I don't think so.

>Geoff: CEEEMQS 14J EME +20 329
#note Gah, didn't see EMCEE. With Trey's last play, I've got to play down here, but this was a sizable error.

>Geoff: CEQSUVX N12 V.C +16 345
#note Wanted to block L15-O15 plays and clear out tiles clogging up the rack...also sets up my S for a play down there if needed. With two more U's out, I did think about TUX O13, but that leave was really unappealing. VAC barely edges out TUX in the sim (on win pct. - VAC is 3-4 better on equity.)
>Trey: AEILLRS 5B RALLIES +66 300
>Geoff: EQSTUUX C3 QU.TE +30 375
#note Fun position here, certainly not sure I got it right. You see what I'm doing - if he plays E/QUATE, I have a good chance of replying with XIS/EQUATES for 50 (XIS/GODSENDS also available). Considered C3 QUA as well. Problem with either play is that it increases the value of a bingo if he does happen to hit the 2 row. Quackle likes K10 US for reasons I utterly can't fathom. QUATE sims about a point worse and 1.5% of win pct., along with some other plays. Input most welcome here.
>Trey: OWW B7 WOW +14 314
>Geoff: IMSUVXY F4 M.X +28 403
#note D2 XI was the play, though MIX was a very close second (95% vs 94%). XI would have blocked Trey's bingo the next turn, though he could still play it at L5. I was getting pretty low on time and maybe a little nervous at the thought I might actually lose this game somehow after thinking it was surely in the bag earlier.

>Geoff: BIISUVY K9 VIS +32 435
#note Er...BUSY for 53? BYS for 36? I was so relieved to get the win I just threw down the first thing I saw. Oh well, at least it was only spread.

#note Oh my god, what a weird game.
