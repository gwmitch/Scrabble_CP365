>Jim_Burlant: AAHIILY 8G ALIYAH +32 32
#note And after nearly 2 minutes, I find the best play.
>Trey_Wright: GHLU K7 L.UGH +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: DGIIOVZ 9E VIG +14 46
#note Sim prefers 9G GID 21 by roughly 2 points.  Both that choice and this one set up the Z; at the time I was happy with this, but in retrospect I may have left a little too much on the scoreboard just to unload a V.
>Trey_Wright: ADEOTU 7B AUTOED +17 35
>Jim_Burlant: DEIJOSZ B6 Z. +31 77
#note Q prefers 6E JO and E4DOJO by a bit.  I felt that, especially since I had left so many points on the board on the previous turn, I couldn't/shouldn't do that again.  This choice is the bronze medalist.
>Trey_Wright: EIOR E9 .IREO +16 51
>Jim_Burlant: DEIJOSV 12B JIV. +28 105
#note Sikm say sthis play wins 1/2% more often than JIVED and sims 1 point higher.  JIVED scores 32 but the more balanced leave made this my choice, and I reaped huge dividends on the next turn.
>Trey_Wright: EU B12 .EU +20 71
>Jim_Burlant: DEOORRS D1 REDROO.S +72 177
#note The only bingo.
>Trey_Wright: AORWY 1C A.ROWY +36 107
#note Or 1A YARROW.   Not that I'm surprised that he played there, but his taking away my impending play of C(R)OWNET for 36 ultimately changed the game in his favor.
>Jim_Burlant: CENOTTW 2B TW.EN +31 208
#note Best.  2F  WOE scores 37 but the CNTT leave could be really problematic depending on his next move.  I'm winning 89% right now, but that's about to change.
>Trey_Wright: ?CEEINR 5D .vERNICE +86 193
#note Best bingo for Trey and he's now back in the game
>Jim_Burlant: ACGOPST 8A OPT. +34 242
#note Remember my comment a couple of turns back about not being able to play CROWNET?  TWEEN was the right play...but I didn't know that it took an A front hook.  Q prefers a bunch of A1 plays - PACT, CAPO, and GAP, with this choice simming in 5th place, roughly 6-1/2 points down on PACT.  Had I known the hook, GAP probably would have been my chioce, as I would have wanted to unload the G while preserving my S so I could hopefully bingo in either the M column or on row 12.
>Trey_Wright: ABIKQRS M6 QIS +26 219
#note Post-mortem, Trey told me this was his rack.  He saw BARK A1 (the clear best choice) but he was absolutely convinced I was about to hit him down the M column and he wanted to address that first.  This is where my not knowing the hook to TWEEN absolutely  killed me, as you're about to see.
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEGMS 4K BAG +16 258
#note Not knowing the front hook to TWEEN, QIS blocked my intended play of GAMBES M3 and left me in a bad position.  If you know your words, the play is obvoiusly A1 GAMB or GAMBE if you don't mind burning the E.  If you don't know the hook, your options are limited.  This is weak.
>Trey_Wright: ABEKMPR A1 BARK +54 273
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEMSU L11 EMU +15 273
#note Reasonable play given that it sets up the S hook his Q play blocked, but it gives up a little too much on the scoreboard to 3C ADEEM 40.  Given his next rack, though, it may not have mattered.
>Trey_Wright: ?AEEITT H8 .ATErITE +79 352
#note Best bingo, and he just blocked my bingo, so what to do now?
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEINS N6 ID +21 294
#note Trey's comment as this came down:  "A *fantastic* play, and I can't do anything about it." Thanks for the compliments Trey.  This is a very strong play , but it's not best.  Not long thereafter I wondered if I should have just played the I and not the D, and Quackle shows I was right to have questioned my choice.  While I was seduced by the extra 8 points, the better play was QI for 13.    Problem with ID is I now have to start my bingo with an S instead of having a free run at the O column with a wide-open S hook.  


>Trey_Wright: ANOX 15A AXON +54 406
>Jim_Burlant: ACDELNS 15F CL.ANSED +62 356
#note At least I get to save face.  Q says that, apparently, the best play is to not bingo and just play CANID 10B for 25.  That wins 8%; this wins 0.6%.  I think that anything at this point is just window dressing on the spread.  End game is played out from here with nothing remarkable happening.  Final score 382 - 465.   Nothing to hang my head about.  Can't/won't beat myself over the fact that I didn't know the front hook to TWEEN, and that's really what decided this game.  This was probably as solid of a game as I was capable of playing.  The better player won.
