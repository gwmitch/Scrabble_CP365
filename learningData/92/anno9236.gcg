>Jim_Burlant: AIJLTTV 8D VITAL +24 24
#note Interesting opening rack.  I dickered over whether to put this down and risk vowel placement with VITAL or put down VITTA instead. I opted to go with VITAL because I preferred JT to JL.  The top 4 choices - of which this is one-  sim within 2-1/2 points of each other.  Sim winner is 8D VITTA, ahd 8G and 8F JILT are second and third.
>Darrell_Day: EHW 7G HEW +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: ABDHJOT 6F JABOT +48 72
#note Best.  JAB and JATO give up too many scoreboard points for a rather non-bingo-prone leave.  Play incorrectly scored as 49.
>Darrell_Day: ABEEOSX F8 .EABOXES +71 99
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEHLTU 15F .HUTtLED +86 158
#note Best bingo but it's really just style preference - SLEUTHED or SHUtTLED are just as good.
>Darrell_Day: CKOY 12D CO.KY +36 135
>Jim_Burlant: EEMNNTU 5I MENU +22 180
#note Best. Other plays worth consideration:  5I NEUM, 11H MENU, 5I NUMEN.
>Darrell_Day: AMN 4J NAM +23 158
>Jim_Burlant: AEENNST 3K NE +10 190
#note Missing J8 SETENANT 61, which I didn't know.  This is one of the three best non-bingo options.  And this turned out to be a good miss, as you'll see shortly.
>Darrell_Day: FIZ 14L FIZ +38 196
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGNST M1 iNGESTA +87 277
#note And after several minutes, I find it.  None of the other options scores more than 69.  To this point, I've drawn extremely well and the tile gods are handing me the game on a silver platter.  This game was about to become very tough.
>Darrell_Day: DFN 1L F.ND +33 229
>Jim_Burlant: AIIINRR O1 .INAR +7 284
#note Terrible, terrible play by me.  Blind to the board - IXIA 13E scores 26.  I was too focused on trying to turn as many tiles as I could to work my way out of this garbage. Though this does prevent him from bingoing down the O column, this gives up WAY too many points on the scoreboard.  I(X)IA was the play.
>Darrell_Day: AGLOR 11H ALGOR +17 246
>Jim_Burlant: IIIPRRR J11 .RIP. +13 297
#note  Best play is apparently IRID 12M, but not by much.  I wanted to turn as much of this dreck as I could, and IRID did open up a line for a 7.   I'm still winning 70%.
>Darrell_Day: IT G12 .IT. +24 270
>Jim_Burlant: IIOORRY L8 YIR. +11 308
#note Not sure if I wrote this correctly; can't tell if it was IIOORRY or IIOQRRY.  Can't believe I'd have missed the 21-point Q dump if the Q were in my rack, so I'll assume it was an O.  At any rate this is awfull! L9 YIRR is right - this gives back WAY too much if he's got an S.  Obviously wasn't paying attention to what I was doing when I put this down.
>Darrell_Day: DSTU 12L STUD +30 300
>Jim_Burlant: EEIOOQR N11 Q.I. +22 330
#note Missing OROIDE, blinded by the Q.  With the q friendliness of this board, OROIDE was definitely the play and the Q should have waited.
>Darrell_Day: PRW 10E W.RP +17 317
>Jim_Burlant: EEEOORV N7 EVE +8 338
#note Yes, the rack is dreadful.  Unfortunately, courtesy of my mistakes, if Darrell can hit a 5 ending in ID, he probably wins this game.  I have to block this at all costs and cannot take the turn out to exchange.  Championship player agrees - this is best.
>Darrell_Day: DO O9 DO +6 323
#note Smart play by Darrell - I was going to play RAID.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIOOR K7 COO +12 350
#note This is one of the best choices  and Championship Player says this or COVE D6 are the two best plays.
>Darrell_Day: GO D12 .OG +6 329
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIR D5 REA.E +8 358
#note Saw the out in two and was happy that this clinched.  Apparently the best play is AIGRET 14B.  Getting low on time, I didn't feel it worth while to spend another couple of minutes possibly going over to save a handful more spread ponts.  Best case, I milk 10 more points if I play AIGRET.
>Darrell_Day: EILSU 15A LIES +23 352
>Jim_Burlant: AI C9 AI +6 364
