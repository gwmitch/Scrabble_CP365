#note well, i don't know! i don't know any damn words! i was pretty sure oviform was good, so maybe he's baiting me, or is just having collins confusion, all that i know is that i GOT DOUBLE BLANKED AGAIN. i don't quite know how to calculate my equity loss for this. i would not have been able to block all his bingoes, but i would have gotten an extra turn. his equity loss for passing here is (-29.5), does that make sense for me?
