#note OUD again, apparently, by a tiny bit. this is a tough decision.

>cesar: EILMRTV 3G VIM +22 251
#note VIM is a poor move, because i'm blocking up a lane, right? also, MITER is a better leave; L12 VELD sims best. (-4)

>cesar: AALRRTT 14M RA. +13 283
#note there's a few moves that quackle likes best like 2H LAR or TAR. i'm kind of at a loss for what to do and will need nothing short of a miracle. it doesn't seem right though, to play 3 tiles and empty the bag; i'm almost guaranteeing the loss unless i draw a bingo in two spots! (-14.5%)
>marylin_w: INQU N8 QUIN +17 329
#note !!!!!!!!!!!!
>cesar: ?AFLRTT O6 FRiT +50 333
#note why does quackle think that B9 LA is going to win? wtf?? bug in the endgame solver. L12 FE though seems to win by 5 more. (-5) marylin didn't realize the other blank was out till she hit the clock.

#note huge sigh of relief. i was about to be 5-9....... 6-10 certainly sounds a lot better.
