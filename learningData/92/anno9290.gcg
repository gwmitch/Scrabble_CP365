#note KIT B10 wins the most often. My play, which I agonized over for all my remaining time, has the highest valuation. The way I saw it, I couldn't outrun ZA B10 or a big Z play hooking on to KA 10B, so I couldn't allow either. My play also keeps TUGRIK 14A for next turn, although I recognized that I had to watch for ZETA A12.

#note Crap.

#note A very appropriate word, seeing as I have a winning move. If I hadn't run out of time, I like to think I would have seen it. I did see SITZMARK, BRITZKA, BRITZSKA, and ZIKURAT, but none of those words matter.

#note Still an opportunity for TELEOSTEAN, if anyone wants it. Anyone?
