#note Or DOXY for 39; the sim says either play is just as strong as the other.  In most games, this wouldn't really matter; had I known just how much trouble I would have landing an E this game, I might have thought twice and played for 39 with DOXY.  
>Paul_Hagelstein: EELNRSU 9B UNREELS +61 71
#note Plays at G3 for 70.
>Jim_Burlant: AADEOTY J6 YA. +37 78
#note Strong choice but not best - YOGA only scores one more point but turns the extra tile and unloads the O.  I didn't see it.  This is runner-up, nearly 7 points down.  Nothing else worth considering according to the sim.
>Paul_Hagelstein: DEEIO D8 O.EIDE +16 87
>Jim_Burlant: AADEORT C12 ADO +17 95
#note This choice is tops statically, and it sims very well, finishing 0.4 pionts down on ODA in the same place.  One thing to keep in mind is that Paul is an established 1300-level player, and I was predicating a lot of my choices on how I expected him to play.  In this instance I was expecting him to do whatever he could to shut down the S hook at the triple.  He did that, but not quite how I expected.

>Jim_Burlant: AEJRTTV 4I JA.E +24 119
#note Not sure what I was thinking; safe to say I was startled by his having hit a bingo off his 5-tile vowel dump.  And you'll notice that, of the 8 E's that have been played,  he's already drawn 6 of them, and I have no choice but to burn my E if I want to make a play here.  Best is F8 JET apparently; I rejected that, as I wanted to leave that open for bingos.  I probably should have played L3 JET...just wasn't sure what I was thinking here.  This chioce is horrible, but given my next draw it wouldn't have mattered.

>Jim_Burlant: IMRTTVZ L1 RIV.T +11 130
#note Again, I'm assuming/expecting Paul to cool off and resort to 1300-level play, possibly burning his bingo tiles just to make sure the triple closes down.  I put this down expecting him to come back for maybe 18 or 21, or 36 worst case but that his reply would still keep things open.  I sure wasn't expecting his next play.  For what it's worth - sim likes VUM B8.  I passed on F column plays because, again, I wanted to keep that line open.
>Paul_Hagelstein: EHINSTW 2H WHIN.EST +82 286
#note Gee, that could have been worse - he could have hit the 3x3.  <<groan>>
>Jim_Burlant: IMNORTZ 1G MO +27 157
#note Now I'm shaken up and missing some good plays, though they're admittedly hard to find.  NERTZ E8 scores 49.  1D INTRO/NITRO score 33, and the advantage of those plays is that they turn tiles to get to the blanks.  I'm okay with this - given my deficit, nothing wrong with playing short and lengthening the game, and if I don't score 27 there he might score 50 the way this game's been going.
>Paul_Hagelstein: BIL F6 BIL. +12 298
>Jim_Burlant: AINRTVZ 11D .ZAR +26 183
#note G12 plays are slightly better - TZAR, but apparently E3 VITA is best.  Whatever - best play wins 1%, this wins 0.4.
>Paul_Hagelstein: AI 1N AI +14 312
>Jim_Burlant: ILNRTUV B8 L.V +14 197
#note Gee, where was this rack when the E in UNREELS was still open?  This play does very well statically and is as good as anything else int he sim.  Other options are 13I UNLIT, 7E VIRL, 3E VIRL, G3 UNLIT, and 13I UNTIL.
>Paul_Hagelstein: AF A7 FA +21 333
>Jim_Burlant: IKNPRTU -KUP +0 197
#note Another rack that comes two turns too late - TURNPIKE would have at least been a fun play in a losing effort.  Q says I don't need to exchange, but really - does it matter at this point?
>Paul_Hagelstein: LP 7E L.P +8 341
>Jim_Burlant: EGINORT 12F GENITOR +73 270
#note Alive...just barely.  Up from 0.05% winning chances to 2-1/2%.  Now if he somehow misses the blanks and I draw a blank bingo out of the bag...
>Paul_Hagelstein: ??NORSW M6 WONdeRS +68 409
#note Sigh...
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIPQU 3C CAIQUE +42 312
#note Was tempted to try CAPIQUE* as a spread saving measure but decided against it.

#note No argument that I made some risky choices, but luck clearly was not on my side in this one.  Not a whole lot I could do about this and I'm sure I lose this one big no matter how I play it.
