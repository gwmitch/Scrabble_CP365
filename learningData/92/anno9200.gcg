>Matt_Canik: DEFFMNO 8H OFFED +28 28
#note Well that's disappointing. OFFEND 8C.
>Richard_Spence: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 0
>Matt_Canik: ABIKMNT H3 AKIMB. +19 47
#note I'm trying to clean off the rack here, but I should have slowed down and spotted something like B(E)ATNIK for 26, or BATIK/BOFFED. AKIMBO may be a cool word, but is sims about 3.5% lower than the top plays.
>Richard_Spence: ?DINSWZ K1 DoWNSIZ. +90 90
#note This is why this kid won d2. Nice play, Richard. 
>Matt_Canik: LLLNRTW 6J W.LL +15 62
>Richard_Spence: IOV 1H VOI. +24 114
>Matt_Canik: CGLNORT G8 CLOG +23 85
#note Well I thought COFFED was good, he gave it an uneasy look but didn't even hold. 
>Richard_Spence: EO L3 OE +13 127
>Matt_Canik: ANPRSTU M2 UP +24 109
#note I recognized the alphagram too, but then couldn't unsee PATRONS/PATRONS/TARPONS. Wowwww. UNSTRAP. 
>Richard_Spence: ?AEINTU 11E TE.UmINA +82 209

>Richard_Spence: AEJ F9 AJ.E +54 263
>Matt_Canik: ANNRSTY H11 .NARY +27 187
#note This keeps things open. I decide against anything forming WILLY because it either shuts down the board or gives up a free TWS. This sims just slightly behind YARN/WILLY 34. 
>Richard_Spence: GHO 1M HOG +29 292
>Matt_Canik: EMNPSTT L10 T.MP +16 203
#note N(o)T(U)M 12L is 31. 
>Richard_Spence: AEIIR 14F AI.IER +10 302
#note He told me he holds the Q here hoping to hit it big the next turn. 
>Matt_Canik: EENRSST N4 RESENTS +71 274
>Richard_Spence: BY G2 BY +20 322
>Matt_Canik: AAEINOR M12 AI +16 290
#note Maybe if I can hit one more bingo I've got a shot at this thing. NAOI O7 scores so much that I guess I shouldn't have passed up on it. 
>Richard_Spence: EINQRU 15J REQUIN +79 401
>Matt_Canik: AEENORR 15D ORE +6 296
#note Threatens a bingo ending in D or S.
>Richard_Spence: CGLO C12 CLOG +19 420
#note Lol, clog is played twice.

>Matt_Canik: AADHRTU F1 HAAR +21 327
>Matt_Canik: AADHRTU --  -21 306
#note I've given up here, I'm playing quickly and upside-down. I know that in this situation in the tournament, spread doesn't matter. Still, it's a stupid play. g1 matt.

>Richard_Spence: EST 4D ST.E. +26 477
#note Really, I've lost track of the plays. I'll just quit the anno here, 343-488 final. I played pretty awful this one, he drew some nice stuff but I'm sure had I not been so boneheaded I could've at least given him a run for his money here.
