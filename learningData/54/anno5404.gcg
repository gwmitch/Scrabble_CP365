#note Thought I was mostly likely to be able to exploit this play. Plenty of other options, though. I took a while here.

#note Another product of a long think. AJEE E9 is an alternative.

>Sam: ACEOOPU B3 CAPO +17 268
#note This might be better for defense and turnover, but OAR B6 still has to be preferred I think.

#note Defending against big column A plays. UTE or USE E1 are also possibilities, though they open up a weak bingo line.
>Joel_Sherman: AAEFNRV 1A FR. +18 266
>Sam: AESSSTU 11E ....S +14 318
#note Quackle prefers UTS E1, but this closes off one of the last bingo lanes. Now to get to row 15...
>Joel_Sherman: AAENNRV 10I .AV +11 277
>Sam: AERSSTU L10 SAU +16 334
#note VAU or even VAUS may have been a better play here. It gives him an opportunity to bingo, but gives me a chance to bingo back. I was pretty locked into the "block everything" mindset at this point, though.
>Joel_Sherman: ANO K8 NO.A +18 295
>Sam: EGINRST 6F ...G +8 342
#note Missed a bingo here, CONSTRINGE. I think it's the better play even though it empties the bag on the number, as few bingoes by Joel can make up the deficit. However, Quackle seems to prefer MIGG from what I can tell. I wasn't finding that ten anyhow.
>Joel_Sherman: ?AFNOTU I4 FA. +7 302
>Sam: EINNRST 5I .NI +6 348
#note I was pretty low on time at this point and didn't have much time to ruminate. Champ Player suggests ANTI 5I which looks pretty good as I have a great shot to bingo back if he bingos off of it.
>Joel_Sherman: A 4I .A +7 309
>Sam: EEINRST L3 INSET +14 362
#note I must have made a mistake somewhere in the last several plays, because I went from so in control of the game to a 75% favorite after this play. Joel kept ADORTU? on his last play, and drew the A out of the bag instead of the E, so he lost a coin flip for the game. A shame to win like that when I probably should have handled the game differently.
