#note Quackle puts the winning percentage of this play way ahead of any other choice. Second is BUSTIC which I didn't know at all.

#note My play sims best, but I really like PUL 14D - better leave and forces him to empty the bag if he bingos.

>monkey: AELNRSW M2 WALES +36 481
#note I knew WALES would allow JOBS, but I figured I could go out and survive. Didn't have time to look at each letter though, and it turns out the only winning play is WARES. WALES loses to R in the bag, whereas keeping LN allows NEROL M11 and LINER E1! There are a couple other plays that lose to one letter in the bag - NEAT 3B and WALNUT E11.

>monkey: NOR 12B .ORN +8 489
#note I was pretty sure ON O1 was best but I was down to a few seconds and just went out. IRON or INRO 13B is a few more points.
