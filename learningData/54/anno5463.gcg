#note quite annoying to miss the clearly superior GEEZ. i'm not sure how to spot plays like that consistently. (-11.5) part of me just wanted a lot of volatility so once i saw heeze i stopped looking.
>Lisa: ?AEEEFS 5G F.EEbASE +70 208
#note another sick find.
>Cesar: BGNORST O1 BONGS +41 155
#note i couldn't find a good way to use the R hook. 4L BONG may be better because RST is significantly better than RT, especially in this situation. (-3)

>Cesar: AAEGRTU C12 .ATU +20 175
#note -5.5 to A7 TEGUA. i was actually about to play RAGU* there. i was playing sloppy because i was getting my ass kicked, and lisa was at like 23 minutes. i don't even think i tracked until later.

#note GRIPER is slightly winninger.

#note that basically seals it...

#note and that
>Cesar: DDNOSTY 11G ODD +25 281
#note M2 DONSY maybe.
>Lisa: AEUX A8 EAUX +46 421
>Cesar: BFNOSTY 8K N.FTY +33 314
#note A14 BY apparently gives me a 2.5% chance. Lisa's brain would probably have to stop working in order to get even 2.5%. i don't see what conceivable set of tiles would make me win this game, but ok.
