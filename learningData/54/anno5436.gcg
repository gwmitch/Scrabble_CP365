#note if i had just left it, i would have had MANGLE/LATHIEST for 66, and she would have burned a blank.  i thought about that front L hook as soon as i got up to go to the challenge computer and was really mad at myself.  i played LAX because i wanted to keep some high scoring tiles, and had a feeling she would just play a bingo out into the triple lane, and also expose the I for possible -INGs.

#note i don't think she'll see the hook potential here, and feel like i need to take the chance. this scores well and i don't hate the leave.

#note i have to lose the Q, and putting it in the triple lane, i see easy qaid, or qintar. i decide to take out the bingo line instead, which is turns out was a good idea as she did have a bingo there.
