>Jim_Burlant: ACDEIRV E6 CA.VED +24 24
#note Yuck.  Didn't see CARRIED, I was too fixated on dumping the V.  At the time I didn't think this was a bad play, but later events make me realize why Quackle pans this play so badly. (-8.1)
>Gigi_Miller: AEHRT F10 HEART +34 60
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIJRV 13B JIVE. +30 54
#note Best, at just under 41% winning chances.
>Gigi_Miller: AGUY 15F YUGA +36 96
>Jim_Burlant: AADGNRT B13 .AG +22 76
#note Didn't think of GANJA.    Was too busy fishing and didn't look to break this rack up.  2nd best, at a pretty hefty loss of valuation though. (-8.4)
>Gigi_Miller: IS G12 IS +22 118
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNRTT 14A T.D +7 83
#note Note:  her last play made it obvious she's sitting on another S, so this sim is being run against an inferred S.    The sim says I should dump this rack for all of 9 points with LATTIN at C9?  Be serious.  The the particular fish chosen is about personal preference - do I prefer ALNRT or ADNRT? 
>Gigi_Miller: ORSU 5E SOUR +34 152
>Jim_Burlant: AELNPRT 14I PLANTER +76 159
#note Hadn't considered the S hook to CARVED when I made my opening play, and with good reason - CARVED doesn't take a front S! It didn't even occur to me that her play was phony.  Joke's on me here!  No matter, my choice this turn sims best, at 36% winning chances.  BTW, good thing I kept the L when I fished last turn instead of the D, eh?
>Gigi_Miller: AEX 15M AXE +47 199
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: BEEIMNQ H1 EMBE. +30 189
#note Quackle prefers H1 BEMIRE (which I didn't see) for 33.   I know there are 5 I's in the pool but I'd still rather keep an I around as Q insurance.  Considered G3 EQUINE but felt it gave up too many points.  This choice comes in 3rd in the sim and takes a moderate equity hit. (-5.4)
>Gigi_Miller: ER 13M ER +20 219
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINQST 7H INQuEST +70 259
#note Didn't think of QuIET(E)NS on row 1.  Was a little worried about that unseen S but figured that for 70 points I had to take the risk.
>Gigi_Miller: FIST O5 FIST +37 256
>Jim_Burlant: HLNOOWZ L3 WHOL. +22 281
#note Didn't feel the time was right to pull the plug on the Z.  Quackle's first choice here was MOZO 2H 35.  
>Gigi_Miller: BEIUU J4 UBI.UE +19 275
>Jim_Burlant: MNOOOWZ M2 ZOOM +49 330
#note Don't know if she wasn't paying attention to the pool or if her last play meant that she was sitting on the case E and needed to unload the duplicate as well as clear the vowel overload in her rack.  At the point I made this play my tracking had only 2 A's showing in the unseen pool, not 3, which might have changed my thinking.  Nonehtless there are too many points here to not take them.
>Gigi_Miller: AKO N1 OAK +46 321
#note Scored as 44.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDLNOW F2 CAL. +12 342
#note Couldn't decide what to do here and felt it was time to go about shutting bingo lines down.  I had initially thought a rack dump of CLONED 1D would be good, but the unseen Y concerned me as I didn't want to trade 12 for 30+ if she had the Y.  
>Gigi_Miller: NNO 3C NON. +8 329
>Jim_Burlant: DINOOWY I9 WON +19 361
#note I felt that it might be a good idea to try and extend the game by not burning both my scorers on this turn, preferring to hit her with WON on this turn and perhaps something like OY I2 on the next one. I didn't consider O1 to be a priority at this point.  Quackle prefers plays at 4B (YOWor DOW)  which I think is stupid - with this pool she could easily hit any number of bingos and outdistance me that way.
>Gigi_Miller: ?AENPRT 8A PAN..... +42 371
#note My brilliant strategy backfired on me.  Had I played somewhere other than I9, she would have attempted PAsTERN/UBIQUEs*, which I would have had to desperation challenge...and the play would have come off the board...at which point I would have cruised home easily.  Instead she took a couple of minutes and found this...and absolutely beautiful play.
>Jim_Burlant: DGIILOY K9 DOGY +25 386
#note This was the 8th game of the day and it's safe to say we were both probably getting a little tired.  I didn't see 2B YOGIC and at this point felt that I had to unload as many of my scorers as possible, setting myself up to go out at B5 or A8.  
>Gigi_Miller: ?EIRT O1 Es +20 391
#note Gigi was running low on time and as a result was in a very tough spot.  Gigi's winning sequence here would probably take me a few minutes to find under ideal conditions...much less being low on time at the very end of the 8th game of the day with its requisite fatigue.   Gigi was under 2 minutes on her clock at the beginning of this turn and didn't make her play until she was down under 20 seconds if I remember correctly. The counterintuitive TRIP A5 6 still leaves her trailing by 11 points (her play of OAK was incorrectly scored as 44 instead of 46)...but it wins 100%.   Not only does it  block both of my out plays and set her up to go out in 2 places, but I won't be able to put enough points up before she goes out. If she plays TRIP, I block (ZA)p/pE/(WOK)E with OI at 1N for 6, which puts me up by 392 - 375 and leaves LI in my rack.  She then could go out with oE L11 14, getting 4 points from my rack and winning by 1 (which would become 3 after the inevitable recount).  Conversely if I ignore O1 and play LI I1 8, she then could hit me with the aforementioned ZAP/PE/WOKE for 23 and win that way.  Fortunately for me, she didn't see this due to time pressure.

#note Relief!
