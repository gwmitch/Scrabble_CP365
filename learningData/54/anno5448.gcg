#note Didn't know MAGUEY 2I, which sims best. Maybe overthought a little in not playing YAR 9C but I liked denying the easy TWS at H1.

#note Happy to find and choose the last two plays, as missing either of them would really have set me back.

>Sam: FILORTU 10J TOFU +18 179
#note TOFU K6 sims way better. I figured that meant he could block the E in COSIE and then I wouldn't have any bingo lanes next turn, possibly ever. With my TOFU I at least have two lines, and it's difficult for him to block both on this turn. Of course I'm open to suggestions though.

#note Champ player actually says there are six plays that win 100% of the time, and every other play loses every game! Who knows if that's correct, but it likes this play, with DE O3 coming in .4 valuation points ahead.
