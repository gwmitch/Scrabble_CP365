>Sam: EFLOOQU H7 F.QUE +17 17
#note Was very tired this morning, having idiotically gone to bed very late the night before, and started off with a terrible play, as I quickly realized after I hit my clock. FOOL 9H is a nice play, setting up a possible big play to the triple, but even QUOD is a simple improvement.
>Alyssa_Faria: EGILORS 12B GLORIES +87 103
>Sam: LNNOOVY 11H .NVOY +22 39
#note Missing LOONEY 11D, which looks better despite being worse for the board.

#note I'm not sure which exchange is right, but I'm pretty sure an exchange is the correct play.
>Alyssa_Faria: AEHL N10 HA.LE +32 243
>Sam: DHNOOST 15L HOST +42 151
#note HOOD and HOODS O8 both look like stronger plays.

>Sam: ADDENSW O1 DAW +28 261
#note WADE is probably better for some catch-up points.
>Alyssa_Faria: EFW M1 FEW +39 392

>Sam: DEEENPS --  -94 261
#note Imbecility. If I bingo I probably win.
>Alyssa_Faria: GINTUVY -GINTUVY +0 392
>Sam: DEEENPS J2 DEEPENS +75 336
#note 14F is probably better anyway.
>Alyssa_Faria: ?AEINRT K1 TERmINA +80 472
>Alyssa_Faria: ?AEINRT --  -80 392
#note Yeah, all seven of these were in the bag for me to pick after DEEPENs. At least I beat myself up enough about it for the rest of the tourney.
>Sam: AINPTUY 14M Y. +10 346
#note Was hoping against hope that PURITAN/RELIABLER* would be good. RELIABLE only takes an S hook.
>Alyssa_Faria: ?AEINRT 7H .A. +11 403
>Sam: AGINPTU L11 ..U +6 352
#note Again hoping to draw an R. PARTING would actually also fit at K1 in Sowpods.
