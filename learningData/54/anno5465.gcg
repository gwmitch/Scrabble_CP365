#note -3 to 11K FIG which i was going to do. i automatically laid this down, but the leave is too clunky.

#note i'm not leet enough to find the best play, which i leave as an exercise to the reader (see next play)  -14

>Cesar: AIIOSTY M11 .ITI +26 128
#note last answer was GNOSTIC. ZITI is clearly the best play here, but just last year i'm pretty sure i would have played ZIT, because i was too chicken. it still seems a bit scary to play ZITI, but i really don't have a choice.

#note sensing something was afoot, i felt like i had to block up here. quackle likes it too, but i didn't give it inferences. there probably isn't much else that makes sense.
>Derek: ?EIMRRS K2 MaRRIES +76 254
>Cesar: EEKNRTU B10 KENT +37 296
#note this is my first hasty move of the game. KUNE is a lot better, and i saw it, but i have no idea why i didn't play it. i think i was just stuck on playing UKE, because i get like that sometimes. it is the typical 1600-to-1800-expert rationality! -6. KEN is also better than KENT. this move is interesting too because my other choice was J4 EEK. i really should think it through a little more. derek can't hit the B10 hotspot as well as he can hit the 6J hotspot with an easy X play, so shouldn't i play there? i'm surprised EEK sims so low.
>Derek: GJ 6J J.G +27 281
>Cesar: ?AEERUX 13F EX +36 332
#note dang it, reseaux dont fit. quackle is telling me 13B TUX is the best play. i didn't really think about that. it is always nerve-wracking to open something like that for an opponent, but he can't really hit it with that pool, and i'm almost at 90% for a bingo after TUX. oh wel. (-12.5)

#note i know the best thing here is to block YANGS, which i saw, but once i saw i won like this, i didn't really wanna screw around. i was already 0-2 -200 something and i wasn't gonna win any money, so let's just salvage the win. E8 sURA blocks his out. (-9)
