#note i found the play in the last rack of crap - i give up at this point and start over. FEU holding EIUY just didn't seem worth it.

#note i miss the two legit eights that hit the triple line, and play this instead, and score it as 88. i think i'm getting tired.

>k8: ALLNSUZ A9 ULNA. +6 254
#note 10/31 unseen are vowels. i should pay better attention to such things. i wanted to keep my S and block this lane, and prevent setup plays along the B column; this is the only thing i could see to do, other than nurl, which would be better if i looked at vowels..
>st: EF F6 FE. +14 224
#note he scores this as 24 on his scoresheet, but i score it as 14.
>k8: BLMSSTZ O7 M.LT +12 266
#note i should play an S here, but with this board, i think keeping them may let me score with small plays later.
>st: DIN 14B D.N +20 244
#note scored as 18
>k8: BGSSTVZ -BGTV +0 266
#note we have hit an impasse. still stubronly keeping eses when there are 2 in the bag. dumb.

#note at this point, i think the score is 299-284, and he thinks it's 299-294.  it is actually 288-286.

>k8: BEPSSST 4F P.SES +8 326
#note this is the stupidest play ever if you think the score is what it is. i didn't actually see his outplay when i did it, either. i just saw this as an out in two when he didn't have an out, which would give me the win either way at what i had as the current score of 329-298.  this is a good time to verify the score, if you're either of us.

>st:  (BTS) +10 331
#note at this point, he thinks it's 339-337, his win, and i think it's 337-329, my win. we go back over his score first he sees the ten point error on his side, and just says he doesn't deserve to win and leaves it at that.  so... in reality, i went 8-11 at this tournament.
