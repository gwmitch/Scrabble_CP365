>Gary_Smart: AEPRT I5 PAT.ER +19 19
>Jim_Burlant: GIKMNRV 6H M.KING +23 55
#note Saw J4 VIM (quackle's first choice) and rejected it because I felt it didn't turn enough of the rack.  Regardless of what Quackle says, I don't like its first 2 choices.   (-2.9)   Incorrectly scored as 24.
>Gary_Smart: HO 5K HO +22 41
>Jim_Burlant: CENNRVY L4 C..EY +28 83
#note Had been planning to play VINERY through the I in MAKING and his play of HO killed that...and this position and the next one  are where I lost this game.   I knew the rack had to be turned.  I inexplicably didn't see ENVY (not a tough find) and it took a while just to find this play.  I think my choice would have most likely been CONVEY, which (unfortunately) I didn't see.  While this play scores well, this is a very poor play due to the leave and it justifiably takes a hit in the sim.
>Gary_Smart: INO 8L .ONI +21 62
>Jim_Burlant: ?NNRSVW -NVW +0 83
#note Got what I deserved for the poor play on the previous turn. Of course,GROWN M6 is a lot better than this - I was too fixated on getting rid of both the V and the W in one turn, which I couldn't do.    
>Gary_Smart: EEINQU H10 EQUINE +50 112
>Jim_Burlant: ?INRRSU 15A ReINSUR. +74 157
#note While I got the bingo down, this play shows the cost of having exchanged out of frustration/impatience on the previous turn rather than making the best play of (G)R(O)WN.  The IUR draw to NSV? would have resulted in UNIVeRS(E) for 92, and I would now be up 192 - 112 instead of 157 - 112.  Big difference.
>Gary_Smart: ILO D12 LOI. +8 120
>Jim_Burlant: AABEHIP E10 HEAP +24 181
#note Wasn't thrilled with shedding the E but felt that, in light of his probably getting ready to bingo on the next turn, I didn't want to be vowel-overloaded, which ABEI and AEIP could have led to with the wrong draw.    Quackle prefers C11 BAH or PAH, but not by much.
>Gary_Smart: ADEELRS J9 DEALERS +70 190
#note Incorrectly scored as 71.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AABBII 12J .ABIA +14 195
#note Quackle prefers K11 BI by a hair; I prefer not to be stuck with duplicated vowels if I don't have to.  This choice comes in 3rd, at 61% winning chances.  
>Gary_Smart: ENW K11 W.NE +28 218
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCIOTY 9M YO +20 215
#note I thought there might be something in this rack but the 24000-probability BIOTYPIC was way  beyond my skill set.  I brain-locked here and really wasn't happy when this was all I could come up with.  This was a mediocre play at best, with 10B BOTHY or 15J (S)YBO being much better choices.
>Gary_Smart: OTU F6 TO.U +9 227
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCEIST A8 BISECTo. +92 307
#note While Quackle says my winning chances are now > 90%, I told myself I wasn't out of the woods yet given my rack, the tile pool, and his prevoius play which told me he was potentially onto something.  
>Gary_Smart: OW 10N WO +27 254
>Jim_Burlant: AAADJNO D7 ANOA +10 317
#note I know JIAO is good but that's one of the power words I always forget to look for.  I felt that, given what I perceived (incorrectly) as a slightly vowel-overloaded pool, it might behoove me to clear out the vowel overload.  JACANA would probably have been best.  I thought (incorrectly) I'd draw into something that could help me play my J the next turn.
>Gary_Smart: ADEERST C3 DERATES +78 332
>Jim_Burlant: ADJLTUV O12 LAUD +27 344
#note And now I make the play that loses the game. Optios here are not good...but this was a poor choice; I was hoping he didn't thread the needle and draw both the X and the I, but I  panicked and felt I needed the points.   VELD or VELDT at 4B are the clear winners here for obvious reaosns, and I just was too fixated on the O column triple rather than thinking the game through properly.  

>Gary_Smart: IX N14 XI +39 371
>Jim_Burlant: GJLMOTV 13G V.M.. +17 361
#note Courtesy of all my blundering, my game is toast now.  JOT D2 theoretically sets me up to go out in 3 and win...only if he doesn't see GIVEN at 13G.  But I misplay this too, figuring that I'm probalbyl just going to have to save spread by going out ahead of him and saving my vowel to do so.
