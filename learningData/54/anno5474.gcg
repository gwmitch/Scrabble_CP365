#note HARDLY is a little better, more defensive and better leave. (-2)

#note somehow i missed PANNED at M2. but this is probably a marginal mistake. (-1)
>Isaac: AA 13L AA +16 167
>Cesar: ACJNRVW 4D CRAW. +20 234
#note quackle is liking 14L CRAW a lot more, which didn't occur to me. exchanging keeping CAN or CAR is another alternative. (-7.5)

>Cesar: INOOTUV D8 .IVOT +20 281
#note i spent forever on this move. i was about to do fouton, but you all would have laughed at me, so i decided against it. just keep playing the equity game and try not to look at the score, i tell myself. a bingo would be disastrous, so i gotta score.
>Isaac: EEEMST 1J ESTEEM +36 258
>Cesar: ?IMNOSU B6 .O.UM +20 301
#note unfortunately, i missed the bingo here (answer on next move). it's fairly difficult to find, at least for me. (-20)
>Isaac: Q 6G Q. +11 269
>Cesar: ?DIIINS 10D .ID +11 312
#note ok, i missed another bingo. the last one was MUONIUMS. this one is a bit easier, but this is quickly turning into a comedy of errors. even if i found it i think i would have chickened out, it seems like a trade name or something. E11 NIDI is what i was unable to find to balance the rack. (-36)
>Isaac: CDE 11C C.DE +23 292
>Cesar: ?IILNRS G6 .I +15 327
#note i was already having visions of losing despite drawing both blanks and being ahead with a decent leave. quackle likes 2N LI; i considered it, but if he bingoes in row 15 would i be in trouble? (-5.5)
>Isaac: EGK 14M KEG +26 318
>Cesar: ?ILNRSZ O12 ZI.S +72 399
#note ZIGS is definitely not right. i miscounted the number of tiles in the bag; for some reason i thought there was an extra one, i remember being very annoyed at myself and luckily i didn't track him for a bingo.  seems N13 LEZ is the only play that gives me a 100% win chance! (-20%)
>Isaac: EINORT A10 ORIENT +25 343

#note -3 MATRoNAL. i think isaac mistracked this one!
