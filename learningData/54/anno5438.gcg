>james: AEFINSU N5 IF +30 151
#note the 11 more points for NEIF are worth it - it's also probably better defensively.  Best play though is the funky e6 FUN(K)IA
>townsend: ABCDENR E5 CRAN.ED +56 139
#note 3rd best.  top is h7 C(OR)NBREAD.  next is the db/db BRAC(K)EN for 60.  Then adam's play, which he scored as 42.  Aren't i a nice guy for telling him he underscored by 14? he might need those points ....

#note in the sim this is very close to d11 or d6 EAU. It's actually tied in the lead though with 6c AU(R)A.  i guess this is a style choice play. still not sure which type of play is better.

>james: AEENOOT D10 AEON +13 187
#note  8a OATE(N) is very slgihtly better - which i would have played had i seen it.

#note best bingo

>james: DEFGOTU D1 FEUD +30 217
#note the two other possible plays are b6 FET for 37 which i didnt seriously consider, and 13b FU(N)GO for 18  which i did...  again, i'm still not sure.

#note WAD or WAT ?  i should've uncoupled the T. i was more worried about getting the other D, but this wasnt something i shoul've thought about. 2% error.

#note gives me a 25% win according to quackle's notoriously flawed win % calculator. Anything else is sub 12%.
>townsend: EEIOTVV M10 EVITE +20 400
#note 100% win. though 2a VIV(E) is 11 equity better.
>james: ADGPRST 14J PAG.D +30 404
#note i spent 10 minutes on this. i found the best equity play. though obviously i was trying to find the win that didnt exist..
>townsend: OV 2B VO. +12 412
#note best.  for those who are counting, the winning margin is 14 points.
