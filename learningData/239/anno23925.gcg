>Morris_Greenberg: AEENQVY 8F ENVY +20 20
#note NW: Actual rack.

MG: Playing vertically is for weaklings. As many of you know, a kitten dies for every time someone opens vertically.
>Noah: ?EEEIOS I7 E.E +8 8
>Morris_Greenberg: AAEFKMQ 9D FAME +17 37
#note MG: Considered FAME 7D and 9D and KE(N)AF G6. Quackle suggests K(E)EF F6, which is even better defensively than KENAF and scores more than all of the plays too. But, playing vertically is for weaklings. Cat lives matter.
>Noah: ?ABEIOS 10H ISOBArE +69 77
#note NW: Spent too long deciding between this and ABIOsES J1.
>Morris_Greenberg: AIJKMQU 8A QUAI +48 85
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: ADILNRV L8 VI.ND +26 103
>Morris_Greenberg: FIJKLMT 10B KIF +29 114
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: ABGILOR 12E GAOLBIR. +63 166
#note NW: GARBOIL is a bit more, but thought this could draw a challenge. 
>Morris_Greenberg: EJLMOTT 8L .OLT +21 135
#note MG: Oh, I can make a sneaky J set-up! Quackle prefers J9 M(O)J(I)TO, but cat lives matter.
>Noah: AASTUWW 13F TWA +23 189
>Morris_Greenberg: EEJLMTY 7M JEE +39 174
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: AOSTTUW 11E AW +22 211
>Morris_Greenberg: DLMRTUY 7C DRUM +31 205
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: AOSSTTU 14B AUTOS +23 234
#note MG: Many options here. I considered a bunch of row 14 plays and  ABORT/ABORTUS/ABORTS K9. ABORT is probably the best K9 play. I didn't think of rUST M10, which looks good, maybe best. This play seems really interesting but I'm feeling lazy atm -- curious to hear thoughts.

MG: AUTOS looks pretty good. According to my calculations, it kills 0 cats. Quackle does not disagree with this calculation.
>Morris_Greenberg: EILNTTY 15A LINEY +39 244
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: ENORSST 14H TENSORS +71 305
#note MG: Thought STERNOS* might've been new -- glad I chickened out! Maybe thinking of STRINES.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?CEILTT 15G CITE +34 278
#note MG: CLITTEr J1 is available for 63, but it opens up a ton of stuff, and cat lives matter. Quackle agrees in the sense that CITE sims 2% better than CLITTEr. I hope it also agrees that cat lives matter.
>Noah: ENNORRR 7I .RN +3 308
#note NW: Hilarious draw, but not a bad one. This play seems fine. Blocking the last lane is good, though I'm not out of the woods.

MG: Noah's draw is the jerkiest jerk draw of all time, as seen shortly.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?GLOPTZ 6B LOG +22 300
#note MG: Yes! I can keep PTZ? and if I draw an E or R, I get PRETZ(EL) N2 for 74 points! And this is a sweet decoy setup. Yes, it kills a cat, but pretzels are delicious. Little did I know that Noah drew everything awesome already. Cat lives matter.
>Noah: EINORRU K10 .U.R. +18 326
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ADDPTZ 11A DAD +14 314
#note NW: Actual rack -- great play by Morris.

MG: Even thinking about setting up my pretzel play vertically brings me shame here. Cat lives matter.
>Noah: CEINOOR A4 ROC +13 339
#note Thought that column A was the biggest threat here. Again I'm feeling lazy here. There's a good chance that this play is really really bad. Not sure what a good option is though.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AHPPTZ 15N HA +20 334
#note NW: Morris fished for PRETZEL again. Amazingly, he can also fish for HIPPO(GRIFF) here!!! Somebody mentioned it after the game -- pretty amazing that it's actually good. I thought it was Harry Potter original but in fact it comes from Virgil. 

MG: I concur with everything Mr. Walton said above. I would like to add to that statement, though, that cat lives matter.
>Noah: EEHINOX 4A .EXINE +26 365
#note NW: BEET I12 is one better.

MG: Noah meant to say that (TWA)E 13F is 1 better. (B)E(ET) kills more kittens. Cat lives matter.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?GIPPTZ 3D PuTZ +31 365
#note MG: Cat lives matter.
>Noah: HO B2 HO. +12 377
#note MG: Not only does Noah draw ERRR on one turn, he beats me and flaunts it by killing a kitten on the final move. Cat lives matter.
>Noah:  (GIP) +12 389
