>Martin_DeMello: IKTY F6 KI.TY +30 30
>Amalan_Iyengar: EHLNOSU J6 HU.LO +18 88
#note UNH(E)LES# is a word
>Martin_DeMello: ARUW K10 WAUR +19 49
>Amalan_Iyengar: ACDELNS 14E CANDLES +72 160
>Amalan_Iyengar: AABGOQZ (challenge) +5 165
#note CALENDS is slightly better, which I did not know with the C
>Martin_DeMello: EMO H12 MO.E +30 79
>Amalan_Iyengar: AABGOQZ 12J Q.AG +28 193
#note GAZABO is a word, but Q(U)AG is still probably slightly better
>Martin_DeMello: AEFIIPX I6 AX.E +45 124
>Amalan_Iyengar: AABINOZ 12D NIZA. +32 225
#note NIZAM is pretty bad. Quackle suggests BONA(C)I, which I didn't know, BAIZA K2, or E10 AZOI(C). BAIZA seems pretty good here
>Martin_DeMello: FOOR M9 FOR.O +26 150
>Amalan_Iyengar: ABCNNOU 11C CUB +24 249
#note BOUN(D) looks pretty good here, with only 3/50 tiles being As. Quackle suggests NUB or BOUN(D) over CUB. NUB seems a little bit too risky though
>Martin_DeMello: AGTTU K2 GUTTA +18 168
>Amalan_Iyengar: AANNOVY N8 NAY +32 281
#note NONA looks best here. NAVY is also pretty good. NAY is too risky, and hold a mediocre leave
>Martin_DeMello: ?DEORRW O9 REWORDs +95 263

#note PAVIO(R) here is best
>Martin_DeMello: AI G5 AI +8 313
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEHINOR 13F ON. +20 347
#note I iniitially laid down HAIR, then played ON(O). Quackle likes HO(Y)A, then HO(Y), then ON(O), even with rack inference of EST, which I'm guessing, since he's fishing with AI.
>Martin_DeMello: ?EGINOS 4A GOoNIES +71 384
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEEHINR A1 HIN.E +27 374
#note HE 3C apparently wins 40% of the time, but I think everything I play is going to be blocked pretty easily.
