#note AMIA at 9G simming a couple points better

>Jerry_Lerman: AAIJMNZ H11 AMAIN +33 98
#note 10G NINJA for 28 sims about 2.5 points better 

>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?CDDRSU 13H .DDUCeRS +76 85
#note Slotting that S sims a lot worse than playing the nice find CHUDDARS for 2 additional points.  I'd have missed it...but I wouldn't have challenged it.

#note N10 TETRA scores 18 and leaves no double letters.  It sims 8 points better than my trade. B10 RATTEN for 16 sims 6 points better
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AI 10J .A.I +14 239
>Jerry_Lerman: AEENRST N5 NEAREST +78 265
#note EARNEST is simming about 3 points better.  HAJI was costly for Cesar; presumably he holds an S also, or he'd not have created the opening.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEILN O5 ALIEN +29 268
>Jerry_Lerman: BELNTWW 11K B.N. +22 287
#note BUNT comes in near the top or at the top among the alternatives: BUTTE/ BUTT/ or WE at C12
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BOO F9 BOO +19 287
>Jerry_Lerman: AEGLTWW 9M W.. +20 307
#note I guess with 5 Es unseen, C12 WE for an extra point is worth it.  I will have the T hook on WO, but so would my opponent probably (3 Ts unseen). It was fear of creating a usable opening for my opponent that steered me away from WE.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: GI C12 GI +15 302
>Jerry_Lerman: AEEGLTW B13 GE. +13 320
#note GEN wasn't among the first 15 choices generated, but it simulates 3rd best.  B10 for WEEL or WEAL, each of which scores 10 more points than GEN, sims better by 5 or 3 points.  WEEL being best.  I wanted to keep the board very closed, so I didn't pass up the chance to close down the opening that Cesar must have wanted very much.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEFR 5K FRE.. +16 318
>Jerry_Lerman: AAELLTW L4 T.AWL +18 338
#note Here I used "Ask Championship Player" - as the bag is getting smaller.  It came back resoundingly with TRAWL (I'm pleased to say).  M1 WALLET was its 2nd choice, but was valued 6 points lower.  Win expectation for TRAWL was 59%, WALLET 57%
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ATU K3 TU.A +11 329
>Jerry_Lerman: AELPPRT J2 PEP +20 358
#note Championship Player (sim doesn't agree) found J2 PER to be the best.  That A front hook would exclusively belong to me!   Win expectation is nearly 84%.  My choice of PEP came in 6th (REP/PET/PAP/TAP ahead of it) with 67% win prob.  Simulation seemed stuck on APPLET, TAPPET, LAPPET plays from 3F - creating all sorts of openings that Cesar could quite possibly exploit.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ELRT 3G REL.. +7 336
>Jerry_Lerman: AEILRTT H1 TR.AT +18 376
#note Cesar's holding a playable QUICHES, so I need to block the line under the RE and not create another line.  ALEE is the best, according to Championship Player, with my choice TREAT coming in 11 points lower - but still with a 100% win prob.  My playing the T off creates a high scoring Q play for Cesar.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: CEHIQSU 5D QUES. +28 364
#note QUIETS for two more, according to Championship player.
>Jerry_Lerman: EIL 6B LEI +16 392
#note Cesar will lose 20 points on time also.
>Jerry_Lerman:  (CHI) +16 408
