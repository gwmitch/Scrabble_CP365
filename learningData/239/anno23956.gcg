#note Or H1 TRIPLY, which gives him more bingo floaters but also ends the game quicker. This also prevents a play like A12 ZAPS, which in combination with a bingo is probably his best way to get back into the game, so looks OK

#note Wasn't positive this was good (it is), but it is so much better than everything else and not an easy word for Jeremy to challenge off. He held but correctly accepted.

#note Spread was totally irrelevant in this game (winner gets 3rd and loser gets 4th no matter what), so no reason to be greedy with F10 WE like I might if it was early in the tournament.

#note Seems like I played pretty much perfectly this game, right? Looking over the board, everything looks go-- 

WAIT A SECOND...

SAXIFORM is not a word!!! I was basically positive it was good when I played it, and Jeremy held for a long time, ultimately choosing to let it go because I looked so confident when playing it and had played it almost instantly. The funny thing is, I was so confident it was valid that I was actually hoping he would challenge! 

To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest-scoring phony I have ever gotten away with in a tournament AND the highest-scoring phony Jeremy has ever allowed in a tournament. Thanks to him for being such a good sport about it (I wasn't planning to post this game, but, despite being on the worse end of it, he was so amused that he requested I upload it!)
