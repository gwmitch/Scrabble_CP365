>michal_josko: ADEEORY 13G YAR +27 328
#note fun starts now. im worried about unseen q and dont wanna open board. also see danger of bingo on B line. i know my opponent can do that. decided to go for points with 2 or 3 letter words. YAD YAE YA or YAR. decided that i may need D later . final decision YAR
>sevens: ABELNOR 10B OR.A +21 356
>michal_josko: ?DEOOPS 13K OPE. +18 346
#note another tough choice. q still unseen. should i block q spots or keep it open. i see 5 spots for q , so kinda too many. i need points anyway. OPES is the best and most points too.

too bad i cant play any of the homeless bingos i see - poodles, spooned,, spooked...
>sevens: BELMNOO 14J OBO +22 378
#note best
>michal_josko: ?DDOQRS O10 ODD +18 364
#note here you are q. i see he may not be able to run out of tiles in 2 turns, so i need to keep going for points. i totally didnt see QATS at O6. i knew that i can keep q because he cant block it. Althought i missed that QAT, i still saw QI/ION QI QI/IMAGE. 
I really like my choice, quackle not really

>sevens: EGLMNR 11M M.. +6 384
#note sevens clock 0:36.  quackle proposes to open board and make MERLON MELON or LEMON.  problem that alll this choices will let me have another Q spot.
>michal_josko: ?QRS D10 .....S +22 386
#note again im sure he wont run out of tiles in two turns and i still have two spots( even 3 but still dont see damn QAT) for Q so the  Q can wait. there are few interesting choices, like AFARS RAUPOS but they will let me be stuck with the q. was looking where to play S for most points and get ahead. i did
>sevens: EGLNR 10G L...ER +12 396
#note sevens after game said he should do FAR/REVET. quackle still slightly prefers LUNIER
>michal_josko: ?QR K3 Qi +17 403
#note now time to play the bloody q. the gamble paid off
>sevens: GN B9 G.. +4 400
>michal_josko: R K6 ..R +14 417
#note for a moment i thought R  might be homeless. it wasnt and it had 14 points. Sevens also mentioned after the game that he didnt see possible QI/IMAGE play
