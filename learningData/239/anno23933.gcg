#note Don't think VI(C)AR makes sense here, but I'm already far behind.

#note I was very confused that he had chosen to play there, blocking my bingos, but this isn't the worst thing for me, as this scores well anyway. Sal says he had all consonants
>Joshua_Sokol: IIII -IIII +0 189
#note keeping three consonants it seems. Not usually a good idea, but perhaps merited here, as if he draws just one vowel he should be able to score well.

>Bernard: GIMNORY B2 GRIMY +65 301
#note Just sailing along here. Looking briefly for a bingo but missed (a)GRIMONY at 6A. Tough! 4 more points seem good here.
>Joshua_Sokol: CILT 7C CLIT +16 241
#note I felt like I was in business here.
>Bernard: DEFINOR E10 .N.FED +28 329
#note Definitely thought this was the correct play, given that there were SSS? in the pool. This also scored well and forced his hand.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGINT 15E .EBATING +92 333
#note Incredible
>Bernard: GIOORUU 3B .IGOUR +16 345
#note DEBATING and this draw completely crushed me. I still have a chance, though. Perhaps I can draw into something.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHIPSW H1 WISH +50 383
#note Actual rack. Good to forgo the bingo here.
