#note Can't wait to see how badly I blew this one.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEIPRY 7H PYE +16 16
>Jeremy_Hall: EO 6J OE +8 30
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIORS 9C ORACIES +79 95
#note New words also have anagrams sometimes. SCORIAE is better, in the same spot
>Jeremy_Hall: ?AEGOPR 5G PORtAGE +74 104
#note D8 P(R)OGRAdE or P(R)OGERiA look better than this
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGNORZ H1 GONZ. +75 170
#note This results orientation/punishment for Jeremy's mistake was way out of proportion
>Jeremy_Hall: IILLORT 3A TRILLIO. +68 172
#note But then again, this makes things better. ZEBR(A)NO was the other option last turn, for 72. Doesn't give him this :/
>Joshua_Sokol: BDENORT E5 REBO.NT +36 206
#note I got way too focused on this 2x2. Took forever looking for bingos that didn't exist here. 8J DEBTOR is definitely better here
>Jeremy_Hall: AUV A1 VA.U +24 196
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDFINS 10H DIF +24 230
#note forgetting about the PORTAGE hooks and missing FIND, which isn't necessarily better. But I can't be missing things like that. This was at least the correct choice between 8A FAD keeping DINS or FID in the same spot, just based on probability and math alone. DINS bingos more, but DIF is just all around better in the long run, that's to say the 2/3 of the time or so I do not draw into a bingo, I do worse than the 7/10 of the time I don't bingo after DIF. To be brief, board shape, man, board shape.
>Jeremy_Hall: AEIILNR N3 AIRLINE +69 265
#note This is one of the rare, but stunning occurences of me letting something this blatant go. I just had no confidence in my word knowledge vs. my opponents' at this tournament, and I couldn't afford to lose a challenge here. Jeremy also had (G)AINLIER here, which I didn't see, for lack of time to look at all of his options, but which I sort of assumed he had. I didn't think this was his only option, which is silly, because he could really only have something else in a few spots. I could have taken the time to see GAINLIER, and then my reasoning for letting this go could have at least been valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADMNNSS O1 DAMNS +45 275
#note could have lost the game then and there, if Jeremy had purposely phoneyed. That would have been sweet justice for my idiocy!
>Jeremy_Hall: AAK 8L KA.A +39 304
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ENRSUY O8 .NEURYSm +85 360
>Jeremy_Hall: EGIMST M7 G.MIEST +43 347
#note Jeremy interestingly goes for the scoring route to try and win with. I definitely had a rack that he could outrun me with, but I don't know how likely it is for him to win after GAMIEST with a random rack. Seems pretty implausible. In any case, it's not as if he has exhausted his bingo opportunities, but the pool is pretty ugly, and there is really only one good spot to go.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFITTUW M1 WIT +22 382
#note Wasn't liking my opportunities after 8A FEW, but scoring 32 just really takes away a lot of momentum for Jeremy, so I should have just gone with it. Instead I chose paranoia. Sure, I blocked his HA/HAIRLINE play for 32, so what? Sure, EFTU can score better than ITTU next turn, so what? Fancy play syndrome at its most unrecognizable 
>Jeremy_Hall: DEV D1 VE.D +24 371
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFOTTU L11 FOU +23 405
#note 12H FOETU(S). BAM. Game blown. This is not a good play. I missed the good play. I think I saw D8 T(R)OUT, which is also a good play. Why didn't I play that?
>Jeremy_Hall: EJW 8A JEW +44 415
>Joshua_Sokol: AABEHTT F6 HA +30 435
#note B2 A(R)HAT. Another heart-wrenching miss. Apparently this is better but how could it be. 
>Jeremy_Hall: CEHLOUX F11 OUCH +19 434
#note Jeremy had a lot of time to find a way to win, but this is the only way to do so. What a find under so much pressure. This was definitely world-class on his part, and on my part I was crushed.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDENTT 11I BE +14 449
#note Desperately trying to block with no time left. No way to win, just give him one more turn to hopefully screw up.
>Jeremy_Hall: ELX F2 X. +25 459
#note But he also had another out in 11C EX(TO)L!!! What?!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADNTT 13F .ANT +8 457
#note Time ran out.
