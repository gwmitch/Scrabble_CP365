#note Probably too cute. I know that an open board was something I wanted against stephen, but I also want to avoid variance in a "hit and I win, miss and I lose" game against a lower-rated opponent. MESTIZ(O) is a cool option as well, and ZI(L)L is the standard equity play. didn't realize I was forgoing this many points of valuation though...

#note The big question: do you forego 6 points to play this on the right? The only way to lose this game is to get bingoed on for 100 along O and then not be able to bingo with my two blanks (which is sort of likely given the board shape). Ultimately I decided that that was silly and I should play offense.

#note I was pretty sure this was no good (it's only WEAPONS) but I thought stephen would probably not challenge a two-blank bingo. PICOWAVE/WALLOPED/WALLOPER/POLEWARD are valid options I didn't see.
