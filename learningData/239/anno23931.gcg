#note huh, WARSTLE takes an R, this does not. Weird. This was held for a bit.

#note lucky he did not have an I to go with his Q, but if he didn't play there, 11I H(A)D(J) for 36 is very strong.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIMRS 9L .M +14 231
#note Missing MISREFER, and making an iffy play. I could not remember if CROUPE was good or not, and decided to play it safe and block it. This kept a good leave as well as blocking the biggest threat to my lead, a bingo down to CROUPE or CROUPS that opens the top of the board. Apparently this blocked something, if I remember correctly, but it still did not work out well for me. MISREFER was a bad miss. I wanted to have played 15A FREE after this, but it seemed he couldn't do much damage at 15A. Boy was I wrong.
>Wes_Eddings: ACMS 15A SCAM +45 159
#note scoring 45, now within striking distance. I miss, and he opens a huge spot for himself that it tough to block without sacrificing a lot of points. Bad! Wes was already very low on time here (below 10 minutes), so I hoped that would help me.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEFIRS 13A FEE +18 249
#note Still unsure of CROUPE, so allotted to block the S instead. 
>Wes_Eddings: ?AORTTU N1 TARTUfO +67 226
#note blocked him, but I'm in trouble now.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFILRSV 1J RIVE.S +39 288
#note No way I can deal with all the openings on the board now, so no use playing VE(T)S instead.
>Wes_Eddings: IKP B10 PIK. +16 242
>Joshua_Sokol: DDFGILU C6 FULGID +21 309
#note Almost played FLUG* again!!!
>Wes_Eddings: AAILNOT B1 ALATION +77 319
#note Pulling ahead, without any of the two remaining eses, blowing the board even more open? I started to freak out a bit here! What happened? Of note, D4 ALATION is 84 and safer.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGGOO A5 GOGO +31 340
>Wes_Eddings: AHY A1 HAY +49 368
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEIRT 2D TRIBADE +68 408
#note Lucky to have drawn into this one, but I'm in no way out of the woods. All I need is to run into a problematic rack in the endgame, and Wes just needs to bank 40 points. Not as unlikely as I would have liked.
>Wes_Eddings: EEINOSX L1 .IXENS +32 400
#note -4 to 4B (T)OXINES to block my outs.
>Joshua_Sokol: EENSW E2 .ENEWS +18 426
#note I almost talked myself out of (T)WEENS at this rate, until I saw that I didn't need to play it to make the best endgame play.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EO) +4 430
#note Wes went a minute over on time. 430-390. Unhappy about this win, I felt like I had little to no control over the result. Don't make mistakes!
