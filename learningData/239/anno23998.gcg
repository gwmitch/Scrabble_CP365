#note Quackle seems to like FOVEA/FAVE in the same place. I don't like opening the triple enough to justify FOVEA for me.

>Amalan_Iyengar: DFJPRUW 11C WUD +20 119
#note Bad play. K8 DW(A)RF, JA(U/R)P, or UPDR(A)W# are much better. Also, forgot that JUD# was a word

#note U(P)FILL# sims best, which I did not know. Other than that (P)ICUL, which I also didnt know, looks good.

#note L(EX) 9M is simming highest. THat seems overly fishy with only one lane, which requires the S. CLA(W)ING sims second. I considered both CLA(W)ING and CA(W)ING. Taking the extra points probably isn't worth it in this situation, but I have no bingo lanes apart from (JARP)S
>Stefan_Rau: HIN J6 HIN +28 341
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?EELLOO 5B OLE +7 245
#note Thisis a very bad play. It's overly fishy, and very volatile. LO(G)E is a much better play. It forks the board and isn't as easy to block.
>Stefan_Rau: ?ADEELO A4 BRAIL +34 375
#note Yup
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADELO L7 ALO. +14 259
#note I don't have the last tile. I wrote it down as an E, but that's impossible. This does a much better job at opening than OLE
>Stefan_Rau: FO D11 .FO +24 399
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?DEOTTU M1 TUTOrED +73 332
#note TEsTUDO is best, and wins 13% of the time, instead of 2

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AEOQRR 9F O.. +8 340
#note No play wins here, but OYE#/ON gives me the only real shot at winning. If I draw the S, then CAWINGS#/SQuARER will win, on the offchance he doesn't block it. I think it was way too risky, and should've gone with a safer play, dumping the Q.
