>Mark_Pistolese: AGIMNTU 8D MUTING +24 24
#note Interesting first rack for Mark. This is reasonable. Perhaps I would play short instead. Not sure. I think I would have played MUTING with the U on the star if I played MUTING, sacrificing 2 points to give less back.
>Joshua_Sokol: ALNOOTV F4 LOVA. +16 16
#note Missing D8 (M)OVANT. This wasn't a great start for me, but LOVA(T) is fine.
>Mark_Pistolese: AANZ 9B AZAN +29 53
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNOT 10A ENATION +84 100
#note Could have played a 9 here, but this is definitely better.
>Mark_Pistolese: CFH A8 CH.F +53 106
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEOUWY E3 YEW +30 130
>Mark_Pistolese: AEHV 11F HAVE +17 123
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIOOTU 12B BUTEO +20 150
#note Was first going to play D1 BOOT. I missed OBOE there, which is another option. Then this, which seemed the most balanced with an even game at my hands, seemed like the play to make. I am comfortable on this board, but perhaps I shouldn't be. 
>Mark_Pistolese: DEX 3B DEX. +30 153
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIIOST B2 I.IOT +16 166
#note Now my leave looks squashed, unless I can make something happen for next turn. B12 (B)IO was tempting, but I'm not desperate yet. 
>Mark_Pistolese: ALTU H11 .AULT +27 180
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIIIRS -EII +0 166
#note Not in great shape now. Hopefully next turn is the one where I can do something.
>Mark_Pistolese: ADEGP 13A GAPED +35 215
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIRSS J9 cERISES +71 237
#note First I looked for something ending in T at 15A, and saw nothing. Saw that I had a couple of options beginning in T, but I chose to keep stuff closed here, and hope I can just outplay Mark from here on out. I'm not sure I should have, since my lead is not large.
>Mark_Pistolese: BY B12 ..BY +22 237
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGJLNU D1 LU.E +30 267
>Mark_Pistolese: ACDEK 15J .ACKED +48 285
#note ouch
>Joshua_Sokol: EGJNOOR M12 JOO. +30 297
#note I overlooked how many vowels were left when I saw all the remaining I's. This was a mistake, since A1 JO becomes the best play with the current ratio. I also saw G(Y)RON, which is a good alternative play to outscore and keep vowels. 
>Mark_Pistolese: OSW N12 OWS. +32 317
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFGNRR 15A R.ND +30 327
#note Now I am in terrible shape. I cannot address any of the threats on this board, and have to hope I get the best of the bag.
>Mark_Pistolese: IO 14F OI. +5 322
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGLMRR 13L F..L +10 337
#note It gets worse, folks. I miss GLE(D) for 30. But with a play like OI(L), the blank might still be out there. So F(E)RREL for 16 to go for something would make sense, except that the Q is also out, and that's something to possibly worry about, since he can fish and I can't stop him if I have the Q, since I am not far enough ahead. But definitely GLE(D) makes sense here. FOWL is not bad, but I have to hope he screws the pre-endgame up.
>Mark_Pistolese: R 10J .R +2 324
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIMPRR 13G M. +14 351
#note And here I make an outrageous choke, and show Mark my rack. I almost played GRIMPER, but I laid it down on the board. But I caught a glimpse of Mark writing down the pool from his perspective, and knew what was in the bag because of it. I had to draw the blank. If I fish my P off or my M, that would be fine, except he would then know what I was fishing for, and block the R. I knew he had RETINAS, so I just had to hit my own bingo, but it's only a 1/3 shot. I can hit PEREGRI(N) to the N or GRIPIER. 
>Mark_Pistolese: AEINRST L4 STAINER +69 393
#note Mark makes an excellent play here, blocking my fish, hoping I didn't draw the blank.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIPQRR 4A Q. +21 372
#note That's all, folks. I had no time, and slapped this down. Obviously I should play QI for 24.
>Mark_Pistolese: ?I 5A I.n +13 406
