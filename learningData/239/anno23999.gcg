>Bernard_Gotlieb: ANTUV H4 VAUNT +24 24
>Joshua_Sokol: BGIMNOV 6G V.M +8 8
#note This is cute, but doesn't really score enough to justify itself, I would say. But it's quite defensive. OV(U)M is simming to the top. Everything else gives back so much more!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EEW 8E WEE. +7 31
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGINO 3B BEGONIA +81 89
#note lucky!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AAEELMS B1 AM.LE +18 49
#note Bernard missed A(B)EAM. He tends to be very polarized against me, once a paranoid defensement, once a daredevil attacker!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADILNUY 1A Y.UD +30 119
#note Could have taken more time to consider A1 YA for 4 more. But no, I don't need that U!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AA 2F AA +10 59
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKLNO A4 ENOKI +35 154
#note no-go!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEEGLRS 1G REGALES +80 139
>Joshua_Sokol: ACJLOPT E6 CO.PAT +26 180
#note Regretted this route quickly, after minutes of debating whether or not it made sense to keep the J here. If I want to keep the J, I should play F5 POL(E)CAT, which I missed. Or even the defensive 7D CAPO(N), giving Bernard no easy scoring decisions. I didn't like the iffiness of JOL(E) F5 keeping ACPT, especially with the pool. I also didn't like the scoring options B8 TAJ gave back, but I should have played that anyway. Ugh, JL sucks! ;)
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EFO 2L FOE +19 158
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHJLNR 10B JEH.D +36 216
#note Could and should have given more thought to just H(A)J. Lots of I's to come, I hit a bingo fairly often, and when I don't, that's OK too. With LNR, not as much of the "OK, I didn't hit".
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BEFIRST C7 BRI.FEST +84 242
#note Not sure Bernard would have seen FIBSTER or had the guts to play FIBSTER/COWPATS if I hadn't give him a spot. :/
>Joshua_Sokol: LNOOPRR D12 LOOP +26 242
#note Missed 3M PRO, which is slightly less abysmal than this
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AQT 3J QAT +18 260
>Joshua_Sokol: IINRRSU 15D .URIN +21 263
#note Big break here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ACLT 14G TALC +16 276
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IINRSS 4J INS +33 296
#note Thought that it was useless to look for a bingo here. Missed RAISINS and saw RISINGS, was unsure of it, but figured this must be better anyway. I have the case S, and a blank. If Bernard manages a bingo after this, I will have a prime lane all to myself, unless he knows TALCY+. Him bingo-ing on column is unlikely, but even if he is, I'm usually in the lead after my own bingo, or I can fish.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DI 4D ID +15 291
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIRRSU K8 HURRIeS +75 371
#note wondered about cURRISH, thought it made little difference, and I was unsure. He probably would have challenged unsuccessfully. Meh
>Bernard_Gotlieb: GO L7 GO +10 301
#note Naturally Bernard has to go for the blank here and hope I am stuck with unplayable junk. B10 (J)OG is better, in this sense, as if Bernard draws what he needs to draw, he doesn't need an extra lane. I can't block the entire board. And the score is close enough that the 10 extra points are extremely important, as you will see!
>Joshua_Sokol: EINWXYZ M6 WINZE +38 409
#note My only winning play, amazingly. I just barely made it. 
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?DEIORT O2 sTEROID +80 381
#note Had Bernard played (J)OG, I originally calculated that I could only manage to tie with 8J W(H)INEY. He would have to see I(N)DEnTOR M7, his best bingo. 

But wait!!!! Bernard actually could have won! I realized this after seeing WHINEY over the board. There is an insane sequence in this endgame, that I originally calculated would win by 37 points, but that's because a) I forgot to add W(H)INEY to my score while calculating, which means I actually win by 11. This involves sticking me with the Z, which I have no spot for. But wait! I also missed one key possibility with one of his tiles, that scores 12 more than the next best option! So in reality, his best sequence in the endgame seemingly wins by 1 point, and there is nothing I can do.
>Bernard_Gotlieb:  (XY) +24 405
#note The winning sequence I found is that I play W(H)INEY, he plays (JEHAD)I to block my best X spot, I play N2 (E)X to block his best spot to score with his blank, SOS/QATS for 28, he plays AMBLED/ON B1, and I have to pass, so he continues with JEHADIS, JEHADIST(!), G6 (V)O(E), I6 (M)E, and finally D7 (B)R(O). 

BUT!! I should not play N2 (E)X, since JEHADIS+JEHADIST scores a combined 35, whereas QATS/SOS+K3(AN)T scores 34, so if I play my X with (SO)X, we tie!!!

So we just end up tying with perfect play, but in completely different endgame scenarios!
