>Jason_Li: ABCILTY 8H LYTIC +26 26
#note Jason almost played CITABLY*, but thought better of it. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOPTW L8 .OWPAT +26 26
>Jason_Li: ABDIOSU K10 OUD +24 50
#note Jason said he looked a while so as not to miss an overlap, but ended up missing AUDIO
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEGLO M10 LOGE +30 56
#note I sensed an S here for some reason, even though that would have been unlikely, and so M11 OGEE was off the table, especially since I didn't have an S or a D yet.
>Jason_Li: ABIINSV J8 .AB +26 76
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEOOPS N12 OE +11 67
#note Now, despite thinking he has the S, I decide that it's best I play this anyway to be aggressive, since I am not ahead. An S was already valuable enough on this board. I considered the possibility of drawing two vowels, but decided it was worth the risk here given the reward I would get a decent amount of the time. I saw O(L)EO for 4 and decided that just gave him too many spots to score, even if he had an S. 
>Jason_Li: AIIINSV O8 VINAS +35 111
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAEOPS 7H AA +11 78
#note Was not happy with this. Perhaps I should have exchanged.
>Jason_Li: EEHIIIX -EIIIX +0 111
#note 6I HIE is worth playing, I would say. Jason disagreed. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFOPSV 6F FOP +21 99
#note Was between this and FOVEA 6D. I miscounted 6I, I believe. I think that's better than 6D, although it does give back much in the realm of scoring opportunities for Jason as well. After an exchange, those are usually not a good idea.
>Jason_Li: DDEHNRW 5D DREW +26 137
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENSTV 4G TAVErNS +76 175
#note Thought it was worth sacrificing 7 points to give nothing back now that I had the lead. I actually lose 14 points immediately if I play 14F NATiVES. Since Jason seems consonant-y and heavy, it is not a good idea to open.
>Jason_Li: DEGHMNR 9G HM +19 156
#note His options really sucked here. This was the best he could do, it looks like. I thought about MEG(A) when we reviewed this position, but keeping the E is too important.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIORU F9 OURIE +15 190
#note I felt good about the 5-point sacrifice here, given Jason's last play. This blocks the S lane on COWPAT, and all of the other lanes for 7s. What happened next was beyond appalling.
>Jason_Li: DEEEGNR D2 GEN.ERED +74 230
#note Ouch. This would be fine, but my draw after OURIE was not very fun.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEILST 3C A. +4 194
#note Yup, I'm confined to either pure fishing for 4 or half-fishing for 11. The last A seemed to help me a lot, so I decided it was best to keep it. C2 AA was off the table. I unfortunately failed to consider 3L AI, which retains a better leave than C2 AA, and scores 10. With this pool, it also seems to bingo equivalently to keeping AEILST. This was a fatal mistake. 
>Jason_Li: AEHIKSX B2 SHEIK +50 280
#note Jason has nothing to worry about now, he is smooth sailing, with 50 points and a superb leave to boot. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILSTT H6 ....ITATES +45 239
#note Whereas I had to hold SHEIK for 3 minutes before I convinced myself that there was no way both of us were making it up. And all of this while losing a heck of a lot of time looking for bingos that weren't there for 2 turns straight. Luckily this popped up, and did just as well as a bingo would have.
>Jason_Li: ABLNTXY -  +0 280
#note Jason challenges, allowing me an extra turn to make up for scoring 4 points earlier. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILNQR A1 QI +35 274
#note And with this easy play, I'm not in the worst shape. Now if I could only make something happen next turn.
>Jason_Li: ABLNTXY 8A LAT.X +36 316
>Joshua_Sokol: CEFILNR 13B INFL.C. +30 304
#note Damn, he even gave me more lanes! I couldn't remember if INFECTER was valid, so I decided not to blow the game over it. Ironically this was probably what lost me the game. INFECTER is just a better play, even though it doesn't keep a precious vowel. I need to score as much as possible so that I can maximize my opportunities to win. Hopefully I can also draw the other blank. INFECT, however, is a better version of INFLECT, since the LER leave is just better than ER with this tile pool: it lowers the chances of duplicating my R, and draws into more bingos due to synergy, despite the lack of vowels. 
>Jason_Li: BDIJNYZ M1 JIB. +26 342
#note Jason had run out of time, and saw he could draw ZAYIN two ways if he drew the blank. DJIN(S) 15D seems correct here, as it is much tougher for Jason to get outrun here than for him to lose to a bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGOORRR 2D .OR +6 310
#note This was the fourth crushing draw I experienced this game. I usually don't draw this poorly (nobody does), so it's a good experience for me to push myself to do better. As for my thought process here, I felt I needed to open a new threat and hopefully hit something next turn. Was very grim, but what else was there?
>Jason_Li: DMNUUYZ H1 DUM. +21 363
#note Jason had run out of time, as previously mentioned, and laid this down with a shrug. YUZU(S) at 15D was what he missed, which would have made it tougher for me to win. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGNORR B10 GOR.ER +22 332
#note Ugh :(... B12 ERRING is the play, as I get at least 30 for (J)OE in that case.
>Jason_Li: ?INUYZ 2J ZaY.N +72 435
>Joshua_Sokol: EN A14 NE +14 346
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IU) +4 350
#note Don't make mistakes!
