>Joey_Krafchick: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDIMOW K3 MIAOW.D +26 66
#note L4 ADMI(X) looks like a sound alternative to this. I missed it, the word hadn't come up in a while... This isn't bad though, for the situation I was in. Going ahead 66 with a decent leave and many places to score.
>Joey_Krafchick: ADEHT J2 DEATH +42 42
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGNNPV 9G VAN +16 82
#note Missing 4G NAV(AI)D, the clear best play here. I also considered 4I V(AI)N for a while, but disliked that it didn't to much to the board. I also disliked that this gave a spot for (VAN)E(D)... NAVAID was staring me in the face!
>Joey_Krafchick: AEFOR L1 AFORE +32 74
#note all bad now
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGNNPR 1K P.NED +24 106
#note At least I drew a vowel
>Joey_Krafchick: HO 2L .OH +30 104

>Joey_Krafchick: ABELOST J8 .ETABLOS +73 177
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGNRRS 11G ENR.GERS +68 174
#note With the same letters in the same order I could have played H6 EN(LA)RGERS. I looked through the LA and missed it. I knew this was probably phony, but I felt like I was in such bad shape that I had to do it.
>Joey_Krafchick: ANTY 15H NA.TY +36 213
>Joshua_Sokol: IIIMNOS 12D IMINO +21 195
#note Paying for my mistakes.
>Joey_Krafchick: AW 7K .AW +22 235
>Joshua_Sokol: IIORSTU E6 TOURIS. +18 213
#note I had no idea what that last play was about, but I knew I needed a blank to stay in this game at this stage. The S seemed worthless compared to the blanks. I also needed to keep the board open.
>Joey_Krafchick: S 3J ...S +18 253
#note This completely threw me off.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIUV M9 VA.IED +28 241
#note I assumed he had at least one blank. I needed to score and hit next turn, so perhaps 13I E(L)UVIA? It was too late
>Joey_Krafchick: ??AEEII 2C AErIfIE. +59 312
#note I couldn't believe this play! He fishes an S off and then plays a 5-vowel 8 with two blanks??
>Joshua_Sokol: BEKTUUY 1A YUK +36 277
>Joey_Krafchick: CG H1 C.G +18 330
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGQTUZ 10D B.Z +34 311
#note Burned a whole lot of time here. This was a good draw, as I can score my way to victory with the right pulls. Unfortunately I missed the possibility of UBIQ(U)E! I was definitely aiming at that spot in the next couple of turns, but T(I)Z over B(I)Z hits UBIQUE with an I, and that would definitely propel me to victory. Damn!
>Joey_Krafchick: CLO N5 COL +17 347
>Joshua_Sokol: EGPQRTU L10 T.G +16 327
#note Hoping for PERIQUE or PULQ(U)E. PERIQUE is the draw that would win it for me, since I have QUIP(U) as well. Just playing my G off allows me to fish for PULQ(U)E or TORQ(U)E with an L or an O, and leaves one in the bag for complicative purposes. I guess going for the 2/9, hoping he doesn't block, is superior to going for EI or L and hoping he misses PULQUE. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EFIJNOT D4 JOIN +26 373
#note -2 to F4 FEINT. I tried to sneak a victory in here due to Joey being seemingly distracted from the game in many of his plays. He seemed to be auto-piloting a lot, but only his side will show what really happened. He told me he kept 4 vowels and two blanks with EMOS, because he didn't want to bingo for 64, and that he missed PULQUE as a possibility. Luckily his endgame play happened to block the spot. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EILPQRU 14D PIQUE +38 365
>Joey_Krafchick: EFT 3A EFT +26 399
#note -4 to milking with 6I T(HO). Joey is still undefeated against me!
>Joey_Krafchick:  (LR) +4 403
