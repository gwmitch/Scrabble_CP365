>Joshua_Sokol: BEEENRV H4 BREVE +26 26
>Steve_Ozorio: AGHTU G8 AUGHT +12 12
#note overscored by 2, and is twice as valuable making BREVET!
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILNOR 12C RELA.ION +68 94
>Steve_Ozorio: ABIMORT J5 TAMBORI. +66 78
#note Steve really knows how to phony! This was the beginning of my struggles with beating this man. Underscored by 1.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIOXY K5 AHOY +40 134
#note Underscored by 2, making 4/5 plays misadded!
>Steve_Ozorio: DEFORST 13I DEFROST +94 172
#note Underscored by 2, hooking his phony to make another phony! I had held TAMBORIN*, but since I was pretty sure TAMBORINE* was good, I imagined TAMBORIN* was too! This is why OXY would not have been better last turn, in the same spot. I thought I could hit a huge X play underneath.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIINSX 14M XI +31 165
#note Not sure if you all got the math joke on my last play. I'm not one to joke about math much, probably because I once lost a challenge on MATHY*. From that day on, I kept my math shut.
>Steve_Ozorio: ?LNNRTU D6 TUNNeL.R +58 230
#note Steve's first correctly-scored word of the match! This is why you really should count your opponent's plays as well as your own. I don't know when I started doing that, but it's a very good idea. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINOS 15L DONE +34 199
#note This was overscored by 6 on my part. I think I tripled the D...
>Steve_Ozorio: AGQ 7C Q.AG +24 254
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOSWY 8J ..WAYS +63 262
#note This was a good find for a kid my age
>Steve_Ozorio: EIZ 8A ZEI. +50 304
#note It looks like he scored this as 49! I think this would have allowed me two extra minutes on my clock as per NASPA rules. Once I catch my opponent having misadded three plays (which I didn't), I am allowed one extra minute, and I think each subsequent mistake gives me another minute! I guess I wasn't ready to be a minute man
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOOTUW 9M WOO +26 288
#note I needed to play OWE here and leave the S open. I know I waffled between WOO and OWE a while. 
>Steve_Ozorio: CG 11I C.G +18 322
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINOTV L2 VINO +17 305
#note missing ENVOI in the same spot :( I used to have a very hard time finding that word. Now I have just an average hard time.
>Steve_Ozorio: ACEKS 14F CAKES +42 364
#note Steve puts the finishing touches on his masterpiece of phonyism*. This was scored as 43 instead of 42! It seems Steve is more likely to misadd when he phoneys. I think that goes for many people, actually. 

Imagine I challenged this off... That would have been amazing. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEIMST 15G MID +49 354
>Steve_Ozorio: ADIP 2J PA.ID +34 398
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIJST M7 J.. +21 375
#note I have no idea what I was attempting to accomplish here. The recorded scores here are 354-407, so I guess I was going for a bingo, but I couldn't hit anything. This seemed like one of those "close my eyes and hope I hit something" moments, but I have some decent plays available here that I overlooked. This was basically just a giveaway. 
>Steve_Ozorio: LTU A5 LUT. +13 411
#note Steve closes the last line (or does he?)
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEFIST 3I FE +13 388
#note This was the right idea, except I needed to play FA instead, setting my S up rather than a mostly useless A.
>Steve_Ozorio: ?EEILNP F1 PEELIN.s +66 477
#note Ugh, challenge.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIRST -  +0 388
>Steve_Ozorio: U N8 ..U +8 485
>Steve_Ozorio:  (AEEIRST) +14 499
#note Somehow, everything was fixed on Steve's end after his final play, and the game ended 391-499. Someone is banking points, and it isn't Steve Ozorio!
