#note I'm like 0-7 lifetime versus Zee.  Soon to be 0-8.  Now just jinxing myself.

#note Ooh.  2J FO(L)LY 58.  Better to take the hot spot though.

#note 13K (K)IEV.  At least I saw this spot.  VENUE at 6B is a bit suicidal.

#note Can't believe I missed BEV(Y).  I think I was setting up my I, which is why.  I don't know why I wasn't more concerned about the other I or the blank, what with him setting up that S(CAN) hook.

#note Attempt at a block.

#note Tunnel vision led me to missing OVER(FINE)#  RIVO and RIVE are options too.  Just figure I should ditch the Ts.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEENOOV 5J DO +19 379
#note Just hoping to not draw the Q.  Apparently (Z)O is 62% to win.  This doesn't rank.  I think I miscounted tiles.
>Ezekiel_Markwei: ?EIRRTT B6 RITTERs +65 428
>Ezekiel_Markwei:  (challenge) +5 433
#note Dammit, I pulled the Q.  I think Zee and I have played 8 games now, and he's bingoed from behind in the last or next to last turn in like 4 of them to win.  Impressive.  Once, he played MIRACLE on a pretty closed board, making a 3 tile overlap.
