#note I hadn't identified O8 as a spot that I had to block so urgently, but quackle wants me to play AHI at O6. After the exchange 2 by Orry I was pretty scared of -INGS bingos.

#note right after I hit my clock I realized I had to play AI with so many Is left. unfortunately, didn't come up with it soon enough.

#note hmm, I guess I missed DOYLIES under time pressure - I remember thinking of it but I thought it might've just been DOYLEY. Still seems like this should be enough to win, but taking a big lead would be preferable...
>Orry_Swift: QU 6B QU.. +33 397
>JD: ?IIMNUZ 7A MI +15 396
#note couldn't come up with a good enough pre-endgame under time pressure. I liked threatening MIZUNA while also saving the Z and the blank, hopefully for a good scoring play, but this just lets him go out-in-two often. the real all-star play is QUINZIE down from the Q, which creates two spots for my M and a good shot at an out, but I didn't come up with that here.
