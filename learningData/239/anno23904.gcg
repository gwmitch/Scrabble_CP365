#note Bob didn't know PLUMBITE.  Obviously, I don't either.  :)  I don't know why I didn't just punt with BUMELIA.  I saw it.  Didn't like it at the time.

>Ryan_Fischer: DENSTUV 14B UNVEST.D +78 316
#note If I'd play for 66, I'd have a bingo again next turn, granted he didn't block.

>Bob_Lipton: EIMNY 3A MEINY +43 401
#note Ow.  Doubt there's much I could do about that.  (Psst.  You coulda found PLUMBITE and not played TUMBLIER!)
>Ryan_Fischer: ACINORX O4 .ANCOR +24 399
#note Nothing wins.  My thought was block ROULADE with RANCOR, set up XI.  Zee mentioned CORN, forcing RULED, and setting up AX in two places.  Champ says (I)RONIC leaves AX to go out.  ANOXIC is another play I saw, but didn't think of the spot for.  Of note: CARN(Y)X#.  RACON is good too, which I thought, but wasn't sure of.  RIX wouldn't help me much though.  RORIC, too.

#note LU(M)A, but he wasn't sure.  Challenged this just to make sure.  Like 99% sure it was good, but if it is I lose.
