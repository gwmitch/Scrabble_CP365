#note Sounded plausible, but should've given it more thought.  Bogus.

#note GI(GO)LO or (GO)GO is better!  I was deliberating on LEGATO, GELATO, and LIGATE, and decided on keeping OT for the safer G placement and better leave.  I thought OT > IT, anyway, (spoiler -- it's NOT) and there are more Is left.  AET is better than them all, so it doesn't matter.

>Ryan_Fischer: BIOOTUV 6E BO +15 188
#note Missing GOBO is pretty bad, as is playing through this rack as long as I did.

#note More of the same.  At least there's some life in this board.
>Supriya_Devnani: AW 9G AW. +27 281
#note Nice fit.
>Ryan_Fischer: IIOQSTV 7C QIS +27 233
#note Played down low to come under with my I.

#note See, like that.
>Supriya_Devnani: EH 2J HE +27 324
>Ryan_Fischer: IINOPRV 3C ROVIN. +22 284
#note Played ROVIN(G) to keep the P to score and for balance.  A lone I is trouble.  And I can hook it later, now that I had to exhaused that lane for scoring.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAHMNRU 2A AMU +13 366
#note Trying to create a distraction at left so I can draw into a 50+ SH play at right.  Only way back in it.  And maybe if she ignores the left, I can score big there too.  Champ wants NAH; 56% to win.  Don't know how.  This is admittedly weak.  Couldn't think of much else to do and was running low on time.
