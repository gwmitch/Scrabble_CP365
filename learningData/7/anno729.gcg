#note This was one of those times when you make a great fishing play, and annoyingly draw the...blank.

#note This was a pretty good play with this rack, but I wonder if APOD (C2,35) might have been better, given my knowledge of Jerry's rack.

#note SOrt of an interesting position. Maybe NALA (C1,21) or ALA instead - I don't care for ALBEDO.

#note Terrible play. I guess I was distracted by the BRRR hook, and totally missed the floating L for CLIENTAL (15G).

#note The 1-tile play of JO would be better, to avoid emptying the bag. This would survive against INTERNE, or even ETERNIZE.

#note This was just weak. I couldn't find the way to stop Jerry's outplay. HINTS (8K,9) is best.
