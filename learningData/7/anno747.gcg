#note WOW!  My revisionist strategy would say that I deliberately passed up the bingo in order to capitalize on what lines she might open with her first play.  yeah.  That's it.

#note  Quackle doesn't like this play very much.  I missed TAILFA(N), but other than that I don't hate it.  Qs second choice is TUFA @ 7I.

#note This is probably the worst play of the game.  QI is a quick 42 (terrible leave), but I almost like H(I)M @ 13G for 32 because of the [LNQT?] leave.  Any comments?

#note I picked FILM over MILK in case I drew the U, I would have two places on my next turn to play off one of the W's along with a U:  WAUK and WUD.  Maybe not the best play, bt that was my reasoning.  Also, I didn't want to do WICK because it needlessly set-up the triple line with a decent bag.
