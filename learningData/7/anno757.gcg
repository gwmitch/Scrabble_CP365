#note This rack might not be quite right...I had it down as AAHPRTT, impossible based on Andy's next play.

#note I didn't like this play much, but there was nothing better.

#note Close call whether to try another play with this junk. Maybe GOO (13G,18) had some merit, but a clean slate seemed best.

#note This was a tough choice. Drawing the blank was great, but there was some necessary pruning work to do for a bingo, and the small matter of a shortage of bingo lines. Quackle likes AA (14E,16), which leaves Row 11 available, but I really hate the CG combination.

#note GAB for 23 sims about 10 points higher, which I find somewhat surprising.  
>Andy: ADELNQS C9 DAN.E +20 283
#note Good play! At first glance the rack suggests fishing, i.e. trade Q, but DANCE (or LANCED) is very likely to meet with an I draw for QIS and decent winning chances. 
>Bing: ?CEGIOO D7 GOO +8 305
#note Not a fun rack, but I missed a slightly better play. OE (D9), counterintuitively wasting the last E for only 7 points, blocks the B10 hotspot, and sets up a spot for -ING or -IC bingos.

#note Really should have exchanged here.

#note Pretty weak. Something like CIG was a possibility, or fishing off the E, going for ACTINIA. Running low on time, I decided to give up on the bingo, block FLINT, and hope for the best. NArIC would have scored 5 more points, but I didn't see it in time.

#note Not sure what Andy was thinking of there, but I was grateful for the gift.
