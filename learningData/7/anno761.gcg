#note I had a feeling I might be missing something here, but thought HO might be best anyway...wrong! I was nowhere near finding the best play of eNOPHIlE (11D). Style points (only) for finding one of the 9's.

#note I couldn't find anything with this rack, either. Only mini-bings were available: kIDNAPEE or oEDIPEAN (12B,61), and APE sims best, but it's still annoying to miss a bingo.
