#note Okcan.
>q: ?EIMPSS H2 IMPaSSE +76 76
#note Eden gets lucky.
>j: DDINOOP G5 POIND +21 21
#note Not optimal. Scores, but blocks up many potential bingo lanes and I lose 3-4 win % compared with Q's reccomendation G2 POOD, which also has a better leave of DIN.
>q: ACDEEHR 4H .REACHED +86 162
#note Yeah. Eden gets lucky again. My luck takes a turn for the better after my next turn though. 
>j: ADNOSXY N3 D.OXY +32 53
#note Now that I'm down by almost a 150 points, I need to get back in the game quickly. I choose N3 D(E)OXY here because it gets rid of the awkward X and Y, scores and keeps a nice ANS. 5J AX is dubious despite the higher score. A leave of YONDS is nearly infertile. Anyway, Q says F9 OXY (which I somehow did not see) and rates D(E)OXY only 4th best but I really don't like F9 OX or 5J AX, which it rates as second and third best respectively.
>q: AILNNVY F7 VAINLY +26 188
#note Eden picks Q's reccomended move on his first non-bingo turn. By now I think you can see that Eden is clearly better than me.

#note Finally. 
>q: AEEIIIN 11E I.IA +8 196
#note Eden finally runs into bad luck. He missed 11F (L)IAI(S)E here - every other option but ILIA and LIAISE is really quite crap cos of leave.

#note QUOIF does not play. Nearly chose O1 QUID before this hit me. I take the lead.

>j: ABEILLO C2 LOBELIA +73 301
#note I get a lucky pickup and Eden's GRECIAN opens for me to catch up.
>q: AEIKLNS N9 ALKINES +78 376
#note Eden pulls another bingo out of the bag.
>j: ADENRTZ 15L ZE.T +69 370
#note I play a cheapo to draw close.
>q: ?EORTUU L4 .OUTUREs +60 436
#note Not the best move because B8 cOUTURE is better, but its enough to firmly seal the game off.
>j: ADFJNOR C13 JAR +40 410
#note Q cannot decide between C13 JAR and C13 JOR. My winning chnces wih either are down to about 6% anyhow.
>q: AMTTTUW B5 WATT +24 460
>j: DFGHNOT D3 FON +31 441
#note I find the best play, giving me an unstoppable out in two, but it's not enough.
