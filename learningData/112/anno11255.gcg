#note Maybe trade CR? Humans are more likely to react defensively to ex. 1. But I dunno, CNRTEI just its too often to risk an ex. 2. They sim about even.

#note I was fairly sure of ENURETICS, but not positive. And I saw KIEV#, but I thought it might be an adjective. So as tempting as 12A KIEVS# was, it just felt too risky for 5-point challenge. Tsk.

#note Ah, didn't see J6 WUS. Collins threes still aren't jumping out at me. This is good points, though.

#note Blugh! This sucks! No need to play off the Q, it's perfectly good on this board. So cash in 14D FAY now and save the Q for next turn. Really bad play! I admit I was distracted by the chance to play WAQF# for the first time.

#note This was a tough call. I really want to kill the meagre bingo lanes here, but I need to keep scoring or risk being outrun. D4 NIX sims better, but I have to infer something really powerful from JEU.
