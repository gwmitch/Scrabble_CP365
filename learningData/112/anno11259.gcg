#note I couldn't help but chuckle at this, because this was the last game in a day chockful of opening bingos. I finished the day with opening bingos in 4 out of 8 of my games... but my opponents opened with bingos in 6 of 8! 62.5% is insane! However, there was only one opening bingo in the 6 games on Sunday, so those numbers tapered off.

#note Gaaah! How did I not challenge this? I knew OBIIT#, and what are the odds there are two weird words like that? I guess I thought they were related. Man, challenges are only 5 points! How did I leave phonies on?

#note I only got 7 blanks all tournament, but got 2 much-needed ones in this game!

#note Daw, chickened out on JEFF#. Several plays are about as good as trading. This one isn't awful, but... many of better. WHIFT#, JEFF. Silly stuff like F(OU)NT and JU(S)T, which I wouldn't do.

#note I'm slow-playing the S because I don't want to put a letter for him to bingo to at 15O. But the pool is weak, so maybe I am being paranoid.
