#note No DECAGRAM.  No 2x2s.  I decide, not too smartly, I need to get a bingo.  GAMMER and GRAMME woulda been fine if not CREAM (best).  Or MACR(AM)E.
>John_Luebkemann: GKOW 6K GOWK +28 87
#note I avoided playing here because of the O(GAM) hook...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACCERR N2 CRAC.l.ER +86 117
#note He blocked R(I)CERCAr.  :/  John also pointed out CERCARIA, which I didn't know, which was blocked, too.  But this... this... THIS... is probably my best play ever.  :)

#note I gotta keep telling myself two Rs isn't THAT bad.  There could be worse things... LIKE two Is!
>John_Luebkemann: AEELSTU 10B ELUATES +68 203
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEIIOR J9 .OIRAI +12 255
#note I figure here, I've got a 40-point lead and the blank.  Good place to lock this thing down.  But this move is all wrong because it creates TOO much volatility, allowing him a chance to bingo too.  The two-ish lines there are fine.  I don't need to make a third.  Just play off OI somewhere and hope to get some consonants for once.  Big mistake!
>John_Luebkemann: EIOU 12H OU.IE +12 215
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEIRV 13B VEAlIER +72 327
#note I don't think there's anything better.  VELARIZE and RELATIVE are too dangerous.
>John_Luebkemann: ELOPSST C1 TOPLESS +75 290
#note Ruhoh!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHNNTU 1A EA.H +33 360
#note Wholly shit!  2J NAUT(C)H 26 (!).  But... NU(T)ANT for 21, or (T)AUTEN for 21, which I saw and chickened out on, does pretty great.  I'd be more likely to play TAUTEN to close it down, make sure he can't get in.  EATH is just bad 'cause the leave is nothing to write home about going to the endgame.
>John_Luebkemann: AZ 12D ZA +45 335
#note Not to mention there THAT, and I had to block RITZ and the like.
>Ryan_Fischer: BNNSTUY H12 ..BY +27 387
#note I "missed" TINNY, but Q static likes ORBY better.  I think it's probably wrong.  Hindsight though.  Champ gets it right here.
>John_Luebkemann: FNNY K11 F.NNY +36 371
>Ryan_Fischer: INNSTTU F12 S.N +17 404
#note Champ is pretty useless here 'cause I have to block that X spot and score to keep him the hellaway!
>John_Luebkemann: DIRT 2A DR.IT +24 395
>Ryan_Fischer: BHINTTU 4A HI.T +22 426
#note This is so bizarre.  I was one tile off, which didn't help.  But, Champ says dumping the H for OHO/PUJAH wins 100%, as does HI or BI.  I guess 'cause they block AXE.  HE and THE win too?  HILT is only 50/50?
>John_Luebkemann: AALX 9C AX +22 417
>Ryan_Fischer: BNTU 10L BU.N +6 432
#note T(E)N to block L(E)A, I guess.  Or UT(E).  I thought I needed to get rid of the B.  He had a lot of time, I had very little.  Consequences of playing someone as speedy as him and needing all the time in the world to even get here.  Then again, if I'd've just closed it down I wouldn't be in this spot.
>John_Luebkemann: AL B9 L.A +13 430
#note I'm just so glad the math was right!  Phew.  The way John's playing this weekend I'm happy to get away with a tie.
