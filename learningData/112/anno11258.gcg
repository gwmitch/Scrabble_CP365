>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EENNOTT 8G NONETTE +66 66
#note I had gotten as far as NONETTI# in my CSW bingo study, so I was trying to guess if this would be good as well. Then I realised I'm an idiot and this is good in TWL. It's not, but this still counts as my first CSW bingo (in a CSW game).
>Adam_Logan: ?AILSXY M4 dYSL.XIA +76 76
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ADIMNR 11F MRIDANg. +70 136
#note Hmm... not great. The TAMARIND overlap was easy to miss, and I have never seen MISANDRY or MANDIRS#, but N9 INARMED should have been obvious.
>Adam_Logan: BHO 10F HOB +37 113
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AACFFMV 10J FA +28 164
#note A bit too paranoid after only a three-tile turnover. L1 FAVA is fine.
>Adam_Logan: INNO 12H NONI +23 136
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACEFGMV L3 CAFE +30 194
#note He blocked my big BIFACE. Anyways, this is also bad. 13G VEG.
>Adam_Logan: EGI H10 ...GIE +27 163
#note PHONY!!!!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BGLMOTV 12C GLOM +24 218
#note OMG I forgot the M hook on MRIDANGA! Didn't really have a play there, but still!
>Adam_Logan: JO 6J JO.. +27 190
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEEPTVZ N2 BEZ +39 257
#note This is risky...
>Adam_Logan: HIT O1 HIT +24 214
#note Whew, got lucky.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EPRSTVV 15D VERV.T +16 273
#note Trade VV looks solid, but I want to start playing defense.
>Adam_Logan: AELORTU 7D TORULAE +77 291

>Adam_Logan: ADELY 8A DELAY +41 332
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEIORUU A1 CURIO. +27 380
#note UU doesn't look so bad with the Q unseen and no spots for it.
>Adam_Logan: AAQ -QAA +0 332
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEINPUU B2 PEN +22 402
#note This play looks ridiculous. But it seems clear that Adam is going to need a miracle bingo to win, so I want to close these lanes. I can deal with the crappy leave, because the unseen pool is conso-heavy. I figure as long as he doesn't bingo, I can pull it out no matter how shitty my rack is. 
>Adam_Logan: ADERSTW 3A ..DWATERS +80 412
#note @#$!#$%!#$%!@#$ HOW DID HE MAKE ME GIVE HIM THE E?!?!?!?! @#$Q@#$!@#$
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIIKRUU 13A KUIA +24 426
#note I have him mistracked, tragically. And there are ways to win, but they require CSW knowledge that I don't have. KIWI, threatening AUGUR and KAURU# can't lose. And KURU threatening ARIKI# does the trick, too. But I just don't know those words, and I have him mistracked, and I don't know the huge plays he has available. After the PEN debacle, this loss really stings.
