>Jim_Burlant: ADFIIJM 8G DIF +14 14
#note Don't know that I like Quackle's suggestion here.   Q wants me to keep dupe I's with 8G JAM.  I don't mind giving up points to make sure I have more balance.
>Lisa_Odom: OY I8 .OY +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: AAGIJMS 10G JA. +13 27
#note Despite all the points available for J6 JISM, with Lisa seemingly close to something, I was more concerned about making it harder for her to hook her probable S on the 2x2 line.  Q gives the slightest of preferences to JISM J6, but this is not far behind at all.  58% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: EO 11G OE +13 23
>Jim_Burlant: ABGIMOS 12D GAMB +30 57
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  BIOG scores 25 and preserves a better leave.  61% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: AEIORST G1 ASTEROI. +61 84
#note The only bingo for Lisa.
>Jim_Burlant: IORRSUZ 1E IZ.R +39 96
#note Despite the 53 points available for 13C ZORIS, this is best - row 1 has to be taken out.  
>Lisa_Odom: CV E11 V.C +16 100
>Jim_Burlant: ORRSTUY D1 STROY +33 129
#note Saw STOURY but wasn't sure enough about it to take a chance on it.  STOURY was the play - it wins 57%, and this wins 52.
>Lisa_Odom: EGN E4 NEG +20 120
>Jim_Burlant: CDLNORU C4 CLOUD +20 149
#note Best.  4G ENDURO, C4 CLOD also worth consideration.  54% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: DEU 8A DU.E +21 141
>Jim_Burlant: ILNOPRT 7F L.P +9 158
#note No real scoring options available.  With TERPINOL blocked by her play of NEG, I fingued I should fish to INTRO and see what happens, since Quackle seems to like INORT as a 5-letter stemp.  This is one of the top 4 choices; Q's 1st choice is for me to dump the rack with 4G ENTOIL.  ENTOIL wins 53%; I'm treading water at 52.
>Lisa_Odom: LL 4G .LL +4 145
>Jim_Burlant: INORSTT 5I INTORTS +66 224
#note Was going to play this at J2, but her play of (E)LL left me no choice but to play with fire and slot the triple.  This is the only bingo, and it wins 81% in a short sim.
>Lisa_Odom: AEMNNST M5 .EMNANTS +64 209
#note Best bingo for Lisa is L4 MONTANES.  Even with this, she's only 23% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ABENOTV O1 VOTE. +27 251
#note Any number of O1 plays available.  This was the right idea with the wrong execution, as I didn't pay enough attention to the tile pool.  Quackle prefers NOVA for that very reason.  63% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: HI N2 HI +22 231
>Jim_Burlant: ABEFNPX 8K AN.EX +39 290
#note Really Quackle?  L12 APEX?  Be serious!  I don't care if it's 46 points to this play's 39.  I'm not going to give her a place to score 45 points.  Q also likes L4 FOB.  I'd make this play again.  73% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: IK 2B KI. +14 245
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEFPU A5 ABE. +7 297
#note I knew when I made this play that Quackle wouldn't like it.  She'd been fishing ever since her bingo, and since she was close to something, I wanted to take away her easiest lijne.  I figured that if she hit something from the A, it would give me something back on row 15; if she hit something from the D, it could be trouble as it gives me nothing back.  Predictably, Quackle doesn't like this at all.  Its preferred choice is fairly defensive in and of itself:  BUMF 7K 22.  Post-mortem, Lisa told me she thought this was fine, as she said that defense was indicated.
>Lisa_Odom: QU 3L QU.. +26 271
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFIPUW 12I WIPE. +20 317
#note Convinced myself that WIFES was phony, so I took no chances.  Q didn't like my last play, but it loves this one:  either this or WIFES is best.  81% to win.
>Lisa_Odom: AW 6K AW. +13 284
>Jim_Burlant: ?DFIRRU 14B FURs +20 337
#note Her play of AWE hurt a LOT, as it blocked my intended play of (Q)U(O)D L3, and it put me in position to blow the game.  I looked at the pool and figured that there was no way on earth she had a balanced rack - with me having landed all the consonants, I was figuring she'd landed a pair of A's or a pair of E's and needed one more turn to fish her way to a bingo.  Between that, and trying to simultaneously block sometihng like SOIGNEE on row 14 and some UN bingo starting at B8,  I figured that by emptying the bag, I'd deprive her of that chance.  Yes, I knew I was violating the basic maxim that you never empty the bag...but I really thought that was the compromise I had to make.  BIG mistake.   Against a random rack this wins 74%; against her actual rack it loses.  Quackle's suggestions here are stupid, as the duck wants me to open up  row 14.  No thanks.  Suggestions?
>Lisa_Odom: ?AEGHIN O7 E.HAlING +69 353
#note <<Jaw Drops In Disbelief>>  Out of that pool she managed to have 7 unique tiles?  Are you kidding me?
