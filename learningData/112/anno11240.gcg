#note Despite leaving myself duplicated R's, this is best - anything that unloads an R gives up too much on the  the scoreboard.
>Lisa_Slankard: DEIOSST I6 O.TSIDES +67 77
>Jim_Burlant: AEEERRR H12 REAR +20 45
#note So of course, the first tile out of the bag is a third R.  Lovely.  Anyway, this is best - given the deficit, I need the volatility created by placing the R at H15 instead of the E.  
>Lisa_Slankard: AGILO 13C GOALI.. +18 95
>Jim_Burlant: DEELNRR 10E REDL.NER +63 108
#note The only bingo - not quite 47% to win.
>Lisa_Slankard: ?EIMORT -?EIMO +0 95
>Jim_Burlant: ?AFIMOU L8 FO.UM +28 136
#note The only bingo I could see in this combination of letters was INFAMOUS, which doesn't play.  There was a playable bingo here:  AURIFORM L8 or L4, both of which score 82.  You have to know the word to play it.  As for non-bingo options, I chose this over FOAM 12A because I wanted to unload the U.  The 82-point bingos win 86%; this choice wins 76.
>Lisa_Slankard: ACERX J2 CAREX +61 156
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIIPS 3G API.rIES +72 208
#note Q wants me to play for 76 at 4H with PARITIES or PIRACIES - I ruled that as needlessly volatile.  However, one option I didn't know was EPISCIA, which plays at M2 for 73.  It would have prevented her next big play.  This wins 70%, but not for long.
>Lisa_Slankard: ENZ L1 ZE.N +46 202
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEFIT 1L .ETA +39 247
#note Statically this is best, but the leave is so beyond bad that I probably should have just balanced the rack.  Instead, given how the day had been going I felt like I couldn't let her milk the Z for another 39 points.  TAFIA wins 63.4%, and this wins 1% less often.
>Lisa_Slankard: ERTY K5 TYRE +36 238
>Jim_Burlant: AAFIINU H1 NI.A +21 268
#note Yuck.  Q wants me to keep duplicated I's with 4D FAUNA.  As wretched as this leave is, I'd rather keep this than 2 I's.  There's only 1 U in the bag - how likely am I to pull it?
>Lisa_Slankard: HN 11K H.N +22 260
>Jim_Burlant: AFIIOUU -FIIOUU +0 268
#note Enough of this crap already!   Either this or exchange 5 keeping AI is the right play.  46% to win.
>Lisa_Slankard: CWY D12 C.WY +32 292
>Jim_Burlant: AGGOTTV N11 GAVOT +26 294
#note  My rationale for this placement was that, since she was probably going to score at 15A, I wanted to be able to counter that by scoring at 15O.   This is best statically, but, presumably due to the unseen J and Q, Q prefers that I play that at 6C for 24. 
>Lisa_Slankard: INV 15A VIN. +30 322
>Jim_Burlant: EEGLPTT 14B PE. +28 322
#note Q wants me to dump the rack with 6B GLEET for 20.  While there's something to be said for turnover with the blank unseen, my big problem with that play is that it burns both my E's with only one unseen.  I'd rather take my chances on staying in the game and not pin all my hopes on a bingo that may not come.  GLEET wins not quite 22%; this wins 20.
>Lisa_Slankard: FIS 15L FI.S +33 355
>Jim_Burlant: EGILLTT F6 T..L. +10 332
#note Possessing the case I, I now see the N at H1 and am trying to fish my way to a game-clinching bingo, either ending in ION (3 O's unseen for that), or ING.  Even a 60-point DELATING airball would be sufficient.  Q wants me to open up lines with 6B and 6C plays like LEGIT or GILT.  No thanks.
>Lisa_Slankard: AQ 6D QA. +12 367
>Jim_Burlant: EGILOTU D4 TO.UE +30 362
#note Was nervous about playing through the Q given the unseen J?, but I didn't think I had much choice.  The 2-ply sim likes this choice.  Apparently, the counter-intuitive M6 OUT is my best bet.  Its advantage is that it doesn't give back any sort of counter play with the J, which is the major limitation that my play of TOQUE has.  Many-ply says OUT wins 29%, and this wins not quite 24.
>Lisa_Slankard: ?DJ 8A JaD. +33 400
>Jim_Burlant: GIKLNOU 5B LO.K +28 390
#note Nothing wins, but this is my best play, setting up my SUING out.
