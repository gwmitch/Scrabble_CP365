#note H11 TEXT wins the sim. That's ballsy, but at least it kills the huge J spot. But there are more S's than J's. I thought J4 TEXTS would be close, but I didn't want to start closing that part of the board.
>Evans_Clinchy: EJSW H12 JEWS +89 264
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEIOQTT J6 QI. +32 178
#note Now I'm changing tune for some reason and picking this over I11 QI. It sims better, but maybe I still should have left it open.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?DGIILR --  -83 264
#note I can't remember whether the R or the T was the blank in this attempt. Will assume T.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CCERTTY 5C C.Y +16 231
#note LECCY# and T(I)CT(O)C are cool! This sims best though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEEORTT 3I CO.ER +22 253
#note Nothing here is very good, but I need to keep a more bingo-prone leave. It was hard to pull the trigger on anything too volatile with the blank on his rack. Maybe 3K DOT? DOTE and RECTO seem too dangerous, but I am down by 90.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AO 4J O.A +12 333
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAELTTV 2L TAV +17 270
#note ORA likely signals another A, but I can't be sure of that. This gamble could really pay off if he doesn't have it.

>Evans_Clinchy: IO J10 IO +11 384
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AABELTT M8 ABETTAL +76 366
#note Completely missed STATABLE, but I think ABETTAL has to be better anyways. I can maybe outrun him if he doesn't bingo, but I need to get really lucky.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EFIILN N4 INFIdEL +79 463
#note Nice. Only bingo.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIOORSV 14J VOI.E +32 398
#note I guess I should have spent more time looking for possible fishes, but it seemed pointless since Evans would outrun anything. I decided to cut my losses, take these points, and hope for a killer play at 15A to finish.
