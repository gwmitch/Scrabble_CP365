#note This is a mindless blunder. I spent ages on this turn, fixated on the N column, but the obvious plays are on row 14. FIENDS or NEIFS or DEFIS there is way way better than this. Horrible tunnel vision. This was a great chance to run away with this game before the headaches started

#note I missed UNBE, which is probably safer. Wanted to unload these N's though, which were getting annoying.

#note No Quackle, TOWIE and TAWIE are silly. I'm getting kind of anxious here, because I should have run away with this game after my two bingos and Sam's bad racks, but I've just been plunking down 10-20 point plays for five turns and he is still in striking distance with great tiles unseen. I think AWEE is fine, by the way, but OWE was probably worth considering.

#note Okay, so now I'm facing a bit of a disaster. Look at all those goodies unseen. And I can't block down the bottom right quadrant without opening up an S hook. COU(N)T stops the Z and J plays on row 14, but then he just hits a bingo or JOIST/ZOIST or something. I decide to just take the points and hope to outrun whatever damage he is about to do.

#note First of all, I just want to point out how silly it is that I am forced to play a pre-endgame which involves blocking ZEMSTVOS. But really, I just have to block up this entire section of the board and pray for a tile which gives me outs, or that Sam winds up getting stuck with something on this tight board. This wins 88% apparently.

#note Sam had under a minute. So he didn't really have a chance to figure out this ridiculous position. It doesn't look like anything wins, but there are a couple of plays which probably win simply because they force me to see and block a specific play. He has to block M9 TAIN. 12K MI does that, and also subtly sets up SEIZOR for a huge play. I can and must block that play with MINT. Anything else and I lose to SEIZOR. Sam could also try 12K WIS, following that up with 10L TOZE. I have to block with (DI)NT, or else Sam scores too much off of TOZE. I can still win with TAXES and JA, but only by a couple points and only if I spot that sequence in the minute I have left (I likely just get greedy and slap down TA, TAXES). Neither of these plays win, but considering his opponent has weak Collins vision and is low on time, they probably both work. Tricky!
