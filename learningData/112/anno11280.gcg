>Wayne_Clifford: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHILOS G8 .I +12 12
#note I mostly just did this to make his scoring options limited without an S.
>Wayne_Clifford: DEMO F9 MODE +13 35
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHLOOS E11 OHO +23 35
#note I kinda got pissed that I saw HALO for 27 after I hit the clock, but OHO does sim better. So I guess the better leave is worth the slight cut in points.
>Wayne_Clifford: IIUUUU -IIUUUU +0 35
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELRSU E5 LAURA +15 50
#note Ouch. I mean I know the word, but I'm just so bad at anagramming these vowel bingos, and the spot is kinda tricky to boot.
>Wayne_Clifford: ERW 12D W..RE +24 59
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIPRSX 13G EXPIRES +102 152
#note Massive fluke. I would have dumped the X at the LAURA spot if I had a blank here, though.
>Wayne_Clifford: ERV H11 V..ER +45 104
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFKNOY 12J KAF +38 190
#note I thought keeping the Y wasn't so bad because I might get to cash it at the LAURA spot, that's why I didn't play KAYO.
>Wayne_Clifford: BCO F4 COB +25 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DNORUY 14L YOD +25 215
#note I got really stuck here. I saw the bingo ROUNDlY, but that's all. There's only 1 other bingo. YOU in the same spot sims a little better.
>Wayne_Clifford: GN K10 GN.. +10 139
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCNRRU 7H BUR +10 225
#note This gave me a few hooks to work with so I liked it, and with YOD hanging around I probably needed another hook for insurance. Sim says BRUC(I)N is the play, I didn't know that one, although BRU(I)N is right behind. I still feltl better with another hookable lane.
>Wayne_Clifford: DDEU 8A UDDE. +24 163
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACINRT O9 NARCIsT +90 315
#note I need to get more fluky games like this.
>Wayne_Clifford: N 10N N. +4 167
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIIST 15F EE.IE +5 320
#note I almost just exchanged instead, but I decided that taking 5 points and killing this TWS bingo spot was acceptable with the lead I have.
>Wayne_Clifford: AGILNOS B5 LOA.INGS +64 231
>Matthew_Larocque: INSSTVW -  +0 320
#note Yeah I actually challenged when I have no reason to. It sure isn't the first time. I thought he might have been taking advantage of being behind to make something up. The sad part is I've probably played this word before on ISC or something, and it just never stuck.
>Wayne_Clifford: JOY K5 JOY +35 266
>Matthew_Larocque: INSSTVW J6 W.IT +28 348
#note On the plus side, he gave me a good play that doesn't force me to use my S.
>Wayne_Clifford: MPU A12 UMP +11 277
#note Wow, he's really not holding back anymore.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENSSTV A1 STAVE +38 386
#note I completely played this wrong. Very very fail of me. For some inexplicable reason I couldn't even come up with SAVE at the bottom. It's horrible. I saw stuff like SENT or SANE and decided to chance playing this and hopefully draw a nice play for the bottom next turn. I was a little worried he might destroy this spot with something like GLOZE or FEAZE. He probably had the blank and was just going to do (UMP)s until I opened things up with STAVE. With how things worked out I'm not sure how much it would have differed. But, both sim and champ apparently like the STAVE play so maybe I didn't fail as bad as I thought.
>Wayne_Clifford: F F14 F. +13 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENSTZ M9 ZA +24 410
#note Aw, I missed ZENA(N)A. That's too cool. At least I ended up with a ridiculous draw at the end.
>Wayne_Clifford: N 6J ..N +6 296
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOSTT L4 TO. +15 425
#note I wanted to used the UMP spot, but now there's only 3 in the bag and I don't want him to bingo out on me. So I played this to keep a nice leave and leave 1 in the bag. I did make the right choice after what happens.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AEHILT 1A .HALIEsT +83 379
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINST 2H INGESTA +76 501
>Matthew_Larocque:  (L) +2 503
#note Lol, so my STAVE play allowed him to bingo, but it also gave me a bingo, and that stupid UMP spot just got ignored. - 10 timer.
