>Matthew_Larocque: FHILLMW 8E FILM +18 18
#note WHIM scores more, but I don't mind keeping the WH combo because it's usually easy to score points with.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ADEZ E8 .AZED +36 36
>Matthew_Larocque: BEHILOW D11 BELOW +38 56
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AMP C12 PAM +28 64
#note I remember he spent a really long time here. I'm guessing he left himself a really bad leave or something.
>Matthew_Larocque: GHINOSX I7 XI +27 83
#note The simulation actually likes dumping the X for 9 points. I suppose there's a pretty high chance of a bingo with words like SHOEING HOUSING HOSTING SHORING and whatever else there may be. I've been trying to lean away from constant fishing though in favour of consistent scoring and hopefully get some bingos along the way.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEIIIJO -AIIIJO +0 64
#note He played JIAO B9 but muttered that it was insane. I'm guessing he had 6 vowels.
>Matthew_Larocque: GHNNOST 9C GN.T +9 92
#note I really couldn't find anything good, but I also didn't want to exchange. I hate having to do so after my opponent does, to lose any kind of edge I might have gotten. Simulation is pretty clustered between all kinds of plays, but the top choices are (M)ONTH, (MO)NTH and (FILMI)NG. I guess I shouldn't be afraid to use up the O, because there's a lot of vowels left. I've been kind of ignoring -ING lately too, because it just never wants to work out for me.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ADEK 15D .AKED +39 103
>Matthew_Larocque: AHJNOOS 10B JO +28 120
#note I wasn't sure if FILMI took an S, and this play seemed good enough that I shouldn't worry about it. Even with another O on my rack, JO(MO)N seems a little too high risk.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IQ J6 QI +40 143
#note Damn.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNOOS 14H OOH +17 137
#note This seemed so awful at the time, but it sims almost as good as the top play of HOE 8A. I think I might have just forgot about being able to play at 8A.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ETY 13H TYE +28 171
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHNSY 12J HEY +27 164
#note I was really disappointed that he blocked my planned move of HYENAS for 53. :/
Again this seemed like a crappy play but there really isn't anything outstanding I missed, although sim does like YEAH in the same place.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AGPRS M9 GRASP +30 201
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AGPRS --  -30 171
#note I held this and was pretty sure HEYS was nonsense.  I'm thinking it's good in the other book though - I believe I played HEYED  during an ISC game using the SOWPODS dictionary.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELNSU F6 DU.. +9 173
#note Wow, UN(FAZED). Whiffed AU(XI)N. Also whiffed SUNDAE 15J. SULDAN plays there as well, I didn't know that word. This sims pretty bad, probably because it scores unnecessarily badly.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AGPRS K7 SPARG. +28 199
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEILNS 8K .LACE +30 203
#note Right idea but I can play something better like (P)ANIC, and two words I didn't know, PICAL and PLICA.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CRTTU O4 CUTT.R +11 210
>Matthew_Larocque: INRRSSS 15J SIR +14 217
#note Here's where I truly miss out on putting the game away. I ponder wether SCUTTER is a word, but I have absolutely no idea, no good feelings, nothing. It's a shot in the dark and I can't really afford to fall behind if it's bad. So I end up dinking away my esses and I'm unable to build a bingo for that prime opening. Also, (SPARGE)RS. Yeah, I didn't even know if SPARGE was good when he played it.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DGLN M6 GL.ND +9 219
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRSS 9H ES +18 235
#note The top simming plays keep two esses which doesn't seem right. It always wants to get rid of one. I could also do ASE(A) in this spot, perhaps better solely because there's 2 blanks unseen.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AERW 11D ..WARE +11 230
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENORS F13 OA. +9 244
#note Or AA B12, says the sim. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AENV 6B VANE. +17 247
#note I did hold this, just because I always get it confused with *VASED.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRSU 6M .U. +6 250
#note Now that I actually bother to check, a lot of the ARSINE bingos I might draw here don't end in S. Assuming I actually try SCUTTER.  I was running out of time, so I just waited for him to open something for me - I was thinking he must have had at least one blank by now.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BFI 5C FIB +31 278
#note That play hurt, and I can't do crap if I don't get an O.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINRS D4 A.. +6 256
#note Except I still decide to pass on trying SCUTTER, and figure this is almost impossible to completely block unless he has something like REV. Still, I got pretty lucky here with that bingo lane screaming at me and all.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: TTU 3B TUT +10 288
#note Maybe the other direction for 7 points is more defensive? Maybe not, but it didn't matter anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EINNRS 2B INSNaRE +73 329
#note Yes, I didn't play INSANER for more points. I was over on time and this won the game regardless so I just slapped it down.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EINOOOR 1F NOO +18 306
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIIV 4K cIVI. +18 347
#note SCUTTER strikes again.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIOR 13L ORE +11 317
#note He forget about 8A too I guess.
>Matthew_Larocque: E 10M .E +5 352
#note Hey I found the best spot. That like, never happens.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (I) +2 354
#note Lol I lost 30 timer points. I'm so bad with the timer. I think my average tournament score could easily be over 390 if I wasn't so slow.
