#note Was not sure what to do...there wasn't a bingo in the rack.  I thought to keep the board open and get rid of the l and g.

#note Stared at this rack for a long time.  Glad I found this because I had a feeling I'd be in for a long game otherwise.

>Brett: EINNRSU --  -12 225
#note This was dumb.   Sometimes I need to just look at the board when I put my letters down.  I did this at another tourney, transposing letters.  ERNE!
>dave: HILMSSU K3 D.W. +16 210
>Brett: EINNRSU 14I UNRISEN +81 306
#note Normally one gets punished for a mistake.  I  got to look at the previous rack again as spotted UNRISEN.  I had SUNNIER but nowhere to go with it.  A t could have gotten me runniest.  I need to work with how when to and when not to give up on a rack.  
>dave: ADILMSS 15C DISMALS +85 295
#note I think he hoped to draw a challenge from this. A few months ago I may have done so but I happened to see this before watching a high rated game.  dismal - a track of swampy land

#note Quackle says for me to play bis, fishing off the S at N8.  I'm trying to go through the bag. The board is really closed.  Anything's possible sometimes I guess.
