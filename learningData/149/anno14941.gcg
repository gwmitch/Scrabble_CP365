#note Missed E3 FEYER, a very nice play. FRATER has other advantages - after FEYER a defensive DURRA play would put me in a bind sometimes. Still, definitely a mistake.
>Terry: GJU B6 JUG. +28 197
>Will: CEMNORT 3L MOC +18 163
#note Missing the E8 scoring spot (all game long, in fact). C1 NOM looks okay, but I was worried about the board continuing to shut down.

#note Hoping for that last I for IONIZE. Keeping the last E for POISE also seemed worthwhile, and generally vowels are scarce now. But HADE is 10 more. Tough call.
>Terry: AX 14E AX +52 351
>Will: EINSTVZ O1 ZEST +50 358
#note A huge miss of E8 ZITI now. I thought about VEST over ZEST as well - the 3I ZA spot is still there, but the Es for IONIZE are gone.

>Will: ?BIIMNV 15A VIMeN +30 388
#note I thought emptying the bag/taking this lead would be the best way to go here, but I still lose to good enough outs-in-two. CP comes up with 10M BE and I have to admit I didn't even consider going for bingos while also getting the advantages of not emptying the bag. With AALN available the chances are pretty good of playing at 2G (MINIVAN, VIMINAL)
