#note PUG, GAUGE, GANGUE, or UNPEG? I chose this because I had a G in reserve for UNPEGGED but of all the leaves AG is the most likely to go sour fast.

#note Other plays I considered: B8 AD, 2I AD, B8 ADZ. The 2J scoring spot was terrifying, but I eventually decided the best way to go here was to roll the dice and hope Larry can't crush me there. B8 AD lets me counter his plays there with a 60 pointer of my own, but then what? Also if he blocks it I'm stuck with AISZ? on a very troublesome board for bingoing.
