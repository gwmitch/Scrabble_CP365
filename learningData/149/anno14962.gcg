>Rafi: AAGINNR 8H AN +4 4
>Cesar_: AEGINRU I7 G.U +7 7
#note obviously, just NU/UN are better by a huge margin. i think what i was seeking with this was to make it easier for me to bingo back (making his bingo go vertically down hitting AN if he doesn't have an S), but notice that that doesn't make sense, so please just ignore my explanation. i will still randomly make brainfart moves all the time. (-15.5)
>Rafi: AGIINRU 8H ..URIA +7 11
#note This was a very tough move for me... I thought about UNAI, and exch. UI as well. I can't really stop bingos here if Cesar has an S which I suspected. I think trading might be best, and if Cesar bingos then I'll have at least a couple tiles for possible 8s. 
>Cesar_: ADEINRY 7B READYIN. +67 74
#note cesar: luckbox
>Rafi: BDFGINS 6D FIB +35 46
>Cesar_: BEELORS L4 EROS.BLE +70 144
#note earlobes is better, luckbox! yep, missed it. or more like stopped looking for more than a couple seconds since i didn't see it right away. one day i will be good. (-4) instead, i'm setting up two double-doubles.
>Rafi: ADGNORS N2 DRAGONS +79 125
>Cesar_: ACDHILW K3 CHAW +38 182
#note good, but 5E HAW is better. it actually has a higher bingo % too by a tiny bit. (-3)
>Rafi: CHOORUY K11 YOUR +24 149
#note Considered YUCH, HOY, and HOY parallel to DRAGONS before seeing and deciding on YOUR. As soon as I hit my clock though I realized YOU was the play!
>Cesar_: DEEILMR 8A MELD +40 222
#note the leave is better than DEEM's.
>Rafi: ACEHOTW 14J W.OTH +38 187
#note WATCHE(YE) is super cool! Thought about HAW, but not too many A's left so I thought I could score well with ACE if I didn't bingo next turn. WROTE, WROTH, and HAW are all simming about the same.
>Cesar_: EILMORX 15L MOIL +41 263
#note i should be able to spot moxie but either way i'm in good shape if i keep the X for next turn.  (-2.5)
>Rafi: ACEGLOT 5E GAT +26 213
#note I need the Z for CLOZE for 80! CELO is also bingoable, so I have a few comeback possibilities up my sleeve. cesar: good setup with the Z out. 
>Cesar_: ?EEIRSX O3 EX +36 299
#note this is better than every bingo! well, except prexies; by win% it's a very small difference though.
>Rafi: ACELOOT 15H COO +20 233
#note I hate blocking this lane. Maybe LOCATE for 9 extra points and turnover for the blanks? COO up top is an option too. Wishing I had another E for (RE)LOCATEE. TOO in the top right is winning the sim.
>Cesar_: ?EINRSU A8 .oNSIEUR +80 379
>Rafi: ?ADEILT B1 TrAILE..D +74 307
#note Highest scoring bingo, and gives me some slim hope with multiple bingo lanes open. I need to draw FEEZE or something. I remembered this word because of the section in Word Freak where Marlon was studying extensions such as TRAILERABLE... if TRAILERABLE is a word then TRAILER has to be a verb. Cesar: now that's a sick play
>Cesar_: AFJPPTV 3A J.VA +28 407
#note nothing better. i hate keeping the 3-3 open though, an there's so many other lanes, but i'm stll quite likely to win. as long as he doesn't have stotinki.
>Rafi: AEEEINT 10L .EE +5 312
#note I have no idea. I was looking for ways that I could hit a triple triple but Cesar will almost surely block. I was just hoping to cut spread at this point... doubt I can win this game. Maybe I can draw into a SATINE bingo and get Cesar in Q trouble?
>Cesar_: EFIPPTV H2 FIVE +19 426
>Rafi: AEIKNQT 3G Q. +21 333
#note Didn't write down this rack, although this is probably right. Missed QAT! Lol. I was down to under a minute after thinking forever on LEE.
>Cesar_: NOPPSTZ D2 Z.P +28 454
>Rafi: AEEIKNT 11A .KEANE +20 353
#note Just throwing down words at this point to avoid time penalty.
>Cesar_: INOPSTT 10D TOPIS +27 481
#note unstop (-1). including the brainfart on the first move, this is a total of 26 equity lost, but i'm being too hard on myself for that first move. it really isn't something i should be doing though. :P
>Rafi: IT 2D .IT +14 367
