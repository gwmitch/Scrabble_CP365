>Avery_Mojica: ADIIOSS 8D OIDIA +14 14
#note Carolyn was probably my favorite opponent of the tournament.
>Carolyn_Easter: AGRTU E6 GU.TAR +14 14
#note Scored as 16. oops
>Avery_Mojica: ?BESSUZ 12B SUBSiZE +94 108
#note SUBSIZE*
>Carolyn_Easter: DELV I9 VELD +31 45
#note SUBSIZED*
>Avery_Mojica: AAERSWY F8 .AW +30 138
#note DAY > DAW by about 5 points. Not sure why, I guess the W is better than the Y. 
>Carolyn_Easter: COP 13A COP +24 69
>Avery_Mojica: AENORSY 14B YON +29 167
>Carolyn_Easter: ANT 15A TAN +22 91
#note 13G ANT
>Avery_Mojica: ADEGNRS G7 G.D +15 182
#note I saw DERANGES, but she had been telling me about how awful her racks were, and based on her plays and body language, she wasn't going anywhere. I figured I could keep the board closed.
>Carolyn_Easter: IIIII -IIIII +0 91
#note I think this is actually what she exchanged, too.
>Avery_Mojica: AEFINRS J10 FA +28 210
>Carolyn_Easter: UX K11 XU +38 129
>Avery_Mojica: EIJLNRS -JL +0 210
#note I can exchange as needed, she isn't going anywhere. 
>Carolyn_Easter: IIIII -IIIII +0 129
#note lol
>Avery_Mojica: EIINRRS 6C RI. +4 214
#note Funny, this is near the top. Only better choice is RIGID, which I didn't think of.
>Carolyn_Easter: RTY L12 TRY +16 145
>Avery_Mojica: ?EIINRS 14L .IN +12 226
#note In hindsight, ZIN may have been better considering that I have lots of available hooks for myself. I didn't want to open up the board for only 61 points.
>Carolyn_Easter: EO 15N OE +8 153
#note 13L ROE
>Avery_Mojica: ?CEEIRS B2 CERItES +70 296
#note O8 EXERCISE is a miss. 
>Carolyn_Easter: EEW A7 WEE +29 182
#note Scored as 26. 
>Avery_Mojica: ADEEHKT H12 .KED +27 323
#note At this point she said "Blow this shit wide open for me" and I basically lost all interest in playing the best game I could. As long as I could keep it closed and score, I was fine. Yet this is best.
>Carolyn_Easter: AHL 3A H.AL +14 196
>Avery_Mojica: AEHIORT 4B .HO +21 344
#note 13L RHO is better, but this is more defensive.
>Carolyn_Easter: IO 13N OI +5 201
>Avery_Mojica: AEFIRTV 14F VE. +14 358
#note Q says fish off the F, but where am I supposed to bingo regardless? VIE is better than VEE, though I thought of both of them.
>Carolyn_Easter: Q O12 Q. +21 222
>Avery_Mojica: AEFIJRT -FJ +0 358
#note I can exchange all I need to and not worry. I didn't even see the JUPON spot at 11C. 
>Carolyn_Easter: EM M11 ME +7 229
>Avery_Mojica: AEINPRT 14F ...P +9 367
>Carolyn_Easter: EGT 10L TEG +13 242
>Avery_Mojica: AEILNRT N3 ALERTIN. +61 428
#note Not good defensively, but it pays off.
>Carolyn_Easter: FI O7 IF +32 274
#note First, I distract her here.
>Avery_Mojica: AABIJOT O1 JABOT +54 482
#note Then I turn into the luckiest player ever and draw this. (Totally not planned out, but it worked.)
>Carolyn_Easter: LMNNRSU M1 MUS +20 294
>Avery_Mojica: AI K14 AI +9 491
#note There was an O in the bag that went unnoticed by both of us. Final score 499-299.
