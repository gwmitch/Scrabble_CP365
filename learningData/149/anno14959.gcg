#note huh. i didn't consider SIZY keeping EST. (-1.5)

>JD: AEFIINR E4 IF +20 133
#note IF looks a little lazy even on an open board, should take the points for FRIAR

>JD: AEEGHRY C8 .HEERY +30 206
#note the board is quite closed but GEY at 2A leaves AEHR which bingoes 20% of the time and just scores a lot more in general.
>Zar: CEILNOX G5 XI +26 223
#note really, EXONIC? it's aggressive, CLONE isn't gonna do much on this board. interesting move.
>JD: AAGGINT 8L .AGA +15 221
#note an error, I forgot RAGG was good. yikes.
>Zar: CEKLNOR D1 CO.K +38 261
>JD: BEGIINT B13 BIG +19 240
>Zar: ELLLNOR 15A O.LER +21 282
#note the best play here is D13 ELL. it is important for me to keep a workable leave and try to bingo or keep scoring with good leaves as jesse is opening the board. (-2.5)
>JD: BEFIINT 14D BEFIT +24 264
#note after EF it seems like I will have a hard time cleaning up my rack. quackle suggests RIB to fish again but I think I prefer this play against a human opponent.
>Zar: LLNTUUV H12 TU.U +15 297
#note jesse already knew this wasn't a good play without seeing the rest of my rack; this is actually about as good as exchanging the whole rack. the obvious play here is 13G LUV, which is still barely positive by equity. pretty crappy luck these past couple of turns, but that's when i need to be at my sharpest and do the best i can. i think LUV has to be best despite giving up a lot of points mainly because everything else just really sucks. (-5.5)
>JD: DEINNOT O8 .NTINODE +80 344
>Zar: AILLNOV 13G L.V +14 311
#note my intuition was completely wrong; ANVIL + the G bingoes much more often. (-6) N13 LO also sims better because it gives up fewer points.
>JD: ADELMUW N11 MULED +33 377
#note keeping the W does well here with the cheap spot at B10 available. ULEMA sims just as well.
>Zar: AILNOOS 9B O. +5 316
#note i have NO idea what to do here. playing just one tile, though, is wrong. maybe COO and pray i draw a bingo from the W? OOH? i think there's no way to win this against a human, unless i'm missing something.
>JD: ACDETTW B9 .W +26 403
#note he can still hit up top, but thankfully I don't have to empty the bag. quackle claims I win 100%.
>Zar: AEILNOS 10I O. +5 321
#note yeah i lost.
>JD: ACDERTT A10 ARC +14 417
#note right idea, DATO also blocks salines/silanes and is 4 better
>Zar: AEILNSS M2 LIENS +25 346
#note low on time
>JD: DETT H7 D.ET +11 428
#note TEED
