#note Bah, TRIPEDAL a smidge better.

#note BETH or PITH seemed like a tossup.

#note A big mistake, keeping IIS here is bad with that many vowels to come. Quackle loves the fishes here.
>Jan: IKNNORS 12C .INKORNS +76 321
#note Also hanging an E after DART and ROM might have been bad too

#note First blown game. N5 DIVULSE wins seemingly every time. I spent 10 minutes looking and just couldn't come up with it. Also just playing 2E FLU is probably smarter than rolling the dice with ELUSIVE with this extremely bingo-ey pool.
