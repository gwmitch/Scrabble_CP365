#note Thought about FAENA and FAENAS/YOUS... not sure if I considered FA. AEENS is a step up from AEES but I'm not sure if it's worth sacrificing 5. This also isn't the most bingo friendly board so sacrificing to go for a bingo might not be the best idea. Quackle rates them almost even.

#note HAZE was my other choice, but I like the SHE combo and was (for some reason) worried about two tile plays on the triple. ZONAE wins the sim by a tad.

#note Bad play. I went for the points but AAIR is a pretty poor leave with 5 I's unseen. HA(J)I looks pretty strong (and simultaneously scary) here... AEHR is a strong leave and I get rid of my I. Maybe just HAJ to keep it more closed? The leave is much less stable but the board position is more favorable. There is only one S unseen though... not necessarily a bad thing to open the lane because I might incude an overreaction to the spot.

#note Another poor play. AIRBOA(T) looks pretty good here but I didn't see it. AR(I)O(S)I is cool, and BOA looks better too. ABIOO is horrible! Yuck.

#note I guess I don't HAVE to play in that spot... I'm giving up a lot back. I thought this was better than OAF though, because it restricts comebacks some. Quackle suggests BOOM in the top left and FAI(R) as alternatives.

#note Considered POO in that spot to set up my case E, although I'm not setting it up for much. Glad I spotted POORI, which is the clear best play.

#note (S)NAKE! Made this play pretty quickly to put on the time pressure... I thought ABEV would fare well based on the pool. SNAKE is interesting... lots of scary endgame scenarios it seems, but if I draw the blank or two vowels I think I should be ok. Didn't consider anything other than GINK.
