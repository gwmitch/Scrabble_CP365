>Matthew_Larocque: AENOSTW K4 WOE +27 65
#note Had a feeling just WO or (W)OW was better, the E makes the leave so much stronger.

>Matthew_Larocque: AINNRST D4 RANTIN.S +70 135
#note I try to make up for that error with a phony.
>Huguette_Settle: DLR 5C L.RD +10 75
#note Huguette doesn't even blink at it.
>Matthew_Larocque: AACIRST 6B CA. +13 148
#note This is more than obvious, but it also could be akward to try and block.
>Huguette_Settle: AADLS A6 SALAD +24 99
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIRST F10 .I +2 150
#note Pick a fish, any fish. Is it worth it to gain 6 extra points playing off AI? 
>Huguette_Settle: DHI B6 .HID +20 119
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIRST L6 SERIATE +72 222
#note In a stunningly bad brain lapse, after playing off 1 tile I managed to overdraw. I had 2 tiles facedown. It was so ridiculous, Huguette didn't even know how to deal with it and she's a director! I believe the rule is the amount overdrawn +2, except I only had two tiles that were unseen and unmixed. It gets even more weird. I jokingly say "Ok, where's that blank?", and when she turns over both tiles there WAS a blank! Lucky for me I had the SATIRE stem to bail me out.
>Huguette_Settle: ?LORSUY 12G YOURS.Lf +61 180
#note Unlucky for me, she gets the blank that I could have possibly gained.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIKNP E9 A.K +30 252
#note As I made this play I kinda knew it wasn't optimal, although it did score well and didn't offer anything in return. L1 plays score better and have better leaves at the expense of her getting an easy 25-30. 13B PINKIE seems to be the standout here, getting more turnover.
>Huguette_Settle: ACTT 8K T.ACT +21 201
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIINPU J10 PU.I +12 264
#note Giving me the N hook, although I'll be lucky if IIEN turns into anything noteworthy. Missed EU(R)IPI which looks tempting despite the obvious disaster potential.
>Huguette_Settle: MNOY H11 M.ONY +30 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIINO O2 IODINa.E +60 324
#note Disappointed that I very recently checked all the VOICE extensions, and made use of DEVOICED and REVOICED in two subsequent tournament games - only to miss INvOI(C)ED here. Bingos like those ones are much easier when the awkward letter isn't the blank. IDONEIt(Y) is a completely new word to me.
>Huguette_Settle: EEJT L1 JETE +48 279
#note Now she pounds that hotspot and my bingo blocked any counterplays. I mean, I'm glad that I recognize the merits of defense, but I used to be almost fearless making plays that offered anything in return.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGIOVZ 14F ZI.G +34 358
#note I actually rejected FAZI(N)G because the extra 5 points didn't seem worth it for a free TWS. My defensive thinking coming into play again - when I was newer, I would have played FAZI(N)G and not given a crap.
>Huguette_Settle: AENV N1 VANE +23 302
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGIOPV 15C VIGA +20 378
#note Wasn't really sure what to do here. If the Q is in the bag, I sure as hell won't be playing it. VIGA is winning the sim, though.
>Huguette_Settle: BEEORTU C13 RE. +12 314
>Matthew_Larocque: FOPQ B12 FOP +26 404
#note Of course, now I'm pissed, and I'm telling myself I should have just passed. The problem with passing is, if she sees BREE(ZING) then I'm in big trouble. She'll also have multiple Q dumps including the huge QUO(D). I blindly play FOP when OP is obviously much better to keep the F for 7L 18.
>Huguette_Settle: BEOTU 10A .E +18 332
#note Thankfully my lead is too big for her to catch me.
>Matthew_Larocque: Q -  +0 404
>Huguette_Settle: BOTU M10 BO.T +18 350
#note (C)OB is a little better, to play off the U and T separately.
>Matthew_Larocque: Q -  +0 404
>Huguette_Settle: U 6N U. +4 354
>Huguette_Settle:  (Q) +20 374
#note I went down to 394. Another phony bingo keeps me alive.
