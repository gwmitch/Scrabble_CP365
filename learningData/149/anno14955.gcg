#note didn't like TORC, which sims a little better, but quackle's favorite is WITS at 10F, with lots of goodies in the bag...I think I like WITS now even though I hate being the first person to blow up my rack in a tie game. the board is closed enough to make it a good decision though.

#note with the second-to-last S in hand quackle actually recommends playing AA instead of AE to create a bingo lane, upping my bingo percentage by 15% next turn.

#note I'm capable of finding basenji, just didn't look for it here. definitely worth it.
>Gerry_Greenside: OOP C4 POO +14 153
>JD: ABDENQS 12K Q..D +14 241
#note should save the D for QAID but quackle says the much more immediate threat is column D, I agree. big error.

#note ruh roh
>JD: ABBHPST B13 TH. +24 299
#note having the case S is a huge deal for me...I can wait until I draw a huge play there and it's very hard to block. quackle likes my move - slow down the game and score my way back into the game. an alternative that sims just as well is EBB but I'm not sure how much my improved leave will help me.

#note quackle says I only have a 50% shot at winning, but I have to cash this play at some point anyway, and gerry might not play the endgame right.
>Gerry_Greenside: GIINTUU 15M GI. +6 359
>JD: DEIRRR H10 .RR +4 369
#note not exactly sure if quackle's suggestion of ER at H10 is correct - the sequence involves sticking him with the I and the U, but he may be able to avoid it by playing well. it seems academic anyway.
>Gerry_Greenside: INTUU 4C ....NT +9 368
>JD: DEIR 13J DI.. +16 385
#note bad play because it gives back dui, AE/NE for 4 actually sticks him with the I and I can play DIET whenever I want later.
