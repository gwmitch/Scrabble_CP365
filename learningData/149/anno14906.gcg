>Winter: CEJLRRW 8F CREW +18 18
#note Not sure why I didn't see this. Maybe it's because I'm blind to ethinicity. I don't see people as Black, White, Mexican, Jewish, Catholic, Female, etc, etc.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: FHITY F5 FIT.HY +27 27
#note Hurm. I've actually been through this list, of 6s that end in Y, at least twice, maybe three times, but it's a long list, hard to learn, and this one just didn't stick out. Also, Kenji DOES phoney.
>Winter: EJLLNOR -  +0 18
#note Coulda gone either way. I could just as easily have lost by letting a phoney go.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: GOO E4 GOO +20 47
>Winter: EJLLNOR 10B JOLL. +31 49
#note Appropriate, since my ultimate goal is to be jolly no matter how long and thick the serrated cock that Kenji thrusts into my unwelcoming orifice.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEIL B10 .AILED +28 75
#note Verily, I refuse to be jailed by negative emotion.
>Winter: AEINPRS J2 PANIERS +77 126
#note A rare occurence, my bingoing first against the Kenj.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: GIINNR 4H RI.NING +18 93
#note No idea.
>Winter: EOOOPTZ I3 Z.P +49 175
#note Had to think about this one. Saw POZOLE and PLOTZ, but decided to go for the points. Quackle hates it.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEHINRT C3 ANTIHER. +82 175
#note Hey, isn't Kenji kind of an antihero in the Scrabble scene?
>Winter: EGMOOOT B6 MOO +28 203
#note Mooooooo. Like a cow, I will be blissful.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CIO 15A O.IC +30 205
>Winter: DDEEGOT A7 ODD +33 236
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?ENNSUY H8 .NNUYEeS +92 297
#note No idea, and my next play brings me within 30, with a lot of ammo still in the bag. 
>Winter: DEEGMTU N2 DE.UM +30 266
#note Probably played too quickly. I'd seen the GNU possibility earlier but forgot it.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAEERTU O6 AUREATE +78 375
#note This is the real test, and I think I passed, by maintaining my composure.
>Winter: ?EEGOTT D1 TOTE +20 286
#note I hate to burn two vowels, and risk drawing the Q, but Kenji will almost certainly try to block the good lines, and I need to score a lot with a bingo to catch up.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AABE 1A ABA.E +21 396
#note Abate, something Kenji's scoring almost never does.
>Winter: ?BEGQRS 12A Q. +21 307
#note The Q, the last tile I needed, but when there are millions of people around the globe who need clean water, this is minor.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IK N10 KI +34 430
#note Ah, well. That's the game. Just ignore it and make the best play.
>Winter: ?BEGRSU G2 BUG +17 324
#note Saw aUB(E)RGES, but given what was in the bag, I hated that play. Didn't see BROGUES. Probably would have played that, for 80.

But actually, G(N)U was the play! Silly me.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AFLW M11 FLAW +26 456
>Winter: ?AEIRSV 15F mI.AVERS +72 396
#note At least I found the best play.
>Winter:  (ESTVX) +30 426
