#note Ottawa matchplay tourney, Round 4 Game 2.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEEEHOS 7F BEE +15 15
#note Liked it better than THEBE, which seemed to give back easy parallels, but I didn't spend enough time considering OBEAH, which doesn't give much back. Still prefer this though
>John_Stardom: EEGOP E8 .POGEE +18 30
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEHORRS D12 HOB +28 43
#note I hated this, but I also hated F10 HO because he just does an easy play on row 12. But HO sims a point or two ahead of this.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DDELNNS 12K LEND +19 301
#note The bag is super vowel lite, so floating an E with DINDLE looked awful. But I didn't know DINNED, which doesn't give up the dangerous N10 vertical play.
