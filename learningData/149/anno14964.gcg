#note i agonized over this move for a while. ON 15A seems strong, but it didn't seem to me to accomplish that much. i felt like i would need at least one of the Ss to win the game, even though i'm in pretty good shape, there's ways for him to score lots of points with the other O, or with something like A12 ABRI, etc, so doing QINTAR not only blocks the lane but if he plays on the triple i can finish killing the board. the problem with it is if he had the Z. i figured he didn't have it after HAE or else he would have maybe played it at B13. The K can also hurt me though. this is a difficult move and i don't know if 15A ON is indeed the play. What do you do here? (-6)

#note bad valuation but highest win%, there may be something even higher. ZEE would really suck though but i'd still maybe have a shot. what does everyone like?
