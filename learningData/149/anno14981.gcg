>Jesse: EHIMOTU 8H MOUTH +28 28
#note JD: sims better than 8D possibly because of mouthier
>Rafi: AEFHIOP 9G FOH +30 30
#note RS: As it turns out, FOH on top would have worked out much better for me.
>Jesse: AEIOTTU 7K AUTO +12 40
#note JD: I liked the gamble on this turn to keep a considerably better leave, but in actually I don't increase my bingo percentage by playing this instead of OUTATE due to how closed the board is already. I guess it also depends on what kind of game I want to play - open board after OUTEAT V closed board after OUTATE v volatile board after AUTO.
>Rafi: AAEIIPQ -AAEIIPQ +0 30
#note RS: PEA is the only play worth considering. I traded the E because there weren't any on the board yet so duplication was more likely. Quackle likes PEA best on 4-ply but prefers exchanging 6 on 3-ply... I guess I could draw QAID for 39 if I play PEA.
>Jesse: ?EEISST K4 StE..ITES +82 122
#note JD: also stateside
>Rafi: AEINRRT 10B TRAINER +71 101
>Jesse: CEILPQX 6E EXCIPL. +36 158
#note JD: close with dumping the Q at L3 now
>Rafi: ABCELMO C3 BECLAMO. +82 183
#note RS: CEMBALOS is another option... I figured the board was so open that board position was pretty irrelevant at this score - none of the bingoes do anything terrible/amazing to the board so I went for the points.
>Jesse: AGOQRVW E3 VOW.R +22 180
#note JD: trying to create somewhere to dump the Q next turn
>Rafi: EGIIOOR 8H .....IER +43 226
>Jesse: AAGILQR L3 QI +26 206
>Rafi: GGIIOOV 8A VI. +24 250
#note RS: Now I can start closing the board. Not too many I's left so I likely have first access to the QI spot, and a big play there could allow me to pull away.
>Jesse: AAAGLRY 2D GAY +27 233
#note JD: really should play gayal, the board is already very volatile anyway and I need to start taking chances
>Rafi: ADGGIOO 1F AGOG +23 273
>Jesse: AADELRW 11E DEWAR +41 274
>Rafi: DEFIINO M2 FINO +39 312
>Jesse: AAJLNNT 4B J.T.N +24 298
>Rafi: DEIKOST N1 DESK +48 360
>Jesse: AABDLNZ N6 Z..AL +36 334
#note JD: kind of wanted to fish for moralize or something, not sure I see a better play than this. ZOEA keeps the R open but a much clunkier leave
>Rafi: EIIPRTU 3E .IRTUE +18 378
#note RS: I was about to put down EURIPI/LE, until I noticed. Completely missed SITUP/SIRUP, which are pretty strong options as well. I played VIRTUE instead of VIRTU because of the three unseen E's, plus I'm turning over another tile for a shot at the S or blank. SITUP/SIRUP have the benefit of blocking miracle bingoes from the R.
>Jesse: ?ABDELN H8 ....L +8 342
#note JD: it's hard to evaluate this play with quackle. I think moral gives rafi a hard time if he doesn't have the S - I have a shot at racks like SUBDEAN that he may have a rough time blocking just by hooking MORALE. However, he probably has other ways of blocking anyway. The trouble is that my only existing lane from the R. With 20/20 hindsight, I think my favorite play is BE at J2 fishing for PINTAILED at B7 - hopefully inducing a block of column O by Rafi. I also saw that fishing the N gave me a nice shot at READABLE/READABLY, but I have nowhere very good to fish - maybe TIN/NA to make it harder for rafi to block?
>Rafi: EINOPSY 12A PENIS +24 402
#note RS: I couldn't help but laugh when I played this... how often is PENIS the best play? OY.
>Jesse: ?ABDENU O1 ED +25 367
#note JD: I was trying to block OY, should play UNBE instead
>Rafi: ADENOY 2H ANY +34 436
>Jesse: ?ABNU 1A BUNA +25 392
#note I went over
