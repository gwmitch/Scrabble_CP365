>Kim_Proulx: DIU H6 DUI +8 8
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILNWW G5 WIN +13 13
#note I burned way too much time here - there's probably minimal difference between playing this and exchanging. I banked on being able to get a counter play with WOW or WAW next turn. The best simming exchange, dumping ILWW, is ranked only slightly behind.
>Kim_Proulx: HOO F4 OOH +34 42
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEILTW E5 LWEI +37 50
#note Tried to see every combination - missed TWICE.
>Kim_Proulx: DFI D3 DIF +24 66
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCEINT C2 NIB +20 70
#note Yeah, that would have been a BITCHEN find. Anagram = BENTHIC.
>Kim_Proulx: JO B1 JO +22 88
#note She seemed pretty dissatisfied with this play - not sure why.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEEET A2 CEE +11 81
#note I was equally dissatisfied with this play, but it might create the impression that I have nothing good on my rack and I'm just trying to block. I did miss E(I)DE completely, though.
>Kim_Proulx: EOTV 9F VETO +14 102
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAERTY 10I YA +12 93
#note D7 YA sims better, but AI isn't the best setup... at least with YA hanging out in the middle, I have some flexibility with where the R can go.
>Kim_Proulx: GILR K10 GIRL +17 119
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEPRT L4 RETAPEs +79 172
#note She wasn't sure on YAGS. Bingos on the D column fare better but I'm not sure why. They are all pretty close either way.
>Kim_Proulx: EIKRRST D8 STRIKER +77 196
#note Well, if I knew she had THAT...
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIILNN E11 NIL +18 190
#note Lazy miss, trying to hurry myself up so I don't fold at the end.
>Kim_Proulx: OY K4 OY +22 218
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIMNPS 15D SAMPING +102 292
#note Total guess, thought samp was short for sample or something. I gave her adequate time to hold, she tried to call a hold after I drew all my tiles - I told her it was too late.
>Kim_Proulx: EF M8 EF +22 240
>Matthew_Larocque: ACLOSUU 14G ULU +11 303
#note Autopilot U dump, didn't see OCU(L)US or even know the L hook.
>Kim_Proulx: ?DEGNST N8 STiNGED +77 317
>Kim_Proulx: ?DEGNST --  -77 240
#note Wow! As if a 102 point phony wasn't lucky enough, she didn't know STaNGED or NiDGETS. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ACOORSU 8J CO..RS +30 333
#note Knowing the opponent's rack is very useful info, but it can lead to extreme overthinking in order to not screw up. Chances are good that she does not know her sevens, so I probably don't need to block them, but it doesn't hurt to play it safe. Despite the 3 vowel leave, I'm getting 30 points and tossing an S in a dangerous spot -  hopefully that will fluster her a bit. She's also getting really low on time. Simulation is reeeeally slow with opponent rack specified, so I asked champ. Yeah no.... why would I play O(PE)RA.
>Kim_Proulx: ?DEGNST J4 GED +19 259
#note She should definitely keep her E. It's tough for her though, because I'm not gonna keep the S open.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEOUV O8 .UAVE +9 342
#note With partial rack, champ still wants me to leave the S open. I don't get it.
>Kim_Proulx: ?DENST 13I DE.TS +22 281
>Matthew_Larocque: AAMOORX -  +0 342
#note Needless challenge, I know that Kim only ever plays phonies by complete accident. I didn't know what DELT meant, but all the fours ending in ELT take an s.
>Kim_Proulx: H G13 H.. +12 293
#note She's basically out of time at this point.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAMOORX C13 MO +20 362
#note Not sure why I opted out of 3G MOXA, the worst case scenario is probably ZETA. Need to utilize my tracking more.
>Kim_Proulx: ?ANQ 9B QA. +13 306
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEORX M2 AXE +25 387
#note Didn't write this rack down, but Quackle is really hating my play...... by a LOT. I must be giving her a shot at a huge play but I don't see it. AERO M3 is cool but I don't see a great reason to leave the X until the last minute.
>Kim_Proulx: ?ABNNTT 2L N.B +10 316
#note She doesn't have time to look for longer plays and just puts something down.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAORZ 10N Z. +31 418
#note I think it was at this point that we found our scores were not matching up, and we decided to double check everything. Unfortunately, when I went to pause the clock I did not press the button hard enough and my time kept running the whole time. >_<
>Kim_Proulx: ?ANTT 11M TA. +17 333
#note Her out is TANTo, a word that I didn't even know.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAOR 14M ORA +8 426
#note Now I'm well into overtime myself and can't find the best plays, stupidly giving her a nice out.
>Kim_Proulx: ?NT 15M TeN +16 349
>Kim_Proulx:  (A) +2 351
#note She was nice enough to give me credit for 1 minute, although I'm pretty sure we spent a lot more than 1 minute recounting. She lost -40 and I lost -30 to end 399-310. Wait, we recounted and the scores are still off? Ha ha what.
