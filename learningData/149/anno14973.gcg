>Joshua_Sokol: AHILMUU H8 ULU +6 6
#note HAMULI, right. This was a terrible play to start it off. HILUM, HAULM and MIAUL are all way better than this.
>Scott_Kitchen: ADN G9 AND +10 10
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAHIMY F6 MAYA +18 24
#note I was looking at HIMA(L)AYA*. This is up there.
>Scott_Kitchen: CORW G4 CROW +26 36
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIILOS 4G .HIAO +14 38
#note Maybe I should have gone for points here, but the words that score the most (LAICH, SCHOLIA and SHOALY) were ones I didn't know. I was thinking that I might bait CHIAOS*.
>Scott_Kitchen: AKN H1 ANK. +33 69
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILSX J3 G.LAXIES +70 108
>Scott_Kitchen: BFO K9 FOB +23 92

#note ZO(O)ID K2 I didn't see.
>Scott_Kitchen: ?BEGIST M5 BIGgEST +72 164
#note Not the best placement...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFNORW 8A FROWN. +57 203
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFNORW --  -57 146
#note I saw FOREkN(O)W here, but I didn't like the points it gave back, and I saw FROWN(Y) and really liked the play.
>Scott_Kitchen: AEELOST 12A OLEATES +71 235
#note Unfortunately FROWNY is no good... 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFNORW A6 FOREkN.W +89 235
#note Now I can play FOREkN(O)W. Had I known FOREWORN I would have played it last turn.
>Scott_Kitchen: EIRTUV -  +0 235
#note Challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIJORU 2F JU. +26 261
#note Not the best play. B2 OURIE looks good here.
>Scott_Kitchen: EIRTUV B1 VIRTUE +29 264

>Scott_Kitchen: DELOP N2 LOPED +35 299
>Joshua_Sokol: EINORSY O1 YO +17 305
#note T(Y)ROSINE... I was going to play YO I6 and then LOPED changed my mind.
>Scott_Kitchen: EHNRT 14I THR.NE +34 333
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINRRS O6 SERRINE +78 383
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINRRS --  -78 305
#note Here's a huge mistake. ZIN here seems to win most times. I thought this was good, and then I thought that I screwed up and that the only thing good in this rack was REINERS*. Turns out I'm stupid.
