#note Spent altogether too much time deciding between D10 and F10 here. As I ultimately decided, it's pretty much a tossup.

#note Well, I did hold this play, I should get extra credit of some sort. It's also good in Collins...yeah, that's it, I had Collins confusion. Huge missed opportunity for me here.

#note Going for a bomb, though i did miss J6 DEOXY. Challenging and playing D4 DOXY (or, most long-term bingo-defensively of all, D4 DEOXY) leaves me in such great shape, though. Too bad.

#note Almost did B9 POI holding the last vowel that plays with ?P (OP) and blocking easy Q plays, and quickly regretted not doing so. I just thought that it would allow Joey to block up the other side of the board and force me to play a Z- bingo to win, but if he has the Q he's actually in quite a bit of a bind and may be forced to play QI 5C.

#note Looks like I1 WISP gives me the best chance...feeling some time pressure here.
