>Kenji_Matsumoto: EFLMU 8D FLUME +28 28
>Winter: ADIPRTW G6 WI.P +15 15
#note I did see (FLUME)D, but I wasn't sure, and so my weakness became Kenji's sweetness.

You're going to laugh.

>Kenji_Matsumoto: DEIOOZ H1 DOOZIE +83 111
#note Yes, very much so.
>Winter: ACDRSTT -CDT +0 15
#note 
I wouldn't do this against a weaker player, but I see and acknowledge that I must get lucky to beat Kenji, and that's what I'm playing for.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AHIRSST 3C AIRSH.TS +82 193
#note Kenji should have played SH(O)RTIAS, just so I could have exclaimed "go Shortia, get stupid! Go shortia, get stupid!"
>Winter: AAENRST 10G SANTERA +71 86
#note Consulting a santera is pretty much the only way I'm going to beat Kenji.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEEEHRT 1A REHEATE. +89 282
#note As I sim this game, I'm ordering from India Kabab, a meal large enough for dinner and, tomorrow, a reheated lunch.
>Winter: DILNTUU 2J ULU +9 95
#note Laugh, and the whole world laughs with you, right?
>Kenji_Matsumoto: BGIOOY E5 BIO.OGY +52 334
#note I never liked biology. The smell of formaldehyde nauseates me.
>Winter: BDIINOT D11 BID +19 114
#note Thanks to FLUMED, I'm going to leak a million points of equity in this game.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DKNU L9 D.UNK +20 354
>Winter: ?AINOST A1 .AINOuTS +74 188
#note Hurm. StATION would have been nice.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AENNX 1K ANNEX +44 398
>Winter: ACEEIPT C10 CAPE +34 222
#note I've learned PATIENCE in life, but not in Scrabble.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: FG 11K F.G +27 425
>Winter: ?AEEILT 13L .AE +14 236
#note I knew MEATLIKE* is no good, but I wasn't sure of GATELIKE or anything else I saw. In the absence of that play, I decided to pass on ELATIvE given the dreck that was in the bag. The game was lost, but I still wanted to minimize my spread loss--I'll need that spread if I want to win second.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: GV N12 V.G +14 439
>Winter: ?EEILTV N1 .VE +12 248
#note Saw VELITEs, and should have played it. If I had seen that drawing the Q might yield 44 points, if Kenji didn't take the L spot, I probably would have, but by this point I'd lost focus.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: JT 3M J.T +20 459
>Winter: ?EILMQT 6D Q. +11 259
#note I was hoping Kenji would draw it, but at least I won't get stuck with it.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DOR 4L DOR +24 483
>Winter: ?EILMRT 14F MILTERs +76 335
#note I actually bingoed three times, but I'm still going to lose by nearly 200 points.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IWY H12 WI.Y +42 525
#note Yes, Kenji, you most certainly are.
>Winter: ACOO 15D COO +12 347
