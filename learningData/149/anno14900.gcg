#note I lost my round 5 scoresheet to Mike Stafford - I do know I pushed him 2 minutes overtime and played weak.                        This was a hard game, mainly because Connie was giving me the death stare a lot of the game. Quite intimidating.
>Connie_Breitbeil: AMY 7H YAM +20 20
>Avery_Mojica: ILNORXZ 6I LOX +24 50
#note I didn't like this, but it's best.
>Connie_Breitbeil: DDEE 5J DEED +36 56
>Avery_Mojica: INOQRVZ -QVZ +0 50
#note I'm surprised this doesn't make it higher on the sim, or even in CP's picks.
>Connie_Breitbeil: AORR 4K ROAR +25 81
#note So it's going to be one of THOSE kinds of games...
>Avery_Mojica: AEIINOR 9F ION +20 70
#note JIAO definitely would have opened the bottom part of the board. Probably a better idea.
>Connie_Breitbeil: HOP 3M HOP +32 113
>Avery_Mojica: ACDEIRS N2 C.. +10 80
#note I could not remember if CION was good... I thought it was only SCION. 
>Connie_Breitbeil: T G8 ..T +10 123
>Avery_Mojica: ADEIRSS 11D DAIS +21 101
#note Just the S at J5 is good, which I considered. This isn't bad.
>Connie_Breitbeil: NU D11 .UN +8 131
>Avery_Mojica: AEGLRRS 14D GLARERS +68 169
#note Someone was talking about at the beginning of the tournament that LARGER had no anagrams. A lot of people thought GLARERS* was good. I picked up on that, and had to risk it to open the board. I knew for sure it wasn't, but oh well. 
>Connie_Breitbeil: FRT H12 FR.T +33 164
>Avery_Mojica: BFHIIOY -BOIFY +0 169
#note Didn't see the DUNGY hook. BOYI(S)H is good too. All I could hope for was something at 15J. Bad.
>Connie_Breitbeil: DENV J10 VEND. +17 181
>Avery_Mojica: BCEHIVZ 11I Z.BEC +36 205
#note 13B ZINEB is better.
>Connie_Breitbeil: AM 12J .AM +22 203
>Avery_Mojica: AHIOPTV 3I HOP +25 230
>Connie_Breitbeil: ??BEFLO 2D FOiBLEs +66 269
#note 4C BEEFALO or E3 BIOFUEL. Moving this over 1 spot is better. 
>Avery_Mojica: AEGITTV 1A VAGI +33 263
#note lol 1C VITTAE
>Connie_Breitbeil: AA 1G AA +16 285
>Avery_Mojica: EGIKRTT E10 K.T +9 272
#note I had no clue ZEBEC took a K at the end. No clue what to do here. All of CP and Q's suggestions involve ZEBECK in some way, except 13J DREK, which I didn't see. 
>Connie_Breitbeil: EIW A1 .IEW +14 299
#note I was relieved when she didn't extend it to make VIEWIEST.
>Avery_Mojica: EEGINRT M9 NI.ER +22 294
#note Another tough play. Q suggests fishing along the B column, but I need points to stay alive. 
>Connie_Breitbeil: EIST A1 ....IEST +42 341
#note lol
