#note I hadn't a clue what to do here. Does anyone know how to make the correct decision here? I'm not saying this is right. I really don't have much good reasoning for it but I had to play something eventually :(.

#note Ugh, missed AVOW C3 which is a huge improvement. I hated making this play and really should've looked longer for better plays. I even thought of OW I1 and didn't properly consider it. It looks like it's probably better as well. No good reason to play this.
