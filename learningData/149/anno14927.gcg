#note Gosh, this play is terribly unsafe, but everything else seemed too big a sacrifice. I noted that CEIBA provided a credible X threat with FAX, but it doesn't seem like it hits/stays open enough.

#note Whiff on 7F KAB/KABAR. KAGU doesn't really do much, but there isn't much doing here anyway - I suppose BURKA is a slight improvement.

#note Waffled between COMET and BROMIC for a while, but I missed TOMTIT which I would have slapped down immediately.

>Will: AEHIRTU A8 HA.U +27 204
#note HABITUE smokes the sim - I played HABU extremely fast and didn't see it. Not sure I love turning the esses I don't have into an automatic and easy 45 points, though.
