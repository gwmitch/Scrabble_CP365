#note I'm just really not a fan of 60 point bingos when I'm not desperate, and I don't need to open the board. Hence why I passed up the plays.

#note Still not desperate, don't need to play DEPAINTS. Though based on what people say, maybe I should. I'm just stupid enough to talk myself out of doing it. Since I'm good on defensive boards, I guess I have reasons. Either way, PANDIT B10.
