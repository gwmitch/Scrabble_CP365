#note The SQUILL hook was overlooked (but debated) by both of us. This isn't a word. I couldn't remember if something went on the end, but there's nothing. DANDYISM and DYNAMIST are the misses. I misadded and now my score reads 10 less than it should.

#note He held this for about 8 minutes, debating what to do. It's acceptable.

#note His actual rack, as he told me I blocked INULASES. NUBIAS is best.

#note Since I still don't know SQUILL, this is best.
>Jason_Idalski: EES H12 E.ES +12 324
#note I wrote down that he played EYES for 12, but the blank in DISMAYS would have had to be a Y, and I didn't even put the Y there. I don't remember what he did. Maybe ESES.

#note And this is where I screw up the whole game. I knew clearly that there was one (or two, if SQUILL was good) lane(s) available. I couldn't block the top one, but I had to debate what was left. If there was an R or an I in the bag, he would bingo out and win. If it was anything else, I'd win. I got so caught up in this that once I figured out the odds were in my favor, I slapped this down and hoped for the best. OF COURSE, I miss the 7M spot in my excitement. Had I done that, he had done what he does here, and I knew SQUILL, I could have bingoed on my last turn (I would have tried it definitely).

>Avery_Mojica: GINORST 15A T.IG +21 442
#note C2 TRIGONS would have been my out play here. I didn't think of extending this to make TRIGON/AWN. Bad endgame. Got too excited with the tracking. Very much a learning experience.

#note Final score shows as 403-435. I could have played that a lot better.
