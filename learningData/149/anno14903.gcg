#note Time for a fresh start. And drawing both blanks is a great way to do that. I didn't need to cheat them to get them either. I wasn't sure about EXALTER, didn't see DEXTRAL or TRIPLEX.
>Pete_Zeigler: IITT 9F TITI +21 21
>Avery_Mojica: ??ERRTT -RT +0 20
#note TITTERER - and I want to score well since I have the blanks, not waste them on some measly 60-point play. Surprisingly, this sims well. 
>Pete_Zeigler: FHIR F6 FRI.H +38 59
>Avery_Mojica: ??AERST 11E ESTRAys +82 102
#note I'm so lucky
>Pete_Zeigler: ENOV H11 .OVEN +27 86

#note Didn't see the SILEX hook. 
>Pete_Zeigler: OPQ 10C QOP. +22 108
>Avery_Mojica: AAILNSS 12B LAIN +13 128
#note NASALISE... or G7 ALIST which I don't think I would have found. This is a weak set-up.

#note VANS > VAN
>Pete_Zeigler: DEFGIT M10 FIDGET +31 160
>Avery_Mojica: ABENRSS 14B BAN +23 169
#note LIST and ALIST are still near the top. I don't want to expose my Ses though. 
>Pete_Zeigler: MORW 14J MOW.R +32 192
#note He spent a very long time on this play.

>Pete_Zeigler: AAIMZ D1 ZAMIA +54 246
#note yikes! two bingos ahead and i'm barely winning
>Avery_Mojica: ACEGNYY 2B CY.N +18 272
#note CYMAE - this play sucks
>Pete_Zeigler: EJKU N6 JUKE +39 285
>Avery_Mojica: AEEGRWY 14F WY. +17 289
#note I couldn't bring myself to EMERY or AMEER. I couldn't remember how to spell EMERY, and AMEER has too many variant spellings. I eventually give up, but this still sims in the top 10 of Q static
>Pete_Zeigler: DL K13 D.L +4 289
>Avery_Mojica: AEEEGHR C2 .EH +31 320
#note EMERGE is good, but opens up too much with that fish he just did. 
>Pete_Zeigler: ADENR 1D .ANDER +50 339
#note ouch
>Avery_Mojica: AEEGIPR B4 PEG +18 338
#note I don't know why PEAG sims so much higher than this, considering I have the case A.
>Pete_Zeigler: GO F1 .OG +18 357
>Avery_Mojica: AEIIRSU A6 AUREI +18 356
#note J1 SIEUR... or ALIST still lol
>Pete_Zeigler: CDIOTTU O2 DITTO +16 373
>Avery_Mojica: IS J1 SI +21 377
#note I'm really not Division 1 material based on this. He said I played very well, but I don't really think that describes bingoing 2-0 and winning by this much. Didn't deserve to win this either.
>Avery_Mojica:  (CU) +8 385
#note Something got severely underscored, so it's 385-373 technically, instead of what we agreed on as 385-362.
