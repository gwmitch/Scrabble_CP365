#note Would like WRY better with an A in hand, but it still has to be better than WEARY. WALY and YAWP would have been clear improvements too.

#note 6L ADZ was scary because Stefan almost certainly had an E at this point, but playing is clearly better than exchanging. Gotta take the risk.

#note Setting up FUND/FUNS plays along column O while blocking the G, but I think I don't score enough on this turn for FUN to be worth it. CP says 1I EMIC wins a quarter of the time, probably going for a combo of SAFETIED along row 11 if I draw the T, and DEFRAGS/DEFANGS 15H if I draw RNN. Seems right to me. Oh, how wonderful it would be to master the pre-endgame.

#note There's that N. Of course, had I not played FUN, he would probably play RAVING and that would be that.
