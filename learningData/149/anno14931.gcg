#note Almost did ZOON, and missed 6C BONZE, which seems a little risky with RRRSSS out, though maybe Matthew doesn't know BONZER? I bet he does.

#note Okay, first mistake I'd classify as big. Why let Matthew hammer that X spot if I can prevent it? If I play the H at 14F, Matthew needs the case O to play anything huge under there. Quackle likes AHI, I imagine because it guarantees me access to a triple unless he has that O, and sheds my I with 6 more to come - it's certainly riskier, though.
