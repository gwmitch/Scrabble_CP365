#note I like the defensive values of VENAE but EVE bingos so much next turn that it seems worth it (56 pts per turn V 41 after YAPON)

#note given how long conrad has had to groom his rack by this point, I like KOHLS at N2 better rather than a move that gives him more bingo lanes to work with like MOHEL. There are two blanks and 3 esses left so hoarding the S is not worthwhile.

#note at the time I really liked this move because all of the high-pointers that would fit at 15H were gone, but now it just seems like I was giving conrad free points. the play I like now is ERGO at 12A - with only one I and one U it's not that easy for him to play on row 14, so I leave myself two nice lanes to try and hit for net turn.
>Conrad: EEILRSU 15H LEISURE +80 345
#note gutsy, he's likely in a lot of trouble after GIE but he can't pass up the points I don't think.
>JD: ?ACEORR 2C CORRAdE. +62 350
#note crazy that I can't bingo on the bottom-right. rancored at 2c gives me more counter-play than corraded, assuming that he's likely to hit the bottom-right
