#note think he said his rack was something like this?
>JD: AGNNNQR 6B GNA.N +15 43
#note sometimes I get tranq blindness. not sure why. the decision between exchanging AGNR, playing QUAG and playing GNAWN is kind of interesting, and I realized after the fact that I should've just exchanged...but then quackle tells you you suck and you move on

#note unfortunate that he blocked invertor, even though it cleans up my rack a lot I really shouldn't be giving mike a shot at a triple after he has a turn to groom his rack. should've plaed ROVED.

>JD: ?BEIRTX 10B XI +36 137
#note holding the X is usually not what I try to do with the blank in hand, but quackle loves playing BITER at 10B with lots of shots at 40-50 point X plays next turn and the blank in hand. sure, why not.

#note he evidently had the second blank somewhere around this point

#note non-intuitive to me but quackle likes it

#note believe he said this was his rack
>JD: ILOORUU 13J LU.U +8 321
#note inexplicable decision, the only tile that matters is the blank, should just x6. sure he can block but at least he has to think about it.

#note this is kind of a zugzwang position, best play is ABA at J9 not opening any scoring plays for him. this gives up veenas for 50. still only 2 down on optimal though
