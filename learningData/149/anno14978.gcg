>Ceasar: AAINOTZ 8F AZO +24 24
#note probably just play it at 8H since i do have the N. silly. (-1)
>JD: EGLNRRW F6 WR.NGLER +74 74
#note boom
>Ceasar: ADIIINT I7 INIA +19 43
#note that was a lame draw but i just gotta try to find the best thing
>JD: AENNORU H10 NEURON +23 97
>Ceasar: CDDIIRT 12C DIC. +14 57
#note also considered TILDE and DIDIE.
>JD: ABGIMRX J10 GAMB +21 118
#note thought I would keep XI guaranteed for next turn, but IR combines poorly with the X
>Ceasar: ADEIRTT 15H .ITRATED +80 137
>JD: FIORUWX N10 FIXUR. +48 166
>Ceasar: CGRSTTT 13L TR.G +10 147
#note one thing i gotta work on is when i am having a bad tourney is to not be so paranoid about scoring. exchanging keeping RST is a perfectly good play here! (-4)
>JD: ABINOWY K11 BY +29 195
#note I didn't play bawdy because...uh...I blame cesar
>Ceasar: CDJLSTT 7H J.LT +20 167
>JD: AEINOSW O6 WINOES +34 229
#note seemed like a good time to flip over some tiles and go for the blanks, quackle prefers WOE by a little. there also seemed to be a nonzero chance of drawing a challenge
>Ceasar: CDIOSTV 14A DIVOTS +39 206
#note i was worried about QADI just ending my dreams, but VOIDS just seems to give up too much.
>JD: ??AAEEY C12 .A.Y +22 251
#note a little greedy here, but if I'm going to do this quackle suggests just playing YEA at E4...expected score next turn goes up by 15! sure cesar is likely to play over there, but it decreases my chances of missing a 3x3 by drawing too many vowels.
>Ceasar: CEHMTUV A8 MUTCHE. +57 263
>Ceasar: CEHMTUV --  -57 206
#note i thought there was a decent chance i could get away with it frankly (and a decent chance it was good.) collins-only though.
>JD: ??AEENP A8 tAPENa.E +140 391
#note did not come up with kneepads
>Ceasar: CEHMTUV K5 VE.CH +26 232
>JD: AAAFLLO N6 ALA +16 407
>Ceasar: HMPTU M3 HUMP +30 262
#note don't know my other two letters :/
>JD: AEFILOS B8 ALIF +23 430
#note should keep an I in case I draw the Q, quackle loves FOE at E5 for some reason. also can put the I at J8 which is cool
>Ceasar: DEEOQTU 2J QUOTE +80 342
#note quoted so i can go out next turn maybe, and block ose?
>JD: EEEIKOS O1 OSE +24 454
>Ceasar: DEOOS C7 DOES +19 361
#note jesse: he's supposed to play OX first to keep me from playing EEK (he would have DOES/SEEK) cesar: doh
