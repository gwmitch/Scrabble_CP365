#note Not much to choose from here. I decided to risk setting up my S. If Ross doesn't have one, he's short on options, and I'm gonna score well. Worst case, KNSU is not the worst leave for scoring somewhere. G7 UKE keeping NSVW was unappealing to me, but that's Quackle's choice by 3 points over this play.

#note Ugh, nasty position. I hated making a board-killing play against Ross, who is good at holding onto small leads on tight boards. But there aren't many anternatives. In hindsight, I kind of like 12K DROID, which gives up a bit of equity for a more promising board. I think that's what I should have done. Quackle likes CORD, but Quackle doesn't know Ross.

#note This is inexplicable. I spent time on this turn, but the plays I deliberated were 11E COVED and 14B COXED. Somehow it completely eluded me that COVED fits at 14B, too. I decided the X was valuable enough on this board to warrant a sacrifice to keep it on my rack. I hated setting up a huge Y, but really, setting up a parallel atop ORE and BED is risky, too. I think I'm right to keep the X, but my blindness this turn was disappointing. 14A COAXED 45.4, 14B COVED 43.2, 14B COXED 42.7, 11E COVED 41.1..........

#note I wanted to make a blockier play, but with the powerful YYZ looming, I decided my lead was not big enough for that. This sims 1 point worse than O1 DEAN. I didn't see any huge need to block that spot, but since XI is likely to stay open forever, I might as well put off playing it. DEAN goes for turnover, which seems valuable and which was the main reason I was so hesitant to take XI now. Yup, makes sense.

#note Big sacrifice over O1 MEAD, but the time felt right to kill bingo lanes. This sims 3 points behind O1 MEAD. I guess I'm just as likely to lose to a big Z as I am to a bingo?

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADENOOS 15A DONAS +37 340
#note I didn't see O1 AEON, but other than the unlikely ZEIN, is blocking that spot really an issue? I just wanted to race. But the problem is setting up a huge FEZ/LEZ. Maybe not the best idea. 3 point error on the sim
