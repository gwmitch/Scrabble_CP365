>moh: AEEERST -E +0 0
#note Obvious.
>jeff: DOPQRUU 8F QUOD +28 28
#note QUOD is best.
>moh: AAEERST J2 AERATES +76 76
#note So far this game is playing itself. Neither of us has had any decisions whatsoever.
>jeff: EILPRUX K2 ILEX +46 74
#note Quackle prefers K5 XI over ILEX by a nose.
>moh: AGILNUU F8 .UA +14 90
#note Or 4I U(RE)A 8.
>jeff: EFJPRRU L4 FER +34 108
#note 4E PERJU(RE)R 50!
>moh: BGILNNU 11C LUBING +31 121
#note Missed 10C UN(B)ALING 65. LUBING is next-best.
>jeff: IJPRRTU M2 JUT +27 135
#note Or 3G JUR(EL) 21.
>moh: ?DEHNNO N1 NOH +35 156
#note Best.
>jeff: EIPRRRS 12B RIPES +42 177
#note RIPES is best.
>moh: ??DENOT A8 DENOTed +80 236
#note There are tons of bingos in this spot, all basically equal.
>jeff: BCENORR B6 CRONE +24 201
#note I1 ORB 19 seems better. After CRONE, there are no promising bingo lanes, and you're down.
>moh: CDEIILR H11 .LIDE +24 260
#note I didn't want to open up the board, but this was the only place to score. GLIDE, GELID, and GRIDE are all pretty close.
>jeff: ABMNORT 13C BOT +30 231
#note Bot is best.
>moh: ACEIORV 14H .IVORCE +42 302
#note Not surprisingly, (D)IVORCE sims best. If you can't hook it, the game is over, and even if you can, I should still be up unless you bingo there. In the worst-case scenario, I'm probably taking the lead on my next play, and in the best-case scenario, I'm sealing the game. That was my thinking, anyway.
>jeff: AMNNRVY O12 VARY +56 287
#note Timing keeps you in it.
>moh: AIIOTWY L12 WI.Y +28 330
#note Missed O1 OW! Ugh. 
>jeff: AAEMNNS 14D NAM +23 310
#note NAM is best.
>moh: ADIILOT O1 AT +22 352
#note I didn't really like keeping two Is, but with only one more in the bag, I thought a third was unlikely enough that I took the highest-scoring opportunity.
>jeff: AAEGNSZ K11 ZA +27 337
#note Or 6L (R)AZE 33. ZA is certainly the safer choice.
>moh: DEIIKLO M9 DIKE +17 369
#note DIKE is probably best.
>jeff: AEGIMNS 5I M...S +25 362
#note Too bad you had no place for your vacant brains. stem. 9A (EN)G isn't crazy, but it scores so meagerly that you're committed to winning with a bingo instead of without. That said, AMINES is a heck of a leave, and there is only one other S to hook ENG-S. If I don't have it, I'm going to score next to nothing trying to block (from the R or CRONE?), or I might even have to play elsewhere and leave it. ENG wins the sim, but that should be taken with a grain of salt because the sim doesn't expect me to block the ENG-S lane. Much of the same can be said for 8A (DO)G. A middle way is 9D GA(U)M, which scores enough that you still have a decent chance to win without a bingo, but it sets up the G for an -ING bingo, and it's less obviouvs you're playing to set up, so I'm less inclined to block it. GAUM wins about 40% of the time, MAXES wins about 25% of the time.
>moh: EHILOSW 9F .H +18 387
#note I thought about 10L H(I)E 8, which sets up the HIE-S hook that only I can use on the triple (no unseen Ds). But you're just close enough that if my setup doesn't work out (if you block it while somehow scoring decently), then I'm trailing going into the endgame. My UH and the HIE setup win about the same percentage of the time.
>jeff: AEFGINT I13 F.T +21 383
#note N10 FA scores well, and I think you said that the only reason you didn't play there it is that I implied that I had the only remaining S. N9 EF avoids the S issue pretty well, but there are three unseen tiles that hook DE, and with three in the bag, the chances are very likely that I've got at least one hook letter (about 3% if I'm doing the math right). But there's another option that scores well there: N6 GANEF 37! AS luck would have it, I would have played LOWE or something for a lot of points to respond.
>moh: AEILOSW 7L AWL +17 404
>moh: AEILOSW --  -17 387
#note O8 SALI(VARY) 42! Are you freaking kidding me?!
>jeff: AEGGINP C7 EGG +22 405
#note The all-star finds were both at 7H: GA(E)ING and GE(E)ING. I've got no response, and you would only have three tiles. No draw is really bad with the PE or PA you'd have, and the game would effectively be over. How over? You win even if I find that cool SALI(VARY) play next time.
>moh: AEILOSW D4 WALES +28 415
#note I was low on time, but once I hit the clock I regretted not playing WALIES in the same spot, leaving OVARY for the out.
>jeff: AINOP C4 OP +13 418
#note Sadly, there's no win for you at this point, according to Quackle.
>moh: IO L8 OI +6 421
#note Either out play wins; nothing else does.
>moh:  (AIN) +6 427
