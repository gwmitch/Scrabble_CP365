>Jason: AAAETUW 8F AWA +12 12
>Rafi_Stern: AAILMRW 9H MAW +13 13
#note This was a pretty crappy play... (W)AW is much better defensively and sets up the L hook.
>Jason: ABERTUU 10G BUREAU +24 36
#note Hoping I'd have a good spot to dump BUREAU and getting it, I blanked on ARBUTE at 8J. (-5)
>Rafi_Stern: AILLPRV 11C VILLA +20 33
#note Another mistake... PL(U)VIAL is better.
>Jason: ??ENRRT 11I TERNaRy +75 111
#note Highest-scoring bingo, puts a blank Y in the triple. What's not to like?
>Rafi_Stern: AENPQRX O7 PREX. +39 72
>Jason: EEFIIIM -EFIIIM +0 111
#note FE(R)MI seemed needlessly risky with all four S's out. But it's Q's clear pick. Yeah, probably should've played it. (-12)
>Rafi_Stern: AAENOPQ N8 OPE.A +26 98
>Jason: EEEHOSZ 13I HEEZES +52 163
#note Glad both W's are gone...
>Rafi_Stern: AFGHJNQ D8 FAG.N +26 124
#note Quackle likes JIG best, but I don't. I was really torn between trading or playing FAGIN here, and while Quackle supports FAGIN, I think trading FHJQ or FJQ may be better. 
>Jason: EIOOORU 8A ROO. +21 184
#note 18-33 V-C ratio ... I figure I can try to soldier on. Duck still likes the standard keep ER on the exchange. (-1)
>Rafi_Stern: HJOQSST 13B JOSH +38 162
#note JOSH surprisingly loses the sim to QAT by just a tad, but I'll take the extra 26 points any day.
>Jason: EIIKMOU 14B OM +30 214
#note Totally missed KOI in this spot. How bad do I suck? Even OI is way better ... must've just blanked. (-17)
>Rafi_Stern: IOQRSTY 15A OY +28 190
>Jason: EFIIKUY 14I IF +31 245
#note I thought this was safer than KIEF. I don't know why. (-8)
>Rafi_Stern: INQRSTT 15G QIS +42 232
>Jason: EGIKNUY C7 Y.K +30 275
#note Wasn't sure enough of YEUKING and couldn't risk the lost turn. grrr... (-41)
>Rafi_Stern: LNNORTT F5 TON.L +7 239
#note I really didn't know what to do here. I figured with all the E's and I's left, I had a decent shot at bingoing in the next turn or 2 with NRT, and I'm setting up the A hook as well. Quackle likes exch. LNT best by about 1.5%.
>Jason: BDEGINU 5B DEBU.ING +74 349
#note Yeah, that's how it's been going for me this year.
>Rafi_Stern: IINRSTT L13 .IT +13 252
#note Now now!
>Jason: AAEGLNU M7 AGA +16 365
#note Making the only bingo line available to Rafi hard to hit/forces him to give me the triple coming back. Duck likes LAGUNA here instead. (-7)
>Rafi_Stern: DINRSTT C2 TID. +10 262
#note Don't really know how to overcome a 113 point lead with this rack...
>Jason: EIILNOU 2A OU.LINE +18 383
#note Another mediocre pre-endgame play. UTILE, same spot, leads in valuation. But Q says this is a guaranteed win. (-15)
>Rafi_Stern: CDENRST A1 C.RD +27 289
#note Jason: Rafi played really well, just had nothing to work with.
#note Rafi: NOW NOW! Well done.
>Jason: CEEIITV L3 CIVET +22 405
>Rafi_Stern: DENST 1G DENTS +21 310
#note Whoops, I missed TENDS for a few more.
>Rafi_Stern:  (EI) +4 314
