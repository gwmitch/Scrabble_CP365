#note I have no idea how to justify this play.

#note fOURTEEN is technically better.  UREOTELIC for the style points is actually also better.  
>Opponent: AEILMNT H12 M.TE +27 71
>Kenji: ADEIMNS 9B MEDINAS +69 204
#note In this game I make the cardinal mistake of being unsure of a hook.  I just didn't really know PIBALS.

#note Swallowing my pride, just in case.  At this score it's really hard for Quackle to come back.  I assigned about a 60% chance to PIBALS being good throughout this game.

#note You can actually make a very strong case for SEEDY n11 here.  It might well be the better play.  I know that looks like hindsight, but it's actually quite sane in theory here.
