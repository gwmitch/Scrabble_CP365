#note Clearly this was very weak. I had plenty of time, but I just couldn't anything that would lead to a win after the obvious-looking ZA 10J. Eventually I just gave up and went for the out in two. But, if I had played RITZ L11 first, it would really put the pressure on. Dielle would have to block CZAR, and I think SAME J12 is the only way to do that and hang on for the win (by 1 point). Tricky endgame!
