#note Oops. Missed the anagram for a point more. (-1.0)
>David_J.: ?AEOSTT O1 TOASTEr +83 274
#note Gutsy choice by David. And according to Quackle, it's not a bad pick.
>Matthew: AAMNORS 12C OARSMAN +76 367
#note MOAS is significantly behind OARSMAN. But I had a bad feeling about leaving that open.
>David_J.: AJRS 8L JARS +78 352
>Matthew: EEIIPUV A2 .IVIE +14 381
#note Tops in win%. 13B VIE is tight, though.
>David_J.: QT M7 Q.T +23 375
>Matthew: DEMOPPU C2 .OMPED +45 426
#note During this turn I was sure that any decent score sealed the game up. When I saw 45 from ROMPED I thought it was overkill, but actually it blocked BEZEL which makes this game interesting again.
>David_J.: BEGHLVZ G5 B.Z +24 399
>Matthew: DIINOPU 13A NIDI +18 444
#note Grabbed the first out in two I saw. Didn't realise that an out in three could score more. E4 NU threatening OPIOID, so David can't do 13L EH. (-4.0)
