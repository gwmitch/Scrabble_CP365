#note I'm not a big fan of the EGL leave, and I really don't think the game is going to come down to scoring unless we both bingo, which looks unlikely on this board.

#note I'm not really sure.  I don't like my chances of outrunning here, so even though EAU looks ridiculously risky, I figure I need to bingo.  LEA looks okay against Quackle as it blocks accidentally, but I'm still not too sure.

#note Ended up smelling like a rose, but that doesn't make my previous play correct.  A lot of times here I would need to forgo a 58 pointer to play off one tile and try to hit two spots.
