>Evans: EIILTVW 8G WIVE +20 20
>Jesse: BCEEOOU 9C COOEE +17 17
>Evans: ?EILRST K5 bLISTER +85 105
#note Jesse says GLISTER is better because it's tougher to overlap. Good point.
>Jesse: BLRSTUW 12H WURST +31 48
#note Missing BRULOTS E5. Interestingly enough, though, BOWL E8 wins the sim. Jesse saw BOWL and eventually passed it up... he later hated himself for it. Quackle thinks he was right to hate himself.
>Evans: EEFFJOO C9 .OFFEE +28 133
#note Cool setup, am I right?
>Jesse: AABDLRU H12 .AUL +21 69
#note Jesse chickened out on BELAUD. The word is good, but this play seems better anyway.
>Evans: DJORSTT B10 JO +55 188
>Jesse: ABDEIRR L3 BRAID +22 91
#note I have no idea. There are a million things you could make a case for here. Quackle seems to like REBID 14B... whatever.
>Evans: DEGRSTT D8 R.TTED +45 233
#note DOTTER is good for one extra point.
>Jesse: EILORRS 15A LOSER +33 124
#note IR is kinda a crappy leave in this situation. ROSIER is better.
>Evans: AGIMOSY J10 MO.AY +36 269
#note I actually know ISOGAMY. I was kinda pissed that Jesse didn't give me a spot to play it. This is best though.
>Jesse: AADIIRU 3J UR.IA +14 138
>Evans: BCGIIPS N2 B.SIC +30 299
>Jesse: AAADIIN -AAADIIN +0 138
#note If you go by winning percentage, this actually sims best. Cool idea, considering he's down 161.
>Evans: AGHIKPT B13 TH. +26 325
#note Ugh. I saw KAPA 13G but chickened out on the valid four. This is second-best.
>Jesse: EHNNNYZ 10F HEN +33 171
>Evans: AAGIIKP O1 KI +22 347
>Jesse: EENNNYZ 4H YEN +12 183
#note NENE doesn't play basketball anymore this season, but he plays at 2H.
>Evans: AADDGIP H1 GAP. +30 377
#note I didn't know GIDDAP. Second-best.
>Jesse: AELNNNZ 2C ZENAN. +17 200
#note Seeing as Jesse needs to bingo like eight times to come back, this play makes sense.
>Evans: AADDIUV 3A DUAD +37 414
#note Giving him a triple-triple. Whatever. This scores a bunch.
>Jesse: GILMNOQ H7 Q. +11 211
#note Maybe just take DOMING now? I dunno...
>Evans: AGINOVX C2 ..X +19 433
#note Missing DIOXAN. This play is beyond stupid.
>Jesse: GIILMNO A3 .OMING +33 244
>Evans: AAGINOV I11 G.V +25 458
#note Missing GUV I11!
>Jesse: ?EILPT 1F PI.LETs +15 259
#note Missing STIPEL 15J.
