#note I was 95% sure that this was phony and AXLIKE was the correct one. But I didn't see the playables EXEQUIAL and EXILABLE and I somehow talked myself out of ALEXINE. Actually, Chris accepted AXELIKE* because he knew I wouldn't miss ALEXINE. Anyways, EXEQUIAL sims best over an accepted AXELIKE*. (-1.1)

>Matthew: DEEHOQU 7J EH +20 231
#note I did a Specify partial oppo rack (AES) because I figured I could peg him for at least that. My play was meant to be defensive in response to his fish. 3E QUOD sims best. (-4.3)
