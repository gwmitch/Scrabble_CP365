>Bill_Huttell: DFNWY -DFNWY +0 0
#note This was the 2nd game of the club session and I had just had a thrilling victory. The game had gone longer than other peoples' so maybe I wasn't thinking extremely clearly this game.


>Kevin_Leeds: ADHIINS 8F AHI +12 12
#note HID would have made more sense. 

>Bill_Huttell: OVW 9D VOW +14 14
>Kevin_Leeds: ADGINSY 7B DINGY +20 32
#note Was trying too hard to find a bingo I think. The main idea of DINGY was to try to block an A+VOW bingo.

>Bill_Huttell: FO 7H OF +11 25
>Kevin_Leeds: AAELRSS C9 AREAS +23 55
#note There's REASSA(I)L.  Beyond that, Quackle suggests I play A(VOW)AL or A(VOW)ALS for best results.

>Bill_Huttell: ?AEIPRT 12B P.RAsITE +70 95
>Kevin_Leeds: AEJLRRS B2 JARRE. +32 87
#note I wasn't too thrilled about playing this.  J(A)R or R(A)J is slightly better.  Too focused on scoring points, apparently.  RAJES hooking onto PARASITE+S is there too.


>Bill_Huttell: DIT 13G DIT +17 112
>Kevin_Leeds: EHLMSVW 11I WHELM +32 119
>Bill_Huttell: QT E11 Q.T +24 136
>Kevin_Leeds: ADEILSV N7 VALISED +77 196
#note Let's devise some way to stop thinking this is a word.

>Bill_Huttell: GNR 8L GR.N +21 157
>Kevin_Leeds: AEEIUUZ O13 EAU +12 208
#note I decided to block that hot spot.  MAIZE was there for 40 but not very defensive and kept UU so I didn't like it.  3 ply sim likes U(R)AEI best.

>Bill_Huttell: CM 10M M.C +13 170
>Kevin_Leeds: EIINUUZ -IUU +0 208
#note Quackle suggests PIU B12.
>Bill_Huttell: ADEILNT L1 DELATIN. +74 244
>Kevin_Leeds: EEGINTZ 3B .GENTIZE +90 298
#note Now I've concocted another phony, born of MAGNETIZE and AGENIZE and TZIGANE.  Bill, you should challenge these more often!  It seemed to me like I had seen this one somewhere for sure, so that is why I tried it.  (A)GENIZE was 54 or ZINGE(D) was 54.


>Bill_Huttell: EL H1 LE. +36 280
>Kevin_Leeds: BCEEOOO 1L .ECO +21 319
#note DECO is a pretty good choice. I didn't want Bill to put DEXY there.  BOOTEE is a little better because it balances the rack though.

>Bill_Huttell: ENOX M1 .XON +37 317
>Kevin_Leeds: ABEIOOU K4 BEAU +25 344
#note Here Quackle tells me (many ply sim) that exchange ABIOOU is the same winning percentage (44.5 ish) as the play I chose right away.
#note I misscored it as 20 and Bill corrected it immediately to 25.

>Bill_Huttell: PSU J1 UPS +30 347
>Kevin_Leeds: BFINOOO 4D FOIN +30 374
#note I played this quickly too, glad to find something that used an O and scored nicely.

>Bill_Huttell: ?IORSTU 5B .UST +20 367
>Kevin_Leeds: BKOOY L11 .OOBY +28 402
#note A looby is a large oafish person.  I found two out spots for the K, KEFS or KID.  LOOBY and POKY both show the win in Championship Player although the Many Plies iteration is wrong in Quackle - it shows LOOBY as a 0% win.
