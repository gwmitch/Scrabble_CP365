#note This is quite a complex play, and I'm pretty sure I didn't make the right choice.  I'm not even sure I thought about SKETCHY, although it's still hard to see how I lose after SKETCHY.  I saw SAUTERNE but rejected it because of the bingo-responses, but it turns out that actually my play allows more bingos in response.  I think REUSE is better than URASE, but I think SAUTERNE is the play.
