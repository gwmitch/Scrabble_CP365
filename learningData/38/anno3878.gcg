>Noah_Walton: JLOQRUW G5 JOW. +18 18
#note Quackle likes this best, but with other options trailing closely. (G)ROWL, hoping for big scores in the next two turns, J(E)W keeping a leave which is probably a bit more balanced, and finally L(I)QUOR, which I don't like at all, although it does set up the J, but he spot will probably be taken.

#note Didn't see NA(I)F, which looks to be a smidge better.
>Carl_Johnson: ADEERST J5 SEDATER +77 121
>Noah_Walton: AEEIIPR 11F PRAI.IE +18 122
#note I didn't see A(N)I, which I prefer to this a little bit. Quackle says this is fine, and I think it is too, just ANI might be a slight improvement.
>Carl_Johnson: NNORT H10 N.TRON +21 142
>Noah_Walton: BEIIPTT 13B BITTIE. +20 142
#note Or maybe BITE 12C.

>Noah_Walton: DDGLSTZ F4 Z.G +25 209
#note I thought of G(I)D or D(I)G, but not of (A)DZ for next turn, which makes G(I)D and D(I)G look better.

>Carl_Johnson: EORWY M2 .OWERY +32 323
#note The hammer.
>Noah_Walton: DEIINOS 1N OI +8 246
#note Quackle hates this, with DO(W)IE simming far better. I don't really see anything that is any good here at all, but DOWIE is certainly an improvement, blocking scores (as the next two turns will show) and scoring, and turning over to get the blank.
>Carl_Johnson: AAH L4 AH +25 348
#note He laid down AHA first. I think he might have had the H here as well.
>Noah_Walton: DEINRSV 6D VI... +13 259
#note At this point, it looks completely hopeless. I couldn't find any really brilliant plays that open up creative lanes or hit oodlins of bingos. Maybe V(ET) instead, for a better leave.
>Carl_Johnson: AH N9 AH +30 378
>Noah_Walton: DEENORS B11 D.. +6 265
#note I'm pretty sure it's over by now, but this does do alright. I don't think I have a win here, but the 2/9 chance of NECROSE/ENSORCEL is the best I could think of. In a tourney, this would probably be the best thing when trying for spread. 
>Carl_Johnson: ACMO A8 COMA +27 405
>Noah_Walton: EEKNORS 1H .EEK +21 286
#note Played too fast, and definitely should've played S(L)EEK instead. KERNE(L) is best of all.
>Carl_Johnson: ?EFU 7C FE +16 421
#note Us 14A is best.
>Noah_Walton: NORS 14A OS +18 304
#note Best.
