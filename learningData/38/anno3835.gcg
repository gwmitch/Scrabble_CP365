#note I feel reasonably sure that giving up the equity is correct here even though it feels very intangible.

#note SOUK is better, and there are some board killing plays work considering as well.  I'm not happy with either play because I shouldn't be trying to bingo here but what else can I do?
>Opponent: ADEINNR 5D NARDINE +78 322
#note Definitely prefer 5f.

#note Pretty much over now.

#note I'm really not happy about missing COELOStAT here.  Even though it's a 9 with a blank, for my standards I expect to find that here.  I don't like any of the other board opening plays at all here though, especially against C-player, but even in general they are pretty bad.  
>Opponent: ?AENNRS 6J NAN +9 363
#note Keep living the dream, C-player... you need to fish for SOMETHING.  Probably dropping the N is best here.  Maybe RIN. 
>Kenji: ?CEILOP 14B PO.E +22 409
#note Just a goof.  COLEUs is clearly the play.  I thought EE or BE might lose, but if you actually think about it for a few minutes it becomes obvious there's no way that those plays lose.  Championship Player fails to play COLEUs btw.  But I'm certain it's correct.  Just incapable of simming that many moves...
