>Jason: CDLMORR 8G CORM +16 16
#note G.I. Joel, sitting next to me, paid me a great compliment when he said I wasn't a dipsh*t. (Long story, those in Albany who hung out with Lipe may remember the backstory.)
>Ken_Kasney: IY G7 I.Y +13 13
#note I started the tourney early ... before announcements, which I assumed had been done while I was in the lobby. I blame Alex Fiszbein ... when I looked over and saw him put down his opening play, I assumed we were good. Oops. At this point, we had a few-minute break.
>Jason: ADLORUX F4 DOUX +23 39
#note Duck likes LUX, same spot. I'm surprised. (-1)
>Ken_Kasney: BLO E3 LOB +21 34
>Jason: AEILQRT D2 QAT +34 73
>Ken_Kasney: II -II +0 34
#note I hadn't played a live game in more than a month and was a bit of a space cadet, messing up my tracking/counting three times. Similarly, my handwriting sucked early ... I believe this number I wrote next to "Exch." here is two, but it could be three.
>Jason: AEIILRT J8 .I +4 77
>Ken_Kasney: EIMN F9 MINE +15 49
>Jason: AEILLRT 13B LITERAL +73 150
#note The first bingo of the tourney always feels good, esp. when it gives you a 100-point lead.
>Ken_Kasney: FOP H12 F.OP +39 88
>Jason: AADEIUZ 10I ADIEU +20 170
#note Ooh, ZA(MI)A! (-5)
>Ken_Kasney: DEEK 12A DEKE +34 122
>Jason: AAARRVZ K10 .ZAR +26 196
#note Q likes the setup of V(EL)AR. Didn't see it. (-2)
>Ken_Kasney: FY 12J F.Y +18 140
>Jason: AACORUV J12 .AVA +20 216
>Ken_Kasney: ?ENRSSU K2 UNREStS +71 211
#note Have fun finding Ken's disconnected nine between the P and A.
>Jason: CNOORSU 15J .CORNS +27 243
#note Missed the nine through EL and made a lousy non-bingo play besides. NOC(U)OUS gives me a 60+% win chance, this less than 50%. (-60)
>Ken_Kasney: AEGW A8 WAGE. +30 241
>Jason: EGINOSU 3G ENGI.OUS +74 317
#note The same round, Rafi Stern challenged George Viebranz' ANGINOUS. IGNEOUS/(ADIEU)S loses a few equity points, but the board configuration is better and its win % higher.
>Ken_Kasney: IJN H1 JI.N +36 277
#note I was still a little nervous here. The pool was very balanced, including ?S, and it was easy to see Ken winning with a late bingo.
>Jason: DEIILPT B6 PIED +21 338
#note Missed/didn't know the cool T(R)EPID at 4J. (-17)
>Ken_Kasney: HT 2J H.T +29 306
>Jason: ?ILNRTT C5 LINT +18 356
#note A good draw and the Duck says I'm near-guaranteed to win.
>Ken_Kasney: EOVW N11 WOVE. +22 328
>Jason: ?AAORTT O5 ARnATTO +73 429
#note Earning a "nice play" from Ken and allowing my spread to get off to a good start, esp. since I counted this as 76.
>Jason:  (BEEGH) +22 451
