#note I have TWO TENS on my rack -- PREVENIENT and PREVENTIVE -- and I actually saw the latter. Jesse is an asshole, so he blocks it.
>Evans: ?EEINPT B8 ..P +11 32
#note This and TUNE E6, also a one-tile fish, seem to be my best options. What an annoying board.
>Jesse: U -U +0 102
#note I meant to ask Jesse what this rack was. I forgot. Oops.
>Evans: ?EEINPT 9F NE +13 45
#note I drew the other fucking P! Good lord. I think now's the time to drop the E for TUNE/LAVE -- at the time, I was worried about what that would do to my bingo chances, but it turns out to be best by far for bingoing.
>Jesse: AGM H4 MAG +14 116
#note A bingo lane. Thank God.

#note Typical me... keeping a balanced leave to maximize bingo chances. ID 6M is probably better though... AISST is pretty solid.
>Jesse: AEFIR 13I FERIA +34 296
>Evans: ADEIJST C1 JADE. +28 220
#note Wasn't sure of FERIAE... chickened out on JADES N10 for 67. The other, non-FERIAE play Quackle likes is TAJ 14L, which is cool because it keeps DEIS and opens a nice lane for a high-scoring bingo.
