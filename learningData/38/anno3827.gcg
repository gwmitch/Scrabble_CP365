>Cesar: CILNNSS 8G LINN +8 8
#note i'd normally slap the extra S on but for some reason i didn't like that. i didn't dwell on this enough; LINS is a nice play. (-1)
>Mark: FHOO 9E HOOF +19 19
>Cesar: AACIOSS E8 C.AOS +20 28
#note CHAO or OHIA sim a lot better, now it thinks I should have held back the S :) (-5.5)

>Mark: EIORV K2 VIREO +25 95
>Cesar: ?EIMRSZ K9 MIR +14 69
#note i spent FOREVER on this move, literally more than 10 minutes. the first five minutes were debating whether misprize was good (i saw it immediately) and then deciding that i just couldn't bring myself to play it because i wasn't sure enough. the next five minutes were trying to find something else that was decent! my move isn't that terrible compared to the other non-bingo alternatives it seems, but i gotta play K9 SIZER. i spent so long on this move that i didn't have enough time for the rest of the game! i DID feel like a luckbox and couldn't find anything that worked. if only mark knew about me drawing a blank in the last 8 nationals games or not double-blanking anyone till game 18 of albany.. but i digress. (-22)
>Mark: EIKLNPR H2 AETHER..Y +69 164
>Mark: EIKLNPR --  -69 95
>Cesar: ?ELSSSZ 3J S.ZE +26 95
#note knowing what he had made this especially idiotic (-22.5). 10J SIZE is a million times better, or SIZES there. i didn't want to show what a luckbox i was by playing both Ss. if you want me to play badly just call me a luckbox..

>Mark: EOW N10 WOE +30 179
>Cesar: ABDIIMV 1L VI.D +36 210
#note 4H MBIRA is the play, but i figured i should kill the easier spot.. probably should have looked harder. (-4)

>Cesar: ACDEINR H1 CRI.. +27 319
