#note Maybe exchange DRM or DRH.  I'm open to either play.  Probably like trading a little better but it's close and not that important long term, I think.  Nevertheless, it's still an error.
#note Maybe it does matter...

#note Pretty glad to get rid of the blanks.  I also like how open this board is seemingly looking.

#note JERID is clearly better than TAJ or JADE here.  TAJ closes the board too much, while JADE allows too many easy J plays for my opponent to easily find and cash.  I'm not happy about killing the top right quadrant, but it's better than the other two options.

#note I like my play here.  Quackle's ARAK preference is reasonable but I like my play better.

#note While I could play VETS or something, I want to block all the easy big plays at l1.

#note Not that sure here.  I want to stay in range so that a bingo will still win the game, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of favorable draws.  Then again, there aren't really other plays that look better.

#note I thought recoinages played for a second.  Trying to hit plays like iodinates and other things while outscoring qintar.  Not sure what else I can try and hit.  I think that the IN and G will be blocked.  Two tiles seems best to negate the QI c2 play.  Chances are slim, and hitting the W seems impossible.  Quackle prefers OAT which is a slight improvement.

#note He should probably block IODINATES here.
>Kenji: AEINSTY B2 TINES +23 419
#note Pretty bad but I don't really care.  ELOIN could easily be missed too.  Already kind of bummed knowing I'm going to be 3-2 negative, which is already a devastating day even if I win the next 3 games, even after double blanking my opponent.  FWIW, it would get even worse after this point.
