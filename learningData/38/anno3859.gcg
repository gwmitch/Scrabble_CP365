#note Saw this right away and didn't bother looking for anything else. I saw the possibility of DISVAL(U)E at the top and just went for it. The barista just called out my drink, too. Given that Speedy dumped all 7, I should have expected to draw the last 3 I's (and against an expert, that's what I would draw). PIU or VIGIA might be better under other circumstances.
