#note Last year during round 5 of Arden, I stupidly played WILTY* against Mallick when WORRIT was my best play. Weird how that works out.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEHLNRV D8 H.VEL +28 50
#note Duck gives VEAL, 8A, a slight edge, but I'm with Rob on this one.
>Jason: AEENPRW C11 WAP +23 102
#note Stupidly chickened out on PAWNE(R). And why not PEW? I suck. (-6)
>Rob_Robinsky: ADENORT 8A ODA. +29 79
>Jason: ?EELMNR E11 ELM +25 127
#note Technically not a bingo miss, as it sims better than the only playable through the O. Still should've seen it, though.
>Rob_Robinsky: EEGNRRT 7A GET +18 97
#note GEN, same spot, is a little better.
>Jason: ?EENORT 14D EsTRONE +65 192
#note (M)ENTOREd's only four less and is less volatile. Same for TENONER at 7H. Considered TENOR(IT)Es, too. (-1)
>Rob_Robinsky: CENORRU B12 CUR +20 117
#note Relieved Rob didn't take either triple. A few points behind RERUN, 15H.
>Jason: EFGIIJY H13 J.Y +39 231
>Rob_Robinsky: EINORTV 15A VERT +33 150
#note VEIN instead. More proof Rob's better, he calls this a "bad miss," by my standards it'd be "mildly disappointing".
>Jason: EFGIIUZ B4 FUZ.. +38 269
#note The beginning of the end ... and not just of Rob's unhappiness with how the game had progressed. :)
>Rob_Robinsky: DIINOOO A1 IODIN +29 179
>Jason: EGIINTU 2A .UTING +22 291
#note Missing TIEING, 15J. Thought this was my only decent scoring play. (-5)
>Rob_Robinsky: BCDEKOO 13J BOOK +24 203
>Jason: EIILMNP 14L MINI +22 313
#note Tunnel vision, I think. P(I)LEI at D1 is fine. PILI in this spot is preferred, too. (-2)
>Rob_Robinsky: ACDDESU 1F ADDUCES +89 292
>Jason: AEIILLP O12 PA.L +27 340
#note I think I panicked here ... too obsessed with grabbing points to avoid being outrun. ILIA, same spot, is preferred. PLIE here is better too, I think ... forgot I was setting up an S hook. (-7)
>Rob_Robinsky: BEENNOR D1 B.NE +18 310
#note Highest valuation, but (Y)EN wins a little more often.
>Jason: AEEIILO 3F AIOLI +11 351
#note (N)AOI, 3D. Apparently my board vision went to pot here. (-6)
>Rob_Robinsky: AAEFNOR 4H FA +20 330
#note Sim likes. Rob admits there may be a better play ... this has too low a valuation to be on CP's radar, but he (and I) like it better than Q's choices.
>Jason: AEEEHOS C1 A.E +14 365
#note We took a long look at the pre-endgame afterward, esp. this play. Rob saw CP's clear favorite, which I did not: OHS at 12J for 32. OHS is at 84%, this at 64%, and HOE at E4, which I almost played, is at 55%. Given Rob's rack and the fact that AGTX is in the bag, OHS wins the 3/4 times I pick the T. Annoying is that HOE also wins the 3/4 times I pick the T after Rob's (O)Y X-bomb block. (-10)
>Rob_Robinsky: AENORSY L12 Y.. +16 346
#note The five Y fishes are the top five plays, says CP. Win percentages fluctuate, but Q seems to like other plays like (LA)Y. Can't really explain why ... I assume that Duck wants Rob to keep the S- hook to PAIL open. I like scoring though; Rob draws the X and he may win a race.
>Jason: EEGHOSX I6 HOS. +20 385
#note OK, it's safe to assume Rob drew into six of AENORST, and not SANTOR (He'd have had AROYNTS). Low on time, I tried to see if there was any combination Rob had where I could block all playable bingos. If he drew A into ORATES, I saw one spot for AEROSAT, so played this to block. Then realized it's no good. Then thought a "pass" wouldn't be bad here ... maybe Rob's forced to bingo and set up a huge X play. (Also gives him another chance to fish, doofus.) FWIW (not much), equity loss here is about 21, giving Rob ES. Decided to input Rob's actual leave ... GOXES (which I almost played, and should've) leads. No sense blocking, just hope he doesn't have it. This stupidity X-sticks myself. With no inference, CP likes GES(S)O, CHIGOE, CHIGOES or GOX ... I guess I was right to try to block AEROSAT. Bad to miss GOX. Got to stop panicking when short on time in situations like this.
