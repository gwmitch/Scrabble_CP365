>Sam: BILNOOR H1 BORON +32 54
>Mike_Wolfberg: ACV G4 VAC +20 34
>Sam: CEILNUU 6A NUCLEI. +15 69
#note NUCLEIC* what!!! Not a good play anyway. Quackle's top play of Ex. U is sorta cool, CEILNU hits w/ exactly 50% of the unseen pool. It seems unlikely he will block 9A bingoes as well. 
>Mike_Wolfberg: AFRSZ K4 ZARFS +46 80
>Sam: ABEIORU L1 OBIA +36 105
>Mike_Wolfberg: EOO 2K O.OE +12 92
>Sam: EIORTUU A1 TURIO. +21 126
#note Should have seen OUTRUN. Quackle's top play of ROUTINE A1 is...silly. 
>Mike_Wolfberg: EL 1H .EL +5 97
>Sam: EIMOTUY D3 MOT.EY +30 156
#note Didn't notice MULEY, but this is fine.

#note Phony
>Mike_Wolfberg: EHISV M4 SHIVE +27 178
>Sam: AAEILPR 12A PI.A +18 229
#note Should have given more of a thought to PA 1N given SHIVE, though he might not have an S. Also no reason to be scared of PIAL, really. PINA isn't really bad though.
>Mike_Wolfberg: HTU A12 .HUT +27 205
>Sam: ?AEELMR 13C .LEAMiER +66 295
#note Embarrassing. TRAMELEd, TELEgRAM, TELEMARk!! The last is harder to find but the first two should have been gimmes.
>Mike_Wolfberg: ESTX H11 EX.ST +57 262
>Sam: ?DEEPRY N8 REPaYED +88 383
#note Phony. A few plays win 100%, like YES 14F. If Mike had challenged it off and then bingoed I would have had to find DEEPRTY?.
