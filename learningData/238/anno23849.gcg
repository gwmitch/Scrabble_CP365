#note Jason said he probably would have challenged REIMITATE* if it didn't give him his own bingo

>Mack: ?ACDLSW 13F D.wCLAWS +82 254
#note Didn't want to risk playing REIMITATES* and DeCLAWS, which was a smart decision since Jason said afterward he would have challenged this time. 12A WiLDCATS is 4 more but this is much better defensively.

#note Quackle says O1 SHOE. I like this play since it basically forces Jason to bingo through the A on row 11, and if he does he will often give me back a big play on the left side.
>Jason: OW 6J WO. +29 293
>Mack: EHOSSTT O1 THO +25 340
>Jason: BEINRU 14A BURNIE +25 318
>Mack: EEIISST H12 I.IS +15 355
#note Tough call between this and 15A IS, it seemed to me that Jason would have an easier time scoring on row 15 than column A with the pool unseen. Quackle likes IWIS also.
>Jason: MO 15A OM +28 346
>Mack: EEGLSTU 4C GU. +14 369
#note Jason is almost definitely not bingoing with the unseen pool, so with such a strong leave I may as well give myself the best chance to bingo myself as I can. Quackle likes K1 PUG, but I feel the open G benefits me more than him, so I like my play.
>Jason: FO 2J FO. +34 380
>Mack: DEELSTZ C9 ZESTE. +50 419
>Jason: ?ABDNOX -  +0 380
#note Jason was pretty sure ZESTER was good but challenged as he can only win if it comes off the board.
