#note Considered this, M9 WETTER, and exchanging. I've got a good chance of drawing 11E QAT next turn, or maybe one of the 3 remaining Us, so WAGER seemed worth it.

#note Quackle likes 4K WEFT, the other play I considered, a bit better. I knew Karl didn't keep an I last turn or else he would have played TIMING, so I wasn't too worried about the N2 spot, and I didn't want to be stuck with the Q any longer, but I do have a very good shot at N10 QIS or O1 QATS after WEFT, so it seems a bit better in hindsight.

#note 13A DePONENT, which I saw, is 8 more points, but I'd rather go up 20 on a closed board after this than risk a big J play or, worse, a bingo on the elft side after DePONENT. Quackle is not a fan at all, but I'm fine with it.
