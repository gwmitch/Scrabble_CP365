>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: AEIVWWY H8 VIEWY +36 36
#note MC: First time to play against Mack. Given my standing in the tournament right now, I know it'll matter too. Here we go!

MM: In most positions I'd opt for an open board, but I liked playing VIEWY here and closing the board off with the V since I'm already jumping off to a 36 point lead and leaving him limited comeback options
>Matt_Canik: EEGMNOU G9 GNOME +30 30
#note MC: My matchup plan was definitely to try and play a closed board, and I couldn't really have asked for a better sequence to get there 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: ADIIMNW 11D WID.. +24 60
>Matt_Canik: AAEEEKU 12A AKEE +28 58
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: ?AEIIMN 8H .ItAMINE +95 155
#note MC: Welp so much for closing it off. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEFJLU B10 JU.ED +66 124
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: ADEHLOS 14G SHOALED +72 227
>Matt_Canik: ACFLQUY 7M QUA +47 171
#note MC: Spent several minutes trying to decide which placement of QUA ends up helping more in getting this board back to an open state after the bingo-bango. I decided that it hurts in the short run to block the E but it helps in the long run- there's almost no way to sufficiently open up the top/left sides of the board after QUA 7I, but with the 7M placement I can make plays forming A(QUA) and open, and plays at 7I can still lead to threatening openings most of the time. 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: ?PRRSUX L12 PR.X +42 269
#note MM: Also considered 13A REX, but wanted to prevent big plays at 15L.
>Matt_Canik: ACEFLOY 15H OY +35 206
#note This over OF in the same spot because I'm holding FLA(R)E next turn for 47. 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: ?CEERSU I4 EUCR.tES +79 348
#note Luckmack Luckiel Luckthaniel Luckler
>Matt_Canik: AACEFLL H1 CALF +48 254
#note But I don't get to play it! The C at 1H seems extra threatening to form high-scoring and harder-to-block bingos (or at least harder to block without scoring like 10), plus it can be played to or from. 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: AELRTTV J2 VAT +20 368
#note MM: Mostly closing off rows 1 and 2 while scoring well and keeping a good leave. VERT in the same spot is another solid option, but E's were becoming scarce so I opted for this.
>Matt_Canik: AELPTTZ 13I TZA. +34 288
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: EEGLORT 15K E.ERT +42 410
#note I asked Mack politely to stop scoring so many points after this play. Thankfully, he obliged. Perhaps I've discovered the secret to beating Mack Meller!


>Matt_Canik: AEGHLPT K4 ALPH. +27 315
#note At this point I look dead, but I did notice the coolish possibility of fishing a G for a B to surprise him with ALPH(A)BET/(FET)A for 117. When spread still very much matters though, I think I just play to keep it close now. I didn't know PELHA(M), which is probably right here. 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: DGILNOU 2J .ULGO +18 428
#note MM: I could have played L1 DIOL for 12 more but I wanted to still be Matt's friend after the game so tried to comply with his polite request to score less. 

(Actually, I flat out missed it :) )
>Matt_Canik: AEGINST 1N GI +12 327
#note I must be really bad at opening boards if none of the 8 7s or 37 8s in this rack are available..... 
>Mack_Daniel_Nathaniel_Meller: BDIIINO 6D BIONI. +12 440
#note MM: 3M OBI doesn't give him the I to bingo through so probably saves me a little spread
>Matt_Canik: AENORST E1 NOTAR.ES +66 393
