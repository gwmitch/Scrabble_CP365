#note Don't like giving back the AVOWED hook but this is too much better than anything else.

#note 4I ABULIA looks slightly better, 15 points is too much to give up even with the better leave.

#note Weird rack. This looks as good as anything.

>Mack: ?CDEQUY 5D DYE +29 330
#note Ddidn't like 13B QUEY because of the imbalanced leave, and DYE gives me a good shot at plays like 12A QUIRT among other things next turn.
>Michael: FI 10I IF +28 303
>Mack: ?CNQRRU 13C CR. +16 346
#note Didn't consider burning the blank with 12A QUiRT. The problem with CRY and plays like N7 CURR is that they only leave one area of the board for bingoing, so if Michael bingoes I'm in big trouble. In hindsight I think QUiRT is probably bit better, since it leaves me up a tempo if he bingoes and allows me to close the right side of the board next turn if he doesn't.

#note I can't play INVeRTOR since Michael almost definitely has an S after all the fishing plays he's been making. And I want to play as few tiles as possible to minimize my chances of drawing the Q, W, and X. This bingoes on the right since with any vowel and several consonants, and seems as good as anything to me.
