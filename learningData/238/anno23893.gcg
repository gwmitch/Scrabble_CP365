>Michael_Fagen: IIJNNOS 8D JINNI +40 40
#note This is an example of tilt affecting how I play against Michael.
>Joshua_Sokol: CCDIQRU C5 CURD +22 22
#note Glad to have seen this play. It sets my Q up nicely, and allows me to play CI(N)Q if nothing else, or QI. It also creates a board I am comfortable with against Michael, where equity plays a smaller role than usual. Apparently, this play is horrible.
>Michael_Fagen: FO 9D OF +19 59
#note The result of my play worked out great, and it may not be for nothing.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CIKNQT 6B Q.ICK +50 72
#note Probably among the best draws I could hope for!
>Michael_Fagen: BHO 10B HOB +28 87
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEINNT B10 .ENBIT +22 94
#note Missing the new (JOB)BIE! 
>Michael_Fagen: DDEISTU 11D STUDIED +81 168

>Michael_Fagen: ?EEHLOY 14H EYEHOLe +80 248
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIIIPS -III +0 216
#note jesus christ what an awful draw! Seemed to be between exchanging III or M12 PI(L)I. I felt PILI did not decrease his average score at all, and definitely decreased mine by over 12. Both of those things are true
>Michael_Fagen: AFRT 15L FART +45 293
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIMPSU 10F MAP +30 246
#note This was a play that I should never have made. I must learn not to tilt so much against Michael, as these positions are crucial.

#note Phony, as suspected. Needed to try it though.
>Michael_Fagen: EOSWY O1 YOWES +43 388
#note assuming he drew OWY. Ugh
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIMTUV 5J MAUV.. +22 376
>Michael_Fagen: ALNRSTV 8M L.V +18 406
#note Michael didn't know SALVER. I did, and saw it, but I knew he would not. Still, this play is better, and wins with every draw. Was hoping he would not end up playing it, but he did, and hats off.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIOTZ 6I DIET +20 396
#note No way to win, unless he misses ZOI(C), or misses my out of DIET while also simultaneously missing/not being sure of TAR(Z)ANS and RATANS. Which was more likely, I don't know. He also wins after ZOI(C) 7 other ways, where after this play he has 15 wins, all involving blocking ZOI(C).
