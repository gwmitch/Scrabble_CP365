>Will: EEERSTY J8 EYE +19 19
#note I need to beat Lloyd two out of three going into this game because I was at 14 and decent spread and he was at 15 and minimal spread. This is certainly a risky option but gets me the bingo faster than anything other than 9F YE or something.

#note Not a fan of FAVA, CP's pick. Horrible board for bingos and no guarantees I even get one decent tile to play through after FAVA.

#note Or FOAM leaving PEACH, but I figured the extra 10 points were worth it now, and I'm likely to do even better next turn.

#note Didn't think of ZOIC extensions to score much better, but ENDOZOIC doesn't seem like a play that I can win with. After JOLTED and an AZOIC opening I can draw bingos in two spots a lot.

>Will: AENNNOT 10M AN +20 350
#note A regular sim (which is obviously not the way to go here for analysis) says I bingo 80 percent of the time after NOON. Unless they play in two spots that seems absolutely insane. I suppose the problem is that Lloyd is so likely to bingo himself with the unseen tiles. Given the game/tourney situation I'm fine with my play.
