#note I'm missing my scoresheet from round 6 (vs. Wes E.) so that game is not uploaded. Despite a great effort by Wes, the drawing was too heavily lopsided in my favor for him to come back (I did get to play dOOmSD(AY)S though :) ).  Meanwhile I am off to an absurdly lucky start here too...

#note It didn't sink in that he played WEFTING* and not WAFTING until I had written the play down on my scoresheet, long after he drew his tiles... oopsies
