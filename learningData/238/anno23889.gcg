#note I didn't like the PP leave after WRONG, but PNG is hardly any better.

>JD: EGNOPRT 7E GO.P +15 33
#note weak play, did not realize PONGY was now good. Even PORGY is much better. not sure why I was so desperate to hold onto the N. Also intrigued that this rack is a trongle (no 7s or 8s, even in CSW)

#note he showed LOGY/PROWL but then played off the J instead.
>JD: AAEEINZ I13 ZEE +54 156
>Darrell_Day: GLVY C8 GYV. +15 105
#note holding an L still. he almost chose to block column J somehow.

#note I have drawn this rack 3 times in the last two weeks and never once realized AMNESIA was playable from it...there are no words

#note I saw the potential danger of the BOOK-EBOOK-REBOOK sequence, but too many points to pass up and I'm holding an E at least.
>Darrell_Day: ?IIILST M5 ILeITIS +63 235
>JD: AELNOTT L8 TALON +21 320
#note I felt compelled to block 8L, but all the power tiles are gone so I can get away with blocking column B now with something like TONLET. I considered LATTE but passed it up.

>JD: DEFINSU 3A F.UED +18 371
#note there's still a fair chance of darrell bingoing on column N, but I should be able to riposte with a scoring play. another smart move is FINE at C1, which lets me score from the F in response to a bingo.
>Darrell_Day: D 10L ..D +8 303
>JD: EEEINST O6 TENESI +23 394
#note I felt great about this play at the time, but this is actually a fairly serious error because INCISOR and IONISER still fit at N1 for a lot of points and threaten to win the game for him. The odds are 33/36 of me winning in a vacuum, but his leave is presumably very strong and my real odds are potentially more like 75%. the correct move is just TINES at O6 which still outruns DIOCESAN and MINORCAS. 20/20 hindsight, lesson learned.
>Darrell_Day: ?CEIORS -  +0 303
#note he challenged.

#note last game of a long day - imperfect end, but will take the win.
