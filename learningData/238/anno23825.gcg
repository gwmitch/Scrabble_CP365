>Will: DEGNOOT 8F GOOD +12 12
#note Weird choice, I usually do moves like NOODGE.

>Scott: EGT 5C GET +20 45
>Will: AEEENOV 9H EAVE +14 66
#note Every fiber of my being said to do something like VEGA after Scott's first two plays, but I couldn't manage to do it. I dunno, this doesn't seem so terrible, maybe?

>Scott: ABILS 1A ABS.IL +24 159
>Will: FIILNPR 4I FI.RIL +22 126
#note I saw PILI and quickly discarded it but it seems pretty reasonable. Also FIBRIN > FIBRIL, LP is more synergistic.
>Scott: ?AINSTT A1 .TTAINtS +74 233
>Will: DNNPRYZ 6J P.NNY +24 150
#note Hoping for IZARD and that Scott doesn't notice that I could've played this in a more open way for 28. I did notice that Scott opted against playing FIBRILS, but I assumed he would have played it if he had had to, and the OES hook was still there too. No point in leaving it open.
>Scott: CHIP 3G CHIP +25 258
>Will: DEELRYZ 1A ......ED +33 183
#note Only YEH among the top options preserves both the IZARD spot and all the letters for it, but it only gives me two cracks at an A. 3M LEZ sets up YEZ and actually retains a leave with a semblance of promise. Tough call.
>Scott: AEEGO 11H GOA.EE +7 265
>Will: ?ELRSYZ H11 .YRES +39 222
#note Couldn't bring myself to burn all of my ammo with IZARS, but I'm sad to say I didn't consider GLaZY keeping ERS. Still, GYRES at least offers some good shots at SLEAZ- plays from the S that score a ton with LZ? in my leave. It's CP's pick by a fair margin of win%.
>Scott: JO 14F JO. +26 291
>Will: ?AILUXZ 3L AX +38 260
#note Interestingly, taking 20 fewer points for 7A TUX or 12M XU sims a smidge ahead of AX for 38 - I can still get all the SLEAZ- bingos as well as REALIZE or RURALIZE type bingos from the R in row 13 after TUX. Interesting. Also, keeping the U is hazardous...

>Will: ?CEILNR 12A pRINCEL. +74 368
#note Time running low, so I threw this down and hoped for the best. A waiting move like COL or maybe COR 3C is far superior. If Scott has the Q I need him not to have QUERY or QUEUER. If he doesn't I need to avoid it or draw QU and then get lucky that he doesn't block the right place. Either way, it's gonna be hard to win...but it's very hard to see how it could happen after PRINCELY.
