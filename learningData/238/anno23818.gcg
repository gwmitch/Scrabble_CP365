#note Lloyd seemed close after OWN so I tried to block bingos as best I could. I kept OR so I could play GRAZER/RHO next turn and not open any more.

#note RHEA blocks this, of course...
>Will: EIOOPRV F14 PO +20 300
#note I was so close to doing the right thing here and playing long. First off I'm losing and probably need JXSS and I'm going to want to play tiles to get them. Secondly, the RAJ spot at 2A is basically impossible to block without sacrificing a turn and the X spot isn't much better. Also, I have an I in hand and only two are unseen, whereas four A's are unseen, meaning it's slightly more common for Lloyd to have the X and no way to play it than it is for him to have the J and no way to play it. All this to say I screwed up here and probably need to play DEVOIR/LOVIER or maybe even PERVO 5J...or POOVE L2 holding an I in case I get the X. Just not what I played.

>Will: EIORRVX L3 VEX.R +30 330
#note If this didn't give Lloyd such a guaranteed high scoring response hitting the X, it might be a good option to go for the esses and try to hit a big play of my own. As it is I think the 20+% bingo chance Quackle things I have after LOX is unrealistic - it seems impossible that he would let the E at L6 stay open and with my RIVER leave I can only hit STRIVER using the STEAM hook if I draw an S.
>Lloyd: NO K4 NO. +26 372
>Will: EEFIORS 8L SEIF +41 371
#note Here Quackle thinks I win 46 percent after 14J DOE...seems a bit ambitious again. First off Lloyd bingos a lot (about 25%) and every time that happens I lose. Next, when he doesn't, he probably successfully manages to block the DOE hook and forces me to have SNIFTER or SIFTERS with STEAM. It's true that I set up my F in a nice way after DOE but it's not going to be enough with only one-pointers to pair it with.
