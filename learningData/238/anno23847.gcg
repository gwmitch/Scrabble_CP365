#note I like this play, it scores as well as anything and leaves Sal very few options while giving myself an S hook
>Sal: EL 4J .EL +13 64
>Mack: AEHKMNS 3K HANK +33 80
#note Sal may very well have an S at this point, but this is so much better than anything else that is has to be correct
>Sal: EINORST O3 STONIER +86 150
>Mack: BEMNSVW N8 NEWB +21 101
#note Can't understand why Quackle likes N5 WEB, that keeps an even more imbalanced leave while closing down my best bingo lane and not giving myself an S hook

#note Definitely not playing through with a 13L play, if I can get a good play at O11 I'll be right back in this game

#note 6A OW scares me with the 3 unseen Is, and I like keeping the PA and AB open for 9s while Sal will likely be distracted with the W I just opened
