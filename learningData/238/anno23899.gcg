#note Missed ADOZE.  Worth it!  Held and released.

#note ENTAMES is two more.  Hook held and released, too.
>John_Bulten: GMNOU L3 MUNGO +30 160
>Ryan_Fischer: AACPTWX 14I AX +52 251
#note Not WAX or TAX 'cause it gives too much back.
>John_Bulten: AEILLNR 15C RALLINE +77 237
#note See?  Coulda been much worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACCPTVW J5 TWA +41 292
#note Didn't want to play VAW or CAW because that would really mess up the top of the board, and it's too close to do that.
>John_Bulten: RTY M1 TRY +26 263
>Ryan_Fischer: CCEGOPV 12J V.E +29 321
#note CO(RALLINE).  Whoa.  And here I was thinking ECCO was just a dolphin from a 90s video game.  Nice to see my play is 3rd staticly.
>John_Bulten: NNU M7 NUN +19 282
>Ryan_Fischer: CCEGLOP N3 CLOG +21 342
#note Still CO(RALLINE).

>Ryan_Fischer: BCEEKPY A12 .ECK +33 375
#note I saw BECKE(T), didn't think it was an actual word.  Heh.  (G)YBE is better, too.
>John_Bulten: AQT 7E QAT +32 343
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEFIPY 1M .YE +18 393
#note BEPI(T)Y, the quality of being BEP, is second.  ABY first.  Neither is really great.  (T)YE doesn't really rank, probably because the leave is just atrocious.  But I needed to score and block.

>John_Bulten: ?DEFIOO --  -72 343
>Ryan_Fischer: ABFIPST F6 F.. +13 406
#note I have the last A.  Set it up.  It's probably not too smart though because he has the blank, but I know his rack which makes it less dangerous.
>John_Bulten: ?DEFIOO 12F OOF +25 368
>Ryan_Fischer: ABIPSTT 5E TAB +16 422
#note Best.
>John_Bulten: ?DEEIIR 4B RIDE +12 380
