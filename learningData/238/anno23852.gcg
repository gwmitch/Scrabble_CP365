>Mack: BEFHLTV H7 F..BLE +17 134
#note Seemed barely worth it over exchanging. I don't mind opening up the board since I'm barely winning anyway. Quackle likes 10G BLET keeping FHV which seems insane to me.

#note Not thrilled with blowing the board open at this point, but I have nothing else that scores and I'm not up enough to justify not bingoing.

#note Thankfully talked myself out of NUCELIDE*, mixed up NUCLIDE and NUCLEOID

#note Let's go defense!

#note I could play A1 AT to block Lloyd's D setup, but it seemed silly since I win anyway if he bingoes after this.
