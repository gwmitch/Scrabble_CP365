#note This is the top static play but I only played it because I thought I had the last S and all the remaining I's. Sure, why not add mistracking to the list of things I did wrong. JINNI, the other play I considered, is far superior.

#note Pretty thoroughly demoralized after this game, the Gibson game, and the two Lloyd games earlier in the day. However, I was somehow still right in the thick of things and I had a chance to right the ship.
