#note Put down APO and then picked it up for AGO...APO might be better here because all the -ING bingos I draw go down at 7A. Sad to say I missed GOJI entirely, but I'm not seeing that it's much better if at all than the 15A plays. Not that I saw this whatsoever, but I did have the GOL required for GOLDBRICKED - no good play leaves those letters, though.
>Jesse: AY K10 AY +25 295
>Will: EILLNNP 12C NILL +18 324
#note Hmm. Tough call here. Jesse is clearly close, and NILL is a do-nothing play that leaves him all of his bingo lanes. It looks better to play D11 LIPIN, opening a couple new lanes that are unlikely to allow him bingos he couldn't play already, and then try to make a play that blocks rows 7 and 9 on my next turn.
>Jesse: AAU 3J AU.A. +10 305
>Will: DEHNPRU 12L H.. +20 344
#note HIN bingos a lot, but not quite enough to make up an 18 point difference from 11D HEP.
>Jesse: AEOPSTZ 4D TOPAZES +108 413
>Will: DEGNPRU 1F RED....... +60 404
>Will: DEGNPRU --  -60 344
#note Maybe an over-reaction to TOPAZES but I thought there was some chance this might be good, and since it's probably getting challenged every time it's a huge swing in win%.
>Jesse: BM G7 M.B +13 426

#note Blocking the good Q dump and hoping for UNROPED 5A.
>Jesse: EW 5E WE +24 450
>Will: DENOPRU 6D REP +30 379
#note I drew it! But Jesse wisely blocked. I'm running out of time here again.
