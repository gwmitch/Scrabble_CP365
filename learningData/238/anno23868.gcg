#note intentional phony, but THALI is fine and might even draw a challenge, which this won't. Other plays are available, like WHILE or WHEAL at 5H, or GALILEE to set my H up.

#note Somewhat intentional phony here too. BRACTED is good, but I didn't think that BRACT was a verb. Lucky to get this past, as it scores 98 points!

>Joshua_Sokol: AAOQRUY 14H .AY +30 362
#note No real way to block SEDATIONS, so I'm hoping to outscore it somehow I should have gotten rid of my Q this turn with L9 AQUA.
>Ella_Sobel: ?AEMNOR 2H OARsMEN +73 323
#note Realizing she didn't play to SEDATIONS. I assumed she missed it this turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: AMOQRUU 1K AMOUR +44 406
#note Scored this as 42, so for the rest of the game I am underscored by 2. I might have wanted to play MAQU(I) L11 instead, since the Q really isn't conducive to this pool. This ended up being a costly mistake! Champ player thinks I should actually play 1L ARUM for 14 less just to keep my O!
>Ella_Sobel: ?BEERST 13H .B +16 339
#note She missed SEDATIONS again, unbeknownst to me, although I had my doubts.
>Joshua_Sokol: CNNQRUW N12 CUR. +12 418
#note Against a perfect opponent this play is silly, as there are bingos available with most of the unseen pool, but they are just very tough to see. She had just over 4 minutes to find one. But this draw really, really scared me. Being able to block SEDATIONS with the C was huge, though, so it could have been far worse.
>Ella_Sobel: ?EERSST N1 ..TRESSEd +60 399
>Ella_Sobel: ?EERSST --  -60 339
#note I saw UNDERSETS for her, luckily she played its phony anagram or I was toast! 
>Joshua_Sokol: ENNPQTW C7 Q. +21 439
#note Played this quickly enough, hoping she would miss UNDERSETS again, but this outran it anyway.
>Ella_Sobel: ?EERSST K4 RESiTES +76 415
#note But wait!!! This was available too! I didn't see that possibility, but Ella saw it a turn too late. Since I was 2 points behind the real score, this ended in a tie. I quickly took to recounting it and found my mistake. Ella was completely beside herself after losing here, because she knew it was her game to win. As did I. Two big phonies and a hasty desperation phony on her end later, and she loses to a recount. Hopefully that will not happen to her again. I do not wish this upon anyone... But what a game!

Ella actually doubted SEDATIONS for some reason in her past turns, which explains a lot.
