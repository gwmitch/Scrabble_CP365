#note normally I might play short out of this rack but AENT is not really that great.

#note good thing for me he missed atheling.
>JD: ABGPRVZ B10 Z.G +33 125
#note VIRGA was exactly the kind of play I needed but couldn't come up with. I was feeling kinda tired. holding the Z would be really nice.

>JD: ?DIPRUV 5G V..ID +18 169
#note tough play wih no great options. it migt be worth opening a little more by playing PUD.
>Ron_Gideons: AENW F6 WA.E +29 148
>JD: ?IOPRRU 4J POUR +19 188
#note I felt like I was more or less in control of this game at this point. however, chickening out of REPOUR here would prove to be relaly costly. it still doesn't look like a word to me.

>JD: ?EINNRT 13F IN.RaNET +68 256
#note RETENTION is a couple more points.
>Ron_Gideons: ?AFNPSY N7 FrYPANS +78 280
#note this is a really nice play! I almost challenged.
>JD: EGIOOOR L9 GOOI.R +14 270
#note I should still have an edge but my post-bingo draw here didn't let me take advantage of the big opening. I played GOOIER tomake sure I took out the 8L spot.
>Ron_Gideons: ASUV 14A VAUS +25 305
>JD: EIMOQRT C9 MO. +27 297
#note I could also just dump the Q now.

#note argh just trying to reel him in
>Ron_Gideons: CLOO E5 LOC. +25 350
#note he needs to stop making plays like this!
>JD: EILMRRU 3L MERL +20 330
#note I was pretty much stumped at this point. the best winning chance I ould come up with was to set up a bingo lane on row 2 if I draw an E...but that seems totally wrong now. I mught as well just play MURRE or RULIER. it's hard to get exact numbers, but I think I gave up a significant amount of winning chnces here.
>Ron_Gideons: CTU O1 CU.T +21 371
>JD: AEIIKRU G11 .I. +11 341
#note I'm pretty happy with this play - fish for KAURIES.
>Ron_Gideons: ABDEEOS 2K BES +13 384
#note this is a pretty cute setup.
>JD: AEIIKRU D3 KIER +24 365
>Ron_Gideons: ADEO 1H ODEA +19 403
#note this was another game where I had a lot of tough choices and didn't always find a great option. In the middle it felt as though I was powerless to keep up.
