>jd: DINNRTW 8G WIND +16 16
#note Lester is by far my most-played opponent. I hope we get to play lots more.
>Lester_Schonbrun: CIKY K5 ICKY +38 38
>jd: CDNOORT 4H CONDO +37 53
#note it seemed worthwhile to set up the hook, doesn't make a huge difference one way or the other
>Lester_Schonbrun: ADEVW 9D WAVED +22 60
>jd: EORTTUU E5 OUTR.TE +28 81
#note this looks ugly but no other option is really close.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AAGZ 8A GAZA. +54 114
>jd: AAFNPTU D11 FAUNA +23 104
#note faun did not occur to me - but quackle still likes tacking on the A. I guess the board s wide opn as is
>Lester_Schonbrun: FLOT 15A FLO.T +24 138
>jd: AGLNPTT F2 PLANT +21 125
#note keeping a vowel and sacrificing some points does pretty well too (PLAT, PUTT)
>Lester_Schonbrun: EIOOPRS 2C POR.OISE +64 202
#note nice find!
>jd: EGIIOST 1H OI +14 139
#note I am a big underdog by now...I figure play here to prevent getting wiped out and try to bingo as soon as possible.
>Lester_Schonbrun: OUY 1A YOU +22 224
>jd: AEGINST M1 TEASING +79 218
#note another lucky break
>Lester_Schonbrun: BEEV B11 BEVE. +20 244
>jd: ?DEHLNT F11 HELD +21 239
#note he blocked my bingo. I debated getting aggressive and playing somthing like HEN, holding the case T - but with two esses and a blank unseen I felt there was a fair chance he would have one of them, an that I might as well bide my time. NTH or UPHELD may both be better.
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?AEEHIS G12 HIE +18 262
#note I thought this signaled an S.
>jd: ?ABNRST N1 ARB +20 259
#note given what happened after I had dismissed this as a bad play - but quackle actually likes it a lot. since so few As are left, it is hard for me to get absolutely killed at this spot (although I am setting up the J and the X for easy points. that said, I need a lane pretty badly.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AEEEILR O1 REAL +32 294
#note I thought they were all going down! I think he said his leave was EEI.
>jd: ?MMNRST D5 MM +16 275
#note I'm in quite a bit of trouble now, although quackle still puts my winning chances in the mid-30s...however, that doesn't factor in the plethora of scoring tiles remaining. also, I missed scooting MM up one spot.
>Lester_Schonbrun: IX H14 XI +38 332
>jd: ?INRSST 15H .NSISTeR +74 349
#note lucky draw bails me out - but quackle suggests maybe not bingoing!! I have no idea what to think. Suggestions?
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?EEEIJQ N10 JEEpI. +54 386
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?EEEIJQ --  -54 332
#note interestingly enough this is actually his winning play in collins if he makes the blank an L - I remember thinking that at the time and saying, goodness, what if it's ours? but when he made the blank a P I knew I was safe.
