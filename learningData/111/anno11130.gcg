>Matt_Canik: AADOVYZ 8G DAVY +22 22
#note Cool, this is actually better than DOZY. 
>Oliver_Roeder: ?BEIOSU I5 BOU.IErS +64 64
>Matt_Canik: ACEORUZ J2 ZOEA +37 59
#note I spent 7 minutes on this turn trying to decide between OOZE 6H 33, ZOEA J2 37, and AZURE J1 38. Sitting there, I was in a moral dilemma- I never make plays like AZURE slotting the A in the 3x3, but I knew that Quackle would like it better. I just couldn't do it. 
>Oliver_Roeder: EEEIR H11 EERIE +22 86
>Matt_Canik: CDHIPRU 3I P.UCH +30 89
#note For some reason I thought POUCH scored 36, so I played it, then realized it was only 30. Given the new information, HUP is a better play. 
>Oliver_Roeder: AEJLO L3 .AJOLE +32 118
>Matt_Canik: DEEEIRT J2 ....E +20 109
#note Well this is just silly. REEDITE(D). Fail.
>Oliver_Roeder: ?AIOR M5 OI +13 131
#note He showed the blank laying down a bingo down the G line, then picked it up and played OI. I don't know his full rack. 
>Matt_Canik: DEEIORT 9K ODE +22 131
#note Quackle wants me to play DOE/CAJOLED. I guess holding the R makes it a better play even with 4 unseen Rs and 3 unseen esses. I still stick with my play. 
>Oliver_Roeder: ?ABIMRU N8 BARIUMs +79 210
#note HERBARIUM is a cool 9. It's also a filthy extension to BARIUM. 
>Matt_Canik: EIIPRST G3 RIPTI.ES +64 195
#note I saw STRIPIER, but for some reason got in my head that it was Collins only. Which is weird, because I never study Collins. But I thought I remembered seeing it marked # somewhere. Bleh. 

To all of you people who note Collins words to me: STOP. THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO ME. 
>Oliver_Roeder: EITW O5 WITE +33 243
>Matt_Canik: GOQRRTX 12L RO.X +38 233
>Oliver_Roeder: AGY F9 YAG +18 261
>Matt_Canik: AGILQRT F2 QAT +36 269
>Oliver_Roeder: DV 14G V.D +7 268
>Matt_Canik: GIILNRT K3 .RN +37 306
#note GIILT seems pretty unappealing, but then when you note that there are still FIVE unseen Ns, it looks a lot nicer. And this is 37!!! 

I think this is the most the two tiles NR have ever been played for on their own. 
>Oliver_Roeder: FU 11D FU. +14 282
>Matt_Canik: EGIILLT 12E TIL.. +15 321
#note I couldn't tell if his last two plays were fishes or just working through consonants. I wasn't taking any chances though. I guess if I had better analyzed the pool, I would have seen that there are very few bingo possibilities. 

Was again allured by the IG leave with 5 unseen Ns. 
>Oliver_Roeder: ANRT 2B TRAN. +28 310
>Matt_Canik: EGILMNS C1 G.EMLINS +74 395
#note Cool.
>Oliver_Roeder: DFHLNOS 2M OF +15 325
>Matt_Canik: AEHKNOT 1L KNOT +50 445
#note Cool!
>Oliver_Roeder: CDGLNNS 6A CL.NG +10 335
>Matt_Canik: AAEHW 8A WA.H +42 487
#note I put down CHAW, then right before I hit my clock I changed it to WASH without thinking about it opening his out. 
>Oliver_Roeder: DNS B8 .NDS +9 344
