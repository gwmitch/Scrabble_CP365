#note This is game 4 of my 2012 bay area matchplay series against Noah, I'm up 3-0. (commentary by Jesse)
>Noah: AEEIOOP -AEIOO +0 0
#note he needed the P for epopoeia!
>JD: ?CHILPR 8D CHIRP +30 30
#note there it is, one turn late
>Noah: EEFFNOP D3 OFFEN.E +30 30
>JD: ?AEILQZ 6D .QuALIZE +95 125
#note wow, that was a huuuuge break
>Noah: ELLNPTU C9 PULLET +29 59
#note I held for a bit. this is one of those words that looks like a word, but, well, who knows?
>JD: AAIINRT 9H ANTIAIR +63 188
>Noah: BOOT 8L BOOT +38 97
>JD: BDEGORU 13B B.ROUGED +66 254
#note I'm in really good shape now.
>Noah: DGHMNTU 3C D.UGHT +30 127
#note thud looks better. dought is quite defensive.
>JD: ACEGITU 12I AUGITE +17 271
#note I could play BUG if it were a close game (not that I saw it) but taking out 12H and turning over tiles seems good.
>Noah: AEIMNRY H1 MI.Y +39 166
>JD: ACIOOSV 14I OVISAC +42 313
>Noah: ADEENRT L4 TED +35 201
#note tough call, there are a ton of As Es Ns and Rs left so turning over tiles is ok - but then again, that ends the game faster and closes the board.
>JD: AEJNNOO M2 JEON +26 339
#note I played jeon to block bingoes from the M and set up points next turn.
>Noah: AELNRSW K5 W.N +24 225
>JD: AAENNOW 10H WEAN +25 364
#note wean seemed to keep the best balance, also keeping the O and messing up row 11. NONE at N1 is quite nice though.
>Noah: ?AELMRS O1 MARLiES. +80 305
>JD: AAKNOOS 14A KA. +22 386
#note arak is far and away the standout play - I didn't look long enough. the X is out, but I have all the As and Os so 10B isn't a threat. the biggest threat I can see is a bingo on row 15. By playing KAT I set myself up to score next turn if necessary (the only scoring play he can have there is ID and that would empty the bag). I'm not sure what combos he could have that beat me even after kat - he could hit delivers on row 11, but even then I win all possible endgames.
>Noah: EEIIRSY 7B YE. +7 312
#note from his perspective he has one huge draw he can hit...INSIDER at 15A. maybe his best chance is throwing down DOUGHTY/YE and then hoping I miss insider (I would play VOX and then he would win by a few points).

#note noah went over by a minute, final score is 486-354. Thanks for participating in this year's matchplay, noah!
