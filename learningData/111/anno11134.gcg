#note This eats a hotspot, scores a bunch, and holds onto XU next turn 12K or REX 3K if I draw an E.

#note Really hate how this opens a line with those blanks out, but I think I need to make this play.

#note JOE telegraphed the blank to me, but I just can't do anything worthwhile in the 11 spot to kill it. QUAR(E) J4 is nice.

#note Not really sure how to sim this. I needed to play off a lot of tiles and hope I pulled the blank. I also needed to score enough to threaten to outrun if I pull the S. Quackle suggests OL(E)ATE B9, which makes it really hard for him to block while scoring. 
>Doug_Riblet: ADDORST 8A TOADS +38 413
#note He was torn between trying to block a play that could outrun me at 8A or trying to block a bingo. He spent a ton of time on this turn and finally just decided to play this and hope I didn't have a bingo.
