>Jesse: ?AABEEL 8C EAtABLE +68 68
#note Game 5 of the series - Jesse is up 3-1. One more win and he knocks Ed out of the tournament. Interesting to consider that EAtABLE takes an S. 
>Ed: AEIILNR E4 INER.IAL +78 78
#note Well, that placement worked for Ed.
>Jesse: ACESTUX F4 TUX +55 123
#note Not looking good for Ed.

#note Sims 7 back of the cute GAIJIN.
>Jesse: EHOSSTU 5E ..THOUSES +74 227
#note BEAST! Even more impressive after he already had (B)ESHOUTS set up on his rack. Ed held.
>Ed: AEEIISW H12 AWEE +28 161
#note Sims 3 behind F10 WAE.
>Jesse: ACHLOTZ B4 AZOTH +31 258
#note Ballsy play on Jesse's part, with the second blank still unseen. Quackle does agree, to the tune of 3.5 equity points. I personally feel like if a huge setup like that wins by very few equity/win% points, then it indicates some large degree of variance, which Jesse might want to at least be wary of, when he already has the ability to go up 100. In any event, an excellent play.
>Ed: IIMNSTY A1 MITY +48 209
>Jesse: ?ACEILN A8 CAuLINE +122 380
#note Well, drawing the blank certainly helped. Still a fine display of word knowledge and board vision on Jesse's part this game.
>Ed: BILNOSU -  +0 209
#note Blocking NUBILOS(E). Ed has to challenge here if he isnt 100%. Even then he probably does.
>Jesse: GMORRST 2G GORM +21 401
#note Right play, wrong spot. G12 is 4 more, but accomplishes a bit more. Game is all but over, though.
