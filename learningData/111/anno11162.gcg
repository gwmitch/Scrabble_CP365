#note Jesse starts the session up 2-1, in the best of 7 series. dacrON commentating here. As for this strange opening rack, JiNX is a good idea here. Trade 1, anybody?
>Jesse: AGGLOVW 8G VOW +18 18

#note UNrOOTs is best here.
>Jesse: AGGILPS 8M GIP +32 50
>Ed: EILMOUY K9 .IMELY +22 85
#note YOM sims best, with consideration to YULE and YLEM. As it turns out YLEM would've kept Jesse from bingoing! This play sims a fair bit back.
>Jesse: ACGILNS F6 SCALING +74 124
>Ed: AEOORUZ 12C ERU.O +12 97

>Jesse: ABDEFNR 5A BANED +31 290
