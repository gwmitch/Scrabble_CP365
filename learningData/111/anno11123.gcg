>Paula_Catanese: EJW 8G JEW +26 26
>JD: ILLOQSX J6 QIS +46 46
#note tough call, but it seemed possible that she would just have nothing at all to do after QIS if she had the wrong letters.
>Paula_Catanese: ELOP 9F POLE +26 52
>JD: FKLLOSX H7 F..L +7 53
#note weird position in which all options are equally bad. I could blow up the rack and exchange, but ILK does make sense. for some reason I wasn't sure of ILKS.
>Paula_Catanese: ?ENRRTU 11B RETURNs +69 121
#note I had already used quite a lot of time thinking about the first two moves, so this is when it became clear that this was going to be a tough one to win.
>JD: AKLOPSX C8 POL.AX +32 85
#note I'm not in a great place so far in this game. she considered challenging this play.
>Paula_Catanese: EZ 8A ZE. +42 163
>JD: ADEKOSS B10 A.KED +43 128
#note I am usually not a big fan of intentional phonies, but...I thought this could stay on and it seemed considerably better than ARKOSE. In retrospect it was too big of a gamble to take but I lucked out this time.
>Paula_Catanese: ADDIIIY 10F AI. +23 186
>JD: AELOOSS A12 OLEO +36 164
>Paula_Catanese: ETT 12E TET +23 209
#note this was a really interesting board with lots of places to score - I was about to really kill her on lane D with my two esses until she blocked.
>JD: AENSSSV D4 AVENS +34 198
#note AVENS appears to be unnecessarily worse on D, since it sets up the R and the H.
>Paula_Catanese: HINT 3C THIN +26 235
>JD: HNOSSUY 13G SHOYU +27 225
#note I needed this play pretty badly.
>Paula_Catanese: AEMUV 12K MAUVE +26 261
>JD: FIMNORS 2F INFORMS +70 295
#note the triple has to stay open for now.
>Paula_Catanese: GU H13 .UG +21 282
>JD: BCGIIOT 1F BIOG +46 341
#note trying to pull away before she bingoes....
>Paula_Catanese: AERY 1L AERY +27 309
>JD: ?CCDINT O7 oCCID.NT +86 427
#note the esses were gone so this is a safe play.
>Paula_Catanese: B 10N B. +10 319
>JD: AADIITW K4 WAIT +27 454
#note I guess VIA is smarter than emptying the bag if I'm convinced a bingo is immiment, but I just took the points. WAIT at 14L to block a lot of bingos is interesting.
