#note I really didn't think this was good! but I chickened out of challenging even though it blocked ENORSTY. Of course, it actually IS a word.
>JD: ENORSTY J10 YON +28 54
#note stupid! stupid! ack! I had tyrosine all lined up but I totally didn't realize that I could now still lay down TYROSINES! fortunately my leave is good enough that I'm going to bingo soon anyway.

>JD: EEJORST M3 JOT +24 78
#note this is not going my way so far! no spot for resojet. this is also a big error - just JO leaves a signficantly better leave. the T really helps.

#note I'm lucky that I drew a bingo - I also wasn't sure if this was good (it is).

#note it's pretty even between exchanging and playing through - but it's interesting that ed inferred this play as showing strength, as opposed to having garbage. I would rather stay level than have to rely on drawing a bingo.

#note crazy stroke of good luck for me...
>Ed_de_Guzman: ELRRUUX 13A LURE +16 281
#note his actual rack. he didn't know the L hook to CURIA which could have helped a lot.
>JD: AEGHNOT 15F THAE +36 331
#note I was in great shape for this play beause I have both THAE and GOTH no matter where he plays. I think THAE is a better option here, holding the potential of a play at column N if necessary.

>JD: GIINNOW C2 WI. +30 361
#note important play where I think the sim is totally off-base...quackle's favorite is OW N11 which will not work against a thinking opponent. I also really dislike the top-simming play of GLOW. the way I see it there are two main spots for him to score - A1 and A12. GLOW is a lot of points, but if he hits A1 then IINN is a terrible starting point (although there are no more of either in the pool). WIZ also holds the O for column N.

#note my third best option says quackle, after FINE and GONIF, neither of which I thought of. I thought about playing ROWING first, but that leaves me with only one out. the solution is to reverse the order of the plays and do FINE first, leaving me with GONIA also.
