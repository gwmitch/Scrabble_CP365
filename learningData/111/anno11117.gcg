#note Jesse Day is MatchplayL Round 4 Game 3. I'm up 2-0 in the best of 7 series. To start, here, I wised up out of playing WISEUPS*.
>Doug: CILO D8 .ILCO +20 20
>dacrON: HIOSTUU F6 HU. +16 44
#note I was too concentrated on leaving stuff open that I neglected UH for 6 more.
>Doug: ACELV E2 CLAVE +25 45
>dacrON: IMOSTUU G7 M.OU +17 61
#note Thought I might be missing something, but I'm still about a month away from studying MUTI(C)OUS by probability. Ouch.
>Doug: GPY C12 GYP +21 66

>Doug: OTV 10B VO.T +15 81

#note Debated this and (C)HADRI. Sim goes with me.
>Doug: ?AAENNS 2G ANANkES +60 141
>dacrON: ADEEILR 14C .EDALIER +67 192
#note So I almost missed (P)EDALIER. Problem is, I flat out DID miss (S)IDEREAL! That's not good! LEADIER even underlaps 5 tiles for 81. Always tough with the blank there. Not a stellar play.
>Doug: ABDFQUY H12 QU.D +72 213
#note youch.
>dacrON: EEFIINT 1L FINE +44 236
#note Scored as 48.
>Doug: ABFY 1G FAY +44 257
>dacrON: EIIRTTT I9 TITI +16 252
#note Missed T(A)TTIER. This play sucks.
>Doug: BDLOO J6 BLOOD +27 284
>dacrON: EIKNORT 4A KRON. +37 289
#note I missed T(A)ROK, likely because I was trying to keep the board open. I'd like to think I'd have played it if I'd seen it, but instead, it's a bad miss.
>Doug: ?AAEIMT O1 .MAcIATE +77 361
>dacrON: DEGINOT N7 INGOTED +65 354
>Doug: BER A1 BER. +30 391
#note Let's look at my rack. So I've got about 12 minutes on my clock - Doug has 1. I note he has GEEZ for 46 at M4 as well as L12 GE(E)Z for 48. Those plays score too much for any out in two that I have, so I'm sunk, right? But then I concoct a Hail Mary, that just might work because he is so low on time. 
>dacrON: AENRRSW I1 ..WN +14 368
#note If he plays GE(E)Z for 48, I've got RA(Z)ERS for 52 and out to win. If he plays GEEZ for 46, I lose.
>Doug: EEGOXZ 12L GE.Z +48 439
#note Doug thinks for a few seconds...
>dacrON: AERRS O10 RA.ERS +52 420
#note BOOM!
>dacrON:  (EOX) +20 440
#note Final score recorded as 444-439. Fortunately I still won without the scoring mistake - I only make a few of those a year. I'm up 3-0 now - can Doug pull off the comeback?
