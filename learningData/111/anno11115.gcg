#note Quackle like VIBIER 4D 24 and F9 FRIB 19 more. I guessing he will challenge FERVOR
>Fadlan_Satria: DEEFGIN F9 FEIGNED +74 172
#note Fadlan overdrawn, I picked his blank, yet he still can make a bingo....Missed 10A FEIGNED/PETIOLATED for 79... FEIGNED 9F was more risky and score lower

#note Funny enough. Fadlan FOOL give me high scoring J spot. However I found how to make my J unstoppable. That was one of the craziest consecutive set-up play
>Fadlan_Satria: ADEX I12 AXED +48 348
#note Fadlan tried hard to keep his score in same level with me
>Christian_O.B: AEIJNSW B2 JAW +60 420
#note That was like K.O punch for him....
>Fadlan_Satria: IM B6 MI +24 372
>Christian_O.B: AEINSUU D10 ..U +12 432
#note Quackle hates my bluffing play...T.T. 3J UNAU is best according to quackle. I don't dare to open the board first. Instead, playing only U will at least give Fadlan warn "What happened, maybe he is very close to bingo too", OMG what should I do???
>Fadlan_Satria: CILOS 14H ..COILS +30 402
#note If Fadlan hold his S, I have no chance to block it by forced myself using triple letter, with awkward letter in 3rd position, and keep my letter good for counter him if he still capable to bingo. Would be hard task to me
>Christian_O.B: AEINOSU 15K UNAIS +27 459
>Christian_O.B: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 464
#note Since Fadlan had only 6 tiles, I have no worry about bingo...
