#note I hate when this happens.  Oh well.  At least I found the highest scoring play, though it's nothing to write home about.
>John_Scalzo: ADEHLSS A7 HEADL.SS +86 117
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEJRUX B6 JAR +33 145
#note J(E)UX for 26 keeping RACE?  Looks good, just was hard to pass up 7 points AND keep the X.  Hard to say if this is where the game turned, but there sure was something I didn't do right.

>John_Scalzo: HNO C5 NOH +32 164
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEIOS B14 AI +24 195
#note DEIOS > ADEOS apparently.  I should play AA?  Makes sense, I think, because AO really clashes at times.
>John_Scalzo: BEN D4 NEB +24 188
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENORS J9 O. +5 200
#note Yeah, considering this board, I don't think I'd bingo even if I'd played AA.  The INDORSE rack doesn't go down.  Oh wait, no, it does.  SORDINE 12I theoretically.  AJAR/ANE is interesting.

>John_Scalzo: EELNRST K5 RELENTS +86 305
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: BDORTUV 6J V.RB +17 293
#note 6I OV(E)RDUB 23?  DUV(E)T is a little less aggressive option, too.  Blocks bingos to the S, as well.
>John_Scalzo: GINTU M4 TU.ING +12 317
#note Well, that's a chance for me to make something happen.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEKOTU L1 DUKE +26 319
#note 12L AUK 20 looks okay since there're no Ses left.  DUKE is a bit too aggressive, giving too easy a way to score back.  I pay for it.
>John_Scalzo: EFIW 1H WIFE. +36 353
>Ryan_Fischer: AILOOTT 7E IOTA +16 335
#note Now all of a sudden it seems I need a bingo to catch him, miracle 40-pt plays aside.
>John_Scalzo: CENO 2G CONE +22 375
>Ryan_Fischer: IMOPQTY M11 QI. +12 347
#note Champ says just dump the Q.  Me, I try to make a little more of the mess I've made, with this little setup.
>John_Scalzo: AIILLMP N1 LIPA +15 390
>Ryan_Fischer: AMOPTY L12 P.AY +34 381
>John_Scalzo: ILM N10 MI +21 411
#note MIL, MIL(NEB), and LIM(Y) go out.
>Ryan_Fischer: MOT 4G MOT +13 394
#note His little gaffe gave me TOM for 21, but I didn't see it, obviously.  Wouldn't have won me a game.  Bummer of a loss, but after winning 7 in a row, I guess I was due.
