>Noah: BIKLNOW 8A KILNWO.. +51 124
#note I was pretty sure there was something in DIKLNOOW, but this turns out to be phony. Even if this were good, this might be a bad decision because it opens the left side of the board a lot, while BLOWN K3 closes some of the board.
>Nick_Meyer: NOSY 3I ..ONY +16 68
#note Nick set down SOY K4 at first and pondered.
>Noah: BFILNNU 10B FLUIN. +20 144
>Noah: BFILNNU --  -20 124
#note I thought I might get a challenge out of this, and it blocked the board a bit better than something like FUNNY.
>Nick_Meyer: Q B7 Q. +11 79
#note I guess I got what I wished for.
>Noah: BFILNNU 11C FUNN. +22 146
#note Is FUNNILY better than this? Maybe I overrated BIL.
>Nick_Meyer: ?DEEEST J6 DElETES +73 152
>Noah: BEHIILT K11 HI +22 168
#note Wasn't sure what do here. Missed HENBIT L1, which looks right.
>Nick_Meyer: ?AEFIOS C1 FOrESAI. +84 236
#note Perhaps FEIjOAS 1E.
>Noah: ABEIILT 1J ALBITE +43 211
#note Missed ALBEIT, which looks a bit better since the T is better to bingo from than the E.

#note Didn't see anything I could do to win. I guess AX/MINARET could do it. Should've done AX.
