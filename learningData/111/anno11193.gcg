#note Imagine, you're sitting across from the champ.  Your rack: this drek.  Somewhere, out of the aether, a 6-letter K word beckons you.  Have you the guts to pull the trigger.  Words cannot express the relief I felt when he nodded and turned the board towards him.  Best.  Of note: LIK(UTA).
>David_Gibson: EEF C2 FEE +15 112
#note He puts this down before I've even drawn tiles, and I'm feeling good 'cause he's opened with a weak play and I made a good play with an ... okayish ... leave... oh please let me draw something decent!  (Damn.)
>Ryan_Fischer: IILLNRW B4 WILL +16 133
#note Q static wants WIN.  I hate it.  WILL is the only other thing that makes sense.  They're both horrible.  WIN sims about 3 points better, but where am I going with ILLR?

>Ryan_Fischer: HINRRTV -HRV +0 133
#note #(*^%(@^()@$  I can handle my rack going dead against ANYONE else.  But not him.  ><  Best play static is F8 (A)V(E)R.  My exchange is a ways down, but at least it ranks.
>David_Gibson: INOW A1 WINO +33 222
#note The fork woulda worked if I could draw something to hit it.  Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: INRRTUX G10 .RUX +21 154
#note Rack dead again, and now I have to open up this volatile spot to get back in it.
>David_Gibson: LNUY K10 LUNY +26 248
#note And the master shuts down the board first chance he gets.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINRT A7 ARENITE +76 230
#note At least I backdoored into this.
>David_Gibson: DEIN 13C INDE. +26 274
#note He took a looong time here.  Must have had a really good rack.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIJNORV 12I JI.N +22 252
#note Though I don't have the hook, I figure I need to preemptively open before I get crushed.  This or JO(Y), take your pick.
>David_Gibson: CGOSZ M9 COGS +22 296
#note Quackle is useless here.  David told me he had COZ for 34 but opted in true champ style to close again with COGS.  I had FORGiVE set to go.  I specified that partial rack and Q STILL suggests to play COZ by 3 win pct and 8 pts.  Letting me get down a 90pt. bingo is hardly a smart idea unless your rack is great too and you have a comfy lead and no better options.

#note Careful...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEEGRV 14D GED +23 308
#note 14B VEG is a little better, though the outcome will still be the same.  I've painted myself into a bit of a corner here as so many of his victims do. His rack is no doubt wonderful and I've GOT to open in order to score and keep up with him.  Punishment is imminent.  Help?  EDGER is very nice, though, too.
>David_Gibson: ?EINOZ 15F sOZINE +45 355
#note Damn.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EORSSV 8D .....S +9 317
#note This is second.  I drew into OVERSHy (phony).  Would've tried it had he not blocked.  Champ says fish off the V at (A)V(E) for 6.  Two lanes.  Wonder if I could hit anything.
