#note I see the fun phoney NITROXYL here, but elect not to play it because, well, it's phoney. (Note: upon further investigation, NITROXYL#)

>Matt_Canik: AIMNPST J6 PT.MAINS +70 102
#note This was just me being dumb. I couldn't remember if it was PITMANS or PITMENS* (EMPTINS). If I had thought of EMPTINS, I would have played PITMANS. Bleh. I need to study.

#note Type a note here! Quackle prefers JA(N)E for 31. I'm not sure why, BEGR seems kinda gross to me. 
>Doug_Riblet: AMN B13 MAN +20 140
>Matt_Canik: ?EEEJLT K3 JETE +26 157
#note I thought this was a pivotal mistake, choosing JETE over JEE. Quackle's actually simming this better, though. 
>Doug_Riblet: AEORRTV H1 OVERRAT. +86 226
>Matt_Canik: ?AEEELO A13 ALE +24 181
#note I'm not comfortable leaving this spot open any longer, even if there are only two unseen As. This could blow up for 50 at any time, and most good plays this turn make me burn the A. 

I probably should have risked it one more turn and played (J)OE.

#note At this point, I've really just gotta hope I pull really good stuff while I desperately try to score enough to get back in this.

>Matt_Canik: AEEIUUV -EIUUV +0 334
#note NOTHING has gone right for me since JETE. He even blocked UVULA, which would have been a nice bailout for this rack. I exchange holding AE because the pool is really conso heavy.
