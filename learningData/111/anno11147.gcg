#note very close between this and exchanging, but I should probably just exchange.

>jd: ADIRRSU 10F DUR. +9 23
#note for whatever reason I got fixated on this play even though it's not necessarily an obvious choice. it really limits his ability to score while also leaving pretty reasonable bingo letters.

>Peter_Armstrong: ADHLOTV --  -107 93
#note this is a huge gamble on his part. if this is good and he hits it, and especially if I challenge incorrectly, he has the game sealed. if he misses I have more info on his rack and dibs on row 13. that said if he thinks it has a shot it's a nice chance to take, especially because trying it doesn't immediately kill his winning chances. He knew that HAVDALAH was good; I vaguely knew something like this was good, but 107 was too many points to allow for something I wasn't 100% on.
>jd: EINRSTT K8 STINTER +72 141
#note since I know his replies are limited, now might be a good time to throw open the board with TINTERS/RETINTS.

>jd: AGHORSU 13B HORA +38 179
#note with my knowledge of his rack I need to take this spot

#note whoa!
>jd: EEGOSTU 11B TOGUE +15 194
#note I chickened out of playing TOGUE on the right because I thought it was too easy for him to score, and I also worried that it wouldn't leave me good bingo lanes. that said it's not that easy to take that spot.
>Peter_Armstrong: EZ N13 ZE. +28 231
>jd: CEEIINS 9I .I.E +8 202
#note this seemed like the most obnoxious opening to create. I wasn't sure that CITER was good which makes it easier for him to block.
>Peter_Armstrong: BDGLRVY -BDGLR +0 231
>jd: ACEINQS B9 QA. +14 216
#note I played QAT instead of QI because I wanted to make sure I had a lane on column D if he blocked column M.

>jd: AEIRTVY 4B VE.TIARY +65 385
#note things got extremely weird right here...my rack was AEIOTVY, and we suddenly realized the O from GESTAPO was missing. We returned the O from my rack to the board, and I was allowed to draw a new tile from the bag, and it gave me a bingo...
>Peter_Armstrong: EENRSTU M3 TENURES +76 329
#note even though pete bingoed, since I did too he has no chance to catch up. And then as soon as he made his play, I realized we were a tile short - and there was an O stuck in his stack of scoresheets. I felt terrible.
>jd: BFILLOP 3G FOB +36 421
#note spread didn't really matter, so I passed on FLIP in case it gave him some miracle win.
>Peter_Armstrong: EGRW L1 GREW +32 361
>jd: BILLLOP 1L .LOB +21 442
#note glib is waaaaay better. I was low on time and frazzled from the curious case of the missing O.

#note peter played his best endgame...nice work.
>Peter_Armstrong:  (L) +2 408
#note so in the end I won the tournament and got back over 2000...yay! Howver, I wish it had been in better circumstances than bingoing because the O was removed from my rack. Sorry Peter.
