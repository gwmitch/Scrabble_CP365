#note Very interesting play. I also considered SERRY and WY(E), but didn't see SYREN. I like SERRY better than SYREN because it opens fewer bingo opportunities (keeps my initials too!). I don't like WY(E) -- ENRRS seems shitty here. The S is a good tile to keep, and the Y has good scoring potential here, so I like WONNER since it scores decent and keeps pretty good tiles here.

#note This doesn't let him fish any longer, keeps a good scoring tile, and takes a strong lead. Now I just need him to not bingo.
