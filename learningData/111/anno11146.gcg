#note mike has a strangely bad record against me. it's about time he beat me a bunch of times in a row like xp has started doing.

#note I was playing pretty fast. I guess most of my plays where pretty straightforward. totally forgot PERNOD is good!
>Mike_Frentz: ABRY B12 BRAY +32 234
>jd: AADEENP A8 APNEA +33 329
#note I could just play PA, but APNEA starts to end the game faster. close call.

>jd: EEKLOPY 3A KEY +35 395
#note with lots of power tiles remaining I'm a little bit worried here. at first I was trying mostly to choose between PREY and POLE at A1, before settling on KEY. the star play is really LOPE at 3A, blocking the triple on row A and setting up KEY for 49 in a spot that he will have a very hard time using. I was looking for this sort of play but didn't come up with it.

>jd: EILOPST 1A LOTI +31 426
#note I have the case T so I don't have to play that fast, but keeping the P is nice.
>Mike_Frentz: EFILNQU 7J ..F. +10 361
#note mike did his patented "play off one tile and leave the new tile facedown" trick, from which I figured he had to have a Q bingo - and then I realized he was fishing for AQUILINE. Fortunately, I had the I, and I now also knew that the last tile in the bag was either the N or the X. from there I ran out  of bright ideas.
>jd: ACEIPRS 1L C.AP +33 459
#note spread wouldn't matter for the tournament as long as I beat mike by more than 60 or so, so I didn't try ILIUMS. However, I completely airballed on AIRSPACE/AIRSCAPE (tho AIRSCAPE is not worth it for sure). championship player says things I don't really believe about my play being better than AIRSPACE, but I would definitely play the latter if I saw it.

#note I was now in a position where I just had to beat Peter to win the tournament.
