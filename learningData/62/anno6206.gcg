>Al_Anneal: ?ABMSTT H4 MATTS +20 20
#note As played on CBC Radio One's "All in a Day", May 10, 2010.
#note BATTS is slightly better than MATTS because B is harder to use.
#note Using the S to get eight more points is just barely worth it.

>Al_Anneal: ?HIINRR O12 HIN +23 310
#note This appears to be a giveaway, but it was meant to be a release valve in case HE scores a bingo elsewhere.
>Hidden_Expert: DEEOSTU 15L DUST +55 297
#note By playing his S here, HE has left other lines open for us.

#note DECRIeR is also good.

#note This odd-looking play is meant to block HE's possible out-play of NEE, while setting up our own, which HE can't block.
