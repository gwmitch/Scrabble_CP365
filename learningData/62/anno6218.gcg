#note Yuck.  I saw ZIT and didn't like the FLAWN leave.  I felt that the Z play could wait while I unloaded the clunk.  Quackle prefers taking the points with F6 ZIT.

#note Best, nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Jeanne_Wilson: DLOU 13B LOUD +22 76
>Jim_Burlant: EGILNNO 10E .OLING +15 65
#note What do you do here if you don't know LONGLINE?  All I saw was ELOINING (which didn't play) and couldn't decide on anything else so I thought I should just turn the rack and try again.

#note Yeah, I know the hook's phony.  So sue me. Joking aside, even though there had been a lunch break between my last game and this one, the Wornum and Dreyer debacles were still fresh in my mind.  Only seeing an unplayable 8 in my previous rack and having what would have otherwise been a no-go here, I picked up a vibe that, even though the score was still close, this game would go south fast if I didn't come up with something big.  I decided to put this down to make something happen.  The play wasn't so much as held.   And it leaves the legitimate choices in the dust.  Best legit play is D12 BUNA 22, which wins 43%.  This play wins 65.

>Jim_Burlant: GNORRTT 4H .RONT +16 164
#note Quackle prefers D1 ROT or D1 TOR or H10 INTORT, the latter of which I didn't see.  Of those choices only INTORT really makes sense to me.  The other 2 don't; I question playing for only 12 points and leaving myself 4 consonants when there are better rack-turning options out there.   INTORT looks good; I just didn't look hard enough to find it.

#note Quackle prefers 6B DEX as a fish; I prefer to score, though i  wasn't thrilled about giving up the case N.
>Jeanne_Wilson: AEFM D1 FAME +40 177
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGIRV 1D .RIDGE +33 223
#note Couldn't think of FERVID or FIVER, which are definitely better than this.  
>Jeanne_Wilson: AEW B5 AWE +31 208
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIJV J2 AV.ID +15 238
#note Quackle likes 9J AJIVA; I don't.  But 5A VANDA - which I didn't see - would have been much much better than this.
>Jeanne_Wilson: IIOR L4 .ORII +6 214
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHJMR 8K H.JRA +45 283
#note Sim winner is H6 AHEM...I was more concerned about taking away lines for easy 7's given that the blanks were out.
>Jeanne_Wilson: ?EEOSSU N5 OvE.USES +59 273
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIMOT B11 MO.E +19 302
#note Couldn't decide what to do here.  With the blank out I didn't want to give her an easy bingo line, but I didn't want to leave myself short of consonants.  I only saw OMIT O12 and this choice; AMIE M10 definitely would have been best had I thought of it.  Immediately after I hit my clock after making this terrible play, I realized, "OMG, what if she has the H?"
>Jeanne_Wilson: IU G1 .UI +5 278
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGITY 12L EA.Y +22 324
#note Sim winner is M11 YAGI...which seems silly given that S? are still unseen.  This choice sims second, and at least now I don't have to worry about the H.  I'm at 47% now.
