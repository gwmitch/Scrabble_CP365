>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEGLN J3 ENLArGE +68 68
#note A few choices that I missed score 70 instead of 68.  EvANGEL wins the sim with J6 EuGLENA second.
>q: ELNRSTV 6E VENTR.LS +63 77
>Jim_Burlant: AACFNOR L1 FRACA. +30 98
#note K3 FOAL 25 wins; this choice is second, roughly 6 points down.  Didn't see FOAL and felt that 30 was worth the play.
>q: AEEEORU E3 OEU.RE +18 95
>Jim_Burlant: ?KNOQST 8A STOK. +42 140
#note Best, though the sim says QuOTE worth consideration at 8A and 4A.
>q: AAAENRT I6 .A.A +12 107
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINOQT B1 QuOTIEN. +86 226
#note Best bingo, simming at 93%.
>q: ADEMNRT H8 .NDREAMT +89 196
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIIWY 11E WEI.DY +26 252
#note D1 DEWY wins the sim; was blinded by the presence of the I's.  This sims roughly 3 points down.
>q: HILOPSZ D1 HOLP +36 232
>Jim_Burlant: CEIINOT 1L .OCI +27 279
#note Was going to play INFECT 1J but didn't likel the easy front extensions.  Turns out to be a good choice - FOCI wins the sim with FICO also worth consideration.
>q: ADILOSZ C8 .ZALID +52 284
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINTU 15B UINTAI.E +59 338
#note A bit of a miss here - missed MINUTIAE 14 H.  This is second best, and preferred to the 15E placement.  The duck says I'm still at 81%, with MINUTIAE winning 86.
>q: DHIORSY 1D .YOID +36 320
>Jim_Burlant: FGINSTX 13G F.X +25 363
#note Duck prefers to dump the rack with FAXING; I initially put that down but saw no reason to break up GINST.  And I'm rewarded on the next turn.
>q: AHMPRSU 14E UH +28 348
>Jim_Burlant: EGINRST O1 .GNITERS +80 443
#note Best play - I was right to not pass up any of the bingos here.   I'm at 97%.  And looking at this pool, I should be a shoe-in for the win, right?
