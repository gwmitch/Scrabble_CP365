#note damn. i wrote down NIACINS which i saw in 1s on my pad and thought it looked stupid. it's good - wish i had confidence in this stuff. my cardbox says i've seen it once before 23 days ago and got it wrong.   Also, i should've played PINA not PAIN which i realised millisecs after hitting the clock.
>paul: AINOPRT 15A ANTIPOR. +83 165
>james: ?CIINOS J2 NICOISe +73 241
#note i prefer this over b8 INCISION.  i'm bailed out for my mistake of not going with NIACINS.
>paul: EELNOSV 3E NOVEL.SE +66 231
>james: CEGIIMR 4H MI. +19 260
#note i spent 7 minutes on this.  i didnt like the though of him hitting H4 with the X. and i didnt kind keeping the IG with the N open at L12.  Paul looked very comfortable (though he was listening to the yankees game on his radio headphones so maybe was distracted). i just felt he had an X play lined up...
>paul: AEHILX 8J .XHALE +57 288
#note he had IL(E)X also he told me, so perhaps my intuition was right.
>james: CEEGINR N4 CREE.ING +65 325
#note lucky draw - this also screws the board up in my favor.
>paul: AUUW 2E AW +28 316
#note paul gets into UU trouble on the next few turns
>james: AAFGTTY 4D FAG +24 349
#note i turned down 4a FATTY as i didnt want him to come back to the TWS and FAG achieved my aim of blocking a bingo hooking EM.
>paul: BSUU M1 BUS +34 350
>james: AEEOTTY 1L A.YE +30 379
#note missed 1L O(B)EY
>paul: IOOOUU -IOOOUU +0 350
#note paul didn't have the blank at this point.
>james: BDEEOTT 14A BEET +24 403
#note i'm just gonna block and score my mid 20s at this point - he's likely to have the ? after his exchange. Q likes 9E B(I)TE with my play 2nd.
>paul: DM M7 D.M +23 373
>james: DEGLOTU K2 U.ED +26 429
#note the unseen looked pretty bad - this scored decently.   best is 011 OUTED.  i am blind to the floating T at F10 at this point, not realising an 8 could play thru it.
>paul: ?ADIU K8 .U +9 382
#note i know part of paul's rack
>james: GLOORTW C13 W.. +12 441
#note i screw up here by not realising the T at F10 gives a bingo lane. Also i have only 90secs at this point. I start to play WOR(T) at b11 and then worry about a possible Y play at d12 and then just play this in a hurry.  The best play by a mile is c9 ROOTL(ET) and then anything that blocks the T.
>paul: ?ADIIOR 14J sAYID +30 412
#note paul missed 10a IDOLATRY, ADROITLY or PODIATRY ftw.  if paul drew the I rather than the Y he would have had ORIBATID.
>james: GILOORT 15M TOR +14 455
#note with only about 30s i play TOR knowing i have the W because i suddnely worry whether TOG is Collins only. 15k ROTO is better anyway.
>paul: OR D12 RO.. +13 425
#note 15K ROTOR is one more
>paul:  (GILO) +10 435
