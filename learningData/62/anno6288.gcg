>Jooey_K: EILOPRR H7 L.RIOPE +12 12
#note I'm playing for turnover with 2 blanks out and not anything solid to play. PRIORL(Y) is definitely the best play had I seen it, and ROPE(Y) is bad to me because it leaves LIR. LIRIOPE is ok because I want blanks and it opens up the board and scores SOMETHING

#note I missed AREA at 13L, but like I said I play for turnover with both blanks out and waned to get rid of more tiles. Had I seen area I would have played it, and this isn't a good play now that I look at it but playing it a column to the left eliminates a bingo lane I would have been providing otherwise, along with more scoring opportunities parallel to the double word score

>Jooey_K: ACDEHTW 15A TWA +32 153
#note WATCHED didn't play, he blocked the C hook, but I can still keep the C playing TWA for 32, listed as best play also.
>John_Luebkemann: Y 12E Y. +10 204
>Jooey_K: CDEEHQS O8 ESCHE. +45 198
#note Once I noticed this I played it immediately, it's clearly the best move and also I realized leave QD gave me an opportunity to draw AI and play QADI for a bunch parallel the next turn possibly.

#note What do you know?!

>Jooey_K: ?EGIRST K10 GE. +19 256
#note I looked for a minute, couldn't find any bingoes surprisingly, and there weren't thankfully.
>John_Luebkemann: CDEEIN A8 EDENIC +50 294
#note Nice play
>Jooey_K: ?EIRSTX B8 REX +56 312
#note Lucky play
>John_Luebkemann: AORTT K3 TAROT +15 309
>Jooey_K: ?GIKSTT 4J K.T +14 326
#note I wanted to get rid of some of the consonants without emptying the bag (that part was simple) and give myself a shot at a bingo, even if he bingoes I still could bingo off of one of his letters, but I figured he didnt have one there but took a risk. Quackle says KAT wins 83$ of the time, better than second place KIT
>John_Luebkemann: AF M3 FA +18 327
>Jooey_K: ?GINSTU C2 bUSTING +70 396
#note Quickly looking at that rack, I played Busting figuring the B would be hard to bingo with, knowing there was a blank out, along with the S and U in their position, leaving the T pretty open. However, it didn't cross my mind that I could make the blank a J which would have been better and quackle says busting wins 83% of the time, but Justing is best at 85% :-(
>John_Luebkemann: ?DELMNU 2A UN.LaMED +80 407
#note He found his only bingo, and if the blank were a J I win :-( devastating
