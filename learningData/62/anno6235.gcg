>james: ACEIJRU 4A JUICE +46 106
#note JUIC(Y) scores 50 but i liked putting an I in the middle of the board which might help me with 8s? don't know what others think.
>nancy: MPSU A4 .UMPS +48 180
>james: AAEFNNR H1 FAEN. +27 133
#note i just plain didn't see the spot for B2 FAUNA or FAUNAE. my play is just behind those and L1 FANNY which i considered.
>nancy: BEZ C3 B.ZE +30 210
>james: ACINNPR L1 PINN. +26 159
#note a K would've given CRANKPIN. L4 C(Y)PRIAN for style

#note i spent ages on this move. Q really likes G1 OAF which i didnt even consider. I wish I'd seen it. It also likes 10I DEAF or DEVA or DOVE which i thought about but passed on.  Would like advice here if anyone has it?
>nancy: DIU 10I DUI +18 277
>james: ABDEEOQ 11B QA.D +28 279
#note anyone think that maybe K8 is a better placement? q says where i put it is best, but i didnt like taking column 2 out.
>nancy: LMT K9 M.LT +12 289
#note i got the sense that this might be an S hook set up.  I should've perhaps used that sense in my thinking for my next play (which i didnt).
>james: BEELORR 12H BOL.ER +22 301
#note sims best.  i dont think i can find a play that does much to prevent the S hook - Q quite likes (C)ORBEL for 14 - perhaps that was the play.
>nancy: ?ADIIRS N6 DIARIeS +72 361
>james: EEINORR H12 .ORE +18 319
#note this or O4 IRONE for 29. i went with trying to set up a lane for 8s. Q says mine is best.
>nancy: EEGV 14F VE.GE +19 380
#note ...though blocking it is a bit too easy
>james: DEIINOR 8N .R +6 325
#note please forgive this play!  I thought i had a shot at NOTIFIED up top if i pulled a T.  I failed to notice that it didnt fit anyway. [i was tired by now]

>james: IINO B7 ION +9 357
#note IN(QUEST) for 18 or m6 ION for 15.  it didnt matter as my spread was irrelevant.  Congrats to Nancy - she's on a roll at Bayside!
