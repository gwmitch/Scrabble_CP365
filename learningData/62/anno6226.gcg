#note Was a tossup between this or 8H ET, and I felt that Chris would probably put down a small overlapping play that would make it much more difficult to bingo, so I opted for the exchange.  This wasn't one of the original choices, but it winds up simming second to 8H ET.  And against a human I think this is the better play.

#note 8G, 8D, and 8F are best placements.

#note Best, I'm at 58%.
>Chris_Grubb: CINUV 3C VICUN. +24 83
>Jim_Burlant: GINOTTX 2F XI +52 150
#note 52 points were too much to turn down.  Quackle agrees.
>Chris_Grubb: AFNW 1G FAWN +36 119
>Jim_Burlant: DGNOSTT E7 T.NGO +12 162
#note Sim winner is 9F TOED.  This play actually sims respectably, within 3 points of TOED.  If I have to leave myself vowelless, I really don't want to keep 4 consonants.

>Jim_Burlant: ADLLRST J7 D.LL +7 169
#note Saw 6J DAL and didn't like the vowelless leave.  Didn't see TIDAL, didn't know LIDAR and felt Quackle would want me to preserve the RATS leave.

#note Now I start losing the plot.  I saw plays like TRASHY, HASTY...and felt that burning the case S for anything under high 40's would be a panic move, turnover or not.  I felt I should take a turn out to force him to defend against my S.  Yes, DRAY scores 24 but it's very easy for him to defend.  3K HAY wins the sim, but I was too focused on board opening rather than playing.  Between this move and my next move - which was a huge mistake - this game went off into the weeds.

#note Had to try.  Very nice job blocking by Chris.

>Jim_Burlant: BHNORSU 10B BOU.H +25 208
#note Didn't know SHOON, whioch is easily best.  This choice would have been one of the better plays on my previous turn.  I also wanted to open lines and unload the U and didn't look hard enough at the board to see BOON.  Very poor play.

#note I'm at 2-1/2 % here.  Best is ostensibly G11 VENT, but come on - can I really let O8 sit untouched?

#note What goes around comes around.  Just desserts for some of what I did to the lower seeds.  At this point my annotation stops.  Suffice it to say that after this rack, I fished off AR from a follow-up rack of AANRRS? and wound up with a final rack of AEJNRS?, which only yields a playable bingo in Collins.  Final score recorded as 342 - 440.
