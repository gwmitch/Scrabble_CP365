#note Whiffed on QABALA, which played at 7J and 9C.  9C placement wins the sim; this play is the best non-QABALA option.
>Ed_Saunders: EIOW 7I .OWIE +20 30
>Jim_Burlant: AAABCLQ K5 CA. +16 39
#note Another whiff; 6K ABACA wins the sim.  Didn't find it.
>Ed_Saunders: OTW 8M TWO +20 50
>Jim_Burlant: AABBLMQ J6 B..L +24 63
#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: AABMNQU K9 BAM +19 82
#note Whiffed on BANQUET.  This is the next best choice, and I'm rewarded handsomely for it on my next turn.

>Jim_Burlant: AAENQTU 13I QUA.NT +50 132
#note Just lighting it up here.  Had no idea there was a bingo in this rack, AQUATONE, but once again, I benefitted from this mistake.  Turns out Ed was sitting on AMITIES, and this play wound up blocking his bingo.  This is the best non-bingo option, but it coughs up 25 points of equity to O3 AQUATONE, which is clearly best.
>Ed_Saunders: AEIIMST 14J MI +22 95
#note Ed's best play is 14J MISEAT 54, in case you're curious.  Nice find, Quackle!
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEGLL 5H GLA.E +15 147
#note I saw 15K LEGAL and passed on it - worst-casing it, if Ed hit so much as an airball down the O column I could be in real trouble on this board.  I was sitting on the blank, so I figured why not open up and play aggressively?  This decision moved the game in my favor.  Sim winner is LEGAL, with this choice second, 9 points down.
>Ed_Saunders: AEGIKST -AE +0 95
>Jim_Burlant: ?EELOUY H1 EULO.Y +33 180
#note Best.  I'm over 92% now.
>Ed_Saunders: ADEIJST 1B JADEIT.S +68 163
#note Quackle prefers this placement by a hair over the 1E.   This brings Ed back to 27%, but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENNOV F1 .NNOVAtE +64 244
#note Whiffed on DEVONiAN, which would have scored 74.
>Ed_Saunders: DEGIR 15K DIRGE +28 191
>Jim_Burlant: EIKORRT 2A KOR +34 278
#note Considered JOKIER, KORE 2A, and this.  Thought JOKIER needlessly broke up too much of this promising rack and was recklessly volatile.  I saw no reason to play off the E, which eliminated KORE.  I was plenty happy with KOR for 34 leaving myself EIRT.  The sim agrees.

#note Only playable bingo.
>Ed_Saunders: ILN 4C LIN. +8 221
>Jim_Burlant: DGHRRUU 4L DRUG +22 375
#note Didn't think of GURSH 14B, which is best.  This sims second best, roughly 5 points down.
>Ed_Saunders: FOR O1 FRO. +24 245
>Jim_Burlant: EHINRSU 14N UH +23 398
#note Didn't know INRUSHES, but with the blank still unseen Quackle prefers this play as the number 1 choice on a win percentage basis, presumably due to the unseen blank.  Truthfully, I would not have passed up the bingo had I known it.
>Ed_Saunders: AT I13 .AT +17 262
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINPRS 12A PIoN.ERS +76 474
#note Quackle says I should pass up the bingo and play DENI L4.   This I don't get.  I understand that with the blank unseen, INRUSHES would not have been my best play.  But now, I've got the blank and the available pool doesn't make any 8's with a P.  Why should I pass up PIONEERS etc?
