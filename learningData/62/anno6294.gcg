#note FON and OWN are options. They all sim within about one equity point. Comes down to style, I suppose. I'm comfortable with double N's, and the 6 extra points felt worth it.
>Whitmarsh: ADIQ 7E QAID +24 24

#note Missed NOWNOWS.
>Whitmarsh: DGOO 8L GOOD +33 57
>Tunnicliffe: ADEFINZ F6 Z. +31 123
#note Quackle likes AGONIZED, which I just didn't see. I might have still made ZA, though. I know the board is closed to bingos, but Brad pretty much has to open it up.

#note I think I was blind to the FOLIAR hook at this point.

>Tunnicliffe: EGRRRTT 5A GR.ET +18 293
#note Chickened out on GRITTER, which would have cleaned up this mess fast. GREET wins the sim, but I disagree. GRITTER blocks lines.

>Tunnicliffe: ABRRSTY 10F TRY +19 312
#note Pretty terrible. Didn't see BARYTA, and I was too obsessed with blocking the I.

#note Tsk. Dunno PARBAKES.

>Tunnicliffe: EEIPRSY 13C PREY +27 375
#note This play is pretty dumb. PEERY is what I wanted to do, but I somehow told myself it was just PEERIE. This gives Brad a spot to bingo.
