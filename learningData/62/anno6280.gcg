>bob: EISTW 8D WITES +24 24
>james: DEFHITU 7G HUT +22 22
#note i thought SHUFTIED might be good in Collins, but apparently SHUFTY# is only good as a noun.  Q prefers FUD here.
>bob: AELQSTU E4 TEQU.LAS +118 142
#note this made me worry a bit
>james: ADEEFIM 9G MEAD +25 47
#note i spent 3 mins but couldnt come up with a bingo - 11E (S)EMIDEAF - it's the only 8 in this rack. There are many better plays to mine - D10 FIE is most liked by Q. D1 FAMED for 37 is also up there in the sim.
>bob: KNOZ D10 ZONK +47 189
#note 140 points behind now - i see 1st place walking out the door.
>james: ?EEFINX 6H FIX +38 85
#note had a brief internal conversation about the merits of (ZA)X or XENIc - Q agrees with me
>bob: ADLTU K2 ADULT +26 215
>james: ?EELNNR 2G aNNE.LER +68 153
#note only bingo
>bob: ABY 1M BAY +30 245
>james: AEIIMRR 13B MI.RA +22 175
#note 1e RIMIER scores 37 - didnt see it. i considered 1e RAMI or RAMIE - but i liked the volatility that MIKRA gave me. Q puts my play a tad behind these other ones.
>bob: IJOS 4A JOIS. +40 285
>james: ADEEIOR A4 .ERID +39 214
#note missed A1 RIO(J)A - that's a bit rubbish of me.  8J AERIED or 1c REDIAE win the sim however.  My play is weak - i knew it at the time.
>bob: ACLP B10 CLA.P +34 319
>james: ?AEEIOP F10 PE +33 247
#note i saw OEDIPEAN as one 8 this rack makes and knew there was another that was super odd- EPOPOEIA - couldnt find it.   neither plays anywhere anyway.  my play is surprisingly top - despite the leave
>bob: EFINT M1 ..NEFIT +26 345
#note 1g NEIF scores quite a lot and doesnt open a bingo lane.
>james: ?AEGIOO 10I GOO +14 261
#note sims 2nd behind 3b GOO but i like my play better.
>bob: AEW H1 A.EW +33 378
>james: ?ACEGIO L9 ApOGEIC +78 339
#note scores most
>bob: NOR 15L .ORN +18 396
>james: ABEGIVV C3 V.VE +20 359
#note sims highest at 5.5% win. - still gonna take a miracle draw to win...
>bob: HNORSTU 14F HUNT +28 424
#note bob was considering m12 OH - that would have been best. he mistakenly empties the bag here however.

>james: ABDEGIR N7 ABRIDGE +65 424
#note i get my miracle draw.  i see ABRIDGER, but only being 95% i don't take any chances and lock up 1st place with ABRIDGE.
>james:  (IOORSY) +18 442
