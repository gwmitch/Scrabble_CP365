>Jim_Burlant: ADIORRW 8G ROW +12 12
#note There was a long break between the end of my round 3 game with Jerry and the start of this one.  I think it's safe to say my brain hadn't quite reengaged yet, as I honestly didn't see anything but this or WORD.   Obviously, ARROW is much better.  Nothing like throwing away 9 or 10 equity and 12 scoreboard points on what should have been a trivial opening rack.

#note Brain still isn't firing on all cylinders.  I looked at this and just puzzled over it before I gave up.  Didn't see any of the good plays  (ACIDIC, IRID, etc.),  This is me throwing my hands up, figuring I should turn 4 tiles, and try again.  Weak. H8 OI wins the sim; I don't know enough words to bank on fishing to ACDILR.  Anyway, I do wake up on the next turn.
>Mike_Baker: AELP 5B LEAP +26 44
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEERT 9G ERECTED +75 96
#note Nothing to wake you up like drawing into an easy bingo.  And it doesn't get lucker than drawing EEET to CDR and having 2 places to play it.  Of course, I didn't bother to look for the 9, REELECTED C3, which wins the sim.  This play gives up 10 pts to REELECTED.
>Mike_Baker: AIQ M7 QA.I +24 68
>Jim_Burlant: GHORSWY 8L W.RY +51 147
#note Didn't know the 20000 probabiility GROWTHY was a word and it didn't occur to me to try it.  I saw this and was happy enough with the 51 points.  This choice sims second best, albeit at a huge equity loss.
>Mike_Baker: EFN N10 DIRGE +29 97
>Jim_Burlant: EGHOSTU 15J HUGEST +44 191
#note Too bad for me he couldn't have played DINGE.  This choice sims best, and despite my turn 1 and 2 blunders, I'm at 85% right now.
>Mike_Baker: OX 14J OX +27 124
>Jim_Burlant: ADEJNOT 13I JO +23 214
#note I saw JET 10F 32 and felt that it didn't score enough to justify breaking up the rack.  Quackle agrees.  Unfortunately, I didn't see JEAN in the same location for 39, which does.  I take a sizeable hit in the sim for this choice, even though it sims third to JEAN and sims neck and neck for second with JOG 13L.  I'm still at 88%. 
>Mike_Baker: ?ADINRS O1 mISANDR. +86 210
#note Beautiful find and best bingo for Mike.  Despite the nearly tied score, Mike is still only at 34%.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEENT D4 B..TED +20 234
#note Quackle likes a bunch of N2 plays - BETA, BATE, ABET; I don't.  Yes, they outscore this.  But Mike has just drawn 7, the blank is still not in my rack.  If I play at N2 per Quackle's suggestion, all that has to happen is for Mike to hit something on row 10 within a couple of turns and this game is pretty much over if I can't come back within 1 or 2 turns. I felt it prudent to make sure the board stayed open.  I didn't like leaving him the gimme at 8A but felt that keeping the board alive took precedence and was worth the sacrifice.
>Mike_Baker: MOV 8A MOV. +27 237
>Jim_Burlant: AAEENNU -AENU +0 234
#note The only of Quackle's suggestions that makes some sense to me is AENEUS 3J...and I couldn't think of it.  I saw ENURE on row 12 and not much more...and didn't like the fact that nothing scored over 14 points, left me duplicated letters...or killed the lines Mike's bingo opened.  I felt an exchange was better, and I was rewarded quite nicely on the next turn.
>Mike_Baker: BFO 12L FO.B +24 261
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEHILN 3H INHALEr. +72 306
#note The bingos all sim within a point of each other; the sim winner is 11F HyALINE 73.  Other options included 4H ANtHELIA (which I know but couldn't find) and HyALINE(S) 3H.  I'm back at 72% now.
>Mike_Baker: EFN H1 NE.F +33 294
>Jim_Burlant: EEINNUZ 11I ZINE +31 337
#note Quackle prefers 10F ZEE 38 and C8 VENINE, the latter of which I didn't know.  I don't care that ZEE scores 38 points; I am absolutely NOT going to play both of my E's with only one E left in the unseen pool. I had also considered 2F ZEE 32, and if I hadn't drawn duplicated N's, I would have played there.  I thought that the row 11 line was probably going to be the easiest line for him to hit.  While this is the better play, making the wrong play would have probably won; making this play gave him the game.
>Mike_Baker: IORSTUV 2A VIRTUOS. +76 370
#note Mike is back in the lead at 65% winning chances now.
>Jim_Burlant: EGINOTU L1 GU. +6 343
#note To me, the equity plays were pointless and I couldn't see how I would have won if I had played them.  I felt this was a fishing situation.  I wanted to get rid of OU but couldn't find an OU fish...so this was it.  If I had the S, I would have fished off at 8A to make MUG and create the easy hook.  But I didn't have the S, so I wanted to fish off the stuff I wanted to unload and make sure I didn't create a board he could shut down.   I missed 3 scoreboard points by not fishing at A2 instead of this play, but it didn't change the outcome beyond 3 spread points.
>Mike_Baker: AAKP 7H KAPA +25 395
>Jim_Burlant: EIMNOST C8 .OMITS +28 371
#note Oh well - I thought I had a chance at one of those 3 A's -  MASONITE would have been a great finish, but it was not to be.  Congrats to Mike.
