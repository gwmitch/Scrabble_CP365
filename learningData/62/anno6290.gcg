#note Somehow I tracked that all of the S's were gone, and I thought I had the last S. Both blanks were gone but there was an S in the bag with 4 tiles left, and I was setting myself up to hook the S and even possibly bingo for a lot, forcing him to try and block it.

#note I got excited and played AN(E)ROIDS without looking for the others, which I didn't see immediately for some reason. I was dumb luck that he didnt have the S, but that was a mistake. If he had the S, I still may have won if he scored little enough for me to bingo out and get his tiles.
