#note Don't you love it when the duck starts like that?
>Dave: BCEIKOR 7I KOB +25 25
#note I spent a while on this move.  There are several that score a few more points, but this is the best for managing the rack while still scoring.  Quackle agrees.
>Kwak: ADDEIIL G5 DEI.IDAL +64 134
#note That's the reward for my hard work?  The duck bingos again and I have nothing.
>Dave: CEEFIRU 9I FEU +24 49
#note I couldn't believe my terrible luck that with three red squares open I couldn't make a play to reach any of them.  I saw the F spot at F6, of course, but I didn't want to make a play like EF F5 that would probably send me fishing on the next turn.  However, I failed to spot CUIF, which is a much better way to hit that spot.  Nonetheless, this play is not that much worse.  Given that I'm already down by two bingos, it might even be a better choice, in order to maximize bingo chances.
>Kwak: AELNNTY 11E AN.LYTE +40 174
#note Oh great, the frakkin' duck didn't bingo this time.  It just let up with a frakkin' 40 point double-double.  And again I've failed to draw a bingo despite a promising leave.  I hate this game!!!
>Dave: CEEIRUV H1 CURVE +45 94
#note At least I have this nice scoring play, keeping me within 100.
>Kwak: ADGLNUZ 6A UNGLAZ.D +103 277
#note *$#&@^$*@^$*(%$^&@^!!!!!!
>Dave: EEIIRTT H11 .ITE +8 102
#note You're down by almost 200.  There's a triple-triple line open.  You don't have a way to score.  You're probably going to lose this game by a ton.  What the hell do you do?  This is the right play against *anybody*, human, computer, or duck.
>Kwak: AAEHOPT 12C APHE..A +36 313
#note HOLY MOTHERFRAKKIN' BEJEEZUS!  TWO MORE I'S???  POKE MY EYES OUT PLEASE!!!!  IT WOULD BE MORE FUN THAN PLAYING THIS GAME!!!!
>Dave: EIIINRT -II +0 102
>Kwak: EIOORTW 15D TWIER +42 355
>Dave: EEINRTV 3A INVERTE. +74 176
#note Woo hoo, a 74 point bingo.  Aren't you impressed?  Playing this at 3D might be better against the duck, because it might actually be retarded enough to leave the triple-triple open again.  Then again, the way things are going, it would probably hit the nine-timer.
>Kwak: ?EGNOOT L1 GENTOOs +77 432
#note Just to let you know, if I had played INVERTER in the other spot, it still would have bingoed through the C.  Frakkin' duck.
>Dave: FIIIJTW A5 F.JI +42 218
>Kwak: IOOPRSX 14E OX +55 487
#note It's what you expect right?  Even on the "small" plays, it gets 55 and takes away my spot for IWIS.

#note QUEyS was 30 more, but I have to give myself the chance of at least bringing this within the range of respectability.
