#note Lesson 1: Draw a bingo rack, and find the bingo. Then start thinking you're going to win this game.
>Hubert_Wee: ENNO H8 .ENON +6 6
>Toh_Weibin: ABINPRR E5 BRA.I +20 92
#note Lesson 2: Make bad moves while thinking "hey, I'm not opening an S hook to the triple!". The right moves here are either the offensive ABR(I)N F5 or simply BARP G11, which I didn't want to risk with his extremely weird TENON play.
>Hubert_Wee: EMNX D8 .XMEN +37 43
>Toh_Weibin: EINPRRU C11 PUR +16 108
#note Lesson 3: Now that you're winning, you can focus on the "play bad" part. Look at the tiles and keep thinking that there can't be a bingo in this rack, and if there is one it's probably to the S. Then deceive yourself that PUR is a great move since it opens a bingo next move. Best move is PRURIEN(T) C1.
>Hubert_Wee: LLM B7 M.LL +8 51
>Toh_Weibin: EEIINRV 14B VEINIER +80 188
#note Lesson 4:  Only play the bingo when it's strikingly obvious. OK, I admit I found VINERIE(S) first. How terrible.
>Hubert_Wee: DENT 15G DENT +24 75
>Toh_Weibin: EFILOTU I9 FOU +23 211
#note Lesson 5: Now that you're safely in front by more than a bingo, you can afford to miss bingos that open a triple-triple, even if it's an O on the second last space. For the record, I wrote OUTFLY, OUTFLEW and OUTFLIES on my scoresheet, then chickened out of all of them.
>Hubert_Wee: KLO G8 .KOL +34 109
>Toh_Weibin: AEIILTW F2 WALI +19 230
#note Lesson 6: Think you're balancing your rack well by keeping a niceish leave, but missing the better WILI. Also, TWILI(T) C3 is available and is a very nice play.
>Hubert_Wee: CDY 11F C...DY +24 133
>Toh_Weibin: AAEEIOT G1 TOEA +15 245
#note Lesson 7: Think you're a genius when you play the blocker AE to keep your opponent from getting huge scores from the triple. IOTA 12J saves all the worry.
>Hubert_Wee: GNOOR 1G .ROGON +24 157
>Toh_Weibin: ADDEIIP 14J AIDED +22 267
#note Lesson 8: Think "Gee, he played 5 tiles, now he might draw a blank - I'd better play off 5 tiles too". Coincidentally, this play is the best...
>Hubert_Wee: ?AEHIRS A1 ARSHInE +93 250
#note ... except he's catching up.
>Toh_Weibin: EFGIPRS 15M FIG +29 296
#note Lesson 9: Get really disappointed when you didn't pick up a blank after all, and play this move quickly, even though it opens huge counter-scoring opportunities. Maybe FIG or GIF on top is better.
>Hubert_Wee: ACJTTUZ L12 JU. +22 272
>Toh_Weibin: EEPRSTW J3 PEWTERS +75 371
#note Lesson 10: Draw the rack and spot the bingo immediately - then spend all your opponent's time praying that he won't block the spot.
>Hubert_Wee: EHY B1 YEH +32 304
>Toh_Weibin: AAGIQST C1 STAG +31 402
#note Lesson 11: Think you're making a smart pre-endgame move by blocking his scoring spot. And then...
>Hubert_Wee: ?BCEOUZ 8J .EBOZo +57 361
>Toh_Weibin: AIOQ N12 QA.. +14 416
#note And the final lesson, Lesson 12: Give him 5 points for the high-scoring word, since "it won't matter anyway". I did challenge the word, but the program crashes when I click +5...
