#note Right letters, wrong word.  Couldn't think of KETO, which is best.  This is too volatile.

#note Lester's Law of post-bingo racks exemplified.  I absolutely hated this play (which sims second to PLIE L9) due to both the awful leave and dangerous board position.  But I was blinded by the V to the point where I didn't see/consider other plays.  What do you do here if you don't see PLIE?
>Ronak_Singhal: EFM N6 FEM +25 89
>Jim_Burlant: IILNOOP M2 POLIO +19 126
#note Clearly best.  That O12 hook has me nervous but there isn't much I can do about it with this rack.
>Ronak_Singhal: AJOS O12 SOJA +48 137
>Jim_Burlant: CINNPRS N1 NIP +22 148
#note Got what I deserved for my turn 3 play.  This is best, though the 4-consonant leave definitely leaves something to be desired.
>Ronak_Singhal: ??EFITU 11A dEFrUIT +68 205
>Jim_Burlant: CEINRRS B7 SINC.RER +82 230
#note If an opponent's bingo can be considered a good break, this is it. He had many better choices than this, and this one left me in much better position; the question was whether to let him have it.  If I challenged, with 2 blanks in his rack it wasn't if, but when, he would bingo.   If I challenged and made a scoring play somewhere (probably M9), I wasn't guaranteed to draw into a playable bingo.  So, despite the danger of creating the 8A hotspot,  I opted for the guaranteed 82, crossed my fingers, and hoped that he didn't draw into a Q or X bomb at 8A.  So did I make the right choice?  I reran the sim (1500 iterations, 2-ply), challenging off his phony and simming against his rack of EFITU??.   Had I challenged, the sim winner, CARVER M9, wins 47.76%.  Letting the phony stick and putting down SINCERER wins 48.01%.  Technically, this means I made the better play; in reality, the difference is so minimal as to be statistically meaningless.   It's stylistic preference more than a case of right/wrong because both plays yield virtually the same end result.

>Jim_Burlant: BDEEENU A6 DUB +32 262
#note The first good break with tiles I've had in the Main Event.  While my rack is nothing to write home about, it was a huge break that Ronak didn't draw into an 8A play after his bingo; he spent a long time on this turn before reluctantly playing at O1.  I hated leaving myself 3 E's, but I could breathe a little more easily once 8A was shut down.  This play wins the sim.
>Ronak_Singhal: RTU 7F RUT +9 243
>Jim_Burlant: EEEINOW A13 WEE +25 287
#note Quackle prefers WOE;  I don't care if there are only 2 E's in the unseen pool, I'm not keeping duplicated E's if I don't absolutely have to.  I'm now at 71%.  
>Ronak_Singhal: AELR M9 L.R.AE +20 263
#note I realize he's addled with one point tiles but I wonder if it's better for him to hold the E here given the pool.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINOY L14 YO +11 298
#note Didn't know ORANGY as a 6 (thought it was a 7 requiring an E), and didn't consider scoring with D10 GRAINY.  I figured he wasn't too likely to hit anything dangerous to the O if I put it there...and this choice played a huge part in the outcome of this game.

#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEEOX C3 COAXED +44 393
#note I put down ZINGANO rather than GINZO because I suspected he would challenge.  Quackle prefers D11 REDOX and J12 COXA, which don't empty the bag.  Given this pool and the Q friendliness of this board, do I really need to worry about emptying the bag?
