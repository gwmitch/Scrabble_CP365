#note Best - I7 FIEF also worth consideration.  Nothing to unload the W that doesn't give up too many points.
>Larry_Rand: ANUY C10 YA.UN +20 36
>Jim_Burlant: DEHNOTW E9 HOW. +26 56
#note Sim gives slight preference to 14B ENDOW 14, which I didn't let myself look for; once I saw HOWF I was satisfied.  This choice sims second, barely 1 point down.
>Larry_Rand: KSTU 15A TUSK +50 86
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIMNT 9H .EMINTED +63 119
#note The only bingo, and best play.  
>Larry_Rand: IOOZ O5 ZOOI. +45 131
>Jim_Burlant: BELQSXY F8 LEX +56 175
#note 2-ply sim winner at 1500 iterations is 10G BOXY 48 with this choice second, 1 point down.  I saw this and didn't look anywhere else. Even if I had seen BOXY, this would have been a tough call.  BOXY scores 8 less, turns the extra tile, cleans the rack up better, and doesn't give the front hook to LEX.  But do you turn down 56 points?
>Larry_Rand: ?AEGRUV B4 sEVRUGA +77 208
#note 13H placement scores 78 and my comeback is probably for 26 down the L column instead of the huge play I got on my next turn.
>Jim_Burlant: BCPQSSY 8A B.SY +39 214
#note I saw BUSY and figured that I'd deal with the Q later.  Quackle docks me 7 points, preferring 8A SUQ (the sim winner), then 8A SUQS, and N6 BY to this choice.  Neither SUQ nor BY turn enough of this hideous rack.  And I will not burn both of my S's to play SUQS when there is still that juicy S hook at H13.  With BUSY, I still score 39, turn 3, unload a duplicated S and 2 clunkers, and hang a Y rather than an S.  SUQ and SUQS sim neck and neck (slight edge to SUQ), ostensibly winning 37%, this play wins 33 according to the duck.  Pffft.
>Larry_Rand: DOPU A1 UPDO +26 234
>Jim_Burlant: BCGLPQS -BGLPQ +0 214
#note Quackle's first 3 choices:  exchange 5 keeping PS, exchange 6 keeping S, followed by this choice.  All sim within 0.2 points of each other - a matter of style preference. I did consider BLIPS K7...but thought it was a recipe for losing.  Quackle agrees with me here - the three exchanges all sim around 33%; BLIPS sims around 22.
>Larry_Rand: IO 8L OI +8 242
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEJRS 6N J. +25 239
#note Great draw! Best - I'm at 59%.
>Larry_Rand: IQ 7E QI +22 264
>Jim_Burlant: ACDERST I3 RECAST.D +68 307
#note  I couldn't find REDACTS, only saw SCARTED...and chickened out on the latter, which would have played for 83 at 13H.  I put this down because I was going with what I thought was the sure bet. Both of us thought this play was good.  Joke's on Larry and me!
>Larry_Rand: EGOR H1 GOER +23 287
>Jim_Burlant: CEELLPV J2 CEP +21 328
#note J2 LEV probably would have been right; couldn't think of it. I was most concerned about blocking 1H bingos because I didn't have a block for anything on row 13.  Sim winners are 3C LEVELER and C1 LEVEL.  I'm at 62% with this choice.
>Larry_Rand: ENST 5H S.ENT +28 315
#note Tough position for Larry - he's trailing, he wants to stay in the game.  He took a while on this turn before putting this down.  I was quite relieved to see the S come out for only 28, as I now didn't have to worry quite as much about H13 now that the S's were out.
>Jim_Burlant: EELLTVW 2A .LEW +18 346
#note Quackle likes C1 LEVEL and 7K TEW - I ruled out LEVEL because the pool was down to 1 E and there was no way I'd unload both of my E's.  A10 WELT and A10 WELL sim better though scoring 1 less.
>Larry_Rand: AINT D1 T.AIN +18 333
>Jim_Burlant: EELLRTV 3C L.VE +18 364
#note Or A10 LEV.
>Larry_Rand: AIN A8 .ANI +15 348
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGLRT M7 G..TERn +18 382
#note Thought there might be a 9 in here but would never have found LITTERbAG.  GITTERn isn't one of the original Quackle choices but it's one of only 5 that wins 100% in the 2-ply sim.
