>Jim_Burlant: AHIOTUY 8D YOUTH +30 30
#note Best; 8H placement sims roughly 2-1/2 points down.
>Monique_Kornell: BHO 7C HOB +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: AAIOPRT C2 PARIA. +22 52
#note Didn't know ATROPHIA.  Best simming non-bingo option is 6C ATAP.  Quackle doesn't like my play...and frankly, neither did I.
>Monique_Kornell: ENT D3 NET +14 35
>Jim_Burlant: CDFLOTY F5 CLO.DY +31 83
#note Best is a set of B3 plays - DOTY, COLY, TODY, and this play not quite 3 points down on those.
>Monique_Kornell: BIOR E10 BIRO +19 54
>Jim_Burlant: DEFOSTU B1 FUD +26 109
#note Best.
>Monique_Kornell: AAJ 12B AJA. +22 76
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNOST 5F .OAGENTS +72 181
#note Best bingo.
>Monique_Kornell: AEE C11 A.EE +22 98
>Jim_Burlant: DEILRSV J4 D.LIVERS +66 247
#note Wins the sim by a hair over DESILVER with the same placement.
>Monique_Kornell: ILM L2 MIL. +12 110
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDEIIT H1 DICT. +27 274
#note The old refrain:  all I saw was INCITED and DEfCIT and bingos that wouldn't play.  Only playable bingos are DEIsTIC and DEIcTIC at K9 and mISCITED 11H.  In the absence of finding a playable bingo, I can still score 27 and keep the tiles turning.  A1 IT sims second to DEIcTIC, with this play simming 10 points behind IT.  This was held, but released.
>Monique_Kornell: EELNO K9 LEONE +18 128
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEIMRT 14H MEIsTER +75 349
#note Looked for 8's from H8 and couldn't find HERMETIc.  This is a lazy play, and right after I hit the clock I realized I should have put down TRISEME, which sims 7 points better than this.  but even as lazy as it is, Quackle says that this clinches the game for me; I've gone from 99.5% winning chances to 100.   
>Monique_Kornell: ENTW 15G WENT +37 165
>Jim_Burlant: IINNQRS O12 QIS +31 380
#note Best. O12 NISI also worth consideration and QI M1 also worth consideration.
>Monique_Kornell: EPZ 13G ZEP +40 205
>Jim_Burlant: INNRRUV M11 VIN. +14 394
#note Cheap defensive play, I just figured I should take out the bingo lines and unload the V.  Quackle prefers RUNNER M9, presumably to go after the blank.  By this point I'm assuming she has the blank.
>Monique_Kornell: OX 10M OX +33 238
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNRRU 2J GA.ER +24 418
#note No delusions here...otherwise I would have found GRANDEUR on row 1. After a check of the unseen pool showed I had nothing to fear, I put this down.  GAMER is not one of the original choices, but it sims as the best non-bingo option.
