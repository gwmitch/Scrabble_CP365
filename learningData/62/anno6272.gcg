#note Quackle does not like this at all, preferring 9G OP.  I can see why - if she's got something ending in AX or EX I've given a much better comeback play; that eluded me at  the time.  In any event I don't think it would have mattered given her word knowledge and her next rack.  
>Laurie_Cohen: ?AACDIN H4 DIAC.NAl +62 74
#note Best bingos here are K8 sCANDIA and K1 ANtACID.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGINU 11E EUG.ENA +28 46
#note Since her bingo blocked my bingo (the only 8 in EUGENIA is EUGENIAS), might as well turn the rack and score 28.  This sims best, nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?FTZ F10 F.TZ +24 98
#note After the game Laurie told me that she had picked up the blank on her post-bingo rack...but as you'll see she wasn't landing any vowels to go with it, which gave me time to get back into the game.
>Jim_Burlant: AADIMOT 13C MAT.A +34 80
#note Whoops - couldn't think of DIAZO or MATZO.  DIAZO - definitely a much safer play -  is the sim winner, with MATZO second and this choice third, roughly 6 points behind DIAZO.  
>Laurie_Cohen: ?DHR 7H .H.RD +24 122
>Jim_Burlant: DEHIORT 14G THEROID +65 145
#note Bailed out by the draw for playing off my A and keeping the O.  If I'd played MATZO I'd be sitting on an orphaned AIRTHED.  This is the only playable bingo and clearly the best play - I'm back at 51%.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?NQU L12 QU.N +28 150
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILTX 15H EX +51 196
#note Sim prefers 15D AXITE and 15E LATEX, with this choice simming 4th, 2-1/2 points down on AXITE.  I can see breaking more of this rack up for, say 20 more points...but for only 6 more points?  Uh uh.  I'd rather keep this dynamite combination together.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?KRS D12 S.RK +26 176
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILRT 4H .ETAILER +70 266
#note No matter what I do, I have to slot the triple.  Pick your poison.  I felt that, since I was about to go up 90, I should constrict the board a little more and not open up the left-hand side.  Quackle disagrees, preferring 4A  ELATERID by 1-1/2 points.  I'm at 87%.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?BEGIOS O4 .uBIGOES +80 256
>Jim_Burlant: IILLNRV 15A LIN. +24 290
#note How certain do I have to be to challenge RUBIGOES* if (a) I have no idea one way or another if it's good and (b) I'm sitting on this iffy rack?  I ran the sim on this position three times; twice, this play wins; the other time M8 VILLI (which I didn't see) wins.  When LINK wins, VILLI finishes 1-1/2 points down.  I suspect that, had I seen VILLI, that would have been my choice; I only saw it at 5D, which I felt gave up too many scoreboard points to this choice.  Laurie told me after the game, that, had I not played at 15A, she would have played there with WORK for 33.  I'm down to 57% winning chances.
>Laurie_Cohen: EORWY N9 WYE +37 293
>Jim_Burlant: AILRVVY A12 VIR. +11 301
#note I spent a LONG time on this position before, essentially, throwing my hands up because I couldn't find a good play.  Not knowing ALARY K4 (the sim winner at 53%) not only limited my options here, but it wound up, in all probability, costing me the game.  I was too blinded by the duplicated V's to even look for anything that didn't unload a V.   I also got fixated on drawing into VAL(U)E 13I for 51, since 51 on this board would be as good as a bingo.  I therefore wanted to keep ALV.  In the absence of a good play, I couldn't think of anything else but to fish for an E.  N1 VIVE and L3 VIVIDLY are sim runners up; only ALARY and VIVE N1 sim above 50%.  Any placement of VIVE looks wrong with VIVE N1 looking especially insane - if she's got JIE in her rack I've played for 20 and given 66 back.  With that hook at I13, I will NOT give up both my V's.  I'm at 45% now.
>Laurie_Cohen: IOP M10 POI +27 320
>Jim_Burlant: ADLTUVY 13I VAT. +32 333
#note So much for VALUE.  This is best, with DATARY K3 simming second, 2-1/2 points down.  I'm winning 39% now. 
>Laurie_Cohen: ABMRU 3I RUMBA +37 357
#note Ouch.  What does she do with this if I find ALARY 2 turns back?
>Jim_Burlant: DGIILUY 9J YID +16 349
#note Another tough position - 2M GUY wins...but again, I thought that would have been insane given the pool and the potential for a huge row 1 play (JOCOSE, anybody?) coming back.  Not to mention that it keeps duplicated I's.   2M GUY wins the sim, 2M DUI sims with higher valuation but finishes second in win percentage, and this choice sims 3rd, 3-1/2 points down on DUI and not quite 2 points down on GUY.  I'm at 18%, with 2M DUI simming at 21.
>Laurie_Cohen: AOT 2J TAO +20 377
>Jim_Burlant: FGILNSU N9 ...S +22 371
#note I think we can disregard sim results here.  Quackle says FUSE N1 wins the sim; post-mortem, Laurie agreed that I was wise to pass on FUSE N1, as it would have given her an easy EN back for 24.  I felt it best to stay within striking distance and not give her anywhere to score.
>Laurie_Cohen: CEEEJNO 15L .ENE +15 392
>Jim_Burlant: EFGILNU 10D EF. +14 385
#note The only one of Quackle's suggestions that makes sense here is 5E GENII which guarantees me an out no matter what she puts down.  I couldn't think of this  (not remembering LUFF didn't help any) and therefore got the end game wrong.  If I put down GENII she either puts down a cheap J play and I go out with LUFF, or if she plays JOGS I play FLU to the S and win that way.  But my sequence loses.
