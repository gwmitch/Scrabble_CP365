>Laurie_Cohen: BOW 8G BOW +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOPT 9G OP +14 14
#note Best play is 9G APO; this choice sims third, roughly 3 points down.  
>Laurie_Cohen: DEEORZ 10B ZEROED +44 60
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIINT B10 .EATIN +30 44
#note I considered another fish, specifically 7I AI.  I rejected that because of the J6 hotspot it would create, and worst-casing it - if she landed an X or a Q bomb and I had another unsuccessful fish, the game could be over. I saw ZEATIN and elected to take the points.  ZEATIN wins the sim, and 7I AI is the runner up and it only sims 1-1/2 points down on this.  
>Laurie_Cohen: AEKLSSW C5 WAKEL.SS +75 135
#note Nice find by Laurie.  She's now at 79%.
>Jim_Burlant: AFINTUV 15A U.FIT +27 71
#note Quite a bad miss here- VATU A12 scores 53 and wins 20%; this wins 12%.
>Laurie_Cohen: DU 5C .UD +14 149
>Jim_Burlant: ADGHINV 8A VI.D +30 101
#note Best.
>Laurie_Cohen: AAEIRST J7 ASTERIA +68 217
#note Quackle prefers J5 ARISTAE, which wins 93% and doesn't like this.  But this placement gave me fits throughout the game and benefitted Laurie.
>Jim_Burlant: AGHILNU K1 HAULING +75 176
#note Didn't know this had an anagram.  This play only wins 15%; 4D NILGHAU wins 21.
>Laurie_Cohen: AIRY 1K .AIRY +36 253
>Jim_Burlant: CEMNORT M1 .NTERCOM +76 252
#note Back in the game; the only playable bingo.
>Laurie_Cohen: AHIO 6E OHIA +18 271
>Jim_Burlant: CEEFGNQ 4J F.E.CE +24 276
#note Cute play, but FEIGN 12H is better.  I just missed it..  Interesting - despite my lead I'm at 23%...but that's probably because those blanks are both unseen.
>Laurie_Cohen: EEVY 11G EVE.Y +29 300
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGNQU H4 QU. +22 298
#note Ok, what do you do here if you don't know the bingo?  I seriously considered burning the blank to play QUAGgA for 51 but passed and figured I'd just try to set up the open line, since I was sitting on one of the last 2 A's.  As for non bingo choies, 14D QUAD and 14D QUAG win the sim...but I don't know that I like those, given those unseen O's.
>Laurie_Cohen: IIP 8L I.PI +27 327
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGLNN E9 N.G +8 306
#note Yet another bingo I can't find.  This one is GANGLAND 13 E, which wins 58%.  Quackle despises this fish; without an I, I didn't want to hold onto the G.
>Laurie_Cohen: EEJ 13J .JEE +22 349
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADLNRT L12 D.L +8 314
#note Now the game slips away.  I'll give myself a pass for not knowing QUANDANG or GANGLAND...but this is the one I've studied and do know.  I kept looking for DIS words and couldn't think to look for TRI words.  TRINODAL wins 50%, and I know that the pool is GMNRTX? because Laurie told me post-mortem that she had all the vowels.  Depending on how the end game panned out I might have been able to win, or maybe not depending on her next move.  But this miss sealed my fate.  Not being able to see the bingo, I felt that all I could do was open a line and hope she couldn't hook it.  I gambled and lost.

#note At least I go out in style.  How can I find this, yet whiff on what should have been a much easier find in TR(I)NoDAL?
