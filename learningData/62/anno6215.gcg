#note Everything is pretty much as good as everything else if it back-hooks the Z.  J5 BUTE wins, with this play roughly 2-1/2 points behind.

#note Quackle prefers E8 JINX.  I didn't like the easy comebacks this play offered, but I didn't like my comeback chances if I held onto DLTY.  I felt that turning the extra tile was important...and I also didn't count on yet another difficult draw which made it difficult to take advantage of the breaks I was about to be given.  JINX sims at 17-1/2%, and this choice is at 15.

#note Now that's a break.  Too bad I can't take away KA.  Well, let me amend that.  I seriously considered NUT D13 to block, but once again - what happens if I do that and she does something like KA G3?  Then the board is this close to being dead and I lose that way. Sadly, I'll have to let her hit KA on the next turn and hope that if I turn tiles, I can play my way back into this.  This play sims second best (by less than one point) to 5E JUT(E), at 23%.  I don't like keeping 4 consonants if I can help it.

#note Didn't see 5G DEALT and felt that without an S in my rack this spot had to go.  5G plays would have been really cool...but the neurons weren't firing well enough to see those.

>Jim_Burlant: AADMNRT 4K AM +10 135
#note Assuming you don't see the 5G plays, what do you do here?  I felt that all I could really do was pepper the board with open lines and try to hit something.

#note Didn't know the 8 in this rack (MANDATOR) and obviously was also struggling with the board vision problem.

>Lynn_Dreyer: LPRSWWY -RSWWY +0 210
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFGIQT 2B QI +24 235
#note Quackle prefers the 9D placement by 1 point.  No matter - I'm now at 70% winning chances - unthinkable 2 turns ago, when I was sitting at 25.

#note My bingo keeps me in the game, but this is unbelievable - Lynn is the third straight opponent to draw straight into a bingo off of an exchange of at least 4 tiles.  FEINTING, which sims third behind k9 hEFTING and 13C LEFTwING, comes in at 40%.  
>Lynn_Dreyer: OUY N6 YOU +31 330
>Jim_Burlant: FGPSTUV M8 PUG +12 319
#note I felt that with all the vowels in the pool I could put this out there since I was sitting on the case S.    Sim says I should throw FGUV back into the bag.  I debated between this and exchanging and didn't feel I had the luxury of taking a doughnut on this turn.  The strategy does bear fruit despite the wretched leave...but I fail to take advantage of it.

>Jim_Burlant: ?FOSTVW 3A ViS +26 345
#note Quackle likes F4 VOW, claiming it wins 77%.  Not knowing that Lynn had not drawn the H, I was worried about shutting down something like HILI 3A, which I felt pretty much would have killed any of my winning chances.

>Jim_Burlant: FHIIOTW M13 FIT +22 367
#note Quackle is off here.  While I had plenty of time on my clock, I couldn't figure out the right sequence.  I was so befuddled by the awkward combination of letters and the presence of the three counters that I got too obsessed with clearing all the counters out before she went out in two.  HI M13 will win the game for me, as she's defenseless against it, and after that I would play TOW 15M 24, leaving IF.  This would have won by 9, but like I said, I just could't figure it out.
