>Jim_Burlant: AEHSTUX 8C EXHAUST +100 100
>Lewis_Saul: ILNO 9C LION +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: CINRRTW H4 WRIT. +12 112
#note I had planned to play CR(A)W F6 but LION killed that.  Didn't know most of the choices (WHORT E7 wins the sim) and felt I had to clear the W and duplicated R. 
>Lewis_Saul: DOV 6F VO.D +16 40
>Jim_Burlant: CEMNRRU 5H .ECUR +17 129
#note No really great options here - just trying to turn tiles, unload the U and duplicated R and see what comes up. Sim winner is E8 HOMER; like I said, I'd rather dump the U.
>Lewis_Saul: AOPR E3 PROA +21 61
>Jim_Burlant: AIMNORY 10F YOM +30 159
#note While YO 10F wins the sim, this choice is a close second.
>Lewis_Saul: IQ F2 QI +35 96
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNRR H10 .ARINE +27 186
#note 3 plays sim pretty much interchangeably here, though this play narrowly wins the sim at 1100 iterations:  G1 RIN, H10 MANNER, and this choice.
>Lewis_Saul: EKNPRSU 13C SPUNK.ER +90 186
>Jim_Burlant: EGINNRV 11G R.VENING +76 262
#note Almost missed this - was looking for a V dump when I saw this in a moment of inspiration.  This is the only playable bingo and it wins 82%.
>Lewis_Saul: EJNOOST -  +0 186
#note Lewis told me post-mortem that, the instant we got up to go to the adjudicator, he realized he had made a huge mistake challenging this play; he knew it would come back good.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEISTU 2F .UIETESt +68 330
#note Had no idea that RAVENING took an S.  While I cough up huge equity I'm now at 99%.  Best bingo is O7 cUTESIE for 84.  Coolest play would have been (R)EqUIS(I)TE L5 for 68, but I think I used up my quota of disconnected 9's for this tournament in round 2 against Laurie. :-)
>Lewis_Saul: BEIMO 12B BIOME +34 220
>Jim_Burlant: AABDOTZ 1H BOA +31 361
#note I take a mild hit for this choice.  Sim winner is 1M ADZ; I felt the Z could wait a turn while I killed row 1 bingos and potentially drew into a Z play at M9.
>Lewis_Saul: DEEGILO M6 LEGIO.ED +74 294
>Jim_Burlant: AACDITZ 1M ADZ +40 401
#note Wasn't sure about LEGIONED, but given the size of my lead and the fact that I had ADZ for 40 coming back, it would have been foolish to risk the challenge.  Quackle prefers CITADEL C3 and 11B ACTA to this.  But given my next draw I could have put anything down and it would have won.
>Lewis_Saul: DEFO 12L F.OD +33 327
>Jim_Burlant: ?AACILT 15A CALIfAT. +80 481
#note gLACIATE in the same location is best. 
>Lewis_Saul: AEHNT 4K NEATH +30 357
>Jim_Burlant: FGJLSTY 9L J.G +11 492
#note And if I look harder I score 33 for STYE instead of making this lame play.  This would have won me high game honors had I found this. Oh well, I get what I deserve.
