>Ryan_Fischer: AEELPTT 8D PALETTE +74 74
#note PELTATE, which I never learned, let alone can excuse myself for forgetting.  Not hookable*, so that's a plus.

>Ryan_Fischer: BEGGLUY --  -56 142
#note Needless to say, I was feeling phony happy today.  And the theme was NO ONE was buying 'em.  Sure, I got a few good words challenged, but I should be able to sneak something by someone SOMETIME.
>Anne_Hay: JO G13 JO +41 127
#note Oops.  And she overscored it by one.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEGGLUY 11H B.LGY +22 164
#note Saw BUG(E)Y(E).  Cute but doesn't eval well.  Best is BELUG(A); my play doesn't rank too high.

#note Lost challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: AABDOPU A8 BOA +34 335
#note And I was really lucky she challenged.  Figured I'd take the hottest spot, come back for the D.  Q don't likey, but whatev.

#note Oh well.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFPRRTU D8 .UTREF. +30 421
#note :)  (5E TURF's static eval is better, but only by 1 point, so I win for style!)
>Anne_Hay: AV -  +0 269
#note Lost challenge.  She thought it was the other way (PUTRIFY*).  I thought it might be both.  We're both wrong.  :)

#note Really fancy!  7H spot!  TERRAINS, TERRINES, REPRINTS, RENTIERS, you get the idea.  Oops.
>Anne_Hay: DEINSST K3 SNIDEST +76 359
#note Double oops.  My lack of spread, among other boneheadednesses, would come back to haunt me.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?INRSTW C6 .W +18 478
#note She couldn't have given me a vowel.  Pool is oogly, too.

#note O1 ReSIT.  Given I had like 8 seconds left when I played this, I was happy to just go out and not go over.
