#note this or 9a RIF (i think bnjy's last tile was an O).
>james: AFJMOQS 2B JO.AM +40 94
>bnjy: EOORRST 3B OR.TOR +33 90
#note a3 SOROR(A)TE, though ORATOR is a cute find - after i saw ORATOR come down and knowing ben had been shedding III's, i said to him i thought he was about to play ORATORIO.
>james: ABFLNQS 7A FAB +27 121
#note i'm glad this sims above shedding the Q.  it comes out top - my argument was that I didn't need to panic with the Q, and i hated only playing one tile this early in the game with so much good stuff still to come and playing the Q leaves myself with two tiles on my rack that just don't gel (FB).

#note H1 GUY hooking ORATORY is cute.
>james: EHLNQRS H1 HES +25 146
#note ok - do you want to hear the excuse for this one?  I played it thinking it was 37 points! Somehow I thought the H was worth 8, and figured it was too many points to give up.  Both bnjy and gijoel corrected me afterwards.
>bnjy: AEIIINS -III +0 90
#note i presume this was the leave - q slightly prefers INES as a leave
>james: ELNQRSW 8G Q. +22 168

>bnjy: AACENPS 1G C.AP +11 101

#note OMG.  can i defend myself here?  not really, i just didnt take long enuf to find ZEIN or ZERK.  (*blush*). 
>bnjy: AEILSTV D11 VI. +14 160
#note 2h (E)LATIVES or K1 ESTIVAL.  the former is a tough find imo. Ben saw ESTIVAL as he asked me after the game if i would have let go ESTIVALS*.
>james: ?AGINRU 15H .UGARINg +74 434
#note again, i get rewarded for a mistake by getting the exact tile i shouldn't have played on the previous turn. nice when that happens.
