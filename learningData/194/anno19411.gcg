>Sean_Wrona: FHOOQXZ 8H FOX +26 26
#note I don't remember why I chose this placement (just because I held the H?) and I probably wouldn't do it again.  It does apparently sim the best though.
>Kit_Morehead: GRU 9I RUG +17 17
>Sean_Wrona: EHLOQTZ K9 .LOZE +30 56
#note It doesn't sim the best but I don't want to play closed and leave a Q and Z on my rack.  I also want to play off more tiles to draw an I or a U.
>Kit_Morehead: AT L12 AT +28 45
>Sean_Wrona: EHLQTTW 13I WH..TLE +34 90
#note Whoops...I thought this was good.  She did hold this but let it go.
>Kit_Morehead: BEF O12 F.EB +39 84
>Sean_Wrona: IINQSTU 7G QI +26 116
#note How did I miss QUIT?  Major error.
>Kit_Morehead: ACO N11 CO.A +21 105
>Sean_Wrona: ILNNSTU 10F LUNT +9 125
>Kit_Morehead: MV G9 V.M +12 117
>Sean_Wrona: EGIINRS J13 .I +7 132
#note This is a lazy fish and I'm going to call it a major board vision error.  RIM is obviously a much better fish (and in my opinion better than RIME which sims the best).
>Kit_Morehead: EHNO 15H HONE +27 144
>Sean_Wrona: EGINRRS L3 RINGERS +73 205
#note Not a major error, but a costly one nonetheless since I could have kept her from bingoing by playing the higher-scoring RINGERS (which I didn't see - or maybe erroneously thought this was safer defensively?)  She then bingoed three times in a row and the game was esesntially over.
>Kit_Morehead: ?AEIKNU 14B UNAlIKE +79 223
>Sean_Wrona: ?BEEPTU E8 TUBE +19 224
#note I missed the BRINGERS hook and I missed PUB 15B, but I still like what this does to the board better (i.e. not blocking some of my potentially best bingo lines) than what the other plays do.
>Kit_Morehead: ADDEILT 5F TIDELA.D +70 293
#note I would say the other TIDELAND is better for defense in addition to scoring a bit more.
>Sean_Wrona: ?EEPRRS 4B REPRiSE +75 299
#note I think I was not at all sure whether TIDELAND took an S, and she did bingo there on the next turn.  At least she'd have had a third straight bingo either way even if I had played something with TIDELANDS.  I think playing the wrong RINGERS is likely where the game was lost.

Major word knowledge error.  PRISERE/TIDELANDS sims the best by quite a lot and I wasn't sure about TIDELANDS and I've never seen PRISERE before.
>Kit_Morehead: AAGINOS N1 AGNOSIA +81 374
>Sean_Wrona: EJN 1L JE.N +57 356
>Kit_Morehead: AWY O7 WAY +32 406
>Sean_Wrona: COP H1 COP.. +30 386
>Kit_Morehead: DIMOTY B2 DI.TY +34 440
#note She initially put down DORMY and I said hold before she hit her clock.  That's embarrassing for any number of reasons.
>Sean_Wrona: AADEIRV 8A AVER. +27 413
#note I'm not sure why this doesn't even make the list.  It's not like I can fish for a bingo here or have any chance of winning, and I do have multiple out spots after this...
>Kit_Morehead: IMOOS A1 MOO +20 460
>Sean_Wrona: ADI 12C AID +16 429
#note Ooh...IDEA is lovely and I'd be pinching myself if I'd found that.

Major errors (3): QI (board vision), HI (board vision), REPRISE (word knowledge)
