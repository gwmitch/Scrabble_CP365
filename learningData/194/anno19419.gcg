#note Probably POOED/OBIT although this is still okay I guess if PADI surprisingly sims the best (and why PADI instead of PAID)?

#note However, I was clearly asking for this when I left EOO last time.  As awful as Os often are, since I had so many (meaning there were fewer left in the pool), the OBIT hook is stil there and 8K is still there, I decided to keep an O here, but I'm not sure that's recommended.  I suppose I was being too clever here, but I still think it's acceptable, although tossing all four Os is probably better.

#note Ultimately it comes down to who draws the Z, I guess...  I probably should have played something on row 1 (AVULSE if I'd seen it, which I didn't) so she wouldn't have an easy play if she had the Z and the S, but she did.  I was lost after this play and maybe this isn't all that bad, and maybe I'm just judging this on the bad luck I had afterward...

#note I'm actually not sure there were any major errors in this one.  A bunch of minor ones which might have added up to a loss, however.  I think VENAL was probably a major error.  I didn't see AVULSE.  Having said that, if I play there and she has something like ZAS/MAPS, I still lose.  I doubt there's any real way I could ensure some win when she could have the Z and the S (even if I *knew* she had both).  I don't think I can beat myself up about this one for once.
