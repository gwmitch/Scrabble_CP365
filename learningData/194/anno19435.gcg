#note I see that he has TRAPPO(S)E but I can't figure out if I should have to worry about him knowing/seeing it. I know nothing about Eloy except that he is unrated in NASPA, he is 3-0 in this tournament, and he is rated 2000+ on ISC. 
Of course, none of that really matters because he also had PREADOPT which I totally oversaw.

#note I miswrote one tile on this rack
>Matt_Canik: ABIJLNR H1 BRIA. +24 245
#note What a weird turn. I d on't want to string open the side of the board. BRIAR opens 8s lines though... (T)AJ?
>Eloy_Gardea: EGIIMNO L2 MEN.IGO +24 163
#note IMINO 8K looks solid here.

#note And missed one here
>Matt_Canik: AEJNRUV 8A JURA +42 323
#note A 100 point bingo from the J would be devastating, but JURA is so strong that I think I need to play it

#note T(RE)A(T)Y/JURAT is a brautiful fit
