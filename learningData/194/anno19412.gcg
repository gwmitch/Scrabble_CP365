#note Wow, AERIE's probably better.  I clearly underestimated the difference between AH and AA as a leave.  (That's assuming I actually saw AERIE, which I might not have).

#note Well, this does appear in Merriam-Webster's unabridged but apparently is usually capitalized.  The vast majority of what I get on a Google search is references to Harry Potter characters.  As with WHETTLE in the previous game, is it an error if it sims well and isn't challenged?  Even so, the valid ARROW is likely better since at least I'd be keeping a consonant with the double A's...  It's close though.

#note Major play-finding error.  I was so preoccupied with blocking the low-scoring S spot I didn't look for other sorts of plays either, but I'm not sure I would have found and played HEADGATE or HEADSTAY.  ADAPTER looks really dangerous but AIRDATES seems nice.

#note I have a reputation for overfishing in some corners.  I don't really think this is accurate as I mainly do it when I can't think of anything better to do quickly enough, but here the obvious priority was aggressive defense (though I'd likely screw that up as I did in the Carol McDonald game).  I fished too long and gave her a bingo spot that just ceded control of the game to her despite me luckboxing her.

At the very least, GOA is better here as it scores more points and is much more defensive with the same leave.  *This* is actually not a major error though.  It was doing it consistently that became one.  I suppose this play is actually more defensive than I think it is as well.

>Sean_Wrona: ADEINSY 11I D.Y +24 236
#note Too unbalanced a leave to be best (I know that keeping 3 vowels in a 5-letter leave is always much worse than I think it is), but not completely dreadful.  The bad part is that I'm blocking a lane I can use more than what I'm leaving.
>Heather_McCall: EO 10F OE +18 176
>Sean_Wrona: AEIINNS 11E IN +10 246
#note At this point, I think the fishing has gone too far.  Once again, as with the previous fishes, the play itself doesn't sim too bad (although AIN is presumably better).  However, I'm conditioning the board so that it comes down to whoever bingos first when I should be *ensuring* that she doesn't bingo.

>Sean_Wrona: AEIILNS L4 NIL +15 261
#note At *exactly* the wrong moment, I start getting paranoid at never hitting my fishes and decide I now need to block.  However there's no way to do this and leave a good rack.  Maybe I should have just given up on bingoing completely and played SALINE/PRIMES.  This score + leave is horrible and the defensive considerations aren't worth it.  Major strategic error, but maybe this was the only one (even though my previous fishes weren't likely best).  This was a costly one, however (it did block one of the two spots where she could have bingoed as it turns out).  Even *this* doesn't sim very badly although I missed NISEI which is a better and higher-scoring block.  But I still think it is much worse than the sim makes it appear to be.  I don't really buy this as any kind of top five play and it cost me the game.  Or maybe IN did, but if I'd played AIN there (which was correct) she'd still be able to bingo.

#note I suppose I kept the I and a vowel-heavy leave because there was only one I left while most of what was left was consonants, and after all that I obviously needed to bingo.  I still probably should have thrown the I back.  Actually, even this far behind, IODISE is the only thing worth doing, especially because there are a *lot* of esses left.  Did I see the play though?  If I'd seen it I probably wouldn't have played OIDIAE.  Major play-finding error compounded on a strategic error (keeping a poor leave).
>Heather_McCall: ASUV N9 VAUS +16 338
#note Game, set, match.
>Sean_Wrona: AAEIILS 3K .AI +10 271
#note Why do I keep leaving one more vowel when I usually have higher-scoring plays that allow me to play the vowel off?  Admittedly, this gives me the possibility to play RAIA or RAIL or RAIS so this might still be best at this point.

>Sean_Wrona: AEILSST 14B .A +5 276
#note Oh, hahaha.  Wow.  This is exactly what I did in the next game where I missed the bingo in the spot I had set up.  Perhaps these were both lost due to negative thinking?  If I'm going to fish AGAIN I probably need to play US instead (since there is only one e left).  But still, SALTIES probably doesn't win anyway, but it's still a horrific miss.  Massive error.  And dumping the last A as a fish (probably because I'm expecting to draw an N for LISTENS - but drawing an N for ELASTIN would be a lot better.  US or RAIS are the only fishes worth doing, but SALTIES is the only play worth doing.  Absolutely HORRIFIC.  I'm better than this, but what is it going to take for me to finally prove it to others?)

#note Wow.  I didn't even know this rack had bingos...  This is looking even worse and worse.  Like worse than the Susan Kirchhausen game worse.  US would have been a better thing to do last turn than this turn.  I was clearly *lucky* to not lose by 100 when I by all rights should have won by more than 100, had I played proper defense.  Disgusting.

#note Major errors (6): ANSATED (play-finding), NIL (strategic), OIDIAE* (word knowledge), exchange (play-finding), YA (board vision), US (word knowledge)

Absolutely pathetic.
