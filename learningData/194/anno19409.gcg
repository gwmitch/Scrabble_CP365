#note appears the two placements rated as equal

#note instead of faze.  because I'm a bad persuhn.
>Thomas_Reinke: AFSY K3 FAYS +35 151
>me: EFHIIIY 10N HI +28 156
#note HELP!  IFFY rated 11 pts higher.  What's they key factor -leave?  Maybe the fact that the HI dump isn't likely to get taken if I need it over the next couple turns? 
>Thomas_Reinke: TTW 4I TW.T +14 165
>me: EFIIIOY 10J YO +33 189
#note HELP!   YO scores 11 more than (F)IEF, yet valuates at 11 pts less, nd despite my leave hanging onto a consonant.   Is it opening up row 11 that makes mine so inferior?
>Thomas_Reinke: ETW 11I WET +32 197
>me: AEFIIIN -AEIIIFN +0 189
#note This actually rates third best.  (F)IEF once again best.
>Thomas_Reinke: EIPR E8 ..PIRE +20 217
>me: ?AAOSUV 3G VAU +14 203
#note HELP!   AVO at 2J rated best, where as Quackle called my play a stink bomb.  I know I'm behind, but AVO just seems ripe for Thomas to hammer. Thoughts?
>Thomas_Reinke: AEGNO 12D O.ANGE +23 240
>me: ?AAIORS O1 rASORIA. +74 277
#note 2nd best to AbROSIA, 2H
>Thomas_Reinke: ?EEIIMT 1H TIMElIE. +74 314
>me: ADFNOSX N5 OX +52 329
#note HELP!    Only 3 pts and 3% win difference, but why does Quackle indicate AX is better?   Two O's unseen to me to one A.  I assumed trying to stay duplicate-free was good idea.
>Thomas_Reinke: CH M1 .CH +16 330
>me: ADFIINS 13B FIN. +16 345
#note FIND, 14B scores adozen more but vauation advantage only haf that.  Still, another gaffe.
>Thomas_Reinke: CEJNT O10 .NJECT +69 399
#note Thiomas' annotation notes indicate he fished for this.  To my surprise, Quackle never indicates I should've blocked this possibility.
>me: ADGILRS 13M AG. +8 353
#note I thought this worked for being a tremendous bingo lane-opener and fish.  Quackle rated it as a dumpster fire, preferring LAD at 14A by -41- valuation pts. and dpouble the % chance to win.
>Thomas_Reinke: ADO 13H ODA +18 417
>me: DEILRRS B13 .IR +12 365
#note HELP!  It's on the board, butQuackle indicates LAR at M4 gives me a surprising 40% chance to win, MUCH higher than anything else.  How is it so high when is a 70% chance that opp has the other S?
