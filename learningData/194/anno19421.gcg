#note Wrong word, right spot.  I'm pretty sure I know COTED is good and pretty sure I knew that then.  This is borderline as to whether it's a major error or not, but I'll say no (only just barely though).  However, it seems like most of my games are more about consistently finding good but not best plays (apart from the all-too-frequent games when I have meltdowns) and then going 'oh duh' when I see what the best play is while simming.

#note Okay, I can see why DUD sims the best.  It doesn't open another bingo line while this does and it keeps ING, although I really wanted to get rid of the G since I'm not sure what kind of value ING has when the most open tile *is* a G...  I don't think this is a major error, but I should have been more defensive than this I suppose.

>Sean_Wrona: AEILOTU 7C .EU +13 178
#note A bad play because it doesn't really do anything.  It's like I was preoccupied with *not opening* any bingo lines at all costs that I didn't end up blocking them.  EULOGIA opens up a lot but there's a good chance it's right since it blocs ZIGS and LIKENS.  Major board vision error.  If I'd played OUTLIE/OE/UN instead, that would have kept him from bingoing.  Or if I'd challenged his bingo...
>Curtis_Lee: ABBILNO 12H BOBNAIL +87 183
#note Oh, so he came back via a phony.  I guess I did choke it then.  At least he likely thought it was good because when I hooked it later he didn't challenge.
>Sean_Wrona: AILOOTW 11I WAIL +30 208
#note I missed ALOW.  I guess it's better but it doesn't thrill me at all.   think I'm for WOOED or WOOLED looking at all the options.

>Sean_Wrona: CLNOORW J3 CROW +32 333
#note I guess I need to play ROW to set up something with the C on the next turn.  I guess this is a major strategic error but it seems like it's really easy for him to take that spot in response with FROW, PROW, or TROW, and then what do I do with the C?
>Curtis_Lee: EF 3C EF +19 320
>Sean_Wrona: AAHILNO N6 HAIL +19 352
#note With the blank and S remaining, I assumed he likely had a bingo, but the real priority here apparently was scoring, and HALLOA (which I certainly know is a word and knew at the time) largely shuts down the bingo line and scores.  This just doesn't score enough.  Major strategic error, and apparently the scoring difference is enough for this to in fact be a choke (because I was obsessed with him scoring bingos rather than his scoring opportunities, and I needed to play off more tiles to potentially draw the blank).
>Curtis_Lee: AEEPST O1 PESETA +32 352
>Sean_Wrona: AIIINOY N2 YIN +26 378
#note I already had no chances to win on the last turn, so it's hard to say what happened here.  I mean, HALLOA also would have had risks as he would likely have scored higher than PESETA hooking HALLOAS, although my lead would have been slightly larger so I'd have a bit better of a chance.  At least this time there was nothing I could have done on this turn to salvage the game that I missed (although AYIN is a miss), but there must have been something I could have done on previous turns.  Probably the main thing is BOBNAIL.  I'd never seen that before for a reason...

Major errors (4): JEU (board vision), BOBNAIL (allowed phony bingo), CROW (I guess), HAIL (strategic error)
