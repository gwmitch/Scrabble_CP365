#note Now I was faced with a pivotal decision. Do I want a more open board against Eric, or do I want a closed one? I think Eric is good on closed boards, although he doesn't really like them, and our last game ended in a tie on a very closed board, but I felt confident I could outplay him if the board stayed closed, since I had a bad leave. Because of that I decided to play this instead of, say, B(O)UGIE, B(O)UT, (O)UTBEG or (A)UGITE, which all lead to more open boards than this. I failed, though, to consider I6 GIT, which also seems like a fine option, but I think I like my play better.

#note well damn, seems he likely has another S... Wasn't expecting that nor could I predict it...
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIIRTU 4F G..UTI +9 48
#note Hoping either a) he doesn't have an s, b) he does and will waste it for not a lot of points, or c) he doubts the validity of GOMUTIS, because I'm in serious serious trouble now. I probably should have just played 4D IDI(OM) here, but I believe I missed it. It's that or exchange everything, or play this. I like this still, since it induces the most potential for error on my opponent's part, be it from inferring I have an S I don't have or doubting GOMUTIS.

#note Nothing else that makes sense besides this, unfortunately.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADEFORU 2H OAF +28 94
#note I didn't know the other option here, DOURA(H). I also didn't really see why I should play 2I OF over this, since either way I have to hope that I draw something and that my opponent can't respond, but apparently I bingo more often with ADERU than with DERU, which makes sense, given (ET)A. But yeah, DOURA(H) is totally the play here. Medium error.

#note Darn, again one of, if not the worst possible outcome of my play, since I can't hook OF or bingo with it.

#note Is he going to choke? Whoa! Nah, I'm just gonna make a move that never wins instead of a move that can win. 10E LI hits (O)RPHICAL C12 possibly, that's probably the play.
