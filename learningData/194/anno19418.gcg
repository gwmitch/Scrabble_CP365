#note If I went to such effort to set up the FURORE hook (as I believe I did) I needed to at least play there.  Everything worth playing is there, but I didn't look there perhaps because I wanted to leave it open and make sure I had two spots to bingo?  I wasn't behind by nearly enough to make that argument.  Major strategic error.

#note And with this I make it easy for him to close the board and hard for me to bingo in the near future.  This sims better than I think it actually is.  I think this is probably a major error even though it sims well.  If he plays in row 7 or row 9, where do I bingo?  If I hook FURORE that gives me a lot more options...

#note Basically the worst case scenario.  Game over.
>Sean_Wrona: DEEELLM 8A MELEE +28 142
#note I missed ELIDE and I think it's better.  Not a major error though.

#note Major rack vision error.  I probably wouldn't be completely certain of DUALISMS but had I seen it, I would do it.

#note Okay, PALSIED is better, probably because of the triple scoring defense (anything starting with EK, EV, EW, or EX is bad, and that's not all that improbable, not to mention X crosswords).  Did I know that entire set on lockdown though?  I think so.  While this was a mistake, I don't think it was a major one (while I *do* think THRONE was a major mistake, even though it came closer in terms of winning percentage than this did).

#note I was wondering why CONI was so much better then I instantly remembered CONIN.  I'm going to call this a major board vision error.  Although the odds of me winning after bingoing after CONI aren't very good either, that is certainly way superior and I saw all the anagrams here and just didn't think of the CONIN hook.

Major errors (4): WOE (strategy), THRONE (strategy), US (rack vision), COIN (board vision)

Some would disagree that THRONE and COIN were major at all, but I think they were...
