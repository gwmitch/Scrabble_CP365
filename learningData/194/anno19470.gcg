#note MT: TEIID is simming a little better. Thought I might need the FORESEE hooks.

#note MT: Took me a long while to see this. Thought he blocked all my bingos

#note MT: I spent quite a long time here trying to find something better than the bingo. But the non-bingo options suck, and the pool is risky.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEMNOSY 1A MONEY +38 348
#note MT: 1G EMEND is the play I was looking for. MONEY opens bingo lines. Not a huge error, but a miss.

#note MT: Another tricky pre-endgame. RAZEED and MADERIZE are the threats. 75% of the time when he has RAZEED, he also has MADERIZE. So blocking RAZEED is not as automatic a play as I thought. I can actually play short here to try and draw a bingo to beat his RAZEED/MADERIZE. Or play short blocking MADERIZE and try to race RAZEED without a bingo. But I dunno if it's wise to give him more chances to fish for his win. Better to empty the bag I think. Or not? Frig I don't know.
