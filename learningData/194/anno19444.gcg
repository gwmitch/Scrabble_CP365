#note MT: It probably didn't help that I hesitated for 3 minutes. I just couldn't remember if this was a TWL word. I think even if I knew it was CSW I'd still try it, since it's so much better than my other plays and John is supposed to be the one with dictionary confusion. But he's not, he knows his stuff and I don't.

#note MT: Over BAULK to make the board a little less  bingo-friendly

#note MT: RAMADAS the better defensive play

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEGOPR O10 .ARAGE +27 214
#note MT: Hmm... I can block the G without blowing up my rack. 9L APO and O8 GAGA are options. They score lower though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABEOOOS 3A OBOE +17 268
#note MT: This is a little too reckless. A lot of the time, it sets John up for a bunch of points and I'm suddenly in need of a bingo. The unseen pool has some garbage, so John might have crap. Be patient and play 9L ABO or something
>John_O'Laughlin: EFFIIRT 4D RIFF +32 328
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AANOSSY L12 NA.Y +28 296
#note MT: Keeping the board openish
>John_O'Laughlin: EIIOTTZ 3I ZIT +48 376
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAIORSS L8 OA. +4 300
#note MT: I burned most of the rest of my clock here before hurriedly keeping the best leave I could. It wasn't until next turn that I realized I blocked both my S-fishes and scored too low to stay in bingo range. I need to score here. The sim says 11H OSSA which burns my esses but also makes that not matter. I'm in big trouble regardless, but I cost myself whatever shot I had
