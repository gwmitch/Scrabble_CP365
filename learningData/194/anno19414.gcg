#note I can understand why this sims worse than exchanging all 7 (since the only vowels on the board are Es making an E harder to use) but I can't understand why keeping EI sims as well/better.

I did write down time remaining after each play, but I'm not going to report them since I don't think I'm getting that much out of it.  Instead, I'm going to try to focus on looking for error trends that need to be fixed.

#note I agree that JEU is easily better.  The spot this opens up makes it unworthy even if I do hold the last H.  Board vision error

#note We'll call this a word knowledge error since I don't know CENTUMS, but surely this is a far stupider fish than CUM/MAY which I missed (board vision error).

#note THIS fish however was a very smart one.  Does it matter whether I play NIP or PIN here at all?

>Sean_Wrona: ACEERST B3 ECARTES +67 205
#note This sims about equally with CREATES, so perhaps I overestimated how much value there was in playing ECARTES to leave the quadrant open rather than completely shutting it down.  I would still always do this though.

#note I missed PODIA.  I still like this better.

>Sean_Wrona: DEFLOOT N10 FEOD +36 279
#note Almost everything worth doing is in row 3 but I still might do this because the of-->oft hook appealed to me.  Unfortunately, there are 3 other t's left besides mine which I'm not sure I had noticed meaning maybe that's not such a good thing to do.  I'm going to call this a rack management error since I need to bingo and LOT is not likely to do it.  I ended up doing so regardless, but since he also bingoed, it was completely meaningless.

Misscored as 33.

#note I then missed the higher-scoring outplay.  Board vision error.  I don't consider it particularly major though.

Major errors (3): EAU (board vision), MU (word knowledge), FEOD (rack management)
