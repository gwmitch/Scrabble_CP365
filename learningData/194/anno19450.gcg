#note Type a note here! Chris reported that he saw he could play AMORIST at 14F, but he felt his chances of winning were better by playing AMORT, "followed by a lucky bingo". A lengthy sim (more than 5000 iterations) showed that the two plays were almost identical (within 1/10 of a percentage point) with regard to winning percentage.
