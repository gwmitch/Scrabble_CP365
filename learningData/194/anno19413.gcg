>Vicki_Kahn: AEFNNR 8D FANNER +26 26
>Sean_Wrona: ADEEKOT D8 .AKED +26 26
#note OKE seems obvious now so why did I not consider it then?  Admittedly, this is acceptable.
>Vicki_Kahn: BEMPU I3 BUMPE. +16 42
>Sean_Wrona: EIIOTTT J4 TOIT +20 46
#note I missed BIOTITE but I still wouldn't play it.
>Vicki_Kahn: EO K5 OE +19 61
>Sean_Wrona: AEHITUU 10B HA.U +19 65
#note HAUT C11 sims the best?  Somebody explain that to me because I don't get it.  Maybe I just didn't run enough iterations (slightly less than 300) because I want to get this done faster.

>Vicki_Kahn: NOX 11B OX.N +40 184
>Sean_Wrona: DEIIMTT C9 T..ITE +34 99
#note I didn't consider TAXIED and MAXED but still like this better.  I think I need to hope for an S at this point.  Misscored as 33.
>Vicki_Kahn: BLL 14B B.LL +12 196
>Sean_Wrona: ADEIMOS F3 DAIMO.ES +83 182
#note I put one of the other bingos down in the same spot but don't remember which one.  I switched to this because it scored more and (especially) because I thought it would draw a challenge since DAIMONE is not a word.
>Vicki_Kahn: INNV -  +0 196
#note It did.

>Vicki_Kahn: HPU C2 PU.H +18 228
>Sean_Wrona: AEEIILS K8 ILEA +11 262
#note Hahaha, how did I miss IDEAL using the same letters and leaving open more spots for me to potentially bingo (including the VENINE/VENINS hook which she is unlikely to be able to use)?  Major board vision error.
>Vicki_Kahn: EV 10J V.E +14 242
>Sean_Wrona: EEFIJOS 15A JO +31 293
>Vicki_Kahn: ?AEGOOS 13F .OOtAGES +68 310
#note I was not too worried about that particular bingo line but um...I guess I should have been?  And had I not played ILEA on the previous turn, this would have been much easier to block with some play with VENINE.
>Sean_Wrona: EEFINST 12L FEN +24 317
#note Should I have played FE instead?  I don't think so since that seems a lot easier to block since I am holding the last S and she can only play through the N to block now.  However, with the Cs remaining, it's likely she'll eventually be able to block.  Okay, I wrote that before I simmed and FEN sims much better as I would have expected it would.  *This* was not the error heard round the world.
>Vicki_Kahn: ARY 14H RAY +30 340
>Sean_Wrona: EGILRST J12 G.. +7 324
#note I did almost everytihng right in this game.  This was one of my best-played games in the tournament so far and then THIS happens.  I *saw* GLISTER/GRISTLE in my rack but convinced myself they didn't fit on the board so I um...fished again.  This is on par with anything in the previous game and although one could argue it was my only major mistake, this is a major mistake that killed.  Astoundingly misscored as 6.
>Vicki_Kahn: ACIR N8 CAIR. +9 349
>Sean_Wrona: EGILRST 15G LEG +24 348
#note I drew the exact same rack again and now I can't bingo with it and she has the Z.  I do think I maximized my points with the LEG + STIR sequence, but there isn't a win.  Had she missed ZOIC/AZOIC and instead played something like ZAP or ZA through the A in CAIRN, I win doing this, but I didn't think she'd make that mistake.
>Vicki_Kahn: ACITZ 2K Z.IC +30 379
#note She was thinking of hooking ZOIC to play AZOIC later.  Neither of us thought of AZOTIC.  This was still enough for her to win...just barely.
>Sean_Wrona: IRST O12 STIR +23 371
#note Major errors (2): ILEA (board vision), GAY (monstrous board vision error)

After back-to-back games I had no business losing yet managed to, I was in a very sour mood that never lifted for the rest of the tournament even though I won fairly regularly for the next 10 games or so.
