>Sean_Wrona: EGHITUW 8D WEIGHT +34 34
#note Okay, I can see why keeping the T to use as a hook later is obviously preferred, and I can also see how the other location of WEIGHT simmed better.  It would have been a much better idea to put the W on the star I think, especially considering he bingoed through the H.  Not a major error though.
>Wes_Eddings: ?AEGILN H1 NArGILE. +89 89
>Sean_Wrona: CIILNUU 4C CLUIN. +18 52
#note CUING, duh (although they actually simmed almost identically).  This is how I lose.  Small error after small error after small error.  Well, I suppose it's better than making large ones.  I don't really like exchanging though.
>Wes_Eddings: GM E3 G.M +12 101
>Sean_Wrona: BIRTUVY E7 V.RITY +24 76
#note Board vision error - failed to consider WEIGHTY hook.  This one's major.
>Wes_Eddings: EX 6H .EX +26 127
>Sean_Wrona: ABEISTU D10 TUBA +30 106
#note Okay, BEAU is better because of the BEAUT hook which I missed.  I'm still not going to call that a major error though because after all TUBA takes a TUBAE hook as well.  But yes, I understand why BEAU is better.
>Wes_Eddings: AOT C11 OAT +21 148
>Sean_Wrona: AAAEIRS 5J AA +13 119
#note I understand AVA since AA opens up a bingo line that he could potentially use but if I have a 7-letter bingo that doesn't start with S on the next turn and no 8s with an additional letter, I'm in serious trouble, so I still like this better even though it simmed 2nd.
>Wes_Eddings: EN F12 EN +11 159
>Sean_Wrona: ADEIRSU 1E URA.IDES +60 179
#note Why did I not play RESIDUA on this turn after setting up the spot?  Durrrr...  Major rack vision error I guess.  I mean I instantly saw this before simming this position, and I was like 'What?'  This is even more valuable because he is fishing.
>Wes_Eddings: ACEINPS L3 INSCAPE +81 240
>Sean_Wrona: EFNPRSV 3K F.VE +20 199
#note Ugh...  At least this is still fairly acceptable but no matter what I do here it's dangerous.  FAVE actually sims better and I suppose I can see that since the S can be in any position if I draw into a bingo, but I liked that FIVE also allowed for the possibility of FIVER.

>Wes_Eddings: BEOO O8 BOOE. +24 297
>Sean_Wrona: KNPRSTZ N2 Z.RK +34 247
#note Wow, just wow.  Major rack vision error.  Nertz!
>Wes_Eddings: ?EFIOST 14I FOISTEd +87 384
#note I deserve that.
>Sean_Wrona: HLNPRST K9 PHT +21 268
#note NTH at 14A, which I didn't see, supposedly has 25 times higher winning chances (0.25 to 0.01) but that's assuming that Wes wouldn't automatically hit the triple on the next play, which he would, so this probably isn't particularly worse than anything else.  I need to randomly draw some vowels regardless.

>Sean_Wrona: ALW C6 AW +20 354
#note This actually sims better than immediately going out with WALY?  Cool, so I can argue missing that wasn't an error...
>Wes_Eddings: EII 2A .IE +8 433
