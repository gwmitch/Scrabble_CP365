#note Well, this is embarrassing. I knew there was something in this rack, but I smacked this down in a few seconds instead of the actual valid 2x2. He held for a few minutes but then ultimately let it go. I should've thought abount NASCENT and remembered that it couldn't be ENCANTED. Lucky to get away with it.

#note The duck prefers OBI at J4, but I'd prefer to take out the N, T and R to force him to have an 8 through the E or a 7 ending in S. I've also got an S so I'm not harming my own chances.

#note I was well aware when I made this exchange that Quackle would probably hate it, and sure enough it does prefer playing VILE at H12. VILE blocks the TWS lane on the bottom and scores well, plus I could just change the Us plus whatever other potential junk I draw next turn. Could also have just played ULU.

#note 1G ERUVIM sims highest. I understand that it scores more points, but I don't want to unnecessarily open up the board. After my play I can probably lock down the top right in one turn and make his life very difficult. 11D GIVER scores more than my play, accomplishes the same goal of blocking things up, plus turns over more tiles to get closer to the end of the game. I'd probably go with that in retrospect.
>Michael_Fagen: AELRU H3 URAL..E +8 219
>Jesse_Matthews: AEPRUVZ 2G PREZ +43 336
#note This takes out the R hook he has just created, makes it very difficult to bingo on Line 1 (unless he has RETABLO or something similar), and keeps the V for blocking purposes next turn
>Michael_Fagen: AEX 3F EA.X +42 261
>Jesse_Matthews: AADNOUV 1E AVO +11 347
#note His last play made the top line very dangerous, so it's in my best interest to immediately take it out. Quackle recommends 6D NAVAL without inferences, and even after I give various stem bingos as inferential racks to Quackle it still prefers NAVAL to AVO. This is a head scratcher to me...any ideas?

>Jesse_Matthews: ADNSTUY O3 DUTY +14 361
#note Yes, I saw DYNAST. I chickened out because I wasn't 100% sure that 1) it was valid and 2) it was valid in both dictionaries. The last thing I wanted to do was have a high scoring play challenged off on this critical turn and lose the game because of it, so I went with this inferior play that I knew 100% was a valid word.

#note I see no possible bingos from the opening he's just made, so I decide to start maximizing my points with this consonanty rack.
