#note This is neck and neck with 5B RAIA for one less point. ENR is a slightly better leave but I really don't like the easy points that RAIA gives back

#note Perhaps the most ridiculous draw of my tournament.

#note In game I was annoyed that Dean had blocked HORNFEL*, but I learned later on that HORNFELS is a sticky S word, so it's a good thing he did block it, because I would've played it without hesitation!

My play and HEREOF at 2E for one more are neck and neck in the sim. There are lots of Es left to draw, but I like keeping the ER? leave here over the N? leave
>Dean_Saldanha: ITTW J4 WITT. +13 100
#note Dean is clearly drawing junk.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEEINR B8 INDExER +76 342
#note While it's the highest scoring choice available, it's unnecessarily risky and greedy. I don't need to get a huge spread because of my tie, so INHERED is perfectly fine here.
>Dean_Saldanha: BIMRTU 13A T.RBIUM +28 128
>Jesse_Matthews: DEIISSZ 4J .IZ +30 372
#note Highest simming options is H13 SEZ for 48, which I did see but ultimately passed on. Didn't want to leave the Z in the TWS lane for him to potentially score big. If that's my logic though, then I should definitely play WIZES instead. With all of those Es to draw and another S remaining afterwards, why not play it?
>Dean_Saldanha: ?AEPQU 1J oPAQUE +52 180
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEIRSS M1 .IS +24 396
#note At this point no matter what I play it'll be painfully obvious that my tiles are good. I didn't want to blow up my rack by playing H10 RAISED or 15A ASIDE (both of which sim higher due to their higher scores), but I see the wisdom in it.
>Dean_Saldanha: ACLY 14G ACYL +15 195
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEEERS A11 DE.ER +28 424
#note Given all the Es remaining, I need to play off one or even two. It's either my play or L4 ZEES at the top of the list, but I opt for points in the end.

#note It's this or B2 AGIO for more points. I know Dean will surely try to block the Row 11 bingo lane so I wanted to create another lane for 7s starting with S without emptying the bag. I wasn't 100% sure that there were no 7s or 8s available for him or else I would've played AGIO. Based on it simming so highly I'll assume that there are no bingos for Dean even after I play AGIO.
>Dean_Saldanha: HKNO 11I HONK +27 262
>Jesse_Matthews: AEGLNST 15J ANGELS +29 493
#note Dean makes a great play to block my out bingo, so I take the points.
