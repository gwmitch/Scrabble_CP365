#note CYANIDES. (-3) As of this move, I have played more than 20% of the consonants I will draw this game. This is my final rack with fewer than four of them.
>Swen: CEIIKSS 9H SICKIES +68 89
>Carl: AEHIIVV D2 VIVI. +24 102
#note SHAVIE N9 was no longer in my lexicon. Although SHAVIE is 16 points more, VIVID is only 7 points back in the sim. There's value in unloading the Vs, and the H is a very valuable tile on this board.

#note Maybe I'm getting old, but I don't know if I'll ever come to terms with WUZ being added. I feel unclean playing it.
>Swen: NRT 12C T.RN +8 191
>Carl: BEOOOUY 6J BUOY +28 220
#note OBOE 6I sims best. I'm not so sure about that. Swen clearly has a lot of consonants (hell, they gotta be somewhere), and he'll be able to play parallel to OBOE easily. BUOY is most costly when Swen has drawn the X after TURN. He definitely didn't have it already, else XI/XU C12. Also, BUOY leaves WOO 11D for next turn, whereas there's not much to be done with OUY in this board. (-4?)
>Swen: X K5 X. +18 209
#note Could have been a lot worse.
>Carl: EFFOOOT 11D .OOF +28 248
#note Strangely, the weird letters aren't at all hindering me. Here, I get 28 points plus likely 31 points next turn with FE 10F.

>Carl: AAAEENT 1G ANTE +17 299
#note EATEN 1G wins the sim handily. I figured that the bag was so consonant heavy that it was better to keep the E. I clearly overcompensated.
>Swen: DG 4L D.G +10 274
#note Swen huffed and showed me that, after struggling for several turns, he actually drew back DG after DUG. Sick!
>Carl: AAEEHNO 10F HE +32 331
#note Meanwhile, I'm astonished to have drawn two more vowels after ANTE. I considered CHOANA J9, but didn't want to give Swen all those vowels to play through. What I like about CHOANA is that if Swen doesn't bingo in the next few turns, he never will. If he doesn't have an E, I've got a big score next turn, and I'm turning over tiles going for the blank. But from the way Swen has been playing, he probably already has it. As unhappy as he is with re-drawing DG, it's not too farfetched that he'd have a bingo to go with it if I give him some lanes, whereas after HE, his only option is 14E, which presumably he can't use, or he'd have used it last turn. This seems like a very difficult choice.
>Swen: GT N7 G..T +7 281
>Carl: AAAEENO 5J A. +17 348
#note Two more vowels!! Quackle exchanges here, but that seems foolish. By now, I'm certain Swen has been struggling with a blank and too many consonants, and exchanging will often mean drawing the Q while he safely bingos. On the other hand, by playing short, he'll often get stuck with the Q after he bingos. I also need to worry about something like SQUEG H11. But he definitely didn't have that Q last turn. It's still out there somewhere.
>Swen: D B13 .D +6 287
#note Uh-oh. This is why (C)HOANA seems like a worthy choice. Play CHOANAE next turn and the board can be shut down for good thereafter. But does it justify the initial risk?
>Carl: AABEENO K9 .AE +14 362
#note You really can't trust Quackle here. The duck is going to overvalue the possibility of drawing the blank or S. Swen has been fishing all this time with something, and he's clearly very close to a bingo. I actually considered AI 3C, just in case he drew the Q after ED. The best tile I can draw looks to be the P, because I can play PE(ED) (R)E(TURN) and take out the hook if he doesn't use it himself. 
>Swen: M 5I M.. +12 299
#note Over the past ten turns, Swen has turned over just 23 tiles. Only two of them were vowels, and they were both Us. Miserable. 
>Carl: ABEINOQ 3C Q. +22 384
#note The I is my 30th vowel of the game (out of 42 possible). That's good news because it means that Swen doesn't have it himself. But alas, I also draw the Q, and my hand is forced. Fortunately, I've managed to cobble together enough of a lead that I'll outrun most or all of his bingos. 
>Swen: ?AELNRS 15B SLANdER +75 374
>Carl: ABEGINO 14G BEGONIA +68 452
#note Surprise! This was the best possible sequence given the pool after QI. Swen's bingo is as weak as possible. Meanwhile, I draw the only non-blank tile to yield an outbingo, and stick him with the letter that otherwise would have been most helpful for him. Overall, this was a deceptively lucky game!
