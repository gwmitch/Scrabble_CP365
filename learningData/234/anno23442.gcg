>Lloyd_Mills: BJO 8G JOB +24 24
#note Lloyd is a 2000+ player I didn't get to play in Port Clinton so I was looking forward to oppurtunity to play him when I saw we were paired.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOORW 9G OWE +28 28
#note Best play!
>Lloyd_Mills: ART 10E RAT +15 39
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENORTW 11D WETA +31 59
#note 4th best play! Quackle likes the AENRT leave with WO for 21 at 7H. I went for the points. REWAN at 11D scores the most at 36. I didn't see it. -5.3
>Lloyd_Mills: AEGINRT 10I TEARING +67 106
#note GRATINE and GRANITE score one more for Llloyd but slotting an E is far riskier than slotting a G. I think this is correct.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADNORST 12C ROD +22 81
#note OOF! SANDWORT at D7. That's hard to see. I was disappointed DIATRONS didn't by one square. A tricky find for sure, but I know this word and I need to execute. Mine is the 4th best play. -43.2
>Lloyd_Mills: FKOY L8 FO.KY +38 144
#note Sadly I held this. It looked phony and I had bad memories of alan Stern playing the phony PUCKY on me during Nationals. FORKY is good and I accepted.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ANNSTUZ 8L .UTZ +48 129
#note Best play!
>Lloyd_Mills: CIU N6 CU.I. +13 157
>Jonathan_Lindh: AANNSVV 7H VAV +26 155
#note Best play!
>Lloyd_Mills: IPU B12 PIU +17 174
>Jonathan_Lindh: AHLNNSY H11 SHALY +53 208
#note Best play!
>Lloyd_Mills: ALS J5 LA.S +22 196
>Jonathan_Lindh: EMMNNRR G13 MEM +26 234
#note Ugly draw! MM I12 for 23 is best equity play but both blanks are out and since I'm not drawing well, I want the points and I want to seal this board as much as possible. Mine is 6th best and -2.7 to Quackle but I think it's best given the circumstances. Scores the most too!
>Lloyd_Mills: FILS K4 FILS +30 226
>Jonathan_Lindh: CNNORRT 4K .RONT +18 252
#note Best play! I get a bad stroke of luck next turn however.
>Lloyd_Mills: OX I12 OX +42 268
#note MM would have prevented that.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDEGGNR 13A G.EN +20 272
#note This was hideous. Quackle likes J10 EGG but I need to score more and bingoing is almost impossible on this board. Mine is 10th best and -11.8 but appropiate on this board. Takes out an easy scoring spot and scores the most out of all plays.
>Lloyd_Mills: DEEIINT 3L EN +10 278
#note Uh oh! Lloyd probably picked up one or both of the blanks and or the last S. This is bad.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABCDEPR 2J CAP +18 290
#note Another difficult turn. O10 GARBED for 33 is best from an equity point of view but it ignores the blatant fish. My play plays excellent defense despite being back -7.3 in equity. I go with my play. It's 7th best in equity so not terrible in that regard at all.
>Lloyd_Mills: ALNRS 1K LARNS +27 305
#note Would Lloyd have bingoed? That's the 64 million dollar question. Couldn't afford to chance it.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEGINR J12 BING +30 320
#note Another nerve racking play! GIB, DIB, BIG, or this in the same spot? Quackle has this at -4.3 and 6th best but I think this is best. Two blanks are out and the potential for a game clinching 6 seems high. I turn over one more tile and go for the blanks. Besides, there's already a G at O10 that has potential for 6 letter words so this doesn't open anything new.
>Lloyd_Mills: DDEIU O10 .UIDED +30 335
#note GARBED is looking good about now!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEIOQR N13 ODE +20 340
#note Rack not recorded but almost certainly best.
>Lloyd_Mills: ?AQ 6F QuA +41 376
#note I can only hang on for so long if I draw SZ aand Lloyd gets 9 power tiles and the K. This play was huge.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EHIIORT M13 HOT +34 374
#note Best play! Time to make one last stand!
>Lloyd_Mills: ?EEEI 7D rEI +13 389
#note The blank was the last tile in the bag. Without it I cannot win. It may have been a completely different game is I find SANDWORT! This play is a winning play for Llloyd and best I feel.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIR 9C REI +9 383
#note 2nd best play for me! I miss H4 REAVOW for 13. If lloyd goes out next turn, it costs me 4 spread points. Still don't have any wins. Neither of us saw REAVOW.
>Lloyd_Mills: EE C8 E.E +3 392
#note Second best play! It's better for Lloyd not to go out here and play CAPE and RENO for 12. I can only score 2 the next turn so it's a spread of  positive 8 for Llloyd using that sequence. Going out with ERE nets positive 5 spread so -3 for Llloyd. Didn;t hurt for him to take the sure win as he thought his tracking may have been off.
>Lloyd_Mills:  (I) +2 394
#note Score recorded as 395-383. SANDWORT was my only major mistake and that may have been enough to cost me the game.
