#note Play DEFUSING at H5 for 65, my play, DEF in the same spot or FIDGE at 15D for 48 are all in a dead heat here. I imagine it's because there are still so many Es and Is, and in a large number of cases I'm going to draw something nice to play next turn as well. Now that I've gotten to reflect a bit I might have done FIDGE over my play instead, because that would leave bingos playing from SKA next turn if Carl decides to muddy up the other side of the board.

#note I'm a bit too focused on keeping a balanced leave here again. DENI is a beautiful overlap, I totally spaced out on the PEPSI hook

#note I feel pretty safe opening the board up with this. There's no vowel above or below the W he can play that will block me next turn, assuming I draw reasonably.

#note ENAMINE scores two more but gives away points unnecessarily if he has an H, so I go with this instead

#note He's fishing most likely, so I might as well balance my rack nicely and wait to pounce back.
