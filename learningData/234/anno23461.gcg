#note I thought WIVER 12A might have been Collins only so I passed on it, and I definitely disagree with the top simming suggestion of 2L WIVE. Completely unnecessary to play that dangerously, even if I am keeping an extra E as a result.
>Mark_Edelson: FGHI 8A FIGH. +48 235
#note Meanwhile, Mark is continuing to score well without bingoing, which is worrisome.
>Jesse_Matthews: ACEESTU 1L .ATU +21 260
#note The duck prefers a few fishing plays over my play. I saw both ECU D12 and FEU A4 (the two plays that sim higher than mine), but I was fearful of setting up an S hook for him in the case of the former play or giving away possible easy H points for him in the case of the latter play. I know it's a weird reverse form of gambler's fallacy to assume the worst, but after all the high scoring plays he has made I decided to play chickenshit and opt for points while balancing reasonably.

#note Quackle suggests SETUP in the same spot, but it's absolutely paramount that I hold onto the S here. As soon as I play mine off he can start to make setups to maximize the use of his S, assuming he has one. I can't take that chance.
>Mark_Edelson: ERY C12 .ERY +20 336
>Jesse_Matthews: EINNPSU B12 .PE +18 374
#note I was aware when I made this move that Quackle would hate it. This is very much a hyper-defensive move. The duck wants me to play I8 GNU. 
>Mark_Edelson: HI 9D I. +8 344
>Jesse_Matthews: DINNSTU 2N IN +10 384
#note The duck wants me to play NUN at F12, but after his one tile fish there's no way that's correct.
>Mark_Edelson: O 2A ..O +15 359
>Jesse_Matthews: CEHNRSU 15A CR. +30 414
#note The duck suggests CHIT 9B over my play, but I decided to play this and then play HIT 9C the next turn. I perhaps could've considered playing HIT first to keep the C as a blocking tile and then CRY if he continued to fish. With all those one point fishes though, my preference is to score and outrun.
>Mark_Edelson: ILO 6J .IOL +7 366
>Jesse_Matthews: EEHNSUU C8 .H. +21 435
#note Based on my draw, I can see that he's not going to be bingoing so I'll just continue scoring. The duck thinks I should play CAVERN/NU to try to draw into something like ENTHUSE as a bingo out, but since I have a tie I don't need to worry about amassing spread, I just need to win. GHI will do.
>Mark_Edelson: S H7 ..S +12 378
>Jesse_Matthews: EENSTUU G8 .EST +27 462
#note I'm still not sure what he was fishing for but whatever it was, he didn't get it. I'll again just take points here.
>Mark_Edelson: DLNOORT H11 ORLON +20 398
#note Mark has a really cool play here of CRYOTRON! 
>Jesse_Matthews: ENUU 4L .EN +9 471

#note Actual score 471-403 because he went over time.
