#note Quackle's preference is for GIF or GIP at 7F. Both leave three consonants and one vowel on the rack, and those include LR (not known for playing well together). Why??

>Jesse_Matthews: DEENQUY B5 QUE.N +20 140
#note I considered REDENY at H10 but passed on it; Quackle favours it. QU is certainly a nice leave after it, and now that I'm looking back on it I was influenced by her very clear fishing play and decided to block the easiest bingo lane, at least forcing her to have a bingo starting with S or O from PA if she were to bingo next turn.
>Sary_Karanofsky: ABM C12 BAM +20 168
>Jesse_Matthews: DEINRVY 11J IVY +20 160
#note I can safely peg her with an S and a decent leave after her last play, so keeping things balanced seems particularly important on my end. Only VERDIN at C1 sims as well as my play, but I opt against it in favour of balance.
>Sary_Karanofsky: DELOSV 15C SOLVED +41 209
>Jesse_Matthews: DEENRWX D3 DEX +30 190
#note I play this in order to save RESOLVED for next turn if I don't draw favourably. Both are the two highest options here.

>Jesse_Matthews: ?AOOTTT K3 TOOT +18 370
#note The duck prefers playing TOOT on the other side of WINNERS instead. I'm assuming it's because of available 9s that I'm not seeing as possible for her.
>Sary_Karanofsky: EGNOTU 1J TONGUE +35 351
#note I don't like TWINNERS at all, but after my losing streak the last thing I want to do is lose a game in a way that doesn't have to be lost (if I were to challenge and the word were valid). If I can just continue to outrun her I'm ok, so I leave it on the board.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?AILOST L3 STOA +23 393
#note I see that she has two outs but due to low time on my clock and not really caring about spread with my tie, I play anything that scores and keeps me ahead.
