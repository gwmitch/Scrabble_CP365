#note at this point i was out of ideas but i also noticed that john was very low on time. i figured i would make a play and hope he didn't have enough time for the endgame. quackle does like my play FWIW but it's probably not playing out the endgame correctly. maybe a standard play would be TINY or BINT. what do you do here?
