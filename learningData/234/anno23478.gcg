>Joshua_Sokol: AACEHIR -A +0 0
#note May 11th, 2016 @ the Montreal Club. I made this play for exploitative purposes. I was aware that it was technically wrong, but I favor this type of exchange when it's close, and this was bound to make Kenji overthink the position.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EFGNSTV -FGV +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEHIIR -I +0 0
#note following suit now, still technically better to exchange 2. Probably should have, to further throw Kenji off.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EHNOSST -H +0 0
#note Kenji did not care to find his bingo here, but he made a good play considering the circumstances.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEHIR H3 CHAIRED +84 84
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ENNOSST 3H .ONSENTS +72 72
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEJOR 2I JOE +27 111
#note Didn't think much outside the box here. I felt like scoring was nice, but that JE(E)R was too reckless and kept too poor of a leave, I thought AJ(E)E made sense, but not as much sense as JOE. AJ(E)E is probably better. I considered blocking the S too, that was actually the first thing I considered, but the only way to feasibly do that was to play JA(T)O or JO(T)A and throw my O away. Didn't want to do that.

#note G5 A(R)ENITES is one fewer but an alternative to this 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILNOR C7 LoONIER +83 295
#note scored as 82 :/. This move amazed my clubmates, but Kenji being Kenji didn't even notice that this was a full overlap.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ILZ 8L ZI.L +69 312
>Joshua_Sokol: BDFFNOP M10 BOFF +28 323
#note not sure this was my leave. Something similar. Wondered if I should play for 4 more at B12. Seemed to give back needlessly, but it's not the easiest hotspot to hit I guess.

>Kenji_Matsumoto: EGLY B11 GLEY +26 431
>Joshua_Sokol: GIKTVWY 12K WI.TY +36 457
#note this one was going to be close. KGV is a horrendous leave!
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DMOU 11I DUOM. +30 461
#note Kenji didn't see any gamble that seemed superior to this one. He was definitely an underdog after this play, but he had to hope I didn't have the X going forward.
>Joshua_Sokol: GKOTTUV 7M K. +22 479
#note Unfortunately I was completely sunk here barring an X draw, and even then
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EX 10I EX +53 514
>Joshua_Sokol: DGOTTUV A13 DOG +25 504
#note -9 to DOUG(H)T 4D. Did not like that word's chances.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEIIRW F10 WIRIE. +19 533
#note -1 to A8 WIRE, but -6 in reality

#note Kenji forgot about A(GLEY) for a turn. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto:  (TU) +4 548
#note 518-549 was recorded. Think this was my highest (at least live) total score.
