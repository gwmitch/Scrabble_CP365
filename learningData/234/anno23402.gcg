#note the best play here is the simple 7M MEW. i honestly thought WIGAN was better. i wanted to score, make stuff a bit more open and I did't like GIMNT or GINNT very much because the bag is still super consonant heavy. however quackle likes mew a lot more because of the much higher bingo %. gotta keep learning. -5.5

#note after ODE i really don't want to open the board. i don't know what's right here. i figured if i can survive a turn without her bingoing that I can probably do this. VIVE actually doesn't bump her bingo % all that much anyway because it does block the REM/etc lane a little. VISOR B10 sims best... i also considered N1 VIVA strongly but i'm not a fan. 1C AVO?   -2

>cesar: AIORRSW 1C ARROWS +43 375
#note leaving it open again. 3I WIRRA is the best play that doesn't leave that open. the risk is her bingoing from the T or something in row 14 -- ST something, which is not terribly unlikely, or even an A- bingo where I did ARROWS. so i think taking the points is right here, and quackle definitely likes it way more. i can, in many cases, win the endgame if she bingos as i'll have full bag knowledge.
