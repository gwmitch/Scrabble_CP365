#note I was so pleased to see this new word that I didn't properly look for my other options. BRAWNIER 2G for 92 is obviously better.

#note Were it not for that U, changing would have been a very likely next course of action. Interestingly M4 VICTIM sims higher than my play, probably because it doesn't offer quick points back with plays that hook an S onto QIVIUT.

#note Although I'm quite pleased to have found this fit, this was a bad time not to know a word. SCALADE at O2 or N9 score 20 points more. I knew SCALARE but didn't know SCALADE =(

#note I decided to try to fish for SAURIES, SUASIVE or AUXESIS, but I really don't need to be that desperate yet. JUS 3A is a better play.
>James_Leong: ADEOR A1 REDO.A +33 344
>Jesse_Matthews: AEILSSU 5J SU. +24 292
#note 11L SAU sims over my play. I really shouldn't be afraid of X plays after playing it, because there's already a spot for one that he's just created.

#note This would be a high candidate play...if we were playing Collins. Unfortunately I make a very costly dictionary error here.

#note Very costly.
