>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEEGIL 8D GALIlEE +68 68
#note A lot of bingos sim about the same. Quackle says mine is  -1.4 in  back of MILEAGE but I think it's a tossup.
>Carl_Davis: CDIOSSU K6 DISCOUS +78 78
>Carl_Davis: CDIOSSU --  -78 0
#note Carl says he should have played CUDS here. I can see why but SCUDO sims best apparently. This is a fairly convincing phony but I studied most of the DISC- words and this isn''t one of them.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIIIO -EIIIO +0 68
#note Best play! Carl gets another crack.
>Carl_Davis: CDIOSSU K5 CUDS +22 22
#note 7th best for Carl. -6.5 to SCUDO.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EINOTU E5 EqU.TION +78 146
#note Best play! And only 2x2.
>Carl_Davis: BIOOSWY -BIOOS +0 22
#note Exchange 5. Carl showed me and nearly had all vowels. YIKES!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGMNRRZ 10C GR.Z +34 180
#note Best play!
>Carl_Davis: HPT D3 PHT +18 40
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEIMNR I7 R.MAINED +66 246
#note Best play! INARMED doesn't fit. I saw REMAINED, forgot about it, and then remembered.
>Carl_Davis: QSU 4K SUQ +32 72
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEIKOV 12H K.AVE +34 280
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes BOVINE by 1 equity point but mine scores 6 more. I take mine.
>Carl_Davis: BFI 13L FIB +21 93
>Jonathan_Lindh: BILORTT 14M TOR +16 296
#note N10 BILBO is best equity play but I got paranoid and decided to play defense. -12.7 but mine maybe correct.
>Carl_Davis: ANO H12 .OAN +29 122
>Jonathan_Lindh: BILMORT C10 .LIB +14 310
#note I don't like any of the choices above this because they open too much. This is -5.9 but I do this again.
>Carl_Davis: EO 15N OE +17 139
>Jonathan_Lindh: IMORTVY 3B MO.Y +22 332
#note 3rd best play! Raise your hand if you saw IMPROV at 3B for 34! A little risky with 2 S's out but worth it I think. I considered 5M IVY which is the second best choice to Quackle but I thought it gave too much back and needlessly opened a 3x3. -14.4 to IMPROV!
>Carl_Davis: AFO D12 OAF +22 161
>Jonathan_Lindh: ILRTTVX 6J X. +25 357
#note 8th best play! TAX at 10H of course. -9.9 but this may have worked out better.
>Carl_Davis: GW G7 W.G +13 174
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILRTTV 10H T.V +14 371
#note Best play!
>Carl_Davis: EN 7K .EN +5 179
#note I had an unplayable bingo before this play but somehow I knew Carl would open. And he had to since he was behind.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEILRT N5 TRIALED +67 438
#note Best play! And only playable bingo.
>Carl_Davis: AEHT O8 HATE +43 222
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIPRSY 15A YIPS +38 476
#note Best play! When it rains it pours! I got a call around this time saying my cab arrived. It was 4:59 PM. Told the guy 5-10 more minutes and hung up quickly.
>Carl_Davis: ACELSUW B1 CU. +14 236
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEILRW 1B .LAW +10 486
#note Quackle's suggestions are off here as it wants me to go for a bingo when Carl almost certainly has an S. ECLAIR keeping EW is the play here although it isn't on Quackle's static top 10. Mine still allows bingos starting wih A. I just didn;t want a 3x3 by Carl, which is the only way he wins.
>Carl_Davis: AENNOOS 14H ..O +6 242
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIIJRR A11 JERR. +16 502
#note Best play!
>Carl_Davis: ADENNOS 2E ANODES +20 262

#note 2nd best play for me! F8 LEZ for 16! -3
>Carl_Davis: N 10M N.. +3 265
#note Was it this or TEN? I can't remember. Anyway best play for Carl.
>Carl_Davis:  (EI) +4 269
#note Score recorded as 515-267. CUDS was underscored by 2.
