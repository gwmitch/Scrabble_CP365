>Joshua_Sokol: AELMNOQ -LOQ +0 0
#note I should have kept AELMN here! Interesting position where I learned that a certain leave has more value than my intuition would think.
>Anna_Miransky: BFSUY 8D FUBSY +34 34
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEGMNT 9C GAM +17 17
#note This was a tough position! There are many moves to choose from, all of them similarly problematic in that they do not score well or retain especially good tiles. I think in a do-over I play 9C CAME.
>Anna_Miransky: AFOY B9 OFAY +25 59
>Joshua_Sokol: CENRTTU 12B .URT +14 31
#note Perhaps I should have played D8 (FA)CTURE here, but it seemed correct to try and prevent Anna from scoring as much as possible and retaining the best possible leave. Running into trouble here early.
>Anna_Miransky: EEEINTT G2 TEENIE.T +61 120
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDEENT 11E ENaCTED +90 121
#note well, it's still a game. This is probably better than ENTICED since it creates another big scoring spot to couple the one at H1. But I missed TENDENCY through her N! I saw TENDENCE but didn't think it valid. What a brain fart!
>Anna_Miransky: AILW 10J WAIL +31 151
>Joshua_Sokol: GIJLSUV 4C JUVI. +30 151
#note I didn't see E5 JUG(UM). Perhaps that is a better play. I prefer this, though. Maybe one up for safety.
>Anna_Miransky: ADQ F1 QAD. +23 174
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BGLOSV 12J BOG +24 175
#note Interesting choice between a few plays. I decided to take the points over VOG for 22 at 9I, since the V will be useful for bingo defense if I hit a bingo next turn.
>Anna_Miransky: ELX H1 LEX +44 218
#note perhaps why I should have played the other JUVIE.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ELNSTV N4 LEVaNTS +79 254
>Anna_Miransky: GMU 8L MU.G +30 248
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIKNOR O1 OKRA +30 284
#note This was tough. I ended up making the wrong decision here, fearing a bingo on Anna's part. I think I needed to swallow my fears and just play KA(B) for 37, since that also blocks a bingo lane. This just doesn't score enough or leave well enough, and opens me up to lose to being outscored. Keeping a second consonant makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, I should play (C)ROAK for 6 more, taking away a bothersome scoring spot that might sting later. Both H's are out and so is the Z. This is not a mistake I should ever be making.
>Anna_Miransky: OW E4 .OW +18 266
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIINN C1 NIN.A +24 308
#note this is what I was walking into playing OKRA. Now I have to keep 3 vowels with a pool full of duplicates. Losing my lead.
>Anna_Miransky: EHIN H11 .HINE +42 308
#note Too many!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIIO F11 .AOI +14 322
#note I am in hot water now! But I had such an amazing play here that just about everyone would miss. I should play it for the style, but it's definitely not correct. This is my play, but I need a good draw soon.
>Anna_Miransky: AIRR 1A RA.I +15 323
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEHIR 13C HE +22 344
#note I didn't take long enough to consider 14H (N)EEDIER. That's definnitely my play, digging for the Z and an S or two.

If anybody saw O(OGAM)E(T)E on my NAOI turn, I owe you an organic snack.
>Anna_Miransky: DOT 2B D.T +16 339
#note First she laid down TOD at M3, and took it back. I was salivating at the idea of getting a free turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEEIOR 14H .ICER +13 357
#note I was looking at DECOR(K) and simply missed REDOC(K)! No wonder I almost lost this game.
>Anna_Miransky: OOPPRRS M1 PRIOR +19 358
>Anna_Miransky: OOPPRRS --  -19 339
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEOOPZ B5 ZOO +25 382
#note I didn't realize that NICER set up (ADO)Z(E), otherwise I would have reconsidered. I still didn't notice it when I drew the Z myself, although it is probably wrong to play ZOO there as it gives GORP. This wins unless she has a bingo she missed last turn to the M.
>Anna_Miransky: ILOPRRS 5K POR.S +23 362
#note PROL(E)S is the best play here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEPS J2 PEDS +21 403
#note I wasn't 100% on DEEPS and running out of time. PESADE is a word.
>Anna_Miransky: ILR A7 LI +8 370
>Joshua_Sokol: AE 9G .EA +9 412
>Joshua_Sokol:  (R) +2 414
#note What a train wreck of a performance on my part!
