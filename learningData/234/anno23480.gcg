>Deen_Hergott: ?ILOOPS 8D PLOSIOn +72 72
#note Deen originally laid this down, took it back in hesitation, and played it again after visibly looking for something he was more sure of. That tactic ended up working incredibly well, as I too was unsure of PLOSION, and ended up challenging, thinking that PLOSIVE was good, but PLODE* not a verb, such as with EXPLODE and IMPLODE. Need to study!
>Joshua_Sokol: BGRSTUY -  +0 0
>Deen_Hergott: EILQVVW H7 Q. +11 83
#note Actual rack. Playing QI has great defensive merits, but they are shadowed by my ability to keep the board open, the spots still available, and Deen's horrendous leave. 9C QI for 25 seems like it's necessary, if not I7 V(O)WEL
>Joshua_Sokol: BGRSTUY F6 BU.Y +15 15
#note tough to close the board in one turn for Deen, but it's possible. I think this sacrifice is worth it for long-term board safety. Perhaps this is too paranoid.
>Deen_Hergott: EILVVW I6 VI.L +21 104
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGNRST -DG +0 15
#note Hmm, I might want to play 10B GENTS to set up another A after a play like VIOL, which takes an A. But this play is just too strong, I think.
>Deen_Hergott: AEEVW 10I AWEE +23 127
#note If what Deen said was correct about having a V here, he has to play WEAVE over this. The defense of AWEE is weak.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENNRSTW L9 N.WT +14 29
#note I went full idiot here and forgot that VIOLA also takes an S. AWEE made me think that Deen was playing super defensively and that VIOLA was VOILA and didn't pluralize. I should probably play WEN or NEW here for 12, but there is still value in prying the board open even further...
>Deen_Hergott: ADEZ E8 .AZED +35 162
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGNRS 12A GRAN.EES +76 105
#note Do I preserve the PLOSIONS hook for later, since it will be difficult to block without an S? Or do I leave the rest of the board open and start working on the top? I think playing ENRAGES now sets Deen up for time trouble, but other than that it seems weaker. 
>Deen_Hergott: AFF A12 .AFF +33 195
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINOU 14A .OINED +28 133
#note Disastrous miss of B10 OU(R)IE
>Deen_Hergott: ?EILMSV M3 MiSLIVE +79 274
#note Extremely disastrous it was
>Joshua_Sokol: DKNOORU 4H KOURO. +28 161
#note Trying to make something happen on the top in a few turns. Probably hopeless, should play something like ROOK or NOOK L1 instead
>Deen_Hergott: ACERT 15E REACT +26 300
>Joshua_Sokol: EHJNOTU H1 JOU. +45 206
#note there is still hope!
>Deen_Hergott: HR I2 RH. +21 321
#note :(
>Joshua_Sokol: EHINTTU B9 THI. +15 221
#note 5J HEI(S)T would set up a case S I probably need and score. I think that's the play, but I missed it.
>Deen_Hergott: BI A8 BI +14 335
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENNTU 6I .ENU.E +13 234
#note Whoa, this game was a train wreck! Did I seriously miss UNEATEN?!

#note I can maybe win if Deen misses a 9 that I draw into through OR.
>Deen_Hergott: AX 15K AX +36 416
#note nah, I needed the X and nothing was available.
