>Will_Scott: EHIKNO 8D HONKIE +34 34
#note That's racist! Lol!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAIPSYY 9C YAY +23 23
#note Best play!
>Will_Scott: NPSU J8 SPUN +22 56
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILOPS 11E OPALI.ES +90 113
#note Best play!
>Will_Scott: EMNO H11 .EMON +24 80
#note It was around this point I noticed that Will was grabbing for the bag without RECORDING HIS SCORE, then tracking, and then recording his score. That is an actual rules violation. Not some eye rolling and raising my hand for 3 seconds without obscuring Will's vision of the board.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CFINRW 14F FR.WN +21 134
#note 2nd best play! This or FROW in the same spot. Quackle likes FROW by 2.2 equity, I say it's a toss up. Will continued to grab for the bag without recording his score for several consecutive turns at least. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones if you know what I mean. People get called out for doing that.
>Will_Scott: DOR 12K DOR +15 95
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CHIORS N9 OStRICH +81 215
#note 4th best play! ORCHISES and CHRORINES play at 12 B for 86 and 83 respectively. Wasn't looking there. CHRISOM scores the same on this line but may give less snapback. I spent a long time trying to place the C or H on the triple letter. No such word exists that fits. -5 to ORCHISES but I like covering this lane with CHRISOM or OSTRICH best.
>Will_Scott: TT 10I T.T +9 104
#note He can't even use the lane! Still using shady recording technique.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEEIOU O6 EIDE +17 232
#note I think this was my rack. Quackle says -.6 to exchanging all but DE but this is clearly best from a position standpoint. 2nd best to Quackle but best in reality.
>Will_Scott: INX 12C NIX +29 133
#note He's still doing it!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEEOQU F4 QUEE. +16 248
#note Oops! First major mistake of the game. Right word wrong spot. Queen at 15D is 31 and doesn't open the board. 7th best play and -15.
>Will_Scott: FIR N4 RIF +27 160
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEEOUV 10B VEE +25 273
#note 2nd best play! Do not see the beautiful OEUVRE for 20. It may have prevented his bingo too. Mine is 2nd best and highest scoring but -11.2.
>Will_Scott: NOW 4L WO.N +16 176
#note Incognito lane opened.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIOORU 4D RO.UE +30 303
#note Best play! Closes the board further. I like.
>Will_Scott: ATV I2 VAT +22 198
#note Will stopped the shady recording technique around here. Was he doing it in our last game as well?
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGGIOU 13C UDO +25 328
#note 4th best play! There were a few better plays here. DOGGIE at 15A for 38, GIGHE at 15K for 33 and VOGUED at 2I for 26. I would have played VOGUED if I knew Will's rack but this still isn't bad. -14.5
>Will_Scott: EGILRST K1 GRISTLE +74 272
#note VOGUED would have been ideal for me a turn ago. Best play for Will and good play by him to create this incognito opening.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEGGIM E3 C.MA +26 354
#note There's GIGHE again but I wanted to block the E bingo lane. I also MAC and CROQUET with these same letters for 32. OOPS. -14.3
>Will_Scott: AA 15M A.A +18 290
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEGGII 15A BIGGIE +41 395
#note Best play! No playable bingo exists.
>Will_Scott: AADLTTZ O1 AZA. +39 329
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DJLT M7 TaJ +36 431
#note Best play but I scored as 35. Oops!
>Will_Scott: ABLT 14A AB +20 349
#note 2nd best play for Will. He misses BLAT and THAE at 7A for the out.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DL 12G D.L +10 441
#note Best play along with DOL M3!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (LT) +4 445
#note I liked the way I played this game! No really crushing equity losses although I had some moderate slips. After my public shaming of Will Scott's behavior during our games on Cross Tables, I consider whatever beef between him and I to be over so it's done with. Still, remember the cardinal rule. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
