#note The duck prefers ZEP at M7 (which I saw and passed on) due to the points. My rack is going to be bad either way, so I probably should have just done that.
>Adam_Logan: HM 7H HM +27 45
>Jesse_Matthews: BDJPTVZ -BJPTV +0 19
#note In many other cases I wouldn't keep DZ, but my chances of drawing an E to play an easy ZED at 6F next turn are quite high.
>Adam_Logan: DGR M6 DR.G +9 54
>Jesse_Matthews: DEEIPUZ 6F ZED +44 63
#note I'm so fixed on using the option that I set up for myself after the exchange that I don't even look for better options. 10E DUPE is 15 less points, yes, but the leave is infinitely better.

#note It would have been very helpful to have known BUPPIE here =(

#note FIVE at J11 is preferred, but I don't like how dangerous it is with two blanks, four Rs and four esses unseen.
>Adam_Logan: ??AENSX 15E uNSEXuA. +89 200
#note I don't think I've ever seen two blanks both used as Us before!
>Jesse_Matthews: BEFIIIV -BFIIIV +0 100
#note The duck prefers J11 FIB or an exchange of all 7. With all those Es out there, I totally get why I should change 7 if I do change. I'm definitely in favour of an exchange here regardless.

#note FLEW is more volatile but I need that when I'm down by this much, and then hope to draw an S

#note I'm really proud of myself for finding this play. Even though it's not likely to work, I saw the chance of drawing OS to give myself NIVEOUS or ENVIOUS on my next turn.

Quackle has found another option that does something similar: 14 LUV. If I draw SS to EEGIN then I'd have AGENESIS from 2E. and if I draw OS to EEGIN then I'd have GENOISE at 9O. The chances of him not having the C or V are extremely low though, so I suspect he'd block that much more easily than he'd block my setup attempt at NIVEOUS/ENVIOUS. Neither are likely to work, but I actually like mine better!

#note Turns out it didn't matter, because Adam left the extremely unpleasant II for me in the bag.
