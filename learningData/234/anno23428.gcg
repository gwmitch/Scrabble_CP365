>Quackle: CEMNOTW 8D COWMEN +32 32
>Mack: ABDHMPR E3 RHABD.M +30 30
#note 7E DAMP is another good option, but often gives back high scoring plays at F6, and leaves a less balanced leave then RHABDOM.
>Quackle: CFGRTTU 9H FUG +16 48
>Mack: ELNOPUV 10A OVULE +32 62
#note Many options here, including this, UNROVE and UPHOVE. I don't mind the volatility of this play since I'm opening up two big hotspots - column A and the RHABDOMES hook.
>Quackle: CIRTTWX 4A CRWT. +32 80
>Mack: AEGNOPS 11C POS +50 112
#note PASEO and POSE are fine too, but I preferred keeping the most balanced leave possible given the small difference in scores. 
>Quackle: AAILNTX H5 ANT..IXAL +70 150
#note !
>Mack: AEGILNS A7 GAS.LINE +80 192
#note I'm just as likely to get an S as Quackle since we both just bingoed and will have random racks, and if I bingo elsewhere I leave column A open for him, so as scary as this looks, I feel it is correct.
>Quackle: DEEEINR 3E .EINDEER +62 212
>Mack: ADEEGOR 2J DRAGEE +35 227
#note 2F OGEED is another good option I missed and is a bit safer than this. This play does have the advantage of turning over an extra tile for the all-important S, though.

>Mack: EEIPTTY 1G PYE +47 427
#note Not thrilled about emptying the bag, but this play still leaves me a reasonable shot given the drek unseen.
>Quackle: AIIIILU I11 ILIA +19 451
>Mack: EIOQSTT 10K .OTE +6 433
#note The only winning play, as far as I can tell - E13 QIS loses to his sequence of N1 REIKI followed by G7 UM, and there are no other effective set-up plays.
