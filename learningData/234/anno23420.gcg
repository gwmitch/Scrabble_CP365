>Sal_Piro: ARUW 8G WAUR +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDDRTU J7 D.UB +13 13
#note I played off a D, B and a vowel on turn one in both of my games against Sal this tournament. I don't know why I opted for this over BU(R)D. I guess I thought it would have been easier to overlap. This gives back a bit more, and seems like a slight mistake, although I was going for spread at this point as well as the win.
>Sal_Piro: ?ADEITW 11D DAWTIEs +77 91
#note Sal missed the beautiful vIEWDAT(A) at H1 here for 18 more points.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDORRT 12A ACTOR +24 37
#note I considered ACTOR and H10 R(I)TARD here. ACTOR seemed better than RITARD, since it left a better leave and didn't seem that dangerous. Both of the biggest scoring spots on the board would be safe-ish triple word scores, and I'm opening another spot for my DR leave below my play. After a lot of looking for better plays, I didn't take enough time to look at shorter plays, as CRT, CART and CARTO are strong leaves. 12C ROD seems worth the points sacrifice for a better leave and less giveaway.
>Sal_Piro: FGIOU K3 FUGIO +21 112
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEGORR 4H GRO.nDER +74 111
#note Here I looked for another long while for a better play than my original thought of ROGERED. For some reason I doubted GRODIER, but I also saw pROGR(A)DE at A7, the only bingo hitting the triple, and firstly wondered if it was valid (PROTRADE being valid), and secondly did not know if it had any hooks. I therefore opted out of it. This is another mistake that I shan't make.
>Sal_Piro: ABKS B10 BA.KS +38 150
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIILOY A7 HIYA +34 145
#note To make matters worse I decide against playing HAIRILY and HOARILY for no good reason. They both appeared good to me but I second-guessed myself. Mistakes every turn add up, this one being the worst thus far.
>Sal_Piro: INZ H1 ZIN. +42 192
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGHILO 13B .EGEL +32 177
#note Now I have to phony to keep up with Sal's pace. I thought this was most likely valid, but Sal did not. He let it go because he recognized KEGELER, which is valid.

#note A good draw sends me to the driver's seat on a scary ride on an open board.

#note Do I counter-fish with Q(I) at 14G or at 2G? 

I thought I should keep on the scoring pressure, but a fish is looking quite strong now that I am analyzing this game. I hit a lot of stuff, and when I don't and he does (which is pretty unlikely), I can still hit stuff later on. What do you think? He seems slightly vowel heavy, and therefore I didn't worry too much about vowel trouble here.

>Sal_Piro: EJU 1A JU.E +42 371
>Joshua_Sokol: AEOTTVX D3 OX +38 400
#note I was running into a bit of time trouble here due to my earlier puzzles, but I had enough time to calculate things here and look for better plays than this. I saw that AX instead of OX didn't allow for as many overlaps, but I thought VOTTE could catch me with a difficult endgame position over VATTE. I didn't consider EX, which seems to be slightly better than AX, and didn't consider emptying the bag with AXE long enough to realize its merits. But I missed the definite best play here! I6 EA(U)X for 42 empties the bag, scores as well as AXE, sets up a spot for my V in VOT(E) and most of all blocks most of Sal's possible bingos. It's totally unlike me to screw up such a position and it angers me that it ended up costing me the victory.
>Sal_Piro: ADEELOR E3 RELOAD +27 398
#note My play also allows Sal to make a one-tile fish with two spots to bingo. Ugh.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIITTV K9 TITI +36 436
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIITTV --  -36 400
#note The S was the last tile in the bag, which means I had a very good shot at STATIVE, but instead drew a crushing II. Tough loss that I definitely deserved.
