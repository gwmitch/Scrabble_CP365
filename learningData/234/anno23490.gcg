>deen: DIINPRS 8G DIP +12 12
#note DRIP gets the slightest of nods ahead, about a 10th of a percentage. Shedding the extra consonant makes sense, but R is a nice tile.
>chuck_a: BGO 7H BOG +16 16
>deen: EIKNRST K7 STINKER +79 91
#note Drew EKT to INRS
>chuck_a: AJTU 13I JU.AT +40 56
>deen: AIMNOPS 14J PSION +52 143
#note A nice post-bingo draw, but no 7s, bingoes to CLRT, but T in wrong spot (CAMPIONS, LAMPIONS, RAMPIONS, TAMPIONS/PTOMAINS/MAINTOPS). Played 14J PSION* for 51 (should be 52) and was rather shocked to later learn it was phony. PSIONIC, however, is valid. The play was held, but stayed on. L11 AM(A) for 24 wins the sim, just ahead of plays on Row 14, which are clearly more dangerous.
>chuck_a: GLOV 9E VLOG +19 75
>deen: ACHLMRW 15M MAW +31 174
#note A five consonant draw, but at least I can score with the rack. MAW for 31. Opponent replied with a very nice double-double, THRIVED, for 56.
>chuck_a: DEHIRT E5 THRI.ED +56 131
>deen: CGHLNRU 8A LUNG. +24 198
#note Another single vowel rack. My play, 8A LUNG(I) for 24 simmed 2nd best, behind the higher scoring 8K (T)HURL on the TWS directly opposite. (Looks like I missed THRAW and THARM there last turnll, tho I think MAW may have been strategically sound as an alternative, removing a big scoring hotspot).
>chuck_a: EFZ D10 FEZ +38 169
>deen: CHMNORR 8K .HORN +36 234
#note Where are the vowels? Now I did take the opportunity for a TH-word. 8K (T)HORN for 36, but missed a better -HORN word, a bingo in CR(U)MHORN! Not a word I knew, but this would have been glorious :-) Maybe next time, in 2055. Apparently a crumhorn is a double reed woodwind instrument (photo included). Quackle is so humbling...and it's not done with me yet.
>chuck_a: DOR 11H DOR. +9 178
>deen: CEEMNRW 7M WE +20 254
#note Woohoo, two vowels! I see CREWMEN immediately but it's an orphan bingo. I could play the word with six of my tiles, however, at C2 to the open N, for 30 points. That would have been a good play. An even better one: M4 NEWC(O)MER! We won't dwell on my play - move along folks, nothing to see here...
>chuck_a: LOO 15H LOO +14 192
>deen: CEEMNRU F4 REM +26 280
#note Well I didn't miss a bingo this turn, CERUMEN doesn't play. My play, F4 REM for 26, makes the top ten, but CREME in the same spot is better. Meanwhile my opponent plays off his 4th O in three turns - it feels like I'm getting the better of the tiles, but things can change quickly. Score 280-207.
>chuck_a: AOV D3 OVA +15 207
>deen: CCEEINU 14F CUE +13 293
#note No bingoes here - a small play, 14F CUE for 13, getting rid of some duplicates. Opp responds with FRENU(L)AE* for 62, which I put on hold. FRENULUM and FRENULA are good. Unsure of the -E hook, though it logically seems doubtful. I've been burnt before tho, and let it stand. Turns out FUNEREA(L), for 86 and a tie game, to the TWS was legit, so although I should have challenged, I did manage to avoid a bullet here. Chuck mentioned that he saw the TWS bingo shortly after pressing his clock.
>chuck_a: AEEFNRU A3 FRENU.AE +62 269
>deen: CEEIIIN B10 NIECE +22 315
#note Remember earlier when I couldn't get any vowels? Welcome to Scrabble! Quackle agrees with B10 NIECE for 22, despite the II leave.
>chuck_a: AB A14 BA +16 285
>deen: DEIIIQX E2 QI +13 328
#note E2 QI for 13, luckily this is available. Otherwise a nasty reminder of the late Q last game, and an exchange would probably be necessary. The board is shutting down, but row 4 is still very possible for an eight starting with R, and some smaller possibilities on columns N and O. 
>chuck_a: AT 6I TA +14 299
>deen: ?DEIILX F1 XI +24 352
#note The blank gives me some room to breathe, but there is still another out there. And only 7 tiles in the bag. Opp's last play, 6I TA, for only 14, looks like a possible bingo fish, setting up SL-, ST-, AL-, AT. It's not over yet. I need to ditch the X, so F1 XI for 24 looks sensible. Quackle points out N2 InDEX(ER) for 60! But prefers keeping the blank. Thoughts on this anyone? 
>chuck_a: IS 1F .IS +30 329
#note Pretty fortunate there was no bingo played here.
>deen: ?DEILTY 6M TYE +34 386
#note Now this looks like a bingo rack. Meanwhile, the unseen tile pool on opp's last turn: AAAEISSTY? and amazingly he did not play a bingo along row 4 or 5! He may have had the Y (turns out not), or been missing the blank - I may have survived one in any case - 1F (X)YLoID, for 48, for example, but it would have been close! Opponent played 1F XIS for 30. Score after this: 352-329, what to do here? (Unseen tiles AAAESTY?) I played 6M TYE for 34, blocking row 5 and columns N and O as much as possible, while scoring (turns out to be the 2nd best play). Seems to deal with everything but an eight from the R on row 4. And with three A's out, I was fairly confident.
>chuck_a: ?AAAEST 5I ASEA +18 347
#note TYE blocked AnATASE at 5I
>deen: ?DILY 4K DaILY +29 415
>deen:  (?AT) +4 419
#note A good fight, and with late blanks, nothing was certain until the very end, even if I did have momentum working for me. Some cool misses for both of us. CRUMHORN would have been magnificent, and NEWCOMER should have been possible for me on a better day. And even a bingo on Rack 13, though it wasn't a needed one.
(I'll let readers ponder that one) These are the type of plays Adam Logan or Matthew Tunnicliffe are unlikely to miss very often (IMO), and a big part of why they are such great players, and so hard to beat! 
Back to a 2-2 record, but still a long way to go!
