>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEFHIT 8H FITCHEE +88 88
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes the 8H FITCHEE by 2.3 though I'm not sure why. I like to make Liz think this may take an S! She knew it didn't. Fine enough play.
>Liz_Gottlin: EGNTY K8 .YGNET +24 24
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAIKNNO 7H OKA +30 118
#note 2nd best play! 13I KATION? Cool. It's 3 better than mine. -3.
>Liz_Gottlin: ALUW 6J WAUL +29 53
#note KATION doesn't give these cheap points back.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AINNSTU L11 UN +10 128
#note Best play!
>Liz_Gottlin: BIINRTU 10D BRUITIN. +65 118
#note Best play for Liz! Good find!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABIINST D10 .IB +14 142
#note Best play!
>Liz_Gottlin: EGIJNPY -EGIJ +0 118
#note Liz exchanged.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEINPST E4 PAINTE.S +94 236
#note Best play! Also note the disconnected 9 ANTISLEEP!
>Liz_Gottlin: ENOOPUY D4 OY +23 141
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEJORX 13C REDOX +50 286
#note Best play! I am on this game!
>Liz_Gottlin: AENR 12F NEAR +16 157
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEJMORZ N7 J.EZ +40 326
#note Best play! Next turn I get a bad break and a good break on the same turn!
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AEGRSV O9 RaVAGES +95 252
#note Tied for best play along with SAVAGER. SAVAGER would have been best given what I had but Liz is behind and needs as much volatility as possible to come back.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ADEMOR 15H MADROnE. +83 409
#note 3rd best play! Oops! EARLDOMS at 15H for 86. Also the hard to find cOMRADE at C2 plays for 85 so I did have a bingo is Liz did SAVAGER. I don't know if I find COMRADE though. -3.
>Liz_Gottlin: ELOW 8A OWLE. +27 279
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEIPUV B6 VA. +17 426
#note 14th best play! 13M VUG is the equity play for sure but I didn't want any fluke hail maries with 2 S's out. Mine is only -5.7 behind on equity and guarantees the win so I'll take mine.
>Liz_Gottlin: HO 14E OH +30 309
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIOPSU 15A COUPE +40 466
#note Best play!
>Liz_Gottlin: AQT F2 QAT +37 346
>Jonathan_Lindh: FILNOSS G1 FINS +28 494
#note 2nd best play! FILS in the same spot for 28 as well. -.7
>Liz_Gottlin: EGIILMR 1G .ILMIER +39 385
#note Best play for Liz! I think this was her rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDLOST 5H DOST +21 515
#note 2nd best play! F6 DOS for 26! This is -3 but still a good play.
>Liz_Gottlin: GI M12 GI +10 395
#note Tied for best play! Nothing scores above 10 here. IGG and GIG at 13M score 10 as well.
>Liz_Gottlin:  (ADL) +8 403
#note Possibly my finest played game of the tourney. No siginificant mistakes in this one.
