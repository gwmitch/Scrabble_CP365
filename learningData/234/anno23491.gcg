>Craig_Rowland: FIPU 8H PFUI +18 18
>Jackson_Smylie: AFKNNSU 9K FUNK +17 17
#note didn't know FUNKIA, that looks good. I was a bit wary about the hooks cause he could have an S or Y in his range, but I think it's fine.

>Craig_Rowland: AEILORV 11G VARIOLE +73 105
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEGLST 10H DAG +21 92
#note I considered ADAGE and DAG, after quickly ruling out AGLET and AG and G(I) and stuff. ADAGE works better with my leave, but I'd also much rather Craig on a closed board than an open one - the N5 spot isn't ideal but DAG fits better with the style I'm going for. 
>Craig_Rowland: EH N5 EH +31 136
>Jackson_Smylie: AEGLSTZ 12H GET +20 112
#note DAG? LEZ? DAZE? I like that get gives me an S hook, and ALSZ has a bit of potential with that spot even though the Z isn't especially good here. ALSZ could also hit sulphones, which you will realize I did not see. 
>Craig_Rowland: CDIO F11 ODIC +24 160
>Jackson_Smylie: ALRSUVZ 10B VARUS +28 140
#note SULPHONES seems best here, although varus isn't terrible. the Z bomb there stays open occasionally. 
>Craig_Rowland: EI D10 .EI +6 166
#note spent a long time here
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EELMWZ C12 MEW +20 160
#note this is a silly play against his range, which is quite S heavy (he definitely was close to a bingo). On this closed board, I don't want to give up 30 points like that, and the placement of the L isn't gonna give me a huge Z bomb or anything. I think just playing WIZ is better here. 
>Craig_Rowland: ESTW 15A WEST +33 199
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EILRYZ C9 Z. +21 181
#note seems to bingo quite a lot

>Craig_Rowland: NTU 13L .UNT +12 221
>Jackson_Smylie: ?DILNRY O13 .RY +18 225
#note thought about stuff like DRY or IDLY and then TRY. I think a blank is quite high in his range at this point, and I don't like the position much if I open a lane at the top and then he played for 24 through bunt opening a second lane. TRY keeps things more complicated and closed. also, DILN? works fairly well with the Y there. 
>Craig_Rowland: RTY M3 TRY +21 242
>Jackson_Smylie: ?DILNOR 15L ONL. +8 233
#note I see DIAPHONES as a good way to get the lead here. I didn't see RO(E) here, which I kind of like now. DILN? also works better with the TR in TRY for bingoes, although it plays off one less tile. 
>Craig_Rowland: AG 4K GA. +8 250
>Jackson_Smylie: ?BCDIRS 13E R.B +8 241
#note I could play DIAPHONE now, but I think it's better to save my blank cause it's not likely that it's going away. I considered mainly just DIB and RIB/RIBS. I saw CRImS(ONLY)* which I could play in a crunch, but prefer to continue towards the diaphones possibility. I feel like just playing DIAPHONES may not be enough to win the game, and my S could prove more useful later, especially if craig bingoes, so I prefer RIB to RIBS. that being said, I want more chances at the A. 
>Craig_Rowland: AM B13 MA. +24 274
>Jackson_Smylie: ?CDEIRS H6 CE. +7 248
#note If Craig bingoes at 7a that's not bad for me. My hope is that I play DIAPHONES and then we either trade bingoes or neither of us bingoes. having just one lane makes it a bit riskier, especially if I have to sacrifice a lot to close it.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?DENRST 1H STRaNDE. +80 373
#note 8 in the bag, and Craig does not have the Q or X. Also almost certainly has the ?. So my chances of drawing QX are 7/8, which just does not bode well for me, especially cause I can only assume he's holding well. I am low on time here, and so is he (maybe 4 mins apiece or something). He definitely didn't have a bingo last turn so stuff like EILNT? is not in his range, but vowelly stuff like AEILN? definitely is in his range, which will now bingo a lot. If he bingoes I think I'm screwed. 

The one saving grace of playing STRANDED is that the pool doesn't actually work very well with the board - if not the blank, it has to be the T hooking OE, and it's hard to underlap stranded. I basically took my chances that he could bingo, and then the off chance I leave the Q in the bag (I think x in the bag loses if he bingoes cause of N1 bomb). Q thinks that craig bingoes about 44% even if I specify EILNO?.
