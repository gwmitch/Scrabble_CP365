#note A two vowel pickup from an exchange of two was not ideal, so here we go again...

#note I briefly thought about passing to force him to play or otherwise pass for a sixth time and end the game, but after his exchanges of four and two it was entirely possible that he also had a blank. Given that I had a tie, the last thing I wanted to do was tie again and make my spread matter again so I decided to play the game and play any of my bajillion bingos. What do you think is the best bingo to play here?

#note Such a vexing draw after bingoing. If I had even one vowel I would've made a play to block up the bottom area and make 8s difficult. Instead I have to change here...

#note ...and of course he has a bingo @#$%@#!%!
>Jesse_Matthews: ACEISTY H1 YETI +36 274
#note The duck likes JAY over my play because I have the case ess. Easily blockable setup though, so I'll take my play.
>Zev_Kaufman: IKNN H11 K.NIN +27 261
>Jesse_Matthews: ACGMNST 3L .AG +22 296
#note This turn I decide to do the setup thing, which is more dangerous than JAY was becuase this takes a G, not just an S. CAM at m5 scores only a few less, clears off another consonant and opens a new lane as well. If he bingos using it, the TWS line will likely be open for me to use in return.

#note Another bingo...unreal.
>Jesse_Matthews: CCMNSTZ -  +0 296
#note Given this awful rack and given how dire things could be for Zev if he doesn't bingo on this turn, I decide to challenge. No dice.
>Zev_Kaufman: AUU 15G U.AU +4 347
>Jesse_Matthews: CCMNSTZ -CCMNZ +0 296
#note The duck prefers playing through with something like C1 CENT, but I want a fresh shot at bingoing on Lane O.

#note I'm super low on time here after trying to find ways on the last few turns to fish for bingos, so I just make a play that looks like it balances. WILD at 9C is better.
