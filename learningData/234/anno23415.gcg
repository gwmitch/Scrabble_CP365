>Joshua_Sokol: ?CENOOU 10D UNCO +16 40
#note I have had trouble in the past seeing the word OUNCE, and this time it was very costly. I also doubted the validity of UNCO(Y), which is definitely better here as well.

#note A simulation actually prefers D6 CLOQ(U)E here, setting up a dangerous scoring spot. The Q is pretty bad here, even though I can draw into some stuff next turn. I don't know if I agree with CLOQ(U)E, but getting rid of the Q was very high on my priority list this turn. Jason didn't end up drawing an S, which out of 72 unseen tiles, seems to occur around 30% of the time, I think.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EJOQRR I3 JO. +22 84
#note Out of all the horrendous options here, I believe this one was the best of the lot. Missing OUNCE and not getting rid of my Q afterwards has definitely snowballed on me.
>Jason_Li: AABENRS 7F AN.BEARS +65 201
#note Ouch
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EMQRRT 8A MER. +24 108
#note Opening the bottom with (A)RMER or (A)RMET makes sense in the short term, but long term, I'm going to like to be able to keep the left side open as well. I also have a shot at (A)QUAE this way.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIQRTZ 4L ZIT +46 154
#note This sucks, as he is extremely likely to have an I (I would reckon around 80% of the time if not more), and so I would be bailing him out of most racks, but at least if he doesn't have an I, I might successfully set up my Q. Otherwise my main focus was opening the right side as much as I could, scoring and keeping a leave, again with the Q, and hoping for the best. I can hit a lot of killing bingos next turn, so all is not lost.
>Jason_Li: AILR O1 LARI +29 270
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFQRVW J4 W.F. +27 181
#note Not as bad of a draw as it seems. I can draw into QUIVER words pretty often here.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEQRTV 6B Q. +31 212
#note It seemed like opening a triple-triple would never work here with EVERT under WAKEN, since Jason would block the the T 99.9% of the time, leaving me with little way to win the game. At least in this case I can draw into ER(G)ATIVE if he decides to leave the G open. A few months ago I would play EVERT, but Jason and my game keep on developing to a point where there is no way he isn't blocking the T.
>Jason_Li: GGIMNU 1A MU.GING +42 384
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEPRTV N2 PE.ER +28 240
#note I guess there was no way he wasn't blocking the G either, but I thought some of the time I could just hit 2 more bingos and eke it out.
>Jason_Li: ADEEHSU 12H HADES +46 430

#note fishing for (M)OTIVATE, although I can hit a few other things too under KAT.
