>Joshua_Sokol: AABRV H4 BRAVA +26 26
>Jesse_Matthews: EEHIOVW 5B HOWEVE. +32 32
#note Had a hard time choosing between this and WHOEVER, but ultimately decided on this. Both are the top candidates but WHOEVER sims just slightly above. Is it really worth it to force them to have a big consonant to score in that spot rather than them needing an A or O plus bigger consonants to score there?
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIPTT -AEE +0 26
>Jesse_Matthews: AAEIJOS 4C JO +37 69
#note It was this or SOJA at 4A. I didn't think playing the S was worth 9 more points but apparently the duck does! Maybe because the only vowels available to play through on the board are As and Es, plus I'm leaving doubled As on my rack?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEOTTU 9H sTOUTED +69 95
#note I look at this funny, but given the bajillions of other bingo options, double challenge, and my uncertainty, I leave it.
>Jesse_Matthews: AACEGIS 6A CAGE +33 102
#note The duck prefers just playing AGE and keeping the C. It seems unnecessarily dangerous with all the Ps and Rs (plus another C and a W) still in the pool.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFY 8M FEY +35 130
>Jesse_Matthews: AIIIRSS A6 .IS +15 117
#note This rack plus this board position is quite unusual. Only CRISIS in the same spot sims ahead of my play - I'll guess it's due to clearing away most of my Is and scoring decently. Seems bad to give up my esses for so little but this may be a position that actually calls for it
>Joshua_Sokol: DILNTU N2 INDULT.. +24 154
#note I've never seen this word before (I have seen INDULTS though) but I still don't hold. Seemed silly to play a phony for 24 at this stage of the game, but I should've trusted my gut and challenged.
>Jesse_Matthews: AIIRSTX 10I AX +52 169
#note It seems very odd that a cheap X play for 52 doesn't sim highest here, but due to all of the Is still in the pool that's exactly the case. XI M2 sims highest, due in part to the nice leave and to getting rid of an i with all of the Is left to draw.
