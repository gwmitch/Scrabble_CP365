>Mark_Schmidt: APRW 8E WARP +18 18
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIRSTY F8 .Y +5 5
#note This was a horrible miss to start off the tournament! ASPERITY! I know that word. 8th best play to Q but if I can't find the bingo I like keeping SATIRE together so I think this is the 2nd best play. -25.6
>Mark_Schmidt: GHO 7D HOG +19 37
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEIRST C1 BAITERS +79 84
#note Best play!
>Mark_Schmidt: ?AAINRS 10B ARtISAN +70 107
#note Not bad from Mark but he missed some better bingos that scored 80 including PARTISAN, PIRANHAS, BARTISAN, BARGAINS, and ABRASION. Also note the front hooks onto ARTISAN. -10
>Jonathan_Lindh: AILMNOU 1A UM.O +27 111
#note Probably should have done UMBONAL. B2 LOUMA for 34 at B2 is apparently best here and I'm not sure I even know the word. -2.2 and 4th best play.
>Mark_Schmidt: ADEEINN 11H ADENINE +68 175
#note Very nice bingo from Mark!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADIKLNX N10 K.LIX +52 163
#note PHONY! OOF! Spot XENIAL for 58 in the same spot. This phony ended up being 2nd best and -2.5. Not even a hold.
>Mark_Schmidt: EHIRTV 12D THRIVE +45 220
#note Another really good play from Mark.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDINRY J10 C.DARY +34 197
#note No clue what to do here. 2B YAIRD for 42 seems to be the clear favorite. Mine was 10th and -11.1.
>Mark_Schmidt: EEIMNRS I2 ERMINES +71 291
#note Maybe YAIRD wasn't such a good idea after all. CEDARY is just fine.
>Jonathan_Lindh: INOOQUZ H1 ZOO +40 237
#note 3rd best play! Right letters wrong spot. OOZY for 48 at 15G is the best. -8.
>Mark_Schmidt: JO 15H JO. +39 330
#note In all fairness, Mark had JO and OE for at least 29 depending on his other letters so he was going to be scoring well regardless.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GINOPQV 4A VO.ING +28 265
#note Missed the P hook onto ARTISAN for GIPON keeping QV. VOTING is 2nd best and -2.2 but there maybe some advantage to keeping this line open. If I see the PARTSIAN/BARTISAN line that is.
>Mark_Schmidt: FGU O13 FUG +35 365
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFIOPQU L8 EQU.P +34 299
#note I miss PARTISAN again. A6 EQUIP is 57. Mine is 8th best. -26.5
>Mark_Schmidt: ALTU A4 .AULT +24 389
#note I don't give Mark this with the PARTISAN EQUIP either.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AFILOT M2 FOLIAnT +70 369
#note PHONY! I need to play FLOKATI for 95 and not this junk. FOXTAIL and INFLATOR were the other bingos that played.
>Mark_Schmidt: ACEENST K2 CETANES +71 460
#note Mark let my phony go so he could play his bingo. Very nice.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDELOTW N1 WED +27 396
#note I ran out of time and had to throw something down. My clock was under 15 seconds here. I whiff on the ARTISAN front hooks again and miss BOWLED for 57. Bad miss here. -43.1
>Mark_Schmidt: DEEI 13A EIDE +12 472
#note In all fairness, BOWLED gives this word at B12 for 26 so Mark is going out anyways, but BOWLED was still an awful miss.
>Mark_Schmidt:  (BLOT) +12 484
#note Score recorded as 486-395.
