>David_Gibson: BHOT 8G BOTH +18 18
#note You're reading this correctly. I am playing David Gibson, best Scrabble player in all of America. If I lose, I only lose about 1 rating point. Let's give this a whirl!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEQRS -AEQ +0 0
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes QAT but I like the bingo friendly leave. Quackle says -9 but I go with mine. I don't want the board getting cramped up against Gibson.
>David_Gibson: AE 9G AE +10 28
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIJRSU J8 .AJI +30 30
#note Best play! Debated leaving the I off. This is best. Also JEHU J6. Come to think of it, JEHU might be a little better.
>David_Gibson: EE 10J .EE +10 38
#note David either has vowel overload or he is fishing. I recall him saying something after the game about too many vowels. That explains this play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIRSTTU I1 RUTTIES. +60 90
#note Best play! Would you fish off UT at 10F or play the bingo like I did. It's really tempting to pass on the bingo but I decided I wanted an open board against David. I like my choice and so does Quackle.
>David_Gibson: EX H1 EX +42 80
#note Keep this play in mind for later in the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDINRW M10 DRAW +28 118
#note So close to INDRAWN! So close. This is listed at 5th best. Once again, do you leave a letter (the N in thie case) off or on. Quackle likes it better on. Once again, I want the volatility against Gibson so I take it off. -5 to K9 WED but I do again.
>David_Gibson: GIY 12L Y.GI +18 98
#note David is opening a lot this game which seemed unusual. He was probably getting very ugly letters.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADILNRR O11 L.ARD +18 136
#note Another hard turn. Quackle likes 14K RANID or DINAR for 21 best. Mine is tied for 6th best and only -1.2 back. I am fine with my play and it succedes in closing off the hanging I.
>David_Gibson: ESTY K7 TYE.S +35 133
#note Oh yes! Or oh no! This was a great play by one of the greatest in the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIINPRZ 6F ZIN. +33 169
#note 2nd best play! This was one of the plays that cost me the game. I missed 14J ZEIN which is much better because it scores 9 more and doesn't take the A front hook. I could sense for some reason Gibson had an A. I don;t know...I just could. ZEIN it is. This was a trivial mistake from an equity perspective but boy did this cost me. -3.5
>David_Gibson: AEGINTU E2 UNITAGE +80 213
#note Best play for David! David still has UNITAGE at L1 for 70 instead of 80 if I do ZEIN, but those few points would make all the difference.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEFIPR D8 FIBER +37 206
#note Best play along with FIBRE! Which one would you choose? Both blanks are out so FIBRE would be a little more volatile because of FIBRED!
>David_Gibson: AO F5 A.O +17 230
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEOPP D3 APE +23 229
#note Best play surprisingly!
>David_Gibson: DEIMNOV 1F OV..MINED +66 296
#note David took a really long time on this play and served up this dagger. Who would even look for a bingo with that rack? This is the only 9 with these letters. There are no 7's and no 8's. Incredible find. I give online props to the master.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOPQV 9C Q. +21 250
#note Best play! it's this or C11 PAVE but I don't like NOQ as my leave.
>David_Gibson: OOW C11 WOO +19 315
>Jonathan_Lindh: AENOPTV B10 PANTO +37 287
#note Best play! David said after the game he really liked this play. I felt good about being complimented by the master.
>David_Gibson: IL A14 LI +8 323
#note David was likely scared I acquired one of the two blanks still out after this turn. I did but couldn't do anything in that spot.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CEGOOV C1 VOG +22 309
#note Another hard turn! This 2nd best to 2B VOGUE for 33 according to Quackle. I think this is better due to the pool. Very few vowels left. I'm also holding one of the 2 E's so a 30 point play the next turn is reasonable if I can't bingo the next turn. I like my play and I think it's better than Quackle's. Remember, I can still outrun David without a bingo if he doesn't bingo! Q says -9.5 but I disagree. Mine is better.
>David_Gibson: KNU 14L KNU. +25 348
#note I don't think David has the other blank yet. Another smart defensive play as DRAW or the D at O15 are dangerous.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CCEILO 1A CO.E +30 339
#note Best play! No playable bingos! This opens another lane and is sure to make make David sweat. This is why VOG is better than VOGUE given the pool.
>David_Gibson: AMR A1 .RAM +11 359
#note This blocked COUNCILS for me and cuts volatility on the A10 spot. Smart move again. Now I throw away an entire game worth of stellar play on one play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CILNSU 15G NUCLeI +31 370
#note 3 missed bingos! None of them wins with what was in the bag. My play was actually the play given the F in the bag as it blocks David's bingo at F9. If I play CUTLINES at 4G or DULCIANS at N1, I lose by more than 1 because David bingos out and catches me with an F. If I bingo with SCULPIN which I thought would win, David bingos out with HANDLERS! I somehow came up with the best play given what was left in the bag by complete accident!
>David_Gibson: ?DEHLRS 4I .RaSHED +24 383
#note Yep David had HERALDS, HIRSLED, HOLDERS, and HURDLES if I don't do NUCLEI. David also missed the best play DALEDHS for 38. Glad to know even David Gibson misses some. This play was -14 for David. He would probably find DALEDHS if he had more time. NUCLEI wins for sure I believe with E, H, or ? left in the bag. It's a sure loser (but closest) with an H and other letters left in the bag require near perfect play on David's part. CUTLINES and DULCIANS win all the time except if there is an F or D left in the bag (HERSELF). SCULPIN wins unless there is an F or H left in the bag (FONDLERS, and HANDLERS). There is no winning play with the F left in the bag unless David really screws up. Very challenging endgame here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: FS K3 F.S +10 380
#note Best play! There were no wins sadly. It's this or FETAS and SI for 10 as well. This is among the best games I ever played in my life. Seeing HANDLERS on Quackle made me feel better about this game. A one point loss was the closest I could get to David Gibson.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (L) +2 382
#note David finished the tournament at 16-0 (15-0 and one bye). I held him to his lowest score and I was the closest person to beating him. I originally won 382-380 but we recounted and David picked up 1 on CRAM (originally scored as 10) and 2 on TRaSHED (originally scored as 22 instead of 24. Hard breaking loss but I feel like I played like a 2000-ish playerthis game. Why can't I play like this more often? David was very gracious and a complete gentleman! I hope to play him again someday and he said that he hopes to play me again someday.
