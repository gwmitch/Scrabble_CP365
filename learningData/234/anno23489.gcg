>Andrew_Golding: AEX I6 AXE +43 43
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEHITT 9G BIDET +44 92
#note It was an interesting choice here between many 40+point options. It ended up boiling down to J3 TITHE, J6 DEBIT and my play, 9G BIDET. BIDET scored the most out of the 3, but seems to give more back, such as allowing overlaps on column J, which are easier to hit than (JEHAD)I overlaps. TITHE also blocks undelapping plays at G5-G7, as well as giving back some 7s ending in A or E, and finally setting up _AXED plays. So BIDET was definitely aggressive. I think I just wanted to play JEHADI :). TH is slightly better than BD in general, but TITHE creates a possible use for my D in creating (AX)E_. TITHE is correct here.
>Andrew_Golding: CEIU 4H .UICE +28 71
>Joshua_Sokol: CGHILMT J3 L.CH +34 126
#note Was unsure of MILCH here. 10J MILCH is significantly better than LICH
>Andrew_Golding: AANP 10D NAPA +16 87
#note This time, I blocked an underlap at G5 (NAP), and force Andrew to open the board and score very little. Now it gets a bit ridiculous, so brace yourselves.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGIMRT 11E MIGRATE +108 234
#note Yup, that happened
>Andrew_Golding: ADIOV 8K AVOID +41 128
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIKOTU 7N OE +7 241
#note Time to ruin my lead with fancy but stupid plays. Do not score 7 and block two lanes while setting up your K for maybe 34 points. It's not worth it. I missed 12D KUE and forgot about EMIGRATE for one turn, tunnelling on the spot Andrew had just opened. My lead is too large for me to worry about an immediate bingo on Andrew's part. It's not like those are the only lanes in the world.
>Andrew_Golding: AFRSW L11 SWARF +41 169
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKNQTU 15L .INK +33 274
#note It seems correct now to sacrifice a few points to keep the very strong QUET and prevent triple-triples. But perhaps 13I QUE(A)N is the play here.
>Andrew_Golding: IRWY M2 WIRY +35 204
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEQTUZ 13I EQU.TE +32 306
#note two insanely good draws put me in smooth sailing mode again.
>Andrew_Golding: EGNS N1 GENS +38 242
#note but Andrew continues to bedazzle me with 40-point plays! With two blanks out!
>Joshua_Sokol: DEOSTTZ D8 ZO.ED +62 368
#note Oh, yes, the reason I played equate was to have as many chances as possible (5) to draw an O for either ZONED or ZONER or ZONES here.
>Andrew_Golding: GINO 8A GIN.O +45 287
>Joshua_Sokol: LNRSTTT M7 T.LT +10 378
#note Unfortunately at this stage I misremember GONZO/GINZO. I thought GINZO took an S and GONZO did not, but alas, GINZO only takes ES. And now I am slightly in trouble!
>Andrew_Golding: ILNRRSU A1 SLURRIN. +80 367
#note This bingo would have scared the living hell out of me, if I hadn't gotten yet another ridiculous draw! In this position you WANT your opponent to have either one or both blanks, so as to reduce their chances of hitting another bingo later on!
>Joshua_Sokol: AAENRST 1A .ANTERAS +77 455
#note yup... AAE to NRTS
>Andrew_Golding: O 1N .O +9 376
#note During Andrew's turn I was really focused on whether or not I could outrun a bingo here. I was calculating what would happen if Andrew played OE at O1 for 21. It looked like it was going to be scathingly close. Lucky for me, he opted to only play one tile, leaving it easier for me to outrun his bingo. I think he said he drew the other blank here! 
>Joshua_Sokol: BFIMOOV 5D MOVI. +20 475
#note I calculated and recalculated, and it looked like I could only lose to a freak bingo that tripled the P or the Y at B8 starting in I, and I was fairly certain that wasn't going to happen. Even if it did, I would have no way to block it without opening myself up to losing another way. I played this instead of the actual best play, L1 MOV(E), again because I thought GINZOS* was valid, and that a bingo at F1 starting in R and ending in S would be too much for me to withstand. Nothing plays there, but if there was something like ROULOPES*, I would lose. So I opted to protect myself from one disaster scenario out of 2, giving away 2 spread points in the process, as MOV(E) L1 scores 4 more and uses one fewer tile, leaving me with 2 more points on my rack to give to Andrew in the endgame.
>Andrew_Golding: ??LOPUY C11 rOPY +31 407
#note In reality, I escaped disaster number 2! There is an available 8-letter word starting in I that plays if I draw the other O that would beat me. I cannot afford to block it, so playing MOVI(E) or FIV(E) is best for spread purposes if Andrew does not hit a bingo or see one. MOV(E) at L1 is worse because it leaves me with less to do in endgames that Andrew does not bingo out in.

It's definitely tough to see a bingo in the current circumstances. I don't think Andrew knew either of the two bingos here, PYLORUS and POLYPUS. I saw PYLORUS and I don't think I knew POLYPUS. 

It's great that Andrew managed to find R(EMIGRATES) under so much pressure. He tells me he saw it after ZONED.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEFO 4C FOB +28 503
#note So, what was Andrew's 12.5% chance of winning in my pre-endgame position? I gave many clues, and it's a word we all know...
>Andrew_Golding: ?LU O11 LUd +18 425
#note I somehow missed (I)mPUrELY! If I had seen it I might have broken a sweat!
>Andrew_Golding:  (E) +2 427
