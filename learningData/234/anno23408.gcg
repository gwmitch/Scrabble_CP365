#note Context: I have a 40 point spread over Joey going into this final game.  I can lose this game by 19 points and still win the tournament.  The entire game is played under that assumption.  FIB looks better here - normally you'd want to rid yourself of the W as fast a possible but WHES leave has some synergy.

#note But unfortunately for Joey, as is usually the case whenever we play, I hit something in an unlikely spot.

#note I spend a while here looking for a better alternative.  EMuLSO(I)D was what I needed to find.

#note This is the critical position. There are no good ways to shed my W and score a lot.  3L WOS scores 28 but it's easy for Joey to score just as much next turn from the W; and I lose my case S.  This move on the other hand creates a difficult position for Joey.  Blocking this setup won't score much and will often give me back a decent scoring play.  Quackle likes this play a lot - even without taking into account my 19 point cushion.
