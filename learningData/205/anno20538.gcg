#note come on vowels! I'd rather hold onto the S and ake some setup at 11O later

>Matt_Canik: MNRSTXY N1 ST.RMY +38 276
#note X is really strong on this board, so I'll keep it. Also two blanks out - want more turnover. 
>Leslie_Millard: GUV 4C GUV +28 327
>Matt_Canik: AENRUWX O5 EAUX +42 318
#note A bit counterintuitive, but the ratio is 12V : 11C: 2B. I also want to turn over the extra tile for blanks and score a little more. 
>Leslie_Millard: CDIO N8 ODIC +18 345
>Matt_Canik: ?AENRUW 10J WU. +15 333
#note I hate making an equity-style play like this on a closed board but I really don't want double Us with my W. I'm also down to about 3 minutes here- gotta go fast!
>Leslie_Millard: RT D8 T...R +12 357
>Matt_Canik: ?AEINRU I11 AI. +14 347
#note Really distracted by endgame scenarios where I can play (HEP)ARIN and surprise her to go out and win, then just got super low and did this. I really don't know why I played this, especially when I can play the same tiles for 7 more with VISA. Man I suck
>Leslie_Millard: IO O1 OI +14 371
>Matt_Canik: ?EINPRU K10 .P +16 363
#note Low on time, throw this down?
>Leslie_Millard: ACNR G2 CARN +15 386
#note I hold this even though I'm mostly sure it's good... I can't find any winning plays, but I am also so convinced it's good...
>Matt_Canik: ?EGINRU 13A GNUs +13 376
#note Can't find anything, I have to hope she misses BE(G)oT/BE(G)eT. Ran out of time and couldn't think of anything. 

Unfortunately, since I held her play for so long, Leslie forgot to draw her last tile. The rules show that I am NOT obligated to say anything here, and someone told me they remember hearing that I was actually encouraged NOT to say anything here, so I watched as Leslie played "out"...

>Matt_Canik: EIR A7 REI +16 392
#note ...So the other directors in the room are called, make an adjudication for me (I'm not comfortable making calls in my own game, especially when I know the call is going in my favor), and they rule in my favor. Leslie has to take the extra tile and I win. 

I have never felt worse about winning a game, and I think if I had to do it over again I would say something, even if the rules advise against it. I'd rather lose and feel honest and win and feel like I had cheated, even when I did what the rules say to a T. 

Leslie was a really good sport about it - thanks Leslie! - and it sucks that this happened against such a nice opponent.
