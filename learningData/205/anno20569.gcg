#note 5E DeFEAT(I)S(t) for 86 is flashy...DEFAu(L)TS for 94 here.
>Joey_Krafchick: AILOORU 15H ALOU. +18 147
#note O(D)OUR sims better, but given the situation I should play ALOU(D) to keep row 14 wide open for a bingo. I'm down 83 after this turn.

>Jackson_Smylie: ADFNRTU 3G F.U +26 305
#note FR(A)UD is probably the smartest play here. FUD is the cliche equity play but FR(A)UD knocks out so many things AND leaves ANT with many E's out.
>Joey_Krafchick: IOOOQRU 8M .OO +15 263
>Jackson_Smylie: ADDNNRT D2 .NNARD +14 319
#note INNARD*. INNARDS is a sticky S word....I completely blundered it during the game. 

D(I)NT is the play here with 7 E's out. D(I)NT bingoes 41% of the time next turn. (-13.2)
>Joey_Krafchick: IIOQRTU A1 O.IT +21 284
#note OI wins a sim. I think QU(A)I, which is second, is the correct play. Despite keeping QU for next turn, on this board it actually isn't all that. (-2.8)
>Jackson_Smylie: DDEGITY 13F DYED +24 343
#note (L)EDGY is the play with 6 E's out. DIT + E is likely turning over 4 tiles. DI(SH)Y is very very close. (-2.7)
>Joey_Krafchick: CIMNQRU 5C M.QUI +32 316
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGILTY 9B GEY +16 359
#note GY(R)I is the play. (-3.7)
>Joey_Krafchick: CGNNORS B6 GON. +10 326
#note Vowel heavy pool, I like my play. He probably left one, but not two E's when he played GEY. 

My play bingoes 47% of the time next turn, far ahed of any play. (YA)NG wins the Many plies but I'm defending mine. I say that the extra tile turned over by GON(G) is more valuable than keeping the last O to burn one less tile.
>Jackson_Smylie: AAEEILT N7 T.EA +14 373
#note Championship Player says this is fine. It likes (V)EAl also, but despite the nice points you have to block SOMETHING, so TOEA is correct. With the unseen pool, a high scoring 80+ bingo from the P at 1H is unlikely, so VEAL isn't a bad option.
>Joey_Krafchick: CEGNPRS O4 PRES.NG +26 352
#note SHEN is in TWL3, whoops! I saw no possible bingoes so I played this just for spread.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEILMU 6D .IM +32 405
#note 14A MEALIE wins by one more point. (-1)
>Joey_Krafchick: CE 7A C.E. +8 360
#note I6 C(AR)E(T) is 5 more. (-5). 

I should have challenged (I)NNARD, end of story. It blocked my QI for 44 AND QUI(T)TOR for 54 that turn, so that would have been a HUGE swing but it didn't even occur to me. Good game
