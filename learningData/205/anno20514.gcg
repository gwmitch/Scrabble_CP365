#note Thought about NOUNAL!
Didn't think I should do it... but it's simming #1. Sad.

It is  not lost on me that I took more points for leave last turn and this turn I traded, which diminishes the value of those points last turn. Though had I been willing to go for NOUNAL (or any of the other plays), it would be slightly different.
