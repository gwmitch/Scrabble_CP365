#note I held for a while, unsure of the pluralizations of STASIMON. I think it's MORE than 50% to take the S (it doesn't). But I have the blank, I have some lines - I can probably still win the game if I just don't challenge and hit my bingo.

#note Man I just don't know. I need a *big* bingo at this point (or maybe just a big 7 from the P with the Q, like PIQUANT. I think the Q will be condusive to that. I missed KLUDG(E)/WIVED, which is awesome.

#note I need big points *and* a bingo at this point. I can play QU(E)A(N) now, hold LTU? and try to bingo next turn, but I will probably *still* be behind. I need to set up the Q, bomb it, and *then* try to catch up. Lots of tiles (DDDGGIIY) to add to the score. Maybe I should just play QUEAN and take my chances.

#note Fishing for (A)LTITUDE. If I play (A)L, Judy can smash the board down again with like AKIN/ALA or something. Judy needs the O to properly address the 5 row.

#note (AM)BULATED is there - I didn't see it - but I have to make this play anyway. AT over UT for sure, because Judy *must* have the R to do anything about this spot, and even then she will always give back some sort of line for me to try and bingo out.

#note Judy makes a nice blocking play and thwarts my plan! Well played, Judy!
