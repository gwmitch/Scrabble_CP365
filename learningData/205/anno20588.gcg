>Jackson_Smylie: AABEGGV 8G GAVAGE +24 24
#note playing at 8H or 8D sim better, taking the points seems fine, I don't lose much board control.

#note I prefer playing the lower volatility CORDATE here, I don't need to fish.

>Teresa_Schaeffer: IY 7E YI. +17 176
>Jackson_Smylie: DFLNORS 4J F.N +21 193
#note I was worried about her bingoing, but (U)NFOLD opens up the board a lot more, which is what I need. DLORS is not something I need right now. I was worried about giving the S hook.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: ?EGIJNT C4 JEtTING +75 251
>Jackson_Smylie: DLNORST 8A SL.D +21 214
#note I stand by my play, even though Quackle will kill me. the S at 8A will give me a great line, and it's really tough to close the lane without scoring 8 points. NORT is more balanced than NRST, and there are still 3 S's out. The board isn't too good for S's anyways.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: APSW O7 SWAP +34 285
>Jackson_Smylie: MNOORTU K10 MUTON +21 235
#note I liked giving myself a few extra lanes with MOUNT, and hopefully I draw an S. Q likes MOURN, since there are 3 R's left and only 1 T. UNMOOR seems a bit reckless. MUON or DUOMO looks good, to keep a better leave. I need to bingo.

#note I pretty much gave up here and was just hoping I'd draw something nice.
