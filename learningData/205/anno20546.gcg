>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINRV H4 VEINED +28 28
#note This game was really tough on my end. Really tough. Prepare.
>Adam_Townsend: AAEIOOQ -QIOOAA +0 0
#note I think this was his leave. Something very similar to this if not. Adam didn't think it made any sense to play through this and play QI for 26, but Sam and Dan thought he should and I said it was debatable. Where do you stand?
>Joshua_Sokol: AEORSSW G6 SOW +17 45
#note I normally don't telegraph a second S, but it seemed well worth it to keep a more flexible leave here. RASES is only good for bingos and AERS can at least draw into 30-point plays at times. Also, this was defensive.
>Adam_Townsend: EFU F7 FEU +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAERRS -AAR +0 45
#note I couldn't justify playing (V)ARA here because I wasn't 100% on it taking an S. And even so, no need to make such a bold play at this point in the game. I also couldn't stomach the idea of keeping two R's, for the same reason (but much more negatively amplified) as I preferred not to keep AERSS last turn. I think this is the correct play, but certainly not the ideal one. 
>Adam_Townsend: ADLN 10C LAND +21 39
>Joshua_Sokol: AAELRST 11C ALA +14 59
#note As you can imagine, I spent forever before finally playing something. I almost convinced myself that ALASTER* was valid, but then I remembered ALASTOR. I looked and I looked and I looked and it seemed nothing played. I unfortunately didn't have or take the time to write down AAELLRT, since I probably would have seen LATERAL. Really tough to miss LATERALS here. I liked the long-term defense of this play, and didn't mind breaking up my rack to make it, because I was tired of looking for bingos! Not sure Adam saw/knew ALAND or ELAND, but we'll see. In hindsight, besides playing the bingo, I should just play A(LAND).
>Adam_Townsend: ?ABCGIR 12E BRACInG +69 108
#note Adam saw the other placement. He didn't explain why he didn't play it there.
>Joshua_Sokol: EENRSTU L6 NEUTERS +90 149
#note This is probably the worst bingo to play for 90, but I had no time to waste looking at the little things. TUREENS is the one I missed.
>Adam_Townsend: HIP H12 .HIP +33 141
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHIIMU 15D GUIM.E +13 162
#note Maybe I eat two I's and play 13B HUGE? I prefer this, it also might bait a challenge.
>Adam_Townsend: NNTY 8K T.NNY +24 165
>Joshua_Sokol: ADHILOT D4 HALOID.. +26 188
>Joshua_Sokol: ADHILOT --  -26 162
#note I really had a terrible case of tunnel vision here, with a lot of time already wasted. I wasn't sure of HALIDON* and I was pretty convinced this was valid, but I didn't look elsewhere. I had no idea what to do strategically either. This was a bad blunder.
>Adam_Townsend: ABCOPRT 6J CA.TO +15 180
#note and a good challenge by Adam. Although now he was faced with a very difficult turn. He first laid down 14E BA(I)R*, then switched the B to a P, then agonized for many more minutes. It was quite difficult to make a play knowing what I had, but he unfortunately managed to give me perfect knowledge of his own rack by constantly switching plays over the board. The right play is B6 CAROB, unless he wants to block my best play, in which case 11I BOA(R)T or K10 BO(G)ART work.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADHILOT 11I HOA.D +30 192
#note Now I could finally breathe, since I was in serious time trouble before Adam spent so long last turn.
>Adam_Townsend: BPQR F14 Q. +31 211
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLRTV O1 TILLER +29 221
#note Still, I am not in a good position
>Adam_Townsend: ABPR K4 AP.R. +16 227
>Joshua_Sokol: EFISVXY L2 FIX +44 265
#note I knew that VEX, FIX and F(LA)XY were all close, but I didn't have time to think about much of anything. It looks like VEX is a bit better.
>Adam_Townsend: BEE N2 BEE +22 249
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EESVWY 10J WY. +37 302
#note What a draw. 
>Adam_Townsend: OTT D7 TOT.. +6 255
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEMSUV B8 VEE +16 318
#note Wow. Bingo miss number 2. hUMVEES plays! I have never played that or had it played against me, which explains me missing it. Still, unacceptable. Spread will definitely matter this tournament.
>Adam_Townsend: IK 2J KI. +20 275
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AMOSSU N11 SUMO +22 340
>Adam_Townsend: JO M14 JO +18 293
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAOOSZ C5 ZOA +16 356
#note I hadn't tracked correctly, so I had to play it safe...
>Adam_Townsend: EGIINRR 5C .ING +28 321
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADOS 13A rOADS +16 372
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EIRR) +8 380
#note -10 since I went over. Ultimately I just blew a ton of spread this game.
