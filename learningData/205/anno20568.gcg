#note CLAW is worth considering, since OWLET opens lanes for his likely bingo-prone rack, but I like taking the points.

#note I wanted to score points and play more tiles rather than fewer this turn, to get through this rack and to increase my chances at the ?. I hated keeping BU but nothing is great. My other consideration, UNV(E)IL, sims well. Closing the 8s lanes seems like a good idea right now.

>Jackson_Smylie: BEEPTUZ 14F ZE. +32 272
#note I saw OUTFRAMED* was a possibility for 58, and thought that keeping TU was okay for that. ZE(E) also keeps UPBEAT if I draw an A. That being said, I missed ZEBU M3 for 40, obviously better.

>David_Engelhardt: ?CJOSUV 9A JO. +18 305
>Jackson_Smylie: CEIKPTX N2 KEP +26 317
#note I messed up, thinking KEP held both an I and an X play for next turn (if David doesn't play there). PE does not in fact take the X. KEP still sims well, because David only hits the O column with an A. I think it sims too well, because in the sim it won't have Dave using the ? to play there, but I think he would probably burn the blank for a 30-40 point play.

KEP also makes the S spot for SKEP, which David may or may not know (I believe he did). EXP(O) sims well on Quackle (4-ply), but I don't see how CIKT works well with that spot, I think David benefits from it a lot more. That being said KEP is dangerous. I'm liking EXP(O)
