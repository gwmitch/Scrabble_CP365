>Matt_Canik: AAENRST H7 SANTERA +66 66
#note Which placement? I think this one - bingos with the S are the most common so I want to leave that out of a DWS line. Right?
>Joey_Krafchick: IMOPRRT 11B IMPORT.R +74 74
>Matt_Canik: ?AGIORW 9B ARrOWI.G +65 131
#note AIRGLOW also. This does what I want to the board's shape. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEHISS 10B HIE +37 111
#note HAE seems better?
>Matt_Canik: ?EGISTT 14C EGoTIST +67 198
#note Thought about STaGIE(S)T which OBLITERATES the board, except SANTERAS. But I'd rather just knock that out now. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEFSSW 12D SWEA. +35 146
>Matt_Canik: DDEIINU 7C INDUE. +9 207
#note Probably too defensive by me, but I really just wanted to kill the board now. Worried about the X setup, but SWEAR came down in like one second so I don't think it's likely he has it. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AAEFNSX 6E AX +53 199
#note dicks
>Matt_Canik: AACDIJU 15A CUD +21 228
#note Would rather knock this spot out now and hold (T)AJ for next turn
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEFNSZ 13A FEZ +56 255
#note Wow
>Matt_Canik: AAEEEIJ 10H .AJ +30 258
#note Ouch AEEEI leave!
>Joey_Krafchick: AELNRSY A6 YARN +33 288
>Matt_Canik: AEEEIOR B2 AERIE +21 279
>Joey_Krafchick: DEEILNS 4B .EDLINES +70 358
>Matt_Canik: EFGKOOO -FGKOOO +0 279
#note Um.... 

-GKOOO instead to try and hit FAERIE maybe? Naw I don't think that spot stays open long. I think I have to exchange, there's nowhere to play these tiles. 
>Joey_Krafchick: BDIM H1 IMB.D +30 388
>Matt_Canik: ACEINPQ F3 Q. +11 290
#note I didn't want to play QAI(D) here because there were so few vowels left, plus I've a 6/23 draw into APNOEIC.

>Joey_Krafchick: OOOTTUV D1 OUT.O +7 395
#note Exchange 7? OUTDO? I prefer OUTDO, Joey did too
>Matt_Canik: ACEINPT A1 CAP +27 317
#note If I fish for APNOEIC again, I think Joey will either outrun, block, or both. Gotta score. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EFOOOV I1 FOE. +22 417
>Matt_Canik: EHILNTU 6A ..H +14 331
#note Plan: Fish for outline/outlive in the K row and 15 row if joey really messes this up somehow?
>Joey_Krafchick: OY 15I OY +7 424
#note Joey can't remember this rack
>Matt_Canik: EILNTUV 2H ..N +7 338
#note I need a miracle
>Joey_Krafchick: BGLLNOV G11 ..B.N +17 441
#note Held and released after some maths. TABIN*

Joey didn't realize there was a tile (the K) in the bag. 
>Matt_Canik: EILOTUV K2 OUTLIVE +76 414
>Matt_Canik:  (GKLLOV) +28 442
