#note 12K SILVA or 12L VISTAL for 32pts is the best play, but I'm not sure POLICINGS and  I don't want to take unnecessary risk
>Rastra_Teguh: ELL 7E ELL +12 207
#note LURD*, I don't know if this word is good or not but it's only 12pts and I have T and S for TELL and SELL so I decided not to challenge		
>Alexander_Gozali: AIORSTT 15C .OTARIST +77 383
#note NOTARY in Bahasa Indonesia is NOTARIS* (a person who has the authority to act as an official witness when legal documents are signed), so I think it's makes sense to try NOTARIST* because -IST suffix means follower or profession, luckily Rastra didn't challenge it
>Rastra_Teguh: AGINRSY D2 SYRINGA +79 286
>Rastra_Teguh: AGINRSY --  -79 207
#note GELL*, SYRINGA is good		
>Alexander_Gozali: BEHKNNT 14F BET +25 408
#note can play KEB, KET or HET for better points on same places, but decided to play BET because I want to make TI instead of BI to make sure the 13 line is closed off, and I decided to play BET instead of KET/HET because I think it's easier to make a word end with K/H instead of B (making KELL/HELL/BELL on 7D), turns out I made a major mistake this turn		
>Rastra_Teguh: AGINRSY N1 AY +22 229
#note Rastra overlooked SIGNARY/YELL, and me too actually, I shoulda block that spot last turn, all is well I guess

N2 YAR/YE/GAN/POORI for 33, 10L GINNY for 37, and N2 YA for 24 is better play than this (along with SIGNARY/YELL ofc) 	
>Alexander_Gozali: AHIKNRW D4 WHARK +44 452
#note WHARK* and RELL*, I'm pretty sure at least one is valid, turns out none is, escaped hell once again because Rastra didn't challenge
