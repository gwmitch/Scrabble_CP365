>Matthew_Larocque: CEIILNS H8 LINIC +20 20
#note This is phony, I played it thinking it was valid. Should I just play LI instead? Or CEILI.
>Chris_Williams: FIK I7 KIF +30 30
#note I don't think Chris left it on purpose because it's certainly better for him to challenge it off.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEFGRS 11G F.DGE +20 40
#note Missed two 2x2 plays here although I wouldn't have been very sure on SERIFED. I liked keeping the strong ERS while opening an S hook.
>Chris_Williams: AMW 12K MAW +20 50
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIORS M11 O.E +12 52
#note Not the optimal draw, and this forces me to make a dinky play. Fishing off two tiles is risky though because I can easily draw two more vowels. The worst kind of rack is a rack that doesn't bingo and doesn't score either. Not the kind of rack I'd want on an open board against a higher rated player. But I have to think 12 points keeping EEIRS is about as good as 0 points keeping ERS.
>Chris_Williams: ABJ J6 JAB +39 89
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEILRS 6J .EE +10 62
#note Except the two-tile draw left me too vowel heavy to bingo, again. Lol (LIB)ELEES.
>Chris_Williams: NORUV L1 UNROV. +20 109
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILORS 2H ALIE.ORS +70 132
#note This could end badly especially if he has the Z. But I have to hope I caught him at a bad time.
>Chris_Williams: DGOP H1 P.GOD +30 139
#note Sort of, I definitely expected that to be worse.
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEPTT 5B ADAPTE. +22 154
#note I didn't take too much time here, trying to save time and get some turnover, but this probably gives back too much for a 22 point play. I didn't know (S)PATTED, unfortunately.
>Chris_Williams: OTW 6B WOT +32 171
>Matthew_Larocque: ACESTTU 4B CUT +28 182
#note I did not know SCUTATE, but ACUTEST should have been findable.
>Chris_Williams: AHY O1 A.HY +42 213
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRST N9 ANESTRI +81 263
#note I liked how this blocked the easier places to bingo, but S(WOT) is near impossible to block without an S, so I could be in trouble if I don't get another one.
>Chris_Williams: GMNOU O6 MUNGO +29 242
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIRTV 15L VA.R +33 296
#note TRIV(I)A keeps the board more open, which I don't want.
>Chris_Williams: ADO 6F ODA +23 265
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEEIT -EEEI +0 296
#note Go away vowels.
>Chris_Williams: BINS M6 SNIB +30 295
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEHLTU 7F EH +23 319
#note Now he's right on my tail and it's going to come down to who can bingo first. Unfortunately, I can't yet. I'm also keeping the stupid U. Hard to know what's best, but with ZXQ (and the Y to a lesser extent) unseen hopefully he'll be stuck with one and that gives me more time. I could try to open another bingo spot but I'm probably better off to try and hit SWOT before he does.
>Chris_Williams: Q 8L Q. +21 316
#note Lucky me.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EELRTU 3F LU. +5 324
#note Still no bingos because the U is stupid. Shut up Quackle I'm not playing TUREE(N). (EM)U would be a good fish except it creates another hard-to-block opening, and the idea is for Chris to not bingo after I do.
>Chris_Williams: EN 7C NE +13 329
#note Chris got kind of unlucky here, after I found out what was still in the bag.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEILRT A6 sTERILE +77 401
>Chris_Williams: EIORTYZ 10F ZI. +37 366
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ISX B11 aXIS +30 431
#note Chris must have had EEINORT because I don't think he would have kept the Z or Y - I couldn't believe I drew ?ISX after my bingo. And I missed 40 points up top.
