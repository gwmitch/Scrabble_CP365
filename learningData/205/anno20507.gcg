#note I hated this leave... Considered POO, but that left the G. I still think it would have been better. It's simming second right now. POI is simming above it, which seems weird... Why?
 GOYIM would also have been better for the sake of leave. I don't know if I've ever thought of that word in a Scrabble context.

>Randi: CDEIOTY M3 COY +24 46
#note We're number 1! We're number 1!

YOM and MYOTIC are also simming well... I don't know if I knew MYOTIC. Seems like a lot of turnover? YOM keeps the C, but scores 8 fewer points. Is it worth it?

#note I think this was my favorite play of this game. Yay points.
>Margo: DEOT L10 DOTE +21 140
>Randi: DEEIORV I4 VIE +8 193
#note This was a terrible play and I think I did it because I didn't know what else to do. This clearly wasn't it, though.
>Margo: AHW G9 HAW +22 162
>Randi: ADEIORR 13D DEAR +20 213
#note See previous play.
>Margo: ?Z F10 Za +65 227
>Randi: AIINORU -IIOU +0 213
#note Clearly still didn't know what to do. I really like IO(DID) (which is simming at the top right now. I definitely didn't think of it (or anything else, for that matter). Thought about keeping one of the I's and probably should have. 
>Margo: BEN K3 NEB +30 257
>Randi: ANNPRUX J2 XU +27 240
#note REDUX would have been better. Didn't see it, which is not overly surprising considering my last few plays. 
>Margo: AGL M13 GAL +16 273
>Randi: ADNNPRS 11D PR..N +18 258
#note Oh hey I at least had the right idea here. I played the R because I thought the leave would still be good enough and i wanted another chance at another vowel. I played the P instead of the D because points. PAWN is simming #1 and 4 points better than PRAWN at #2... I suppose the leave is that much better.

Oh right. PAWN takes an S. I just realized that. I'm the (s)martest.  
>Margo: AL 14I LA. +12 285
>Randi: AADEFNS 15A FA +20 278
#note Woo #1. 

Its worth noting that we have the scores very wrong. Like, very very wrong. Like, I think I might not have actually won. We kept checking them and agreeing, though. 
>Margo: IJLT G3 JILT +22 307
>Randi: ABDENSS N8 BADNESS +87 365
#note Oh phew. We fixed the scores here. That would have been badness :).
>Margo: IQ O7 QI +45 352
>Randi: EEKLRUW 5D KEE. +16 381
#note No idea what to do here. LUX is simming #1, but it seems unnecessarily risky. I feel like even though I'd have kept high point tiles to use up there, I'd be very unlikely to get to. CUE is simming 2nd, but that seems to present the same problems. I'd have awesome plays there next turn, but I'm highly unlikely to get to make them, since there really isn't much of anywhere else for her to play. I am theoretically up for set-ups, but in this case? 

 Other plays where I played are simming higher as well (WELL and WEEL) and I get why for both of them. Others (in other places) are as well.
>Margo: COO H1 COO +24 376
#note Iiiii wanted to do that! But I had none of the tiles. 
>Randi: LRTTUUW D2 LUR. +16 397
#note Oh hey guess what... when there aren't many tiles left and you keep a U, you're rather likely to end up with 2 of them. Right...

Didn't think of TURK

#note I missed TWIT? Good grief.
>Margo: EINR O11 EN +8 407
#note Good thing she missed her out. Ridic.
>Randi: TTU 3A TUT. +8 411
#note And I didn't miss mine. 

My play this game was very extreme - good plays and terrible ones. The terrible ones were generally because I didn't know what to do.
