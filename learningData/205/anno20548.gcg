>Dan_Wachtell: ILNNSUY 8F SUNNILY +78 78
#note Finals, playing for 1st. I have to win by 140 or so. I spot SY when he draws. I know what's coming. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEGLL L3 GALLE. +20 20
#note But this time I don't start off by missing a bingo, so it's OK! But the same thing happens otherwise.
>Dan_Wachtell: AEEIOQV F6 QI. +32 110
#note I am transforming into a division 2 player. In both games, Dan has started with a bingo and proceeded to play off 2 power tiles for around 30 in his next two turns with two short plays that completely cripple the board.
>Joshua_Sokol: BCEINOU 3I BOU.IE +24 44
#note Almost CONCUBINE! 
>Dan_Wachtell: AEEIOVZ 6L .EZ +32 142
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIIMNR 2N MI +16 60
#note But how do you strive forward once you realize after you've made a really desperate play that you missed a bingo you knew existed and yet didn't take the time to look for? How do you stay strong? :P
>Dan_Wachtell: AEEIOTV 1L TOEA +26 168
>Joshua_Sokol: ACINRTY 2H NAY +31 91
#note The answer to that is: you don't. You continue to spiral downwards, much like a tyrant!
>Dan_Wachtell: ADEIMVV 1E VIVA +36 204
>Joshua_Sokol: CDGIIRT G7 D.CI +17 108
#note Bad move.
>Dan_Wachtell: ?DEEHMR F10 HERM +30 234
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIRRTX M6 .X +34 142
#note Bad move!
>Dan_Wachtell: ?DELNPT J5 sPL.NTED +68 302
#note Dan's word knowledge played tricks on him this game
>Joshua_Sokol: CGINRRT 11A CRING. +18 160
>Dan_Wachtell: EEIKOPT A6 TOEPI.K +60 362
#note As I said. But I had given up and this should be a word anyway
>Joshua_Sokol: AEORSTU C6 OUTRA.SE +70 230
>Dan_Wachtell: ADEGHIR H10 DRAIGH +43 405
#note This one I really didn't like though. I will remember! Dan didn't think of HERMA being valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABJORSW B4 JAW +35 265
#note Why didn't I play JOW?
>Dan_Wachtell: AEEEFFW K11 FEW +31 436
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEOORS 15C BROOc.ES +63 328
#note no HORSEBOY*. We checked afterwards.
>Dan_Wachtell: ADEEFOO L12 FEOD +39 475
#note Mr. Wachtell hadn't realized the bag was empty.
>Joshua_Sokol: ANRSTTU 4B .AUNTS +26 354
#note And we both missed (P)A(R)EO until it was too late.
>Dan_Wachtell: AEO I7 A.E +11 486
#note I played the better endgame :)
>Joshua_Sokol: RT 13K ..RT +14 368
>Joshua_Sokol:  (O) +2 370
#note Congrats to Dan for a well-deserved 1760 and tournament win! This was a really fun tournament.
