#note Would have played GERAH if this higher scoring bingo didn't materialize. GERAH actually sims better than DAUGHTER too! I figured the U really devalued the blank here, and that the board was so open for potential that immediate scoring took precedence over future scoring which seemed bountiful with most draws.

#note Tacking on the E seemed like a good idea here in order to hinder bingo options and force fishes to use 2 tiles or less instead of 3. YOWE sims best on many-plies.

#note I had about 6-7 minutes for this play. I saw ARGOTIC, and spent about 4 minutes retracking/scouring for bingos I might have freakishly missed through the I or off the T. Then with about 2 minutes left I was like OH CRAP THE L. With TRAGICAL possible, it was apparent that I was no longer 100% to win after any play. Blocking ARGOTIC is best though, because Chris is more likely to have it than TRAGICAL - strangely I didn't figure this out during the game, (I guessed LAT left ACIRT which draws equally to both and chose to block the one that's easiest to find, but fishes without the A are reasonable).
