#note nope. stop playing thru stuff! this is an exchange rack. looks like i need to bring the old rule of thumb back someone taught me a long time ago; if it scores less than half as much as your average play and your leave is still bad, exchange. (-9)
>rachel: DENOV 11E DOVEN +30 42
#note not to mention it's not a good play defensively. the board is pretty ugly after ZAX/GOX and I'm ahead. there's no reason to do gaff.
>cesar: ADKMNTV 10D DAM +25 77
#note dank 12H or VODKA F10. i always miss vodka. (-10)
>rachel: OSW 12D SOW +24 66
>cesar: KNOTTVW J4 KNOT +19 96
#note how i wish, how i wish i'd exchanged. we're just too many consonants swimming in my rack, turn after turn. 13F NOWT is slightly better because of defense partly. (-1)
>rachel: AEINRST D3 STRAINE. +70 136
#note meanwhile she was grooming her rack and i still have VW and now i'm down. i bet GAFF sims even awfuller with 6+ ply.

#note i didn't spot VEGIE at K1 or B2 unfortunately, which have got to be better than my play. i'd prefer B2 though. (-3)

>cesar: EEGILOY 4H YO.EL +32 196
#note although YOGI B8 is interesting, it seems pretty unnecessary right now.

#note my plays are better when i don't have clunky tiles. which means i have to both avoid having clunky tiles and practice finding plays with clunky tiles.

#note except here, where i completely missed ACRImONY. i think i would have found it with an M on my rack, but i was actually pretty low on time already and YOGI scores quite a bit. quackle only thinks i lose 12.5 equity points which is interesting; i only really have two lanes though that can be both blocked with something like 8B BEN/something.

#note i didn't play this well, especially at the beginning, and i had an inkling of that when i posted something on FB about needing to play better in the afternoon. someone asked what's wrong with 2-1? but that wasn't the point.
