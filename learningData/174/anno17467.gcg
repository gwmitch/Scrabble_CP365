>BJ: ?EEKORU 8F UKE +14 14
>Jeffrey: NRSTTTU -TT +0 0
#note Quackle likes STUNT E5, (with the greatest 2-tile leave RT) for 18 points, 8 equity points better than the exchange. I thought about T(U)T but liked the exchange better, perhaps illogically, right at the beginning at least.
>BJ: ?AEIOPR E5 sOAPIER +92 106
#note Lucky me, easy word to find and it looks like I set myself right up for the double-double.
>Jeffrey: EHNRSTU I2 HUNTERS +73 73
#note Ok so my fish worked, and good thing because he had a bingo rack.  I thought about trying (PUKE)R# on him, knowing it was no good in our book, but didn't want to chance it, especially since he might not see/ know the front-hook for my binger (fingers crossed)
>BJ: AEMOOSV 1D VAMOOSE +109 215
#note JN: Ouch, no such luck!  Bold playing rewarded.  In truth SHUNTER still sounds funny to me, but more importantly I asked myself 'Is HUNTERS the only word in that rack'?  Usually remembering how many anagrams in a set pays, and this one I remembered as 2.  BJ said he wasn't completely sure because of the other spelling, VAMOSE, but I also speak Spanish, so I knew it was good right off. BJ: Yup even thought VAMOOSE is burned in my brain from childhood cartoons, I doubted myself because of VAMOSE and nearly didn't make the play. But knew I'd regret it if didn't try and it turned out to be good. As for SHUNTERS, I must've seen it before because I had no doubts and thought of it immediately. I know I haven't studied it yet.
>Jeffrey: EILOORW D10 WOO +19 92
#note Oh lonely orphan bingo, please forgive me while I break you up.  I considered OW F5 but negged it in favor of giving myself another hook for 7s- Q likes the OILER leave plenty (-4)
>BJ: AEILLOT D1 .IOL +14 229
>Jeffrey: AEGILNR 5G AL.ERING +68 160
#note I had plenty of bingos hooking WOO but wasn't about to waste the slutty spot, I'd much rather take the harder one this time. (TRIANGLE / TANGLIER / ALERTING / RELATING / INTEGRAL)  
>BJ: AAEIILT M2 LIA.A +10 239
#note AALII is obvious in retrospect. Oh well.
>Jeffrey: ?DEPSTY L4 Y.P +30 190
#note DE(I)TY 2B was the star play here, and I would have taken it if I had seen it and not been too invested in finding a -TYPES bingo (-16)
>BJ: BEIRTVZ 2A VIZ.R +36 275
#note Shouldn't have missed BORTZ at C3. Feh.
>Jeffrey: ?DEGSTT 6D T.G +8 198
#note A bunch of F7 plays here I didn't stop to notice, best of them G(U)TTED, -14
>BJ: BEELNRT A1 E.ENT +27 302
#note Somehow I got tunnel vision and felt I had to block the triple-triple line. I hardly looked anywhere else, missed about a zillion better plays. I would not have known the one bingo, however (REBLENT).
>Jeffrey: ?DEEFST 13B DEFEcTS +82 280
#note Ack*!  I chickened out on this at C7 because I couldn't remember if COR was good (sigh) -10
>BJ: ABELNRW B10 WAN.ER +36 338
#note Almost went with WANDLE instead of WANDER.
>Jeffrey: DJNOSTU A7 JUDO +41 321
#note I was going to play H11 JU(S)TS until he opened this up
>BJ: BBEI 15A B.IBE +36 374
>Jeffrey: DFNNRST J5 .F +26 347
#note This felt wrong to keep such a vowel-free rack but it's not so bad and hey, 26 points!  I need this game to run slower anyway
>BJ: AACILTX H13 .AX +30 404
>Jeffrey: DMNNRST B1 N.M +11 358
#note again missing F7 plays
>BJ: ACT 2K TA.C +12 416
>Jeffrey: DINORST H8 .D +3 361
#note Dang, if I had made the blank an A I'd have DIATRONS here (/INTRADOS) but I was too defensive.  I guess I'd better stick out a hook I know he can't use and whistle past the graveyard
>BJ: ADEHILQ 10D ..LD +10 426
#note Couldn't quite dump my Q and block the new bingo lane at the same time. Was totally oblivious to the lane starting with the G at N5.
>Jeffrey: GINORST B6 GO +16 377
#note ok so I made my fish, but STORING blocked, now RO(A)STING (/ORGANIST) is the binger I Coulda Shoulda Woulda.  I was down to a minute or so here and blew my chances to analyze it properly- fishing off the T gives me the best chance to win with ORIGINS, ERINGOS,  ORIGANS, or a U for (A)ROUSING. I was so short on time I had no accurate tile report tho.  And BJ said he may have blocked at 12G if I had 1-tile fished again.   
>BJ: AEHIQUY 3H Q.A +12 438
#note Badly wanted to play YEH for 34 but felt I had to dump my Q or risk being stuck with it. Had to forgo dumping the Q last turn because of the need to block. Was so focused on the Q-dump spots from the previous turn that I failed to notice QU(A) at G3 since I had just acquired a U.
>Jeffrey: CIINRST C7 TIC +20 397
#note So the game is lost at this point, just minimizing spread with the out-in-2.  It turns out BJ didn't even have to block STORING/SORTING to win, as there were many fine plays through that, but whatever...
