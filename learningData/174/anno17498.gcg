#note chose this cause of my X. An X inference will sometimes interfere with his play and other times I might still have a spot. He held this for around a minute. Neither of us were sure this spelling was also valid. We both know HEMPIE. I was mostly sure this was also good, and it is. 
>Jason: EJLO I7 JOLE +32 32
#note Jole Wapnick
>Josh: ADENOSX J5 AXON +42 80
#note DES is much better than ADS but maybe I should still play EXON because of the T(AXON) hook I'm giving him. Or I could play 11F DA(P)SONE setting up another X spot but I really doubt that's worth the points sacrifice and giving up my S. 
>Jason: AEGRRST 4G GARTERS +80 112
#note Or maybe I'm just results-oriented and AXON is totally the right play.
>Josh: ACDEESU J10 DEUCE +24 104
#note I guess I forgot how good CEDES was as a leave which caused me not to consider/see K4 (E)AU, which seems to be the best equity play. I felt a bit behind here which is why I decided to set my S up, which is kind of dangerous since the D hook is there too. He has 7 shots at DDDSS, so probably around 1/3 of the time this play is going to fail. I don't know if this is the right play or not given that. Maybe K8 EDUCE? I guess there's no need to panic at this stage in the game and DEUCE was sort of panicky. There were other options.

#note Pretty sick draw. 
>Jason: CIU D12 CUI. +18 169
>Josh: PQRSSVY K2 PR.Y +28 230
#note Ooh, I like 12G S(Y)R(U)PY althought it probably isn't the right play! I felt there was no need to expose that I had SS at this point in the game and play something like S(U)Q. The hook I'm setting up hardly benefits me, and besides, I will still have the play next turn a large proportion of the time. This play scored, allowed me to hopefully draw a vowel or two and use the U next turn for more and keeping the board pretty tight.
>Jason: BFU M1 FUB. +18 187
#note no dice for Jason at this point. I don't think this play is right though, since it takes out his best bingo lane.
>Josh: DQRSSVW 2F VR.W +18 248
#note Oh, I could have kept the Y and fished for (HON)EY___ words! Again I didn't feel like S(U)Q was necessary at this point with 1) Jason possibly being able to bingo with a blank and pluralize SUQ and 2) the capacity to close down what's really left of the bingo lanes for Jason. I stand by this play despite Quackle thinking S(U)Q is a tad better.

>Jason: AIIINOR --  -14 187
#note It's hard to challenge Jason when he plays 5s, but this looked really wrong
>Josh: DEIIQSS 13C Q.ID +28 276
#note I don't know, do I play EQUID or EQUIDS? I thought that maybe he didn't have an E after his play.
>Jason: BDELRR B11 BRED +29 216
#note darn. Guess it could have been worse.
>Josh: EIKNSST F10 KIN. +19 295
#note Hmm, I guess if I'm to be worried I should see L4 and play KIST K8. I think I should play KIST anyway. I believe I only saw the possibility of KISS.
>Jason: GL 2K .L.G +14 230
>Josh: ADEGSST 1M .AD +24 319
#note I still wanted Jason to think there were two s's for him to draw here, which is why I decided to save GETS K7 for next turn and induce a mistake hopefully. This is probably not the right idea again.
>Jason: ?AIINRT A5 INeRTIA +72 302
>Josh: AEGLSST K7 GETS +30 349
#note Why chance a fish that might not work? I don't agree that I should play (JO)G over scoring. 
>Jason: AHIO 13J .HIAO +20 322
>Josh: AELOOST 5G OE +19 368
#note Here is probably by far my biggest blunder this game. At this point I'm certain CHIAOS* is valid and that maybe Jason doesn't know that. It's actually completely the opposite and had I hit a bingo next turn I would have really thrown the game away basically by playing CHIAOS*. Jason played CHIAO knowing it took no S, when I thought the opposite occured. I also was blind to the Z, so I should play (Z)OO or A(Z)O instead of this. Or actually I should play ALOE at 5E or maybe even TOOL. Maybe not though since they don't score much more and leave me much less likely to bingo. 
>Jason: OO 1H .OO +17 339
>Josh: AAELOST F1 A.O +6 374
#note again I had no idea what to do here and I likely made a rather large mistake in fishing again, thinking CHIAOS was good still. The sim thinks I should play 12L TALA or OAT. I think OAT looks right. I missed it. Ugh. I wanted to create another lane so that if I had a bingo I would be sure that it was playable and that if Jason had a bingo I could still win. 
>Jason: AEIIMTW 14M WIT +21 360
#note This is the most important turn, and it seems Jason made the right gamble, according to the sim. This awards him the highest bingo percentage of all of his options. 
>Josh: AEELNST E3 LEANEST +66 440
#note But it turns out he should have played it at E3 so that I would probably lose by playing CHIAOS*. He would have won in that case... Turns out him making the right play aided me more than it did him. 
>Jason: AEEIMNT M12 N.. +6 366
#note So my play always wins apparently, but I didn't know I was going to get stuck with this! Maybe he has a winning sequence here, he came quite close. Quackle's sequence has him 2 points worse off than the one he came up with.
