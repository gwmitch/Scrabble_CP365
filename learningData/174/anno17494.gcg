#note 13 minute ISC game. 1F placement sims 1 better. I couldn't tell the difference, and hoped to draw ENWX.

>Richard: AAEISST 10G T.ASE +17 105
#note AIS 13B seems more effective here.
>dacrON: BCELOPU A8 BOUL. +21 145
#note Didn't know BOUCLE, and missed PU(E)BLO (will be studying that range next...). No excuse for COUPL(E) or COUP(E) being missed.
>Richard: ACIINNS B7 CAIN +18 123
#note NIACINS.
>dacrON: ACDEGLP 12J PAGED +26 171
#note Totally forgot the C hook for OVERTUrE. CLAG is better than this.

#note I thought of the sim winner, LIB(E)L. Apparently he averages 6.5 points more after this! Wouldn't have thought that.
>Richard: HIKMNRS M11 M.RK +20 177
>dacrON: CNNORSU 13C NO +12 202
#note This was a gross overestimation of how much CNRSU would bingo next turn. I wanted to play M2 CORNUS, but was afraid if he bingoed back that I was sunk. I felt like I was making a mistake here, and sure enough, I was. Should've just gone with my original instinct and played CORNUS, or even NOR 6H, another play I considered here. Also, he's only predicted to bingo 14% of the time after CORNUS...
>Richard: ?AHINSV M2 eVANISH +84 261
#note M2 kNAVISH might be slightly preferrable herre.
>dacrON: CNORRSU 5G RUNCOR.S +70 272
#note dunno...I thought it might be good, and I have a history of getting phoneys past Richard as it is.

>Richard: AEEHITU 1H HEAT +28 363
#note the slick 6J HI wins 83%, as does N10 HIDE. This play gives me a Q spot, although still wins quite often if I have the Q.
>dacrON: EGGILOQ 2G QI +16 378
#note Low on time (this was a 13 minute game), I make what appears to be the only play. However there is a win here! I noticed that this gave him EMEU, which was enough to win, but if he missed it, I'd be set. (TA)U isn't the most normal 2 to make 3...can you find my win? I wonder if I could've found it had this not been a quicker game.

#note N10 MI(D) is better by 5.

#note Lucked out here, but sad I didn't have an extra 12 minutes to find my win. BTW, it's LO 14B for 7.
