>Cecilia_Le: EO 9G OE +11 11
>JD: AANORSU F9 RUANA +10 22
#note RUANA can't be right, especially with the knowledge that her rack is probably close to bingoing - exchange AU looks like the best I cando.

>JD: IILMNNP --  -26 182
#note yuck, wishful thinking on this play. she challenged pretty quickly. LIPIN for 14 is my best choice.
>Cecilia_Le: FO F1 OF +31 231
>JD: IILMNNP 6A LININ +17 199
#note now down 50, it seemed like I needed to make a play that could open the board more subsequently.
>Cecilia_Le: EEHLV G12 EH +26 257
#note she put down LEVEL and then picked it up again. stupidly. I forgot to remember that she had those letters.
>JD: EIMNOPZ A6 .EZ +36 235
#note she had taken a lot of time on her previous move so I started trying to fast-play her from this move onward.
>Cecilia_Le: DJ C3 DJ.. +24 281
#note she made this play quite fast.
>JD: DHIMNOP K11 PHI +30 265
#note when I got this play down quickly she had to take a lot of time with her next move.
>Cecilia_Le: BOR 10B BR. +11 292
>JD: ?DEEMNO M9 DOE +19 284
#note the big vowel shortage in the bag means that my choice of DOE sims poorly. EM at M11 scores almost as much but keeps a much more potent leave. similarly, MON at M9 is reasonable given that I am likely to draw 3 consonants. tried to make this play quickly to keep her on the clock.
>Cecilia_Le: AELRV N6 VELAR +28 320
#note if I'd remembered that she had VEL I might have been more reluctant to make an opening that she could easily block, but I have to open the board on my last play and make her work.
>JD: ?DEIMNP O7 MIsPEN +51 335
#note on a rapidly closing board I figured I would take my points an maybe draw a challenge. she was now down to only a couple of minutes.
>Cecilia_Le: CEERSTU -  +0 320
#note she challenged because she didn't think she could win given the clock situation. ECU would be a pretty scary move for me at this point - with only three vowels left (and the one S) there are many times when I will have no good response (and even if I block for 4 points, she can just pass me by hooking CRANKS).
>JD: DLMNSVW I7 D.S +22 357
#note it's an even game from here with my vowelless draw, says quackle.
>Cecilia_Le: CEERSTU N12 UTE +8 328
#note her actual rack. I think this is a pretty good try under the circumstances. she really needs to draw the Y for cranky or something of the sort.
>JD: LMNTVWY O14 MY +25 382
>Cecilia_Le: AACEORS D4 O..C +30 358
>JD: GLNTVW E3 TW.. +20 402
>Cecilia_Le: AAERS 14A AREAS +19 377
#note I got her over by a minute total.
