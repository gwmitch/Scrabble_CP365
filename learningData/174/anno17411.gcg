#note I'm not sure whether I knew IATRICAL.  I learned this more recently than I wish to admit but I do like that I'm finally finding the high-prob 8s that aren't THAT easy to anagram over the board.  I know I missed this on Zyzzyva many, many times...

#note Now I see why Marlon whines so much about people benefiting from their own errors...  If I'd seen/thought of IATRICAL I couldn't have played this.  Of course, I'd have still had URBANEST probably, but would I have found it?  Knowing me and my inability to find UNEASIER and ANSERINE, I am a force of chaos so there is no way of knowing what I'll find on any given turn...

This was my first set of three straight bingos in a tournament game.  I refuse to say bingo-bango-bongo because that is so stupid.  Oh, whoops.  I just did.

#note Wow, I could have made it four!  I don't know SIDEBAND at all though...  I wonder why on earth I didn't play this hooking the E in FERIAE though.  Just a bizarre oversight I guess.

#note Hahaha, now look at what I just drew.  Now I'm going to benefit from playing the wrong BID just like I benefited from playing the wrong bingo earlier...  Yeah, I'd get annoyed at being luckboxed like this too...

I suppose keeping the J and hoping for an A (especially when there were only 3 left) was way too cute, but there's no way after this play that he could know that's what I was doing...  Still, just playing JAB or JEEP is clearly better than waiting for an A that might never come.  Having said that, my lead is so massive I suppose it doesn't matter what I do unless I give him two triple-triples...

#note This is the point where I clearly should have given up on fishing for TAJ, especially because JISM was available (which I didn't even see, and would have blocked his 120-point bingo).  I really do get frustrated at myself for being unable to find obvious scoring spots because I'm not actually looking for them...  Certainly I'm capable of finding plays like JISM, but I was just preoccupied with TAJ, just like being preoccupied about WOORALIS against Dan, but that was a lot less costly.  To my credit, I was also preoccupied in blocking bingo lines and I'd say the bingo line I blocked was a tad more obvious than the column C bingo line, but the column C bingo line was much more dangerous scoring-wise, so I kind of needed to play there...  Once again, it doesn't matter, but I'm really disappointed by my play here.  At least I still won, and at least he made an attempt at a stirring comeback that was fun to watch, but a true expert would have cinched this and won by 200 points instead of attempting to rack the score in stupid ways and not playing defense.

>Sean_Wrona: IKNOSUW 8A KO.N +27 498
#note Man, did I miss the hotspot here or what?  Those 3G plays are so cool.  It's clear once I had no chance of losing this, I actually stopped thinking.  This could explain many of the games I choke.

#note He slid this past me really nicely.  I was almost certain this was bad, yet for some reason I didn't even think of holding.  The intimidation factor again?  While I certainly did play this game worse than he did (as is to be expected), I'm STILL probably overestimating the difference in our ability too much and not playing (in this case challenging) confidently enough...  Having said that, I was still surprised that he thought it was good (as he did) and I thought it was bad and I was right, just like my instinct was right against Ben on UNITABLE and then I chickened out...  I guess I assume that 1800s/1900s seem to know everything on lockdown and I'm shocked when I know something is phony and they don't...

#note I had no idea whether SODDING was good during the game.  I don't know my pluralized gerunds very well at all (I still shudder at questioning FIRINGS in the game I choked against Matthew O'Connor en route to losing the Syracuse one-day in March 2013) and I somehow thought this was possible.  It's not.
>Stefan_Rau: ?EIMOU 14H MEOUIn. +11 425
#note And with this I found a way to somehow turn a game I should have won by 200 points into a 70-point win...  But on the flip side, I managed to beat Stefan Rau twice in the same tournament (which I'd BETTER do considering how much I luckboxed him both times).  Having said that, I expected him to clobber me, just as I expected Mack and Joe and Scott to clobber me, and besides that one game with Ben, nobody really did even when I played poorly...  I think this does prove I have potential.
