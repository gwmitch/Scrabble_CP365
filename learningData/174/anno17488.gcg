>Kolton: AAENRUW 8D UNAWARE +72 72
#note I like this placement because he might not know that it takes an S, setting up a big play for later.
>Alec_Sjoholm: IJO F6 JI.O +27 27
>Kolton: ?AEHTTW J3 sAWTE.TH +73 145
#note This is best. The only other bingos are low scoring variations of thwart
>Alec_Sjoholm: EGPR 4H GR.PE +20 47
>Kolton: BINPQRT H6 TR.NQ +14 159
#note Q(U)IP? eh maybe. Q(U)BIT? eh no. Exchange BPQ? meh.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ?AEIILT 11B LAITIEs +76 123
>Kolton: BEEIINP B10 B.EEP +30 189
#note K2 PI(P)E and K4 (P)EIN come out on top, followed by B10 B(L)INI (which I laid down initially but took it off the board when his expression seemed to change ((I have a pretty good read on him))). Quackle says my play is 6th best, but I think it is first best.
>Alec_Sjoholm: AXY 5J .AXY +51 174
>Kolton: AGHIINV A7 VIGA +28 217
#note Both 13A H(E)AVING and A6 VIGIA are valuated about 2 points better
>Alec_Sjoholm: FMOR A12 FROM +54 228
#note Alec is a pretty good player. And a damn fine tile drawer!
>Kolton: BHINNOU H1 HUN. +24 241
#note I didn't even consider 3L HUB. And apparently BUN(G) is a little better.
>Alec_Sjoholm: DD C11 .DD +25 253
>Kolton: ABDIINO 10D BI +10 251
#note I knew that this play wasn't going to win a sim. But the board is pretty closed right now and I figured that leaving a bingo prone rack was really important because there was a really good chance that he would open something up.
>Alec_Sjoholm: COS M2 COS. +27 280
>Kolton: ADEINOT K9 ION +13 264
#note Quackle has no good ideas here. Maybe just (J)O(T)? It also suggests 2M (C)OD which I guess isn't terrible given that a D in the second position isn't very easy to hit given that I am inferring an ERS leave.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ERTY L9 TYER +28 308
#note It's very possible that he had COSTERS on his rack when he played COSY
>Kolton: ACDEOTZ 7A .AT +7 271
#note I really thought that he was going to bingo so I was trying to get cute and set up ZED for 66
>Alec_Sjoholm: FGU 6B FUG +30 338
>Kolton: CDEEOUZ 1G C.EZ +18 289
#note I am pretty flustered at this point. M12 ECU setting up ZED again is best. (But I am 99% sure he has AT LEAST one S)
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEILNNS B6 ..N +8 346
#note This is where this game starts getting really weird. His rack had to be this, or something very similar to this, and as he made this play he said something like "Guess I'll have to fish for a bingo like you've been doing", to which I replied "Sounds good, guess I'll have to try to block the only bingo lane"
>Kolton: DEEMOOU F11 .DEM +13 302
#note Quackle says 3B EUDEMO(N) is best, giving me 8% chance to win. But Quackle has no idea the mind games and poker faces and grimacing and sighing that goes on in real life. Q says my play gives me just under 1% winning chances.
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEIKLNS 2K LI.K +20 366
#note This was the rack that I inferred once again. And if it is correct, he missed the sick-nasty 3C LANKI(N)E(s)S for 86.
>Kolton: DELLOOU G5 LO +12 314
#note Missed the star play of D1 DUOLO(G). LO ups my winning chances to 2.5%
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEEINSS D10 ..SE +33 399
#note Once again, this is a 100% inferrence of what I thought his rack was (I wrote them down each of the last 3 turns)
>Kolton: DEILOSU 14E E.ULSOID +63 377
#note Immediately, I see DELUSION at 3A. But, bingoing and emptying the bag and allowing him to bingo out loses me the game. With the unseen tile pool, his options are: O2 SAVARIN (which I immediately tossed aside because I had to bank on the fact that he unduplicated his E's last turn), 13I ERASION EROSION EVASION VERSION, (M)OONRISE (M)ORAINES O(M)NIVORE O(M)NIVORA (the latter 2 are thrown out because he has an S), and 3A AVERSIO(N). 

So, after looking for awhile, I finally come up with EMULSOID. It (most likely) blocks all of his bingos (unless he has AEIORSV). There is also the possibility that he might challenge it (especially if I indeed blocked everything).

Quackle says E(M)ULSOID gives me a winning percentage of 0.00, and DELUSIO(N) 3.5%
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEINORS 3B RAISON.E. +73 472
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEINORS --  -73 399
#note He IMMEDIATELY plays this. It is on the board like 2 seconds after I hit my clock. And I was like, oh crap wtf. That is nasty, nice play dude. I'll challenge it though just for fun.... Went up to the challenge computer and I typed in 2 words RAISONNES and ER because I am a smartass. NO GOOD. Hooray Thank You Scrabble God.
>Kolton: AOV 15L OVA +11 388
#note Quackle can take that 0.00% and shove it. Because I am awesome! (and extremely lucky and fortunate!)
>Kolton:  (ERASION) +14 402
