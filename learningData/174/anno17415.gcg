#note apparently 9F TORII is better...that is counterintuitive to me.
>Margie_Gordon: AITX 8L TAXI +41 55
#note I guess because she averages more from the spot I give back than I do.

#note Scores one more at 10I. I was trying to make a more open board, but maybe this isn't the right turn to do so.
>Margie_Gordon: COY 12I C.OY +18 96
>dacrON: CDEEGII K2 DICIE. +18 84
#note Lots of awful plays here, so I stuck with opening the board, since it seemed clear she would sacrifice to shut it down. K10 EG(O) wins the sim...
>Margie_Gordon: MU 4K .UM +14 110
>dacrON: AEGNRTU 11J .GA +19 103
#note 3I GU(I)NEA wins a sim - this has been a tough game so far.

#note Man, I am just completely at a loss here. Considered all sorts of plays here...

>dacrON: AEEEEUZ C12 .EU +20 327
#note In hindsight, it is pretty hard to lose after (J)EEZ - I overthought this for sure.
>Margie_Gordon: AFS 8A FAS +27 287
>dacrON: AEEEEQZ F2 Q. +31 358
#note At this point, it seemed like I should be able to outrun a lot of bingos from the F just barely. Actually, if she is going to bingo, I think I want her to bingo with the blank, as it scores less, and gives her less outplay options. Fortunately, I was pretty sure she already had the blank.
>Margie_Gordon: IL 2M LI +9 296
>dacrON: AEEEEEZ H13 A.Z +39 397
#note Yes, I made a play leaving EEEEE. O1 ZEE is a spread improvement, but I was out of time and knew I had the win.
>Margie_Gordon: ?ANOORT O1 ONTO +18 314
#note E3 (L)iN(N) is 10 better.
>dacrON: EEEEEI E3 .IE. +22 419
#note I can also throw the I in there for (L)IE(N) for 22, but I forgot there were tiles left other than Es with my 5 remaining seconds.
>Margie_Gordon: ?AR F12 sR. +14 328
>dacrON: EEEE 1G E.E +7 426
#note ah darn there's a better spot to just dump one E!
>Margie_Gordon: A A8 .A +5 333
>Margie_Gordon:  (EE) +4 337
#note What a ridiculous opening game!
