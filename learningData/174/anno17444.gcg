#note this is really interesting, with 5 moves simming pretty close to each other. BOUGH was the obvious choice but i didn't like VIM that much as a leave and for some reason preferred VI by enough over it. I also thought HUMBUG didn't take an S when I played it. OVUM kept too many consonants and I don't like the leave of VUGH. (-1.5)

#note hmm, this was a paranoid move for sure. FEEDS definitely looks better than my play and i'm ahead by enough. i missed 10K SIEVE for 36 points too.  i could also just play FAVE/FIVE M1. i played it too defensively here and kept a mediocre leave, but i just didn't want any big surprises.. nothing wrong with that :/  (-10.5)

#note 12C YEA is fine, no need to give him a spot to dump some clunky tiles for a lot of points and open the board. (-1.5)

#note it doesn't really matter what i play here. i wanted to make it harder for him to bingo and conserve spread.

#note at some point after the first turn i convinced myself that humbug took the S and that i would probably play there or not challenge.
