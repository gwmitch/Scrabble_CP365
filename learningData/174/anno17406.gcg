#note Missed HEX.  Chose this over HERL because I thought it was more defensive.  Thinking about all the hooks PER takes, it's probably not.

#note I was certainly well aware of the SKELPS hook.  I was setting it up, but I didn't think of JIBS or JIGS.  I guess I was getting greedy here for bingo possibilities, but I don't hate this decision anyway since I'm not going to lose with the last S and blank and this way I can at least rack up some spread...  Not that I was in any position to do anything with the additional spread, but still...

#note I guess I screwed up with the tracking thinking there was two tiles left instead of just one.  ZAG is obviously the play (or maybe GOO).  He's lucky QI blocked WENDIGOS/WIDGEONS though.

#note Yep, after ZAG I would have had lots of bingo options as it turned out, but I'm happy I at least found this.  It's great to screw up tracking in a game in which it doesn't matter, instead of a game where it does...  I'm a little annoyed at myself for that, but apart from that and VARUSES, I'm pretty satisfied with my plays.  Of course it's easy with those kind of tiles...
