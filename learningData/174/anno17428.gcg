#note Tough play - 9F VOE looks best here because it makes it hard for Poder to score next turn. He averages 21 points next turn after VOE! Perhaps my play is too open. Thoughts? is the AGIU leave even any worse than AU?

#note I phoned this endgame in for some inexplicable reason - obviously it is right to block the big plays in the top right - GEE(Z) does that most effectively, but I don't think I'd have seen AR(AB)IC as a 2nd outspot ((N)ARIC). This is 12 worse.
