>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: INRSUVZ G8 .ZURIS +26 43
#note Thought about ZINE, BUNS and VIZIR as well. I think I should have played BUNS... more points, more defensive, and I don't burn my Z AND S. Don't know why I settled on the terribly open TZURIS... it's super early and I'm far from desperate here.
>dacrON: ADEEGNT I8 NEGATED +73 133
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ANNNRRV J1 VANN.R +13 56
#note Hated playing this, but it's necessary here. My other option was exch. 4.
>dacrON: EFLOPTT E7 T.EFT +22 155
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: AGNQRUY 1G GRA.Y +36 92
#note I was hoping for QUINS/THEFTS or another Q play with an S draw.
>dacrON: EELMOPT J11 MOLE +21 176
#note Missed (F)L(U) - LOPE is the play here.
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?KNOOQU 13C NOOK. +18 110
#note Setting up sweet Q potential, especially if I draw an S. The ideal situation here would be to draw something like QUASI saving the blank.
>dacrON: ACEEHPT K8 CHEAP +39 215
#note I miscounted CHAPE and thought it scored 39 like this - otherwise I'd have played it. Oops!
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?CFLQSU 14I ..LF +8 118
#note SUQ scores best, but I'm still behind 70 on a dying board with the S-NOOKS spot easily blockable. I considered exchanging CFL, but Conrad is more likely than average to block SNOOKS so I preferred keeping the C in order to open a new lane. And the C isn't that bad... I actually hit quite a few bingos here like CAIQUES, COQUETS, or CIRQUES! Quackle prefers SUQ/TOP by 3%, but I am guessing Quackle has Conrad playing from the C far more than he realistically would given the board, and Quackle can't take into account that Conrad is going to infer a very strong leave.
>dacrON: EEEOSTV M9 VETOES +35 250
#note Is (C)OVET better / is this too timid?
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?CMQSUU 12B CUM +24 142
#note Also considered (E)M(E)U, but at this point I'm getting pretty far behind and can't leave too many points on the table. But CUM isn't really that hard to block whereas EMEU is super hard to deal with. However, Conrad will often have to sacrifice quite a lot to block, and can't fully block without an S or a blank.
>dacrON: ?EIIORW 10B REI. +9 259
#note Seems right to block.
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?DDOQSU A12 SUDD +30 172
#note This play was really really tough. Thought about DO next to VETOES, but I can't come up with any scenario in which Conrad won't block. Also considered the crafty SCUM/SUQ... maybe this is a time to take that risk? I know it will be at minimum partially blocked, but I can still score 60+ sometimes. I think I need to make plays that make it hardest for Conrad to make a decision... if I just go haywire opening lanes without scoring, his choices will be too easy. 
>dacrON: ?GIIIOW 14D OI +9 268
#note I put down 5 tiles here to exchange, then confirmed the score and realized I wasn't up by as much as I thought. So then I decided to make this play instead for some reason...it sims fine, but I'm not sure - what do you do in a spot like this?
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?ABNOOQ 6F BO. +27 199
#note I know Conrad has a poor leave, because he announced exch. 5, checked the score, and then changed his mind. That being said, I preferred BOX in order to keep the R open and potentially make him sweat over exchanging vs. blocking for cheap. I actually can draw BONIATO/GO (or POBLANO) a decent amount after QAT though - something I didn't consider over the board.
>dacrON: ?GIIORW 9A ROW +21 289
#note 7B RIO(T) is a nice play here. This doesn't seem like a very good play.
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: ?ALNOQT A4 QiNTA. +72 271
#note Quackle wants me to not play QiNTAR and to play 8A ON instead. Um what? Sorry Quackle, but you're wrong.
>dacrON: ?AEINSU 9K .I.E +10 299
#note Happy to find this with so little time remaining.
>Rafijicus_J_Sternicus: AAEILLO 8N OI +8 279
#note I was really really really excited to find this play, and had I hit my tiles, this would potentially have been my favorite pre-endgame play of all time. Conrad was very low on time here (~30 seconds). It was pretty obvious that he left S?, but the other tiles could vary a bit given the time pressure he had been in. No matter what I do I have to block the bingo lane, as Conrad is extremely likely to bingo. My hope was that I would draw a lucky (D)IALLAGE with a GI draw, which could happen maybe 1-2%. If I don't hit my fish, there's a tiny chance I can beat Conrad through time pressue.
