>Matt_Canik: ADEIRTT 8C ATTIRED +68 68
#note Eschew the 2 extra points. Thought about playing it 8E to limit 7-L counterbingos, but with ADEIRT to bingo through if she has a 7 she likely has an 8 too. 
>Patricia_Barrett: EEINSSW D1 NEWSIES. +74 74
>Matt_Canik: AABPRUY C2 YAUP +39 107
>Patricia_Barrett: Q F7 Q. +11 85
>Matt_Canik: ABDOORR B2 ARB +33 140
#note DARB or ARB?
>Patricia_Barrett: BELTU C8 .BLUTE +22 107
#note Whoa, ABLUTE*? Just ABLUTED?
>Matt_Canik: DIINOOR 12C .OROID +18 158
#note I saw INDOOR/ABLUTED shortly after I hit my clock and got really mad at myself....
>Patricia_Barrett: AEMUV 11G MAUVE +27 134
>Matt_Canik: ?AEILNP H1 ELAPhIN. +86 244
#note But then I drew this and wasn't mad anymore. I would draw AEILNP? after making a really suboptimal play. 
>Patricia_Barrett: FIKN 12K FINK +27 161
>Matt_Canik: EERTVWY 3G W.VY +21 265
#note V(I)EWY is also good, but this knocks out a few more/better lines. FINKS is still very worrisome though. 
>Patricia_Barrett: AFT 13J AFT +17 178
#note I can't believe I just got a spot to play this!
>Matt_Canik: EEHMORT 14D THEOREM +80 345
>Patricia_Barrett: AOX M9 AXO. +12 190
>Matt_Canik: ACGGNOU N9 GUN. +27 372
#note Not excited about opening the O spot like this, but it's already really dangerous. Not excited about ACGO as a leave... but remember I'm me so it will all be fine. 
>Patricia_Barrett: ADGO O6 DAGO +22 212
>Matt_Canik: ACDEGNO L3 CONGAED +80 452
#note Told you it would be fine!
But I should play DECAGON N1. 
>Patricia_Barrett: EIILRST 15I SILTIER +81 293
>Matt_Canik: CEIJLNS 6J JI.S +28 480
#note I didn't want to think about an endgame- last round of the tournament and I had it sewn up. Just wanted to block a potential obvious outbingo I don't see.
