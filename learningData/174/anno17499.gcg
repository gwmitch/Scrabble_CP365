>Josh: IINNORR H6 IRON +8 8
#note I needed to win this game to win 5 in a row and get moneys, not starting well. What do you play?
>Jason: AEIJLSV 9B JAVELI.S +71 71
#note noooooooooooooooo
>Josh: IMNNNRU 6H .NRUN +7 15
#note wanted to keep the board as open as possible and set up my M maybe. I know it seems futile...
>Jason: CEEHKSS M1 CHEEKS +36 107
#note Big big blunder by Jason here as he chickens out of KE(N)CH, which turns out I would have challenged, as I didn't know it. 
>Josh: DEGIMNP K3 IMP.GNED +78 93
#note a break for me
>Jason: FOY 10A FOY +27 134
#note the wait was excruciating here
>Josh: ADEMPRT E5 TAMP.RED +102 195
#note !!!
>Jason: AIQ 12B QAI. +28 162
>Josh: ?EHIOTT L9 HOTTIEs +76 271
#note I missed gOTHITE and THOrITE at D1 here. I was busy looking for a 3x3 that didn't exist. What did exist was an amazing THOlEI(I)T(E) at 3E! What a word!
>Jason: IYZ 15L .IZY +45 207
>Josh: DEENORU F5 ODE +21 292
#note now that that luck is over I need to see F6 DUE(L)ER. I played this hoping for JONQUIL a bit and fearing the X. It's just not the right play with DUE(L)ER available. 
>Jason: DIR 13A RID +25 232
#note great play here 
>Josh: AEGNTUU 1K UN.UT +24 316
#note this was held
>Jason: IRT N12 RIT. +26 258
#note another great play
>Josh: AEGOOWW A13 .OW +18 334
#note finally some equalizing draws, I liked putting my AEG down and drawing WOWO on my rack as provisionals. Maybe I should play (T)OWAGE O1 here. I decided that I needed to address the bulging threat that was B14 first and missed TOWAGE.
>Jason: AAL J2 ALA +11 269
>Josh: AAEGLOW O1 .OWAGE +11 345
#note now I see it. This is good cause it blocks bingos on lane O.
>Jason: ACERSSU 14C SAUCERS +69 338
#note I don't know what Jason is supposed to do here. SURCEAS(E), SAUCERS or SUCRASE. He took the points which seems right enough
>Josh: ?AEFLLN H12 FA.L +33 378
#note unfortunately I'm a luckbox and I drew the last blank.
>Jason: EX F9 .EX +25 363
>Josh: ?BBEILN O8 BIBLE +33 411
#note NIBBLE(LI)k(E) was briefly considered! My best play is NIBBEd here. I didn't know NIB was a verb so I played it safe. I can't say the same for my next play though. This would have been the best play had my next play been right.
>Jason: AEGOOTV G1 GAVOT +16 379
