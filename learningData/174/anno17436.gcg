#note Yikes - thought MOKE wa Collins - trying hard to settle and not give into more anxiety. Deep breaths, get back on track. I did consider the equally-faring O(V)UM, which simply gives back less. I possibly overvalued this leave, as well - it is quite volatile. Would've played MOKE otherwise.

#note Close call on whether or not to drop the S. This board is so dependent on S hooks right now, that it seemed worth it to save the S for a hopeful bingo next turn. Supposedly I bingo around 30% next turn, which was about what I thought, but I still bingo 15% after VUGS 14J, so my average score increase after VUGH isn't necessarily enough to beat VUGS over a 4ply sim. However, I don't see the reason for a board that depends on S hooks, and I like that this neutralizes two of them. I want to bingo first, and have a shot at the remaining goodies.

>dacrON: DEIISTX 4D XI +20 94
#note Admittedly missed EXIST N10 here - was going between DEIXIS 10C and XI 4D. I think DEIXIS and XI are quite close,  but EXIST is obviously better - tunnel vision! A good example of how my energy was diverted elsewhere - it was taking a lot of strength to stay focused on the game.

#note I thought 10B scored less than it actually did. That said, I was pretty sure after AIOLI that KC wasn't holding a blank or an S (RE(V) strongly suggested an ER leave + TEG and AIOLI, so there seemed to be little reason to open nice tiles for 8s.

#note I thought it was good to block unlikely plays with the B/M/F/P/Y at 4O, as vowels were becoming scarce, and I'd rather force KC to use two vowels at the other hotspots. Quackle says I am full of it. Also, (As)P is a word, so this play falls pray to -PY words. oops.

#note Blind to the word FEH here. Makes BANI better than FINE. Also, stupid (As)P is still there.
>KC_Frodyma: APY O1 YAP +28 317
#note ...oh, (As)P. Also, try to find my best endgame here.
>dacrON: ABHIJOS 12M .AJ +18 384
#note I correctly identified that this was an endgame with a setup, but I missed the best way to do it. OH 2A is the foolproof setup, winning the game by 98 points, as I can THEN play (T)AJ if JAB is blocked. However, although I still get to use the J with TAJ next turn, KC has C(O)G(O)N for an out in two. If I think KC will miss C(O)G(O)N, then playing (T)AJ now is correct. But I just didn't see C(O)G(O)N, period, so I didn't make that decision really...
>KC_Frodyma: CEGMNW 9B .W.EN +26 343
#note So yeah, C(O)G(O)N.
