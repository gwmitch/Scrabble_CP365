#note I pretty much hate everything about this play.

#note just kidding hehe

>Kolton: EEGIORU C9 GOU.IER +20 94
#note Yeah not much else going on here.

>Kolton: AADEFIV 11A VA. +19 113
#note B6 FAVA is interesting setting up two different lanes that could end in ED. I wish I was creative!

#note After a bunch of iterations, this play and 12K AXE AX EX all come out really close
>Dan_Goodwin: ATU 13I TAU +10 145
>Kolton: AELNOSX 12J LOX +33 200
#note This made the board really closed (obviously) which is really strange because Daniel and myself are usually really open-board-type players

#note Actual rack
>Kolton: AABINOP C1 BOP +24 294
#note C2 APIA(N) is the sim winner here
>Dan_Goodwin: ?EIOQST H4 QI. +22 191
#note His rack was this, or something similar to this because he said I blocked Q(U)ESTION
>Kolton: AABINOT D2 BOA +20 314
#note derp ABO 1 space up is worth 1 more point
>Dan_Goodwin: ?EOSTY A7 OY +17 208

#note Q says I3 AIT or AI is worth it
>Dan_Goodwin: ?EGIST 2A G... +7 215
>Kolton: ?AEHINT 10H .H +10 324
#note omg E1 TENIA(E) is superduper. I saw the spot, but the only thing I have written down for that turn is HENT23. My play actually wins the sim by a little bit

#note (V)ERSaNTS 80
>Kolton: ?AEIINT 8H .ANITIEd +83 407
#note I couldn't find a triple-triple. Because there aren't any. If I had passed last turn, maybe Daniel would've still played this and I could've done something like INEARTHS for 11 million points.
