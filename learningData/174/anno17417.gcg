#note this play sims better than I had imagined - I saw BIPOD as well, but BDIL bingoes some more, and I cut his bingo percentage a bit.

#note difficult decision whether to block one of the two lanes or play elsewhere, I didn't like DILUTE because it makes the board more open down the road. ILIAD looks fine too, they all sim quite close.

#note it's definitely not over with a blank, the X and the Z all missing. ZAX for 96 and I would be losing!!
