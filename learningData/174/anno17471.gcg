#note this is going to be a painful first few turns as i stubbornly stick with my Q.

>cesar: ALOOQRS D8 .ALOR +16 40
#note this is a bad mistake, and my reasoning was also bizarre. i thought i wanted to be a tempo up, but it's so early in the game and why would i want to open it? i got kind of carried away here and should have done the clear -OQ. i thought of it for a bit but somehow talked myself into just playing through. (-6)

>cesar: ?ADHOQS 6C DASH +36 76
#note just saw QuASH on quackle, didn't even consider it here. i guess i didn't realize it scored 64 points keeping DO! it's definitely right. (-10.5)

>cesar: BCEEEEQ N2 CEE +14 184
#note i put a sad face next to this rack on my scoresheet. i also need to be more sensical and play N2 BEE instead of CEE. reasoning was that it may be a bit harder to overlap with the C there. but CEEQ > BEEQ. (-4.5)
>olaugh: EP 8L PE +16 164
>cesar: BEEIOQV 5B QI +14 198
#note and this time i should have held on to the Q for another turn? B12 VOE seems decent enough to quackle but i am not liking it. maybe C2 BOVID? this sucks and i should have gotten rid of the Q after turn 1. (-8.5)
>olaugh: INWZ 3J WINZ. +34 198
>cesar: BEEEOTV 4I VETO +25 223
#note i did actually see 4C VEGETE (it's written down in my scoresheet!) what i need to do next is WRITE DOWN MORE REASONING. i don't know why i chose VETO, but it is close. (-0.5)
>olaugh: DGISU C3 GR..S +16 214
>cesar: BEELMOR K7 BO.LE +19 242
#note another tough move!  this time quackle just likes N6 EM. i thought i'd be a bit aggressive, but i dont know what's right. 7K LOB is kind of cool too, or maybe even at 2I. (-2)
>olaugh: ?EGIJSS 12H JESSInG +102 316
#note gah!!! and it still fit even if i'd done EM or LOB!
>cesar: AEIMR 13I MI +16 258
#note who knows what i kept :( i couldn't hit the J though, i remember, and i kept an A for AMI.

>cesar: ABCERRT B8 CAB +28 286
#note quite poor play, that. 14J CARB is a much better play; i have the case E, and the leave is much better suited for bingoing. (-13)

#note um, ok, weird play. i must have been very low on time.
