>Geoff_Tongue: AHHILT 8D HALITH +32 32
>Geoff_Tongue: AHHILT --  -32 0
#note This word seems plausible, but not today!
>Kolton: OSTTUUW 8G TUTU +8 8
#note This is pretty even with exchanging 4,5, or 6
>Geoff_Tongue: AHHILOT 9H HOT +17 17
#note HAH in the same spot leaving TOIL is only very slightly better than HOT leaving HAIL
>Kolton: CDMORSW K3 CROWDS +29 37
#note My play is 3rd best. C(UT)WORM (I just flat out missed) and CWMS sim better.
>Geoff_Tongue: ABHIL 7F BAH +21 38
>Kolton: AIMRTUU 10J AURUM +20 57
#note Got all the U's out of the way pretty quickly
>Geoff_Tongue: ALLPR M8 PL.RAL +18 56
>Kolton: AABEIKT L12 KAB +32 89
#note I am not entirely sure why I didn't play BEAK in the same spot (8 more points and better balance)
>Geoff_Tongue: AENY N12 YEAN +27 83
>Kolton: ?AEINTZ O4 ZEATINs +132 221
#note Pretty great draw. Even if he blocked the O column, I still had 11E double double ZANIEST for 117
>Geoff_Tongue: SSS -SSS +0 83
>Kolton: EFMOQXY G6 Q.. +12 233
#note N5 MY sims best. I saw it, but figured after an exchange he would be less likely to use that spot. I wanted to dump the Q (given that all the U's were abused in my first 3 turns) and take out 1 lane.
>Geoff_Tongue: ADD K13 DAD +14 97
>Kolton: EEFMOXY 15G FOXE. +48 281
>Geoff_Tongue: EJT 14F JET +33 130
#note Having a pretty big lead, I was a little worried about opening the whole bottom left so early (and so easily) so this play was actually really beneficial to me.
>Kolton: EGIMOVY N5 MY +32 313
#note Oh yea! I can still play MY
>Geoff_Tongue: EPR M4 REP +18 148
#note PRE(X) is 25
>Kolton: EGIILOV 4G VIGO. +10 323
#note Why does (JET)E even come up as a top play? Maybe I am underestimating the GIILOV leave? haha. ILE(X) sims on top, but I prefer to play defensively for now
>Geoff_Tongue: ?EGILRS 11D GIlLERS +68 216
#note Oh Ok, now I see why I should've done ILEX. (His only bingo would've been GRISLiE(R) which isn't an easy find)
>Kolton: EILNNST D4 NESTLIN. +70 393
>Geoff_Tongue: EGOV H1 VOG.E +27 243
>Kolton: AEFIINS 15M A.I +9 402
#note Getting greedy here. If he plays at 8A I have a good shot at bingoing again. If he doesn't block rows 1 or 2, I could draw FARIN(O)SE, FLA(V)INES, or (V)INIFIES. Also, I have the case S, so even if he does know NESTLING(S), he would have to make a really low scoring play to block it.
>Geoff_Tongue: CIO 8A COI. +18 261
>Kolton: EEFINNS 12A FENS +42 444
#note Missed my fish. FEES is better because there are still 2 E's unseen.
>Geoff_Tongue: DEEIORW A12 .ROW +30 291
#note Oops, missed O(V)ERWIDE here
>Kolton: AEIINO C3 NAOI +14 458
#note Championship player agrees
>Geoff_Tongue: DEEI E1 EIDE +8 299
#note If he plays DE(X) here, he saves 2 spread points. Starting a tournament with a big win is fun!
>Geoff_Tongue:  (EI) +4 303
