#note This play sucks the least of all of my options. Q puts it on top by 3 points.

#note Didn't like this and wouldn't have played it against other people. WEAVINGS*

#note Challenge
>Matt_Canik: ?AAFOSX 3A FAX.S +55 216
#note Definitely not worried about the 3x3 here- she doesn't challenge as quickly as she did if she possibly had one. 
>Mariah_Smith: EOR H11 ORE +14 84
>Matt_Canik: ?ABDLOQ 6C Q. +11 227
#note Would you play (S)QuAB here for 45? 
>Mariah_Smith: AEGIT 15C AGEI.T +27 111
>Matt_Canik: ?ABDFLO 12A FLAtBO..D +86 313
#note FALLBO(AR)D is valid here. FLATBOARD made a lot of sense to me - I'm sort of surprised it's invalid. 
>Mariah_Smith: JW C11 J.W +26 137
>Matt_Canik: CDEINPR 1E PRINCED +91 404
#note I had about 2 seconds to decide if I wanted to play this- any longed and it becomes more and more implausible. I was quite sure it wasn't good but played it. Quite  dickheaded of me. 
>Mariah_Smith: AEKN A8 KENA. +36 173
>Matt_Canik: AEHINRT 9I THERIAN +66 470
#note Ok now I feel like a dick for playing it. 
>Mariah_Smith: EILMOST N7 LO.MIEST +82 255
>Matt_Canik: ACIIOPR O6 COI. +26 496
#note Prefer this to PAIN because I have the last A and there are two unseen Os. 
>Mariah_Smith: GUUU -UUUG +0 255
>Matt_Canik: AINOPRV K5 PROV. +29 525
#note She has just exchanged 4, and looking at the pool her rack must be pretty nice. I can only assume she threw back UUOE or UUUE or something. I am not eager to draw those but it seems fairly inevitable. This kills off a ton of lanes. This was chosen over PROVEN because I wanted a consonant to go with my dose of UUUs. 
>Mariah_Smith: ?EILMOT 4B MO.TLIkE +83 338
#note Mariah makes a great overlap here!

Also noteworthy: her bingo racks this game were EILMOST and EILMO?T. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEGILN 3I DEALING +77 602
#note I don't know if this is unethical or not, but as I reached in the bag to draw this turn I picked up the 4 tiles that were on top, set them in the other corner, and picked up the 4 remaining tiles. Perhaps I avoided all of the Us through random chance, or perhaps there's merit to avoiding drawing the top tiles after an exchange. Regardless, it's incredible that Mariah exchanged UUU and then promptly drew back UUU while I pull ADEGILN.
