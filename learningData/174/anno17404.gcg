>Nigel: AEEIOUU -AEEIOUU +0 0
#note "Oh dear, it would appear my vowelitis curse is still haunting me."
>Matthew: ?CDERST H5 DES.RuCT +61 81
#note "Excellent! Then my moment has finally come!"
>Nigel: AAIIOOU 5F AU.IO +6 6
#note "That was inmpressive. You literally managed to select the worst possible bingo. Nicely done."
>Matthew: EFGLNTX 4D FLEX +39 120
#note "You're making me nervous!"
>Nigel: AAEIIOU -AEIIIO +0 6
#note "These vowels are making me nervous. I can't hope for victory if I am to be deprived of consonants all game."
>Matthew: GGLNRTY 10F GR.NT +11 131
#note "Well, I mean, I'm not exactly getting balanced racks here, either. You hogging all the vowels!"
>Nigel: AAAIIOU 3C AI +9 15
#note "So sorry... I'd share if I could."
>Matthew: GLOTUYZ 4I LOGY +20 151
#note "Look! OO#! I learned that one from my Collins flash cards!!"
>Nigel: AAAIIOU I3 I..A +7 22
#note "Your ability to memorize and recall words is astounding. I would never have found OO#..."
>Matthew: HINSTUZ H2 UT +4 155
#note "I don't need your sarcasm! Look! Another obscure two. I bet you didn't know UT."
>Nigel: AAAEIOU 12G U. +2 24
#note "Thanks for teaching me that. Really. I'll use it right now."
>Matthew: AHIMNSZ K1 ZIN.S +44 199
#note "Having fun over there? Vowels still giving you trouble?"
>Nigel: AAEEIOO 12F A..O +4 28
#note "Well I mean, I wouldn't call it FUN. But it's certainly a unique challenge. Nevertheless, I am sure my fortune will change sooner or later."
>Matthew: ADEHLMR I12 .H +9 208
#note "Aha! I've spotted a clever play. If I fish off this H and draw a blank, I can play MAZEDLY!"
>Nigel: AEEIIOO 9H .E +6 34
#note "I, just... wow."
>Matthew: ?ADELMR 1I MA.EDLy +57 265

>Nigel: EIIIOOO C7 OIOIOI.E +61 99
>Nigel: EIIIOOO --  -61 38
#note "(Perhaps a phony is the key to victory. He will never know this isn't actually a Maori food fish used as Eastern European currency.)"
>Matthew: EKORVWY B2 YWROKE +58 340
#note "No but seriously. I do actually know a ton of CSW. I was playing dumb to catch you off guard. It's worked, and now I will defeat you!"
>Nigel: EIIIOOO I12 ..O +6 44
#note *YAWN* "Bit early to be claiming victory, eh?"
>Matthew: ADLPRVW 14H V.RPAL +13 353
#note "Did you seriously just play from EIIIOOO? You really should have exchanged..."
>Nigel: EIIIIOO -EIIIIOO +0 44
#note "Oh alright then, but I really don't think it will help my vowel problem."
>Matthew: BCDIMNW L10 WIND.C +30 383
#note "Get anything good."
>Nigel: AEEEEOU 14B EA +7 51
#note "......"
>Matthew: BFMNNPS 11K M.BS +16 399
#note "Mwahaha! Fortune smiles upon me for once! ME!"
>Nigel: AEEEOOU C13 ..E +4 55
#note "Fortune just winked slyly in my direction. Perhaps the tides will begin to turn soon?"
>Matthew: FGINNNP 15A PF.NNIG +47 446
#note "If by "tides", you mean me scoring 47 smackers, then yes!"
>Nigel: AEEOOOU 8F ...E +14 69
#note "Sigh. Alright, perhaps you truly are the better player. I was just lucky all those other times we played."
>Matthew: BHNSTTV 7A T.NS +5 451
#note "Unquestionably so! Any last words?!"
>Nigel: AEEIOOU D12 U. +4 73
#note "You tempt fate."
>Matthew: BHIIQTV N8 BHI.TI +13 464
#note "I tempt nothing! As a final insult, I will make this suboptimal endgame play, sticking myself with unplayable tiles! Now I get to watch as you squirm with your collection of useless vowels!"

>Matthew: QV -  +0 464
#note "What is this sorcery?"
>Nigel: AEIOO 13I .O.. +10 108
#note "Your cockiness was your own demise. If only the CSW dictionary had an appropriate word for this."
>Matthew: QV -  +0 464
#note "No.... NO!.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
