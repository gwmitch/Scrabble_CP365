>Gunther_Jacobi: CHX -XCH +0 0
>Kolton: AACEGIX -AGIX +0 0
#note AECIA leaving GX is dumb. AX leaving ACEGI is plausible, but nah.
>Gunther_Jacobi: BEHLOST 8G HOB +16 16
#note actual rack
>Kolton: ?ACEEEL 9F CEE +14 14
#note CEE is for Correct
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELSSTT 7B STALEST +69 85
#note It's worth 75 at 7G
>Kolton: ?ABEELO J2 BEEfALO +75 89
#note Beefalo is for best
>Gunther_Jacobi: EGPR 3I R.PEG +18 103
>Kolton: AALMQRT 6D LAM +25 114
#note 3 plays in a row Quackle agrees with.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EFIR E2 FERI.. +18 121
#note He spent a long time on this turn

>Kolton: AHOOQRT 8A HOOT +32 146
#note Should've done QO(P)H here
>Gunther_Jacobi: EY 9C YE +23 144
>Kolton: ?AQRSWY 3C WY. +18 164
#note Quackle likes L1 QW(E)RtY for 60. I have a tough time finding non-bingo blank plays.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AERT 4B TEA. +23 167
#note He's got to be close to something here
>Kolton: ?AELQRS G7 ...QEL +18 182
>Gunther_Jacobi: CINTT H11 TINCT +29 196
>Kolton: ?AAIKRS 15H .AmARISK +86 268
#note I had uAKARIS all set up hooking SHEQELS, but this will work. (the only other bingo is CLARKIAS)
>Gunther_Jacobi: AIO M2 A.IO +5 201
>Kolton: DENNNOX 10A EXON +39 307
#note N10 XENON(S) is a bad miss.... Also, this is where this game gets out of hand. (note my leave of DNN)
>Gunther_Jacobi: EIPRV N10 VIPER. +38 239
>Kolton: DGMNNNW -DGNNW +0 307
#note Q says to play through it with something at 2L or 4L. I hate opening up triple lanes with a lead. I exchanged keeping MN because they are helpful letters with the remaining pool IIIIOOUUUU
>Gunther_Jacobi: AGINR A10 .ARING +24 263
>Kolton: IMNUUUU -UUUU +0 307
#note This really actually happened. I exchanged 5 with 12 in the bag and drew all 4 U's. Quackle agrees with putting them all back.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DOVW 13K VOW.D +24 287
>Kolton: ADIIMNN 14J MI +25 332
#note Now I draw a bingo and since we're not playing Collins it doesn't play (IO/INDAMIN). 12L MA(P) comes out on top here. I am still 90% to win.
>Gunther_Jacobi: FG 4L F.G +24 311
#note I have to infer an S here right?
>Kolton: ADINNUU I12 NU +9 341
#note My play is 10th best on Championship Player's list. #1-12L DA(P), #2-N1 UN, #3 11A (A)IN
>Gunther_Jacobi: DJU L10 JUD. +24 335
>Kolton: ADDINUU 12C INDU... +16 357
#note Well, I went from a 106 point lead after EXON to trying to cut spread because I can't win. Even if I can adequately block column O, he can still play SOZIN hooking EXONS. Championship player says 2L D(A)DA is best here. I just really wanted to find an out-in-two at this point.
>Gunther_Jacobi: INORSZ O1 ZINS +51 386
#note He wasn't 100% on SOZIN. And at this point you need to be 100% or you lose.
>Kolton: ADU 15A .AUD +8 365
#note Yikes. I drew 7 U's in my last 4 draws.
>Kolton:  (OR) +4 369
