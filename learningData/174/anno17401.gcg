>cesar: ACIIORX 8F IXIA +22 22
#note i immediately saw ORIXA# with this rack then just plain forgot about ixora or something. i concede that rafi's IXIA at 8H is better than mine, but the difference is still very small, i think. actually, i get these sorts of positions wrong more often than not and i think it's partially because of quackle's strange opening rack heuristic; the static play generator always chooses the more centrally-distributed play first, it seems. (-1)
>rafi: EOOZ 7G OOZE +57 57
#note it could have been worse than that, but not too much worse.
>cesar: CEEORRR 6E REC +19 41
#note i misvalued the EORR leave a little, i thought it would be better than EERR. ORC sims best.
>rafi: AHRTV J2 THRAV. +22 79
>cesar: ELOPRRS 9I PROLE +28 69
#note i don't know if i reasoned out this play correctly. i did not want to do PRO because it seemed like it would give back more points to the 3W than PROLE, even though PROLE is obviously closer. maybe PROLE blocks some big possibilities at L8 like the H, W, Y, etc. (-4) details window though says that PROLE results in more bingos for him, and this makes sense as i'm putting the E out. it also breaks up my leave. i think quackle is right in the end and PRO is probably best.
>rafi: EKU 5C UKE +18 97
>cesar: AEILNRS 10C NAILERS +74 143
#note i was torn between ALINERS B2 and this. ALINERS is two more points but it just seems too volatile. also RENAILS 10C gives back fewer bingos than NAILERS. this is because there is already an open E and an open R elsewhere. i wish i was more clever and could figure this out over the board.
