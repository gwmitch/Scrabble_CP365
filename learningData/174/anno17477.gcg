>Siddharth_Muali: ADLMNPR 8G PALM +16 16
#note Here comes the inexplicably bad game where I was whining about the last play for the entire day. Yeah, you'll see.
>Jason_Ubeika: AIJO 9F JIAO +23 23
>Siddharth_Muali: DILNORU 10B DURION +29 45
>Jason_Ubeika: ABEV D9 B.AVE +20 43
>Siddharth_Muali: ELORRWW C13 WOW +28 73
#note WOW, I hate this play. But nothing else seems worth it.
>Jason_Ubeika: DEHIT 15C .HITED +51 94
>Siddharth_Muali: EILNRRX 14E LINER +18 91
#note An unorthodox play that sims best, finally!
>Jason_Ubeika: DEZ B12 ZED +38 132
>Siddharth_Muali: ACGNRXY 11G ANGRY +24 115
#note Yikes, missed PALMY, missed ANGARY, here comes mistake number 1. A rather chunky 6% one, in fact.
>Jason_Ubeika: IV J6 VI. +16 148
>Siddharth_Muali: ACOOUUX 12K OXO +25 140
#note Yikes, I hate when I have to resort to these kind of plays. At least this is fine.
>Jason_Ubeika: BKNO 13H BONK +30 178
>Siddharth_Muali: ACEGOUU -AGOUU +0 140
#note Because I knew I would have to do this, plus OXO gives up way too many cheap points.
>Jason_Ubeika: EES 12D .EES +14 192
>Siddharth_Muali: ACDEEOT M10 CO.ED +16 156
#note Idk. This seems decent. Opted out of COOEED because of the worse scoring defense and my desire to retain the E despite the unbalanced leave because of the hanging V. DOZED plays are other alternatives.
>Jason_Ubeika: AN A14 AN +10 202
#note Hmm, the tile at the bottom left got cut off my picture. I think it was an N.
>Siddharth_Muali: ?AEGIRT 6D ERGATI.e +65 221
#note hmm, digerati looks nice here. I like this second, not a fan of grievant with 3 esses unseen.
>Jason_Ubeika: IY 10L I.Y +16 218
>Siddharth_Muali: AMPQTUU D2 TUQU. +28 249
#note It seems like anything I do will get hammered in response. Quack still likes this, but maybe I should resort to PUMA, because the easy 7 lane it creates won't score very much.
>Jason_Ubeika: ?AEFRSS 3C S.RFAcES +74 292
#note At least he didn't see FARNESS.
>Siddharth_Muali: AGILMPT E5 P.IG +22 271
#note If I play MAGLIP, my chances of winning aren't total shit. This is a horrible 'second best'.
>Jason_Ubeika: AENORTU 2I OUTEARN +74 366
>Siddharth_Muali: ACEILMT O2 .EMATIC +42 313
#note Aaaaand here's my epic moment of shame. I SAW calamite. I was like 90% sure of it. I stopped tracking, but I knew FH were part of his seven, so I knew I COULD win. But I inexplicably decided not to try CALAMITE. Can someone explain this? Is this the stupidest moment in the history of Scrabble? This put me on tilt the whole day, and while I thought 0-2 was bad, wait until the next day, where I rounded out 2-12.
>Jason_Ubeika: EFHLST L1 H.FTS +30 396
#note I think this is what he played, I wrote down he scored 30, but I rearranged the board when I took the picture.
>Siddharth_Muali: L 7N L. +2 315
#note An okayish game which I still had a miracle chance at winning, but I let it slip.
>Siddharth_Muali:  (LE) +4 319
