#note roland represented the philippines at worlds in the 90s!
>JD: ACEINOX 9B COAX +29 29
#note it;s surprising to me how good of a rack CEINO ends up being after AX, but I think I'm giving him too many free points.

#note he almost played BERCHAMS* here. at least he missed becharms.
>JD: AEIINRU A10 UNAI +18 58
#note I'm down 100 so it might be in my best interest to open the board with something like URANIA, but I thought it was too early to do that. I didn't spot NAIRU which sims even with UNAI. The difference between EI and EIR is big here (8 points)

>JD: EEGIRRT C3 GREET +22 112
#note the Q sim is not that helpful because it wants me to block IMPLE(A)D(S), which he probably will not see. GRIEF is still definitely a better play than what I did, must've just missed it.

#note too bad for me he blocked FAINTISH but he was very likely to take that spot.

>JD: GLLNQUU K5 UN.QU.. +32 332
#note my play sims best but keeping the Q by playing LUNGI gives me a shot at liquor/liquid for a bunch. but I should take the low variance play
>Roland_Filio: EITU 12J ETUI +31 299
>JD: EGILLOS H10 G.LLIE +24 356
#note difficult play, the pool is actually not great so I thought there was a chance I could outrun him even if he does bingo. playing a lot of tiles also gives me a better chance at the blank. quackle suggests SIGLOI as an alternative which scores 3 more and doesn't give him that useful E (none left in the pool).
