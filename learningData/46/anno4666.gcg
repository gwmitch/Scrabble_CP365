#description Adam Logan plays Jason Idalski in Round 6 at the 2009 CanAm
>Adam_Logan: AEEJQTU 8D QUATE +48 48
#note We had a minor delay before this one. Tony was playing Sam. Each wanted to play on their sets; Tony invoked the "I'm going second, I choose equipment" rule for the first game. Sam acquiesced, but refused to play with the double-injection Protiles. Anyway, Sam wanted to switch back to his set for game 2, so Adam and I switched to Tony's set.
>Jason_Idalski: IILORRT 9F TIRO +13 13
#note As I drew tiles for my opening rack, I told myself "no letdown, no letdown." I don't think I listened, as you'll see by the opening two plays. TOR(QUATE) is the only play that doesn't totally suck. (-29)
>Adam_Logan: EEIJNNW C3 JINNEE +43 91
#note I know the "Chuck Norris"-esque stories belong to Dave Wiegand, but I consider Adam the more mythic figure. For example, as he filled out the annotation sheet from game one, I heard my annotator go "whoa." I looked up, and Adam was writing his racks down from memory. No looking at his scoresheet or the board, no hesitation, nothing. As he did the same after this game, she asked: "Can I adopt you?"
>Jason_Idalski: AEFILRU D8 .UALE +28 41
#note It's misses like this that make me wonder if I'll ever be a truly great (or at least consistently in the 1800s) player. Even QUAIL instead is almost ten points better. Just totally inexcusable; where was my brain? (-40)
>Adam_Logan: ACEOOOW 8A CO...... +57 148
#note When you pish away 70 equity points in two turns while Adam Logan scored 148 in three ... you ain't winning. And Adam looks on his way to setting the "high score without bingoing" record.
>Jason_Idalski: BFIRRWY E10 WIRY +31 72
#note I never come close to digging out of this hole I've created. Adam proceeds to draw way better than I, but I have to wonder if that would've been the case had I played TOR(QUATE) or FAILURE.
>Adam_Logan: AEIIOOW -AIIOOW +0 148
>Jason_Idalski: ABBDFIR H4 FIBB.. +17 89
#note I'd catch the COEQUATE hook later, but not now. FID(O). (-3)
>Adam_Logan: AEGMOOU 4B M.AOU +14 162
>Jason_Idalski: ADEEKOR I7 AD. +31 120
#note Duck likes OKE, F13. I don't know if it's time for me to get suicidal yet. (-5)
>Adam_Logan: AEGGIOR 4H .OGGIER +24 186
#note Crap. ??SSSS all unseen and he's playing six. Better try to keep up in the turnover battle.
>Jason_Idalski: EEKLNOR N2 KE.NEL +24 144
#note Got carried away with "must play at least five tiles". KOEL at 3L is way better. (-14)
>Adam_Logan: ?AEHTUV O6 HAVE +37 223
>Jason_Idalski: ACHNOOR N9 ANCHOR +28 172
#note Ouch. (C)OANCHOR for 104 and my win chances are better than 50-50, even after all my screwups. (-79)
>Adam_Logan: ?FGIRTU B7 f.GFRUIT +89 312
#note Yeah, FRU(I)TInG's a lot less. My only solace was that, at dinner, Kenji and Nigel said they made their stupidest plays of the day against Adam, too. (Like he needs the help.)
>Jason_Idalski: AEIOOTV K3 O.IVE +18 190
#note Or VO(G)IE at J2. (-1)
>Adam_Logan: DEILLNS 15J DILLS +19 331
#note Welcome to spread-less Scrabble. Instead of going for another bingo (even if I should bingo, he can almost certainly outrun), Adam decides to just end the game as fast as possible.
>Jason_Idalski: AANOSTX O1 TAX +45 235
>Adam_Logan: DDENRTT F11 TREND +19 350
>Jason_Idalski: AAINOSY M2 OS. +33 268
#note Almost everything at the bottom can be killed in one fell swoop. I have to open the top half (and score). I commented that I didn't even know what I could draw to, and Adam said "NAYSAID" in about a second. Note to self (and others): Never tell Adam your racks in the post-mortem. He'll find a better play in two seconds and you'll feel like a total idiot. Anyhow, this play doesn't hemorrhage as much equity as I thought it would. (-7)
>Adam_Logan: DEOSTWZ 1K ZED +19 369
#note Again, W(I)Z sims like 30 points better, but since a win by 1 is the same as a win by 300, this is just as good. Both guaranteed wins.
>Jason_Idalski: AAEINPY A13 PAY +30 298
#note Part of me wanted to play (D)YE and fish for the blank so I could go out with jAPANI(ZED). (-7)
>Adam_Logan: ?OPSSTW L7 SWOoPS +30 399
#note POSTSh(O)W. Even Adam misses bingos. :)
>Jason_Idalski: AEIMN 14H ANIME +20 318
#note MAI(D)EN, duh. Ten more. "You didn't draw well," my annotator said. Yeah, and I played worse. I guess I should be ecstatic with a split considering I had 4/20 power tiles, but change any of my three big errors and this is likely a very different game.
>Jason_Idalski:  (T) +2 320
