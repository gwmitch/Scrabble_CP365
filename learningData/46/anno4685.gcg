>Joey: DDHISST I6 DISH +23 23
#note SIDH scores one more point in the same spot.
>Bing: ?AEEJNO 9C JOE +24 48
#note Crediting Joey with another S, JADE doesn't seem right, and also it blocks bingo lines.
>Joey: ADERSTZ D8 BORTZ +32 55
#note Probably a mistake.  I didn't like 6H ADZ because his last play indicated that he had an E.  ZEDS looks like the star play because it scores a lot and deadens the board.

>Bing: AEORUWY 13A YOW +36 162
>Joey: AEILOST 6B ISOLATED +63 136
#note This seemed like the safest bingo...
>Bing: ACEERTU G1 CURETTAGE +65 227
#note Except that it gave him this.  He told me that Jerry Lerman played it against him (with 2 blanks) at the 2005 NSC.
>Joey: BHIMNTU 1D BUTCH +45 181
#note If only I had the K instead of a B.  Mmmm...donut holes.

#note I didn't think I could escape with RIVERMEN#.

>Joey: EEGPRRR A10 PRAYER +33 255
>Bing: GIIOSWY 15G YWIS +45 342
#note YOGIS sims roughly even with this, indicating that it might be worth about 3 points to get rid of 1 more tile in this position.
>Joey: CEGKRUV C2 GUCKS +24 279
>Bing: DGIIINO 15M GOD +21 363
#note I thought I had to take out the S-hook, despite the horrible leave.
>Joey: AEELORV 3G ROVE +11 290
#note I pretty much had to play this.  Otherwise, he could totally shut down this part of the board.
>Bing: FIIIMNT 4A FICIN +28 391
#note #note This looks a little strange, quite likely giving up a bingo or a 62 point X play, but I wanted to leave 1 in the bag and keep MIFF for my next turn. I guess PIU 2E would accomplish the same thing in a safer manner.

#note LINAC or LINGA K1 are the best out-plays.
