>Chuck_Armstrong: DIILOP 8G LIPOID +22 22
>Pete: ACDEGOP L3 GOADE. +18 18
#note Duck like PAGOD L4, DECAPOD L2 and 7J GOAD.  I missed them all.    This play is a mistake, many better plays.
>Chuck_Armstrong: BEGILST K7 B.LGIEST +76 98
>Pete: CEIOPWW M2 WOW +29 47
#note I was angriest that I couldn't justify playing COWPIE.  WOW is best, despite what it potentially gives back.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DINZ 12H DIZ.N +34 132
>Pete: CEEHIPR 14F HERPE.IC +75 122
#note Only bingo.  Took forever for me to remember it.  I went through my alphagrams, and eventually, something clicked with CEEHIPRT.  Took the time to find it, and then assured myself it was good.  Also seemed to remember it not taking an S, which considering where it ends, was a good thing to know or think.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADIORTU 15A AUDITOR +84 216
#note Oh bother.  Although I immediately see some fun potential for a Y now.  This game just got very very volatile.
>Pete: AEGKQRT K3 ARK +36 158
#note I was willing to take one chance on drawing something into the Q, especially considering that I wanted to keep scoring.  Duck agrees.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEMNR C10 REMEN. +18 234
>Pete: AEGMQTV -GQV +0 158
#note My exchange reeks a bit of panic.  I mis VEG for 30, with spots to dump the Q next turn..  
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?FLNRUV N8 RETINAS +100 334
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?FLNRUV --  -100 234
#note After a bit of a think, I challenge, knowing the game's over if it's good.  Also angry knowing he'll be bingoing next turn anyways.
>Pete: AEIMNTV H3 VITAM.NE +64 222
#note Only bingo.  At least it doesn't create a new better spot than her has already for AEINRST to go down.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEINRST A8 ANTISER. +77 311
>Pete: ?ABHOQU 6F QU. +32 254
#note I love my play, duck is a bit more eh on it.  It likes QUOTH 5E, which I think kills too much of the board..  I know I need to keep opening, and with a ? and an A, it's a very dangerous spot.  I know I probably need to hit this turn, but Iquickly realize I'm not out of it, especially if Chuck catches a tough rack along the way here.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EJTU B6 JUTE +31 342
>Pete: ??ABEHO E5 HAmBOnE +103 357
#note Geez, did I catch.  I didn't see BACKHOE, and I was unsure of HAMBONE, but if there's a time to try a bingo I don't know, this seems appropriate.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ERX -  +0 342
#note Chuck challenges... naturally my first reaction is that it's no good.  When I see Zyzzyva turn green, I have to supress a feeling of shock.
>Pete: AALNOSY H12 .O.Y +60 417
#note And there's that OY combo.  Excellent timing there.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ERX D11 REX +40 382
>Pete: AALLNNS D4 LA +9 426
#note At this point, I have mistracked, and think I have the case A. Idiot.  My play sims reasonably, but ALLS and NANS, killing the S hook on DIZEN, win sim.  From this point on, I botch the game horribly.
>Chuck_Armstrong: CESU M10 CUSE. +34 416
#note I hold, but wisely don't challenge.  With what I have, and what I think I have, I think I have a win.  I do, but it's not quite what I thought.
>Pete: ALNNOSV N2 ONS +28 454
#note VAN 3C is best, winning 82%.  I thought I had the case A.  My play wins 65%.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AFFGIOT 3B FIAT +17 433
#note FA 1N is best. FIAT does set up the biggest out, and block my easiest plays.  It sort of opens the door for me to screw up...

>Pete: ALNVY 7K ..VY +16 470
#note ANY or NAVY are best.  I just wanted to make sure of the win, especially since I was pretty sure of the point total (I recounted during the game).  I did not take my time to make the best play, but it is enough.
