>Panupol: AAITW 8H AWAIT +18 18
>Joey: ACMNOOR K3 ACROMION +74 74
#note MONOCRAT is best.  Or is it?
>Panupol: AAIMSTV M3 ATAVISM +91 109
#note Of course it was.  After all, it would have prevented this bingo from scoring so much.  I couldn't figure out why he didn't play it at 11F.
>Joey: AEFOSUX 11G FOXES +56 130
#note I thought to myself "ACROMIA is no good, so this has to take an S."  Note that I didn't put an asterisk next to ACROMIA.
>Panupol: DLOORSU 9B DOLOURS +62 171
#note Good thing Panupol thought the same thing.  Maybe I should have blocked this row and let him "have" the 11E spot.
>Joey: AEEFGIU 8A FIG +27 157
#note Bad miss here.  FAUCET 4H is clearly the star play.
>Panupol: ELN J6 LEAN +16 187
>Joey: ADEEIUU 4K CUTIE +16 173
>Panupol: ?EEQRRU N9 EQUERRy +124 311
#note He took a long time before committing to this.  I wish he had tried QUEERERS*.
>Joey: ADEELTU H11 OUTED +21 194
#note TELEDU 12D is a great play in a close game or with a lead.  Not when behind by this much of a margin.
>Panupol: INTW O8 TWIN +42 353
#note Have you noticed that there have only been three moves without any commentary?  You'd think this was one of those Jason and Jason anecdota.
>Joey: ABCELLR O1 CELEB +27 221
>Panupol: DINOPRY 13A DRYPOINT +80 433
>Joey: AEKLNOR 15L KAyO +36 257
>Panupol: AEI A12 IDEA +18 451
>Joey: EIJLNPR E6 REJOIN +26 283
#note Oh great.  The bag isn't empty yet, and I know all of his letters again.
>Panupol: EEHISTV F1 THIEVES +79 530
>Joey: ?AGLOPT 3B GAlLIPOT +78 361
#note Missing the silly looking PLOTTAGE, which doesn't have the definition I expected.
>Panupol: ABDGHNY H1 AGONY +30 560
#note AHOY H1 is best.  Maybe Panupol just wanted to play a word that summed up this game.
>Joey: EZ 12L ZEE +24 385
#note At least I got through this whole game without saying "DOPS!" until now.
>Joey:  (BDH) +18 403
