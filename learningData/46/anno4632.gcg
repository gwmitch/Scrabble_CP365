#note It close between this, exch. all, and exch keeping E. 
>Reinke: AEIMRSU J7 UREMIAS +72 72
>Tran: AEEGNTW K5 WET +14 26
#note A very bad choice. I didn't know WANTAGE, but 12I W(A)GE is still way better.  (-5)
>Reinke: ADO K10 ODA +20 92

#note I6 G(U)Y  (-4)

#note VEGAN in the same spot (-2)
>Reinke: IPR 1L .RIP +21 146
>Tran: ACFNNSV -FNV +0 73
#note Q prefers playing through this; VANS VACS VAN or VAC at L8.  Given the score, I think exchanging makes more sense (-3)
>Reinke: IIIII -IIIII +0 146
>Tran: AAACNRS 9A ARCANAS +70 143
#note First of two phony bingos.  Bonus points if you can spot the real bingo. (+8)
>Reinke: ?ILNOTY A8 L.NOsITY +140 286
#note ACAR(ID)ANS.  --His only x3x3.  Perhaps Karma for phonying

#note Redemption
>Reinke: ACFLTU D4 FACTU.L +26 312
>Tran: EHIIRSZ L12 HI +22 239
#note Didnt see 12A (s)IZER.  Don't like the other choices of H11 ZI(N)ES, O1 (P)HIZ, OR 5C H(A)ZIER. (-10)
>Reinke: ETV E3 VET +21 333

#note ZOMG my first star play
>Reinke: AB 10D .AB +23 356
>Tran: DDEIRSX I3 XI +37 317
#note Frustratingly blocks the spot for (L)EX.  At least now I get to keep my E.
>Reinke: EEINT B5 ENTI.E +16 372
>Tran: DDEIORS M5 SODDIER +69 386
#note Second phony bingo of the game. Very relieved to hear him say "Nice Play" and not "Challenge."  (+28)
>Reinke: Q 9L Q. +11 383
>Tran: AHLPRSW A1 PSHAW +47 433
#note Didn't know RALPH, but PSHAW sims highest.  If I knew RALPH, I'd play it -- S's tend to be useful for the endgame.
>Reinke: BEGIKLT H12 K.IT +39 422
>Tran: ?ELOR 14K EnROL +13 446
#note Very low on time. N10 REOiL is best. (-8)
>Tran:  (BEGL) +14 460
#note I made a lot of mistakes.  But with the help of two phony bingoes, my plays are +4 equity over Quackle's suggested plays. Take that, Quackle!
