#note thats what happens when you ask to see whats in my binder cause you think i have something other than a blank scoresheet in there.
>Hans_Oh: AJNN B6 JN.NA +30 30
>Max_Karten: ELTUUVW F6 TU.U +6 72
#note i cant save UU or UW this early. its an illness. WU(D) for 7 seems obvious, but ELTUV i guess wasnt even a thought.
>Hans_Oh: EGIOOR C10 GOOIER +17 47
>Max_Karten: CDEILVW 15A WI.ED +30 102
#note CE(R)VID? gtfo. pertaining to the cervix? no. get your mind out of the gutter. W(E)EVIL for 28 leaving CD is nice. VI(E)WED leaving CL and creating two hotspots is what i would normally do but for some reason i felt like being overly defensive in this game cause ?? was already out. it was unenjoyable for me to play so abnormally for my style.
>Hans_Oh: BKO 12A BO.K +26 73
>Max_Karten: CEEELTV E4 VEE +14 116
#note debated ELECTE(D) but wanted to save one E badly for a play that put it @ E14. didnt see LEVEE(D) leaving CT, might have used the third E for that.
>Hans_Oh: EFL D5 FLE. +16 89
#note he took a while to do this, i knew his rack was not left in a good way
>Max_Karten: CEILMTZ 14C .MIC +21 137
>Hans_Oh: IIIII -IIIII +0 89
>Max_Karten: EELNRTZ G7 T.N +10 147
#note plays like (Z)AG for 13 i conditioned myself to never do to the point that when its right i cant do it.
>Hans_Oh: AP H6 PA. +7 96
>Max_Karten: DEEELRZ 6H .EELED +11 158
#note i liked that he couldnt play a 7 ending in S and wanted to keep it that way with SSSS out so that eliminated DELE, DEER, and DREE G10. wish i had remembered DERES* but probably wouldve balked even if i did. (B)LE(W) ruins my H(EMIC) setup. (I)DLE E8 is sweet, totally didnt see it.
>Hans_Oh: AIRWX L2 WAXI.R +32 128
>Max_Karten: HOQRSYZ 3L .ZO +24 182
#note wanted to use either Z or Q and keep H. this is the only one of the 10 generated choices that does that.
>Hans_Oh: COY E10 COY +30 158
#note stfu.
>Max_Karten: EHQRSUY 14B H.... +34 216
#note pretended to be real unsure of this while i played it, he held but no chall despite me acting pissed at myself like it was coming off while he held it. dont judge me.
>Hans_Oh: GGORR J2 GORG.R +12 170
>Max_Karten: EQRSTUY 10G TREY +18 234
#note sometimes... not often... i make good plays/ plays that im satisfied with even after review. this is one of those times.

>Max_Karten: AAAISTV N8 VISA +26 295
#note how is blocking (AZO)N 7s and making it so he has to bingo either to the G in GORGER or making (EQUAL)S, both opeing an easy parallel to the top or bottom row, wrong? VISTA puts me up by 107 but if he bingoes for 90 and i draw into uselessness cause i saved AA im effed. AVAST and VASA both leave it open for (AZO)N 7s, i like my play which is simming 4th on 4 ply after 600 iterations (or VASA int he same spot).

#note is this really that bad?

#note scored this as 32, i think one of the letters might have already been there, not sure how, its possible i misscored that badly but unlikely.
