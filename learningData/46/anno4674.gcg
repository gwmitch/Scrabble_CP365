#note this was the first game of the day. while i played matt at table 2 she was sitting at table 1 and cheryl allen-munley came over to talk to her and she said "have you played him yet?" pointing to my empty seat on the other side of the table. jane said "no..." as she kind of shook her head and grimaced and then said "he must be ::inaudible" and cheryl responded "yeah thats what i figured, he must be" at which point i said "you know i can hear you, right?" we all laughed. good times. now lets do this connecticut!

#note she took a good 4 minutes to play this, i thought she was taking so long cause she had nothing. guess i was wrong. sad face? you know it. i told after the game this was gorgeous, which it is.

#note NI(A)CIN and ANO(D)IC? gtfo quackle. i dont see how (I)ONIC leaving AAN is so strong in sim.
>Jane_Clark: ADIOU 10J AUDIO +13 172
>Max_Karten: AEIORTV 13D .EVIATOR +64 184
#note AUDIO played in 13 in both spots, pretty sweet she choose the one that still let me bingo.
>Jane_Clark: AKO 12K OAK +16 188
>Max_Karten: EEILMPY M9 M.L.Y +34 218
#note took a good 3-4 minutes on this play. didnt know what to do at all, so many 28-36 pt choices. LIMEY 4J is nice, dont remember if i saw it. I was strongly considering YELP 4L which sims best next. YIPE in the same spot  is after that which is way too dangerous for me.
>Jane_Clark: ?AEFINT O5 FAINEsT +83 271
#note lame.
>Max_Karten: EEEIPPX 14J PEE +24 242
#note i figured i had to get crazy, and she has a totally new rack so maybe I can really take advantage here over the course of two or three plays. EP(O)PEE saving XI is best but that would require knowing the word EPOPEE.

#note this MIGHT work. leave OP open! leave OP open!

>Max_Karten: EEINPRS 4C REPINES +76 356
#note good thing she knew REPINES! dont judge me. she may have even said "yup. i couldnt block both spots." i told her after "im not sure if SCOR is good..." and she said "oh it definitely is" then went in her bag and got her franklin, typed it in, and goes "S*$T! it isnt good! SCOT is good!" oh scrabble, you amuse me.
