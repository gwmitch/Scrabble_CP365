#description Jason Idalski plays Evan Berofsky in Round 9 at the 2009 CanAm
>Jason_Idalski: AAEFMSV 8G FAVA +20 20
>Evan_Berofsky: ?IIUWXZ 7F WIZ +33 33
#note Considering that the first tile Evan looked at was the blank, this is a pretty crappy rack. :)
>Jason_Idalski: ?DEEMNS K8 SiDEMEN +79 99
#note Thirteen 79-pointers. Duck likes DEMESNE at K4. (-2)
>Evan_Berofsky: ?IIIUVX L11 XI +35 68
#note As we entered the game into Quackle, I joked that Evan was so close to LIXIVIA, which is apparently a plural of the missed bingo. Hard to fault Evan for missing it, though; would've been an incredible find.
>Jason_Idalski: EIIKOST J6 KO. +17 116
#note EIKON's and KOINE's anagram escaped me. Too bad, because it's the best play by far. (-9)
>Evan_Berofsky: ?IIRTUV K4 TUI +12 80
>Jason_Idalski: EIIMNST 4H MIN.IEST +78 194
>Evan_Berofsky: ?ILRSTV 11J V.. +13 93
>Jason_Idalski: AAEHIPR 3L AHI +26 220
#note After that fish, blocking trip-trips is necessary. EPHA at 3K does that better, though. (-6)
>Evan_Berofsky: ?BILRST 3C BRISToL +76 169
#note Evan saw the 93-pointer shortly after hitting his clock.
>Jason_Idalski: AADENPR O4 .APED +24 244
#note Duck likes PA, 2N. Not a fan of fishing here, but maybe it's better. (-6)
>Evan_Berofsky: EOORRSY N6 OYER +23 192
>Jason_Idalski: ABEGJNR M6 BAG +26 270
#note Close. Add an R before BAG and an E after. Didn't know HERBAGE. (-10)
>Evan_Berofsky: AIOOORS J10 O.A +18 210
>Jason_Idalski: EJLNRRT M11 TERN +28 298
#note Glad I didn't just settle for J(I)LT. Clearly best.
>Evan_Berofsky: FIOORSY H1 RO..Y +27 237
>Jason_Idalski: HJLOPRW 5D JOWL. +36 334
#note Took me way too long to see, considering it's the only play.
>Evan_Berofsky: DFINORS 9E DIF +24 261
>Jason_Idalski: EHLOPRU 8A OUPHE +45 379
#note This setup is the kind of stuff that was happening during my lucky streak that allowed me to get here. I like cooperative opponents.
>Evan_Berofsky: CGNORSU C8 .ROGUN +20 281
>Jason_Idalski: EGLNRTU 15L GELT +26 405
#note Or GENU. I was keeping the U for Q insurance, but on this board it's not really necessary. (-2)
>Evan_Berofsky: AACEOST 4A TOEA +34 315
>Jason_Idalski: AEINQRU A1 QUA.E +42 447
#note Or QUI(T). Knew the game was won with anything I put in that spot, so I took the first thing I saw. (-25)
>Evan_Berofsky: ACCEELS A7 C.ALESCE +63 378
#note Nice fairly routine win to start Sunday off.
>Evan_Berofsky:  (DINNR) +12 390
