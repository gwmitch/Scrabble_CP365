#note Maybe better to keep it simple with APEX. Dunno.

#note OAKIE(R) is an interesting option.

#note Yuck. Didn't know what to do. This is an attempt to block the board. I didn't think he'd go for NOTETAK(E) either. Unfortnately, I have KENO here, for a better leave.

#note This was an interesting decision. I didn't think about VOLTS, just this and Q(A)T. The nice thing about QAT is that it helps block the new lanes. But on the other hand, it keeps a dismal leave, especially for this board.

>Noah: EGLORST C9 GLO.E +20 227
#note LOG looks best. This isn't very good I don't think.
>Mike_Baker: ABEEERV 3D BEAVERE. +69 296
#note BEREAVE(R) may be better, I probably would challenge too.

>Noah: ?DNNNRW 8L .WN +6 269
#note I think I need to play this. I have to set up something good, because blocking won't be too hard. There's not that much hope left, unfortunately.
>Mike_Baker: AEOZ N6 ZO.E +33 353
#note He told me he had the A here.
>Noah: ?DINNRU 11B N. +2 271
#note I don't think I can win after INTURNeD. Quackle likes UN(B)R(E)D and UN(ZONE)D. I played this to fish for DURIANs or something over here. How does UNBRED win 25% of the time?
