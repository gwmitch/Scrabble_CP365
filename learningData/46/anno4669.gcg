#note OK, maybe I was getting a bit cocky here.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
#note Chuck exchanges 7.

>Pete: CENNORY 8H CORNY +28 28
#note CRONY is better by a hair.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEG 7I GEE +15 15
>Pete: ADEFNOT 6I AFT +35 63
#note Best.  Scores, and sets up 2 D hooks while I've got one.
>Chuck_Armstrong: FO J4 OF... +11 26
>Pete: DENOOVY H8 .ONVOYED +104 167
#note This one took me a good five minutes to find, and another to get the guts to play it.  With a rack this ugly, losing a challenge was a frightening proposition.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEEIRST -  +0 26
#note Chuck challenges.  When it comes back good, I'm surprised again.  I'm not used to winning challeneges against the Chuck Armstrongs of the world.
>Pete: ADEHNRT 14G N.ATHERD +78 245
#note And what a timely occasion to draw an easy bingo rack.  Best, putting me at 99.65% to win with 73 unseen tiles.  Thank you bag.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEEIRST O9 AERIEST +87 113
#note Oh well, I knew it couldn't all go my way.  
>Pete: ADLMNOZ H1 ALMOND +38 283
#note I miss ZOONAL, which is a real nice play.  I like ALMOND tho.  I'm not particularly scared about the board being open, and with the Z, I feel like I'll score soon.  It's nice to have a big lead, and since I still do need to make up a good bit of spread, it seems an opportune time to go for it.

#note When it rains...
>Chuck_Armstrong: AAGIN 3H .AGIAN +33 172
#note very nice play by Chuck.
>Pete: ABINRSV L1 BR.VA +26 369
#note BRAVA over BRAVI is a brainfart, pure and simple.  case A is very valuable on this board, with the potential for nice scores on row 4 and column N.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEKP 4B PEEK +37 209
>Pete: ?EHIINS 15A fINISHE. +88 457
#note So my reward is another easy rack. The win % finally hits 100.  FINISHED is the best of the bunch.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ILM 14B MIL +22 231
>Pete: ?EGLORW N10 WO +28 485
#note Wow, this game isn't fair.  I miss the the Kickass LEGWORkS/(MIL)k, but kill another line, and draw at a strong leave.  I like WO better than LOWERING/ ROWELING, which I did consider.  WEBLOG is also a strong play, that I totally missed.
>Chuck_Armstrong: UUUU -UUUU +0 231
>Pete: ?EGJLRT C13 J.. +20 505
#note So i miss my fish.  Try Try again.  Duck likes JOG 9G, I wanted to keep the line open.  
>Chuck_Armstrong: DIU 12C DUI +20 251
>Pete: ?EGLRTW E11 W.LT. +22 527
#note I chickened out on WERGELT.  Missed WATERLOG, and TWANGLER.  I suck. Fore some reason, I decide now is the time to play defense.  WILTS is the best nonbingo.
>Chuck_Armstrong: OSUU K6 ...UOUS +14 265
#note and this sums up the kind of racks Chuck was playing through.
>Pete: ?EEGIIR E2 .I.IE +22 549
#note BIKER is best.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ELQSTTU 7B QUEST +27 292
#note SUQ 7E is best

>Pete: ?CEGR 9D pREC.G +21 570
>Pete: ?CEGR --  -21 549
#note No outs. I try to create one.  Oh well.
