#note I could have played this in the other spot for one more point, but this spot was much better defensively.
>Rod: ?EFORRW 11D FOREWARn +102 102
#note So much for that logic.  That's as fast as a 96-0 lead can disappear.

#note I was just about to settle on ZOOEY, then realized at the last minute I could score one more point with this and save my E.
>Rod: ADENRTU G1 UNTREAD +77 200
#note Had I settled on ZOOEY, he would have been forced to find UNDERRATE, which I'm sure he would have, based on what he found later on.
>Joey: AEIPSSS 1D ISSUE +18 170
#note Missing PASTISES!  Once I didn't find any bingos, I spent another three minutes just trying to figure out what the hell to PLAY.  (G.I. Joel tone used here)
>Rod: ?BMNOOO 3C BOOMTOwN +72 272
#note Awesome bingo!  But GOMBROON scores two more points, which may be critical.  And of course, PASTISES would have blocked both bingos.
>Joey: AILPSVX 4B PAX +46 216
#note I guess no mistake is going unpunished, since GOMBROON wouldn't have allowed any big X plays.

#note I was very lucky with this final draw, especially the case T.  This play seemed to win by at least a few points, until Rod found...

#note Whoa!
>Joey: AEM 6A MAE +21 435
#note And the recount held up, which now makes me 11.5-8.5 in tournament games decided by 1 point or less.  What a crazy game!
