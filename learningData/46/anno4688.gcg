>Chris_Sykes: DILOOUV 8D VODOU +26 26
>Jason_Idalski: ADEGLMO E5 GLO.MED +44 44
#note When he held, I wasn't sure if I wanted a challenge or not. But it is good.
>Chris_Sykes: AIILNOU I7 UNAI +16 42
>Jason_Idalski: AAELORR H10 AREOLA +23 67
#note Didn't see the cute AR(D)OR at F6. (-4)
>Chris_Sykes: AEEIILO 6B AIO.I +9 51
#note Now it's Chris' turn to miss that spot. AE(D)ILE.
>Jason_Idalski: AACGKNR D10 RACK +25 92
#note Vowels are already becoming scarce, a fact I will soon prove by my drawing. "Nice RACK," Chris commented. (rimshot)
>Chris_Sykes: DEEELOV F10 VOLE +33 84
>Jason_Idalski: AFGLNRW I13 FAG +25 117
#note WRANG, J9. This minor mistake will prove my game-losing play. (-4)
>Chris_Sykes: DEEENNT B4 NE.TENED +61 145
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason_Idalski: CLMNRWX J5 CWM +22 139
#note The always-exciting "let's hope he's drawn crap and leaves it open" play.
>Chris_Sykes: ?BHOQST A8 HOB +45 190
#note Ooh, not so much. And as you can see, he's not exactly sacrificing leave either.
>Jason_Idalski: ILNORTX A1 TOXIN +44 183
#note All 10 power tiles unplayed ... what's the name of the game? Turnover!
>Chris_Sykes: ?BEEQST J14 BE +25 215
>Jason_Idalski: AHLRRTT 5G LAR.H +20 203
#note Or RAT(C)H. THR(U) is intriguing, too. (-3)
>Chris_Sykes: ?EQSSTT H4 Q.T +22 237
>Jason_Idalski: IPRRTTU J9 TRIP +15 218
#note This is really getting frustrating. Like my game with Keller at Nats ... 2/3 of the way through and ??SSSS still unplayed/unseen. I decide to kill the easy bingo lane. Duck prefers TUR(K), which I almost played, or PUTTI at K7. Looked for a five starting in P ... I have such a block against that word.
>Chris_Sykes: ?EJSSTZ 14B JESTS +49 286
#note Although now I see why my turnover wasn't netting anything.
>Jason_Idalski: ?EIRSTU 1A .RUSTIEr +74 292
>Chris_Sykes: ?EFINNZ K11 FEZ +44 330
#note According to Speedy, six consecutive perfect turns from Chris.
>Jason_Idalski: AEIPRSY L12 PAY +41 333
#note Still hope. Duck says I'm slightly less than 50-50, but doesn't take into account how long Chris has been grooming his rack.
>Chris_Sykes: ?ADINNW M13 sAW +37 367
#note CP doesn't like, unless it's too far off Speedy's radar. A(H) wins 8/9 and ties a ninth; I see why. But over the board, I figured he'd play this and I'd be sunk. I'd have done the same, FWIW.
>Jason_Idalski: EEGIIRS 15L S.IG +37 370
#note Burned way too much energy here ... tried to find a play using EEIR to leave this open; his best blocking play is WIN and I can stick him with DNUY. Then I noticed his best play there is (W)YN. Duh.
>Chris_Sykes: DINNUY 6J .INDY +25 392
#note Oh, I gave him UNDYIN(G). Smart of me to not notice until now.
>Jason_Idalski: EEIR N5 E.RIE +8 378
#note 15.7 equity lost; from that standpoint, best-played game of the year. 52.1 total lost for the match. Given that, a little disappointing to "only" come away with a split. One chance left to get that elusive sweep.
>Jason_Idalski:  (NU) +4 382
