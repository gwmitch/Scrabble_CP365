#note I missed the star play here.
>Bob: ABIY 2B BIA.Y +36 183
>Dave: AGIINNX 1F AXING +44 239
#note I did not miss AX F5 here, but I decided taking out the triple and getting rid of the duplicates was worth the eight point sacrifice.  I might bingo with GIINN on this board, but when I don't I'm likely to have to make a low scoring fish.
>Bob: ELW D1 W.LE +27 210
>Dave: AEIINOV 2J OVINE +25 264
#note I spent several turns looking for plays on the L column, but I missed the very nice EIKON here.
>Bob: EFLORZ D8 F.OZLER +55 265
>Dave: ACEILUV 14A ACE.VULI +80 344
#note I should have remembered the bingo this rack makes with an S.  And finding that might have led me to the bingo I *really* should have played.  Dammit.

>Bob: DJOY 6B JOY.D +36 459
#note I was very disappointed here that neither DAMNDESTs nor DAMNeDEST fit, but I already missed my chance in that lane.
>Dave: ?ADDMNT 11B DA.eD +30 455
#note We both missed his out-play here, but I can't win anyway.
>Bob: AEGIU I5 GAI. +16 475
>Dave: MNT C13 M.T +18 473
#note DENT only encourages him to play EQUIP, which he should have done anyway.
>Bob: EU M7 U.E +5 480
#note EQUIP would have led to a 491-479 victory for Bob and my highest loss ever.
