#note i liked how the the LI was his only lane because I figured I would have a big enough comeback play along the O lane to take the game, but something like HOM(I)NG N9 i guess works for the points and has the same effect, but it leaves the P open at A1 for him to score with a bingo that leaves me no response

>Max_Karten: BFGMNOW 10L WOG +18 353
#note plays that are simming above this either dont block the LI, create a new lane (-IN(G) is pretty dismal looking at the pool) or are just like WOG but have a hook other than S except FOB, MOB, and M(E)OW K6. i liked BFM over GW but i suppose in this situation thats not right based on the spots to score (i was concerned with just blocking his lanes and keeping a big enough lead), but i dont understand how the plays other than FOB, MOB, and M(E)OW sim higher.

#note the ten choices quackle suggests all win 100%, this wins only about 87%, a fitting end to a very poorly played tournament. however, i dont see how this ever loses, maybe a longer bingo that i dont know or they think he can score enough somehow, im not sure. i also remember being almost positive the Z is what was in the bag, i dont remember why i thought that though. my other choice that i considered is on quackles list (EF B9) but i feared some type of play played REF cause i was very nervous and paranoid at this point. i was positive he didnt have an -IN(G) bingo with the given pool and i was right, there are no 8 letter words with that pool + G (or 8 letter words with that pool + the U @ H11). so yeah, i dont how or when this ever loses.
