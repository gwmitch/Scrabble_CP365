#note with the board so open I couldnt close it, so i figured id score and leave myself CV to score again next play and still be winning even under the worst scenarios.
>Brian_Miller: GIILPRS 3F PILGRI.S +76 276
#note damnit. this is how the way i play gets me in trouble.
>Max_Karten: CEEHRSV B2 HERVES +30 316
#note even if this wasnt phony its a terrible play. my reasoning was I couldnt really use the L so i created a second spot to easily score touching a TWS. wtf is CHEVRES?
>Brian_Miller: IMX C1 MIX +47 323
#note damnit again.
>Max_Karten: BCERRTU 5K B.UR +12 328
#note normally i like CU(L)T but i didnt anticipate that ending up well with BERR leave and a 14 point lead. i did this so there was an additional spot to score that couldnt be closed by using the TWS with the M in MIX or the L in PILGRIMS while leaving myself a good chance at bingoing making (KIS)T which i assumed he had totally forgotten about. quackle doesnt hate this but says im giving up about 10% to CU(L)T. it also says RUB, CUB, TUB 2E are all better but with OOO out theres no way im doing that.

>Max_Karten: CEILORT O1 CITER +31 359
#note pretend i played RECIT or pretend BLUR takes an R, i dont care which. gave up on bingoing with (KIS)T only because i couldnt figure out a play in this spot that didnt use T. i thought i was gonna draw another one, just probably not gonna bingo with it. i thought the only reason this won was because it left one in the bag and it was the Q and he assumed it was on my rack but quackle says it wins 55% of the time on a 4 ply sim so maybe there are other ways this wins too. i wasnt too confident what was gonna happen after he played Q(I) or blocked me from doing it though...
>Brian_Miller: EINORTU 1J EROTI. +9 359
#note i knew when he didnt play Q(I) immediately its what was in the bag. i thought this was just awesome.
>Max_Karten: FGLOTUV 14L L... +5 364
#note didnt consider not playing this after I saw it was his only spot, but there are some generated plays that win and probably some others quackle didnt think of too. GUV G12, (A)LOFT J11, TOFU 14E and O(A)F G5.
