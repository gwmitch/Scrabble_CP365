#note Interesting. Quackle sims three plays better: c5 OW, 12C WORDILY, and C5 DOW. OW and DOW are interesting since I'm guessing they keep the Y to score next turn, with an easy YA or DRILY. WORDILY makes sense. I think I miscounted that as 26 when I was considering it. Stupid.

#note Didn't see the spiffy 6G LARINE or the straightforward 8K URIAL (even though I looked for a play there). IZAR is behind those two.

#note Top-simming play is 3K VID??? This confuses me. However, there are a ton of A's and E's left which gives me a good shot at CHARTED/RETCHED. On a better day, I would consider such a ballsy play. DITCH was the other play I was considering. Again, on a better day, I would put the H in a triple lane. Sim details shows VID not giving me a huge chance to bingo, so the really advantage is just keeping a synergistic leave which can score next turn and bingo the turn after that. DRV is a lot more workable than DTV, so that exlains the chasm between DITCH and CHARD.
