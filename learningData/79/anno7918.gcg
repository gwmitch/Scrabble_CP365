#note Awful play. This is going to give back 70+ most of the time. KN(BY)OB is 51 points and doesn't give back so much.
>semihobo: AEGIMST 1A STEMGAI +131 309
>TheLamb: ?BHINST L7 THISBaN +99 286
#note Missed the B and H hooks to STEMGAI, which make passing up the bingo easy.

#note Setting up UAQTANIT with a billion I's in the bag. Have to hope Chris doesn't see it.
>semihobo: ?ADOORT C7 .ARODOTn +72 483
>TheLamb: AEINRRR 8A ER.R +26 412
#note This is probably really weak. I couldn't find anything hitting UAQTANIT and getting rid of two R's. I can't really afford to score so low at this point.

>TheLamb: AEIILNR 15F RNILAIE +95 507
#note Could have played for more overlaps, but I wanted to leave UAQTANIT open, since I knew I would need those points next turn. Unfortunately, there is no way to bingo sticking an E under the T, setting up UAQTANITE.
