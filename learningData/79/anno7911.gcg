>quackle: EEFKRRT 8G KERF +22 22
#note KERF is the correct play, keeping the excellentERT leave, scoring 22 points, and not leaving a whole lot for your opponentnext turn.  While you could considerplaying KERF at 8e since it is more defensive (it induces more right angles and thus increases the size of the closed quadrant), closing the board is not agood idea against a random rack with an ERT leave unless you believe your opponentto be very bad at closed boards.
>Kenji: EEILLTV 9F VILE +21 21
#note VILE is the correct play, scoring 21 points and possessing good scoring defense.  While this boardhas some bingo potential, without a bingo it is very difficult to score.   If youbelieved that your opponent was inept at closed boards, you might considertrying KEVIL instead.  However, the V atf9 does a good job at closing the bottom left quadrant, even though it leavesthe top left quadrant open with the S-KI hook. 
>quackle: DEEIQRT -Q +0 22
#note Exchanging is best since there are no good plays and it is not worth keeping a Q and exchanging good tiles for very few points. Exchanging EQ, IQ, or Q are all both reasonable plays, although exchange EQ seems best.
>Kenji: EELNSTV K8 SVELTE +30 51
#note SVELTE is an overreaction to the exchange.  While you do want to block the bingopossibilities on lines 10 and K as your opponent has shown an extremely strongrack from an exchange 1, you are not likely to be successful as SVELTE opens upan R hook and an open E and T to bingo through, as well as the S hook onSKI.  It is best to play LEV, and try andget your own bingo.  While SVELTE isthematically what you would like to try and do against an exchange 1, it justgives up too many points and your leave is strong enough to fish yourself.  After this position, we havecreated a right angle closing the top right quadrant.  A play like VETS would not be effective sinceline 10 could still be used to open the bottom left quadrant.  Since the bottom of the board was moreaccessible before the play, it is better to make the bottom of the boardaccessible by playing SVELTE instead of making the top of the board accessibleby playing VETS.
>quackle: DEEIORT L10 RIOTED +28 50
#note While DOE is also a reasonable play, there is not potentialfor EIRT on this board, making RIOTED a stronger play.  RIOTED limits your ability to score whileturning over tiles hoping for an S or a blank.
>Kenji: CEHIMNO 15G CHIME. +42 93
#note CHIMED, MICHED, and OHM are all good plays andsim virtually identically.  CHIMED hasthe benefit of essentially closing the lower left quadrant.
>quackle: AAEINSU 14H EAU +18 68
#note EAU is best, scoring 18 points and keeping a strong leave.  No other play even compares in terms of equity.  If line M were unavailable, NAUSEA 7d might be worth considering since you are behind andneed to open the top of the board, but the position is not dire enough to makethat play yet.
>Kenji: ABEGNNO M9 GENOA +31 124
#note Diagram 8:  Best, as all other options such as BEAN m11 leave open an S hook that is difficult to block.  Finding a high scoring play along line M that doesn't leave an S hook is quite lucky indeed.  While there is an S hook at 7a,it opens a triple word lane, and can be closed in the next few turns.  Now there are no options for a bingo besides the S-KI hook.
>quackle: AGINRSY 13C GRAINY +31 99
#note GRAINY is best. Fishing this turn with GYRE, YEH, or LINY wont work, as your opponent can just block line 7, leaving you nowhere to play your bingo.
>Kenji: ?ABNTWW D12 B.AW +26 150
#note Best.
>quackle: DEIIRSX 12F XI +20 119
#note Best.  While IXIA appears to open a line, its effect is the exact opposite: making it possible for your opponent to block down all of your available lines.  Plays down column D block down both line D andthe SKI hook that you desperately need to bingo.  As it stands, blocking line 7 is difficult and plays that do so wont score well.
>Kenji: ?HNPTWZ H6 WH..P +13 163
#note Best.  Blocks the S-KI hook.
>quackle: ADEIORS 12C A. +7 126
#note A difficult play.  AB 12c opens another line, and although it will almost certainly be blocked, you can draw a bingo with any C, E, O, R, or T.  While that doesn't constitute that much of the bag, it is the best of a bad lot.
>Kenji: ?ENOTTZ C11 Z.. +13 176
#note While you can play ZOA and likely bingo next turn, you are still better off preventing both of you from playing a bingo.  The position is too good to trade bingos.
>quackle: DEIOORS 6H .OODSIER +66 192
#note Best.
>Kenji: ?ENOQTT O1 QuOTE. +45 221
#note Wow, has the tide ever changed.  This play exhibits scoring defense, as leaving open the Q at l1 and the R at o6 are too dangerous; thus, it is worth sacrificing the three points.
>quackle: ?AENORU 4H AERONaU. +66 258
#note The only bingo.
>Kenji: AILNRST 12K ...L +4 225
#note This play is quite complex.  LAB 12b is not an option because of the potential B, F, and S hooks at a12.  While TAB 12b is an option, the AILNRS leave does not bingo often enough, and the lane could either be blocked next turn (with plays like FEZ 11a) or the turn after (when your opponent uses 15a)    In this position, you wouldn't opponent to use the S in line O so that you can play TAB 12a next turn, hopefully with a good leave to play a bingo the turn after.  TRAWL scores too little, as your opponent can easily score well on line 3 next turn and your S has no good spot unless you draw the other S and can then use the 12b setup.
>quackle: IJNOPTU H1 PUJ. +39 297
#note Obviously best.  You're better off trying to outrun, as no blocking play scores enough.  Using line O for a bingo is difficult, and line 3 isn't that much worse of a bingo line for your opponent.
>Kenji: AAINRST O8 ARTISAN +80 305
#note A lucky draw.
>quackle: CINOSTU 15N US +30 327
#note While CAB sets up the case S, the INOSTU leave is unlikely to bingo next turn, or the turn after, and you will need to bingo since you will be behind next turn (after line 3 or line 15 plays).  By playing US you take a 22 point lead with a CINOT leave and don't have to take the big risk of trying to hit a bingo.
>Kenji: BDILNOT 15A BLO.N +30 335
#note Seems best.  We need both vowels and scoring tiles to win this endgame, so getting rid of the N for three extra points is correct.
>quackle: ACDINOT 2D NOCT.ID +20 347
#note Since your opponent has the higher scoring tiles, it makes sense that we need to stop him from scoring and go out quickly.  Plays in the top right corner are difficult to stop, so NOCTUID does a good job going out next turn.  By running the endgame, we can see that it wins with 6 out of 8 tiles, losing to only the G and T, both tiles that could have been in the opponent's rack last turn (whereas the F yields FLOWN and the Y yields BLOWY; thus, those must've been in the bag)
>Kenji: DEFIMTY E1 M.DIFY +30 365
#note Best, and the only winning play.
>quackle: AG F6 AG +12 359
#note This ends a complex, informative game.
>quackle:  (ET) +4 363
