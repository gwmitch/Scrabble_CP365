#note this is a tough move. it's better to play it long like D1 UNREEL, C1 EUGENOL or G8 TOLUENE. i didn't think of any of those. -2.5

#note i was sure i missd something here, guess not. i think i ended almost every game with like 2 seconds on my clock. quackle likes 2M GAE best, i don't understand completely either. 6B WEE is second, i strongly considered it, maybe it is worth the shot. -3.5

#note ok i drew the X, the Z and the S, how do i screw it up?  I7 BOZO is beautiful and i never think of crap like that. ARGH. but BOX in the same spot is only slightly less bad. i should probably take it. -4.5

#note WHAT. DID I SERIOUSLY BLOW THIS WIN AND PLAY THE ENDGAME BACKWARDS? NO! FIND THE BEST ENDGAME PLAY! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE LIKE A MINUTE TO FIGURE IT OUT.
