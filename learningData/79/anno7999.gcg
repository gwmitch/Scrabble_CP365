>Verbie: AEHKNTW H4 KNAWE +34 34
#note I saw THANK H8, but not TWEAK.  Either way, I didn't feel like handing a TWS opportunity for an ING or ERS. (-1, protested due to defensive considerations)
>Dean_Saldanha: IQ I3 QI +27 27
>Verbie: AHHOTTY J4 THY +24 58
#note I wasn't jazzed about leaving both Ts with AHOY G5.  Why I decided the AO combination was any less scary given my history with it... (-2)
>Dean_Saldanha: BENO G5 EBON +21 48
>Verbie: AGHIMOT K3 OHM +41 99
#note Tempting the fates is right here, although I would have sacrificed with THIO had I seen it (and it would be a sacrifice, by 1)
>Dean_Saldanha: AEX L2 AXE +53 101
#note ow ow o wow
>Verbie: AFGIITU F2 GIFT +15 114
#note Blech.  TUFA F3 scores enough to overcome the II in the leave. (-13.5)  Even GUINEA 8D is decent.
>Dean_Saldanha: ACIL F7 LAIC +21 122
>Verbie: AEIMSTU E7 AM +17 131
#note ouch.  AUTECISM.  (-40)
>Dean_Saldanha: CG 3E C.G +8 130
>Verbie: AEISTUV E1 VA. +11 142
#note M4 SUAVE is the star here (-5)
>Dean_Saldanha: EEERRST 11F STEERER +71 201
#note Dean sacrifices 1 point to see if I might misread LAIC as an adjective (vs 9H or M4)
>Verbie: EFISTUY M1 FEY +46 188
#note I have other fish to fry though
>Dean_Saldanha: DOOW 10H WOOD +24 225
>Verbie: IIOSTUU 1M .OU +18 206
#note Just beats out changes down to IST (by .4) or ST (by .8)
>Dean_Saldanha: EN 10H ....EN +12 237
>Verbie: IIORSTU 9M OI +6 212
#note (-2.5) to UTERI L8.  I saw TUI G11 for 4, which was #1B by Q's figuring.
>Dean_Saldanha: AI 8N AI +8 245
#note YOU've got vowels?
>Verbie: EIORSTU 7L OUR +7 219
#note If I'm going to kick out the OU, better to punt them rather than lose the R. TUI is best of a bad lot (-6.6)
>Dean_Saldanha: DIU 8J DUI +8 253
#note What is going on here?
>Verbie: BEINRST 12J BENT +27 246
#note Should have seen WEBERS H10 42.  But the best option is to stick the B at 6I! (-8)
>Dean_Saldanha: ?ADIINS 13D DIAzINS +64 317
#note AmIDINS here for 2 more, or AvIDINS for challenge bait
>Verbie: EIORSTT 12C ROT +14 260
#note Right idea, but weak execution (-8 to TO here)
>Dean_Saldanha: ADGJPPV -JVPPG +0 317
#note Total guess as to what the 5 being exchanged were
>Verbie: ?AEEIST 14B ETESIAn +79 339
#note Trick shot!
>Dean_Saldanha: ADELLRZ 2D Z.. +13 330
>Verbie: DELLPRS 15H SPELL +30 369
#note What kind of bingo is Q fearing here?  (favors not clearing with LODE D11 by 5.5)
>Dean_Saldanha: AJLNRUV M12 .AJ +20 350
#note A rare endgame clatter by Dean.  6B JARL scores 32, plays two more letters.  -17.
>Verbie: DGPR E6 G..P +13 382
#note Took me a while to come up with a way to hand myself an out-play.
>Dean_Saldanha: LNRUV B13 R.V +6 356
#note why not JUN 14M once you set it up?
>Verbie: DR O1 .RD +4 386
