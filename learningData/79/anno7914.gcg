#note Even though this is an intentional phoney that worked, I think that unless I was positive this was getting by that I should've played OEUVRE.  This isn't that much better than OEUVRE anyway, and the game is basically over if this comes off.

#note VAV is better because it keeps a better leave and moves less tiles in my quest to hit a miracle.

#note I need to score, and I hope that either Sam or I can hook JOWARI# next turn and either give me much needed points, or better yet, a free turn.

#note Pretty much a steam play, realizing that I am dead and am going to be 7-8.  Even my odds of cashing are slipping away.  No idea as to the rest of the game.
