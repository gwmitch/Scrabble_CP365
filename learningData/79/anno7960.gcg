>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGINO -AIO +0 0
#note EGIN is probably better, but I wanted to try to get away from overvaluing Is.  Q says 8F AGIO 10.  My exchange is way down the list.
>David_Gibson: ?BIPRTY 8F PRoBITY +84 84
#note I should really look at my history and see just how many times he's opened with a bingo, blank or otherwise.  Crazy.  Of note: BIPaRTY.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGLNUU 9A UNGULAE +68 68
#note Also, UNGULA(T)E.  Probably safer in hindsight, but after being so bummed at the two Us, I put this down as fast as I could.  (Gibson likes to try to get opponents in time trouble if he can.  He's surprisingly fast for someone so laid back.)
>David_Gibson: HOY -  +0 84
#note Lost challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHINORU 10D NOH +34 102
#note OHIA 10E 36. Bleh.
>David_Gibson: HOY A7 YO. +18 102
#note He told me he had HOY ready to go.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIORU -AIIOU +0 102
#note OURIE is an option, though not an amazing one.

>Ryan_Fischer: CEJNORT B6 JO +30 132
#note J(UN)CO totally slipped my brain once he blocked (I)NJECTOR.

#note D8 C(UN)NER 22, D8 R(UN)NER 14.  Bleh.

>Ryan_Fischer: EEGNORT C2 GENRO +21 153
#note L3 GREEN(Y) 33, L4 TEEN(Y) 29, 7E TOE 17.  This play isn't that great.
>David_Gibson: ?AEEINT 11G ETEsIAN +69 206
#note Of note: D7 EN(UN)cIATE 70, 5C (R)EsINATE(D) 68, 5C (R)EpAINTE(D) 68, 5C (R)ETrAINE(D) 68.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFNSSTT L10 F.ST +14 167
#note D8 F(UN)NEST 28, D8 F(UN)EST (!) 26 -- that's not a typo!  Means portending death or evil.  I wish to fork the board.

#note (!)  I think he's great because even as I put this down he said "excellent play," even though he prolly knew then that I'd eke it out.  He asked me if I saw the possibility and I said, well, I saw the possible extensions (some of them), but didn't fully realize it until it materialized on my rack.  I didn't play perfectly, and was still able to salvage it, even though he got both blanks.  I hope this is encouraging to others, especially considering how he tore it up those other 14 games, and has had such long winning streaks -- what was this most recent one?  29?
>David_Gibson: AEV C13 AVE +16 388
#note Oh wow, he missed the UNCUT(E) hook.  That might've changed things a tiny bit.
>Ryan_Fischer: AELRRTU 15A UR.AL +18 419
#note 6E RULER 17 is champ's choice.  Thisz 4th.
>David_Gibson: AEGIIV B11 VIG +11 399

>Ryan_Fischer:  (AEI) +6 436
#note I underscored one of my plays by 1, too.
