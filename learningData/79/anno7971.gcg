#note Just after he said he likes open boards.  Oh well!
>Ryan_Fischer: ADINUVW B8 .AVID +28 147
#note 2B WAIV(E) 22?  Prolly.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AEGHIRS A11 HAG +17 168
#note He told me his rack.  Don't know if it involved the blank.  1D HA(N)G(F)IRES 71, if this is right.
>Ryan_Fischer: DMNNOUW 1A UNMOW. +36 183
#note Got lucky on that one.  But 2H (I)NWOUND 38 is a little better.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EEIRRR 1H .ERRIERs +83 251
#note FARRIER and FURRIER, no FERRIER*.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENSWY G8 .NSWAYED +70 253
#note ENDWAYS, but not NEWSDAY* in that rack.  Took me a while, but was fortunate to be able to return fire here.  14A SAWNEY 48 is of note.
>Martin_Weisskopf: HOO H13 OHO +37 288
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCEILT 10E BA.ILECT +66 319
#note I honestly didn't know this until Matt taught it to me two weeks ago when he played CITEABLE.  Thanks!  At this point, some sort of record was in the back of my mind, what with 6 bingos played and 34 tiles left.  Of note are CIT(A)BLE and (A)CTABLE hooking OHO for 40.

>Martin_Weisskopf: AQ 4D QA. +24 353
>Ryan_Fischer: MPRSTTU 12K STUMP +38 410
#note I think STUMP is better than (F)RUMP.  Staticly, Q differs.
>Martin_Weisskopf: DEILO O10 DI.OLE +27 380
>Ryan_Fischer: EIORSTT 8K .ORTE +27 437
#note This is Champ's choice, winning 79%.  I wonder if I can eke it out if he bingos?
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?CEENOS M4 ENCO.ES +24 404
#note M3 COENu(R)ES 83 which I didn't see, 4H (A)CEtONES 70 which I did.  C11 CONE 24 is staticly 3rd.
