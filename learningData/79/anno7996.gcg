#note My first of many, many bad choices in this game. I completely missed bronc and chose this over a number of other options because I liked the ability to play either corns or scorn in case he blocked one. BLNS just isn't prone enough.

#note I guess I played this here instead of 14A because I was scared of a counter at A12.

>Matt_Canik: AEJKORS D4 JOKER +43 223
#note I don't know anything about anything, but I chose joker over joke because I was afraid of a cheap 40 point comeback.

#note No, I guess not.

#note Heh, this actually sims best. Cool.

#note Spent about 9 minutes here, can't find a single play I like, and then come up with a phoney that I think is good that sucks as a play. I can't say anything about this play other than it lost me this game, but I was afraid of anything else because all other plays just game him free points with overlaps. Ugh. 
>Tony_Rankin: DZ 7C Z.D +44 362
#note Awesome.

>Matt_Canik: AAAEITU L1 AI.E +22 346
#note More awesome.
I'm afraid to exchange because I don't want to fall so fat behind that I can't catch up.

#note Nice play. 
>Matt_Canik: ENOTU 13C .ENUTO +13 372
#note AA was played because I knew I'd go out with this. ROWIN was bad and I knew it was when I played it, I just.... bleh. I don't know. This one's on me.
