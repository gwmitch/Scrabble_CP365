#note Was feeling pretty good at this point...
>David_Gibson: BEL K8 L.BE +18 132
>Ryan_Fischer: EINOTTU 10D UNTO +11 145
#note G8 T(H)OU 10.  I showed him my rack, asked him what he'd do, and he said play "OUT" -- essentially, get rid of OUT.  Couldn't quite get it.  He said UNTO wasn't bad though, but served his purpose, sure.
>David_Gibson: EELOPSV E5 ELEVO.S +40 172
#note Said he left a P for ENVELOPS.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIRTTU D9 D.IT +15 160
#note 12K DUIT 18.  I didn't want to chance it for some reason.  Silly.
>David_Gibson: AMPU D3 PUMA +22 194
>Ryan_Fischer: ELLRTUY J11 RULY +17 177
#note This is where I started to get into time trouble.  Q says this is best.  I kept wanting to play TULLY*.  It's TULLE.  Also found myself doubting this versus him.  But if UNRULY, why not?
>David_Gibson: FGIR F2 FRIG +22 216
>Ryan_Fischer: EHLNOQT C2 HON +22 199
#note Shoulda just dumped the Q when I had the chance.  I wanted to try to draw one of those As for QAT alongside there.  Thisz 4th, gives too much back.  HELO or HELOT C11 are options.

#note Uh-oh.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEEGKL 13I G.EBE +20 257
#note 13G BEL(L)EEK 34 (!!!).  No seriously, I was saving up the K to get back in the game, but never could quite put together a K 5.  GLEBE is the best play not using the K.
>David_Gibson: ?ACEIRS -  +0 284
#note I'm as shocked as you.  Thought process: well, if GLEBA is good, and GREBE is good, GLEBE can't be!  At least, that's what I reasoned when he stopped the clock, and as we were walking over, I was sure I had effed up.  Turns out he just had what he joked was a "senior moment."  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AADKLTV C7 AVA +13 270
#note KAVA is just SUICIDAL, Q, considering he just set up an S-hook!  DATA C6 16 is what I need to hope to get back in.
>David_Gibson: ?ACEIRS A3 SCARIEr +92 376
>Ryan_Fischer: ADKLNOT 12L ADO +19 289
#note Still trying to find that K play.  At this point, I was superbly low on time.  I put down ADO and then said "hang on" and checked the bag.  He started his clock, misunderstanding my intention.  No biggie, frazzled us both though.  Game over with no eses, anyway, and this play didn't accomplish much.
>David_Gibson: AC 8K ...AC +21 397
#note Interesting.  Still bingos to be had with the C, unless from his POV that's not the case.
>Ryan_Fischer: IKLNPTT A11 KNIT +21 310
#note Of note: G9 (HO)TLINK 15 (!).
>David_Gibson: AADEGIN B5 AE +10 407
#note He almost played at 14L, setting me up.
