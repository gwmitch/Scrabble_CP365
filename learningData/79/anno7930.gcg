#note The position of interest. I could bingo now, but there's 7 in the bag. If my opponent bingos out (certainly possible with SATIRE etc. in the bag) I'll lose, certainly if I get the Z. Quackle likes playing the various bingos at N5. Mysims at around 86% 4-ply, but bingoing on the colun is around 95%. I obviouly somewhat misjudged the postion.

#note All the best plays leave one in the bag, but this one isn't as good as I though. Best is 12N AH (blocking a possible AZURITE).
