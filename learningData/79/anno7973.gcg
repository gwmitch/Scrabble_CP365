#note Cool, this looks pretty good.  G(A)UR blocks it up just a bit too much for my liking.

#note D4 BAA 15 is sufficient.
>David_Gibson: AKNO C2 KAON +30 180
#note I wrote down KOAN.  I sure hope he didn't play KOAN there.

#note Took him a bit, but he got the fit.

#note Oh wow, I shoulda played at J2!  That little positional advantage is the whole game.  Same score, totally different result.  Le'DAMMIT!  What do I mean?  You'll see...
>David_Gibson: IU 1H .IU +5 281
#note Ruh-oh...
>Ryan_Fischer: IMNSTVY A12 .YMN +36 363
#note I asked him about this after the game.  He said he didn't know what he'd do, but I'm pretty sure he'd find mONETIZE/ZONETImE if he had to.  He says you pretty much have to take (H)YMN because of the points and position.  A11 T(H)YMI and A8 SMIT(H)Y are options.  (I)VY, T(I)VY, and V(I)NY, too, but bleh. (A)MITY isn't that close at all.
>David_Gibson: ?EEINOZ M7 EbONIZE +88 369
>Ryan_Fischer: CILNSTV B9 VIC. +11 374
#note I can't play C(I)VIL or V(I)NIC, emptying the bag.  Let's see what Champ says...  Oh wow, VIN(E), Q?  Really?  With JO unseen you want me to set up a 35-point J play?  And it wins 33%?  I can't play IC(K), I can't play V(I)NIC, so VIC(E) it is.  Other than BIGGER, I am extremely happy with my play, and just got screwed in the endgame draw.

#note N11 SALT 23 is Champ's choice.  Following that path loses by 16.
