>Matt_Canik: BDGGNTU 8G BUNG +14 14
#note So I've just lost four straight games and I'm totally bummed out. I don't like to make excuses for myself, but I pretty much wasn't trying for a long time here until things got interesting. I'm just posting this for the endgame. BUNDT keeping GG..? I guess.

#note HM 2J is also noteworthy.

>Matt_Canik: DDEJNRU 8A DUDE +27 123
#note Didn't know DURED and saw JUN like two seconds after I hit my clock. I still had 22:31 on my clock at this point, just threw down the first thing I saw on most of these plays because I wanted to go home (last game of the day)

#note Actually saw HARKENER and chickened out on it. Doh. Now that I have the blank, my attitude shifts and I kinda start thinking here. Clearly it didn't help me much.

>Robert_Fenske: EEISZ 12H SEIZE +33 326
>Matt_Canik: AENORTT 13J TARO +23 330
#note And now I can't remember if seizer is good but balk on it. My biggest problem this tournament (aside from being too emotional) was being extremely shaky on words. I almost balked on ANEURINS earlier. (I didn't)

>Matt_Canik: EINPSTT 3B P..T +6 336
#note If nothing else, it sets up SPORT. 
>Robert_Fenske: VY F11 .VY +9 368
#note So due to a counting error on his behalf, we have the score at 336-370. Find the win (for me).
