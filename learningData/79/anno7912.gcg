>Villain: ABCEHKV 8D HACEK +36 36
#note While there are no alternatives to HACEK, we do have the option of playing HACEK at 8d for two fewer points.  HACEK 8d makes it more difficult to use the DLS squares at the center of the board for parallel plays and makes the board more defensive.  Since we are keeping a poor BV leave, having an open board with scoring options next turn is undesirable.  The B and the V are defensive tiles: thus, it makes sense to play HACEK at 8d, since that placement is more conducive to the BV leave.
>Hero: AAILNRT E5 TAL.RIA +28 28
>Villain: ABHINRV F4 BAH +31 67
#note Although H and N are good tiles individually, the H and N retain a poor synergy.  Since we still aren't going to have a good bingo leave anyway, we should still keep the board limited to scoring and bingo opportunities.  BRAVI is a much more aggressive play, but our leave is not conducive to aggressive play.
>Hero: NNNSSUU I8 SUNN +20 48
#note While we could play NUN d4, NSSU is simply not strong enough of a leave.  It is worth the 4 points to play off the S and keep the board somewhat limited, since our opponent is likely to have a decent leave.  While we are behind, it is too early to play needlessly aggressively.
>Villain: ACDINRV G3 RAVIN.D +31 98
#note Since our opponent has played off an S, plays like VICED are suicidal, since they exhibit poor scoring defense.  And while ACRID scores more points, the V is not a good tile on this board, and ACRID opens up bingo lines for what is likely a very good leave that your opponent is retaining.  RAVINED is unlikely to open up a large h1 play because of the R at 3g: making a parallel play with the E as the third tile is somewhat difficult.
>Hero: DELLNSU H1 DUELS +36 84
#note On this board, the S is less valuable than normal, since there is only one S hook (SUNNS) which is likely to be blocked soon.  In addition, after DUEL you are already keeping two consonants: the L and N, so the S as a third consonant is unwelcome.  While UNLED would normally be welcomed, the S just isn't useful on this board.  While LN are antisynergic, the antisynergy is not significant enough to stop you from playing DUEL.
>Villain: ?ACEINR 1A INARChE. +83 181
#note While other bingos are available, INARChED is best because it gives up few 8 letter words on the left side of the board.  Generally, few words start with vowels, so the I is a safe tile to leave open.  Meanwhile, very few 8 letter words start with N: While there are around 570 8 letter words starting with N, there are over 1700 8 letter words starting with R and over 2700 8 letter words starting with C.  Thus, INARChED is better than DICENtRA and CRANnIED since it leaves fewer 8 letter words for your opponent.
>Hero: AFLNOTY F8 .OFT +36 120
#note This position has a myriad of options, but COFT is the best play for many reasons.  One reason is that it doesn't open the board for your opponent to make a high scoring play or bingo.  Plays like FLOATY or FLOAT allow your opponent too many possibilities to be effective.  Another reason why COFT is a good play is that it keeps a good scoring play.  On a board with few bingo opportunities, keeping a leave such as ALNY has value since it is a pretty easy rack to score with, because the Y is a good scoring tile and because the rack has a lot of synergy.  Leaves such as ALNT after FOY are unlikely to bingo because of the closed board, while the leave is stable and significantly better than the NO leave after FATLY.
>Villain: IOOSTUX B1 .OXIOUS +32 213
#note The 3 most attractive options in this position are OX 2b (31), NOXIOUS b1 (32), and ROUX d1 (22).  TUX scores more points than NOXIOUS, but the leave of IOOS is too imbalanced, and will often lead to an exchange.  ROUX scores okay and keeps a respectable IOST leave, but that leave is not very strong on this board because of the lack of bingo opportunities available.  Meanwhile, OX scores nearly as much as NOXIOUS and keeps an IOSTU leave.  While the leave has potential to score well and may even form a bingo, the leave could also turn disastrous because of the number of vowels available, and the play of OX gives your opponent scoring plays in line 3.  NOXIOUS gives your opponent far less: since it is difficult to parallel the U at 6a, the a8 TWS is not a significant threat.
>Hero: AGLNPWY A5 GNAW +31 151
#note In this position, the LPY leave of GNAW is much stronger than the GP leave after YAwP and the GP leave after each placement of WANLY.  In addition to opening less for your opponent, the PLY is a good scoring leave: well balanced since the Y can serve as a vowel.  The GLN leave is weak because of the difficulty to play a bingo on this board.
>Villain: BEEEEOT -BEEEEOT +0 213
#note While keeping ET is slightly better than keeping nothing, in this position ET has two things going against it.  The first thing is that there are no bingo lines a leave that is essentially a bingo leave.  The second factor is that including the tiles in your rack, there are 9 Es and 4 Ts left in a 51 tile pool, so duplication will be a factor in upcoming turns, primarily in the draw after this draw.  For these two reasons, you are better off trading all of your tiles.
>Hero: AEELOPY 3A O.EYE +30 181
#note The A is especially strong in this position because of the SUNN-A hook and since there is only one A remaining in the bag.  This makes OXEYE a much stronger play than PAYEE 12h.
>Villain: AEFLNTW D11 FLEW +26 239
#note With only one A available in the bag and 6 Es, the SUNNA hook, and the lack of bingo options (making scoring leaves stronger), keeping the A is preferable to the E.  
>Hero: AELOPTZ H11 AZOTE +74 255
#note AZOTE is better than AZOLE because PL is slightly more synergic than PT and because there are 3 Ts remaining in the bag.  
>Villain: AGINSTV 15A VIGS +39 278
#note While REV keeping the powerful AGINST leave would normally be an option, there are too many scoring spots to make the play feasible.  Although REV results in a lot of bingos even on this board, scoring spots using the bottom left corner are significant in this position.
>Hero: EILMPRT 13G P.ITREL +26 281
#note Again, there are many options available.  We can divide them into long plays and short plays.  PERITI scores the most points, but leaves lines 13 through 15 open and keeps a poor leave.  Your opponent can either use these lines to play a bingo or to make a high scoring parallel play that closes the board.  MOTLIER is another reasonable option, but isn't as good because the M is a better tile than the P.  POITREL is better than POLITER since it doesn't allow as many overlaps and makes the board harder to shut down for your opponent.  POITREL is also better than OPTIME because the M leave (which can score and bingo) is better than the R leave, which isn't much good on this board.  POITREL is the best of the long plays.  Fishing plays on this board won't work because there are no bingos, and since we don't want to allow our opponent to score using the OTE in AZOTE, we are better off playing MIL at i13.  However, POITREL is better, since we would like to draw the blank and keep the board open since we are behind.
>Villain: ADDNQRT B12 QAD. +28 306
#note QADI is better than QAT because of the importance of distribution.  Getting rid of the D allows you one more chance to draw a vowel and rids yourself of a duplicate D.
>Hero: EEEIMPT J9 PETI.E +23 304
#note Although PEG c13 (29) scores more and EEIMT is a decent leave, this position has slowly devolved into a race for the blank.  PETITE creates a second S hook that won't likely be blocked and turns over more tiles for the blank.  EEIMT is not a very good bingo leave for this board unless the blank is drawn.
>Villain: DJMNORT L12 D.RM +20 326
#note DERM scores well while leaving the desired number of tiles left on your rack, since any scoring play by your opponent will need to use 3 tiles.  DERM also assures a play for your J next turn and keeps a leave that scores well and is relatively stable.
>Hero: ?BEIIMY 15L .IB +7 311
#note MIB sets up your blank for a potentially lucrative score along line o.  Blocking MIB will prove to be a challenge left.  It also plays only two tiles and this maintains endgame timing for next turn.
>Villain: GJNOORT 13A J.G.R +26 352
#note JAGER wins with 5 out of the 8 tiles in the bag, losing if an O or 
>Hero: ?EEIMUY 2E UM +24 335
#note MIBs isn't going anywhere, but maximizing your M is a must, otherwise your opponent will block this spot next turn with HO and go out with ONTO.  Playing UM first gives you two scoring plays instead of one.
>Villain: NOOOT 9A NO +11 363
#note The highest scoring out in two, but it falls just short.
>Hero: ?EEIY O12 EYEs +42 377
#note Wins by a point.
>Villain: OOT K8 OOT +11 374
#note This annotated game has shown you the different strengths and weaknesses of each tiles and has expressed some of the ways that tiles can change value.  There are many other ways that tiles can change value: many of which have been expressed at other points within the book.
