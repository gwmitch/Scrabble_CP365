#note I saw OGIVE but didn't want to open up another lane. This is why I suck. (-10) One, I can't close all the lanes anyway. Two, OGIVE is more points. Three, OGIVE keeps a better leave. Facepalm.

#note Championship Player says that the more straightforward POISE 15A wins the most often. I thought about that, but it seems like I lose if I draw any vowel, and Jesse probably didn't have the E when he played WAN. After ROUE, however, I'll be able to play out at 5D or E15 pretty often. I suppose POISE could win if the H is still out, but that didn't seem likely.
