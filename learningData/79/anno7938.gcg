>Ryan_Fischer: EGMPRSS 1K S.REP +21 248
#note Again, looking for MIS(QUOTED), drawing as many tiles as I can.  Lots of plays staticly better, but this one SOARS to the top of the sim!  :)
>Steve_Bush: ANN 4H NAN +17 227
#note Nice play!  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGIMNS 12F SEEMING +85 333
#note I get it and draw the bingo!  Oh well.  Missed (R)EGIMENS for 94.  Oops!

#note O8 (P)INELaND 83
>Ryan_Fischer: EFILMVV 10C V.LVE +19 352
#note FLIVVE... M.  (AW!).  No sense in opening any lanes with VIVE or something.
>Steve_Bush: ARY 15F YAR +32 333
#note Aw.  Penalty for missing REGIMENS.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDFIMOR B11 CO.F +24 376
#note Close the line, safe the D for O12.  Took me awhile to see that.
>Steve_Bush: AIO 4L .IAO +10 343
>Ryan_Fischer: DIIMOOR O12 DOOR +29 405
#note That could be trouble.  Backdoor hope of MIs(QUOTED) still, so played DOOR instead of DOOM.  Plus, the M is good for scoring in the endgame.

#note Best.  Some words through the T work too.
