#note keeping the QU didn't seem to have much potential. however BROOM at 9D does pretty well. I guess it sets up a lot of nice scoring plays on row 10.

#note the only bingo, but I guess if I know KNOTTINGS then passing up a bingo and playing NIP or NAPA might give me a better chance of winning. it's pretty tight on the sim.

#note this is maybe a little too crazy. NAE does best.

#note keeping the U for some kind of big Q bingo seemed to be the best chance I had. I only thought of TWEENY and not SWEENY though so I didn't realize that lane was up there.

#note thought about fishing for adequate. realized it wouldn't be enough. however EQUALED sims way better since it creates another good lane. I passed it up but should've realized how much better it was.

#note CAY is best according to championship player. probably has something to do with plays at 15 that he can't block. DECAY is significantly better because it goes out with more tiles.
