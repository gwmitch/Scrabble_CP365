>Bill: EIIPRRT H6 TRIPIER +70 70
>Bill: EIIPRRT --  -70 0
#note I pretty much knew this was Collins only but I figured I'd slap it down quick and see what happened.
>Jim: HOW 8F WHO +18 18
>Bill: EIIPRRT I6 RIP +18 18
#note Dang, didn't even look at the W - TRIPWIRE. Not like I just had the letters in almost exactly that order or anything.
>Jim: AEF 6F FEA. +15 33
>Bill: EHIRTTZ 5B ZITHER +43 61
>Jim: CDEI 5I DICE +21 54
>Bill: ADFGMTY 4L MATY +34 95
#note This is Collins only, and FADGE is probably better anyway. I think I was trying to draw a challenge, which shows how hilariously bad I am at keeping the dictionaries separate.
>Jim: ?AIOPST K5 .APTIOnS +72 126
#note Ooh, DYSTOPIA.
>Bill: DEFGINV 3I VINED +37 132
#note Our club is easing into the new words with just the twos and threes now, hence why DA is okay. I think I passed on DEFYING partly for board control and partly because an I would give me GIF for 29 at 2J.
>Jim: O O4 .O +5 131
>Bill: DEEFGKN O4 ..KED +39 171
#note I didn't want to do KEF setting up an S hook in the triple lane, plus I would assume he's not fishing one with an X or Q so I have a chance to draw one of those for 2J (though I would also need to draw the requisite I). C3 FEIGNED is a better execution of these ideas, since I get double the number of chances to draw X/Q and retain the K to use there next turn if it comes to that.
>Jim: I 10K .I +2 133
>Bill: EEFGNUV B3 FU.E +18 189
#note I missed FEUING. FUZE is dumb, going against the idea from last turn to not give him a triple lane. Other than FEUING, though, none of the options are great.
>Jim: GILNSTU G8 .USTLING +64 197
#note TUSSLING
>Bill: EEGNTUV 15D VEN.E +39 228
>Jim: AJR A6 RAJ +32 229
>Bill: GLORTUY 12D GUL.Y +26 254
#note Wanted to retain a vowel in case the draw was horrible.
>Jim: COW 10D COW. +17 246
>Bill: ?LNOORT 2J LO +10 264
#note Aaaarrrgghhhh, I saw ORTOLAN and thought it was Collins only and PORTOLAN was good in TWL. It's the other way around.
>Jim: ABEINST N7 BASINET +68 314
>Bill: ?NNORRT O12 TORN +20 284
>Jim: AEX A1 AXE +35 349
>Bill: ?ABEMRU J9 AM +23 307
#note This is a tough call, I wanted to play short to avoid the Q and keep something agreeable with the row 1 and 14 lanes, but at the current deficit I could definitely lose some games with a bingo, and conversely I could win some games after 1K EMBAR with no bingo but a Q draw. I still think this is fine.
>Jim: DG 4A D.G +24 373
>Bill: ?ABENRU 1A .RBUtEAN +80 387
>Jim: AEILOOS -  +0 373
#note Challenged, he doesn't realize I'm Q stuck.
>Bill: QR B3 ....R +19 406
#note What a bitter end to the game. He didn't bother challenging FUZER*.
>Jim: AEILOOS 9A ALE +15 388
>Bill: Q -  +0 406
>Jim: IOOS E3 OO. +6 394
>Bill: Q -  +0 406
>Jim: IS 11C SI +8 402
#note 10A for 12 more. Passing on ORTOLAN was probably costly, since I would've been up 15 after BASINET and might've drawn the S to hook it. The Q stick after ARBUTEAN sucked but wasn't that unexpected. Dictionary confusion got me twice this game, could've been three times if he'd challenged off MATY. If you TWLers think Collins players have attitudes, this is why.
