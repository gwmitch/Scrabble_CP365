#note I always like a complete puzzle, and Jim uploaded his version, so I will upload mine with detailed commentary for these two games. For Jim's commentary for this one, go to /20235.
>Jim: AEORSVW 8C AVOWERS +84 84
>Sid: AAEEHLR 7G HAE +25 25
#note This might look like a board closing play, but I think it works out in my favor more often than not. Aside from points + leave, I like this over something like HAVEREL to block freak 8's  for Jim with random racks and fork the board into high prob, hittable, somewhat low scoring lanes for sevens, allowing me to come back in the game without allowing Jim to run away with it.
>Jim: AADEINT F8 .ADI +12 96
>Sid: AEEILNR E8 .LEA +17 42
#note I think I made the correct decision here. I correctly eschewed A(I)RLINE. It doesn't seem to be opening anything crazy, but I felt like it blew up my rack while offering Jim maybe 7-9 more points on average than OLEA. Quackle confirms my suspicion, as this wins the sim and gives back much fewer on average. I'm not closing the board, but limiting Jim's scoring opportunities while retaining fair bingo chances.
>Jim: AAEENRT -AE +0 96
>Sid: AEINORT C5 AER.TION +60 102
#note Normally I would slightly prefer the 8 extra points, but in this case, what could Jim's range of leaves possibly be? I figured an S was possible but unlikely, because he took so long to exchange. My instinct tells me that if he's holding AERST, EIRST, etc, the exchange (or play) would have come down much more quickly. 
I figured that Jim's leave is likely a 3c2v high prob leave, such as EINRT, AELRT, EGINR, etc, that utilized some of the hooks available on the board. Jim could also be holding a C, P or an M, but less likely because he would probably make a scoring play. There's also a slight chance that Jim could hold 3 vowels, something like AEIRT. This depends on what I think his tendencies are. An exchange 3 would be more likely if he had 2 bingo consonants, but I know many 1700-1800 players who would keep AEIRT. 
Against all these possible ranges, I felt it was justifiable to sacrifice points to avoid slotting a x9. Another reason I chose to play for 60 was to open scoring spots because I was drawing 7 random tiles and he has 5 single point tiles. Since I didn't think he had an S, opening an S scoring spot is also to my advantage (along with b6 & b10). I told Jim that this may be a mistake in case he does actually have an S, but upon further review, I stand by my play. 
>Jim: ADENRTU J1 UNRATED +70 166
>Sid: ADJOTUW B11 JUDO +35 137
#note I considered B4 JAW, this, and D3 JAW/JOW. Normally I wouldn't open up such a juicy hotspot, but with this particular pool, I felt like I wasn't actually increasing Jim's average score by very much at all. Quackle confirms my suspicion; Jim's average score after JUDO is only 1 more than D3 JAW/JOW and 2 more than B4 JAW. Thus, for the score and keeping a relatively flexible leave, I thought this was worth it. JUDO wins the sim.
>Jim: ?CEIMRU 4E MURIC.tE +74 240
>Sid: AAAFITW B3 FATWA +36 173
#note This gives back around 5 more points on average than B5 AWA, but bingoes 12% more often, so I think it's definitely worth it.
>Jim: BIKL A12 BILK +52 292
#note Jim's average score after UNRATED was 48-50-ish regardless, so this isn't actually that big of a blow.
>Sid: ADEGIIP D12 GIED +30 203
#note I chose this over GADI because I held the last A, while there were many E's left.
>Jim: EELLMUZ A2 LEZ +48 340
>Sid: AEIINPX A6 APEX +50 253
#note Chose this over PIXIE for 42 to leave more space open on the top of the board.

>Sid: GIINOVY 15D .IVING +33 286
>Jim: BNQRSTT M1 B.TS +24 432
#note Held and released. A pretty awful non-challenge on my part.

>Sid: IOOPRSY F2 YO. +14 323
#note This handily destroys the sim. I could win this game if Jim has 7 consonants without an H (to block with HM) and I hit MORPHINS. If Jim has 7 consonants including the H, I could hit IMPOSERS, IMPOSTER, and IMPOSTOR as x9's and other normal bingos if he overlooks HM as a block.
>Jim: GHNNOQT O1 O. +12 454
>Sid: CIOPRSS 5B ..COS +29 352
>Jim: GHNNOQT G14 Q. +11 465
#note Funny thing is that Jim makes the correct endgame play, but still loses 100 points of spread. :p
>Sid: EEINPRS J9 REPINES +75 427
#note I'm lucky this stayed on! This was by no means an 18 point contest. Overall, I think I played pretty well this game after review.
