#note Strongly considered K4 HUE. Eventually I went for this because I deemed the potential L1 hotspot after HUE to be more dangerous than putting a P at H10. But EPST is definitely better than ESTU.

#note (PUL)LEY! I think I did this instead of 14A (A)Y to make PUL harder to hook.

#note Bingos making multiple underlaps on row 13 actually score more.

#note Forgot about PULA entirely, luckily this was here or I would have failed to bingo.

#note I should have realized this wasn't an S setup. If Bryan wanted to set up his S, he would play the obvious 13M XI.

#note It's an S setup! Block! Block! Block!

-Charles' brain

(you could make the argument to leave the T off so as to not set up a triple lane, since the only way Bryan could reasonably get back into this is to bingo for 90 or 100 points)
>Bryan_Benwitz: CEIINOV 1G INVOICE +97 339
#note :(
>Charles_Reinke: DDEIMOT 11K MOD +25 379
#note A confusing position. Do I take the INVOICE(D) hook with DOITED/DOMED/DOM and open ANOTHER triple lane after I just got burned? Or do I play it safe?

N1 DOM looks to be mostly safe since Bryan would need a six-tile play to reach the TWS. This play sets up a bingo lane unnecessarily.
>Bryan_Benwitz: IQ N10 QI +38 377
>Charles_Reinke: DDEGIST N1 DIGEST +34 413
#note 8A DIGEST(IF) is really cool, but this is best because, as far as I can tell, Bryan can't bingo after it.
