>Joshua_Sokol: AABEHJT H7 JAB +24 24
#note A H8 or H6 placement is interesting, but ultimately doing that doesn't seem better
>Ricky_Sirois: DEISZ 10H SIZED +48 48
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABEHTW 11K HEW +31 55
>Ricky_Sirois: ACENO I4 CANOE +20 68
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABETTT J5 TAB +25 80
#note I guess I could have been ballsy here and played 12L BETA. Just BET looks dumb though. I decided to play the patience game, which seems better against Ricky compared to aggro plays such as BET or BETA.
>Ricky_Sirois: ENW K4 NEW +24 92
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGNTTU N6 TUrGENT +71 151
#note The other bingo is GRUTTEN. I knew TURGENT but not GRUTTEN. GRUTTEN may be better. Not sure.
>Ricky_Sirois: ALM 8L MA.L +24 116
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIIUY 12L YE.I +35 186
#note Ugh, here starts the flipflop between DEYS being valid or invalid. Given my uncertainty I should play something else. But my incertainty is really really bad.
>Ricky_Sirois: INX M5 NIX. +38 154
>Ricky_Sirois: INX --  -38 116
#note Hallelujah, a challenge that I won!
>Joshua_Sokol: EFINORU L1 FINO +26 212
#note Now I have to play given the partial rack knowledge I have. I know he has NIX, so maybe he has (F)IXT here. Doesn't look like he could have much else that hurts. Really looking over this play again, there is just no need to be so aggressive. M4 FOU for 8 points is just fine. EINR will really help me for the rest of this game. I can continue to keep well until he opens something up, and then hopefully I can punish him. I chose the other, less skillful route here and I am disappointed in myself.
>Ricky_Sirois: ILNUX 1J IN.LUX +48 164
#note also he could just have LU...
>Joshua_Sokol: ACELRRU 5E ARCU... +18 230
#note M3 UREA is a play I didn't see. I should have and I should have considered it. I like it. I don't remember if I was on the DEYS is valid or the DEYS is invalid side of the world this turn. That obviously changes a lot. ARCUATE gets better if DEYS is valid, since there are already two easy lanes to hit.
>Ricky_Sirois: ADIQ 6B QAID +37 201
>Joshua_Sokol: EGILMRV C2 VIRG. +18 248
#note The more worried I got, the more I wanted to think DEYS was invalid. This play takes that into account I think. Taking everything else out. I hated VIM or VIG at 7A cause it releases all of the control I have on this board. But I really have no control whatsoever with my uncertainty about a 4.
>Ricky_Sirois: FKO 4A FO.K +30 231
#note don't get aggravated, Josh
>Joshua_Sokol: DELMNOT A1 DEL.T +27 275
>Ricky_Sirois: AOV 3L .OVA +14 245
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIMNOR 2A .N.IRO +22 297
#note Now with the other blank in hand I am a bit settled. This isn't great with two P's out but it looks like it works much more than it doesn't.
>Ricky_Sirois: EOPRS 1D POSER +41 286
#note could have been worse I guess. Perhaps I should have played it safe with just M7 MA/MU.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HMRSUY G3 YU.H +16 313
#note I don't know if this was my rack, so I'll leave commentary out for this turn.
>Ricky_Sirois: EP 3F P.E +13 299
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEMORS 7L AM. +19 332
#note Bingo! But wait, DEYS isn't a word, is it... In any case it's not correct to bingo here! If he bingos out I lose. I did consider playing DEYS and bingoing just to get the uncertainty over with, but there are better plays. Obviously knowing DEYS, MORSE and MARSE or AROSE at 13I are the best plays. They score great and leave one in the bag, which isn't a terrible thing in this position. This also looks better than playing a bingo but not nearly as good as the other options I just described.
>Ricky_Sirois: DEOS 13J DOSE +30 329
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILORS 14E LORrIES +67 399
#note I held, but even though I was convinced DEYS was phony it just made no sense whatsoever to challenge.
