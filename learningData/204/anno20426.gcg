#note a poor play, keeping the V is actually a positive since I have great letters to go with it and my resulting bingos will score more. but, should really just take the points for JAPE, which I somehow missed

#note so many Is left! I thought of LONGE which sims best by 4 points but I was happy to try to hit a P...ING bingo on column N. in retrospect, now is a good time for LONGE, need options

#note ahhhh QUICKIE is genius!!! I wish I had thought of it. the situation is pretty bad here, OILIER at 13B is a reasonable try but even QUICKIE will win very infrequently...
