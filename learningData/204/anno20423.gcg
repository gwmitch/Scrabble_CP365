#note *look up*
>cesar: IILNNRW 13H .WIN +11 176
#note 7H WIN might be best, but this kind of move is super difficult for me. -ILNW sims highly as well. TWIN didn't seem too far worse than the other options. Perhaps exchanging is best here, but I was feeling kind of pessimistic about my chances. (-0.5)

>cesar: BEENRTZ 2F BR.EZE +43 375
#note i was very tempted to do BONZE 6G here but thought i'd better play a little bingo defense. my bingo chances after BONZE though are more than 50% !!! (-5)
>mike: AIILO 1K AIOLI +20 296
#note apparently I blocked something like hE(M)IOLIA!
>cesar: DGINNTT 6G D.TTING +11 386
#note dotting is not a good move; should have looked harder for something simple like K4 TINGED/NIDGET/etc.  (-6.5)

#note because he can block KNEW with A2 NEWSY/YEWS etc
