>Darrell_Day: EINNORU -EINN +0 0
#note My annotation is a little vague.  Not sure whether he exchanged 3 or 4 tiles, but he definitely exchanged.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADENOT 8D DONATEd +68 68
#note Nice opening rack!  The only "problem" wth a rack like this is that there can sometimes be too many options. I should have taken the time to look for options with better vowel placement. 8G TANgOED looks best.
>Darrell_Day: ACERSWY G3 RACEW.YS +75 75
#note And, if I take the time to find TANGOED, he's playing for 65 instead of 75; that's an 8-point swing.
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEGJT 4G .BJECT +40 108
#note Best; none of theother options scores more than 34.  At this point, I was thinking, "I hit the easy blank bingo on turn 1, and just cashed the J for 40 on turn 2.  Thsi is going to be a bag job in my favor."  Little did I know the tile gods had other ideas in store.
>Darrell_Day: AADILV 6F V.DALIA +21 96
>Jim_Burlant: AEGHUUY 3C HUGE. +18 126
#note For those of you paying attention, this is the second time in three games I've left myself no U's on turn N and had duplicated U's on turn N+1.    I didn't like this play at all when I made it, and the sim reveals the play I should have made (but I never saw it):  AUGUR 3C. It cleans out both U's and leaves me EHY so I can play HEY 5K for 37 on the next turn.  The consolation:  it doesn't change what's about to happen:
>Darrell_Day: EEFMORR D8 .EFORMER +80 176
>Jim_Burlant: AFINSUY 13B FU.Y +24 150
#note Too much rack grooming.  OFAY E8 scores 40 and wins 35-1/2%. This wins 33.3 and sims 4 points down.
>Darrell_Day: EIP 7G .IPE +26 202
>Jim_Burlant: AINNPRS 4A PAIN +27 177
#note The sim says the difference between this and NIP B is splitting airs.   If I had this one to do again, NIP looks better, both for the leave (ANRS instead of NRS) and board position (setting up the S hook that he may not have).
>Darrell_Day: MOZ 11B ZO.M +30 232
>Jim_Burlant: EINNRRS -NR +0 177
#note The tell-tale sign of how this game was going:  with two 3x3's open his intermediate play leaves both alone and also takes away my intended fish.  No reason to exchange here - NOR E7 puts a handful more points on the board.  I just got frazzled and missed NOR E7.  I don't agree with Quackle's assessment that I should dump the rack with PINNER for 24 just yet; too many juicy openings that, IMO, I'm too likely to hit.
>Darrell_Day: BLTU 15A BLU.T +21 253
>Jim_Burlant: DEINNRS A4 .INNED +27 204
#note No bingoes play.  I sometimes don't get Quackle.  On the last turn it wanted me to dump the rack with PINNER.  Now it says I should just fish?  Whatever. While I'm not playing well, the sim confirms these draws are not giving me any help.  Best play wins 16%, and this wins just shy of 15.
>Darrell_Day: OW C9 WO. +24 277
>Jim_Burlant: IKNORRS 3L IRK +16 220
#note I saw IRK 2A and felt that, while it scored 8 more, it didn't really help me.  And if he has the Q or the X, I've given him easy points.  If he doesn't have an S, this is going to be very difficult for him to block, and the right draw can put me right back in the game.  Q wants me to play at 2A, but I'm fine with this. 
>Darrell_Day: ?AEIOTV 12D .AVIgOTE +68 345
>Jim_Burlant: DLNORST H12 .OLD +12 232
#note  I need to recognize that I'm going to need two bingoes plus a power tile bomb to win, and there aren't enough tiles remaining in the pool to do that.  In short, I need to realize the game is over and all I should do is go into damage control mode and take points to keep this from getting more out of  hand than it already is.  Obsessing about hitting for 80 down the O column isn't going to do anything for me at this point.
>Darrell_Day: AEILNOS L9 ANISOLE +88 433
#note Consolation:  Even if I play DOLTS, he still bingoes with KAOLINES.
>Jim_Burlant: GNRSTUX M7 TUX +36 268
#note TUXES K9 scores 48 but I'm still clinging to hope that I can just maybe draw into an O column bingo that wil allow me to save spread.  I shouldn't have bothered.
