>Richard_Popper: AF 8G FA +10 10
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIOOSY 7G OY +17 17
#note this is a very funny finish to the tournament. Richard wanted to pack up and leave early so I obliged and played him during the lunch break Joe Edley himself created by making a fuss about the pairings. Trying to block the most things possible here.
>Richard_Popper: ABENRSV I8 BRAVENS +72 82
#note braven isn't even a word

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEEIST F1 EErIEST +66 93
>Richard_Popper: CDHIPR 1A PIRCH.D +54 162
#note I was trying to figure out why he played this if PIRCH was not a word. I couldn't. My senses were really screwed up this game. Richard was just throwing anything down. I should have gathered word security this game.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADIKORT L3 KADI +26 375
#note why leave that lane open? DARKI(E) is a lot of points at 12D but I don't think I should risk him bingoing twice.
>Richard_Popper: ATW M2 TAW +29 286
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOORT N1 LOTA +25 400
#note First saw LOTA and then stopped even though I was content with it, and saw TOEA. I thought the pool was consonant-heavy enough that LOTA was better. It seems close though
