>Joshua_Sokol: AAABHIL H8 AHA +12 12
#note It was an interesting choice here between AHA and LABIA. They are both very very close on a sim. I'm not sure which to choose against Ryan.
>Ryan_Chepita: ILTU G6 LITU +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEILNV I3 VIABLE +19 31
#note F2 VINEAL, VEINAL or VENIAL are all quite better than this. I wanted to keep the board closed early cause I think Ryan is sort of a bingo-oriented player, but VINEAL and VEINAL do that just fine.
>Ryan_Chepita: ADINORT F9 DIATRON +69 83
#note In any case he managed to bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ENOQUW J5 WO +18 49
#note I think I got kind of impatient here. 15F (N)OW is fine. It is a good thing to keep QUE? here though. I don't think I should get rid of my Q. This does set me up for a lot of points but I shouldn't leave Ryan, who has just drawn 7 tiles, easy scoring spots to take advantage of.
>Ryan_Chepita: AEFK 15D KE.AF +51 134
#note Or things like this may happen.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EENQUY K3 QUEY +52 101
#note I'm good with taking the points here, even though I did consider just QUE(R)Y for 10 less. QUER(Y) leaves me with more options for the rest of the game than QUEY does, while immediately blocking lanes that Ryan can hit.
>Ryan_Chepita: BIMR L1 BRIM +41 175
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACDENO 12F .ACNODEs +76 177
#note 13F (R)ANCOrED is the only option that scores more than this. I didn't know the word. I took a long while here looking for things through the B but there are none. I considered trying CODE(B)ANk*, confident it was bs. Ryan has a slight advantage here, but I can deal with that.  RANCORED is probably a bit better than my play.
>Ryan_Chepita: GIR 1L .RIG +21 196
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEEEJY 11B DEEJ.Y +39 216
#note there is perhaps something to be said about keeping the J here and playing 11I EYED or 13C DEC(R)Y, but I am find just taking the equity at this point in the game and keeping up with Ryan.
>Ryan_Chepita: HOR 13L RHO +22 218
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGGISX D9 EX.C +26 242
#note So here I remember my thought process quite well. Ryan probably has the S since he took a while to play this. I don't think he would have played it if he didn't have one, and if he would have, it would have been sooner. Maybe instead he has the blank. That might make sense as well. But in any case I felt like my chances of drawing an N were good here, and better to prevent plays through the E's in DEEJAY than not. I really have no idea why I didn't just go for the points though with SEX or SIX pluralizing RHO. I guess I didn't want to play scared, but taking out easy lanes is a good idea against Ryan. Between the two EXEC spots, I decided this one was better cause I could pluralize it for points next turn if I wanted to, and cause it leaves me with insurance that if Ryan bingos I still have a chance to catch up with a bingo of my own.
>Ryan_Chepita: ATW C8 TWA. +29 247
>Joshua_Sokol: GGIIOSS 13A GIGS +26 268
#note not too bad of a pull. I am now in good shape.
>Ryan_Chepita: EFRT 14L REFT +32 279
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILOSU H12 .UI. +9 277
#note This was a really bizarre position. The pool is great, so it does indeed make sense to go for a bingo here. Especially since Ryan probably has good tiles as well. I saw that I could=often draw into a bingo after this play given the prevalence of consonants in the pool, and I might even hit something like LOONIES(T) at O7. But the pool is so good, I might as well go for points. I don't know if I considered OILIES(T) O8. If I had, I think I should have gone for it, so I don't think I considered it. A12 I(G)LU is also less fishy, and scores quite well. I considered LOUIE at B5 and F2 as well, but they didn't seem to benefit me at all. It feels like my E is very important here for synergistic purposes. So anyways, I should really just play OILIES(T) here. My play is too fishy and risky.
>Ryan_Chepita: AM A13 .AM +18 297
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNOOS O7 LOONIES. +84 361
#note Although it paid off
>Ryan_Chepita: ?DINORS B2 INDORSe +69 366
#note At this point Ryan is not a favorite to win, but it seems he needs to unload anyway and hope for the best. This seems like the right play. Good on Ryan.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNNPTZ J10 PL.TZ +42 403
#note I'm in OK shape here still
>Ryan_Chepita: AEESTUV A8 VAU +33 399
#note but not with his rack... He has 3 wins, of which he picked the worst. UVEA and EAVES in the same spot are 2 points better.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENNOP N5 OPEN +16 419
#note It was so frustrating to see one point loss after two point loss and not be able to come up with anything. I knew PINONE* was phony, but there is no chance he isn't challenging it, is there?
>Ryan_Chepita: EEST C2 TEES +19 418
#note Maybe he would have missed STEE(L) and I should have played PEON at A2 for the 2 point loss unless he misses his out. 

>Ryan_Chepita:  (N) +2 420
#note Great game, there were definitely spots that I could have gotten myself more than that one point difference between our scores and won the game.
