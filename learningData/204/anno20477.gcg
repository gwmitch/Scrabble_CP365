>Siddharth_Murali: ?ABFHNO 8G FOB +16 16
#note I had a pretty wild tournament, so why not upload some games for a change? Yum
>Darrell_Day: BDEINOR I5 RIB.ONED +67 67
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AHJNPT 6F HAJ. +22 38
#note I was perplexed by this turn. I thought this was worth the one point sacrifice from HAJ. This looks as good as anything except THuJA, which is pretty clearly the favorite.
>Darrell_Day: AEIMV H11 MAVIE +41 108
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EGKNPT 5E KEP +27 65
>Darrell_Day: EIIN 11H ..INIE +16 124
>Siddharth_Murali: ?GLNNOT L8 TOL.NG +16 81
#note I literally drained my clock from something like 20 to 13 here thinking whether NONGUILT is good. I eventually chickened out. Of course it's good. I should have played it right away instead of doubt myself.
>Darrell_Day: ?ADEILL K3 dALLIED +69 193
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EFPRUY L2 FEY +29 110
#note Another missed bingo. REPURIFY is definitely common, but would have never popped into my head over the board. This is still a glaring weakness for me.
>Darrell_Day: ACDNRSU 15B UNSCAR.D +62 255
>Darrell_Day: ACDNRSU --  -62 193
>Siddharth_Murali: ?DINPTU 15B UNPiTI.D +63 173
#note Gotta play here, I think. I missed PUNDITIc though. One of these games where I make multiple bingo mistakes that deny me from advancing to the 1800-1900 level.
>Darrell_Day: ACDNRSU J9 RA.D +21 214
#note But Darrell has better plays here. CNSU isn't a great leave.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEORSST D4 OSSETRA +76 249
>Darrell_Day: CNU 8A CUN. +18 232
>Siddharth_Murali: ACEGNQV M3 VEGAN +36 285
#note Nooooo! I was deciding whether to play VEGAN or VEG here, and I wanted to play more tiles for the opportunity to save the Q. The drawback was improving the X's score from ~36 to ~52. However I missed a plethora of other candidates, such as GAVE, CAVE, and GANEV! Impressive board vision, Sid.
>Darrell_Day: OX N5 OX +53 285
#note Thankfully Darrell won this game, because I played quite miserably. But I still had a wild tournament. :)
>Siddharth_Murali: CHMOQSU O1 CHUMS +49 334
#note Another 'bleh' turn. I think I was right in this over QUA or QUASH, because this spot is far more dangerous. However, I missed both MUCHO and SCHMO.
>Darrell_Day: AEIRSTZ B6 AZ.RITES +71 356
>Siddharth_Murali: AGIOOQT 14G Q. +22 356
#note Just awful. Spaced out because of frustration. Basically I threw 20% on just this turn. I also had an awful 6th game against Darrell. Maybe he's just too intimidating :p
>Darrell_Day: EIORU A10 OURIE +15 371
>Siddharth_Murali: AEGIOOT 7B .O.A +17 373
#note Very low on time, threw away another 12.5%. This doesn't win at all.
>Darrell_Day: AELTWWY E10 YAWL +25 396
>Siddharth_Murali: EGIORT 4A GIR. +7 380
#note 9 seconds left- I thought I was blocking his outs.
>Darrell_Day: ETW F9 TEW +21 417
#note But he can play here. A very horribly botched game for me, let's see if this gets any better :)
>Darrell_Day:  (EOT) +6 423
