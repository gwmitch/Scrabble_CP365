#note I am bruce's kryptonite. unfortunately for him, this time I get to start with a blank.

>JD: CFHLLLS J7 F.LL +14 92
>Bruce_Ward: JNORUY M3 JOURN.Y +44 70
>JD: ACDHLOS N2 COD +24 116
#note I wanted to hold onto the S for sure because there are no other good wants to score on this board, already. Q likes COSH at N2 about as much, but I think keeping the S gives me better control.
>Bruce_Ward: CKO N8 .OCK +21 91
>JD: AAHLNQS 11J SHAN. +32 148
#note I liked the early defense offered by my play, especially since my leave sucks. Q slightly prefers LASH because I score better next turn, but I like this
>Bruce_Ward: EFI 10H FI.E +12 103
>JD: AELOQRT H10 .LORET +30 178
#note runs against the theme of what I've been doing, but too many points to pass up, and I can likely close next turn. Also, all I have to do is draw an I to have QI at 7G. quackle slightly prefers FOETAL or FOLATE, both of which give me easier Q plays (QUA or QAT)
>Bruce_Ward: AEU O3 EAU +19 122
>JD: AABEMQW G12 WAB +21 199
#note should've played WAME here, because that way I permanently block the T. He's never going to be that likely to bingo using the T, but now I have to worry about it for the rest of the game. I wanted to keep an E for some reason. but given that I have the Q, drawing an extra tile (5 Ts left!!!) gives me a better shot at QAT, which is basically my best case scenario.

>Bruce_Ward: DMOOZ C3 ZOOM.D +36 218
>JD: AEIMTUV 4C .UTVIE +20 257
#note I gave up a lot of points to make this play, but I felt like the UV combo was going to slow me down in future turns, and I liked drawing for one of the useful esses given the nice spot at O11.
>Bruce_Ward: EEHT B5 TH.EE +36 254
>JD: ADIMNOT A8 MANTID +50 307
#note I played MANTID because 4 Is left to draw. quackle says about even with MANITO or MONAD.
>Bruce_Ward: EINPRSU H1 PUR. +18 272
#note I got off very lucky here, because he had UNRIPEST and only thought of PRUNIEST*...hence why WAME in the first place.
>JD: BDEGINO E2 BE.ID.NG +24 331
#note I liked my play (which does not show up in the top 15 on static, but ends the game and also blocks the lanes on row 1 and 2) but quackle comes up with a play that is much superior: ROCKING at N8, which most importantly blocks S plays on column O, and also blocks bingos starting in T as a bonus.
>Bruce_Ward: AEIINOS F14 OI +11 283
#note bruce's actual rack, quackle suggests he has a real chance of winning but shouldn't block potential -EST bingos for himself. Q likes AI at F1, but I think that will make my blocking play too easy - perhaps RIA or RAI?
>JD: AGNOSTV O11 STANG +34 365
#note the wrong play, because I failed to identify the possibility of bingo sstarting at D9, which allows for a 4/36 threat if I draw IS out of the bag...I was blocking TENIASIS, but in fact I believe I can do both at once by playing VISTA at 15D, with no other major threats to outrun.
>Bruce_Ward: AEINSWY 14A SWAY +30 313
#note of course, in this particular universe, it turns out that Bruce HAS one the rack that beats me, and also missed his bingo and/or lane!! lucky me...
>JD: IOSV L11 .VISO +18 383
#note I went over by a minute.
