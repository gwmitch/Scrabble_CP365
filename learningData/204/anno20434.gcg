>Maureen_Morris: DFIO 8E FIDO +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLNUX E8 .LUX +28 28
#note Or FAUX, it's a toss-up in the sim. There's a single three-letter extension for FLUX to reach the upper DWS. I think I've seen it before but I guess it didn't stick in my mind.
>Maureen_Morris: DEO 7G ODE +13 29
>Matthew_Larocque: ABBEGNU 6G BUB +21 49
#note CONFLUX, which is likely to stay open after this play. But never mind that, BUGBANE would have been a huge play here! BABU is also probably better.
>Maureen_Morris: EIRT F10 TIRE +19 48
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIKNN 12F .ANKING +26 75
#note This throws a huge S-hook out in the open, something KNEEING doesn't do while scoring 30 points.
>Maureen_Morris: AEPT 11J PEA +21 69
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEERSU 14B UREiDES +82 157
#note There is one bingo here scoring 83, and I should have saw it, but UREiDES jumped out and it didn't seem like there would be anything better.
>Maureen_Morris: ACT C12 CA.T +12 81
>Matthew_Larocque: EEENOOZ 15H OOZE +45 202
#note bURSEED last turn. I figured keeping the N was better than playing OZONE here. Sim concurs.
>Maureen_Morris: AAMN 14K MANA +16 97
#note For some reason I thought this did not take an S (MANUS-MANA? Different words). But I did know MANAT which I was hoping she did not.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHILNO 13L HELO +28 230
#note Almost played HOLE but this small change makes a big difference. But it still allows her to score big with a short play. Q likes J2 HELIO. That's a little bit cocky.
>Maureen_Morris: INV O10 VIN. +8 105
#note Dodged a bullet, and she's also putting a V in bad spot for only 8 points. Less work for me!
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEHINW 12A WI.H +32 262
>Maureen_Morris: MO -  +0 105
#note The age-old question of which witch is.... wich?
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEENU 11D E..NE +21 283
#note It's 21 points on dying board, something she probably won't be able to get next turn. 
>Maureen_Morris: MO 15N MO +17 122
>Matthew_Larocque: AAETUVW M9 VAT +16 299
#note Good time to draw the V.
>Maureen_Morris: ?IQST J2 QuITS +45 167
#note Cutting her losses. After QIS she's going to have a hard time getting a bingo anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILUW 2J .UAIL +28 327
#note This was a dangerous play, but a lack of scoring options made me feel that it still made the most sense. Except I neglected to play QUALE instead which does have an S-hook.
>Maureen_Morris: EPSY O1 ESPY +54 221
#note Wasn't expecting that!
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIRRRW L1 W.RIER +26 353
#note My main focus now was playing off letters to end the game....
>Maureen_Morris: JO 5H JO. +27 248
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGILRT 5H ...T.D +28 381
#note Heh.
>Maureen_Morris: AN 13I AN +15 263
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGGILR E13 F.G +11 392
#note Champ thinks GIL(L) gives her the hardest time, blocking her highest scoring plays.
>Maureen_Morris: CEORSTY A7 ESCRO. +33 296
#note She misses SCREWY which scores more and doesn't let me play out.
