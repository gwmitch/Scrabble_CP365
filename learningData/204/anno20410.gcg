>Whimberry: AINOR 8H NORIA +12 12
#note Whimberry is an AI opponent. Generally makes high-equity plays, but has no sense of board development.
>Carl: AEOSVWY M3 WAVEYS +44 44
#note I couldn't decide between this and WAVEY 7/9E. Quackle prefers to keep the S, but it's close.
>Whimberry: EIMORTZ L8 .MORTIZE +90 102
>Carl: AFINOOT L1 FOOT +31 75
>Whimberry: ACEEGNU 13G EUGEN.C +26 128
#note Is there a triple-triple here?
>Carl: ?AIINNS 1H SAIN.oIN +140 215
#note The only one!!
>Whimberry: AGLPRUW 15H UPGR.W +36 164
>Carl: ABCDEFT 9G CAF +26 241
#note Quackle prefers FAB, but I like what this does to the board, especially against an opponent that doesn't understand board control.

#note New word in TWL.

>Whimberry: ?EGJRSS 11A JER.S +32 282
>Carl: DEELNOV 3B DELVE +20 341
#note Nothing jumped out at me in this position. DELVE seemed like a good way to start shutting down the board permanently. Quackle's choice of ELEVONS E5 looks pretty good too. Maybe 3C LEVO?

#note ++++ I may be the first person to ever play that word. (Jan. 16, 2015)
>Whimberry: BIINQRU 8A QI +35 406
>Carl: EOY 6F YE +28 433
#note OY is one point better. Didn't see (BOW)E(L).
