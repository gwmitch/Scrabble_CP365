#note Normally a bit lame, but I wanted to avoid SPAR hooks and work my way into walling in Mike, so this is fine.

#note Wow, the beautiful 11A CONNED for 20 is available, and it just annihilates that side of the board. Definitely that on a do-over.

#note Did not want to long term restore the board with INDOW. Otherwise didn't know what to do. I figured it was to my advantage to knock out the E. But Quackle likes CONN a little more.

#note An OK effort, but I had no business letting HOARED stay on the board. I didn't take a picture of my final game against Darrell, but I will try to reconstruct it from scratch. In case I can't, know that it was one of the worst played games by me ever... I tried LIVIDEST* and challenged the valid CROZIERS. No shame in admitting.. I always play like crap against Darrell!
