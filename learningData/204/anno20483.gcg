>Chris_Cree: ADEEHP 8D HEAPED +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: DENPRVX E7 V.XED +32 32
#note I saw this and didn't look for much else.  It's either this or the same word at E5.  43% to win.
>Chris_Cree: KNU 10B KUN. +18 50
>Jim_Burlant: EGINOPR 7H PIROGEN +70 102
#note This or PERIGON in the same location are my only bingo options.  I chose this because this does not take the back S, and PERIGON does.  Q agrees - this is best.  66% to win.
>Chris_Cree: LOTV M3 VOLT. +16 66
>Jim_Burlant: EEGGLNN C9 L.NGE +14 116
#note No really strong plays available here.  Best is 4J LEGONG 20, which I didn't know.  6I GEN is also good, and this rounds out the podium.  68% to win.
>Chris_Cree: FIRTT 14B FRITT +27 93
>Jim_Burlant: EGINNRT H5 RE..NTING +63 179
#note I initially put down NITROGEN thinking it was going to hit a 2x2.  When I saw it stopped at K10 and opened the S hook, I had second thoughts about it.  He'd just drawn 5, and I thought for sure that with SSSS unseen he was bound to have at least one of them.  I   didn't want him getting cheap points with something like ZAS.  What about row 15, you ask?  Unless he has the lone F or a bingo, he'll need to bingo to really kill me there.  Q says I should just man up and play NITROGEN.  YMMV.
>Chris_Cree: ?ACEIOT 15F AChIOTE +79 172
#note Post-mortem, the play Chris realized he missed was ALOETIC in the same location; the 6 scoreboard points sacrificed with AChIOTE are secondary to the vowel placement issues that ALOETIC would not have created.
>Jim_Burlant: AMNOSUU 14J MUONS +40 219
#note If Chris had found ALOETIC on his previous turn, I wouldn't be scoring 40 here, that's for sure.  I saw this and didn't look further.  Q says less is more here, and that I should play 14I AMU for 25.  Championship Player says MANUS in the same location as this is slightly better - presumably because there are still 6 A's unseen as opposed to 4 O's.
>Chris_Cree: IQ G11 QI +24 196
>Jim_Burlant: ABCDHUW K4 CAH.W +26 245
#note I struggled with this turn, as the clunk overload was difficult for me to process.  It took me minutes to find even this, and I had this annoying feeling I'd missed a better play somewhere.  As I entered the rack in Quackle, I didn't even need to look at the kibbitzer to see the play I whiffed on during the game:   WAUGH L4 scores 46 and is clearly best.  This choice gets honorable mention, but that's a smokescreen.  I really needed to find WAUGH here.  WAUGH defends equally well, unloads both the U and W, and...oh yeah... scores 20 more points.
>Chris_Cree: FOY 12A FO.Y +30 226
>Jim_Burlant: ABDELRU 13L DAUB +24 269
#note Considered INDURABLE* but wasn't sure enough about it to try it; I figured one 9 in a game was enough and that I shouldn't press my luck.  (The only legitimate 9 in ABDEILNRU is UNRIDEABLE, btw.)  As for quackle, the sim and championship player disagree with each other.  The sim says BECLOUD for 28 on row 2 is the star play.  Championship Player says this is best.  Despite the previous turn's misfire I'm still in excellent shape:  72% to win.
>Chris_Cree: AJOW 5D JOWA. +30 256
>Jim_Burlant: EILMORZ 4K .R.ZE +34 303
#note In a friendly game with Paul Holser a few months back, he challenged one of my 5-letter Z words.  For the life of me, I couldn't remember if it was CLOZE or GLOZE or some phony 5 ending in OZE.  And I couldn't remember if my word was good and he lost the challenge, or if my word came off. That injected juuuust enough doubt about CLOZE that I opted for CROZE, which I was 100% sure of.  If I'm 100% certain of it, CLOZE is better here due to leave.
>Chris_Cree: BDEL O1 BLE.D +24 280
>Jim_Burlant: AEILMOY 15A YA +20 323
#note Q doesn't like this, but I had my reasons.  Chris told me post-mortem that he had a 3  (RAS?) ready to go and I wanted to stop that.   I had also considered ZEIN but didn't want to give him an easy SO or SI for 20+ with those S's.
>Chris_Cree: AT D3 TA. +20 300
>Jim_Burlant: EILMORU 3D .UMOR +8 331
#note Playing conservatively.  I realize I'm throwing points away, but anything that scores more like OUTLIE at 3B gives him open lines with the blank unseen.  There are potential bingos through the T on row 3 (InTARSIA with the blank) but I don't see anything from the T on row 10, so I'll block this.  Worst case we trade 8 for 9, which I can afford.
