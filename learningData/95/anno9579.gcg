>Jackson: HINNORS 8G HON +12 12
#note Battle of the youngsters... 

I considered rhino, but the score wasn't great enough to sacrifice the nice INRS leave. I didn't even see NOH. 
>Quackle: GILPSTW J5 TWIG +24 24
#note Quackle agrees.
>Jackson: AINNRSY 9F NAY +18 30
#note Quackle agrees.
>Quackle: DELOPST 10D PLOD +20 44
#note Quackle likes POD best.
>Jackson: EIMNRST 11F REMINTS +79 109
>Quackle: AEIRSST 5E STRIA.ES +82 126
#note Quackle agrees.
>Jackson: AABDEKY H11 .AYBE +39 148
#note I saw beaky on my rack, but didn't see any place to put it... Quackle likes MAYBE second, next to BEAKY.
>Quackle: DEGLOTU H1 TOLU.D +24 150
#note Quackle ranks TOLUID 4th, after PUTLOG, EULOGY, and GLUEPOT.
>Jackson: AADEEKR 10I KAE +21 169
#note Quackle likes KEA, KAE, and PEAKED equally, with a valuation of 31.9.
>Quackle: CEEGIIT L3 GE.TIC +24 174
#note Quackle likes EPIGEIC best. GESTIC ranks second.
>Jackson: ADEEJNR D8 JA.ED +46 215
#note Quackle agrees.
>Quackle: EHILNNO 8L .HON +27 201
#note Quackle agrees.
>Jackson: EEENORR 9M ERE +14 229
#note Quackle agrees. Q valuates a leave of ENOR 0.2 better than EENR.
>Quackle: AEILNSV 15A VASELIN. +86 287
#note Quackle agrees.
>Jackson: ?ELNORU 1A ROUNdLE. +74 303
#note Quackle agrees. The second best move is TURNsOLE, underscoring ROUNdLET by 3.
>Quackle: IORTUWZ C11 WIZ +38 325
#note Quackle likes OUTROW (34) best. It keeps the IZ for a large play next turn (BIZ probably). With a blank out, I would be most inclined to play OUZO. It puts him up 17 on a closed board. WIZ ranks second according to Quackle.
>Jackson: ?ACEEFM 14D FEM +31 334
#note Just as i'm typing these words out, I notice FEM and FEME fit parallel to the ASEL in VASELINE. Aargh! Aarrgh! Aarrghh!. I also missed F(OR)CEMEAt. I gotta learn those darn low-prob 9s...
>Quackle: FGIORTU 4A FUGIO +28 353
#note Quackle agrees. I'm not sure if I do. With a blank unseen, FUGIO underneath STRIATES maybe be the better play. It blocks the largest bingo-lane (parallel to the WI in WIZ). Although scoring 3 fewer points than FUGIO and OS, I think it's the more strategically sound play. Another consideration is FOG (B10).
>Jackson: ?ACDEOP B6 POAChED +78 412
#note Out of the words I know, POAChED is best.
>Quackle: ABORRTX 3L .ROT +10 363
#note Mack made a really smart play here. GROT opens me up for QAT. After playing QAT, he can go out with BORAX. Although I could've blocked his 68-point outplay, I worried that he would pull some exotic word from his brain and go out, sticking me with the Q. Playing QAT and letting him go out with BORAX seemed like the safest possibility. Although it didn't win, I consider GROT to be a stellar play.
>Jackson: AIIQUV O1 QA. +36 448
#note Oh wow VITA didn't even occur to me.... Ugh.
>Quackle: ABRX N2 B.RAX +68 431
#note Note: this is the first time I've ever beaten Mack.
>Quackle:  (IIUV) +14 445
