>Curtis_Kowalski: EEIPTT 8D PETITE +22 22
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIILN H8 .ImELINE +74 74
#note I'm glad I didn't let the duplicates distract me from finding a bingo. There's actually a lot, this one scores the most though. Lucky, because I didn't know some of the other words including the anagrams of TIMELINE: MELINITE/ILMENITE.
>Curtis_Kowalski: FI I12 IF +20 42
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IIRRSS D8 .RISSIeR +70 144
#note Again, the triple duplicates make this rack look hopeless, but was able to find the diamond in the rough. Well ok these letters aren't really that bad! I didn't notice that I could make the blank a P and hook this word onto IF - that's a lot more defensive with no point sacrifice.
>Curtis_Kowalski: COZ 10B ZO.C +35 77
>Matthew_Larocque: BFIOPTY J10 YIP +21 165
#note Quackle hates this because the leave totally doesn't mesh. Curtis was setting himself up and I didn't see a good way to block it - so I set up my own hotspot to make a big F play making (LIP)E or (LIP)A. BIOTYP(E) is a good rack clearer though and PI(e)TY takes the point crown. Still, I don't think my play was completely horrible with 17 of the letters A or E in the bag.
>Curtis_Kowalski: AQRTU A8 QUART +61 138
#note Ouch, I didn't expect him to destroy it that badly.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDFNOT K11 FAB +32 197
#note Cool, FANTOD.
>Curtis_Kowalski: ADEEGNT 7I AGENTED +64 202
#note Now we have a game!
>Matthew_Larocque: DINOTXY O7 .OXY +45 242
#note Didn't see OXY for 50 - I'm pretty sure this has to be better though. Leaving that thing open is suicide.
>Curtis_Kowalski: BEHOOV N1 BEHOOV. +46 248
#note Awesome play - and it can play parallel to DOXY too!
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGINST K1 INGEST.D +70 312
#note lol I forgot about nidgets. I didn't know SIGNETED. I'm just really lucky that the only bingos I find this game end up simulating best or near-best.
>Curtis_Kowalski: AEER 13A AER.E +25 273
#note Phony #1. I held, I knew QUARTO and QUANTA and assumed he confused the two. But I had a killer play ready to go and I was only about 75% sure this was phony. I was leading so I thought I could safely leave it.
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEKOW M1 AWED +38 350
#note It's tough when you have a million and one ways to score 30 odd points. I briefly considered AWAKE N10, but this corner was too juicy to leave untouched. I should probably be more concerned about that completely exposed S, but 38 points is 38 points. Quackle has this simulating the highest with AWAKE right behind and AWOKE virtually tied.
>Curtis_Kowalski: AW 9M WA. +17 290
#note Getting fishy now...
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAKNOU O1 AN +27 377
#note This was a big mistake. I was patient earlier but now I'm rushing and not looking at the whole board. I kind of knee-jerked this down just so he couldn't fish for easy points. KOA G13 is loads better, AUK 7E kills that AE bingo hook, and I don't know what an ANORAK is.
>Curtis_Kowalski: NOORTU M9 .ORNOUT +20 310
#note The second phony. This one isn't even a good phony. In fact I deserve to lose this game just for leaving it on the board. But, I saw H(O)M(Y) and decided to take the hotspot he created. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AAHKMOU 10L H.M. +28 405
#note The problem with that logic is that H(O)M(Y) is terrible. There's a crapload of plays that score well, dump the K and the U, and block bingo lanes. Basically, I got really lazy and played bad. I mean, I even saw the word KHOUM, saw I could dump it to the S, but not for 27 points just below. I am not joking. HA(i)KU for 30 is wicked too.What's an OAKUM.
>Curtis_Kowalski: CDLU 1G DULC. +24 334
#note This is also phony, but I wasn't sure at all. Thought maybe it was a weird plural for DULCET, or short for DULCIMER.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGJKOU 3I JU. +19 424
#note Holy crap. I did spend a long time here, almost the remainder of my clock which was at like 9 minutes or something. I didn't want to emtpy the bag, so I wanted to play JU off somewhere. Not JU(N), I should at least block something. JU(S) blocks but doesn't score anything. Why didn't I play JU(T)? That blocks the 2 best lanes and scores 26. Geez! JOUK and JAUK 6F score 38 and kill those spots too. There's still the IN(G) thing left though. -_-
>Curtis_Kowalski: L B13 .L +4 338
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGKORS 15K KA.AS +30 454
#note Wow, he didn't bingo still. Without any time to spare I toss this down figuring he can't catch up to me now. Quackle says ARKOS(E) which Zyzzyva says is a type of sandstone is the best play, followed by KA G13. 
>Curtis_Kowalski: EILMNOV 2D MOVE +20 358
#note His best play is V(I)MEN G7 for 27.
>Matthew_Larocque: GOR 3C GOR +14 468
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ILN) +6 474
#note Scrabble is funny. This was my highest scoring game, but it had some of the most boneheaded decisions of the tournament. I also ended up with 484 instead of 474.... balances out my first game where my opponent was overscored by 10 also.
