>Mike_Early: CETUV --  -26 0
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEIUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note Always nice when your opponent opens with something you're 100% sure is phony.  This is best, with nothing else simming within 5 points; not even 8D CAWED is worth the extra points.
>Mike_Early: CETUV 9F VET +15 15
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEIPU 7E CUE +13 27
#note Giving Quackle the proverbial middle finger.  I saw 7G APIECE and didn't like the board position, and I absolutely wanted to unload the U at all costs.   Given that mike had just exchanged, I didn't mind trading points to groom the rack a little more than any of the other choices allowed me to.  Q prefers EPIC 7G; this play is mid pack, roughly 5 points down.  
>Mike_Early: CEJNOUZ E3 JOUN.E +30 45
#note Mike told me post-mortem that this was his rack.  Q agrees with his choice, with JUDO I6 simming 2-1/2 pts down, and E4 JUNCO roughly 1 point down on JUDO.  My choice would have been JUNCO; I'm a little surprised Q wouldn't want him to keep his E.
>Jim_Burlant: ??AAEIP D8 APAtItE +69 96
#note Luckbox!  THis choice exemplifies the curse of having 2 blanks *and* duplicated tiles in the same rack, where more often than not it's a matter of what I can find.  PAEsAnI, PAtInAE or PArEIrA would have been better choices. One other factor was in play:  Mike has been playing at warp speed these days, and I was consciously not wanting to burn 8 minutes off my clock to find 8 more points.   Against someone else I might have put more time in and maybe I would have found one of the better choices (no excuse for me not to find PAtInAE or PAEsAnI).  I felt that after a couple of minutes, I had to fish or cut bait so I just said, 'Screw it" and put this down.
>Mike_Early: DIOZ 4D Z.OID +34 79
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIINN 11D .ENIA +8 104
#note No good options available; E11 INANE 17 is the sim winner, and the rest of the choices score between 8 and 12.  This sims roughly 4-1/2 points down on INANE.
>Mike_Early: BIST 15A BITS +30 109
>Jim_Burlant: EGHINOT 12H HONGI +35 139
#note This rack looks like there should be something in it, but there are no 7's and the only 8 that can be made from it requires an S.  Three plays, of which this is one, sime within 2 points of each other at the top of the heap.  The other two are H11 AHING  and I8 DO.  
>Mike_Early: FINRY K7 FRYIN. +26 135
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHQST 3G QAT +47 186
#note BAD miss - playing rushed due to Mike's fast play.  QANAT J10 scores 69.  However, I get bailed out of my mistake.
>Mike_Early: ACEIMSU 2H CAESIUM +84 219
#note Strong play, but this isn't Mike's best choice:  AUtECISM 13B scores 93.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEHIRS 1B HARDIES +107 293
#note O2 plays "only" score 98.  This is best.
>Mike_Early: ILOY 8K .OILY +27 246
>Jim_Burlant: AAFLRWX 13G WAX +48 341
#note Blind to J10 again.  Any number of strong choices; apparently I should just take the points with J9 AX for 55.
>Mike_Early: LOV L1 V.OL +22 268
>Jim_Burlant: AFLNORS 2A FOR +24 365
#note Really?  Play my N and keep my R with three unseen R's?  No thanks.  Q prefers 2A FON by nearly 2 points.  Q also likes 5J FLAN.
>Mike_Early: BE J10 BE. +23 291
>Jim_Burlant: AGKLNNS M7 K.NG +15 380
#note More worried about defense than scoring.  5K LANG or LANK are the sim winners.  I was more concerned about shutting down his bingo opportunities.
>Mike_Early: OPT 14I OPT +21 312

>Jim_Burlant: ADEEELS 5I EASELED +74 477
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEELS --  -74 403
#note Wishful thinking induced dyslexia:  I thought I was making VOILE when I put this down.  Whoops.  Best sequence here is actually quite clever:  SEE 6L folloowed by 5J LEAD to make LEAD/VIOLAS/DEKING.
