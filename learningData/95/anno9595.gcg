#note Mildly surprised that Q thinks the 8F placement is as good as this choice (this choice wins the sim and the 8F placement sims within 0.3 points.  To me, the problem with playing at 8F is that it telegraphs that I've got the X.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AW G8 .AW +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: ACEHRTX H7 T.X +19 39
#note Bad mss - EXARCH H10 scores 62.  Next best play is H10 EX, which I seriously considered .  This is 4th best, but EXARCH was definitely the play.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEIINRS 11A BRINIES +82 96
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEFHR A11 .EACH +39 78
#note Not thrilled about having to keep the F, but  this is best.   BEECH in the same location sims 4 points down, and FEEB sims 1 point down on BEECH.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OR F9 RO. +22 118
>Jim_Burlant: EFHKRST J8 KEF +33 111
#note Another option worth consideration is c9 FRITH.  What made me choose this was the fact that, despite the consonant heavy leave, it set up my S.  Q agrees, preferring this by nearly 4-1/2 points over FRITH.  Despite my blunder of missing EXARCH, I'm back up to 47% winning chances.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEGRU K10 AGUE +15 133
#note Sam initially put down AGUE, pulled it up, put down RAG K9, pulled that up, and put this down.
>Jim_Burlant: HLMORST L11 OHM +33 144
#note At around 400 iterations, this play establishes itself as the best chioce; K4 HOLMS and L12 HM sim roughly 1 point down.  Despite the consonant overload, Q agrees with me that S is wortha  lot more than 3 points on this board.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IQ 10C QI +24 157
>Jim_Burlant: ADFLRST K3 DRAFTS +36 180
#note Not a bad play, but there was no need to pull the plug on the S.  I whiffed on 13I FREMD and D8 FLINT.  This is the bronze medalist, albeit at an 8-point deficiet to FREMD and FLINT, which are the two standouts.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AGRY D7 GRA..Y +22 179
>Jim_Burlant: BELLOPT M8 BLOT +11 191
#note I didn't like this play a whole lot but didn't see most of the better choices; I was getting tired of situations where I would struggle to draw an E and have to burn it just to score anything.  The best play is PETROL 4H.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEL J4 ALE +16 195
>Jim_Burlant: ?EELPRV L2 VEEP +32 223
#note How many of you out there know the 7 in this rack?   As bingo misses go, this is pretty benign; this is the best non-bingo option and it barely concedes 13 points in the sim despite conceding 47 points on the scoreboard to the bingo of REPLEVy.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EINRT 5E INTER... +20 215
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEILR N4 LIpREAD +74 297
#note Bad miss.  HARDLINE scores 89 at 15A and is much better defensivly than this.  This still wins 89%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ILOS O1 SILO +18 233
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACDGOU 8A GUA.D +21 318
#note Couldn't think of GOURD.  Having said that, H1 COUDE is definitely best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEY O8 DYE +49 282
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEINOO 4A COONtIE +77 395
#note At least I had to make one good decision this game.  COOEEING A1 scores 83 but needlessly opens up a bunch of lines.  This is by far the best choice and the sim agrees.
