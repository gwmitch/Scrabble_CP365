>Jim_Burlant: BEGILOS 8C OBLIGES +76 76
#note Q likes this best, preferring this by 3 points over the 8H placement.  Even not knowing his rack, I should have played for 74 at 8H due to vowel placement.  Having said that, in this game this was a 35-point mistake.  
>Orry_Swift: AADOPY E5 PAY.OAD +52 52
>Jim_Burlant: ADELOOW F10 WOO +30 106
#note  Considered LEADWOOD*, but discretion was the better part of valor and I chickened out on it.  I normally don't like leaving easy back hooks open.  But between a nice balanced ADEL leave that leaves two semi low probability back hooks for WOO in my rack, I couldn't resist this.   Q agrees, preferring this by a handful of points over WOOED in the same location.
>Orry_Swift: ?EGOOTT I1 GrOTTOE. +60 112
#note Best play and only bingo for Orry - even with the cruddy board position, he doesn't have any other options that score enough for him to justify passing up the bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AADELNO 1E ALON. +18 124
#note Now I start struggling, and I miss any number of good plays.  All I could see was DANGLE, and it didn't seem like it scored enough to justify blowing up the rack.  Any number of common words (AGENDA, anybody?) would have worked, but I couldn't find them.  1D ANALOG wins 52%, AGENDA wins just under that.  This is poor.
>Orry_Swift: ATUV D10 VATU +27 139
>Jim_Burlant: ABDELQU F3 QUAD +29 153
#note Q prefers D4 QUA by roughly 2 points.  I didn't like giving up the easy A hooks.  I'm still 49% to win.  
>Orry_Swift: DIITX C11 DIXIT +52 191
#note Ouch!  Orry is winning 60% in a short sim, and now my brain goes dead.
>Jim_Burlant: BCEEILT 3I .LEIC +14 167
#note For reasons I cannot comprehend now, I didn't like 15A BITE.  Either that or BETEL was right. No really good options available, but that's no excuse.  This play sucks.
>Orry_Swift: EEHIR 15A EI.HER +39 230
>Jim_Burlant: BCEEINS 6I .BE +11 178
#note Nothing really great available; Q prefers 2I REB and 14E BE.  14E BE didn't appeal to me because of what it did to the board.  I felt I was closing in on something and that another line for an 8 could only help me.  What's the worst that could happen here?
>Orry_Swift: ?EFIIMN K5 F.MINIzE +98 328
#note I think we have our answer.
>Jim_Burlant: CEINRSW 2B CREW +23 201
#note Q doesn't like this at all, but it's not like it makes much difference at this point.  Best play wins 0.94% to this play's 0.45.

>Orry_Swift: DHU 13K DUH +28 404
>Jim_Burlant: AELMSTY 9B MY +20 305
#note Missed a cool play here:  ASININELY A1 36.  Apparently L2 LIMEY is best.   This is mid pack.
>Orry_Swift: R 6D R.. +4 408
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLPST 14L PEG +21 326
#note #note Seeing Orry fish off an R made me think he was getting ready to bingo at H8, so I thought I should open another line and set up an S hook. Q prefers 7C GEY. What does Q know that I don't?
>Orry_Swift: JNO 7A .NJO. +49 457
#note Orry's play of ROB looked like a bingo fish, but in reality it was a setup for his J.  Terrific bit of misdirection on his end; tip of the hat to you, Orry.  Play incorrectly scored as 50.
>Jim_Burlant: AAELSTZ O12 ZEST +76 402
#note My gut says that if I played well - which I did not in this game - I still would have lost by 30 - 40, as I had too many racks without options to counter his nonstop stream of huge plays.  Post-mortem, when I asked Orry what he would have done had I made the better play in a couple of positions,  (e.g., BITE instead of OLEIC), he still would have had 30+ coming back while I would have had yet another rack that couldn't score 20.  But you just cannot make as many mistakes as I did this game and get away with it against a player of Orry's caliber.
