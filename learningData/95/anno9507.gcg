>Matthew_Larocque: CEFIORW H4 COWIER +28 28
>Risa_Horowitz: ?ALNSTY G8 NASTiLY +66 66
#note There is one double-double with her rack here, and a few other words that score 74. This is pretty defensive though unless I have something like FOES on my rack.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHIIKO 4H .HOKE +28 56
#note I was pretty stuck here. FIE H12 has a longshot chance of backfiring, but KIEF I9 works a lot better than my play. I like KOI there too.
>Risa_Horowitz: AQT F7 QAT +18 84
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIIIU 5K IF +27 83
#note Lol. This is so bad, but I thought why not take 27 points now and exchange next turn if I really don't have anything that scores.
>Risa_Horowitz: ?BEORST 11D BOo.REST +86 170
#note I held her play for awhile. I saw other words like SORBETS BLOTTERS BOTTLERS, and I was really on the fence with this word she played. Since I'm passing my turn to exchange, she was getting a bingo no matter what. So, seemed logical not to risk anything here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIIU -AEIIIU +0 83
>Risa_Horowitz: APR 12C RAP +22 192
>Matthew_Larocque: AACDEIO B12 CIAO +20 103
#note The exchange didn't improve my rack very much. Time to get insane! This sims bad, but seriousy. When you have like a 5% chance to win, you need to set up some crazy stuff to get back in it. DIOEC(Y) is cool though.
>Risa_Horowitz: ANN 15A N.NA +15 207
#note Phew... she slowed down a bit.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEGLS M1 GELD +28 131
#note Put down G(I)ED at first but that kills my hook duh. Maybe I should have just played GED, that's even more insane than CIAO! Forgot about GAED, there's lots of EEEEs left.
>Risa_Horowitz: ILMNOT 1G MOLTIN. +33 240
#note Argh. Or is this play actually a blessing in disguise?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEEES -AEEEE +0 131
#note I never had any momentum in the first place, but this had to be the death knell. I'm getting steamrolled like fresh pavement. Buried at the bottom of the sea. Quackle gives me just over a 3% shot for keeping AES and just under 3% for keeping just ES. I'd have to draw the most outrageous rack imaginable to swing the game in my favour after trailing by like 120ish points.
>Risa_Horowitz: AIV 10B VIA +19 259
#note Yup.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEMOSU F14 MU +23 154
#note According to Quackle, my play has a 1.6% chance to claim victory. EMU was probably better, but it doesn't really matter at this point. 

*draws 2 tiles*
>Risa_Horowitz: GGINTUW -GUW +0 259
#note She told me her rack here. She didn't like any of the plays, so she exchanged WUG. TUG 6L would be stupid. In reality (M)UG is the only right play here. Because.....
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEORSX 2B REDOXES +118 272
#note *Draws the most outrageous rack imaginable*

One hundred and eighteen.

*Hits clock*


>Risa_Horowitz: GHINT 12I THING +27 286
>Matthew_Larocque: EJLOUUV 1A JO +29 301
#note I thought for a long time about wether to play JO, J(O)ULE, or (O)VULE. I figured I should take the points and hope that I can play (O)VULE next turn. The best play is VUL(G)O but I don't know what that is.
>Risa_Horowitz: DEO 3C DOE +19 305
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLUUVW M10 VU.G +18 319
#note Wow this is all kinds of ugly. Since there's no place to phony with VUGWULE, this play dumps and blocks. WUSHU is a funny sounding word.
>Risa_Horowitz: EYZ D2 ..ZEY +36 341
#note Dammit. I was 90% sure this was garbage. But if I can pull out a win with a 1.6% chance, I can lose a challenge with a 10% chance. Time to ignore possible phonies and keep scoring!
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFLSUW E5 FE +25 344
#note I did see FEW 6L, but I think I wanted to keep the W to score with next turn? Q likes (JO)W for 20. I like FU(E)L for 21.
>Risa_Horowitz: IU I11 ..UI +5 346
#note Wow what.....
>Matthew_Larocque: ELPRSUW 15I SPEW +18 362
#note That last play really had me wondering. I was getting dangerously close to overtime so bleh.... I wanted to save my S for VUGG but it was more important to end the game before I lost from a time penatly. Quackle wants me to play PLU(SH) or (JO)W or UP 6J.
>Risa_Horowitz: AE C6 AE +9 355
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDLRRU J3 L.RD +15 377
#note Quackle says (O)RB edges this out in valuation, but that 6 plays clinch the game here.
>Risa_Horowitz: AEIINT 6G A.E. +8 363
#note She ran slightly into overtime, so I wouldn't blame her for not seeing INI(TI)AT(E). I ended up bailing her out with my next play though.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABRU J8 BRU.. +12 389
#note AB 9C. RUBA(TI) to go out too! Have to deny her BINIT but you need time to figure crap like that out. My mind was wiped after this game.
>Risa_Horowitz: IINT 8J .INIT +8 371
>Risa_Horowitz:  (A) +2 373
#note Crazy game.... and the rematches didn't dissapoint either!
