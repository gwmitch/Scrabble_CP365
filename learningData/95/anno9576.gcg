#note desperately need to bingo. Gotta open it up.

#note Nice block
>Tunnicliffe: ACCEHOS J11 OE +8 313
#note In hindsight, I would play something else.
>oppo: GLLRRRT -RRRLLGT +0 360
#note This is a key turn. My opponent actually draws NINE tiles on the exchange here. I flipped over RAZE on the overdraw procedure and threw AE to the bag. That would be key later on.
>Tunnicliffe: ACCHOSS -CS +0 313
#note Need to bingo and it isn't going to happen with these tiles. Gotta trade here. Keeping ACHOS seems solid since I can score even if I don't bingo. Tossing CS into the bag.

#note Teehee, well, it's plausible!
>Tunnicliffe: ?ACHIOS -IO +0 313
#note Yes! The blank! But I still can't bingo. So tradesies again, I guess. Gonna ditch the clunky vowels and see where ACHS? takes me. Bye bye, IO.

#note Short for CONGRATS! But not in the dictionary, unfortunately. Anyways, see if you can figure out what my next play is going to be. It's a doozy!
