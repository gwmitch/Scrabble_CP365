#note Champ 2-ply says D12 DEKE 43.  Saw it, didn't like leaving ABJ.  Missed the E hook on TING, so JE(E)D seemed to make sense.  Champ says it's 4th.

#note Nice!  (I always miss this alphagram.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEKRST A1 KAB +34 243
#note Figured it'd be between KAB and S(Y)KE (if I was sure of the S hook there, which I was... almost).  I felt like I needed to bingo soon to keep up with her, so this would help to that end.  SYKE wins with Champ 2-ply.  TEAK for 47 is 3rd.
