>scott_jackson: AEORSTV 1A OVE. +21 184
#note I was trying to keep my rack as intact as possible, but didn't see 15E VOTE. I figured I was just about guaranteed to get the extension if he didn't make one on his next turn. A13 TAV is another good option.
>steve_pellinen: DEILLOR 1A ....ROLLED +42 207
#note I thought OVERROLL was good, and the more I said it afterwards the more I realized it didn't make any sense. Several bingos available: ARILLODE, LORDLIER, TROLLIED.

#note best
>steve_pellinen: IIJLQUU 2J ULU +14 308
#note sims best despite given up both U's while retaining the Q. I assume this is because of cases where I don't play in the top right.
>scott_jackson: CDEFGIV L1 F.CI +26 367
#note best. considerd FUDGE but didn't like setting up a big 2x2 lane. 
>steve_pellinen: IIJOQSU 1L .UJI +42 350
#note haha
>scott_jackson: DO 2N OD +27 394
#note forgot to write down my rack here
>steve_pellinen: ?IMOQSZ K4 QI +33 383
#note Quackle prefers K4 QuIZ by a considerable margin. 
>scott_jackson: DEEGNNV B6 GENE +26 420
#note If I want to leave one tile in the bag Quackle prefers DENE instead, I assume because I have a decent chance of drawing an I. 
>steve_pellinen: ?EIMOSZ O1 ..OlIZES +51 434
#note Way better than anything CP suggests at 90%+. I thought for sure I had this won since I couldn't see any playable bingos and only one spot to put the Z. 
>scott_jackson: ADEINPV N7 PAVED +19 439
#note I didn't realize he had a B instead of an O, otherwise I could have lost myself the game had I stuck an A or I out there. Best play is the cute 8M ENS/EDS setting up an unblockable PAVID at L8. My move is nine points worse in terms of valuation.
