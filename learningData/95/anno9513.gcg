#note Sims okay.  3rd.  7G VOE or HOE are what Q likes, but I can't see my rack going anywhere good with that junk.  EHIOU seemed like it could bail me out a bit faster than anything else, and as close as this game is, I need to keep up.

#note Held and released.  Phew.
>Ryan_Fischer: HILNOUZ A2 .UZIL +27 344
#note Champ says OH or HUN before this.  Pete had awesome idea of suggesting I hold UZIL and fish for (TEXT)UALIZE*.  I thought it was brilliant, but I don't study 4-to-10 extensions. :)  It's not good, surprisingly.  I figured I'd balance my rack and hope to hit N10 hard next turn if Pete can't.

#note I figure I can't really play (Z)ORIL and allow him a chance at a bingo.  Champ thinks otherwise.  OLIO for 19 is an option with all those vowels.

#note Nowt much I coulda done there.  He's going out in multiple places.  Can't quite figure this one out.
