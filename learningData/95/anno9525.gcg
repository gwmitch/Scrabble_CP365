#note Q prefers FYCE F8 by not quite 2 points.   This is runner-up.
>Ben_Withers: EINNORU 7H REUNION +61 73
#note Best bingo for Ben.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEILS O2 LACIESt +91 108
#note Best bingo.  Other options:  H7 REPLICASE 89, and scads of 86-point 2x2's.
>Ben_Withers: AFGNU 2J FUNGA. +36 109
>Jim_Burlant: ?LMQRST N1 Q.T +14 122
#note Interesting sim result.  I'd have never guessed that I should burn the blank to play QUALM for 41, but that's what Quackle wants. Given how consonant-overloaded this rack is, maybe Q is right. I felt, at the time, it was too early to burn the blank for anything under 60 pts so QUALM didn't even occur to me.  Suggestions anyone?  I wanted to hold the blank and hope for a good draw.  Regardless of whether Quackle is right or this choice was - this is runner up, though it sims just over 6 points down to QUaLM at 1000 iterations - QUaLM would have prevented his next play.

#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ?AILMRS M6 M.RALISt +70 192
#note Took quite a while on this turn - I didn't think that the extra 5 points were worth slotting the 3x3 with an E9 bingo.  The rest of the options (including this one) all score 70, and they all sim within 1/2 point of each other.  Perhaps I shouldn't have opened up an S hook, though, and played AIRMAILS instead?
>Ben_Withers: ADIPR 1F PARDI +29 190
>Jim_Burlant: GHJKOTU 12I JOUK. +32 224
#note Close call - sim gives slight preference to L11 TOUGH, but the difference is style preference.  Maybe so, but TOUGH would have prevented his next play.
>Ben_Withers: EESZ 14J ZEES +43 233
>Jim_Burlant: GGHNPTV -GHPV +0 224
#note Q suggests playing through with G7 PIT/PIN.  Gotta admit I didn't see them, as I had been expecting to play VUGH until his play of ZEES blocked it.  Having said that, the GGHNV leave with PT is rather unappealing.  Anyway - except for PIT/PIN, the rest of the options are all exchanges. PIT wins 37%, exchanging wins 33.
>Ben_Withers: DEIORTU 2B OUTRIDE +81 314
>Jim_Burlant: ADGNTTW 15H TWAT +34 258
#note Best.   Nothing else worth consideration.  Barely alive, winning 8% in a short sim. 
>Ben_Withers: AGO K4 AGO. +20 334
>Jim_Burlant: DGHINPV C1 V.GH +22 280
#note As Yogi Berra would say, "It's like deja vu all over again."  Another one of those telltale signs you're having a bad tournament:  Barely 2 turns after exchanging, in a single draw you get back 3 of the 4 tiles you threw in.  Sim likes either this or K11 DUVET.  When I saw my next rack, I thought I still had a chance of getting back into the game.  His next rack rendered this game academic.
>Ben_Withers: ACEILST D4 ELASTIC +80 414
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINPR 14B PARDINE +76 356
#note Hopeless.  Even this - the best play and only bingo -  wins less than 1%.
>Ben_Withers: LNOO E4 NOLO +22 436
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEHRV D12 VE.B +24 380
#note Best valuation of any play in the pool per championship player.  CP claims C13 BAH allegedly wins 9% and that this wins 3.  Whatever.
>Ben_Withers: EMY 6B ME..Y +24 460
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEHRW 15A BAR. +30 410
#note Missing BARBED for 45, saving 21 points of spread.  Whoops.
