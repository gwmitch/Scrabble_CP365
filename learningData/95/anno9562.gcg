#note I knew UNKEND, but I thought UNKENT was phoney. Still, perhaps the ENT leave is good enough to compensate for the extra entropy.

#note Sacrificing points to keep a good rack (DUV(ET), V(E)T) is possible here, but the board doesn't seem conducive enough to bingos to warrant that. On the other hand, there are now a lot of hooks on the board that I can't currently touch. Still, this seems reasonable enough.

>whatnoloan: AEEINOR D12 AEON +20 124
#note I saw OAKEN, but not OAKIER or EIKON amidst the jumble. Quackle likes OE, which makes some sense, especially given the wide open T and M. AERO is also not bad. I'm not sure what the right play is here.
>Leesa: GIOW 15A OWI.G +27 171
>whatnoloan: AEEIORS 9C EO. +12 136
#note I saw ARIOSE here, but I liked going for a bingo at this point. I am not a huge fan of OAKIER.

#note What bingo would you have picked?

>whatnoloan: ABHINSV K3 BAH +30 247
#note This was a tough play. INSV just seems like a really poor leave. On the other hand, the S is good for some scores on this board. VIB(E) was another consideration. This seems alright though.
>Leesa: EEP 14L .EEP +29 272
>whatnoloan: AAINOSV B12 AVO. +20 267
#note AVION is good at scoring and opening, but I wasn't quite happy to play it.
>Leesa: IMPSW F2 WIMPS +37 309
#note Yikes! This really put me in jeopardy.
>whatnoloan: AEIINRS M4 ANI +16 283
#note I played this hastily, as I had eaten away a lot of my time the whole game. This seemed somewhat tough for her to deal with, at least. 
>Leesa: AGLO N6 LAG +11 320
#note Seems like a nice play to me!!
>whatnoloan: DEEEIRS G2 ED +15 298
#note I know she has the O, and I can't really do much about that. I figured my best action was to set up another spot and hope for some great tiles. Any better ideas? Perhaps something DE(M)E is called for since JX is out. Tough play.
>Leesa: FGI 1G FIG +28 348
#note She held neither of JX when she played this.
>whatnoloan: DEEIRSU O3 REUSE +12 310
#note Time to throw in the towel, and save some spread while I'm at it.
>Leesa: DIJLOXY E1 JOY +26 374
#note XYLOID is best.
>whatnoloan: DIT 14G DIT +6 316
#note I felt I should get 1122 points from her rack. :)
