#note wasn't sure what to do here, because I didn't see a way to clean up my rack but also block the two bottom rows if he had the blank. I also obviously needed to dump the R. I figured that there was a decent chance he couldn't bingo even with the blank. I don't know why this is second to TAV in the same spot when there are three R's unseen and no T's.
