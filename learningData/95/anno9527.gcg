>Jeff_Purinton: AGIV 8G VAGI +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: IKORRTZ J7 R.TZ +33 33
#note Best.  Despite the lead, only winning 47%.
>Jeff_Purinton: DGN H7 D.NG +6 22
>Jim_Burlant: AIKMNOR K10 AMOK +31 64
#note Best.  Next best choice is OAK K9 27, simming nearly 4-1/2 points down.
>Jeff_Purinton: CGI L8 CIG +22 44
>Jim_Burlant: BCILNOR 12H BIC.RN +26 90
#note Couldn't think of 12F BICOLOR, which is best.  This isn't awful, but it's roughly a 5-point dog to BICOLOR.  Other options are BORONIC, CIBOL, BROCOLI, all on row 12.  Small consolation:  none of them would have prevented his next play.  I'm winning 61%, but not for long.
>Jeff_Purinton: AEIRRST 13C TARRIES +75 119
#note Best bingo for Jeff.  N column plays (TARSIER N9, N9 ARTSIER) and 14H TARSIER score 79 but they give up too much on the triple lines.
>Jim_Burlant: LMOOSUW 8L .OWL +27 117
#note Or CULM or 14K SWUM.  Regardless, given my next draw it wouldn't have mattered.  I'm winning 38%.
>Jeff_Purinton: EIOTUV K2 OUTVIE +20 139
>Jim_Burlant: IMOSUUU -OUUU +0 117
#note Yet another telltale sign of the kind of tournament I was having:  2 U's in the unseen pool vs 10 E's...and I draw both U's on a 3-tile pick.  Surprisingly, despite having to punt a turn, my winning chances haven't dropped that much.   I kept the M because it's a good rack balancer and, if the draw isn't bingo prone, I can score with it somewhere.   Q agrees:  this is the best exchange, and I'm still winning 34%.  
>Jeff_Purinton: EQY 3J Q.EY +32 171
>Jim_Burlant: IIMPRSS N2 ISM +27 144
#note Surprisingly, this choice sims very well - within 1 point and 0.8% winning chances of N3 SIMP 31, but I'm not so sure it isn't/wasn't a mistake.  N3 SIMP (the sim winner) looks right; it just didn't register to me that I could miss the N2 DW and still score.
>Jeff_Purinton: OW I6 WO. +14 185
>Jim_Burlant: DINPRST M7 P.DS +31 175
#note What's a guy gotta do to draw an E?  Wasn't initially sure whether to play the S, but the first order of business is to stay in the game.  S is otherwise useless on this board, so I'll take the points and hope for a good draw.  Q agrees - this is best, with H12 BEND 21 coming in second, roughly 2-1/2 points down in a short sim.  I'm still winning 31%.
>Jeff_Purinton: ADEILNT D6 DENTALI. +70 255
#note Best bingo for Jeff, and he's now winning 86%.  Play incorrectly scored as 68.
>Jim_Burlant: EHINRTX E5 HEX +38 213
#note I didn't like this play.  While the 38 points were too hard for me to resist at the time, this play makes it too easy for him to shut the board down; I should have looked harder to trade points for a more open board.  Q agrees with my analysis, as its preference is E10 XI; looks right.  
>Jeff_Purinton: JO 1N JO +40 295
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: AEINPRT 8A PAI. +18 231
#note This choice sims midpack; my concern, based on many online games against Jeff, was keeping the board alive.  4K TRAMP scores a lot more than this but I need bingo lines if I'm going to win this game.  This sims roughly 6 points down on H12 BEEP 24.
>Jeff_Purinton: AE 13K .EA +20 315
>Jim_Burlant: ENNRTUY 14L TYNE +23 254
#note This does terribly statically (towards the bottom of the heap) but does very well in the 2-ply sim.  While it gives up 7 equity to F3 TREY, this does a much better job keeping the board alive and sims as the silver medalist.
>Jeff_Purinton: AEHLO 15H HAOLE +32 347
#note Play incorrectly scored as 35.
>Jim_Burlant: ?BNORUU B5 RUN.BOUt +63 317
#note And I eventually find it.  Brings to mind something Mark Milan told Chris Patrick Morgan during his Albuquerque debacle of 2009:  [blank notwithstanding]..."Even when you bingo your tiles suck!"
>Jeff_Purinton: ILU O12 LI.U +15 362
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFNST F5 EF +33 350
#note DEF 6D apparently wins 1 in 8 (I'm assuming that I allegedly win if the blank is in the bag?).  I didn't see how I would bingo anywhere even if I did land the blank, so I didn't go for the improbable win.
>Jeff_Purinton: ?ADEFOR A12 AlEF +23 385
>Jim_Burlant: AEENST G3 SENT +19 369
#note Couldn't remember SATEEN, which plays at A1 and loses by 2.  While I didn't play perfectly, it's fair to say the draw also left me no margin for being anything short of Quackle.  There just 
wasn't much I could do about this.
