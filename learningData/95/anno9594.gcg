#note An aside - just how low-probability is a rack like this if I go first?  If an opening rack can give you a bad vibe about a game, this did it.  Was a tough call as to whether to turn tiles with ZING or play short with this. My own take was that, while the leave sucked, if he didn't have an I, S, or bingo through/to/from the two letters on the board, he couldn't score squat and anything he put down would have to open, or worst case I'd get a free exchange.   Q agrees - this is best. Exchange JMQZ sims a little more than 1 point down.

#note Ok, well, while he did have I's, he didn't score that outrageously, and now he's opened up for me.
>Jim_Burlant: AGJMNRZ E8 Z.NG +28 50
#note   E6 MAZING does the best job clearing the crap out of this rack, but it's way too much of a defensive liability.  MIRZA  scores 4 more points, but leaves me w/o vowels on a board that doesn't promise to have many vowels to play through.  Q says it's a tossup between this or MIRZA.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEIJMR B6 REJI. +15 65
#note When I saw the EEI draw I was feeling pretty good about this game and that maybe my good fortune was continuing.  Q likes 7H AJEE - yuck; I just didn't want to part with both my E's and give him a nice line to play through on the 2x2  This is one of the top 3 simming choice, albeit at an 8-point equity loss to AJEE.  LOAMIER is also a good choice.
>Brian_Whitt: EEIPSTT I2 PETITES +73 109
#note Q says Brian should play with fire by playing at C1 for only 2 more points - pfft.  This looks right to me.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEMNO 4D EMANA.E +20 85
#note After I hit the clock, I realized my error.  What's really shocking in retrospect was that I spent a lot of time a couple of turns back debating between MAZING or ZING, and MAZING scared me because of the easy front A hook.  So I worry about it there, and 2 turns later I whiff on a potential AMA(ZING)?  Obviously, AMAZING for 38 was the play. Surprisingly this is in the top tier of choices, though that's more of a reflection of how limited my options are than in the quality of this play.  From this point forward I have absolutely no chance in this game.
>Brian_Whitt: EHILMN 3H H.MLINE +33 142
>Jim_Burlant: ABDNORT 5D NOB +24 109
#note  This gets a marginal nod after a couple of hundred iterations, and it's the sim winner.  I'm 23% to win, and that's about to go downhill very quickly.  
>Brian_Whitt: ?DEEORW O1 REsOWED +95 237
>Jim_Burlant: ACDLRTT L1 TR.CLAD +22 131
#note Q gives marginal prefernce to 5H DIT or 5H TIDAL, but that assumes I can land some vowels.  Q docks me 5 points for this.  Whatever. Sim winner wins 2.2%; this wins 1.54.
>Brian_Whitt: AFORY 12A FORAY +48 285
#note Play scored incorrectly as 49.
>Jim_Burlant: EKNNPTV 3A VENT +17 148
#note There were better plays available, though they were admittedly hard finds.  Q says none of the choices make any appreciable difference in my winning chances.  This wins 0.09%; PINTLE and TINKLE at 5H win 0.13.
>Brian_Whitt: OSY 6D SOY +39 324
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHKNP N6 HANK +35 183
#note A few better plays available that I didn't know, most notably N6 PAKEHA, which wins 0.09% to this play's 0.05.
>Brian_Whitt: DOR A12 .ORD +24 348
>Jim_Burlant: AAEILPT A1 LA. +18 201
#note Weak.  Play incorrectly scored as 12.
