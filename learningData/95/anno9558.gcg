#note The choices are intriguing here.  I could either exchange the Q or take the points and run with ACQUIRE 4F.  I figured this would give me the best chance to score well on consecutive turns.

#note Even if I had seen CHAEBOL C5, I still probably would have played this.  It didn't seem likely that she would be able to bingo there.

#note And so Tom Adams' 18-0 record remains the best perfect record of all time.  This might have been the most fun way for the streak to end.
