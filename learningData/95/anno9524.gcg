>Darrell_Day: HNT 8F NTH +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: ?JMOSTW H7 W.OM +12 12
#note Q prefers 9H MOW and F8 NOWT to this.  No idea why I played so defensively - with the blank I should have opened up.
>Darrell_Day: IV 10F VI. +16 28
>Jim_Burlant: ?FJKNST -FJKN +0 12
#note Not sure I have this rack written correctly, but apparently I should only throw back FJT and keep KNS? if Q is to be believed.  Feh.
>Darrell_Day: BE F6 BE. +11 39
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGNRST I1 STRaNGE +65 77
#note Best bingo is apparently 7H WRONGEST, or 7H WRESTING.  I can't bingo w/o slotting the triple.
>Darrell_Day: DELNO 1D LODEN. +24 63
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEELQ -AEQ +0 77
#note Q(a)bALA would have played at 4H and scored 46; just enough to justify burning the blank.  Since I didn't see it, I didn't have much choice but to exchange.  
>Darrell_Day: OY H3 OY +19 82
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEILL F10 .IAL +7 84
#note No bingos play here.  Knowing Darrell and his defensive tendencies, I felt that the best plan was to open the southwest quadrant so I could maximize my chances to bingo with the blank.  Q prefers 2I TAILLE (no thanks), J2 AA, and E3 ILEA.  Maybe ILEA would have been better, but given the trouble I'd had drawing E's for a good part of this tournament, I wasn't giving mine up this cheaply.
>Darrell_Day: EITU 13F .UTEI +7 89
>Jim_Burlant: ?AELLOS D1 .OLL +8 92
#note Arrrgh!  LUTEA is good; LUTEI is bogus.  Post-mortem, without having run my racks through Zyzzyva, my gut told me I'd missed a bingo somewhere in this sequence, and this was it.  hALLOES plays at 12I, LOBELIAS plays at J8.  The star play is 14C LOESsAL 73.
>Darrell_Day: DEEH C2 HEED +27 116
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEMOS 12H AMOEBaS +81 173
#note AMBOnES scores 83.  Still winning 74% in a short sim.
>Darrell_Day: EY 13L YE +19 135
>Jim_Burlant: EFIORRT N5 ROTIFER. +65 238
#note Now winning 92%.  Despite my mistakes, I'm in the driver's seat.  Now I'm hoping to turn tiles and empty the bag as quickly as possible.
>Darrell_Day: ACNU 8K UNC.A +24 159
>Jim_Burlant: AIJPQSU K4 QUIP. +32 270
#note Not paying attention to the board.  QUAIS 14B scores 42, as does PUJAS in the same spot. Of those choices I like PUJAS best, as it doesn't open up anything bingo prone.  QUIPS 14B is insane.  Surprisingly, Q says this is only a 4-point dog to QUAIS or PUJAS.   Turning 4 tiles is good; 5 tiles and scoring 10 more points would have been better.
>Darrell_Day: IX L3 XI +40 199
>Jim_Burlant: ADGJSTW 2B D..W +27 297
#note Spent a couple of minutes on this turn.  I initally put down JAW E5 but didn't want to leave myself vowelless, and I also didn't want to open up bingo lines.  Didn't see B4 TAJ until after I hit the clock. During the post-game recount, Darrell told me he thought this was an excellent play.  While it unloads a W for 27, I felt there were two problems with this play.  First, it only turned 2 tiles (remember earlier point about trying to end the game ASAP).  Secondly, it doesn't defend anything.   TAJ wins the sim for good reason.  Not only does it outscore this by 5 points, but it kills the northwest end of the board.  And with AAAAA in the unseen pool, I shouldn't worry too much about burning the A.  Not finding TAJ was a bigger mistake than Quackle says it was.
>Darrell_Day: AUV M1 VAU +30 229
>Jim_Burlant: AAAGJST B4 TAJ +32 329
#note If I find TAJ on the previous turn, I don't have to worry about shutting down B column bingos and I can focus harder on defending O1, as he otherwise won't be able to bingo if he doesn't have an S.  But because I missed it on the last turn, I was busy atoning for that mistake and not looking hard enough for my best play.  1K JAVAS scores 48 and is clearly best - both for score and turnover.  This is runner up, at a 17-point loss in the sim.  For this game the deficit was more like 50 points.  This still wins 97%, but JAVAS wins 99, and you'll see why this was such a bad mistake in a second.
>Darrell_Day: ADEOZ O1 ADOZE +77 306
#note If I play JAVAS on the previous turn like I should have, what does Darrell do with this?  AZO B5, giving me a free run at the A column?  Q says Darrell still only has 12% winning chances, but this game was getting more and more uncomfortable.  And my last draw didn't help anything.
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEGNS 1A AA +9 338
#note Better at 11K for 16.
>Darrell_Day: FR 11E R.F +17 323
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGNST E5 GAN +14 352
#note Q likes G1 ENG best - looks right, as I shouldn't have played the case A.  I was less worried about building a bingo rack than just adding a couple of extra points to my score and making sure not to open up a line where he could put down a miracle bingo.  That's why I passed up CAGES 14B.
>Darrell_Day: EGIINRS N1 IN +18 341
>Jim_Burlant: CEGIRST 14C CRIS +18 370
#note I'd burned a lot of time earlier in the game when I had those blank racks where I either had no bingos or couldn't find the bingos, and as a result I was under 1-1/2 minutes. There were a zillion winning plays in this rack (practically any 5 at 14B wins) and I flat out missed all of them.  All I could come up with was this.  Pathetic!
