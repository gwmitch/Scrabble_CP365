>Mike: EGGIOTU N8 TEG +17 460
#note just an awful pull for the final rack.. unfortunately i stopped tracking and i was low on time, so i thought there was still an E left. i think i i wayyy overthought this, but anywhere here is what ti did  i saw she had XI 3C for 41 and VEX N8 for 56.  my idea.. play TEG N8 to bait her into playing RAX O7 for 46 instead of the 41 from XI 3C, then i can play FUGIO D4 to go out.  
>Wilma_Pitzer: AIRRSVX O7 RAX +46 470
#note woops, she had VARIX
>Mike: GIOU D4 .UGIO +10 470
#note even though in a way i screwed up the endgame because i stopped tracking.. still an epic comeback
