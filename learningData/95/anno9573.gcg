#note i'm usually good about not exchanging 7. AD may be a little better (or just D, quackle thinks...) (-2.5)

#note very lame, i didn't write down my rack here. i'm pretty sure i had three other consonants. this seems lke a critical move.
>k8: ?ABEHOS 8K OBEAH +41 61
#note there are three bingos here, two of which I should know. on the bright side, i did talk myself out of boatshed*

#note maybe i was too tired/frustrated and didn't write down my rack here either. i think it was all consonants or all vowels. i remember it being crappy.

#note i knew there was a bingo here, but i couldn't come up with it. yuck.
>cesar: AEEGRUY N2 YA +26 180
#note ugh i hate quackle sometimes. if i do AYE/YEA/EYE K11 i am blocking like 4 bingo lanes, right??? Is it ok to keep the superior leave? blah. (-7)

>cesar: EEGRU I7 ..ERGUE +17 197
#note i almost didn't challenge cuz i thought i lost anyway. when we came back i think i asked her if i could have the blank. (sorry, kate). i have no idea what my other two tiles were, but i didn't have the Q, although i was going for it. i probably had an A; i remember i was happy to find a decent-scoring dump.

#note ugh... well F10 NURSE is actually nice. i like it! (-4)
>k8: ?EEFIMV 13G FI. +30 299
#note b/t this and VIM I3. i chose to not shut down the bingo lanes at this point, and to take the couple extra points. 
>cesar: DLNOPSU 14A PLOD +29 291
#note this is frustrating. i should have been able to spot 11B PLOD. :(. 14J UPEND is the best play, though. (-10)
>k8: ?EEKMSV A11 VEE.S +33 332
#note missing kemps. fail. i purposely passed up KEPS though - ?VEM was a little too much to try to play through.
>cesar: AEIMNSU 6M .U. +6 297
#note fishing off the U in various different locations sims best multi-ply.
>k8: ?DHKMPW 11K K.PH +26 358
#note so... i'm probably not gonna bingo, he probably is, so i need a scoring spot. and to score. and to be able to outrun him. i figure sM and sW words are likely, but sH is probably more likely so dawk is better. or hawk, which scores two more.
>cesar: AEIMNST 1A AMNESTI. +89 386
#note KAPH was a great play. i guess i have to hope i can go out next turn. i strongly considered not bingoing. indeed, E11 MAG sims best! (-3%)
>k8: ?DMOORW O11 sWORD +49 407
#note i get crazy lucky to draw the vowels and he has no outplay.
