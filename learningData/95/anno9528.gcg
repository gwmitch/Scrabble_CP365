>Jim_Burlant: ?ACIUXY 8G YUCA +18 18
#note The 2-ply sim prefers 8G XU by not quite 1 point over 8F YUCA.  Eh - the Y isn't especially bingo prone, and XU might be too easy for him to overlap or underlap.  I figured I would unload the X next turn, and bingo on turn 3.  As for this placement - I have the blank, why not play aggressively?  Championship Player, on the other hand, agrees with me - CP likes this best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIITX M2 sEXTA.II +80 98
#note The only bingo, and I like this play a lot.  This is one of those words where, if I'm taking a Zyzzyva quiz and I know something's in there I'll find it.  But how easy would it have been to give up on the rack after 30 seconds and just play AXITE for 24?  Anyway - play incorrectly scored as 82.  
>Mike_Early: ?AAENRW 9A uNAWARE +67 77
#note A bit of a miss by Mike - H8 UNAWAREs scores 83 and wins 35%, though Quackle says that even that bingo is not Mike's best play. Q thinks L1 WANE 43, keeping AR?, is best.  I might be more inclined to agree with that if Mike could score 43 and keep AER? or ARS?.  I think UNAWAREs H8 was Mike's best play.  Then again, had Mike played WANE,this game may not have been the blowout it became.

#note The only bingo, and it wins 84%.
>Mike_Early: CIK D9 .ICK +26 103
>Jim_Burlant: AILLRSS 3H SALLI.RS +59 227
#note If Mike plays WANE a couple of turns back, what do I do with this?  This is the only bingo, and I'm now winning 94%.
>Mike_Early: DEGHU O1 GU.HED +45 148
>Jim_Burlant: AIIMNOS H1 MI.O +21 248
#note Thought I might have been missing something here, but there are no 7's, and the only possible 8's in this rack are SIMONIAC and INSOMNIA, and they don't play.  Championship player gives slight preference (not quite 2 points) to MINI 8L.  I just saw the easy 21 and solid AINS leave and that was enough for me.
>Mike_Early: ABEOV L9 ABOVE +22 170
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOSY 6E OY +28 276
#note Yeah, a little dangerous, but that AEINS leave was too enticing for me.    Q agrees; this is best.
>Mike_Early: FMPRU 5B FRUMP +42 212
#note Nice play by Mike.  He's winning 5%, but that's about to go down fast.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST 13B NASTIER +80 356
#note Best bingo.
>Mike_Early: EEQU C1 QUEE. +28 240
>Jim_Burlant: ADINOTZ 11D .OZ +28 384
#note Ah well, I had to miss some time.  10G DITZ scores 43.   The duck says everything wins 99.9x%, but this gives up a little too much on the scoreboard.  DITZ is best.
>Mike_Early: FOW H12 F.OW +42 282
>Jim_Burlant: ADINOST N5 OD +19 403
#note Best.  I admit it - I was getting greedy, looking for another bingo.
