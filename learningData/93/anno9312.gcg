>John_Luebkemann: BEFGINP 8G FIB +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINNOR 9H NE +10 10
#note If this, then EN!  Ugh.  ONE is better anyway.
>John_Luebkemann: ?AEEGNP 10F PANGEnE +76 92
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNOR 8G ...RIONNE +45 55
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNOR --  -45 10
#note Q says EONIAN.  I say make up a word and hope it flies.  (It doesn't.)
>John_Luebkemann: ADEGITU K5 DAUTI.G +32 124
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNOR 8K .RONA +18 28
#note Q wants (E)ONIAN again.  Feh.  TINEA/TENIA is another option, but nah.  I'm fine with mine.
>John_Luebkemann: AEEEIUY 9M YEA +23 147

>John_Luebkemann: CEEENTU L4 CEE +15 162
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIRRTT -RT +0 54
#note I didn't like any of the plays on column D, but I guess they're better than no points.
>John_Luebkemann: EINNTTU 7D TUNE +11 173
#note 12F UT 10?  Meh.  12G TUN 7?  Double meh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIORT D3 TERA.OID +70 124
>John_Luebkemann: FHIMNTT 5B TH.IFT +24 197
#note This or HM.  I think THRIFT is better, too, though Q disagrees.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIIKOW F2 WAI. +18 142
#note Times like this I wish KAWAII*! was good.  ...  ...  I really missed a 41-point WOK to balance my rack?  Sheesh!  I figured I was down enough I needed to bingo.  I'm happy to see, though, that it sims much better than static has it.
>John_Luebkemann: HMNOSUW C8 WHOM +33 230
#note Q static says J4 MOWN 37.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIKOQ 6A QI +17 159
#note Of note: 3B OA(T)C(A)KE 36.  I think I played this here instead of at C2 to hope for some volatility to get back into it.
>John_Luebkemann: INOSTUX G2 OX +39 269
#note And he just upped the stakes even more, saying "let's have some fun."  (Me, I'm tempted to take a 42-point Q play and run with the X later.)  12D TOXIN 50 is also nice!
>Ryan_Fischer: AACEKOR 1G CROAK +45 204
#note The simple OKE H1 41 is what Q static likes.  There are so many options here.  A short sim reveals... yeah, CROAK gives me the best fighting chance.
>John_Luebkemann: IILNSTU A6 .UILT +42 311
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDEELO 2J BALED +44 248
>John_Luebkemann: GINRSVZ N6 ZI.. +33 344
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ELMORY B11 MOLY +24 272
#note I spent a LONG time here trying to suss out a bingo that fit on row 12, to no avail.  Was very close with POLYMER.  I thought it was important to keep the O either/or make new lanes.  Champ says go ahead and take the points with YOM.  YLEM 3L is oh so nifty too!
>John_Luebkemann: DGNRSSV M1 D.V +14 358
#note Well, wow, I sure got lucky there.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ELOPRS 14A P.RrOLES +64 336
#note Wow, so I find the ONLY bingo here, and it's not only not the best play, it's not even a top play!  John was right, as he surmised after the game, that my best chance would be to forego the bingo and play L(O)PE here.  I did not realize JUST how bad the pool was and how the only way he could stop me then is if he played something like 13A A(L)S.
>John_Luebkemann: GNRSSSV G13 V.G +11 369
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEORU 13F A.O +10 346
#note Champ says O3 UREA 16.  That path loses by 13, so I'm sunk.  I make this play to get more bang for my next one.  (Here, very low on time.)
>John_Luebkemann: NRSSS M7 S..S +21 390
>Ryan_Fischer: EERU -  +0 346
#note My path loses by 26 anyway, and I figure maybe just maybe this is an adjective so I challenge.
