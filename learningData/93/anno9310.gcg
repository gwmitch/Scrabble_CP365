#note What's the worst that could happen?  And I wonder, which is safer to put here?  M or R?  Either way, had to do it.

#note I spent at least a good 5 minutes debating between OX for 50 and MIX for 36.  I don't know if it's as straightforward as "dude, it's 14 more points!"  The leave is pretty horrendous, and if I don't hit perfectly, I'm not going anywhere fast.  Zyzzyva says the ONLY 7s I can draw after OX are SUICIDE, UNIFIED, and URIDINE, the latter two DON'T EVEN GO DOWN.  I think that's probably as clear a case as any with 3 Ses out (and 4 Ts)!  Still, I went with the points.

#note What's that you say, Champ?  You mean I actually got a pre-endgame right?!  I tracked right?!  I was about to play THUD but then I saw TARGETS in the pool (and TATTERS) and figured out the only way to block?!  And so now I'll win instead of lose in such dramatic fashion?!  WHEEEE!  :D
