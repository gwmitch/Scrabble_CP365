#note jeez. i was warned about his closed board play and strongly considered M11 DITZ but in the end decided against it. both plays sim very closely.

#note ugh, really? i lose 15 equity points for not playing D1 RE for freaking two points????? there's no way that is close to right.  (-15.5)

#note OH GOD. i missed. time to try again. quackle likes N12 GEE because it is RIDICULOUS but maybe i need to play it now that i've embarked on this path. (-8)

#note 14L IGG, going with the same theme. yes, i knew my play was the worst-simming play of all time, but my little experiment is over. time to hold on and pray he doesn't bingo. (-16)
>dave_l: AD B13 .AD +12 269
>cesar: AAEGLSW 14I GALAS +13 308
#note lol, i know i'm playing ridiculously. ADAGES scores, yes, but i don't think this is that terrible. looking at the details, dave has about a 13% chance of bingoing after ADAGE/ADAGES, and a 4% chance after GALAS. so i was on the right track, and i will gladly sacrifice all the equity in the world to win the game. plus, i'm likely to draw the X especially after his last few plays. (-19.5)

#note i lost a lot of equity even though i was highly focused. that's expected though in a very closed board. oh well.
