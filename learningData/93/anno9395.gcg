>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAALNOO -IIIII +0 0
#note cesar: this was kind of unfair. ryan only had like 12 minutes on his clock at the beginning of the game. so i had an incentive to play fast. keeping ALN is a little better; i don't like the L-N synergy that much. (-0.5) (and i know a few people who would exchange 7 here... NO)
>Ryan_Fischer: BEIILOT 8D BOITE +20 20
#note ryan: 8D BOLETI 22?
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAINOOU D5 OUA.AIN +9 9
#note ha .. it does sim at the top :)
>Ryan_Fischer: CILLOTU E1 CULTI +18 38
#note ryan: E10 TOLUIC 22, C10 LOCULI 20, C10 TOLUIC 20 ... 11B LI(N)OCUT 18.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EGIIKOS 12A KOIS +46 55
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADDLOU H4 DUOD.nAL +61 99
#note ryan: Best.  Almost tempting to take A12 (K)UDO 27.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EGIINQZ G3 QI +24 79
#note i did see QUIZ, liked keeping EGINZ a lot better! a bit surprised, but maybe it's partly the defense. (-1.5)
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEENOT 1D O.EAN +24 123
#note ryan: I think this is close to what I had.  If so, ACETONE is a bit better.  Didn't write down my leave.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EGINOSZ B10 ZO.NS +68 147
#note ryan: Ow. cesar: saw agonizes, and agonized a bit over the choice. i liked playing more defensively especially because he's low on time. (-3)
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEMOY 2B ODE.M +40 163
#note ryan: Best.  (Phew.)
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AEGIILR A12 .AIL +28 175
#note i actually almost chickened out on this. i have KAIL on the back of my scoresheet, repeatedly underlined
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEHPY 3A EYE +23 186
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEFGINR 11G F.EERING +74 249
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGHPW 10J WAP +35 221
#note ryan: I really hated closing this down.  Didn't see much better.  AWE(I)GH, perhaps.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?ADNOTT 6G D.TATiON +62 311
#note ryan: Only -- NICE!  cesar: well, i almost chickened out on this one too :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGHRSU 1A UH +24 245
#note ryan: O4 GUSHER 45 if you're a silly computer that doesn't understand that you're down 100.  This, otherwise.  :)
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EFIPTVX M3 PIV.T +22 333
#note oh that's just terrible. maybe it's because the I was a blank, but i couldn't think of any horizontal plays. FIXT is clearly much better than my play! (-13)
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGRRS O2 GREASER +86 331
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ABEFRXY 4A FAY +39 372
#note ryan: Dammit, misscored as 43 (not that it matters too much). cesar: oops. FAX is probably better, but i wanted to keep the X for 12L. EX 12K just seems too dangerous and pointless, but it does sim best. i guess it scores. (-3)
>Ryan_Fischer: CGLNRVW 7B CR.WL +18 349
#note ryan: Best, hope fading.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BEEMRTX K3 TEX. +22 394
#note after a long analysis (with 2 in the bag, championship player theoretically plays out every possible endgame), 4L XI sims best. makes perfect sense. TEXT is possibly giving up JIN, plus i get perfect information after his game. still it seems difficult for me to lose this game after TEXT, which is why i played it. (-6%)
>Ryan_Fischer: EGHIJNV 9C J.G +26 375
#note ryan: J2 JIN 30 is counterintuitively better.  Blocks his plays (which are quite hard to see).
>Cesar_Del_Solar: BEMRRS 4J B.M.R. +20 414
#note ryan: Brilliant, really.  Also, BERIME. cesar: thanks.. but actually, i think i didn't think of these plays when i played TEXT even though i had BMR left :)
>Ryan_Fischer: EHINV -  +0 375
#note It's a GIVEN that I thought it was only one and not the other.  Oops.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ERS A7 SER +20 434
#note ryan: Well, he played that quite well! cesar: it sure would be fairer if we both started with 25 minutes. as a matter of fact, i think i ended up using almost all my time on this game!
