>joe_e: AHIMRT N2 THIRAM +34 123
#note and then i held for like 5 minutes on this! i knew THIARM was one of the two, but could not remember that the other one was so close to it. i thought it was a cool word like MARTISH or MITHRAS. actually, my hand almost hit the challenge button after i thought of MITHRAS until i remembered it was some mythical japanese creature. (i think) oh wait, is that Mothra? in any case, i eventually convinced myself it was good...
