>Jeff: CEIMORV 8D VOMER +28 28
#note VOICER or VOICE are better, no E under the DLS.
>Ben: AEGISUU D8 .AGUE +18 18
#note AUGU(R)IES, wow. Your play takes the next best, though.
>Jeff: ACEIORT 13C ORCA +22 50
#note I actually did consider playing off the O, but went for points. EROTICA obviously is the best play.
>Ben: FIOSTUU 10B FU. +15 33
#note 7G FOU or add the other U for FU(G)U are top.
>Jeff: DEEEILT 7E LED +17 67
#note My fish leaves too many vowels.... 11B ET(U)DE is best.
>Ben: AIOSTUZ F13 .ZO +32 65
>Jeff: BEEEIPT 9G BEEP +23 90
#note Keep the P for better balance?
>Ben: AINRSTU 15B RAIN.UTS +77 142
>Jeff: AEIOSTX 14I OX +27 117
#note 14I AXITES is 60. This fish worked out, though.
>Ben: ACEFOTV 13I COVET +43 185
>Jeff: AEGIRST K3 AIGRETS +75 192
>Ben: AFHOOPY L2 OAF +24 209
#note Q likes the riskier 14L HOOF...
>Jeff: EENNNRT 3J N..N +8 200
#note Q likes this one.
>Ben: AHIOPQY 2I QI +17 226
#note Q likes (T)OPHI, but otherwise your Q dump is best.
>Jeff: DEENRTU E10 UT +16 216
#note I should have taken (T)UNED for the easy points. I kept the N instead of the T because of the G on the board.


>Ben: AEHIOPY L12 Y.AH +28 254
#note Huh, 12L YEAH is 40 points instead of 28.
>Jeff: DEEMNRR 15L .ERM +27 243
>Ben: EIIINOP -IIIPON +0 254
#note Sims best, though initially keeping EN is the top recommended exchange.
>Jeff: DEEJNNR 8K .REND +21 264
>Ben: DEEGITW 14A WED +22 276
>Jeff: AEIJNNY N6 JE.NY +39 303
>Ben: DEGIKOT E5 KI.. +16 292
#note 10G TIDE is a cool parallel play.
>Jeff: AAIINPT 5G PIIN. +8 311
#note Should have looked for scoring plays- it's close and there aren't really any bingo lanes so I think the best think to do is rack up points. F2 PINA is best.
>Ben: DEGLOST 6D D.G +19 311
#note GLOST and GLEDS score in the top corner. (I only knew the latter.)
>Jeff: ?AAILTW 1L LATI +23 334
>Ben: EILOSST O5 TOL. +16 327
#note Q likes 4G OS, leaving EILST. That's clever, since it opens a bingo lane and you have a good chance of bingoing. But it's risky if I have a bingo ready. Your play sims next in line.
>Jeff: ??ABHIW 14L .HA +22 356
>Ben: AEILOSS 10B ....ES +19 346
>Jeff: ??BIW M7 B.e +16 372
#note Ha, I could have gone out with BoW(F)In.
