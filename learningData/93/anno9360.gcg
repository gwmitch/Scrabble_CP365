>Geoff: BCOOTTW I5 BOTT +12 12
#note What...um, okay, not back from lunch yet, I see. G6 TWO or G8 BOW would have been fine.

#note COW or OW here? 
>Nigel_R.: AILORTV L4 VIOLAT.R +74 150
>Geoff: ?DEFINO E7 cOF.INED +78 123
#note G6 INFORmED scores one more and is a nice fit.

>Geoff: AENRSSU O4 SAUN.ERS +59 224
#note DANSEURS scores four more; SAUNTERS seemed a little safer, so I went with it. Sim likes DANSEURS by a couple.
>Nigel_R.: ESW 12L SEW +36 229
>Geoff: DIKMNOY 14B KID.Y +44 268
#note MIDDY does as well despite scoring 4 less. Not giving up the front hook, it appears.

>Geoff: EIINNNT 15A NINE +27 390
#note Not sure I have this rack exactly right, but it was something like this. J and Z still out, hmm...
>Nigel_R.: EIILSUV 3E .I +4 375
#note This was Nigel's actual rack. Whoa...
>Geoff: BCIJNOT D8 JO +39 429
#note Wow, I totally thought I'd thrown this game away. I'm still not sure I didn't. Quackle strongly doesn't think so: it has JO at 94.5% to win, while the next best plays are in the low 80s. Then again, it's not inferring that Nigel at least didn't have the Z when he played PI, and that changes things a lot. I saw LIGURES and SURVEIL as possibilities, but I was also concerned that I could find myself stuck with big consonants and lose in the endgame. As the bag and Nigel's rack actually were, he had a 1-in-3 shot, and he hit it.
