>Geoff: AABGOTX 8G TAXA +22 22
#note GOX is about 3-4 better. BOX and GAB also ahead of TAXA. Didn't have a good feel for this rack - spent two minutes muddling with it.
>Pat: FOP 7H FOP +28 28
>Geoff: ABGJLNO 9F JOB +24 46
#note Hard to read my writing - I think this is the rack. BONG is 8 more points. Don't see myself having a good J play next turn, though...dead heat in a short sim.
>Pat: DUW 9J WUD +15 43
#note Misscored as 13.

>Pat: ?EGIILU 14B LInGUI.E +70 231
>Geoff: CEMMRTU M10 MUTE +24 265
#note Eh, many better plays. Should have looked longer. Also, maybe CMR isn't as good as I was rating it.
>Pat: EPRV 6K P.RVE +22 253
#note Misscored as 23.
>Geoff: CDEMRRY 13G M.RCY +26 291
>Pat: OTU L2 OUT..... +38 291
>Geoff: DEFIORR 15A RIFE +33 324
#note 5F FIREDOG 32 is pretty - didn't see it. (Not sure I made a single pretty play the whole tournament, come to think of it.) RIFE is a point or two behind. 
>Pat: AQY 3K Q.AY +32 323
>Geoff: ADEORRT 13C DO +22 346
#note This scores best, but doesn't further other important goals like blocking the QUAYS hook, going after the blank, or creating possible lines for my bingoish remaining tiles. 4L TROD 14 wins a short sim. DO is 4 back.
>Pat: EILOO 4H OOLI.E +20 343
>Geoff: AEIIRRT 5G AIR +7 353
#note Both esses and the blank left, and I have AIR in my TIRE. Not looking good, and yet Quack still says I'm favored to win by a little. AIR wins 55%; 10B RAI wins 62%. Pat might fish a tile, or she might score at O1 and make me bingo out. 
>Pat: ACKS O1 CASK +62 405
#note Well, it's bingo or die now...
>Geoff: ?BEEIRT N2 B. +22 375
#note Went 2:45 over on time trying to find the bingo that wasn't.
>Pat: DHINS 6C HINDS +15 420
#note Misscored as 13. Actual final score 427-345, after my time penalty.
>Pat:  (EEIRT?) +10 430
