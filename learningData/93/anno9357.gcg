>Geoff: EEEFHIY 8F EYE +12 12
#note Should have played FEY, yeah. Maybe I got dissuaded by the vowel-heavy leave and the easy overlaps FEY gives. 8G FIE was maybe closer to what I was going for, and it was a few points better than EYE and 1.5 behind 8G FEY in sim.

#note Yeah, thought I missed a better one here: BIOGENIC N1. 
>Joel: CEILMRR 2H CLIM.ER +30 128
>Geoff: EGOOPRT O5 .ROOP +24 137
#note 15:00 on clock after this play. REDTOP in the same spot does a couple of points better; don't think I saw it. 
>Joel: AINORUV 9C VAIR +17 145
>Geoff: EEGITWZ D8 T.WIE +18 155
#note Quackle prefers M1 TEW 24. Yeah, I was a little fixated on the D column there.
>Joel: IINOOUU -IINOOUU +0 145
>Geoff: DEGGMTZ 11C Z.GGED +36 191
#note After endless debate...no, not really.
>Joel: IKNORTW M8 TINWORK +81 226
>Geoff: AMOQRST 15J QATS +29 220
#note Ouch. Didn't see the TRANQ spot. At least I rightly decided AMORTS* was no good.
>Joel: AEENPST C11 .AP +30 256
#note Oh god...if I'd played TRANQ like I was supposed to, he'd have bingoed for a jillion on the 15 row. Scrabble is ridiculous sometimes.
>Geoff: EELMORT 3K M.TEL +26 246
#note Q likes playing MOLE instead, keeping RT. I agree. 
>Joel: AEENSTV H11 .AVEN +30 286
>Geoff: CEJOORU L12 JO +38 284
#note Even after JO, I'm less than 30% to win. K8 JUCO 35 would have been as good.
>Joel: AEIOSST N12 TEA +31 317
>Geoff: CEEORUU H1 E.RU +21 305
#note Couldn't decide between ECU, ECRU or trading. Didn't think I could afford to trade...put down ECU first, then changed my mind at the last second for the six extra points, figuring my chances were good to get a consonant draw. ECRU is very slightly ahead on equity, ECU the same on win pct. I think ECU was probably right. 
>Joel: IINOSSS 14C SINS +21 338
>Geoff: CELNOUX 1N OX +30 335
#note Wavered between O14 EX and this. Didn't see ILEX, which is a shade better than EX. Part of it was thinking I'd need a bingo to win and not wanting to lose the E, though I think ILEX would have been worth it had I seen it. A lot of little blindnesses this game.
>Joel: ADFIOSU 10J FOU.DS +31 369
>Geoff: CELLNNU K5 .LENC.N +22 357
>Geoff: CELLNNU --  -22 335
#note And...one very funny large blindness at the end, though it didn't affect the outcome. Yep, misread the blank as an A. Joel insta-challenged, at least graciously adding that it would have been a nice play.
