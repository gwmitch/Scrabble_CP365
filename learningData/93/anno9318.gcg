#note Note to self: AI takes a ton of hooks in badpods. This sims terribly because of defense. GON# and AGON in line J keep solid leaves and give nothing back; this lags about 6 points behind.

#note Sim prefers PAUA# 6E for fewer points, attempting to run up the score with the blank in hand. At this score, I like playing defense better. Let him open the board for me.

#note Now Quackle wants to start getting defensive? VIRTU 10F? I'm confused. I think the right strategy is to score decently without giving him huge comebacks. I missed VITA 7C, which I like a lot.

#note The sim recommends not bingoing -- SUITE O11 for 32 over the bingo for 61. Disagree, since this board is kinda ugly and the bingo might not be available much longer. Plus I want more turnover to dig for O's for the ADO hook.

#note MOKO# and TOKO# are both good. They're the only two wins here. Nice play by John to eke this one out. I held, recounted the game on my time, and challenged since I had to.
