#note Rafi recommended U(R)ANIA after learning my rack.  Q says AU(D)IO which I think is even better.  He explains a concept I already knew but didn't listen to, that opening spots like 2J are much worse than spots like L12 -- by I'm guessing about 20 points on average.  Think, a 50-60 point play at one spot versus 30-40 at the other.  Also also, UNAI is still off from being balanced in the same way that OE is.

#note And then there's THAT.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEENO 3M AE +14 44
#note K7 A(R)EAE 10.

#note Nothing to see here.  Move it along, people!

#note Only.  Y'know, Winter opened with 5 bingos versus me over Memorial Day weekend last year in Atlanta.  At this points I was rooting for Rafi, especially with both blanks unseen.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEKTV 15E CA.KET +36 136
#note Best.
>Rafi_Stern: OX 10E OX.. +28 321
#note Only 28?  C'mon.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DELTVY 11B LEVY +30 166
#note No DATIVELY (which admittely, I wasn't sure of).  VEx(E)DLY for 52 sure is tempting at this score, not that it would help.

#note Hated blocking this.  Ugh.

#note Juuuuust GREAT.  Q says it's best.  Still, yuck.
>Rafi_Stern: AFIR B10 F.AIR +32 396
#note Charitable of him.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGIRTZ 12A Z. +21 237
#note 10E (OXID)IZER 45.  This dump is realy dumb considering what scoring plays there are.  ZE(S)T sims a bit higher than that cool extension.  RITZ(Y) is also an option.
>Rafi_Stern: QSU 4J SUQ +29 425
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGIRT A4 TERGItE +79 316
#note Yeah, a reason my fish wasn't great.  This and (L)EGERITy are all that's available!
>Rafi_Stern: AHJ 9C HAJ +30 455
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIORWW K10 WOW. +20 336
#note I started to play 12I WIDOWER 90 forming WO, IT, and DS* (:*() but thought the better of it.  WEIRDO does play down on row 14 for 37!
