#note TWEE has an ugly leave.  CUVETTE is pretty nice save for the W leave.  WET scores too little.  All in all, I'm pretty happy with this.  (L)ETTUCE, of note.  I saw CUVEE, but couldn't quite get to CUVETTE obviously.

#note So glad I saw this.  Glad I wasn't making it up, too!

#note I saw AJOWAN first but passed it up when he opened that spot and I saw ADOWN.  Q static likes WA(N).  Nice 'cause it kills that ugly easy Z spot.  IJL is kinda weak, which is why it'd be smart to pass up ADOWN.  Sim is inconclusive.  I guess the best thing to do is get rid of the J and bingo again ASAP which is what AJOWAN does.

#note JAIL, QUAIL, DIQUAT.  Decisions.  Mine sets up at least JUT, which is fine I guess.

#note That spot.  That SPOT ... it comes to bite me in the ass.  And this is the nicest guy, my opponent, and his hands shake a little when he's drawing, and so I see him expose that he's JUST got the other blank.  He's fished, and gotten it.  So with four lanes to speak of, I'm pretty in trouble.  I'm sitting on a nongo and an X-bomb, and like in the Shreve game, I have to DEBATE whether to take the bomb or not lest it screw me over.  I am greatly amused by that.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEINOX 14I OX +59 367
#note So if you tell Champ to assume the opponent has the blank, NIXED and OX both win 34%.  So basically, which way doth though wanteth to be screwed?  NIXED has a better valuation, oddly.  By 7(!) points.  I just figured somehow I might be able to bingo back as well with a decent leave.
>William_Clark: ?DEIMOS 14A wISEDOM +84 412
>William_Clark: ?DEIMOS --  -84 328
#note (!)  (Best is 15F DIStOME 99.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEINP 15F CAPE +34 401
#note Interesting!  Champ has 15E DANCE 34 winning 91%, which means even with him bingoing down from the E or S, I can still pull it out.  This is with me telling Champ his rack, of course.  I reason I can't play PANIC (rightly -- MISCODED, Q!  MISCODED!)  I DON'T KNOW why Champ says PANIC is 84% to win when MISCODED will KILL me.  I like CAPE 'cause it obstructs and scores.  You can never trust a Champ Win%.  PICE is the sim winner at around 61%.  CAPE and PACE are the same principle at 49%.
>William_Clark: ?DEIMOS O1 .EISMOiD +83 411
#note Here, I did myself a little math with plenty of time and full knowledge of what's left and deduced that by letting this stay and playing it out I could win.  So I did!  :)  The real bingos are SODOMIES, SESAMOID, EMBODIES, and EMEROIDS.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIINR D11 RANID +32 433
#note And I found the best play too!  :)  This, RADII, and NADIR all win!  :D
>William_Clark: ER L7 .......ER +15 426
#note ...though I didn't take into account that, which cost me 3 points, which could've really hurt in some other universe.  Still, that's a pretty satisfying (lucky as hell) outcome for having stared down the barrel of the blank.  We agreed on a score of 435-427.  Still on the agenda: learning how to add and score properly.
