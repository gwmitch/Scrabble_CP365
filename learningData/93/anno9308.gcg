>Rahn: ACFRSSY 8D FARCY +34 34
#note Actual rack.  Some interesting choices available, but Quackle likes this best.
>Matt: DEIOPRS E7 P.RODIES +72 72
#note Didn't want to provide an S hook with DIASPORE since it was the same amount of points.
>Rahn: EEORSSV 13C OV.RSEES +76 110
#note Only bingo.
>Matt: AEENNOO D12 O.EN +22 94
#note I liked unloading the dupes for points...Quackle agrees.  Scored as 20.
>Rahn: ELLY H12 Y.LL +33 143
>Matt: AEINORT J6 NOTARIE. +62 156
#note He blocked my 9 of REA(C)TION(S)...still don't have one of those in tourney play.  It would have played in Collins.
>Rahn: AEU K4 EAU +8 151
>Matt: GHIKLMT L2 KITH +31 187
#note I can afford to lose the game, just not by more than 165.  So I'm not opening up any 3x3's unless necessary.  This does best of the non-L1 plays.  Scored as 29.
>Rahn: AF M3 FA +23 174
>Matt: ?CEGLMO J2 COG +17 204
#note Huh, Quackle actually does like MIG.  With one blank in tow, I don't mind playing defensively here.
>Rahn: DENOOST N4 SNOOTED +70 244
>Matt: ?ELMOXZ F8 .EX +53 257
#note Debated between taking out column O and cashing the X.  I decided the points were worth it, especially since I can score with the Z next turn.  Quackle agrees.
>Rahn: DEINW M9 WIDEN +38 282
#note Not sure why he didn't play this down Column O...he said he was concerned with obstructing it, but taking it for 6-8 more points seems better.  
>Matt: ?BLMOUZ 12L Z.BU +32 289
#note I actually overdrew here, he flipped over BPU and threw back the P.  I get rid of the junk on my rack for 32.  Luckbox.
>Rahn: IQU 15A QUI. +39 321
#note I don't remember what he said his rack was, but he said he couldn't use the Q down column O.  
>Matt: ?LLMNOR O7 MON +31 320
#note Missed NORMaLLY...that's pretty bad, as it's a common word.  Just didn't look hard with this rack.  This is best of the rest.
>Rahn: AV 3H AV. +10 331
>Matt: ?EGLLRT H1 GL.RE +21 341
#note Time to take away the easy 7 lane he created...if he bingoes to any of those letters, more power to him.
>Rahn: AAEGMNT L10 GA.E +24 355
#note Actual rack, he said I blocked his MAGENTA etc.  He wondered if ZAG was better, but he should be keeping bingo lanes open and hoping to pull blanks.  FAG is best since it keeps the E and doesn't muck anything up. 
>Matt: ??AILTT 15H .ITTorAL +68 409
#note There plenty of InG bingoes up top, but I thought it was worth giving up 6 points to not give him more bingo lanes.  
>Rahn: ABM I9 BAM +23 378
>Matt: AEIIIJP 5E JAP. +26 435
#note I actually had him tracked with INTRUDE somehow, so I blocked INTRUDER and kept the E to score next turn with one of my three I's.  Given what he actually has, I'm a winner no matter what valid word I play.  
>Rahn: DHNRTUW F2 THR.W +21 399
#note The duck suggests NAW F4, in order to slow play my awful rack.  I think he just wanted to be done with the game ASAP.
>Matt: EIII G7 I.E +11 446
>Rahn: DNU 2C DUN. +5 404
#note Final score recorded as 442-408.
>Rahn:  (II) +4 408
