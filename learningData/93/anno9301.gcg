#note After discussion, Geoff said there was nothing he could do to stop me from bingoing, so he had to pick the bingo I was most likely to miss, between BECRUSTS and GRUTCHES. Really, had be picked BECRUSTS, I also had BUTCHERS which I certainly would have seen and bingoed out. Geoff elected to play GID because I was less likely to see it, but in reality AID instead of GID blocks all bingoes and wins. 
>Matt_Canik: ?CERSTU 14B CURES +27 303
#note I look for a while, I actually see grutches, but doubt it's good because I've never seen it before, and I figure Geoff wouldn't set me up for that if it were.
