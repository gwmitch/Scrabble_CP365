>Jeff: CDEGTWY 8D WEDGY +34 34
>Ben: AEINSTX 7H ANTISEX +71 71
#note Well so far we're playing the top sim choices. There were no 8's.
>Jeff: CEFGJRT E8 .JECT +28 62
#note Forgot that I could add an R on front and get rid of an extra consonant. Funny, though, Q actually likes keeping the R better anyway, probably because it goes with the F.
>Ben: DENOOTZ 10B ZON.D +39 110
#note 6D OOZED or 6E OZONE score 42 and get rid of both O's.
>Jeff: ?FGLRRV K5 FR.G +16 78
#note Best bingo fishing play.
>Ben: EEGIOST 6H GOE. +20 130
#note EGOTISE# and GOETIES# are Collins only. Maybe now we'll remember.
>Jeff: ?LNRTUV M6 V.RTU +9 87
#note Darn. Missed ViRUL(E)NT. 8M LUV is way better, too.
>Ben: EILORST 11G LOITERS +73 203
>Jeff: ??AILNP 13C PLAINts +81 168
>Ben: AFILOOO 12A FLOA. +32 235
#note What a rack! L1 FOLIA is the only thing that sims better.
>Jeff: ABDERSW L1 DAWSE +27 195
#note 7C WAD is best, as I thought.
>Ben: CDIIOOU A12 .OCI +27 262
#note FUCI in the same place? Quackle hates U's. With the Q unplayed I'd probably hang on to it too.
>Jeff: BEELMRR 2J BL.MER +32 227
#note At least I found the best play here.
>Ben: DIOSUUY 3L .UD +25 287
#note Quackle must have known you'd draw another U. 10H YOU gets rid of the U and Y.
>Jeff: AEEIOOR 6M .OE +19 246
#note Now I'm in trouble.
>Ben: AIOQSUY 8M .YA +31 318
#note 8K (G)O(R)Y or 1H QUA are top.
>Jeff: AEIINOR 1G INIA +16 262
#note Probably should have continued the bingo fish with 10I OI.
>Ben: AINOQSU 2A QUINOAS +88 406
