>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGIOR 8H AGIO +10 10
#note The 8F placement is 3rd.  I think that's pretty dumb.  GEOID is first, followed by DOGIE.  This rack is pretty deceptive, so I'm happy that I played AGIO.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?ELOQRT J7 Q. +11 11
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEENR I8 .ADARENE +62 72
#note Missed ANEARED.  Wow.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?ELLORT 12B sTROLLE. +66 77
#note fELLATOR and cOLLARET are the 2x2s.  She saw SOLLERET but questioned it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEIVX 15H V.XED +54 126
#note Or B9 AXI(s)ED 58.
>Liz_Gottlin: AERSTUY E11 Y.U +12 89
#note L7 ESTUARY 79, D6 TREASU(R)Y 62.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIOPW K10 COWPI. +26 152
#note 14I (N)OW 24?
>Liz_Gottlin: AAEINRT B8 ANTI.ERA +68 157
#note 10F ERA(D)I(C)ANT 68.  Duh.  REATTAIN is a teeny bit better human play.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEEIO -AEEEIO +0 152
>Liz_Gottlin: AEFHINO A4 FOEHN +51 208
#note Or FOH down low.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEHTV 5A .VErHEAT +76 228
#note Or OVERHATE
>Liz_Gottlin: ACIIKOR 15A C.RK +45 253
#note H1 KRAI(T) 30, 12K (W)RICK 38.  CARK is understandably down low 'cause of its poor leave, but it may be worth it, taking the most potent spot.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABJMSTY L4 JAMBS +41 269
#note C2 MAJ(E)STY 46.  I think this is better.
>Liz_Gottlin: AIIIIOS -IIIII +0 253
#note I wasn't too far off, first filling with five Is!  Best exchange.
>Ryan_Fischer: FORTTWY M3 TOWY +41 310
#note And just like that, the game has shifted in my favor.
>Liz_Gottlin: AGMSSUU I1 MAGUS +24 277
#note GAMU(T) or GAMU(T)S.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIINRT 1D INFIR. +36 346
#note D2 FE(r)RITIN 72.  Whoops.  6E IF 31?
>Liz_Gottlin: EEGSTUU D3 GU.U +8 285
#note Really unfortunate here, but in order to give yourself any chance of winning you must leave these lines alone.  Gotta exchange here of this is your best play.  (F)UGU(E) is a bit better, leaving the R alone.  Still quite unfortunate.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIIOST F9 IDO. +14 360
#note L12 OI 18; mine kills pretty much the last lane.
>Liz_Gottlin: DEEOOST N2 DOE +20 305
#note Plays at L11 for 25.  Needs volatility though.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIRST O1 RETS +33 393
#note Yet again I find a top-simming move Champ overlooks.
>Liz_Gottlin: EEINOST L12 OE +18 323
>Ryan_Fischer: ABIILPZ 7F BIZ +26 419
#note M10 LIPA 30 leaves BIZ to go out.
>Liz_Gottlin: EILNNST M9 INLETS +30 353
>Ryan_Fischer: AILP 13A P.A +14 433
#note Shoulda played PAW or ZAP.
>Liz_Gottlin: N 5K N.. +12 365
