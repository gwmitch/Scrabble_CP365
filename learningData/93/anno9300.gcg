>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: EINORTV H8 .OVERINT +86 86
#note I told Sammy the best I could see was through the R.  Then he taught me this # anagram of INVENTOR.
>Marlon_Hill_&_Bob_Linn: ALOPTV 13G P.VOTAL +38 62
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: ?EEEFGM 14J FEE +31 117
#note I was aiming for FEM originally, but Sammy wanted to do this for better defense.  I think he's right, because not only do we keep the O15 spot away from them, but we also make it likely that their best play is 12L-O, which could give us big comebacks to a triple.
>Marlon_Hill_&_Bob_Linn: EW 12L WE +24 86
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: ?AEEGMR D1 MEAGERl. +82 199
#note I saw MEAGREST# and had no idea if it was good, so I asked Sammy.  He couldn't remember and said why don't we just play MEAGERLY.  If I had spotted AGREMENT#, I would have known it.  Sammy also pointed out the nice double-double METERAGE they had just blocked.
>Marlon_Hill_&_Bob_Linn: IQU 1A QUI. +45 131
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: ?AGIJSW 11B JIGSAW.d +86 285
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: DEHLO (challenge) +5 290
#note Though I of course saw JIGSAWN, I don't think I noticed it slotted the J for 4 more points.  There's a good case to be made for this play anyway, but it was definitely worth it when they challenged and made it the higher scoring one.
>Marlon_Hill_&_Bob_Linn: ELO B11 .OLE +22 153
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: DEHLO 10F HO.EL +40 330
#note I don't remember the full rack, but I know we had a D, because I was seriously in favor of EDH 15A to take out that spot.  However, Sammy preferred playing for points, and this play scored high enough that I acquiesced.  HOVED# was probably even better.

#note This play was all mine.  All three of the other players complimented me on it.

#note They debated between this and DECURY 8J.  Sammy pointed out that if they had played the other one, we almost had SHIRTILY# in response.
>Dave_Koenig_&_Sammy_Okosagah: HIILRST I3 SHIRT +14 522
#note At this point everyone else had lost interest, as they knew we had won, so I was just wrapping things up for sake of formality.  I couldn't find anything great, and Sammy misinformed me that LITH# was no good, so I settled for an easy out in two, completely missing their big play.

#note "Think long, think wrong!" Marlon said.  At least we still win.
