#note Debated this move for too long, wondering whether dropping the C at K2 (as opposed to the A with ACHOO and Q unseen) would be safer despite the EO vs EI leave. It isn't, and it wasn't that critical of a decision.

#note Missed CAGOT in the same place. This was more of a game killer than the CHIAO/ACHOO decision.
>Feargal: ?EEORSW L4 OW +19 314
>Lucas: CEIMORU 12N MU +13 307
#note A strategic error that I'm still working on. I sniffed out an S and bingo rack here after OW and felt compelled to cover my mistake. There is also OHMIC 3J, but I don't see how that leaves me room for recovery after O-column bingos. The best I can see it do is nullify his bingo with points and dig for the blank. Maybe that's best, I don't know.

>Lucas: CEINORY 8M .OY +18 325
#note I sensed that I needed a bingo to win, and I liked the prospects of opening a Y lane in addition to the open C, H, O and E with this leave, but this was really a panic play because I wanted to retain the E. YEP C13 scores significantly more and I should still have wiggle room with CINOR to score some and then bingo out.

#note An extra point for LUX I13.

>Lucas: ACEIKNR 12I K. +6 350
#note With TTTV unseen, I can see ACENTRIC, CREATION, and VICENARY possible if I dump the K. However, the K has to play at 14D, which I missed. KI loses to COMPT even if I pull one of the T's. I had time and just didn't add this up properly or look hard enough. 
>Feargal: ENOPTTT O4 POTT. +13 437
>Lucas: ACEEINR 3F INARC. +13 363
#note Sloppy endgame. I can save points by forcing an out-in-two with RACE 4F.
