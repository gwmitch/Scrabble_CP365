>Ross_B.: AENPRTX H7 PRETAX +46 46
>Matthew: CJKMNPU 11E UNJ.M +28 28
>Ross_B.: EHINNNS 10H .HEIN +17 63
#note For the rest of this game, you're going to see me bleed equity for forgetting the E-hook on this thing.
>Matthew: CDIKPQY K9 P.CKY +32 60
#note Hey Boo Boo! Let's go and wrangle us up some PYK(N)IC baskets! What a stupid word. So much for PICKY being the obvious play. (-8.0)
>Ross_B.: EENNOST 8B TENONE.S +59 122
>Matthew: DEEIQVW I6 QI. +18 78
#note QIS is best among plays that don't involve THEINE. But VIEWED is best. (-13.5)
>Ross_B.: DLLRSUU 12A DULLS +18 140
>Matthew: DEEIMVW A12 .IVE +24 102
#note VIEWED is still there, but now W(E)EVI(L)ED is the star play. (-18.8)
>Ross_B.: ILORTUU 6I .UOIT +16 156
>Matthew: DEEMOWY 7C YOWE +32 134
#note MEOWED and WEEDY hooking THEINE.  (-5.9)
>Ross_B.: ABILRSU N6 SLURBIA +84 240
>Ross_B.: ABILRSU --  -84 156
>Matthew: AADEFMW 13I WA.ED +32 166
#note *WAYED. For some reason I talked myself out of FAYED and into this. Oh well. FAYED is better anyways. (-1.1)
>Ross_B.: ABILRSU 5K BLUR +24 180
>Matthew: AEFGIMT O5 TAME +25 191
#note Ross sets up his S and forces me to play suboptimally to block it. I'm not sure I can afford to leave it open.
>Ross_B.: AHILRSZ M2 HAL..Z +56 236
#note Oof. Nice find.
>Matthew: EFGINTT 2J FIG.T +40 231
>Ross_B.: BCFIORS 1H FRO +23 259
>Matthew: ?DEGNST 3E NiDGETS +69 300
#note When comparing this to STANGED, I undercounted STANGED by 6 points and ended up choosing NIDGETS because of that. A potentially costly error. (-5.0)
>Ross_B.: BCIIIIS M11 BI.I +7 266
#note A tragic III draw by Ross.
>Matthew: AGORRRV 14F ARVO +14 314
#note 12 of 17 unseen are vowels, but I have to assume he's gotten close to a bingo. I haven't forgotten that S he's been clutching since SLURBIA*.
>Ross_B.: ACDIIOS 1M CAD +41 307
#note ACID is a costly miss there.
>Matthew: AEEEGRR 4A EAGRE +16 330
#note I'm not sure what to make of this play. In hindsight, throwing away two consonants when I'm looking to draw possibly three vowels is very irresponible. (J)EE(R) leaving one in the bag looks interesting. My plan with EAGRE was to block the bingo lanes and give me my best chance at going out next turn. EAGRE appears to block Ross's bingos if he's holding NSAAIO?, but it doesn't stop SINOpIA. I dunno, I feel like there was another way to go about this.
>Ross_B.: ?AIIOOS 2B ArIOSI +23 330
#note Ross isn't seeing my out play. ARIOSI holding the O for JO or KOI is nice, though.
>Matthew: AENOR C10 RE.OAN +12 342
#note Whew.
>Matthew:  (O) +2 344
