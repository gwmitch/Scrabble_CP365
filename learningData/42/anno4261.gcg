>harry: ?AEKLRT 8C sTALKER +72 72
#note RATLiKE for 80 is best. It puts the K on the 2L and avoids offering any hooks.
>moh: ELNOOSY J2 LOONEYS +75 75
#note The only bingo and the only spot for it.
>harry: AFIT K3 FIAT +27 99
>moh: EEMNORV E2 OVERME.N +76 151
#note I thought I could get away with this phony - after all, there are so many OVER- words. But it was an unnecessary risk. VENOMER(S) plays from C1.
>harry: AEH D4 HAE +28 127
>moh: BEGIISX F1 EX +50 201
#note Easily best, despite keeping the doubled Is that would end up plaguing me.
>harry: ADRY G2 YARD +22 149
>moh: BGIIINS I7 B.ING +22 223
#note Why shed the N? I should have played B(R)IG in the same spot as B(R)ING, keeping IINS instead of IIS.
>harry: ABG L5 BAG +14 163
>moh: IIIORSU 11I .UIRO +12 235
#note This is a very close call between enchanging and my play of (G)UIRO. My play wins the sim. In general, I prefer to play through borderline racks when I'm ahead and exchange when I'm behind. Since I'm ahead, I went ahead and tried to work through the vowels. 
>harry: CDERW M9 CR.WED +30 193
>moh: EIIIOPS -IIO +0 235
#note This is my third rack in a row with triplicate Is, and it's finally time to trade. I thought about D8 (T)IPI, but the unseen Ss make that setup too risky, especially since I'm still keeping a 3:1 vowel-consonant ratio. I think my exchange is probably best.
>harry: AO L10 O.A +18 211
>moh: EINOPSW F8 .OW +16 251
#note I was disapponted that WINESOP didn't play anywhere. Nevertheless, the EINPS leave is very solid, and my play of (L)OW leaves a nice lane for a seven if I draw it. WIPE at M2 is also appealing.
>harry: ESU C3 USE +15 226
>moh: EIINOPS 11C PION +19 270
#note It's tempting to fish to the PONIES rack by playing off an I (do you notice a theme this game?), but PION is a reasonable way to score a little more and keep letters that I think should turn into a bingo before this game is over (that doesn't mean they did!).
>harry: IQS 12B QIS +32 258
>moh: EGILSUZ 13A ZIG +49 319
#note Harry socred well with his Q, but I can hit right back. In addition to my ZIG play, I also considered B12 (Q)UIZ 44. It's pretty close, but ZIG comes out on top.
>harry: DE A13 .ED +39 297
>moh: ELOSTUU 14L U.O +8 327
#note My play might look like a kamikaze move, but there was a reason for it: Other than my Us, I'm very close to a bingo, but the lanes are running out on this board. If harry bingos from 15A or to 14M, this is a bingo-dead board. By playing UDO, I create a lane down the O column and across row 15. If harry takes one of them and I don't draw the immediate bingo, I thought I could still open a lane down column A and have two draws for my bingo. I'm not sure if my play was best, but it wasn't terrible, mostly because absolutely nothing stands out here.
>harry: EIPTT 15H PETIT +27 324
>moh: AEILSTU O11 ALIST +23 350
#note I'm close to a bingo, but if I fish off again, but with only one hot lane on this board, I elect to take the lead by killing it and hope to win this one in the bingo-less endgame. With no bingo lanes, the unseen blank doesn't worry me much.
>harry: AHJ B5 HAJ +22 346
>moh: CEENRUV M1 CURVE +26 376
#note This is a very interesting position. I can't do anything about the possibility of Harry playing from A1 down to S(HEAR), so I figure the best I can do is score as well as possible and hope to go out on my next play, which should be enough. Whether or not I can go out will depend on my draw, but EN isn't a terrible combo to draw two tiles to.
>harry: ?ADFILN A1 NAIFs +40 386
#note Harry played this endgame well, hitting NAIFs for 40 and leaving two places to go out with LD. However, NAIFs loses if I see a really cool response. Hint: The best play for Harry is O8 FIN(ALIST) for 33 points.
>moh: EMNT K10 T.N +12 388
#note Oh, the glory that could have been! The star play here is MENT(ALIST) for 33 and the win! But I just didn't see it, even though I know the word (I guess since there's now a prime time show called The Mentalist, it's not an obscure word anymore). I hoped that harry didn't see the more difficult out play from 1F and decided to block the other one (L(OR)D at 10K). My play wins as long as harry doesn't see the star out play.
>harry: DL 1F .LD +21 407
#note Excellent out play, Harry! Congrats on a well deserved win!
>harry:  (EM) +8 415
