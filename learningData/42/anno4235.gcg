#note GOUT sims best, but it's hard to argue with success.

#note Bad error. I lamented the lack of a spot for DECIARE, but missed it as a non-bingo 2x2. Punishment was swift.

#note Back in the game! Not for long, though.

#note Carl says: "READINGS F2 is better, although it makes things a little too interesting." Not sure I follow - I'd be happy to take the extra 6 points.
>Bing: AHKNNNP E3 NAN +24 233
#note This was a mistake - NAPKIN M8 is clearly best.

#note Awkward, but what else? A draw of EO would be nice!

#note "FAILURE or AURICLE J3 are better alternatives, although I can't seem to go wrong this game."

#note More misery. At least the HMP leave has some synergy.
>Carl: AEGINOS N2 GAO. +10 404
#note "Unwisely passing up ONAGRI (which I did see) to be needlessly defensive. My goal with GAOL is to block COLZA and set up the G for myself using the case N."

#note Ack. I guess I played this out of frustration. But WHIPT is clearly an improvement, or better yet WHAM/WHAP J3.

#note Missed PLOTZ J2.
