>David_Gibson: EIO 11E OE +18 30
#note He said it was between OE and OI, and that someone like Cree would play OI without thinking twice.  Defense versus offense.

>Ryan_Fischer: EEEFITU C7 FEE +14 181
#note Decent, 'cause I definitely don't want to leave 4 vowels to one consonant (although I didn't like opening the new lanes).

#note LOVELIER with an I, OVERSELL and VOLLEYER too, all of which I saw.
>Ryan_Fischer: EELLORV --  -76 271
#note Yeah, I really didn't need to push my luck there.  L(I)EVER or anything else in that spot woulda been fine.
>David_Gibson: CJOSUWY D1 JU.CY +50 261
#note Told me he left OSW.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAERRV J3 VARA +19 326
#note I don't see VERA(T)RiN even though for some reason I was thinking it earlier -- not sure if it was this game (maybe VERATRIA too).  It's between this and RAVE, and I didn't want to chance the B hook on brave.  Also, there's already an A to play through down low.
