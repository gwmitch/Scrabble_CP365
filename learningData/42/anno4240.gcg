#note The reaction when I played this was priceless.  "Whoa, that's about 50," he estimated, before I finished counting.  Plays like this are what I love.
>David_Gibson: LTZ F7 L.TZ +33 63
#note Must not've had anything else, and this hotspot won't ever get used.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIPTT B9 APT +31 121
#note I have a PATHETIC PITTANCE (APATETIC/CAPITATE, which I didn't know, too).  My first thought was to play something like CATE, setting up the P/EON hook, but this is much better.
>David_Gibson: HIN 9F .HIN +23 86
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEITX J5 AXITE +36 157
#note Turning point of the game.  He said he'd probably play EXACT or AXITE, too.  Tough decision.  EXACT opens the bottom, but keeps it more closed in general when I'm ahead.  He'll still have the EXACT/A hook, but I'll be able to counter most bingos.  Sim likes EX.  I think I went with AXITE also because on the off chance I pull a U, I have ECU parallel to MY.  Probably not too big a concern there, and I should leave that part of the board alone.

#note All of Quackle's suggestins are stupid.  Given the hole I dug, this is fine.
>David_Gibson: IILLNOR G3 I.OL +6 235
#note He told me he had (T)RILLION off a T.  I don't think Quackle appreciates the brilliance of this move.  It undoubles, and it restricts three hotspots: S/TAW, K/LUTZ, and 8H (though I do use it later anyway).
