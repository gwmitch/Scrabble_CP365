>Brian: ENOZ 8E ZONE +26 26
>Mike: ABKOPRS D7 KOB +25 25
#note Percentage points behind BORK I6.
>Brian: AEHNSV I3 HAVENS +32 58
>Mike: ADEEPRS 5D DEPRA.ES +106 131
#note I first saw this as PRESAVED*, then PERVADES, then this.
>Brian: AJOT 4A JOTA +44 102
>Mike: LNNORTX 6I .XON +54 185
#note LEX 6H sims about 4 points better, despite scoring one less and keeping doubled Ns. I guess the vowel really is that important.
>Brian: ADINW 3B DIWAN +32 134
>Mike: ILNRTTV 4H T.V +23 208
#note Virtually tied with LAV in this spot. Is the L really that bad a tile--as bad as a second T?
>Brian: ELOU A4 .OULE +36 170
>Mike: EILNRRT E8 .INE +30 238
#note An instructive position. With racks like this, I prefer to either go for a high probability fish (something like DOR B3), or else blow up the rack for a bunch of points (like my actual choice). It depends on the game situation and the opponent. What I don't like is scoring mediocrely and keeping a mediocre leave; naturally, TILER or TIRL at B6 win the sim. Comments?
>Brian: DIIM B6 MIDI +28 198
>Mike: ?LRRRTU 11B RUL.R +5 243
#note Virtual dead heat with RUT 2A. LRR? isn't my idea of a dynamic leave, but 12 points is 12 points. I'd still play RULER, though.
>Brian: AY 7D .AY +29 227
>Mike: ?AIORST M2 AORISTs +76 319
#note An improvement over ARIsTOS M3, as the 8L-O comebacks hurt more.
>Brian: BGIMY 2J BIG.MY +40 267
>Mike: AEGIILS 1G GLIA +19 338
#note Just barely ahead of SOILAGE K5 and AGILE L8. With 5 Es to draw, I guess that makes sense, but I need to start playing defense.
>Brian: IUUW -IUUW +0 267
>Mike: AEEISTU O1 A.E +18 356
#note Best. Keeping with the defensive theme.
>Brian: ?CDEILN L8 INLaCED +72 339
#note Good thing, too; this would've been CYLINDEr trip-trip if I hadn't blocked. Brian said afterwards that he considered INCLuDE N8, but decided it was too "Custer's Last Stand" for him. Quackle disagrees, even if we infer the last S on my rack.
>Mike: EFISTUU M13 FEU +25 381
>Brian: ACERT N10 CRATE +40 379
>Mike: HIPRSTU 12C HIS +36 417
#note Five plays, including HA at E2 (threatening a big play at 1A), are listed at 100%. This play isn't listed at all by CP, but I like the way the endgames sets up: I'm guaranteed at least two places for the Q if I draw it (QUIT C1, QUA E1, QIS 8J). If Brian has the Q, it has to go at 8J for 11, and as long as I've drawn a vowel, I should have an out-in-two. Plus, even if I'm wrong, 38 points is a lot to make up.
>Brian: EEFGOOW K8 WEE +15 394
#note K10 EF is 15 better, according to Quackle. See next play for the reason why this (threatening GOOF) doesn't work.
>Mike: PQRTTU C1 QU.. +13 430
#note PARR at 11K, blocking GOOF and still threatening QUIT and QUA, is 26 better. However, Brian's clock read 0:00 at this point, so I just wanted to make dead sure of the win (and even if I'd seen PARR, I wouldn't have been 100% on it).
>Brian: FGOO J10 GOOF +20 414
#note -10 (time); final score 430-416.
>Brian:  (PRTT) +12 426
