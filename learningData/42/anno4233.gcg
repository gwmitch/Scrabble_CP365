>Jason: ADEMNYZ G8 ZANY +31 31
>Steve_Krieger: EIPP I6 PIPE +40 64
>Jason: ADEEMMO H11 ADEEM +35 66
#note I considered MOME or MEMO at F9, but didn't think ADE was eight points better than MO. MOME/MEMO sims about a point ahead. (shrugs) (-1)
>Steve_Krieger: OUY G13 YOU +25 89
>Jason: ADEMOOW F12 MAW +36 102
#note So focused on the fact that I had a W for that TLS, I missed MOW for the same score at I11. Bad miss. (-5)
>Steve_Krieger: BI F9 BI +16 105
>Jason: ADELOOO E9 ALOE +22 124
>Steve_Krieger: EFH D12 FEH +34 139
>Jason: DHLOOSU C13 HOD +29 153
#note DUO, same spot, says Duck. A bit counter-intuitive, although it could set up a nice OH play next turn. (-1.4)
>Steve_Krieger: ADS 15A DA.S +32 171
#note Hey! A horizontal play! (When playing anybody but Bowman or Krieger, that was accomplished on the opening move.) :)
>Jason: ELOSSUV J3 VOLES +28 181
#note Saw OVULES a second after hitting the clock. Had a nasty feeling it might come back to bite me. Damn round 15 fatigue. (-10.7)
>Steve_Krieger: IIIII -IIIII +0 171
>Jason: AEJORSU J9 RAJ +20 201
#note Maybe FPS. I just didn't like JOES at B10, even though it leads sim. (-3)
>Steve_Krieger: EKR 11J .ERK +30 201
>Jason: EIOSSUU -IOUU +0 201
#note Ooh, U(V)EOUS! Studied the 4v6es, but don't recall that one. This sims second. (-10)
>Steve_Krieger: GOO M8 GOO. +10 211
>Jason: ELORSSU N11 SOUL +24 225
#note Naturally, after dumping the two U's, the first tile I look at is the case U. Sims best.
>Steve_Krieger: ETX 3J .EXT +28 239
>Jason: DEEIORS B7 OREIDES +66 291
#note As I started putting this down, Steve gave a "yeah, I figured" shrug. When I finished, I thought I saw him pause. It told me (correctly) that both blanks were in the bag. I felt like if I could draw just one, I'd win the game.
>Steve_Krieger: CERTU A5 CUTER +31 270
#note Then I had a mini-meltdown. As Steve pondered this play, I noticed I put GOOK and VEXT under my score and SOUL and OREIDES under Steve's (I didn't notice because the score was 201-201 before the sequence). I then started to panic. I asked to stop the clock to fix it and Steve took me through the past few plays (I'd forgotten about my exchange four). I got everything square and asked if it was OK to start again. "OK," Steve said in a "chillax, dude" tone. And indeed, this is not the play of someone holding a blank.
>Jason: ABINRRV C3 BRAIN +20 311
#note Trying to block bingos and turn over. I felt like if I could stop Steve from bingoing, I could win, maybe even without a blank. Indeed, Steve picked a blank after CUTER and later said this blocked a bingo. RAVIN or INVAR might be better ... B is better to make parallel plays. But I liked making the B the only line to bingo through, as opposed to an I or R. (-4)
>Steve_Krieger: CIN 4I C.NI +32 302
>Jason: EILRTTV L10 T.IVET +22 333
#note Sims best. More turnover/blocking FISh-like plays at 15L. I knew after my mini-meltdown that the "low fuel" light in my brain was definitely on ... but knew a blank draw here and the game was all but over. I tried to get myself to focus for a few more minutes.
>Steve_Krieger: ?AGINNT 4A AI.TiNG +25 327
#note Steve basically said in the post-mortem that this was a give-up play. He assumed I had the other blank, and every opening play (like (G)IN or (G)AN) gave him no chance to outrun after an inevitable block. Sim says GIN wins 55% of the time, this 17%.
>Jason: FIILNRW A11 IF +21 354
#note R(EN)IN is four better, blocks his best out. I saw he needed 11 to tie and on this mess of a board, thought he might not have it.
>Steve_Krieger: ?GNU 5L sUNG +13 340
#note Until this. GU(EN)oN, which I didn't know, is six more. So frustrating.
>Steve_Krieger:  (ILNRW) +16 356
