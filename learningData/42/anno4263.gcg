>Kate: ?EGLLMY 8F ELMY +18 18
#note I like GYM, but un-doubling the L's has its merits.
>Evans: AANNSTW 7I AWN +13 13
#note Sigh... there's really nothing better than this.
>Kate: ?EEGILS H8 .ILEaGES +80 98
#note My shameless coffeehousing talks her out of playing GENTILES... I accept full responsibility for this.
>Evans: ?AFNOST L1 FANTOdS +83 96
#note I wrote down FONTINAS and FONTANAS* on my scoresheet, unsure of which one was a word. I opted to play it safe and do this instead. (I missed FONDANTS and NONFACTS, also -- and SEAFRONT 14G is a little better than my play as well.)
>Kate: DEINOTU 10E OUT.INED +63 161
>Evans: ACDEEIU 3G EUCAI.E +26 122
#note Ohhhh, nooooooooo. I just missed AUDIENCE, didn't I...
>Kate: AGOQRRS 1L .ROG +24 185
>Evans: DDEIORU 6H UDO +20 142
#note DENUDER K5 is awesome.
>Kate: ABEQRSZ 12D ZEBR. +30 215
#note Quackle likes SUQ H2! It seems crazy to ditch that S, but it makes sense -- ZEBRA is a stronger leave than it looks, and on this wide-open board, she's bound to score a ton next turn, S or no.
>Evans: CDEINRT H1 CR.D +27 169
#note Also, ZEBRA blocked my DICENTRA. Nice bonus.
>Kate: AIMQSTW 13C QAT +37 252
#note Looks right to me. The alternative is the J2 spot...
>Evans: AEHINRT 15A INEARTH. +86 255
>Kate: ABIIMNS 1C IAMBI. +13 265
#note Ooh, MINIBAR.
>Evans: LPPRRSY 2J PL.YS +54 309
#note yay!
>Kate: EEEFOSW 11K FOE +25 290
#note Gotta keep the rack balanced and keep scoring, right? This is probably better than FEW.
>Evans: DGOPRRU 5J PR.UD +24 333
#note Better leave with this than with DROOP or PROG...
>Kate: AEOOSTW 2D WOO +23 313
#note Nice leave, but bingoing on this board will be tricky. No S on PROUD, as I had thought.
>Evans: AGLORVV 3A VOLAR +27 360
#note If I want to avoid giving her back an easy scoring spot, OVAL 3B is much safer. The pool's got tons of vowels, so GRV isn't that bad a leave.
>Kate: AEEINST N8 ETESIAN +75 388
#note OK, so bingoing isn't impossible. Sigh.
>Evans: GIIJNVX O8 XI +56 416
#note NIX is better -- she's going to go out in two no matter what, so I had might as well dump the N while I still can. This is a ridiculous endgame -- everything looks great but loses. VEX sucks because she can block JIVING and go out in two, JIVING is bad because HA O8 can V-stick me... yeah, there's really nothing good to do here. Tough way to lose a game.
>Kate: AEHKT M13 KAT +28 416
#note This is the right idea, but KA M13 is a little better, setting up ETH for 28 and out next turn. Cool, huh? 
>Evans: GIJNV B2 J.G +22 438
#note JIG 9C is two points better.
>Kate: EH O14 EH +18 434
#note HE 14A is one point more.
>Kate:  (INV) +12 446
