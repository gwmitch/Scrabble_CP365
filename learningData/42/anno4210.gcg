>Matthew: ?AEIPUV 8F VAU +12 12
#note Why do I never pick the correct placement? I thought the V and U protected the A hotspot. I guess this doesn't sim best because of easy non-overlaps like J(A)W or Z(A)P or whatever? (-2.5)
>Sam_H.: HITW 9G WHIT +29 29
>Matthew: ?DEIPTU K3 DIsPUTE +79 91
#note I saw IMPUTED a couple turns later. No reason to put an S on the board. (-1.0)
>Sam_H.: BEIMO 10C BIOME +21 50
>Matthew: CDDEOTY 11E YOD +36 127
#note I did not spend long enough on this. The play looked great and I jumped on it without looking for better ones. DYED is best and TODDY is good too.
>Sam_H.: INOX 8K .OXIN +39 89
>Matthew: CDEGTTU 10K DUCT +20 147
#note Q says 3I DEDUCT? I'm not sure why. I feel like my play accomplishes more. What am I missing? (-4.4)

>Sam_H.: AHJ L12 HAJ +39 128

#note I made some of my favourite plays in this game.

>Matthew: GKLQRST 8A GR.K +42 261
>Sam_H.: COOT L1 COOT +25 178
>Matthew: AALNQST J2 QAT +39 300
#note I can do no wrong. My horrible 7-consonant parfait scores 42, and now Sam improves the Q play I had lined up.
>Sam_H.: ?AEGINU A1 lEAGUIN. +83 261
#note Nice find by Sam, but ooh... EUGENIA on the bottom row is nice.
>Matthew: AILNNSS 15K LIS +19 319
#note I don't know why I was so afraid of those hooks down there. I can just take out the big threat with H11 SNAIL. Also, did SIN just fall out of my head, or what? (-9.8)
>Sam_H.: AOZ 12A ZO.A +46 307
>Matthew: AALNRSS A10 LA.ARS +45 364
#note I could have been in trouble if I'd not had a play here.
>Sam_H.: ERW 1L .REW +27 334
>Matthew: EENNSSV 2A .VENNESS +76 440
#note I love this play so much. I'm not sure why.
