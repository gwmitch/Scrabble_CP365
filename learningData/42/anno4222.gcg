>Jason: EIIMOPS 8G POI +10 10
#note Sims best.
>Kelly_McKenzie: ?EINTUW 7G UNTWInE +72 72
#note In our round 2 game, Kelly went first and pulled RETAIN?. "At least I made you work harder for your opening blank bingo," I joked.
>Jason: ?EEIMNS K4 ENM.tIES +86 96
#note fEM(I)NISE sims better. (-2)
>Kelly_McKenzie: AAI 6J A.IA +18 90
>Jason: CDEEFJR L1 JEED +46 142
#note I got burned in a recent game vs. Hector on a play like this, putting the J in a triple lane. Maybe too ballsy. Sims best, but I like J(E)FE, which leads in valuation by a fraction of a point.
>Kelly_McKenzie: AGINRTW 10H WAT.RING +66 156
#note Again, all future opponents of mine should overdraw if they need to bingo. Kelly did, co-mingled, I looked at AEI and threw the E back. Bingo. Le sigh... (RINGTAWS and TWANGIER are probably better.)
>Jason: CCFIIRZ J2 FIZ +36 178
#note Missed F(R)IZ, L9. (-3)
>Kelly_McKenzie: DOU 1L .UDO +36 192
>Jason: CCEIRTT M9 C.TER +20 198
#note Missed C(I)TRIC. (-6)
>Kelly_McKenzie: BRV 12L V.RB +24 216
#note "Thanks for the vowel," Kelly said during the recount.
>Jason: ACDINOT O4 COATIN. +39 237
#note Or DO(ZED) or CANTDO(G).
>Kelly_McKenzie: AADMNOR 11D MADRONA. +81 297
#note Only playable, held and released. Nice find from Kelly.
>Jason: ADEEHPT 12C PEH +29 266
#note Sims best.
>Kelly_McKenzie: AKQUY 6C QUAKY +39 336
>Jason: ADEHOOT O12 .OHO +27 293
#note Whoa, HO(N)O(R)ED at N8 would've been sweet. But this leads in wins. (-3)
>Kelly_McKenzie: EFIN 7B FINE +24 360
>Jason: ADEEGLT 13B LEGATED +90 383
#note Still a ray of hope. C'mon, X! C'mon, S's!
>Kelly_McKenzie: ELX I1 LEX +40 400
>Jason: BILORSY 1F BYR. +27 410
#note In hindsight, BILL setting up Y plays. We re-played the endgame after BILL, though, and I don't think it wins given that I drew OUR and left V. Would've been nice to see (WO)O(D)SY, too. (-7)
>Kelly_McKenzie: AEGLSST 8A GAS +29 429
#note CP says (PE)G wins 100% of the time with a valuation of 100+ (to 7/8 for this). Must be a lot of unblockable out bingos after PEG.
>Jason: ILOORSU 14I LOURS +15 425
#note OLIO at 12G (which I saw) is six better. I wanted guaranteed outs in two, but Kelly isn't going to block (B)URS anyway.
>Kelly_McKenzie: ELSTV 9D VETS +18 447
#note LEV, 12H, is eight better.
>Jason: IO 12H OI +15 440
#note Fun game, played well, just didn't win.
>Jason:  (L) +2 442
