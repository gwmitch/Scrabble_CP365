#note Good call to wait on cashing the S hook. 
>Bing: EEIIIRY 10I EY.IE +16 154
#note Pretty weak. Obviously, I was worried about the S spot, but this only makes it slightly harder to use.

#note No definite favorite among the possibilities here - MATT and GAM are about as good. FAGOT might work out too: clearly the best leave, with GAM in reserve.

#note I missed badly here. CAHOW 12A keeps a great leave and avoids emptying the bag.
>Nathan: EEJNPUU 3K .UNUP +16 418
#note Rare to see an endgame phony succeed in swinging the result, but that's just what happened here. I was so thoroughly beguiled that I didn't see the point in challenging. Of course, Nathan could have won with the pedestrian play of UNPURE 4A, but where's the fun in that?
