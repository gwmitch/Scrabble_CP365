>Steve: AEINOOZ 8E OOZE +26 26
#note One turn in and we have our first major error. Never saw ZONAE, and seeing it now, can't honestly say I would have recognized it to be a word if I had. Yet more proof that this is a young man's game.
>Zeigler: AAEEJTU 7C JUT +20 20
#note I hated this rack, and this play, But at this point, I was dead tired, and rather stupidly thought that I should make a B play difficult. Which my play doesn't actually accomplish. Duck likes AJEE 9B, which I considered. I didn't consider 9F EAT, which I actually really like.
>Steve: AAGINSU I2 IGUANAS +75 101
>Zeigler: AADEEWW 9F WAD +28 48
#note drawing into AAEE, i suppose it could have been worse. I considered duck's choice of WAW, but I like my play. At this point, I am less concerned about dumping both Ws and more concerned about maximizing points, and not surrendering quite so much in return as WAW at j5.
>Steve: DEFIRST J1 IF +26 127
#note In a less-disciplined moment I may have tried to get away with STRIFED*.
>Zeigler: ACEEEPW 10D WEEP +33 81
#note During the game I had the feeling Pete was holding back an S. Silly me.
>Steve: ?DEKRST 5E STRE.KeD +98 225
#note Pick two, draw a blank. That's talent, folks.
>Zeigler: ACEEQTU 4A QUATE +50 131
#note After Steve's last play, I no longer have the slightest compunction about throwing the board open. I did consider QUATE f2, but that was just way too aggressive.
>Steve: ABFLOOY 4L OFAY +34 259
#note I was going to play FLOO(D)Y* before I came to my senses and found this. The board is now officially open for big plays.
>Zeigler: CDENNOU K5 .NOUNCED +70 201
#note Nice find. I wasn't sure of it, but it seemed plausible and the score and Pete's body language told me not to challenge.
>Steve: ?ABLMOV 3L MOB +34 293
#note I saw the bingo MOVEABLe, but didn't like opening a third 3x3 line. Plus it wasn't enough points. If I see MOVEABLy, maybe I play it, maybe not. But my play is the Duck's choice, regardless.
>Zeigler: EIINNSS C7 .INS +22 223
#note There goes Pete, doubling up his rack again, this time three times over.
>Steve: ?AAEILV 12G VALI.AtE +74 367
#note I felt pretty good about my winning chances after this play. Silly me.
>Zeigler: EEGINOS O7 GENOISE +90 313
#note Another one of those newer words that I would have trouble finding if it were on my rack. But Pete is a young guy and has no such problem, giving me more work to do before I can put this one to bed.
>Steve: ABGHIOY N8 BAY +35 402
#note I had an internal debate here between playing B2 BOUGH, or one of a few choices I had in this spot. Once I realized all the Us were gone and I didn't have to worry about a 3x3, I chose this spot. Duck likes BOUGH, but I can't justify not only leaving the M column open to bingos, but also opening a new line in the A column. 
>Zeigler: EHILLRX 3C HILL +29 342
#note I catch a break here, as Pete misses a 61-point play. He's probably dizzy from seeing duplicate tiles - as I see he didn't have one full rack this game without at least one duplicate tile.
>Steve: GHIOOTV 11D OH +25 427
#note Duck prefers HOT, 13H, ever so slightly to my play. 
>Zeigler: EINRRTX H11 T.XER +36 378
#note I was hoping Pete would panic and open a line for me to play my natural seven. Instead he scores and makes me face some difficult choices.
>Steve: EGIORTV 12B VIG +28 455
#note So OVERGIRT is good. I saw it, but wasn't all that sure of it, and this is no time to lose a challenge. I figure I can put this game in the deep freeze by taking out the bingo line, and lay down V(E)RTIGO. Then I notice the possibility of QINTAR, and how that would pull him dangerously close, and how I could get screwed by the bag. Better to try and outrun him. So this leads me to the D12 hot spot, and either VIG or GIVE. GIVE is four more points, but that's not enough to open an extra bingo line, or to let go of the valuable E. More importantly, if Pete does bingo, I want him to draw four from the bag and not three, making it harder for him to go out on his following turn.
>Zeigler: AEIINRT 14A INERTIA. +70 448
#note I quickly play the bingo, as steve is a little short on time. Duck says the winningest play is NINE 6I. Interesting gambit. Of course, that counts on Steve not blocking the obvious bingo line. LI I12 also beats the bingo. I still think that against a real live human being, I have to bingo.
>Steve: CELORRT M7 ROC +22 477
#note I was fortunate to pick the last vowel out of the bag. There are wins with most other pick combinations, but they're fewer and harder to find. The only for-sure loss is if I pick the M and leave the O in the bag. N1 CO(BA)LT would have been nice to find, but that's not likely since I'm down to under a minute left on my clock.
>Zeigler: DMPR A13 D.P +18 466
#note I was expecting this or DIM.
>Steve: ELRT H1 ER +12 489
#note I saw the potential out play of TALER, but wasn't positive it was good. LATER I didn't see, nor RATEL. 
>Zeigler: MR N3 ..RM +14 480
#note This was better than anything I saw, and best, but falls just short. Well played by Pete, who got the short end of the stick in this contest.
>Zeigler:  (LT) +4 484
