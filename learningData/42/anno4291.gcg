#note Ross Brown annotating.
#note I didn't pass; this is just how I annotate games where I start second.

>Webster_Phillips: AEILRTT I2 LATERIT. +68 180
#note Bango.
#note Webster was probably thinking that I2 LITERAT(E) risked a front A hook, so chose this instead.  Read on...
>Ross_Brown: ADEGORT H1 GATED +34 171
#note Improbably, Webster's last play denied me four bingos:  I2 DEROGAT(E), J8 O(U)TRAGED, 4H GAR(R)OTED, and 5C GAROTED.
#note What I didn't know is that ELATERITE is a word, so I missed 1D GAROTED +92/229.

>Webster_Phillips: IMPW 5C WIMP +28 334
>Ross_Brown: AEEORTV 4A VETO +33 260
#note Best.
#note Webster had closed the board to prevent bingos like OVEREAT/OVERATE.

>Ross_Brown: AAENOOR 2B ANOA +22 282
>Webster_Phillips: BBJ D12 J.BB +36 384
#note I think this was a pretty smart play, not knowing what his other tiles were.
>Ross_Brown: DEENOOR 15D .O +4 286
#note Now things get strategically interesting.
#note Among the unseen tiles is the poisonous Q, but also a V that will give me 12F (O)VERDONE and the win if I'm lucky.
>Webster_Phillips: AHIMSUV -  +0 384
#note In point of fact, Webster held the V I wanted.  He opted to pass rather than risk that I might bingo out with him holding the Q and other garbage, possibly winning the game.  He later told me that his tracking wasn't perfect.
>Ross_Brown: DEENOQR -  +0 286
#note From the two remaining tiles, I drew the Q.  There was no place for it.
#note My best option at this point, I thought, is to keep a poker face and pass back so that Webster will continue to fear drawing the Q.  In this way, I'd minimize the damage done to my spread.
>Webster_Phillips: AHIMSUV -  +0 384
>Ross_Brown: DEENOQR -  +0 286
>Webster_Phillips: AHIMSUV -  +0 384
#note After several minutes, Webster checked with me to confirm what would happen to our scores if the game were to pass out, and again he passed.
>Ross_Brown: DEENOQR -  +0 286
#note Mission accomplished.  But I still lost by 100.  :-)
>Ross_Brown: DEENOQR (DEENOQR) +-17 269
