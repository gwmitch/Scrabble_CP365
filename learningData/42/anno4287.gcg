#note Quackle likes FETAL, but it's about the same.

>Noah_: BEISSTY M2 BYS +36 77
#note Quackle prefers BYTES or BYTE, so keeping EIST isn't worth it here.
>Travis_Chaney: ADORT 1L DART +30 73
>Noah_: AEIOSTT I5 TO.. +9 86
#note Definitely looks better to play IOTA 6F. Didn't think of cashing the S until next turn, STOAI is also better. Also TACO.

#note No hold from him. I had no idea if this was good or not. Conrad had just joked about TRAWING* being the real one in RINGTAW, and I had known it was a joke, but I didn't know if the joke meant that TRAW was good or that TRAW wasn't good.

#note Missed IWIS until my next turn. But I kind of like this better anyway, as it closes up all bingo lanes.
