#note Missing TRAIK. Quackle prefers TRIJUGATE to this, as it sets up a better KAVA, a thought that didn't even cross my mind while I was looking at TRIJUGATE. I was a little surprised that KIVA simmed better than this.

#note Missing two better dumps, TINFUL and UNJOINT, boh of which do just what I want.

#note I realized a couple moves later that I missed the A(MUS) hook. What I didn't realize was that ROADIeS played on the bottom!
>Dielle_Saldanha: EHINNOT D2 TH.ONINE +62 250
>Noah: IMPRTUY 1K PURTY +38 285
#note Quackle likes PUTTY, I guess because it blocks the E hook and keeps a very nice leave.

#note A set up which really isn't very good. Something like SHOES O3 is nice here, although I didn't know UNFITS. This does kinda force her to break up her rack to block.
>Dielle_Saldanha: AEEEINY 9A NE +10 364
#note Best is the nice WEENIE, which blocks and goes out next turn.
>Noah: DEGOSX O4 OXES +31 449
#note GOS O5 is best.
>Dielle_Saldanha: AEEIY F2 EY.IE +12 376
#note A little better to play EYE 5G.
>Noah: DG 10J ..G +13 462
#note BLIND is one better, as this gives her GAD/KATA.
