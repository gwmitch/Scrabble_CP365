>Bradley: AEIKNRS L7 SNAKIER +80 99
>Joey: EIOPTWY 13H TOWERY +26 77
#note At least three moves are a little better.  K11 PYE, L1 PEWIT, and 4H WETLY.  This wasn't that bad, though.

#note DOPS!  I didn't think long enough of playing through a vowel.
>Bradley: BEHRTTV N1 OBVERT +26 218
#note BERTHA is a little better.

>Bradley: AAEHTUW F2 HAET +34 252
>Joey: AAEIMPT K11 MAE +20 223
#note No standout plays here.  Maybe PATTIE.

#note The only bingo.

>Joey: DDIIRST 14C STAIDER +27 342
#note This was my first instinct, even with all the dreck unseen.  Maybe IDS results in some less dreadful endgame racks.  This was definitely a brain exploder.
>Bradley: AHIJLLZ 1D ZA +21 353
>Joey: DIOOUUV D8 OI +14 356
#note OOUUV was not a good draw.  I think if I had left any tile in the bag except for the E, I would pull this out, but it just wasn't meant to be.
