>Noah_: ?CEEEOR 8F CEE +10 10
#note Quackle prefers CEE 8G better, I played this because it seemed like X comebacks weren't as bad. In hindsight, the other placement gives slightly worse comebacks without the X, and the X isn't the only tile to be worried about.
>Carl_Johnson: BDEFIVZ F6 BI.E +14 14
>Noah_: ?EEORSV 10B OVERSEe +74 84
#note Quackle likes OVERuSE, which I missed, but I don't like it that much, as it is a little more of a shootout type of play than I'd like.
>Carl_Johnson: ?BEHINS 5C BEHINdS +82 96
#note A nice hook. NEBbISH might be a slightly better play.

#note This is where it gets interesting. This is a tough lane to block, and the T is also open, of course. Keeping the AN with only one other hook unseen seemed good. One problem is that he just drew 6, and the A is quite a possible draw. The thing is, he can't do too much blocking unless he has something like LAV or TAV. Even then, he can't block bingos through the T. I simmed it many-ply, and Quackle likes DOE L4, which just seems stupid, as Carl can easily destroy the board after that, and I have to hope for a Q-stick, which doesn't look likely with the pool. I like this play, but there are certainly other options. What do others think?
>Carl_Johnson: GOOU O6 OU.GO +6 366
>Noah_: ADEGNRR 2E GNARRED +67 408
#note It worked!
>Carl_Johnson: ALOTUUW 13J OUT +13 379
#note Carl, low on time, makes a play that blocks a Q spot and V(E)LDT, but it isn't a good enough one. Correct here is LUAU 13L, which doesn't block V(E)LDT, but leaves a strong out afterwards. LUAU is the only winning play.
>Noah_: DLMQTV 8C Q. +11 419
#note I miss Q(A)T and D(E)M(E), also short on time. 
>Carl_Johnson: ALUW 1J WAUL +16 395
#note Phew.
