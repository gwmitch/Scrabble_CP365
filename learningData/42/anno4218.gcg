#note Ulu: "No, I'm pretty sure cOC(K)S will win the sim."
>Matthew: AEFNORT F3 NOR +7 47
#note Matthew: "Hmm... seems like your play is rather subpar when you're not drawing into easy U bingos."

#note Matthew: "I must say this game has been lacklustre. I've been forced to exchange twice. What's your excuse?"
>Mr_Ulu: ?EGHINO 11A HEmOG...IN +80 144
#note Ulu: "Oh, I can score points whenever I want to. Just sort of toying with you at this point. Watching you bow down to my awesome U power."

#note Ulu: "Listen, scrub, you got lucky once, but you're well on your way to losing this one. So maybe you shouldn't be the one offering advice."

#note Matthew: "I'm just saying... karma's a bitch..."
>Mr_Ulu: ADINRWW O5 WIND....RAW +212 457
#note Ulu: "It would appear so."
>Matthew: AGOUUYZ N4 ZA +16 145
