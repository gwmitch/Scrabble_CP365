#note ROGUeRY. (missed bingos: 1) Also I don't know GURRY. Useful looking word. (-27.9)

>Matthew: ?EERSUU G7 ..UE +6 22
#note I saw three potential eights, but missed the obvious seven. (missed bingos: 2). Quackle suggests 9F USE and USER being a bit better than AGUE, but I don't like those at all.

#note SUBERIC is another option.

#note INDEED same spot wins the sim. Okay. Fishy plays like N13 DEB and J5 DEMY also sim well. I didn't realise how strong DEILN was. (-1.7)

>Matthew: AEFLTUY F2 FLU.Y +27 222
#note Ah, I missed the two nice plays from the V: VATFUL and VAULTY. My play just barely edges those out, though.
>Chris_L.: EIVX H1 VIXE. +48 241
>Matthew: ?AEGGIT 10J .IG +11 233
#note 11H GIE wins the sim. Hmm... I'm not sure I understand why. In hindsight, I think I like JAG for setting up an ING bingo. (-1.1)
>Chris_L.: BKSU M8 BUSK +23 264

#note This play doesn't make any sense. (-18.5)
>Chris_L.: AEINTW C8 .AWNTIE +33 297
>Matthew: ?AEGMPT B13 AMP +24 271
#note This play needs to be one square higher. (-2.6)
>Chris_L.: AEEEILS 3F .E. +11 308
#note I think this is a very interesting position.Chris has to choose between trying to block my bingo, or trying to respond withone of his own. Given my plays, he can likely peg me for S and/or ?. But if thebag contains two of ENRT, blocking is a very real possibility. I like LEX. With what's unseen, blocking just looks too unlikely.
>Matthew: ?EGOOST N2 STOOdGE +68 339
#note None of my valid plays block Chris's VASELINE. I don't knowhow I convinced myself this was valid. Geez.
