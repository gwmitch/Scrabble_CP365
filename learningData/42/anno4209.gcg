#note I thought the O would create a safe hotspot because of the Q, but it's better to do the other placement to surround the hotspot with vowels. (-2.9)

#note This is one of many spread-killers I played in this tournament. And considering that the benefactor of this blunder was the player who ended up outspreading me, I can safely say this move cost me second place. GO fishes for a bingo that doesn't exist.
