>Brian_Bowman: AEHRV H4 HAVER +30 30
>Jason: ABGIOTT G7 BOG +20 20
#note Or BOAT. Duck also suggests BIGOT, I1, which I'd never play. (-2)
>Brian_Bowman: ADPRU 4C PURDA. +24 54
>Jason: AIINTWZ E4 .ITZ +26 46
#note Ooh, totally missed NAZI, F8. Whoops. Board vision fail, apparently. (-10)
>Brian_Bowman: DSTUY 8A STUDY +50 104
#note Rightly punished.
>Jason: AEIINTW 6B WAI. +15 61
#note Duck likes WI(T), B6. I really feel like that's overvaluing the AEINT leave, esp. given the rate we're playing consonants at. (-3.5)
>Brian_Bowman: AGINO A2 GONIA +15 119
>Jason: AEEINTU I7 EAU +14 75
#note Fishing into TINE, take two, and ... action!
>Brian_Bowman: DIV 5H .VID +16 135
>Jason: CEINSTT J4 T.C +11 86
#note Or (BEE)T. And yes, I'm aware that scoring 86 in five turns is not a recipe to beat Bowman (or anyone).
>Brian_Bowman: EEJ 3I JEE +24 159
>Jason: EEIMNST 10A EMETINS +74 160
>Brian_Bowman: ?EFIMRX L1 FIRM +37 196
#note Brian's exact rack. Duck likes FIX, 11A.
>Jason: ACLLOSY M3 SALLY +52 212
>Brian_Bowman: AEHLX A10 .XHALE +60 256
>Jason: ACNORRR B1 COR +18 230
#note Did not know the sixes Duck recommends: (T)ROCAR, (G)ARRON and (G)ARCON. (-5)
>Brian_Bowman: ?DEEOOS 14A .OOSEnED +66 322
>Jason: AEILNRR 1L .LIR +21 251
#note Duck likes blowing it up with RENAIL at 15G. Almost did it, but couldn't stomach playing off a six-tile stem in this situation. If I want to go this route, FIRN is probably better with three N's out. (-11)
>Brian_Bowman: NOU H12 UN.O +18 340
>Jason: AEGINRW 13F AW. +20 271
#note Now it gets interesting (and naturally, my plays become questionable). It's obvious Brian didn't have the Q, so I felt like tying up Q spots and being fish-y was a good idea. Duck prefers WE, 13C. (-10)
>Brian_Bowman: EF F2 FE. +15 355
>Jason: BEGINOR 13C BO +18 289
#note Nooo! Chickened out on REBORING. Might have won if I'd played it, considering that I picked the blank here. (-71)
>Brian_Bowman: K D12 K.. +14 369
#note Nope, he still doesn't have the Q.
>Jason: ?EGINRT C13 ..G +6 295
#note Duck says its win percentage is better than bingoing, but it's wrong. Like my game vs. Joel in Arden, if Brian didn't draw the Q after KOS, he passes. I have to go on the 1-in-3 chance he picked it, so I may as well bingo from the R. (-19)
>Brian_Bowman: AEINOPT -  +0 369
#note A(U)TOPEN wins even if Brian draws the Q, but I like this.
>Jason: ?EINQRT 12H .NIQuER +30 325
#note Doesn't appear in Speedy's list, but input this and UNIQuE and they sim best, UNIQuE a little better. (-6.1)
>Brian_Bowman: AEINOPT N10 PA.TON +28 397
>Jason: NT 15G T.N +9 334
#note Would've been nice to bingo with REBORING and go into the endgame up two with ?NQT plus what Brian drew after KOS. Alas. I might've lost anyway.
>Jason:  (EI) +4 338
