#note JERK preferred - i wasn't sure at the time... also what's with my placement?  i made several errors in this game and got rewarded for all of them.
>Jason_G: ADD 9E DAD +23 23

>James_C: BMNORSY L6 MY +15 161
#note sometimes when playing in the intermediated division and being up >100 i think i go into a mode of playing for bingos.... which is bad.  I should have just gone with BONY or MONY  at L3. having said that, incorporating jason's rack, my play does a lot better but it's still not BONY/MONY.
>Jason_G: IL L3 LI +8 50
#note (FUSIL)LI is nice.

#note this wasnt in the top 10 but sims 2nd behind 10N WO.
>Jason_G: EOW N2 OWE +32 284
>James_C: ?IOORUV G12 .OU +4 478
#note this play is top and is over 25 value points higher than 2nd.   I noticed that there was so much I could do drawing 2 to this leave, leaving one in the bag, and opening up a bingo line which he can't utilize.  The o4 bingo line is a reserve if needed.

#note does anyone else remember this word because it is the maiden name of Marge Simpson?  Probably only me.    And like a flash, i get over the 600 mark.
