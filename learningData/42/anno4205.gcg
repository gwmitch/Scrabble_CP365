>Matthew: ADOPQSY 8G DOPY +20 20
>Kevin_T.: CHIOOR G2 CHOROI. +18 18
#note Kevin's word knowledge is better than most experts' in this field.
>Matthew: ADEEQSU 5D QUA.E +28 48
#note QUASHED was more points that I thought it was. QUARE still wins the sim, though.
>Kevin_T.: AEILW 3E AW.ILE +13 31
>Matthew: ADEJRSU 2I ADJURES +97 145
>Kevin_T.: ANRW 4J WARN +21 52
>Matthew: ACDEEMV 1L MADE +48 193
#note Definitely catching the breaks so far in this one.
>Kevin_T.: ?AINSTV H8 .VATIoNS +83 135
>Matthew: CDELNUV 11D DUVE. +18 211
#note I missed UNVEIL. (-2.2)
>Kevin_T.: BHOT 7J BOTH +20 155
>Matthew: CEELNNS 6F L.NE +12 223
#note I didn't like the look of CENSE or LENSE just yet. Also, I chickened out on plays hooking NOVATIONS. LONE sims decently, though. (-3.5)
>Kevin_T.: EELLU D5 .UELLE. +18 173
>Matthew: CEINNOS 7C N. +3 226
#note When I'm a good player, I'll be able to turn positions like this into CHINONES instead of 3-point fishes. NE is best among non-bingos, including the nifty DUVETINE. (-42.8)
>Kevin_T.: EFT 8M EFT +23 196
>Matthew: CEIINOS B4 NICOISE +70 296
#note Unfortunately, I didn't know the best play OSCININE. But I did see CONIINES, and I don't know what on earth possessed me to choose this play over CONIINES with the X unseen. I think my logic was that I would get the other triple? I dunno. Weak. (-9.8)
>Kevin_T.: AK A8 KA +38 234
>Matthew: FGIOTXY 9K FOX +42 338
#note 14D FOXING wins the valuation sim and is a full 2% higher to win. Makes sense. I should have been thinking to close the board with a lead like this. (-2.3)
>Kevin_T.: EMOTT A1 TOTEM +31 265
>Matthew: ?EGGITY 10G Y.G +12 350
>Kevin_T.: GIINRRS O7 S.IRRING +60 325
>Matthew: ?EGIIOT 15D EGOI.T +8 358
#note I saw the only bingo and was only about 70% sure of it. The only way I can lose this game is if I play a phony and if I don't know STIRRING takes an S. Not taking any chances. Lost a hundred billion equity, but sealed the win, so whatever.
