#note Somehow this only was scored as 76?  We'll see what happens when I Quackle the tie Chris and I had in the final round.
>Charles_Reinke: AADENTT 11E DATA +20 29
#note Considered 9G TAD keeping a friendly-looking AENT leave, but that play does horrible things to the bingo-friendliness of the board.

#note "Why doesn't that idiot just play B6 QI?" you may be asking.  Here's the answer: I didn't see it.
>Chris_Tallman: III -III +0 214
>Charles_Reinke: AAEEIQT -AEIQ +0 125
#note I miss QI again!  I saw it the next turn and was mad at myself the rest of the game.
>Chris_Tallman: DO 8N DO +16 230
>Charles_Reinke: AEPRSTW I12 .W +9 134
#note I feel like this is almost a guaranteed bingo next turn, but 13E WAP leaving ERST is too good to pass up.  I wasn't paying attention to the KAT(A) hook.

#note Held for a bit because it looks kinda stupid.
>Charles_Reinke: IILLPUX B6 XI +27 239
#note My master plan was to draw one of the three A's and one of the three R's, then play C3 PILULAR next turn.
>Chris_Tallman: BFI 14D FIB +31 328
>Charles_Reinke: IIILLPU C3 PILI +21 260
#note Master plan foiled.  Backup master plan: there is no backup master plan.  Good news: I'm now only down by a bingo.
>Chris_Tallman: BOY B2 YOB +24 352
>Charles_Reinke: ACILOQU 5G QUA.L +28 288
#note An "I give up" play; I don't see any realistic way to win this one after I block the last bingo line on row 5, barring a total meltdown on Chris' end.  A1 CALO at least keeps the Q and U together so I can maybe do something on row 5.
