#note had a really hard time with this turn finding an option that didn't give zach a lot back. I like how hard it is to bingo on this board right now. Maybe I should play TUMP G10. A sim uts this way on top but I dunno.

#note spent so long here... I'm holding the S for STALKIER hoping to blindside him with a big play later. this limits any play he has except an H play. let's hope he doesn't hit 50 there.

#note I felt like my best chance at winning this game was to score, score, and score, but I'm in a really bad position right now. I set up the JAPER hook. If he can't make a play there and then I do and I hold the S for STALKIER, I think I win.
