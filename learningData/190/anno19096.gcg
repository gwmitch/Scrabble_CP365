>Richard_Spence: AEQRSUW 8H SQUAW +42 42
#note Game 4 against my mother.
>Phyllis_Spence: BLNT J6 BL.NT +15 15
>Richard_Spence: EIINRTW H6 WI. +6 48
#note Quackle likes WI(T), but in either case IW is fished off. Knowing my mom, she doesn't really like fishing (even if it's the best play), so she is often surprised when I fish.
>Phyllis_Spence: ABM G5 BAM +22 37
>Richard_Spence: AEINNRT 10C INTRANE. +60 108
>Phyllis_Spence: ILNNOUV M2 SOILErS +80 117
>Phyllis_Spence: ILNNOUV --  -80 37
#note I ask her to designate the blank (which is required in tournaments), then immediately challenge the play, since I knew SOILERS* is no good (only LORISES/RISSOLE). She was certain SOILERS was good and thought that SQUAWS wasn't.
>Richard_Spence: ACFFILV E4 AFFLIC. +30 138
#note I'm going for tile turnover and blocking an easy bingo of LOuSIES(T) or anything through the N or T. I'm pretty sure she doesn't know LORISES or RISSOLE.
>Phyllis_Spence: ?EILOSS D4 LO +13 50
#note LIOnESS is the best common-word bingo. SEL 11E 42 is also decent.
>Richard_Spence: CEGINTV C8 EV.CTING +86 224
#note I didn't want to open the 3x3, considering she has a blank and two S's, but I've got no other choice.
>Phyllis_Spence: ?AEILSS 15A SI.nALES +122 172
>Phyllis_Spence: ?AEILSS --  -122 50
#note She lays down GLASSIEr, then takes it off, unsure whether it's good. Quackle prefers (C)ASE or LA(C)ES over bingos.

Also SIGNALES???
>Richard_Spence: EGHNORT 15A HO.G +33 257
#note Didn't know HOGGET. I thought AFFLICTOR was good (it isn't) - AFFLICTER is.
>Phyllis_Spence: ?AEILSS L8 .AILS +16 66
#note Common 7's include: SAILERS, SERIALS, AIMLESS, ALIASES, among other words, making SQUAWS.
>Richard_Spence: ENORRTT 12E TORRENT. +59 316
#note Well I lucked out.
>Phyllis_Spence: ??DEOSY B2 ODysSEY +77 143
#note geODESY M3 scores 105.
>Richard_Spence: ADEEOPS A7 OPED +47 363
#note OPED is good, Quackle likes PESADE for 57.
>Phyllis_Spence: EKU K4 KUE +18 161
#note Not sure if she saw SQUAWK.
>Richard_Spence: AEGRSUV M3 GRAVES +40 403
#note I immediately saw SEVRUGA, which would've been sweet. I decided to surprise her by hooking the S on SQUAW, which probably isn't the best play, but it doesn't matter at this point.
>Phyllis_Spence: UX 13I XU +36 197
>Richard_Spence: ADEOOPU A1 ODEA +26 429
>Phyllis_Spence: ITZ 13B Z.TI +15 212
#note ZIT/LAT scores 35.

>Phyllis_Spence:  (EHIN) +14 268
#note Somehow I scored ODEA 32 instead of 26, I have no idea why. Final score 536-268
