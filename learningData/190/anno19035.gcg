#note Exchange 5.

>Stefan_Fatsis: ?AADEHL I5 HEA.LAnD +64 64
#note bEH(E)ADAL scores 94, very tough to spot.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AFIIPSS J5 IF +31 45
#note I especially liked this, because an R draw gives me AIRS(HI)P
>Stefan_Fatsis: EMOW J10 MEOW +29 93
>Kevin_Bowerman: AIMPRSS 5E AIRS..P +48 93
#note My plan worked!
>Stefan_Fatsis: CDEOY 4A DECOY +31 124
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEJMSS A1 JEE. +36 129
#note Prefered this over AJEE to block the D and keep a vowel. Quackle agrees.
>Stefan_Fatsis: HIU C1 HUI. +18 142
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEFMOSS H1 FOAM. +39 168
#note Good thing he didn't open up an A, as I would have played SEAFOAMS*
>Stefan_Fatsis: EEGNV 3H .VENGE +28 170
>Kevin_Bowerman: ENOPSSZ 2F ZO. +32 200
#note Don't know why I prefered this over S(I)ZE, and I think I just missed ZONES.
>Stefan_Fatsis: AINT H12 ANTI +20 190
>Kevin_Bowerman: ENPSSTU N1 UPS +21 221
#note Did not know UNSTEPS. This isn't a good play anyways, as U(N)S(W)EPT is available.
>Stefan_Fatsis: BRX 1L BR.X +48 238
#note Deserved.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ENQSTTU 15F QU.NTETS +68 289
#note Not deserved.
>Stefan_Fatsis: AEY 2J YEA +35 273
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?CEEGOW M12 WOG. +16 305
#note Did not know COGWhEE(L). This sims 2nd to that.
>Stefan_Fatsis: ART 6D ART +15 288
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?CEEIOV N6 rEVOICE +68 373
#note Missed/didn't know EVECtIO(N). Wouldn't have played it anyways. Wasn't sure on dEVOICE, which sims best at C6, which is the most dangerous bingo lane, especially with no E's left.
>Stefan_Fatsis: IN 13J .IN. +7 295
>Kevin_Bowerman: BDGORRT O12 TROG +25 398
#note Wasn't sure on BORT, and losing a turn here would hurt a lot. Didn't do DORR, which sims second, because BGT is so antisynergic*
>Stefan_Fatsis: O 14M .O. +8 303
>Kevin_Bowerman: ABDLLRR 7B BRAD +18 416
#note Champ says this is best. I especially liked this, as it sets up (I)LL/LO/L(YARD) which could be very useful in the endgame, as I am not very likely to draw a vowel.
>Stefan_Fatsis: IIKNNST 8A KI +22 325
#note Best sequence is pretty awesome. Answer on next turn.
>Kevin_Bowerman: LLLR B7 ..RL +8 424
#note Best, keeping two outs. His awesome play last turn was (B)IN, forcing me to block with L(I), and then he can just go out with STINK. Tough sequence to see!
>Stefan_Fatsis: INNST 11B SNIT +15 340
#note INT(O) blocks my best out.
>Kevin_Bowerman: LL 3C .LL +14 438
#note One of my better played games this tourney, but certainly not without error.
>Kevin_Bowerman:  (N) +2 440
