>Joey_Krafchick: EILOU H4 LOUIE +12 12
#note At this point Joey is 14-0 and it's stupid and he needs to lose really badly. I'll do the honors, then. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EIIRTV 8A REInVIT. +80 80
#note A blank! A blank! I drew a blank!!!!! (and missed TIRRIVEE for 3 more)
>Joey_Krafchick: AEHLMRS 6G H.MERALS +67 79
#note After ROUTABLE, I'm not letting Joey phoney me again. HUMERAL means pertaining to the HUMERUS, no way that takes an S...

>Matt_Canik: AADENQY -  +0 80
#note ok I guess it does take an S. I point out to Joey that 67 and a free turn might actually be better than 102 points (ARMHOLES 2x2). 
>Joey_Krafchick: IIPX B4 PIXI. +30 109
>Matt_Canik: AADENQY 5J NAY +23 103
#note I was really proud of this play. I'm an Q away from QADI for a lot. 
>Joey_Krafchick: ETW 7J TEW +21 130
>Matt_Canik: ADDEHIQ C3 QADI +44 147
#note boom that's how it's done. A lesser player wouldn't have drawn the I this turn. But I am bingoboy. 
>Joey_Krafchick: DNTU I8 DUNT +18 148
>Matt_Canik: BDEEGHO 10E BEGO.E +13 160
#note I don't like to make excuses, but the playing room got EXTREMELY loud for about 5 minutes here despite me asking for quiet a few times. I blame the free open bar at the venue for inebriating a few players... I couldn't think and finally just had to play something for my clock's sake. Guh. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AENORRS 11A SERRANO +77 225
>Matt_Canik: DHINNST D1 THIN +37 197
#note Would anyone just play HIN here?
>Joey_Krafchick: GP B10 P.G +12 237
>Matt_Canik: ABDNORS 8L NARD +29 226
#note I couldn't convince myself that ANDRO was good (it is). Really want to hold the S for A4. 
>Joey_Krafchick: DFIS A1 FIDS +34 271
>Matt_Canik: BJKLOST I3 JO +19 245
#note I have no idea how I missed KOB/SPANK
>Joey_Krafchick: EF B1 EF +25 296
>Matt_Canik: ABKLSTW E4 KAB +29 274
#note Q really wants me to play (GO)WK for 17...
>Joey_Krafchick: CE N8 .EC +11 307
#note Interesting call
>Matt_Canik: LOSTVWY 3I .OWLY +36 310
#note Now I can just outrun though, I don't *need* to bingo
>Joey_Krafchick: AEM 2J MAE +28 335
>Matt_Canik: AEOOSTV 1K STOVE +37 347
#note Gotta burn the S here, I think
>Joey_Krafchick: ?CEGLNT 1A ..T.LiNG +33 368
#note Quackle seems useless in assessing this situation. Joey insists that this was a great play. I'm not sure. He needs to address (T)ROOZ up top for 42, but I will still have it underneath for 30 when/if he does. 

Q suggests (GO)NG holding CELT?, which will bingo a TON with this unseen pool. If I don't have TROOZ, I could play AZO off of GONG but I think Joey is in a good position after that. If I *do* have TROOZ, Joey has only a few possible draws:
AA (ACETALS et al), AI (LATICES et al),  AU (SULCATE), IO (CITOLES), IU (LUCITES et al), UU (nothing). So after GONG I think Joey is winning any time he doesn't pull UU. My last play doesn't imply anything about my leave, I think. 

This is a really cool position. 
>Matt_Canik: AAOORUZ 11I .ROOZ +30 377
#note I held FETTLING even though I was like 99% sure it was good, but then I saw that this won. Q says it doesn't actually win though, and only (P)A/A(R) does. Joey has a sequence that can win this game after TROOZ! Find it? 
>Joey_Krafchick: CEIU 5B ..E. +13 381
#note Joey runs out of time but sees this with a few seconds remaining and has to try it. If he plays (R)ICE or ECU/YE, he loses by 2. But his winning sequence? 
>Matt_Canik: AAU 12M AA +13 390
#note Joey first plays HI/LI 2E for 3. I hit AA for 13 and then Joey plays (i)CE/(HI)C for 24. If I try to block it with NU for 2, Joey simply plays ECU 4M and wins. 
>Joey_Krafchick: CIU N4 CI. +5 386
>Matt_Canik: U 10A U. +6 396
#note I did not play well this game. Glad *someone* beat joey though. 
>Matt_Canik:  (U) +2 398
