#note Weird situation, given that there are two blanks still in the bag.  I have to hope that Scott will bingo immediately and I can bingo back.
>Scott_Appel: DENNOTU 2I NU +10 335
#note Scott told me he passed up UNNOTED because the thought I would just bingo back with the two blanks that are theoretically on my rack.
>Charles_Reinke: BEIORSS 14G BOSSIER +67 398
#note I'm not smart enough to use the same strategy Scott just used, instead playing this and hoping that he doesn't have any bingo that plays.  D3 S(AD)I keeps me in the lead and BEORS will often bingo.  From Scott's last play, I can probably infer that at least one blank is in the bag, or he would have just played both of them and not worried about a bingo response from me; that makes BEORS even likelier to bingo.
