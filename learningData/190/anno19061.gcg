>Aldo_Cardia: GNOOZ 8D GONZO +34 34
>Charles_Reinke: DEIILNR F6 DI. +8 8
#note No idea at all.  I think I spent five minutes on this play.  My only focus was to retain IN for -ING bingos.  
>Aldo_Cardia: EGO E4 EGO +11 45
>Charles_Reinke: EIKLNOR D1 KILN +30 38
#note Probably KILO or KINO in the same spot.
>Aldo_Cardia: AEEILRS 9H REALISE +61 106
>Charles_Reinke: ABEHORT O8 BROTH +50 88
#note I was so focused on the REALISER hook that I ignored all my 8L plays.  BAHT might be better.
>Aldo_Cardia: AA C3 AA +11 117
>Charles_Reinke: AEFFIIN 1D .NIFE +36 124
>Aldo_Cardia: U 12N U. +5 122
>Charles_Reinke: AFIJOPR B2 RAJ +34 158
#note K4 FRIJO(L) is way better, but I missed it.  I'm not going to stop Aldo's imminent bingo, but I can minimize the damage by blocking column K.  (underscored by 1)
>Aldo_Cardia: O D8 .O +3 125
>Charles_Reinke: BEFIIOP A1 FOB +32 190
#note (underscored by 1...again!)
>Aldo_Cardia: ?AEIRST K5 STAR.IkE +78 203
#note Aldo told me after the game that he drew the blank on his AEIRST fish. (overscored by 4)
>Charles_Reinke: EIIILPW J2 WIPE +19 209
#note IW is such an ugly leave that I couldn't bring myself to play J2 PILEI.
>Aldo_Cardia: DOT I1 DOT +27 230

>Aldo_Cardia: AX 15G AX +56 317
>Charles_Reinke: CEIMSUV 12H CUV.E +26 345
#note This is the turn where I have to decide whether I want to go for a bingo of my own or try to stop Aldo from bingoing.  13L VUM achieves the former; this play achieves the latter.
>Aldo_Cardia: EHTV E11 VET.H +26 343
>Charles_Reinke: AIMSTUW L1 WAMUS +31 376
#note Blocking the M column is now mandatory.  Luckily, this play scores a lot while doing it.
>Aldo_Cardia: ADY 1L .ADY +33 376
>Charles_Reinke: EGINPRT 12A PE.T.R +22 398
#note Two plays win outright: 15J ENGIRT (which I could theoretically derive from ENGIRD, but not while under severe time pressure) and the more reasonable M1 (A)GIN (blocking Aldo's outs on column N and leaving me with 12A PE(T)T(E)R ).  I saw that I could win if I played PETTER first (setting up A12 (P)ING) and Aldo went for the points with O8 (BROTH)ERs.  However, I was not clever enough to block with plays on column M, and instead looked only on the N column.
>Aldo_Cardia: ?AENRU O8 .....iER +36 412
#note Phony (only BROTHY), but I obviously wasn't touching it.
>Charles_Reinke: GIN A12 .ING +21 419
>Charles_Reinke:  (ANU) +6 425
#note Final score: 423-416.
