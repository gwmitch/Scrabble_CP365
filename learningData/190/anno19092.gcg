>Puneet_Sharma: AAILORU -OUA +0 0
#note Completely missed RAOULIA and didn't want to play OURALI. So exchanged OUA, keeping RAIL. Horrible play.
>Winter: DEOTV 8D VOTED +26 26
>Puneet_Sharma: AEILORU D7 A.OURE +18 18
#note Best play is OURALI @ 7E. Mine was third best but costed me badly.
>Winter: HIKST C3 SHTIK +45 71
>Winter: EIOOSTW (challenge) +5 76
>Puneet_Sharma: AAHILNZ D3 HA +25 43
#note Another horibble choice; I saw HAZAN @ B6. But chose to keep the Z and play HA. Maybe i overvalue power tiles?
>Winter: EIOOSTW H5 WOO.IEST +63 139
>Puneet_Sharma: ACILNRZ G7 Z.L +47 90
#note Keeping the Z payed off; but still suboptimal over two turns.
>Winter: ?AELRTY 2D ALERTlY +75 214
#note Lucky for me he missed TRAWLEYS!
>Puneet_Sharma: ACEIMNR B6 MANIC +38 128
#note I was disheartened to see my spot for CARMINE taken @ 2D. So much so that I didn't even think of the M hook on AHA even though i know the word! All optimal plays are uptop, while I went with what i thought was a pretty good play. Sigh.

>Winter: BIO 1F BOI +27 269
>Puneet_Sharma: AADIMNR L4 MARINAD. +74 277
#note Gained momentum with back to back Bingos
>Winter: EFGIOS 1J FOGIES +44 313
>Puneet_Sharma: AADEGNT A5 GATED +43 320
#note Thought about AGNATED; convinced myself that AGNATE doesn't take the D; but didn't even think of just playing AGNATE. These are the kind of brainfarts* i need to avoid; oh and plus also know more words.
>Winter: CDEELNX J10 W.ILD +21 334
>Winter: CDEELNX --  -21 313
#note Not sure if this was a genuine mistake or Winter just trying to sneak this by me; he was playing really quickly and I was mostly catching up with tracking and it would have probably worked too; luckily I saw the play just in time.
>Puneet_Sharma: AGJNQRU K5 JAG +45 365
#note best
>Winter: CIL J10 C.IL +12 325
>Puneet_Sharma: ABFNQRU M3 BARF +38 403
#note This is where things turned south for me; I played BARF which is the best play hoping I could draw one of the few vowels left.
>Winter: DEIW M9 WI.ED +38 363
>Puneet_Sharma: LNNPQUU F11 .UL +5 408
#note Terrible draw; anyways, I was pretty sure he had the blank and the X. Things looked bleak given I had no playce to play the Q. Hence i played PUL to open the PULP, PULU, PULI, PULE hooks in case i draw an I or E or O for QUOP. 

Really bad choice; I had one U, i should just have played PUN @ E4
>Winter: ?EINOVX 14G NEVI +18 381
#note Winter saw the PULP hook and played to block it.
>Puneet_Sharma: NNOPQUU 15F PUN +23 431
#note Was running out of time and just played pun. I should have probably played UPON; can't play SUQ cuz he gets a big play at 15H. 
>Winter: ?OX 3M .O +4 385
#note Winter trying to get me over time...didn't work but he won the game.
>Puneet_Sharma: NOQU N8 UN +8 439
#note Well; lost a winnable game. I did get a bit unlucky with some of the tiles at the end, but all in all a pretty good.
