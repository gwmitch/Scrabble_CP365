#note In the category of "plays Charles has very little chance of seeing": EPIT(HE)TIC.  H1 PETITI(ON) is not unreasonable, however.

#note Paranoid about this spot with two blanks unseen.  (Self-reassuring "Quackle agrees" comment here)

#note Aaah!
>Charles_Reinke: AADEOSY 3C AYES +20 366
#note Blocking the last bingo lane and hoping to outrun Chris with my 40-point lead.  Quackle is eviscerating me for this and wants me to do O7 DAY.
>Chris_Tallman: ABRV H1 BRAV. +42 368
#note Well, that didn't work.
>Charles_Reinke: ADIOORT N2 DROI. +14 380
#note Continuing my "no bingos for anybody, ever" strategy.  Chris has to have a blank by this point.
>Chris_Tallman: AY O8 AY +28 396
>Charles_Reinke: AEMORTX I2 EX +36 416
#note Blocking bingos through the B, of which there are many (assuming Chris now holds both blanks).  My 20-point lead is unlikely to hold up, though, with the scoring spot at 4A.  We have the score at 416-395, but Quackle thinks Chris has 396.
>Chris_Tallman: ?BEEELR J2 BEj...L +38 434
#note Awesome play by Chris that would win if the score was correct.  This must be why Quackle didn't like my play of EX last turn.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AIMORT 12A ...IATOM +37 453
#note From my perspective, this play ties the game.
>Chris_Tallman: EER 4B REE +18 452
>Chris_Tallman:  (?R) +2 454
#note Final score: 453-453.  We agreed not to recount.  Both of us finished even at 15.5-15.5.  Overall, I am disappointed with the quality of my play in the tournament and am glad that I didn't finish worse than I did.
