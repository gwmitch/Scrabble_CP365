#note I was pretty confident on AFF not taking an S, but, already being down by 100, I wanted to get back in this thing.  H10 (T)EMPEH is the right play and I have no excuse for missing it.  This is the first of multiple short-word-knowledge errors in the tournament.

#note There was a reason I passed up K4 PUCE, but that reason has been swept away by the merciless winds of time.  Perhaps I wanted to set up the (A)GAPE hook (despite not possessing it myself).

#note It's hard to evaluate plays when you have no shot at winning.  I would probably do 14J WIENI(E) if given another chance, but at the time, I wasn't thinking about anything other than fishing.

#note I thought EINRS would go well with the open O and A.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: LNY 4D L.NY +14 414
#note Great play by Gabriel that prevents me from reopening the top left corner of the board.

#note This is actually a good play, but if we're being honest, I just wanted to play a word that doesn't get played very often in RIBES.
