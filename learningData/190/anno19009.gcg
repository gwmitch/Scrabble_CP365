>matt_o_connor: CEHW H5 WECH +24 24
#note yes WECH. YES I LET SOMEONE PLAY WECH ON ME IN DIVISION 1 OF NATIONALS AFTER PREPARING FOR A WHOLE YEAR AND PLANNING MY PATH TO VICTORY. i like stared at it so quizzically and didn't even say HOLD instead thought WHY WOULD HE JUST NOT PLAY CHEW??? then suddenly it was my turn again. for the rest of the game i was 100% sure WECH was a phony. 
>cesar: CINOOTU 9F UNTO +19 19
#note -2 OUT is better but i was too WECHed out to notice.
>matt_o_connor: EIV 5E VIE. +20 44
>cesar: CEIKOOZ F8 O.ZO +33 52
>matt_o_connor: AHS 12D AHS +26 70
#note keep in mind at this point i have like 12 minutes on my clock and matt has 27
>cesar: ACEEGIK 13B CAGE +22 74
>matt_o_connor: AINV B10 VIN.A +36 106
#note this literally took 0.5 seconds to come down. i don't think his clock changed.
>cesar: AEIKRTT 11E T.KE +28 102
#note at this point i'm already negative on time and wondering what my life has become. At what point did I make a wrong choice that led to accepting WECH on a div 1 board at nationals? this self-contemplation led me to miss the much superior A14 KI. (-5.5)

>cesar: AEFILMR N10 FE.. +30 246
#note (-6) N9 IF -- far better leave and a more open board. all this stuff would be more obvious if I didn't have like 3 minutes on my clock
>matt_o_connor: DDPU G2 DUP.D +13 257
>cesar: AGILMRY 11J MAG +28 274
#note missing AGOG... christ what a disaster. (-23) ... i also missed it while quackling, so i think AGO only takes an N is ingrained in my head.
>matt_o_connor: ?EEOOPR 14G OPEROsE +69 326
#note but he probably would have eventually seen it at 2I if i'd played GRIMLY down there or something. he did have THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MINUTES ON HIS CLOCK.
>cesar: AIILRSY 15G YAR +37 311
#note i wrote down RIYAL and then thought i was making it up. (-13)

>matt_o_connor: ELORU 2B LOURE. +18 412
>cesar: AIIMNRS K2 ANIMI +21 347
#note i just kinda gave up. i guess i could play LI and go for seminar/moraines -- i remember considering it and i don't know why i decided against it.
>matt_o_connor: EILNSTX 3A SIX +40 452
>cesar: NRS 6J R.NS +6 353
