#note Maybe too brazen.  Or maybe that's hindsight talking.

#note I am walking the path of bingoing to its endpoint.  I will not abandon my journey with 8L (Z)INS.

#note O7 R(E)RISINg.  It's like I don't even want to win this game!  (Although, 58 points doesn't really get me back in it)

#note I don't think I'm going to win this one if I try to outscore Kristiina on a closed board; thirty points is too big a deficit.  The abundance of E's and A's in the pool made the vowelless GRS leave a little more palatable.

#note Quackle wants me to pass up the bingo, but considers my situation dire no matter what I play.  I suppose I can angle to bingo out by playing something like 14M AG this turn, as EERST bingos with most two-tile combinations left in the pool and Kristiina would have to make a one-tile play to avoid emptying the bag.  But AG leaves me down by 76, and all Kristiina would have to do is make a twenty-point play to make the lead out of reach for any bingo I can play.  Anyway, REAGENTS only wins if Kristiina has something horrible like AAAEEIO.
