>Kevin_Bowerman: ?ADGGTY -GGY +0 0
#note Did not know GADGeTY, I thought of the word, but then thought there was no chance that it was a word. I can't really blame myself on that won. I didn't play YAG/GAY because I didn't want to keep DGT? for only 14, but didn't really consider GAG, which above this. Not off to a great start here.
>Connie_Creed: III -III +0 0
#note Exchange 3
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?ADELOT 8F LEOTArD +68 68
#note LOAThED for 68 sims best. Not a huge difference here, but after a 3 tile exchange I would be better off giving her an H than an R
>Connie_Creed: AEOZ F5 AZO.E +34 34
>Kevin_Bowerman: EGINRTU 5E G.UNTER +32 100
#note I have no words for how I missed UT(T)ERING. Absolutely terrible.
>Connie_Creed: AEGV H1 VEGA. +30 64
>Kevin_Bowerman: DEIRSTX 6H SIX +63 163
#note Sim prefers D(E)X to fish. I certainly thought about it, but this is fine.
>Connie_Creed: DNOW 4J DOWN +29 93
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADEERRT K8 .ETARDER +66 229
#note I wasn't sure on RETREAD because I am bad. Also, this word could possibly draw a challenge, as it is acutally fairly low prob (10250)
>Connie_Creed: ABENN 15F BANNE. +24 117
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEHTUY J13 EY. +30 259
#note I liked this more than THUYA, no clue why that is simming best. Shouldn't I block bingo lanes, not open up more lanes/easy points?
>Connie_Creed: JO 2F JO. +26 143
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEFHTTU G7 F.H +35 294
#note Somehow missing H(E)FT. They sim almost even, as this is a bit more defensive.
>Connie_Creed: DERR 13I R..DER +18 161
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEGTTU 14B TEGUA +22 316
#note Best play here is soooo sick! Answer on next turn.
>Connie_Creed: ORU 3L OUR +15 176
#note (BANNER)ETTE last turn scores 39!
>Kevin_Bowerman: EHLOTVY 2M HOY +28 344
#note Very weak play, VOLTE is better in every way. I think I was scared of here scoring here, even though I can just score there myself this turn!
>Connie_Creed: AIQSU 10B QUAIS +53 229
>Kevin_Bowerman: CEILTTV D8 CL.VI +26 370
#note Sims best, but VITTLE is another good option, as her last play suggests that she does not have the blank, and it digs a little more for it. LIV(R)E also sims well, but I did not think that (REDDER)S was a word.
>Connie_Creed: ?BELOSW N7 WObBLE.S +86 315
#note A lot of better bingos with (REDDER)S, so I would assume she didn't think it was a word either.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACEINTT O6 TENIA +31 401
#note Sims best, even with the ugly pool. I remember really wanting to drop the I here, which is a priority with 5/16 unseen tiles being I's
>Connie_Creed: MOP 15A POM +27 342
>Kevin_Bowerman: CIIIKMT O1 M. +21 422
#note Hi I's! (R)IM(E) is a large upgrade on this, as it scores more, and unloads an I.
>Connie_Creed: AFILNPS 8A SPI. +24 366
#note 1J NAPS is best, tough play to see.
>Kevin_Bowerman: CIIIIKT B6 KI. +19 441
#note Best.
>Connie_Creed: AFLN M6 FA +13 379
#note I think this was her play. (A)NAL is best
>Kevin_Bowerman: CIIIT 11A TI +13 454
#note Whoops, T(I)C is 2 points better, as it blocks her only out.
>Connie_Creed: LN 12C L.N +3 382
#note Best. I played fairly well for my standards this game, but G(A)UNTER and HOY were huge inaccuracies.
>Connie_Creed:  (CII) +10 392
