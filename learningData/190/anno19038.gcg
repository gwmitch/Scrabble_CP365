#note I also considered P(O)BOY to set up (L)OX, but that's normally going to be blocked. Plus, this play works very very well with my remaining tiles with (BOX)Y, (OX)O/Y, (JO)Y. Maybe I should play POX, keeping 10D BOY for next turn? This sims best.

>Kevin_Bowerman: DENNNNT 3I ..NNED +22 178
>Kevin_Bowerman: DENNNNT --  -22 156
#note I didn't think this was a word, but put it down because I was mad at how quickly things had turned badly for me. Stupid.
>Doug_Lundquist: CLMO L10 C.MOL +24 278
>Kevin_Bowerman: DENNNNT -NNN +0 156
#note Should have done this last turn.
>Doug_Lundquist: AEFGILR 15A FILAGRE. +89 367
#note I challenged out of frustration. I really can't win with this on the board.
>Kevin_Bowerman: DEINORT -  +0 156
>Doug_Lundquist: AENOV K3 NOVAE +23 390
>Kevin_Bowerman: DEINORT L1 DIER +26 182
#note This isn't a word, and even if it was, it wouldn't be a good play. I need to stop letting the game get to my head.
>Doug_Lundquist: AETZ 12A ZETA +54 444
>Kevin_Bowerman: BELNNOT M12 ENOL +18 200
#note I needed a lane. Doesn't sim too badly. I'm at 0% to win no matter what I do according to quackle.

>Doug_Lundquist: AW 4D WA. +21 476
>Kevin_Bowerman: NRRSTTU M3 STRUT +33 261
#note Cool, STURT is a word. Sim wants me to fish with RU(N)T(S), which actually could work, with a couple lanes open.
>Doug_Lundquist: GNU 1L .UNG +18 494
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEIINRT N6 NITER +15 276
#note RE(N)T(S), TEN(N)I(S) and N6 TIE are all one point better than this. Scored as 14.
>Doug_Lundquist: EGIW J7 WIG +12 506
#note Best.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AI 14B AI +12 288
#note Best. This game slipped away quickly. Not sure if there was all that much I could have done, but that in no way means that I played well this game.
