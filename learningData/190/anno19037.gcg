>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AEILPT 8D PAnTILE +72 72
#note I wish I had play PLIcATE here, but at the time I did not know that its only hook was a D
>Gary_Skowronski: ILOOV 7B OVOLI +19 19
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEFINTT B1 FETATI.N +76 148
#note Good thing that he gave me an O, as I did not know ANTI(L)EFT
>Gary_Skowronski: ?DEGINR 1B .INGeRED +89 108
#note Lots of high scoring bingos available here, but none score more than 3 more than this.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADEIINT A8 INEDITA +83 231
#note I am such a luckbox. I somehow missed the K5 placement, which scores 9 more.
>Gary_Skowronski: DHRY 4A H.RDY +32 140
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEHORSU 6F HOUR +28 259
#note Almost draw a 4th bingo here! I wanted to block this Z spot, but maybe HAO or HUE is a better way to do that.
>Gary_Skowronski: UUUW -UUUW +0 140
#note Exchange 4
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACEEISS J4 SAIC. +19 278
#note I thought I was being sooo defensive and clever here. All of quackles favorite plays open up a bunch of lines for 8s. Maybe 5E ES here.
>Gary_Skowronski: AX B13 AX +38 178
>Kevin_Bowerman: EEJNORS C13 JEE +50 328
>Gary_Skowronski: AEN 12C ANE +17 195
>Kevin_Bowerman: AENORSW 11D OW +22 350
#note I spent a long time here. I wanted to block the 2x2 lane he just set up, but I also wanted to go for the points/leave with 5E OW. I think this looks fine, and after simming for 1000 iterations, it is second, only to tacking the N on the end of this. That makes it a lot harder for him to bingo, and it will likely score less.
>Gary_Skowronski: EEL 10D EEL +14 209
>Kevin_Bowerman: AENORSY 2I OY +16 366
#note I wanted to block the row 2 lane, but I should probably just play RAYONS, which was one of my other thoughts. I'm not sure whether on not I saw 5D EASY, which also looks like an improvement on my play, even with only 2 unseen E's.
>Gary_Skowronski: AMW 3G MAW +26 235
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADENRSU 9I ASUNDER +72 438
#note I completely missed DANSEUR here, that's terrible. I almost passed this up, as all of the bingos I saw (ASUNDER and (L)AUNDERS/(L)URDANES) all give back possible 3x3s, but that could easily be solved by DANSEUR.
>Gary_Skowronski: BIS O8 B.IS +18 253
>Kevin_Bowerman: BGGKOUV 11K VUGG. +20 458
#note Finally, a bad draw! This is best by a longshot
>Gary_Skowronski: EL M11 .EL +8 261
>Kevin_Bowerman: ABKMOPZ K3 KOB +28 486
#note I liked this, as it sets up ZAP for next turn, with only one other hook for (K)? left, which is a great plan for if he bingos next turn. Champ only likes (U)M betterr than this, but that can't be right. It does still keep this sequence of 2 plays open though, so I'd guess that there's a possibility of me drawing into another big play somewhere.
>Gary_Skowronski: EINORST 13E STONIER +66 327
>Kevin_Bowerman: AMOPRTZ L2 ZAP +44 530
#note Oooh, R(E)P sets MATZO/(REP)O to go out, but Z(E)P is even better. I admittedly did not give this endgame much thought, and I don't think I had much time left. (-23)
>Gary_Skowronski: CFQU I12 Q. +11 338
#note The other Q(I) placement is better, as he would be threatening CU(I)F to go out.
>Kevin_Bowerman: MORT 3K ..RT +16 546
#note Best, held and released.
>Gary_Skowronski: CFU N1 CU. +10 348
>Kevin_Bowerman: MO 2F MO +24 570
#note Definitely my luckiest game of the tournament. I think I played alright here, but it could definitely have been improved by a lot of plays.
>Kevin_Bowerman:  (F) +8 578
