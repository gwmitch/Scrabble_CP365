>Siddharth_Murali: AAIIJSX F8 .IX +29 29
>David_Gibson: KOOT E9 TOOK +27 45
#note I think David's awesome for thinking about things and not jumping on the KOTO plays. 
>Siddharth_Murali: AAAEIJS 12C JA.E +30 59
>David_Gibson: DOW 13B DOW +37 82
>Siddharth_Murali: AADIIIS -AII +0 59
#note I remember deciding against OIDIA, since he could just score at the bottom left and the board would be shut. However, now (6/13/15) I don't agree with my old logic- I'm down only 23 before the turn, so it's better to score while cutting his score. 
>David_Gibson: ENOPRT 14A NOTER +32 114
#note I spotted a P when he was drawing.

>David_Gibson: IPTZ 15H .PITZ +26 156
>Siddharth_Murali: EFGLNRS 10H .RF +14 150
#note I like being proactive against David here, going for a bingo with only one S in the bag.
>David_Gibson: AERY 11H .EARY +23 179
>Siddharth_Murali: EEGILNS G8 .E +9 159
#note I played this to be very proactive again, but I now think GEE for 27 is very slightly better.
>David_Gibson: B 10D B.. +12 191
#note B(OX) came down almost immediately.
>Siddharth_Murali: EGILNSV L8 VIN.L +30 189

>Siddharth_Murali: DEGMOSV 9K V.G +9 198
#note VIG? 13H SMOG? SMOGS? I feel like I should ditch the 'forcing David to do something' strategy and score before I get too behind. Plus, I should have known that he's grooming his rack too.
>David_Gibson: ?ACEHNP N6 CHeAPEN +83 296
#note I'
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEMOST O10 EMOTED +41 239
#note CHEAPENED should be better.
>David_Gibson: WY 7M W.Y +16 312
>Siddharth_Murali: EOOQRSU 6L RO. +10 249
#note CHEAPENER is way better.
>David_Gibson: ACELT 5I CLEAT +22 334
#note This play would actually help me immensely later on.
>Siddharth_Murali: EEOQSSU L1 QUES.. +50 299

#note (No comment). But ha, this was a while ago!
>David_Gibson: AG J5 .AG +6 340
>Siddharth_Murali: EEOQSSU 4L OSE +19 268
#note This is what I should have played last turn.
>David_Gibson: HU 3K UH +12 352
>Siddharth_Murali: AEINQSU G5 QUI.. +15 283
#note I passed up QUASI for 50 to play this, which I think is correct. But QUARE has to be better, despite 3 I's in the pool, to prevent INQUIRE/ENQUIRE partial blocks. CLEAT really helped me this turn!
>David_Gibson: DI 6F D.I +8 360
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEEINS N14 AE +11 294
#note I don't think I can win here. QUARE would have helped.
