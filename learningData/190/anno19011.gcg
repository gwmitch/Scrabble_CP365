>Siddharth_Murali: CGMOORT 8G MOG +12 12
#note (Anno reedit- 6/13/2015) This is now the most recent game in my annotated games, so I'll say this here. I decided to remove 'clutter' from my games (I actually wanted to remove all of them, but left a few of them alone). I may post games in the future, but they will be restricted (e.g. perhaps only Nationals games, etc.)
>David_Gibson: DEZ 7F ZED +22 22
#note Had I opened with COG, David's options would have been much more limited. At the time, I spaced on the defensive merits of COG, and went with the equity. After the game, David said he preferred COG by a million.
>Siddharth_Murali: ACORRTV 6H ARVO +19 31
#note David said after the game that there was a strong chance that he would have played ROC in this position, for 14. I didn't agree with him then, and I don't now. But I asked him about my first few plays, and I highly value his opinion.
>David_Gibson: DEIORSW K5 W.ODSIER +98 120
>Siddharth_Murali: ACLMQTT 10J Q. +31 62
>David_Gibson: GI 11I GI. +15 135
>Siddharth_Murali: ACLMRTT 7C CRA... +21 83
#note David said after the game that he would have also played CRAZED here. Now (6/13/15) I believe that -MLT is better, despite needing to draw an E (and probably an S) to bingo on this board.
>David_Gibson: JOT E4 JOT. +22 157
>Siddharth_Murali: DEHLMTT L11 DELT +20 103
#note I think TH(O)LED is far better, despite knowing that I'm playing David- DELT opens the board in the wrong way, a way that he can score 40 and shut it back down.
>David_Gibson: AEK 15J KEA +15 172
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEHMNT 8K .EATH +30 133
#note At the time, I thought this was much better than HAJ. I'm not sure if I agree with my old logic. Despite opening the board when down, DEATH lets him bingo 27% as opposed to 14% after HAJ, but I bingo only 23% as opposed to 33% after HAJ. Given that he played KEA, those numbers only get inflated, making this play worse. Opening the board when down is still bad if it's much more beneficial to him than me.
>David_Gibson: ?AANNOS O8 .OsANNAS +83 255
>Siddharth_Murali: ABEMNPT M7 B.P +13 146
#note I think BEAM for 32 is better, despite the significantly worse leave (Quackle has B(A)P ahead). I need to score such that my eventual bingo can actually pull me within a reasonable margin.
>David_Gibson: ?EFILRS 4B FRI.oLES +86 341
#note David started muttering, so I hoped he had a bad rack. Then, 2 minutes later, he says that he's really sorry, and he throws his tiles right out on the board forming tRIFLES/EME for 72. Then he said 'there, I just drew this' Then, he took them back, and after another minute, he changed it to FRIJoLES.  After the game, he said that he was angry for not playing tRIFLES for 14 fewer, and he called himself greedy and stupid for playing like Quackle, saying he would play tRIFLES on a do-over. 
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEMNTU 3I UNMATED +75 221
#note David held this for about a minute, then accepted.
>David_Gibson: EHY 2L YEH +35 376
>Siddharth_Murali: AIORSUX M12 XI +32 253
#note Totally missed RAX for 48 here, but I think this is better.
>David_Gibson: EEPV 1I VEEP +23 399
#note Here he decided he'll stop playing like Quackle, clearly passing up VEEP at the top left for 31.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABIORSU C7 .ARIBOUS +76 329
>David_Gibson: ILTU 11C .UILT +14 413
>Siddharth_Murali: FINNOOT 10B F.NO +19 348
#note I remember spending 8 minutes on this turn, but this is about as good as it gets here.
>David_Gibson: LY E10 ..LY +7 420
>Siddharth_Murali: CEINNOT F3 N. +1 349
#note This was the dumbest play ever... :( 
>David_Gibson: AEGIRUW B2 WA.ER +26 446
>Siddharth_Murali: CEIINOT C1 COI. +21 370
#note We both miserably failed on this endgame. His WAGER was 21 off, and this was 25 off, or something like that.
>David_Gibson: GIU N6 GI. +12 458
>Siddharth_Murali: EINT B13 NIT +12 382
