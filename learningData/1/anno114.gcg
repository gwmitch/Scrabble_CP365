#note Apparently, this innocuous-looking move pitched the game away. A very interesting and instructive position. RARITY (O4) sims best, along with ARIARY (O3) and CAY (8M). It feels strange to hold on to the Q, but I guess it will always be playable, and possibly for a big score. QAT seemed like a good play, but it left the board basically dead to column O, and being behind with only one place to play is not good. Still, it's surprising to me that the play sims so poorly. Quite difficult.

#note A desperation move - probably the best shot though.
