#note HUMID or VAIR look good
>Will: DORTUWY 6J WOR.Y +27 255
#note O12 DUTY is far superior to WORRY positionally. I earned this loss by opening the top area of the board for Matthew with WORRY instead of forcing him to do it himself and responding. I don't think I actually ever considered DUTY, but that has to be a lapse in focus, it's not like it's a hard play to spot.

#note What else? 3G GET? It didn't seem sufficiently defensive with the new line (SEG/SAG still available). 3E BEGET? There are heavy plays left that would crush me from 2B after that. I am in some danger of being outscored here with the wrong draws. BOG seems to be the best I can do.

>Will: EEEELRT F5 LEE. +15 363
#note What the heck do I do now? CP picks LEEK, but it doesn't stand out as a particularly great play. EEK is out because of any of the MPW hooks scoring too much in response. CLEEK could be bad, but I'll have to live with it.
>Matthew: ?ACDNOW E4 WAND +29 363
#note COWHAND finishes me off immediately
>Will: EEEIJRT 2D JETE +18 381
#note I am down to very minimal time. I played JETE to block COMPONe (a 3/8 chance), but I failed to consider the possibility that Matthew may never have seen that word before in his life, and I should just try to make a play that wins some of the other endgames. Actually, if Matthew has COMPON?, he doesn't need to even play COMPONe to win the game. After JETE, I only win if the M or the blank are in the bag - with the M I have ERMI(NE) 6A as an out, and Matthew can't block it while scoring enough. After JEW, on the other hand, which was the other play I considered with my time dwindling away, I win with CMN? - in each case I threaten big plays along row 2 (TIERCE/RETIME/RETINE), and Matthew can't both block them and score enough. A painful game, completely blown - just not enough time on this pivotal move after tanking so frequently on the other non-bingo turns.
