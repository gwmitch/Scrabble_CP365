>Charles_Reinke: AIKOSTU 11J KOI +25 109
#note I feel like this play commits me to bingoing.  I didn't see 3H OUTASK, which catches me up the old-fashioned way.  I didn't know LIKUTA; had I known that word, that would have been my play.
>Scott_Appel: DELOO L7 DOOL.E +16 140
>Charles_Reinke: AERSTUY 3I YURTA +37 146
#note As I entered this rack into Quackle, I immediately saw ESTUARY.  It plays at F7.
>Scott_Appel: AEGINO E5 .EGONIA +20 160
>Charles_Reinke: ADEQSTZ F2 QAD. +34 180
>Scott_Appel: ABO D7 ABO +20 180
#note Good play by Scott to set up some bingo lanes.
>Charles_Reinke: EFIMSTX G1 FIX +49 229
#note 6H NIXE for 60 was hard to pass up; looking back, I should have done that.  There are plenty of E's in the bag; no need to get attached to mine.

>Charles_Reinke: AEFINRS F10 FA +28 308
#note Should have played a five-letter play in the same spot.  I didn't realize how much more they scored.  There is no point fishing on this board.
>Scott_Appel: GJ 12B J.G +22 325
>Charles_Reinke: EEGINRS 15C .EEING +32 340
#note Quackle wants me to fish with 4B EM, but on this turn I commit to simply trying to outscore him.
>Scott_Appel: ACDE D1 CADE +33 358
>Charles_Reinke: CERRSTZ 13J ZEST +34 374
#note I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of ZESTY when I played this.  CREST is probably better, leaving the possibility of 8L ORZO and not giving back so many potential bingos.
>Scott_Appel: ?NORTUY N7 cOUNTRY +78 436
#note Underscored by one.  Given what Scott has, I was going to lose even if I play CREST.  That thought made me feel better for a while, then I felt worse again because I realized that I'm a dirty rationalizing rationalizer.  
>Scott_Appel:  (ACRRUV) +22 458
#note Final score recorded as 457-374.
