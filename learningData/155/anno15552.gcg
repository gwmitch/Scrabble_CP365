>Peter_A: ??ADEOT H6 cOAsTED +66 66
#note Before this game, I had to confirm with the director that this was correct: same board, same opponent, same 1st/2nd as the previous round.
>Carl: AAEHLOR I9 HALO +26 26
#note HAO G7 scores comparably while keeping a better leave, and without giving as much back. It's also positionally superior, as Peter will not be able to take out both column F lanes easily.  I couldn't discern between MOTIF and OF against Lou, but it's obvious here that HAO is better than HALO in every respect. (-8.5)
>Peter_A: KPS 11G K..PS +22 88
>Carl: AEGINRU G9 AU. +17 43
>Peter_A: INSZ F6 ZINS +39 127
>Carl: CEGINNR I7 EN....ING +20 63
#note Quackle fishes with HALON I9, which hits column K or row 14 with 41 of the remaining tiles. I would imagine that Peter will do his best to block both lanes, but I still might hit, say COERCING 6H. All in all, I'm surprised to see my play sim so badly. (-19?)
>Peter_A: CHU 15F CHU. +30 157
>Carl: CEFIORV 14I .OVICE +26 89
#note Quackle fishes with FOH G13 on the thesis that Peter's going to leave the last bingo lane open at this score. (-2?)
>Peter_A: EOSW O12 OWSE +36 193
>Carl: BDFINOR K5 FORBID. +26 115
#note My play is best in terms of equity, but the best play is clearly INBORN 8A, opening some desperately needed bingo lanes. I just missed it.
>Peter_A: AOUY 8K .AYOU +33 226
>Carl: DEFLNTT L12 FL.T +16 131
#note M3 DEFTLY wins the sim. You could argue against it because it's easy to parallel and gunk up that side of the board, but it's already quite gunkable already with a play along Row 6. (-6?)

#note Nice block.

>Peter_A: AEEIRST -  +0 326
>Carl: BEEMMPW D1 .EM +6 275
#note Peter's perspective: Carl won't block LEARIEST because why would I challenge RAGG if I had a bingo to the L? Carl's perspective: I must have blocked RARITIES so he's going to play out with LISTERIA.
