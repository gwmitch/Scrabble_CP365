>Charles_Reinke: EFNORST H4 FRONTES +78 78
#note 2013 Nationals, round 31.  If I win this game, I cash.  Even if I don't win, I'm very happy to have done so well after several years of mediocre showings.
>Rafi_Stern: AEIMOPR G9 MEROPIA +76 76
>Charles_Reinke: DELPSUY 15D UPL.Y +33 111
#note Not a real word.  But I wanted the three extra points over LAYUP.   Every game should be annotated in order to discourage me from pulling these stunts.
>Rafi_Stern: AORZ 11C RAZO. +28 104
#note Rafi is setting up his J here.  He also could have played JAR to set up his Z.  Mind = irrevocably blown.
>Charles_Reinke: CDEGSSU 4H .UDGE +20 131
#note Not eager to play FUDGES and give away rack information.  But I could have done C9 CURDS without arousing too much suspicion.
>Rafi_Stern: JT 10F J..T +52 156
>Charles_Reinke: CEENSST L3 C.NTESES +61 192
#note "I'm going to cash, I'm going to cash, I'm going to cash in friggin Div. 1 of Nationals..."
>Rafi_Stern: AILNV M9 NIVAL +23 179
>Charles_Reinke: AGHIIIO 12D HA +31 223
#note If I draw a letter that goes in front of -IG, I can score 30 points again next turn.

>Charles_Reinke: ?DIIIOT 13G .OI +6 262
#note Missed M4 DOIT.  Put down 15J TORII and took it back because I was afraid of Q/X comebacks at 14N.  My one goal was to keep the D for 9N.
>Rafi_Stern: DIKN 15K D.INK +30 256
>Charles_Reinke: ?ADIIMT M5 AIM +19 281
#note Positive: DIT? works very well with the E's left in the bag.  Negative: I just blocked my D hook.

>Charles_Reinke: ?DILORT E1 TROLlI.D +66 347
#note I spent a very long time looking for a bingo that didn't slot a letter in the triple-triple line...
>Rafi_Stern: AEFGORS 1A FAGO.ERS +167 490
#note After this play, I put my chances of cashing at approximately 0.01%.  The .01 being the alternate universe where he accidentally does something that could be construed as cheating and I successfully get him kicked out of the tournament.  I was feeling sorry for myself until he told me after the game that he had FORAGES for 90 points elsewhere.
