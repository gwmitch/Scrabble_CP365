#note Missed RELIEVO, though I looked in that spot. Need those extra points and an extra lucky draw here. VEG is probably second best. The F might be very useful to play with OFF down column O.

#note FETAL O6 would have done a lot to get me closer.

#note Are there any cool plays I can make with my rack knowledge? With inference, D1 WAKEN is destroying in sim. I think shedding KW is more important than the positional benefits of WAKEN, but Stefan has nothing good to the W, so I should have a minimum (and probably maximum) of one chance to draw something miraculous up there. I would like to make a play that burns more tiles towards the case D for DJINNI, burning the blank if I have to, but there are no blank burning plays available that do enough damage - K10 WAUKs isn't good enough.
