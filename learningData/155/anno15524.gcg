>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ESTYZ 8D ZESTY +54 54
#note 2013 Nationals, Round 18.
>Charles_Reinke: CEIIKLO D8 .OIC +15 15
#note Didn't see ICELIKE, which looks good to me since there's not many plays that leave me with fishable racks.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ANWX E5 WAX.N +32 86
>Charles_Reinke: AEEIKLU 7D A.E +28 43
#note I initially misentered this rack as AEEIKLV, and commenced a total spaz-attack upon finding that I had "missed" CAVELIKE for 118.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ?DEFGIN H4 DEiF.ING +67 153
>Charles_Reinke: EHIKLLU 11B HI.K +26 69
#note HUCK in the same spot, obviously.  Quackle wants to play 6E AH to fish for GLUELIKE, which I would have tried had I 1.) known GLUELIKE for sure and 2.) actually seen the possibility.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ACDIMOR 6G D.ORAMIC +70 223
>Charles_Reinke: AEEGLLU -  +0 69
#note I had a sliver of doubt on DIORAMIC, and my rack sucks.  The game is almost surely lost unless this can come off the board.  
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: EJNNO M2 ENJO.N +28 251
>Charles_Reinke: AEEGLLU B11 .UGE +16 85
#note This play is pretty bad, given there are five unseen R's and I don't have any.  F2 GLUE is my best bet.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: DHILW 2I WHIL.D +42 293
>Charles_Reinke: AEILLRR 15B RALLIER +83 168
#note If I don't get this break, I might honestly struggle to break 200 this game.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ABBU 14G BABU +16 309
>Charles_Reinke: EEERSUV N6 .UVEE +14 182
#note 10G UNREEVES.  That actually gets me back in the game.  
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: IIPRT 10J PITI.R +14 323
>Charles_Reinke: ERSSTVY K10 .VY +18 200
#note A7 VERST doesn't help me win.  I need to bingo over there.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: EN 9B NE.. +5 328
>Charles_Reinke: ERRSSTT 12I TR.ST +16 216
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: AEGTU O10 .UGATE +27 355
>Charles_Reinke: DELPQRS K1 Q. +11 227
#note A lot of O's left; maybe I can draw PRESOLD.  Then Komol has a seizure and, in the midst of his flailing, manages to place an O at 4G and hit his clock.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: MOO 4K MO.O +26 381
#note Komol was, sadly, seizure-free for the remainder of the game.
>Charles_Reinke: DELOPRS 1G PRO +20 247

>Komol_Panyasophonlert: AOS 13B .OAS +10 411
>Komol_Panyasophonlert:  (?OS) +4 415
#note I played horrible pretty much the entire game and deserved to lose.  I made a few defensible plays but committed a multitude of out-and-out blunders.
