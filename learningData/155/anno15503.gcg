#note Quackle says HONOREE D6 or HERIONE D3, but I prefer to keep a consonant and an E

#note I was hoping she'd hang an N, but I didn't see how it would happen on this board... also REVERIFY but I didn't know that

>M: ?ADEOPQ 3C OP +22 124
#note ...It seems I missed OPAQuED, not sure how that happened... I guess I wasn't thinking about using the blank as a U cause it was so early in the morning for me.  Anyway, besides that, Quackle recommends to play off the Q, which I didn't want to do since I had drawn so many Us the whole tournament, and so I decided to try to anticipate that a bit in this game.  DOPY also works but I figured I might get QUAY so I chose this instead.
>Anne: CGIS I5 CIGS +18 83
#note This was a bit surprising for me.  In hindsight it was a good idea, but still...
>M: ?AAADEQ G7 A.A +8 132
#note Yaaay, drawing two As.  Quackle recommends playing QAID G6, exchanging, or even using the blank for QuAY H1, but I'd rather keep the Q as I said before.  (plus QAID opens an S spot) I also chose AVA over AA due to the possibility of QUAY
>Anne: DELNOSS 3H OLDNESS +73 156
#note Yeah, 2 more Ss.  I figured she had one but not two..
>M: ?ADEQW B2 AW.D +27 159
#note for some reason, I didn't write down this rack
With these tiles, Quackle says QI 6H, WED 9C (I didn't know NICHED and I prefer to keep the E and leave the B9 spot), then this
>Anne: ?AEHMRR 1B cHARMER +94 250
#note Well that backfired.  Also works 1 space to the left making HAWED
>M: ?EEFIJQ L2 J.FE +28 187
#note Q says it's best, works for me too
>Anne: KUY K5 YUK +30 280
#note ow
>M: ?EGIIQU J1 GI. +7 194
#note there's the U I anticipated, the rest of the rack sucks though.  Q says sQUEG K8 for 82 which seems pretty fine for me, even if keeps two Is.  I wasn't thinking to use the blank as an S... QIS comes next (but it plays the Q, I needed to score with it, and seriously why put a Q there) then this

Only bingo BTW
>Anne: DEMO A12 MODE +41 386
#note double ow.  It wasn't as bad though due to what I got next
>M: AILLOPX O8 XI +56 374
#note Q says it's best.  Of note, PLEX L8 plays one of those Ls, rest of the rack after that sucks though

>M: ALLOPRW C11 PLAW +38 412
#note My miss, it's not even good.  But it beats all the other choices, the best of which is PALLOR M9, which I didn't even know
scored as 34  
>Anne: IT L7 IT +9 417
>M: AALORTU M10 AURAL +12 424
#note Okay, this is a key decision
there's only two tiles left and the Z is still out.  My first instinct was to try to Z-stick her with TAO A2, but then something misfired and I thought TAO wasn't even good.  Then I figured if I played that, due to the threat of BOD D10, she'd outscore me and win anyway, so I had to think of something else.  I figured with this play, I'd have at least a chance to go out in one, making her either play the Z for cheap or give me 20 points. 

Moving on, the best play is LOT D10, which wins 55% of the time!  I just wish I knew MILT so I could actually play that... The second best play is just MILO (37%) blocking that spot, followed by MILT (36%).  My play of AURAL ends up being 4th just under those, with a 34% win rate.  Of course if I know MILT that avoids all this.  My initial instinct of TAO only wins 24% of the time.
>Anne: BLNOTTZ 2A Z. +11 428
#note BORTZ!!!  She told me she chickened out on this.  That would allow her to win.  It turned out the D was in the bag making the threat of BOD useless, MILT was still good but she apparently didn't know MILT just like me.  and we're still not done
>M: DOTU 12K TU.D +10 434
#note D10 TOD, D11 OD, D10 DOT, D12 OD, 9D OD, 11B UPDO, and B8 ENQUIRED all win apparently according to Q, but anything leaving just the U in fact doesn't win. The problem is if I leave just a U she can just U-stick me blocking MU F1 and does get enough points to win (unless there's another spot for the U that I just missed).  Leaving UT doesn't work either as she just blocks TAU and can outscore me.  I'd guess leaving OUT doesn't work either for similar reasons, so really given optimal play I can't win here.  As we determined though, neither of us even knew MILT, and given that, this play wins.
>Anne: BLNOTT M1 BO. +14 442
>M: O 12A ...O +12 446
#note Due to my own fail, I thought MO F2 would result in a tie, so I had to try this which I wasn't quite 100% sure of.  Of course it's good but there's no need to take that kind of risk, especially after all this.
>M:  (LNTT) +8 454
#note Final score: 450-442, recounted and found the 4 point error from before, fix'd to 454-442
And that's the story of how I won by making plays that made no logical sense whatsoever!
