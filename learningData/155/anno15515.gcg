>Charles_Reinke: ?EENOSY H7 YE +10 10
#note 2013 Nationals, round 9.  NOSEY is the star play, but I wanted the sure bingo next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ABEENRZ 6F ZEBRA +46 46
#note In hindsight I don't think I gave Charles the respect he deserved this game: I think I probably went into the game trying to outplay him a little bit too hard. 
>Charles_Reinke: ?DELNOS K6 SNoOLED +81 91
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAEENPY L8 YEA +22 68
>Charles_Reinke: DHLNOSX J11 HOLD +20 111
#note Totally forgot that ZEBRAS takes an S.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAEINPR 10J A.. +16 84
#note This is obviously not optimal: the optimal play is ZA.  But I think there's a fairly high chance that Charles doesn't know that AHOLDS is a word, so this seemed like a logical option for the long run, and I'm definitely a favorite here to miss anyway: this is generally not a very favorable position.  Against someone who I thought would know AHOLDS, I'd probably go with ZA here. 
>Charles_Reinke: CCNPSWX -CNPWX +0 111
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEINOPR L12 APO +18 102
#note Seeking to create a D hook he might miss (although I don't think he will), but more importantly protecting the AHOLDS hook for later.
>Charles_Reinke: ACEINST I4 CE.ATINS +80 191
#note I made this play happily, thinking I had closed down the board while up by more than a bingo.  The validity of AHOLDS totally changes the board.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?EINNRV G3 INN.RVEs +76 178
#note As much as this leaves me in trouble, I am now certain that Charles doesn't know the hook.  The S is to try to get Charles to play westward on row 10 more often, preserving the hook for as long as possible.
>Charles_Reinke: DHIMTTU M12 HIM +36 227
#note 15L DUIT.  This play was underscored by 1.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AGLSTTU 4I .ATGUT +18 196
#note Unconventional, but same explanation.  I don't think I saw ZEBRAS-S either, but pretty sure I'd make this play anyway.
>Charles_Reinke: DGOPTTU F9 PUTTO +16 243
>Kenji_Matsumoto: FILNSSX M2 FL.X +28 224
#note Very happy to see PUTTO since it makes AHOLDS blocks less likely.  Despite the score, the Ss are huge: I'm probably a favorite to win this game now even if he did know AHOLDS.
>Charles_Reinke: AADEGRV 4B GRAVE. +20 263
#note I spent a long time on this play, resulting in bad time trouble.  I might have had five minutes on my clock after making this play.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEINQSS L1 QI +26 250
>Charles_Reinke: ADDIORU C3 D.UID +18 281
#note E11 AUDIO?  That seems a little dangerous.  
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEENSSW O1 NEWS +35 285
#note Yes, I actually thought about played WES* 8a for 15 seconds.  I think it's the best play if it were a word.
>Charles_Reinke: AAINORW 2J WA.. +18 299
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEEFIIS E2 FI.E +20 305
>Charles_Reinke: AINORTU N4 .UI +14 313
#note 1H TRANQ.  Bad miss that might have cost me the game.  In simulation, Quackle actually likes 14J DUOMO better even though it scores 30 less, since AINRT will bingo often.  The ugly IOU leave after TRANQ could get uglier with the amount of vowels in the bag.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEEORRS 1G CERO +23 328
#note This is probably just insane, but I did see SECRETOR and didn't play it.  There are lots of good reasons not to play it here, especially since I know he doesn't know AHOLDS and SECRETOR does terribly when trading bingos and doesn't do too well against fishes either, his rack implies vowels, he's in severe time trouble (less than two minutes, and I decided quickly for that reason) and I want to complicate the game.  I also want to get him to try to outrun me rather than fish with those marginal middling racks.  Nevertheless it does have some outscoring options after fishing plays especially if I draw both the K and J, so it's the better static option.  I might play SECRETOR in hindsight, but I understand the reasons for my play and it's not nearly as bad as it probably looks at first glance when you take everything into account.
>Charles_Reinke: AENOORT 12D OO. +6 319
#note Now I just have to hope to bingo, as there's no way I will catch up to him just by scoring.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EGIKORS B6 KIERS +40 368
#note Not really sure what's better here.  I need to block bingo options now and still score enough to win. Either way, I'm not going to be able to block TRENAIL or something like that in column o.  The other realistic option is GROK, but I'm afraid of draws like JLI if I do that.  I think this is the correct option since it blocks pretty much all other bingos and keeps the O for JO in two spots to survive the ugly draws.

#note E10 JEON.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: GILMO A8 MOIL +34 402
>Charles_Reinke: BENR 13A BREN +14 365
#note Somehow missed the higher-scoring spots for this word.
>Charles_Reinke:  (G) +4 369
#note One of my worst-played games of the tournament, I just don't know what to do in late-game situations like the one I found myself in.
