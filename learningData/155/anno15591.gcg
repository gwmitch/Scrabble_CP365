All of the plays Q suggests are exchanges, the only other one being TORN which is bad
>Mike_Wier: DIJPRRT -DIJPR +0 0
#note Yay, what a great start we're off to!
>M: EKNORST 8B REKNOTS +82 82
#note Only bingo (if we don't just count all the other placements).  I think it's worth the extra points to put the E and the S there, Q and championship player agree

#note Screw you and your phonies, Mike.  :P
The first time we played at this tournament he played two phonies on me both of which I was pretty sure were bad but I chickened out on challenging them.  This time, he put this and I chose to challenge because I remember all the adverbs don't take IER/IEST, but oh wait, this one does!  I was even genre savvy enough to say "since this is the one I challenged I know it'll end up being good" as we went to the word judge...
haha, this might have worked out as he didn't play any phonies this game :)
Best is FEZ E11 then ZYME E2.  I like ZYME personally, gives back less and unloads one more thing.
>Mike_Wier: VX 11C V.X +26 106
>M: EFMPTYZ C7 Z.E +47 129
#note Q likes ZYME E2 which seems right, but for some reason I forgot to count the points.  If I saw it was 46 I probably would play it instead
>Mike_Wier: ABD 5B BA.D +20 126
>M: FIMPTUY F11 TUMP +28 157
#note Q likes FUMY F2 (then this), but if I can get a good score while leaving the Y open like that I prefer to take it.  Championship player says FUMY, then PTUI F10, then TUFTY G5, but imo my play is best
>Mike_Wier: AJY 4A JAY +30 156
>M: AFINSVY F2 VINY +32 189
#note well, thank god I left the Y open.  This is best and second best is 15F SAVIN which is 5 points behind this, which I didn't even know in the first place.  Definitely glad I was able to do this
>Mike_Wier: CCH 3D CH.C +14 170
#note Wow I suck, after this I confirmed his score as 180 instead of 170 and it went unnoticed 
>M: AABFFSU H4 BUFF. +16 205
#note oh come on, CHICA?  H1 BAA/ABA is best, or even H2 BAFF.  Another case of a word I don't know.. Best without using the spot is 15F SUBA (no way I'm using the S for that) then 13F MUFF (again didn't know it)
>Mike_Wier: OP E14 OP +8 178
>M: AAAISST I6 AA +14 219
#note Q says this is best but Championship Player actually says I should put it at 6A instead.  I think opening this spot is fine, cause there's nowhere for my hopefully future bingo otherwise (and even if he plays something there it probably will open an S spot, which I should be able to take cause I have 2 Ss)
>Mike_Wier: DE J5 ED +18 196
>M: AILNSST K4 INSTALS +76 295
#note Only bingo again.  Seems I'm just barely squeaking by with the bingos this game
>Mike_Wier: ?AEINRT 13F .ARINaTE +72 268
>M: EGIOQRS 12I QI +24 319
#note Q (and Championship Player) says I should put it at I3.  I prefer to block any possible big plays on that double and the triple, cause I surely don't have anything there.
>Mike_Wier: EEEELRU H13 .UE +9 277
>M: EGILORS 10G GLOS.IER +63 382
#note Whoops, GLORIES.  If I saw that I'd play it cause I like how it closes the triple (only possible to go there with an O).  It does open an A spot but then I probably get an even better score on that triple anyway.  For some reason, this still has 96.98% to win (GLORIES has 98.06%) but I still thought the game was far from over (keep in mind he's 10 pts up..).  I think it's interesting that putting it one over wins 5% less, wasn't expecting that much of a difference haha
>Mike_Wier: AHO 9I HA.O +24 301
>M: EGIMNOT 14K MINT +19 401
#note Boo, no place for EMOTING.  That would have been nice

Q says GENIP 15A which I didn't know (winning 97.65%), then VOMIT C11 which seems good.  BOGIE H4 was also on there but the last thing I need to do is give him a better spot for his bingo.  Q hates this play initially but it really doesn't sim that bad (less than 2% down at 95.87%).

I think I was trying to prevent any silliness down the N column where he could get a lot of points bingoing through R and hooking MARINaTE.  Championship player actually says MOTE in this same spot wins 97.27% so I think my reasoning is good.  Championship player also says this apparently wins less than 89% as it's not even on there and the lowest choice is 89%.  Probably it demands a better leave so I can have a better chance to get a good enough comeback on the triple, cause I could draw something stupid and have no good plays which could allow him to win if he scores enough.  I wanted to keep my E cause given how the tournament went I knew if I played it I wouldn't draw another one, and it fits better with my word knowledge, in other words, I don't know enough words so even if there is a play without the E on the triple, I probably don't know it.  (but I agree EGO is pretty bad especially with all those Os out there).  I also for some reason completely didn't see the hooks END or ENG.  Then again I do have the G... 

Second best according to Championship player is BOGIE (wow that's surprising for me) then VOGIE C11.  I can see why VOGIE is good cause the M would go way better on the triple.  Keep in mind he's 10 pts up so I think I'm only 71 ahead, which would probably kind of matter here
>Mike_Wier: ?ADEGIO N3 DIAlOGE. +59 360
#note Championship player actually says VAGI C11 or GIE or DOG 15M, wut?  I guess with 3 Os left putting the G there isn't good, or it wants him to out-bingo, or idk what else.  This apparently wins less than 3.03% where VAGI wins about 10% (can't remember exact number).  Keep in mind he's still 10 pts up
(ironically, GLORIES earlier would give him GODEtIA.  lol)
>M: GIOR O5 GIRO +30 431
#note I didn't write down my racks starting here, but it doesn't matter as with this play it's game over as he can't get any good enough comebacks.  I initially put this down but then something misfired and I thought it wasn't good, and I picked it back up.  Then I sat there for like 5 minutes thinking if it was good or not and I eventually said "screw this it's good" and put it there.  (ofc it's good)
Championship player says just about anything wins 100%, but keep in mind I thought he had 10 extra points
>Mike_Wier: ELOW C11 .OWEL +24 384
>M: DEENO B12 DONE +25 456
#note Oops, NODE in the same place scores 1 more
>Mike_Wier: RTU L2 RUT +10 394
#note 15J RUT scores 2 more
>Mike_Wier:  (E) +2 396
#note Final score 406-456.  Still can't believe I messed up the score...
