>Joshua_Sokol: AEFIPQV 8E FAVE +20 20
#note I hate playing QI first turn or having it played on me. I also hated the leave it left me with. The placement to me seems just as good if not better than the one with the A on the star, but Jack's next move proves me wrong.
>Jack: AANNORZ F6 ZO. +32 32
#note jn: it's tempting to sacrifice points for ANR. i like that this doesn't allow a lot of scoring opportunity and it scores well.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILPT -D +0 20
#note I exchanged Q here, not D. Annotation mistake.
>Jack: AAINNRS 6E A.AN +13 45
#note jn: champ player likes NA G5, NA(Z)I or A(Z)AN. I like NA(Z)I because if i don't hit a bingo, I might be able to score with nazis. JS: I like NAZI here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILPT F3 EPI... +17 37
#note This was terrible. For some reason I thought I had another E and I didn't even check my rack afterward. TIEPI(N) for sure.
>Jack: BIINRST 3A BRINI.ST +72 117
#note Of course Jack fully capitalizes on my mistake :P
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIKLOT B2 C.OAK +42 79
#note I knew neither BACKLIT (A3) or CATKIN (H1)
>Jack: ADMRUVW H1 VA.U +24 141
#note jn: quackle likes va(t)u a lot.
>Joshua_Sokol: FILRRST 5E F.L +24 103
>Jack: ?DJMRTW 5A J.W +13 154
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIRRST E8 .IRRIEST +72 175
>Jack: ?DDEMRT 14B DRE.T +16 170
#note jn: I didn't know what to play here. any ideas? JS: DREST looks good to me. I think with your leave and a close score defense is smart.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHORSY 10C GO.Y +16 191
#note STOGY/STOGEY.
>Jack: ?DDIMQU 12C QU.D +28 198
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHLRS 9H HEALERS +67 258
#note I didn't know HAVERELS. That may be a better option.
>Jack: ?DEEIIM K7 ME.InIDE +70 268
>Jack: ?DEEIIM --  -70 198
#note jn: ItEMI(S)ED and DIME(R)IzE are the two I missed here. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AGLTUXY J6 GAL.XY +37 295
#note I'm happy about that won challenge, but I should have seen ITEMISED and DIMERIZE as well, so both Jack and I made mistakes this turn.
>Jack: ?DEEIIM K9 .IED +29 227
>Joshua_Sokol: CIOOTUW L11 WO +25 320
#note hmmm, blocking the RS lanes with something like COU(R)T or OUTC(R)OW (which I didn't know at the time) might be better than this...
>Jack: ?BEIMOT M2 BIOMETe. +74 301
#note jn: according to Q champ playa BEvOMIT(S) wins 29% 
	BIOMET(R)y wins 23%
	MI(S)BEgOT wins 22%
	BIOMETe(R) wins 20%
JS: I guess my idea that BIOMETRy was better here was right. Told ya Jack! ;) But BEvOMITS is a killer!
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIORTU 1E OUT.IE +9 329
#note With a blank in the bag I didn't know what to do here other than block. I always have this bad feeling that I'm in a worse position that my opponent which causes me to play paranoid. Well, in any case, I missed (and didn't know) (T)OREUTIC 15E. Besides that obvious play I should probably play COR(B)IE or (S)COUTER anyway. OUTVIE is actually up there though.
>Jack: ?DILOPT L3 PLOD +29 330
#note jn: q really likes plod or topi
>Joshua_Sokol: AACEEMU N1 EAU +19 348
#note I felt like I needed to luck out here, since the H(e) plays on lane 8 are killers. I needed to keep my M and hope for a triple play next turn. My intuition was correct according to the sim. This is up by almost 4%.
>Jack: ?INNORT 1N .N +6 336
#note jn: i was really paranoid of HA or HM, but i think this was a mistake because 8L is open anyways. I think the only way I win this game is if I can get the H or the M and have 8L or O2 open or bingo.
JS: when he played this I was pretty happy. Him bingoing through the T seemed pretty remote to me, and this meant he didn't have the H. I really lucked out. NO 13L is the play here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEGMN 8L M.AN +33 381
#note I mean I had to play this. I was really hoping he wouldn't have a bingo out. This is around a 65% win.
>Jack: ?HINORT 10N HO +27 363
#note jn: best is to go sNORT M11 here first for 21 and then HI at 10N or 2J 27 or 26 respectively next. snort also blocks scene or sec.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEGNS 15A CEE +20 401
#note -14 for me. SCENE must not have been an easy find for me...
>Jack: ?INRT 15E .INTeR +17 380
#note jn: orient is one more.
>Jack:  (GNS) +8 388
#note JS: I made some good plays and some terrible plays, and barely won. This was a stressful (but fun!) game that came down to luck.
