#note This is Collins. I held it for a while, but did not challenge. This is because I wasn't sure if it was good at all, Komol playing it over other equally good bingos indicated that it was more likel to be good, and even if it got challenged off my position was quite bad. I just went for spread.

#note I didn't see FAQIR. After all this time, I still miss these Q plays so much. I don't think it's better here, but perhaps challenging off EPILoGIC and playing FAQIR would've given me a reasonable position. If I draw TORSION or something I can win. Maybe I should've made that desperation play. Here though, FAQIR doesn't seem to work.
