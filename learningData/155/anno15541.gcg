#note I'm gonna upload this one just because I feel like it, no racks, no nothing.
>Robin_Lewis: AEFINRT 7B FAINTER +73 95
#note Oh wheee, I stopped tracking after this play. I'd gone 7-0 the first day, thought everything was so chill, but boy was I wrong. This was the 7th game on the second day, I was smothered with a subpar 2-4 that day until that game, and right when she played this I knew that this wasn't mine to win.
>Siddharth_Murali: KNO F9 .ONK +19 42
#note Open, open, I should open right!? Well this is what happens when I play an open board, ladies and gentlemen
>Robin_Lewis: ?AEHIMT 11E A.THEMIc +98 193
#note Hehe, scrabble is hilarious sometimes. I tried to not get agitated, I just laughed it off.
>Siddharth_Murali: IQ 6D QI +24 66
>Robin_Lewis: EIVW 5E WIVE +32 225
>Siddharth_Murali: FILORSV 4H FRIVOLS +93 159
#note Of course the 114 point FRIVOLS had to be blocked, but I was just happy to get a bingo down. I knew I would get smothered, but I like to make things look like a contest when it really isn't.
>Robin_Lewis: AETU H11 .AUTE +27 252
#note I'm thinking, 'Why is she opening when ahead, why is she opening when ahead?! I'm excited!' Oh derp. I failed to realize that she HAD to have the other blank.
>Siddharth_Murali: ELOU K3 O.ULE +16 175
#note I can't really do much, putting 16 points on the board was such a struggle... 
>Robin_Lewis: AOTU 4C AUTO +17 269
#note What should I be thinking here? Well, i was just thinking she was fishing and I could catch up, but boy was I wrong.
>Siddharth_Murali: HM 10J HM +34 209
#note Hah! Our scores actually have the same first digit, cool!
>Robin_Lewis: AEN 8A NAE +16 285
#note I'm still utterly clueless as to what she's doing, I didn't realize she was about to burn me with the blank.
>Siddharth_Murali: BDI 3A DIB +20 229
>Robin_Lewis: ?AEIOST 14H .OASTIEr +68 353
#note So she spent like five minutes on this turn, and i'm like 'OMG, she has a tough rack!' Haha, I was hitting myself in the head.. 
>Siddharth_Murali: ABCNO 2B BACON +35 264
#note I remember holding a crappy leave, but of course, it had no impact on the game. "THE RESULT DOESN'T CHANGE"- atiruth
>Robin_Lewis: GOY O12 GO.Y +27 380
>Siddharth_Murali: CILNORS 15B INCLOS.R +65 329
#note Of course, I don't study 8's, and I haven't seen this from playing, so I decided to 'make it up'. She apparently hadn't either, and she held. Of course, released because she had a 60 point bomb coming up...

#note I wasn't agitated, I was just laughing it off... 
>Siddharth_Murali: ADGNPRR N10 GRAD. +17 368
#note Now that you guys can see my full rack, you can tell that I had no intention of making the best play :)
>Robin_Lewis: IST M3 S.IT +8 472
>Robin_Lewis:  (PRN) +10 482
#note 482-368! I did the job of making this look like a half-contest, while it was nowhere near one. I'm patting myself on the back :)
