>Charles_Reinke: ACIMRST H4 MICRA +24 24
#note 2013 Nationals, round 17.  Exchanging just the M is very tempting here, but I don't want to fall into that exchanging-exchanges trap.
>Peter_Armstrong: ENO I3 EON +10 10
>Charles_Reinke: AAEKRST 2H KARATES +80 104
>Peter_Armstrong: ?AEHNOT L2 .HiONATE +72 82
>Charles_Reinke: AINOTTW K5 WITAN +34 138
#note A more fish-oriented play like K4 TWO is also an option.  This play sets up too many high-scoring plays at J6, including potential Z-bombs.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?EIOTTU M9 TImEOUT +68 150
#note At least I blocked the double-double placement of this play!
>Charles_Reinke: ELNORTY 15J NET.LY +30 168
#note ELYTRON in multiple spots.  I recently played the phony ELYTRONS* at club so I should be able to see this.  If this was the 2007 Nationals, I wouldn't have missed it, but now my brain is full of lower-probability nonsense.  For a double dose of misery, 15J TROTYL is also better.  
>Peter_Armstrong: FIZ 1M FIZ +52 202
>Charles_Reinke: BGJMORS 6J J.. +26 194
#note 6J JINGO is a lot better.  I saw it next turn as an extension.
>Peter_Armstrong: E M1 ..E +22 224
>Charles_Reinke: BGLMORS 12L G.RM +20 214
#note 5D GLOBIN/GOBLIN open up the board a little more, but this play is fine as long as I can draw one or two vowels to my BLOS leave.

>Peter_Armstrong: EEW 13C EWE +14 309
>Charles_Reinke: ABILOQS 12D ABOIL +31 290
#note I should dump the Q now for twelve and try to hit a bingo on row 12.
>Peter_Armstrong: DIINU O7 INDIU. +27 336
>Charles_Reinke: ABEGOQS 8J Q.. +12 302
#note Fishing for a D, R, or N.
