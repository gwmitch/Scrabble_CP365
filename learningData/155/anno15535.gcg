#note 2013 Nationals, round 29.
>Mack_Meller: AFIW I2 WAIF +18 18
>Charles_Reinke: CEEGOTV 6B COVETE. +21 35
#note J1 VEG is better.  The double-double line on column E is too easy to hit.

#note Underscored by 2.

#note I wasn't sure of either FOLIUMS or FOLIOUS.  This is the only bingo that's not one of those words.
>Mack_Meller: ADM 12C DAM +29 151
>Charles_Reinke: AEOORSU O1 USER +33 176
#note OSE or OSAR are vastly superior.  It makes sense to use the S here because it's not very useful on this board.  Mack held WAXINGS, so I probably could have waited to cash in on this spot if he wasn't going to.
>Mack_Meller: EIILO 8A OILIE. +21 172
>Charles_Reinke: AEENOOU -EOOU +0 176
#note A11 BEANO is worth it.  I didn't see it.
>Mack_Meller: IPTZ H11 .PITZ +57 229
>Charles_Reinke: AEHNNST 10A AH +27 203
#note ENNST isn't terrible since I have an I to play through, but 13A THAN is better.  I didn't even really look at plays on row 13.

>Charles_Reinke: GKNRTTW K11 KN.W +22 315
#note Quackle's superior circuitry-driven intelligence is informing me that I should exchange all of them instead of trying to play through.  Mack's next play will probably put him up by around 30 points, a deficit that will be extremely hard to make up with so few tiles in the bag and so few hotspots.  I accede to the power of the machines.
>Mack_Meller: DRY I7 DRY +20 343
>Charles_Reinke: AEGJRTT 15L JAG. +20 335
#note Quackle wants me to fish off the J, but I don't see any bingos that could result from that.  I should at least see J8 TAJ.

>Mack_Meller: ?EG 15E GeE. +16 381
>Mack_Meller:  (ERTT) +8 389
#note I made a lot of subtly bad plays this game.  COVETED was not a huge mistake, but Mack's horrible-rack-turned-bingo made it seem really bad.  Final score: 349-389.
