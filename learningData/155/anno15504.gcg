#note I somehow take offense to that.  The name of the game is offense.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIIISU -IIIU +0 0
#note No Is on the board, I keep one.  Q disagrees.

>Ryan_Fischer: EEGIRSY A7 YE. +27 65
#note GREYIS(H) may be a good play, but I need to slow down if I ever hope to catch him.
>Matthew_Bernardina: BITT O5 BITT. +30 254
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGIRRS F2 GREASI.R +65 130
#note And oddly, I'd have a 3x3 if I didn't play to the H.  I'm choosing a placement that opens the board to the max.
>Matthew_Bernardina: IQ N6 QI +64 318
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEILNU B1 ALIUNDE +79 209
#note That is helpful.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AK A1 KA +38 356
#note That?  Not so much.  Especially since I have the Z.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGORTUZ E5 ZA +46 255
#note I figured Matt wouldn't buy OUTGRAZ(E).  Still playing to maximize points and keep lines open.  AZO opens an N hook but kills the easy S lane.  Playing 2 tiles is better here, I think.  ZA is fine.

#note (!)  There's life in these veins, yet!
>Matthew_Bernardina: EEINNTV 15F VENETI.N +83 471
#note ...or maybe not.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIIPS E10 .IPA +12 359
#note EPISCIA, no go.  PISCINAE (also PACIFIES, PIRACES).  I saw PIN, passed it up as it kills too many lines.  Q gives it the best chance of winning.  A whole 0.6%!  The sim likes (M)ICA keeping EIPS.  I did this to open more lanes, shuck an extra vowel.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DLLNORU 11H DULL.R +14 485
#note Q likes DOLOUR best, but it doesn't block the E.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEIJNS 1G J.E +10 369
#note Didn't want to kill the O line, thought of opening another one instead.

>Ryan_Fischer: CEINOOS 14L .OO +16 385
>Matthew_Bernardina: DNO 2H .DON +10 513
#note Good block.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEGINSS A1 ..S +9 394
#note Looks like the sim wants me to take CESS while I can.  I'd rather at least see if Matt might screw up here, as well as setting myself up.
