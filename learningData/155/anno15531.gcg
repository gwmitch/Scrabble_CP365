#note 2013 Nationals, Round 25.
>Charles_Reinke: BFLPTWW -BFLWW +0 0
#note If I want to make a fancy expert-player-type-fish, I should keep LP, not PT.  Keeping T sims best.

>Lou_Cornelis: AAEIIRS 1H A.IARIES +149 171
#note Well that sucked.
>Charles_Reinke: BGHIJKW 5H H.WK +28 97
#note I did not see any of my plays on the G column.  Let's just chalk it up to PTSD (post triple-triple stress disorder).
>Lou_Cornelis: ADEIMN 8J MEDINA +37 208
>Charles_Reinke: ABGIJST N6 JI. +26 123
#note I'm pretty sure my thought process was something like "make a sweet B hotspot while not blocking too many lanes".  The only problem being that M7 doesn't qualify as a sweet B hotspot.  
>Lou_Cornelis: UX 10J XU +53 261
>Charles_Reinke: ABEGRST M7 B.G +18 141
#note I guess M7 did turn out to be a "BIG" hotspot.  Get it?  Get it????
>Lou_Cornelis: ORTY M7 ...OTRY +26 287
#note Creative play!  Underscored by two.

>Charles_Reinke: EFFHUUW 12H HUFFE. +38 253
#note D1 WUSHU was just blocked, but I didn't even care because I had this play available.  Too bad it's phony.  I can't imagine there are a lot of people out there who would be able to challenge with confidence.

>Charles_Reinke: DIILNOR H12 ..IR +21 304
#note I'm trying to think if there's a reason why I didn't play HAIL in the same spot.  Wait, I got it!  It's because I totally didn't see it!
>Lou_Cornelis: AEOPS N10 PASEO +59 476
#note I wish I could say that I knew HUFFER was phony and that I insta-challenged this play.
>Charles_Reinke: CDEILNO 14B CLONE +29 333
#note There's two blanks in the bag and a usable line on row 10.  We're going for those blanks.

#note 10B MANKIND or PANDANI are better, but two blanks = twice the pain.
