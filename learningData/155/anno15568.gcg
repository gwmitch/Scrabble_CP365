>Will: EGGOOPT 8G GOGO +12 12
>Brandon: NTW J7 T.WN +9 9
>Will: ABEKPTZ 7F KAB +18 30
#note Close with other stuff but this seems OK especially over BEZANT, which gives back way too many different kinds of plays (S hook, Z scoring plays)
>Brandon: DEX 9F DEX +29 38
>Will: EINPSTZ 11J SPITZ +40 70
#note WINZE has high upside but I was a little spooked by TOWN to start off.
>Brandon: CEEEM 10C EMCEE +21 59
>Will: AEINSUW N9 WI.ENS +40 110
#note I missed K4 UNWISE, which scores pretty well, doesn't open me up to huge counterplay like WIZENS does, and leaves the useful A to play underneath the Z. I like that play best, though WAUK also bingos 50+% according to sim. The board's not great for esses but it's got a whole bunch of nice through tiles for EINS after WAUK. Either of those would have worked fine, though I think I prefer UNWISE.

#note My AIOUUY anamonic comes in handy again: GG.

>Will: ?DEFHIS 8B FEH +35 238
#note Missed 13K FIEND, though I was cognizant of VIGIL. FEH is fine, though.

#note or HUMID, tough call.

>Brandon: DEEFORV --  -86 284
#note Brandon played this after looking at it upside-down and thinking it was FERVOURED*, a much more reasonable attempt. I held without noticing the transposition and started doing endgame stuff until I looked up after a couple minutes and realized what happened.
>Will: AANOORT 14E ROOT +16 394
#note Too difficult for my brain to figure out what play was best given the ARS in the bag that was coming. Is there some kind of S setup to be made somewhere? It sure doesn't look like it.
>Brandon: DEEFORV I2 DEF. +20 304
>Will: AAANRS 12B AR.ANA +8 402
#note Low on time, one off of CARNS/NARCS.
