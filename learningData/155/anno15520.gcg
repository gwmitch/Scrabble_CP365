#note 2013 Nationals, round 14.  Disaster strikes this game when my pen goes AWOL.  The only other writing utensil on my person is a mechanical pencil.  I hate pencils.  Whenever Orry's clock is running I discreetly scan the floor around me for the missing article, but it doesn't turn up until later that night when my brother realizes that he had grabbed it from the table while we were chatting.  Lesson learned: always bring a second pen.

#note M2 QUIZ.  The Z isn't likely to help me this early in the game.

#note Orry excitedly started putting down a triple-triple at 1A, then realized he didn't have the correct letters.  So I know that he has an S, but that was almost guaranteed anyway.
