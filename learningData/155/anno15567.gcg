#note I have learned the hard way that I need to be proactive about opening up against Paul, so I prefer this to something like exchange I or OI. Actually, though, I think my biggest mistake here was not playing ARENITIC# (I'm being serious, I think it would stay).

#note 7F NIDE/DINE are simming best. That does not look very good at all, losing my D for ICED and crippling my ability to hit bingos with a front hook on ICE. NIDE would be great with an S, but here? Not buying it. Paul is going to sacrifice to play defense.

#note I saw MARTYR, but I don't think I noted that the Y hit the 3LS. I whiffed the DJINNY hook for RYOT/YORE. I don't care for 2M MY. It would have probably saved the game if I don't make a mistake here and play MARTYR/RYOT.

#note Agonizing decision between QATS and DURR. Gotta keep it close so that my eventual bingo actually matters.

#note C11 ZIG is the play, gotta leave two high scoring spots to bingo, and avoiding a 4C leave is nice too.

#note Out of time, went over 2 minutes (needlessly). This game was completely winnable, just wasn't focused enough.
