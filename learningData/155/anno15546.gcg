#note I only saw WAP E10, not PEW/PAW E4. I made this play to open the board. But CERT is a lot better than I thought it was/APR is a lot worse than I thought it was. So WAP is probably just better than this. And PAW is definitely better.

#note I didn't like FERN or JOIN at all. They just seem to be putting me a turn behind with a leave that doesn't do enough. Maybe that doesn't make sense. After FERN I can often draw JAPE H1, meaning the rack often isn't so bad. And it does score points.

#note This is good partially because it saves GYRON for next turn!

#note Unfortunately, I was nowhere near sure GYRON was good! I also missed ORBY I5, which may be better than this.
