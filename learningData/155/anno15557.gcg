>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAENPW H8 AW +10 10
#note After my worst loss of the tournament so far, I felt a bit weak. I still hoped I could get the best of Paul, but he wasn't in his best form either, due to the cold room+bronchitis. Oh, and I missed PAWNAGE. Cool. Or maybe I just whiffed on it.
>Paul_Avrin: OPU G7 UPO +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENPRY I7 PYE +27 37
#note 0/3. PLENARY and UNDERPAY missed.
>Paul_Avrin: IIIII -IIIII +0 17
#note At least I kind of forced an exchange.
>Joshua_Sokol: ??ACNNR 10A NARCeiN +65 102
#note For some reason after 4 minutes here I forgot that I had seen sCANNeR and thought this was the only option. Ugh...
>Paul_Avrin: ADEERRT D5 RETRA.ED +74 91
#note Paul took a good 6 minutes here, and I understand, cause it looks like there should really be something through the N. It was now my cue to play fast.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHIOSV A8 HO.GI +30 132
#note SHOVI(N)G? I don't like it...

>Paul_Avrin: IQ J6 QI +35 160
>Joshua_Sokol: BEJOSTU 6G JO +23 194
#note I guess this wasn't the best option, but again, I'm playing fast. 
>Paul_Avrin: DEILN K5 LINED +28 188
>Joshua_Sokol: BERSTUV -BUV +0 194
#note SUBVERT. Exchanging here was a big mistake. Even just playing off the V is far better.

#note S(E)LENIUM. I've missed like 6 bingos this game. I didn't know it though, and UM is much better with SS left.
