#note There are actually three places to play OXY here, and I didn't really think about any of them. And they're all probably better than what I played.

#note HEW is a little better because of the FF synergy. Cool.

>Noah: ADEIPTT D1 PEAT +24 327
#note After thinking about quite a few choices here, it came down to PEAT vs. OXIDATE. I just couldn't justify being so aggressive. Quackle likes OXIDATE, for what that's worth, and it does get a little closer to the blank. Hm.

>Noah: DIILNOT N11 NITID +22 349
#note I figured I probably am going to need the blank to win so I played to get the best chance at it. I can see myself winning without the blank I suppose, though it's not too likely. IDOL J1 is probably better than this, just because it keeps better while also not opening the triple for scoring.

#note Aaaand I make a horrible error. I did 9-7 = 3 or some nonsense, thinking there were three in the bag even thought I knew BDEGINRTU was the pool. If I had known I would've played WaLKER M1 or KA 14B as we discussed after the game. But no.

#note And I still messed up the game! I didn't see any winning plays, so I looked to find a bingo, going 4 minutes over. It seemed like GROPE would have to be best. But no! ELOPER ties it by not setting up GRID. Komol could've won with DRIP or BURP. I tried this because I thought it could be good.
