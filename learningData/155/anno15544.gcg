>Siddharth_Murali: AEILOTU H4 LOUIE +12 12
#note Toughie, OUTLIE looks best because TA isn't 2 points of an improvement over A and OUTLIE avoids putting a vowel next to the double letter square.
>Tracy_Bowman: AGILOST 4E GAL.IOTS +68 68
#note First laid down otalgies, then changed to this.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AADHTY 5J YAH +32 44
#note Best. Didn't know H(E)ADSTAY, but it's much worse anyway.
>Tracy_Bowman: BI E4 .IB +12 80
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AADELT 8G D.ALATEs +59 103
#note OMG, I'm WAY too paranoid. I wanted to unfork the board so it could be shut down as soon as possible, but there are much, much better plays available. DATEABLE is the only 8 letter word above 59 points, but I could have just played a 7. (-21)
>Tracy_Bowman: AO 6D A.O +7 87
>Siddharth_Murali: CNORSTU M7 R.COUNTS +78 181
#note Only bingo, hell of a draw.
>Tracy_Bowman: AADEIMN 13H ANIMA.ED +62 149
#note Maybe I should watch out when my opponent anounces '74' when their play doesn't touch a double word square.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEFGHUU 14J FUG. +36 217
#note Very tough decision here. The A is a glaring hotspot but I couldn't take it without retaining both U's. I made the best play equitywise, but the sim likes HADE better, and I can see why. Note that FADE sims way lower, because with HADE i might be able to play FUGU next turn.
>Tracy_Bowman: CKP H12 P.CK +45 194
#note And I get burned.. 
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEHIUW O11 HI.ED +33 250
#note WHE(E) for 38.
>Tracy_Bowman: BEN -  +0 194
#note Lost challenge.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEIPTUW N4 WIPE. +17 267
#note Bad equitywise, but everything above this seems to open new lanes while this shuts down an important one.
>Tracy_Bowman: BEN O3 BEN +14 208
>Siddharth_Murali: ADELOTU 3J TEAL +23 290
#note Sims much better than it appears on SP. Again, bad equitywise but everything else cracks the board open.
>Tracy_Bowman: JMNO 10J JOM.N +32 240
>Siddharth_Murali: DGNOORU 11I GOD +25 315
>Tracy_Bowman: I 15H .I +6 246
>Siddharth_Murali: ANORRSU G8 .URR +6 321
#note Right idea, wrong word. RAIN 7f sims best, but DOUR, DURN, DURO, and DURA all sim near the top. I needed to disturb the last lane available after her fish.
>Tracy_Bowman: EIRW 11C WIRE. +16 262
>Siddharth_Murali: AFNORST 12C OF +25 346
#note Hah, fanworts. I actually knew it too.
>Tracy_Bowman: OZ F2 ZO. +32 294
>Siddharth_Murali: AENRSTV 7C VASE +22 368
#note Who cares about equity, something like VAN or VAT is just dumb. Scored as 24.
>Tracy_Bowman: ETV 13A VET +24 318
