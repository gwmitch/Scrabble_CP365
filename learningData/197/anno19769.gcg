#note M10 TOWIE is better. 1200 iterations @ 2 plies puts TOWIE 2.1 equity points ahead. Not a horrible blunder, maybe my play is more defensive?

#note Quackle, I'm not playing DRIPT or DIPT and TOQUET putting the I at 8M...sorry. (-6) but I think my play is fine.

>Joey_Krafchick: BFHSTTY B13 F.B +13 196
#note 1000 iterations @ 2 plies puts many many plays between 79-80.5%, 14 to be exact. FYTTE at L6 is slightly better than all the other options. I think my play works simply because I'm preventing him for hitting an easy 30 point dump off play with the D in DISH.

#note I keep forgetting about the T hook apparently. Earlier I should have acknowledged that I probably just whiffed it, I just forgot to I guess. My play sims well but AGITA or GUTTAat M7 wins the 2 plies sim after 1000 iterations. The T hook keeps on creating problems but nothing significant I guess...(-4)

#note He saw it!
>Joey_Krafchick: EEIRTUU 14H UTERI +9 285
#note With 2 blanks out, I prefer this especially since only the F can burn me at L15 but I might get it with 31 unseen! ETUI is the other option (besides exchanging, which isn't necessary here) that is good (5J) since it scores something and blocks stuff up.
