>Joshua_Sokol: AAEINTZ H4 ZEATIN +50 50
#note Given what happened last game I considered playing a phony hoping she'd give me one of the tiles that forms an 8 with this rack!
>Vera_Bigall: UX G8 XU +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEPRTV I3 VAT +23 73
#note VARA looks good as well here.
>Vera_Bigall: EIR 4H ..IRE +28 50
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGILP K3 P.IG +14 87
#note I didn't like scoring so few here but there really isn't much scoring to be done on this board. Maybe GRIP is better despite the GRIPE hook increasing her options, since (V)A(P)OR is a slight possibility after this play and I don't have an S, but these are very small things. GRIP increases her bingo chances, so I didn't want to play it.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADOSSUU K10 UDOS +27 221
#note I missed the flashy 11E A(R)SO(N)OUS here, but this has to be right.
>Vera_Bigall: ELO 11D LO.E +8 128
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGNRSS N3 SANGERS +71 292
#note Even though I knew SANGERS was valid before this tournament, I doubted it slightly here. I considered my options: there were really none, unless... I could fish off my E at 11L! For what, you ask? Well for some reason I saw that I could draw into GR(E)ASIN(ES)S through three disconnected tiles! But I thought better of it and played the bingo. I should have made the fish.
>Vera_Bigall: ??EIORU M7 mOUsIER +68 196
#note Really hard decision here for Vera as she is basically in the position I was in last game with 2-blank rack. I think ROUpIEr is the right play though, just in case she can draw something at O9 sometime in the future, although it is very unlikely that that spot will stay open. There are still other spots though.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHIQTU 8L H..A +33 325
#note Gotta block that spot to clinch the win. Hopefully I can play my Q for a lot next turn.
>Vera_Bigall: ACFH 13B CHAF. +26 222
>Joshua_Sokol: AILQTUV 10B VIA +16 341
#note ugh, missing QUA(L)I(A).
>Vera_Bigall: DINP 5D DIPN.. +18 240
>Joshua_Sokol: JLQTTTU E3 QU.LT +14 355
#note deserved for my miss last turn. At least I didn't draw the A and miss it again.
>Vera_Bigall: IW 7C WI. +10 250
>Joshua_Sokol: CEJRTTY B4 JETTY +24 379
#note After I played this I saw what it had opened and regretted not thinking a bit longer and playing JE(U) at 4C, the other option. Maybe that's a better play. My leave is much better after JETTY though
>Vera_Bigall: BO A8 BO +33 283
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEORW 12J ..W. +14 393
#note I don't know what to play here. I left one in the bag to induce mistakes.

#note -14 to RECO(D)E, damn
>Vera_Bigall: IINT F2 TI +15 318
