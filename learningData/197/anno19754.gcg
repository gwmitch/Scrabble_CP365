#note sometimes i need to make moves like this to at least try to open the board. i know it sims bad but quackle likes things like B13 WON or the ridiculous G5 SWUM. G6 UNMEW looks ok though. -8
>elkins: II -II +0 317
>cesar: ENOPSUY F10 YUP +21 300
#note i missed some great chances at coming back with G2 OYES or maybe G1 SEPOY. OYES is 42 and actually puts me ahead next turn. i think i was too concerned about the score and thought he'd still be a tempo ahead. (-5)

#note WOVEN is ok, could draw miracles. shoulda maybe done it last turn and i'd be in much better shape.
