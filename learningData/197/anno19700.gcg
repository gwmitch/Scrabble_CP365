>Joshua_Sokol: DEEGIOO H4 GOODIE +20 20
#note Game on! Hoping this year not to suffer from the curse that attacked me last year in Lake George, granting me my "worst tournament" ribbon. First game was against Marlon, what a treat! He also held this and briefly I started to worry that I was going to choke from the very start.
>Marlon_Hill: AEEOSTV 4H .AVOT +18 18
#note Marlon's racks are also provided! I would have played I3 VOE here but I understand that Marlon wanted to open the board against me. Maybe VOE was simply missed.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEFJN G6 DEAF +31 51
#note It was a really interesting decision here between pursuing a volatile board with 3K JANE, hoping to blow up my score early; J2 JA(V)A for the sake of pure equity and strong scoring potential for next turn with something like F(A)DEIN/F(A)DER through the first A in JAVA; or finally, opting to counter Marlon's open-board play with a paralyzing G6 DEAF, which, albeit perhaps only temporarily, closes down a full quadrant of the board, most of the proficient 7 lanes and 5 of the 8 lanes on the board. Of course, I don't normally want to keep a J, but K3 and other prospects made this decision takeable. 
>Marlon_Hill: AEEEPSS M1 PEASE +24 42
#note This is the precise leave I imagined he kept. I like this play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AJNNRSU 2J JAN.S +56 107
#note I was lucky to have drawn the S, but in fact, I was quite happy that keeping the J worked out this well, as after DEAF I am very unlikely to have the J and so opponent's plays will not account for that possibility. But this was one of the best case scenarios.
>Marlon_Hill: BEEELOS 1K LO.ES +31 73
#note This implied an S he didn't actually have. On one hand, an S inference will alter my play in a way that will benefit Marlon, as I'll likely turn over less tiles and also sacrifice points to keep the board closed, keeping Marlon within reach of me. But on the other, Marlon can't do much now that his best bingo tile is gone. I like this play given its exploitative benefits, but I might play E(P)EE here.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEMNRRU F5 RUM +19 126
#note Whew, I'm glad MURREEN* was made up after all
>Marlon_Hill: BEEFLOT E2 FLOE +18 91
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEENR J4 .ENERAtE +62 188
#note I didn't look long at all as I had been using much more clock than Marlon, admittedly. So I jumped on this and didn't imagine there was anything else. (V)ENEREAl is quite better as it scores 2 more and doesn't allow for a word hooking an S or D to my play.
>Marlon_Hill: BESTTUU 8J .EBUTS +33 124
>Joshua_Sokol: GIKNOOR L8 .ROOKING +84 272
#note I just drew that
>Marlon_Hill: AENTUWZ -  +0 124
#note challenged out of desperation
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIINNT 11C ACTININ. +70 342
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIINNT --  -70 272
#note why must I be greedy? I talked myself out of this many times before pulling the trigger. Turns out it was a toy gun.
>Marlon_Hill: AENTUWZ 15H TWAN. +27 151
#note Maybe Marlon missed WA(L)TZ 3C here, but this is a very good play nonetheless, as it covertly sets up his Z very well. I would play WALTZ.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIINNT N8 .ITANIC +22 294
#note the correct play is 14J TA(N)NIC even if the Z isn't inferred, since the Z will always be something to worry about.
>Marlon_Hill: AEHPUXZ 5J .X +36 187
#note If only Marlon could have drawn one of those I's... 7B EXHU(MED) looks to be the play here, since it more or less guarantees much more than OX/EX a 60-point play with the Z next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINUVY 2B UNI.Y +38 332
>Marlon_Hill: ACEHPUZ 1F ACHE +32 219
#note still hoping for an I
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ELRRVY 14J YE. +29 361
#note Finally blocking the spot.
>Marlon_Hill: PRUZ 11I Z.R. +26 245
#note I no longer have his full racks. It doesn't matter anyway, the game was over, he gave up
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HLLRRV B1 L.V +6 367
#note getting greedy, but this just about never bingos, so H(I)L(I) 13K is fine.
>Marlon_Hill: DMT 13K T.M.D +19 264
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABHLRR 1A B.AH +50 417
#note what a draw
>Marlon_Hill: IPQU O4 QUIP. +26 290
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IILORR 14E LIRI +8 425
#note this endgame was impossible to solve given my lack of time and the necessity to basically stick Marlon with tiles to maximize spread. I just found an out in two and stuck with it. -4 to D5 pRIOR.
>Marlon_Hill: DGITW 15D WIT +14 304
#note -7 to 4D W(O)G, the play pRIOR blocked.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?OR 12G ORa +13 438
>Joshua_Sokol:  (DG) +8 446
