#note Same play for three fewer points at N2 is best, says championship player. About a point in winning percentage, and 1.5 in valuation.
>Margaret: BEGIL N2 BILGE +33 74
#note And this is probably the reason: it's too easy for the opponent to score good points there.
>Steve: ??EIOSU O6 sErIOUS +79 201
#note A couple of plays garner an extra point, including SOUbiSE.

#note First major error. Plays that dump tiles and both Us top the list, starting with D9 (L)UNULAR, for 16, and continuing with N(E)URULA and (L)UNULA. Winning percentage drops from 83 to 77 with this mistake.

#note The wheels are coming off the bus, now that I have to play with difficult racks. Best is 5c ULVA, followed by 10A VAN.

#note Not the best of racks to enter an end game. But board vision is critical. 
This play isn't terrible, per se, but it only leaves one in the bag. Quackle points out L6 (E)RS which scores 27 and leaves the optimal two in the bag. CROFT will probably still be there on the next turn if needed. The difference is a drop in winning percentage from 45 to 34. That's huge. Even 13L R(E)V for a mere 8 points beats out CROFT.

>Steve: IPRRSSV --  -31 338
#note I've lost all chance of winning at this point, so I take a gamble with this phony. Maybe I play L6 ERS for 27 if I see it.
>Margaret: AENOY G9 .YNE +18 361
#note Plays at 13C are best, like AYE

#note Thus ends a good lesson in humility.
