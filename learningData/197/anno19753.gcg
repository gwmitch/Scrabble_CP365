#note well that's ok, as long as i don't draw a disaster to HI or as long as he doesn't bingo again it's still anyone's game

#note -5, keep EHIT, i suppose good leaves are super important and bingoing early a must.

#note i get very fishy when down by so much. GONE is simming best but i really don't like keeping ELO and i don't even have the A. weird. maybe PENGO? WOOLEN looks gross too. no idea what to do here. EELY sims quite well too and i'd probably play it if i'd seen it. -4.5

#note i instantly challenged this because i thought it was only empyrean, for some reason, and because i had no shot i guess after this.
