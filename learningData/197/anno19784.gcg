#note I had to be out of there in half an hour at this point, since I had a bus to catch, and Eric agreed to play on my board despite preferring his, saying he was "doing me a solid". I don't have my racks recorded, as I played very fast, ending the game with more than 21 minutes on my clock.

#note I thought he had blocked a valid CARTFUL(S)*. It's not a word. Neither is this, but he didn't challenge. He was down to 8 minutes or so. FLAUT(AS) is fine, but I missed it. I needed to lay something down since my plan A was eliminated too quickly for a plan B.

#note he went over here, and missed RELOANS. I noted that (I had actually tracked correctly!) after he made his play. He looked kind of surprised.

#note I was in such a hurry to fill out the slip and slip out of the pub we were in that I didn't write down his 20 point loss from going over. I guess I did him a solid myself ;).

So yeah, fastplaying actually works. I might do this more often!
