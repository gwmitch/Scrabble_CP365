#note Burned time looking for bingos and then for 2x2s without considering that they weren't even worth it. G7 OHO is clearly better.

#note ALEURONIC is just the play I'm looking for. Maybe it's time to learn some nines. L3 CIS and 11H TIC are also among the top plays, to show how lousy my options are. ICING is a couple points back of ALEURONIC. I think it's fine, opening the board a bit.

#note I considered FAGIN for what looked like a much stronger equity play, but decided it wasn't worth it to open up the easy L column scoring line. I maybe misevaluated, since there aren't a ton of tiles that can hurt me too badly there, and since most plays there then opening up column M for bingos (which I need). The tricky F8 PILAFS is a point back of FAGIN (didn't see it) along with GIFT. PILAFS might be the best play against a lot of people, since GIFT and FAGIN make it so easy to kill the board. But Adam doesn't tend to do that until it's necessary.

#note Adam's been blitzing me as usual, so I end up rushing this play and missing the obviously superior VARIATE.

#note Outrunning is definitely better than trying to block. But I missed the better way to do it: N10 YE. That's going to cost me about 0.5% of a win since 1G dRACHMA and CHRIsMA now lead to a tie 1 in 3 times. It's very unlikely, but it's some lost win% nonetheless.
