>Craig_Rowland: COPTW 5D COWP.T +26 26
>Joshua_Sokol: ?OSTTVY F3 TO.Y +18 54
#note Is there any merit to playing J2 TOYS instead of this?
>Craig_Rowland: ABEMR G7 AMBER +23 49
>Joshua_Sokol: ??EQSTV J2 QuEST +49 103
#note QaTS is better. Was too occupied making one of the blanks a U.
>Craig_Rowland: OOP F10 POO +23 72
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEINRV H10 RAVINE +47 150
#note I like forgoing bingos when possible. This looks like a golden opportunity to do so since I also want to mask the fact that I have the second blank, since QuEST is an indicator of a second blank and I don't like giving rack information to my opponents. I could also just bingo. 47 is a lot though!
>Craig_Rowland: AIN K1 AIN +15 87
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADLNUZ 15B UNgLAZ.D +67 217
#note (A)ZANs might have slightly better equity but I don't think that's enough to play it over this board-tightening play.
>Craig_Rowland: EER 12H .EER +7 94
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEGIL K10 GA.LIC +18 235
#note perhaps I should just score well and leave well instead of blocking the most dangerous thing, and also, CAGIE(R) is much better than this.
>Craig_Rowland: ERSV 1K .VERS +36 130
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEETU O1 .AUTE +6 241
#note A weird turn. I think maybe I play D4 A(C)UTE. I like SAUTE's long term value though
>Craig_Rowland: AEMOOST D5 .OMATOSE +76 206
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEEHII I3 BI.E +28 269
>Craig_Rowland: GIL 8A GLI. +15 221
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHIRRU 15K .HIRR +42 311
#note CHIRU... Funny that a few games ago I chickened out of CHIRR when it was the best play and that this time CHIRR was there, I was 100% confident of it, and missed a better play. I didn't know CHURR, actually.
>Craig_Rowland: DD 13G D.D +14 235
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEOSUX B8 .UXE +27 338
#note played this so that he couldn't bingo twice and so I have a better rack for next turn.
>Craig_Rowland: AFIJNOU C13 JI. +20 255
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIOSU 14E EF +28 366
#note Saw that if I emptied with L9 FOES I would lose by two to THANKIN(G) A1. My math was off, I actually lose by 12. Anyways, not playing that.
>Craig_Rowland: AGHINOT 10A O. +9 264
#note He said he was fishing for EARTHIN(G)/HEARTIN(G) and INGATHE(R) but that isn't possible.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLOSU L9 KOIS +37 403
#note HANTING is there, I should play SULKIE(R).
>Craig_Rowland: ADGHINT 3B NIGH. +18 282
#note 50% was not on Craig's side as he misses HANTING. And this is how I win tournaments.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNU E7 EL +12 415
#note -3, I should play (K)UNE to block TAD. Crossed my mind that I should block but I didn't really care :/
>Craig_Rowland: ADT M8 TAD +17 299
>Craig_Rowland:  (NU) +4 303
