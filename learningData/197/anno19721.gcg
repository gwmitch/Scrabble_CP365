#note DAHL is 15 less but better on leave and defense. I didn't care about the leave because I didn't figure I'd bingo again, but I should've been more concerned about defense after the one tile play.

#note If I'm going to not be concerned about the G, ELL/LOCA is three better.

#note I did not know SENVY. I'm in a lot of trouble with an awful rack and multiple X hotspots that I can't block.
