#note Huge mistake here. It doesn't accomplish nothing, but I'm giving up lots of equity by not playing COVET at B6, I think I may have seen it but I didn't think but of it obviously. I could have thought it was too volatile, which may be true. Either way it's (-18)...

#note I lost a lot of equity on OCT(A)VES, but otherwise it was a solid effort I feel. Whiffing on TIDE was minor when I played DITE but not horrible.
