>JD: ?NNNRTY -NNNY +0 0
#note an interesting sim results with RTY? and NRTY? both overtaking RT?, even with opponent pass - bingo percentage is lower, but the bingos are worth more to make up for it.

#note I've updated my racks and I will leave commentary to a minimum :)

#note giving up a lot of points for an improved leave - BRRR is an intermediate option and GREET is the greedy one. I'm fine with this play

#note sid told me his rack but I forget
>JD: DINRSTV L12 V.ND +20 199
#note missed VINED for many more points, leave is fine w/many vowels left

#note with 4 Is remaining quackle massively prefers ILEX at 10K, and deservedly so.

#note I saw MEANIE, but it seemed like I could lose to an 80-point-ish bingo and then an out with two tiles, or to a bingo to the D. the downside of AE is that I give him an extra turn to fish after a bingo. In retrospect, I think I like MEANIE for max win percentage.
>Sid_Murali: AAEINTY 12G YA. +17 357
>JD: ADEEINR 14N NE +10 434
#note a simple improvement here would be to play NA to prevent 9s ending in -ER. on the other hand, I am up enough that playing TEE to outrun would probably win me the game no matter what he bingos with, but then maybe he could fish for a win.
>Sid_Murali: AEINOPT 10I .O +11 368
#note I should just play ANTIPODE
>JD: ADEEIRS 12L .IE +8 442
#note umm, this is the worst play ever. I was prepared to block PATIENTER but didn't even look for a bingo of my own (lol).
>Sid_Murali: AEINPTT G2 TAPE +18 386
#note unfortunately, the director, sid and I were all not aware of the rule change from this year that allowed sid to challenge after more than 20 seconds had passed...and so this play stayed.
