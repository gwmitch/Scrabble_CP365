>Matthew_Larocque: EEGNTXY 8G GEY +14 14
#note Thought about TEENY to set up the X, but I didn't like the chances of it staying open, nor keeping the G. Sim agrees.
>Mimmo_Rossi: NQRU H6 QU.RN +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: CEENTTX 10H .EXT +27 41
>Mimmo_Rossi: ELWY K8 WE.LY +22 36
>Matthew_Larocque: ACENORT 12H CRA.ON +28 69
#note Despite the high probability, this is not a bingo that has come up very much. I spent a few minutes here too. Also plays to the Y.
>Mimmo_Rossi: IKLP M9 PLI.K +28 64
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEOTW L4 ETWEE +24 93
>Mimmo_Rossi: AHO H12 .HAO +27 91
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINOP K1 ANOPIA +29 122
#note I liked how this got a lot of turnover and created forked hotspots.
>Mimmo_Rossi: NOV 1H NOV. +21 112
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIINV J5 AVE +34 156
>Mimmo_Rossi: ADLU M1 LAUD +16 128
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIIIIN -FIIII +0 156
#note Sim gives the edge to keeping EIN.
>Mimmo_Rossi: OZ 14F ZO. +32 160
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEIMN 15C BIMA +20 176
#note I struggled on this a lot. The simple BI(Z)E looks good. I also like AN(O)MIE to set up my B, there are few letters left that can take advantage of it. I probably would have chickened out on the word, though. BEMA also fares better, but there's a lot of Is left so I thought BIMA was better. The winner is BEE(PED) for 21, but I forgot about EAVE.
>Mimmo_Rossi: EFU 2F FEU +16 176
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGILN 3C GLEE +15 191
#note Missed G(H)EE - but I was hoping Mimmo did not know AGLEE and that I could use it to my advantage.
>Mimmo_Rossi: HII D1 HI.I +22 198
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFIINS 1A FIS. +30 221
#note INSIDE N10 is neat but dangerous with two blanks still waiting. But I supposed it is 42 points and sets up my F for big points next turn. If I had seen it in-game I'd probably end up going for it.
>Mimmo_Rossi: ACM 4F MAC +18 216
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEINS B3 aNISEED +64 285
#note The worst bingo, I looked from the F for a long time, the only word is FINESSED which I didn't really know. Missed some neat overlaps on the right. DEvEINS 85 would have been awesome.
>Mimmo_Rossi: DOOR A7 ODOR +29 245
>Matthew_Larocque: DGIJSTT 14J JIGS +40 325
#note Relieved that he didn't crush me with a big bingo on the TWS. And drawing 40 points here helped a lot.
>Mimmo_Rossi: ?AORSTU 11A SAnTOUR +68 313
#note Sim says he has a 45-46% chance to win if he holds off and plays 9J A(E) or 4A U(N). I might be forced to pass so he doesn't bingo out, if I can't block (which I can't if I don't have the I). I now just notice TURIONS would fit next to PLINKS.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDINRRT D9 BI.T +12 337
#note Wasn't 100% on BRITT, but this gets the job done.
>Mimmo_Rossi: TT 2M .TT +6 319
>Mimmo_Rossi:  (DNRR) +10 329
#note I figured there was no chance anyone could win a game with a lower score than this - but the results reveal that there was a game in the main event where neither player scored over 300. The game must have ended prematurely or something.
