#note really lost here, I need to either outrun, bingo back or try to block as much as possible. I considered A(T)RIA, (T)RIO, some other things, but I'm in trouble no matter what since I can lose without him bingoing. Decided to score as much as possible and retain a good leave for the pool.
>Roger_Cullman: ?AEISTV 14E AVIaTES +72 402
#note this is not right. Either Roger deson't bingo and plays VI(S)TA at 10J or he plays StATIVE at 14C. Those are much more likely to win than this.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFINOR 15H DINER +35 403
#note only this or 15G DRONE win. It took me a long time to find this. But also, I had completely screwed up the score and thought I was losing by two.
>Roger_Cullman: CEEMS M13 .MS +17 419
#note 8K C(I)ME(X) is the best play. This is 5 points back.
>Joshua_Sokol: FO J10 FO. +14 417

#note I didn't deserve this win. I missed ATHlETE and OUTDRAWN and DRASTIC and CARDITIS and bleh
