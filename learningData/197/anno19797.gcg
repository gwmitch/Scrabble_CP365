#note I really liked what this did to the board, immediately but also long-term. The problem is that I'm gambling with my leave, depending mostly on drawing a vowel. So I can totally understand the type of "play it safe" rationale that would go into playing something else, such as DICTU(M). Otherwise, playing ICTUS here was not something I considered, though I should have, but I don't think I would make that sort of play, even though it's early, since I'm giving John a great shot at taking an early lead. This way, after CU(M), he has a much less likely chance of getting the first bingo, and heck, he might even try CUMS*. Anyways, this was an interesting position, but I like my play best.

#note looked like there might be something in this rack. I did not know PARDAHS. It's an alternate spelling of PURDAHS, a word I did know. This was a big mistake, obviously.

#note Despite it setting up my S and blocking a prime lane, playing QA(I)D here seemed like the more dangerous option, given the counterplays that could arise from it on column L and given that I wouldn't really be using QAIDS for at least another turn, letting John score very well if he has the case S. Perhaps this was an oversight though. Leaving the P open doesn't seem like a great idea, now that I'm reviewing this position.

#note Not sure what to do here. So many threats exist on this board. I guess go for points for leave without opening something ridiculous... That's why I played this but AEIN really isn't that good here. Many other options seem decent here, K3 INANE being the best of the lot. I missed that. (I)NIA at 8L seems like it best addresses freak situations like SULFONE for 97...

#note John almost didn't play this, as it didn't look right to him, but he had SILENCED as well.

#note C8 (R)EB is champ's choice, but apparently this wins too. I guess (R)EB blocks most things. (V)OLUTiON is still available though, as are pONTOON, mOUFLON and FrONTON at O5. Going through endgames manually, it looks like I can win after any of those, but some of the endgames are tricky. I like just ending the game here, anyway. The best he can get to is a 13-point loss.
