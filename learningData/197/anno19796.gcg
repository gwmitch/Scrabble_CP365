>Tim_Weiss: DIKQRU 13A QUIRK.D +46 129
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACHNT 7H .ATCHmAN +66 120
#note I grossly underestimated the chance of me bingoing next turn after QAT. I should have played that or seen ACANTHA/ACANTHI.
>Tim_Weiss: EILOO O4 LOO.IE +21 150
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEIIPX E5 PIXIE +31 151
#note I missed two fine options here, PIE(R) and PEE(R)ED G8. I can see why I might want to play them. I still like my play but I shouldn't have missed those two.
>Tim_Weiss: LNOW K7 .LOWN +20 170
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEGHRY N9 REECHY +34 185
#note D10 E(N)E(R)GY was another miss. That is a fantastic play. 
>Tim_Weiss: AAGLMM N3 MAGM. +31 201
#note At least I know REECHY blocked a beautiful AMALG(A)M.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAGSUV 15A GUAVAS +59 244
>Tim_Weiss: ?ABLRTT D6 TAB +26 227
#note Joel took a very long while on this play. He seemed to be, from my perspective, trying to convince himself that I didn't have a huge counter. I really thought he held the Z here, or at least the P.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEOSVY C7 SOY +27 271
#note And because of that I made this paranoid play. I felt like I had a very good chance if he didn't bingo next turn. But I missed another great play, 5E (P)EAVEYS. That is many times better than my play; my largest mistake thus far this game.
>Tim_Weiss: ?EILRTT 5D s.LITTER +73 300
#note And I pay dearly for my mistake, as I should.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIOSV F2 VOI.E +23 294
>Tim_Weiss: AAEGIOT M2 TOGA +26 326
#note Joel insisted that he needed to play this, despite not having the Z, given the fruitfulness of the M column spot. I agree, I think.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIINS L2 ANE +23 317
#note 12K SAI(C)E is exactly what I'm looking for. Otherwise this is a good play.
>Tim_Weiss: DEINOPZ 3B EPIZ.ON +38 364
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIORSU J10 OURIE +18 335
#note Hoping he miraculously phonies or misses his outs.
>Tim_Weiss: ADNR B2 D.NAR +16 380
#note Overall a fantastic game. Too bad I couldn't capitalize on the many opportunities I had to make this an even closer game.
