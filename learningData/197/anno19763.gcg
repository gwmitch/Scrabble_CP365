>E_Tran: AAAEIOP -AAAIO +0 0
#note Very close with keep E or keep nothing.  It's a toss up.
>Jesse_D: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>E_Tran: EELNPWY 7H PLY +13 13
#note LY go together very well; Sim likes PEW PLEW or NEW.  7H PEW looks a lot better.  I was too infatuated with the parallel defense after PLY.  
>Jesse_D: ET J6 T.E +8 30
#note due to eric's tendency to play hyper-defensively, sims aren't very sueful here, I don't think. Quackle likes ET at 9H, but Eric is quite likely to block that up. by playing TYE I was hoping to fake holding the S for STYE, and therefore discourage Eric from sacrificing equity to block lanes.
>E_Tran: DEEHINW 9E WHINE +30 43
>Jesse_D: DEELRTT E8 D.ELT +18 48
#note I can hold the D for next turn also, but figured it was worth taking the points. I also open up a weak lane on column D, and if he scores on row 8 he will open up the board considerably.
>E_Tran: DEEEOSV 12A DEVO.EES +80 123
#note Lucky for this to hang in the perfect spot
>Jesse_D: BEIMMRT A6 BRIMME. +42 90
>E_Tran: ?AAINSU 5D UrANIAS +69 192
#note URANIAS best reduces the hotspots, despite what happens next.  Other options are IGUANAS or ANURIAS.  I stick with my play
>Jesse_D: DEGISTX 6E EX +51 141
#note I could also play EXITED from the E, but I blow through a lot of tiles and eric is likely just to overlap on row 7 or 9. 
>E_Tran: ANOORUY B2 UNARY +47 239
>Jesse_D: ?DGINST 13G DoTINGS +78 219
>Jesse_D: ?DGINST --  -78 141
#note AAARRGGGHHH. I didn't want to play TIDINGS because I wanted a lane on row 14, but didn't take the extra 30 seconds to find NIDGETS. Not only that, I had looked up this rack 3 days earlier and still messed this play up. X (   not only that but I had an unblockable bingo for next turn that I had drawn.
>E_Tran: CENOOOT 11H ONTO +10 249
#note My play is no where near the sim, even with inference.  I like it.  His only bingos will be poor ones at 2A.  Turns out his best plays would then be to forgo the bingo and make B11 DEIGN, ST(U)D or 10D D(E)IST.  Beyond immediate bingo defense, This play has some long term bingo defense properties as well.  Given the score, I just need to avoid Jesse bingoing multiple times.
>Jesse_D: ?DGINST 2A D.sTINGS +61 202
#note the situation may not be as bad as it seems - instead of taking the 60 point bingo on a dead board, I could easily hold the blank and either create the 3x3 on row 15 or just hope to draw a better bingo on row 13. DEIGN might not be an awful try.
>E_Tran: ACEEFOR 1H AFORE +33 282
#note Edges out OCREAE, my other consideration.  This does open up a dangerous spot at 2J, bu I liked the leave more.
>Jesse_D: EILOOVW 4F WOOL +28 230
#note creates a needed lane on row 3, although I supposed just WII creates ASKOI for the stealth lane
>E_Tran: ABCEKTZ D4 C.KE +34 316
>Jesse_D: AAEIOUV A1 I.EA +23 253
#note the sim prefers 4 vowel leaves over my stellar AOUV option...well, maybe I can understand that
>E_Tran: ABEHJTZ C7 HAJ +34 350
#note These last two plays score too much: I have to make them, instead of closing the board
>Jesse_D: AGNORUV C12 .AV +18 271
#note Jesse pined a lot before making this play, making me suspect he did not have the S.  (If he did, he would have played this more quickly and more assuredly)
>E_Tran: BDEILTZ 10K DITZ +37 387
#note This opens up a bingo lines, but again the pts make it worth while.  
>Jesse_D: CFGNORU 12K CURF +24 295
>E_Tran: AGIINOU 14C .AR +6 393
#note 4 tiles left.  I'm pretty sure I can't lose, but blocking line 15 looks best.  Champ says N12 FLAB is best.  Champ also suggests 2L ROB, which is fun.  I opt for defense.  Making a 3 tile play is most preferred, but I couldn't find one that blocked line 15.  With VAR, I like that I'm able hit a big play at 15D if he leaves that open.
>Jesse_D: I C7 ...I +14 309
#note fish for autoing
>E_Tran: BEGLOPT 15D BEGOT +42 435
#note Sim says PLOTZ to block all bingos.  BEGOT still always wins though.
>Jesse_D: AGINORU 14G GIAOUR +14 323
>E_Tran: LPS J1 .PS +11 446
#note STYES is 3 more.  I am still not 100% on which of STEY or STYE takes the S.  --The one that doesn't look like it does takes the S.
>Jesse_D: N 13B N. +4 327
