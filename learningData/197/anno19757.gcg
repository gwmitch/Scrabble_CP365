>Kolton: ?ACDEPR 8C sCRAPED +78 78
#note Kolton supplied his racks for this game.
>Noah: EIRRTTT H4 TITT.RER +59 59
#note I like having a closed board against Kolton but it just isn't happening here. Given that it's not a goal worth working toward, I figured this balanced opportunities the best of the two placements. I also played very quickly because I wasn't positive this was good -- TATTERER* is the phony.
>Kolton: ?DHMSTT 10G M.TH +17 95
>Noah: BGMSUWX K10 SWUM +28 87
>Kolton: ?ADKOST 12B DAKOiTS +84 179
>Noah: BBGISXY 13C XI +42 129
#note Maybe better to do BOXY or GABBY and go for the bingo as soon as possible since I'm obviously not bingoing with BBGSY next turn, though scoring points now and waiting a couple turns isn't bad, especially since Kolton isn't one to close down the board a lot, even with a big lead.
>Kolton: DEFOOQT 12J Q.OTED +36 215
#note Kolton thought maybe he should play QUOD; I like this one.
>Noah: BBGGRSY 5G B.GGY +24 153
>Kolton: AEEFOOS O6 SEAFOO. +33 248
>Noah: EEGIRSU 14A GIE +18 171
#note I overdrew and Kolton saw BEE, putting back the B.
>Kolton: EINNORV M7 INVEN.OR +82 330
>Noah: ACENRSU 7G U. +8 179
#note Missed AUXIN 13A which keeps a great leave and scores well. Great play here.
>Kolton: EEIIOPU -EIIOU +0 330
>Noah: ACENRRS 15G CRANERS +92 271
>Noah: ACENRRS --  -92 179
#note Wishful thinking. I'm pretty sure this is no good and hoping Kolton will make a word knowledge mistake, for while his word knowledge is very good it isn't airtight. Even if I get away with this it's still tough to win with this pool, so I may just want to go for SCARER 15C, giving up and maximizing spread. Not sure -- it's easy to have hindsight bias in these situations so I'm trying to avoid it.

#note The Y is nice but Kolton should probably just do YEA or BELAY.

>Noah: AEIOVWZ 3B ZO.AVE +38 339
#note This is really sloppy. The Z gives back so much and his options with this pool are otherwise so poor that I should just do VIM saving good Z plays.
