#note I think I should have just gone with BOOB for 30, because even though I'm taking the same points to block the triple-triple, I'm setting up either him or I for the easy extension. BOOB wins the sim by 6 equity points so I definitely call this a mistake, especially consider the ENT leave BOOB has.

#note My first thought was that this was a perfect scenario, because I could pull JINKED or something, but no E's out. Check out the remaining pool, it's wild. I also figured this was good because less turnover = less chance at the Q. DIF would be a good play also, but I think I was right to take the spot while it was there still. That's only really true because with the unseen pool it doesn't seem likely that he kills me on points on many places on the board.

#note Still being paranoid about the Q. JKNT + a Q could be a disaster with exchanging not possible.
