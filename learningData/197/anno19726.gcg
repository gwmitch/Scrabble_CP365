#note +20... I held this for over five minutes and ultimately challenged both words. I'm not good at quantitatively analyzing confidence levels and winning percentages in these situations, but I guessed that it was about a tossup if I didn't challenge, I would be a big but not huge dog if I added 20, and I would be a heavy favorite if it came off. I did know for sure that ELFS was not good in TWL, and since I didn't know otherwise in Collins I figured I had to challenge it. I felt like I might have seen ADIEUS, but I was unsure enough to want to risk another 10. For those who don't do Collins, ZEL is good, so the fact that he gets to draw six with the Z out also weighs heavily on this decision.

#note Not seeing 2B NATIVE for 40 is a killer here; I even looked at that spot on other turns, but forgot about it the one time it offered the clear best play. I probably wouldn't have challenged if I had seen it. Anyway, VENT was going to be the play if I hadn't challenged, guarding against the Z and hoping to grind out a win on a tight board, but now that I've dug a deeper hole I figured I had to go for the Z myself.

#note +10... I suppose I should just play this out, as there is at least a miniscule chance that I could get the Z and he's either blind to the ZEL spot or I can score a lot with it elsewhere.
