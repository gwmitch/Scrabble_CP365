#note Whoever wins this game gets 2nd place. Whoever loses gets nothing. Also, if I win, I pass Nigel in rating!
>Nigel_Peltier: MUY I8 YUM +22 22
>Kolton: AEEENOR G8 .EE +11 29
#note I drew a lot of E's in this tournament
>Nigel_Peltier: ADIOS 11C ADIOS +23 45
>Kolton: AEFNORR B9 FORERAN +81 110
#note This is a tough bingo to spot. I found it during Nigel's turn, and saw that I could hook AJEE and NO. It fit perfect. But then he hooks that S and my heart sank. I looked for awhile for other plays, then realized that ADIOS has a hook! ZOMG. I then considered playing it 2 spots up and praying that he doesn't know it's hoo(K), but chickened out.
>Nigel_Peltier: EGST J6 GEST +25 70
>Kolton: AEINOOP A12 PONE +44 154
#note I played PONE pretty quickly, then, while I was drawing, I thought that I missed EPINAOI. Oh no. wait. two O's. good. whew.
>Nigel_Peltier: DFN F10 F.ND +29 99
>Kolton: AEILOOS A7 LOO +14 168
#note Q likes LOOIE better in that spot
>Nigel_Peltier: NTW C10 W.NT +30 129
>Kolton: AEEEISY 5J EYE +18 186
#note Look at that, two more E's. 
>Nigel_Peltier: EEIMNST L5 .METINES +72 201
>Kolton: ACEGIQS B6 QI +33 219
#note I played QI, announced score, hit clock, reached my hand in the bag and drew 3 letters. Nigel flips them over.... IR?. Damn. I probably could've benefited from that blank.
>Nigel_Peltier: ELTV D8 VEL.T +44 245
#note Nice play
>Kolton: ACEGIRS M1 CIGAR +23 242
#note His played blocked C3 CAGIER. Darn.
>Nigel_Peltier: BIRTU C3 BRUIT +31 276
>Kolton: EIKRSTX 11K K.X +28 270
#note correct
>Nigel_Peltier: ABHLNO 2H HOBNA.L +36 312
>Kolton: AEIIRST 1C AIRIEST +91 361
#note Yay Satire.
>Nigel_Peltier: AIZ 10L .AZI +42 354
>Kolton: EHLORUW O8 WH.R +30 391
#note Out of the remaining tile pool, there are 2 blanks and a whole bunch of garbage. Championship player says O8 WH(I)RL wins 76.06% of the time. My play- 64.39%. I wanted to keep the L just in case I drew the G for GLAIRIEST. And I had the last E, so I thought that it could be quite valuable in the endgame.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?ACDGIU K11 .AGU +11 365
#note His rack was something very close to this. The other blank was in  the bag still.
>Kolton: AELOPUV 14I UV.LAE +34 425
#note My only chance is to play this and hope that he doesn't spot THE ONLY PLAYABLE BINGO
>Nigel_Peltier: ??ACDDI 4A CA.DIoiD +80 445
#note It took him a while, but he found it. A job well done. And an epic finish to a great game.
>Nigel_Peltier:  (OP) +8 453
