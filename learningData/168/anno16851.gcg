#note Is this a debatable placement? If so just make believe I placed it horizontally, then ask yourself the same question.
P.S I wouldn't have seen this (at least not instantly) if it weren't for having reviewed my top 2000 sevens for the first time. P.P.S it was stupid that I drew this.
>Jim_Brennan: EJO 6F JO.E +27 27
>Joshua_Sokol: BELSTTX G5 B.X +41 111
>Jim_Brennan: CRW 10F CR.W +15 42
>Joshua_Sokol: ELORSTT J9 SLOTTER +73 184
#note Firstly, I wasn't 100% on this word, secondly, I thought its only 100% valid anagram was LOTTERS, thirdly, I therefore keep forgetting SETLLOR! J6! Fourthly, I thought (D)OTTRELS kind of looked familiar but I also was unsure. Fifthly I'm way too lucky for this game. Sixthly if Jim 3x3ed here I still would be ahead most of the time which is ridiculous and the only thing closest to fair.
>Jim_Brennan: ?AORTUW 14F OUTW.ARs +62 104
#note Had Jim not drawn the W I would have been happy for him 3x3ing. 13G WAT(T)hOUR is extremely hard to find but is the best bingo available
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINNQS M12 QI. +22 206
>Jim_Brennan: AAFGHN 15A AFGHAN +53 157
#note Sick find! I held it because of my next rack.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNNS 5G ..NNI +16 222
#note F10 (C)ANN(ON) is really cool. Why in the hell did I not consider (BE)NNE in the same spot? That seems like an improvement given the pool and the G at C15. This was held
>Jim_Brennan: INOPTY 13A POINTY +28 185
#note Maybe H12 PI(T)Y? But I don't know his leave. It likely doesn't matter. 8F PY(R)O is interesting if Jim thinks he'll maybe draw an IN(G) word too
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRST L3 NASTIER +74 296
#note So yeah, did my subpar play matter? No...
>Jim_Brennan: EGY -  +0 185
#note Jim challenged NASTIER. (just kidding, BENNIS, which I wasn't 100% on either)
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADDEMO H12 DA.O +21 317
#note hm, maybe 7E DO(XI)E? DO(T)E? MO(T)E?
>Jim_Brennan: EGY M2 GEY +23 208
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEMRS D6 hERDSMA. +72 389
#note I looked briefly at N4, not enough to consider stuff making (AY)S instead of (AY)E, but I didn't continue considering the spot because of its relative volatility and looked at the N. Surprisingly this is the only thing that plays there.
>Jim_Brennan: EHO 8A HOE. +21 229
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIKMPU 10A UKE. +18 407
#note A second unfortunate event for me despite my fortune as Jim blocks the first cool play I would have made this game, UPKEE(P). My thought process here was to block some of lanes A and B (not many words end in H or O), score a little, not open the board a little, which PUKE C3 would do, but also keep a flexible leave that I can use to score if Jim tries to open something. I could have played (E)MEU 8L, as the floating U doesn't seem as threatening as column N.
>Jim_Brennan: LO B12 L.O. +14 243
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIMOP 15H .O.IE +16 423
#note E11 AI(T) seems like a good play as well
>Jim_Brennan: CNZ 7K Z.NC +16 259
#note This play took Jim the longest to make. I imagined that it was either because of a bad leave with an S or a leave without an S. It was the latter. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGIMP N4 EPI. +16 439
#note In any case I felt that it could be a good idea to play this, but it was probably too paranoid
>Jim_Brennan: ALUUV C2 UVULA +17 276
#note eww, UV draw according to Jim
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEFGMV 4A FA.VE +30 469
>Jim_Brennan: BEIST O7 SIB +31 307
#note B6 BI(O) is 3 points better
>Joshua_Sokol: DGM 2B M.G +12 481
#note I consider M(AYE)D being good but luckily I didn't shoot as Jim could have G stuck me if he knew what I had. Although he really had no time left
>Jim_Brennan: ET 2M .ET +8 315
#note 7A ET
>Jim_Brennan:  (D) +4 319
