#note A good starting word, though UNCOY may be better.
>Quackle: AACLLNN L5 AWA. +10 10
>New_Player_1: EIIIORT -IIO +0 30
#note TORII is probably a bit better.
>Quackle: ?AGLORS I3 GLAmO.RS +62 72
#note I think this was the play he made. 
>New_Player_1: EEIMPRT M1 EMPTIER +84 114
#note Best
>Quackle: EEGNNU 1G ENGENU. +27 99
#note Wasn't sure of it but I don't know his playing style well enough to know that this was phoney.
>New_Player_1: AAANNOR K4 ORA +18 132
#note Everything sucks here.

>New_Player_1: EEILORU H10 .EROLI +21 221
#note A tough choice, as he just exchanged 2 or 3 (can't remember) and was close to a bingo. I didn't like opening the board but I figured that he's going to bingo soon anyway.

>Quackle: EFINOST --  -76 155
>New_Player_1: AELPRTU 14F PU.L +12 233
#note NOTIFIES must be blocked. Quackle says dump the U but why should I let him get another chance to find the bingo?
>Quackle: EFINOST 15D FOE +14 169
#note SEveral better plays, including OF 35.
>New_Player_1: AEEERTT 2F ETA +9 242
#note For defensive purposes. The only good bingo lines are through the R on H12 and the L on I4.
>Quackle: AISTV 5E VIST. +16 185
#note VISCOUNTY is cool.
>New_Player_1: ACDEERT N5 AD +23 265
#note I think this is best, as I must keep the board closed. This eliminates plays like DECAF and DE.
>Quackle: DILW 3C WILD +19 204
>New_Player_1: ACEEERT 12D CATE. +14 279
#note To block off the last good bingo lane without opening anything else up. 
>Quackle: FOX 2B FOX +40 244
>New_Player_1: BDEEIIR 1A DIB +31 310
#note I thought this sealed the wins, by stoping a possible ZEES. I missed an importnat possibility though.
>Quackle: EMSS 4A MESS +47 291
#note Uh oh.
>New_Player_1: EEEIIRY 11E YE +26 336
#note Must block Za.

>New_Player_1: EEIR 2M .I +8 357
#note Missed BOWSE. I liked how this set up ERE for next turn. But since this is a spreadless tournament and I already won the game, I was less motivated to find the BP.
