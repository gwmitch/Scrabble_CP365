>Troy_Millington: IIIIIII -  +0 0
#note he actually passed...
>Curran_Eggertson: AADIOSW -WOA +0 0
#note So naturally I will exchange.
>Troy_Millington: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Curran_Eggertson: ADIRSTX 8H RADIX +42 42
#note best.
>Troy_Millington: CW I7 C.W +15 15
>Curran_Eggertson: DEFGSTT K7 F.DGET +22 64
#note Slightly better than GIFTED, probably the DWS.
>Troy_Millington: AN 7K .AN +16 31
>Curran_Eggertson: BJNOQST N6 JOB +35 99
#note JOT is more defensive, but need to keep that T for the Q.
>Troy_Millington: AAPRT O8 APART +36 67

>Troy_Millington: HIM 11E HIM +31 98
>Curran_Eggertson: EGMNSTU N10 ME +22 163
#note Miss NUTMEGS. Make an idiotic play instead. I thought too long about it.
>Troy_Millington: AEHV L11 HAVE +29 127
>Curran_Eggertson: AGNPSTU 15K UNTAP +36 199
#note obviously better than the real word here, UNAPT.
>Troy_Millington: Z N14 Z. +22 149
>Curran_Eggertson: DEEGOOS 12B DOGES +31 230
#note plenty of good moves here. This was not quite one of them. Best are DO(W)E(D) and GOOSE D8.
>Troy_Millington: OTY 13A TOY +25 174
>Curran_Eggertson: AELNORS 6L RA. +22 252
#note RAJ is close to LO(W)E(D).
>Troy_Millington: N B12 ..N +8 182
#note possibly not the best way to open the board considering the unseen pool of E's.
>Curran_Eggertson: EELNOSV 15A LEV +23 275
#note Lucky for Troy, I don't know my words. I don't know ELEVONS, but saw LEVO immediately after hitting my clock. LEV still puts me at 93%.
>Troy_Millington: D G9 D.. +8 190
#note not even opening anymore.
>Curran_Eggertson: EENOOSU D12 .OO +11 286
#note DOWED still pushing the top card. I will continue to ignore it. GOO a close second.
>Troy_Millington: OR 7G RO. +8 198
#note finally opening the board with a slough of 8 point turns.
>Curran_Eggertson: EEELNSU 6D LUNE +8 294
#note Exchange seems to win here. If he can bingo, take the good change of a counter bingo. If he can't I keep winning. LUNE is a surprise second after 1000 interations. I guess I'm smarter than I look. Still 93%.
>Troy_Millington: GLU D4 GU.L +10 208
>Curran_Eggertson: AEEEIIS -EEII +0 294
#note Thought keeping the A was best as it was the last one (and RAJA?). Keeping only S apparently correct. More turnover for the blanks, although I am beginning to think Troy has both of them.
>Troy_Millington: ENSY 8A YENS +31 239
>Curran_Eggertson: AEEFIST 7B FI. +15 309
#note Surprisingly, despite not seeing FIESTA for 41, FI(L) still destroys it by 6%.
>Troy_Millington: IL B5 LI.. +9 248
>Curran_Eggertson: AEEESTU C4 AE +8 317
#note Q still favours exchanging in hope of blanks, but at this point (knowing my opponent), I'm confident he has at least one of the blanks. Q still favours exchange when I specify he has a blank...
>Troy_Millington: C M5 C.. +5 253
>Curran_Eggertson: EEERSTU 4C ..UE +5 322
#note AGUE sims surprisingly high again, but falls to simply playing off one vowel in the bottom of the board at (TA)U for 3... I liked STEER, but Q puts that at 65% instead of 77%.
>Troy_Millington: ENW 3A NEW +24 277
>Curran_Eggertson: EEIIRST 4H RETIES +20 342
#note Q doesn't find it for some reason, but RETIES wins 94% again. Phew. I looked at unseens and didnt see any bingoes that started with a T. There are none.
>Troy_Millington: ??BIIKR 3I BI +16 293
#note Troy now has a 0% change of winning. His best move should be obvious, in column A...
>Curran_Eggertson: IIOO 3F OI +5 347
#note Troy has 6 seconds on his clock. His clock finishes in the final 10 seconds the majority of the time. I am not worried. Not only do I fail to consider his tiles... but i miss the extra 4 points for ION. (BI)O is best. IO(N) works. O(BE) also wins.
>Troy_Millington: ??IKR 2J KIRks +51 344
#note And with 1 second left, Troy places this. I do not immediately realise how many points it is, and I autochallenge. It is good, and I am still smiling when I come back to the board and realise that Troy has won by a single point. The catch is, his timer ended on one second. He did not designate his blanks in writing. I conciously did not hit his timer back for him to designate on his time. I immediately regretted this. I was only told at lunch that the director likely would have made a retroactive ruling to remove 5 seconds for not designating the blanks until after he neutralized the clock. Never again will I be a nice guy... but stellar endgame by a 1000 rated player... performed in 12 seconds.
