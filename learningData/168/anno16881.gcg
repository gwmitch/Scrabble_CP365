>Ross_Brown: AVV H7 VAV +18 18
#note So Ross is in second place and if he beats me he might eke in to first. I think he is the most threatening player in Ottawa's  and so I feel I need to play well this game. I really liked his opening play!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIILNU 9D DILU.IA +13 13
>Ross_Brown: CEIJNT K8 INJECT +42 60
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGINNU -  +0 13
#note I instachallenge this, because I saw DILU(V)IAN. I didn't play it because I was pretty damn sure EXUVIAN was invalid. Well, it is... But DILUVIAN is good! If my attitude wasn't one of my current attributes in tournaments, I would have raged so hard here! Instead I just kept repeating the same word in a happy way if that's possible. Shit!
>Ross_Brown: AFHLOTU F2 LOATHFU. +74 134
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGINNU -  +0 13
#note Instachallenged again! This was a psychological error, as I know LOATHFUL to be good. I wanted to hide in a corner after this! :'(
>Ross_Brown: EFOORR L3 REROOF +35 169
#note I regained control of myself though, and did not hold this 100% valid word
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGINNU 4A IGUAN. +16 29
#note 3I GUA(R)ANI? I want to maximize volatility here, as I know Ross isn't used to boards like these but maybe 8A UNAI is better, and even D7 AU(D)ING
>Ross_Brown: DEOW A1 DOW.E +27 196
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEMNY 5C MEA.Y +30 59
#note M3 ENEMY scores enough to merit a partial board shutdown I think? 8A MAYA is also a better play I'd say
>Ross_Brown: OZ 12K .OZ +28 224
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNOSS M11 A.ON +26 85
#note 13J E(T)NAS is interesting, but I prefer forking. I'm only winning one in 50 times anyway.
>Ross_Brown: DET M4 TED +11 235
#note weird. I guess he was trying to block the N lane
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIKNSS 15I KINESES +100 185
#note Oh boy oh boy I should of played ENSKIES because of this game cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=15727#20. I was kind of afraid after TED of him bingoing back but I really can't be in my position I think, which is why I played KINESES here. I think it's between ENSKIES and KINESES where I placed it, although I inferred a blank from Ross
>Ross_Brown: Q J14 Q. +31 266
>Joshua_Sokol: EGILPSX G1 PIX +39 224
#note I think so? Maybe D9 (D)IPLEX, K4 GIP/PIG? This play could turn sour I guess
>Ross_Brown: ??LRSTW O8 SWeLTeR. +80 346
#note N6 SWeLTRy. I didn't know it (either?)
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEGHLS 8A HEBE +34 258
#note GHEE instead? I'm back to only winning one in 50 iterations :(
>Ross_Brown: CEEINNT B8 .NCEINTE +82 428
#note Alrighty then, gg Ross :P
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGLSTU H11 TEGUA +57 315
#note I drew an A and magically noticed this possibility. I think it could be good and that Ross probably won't challenge. I knew AKINETIC was good. Not AKINESIS* though, whatevs, if he challenges and it's good I may have a chance...
>Ross_Brown: AOP H1 APO +42 470
#note yup, gg
>Joshua_Sokol: BDGILRS 15A B.RG +27 342
#note I lose 9 points in this endgame if Ross makes the best play next turn. I only lost 5 instead. B(E)GIRD is the play. 
>Ross_Brown: AIMORRY K2 MAYOR +38 508
#note RARI(T)Y blocks my outs
>Joshua_Sokol: DILS E12 LIDS +13 355
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IR) +4 359
#note Very embarrassing loss, but at least I got away with AKINESES* and didn't play badly after the first 2 turns!
