>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIIIV -AEIIIV +0 0
#note Finally a bad draw
>Deen_Hergott: AFORV H4 FAVOR +30 30
>Joshua_Sokol: AEQRSWZ G7 WAR +22 22
#note Should I exchange again? Should I play WA(V)ER and set my Z up? heh...
>Deen_Hergott: AEMT F7 TEAM +23 53
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEQSTZ 5G Q.T +12 34
#note Do I burn my Z, my S and my Z? I preferred setting up ZEDS for 47 and maybe drawing into DIS(FAVOR) sometime soon. A sim puts I3 ZED and 5G Q(A)T very close, possible becaust of the possibility of drawing QAT J2 or Q(AD)IS G5
>Deen_Hergott: FGLNU E8 FLUNG +32 85
#note ouch, nice play
>Joshua_Sokol: BDELNSZ J2 ZEDS +47 81
>Deen_Hergott: AAEP 12D A.APE +18 103
#note aww, don't ruin your defense, Deen! :(
>Joshua_Sokol: BDELLNT 3I B.LLED +24 105
#note I didn't know BL(E)NDE and how is bellend not a word :(
>Deen_Hergott: AELO 4L OLEA +19 122
>Joshua_Sokol: HINOOTW 11H NOHOW +24 129
#note There are a lot of candidates for this play and I really can't figure out which one is the best. I noticed that a larger problem with my play is that there are 8 I's unseen, but that otherwise it would be the clear-cut choice. OLEA infers Deen wasn't worried about that factor, maybe because he didn't pay attention to the pool or more likely because he didn't have an I. This makes NOHOW pretty dangerous. Both WINO plays, 13F and 11H, look like better options if I think I should be worried about the I situation. 2M TOW looks like an alright play because of a leave that can score. This move doesn't seem that pivotal but I think it kind of is. If I were to go back in time I believe I would play 13F WINO. 
>Deen_Hergott: JNU 10I JUN +30 152
>Joshua_Sokol: IIIRTTT 13F TITI +16 145
#note There go the I's. I think exchaging TITII is also a decent option.
>Deen_Hergott: IIIII -IIIII +0 152
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IIORST O4 .ORISTIc +71 216
#note So I saw m(EL)IORIST but was unsure of its validity, and then I saw this but didn't really like it because of it giving up that tasty X spot. The only playable 7 is SORITIc, a word I wouldn't challenge nor would I play until knowing its validity now. The most interesting and maybe best play is another 9, SI(DE)ROTIc, which means "containing too much iron". Cool! Deen held this as he was almost sure that it was good but he hadn't seen the word in a while. 12K TORII is also an option here.
>Deen_Hergott: ACEI 10A AECI.. +12 164
#note scored as 13
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGIMOR A8 IM.GO +27 243
#note The only thing I saw here was GLO(A)MIER* and I didn't like it. Deen thought it could be good but that he would still challenge. I have to stop missing stuff like IdEOGR(A)M. In any case, the other playable bingo is really really awesome. Find it!
>Deen_Hergott: PUY B12 YUP +21 185
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIORT C3 mETEORI. +72 315
#note I finally saw this after a while. Good thing I didn't miss 2 good opportunities in a row. I'm still afraid of the X, so even before seeing this I considered dropping the O at N10. But YUP infers no X most of the time and he drew 3 out of a lot... Also nEOTERI(C), ExOTERI(C) and EsOTERI(C)
>Deen_Hergott: EX N9 EX +52 237
#note well at least there's that for Deen
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIKNRU 14I DUKING +31 346
#note B2 DURING looks promising! I missed it. I think this has to outrun unless I draw maybe one or two terrible combinations...
>Deen_Hergott: ABOSS D1 BOAS +23 260
#note I like it
>Joshua_Sokol: ACHNRVY 1D .RANCH +39 385
#note So I thought there was a U in the bag somewhere and that I had just mistracked the E's. But there is really nothing that 3x3s through the B. I didn't want to waste time and also wanted to play it safe here, but I really should have gone with my previous candidate play of 13C HAY.
>Deen_Hergott: DEEEINS 15D DIENES +31 291
#note DIS(BRANCH)! Deen was running low on time so he didn't figure out that he could get more spread by blocking my two outplays with E4 SEE or E1 (R)INSE. Deen therefore lost 26 points in this endgame
>Joshua_Sokol: RVY 6B V.RY +18 403
>Joshua_Sokol:  (E) +2 405
#note This was the game in which I was the most distracted. I don't know why, and I need to learn to keep my focus even though I'm improving in that regard. Things were looking grim until I drew that first blank, and I'm lucky he didn't have anything for a long while.
