#note Burned a lot of time looking for eights with all those through tiles. Nothing, though. And as usual, I too annoyed to put a lot of thought into the best nonbingo. CLOMB is fine, I think, for being annoying for bingos. If I can make a parallel to ELA next turn, the board gets pretty tight. But the hot spot next to the O is worrisome. Maybe MOBILE is the play. That's Quackle's sim winner.

#note Wanted to block rows 1 and 2 this turn if possible. But I1 TIE seemed a little too much to give up

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EENOORT 1L TOON +22 198
#note Played this turn too quickly. Thought taking the spot was obvious, but 6J OE is really strong. It's not a huge error.

#note Didn't like seeing him turn over 6 into two unseen blanks. I had to hope that he couldn't bingo without giving a line back. So FLINDER kind of ensures that. One problem though: bag is a bit vowelly, so FIELDER, maybe.
