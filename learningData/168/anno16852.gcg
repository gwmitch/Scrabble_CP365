>Chris_ten_Den: NQRU L9 QU.RN +28 97
>Joshua_Sokol: AINNSST 14F SANNITS +76 184
#note I played this as if it were good because I thought it was good. Confused with SENNITS.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEOOUYY 13G YO +24 208
#note I saw no reason to exchange here but maybe if he bingos with MIAOUS I'm in trouble. Exchanging could be the right thing to do

#note nice friggin draw
>Chris_ten_Den: HIK -  +0 143

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEGOR 12I AE +10 271
#note I took too long to play this and it may not be right either. GEA(R) and GOE(R) seem decent
>Chris_ten_Den: EFL O13 ELF +25 205
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGIORR 4I GORIE. +14 285
#note RIGO(R), same spot maybe. M5 OR if I don't feel the need to be aggressive

#note Chris hesitated on this play after laying this down. I was unsure why but forgot to ask
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACDEIL 4A CLArIED +80 375
#note RADICLE RADICEL CLARIED! I just studied that! Except that I already confused the triplet with CLARIES ECLAIRS SCALIER. Jesus. I am so lucky he didn't challenge.
>Chris_ten_Den: VW C3 V.W +18 294
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGGIXZ A4 .IG +6 381
#note Finally something relatively difficult as I struggled for almost ten minutes before figuring out what I thought I should do. I still had 3 more minutes to think and I think I should have used them, as this only wins by 9 if we both play the endgame correctly, compared to Z(AG), which I considered, that wins by around 40. I wanted to block POACHED and stuff and any freak out bingo that I could.
>Chris_ten_Den: ADEHOPR A4 ...AR +24 318
#note Chris didn't really track well and he didn't realize that he might have still had a shot. I thought he was setting up his HOPED out At E2.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGXZ 7A .DZE +24 405
#note 5F DEX. I don't know why I didn't try to block the out I thought he had seen
>Chris_ten_Den: DEHOP D7 .H +9 327
#note Chris confused himself here, cause he said he saw his out, but then thought about if he could X stick me after tracking, and when he realized he couldn't, he still decided to play this and forgot about going out
>Joshua_Sokol: GX L3 ..X +20 425
#note I should block with I2 G(AG). -21 :(
>Chris_ten_Den: DEOP 2E DOPE +23 350
#note -5 to OPED
>Chris_ten_Den:  (G) +4 354
#note This game was a clusterfuck of stupid mistakes by me that would have cost me any game against top players.
