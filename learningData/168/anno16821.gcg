>brett: DDEEMN 8D MENDED +26 26
#note i actually went first in this game and exchanged, but i dont remember what it was i traded.
>xp: ACEHRST E3 TEACH.RS +76 76
#note a flat out whiff. RECH(E)ATS for 102, RATCHES C3 for 95, RACHETS C7 for 93, RATCHES C7 for 89, CHASTER C3 for 89, etc., etc., etc. it was the last game of the day and watching the Seahawks game at the bar was more appealing to me than playing scrabble.
>brett: CEGNORR 4A CONG.RER +80 106
#note phony. total garbage. we are both 8-7 and at Table 8 for a reason. i spent so much time at Table 8 in this tournament that the Hyatt Regency billed me for it.
>xp: ?AEELNR A4 .LEANERs +77 153
#note obviously i let CONG(E)RER* go so that i could then whiff on four 3x3s and two other high scoring bingos. someone get me a beer, and do it quickly.
>brett: ADEMRTU 3G MATURED +87 193
#note the star play here is c3 U(N)DREAMT/AMENDED for 91, but Brett was OK with this.
>xp: FORSSYY 4L FOY +31 184
#note FOYS is better than FOY according to the duck. i didnt play FOYS because i couldnt remember if it took an S, and neither could he for that matter. yes, i cant remember my 4s. damn we are smooth. that beer is gonna taste really good after this, let me tell you ...
>brett: FOP B3 P.OF +32 225
#note POOF! there it is! POOF! there it is!
>xp: LPQSSXY 2B SPY +36 220
#note hey i did something right! its easy to make good plays when you have, like, 1 of them, although S(POOF)Y wouldve been worth a bunch of style pts. 
>brett: EO C1 O.E. +20 245
#note this would explain where all the vowels are.
>xp: ALQRSTX 2H LAX +56 276
#note aah, vowel, sweet vowel. where have you been?
>brett: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 245
#note i dont know what Brett's rack was when he exchanged, but there are 9 unseen I's so i just went ahead and assumed the worst.
>xp: AGNQRST 1G QAT +51 327
#note note these many opportunities to play QATS for 53 using the FOYS hook i cannot remember.
>brett: GIIKNV 10E .KIVING +27 272
#note come to think of it, Brett said he kept an I when he played this, so maybe his last rack was IIIIIIU instead.
>xp: GIINRSU K5 URGIN. +16 343
#note complete whiff on (C)RUISING. i am going to attribute this miss to being distracted, however, as a guy at the table to my left was being a jerkstore as he whined about his tiles, and was verging on being verbally abusive to his opponent in the process, and i am glad that i didnt have to play that  obnoxious boor in this tourney, because if i had, it wouldnt have ended well. we all get frustrated, me more than most, and i know i can be a lout when its going bad, but he was crossing the line and had it continued, i wouldve called the director on him. in retrospect, i shouldve. anyway, i missed another bingo. go me.
>brett: OW H10 .OW +13 285
#note its not going so well for Brett.
>xp: INOSTTV 12F VO. +9 352
#note i played VOW because he played VOW. hell, we're 2 guys who are 8-7 and playing at Table 8. why not have some fun? my equity loss in this game is now larger than the national debt. i actually played some great, near perfect losses in this tourney. i played far better in my losses than my wins, in fact. i find little connection between playing well and winning. i find little connection between playing well and anything, to be honest.
>brett: I G12 .I +3 288
#note like i said, its not going so well for Brett.
>xp: AHINSST C6 SHANTIS +82 434
#note there was actually some method to the madness on this one. yeah, it scores 94 at O4, but this gives me 82 and doesnt give him any comeback options, since he needs two big plays after this and one now would have to involve using the blank for an S to make a hook on FOY that neither of us can remember.
>brett: ?DEILOT -  +0 288
#note desperation challenge from Brett. there is a story behind how no one from SF95 could ever miss SHANTIS ever, but i will save that for another time.
>xp: AEIOUWZ 2M AZO +28 462
#note i care less about finding a good Z play and more about the fact that the Z-Hawks are down 10-3 to the 49ers.
>brett: ?DEILOT 14E DELTOId +64 352
#note i was glad Brett got one back here. i hate beating up on my friends. i like beating them, of course, but this game got out of hand owing nothing to my ability, because i have none, and owing entirely to luck.
>xp: BEEIIUW A1 WE +24 486
#note cheap and easy points
>brett: ABEIIJU 15B JIBE +19 371
#note clearly the best strategy is to go out in two and go straight to the bar, although Brett loses style pts. for not playing JABI(R)U.
>xp: ABEILTU 13J BEAUT +19 505
#note BLITE BLEAT and BLATE are better. this is far and away the worst game of scrabble i have played in quite a while. i would take a badly played win like this over a well played loss anytime. the objective is to win and i make no apologies for doing so, even if i played like an imbecile.
>brett: AIU 9J U.AI +7 378
#note thats all folks! lets go to the bar!
>brett:  (IL) +4 382
