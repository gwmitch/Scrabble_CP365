#note maybe a missed chance here, if I play XI I set up BLIN for next turn (although she is quite likely to play there)
>Maureen_Morris: EMOR 10I MORE +21 283
#note in this case I really cost myself by not playing xi last time since she didn't play on row 2
>JD: BBIILNT 1D BLIT. +19 281
#note KIBBI for 26 looks really good, she can hurt me by playing there but then I am very likely to score on row 2.
>Maureen_Morris: NU 9I UN +15 298
>JD: BFFHINO 13K OFF +23 304
#note I screwed up here because I chickened out of MUCHO, which would set up IFF next turn. also missed LAVASH. this is wayyyy worse
>Maureen_Morris: AE 12M AE +12 310
>JD: BEHINUU L13 .UB +11 315
#note I was really low on time at this point - the best play is UNSPOOLED for good points. I was hoping that this would serve as a decoy - she can't score much here, and if she does empty the bag I should be able to out-in-two and win. I was also hoping to draw the R or the S so I could play at row 2G.
>Maureen_Morris: AO 15K A.O +5 315
>JD: EEHINRU 2G H.REE +33 348
#note I was in a lot of time pressure, so drawing the R was a huge break. but actually, playing here is not right - I should be scared of her playing JET at N1 to set up the case O, so the play is HI at N3. still, this is good enough.
