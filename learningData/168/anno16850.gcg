>Joshua_Sokol: EGHIOQT H7 Q.T +12 12
#note So I immediately see that static likes (C)HIGOE and EIGHT(V)O, as well as GOTHI(C) before Q(A)T. He took longer than usual to play VAC so I imagined he didn't have an S, which is why I decided to go with this. A 3-ply sim puts Q(A)T well ahead of other candidate plays except exchange GIOQ, which may be a good idea.
>Dean_Porporo: CDIS 10F DISC +24 40
#note darn, an S.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGHILO J9 HOG +19 31
#note I3 GEODI(C) is new and interesting

>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILNO 11A ELOINED +72 103
#note nice draw for me
>Dean_Porporo: ?AEHNTX A11 .XpAT +57 120
#note Actual rack. XAnTHEN(E), L9 NArTHEX, A6 EXHAl(E)NT, A10 H(E)XANE and some other stuff are better than this

#note this scared the hell out of me
>Joshua_Sokol: AAILNRS 5E LANIAR.S +68 307
#note I looked so long to make sure I wasn't missing anything starting in T or through (ER), even if it was just an 8. I wanted to get rid of the huge threat that was staring me in the face
>Dean_Porporo: FGU L2 FUG. +16 250
>Joshua_Sokol: AFLMOSW 15I FLOW..S +51 358
#note The sim results are skewed quite in my disfavor here as I am very confident Dean wouldn't spot any FLOWERS extensions and that I would, as he was already running pretty low on time and seemed desperate to bingo. He isn't going to be looking at extensions.
>Dean_Porporo: GIW 6D WIG +20 270
>Joshua_Sokol: AEMNOOT M3 MO +19 377
#note Unfortunately, even though I wanted to spot FLOWERS extensions, I missed my first opportunity to get one. Next time I decide to play FLOWER or FLOWERS I should know all of the extensions instead of less than half. 
>Dean_Porporo: ?AEEENP K1 AE +7 277
>Joshua_Sokol: ABENOPT N2 OPT +21 398
#note I also didn't know the 2-letter FLOWERS extensions, one of which I missed this time. 
>Dean_Porporo: ?AEEPRT 14E PREhEAT +73 350
#note EARThPE(A)! I was sad he managed to bingo
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEINN H1 BIND. +30 428
#note I still have DEFLOWERS. Now I understand the simulation's slant toward WOLF(ER)S. 13F ABED is one point better, and maybe he would have challenged INDAB(A)
