#note Hey, my choice comes out top on Quackle's sim for win% and equity. Thought it might have been one of those rash decisions I sometimes make

#note The bingo is clearly best, though Quackle is somewhat tempted by DIT or DID M15. With such a horrible unseen pool, and a canny opponent, that strategy is unlikely to pay off
