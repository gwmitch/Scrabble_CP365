#note poor start to this game as I completely whiff on the fact that dairy is a word. I saw beedi right after I hit my clock, but actually bio at E11 is not much wore - the DDEE leave looks wrong but bingos more than DO.

#note hover for 10 extra is too much to pass up

#note zoochore is pretty awesome, but I should play COHO for the 4 extra points

#note really bad miss, the zoo- extensions never occured to me. zooecia for sure.

#note completely missed thwarter from the T for 86. more importantly, I thought of playing trawler here but passed it up - he scores 9 points more per turn after waterer, so this was an error that I regretted immediately

#note SARINS sims best of any play that comes up on generate choices, but actually I missed a beautifully opportunity to set myself up here: Playing TOSS at H2 to set up STOSS. He is unlikely to know that STOSS is good, although it would definitely look like a setup. Even so, the resulting complexity (he might sacrifice points to block on row 2, for instance) makes it a good decision, I think. Problem is, I'd forgotten it was a word...STOSS - facing the direction from which a glacier moves (adj.) so no STOSSES# (it is good in csw).

#note the M seemed very useful in a bag full of 1-pointers.
>Will_Scott: OOT M1 OOT +14 333
>JD: AEEEMPS N1 EME +29 321
#note with that blank unseen, every flipped over tile counts, so quackle likes EPEE for the extra 2 points, and the M is just a better tile than the P.
>Will_Scott: AEGGNNT 9A NEG +11 344
#note this is a great play by Will (this is his actual rack) - he had the second G, so it sets up a great lane for him if he can just draw one of the Is or the blank. He bingoes 34% of the time versus 20% if he plays NAGGY at 15D leaving ENT.
>JD: AELNPSU O8 .PANSULE +83 404
#note with my actual rack of AELNPSU, I felt like I was in good shape, but in reality Will had a 44% chance of drawing a bingo that hits column A after his last play. I might be able to lose here by getting Q stuck as well, so this is effectively a coin flip.
>Will_Scott: ?AGILNT A3 TANGLI.g +77 421
#note credit to will for making a great opening on his previous move, he deserved the win.
