#note Watch as I almost lose to Danny again
>E_Tran: ABDMPUU E5 PUMA +28 28
#note worth the risk?  I thought there was a small chance this was good.  But, might be a dumb spot to phony.
>Danny_P: ILQT 6D Q.ILT +16 38
#note Danny said part of the reason he let it go was that it gave him a Q play
>E_Tran: BDEFGSU I3 FUBS +28 56
#note BUDGET you fool.  FUGS is also better, since Gs suck

#note H1 GAEN.  uggh.  Fishing with (K)A is also genious.  I'm definitely not playing my best.

#note I have a Y for OXY, but can't use it.  I thought of just DE(V), but what of his last play?  Normally, playing AR means a bingoish rack.  also, he didn't play at 10F last turn, so maybe he doesn't have one of the billion O's in the bag.  But, these inferences mean less since Danny is low rated, and could have done AR(F) with anything.  DE(V) is probably okay here.  or even CYDER to go for blanks and block the 10F spot

>E_Tran: DEEPRVY 5L PRY +33 175
#note kinda torn here.  NERVED opens the board.  I'm behind, so that's good for me.  But the board sucks for him after I play PRY, I might be able to sneakily catch up.

#note This is a pretty bad play.  The bag is already vowel heavy -- why on earth keep two vowels.  I mostly play this to turn over 5 tiles for the blank, and mess up the VOICE-hook.  I'm taking the turnover concept too far here; I really do need a better leave.

>E_Tran: ?EIIIOR O8 .ORII +6 279
#note Points are at a premium, so I thought taking the 6 pts would be worthwhile.  Really, if I fill the pool with I's, I should be in good shape.  It also leaves me with 2 bingo lines for my blank.
>Danny_P: LOUW 15D WOUL. +13 295
>E_Tran: ?AEHIIL 7L AH +20 299
#note No good way to use NORIA.  sucks.  Sim likes 14A ILIA.  Which is brilliant.  If he does hit WAIN or WAIT, I have bingo potential.
