#note Quackle slightly prefers the G on the DLS to the D, although I'm not sure I understand why.  Possibly because having the G on the double-double line threatens fewer bingos there than the A does?

#note For most of this tournament starting right here I recorded how much time I had left after each play to see how long it took for me to handle certain situations, so I'll put that in the comments when available.

#note Quackle prefers PAW in the same spot and F13 UP.  I definitely don't.  UP basically shuts down the bottom left quadrant and PAW opens up a triple line he'll very likely take while offering me nothing in return.  I also prefer the PTU? leave after WAG and think I'm more likely to bingo somewhere after that since I'm creating two lines while not blocking others.  I do not believe this is an error.

#note My first major error in the game (loss of 12.25% in winning percentage).  I didn't see OPAQUES, but interestingly COUP actually simmed better and I can understand why.  I should have at least seen that.

#note SLURBAN apparently makes it easier for me to come back since it sims slightly better and I sort of know that, but not well enough to automatically think of it.

#note Saw REVET but chickened out.  It didn't particularly matter at this point though.  Still, this is much, much better than I usually play, but the errors are still fatal.  Might have been able to actually beat him had I bingoed earlier.

Cumulative winning percentage loss via Quackle: 25.5%
Average winning percentage loss: 2.3%
Significant mistakes (3): REP (word-finding error/strategy error), OM (word-finding error), EVE (word knowledge error)

Anyway, I played this much better than usual strategically - just continued to not see things.
