#note (T)REND is an interesting play.  REDD(S)is acceptable.  keeping just DER? is also preferred.

#note Looked best for closing the topleft.

>E_Tran: AEGNOOT 15D GENOA +35 180
#note I think ODONATE may be better here.  Kills both x3 lanes, and the board is pretty dead after that.  The bag is also vowel heavy.  Sim still prefers GENOA.

#note With only 1 S left, I considered TAO N11.  But the leave is so bad, it'd be hard to capitalize on the spot even if it stayed open

#note Oh my.  OUTWHIRLS.  good chance it draws a challenge, too!  Need to pay more attention to extensions.  Now seems like a good time to try TAO.

#note I'm pretty happy with this sequence.  I score well, and have an unblockable x3 spot.  FABS or QATS there should be enough for me to catch up and win this.

#note Saw the pool had no 7s.  Wasn't 100% on ROUP.  No point risking the game on it here.
