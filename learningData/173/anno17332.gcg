>Josh: BDDGIOX H5 OXID +24 24
#note notice how I went first in all of the club tourney games! I think I should have considered GOX of BOX here. This was a strange play, but I like it.
>Wapnick: EFU 9G FEU +24 24
>Josh: ABDGHNN G5 BAH +34 58
>Wapnick: BDIR J6 BIRD +21 45
>Josh: DGINNOP 8J .OPING +36 94
>Wapnick: EIMOSST 10B SOMITES +82 127
#note MITOSES is 4 more points.
>Josh: ADFINUY F6 FAY +44 138
#note Are you seeing why my placement of OXID was really cool yet? Joel wasn't.
>Wapnick: EGLSTW M7 W.GLETS +34 161
>Josh: DEEIKNU -  +0 138
#note I really didn't like that word, thought it was Collins only, but I remember now that I knew it was good at some point.
>Wapnick: EERT 11C RETE +20 181
#note ajsiodsa;fhudsufisdhfisud;fhsdfs he played TE# and I missed it... He said he had another T here, in which case maybe not challenging saved me from something. Do you see what yet?
>Josh: DEEIKNU K4 UKE +18 156
#note 8A DINKE(Y). This just keeps getting worse and worse. 9B UKE is 13 more points. 8A KIDNE(Y) is there if I don't know/miss DINKE(Y). This play was just slapped down in frustration. Ridiculously bad...
>Wapnick: ACEHLOT B3 CHOLATE. +65 246
>Josh: DEIINOY 12G IDONEI.Y +78 234
#note Joel first puts this at F13. When I drew IOY I was visibly flustered, but when I saw what he was about to block I was ready to RAGE!!! But Joel makes the right move, and lets me dumb the crap I drew
>Wapnick: ?AAESTW 13A SEAWAnT +73 319
#note Not that it matters? He had 3G WATApES as Emanuel pointed out right after he made this play
>Josh: AENRRTV 7A V.R +7 241
#note this has to be right...
>Wapnick: CINOV 3K COVIN +30 349
#note Wapnick playing some D! Nice!
>Josh: AAENRRT A7 .AR +26 267
#note lol...
>Wapnick: AENQU D4 QUEAN +37 386
#note more D by the Pro-fessor :)
>Josh: AEIINRT E2 RAIN +23 290
#note this time it actually blocked something
>Wapnick: GJU 1C JUG +18 404
#note And somehow, Joel's playing defense (he hesitated to play this rather than score at O1) TOTALLY backfired. This is the WORST thing you can put at C1!
>Josh: ?ADEIMT 1A aD...ATE +144 434
>Josh: ?ADEIMT --  -144 290
#note But even worse! Even when I knew he had granted me a chance of winning, I pull off the chokiest choke by playing this! What in the hell was I thinking? Instachallenged off!
>Wapnick: EORZ O1 ZO.ER +45 449
>Josh: ?ADEIMT 1A bI...ATE +135 425
#note I play the correct word this time, but it's too late
>Wapnick: LLNOP 11I LOP +22 471
#note 11K PL(E)ON for 9 more points in the endgame.
>Josh: DM L2 D.M +20 445
#note N2 M(I)D for 3 more for me. What a ridiculous game. I think I played worse than Joel but we both choked massively! he had TETR(OXIDES) earlier, too...
>Josh:  (LN) +4 449
