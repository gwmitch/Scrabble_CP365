#note I noticed that WAX set up some ADZ plys right after I had set down the Z, but by then it was too late to think about that. Q says ZAX is still best.

#note For this situation (close game), this is a terrible rack to draw. I can't score points and basically *have* to fish. This sucks. T(HE)GN is a better play than his. DRAG L9 is also beter. 
>Robin_Lewis: IILP M1 PILI +23 305
>Matt_Canik: INPRSTT 5A PINTS +34 322
#note T(I)P 2L is an interesting fish. I think that's a better play here. (HE)T allows a bingo with any vowel pull except I, and also S. 

Sort of a fan of taking the non-volatile option here and just tryng to in an endgame. But TIP is intriguing.

#note I should kill her best bingo line along the 9 row. This does that. 
>Robin_Lewis: OY 11G OY +12 342
>Matt_Canik: LRTUUVY 9K .VY +13 402
#note My thinking is this: if she has BARONESS she has BARONESS, but I'm trying to disrupt any bingos starting in an S down the M and N rows. Q wants me to play LUV for 6, but it can't make inferences about her rack. 

(B)URY is also an option- empties the bag so she has no chances to fish, but loses to bingos along 9 and M.
