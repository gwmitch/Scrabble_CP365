>Sean_Wrona: EEIPTTY 3K YET +20 52
#note I like this better than the other and slightly higher-simming YET because it opens two additional bingo lines on a board she'd be extremely likely to close after the other YET.

>Sean_Wrona: DEGIPQT 2J TEPID +34 86
#note Can't believe I missed both QI and QADI.  Ouch.  I mean, this still might be okay, but I really shouldn't dump my I and D leaving my Q on such a closed board...  Of course if I'd seen QI/YETI (embarrassing since I was setting the YETI hook up) I'd have probably played that, although that can be dangerous (XIS, YETIS bingos...)

>Sean_Wrona: ?ACEGQR 1L AGER +33 119
#note I guess I'm learning here.  In the past I would have automatically just exchanged GQ and not looked for scoring options.  Assuming I draw an I, I'm fine, and I could still exchange the Q later.

#note Whew.  Now despite her bingo I should be in great shape...

>Sean_Wrona: ?ACIMOT E10 .OM +26 166
#note I don't remember whether I didn't see ATOMICS or wasn't sure of its validity.  I would not have found COADMIT and would have doubted that even more.  I've never seen APOMICT.  This sims right around most of the bingos though and ahead of 32 ATOMICs.

>Sean_Wrona: AEGNNTU C10 .ANG +19 261
#note Epic defensive fail, just like BRED against Sean Baizana, when I failed to consider BREDE, which I knew was good when I actually thought about it.  Unfortunately, even though I've seen all the fives, I forgot SANGA was good and I thought this was way more defensive than it was.  Let's put it this way: I'm an above 50% favorite to win after a number of plays, but not this one.

>Terry_Kang_Rau: AIKN K6 AKIN +19 261
>Sean_Wrona: ELNPTUX 8K .XTLE +60 321
#note Well, that was comically lucky...  Now, how did I lose a game by almost 100 points when I was a 75% favorite to win this late in the game?

13:26
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AFHIIRS 14B FAIRISH +86 347
#note BOOM.  I thought this was a desperation phony because I didn't remember SANGA as good and I've never seen FAIRISH and it still sounds ridiculous, like OKAYISH would (which is in fact phony even though I've seen that in real life more than I've seen FAIRISH).  So I challenged, she took the triple, and that's it.  I had a number of good options on the triple myself obviously and there's a very strong chance I could have still outrun this, but challenging the phony ended the game...  I just got a desperation vibe from it and I'd never seen either previous word...  My challenging instincts need some work, but considering I was less lucky than her for most of the game (except for IXTLE) I'm happy that I was in position to choke it at least...
>Sean_Wrona: ENNOPUV -  +0 321
#note I didn't record my rack but since I know OVEN was a possibility and I played VENUE subsequently, I'm guessing this was the rack.  I still would have been leading after OVEN, so it was REALLY not in my best interest to challenge this.  If I had flipped my decisions on this and REVULSINE, I might have won both games.  Oh well.  SOMEDAY I will finally come from behind in a tournament game and win against somebody good and stop choking, and at least neither of these were quite as bad as my chokes against Morris Greenberg or Sean Baizana...
