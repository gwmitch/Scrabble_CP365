#note missed LIQUID.  I stared at it thinking I had a long Q word.

#note j2 filet. forgot about that hook.  Sim also prefers OFT; DEIL is a decent leave.

#note My main decision is which looks more like a phony: TOPLINE or POTLINE
>Noella_W: AW D11 .AW +35 110
>E_Tran: EEHKRTU 4B KHET +34 126
#note More bad play.  EHRT is a good leave.  If I'm gonna take the pts, why not 4D EKE.  And, the bag is slightly vowel heavy
>Noella_W: CEP C12 CEP +31 141
>E_Tran: DELORUZ 15A RUED +29 155
#note Lots of options.  This scores and takes out the most dangerous line.

#note LOUDLY is a neat play.  this sims best.

#note I was quite proud of this find.  Tricky word, tricky find.

>E_Tran: AEEEENO B3 A.EE +16 269
#note Figured she might not know the hook.  But, it's pretty damn dangerous.  Didn't see PESO.  gotta scan the board better. OAKEN is the smart play

#note Missed the DEFI hook.  Overall, a very poorly played game by me.  Missed a lot of stuff.  Must be the end of the day - I knew I wasn't concentrated very hard.  TAXI to set up ORA up top is best.
