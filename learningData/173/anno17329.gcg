>Josh: DEFHIOT H8 THIEF +30 30
#note FOETID looks a tad better. I thought THIEFDOM was good
>Eman: AIV G7 VIA +19 19
>Josh: DDELNOR 10G L.DO +14 44
#note I should have just gone with FONDLED I guess. This move makes esses very valuable and I don't have one
>Eman: AIJO 9J JIAO +21 40
>Josh: DEEKNRR L8 D.RKENER +82 126
>Eman: ?BENOOT -  +0 40
#note Emanuel saw nothing through the R so he decided to chance a challenge
>Josh: ?AALRSZ 14G LAZAR.tS +86 212
#note He would have played BOTONEES, which I would have instantly challenged. I didn't consider just LAZA(R) or Zo(E)AL here, I just went with the pointy play. It could be that another one of the three options is better. They are simming close together, mainly because of how many points the bingo gives back and how likely I am to bingo the turn after LAZA(R). I guess it depends on what I infer from Emanuel, and I think it's something stronger than average, in which case I should go with LAZAR(E)tS cause he probably can't bingo for much afterwards.
>Eman: ?BENOOT 13A BOTONeE +71 111
#note But Emanuel had OBENTOs!
>Josh: AAIMOUU B10 MIA.U +26 238
#note I played this wayyy too fast. I should have stopped myself and seen AMIA 15F for 40!
>Eman: HNT A8 NTH +25 136
>Josh: ACNOUUY 15H YA +41 279
#note not 11J YU(K) cause 15H is so valuable, I would say.
>Eman: GLT 12K G.LT +5 141
#note smells essy
>Josh: CINOUUW E9 UNWO. +16 295
#note maybe I should play N10 CU(T)I(S) here.
>Eman: EORRSTV O6 TROVERS +90 231
>Josh: CEGIIMU N10 ME.I. +25 320
>Eman: NU 8A .UN +3 234
>Josh: CGIIITU C5 CUI.G +11 331
#note I played this too quickly I guess, didn't see he had another S hook at I8.
>Eman: EF C11 FE. +13 247
>Josh: DDGIITY 8F T..I +4 335
#note this seems right, blocking the most likely lane.
>Eman: E J9 ..E +10 257
>Josh: BDDGIPY 6B P.DGY +26 361
>Eman: ESSX 15B SEX +26 283
>Josh: BDEILOO N2 OBOLE +22 383
#note played this cause I intended to draw the Q and didn't want to get stuck with it. Also to leave one in the bag in case I did draw it and he bingoed, and also to block two lanes and not really give him much to work with.
>Eman: A E5 A. +6 289
>Josh: DEIIPQW 4E WIPED +19 402
#note thought maybe there was a chance SARCENA* or ARCANES* was good
