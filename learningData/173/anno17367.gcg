#note I didn't consider FIZ, but as much as I don't like using a Z for 15 points, that's probably the best play since CDLY? with a vowel or two will probably bingo sometimes, but again, even that would be pretty unlikely on this board.  I guess there aren't many truly good plays here at all...

#note Interesting that 14L SOT sims just as well as all three bingos (didn't know holists).  I would never do that over a board with two esses and 2 Hs remaining and a lead though.

>Sean_Wrona: EJNORTW O8 WONT +48 191
#note This sort of play is an embarrassment of riches.  There are so many different comparable plays here and I didn't remotely consider them all and I have no idea which is the best one...  Perhaps this is a 'when in doubt, take the points' play, but I didn't see WROTE or OWNER.  This is still fine though.  At least I saw the spot.  I think I was possibly keeping my leave to potentially set up JEER O1, but that might be giving me too much credit.  I definitely know I intended to play that on the next turn once I saw my rack, but I may have not planned it in advance.

#note And this didn't block me, although I missed the higher-scoring and much slicker play.

#note Way too paranoid of a block.  AVA J5 blocks just fine and gives me a much better leave.  I just didn't consider it or go through all the possible plays there.  Tunnel vision again.

>Jan_Cardia: CIS 14L SIC +34 231
>Sean_Wrona: AAEGHIT 2F HAET +19 308
#note Pretty bad idea and a defensive fail.  Sure, RENTER was ridiculously easy to bingo off of, but so was this.  I needed to think a lot harder on this turn because this is where I could have lost the game.  I was so preoccupied with blocking because I had no other ideas but this doesn't do much to block at all.  I guess AAH or HAG at I3...  I wasn't looking there.

>Jan_Cardia: AIN 13G AIN +9 240
#note And she's given herself a very good chance at this point with this setup, so HAET was basically a wasted play because if she has a bingo rack on the next turn, there's almost nothing I can do about it.
>Sean_Wrona: ADEGISY 3E GAY +25 333
#note At least this corrects my earlier mistakes and makes bingos in the top left quadrant a lot harder and I'd possibly still outrun a row 14 bingo.

>Jan_Cardia: AINRTU 1A NUTRIA +27 267
>Sean_Wrona: DEILMSU 2A UM +18 351
#note I suppose since I drew the last S, I don't really NEED to do this, huh?  Well, it's still good on a score + leave basis and I do have a shot of bingoing on row 14, which would be somewhat hard for her (although I'm aware of ORAD).

>Sean_Wrona: DEIILPS 14B LISPED +27 378
#note Oops.  Jan told me after the game she was surprised I missed LIPIDES, which she remembered as good and it vaguely sounded familiar once she told me...  But it was ORAS that wasn't good so it wasn't playable anyway!  I'm surprised I didn't know that ORAS was bad, but apparently I'm not alone.
>Jan_Cardia: DEEGIOO 15A GOD +20 317
>Sean_Wrona: I 11L ..I. +5 383
#note Okay, now seeing that I didn't actually miss LIPIDES (well, I didn't see it in my rack, but it wasn't playable), I'm pretty satisfied with how I played here.  A couple of my blocks weren't too great, but I have less to complain about than in a lot of the other games...
