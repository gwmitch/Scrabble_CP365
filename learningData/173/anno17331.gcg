>Andrew: Q 8G Q. +11 11
>Josh: ?IINNWZ G1 WIZ +46 64
#note Well that's a good start, I missed WIZeNIN(G)........ I think I saw it though, but it didn't seem like it played? No clue...
>Andrew: BI 9F BI +17 28
>Josh: ?AEEINN 1G .EAN +21 85
#note Preferred this to NE(W)IE cause no worrying about the X later on, you'll see the hypocrisy of that statement later though...
>Andrew: ?DEEESY 10A rEDEYES +82 110
>Josh: ?BEINNT -  +0 85
#note I thought this was one of those "should be good but isn't good" words...
>Andrew: AIV C10 .IVA +16 126
>Josh: ?BEINNT 3E By..NTINE +90 175
>Andrew: EFIST A10 .EFITS +36 162
#note I was surprised Andrew didn't challenge my last play.
>Josh: DEMNORT D4 MENTOR.D +77 252
#note I even held REFITS...
>Andrew: LOOV 5H .VOLO +16 178
>Josh: EILORUU -ILOUU +0 252
#note C3 OURIE is much much better than this. Here is where I started to play really sloppily. I wanted to beat him to the X. I considered (S)ULU before his last play. I missed OURIE.
>Andrew: AGRT 8A ARG.T +18 196
>Josh: EEFMPRT J5 .F +13 265
#note Alright, block the X threat, nothing to worry about in that regard for the rest of the game!
>Andrew: CJU L1 JU.C. +44 240
#note darn...
>Josh: EEMPRRT F2 P.RE +21 286
#note I guess I should play JEEP! But instead I do this, hit my clock, and realize I just created another X hotspot! D'oh!
>Andrew: AKU 1L .AUK +45 285
#note P(y)RE was horrrrrrrible...
>Josh: AEGMRTX F2 ....X +29 315
#note But I drew the X... lol, couldn't even use it
>Andrew: OW E3 .OW +33 318
>Josh: AEGMPRT B2 TRAMPE. +34 349
>Andrew: ACEILRS I8 SCALIER +75 393
#note noooooo
>Josh: ADEEGOU H12 ODEA +26 375
#note I don't know what play would even work here. I think I have to get really lucky and draw a 9 or something. I thought maybe I could outscore him with this
>Andrew: ILLY J10 YILL +37 430
#note nopenopenope
>Josh: EGHNRSU 2L .GH +28 403
#note I thought he blocked a valid HUNGER(ER)S*
>Andrew: ADHINOO A1 HAO +22 452
#note There is a better HAO a few spots down, which is Andrew's best endgame play.
>Josh: ENRSU K7 RUNES +22 425
#note Oh, that's why (U)GH was my best play, 14A (T)UNERS...
>Josh:  (DINO) +10 435
#note I messed up real bad, even though most people wouldn't have found/played By(ZA)NTINE. That's the only redeeming quality of this game!
