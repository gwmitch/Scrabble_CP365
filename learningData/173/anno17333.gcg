>Dan_Wachtell: AEEGJLP 8E JAPE +26 26
#note I would not have guessed until this that AGL is a better leave than EGL, and in addition to being surprised that JEEP sims better, I'm also surprised that 8F is the highest-simming JAPE considering he doesn't have any high-scoring tiles in his leave.

#note I held this.  I can't believe I didn't know the part of speech for JAPE.
>Sean_Wrona: ?CIIORT 11H e.ICITOR +68 94
#note I wouldn't have found any of those other bingos and this isn't a particularly bad choice anyway, but considering finding a disconnected 9 (which I have never done online or offline in thousands of games) is on my bucket list, I'm disappointed about the possibility for ISOSTERIC, not that I knew it.  And yeah, ELICITOR simmed better anyway, although DIPROTIC, which I didn't know simmed better than anything else and I totally understand why.

#note Very bad.  Not only did I miss so many bingos - some of which I knew - this is far from the best fish as I should really do HI for consonant/vowel balance but I didn't even think of that.  Granted, none of these plays are MUCH worse than bingoing, but obviously missing the bingo by itself is bad, and then playing this instead of EH or HI is a much worse fail.  And I couldn't find anything in five minutes?

#note CATKIN - cool word.  I didn't know it.
>Sean_Wrona: ?AEINQR 11B QI +17 175
#note I think TRANQ, QUAKIER, and QI are all basically equivalent here and don't consider this a major error - probably just a slight one, but it disturbs me that I didn't even see TRANQ or QUAKIER.  I definitely prefer this to the other QI because if he bingos after this through the N or G the board may be almost completely shut down...  Probably TRANQ is my preference if I actually see everything, but all these plays are close anyway...

#note Um, this is why I should have played EH earlier after missing all my obvious bingos.
>Sean_Wrona: AENORST L6 NOTAR.ES +68 344
#note I chose to play here instead of EARSTONE/RESONATE for tactical reasons to prevent him from having many bingo spots, but SENORITA is probably better since it largely prevents S bingos on either side, while this will pretty much allow anything.  I wouldn't call it a major mistake though.  The 9 points for EARSTONE/RESONATE aren't worth it in this position.  Quackle said EARSTONE > SENORITA > RESONATE > NOTARIES, but they were all really close 95-95.5% winning percentage.  Perhaps there isn't a wrong answer here as long as I bingo...  I do think this was probably the worst choice though since SENORITA does what this does better and that's so obvious.  Why didn't I think about this during the game though?

>Dan_Wachtell: AEFILRY 13C EARLY +45 285
>Sean_Wrona: DDEHOSU 7F HOD +21 365
#note Because I played NOTARIES instead of the superior SENORITA (which is my choice after thinking about it) the dangerous lines are clearly columns K and M, and it was much more important to block that part of the board than where I did block, and besides this isn't much of a block because of SHA.  Essentially I've just made a second line for him (which he came perilously close to using to come from behind).  Very, very bad.  When I was looking at this just now, I instantly thought of DUH/NU/OH, which I truly think is the best play.  It sims best as well, shuts things down, will likely allow me to bingo when he opens up the board, and if I don't draw a bingo, THEN I can make a safer block on row 7 after that...  I consider this my second significant error (this and HM, the others imo were pretty insignificant...)

>Sean_Wrona: DEEOSUV K4 VOE +14 379
#note Now, this is just stupid.  How can Quackle possibly prefer OVEN to this?  Yes, I have an S, but that's still way too dangerous.  I don't care what the sim says.  Not an error.

>Sean_Wrona: ADERSUU 4K .AU +12 391
#note I shut down the OFT line but I'm not NEARLY thinking enough about the row 6 line which is more dangerous than I think.

3:30
>Dan_Wachtell: ENOSTVW J6 WO +27 346
#note This one's hard.  VOW/WHA sims the best, but I still think it's better because it also almost completely shuts the board down to bingos.
>Sean_Wrona: DEENRSU 15A ....ED +9 400
#note Totally braindead.  But it's my spasms when I play something like this WAY off the map rather than doing the right thing (taking the sha hook I guess, although I was not thrilled about opening up the B and C columns) that greatly irritate me.

1:32
>Dan_Wachtell: EENSTUV M1 VEN.E +16 362
#note Man, we're both mucking this up, aren't we?  He clearly needed his Es to have a shot of bingoing.  Neither of us were utilizing clever enough fishes.  TUN's a cool one.  UNGUARDING easily simmed the best but not a lot of people would think of that.


>Sean_Wrona: EEGNRSU 2J GRU.S +20 420
#note Playing it ridiculously safe but I'm still going to call this a major error.  I needed to be unafraid to play on column 6 after HOD.  And HOD was the truly bad mistake that nearly ruined the rest of this game.

#note Sheesh, glad the U wasn't an A.
>Sean_Wrona: EEN A6 .EEN +12 432
#note Cumulative winning percentage loss via Quackle: 28.1%
Average winning percentage loss: 2.0%
Significant mistakes (3): HM (both board vision/strategic error), HOD (strategic error), LOOPED (total meltdown)

Dan's cumulative winning percentage loss was 28.0% but I'd say only two of his errors were major (LOOP and VENUE) and neither as major as HOD was.
