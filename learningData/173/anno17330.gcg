>Eman: DHNOQSW H8 DHOW +22 22
#note I guess I should play the classic DHOW and hope for an I. This was fancy play syndrome I think
>Josh: AAN G9 ANA +17 17
>Eman: BFIINQS -BFIQ +0 22
#note no use trying to play through this I'd say
>Josh: ADEIRST 8H .ISRATED +83 100
#note I guess FIB was right then, since I would have QI for 44 now
>Eman: GINSSTX 11E ST..ING +44 66
#note phony
>Josh: EEFK 7I KEEF +36 136
>Eman: AISSTUX J4 TUX.. +28 94
#note 9K AXIS seems significantly better than my play here. I missed it. 
>Josh: EHINOPR O1 NEPHROI. +104 240
>Josh: EHINOPR --  -104 136
#note This is CSW, but I promised Emanuel that if he played a Collins only word I would let him play again. I didn't check if this was Collins, and he didn't ask...
>Eman: AAEIOSS K4 OSI.. +25 119
#note But I saw his rack and saw his bingo, and missed where he could play it. I guess that's karma there. I missed a much EAS(IER) and better play here. Ugh, really bad
>Josh: EHINOPR F3 PHONIER +70 206
#note yyyup, I suck
>Eman: AAAEPST L3 APE +23 142
#note saw E4 ATAP but that lets him shut the whole board down next turn
>Josh: ELOTV 2J VOLTE +38 244
>Josh: ELOTV --  -38 206
#note This time I checked if LAPE* was even CSW.
>Eman: AANRRST N2 NARRAT.S +70 212
#note here's my break!
>Josh: ELOTV O1 VOTE +31 237
>Eman: ADIMNRY E5 YAM +32 244
#note I don't know DIRHAM, which plays at 4C. That seems decent, but this seems better
>Josh: BEW G5 WEB +33 270
>Eman: CDEILNR H1 CLINE +34 278
>Josh: GIILN M8 .ILING +19 289
>Eman: DDEIRRU 9C DUR... +12 290
#note phony. Not a good play though, but I felt like I was in a bad position
>Josh: CU C7 CU. +9 298
>Eman: DEFIOQR 12D QI +24 314
#note I didn't like that he played CU for 9, but this seems necessary. I have to hope he has nothing cause I don't have a lead.
>Josh: ITZ 13C ZIT +38 336
#note it took him a long time to play this, which seemed like a bad sign.
>Eman: DEEFJOR 8A JE. +30 344
>Josh: EOUV 13K VO.UE +9 345
>Eman: DEFLLOR O12 F.LL +33 377
#note champ likes this play. I liked that he granted it to me, but all is not won
>Josh: O A8 .O +9 354
>Eman: ?DEEGOR 2H .EGER +16 393
#note I looked a bit for bingos, didn't see any, then proceeded to use 4 of my 14 minutes to rerereverify my tracking and look for bingos on his rack. Then I looked for my best play, and saw that this won unless he had a bingo I didn't see. Had I seen DOGgERE(L), none of this would have been necessary... This is one off 2J DOR though.
>Josh: ?AABMOY 1B ABOMAn.Y +72 426
>Josh: ?AABMOY --  -72 354
#note Turns out I blocked the crazy MAc(C)ABOY!
>Eman: ?DO 14A ODa +16 409
#note althought then I missed 5 plays that score one more point than this... :(
>Eman:  (AABMOY?) +26 435
