#note Thought I could get this by him.  Also thought it there was a small chance it would be good.  I've decided phonies like this are generally bad.  They're very high risk, low reward.  I've tricked myself into thinking that phony 5s and 6s are more likely to be accepted because they are fewer points.  But given my word knowledge advantage over others, I should mostly be phony bingoing, and throwing in phony 5s or 6s only sparingly, for big scores, and to clean really ugly racks.

#note CRYPT(O) is winning by about 0.5% and 8 pts.  This is surprising to me. Given how close the game is, I thought I should take the 4 pts.  I guess the pool is so ugly, I need to keep the better leave.
