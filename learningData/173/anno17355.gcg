#note Look at the score, Tran!  You should be grooming towards a bingo, not chasing a few extra pts here or there.  GENIE or GIE on F is best.

#note I catch a break.  I get a free turn.  I draw a blank.  I think I completely blow it here by not playing JAIL.  Yes, it kills my bingo lines, but with a blank, I think I should be able to outrun him.  After JIG, if he blocks the V/I up top, I have very narrow comeback possibilities. Sim likes J(OE) for defense I presume.  But I want to leave the spot open to score and open the board.

#note 6 tiles left.  Sim likes LEA(F).  I'm getting low on time.  Need to hope to hit an X play in the topright now I think.
>Danny_P: IX B6 XI +27 337
>E_Tran: ?EEELRS G12 .R +3 294
#note I'm low on time.  Outrunning looks impossible now, so I try to fish for TELEVIDEOS*.  Sim says I win 25+% with E(V)E, and have bingo chances by fishing an E also.  Really?  I think its crazy.
