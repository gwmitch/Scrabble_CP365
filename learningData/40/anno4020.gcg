#note i thought about KILTER, but didn't like opening the triple lane. i should've played more attention to the bag and not been as worried about it - only one S and one blank left. KILO vs KOLO b/c of the number of Is in the bag.

#note it seemed like there were a lot of vowels, and i wanted to get some turnover out of this rack. if i'd seen OVERTI(RE) i would've definitely played it. other top plays are at 12L, but i don't think i want to open up the triple lane any more than it's already open.

#note i gave him back the same vowel that was already available, so that's something. this does make the bingo much more lucrative, though.

#note yeah, if only i see TU(M)ORA(L), but i don't, so i open up the top of the board.

#note he needed to not score this much without the blank.  argh.
>k8: ADGIIOP A8 .I +6 325
#note i was starting to feel like this was a lost cause. i couldn't score with the rack, which meant i had to come up with a good score next turn.  i am convinced he has the blank.  the only things that hit with this fish are ?L (PRODIGAL/PODAGRIC) and are easily blocked. it probably makes more sense to play longer and hope to get X, since there are many juicy X spots. PODIA N4, which i had considered, is much better.

#note i don't know where i put the P, but i did score 4 for it. why not ZAP?  i may have had a reason at the time. no idea what it was now. quackle says that ZAG is the correct fish.
