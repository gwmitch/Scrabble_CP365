#note Quackle wants me to play short. OE 10F is an option, but this board is so ugly. Even if AEILN does hit, there's no guarantee that a bingo will play. Problem with AEON, though, is it gives way too much back.
>Rod: ADHN 11J HAND +25 54
>Evans: AEIILSV G5 AIV.. +12 52
#note Quackle wants to set up the S with DIVA M11. That's kinda risky though, isn't it? DIVAN? I'm not saying I like my play, but I'm not sure I like Quackle's either.
>Rod: LNOO F3 NOLO +12 66
#note Not sure whether Rod saw the NAIVER hook or not.
>Evans: BEIILOS H1 BOILS +27 79
#note If I'm going to give up on the rack for this pathetic a score, why not play LIBIDOS M7? E is a much better leave than EI...
>Rod: ELNSTTU 1H .LUNTEST +83 149
>Evans: EGIIRRS 3C GRI. +10 89
#note Missed GLASSIE/GLASSIER through LAS for double-doubles. Maybe taking the points with RIDGIER is better too?

#note In retrospect, I like MAX M3. I think my best chance to win is to block TUQUE, block QUAD, and pray that the U is in the bag. If his rack is BCELQTU, for example, then MAYBE I have a shot. I'm really not sure though. This is a complicated spot, and it's possible that Q-sticking him isn't enough to win this game.

#note Was planning to go out with PLASMID for 40 next turn. Rod blocked it. He's smart like that.
