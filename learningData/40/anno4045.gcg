>Noah: AEEIKOY 7G OKAY +26 26
>dacrON: AEEIJRV E5 JIA. +22 42
#note Conrad (thought process): "Oh, I have JARVE(Y) for a lot of points. I think thats good. Well, lets look at what VEEJA(Y) does *puts down VEEJA(Y). Ew, no I don't like that. Fine I'll just play JIA(O) *plays JIA(O) and hits clock*. Oh right, JARVE(Y), that has to be good. I NEED TO PAY ATTENTION!!!! Oops...
>Noah: AEEIIOT -AEIIOT +0 26
#note Noah: I don't like JIAO because of the comeback, and because of the state that the board is in, I'd rather go for turnover than keep something like AET.

>dacrON: EIQSSTY M9 YETIS +34 173
#note A nice Q "setup."
>Noah: AAGMOTT F2 MAGOT +29 230
#note Noah: Looked on column M, but did not see the nice M(E)TATAG............................................Conrad: There goes Noah again with his putting "the"+descriptive adjective before a play.
>dacrON: EILNQSX L12 QI +46 219
>Noah: AAFGNTT L4 AFT +23 253
>dacrON: ELNNSWX 11C NEWS +37 256
#note Conrad: Didn't see W(A)XEN. Still like this because the X is almost guaranteed 40+ next turn and he is most likely to bingo with (QI)S.
>Noah: ACGNOTV 3C VAC.NT +24 277
#note Noah: I did not see VAC. For some reason I thought I was ahead here, by a lot, and so I needed to block lanes. Now now! Should've played TAV. In hindsight, probably a game-losing mistake.
>dacrON: EIIILNX 12B NIXE +51 307
#note Conrad: Note the vowel situation in the pool.
>Noah: ?GINOPU H1 PU.ON +24 301
#note Noah: Didn't even think of PUT. Also, I really need to work on looking at the pool! Was fairly low on time here.
>dacrON: DHIILWZ 10I WHIL. +19 326
#note The D is a blessing, but I manage to have NO (OWE)D plays. WIL(E) should be considered in case I dont have ANY good blocking plays next turn with (OWE)D ((W)HIZ is guaranteed then), but WHIL(E) still scores more, extra tile, etc...Just one more turn, and I can pull this off...
>Noah: ?DEGINU 11J ID +17 318
#note Noah: Probably need to bingo to win this game. GUAN and NUDE B12 look like they may be good choices. I had about 3 minutes left after this play. 
>dacrON: BDIORUZ 13E DRUB +16 342
#note Conrad: Uhhhhh...where is my play (now now CP!)? I'm pretty sure DRUB is best, or at least near CP's choice of DUI...(B)IZ is left. Setups off the B could be a problem though. Thoughts?
>Noah: ?EEGNSU H12 o.E +4 322
>dacrON: BILORTZ G12 B.R +10 352
#note Conrad: I was so low on time that I didnt even consider the new outplays of (BUR)S/GENUS. Not enough time left to go through the sequence of TO or LO which both win. Anything else, I spaced on. I could've just as simply played TO or LO, but I made the dumbass decision. Turns out Noah was low on time too. I think overall, if we both had any time, we would've played the endgame correctly; instead we both had to just guess...heh...
>Noah: EGNSU 15E GUNS +36 358
#note Noah: Now now! I was so low on time that I immediately played GUNS. NEGUS/GENUS wins. The really annoying thing is that I could have gone over one minute, found NEGUS/GENUS, and still won ...........................................Conrad: funny how we both missed it lol...
>dacrON: ILOTZ M1 L.Z +24 376
>Noah: E J10 ..E +6 364
>Noah:  (IOT) +6 370
#note Final time is Noah 0 seconds and Conrad 1 second. Conrad: Overall, I'm still happy with the YETIS-DRUB sequence.
