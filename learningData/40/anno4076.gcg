#note DISTORT/DISROOT 13A score best. ROOSTED M2 is the most aesthetically pleasing (esp since it plays next to FOWL(S)) - this and TOWARDS are the only things that take out the triple lane without creating huge hooks.

#note frustrating.  i've been at cross-purposes for too many turns, trying to bingo, shut down board, etc, all at once.  i give up on this and just try to move us toward the end of the game. i make GANDER to go with FOWL.
