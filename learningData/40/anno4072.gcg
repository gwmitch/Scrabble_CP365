>Joe: ?EEGMOS 8D MOnGEES +74 74
#note An inauspicious debut for my game-a-day.  I allowed this primarily because it gave me a decent comeback, and because I knew he would bingo soon anyway.  If I had to redo it, I'd challenge it off and make him find a real bingo.
>Joey: ?CEEEMO K5 COME +26 26
#note Just like that, no phoneys on the board anymore.  EMCEE is a little better.
>Joe: OY 7I YOM +23 97
>Joey: ?EEERRT 6C gREETER +64 90
#note Missing six bingos that score better.  Must be those first game jitters.
