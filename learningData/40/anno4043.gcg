>Jason: EEEIIPR 8G PIE +10 10
#note Missed PEERIE. Exchanging keeping RIPE (which I considered) is also better. (-11)
>Carolyn_Easter: GJ H7 J.G +11 11
#note Carolyn lamented the lack of an open A and played this. I could tell already this wasn't gonna be pretty.
>Jason: BEEIRRT J8 REB +17 27
#note We were each 5-8 with good spreads (for 5-8s anyway) going into the last round, so I commented that we might play. Carolyn (against whom I was 15-5) commented that I was the last player she wanted to play. But I sat next to the Bohnsack/Keller game, and I think I was 0-4 sitting next to Bohnsack. I blame him for my bad tourney.
>Carolyn_Easter: ADHR K9 HARD +25 36
>Jason: AEIINRT 12J I. +3 30
#note Whiffed on (P)AINTIER; considered that whole part of the board dead. Big now. (-29)
>Carolyn_Easter: EFIMOPV 9F VI. +13 49
>Jason: AEINRTY 12I Y.. +7 37
#note Paying for PAINTIER. I can't even complain about missing my fish. (-4, to HARDY)
>Carolyn_Easter: GLMU 11F GLUM +14 63
>Jason: AEINRTT 10J ..T +5 42
#note I hated this play. Had visions of Carolyn making a four-tile play from M10 and making my life even more miserable. Sim likes it, but I'm still not sure if I do.
>Carolyn_Easter: OW 11K .OW +8 71
>Jason: AEHINRT M11 .HA +18 60
#note Ooh, H(W)AN would've been cooler. (-8)
>Carolyn_Easter: ABIO 10D OBIA +23 94
#note Carolyn put down COBIA, then picked up the C and said she should keep it as a hook tile and "I like Cs." (In the recount, I accidentally counted this as 22, which would've led to a tie. When I re-recounted it, though, I saw my error.)
>Jason: DEINRRT H5 RE... +13 73
#note I knew this was a stupid play, but at this point I barely cared. Doesn't sim badly, though. Duck's clear pick is NITRE, 14K?!?!?! Hm. (-3)
>Carolyn_Easter: CEILOOS N5 COOLIES +70 164
#note "Way to keep your C," I commented. "Yeah, I probably would've drawn another vowel, huh?" she commented. I nodded.
>Jason: ?DINNRT 6B INTeND.R +62 135
#note Didn't see INDENTOR for six more, didn't notice this was two more at 6E. R(E)NDiTI(O)N would've been sweet. (-7)
>Carolyn_Easter: GIU 8L IG.U +18 182
>Jason: ACEEFIY 5E YEA. +27 162
#note Or (R)EEFY/(R)EIFY, or FIA(N)CEE/FAIE(N)CE. One from the latter pair is best. Halfway through, 7/10 power tiles left; it's time to turn over. (-3)
>Carolyn_Easter: EFNOT 14K OFTEN +26 208
#note Carolyn goes the turnover route; although I doubt it was because of her cognizance of the unseen pool. :)
>Jason: ACEFIRX 15G REFIX +54 216
#note OK, I finally lead. Now if I can keep this positive momentum going...
>Carolyn_Easter: ?ENOOSW 14B SWOONEd +75 283
#note (sigh)
>Jason: AACOQUV 13A QUA +36 252
>Carolyn_Easter: ALU O12 LU.A +15 298
>Jason: ACELMOV 4A VOCAL +33 285
#note With this EM leave and a nice spot at 15A (and TEEM practically probable next turn given the pool), I felt like I still had a good chance to win, better than the 17% chance Duck gives me after this play.
>Carolyn_Easter: EEZ 15A ZEE +45 343
#note This being the last NSA tournament/last tournament without the NASPA code of conduct, I took the opportunity to unleash a four-letter word when she hit her clock. "I'm in deep trouble now," I said. "I like hearing that!" she commented.
>Jason: AADEEMR D3 M. +4 289
#note  When I saw there was only one unseen vowel, my mood brightened a little. "Interesting," I commented. "Yeah, I've got issues," Carolyn said. "I know. And your rack isn't very good either." (rimshot) I had there being 13 unseen tiles. Re-tracked the whole game but only got to 12. Then I decided to look at the T's (since that's what I was fishing for anyway) and found three on the board, not two. Should've done this on her time, as I felt like this was the play. Can't win without bingoing, this is my best bingo chance and it's unblockable. 3-in-11 ain't terrible odds. However, Q says MA(C) is almost 50% to win, which I can't believe. DAP, NAP, TAP at 3B next turn and then what? My play isn't mentioned. Poo. I'm still proud of it. (-2)
>Carolyn_Easter: NT 13A ...NT +18 361
#note Ooh. Hoped she couldn't play off two and score. I feared D(O)S.
>Jason: AADEERT 2A AERATED +75 364
#note Yahtzee! 1-in-8 chance now. C'mon I! One more miracle! (Yeah, not so much.)
>Carolyn_Easter: DINPSST 1F PINTS +28 389
#note It's always fun to play Carolyn at the end of a close game, watching her fix her hopeless tracking. One of about five times we were shushed by various Div. A players came when I'd fixed my track pre-MA. "I've got it figured out," I said. "So do I," she said. "You do? I was banking on you mis-tracking," I said. Then I played the M and she said "I didn't have one of those!" causing me to laugh loudly. Carolyn's endgame/track is admittedly weak. Lucky for her, 1) the last tile was a singleton. She noticed right away the K was unaccounted for, scanned the board and figured it out. 2) It makes the endgame easy. She can't block KA effectively; so score as many as you can, leave as few as you can. She even played it out and figured out it won by one. I lamented the fact that somebody with an admittedly awful endgame had seemingly had a brain transplant with Jan Dixon.
>Jason: K A1 K. +18 382
#note "You're not going to recount, are you?" Carolyn asked pre-PINTS. "Not if I'm ahead," I said. Carolyn's math can be sketchy but it was spot-on here. A rough ending to a rough tourney.
