#note missed the two triple triples (which are weird words - i would've probably missed them, too), and then decided to try for something better next turn... i would've just played HESItAtE and gotten on with my life.
>k8: ACEGIMU A4 MU.IC +36 124
#note i saw CESIUM and MUSCAE, but decided a couple less points and holding AGE was better than AG or GI. MUSIC also prevents a bingo down the B line. after he took a long time on his last turn, it seemed reasonable to make it harder to bingo at least in one place.

#note janglers/janglier double double... 
>k8: AEGIIIN 1L .EAN +33 157
#note INIA, GENII or this.  quackle likes the other two better, or trade II. also likes JANE better than JEAN, if i'm going to go this route. i also flirted with GAIJIN hoping he'd hook an S, but decided to take the points.

#note thank you, tile gods, for getting me out of that situation safely.

#note i held. i went through words in my head (PADI, PATY, WADI, WADY) - i'm 80% sure this is not good, but that isn't enough to risk having to slog through my current rack twice, so i decide to just keep the small lead on my next turn and hope.

#note i couldn't be sure of TOGUE (sigh) but felt compelled to take out the lane.  i like that this keeps OVER and OUT words a possibility through the R. OGIVE L11 sims best.

#note now i'm just trying to outscore and keep decent leaves.
>kc: AEEISST C1 TEA +12 278
#note i think he said i blocked SERIATES, so this may be his real rack, o ri may have remembered wrong.
>k8: BENORTU C5 T.UEBORN +64 375
#note whee! i also have a bingo through the G.
>kc: AEHIPSS B10 HEAPS +53 331
>k8: BGILSTZ 12A B..G +20 395
#note if i draw the Q, i'd like to have two places to get rid of it. i meant to play LANG to keep the BIZ possibility, but i forgot by the time i decided to go with this strategy.
