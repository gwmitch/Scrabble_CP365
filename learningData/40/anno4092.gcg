#note i held for long enough for her to courtesy draw, which i pretty much never do.  i vaguely knew RASHLIKE, but this looked completely unfamiliar. she had LAKIEST and SEALIKE available too, so it was a tough choice. not sure how i convinced myself to challengs.

#note she almost didn't see it - really nice play.  i probably would've missed it.

#note missing yet another bingo. no wonder i lost this game. GIGOLO is better if I don't see GEOLOGIC - I was vaguely hoping to draw a challenge.

#note at this point, Jan overdraws. thinking there are only three in the bag, she pulls all four.  so i have to decide what tile i want on my rack, based on my current rack and the unseen pool.  with all the time in the world, maybe i get this right, if there is a right choice. my choices are AEM. what do you put back, with a minute to decide? i hadn't seen my play yet, either. i went with taking the tile with points, with the logic that she'd mave M and W to score with if I put the M back. with full knowledge of her rack, quackle says UNZONED is a pretty high win percent compared to my play, which is second, but in reality, it'll lose, too.

#note i suck. i never see this six in flashcards, but even if i play it and go out, i lose.  i thought METAPE* was good, but it's METEPA.  i missed two bingos, so this game is my own lame fault.
