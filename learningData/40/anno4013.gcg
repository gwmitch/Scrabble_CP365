#note Ugh, I somehow missed the J4 spot to play his. I thought about (DID)IE, but didn't EIKRS was better than EEIS by enough to merit the sacrifice. But I(R)K or FAKERIES should have been spotted, and look like they are the best options here.

#note I didn't play YE because I was afraid I was going to get another unplayable bingo, but this is probably wrong, I shouldn't let paranoia effect me, but that will be hard to change.

#note A forunate draw, and an interesting postion, I thought. Quackle absolutely despises this play, even with inferences, but I disagree, I think it gives me a fighting chance. Quackle has ZE(A)L as so far ahead of anything else. I almost played EXIL(E), but rejected it because of PA(G)ED and the like. I like this play because there's not that much he can do about it and I likely have a great play next turn AND the turn after. Is Quackle being stupid here, or am I being stupid? That is the question.

#note Quackle once again wildly disagrees with me, pointing out EXIL(e)D as it's favorite. One pro of EXILED are that it opens up a strong scoring spot, so there are two scoring spots open. However, if the opponent plays along row 12, both are nullified, and I am screwed over. I think that a human might more commonly respond that way, and that is part of why Quackle likes EXILeD so much. The reason I like this play is because it keeps good tiles to continue scoring with. I need to keep scoring to win this game, and I can really rack it up with a good Z and a good X play. Another interesting position. Terribly screwy play or not?

#note This here, though, this is just faulty reasoning. I was thinking since this left me ZONULA, and opponent probably plays here more often than there, this is better. But what am I thinking? My opponent will probably take out either spot because they are the main places to score, and ZONULA scores more and keeps a better leave. I think the game would've been different if I hadn't stupidly made this play.
