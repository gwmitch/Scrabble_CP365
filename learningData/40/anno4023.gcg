#note Do I play MAXI, ADMIX, or ADMIXT? Quackle prefers ADMIX and ADMIXT by a tad, but I prefer keeping it somewhat closed with my 65 point lead.

>Rafi: ADGIJMV 5E JAM +30 179
#note Quackle likes VID 13B, but it's silly to set up my J in such a close game with 4 A's still unseen.
>Sammy_Okosagah: NRW B6 WR.N +15 176
>Rafi: BDGIIVZ L11 GIB +19 198
#note VID wins the sim again, but this time I think it's not as crazy. WREN probably means that Sammy has a 3 or 4 consonant leave, so chances aren't as good that he will have an A. Should I create a phantom setup in hopes that he will sacrifice points to block it? I also don't like how GIB sets up a bingo lane, but I don't think Sammy had a very strong leave here either.

#note I have the only hook other than the K, and this setup could be difficult to block.

>Rafi: DEHNRTV N10 VENT +23 312
#note Didn't draw the E for VENTER, but at least my spot wasn't blocked. VENT is better than VEND because of the H setup.
>Sammy_Okosagah: CEEFORY N10 ....ER +18 343
>Rafi: ADHKOOR A1 DHOORA +38 350
#note Probably my biggest mistake of the game. According to Quackle, DHOORA gives me a 24% shot, ARK wins 32% of the time, and AH at O13 is at 35%.
