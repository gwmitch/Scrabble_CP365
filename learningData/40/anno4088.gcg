>Pete: GNNSTTW -GNTW +0 0
#note best.
>George_Viebranz: DEMORW 8D WORMED +32 32
#note I needed a minute when I saw this... I held, trying to place the word for a bit, think of it as an adjective rather than a verb.  At some point, I woke up and accepted it.

>Pete: CGINSTV E7 V.TING +20 20
#note I chickened out on COVING, the clear best.  VOTING was second.
>George_Viebranz: IOP 7H POI +14 46
>Pete: BCENRST 6J BRENT +25 45
#note Best by a decent margin.
>George_Viebranz: HOO 5J OOH +26 72
>Pete: AACINOS 9G OCA +24 69
#note I don't believe I missed this. MANIOCAS  I even saw the possibility, and totally blanked to the fact that there was an M on the board.  I even studied it TODAY.  I hate myself sometimes.  Of the non-bingoes, OCA and CASINO are best.
>George_Viebranz: ASY O6 SAY +26 98
#note I hold, because part of me thinks BRENT doesn't take an S...
>Pete: AAIMNQS -  +0 69
#note And that part of me, combined with a couple of decent possibilities for the Q, prompt me to challenge.  In a tourney, I think I play on, but in a casual game, worth checking.  I suck.
>George_Viebranz: H I7 ...H +8 106
#note I wonder if he's close to bingoing...
>Pete: AAIMNQS J10 MANA +25 94
#note I decide to get fancy, and then even mess up getting fancy.  QIS wins, QANAT second, and MANIA is far superior to MANA.  However, I did read him as about to bingo from his one tile fish, so better to give him a line that creates board variance.  I still shoulda done QIS.
>George_Viebranz: AEFGINS 14G FEASING +72 178
>Pete: IINQRSU 12G QUI.IN +32 126
#note so I create all this fun variance, even draw a rack that could bingo thru an E... and nothing.  Duck likes QUINT there
>George_Viebranz: AWX 15F WAX +71 249
#note G** D*** Variance.
>Pete: ADIRSUV 10B VIR.D +21 147
#note Passing up better plays to open a weak line.... but it is a line.  VAUS m9 wins 2.9%, VIRID 1.26%.
>George_Viebranz: IIPT 4L TIPI +26 275
>Pete: AABRRSU B7 BRA.URAS +76 223
#note This rack frustrated me.  I had to stand up and talk a little walk to clear my head.  Then, when I sat down, I noticed that BRAVA would leave URS, put them together, and realize I had just made a sweetass find.  This play mad my night.  Still only 9% to win or so, but these are the finds that keep me playing.
>George_Viebranz: DEZ A13 ZED +52 327
>Pete: ?DEEORT C1 tETRODE +71 294
#note The only playable bingo.  I was sure I had to be missing something.  12.5% to win now...
>George_Viebranz: EEG M10 GEE +20 347
>Pete: ?EEEJOU A6 JOE +41 335
#note I can't complain about my luck in the second half of this game.  My timing was phenomenal... up to 42%
>George_Viebranz: CO 1A CO. +12 359
>Pete: ?EEKNTU C9 T.NEs +39 374
#note Duck hates my play.  I don't agree with it. I don't think there's a way in hell that George, a real live expert player, will let me bingo.  and with the S unseen (and I assume in hand for him), I'm not about to concede the spot.  Ducke likes KEP and AKEE.
>George_Viebranz: EILLLST N2 LI. +10 369
#note TRILL wins 82% of the time... wow.  WILL is second best.
>Pete: AEFKLUU 4C .UEFUL +20 394
#note I made the losing play right here, as I did not know TELLY takes an S.  any of the plays getting rid of Kand F without setting up a better out line win.
>George_Viebranz: ELLSTY 2B Y.LLS +30 399
#note Fortunately for me, GV didn't know it either.  TELLYS?!?  really?  c'mon.
