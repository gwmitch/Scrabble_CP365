#note 7G DUH wins the sim. (-1.5)

>Matthew: CEHIJNR I7 J.HN +26 52
#note I knew this play wasn't as good as it looked. Q says keep CH together with 9G JIN (-9.8)
>Jeremy_H.: AI 9H A.I +12 66
>Matthew: CEEINOR J6 RO.. +21 73
#note Didn't see 10F CONNER. I probably wouldn't have picked it. (-5.4)
>Jeremy_H.: EILRTTY -EILRT +0 66
>Matthew: CEEINRT 7L .E +4 77
#note Best.
>Jeremy_H.: ?HIORST 11F HOISTeR +83 149
>Matthew: CEFINRT M3 IF +19 96
#note 12G IF wins the sim. I didn't like killing that part of the board. (-0.7)
>Jeremy_H.: AEX N5 AXE +30 179
>Matthew: ACENRTT O7 TRACT +26 122
#note Terrible. TANREC is a bad miss and I somehow didn't see the obviously better spot for TRACT at O1. (-16.9)
>Jeremy_H.: AEU 10D EAU +12 191
>Matthew: AEEEGLN O1 ALEGE +26 148
#note ALEGE* beats all real plays. GELEE is best.
>Jeremy_H.: AZ N1 ZA +37 228
>Matthew: EEEIINS -EEI +0 148
#note Simming surprisingly close is Exch. EEEI with all those E's unseen.
>Jeremy_H.: DEKN H11 .NKED +33 261
>Matthew: AABEINS 3J A. +5 153
#note Apparently i had the wrong idea. I liked keeping the B for the BEAU hook, but that wasn't as crucial as scoring points and opening a lane. A(W) does not set up a lane at all. AB sets up my S and nets way more points. BANIES is not that great a leave. Weak play. (-56.2) for not knowing IKEBANAS.
