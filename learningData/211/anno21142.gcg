#note STYRAX 2A for 64 pts best, mine 3rd.     EX F1, which I nearly played, was 2nd.  
I'm not wild about the S in the triple lane, though the odds of a trip-trip specifically seem very low with S in the 2-slot.  I don't mind spending the S, given that there are two more and a blank unseen to me.  It scored 8 pts better but was only valuated 3 pts better on the sim.

#note INDOL 15F was best.  My play didn't initially appear, but finnished 2nd when simmed.
That said, since Quackle doesn't have the newest words in, I'm doubtful it was too good, as shall be seen shortly.
