#note Unsure of what to do, so I'm just blocking hotspots.
>Nigel_Richards: OPR M13 PRO +26 256
>Winter: EELLQST I2 Q. +11 328
#note I felt the game slipping away here, with no idea what to do. I can block the hotspot and still get slammed at H1, and left with a Q. Or I can risk that he doesn't have a killer play, ditch the Q, and block that H1 spot.

#note AARRGHH!!!	
>Winter: EELLSTT 8L .ELT +18 346
#note Might as well go for a bingo now, since I need to score.
>Nigel_Richards: ADT K5 TAD +22 347
>Winter: ELNSTUV N6 VU.N +15 361
#note I didn't see the NU/(QI)N setup for my Q, but if I had, blocking and hoping to draw the Z would have been my choice. Nigel is too dangeours if there are bingo lines.
>Nigel_Richards: AEEINT 4C TENIAE +21 368
>Winter: DELSTUZ 5D LUSTED +30 391
#note I burned through most of my remaining time looking for something that scored, ditched the Z, and left me positioned to go out. I couldn't find it, so I finally just through up my hands and decided to go for luck.
