#note Liking NOBLE a little better here now. I guess the bottom NOB lets me play LUN whereas the top one doesn't...seems mostly a tossup.

#note Lots of close options in this spot. Would be nice to score there while sealing off the line as best I can. My play doesn't really do that, so GARDAI looks better - but maybe GAD is safest of all to avoid making an R hook as well as an S hook?

#note No thanks to 5K INVAR or 13D RAVIN. Maybe VIN instead of VAIN, though.

#note Oops. Thought there were 4 in the bag. Though really the only losing scenario here looks like EXODERM. However, if I just play 6L AR and he plays the high scoring EXODERM I have out bingos with any combination of the other 3 tiles (EOP)
