#note I'd rather play a closed board against Tony, so I chose COYPU over OUTHEARING or POUTY.

#note or DITZ? I'd rather make it harder for him, DITZ makes it pretty easy.

#note The only bingo seems to be InD(UR)ATeD, for 60, 14th on speedy. I'm not very good at comparing ?? to ?... DeID looks good now, ?? isn't too much better than ? here, I can wait to bingo until the board is more open. ADIT?? bingoes a lot though, IODATION or IDEATING happen with EGINO draws. They sim about evenly.

It's interesting to think which will make him sacrifice equity more. FED shows a strong rack, but on this board it's both less likely a play like FED requires a great rack, and a great bingo rack isn't as good here.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEKORSV 4A VOAR +30 305
#note I was way too focused on the 4a and 1a spots. ZEK is sick cause there is only one more S. SOAVE is the word I missed. I was wary of leaving the spot open, but ZEK is good because I save VOAR (and he's more likely to take 1a), and I leave a few spots open, whereas VOAR can be countered with an A1 or 1A play that leaves me with nothing. I like SOAVE after ZEK to take care of the spot.

#note that was a bailout if I've ever seen one.

>Jackson_Smylie: EEOOSTW 15D WOE +26 369
#note This was a weird turn, I wanted to do something about the bingoes on the upper right side, but ENOW didn't do much to stop ING plays, and scored a lot less than other plays. WON seemed rather stupid, because I need to focus on outrunning. Hindsight is 20/20, and I think I need to just keep scoring. WOO for 8 fewer points is a big consideration... EEST is similar to EOST as a leave, but there is one e left and 2 o's.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEOSTTT 12A TAT +15 384
#note champ likes TAT. I was going for GOONIEST or GOOPIEST, and hoping he'd slap down QI immediately. I'd win by a bit.
>Tony_Leah: IILNNOQ 7M Q. +42 474
>Jackson_Smylie: ELOOSTU O1 LOOT +24 408
#note the only suitable block for ATOC I saw was OS, but ELOTU didn't make an outplay. TOTE does it nicely, leaving LOURS for 23 and out. I also thought there was a chance he'd miss the spot.
