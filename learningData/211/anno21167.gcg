#note BARCODE is cool. I'd prefer playing this on the bottom generally, but it gave up a bunch of nice hotspots.

#note We're both down to a couple minutes here, and I have both mistracked and forgotten to care about my tracking, so I am thinking he's close to a bingo here, when in fact JQXZ is in a pool of 17 tiles. AR blocks that opening, but something like L(A) 11a probably works better. FRIT is of course nice, or FLIT, to try and draw at least one vowel, and push the score. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EINSSXZ A11 NIXES +41 289
#note Based on my last play, Gabe should be able to deduce, I think, that JOQ is in the bag. Obviously I didn't have the J otherwise I'd play JAR, and unless I don't have the T the Q is not on my rack. He should be able to tell I don't have the O because I would try and block the A column otherwise. Of course he was low on time, and didn't have the time to deduce all this, but I think if given more time he can determine JOQ is in the bag. Perhaps the Q is on my rack, but it's unlikely, I'd probably want to play more tiles to draw vowels in that case. As well, since I'm low on time and visibly rushing, I could very easily be misplaying it and could have a worse rack. But JOQ is a very reasonable 3 tiles to be in the bag.

Given that, Gabe pretty much has to draw the O to win. Maybe keeping an I could help if he gets the Q, but SEZ only offers one Q spot that I can block. I think he has to play ZINES (or NIXES, but ZINES seems better) and hope he doesn`t draw the Q. JO is a fine draw, JO and SIX both play along the G column, and I would get Q stuck. It was a really weird endgame given the time pressure and JQXZ all being out, and especially JQ being in the bag. Sorry gabe.
