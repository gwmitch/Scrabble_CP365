>Will: AEGLLOV 5C G.OVEL +20 92
#note Will said he considered C2 VALE and VO(R)LAGE. He didn't like the big spot VORLAGE opened up, and he didn't like VALE's leave. I think he should play VOLE on the other side of BARIUM.

>Josh: OOPSTWY 9A YOWS +34 150
#note BOWS is better, but I think I was right to get rid of the S too.
>Will: IILPRRS A7 PR. +24 193
#note It looks preferable here to get rid of the duplicate I instead of the duplicate R, given the E on the board, the 3 extra points, and all around superior flexibility, despite there not being a very flexible option. Also, if Will wants to stay as flexible as possible, SPIR(Y) was an option he also considered. After YOWS, I'm likely to have another S, so he might not want to do that, though, which makes YOWS a good exploitative play. I did play YOWS because it seemed he was sort of weak after QINDAR. 
>Josh: EEHOOPT 10B HE +32 182
#note Lots of plays are interesting here. Perhaps it's correct to blow things open a bit, since QINDAR and PRY seem to have left Will pretty badly. Given the prevalence of consonants in the pool, it's not a terrible thing to leave myself vowel heavy, which is why HOOP at 9G is not bad. I considered HOOP and HOO there, but I felt like I should sort of get rid of some bad case scenarios with clunky racks, like J-bombs at 7C. He doesn't seem to have the X, so 9G can wait, and I also want those floaters to stay open for myself.
>Will: DIILRRS 11C DIRL +18 211
>Josh: AEIOOPT N1 OPE +24 206
#note I don't have an S, and Will likely has one, so this stops a lot of immediate death scenarios where Will bingos down column N. That's what I liked the most about this play. He doesn't seem to have left any points on his rack, so it seemed less dangerous, especially since it might worry him that I have a huge play here next turn that he has to block while fishing. The other option is blowing things open with 8K (R)ATIO, which looks decent as well, but his leave seems consonant heavy and sort of bingo-potent, so I don't want to give him more vowels. 
>Will: DEHIORS 1L HO.D +36 247
#note HO O1 is better, just because of the leave.
>Josh: ACDINOT 7C C.D +26 232
#note I was kind of confused here, not by Will's play but by what I was supposed to do. It was really a race to a bingo if I play here, but I could also play elsewhere. What do you think? 
>Will: ABEIIRS 3B BI.E +16 263
#note (W): Tacking on the E makes me bingo less, not only because the pool is consonant heavy but because column L requires an E to bingo. Bad job by me here
>Josh: AAINOTT 2A OAT +16 248
>Will: AAFIRST 9G FAIR +25 288
#note Absolutely tack the S on here. 
>Josh: AIMNTUY 8K .UNTY +27 275
#note I missed MUT(EL)Y, making my biggest blunder of the game. It did seem about time to blow things open though, since I do need to bingo to win I think. But MUTELY saves me for a few more turns. 
>Will: AEEGLST 10I GELATES +69 357
#note SEGETAL at 10G is better, as it's 7 more points and still blocks things up. Will missed that it played with more overlaps, since SIG seemed to come to him at the last second.

>Will: EKV H1 KEV.. +36 393
>Josh: CGNRWXZ 7J Z.X +28 375
#note Apparently W(A)X in the same spot is better, but this draw just crushed me.
