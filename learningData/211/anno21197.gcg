#note damn you MULETEER! I missed you again. I also thought about just playing JUREL instead of bingoing, which quackle agrees with if I don't find the 2x2 (although he gave me the dime).

#note lucky me
>Puneet: OO 4D OO +12 84
#note thus began a streak of poor drawing for puneet. I think he had EIOORSU
>JD: AEIOORU H1 OURA.I +18 161
#note I didn't see OURIE at 4H, but this actually sims better - few Es left, and also OURIE gives back easier scoring plays.
>Puneet: AEIRU 4H .UREI +17 101
>JD: AABEIOS 3K OBIA +19 180
#note both of us struggling through some vowels

#note the pool is hyper-heavy on consonants, so this leave should fill in nicely
>Puneet: CMY C2 MYC +25 196
#note jeez, he couldn't even use the nice spot I gave him
>JD: AAAIINX A7 IXIA +35 314
>Puneet: AEGNOST -AEGNO +0 196
>JD: AACENPR B1 PAN +23 337
#note the pool is so heavy on consonants that I felt it best to conserve a 2C-2V leave.

#note lol nice draw
>Puneet: BDM 2G D.MB +15 252
#note some day this dude will draw a bingo

>Puneet: DEPV --  -23 252
>JD: ADHILOV A1 OH +35 493
#note erm, why didn't I play ODAH for 60? I have no idea. I wanted to save the V for the VEGO spot if he played PED at M7 next turn, but that is a silly reason not to score 60!
>Puneet: DEPV J4 ..V +14 266
>JD: ADILNNV 9K NIV.. +12 505
#note Q really likes fishing an N and forcing Puneet to block ANDVILE in case the E is in the bag, but I know he already has it. this is not awful, I think.
