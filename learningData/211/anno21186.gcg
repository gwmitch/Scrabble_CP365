>Josh: ACEFLTX H8 LATEX +40 40
#note Points or no points?

>Josh: CEFILUU 12J FUCI +25 65
>Larry: HWZ M10 WH.Z +38 62
>Josh: ELLPTUW 9G P.WL +16 81
#note J10 W(OF)UL!!!! (I didn't play well this game, but I did draw well...later...) W(A)UL is better too
>Larry: EY G7 YE. +14 76
>Josh: EGILTUU N6 GLUTEI +25 106
>Larry: ADOP O7 APOD +44 120
>Josh: ?ABEOSU 12A SAUcEBO. +93 199
#note To think I would draw into this. Let alone see it?
>Larry: CEHIMRS K3 CHIMERS +88 208
#note SMIRCHE(S). I held this cause I thought it was a phony spelling of CHIMERE. Did you know that CHIMER, CHIMERE, CHIMERA and CHIMAERA all mean something completely different?
>Josh: AKLNORS B10 KR.AL +38 237
#note Lots of vowels left. I somehow didn't think so, but I saw that there were a lot of consonants to play through. I should have gone with KO(A)LA.
>Larry: GVY E9 GYV. +22 230
>Josh: ADEINOS 3H DIO.ESAN +74 311
#note surprised I saw this one as well.
>Larry: EIMT 2L TIME +26 256
>Josh: ADEERRT L2 ..ATED +33 344
#note I saw RETREAD, but not over the board???? it plays in many spots. Wow. I saw TREADER didn't play and then decided that I would likely win a challenge with this word. He held, but to no avail.
>Larry: EO 13F OE +18 274
>Josh: AENORRV 4C OVERRAN +78 422
#note this is luck
>Larry: AENRSTU 15B SAUNTER +84 358
#note At least Larry was also drawing well.
>Josh: ?ADINOR 1N OD +26 448
#note He blocked sADIRON. I was a sad iron after that. But I looked and looked and looked and couldn't spot DO(O)RNAIl. It gives me another spot for my Q so it's correct to play it. AD is better cause I bingo more often with the O. But AD doesn't garner a challenge(??) from Larry. OMA is a word now!
>Larry: EFGINOQ -  +0 358
>Josh: ?ABIINR 10B .I +6 454
#note Reducing the value of QI if he has it, and setting two spots up for my own, as well as setting up bingos for myself. Except I draw into literally nothing. I should play what I played next turn, this turn.
>Larry: EFGINOQ C9 Q. +21 379
>Josh: ?ABIINR H1 IN..BA +27 481
>Larry: EFGINO C3 G.NIF +26 405
#note I1 FO(IN)ING is 2 points better, but quite difficult to see.
>Josh: ?IR N13 aIR +14 495
#note 14D mIR is 15.
>Josh:  (EO) +4 499
