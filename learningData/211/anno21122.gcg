#note HUH D6 best, mine 7th

>Margaret_Yoder: DEILORR --  -67 62
>Matthew_Ridout: CDEEGIP C5 EPIC +23 134
#note PIECED 14B #1, mine off the board
12 points is a lot to miss, but I didn't think EPIC was so bad, as it defends a big play from D1 and gives a fair 2-1 consonant to vowel (CV) leave

>Margaret_Yoder: EILM A1 LIME +30 140
>Matthew_Ridout: ?AEGORS 14A ORGEAtS +72 314
#note ARCHIVES for 48 pts won pretty big here.  GALORES for 85 was the big bingo miss.  ZAG, DOGEARS in two spots, and ZERO all outperformed my play
>Margaret_Yoder: CLO A12 CO.L +27 167
>Matthew_Ridout: ELNNNOY L4 NONNY +34 348
#note Hey Nonny Nonny - I think Shakepeare may have coined the perhaps-nonsense phrase, appeared in Much Ado About Nothing.  May also have been in a song from the musical "Once Upon a Mattress" was was in during high school.
Anyway, NONNY outdid all valid choices, the best of which was NEON H1

#note WAIT, same spot, #1, mine...a har behind
>Margaret_Yoder: AER 8L .EAR +21 214
>Matthew_Ridout: AEEQTUV N6 QU. +32 409
#note AQUA N5 #1 after 1000 iterations at five plies.
Initially, C.P. had rated EQUATE M9 as best, but it fell outside top ten during the sim.   
My play didn't even appear initally, but simmed at 4th
>Margaret_Yoder: X 10D ..X +29 243
>Matthew_Ridout: AAEEITV K10 AVIATE +21 430
#note DATIVE 10J #1, but the second best play fo AQUAVIT was far cooler.  mine was 3rd.
>Margaret_Yoder: AMRT L12 TRAM +33 276
>Matthew_Ridout: AEGINNR H8 ..RN +4 434
#note NUS 12C was the top recommendation at first, but ARCHIVES won handily with simming.  My play was off the board.
