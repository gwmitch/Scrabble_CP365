#note Clear best play is M8 EAU setting up the H at N10
>Jason: ?FMNNOR N9 NONFoRM +78 110
#note I was so sure Jason had played NONFARM that I didn't look at the blank slip. Later on when I drew the Z in the endgame I pointed out that I had another Z spot at 13M with ZA, which confused Jason. Feel pretty sure I challenge NONFORM* if I notice.
>Will: ADEHINU 15J INHU.E +45 130
>Jason: ENW O8 NEW +26 136
>Will: ADDITVW 4I DAWT +28 158
#note Hmm. Legitimately thought WANTINGS* was good.
>Jason: EEFGILR 6E FLEERI.G +66 202
>Will: DEIOOVV 5A VIDEO +28 186
#note Close with 5B VIVE. Take your pick.
>Jason: ADIO A4 A.OID +30 232
>Will: EKOOPUV D1 POOV. +26 212
#note Should probably take KUE now, but EKU seemed to have much higher upside than OOPV and it stood a decent chance of being there next turn. Since I can't make a play that leaves anything good, it also felt like a good idea to leave J14 open for Q/X bombs. Missed UPDOVE entirely, though.
>Jason: AEIT 1D .IETA +21 253
>Will: BEGKSUY 14J KUE +40 252
#note A couple other good plays here, but long term, the S/KI hook is too valuable to pass up.
>Jason: EO 4D .OE +12 265
>Will: ABEGISY F6 .E.BIGAYS +69 321
#note Haha.
