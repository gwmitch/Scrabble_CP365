#note Didn't spot YEOW, didn't love AEI after WOMBY. Played bottom YOWIE to maybe cash the B at 8D.

#note Was very close to doing D8 POUF with my full rack knowledge. Quackle says go for it. Also considered just plunking down the F at 3G.

#note 3L LARN to preserve the X bomb chance? Maybe. It's a weird position. My play is wrong because it just never bingos and it gums up the board in a way I don't need. 9K LAX also gums up the board, but at least LNRS can hit some vowels on rare occasions. 3L LAX keeps the board open but yields easy scores. Maybe I have to live with that.

#note Did not see F1 GLOBIN. Looks like the play at 7A is GIN, not DIG - boosts my bingo% by almost 10%.

#note Trying to keep the ELECTIONS hook alive, it's easier to bingo there than through the L of WALL.
