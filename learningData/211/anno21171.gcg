>Joel_Sherman: ABCEFIO 8D BIFACE +32 32
>Joshua_Sokol: AACGMOU E5 GUA.AC +18 18
#note not ideal but I thought this set up an A hook only I could use, but GUAIACA isn't a word... Still, maybe would have gotten away with it.
>Joel_Sherman: ABEKOSX 6B BEA.X +36 68
>Joshua_Sokol: LMOORTW E5 ......OL +22 40
#note I should have played WORM. It creates another dangerous spot and leaves much better. But I wanted to play the word I missed in Montreal!
>Joel_Sherman: AADKOSW C2 AWOK. +24 92
#note WA(C)KO 10C is significantly better than this, as is DAWK for D11, a word Michael didn't know.
>Joshua_Sokol: LMORTVW D1 VROW +45 85
>Joel_Sherman: ADDGHIS J6 GADDI +29 121
#note Nice phony, I thought it was the adjective and BIFACE, since it takes the S, was the noun. I would not have challenged GLADDISH, but Michael didn't like it. It's not a word. GADID is better here, but again, Michael didn't know the word.
>Joshua_Sokol: GLMOTTY 2B T..TY +32 117
>Joel_Sherman: HJMNQSS 7I H.J +26 147
#note tough turn
>Joshua_Sokol: GIILMOS 10A LOGI.ISM +67 184
#note This is collins. I didn't know it. But I figured I would get awak with that.
>Joel_Sherman: AEMNNQS 1F MANE +25 172
>Joshua_Sokol: DILOPRT L3 TORPID +36 220
>Joel_Sherman: ENOQRSS M7 SENOR +26 198
#note He's got to get rid of that Q now I think, but there are U's left, so playing a lot of tiles seems good to go for the U's and the blank.
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLOTZ A8 ZI.L +39 259
#note Really worried about the blanks now, I feel like I am in much better shape getting rid of that L. ZLO(T)E is 48 though. I prefer this.
>Joel_Sherman: NPQSSUV 13E SUQ +34 232
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEHLOT N10 HELOT +47 306
>Joel_Sherman: AENOPSV 15L VASE +42 274
#note O9 NOVAE is the play. It makes it very hard for me to block.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINRTY 12H ENTIRE.Y +88 394
#note I knew he wasn't going to challenge, because SENORES is a word. 
>Joel_Sherman: DENOPRU 11K PO.. +22 296
#note Game over here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEFINT 3H FETA.IoN +72 466
#note This was tough. I don't calculate things often enough, but here I calced that I would win no matter what after this, so it was just a question of average spread. I felt that 3x3s were very unlikely through the N with the pool in question, so that was enough, because otherwise his likelihood of bingo-ing is much much larger down column O.
>Joel_Sherman: DEINNRU O1 DI.NER +24 320
#note Michael doubted INURNED. That's his play. This is 17 points off.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EERU 9G sUR. +21 487
#note But that calc involved me seeing the sickest outplay I have ever seen. Can you find it?! It's the only outplay, and trust me, I looked hard. -10.
