#note I considered this for 27 as well one spot down, but it seemed that each placement allowed Bernard to score similarly. Seems that is untrue. I probably missed that Bernard can now land a Z-bomb at F6, or any 30-35 point easy play that I don't want him to have the choice of doing. Interesting choice between the two plays, but I now prefer the 27-pointer.

#note Still blind to F6. KA for 40 is absolutely the best play.
>Bernard: CGINOSS L3 COSIGNS +87 179
#note Very nice! Bernard played well this tournament. 
>Josh: ?AEGLRT 13G LiTREAG. +70 231
#note Now here comes another very low point in the tournament. Actually, two low points. How come I thought this was a word? It's so high prob that it seemed ridiculous. And I missed higher-scoring options too. The best play here is the beautiful F6 LAuG(H)TER. To Bernard this looked like me trying to draw a challenge, so he let it go after a long hold.

#note Now I saw the hotspot and wanted to get rid of it...
>Bernard: AILORSU N2 SAURIOL +74 298
#note And then I let this go after holding a while, because I couldn't see what Bernard would be confusing this with. That's usually how I determine whether or not to challenge a word that I'm not sure of when Bernard plays it. It seems he had been confusing this with SAURIES, and I wasn't confident enough in my word knowledge that I knew this had to be invalid.
>Josh: DDIJN 14E DJIN +31 360
#note This was the only thing that scored and left decently, but I don't remember my leave. This was dangerous, maybe I should have just played JIN O1, but it left two D's.
