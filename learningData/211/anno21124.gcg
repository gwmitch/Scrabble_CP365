#note Looked at JURAT, JURANT, and JUNTA and noted that they all yielded PIEZO in return. It's a good bet that Steve gets it correct on the next turn. But I didn't consider JERRY which is the best play by far, since it doesn't yield any high scoring placement of PIEZO. Missed opportunity.
>Steve: AEIOOPZ D10 PIEZO +42 56
>Will: AAEIRSU 10D ..UA +8 58
#note Or G4 URAEI which does score nicely.
>Steve: EF 13B FE. +30 86
>Will: AEIIRST I3 AIRIEST +67 125
#note I regretted this positioning after playing it. I think i'm giving away points needlessly.
>Steve: EKY H1 KEY +35 121
>Will: ABBCDLO 2B CODABL. +36 161
#note Close with 7E JOBBED and even just JOB which bingos nearly 40% of the time, thanks to AEI all hitting (BACKLOAD, BLOCKADE, DIABOLIC/BIOCIDAL). Still, probably preferring the CODABLE path against Steve.
>Steve: AELNOSV 5G VE.ONALS +72 193
>Will: BILOPRT C1 P.TBOIL +24 185
#note Overlooked the best option of B10 PROFIT.

#note Not a good sign here.
>Will: DEGMNTW E1 M.WED +22 355
#note Quackle likes 13F TWINGED. That's not a play I remotely considered. I suppose given the bingo proneness of the unseen tiles it's not insane to block and try to make it one more turn, but to me MAWED makes more sense to try and somehow evade blank bingo that's likely coming and draw a natural of my own.
