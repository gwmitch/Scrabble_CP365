>JD: ?EEOSUZ I8 .OZE +33 49
#note debated between COZ or COZE, since the latters gives back a lot more scoring options - quackle agrees that COZ is better by a couple of points, which doesn't shock me
>Sandy_Nang: IX K10 XI +37 53

#note um, I had many playable bingos including the brilliant HUNKSES# (wtf?)

>JD: AEHILMU L1 HUMA +32 188
>JD: DEEGIKL (challenge) +5 193
#note hmm, I spotted HIEMAL# at L2 for 44 but passed it up because of the naked U leave versus EIL after HUMA. quackle says HIEMAL is about 3 points better, which seems fair. Why does quackle think I score more if I play HUMA at 4A than L1? I'm confused
>Sandy_Nang: AELORSS M4 LASSOER +63 181
>Sandy_Nang: RTW (challenge) +5 186
#note SOLERAS is the cool 4th anagram in this rack that plays for 80.
>JD: DEEGIKL 2J KL.GE +40 233
#note hoping to cash in the D hook on KLUGE at some point

>JD: ADEEENP 3B PEE +21 285
#note major miss, I saw COZENED at some point and then forgot about it and missed PEE/UPO/COZENED for 37!! that would've been cool. at least my play dunks her bingo percentage from 35% to 22%, while also giving me a nice 50-poinbt lead
>Sandy_Nang: AII 15G I.IA +9 244
>JD: AADEENV N10 EAVED +26 311
#note I spotted YEVEN but passed it up to block - but, totally whiffed on ADVENE# (a word I know too well, see my game against Lisa Odom at 2015 Nationals). Still, her bingo percentage has now collpased to 1%, which puts me in excellent position to win.
>Sandy_Nang: IPR O13 RIP +20 264
>JD: ADEFNRR 1L .ARD +29 340
#note I'm pretty cool with my play over REYNARD or DREY, both of which open lanes. FEARFULNESS would be pretty sicknasty if I were losing instead of winning.
>Sandy_Nang: EGNORU A4 .OUNGER +33 297
>JD: EFINRTT 5J T.N. +14 354
#note hey, quackle likes my move! any play that retains the I in case I draw the Q sims well. my bingo odds are low so taking a few extra points with TANA sims pretty well.
>Sandy_Nang: BHILOQT 11E QI +23 320
#note spot for more at 3I
>JD: ABEFIRT 2D FIBER +23 377
#note ran out of time went over and trainwrecked the endgame. oops.
