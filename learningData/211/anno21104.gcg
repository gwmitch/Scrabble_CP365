#note I have to beat Shauna by 48 more points than what Tony beats Gabe by to win the tournament. I want to play an open board, but not have too much volatility. I didn't like setting up the BEZ spot. I didn't like BIPOD very much, but BES is similar to DIS. BIPOD was nice for the S setup, but what does YE show? not necessarily S, but something nicer than usual and likely not many high pointers.

#note TOGA is an improvement, especially with 0D and 3T left. I was very tempted to ask the director if I was allowed to look at Gabe's scoresheet during the game, it could help me know whether to block the S. I think in any case I should have though, TAO looks right.

#note The pool is weird, I wonder how often she has QUIXOTRY. OUNCE is okay. COUNT also seems nice since the T doesn't combine with the x or q, and I could draw a blank.

#note we were trying to piece together her rack, she thinks she had this - quixotry is sweet! She was thinking of QUIXOTE at the time.
