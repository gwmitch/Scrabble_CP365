>Terry_Kang_Rau: ACITVY H7 CAVITY +36 36
>Josh: ELOOUUV 11F OU.LOVE +20 20
#note After she played CAVITY, I immediately recognized the possibility of (CAVITY)ING. I doubted its validity, but the more I trailed in our game, the more I convinced myself I would have to try it if I didn't have any option that compared. CAVITY as a first play is already a tad better than average in terms of winning%, as it scores well and is very defensive, but if you then give the opponent my rack, ELOOUUV, that winning% goes from around 57% to over 70%. Not an issue, as I believe I can outplay Terry so long as I don't play a phony. So I should have told myself not to attempt CAVITYING. The issue was that I played VOLUMING, hoping VOLUMED wasn't an adjective, and it came back valid. So I liked CAVITYING's chances, since CAVITIED is a word and CAVITY has multiple definitions. One of them is bound to be a verb! The two plays I considered here were OU(T)LOVE and exchanging. 20 points seemed worth it, despite my U leave, as it's important to stay in control of where the board will lead you when you aren't a favorite to win. I really don't like giving my opponent a free turn to do what they want with their play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: DILT L8 TIL.D +14 50
#note First laid down LILT(E)D, and she didn't like it. Terry was already using up a bunch of time, which is a big advantage for me, except that before she put down a play, I assumed she was looking for the best bingo of dozens or something like that. I was sort of on tilt, as you can probably tell.
>Josh: EGNOSUW 10E OW +26 46
#note I was holding UW, which partially explains why I was on tilt. But this play wasn't bad, it kept a positive leave, unlike last turn, and it scored well enough. I also considered NOW and ENOW in the same spot, so as not to give back as much, but I kind of need to keep the board open to avoid bad scenarios. The leave of EGNUS seemed too good to give up by playing my N. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: DEELTUX D7 EXULTED +102 152
#note This seemed really bad, but my play only gave her 9 more points than her next best placement. Maybe I should have played something very defensive last turn instead of aggressive?
>Josh: EGNORSU 8A ROU. +33 79
#note Or maybe I just shouldn't have missed SURGEON! I need to focus in the games I'm losing. I would not have missed this word in any scenario where I was not on tilt. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: IWZ C12 WIZ +41 193
>Josh: ?EGHNRS E1 GoRHENS +72 151
#note It's possible I should forgo the bingo this turn and play C7 H(U)NG.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BINO 1A BOIN. +27 220
>Josh: GIIMNOR H7 ......ING +54 205
>Josh: GIIMNOR --  -54 151
#note BOINGING+! If I had known that was good I wouldn't have had to attempt this. Hoped that if it came back no good, she would give me an N or an A. Obviously she will challenge this, no question.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: FI 14A FI. +30 250
>Josh: GIIMNOR 4D O.ING +22 173
#note Still BOINGING. Maybe I should play 13A IM(ID)O since it opens up the bottom. Probably.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: IQS M7 QIS +28 278
#note for sure she has the other S here. This is trouble.
>Josh: DIJMOOR C3 DOJO +34 207
#note Now I have to keep the M for ISM and not open an S lane with the 39-point DOJO at M11. Ugh. I also considered keeping the J for future scoring and playing MO(F)O at A12. Maybe that's right, perhaps she'll even challenge that. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ENP B6 PE.N +22 300
>Josh: AAIKMRU N2 RUMAKI +55 262
#note Now even though I know she has an S, I felt I needed to play this, since it scores 7 more than KU(F)I, and she might either a) keep her S if she doesn't have something big enough at O7 or b) play something that isn't that good and that opens another lane. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Or maybe it isn't that desperate, and I should play KU(F)I. Dunno. This was held.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ACS A12 CA.S +36 336
#note And now that I draw my S, I know she has the last one. But this is probably the weirdest part of this already extraordinary game... It actually did not occur to me that she had just played her S, even though I saw her play, tracked it, scored it, everything! I am used to playing opponents who would never ever play CA(F)S with another S unseen and a lead that can only be lost with a play down a lane that they can block! Simply SAC for 9 less would completely shut me down, and would probably win 98 games out of 100, and yet, Terry admittedly got greedy. It seems to have been the perfect play for her since I simply didn't realize what she had done! Amazingly it seems she didn't have an E here, with 7 in the pool, which adds to the bizarreness of this game. Or maybe she did and missed CA(F)E, this is also a possibility. In any case, I have to give Terry credit for getting one of the most obvious details by the player who seems to notice just about every detail about his opponent's plays! 
>Josh: AAEEIMS O4 MAISE +59 321
>Josh: AAEEIMS --  -59 262
#note Given my earlier information that she had an S (small detail, she doesn't anymore), I felt I needed to block this spot now, and score enough to stay within range. So I decided to play another blatant phony.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BEEN O1 BENE +30 366
>Josh: AAEEIMS O6 ASEA +30 292
#note Still completely off target here.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AEEFGRT M1 FAG +25 391
>Josh: ADEIMTT M11 DEMIT +31 323
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EHR F2 HE.R +31 422
#note I was baffled by this play. Terry admitted this to being greedy too. She didn't see a bingo I could have through the T so she just went for her own. If I score something through the T, I can win by 2 points.
>Josh: AEELNTY 15K NE.TY +27 350
#note bad, but I ran out of time. Best is LY(T)TA
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?AAPRRT 14H APTeR.A +27 449
#note -12 to APoR(I)A
>Josh: AEL 15G ALE +19 369
>Josh:  (R) +2 371
