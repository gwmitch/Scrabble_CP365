>Joe_Edley: ACELORR 8C CAROLER +70 70
#note Joe makes funny plays sometimes. I'm fine with this placement, although it is probably beyond a shadow of a doubt the wrong one.
>Josh: ?AEITTU J8 sITUATE +69 69
#note EUsTATI(C) is the bingo through the C I was sort of looking for, although it's not ideal. It gives back a lot in the short term to Joe, whereas sITUATE might not go that badly. 
>Joe_Edley: FGR 11H FR.G +16 86
>Josh: AAKQRTW H11 .ATWA +36 105
#note There is a very small chance that that F or the row under sITUATE is going to stay open for the possibility of (F)AQIR next turn, but I6 WA(R)K is definitely a play I need to see and consider, despite it being wrong.
>Joe_Edley: EPX F5 EXP. +29 115
>Josh: EIIKNQR C8 .INQ +16 121
#note Other plays I need to see (and usually do I think?) are ones that immediately set my Q up. E3 KINE is a much, much better play than this. Damn.
>Joe_Edley: CHZ 5D CH.Z +36 151
>Josh: EEFIKRU C8 ....UE +34 155
#note Tough between (CINQ)UE and FI(Q)UE, but I think I need to focus on scoring next turn and not allowing Joe to score enormously either, so I'll take (CINQ)UE.
>Joe_Edley: GGV 12B V.GG +18 169
>Josh: EEFIKRT 10B K.IFE +24 179
#note This turn, it was tough between K(N)IFE 10B and D3 FE(C)K, since FE(C)K kept a superior leave, but that leave isn't really worth much on this board, so I think keeping ERT is more reasonable and flexible, since it also prevents Joe from overlapping and scoring nicely, leaving me with one-point tiles to not be able to respond.
>Joe_Edley: IMNOOS 15J SIMOON +40 209
>Josh: DELNORS L5 RONDELS +69 248
>Joe_Edley: AOOT 13H .A.TOO +14 223
#note After he hit the clock, I said "nice". He responded "yeah, it's hard to find with crappy tiles. I keep playing O's!". It was at that moment that I realized I was going to lose this game.
>Josh: DDEPTUV K2 DUVET +24 272
#note 6I UPD(O)VE is a fine play that I missed. It blocks a lot of stuff! Seems like the right play to make here, but it's close.
>Joe_Edley: ADILMNO O8 MANDOLI. +86 309
#note But nothing blocked this, so there was no use looking for the right play.
>Josh: AADELPS 6E A.AL +27 299
#note In the same train of thought as my previous few turns, I felt like scoring and keeping good and flexible leaves was the way to go, but I'm sort of in trouble here. Maybe I need to keep a better bingo leave, such as with 11E AD. I also considered blowing things open with PALA(C)E D1. The pool is very scoring-heavy, and not really balanced at all, so either he's going to score well next turn or get into some clunky trouble most of the time. Hoping it's the latter, since that option seems more likely. 
>Joe_Edley: EJOY M3 JOEY +37 346
#note perfect. (Don't make mistakes)
>Josh: DEIPRSY 14B ESPY +36 335
#note Nothing seemed decent here, I felt like I just needed to try my best to keep up, and hope he didn't draw anything of value. PYRI(C) D1 is the play I missed, but that's so do or die, not sure if I like it. I also missed the two options at F12, YIP or YID. YID looks better just because I bingo more often with my PERS leave and because I score a lot better hooking YID. Turns out I think it was right to play this, since Joe was ready to hit me with something in this same spot. 
>Joe_Edley: IN 11E IN +20 366
>Josh: DEEIIRW G8 .ID +19 354
#note No chance he was giving me a spot to bingo, right? I hoped he had the blank and the S and decided to open something up. No luck. The play here seems simple enough, 2I WI(D)E. I just flat out missed it, cause I didn't consider making a play through the D, since that was my only line. WI(D)E not only sets up two lanes I can work with, but it also sets up a scoring spot, so Joe has to decide if he is going to try and outrun me or try and block my bingos. Tough decision at this point in the game, since any play at 1L he makes is going to empty the bag and lose to an out-bingo, and any blocking play is both difficult to achieve and will also lose to many scoring plays I have at 1L. This play might have won me the game.
>Joe_Edley: HU 15A UH +20 386
>Josh: ABEEIRW 2D BEWARIE. +74 428
>Josh: ABEEIRW --  -74 354
#note Turns out the last tile in the bag was the blank. We worked out that I couldn't win anyway. Quackle concurs.

#note -9 to BRIE, BREN, BINT, BETS, BEST and BENS. lol
>Josh: EEIRW N10 EEW +20 384
>Joe_Edley: ?EST O1 .oTES +5 425
#note Don't remember which word he played here. I thought AXALS* was valid. I wouldn't have challenged if he played there, I think. haha
