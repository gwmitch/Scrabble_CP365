#note Big mistake, as AGISTeD plays. I probably would have missed it too.

>Josh: ?LMORSX H11 .XiOM +63 225
#note It was so close between L1 LOX and (A)XiOM, but I figured that the board was much nicer for me after AXIOM and that I would bingo often enough anyway. Seemed to avoid bad scenarios more often.

>Josh: AADLNRS L11 .LAND +18 243
#note I saw M3 AND, and probably didn't look at it long enough to see its merit. But I really wanted to accomplish something with this play, so I blocked the best of the M bingos, and prepared to play eastward from the D next turn if need be to close down the best of the H bingos. I didn't like how the board favored a huge comeback bingo by Sam. The issue is that AND allows me to bingo almost 1/3 of the time compared to a bit more than 1/5 of the time with my play. Another stat worth noting is that by far the best scoring spot on the board is parallel to NORIA, and I am cutting Sam's best scoring plays by around 4 to 5 points if I take the spot myself. That should probably be enough to play AND, but my line is not an unreasonable one.

>Sam_Moch: AEOOSTV 5B TA.OO +14 198
#note This was starting to get ridiculous. 
>Josh: DFGINTY 6C D.IFT +35 360
#note I guess G(R)IFT is better since it doesn't take an A front hook. Saw DRIFT first unfortunately, and that was enough.

>Josh: AEGKLNY 2K ..KY +36 396
#note Missed M2 YANG, which I might have played over this, but anything is fine here. Maybe G13 KYE is the best play.

#note I almost played VANG B10 here, that would have been oops.
