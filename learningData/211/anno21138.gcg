#note Okay this play sucked and I knew it while I was making it but just gave up. My first instinct was VIRID but I didn't love that because it would force me to redraw a consonant that fit at 8L. I saw VIZIR but didn't love that Joel could then hit me there without an A. I think I then saw B10 VIER but didn't realize that it scores about as well as MIRI with a much superior leave. Any of those three are improvements.

#note Another interesting situation. So the threats here are X bombs, the blank, and to a much lesser extent 8L plays with the last A. Joel just played CWM which doesn't tell me a heck of a lot, but it is a block of an X spot, so I think I can mostly proceed as if the X could still in the bag. This play blocks (P)A?? words that open the board leaving one in the bag and leaves me the X spot where I can hopefully outrun without getting bingoed on. CP picks HEIL too.

#note The tantalizing EXURB has to wait. This play performs best because if Joel plays BUNCHING or BUNCHIER I get a bigger X-bomb.
