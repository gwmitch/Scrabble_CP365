#note lucky break

#note an overreaction, I really didn't want him to just be able to play LOAFERS. I'd never played Puneet before so I wanted to test his anagramming skillz. best looks like GALOP at 7F which is surely way better

#note nice, underscored by 2 though

#note ideal play here is TOPLINING which I did not come up with, which doesn't give back the improbable 3x3 lane

#note much better play that blocks similarly (although not quite as completely) is TIER at E11. at least I blocked, no other spot is really going to beat me at this point.
