#note Sure, there's room to quibble about these exchanges. I'd rather just say no to vowel-heavy leaves.

#note Debatable, but probably better to take an extra 6 points for a play at L1.

#note Probably the biggest mistake of the game. INFAMY (L3) is a standout, and even something like FAWN would be much better. I can't understand why I thought FIRMAN made any sense whatsoever.

#note Looks like Mike played a pretty good game. I don't quite understand the exchange, and on turn 5 I would have gone with some type of fishing play. I had a number of questionable moves, but the tiles saw me through. I suppose my focus was slipping a bit by this time.
