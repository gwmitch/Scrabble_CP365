>Bing: AEEEHQU 8G QUA +24 24
#note This was a tough call. It seemed barely worthwhile to play QUA, but I didn't feel very great about it. I don't know if there's any right answer here, but Quackle supports the play (although the 8F placement sims marginally higher). EH is an interesting alternative.

>Bing: ?EEEJNR L1 JE.E +54 108
#note Typical of what happens when the J is slotted in position 5: an easy, rack cleaning 33 points for opponent (not that there was any real alternative this time - I saw and quickly rejected the horrible dEJEUNER).

#note Thought I was missing something better here, and I was: uNRIPELY D4. This turned out to be much worse than just the 4 point difference as it gave up a convenient 30-point dump.

#note This was a pretty weak move. CLEMENT (14F) probably would have given me the best chance to win, but as the tiles lay, that too would have come up short.
