#note Not terrible, but JO (7H) is probably better. I would say that the inferences from my opening play make it a closer choice than Quackle thinks.

#note Good choice to pass up the low-scoring bingo THRUSHEs (E1).

#note Obviously, I had to be pretty sure of DIGITIZERS to put the game on the line, when a challenge was all but assured. It may not have been the smartest move, but at this point in the tournament, building up a big spread could have been critical in making a finals berth.
