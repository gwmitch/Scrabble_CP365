>Noah: EHKNPTY 7I KYTHE +36 65
#note Missed KELPY (Q's pick and my favorite as well). Quackle also prefers KEY G9.
>Matthew_Steele: AAEISTT J9 SATIATE +67 129
>Noah: GMNPRUU 11E PUN +29 94
#note Surprised by how much Quackle dislikes this-it likes PUR a full 3 points better. I guess I determined this leave wrong. It's favorite is MU here. Is that because of the UP combination and the I for ING? Probably. This doesn't do very well.

>Noah: BGMRUUW 15G UMB.R +27 121
#note Quackle prefers WRUNG L10 by a fraction of a point.

>Noah: ?AELORW K10 WO +19 173
#note Missed two bingos here. Bad. I missed WALkOVER (looked through the V, but didn't know WALkOVER) and WAtERLOO. Now now! No missing WAtERLOO!
>Matthew_Steele: AEIM L10 AMI.E +25 232
>Noah: ?AAELRZ B10 AZ.RE +32 205
#note Didn't know the TIGHT bingo that plays here. Can you find it? I whiffed on LAZY, which Quackle likes much better. Quackle is right.
