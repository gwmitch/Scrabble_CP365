#note Not crazy about this play.  I suppose I could try TENANT G7 but he'd probably snuff that out in a hurry.

#note I didn't recall this variant of FUSILEER, and Dave's gotten some weird stuff past me in prior games, so I guess I might as well keep him honest.
>Bing: ADEIOTU O7 ADIEU. +42 293
>Joey: DEINORS L3 ROSINED +79 325
#note At least I was smart enough to know that this was a noun, and not a comparative of FUSILY*.  :)  I preferred this over the higher scoring but more volatile ORDINES 4A.
>Bing: EEELOOT 4A OLEO +20 313
>Joey: ?BHIOPY A1 BOY. +27 352
#note I guess I can just slide this 7 columns to the right for 7 more points.  The score is too close to worry about just triple-triple columns.
>Bing: EEEKLTT 14C LEEK +25 338
#note I needed some luck, and this seemed like the best shot to make something happen. It happened, all right.
>Joey: ?HINOPQ B10 QOPHs +92 444
#note You don't see this one much anymore.  Nothing like an endgame stress killer.
>Bing: AAEIJTT 6B JET +32 370
>Joey: CDFINNR C1 FIC. +18 462
#note I'm pretty sure he didn't have anything up there, but I wanted to be sure.
