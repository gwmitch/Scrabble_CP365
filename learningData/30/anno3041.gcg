>Sam: ?DINOTU 8F OUTfIND +68 68
#note Fairly easy opening rack here, but I don't see anything yet...OUTfIND? Haven't studied that but it should be good, I think. Yes it is good. Other bingoes are OUTwIND (wouldn't have been sure) and cONDUIT/NOcTUID (knew that pair)
>Comp: CEEEFKL L2 FLECKE. +34 34
>Sam: DEILRVX 7G XI +36 104
#note The best thing I see right now using the X is XI 7G. Still don't see much else. Seems like it could be alright, DELRV isn't terrible, not too many vowels open but E and I at least. LUX is actually interesting now that I think about it. Not gonna sacrifice 17 points for DEIRV vs. DELRV though, esp. with an early lead and the opponent with a totally random rack. Might as well keep it rolling. I'm going to play XI. The sim likes it by a lot it seems.
>Comp: AEEOQRY 6J YO. +18 52
>Sam: DELRRSV 4K R.V +6 110
#note VIRL looked like a decent dump at least, but blocked now. I could try VELD 9C but RRS isn't great...it is VELD not VELT right? Ugh I always get confused, I think it's VELT* though, VELDT obv. Comp just played two though, YO for 18, a fishy play. Certainly if they didn't have bingo tiles they would have played more off, there are much better scoring places (through FLC or something, or even just playing longer through that K). I don't like VELD therefore, leave the VE totally open and opens OD for the hook. What about DELVER 4H? Does open up sevens lines, but blocks basically any eight at least. Keeps a pretty good leave. REV 4J is another possibility, but DELRS isn't terrific and could give nongos a home. LEVER is yet another possibility. The good thing w/ LEVER or DELVER is it opens two sevens lines, so if they bing I could bing back possibly. After REV--bingo I could have good triple counterplay. I can't make up my mind between REV, DELVER, LEVER. Leaning towards REV but w/ no vowels open seems risky. Then again LEVER and DELVER give him sevens he otherwise wouldn't have if he's w/out S and ?. I think I'll go REV, dunno though. ... REV is leading the simulation, and it feels right to me. What do you think?
>Comp: AAEEQRR -AAEQR +0 52
>Sam: DEILRST M6 ED +21 131
#note Haha, for all my defensive worries Comp traded 5 anyway. A balanced draw of IT but I don't see any bingos here. Just listing some options, not that I specifically like them or not: ED M6 21, YOKED 6J 17, EL or YOKEL in those spots but those are 17 and and 13 respectively, LIFTED 2J 24 (or RIFLED I guess) but that just seems reckless, hm. I could see Quackle liking a ridiculous fish like ED 7L but I'm not doing that. I like ED I think, keeps it closed and keeps a decentish rack while also keeping the scoring up. ... Quackle actually likes OLD F8. This seems pretty good, keeping one of the premier leaves with row 11 and columns M/N open for bings. Should I have done that? This leave is sorta crappy, esp. compared to EIRST. Wish I had a do-over already, would play OLD.
>Comp: AEEIMNR 2L .IE +12 64
>Sam: ILNORST 1M LOT +13 144
#note Sure wish I played OLD, would have EINORST now. Just looked for tens thru FIE haha, would probably need another vowel though. FIE was weird. It only takes F I believe. YOKEL is a decent fish for 14, but if he has S or ? I'm obv. pretty screwed. I could keep maintaining the lead with LOT for 13 instead, and keep the board closed again. INRS is an awkward leave but not a bad one. YOKEL is the riskier play (more "volatile" I guess?), but I'll stick with LOT and keep plugging. ... Simulation thinks YOKEL clearly best. I was worried because of the past fishy play of FIE, but would YOKEL have been worth it? Don't know...
>Comp: AEEHMNR 9E EH +10 74
>Sam: ABINORS 10E NOB +17 161
#note Haha in between plays I changed the album I was listening to to In RainboWs. Yet another fishy computer play, but there isn't much to do on this board anyway. Bingoes still seem unlikely though, EH only takes FHP and OH takes OS obv. I'm liking NOB 10E, doesn't leave much bingo potential while keeping the good leave. I'm playing it. ... The sim slightly prefers ROB in the same spot. I didn't realize it, but Quackle likes AINS better than AIRS, and so does the Superleaves file, and also that new Leaves thing that O'Laugh posted to CGP. Personally I like BRO though, which is simming about the same w/ NOB but a point behind ROB. BRO basically leaves this whole quadrant dead to bingos, right? Dunno what would make ROB preferable to BRO. What do you think, ROB, BRO, NOB, something else?
>Comp: ?AAEMNR 5D RAMENtA +71 145
>Sam: AAAILRS 6E AA +12 173
#note Ugh I see SALARIAL(*?) 3E, and of course have no idea if that's good or not. REVENUAL is good...I'm not gonna play that, I've been playing too many phonies, and this is a bad time to lose a turn. I sort of like AA 6E for 12, isn't great for the board but I have column N, row 11, a few possibilities for eights. If he wants to score he's almost certainly going to have to open. ... Quackle likes ALA 4D a little more (1 pt) than my play. That seems right, I dunno if I considered it. Adds an additional (tho hard to manage) line atop it on row 3. Might as well take those 4 points I think. Not sure of course though.

>Sam: EEGNOUW 2E OW +28 277
#note Goddammit, I COMPLETELY forgot about the hook! Went back and simmed it and of course VARIOLES is better, but I should not be forgetting OVARIOLES. I hope I would have found it had he played elsewhere...anyway, this rack. Not much doing here. Just OW 2E, take points and move on? That's what I'm leaning towards. ... WOW, PHOTOGENE A1! Should have looked for extensions, but would not have known it anyway.
>Comp: EIIINPS B2 I.IES +32 264
>Sam: EEEGNNU A6 ENG +14 291
#note Ugh, my lead dwindles further and Comp may has another S, though not necessarily. I could do something lame like ENG A6, which is 14 and keeps a supershitty leave of EENU. Wish EUGE wasn't # right now (learned that from some CGP post yesterday lol, it's 100% a Latin word). Have the G for 11E but can't do much there either, except for ENG 16 I suppose. The good news is there is a ridiculous V/C ratio of 9/23. ENG is so ugly but I should be able to recover given that pool. The question is, A6 or 11C? I'll go A6, seems he'll have good comebacks after 11C esp. w/ many scorers out. ... Sim likes INGENUE J8, which seems unplayable given IVIES. It does prefer 11C ENG though, only by a point but still. It still seems a little too risky for me for just 2 points. Thoughts?
>Comp: ADFIINP 11C FID +22 286
>Sam: EELNTUW C7 TEEN.UL +24 315
#note Some options: TEENFUL is 24 keeping W, WEET or WEEN are 31 keeping LNU/LTU. The pool is still consonant-heavy, 18/8 C/V. I'm really unsure about what to do here. There's still bingo lanes for S-hooks at 12E or N7. Part of me thinks I should just take the points and outrun, but I also think WEEN/WEET gives easy points to the triple. I'm going to go with TEENFUL for turnover, trying to get an important S, and because LNU/LTU seems like it could be headed for trouble. ... The sim unambiguously likes WEET. Hmph.

#note Gulp...up 48, but talk about an unseen pool! AEGINRST. I definitely HAVE to block the S. Unfortunately, N7 means if he has the S, he has two spots to bingo. Could I be drawing dead here? ...Okay it's 7:00 PM during the Super Bowl, we have a huge party so I had to put this down for a long while, but I'm going to the bathroom so figured I might as well play. After thinking a lot about it I came up with CUBISM 15E. This puts me up by 84. Don't really have time to go through anything but I know I have to block the S. I now see I lose even if S is in bag (TWANGIER) but hopefully there's a winning sequence. ... Champ. Player likes CUBISM too.
