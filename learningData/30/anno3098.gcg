#note ODAH is better. Couldn't find plays overlapping YEP :-(.

#note She didn't know OUPHE.

#note Somehow didn't realize WRICK played at 4I, despite seeing WRICK and REX. Didn't kno WRICKED or DICKER and wasn't sure about WICKED.

#note DUDE! I totally thought this was good. FIB 11J sims better.

#note Stupid miss of BRAIL here. Quackle likes ALB B1 best. Hmm. I guess I like it-opens up a decent spot which your opponent can't play at with 6 or more letters starting with A, so gives me good bingo chances.

#note I love VINEAL a lot in this situation. Unfortunately, I didn't know it. She OBVIOUSLY has a great rack with an S, and VINEAL really shuts down the board-and makes it hard to open. It had a great chance of winning, I think.
>Polly_Moyer: OZ 10M .ZO +32 264
>Noah: AINOORT 2L ORT +23 316
#note This is an awful play I think. I don't know what was going through my head when I declined V plays-they make most of her bingos score less, and, in this case, would have nullified any bingos she had at all. This is clearly a game losing play.

#note Unfortunately, I had underscored ADJUSTEr by 18 at the beginning of the game, an error we didn't correct until the end. Therefore, I made this desperation RONION setup, hoping for a bingo. Quackle's favorite is SNOOK F1, which I agree with.
>Polly_Moyer: AMN 14D NAM +23 390
>Noah: AEGGORU C10 GRUE +16 372
#note This is a bad play. That's because I didn't think GONION was a word. I was pretty sure it was only GONIUM. Schucks. GOUGER C8 is better by 9 points.
>Polly_Moyer: AGMNRS 12B G.M +20 410
#note Wasn't sure of GRUM.
