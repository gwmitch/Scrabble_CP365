#note Immediately after this play, Augie invoked rule II.P.  Actually, I see it's now IV.L. in the rulebook, but it will always be II.P. in our hearts, minds, and bladders.  Because the only working bathroom was at a nearby deli, he was gone for five minutes.  Fortunately, he's a fast player and didn't miss the time too much.

#note Augie first laid this down as HEUAME, and I really thought he was going to give me a free turn.  Then he wrote down both spellings on his scoresheet, corrected the tiles, and pressed his clock.
