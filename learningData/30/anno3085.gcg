#note I forgot the TWINY spot.  DAMn.  When Jerry pointed that out after the game, I saw URALITE in half a second.  And it would have been a fun race to put an R on the front.

>Eugene_d'Eon: ABLNNTT D4 BA.T +12 391
#note no way to win.  I saw his GERON(T)IC immediately.  But more good advice post game.  If the only way to win is that he doesn't find it, then play BATT, TWINY for 38.  Good lesson.
