>Jan_Dixon: EHITW 8D WHITE +30 30
>Jason_Keller: CEEORSV F4 REVO.CES +73 73
#note CORVEES plays in two places on column I, but "Mr. Eight Thousand Sevens" doesn't know this one.  This is Q's next choice.
>Jan_Dixon: DEGLNNR H1 rOUSALB. +80 110
>Jan_Dixon: DEGLNNR --  -80 30
#note Jan put down ABL(E), took it off, and laid this down, meaning to lay down rOUSABLE*.  Good challenge.
>Jason_Keller: AEOQRVX G3 VEX +28 101
#note Q likes I7 ARVO.  I wanted to block what I thought was the most dangerous line.  Jan could have hit ABsOLUTE there, but I didn't realize she could have double-doubled next turn with BUSLOAdS.
>Jan_Dixon: BLO E3 BOL +33 63
#note I was perplexed by the lack of a bingo on this turn, phony 3 or not.
>Jason_Keller: AIOOQRY 11D QI. +24 125
#note I did this automatically.  Second to I7 OY.
>Jan_Dixon: AU D11 .UA +24 87
#note Still no bingo.
>Jason_Keller: AAHOORY 14B RAYA +30 155
#note Lay down the H, too!  Twenty-four point mistake.
>Jan_Dixon: ?EIMRSU 15E MISRUlE +78 165
>Jason_Keller: ACHINOO I5 CHINO +24 179
#note Duck likes C13 H(A)O, I like the next pick of 2B ACHOO myself.  This is off.  I laid down ANCHO at 14J and picked it up, realizing at least that this was a better idea, though not great.
>Jan_Dixon: GNOT 13C T.NGO +23 188
>Jason_Keller: ADIIKOZ D4 KI +39 218
#note "Finally that spot gets used," Jan said.  I prefer this to D2 KADI and D4 KID, which finish slighltly ahead on sim.
>Jan_Dixon: EPR 15A REP +22 210
>Jason_Keller: ADILOUZ L10 OZALID +48 266
#note Was happy to draw an L, and to find this spot.  I scored this as 46 instead of 48.
>Jan_Dixon: BOO 11J BO.O +30 240
>Jason_Keller: ADEEJNU 6B JUN +33 299
>Jan_Dixon: ?AEGIRS N9 GASsIER +84 324
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason_Keller: ADEENTT 3G .ENDETTA +76 375
#note I was thinking, gee, I'm so close to ATTENDEE here, but there's no E.  Then I saw this.  Only bingo.
>Jan_Dixon: ADELT 2K DEALT +23 347
>Jason_Keller: EILMRSU K2 ..MUR +16 391
#note I told Jan after the game that this was my rack following VENDETTA.  If only she hadn't blocked the O column.  This is best in win percentage, and I felt that if there was any chance of Jan bingoing, this play pretty much killed it.
>Jan_Dixon: AENOPWY H1 WY. +27 374
>Jason_Keller: AEFILST L1 F..A +30 421
#note CP gives me the thumbs up here. :)
>Jan_Dixon: DGINO O5 DINGO +24 398
>Jason_Keller: EEILNST J6 ENS +28 449
#note O12 ISLE setting up 7H N(I)TE is a little better for spread's sake. 
>Jan_Dixon: AFP N6 PA +22 420
#note Jan is low on time here, but I have three different places to play out.
>Jason_Keller: EILT 12G LITE +11 460
#note A little bit of a shaky start, but I got it together, with some help from the tiles. Reported as 466-420.
>Jason_Keller:  (F) +8 468
