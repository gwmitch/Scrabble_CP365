#note Q slightly prefers DELiMES. (-0.8)
>Jeff_Clark: ACDERST E5 CASTER.D +72 83
#note Like I said, thought RECASTED* was good and thought this looked familiar, so didn't even hold. No bingos playable.
>Jason: ?EQUVXY 9C QU.Y +26 120
#note If I challenge off CASTERED*, play QUEY at 10B for 45, I'm up 128 with the case blank. Instead, it takes me another 40 minutes to win this game. Q prefers QUbY(T)E (cute!) and (S)UQ to this. (-0.9)

#note OK, now we start putting this one away...
>Jeff_Clark: AAEIOTZ N10 ZEATI. +70 252
#note Guess not. Owie.
>Jason: HINORUU 4K HOURI +29 321
#note After this play, Jeff said "You're a gutsy boy" or something to that effect. But it scores the most, clears drek. It's highly unlikely he'll bingo after playing five and highly unlikely he'll hit both triples. Q agrees.
>Jeff_Clark: AABIOOT O6 BIOTA +32 284
>Jason: AILNOSU N2 NO.IA +20 341
#note UNISO(N)AL? Hmph. At least this is the best non-bingo play. (-47.8)
>Jeff_Clark: AGHKNNO 3M N.H +21 305
>Jason: AALNOSU I2 LAU.A +6 347
#note I remember taking like 5-10 minutes here. I finally saw the RAJ or TAJ for 44 potential at 4F and felt like I had to block, but I had nothing to do it with. But LAUA(N), which I didn't know, plays off the same tiles and scores four more. (-4.4)
>Jeff_Clark: AEGJKNO F2 JO +27 332
>Jason: CMNOORS O12 MO +16 363
#note CP's clear favorite is the counterintuitive RO(A)M, winning 99+% compared to 85.3% for this. But this leads valuation in sim.
>Jeff_Clark: AEGKNOT M6 TANK +19 351
#note Duck says Jeff has no wins here.
>Jason: CENORRS 7C RO.ES +26 389
#note CR(AM) first is 12 better. As is CRE(AM) and NOS(HE)R.
>Jeff_Clark: EGOW 11L GE. +4 355
#note Correct to block CRAM, but Q says to do it playing OG(AM).
>Jason: CNR D11 ..RC +8 397
>Jeff_Clark: OW J2 OW +16 371
#note Sorry, Jeff. You definitely played better.
>Jeff_Clark:  (N) +2 373
