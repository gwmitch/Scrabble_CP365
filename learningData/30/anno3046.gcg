>Jason: EGKLNNY 8G KEY +20 20
#note Missing YELK. (-6.1)
>Matt_Robin: AERW 9F WARE +24 24
>Jason: GLLLLNN -GLLLLN +0 20
#note FYI, odds of pulling LLL when you have an L with 93 tiles unseen: 1 in 31*46*91. No complaints, though; a lot of draws lead to an exchange and I should've seen YELK on the opening rack. Q wants me to keep GLN? Zuh? Keeping GN (which I considered) and L also rank ahead of this. (-1.7)
>Matt_Robin: IORT 10D RIOT +20 44
>Jason: AGNNOPR 11G APRON +22 42
#note Q likes PAN at 11F. PRONG at 7I and PA(I)N come in close behind. (-5.4)
>Matt_Robin: CIOU D8 CU.IO +20 64
>Jason: ACDGNPT 7I PANG +21 63
#note Whiffed on PACT, 12J. (-4.9)
>Matt_Robin: DINT 10J DINT +18 82
#note He doesn't have the vowels?
>Jason: CDFLNST 11C D.F +24 87
#note Remember seeing FL(I)T ... should've played it. (-0.5)
>Matt_Robin: AEINX M3 XENIA +35 117
>Jason: ACLNSTV L1 CLAN +31 118
#note Missed LAV/(XENIA)L. But this would work out. (-1.4)
>Matt_Robin: AJR K3 RAJ +33 150
>Jason: EMQSTUV 8M SUQ +49 167
#note Two big advantages to this play (in addition to the fact that's it's obvious): 1. I get to leave a vowel!
>Matt_Robin: ABBY -  +0 150
#note 2) He insta-challenged. Later said he thought it was only the -L back hook.
>Jason: EELMNTV 1L .ELT +18 185
#note Took a long time on this play ... glad it sims best.
>Matt_Robin: ABBY M10 .ABBY +24 174
#note Again, how does he not have vowel-itis?
>Jason: EGMNOSV 14L G.VE +22 207
#note Another play I took a while on. Again Q agrees.
>Matt_Robin: DDI O12 DI.D +24 198
#note In the post-mortem, Matt said this left him with four vowels.
>Jason: MNORSST H11 .ROMS +30 237
#note Leads in valuation, but M(A)S at J6 leads in win percentage.
>Matt_Robin: EHO G13 HOE +25 223
>Jason: ?HINSTU 8A HUI. +27 264
#note Nice to get the blank here ... although given Matt's recent plays, I knew his leaves probably weren't great (esp. since he was closing the board while behind). Little did I know I'd pick up the case blank and case S later, giving me all six of them for the game.
>Matt_Robin: EE I11 .EE +13 236
>Jason: ?ELNOST A8 .OLSTEiN +83 347
#note Or (H)ONESTLy. (-0.1)
>Matt_Robin: EMO B6 MO.E +14 250
>Jason: ?AFGIIW B14 FA +20 367
#note Q likes WIF(ES). (-15.6)
>Matt_Robin: Z J6 Z. +31 281
>Jason: ?GIIOSW N11 WO +16 383
#note Q likes the C5 placement. Makes sense. (-0.5)
>Matt_Robin: IT 9N TI +15 296
>Jason: ?EGIILS A1 SInGLE +28 411
#note GIrLIE is best, keeping the S for (KEY)S/(ZA)S. (-17.0)
>Matt_Robin: AERTUV C3 RAVE +19 315
#note VERTU or TRAVE instead.
>Jason: I N1 .I +4 415
#note Weird game. Felt like even with the clunky draws that ??SSSS should've led to a bigger win than 104. Wondered if I wasn't sharp ... glad Q told me I played it well.
>Jason:  (TU) +4 419
