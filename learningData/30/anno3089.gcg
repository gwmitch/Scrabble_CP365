#note If I'm trailing, I might play VETO here, but with the lead and both blanks unseen, I want to speed up the game.  It's a close call, though, because this play does open up a nice spot for him.

#note I really had no idea if this was good, but it seemed reasonable.  I thought Rod might think the same thing.  The best legit play is LEVEES 1J.
>Iceman: DIORTT M8 DI.TORT +18 284
#note Smart playing by Ice.  Getting to the blanks and prying the board open are more important than holding onto a few low point tiles.
>Jiggy: EFINOPR J5 OF +34 379
#note In some ways it seems better to turn over more tiles and try to block the lower right part of the board.  But most of my good scoring plays down there open things instead of closing them. (e.g., FORTE or PINTO 14J) My play scores well and gives me a good chance to bingo.  It also ensures that he must use a blank as an S in order for his bingo to hit a TWS.

>Jiggy: EINNPQR C9 PIN.ER +26 405
#note The Q put a damper on my plans, but I liked this play to score well, get to the end of the game quickly, partially block rows 14 and 15, and set up the Q.  If I can draw a blank or the last I now, I will easily outrun a bingo.
>Iceman: ?AILORY 14F .ORmALI.Y +76 381
#note A gorgeous find.  Considering the high probability that I had the other blank, I can't criticize him at all for playing it.  But as we talked about after the game, knowing the blank is in the bag, he might have a better chance to win with something like TODAY 8K.  If he could infer from PINCER that I was probably holding the Q, he might have been able to reason that if I have the blank, he's lost anyway.  So then it would make sense to defer bingoing on the basis that drawing the second blank might be his only chance to win.  But he was short of time, and this play combined with a very nice final draw made me sweat it out...
>Jiggy: BEGGNQU 10B Q. +31 436
#note Awkward situation for me here, but I have just enough to outrun him.  Notice that it's not a good idea to hang onto the Q and take out his high scoring spot with BERG H12, because he scores nearly as much with sAW 15M.
