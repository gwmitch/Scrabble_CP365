>Mason_Shambach: INY 7G YIN +22 22
>Jason: ?EFQRVZ F8 .EZ +32 72
#note Q says to exchange FQV. (-2.1)
>Mason_Shambach: HLNPUWY G7 ..H +22 44
>Jason: ?EFQRTV H6 Q.. +12 84
#note I put this down, realized an exchange was better, and hit my clock anyway. Argh! Q says to exchange QV. (-3.0)
>Mason_Shambach: AEIKLR D8 .ARLIKE +36 80
>Mason_Shambach: AEIKLR --  -36 44
#note Held almost a minute. In the end, decided to trust my instincts and they were right.
>Jason: ?EFRTUV 10C FUT. +16 100
#note Holy FRi(JOLES)! But this is best.
>Mason_Shambach: AEIKLR C10 .LAK +22 66
>Jason: ?EIOORV 12A OV.RIOlE +74 174
#note There was a prize for best ORTONVILLE word (using the most letters therein) and Matt Robin and I discussed the possibility of eight with OVERTOIL, so when I saw this rack I thought "throw the L where I can use it, Mason." But this sufficed.
>Mason_Shambach: EORY 14B OYER +29 95
>Jason: AEENNTT 15D NEATEN +26 200
#note Sims a touch better than TENANT.
>Mason_Shambach: INV E5 VIN. +14 109
>Jason: DEEISTU 6H .UID +18 218
#note Put this down, picked it up, put it down again. Given the circumstances, should've played QUIETED (which I considered). Ends the game faster, blah blah blah. That leads in wins, (J)E(U) in valuation. (-3.3) 
>Mason_Shambach: ILOR 5I ROIL +19 128
>Jason: AEESTTU D6 TA. +14 232
#note Mediocre play. (J)E(U) is preferred. (-12.0)
>Mason_Shambach: ?DEENRR J9 RENDERs +67 195
>Jason: EEESTUU -EEUU +0 232
#note Something tells me this game won't be as easy as I anticipated...
>Mason_Shambach: ABP 4K BAP +24 219
>Jason: AEGIOST 3L GO +18 250
>Mason_Shambach: MM 2M MM +19 238
>Jason: AACEIST 1N AI +10 260
#note T(OYER) is good? Hmph. C(O)ATI, A11. (-11.5)
>Mason_Shambach: GO A11 G.O +4 242
>Jason: ACDESTW 13F WAD +18 278
#note Tough call. Plays are so bunched, and he was short on time so I wanted to play quickly. Giving Mason an S, Q likes WA(N) at I13 and so do I. (-2.3)
>Mason_Shambach: EHILRST N4 SLITHER +72 314
>Jason: CESTUWX O8 EX +51 329
#note OK, I think we can safely give up on bingoing... Missed WEC(H)T. I think I've seen that one before, but couldn't think of it over the board. (-7.3)
>Mason_Shambach: APT M6 PAT +19 333
>Jason: CEISTUW 11H WI.CE +27 356
#note A good game to make the right pre-endgame play. TU(N)IC, same spot, is close.
>Mason_Shambach: AFGN 12L FANG +30 363
#note I wanted that F for (GOO)FS/F(OYER)...
>Jason: ADIOSTU 14J .ADIOS +14 370
#note CP is being silly. It says (R)ADIUS and A(R)ISTO are my only wins, but the endgame sequence after this and RADIUS are basically the same. Tough to see the guaranteed out-in-two on this board.
>Mason_Shambach: BCESU 7L B..S +16 379
#note Didn't know BUS(TI)C, which is 10 better. Mason had 11 seconds left after FANG, though.
>Jason: TU O12 .U.T +15 385
#note Kind of disturbing to lose a lead of 91 on turn, but I'm glad to see I played it pretty well.
>Jason:  (CEU) +10 395
