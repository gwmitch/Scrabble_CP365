#note I wasn't bright enough to find the best play here.  I considered WIZ, but I thought it might block the board up too much for my bingos.

#note There is a better bingo, but it's a tricky find.

#note I was disappointed that my previous play had taken out the E, but after the game Dan told me I had also blocked a bingo for him.

#note I think this move gives me the best chance to come back.  I simultaneously open two bingo lines and give myself a good chance to draw an A so that I can use one of them.  I also might deke him into trying PREFED* or playing to block it if he doesn't have the P.  The fact that this word is also my highest scoring play is a bonus.

>Dave: ADGGLNS 12A GANGS +29 334
#note Maybe I can get very lucky and draw a bingo that fits in two places.  This seemed better than GLADS with all those N's unseen.  I might have tried LADS if it didn't keep a duplicate G.
