>Matt_Silver: ETWY 7H WYTE +20 42
>Sam: AADFNUY L4 YAUD +28 57
#note Spent a while looking for a five but still choked on FAUNA 8K. YAUD isn't horrible, but I don't see any reason not to take the points. FAUNA 10B is worth considering, but I don't see much of a reason for that over 8K, other than perhaps keeping the D for WYTED.

>Sam: ABFKNWX 10I FAWN +17 74
#note The sim likes FA H4. The upside to that is that Matt doesn't really have anything to do after it. The downside is BKNWX, and I don't have anything to do either. I like playing off some tiles here and working away from this crap.

>Matt_Silver: ?EINPRS 2B uPRISEN +74 184
#note I'm guessing Matt missed the WHOMP hook--never got a chance to use it myself, unfortunately. I forget if he said he missed it or forwent it when I pointed it out after the game. Regardless, NIPpERS 14H looks best to me.
>Sam: ?LOOTVV M3 VOLT +34 148

>Sam: ?ILNOOV 4D VIOL +29 177
#note Hated what this did to the board, but what else am I going to play? MOON? RENVOI? ZOO? I think this is forced. There's still N6, and I can always open next turn.
>Matt_Silver: AERR E1 A.R.ER +18 225
#note Or Matt can open two more lanes for me.
>Sam: ?ENNORS 13K .ON +14 191
#note Believe it or not, no bingos play here. Maybe I should have tried MORN here? I feel like there's not much difference.

>Matt_Silver: ACO 10D OCA +20 277
>Sam: GHILNOT C8 HOLTING +80 351
#note THOLING--duh! I know THOLE, so that's logical. This is a phony, Matt didn't hold thankfuly.
>Matt_Silver: AEU B13 EAU +14 291
>Sam: AEEGIMR A12 EM +10 361
#note Champ. Player likes AM D7. One play Quackle points out is EM B8, which forces him to FAIREST or TIRADES on row 15. That looks like a good play, although it sacrifices some spread w/ the FEH hook. Suggestions welcome here. My play looks pretty week, leaving A3 and row 15.

#note TIGER 15H is nine points better, planning to score and go out off Matt's SAFARI.
