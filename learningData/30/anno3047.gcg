>Winter: BGHIMRT 8H BRIGHT +32 32
>Jason: FILOORY 8H ......LY +51 51
#note Ooh, Winter, who already entered the game in a foul mood having started 0-2, was not happy here. "That's the kind of luck I've had all day," he lamented.
>Winter: EMOPRTZ N8 .EZ +32 64
>Jason: FINOORS K8 .OOF +16 67
#note ROOFIN(G)S is good! Dammit, I doubted it. Costly miss, as you'll see. (-45.1)
>Winter: JMOPRTW J10 JOW +59 123
#note "Finally!" Winter said as he put this down. Hmph.
>Jason: AEEINRS 10J ..E +10 77
#note Q wants me to take the extra eight points and add the I for (H)IE. (-2.3)
>Winter: DDLMPRT -DDMPR +0 123
>Jason: AEIINRS H8 .INARIES +83 160
>Winter: ?HLRTUV 13J LUV +20 143
>Jason: EIIMNVW I4 WIVE.N +17 177
#note Don't know why I passed on WIVE(R) at 12D. Neither does Q. (-9.8)
>Winter: ?BHNPRT 5H B.RTH +20 163
>Jason: IIILMST 11D MILI. +14 191
#note Didn't know/wouldn't have seen MISLI(T), M3. (-5.9)
>Winter: ?ADDNPR 14B PANDeR.D +72 235
>Jason: AEIQSST 15A QI +37 228
#note Debated about adding the S. But with that semi-juicy LUV hook open (and the potential for a column C play next turn hooking it to QI), didn't think it was worth it. Q disagrees. (-4.0)
>Winter: EEEKLSU 13C KUE +31 266
>Jason: AAENSST H3 TA. +12 240
#note FPS. Have GOT to stop making plays where I know it's a bad play as I'm putting it down. ANSATE at O10, which I considered, is the play. (-10.9)
>Winter: AEEELRS 2C RELEASE +65 331
#note Again, whacked for my mistake.
>Jason: AENNOSS M11 NOS +20 260
#note Q prefers SAN(T)O, M5. (-0.7)
>Winter: ADEEFNO 1A DEAFEN +57 388
#note Owie.
>Jason: ?ADENST A1 .ANDiEST +83 343
#note Setting up a potential X-bomb. I'm not dead yet. Ahead of uNSTEAD(Y), highest-scoring play, in win percentage. (-4.0)
>Winter: AAGMOOX 4L OGAM +30 418
>Jason: EGIIRTT O1 GRI. +21 364
#note CP likes (M)IG or (V)IG. Playing for the bingo? I'm playing for the X-bomb, with a bingo as plan B. Although, I did kill the best lane ... prolly should've left both open, as he can hit them both. (-3.0)
>Winter: ACOOOPX 10B COAX +32 450
#note Did his usual "put the play on the board, then look at it for about 15 minutes". Eventually he hit his clock.
>Jason: AEITTUY 7A .ATIETY +15 379
#note TUYE(R) is 12 better. This was the only guaranteed out in two I saw.
>Winter: COOPU E4 PUC. +16 466
#note COPE makes my out eight instead of six.
>Jason: U 4D U. +8 387
#note If I'd played ROOFIN(G)S, if I hadn't played TA(B) ... if, if, if.
>Jason:  (OO) +4 391
