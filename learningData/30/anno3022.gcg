#note Not enough comp. battery to sim this for more than 1,090 iterations. STUPA, SPUTA and SCAUP seem to be bunched up near the top, along with SCUP and my SCUT. At least I picked the right spot, haha. Didn't know SCAUP, that seems right though. Why give him the freebie 6F w/ SPUTA, STUPA (didn't know these words btw, but we had a conversation at some point during the day about them, forget if it was before or after this game). I guess SCUP is worth it for the 4 points?

#note Held for a long time, but released.
>Sam: ?AAILPT M2 LAPIdAT. +70 145
#note Looked at AAILPST for a long time :( I even saw PARTIAL and couldn't find it. It's harder when you don't know if there's a solution. I wish I'd quizzed it before, my goal is to one day have every word "memorized" by alphagram and take the sometimes-on, sometimes-off anagramming like this out of the equation. I feel dumb for missing sPATIAL.
>Seth_Lipkin: GINRSTU O7 RUSTING +91 215
#note Again held for a long time. Sam: "You're a jerk!" Seth: "Director!!!"

#note I thought Seth didn't know RUSTINGS*--I thought it was good, and that'll greatly influence my later plays. EvASIVE, an extremely tough find, scores three more.
>Sam: AENRSUZ D11 AZURE +35 347
#note Quackle wants me to play the waiting game with ZA 5I on this board. There is literally nowhere to bingo (no Is left). Given RUSTINGS*, isn't this best?
>Seth_Lipkin: EFLR 15A FLE.R +24 405
>Sam: DEEGNOS C9 .OG +18 365
#note Champ. Player likes NOGG 13L, which sort-of sets up two bingo lanes, but both can basically be blocked, especially with KV out for a good block. My play's in fifth. Remember, I think RUSTINGS* might be good, so I'm also playing to that. There's probably something better I"m missing here, I'm sort of rushing through this.
>Seth_Lipkin: ELNNOPT 13B LO.PEN +18 423
#note Held for an extremely long time, but in the back of my head I knew it.
>Sam: BDEENSV 2D BE +9 374
#note I thought I was going out next turn...this pisses away 23 points.
>Seth_Lipkin: EKNT K4 KE.T +25 448
#note KEN K4 or HANT 3L are 6 points better.
>Sam: DENSV 14K VENDS +27 401

#note D'oh
>Seth_Lipkin: N O1 ..N +6 454
#note I saw his cooler out of GIRON 1G, and felt like a total jerk pointing it out after he kicked my butt. Well played, Seth.
