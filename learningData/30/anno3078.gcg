#note Before beginning the game, Lisa said "I'd really appreciate if I could win this one, because I've got a six-hour drive home and it'll be a much better ride if I win."  I told her the same thing was true with 30-minute drives home, so I was going to try to win anyway.

#note Worth a bit more hooking FAUNA.
>George_Viebranz: EEIOSTT I6 TOE +13 65
#note Best, surprisingly.  
>Lisa_Slankard: IKNR 13C R.INK +28 81
#note One of my favorite 4-to-make-5s.

>Lisa_Slankard: BGOO 2B GOBO +25 190
>George_Viebranz: ?CIIMVV K8 CIVI. +24 166
#note The first thing I thought when I looked at this rack was not, "This rack is horrible."  It was, "What a weird rack."

#note It's worth more points the other way, but if that lane closes down, a few points won't be worth anything to me.  
>Lisa_Slankard: AOQTU B7 QUOTA +32 278
#note I thought this was a pretty nice fit.  
>George_Viebranz: ??ELRSV 15H .eLiVERS +92 287
#note The only bingo that gives me a chance, I think.
>Lisa_Slankard: APTU 8K .APUT +30 308
#note I didn't remember this one, and it blocked my bingo.  Plus, if I didn't challenge, I had no idea what the hell else I was going to do.

>George_Viebranz: AEEEGLT M13 GE. +8 295
#note Lisa's LUNG doesn't block -ATE or -ITE bingoes.  She later told me that she wasn't trying to shut the lane down, she just didn't have any vowels.
>Lisa_Slankard: X 8A X. +27 344
>George_Viebranz: AEEILOT O2 ETIOLA.E +63 358
#note After this one, Lisa said "That should do it."  I didn't know what she was talking about.  She had what she needed to seal it up.  
>Lisa_Slankard: AENNORY N2 YEAN +30 374
>George_Viebranz: SY 1H .Y +7 365
#note I was so close to hopeless here.  I had completely forgotten about SYN, which ties.  I don't give a shit about conserving spread.  If I go out, I definitely don't win, and it's not like I have something important to do before the prize ceremony.  Lisa is under 2 minutes.  My only chance is to block her out and hope she makes a mistake.  This is highly unlikely, but it's all I've got to cling to.  
>Lisa_Slankard: NOR G10 OR +17 391
#note I didn't see RO(A)N until after I hit the clock.  ON K5 wins too.  
>Lisa_Slankard: NOR --  -17 374
#note I guess I've blown enough games in the past that I shouldn't feel guilty for winning this one.  It made me think I should take more risks in the face of certain loss and not worry so much about a few spread points.
