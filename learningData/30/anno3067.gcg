>Unsexy: EIRTUUV 8D VIRTUE +26 26
#note JI: Briefly considered holding back the E, but this is preferred.
>Sexy: EEISSTY J6 YES +24 24
#note JK: Wins my 3-ply sim, but I7 YE is close, and I can see why it's preferrable.
>Unsexy: AGIRTUV 5H VIRTU +23 49
#note JI: Close call. This, VAGI, VATU, VIRGA ... all within two points of each other. Stylistic, and I couldn't resist opening with VIRTUE and VIRTU.
>Sexy: AEIIOST D8 .IE +6 30
#note JK: I looked at this rack, said "What do I do?" to myself, and promptly proceeded to muck this badly.  I even said something about playing IOTA but missed spots for it.  Unsexy claims to have given me the Dackman treatment on this, but I think there had to be more seething rage coming from the other side in that case.
>Unsexy: AFGINNN 7I F.IGN +23 72
#note JI: Having overestimated his leave, I'm trying to make bingos harder, although I didn't really do that. Duck likes F(E)N about 10 better ... not sure it's that much better, but probably better than this. If I want to go the turnover/muck up the board route, F(I)NNING or F(U)NNING are better options.
>Sexy: AIIOSTW C10 WAIT +19 49
#note JK: Looking at this post-mortem, I said, "Why didn't I play this at 11D?"
>Unsexy: ?ABJNNW 11B J.WAN +40 112
#note JI: So, is it right to say the "no-brainers are fun," like I have in the past? (shrugs) Surely winning a game by playing GE(NE)RATEd is a lot more fun than making an obvious play like this. It's just kind of nice ... every rack a potential mistake, I think I made the Q-approved play three times in 13 turns in this one. It's nice to be able to plop this down quickly and be 99+% certain it's the best play. "Fun" maybe isn't an accurate word.
>Sexy: AEEIOSS M4 AEO. +13 62
#note JK: The other plays that are slightly better all involve me playing an S.  ISC might be handing me a severe case of vowelitis with anything other than M3 EOSI(N)E, but I like keeping a balanced leave here.
>Unsexy: ?ABHLNO L2 HAB. +26 138
#note JI: Missing HOBNAiL, but since Mr. "I know my top 8,000 sevens" didn't know it, I don't feel badly about missing it. Better non-bingo options are H(U)N(G) or B(U)N(G). About a 15-point error. 
#note JK: It's going in the cardbox soon.
>Sexy: EEILRSS 14A RESILES +76 138
#note JK: A bit better than the eight that plays for the same score.
>Unsexy: ?CILNOO A12 CO.N +27 165
#note JI: Two turns, two bingo misses. But again, Mr. "8,000 sevens" didn't know OrCINOL or LOCOINg so I'm not beating myself up. I might have been able to see uNICOLO(R), but I really have a hard time seeing eights when the tile to play through is in an awkward spot and there are other juicier spots. At least this is the best non-bingo and it's "only" a 20-point error. 
#note JK: For the record, it's actually 6,900 sevens at this point, plus some others that I haven't studied, but can spot.
>Sexy: DEEMOUX 2J EX.UME +40 178
#note JK: JI noted that this is a bit aggressive.  15G ODEUM sets up the X, and 15F DOUX is the other nice choice.
>Unsexy: ?AEILOP 1D PELOrIA +85 250
#note JI: Or OPALInE. Damn JK for throwing that E in the triple lane when I have four vowels!
>Sexy: BDEORYZ O1 Z.ROED +51 229
#note JK:  I felt that I needed to close the O column here.  JI likes doing it with D(E)BYE or D(E)RBY.  I also considered 15G OYEZ, but the duck likes 15F DOZY a bit better.
#note JI: Not me, the Duck. I probably would've played this or DOZY if I saw it. 
>Unsexy: GHNNQTT -GNNQT +0 250
#note JI: Well, since my fervent hope that he'd play along row 15 was dashed... sim seems to slightly prefer keeping just the H, but it's close. I don't see anything wrong with this exchange. 
#note JK: I don't either.
>Sexy: ?BLMRTY 9H MY +28 257
#note JK: Straightforward.
>Unsexy: ACDGHPT 15G HAP +29 279
#note JI: JK saw the two better options, HAG (better leave despite sacrificing the three points ... bad decision on my part) and PATCH at 13F, a play I never would've considered. We were quickly running out of scoring spots and I wanted to take the last good one. 
#note JK: JI is giving a little too much credit here.  He asked about HAG, but my instinct was to play PATCH.
>Sexy: ?BDGLRT E6 GR.D +9 266
#note JK: This is among a bunch of two-tile plays at E10.  I like giving myself the chance at an extra vowel.
>Unsexy: CDGNOOT D1 .ONG +14 293
#note JI: I actually typed DONG in at 12E, then wanted the extra point for this ... like that P spot is so juicy and has to be taken out. Bzzt! DONG sims like four better than anything else, I think it was like 6-8 better than this.
>Sexy: ?ABLSTU 13G ABLaUTS +77 343
#note JK: Case in point from earlier.  This isn't a seven that I've studied.  It just happened to be part of the Teaneck flyer.  Even if I miss this, there are a few places to play SUBLATe and some other things, but this is best.
>Unsexy: CDENORT 3B CO.NED +22 315
#note JI: Well, I'm in deep soup now. The eternal question, play for the bingo or try to run? I'm half right here, as Q says to run ... but with CR(O)TON at 2B! Didn't know that one. CP's next two picks play for the bingo: (a)D or D(ASH) each win about 8-9%. Zuh? I do that, JK plays through the N and where in heck do I bingo? I think CR(O)TON's the only play.
>Sexy: AAKLNQT J10 QAN.T +35 378
#note JK: I thought this was pretty obvious, though CP says to go with B3 (C)ALK.
#note JI: CP is on crack. He plays LACK or CALK and I take away this good Q spot. I think this is fairly obvious.
>Unsexy: DFIOORT K9 FID +31 346
#note JI: DIT, same spot, is five better. I made a comment like: "There must be a guaranteed out with ROOF that there isn't with ROOT" and while I'm looking for it, JK points out FOR(G)O. Nice. Dude's got skillz. 
#note JK: Now, if that could just be a more general consensus.
>Sexy: AEIKL B1 LI.K +20 398
#note JK: As someone else would say, "I'm 12 years old!  Look what I'm playing!  Hahahahaha!"  I was hoping that I might throw Unsexy off a little bit.  If I hadn't halved my age, maybe I would have seen 9K FLEA or 12L AE and blocked his out.
#note JI: In this instance, being a stinkeroo is a 10-point hit on spread. Make your best play, not the one that will cause your opponent to drool. And half your age is 13 1/2, oldster.
>Unsexy: OORT M9 ROOT. +6 352
#note JI: Well played from JK (except for VIE, but I already gave him enough grief about that). Out-bingo-missed 2-0, which usually leads to a loss. JK, you have my permission to kick everybody's arse in North Salem and Philly this weekend, except maybe Tangredi's. 
#note JK: Like I needed your permission to do that? :)
>Unsexy:  (AE) +4 356
