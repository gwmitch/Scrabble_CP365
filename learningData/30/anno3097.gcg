#note Missed several bingos in spots I looked at. Did't know PENSTOcK or UPSTrOKE. I also mise the beautiful dESKTOP which plays at K6 or K8.
>Chris_Mazucca: EMNORT H1 MENTO. +24 36
#note Missed TREMOr/TERMOr. I know she has an R because she but down MENORr first and then realized, oh wait.
>Noah: EFGRUWW M3 WEF. +20 99
#note Considered FRUGS, and apparently the EWW leave is signicantly better than GRUW. I didn't consider WRUNG 3E, which is apparently best. Exchanging FGUWW is also better I guess.

>Noah: DEIILOT 12H .ILTED +28 243
#note I didn't realize this play was that bad. DOCILE 1J is best apparently? Why is it so much better than this? IT can't really be 9 points better than IO, can it?

#note I misrecorded something-she did something else between this and the next play that I can't remember.
>Chris_Mazucca: AF N2 FA +16 216
#note She actually played this before YO, but it doesn't really matter, because it's essentialy the same and I don't want to reannotate it.

#note This is a bad play. It's partially because I don't realize there are three As in the pool. I track it as AADNORS? and something else that I don't know. Turns out there are four possible bingos through the C, and only one from the E! (hARDNOSE). Quackle says play SPRAG.
