>Pete: AIILNNT 8G LIN +6 6
#note Did not know ANILIN, wouldn't have played it if I did.  Why LIN over NIL?  Dunno, just felt like it would lead to a more open board.
>Winter: ADEOPSY I4 DYSP.OEA +68 68
>Pete: ABCINST 10D CABIN.TS +70 76
#note Only bingo, easy enough to find.
>Winter: AJRU H1 JURA +40 108
#note This is so far looking like the run-of-the-mill Me vs. Winter game... high scoring, and eventually coming down to him drawing more of the goodies than I do.  I our lifetime games, I've drawn 1 blank.  
>Pete: ABGPRST 5E PART. +32 108
#note GAB F6 win sim... hmm.  i'll take the points.
>Winter: DGGIMRT 12H UNRIG +29 137
>Winter: DGGIMRT --  -29 108
#note As soon as he played the bingo I knew this was coming.  I was pretty sure this word was S only, and I knew if it took another hook, it wasn't an N.  Had I never played Winter before, I may have let it go, but knowing the way he likes to play, and seeing the ugliness of his tiles, it was a relatively easy challenge.
>Pete: BGGIOTW 6D GIG +20 128
#note Big miss.  While I didn't know BAGWIG, My play is just kind of Panicky.  I didn't want to open the board with WIG there incase he was trying to bat me into apening a line for a seven.  WOT is the easy choice I should have seen.  BIGG kind of freaked me out.
>Winter: EGIRRU K4 GURRIE. +16 124
#note Held for a second, until I wrote out the alphagram and saw that I did indeed know the word.  
>Pete: BNOOQTW E9 Q.T +24 152
#note QAT beats WON 11E by a fraction.   I did consider exchanging just to try to regain some handle on my rack... I felt like I was swimming in concrete as my rack grew gloomier each turn.
>Winter: FINO L1 FINO +28 152
>Pete: ABMNOOW 1L .AWN +30 182
#note Best, but I almost played BOWMAN, just to start over. ABOON sims about  the same, but I was sick of the W.
>Winter: LLU D10 .ULL +14 166
>Pete: ABIMOOY M3 OY +21 203
#note I chickened out on BLOOMY.  OY was weak,
>Winter: DINR 8K .NDRI +21 187
>Pete: ABDEIMO 12G AMEBOID +95 298
>Pete: ABDEIMO --  -95 203
#note After the earlier adventure, I felt I had to try.  I knew it was no good... AE is a Latin ending, and the DYS and PN combo are both clear signs that it was a Greek word.  Saw both potential eights with the rack, but neither played.  I didn't see a good fish (missing BLIN/QI), and I wanted to try to end it here, and race for the ??SS available.  Didn't work, but I'd try it again in a second.
>Winter: ATV 2E VAT. +9 196
>Pete: ABDEIMO 13C B.AMED +24 227
#note Duck likes playing small, as I should have as well, with so many E's available.  BEAM C11 is an interesting choice.
>Winter: ADEZ N8 .AZED +35 231
#note Sheesh.
>Pete: AEIKOOX 7D OXO +29 256
#note My toughest rack of the game.  Torn between AXE o10 and OXO.  The more balanced rack, in my mind, is more important than the points, and his use of an hook to hit 8A would open another bingo line.  NOOKIE o1 is actually I really nice option as well.
>Winter: HMSU 8A HUMS +35 266
>Pete: AEEIKRT H13 .AK +24 280
#note EKED Kills.  My play, while first on the static evaluator, sucks.  I had no need to fear running out of Es.  
>Winter: VW F1 V.W +9 275
#note At this point, I've put him on both blanks.  I know I want an open board, so that if he bingoes, I have at least a chance to bingo back.
>Pete: EEEIORT 2N OE +16 296
#note Sheesh.  In pivotal situations like this against this opponent, I usually miss, and I don't understand why... it's like karma, if karma were the exact opposite of karma.  RETIE is interesting... but with both blanks out, I didn't think I had two turns to shut down the board, so I would have to bingo back still.
>Winter: ?EEEEOO 1H .EE +10 285
>Pete: EEEHIRT M7 E.H +21 317
#note I'm playing for the miracle here.  Fish off, hoping to draw a couple consonants to counter his almost certain bingo. HIED 12K wins sim and makes more sense.
>Winter: ??EILST 15H .ITtLESt +83 368
#note Of course.  But... if I drew at all well, I can still bingo back...
>Pete: EEEIORT J10 .EE +5 322
#note Of course, I missed entirely.  And then, out of frustration, I refuse to mentally process the fact that he emptied the bag, and try to fish.  OOPS.  It's so annoying to get bagged by someone over and over.
>Winter: CFINO M11 FIN +20 388
#note He doesn't block my out with FINCH, his best play.
>Pete: EIORT A8 .ERIOT +10 332
#note And out I go, after another painful game against him where nothing went right.  
>Pete:  (CO) +8 340
