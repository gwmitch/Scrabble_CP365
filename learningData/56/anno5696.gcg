>Jim_Burlant: AEIORTV 8D VIATORE +78 78
#note Whoops - this needs that little asterisk after it.  An honest mistake, as I confused this with the valid 8, VIATORES. Best legitimate play is 8F AVO 12.
>Jesse_Wornum: ACEIMO D8 .OMICAE +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: BEEJLLP J6 JE.P +29 107
#note Too bad I couldn't think of JEBEL.  This sims within 1 point of 7H JEBEL, the sim winner.
>Jesse_Wornum: QT 13C Q.T +24 52
>Jim_Burlant: ABELLOP K5 POL +21 128
#note Best, nothing else sims within 5 points of this.
>Jesse_Wornum: CFL 11B FL.C +18 70
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEELR L4 BEE +24 152
#note Best.
>Jesse_Wornum: GIRS M3 RIGS +31 101
>Jim_Burlant: AELMORR 12D .ORM +13 165
#note Quackle likes the more defensive posture of 9F ROM or 9F MOR; I don't.  I don't like the idea of shutting things down and turning the game into a slog when I have a good chance of drawing into another bingo that could break the game wide open.  Assuming I draw into one, this gives me another place to play it.
>Jesse_Wornum: DG 9C G.D +10 111
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLRST H3 LEGAT.RS +60 225
#note LARGEST 2G scores 8 more than this, but I felt the extra 8 points weren't worth the risk, given that Z?? were still unseen and that he had just fished.  Since LARGEST 2G could easily give him either a huge Z play at 1H or a bingo on row 1 for 90+, I felt this was the smarter play.  Quackle agrees - this choice wins the sim.  
>Jesse_Wornum: ?EINORS 13G ORIENtS +71 182
#note Jesse is still in the game here, though Quackle only gives him a 1-in-6 chance.  This is his best bingo according to the sim.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABHTTU 2K TUBA +20 245
#note Arrrrgh.  I thought there might be something in this rack but couldn't find any of the bingos (the 23000 probability BATHTUb and 16000 probability BUTTHEAd).  I knew TUBA was a dangerous play, but given the vowel-heavy  pool and my having the case blank, why not create lines for myself to score big within the next turn and put the game away?  As far as non-bingo options, 2J BATTU, 2M BUT, 7E BHUT sim best.
>Jesse_Wornum: DEOZ 1H DOZE +44 226
>Jim_Burlant: ?DHLNTY J12 H.Y +17 262
#note I figured he'd take either H1 or O1 out.  Now I'm in a bind, as this sure wasn't the draw I expected from a pool of 50% vowels.  Now I'm sweating that he doesn't burn me at O1, and big-time.  Quackle likes THEY J11 a lot more than this, presumably due to extra turnover as well as the fact that it's not creating another bingo line.
>Jesse_Wornum: ADIVW 4D WAIV.D +26 252
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADLNTX O1 fLAX +61 323
#note Initially annoyed when I saw the X, but I had to roll with the punches.   Definitely time to pull the plug on the blank - too many points available.  Interestingly, TAX 11J sims at a marginally higher valuation than this, though fLAX wins the sim on a win-percentage basis.
>Jesse_Wornum: HNO 5C NOH +27 279
>Jim_Burlant: AADIKNT 11J TANK +26 349
#note Quackle prefers a bunch of K plays at 6B, presumably for the extra points; I'd rather take out the most dangerous remaining bingo line and score 26 points to do it.  And any play he makes back-hooking TANK will almost certainly give me something back down the O column.  IMO it's ludicrous that this play sims so poorly.
>Jesse_Wornum: NTU 6B TUN +13 292
>Jim_Burlant: ADIINUY 7A DIN +11 360
#note His last play makes it obvious he's sitting on the S; with this board and this much of a lead, I'll gladly sacrifice leave and equity to guarantee myself the win. I chose this rather than YIN because, not knowing the dictionary with 100% recall, I didn't want to chance his hitting me with something that could play through  the Y.  I think we can safely disregard the sim results in this instance;  against a random rack Quackle prefers UNITY L10 and any other number of plays on the right side of the board that balance the rack and score better but leave the A column untouched where he can hit an easy ERASION to win the game.   Even when simming against an inferred rack of AEINORS, this play sims second, but Quackle still trashes it,  preferring N9 UNAI by 20 equity points.  Be serious.
>Jesse_Wornum: AESU 9J .AUSE +8 300
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIIUY 8M AYE +25 385
#note Now that's more like it; sim results here are much more indicative of reality than that last play, with any number of plays here simming best.
>Jesse_Wornum: EFINORW 10N WO +30 330
>Jim_Burlant: EIIU A7 .UI +12 397
#note Missed 12J HIE.  
>Jesse_Wornum: EFINR H13 .IF +18 348
#note We both got a chuckle when Jesse had put down ONFIRE* O10 but pulled it up. 
>Jim_Burlant: EI L13 .IE +3 400
#note Missing the much better 12J HIE 19.
>Jim_Burlant:  (ENR) +6 406
