>Nancee_Mancel: EHINY 8D HEINY +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: AEOORSW 7C WOO +17 17
#note I held HEINY*...and after thinking about it for 30 seconds convinced myself I must have seen it somewhere before.  Yeah, and I conveniently forgot that I'd seen it before because I'd played it and it had been challenged off the board.   Whoops!  Anyway - the 7E placement of WOO wins the sim - just barely. Sim results indicate it's it's pretty much a matter of personal preference as to where to put it down; they all sim roughly the same.
>Nancee_Mancel: DTZ F7 D.TZ +42 72
>Jim_Burlant: AERSTUX 7H AX +22 39
#note This sims 3rd best; sim winner is ZAX, with AX 9H simming just ahead of this choice.
>Nancee_Mancel: EIJV J4 JIVE +32 104
>Jim_Burlant: AEKRSTU 8J STREAK +48 87
#note Hmmm...Quackle says I should play 4J JAUK 30, keeping REST.  REST is certainly a powerful leave...but shouldn't I take 48 points, even if the leave is the rancid U?  The sim does not like this play at all, docking me almost 20 points for this play.  Maybe STRAKE is a little better, but is this really that bad of a play?
>Nancee_Mancel: HOT K3 HOT +25 129
>Jim_Burlant: MOPRSUU 4J ..RUM +28 115
#note Best.
>Nancee_Mancel: ER 6H RE. +21 150
>Jim_Burlant: GIOPQSU N6 QU.G +34 149
#note Yuck, non-existent board vision strikes again.  This is in the second tier of choices, though it understandably sims way below EQUIPS M8, which is the clear winner.  I was too fixated on holding my S and building a rack and not looking for the best play here.  This is a very bad miss.
>Nancee_Mancel: AAABDFI -AAABDF +0 150
>Jim_Burlant: BEILOPS O1 BOPS +43 192
#note The tile gods were giving me the chance to bail myself out from the previous miss...but I didn't know PREBOILS and the only thing I saw in this rack was BIPOLES*, which I was sure was phony.  This is the best non-bingo choice.  Even with all the mistakes - the phony I let go, the missed plays - I still look like I'm in good position here.  I still have a workable lead, SS?? are still unseen, and I'm turning enough tiles that I should be able to make things work.   How does that saying go about the best laid plans?
>Nancee_Mancel: EGLNS 10J GLENS +29 179
#note First place where I pay for having missed EQUIPS
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGILT 10C GEE. +14 206
#note 5C ELEGIT (which I didn't know) is the sim winner, followed closely by 5D GLEET and 5D LEGIT.  I didn't think it was worth breaking up this rack, given that GEEZ was available and I had line 5 available. 
>Nancee_Mancel: ?DENRSV 2E VENDeRS +71 250
#note Learning point:  Quackle prefers 5E VEND and 2E VERDiNS to this choice, but by statistically insignificant amounts.   While I probably would have played a 2E bingo like Nancee did, I can now see why VEND is so strong:  it kills the rest of bingo lines and she's sitting on the case S and has a blank in her rack.  If she takes out the H5 RAY front hook, I can't bingo anywhere unless I managed to hook HOT with the P, which isn't easy to do.
>Jim_Burlant: EEILLTT C10 .ELT +10 216
#note I felt that opening was the first priority here; I looked at H1 plays and felt that they made the board too easy to defend, as I wanted to keep 5H open.  The sim punishes me for this choice, preferring H1 IDLE, H1 EDIT, K10 LITTLE and E10 ELITE.  I felt that ELITE and LITTLE broke up too much of the rack needlessly, though the tile pool suggests why Quackle wants me to ditch the I.  Regardless, I don't think the H1 plays are the right call here.
>Nancee_Mancel: DEY 11E DYE +38 288
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIILT D12 AI +10 226
#note Maybe if I'd found PREBOILS or EQUIPS, I'd have been able to get this down.  This is now starting to slip away very quickly.  Quackle says 1G AI is my best play, at not quite 11% winning chances.   I felt that I wanted to open up a line for a place to hook my T or L for a 7 if I had the chance.
>Nancee_Mancel: IO 11J OI +11 299
>Jim_Burlant: CCEIILT 12K TIC +13 239
#note Given her last 2 plays, I'm now fixated on trying to keep the board open no matter what instead of looking for my best play.  Best play is L10 ELICIT 21, which sims at 10% winning chances. 
>Nancee_Mancel: FOU 13I FOU +14 313
>Jim_Burlant: AACEILU -ACILU +0 239
#note Panic move.  ACULEI on row 14 is much better than this.  Even the best play of 1G AI sims at not even 7% winning chances.  Not sure I have the exact exchange written down correctly, but it doesn't make a differnence vis-a-vis my next rack.
>Nancee_Mancel: AORR 1F ROAR +26 339
>Jim_Burlant: AACEMNT 14I AM +25 264
#note Perhaps a panic move, but with a blank unseen I didn't think the game was over.  But I didn't like my odds of hitting a bingo on row 14.   D, F, and P were still unseen and I thought her most likely play was to screw up row 5 on her next turn.  So I felt I should open up row 15 to try to make something happen.
>Nancee_Mancel: ?DEINNW 15C tWINNED +99 438
#note I sure made something happen, didn't I?
>Jim_Burlant: AACEINT -  +0 264
#note Lost challenge
>Nancee_Mancel: ABILLOP 5E BLIP +25 463
#note Nancee's comment when she saw me sitting on this rack:  "That's probably the best rack you've had this whole game."  Outside of the orphaned CILIATE and the BIPOLES* rack that I whiffed on, she wasn't far off.    At least certainly after my BOPS play.  If I find EQUIPS or PREBOILS and my racks still collapse this badly, then I can blame tiles.  But you have to look at how poorly I played the early game as to why I lost.  I lost interest in annotating after I lost my desperation challenge of TWINNED, and was unable to reconstruct the final sequence.  Final score 296 - 487.  Ouch.
#note At this point I lost the impetus to continue annotating and don't recall the correct sequence.  The one thing that does stand out:  When Nancee checked her tracking and saw that I was sitting on this rack, her exact words were, "That's probably the best rack you've had this whole game."  At least for the last half of the game, that's true...but I really have to look at (a) my letting her get away with HEINY*, and (b)  the QUAG/BOPS sequence.  If I find EQUIPS and the game still collapses, then I can blame tiles. But there were too many mistakes on my end.  Final score recorded as 296 - 487.
