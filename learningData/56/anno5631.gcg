#note Quackle prefers unloading the X with XI, wihich is the clear winner.  This choice - along with 9H MIX, I6 KIBE, and G7 ICK sim virturally neck and neck.   I preferred unloading the K.

>Jim_Burlant: EEINOUX 9G .NEE +16 34
#note After puzzling over this rack for a couple of minutes, this is all I could come up with.  It's not one of Quackle's original choices but it actually sims respectably, sacrificing only 2.1 pts to 9I OE, the sim winner.  But I think that's misleading because Quackle cannot infer anything about what I'm doing; it's obvious to any remotely competent human opponent that this is a setup of some sort.  Kids, do NOT try this at home!

#note Paula told me after the game she knew I was up to something when I played KNEE, but she had nothing she could do to block the spot - as was the case with 90% of my games this tournament, I blatantly lucked out.  Despite my 30-point lead I'm just under 50% winning chances with this play, which is clearly best.

#note Whew.  Now THAT was a break.  Thiis play sims best by a statistically insignifcant margin.  I chose this because, at the time, I figured that the extra points couldn't hurt.  In retrospect, it would have been smarter to recognize that, since she tried the phony on the previous turn, she didn't have much of anything. So despite the sim results, you could easily make a good case for an exchange here, and that's probably what I should have done.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ADENWZ B2 AZ.N +28 168
#note The duck's top 4 choices all sim within 2 points of each other, and this is one of them.  Other options include C3 WUD, 11K NAW, K10 UNWED.  But there was an unexpected benefit from this play.
>Paula_Catanese: BY A1 BY +26 149
#note As we walked to the challenge machine, she got a chuckle when I told her that if AZONE* was good, I was quitting Scrabble.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEISTW 2A ..W +9 177
#note Picked the wrong time to forget that MICK took a back S.

>Paula_Catanese: EU --  -21 149
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIIST B8 InDITES +74 251
#note That was the unexpected benefit of my AZON play.  Another huge break, which cuts me some slack for the lame fish on the previous turn.  
>Paula_Catanese: ACNOU 12B .OUCAN +16 165
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGNRT 13F DARTiNG +66 317
#note Luckbox!  Quackle prefers GARDaNT in the same location. Incorrectly scored as 65.

#note All I saw were homeless SATINE 8's SHEITANS/STHENIAS and I whiffed on the common word in here.  I suck.

#note Wow, 2 good plays in a row - whose brain have I suddenly borrowed?
>Paula_Catanese: ADEPR K6 PARD.E +28 316
>Jim_Burlant: EEIRSTV L1 VERITES +84 485
#note I was 90% sure PARDUE* was bogus, but that didn't matter; even if I was 100% sure it was bad, I'd have let it stick, as it allowed me to get this down.  And, there was yet another unexpected benefit...
>Paula_Catanese: EIMNPRT -  +0 316
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: EFMT 11A F.T +12 497
#note As was the case with practically this entire tournament, my end games were way out of whack.  FEM O1 is much much better.  How I missed that is beyond me.
>Paula_Catanese: AEGINPR C6 GAPE +16 332
>Jim_Burlant: EM K3 EM +10 507
#note Missing the much better ME D7 for 6 more points.   Oy!
