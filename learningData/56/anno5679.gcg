#note hugely worse than putting the same word at j10. as soon as i hit the clock, i thought - "that was dumb"

#note PAY in the same spot is 3 more points, but this sims top still. why?  i dont know - probably because it doesnt allow an easy 3 letter word from n12.

#note im not normally one for phoneys.......   f9 BOO is the proper play.   Sal had this on hold for about 3 minutes and had his hand on the clock twice but couldnt bring himself to hit it.

#note rightfully punished
>salp: EFIINRT 2M FI. +30 335
#note hmmm. H1 FINITE, 2L FRIZ, 2k FRITZ and my play are all simming close.  Question- does FIZ give me enough of a bingo line leaving TRINE?  Does FRIZ or FRITZ give me any better of a bingo line whilst sacrificing leave?  What are the merits of FINITE? - get to the end of the game sooner, what else?
