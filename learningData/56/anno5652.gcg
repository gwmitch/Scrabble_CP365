>Chris: EFHMRTT 8H THERM +26 26
#note Quackle says 8H THEFT is better by a couple

>Chris: AAADIXY M1 AID +31 166
>Noah: ENT O3 NET +16 131
>Chris: ?AAAUXY 11M XU +20 186
#note Quackle says this is just slightly better than H8 TAXA and 11L AX, which seems suicidal to me.
>Noah: ?EIMNOR H8 .hERMION +86 217
>Chris: ?AAAEPY 6I PA.Y +27 213
>Noah: EGGO 11G G.EGO +14 231
>Chris: ?AACEOS G10 A.O +10 223
#note Figured I was missing a bingo here, but I didn't mind waiting for a better one anyway.  Turns out there were none to be had.  G11 GOA is better by a little.
>Noah: DEW F8 DEW +29 260
>Chris: ?ACEJOS 15D JOyA.CES +74 297
#note Didn't see JACONETS in the same spot, which is more defensive.
>Noah: AEIRV 8A VARIE. +33 293
>Chris: INNOOWZ 14J WON +29 326
#note Or WINO
>Noah: CI F13 IC. +10 303
>Chris: ILNOQTZ B6 ZO. +32 358
>Noah: AGILNPS D6 PA.LINGS +72 375
>Noah: AGILNPS --  -72 303
#note It took all the guts I had to challenge this.  The previous play blocked some bingos through the R.
>Chris: DHILNQT N10 H.ND +29 387
>Chris: DHILNQT --  -29 358
#note This is what killed me.  The possiblity that this might not be good actually went through my head, but my thoughts were something "I haven't been playing scared all weekend; why should I start now?"  Quackle say HUNT wins 95% of the time.
>Noah: AGILNPS N10 P.LING +40 343
#note Ouch.
>Chris: DHILNQT D7 Q. +11 369
#note Now I'm definitely playing scared.  13M QI is better, but E4 HILTED is best with a 73% winning percentage
>Noah: FI E6 FI. +17 360
>Chris: DHILNRT E10 TIRL +17 386
#note Championship player says E11 NTH and 13K NIHIL win 5% and 10% more games respectively than this.  Also, TIRL empties the bag.
>Noah: ABBEOST 13L OB.S +14 374
#note Nice endgame by Noah, though the best sequence involves a quadrant of the board that hasn't seen any action in a while.  See if you can find it.
>Chris: DHINRUV 12K HI +21 407
#note Nothing I can do.  I guess my consolation is that if Noah had just played PULING to begin with, things would have turned out the same.
>Noah: ABET C3 BETA +23 397
#note Well played, Noah!
>Noah:  (DNRUV) +18 415
