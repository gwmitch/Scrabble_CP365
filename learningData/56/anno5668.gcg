#note after a long sim on 4 plies - O3 DIPNET (which also scores 40) is 8% better in win (48 vs 40) than my play, which is the 2nd play. i didnt see DIPNET, but i guess the C vs D leave is key with DD unseen.

#note nice find bob.  SaNDBUR is the other bingo
>james: ?DFNUUY E3 YoU +36 375
#note i obviously saw (GO)Y leaving DFNUU? which means i have to hope for the E for UNFUsED.  My idea was to try and catch Bob with scoring, keeping the other U for a big QU play e.g. quaff, quean, quango etc.   it didnt work out - maybe i was outthinking myself?
