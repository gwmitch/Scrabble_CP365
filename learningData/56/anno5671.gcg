#note I spent a long time on this rack, both trying to find something better and debating my temptation to just play 3I W(E)DEL, which is not far below in the sim.

#note The exchange doesn't sim well at all. I saw 4L AURA for 16, which sims highest, but I wasn't confident that I would draw well enough to IST to make 16 points worth it.

>Jesse: AIIRSTX 12J SIX +40 209
#note I disagree with the duck's suggestion of 11C IXIAS for 38; it gives back easy points considering that there are 6 Is and 4 Us left in the bag. This is not only the highest scoring X play, but the highest scoring X play that doesn't offer back any easy points. 4L TAXI for 30 is the next best option that leaves no easy comeback points, but I'll take my 40.

#note Quackle didn't really like this move but I figured with the case S and down big I needed a lot of help.
>Jesse: EGIMOOY A11 .OOMY +33 321
#note A8 MOO(R)Y for 42 and MOIE(T)Y for 34 both sim higher, but they also needlessly provide him lanes.
