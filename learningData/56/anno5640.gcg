#note Missed the bingo, J1 PREHUMAN.  However, 6B PEH or PEH are quackle's top choices.

#note Hard to do much with the the counters here.  Quackle's top choice is 5H GIFT

#note J8 NEXT is a top choice, but I was getting sick of that Q

#note Looked like he was setting something up, so I thought it was worth spending the S.  
>Michael_Thelen: ETV J6 VE.T +15 185
>Laurie: ADITUUX 5K .AUD +11 248
#note YUCK. What to do?  Quackle's top pick is K9 AUDIT.  I decided to be a little more defensive

>Michael_Thelen: CLO E1 COL +17 219
>Laurie: AEGIRTU A4 GUA.. +8 275
#note Quackle's top play is K9 AUGITE, but the Michael's plays suggest he's close to a bingo and that play seems very risky
>Michael_Thelen: EF N2 F.E. +28 247
>Laurie: CEIIORT 1H OR +14 289
#note Hard to decide here as I really wanted to get rid of one of the I's.  Quackle's top picks all open the board:  K9 OTIC, 9J TI, K9 ICIER.  I decided to keep playing defense.  With this board, 14 pts isn't a bad score, although I'm at risk for a really ugly rack next time
>Michael_Thelen: AERV L2 V... +7 254
>Laurie: CEIIIPT 7J .PIC +11 300
#note Quackle's top moves were 9J TIPI or exchanging
>Michael_Thelen: AEGNORT 6A .N. +13 267
>Laurie: AEIINOT -EIO +0 300
#note Things aren't improving much here and I figured I might as well fish for one of the two R's to play QINTAR. I should have exchanged both Is, but I must have forgotten that the I was already there.
