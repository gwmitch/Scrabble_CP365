#note this comes down very quickly with a sim after the annoyingly obvious GOITRE/GOITER . why can't i be that clever. -11

#note WOT at 4C sims a little better. i didn't want it to turn into a staircase or to give up those points. -1

#note i knew that c13 HAP would sim highest. maybe 14M WHA. i should have just not been a chicken and freakin played HAP. the problem i saw is that after HAP, he would then empty the bag, i'd do ZAP or VIZIR and he may be able to go out (or outrun me, i don't know). keeping the V sucks though. i don't know! -9.5%

#note 13C VENULAR sets up SEPAL. maybe he would have missed it. i don't know. doh. i was hyper low on time here, i really should play faster. axon was so annoying.. -27
