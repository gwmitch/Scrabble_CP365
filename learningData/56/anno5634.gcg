#note Not thrilled with leaving duplicated O's, but 24 pts to unload the Q was too much to pass up.  Clearly best.
>Peter_Noom: EEZ 7H ZEE +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ?DDFNOO 6J FOOD +29 53
#note Best.
>Peter_Noom: DFGHOSU -DFGHOS +0 27
#note A random quackle-generated rack; I have no idea what his rack was.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGINS 9F lIGANDS +89 142
#note Other choices include SIGANiD and SiGANID in the same location, but this sims best.
>Peter_Noom: AKNW L9 .WANK +24 51
>Jim_Burlant: AEENOSU 14F AENEOUS +74 216
#note Lucky - in more ways than one.
>Peter_Noom: ELUX -  +0 51
#note Peter told me after the game that as we were walking to the adjudication machine on this turn, he realized he had made a big mistake challenging this play.  He knew AENEOUS was good and was challenging the SWANK back-hook.  His challenge was ill-advised because, even if he wasn't sure about SWANKS, he still had LUXE 15G 52 as a comeback, which meant that he would have been trailing by "only" 216 - 103.  And given my next rack, he probably wasn't going to win this game regardless.  But the unsuccessful challenge threw gasoline on the fire.
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEJLOR 15A CaJOLER +102 318
#note Interestingly, while this play had the highest valuation by over 20 points, this play sims identically on a win-percentage basis to JOlTER 15D, obviously because the S hook doesn't become a threat.  I just saw the bingo and slapped it down, not seeing the non-bingo alternative. Of course I was concerned about the S hook at H15, but  I figured that a 318-51 lead with both blanks already having been played, I could take a chance.
>Peter_Noom: ELSUX -  +0 51
#note When it rains, it pours.  Another lost challenge.  Peter was pretty much challenging this out of a, "Well, what do I have to lose, this game is already over" sort of amused mood.
>Jim_Burlant: AADLRTT G11 ALT.. +6 324
#note On the surface this is a weak play.  Not even among quackle's original choices, it winds up winning the 2-ply sim.  My main aim was to make it harder for him to hit H15 with an S.  So let's see - through six turns, ZERO equity loss.  Don't worry - I'm sure I'll screw it up.
>Peter_Noom: CEILSUX N2 LUXES +39 90
>Jim_Burlant: ADEMMRT O1 DAM +24 348
#note Here I committed the cardinal sin of going for defense on one turn, then changing my mind.  What I should have done this turn was play MM 13I to kill any chance at 15H plays.  I'm guessing that I let the fact that I'd been drawing so absurdly well this whole tournament cloud my judgment, and I was now having second thoughts about being so defensive.  I didn't want to be in the situation where I closed the line down, then drew the S.  Nonetheless, this choice is inexplicable - how I didn't look harder for the X-overlap down the M column is beyond me.  The X overlap didn't register until the next turn, by which time it was too late.  This is a very poor play and I get deservedly slammed for it in the sim.  MADDER M3 42 wins the sim, with MM13I coming in a strong second.  
>Peter_Noom: ENORV M3 VEN.OR +49 139
#note Excellent play, but I do have a philosophical question -  I wonder if it's better for him to hold onto the OR, play VEND for 43, and extend the game by playing short?  Or is this game a lost cause at this point and is it better for him to max his points out?
>Jim_Burlant: BEEMNRT 12B TREMB.E +24 372
#note Best - none of the other choices come within 5 points.  This is the only play that sims at 100% winning chances.
>Peter_Noom: BDO L2 BOD +43 182
#note He certainly got his money's worth out of that corner, didn't he?
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOWY K11 YO +22 394
#note Highest valuation play here is 13G TOWY, which I didn't see, but it does not win the sim.  M11 YEA is the sim winner here.  Leave be damned I probably should have shut down H15 with YEW for 13.
>Peter_Noom: AIPRRTY -AIPR +0 182
#note A random quackle-generated rack; I have no idea what his rack was.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRVW C7 WAVIE. +20 414
#note At this point I wasn't concerned about equity or building another bingo rack; I was just trying to empty the bag as quickly as possible.  I should have taken a closer look at the pool and assumed that he was drawing 4 to S and 2 other tiles in hopes of hitting 15H, which I should have killed with the cheap defensive play of REV.  Fortunately my lead here is so great he can't win the game but this was still a slipup that I should have avoided.  Best equity play here is VAW 11A, and I didn't think of the A front hook to TREMBLE.  
>Peter_Noom: IRS H11 R.I.S +67 249
#note Incorrectly scored as 63.
>Jim_Burlant: CGHINRT 8A CH.RT +33 447
#note  Quackle prefers 8A TRAGI, which makes sense given the tile pool and its abundance of I's.
>Peter_Noom: FI 8M .IF +18 267
>Jim_Burlant: AEGHINN D3 HANGE. +25 472
#note Huge valuation hit here but again I'm just trying to end this game ASAP by emptying the bag as quickly as possible.
