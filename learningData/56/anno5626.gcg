#note after this i'm putting him a) on the other blank, b) on an absolutely horrible rack that enforced him to burn the blank for 46.

#note it's possible he has the other blank, but really even so, what else can i do but this play?

#note joel was collecting my money as i was making this decision. i had the feeling he'd see something better than my play - Q likes 11A PEE or NET or D13 PE - but i like to keep lanes open -  for 8s. still not sure about this one.

#note not on Q's list, but sims top. My rationale for the EIT leave was that Jeremy had been suffering with vowel issues and the pool was consonant heavy. I wanted to rid the R as there was RRRR unseen and I hate RR on my rack. I also wanted to score to E3 so Jeremy couldnt.

#note a no brainer really - makes it hard for him to bingo. but Q likes k9 FUND(I) and a bunch of stuff like FU(N)D or FU(N)DI a bit better - not sure why.
