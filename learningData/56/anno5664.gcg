#note Quackle prefers exchanging UU, which I considered...but rejected.  I'd be more inclined to exchange UU if it left me LINES or DINES...but I felt that, especially if she made a small defensive play it would be all too probable that I'd have a homeless bingo...then what?  I'd rather take 5 cracks at the unseen SSSS??XJZ, score 17 points, and not have to worry about 2 U's coming back from the dead at a more critical point in the game. This choice sims within one point of the top choice, exchange U.  The difference in the sim between any of the first 6 choices is barely 1 point, which suggests the best play here is more about stylistic preference than a clear-cut case of right/wrong.

#note Too bad I couldn't think of FLEDGE or even FREED, both of which are better than this choice.  Though GEEZ scores well, it is a poor play for 2 reasons.  First, it doesn't turn enough of this consonant-overloaded rack, and the DFLR leave could be problematic unless I draw at least 2 vowels.   Secondly - trailing by this margin I need to keep the board alive for bingos as I can; this doesn't just kill row 15; it also kills row 14 and makes the board easier for her to defend.  Wasn't happy about this play when I made it, but the neurons weren't firing properly and I didn't see anything better.

#note This is another rack that needed to be turned.  After a couple of minutes this was all I could come up with - pathetic.  5F FURLED is the winner here; don't know how I missed this.  Still brian-locked, I guess.  The silver lining: the draw bails me out of this mistake on the next turn.

#note So much for being back in the game.  Sigh.

#note A7 FEOD wins the sim.  Given my situation, there is some merit to playing short and therefore lengthening the game.  But, having said that, I don't think I'm going to get very far keeping LNY.  I'd rather unload the Y and try to draw into a rack that's worth building.  Additionally, since I didn't have a good play on row 1, this keeps row 1 alive as there are now 2 triple lines open.  This choice sims second, losing roughly 3 points to the sim winner.

#note Best - the duck says I have barely 13% winning chances now.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ATV 4A VA.T +22 282
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIT M3 I.EATE +16 234
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  AVIATE A3 is the clear winner - too bad I didn't look harder to find it.  While I bungled the early game, my last 3 turns have been solid.  However, this choice  is one I really have to look at insofar as where I contributed to my own downfall, and you'll see why in a moment.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEEINS A8 AE +17 251
#note Quackle prefers A4 VEENA.   I don't agree.  Given the pool - only 1 E left plus 3 T's still unseen - there was a very good chance of drawing into a SATINE bingo.  What do I do if I burn both E's on this turn?
>Ruth_Hamilton: AOPSY O8 SOAPY +54 363
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINST 13H ENTASIA +71 322
#note I have to wonder - while I still would have been vowel-addled if I played AVIATE instead of IDEATE a couple of turns back, would she have had as potent of a sequence as BONG/SOAPY?   
>Ruth_Hamilton: TUX 12K TUX +35 398
#note I had played ENTASIA (as opposed to TAENIAS L8) with the hopes of opening a number of lines for potential 8's; with the blank unseen there was the slim possibility of a miracle bingo.  But this was an excellent play by her, as it killed all byt one of the remaining lines.  And when I saw my next rack I knew the game was over and that the end game was going to be mere formality.

#note Couldn't decide what to do here and essentially just put something down to score points.

#note At this point I stopped annotating and cannot reconstruct the sequence; we played out the end game with nothing noteworthy occurring.  Final score was recorded as 377 - 449.  While there were a number of tough racks, I really have to look at how poorly I played on turns 2, 3, and 7 before blaming tiles for this loss.
