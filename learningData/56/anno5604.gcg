>Ryan_Fischer: EHJORRV 8D HOVER +30 30
#note I can never beat Paul Avrin.  I missed DALETHS/TAS for 91 in Dayton versus him.  He always seems to get away with phonies I know are no good.  Fitting I get a curve ball rack like this to start.
>Paul_Avrin: LLMOY 7G MOLLY +23 23
>Ryan_Fischer: EGJQRTV -GJQV +0 30
#note JET 6F.  Was looking at 7C, saw it wasn't enough.  That leave is pretty ugly, though.
>Paul_Avrin: AEINNSS C2 INSANES +78 101
#note SIENNAS, dammit!  D'oh!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHRRTW E5 THR.WER +52 82
>Paul_Avrin: CEERT 8K ERECT +29 130
>Ryan_Fischer: AACDINU 6J ADUNC +27 109
#note Besides letting INSANES* go, this is a pretty bad play.  He took my preferred placement, and my new one kills three lanes with little hope for resuscitation.  Better I think is ADUNC at D11, though Quack says D1 UNAI 18.
>Paul_Avrin: DKPU 10B PUK.D +22 152
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIIIMS 9G MAGI +25 134
#note Quack says just WIG there.  Shrug.
>Paul_Avrin: U -U +0 152
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIILST 10J FIL +27 161
>Paul_Avrin: ?AEGINW O8 .WEAkING +83 235
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFISST 12A FATES +38 199
#note Just a horrible move, compounded by my missing FISSATE FIESTAS.  Ugh.
>Paul_Avrin: BZ 2B B.Z +28 263
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEILOS A12 .LOE +21 220
#note I blocked my own OILSEED, but at least I played this rack sort of right.  OE E1 is Quackle's suggestion, which is actually pretty good.
>Paul_Avrin: OO D2 .OO +30 293
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIISUX L10 .UX +20 240
#note Can't believe I overlooked XI, but I thought I kinda had to.
>Paul_Avrin: DEINTT 13H TINTED +27 320
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIIJSY -IIJY +0 240
#note I try, for once, to stop clinging on to so many vowels, missing a bunch of viable plays in the process.
>Paul_Avrin: AOP H12 A.OP +21 341
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEEIOS 2B ...E +15 255
>Paul_Avrin: AENY 1E YEAN +26 367
#note He said my move changed his, so I guess he was set to play (C)AY or YA.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEIIOS 2H OxIDISE +70 325
#note Best.  I finally did something right.  Note the rare blank declarations of K and X in this game!  :)
>Paul_Avrin: IQ 1L QI +44 411
>Ryan_Fischer: ABGRTUV O1 GRUB +38 363
>Paul_Avrin: AIJOR 3F AIR +7 418
#note Champ picks JIAO for him to save the most points.  E3.  Somehow we had a T on his rack in post mortem that he must have gotten mine confused for his, 'cause I pointed out ROTI 3C, can't figure out why with what he has left for blocking both of my outs.
>Ryan_Fischer: ATV J1 V.TA +7 370
>Ryan_Fischer:  (JO) +18 388
#note I save a lot of spread there playing the endgame pretty well, but it was probably the worst-played game of my tournament.  Yuck.
