#note I really should have exchanged here, though the sim gives a slight preference to 7F GIVE.  Making this play, I was very concerned that he could burn me if he had the X.  Should I really be that worried about an X on the first turn of the game?
>Jim_Wait: INPTUZ D1 PUTZIN. +44 62
#note Well, at least he didn't have the X.
>Jim_Burlant: EHIIIIT -III +0 12
#note The exchanges all sim within 1/2 point of each other.  Quackle also prefers tossing the H.  
>Jim_Wait: ANTV 2B VA.NT +20 82
>Jim_Burlant: EHISSTT 10D THEISTS +74 86
#note Preferred this placement for 2 reasons.  First, I didn't like slotting the 3x3 for only 7 more points; my personal comfort zone is somewhere between 10 and 15.  Secondly, I didn't want to give the easy A front-hook down the A column.  The J1 placement sims best; I'm guessing that the sim says that it's worth the extra risk of slotting the 3x3 (a) for the extra points and (b) to make sure I take out the GRIEVE backhooks.

#note Best.
>Jim_Wait: AINO 1D .IANO +25 140
>Jim_Burlant: ?IIKNSX C11 .IX +26 143
#note Best; despite the easy comebacks it offers, nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Jim_Wait: Q F6 Q. +31 171
>Jim_Burlant: ?GIKLNS 12F SuLKING +78 221
#note The three 12F choices (SILKiNG, SiLKING, SuLKING) tie for second place in the sim.  J1 LIKiNGS wins by not even 0.2% winning chances, though it concedes 0.7 points of valuation.  Guess that Quackle feels I need to place a priority on taking out the back-hooks to GRIEVE.
>Jim_Wait: AGPR B12 PARG +27 198
>Jim_Burlant: ADDELSU H12 .AUD +15 236
#note Whoops!  Thought PARG* looked funny but wasn't sure enough to challenge.    Nothing really stands out in the sim; J2 LAUDED 24 wins but I didn't think this rack needed to be broken up.  Maybe flimsy logic, but (a) I don't even lose 3 points with this choice, and (b) I get rewarded for it big-time on my next turn.
>Jim_Wait: AEL A13 LEA +30 228
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILSY 15H .IALYSED +101 337
#note Best, now over 95% winning chances.
>Jim_Wait: CDLO J4 COLD +21 249
>Jim_Burlant: EEEHOOR 4B OO.E +13 350
#note With a lead this big and the bag under 20, I'd much rather ensure that I can keep draining the bag on every turn, rather than score 29, leave myself a ghastly rack, and have to exchange, thus prolonging the game for him.   Given my leave, scoring at least 25 points will not be a problem next turn if he does hit a bingo.  In short, I'm less worried about equity than about making sure I can continue to turn tiles. Quackle's first 3 choices are 14L OOH 29, 14M OHO 27 (both of which I rejected due to leave), and 4G REE(C)HO 24.  Of those choices, I like REECHO  best, but I didn't know it.
>Jim_Wait: AJR 2H RAJ +28 277
>Jim_Burlant: BEEEHRU 14J HE +28 378
#note I saw 14J HEBE but didn't want to give him the possibility of a bingo ending in sE (e.g.:  FRUCTOsE) backhooking it at N14.  Thus, I elected to trade points for safety.  If the blank wasn't unseen I wouldn't have thought twice about playing HEBE.  Out of quackle's suggestions, the one I like best (which I didn't know) was EUCHRE 4H 24.  Scores reasonably well and does a terrific job clearing the rack and hastening the end of the game.
>Jim_Wait: MR 5C R.M +20 297
>Jim_Burlant: BEEIRU 14N BI +19 397
#note I didn't write this rack down correctly; I only know I played BI.
>Jim_Wait: ANRY 5G RAY.N +16 313
>Jim_Burlant: EEEEMRU 9H .EE +12 409
#note As good as anything else, and I wanted to make sure I didn't empty the bag.   Quackle's preference (by statistically insignificant amount) is 4J CUE;  given that I have 4 e's in my rack, I prefer to get rid of two of them.

>Jim_Burlant: CEOR 14F EC. +7 443
#note Amateur hour.  Jim was running very low on time and I wanted to keep his clock running so i didn't think the position through carefully enough.  COR 13M scores much better and would have more than made up any point differential that I would have gotten had I succeeded in putting Jim over on time (he finished wth 1 second left on his clock).  And 4J COERCE would have been an out.
