#note Thrilled to have such a great starting rack, I carelessly failed to think about the extensions - could have been costly.

#note A phoney! INSHEATH and ENSHEATH are good either way, but UNSHEATHE needs the E. Lucky for me, Carl wasn't sure either.
>Carl: DEGLQRW 13F GL.W +22 160
#note Carl:"I thought it would be close between this and WERGELD. QI is best in either spot, probably because I'm close to some version of WEREGILD or GLOWERED as a bingo."

>Carl: DEELLQR A7 Q.ELL +14 174
#note "Again, a variety of draws to DEELLR make QI 4D the best play by a large margin."

#note Looks right to play only 1 tile - there's no way to block everything. Actually, ZAX may turn out best, often resulting in FAENA 1D for a big score.
