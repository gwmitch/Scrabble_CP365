>Andrea_Michaels: DEOOW 8D WOOED +26 26
>Chris_Tallman: AEEIKSV D8 .AIVE +22 22
#note (O)AK is the fishier option, but this seems fine too 

>Andrea_Michaels: BFO 7G FOB +27 53
>Chris_Tallman: ?EIKNOS 13D SONlIKE +77 99
#note DOESKIN A13 is pretty hard to find with a blank D i guess... INVOKERS is also playable for 1 more poit. At least this forks with 2 big spots - without the J14 spot I'd have kept looking.
>Andrea_Michaels: Q H12 Q. +21 74
>Chris_Tallman: AIMNTXY 14I IXNAY +62 161
#note I was only 75% sure IXNAY didn't take an S! Given that, maybe I should play it safe and just play AX or XI.. there's also another sick play in this position that doesn't use the J14 spot at all...
>Andrea_Michaels: AEHM 15L HAEM +53 127
#note T(A)XIMAN C9! It wouldn't have given this up either :P  (I still think IXNAY is probably best)
>Chris_Tallman: EILMSTW 15F WILT +28 189
#note Debated between the aggressive MEW G9 and WILT, but decided eventually the this spot was too dangerous to leave. A super aggro option Q  suggests is WI(KI) I11, making the spot S-only and keeping MELTS! WILT is still a fine play but I'm disappointed I didn't see that!
>Andrea_Michaels: AAIR 13L ARIA +26 153

>Andrea_Michaels: PZ 9C Z.P +28 208
>Chris_Tallman: ?EILNRS J1 LIeRNES +69 298
#note 10H SILvERN is clearly the best bingo here; the only one that doesn't throw open the board. I need to take more time on bingo turns in general. 
>Andrea_Michaels: DENRSTU 1E TRUND.ES +80 288
#note Deserved punishment
>Chris_Tallman: EOOPTTU 5H TE.UTO +12 310
#note Following one bad play with another - missed UPROOT, which seems clearly best. TOUTON R5 is a better version of my play too. 
>Andrea_Michaels: GHI L1 .IGH. +18 306
>Chris_Tallman: AINOPUV J9 AVO +21 331
#note I saw ANOPIA on this turn, but UV leave in a close game.. no.
>Andrea_Michaels: EF K11 FE +20 326
>Chris_Tallman: AINOPSU O8 ANOPI. +27 358
#note Should I be Quackle and exchange U here? If Andrea has the Y and hits N10 I might be in trouble with a bad draw, but exchanging 1 in a 5 point game with 12 in the bag, really?
>Andrea_Michaels: BDU N8 DUB +27 353
>Chris_Tallman: ADEOSTU M8 ODA +21 379
#note Given the pool, Q likes like OD over ODA.. but felt the need to score as much as possible...
>Andrea_Michaels: AR 10B RA. +16 369
>Chris_Tallman: CESTTUY N1 CUTESY +45 424
#note Yay!
>Andrea_Michaels: CEGLRR E6 CL.. +8 377
#note -4
>Chris_Tallman: T 11J ..T +6 430
#note The lesson of this game - nice draws don't give a player the right to turns his/her brain off!
>Chris_Tallman:  (EGRR) +10 440
