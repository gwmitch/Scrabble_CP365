#note I really liked this play. Controlled the board really well. But it may have been an oversight. Lots of things can happen after this play that are bad for me. OV sucks, too, and doesn't actually defend well on this board. Perhaps I should play 11I EGO. 11K OGIVE is too crazy for me, but it's probably correct.
>Raghuram_Jonnalagedda: OP 11J PO. +28 70
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAMOOV M6 AVO +13 59
#note this is crazy. I should have played OGIVE last turn, which is not as crazy as this. I should have played 7E OVA or AVO if I wanted to be safer.

>Joshua_Sokol: ??ABIMO N8 AMBOnIc +84 143
#note I was convinced this was good, as AMBO/AMBONES/AMBONATE were good, and UMBO/UMBONES/UMBONATE were good. Tsk, logic. I was lucky he didn't challenge, and BIMOdAl was better anyway as I realized during the hold.

#note Bad bad overlook of IFFY here. Really dodged a bullet.

#note Not sure if this was my rack. We both missed SECULAR. I saw RECUSAL. I wanted to block CLUE, naturally.
