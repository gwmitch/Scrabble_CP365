I'm surprised POACH is outside top ten, though maybe is  because I'm hoping Tim doesn't know the Y-back hook

#note RUTH J4 #1   
Mine was just outside top ten.   LNOS looks like solid enough leave, but is it -so- much better than LUT as to sacrifice 12 points?

SHOTGUN for 38 was most fun

#note PLEX 2F was best, though not by lots.   I considered it, didn't care for keeping the duplicate N's -and- a U.   '

10 points was a lot to give up, but I'm counting on scoring the X solidly later.

It's late enough that I see not spending the case U with the Q unseen as important, of course
>Tim_Fish: EI M1 .IE +8 250
>Matthew_Ridout: ADIMRUZ N3 MIRZA +40 318
#note I'm especially curious for opinions on this  move.  Was my play too aggressive?  He's just fished off EI for seeimingly-likely good bingo leave.

I ran a 5000 iteration, 5-ply sim on this one and MIRZA did in fact show up best at 87% to win, despite giving up the most avg points on opp reply and, unsurprisingly, the highest chance of a return bingo.   

I never saw IZARD G11 which game up second at 85% to win.  At a sacrifice of just 2 points, I would've played it.  Tim can bingo from N3 as easily as column O, but for more points from O.

I considered CUZ from CI, but the case U looks to important.
