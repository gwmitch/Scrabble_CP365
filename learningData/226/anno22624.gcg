#note aaaaaaaaaah. Didn't think UNACTED was good!!! My worst blunder of the tournament. I also almost passed, which sims really well, because, well, I have a bingo on my rack. We wondered what would have happened if I had passed, Doug had exchanged, and I had played UNACTED the next turn.

#note Perhaps I am confused in this position. I am probably wrong for thinking I can control this board. Doug just blew it way open, and Doug knows what he's doing. In that sense, I should probably just take the 3 points for HEBES. This also gives back more immediate big scoring plays. I think that that's a bad thing here. I don't want Doug to get back within range.

#note This was slightly stupid, but slightly brilliant. I got ultra greedy here, and I thought that this Q-stuck Doug if he had the Q. That's the slightly stupid part: I3 QI is obvious in hindsight. But this is definitely a good play for spread purposes. K4 Q(I) might be a better play for Doug than I3 QI, since he is setting up one of his I's for next turn. NI(X) and TI(X) score 42+11 (53), whereas a sequence such as I3 QI + H4 VIN scores 24+25 (49). But he has to get rid of his V, so this doesn't really do much, actually. The only thing it does very well is set me up for 56 points next turn with ZERO, and if I end up drawing the Q, I am not stuck with it. And this leaves one in the bag. Anyways, this was probably the only interesting position in this game for me, but it boils down to "do you want to torture your opponent for another couple of agonizing turns, or would you rather strike now and shorten his agony?"
