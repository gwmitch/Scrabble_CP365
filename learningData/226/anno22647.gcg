#note I have a fantastic rack for going second, but mike didn't supply me a handy letter to play through. there are lots of reasonable ideas here - ACID at 8F, CADI at 8G, CNIDA and ID at 8H are all close. In retrospect my play of choice is CADI.

#note I did not think that PERVO had been added to TWL, even though I reviewed the new 5s right before the tournament. In fact PERVO is new in CSW15 from TWL15!

#note major error, JOIST sets up my S nicely with only one more unseen. just didn't spot it

>JD: ?FGIOTV 11D VOG +21 261
#note especially given mike's fishy play last turn, I really wanted to block on the right, but couldn't figure out how to do so while still scoring decently. with a blank in hand I think it's OK for me to take the points the 14 extra points for VOG instead of VIG at N7.
>Mike_Frentz: EIILORT O5 ELI.ITOR +61 226
#note the danger of not blocking - this rack doesn't do much if I do sacrifice the points on my previous turn. I still think it's a tough call since I'm holding a blank.
>JD: ??DFGIT J9 F.D. +16 277
#note ooh, didn't come up with GIFTEDLY. pretty sweet. I figured I can leave the L open a turn with both blanks, if he bingos I can bingo down from the B.
