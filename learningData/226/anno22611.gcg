>jd: EEHHMNR 8G HEH +18 18
#note JD: pretty even with REHEM
>cesar: ADGIRSS I5 DIS.RAGS +65 65
#note Zar: I knew I5 simmed higher! it's because G5 gives up higher scoring parallel plays. so this isn't a mistake. stop telling me it is JD  >:(
>jd: EEMNORT 5E ENTO.ERM +94 112
>cesar: ?DEFGLO 11E FLOG.ED +52 117
#note Zar: didn't bother looking for a bingo too long here. this is far better than 10E FOLIAGED.
>jd: ADEEIIZ H1 DIAZ. +75 187
#note JD: as I pulled my tiles out of the bag I was waiting for possibly drawing DIAZO, but then I spent 3-4 minutes deciding between AZIDO and GAZED. gah!
>cesar: ?IOQRTU 4A QUOIT +50 167
#note Zar: again this is better than the only bingo QUITTORS.. although it's closer.
>jd: ?EEGIMR 1A REIMaGE. +92 279
>cesar: ?ADEIRT M3 DIsRATE +79 246
#note Zar: there is seriously nobody luckier than JD. i need to find 12G DISRATEs though. -0.5 JD: DISRATES at 12G forks the board nicely, although the board is still very open anyway.
>jd: AAINNTW A4 .ANAT +42 321
>cesar: BNOPUVX L7 PUB +19 265
#note Zar: puton sims best. i don't know what to do here. i wanted to fish for SIX/DIAZOS.
>jd: AFINRSW 10I .W +26 347
#note JD: a great situation to be in! AFINRS is an unusually good rack for me to fish with, hitting INFARES and INSOFAR on column B. Then if I miss I can most likely fish off my F next turn at J6.
>cesar: NNOOVWX 12I .NOW +23 288
#note Zar: WOVEN J2 is definitely the obvious choice here, but I wanted to give 6H SIX one more try.  -5
>jd: AFINRST 6I .F +26 373
>cesar: INOOVXY 13L OXY +31 319
#note Zar: fine i give up. and he's going to bingo because of his last two moves, i am aware. i guess maybe 2D OXO?
>jd: ABINRST 14F BRISANT +73 446
#note I incorrectly dismissed the new SORBITAN as being CSW-only (previously it was). good thing he gave me a spot
>cesar: EINOORV 15A RENVOI +43 362
#note Zar: VROOOOOOM! F.
>jd: EEIIOUY 3C YOU +27 473
>cesar: AACOSTV 8L ..A +3 365
#note Zar: not going to bother simming this too far especially since quackle prefers B10 VACATE and 12C OVA. no lol.
>jd: AEEIIKL 9L ..AL +8 481
#note JD: had to block at all costs. considered putting the K at N7 but that opens column O bingos! also thought about BEAK at 9L, but he can score too easily. Q also likes AIL at 4L as a block, but this pretty much prevents him from fishing.
>cesar: ACOPSTV 3G V.C +15 380
#note Zar: maybe B12 COVE, but that blocks a lane. is there anything possible in lane O? JD: the only word there appears to be OUTSLICK!
>jd: EEEIIKU O9 .EU +3 484
#note JD: my priority here for spread should be blocking the remaining pesky bingos he can draw on the left side. EEK should do the trick at B8.
>cesar: AELOPST 6M .E +4 384
#note Zar: 4L OI would not open an additional lane, and neither do any of quackle's choices. I think this is ok. I can draw unblockable aposti/topsail 2/9 times.
>jd: CEEIIKL B9 ICELIK. +38 522
#note JD: too bad REK* didn't make this dictionary update
