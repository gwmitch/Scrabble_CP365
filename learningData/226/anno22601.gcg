#note once i start playing badly it's hard to stop. M1 EYEN, 5E RYND or evne I7 NAY are reasonable. DYING is really dumb. -6.5

#note quackle doesn't like bingoing here, and neither do I now that I think about it. 5I OWES looks like the play here. I have time to bingo. -9

#note maybe 8A OHIA, especially after his play. i'm pretty lucky he didn't bingo. i give him an O but block bingos from the R/thru S/E etc. -6

>cesar: AAIILOV A9 VIOLA +16 390
#note this is a hideously bad play. it is so bad that i generated all plays and it sims almost last. this is because i missed the possibility of INVIOLATE to outright lose the game. i didn't play VIA because i thought he could draw vesuvian or some other crazy bingo, without even noticing that it didn't fit. i don't know how i win scrabble games. -A LOT
