#note first of all, LIEF is a word. also, stop playing so paranoid. 13A GULF is probably ok. I had a feeling this would not sim well, but GULF sims far best. maybe i don't need to worry about defense in general. :P  -13

#note just attempting to play some defense. thought of just doing 13G LEFT or FET or something but why do i want to give him a lane, ever. FLOWN is probably fine. -6

#note i was going to do PETTLE but i can't let that stand. inferencing an S makes RETE jump up but PETTLE still sims best because quackle is raw mathematics. -7
