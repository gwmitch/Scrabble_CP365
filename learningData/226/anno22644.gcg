#note I wasn't sure about ABORTER, and more importantly did not think REISSUER was good at all. about 8 points or so worse
>Vijay: AFH 12C FAH +36 134
>JD: ADIITYZ K4 DITZY +54 157
#note intriguing. I settled for a much worse leave by passing up ZAIDY, but did so because ZAIDY sets up huge Z counterplays. but Q suggests that I overestimated this effect - ZAIDY is only about 3 points worse on defense. I suppose the board is already quite open.

>JD: AAIKNUV 3E AUK +23 180
#note I spent a long time looking at this aukward rack. VINA at 14A ends up simming a bit better, simply because it scores a bunch more and AINV doesn't bingo all that much (only 19%).

>Vijay: CDEIM N10 MEDIC +40 273
#note vijay held an O on this turn. nice play
>JD: ABCILMR 4A CLIMB +32 241
#note lots of reasonable plays available. the best simming play is BRIM at O7, but I didn't like blocking a potential high-scoring bingo lane. I also thought about CAMEL at M9 but the leave seemed poor.
>Vijay: INQS A4 .INQS +48 321
>JD: AGORRTU 15J TURGOR +35 276
#note not looking good, I hated to block my best lane, but at least I keep myself in range to catch up with a bingo, and the rest of the board is fairly open.

#note definitely the right move, but I was already over on time at this point!!
>Vijay: ADEH 3L HEAD +27 400
>JD: EEENTTU 2N TE +15 362
#note not much else to try, at least makes vijay have to think a bit to block.
>Vijay: DW L2 W..D +13 413
#note elegant block of both rows 1 and 6.

#note I went over 2 minutes total. nice playing by vijay, I never really threatened him this time.
