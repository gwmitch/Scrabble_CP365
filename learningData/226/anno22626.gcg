>Joshua_Sokol: EEINRTW 5D TWEENI.R +94 102
#note This game should have been me getting decimated for making bingo mistakes. But Ed couldn't pull the challenge trigger on this one.

>Joshua_Sokol: DENOOTZ A1 ZOO.ED +54 224
>Ed_de_Guzman: AIQ 12I QA.I +28 109
#note Ed had been using up a lot of time already, and I was time rushing him.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDNSTTT 13J T.ND +14 238
#note DENT is one more point, but it does give Ed the chance of playing (Q)I/I(DENT), which could be huge, so the point doesn't matter. TENT might be better though. Or just an exchange?
>Ed_de_Guzman: CEEU 7I E.UCE +16 125
#note Ed was very, very low on time here. Like 6 minutes.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCFSTT 8M FAB +29 267
>Ed_de_Guzman: AY B1 AY +31 156
>Joshua_Sokol: CLPSTTW F3 PL.W +17 284
#note In essence, when you time rush somebody, you want to reduce their counterplay as best as you can, even if it costs you. If I play WEPT, which may be around 0.5 points better than PL(E)W because of the more balanced leave, and Ed has a bingo beginning in I that didn't play (very unlikely but possible), my strategy of fastplaying has failed. But maybe WEPT is better even in this scenario, based on the board being pretty open for 7s anyway.
>Ed_de_Guzman: HIK F9 KHI +25 181
#note underscored by 5... Weird.
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNSTT 11A LITAN.ST +66 350
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNSTT --  -66 284
#note He blocked my bingo. Good thing that while he was spending time looking for a play, I wrote down all of the alphagrams with AILNSTT + AEIOU, and saw that I could play LITANIST* through an I!
>Ed_de_Guzman: ?AENOST D3 d..ONATES +59 240
#note here is where things get a bit sour. Keep in mind Ed has around 4 minutes left on his clock.
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNSTT C9 ATILT +19 303
#note Effectively the most apropos play for me at this point.
>Ed_de_Guzman: EGIR H1 REIG. +24 264
>Joshua_Sokol: AEMNSV 2H .AVE +15 318
#note Forgot my full rack, but I was blocking the E and the R here and creating scoring options for myself at K1. It was probably the right play
>Ed_de_Guzman: CHOU 4J .OUCH +28 292
>Joshua_Sokol: AJMNSSY N4 .AJ +29 347
#note This seemed correct, as I am not emptying the bag and scoring so that I can outrun his very unlikely bingos. But I am more at a risk of losing to an X play here at K1. So I should play N1 MAS(H) or perhaps K1 MYNAS or just MY to block those.
>Ed_de_Guzman: OX 14M OX +40 332
>Joshua_Sokol: IMNNSSY 12E ISM +16 363
#note Amazingly, Ed drew into BA(T)GIRLs! I must therefore block. I took my grand old time here, as Ed had begun playing extremely fast and accurately after his bingo. This should never have been a game. G11 SYN leaves me outs that I missed, because instead of looking for other outs, I was too focused on SYNS* being invalid.
>Ed_de_Guzman: ?ABGILR 1K ABoIL +29 361
#note B10 AB is only 1 point better than this, so very good endgame by Ed.
>Joshua_Sokol: NNSY 3F .Y.N +17 380
>Ed_de_Guzman: GR 9A GR.. +5 366
#note Ed having missed GRR, I ended up making the best endgame play. S(A)Y/(VENDUE)S was tied with PYIN, but that's only if Ed sees 11J GRR.
>Ed_de_Guzman:  (NS) +4 370
#note Final score 380-365 for me, due to the KHI underscore. 

This was probably my ugliest game of the tournament. Really bad performance on my part. I was lucky Ed didn't pull the trigger on TWEENIER*.
