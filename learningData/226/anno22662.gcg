#note ANODIZER+ for 86! Had not studied any new 8's yet though :(

>Chris_Tallman: ADENPRW C7 P.EDRAWN +86 118
>Chris_Tallman: ADENPRW --  -86 32
#note Already down 100, I decided to gamble with this - thought there was a decent chance it's good... Mike took a few minutes but eventually challenged.

#note Getting completely destroyed now :O
>Chris_Tallman: AEEEHIR 2J HAE +31 97
#note AERIE B10 keeping EH seems like my best (but still slim) shot. I missed that spot though, and would again to great cost.
>Mike_Frentz: BDNU 1L BUND +38 259
#note Was kinda tilted he had a B here after HAE
>Chris_Tallman: EEIIOOR -EIIOO +0 97

>Mike_Frentz: Q 5G Q. +11 299
>Chris_Tallman: EINOUVV 10A UN.OVE +16 190
#note Opening a desperation 3x3 spot; hopefully I can get some godlike draw and hit it 0.5% of the time lol? 4D VOW is simming best though, and it also fishes for one of the 3 T's for QIVIUT G5, which i didn't see this turn but stay tuned..
>Mike_Frentz: EGY N4 GEY +33 332
>Chris_Tallman: BCDILOV A8 CO.LD +30 220

>Mike_Frentz: EKN 4C KNE. +26 358
>Chris_Tallman: BIIOTTV M6 BIT +14 234
#note I now saw QIVIUT, this keeps VIT hoping for a small victory :P

>Chris_Tallman: ILNOTV 5B LION +26 260
#note Can't read my scoresheet for the full rack - VOLK C1 is probably best to try to hit a bingo or something..
