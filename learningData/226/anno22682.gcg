#note Note - dual commentary in this game. Any comments on Rafi's plays are by him.

Exchanged quite fast here, but GENII F9 is 5% better and would have stopped his bingo!
>Rafi_Stern: AADIRSU 9H SUDARIA +75 95
>Chris_Tallman: BEGINSU N9 .BUSING +32 32
#note Didn't know BIGUINES+ and it really cost me :( .. between ABUSING and BRUNG, it seems pretty even - being down 95-0, I wanted points though (not the best reasoning :| )
>Rafi_Stern: BEEGPWZ 13M W.Z +30 125
#note Didn't think of BEWIG which is better.
>Chris_Tallman: ?ADEOSW L3 DOWAgE.S +74 106
#note Missing DEAdWO(OD)S for 77! Debated between WAGE for 36 holding the blank and bingoing - after I searched in vain for a 3x3. Time was already down to like 14 min after this. 
>Rafi_Stern: BEEFGPY 15L YE.G +39 164
>Chris_Tallman: ACELNSV K2 VENAL +33 139
#note #1 simming play, but it does horrible things to the board...
>Rafi_Stern: BEEFHPU M1 FEH +32 196
>Chris_Tallman: CCEIMNS 6J C..IM +21 160
#note #1 simming play - I have the case S, so the CLAIMS spot is great for me
>Rafi_Stern: ABEMOPU 1M .UB +24 220
>Chris_Tallman: CEEGNRS O6 SEC +25 185
#note FUB neuters the CLAIMS spot, and I wanted to score - SEC is flipflopping with CENSER for 37, which I definitely would have played if I saw it. 
>Rafi_Stern: AEIMOPU 14M A.I +22 242
#note Haven't really had any interesting decisions yet...
>Chris_Tallman: EGLNNOR O1 .ONG +9 194
#note M8 L(I)ON, EGNR > ELNR
>Rafi_Stern: DELMOPU 2M .M. +18 260
#note So the OS spot has been sitting there all game, and really isn't that easy to deal with - although bingos there will essentially score face value. I considered PUMEL(OS) to deal with the spot - although I'm still floating an E in the 8th position and I'm throwing away some decent synergy. I think I'm better off scoring and holding a rack that plays pretty well through floaters if Chris does end up bingoing - and since there's hardly anywhere to play, it's reasonable that Chris' next play makes it easier for me to shut down the board.
>Chris_Tallman: AEFILNR 10F FIE +17 211
#note Was lost here. The best simming plays are this, exch F, and RIFLE for 19...
>Rafi_Stern: DELOPTU 11C PULED +24 284
#note Quackle hates PULED because of 5 T's unseen, but PULED gives Chris the lowest bingo % of any candidate play and it seems like he's been fishing and is more likely than random to have the blank. I decided against POUTED because of the hook, and LOUPED because of an additional good tile for 8s. PULED looked like the best 5 tile play in that spot. However, taking the points (and shedding a T) with DUPLETS is probably fine... with no esses and only one D unseen, the FIE lane isn't that threatening. There are a lot of horrible draws for me after PULED (20% of the pool are duplicates) that can leave me in a tricky situation next turn.
>Chris_Tallman: AALNNRT 12J RANT. +17 228
#note Saw RATAN B12, but felt that would give Rafi the chance to end the game by blocking the OSE hook... needed to open something else. Maybe TRAPAN/TARPAN? Of note - E8 NAL(OXO)N(E) for 17!
>Rafi_Stern: ELOORTV 12B VETO +24 308
#note I... suck.
>Chris_Tallman: AIIKLNO 13C NAOI +24 252
#note Opening a (bad) lane on 14 while keeping LIK for -LIKE bingos? Idk, its something
>Rafi_Stern: EILOORT J4 OR. +14 322
#note I played ORC over OOT on row 11 because it seemed important to keep the last O for the chance at JO/OPEN on a board where the J otherwise is horrendous. The pool is 7v 15c so leaving an extra vowel isn't terrible especially after NAOI.
>Chris_Tallman: ?IKLRTT E11 ...T +4 256
#note Didn't know KITTLER, which wins 23.76% vs about 10% for LOOT according to Q. Fishing for KLISTER here in both spots with an E (4/21) draw. Figured that without a T, it might be hard for Rafi to block the higher scoring lane as well. 
>Rafi_Stern: EILOPTT 14A PIT +16 338
#note Keeping the O for the same reason, as Chris almost never has the J after LOOT.
>Chris_Tallman: ?IJKLRT K11 J.R +20 276
#note Devastating one tile draw. Kolton (who was commentating) told me after that they checked and there aren't even any steals at all for IJKLRT!
>Rafi_Stern: EELNOTY 15A EN +20 358
>Chris_Tallman: ?DIKLQT 10A QIs +19 295
#note Figured that the only way I was ever shedding the Q was to use my blank, so I gave it up here. Missed  F6 QuIT(CLAIMS) for 42, which would have been awesome!
>Rafi_Stern: AEELOTY 14J EL +15 373
#note Weird spot... I didn't see a way to block all the bingos in the pool so I decided to score/set up a decent spot to make it easy to outrun any bingo.
