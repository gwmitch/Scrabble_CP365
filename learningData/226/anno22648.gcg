#note or JOB at 7C. there was no worthwhile way to save the CROQUET hook

#note NAIAD wins the sim by a few because it blocks a more dangerous lane on the board.

>JD: ADEEINR 2B .....E +11 118
#note the pool is unusually awesome, so fishing is devalued compared to what one might expect. I considered CROQUETED here, but any number of fishing plays are reasonable: OXEN, OXIDE or even AEDINE blowing up the rack sim better. I can also fish an E at 9J or 6J threatening a double-double next turn, although at the expense of a few points.

#note ackkkk this is not a word at all! crafty doug! I figured they must have added it in the update if doug was playing it.

>JD: ADESSSS J8 SADES +34 314
#note I liked the high-scoring lane that SADES created, but it also blocks row 13 and gives me a much, much weaker leave. saw SASS at J8 but passed it up - that's the play.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?ALNPPR 11H PR.PLANs +72 440
#note I challenged because there's surely no way to win after this. I thought that he was going to make the blank a T at first, giving me a triple-triple! but given his actual draw after this play, I was bound to lose.
>JD: EGINSST -  +0 314
#note I challenged out of desperation.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ABEGLRU M7 ARGU.BLE +78 518
#note 384 points in 5 turns! impressive.
