#note Was actually a bit unsure which spelling was good - they both are!
>John_Wiley: IJN G6 JI.N +13 13
>Chris_Tallman: ACEIMUY 10E UMIAC +27 53
#note The most interesting position of this game I think! I can play JUICY for 23 and set up my M, AECIUM/JINNI (which I missed) or this. JUICY does interfere with DJINNI, which it's pretty likely he has, but the M setup isn't great because any play there towards the right will likely give him big playback. I really like the long term board control of this play. There is one small issue with it that comes up later...
>John_Wiley: ELORT 6G .OLTER +15 28
>Chris_Tallman: AERRUXY 5H YEAR +27 80
#note The sim likes (M)UREX for 30, but this is definitely the play for me, great board control again.
>John_Wiley: EHKR 4J HERK +31 59
>John_Wiley: EHKR --  -31 28
>Chris_Tallman: GOQRTUX 7C GOX +27 107
#note Given the leave knowledge, I didn't want to give him a big reparallel with GOX J4... but even with a partial oppo rack, that placement is simming a bit higher - probaly beacuse after KAT there, the SKAT hook is bothersome, which is a problem GOX J4 avoids. Needed to look deeper here. 
>John_Wiley: EHH 11C HEH +28 56
>Chris_Tallman: AQRSTUU 4J QAT +39 146
#note I preferred QAT for 39 over QAT for 41 to take out the scoring area and Q agrees.. but QUARTS is 4% better it seems. 
>John_Wiley: IIKW 3K WIKI +31 87
#note So the thing about UMIAC earlier.. the UMIACK hook! KIWI there is 45!
>Chris_Tallman: ARSSTUU 2H URUS +14 160
#note Pretty funny to have left UU after playing QAT and now I'm dealing withe aftermath. I passed up URSA to leave AST, but the sim disagrees pretty strongly with me. I felt more comfortable playing URUS with the X not out at least... O1 TUSSUR for 33 looks like a great play too (I didn't know it) I think that's best.
>John_Wiley: BF H1 F.B +24 111
>Chris_Tallman: AAILNST O1 INSTAL +33 193
#note TA(XI) for 22 leaves quite a potent leave. I saw it, but felt that playing defense and running was more important at this score. Q agrees with me.
>John_Wiley: DOT 12B TOD +19 130
>Chris_Tallman: ABCEEMO H10 .MOEBA +33 226
#note Didn't like throwing open the board when he has likely a strong range, but TOD opened the board anyway and I can't completely shut it down. AMOEBA looks best

#note Can make the blank a K or a Y here!

#note No! (Still 100% win though)
>John_Wiley: EPT 14B PET +29 217

#note Don't a full rack here. Passed up YER A15 to get greedy for another bingo.
