#note I saw OTTAR at 10F, but I thought this would be a good time to open and try to take advantage of my strong leave. but AIRT only bingos 28% versus 14% with IR, so I probably overestimated the strength of my leave.

#note SEZ indicated to me that there was a decent chance he had the last S. In that case, I really liked blocking all the S hooks on the board (row 13 and column N), at the cost of a slightly worse rack. the play that sims better is WIFEY/VIA at F8, which is pretty tricky! but I am OK with my choice, since I may never get a better opportunity to block while still having good equity.

>JD: ADDIPTU 15N UP +17 206
#note how much am I willing to sacrifice here to keep blocking? his play strongly signals either a blank or an S. however, a lot of bingos he might have will also fit on the bottom-left side, so I shouldn't sacrifice too much. the alternative is playing something like DUI, PTUI or PADI at K3. I think my other moves are mediocre to the point that UP is justified.

>JD: ADDEITW C9 DAWED +32 238
#note with 6 more Is to come, it would be good to play mine. I liked keeping the board tight given his increasingly fishy plays. But perhaps I should consider WADI at K3. Even though he's been fishing a lot, DET is not a terrible leave to open up with, and if he does bingo I at least have some chance at bingoing back. instead I opted to turn the game into as much of a slugfest as I could.

#note my only chance of victory at this point is if he somehow misses his fish and I pull either the blank or the S off of my exchange. otherwise I am in huge trouble. hence x7. I could keep a T, I guess.
>Rafi_Stern: ?ACENRT 15F RECANTs +77 340
#note in retrospect, had I seen this as a potential play then I could've played DAWTED to save me the ability to block this lane if he created it. but unfortunately I didn't have that kind of foresight this time around.

#note I'm toast. I can play GASLIT to cut spread and pray rafi gets confused and doesn't block some miracle outbingo. the only -SL- play possible given the bag is MISLABEL. I played BIOTONES* hoping that rafi might block on column I and leave me a bingo through -LI- to go out. what else is worth trying??
