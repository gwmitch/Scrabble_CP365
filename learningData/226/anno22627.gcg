>Joshua_Sokol: BDDKMOR G2 BORK +29 92
#note Looks like the BDM leave in DORK ends up tying the DDM leave +2 points in my play, probably since I7 (WE)B overlaps help my rack out next turn.
>Leah_Kruley: GI J2 GI +20 52
#note Leah said I blocked a very nice 9 through IN on my play. But I forget what word.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADDMRT I7 DAM +23 115
#note BAM keeping DART would have scored 27, and would not be easily hooked. I'm liking DORK last turn!
>Leah_Kruley: ?CEEOTV F6 COVETEd +84 136
>Joshua_Sokol: ADLRRTU 9D RU.D +16 131
#note This turn, I was being more proactive than I needed to be. I also doubted the word DURAL, because DATAL is Collins-only. That is definitely my play at E9. This sets up my T, but gives back much in the process.

#note As I was playing this, Conrad walked by. He said he thought I was going to try 15A (U)nTRUELY*. I completely missed that, and it makes sense as a word, if TRUELY* were valid.

#note 2G (BINGE)ING is my play. Did not know that to be valid. But of course it is. As is SINGEING and TINGEING and HINGEING*--- whoops, not that one, and WHINGEING, and LUNGEING, and LONGEING, and TWINGEING, and SWINGEING, SPRINGEING, SPONGEING. Oh, no RANGEING* VENGEING* AVENGEING*. Anyways, go English!
>Leah_Kruley: ENORRST N6 .ORRENTS +60 273
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIINPW B12 W.IN +20 329
#note Regretted not play O13 HIP here. I'm sacrificing too many points for an area of the board that's quite difficult for Leah to use to her advantage.
>Leah_Kruley: IZ 13I ZI. +22 295
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEHIOP O7 HEED +40 369
#note Now not that her play changed anything, but it seemed to tell me she didn't have an S. That was very good news for me, smooth sailing ahead it would seem.
>Leah_Kruley: INX M12 NIX +30 325
>Joshua_Sokol: FILOPSS J13 .F +13 382
#note well, perhaps not! I have to block LINGUAE and UNAGILE! So I decided to go for a bingo of my own. Problem is, I can't draw into anything. But I didn't know that! :P
>Leah_Kruley: AAEGILU 15K AGE +17 342
#note 6B AULI(C) first. I'm scoring a lot at O1 as well, no need to block IFS
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNOPSS 7D SN.... +10 392
#note Missed OPSINS on my rack, so -5 to 7E L(OWED)
>Leah_Kruley: AILU M4 .A. +6 348
#note Leah had around one minute left on her clock, hence the imperfect endgame.
