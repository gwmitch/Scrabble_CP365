>Joshua_Sokol: EEEEIWW H4 WEEWEE +32 32
#note I really enjoyed playing Emely. She gives a great game and was quite talkative. She enjoyed my opening play and told me a story about how in one game, Dave Wiegand had to extend WEED somehow to win and extended it to WEE(WEED)! Here I was thinking I was the only person at this board who knew the hooks to WEEWEE!
>Emely_Weissman: ?EEGIPR 5C PERIG.Es +70 70
#note Emely played this after a long while, kibitzing that she "couldn't find it if it was there". I know that feeling all too well. I showed her 8A PEdIGRE(E) after the game. I only saw that because I was recently in a position with a rack of EEEGIPR, and the only 8s with that rack are PERIGEES and PEDIGREE.
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIILNO C5 .OLICING +67 99
#note PEDIGREE would have worked out less well for Emely, though, as POLICING then scores 31 more!
>Emely_Weissman: FO 6F FO. +30 100
#note I wrote down on my scoresheet that I was 77% sure POLICING did not take an S.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHLLOV 8A OL.VE +36 135
>Emely_Weissman: AILORST G8 TAILORS +64 164
#note Good thing I didn't play HOVEL 6J! Another position where Emely missed a tough one. I only saw A8 (O)STIOLAR because I just studied that probability... It also helps to not be the person in the real-game position.
>Joshua_Sokol: BBEHHLO 6J HOBBLE +35 170
#note Hmm, F10 HEH is a lot of points! It also would have given me some really cool bingo opportunities if I was lucky. BOMBLOAD, BLUEBOOK, LOBBYGOW, BOBOLINK, BLOWJOBS are a few through the O. BLESBOKS, SORBABLE, SUBBLOCK, LOBBYISM, SNOBBILY are a few through the S!
>Emely_Weissman: ACFIR O1 FARCI. +42 206
>Joshua_Sokol: AHIIKTU 14B HAIKU. +30 200
#note F9 KHAT is 43, but that leave does not work out well for me!
>Emely_Weissman: GZ 10B Z.G +33 239
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIITTY 15A YETT +34 234
>Emely_Weissman: DDO 10F D.DO +24 263
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINORT 9A RE.IT +30 264
#note really trying to grind my way back into this game!
>Emely_Weissman: MTTU 11I MUTT +16 279
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINNOQ L1 NIQAA. +36 300
#note With one remaining I, L1 NIQAA(B) puts pressure on the person that does not draw it for an easy 40 points. In that sense, I should have sacrificed 2 points for a safer positioning with M1 NIQAA(B), perhaps.
>Emely_Weissman: ADRV D1 DRAV. +22 301
>Joshua_Sokol: INOX M2 NIX +53 353
#note I do not have my leave for this play, but it's 3 of MPRSY?. So it's fair to assess that this was the right play! Very lucky to draw that I, especially with the X!
>Emely_Weissman: JNOU L8 JUN.O +40 341
>Joshua_Sokol: ?MOPRSY 12A PO.Y +26 379
#note But Emely will not give up. I was in a tough position here. Definitely in good shape, but still, there was a lot to think about. I was debating early on between emptying and not emptying the bag. It looked like I could outrun a bingo if I played (J)OYS over PROSY/JUNTOS, so I discarded PROSY as a candidate play. But it looked very close in that regard. I would have to score over 30 points next turn and leave one on my rack to outscore an 80-point bingo. Emely getting a bingo down was definitely the only way I could see myself losing.

(R)ENNASES and NAUSEAS play on row 13. DEA(D)NESS, NU(D)ENESS and DU(D)ENESS(!) play on row 1, and SA(R)DANAS, DEA(R)NESS, NEA(R)NESS, UNE(R)ASED, and ANU(R)ESES play on row 2. If I play (J)OYS, I am allowing for (S)ANENESS while blocking (L)EANNESS, a mathematical cancellation.

In face of all these threats, it seemed natural to deviate towards another form of safety net. If Emely hits one of those bingos, I will most likely hit one of my own, since I'll be drawing an A for sure, and two other tiles to my MRS? leave. Leaving tiles in the bag was also not an issue because it didn't look at all probable that a one-tile fish would hit in multiple spots on this board. In fact, the only one that hits is (L)EANNESS/NEA(R)NESS/(R)ENNASES.

So I ended up deciding on this play. Quackle suggests (G)YP in the same spot to keep the O, which makes sense. I am very interested in hearing your thoughts on this position, though, because there is a whole lot to think about, and I don't think I have adequately analyzed everything here.
>Emely_Weissman: ADENSU 1B UN.EADS +27 368
#note What a fantastic play! Emely was pretty sure this was invalid, but she knew that the only way for her to win was if I got confused and challenged this, losing my turn. I didn't bite here, and I regret it, because I know UNDEADS is phony! But you can only be so sure... 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEMRSS M9 MAShERS +89 468
#note This was the word I was surest of, but MASSiER and MASSEuR play for 90.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (AN) +4 472
