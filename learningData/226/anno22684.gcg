#note This felt like a stupid play, but there actually isn't too much else. Strangely ED 11A is the only play with a 100% winning percentage. I guess Emely wins when she plays JOW next at 14A and then bingos on row 15 and maybe her last play is JO for 27 while I get stuck with the consonants?

>cecilia: CHIMNPR 14A HM +30 419
#note I made this play to block JOWS, figuring she can only bingo if J is in the bag, and if that's the case there's no way to block the S hook on ELM anyway. After I take away row 14 she may have a hard time playing the J at all. However, championship player prefers I just drop the M at 14B and I have no idea why! Maybe because OHM gives back more for Emely, and if I keep the H I can dump URCHIN or something at N7?

#note J's in the bag. Bad luck for me, but you might say I enabled this unpleasant ending when I played HEM.
