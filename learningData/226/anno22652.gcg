#note Right or not, I remember playing MO instead of ME so I might get some sort of crazy 2x2 on column E (METAGES or MENAGES?). Top simming are MYOID 14B and EMO B13, both of which I think open too much on a relatively constricted board.

>cecilia: ABDEEIS M9 BIASED +38 270
#note I'm happy with this play. It widens the gap by a bingo again, forces any bingo from him into a weak lane with a big comeback, and digs deeper for the blank.

>cecilia: CEFKLOW H13 OWL +23 293
#note Difficult turn! I could play FLOCK now to go ahead by 98, but that seemed like leaving too much to chance. A big bingo on row 15 or column O would pull him almost even, leaving me at the mercy of whatever's left in the bag. OWL seemed to put the situation more in my control, since I have scoring tiles to counter a bingo on column N, but is this assessment wrong?  FLOCK is simming 94% to win and OWL 92%.

>cecilia: CEEFKOR N13 ROC +18 311
#note This continues to be super interesting. He holds bingos on column O 17% of the time and can't touch the spot at O1, so I decided to block keeping KEEF to threaten. However, ROC only wins 75%! The best option is CREDO 14J, which wins 86% of games - slightly better than playing KEEF now.
