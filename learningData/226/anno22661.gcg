>Chris_Tallman: ILLOOOR 8H OLIO +8 8
#note exch 6 keeping R is simming best, 2% above OLIO
>Paul_Mishkin: AIIO I5 AIO.I +7 7
#note I guess we both had similar first racks!
>Chris_Tallman: AGGLNOR H1 LOGAN +23 31
#note ARGOL/GORAL keep NG together, which is better than GR despite the fact that R > N
>Paul_Mishkin: EH 7K HE +10 17
#note I was confused & concerned after this play, especially since I didn't have a great counter in this spot.
>Chris_Tallman: EGLMNRT 5E REG..NT +32 63
#note Was focused on dealing with the HE spot, and was debating GERM vs MINGLE H9 when I noticed the 2x2 spot and immediately played REGNANT. REMNANT was also playable there and is 4 points more and a better play.
>Paul_Mishkin: ITZ M7 TIZ +30 47
#note First put it at L6 for 34 then switched to this placement. 
>Chris_Tallman: EELMNQR 3H .ERMEN +20 83
#note There are some other options here, but this one seems like it creates a long-term tight board, which I like, having a decent lead at this point. 
>Paul_Mishkin: DOORTUY -  +0 47
#note challenged GERMEN
>Chris_Tallman: ADLMPQU F5 .QUAL +34 117
#note QU(O)D F2 is very clear and an inexplicable miss - I miss that spot later on in the game too :(
>Paul_Mishkin: EY 9K YE. +24 71
>Chris_Tallman: BCDKMNP 8M .CK +27 144
#note KNOB, same spot as QUOD. I considered DUMBO E7, but rejected it because I didn't want to interfere with the PREGNANT line, which is a pretty dumb reason. The leave after ICK is horrible. 
>Paul_Mishkin: INRTU 8A NUTRI. +21 92
>Chris_Tallman: BFGMNPR B6 GR.MP +20 164
#note Was doubting FRUMP (thought maybe only FRUMPY) and made the 'safer' play. BUMF was also a decent option here - holding the P for PREGNANT. 
>Paul_Mishkin: IVW L1 VI.W +28 120
>Chris_Tallman: ABDFPRS D2 FRAP +29 193
#note Luckbox draw of another P (and an S)
>Paul_Mishkin: BJ H7 J.B +25 145
>Chris_Tallman: BDESUUY 10B .UBES +28 221
#note This is the right idea; this board is now very dead and I'm up a bingo. But PUDUS+ leaves BEY instead of DUY and does the same thing. Those new wordzzzz :O
>Paul_Mishkin: AFN 10J FAN +26 171
#note This play is kind of nuts considering there are 3 S'S remaining and I just played one for 27 - but he has to try something. 
>Chris_Tallman: CDLRTUY L9 ..TRY +16 237
#note Considered CURDY/CURLY B3 but eventually decided to do something about the HOYAS spot. FLUTY J10 seems like a much better way of doing that though. 
>Paul_Mishkin: ADIS 11K S.AID +34 205
#note I was definitely okay with 34 from him here, as his play also further shuts down the board. 
>Chris_Tallman: CDHILOU O11 .OLCI +27 264
#note DOLCI gives him nothing and obstructs the X spot at N10 and the bingo lane through the Y while holding the H to score - it looks like the best play. 
>Paul_Mishkin: ??AADEN O2 mANDrA.E +62 267
#note Very interesting position here, where bingoing on a very closed board might not be correct for him! C1 DEAN holding A?? is simming best - it keeps the O line to K open (for a better scoring bingo hopefully), as well as the line to the Y (which is very hard to block). Stll a nice find by him though, the only bingo here. 
>Chris_Tallman: DDEEHUX 11C HEX +53 317
>Paul_Mishkin: OVW 3C V.OW +20 287
>Chris_Tallman: DDEESTU 13L .E +10 327
#note Paranoid here, nothing plays to the Y in the pool but I didn't trust my tracking :(
>Paul_Mishkin: AEOT A3 TOEA +8 295
>Chris_Tallman: DDIOSTU D8 .O..D +16 343
#note -10
>Paul_Mishkin: EES 1K E.ES +7 302
#note My first very low scoring win this tourney - there would be others :P
