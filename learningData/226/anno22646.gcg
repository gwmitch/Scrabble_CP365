#note he evidently missed HUSSARS on this turn!
>JD: ILNOTUW 15A WIL. +30 189
#note chicekened out of OWLY, the new 4. TOWY actually sims really well too, a bit surprisingly.

>JD: EIKNOTU 8J .UNKET +33 222
#note SOUK looks tempting, but on a tight board the EINT leave is unlikely to do much.
>David_Whitley: GIINV L4 VINI.G +20 246
#note I held for awhile. this looked unfamiliar.
>JD: ADIOOQT I2 QADI +16 238
#note biggest error of the game - best to hold the Q this turn and play OOTID at 14J to set up a new Q spot. there are also three Us left and a QI spot, so holding the Q is nice.
>David_Whitley: ABBEI 4D BABIE. +24 270
>JD: ALLOOPT 5B POOL +20 258
#note I now threaten three big scores - X plays at 14A, the S hook on POOL and drawing the blank. I figured that as long as two of those happen I have a good chance of winning.

#note I have a chance!
>David_Whitley: AGNNOTU N5 ON +10 376
#note this is his actual rack. there are very few good options. perhaps the best shot is to block the E on row 2 with UN and hope that it cripples my rack 
>JD: CEHRUUV 2K CURV. +20 397
#note this play and ERUV win 6/8. I liked this play because it guarantees a nice scoring H play for next turn, simplifying the endgame (as usual, I was way too low on time). the trouble is that david has just fished, and can now have either TUTORAGE or TETRAGON. ERUV blocks both and loses only to perfect endgame play: if the G is in the bag, I lose to the devastating QUERN and then TAO/RAVINING combo, while if I draw the U I would lose to GROVE followed by NEAT. but these are very tough endgames to spot, so I effectively cost myself almost 25% of a win.
>David_Whitley: AEGNRTU 11J .UGAR +12 388
#note it seems like he should have some winning sequence down only 21, but there simply aren't enough scoring plays. DUG at J13 guarantees an out next turn, but loses by 11.
>JD: EHOU 12K HOE +25 422
>David_Whitley: ENT 15H .ENT +4 392
#note he can stick me with the U by playing ET.
