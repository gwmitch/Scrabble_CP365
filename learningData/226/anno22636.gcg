#note I proudly proclaim that I actually saw all of the 4 possible bingos here. I less proudly proclaim that I decided against play EKTExI(N)E because it wasn't the best play. So what?! I love that word!

#note missed the two plays I could have made, L10 PIDDLY and DIDDLY. I should definitely have played PIDDLY.
>Daniel_Novinson: EIRRSTV O8 VI. +24 143
#note Daniel missed RIVETERS here. Neither of us knew RESTRIVE, so he would have gotten a free turn if that had come down. What a weird word.
>Joshua_Sokol: BELNPSV 14F BL.EP +21 160
#note Deserved to draw poorly after my mistaken exchange.
>Daniel_Novinson: ERRSTW N10 ..WER +22 165
#note nicely setting up his S.
>Joshua_Sokol: FINOSTV 15L FIST +45 205
#note Unfortunately I had one of my own.
>Daniel_Novinson: DGST 13M G.D +10 175
>Joshua_Sokol: AENOVXY K4 AXON +33 238
#note I'm thinking I shouldn't have been so aggro here. 9F VA(S) keeps things under control and closes the left side indefinitely. And perhaps it allows me to use A(VAS)* or challenge it off, but I doubt that. Daniel is a strong player. Anyways, it was early, so I went for spread. 
>Daniel_Novinson: ISTT L4 TIT +29 204
#note Missing T(AXON) as we discussed afterwards, which of course was part of my plan. Just kidding, I lucked out.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHQUVY 15B HEAVY +22 260
#note Really weird that I missed QUEA(N) here. Especially since COT(QUEAN) is a thing that perhaps my opponent would overlook. This was definitely a mistake.
>Daniel_Novinson: CDRU 14A CURD +29 233
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINQTU G2 QUANTI.E +82 342
#note And yet I get rewarded. Once again this game, I am ashamed to have been such a greedy bastard in taking the best bingo, when something far cooler was available. Do you see it? You think I'll ever get the opportunity to play that again?
>Daniel_Novinson: ACEGS -  +0 233
#note challenged. Not a word that comes up often
>Joshua_Sokol: AANOPRY H3 PYA +27 369
#note or M7 YAPO(K) for the spread
>Daniel_Novinson: ACEEGOS M1 CAGES +29 262
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNORR 1L A.RO +21 390
#note I forgot if OR(C)IN was good or not, and just flat out missed everything else. I knew I was missing stuff too. Bad bad.

>Daniel_Novinson: AILN B7 LAIN +17 294
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGNOOW M9 WO. +22 451
#note Very lazy endgame. I assumed he wouldn't block GENOA for some reason.
>Daniel_Novinson: BMNRSU 8A ..RM +12 306
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGNO 7E AG.O +13 464
#note And also I forgot E(LAIN)! Oh gosh that's bad. I also thought this was a cute block, but it wasn't.
>Daniel_Novinson: BNSU 6B SNUB +19 325
#note I thought he would miss BUNAS, but he saw the other thing. I probably lost around 30 spread in this endgame, or more. There goes that idea of playing for spread this game.
