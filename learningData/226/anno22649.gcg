#note tricky play, lots of options. I liked setting up scoring plays for my K next turn. the only other thing I saw that looked kind of reasonable was PAGODA, but KT is hardly a stellar leave on an open board.

#note jeez, epic drawing, but this is actually an error because I can play VIRUS and keep the blank! I was too fixated on offloading the J.
