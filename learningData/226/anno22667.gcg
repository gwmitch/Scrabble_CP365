>Chris_Guilbert: EEIJT 8H EEJIT +26 26
#note This was the game of TWL15
>Chris_Tallman: DEHORTT 9I HOT +30 30
#note TROTHED!
>Chris_Guilbert: ILOP L4 PILO. +14 40
>Chris_Tallman: ADENORT 5G DERAT.ON +68 98
#note Somehow the new word is the only one of 4 anagrams that play here. I hadn't studied any new 8's, but luckily I did know this one!
>Chris_Guilbert: AKOW H1 AWOK. +51 91
#note Quite the response tho...
>Chris_Tallman: EIIOOST O1 OTIOSE +31 129
#note O(L)IO for 14 leaves the potent IEST and sims very closely with OTIOSE - my style is to take the scoring play usually though - and this board isn't super great for bingoing... idk
>Chris_Guilbert: ADIR M1 RADI. +16 107
>Chris_Tallman: AEEIINY I3 YA.E +26 155
#note I have the chance to play another TWL15 word, AIYEE.. also EYEN for 31.. that leaves AII and hangs an E in the 2x2 lane though... YARE is simming best.
>Chris_Guilbert: X J5 .X +50 157
#note Was regretting it after this though!
>Chris_Tallman: ACEEIIN 6C NIECE +16 171
#note Pretty gross turn here... Maybe exchanges are better (EI or EII)?.. or maybe AECI(A) for just 8 - it certainly gives much less back.
>Chris_Guilbert: LNUV 5B VULN +22 179
#note Moar new words
>Chris_Tallman: AIIMPRT 2J IMP.R. +24 195
#note Some fishing plays are possible (PIMA, PILI).. but seems like a poor board to fish on. Also possible is the aggressive MI(LI)TIA leaving PR.. i'm happy with my conservative choice though.
>Chris_Guilbert: ADNS M8 SAND +19 198
#note Weird play, he must have another S, maybe SAD or SAN leave?
>Chris_Tallman: AAIIOTY -AIOYAIT +0 195
#note Lots of plays are possible here - OATY for 23, A(LI)YOT, OI(D)IA.. but I went with a read on his most likely leave from SAND that he didn't have a blank (else he very likely bingoes last turn) and traded all 7 here to go for them. The plays all have equity valuations of 10.4 or less.. the sim doesn't like my exchange,  but I kind of do. Thoughts?
>Chris_Guilbert: CRZ 1F CZ.R +15 213
#note Maybe DRS leave? Not an A or CZARS comes down...
>Chris_Tallman: ABEFFRU 11H BUFFE. +30 225
>Chris_Guilbert: EINNRST I11 .N +2 215
#note I'm pretty sure this was his rack. CP likes (B)RENT for 24 best.. hmm. UN sims pretty well too, but DEN G5 sims higher by 2%. Maybe UN makes things easier to shut down? VI- plays or something? idk, thoughts here?
>Chris_Tallman: AAGIMRS 12D MAGIA. +25 250
#note (Z)AG leaving AMIRS is possible, to try to counter-bingo.. I felt like a) interfering with his lane and b) drawing more tiles for the blanks. MARGI(N) jumps ahead on the sim several % ahead of MAGIA(N) (and ZAG is in between) when partial oppo rack is SATIRE..not sure why.
>Chris_Guilbert: EIINRST F8 STIN.IER +63 278
>Chris_Tallman: ??BGRSU 15D BU.GheRS +86 336
#note Finally, justice in the form of the very welcome blanks! Also, burgers are tasty :)
>Chris_Guilbert: Q 10E Q. +11 289
>Chris_Tallman: ELOOTUW L11 .EW +12 348
#note The sim is hating my play, and I can see why - I mistracked the I's and thought UNI I13 was a threat! Furthermore, this leaves badly, and if he scores 50+ at A8 I could be in trouble - yikes!
>Chris_Guilbert: EHLOY 8A HOYLE. +39 328
#note It could have been worse...
>Chris_Tallman: DELOTUV 13A VOLE +18 366
#note I was only 99% sure on OUTLOVED at this moment. Umm...  (yes, I did see it) :(
>Chris_Guilbert: AAG G1 .AG +29 357
#note -2 to just going out with AGHA
>Chris_Tallman: DTU E10 .U. +28 394
>Chris_Guilbert: A N5 .A +8 365
#note I missed a lot of stuff this game, but still some really interesting moves!
>Chris_Guilbert:  (DT) +6 371
