#note Round 2.  After my round 1 slog, I saw this opening rack, put the auto-pilot best play down and thought fore sure that things would be different this game.  Little did I know what awaited me.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: FOTU 9F TOFU +29 29
>Jim_Burlant: EGLPTTZ -GLPT +0 32
#note I saw J6 PLY for 14 and rejected it, as I couldn't wrap my arms around the EGTTZ leave.  Never saw H7 TOFT.  If you don't do either of those plays, exchanging is right.  Q says that if I'm going to exchange I should also keep the P here on the exchange...whatever.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?DEEEOV -?DE +0 29
>Jim_Burlant: ACEETUZ 10D UTA +9 41
#note Some positions have obvious good plays, and then there are positions like this where you're trying to decide which version of suck you can live with.  Apparently I should keep the U and play 7F ZA.  I sort of see that because that option gives absolutely nothing back.  CUTEY is also reasonable.  Not sure how I missed it.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ANW 11D NAW +24 53
>Jim_Burlant: CEEHIJZ E10 ..J +10 51
#note Almost exchanged and then I saw this at the last minute.  This is best.  47% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DF H7 D..F +11 64
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEHIZ J5 HAZ. +21 72
#note Obviously a J column play is indicated, but which one? This outscores all my other options and I figured I should just unload the Z before it became an albatross around my neck.  Q says that J6 HEY is the play...I dunno about that.  Maybe J5 CHAY?  The sim thinks this is horrendous due to leave.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GMU K3 GUM +26 90
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEITW 7F WA. +14 86
#note It's either this or 3I WIG.  Even though I have a T, there's still too much else out there that can front hook WIG at H1. I'm fine with this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ARV 9B VAR +10 100
>Jim_Burlant: CEEEINT 3K .EE +8 94
#note EVICTEE scores 28 but the board position is reckless.  ZEE 7J scores 12 but again, the board position is awful, as it gives back way too many easy plays at 8L.  Hence, this.  Q can't decide whether or not it likes this, ZEE, or EVICTEE best.  I'd make this play again.  44% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?ANRSSV 11H SoVRANS +80 180
>Jim_Burlant: CEILNOT N4 LECTION. +68 162
#note Note to self:  make sure there aren't any anagrams of the bingo you're putting down.  TELSONIC at N8 scores 74 to this play's 68 and is clearly superior.  That said I'm still in the hole:  this wins 27%, and TELSONIC wins 3% more often and sims 5 points better.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEGI M9 BI.GE +31 211
#note Consolation:  if I put down TELSONIC he's still got BICE coming back for 33 on row 15.
>Jim_Burlant: DIKQRRS 14K DIRK +27 189
#note BINGE hurt a LOT, as I'd intended to play either QAID or QIS depending on what the board offered, and he killed both of those.  This was risky, but I figured that I had the S, and maybe I'd draw into a Q play somewhere in a couple of turns?  Q says SKIRR is slightly better, presumably for the extra turnover to chase the blank.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EHOS O12 HOSE +43 254
#note Damn, he's got the S.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIOQRS O3 QI +15 204
#note Strong play but not best. While I obviously have to dump the Q, it also helps to consider all the possibilities so as to make your tiles more synergistic with the board.  Better would have been to play at 13J for 14 points (this scores 15) to set up the row 15 S hook since I'm sitting on the case S.  Nonetheless, given my next two racks it wouldn't have mattered.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACEEP 15G PEACE +30 284
>Jim_Burlant: DEMORSY 2L YOM +23 227
#note The only place I have available to bingo right now is the B column, and if I don't give him a significant distraction, he'll extend the V at B9 and kill the southeast in a single turn.    This unloads the Y and M and he can't let row 1 stay open.  Q says I had the right idea but didn't need to be as bold with this. Q says I5 OY is best, and there is some merit to it  as it sets up the S hook...but  DEMRS is a hair too consonant overloaded for my tastes.  Regardless of whether you agree with me, this worked out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: LNOO I2 NOLO +13 297
#note I caught Sam in a bind - he obviously didn't have a row 1 play, and he knew he had to take that out.    Now I have more lines for 8's to work with.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIIRS B3 DERISI.E +66 293
#note Only bingo, but it's still bleak.  This improves my chances from 10% to 27.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DNU 1M DUN +20 317
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGITT H1 GATE +25 318
#note I wondered about what to do here - I figured there was a reasonable shot at a bingo and thought that if the bingo didn't come, I could take the chance on hoping to draw into an A8 play of some sort.  Statically this does very well, but not so much in the sim.  Apparently I should take out A8 now.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?EINOPT A4 NETOP +45 362
#note Actual rack - he realized on his next turn he'd missed PImENTO on row 14.  Apparently A1 OPINE is best, but this is still a very nice play and against my next rack this is enough to win.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRRT A10 ARTIER +23 341
#note Or AIRIER in the same location.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?ILL C11 gILL +12 374
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha:  (I) +2 376
#note Not perfectly played on my end, but my gut feel about this one says that, if I played better I might have lost by 10 - 15 instead of 35.  There was just too much garbage in the early game.  I feel like I accomplished something just by making a fight out of this when it could have easily turned into a blowout.
