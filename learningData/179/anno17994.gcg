>Kristiina: ?EFIILR 8D FIRELIt +76 76
>Chris: AIORTTU H1 TUTORIA. +77 77
#note Saved by the bel(L) hehe.. originally just saw the TOURISTA possibility when it was her turn 
>Kristiina: AEIMU F7 U.EMIA +14 90
#note She really likes her open boards it seems
>Chris: BHOQTTU 12A QUOTH. +56 133
#note Careful what you wish for though!
>Kristiina: DEINRSS 11F .NSIDERS +68 158
#note DIRENESS A9 is pretty nice here. SUNDRIES G2  is 76 too
>Chris: ABGJOTW B11 J.BA +26 159
#note Missed JABOT C9 because of paranoia about A12 Q plays :(. Saw JOWAR D5 for 30 and rejected it but yeah, this is really bad :(
>Kristiina: GLR 6G G.RL +7 165
#note I feel super lucky. Lucky #7!
>Chris: EGIORTW I2 TOWE. +21 180
#note I wanted to close the board against Kriistina again but just no. SWORE H11, WOOER C10... Giving up 7% win here for for vague reasons is not justified at all
>Kristiina: EHOR H11 .HORE +36 201
#note How much do I deserve this?
>Chris: CGIOP L9 CO.GI +16 196
#note Don't have my full rack here. I didn't know PISCO, but I'm trying to continue my board shaping here and maybe the leave with this is better
>Kristiina: AK A14 KA +24 225
>Chris: BDILPST 13K B.D +12 208
#note Considered BLIP J13 and BOP G13 but PILST seemed like the best bet to bingo through the E at H15 or possibly the T at H1 (less likely). The problem with this is after an obvious fish like this, H15 is going to be blocked a lot of the time and G13-G15 is a convenient spot to score while doing so. BIDI K13 is more aggressive as it opens another big spot and there's only one S left, but PLST is a more volative leave that can turn bad more often so idk
>Kristiina: NOO G13 NOO +11 236
#note Blocking the best lane as expected, but scores little in the process, which allows me to think about switching plans and trying to outscore. I'm getting the closed board I wanted at least, now let's see what I can do with it.
>Chris: ILNPSTW 14F W..T +15 223
#note Played WORT > WORN because the T clashes with the T at H1 for bingos. This is simming best, with WORN in the same spot second. Haven't switched plans quite yet, I suppose
>Kristiina: AEL 10D LA.E +8 244
#note I don't rly need to add anything, do I? :)
>Chris: EILNPSZ N12 ZIP +35 258
#note Needlessly risky and 4% down. I'm such a putz. I did like the ZIPS setup but :(
>Kristiina: ENS O13 SEN +21 265
#note Blocking both spots at once, but sacrificing probably too much to do it. Playing kamikaze style for a bit induced a favorable response I guess hehe
>Chris: AELNSTV J1 VANE +23 281
#note Thought of fishing with VOW G4, but couldn't think of words that fit with AELNST? + T (there are none), so I figured that was a pointless thing to do. VANE is simming best, but scoring spots on this board are now so sparse that I was worried a big triple play with the V could leave me in a bad position after it. I think VOWEL for 11, setting up the S, is maybe a better option, as blocking it likely will score little and open up further spots for me. 
>Kristiina: ERY C12 .YER +35 300
#note That was really not a welcome thing to happen here, but at least she didn't use the V and leave me with no playback.
>Chris: AEILSTU 1J .ITALS +30 311
#note Taking the spot and not fishing was right, but I need to visualize stuff better. I was getting pretty low on time though
>Kristiina: IX 2M XI +31 331
#note I'm not sure what she had. but this seems like a pretty poor use of a pretty important tile to have in this type of game since M3 at least neutralizes the X here.
>Chris: AEGNNUV 3L GENU +33 344
#note A bunch of stuff is close here. I liked getting rid of the U, but VENA is 4 more points so idk
>Kristiina: DMO 4M DOM +32 363
>Chris: ?AAENVY K4 dAY +25 369
#note This and a bunch of other plays win 100%. Mostly this game just came down to the draws at the end though. This threatens VANE A7 to go out and she can't counter effectively with FEPCD
>Kristiina: CDEFP 7C FE +14 377
#note Blocking VANE but now she can't capitalize on the opening I'm forced to make
>Chris: AENV 6A AVE +19 388
#note ... Or not! I spent my remaining 3 minutes retracking and making sure she had PCD so that I could play AVE safely and didn't take the time to find VEG G4! If I found a tracking error, hopefully I would have found it in time...
>Kristiina: CDP A5 C.P +7 384
>Chris: N 10K N. +4 392
#note I shaped the game into the style I wanted, but sacrificed too much to make it happen probably. Still nice to finish the tourney with a win and sneak into 4th place and win a prize after being 5-6 after 11 though!
>Chris:  (D) +4 396
