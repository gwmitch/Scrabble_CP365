#note With a blank, JAY should be better.  Y is not a good bingo tile here.  There's also the question of HAJI at G or E.  Given his one-tile keep, he should be more likely than usual to have an S, so I went with the far placement.

#note Debated which was more like to be valid: BEERILY or LEERILY.  I was wrong, but no matter.
>Shannon_B: ADKLR N2 DARKL. +32 56
>E_Tran: CGQRSUY L4 GYR.C +28 157
#note More unnecessary unintentional phoneys.  This play keeps a good leave, and lets me draw into Q words at 5 with the right vowels.  It also blocks off the botom right.  So many advantages, I forgot to consider it wasn't a word
>Shannon_B: BELO O1 LOBE +31 87
>E_Tran: EEEQRSU 5I QUE. +32 189
#note Too bad the Z wasn't somewhere open
>Shannon_B: ADDO M1 DADO +33 120
>E_Tran: EEOORSU 1H SOURE. +24 213
#note No point keeping bingo tiles.  Taking the points here looks fine -- especially while blocking a juicy spot.

>E_Tran: AAAGIRV A8 .AV +6 273
#note Tough spot.  Do I block for 6 points, or just make a usual play.  I opt for the paranoid block.
>Shannon_B: FILNT 2F FLINT +26 182
>E_Tran: AAGINPR 10E ....ARING +14 287
#note This block I am happy with.

>E_Tran: AADFOPT B2 APOD +20 307
#note not many highpointers left, that he can punish the x3 spot I'm opening.  Sim prefers ATOP, ATAP, or FADO there.
>Shannon_B: PT K9 T.P +10 226
>E_Tran: AFINOTU I10 .FT +6 313
#note Considered just taking the points with A1 FAUN, but c'mon.  Blocking bingos is more frustrating, and probably better for spread.

>E_Tran: ?AAINOU M9 A.AIN +14 327
#note I end up going over on time, just to be safe that he doesn't have any miracle bingos if I play UNAI at H12.  But then I decide to play it even safer.
