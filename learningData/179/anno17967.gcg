#note Likely setting up a T, right?
>Paul_S: ABIT E5 BAIT +22 40
>E_Tran: BDEFGIZ 10C GIBED +23 35
#note BZ and FZ seem like they both have ok synergy.  Since Paul has the lead in the bingo race, I liked closing the board.

>E_Tran: AAEFOPZ D4 ZAP +36 71
#note Missed F2 ZOEA.  
>Paul_S: KLNPU D9 L.NKUP +24 79
#note So much with my theory that he's close to bingoing.
>E_Tran: ADEFLOR 13B FO.LARDE +78 149
#note I hold LINKUP, then accept with a look of pleasure as I promptly lay this down.  I thought it might've been bad, but worth a try.
>Paul_S: FI H13 .IF +21 100
>E_Tran: ALMTTUW 14A TAM. +30 179
#note 0r 14D PAW.  I was too concerned with blocking the x3 lane.

#note Nothing better.
>Paul_S: AX 15A AX +46 160
>E_Tran: EELOQRW J11 Q. +11 208
#note EELORW draws into some good bingoes, especially FLOWERED/ER/ET.  I also didn't envision at the time that it would give cheapie pts to an I.
>Paul_S: IRU K9 URI. +34 194
#note Like that
>E_Tran: EELMORW M7 EELWORM +85 293
#note Scored as 75
>Paul_S: DHR 8L H.RD +36 230
>E_Tran: INNOOOS E10 .OI.S +33 326
#note Tough spot.  Pool is fecund, and I have no good blocks.  If I make a 5 pt block of DINO or NODI, he might still hit the F and I'd be in bigger trouble.  BOILS does jump to the top, but ONOS 14J or N12 SOON are decent compromises.

>E_Tran: GGNORST B6 GROG +14 356
#note Sim is liking T(UN)G to counterfish.  Even inferring AENT?, quack likes TUNG.  Best among bad options. GROG is a bad choice though, as GONG is clearly strongly.
>Paul_S: AW A7 AW +32 356
>E_Tran: JLNNSTU 14J JUTS +40 396
#note Wins 1/4 times, according to quack.  The best I can hope for.
>Paul_S: ?ACDEEO 10M .O +7 363
#note Miraculously, he has a rack that has no bingoes.  He does have a win though, in CORVEE!
