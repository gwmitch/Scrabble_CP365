>Chris: ADEEOOR -EOO +0 0
#note I was pretty tilted after scoring under 300 points for only the second time ever in a tournament game and I snap exchanged OOE here in 2 seconds and didn't think of ROADEO or any play really. Keeping DEER, ADER, DER, ADEER, and playing ROADEO all sim really close here. After the game Seth mentioned that ROADEO features in a Cesar meme lol
>Seth: AEGHOR 8C GHERAO +28 28
>Chris: ADEEEIR D8 .EADIER +22 22
#note Didn't know what to do here. I took the highest scoring option, but Q likes fishing with something like C7 AE or F6 AERIE. I kinda knew this wasn't best but I wanted to keep pace and go for the blanks I guess
>Seth: EINNRTT 13C R.NITENT +70 98
#note There were 2 places to play this for 70. I think I like E3 better since H12 is such a huge gimme spot to give up.
>Chris: BEFNRRY H12 F.EB +39 61
#note I thought keeping the Y with the NRR was worth not playing BEEFY for 42, but the sim disagrees by about 1%. I didn't know E4 FERNERY which keeps a healthier leave, but leaving H12 to him is something I'd rather not do anyway. FERN and REEFY look like decent options too.
>Seth: FLY 7G FLY +28 126
#note Extending the lead and threatening to fly away with the game :)
>Chris: AEJNRRY J10 JAN.Y +39 100
>Seth: ?AIKQTW -QKTW +0 126
#note Exchange 4
>Chris: ADERRVZ 11I R.ZED +30 130
#note I considered E5 RAZED for 33, which wins the sim pretty easily. I was concerned with getting crushed on a closed board after Seth plays at F6, but I think the score is close enough that it doesn't matter that much. I don't need to open the board unneccessarily like this right now and I think I'd play ADZ D10 given another chance at this position, or even something like AVERRED or RAVED on the E column to save the Z (more like my signature style)
>Seth: ALQU F10 QUA.L +36 162
>Chris: CEIRVWX L8 WIV.R +30 160
#note I chose WIVER L8 over REVIEW L10 because I liked CEX > CX more than 2 extra points, but I missed CERVIX L10 for 52!
>Seth: CEIKOO M3 COOKIE +31 193
#note Can I have one please?
>Chris: ACENSTX G7 ..X +21 181
#note Strongly considered VEX L10 to set up VEXT but was too scared of TTT?? in the bag. Somehow missed COAX L4, which is pretty inexcusable :(. FAX does sim 3rd after those 2 moves, but I think it's too fishy on a board that isn't super bingo-friendly, especially long-term if I don't hit it right away.
>Seth: ?ILMNST C1 SMeLTIN. +72 265
#note Seth didn't want to play this after my fish, scared of 3x3's, but the only other bingo he saw (I think) was SMaLTINE E1, which has the same problem. MINSTrEL E2 and STILlMEN E2 were the plays he was looking for and would have limited my response to just 60 points instead of what happened in the game hehe...
>Chris: ACDENST 1A DE.CANTS +176 357
#note It's better to be lucky than good. Suck it, COAX :P
>Seth: HO B6 HO +28 293
>Chris: AEIILNS A4 ELAIN +27 384
#note HO blocked LITANIES, which would've completed the ridic turnaround in this game. There's no way I'm fishing and leaving this lane open despite possible great leaves when I can score, block, and keep just over a bingo ahead with ELAIN instead. 
>Seth: EO 10L .OE +11 304
#note Opening more lanes in desperation. He didn't notice me foaming at the mouth as I stared at this before he hit the clock I guess hehe
>Chris: AEIPSVW O6 VIEWS +40 424
#note Not sure why I didn't play WAIVES or WAVIES.. it hardly matters though
>Seth: BO 2E BO +14 318
>Chris: AAOPSTU K4 PASTA +20 444
#note Horrible equity, but just wanted to block the remaining lanes and win the game. Didn't know SAPOTA or I'd have played it here instead.
>Seth: GRTU J2 GRUT +15 333
>Seth: GRTU --  -15 318
#note I've been there hehe
>Chris: OP L4 OP +23 467
#note Don't have my rack here. My tiles were so overpowered this game :|
>Seth: ADEGRTU 3E ARGUED +19 337
>Chris: ?GIIOUU 14J .OUnG +16 483
#note I guess I missed YOGInI here for 2 more
>Seth: MT H1 .T.M +9 346
#note Made a couple of really basic mistakes in the first half of the game, but I closed well after my super lucky break so meh
>Seth:  (IIU) +6 352
