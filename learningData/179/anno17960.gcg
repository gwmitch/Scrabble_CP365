#note 14K DANG/HANG are simming best.  I just hate giving easy pts to lower rated foes though.  I'd rather hang this T and give Siri a hard time hitting the x3.  Worth the minimal equity difference.

#note Thought this was likely good.  it's not.  I liked the turnover.  Siri has been making some fishing plays. but this doesn't exactly give him great letters to play through.

#note Main debate was between 13C WANE or 13D WEAN, and which one gave away fewer easy points.  Sim agrees that WEAN is better defensively.

>E_Tran: ?AAINQW 12B AWA +22 183
#note 12D AW gives away so many easy ponts, and sets up an easy bingo lines.  Even with a blank, I'm not ready to open the board until I rid of my Q.  Sim likes WA(Y) first, but AWA does jump into 2nd for win% and 1st for value.

#note A13 FRO is neat, to set up QUANT!  Otherwise, this is fine.  Maybe K4 INFO, but with the blank, I want to keep those lines open.

#note Good timing for me, as Siri blocks a lane while I score.

>E_Tran: ?AEFNOZ N1 FOZ. +38 271
#note I'm kinda scared of JIFF, JEFE, or FIFE.  Sim puts 15A EF and N2 FO(Y) ahead, expecting me to win a close games.  Giving him a shot at the above words for an easy cinch is a bad idea.  I was also low on time.
>Siri_T: EFI 1L FI.E +42 287
#note Crazy Siri story time.  After I make my play, Siri, with a full rack, absentmindedly reaches into the tilebag and withdraws two tiles.  Director is called.  Siri hasn't looked at the tiles yet.  What would you rule?  Randall has two suggestions: 1) Siri reveals the two tiles to me, puts them back in the bag, no penalty.  2)  Treat Siri as having overdrawn by 2, and I get to flip over 4 tiles and remove 2.  We go with option 2, I flip IUST, and I let him keep IU.

#note But Siri still has no win.  Having not tracked properly, I wait and wait, wondering if he can go out for the win
>E_Tran: EIOSS 15B SIS +20 367
#note Should make JOSS to block his best play.
