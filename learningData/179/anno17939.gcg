>James: EEIMORT 10E TIRE.OME +64 142
>Angela: ABNNRUY K10 .AYO +18 82
#note I think I like YAG J6 unless the rack was really bad. The 12 points are a big difference. 
>James: ENRUWWY 6E RUNW.Y +22 164
#note Quackle likes NEWER/EWER L9/L10, but I prefer balancing my rack more with RUNWAY. I also want to be more defensive than UNWARY at K1 (though that's 2 more points). 
>Angela: BINNRUX 13H COL.UR +18 100
>James: AEINOPW E5 P.ONA.E +36 200
#note At this point, I was happy to block the left to some extent. The W is useful for a -WN play off 8A as well, but at this point, Angela coming back will likely require using the open spots left, without much playback from me. 
>Angela: ABDINNX 8A GRAI. +21 121
>James: ADEIIOW 5K WADI +28 228
#note Missed OIDIA 12C. That would have been perfect in the context. WADI 12C would also make sense but I am thinking I was a bit nervous about PRONATED. 
>Angela: ADEGT 12A GATED +29 150
>James: ACDEIOX H13 .OX +36 264
#note OXID 13A is a great score but I did want to limit the possibility of big plays by Angela (the X gives a lot less bingos that start or end with it, than 20+ whatever for playing parallel to OXID. 
>Angela: BDIR B10 BR.ID +28 178
>James: AACDEFI 6L DEFI +36 300
#note Time to start trying to block up some of the lanes. Though this could also be very bad if Angela has a 3-3 as a comeback, it would likely require a bingo ending in SING, SIER, or SILY, and the first and third force the blank to be either a G or a Y. As such, the AAC leave looked fine by me. 
>Angela: EEFINSV O6 .MPI +24 202
>James: AABCILN 3L CAB +21 321
#note Most words are going to win according to Quackle, but I went for CAB to go for the best rack balance. Apparently, ABACI C6 is an almost guaranteed win. I'm not sure about that, since the 2-move swings for Angela would be an A1 bingo and a Q play at N10. (or an X bingo or bingo starting at N8 or N9 but both are hard to come by) It does make sense that something like ABACI or CABANA C3 would be worlds better than CAB, though, because they really limit the possible damage. 
>Angela: ?EEFLTU B1 FLUEnTE. +74 276
#note A phony, but I think this is the best move from Angela - a bingo that I'm not likely 100% on. From my perspective, the way I will lose is if I challenge, lose the challenge, and she goes on to bingo again. As such, I thought lead preservation was more important... 
>James: AIIKLNT 1A I. +15 336
#note But what to play in this situation? KA 2M scores well but it opens more lanes. I thought the F was the best chance Angela had of taking the game, so I played up top. 

Quackle favores other plays, though, like AIN or AIT C1. Those also make sense because they play off more tiles and make the F hard to bingo off of, but they also leave only 7 tiles in the bag. If Angela bingos again, I will know what she has and can plan accordingly. Most of the moves Quackle favors over IF play 3 tiles as a result. But it's also playing off the assumption that everything past this plays as the best. With the limited information both of us have after IF, and 9 in the bag, I like my position because I may have an edge in playing with the situation-specific intangibles compared to Angela. 
>Angela: ?QS O1 QiS +41 317
#note Oy. I am not sure about this play now that I think about it - SUQ 3A would leave the blank to Angela with two Ss in the bag. Trying to play a different move and threaten a Q pay at N10 would also be very scary from my perspective. This does help her to catch up further, though. 
>James: AEIKLNT 4A K.EL +26 362
#note Interesting. My play isn't seen favorably at all, but UNLIKE 3B and AKIN 4N are. I like AKIN (it kills the N9 bingo possibility, which is the most dangerous spot), and UNLIKE also leaves one in the bag so as to put a lot of pressure on Angela to bingo this time, but I didn't see a lot of possibilities. EXERTION didn't seem likely on Angela's side, and even if there was both Ss would have to be in the bag. Then again, there are also VORTEXES, VERNIXES, SIXTEENS, all of which wouldn't be S-friendly and threaten back. OVERSET is an almost guaranteed win. As such, I think AKIN is the move to make in this case, though the pair of Vs in the bag could also spell out a loss, which might happen to me if he plays EXERTION or the like (and then draw the Ss out the bag). 
>Angela: OV J2 VO. +23 340
>James: AEINSTT 14K STET +22 384
#note Almost any move wins. I just wanted to get rid of VERSO or the like. 
>Angela: EINORSV C7 R.VE +19 359
