>Sary: IIPT G6 TIPI +17 17
>Josh: EJLNOTU F7 JOLE +30 58
#note just JO seems bad, JOT looks alright though. This looks better than the others
>Sary: OUY E10 YOU +17 34
>Josh: AEEENTU 4H .UE +7 65
#note I found this was a difficult choice between exchanging and this. D10 ETNA wasn't something I saw, but it looks decent too. I decided U(K)E was unnecessarily risky.
>Sary: AERWX 13A WAXER +37 71
>Josh: AEELNST D4 LEANEST +72 137
#note that was lucky 
>Sary: ADET A11 TA.ED +30 101
>Josh: HILMRRT B10 HIL.R +40 177
#note Oh hey, a new word! THIR(A)M for 50.
>Sary: BE C8 BE +12 113
>Josh: BEHMRTU D12 M.TH +34 211
#note I wondered if THUMBER* were valid. I missed E5 HM which seems like a good alternative play. 12D H(U)B is also likeable here. I think my choice was probably correct.
>Sary: VW 6C V.W +9 122
>Josh: BCEGMRU 15C C.ERUB +39 250
#note Finally got to play this lovely word, and Sary knew it! Apparently it's a normal word.
>Sary: ??CENRS I7 SNiCkER +77 199
#note I1 CeR(U)mENS scores the most. She probably didn't know it. 14H aNCRESs seems good too.
>Josh: GIMOQYZ 13G GO.MY +13 263
#note I probably should have played something with SNICKERY since she would likely have challenged if she didn't know it. I saw 8A GY(BE) but I didn't want to give her another lane to work with. I wanted to block as much as I could here, this play seemed to accomplish that. I also thought this was a word, but it isn't. I should probably play GY(BE) anyway?
>Sary: AFGN 5J FANG +21 220
>Josh: AIIQSSZ N3 QIS +21 284
#note K10 SIZ(Y) is the alternative. I felt this blocked best but it's probably not a good idea to play it since it opens up ways for Sary to catch up without a bingo. Maybe just M3 ZI(G). I like the Z for more points though haha
>Sary: AF 6J FA +32 252
>Josh: AIORRSZ 10I .ZAR +35 319
>Sary: DIOV O1 VOID +46 298
#note yeah ouch
>Josh: DINOORS L3 RO.DO +19 338
#note what else is there to do? 
>Sary: AIT 11H I.AT +21 319
>Josh: DEILNSU I2 UL. +4 342
#note Was pretty sure this was a winning play too. I tracked correctly, saw nothing, was right. I can draw into a lot of stuff this way.
>Sary: AEGNOPT J1 OP +20 339
#note Her best play is 14K ATOP or 9K PENGO.
>Josh: ADEIINS M8 INSIDE +32 374

>Josh: A J13 .A +6 380
>Josh:  (AEGNT) +12 392
#note Wow, I played quite the solid game here. I'm really content with how I did, even though nothing fantastic happened. This was a pretty low-scoring game considering how well I played. I probably could have hit 400 if I played a tad more optimally though.
