#note WI(T)E is ahead, as is xxxxxER.  ER makes the most sense in hindsight.

#note Killer play

#note Must score pts.  ENDWI(S)E is neat to set up BENDWISE, but has too much downside.

#note Didn't spend enough time to find 6A MELODIA.  This is clearly better.

#note Spent at least 5 minutes looking for better bingos.  Should I make the 2nd blank an S or D?  I figured the S strengthens the x3 lane, to counter the F2 spot.  But, that's not necessary: OUTWARD is better defense.

#note True enough, I draw into the X-hotspot.  But instead I have to take this bingo.  It's close, but better, and might even draw a challenge

#note Tough rack.  I liked this because it neutralized the B10 spot.  Quack suggests I10 LUV, to set up a scoring spot for next turn.  4ply says its about 2 better.  I hadn't notice this set up a spot for AQU- words, which Michael would later fish for

#note The S is useful on this board, but gotta take the pts
