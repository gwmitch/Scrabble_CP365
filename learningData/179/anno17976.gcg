>Kevin_Bowerman: EIIMORR 8D MOIRE +20 20
#note maybe MIRIER?
>Matt_P._Hopkins: DIOU D4 ODIU. +16 16

>Matt_P._Hopkins: ADO 7G ODA +12 62
#note (L)OAD is 3 more
>Kevin_Bowerman: CILORRT H4 COL..R +12 80
#note (L)ICTOR. I was hoping he would open up an O for TRICOLOR. This is pretty far back from (L)ICTOR
>Matt_P._Hopkins: AEIMN 4H .INEMA +20 82
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEFIRTT B5 FATTIER +72 152
#note I wasn't 100% on this, but FETERITA is a really cool word that I did not know. Not sure what the best play here is.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: Q I3 Q. +21 103
>Kevin_Bowerman: AAINPRV A6 PIA +27 179
#note Probably AVIAN. I saw the word, but not the spot until after I hit the clock. I really wanted to block this spot for some reason tho. (O)VIPARA is a really cool word.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: AER G1 ARE +19 122
>Kevin_Bowerman: AELNRVV 1F ..V +18 197
#note I was really threatened by this opening, so I thought I needed to block. This isn't that bad, but I sould probably just play either V(A)V or V(A)LVAR. If I had seen V(A)LVAR, I probably would have played it.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: ADEIZ A11 AZIDE +77 199
#note Ouch.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AELNNRV M3 V.RNA +18 215
#note N(A)VAL looks a lot better.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: ??EEHLS C9 SHElLEd +79 278
#note (E)yEHoLES and (E)nwHEELS are sick! So is SHEqELs
>Kevin_Bowerman: ACELNRU L6 UNCLEAR +78 293
#note This scores best.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: EINS J2 NI.ES +20 298
>Kevin_Bowerman: GNOOTTT F8 .NGOT +10 303
#note I hated this position soooo much, because I can't do TONG or TOOT because they open too much, especially since he almost definitely has the S. I have no clue what to do here, but this doesn't look very good. Totally open to suggestions.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: GUU 12J GU.U +5 303
#note Is this just a fish, or is he trying to open an S lane? This limits plays from (NA) a lot
>Kevin_Bowerman: GJNOOTT M11 G.T +11 314
#note No clue at all what to do here. This is gunning for a huge J play (JUNTO or something at E11), which it seemed like I needed at the time.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: EIPY E11 YIPE +30 333
>Kevin_Bowerman: JNOOTTY K11 J.NTO +46 360
#note J(U)TTY is a lot better technically, but I did not see it. Everything loses here if he plays perfectly, so I have to pray that he messes up here.
>Matt_P._Hopkins: BDEESWX K1 DES.X +58 391
#note B(O)WSED is best, this loses every time! I got extremely lucky here!
>Kevin_Bowerman: OTY 15H TOY. +21 381
#note Got really lucky in this one.
>Kevin_Bowerman:  (BEW) +16 397
