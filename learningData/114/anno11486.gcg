#note Sim likes VAPID, which is pretty cool. It's strong defensively, and AGM is an interesting leave. If I draw an I, then an -ING bingo in line C becomes a good possibility.

#note VALUES 12A is an option, but this takes a 36-point lead and plays good defense, so I like it.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEIOQST 7B QA. +16 197
#note QIS 12D is 41 friggin' points. Burn your S, dummy.

#note Quackle much prefers HUN 13M, but I don't like it. At this score -- a decent lead, but still vulnerable to a bingo -- PLINTH controls the board the way I need. Turns out Jan had DEBRUISE ready to go down, and blocking it with PLINTH won me the game.

>Evans_Clinchy: AADGLNS 14B GLAD +20 267
#note Again overlooking the juicy score of the JITNEYS hook. Looks like GNAWS in that spot is the play.

#note Had enough time to study the pool closely and make sure zero outbingos were possible, so I just went for scoring and balancing. CP recommends OAK N6, though. Not a bad idea to save some spread by blocking the ZEK possibility.
>Jan_Dixon: EEIMRSZ 2J ZES. +33 297
#note Best
>Evans_Clinchy: AILNTU 4D LAT. +14 333
#note Wasn't 100 percent sure of LAITH, so I played it safe.
