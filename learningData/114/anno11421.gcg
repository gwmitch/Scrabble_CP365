>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEHLPRT 8H ALEPH +28 28
#note A bunch of stuff sims close here. PHT, TERAPH, and Ex. H all sim less than a point above ALEPH. All of them would have worked out better.

#note Sim isn't crazy about this. And I wasn't too pleased with it either. I considered burning the S with VANGS or CONGAS, but they both didn't seem quite worth it. Both sim a little better here.
>Adam_Logan: DIJNS J2 DJINS +27 155
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGNRSVY 4J .VY +18 138
#note I obviously hated weakening the ALEPHS spot, but I was sort of putting him on an S after DJINS. It's not necessarily the case, but it's a pretty likely scenario if he passed up J(OWE)D.
>Adam_Logan: LT 9H L.T. +8 163
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AABGNRS 3L BA +15 153
#note Now I'm certain he has an S and BAG seems way too risky.
>Adam_Logan: QSU M8 SUQ +24 187
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGINRRS 13G R.. +5 158
#note I am not crazy about my chances here, but what else can I do? I liked how this might bluff a T and encourage him to block the F column, when really the other bingo lines are my best chances.
