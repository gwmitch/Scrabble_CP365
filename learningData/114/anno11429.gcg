#note This play is the reason I posted this game: Quackle wants me to play qi at 12K, but I don't see how that wins. This lets me hedge my bets. If I hit an i I have qUi(z). If I hit an e I have qUe(e)r. If I hit a u I have both of them. He can only block/take one of the spots and has no way of knowing which one I will be able to use.
