#note Q prefers setting up the J with 7H BOOR or BRO, but the sim indicates this position comes down to stylistic preference more than  anything else.  I thought the J setup was too likely to be taken out with any number of counters like an H, W, etc.  Maybe BRO was the play, maybe not.  But this choice worked out very well for this game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DGO E8 G.OD +12 34
>Jim_Burlant: GJORRUY 12B JURY +38 56
#note Best - the next best play, JOG D10, wins almost 4-1/2% less often and sims nearly 10 points down on this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AHY 10C AH.Y +33 67
>Jim_Burlant: EGLOPRT B12 .OG +22 78
#note I debated between this and LOP 13A.  What swayed me: I didn't like the easy JO underlaps that would score huge, and I also saw potential bingos starting with the P at 7H, and this preserved it.  And if he didn't have an S, there really wasn't anything that horrendous given up at 15A unless he had AXW in his rack.  Quackle agrees with my reasoning - this is best.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CIIN 8A ICIN. +27 94
>Jim_Burlant: EELNPRT 13A L.PE +22 100
#note The only 8 in this set of letters is PETRONEL, and it doesn't play on this board.  This is best, and I'm 49% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HI 7C HI +20 114
>Jim_Burlant: AEENRTT 6B RATTEEN +70 170
#note Best bingo.  Other options include TERNATE and RATTEEN at 6D, 14D TERNATE, and 14D ENTRATE.  70% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AAFLNU 5F FAUNAL +27 141
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEEMN 6J MAE +23 193
#note Solid choice, but not best.   The best play here is admittedly very hard to see:  11D A(D)EEM scores 23 and does a better job balancing the rack.  This wins 67.5% to ADEEM's 69.5.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AO 14A A.O +11 152
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEENS 11E .EE +12 205
#note I saw 11E DEADENS and didn't like it - for 36 points I'd have  probably put it down but for only 26, I just thought it gave up all the ammo too cheaply.  Q initially doesn't like this, but after a few hundred 2-ply iterations, this percolates up towards the top.  While the sim gives the slightest of edges to DEADENS, in reality the difference between the two (DEADENS wins 80.2%, this wins 80.1) is so small as to be statistically insignificant.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BFO 4H FOB +31 183
>Jim_Burlant: ADDENSS 12G SADDENS +72 277
#note DESANDS scores 73.  Still 91.6% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: I I3 I.. +4 187
>Jim_Burlant: EGIPRTV 2I PRIVET +32 309
#note I wasn't concerned about rack building - I just wanted to empty as much of the bag as I could. Also - while plays like PAYER and PARVE score 37 to this play's 32, this turns 6 tiles instead of 4 (important with both blanks still unseen), and this took away the unobstructed run he had at row 2.   Now, if he doesn't have an S for a 7 down the O column, any 8 he puts down is going to have to give me something back.  Quackle says PARVE and PAVER H11 win roughly 0.1% more often than this.  I'd make this play again.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: KO K10 OK. +14 201
>Jim_Burlant: EGIMRSU J8 GUM +22 331
#note Q prefers 1M MUG.  Big lead or not,  I was sitting on the S and I saw the chance to play something at O1 or O2.  Hence, this choice.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ANZ H12 .ZAN +39 240
>Jim_Burlant: AEIILRS 11K .I +8 339
#note Q says I should forego fishing and play GIRLIE 8J.  I saw potential bingos on opposite ends of the board and was dead set in my mind that I was going to fish.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?CDLORW 14E COW.RDLy +69 309
#note Nice find!  The only bingo for Sam.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILRS N1 A.ELIERS +60 399
#note  The only bingo, which I autopiloted.  In retrospect, this position was not so cut-and-dried.  Quackle says I should play the bingo; the risk in doing that is that it's possible that, out of a very diminished pool, he's drawn a post-bingo rack of ENORST?.  In that case, Sam would bingo out with OESTRiN while I was sitting on VXW.  Problem with not bingoing is that any of the other options only score low to mid 20's (or lower if I opt to fish) and maybe I could lose that way depending on how end tiles fall out? What's right here?  Just roll the dice and gamble he doesn't have a playble bingo? Or should I have played it safe?  Thoughts anybody?
