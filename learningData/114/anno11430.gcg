#note I saw isobath and passed it up. quackle says play it. that way I draw 6 tiles I could bingo with instead of 4 (I am unlikely to bingo anyway with a leave like OSV).

#note I was being excessively defensive, hoping to block the S. With a decent leave here why not just play bevor?

#note I didn't want to give up LEACHIER, but I thought there was a decent chance that he would miss that and find charlie.
