#note quite silly not to play BAUXITE. i know it's horrible defensively, but i'm not going to score anything with BIU next turn. so why do i still make these mistakes? (-3.5)

#note i suddenly have less than like 10 valid plays. see why i should play bauxite? i considered exchanging obviously but BO seems to score enough. let's let him open up the board.

#note that's what you call an "i knew it was good, but i'm going to challenge because i'm mad" challenge. yes, i probably would have challenged even if it was RETAINS.
