#note gaby sims considerably better. I wanted to make sure I had an open board against doug though.

#note way too greedy, I have plays that are safer. mink makes sense

>JD: ABEITTV J6 VITAE +25 163
#note tough play, just trying to keep things tight while I have a bad leave.

#note what do you take this as? an X setup? two random letters?
>JD: DLNRRST 2F D.RN +9 245
#note maybe this is too conservative. rotl scores more and dirl sets up a nice lane. but his last play was suspect.
>Doug_Brockmeier: DEGLOV 12J G.OVED +29 237
>JD: ELORSTW O7 TROWE. +30 275
#note trowed is a pretty weak play. towels or low sim better. towels is a bit of a gamble. low leaves the optimal leave. trowed is too paranoid.

#note had to feel pretty good at this point....right?
>Doug_Brockmeier: DNOPRSU 1A SUNDROP +97 365
#note this is a fantastic play! it is exactly what he had to do to have any chance of winning. I should have had the guts to challenge. instead I failed to think clearly and let the time pressure I was in influence me.
>JD: CEEEUWX A13 WEE +25 372
#note given what he had drawn I also thought I still had a chance at winning if I could concoct an out-in-two. this is the second best option - the best loses by 1 point!! I can set up an unblockable huge X play at A6 with ECHE!!!! unfortunately the two plays he needs to play after that are the same ones he actually did play, so I guess I was sunk.
>Doug_Brockmeier: AEGI M12 .IG +14 379
#note nice play doug! this is his only win - if he plays ERA first I play VEX here and block VIG.
