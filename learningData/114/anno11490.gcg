#note I figured this was maybe a little better than M4 PAR, but I should not have done it just because I could not remember the hooks for it. I was pretty sure it wasn't the plural of anything, so does it take an S?

#note Turns out the only hook is -H, and I could have scored big points here. Missing PRUTAH, I also have N10 BHARAL.

#note I don't know what I was trying to accomplish taking this over FIZ. I guess I just didn't want to putter along with a rack of 1-pointers. I was feeling pretty snakebitten.

#note I have less than a minute and I have her mistracked. I panic. This doesn't block BEVOR and doesn't even guarantee an out. I slap this down with 4 seconds left.
