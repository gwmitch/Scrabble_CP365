>Matthew_Levine: ?AFGINR 8D FRAyING +78 78
>Matthew_Larocque: BGINORW I4 BROW.ING +69 69
#note Either placement sims the same.
>Matthew_Levine: OZ F6 ZO. +32 110
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEQSSS H1 ASEA +20 89
#note What an awkward situation. I had no idea if FRAYINGS was valid, but I'm almost always wrong when I guess those. G5 EAS(y) ranks about even with SEAS K5/K8. Meh, I'm not going to bingo with the Q so might as well try and milk the esses.
>Matthew_Levine: LOTU D8 .LOUT +16 126
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIQSST 11C Q.AI +26 115
#note I know typically I should be dumping my extra S. It's just that it makes it easy to score cheap points on subsequent turns. If I waste it here and don't draw a bingo then I'm probably going to make a bad fishing play.
>Matthew_Levine: ?GINPTU 2H .PoUTING +70 196
#note His highest scoring play is PIGNUTs K2.
>Matthew_Larocque: AALRSST C11 .AT +26 141
#note ASTRAL didn't sound like it would take an S. I also learned the anagram TARSALS. You can add a U to ASTRALS to make AUSTRALS too. Pretty bad time to suffer word knowledge failure - sim only gives this play a 23% chance to come back. But I guess it's probably higher because my opponent isn't going to play like Quackle.
>Matthew_Levine: ADEEOT O2 .OATEED +30 226
>Matthew_Larocque: AELORSS N8 OARLESS +71 212
#note I'm so horrible, I actually hesitated when I went to play this. It had to be the bingo though because....what else can you make with these letters? Oh, LASSOER and SEROSAL. Kind of odd that I don't remember SEROSAL. Like, at all. I probably would have thought LASSOER was a phony too. LASSOER for 89 is obviously a better shot at winning than this play.
>Matthew_Levine: MY M8 MY +26 252
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEEFMX J5 EX +52 264
#note Yay for flukes. N4 FEM performs well probably because of the F10 spot if I draw an I. Meh, I'm almost caught up after playing EX here. Don't need to gamble holding it off.
>Matthew_Levine: CRUV 12J CURV. +20 272
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEFJMY K4 FEY +37 301
#note All kinds of choices here, but FEY N4 sims a fair bit higher. I also forgot all about MYC and I would have played that instead of FEY had I saw it. 
>Matthew_Levine: IORU 3D OURI. +6 278
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIJLLM 4B CLIME +28 329
#note I might have been rushing here, JILL(S) or JELL(S) makes sense. Leaving esses wide open is pretty risky. Even IF I get a counterplay, there's no guarantee it'll be any good. CLIME ranks around #4. My chances to win are considerably higher now.
>Matthew_Levine: HO 10F HO +26 304
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEJKL M1 J.BED +30 359
#note I couldn't remember if JUKE took a D. J(I)BED is the clear sim favourite though.
>Matthew_Levine: AN G6 AN. +17 321
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIKLO B3 E.HOLIKE +71 430
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIKLO --  -71 359
#note I felt pretty good about HOELIKE, but it didn't play anywhere. This sounded a lot more plausible than HOELIKE so I quickly slapped it down. He challenged it pretty fast though, maybe he felt like he had too? Not the best timing for a phony, but like I said it seemed like it was probably a word. N5 OH and O13 HOE are among the best valid plays here.
>Matthew_Levine: DI O11 ID +21 342
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIKLO B2 HI.K +26 385
#note I knew this was subpar, but I kinda got lost, seemingly only focused on that one spot. Still N4 OH.
>Matthew_Levine: ADEENRT 1A ATE +23 365
#note I could have at least played HE(C)K so he didn't have this.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNOS 14A INSOLE +29 414
#note Can't play the bingo. Any of the sixes that fit here win 100%, INSOLE has the highest valuation. Because I, like, so totally knew it would. And I kinda forgot about ENSILE/EOSINE.
>Matthew_Levine: DENPRTW A12 WR.T +33 398
#note PEW(I)T makes the spread closer.
>Matthew_Larocque: EV F13 V.E +6 420
>Matthew_Larocque:  (DENP) +14 434
