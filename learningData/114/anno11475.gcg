>Matthew_Larocque: AAILSTU H8 UTA +6 6
#note Exchange AU is right up there too.
>Matthew_Levine: AHPP 10H .AH +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAILRS 11I AA +9 15
#note He probably doesn't have the other H, right? Looks like I need to study some 3 x A eights. There's 313 of them, and 18 that have 4 x A!
>Matthew_Levine: HPU K11 HUP +28 42
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNRS 12C RENAILS +69 84
>Matthew_Levine: CEI H12 .ICE +18 60
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEGITV 11B DEBIT +28 112
#note G(I)B? I don't really follow, DEITV is a super bingo-prone leave?
>Matthew_Levine: GIP 13A PIG +20 80
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIKORV 10D OKE +26 138
#note Taking the points again. Various dumping plays make up the other options, and (P)IG leaving EKOVR sims best. Do I really stand that good of a chance to draw something like EVOKERS? 
>Matthew_Levine: AILM L12 MAIL +26 106
>Matthew_Larocque: CGINRVX 8G C.RVING +14 152
#note This time I actually passed the seemingly obviously play of (P)IX for 36. I don't usually do something like this, but I guess my instincts were right - it sims almost as good. I kinda gambled that he wouldn't use the P next turn. With 6 new letters I'd assuredly have PIX POX or PAX if he left it alone.
>Matthew_Levine: EFT 15L .EFT +21 127
>Matthew_Larocque: BDNNOWX A13 .OX +36 188
#note Well, that almost ended up being really crappy. I missed the ERG hook for DOWN, which beats out (P)OX here.
>Matthew_Levine: ER 14L .RE +18 145
>Matthew_Larocque: BDINNRW 13K ..ID +27 215
#note I had to kind of cringe here, but with a board this awful, 27 points means a lot. And it's S-proof.
>Matthew_Levine: JN K7 J.N +10 155
>Matthew_Larocque: BLNNRSW 15F BL.W +9 224
#note I was kind of deadlocked between this or WR(E)N. Normally exchanging might be better, but it couldn't hurt my chances to eliminate any possibility of a bingo through the E. If he bingos on the top half at least I'll get something back.
>Matthew_Levine: QVWY -QVWY +0 155
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNNRS N2 MANNERS +86 310
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNNRS --  -86 224
#note Eh why not try this? I knew it was garbage, but maybe he'd leave it if he got something good. Or maybe I'm just ridiculous.
>Matthew_Levine: LO 14H .OL +12 167
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNNRS B13 .N +8 232
#note Hoping I draw A or I for MANAGERS or SMEARING. There's bingos to the R with O and U, but those are slightly less obvious and I probably would have thought they were phony lol.
>Matthew_Levine: Z F9 Z... +13 180
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNNRS -N +0 232
#note The classic draw-the-same-letter-you-just-fished-off dilemma. It happens almost everytime I fish. If I don't draw XYQZ instead. This is probably a stupid choice as I can still score points, like dumping the M at 12K. C10 is a cool spot I missed too for M(ERG)ER. G11 S(I)M scores 24.
>Matthew_Levine: ?DEIRTV B4 DIVeRTE. +72 252
#note Oh, that D was still there too. Lol.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMNRS M4 MENA.ERS +63 295
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMNRS --  -63 232
#note I gave this about a 10% chance of being valid. (V)ERSEMAN, on the other hand....
>Matthew_Levine: OUY A7 YOU +30 282
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMNRS C3 ME +11 243
#note DAMN I'M GOOD
>Matthew_Levine: OWY D2 YOW +36 318
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGNRS 6H GANDERS +75 318
#note In all honesty I had forgotten the possibility of DJIN until the moment I drew this rack.
>Matthew_Levine: O M5 O. +2 320
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOSTU 5D SOUTANE +81 399
#note Well, that was disgustingly lucky. After making a handful of asinine decisions this is my reward?
>Matthew_Levine: ?FIORST -  +0 320
#note He didn't know YOW was a verb.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEQ G3 QA. +22 421
#note Why Q(U)A?
>Matthew_Levine: ?FIORST 4J FORT +23 343
>Matthew_Larocque: EE 2C E.E +11 432
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?IS) +4 436
#note Yeah, that was silly.
