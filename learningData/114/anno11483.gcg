>Jim_Burlant: AAJSUVV K4 JAVAS +41 41
#note  I didn't like this, given both the UV leave and the easy comebacks if opponent had an O, but I felt 41 points were too many to turn down.   JUGA unloads the U, but it's still too easy for opponent to front-hook and I've still got both V's.  Q indicates that it's either this or JUGA. 
>q: EIOPTTW L3 POW +39 117
>Jim_Burlant: GMRSTUV 7C VUM +21 62
#note Best, but my winning chances haven't increased one iota.  Still 21% to win.
>q: EINOPTT H5 PET.TION +61 178
>Jim_Burlant: AEGORST B5 STORAGE +73 135
#note Board blindness.  Ever since I put down VUM, I fixated on taking that O hook away.  However, even ORGEATS or STORAGE on row 13 wasn't best; GASOMETER E3 scores 98.  Nice find, Quackle!  However, I benefit from this mistake.  Still not even 20% to win.
>q: BEEINOU M2 BEEN +36 214
>Jim_Burlant: AADINRS 13B RADIANS +79 214
#note I definitely blundered last time, but there was no screwing this one up.  This is the only playable bingo, and it wins 40%.  Back in the game.
>q: EIIORUX 14F XU +52 266
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCDEEO 15G BED +23 237
#note There are no bingos here.  Nothing really scores here and my best option score-wise is N1 BED 26.  I just didn't wanted Q to underlap AX and NU on row 15.
>q: EFHIIOR N1 FIE +25 291
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEOOOY A8 OY +26 263
#note I figured that there were too many points relative to the other chioces and that dupe O's weren't completely horrible; hence, this chioce.  The sim says it's either this or 10B GOOEY, and they sim interchangeably.
>q: ACHIORT E5 HO..RIC +56 347
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEOOY F5 OY +31 294
#note Solid chioce, but a slightly better play was available:  F2 COOEY.  I'd been struggling with racks and wanted to keep this together.  COOEY wins 29%, this wins not quite 26.  But this may have been the be3tter decision for this game.
>q: ADELTUW 11H .UTLAWED +74 421
#note Quackle doesn't know my rack, and it's winning 98% against a random rack.  But not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACENOT O8 OuT.ANCE +149 443
#note The only 3x3, and I'm now winning more than 50% for the first time this game.  The rest of the bingos don't even win 10%.
>q: AEEGILR O1 AGLEE +48 469
>Jim_Burlant: EFIKLNT A1 KNIFE +50 493
#note A little nervous about turning 5 tiles with QZ unseen, but since the duck doesn't seem to have a rack that can't score, I've gotta take the 50 and hope for a good draw.
>q: ILMORRS 12L MOR. +27 496
>Jim_Burlant: DILQRTZ 13K ZIT +41 534
#note Counterintuitive to let opponent Q-stick me, but this is the right call.  I considered Q dumps and realized that not only did I score 7 fewer points, but replaying the game after all was said and done shows that if I dump the Q, opponent plays IRIS 13J and I have to dump the Z for 34.  Insetad, I've taken away his best play and I win by roughly 10 more.

#note Just trying to milk tiles since opponent can't go out.
