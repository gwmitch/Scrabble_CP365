#note Surprisingly, this is the only double-double.
>JD: BEINOPR 7J B.O +14 40
#note it took me a long time to realize that this rack had fishing potential. just dropping the B sims well but rafi is likely to adjust his next play to take out the S. I like my play.
>Rafi: IILNRRT L11 TIRL +14 92
#note Not many logical fishes that left an S after BO, so I figured it was ok to go for the points/leave and block the best lanes for 8s. However, LIRI is safer and NRT is still a great leave.

#note Adding to the chaos
>JD: EEEFGLR 15D FLEER +42 156
#note I didn't think reflag was good. it sims pretty much even with this play. consonants seem good with lots of scoring spot available.

>JD: AEEEGIO H1 OGEE +21 177
#note just hoping he doesn't wreck me on column O!
>Rafi: ACEINST O7 CINEAST. +83 235
#note JD: I asked rafi if he was gonna triple-triple and he said "no, my play is more of a soft 7, hard 8". I love it.
>JD: AEIMOUX 13G MOXA +46 223
#note my first significant miss of the game, axiom is definitely better
>Rafi: ?DEMNTY 9B DYNaM.TE +73 308
>JD: EHIJLTU 2F JU. +27 250
#note I don't really want to close these lanes but no choice comes close.
>Rafi: ABDGKNU 8A KAB +37 345
#note GUNK is another good option, as it'll be hard to block the BOO hook with DUNG on my next turn.
>JD: EHILOST M1 HOLIEST +79 329
#note JD: intriguingly dropping HOS actually ends up with a higher win percentage, keeping him from taking the S hook himself. still I don't think EILT is worth passing up the bingo for. I would rather give myself a shot at drawing the case S.
R: Adding on to Jesse's thoughts, I could have played BAS for 54 if I had the S, so Jesse gets 7 draws at it while I only get 3. I think those odds tip the scale towards bingoing.
>Rafi: DDGNRUU 5B DRUDG. +18 363
#note Missed UNGUARD here, which is a significant win% loss according to quackle. Despite the Q, gotta ditch the U with VVWW unseen.
>JD: ACGUVWZ 1L C.UG +39 368
>Rafi: DEHINQU B2 QUI. +28 391
#note R: Case E and no I's left to block. The only block is with the S, which is unlikely with CINEASTES available.
JD: sharp play, guess he has the last E. uh oh.
>JD: APVVWWZ 4L W.Z +30 398
#note my chances are not good one way or the other, especially knowing that the E must be on his rack. however, I think ZIP here should be better than WIZ - in spite of duplicating the W, if I play for drawing the S and a vowel, then the second W will allow me to score more than the P will. I would also love to hold onto the Z for 10B but short of VAV at E8 I see no great alternatives that do that.
>Rafi: ADEHNOR N10 HAO +31 422
#note The EQUID hook isn't going to be blocked, so I can save it for next turn. RAH is best because of the chance of DEVON. Either way, I get FEND, PEND, VEND, or WEND with all the high-pointers so I'm pretty set no matter what I draw.
