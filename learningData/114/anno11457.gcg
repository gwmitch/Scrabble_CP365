#note This is the silver medalist, but that's very deceving.  I'm a yutz because the best play is, appropriately enough, YUTZ F7.  I missed it yet again.

#note Well, I finally get one right.  27% to win.
>Chris_Cree: MU D12 MU +22 154
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDELNN 14B BEND +19 124
#note Thought there might be something through the E but couldn't find anything FROM the E.  (E)NNoBLED 15H scores 89.  AS for the non-bingos, Q says I should have played BLEND for the extra 2 points.  What does it know about my next rack that I don't?
>Chris_Cree: DEGIU H2 GUIDE +13 167
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALLNSS 10G .NStALLS +59 183
#note Interesting - bingoing is not best according to the duck.  I did see INStALLS on row 4 but thought it was too dangerous to slot the triple for only 64 (I kept misscoring INSTALLS on row 4 as 64, not 66) and given the ebb and flow of the game, I felt like it would be a situation where going for 5 extra points could lose me the game.  Best is E3 LAS for 30.
>Chris_Cree: AEHORTT N6 RHEO.TAT +63 230
#note The only bingo for Chris, and it wins 65%.
>Jim_Burlant: AEJOORV 8L JE.R +57 240
#note Prior to his putting down RHEOSTAT, I was expecting to play JO 15A to leave myself AEORV and hopefully hit an OVER word of some sort on the next turn.  Once his bingo came down, I had to change my tack.  This is a no-brainer play, but the unbalanced leave started causing me all sorts of problems from this point forward - there were plays available but I just couldn't manage the tiles or board vision effectively enough.  
>Chris_Cree: ADTU O12 DAUT +28 258
>Jim_Burlant: AACOOQV 3F AQ.A +24 264
#note Q says there are 4 plays that stand out, and this is one of them.  The others are B10 VOCAB and J8 OCTAVO.  I didn't know OCTAVO and I was blinded by the presence of the Q - I felt I had to unload it now, because if he did something on rows 2 - 4, I might not have a play.
>Chris_Cree: EF J2 FE +27 285
>Jim_Burlant: BCEFOOV J6 COVE. +15 279
#note The question I was asking myself:  on this board, should FE have been interpreted as being a fish?  Or should was it his only means of scoring?   I felt that, with me sitting on this clunk and his having played off an E, he was probably close to something.  This choice was a deliberate attempt to kill bingos down the J column and keep the game close.  Against his rack of ACEIOPR (Chris told me post-mortem that he had OPERATIC ready to go through the blank T), BOOT 11K does the same thing and it scores 9 more points.  However, it's still not looking good - BOOT wins 33%, this wins 27.
>Chris_Cree: ACEIOPR L8 .A.OP +28 313
>Jim_Burlant: ABFINNO 2E IF +26 305
#note The strain of all the hard racks was beginning to show - the play here was FANION 15A.  I saw FANION in my rack but missed the MUN back-hook.  FANION wins 42%; this wins 18.
>Chris_Cree: CEIR 4J RICE +18 331
>Jim_Burlant: ABLNNOW K10 .WOL +28 333
#note I seriously considered 2J FLOWN as an attempt to set up my B, but the unseen M scared me away from it.  I didn't like the unbalanced leave with dupe N's, but I thought that with all the I's in the pool, it was still workable.  Also - the game was close enough that I was feeling the pressure to stay in it, and the 4 extra points for this choice swayed me.   The simple 15A WON is the sim winner, and FLOWN is a respectable second.  WON certainly would have prevented his next play.  WON wins 29%; this wins a hair over 21.   
>Chris_Cree: AEIIRR 15A AIRIER +37 368
#note What does he do with this if I find FANION a couple of turns ago or play WON on the previous turn?
>Jim_Burlant: ABINNPS 1A PAINS +26 359
#note At this point, I have no win.  If I had paid attention to the pool (I'd given up on the game by this point) I'd have played NEB or BEN M3 to set up a PAINS 1A OUT.  He said he'd have played TAMALE O1 with the blank, and I'd have lost by roughly 30.  Instead, I gave him a present.  Very sloppily played on my end.
