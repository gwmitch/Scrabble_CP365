#note No place for PRETELL.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AEIU 7D AU.EI +18 131
>Toh_Weibin: DEERTTU 9C TED +15 82
#note TUT 6B is a much better move here, and missing this probably cost me the game. I could have found it with more careful thinking on my part.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AENO 9H AEON +14 145
>Toh_Weibin: DERRTUV 10J DUVET +26 108
#note Stronger than DERV, for a variety of reasons.

>Toh_Weibin: ?AGIRRV 9M VI. +29 180
#note The recommendation here is A2 RIV(EL). Is it too open? I guess I can't dispute Quackle's view, considering how far I am behind and how closed the board is.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AHIMNSU 12E HUMANIS. +70 329
>Toh_Weibin: ?AAGIRR 13A ARRIAGe +75 255
#note AGRIA 11A, then ARRIAGe 11A slightly preferred (by about 1.2% and 0.5% respectively). I wanted to give myself a variety of ways to catch up - bingo from the B line or line 14, or something like Z(A)NY.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: CNY A12 C.NY +36 365
>Toh_Weibin: AEEGINO 10B OE +6 261
#note My play doesn't appear on Championship Player simulations but it looks like a strong play to me - another option is 3N or 4N OE but that didn't seem threatening enough. (R)EO or (R)OE, or other less offensive dumps aren't volatile enough against a human player. OE N6 is also possible, but C(A)NY suggested a consonant heavy rack and I was hoping that Jianrong had no play to the triple.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: IKNWY 14G WINKY +32 397
>Yong_Jian_Rong: IKNWY --  -32 365
>Toh_Weibin: AEGGINP 11D GAP +30 291
>Yong_Jian_Rong: IKNWY 14G WINK +28 393
>Toh_Weibin: EGIILNO 7N E. +3 294
#note What I saw: Possibility of drawing C, M, R, S, T, all of which would give me a decent scoring bingo. Benefit of slowing the game down to give me more turns to catch up.

What I didn't realise: Y on Jian Rong's rack gives him a decent chance of playing something /KY at the triple, so a 1 tile fish for TOILING or SOILING is not very useful.

E(D), the 3rd-8th best play, loses 0.8-1% winning chance on simulation, which can be significant at this stage. There are two plays here which stand out - one of which is probably rather weak against a human player. The viewers can figure this one out.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: OTY 15H TOY +35 428
>Toh_Weibin: GIILNOZ A8 ZIG +43 337
#note Very varied results again here - but it is virtually impossible for me to catch up now. ZIG is decent, and I have to hope for some big mistakes on Jian Rong's part.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: INQ M5 QIN +18 446
>Toh_Weibin: HILNOOR 6L L. +2 339
#note With QIN, I have lost the game, and now fish for a desperate HORNITO. Opening up something like O(F) 4N could result in something like RETIMES, even if I picked the C for CHLORIN. Obviously, playing to the P is better here, but once again I hope for an error...
>Yong_Jian_Rong: CI 2B CI.. +12 458
>Yong_Jian_Rong: EEMRST (challenge) +5 463
#note So I give him the nickel, because it doesn't matter at this point.
>Toh_Weibin: HINOORT B6 RHO +19 358
#note Many better plays here..
>Yong_Jian_Rong: EEMRST N1 METE +17 480
