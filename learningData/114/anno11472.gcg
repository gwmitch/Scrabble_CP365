#note this was an important game, so I took my time looking for other options but this is the only bingo.
>Kenji: JO 7C JO +22 50
>JD: ABGLRST E7 B.G +18 82
#note not a bad option (I looked for something like ratbag and couldn't find it, ratbag is a slight upgrade) EXCEPT THAT I MISSED A BINGO THAT ALMOST GUARANTEES ME THE GAME! batgirls is a huge miss! I know the word and looked at the I but just failed to come up with it.

#note at least I finally did get down a 3x3 - kenji held for about 4 minutes because he was thinking of the wrong anamonic for SOAPIER.

#note plays at row 8 are asking for trouble on a rather closed board. orgone wins the sim by a lot and other plays from the R sim well, but after orgone kenji can just fork the board elsewhere and the board will never be closed again. maybe it's worth trying to outrun him anyway. not sure.
>Kenji: ADIRY L11 DAIRY +29 188
>JD: AAINOSX M5 ANOXIAS +70 314
#note I think this play is a little more defensive in the long run than ANOXIA at the top-left, but the sim shows no signs of agreeing. I am a heavy favorite one way or the other.
>Kenji: AIKO 14J KO.AI +38 226
>JD: BEHLNTV G5 HEB. +25 339
#note I was at a loss for a play and starting to run out of time in a hurry. I saw EVEN which significantly drops his bingo percentage but stupidly didn't pull the trigger. BEVEL at L1 accomplishes the same thng.
>Kenji: CDIRSUY -CDIRSU +0 226
#note his actual rack...crazy-ji decided that he wasn't going to win and that he should go for the yo prize instead. really no play has a great winning percentage anyway.
>JD: HLMNTUV B11 VU.H +22 361
#note just taking the points for HIM is fine too
>Kenji: ?ADEELY J7 Yo +10 236
#note yep, this actually happened.
>JD: ILMNRTW 15H TWIN. +41 402
#note I stopped writing my racks down because the game was crazy. I think my last one was an R.
>Kenji: ACEELNR N1 CLEANER +80 316
>JD: ALMORRS O7 ARM +18 420
#note pretty unnecessary, might as well play armor and end the game.

#note he should block my out.

#note and that was the anti-climactic end of the tournament for me, as I got a bye for the last round.
