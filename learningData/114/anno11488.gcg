>Matthew_Larocque: ABDIJNN 7H BAN +16 16
#note A little bit dangerous but everything simulates pretty close here - JNAN(A) is the slight favourite. This gives me a possible DJIN play next turn.
>Matthew_Levine: ANT 6G TAN +14 32
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIJNP K5 DJIN +30 46
>Matthew_Levine: DU 5K .UD +5 37
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEGPR N3 PREAGEd +67 113
#note I looked for other words since I was a little shaky on this word's validity, but I started to waste too much time. PuGAREE, PeERAGE, PREGamE, PREsAGE are among the other words here. This is the worst simming bingo. :/
>Matthew_Levine: DOW O8 DOW +31 68
>Matthew_Larocque: EFLOSVZ 3K FLO. +18 131
#note Wasted more time here - there had to be a better play? I don't know - it does well in the sim though. Maybe VOLES 11K as a defensive measure.
>Matthew_Levine: COS O1 COS +25 93
>Matthew_Larocque: EGOSTVZ 2J VOE +21 152
#note Still making me cringe, but nothing sims better.
>Matthew_Levine: GI G8 .IG +8 101
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINSTZ 11E ZESTING +126 278
#note This actually happened. Utterly absurd.
>Matthew_Levine: DRSU H11 .URDS +21 122
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINTUY 12C YUAN +27 305
#note Well, I actually did see UNITArY. Stupid blanks always disguising hooks! U(R)bANITY plays through the R, but I didn't know that one.
>Matthew_Levine: ABP 13B BAP +28 150
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AHIMTT 14A TAM +26 331
#note Sim still likes HIM better here. In retrospect BI makes it a lot less likely he will score instead of BA.
>Matthew_Levine: EX 14H .EX +27 177
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEEHIT 5E HIE +14 345
#note bHEE(S)TIE. Totally unforgivable to not know that! But I somewhat redeem myself with an easier play.
>Matthew_Levine: RTU 4D RUT +13 190
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEHIMT 15F ME.HIEsT +76 421
#note Truthfully I wasn't 100% on this....
>Matthew_Levine: ILL -  +0 190
#note Good thing it was a good guess.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFILRY K13 EY. +21 442
#note F(R)Y scores 30 but might leave me really vowel heavy.
>Matthew_Levine: ILL M12 LIL. +8 198
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFILR 13G A.F +24 466
>Matthew_Levine: OR 15A OR +17 215
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIILOR E8 COL.. +16 482
#note Dunno - just finishing the game at this point....
>Matthew_Levine: EEK 3B EKE +16 231
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINOR 8A IONI. +24 506
>Matthew_Levine: IOQRST N11 QI +13 244
#note Hmm, he missed playing it at the ZESTING spot?
>Matthew_Larocque: AER O12 ERA +8 514
#note EAR 10J.
