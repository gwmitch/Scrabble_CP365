#note this is an interesting choice. I figured he would kill me on column C this turn but this was the best he could do.

#note his rack here was congius...he's in trouble because he can't play at C1, but CUP at E3 might be the best shot he has - blocking easy plays on column C and creating a new lane.

#note as far as I can tell, the ways I could lose this game are for him to bingo through the P or to the E. It's hard to see him outrunning me as long as I score enough. quackle suggests ANY at D7 to take out some of those bingoes (his bingo percentage drops from 12 to 6%).
