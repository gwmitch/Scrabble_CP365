#note I just got into this mode this tournament where I just make shitty challenges. This is a really pathetic challenge, as I can basically tie the game if I don't challenge.

#note I know this is phoney, but I need to lose by less than 50 to get 1st or 2nd.

>Jackson_Smylie: ADGMNOZ J11 G.NZO +35 166
#note A very plainly pathetic play. I don't care if he bingo bango-ed at the beginning, I deserved to lose this game. I find the tenth best play. I just didn't look at enough of the board. I didn't think of plays down the O column, I didn't see the G9 spot, I just feel my board vision slipped. Damn. G(I)NZO is 12.7 down from 08 AMONG, the top play.

#note FML. I lay down GUR and the OG, then take it off thinking GU(A)RdDOG is two words. I hate seeing things and balking on them. This game is just a bile heap of shit. I even miss a nice sandwich, G7 DRUG.

#note And with that I crown myself the failing champion of 2012. Yes, ORIGINS DOES have 2 anagrams. Pathetic.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?ST 6H .eTS +15 321
#note (FE)iST. This is just a pathetic game. I made a couple of mistakes against Vera Bigall and Yvonne Lobo, and then some wrong challenges and phoneys this tournament, but I felt I played well in the first 5 games. This game is just a travesty of scrabble playing. I was trying to time rush him at the end, which explains my horrible playing, but certainly doesn't excuse it. Hopefully I can remain focused with a head on my shoulders at next weekend's 12 gamer.
