#note HALM or ARGH maybe better in that spot

>James: EGILOSZ 10D LEZ +73 241
#note ugh. should have played 10F ZO keeping LIGES.
>Tony: BDEIIOS 3G BIO.IDES +84 233
#note was 99% sure it was fine, but the challenge is only 5 points.   I forgot to add this 5 to Tony's score in quackle (this is important at the end).

#note Missed 3 better plays.  13h SPON(G)INS, 13e SPONSIN(G), 12a PONS.
>Tony: AEIRTW N8 TAW.IER +36 358
>James: ?EGOPSS O7 POSE +31 345
#note this is getting ugly.   Missed SPONGES & GOSPELS.  The former plays at 4b/5a and both hook HOMING-S.  I wasn't 100% on this hook.
>Tony: AEFL O12 FLEA +46 404
>James: ?CGGSUY H8 ..GGY +14 359
#note sims close to top play C11 (E)GGY.   I thought HOMING may take the back S and so played this and kept the S with that in mind.
>Tony: APT 5E TAP +17 421
>James: ?CDDISU H1 DU. +12 371
#note Lucky i didn't spot the bingos beause I'm almost certain to lose if I play them (CUDDIES / CUDDINS).  Quackle's top play according to champ is 4d CUD.   My play does very well too - I liked leaving 2 in the bag and perhaps forcing Tony to leave one in the bag, giving me potentially two draws for a bingo. - as well as creating a lane to the D.
>Tony: O 1H .O +3 424
>James: ?CDIOSW A11 COWeD +44 415
#note If anyone can work this out........ F4 W(AD) wins 82%,  B7 (FA)W wins 19%.   I got lucky with my play.
>Tony: AEERTUY 4C TREY +23 447
>James: IQS 14J QIS +45 460
>James:  (challenge) +5 465
#note QIS at 3A for 28 does not actually win as I challenged BIOCIDES, so it would lose by 3.   At this point, I had to hope my hunch about HOMINGS was right - which it was fortunately.
