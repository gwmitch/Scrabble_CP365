#note If Zev doesn't have an I or a bingo, he's pretty screwed. And luckily I have an I and I am close to a bingo.
>Zev_Kaufman: INNOU 10G UNION +20 30
>Jackson_Smylie: EILNOTT K5 TONTI.E +28 51
#note This is where I go and review my top 4000 8s.
>Zev_Kaufman: PSU 11G PUS +25 55
>Jackson_Smylie: ELMRTWY 8K .WYER +45 96
>Zev_Kaufman: FGRU J3 FRUG +21 76
>Jackson_Smylie: ALMORTT 12D TAROT +21 117
#note I sat here for a really long time and just didn't see a thing. I wanted to keep a half-decent 2 or 3 tile leave, but still score to stay ahead. I assumed I missed something big, but TAROT is actually near/on the top. (F)ORMAT is best says speedy, but it opens the tws and other options. I don't like (N)OM, as ALRTT can really really suck. LM gives me scoring options and a bunch of chances to draw fresh tiles.
>Zev_Kaufman: DILU 3J .LUID +18 94
>Jackson_Smylie: BGHILMN E10 BL.H +18 135
#note Another turn where I just didn't see anything. The top 6 choices are all within 2.5 points. I don't know if there is a clear best play, as all have their pluses and minuses. I didn't know BIM(A)H, and GLIB is possibly right. GIMN isn't amazing, but I like it a lot, more than HMN kept with GLIB. There area few lines open, but that doesn't change a whole lot. By playing 5 iles with GIMB(A)L, I can try to draw and S or blank, and the S will take the FLUIDS hook.
>Zev_Kaufman: ?AADFIS O6 FA.ADISe +62 156
#note FA(R)ADISm is the most defensive of the three bingos. FA(R)ADISe takes 2 hooks, whereas SAFA(R)IeD gives back a lot on the N column. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AGIMNSX N10 AXING +47 182
#note Regardless of the bingo he plays (as long as it's AADEIFRS), I have a big X comeback.
>Zev_Kaufman: ELORV L11 LOVER +20 176
#note LO(U)VER is cool.
>Jackson_Smylie: CEKMSVW M2 V.EW +10 192
#note I wasn't sure how to play this turn; CWMS pluralizing BLAH is best, but I wasn't 100% sure on BLAHS. V(U)M is scary because of the O hook, but I may be being paranoid. CKMS blends well, and with some vowels I can score a bunch on the O column. V(I)EW sims third best, behind CWMS and V(U)M.. I suppose W(I)VE is fine too, setting up a second S hook, which is tasty. V(U)M may be volatile, but CEKSW can score a lot to the R on the 15 row. 
>Zev_Kaufman: ABER M12 BARE +36 212
#note Eek.
>Jackson_Smylie: ACHKMNS 4L H. +20 212
#note This is where I lose the game. I just COMPLETELY whiff the FLUIDS hook as soon as my turn starts. It is just pathetic. I took a while on this turn, and just saw nothing. God. I don't know how my board vision just temporarily shut down. Game losing play = H(E). There is also CHASM 14B is I don't see FLUIDS, but as I said before, I wasn't sure of BLAHS, and I didn't see chasm ;).
>Zev_Kaufman: EI 2M .IE +18 230
>Jackson_Smylie: ACEKMNS 1N KA +32 244
#note Of course now I see MASK. Right as this turn starts. I can play SMACKE(R) for 40, but I'm not sure how I feel about somewhat opening things up at this point - a 14 point lead and CEMNS is surely going to serve me well.
>Zev_Kaufman: OO 13C OO. +14 244
>Jackson_Smylie: CEEIMNS 15G SINCE.. +27 271
#note I wasn't sure how to play this turn, I don't envision a bingo coming down soon from my end. Again, 14 row was missed. MENSE and CENSE are both very good in that spot. MESIC 14C is nice as well. SINCE(RE) doesn't allow many points to be scored by Zev.
>Zev_Kaufman: IQ 14F QI +33 277
>Jackson_Smylie: ACEJMMR 10B JAM. +31 302
#note CRAMME(R) blocks bingos to the R, but I feel Zev bingos as much if not more often through the C and R.
>Zev_Kaufman: ?ADELSY 4C DiALYSE. +74 351
>Jackson_Smylie: CEEGMNR H1 GEM. +21 323
>Zev_Kaufman: ADEEOT 5C ODEA +21 372
>Jackson_Smylie: CENR C7 REC.N +11 334
>Jackson_Smylie: CENR --  -11 323
#note Not sure why I played this, didn't care too much about spread, meh.
>Zev_Kaufman: ET B10 .ET +10 382
#note A quite bad performance on my part, what with TONTI(N)E, H(E), V(I)EW, and missing BLAHS umpteen times.
>Zev_Kaufman:  (CENR) +12 394
