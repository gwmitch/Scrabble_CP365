#note Saving the U, and I figured Mike may not know WEXE.
>Mike_Frentz: HU 13B UH +28 250
#note Maybe he missed the U hook?
>dacrON: CDILUUV 2B CU.ID +28 242
#note An incredibly frustrating rack. Maybe I should leave the hook alone. In which cas K9 SCUDI is the play...not so sure. LUV using the hook wins the sim...

#note 4F D(U)TIFUL evaded me.

>dacrON: ENOTTTV M2 TOT +18 280
#note DOVEN/DEVON seemed too risky, but (D)EVOT# would've been nice, if I knew it. NOTT#, which I didn't know, is also an improvement.

#note So desparate to get a freakin' +5 (which I did get) that I missed freaking QI(N).
>Mike_Frentz: EEELNOP 1N PE +16 354
>dacrON: FGIJOTY M8 .OTIFY +26 368
#note Apparently I overanalyzed this play completely. I figured this forced him to bingo with HEHS, and I could get a Z comebacker a lot. The pool seemed pretty nice, especially after he played PE. It's tough to make a decision on how likely somebody is to bingo in a situation like this - apparently I chose very wrongly. As it turned out, he had jack.
>Mike_Frentz: BEELNRS 1H REB +19 373
#note Quackle doesn't like this play much either...
>dacrON: ACEGJRR 13I JERR. +23 391
#note I was at 1:00 here. I was so concentrated on whether or not JAGIR# was good, that I missed REJ(I)G, which wins a whopping 75% of the time. As it turned out, the A in the bag would've lost either way.
