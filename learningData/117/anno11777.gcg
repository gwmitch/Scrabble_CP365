>Sue_Tremblay: GHORTXZ 2F ZO. +32 32
>Ross_Brown: BCIIOQS 9F QIS +25 103
#note 6F SQ(U)IB +24 is nice, but I'm thinking defensively.
>Sue_Tremblay: GHIROTX G2 .HO +25 57
>Ross_Brown: BCIJLOR F4 COB +20 123
#note 6D BIJO(U) +30 is much better.

>Ross_Brown: AAEEEGL C9 EAGLE +17 204
#note Best.
>Sue_Tremblay: CEIRSTT B3 TRISECT +64 180
#note 14C TRISECT +68 is worth more, but risky.
>Ross_Brown: AEENRRS 12C .EARNERS +68 272
>Sue_Tremblay: AINOOUW -IOOUW 0 180
>Ross_Brown: ?ADEFNY 14A FEDAYiN +84 356
#note I know FEDAYEEN is good, and I've seen it spelled this way in print, but this is not a valid English spelling.  It is valid in ODS5 (French).
>Sue_Tremblay: AEENOWY J8 YOWE. +34 214
#note Missed 15D WANEY +62.  Even 15F NOWAY would be advisable as a block.
>Ross_Brown: EELNOOT 15E ENOL +20 376
>Sue_Tremblay: ABDEHIN 15A AH +35 249
#note Best.
>Ross_Brown: EFLOPRT K9 FOR +26 402
#note For some reason I think this spot is hot, though the big tiles are gone.  J4 FOP +27 is better in all respects.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?BDEINW L10 WEB +28 277
>Ross_Brown: AELPTTV A1 PLEAT +31 433
#note This is actually the most dangerous bingo line; PLEATED would have fit for 95.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?IIIDNN M12 IN +8 285
#note Quackle advises an exchange, but the unseen tile pool isn't inspiring.
>Ross_Brown: EGKTUUV N10 VUG +21 454
#note Best.

>Ross_Brown: IRTU A12 TU.. +8 503
#note This (like the other 8-point play, 3A (ET)UI) is vulnerable to a stick, but Sue's clearly not in the mood for that.
