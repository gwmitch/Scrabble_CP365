>Gunther: ABFNNOS 8G FANON +16 16
#note I sacrifice 8 pts here to prevent some possible comeback plays. Not worth it, however. 8D placement is recommended.
>Peter_Huszagh: DII K8 .IDI +10 10
>Gunther: ABEKLST 11G BALK.EST +64 80
#note Ugh. Not a good night for me. BLA(N)KETS I5 scores 6 more. GEEZ.
>Peter_Huszagh: AEHVY 12C HEAVY +35 45
>Gunther: EEEFOWW 9G EWE +22 102
>Peter_Huszagh: IP 13B PI +18 63
#note Peter thought long here. I figured he was close to bingoing.
>Gunther: EFOOPRW E7 FOREP.W +30 132
#note Quackle likes POW 7H here. I considered it, but I wanted to disrupt row 14.
>Peter_Huszagh: GIT 14A GIT +22 85
>Gunther: ?ACELOT D3 TALCOsE +74 206
#note Bingos from D1 score highest (77). ChOLATE, COlLATE, CALOTtE etc. My play, to my surprise, drew an instant challenge.
>Peter_Huszagh: AIIRSTU -  +0 85
>Gunther: DIIMNOO 12L MOOD +30 236
#note An open N for DOMINIO(N) would've been nice, or open H for (H)OMINOID. Oh well. Quackle likes IMIDO E1. MOOD is second.
>Peter_Huszagh: AAT O12 .ATA +15 100
>Gunther: BEEIINN C2 BINE +20 256
#note NEB 13K.
>Peter_Huszagh: LUX 13K LUX +45 145
>Gunther: AACEINN 7H CAN +20 276
#note Avoiding better scoring plays at B2 because I know he's close to something.
>Peter_Huszagh: RU 2A RU. +10 155
>Gunther: AEEINOV 6J OVINE +17 293
#note Interesting situation. With 3 esses unseen, OVINE takes a stab at drawing one. If he hits column O, I have a shot at column A as well as row 15 if I should pull an S. Worst case scenario: he 3x3's without an S, then pulls an S to have future shots on both column O and row 15. This scenario isn't as unlikely as I thought in the game, but I was feeling aggressive. Quackle likes OE 15A.
>Peter_Huszagh: AIORSST 15A OAST +36 191
#note Peter spent over five minutes on this play and missed some bingos. AORISTS, SATORIS, ARISTOS and ARSO(N)IST. I almost challenged OAST ( a word I've NEVER seen) (I guess its an oven or something). If I challenge I get roasted in an oast.
>Gunther: ADEEILU A1 U.EDIAL +30 323
#note Takin' this spot OUT.
>Peter_Huszagh: IQ 5L QI +24 215
#note QI 14J is stronger, but maybe he wants to preserve row 14?
>Gunther: ?EGHIRU O4 GUsHIER +94 417
#note Also GRUsHIE, but this scores more, and draws a challenge. There's another bingo on the board, and it's a 9.
>Peter_Huszagh: EGMORRS -  +0 215
#note Peter challenges both plays.
>Gunther: EMNRSYZ M3 ZE..S +30 447
#note (EL)MY, Q's top, is the play I wanted to make, but for whatever reason didn't. I missed ENZYM 5F.
>Peter_Huszagh: EJ 9M JE. +18 233
>Gunther: MNORRY B6 MONY +27 474
>Peter_Huszagh: DGRST E7 .......S +16 249
>Gunther: RR 4M .R. +4 478
>Peter_Huszagh: DGRT 4C ..RD +5 254
#note (E)D blocks my out. I thought he would play this.
>Gunther: R 10E .R +4 482
#note The 9 on move 11 was (NA)UGHtIER...
>Gunther:  (GT) +6 488
