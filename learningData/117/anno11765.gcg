>Avery_Mojica: ?AAISTT I10 TA.I +21 119
#note Couldn't find any bingos worth more than about 63. Didn't think it was worth it, so kept fishing. Besides, they opened up the board too much.

>James_Friend: ABEINOR 2A BONIE. +16 307
#note Had one bingo word, two space. Can you find it? That'll give you a hint on where it is though. I got my tracking right and knew he had this, and I was hoping he didn't find it. He didn't.
>Avery_Mojica: AIRRUV N12 VAR. +27 338
