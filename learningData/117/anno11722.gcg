>Denise_Mahnken: DGINOTW -W +0 0
#note She said she was thinking about dumping the D to get an S for STOWING. Personally, DOWING is what I would have played.
>Andy_Hoang: ACEF 8F CAFE +18 18
#note She exchanges one and I need to do something. Now I just sit and pray.
>Denise_Mahnken: DGINOST J2 DOTINGS +75 75
>Denise_Mahnken: DGINOST --  -75 0
#note Well, I guess she decided to gamble. 
>Andy_Hoang: ADO 7H ODA +16 34
#note No available bingos so I try to score and make my rack better.
>Denise_Mahnken: DGINOST J6 T. +4 4
#note I am thinking about her rack and is wondering what is she up to.
>Andy_Hoang: CEP G7 C.P +23 57
#note I have a rack that looks to be at least two turns away from being able to bingo. The board is open but not to helpful for someone holding onto DOINGS. I go for points here and since I have the E and am pretty sure she doesn't, I expose the easy spot for me next turn
>Denise_Mahnken: DGINOS F8 .OD +14 18
#note Why didn't she play CAPO/DO? I don't know. I think she doesn't know her fours. Well now she must be close holding INGS and three other tiles. 
>Andy_Hoang: AEGINNU 11D GUANINE +73 130
#note I didn't know ANGUINE and I almost missed this play. 
>Denise_Mahnken: GINS -  +0 18
#note Uh, maybe she has an unplayable bingo because she challenges GUANINE. After I saw my courtesy draw of AEILPRT, I am hoping she challenges. 
>Andy_Hoang: AEILPRT 5E PLATIER +89 219
#note Now she is devastated. 
>Denise_Mahnken: GINRS K8 RIGS +28 46
#note Maybe she gave up. It just shows how one bad opening move and one lost challenge and turn the whole game around. 
>Andy_Hoang: BBI 4G BIB +19 238
#note time for defense.
>Denise_Mahnken: DNWY H10 W.NDY +13 59
#note Well her once "good" rack is now dead. 
>Andy_Hoang: AEIINOY 8K .AINY +27 265
#note I want to play defensively but the triple is open and this dumps some tiles.
>Denise_Mahnken: EHT 7L THE +23 82
#note I was going to block here next turn but I guess she is helping me to dig her own grave.
>Andy_Hoang: AEELOOO 3G ALOE +21 286
#note Well, at this point, she must have one or both blanks because even though I am up by 183, neither blanks have surfaced. ALOE is second next to DOOLEE H13
>Denise_Mahnken: LL M7 ..LL +8 90
#note No comment on this play. I don't know what she has. But she is really frustrated being down 200 and not even breaking 100. 
>Andy_Hoang: EFIKOOR 13C FORKE. +30 316
#note I play here because it closes down the bottom and I believe she is prepared to bingo. This is the only place to bingo at this moment. Also, it gets rid of tiles to get one of the 2 blanks, 3 s's, Z, J, Q,  or X. None have showed so it is not that i am bagging her.
>Denise_Mahnken: AH 6N HA +27 117
#note Did I mention that she has only 12 minutes at this point while i am still above 21?
>Andy_Hoang: EIMOORU 2J MOOER +36 352
#note We are playing upstairs and the only challenge machine is all the way downstairs and she doesn't seem eager to get up for a THIRD time. So I gamble this one (I was unsure of it but thought it could be good) and it works. 35 points, at the cost of opening it up but cleans my rack.

*Note: Scored as 35
>Denise_Mahnken: JU D9 JU. +11 128
#note Thank goodness she isn't seeing the open O in the L collumn. 
>Andy_Hoang: AEIIOQU 14A QUAI +33 385
#note What is with these vowels? I have two choices, play QUAI @ B6 or down in A14. I choose A14 because I have another I and if she has a bingo, she will play it near J1 leaving the easy 40+ play next turn for me.
>Denise_Mahnken: IN 15A IN +41 169
#note I am thinking now "say what?" But looking at my rack, I am secretly wondering how lucky I could be.
>Andy_Hoang: AEIMNOT 1D AMNIOTE +85 470
#note wow. This is the first time all day this has happened and I tend to rely on my wonderful luck to bail me out. Too bad it came when I didn't need it. 
I feel sorry for her being down this much and me playing another bingo and shutting down the last spot on the board. 
>Denise_Mahnken: ORT 1M ROT +13 182
#note Yep, she gave up. On the game and the bingo.
>Andy_Hoang: ?DEGISW I7 ..W +11 481
#note Back when I played with Erik @ Nationals. I drew like this and he would just stare at me. Unfortunately, no openings and I get greedy and try for a 600 point game.
>Denise_Mahnken: EVX 2B VEX +35 217
#note umm, she must be tired or something because she 1) opened it up, and 2) missed playing it @ M3 for 41. 
>Andy_Hoang: ?DEGISS 3C DE +22 503
#note Seriously! I draw the S NOW? It looks like I bagged her. I play DE and keep both SS because I can set up for next turn. But I am looking out for the stray Z.
>Denise_Mahnken: ?S 4D So +27 244
#note wow, never before have I seen such a waste. Had she even tile-tracked, she would have known that that was a stupid move.
>Andy_Hoang: ?GISSVZ 6B ZIGS +38 541
#note I was thinking that I would never play out. Now I can!
>Denise_Mahnken: EERTU 3L RETE +19 263
#note The only "best" play of the whole game she made.
>Andy_Hoang: ?SV 7A VaS +19 560
#note And, we are finished. 
>Andy_Hoang:  (U) +2 562
