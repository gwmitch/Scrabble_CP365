>Jason_Ubeika: EIIOOPT -IOOP +0 0
#note TOPOI or Exchange keeping EIPT/EPT.
>Jackson_Smylie: DEFIIJU 8E FUJI +28 28
#note I prefer to give him an F in the double double and stay away from 35 point S plays.
>Jason_Ubeika: ??EEIIT 9H dEITIEs +58 58
#note ITEmIsE, but you can't blame him for not looking too long. (U)bIETIEs would be cool ;)
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEEITT E8 .ATE +14 42
#note ADIT. Also (F)ETA is possibly better than (F)ATE, but I liked having the D option open for me. 
>Jason_Ubeika: CHNORY N9 .YNCHRO +44 102
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEIOQT -  +0 42
#note I was a bit idiot for challenging. I should know that it just makes sense as a word, and if I play QI I am only down 36, not a bingo after he hits 15L. Big big big mistake.
>Jason_Ubeika: GY 15M G.Y +21 123
#note He said he had 7 consonants here, and wanted to prevent me from taking the spot.
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEIOQT 8J QI +24 66
>Jason_Ubeika: DELTV 12B VELDT +27 150
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEOORT 13L OO. +12 78
#note DE(V)OTE is good minus what it gives him. I have a few lanes open after OO(H) so I just hope I can get back in. OO(H) sims best.
>Jason_Ubeika: BMNU 12I NUMB +24 174
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEINRT K11 E. +8 86
#note I rushed this turn, and missed DI(V)ER, which I see next turn. DE(V) is nice for the extra lane(s). E(M) simulated near the top, but just doesn't score enough. NE 11I I should've seen. This is a turn where you just use intuition to see how far along the fishing scale you should go. 
>Jason_Ubeika: AV F6 VA. +14 188
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEINRT 6D IN.ERTED +64 150
#note I deserved to draw another E, but not to get a V. 
>Jason_Ubeika: AOP 5I APO +22 210
>Jackson_Smylie: CEEGLPU 4K CUPEL +26 176
#note I see CU(V)EE but I just am not a big fan of GLP.

#note Yeah...
>Jason_Ubeika: MNNORRR 2G M.NOR +9 336
#note To put it lightly, I'm a lucky piece of shit.
>Jackson_Smylie: BEFIORS 15A IF +38 361
#note Emptying the bag may not have been right on his part, but he can't really win.
>Jason_Ubeika: AAENNR 3B NEAR +16 352
>Jackson_Smylie: BEORS 2A ROBE +24 385
#note BORE(A)S. 
>Jason_Ubeika: AN N1 AN +13 365
#note 1C AN. I feel I played quite well this game except for that major blunder that synchronized with a play Jason made early in the game. I think challenging that word and DEEINRT were my only mistakes. Yay
