#note I spent ages here, and I apparently botched the turn. Maybe not horribly, as this is only 3.5 or so back from the sim leaders. But yeah, nothing stands out here and there are lots of good options. OW, WUD, WU(D), (T)OWED. I decided that killing multiple lanes and going up by a bingo seemsed pretty good, but 7H OW and B11 TOWED both outsim this. Guess I misevaluated the equity.

#note lol. Yeah, I knew this was just not a thing to do with this score. But I did it anyways. OPEN is a really clever play I didn't consider.

#note Several brutal plays, due mostly to late-night weariness and laziness. Not a good excuse, but whatever. Don't need to play well with tiles like these, I guess.
