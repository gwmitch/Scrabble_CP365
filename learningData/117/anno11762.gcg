#note Sims 1.2 points over HEAVEN. Quack says putting the N down gives opponents a 2% higher chance to bingo. 
>Kevin_Leeds: IIIO -IIIO +0 0
>Matt_Canik: GINOSTY 7C GOY +19 49
#note Quackle likes OY in the same spot. I was just afraid that something like WRATH would come down in the spot I open, and INST is still quite good. OY bingos 12% more than TOY and 13% more than GOY. Oopsies. 
>Kevin_Leeds: AELN 6B LANE +21 21
>Matt_Canik: INRSTTU I7 INTRUST +72 121
#note In hindsight, I really hate this placement. I was scared of the H1 spot the other spot opened and hastily moved it down here. I had already eaten through a lot of my clock on the previous turn. 
>Kevin_Leeds: BELMRST 11H T.MBLERS +74 95
#note STUMBLER/TUMBRELS too. 
>Matt_Canik: EEOORSU 10G EU.O +14 135
#note The board is so wide open with the ALANE hook that I don't really care about that S and I'll just do what's best for my rack.

#note I didn't know PRAHU. I played this because I was being greedy. I knew he'd leave open the 3x3 hoping for a miracle.
