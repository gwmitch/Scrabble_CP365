#note I see HIJRAHS for 106!  So close.
#note Quackle prefers an exchange or SHH (which is interesting).

#note Small confession: I'm more likely to play French words against Sue.  This one's not valid in our dictionary, though it has a meaning in psychoanalysis.
#note This word has been in the French media a lot in the context of the Communauté Urbaine de Montréal (CUM) as various small municipalities have broken away from the imposed amalgamation of 2002.

#note Sue has three out-plays: H11 DEANS +32, D11 SANED +22, 1F AN(O)DES +7.  I'm willing to bet that she's not sure of SANED/GIDS.  This seems to be the best block, under that premise.
