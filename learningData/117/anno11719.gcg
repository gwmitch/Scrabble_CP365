#note ok, so this is a terrible move.  Truth is I couldn't remember 100% if it was LAGUNOS* or LANUGOS.  I was 99% sure it was LANUGOS but with the 5 point challenge you have to be sure.

#note Champ player agrees.  I really considered 13a BRR but was worried about (B)IZ.  Maybe I should have blocked bingos to the S.    

Anyone have a view on this position?

#note KIDDO went through my head as I was thinking through the position for about 7 minutes I then failed to play it.  No idea why I forgot.   Fortunately as the tiles came out it was still going to be a loss.
