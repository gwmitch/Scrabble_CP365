>George_Latis: NO 8H ON +4 4
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGGHOW 9G WHO +22 22
#note Forgot about HOWE and HOGG. I would have rather played HOGG.
>George_Latis: JN H7 J..N +14 18
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGGOX 10E EXO. +32 54
#note OXE(N) instead obviously, this makes it way too easy to double-double. I didn't know the word EXOGEN.
>George_Latis: ACDEPRT E4 CARPET.D +102 120
#note See.... that simple error just threw away the whole game. *thumbs down*
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEEGG D11 AGEE +13 67
#note Forgot about WHOA. I tried to open up another easy hook assuming I can get a bingo within a few turns.
>George_Latis: AIMZ 8A MAIZ. +78 198
#note George was chuckling at his good fortune. I couldn't help but laugh either, even though I basically screwed myself with EXO(N).
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGLNT C3 BLEAT.NG +76 143
#note I needed that.
>George_Latis: DEH B4 EDH +33 231
#note George, I can't win if you keep scoring!
>Matthew_Larocque: DEENNTY A1 DYNE +31 174
#note Or NE(E)DY, but this spot was too easy to use, and it opens more.
>George_Latis: IV 13B VI. +12 243
>Matthew_Larocque: DEKNNRT G9 ..NK +11 185
#note I half thought this wasn't even a word. WONK and WANK are both good, WONG and WANG are both invalid.
>George_Latis: AU B13 .AU +12 255
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENORT 4E .ARTONED +74 259
#note I needed that too.
>George_Latis: ?EILOSU 1A .ELUSIOn +77 332
#note noooooooo
>Matthew_Larocque: EELRSTT 13G SETTLER +81 340
#note Okay, so I still don't even know if WONK is a word. But the other bingo options offer him easy points and score much less. Also, I didn't know this anagrammed into STERLET.
>George_Latis: FI 2E IF +28 360
>Matthew_Larocque: IOORRUW 3I WOO +23 363
#note Despite the leave, there's not really a lot of  high scoring plays here. Sim and Champ rate this high. Despite back-to-back bingos, I'm still only sitting at 25% to win. Clearly I need that last blank.
>George_Latis: AM A14 AM +26 386
>Matthew_Larocque: IIIRRRU -IIIRRRU +0 363
#note Barf. Probably should have kept an R, though.
>George_Latis: AEFGY L10 AGU.FY +34 420
>George_Latis: AEFGY --  -34 386
#note I only remembered AGUELIKE and AGUISH, so I challenged.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABILPSV 12L BAP +24 387
#note The free turn really gives me a shot to make a comeback. I took a big gamble here but 	 probably shouldn't have in hindsight. VIABL(E) scores 30 and leaves the s-hook intact. If he ends up bingoing to SETTLER, I still get to use the TWS. With my play of BAP it's all-or-nothing.
>George_Latis: FOY 11K FOY +29 415
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILRSV O7 CIVILS +45 432
#note This is phony, but if it stays it's the best play by a pretty big margin.
>George_Latis: A K13 .A +2 417
#note Well looks like I'm not getting the last blank. 
>Matthew_Larocque: IIIQRRU 10J QI +36 468
#note Wow, I feel stupid now. If I play (T)UI, he can't bingo! And I have two TLS squares that I can use for my Q. I was overtime, so I probably still wouldn't have won. But I shouldn't have been ovetime and I should have played (T)UI instead of letting him have a free bingo. Despite that double-double mistake, I still could have won. But I wasted to much time thinking about WONK and then thinking about putting an S on WONK and other crap. Final score was entered as 458-504.
