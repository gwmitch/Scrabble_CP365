>Morris_Greenberg: ADIIILT -II +0 0
#note M: I think I was biased by incorrectly playing through this kind of rack earlier in the tournament. ILIAD is fine.

>Morris_Greenberg: AFIORTY 2M FOY +27 160
#note M: Maybe (D)AY J8 instead.
>Thomas_Reinke: DGILOSU 1N GO +28 154

>Thomas_Reinke: DIJLOSU 15G JUDOS +50 204
>Morris_Greenberg: ACIKRTT 12I KA.T +16 208
#note M: I convinced myself that I was making  up KR(a)IT. I also didn't know AKR(a)TIC. I almost played ATT(a)CK, then switched it to this.
>Thomas_Reinke: IILRSVY 13J L.IRY +18 222
#note T: Tempting to exchange, but this scores a bit without giving much back.
>Morris_Greenberg: CILNRRT N10 CIT. +15 223
#note M: (FE)RRIC was the word I was looking for.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEISVW 4L AW +23 245
#note T: Keeping with the theme of not giving anything back. At all.
>Morris_Greenberg: AELNRRZ G13 RA. +11 234
#note M: So crazy it just might work.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIMSUV 2E VUM +14 259
#note T: Took a long time here, still couldn't come up with 6F UVEA.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEILNRZ F12 LEZ +65 299
#note M: Quackle slightly prefers REZ.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEIMNS E6 NEMESIA +70 329
#note T: 9 points is worth opening up the E at 8E.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEINPRU D12 PIU +20 319
#note M: PNEU(M)A
>Thomas_Reinke: EHIIOST F8 ETH +33 362
#note T: 8A ISTHMI is cool but not really better, especially if I think he has the blank. I wanted to score; this does that. Mission accomplished.
>Morris_Greenberg: AAEEINR J2 I.A.E +21 340
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIOOSV D1 VOES +31 393
#note T: When in doubt, score as much as you can and hope for the best. That's my mantra, and even though it sucks as far as mantras as go, I stuck to it here. And what do you know; this actually sims pretty decently.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGNOPR C11 NOG +20 360
#note M: Keeping AEGNR is super good here. (C)OP 7K all the way.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?FGIINO C3 FOIlING +88 481
#note T: Nothing like drawing FGN? after keeping IIO.
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEEOPR B6 APE +16 376
#note M: 7K (C)APE to set up ROBE right above it instead.
