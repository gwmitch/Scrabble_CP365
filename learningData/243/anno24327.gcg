#note I didn't like slotting the D in the triple-triple line, so I chose this over DIVAN and DIVA. Quackle slightly prefers those though.

>Morris_Greenberg: DDISUUY 10I .UDDY +12 111
#note I chose this over DU(D)DY because I need to keep the board open since I'm behind. Quackle slightly prefers DUDDY though.

>Morris_Greenberg: DEGGSTW L1 TW.GGED +28 213
#note W(I)GGED is also interesting. They seem pretty equally good options. Since both blanks are out, I was going for turnover.
>David_Pearl: AILOR O3 .AILOR +21 233
>Morris_Greenberg: EHIILRS 1J LI.HER +27 240
#note (S)AILOR last turn implies no blank. Therefore, turnover is probably a fine strategy here, as the bag is pretty promising. Quackle agrees even without assuming he kept two nonblank tiles.

#note I thought the unseen pool was AEEGHINOOO instead of AEEGHIMNOO. This would win 100% of the time with the incorrect tracked pool, and wins 98% of the time (59/60 possible situations) with the correct one. Still, playing it safe with Z(E)BU 6B or BURNT 13J is obviously better, and I would've done one of those if I tracked correctly.
