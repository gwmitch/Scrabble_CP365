#note Inflection point of the tournament right here. Didn't do nearly enough analysis of the position. Ian's surely keeping well (AIRS? or something) and almost certainly not keeping JWY. That means I should expect to draw that stuff after my play, and whatever play I make should give me options in case he hits a bingo. Next, where to block? Many of the things he can have on row 3 also play on column M through the S (AcRASIA/AcRA(S)IAS, AqUARIA/mAIA(S)AUR, AbROSIA[or rOSARIA or SOlARIA]/AbRO(S)IAS, etc.), and for every word like fUSARIA that I block by blocking row 3, he has another one that plays down column M and not row 3. Also, the score is such that getting extra points for VILEST or DEVIOUS could be the difference between winning or losing. Since blocking the S seems to be about as good as blocking row 3, VILEST looks pretty good. DEVIOUS also looks good, and would win if I drew JIVY or JOVIAL through the V at 4C. CP puts VOLE at just under 95% to win but of course it's much lower than that given LOXED.
