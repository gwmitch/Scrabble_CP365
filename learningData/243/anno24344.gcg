#note unsuccessful challenge, SUS
>Matthew_Ridout: EHLOSTU K5 HUE +19 121
#note OH 2A.   Speedy player liked mine better. 
 Maybe was too early to be thinking overly about position, but I just wasn't prepared to leave that dws-dws lane open another round.

>Matthew_Ridout: DELOSTU 1J OUTLED +29 150
#note CP actually liked DOUT 8K just as much.   I'm not down -that- much, and even with the case S in hand, there's the other blank unseen.  I hate that idea.
>Nedd_Kareiva: AF 2N FA +23 198
>Matthew_Ridout: DEEMRRS 8K DERME +35 185
#note better than all valid suggestions frm CP.  I got greedy, knwing this was invalid, but figured he'd already been burned challening SUS and wouldn't risk another lost turn on a non-gamebreakng play

#note HELP!   
CP likes REJIG M8 best.    Sure I've got the case S and blank, but the area could still get mucked up.   My play basically leaves me just down a tempo with the blank still in hand

#note exchange 4
>Matthew_Ridout: ?IRVWXZ -VWXZ +0 227
#note oX burning the blank for 35 at 8A best on CP report.   the exhcange I wish 'd made was just keeping ?R, which didn't even make the list of suggesstions.  guess I was just clueless on this hot mess.

#note IXIA 5F.    Gives away 17 points, yet I've just cut the immediate usefullness of my blank.

#note OVA B1 and VIA 5G are 100% to win per CP.   My play didn't even get to 90%.

>Matthew_Ridout: ?IIQRWZ 6F QI +33 310
#note Figured he'd pitched the Q, so I set up this QI play.   Maybe this is reckless, but i figured I could block the spot if I hadnt pulled the Q here and now.
