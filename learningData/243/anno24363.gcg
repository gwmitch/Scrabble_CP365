#note Didn't feel like FENNEL would ever work out that great for me, but maybe I should try it. It's not like PREX is so great.

#note Terrible job by me not keeping the T here. I realized it right after hitting the clock. I was deciding between 6I QUIT and the plays making HOAX and neglected to realize that keeping the T for next turn was critical.

>Will: AELNNQU L6 N.L +15 220
#note Now I feel forced to waste my time setting up QUIN. Maybe I should play QUEZAL instead, but the score was close enough that I felt I could wait, even against David. Maybe that's misguided. I missed C7 ELAN/LOCULI.

#note I might need to play VENAE now.

#note Not too many hits here (HIIOO for sevens under VAGUE and the L for SIGNALMEN), but better than nothing
>David: HO B14 OH +23 331
#note Another ominous move. No attempt to block...
>Will: AEEGMNN N7 ..NG +9 302

#note Blocking SPIVS O11, but it's better to block SPAVIES with RAMIE.
