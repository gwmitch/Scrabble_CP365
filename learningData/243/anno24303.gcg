#note maybe LEZ instead to give back fewer easy overlaps. If I know SNOOZLE, I might play it to draw a challange (and if he doesn't know the DS hooks)

#note I liked this over HABU cause it doesn't leave another J column lane, and the U isn't a big threat to deal with

>Jackson_Smylie: ABKOSTU 2J OTAKU +26 170
#note played this cause I figured there was a decent chance he doesn't know it doesn't take an S. OUTASK/TEXTS is another play I can consider. I didn't feel he was holding super strong, so I'm happy to deal with the top now and then make a better blocking play with TEXTS next turn.

#note was very close to playing gabs but then talked myself into this! I have played this a few times and can never seem to remember it right... Wish I had trusted my initial feeling here, rather than gone on me recognizing it.
