#note wasn't a fan of CLOD over exchanging here, as I want to avoid more disastrous racks. CLQ is by no means good, but a could vowels and I could be okay. I mainly wanted to block up the board here, preventing big double doubles and such

#note interestingly, exch. CV is the second highest static play, after VEG! I wanted to keep QUA possibilities alive for sure, which is why I opted out of VEG. He doesn't play on the 14 row too often, but if he bingoes with SH, which happens a fair bit, it's nice to have QUA in reserve. VEG is good because it kills the top left, but it's not super easy to open after CELLO anyways. I like that cello doubles my chances at playing qua next turn, or drawing something else, cause it will score and close down sections

#note the board is bad for bingoes, which is why I elected to score with EXES, but he will open up like this a lot, so bingo leaves get a bit better than they should

#note NUDE is really sexy but gonna just block here. I liked keeping the D on the chance I draw the last E or the ?
