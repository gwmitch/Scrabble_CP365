#note This is a bad play naively. IVY 7F is 10-11 equity higher. However, I saw that Michael tends to rely on bingos, and opening both sides of the board for that seemed to be unideal here. Additionally, it is likely here that he left three 1 pointers, and probably 2 vowels, so I can sacrifice some points here in the short term without losing much of a lead often. I am probably wrong, but I doubt this is 11 points worse.

#note Quackle much prefers N(I)QAB. To me, Michael seems like he's keeping something like ERT, and I thought that blocking these two lanes was more important than blocking the V and I. Quackle says with that inference, Michael bingos 5% more often with QA(T) than N(I)QAB next turn, and averages 3 more points per turn overall on average. Maybe I'm underrating 7s that end in O (for OPAH hook), but I am very confused by this result.

#note I knew this was phony, but it's such a good phony. (R)ENIN actually sims pretty close, but I prefer this.

#note I missed (V)IGIL, but both seem reasonable. It is fine to leave this lane open because I'd likely bingo back right above any bingo Michael plays.

#note VIE screamed fish to me, so I want to groom my rack without giving easy bingo spots. I missed L11 YIN to do that more effectively.

#note This is a super tough position, and I didn't have a ton of time to figure it out. I wasn't even sure if bingoing is right here, because it empties the bag and if Michael bingoes out, then I probably lose because I picked up the X. Additionally, CALIX and CAREX are 64 point plays, and suddenly that 94 point lead doesn't look as safe even if Michael cannot bingo in some situations.

Quackle suggests DUOTONe 14D. That blocks most of his binoges. It also prefers OUTDO 2C, to not empty the bag. I straight up missed NUTwOOD as well, which is a better equity version of the DUOTONe I played since the X counterplays are much weaker.
