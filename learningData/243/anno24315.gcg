>Jackson_Smylie: EEENOOX -EEOO +0 0
#note it's silly that I end this tournament with a 541. Q prefers OXO... I wasn't a fan of the easy overlaps and potentially dangerous leave. keeping EN might also be better, or EX. 
>Matthew_Ridout: OY 8G YO +10 10
>Jackson_Smylie: ADELNNX G7 L.NX +16 16
#note XYLAN is a nice play, slightly aggressive. LYNX is a lot more defensive - if he doesn't bingo he doesn't score very much. I think with a bingo leave LYNX does better

#note dangered for a bit more? I prefer the fewer lanes this gives back

#note or AHI. I do like UH's defense though, and I"m not a fan of HAUTE

#note interestingly only VErMEI(L)S as a bingo here, which I missed, though I saw the potential for the word through the R in DROUK. VERMIS or VERISM are better though. I'm fine with keeping this game risk free and taking my small cash prize

#note I'm glad I went to nationals, and had fun besides the scrabble. I felt I was playing well during the tournament, but Joey was right to tell me I was being an idiot and definitely playing badly. My biggest issues were overthinking things, playing too paranoidly, and missing plays. I need to work most on my board vision, and over the board spend more time actually searching for plays. I misplayed a lot of things strategically, and really didn't have a good idea of how to adapt to play division 2 players. I would like to learn better, and most importantly, actually follow through with the concepts I know. Many times I just didn't think clearly, maybe out of frustration at the tournament, and maybe because I was focusing too much on "what do I do against a div b player?" rather than focusing on the game and optimizing that. I don't regret choosing to play division 2.
