>Siri_Tillekerante: ACDR 9C CARD +19 19
>Morris_Greenberg: AEJLNNY H4 JNAN. +20 40
#note I didn't know the new JANNEY, but that plays at 7C for 45 points!
>Siri_Tillekerante: EIRSU 4H .URIES +26 45
>Morris_Greenberg: BEHLPRY C9 .YPHER +32 72
#note I was choosing between I8 HYP and this. Even though I have an E and not an S, it is likelier Siri has an E over an S too. Leaving that double-double on a closed-ish board doesn't seem like a gamble worth taking.
>Siri_Tillekerante: EOW B13 WOE +21 66
>Morris_Greenberg: ABCLLVZ K1 CAV.L +20 92
#note I had been making crossword puzzles recently, and convinced myself that LOR was a word used in crosswords and not added to the new dictionary, so I chickened out of ALB A13. Pretty big mistake.
>Siri_Tillekerante: ?EEIITT J4 .ETInITE +63 129
>Morris_Greenberg: BGILMTZ 2J G.MBIT +30 122
#note (C)LIMB is also an option.
>Siri_Tillekerante: ADVY K11 DAVY +28 157
>Morris_Greenberg: DFGILLZ I11 FIZ +32 154
#note This looks like a mistake now. I was focused on keeping up with scoring, but I should realize that a play like GILL I9 leaves me in much better shape for next turn.
>Siri_Tillekerante: ADGO A12 DAGO +40 197
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DEGLLS 10F DEL +17 171
#note I missed L(Y)SED here. E(N)G(I)LD 7G is also a very nice option that I didn't see.

>Siri_Tillekerante: O M1 ..O. +12 258
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EEGNST F12 .EG +12 205
#note I was choosing between (K)EG and T(Y)E here. I decided to do KEG now, because if he has one of the 2 unseen S's, he would probably immediately block KEG, and I could then do TYE next turn.
>Siri_Tillekerante: AA E14 AA +5 263
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ENNRST 12K .N +4 209
#note I wanted to keep the ETS for TYE to STYE opportunities. Fwiw, Quackle suggests (A)STERN for 27
>Siri_Tillekerante: BINRU M9 BURIN +23 286
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EFNRST 15D F.STER +48 257
#note This is better than FENeSTR(A), as that's a pretty weak bingo.
>Siri_Tillekerante: ENOT 5D TENO. +10 296
#note Siri first played ET G5, and then switched to this.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?IINPQR N8 QI +15 272
#note Since Siri put down ET last turn, we can infer he didn't have an I since IT would be the played ahead of ET. So, there's a 50% chance that Siri drew the I. If he didn't, he'll be in a tough position. Quackle says QuIR(T) wins 48% of the time, while this wins 30%. However, that does not take into account that Siri probably wasn't holding an I, so all racks are not created equal here. It is a damn risky move, but I think it's right in this situation.
