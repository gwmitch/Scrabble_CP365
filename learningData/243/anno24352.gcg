#note again, decrease variance and play defense. LUNT E7 does both these things. it's so hard to convince myself to play like that but that's an elite level play. -1

#note i missed 4A BLOWN or L1 BLOWN. actually, i don't think i missed them, just underevaluated them properly.  i didn't want to open the board with two unseen blanks. -8 but not really.

#note for some reason, quackle prefers plays at L3 -- VERB, VET, VAT. equity wise these are far better than VAC of course, but i just can't allow him to bingo.

#note this only wins 72% of the time, but it is the highest. i actually went through all his possible racks for bingoes starting with an A but didn't even think of ZETA. this loses to the racks where he can make ZEaTIN or ZEaTINS -- so EINTZ? + E(2), I(2), S(4) and the two racks where he has cENTESI(MI).
