#note only partially blocks the lane, so now it has to be an S-----S or -----SS bingo. TAV is dangerous cause if he drops an R or O after MIME, it's really hard for me to deal with. I considered tavern for a while to set up taverna, but he probably knows it and could score very well there. I actually blocked his bingo here, apparently. I don't like any of the blocks here.

#note SHUNTERS is becoming big - I'm hoping he doesn't know or see it, but I still want to block it soon. considered BUNK, but I want to keep a vowel to deal with some openings he might make. YOND at least takes out the last possibility of the 14d lane

#note no bingoes here. BOwHUNTERS is cool. I considered BI to set up more letters to play there. BE was to create another lane for spread, though.

#note only bingo! I might have missed UPBOILS or CUBOIDS, the two words that fit up top
