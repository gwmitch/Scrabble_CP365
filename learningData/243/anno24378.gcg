#note G6 WINZE, if I want to score FEWER points. Come ON Quackle, are you serious? Last time I checked (which was just now, actually), Scrabble is about score MORE points than your opponent. Jeez.

#note Spent a long time on this play, eventually I got so tired of looking at the letters that I played as many of them as I could.

#note I thought I smelled a setup for 13L plays making EXCEL, so I blocked. The problem is that I probably need to draw the C and play there to win, 2D plays score too much for me to win after this. D2 FID is the play.
