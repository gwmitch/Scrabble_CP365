#note cBB: Not sure here. I was almost positive I had a bingo-tell on Joey, but there were so many lines here, it wasn't like I could do much. EBON 14K wins the sim - it looks nice, but it's a bit too volatile for what I need here. Perhaps the simple L10 (F)OB was best - but that may be hindsight since it would have blocked his bingo...

#note YAWP or YAWN or even YAW at 13L are better. This play is not good.

#note I guess I should hold the N back, yeah.
>Joey_Krafchick: ?LNOSUY N1 OY +20 313
#note Joey: SULfONY(L). cBB: OK, I can't really fault him for missing that one. That's super low prob.

#note cBB: Hm. Quackle says I should break up the rack with (B)O(X)IEST. I'm not sure - there's no guaranteed he can block everything, and if he does, he may have to break up a good rack and/or score few points.

#note cBB: So I knew what was left in the bag, but I didn't see Joey's winning play. Assuming I do see it, should I try to come up with a play here, or do I just have to hope he doesn't find it? It's not exactly staring him in the face, and I don't really see how I can fish here. Maybe I should have looked a bit longer before bingoing, but I wanted to play while he was still a bit shocked by the phony coming off.

#note Joey: QuAD 10B wins 100% of the time, my play none (I saw no win, best play that I could see)
