#note he exchanged "old macdonald" face up. don't you agree that exchanging face up gives a lot of information? :)
>cesar: ADGOOPU E7 P.GODA +20 54
#note i was torn between 9F PAD and 9G ADO but didn't like those leaves enough and also I'm scared of closed boards for some reason. it is pretty dumb to give up a 60-0 lead on a closed board, so my move has to be significantly worse. i just don't like making moves like PAD or AGO so i need to learn. (-4)
>mike_f: AEEEINT 11E .ETAINEE +68 68
#note i thought an exch 5 would still be sorta random but oh well
>cesar: DEFIOUY F10 F.Y +35 89
#note this time it's worth keeping a better leave with 10H or D12 YOU apparently. (-2.5)
>mike_f: GINX H11 .XING +63 131
#note crap me
>cesar: DEILOOU D12 LOUD +26 115
#note I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SUCCESSFULLY PLAYED THE WORD OUZO. (-1) D12 DUO sims better though.

>cesar: EEIINOS M7 OI +10 125
#note eh, bad move :( ENVOI is much better. ionize is cool too. (-6.5)
>mike_f: IQ G13 QI +44 199
>cesar: EEINORS -E +0 125
#note all sorts of bad. if not 10J ENVOI then 10H ROE. i have to stop him from scoring too and while i do desperately need a bingo, it can wait a turn. (-15)

#note maybe VOE, quackle likes N7 ONE which is kind of cool (-2)

#note i am in no way thrilled about B6 DOULA after VENT and HM so that can't be right. OUD B13 looks better than my move though. (-6)

#note total clownshoes, missed the bingo from the G. (-7)

>cesar: CDNNOOT 2F DON. +9 369
#note cool, this seems to be the move with the highest win % on many ply at 16%. 4C DON is pretty dumb.
>mike_f: BEIILNS 1D BLINI +41 446
#note from his point of view he picked the highest % winner - leaving one in the bag is 75% and everything else is 94.44%. would i go on to pull off an improbable 5% win???
>cesar: CCEINOT B3 CONCEIT +69 438
#note yes! notice i missed a better play. (-20)
