>moh: ABEEELR 8G BEE +10 10
>asif: ?AIIMRT J6 AIRTIMe +68 68
#note Lots of bingo options here. I prefer hitting H1 with MARITIm(E). MARTINI, SIMITAR, and AIRTIME are all about the same.
>moh: AEEKLNR I7 K.EL +30 40
#note K(E)EL is best. Most of the other decent plays put the K in the same spot (AKEE, KEA, RAKEE, etc.). I7 L(E)AKER 29 is interesting, but I'd rather keep my bingo-prone tiles together.
>asif: CDLOU K2 COULD +19 87
#note Asif should have played COULD one spot lower for 7 more points.
>moh: AEINRSS 4E SENARI.S +68 108
#note 13H ARSINES 75 scores better, but I hated slotting the A at 13H (any heavy consonant will be able to punish me by playing down to the triple at 15H). ERASI(O)NS and ARSENI(C)S are fine, too.
>asif: AHLM H1 HAM.L +30 117
>moh: DINPRRU K10 DURN +23 131
#note K10 PURIN or PURR are better than my DURN in the same place. They both have better leaves (although I don't really like opening up row 15 with PURIN).
>asif: AEEPY 3A PAYEE +22 139
#note While I don't know Asif's other tiles, it's hard to come up with a rack where this is the best play. I would only open up a triple with a play that scored very well on a board like this. A play like I2 EY(R)A scores more and doesn't offer much back to one's opponent here.
>moh: AEILPRT B2 P.RIETAL +74 205
#note PARIETAL is the only bingo here.
>asif: AHR A6 RAH +37 176
#note RAH looks fine.
>moh: ANSTTVX E2 V..T +14 219
#note I didn't really like this play at the time, but the computer sim says it's best. It meets my basic needs here: undouble the TT, get rid of the V, keep my only vowel if possible, and retain XS for scoring on later turns. 12G TAV(ER)N is also reasonable.
>asif: EIOZ 2K .OZIE +32 208
#note Why open huge hotspots with such reckless abandon? G2 ZO(N)E scores the same but doesn't offer so much to the opponent. Of course when you play with fire...
>moh: ?ANSTTX O1 S.XTANTs +185 404
#note Doesn't take a wizard to figure out the best play here.
>asif: EOT A1 TO.E +28 236
#note Looks fine (but once again, I don't know what Asif's letters were)
>moh: CEGIIOW C8 WIG +20 424
#note This play sims best. Undouble the II, get rid of the W...score reasonably well. When we figure out exactly what a play needs to accomplish, often there's only one play that fits the bill, and that makes decisions pretty easy.
>asif: AQ 7M QA. +22 258
>moh: CEFGIOV 8L VIG. +25 449
#note There are not many scoring opportunities on this board now for me (I don't have an A for M3 or an S for 14K; no play can stretch from D9 down to D12, and there aren't really any other spots). Underlapping the Q is one obvious exception, and both FIGS and VIGS are decent there.
>asif: BENO D9 BONE +20 278
>moh: CDEEFOO 13A FOOD +24 473
#note Or FEOD in the same spot.
>asif: GJ B12 J.G +22 300
>moh: CDEEIOO L10 ODE +23 496
#note Mine was the only play that scores more than 20 points. It also keeps at least one consonant and undoubles my OO and EE, so it was pretty obvious. Computer 
>asif: AY A13 .AY +30 330
>moh: CEIORSW 14E COWRIES +72 568
#note I guess I drew pretty well here :-).
