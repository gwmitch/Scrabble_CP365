#note wasn't sure of this and it definately became problematic because it closed down the board.  I may have been better off playign oka @3c.  Several scoring options.

#note Played this totally forgetting about juga.  I remembered it couldn't take an s though.  This took care of some nasty tiles.

>Brett: EEIRSTV J1 EVITERS +77 284
>Brett: EEIRSTV --  -77 207
#note Wasn't sure if this was good but had to go for it.  VERITES or VERIEST would have worked.

#note I was expecting to get punished for this...just fishing away.
>Jacqueline: BCEOPTT 10J DON +24 320
#note no q i guess...or maybe she was hoping for a t or didn't want to use her blank...
>Brett: EIIQRST 1A EF +26 251
>Jacqueline: BCEEPTT 11K RET +20 340
#note Definitely no Q, killing the only available spot.

#note Sometimes it's about luck!  I wil take it!  I wonder if she would have won had she played za @ 7n, then eaten the q, because I drew some relatively bad tiles.  
>Jacqueline: ?EELPQZ 3L ZEP. +30 385
#note She starts to freak out on time.  It's a virtual dead heat.   
>Brett: CIOY L1 CO.Y +42 384
#note Almost played zoic, then spotted the more suitable cozy, BAM!  I might not be going for spread but the win! 
>Jacqueline: ?ELQ 2J Qu. +31 416
>Jacqueline: ?ELQ --  -31 385
#note She put this down and hit her clock and then pulled the tiles back up and I told her what she did.  Time is definitely a factor in this game.  All she had to do was play qUey for 14, and then my best play would be Qi, losing by 3.  Good player though.  Just minor meltdown near the end.
