#note If I were sure that GOODY was valid, I would have played that...getting rid of an O as well would have been worthwhile. My play isn't far behind though.

#note Another miss: 3D ESOTERI(C). I've played this word before too, but was focused on the open G and V. My play was 2nd at least, a distant 2nd but still :-)

#note I wasn't sure what to make of this play. A second blank, maybe? I should have asked Adam what his rack was here...I'm curious.

#note This was a critical gaffe, mixing up OXALATE, OZALID, OXALIS...several similar words. Otherwise 1L AX(L)E 36 or even 1K AXi(L)E 57 are the likely play. 13B EX is Q's top choice, I'm not sure I would have the guts to leave that top row open...all better than phonying though.

#note Effectively shutting down the right side of the board, unless a 9 happens through IT or OY. The challenge and WHELM pretty much decided this one -- a miracle could still happen, but that's what I need here more or less.
>deen: ?AADELO C3 mELOD.A +37 293
#note If I'd seen ALODIA in the same spot, I'd have opted for that, saving my blank. I think it's pretty unlikely to save in any case, but the blank would make a 9 through IT a bit more plausible. Once again, time was becoming a factor, so I doubt if it would have mattered...but objectively better I think. At least I was in the right part of the board -- I really wanted A(W)LED to be a word, to use an awl...no? LOL
