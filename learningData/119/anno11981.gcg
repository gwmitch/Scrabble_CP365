#note IDOl(A)TER for 97...wow, Quackle (Scrabble playing program) is GOOD!
>adam_logan: AEFGMOR 13C FROMAGE. +82 159
#note How does he do that? OK, you also need to know FROMAGE is acceptable in our dictionary, but drawing a bingo out of the bag after just playing one? LOL...I saw him get 5 in a row one night at club -- amazing.
>deen: EKLNRRY 14E RYE +33 123
#note H10 K(I)N(G)LY 45 is a great play. I wasn't wild about keeping 4 consonants, but it was points and killed the TWS. BTW, this is how lesser mortals draw after a bingo...LOL
>adam_logan: AJOS M11 SOJA +31 190
>deen: DKLNQRT 12L D.RK +34 157
#note More consonants, my punishment...my play ranks 2nd behind 14K TR(A)NQ, dumping Q and getting rid of a 4th consonant.
>adam_logan: CEFHI 15A FICHE +54 244
>deen: ?DLNQTU 14K QU.D +28 185
#note QUANT in the same spot is interesting, but I was keeping -LIKE bingoes on column O open holding L?
>adam_logan: AIIL 12A ILIA +19 263
>deen: ?BEELNT 7I B.LE +18 203
#note Missed 4(!) bingoes here: 7F NEtT(A)BLE, NEsT(A)BLE, rEBLENT, hooking onto IOTA above or below, and 6C BEETLiN(G). The last one I saw, but was too unsure of. I'd also seen BLENT, but didn't know REBLENT was good.
>adam_logan: HLLOU 10B HULLO +24 287
>deen: ?AEEINT 15H ANTI +23 226
#note Drew AIE to ENT? Should not have missed D3 TrEENAI(L), but was frustrated to have nowhere for ETEsIAN or TAENIaE or ArENITE etc....looked at column D but got hung up on -AL or -IAL options...Scrabble is hard :-) My play here isn't terrible, but INTA(K)E is much better if I don't bingo. 
>adam_logan: INZ L4 ZIN. +26 313
>deen: ?BEEPRV G5 VERB +17 243
#note Another miss here..."one letter off PROVERB, with B(IOTA)...too bad PrEVERB isn't good" :-( And, of course, Adam was quick to mention that PREVERB is actually good! Makes playing VERB with P?E on your rack a pretty dumb looking play, but it all hinges on the depth of your word knowledge...
>adam_logan: AENOSTU 3H SOUTANE +80 393
>deen: ?CEEOPT N1 TO.PiECE +76 319
#note Four 76 pt. bingoes here: TO(E)PiECE at 9H or N1, PiCOTEE and COmPETE at 2B. I saw COMPETE and the easier TOEPIECE, opting for opening the triple-triple on line 1. COMPETE might have been actually better, to keep more 8s in contention for the next turn. But anything is risky and not terribly likely to work -- very small chances of a turnaround in any case.

#note Splat - this seals it...

>deen: AINNNS O3 SIN +18 385
#note Missed an out here with NANNI(E)S, but I actually went overtime by part of one minute in this game and one other. Adam plays very quickly, and if you have a long think at some point, you are likely going to be short of time against him...

Final Score was 514-375.
