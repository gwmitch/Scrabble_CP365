#note KUFI actually wins the sim, despite not being the top static choice. Cool!

#note When I saw this rack, I got really enamored by the potential to either hit ZA 3G or QI C7, then I tried to find plays that allowed me to do either.... I just don't know why I missed QU(I)R(E)D
>Scott_Appel: EILOSTT 11D LITOTES +68 181
>Matt_Canik: DILOQUZ H1 QUI.L +42 183
#note QUILL is actually simming above QUOLL, probably because QUILL allows more Z plays at 3G next turn. 
>Scott_Appel: CDLUY L8 CL.UDY +30 211
>Matt_Canik: ADGMOTZ 3G Z.G +46 229
#note Maybe that's why QUILL was higher. 
>Scott_Appel: AJR B8 RAJ +32 243
>Matt_Canik: ADMOORT M11 MOO +27 256
#note Quackle wants me to play MOOD instead. I don't know if I want to upen that line with two esses and two blanks out. 
>Scott_Appel: EFHI H11 .HIEF +45 288
>Matt_Canik: ADENNRT A1 NAN. +19 275
#note With a lot of Es and a lot of Ns in the bag, NANA just seems to make more sense than NADA. Quackle disagrees.

>Matt_Canik: AEINRTX 15A NIXE +50 417
#note This is bad. His bingo didn't have a blank in it, and I didn't draw one after mine. I *could* fish off the X. But if that happens, his bingo will outscore mine (assuming I pull one at all) and I'll lose. NIXE is mostly to save spread, and if he doesnt have a bingo I think he always loses after this. I suppose if I play EX C14, I can play NIXE AFTER he bingos and pick up some more spread.
