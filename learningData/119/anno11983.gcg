#note The only bingo!...curiously Adam suggested that G8 (J)EE 11 might be close or better, foregoing the bingo to not create such dangerous hotspots. JEE is actually 2nd choice from Quackle (!), but well behind in the sims.
>deen: ACEINOT 14H C.EATION +74 96
#note I couldn't decide between this and 14B ACTIONE(R). Both entail risks. Adam preferred my choice.

#note 2nd behind K4 GYVES 36 according to the Duck :-)

#note Saw the top play H1 EGEStIV(E) for 4 extra points, but couldn't remember if it was good or not. Not worth the risk for 4 pts...

>deen: CELNNUW 6J W.NCE +20 220
#note Tough call between this and just W(I)N in the same spot. My choice dangles a hook on the triple lane, a bit risky.

#note This is either a 2nd S, or a lot of vowels and a desire to score -- possibly both. A valliant effort to clean up the rack with an obscure word in any case, but I was lucky to draw into an exploitation of this.

#note Drew ABDIZ to TY. Lucky. I was feeling pretty good about this one now.

#note 8A PAEA(N) is 3 extra points...I did see it, but decided to keep the lines a bit more shut down. Possibly a bit paranoid, but I've seen Adam's bingoes before...LOL

#note L1 Q(I) 21 doesn't empty the bag, but I was so far ahead now that even an outbingo, which looks extremely unlikely given the remaining tile pool, didn't look like it would be close to catching up...

#note I have several outs, SWAB or WABS, so it doesn't much matter. Quackle's cute 4K (g)U(A)RD 14 was best - I'm sure Adam was already looking to Game 4.
