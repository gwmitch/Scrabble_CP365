#note (JD) I like getting to play new people! That said, I felt awful throughout this game.
>JD: LNNOSTU H5 LUN.T +5 5
#note the sim results here are non-intuitive to me. I thought this was a reasonable choice to create an S hook, but quackle hates it due to its poor defense. the best plays actually keep the U - NOT or TON overlapping really limit his scoring potential next turn in spite of the wretched leave. they also score more.
>Matt_Tunnicliffe: ADHIRRU 5E HUR. +14 46
>JD: NORSTVY I2 TROY +19 24
#note this is a definite error. I fixated on the back-hook and forgot about THURL. STONY/THURL is far and away best and would've prevented the subsequent bingo.

>Matt_Tunnicliffe: ?DGMNOS 1F MOGS +29 149
#note DONGS is a little better

>JD: AAGISTU G8 .UGA +12 105
#note TAU is SO MUCH BETTER than this play! I'm very disappointed that I didn't see it.

>JD: ADFGIST A12 .AFT +30 135
#note my winning chances are minuscule already. perhaps cutting my losses with FIDGETS is preferable.
>Matt_Tunnicliffe: AEJRSTX B11 J.TE +34 297
#note JARLS is points. Decided to kill the T? Doesn't matter too much either way at this score.

#note Tsk. I wasn't 100% on RINSIBLE and didn't need to take a chance on anything I wasn't positive of.

#note I should probably play safer here. He's ~19% to bingo.
>JD: CCDEESU 15E SUCCEED +94 360
#note now I mercifully go to go take a break. I was not feeling good at all. I only screwed up a few moves at the beginning, but sharper play would've made a big difference. At least now I would get to begin my swiss gambit.
