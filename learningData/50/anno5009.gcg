#note this is a serious strategic mistake. i spent a very long time on this move and put a star next to it on my scoresheet, cuz i had no idea what to do. i think that from now on i'll know what to do in this type of situation. J1 SCUP is significantly better than my move, especially with this score. you live you learn. if i'm going to play at G, VICE is better than PUCE. not exactly sure why, since CISV seems better than CPSU to me. but scup has to be best. as far as puce vs vice, it seems puce will give back more bingos and vice will net ME more bingos. sure enough, CUPES??? makes 88 bingos and VICES??? makes 73! surprising.
