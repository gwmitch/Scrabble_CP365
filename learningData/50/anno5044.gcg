#note The star play here is GAWKIER. I guess it's hard for me to anagram stuff like that. Probably need more anagramming practice. (-11)

>Cesar: ABEGIIT E11 BAIT +26 50
#note I'm curious as to why BIG is SO much better than my play. Of course I saw it, but I just said EGI > AEIT and the points are the same, and just play aggressive and don't worry about opening the S hook. Is this so wrong? (-4.5) But it turns out BIG bingos much more often than BAIT (even though the average score is lower!) and BAIT gives back more than 6 points more than BIG. I guess a little defense is called for sometimes.

#note This sucks but at least I only gave up two additional points.

#note i found the winningest play here, but i already knew i wasn't going to draw what i needed. it's only a 20% shot to win anyway though.. i was thinking something like EPSILON/PINOLES.

#note it was very annoying to draw UV out of the bag but then i saw i still had a couple bingos that didn't play. oh well. -9 K3 COVIN to block his J play.
