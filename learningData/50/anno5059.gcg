#note Didn't know PUTTIE; but I was right that PEWIT is better than PUTTI (-1)

>E._Tran: ?ENRTUU 10E UN.ERcUT +60 86
#note PURULENT, PUNCTURE, and UPTURNED are the better bingoes.  Definitely would've like UPTURNED.  (-10)
>Juraj_P.: AAGGNST M6 GANGSTA +71 81
#note He thought he was phoneying here; I laughed, knowing this stupid word was good
>E._Tran: EIOPTUW K5 WIPEO.T +48 134
#note Strange that I would have a natural, but it plays in two places only as a non-bingo x2x2.
>Juraj_P.: EIJV L2 JIVE +33 114
>E._Tran: EEMTTUV H10 .MEUTE +27 161
#note I laid EMU J5 first; but decided that GANGSTA hook and DLS was worthy of blocking.  Sim says it's close.

>Juraj_P.: ACDENOO --  -76 114
#note Juraj often tries silly high probability phoneys like these.

>E._Tran: EFIIOQZ L12 FIZ +40 277
#note FIQ(U)E is smarter; saves the Z to cash in for next turn. (-6)
>Juraj_P.: ANOYY N12 YAY +27 177
>E._Tran: ?BEIOQX O13 BOX +45 322
#note Interesting position.  Obvious play is OX J5.  But that O line looks really dangerous.  Seems worth the 11 pt sacrifice to play BOX; plus, I get to dump the B.  Again, sim is inconsistent and flipfloppy
>Juraj_P.: ACNORSU 14B COURAN.S +74 251
#note Turns out I block nothing.  Maybe defense is overrated.

>E._Tran: ?AEIILR 8M .IL +9 361
#note No bingoes.  Nothing jumps out as a great play.  9B ILIA is kinda cute with no C's or M's left.  My play kinda sucks, but at least prevents any x3 bingoes on the O-line.
