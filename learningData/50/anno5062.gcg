#note I forgot just how awkward a lot of my racks were in this tournament.  At least she can't do much on this board.

#note Kate might have misread this rack, since KIF would obviously be better.  But she has no A on the next rack.

#note Well, when things aren't meant to be, they really aren't meant to be.  If I don't play SIZY, she can Z-stick me unless I play UNWIT A13 to threaten YUTZ.  But she can kill that spot with PAUSE, conveniently saving herself EOO for OOZE when I eventually play SIZY.  Blah.

#note The saddest part of this game is that I led after every one of my turns and still lost.  I'm just glad this wasn't the deciding game of a finals.
