#note I like the play personally. Quackle likes GLORY and GORY equally, which is a little funny. My second pick was LEERY just because of the rating of your opponent.

#note Best. 
>Gloriosa: CHLOPTY 14F ZI.I +33 100
>Zar: AFILPRS 11H ..RF +18 101
#note Probably best but FLASH 15D is an interesting idea. What's to say they can always outplay you on a closed board? 
>Gloriosa: CHLOPTY J5 ADO +17 117
>Zar: AGILPSW 13C PAW +28 129
#note Good enough play, though the 4 extra for PILAW is worth considering. I might play GAWP 5I if I am really gunning for bingos.

#note Well, even after this you're in trouble (17.5%? geesh). 
>Gloriosa: DMNNOTV 4B MIN.E +18 295
>Zar: DLNNOPT 4K .LO.P +24 291
#note BLOOP is one of your better plays, though the super-cute DELETION F3 I think is far better due to you drawing tiles. One of your better hopes is to draw an E, play EQUITE* and see if you get away with it. That, or to play something really bad sounding like NIDUP*.
>Gloriosa: EKNOOTV 3A YOKE +40 335
>Zar: ?ADNNTT 9H T.N +5 296
#note I don't trust the sim results for this one. DENE F3 sims best (I suppose for drawing bingos) and exch ADNTT is second. I would've though exch ADNNT is a LOT stronger even because you have the chance of drawing OUTDRIVEN (which, even if it's bad, has a good chance of being let go). At this point, I might play a 4-letter phony ilke NATH* 15E because it's something I personally wasn't 100% sure was bad and thus since you're playing it I doubt it'd be contested.
