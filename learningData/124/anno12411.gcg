>Ryan_Fischer: AAENRST J8 SANTERA +68 68
#note I think Gibson might play TSARE(V)NA instead.  Hard to say.  I was a bit careless opening that S-hook but didn't think it'd be that bad.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?DHIINS 15D HIDINgS +100 112
#note Ow.  (Held and released.)
>Ryan_Fischer: AGILOOV 14B VIOLA +32 100
#note OVOLI is even better.  Oops.
>Matthew_Bernardina: FOOW K9 WOOF +36 148
>Ryan_Fischer: BEGHIOS L12 SIGH +36 136
#note Dammit, he blocked GOBSHITE natural for like 100,000 (okay, 106).  Play BOSH instead of SIGH.  B(EF)OG is another option.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ALY 15L .YLA +30 178
>Ryan_Fischer: BEELOOZ L5 BOOZE +32 168
#note Champ agrees.  It's the best of some not very good options.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EIN 8L .EIN +39 217
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEILOU M2 LOUIE +16 184
#note Was at least hoping he'd play ZING or ZAGS and give me an out for this mess.  The auto-play for a rack like this very rarely helps me out as much as I'd like.  Sigh.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AKW 2K WA.K +22 239
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEPRRU 13F RUE +8 192
#note Quackle always illuminates leaves I don't think of as being as good as they really are.  UREA leaving PER is just fine.  Stops up that triple line and gives me some new life.  This play just barely ranks.
>Matthew_Bernardina: Q C13 Q. +22 261
>Ryan_Fischer: AEPRRRU 5J RU..ER +16 208
#note Even more Rs.  Ugh.  This is 3rd.  PARRE(L) or BOOZER, apparently.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ETT 12D TET +11 272
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFIPR N10 FECIA. +38 246
#note 2nd to RECAP for 48.  Couldn't quite put that together.
>Matthew_Bernardina: IMN 11C NIM +20 292
>Ryan_Fischer: DDENOPR 1G PEDRO +29 275
#note Dump the D for 22 off BOOZE, says Q.  Yeah, whatever the case, not leaving myself with a vowel really messed me up here.  Down as I am, in need of a bingo, or at least points.  PEDRO is 3rd, can't really fault it, but it leaves a bit too much to luck.  DOPED, leaving NR, or ROPED, across Matthew's play, is another option.  Either leaves a lot to luck.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AGMN 3I MANG. +20 312
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DDJNTY 6K T..D +18 293
#note This is 2nd to BOOZED.  Only two viable choices.  This mess is why I should've left a vowel.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABCEP 10D BECAP +27 339
#note Great play he made, preventing any big scoring opportunities I might have had with the J or X.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEJNXY 2C JiNXED +43 336
#note D(E)X gives me a 5% chance of drawing JITNEYS, which I saw, but didn't see going down (and apparently some other words which do).  I just figured I couldn't rely on a J bingo.  I was wrong.  And this play was definitely jinxing.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEIORST C2 .AROSITE +84 423
#note LOL.  Even Matthew's wife saw this.  That's a third bingo with a power tile, the second through one already on the board.
