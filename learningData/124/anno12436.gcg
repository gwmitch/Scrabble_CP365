#note MT: Considered tacking UN in front. Didn't seem worth the risk.
>Ross_Brown: AAFGSTW 11B WAFTAG.S +80 160
#note Ross decides to block the double-double line and sacrifice a few points.  Quackle agrees.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?BNOTUX 6D BOX +33 167
#note MT: Not crazy about what this gives up, but don't see anything else worth doing.
>Ross_Brown: AELNSUV 5E NAEVUS +31 191
#note A good bingo to miss: 10H (J)UVENALS +80 would have set up a triple-triple for Matthew.

#note It's a tossup between this and 10C MEEK +47.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAIRRST 10H .AR +14 315
#note MT: The board is obviously not fantastic for bingos, but I have some good shots. Lots of E's to give me a SATIRE rack. I considered both 12C RAI and 1C KRAITS for their scoring and defense, but decided neither was the edge I needed in this shootout. The sim says this is a 7 point error behind AIR.
>Ross_Brown: EEGIMNN 1C .EENING +39 350
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AIRRST K7 ARTSIeR +73 388
#note MT: In my mind's eye, this word fit from K6 to K13, which it obviously didn't. I though it was more defensive that RISTRAs because it forced him to play parallel to two tiles to bingo down the L column, but obviously it doesn't. Probably a minor error, since a bingo is only one of many probable ways I can lose. Still stupid.
#note RB: Matthew blocks Ross's 14E TAP(E)WORM +79.

#note Keeping lots of options open on row 3.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ELLOPST 13B PET +30 479
#note I couldn't make up my mind whether I was more likely to lose to a bingo or a big parallel under FORA. POLLS 3G blocks the bingo lanes and puts me up 50. That is probably good enough to outrun stuff like 13B PETTY or 4K HEAVY, but not guaranteed. CRYPTO would hurt. PET puts me up 58, and almost certainly loses to any of the possible bingos. (There aren't many.) I dunno. The sim does prefer PET to POLLS.... by a lot... but I can't say I'm sure why. POLLS still seems to make a lot of sense. 3G POL wins the sim.
