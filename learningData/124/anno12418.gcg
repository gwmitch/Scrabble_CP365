#note This was a tough call. I made a point of not opening easy bingo lanes, so it seemed silly to start fishing now. I could try to hit something like (R)EGRATES, but that just seemed destined to throw the game away. GA(Y) wins in the sim, but (DO)G, (JAM)S and my STAGE play are all pretty close.

#note Ok so I guess I'm fishing now. But this opens duel lanes and and bingo chances seem pretty high. However PU(R)I would have made more sense. 13I PAISE scores 36, but I didn't know it.

#note I actually wasn't completely sure URP took an S after I thought about it. I thought it was something like UGH. Whoa, you mean UGH takes an S too? That's too funny. I missed (E)ATERIES.

#note I lost 10 points.I was so glad I won this game though, I marathoned through work all weekend while playing in this tournament at the same time. Never again. I was practically falling asleep at this point. I mean, I didn't do very good, but going 5-9 would have been horrific.
