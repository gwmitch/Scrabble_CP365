#note Shit. I had thought about the plural of CIMEX when I played it, and concluded that I remembered CIMEXES* better than CIMICES. So I didn't hold when it came around.

#note I don't really know what to keep here, or how to adjust the leave to this board. Keeping the C or P just didn't look that great on this board, given the possibilities. I'm not sure how to analyze this position.
