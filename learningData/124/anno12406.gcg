>Rahn_McKeown: AAH 8H AHA +12 12
>Ryan_Fischer: ABFIPRS 7H FAB +24 24
>Rahn_McKeown: AIR 9H RAI +22 34
>Rahn_McKeown: AIR --  -22 12
#note I guess he meant to play RIA.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IPRSTU 9F PeRITUS +77 101
#note STIRRUP and DISRUPT give back a bit too much.  This is fine, though in hindsight I wish I wasn't playing things so tight versus Rahn.
>Rahn_McKeown: AEIRU 8L UREA +18 30
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILLTY L7 L..TILY +20 121
#note 10E YILL 23, I guess.  This doesn't even show up.  Dumb play.
>Rahn_McKeown: AEEIRSY 12H YEAR.IES +66 96
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEITX 13H EX +39 160
#note Yeah, AXE is better.
>Rahn_McKeown: ENQU N10 QU.EN +68 164
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEIRT J6 A...E +11 171
#note 11E EATER 26?  ABATE doesn't really help as much as I thought, and of course, EEIRT isn't great.  I don't know how else to play this, though.
>Rahn_McKeown: HOT O12 .HOT +28 192
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGIRT 11E TIGER +28 199
#note If this, then GAITER is much better.  TIGER is 4th, but it really messes up the board, killing two lines, making a third harder to hit.
>Rahn_McKeown: INZ 14F ZIN +39 231
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEFLOR 15A FEDORA +44 243
#note No FREELOAD, or any other of the like 7 8s that are here, and I blocked ALFREDO from going down.  FEDORA is technically right, but it just crushes me what happens next.
>Rahn_McKeown: OTW 14B WOT +27 258
>Ryan_Fischer: JLMMPTW -JLMMPW +0 243
#note Keep LT?  I chose just T.
>Rahn_McKeown: EGL 13A LEG +24 282
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACNTVV 12D VAT +16 259
#note V(A)V is out of the question because it kills column N.  Anyone disagree?  I think xVV is just a bit better than VAT in hindsight, though I thought I needed to score something to keep up.
>Rahn_McKeown: DS G13 D.S +30 312
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BCINNV -BNV +0 259
#note Really?  Can't make a scoring play 'cause it kills that line.
>Rahn_McKeown: ENOP K11 P.ONE +27 339
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CIINUW -IUW +0 259
#note Scrabble nightmare.  Though, I guess, WIN is plausible.  Only 14 points, though, and easily blocked.
>Rahn_McKeown: GLO O6 GO.L +5 344
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEIMNN K4 NIM +14 273
#note MINCE or NIM, hard to say which is better, but I needed to buy time and not break the rack up as much, I figured.
>Rahn_McKeown: EIIRV 4I VI.IER +18 362
#note And of course he has the V now.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEKNOO N2 CO.K +20 293
#note COKE/ETA opens up another line, but blocks the hard-to-hit L.  This leaves it.
>Rahn_McKeown: CM 3M M.C +22 384
#note I think that's all she wrote.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENOOSW F8 O. +4 297
#note Champ says NEWEST down low, and that fishing to set up another line isn't worth it.  Okay.  Maybe he goofs.  Note that I've scored 54 points over the last 7 turns.  Brilliant.
>Rahn_McKeown: ABDIJNU E5 DJIN +26 410
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DENOSW A6 DOWNSEl. +83 380
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DENOSW --  -83 297
#note Worth a shot.
>Rahn_McKeown: ABU 6E .UBA +22 432
#note Nice little out sequence.
>Rahn_McKeown:  (DENOSW?) +20 452
>Ryan_Fischer: (time) -30 267
