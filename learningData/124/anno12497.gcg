#note i didn't see or think of HOOT. at 1-4 i wasn't in a very good mood anyway. yawn. (-3) would this little mistake cost me the game? probably, in this tournament.

#note so i have to do EXIT. i can't do J5 OXY, 2F BRIO is ridiculous. EDITRIX is really cool, though. quackle likes 15A RIOT too which i didn't really think of, but i hate EXIT because in this tournament it will cost me. i should play knowing i'm gonna get the worst case scenario because maybe i can use that to my advantage.

#note ok, now the rest of this game has another dynamic. why did i think i would draw what i need? there's a couple of things i can do here. first of all, COX/FOX take out a big scoring threat at the expense of pretty damn bad leaves. JAM just simplifies things. then there's FICO/FIDO/FIORD which all go for TAJ/RAJ an aren't that bad anyway. equity-wise, quackle likes FIORD and FICO just behind it, but bad-drawing wise, i should just play JAM or FOX and get it over with.

#note of course a 15-pt equity loss gets me a loss in this tournament, along with the ~15 in the Lester game (right before the game became unwinnable when i started playing badly and bled some more). leesa bingoed 4 times in the first 6 turns against me and peter had 360 pts after 5 turns, so the only other game is the one against doug. if i also lost 15 equity points in that one, i'll quit scrabble.
