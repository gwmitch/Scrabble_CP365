#note A lot of close options here. I wanted to make a play that opened the right side of the board, but I don't think this is the best option. I can't play TAG under HELIOS because a parallel play on the triple shuts down the board pretty bad. Maybe OUTRIG? AGOUTI? TURGITE? RAG over NAWAB scores best but the leave is ugly. Quackle prefers TURGITE for what it's worth.

#note This is a pretty paranoid play. I put Gibson on a strong rack after EON, and decided to block his best bingo lane. My thinking was that I'd force him to fish again, or bust open the board with a bingo of his own. The only good board opening option I saw was INVAR, which I hated (NW is pretty weak), but (ALE)VIN (which I missed) stands out as a play that could get me back into the game. If I'm certain Gibson has a blank, VIAND is actually a good play, but with any notion of doubt I have to play ALEVIN.

#note CROUP - thought it might only be with an E (TROUP* is the phoney)

#note Opening an X spot for the X he doesn't have. Unfortunately I'm scoring nothing and opening an S hook. The play here is clearly UPO/OBE, setting up an even better X spot and scoring halfway decently. I can also get MURA with an M draw. So yeah, this play sucks.

#note There's situations in which this spot can't be dealt with if the S is in the bag. It's still an extreme longshot to win though.
