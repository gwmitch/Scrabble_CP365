>Juraj_Pivovarov: CIILMNY 8C MYCILIN +86 86
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CIILMNY --  -86 0
#note I had no idea whether this was valid or not -  it was way out of my range. But Juraj has played phony bingos on me before so I kind of just went with my gut reaction.
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEEGOZ H8 DOZED +36 36
#note Knowing his rack, I saw that parallel plays like MIC or YIN would score a little less using this placement. But I helped him so this is a bad play. If I know that he can bingo with the letter E, I'm probably better off to exchange?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CIILMNY 11F MY.LINIC +80 80
#note Now I figured he phonied knowing there was a good chance I might play an E. But If I had been sharper I would have sensed playing DOZED was a bad idea.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHLNS L6 LEASH.NG +76 112
#note Or SHEAL(I)NG.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EFILORU 8B FLUORI.E +63 143
>Matthew_Larocque: AEKNORS 10H .EK +44 156
#note Good but not good enough, I missed (F)ORSAKEN for 84 points.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AAEINPT 12A PATINAE. +87 230
#note Yikes.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGNORS -  +0 156
#note I didn't know the word, and saw that I had multiple bingo options. But regardless, this didn't seem like the type of word he'd have just made up. Should have just played my bingo to stay in the game.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIJSSUV J6 JUS +39 269
#note I deserved this - If I just play ANGORAS without making a needless and poorly thought out challenge, he doesn't get to make this play. He noted that he had the unplayable bingo JUSSIVE.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGNORS C3 GRANO.AS +72 228
#note M1 ANGORAS sets up some crazy stuff, which might be required when you're 2 bingos behind.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIOV 13J VO.IE +18 287
>Matthew_Larocque: CGORTTW G6 TW.G +19 247
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IQ F5 QI +17 304
>Matthew_Larocque: CEORTUX 14N XU +36 283
#note I thought I was killing the best bingo lane - Didn't realise VOGIE was an adjective like TAWIE and DOWIE. A10 EX(P)ORT sims a little better though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BDW B11 B.WD +20 324
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEORTU A12 .OET +26 309
#note 1 bingo plays, a common word too, too fixated on OUTRACE.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EE 3C .EE +4 328
#note Juraj you better not bingo again...!
>Matthew_Larocque: ACNRRUV 4A CU.R +22 331
#note UN(LEASHING) is the highest scorer. I didn't know the word CURRAN, which plays at M2.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?AEEHMT M2 METHAnE +77 405
#note B1 HEA(U)ME is a cool fit if he didn't have bingos.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFNPRV 2K VA.P +22 353
#note Hey, maybe I will draw the Y?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?AEINOR 4G sENORI.A +66 471
#note >_<
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIILNR A1 FLI. +27 380
#note N2 (P)L(A)ID looks much cooler then my play, I could go out in style at least.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ABOORST O1 OS +18 489
#note He missed a lot of high scoring plays, and there's nothing I can do with VAMPY.
>Matthew_Larocque: DINRTY H1 TYN.D +27 407
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ABORT 2F BO. +14 503
#note ABO(s) in that spot is better, along with 13D TORA.
>Matthew_Larocque: IR F11 ..IR +8 415
#note N4 (A)IR.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ART) +6 421
#note Even though I didn't get blown out, I still played pretty badly. I feel like I shouldn't have missed (F)ORSAKEN or E(D)UCATOR since they are common words, and challenging PATINAE(D) was even worse. I even felt like I was going to be wrong as I made the walk.
