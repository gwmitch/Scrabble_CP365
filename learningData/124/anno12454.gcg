>Ryan_Fischer: AAEHMNR 8D HERMA +28 28
#note Was so tempted to play some sort of phony to get him to give me the E I need for HERMAEAN, but it's not a good gambit.
>Steve_Bush: BPU 7C PUB +19 19
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNOW 9G OWN +18 46
#note I forgot the I hook to HERMA -- thought just E.  No S.  WINO looks okay if you aren't scared of the X.  This is vowel heavy, but okay.
>Steve_Bush: IITT 7H TITI +11 30
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEILNN E7 ..ELINE +18 64
#note K5 ANILINE 28.  Still can't find non-bingo 2x2s.
>Steve_Bush: AII 12D I.IA +8 38
>Ryan_Fischer: AABELNZ K2 BANAL.ZE +88 152
#note Of note: 6J ABLAZE 47.
>Steve_Bush: OSU 10K SOU +23 61
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EJNRTT M9 J.T +18 170
#note Block the Z.
>Steve_Bush: AEO 6J A.OE +10 71
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EENRTT 13G TENTERs +69 239
#note This is the best defensive option.  Others score more but slot the triple.  ENfETTER is one that doesn't.  Hard to see, that.
>Steve_Bush: FIQR 3J F.QIR +34 105
>Ryan_Fischer: DEHORTW 12K HOED +36 275
#note 12K DOETH 44.  Whoops.  This is of course better defensively.
>Steve_Bush: DIKS O1 DISK +60 165
>Ryan_Fischer: FNORTWY 5J W.NY +23 298
#note I doubted FAWNY.  I couldn't remember what word like that either wasn't valid or didn't compare.
>Steve_Bush: DIV 13B VID. +19 184
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGLORT 10C GO.F +16 314
#note FROGLET no go.  Plays through the V, while appealing, are a bad idea.  Save spread by killing that section of the board instead.  GOLF makes it less lucrative to play through the V, and I'll probably have something to respond with if he does.
>Steve_Bush: ELO B11 LO.E +14 198
>Ryan_Fischer: ACELRTV 15A CRAVE +50 364
>Steve_Bush: RS K12 ..RS +7 205
#note Ballsy.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADLNOTU 15K .OUND +21 385
#note Was gonna play UNLOAD but now I can't lest I risk losing a lot of spread.  Sure he has to hit pretty perfectly to play through the S, but crazier things have happened.
>Steve_Bush: GY C5 GY. +9 214
>Ryan_Fischer: ACELPTX A7 CAPLET +38 423
#note No idea why I couldn't/didn't take the time to bother to/ find EXPAT for 50.  Lazy.  CAPLET/PLACET.
>Steve_Bush: ?EIORSU 5C .UIRO +12 226
#note N6 SUdOR 30.  Of note 15H mIS(SOUND) 24.
