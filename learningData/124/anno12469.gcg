>Richard_Charach: ACUY 8E YUCA +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEKRU E8 .AUK +22 22
#note Yes, my first play is a phony 4....>_> I figured there was a good chance Richard wouldn't challenge.
>Richard_Charach: FMU 7H FUM +14 32
>Richard_Charach: FMU --  -14 18
#note Not to be outdone....
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEFNRT 10D F.D +11 33
#note Heh, this rack doesn't make any 8 letter words.
>Richard_Charach: FMU H8 .MU +5 23
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNRTY I9 ANY +14 47
#note Didn't know YAMUN.
>Richard_Charach: AFRT J6 FART +20 43
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENPRTX K4 PREX +40 87
>Richard_Charach: IV 9C VI. +15 58
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HNOQTV 4I QO.H +36 123
#note Wow, that P was a godsend. 
>Richard_Charach: IRS M4 SRI +22 80
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ALNTVW 11I .AWL +20 143
#note I could also just play W(AX). Sim likes K9 TAV as well, but I figured the V was a little better for bingos than W.
>Richard_Charach: EJO L9 JO.E +22 102
>Matthew_Larocque: ?INRTVW 7I W.. +17 160
#note Nice. :/
>Richard_Charach: EEIMRST 13F RETIMES +73 175
#note MEISTER makes 86, but I could understand that seeming risky when I just played off one letter.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HINRTV 14A THRIVeN +77 237
#note I'm not sure why I didn't play at the N6 spot, even though I'm opening 2 triples this could backfire really badly.
>Richard_Charach: BEI A12 BI.E +27 202
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNNNOS M8 IONS +28 265
#note Haha, I wasn't even sure YAWL took an S. I always think of y'all. NIL 14I is the preferred play in the sim. Yeah, I definitely should have blocked that TWS posthaste. If he does bingo there, I'm going to be in a world of hurt.
>Richard_Charach: ADDEPR 15G DRAPED +40 242
#note But I luck out of my error.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABGLNNU D12 GL.B +20 285
#note There's a lot of vowels left so I agree that (B)UNG or (B)LUB/(B)ULB are much better.
>Richard_Charach: IIIOU -IIIOU +0 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AANNOU 11E .OA +10 295
#note Suprisingly exchanges rank really high here. I might have seen UNA(U), I think I favoured the more closed option of (K)OA.
>Richard_Charach: EGN N7 ENG +17 259
#note !
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGINNU O2 GUANINs +82 377
#note I'm not going to lie, I was only like 60% sure this was a word. But the faint recognition meant I must have seen it before somewhere.
>Richard_Charach: OZ -  +0 259
#note Sigh of relief.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILOOT 5F LOTI +15 392
#note TELOI in the same spot. Or just keep the board dead and dink off letters somewhere.
>Richard_Charach: OZ J2 ZO. +32 291
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELOT 4D TOED +15 407
#note Running out of time.... longer plays such as ELATED, DELATE and ELODEA rank best sim-wise. With DELATE though, there's a good chance he'd have COE(D)IT/S.
>Richard_Charach: CEEIOST 6B COTES +20 311
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEL 2H LA.E +13 420
#note Apparently we left a letter in the bag and didn't notice..... this has happened a few times now.
#note 311-405 was the recorded score.
