#note Missed the SLANDERS hook. Thought of BARDIEST#, but no real studying = definite uncertainty.

#note MANGY seemed to give him a chance to double double, potentially big, and get back into it. Besides that, plenty of I's out for QIN/QIS. CYME is best here, in my opinion. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Adam Logan for not correcting my error when announcing this as 42.

#note GILGAI# looks neat.
>Adam: ?ABEORZ D2 ZEBRAnO +90 335
#note Champ likes him playing BEZOARs here.
>Me: EIIILOT K1 IOLITE +14 382
#note This rack was a real mindfuck# If I play for the points at 1B, he can easily have a huge play there. I really didn't know what to do.
>Adam: ?DPSX 1G SPaD.X +69 404
>Me: HIJNOUY 2B JI. +38 420
#note WOOT! totally awesome play here. Sets up honey and leaves the hard to block HOY. BUNJY# also wins, but this is best.
>Adam: AGISVW 15I WIG +16 420
#note I'm wondering if he missed UNHO(L)Y here. I certainly did. Perhaps he's banking on that though.
>Me: HNOUY 3A HON.Y +35 455
>Adam: ASV N13 SAV +21 441
#note He missed VA(NE)S G8 for 28. With the actual score, I would still win by 3 points. Close shave. Actual final recorded as 453 - 443.
