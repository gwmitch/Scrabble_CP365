#note Not going to block a lane with PURI or spend my S with PIOUS, so fishing it is.
>Robb_Griffith: AF I3 FA +20 254
>Ryan_Fischer: HIJOPRS 9E JOSH +31 230
#note Though I was loath to do this, I had to take the points.  Only play that makes any sense, despite the X threat.
>Robb_Griffith: AAELOTV 11A IDOLATE +68 322
>Robb_Griffith: AAELOTV --  -68 254
#note Little break here.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEIOPRX 10D POX +62 292
#note Of COURSE BOX is a better play than POX.  PIER is so potent.  But I couldn't resist the inkling that "what if I don't draw a bingo?"  Then, at least, I'll have the B to underlap and make JOB.  So, that's why I played POX.
>Robb_Griffith: ADEILOT 11E TOED +45 299
#note Plus, I forgot to mention, he said he was about to play IDOLATER instead.  It played in two places.  So I was so surprised he didn't try.  If he played it up top, I'd have a bingo response.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEINRST H11 ..B +6 298
#note And of course, if I keep the P, I have PTERINS.  Best laid plans and all.  P > B.  Of course P > B.

#note FI(R) will KV stick him if he plays CR(Y).  I was more focused on finding an out in two because I mistracked and had him with a vowel out.
