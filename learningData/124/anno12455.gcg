#note Held and released.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGNNPT H6 P..NT +7 23
#note No bingos.  PHEW.  A play like PING is just ASKING the board to be closed, so that's why I played PAINT, hoping to hit next turn.
>Marc_Broering: AAELR N5 AER.AL +10 72
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGHNO M8 .HEOGENy +91 114
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGHNO --  -91 23
#note NO bingos.  Damn.  I saw GEOPHONE and HEGEMON and they wouldn't go down.  There's probably some other fancy stuff too. -- just PHOSGENE and HYPOGENE.  Wow.  I figured I'd test the waters and make something up that sounded plausible.  Bad idea, when I had HENGE sitting there for 35.
>Marc_Broering: ADEILR O1 RAILED +29 101
#note Giving me the R too a gut check.

#note You're effin' kidding me?
>Marc_Broering: ENY 11H YEN +17 118
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIKNOZ 10F ZI. +32 85
#note TOKENIZE* is no good.  No go.  Missing ZIP was a horrible whiff.  I could get 68 now for ZOEcI(A).  Whoops.
>Marc_Broering: AX N2 AX +31 149
#note That hurts.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACEKNO L8 .AKEN +24 109
#note Gotta risk opening sometime.  11E KA 23 looks good.
>Marc_Broering: SW I10 S.W +19 168
#note He doesn't seem to be afraid to open either.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BCILOT F10 .OIC +15 124
#note K11 TIC 28.  Good board vision, Quackle.
>Marc_Broering: BCR 12D CR.B +16 184
#note Well, this at least gives me a line.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BILLTU M11 LUB +14 138
#note No TULLIBEE or BULLETIN.  BULLIEST or BULLSHIT.  Heh.  I figured it's time to make up a 3, see if he's on his toes.  Still missing YENTE.
>Marc_Broering: ?EEIMRT 14I TRIrEME +76 260
#note Whoops.  (dIMETER is 84)

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEGPS 4C SPA.GlED +72 273
#note Best is 4C mED(I)GAPS 82.  Only 10 pts difference to find something REALLY hard with a blank.  And the only other bingo is MISPAGED.
>Marc_Broering: EHIV 3I HIVE +26 341
#note Misscored as 27.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDEGNO C2 DO.AGE +18 291
#note I don't know why I didn't play DONGA/AZOIC.  Was too low on time to track.
