>Ryan_Fischer: EHIOTTY 8D HOTTY +30 30
#note HOTTY is bogus, apparently.  It's HOTTIE.
>John_Price: EFLU 7B FUEL +15 15
#note Well, that did a good job of obstructing my bingo options.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EINRUV G1 VIRUlEN. +62 92
#note VENTURIS is the only other/better.

>John_Price: CNZ 4I Z.NC +30 187
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEEGGO 2A GAB +16 261
#note I took a long time here, too.  Saw (PAWN)AGE almost immediately but didn't want to chance getting smacked hard as I likely would.  GAB doesn't rank.  I played it to keep the O for a play under the J.
>John_Price: CMRR 6F M.RC.R +16 203
#note Held and released, nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGNORU 12F ERUGO +16 277

>John_Price: HILT 4A HILT +31 264
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AINOQR H11 Q.OIN +42 354
#note Biggest score, but the risk of a bingo coming back down.  Wouldn't hurt too much, but is a spread consideration.
>John_Price: EFM 11D FEM +20 284
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAIKRS D11 .A +10 364
#note Ooh, fishing off the A at B7 is clever.  Fortunately I didn't miss anything sexy here.
