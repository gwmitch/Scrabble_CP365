#note Bleh, guess I should've gone for more points with PEW.

#note Took me a while, was happy to find this.  These racks are the WORST.
>Marc_Broering: JNU B13 JUN +40 181
#note Was worried about that, but it didn't seem to be too big of a concern.  Just can't seem to connect.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIKNTY 2I KY.NITE +44 213
#note Dammit, I just could've played YAK for 39.  Too excited with the flashy play.
>Marc_Broering: ?AGILOR O1 s.RAGLIO +131 312
#note Ow.  REGIONAL and GERANIOL too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELRST 4F REDTA.LS +72 285
#note I took REDTAILS to leave N open and open two lines on rows 3 and 5.
>Marc_Broering: EF 10B FE. +33 345
#note Another reason I should've played PEW earlier.
>Ryan_Fischer: AELRSUU -UU +0 285
#note Totally missed the spot for ULU(s) which would've saved me so much trouble.
>Marc_Broering: OY A14 YO +29 374
>Ryan_Fischer: AELORSZ F2 ZE.O +33 318
#note Hate killing those lanes but it seems best.
>Marc_Broering: ADEEOVW M4 .EMIAVER +68 442
>Marc_Broering: ADEEOVW --  -68 374
#note Okay.  SEMI(QU)AVER.  Hehe.  Closest thing I can find is SEMIARID or SEMIOVAL.
>Ryan_Fischer: AALORST 14H ALASTOR +70 388
>Marc_Broering: AEEIMRV 13K AIMER +28 402
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EHIPUU -  +0 388
#note So I went into the tank for a long time here, holding on this.  I kept thinking, it's IMAGINER/MIGRAINE, not REAIMING*.  One who aims... is an AIMER?  I figured I needed these lanes and him not to score to win.  Plus, I needed to win by 54 to win $70.  Challenging is of course wrong.  I got really lucky with how things shook out, not to say there wasn't thought in it.  There were things I could hit if I played HUE at E5, but it wasn't likely.  I wasn't thinking too much from the S until after I fished off one U.  This was dictated solely by how many tiles he played.
>Marc_Broering: EEVW 15M WEE +29 431
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EHIPUU L1 U. +3 391
#note Champ likes fishing off the U, too.  Wrong place, though.
>Marc_Broering: CIORTVV 5B VICT.R +24 455
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEHIPU M4 .UlPHIDE +67 458
#note VICTOR gave me EVICTOR, too.  PUSHED, PIGHED, and PISHED all lose by a couple thanks to my overtime, though.  My finding this was total luck.  Win the game by bingoing out, yet still lose the tourney.  Such is the craziness of the short-form tourney.  I'm fine with it, though.  Happy to get one in on Marc and get a little ratings boost.
