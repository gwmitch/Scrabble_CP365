>Becky: EIINOZ -II +0 0
#note She mentioned that she kept ZONE and another letter, forget what the actual exchange was.  
>Matt: CDEGIIU 8D GUIDE +18 18
#note Even assuming a really good rack, I think I need to dump the junk with this play.  Maybe exchange GIU?
>Becky: ENZ F6 ZE.N +33 33
>Matt: ?ACIILW 6D WI. +15 33
>Becky: BHOO 5B BOOH +33 66
>Matt: ?AACILU H1 AcICULA. +86 119
#note I was happy with finding this particular play.  
>Becky: ?ENOQTU 1H .QUaTONE +101 167
#note Geez that's just bad lucky I think. 
>Matt: AILNNNR 5H .NNAIL +12 131
#note So focused on dumping as many of the consonants as possible, especially with the triple N draw, I missed plays that actually scored well.  NAIN#, NARIC, even NAN is fine.
>Becky: HM 4C HM +35 202
>Matt: ANOPRRW 2J PROW +33 164
#note Right idea, but PROWAR is a word and scores 58!  
>Becky: EFN 3K FEN +32 234
>Matt: AJLNORV 3B JO +30 194
#note JOR# perhaps.  Throwing the J in that lane is not terribly dangerous and I need to shed another consonant here. 
>Becky: AELV D8 .AVEL +18 252
>Matt: AILNORV 11B OV.RLAIN +72 266
#note Forgot NONRIVAL.  It plays for 4 more with a pretty underlap.
>Becky: DEIKR H10 D.KIER +48 300
#note I did get punished for non-optimal plays this game.
>Matt: DDEFRTU B10 F.RDED +38 304
#note With all those Ts unseen, perhaps FORTED#.  Wasn't sure of it of course.
>Becky: AACEEIT 15D ACIE.ATE +61 361
#note At this point I'm wondering where all the S's are.  Was not expecting a bingo without an S to come down.
>Matt: EGIOOTU A8 GIO +17 321
#note Saw PREGUIDE but forgot about OUTGUIDE.  That keeps things much closer, as does OUTGO.  
>Becky: MTX 13G M.XT +24 385
#note I think she had 7 consonants here.
>Matt: EGOPRTU B5 .UG +8 329
#note I figure I have to draw an S next turn, so dumping UG seemed most likely to bingo next turn.  It's probably not going to be enough though.
>Becky: AY 6H .AY +29 414
>Matt: EIOPRST K7 RIPOSTE +82 411
#note Shoulda played PROSTIE instead, but she would have had enough time to find BREAST 8J for the win.
>Becky: ABERSTT 8J B.TTER +27 441
>Matt: ESSY 12J S.YES +18 429
#note Missing PROWAR and OUTGUIDE, plus the UNNAIL turn were killers.
>Matt:  (SA) +4 433
