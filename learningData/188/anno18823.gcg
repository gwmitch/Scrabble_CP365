#note I felt like my chances of winning were higher if this was phony and I let it go versus if it was valid and I challenged. I knew DAEDAL and DEDAL and this made perfect sense, although I had just never seen the word before. Very difficult to challenge this so early on.
>Joshua_Sokol: EJNPQRX 14C J.NX +34 79
#note Especially since this bailed me out of this rack. 
>Jason_Li: AINOSTV C2 VAT +25 206
#note Jason underestimated AINST here, from his own words. 10B VO(E) is the aggressive play and J6 VO(E) is the defensive play here.
>Joshua_Sokol: EMPQRRT 12C Q.T +12 91
#note Gotta do it :/. Maybe not? Exchange? This blocks easy scoring options like TA(J) and HA(J) and will usually keep the 2x2 relatively open.
>Jason_Li: ADINOSU 15F UDO +21 227
#note DINOSAU(R) missed
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMPRRZ J8 .MPRIZER +79 170
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMPRRZ --  -79 91
#note Already felt like this was necessary. I didn't know if this was valid or not and I thought EMPRIZE took at least a D, but alas, EMPRIZE is a noun.
>Jason_Li: AHIINST K2 TAHINIS +78 305
#note I prefer this given the inference, as did Jason. Quackle does not. Whatever
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMPRRZ L1 PIRE +32 123
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMPRRZ --  -32 91
#note Last time I'm ever playing this word I learned through Pokemon.

#note I considered DUFF but after having played a phony 4 already this game I chickened out. I then spotted this and the possibility of a 150-200 point 3x3 next turn with my leave (OFFICERS, OFFTRACK, something miraculous) and decided this was a better play anyway. 
>Jason_Li: EIW A8 WI.E +30 402
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFNORY 4K ..RN +9 150
#note I thought there were at least a few things that would play hooking (HORN)Y next turn, but it seems EYEFOLD and FLYOVER are the only two possibilites. This play is therefore not even a spread-saver. I should probably just play off my Y at A8 or something.
>Jason_Li: EILR A8 ....LIER +45 447
#note Had to challenge, this looked unfamiliar even though there was a time when I knew this was valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFGORY -  +0 150
#note just more chokage
>Jason_Li: ABEU 11D .AUBE +20 467
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFGORY O1 FOGY +60 210
#note I thought F(R)OGgERY was a possibility here but that's not even a word. I thought it was? FORGERY and FROGEYE play here, but this is better for spread.
>Jason_Li: ACEIKRW 14H WACKIER +99 566
#note oh boy
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGHORS 12H HOGgERS +87 297
>Jason_Li: AAILSST N4 .ASALIST. +63 629
#note The most interesting part of this game has arrived! As Jason counts how many tiles there are between 4N and 12S I thought he was just joking. Jason kibitzed "is this good?" and started to put down (N)-A-S-A-L-I-S... and I immediately said "holy sh*t, that's crazy, I think it's good!" or something along those lines, and before he had finished putting his word down I got up to challenge what I thought he was playing, (N)ASALISE(S). Jason didn't come with me and NASALISES was challenged, coming back acceptable. I get back to the table, purely in awe, and I show him my tiles. At some point I notice that he had actually played NASALISTS, not NASALISES, and I said "oh no, I already showed you my tiles but I challenged the wrong word! Can we review this?" Jason said no, as he should have, since I had shown him my tiles, and I was fine with handing him more spread than he should have had... 
>Jason_Li:  (IL) +4 633
#note What an insane game this was. Obviously I had the chance to change the results early by challenging DAEDALIC#, so I do not blame luck for the result of this game, as I shouldn't, ever!
