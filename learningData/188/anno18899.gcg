#note 10E DIE is best, probably because its the best defensively.  I way overvalued ILR as a leave and because of that made a very very bad play.  I should have realized I probably wasn't going to bingo next turn and just kept the z and scored 35 later instead of just dumping it off for 24.
>Judy_Cole: EEY 10E EYE +39 64
#note Mistakes hurt :(
>Sam_Masling: ADILRRS K10 RAD +35 83
#note I get lucky here and draw an A, but if I hadn't that last turn would have really hurt me.  This looks best.
>Judy_Cole: AFIN 11B NAIF +24 88
>Sam_Masling: ?EILORS 13E LOItERS +78 161
#note I didn't know RISsOLE which is definitely best.  Also this was underscored by 2.

>Sam_Masling: AEIIORT M3 IOTA +13 249
#note Quackle mostly wants me to fish of OI, which is valid with 4 n's left, but IOTA kills 3 lines and keeps fine.
>Judy_Cole: NOP 15E PON. +24 198
>Sam_Masling: EHIIPRS N6 HIP +30 279
#note This was a bad auto pilot turn, I just wanted to play points, get rid of both high point tiles and drop them for 30.  When I keep the P, I bingo 36% of the time next turn and this is better defensively.  Just play HI  -11 :(
>Judy_Cole: DIM O7 DIM +33 231
>Sam_Masling: AEGILRS B8 SIG.ALER +76 355
#note Aligners is 3 points better, I'm not sure why exactly, but probably because it makes it a bit harder for them to hit either of the triples.
>Judy_Cole: EORV A5 ROVE +27 258
>Sam_Masling: AEFIITW B4 FEW +32 387
#note 12A W(A)IF is the best play by far, while FEW is okay, it blocks a volatile spot and scores, but I'm not scoring next turn and it still leaves everything open in the bottom left.
>Judy_Cole: IUUU -UUUI +0 258
#note I remember her saying she exchanged 3 U's here.

>Sam_Masling: ADEEITU E3 DU.E +5 414
#note Ok so the thing is ike... sometimes I just suck and forget how to play scrabble.  There are so many better options idek.  I saw adieu but I didn't want to open the triple line but it's a lot better in hindsight.
>Judy_Cole: QT 12A Q.T +24 294
>Sam_Masling: AAEIITU 6E .TUI +6 420
#note So I don't know why I suck, I think it just happens.  At least I'm up 120 right..?  Honestly there aren't plays that are a ton better than this, but they're definitely better and I definitely can see them.
