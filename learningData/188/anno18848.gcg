#note I feel like this is an area where I've matured a lot as a player. In the past I would have thrown down DISkLIKE for 101, but this time I logicked* through it and decided that this play was a much smarter thing to do since I was only like 75% sure DISKLIKE was valid. (DISKLIKE DISCLIKE and DISHLIKE are all good)
