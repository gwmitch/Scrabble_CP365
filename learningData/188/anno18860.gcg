>Sandy: BEHRT 8D BERTH +26 26
>Matt: EIMNNOU 9H ONIUM +13 13
#note I really struggled with this rack, but had I know that BERTH takes a back E in Collins, I might play something like MENU our MEOU.  BUNION is also a good option that scores 3 more than my option and cleans up the rack similarly, without opening a TWS.
>Sandy: AGLOSSU 8K GOALS +29 55
#note Actual rack, she asked about SUBGOALS after the game.  Couldn't pull the trigger, and it's a big swing.
>Matt: AEEELNT O8 .ELENATE +77 90
>Sandy: AEOPSTU F4 APTE.OUS +64 119
#note AUTOPENS is 75, but you need to know the BERTHE# hook.  HOUSETOP H8 is cool.
>Matt: ADEILUY D4 AUDI.LY +26 116
#note Quackle doesn't want me to break up the rack so much, and just play YU# or AYU#.  I got tunnel vision and didn't look much at overlaps down column N.
>Sandy: BIJ C2 JIB +28 147
>Matt: ?CDEFIR 10H DEF +37 153
#note Didn't know FRICADEL#, should pair it with CANFIELD and FRICANDO to remember it.   
>Sandy: ISVW 11K SWIV. +22 169
>Matt: ?CEIORT 15H ORECTIv. +80 233
#note Didn't look very much down row 12, RECTION# might have a bit better defense to go with the extra point.  With the Q and X unseen I am not playing InJECTOR.
>Sandy: ?AGINRW 4F .WARdING +74 243
>Matt: DEKLNRX H1 REL.X +36 269
>Sandy: OOP 14H OOP +25 268
>Matt: ADKNSTV 13I VANT +26 295
#note I have the case S, not sure if I need to burn it just yet.  The K is a better tile on this board.
>Sandy: AEE 2B A.EE +22 290
>Matt: ADEEKOS 1H .ESOAKED +92 387
#note Luckbox, drawing 4 vowels to DKS and bingoing.
>Sandy: HT 2H .TH +29 319
>Matt: ACDFINO 7L OF +23 410
#note Ugh, this is bad.  Lots of nice insertion plays.  Plus that Z spot isn't much of one since I have the case A and O.  
>Sandy: GIIMNR C10 MIRING +25 344
>Matt: ACDINQU B11 QADI +48 458
>Sandy: RYZ K3 R.Z +24 368
>Matt: CNU 7A UNC. +9 467
#note A solid 5-2 day put me back in contention, but I knew that meant a murderer's row in day 3.
>Matt:  (Y) +8 475
