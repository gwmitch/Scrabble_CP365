#note Wasn't quite sure what to do with this so I figured I'd unload one of my S's and set up something with the H on the next turn.  This isn't one of the original choices but it sims very well.  The only play that sims better (and not by much) is LILOS 9F, and the difference isn't that great.
>Aldo_Cardia: DENPSY J9 SPENDY +31 43
>Jim_Burlant: EHLORST 11D HOSTEL.R +94 111
#note Other bingo options include 14C HOSTELRY and H4 HOST(EL)ER, but this scores 94 while none of the others come close.  Play misscored as 86.

>Jim_Burlant: EIMNSVZ 13B VIM +28 139
#note Didn't see a Z play I liked and, once I saw this, I stopped looking:  it scores well, unloads the V,  doesn't give back easy plays, and leaves a solid ENSZ.  80% to win.  Next best play is 13G VEND 23, whicn wins 2-1/2% less often and sims almost 7 points down.

#note You know you're having a good game when you can turn 4 tiles out of garbage like this and and score huge points.

#note Nice play!
>Jim_Burlant: CEMRSTZ 7H MERC +19 189
#note Nothing really scores well here; the goal here was to try and clear as much of the rack as possible. I'm sitting on the case S and the blanks are out, so the L column is mine for the taking unless he defends.  And this gives nothing back at O8, which is a bonus.  The sim agrees:  this is best.
>Aldo_Cardia: AFIR K4 FAR.I +20 160
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEHSTZ J2 CHEZ +40 229
#note Saw this and stopped looking.  Q agrees - trying to set up the Z bomb and holding SZ is not the way to go here.  95% to win, and my next couple of racks ensure that I can't lose this game.  95% to win in a short sim.  Next best play of FETCH 4K wins 3% less often and sims over 8 points down.

#note Though I looked for plays to the Y, the better bingo that I couldn't find was TANISTRY.  That said, the duck indicates bingoing is not best here; I should play L1 TINTS for 36 keeping R?.  And, with hindsight being 20/20, I think the duck is right.  This potentially gives back big plays on row 1, opens up all sorts of bingo lines and doesn't score well for a bingo.  Furthermore, I only burn the blank for 23 more points than I can get if I keep it.  Having said that, the major difference between the plays in the sim is only equity, not winning percentage; TINTS wins  99%; this wins 98-1/4% and coughs up 13 equity.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEORUU 8A .UOD +16 353
#note Not worried about building/grooming another rack.  Since my STRONTIC bingo opened up a bunch of lines, I wanted to add some resistance.  Now he can't bingo down the E column without the blank, and his only other line is the M column.  The sim is more or less irrelevant at this point:  any of my top 5 plays (of which this is one) wins between 99.85 and 99.88%, and the only difference is equity.  Best per the sim is 1F DUE.

#note What are the odds he floats me a T this very turn as I'm sitting on this rack?  This is ridiculous!
