#note Down 200 this early, I don't blame the bingo try here, and Collins/TWL have dumber UN- words in the dictionary.
>Matt: AOPRSTY O4 P.ATY +39 302
#note Missed two bingoes here, OUTPRAYS and PYROSTAT.  Had a hunch I was missing something, didn't think to add the U to this rack and PYROSTAT is a tough 8.

#note Yeah this game was ridiculous.  ZElATRIx has the most style points, but I didn't want to waste Rob's time on this rack right before lunch.

#note TOLL scores 19 and leaves an unlikely-to-be-blocked CORGI for 18, better than my out in 2.  Plus my dog is half Corgi so that's kind of disappointing to miss it.
>Rob: EGITUX M9 XU +38 298
>Matt: ILT 2M TIL +12 594
#note 7-4 with about 1000 spread after 11 games, a good place to be.  Plus a 2nd 600 game in a tournament after playing some 500 tournament games without ever crossing that barrier.  When it rains it pours.
