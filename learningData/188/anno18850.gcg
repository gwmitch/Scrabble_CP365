>Chris_Cree: AGO 10D GOA +11 21
>Matt_Canik: CEGNNQS 11E NEG +16 43
#note This is normally an exchange rack, but Chris didn't swear or bitch or sigh after his draw and he's been playing like he's keeping well so I've got him pegged for a 2x2
>Chris_Cree: FO D8 FO. +11 32
>Matt_Canik: CIJKNQS C7 QI +26 69
#note I set down JINKS and then got really scared that ON didn't take an S. Yeah I don't know my 3s
>Chris_Cree: AIMNRST 7H MARTINS +73 105
>Matt_Canik: ACJKNSU H11 SNUCK +41 110
#note UN(T)ACKS is a 2x2 that I also chickened out on, in addition to all the ONS plays
>Chris_Cree: LPPUY J5 PU.PLY +23 128
#note Wasn't sure this was a word. It is.

>Chris_Cree: DNO 1L DO.N +30 184
>Matt_Canik: ADENTTW 3J WANT.D +20 206
#note No reason to hold ADENT on this board, really. The C is the only spot that I'll really be able to hit a bingo. Row 4 is not a good bingo line with ADENT. 
>Chris_Cree: ??DEFIT 14D DEFI.iTs +72 256
#note I thought he was playing DEFICATE***** for a little
>Matt_Canik: EEIORTZ 15A ZERO +46 252
>Chris_Cree: EEEHIOY 12C EYE +15 271
#note Actual rack
>Matt_Canik: AEIIRTT O1 .I.ER +30 282
#note Held for a long time and released. It's phoney. TEAR(DOWN) is a nice valid play here. 
>Chris_Cree: BEGHIOS 2I GOB +19 290
#note Actual rack again. I don't think Chris makes this play unless he's holding an A. I guess I assumed wrongly. 
>Matt_Canik: AINSTTU 1F TUNAS +24 306
#note I'm definitely thinking he's holding an A here. If he makes a big play with *AH or *AV or *AL on the 1 row, I don't think I can outrun him much. So I decided to block and score to try and win the endgame. I'm worried about bingos down the 4 row to a small extent, but if he hits me then he hits me. ANTI(FOG) is really nice.
>Chris_Cree: EHILOST 4C HOSTILE +79 369
#note If it's any consolation to me, he had (N)EOLITHS anyway.
