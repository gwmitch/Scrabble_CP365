>Jim_Burlant: AEIIPTU 8G PIU +10 10
#note Best.   That said, there's also nothing wrong with exchanging IU or IIU.  
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: FRY I7 F.RY +15 15
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEGIT 10D GAIET. +12 22
#note No really good options available here; best is apparently J10 AGE.  I'll admit, the AIT leave with AGEE J10 is better than this, but I felt like I needed to clear more of the rack and not leave the E hook dangling, lest I start having to grind through vowel overloads on every turn.  This sims way down the list, but that's deceiving; this isn't even in the top 10 yet it's within 1-1/2% winning chances of J10 AGEE, which wins.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: JSW E9 J.WS +28 43
#note Robin was shaking her head at this.  Post mortem, the discussion confirmed the hunches I had during the game:  we had complementary rack problems.  I couldn't stop drawing vowels, she couldn't stop drawing consonants.
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIMW 12A WADI. +26 48
#note Best. WADES and WAMES in the same spot round out the top three choices in the sim; this is best due to leave since the board position is more or less identical.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: BHT B11 B.HT +18 61
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIMO C11 O.EA +26 74
#note Bailed!  Was looking at an exchange before she threw me the lifeline.  This is best.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: EX A14 EX +30 91
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIMQT -AQ +0 74
#note Not knowing TATAMI (which scores 27 at H10) certainly limits my options.   That said, the sim indicates that, given the Q unfriendliness of this board,  exchanging AQ wins more than any other option including TATAMI at 1200 iterations, albeit at the expense of one equity poinit.  If you believe the sim, this is best, TATAMI wins roughly 1/4% less often.  39% to win.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: AV A10 VA. +14 105
>Jim_Burlant: ABEIMOT J5 OBA +16 90
#note I didn't like this play but didn't see much else, and given my deficit (trailing by 31 points on a dead board) with her probably about to go up a bingo if she hit for 30-something at H10,  I felt the onus was on me to open up.  Q likes 7F BO and G6 BOP better.  I sort of see that.  Nothing scores particularly well here, and BO/BOP preserve more of the rack, though I don't think the J column or row 6 are espcially good lines for me to hit.  I'm not really sure what's right here, but this did work out.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: DEMO K5 MODE +33 138
#note While this scored well, Robin was reluctant to put this down, and for good reason -  she's no longer in control of the board.  And what panned out was probably the worst possible case for her:
>Jim_Burlant: EEIMRTT L7 EMITTER +89 179
#note TERMITE also plays at L6 for 86, but this scores 89 and is best.  
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: DIOOT M3 OOTID +28 166
>Jim_Burlant: EINOOOU H10 .OONIE +21 200
#note It's either this, OURIE 13J, or an exchange.  Not much else to do with this garbage.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: AFIT M9 FIAT +26 192
>Jim_Burlant: NORRRUV 15F OV.RRUN +11 211
#note It's either this or exchange 7, and with 4 N's in the bag there's no reason for me to worry about holding it. The game is a crapshoot - I'm a hair over 50% to win.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: EGLLSUY L1 UGLY +30 222
#note Opponent mistakes are a form of luck that you need  to do well in tournaments, and I caught the game changing break on this turn.  This was her rack, and she told me post-mortem that she chickened out on GULLEYS, which would have scored 80 at 4D.  And that would have certainly drawn an unsuccessful challenge from me.  Instead, watch what happens:
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEIPQR 1K Q.IRE +42 253
#note As this came down, Robin's words:  "You're welcome."  This is a strong play but it's not best.  The better play, which I didn't think of, was CIRQUE for 51.   I'm still in the driver's seat at 80% to win, but CIRQUE is clearly superior for reasons beyond the extra 9 scoreboard points that will become apparent soon.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: EZ 11J ZE.. +26 248
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCENNP -CNP +0 253
#note If I find CIRQUE on the previous turn, this position probably becomes a lot easier.  I took a LONG time here.  I saw PEN I3 but couldn't wrap my arms around keeping duplicated C's.  I then saw the obvious CEP I3...but then started second guessing myself, as the cartoon devil tried to convince me that CEP takes the front S (it doesn't).  So, between CEP's creating a board I wasn't entirely sure about and my fear that I would be stuck with triplicated N's and no vowels on my next turn (a distinct possibility given the pool with its 2-to-1 consonant to vowel ratio) I opted to take no chances.  CEP or PEN at I3 is definitely the play here, though the sim indicates that, while this isn't correct, it's not horrible, either.  60% to win.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: AKS J1 SKA +32 280
#note And, if I find CIRQUE, what does she do with this?
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEEHIN 14E EH +26 279
#note An annoying rack, as I spent a lot of time looking for the bingo that isn't there.  The play is either this or to fish off an E with ESQUIRE.  62% to win, and my next rack makes that 100.  
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: ALPS N11 SALP +29 309
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCEINR 3C CoCINER. +76 355
#note ENCIRCLE O1 scores 86 and is clearly better, but for this game this was still enough.
>Robin_Pollack_Daniel: DEGLNNU H1 GL.DE +27 336
#note Any number of 6D plays (fLANS, etc.) scores 14.  Whatever- glad to pull this one out.
