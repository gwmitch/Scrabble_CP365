>Zev_Kaufman: BHITU 8D BHUTI +26 26
>Zev_Kaufman: BHITU --  -26 0
#note I have no idea whether he was testing my word knowledge, or if he confused this with DHUTI.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEGTX 8H AX +18 18
#note WOW.  GATEAuX would have scored 94 at 8F.   If you whiff on the bingo, this is your best option, despite the easy hooks this gives up.  Nonetheless, this is rather embarrassing.
>Zev_Kaufman: BHINOTU 9H BIT +20 20
#note To give you an idea how in-the-zone I was (whiffed bingo notwithstanding), it didn't occur to me until long after the game that he'd kept HU in his rack instead of playing off HUB on this turn.  Nonetheless, this set the stage for the rout that was to transpire:
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGRST K5 GrATERS +84 102
#note Kinda sloppy of me to forget about the H he had kept in his rack.  STAGERS or GRAvEST K5 might have been a smidgen better here.
>Zev_Kaufman: HILO 8K .HIOL +36 56
>Jim_Burlant: ACGNOOT 11D OCTAGON. +72 174
#note Scores 69 at 7B; this scores 72.  'Nuff said.  89% to win.
>Zev_Kaufman: TTUY H11 .UTTY +30 86
>Jim_Burlant: DGNOORS 7B DRONGOS +66 240
#note Whoops - I didn't know GODROONS (only knew GADROONS) and don't ask how I totally whiffed on the AX front hook for 5 more points.  Fortunately, my lead is so large that all the bingoes win within 1% of each other and the loss is merely equity.  97% to win.
>Zev_Kaufman: AEIU B6 A.IEU +10 96
>Jim_Burlant: ADMORRU A8 ARMOUR +39 279
#note Finally, I get a play right.  It's this or A10 MADURO for 37.  Either is as good as the other.
>Zev_Kaufman: ABEINOR 14H .ABORINE +82 178
>Jim_Burlant: ADISUVW O11 WIV.D +39 318
#note Sometimes things come a hair too easily, which leads to autopilot mistakes.  WAIVED would have scored 42 and left me with slightly better balance.  
>Zev_Kaufman: Q M13 Q. +22 200
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEISU A8 ......ED +33 351
#note When it rains, it pours.
>Zev_Kaufman: OW 12C OW +20 220
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIPSU 13A .IPE +26 377
#note It might have been a hair better to dump vowels with EURIPI 6I or URAEI 10J (more turnover, to hasten the end of the game), but the sim likes this best.  99.75% to win.
>Zev_Kaufman: HIP 13F PI.H +23 243
>Jim_Burlant: ACFINSU 6J F.ANC +23 400
#note Best here is a word I didn't know, A1 FUSAIN, which scores 32.  This is reasonable - just playing into lines and turning tiles.  Hopefully I can underlap or overlap along row 6 or 8 and end the game on the next turn.
>Zev_Kaufman: EEKLT C2 KELTE. +22 265
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEISU 1A EASE +26 426
#note Not worried about leave here; just worried about taking away the easy scoring threat and his best bingo line.  Q says I should dump vowels with 10J UREA  or 4C LIEU.  Pfft.
>Zev_Kaufman: AELNSVZ -AELN +0 265
>Jim_Burlant: EEIMNRU 4A RE.UMINE +74 500
#note Other options include 3B MEUNIERE (I always get the tiles transposed with that one), F2 MERINGUE, 4C LEMURINE (saw it, then talked myself out of it), and this.  Once I saw this, I stopped looking.
>Zev_Kaufman: DISZ H1 SIZ.D +45 310
>Jim_Burlant: EFLLNVY 2G L.VELY +14 514
#note How do I miss 2F VEINY for 27?  This is awful!  As you can see, this was just a case of good drawing, period.  Don't know how I missed GATEAUX, the placement of DRONGOS was awful, WAIVED instead of WIVED...sheesh.  This one came too easily.  FAIK, I might have hit 600 if I'd played decently.
