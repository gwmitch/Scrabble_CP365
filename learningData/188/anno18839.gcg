#note I often struggle with racks containing counter overloads like this, and this rack was no exception.The best play statically is MAXIM 7H, but I never saw it.  Best is apparently 9E WAIF.  Makes sense - unloads the two most negative tiles in the rack and scores well, and duplicated M's aren't the worst thing.
>Mike_Baron: NO E10 ON +13 33
>Jim_Burlant: IIMMOPW 7H WIMP +21 51
#note So blinded by the IIMMPW combination that I didn't see anything other than this.  POW D10 is a hair better due to its defensive strength; if you want to point the finger at my play, this is the play that cost me any chance at this game, not that it was looking good to begin with.  48% to win, but not for long.
>Mike_Baron: EGHINSW L1 WHINGES +98 131
#note SHEWING scores 98 at L7 and doesn't slot the triple.
>Jim_Burlant: IIMORSU D4 MURI. +16 67
#note Weak - whiffed on MOHUR 2J, didn't know  SURIMI.  At least this blances the rack, but with 32 points available for MOHUR, this gives up way too much on the scoreboard.  MOHUR wins 18%, this wins 14%.
>Mike_Baron: ACIIL D10 CILIA +28 159
>Jim_Burlant: CEGIOPS 1J CO.PIE +39 106
#note At least I get one play right.  
>Mike_Baron: ?AAERSV 13C A.RwAVES +74 233
#note Paralysis by 1000 choices for Mike.  VAGARIES, AVARICES, PALAVERS, REAVAILS, ABRASIVE, etc.  
>Jim_Burlant: BGHLRST 3J BR.GHT +24 130
#note While my play  to this point has been putrid at times, I haven't been wanting for tile turnover.  Seeing him hit two bingoes in three turns while my turnover yielded this rack...you get the idea.  Anyway, as for this - it's the wrong execution of the right idea.   Don't know how I didn't see BLIGHT.  
>Mike_Baron: AFOR H11 FA.OR +36 269
>Jim_Burlant: LNNNSTY 5C T.NNY +16 146
#note As if I had any doubts about this game...the fat lady isn't singing, but she's warming up.  This is best...and it wins 0.78%.
>Mike_Baron: EOOV K7 .OOVE +20 289
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNST 15H .ETINALS +77 223
#note This is about the only good draw I had this game.  This is slightly better than RATLINES in the same location but it's still bleak:  4.2% to win.
>Mike_Baron: AGJU N11 JUGA. +26 315
>Jim_Burlant: EEENOUZ 4H ZEE +26 249
#note Not that I really thought I had a chance, but I was getting way too protective of my E's, so I never looked for the obvouis play:  HEEZE N3.  Apparently, though, Q says my best play is 4A NEUME for 12.  Certainly makes sense, given that I need a miracle if I'm going to win this.
>Mike_Baron: ADOT O8 DATO +24 339
>Jim_Burlant: EEINOUU 4C E.U +9 258
#note I've more or less given up on the game at this point.  While my play has left lots to  be desired, these draws are also not helping me.  Q says I'm an idiot for even trying to play through this and that I should exchange 6, keeping the U as Q insurance.
>Mike_Baron: ?IQ H1 QuI. +63 402
>Jim_Burlant: EINORTU 5J TI.ER +17 275
>Mike_Baron: EKY 3A KEY +32 434
>Jim_Burlant: BDNOSU A3 .UDOS +11 286
#note Just moving tiles to end the game.
>Mike_Baron: AERT 10M TA. +21 455
>Mike_Baron: AERT --  -21 434
>Jim_Burlant: BN I12 B.N. +12 298
#note If there was something in this game that I felt I could take solace in, it's that in an end game like this it would have been very easy for me to check out mentally and either (a) not pay attention to what Mike had just put down, or (b) even worse, see it and not give a crap about it.  It may ahve been a no-brainer to challenge, but still - at least I could tell myself that, to some level, my head was still in the game and I hadn't stopped fighting.
