>Jim_Burlant: CCDDEIU 8G CUD +12 12
#note The sim is pretty close between this and the top choice, 8D CUDDIE.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EGGORS J2 GOuGERS +71 71
>Jim_Burlant: BCDEIRY 3I C.YER +26 38
#note Chickened out on COYED and couldn't think of CORBY.  CORBY 3I looks right, but my next draw rendered what I did here more or less a moot point.
>Joey_Mallick: EEO 5I O.EE +10 81
>Jim_Burlant: ABDIIOO -BIIOO +0 38
#note Couldn't think of ORIBI, and all I saw was AROID 7I, which I didn't like at all.  Exchanging is unnecessary - ORIBI 7I probably should have been the play. Then again, this worked out.
>Joey_Mallick: EHMUX 6E EXHUM. +38 119
>Jim_Burlant: ABDILNT E3 BID.NTAL +72 110
#note Only bingo.  Back in the game - 35% to win in a short sim.
>Joey_Mallick: ABENPT 4A BEPA.NT +28 147
>Jim_Burlant: EFIINNO 8A FEIN. +27 137
>Joey_Mallick: AINOSSU M5 SUASION +65 212
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIINOR 12G IRONIEs +71 208
#note Couldn't think of IONIzER, which plays at L8 for 73 and wins 33-1/2%.  This wins 31-1/2.
>Joey_Mallick: KNO A1 KNO. +30 242
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEFIT H10 FE.IAE +27 235
#note Best, but the sim indicates I'm more or less treading water here:  I'm hovering around 33 - 34% to win, just like I've been for the last several turns.
>Joey_Mallick: QU 8M .UQ +36 278
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHIMT N10 HA +28 263
#note I saw the AEIMT leave with the unseen R's and felt that 28 plus the good leave would do the trick.  Q indicates that this is a strong choice but the killer play was HIMATIA C7 for 38, which I never saw.  HIMATIA wins 34% per the sim and still treads water:  this wins 29 and sims almost 6 points down.  While my winning chances aren't that good even with HIMATIA, for all intents and purposes this play lost the game for me.
>Joey_Mallick: LLV K11 V.LL +14 292
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIMTT O11 MATTE +29 292
#note TATAMI (a word I didn't know) scores 35 at 15J and ostensibly wins 42%; against his next rack anything other than INMATE D7 wins 0:
>Joey_Mallick: ADRSWZ C7 W.ZARDS +68 360
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIIOW 12A WI.E +24 316
#note Yeah, you could say I checked out of this game after WIZARDS came down.  Not that it really makes much difference now, but WADI scores identically and keeps the E.  
>Joey_Mallick: IRY A12 .IRY +30 390
>Jim_Burlant: AAIOOP B10 PO. +23 339
#note Didn't write this rack down entirely, not sure what the 7th tile was but regardless, the draw was pretty ugly and I was just shuffling tiles.
>Joey_Mallick: GORV 15D GROV. +11 401
>Jim_Burlant: AADILO 14E AD +16 355
#note I think I've cleverly blocked his J setup with this.
>Joey_Mallick: JTT L2 J.T. +22 423
#note Whoops, I didn't.
>Jim_Burlant: AILO F1 LAI. +10 365
#note And I'm so shocked that I didn't see his J play that I just put this down.  JAIL 2L definitely saves a bunch of spread here.
>Joey_Mallick: T 13G T. +6 429
>Joey_Mallick:  (O) +2 431
#note I don't know that this one was winnable, but there was certainly room for improvement on my end.  How do I not see ORIBI on turn 2?  And missing the easy points with JAIL...bleah. Definitely needed to stay in the game after WIZARDS clinched it.
