>Bob: CFILMSU 8F FLIC +18 18
#note He asked about this rack after our game, I mentioned FILUM.  I think it scores well and keeps a strong leave. 
>Matt: AENORST H1 ANOESTR. +77 77
#note ANOESTRI# or ATONERS?  I don't think I can read much about his rack after FLIC.  ANOESTRI# scores 6 more, but it leaves a wide open board, ATONERS takes the S hook but still gives lots of lanes for 8s.  My choice did not work out well.  
>Bob: EMRSTTU J2 MUTTERS +77 95
#note If I play ATONERS, he has to find TESTAMUR# and leave it one short of a DWS.  
>Matt: EGLOQUX 1F QU.G +14 91
#note My play sims just OK, because it scores so little and the leave is not the greatest.  I really like GOXE(S) though.  It scores well, leaves the QU for another turn and blocks the S. 
>Bob: ?AAIRTV 5A VARIATe. +70 165
#note VARIATe plays down column K for 6 overlaps!  
>Matt: ?EELOOX A5 .OXEL +45 136
>Bob: AHI B5 .HI +36 201
>Matt: ?AEEIOZ G3 ZO.A +47 183
#note A big weakness in my game is using the blank for non-bingo, 60+ point plays.  AZIOnE scores 70 and dumps many more vowels.  ZOeA still sims better though, but I'm in trouble with a lot of 3-tile draws next turn.
>Bob: DDLNR D4 D.RNDL +20 221
#note That's where all the consonants are.
>Matt: ?EEEIOW C2 WEE. +17 200
#note TOWIE probably.  If he has the R then fine, but I'm behind and need to manufacture some volatility.
>Bob: AJ 2A JA. +26 247
>Matt: ?EIIORY 3A OY. +20 220
>Bob: BI 2E BI +19 266
#note Ooh, GIB scores 32, making NIM and ZOBU.  
>Matt: ?EGIIRW 4J .WIG +16 236
>Bob: ADEINTU C9 AUDIENT +71 337
>Matt: ?AAEEIR M3 A.AcERIE +70 306
#note The bad draws continue, but at least I found the only bingo here.  I'm still in trouble though.
>Bob: CHIKO 15C .HICKO +57 394
#note Nice play, and that about does it unless I can bingo soon.
>Matt: ENNPRSV L1 VEN.N +16 322
#note I'm not playing VEIN and blocking three bingo lanes I might need next turn.  I'm OK with my choice here.
>Bob: EFGIN N10 FEIGN +47 441
#note I just knew this was coming when I drew into SAPROB(E)S.
>Matt: ABOPRSS 8L B.OS +27 349
#note Now it's my turn to miss the ZOBU placement.  That scores well, leaves 2 in the bag for another chance to fish if necessary.  I liked this play because it created a lane to a triple that he might have to block for only a few points.
>Bob: PUY N1 YUP +21 462
#note He wasn't sure of PUY#
>Matt: AEMOPRS I8 .OMPARES +82 431
#note This or COMPEARS# are the only 2 that play, and this was probably the least likely 8 lane to play.  Managed to cut some spread, but some iffy choices early were punished swiftly.
>Matt:  (DELOT) +12 443
