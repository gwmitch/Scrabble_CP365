#note Nice start!
>Scott_Garner: ILMNR E4 LIMN.R +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: AEILOPY F6 YE. +31 111
#note Tough call - I didn't want to part with the E, but anything that keeps the E gives up way too much on the scoreboard.  This is best, and it wins 81%.
>Scott_Garner: DERRSTT H3 REDST.RT +60 76
#note Only bingo for Scott. 
>Jim_Burlant: AEHILOP D1 HOPE +30 141
#note TI debated between this and PHIAL D1.  PHIAL scores 32 to this play's 30 but leaves me EO which could turn into a vowel overloaded mess in a hurry.  This scored well and left me a balanced AIL so I opted for that.  A sim reveals that four plays (of which this is one) stand out at the very top.  The other chioces aer D2 OPAH (never recognized it), J2 HAPLOID, and PHIAL.  OPAH tops the sim at almost 1900 iterations winning 70.52%; this is 4th best winning 70.18 and simming 1 point behind OPAH.  This is a strong play and it is by no means a bad choice.  But, if I had this one to do again, OPAH D2 would have been my play.
>Scott_Garner: COU 1A OUC. +27 103
#note We post-mortemed this one extensively and I don't remember exactly what the rest of Scott's rack was, but it sounded pretty ghastly.  Had I not floated him the H, he was going to have had to exchange.
>Jim_Burlant: AIILORT J8 .IOL +7 148
#note When I evaluated this play I kept thinking that CLOT C1 left me AIIO when, in fact, it would have left me AIIR.  There is no reason at all for me to do anything but take 25 points for CLOT C1.   The only surprise to me is that this only sacrifices 1-1/2% winning chances and not even 3 points in the sim at over 1000 iterations.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEGIRT L11 GRIDE +24 172
#note Well, the rack grooming paid off...sort of.  The bingo rack came...but it doesn't play.  I was not at all happy with my previous play of DIOL; I felt at the time that, since I'd wasted my previous turn grooming the rack at the expense of points, I wasn't going to do that again and I should just score and turn tiles since both blanks were unseen.  Quackle says I should just fish with 3B GIP or 11J LOG.  YMMV. 
>Scott_Garner: ?AEFIOS M7 FEIjOAS +90 214
#note Nice find!  This is his best bingo and Scott's winning 60% in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: ANNQRTU 15H QUAT. +42 214
#note QUARTE or QUATRE only score 3 more (I autopiloted this), and would have prevented this:
>Scott_Garner: EZ 14J ZE. +66 280
>Jim_Burlant: AADHNNR 8L H.AD +36 250
#note Best.  I can either unload my duplicated A's (3 unseen) or duplicated N's and burn my R to do it with only 1 in the pool.  I opted to keep the R, and Quackle agrees - this is best.  Not quite 19% to win.
>Scott_Garner: BKO 3F BO.K +16 296
>Jim_Burlant: AAINNRX 6H .AX +26 276
#note Inching back in - now up to 21% to win.  Post-mortem, Scott told me it was around this time that the D I'd floated with HEAD was driving him crazy; if he could bingo there, this game was over and he could coast home.
>Scott_Garner: GILNST 11C GLINTS +24 320
>Jim_Burlant: AAINNRV 5J AVIAN +25 301
#note I didn't like what this did to the board since I needed/wanted the bingo line for myself, but the duplicated N's really had to go.  Also, I wasn't thrilled about floating the X a couple of turns ago and I wanted to make sure he couldn't score off of it.  The slightly better play would have been VAGINA C9 for 3 more points, but it turns out that for this game, AVIAN kept me alive:
>Scott_Garner: EINORTT G11 .RITE +21 341
#note His actual rack:  AVIAN blocked what would have been the game clinching INTORTED O1.  His best play here is utterly sickand very difficult for most  humans to look for:  9C TERROR for 23.
>Jim_Burlant: GJNOPRY N2 POR.Y +36 337
#note Didn't like parting with the case R, but I need to score points and this scores a bunch of them.  This is best, and I'm up to 30%.  After I put this down I looked at the score and wondered, how was I even in this game?
>Scott_Garner: COW M1 COW +30 371
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGIJN L4 J.G +22 359
#note The game deciding position.  Without a good place to play JO for meaningful points, the question becomes, which fish to make?  Looking at the pool, I have the case A, so fishing that is out of the question.  I saw JI(G) C9 for 19, then I saw this for 22 (which I misscored as 24 at the time). Complicating this was the realization that I was close enough that, if the bingo rack didn't materialize, I could still possibly pull out an end game and the extra scoreboard points for the L4 play might make the difference.  The play needed to be C9 JIG, a fact which my next rack hammered home.  
>Scott_Garner: MTU N13 MUT +15 386
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEILN O1 NEE +20 379
#note No bingoes play.  Had I fished off the I instead of the G, I'd be bingoing with GALENITE on row 13 and coasting.  Instead, I've burned my time down to next to nothing, and the shame of this is that, despite not having the bingo, I still had the win, and missed it.  LENEs plays at O1 for 37 and leaves me AI as an out, and he can't go out in one with this clunk. Instead, I burned my clock down to nothing looking for the bingo that wasn't there and slapped this down with barely 9 seconds on my clock.
