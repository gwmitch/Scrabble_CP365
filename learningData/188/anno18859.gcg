>Matt: DLOSUWX 8D WOULD +26 26
#note WOULD does take an S in Collins (which would then take a T!), that's good to know.  WOX# scores the same, but I didn't like where DLUS was heading on that board.
>Marty: AEINORR D4 IRON.ARE +72 72
>Matt: CDERSXZ C9 ZED +49 75
#note Sheesh.  I was convinced that IRONWARE didn't take an S.  Turns out that they do, and that it's the -WEAR words that don't really take an S in TWL, but in Collins many -WEAR words do take an S (but not all, like PLAYWEARS*, SKIWEARS*, SLEEPWEARS*).  ZEDS is 72 flipping points and I have the X for next turn.  Even if he hits the Z back for 40, I'm in good shape.
>Marty: AGGRY E10 AGGRY +33 105
>Matt: ABCEHSX 13C CA.EX +44 119
#note EXARCH seems a wee bit aggressive, I think CAREX is fine.
>Marty: MORV 6B VR.OM +24 129
>Matt: BEHOPRS C2 BOH +21 140
#note Not playinig this for 2 more points at 14A.
>Marty: IQ D1 QI +25 154
>Matt: AEOOPRS 12G OROSEPA +79 219
>Matt: AEOOPRS --  -79 140
#note Ugh.  I even looked at this stupid word right before the game, and still misspelled it.  Such awfulness.  Thankfully this plays in 5 different places so I'll get a chance to play it right next turn.
>Marty: GINNN 2C ..NNING +12 166
#note Forget what his other two tiles were, but he mentioned that he couldn't do anything about row 12.  
>Matt: AEOOPRS 12G OROPESA +79 219
>Marty: CISST N10 CISTS +36 202
>Matt: AEEIJKL 14J JAKE. +32 251
#note I debated between KEA, JAPE, and JAKES.  Maybe EKE is worth considering as well, keeping JAIL in reserve with a lot of E's unseen.  I'm trying to dig for a blank and ditch the ugly tiles this turn.
>Marty: ALTW 15H TWAL +32 234
>Matt: EEILNTV L5 VEINLET. +62 313
#note Lucky to draw into this and that the spot stayed open.
>Marty: DEIMO 8J MO.IED +27 261
>Matt: ADEEIOP 1F ODEA +29 342
#note Quackle likes IDEA better.  I can see IDEA, since I have the case O and there are two I's unseen.  
>Marty: AU B6 .AU +6 267
#note Nice way to fork another lane open.
>Matt: EEHILPU O3 HEILE. +11 353
#note I can't do anything about column A.  But I can block rows 3 and 5 plus columns N and O.  Just wish I could score more, but I felt the P would be useful in the endgame.
>Marty: ?EFIIST A8 nIFTIES +83 350
#note Only bingo...and what I leave in the bag is quite comical.  This game is about to get bizarre.
>Matt: ABFNPRU N1 FRAP +27 380
#note So somehow, I've managed to not draw any of the three hooks for nIFTIEST.  Because I was fast-playing Marty, I had about 12 minutes to go here to his 1.  I couldn't find an out of 2 that would outrun TUnY#, so I went for a distraction play, hoping he would play YUFT# up top instead, and I would have BUN along row 12 (making BOX first, but then saw that BUNT was better after he played).  Turns out if I play BUNT first for 24, I have FRAP for 33 over the top, putting me at 412 with the T on his rack, and I can just barely outrun TUnY#, which puts him at 410.  
>Marty: ?TTUY 1L YU.T +42 392
#note Lucky for me, he completely whiffed on the hook, and my distraction worked.  We both made big mistakes this game, but I'll take the win.
>Matt: BNU 11I BUN. +24 404
>Matt:  (T?) +2 406
