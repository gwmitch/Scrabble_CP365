#note 8E AUTO
>Rafi: DEEGHIT 9C EIGHT +24 24
#note Having already vanquished one Reinke the previous day, I was confident entering this game against the other Reinke. Jeff Fiszbein was also nowhere to be seen, which helped calm me down a little.
>Thomas_Reinke: AMNORTV 7G VAT +23 35
#note E4 MARTAGON. Second time this tournament I've missed a second-turn double-double through two letters. Lesson learned.
>Rafi: DEEFLTU J6 FUEL +22 46
#note I preferred this over FUELED in order to keep it closed. TED is also a dynamite leave, and I have some double-double potential through AG.

>Rafi: DEENNOT L2 ENDNOTE +74 120
>Thomas_Reinke: CINORRR C9 .RROR +10 69
#note Yeah sure Quackle, 2H CRORE seems like tons of fun.
>Rafi: AEIIPYY 3J PI.Y +18 138
#note The extra vowel doesn't go well with AIY, so PINEY is better. I think I wanted to save YE to overlap ERROR.
>Thomas_Reinke: CILNOR 12C .RCINOL +20 89
#note Lots of good stuff still in the bag.
>Rafi: ?AAEEIY 11G AYE +15 153
>Thomas_Reinke: BEGGIII -BGGIII +0 89
#note Wasn't sure of 4E BIGGIE, and really didn't want to lose a turn. This isn't a ton worse.
>Rafi: ??AAEIL 4D ALcAIdE +66 219
#note Picked this bingo to avoid setting up S-PA. Otherwise, would have played something like VEDALIA to make it hard to open the left side. It's a good strategy to draw both blanks against both Reinkes. Jeff Fiszbein is still nowhere to be seen.
>Thomas_Reinke: EFHKSUW H1 KUF. +33 122
>Rafi: EGPQRTZ 3A PREZ +41 260
#note This was a really tricky decision for me. At this point I'm 13-11 +135, and really need to win out to cash, although 19-12 with a big spread might do the trick. With both blanks out, I'm not too concerned with a triple-triple, but that's definitely the easiest way for me to lose this game. I decided that going for a big win was important here, which is why I played PREZ over ZEP.

>Thomas_Reinke: BDDENWX 14F DW.NED +17 187
#note Maybe I can draw a big X play?
>Rafi: IJQSSST 14A QIS +30 323
>Thomas_Reinke: BDIORTX 15A ID +45 232
#note Just need an E for 15K OXTER.
>Rafi: IJSSTTV H6 V..S +17 340
#note Considered exchanging to avoid telegraphing the S, as Thomas might need to open up a desperation s-hook lane in order to try to win.

>Rafi: BEIJSTT 2F JE. +26 366
>Thomas_Reinke: AABORTU 13K AB +7 282
#note 2B preserves OUT- bingos starting at M7, realistically though nothing I do will work. I was angling for ROBUSTA or something after this, maybe he wouldn't be able to block everything? Spread was no issue after I tied earlier in the tournament.

#note 2 for 2 against the Reinkes, a feat never accomplished in the history of Nationals until this day.
