#note I know he has an A now for the front hook, but this play seems so much stronger than the alternatives that I think I need to make it. A sim with opponent's partil rack set to AEGW still ranks this as the best play.

#note FIN(I)T(O) 4H for 34 is a really good play here. It's touh to bingo from N or T, so I don't feel awful about stringing these out for him. I'm also setting up an F at B10, which I feel really good about.

#note Chris pshawed at his draw before this turn, which makes me think his rack is bad, even after this. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEFFLT B10 FA.L +32 334
#note I really should have spent more time here. 

I'm stuck on this notion that he has a bad rack. Bingoing is a moderate possibility for him, but I don't think it's horribly likely. FAIL allows me to outrun any nonbingo, probably even if I end up with the Q. 

Q lists (N)AFFED as the best play. I didn't know NAFF was a verb, and losing a challenge right now is the worst thing I can do. (I'm not a results-oriented person either, but he still bingos out with his rack after NAFFED). 

Here's what I should be thinking, I think: even if Cree bingos, drawing the Q on his post-bingo rack is going to make him lose most of the time. I don't think I should play off as many tiles, then. EF B9 is probably better. 

I dunno. Thoughts?

#note Fuck me. Fuck Scrabble. Back to the Golden Rule of Scrabble: If the opponent needs an improbable event (or in this case, a series of improbable events) to occur, then those events will always occur.

#note This marks the 2nd consecutive game where an my expert-level opponent apologizes and says they bagged me (Chris and Darrell), and the third straight game where my expert-level opponent has double-blanked me. 

It's extremely humbling to see that I left room for improvement in each of these, and that I was able to stay in striking range each time.
