>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EEILTTU (challenge) +5 87
>Toh_Weibin: EEISTUW F8 .UE +6 6
#note Weak play to start off - the best play is WE 7H. I was trying to keep the board very open but (G)UE doesn't do much. EWE 7G and E(M)U are other decent options.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EEILTTU 7H TUTEE +22 109
>Toh_Weibin: EIIOSTW E10 TOWIE +18 24
#note K5 WO(ES) is better here. TOWIE blasts the board open but a careful fish is superior.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ABELLPR 15A BLEAR +33 142
>Toh_Weibin: AAEIINS D10 AIA +21 45
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: IJNOOPX F13 OX +52 194
#note NOX is better
>Toh_Weibin: EINRRSV H2 INVER..RS +66 111
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: IJLNNOP 5D JINN. +24 218
#note JOLE would be better
>Toh_Weibin: ?DKOSUV C12 DUK. +25 136
#note Simulation prefers DOV(E) at the same spot. I was less confident of getting a bingo with KSU?, or finding one.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AEGLOOP D2 POO.A +28 246
>Toh_Weibin: ?IIOSTV 3H .OVITIeS +72 208
#note VI(N)OSITy and VITIOuS are better choices here. Saw the first but wasn't sure.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: BDEGLNY N2 B.NDY +36 282
>Toh_Weibin: IMNOQRR O1 QI. +40 248
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ADEGLRT 2A GRA.ED +28 310
>Toh_Weibin: ADMNORR O6 ARMOR +26 274
#note (G)ORMAND is the standout play here, but I somehow wasn't sure of it.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AAEFLLT 10J FALLE. +19 329
#note GALLATE/GALLETA would be best
>Toh_Weibin: DEEEEGN A1 E.GED +27 301
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ACCLTTU -ACCLTTU +0 329
#note Changed 7 here with 7 in the bag in the hope of drawing the juicy F/H/Z etc. CUITTLES is definitely the best. CLAUT would have been decent too although i was worried that I would draw no vowels next turn.
>Toh_Weibin: AEEHPTZ B10 ZEA +40 341
#note ZE(T)A is much better here - no need to worry about a bingo from WZY's side. Too defensive a play.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: FINOSWY 3C W.F +33 362
>Toh_Weibin: AEHNPTT B4 HEPT +23 364
#note The best plays utilise the (POOJA)H hook, which I did not see. My play does not win many games.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: CINOSUY M9 C.OYS +26 388
#note NOISY 11J should be best. But CLOYS wins anyway
>Toh_Weibin: ACLNT 12H CANTL. +28 392
>Toh_Weibin: ACLNT --  -28 364
#note Had to try this to sneak the game past Zhi Yuan. I thought that I played quite poorly this game, overall - missing (G)ORMAND and POOJA(H) were costly.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: INU A7 UNI +11 399
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan:  (ACLNT) +14 413
