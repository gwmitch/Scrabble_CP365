#note With THREE spots to cash QI for at least 44, I am going to win an endgame where we try to score more points than each other. The only way I can lose this game is if he bingos. As such, I should pass up on QI right now and block his bingo lines.

PARV(O) does not let me determine anything about his leave- given last turn's game situation, I think he plays PARVO from any rack that holds APRV that can't bingo. That would throw out the possible leaves of EES, EIS, EIT AIO, and EOS. PARV(O) from APNRSTV makes as much sense as PARV(O) from AAAEPRV, so aside from knowing he doesn't have those 5 combinations I can't draw much else from his play. 

If I cash QI now and he bingos, I might be in a bad position- it'll be a close endgame if nothing else. If I play V(A)RA, the only way he can beat me is if he plays (R)ESINATE. I block the rest of the bingos. 

The 100% win here, though, is (A)RVO. Nothing in the remaining pool bingos to the R, so I don't have to worry about blocking the front side. This was a bad oversight on my part, and this is one of those scenarios where making the 2nd best play instead of the best play really does make your butt sore from getting whupped.
