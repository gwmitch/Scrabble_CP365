>Sam_Towne: EORT 9H ROTE +27 103
>Joshua_Sokol: ??AANNO L3 NAAN +21 47
#note AbANdON(ER) was what I was looking for. I this this is fine though, given my deficit. I didn't know GOANNAS or ANNONAS either, which both play for a respectable 72. The other non-bingo choice here is ANOA L2.
>Sam_Towne: BEIR 3I BRI.E +20 123
>Joshua_Sokol: ??GLORS M8 SLOgGeR +75 122
#note No way in hell I would have seen pL(E)dGORS M1! That's sick... I think BRINER/pRoLOGS may be better here, defense-wise. I wasn't sure SLOGGER or BRINER were good.
>Sam_Towne: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 123
>Joshua_Sokol: BFGHKPW -BFGKPW +0 122
#note I had no idea what to keep here, but apparently HP is best. No way I'm making a play here.
>Sam_Towne: EINNTV 12G VENTIN. +24 147
>Joshua_Sokol: ADHJLRT H11 J.HAD +48 170
>Sam_Towne: FOSU 14J FOU.S +32 179
>Joshua_Sokol: DGLQRTU F6 DR.G +10 180
#note Here's where I played extremely paranoid. If I'm going to do this though, G(E)LD or (E)RG are probably better. 
>Sam_Towne: BE 11K BE. +18 197
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNQTU 4D QUINTA +36 216
#note More paranoid blockiness. I think in hindsight, QU(A) here is probably better
>Sam_Towne: ILMSS 5B SLIM +31 228
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEFLRT 7H FA +17 233
>Sam_Towne: EIKSWY 6J W..KY +31 259
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOPRT 15A PORTALE. +86 319
>Sam_Towne: EOPT 2H POET +19 278
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHIMTX 6A EH +26 345
#note I'm wasn't quite sure what to do here. That was a good play on Sam's part. I didn't see THEI(S)M B1 though, that seems like the correct play. MIXE(S) I didn't like. My play is 3rd in a 4-ply sim, so that's reassuring.
>Sam_Towne: COS 1G COS +33 311
#note I was relieved that he played this.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIMTXY N9 AX +52 397
#note All game I was afraid of the 52-point X-bomb, and even more so after WONKY, since it made it more difficult to score well on the triple after an X play. I could also go for AY at the same spot for points next turn, but I don't think that's the brightest idea.
>Sam_Towne: DUW N1 WUD +23 334
#note I would think he would have done the better WUD. Probably just a miss or a hope that I would challenge.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIMRTY O7 MIRY +43 440
#note RIMY... MITY is better than both.
>Sam_Towne: ADEIIUV A6 .VADE +27 361
#note AIVE(R) 7B gives Sam 13 more points in the endgame.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIOT O1 ET +23 463

>Joshua_Sokol: EIO I11 O.E +19 482
>Sam_Towne: I G3 I. +3 369
#note POET was underscored by one point.
