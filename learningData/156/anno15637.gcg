#note Best after simulation, but maybe I should have played something like FEH 13B, as I wasn't sure if FLONG took an S.

>Toh_Weibin: EFGHORU A6 EUGH +31 252
>Toh_Weibin: EEFIOOR (challenge) +5 257
#note My first obvious miss of this game - FUERO A4 is clearly superior. A couple of other moves simulate higher than EUGH but taking out the spot was the priority.

>Toh_Weibin: EEFIOOR 4A ROOF +35 292
#note Holding the R back could prove useful here, but I was trying to limit the scoring opportunities.

#note EASYING scores more. WB - desperation challenge!
>Toh_Weibin: AEIJMST 13A JAM +38 370
#note Perhaps fishing off the J at I3 and hoping for ETAMINS would work here, but I wasn't too confident of that play against someone who would almost certainly block the spot. Other suggestions are JA 13B and (H)AJ C12 (perhaps going for EMETINS or EMETICS), but I like my play the best against a human opponent as it takes advantage of Zhi Yuan's potentially consonant-heavy rack.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: CNPQRRZ B13 .RC +10 423
#note ZOBO would have won actually, but ARC worked out as well as i drew no vowels next turn.
>Toh_Weibin: EEEISTT B3 T. +2 372
#note The best play here is to out in two and catch either the Q or the Z. I thought that a sequence like that would certainly lose, so I attempted to complicate the endgame a little. Turns out the sequence of I(C)ES 15A and TETE N9 loses only to Z(OBO), so I could have tried that and hoped Zhi Yuan didn't see ZOBO (he did).
