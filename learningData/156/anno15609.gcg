#note This was the last game of Day 1, and I was already exhausted after my loss to Will Anderson. I was hoping for an easy game.

#note I held this play for more than a minute, not looking at the blank slip. I had thought he had played SALVOES. I could feel my composure slipping from me. I had studied like a motherlovin sorcerer for this tournament, but there were two lists I didn't get to, the -OES words and my list of phonies. If I hadn't spent so much time at the airport panicking about my possibly canceled flight, I would have studied both lists and this wouldn't be happening. Nonetheless, I made the right decision and released the hold.

#note Have you ever played Super Smash Brothers? You have this bubble/ shield thing, but if you use it too much, it just shatters, leaving you stunned and totally vulnerable. It's a terrible noise, and death is soon to follow. This was the play that broke me.  (-18) 
>Matt_T: AQT 7F QAT +16 296
#note And I even warned myself to always look at the blank slip. Remember the QvOIT game vs. Stefan Rau a few years ago? I sure do. You can't just assume that it's the letter you think it is. And all you have to do is look at the blank slip, and for whatever reason, I didn't do it.
>Carl: DEELRRU 5E RUDE +16 224
#note REZERO is slightly better positionally. (-1)
>Matt_T: GIP D3 GIP +20 316
#note Naturally, it is easier to discern the phony when there's a big letter "R" plastered on the blank. Over the board, you don't have that luxury.

#note Hoping to draw the X. QI F7 wins the sim, but come on, he's gonna block that. (-10?)
