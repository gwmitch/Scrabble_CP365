#note (Anno reedit- 6/13/2015) I thought I played this game really well at the time. But now I've very much matured as a player, so I'm able to recognize how poorly I truly played this game, two years ago.

#note This is bad- should either play BAULK(S) or BAULK, setting up the Y. Now (6/13/2015) I prefer BAULK.

#note Toss up between this and LOTAHS. Now, I prefer this since I bingo 23% as opposed to 10% after LOTAHS, while both give back a comparable amount.

#note Sims very close to best, but I might want to play HOP instead. I got caught up in being too volatile a the time because I was playing David, but HOP is just fine.

#note Should have played the straightforward MOXIE for 45 and pulled within a bingo, instead of making this play to draw one of the three S's for S(I)X at j4, but accomplishes nothing else. A very poor move.

>Siddharth_Murali: EFIIOVX M10 .IEF +22 234
#note Instead of still playing for an S, I should have played VEXI(L) and go for a miracle 8 ending in G or C. Since he's bound to muck up the top left anyway, I should just take the improved score and leave.
