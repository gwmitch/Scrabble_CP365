#note I went back and forth between 4A ZOON and 15J ZOON, blocking GiGATON (I DARE someone to try GOATING* on me).  GIGATON is the most threatening bingo at 89 points, but I'll still win by five if I play ZOON.  But what are the chances that Quackle has both Gs and a blank on its rack?   I spent about 3 minutes looking for playable bingos in the pool and I only saw GIGATON and INTAGLIO, completely missing TANGELO.  But that's probably a moot point since I knew that Quackle probably has bingos on different parts of the board and I can't block them both.  Q's recommended play is 15J ZOO.  ZOO wins by 1 after INTAGLIO so that means my play is better.  Quackle is going to bingo out regardless, but unless I do something incredibly stupid - E3 ZONA for instance - I have the game in the bag.
