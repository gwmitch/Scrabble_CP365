>Carl: ACEEERT 10E .ECREATE +64 108
#note I did see ETCETERA for one more point, but thought RECREATE was better positionally, allowing a more open board and not opening a big lane that closes the board. (-1?)
>Will_A: INO A12 .OIN +33 155
>Carl: IILQSWY J6 QIS +42 150
#note Tough decision. I had considered playing WILY F3 or QIS first but figured that ILWY was a better leave on this board and played in two places (F3 and 11K). Quackle disagrees and is probably right. F6 is simply too large of a hotspot to pass up, whereas QIS will still be there next turn.  (-5)
>Will_A: ?AELRST M7 cRESTAL +75 230
>Carl: EEILUWY F3 WILY +37 187
#note If I had known I was gonna draw EEU, then WILY looks even better last turn. That all four Us were unseen added extra value to the Q.
>Will_A: AZ L12 ZA +46 276
>Carl: DEEOPUV B9 UVE. +15 202
#note Way off. Quackle takes the points with ROUPED H10 (-9). I do need to bingo and keep the board open, but DOPE isn't a good enough leave, and Column A isn't a good enough lane.

>Carl: BCEHKTW C2 ECHT +26 296
#note An interesting play. I have the case W and there isn't much Will can do about the spot that doesn't open something else.  I noticed that ECHT draws to GOWK or HOWK. Will probably didn't have a G last turn or else he would have played DIGIT. Nonetheless, Quackle prefers the more straightforward BETH B3. (-5)
>Will_A: IINP O4 PIIN. +11 348
#note Will grimaced and retracted this play before painfully proceeding with it. This led me to believe that he did not have the X. If he was bluffing and did hold the X, he picked a splendid time to do this, because I am retiring from Scrabble and am not likely to ever play him again.
>Carl: BEKOOUW 1A BOW +37 333
#note A classic mistake! You make a stylish setup and then fail to look at what your opponent just opened for you.  The right play by far retains the W-- EBOOK N2. (-25) This was one of the costliest mistakes of the tournament. EBOOK wins 48% against BOW's 17%. Note: I am still in trouble after EBOOK. I'm burning most of the remaining vowels, keeping UW, and giving Will first crack at REBOOK. Next turn, my rack will often be so bad that I won't be able to capitalize on WECHT. Nonetheless, this mistake alone makes this game among the most "winnable" of my losses. 
>Will_A: DIR 4L DRI. +14 362
#note Or how about just BOOK, sacrificing 22 points but keeping the case E for EBOOK? Quackle says that it's almost but not quite worthwhile. I actually prefer BOOK. Vowels are scarce, and BOOK sets up the board in a way that I can use it but he can't. EBOOK makes things too easy for Will if he has an R.
>Carl: EGGKOUX 14J GOX +34 367
#note I spent absolutely forever on this play and not near enough time on the previous one. Quackle believes that KI 6N wins if the right tile is in the bag. Is it correct? I'm not seeing it. -14?

#note Exhausted and out of time. UKES G1 is best. (-28) (-10) overtime penalty.
