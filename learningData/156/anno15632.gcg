>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ABEFHMN 8E FEHM +24 24
#note Best move (:
>Toh_Weibin: BIIILRU E8 .ILII +16 16
#note Another option is (F)IBRIL which isn't as strong due to the IU leave. ILIU(M) H4 didn't score enough to merit consideration, even though it has a better leave.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ABELNRS I3 BRANLES +77 101
>Toh_Weibin: ABGORUU D11 BOURG +28 44
#note Best option here is BAGU(I)O 12A. BOURG is second best. Other options include GOBUR(R)A 4D and the rather open AU(S)UBO 9G.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: ACGPTWY 15D .AWCY +42 143
>Toh_Weibin: AEEEEOU -  +0 44
#note I changed 6, keeping E here.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: GIIOPST 6C POSITI.G +67 210
>Toh_Weibin: ADDEEIN 9E .DEA. +20 64
#note Win percentage is rather low at this stage. (I)DEA(S) is the best balancing move, but other options to consider are (B)ANDIED and DE(POSITING), depending on one's risk appetite.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EISTUVZ C6 .UTZ +26 236
#note PUTZ gives a better leave, and WB's last move strongly indicates a duplicate A or D for counterscore against ZIT.
>Toh_Weibin: ADEINRR 9A RI. +12 76
#note Simulates poorly compared to other choices - probably more sensible to fish an R here.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EEIKMSV A7 KE.VE +36 272
>Toh_Weibin: ?ADENRT 14H bARTEND +72 148
#note Keeping the S hook available.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AAGIMSX 5D MAXI +45 317
>Toh_Weibin: OOQTVWY -  +0 148
#note A possibility is YOW 15M, which I neglected. Exchanging all simulates second best here. I changed 6, keeping the T. Either way, it was very unlikely that I would catch up at this point, and spread preservation should have mattered more - but this was a practice game, and I try to win all my practice games.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AAGJNSU 4G GA.JUN +36 353
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AAGJNSU --  -36 317
#note Confused with GARJAN/GURJUN
>Toh_Weibin: EEEINTT 4C TEE +19 167
#note Is on top after a long simulation.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AAGJNSU 4G GA.JAN +34 351
#note Otherwise, GARJAN's still the best move.
>Toh_Weibin: ?EFINOT M7 FENThIO. +80 247
>Toh_Weibin: HOW (challenge) +5 252
#note Glad to be sure enough to lay this down.
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: EINOOSU 5K EUOI +14 365
#note EE/EUOI at N8 is better, keeping the N for EEN.
>Toh_Weibin: HOW H1 WHO. +34 286
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: AELNOOS N7 ALOO +19 384
#note LANOSE (forming BARTENDS) would be a superb defensive move and sims slightly ahead of ALOO.
>Toh_Weibin: DELOPRU 12G PRELUD.O +74 360
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: CENSSTV O6 VEST +39 423
#note C
>Toh_Weibin: ADNQRY K11 Q.A. +26 386
>Wong_Zhi_Yuan: CNS 8L C... +9 432
#note KERVES would be best to block RYND
>Toh_Weibin: DNRY B11 RYND +18 404
>Toh_Weibin:  (NS) +4 408
