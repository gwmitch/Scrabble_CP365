>Joshua_Sokol: EEFHIO -FIEO +0 0
#note Can't make out what I left here. 
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEMNTV H4 VENTED +28 28
#note I was going to have to worry about PREVENTED the whole game (except usually my opponents wouldn't spot it), but I didn't know CON(VENTED). If he kept his M last turn this is a good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEHLNY 5G B.LAY +20 20
#note BE(N)NY seems to be the superior play. I love E's too much I guess. (T)HY would have been nice but I was pretty sure he still had that M.
>Siddharth_Murali: EEMOZ J2 ZOE.E +36 64
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFHNRR K3 FR. +16 36
#note My play sims pretty well. I'm in a bad position here though. I kind of like F(O)EHN though.
>Siddharth_Murali: EMTU L1 MUTE +30 94
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHNNR 3J ...EN +16 52
#note I don't see why 2 more points is better if it leaves me with 1 less vowel. Maybe I should play HEN I8 or G8.
>Siddharth_Murali: OOT 1L .OOT +18 112
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGHNOR 6F HO. +18 70
>Siddharth_Murali: AAGLNRT 8E ARG.NTAL +60 172
#note Took him a bit to see this but knowing Sid's difficulty in anagramming (especially 8s) this is a good find.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILNR J8 .ANGLIER +63 133
#note It also took me a while to play this as well, as I was uncertain of its validity. I flat out didn't see TRIANGLE in the same spot or ALLERGIN through the L. I suck at finding anagrams of words I know (in this case RELATING) but there's no excuse for missing TRIANGLE or ALLERGIN. I saw GANGLIER but I was even less sure of it.
>Siddharth_Murali: JOW 9C JOW +26 198
#note Sid held this for a long time and I drew courtesy tiles. He let it go with reluctancy. He made the right decision though.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEOST 10C ODA +22 155
#note I didn't really want to make this play with the C's in the bag, but I felt the need to make the best equity play due to my deficit.
>Siddharth_Murali: DOY 15H DO.Y +24 222
#note Maybe he missed (AWA)Y but I think he felt the need to block the most dangerous spot, which I agree with.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAERSTX I12 AX +36 191
#note I don't know if I should have done this, since it cuts off lanes. the sim agrees with my play, though.
>Siddharth_Murali: DIP E4 DIP +21 243
>Joshua_Sokol: AEPRRST H1 PRE...... +45 236
#note Yay. Just like that I'm back in the game.
>Siddharth_Murali: IIII -IIII +0 243
#note I don't remember how many he exchanged. Maybe it was all of them.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIQRST D3 QAT +32 268
#note QI D3 seems to be obviously better, given the pool. Maybe even QA(D)I to leave me that R, but I think I should start closing a bit more given my lead.
>Siddharth_Murali: CELSU B10 CLUES +39 282
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIIRSU L8 .IEU +4 272
#note Damn. (BO)U(G)IE with the same tiles. How did I miss that? I was so reluctant to play this, too... Sim is liking exchanging and many other plays such as EURI(P)I more than this. I feel like I'm in trouble again after this.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?BIS A13 BIS +21 303
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIRSS F10 SERIF +28 300
#note What to play here? am I so desperate that I need to play SEIF or is it just my best shot? I'm pretty certain he has a blank here so do I really want to open an E? I'm content with having the case S for a possible (LIEU)S hook and bringing the game within 3 points.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CIIKNV M11 NICK +22 325
#note Here is Sid's absolute disaster blunder. I debated this position with a lot of people after the game and I was pretty sure I could win regardless of what he plays. I thought C(AL)Ks would be enough to outscore but the sim is liking (BE)CK and E13 KI the most.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGHRS N5 cHARGES +73 373
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AIIMUV N14 AI +16 341
#note Best plays here are Ar(R)IV(AL) and VI(R)tU(AL) 12D. Sid didn't really care at this point though, which could have proven to be a fatal mistake! Overscored by 2!
>Joshua_Sokol: INOTW 2N WO +24 397
#note I should go with (JO)INT first. I think I only saw it after WO though.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?IMUV 3B sU. +22 363
#note VIRTUAL is best, for the second time :P
>Joshua_Sokol: INT C9 ..INT +38 435
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IMV) +16 451
