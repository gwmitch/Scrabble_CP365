#note Chickened out on FRANC.  I saw K2 FINS, but passed it up because I wanted to keep the S.  In hindsight, I probably wouldn't have played FRANC even if I were 100% sure it was good.  FANON is the more annoying play because of what it does to the right side of the board.

#note Missed 1K DROPT.  I wasn't even looking there because I was too busy being annoying.  I wanted to block the most threatening lane - row 15.   I passed up 14F CREDO because I wanted to keep a vowel.

#note Preendgame time!  I played this to clean up my rack and leave one in the bag.  I figured unless I draw JQUUU - PUHLEEZE that aint gonna happen - I can play a decent endgame.

#note I spent six minutes on this rack.  I had to retrack a bit because I had the unseen pool as AIJOTTU.  Once I got his rack right, I started looking for my best plays.  The first thing I saw was HEWER, but that can't be a good play because that doesn't leave me an out.  Eventually I see MEINY, but I played that WITHOUT seeing 6L HUED.  I fully expected Roy to play 6B JOW and I'll go out with JEHU.

#note Just as planned.  Now if he would have played at M7 I would have been pissed off.
>Tasha: EHU B6 .EHU +14 412
#note 6L HUED for three more points.
