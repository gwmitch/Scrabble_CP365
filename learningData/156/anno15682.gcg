#note so TZETSE# is a word, but not TSETZE*, and there's also TZETZE and TSETSE. let's all switch to collins because it makes it slightly better! also ZIFF#. i actually did think of tzetse fwiw. (-14)
>raunak: MO F5 OM +31 49
>cesar: EHRTUUW 7C WU. +10 46
#note yay, this would have been an exchange in TWL. a WUS# is a term for a pal, in South Wales apparently, which means a Welsh word has to do a lot with the Scrabble we play in the USA/Canada.
>raunak: DGI D3 GID +23 72
#note DZO# is some sort of cattle yak thing, which is better since that's an animal and that's what it's called. it can be spelled about 10 different ways.
>cesar: EHIRTUX E5 ....IER +32 78
#note well crap. i didn't consider UG#. hey, it's been almost a year now since i last looked at Collins. UG means to arouse loathing in, apparently in Middle English or Old Norse. isn't that what they spoke in Lord of the Rings? (-13.5)
>raunak: DEELNRS 4F SLENDER +73 145
>cesar: DHITUUX D9 THUD +25 103
#note UG again, DUX# is better there. hey at least that one works in words with friends. (-8) DHUTI where i played THUD is also almost as good as DUX, should have seen it! apparently collins is much harder though or something.

#note dammit i should have played LINUX# just for fun. yes LINUX, the proper noun is a word
>raunak: ALO 8A LAO +14 184
#note i did actually hold on this but didn't want to give him another 5 points. why would he play a phony three on me? 
>cesar: BELNRUY 3K BURLY +26 174
#note i thought he might be vowel heavy so this didn't seem too bad. 3A BULGY looks good too.
>raunak: AR O1 AR. +18 202
>cesar: EELNQTW 5K NEWT +27 201
#note see, Collins is screwing me up. i think i had like 1 minute left on my clock after all that from how much harder Collins is that i couldn't think of NEWEL. (-5.5)

#note TE# is the "note below doh". um, i thought that was TI. also, doh is what homer says, and it's spelled d'oh.

#note an OU# is an "old man" in Afrikaans. wasn't 100% on it taking the S, because that's a dumb word, but luckily for me it did. +10 for SER too.

#note ANIGHT#/ANIGH# too. bleh. somehow i played hag instead of hog. it's all collins's fault.
