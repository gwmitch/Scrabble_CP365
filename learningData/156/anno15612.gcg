>Reid: ACHJOTU H4 THUJA +32 32
#note My play is #2 (56.67%). JUCO at 8G (56.70%) and THUJA at 8F (55.76%) are #1 and #3.
>Jim: PSUY 5E PUS.Y +26 26
>Reid: CDELOWW I7 OWL +23 55
#note #1 play.
>Jim: DEEI 6B EIDE +11 37
#note EIDE scores 17 at J8.
>Reid: CDEEMTW C3 MED.C +26 81
#note MEDIC is #6. DEW (62.61%) at 7C, DEMIC (62.46%) at C3, and WEE (61.40%) at J6 round out the top 3. WEE has a dangerous leave. DEMIC is a nice defensive play, and DEW may have a slightly better leave. I like DEMIC.
>Jim: EF D3 EF +24 61
>Reid: AELNTWZ J8 LAZE +41 122
#note LAZE (66.63%) is #4 because of the unfavorable W in the leave. WEN (68.34%), AWN (67.87%), and AWL (66.65%) at J6 are the top 3. I agree with Quackle, but I don't think this is a huge mistake.
>Jim: BEGINT 11E BEIGN.T +40 101
>Reid: ?ANOTWY 10D YAW +34 156
#note YAW (84.2%) is #2. NOWAY (84.36%) at 10B is #1 and WAY (84.02%) at 10D is #3. ATONY at 8A is tied for #2. I had seen the MEDIC hook when I played it but had forgotten it since then. I'm okay with my play here but NOWAY is better for tile turnover.
>Jim: AGO 8A AGO +23 124
>Reid: ??NORTT A8 .RNOTTos +71 227
#note My play is #8. aRNoTTO and aRNaTTO at 12B are #1 (93.47%) and #2 (93.44%) respectively. TRiTONs (92.65%) at 12A is #3. 
>Jim: DIP 12J DIP +29 153
>Reid: HIKLOTT M10 KITH +29 256
#note KITH (93.85%) is #2. oOLITH (94.77%) at 14A is #1 and KOHL (93.3.3%) at 2D is #3. I don't agree with Quackle here. I think my play has a better leave and position and the #1 play is not worth the 3 extra points.
>Jim: BI G3 BI. +10 163
>Reid: LNOORRT 12D ROT +17 273
#note ROTOR (96.24%) at 2D, ORLON (96.17%) at 2G, and ROOT (95.70%) at 12C are #1-3 respectively. I like ROOT the best of these choices; I think #1 and #2 are poorly positioned. Perhaps Quackle likes the tile turnover. My play is #11 based on valuations from all plays. I don't think my play is that bad.
>Jim: IU 13A .UI +6 169
>Reid: AELNORV H11 .ROVE +30 303
#note My play is #3 (99.01%). ROVEN (99.14%) at 14J is #1, and GLOVE (99.09%) is #2. I like GLOVE best because it keeps the R. The board is already open, so I don't think opening is that bad here. I think ROVEN is poorly positioned and gives easy access to a triple. I disagree with Quackle here.
>Jim: EINNRSS K2 SINNERS +71 240
>Reid: ACILMNQ J3 QI +24 327
#note My play is #6 (95.52%). QI at 2F (98.1%), PALM (95.88%) at L12, and MAUN (95.86%) at B11 are the top 3. This is probably my biggest mistake thus far. I didn't even see the BIS hook.
>Jim: ADO 7C .ODA +16 256
>Reid: ACELMNO 14J CAMEO +42 369
#note CAMEO is #6 (95.67%). MALE (96.67%), COLE (96.33%), and MACE (96.07%) at 14J are #1-3 respectively. My play creates an S hook, but I figured I could score enough to negate a bingo. I was a bit worried about the X. I think Quackle likes the leaves here and is willing to give up the 18 points to retain the vowel. I like my play here. I wasn't trying to balance, I was just going for points and my play is tied for highest scoring.
>Jim: AFLU 2K .ULFA +16 272
#note Jim opens the board.
>Reid: AELNNOR 1L NEON +31 400
#note According to Quackle 5-min chamiponship player NA (94.44%) at O1 is #1. NO at 15N (91.67%), DON at D6, NIT at 4F and UN at B13 are tied for #2. There are 9 plays tied for #3. ANION at G9 is a beauty in that group. Basically, Quackle is attracted to the powerful LOANER leave, especially since there is an S still out. I'm playing defensively here. My play is #1 based on valuations of all plays. I strongly disagree with Quackle here. Jim also has the last S, so fishing was probably not a wise strategy at this point.
>Jim: AEIRSVX O8 VARIXES +135 407
>Jim: AEIRSVX --  -135 272
>Reid: AEGLR 15C REGAL. +8 408
#note #2 play here based on valuations of championship choices. This is just a careless play. I had plenty of time on my clock. #1 is REGALE 6J.
>Reid:  (VARIXES) +34 442
#note 11 and possibly 12 of my 13 plays are in the top 10. 7 and possibly 8 of my plays are in the top 5. Only one true #1 play. No missed bingos this game. I was able to utilize some power tiles early and get the blanks early, so luck was on my side. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game.
