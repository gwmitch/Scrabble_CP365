#note Oops. Played this too fast, I know it's just S and R hooks on BONZE.
>Timothy_Anderson: LOT 7H TO.L +13 36
>Matthew_Larocque: BDELNOZ 9F BONED +33 49
#note Trying to squeeze more points next turn by keeping the Z, though his short hookable play could mean trouble.

#note Forgot about ALIYA but it's close.

>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILNQ J3 QI +14 130

>Timothy_Anderson: IMTTUU C7 TUMU.T +18 210
>Timothy_Anderson: IMTTUU --  -18 192
#note This wasn't a mistake - he really thought THA was a word. He was surprised when I challenged and more so when it was ruled invalid. Weird.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEIILO N5 OI +13 176
#note Missed a bunch of bingos, although sILICO(N)E is the only one I knew.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEIIS B12 I.E +10 222

>Timothy_Anderson: BO O1 BO. +15 307
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIORS 4J ..E. +10 306
#note Wasn't sure what to do, but ORGIES seemed like a pretty strong leave and bingos ending in IES/IER fit if the spot isn't blocked.
>Timothy_Anderson: Y H7 ...Y +16 323
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIJORS G13 JO. +18 324
#note Missed (K)OJIS but I still like this, bingos seem likely.

#note Or RIVAGES.

>Matthew_Larocque: NU 3F UN +12 473
#note Nu, duh, but I only had about 8 secs to get this down or else I'd go -30.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (N) +2 475
#note He lost -10, -20 for me. I underscored my total by 2.
