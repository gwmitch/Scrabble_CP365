#note This position is a nightmare. I'm open to any and all suggestions, but I'll just list a few of my thoughts:
I figured that Joel was unlikely to have the J after boas. I also didn't think there was much I could do about a bingo and I thought that joel was fairly likely to outrun me if I didn't draw my own bingo after zin M3 (not actually the case.) I also figured that if joel ended up having the J, he would be able to either make a big J play or a play like zoo/zoa, but not both, and I would be able to outrun him, and if he didn't have the J and didn't have a bingo, then I would outrun him anyways after he plays zoo/zoa. Thoughts anyone??? It seems like zin is the play here, as Joel and I discussed and acccording to the sim, but I'm not sure.
