#note A good start to my game against Jason. OUTGNaW is the only bingo in here.
>Jason_Li: III -III +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ANNTUZ 8F AZ.N +13 27
#note Not exactly sure what to do here. Speedy player says G6 ZA is the best equity play, followed by G4 TUNA. I think AZON is clearly better than ZONA, and probably better than ZA too. I don't think scoring 5 more points for a worse leave is a good idea right now.
>Jason_Li: ELRRSTT F7 R.TTLERS +62 62
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EINOTU 13F .OUTINEs +68 95
#note Yeah, I actually didn't think ELUTION was a word. Big mistake.
>Jason_Li: AEEIKT 11C TEA.IKE +22 84
#note I held this, since I'd never seen it.
>Joshua_Sokol: EILOOSS I7 O.O +15 110
#note I think OO(Z)E is the better option here, as there are two open Es on the board already. It's so many more points, but I was confident in bingoing next turn with my leave and I didn't look for anything else besides bingos. At least this time I didn't miss any.
>Jason_Li: DXY L12 D.XY +38 122
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNOSS J2 INSOLES +81 191
#note I missed LIONESS for two more.
>Jason_Li: ACRV D8 CAV.R +26 148
>Joshua_Sokol: BGHINRR H11 .R.BI +36 227
#note I liked that the I was open on J2, so GHNR is an even better leave here.
>Jason_Li: ?ACDEIN 5E CAtEN.ID +90 238
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGHNRS 2E FRESH.NG +67 294
#note I was 99% when I played this.
>Jason_Li: HMNP -  +0 238
#note Challenged! 
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIJLOR 1D JIAO +28 322
#note Now that I have a good lead, I start to really play paranoid. This is an interesting position, though, since GLORIA 1A scores the most and makes pretty sure I can come back from a deficit, all the while blocking his highest scoring bingo lane. I chose JIAO because of its blocking power and its score. GLORIA is just ahead of JIAO in the sim, and LARGO is following. I also considered LARGO but dismissed it because it opened lanes I would need to worry about in the future.
>Jason_Li: HMNP 15K N.MPH +45 283
>Joshua_Sokol: GILORUV 14L .U +13 335
#note Now to start the extreme paranoia. (s)U(M) is a really good play in terms of blocking high scores such as FA(X) or a bingo at M6, but not in terms of outscoring every time. I don't think many would agree that it's the correct play. The sim doesn't like my play, but then again it wants to play 4L IGLU, which I wouldn't do in a million years. GLUO(N) K9 looks good, as it accomplishes the same thing as SUM while scoring more and leaving better tiles. VUG(H) is an OK option too, as he might have AEROLIT(H) or something.
>Jason_Li: EFW 4F FEW +28 311
>Joshua_Sokol: GILORUV O12 VUG. +15 350
#note OK, another U. Now I can complete my blocking, even though I'm probably many times closer to catching AEROLIT(H) than he is. Sim still prefers GLUO(N). I think this should be best due to the off chance I draw the Q. GLUON blocks one of the spots for it.
>Jason_Li: AOPY 4J .OAPY +28 339
#note Jason said he debated SOAPY or SOAP here, setting up the case Y. He probably kept too many vowels to play SPAY in the same spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILOR 3L LOAD +29 379
#note I wasn't mad that I had an unplayable DARIOLE! I missed OARED 1K, which is simming much much better. I guess it's because of the vowely* pool. 
>Jason_Li: AEL 8A ALE. +18 357
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIIRU 2N BI +27 406
#note OK, here's the difficult decision. Jason disagrees with my play, since if I draw the Q he can't stick me with it. I didn't know that he couldn't, since maybe there's this weird 5 I don't know that starts with SIB or SEB that would block woth spots... I thought that I would be able to outscore by just scoring. The sim says RUBIES wins all the time, but not BURIES. BI is the only other 100% win, but it's apparently best. If I draw the Q I can score with it, and if not then I'll hopefully go out in two or score under QAIDS/QADIS.
>Jason_Li: ADEIQTT A6 TE.T +4 361
#note (B)ID and B(A)D 14H are better than TEAT? Why? I ended up beating him by less than what this claims I'll win by with BID/BAD.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIMRU 14B RIME. +14 420
>Jason_Li: ADIQ B3 QADI +20 381
>Jason_Li:  (EU) +4 385
#note Yay, 1-0 against Jason in tourneys. That shouldn't last long :P
