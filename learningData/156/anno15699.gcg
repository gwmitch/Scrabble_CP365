#note Quackle likes REI or AI those aren't really gone get me anywhere. The leaves aren't outstanding and the board is shitty, my play has a vowel heavy leave but it scores something and it opens up the board. I also considered that he may not know that micra takes no back hooks. (-8)

>Joey_Krafchick: ?ADENTT A2 DeNTATE +85 330
#note I saw that this was 15 points better than my next bingo, and that's a lot of points under my circumstance. And based on his open admission that he lacks word knowledge I can feel secure in that he won't know EDENTATE. It was a good risk i think.
>Siddarth_Murali: DENOR 13I DRONE. +26 352
#note Now I'm sure he doesn't know it.
>Joey_Krafchick: EFOPSUV K11 F..P +18 348
#note Championship player says play 1A EF, which wins 74% of the time, then my play is next at 68%. No way in hell I'm leaving OPSUV, but I was certain that I was leaving the U on my rack with the Q still out. 
>Siddarth_Murali: EQRU 13A QUER. +28 380
>Joey_Krafchick: EHOSUVZ J4 .OZ +34 382
#note That was a 2 tile draw I did not anticipate, I played FLOP to play on the 15 row for a lot, but I found a win anyway (considering he doens't know edentate)
>Siddarth_Murali: ELLLO B12 L.LL +8 388
#note ELL 1A wins for him.
