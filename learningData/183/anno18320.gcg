>Mack_: ABEKORR 8D KEBAR +32 32
#note Eschewed BREAK to avoid setting up extensions, and didn't think AR was 4 points better than OR as a leave, hence KEBAR over BROKE.

>Mack_: ILOSUWY D3 YOW +32 169
#note Didn't see OILWAY, but I am probably better off trying to stay within one bigno than allowing Joey to go up two bingos with a high scoring play after OILWAY. Quackle agrees, and this wins the sim by 2.5%.
>Joey: Q 10I Q. +22 251
>Mack_: FILSSTU H1 FLITS +28 197
#note (K)IS(T)FUL is a really cool play I didn't see. I'm not sure it's better, though, as I need to keep the board volatile.
>Joey: ADEER 4H .EARED +14 265
>Mack_: DHILSUX 2H .UX +26 223
#note D11 THUD to set up my X is a clever play I didn't consider, though I don't know if it is better since I need to bingo as soon as possible. Though I don't like closing down lanes with this play, I really have no other good choices.

>Mack_: ADNOORV 12A NOVA +20 291
#note At this point I definitely must bingo to win, so this looks good.
>Joey: CIMU N6 MU.IC +21 356
>Mack_: DEILORU C1 OUR +18 309
#note I liked this since it scores and dumps unwanted tiles, while also leaving me a chance to open the board with DIOL next turn.
