Although this is a whole lot crazier lol.

If you dont know what happened at Kings Cup, Nigel was leading slgihtly against Panupol and played ENATE as his 3rd last move, with the A right next to a triple square. A Z and ? were both unseen with just a few tiles left in the bag. Nigel was expecting Panupol who had been rack balancing to have a bingo and bingo through the only line available (ENATE blocked off a bingo line leaving just 1 left) leaving Nigel with the opportunity to come back by allowing him to score with the Z. If Panupol had the Z and Blank however, Nigel would have lost. But Nigel did draw BOTH the Z and blank from the bag and Panupol did not even have a bingo to play.

I feel like i am making a big fuss out of the TAV play for nothing tho so just carry on.

#note Setting up for TOEA as i was told. A bit risky play nonetheless. Opponent might have a bingo given his fishing for the past few turns. Only 1 D left though so i can understand why Andy played that. At the same time, OE at 14J looks strong, blokcing off the last easy bingo line. JA is the last bingo line but thats a bit hard to pull off. It will force Jing En to open up another line.
