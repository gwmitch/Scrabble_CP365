>Mack_: CDFFILS H8 CLIFF +34 34
#note I wonder if I should have played this at H4 instead to avoid setting up CLIFFIER. I actually thought CLIFFING* was valid, so that would even suggest that H4 is more superior. This does keep the board tighter and set up my S nicely though, so it is probably worth allowing CLIFFIER. Quackle likes H8 as well.

>Mack_: ADHKRRS 10J HARK +41 75
>Matt: BOT 9G B.OT +16 44
>Mack_: ADEORRS 13B ADORERS +82 157
#note While DROSERA is much more defensive, I think 8 points is too much to sacrifice this early on. Quackle concurs, with ADORERS winning the sim by 1%.
>Matt: LNOP B10 NOP.L +18 62
>Mack_: ?BIJOTY 12D JOB +48 205
#note For only three points less, I liked JOB over JOY to keep a better leave and set up my Y.
>Matt: HNT E10 TH..N +16 78
>Mack_: ?AIMTUY 8B UlTIMA.Y +74 279
#note Only bingo.
>Matt: ADENRTU C1 DENTURA. +68 146

>Matt: ?AEEIIT 1B I.EATIvE +77 223
>Mack_: AEGOSVV 15E SOAVE +33 376
#note This looks fine, as it scores, turns over tiles, and blocks the highest scoring lane. K3 VAVS may be a tad better to unload both Vs, but I wasn't positive RENEGADO took an S (thought it might only be ES).
>Matt: ER 12K ER +14 237
>Mack_: GGINOOV 4A VO.ING +28 404
>Matt: AEIQRU M7 QUA.IER +65 302
>Mack_: CGIOSUW 5J WIG +19 423
#note Missed 14A CLOWN, which is probably a bit better, but at this point the odds of Matt coming back to win are virtually zero regardless of which play I make.
>Matt: ELP 8L P.LE +27 329
>Mack_: ACOSSUZ 14I AZO +34 457
#note I didn't see any possibilites for sevens or eights through the E (2I NIMIETY, which I overlooked, is the only one), and knew that this was enough to win even if I missed one so I went for it.
