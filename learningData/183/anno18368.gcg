>Joel_Horn: AIIO J6 OI.IA +10 10
>Morris: DINOTTT K4 TINT.D +21 89
#note TOITED instead, missed that.
>Joel_Horn: KOO 4I KO.O +16 26
>Morris: AEMOSTU F8 .OU +5 94
#note Wasn't 100% on SUMO same spot, that's a bit better. Missed OAKUM.
>Joel_Horn: AF 5H FA +11 37
>Morris: AEFLMST 11E FLAME +24 118
#note Whoa, AELMST is a really strong leave, so Quackle digs KAF I4, or OF L4. Also, FLAM is better than this in the same spot.
>Joel_Horn: AEILOST M7 ISOLATE +77 114
>Morris: DEEIRST 12C DIESTER +87 205
>Joel_Horn: ?EEGNSU 3C dENGUES +76 190
>Morris: AEEINRW 6F WAE +19 224
#note Missed the KOTO->KOTOW hook, so didn't see AWE there for 5 more. Sim likes L12 AWE even more than both, but I didn't want to telegraph I had a precious E to Joel :)
>Joel_Horn: AQ 12K QA. +24 214
>Morris: EIINORX 4C OX +37 261
#note Was choosing between this and NIX(E). I ultimately chose the points, sim slightly prefers NIXE though.
>Joel_Horn: BERW B4 BREW +23 237
#note BREW/KOTOW, but it turned out well for Joel.
>Morris: EGIINNR 14G GINNIER +68 329
>Morris: EGIINNR --  -68 261
#note ....yeah, I should really learn my top 100 8s. And the next 100, and the next 100, and the next 100, and the...
>Joel_Horn: BCGJV -BCGJV +0 237
#note Joel said he had 7 consonants and exchanged 5.
>Morris: EGIINNR H11 ..RIN +21 282
>Morris: EGIINNR --  -21 261
#note I realized after it getting challenged someone played this at club once against me and I challenged it off, and that's where I remember seeing it. Oh how the mighty have fallen.
>Joel_Horn: PZ L11 Z.P +29 266
>Morris: EGIINNR 13J RI..N +18 279
#note The one nice thing about phonying twice is your opponent can give you more options. GRIPE 13I is also a strong play here.
>Joel_Horn: BCPV -BCPV +0 266
#note All consonants again.
>Morris: AEGINOU A7 AGIO +20 299
#note Quackle seriously loves GUI(D)ON, almost 6% more than any other play. I think it's a very strong play, but I don't see why it is incredible compared to the rest. Is the D a large threat for bingoing? The play I know like a lot is GENU 13B, cleverly blocking both bingo lanes. It's a 22:6 consonant to vowel ratio of unseen, and Joel seems to have been throwing back consonants, so I should be fine with the 3 vowel leave. This sims 3rd after GUIDON and GENU.
>Joel_Horn: BY H1 BY. +24 290
>Morris: DEHINUV 2B DUH +29 328
#note Maybe 14M DUH for two less to block the RIPENs hook with the blank, and block a key scoring spot? VEND 13B is also a nice way to block, though the leave is so much worse that I still prefer DUH.
>Joel_Horn: HR 9D RH. +6 296
>Morris: EIINPVV 14G VIVE +16 344
#note I didn't love anything here, and seriously considered trading 7. With VIVE, I need to hope he can't bingo this turn so I can block next turn. Quackle likes VIVE best, then NIP N9, then exchanging 7, I think I agree with those 3 as the best three, and the order too, though not sure at all.
>Joel_Horn: CGO 15J COG +13 309
>Morris: IJLNPUY N5 JUN +14 358
#note Best according to Quackle, it wins 7/8 of the time, when he can't bingo through the B up top (with something like BALaNCER/BARNaCLE).
>Joel_Horn: ?AELNRT 15J ...ENT +27 336
#note Joel went more than 3 minutes overtime here, I don't blame him, he needs the bingo to win. Only ones in ABELNRT? are TURNABLE and RENTABLE, which don't fit here. When I saw he had AELNRT? as his final tiles I was sad at first, but quickly realized how evil a rack this must have been for Joel.
>Morris: CILMPRY N9 YIP +33 391
>Joel_Horn: ?ALR 3L LARs +8 344
#note (ME)R(I)t, to block MELIC.
