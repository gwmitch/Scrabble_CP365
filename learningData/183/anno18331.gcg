#note I THINK this is the rack i saw that he wrote down, i could have copied it wrongly, idk. But yeah this rack has DIAZOLE so i assume it was wrong.

#note INDAGATE. The D persisting on the rack for so long just kinda makes me think he did really have DIAZOLE on his first rack. The only letter the D could pose as is the O which is not in this rack. An interesting play here is GAZANIA but it leaves the E a bit too open for comfort. NAIAD is preferred.

>Jeya: EIIORSU C9 .URIO +14 255
#note 6H SERIOUS is the best attempt Jeya can make here to close off the board. Sure it still allows Jian Rong to bingo, but Jeya will atleast be able to take control after that. Unfortunately there is really no move that can completely shut down all the bingo lines availalbe here. (The G and L in tollgate, WIFEYS and the R of resalute. CURIO doesnt really do much for blocking though.

>Jian_Rong: ?BEGILN 12B L.B +10 200
#note L3 BEAGLING.
I can see the reason for playing EH over BHAGEE and that is because u can hold the n to play something-ING using the G in tollgate.
LIB is still a good play, because the only tiles that can even go there are the lone F and ? left.
>Jeya: EIIMOPS B10 MO. +23 278
#note Kinda why i think CURIO wasnt the best play. Now Jian Rong has access to the triple line. Best bet to block off the triple line is to play MOOI/LO. Jian Rong will proceed to likely just bingo elsewhere and Jeya like i said before can control the situation from there.
>Jian_Rong: ?EGINRU A9 dUNGIER +94 294
#note GUNGIER is also valid
>Jeya: EIIPSTV 14C SPIV +25 303
#note Might be better off playing VIG and hoping to draw a bingo because Jeya is at a bad position now. Trying to block 5 or more lines before opponent gets a bingo might be a tad slow i think. You also want a response ready in case of a bingo.

#note Jian Rong said he did not want to risk WIFEYS
>Jeya: EINOTWY I5 .EW +28 354
#note Only open tile left is the L but with only one A left, its not a likely hotspot.
>Jian_Rong: ?EENOST J5 SON +35 370
>Jian_Rong: ?ADEEOT (challenge) +5 375
#note Kinda forced to just play WIFEYS now and it is indeed valid. It's just a noun anyway.
>Jeya: EEINOTY K7 YE +15 369
#note Cant help but think how the game might have been different had Jeya played VIG.
>Jian_Rong: ?ADEEOT E3 D.. +7 382
#note No As left. This is unblockable.
>Jeya: EEINORT D12 .O. +9 378
#note I think AXE or dumping OE or ET somewhere might be better. High chance to pick another E or T looking at the remaining tiles. Might have been going for TEENIER or NETTIER by throwing the O maybe. Yeah actually in that case BOP is the best play.
>Jian_Rong: ?AEEKOT 8J E.K +16 398
>Jeya: EEINRRT N13 ..E +10 388
#note I didnt know the tile he picked up so this rack may not be accurate but if he had a bingo, he should just pass..ACTUALLY WAIT NO... Definitely not a good idea ro pass because by doing so you are saying "HAHAHAHA I HAVE A BINGO! GO BINGO NOW AND I WILL DESTROY YOU HAHAHA". Yeah.. so Jian Rong will just pass right back. Probably not the best idea to dump an E though. Jian Rong clearly has the other E since he dumped one. Throw the R by playing RORE. You want that game-winning 2 Es on your rack at all times.
>Jian_Rong: ?ACEOTT 2D CAlOTTE +68 466
#note ATTONCE guarantees the win since a counter bingo is impossible. 
>Jeya: EINRRST 1H SERIN +28 416
#note at this point, just play one tile at a time to maximize score. Jian Rong is stuck with the J.
>Jian_Rong: J -  +0 466
>Jeya: RT E13 R.T +6 422
#note Jian Rong wins despite making countless mistakes in the early game. I know i said that Scrabble can be unforgiving to you when you make mistakes (see the game before this), but no matter what just keep fighting til the end. It aint over til its over.
