>Jim_Burlant: AGLQRRT 8G QAT +24 24
#note It helps to pay attention to what you're doing.  My rack was AGLNQRT when I overdrew an 8th tile.  I lost the N on the overdraw and, instead of playing off TRANQ for 48 and leaving myself only 1 R, I had to play this for 24 and leave duplicated R's.  Just for yuks I ran a sim, and believe it or not, this isn't an instant winner - at 500 iterations this is only the most marginal of winners.  Exchanging GLQR leaving ART sims identically well in the duck's eyes.  I figured that 24 points was enough that I had to grind through.  Regardless of what's truly right here, I caught a break shortly:
>Pat_Barrett: EELNOPS I4 PELE.ONS +62 62
>Pat_Barrett: EELNOPS --  -62 0
#note The word Pat was thinking of was PELOTONS.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGLRRY H6 GR.Y +8 32
#note The only thing I saw was RANGERLY* which looked bogus to me and didn't seem worth risking it.  Turns out the only 8's in this rack are GRILLERY and ERRINGLY, neither of which play.  I don't have any great options and Quackle more or less agrees with me:  my best play is to simply dump the rack.  I probably should have played GLARY for the extra point but the difference in the sim is splitting hairs.  
>Pat_Barrett: EELNOPS 6F PE. +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEILNR I8 .ENDRILs +66 98
#note It's either this or 7H REDLINER for 63, and no matter how I slice it I have to slot the triple so I might as well take the points.
>Pat_Barrett: EILNOOS J2 LOONIES +74 86
#note Pat's other options are EIDOLONS/SOLENOID on row 11 for 68; this scores 74 and is her best bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDEENT 12D CeNTE.ED +72 170
#note Ok, I didn't know DECEDENT which scores 94 on the 2x2 so I'll give myself a pass for missing that.  However, can someone please explain to me how I can't find DEsCENTS on row 15 when I see SCENTED (it's anagram) as a no-go 7?!?!?  This is awful!!!!!!
>Pat_Barrett: ACEHIN 15D CHAIN. +39 125
#note Pat flashed the E before putting this down.  Play incorrectly scored as 42.
>Jim_Burlant: AIRSUVZ 14F ZA +64 234
>Pat_Barrett: AEUX 11K EAUX +28 153
>Jim_Burlant: GIIRSUV 3G VIG.URS +34 268
#note  I figured that if she didn't have something like REIF  at H1, it wasn't worth giving up 12 scoreboard points to hold my S with VIGOUR on row 4; the thought of setting up an S hook with VIGOUR didn't occur to me. This does win the sim by the slimmest of margins, but the difference is practically negligible; it's a matter of stylistic preference as to whether to play VIGOUR for 22 or VIGOURS for 34 in Quackle's eyes.
>Pat_Barrett: AEHIORT M7 THIO.REA +76 229
>Jim_Burlant: IIOOUVW L2 V.OUW +22 290
#note 5E VOW socres 27 to this play's 22, but the IIOU leave is *so* horrible that it's definitely worth giving up the scoreboard points to unload the U.   Also - VOW opens up the A hook, and I don't want to give her any more easy lanes than I absolutely have to, especially if I have to keep that much garbage.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Pat_Barrett: IKS 8L K.IS +48 277
>Jim_Burlant: FIIILOT D8 FOLI. +14 304
#note Besides the CENTERED misfire, this is about the only real mistake I made while this game was still up for grabs.  I don't have any great options, but these same tiles score 18 at 5C and don't give back easy plays at 8A and don't open up a line for easy 7's.  Fortunately I don't get burned.
>Pat_Barrett: EMOW 5D MEOW +27 304
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIINT O1 ADENITI. +80 384
#note Or DAINTIES in the same location.  95% to win.
>Pat_Barrett: AENO 4B AEON +18 322
>Jim_Burlant: BDEFJPU 8A BUF. +36 420
#note Any number of strong choices available, but apparently I should play JIBE or JIB 11C so as to not open up a possible BEGROANS 8A.
>Pat_Barrett: AMY 3B YAM +32 354
>Jim_Burlant: BDEJLPT 10B JE.L +27 447
>Pat_Barrett: AEGORRS B10 .AGER +26 380
>Jim_Burlant: BDPTT 13A B.D +12 459
#note Missing BAP 14L
>Pat_Barrett: ORS 2A ORS +21 401
#note Final score recorded as 459 - 414.  Outside of a horrible bingo choice  on CENTERED, I'm otherwise pretty happy with how I played this one.
>Pat_Barrett:  (PTT) +10 411
