#note Marlon grimaced as he missed unifying. Also i think MID might be better then MIND as it preserves the ING on your rack.

>Marlon: AIIILLU 6B ILIA +10 410
#note One of those situations where you should change 7. All the tiles left are good to pick!
>Li_Wei: ??AORUZ 6L .UZO +33 353
#note If you dont want to open for Marlon to score, then options like I11 ZOA exist. There are still atleast 2 lines open. OUZO will however force Marlon to empty the bag allowing Li Wei to out with a bingo. AND the interesting thing is that no matter what, Li Wei will win if he can bingo UNLESS Marlon plays WOXEN. Safest move is to play ZOA but it will be difficult to bingo if Li Wei picks up the X because he has XU on his rack. So i guess ultimately just play OUZO and hope Marlon does not have WXEN in his 7 tiles. (Odds are actually rather low that he does because if he had the X or W he would have scored with it by now.) He literally has to draw it off off his ILIA play. This is also where changing 7 might have been good for Marlon. He will get both the X and W likely and be able to score enough to prevent Li Wei from winning.

#note Quackle actually gave Marlon WEXO from the bag! Too close for comfort lol.

Marlon used Growl!
Li Wei's attack fell!
>Li_Wei: ??ANORX A1 ANOXic +61 414
#note SARDONYX and ANOREXY are the winning moves here.

Marlon used Growl!
Li Wei's attack fell!
Li Wei could not spot ANOREXY!

Not mere coincidence no?

A bit hard to see i guess although u can just go through all the common X words starting with A or O or E to see if any fit your rack.
