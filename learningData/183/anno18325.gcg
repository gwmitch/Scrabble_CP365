#note Knew this was phoney when I played it, but I didn't see any good options. Had I seen D10 DIET faster I would have played that, but I played this really quickly in hopes that it would make it more believable.

#note Setting up the T. I don't think he knows that hook. Q wants me to play recklessly open here with (Z)IT or (K)I.

#note I saw (G)A(Z)OO, but didn't like giving Trevor free points while holding junky stuff, so I decided to invent a word instead.

#note I was going through alphagrams with the blank as each letter. I stopped when I got to AEEHISST because it looked familiar, then though "no matt, that's HESITATE" and moved on. No matt, that's ESTHESIA. :(

#note Ugh, not the time to draw bingo stuff. Trevor played NOVA very quickly, which means he didn't have the H for 2F. On a junky board like this, that spot may be really big. Q really likes NU(BI)A for 20 here.

#note LIPIN is way better here, but I didn't remember that word. I'm playing so poorly this game...
