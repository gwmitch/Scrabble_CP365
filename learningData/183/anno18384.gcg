#note But whoa! There's the blank on the one-tile pull. I have two bingos here, both 9s from (IN): INFECTACT and INJECTANT. INJECTANT takes an S and INFECTANT doesn't. I'm not going to pretend like I knew that, but I was going to challenge INFECTANTS* if she played it.

This was my second straight autopilot game- got lucky at the beginning, had predominantly easy racks. I didn't make a mistake, but I didn't have to think much either. (that's not meant as a shot to my opponents at all- some racks just don't require much thinking, and I've had tons of those this tournament). Blank count: 3 of 4.
