>Mack_: AIPRRUZ I6 PU.Z +26 26
#note Also considered 7H PURI, but didn't think the Z had a very bright future on this board, so elected to play it now. Quackle agrees.

>Mack_: AIRRRTW 4I W.RRIT +18 44
>Jan: AEU 3L EAU +14 54
>Mack_: ?AIORSW O4 SOWAR +38 82
#note I looked for a while, but no bingo plays. 
>Jan: EER 5J .EER +24 78
>Mack_: ?AEINRS K8 SNAkIER +74 156
#note 3C REtSINA was another alternative, but the board seemed easier to close down after SNAkIER with plays such as parallel plays down the L column.
>Jan: CEIORTX 2F XEROTIC +90 168
>Mack_: DGGOSTU 1G DOG +27 183
>Jan: IMNU 3C MUNI +21 189
>Mack_: GNNSTTU 12F STUNT.NG +70 253
#note This is harder to underlap than NUTTINGS, which I wasn't 100% on anyway, so this is clearly the play. TUNGSTEN, which I also saw, is available, but clearly inferior.
>Jan: AHL D1 HA.L +22 211
>Mack_: ?AEIILN 13B ExILIAN +71 324
#note Luckbox. This is the highest scoring bingo by three points.

>Jan: BEFI 14J B.IEF +32 315
>Mack_: ACEFGOV 14D FACE +36 400
#note This pretty much seals the game, as I will be up 85 on a board completely bereft of bingo lines. I saw FOVEA but plased it up since it leaves the I open for a potential bingo.
