#note I see MESHLIKE*, HOMELIKE, and HEMPLIKE. I figured HEMPLIKE had the best shot at being good, then HOMELIKE, the MESHLIKE, but MESHLIKE scored the most so I did it. 

It's funny. After the abysmal early bird, I told Jackson my first rack would either be 7 vowels or a bingo, and that would dictate how the tournament went for me. And it turned out to be a 110 point (phoney) bingo!

#note This creates the long-term board shape I want the most. It's going to be very hard to access the bottom or right side of the board now.

#note I guess his last play should indicate a bingo-prone leave sometimes. Maybe I should play BA(R)N B11 and close, although most bingo racks will also play at 14F.
