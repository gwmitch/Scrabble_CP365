>Matt_Canik: AEINOOR 8H OORIE +12 12
#note While a sim prefers exchanging OO here, I think it's worth the equity loss here to play a less volatile game against a lower-rated opponent.

#note Setting up a hook that he likely doesn't know. 
>Trevor_Sealy: RTTUY L1 RUTTY +23 78
>Matt_Canik: ADDELSU O10 SADDLE +41 167
#note Holding a U for UNSADDLE too? Cool! Things are going my way.

#note PECULAT(E), damn. Really didn't think this was a word but it was so much better than the options I saw.

#note This or (Z)OEA? Q likes this.

>Matt_Canik: EIMNOPQ 3C POM +23 253
#note I have the penultimate E. That could be huge in this game. (RAZOR)ING will also decide this game a decent amount of the time. Should I turn more over to try and draw a G? Should I keep the E? 

Q says I should put the E down, and it's not even close.

>Trevor_Sealy: AGSY 5D SAGY +24 299
#note Aaaaand this isn't good. Suddenly two Gs are gone and I still don't have RAZORING. But that's fine, I probably won't *need* it to win this game...

#note Trevor was looking at this E eagerly. Maybe it's just paranoia that caused me to block it. 
>Trevor_Sealy: GIN 1H .....ING +54 362
#note And that's the game. 
>Matt_Canik: EHILNOS N3 NOSH +35 364
#note Nothing here wins. HOLIES and HELIOS are both words that play at 15A but just give him FISH at N3.
