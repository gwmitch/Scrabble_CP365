>Jim_Burlant: CEEFNNP 8D FENCE +28 28
#note Reasonable play, but not best.  Better would have been a 6-letter word I didn't know, FENNEC, in the same place for 2 more points.
>Kristina_Simon: EKOR I6 KORE +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: BGLNOPZ E4 BONZ. +32 60
#note I debated between this and GLOZE E4 and chose this because it didn't give up easy plays if he had AW/OX/etc in his rack.  Three plays stand out at the top of the sim:  ZONK 6F (believe it or not, never saw it due to the clunk overload), E7 BENZOL (didn't recognize it), and this.    BENZOL wins the sim at 56%, and this is a very close 3rd place, rouhly 1 point down, winning roughly 3/4% less often than BENZOL.
>Kristina_Simon: EIV 4C VI.E +18 39
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGLLP D8 .LAGPoLE +78 138
#note The only other bingo is 3F PILLAGE 64; this scores 78 and is clearly best.  82% to win in a short sim.
>Kristina_Simon: AEENOSU 3F AENEOUS +61 100
#note This or 12B EUPNOEAS are Kristina's only bingoes and this gets the nod in the sim.  She's 22% to win.  
>Jim_Burlant: ADGNRRW 15A WAD.R +27 165
#note FAIL. No, I don't have bingoes here but I need to look for my best play and not be paranoid about an E in the 3x3 when she's just drawn 7 random tiles.  This is an okay choice given the pool and its 8 unseen I's, but I need to do something about row 2 threats if I can score there.  All I saw there was 2C DRAWN which (a) left the 3x3 open and (b) left me with the dreaded N-less G.  Hence, this.  While the sim confirms this is a better choice than 2C DRAWN for the reasons I just delineated, it's still mid-pack at best, as I flat-out whiffed on the best play:  2F WRANG scores 48 and more or less neutralizes row 2.  Between my failure to address row 2 on this turn, my falling asleep at the switch on her next turn, and my subsequent rack issues, this game turns around and I start struggling.  I'm still 75% to win. but not for long.  2F WRANG wins 80.
>Kristina_Simon: OUY 2J YOU +31 131
#note Asleep at the switch.  When you spend a month only playing Quackle, Words-With-Friends, and Facebook Scrabble it's easy to get into the habit of not paying attention to the words your opponent is playing because you can't play phonies in those games, so you never have to worry about whether the play is acceptable.  All I saw was that Kristina was playing the Y on the triple letter in two directions and I didn't notice OU* until about 10 seconds after she'd drawn tiles, so the play stuck.  
>Jim_Burlant: GINRRTX K1 T..RING +16 181
#note As for this - no good options are available so I figured I should just dump the rack and defend against an easy 4-letter M word at 1L.  And Kristina might not know the S back hook to TOURING, so that was another reason.  Q says taking out K1 was correct, but that I should have just dumped the X for cheap with ROUX K1.  I can sort of see that, but if I don't draw a vowel, the open vowels on rows 10 and 13 might not be much help with my GINRT leave.  Maybe I can score big with the X on the next turn?
>Kristina_Simon: AEHNT 2B NEATH +46 177
>Jim_Burlant: FINRRTX 1D FIT +28 209
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  1A RIFT  (which I never saw) would have been a little better if I was worried about row 1.  That said, given that the bag was down to 1 R, I wasn't too worried about keeping duplicated R's.
>Kristina_Simon: IWY H1 WI.Y +42 219
>Jim_Burlant: AIMNRRX 1A XI +29 238
#note It's either this or 6C MINX.  I chose this because I thought I might be able to do something with the M at 14B on the next turn.  48% to win.
>Kristina_Simon: IQ J5 QI +33 252
>Jim_Burlant: AIMNRRU B10 MARIN. +28 266
#note I never recognized the 7 in this rack.  MURRAIN plays at J9 for 67.  If you miss the bingo like I did, this is the next best option.
>Kristina_Simon: BDEL 6B BLE.D +18 270
>Jim_Burlant: AAJLRSU A7 JURA +37 303
#note I debated between this and JURAL in the same location for 5 more.  I opted to hold the L because I felt the pool was too depleted of bingo prone consonants (only one R, no N's, no L's unseen) to play it off.  It takes a while for the sim to sort itself out, but Quackle agrees with this choice, as it's slightly better than JURAL.  Despite my bumbling, I'm at 70% to win.
>Kristina_Simon: AGO E10 GOA +21 291
>Jim_Burlant: AADLMOS 8K SALAD +30 333
#note I never saw the sim winners here (L1 DOMAL/DOLMA) and anything else that scored required me to burn the S.  My smarter half had me fixated on plays like SALAD F10 and ALMAS F11.  Then, the cartoon devil got over my shoulder and told me that if I had to burn the S, I might as well max out the points and, hey, I might get a challenge if I put the S on TOURING.  So I opted to listen to the cartoon devil.  This is still 60% to win...but not for long.
>Kristina_Simon: ?CEESUV O8 .ECUrVES +89 380
#note Nice find!
>Jim_Burlant: HIMOOPS -  +0 333
#note No R available for ISOMORPH, and I never saw OOMPHS F10 50, which is my only winning play.   So I desperation challenged since I didn't see how I could win if I let this stick.  If I find OOMPHS for 50 I probably win going away since she probably desperation challenges.  Instead, I throw the game away.  
Note to self:  STOP DOING THAT!!!!
