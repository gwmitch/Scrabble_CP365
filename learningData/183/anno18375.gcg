>Morris: ABBKOOP 8D KABOB +36 36
>Mack_Meller: AACDINO D8 .AONIC +24 24
#note MM: Aargh, missed 9D ANODIC, which is clearly better and sims 2% ahead.
>Morris: LNOPRRU E5 ULN.R +12 48
#note MG: A lot of close plays here, Quackle likes UPRO(A)R a bit better, but this is within 1% according to the sim. 
>Mack_Meller: ADDFTTU 7G DAFT +23 47
>Morris: EFHOPRV 13A POR.H +24 72
#note MG: FOE 6H is an interesting option here, as HPRV does have some synergy.
>Mack_Meller: DEOPRTU A11 UP.ED +39 86
#note MM: Or TUPPED, but I wanted to keep the better leave and try for a bingo as soon as possible.
>Morris: EFIMNRV D1 VIMEN +30 102
#note MG: FERMI(O)N B8 scores a whopping 40, but also gives back a ton. This is better.
>Mack_Meller: EEORTTY C2 TOY +27 113
>Morris: ADFINRU F2 FAUN +18 120
#note MG: F(AR)INA 9C is a really nice play I completely missed. Another interesting play is B13 (O)F, as ADINRU makes a surprising amount of bingos.
>Mack_Meller: DEEMQRT -QD +0 113
#note MM: Static hates this and likes B9 METEOR, but this rockets to the top of the sim.
>Morris: ADEEIIR 6H DIE +21 141
>Mack_Meller: AEEIMRT 15A .IAMETER +92 205
>Morris: ?AAEIRS 14H ARIStAE +68 209
#note MG: According to the Quackle sim, this is second best, after SpIRAEA B3.
>Mack_Meller: CGHIIOT 15M GHI +29 234
#note MM: Was about to play 5J GOTHIC then saw this, which is clearly better.
>Morris: EEJRSVZ 5J JEEZ +50 259
#note MG: Lucky Mack didn't play GOTHIC last turn.
>Mack_Meller: CILNOTT M3 CO. +28 262
#note MM: 9C TAROC is better to unduplicate my T's.
>Morris: EGRRSVW 4L W.VE +32 291
#note MG: W(O)G is a lot better in the same spot.
>Mack_Meller: AILNOTT 13I ALOIN +28 290
#note MM: This seemed like too many points to forgo. Another advantage of ALOIN is that it turns over more tiles for the blank. Quackle prefers 10A TO by 7%, but this still looks fine to me.
>Morris: DGRRSUW B3 DRUG +22 313
#note MG: Maybe URG(E)D instead? Since Mack got rid of 5 1 pointers last turn I thought he was keeping 2 one pointers and I should block the 7 bingo lane instead of E bingo lane. It's pretty close according to Quackle, I think I like URGED more now though.
>Mack_Meller: ?IIQTTX O1 QuI.T +39 329
#note MM: My choices here were QuIET, change QXIT, and postmortem I thought of EXIsT/EXITsto set up the Q. After QuIET, I will be in good shape if Morris does not have QUIETEST/QUIETERS/QUIETENS, as I am quite likely to pick up QUIETIST. My bingo percentage after exchanging is a whopping 67% though. The Q setup of EXIsT looks hard to block, but it is a fairly strange play and will probably draw ared flag and prompt Morris to block, after which I will be in serious trouble.This play is definitely a really tough call, and the main factors to considerare definitely my bingo percentage after exchanging, Morris's likelihood of having an extension to QuIET, and his likelihood of blocking the Q setup. In hindsight I think I like exchanging, but I'm definitely not sure.
>Morris: ENORSWY O1 .....ERS +48 361
#note MG: Definitely lucked out here, I am over 70% to win now according to Quackle sim.
>Mack_Meller: AEILLTX G1 LAX +40 369
#note MM: This looks OK, as AX gives back too much. LEX may actually be a tad better since there is an E but no A out.
>Morris: GNOSTWY B8 GOWN +18 379
#note MG: Whoa, WOGS in the same spot followed by TYN(E) 6L or N(O)T(AR)Y 9A nets 1 more point if Mack plays it right!
>Mack_Meller: EEILOST H1 OSE +31 400
#note MM: Nothing wins.
>Morris: STY 8J STY +21 400
#note MG: Good game on both ends, though I definitely had the more fortunate draw.
>Morris:  (EILT) +8 408
