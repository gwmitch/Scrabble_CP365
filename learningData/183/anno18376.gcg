>Morris: AAEQTTU 8G QUA +24 24
#note HAHAHAHA, I was putting down QUATE, then I convinced myself I was making it up. Yeah, my word knowledge is shaky sometimes. 
>Jan_Cardia: EGOUV J6 VOGUE +33 33
>Morris: AEEEMTT K10 METE +16 40
>Jan_Cardia: EGNW 13G NGWE. +14 47
>Morris: ADEORRT H13 .OR +12 52
#note I was choosing between (G)OR and DREAR 14J, Quackle sim agrees that the fish is a bit better, but likes AR(G)OT H11 even more! I didn't even think of it.
>Jan_Cardia: OWY 12K .OWY +20 67
>Morris: AAADERT M11 A.A +12 64
>Jan_Cardia: ACY 6H CA.Y +12 79
>Morris: ?ADERRT 11D pRETRAD. +77 141
>Morris: ?ADERRT --  -77 64
#note Missed mART(Y)RED N8, (R)ETARDeR 15H, and fRA(C)T(U)RED H3.
>Jan_Cardia: FIO G10 FOI. +7 86
>Morris: ?ADERRT 11A pREDAT.R +66 130
#note Still missing the same higher point bingos. Jan was a bit at herself after I played this.
>Jan_Cardia: AEILT H1 ATELI. +27 113
>Morris: CGHLOTV C10 V.TCH +26 156
#note I want a K now, but I won't kvetch about it too much if I don't land it.
>Jan_Cardia: ALP 5K ALP +20 133
#note Jan spent a really long time on this turn, she had about 5 minutes left when she hit her clock I think.
>Morris: EGHIJLO 2F JO. +26 182
#note I start playing a bit faster from here on out because of the time thing.
>Jan_Cardia: NSSSU 14B S.UNS +20 153
#note Wow.
>Morris: EGHIILO 14H .OH +32 214
#note I was choosing between (O)OH and HELIO 3B. Quackle likes HELIO a lot more. I chose this because it's safer.
>Jan_Cardia: BIS 15A BI +14 167
>Morris: ?EGIILR M2 GRI. +14 228
#note I was playing too fast at this point, I missed REmIGI(A)L E5, G(A)InLIER 1G, and REdI(A)LI(N)G E7. Jan had under 3 minutes left, but I should still be more careful.
>Jan_Cardia: DEIN 2J DIN.E +22 189
>Morris: ?EILNTU 4C LUTEo.IN +64 292
#note dILUENT O2. This is a large mistake, though it will be hard for Jan to bingo twice to come back now. Something like REXINES/DINGERS would hurt though now.
>Jan_Cardia: DEI L8 DIE +11 200
>Morris: ADEIRRZ O1 IRADE +32 324
#note I missed ADZE or ADZ in the same spot, Jan had under 1 minute. I chose this over (D)AZE 8L because DAZE gives her bingoes sometimes. However, I did not consider the 12:6 consonant heavy tile pool when I played this, that was a bit of a mistake. All of these plays are over 99.5 to win though according to a many ply Quackle sim.
>Jan_Cardia: INX 5D NIX +35 235
#note Hit her clock with 00:00.
>Morris: BMOORTZ A7 TROM. +18 342
>Jan_Cardia: AEEKLSS 9A .AKS +36 271
#note KA(Y)LES N10 is a word I did not know, but scores 65!?!?!?!?
>Morris: BFNOPZ 1H .ZO +15 357
#note K1 F(I)Z
>Jan_Cardia: EELS 3A LEES +15 286
#note Jan ended with -00:59 seconds, so she lost 10 points. I played this game very sloppily, I could have easily won it by 100. I am lucky that I still won with the mistakes I made.
