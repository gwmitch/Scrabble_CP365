>Hubert: AOV 8F AVO +12 12
#note He played so fast i couldnt catch his rack! lol
>Jeremy: EEFILMN F3 FILEN.ME +67 67
#note Nice
>Hubert: AACDRST 11B CARDS +30 42
>Jeremy: GIOOQTY G1 TOYO +25 92
#note GOOFY perhaps? Looks much better then TOYO.
>Hubert: AADNPTU 1B DUPAT.A +39 81
>Jeremy: EGILOQS 2A QI +28 120
>Hubert: EEENOSY 3B EYE +16 97
#note Hubert should really consider playing poker. 4 Es in another game, 4 Is in another game and 3 Es in this one. Could have played 3B EYE or D1 PEEOY perhaps though..
>Jeremy: BEGLOOS 6B GLOB. +12 132
#note Jeremy overdrew this turn. Hubert exposed LOB and returned the L, giving Jeremy a bingo.
He arranged GLOBOSE on his rack but i guess he wasnt sure of it. It is indeed valid.
OBOL/DIEB seems much better then throwing GLOBE though...

>Jeremy: AAHOSTW J4 AAH +31 197
#note Pleasant seeing WHAO again sigh.. (http://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=18259)

Anyway AWHETO seems like the ideal play here, as does HOWZAT. HOWZAT is a bit better.

>Hubert: ?EHKNRU 13D .HRUNKEn +70 271
#note HOWZAT would have forced Hubert to play SHURIKEN.
>Jeremy: ORSTTWW K2 TOWT +26 223
>Hubert: EILPRTX 15D .XTIRP +45 316
#note Interestingly enough, that E of GROSZE has stayed wide open for so long.
>Jeremy: EERSTVW 2K .REW +14 237
#note 7D WEN looks strong. A lot of Is and As to pick up to replace the E.
>Hubert: AEILNNU 1L UNAI +25 341
#note 14B NAZE/LAZE and 14D ZEIN score more but you kinda have to block the TREWS spot.
