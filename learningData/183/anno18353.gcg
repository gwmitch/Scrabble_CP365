#note Chose to score 61 instead of 66 because I don't like the spot it opens. Q says I'm dumb.

#note I was like 90% sure this wasn't good, but I figured I could play it anyway. FIB L12 sims above this, even with the assumption that it stays on. But I know he's very bingo prone after DEE and assume an S is on his rack quite often. Still, a bad play says quackle.

>Matt_Canik: LQSVWWY 1F SLY +21 228
#note With Roger opening this aggressively, I think it's safe to assume a blank and at least a very solid leave. I think I *have* to block this, I don't think I'm outrunning an 80 point bingo too often. If I can dodge a bingo in the 11 row and N column, I can still probably win this game. 

Of note: I think I kept literally the worst 4-tile leave available in the unseen pool with this play. Maybe QJWW is worse than QVWW.

#note ...or not. 
>Matt_Canik: AABGQVW I3 Q. +21 279
#note If I exchange now, it becomes a "bingo or lose" situation on a board that is horrible for bingos. This holds (s)AW/WOS for 27, and if Roger is unable to score well for a turn or two I may actually have a chance. I just need a horrible pull from him...
>Roger_Cullman: ADIOU D1 AUDIO +27 330
#note That was a horrible pull, but not horrible enough :(

#note Only way to win the game. Quite certain it's no good, but I've gotta try it.
