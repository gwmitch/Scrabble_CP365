>Nigel: DIPU D8 .UPID +20 20
#note Should he play PUDIC?

>Nigel: AEEGIN 10C E.IGEAN +14 34
#note Did he keep an E? 
>Siddharth_Murali: DISTTVZ 7H DITZ +22 77
#note The interesting D(E)V(E)ST for 16 sims best, followed by VISIT, ZITIS, and then DITZ. Now (6/13/15) I believe DITZ is a bigger mistake than I did earlier. Although DEVEST is hard to find and play over the board, it's clear- Scores a little, keeps a scoring leave, and dropss Nigel's per turn down to 31.
>Nigel: EJOY L4 JOEY +46 80
>Siddharth_Murali: ABMSTVV 8L STAB +37 114
#note I saw VOMIT only next turn. I arguably only made minor mistakes from this point on, but this turn and last turn were two decent-sized mistakes that I can't afford against Nigel.
>Nigel: OORSSTU N3 OUTSO.RS +62 142
#note Punished for my mistakes for the second straight turn.

#note No bingos. At the time I chose this over VAN to set up the case blank or S, despite keeping the inferior static leave.
>Nigel: BE E5 BE..... +28 300
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AAINQR J5 QA. +14 221
#note QAID over QAT since he will have UI a good portion of the time. Sim likes (G)RAN as well but that will not work.

#note Tricky endgame, I should save QUOIT and play ET at 14E to prevent the WYN -- > WYND sequence.
