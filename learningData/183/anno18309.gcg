#note Chose this over JOKER to keep more tiles in the bag and preserve B5 JOKER and the potential for other high scoring plays as well. Quackle concurs, but this only wins just over 3%. I accidentally scored this play as 58.

#note If I draw the Q, I am all set since I have F2 QUOIT and 3I QUOD. If Joey has the Q, The best he can really have is 15A QI which I figured I could outrun being up a few points and a tempo. I missed FATHEADED, though, which is clearly better (even if I saw it, I would have not been sure and thus would have eschewed it).
