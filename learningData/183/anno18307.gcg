>Mack_: BGHIOQU 2F QU.IGH +43 43
#note This, QUAHOG, QUOHOG, and G7 QI are all respectable options. I figured BOUGH was not a good leave so discarded QI, and felt this was the best of the other options. Interestingly, QI sims about 2% higher than this, which I don't really understand or agree with.
>Wally: EHO G7 HOE +23 91
>Mack_: BEOPTTU F8 BOUT +16 59
#note This keeps a more open board than DOUBT, which is advantageous since I am down. This also sims better than I7 PETTO, the other play I considered.
>Wally: EEINX 1K EXINE +65 156
>Mack_: AEEIPRT I7 PEATIER +82 141
>Wally: AENY H12 YEAN +44 200
>Mack_: AGLNORW 12H ..ARLONG +28 169
#note Though opening the board is the right strategy, this is not correct. Keeping the W alone is not smart, and the board is open enough that I should just play WRONG(ER). This is about a 3.5% error.
>Wally: AFF O12 .AFF +33 233
>Mack_: AEOORRW N1 .ARROW +34 203
>Wally: LNOO O5 NOLO +19 252
>Mack_: BEEOSUW N11 U.BE +26 229
#note This looks better than BOWED, as it keeps an even vowel to consonant ratio and keeps the board more open.
>Wally: AADEILS 5D SALA.IED +82 334
#note This was undoubtedly the game winning play, as Wally not only bingos but blocks my 98 point COWRITES.
>Mack_: CEIOSTW 4A WITE +26 255
#note At this point, I need more than a bingo to win so I figued I'd open up a 3*3 lane. Nothing wins more than 3% of the time.

>Mack_: ACMRSTT 7A .M +4 308
#note Figured I'd go for SCATTER, as Wally will have a difficult time blocking it if I do draw the E.
