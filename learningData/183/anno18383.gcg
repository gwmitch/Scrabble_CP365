>Matt_Graham: EEEFMUY 8F FUMY +24 24
#note This is my first time playing in a championship game for a multiday tourney ever. Matt took awhile this turn thinking about FUMEY*, then played this 8G, then picked it up and thought about FUMY some more, then moved it 1 spot over. Quackle likes 8G FUMY.
>Morris: ?ADEEGL F8 .ED +11 11
#note I did not know (M)EGADEaL, great word! I also completely missed ALlEGED and AnGELED, which is pretty surprising to me. I said throughout the tournament I wasn't playing that well, just getting the right stuff.
>Matt_Graham: EEEJKO 10B JOKE. +33 57
>Morris: ?AEEGLO H8 .EsOGLEA +86 97
>Matt_Graham: AEENO 7I AEON +11 68
#note OA(K)EN is nice here.
>Morris: ANNORTX 11C RAX +46 143
#note This was a tough decision between RAX and AXON 8L. I went for the points, Quackle sim agrees, but I am not sure, they both have their merits.
>Matt_Graham: EEGO 12A OGEE +29 97
>Morris: ENNNOTU 8K NONET +23 166
#note I was choosing between NONET and NUN in the same spot here, Quackle agrees with my choice, though also likes NOUN 6F.
>Matt_Graham: ADOSS 6J ADO +17 114
#note Matt said he didn't want to telegraph an S here.
>Morris: AHIIINU -III +0 166
#note I was at first considering playing NU 5J, then exchanging. This lead me to keep NU in my exchange in case I still wanted to block, but that was a horrible idea I sort of realized right after I did it. If I exchange, I should be going for bingos. This is 4% behind exchanging all 7 according to Quackle, which I think is too narrow a differnece, this seems like a larger mistake to me. I am still 66% to win according to Quackle many ply sim. Quackle also likes (O)HIA a bunch, I am not crazy about it, though the game certainly would've been a lot different if I did that.
>Matt_Graham: ABGRSS M2 BRAGS +21 135
>Morris: AHINTUV 5H VATU +27 193
#note Another tough decision between VAUNTI(E) 14B and VATU. I am pretty sure Matt has an S. If we infer no S, VAUNTIE wins 68% according to many ply sim, and VATU is 66%. If we infer an S, VATU wins 61%, VAUNTIE 60%. I am happy with my choice, when I asked Matt after the game, he prefered VAUNTIE.
>Matt_Graham: IQ N1 QI +30 165
>Morris: HIINTTU O1 IT +44 237
#note INTUIT! Also, INTI. This is a large-ish mistake, I auto-piloted this play. This is 66% to win, INTUIT is 81%, with an S inference many ply Quackle sim.
>Matt_Graham: ACEELRS O8 .REACLES +89 254
>Morris: EHINTTU 4L H.UT +16 253
>Matt_Graham: DDILNRS 14F DR.IDL +16 270
#note Matt said that he had DIRNDLS here. I guess VATU worked out in this scenario.
>Morris: EHIMNTW 9E H.M. +32 285
#note I was choosing here between H(E)M(E) 9E, HM N10, and W(O)MEN A11. With only 1 E left and all of the I's still out, I just can't afford to sacrifice leave for defense with W(O)MEN keeping hit. I am eying the row 3 lane ending in R as the most likely at this point for a bingo, I need the E. I miscounted HM as 30, and didn't see enough difference between the two for the "extra" 2 points. However, Matt could make an easy 2 tile fish for some points at N10, or just bingo in column N starting with the N, so this is worse, though less than 1% worse according to Quackle.
>Matt_Graham: ?BLOSY A11 L.OBY +30 300
>Morris: EIIINTW 3G TWINIE. +17 302
#note I just have to go for the blank at this point and get rid of as many I's as possible. This and WIENI(E) 10J crush the sim, it is just a matter of which lane to block.
>Matt_Graham: ?EINORS M8 .EgRONIS +66 366
#note Ouch.
>Morris: AAIIIPR B8 RA. +10 312
#note I was fishing for SPAZ, but this is way too easy for Matt to block, plus he could still outrun me since I'd have all of the I's. Quackle's favorite play, PIA 2F, wins 4.5% of the time, though I don't see how it wins ever since neither SATIRIC nor ASPIRIN can play after PIA.
>Matt_Graham: CFPUWZ 9A P.W +23 389
#note Matt made sure he wouldn't be Z stuck, with FU(T)Z G1 and C(O)Z 11G.
>Morris: AIIIPSV K12 PI.I +6 318
#note AVI(D) J11 to set up PAVID nets 5 more points.
>Matt_Graham: CFNTUZ G1 FU.Z +16 405
#note (Y)UTZ
>Morris: AISV 12F VI. +7 325
#note VIA(L)S
>Matt_Graham: CNT 14M .C. +10 415
#note Overall, I played this game fine after the first turn, that was bad and missing INTUIT was bad, but I got lucky throughout the tournament with bigger mistakes. This time it caught up to me, I drew 9 I's during the game. I really don't think I even deserved cashing for the way I played this tournament, but I'll take it. I need to review a lot before Nationals, I was quite ill prepared for this tournament out of busyness these past few weeks. Congratulations to Matt, you played an excellent game and tournament, and it was an honor playing in the finals against you.
#note Congratulations to Matt Graham for winning the tournament! He played an excellent game. I can't be too upset with how I fared, the first turn bingo miss and INTUIT are mistakes, but I can live with them. I got pretty lucky throughout the tournament, and this was the time my mistakes caught up to my results.
