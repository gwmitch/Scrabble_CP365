#note Damn... talked myself out of CHIGGER. I just haven't studied enough sevens. It's a big error. As for the OHIA play, I was pretty certain he was setting up an S. Though it's not definite. But what can I do about it? HAGGED? CADGE? CADGE would have worked out in the end, but is still bad a lot of the time. Even with the S inference, CHIGGER (and DIGGER actually) sim better in Quackle.
