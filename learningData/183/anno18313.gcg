#note This seemed just worth playing, and sims neck and neck with exchanging all.

#note Quackle prefers WINZE by about 1.5%, but I prefer unloading the Q and saving the Z for H1 next turn.

#note This sims surprisingly well. It only leaves two bingo lanes, the R at O1 and row 13 hooking ITS. Another benefit of this play was that...
>Diane: INU -  +0 183
#note She challenged.
>Mack_: ABEESTV 8K .AVES +33 284
#note This opens a few lanes, but puts me up over a bingo  and if Diane can't bingo immediately I can block all the lanes and will almost definitely win.
>Diane: INU O1 .UIN +5 188
>Mack_: BEELNST N6 BE.TLE +16 300
#note (OFT)ENEST is a cool play I missed, but I like this better anyway as it forces Dians to bingo with ITS, and such a bingo won't even be enough. I can't come up with many, if any, situations where this loses, but there are definitely a few miracle cases where OFTENEST might lose, so this looks superior anyway.
>Diane: EER L11 ERE +11 199
>Mack_: DEMNRSX M12 EX +38 338
#note Dropping the X at N2 is obviously way better statically, but I wanted to block the new bingo lane Diane created. Either way, it is virtually impossible for me to lose here.
>Diane: AIL J10 .AIL +10 209
>Mack_: DEJMNRS 14F MENDS +23 361
#note I thought this made it impossible for Diane to bingo aside from something like SOLONETZ on row 1, but...
>Diane: ?ADENTU B5 DENATUr. +66 275
#note I missed that lane. Nice spot by Diane, this is her only bingo.

#note I thought this was better than going out with MERLS since I thought Diane had GE and not GD, but MERLS is 8 better.
