#note I could not imagine losing the game unless Leah had a miracle bingo. The board is closed, very hard to score and go out in two. My logic therefore dictated that I needed to block the N now and get rid of my Q later. I had tracked correctly, but I was running low on time. I did not have time to verify that I had indeed tracked correctly. So I played it safe! But this was not safe. This is a strategic error that I have never made before. My intuition was wrong. How do I know that she can't get more than 49 points more than me in the endgame? It seems ridiculous, but it is indeed possible. You will witness the only draw that I lose to after ANGLED. And it's weird...

#note Oh, the H! That's quite clunky.

#note And then she laid this down, and I cringed.

In this scenario it was important to forget about a freak bingo, and just make the best play with perfect board vision and word knowledge. That play is A2 Q(I).
