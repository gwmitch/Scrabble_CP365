#note I reaaaaaally considered RAGLIKE here, for 92. But I knew TAGLIKE and BAGLIKE. That's enough for me to question where I was getting the idea that RAGLIKE was valid. I almost took GLAIKET off, but I went ahead with it. I knew that if the word was accepted, putting an S on it would be instantly challenged. That was my level of confidence. I was only 99% sure GLAIKET was valid...

#note I was getting ready to play PREMOVE*! Good thing she blocked... PE(R)V is probably fine, but why not destroy the board little by little?

#note probably not the right play, but it looked like it guaranteed me nice outs most of the time and scored better than anything else.
