#note Hey, I'll just bingo down to the D next turn, no need to control the board with a lead and a bingo-ey rack... I really can't explain why I didn't just play JIR(D)... Guess I felt infallible.

#note Little did I know I had been making bad moves all game. First turn where I realized that. I was more sure of this phony than I was of the valid word I thought was invalid. Both HUNGERED and THIRSTED are valid. I thought the opposite.
