>Joshua_Sokol: DEMMNOS H8 MODEM +26 26
#note looking for an open board here. Seems more likely that will happen, just slightly, with my placement over the other.
>Joan_Buma: AIQ 10F QA.I +34 34
>Joshua_Sokol: ?FINNSW 11E WIN. +27 53
#note NWS looks more synergistic but I wanted to set up another hook for some reason. Perhaps I should just play W(A)N for 21. That looks like a very good play for me.
>Joan_Buma: ITU D11 TUI +14 48
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFINRS 8H .ISiNFER +89 142
#note I didn't know the other 89-pointer, ENSIFORM. That's a cool play. Doesn't do much for board control though, as now it seems like I am very much in control.
>Joan_Buma: AILOORT L3 LOTIO. +12 60
#note This was her rack, I think. Neither of us found (F)AROLITO!
>Joshua_Sokol: BCEENPY N6 BE.PY +26 168
#note I saw 13C B(I)CEP, 3K B(L)YPE and K4 YEP first, but then I seemed to remember BEEPY being new. Well, it isn't. 5J EC(T)YPE is cute. BEEPY* is obviously right if it isn't challenged though, since it leaves me with a great leave and thoroughly blocks column O, which reduces the amount of variance that will proceed this move. Little did Joan know, challenging this play would have proven extremely important for her.
>Joan_Buma: APY K4 YAP +29 89
#note I liked where this was going! It's not too often that wanting a wide-open board makes a tightly controlled board simply fall into my hands.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACDELNN O1 CANDLE +37 245
#note If only the B in BEEPY weren't on the board, I saw that I had an awesome nine! 
>Joan_Buma: AGLR 13A GLA.R +12 114
#note As Joan said here, and so true it was, "desperate times call for desperate measures!"

#note Before the game, I was telling Joan how I believed timing was so important in Scrabble, much more so that the tiles you draw. Well, I was kind of right, but, yeah, I drew way too well this game.
