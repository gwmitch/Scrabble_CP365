#note so none of the rack leaves he could possibly have make any sense, as either he missed a bingo or kept GIRTIE or something insane. So most likely he had TIRLING and didn't know it.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFLNRU G5 FUN.AL +16 27
#note So I didn't consider playing FRENULA here. I just didn't want to let him bingo. I think it's probably right to bingo here.
>Michael_Fagen: EGIINRT 6A INTRIG.E +65 86
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIKRTT E5 T.CKIER +52 79
#note First I laid down TRICKIE, which I knew was good, but wasn't sure if it took an S or not, and then decided to go for the points. this isn't a word but that doesn't matter cause I knew he wouldn't challenge here. TRICKIE might be right.
>Michael_Fagen: DIU 7A DUI +13 99
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIOOPT A1 ADIPO.. +42 121
#note hmm, he might challenge FOOTPAD? I didn't see it nor did I know it though. This is the best play. I didn't think he would challenge, and even if he does he might give me an R or an N for an 8. That was my thought process here. Also, I can pluralize this phony and he can't.
>Michael_Fagen: S A1 .......S +36 135
>Michael_Fagen: S --  -36 99
#note as I said
>Joshua_Sokol: EORTTTX B1 TOTE +22 143
#note Him playing the S got me worried he had a no-go on his rack, so my idea of playing DEXTRO got much worse. I think this is fine. I also considered phonying with TEXTO, but that might stand a chance of getting challenged.
>Michael_Fagen: IMU H8 ..IUM +12 111
>Joshua_Sokol: EEMORRX 5G .OREX +32 175
#note hoping to get challenged, nope.
>Michael_Fagen: CEO 4K ECO +19 130
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGMTUZ D10 TEGU +14 189
#note I considered points with D10. That play would have been much better if Michael hadn't played ECO and blew the board open. In another universe MEZE would have blocked a lot of stuff. Instead I decided to be patient with my Z.
>Michael_Fagen: ABERRST 3E BARTERS +71 201
#note He literally said "no you don't have the Z" before playing this. M2 ABORTERS looks best.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEMOSYZ 14B MOSEY +42 231
#note ZEE is indeed 67, but after he said I didn't have the Z, I showed my Z to him. I just really wanted to psych him out. Now he will probably block the hotspot next turn, wrongly so, as I can score with my Z in many different places after MOSEY. This was almost challenged.
>Michael_Fagen: AW H1 WA. +18 219
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEHNNZ 15E HAZE +58 289
#note Ugh, I knew this leave was asking for trouble, but 58 points vs 30 or so is so hard to give up. I should play 15E HENNA. I didn't consider that longly enough.
>Michael_Fagen: ?AEIORS 12H .ORAInES +70 289
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALNNQW N10 Qu.AN +66 355
#note That's good enough for my blank.
>Michael_Fagen: DIJN O8 DJIN. +51 340
#note drat!
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHLNOW 15A HOW +36 391
#note I had no idea what to do here, but I knew that the pool was really clunky, and that unless Michael had a rack on the very far end of the spectrum (which would mean I would draw very clunky stuff), I knew I was fine. 2D BAH is a better play though, as is BOW for 3 less, which both make sense. This is still over a 90% favorite.
>Michael_Fagen: ADEFISV 15J ADVISE +56 396
#note That rack tho. -3 to VISA.
