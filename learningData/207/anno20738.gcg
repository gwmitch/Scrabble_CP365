#note Think I let fun get in the way of best here.   a Dozen bingos valuated 5-6% better to win and valuated 3-7 pts better.   (M)UtINInG simmed best

#note A(NE)AR H11 sims best (before and after 1000 iterations run).  It gets  rids duplicates, helps avoid possible duplicate R's (3 unseen to me), helps avoid a possible consonant-heavy rack, and scores 8more points.   

Mine finished in middle of pack of AA plays, all around 65% to win.   Compared to 76% for ANEAR.    Booooo.

#note Instead, Steve gets to shed consonants and have a 3/4 chance to win now.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEIJRTW M12 .I +4 366
#note Initial Q suggestion in WAR 2M, 12% to win.   I'd considred RAJ there, but maybe the J is worth saving for column N.

After 1000 iterations however, AW 9L and JI(G) come out at almost 50% to win.

My play was a lousy 11% to win.   I fished for shot at WAT(E)RJET or a J play from 14J (JITTER and JILTER ony hammers possible).  To boot, Steve saw the bingo fish and would've blocked.
