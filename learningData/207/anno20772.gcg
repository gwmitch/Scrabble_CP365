#note (BEACH)HEAD for 40 is flashy!

This is a bit too aggressive, HEARD gives back way less but I really liked the thought of play 6 tiles leaving H. Not worth it, looking back.

#note Nothing stands out here, literally. It's literally my play, or fish. I'm taking 6 chances at a blank with 21 in the bag, I have to hope his fish from last turn doesn't work also. Tough call here, but I think this has to be preferable to fishing, because of the points and the fact that my fish will bury me completely if he bingoes and I don't with my nice looking Q rack, which seemed very possible.
