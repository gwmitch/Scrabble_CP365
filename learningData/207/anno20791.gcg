>Matthew_Larocque: ABFKLMO 8E BALK +20 20
#note I was sure I was missing a 5 letter word here. I almost tried *FLAMB. There are none, even including the updated dictionary! Also I should play FOLK since the M and B go together.
>Maureen_Morris: DEGISST I4 DIGESTS +72 72
>Matthew_Larocque: FMOOPRR H1 POMO +31 51
#note I considered PROF J2 to keep a better leave, but if you study words then you'd play PROFORMA. 
>Maureen_Morris: CEEENRT 10C CENTRE. +11 83
#note Pretty sure she told me she had a third E. In that case she missed PRETENCE, and she'd probably be better off keeping a stronger leave here since she isn't scoring well anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: FJPRRRV D9 P.RV +18 69
#note I did remember that PERVY was valid now, but didn't know if Maureen knew that. She said after that she did.
>Maureen_Morris: AEFL J2 LEAF +18 101
#note Setting up an S?
>Matthew_Larocque: DFJRRRT -DJRRT +0 69
#note I really needed her to not block FJ(O)RD. Certainly have to keep the F here in case that huge spot stays open.
>Maureen_Morris: I E8 .I. +9 110
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHRTUW K5 FEW +36 105
#note No way I'm going to see TUR(BIN)E, but after her fish I can't possibly leave IF open anyways.
>Maureen_Morris: ??AEILN 6B cLEANIn. +59 169
#note She didn't take long to play this, but she has a zillion ways to score at least 10 more points. INTERLAP up top scores 77.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHJRTU C2 JURE. +24 129
#note Damn forgot about THUJA, and JUT(E)/JUR(A) looks safer.
>Maureen_Morris: CENO D1 CONE +33 202
#note With the blanks gone, I really can't afford to let her keep scoring big.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADHOQTZ 5E ZA +46 175
#note Good time to draw a ZA bomb.
>Maureen_Morris: ADENORT L6 DONATER +76 278
>Maureen_Morris: ADENORT --  -76 202
#note Good time for opponent phony.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHOQTU L6 TOQUE +31 206
#note Didn't see QUE(AN) which doesn't let her grab easy points like TOQUE does.
>Maureen_Morris: ADENORT 11J RATED +27 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEGHX M3 DEBAG +34 240
#note Sim agrees, I should be able to catch up with the handy X next turn.
>Maureen_Morris: GINORSS 13D SIGNORS +70 299
#note Nooooooo. Now, I'm not going to say I played great this tournament, but the luck/draws were firmly on my opponent's side this time around. Getting double blanked and bingoed on 3/4 times would be a recurring theme.
>Matthew_Larocque: AHX H12 H.AX +54 294
#note Missed rack but this must have been the right play.
>Maureen_Morris: AINO 15G A.ION +12 311
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHIMOT L2 HEM +27 321
#note MO(JO) seemed risky with WYY unseen. HIM/HOM could be a disaster if she has the W. Went for the lesser risk of setting up my T and hoping she didn't have the other one or missed the hook. Quackle strongly disagrees. I also considered TH(E)MED or TH(E)ME, but thought I needed more than just a big score this turn to win the game.
>Maureen_Morris: AINTV N11 .IVAN +18 329
>Matthew_Larocque: DIOOTWY 1L TOWY +43 364
#note I've never been happier to draw WY. Also, she told me she had the T but no plays to reach the TWS. She must have missed TAIN. She can also just block.
>Maureen_Morris: IILRTUY 13L TI.Y +20 349
>Matthew_Larocque: DIOU 2A DO.. +24 388
#note I'm actually gonna win this despite her bingos!
>Maureen_Morris: ILRU B6 .URL +3 352
>Matthew_Larocque: IU 15M U.I +9 397
#note Skimming over the 3s and 4s came in handy.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (I) +2 399
