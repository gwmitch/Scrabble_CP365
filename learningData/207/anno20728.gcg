#note Now that I was locked into first, the real games begun. I wanted to at least get one game from Mark, the top seed in the division. See, I was 2-0 against him lifetime... :)
>Joshua_Sokol: Q 7G Q. +21 21
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ADFHIRT 5E THI.F +22 64
#note QI was accompanied with "I can't even do anything else"-type mutter, so I imagined that his range was likely not something like TONERS, but rather a lot of clunky stuff. This is why I played this. But there are certainly other plays worth considering here. But I still like this. And it worked. I wanted to reduce his options as much as I could.

#note After the game Mark wondered if there was possibly anything else in this rack. He had seen nothing. I saw GYPSTERS!
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EELMNRS 10E MEL +16 104
#note I wondered if Mark would have challenged EARLSMEN* here. I was thinking about it, not knowing if it was valid. I think he said he wouldn't have. There was my chance to get back in the game! Also, B2 RE(A)LM is the play here.
