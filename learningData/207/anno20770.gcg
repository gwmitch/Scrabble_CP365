#note Quackle likes a few things over my play, but I stand by it. I don't think that leaving AEINT is adequate, especially early in the game with so much of the unseen pool remaining. If it were consonant heavy, why not? But not the case.

After 6000 iterations, 10H P(E)A wins the sim. I don't feel like this is a mistake, but (P)IPA leaving AENT seems to be the only other reasonable play here...(-5.8)

#note 4I QUAL(I)A wins sim, I didn't even consider this play. I liked my play for it's leave / not opening up things for her, which is exactly what the other options do. N1 QUAD sims well also. (-6.8)
