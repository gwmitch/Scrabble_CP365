>Joshua_Sokol: ABGNOTU E1 GUNBOA. +20 50
#note I saw GUNBOAT, saw it didn't play, and then just blanked on what to do about it not playing. Then I just decided to play it anyway, hoping maybe it would get challenged. (T)UGBOAT is better for sure. Missed that. The aggressive play is ABO or OBA 6F. I saw AUTO. leaving NG and two iffy one-point tiles just never seems justified to me, so I kind of don't look for that sort of play. It is of course true that GNTU is decent enough for bingos, but for everything else it is just bad. I just don't want to leave myself with such variant tiles, so I fail to consider some plays. ABO and OBA are good scoring plays too. Otherwise, I saw AUTO 6E, and didn't like it. It wasn't in my interest to open up an easy 7 lane either. 8A GUANO looks decent, though. It successfully restricts a lot of the board without opening too much. But obviously I'm more worried about IN(G) bingos against lower-rated players than against higher-rated ones, since they tend to go for that combination.
>Lilla_Sinanan: EEFFINT 4C FI. +16 30
#note Lilla said she had an unplayable FINFEET* here. She was confused with FINFOOT. I said that FIFTEEN was the word in FINFEET*.
>Joshua_Sokol: AKORRTU 1E .ROK +27 77
#note I could have played RUGRAT+$ here! That's a funky new word I didn't know. For scoring purposes I should definitely play RA(G)OUT here, for 24. I missed that possibility.

>Lilla_Sinanan: EGLU 9D LUGE +15 60
>Joshua_Sokol: DEORTUV 5H DEVOUT +25 137
#note I didn't like 8A DOVE. I preferred not to add any unnecessary variance to thegame by opening up a dangerous lane.
>Lilla_Sinanan: ?EINSTW L5 .NWISEsT +72 132
#note ah, she would have had (D)OWNIEST! UNTWINES in the same spot is 78.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEORRRS K8 BORE +22 159
#note In the same idea as last turn, I preferred not playing at 8A here to prevent bad case scenarios from occurring. Here I also considered 10G REBOR(E), but there were two S's out, so that reduced the value of setting my own up. It's probably a better play, though. Also, 10F ORB is another aggressive play, that looks better than REBORE. I didn't see that one. Anyways, I was in a defensive mood, so bear with me, even if you may disagree.
>Lilla_Sinanan: IQ 3B QI +32 164
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNRRST 8K ..RLE +21 180
#note I didn't want to change gears here, but QI meant she probably didn't have much of anything. More likely than usual=make a more aggressive play than usual I guess. But if I'm going to play BIRLE, I should probably play BIRLS. The leave is more conducive to bingos, and is less variant. I don't to rely on drawing 2 or 3 vowels here.
>Lilla_Sinanan: AELP 8A PALE +24 188
>Joshua_Sokol: DJNORST 6B JOT. +27 207
#note Again, I don't necessarily need to hold on to my S here. I could play JO(L)TS or S(L)OJD on column N. I also didn't consider just JO(L)T, cause I was too focused on wanting to maximize my bingo percentage at the expense of allowing Lilla to blow me out of the water more often than not. I should play JO(L)T over JOT(A), I think, even though DNRS gets really bad the moment I don't leave that E open. Hmm...
>Lilla_Sinanan: AYZ N8 .AZY +36 224
>Joshua_Sokol: DENNRSW E9 .NDREW +20 227
#note Well, the spot was taken anyway. Now I'm kind of in a bad position. Playing UNDREW by all means was not my favorite thing to do, but it beat fishing. The pool isn't all that balanced. I also wanted to keep up with Lilla, which always has that psychological advantage.
>Lilla_Sinanan: AO -  +0 224
#note And she challenged! Immediately she regretted pulling the trigger, since this was such a pivotal position for both of us. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ACCGHNS 13B CAG. +14 241
#note In this position, I saw 7L (W)AG for 29. That looked great, but I was really paranoid about leave the left side of the board unscathed, especially after Lilla said "that challenge probably lost me the game". That could either mean she didn't have much, or that she had something big that I was likely to block this turn! There are many plays that are better than CAG(E) here. I really blanked on what to do. 13A CACH(E) looks good, but 12D C(R)ANCH looks great! It takes out that annoying lane at J9 (that I myself created, mind you) and scores the best out of anything. The problem is that I won't really be able to respond to anything Lilla comes up with with a GS leave, unless I draw well. But that's fine. C(R)ANCH is the play. I didn't even know the word though. :(
>Lilla_Sinanan: ?ALNOOV D12 A.O +17 241
>Joshua_Sokol: CHINNSS 15A CHIN +36 277
#note 3H SHIN looks great! I missed that. I also missed N8 (LAZY)ISH for 44! 
>Lilla_Sinanan: ?EILNOV 1J OI +11 252
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNOSST 3I TONSILS +79 356
#note I took 5 minutes, was failing to find any 6s that blocked what I wanted to block; row 3 and column O, and then I saw TONSIL. Heh, almost missed it!
>Lilla_Sinanan: IT M12 IT +6 258
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIMPV J10 AMIE +17 373
#note There was no need to even look for her 9s at O1 here. This is when you have to make the endgame play that induces the most mistakes. I block all of her easy to find bingos, and make her struggle to find a crazy disconnected 9. I didn't see any after making this play, but AR(S)ENID(E)S, DI(S)PENS(E)R and DI(S)SENT(E)R play. Needless to say, I made the right decision.
