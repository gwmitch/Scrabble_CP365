>Avery: AEIMRST H4 MAESTRI +74 74
#note Game from 4/26/15. Wow.

Avery: This was a tough bingo to find!
>Mack: ?ACLLOV 6F CO.VALLy +70 70
#note Mack: Didn't see COLLUVIA, but this scores more, and OVERCALL is slightly less safe
>Avery: AEEEQST -EEQ +0 74
#note Avery: Quackle values G10 QAT 5 points higher than this. I'm pretty surprised! Mack sees the reason it might be valued higher, but says he would exchange EEQ too.
>Mack: DFGHINY K5 F.YING +26 96
#note Mack: I would do DIGNIFY if I had to do it over, but not a huge error by any means
>Avery: AABERST G9 ABREAST +68 142
#note Avery: I autopiloted to this. But of course Mack saw the 9. And Sid suggests BEARCATS, which I like a lot more than this.
>Mack: DEEHHIO H13 HOE +31 127
#note Mack: I figured DEHI was better than DEHO, but apparently keeping DEHO with HIE in the same spot is slightly better than HOE. I considred DOETH but wanted to keep the extra consonant.
>Avery: AEEIJOO F9 JOE +31 173
#note Avery: So I keep 4 vowels. Let's see what happens!
>Mack: DEHIOUW E11 HOWE +32 159
#note Of note: HOUDAH/HOWDAH
>Avery: ADEINOR 4C RADIO.EN +72 245
#note Avery: And I draw DNR. What??
>Mack: DIILRTU C2 LU.ID +12 171
#note Mack: I considered L8 DUI but wanted to open another lane being down more than a bingo now
>Avery: DEFPQUU 8J P.QUED +84 329
#note Avery: ...158 point lead and that will all go away shortly.
>Mack: EGIKORT J1 IKO. +18 189
#note Mack: Didn't know KLIEG and didn't see JARGON, but given the score, I think I need to be proactive here and hope for a miracle 3x3.

Note: this play doesn't appear on static's choices
>Avery: ?AEFILU B6 InFULAE +68 397
#note Avery: Well since I can't play FIBULAE anymore... and I am now 208 ahead. Nothing can go wrong! But seriously - Me and Chris (Tallman) both agree that I should do something to block the triple-triple lane. I see KULFI immediately.
>Mack: AEEGMRT 1H EM.GRATE +158 347
#note Mack: Wait, is this game really not over yet?

Avery: Dammit Mack stop being so lucky
>Avery: AEINRTZ A11 ZAIRE +59 456
>Mack: INPSSTX 11I XIS +48 395
#note Avery: I held this, but given my rack I can't afford to lose the challenge and stay with this rack. (it's good)

Mack: Chosen over SIX to avoid blocking the E, even though I felt it didn't matter. Boy was I wrong about it not mattering...
>Avery: BNNNTTW -BNNNTTW +0 456
#note Avery: Quackle likes WONT .1 better than this, but I'm not doing that. 

Side note: Mack and I have a trend where he keeps bingoing after being 200 down, so assuming he bingoes here (which I did not expect) I want to trade everything so he gets stuck with it
>Mack: CNPRSTY N8 .NCRYPTS +92 487
#note Mack: Wait, am I going to win this game?
>Avery: DEGIOOV A4 VOGIE +60 516
#note Avery: Nope
>Mack: ABNNNTT D12 BATT +29 516
#note Mack: Trying to find the high loss
>Avery: DOUW 3I W.O +19 535
#note Avery: best endgame
>Mack: NNN 13C N.. +12 528
>Avery: DU 13L DU. +12 547
#note Avery: A great game - kudos to Mack for making it exciting and fun. Always a pleasure to play.

Mack: Oh well. Very well done by Avery and this was one of the most insane games I've ever played
