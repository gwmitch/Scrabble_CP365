>Mack: BDFINSV H7 FIB +16 16
#note This was a really crazy game I played on ISC against the bot WAXBERRY. Exchanging BFV sims slightly ahead, which I probably agree with in hindsight. -2%
>Waxberry: CMORTUV I9 OVUM +15 15
>Mack: DEKNSTV 11H D.NK +18 34
#note Oscillates with DUVET in the same spot. I definitely like DUNK, it keeps a more balanced and bingo-prone leave while restricting underlaps better.
>Waxberry: ABCNORT H11 .OBRA +32 47
>Mack: EIILSTV 15E VIT.LISE +62 96
>Waxberry: CHJNNPT 14L PHT +20 67
#note Exchanging to CH looks a bit better, though that is out of the question for Waxberry as ISC bots can't exchage.
>Mack: ?EEGORR J3 REORGEd +63 159
#note GREEnRO(OM) is sick and I word I did not know. I like this better than much riskier alternatives like G1 REGORgE. -3%
>Waxberry: CJNNOSS M11 JOS. +28 95
>Mack: ACEILRT 5H ER.TICAL +70 229
#note Seems better than G1 ARTICLE in order to open multiple hotspots instead of just one.
>Waxberry: CEINNSX 14H .EX +53 148
>Mack: DEELOTT 3E DOTTE.EL +61 290
#note Oopsies - TOILETED is clearly better. Played too fast. Either way, I have just bingo-bango-bongo-bungoed so should be in great shape. Right?
>Waxberry: CEINNSY O1 SYNC.INE +194 342
#note Nope!
>Mack: ?AGQUUW N5 .QUA +68 358
#note Very lucky to draw this after the triple-triple.
>Waxberry: AEEFHLN 2F HAEN +34 376
#note LETHE looks a lot better to avoid opening the easy hotspot.
>Mack: ?AGIRUW 1H WAUR +42 400
>Waxberry: DEFLNYZ 12L F.ZY +46 422
>Mack: ?GIIIRW G6 WIG +17 417
#note Quackle is liking ZITI, but bingoing seems like the best way to win at this stage and keeping GIRW is much uglier for bingos than IIR especially with just one I unseen. I still like this.
>Waxberry: ADELNOT 4C ANODE +25 447
#note F5 NOD looks great here to make it extremely difficult for me to bingo.
>Mack: ?EGIIPR 3A GIP +20 437
#note At this point Waxberry is definitely shaping up to be the victor as he can just block column A and leave me with little options for bingoing. Right?
>Waxberry: AADELMT 5C DAM +32 479
#note ..........
>Mack: ?EINORS A1 nE.RONIS +131 568
#note Nope! 
>Waxberry: AAEILTU N1 EAU +20 499
>Mack: O 6F O. +7 575
#note What a ridiculous game!
