#note I5 MOR(R)O is the best by far. Cute fit. Best by about 4.1 over the next best play. I thought for a while on this play, M12 MHO I considered by I liked the fact that he's gonna struggle on this board after my play, but MOR(R)O is certainly the play here. (-9.8)

#note O(Y)ER creates two lanes, forking is the term I believe. AERT > EERT, of course, as well. I didn't look further than my play because of the cute fit but I need to think more thoroughly. (-4.7)

#note Didn't know MOLTO. It's an adverb. 

Had I known it, I would have played it, but my thinking here was I want to block the EYEN hook, because after playing two tiles off I assume he has a nice rack. LOOM leaves the hooks for B and G, with 2 of each remaining, plus the blank. This might have been overly paranoid, in hindsight, but either way it's a word knowledge mistake. (-10.3)

>Joey_Krafchick: EEIKORU 14M OKE +19 325
#note With the unseen pool, there isn't a killer comeback play under OKE. If he bites, and has something like PIN, he'll be breaking up his rack while I can close the board next turn. If he DOES bingo, it's roughly tied, because his bingo would be roughly 65, and I could potentially hit this spot. EEK is the equity play for sure, I can't recall if I saw it. (-9.5)
