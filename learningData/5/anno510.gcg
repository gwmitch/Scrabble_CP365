#note Not so great. I wanted to keep the board open, but SEABAG (A6) scores too well to pass up.

#note Who the heck is this guy? Nothing special about ARGOSIES, but TSKTSKED is just nuts. And some nice intermediate plays like PINYIN - he seems to know what he's doing.
Even with this loss, I was leading going into the last day, but by a slim 1/2 game with 4 tough competitors breathing down my neck. This would be no cakewalk.
