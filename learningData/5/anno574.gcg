#note I'm not exactly sure why I didn't play the extra S for 3 more points. Maybe embarrassment about getting all 4 S's.

#note Highly questionable to open the board like this. RIAS (12D,21) is much safer.

#note I still had decent hopes of winning at this point, holding the high-pointers and considering the not-great tile pool. I suppose I could have tried to block with ZIN (14F), but that seems a little wacky.
