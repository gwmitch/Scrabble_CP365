#note Not entirely clear what's best here, but this wasn't it. Shedding the U seems to be more important than saving the 1st E of the game. AHEM 9I scores the most, but leaves the ugly NOU and is defensively weak. MEOU (9J) sims best, but it is a significant point sacrifice and the AHN leave doesn't seem super strong. I suppose blocking the GLOOM extension accounts for some of the difference. HUE or HUM at 7K or 9K are also reasonable choices.

#note Another weak move - HONORER (K7) looks best.

#note Inexplicably, I was convinced that ANGULATE was an adjective. This must be close to the ultimate humiliation - to unsuccessfully challenge your own word.

#note After that horrible start, I got back on track for a few turns.

#note  Now this, I'm pretty sure was wrong. I wanted to do something about the AQUA hook, but this really opened up too much, and didn't get enough value out of the good tiles I had been drawing.

>Bing: ADDLOSU D9 D..D +18 335
#note LAYED is probably an improvement. Interestingly, LAYED at D8 sims better than at F8 for 2 more points, I guess since it takes out the 12D hotspot, one of the few places to score on this board.

#note According to Quackle, XU M10 wins 10% more often. I don't quite understand this; I thought the X could wait, and opponent might open a better spot for it. But there is a lot to be said for flexible tiles in the endgame. Better still would be to block the C3 bingo lane while setting up the X, with either LAUAN 7D or OUD 9B.

#note Very bad. Opponent just played off 3 consonants, so the likelihood of his having the remaining 3 (NRT) are fairly high. If that's the case then the bingo (INERTIA/ARENITE/NITERIE) is about an 80% chance, so this time I think OUD is clearly best.

#note Really unbelievable that any player in this division would miss this bingo. I guess neither of us wanted to win.
