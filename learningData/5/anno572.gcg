#note Another interesting opening rack problem. This time, taking the points with BINNED might be best, since it is fairly defensive. But it seems a shame to break up this promising rack. BIND or NIB (better than BIN) are the other major choices. I thought it was pretty close, but opted for the middle ground of BIND, although the I-hook was slightly dangerous.
