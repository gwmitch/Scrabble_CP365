#note Here's where things fell apart. It seems bizarre, but somehow I sort of spaced on the glaring S-hook on the board. I got fixated on the threat of HEMPIEST O1, in which case I might need some more ammunition to score with. Of course I should have seen that the many possible bingos were the real concern, and blocked with TURACO (K10). In fact, Jerry would have played HEMPIEST and pulled out the win anyway, but failing to block was a huge misstep.

#note Terrific game, and an awesome comeback by Jerry. It's too bad he couldn't quite pull out the championship this year, but I'm sure he'll be back.
