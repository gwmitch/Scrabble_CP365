#note Nothing was very appealing here. Don't ask why I didn't play CAY instead, undoubling the A's. However, COY seems to sim the best, only at the 9E placement. I guess this cuts down on counterplays, though it does allows WE- or PE- starting plays underneath, or -TH/-TY plays on top.

#note Normal aggressive move. I suppose TOEA (D2) would have been safer but it's not my style.

#note EX (3F,23) was a possibility, but I was hoping for a better score for the X. It may not have been the percentage play, but it worked out great this time.

#note Not a very good play. Drawing all the E's made me a huge favorite to win, and I'd be likely to have something at 1L if I just left the spot alone. I think I was worried about something like FILUM (3J), but OWE actually set up worse possibilities, like UNFOLD. VOE or VEE (3G, 15) would take care of FILUM and get rid of the V; emptying the bag with EAVE (3F,19) would probably be fine too.
