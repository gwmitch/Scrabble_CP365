#note Maybe I should trade again.  Quackle prefers -NNN, but it's looking dire in any case.  I felt I needed to do something creative.  So I set up another high scoring bingo lane and created the possibility of drawing 14 different bingos, if I could just get some vowelage.
>JM: BGIOS O5 BIGOS +32 116
#note So he takes out one of the spots, and I've still not seen a vowel.  I need to keep rolling the dice and increasing the volatility.  I think the previous move and the next one were my two best moves of the game.

#note WOE 14J is definitely stronger, though at least my move has the advantage of opening up another part of the board.

>Dave: AEGIOOR I2 GOOIER +18 89
#note A tough choice here, and Quackle doesn't help much.  There are many plays that don't sim too far apart from each other.  My two favorites are the one I played and GOO I5.  My move has the advantages of clearing out a vowel heavy rack quickly, scoring a bit more, setting up plays with the A from H1, giving myself the best chance of drawing the remaining blank, and scoring the most.  GOO has the advantages of playing fewer tiles and delaying the end of the game, retaining some good bingo letters, and creating an -ING ending bingo lane that is unlikely to be blocked for a while.  But of course GOO leaves a very vowel heavy rack, and I could easily suffer a bad draw again, especially with the huge number of A's and E's still out.  A close choice.

#note BEEF L1 is the star play here.  For some reason I thought about EF in that spot, but not BEEF.  Last day tournament fatigue?

#note Alright!  After starting out down 10-134, I'm within three points, and I'm about to draw a *really* great rack.
>JM: AEFINR A7 REF.AIN +33 255
#note This rack is an embarrassment of riches.  I have lots of big scoring plays with the Z, and even REFRAINED holding the Z to score later.  After considering the choices for a while, I had rounded it down to either ZEP L2, which is best from a pure equity point of view (points and leave), or SPATZLE D7, which I really liked because it takes a slight lead and does three things which put me in a great position to win the game: 1) Leaves the D and gives a very good chance to draw one of the three remaining E's for REFRAINED.  2) Makes the board harder for him to bingo back.  3) Turns over a lot of tiles to beat him to the blank and the remaining scoring tiles.  But while I'm trying to decide between these two great plays, I noticed the double-double line.

#note I was so disgusted with myself, I didn't even bother to finish my tracking, realize there was only one tile in the bag, or look at what he had.  Obviously, it's better to play off the Z first with HAD or AD.  But it's not going to make a difference in the result.
