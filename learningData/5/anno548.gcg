#note yipes!  I missed KALIFATE and ANTILEAK.  I've seen both words, had a better chance of finding the latter.  lame.
>Judy_Kass: HNO L4 HON +24 54
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AEGILNT 8A GELATIN. +80 101
#note quackle never fails at reminding me how my game needs more work.  missed the dub-dub GELATINE for 12 more points.  I do like how my play opens up the board.  but still....lame.
>Judy_Kass: BY 5K Y.B +26 80
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ?DFIORV M3 FI. +21 122
#note yet another miss:  FRIVOLED (C3, B2) and DISFAVOR (D4).  I thought about FRIVOLED but convinced myself that i was smoking something.  I know FRIVOLOUS so I would believe FRIVOLS but couldn't reason it being a verb (or adjectival).  lame.

#note yay! quackle approves.
>Judy_Kass: EQRU F6 QU.RE +36 135
#note I hate the Q.  happy to see it gone.
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: GIILNOP D1 PIGNOLI. +78 286
#note I recently came across PIGNOLI in my SuperMemo studies.  Fortunately I have the hooks on the flashcards since the 7 wouldn't play.
>Judy_Kass: JMU 1A JUM. +45 180
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: CDEIMNY 2B ME.NY +48 334
#note quackle approves again.  I was unsure about MEINY and thought for a bit before playing it. only at this point did i see the juicy 8L spot but didn't see a play that scored as much.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: CDIIRVX N6 VID +23 391
#note yes, i know the H is still out there.  at this point in the game i'm not too worried.  i've been making "risky" plays like this more often lately (without the large lead) and have not gotten burned as often as i thought i would.  my intuition on when to make such plays needs time to mature.  quackle prefers to use my D to hook onto QUIRE.  which i totally missed.  lame.  
>Judy_Kass: ?ENORST 11C mONSTER +77 284
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ACEIRUX L10 .URIAE +27 418
#note what am i doing?!?  i missed EAUX and CRUX (12A) which are much safer plays.  my play sucks so much quackle doesn't even list it.  and with good reason.  the leave is horrible.  i was getting greedy and wanted to save my X for a big play at H11. lame.
>Judy_Kass: ALT I3 TAL. +12 296
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: CLORSTX H11 .XTOL +60 478
#note the gamble pays off.  things really are going my way here.
>Judy_Kass: AET G11 .EAT +19 315
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ACERSSW 5C S.W +14 492
#note bingoing out would be sweet.  i give myself a chance at it.  hopefully she has the H and uses it on the next play at O8 to keep the bingo lane open.
>Judy_Kass: HO O8 HO +33 348
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AACEERS A8 .EARCASE +92 584
#note and the lane stays open. and despite a slew of misses, i have my highest live scrabble game ever.  the end.
