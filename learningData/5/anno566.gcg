#note TOURISTA (H8,77) looks best, but James makes an argument for taking the safer bingo: "TOURISTA I saw but I really didn't want to play...Is 11 points worth forfeiting for a little bit more security? Mostly, it had to do with whether or not I thought leaving the S, T and A in dually open position via TOURISTA was enough of a dissuasion."

#note FAVELA (H10,48) is much better here.
>Bing: NOOOORY -NYOOOO +0 79
#note The horrible 4 O draw put a serious damper on my winning chances. Already down over 100, I had to exchange and hope for a couple of quick bingos to get back in the game.

#note James saw BIFFED (A10,45) but wasn't sure of it.

#note Just what the doctor ordered. Still, I wasn't out of the woods yet.

>JL: AEIJMNO E5 JIAO +26 335
#note James had some interesting thoughts on this position: "I played JIAO to block up a lane, and because it was the best way to play off my J that I could see. ANOMI[E] 8A 33 may be better though it doesn’t really help me block. [F]AME 13A 33 is not bad, but ANOMIE likely makes more sense if you’re not playing to try and block. MEO[W] 12L 30 helps to possibly set up J[OE]Y N11 47 (and is likely not to be blocked if I do draw it)… Problem with FAME and MEOW, as compared to ANOMIE, is the huge number of I’s and N’s left in the bag, but if I hold onto the J it might be worth it as I might get to play off with JINNI some other time." 
>Bing: ?ABILNS 13A .AB +26 304
#note If not for that annoying JIAO play, LeSBIAN would have completed the comeback nicely. Still, I was in pretty good shape, closing within 31 and keeping S-Blank.
>JL: DEGMNNO B6 GNOME +19 354
#note I think I would have gone with MONGOE (8A,33). But GNOME was much more defensive, making it very difficult for me to bingo.
>Bing: ?ILNOSY A7 OY +32 336
>JL: ADENNOW J8 .OW. +30 384
#note Probably ENOW (C7,31) is best, but there's nothing seriously wrong with ROWS.
>Bing: ?HILNQS L12 Q.pH +38 374
#note An agonizing choice. I just didn't see a lot of hope for the obvious-looking move of QIS (M2,24). I would be down by fifty or so after James' next play, and the likelihood of making up that deficit was not good. It seemed worth it to burn the blank for the extra points, since bingoing was out of the question.  
>JL: ADENNNO C8 NAN +19 403
>Bing: AIIKLNS M11 LI. +14 388
#note Success would require drawing an E for a play at H1, and I would also need to be able to go out in 2 for decent points. I'm not sure I found the best play, but it was a reasonable shot and would have worked had I not spent way too long deciding on it. Between the last move and this one, I made the critical error of letting my time run down much too low for comfort in the endgame. (And of course, James had been making his plays at lightning speed throughout). So I was well under a minute going into the last rack, never a good idea, and in this case provoking a game-losing blunder. 
>JL: CDEINOU 7K .IDE +23 426
#note A great play, and more important, a very quick play. Quackle suggests that UNDO (F2,16) may win more cases, but this is debatable.
>Bing: AEIKMNS 3L MIS +18 406
#note I couldn't have asked for a better 2-tile draw. The hoped-for E gave me KNAVE for 36, and MIS would go out for 18. But there was a snag; James would simply go out with NUNCIO. With the seconds ticking down, my thought process only got as far as switching the order of the plays. The winning sequence, which I saw immediately afterward, was to simply play MI instead of MIS. Then I could go out with either KNAVES or SNAKE (2J,34).
