>Tunnicliffe: DEEGLMV 8D DEVEL +22 22
#note I figured the difference between this and VEG would be small, but... it's not. The defence from VEG is really valuable. Also... DELVE? How do I miss these things?
>Tremblay: GORSZ -  +0 0
>Tunnicliffe: CEEGMRY D8 .ECRY +22 44
#note I need to stop thinking it's okay to hold the G. GYRED, GEY, GREYED, GREEDY. Need to unload the GY and that seems so obvious in hindsight. Tired...

#note Convinced myself GEMMA(E) wasn't good :-(

#note She had TARBOOSH!
>Tunnicliffe: EEFILNO M2 FOE +24 185

#note In hindsight I like TIMEOUTS better. I shouldn't open the dangerous N column with an S. She's gonna get a J or Q six there.
