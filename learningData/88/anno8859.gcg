>pete: AINNRUW 8G NUN +6 6
#note Championship player recommends WAUR in a couple of places, or an exchange into -RAIN. WAUR is one of those words which seems to be the right play when it's available to you (even more so, something like VROUW). 
>hecky: EIMOOPR 7F POMO +20 20
#note CP prefers playing the same word downstairs, or a fish of ONO G7 (I'm never doing that). I considered both POMO spots in my mind before deciding on the top shelf; now I see why that's wrong. Maybe I should put both plays on the board as I make up my mind, but I've always hated doing that, even as I don't think it's technically against the rules. Anyone have an opinion on that?
>pete: AEGIKRW 9F KEG +19 25
#note No spot for the bingo. CP's top choice is WEIR 6G, which scores 23 and doesn't offer much back. 
>hecky: AEEGIRR 10H GEAR +15 35
#note I never feel confident playing this type of rack/position. My play shows up fourth, after REI 10D, ERA 10D and RAGI 10C. I knew I had to unduplicate the R and I didn't see any reason to hold a G, and all logical plays obviously score poorly and open the board for Pete. 
>pete: AADDIRW K5 AIRWA.D +44 69
#note Nicely done, Pete. I always felt this is the type of play where you know you're seeing things well, a non-bingo double double that's not obvious.
>hecky: DEINORR 5F REORD.IN +59 94
#note I'm a 53-percent favorite after this, all else equal.
>pete: DDEFLTV 4E DEFT +19 88
#note Nothing really good available here. CP recommends VEND M3, FLIT L3, FELID or FETID L2. All plays close. Pete's down to 33-34 percent winning chances no matter what he does. 
>hecky: EJLOPTY 11E JOEY +40 134
#note CP would rather go to bat with JOLTY 11D, which I considered. I thought JOLTY made it too easy to score if he had an O, but maybe I should just take the two extra points, better leave and extra pick and get on with my life.
>pete: ABBDLTV L2 DAV.T +20 108
#note CP's choice is VID; this is second on valuation. Note that DAVIT sets up the possibility of a huge Z play at J6, something I was blinded to for the rest of the game (Pete was not). It's funny how the construction of the board (in this case, the consonant at J5) can turn some people (me) into a blue hair.
>hecky: ?ILOPTT 12D TOP +23 157
#note I knew this rack had a bingo with the blank as an S, took a healthy turn, couldn't find it. A bunch of fishes are close to even, with this leading the win percentage.  
>pete: ?BBEILL 13C LIB +24 132
#note If you know the top 26,000 eights, you bingo on this turn. Quackle also likes taking the 11 extra points in the LIB spot with LIBEL. 
>hecky: ?EILOTU 2E OUTLIvE. +60 217
#note Again, took a decent turn, and sadly didn't find the one best bingo, the one clear play here, an easy play. There are also three bingos that score 62 (instead of my 60) that shouldn't be hard finds. Not a blunder, but a sub-optimal turn, no doubt.
>pete: ?BEHILS 14B BoLSHIE +105 237
#note Very nice. Pete's win percentage is a shade under 50 percent now.
>hecky: AEGIRTU 15H TRIAGE +33 250
#note The recommended play here is TEGUA, saving IR and scoring six less. I can see that. I drop 3.2 valuation points and about 3 win-percentage points here. 
>pete: Q J14 Q. +31 268
#note Don't have Pete's full rack here. This is likely a no-brainer no matter what he held. 
>hecky: AFLNSUW 1A FLAWS +47 297
#note I saw and settled on this pretty quickly, not seeing the better AWFUL in the same spot. AWFUL scores nine less but NS is a much better save to the remaining pool than NU. It's probably not so much about keeping the S - there are two unseen - as it is about keeping the consonants.
>pete: EHIMNRZ 13G HM +25 293
#note Quackle likes the options from 8K, WHINE over WINZE and WIZEN. Given the likelihood of ADZ eventually, WHINE looks good. More picks for an A, too, or for the sure-to-be-useful X.
>hecky: CCEIINU 8K .INCE +33 330
#note Second best, an eyelash behind LEUCIN (which I didn't see) for a nice bailout at B2 (and an extra pick, and one less vowel in the clunky leave). The unseen pool is odd - there's some seaweed, but there are two major scoring tiles as well.
>pete: EINNRSZ 3K R.IN +10 303
#note Top CP choices are ZING L12, INNERS N10, RINSE N2 and RENINS N10. Maybe ZA at 9J is also a consideration. I suppose if I already have the X, it could be hard for Pete to win from this position. 
>hecky: CEIOOTU 15A COTE +32 362
#note Curious for opinions here. COTE or COOT in the same spot make sense, but LUETIC at B1 leaves one in the bag and affords me an extra pick that might mean something. I think I saw the 60-point lead I was signing up for (Pete had underscored one of his plays) and thought I would be okay, even if given an awkward last rack. LUETIC is better.
>pete: EENSVYZ B1 .EVY +20 323
#note CP spits out AVE at C1, which I'll admit I don't initially understand. EVES N12 and LEVY B1 follow. All are given low win percentages, with the assumption that the X isn't in the bag (even though it is).
>hecky: AAIOSUU 1H AA +14 376
#note If you sim this position and the plies to "many" it will claim moves that win 100 percent. If you ask CP, it says this position is hopeless. Maybe I don't know how to use Quackle. At this point I had assumed his next play would be ZAXES N11, a play I can outrun. If I see the ADZ potential, I'm not sure blocking it does any good, since I'm giving up a giant AX play at 1H. 
>pete: AENSXZ J4 A.Z +65 388
#note I got a little pale when this went down. Funny how you can be blind to a spot. To Pete's credit, he was aware of it all along.
>hecky: IOSUU 11K .UI +4 380
#note This guarantees me an out next turn, hopefully ONUS N2 for optimum points. Either way, game is sunk. Outplayed.
>pete: ENSX 3B .EX +26 414
#note The slightly-preferred path is taking EX at N4, which blocks my best out. It will turn a 12-point win into a 16-point win (assuming my out next turn; he could win bigger if I extend the game). Big deal.
>hecky: OSU N2 O.US +18 398
#note A close loss, an enjoyable game. A better player could have won in my shoes, certainly. Well played, amigo.
>hecky:  (NS) +4 402
