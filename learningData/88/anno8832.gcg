#note This is Collins.  Go figure.  Best is c(H)ENILLE.  Also: NELLIES, TENAILLE, LINEABLE, LINEABLE, LOBELINE, LONELIER, and NIELLOED, some of which I saw, some I didn't.

#note Should be FLEX, but this blocks the 3WS.

>Ryan_Fischer: AFGIJLP 7H JIG +21 130
>Matthew_Bernardina: AAKNRSU 6I KA +19 137
#note Best play that keeps the S.  With 3 unseen, though, AUKS, ANKUS, KNAURS, or RAKUS aren't that bad.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEFLP K3 CLEF +28 158
#note A11 FE 22 is okay.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABENRSU 5C UNBEARS +75 212
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEIPR A11 PEA +24 182
#note PIE is less "DIRE" -- hehe.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEIIORU 3K .URIO +14 196
>Matthew_Bernardina: AENOSVV O1 AV. +18 248
#note Matt said he didn't play VIVA 'cause he didn't want to open an easy lane.  Q says VIVA is 82% vs AVO 76% after simming for a bit.  I can understand his hesitance, but ENOS looks pretty tempting.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIIITZ D1 DIZE. +34 230
>Matthew_Bernardina: CDENOSV 3B CO.EN +32 280
#note 2A NOV(I)CE 26?
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIOTT 1A TIE. +15 245
#note Hated this rack.  Meh.  9H GITE leaving IO?  Hmm...
>Matthew_Bernardina: DELNRSV 2G L.V +6 286
#note Right as rain.  I'm sunk.
>Ryan_Fischer: BGHIMOT 9H GHI +22 267
#note Doesn't make too much of a difference what I play here.  BIGHT is 21% to win, though.  This is only 11%
>Matthew_Bernardina: DENRSST K3 ....S +22 308
#note Oh yeah, I forgot.  Now I'm sunk!  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: BGMNOPT G4 B.G +10 277

>Matthew_Bernardina: DEINRST 13E .NDITERS +64 372
#note Or NITRIDES
>Ryan_Fischer: IIMNOPT 12H PI +16 293
#note Champ says I13 (T)I 2 is best.  Fish for TAMPION etc and maybe some other things.  PI is 2nd.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?AAOSTY H12 ..TY +27 399
#note ATEMOYAS no go!  TATOUAYS, too.  Fun rack.  Probably some other stuff too.  L1 TA(U)On S 28 blocks my bingo and scores best.
>Ryan_Fischer: IMNOOTY M1 MO.ONITY +64 357
#note I put this down as a joke.  Didn't think it was actually good until he was all like "oh, MORONITY, of course!"  :)
