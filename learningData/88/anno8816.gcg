>Will: ILNOORT 8G LO +4 4
>Eric: DEEIJSY 7F DEY +16 16
#note He has a bingoey rack.  This makes it difficult, I think, to bingo without opening a x3 lane.
>Will: IINNORT 6B INTRO +14 18
>Eric: EIJOSTT C3 JOI.T +26 42
#note I figure Will didn't have a bingo, else he would play short last turn.  So, he probably didn't have an S.  So, I'll take the 3/83ish chance he doesn't draw one and have a big play.
>Will: FINORUX D2 FOX +53 71
#note aww
>Eric: EEIKOST 8A KIS +34 76
#note Not great.  I liked that this set up the T, KETO E1 is much better.
>Will: AEINRSU H7 ..U +6 77
>Eric: DEENOTW D8 TOWED +29 105
#note KNOTWEED.  "a common weed."  NOT.
>Will: AEINRRS 5F SIERRAN +68 145
>Eric: DEEEGNT K1 TEEN.GED +60 165
#note Kind of a lucky draw.  I'll take it.
>Will: AADGOPV H1 AGAV. +39 184
>Eric: AEEIOPY 8K .OPEY +36 201
#note Sime likes TEPOY to kill the more dangerous x3 line.
>Will: DENOPUZ 2J Z.P +34 218
>Eric: ACEILUW 9L WILE +25 226
>Will: ADEHNOU E9 HONED +35 253
>Eric: ACCEIIU -ACCIIU +0 226
>Will: ABEINSU 1K .UBAE +29 282
>Eric: ?AEFLLO 10K LEAF +40 266
>Will: AINRRSS 11H NARIS +21 303
>Eric: ?AHLOQU N1 .QUA +26 292
#note Sim doesn't like how this gives him a vowel to play through, for CUM, BUM, or VUM, I'd guess.  It recommends at 12G, where it also opens up a lane.
>Will: ?BMRRSV 3M V.M +16 319
>Eric: ?AHILMO I8 OH +21 313
#note Given the lack of vowels in the pool, OHM/HOLM at C aren't that bad.  It's unlikely he can make a great play even with the S.  Also, his last play suggests he is Consonant heavy.
>Will: ?BCIRRS 3F CR.B +12 331
#note Yup. 
>Eric: ?AIILMU 6K .AUM +15 328
#note Had no idea what to do here.  Sim suggests blocking the K.  crazy!
