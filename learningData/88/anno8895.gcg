>Mark_Edward_Owens: IO 8G OI +4 4
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADDHIY G6 HY.ID +17 17
#note Spent a while, but it'd take me forever and a day to find HYDATID. :)  I played HYOID to bingo faster and perhaps get some equity out of the -S hook which doesn't look like it should be.  Sacrifices points but limits his options too.  Surprised it doesn't do better.
>Mark_Edward_Owens: ABEIMRS F5 BAM +23 27
#note Told me his rack here.  He didn't know the hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEEMP 10G .AMPErED +73 90
#note This rack looks aaaaawfully familiar (think PREARMED from a couple games ago).  Thisz bogus.  DAMPER is a noun.  Haha.  DAMPENED and DECAMPED are good though.
>Mark_Edward_Owens: ?EIRSTU K4 RETInU.S +78 105
#note If you know HYOIDS, there are several 101-point bingos along row 11!
>Ryan_Fischer: CDKOUVW 4J V.OUW +22 112
#note 8J U(n)DOCK 42 (coming up for the 2nd time this tourney as well!).
>Mark_Edward_Owens: IQ J7 QI +23 128
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEKNSU O4 SUCKED +55 167
#note I was wondering about the 8s with this rack. There are two: UNCASKED is good!  I was wondering!  As is SUNDECKS.  :)
>Mark_Edward_Owens: EGOR M2 RO.GE +12 140
>Ryan_Fischer: BLNRSXY M9 B.RYL +26 193
#note I'm not taking the S hook yet when I don't think he knows it.  It's an ace in the hole (unless a situation comes up where he gets to try it out of desperation).  So I'm happy with this though it's 4 back of BYRLS.

#note Lost challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORTUZ A11 .RAZE +51 429
#note Oh, I so wanted to play OUTCRAZE*.  :)  Gotta take the C, so OYEZ is out, as is ZOEAE.  Playing CRAZE 'cause lotsa As left.  Oddly, Champ says CROZE is 100%, and this is 99.24.  Go figure.

#note Saw ZEALOT, forgot about ZONUL/E/A/AE.  ZONULA Champ likes best.  This, though...
>Mark_Edward_Owens: AFGGNOT -  +0 341
