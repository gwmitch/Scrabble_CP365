>Ryan_Fischer: AFINORR 8D INFRA +18 18
#note 8D FRIAR 24.  Matt's graciously provided his racks.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DEEIIPU G7 P.IEDIEU +66 66
#note Yay!
>Ryan_Fischer: DFINORS H11 OF +21 39
#note There's a game a friend taught me when playing her particular coffeeshop brand of Scrabble.  Make the most horrible pun you can along with your play.  "Of (RINDS) and men."
>Matthew_Bernardina: AGGILOW E3 GLOWI.G +24 90
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDINRS 5A SARD.NIC +61 100
#note I can also play this as a nongo 2x2 for 44!
>Matthew_Bernardina: AAENOOT A1 TOEA. +18 108
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILOQT 14F Q.OTA +36 136
#note Put down QUAIL, then changed it to QUOTA.  Q likes QUOIT.  Champ 2ply likes QUOIT as well.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEMNOTU 15H NOTUM +40 148
>Ryan_Fischer: BEHILLP B2 PHI.L +39 175
#note B2 PLI(A)BLE 46 static.  This is obviously better though.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AACEEEM 4D A.E +14 162
>Ryan_Fischer: ABELTXY F10 YA +30 205
#note Missed a whole buncha stuff - (P)YX, (GLOWING)LY, XYLE(M), and BEAT(IF)Y.  Some better than others, some arguably silly as is the case with most Q static choices.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEEIMV 13J MAVIE +25 187
#note H1 ACMI(C) 36
>Ryan_Fischer: BEILTTX 14N XI +36 241
>Matthew_Bernardina: CEHNOSV N9 CONV.. +20 207
#note Clever, and best.
>Ryan_Fischer: BDELTTZ E11 DEB +24 265
#note Missed ZETA, but would get it next turn after spending a LONG time trying to find it.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEEEHJS D12 HAJ +40 247
#note Best by far, even with the 3 E leave.  Though... I might be tempted to try HAE setting up JEES.  Too risky though with all its other hooks, and the points don't quite make up for it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELRTTUZ K10 ZET. +26 291
#note Something about this rack made it really hard to see ZET(A).  I'd wonder about RELU(C)T later but didn't want to open those lanes.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DEEEOSY 10I DO.E +16 263
>Ryan_Fischer: EELRTTU 11J R.TU.E +10 301
#note Really don't want to open anything here.  Closing it down.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EEORSUY H1 SOUR.E +27 290
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEGLST 2H .TALGiES +70 371
#note I didn't think bingoing was best but I'm not sophisticated enough to find a better play.  Champ says it's C9 GELTS 32 88%.  I don't know.  In reality I'm just happy to get mine down and hope he can't reply.  Was considering if STAgGLES* is good but it's STRAGGLE.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EKLNSWY M1 W.NKLES +28 318
#note 1M KYE 46
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BINRR 15A aBRI +33 404
#note Missed my outs of BARRING and BARNIER.  ROBIN, BURIN, BRUIN, and BRAIN are better, too.
>Matthew_Bernardina: Y 10N .Y +10 328
>Matthew_Bernardina:  (NR) +4 332
