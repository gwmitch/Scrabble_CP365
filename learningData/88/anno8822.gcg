#note Sim prefers BURG. Potential setup + better defense?

#note Really close to INFIX, which I just didn't see. I kind of like INFIX. ZINGER gives him bingo lines, but a potential Z comeback for me.

#note I think I spent way too much time considering CITIFY for the defense. Glad I came to my senses. This is way better.

#note Eh. This is a do-nothing play. There are no decent points, so I should be killing bingo lanes. F4 DUI makes it hard for Adam to open that quadrant of the board. FUCI and FUCK are not as dangerous as I had thought. No As left makes FUCK pretty safe. I was too worried about leaving the V open. But he isn't going to score 60+ there, so why play VID?
>Logan: BLOPW 3B PLOWB.. +32 279
#note Yeah. Good reason for DUI.
