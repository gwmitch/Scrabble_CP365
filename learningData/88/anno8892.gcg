#note A nice easy rack to start with.....

>Stefan: EEGILMR H1 GRIME +35 108
#note GLIME in the same spot is a hair better, of course. I'm doubting myself far too much on fours and fives recently....time to brush up.

#note You know, my baby bingos aren't going to be enough if he keeps it up with that kind of shit....
>Stefan: ENOOPRY N1 .POONY +38 251
#note I came dangerously close to trying SPOONERY* here. For once, good sense won out. 
>Joel_Sherman: AINOSTU O6 AUTO +17 301
#note Joel's actual rack.....he mentioned after the game that I'd blocked (T)ITANOUS.
>Stefan: DEINORU K3 NEUROID +70 321
#note Baby bingo #3. Woot! I was not feeling quite silly enough to play at N9. 
>Joel_Sherman: INPS M3 SNIP +28 329
>Stefan: AAFHLNQ -AAFLNQ +0 321
#note A lovely momentum-killer of a rack. This is probably the best exchange, although Quackle slightly prefers a few stupid little plays like N8 ALFA, 12J DHAL, 7E FAN, or 8M QAT. Those are all stupid. 
>Joel_Sherman: EFT L8 FET +24 353
>Stefan: BEHIRSU N9 BUSHIER +82 403
#note A lucky six-tile draw leads to baby bingo #4! See if you can guess what happens next. 
>Joel_Sherman: ?EIKNOV 15H INVOKE.s +221 574
#note Yes, that is what happened. I gave Joel the finger SO HARD when he turned his head to draw his new tiles. 
>Stefan: AAILRRT 12L RA. +12 415
#note What the heck, let's fish for another bingo. 
>Joel_Sherman: Q H14 Q. +11 585
>Stefan: AEILRTT 6A TERTIAL +67 482
#note Yes! Baby bingo #5! Oh, wait, I think I'm still going to lose. 
>Joel_Sherman: AAACFGJ C3 JAG.A +28 613
>Stefan: EN O1 .EN +10 492
>Stefan:  (ACF) +16 508
#note Draw like a madman, play pretty well, and lose by 105. This game is so stupid.
