>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAENSU H7 NAUSEAs +64 64
#note The other bingos: SAUNAEd and gUANASE.
>Wesley_Yocom: AX G8 AX +36 36
>Matthew_Larocque: AKLORWZ 7E LAW. +28 92
#note Forgot about LOWN, but they are basically even in the sim. 
>Wesley_Yocom: ?ABEOSU E3 ABSO.UtE +68 104
#note Scored as 70.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABFKPRZ 11C ZARF +52 144
#note I was totally taking a shot in the dark here. I just couldn't stop myself from throwing this down and seeing his reaction. I figured he would burn a lot of time thinking about it, and there was a reasonable chance that this was valid. This final game would decide who got 3rd place, the loser would get 5th or 6th. Sometimes you gotta take a risk!
>Wesley_Yocom: PRTTY -  +0 104
#note Yes!
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEKNPR D10 B.NKED +34 178
#note I kind of zeroed in on the one corner, missed PR(A)NKED for 42. It's a big mess in the sim. KN(O)B for 26 is hovering around second, and my play is in the top 5.
>Wesley_Yocom: PRTTY 14B PR.TTY +26 130
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIOPRT 6C GO.P +23 201
#note I played this purely for the leave, but it's actually the clear sim winner. I'll take it!
>Wesley_Yocom: LOW 15G OWL +23 153
>Matthew_Larocque: EIJRSTT J9 JITTERS +75 276
#note Total fluke.
>Wesley_Yocom: DINY C3 DIN.Y +28 181
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEIIO K6 CIAO +15 291
#note This was kind of a tough choice. I also considered CIAO for 19 at B2, but opening the TWS for a few extra points didn't seem worth it. I saw O(K)E, but I must have missed A(K)EE which would have been great.
>Wesley_Yocom: ELRT 8K .LTER +18 199
#note ruh roh
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHILMU 15A HIE. +30 321
#note I didn't know (T)ELIUM which limits the new lines he just opened up.
>Wesley_Yocom: CFOR 12G F.C.OR +22 221
>Matthew_Larocque: ELMOOUV N3 VOLUM. +13 334
#note Barf. Well, this isn't totally rejected by the sim, it hovers around 6th place or so. I can't remember if I saw (C)LOVE, the sim's favourite play. 
>Wesley_Yocom: DEENRST I1 TENDERS +69 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHMNOV J2 HAEM +39 373
#note A large number of ways to score here, I missed a bunch like AN(T)HEM and HOME(R). However the modest scoring VE(T)O and the simple OH J1 are co-winners in the sim. Something to do with blocking the T here I'm guessing? Or trying to save some firepower to score well next turn. The H and M are both very versatile letters for hotspots so that makes sense.
>Wesley_Yocom: IQ F2 QI +33 323
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINOV 3L VI.E +20 393
#note I used up almost all of my clock here trying to max out my score. My idea here was to set up my D to play on the TWS next turn. I was also still aware of the K hotspot, I didn't think he'd spoil it if I left it alone. Oh, and there's a crazy 8 letter bingo here with 4 overlaps which would probably be the best play, ha! I totally didn't think of tacking a D on VOLUME, either.
>Wesley_Yocom: AGGIIIN 12G ......ING +17 340
#note Simulation says his best play is AIN G1 for 19 points, which lets him win 1.58% of the time. Um I'm pretty sure even if I pass all my turns, he STILL couldn't win here...
>Matthew_Larocque: DEENOOU O1 NE.D +26 419
#note I guess I was too preoccupied with my set-up that I didn't look for the new plays he made available. There's also OO(Z)E, (R)EDONE gives me an out in 2. Sim's best is (G)UDE for 18.
>Wesley_Yocom: AGII 1G GI. +12 352
#note (G)IGA
>Matthew_Larocque: EOOU 13C O.E +22 441
#note OO(Z)E
>Wesley_Yocom: AI L3 .IA +12 364
#note This was also my first victory against fellow up-and-comer Wes, certainly an eventful tourny for me! 
>Wesley_Yocom:  (OU) +4 368
