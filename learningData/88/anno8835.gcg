>Brad_Whitmarsh: AAFI L8 .AFIA +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEKORU 7G KUE +30 54
#note OKA K10 is stronger defensively and sims about even with this.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EEJSS 13I JESSE +51 71
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEHORR 14I OH +35 89
#note Neck and neck with HERO in the same spot. Both are awful defensively. Meh. Gut instinct was for points.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EILOOR 15D ORIOLE +31 102
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIRRU 11H AURE. +10 99
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ADEVW 12D WAVED +33 135
>Evans_Clinchy: DEINNPR 13A PINED +24 123
#note Pretty bad. I didn't know JESSE was a verb, else I'd definitely have played PINDER for 44. I also didn't really consider fishier plays like NAP E11 or NIP 9E. Played this quickly without thinking much.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AESTY N10 YEAST +45 180
>Evans_Clinchy: FNQRTTU B11 QU.NT +28 151
#note Sim suggests FRUIT in the same spot, which is a viable option since I still have the F14 spot for the Q anyway. But at this score, I'd rather ditch the Q and have a shot at bingoing sooner.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EIVW O7 WIVE +35 215
>Evans_Clinchy: CFGIRRT 6H FRIG +20 171
#note GRIFT is better, either here or at 9C. Why keep CRT when you can keep CR and dig deeper into the bag for blanks? There are three more T's anyway.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: OOOO -OOOO +0 215
>Evans_Clinchy: BCENRTX 9C BRENT +19 190
#note Sims best. I've got no qualms about waiting on the X, since there are a few half-decent spots for it.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: HO 11D OH +30 245
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDINTX O14 AX +29 219
#note TAX N6 is clever, scoring almost as much and opening a lane I could hit with an -IC or -ED bingo.

#note (desperation challenge)
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AAAGGO 4G AGOG +19 387
#note GOAD 2B, setting up GALA up top. Cool.
