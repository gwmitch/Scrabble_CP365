#note ADEST isn't a ton better than AEST. I might just wanna take the four extra points with DAK here.

#note NIX is interesting because it makes it tougher for Brad to overlap AX for a big score next turn, but this still looks better.

#note Sims best. AJEE 4L is statically nice but too open.

#note PUMP and HUMP play at L11, but I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous.

#note Revelation: Brad likes to score points.

#note Missing CLING J10 somehow. That would be way better. LN is gross.

>Evans_Clinchy: ILNNRRR 9F RIN. +15 317
#note Quackle slightly favors exchanging. I'm surprised. 15 points is a lot in a close game like this one, and LNRR seems like a salvageable leave considering the very vowel-heavy pool.

#note Many-ply sim suggests LOO or NOO at 15D. That is made of fail. I need more places to bingo. NOLO B4 is interesting, but perhaps too aggressive, as it's easy for Brad to take that lane out. This struck me as the right balance. It opens a bingo line with a little bit of specificity. I already have the case T, I have one E, etc. I have ways to hit that spot, and there's a slight chance it stays open for me.

#note I thought about this for a long time (like 12 minutes I think), and I became pretty convinced this was right. Fish the R, open another line, and there are two I's to be drawn for ELATION/TOENAIL. Turns out this is wrong, because as long as he has the D on his rack, he can score enough to outrun any bingo. He has plays like UREIDE/OREIDE in the bottom left, he has words in line A hooking DON, etc. So I need to fish for the D, because it's the only possible way to win. The correct play: KIN instead of KIR. If I draw the D after *that* fish, then he plays OURIE/KINE to block LEOTARD/KIND, and I hit DELATOR/DON and win 445-434. Nothing else works.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DEEIORU 15A UREIDE +29 445
#note Like I said -- even when I hit my miracle fish, the D helps him score enough to outrun me.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILNOT A5 TOENAIL +74 437
#note Tough loss.
