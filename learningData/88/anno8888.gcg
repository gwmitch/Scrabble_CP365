#note Q prefers that I also keep the T,  Perhaps it's better to keep a third consonant given that the vowel/consonant balance of the unseen pool is slightly more vowel heavy than normal, but as one expert told me, if you draw the wrong vowels, CHT could backfire.  Just personal preference, I'll draw 5 to CH.  Whether or not it was the best possible choice, it certainly worked out.

#note Everything wins 100% now, but either this or REV O7 (to block possible extensions like FLANKING or FLANKERS) is best.   With this lead I just wanted to turn the extra tile and empty the bag as quickly as possible; I wasn't concerned with building a rack.   ENVY L10 balances the rack better but now he'll have to find a 9 if he wants to bingo to save spread.  And Quackle is much better at finding those than humans.

#note Wasn't focusing on writing my racks down by this point and am not entirely sure what I had.  I do recall that I debated whether or not to play it safe with something like JO M12 or JOT 6B. Worst casing it, I saw AZINE coming back for 50, and with this lead I figured I could get away with this.  From this rack fragment, Q agrees with me - while everything wins 100%, this is best.
