>Steve: AGNOV H8 GANOV +26 26
#note Yeah, I held for a little while, but I wasn't sure enough to challenge. I got away with GANIF (against a different opponent) earlier this year, so the karma should be even now.
>Bill: EEHILNV 11G H.VEL +22 22
#note Quackle actually suggests playing HE and rolling the dice with the V leave. I was thinking maybe just HOVE instead... EILN is pretty good, and there's no point in setting up just front and back S-hooks with HOVEL when I currently have zero esses.
>Steve: ADGNORT J5 DRAGON.T +64 90
#note Only bingo.
>Bill: EIINOPU K11 .OUIE +7 29
#note Discouraged by the draw, and I figured I'd better do something to keep the board open, or else I could have a very brief window before it gets really ugly.
>Steve: BIZ 15H BIZ. +45 135
#note I7 BIZ 61.
>Bill: EEIINNP K2 PINE +18 47
#note Still reduced to setting up hooks for letters that I don't currently hold.
>Steve: DEMPSTU 3G DUMP.EST +86 221
>Bill: EIIKLMN I7 KI +27 74
#note Quackle does rate this slightly ahead of H1 NEUK. I didn't like killing the -ING possibility to the TWS, but I'm giving up the N playing NEUK anyway, so I stuck with the better leave.
>Steve: ORY H1 YO.R +24 245
>Bill: AEILMNO 1J LOMEIN +40 114
#note Disappointing that I missed SEMOLINA, especially since I once constructed an "I Am the Walrus"-themed game. Jokingly mentioned ALIMONEY.
>Steve: AA 14H AA +8 253
>Bill: ACDEORS J1 .O. +13 127
>Steve: AEELNRS 5B LEANERS +72 325
#note More defensive (and a point or two more) at F5 and L5. I can forgive Steve for not worrying about defense at this score.
>Bill: ACDERST A4 SCARTED +93 220
>Steve: ADEIILS F7 LIAISED +72 397
#note B9 SEDILIA for five more, but way less defensive. Now five bingos without seeing a blank.
>Bill: ?CFORTW D4 C.W +16 236
#note Dangit, I didn't dismiss this rack and I saw the CROWFOOT/CROWFEET possibility. CROWFEET comes sooo close to playing. It looks like a big mistake to block these nice lanes, but I didn't see anything good elsewhere, and I figured he would block them anyway, so I just tried to keep consonants that were playable on B9. After looking at Quackle's choices, L5 FROW seems to be a good idea.
>Steve: AIX 14K .XIA +22 419
>Bill: ?FORTTY 13M OFT +21 257
#note I should probably just take the points with 15M FRY, as I'm going to need a stroke of luck to draw into a bingo anyway. I kinda wanted to keep the Y to have a play ending -SY on column L as a backup plan for the blank. 9H AFOOT is a clever play scoring five more points with these same letters, but I don't know if I like it -- it kills the L column, and that lower right triple is unlikely to stay open unless he bingos elsewhere.
>Steve: RUUW -RUUW +0 419
>Bill: ?AEORTY B5 .YE +29 286
#note 15N YO might be worth the five point sacrifice, but I was still praying for an improbable triple-triple over there.
>Steve: UUW -UUW +0 419
>Bill: ?AJNORT 1F JO. +13 299
#note I came close to trying JANITORY.
>Steve: ?EEFHIT B9 HEFTIEr +88 507
#note C7 FITCHEE 94.
>Bill: ?AGNRTW M3 .TRAWiNG +66 365
>Bill:  (BQRUU) +32 397
