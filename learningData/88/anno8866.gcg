>Jason_Krueger: ADG 8G DAG +10 10
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEMNPR 7G AMA +19 19
#note There are countless plays here, the majority of them not differing too much in the sim. The simple PA 7H is the favourite though.  I suppose M > P so something like NAPA would have worked better. I didn't even know PREMAN.
>Jason_Krueger: EW 9H WE +19 29
>Matthew_Larocque: EHNPPRR J5 PEH +19 38
#note Pretty bad. Didn't know REPP, but PREP and PERP play in a few places. Should have been obvious - eliminate both duplicates.
>Jason_Krueger: AX K5 AX +35 64
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINPRR 4K PAR +22 60
#note LOL I seriosuly chickened on PARRING. Sim wants PIRN but that could cost me with 4 esses still at large.
>Jason_Krueger: EHO M2 HE.O +14 78
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINRSS N1 SANtIRS +85 145
#note Not quite the highest scoring, ARSINeS is 86. This one sims best though, and Jason had never seen it before. 
>Jason_Krueger: EIOUV -  +0 78
#note Challenged
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIORTZ 6A ZOoTIER +73 218
#note Pretty weak, EROTIZe plays in multiple areas for many more points, uncluding 93 at 9J.
>Jason_Krueger: EIOUV D4 OU.VIE +20 98
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIOTT A5 A.OTE +42 260
>Jason_Krueger: EEGNNSU M7 ENGENUS +75 173
>Jason_Krueger: EEGNNSU --  -75 98
#note Yikes, maybe he was thinking of INGENUES? Either way this was quite random, and if he challenged SANTIRS, how would he know a word like this? He wouldn't.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFILTYY C1 FLAY +25 285
#note "Now you're just toying with me" he says. Yeah I tried to abuse his otherwise clunky letters, what can I say.
>Jason_Krueger: EEGNNSU 10F GEN +17 115
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILTUY 1A DE.TLY +42 327
#note I thought this was a good play at the time, but I missed a whole whack of better ones. (F)LUTEY 39 (stupid word), (F)ETIDLY 42, even the simple DE(F)Y sims better. And (F)LUTED for 33. But I refuse to believe that sacrificing 9 points to keep YI instead of IU makes sense.
>Jason_Krueger: EMNSTUU M7 UNMUTES +79 194
#note Gah, this time I let his phony bingo go. This is a word I've used in daily life, so why shouldn't it be valid? Ridiculous dictionary allows you to "unsay" something, but not unmute the tv.
>Matthew_Larocque: IKNORTU 11I KNOU. +18 345
#note Jason didn't know this, Diablo II has taught me the names of many medieval weapons >_> Some aren't in there, like gladius, pilum, tulwar, and shamshir.
>Jason_Krueger: CDO 11E COD +18 212
>Matthew_Larocque: INQRRTV 12H QI +27 372
>Jason_Krueger: BG 9C B.G +9 221
>Matthew_Larocque: NNORRTV L10 N.N +12 384
#note I wasn't sure how to proceed. I can't score well, but I don't need to open the board with my huge lead either. This sims best, I must have just fluked it!
>Jason_Krueger: J 2M ..J +13 234
#note Jason noted that "this....is troublesome".
>Matthew_Larocque: BORRTTV N12 BORT +19 403
#note So, last turn I mentioned I didn't need to open the board even though I can't score. Well, now I just throw all of that out the window. I was that confident that a triple-triple was extremely unlikely with no blank and 5 unseen Is. I could have just played BOT instead, but I guess I wanted to test my choking ability with a 169 point lead!
>Jason_Krueger: EE E11 .EE +5 239
>Matthew_Larocque: DIORTVW 13G VID +34 437
#note Lol and I still leave the 3x3 open like a moron. After this play my lead was near 200, but if I had sacrificed this one play to kill the 3x3 I might have actually scored a crushing defeat instead of becoming a joke player.
>Jason_Krueger: ACEIILS 15H SILICA.E +167 406
#note I think I've read this on ingredients labels enough to know it. If I challenge here I actually end up losing by 3! Good god.
>Matthew_Larocque: FIORRTW D12 FROW +40 477
#note Underscored this by 4, because I need all the help I can get. Also went into overtime.
>Jason_Krueger: IL 10B LI +8 414
>Jason_Krueger:  (IRT) +6 420
#note I commented that I was a lucky son of a b****. Jason told me I deserved the win, but I still have my doubts on that. How do you lead by 200 on a dead board and win by 40-something? You don't unless you're trying to set some kind of record for biggest failure.
