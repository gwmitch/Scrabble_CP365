>Evans_Clinchy: EFFILOV 8H OFF +18 18
#note This is strong defensively, but the sim slightly prefers FIVE since the F is a good scoring tile for next turn. VOILE is in the mix too.
>Chris_Lipe: AO J6 OA. +8 8
>Evans_Clinchy: CEILRVZ G6 VICE +23 41
#note Didn't like LEZ 5J at all, despite the score. Why open up the Z for counterplay when there aren't any other good scoring spots and he'll snatch it up? This felt safer. I can always take LEZ later.
>Chris_Lipe: ?AGIQRU 9A QUAGgI.R +70 78
>Evans_Clinchy: EEHLRTZ 5J LEZ +31 72
#note ...like now.

>Chris_Lipe: BO D4 BO +18 148
>Evans_Clinchy: IIORRUY A12 .YRI +24 252
#note I can't bring myself to play ROUPY at this score. It just opens too much, and if he bingos and I draw crap to my two-I leave, I could suddenly be in trouble. This is so much safer.
>Chris_Lipe: GLU H12 .LUG +15 163
>Evans_Clinchy: ABIORTU L8 BU.RITO +24 276
#note I WIN! Actually, in my excitement I missed BURQA, so I suck.
>Chris_Lipe: DEOW 14J WO.ED +34 197
#note At this point, Chris calls the director and asks for permission to continue the game even though BURRITO has already been played. His request is granted, for some stupid reason.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAHIOTU L4 A.O +24 300
#note Sim likes UTOPIA 2B -- too open. THOU 13L -- interesting choice, but I like keeping a scoring tile for next turn. This is third.
>Chris_Lipe: ?AEEINS 3A pENA.ISE +71 268
>Evans_Clinchy: AAHITUX 4H XU +34 334
#note Yuck. I always forget to look through the blank. HA(p)AX.
>Chris_Lipe: EEILNTV 2H VEINLET +87 355
#note If I play HAPAX, he ain't got shit.
>Evans_Clinchy: AACDHIT 1L ADIT +26 360
#note Despite Marlon's insistence that I'm a knucklehead, I like this play. There are plenty of places to score with the H (A1 spot, 8L spot, B10 spot, etc), but I have a flexible rack and don't mind waiting to choose one. This scores almost as much as something like CAPH A1, and it's way stronger defensively. ACH is a great leave and I'm guaranteed to score well next turn, with CAPH or BACH or something else entirely. The sim says Chris's bingo percentage (under 6 percent) and average score (under 24) are way lower after ADIT than anything else.
>Chris_Lipe: EMS 15J EMS +26 381
>Evans_Clinchy: AAACDEH M7 AAH +24 384
#note Put down BACH, realized DIAPASON was a word, put down this instead. It's best.
>Chris_Lipe: ADINOPS A1 PO.S +18 399
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDE N5 ACED +21 405
#note Phew.
