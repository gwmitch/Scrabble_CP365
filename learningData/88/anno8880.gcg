#note Best, oddly.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEMPR N7 PREA.MeD +78 190
#note Wow, there are surprisingly few bingos here.  This, TRAMPED or CRAMPED, REVAMPED, and RAMPAGED.  Of note: 14J MADRE 44.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEILNST H7 L.... +8 223
#note I like L(AWNS) better than A(L) as it gives me two spots to bingo at least.
>Scott_Garner: OW M3 WO. +23 194
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEINST 4D ENTASIA +69 292
#note And it's here that I thought I had the game locked down.  But for serendipity!  Of note: SANATI(V)E.
>Scott_Garner: AZ 3G ZA +44 238
#note First bit of fortune, my bingo gives him a ZA counter which blocks QAT(S).
>Ryan_Fischer: AAINQTV E2 QA.AT +28 320
#note His blocking QAT(S) forces me to play QA(N)AT, opening up a slim bingo lane for him.  I guess I could have played QAI(D) 6I, avoiding this.  That's really hard to see.
>Scott_Garner: IMNRSTU D6 UNTRIMS +72 310
#note He hits a miracle!  And I hold, even though I'm pretty sure it's good.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIINNOV 14F VINO +24 344
#note I make an equity play even though I'm pretty sure it'll give him a decent comeback.  I lie to myself saying he's drawing 7 so his rack can't be that good.
>Scott_Garner: BDU 15G DUB +39 349
#note It's not, but it's enough to keep ahead!
>Ryan_Fischer: BDEEINR N2 DEB +23 367
#note If I played elsewhere there might be a spot for my no-go right now!  Of note: 3D B(A)I(ZA) 22.  This may give back too much, too.  I'm running low on time.
>Scott_Garner: CCILU 8A CUL.IC +30 379
>Ryan_Fischer: EFINOOR C7 O.E +11 378
#note And he's pulled ahead with a bingo line open, a bingo pool, and if I play the play I want to play, I empty the bag!  Aw crap!  So I quickly try to reconcile some sort of bingo leave (I can't really block), and try to save my F in case he doesn't hit the bingo.  It's too much information to process!  Oh, how brilliant Q is here: A8 (C)OO 5 sets up FINER for 45 and if I draw another O I still have my 32 elsewhere.  It's 67% to win.
>Scott_Garner: EEILORS A8 .REOLISE +83 462
