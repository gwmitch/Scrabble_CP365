>Ryan_Fischer: DGINOPR I4 PROD.ING +66 66
#note The difference when simming is really negligible.  Still, as careful as I was, I was off a bit.  I first put it at G4 and then shifted it to I4 so as to make it harder to hit H1.  I neglected to see the X spot it created, though.  I5 comes out on top for obvious reasons, but only by a point, and a half a win percentage.

#note Still horrible at finding non-bingo 2x2s, I miss OTAL(G)IC and OTAL(G)IA.  At least my play is 3rd.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?HNNORT 5B NORTH +21 203
#note Wanted to give myself as many ways as possible to open this thing up.  Maybe a mistake in light of my small lead.  NORTH/TACONITES is "safe", but still vulnerable, so I thought I'd just let him try to close it up.  I like it open.
>David_Gibson: ADGIU B1 AUDI.G +24 183
#note He took a LONG time here.

>David_Gibson: AELNRWX L4 ..R +7 190
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABEGHN M8 AH. +24 272
#note I didn't want to part with my G (MAJORING backdoor if I don't hit a bingo), so G(I)BE was out for me.  BAH is kinda dumb.  So, I settled on AH(S).  It's okay.  Can't really complain about how it turns out.
>David_Gibson: ?EINRST E7 cRETINS +73 263
#note I wonder which letter he drew after likely fishing off that 2nd R?
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEGNOY 14F BYGONEs +81 353
#note Well, he held but ultimately let it go.  I could play BYGO(N)E for 30 leaving N?  Lots of vowels in that bag, a slim chance I could still draw something good.  I really thought FEEBLES* was plausible.  It *is* Collins.

#note Yeah, I chickened out on O(V)ERLATE.  Sitting across from the champ, the win in my grasp, it just sounded silly.  Even still, I should have played OE to block Y(AG)I (according to Champ).  It leaves (D)ARTLE to go out.
