#note Okay, maybe VENTS is better.
>Mark_Schmidt: ?CEILOT M7 COaLIE.T +62 103
#note 9B LECTIOn 71 is the biggest score.  Also, EGLOgIT(E) and hELICO(P)T.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMNSVX 9H XI +24 75
#note I could see myself falling into a hole here if I didn't make the right play, but it eluded me here.  N9 MINX 33.  Considered M(A)X.  XI seemed alright after weighing other options.
>Mark_Schmidt: AIO L12 O.IA +22 125
>Ryan_Fischer: CEMNSSV -VCMSN +0 75
#note Well, yeah, 8M (O)MS 15, unless you're worried about him bingoing to the S and really sinking you.  I'm going into the bag.

#note This in a way really bailed me out.  Had to open this up.

#note I was really gunshy about making this play.  I have the last two Ts.  I don't want to open up another line with the blank unseen.  The only other option is VO(L)T for 8, which is just weak.  KO(R) blocks any advantage I have with those Ts.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEGKPRT 8A TRA.K +33 302
#note KEP(I)'s just begging for trouble.  So's this, but less so.
>Mark_Schmidt: DO 3H OD +13 258
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGGIPW A8 .EGG +6 308
#note Just allow me to be paranoid one turn.
>Mark_Schmidt: M C6 .M. +8 266
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILPRW 2F REP +12 320
#note G3 P(L)EW 21 is winning.  This accomplishes the same thing but for fewer points.  Then again, it doesn't close off bingos starting in T.  Champ doesn't find it, but it sims okay.
