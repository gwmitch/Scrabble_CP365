#note A bunch of bingoes missed here.  TOURISTY is definitely in my range and findable.  The other bingos are findable, too, but a lot harder.

#note AAah!  I saw MIDWIFED two turns later.  I'm bad -- I forgot my rule of ideating extensions for every word when played.  MIX, also, maybe better, but I wanted the pts, and a better chance at a ---IX word next turn.

#note Uggh.  I'm stupid and I challenge this.  Part of me was a little mad he blocked my BAILIE spot.  But I shouldn't be this dumb and challenge hiprob words of good players.
