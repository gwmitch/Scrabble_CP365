#note WEFT (26) or WOW (25) at 10l rank in the same range. Or maybe even better. Stupid automated know-it-all.

#note Maybe should've played PIU n12 (20). But I felt like I needed a fresh start. Bye bye, three Us.

#note Thought I was being cute with only 2 other Os unseen. Ducky likes it enough. Good boy.

#note Damn you, Zeigler. I mean, nice play.
>sneakyofverb: ACIORTU K4 CUI. +18 228
#note Totally missed RIO(J)A 1a (45) or even (H)ARICOT c2 (36). I suck.

>ziptreeglee: DEL H1 DEL. +24 291
#note For a second or 10, I thought this was a phony. Wise decision not challenging it. (And you over there, stop snickering. It was the first game and I'm not in the flow until at least the second half of Day 1.)
>sneakyofverb: EGORSTT H7 G..OTTERS +83 339
#note Or G(AR)ROTTES. Silly interchangable high-prob 8s with esses.

#note Ruh roh. I smell a frequent six-letter stem left over.
>sneakyofverb: AHOPSVY 13C HYP +32 371
#note Based on his last move, I was debating the validity of HA(R)PY 14f (29) and also considered VAPO(R)Y (20), but thought this was solid. And I felt if I block the two lines below and he bingos upstairs, I'm SOL if my rack turns golden.
>ziptreeglee: EEGINRS 1H .ESIGNER +86 381
>sneakyofverb: AIOSUVX F13 OX +37 408
#note (E)XUVIA 13h (48) is the highest-scoring entry, but I have to be wary about a possible bingo with five in the bag and the blank unseen. VA(R)IX 14f (39) might have worked out better.
>ziptreeglee: ?AEGIIT 15A GAIETy +30 411
#note He almost hit the clock when he had interchanged the I and E but worked out the correct alignment. (He did miss a bingo, but that wouldn't affect the outcome. Oops, I spoiled the ending.)
>sneakyofverb: AAIISUV 13K AVIA. +16 424
#note Sorry if you were in deep thought trying to come up with a brilliant out-in-two, since there isn't one. He was low on time, but there was no way he was gonna miss his outplay had I left it available.
