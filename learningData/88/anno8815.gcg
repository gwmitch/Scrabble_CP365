>E_Tran: EEHIKRS J10 HE +28 109
#note Screw defense; HIKE L12 is preferred here.  Or SHEIK.  I thought SIKER was a decent leave -- it's not that great.

>E_Tran: AEIKORS D1 KOAS +33 142
#note Not a good play.  Volatility here is unlikely to be rewarded, and that unhookable SO is bad news.  I like L1 KAISER better

#note missing REBIDDING/DEBRIDING.  i spent forever on this rack, only to settle for this, and see REBIDDING the turn later.
>Adam_Logan: EEHINRS 15A RESHINE. +98 324
#note uGH. And of course REBIDDING wouldn't allow him to bingo.
>E_Tran: ?ACEGIT C8 CIGArET. +72 253
#note I also take forever on this rack, and find the only bingo.
