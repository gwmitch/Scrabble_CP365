#note Yikes, not a whole lot I can do here. This doesn't do too badly in the sim, but TR(E)VET is more defensive with the same letters.

#note Ok I'm not sure what happened here, but whatever it was, I felt like an imbecile. It gets worse too.

#note So, both of my valid bingos stay open even though he could have blocked if he wanted to. I'm pretty sure anyone rated higher than 500 would be capable of finding and playing D(R)INKERS here. I really can't explain why I failed so bad. But I did and it makes me wonder how I managed to bumble into third place with horrendous misses like this.

#note Had no idea. I like WY(T)E more points better leave. (T)YE looks much better too. SWINNEY that's a new one.
>Eric_Tran: FIIOR 13J FI.RIO +22 329
#note VIBRIO is the correct word, but for all I knew this was a word too.

#note To infect with Syphilis. Lol ok.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAFOOTU 5K FOU +25 300
#note As terrible as this rack is, I basically gave him a free out bingo and I knew it. So taking the points doesn't do me any good. But I had no idea what to do, and I did NOT expect the blank to still be in the bag. 
>Eric_Tran: AEENRTT N3 TERNATE +66 431
#note Hm, entreat scores 75 here. There's no reason not to play it, he just played ternate instantly without thinking about it.
