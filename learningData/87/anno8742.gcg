>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADILOTV 8H AVOID +22 22
#note Against a tribe elder, you want to force the board open and make them sacrifice large amounts of equity to control the board.
>Tribe_Elder: AAILNYZ 7K LAZY +31 31
#note Other plays are too open for the tribe elder.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEEHLTX L4 HEX..E +34 56
#note Again, forcing the board open so that your opponent can waste equity closing the board.
>Tribe_Elder: AIKNOSV 10H KIVAS +38 69
#note Board blocking play.  Actually not a bad play at all.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACEEGLT J6 EG. +24 80
#note Baiting your paranoid opponent to spend equity to block the newly created S spot.
>Tribe_Elder: DEEFINO K2 FEOD +27 96
#note FEOD blocks the S-EGO hook, but it's much more important to score well by playing KNIFED. FEOD is an example of a tribe elder sacrificing too much equity to close the board.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACEELTT H10 .ETTLE +33 113
#note A nightmare for the tribe elder, as blocking this opening is going to prove to be tough.
>Tribe_Elder: ADEEIIN I13 AIN +11 107
#note Way too paranoid.  Tribe elders can't help themselves: even though blocking makes no sense, they do it anyway.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACFILRT 2I AF.LICT +46 159
#note Creating another opening that the tribe elder has to block.
>Tribe_Elder: DEEIJLR I1 J.ILED +18 125
#note More overzealous blocking by the tribe elder.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AENOORY O1 A.ONY +27 186
#note Best.
>Tribe_Elder: ?EIMRSW M5 WI. +31 156
#note WoRMIEST is just too dangerous for the tribe elder when he can play WIZ and hope for something next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEMNORT H3 MENO +20 206
#note Now that you're  ahead and the tribe elder likes blocking, you should oblige.  Before too long, the tribe elder will block himself out of the game.
>Tribe_Elder: ?CEMORS 14D COMp..ERS +70 226
#note Unless he draws a bingo.  SYCaMORE n6 is just too dangerous for the tribe elder.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EGRRSTU 11E URG. +10 216
#note Well, you have to open, even though you know it will get shut down.
>Tribe_Elder: BHNRSTU D8 BRUSH +32 258
#note More paranoia by the tribe elder.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEGRRST 8A GRA. +21 237
#note Using a fork, you've created two lanes for yourself.  Suddenly you have a good chance of winning again.
>Tribe_Elder: ?NOOPTW 9C T.OW +11 269
#note Trying to block as much as he can.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: BEIIRST G6 BI +12 249
#note Trying to hit column a or maybe row 12 or column f.
>Tribe_Elder: ?ANOPQT A4 QuAN.O +25 294
#note Paranoia gone over the top, as your opponent blocks at all cost.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EIPRSTU 13G U.. +6 255
#note While it's not looking good, fishing the U allows you to hit TRIPPETS 12h, YPERITES n7, and SPRINTER/STRIPIER at b1.  
>Tribe_Elder: AEOPRTU 12H .ROUT +14 308
#note The tribe elder still blocks, but already is afraid of a bingo elsewhere.  He feels like he doesn't have a choice, and blocks what seems to be the most dangerous lane without figuring out what his opponent could have.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EINPRST B1 SPRINTE. +92 347
#note Despite poor tiles, I have defeated the tribe elder!
>Kenji_Matsumoto:  (ADEEINP) +20 367
