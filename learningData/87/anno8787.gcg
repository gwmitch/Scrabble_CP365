#note Best.  8F placement sims 3 points down.

>Jim_Burlant: AEENTTV B6 NAVETTE +70 154
#note Luckbox!  This is best, and the only other bingo is ANTEVERT I2.  This wins 91%. This was looking good so far, but this was about to become a real shootout.
>Mike_Early: EGIOPSU I7 G.OUPIES +65 80
#note Surprising that Mike would miss this -  H8 EPIGEOUS scores 86.
>Jim_Burlant: DDIPQRT A12 DRIP +32 186
#note DIPT sims roughly 2 points better.  Nothing else worth considering past these two choices.
>Mike_Early: AABINZ A1 BANZAI +83 163
#note Terrific play by Mike - he's still only winning 25%.
>Jim_Burlant: DEJLQRT 12H J.LTED +44 230
#note Best play, winning 72%.  JILTER sims roughly 4 points down, and nothing else is worth consideration.
>Mike_Early: ACLOO 4A .OCALO +34 197
#note A huge play for Mike out of an obviously junk-addled rack.
>Jim_Burlant: BIIOOQR 5E ORIBI +20 250
#note No really good options here, so my intent was to simply turn as many tiles as I could and try again.  Q agrees - this or 5D BIRO is best.
>Mike_Early: ?ADILNU 4I LANgUID +70 267
#note Best bingo for Mike is ALIUNDe 4H 73.  This is runner-up, 2-1/2 points down.
>Jim_Burlant: AGIOQRX O1 QAI. +42 292
#note I thought this was a no-brainer play, but the sim says is a dead heat between this choice or OX B1.  I'm guessing that the sim expects that open U to still be there after Mike probably takes out the O column.  I was tired of looking at that Q for the last few racks and when I saw I could cash it for 42, that was as far as I looked.

#note Wasn't really sure what to do here.  My biggest concern was that he could hit something on row 1 that I might not be able to respond to.  I also wanted to leave row 10 and F8 alone so I could potentially bingo there, so that ruled out plays like GIN G7.  The sim results suggest this is a very strong defensive play and it sims as a 3-point runner up to 1A BONG.  I saw BONG and didn't think the play did much for me.  Truth be told, I like this a lot more than BONG as most humans aren't going to find extensions of BO on row 1 as easily as Quackle might.

#note Very dispiriting draw, to say the least.  My previous two games unraveled, and this one seemed to be slipping away too.   I wanted to turn tiles to go after the blank, even if I wouldn't be able to bingo with it.  Having said all that, this was an iffy choice.  I was so dead set on trying to bingo down the F column that I didn't look for plays that shut it down.  The one option that looks good that I didn't see was 9G FRO. The rest of Quackle's preferred plays - 13L FERN, 13L REFT, and 13L FER - are insane.

>Jim_Burlant: AEERRTU N6 UREA +11 375
#note Obviously a very risky play, but my feeling was that I needed somewhere else to score as I expected Mike to extend the W on the next turn.  I also thought cheap blocks on row 15 were a recipe for losing.  Champoinship Player says that 3J TUNA (which I didn't see) is best, but even if I had seen it I'm not sure I'd have put it down, as EERR seems to be so inflexible that I don't like my chances in an end game with it.  1A BOURTREE is cool, but you have to know it to play it.    At any rate, this play decided the game, as you'll see shortly.
>Mike_Early: ALMRY 15C .ARMLY +45 417
#note As expected...

#note Kapow!  The only bingo, and the only play that wins.
