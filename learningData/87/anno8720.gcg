>Matthew_Larocque: ILOQRST H7 QI +22 22
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEOOTUV G8 OUTDOVE +68 68
#note No good. Should have challenged here, I'm positive I've even tried OUTDIVE myself before! Despite all the phony plays against me this tournament, none of them actually caused me to lose any games (miraculously).
>Matthew_Larocque: CLORSTX H11 OX +37 59
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIRU 7H .UIRE +15 83
>Matthew_Larocque: CGLRSTU M3 CULTS +32 91
#note I was going back and forth between TRUG 8L and this. I don't care about keeping cees, and in this case it nets me 2 extra points over TRUGS or GLUTS.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AFHW K4 WHA.F +28 111
#note Even though I don't have his full rack, surely HAF(T) for 38 is better?
>Matthew_Larocque: DGGORRT 14C GORG.D +13 104
#note Yuck. I missed GROG/TROG/GROT forming OXO. This play ended up creating a very lucky sequence that helped me massively, though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EILOU 10E OU.LIE +20 131
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRTT 15H ENTREAT +83 187
#note I don't care how dangerous this is, 83 points has to be a no-brainer. I mean, this board isn't rife with bingo lines, and I'm trailing, so I'm just going to have to hope I get lucky and he can't capitalize. This play sims way the heck better than anything else.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EINWZ 11A WIZEN +38 169
#note *sigh of relief*
>Matthew_Larocque: ADMNPSV O11 VAMPS +63 250
#note The plot thickens
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AILT 12G ..TAIL +26 195
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEINS C9 DA.IN. +38 288
#note Yikes, A carnivorous fish with a name I can't pronounce plays through the I. This ranks pretty good, but sim prefers the lower scoring TWS plays using the W.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AADIMOR B3 DIORAMA +65 260
>Matthew_Larocque: ACENRSY D3 CARNEYS +86 374
#note Even though I recognized this, I wasn't 100%, and losing my turn could be a disaster. My alternate options were the pair of Triple Word Scores. I almost played *(W)YCES! Yikes. YAR A7 was the third play I considered.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BGIL -  +0 260
#note Challenge; the green check mark saved my ass from blowing this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABHNRY A7 YA +32 406
#note Not playing YAR was stupid - my intent was to save it to play H(A)R(T) next turn - but HANT is just as valid so this was kind of terrible. Oh, and I missed HYeNA for 71, holy frig. Sim likes keeping Y, screw that the Y is garbage get off my rack.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BGIL A1 GLIB +40 300
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEEHNR 6J H.R. +30 436
#note Totally whiffed on the new plays available down in the corner. This sims kind of bad, and H(A)N(T) is a slightly better choice. Ths winner of the simulation is dumping the B for 20 in the same spot. Ok, why? G bingos?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: KOS 9I KOS +40 340
#note yipes
>Matthew_Larocque: ??BEENT K11 B. +8 444
#note Holy crap. So there's 2 in the bag, lets dump the clunky B and hope Juraj doesn't block the G!
>Juraj_Pivovarov: FOP F6 FOP +21 361
>Matthew_Larocque: ??EEENT 1A .ENEraTE +74 518
#note Juraj says he didn't block, thought I had 4 Es. There are 3 other bingoes here besides this. With 2 blanks,  I thought there would be a lot more. Fluky game all around, this is my first victory over Juraj in like 8 games or something - getting 500+ didn't even cross my mind.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EEIJN) +24 542
#note - 10 for time, I ate up like half my clock on CARNEYS.
