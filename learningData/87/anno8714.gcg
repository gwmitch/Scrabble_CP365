#note Sims best by a considerable margin. There are other ways to score similarly with the Z (ZERO, DAZE, DOZE, RAZE, etc), but this is the best one defensively.

#note I struggled a lot with this one. Most of the things I saw offered way too much counterplay for my liking (like Quackle's choice of HALO B12 is cool because it sets up HAM, but that isn't likely to work). I chose this because it scored and didn't give anything crazy back. I might have chosen HAEMAL 12H instead, had I seen it.

#note Both the many-ply sim and CP say to wait on the X, and drop the Q at 9C first. I understand there are multiple X spots (like L10), but I need points here and 37 is a lot. Can't the Q wait? It's not like he's gonna block that spot next turn. The Q could still be in the bag for all he knows.

>Evans_Clinchy: AHIQRUW 15D WHA +31 419
#note Oops, missed the better WHA spot at O1. So low on time, I was happy just to grasp the general principle here -- score with WHA now, cash in one of the two QI spots next.
