#note Sims best. Unloads a bunch of consonants without opening any counterplay. BRST has nice synergy. RIB M4 is kinda cute since it sets up the Y, but I can't mess around with tricks like that here.
>Ian_Weinstein: GINY D8 .YING +20 149
>Evans_Clinchy: BDRRSTU 11A BUR.T +14 165
#note For some reason I thought this was a more open play than the same word at 6B. That's poppycock. Quackle sets me straight as usual.

>Evans_Clinchy: BDEERSU 15D BURSEED +104 269
#note Well, that sure does suck. SUBBREED. :-(
>Ian_Weinstein: ?CIJORX B10 J.ICeR +60 280
>Evans_Clinchy: ANORRTU 1F ORA +18 287
#note This sims pretty poorly compared to other plays in the same spot like TRONA, but that doesn't tell the whole story, does it? I need to win by 58 to win the tournament. I need a bingo. NRTU is a pretty solid leave with AAAAAEEIIIOOOOO unseen. Lots of ways for this rack to turn into a bingo real quick. The sim says ORA is about 22 percent to bingo next turn, which is a pretty decent shot, all things considered. Thought this was worth a try.
>Ian_Weinstein: OX 2E OX +50 330
#note Another reason for ORA was the X. I figured I needed all the volatility I could get, and an X spot might help me if I get lucky and draw it. But oops, it turns out he's already got it.
>Evans_Clinchy: INRSTTU 12G .NTIRUST +68 355
#note This does in fact take an S. I'm hoping Ian might not know this.
>Ian_Weinstein: OW F8 .OW +34 364
>Evans_Clinchy: ADELOSV N7 SOLVA.ED +90 445
#note "Guess I might as well hold. Nothing at stake, just two grand." Ian proceeds to hold for eleven minutes. Correctly lets it go, eventually.
>Ian_Weinstein: AGIILOT D1 AGIO +33 397
#note This is Ian's actual rack, and Quackle definitely thinks he played it right. He was beating himself up after the game over not playing GLOAT for five points more, but that strikes me as the wrong play. Keeping two I's makes it too easy for me to restrict his options in the endgame. Looks like Ian made the right play, but it didn't work out.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEFMOQ 14I FOAME. +24 469
#note Best, threatening two spots to go out with QAT.
>Ian_Weinstein: AILLT C3 ALL +16 413

#note ...and then I resumed breathing.
