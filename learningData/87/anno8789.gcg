>Jim_Burlant: CDMNOOR 8D CONDOM +28 28
#note  Q prefers the 8G placement by roughly 1 point.
>Darrell_Day: AITW 7E WAIT +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: DJOORSY 9H OY +23 51
#note Urp -  Brain lock set in after he blocked my intended play of JOY 7H.  The presence of yet another Y blinded me to the obvious play of  DOJOS J4.
>Darrell_Day: IP 9E PI +15 36
>Jim_Burlant: DJMORSS 10B MODS +22 73
#note I don't like any of Q's top choces (COSS 6B , 10B JOSS), as I don't think 36 points is enough to justify burning both my S's.  This is the best simming play among those that keeps an S.
>Darrell_Day: AV D6 VA. +16 52
>Jim_Burlant: ?BIJRST C9 J.B +20 93
#note I normally would play JOIST, but with Darrell fishing and possibly not sitting on an S, I figured I'd play it conservatively.  I have S?, and if he doesn't have a C or an S, what can he do on this board?    Despite the points given up on the scoreboard to JOIST, Championship Player indicates this play is every bit as strong as JOIST; CP says this play only gives up 1.3 points to JOIST.  And I reap big dividends as you'll see in a second.
>Darrell_Day: AK 6F KA +38 90
#note Play misscored as 37.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIIRST 12A mISTIER +75 168
#note Upside down board dyslexia strikes again.  Thought I saw KAIN, then turned the board around  he'd already drawn tiles and I saw what he had played.  Whoops.  Best bingo is 12C SILTIER, but this choice sims within 1 point of that.  Not sure why I chose this instead of that.
>Darrell_Day: EO D10 .O.E +9 99
>Jim_Burlant: ?INNTTU G10 TU.N +5 173
#note No bingos play here.  Took a while to find this, but this is best.
>Darrell_Day: AEILRST J2 TAILERS +73 172
>Jim_Burlant: ?IINNTZ 4I Z.TI +26 199
#note 3 Plays stand out:  this choice, K4 TIN, or K4 NIT.  This ultimately percolates to the top of the heap.
>Darrell_Day: AEW H13 AWE +20 192
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGGINN M1 GINsENG +83 282
#note As I reached for the blank slip, Darrell's words:  "Eat me!"  My reply:  "Hey Darrell, 1978 called.  They want their insults back!"   Commentary notwithstanding...this is best.  Other options include GENTLING on row 2 and ENGINING L1 with numerous placements of the blank.
>Darrell_Day: FHIT 1K FI.HT +39 231
>Jim_Burlant: DEERUVY 14A EVERY +28 310
#note Best.  I was less concerned about building a rack than I was about emptying the bag as quickly as possible.  I wasn't too worried about dumping my E's, as a look at the pool showed there were still 5 unseen.  Q agrees, saying that either this or VEERY are my best plays.  
>Darrell_Day: EF 2L F.E +27 258
>Jim_Burlant: ADGNRUX K4 .AX +33 343
#note Q prefers A14 EX by 4 points.  I also gave serious consideration to WAX 14H with the intent of taking away row 15 bingos...but I thought it could let him play for too many points on row 15.  Ultimately I opted to max out my score and turn the extra tile.
>Darrell_Day: BEIOORU -BEIOO +0 258
>Jim_Burlant: BDGNORU I13 BOD +25 368
#note Any number of good choices here - with him having exchanged his previous turn, I figured that now was the time to shut down bingos on rows 14 and 15 and push my lead to over 100 while doing it.  Q agrees - this is best.  As I put this down, I was feeling very confident about the outcome of this game - he was now two bingos down and rapidly running out of time.
>Darrell_Day: LU 6B LU. +8 266
>Jim_Burlant: AGNQRSU 2F QUAR. +34 402
#note A conflicted sim.  8M SUQ has the highest valuation, but I see no reason to put the Q at O8 - not with a U still at large.  Ultimately, this play percolates to the top of the heap.  Normally I'd want to keep the R and not the N, but with the G in my rack the N is the better keep.  Also, note the pool  - 2 R's remaining and only 1 N.
>Darrell_Day: EH 1H HE +32 298
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLNSU J10 GLUE +15 417
#note Q wants me to burn the S, but this was otherwise the right idea since the bingo doesn't play.  No matter how I slice it, everything wins > 99.5% by now.
>Darrell_Day: O 6J ..O. +11 309
>Jim_Burlant: DENNRRS 12J .RN +6 423
#note Ohne of 5 plays that wins 100%.  I wanted to leave one in the bag, and after spending several minutes, I couldn't find an 8 through it with any of the remaining pool.
>Darrell_Day: CILP 3D CLIP +29 338
>Jim_Burlant: DENORS B1 RONDE.S +16 439
#note Best is N6 SORNED 28.
