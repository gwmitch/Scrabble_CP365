#note Q docks me 10 pts for this - presumably becuase of the consonant overload in the leave.  Maybe Q is right - one has to wonder what would have happened had I turned one more tile here.

#note While my last play certainly left room for debate, this one doesn't.  Nothing else is even worth considering.

>Jim_Burlant: ILNORYZ 9E IRONY +31 85
#note A mild equity slip but a crucial error.  This was the right idea, but LINY would have scored 30 and not given him the 2x2 line to work with.  Don't know why I didn't see LINY.
>Darrell_Day: ?DEESTW E5 WeED.EST +94 99
#note Or WEDgIEST.
>Jim_Burlant: GHLOTUZ F5 OH +30 115
#note Cool front hook that didn't occur to me:  the front T on WEEDIEST, which would have allowed me to play OUGHT 4A for 32 or better yet, LUTZ 4C.  This scores well but is very weak.
>Darrell_Day: DEHI 8A HIDE. +33 132
>Jim_Burlant: EGLOTUZ B6 GL.TZ +39 154
#note Again, not recognizing the WEEDIEST front hook killed me.  4A GLOUT or 4E TOUZLE are the plays.  This scores well but the leave is decidedly bad.

#note Hey, I had to get at least one play right this game, right? Either this or OUTLIVE 12C.

>Jim_Burlant: AAEEFIR 2J FA.IA +36 218
#note The critical position.  It's been a while since I went through the 4-vowel 6's and this turn drove me crazy.  Had I seen FACIAE?  Or was I making it up?  After several minutes, I convinced myself it didn't take the back E, and this reduced my 28% winning chances to zero.  
>Darrell_Day: BEOO 1G OBOE +23 256
>Jim_Burlant: EEENRRV 11G EVENER +20 238
#note Wow, I missed a bingo.  Had no idea REVENUER was a word, and it didn't even occur to me to look for a bingo. Not knowing that, NERVE O1 would have been my play had I not convinced myself that FACIA didn't take the back E. This is lame.
>Darrell_Day: AACEIOR O1 CERIA +35 291
>Jim_Burlant: EIRRSTX -  +0 238
#note Double jeopardy.  Not only did I miss 27 points by not playing NERVE O1, now I've given Darrell a free turn by challenging this. While I've been my own biggest enemy to this point, my tiles now collapse and what was still a possibly winnable game deteriorates into oblivion.
