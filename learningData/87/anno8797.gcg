>E_Tran: AEEILOP 5J OPE +29 139
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AEORTTU B7 TA.OURET +74 168
#note Considered OBTURATE, which would set up 2 really really juicy lanes.  I opt to set up a great lane, and a soso lane.  Sim is close, but favours tabouret.

>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AAAIIOT 15C TAO +9 367
#note That last play was really scary.  But my rack is crap.  My thinking was to block and make him score 60 while I can get a 30ish pt counter.  But, really, this rack sucks and I need to exchange.
>E_Tran: ?AEJNSV C1 J.VA +28 333
#note Dammit! He wasn't going to bingo!
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AAIINRU 1H .AUNA +8 375
#note I hummed and hawed over these last two turns for 10 minutes.  I considered exchanging, ANURIA, or this.  But then I got really low on time.  Ugggh.  I really needed to conserve more time for the endend game: the overthinking on these crappy racks costed me.
>E_Tran: ?DEELNS 10I SLENDEr +71 404
>E_Tran: ?DEELNS --  -71 333
#note I also took a minute before exchanging this off.  More wasted time.  At this pt, I have 1 minute left.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EFIIORS 1C .O +13 388
#note Wise wins 100% of the time.  I think forever before fishing off O.  Too low on time, I didn't even spot WISE.

>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EEFIIRS H11 FRI.E +27 415
#note Assuming I wasn't already 2 minutes over on time, UNIFIERS would have won it for me.

#note -30 for player two (TRAN) for time
