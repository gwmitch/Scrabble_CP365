>Evans_Clinchy: EEHNPVY 8E HYPE +24 24
#note ENVY, especially with the V on the star, is way better defensively than HYPE. Shoulda realized that.

#note BUM 7F looks like an improvement over this.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?ELNORT 1C .TONER +21 329
#note Didn't even bother looking for 59-point bingos like PETRONEL/REDOLENT in line 7. No point in wasting the blank and giving him easy counterplays. I think ATONER is definitely right. Quackle is being funky and suggesting things that leave that line open, like POL 4D or ONE F10. With a lead, that seems kinda silly.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?IILLMT K4 .LIM +14 343
#note Sims best. Again, didn't really look for bingos. MELILITE is the only one, which I probably would have missed anyway.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?HLRTTU L6 TURTLe +12 381
#note I think this is actually best! I've gotta block lines L and 11, and this knocks out both. It still loses if the T is in the bag and he hits LEADING/TURTLED, but I'm pretty sure there are zero guaranteed wins in this position and a 7/8 shot is the best I can do. I've permuted every candidate move I can think of, and this is the best I've found.
