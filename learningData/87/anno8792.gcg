#note This is such a Juraj Phoney
>E_Tran: CHIIIOQ 6F QI +33 55
#note ICH is better to cover both COZEN spots.  I spotted it after I hit the clock.  Too hasty on cashing in my Q.

>E_Tran: ABKRSVY 4L B.VY +32 154
#note Missing VARY L1 for 10 mor pts.  This was one of those tunnel vision slapdown plays.  I make them very infrequenly, and this is why.

>E_Tran: AEKNRRS F9 RERANKS +82 236
#note RANKERS is the real bingo, but I got greedy for pts.  I seriously thought this and PRERANKS were good.  odd.

#note Trying to stifle the board, and set up a nice smallish play next turn at J.  If he takes it, he'll have to blow an E.  no reason to open the board with DETENT or anything like that.

#note And I can't even block that spot.  With 7 in the bag, I thought it might be a good idea to let him bingo into junk.  Champ likes exchanging 7!!  I wanted the WA to score at B10, which is 2nd
