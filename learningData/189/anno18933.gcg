>the_james_stews: CCIRTUW -CCIUW +0 0
#note JM: The duck prefers keeping one of the Cs (either CRIT or CRT) rather than chucking them both like I did. I'm always paranoid that I'll draw all consonants in these scenarios, so I toss an extra consonant when in doubt in cases like this.
>sneakyofverb: EILNNOR 8C ONLINER +66 66
#note EB: i wasn't 10000% sure this was good. but hey, i'm playing matthews. so he'll probably let it go.
>the_james_stews: ADEJRRT 7A RAJ +35 35
#note JM: C7 J(O)R# is more defensive and keeps a better leave, but is 16 points less. I opted for more points, volatility and a decent leave. I'm probably giving up too much more often than not, though.
>sneakyofverb: AEEGMRT H1 METERAG. +86 152
#note EB: two for two. sweet. what could possibly go wrong now?
>the_james_stews: DEGRSTU A1 TRUDGE.S +158 193
>the_james_stews: DEIOSUV (challenge) +5 198
#note JM: How luckboxy* of me. Grabbed the nickel too...EB: not cool, buddy. not cool.
>sneakyofverb: HILNOVW 5E WHO.L +22 174
>the_james_stews: DEIOSUV 3C DEVOU. +22 220
#note EB: showoff.
>sneakyofverb: EIINNTV 6G N.IVE +20 194
#note EB: thought i could be missing something better but quackle likes my choice. IT REALLY LIKES ME!
>the_james_stews: CFIMOSW 5K WOF +28 248
#note JM: MOC tops the list here, but I'm not sure I like the FISW over WOF's leave, even for 11 points. Would rather not require at least one turn after this to declutter my rack, which I will with FW and only an I for a vowel on my rack.
>sneakyofverb: AEINNPT 4L PIAN +27 221
#note EB: 4j NAPE is 4 more and is less volatile. but i figured i might as well let him have a shot at a second 9-timer.
>the_james_stews: CIIMRSS N1 MIC.S +28 276
#note JM: M1 MIR(IF)IC# is a cool list-topping play - didn't know it! Mine is second.
>sneakyofverb: EEINRTY E8 .IENTERY +72 293
#note EB: studying those high prob bingos for the 10 billionth time is finally starting to pay off. c'mon, jesse, here's your third chance to embarrass the crap out of me.
>the_james_stews: AFIORST O1 OF +32 308
#note JM: These racks always make me feel like an awful Scrabble player. I was pretty sure there were no bingos but still took a long tme to work through the rack, using up valuable time I badly needed later.
>sneakyofverb: ??AIKNO 15A pINK. +48 341
#note EB: i immediately saw KArYOtIN but debated its validity. so scoring 48 while keeping one blank would be the next best option. saw KAYOINgs# but thought i was making it up (pYINKAdO# and YAKImoNO# also would play. sorry, haven't gotten that far down the CSW-only bingo lists.)
>the_james_stews: AIORSTX 4C OX +39 347
>sneakyofverb: ?AAEIOO E2 A.O. +20 361
#note EB: A(N)OA d7 (19) sheds an extra vowel, making me look like an idiot.
>the_james_stews: AIIPRST D10 PAIR +24 371
#note JM: I at least want to make him work a bit for the bingo that is likely coming, given his last play. There's a decent chance he won't have 8s from the N or R, potentially playing a bingo starting in S that might take an S at the end (which I have). EB: way to block ABOITEAU, killjoy.
>sneakyofverb: ?ABEIOU 14A OBA +21 382
#note EB: i can never remember BOUN#. sigh.
>the_james_stews: DDGILST 2D D.G +27 398
>sneakyofverb: ?ABEITU C12 BE.. +23 405
#note EB: (AN)TIABUsE? sure thing, quacky. it's not like i've studied most of the 9s.
>the_james_stews: ADILSTU F7 D.TA +16 414
#note JM: My play looks odd here without context. Evan overdrew and I turned over QTZ. I gave him QT and threw the Z back in the bag, because I saw no place for QI on the board. I decided to try to force him to use his blank to play off his Q, just in case he didn't have the other U. If he had the U, he'd need to spend another turn trying to get rid of it and avoid getting stuck...EB: now that i see the 9LW, you block it. i hate playing canadians.
>sneakyofverb: ?AIQTTU A12 QU.. +22 427
#note EB: right after i hit the clock, i noticed the new U insertion i created. so why didn't i just play QU(BIT)?! hint: because sometimes, i suck. (QUI(PO) l1 also scores 26.)
>the_james_stews: EEILSUY B10 LEU +21 435
#note JM: At this point I'm very low on time. 1H (M)ULEY looks like a much better play, which I did not see. I just looked for points that didn't open the board up more and took them.
>sneakyofverb: ?AEITTZ C7 ..T +11 438
#note EB: like my opponent, i was also running low on time (thanks to the double-blank debacle). don't want to empty the bag while still myself the illusion of bingoing out or scoring well with the Z. this one-tile 'fish' tops the list.
>the_james_stews: CEILSSY J6 .IS +14 449
#note JM: Again low on time. I've got the right idea here, but J8 SLY scores more points, gets rid of the troublesome Y and doesn't offer much in the way of bingos in response. It also removes the R as a lane for 8s. 3% lower winning percentage on this play, but having the Y on my rack makes it much worse in reality.
>sneakyofverb: ?AAEITZ 3K ZA +16 454
#note EB: el duck is suggesting a number of words across row 9 that will score 30 and use the blank. but i'm too flustered to even consider any of them and can only take solace in shedding the Z while retaining the 0-pointer.
>the_james_stews: CEHLSY G10 LECH +19 468
#note JM: This is one of the only games of the tournament where I knew 100% after the game that I'd blown it. I saw LYCHES. I thought it wasn't a word. I saw that it was literally the only way I could win in this position. With more time perhaps I would've talked myself into playing it. Terrible, terrible way to lose a game that I felt I'd otherwise played relatively well...EB: and i'm a bigger moron for missing your out play.
>sneakyofverb: ?AEIT 12G .EnTAI +16 470
#note EB: so i'm basically panicking now. lay out the letters from the C but can't immediately find anything...damn, now over time...i've blown this one...oh, wait, even with the time penalty, i'm still good...exhale.
>sneakyofverb:  (SY) +10 480
#note minus 10 for the time penalty makes the real score 470-468. scrabble is so boring.
