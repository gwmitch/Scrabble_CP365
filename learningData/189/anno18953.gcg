#note Quackle is dumb. I'm not fishing here, 34 leaving the blank has to be right especially with the S wide open. Given the amount of A's left he's likely to make a play at 15A with only 3 letters, because he would need the H to hit the 15D spot really hard. (A)L(S) for 9 is what Quackle likes best but the only play ahead of mine that I like also is TAL(C) for 20. I might have played that if I saw it. (-5)

#note Drawing 3 O's ruins the purpose of my last move! I should have just played TAL(C) but i need to look harder next time.

#note I'm not playing (J)IAO for 22 to open that spot leaving OOV?. Even with the blank next turn sucks.

>Joey_Krafchick: AADEILT I1 AL.E +15 344
#note With 4 unseen E's I'm ok leaving ADIT. I prioritized blocking this spot because with a blank out a bingo is the only way I lose, and considering the GPKQ out I shouldn't worry about a brutal 50 point play at 8A, so at this point I just take the points and hope he doesn't bingo to the R in RAH. AL(O)E is 5 points back on a 2 plie sim but I stand by it.

>Joey_Krafchick: ABDIPRT 13M B.P +22 366
#note I looked hard for plays this turn and missed TRIP(O)D at 8A. That's the best play by FAR and mine is in second and I feel like an idiot.
>Joe_Geibler: ?EEKRTT 2F KE.. +21 367
>Joey_Krafchick: ADEEIRT 14L RA.E +14 380
#note I thought about this play for a REALLY long time. With this play I looked at it like this:

Unless the Q is in the bag, he has it. His best play with the Q is likely 27 points at N9 but that's his only one. If he had the blank and no I it would be 23, not 27, AND burning the blank. That being said, EFRT? as a leave probably wins it, so if I draw a T or Q I could be in trouble, but as long as I go out first I'm find. I wrote out each scenario and went over each complete sequence to make sure I wasn't crazy for playing RA(G)E, but it worked. 

I forgot to mention that the downhill potential path of losing is if I draw the Q. I should be able to go out first.
