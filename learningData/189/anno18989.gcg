#note OUTGO may be a little better. Didn't think the leave/positioning was 2 points better but it looks like it is just barely.

>Marj_Hinderbleedy: MU H14 MU +22 158
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ANNRTUY 12G .YNURA +24 102
#note Took a long time to see this. Nearly settled for F13 AY which sims about even but looks a little gross for my comeback prospects.
>Marj_Hinderbleedy: DEZ M11 ZED +35 193
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEHNRTX 9F N.XT +23 125
#note I don't have an S, but I should not be killing the last S line. Admittedly I was hoping to bait NEXTS#, which is unlikely but still worth something against a CSW player. 13B OXEN is definitely an improvement
>Marj_Hinderbleedy: ELOSU 14J LOUSE +28 221
#note He played this quickly and had me doubting whether it took hooks. I was pretty sure LOUSING was a bingo. But maybe it's SOULING and LOUSE takes no hooks? Hmm
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEHINRW F6 WH.. +18 143
#note NEXT blocked my bingo :( And WHIN is really bad :(. Whiffed on the clearly best play C13 WIT. Not playing well!
>Marj_Hinderbleedy: ?AGILRS 7H GLAIReS +69 290
#note Looks like he's sure LOUSE doesnt take an S

#note Fail. I didn't realise I was still giving up MANTELET, which is as likely as MALEATE/MANATEE combined. Something like 5I BALE blocks that as well as the big ANIMATER nonbingo threat. Though that's technically a nonfactor since MATZAH would come down in that case. Basically I'm boned.
