#note Didn't like FOUGHT. But OUTWIT is just a miss. Also TWIG sims better than this, which I am not too surprised by. I think I like OUTWIT for some openness here. Sims even with this, both a point behind TWIG

#note Key point in the game! The lack of an OUTWITS hook hurts now, and I'm off on a fishing expedition. O1 OR may be better, but it's very close.

#note Key point in the game! The lack of an OUTWITS hook is killing me now, and I'm off on a fishing expedition. I failed to consider how perfectly fine it is to just keep scoring and force Wayne to keep up or open the board. N5 IKAT is just fine and this is a 3-4 point error. Seems small, but this snowballs into an avalanche of sadness

#note Now I'm just playing badly. Scoring is still a perfectly good option. Play ABRI and stop feeling entitled to an E draw on 2-tile fishes.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIIRRST 15J RI. +4 195
#note Staying the course, I guess. TRIAD/RITARD are fine, too. Probably better.

#note Maybe tilting a little. This is awful. 6G ID is just what I need but I whiffed on it. Running low on time and patience.

#note This is a game to learn from! Tunnelling on the RSTAI leave with buckets of E's unseen clearly cost me my chance. The LOOK, RUB, RID sequence was bad. I was obviously committed by the time DINO came around, but failed to see the obvious ID play to make a comeback possible. All-in-all, I give myself a 8 out of 10 for this game. On the shittiness scale.
