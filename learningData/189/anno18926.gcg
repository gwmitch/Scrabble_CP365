#note The most frustrating moment of the tournament. Joel plays this, and I immediately hold. I think for a few seconds, pretty sure it's no good, and then mumble under my breath "wow I can't believe I am so bad at spelling." Joel the draws his tiles, so I assume he's courtesy drawing, and put my head down to think. Four minutes later, still so totally confused that Joel might misspell this word, I look up and Joel has mixed his tiles. But I haven't released him from the hold! Unfortunately, he misheard me as saying "I accept", so we called the director over. We explained the situation, and the director said his instinct is to say I accepted the play because I didn't say anything when Joel drew tiles. Feeling that was a crap ruling, I asked for a second opinion, and the director left. At this point I was so flustered and annoyed and felt like I was about to be seriously wronged (and STILL pretty sure the word was spelled wrong), I walked over and said I would just let the play stand. I really think there's an issue in the rules here, and I am very upset that I was going to be punished for something that was not my fault. Spoiler alert: I end up bagging Joel, so there was no issue.

#note I'm now so nervous/anxious that I almost chicken out of (R)AVISHER, and completely whiff on a high probability bingo for 26 more. Seriously frustrated.
