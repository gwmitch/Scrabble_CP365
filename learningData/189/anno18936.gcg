#note it is pretty bad that i can't tell that the 9I FOLLY placement is more defensive than 7I. honestly i still don't see it. (-2)
>cardia: ?AAIRRV 9G ARRIVAl +82 106
#note because of that?
>cesar: BGHHRRU M3 HURR. +22 50
#note 10D BURG despite keeping two Hs - it is essential that I try to open the board as much as possible now :( i also mistakenly thought that HURRY took a D. (-6.5)
>cardia: AY 6J YA +28 134
>cesar: ABEGHNR 10C BHANG +26 76
#note BEGAN 10E - missing a lot of stuff here because i'm seriously freaking out about the board. there's also GAEN 10G, etc -- just not spotting those because i'm terrified of a closed board.. N2 BAH is pretty interesting though but i didn't want to block DHURRY* (-6)

#note eek
>cesar: ?BCDORS 11G SCROD +30 147
#note i was extremely close to trying SCOBRID* here but the longer i waited the higher the odds i thought of it being challenged off. quackle doesn't like me burning the S and thinks I should play for the bingo with K1 BOD. i was just worried about scoring. (-3)

#note the board got blocked anyway but this gets me close.

>cesar: ?MNNQST -MNNQ +0 209
#note maybe better off keeping MS? for scoring? (-3.5) ST? not doing anything at all on this board.
>cardia: DIIOST 15J IDIOTS +26 269
>cesar: ?EJPSTT M11 PETT. +14 223
#note at this point the only chance i thought i had of winning was hoping to draw the O for JUNCO/JO and start making weird, non board opening plays like this... quackle likes 12J PET by 2.5 eq for some reason, i think it's just going to be wrong on this horrible board..
>cardia: AE 14L A.E +12 281
>cesar: ?EJLNNS 12J NEN. +13 236
#note i don't know how obvious this is, but please give me an O... he's gotta suspect something is fishy. 12C NIL is super interesting because it makes JO tougher to block, unless he has an S.
>cardia: P 5K P.. +20 301
>cesar: ?AJLQSX 13G X. +34 270
#note quackle thinks I should burn the blank here with Jo. I decided to take my chances that he wouldn't see it and try one more time for the O, but that is really really foolhardy. it's my only shot to win and now that I have the X to score my winning chances are actually pretty damn good. How often is one's win% a whopping 93.25% on a closed board when down 65? (well, 11 after Jo but still).  (-4.5)
>cardia: AM N10 MA +14 315
>cesar: ?AEJLQS F14 Jo +54 324
#note I think quackle is wrong about QATS winning 100% of the time. he could always see JUNCO and block with a T or something and then i'll have a tough endgame.
