#note This wins the sim by 1.5 to my surprise...Quackle agrees but I think MOO J9 is a fine play too.

#note L12 OHI(A) is a GREAT equity play and I missed it. A 2 plie sim put my play head to head with OHIA but the reality is, with CENTU not taking an S and now the board is very shut, the H felt really valuable, so that's sort of my stylistic choice. I have a thing for H's. 900 iterations and they are less than 0.3 apart.

#note Championship player and I disagree here. With 5 vowels and 5 consonants out (and a blank) I have a pretty good chance of drawing AT LEAST one vowel, and with GLMZ I can outrun him as long as he doesn't bingo. That being said, I saved the 6 point to keep the M and not the L because I could foresee a REALLY bad situation for me since there is nowhere to play something like "LEZ" or "ZING" if I don't get an I or a blank. With the M I can score well and get rid of the Z on my next two turns and I'll have him outscored most likely. Interesting play here to me.

#note As I imagined, I drew at least one vowel. I was lucky and got 2! Championship player has this as the only winning play.
