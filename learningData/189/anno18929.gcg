>Matt_Canik: CDDILNU H8 UNDID +18 18
#note Matt: LUDIC is a word I didn't know. 
>Charles_Reinke: ABIJNRU 11E JAR.BU +30 30
#note Matt: I held this for a while. I know Charles knows a lot of words but I was pretty sure it was JABIRU, not JARIBU*. I couldn't get a tell from him. I wish I had balls... if I hadn't had the horrible word knowledge lapses I had had earlier in the tournament I think this would come off the board. Confidence, man. 

Charles: I didn't think hard enough before putting this down.
>Matt_Canik: ACFLRUZ J10 C.RF +15 33
#note Matt: Since I'm unsure of this word, I really want to eliminate the S hook. I need to stop getting scared of hooks I don't know... first PITTA and now this. This was fishing for an E for ZED while blocking. Q still hates it, but it knows the hooks to JARIBU****
>Charles_Reinke: EGIMNUV 13J .UMING +24 54
#note Charles: The most potent scoring area of the board is around F10 or D12.  I should play M(A)UVE.
>Matt_Canik: AEELNUZ 10F ZE. +66 99
#note Matt: boom
>Charles_Reinke: AAEKMQV 8G Q.A +12 66
#note Charles: Q(U)AKE give up too much.  Quackle is cool with holding on to the Q for now and playing 12L MAE, but I hate keeping the Q when I have a chance to play it.
>Matt_Canik: AELNTUY O12 U.LY +27 126
>Charles_Reinke: AAEKMVX 12L AX +35 101
>Matt_Canik: AENRTTW 15J TWENT. +13 139
#note Matt: I know the Reinkes LOVE to bingo from their annotated games. I feel like a really shut down board is something I really want right now. So I played this. TAWNE(Y) does the same thing but holds better and scores more. 

Charles: I can't deny it.  I love bingos.
>Charles_Reinke: AAEKMTV F7 MAT.. +29 130
#note Charles: 7I KAVA, which was also available the past two turns.
>Matt_Canik: AAEIRSS 12F SA. +24 163
#note Matt: Glad I didn't play SADER*
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEEKOV E3 EVOKE +28 158
#note Charles: I had to do something to open up the board because I feel like I play better in those situations.  AQUA(E) plays did the opposite of that.
>Matt_Canik: AEEEIRS 4D E.E +12 175
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEGHIS J2 GEIsHAS +86 244
>Matt_Canik: ADEIORS 2B ADORE +29 204
#note Matt: He blocks both ROADIES spots with his own bingo :( :( :(

Charles: Overscored by two, cheater.
>Charles_Reinke: DEIINNO C2 .INO +17 261
>Matt_Canik: CEFIRSY 1F FYCE +41 245
>Charles_Reinke: BDEHILN 3I B.HIND +30 291
#note Charles: With two S's and a blank out, setting up the big BEHIND(S) hook might not be smart.  I should play it safe with K5 HIN.
>Matt_Canik: ILLPRRS O3 SPRILL +46 291
#note Matt: I pretty much need to play SPRILL* (I think there's about a 70% chance it's phoney) to win this game. 

Charles: I had never seen it before, and at the time SPRILLS would have been within my range, but I thought I could pull out the win without challenging.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AELOOW 8L WOO. +11 302
#note Charles: The bag doesn't look bingo-friendly for Matt, so I think that B5 has a good chance of staying open.  Even if it doesn't, anything Matt plays there will create new lanes.  The downside of this play is that it blocks bingo lanes in columns L and M.  However, with three O's in the bag, it seems imperative to dump both O's, and I also really want to rid myself of the W.
>Matt_Canik: AEINRRT B5 TERRAIN +63 354
#note Matt: My courtesy tiles while I was on hold were AEINRT. What a luckbox. 

Charles: Darn!
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEELOV A10 LOVAgE +40 342
#note Charles: Throwing in the towel.  Quackle wants me to fish, but there is no way that Matt leaves me anywhere to bingo.
>Matt_Canik: GIOOPTT 8A P.OG +27 381
>Charles_Reinke: EIS 11E ......S +32 374
#note Matt: I can't challenge this, probably would have if I could win anyway.

Charles: My evil laugh is a bit rusty so I'll just sit here and smirk. 
>Matt_Canik: IOTT C10 TOIT +14 395
>Matt_Canik:  (EI) +4 399
#note Final: 401-374
