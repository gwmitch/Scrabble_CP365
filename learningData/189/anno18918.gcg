#note My scoresheet says this game was against Eric Tran.

So I know Eric is a great strategic player who puts emphasis on board control, but instead of trying to keep the board out of his control I decided that I wanted to reduce his options and control the board myself. This only takes an S, whereas JAM takes both a B and an S, and this doesn't stick an E out and allow very good overlapping plays like JAKE does. This was a difficult turn though, and factors such as keeping the Y to reoverlap overlaps with (JO)Y influence what play looks right here. That factor unfortunately did not spring to mind, which could have meant me making the wrong play, but I think I still like this a tad better than the other options, as I'm also setting my own M up, which is a small but interesting factor. Maybe I like to keep the board crippled too much on turn 1. "Even LEAKY sims better than my play. -4.5" -César del Solar. "There are 4 Jakes higher than me! :(" -Jake Blumer.

#note Ouch, I missed 9E OAK(Y). Nothing else to say about this play other than that it does not compare. ALKIE also looks better, and I didn't think it was valid.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEFILNO I7 OLE +23 81
#note Well he quite likely has the S here, but I can't really do anything about it. The point of playing this over FOE I6 was so that I could have a more flexible leave, since drawing into a bingo is rare here. I prefer to score more and be able to score next turn as well rather than gamble with a decent EILN leave. But EFIL is better than EFIN so I should play ONE instead.

#note Held and released. Eric's word knowledge is very good, which influenced my decision not to challenge. I had also seen this before. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFINRT 14E EF +30 111
#note This time I had to decide between playing EF or FE for 28, same spot. I figured that it wasn't necessary to open another bingo lane at this point, and that my chances of bingoing next turn wouldn't be much higher. I preferred not to play too open at this point. The board is far from being closed here. I don't think it's a good idea to open it further and increase Eric's chances of putting the game out of reach. Quackle thinks FE doesn't increase Matthew's chances of bingoing, but that it does increase mine, so perhaps I was wrong.

#note damn :/
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRRT J9 TRAINER +67 178
#note This is where perhaps playing FE would have helped my position, as I now most likely need two bingos of my own to get back in the game and I wouldn't have needed to open up huge scoring spots for Matthew. TERRAIN looks a bit better, same spot.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEGOPT 4C PO.TAGED +78 283
#note Now I challenged this, stupidly. I knew PORTAGED. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EHNORUX -  +0 178
#note I made too many errors already
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABY 3G BAY +34 317
>Joshua_Sokol: EHNORUX 2H HEX +42 220
#note But apparently challenging helped me to make this play that might shoot me back into the game. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEEV 15J .EAVED +33 350
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BINORU 6I RUBIcON +66 286
#note Unfortunately for me I miss a lot of words. I had a feelingthere was something ending in BUN(D) but missed mORIBUN(D), and I just whiffed on aIRBOUN(D). BOURsIN played, but I actually didn't think B(OLE) was a word! So my chances of coming back were severely reduced by yet another word knowledge mistake. This is phony, but neither of us realized, and it took me forever to find this even though it's phony. I should play at A8 because it leaves more bingo lanes open for the future.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEGGISU 6A AGUE. +10 296
#note Perhaps I need to take the points here? I decided the game was out of reach unless I 3x3ed or hit something at B1, but that's just not true. If I score 50 now I can come back in a lot of scenarios. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EORZ O4 ZO.ER +72 476
#note Or not, maybe I do need to 3x3...
>Joshua_Sokol: EGISV 1D GIVES +57 353
#note Don't remember my other two, but I know I didn't miss a bingo.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?HI O1 HIz..... +57 533
#note Sick! I held this, but I was pretty sure it was good and I can't win anyway
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIORTT A3 TER.TOID +80 433
#note So many mistakes... Eric Tran is a formidable opponent though.
