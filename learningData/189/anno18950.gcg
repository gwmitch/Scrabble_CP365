>Jim_Burlant: DEEFGTX 8H FEDEX +48 48
#note Best, and I was hoping for IN in my next rack for FEDEXING on the next turn.
>Seth_Lipkin: EGIOTUV 9B OUTGIVE +71 71
>Jim_Burlant: FGHIKNT D4 KNIGH. +36 84
#note So, barely one turn after looking for the FEDEXING extension...I miss it.  The clunk overload scrambled my brain.  The consolation prize:  he was going to bingo with OU(T)RIVAL through his first bingo if I'd played FEDEXING while I'd be sitting on FHKMT and 2 unknown tiles.
>Seth_Lipkin: AILORUV L4 VARI. +30 101
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEFIMT B8 F.rETIME +74 158
#note The other bingo is LIFETIME down the F column.
>Seth_Lipkin: AEU E3 EAU +16 117
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEINR A14 AA +16 174
#note Not much else to do with this - dump the A overload, kill the 3x3, and if I draw something like an L, S, or T, I should be golden.  Q agrees - 75% to win.
>Seth_Lipkin: ADILOSZ I2 DIAZOL.S +84 201
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEINR A4 AERIE +33 207
#note With 33 points available obvously turning the rack is in order.  But can someone explain why EERIE in the same location sims better than this?
>Seth_Lipkin: ?DINNOP 11A D.PONINg +70 271
>Jim_Burlant: BEEMNRT K7 B.RME +22 229
#note Right word, wrong place.  BERME scores 32 at B2.
>Seth_Lipkin: GUY B2 GUY +19 290
>Jim_Burlant: EELNPTW H1 WEPT +40 269
>Seth_Lipkin: LNO 5I .ON.L +28 318
>Jim_Burlant: DEEJLNT 2F JE.. +28 297
#note Hmmm.  Thought that playing short would help lengthen the game a bit.  Apparently I need to play JETON 6F for 6 more, I guess to prevent this:
>Seth_Lipkin: BY J4 B.Y +34 352
>Jim_Burlant: CDEHLNT L11 TENCH +30 327
#note Apparently I should just open up with F11 ITCH.  I merely saw 30 points and a board that had possibilities and left it at that.  ITCH wins 13%; this wins 10-1/2 and sims maybe 2 points down.  ITCH might have been much better.
>Seth_Lipkin: ACILOSS 14F CLASSI.O +70 422
#note Nice find!
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNOST N8 DALTONS +96 423
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNOST --  -96 327
#note My best legitimate play is 12K DEAL for 16.  I'm trailing by 95, I really dont' have a shot, so what do I have to lose by trying this?  Seth held me on this for a LONG time.  He admitted he had no idea whether CLASSICO took the S (it was a total guess myself), and was practically apologizing to me for challenging.  During the hold, he worked out the end game if he let it go,and realized that we would have tied. Under most circumstances he said he would have let me get away with this play, but he was in contention for a class prize and a tie would have done him in.  Good challenge.
>Seth_Lipkin: ATW 12D WAT +26 448
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNOST 7C A.ON +6 333
#note And I think I've so cleverly Q-stuck him.  I forgot about the all-too-easy QIS I12.
