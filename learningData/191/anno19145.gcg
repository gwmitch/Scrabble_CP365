>Matt: ABCENOO 8H ABOON +16 16
#note Another opening rack that I struggled with.  BEACON is 10 more points, was focused on plays that ditched both Os.  
>Henry: FFIM 9H MIFF +32 32
>Matt: BCDENTU 10G BUNT +26 42
#note CUNT makes the board very closed, but there is still NAMU# for a bingo lane.  I failed to take that into consideration.
>Henry: AGNOQU 11B QUANGO +36 68
#note Punished rightfully.
>Matt: ACDDEHX D8 HEX.D +40 82
#note Duh, I saw ADDAX but not from the A for 44. That has to be right, since HEXAD is uber volatile anyway, and CEH >>ACD.
>Henry: GOT 8A GOT. +24 92
>Matt: ACDILOR E9 LI.O +18 100
#note I was very foggy this game, right after lunch, and I overdrew here.  He overturned an S and threw it back.  And since my home township of CLARIDON* isn't any good, I didn't know what to do.  There are several interesting plays available, but 7J plays do very well in the sim.  Mine isn't all that great.
>Henry: ?IILMNT A1 LIMITiN. +83 175
>Matt: AACDERZ 6A .ZAR +32 132
#note I'm an idiot.  One might say I played this game in a DAZE.
>Henry: ADKNY E3 KANDY +40 215
#note Yup, that's about right.
>Matt: ACDEEOO 3C OA.ED +24 156
#note Bleh.  COOEE 7J with the D hook in hand seems like a good risk to take right here.  Blind to that lane.
>Henry: EIV D1 VI.E +26 241
>Matt: CEEEOPR 13A CEPE +33 189
#note And now I finally see the stupid HEXAD hook.  
>Henry: AINOSSU 12G SANIOUS +71 312
>Matt: ?EEORRS 14B REScORE +92 281
#note Great draw but I've thrown this game away.
>Henry: GRU 15H RUG +18 330
>Matt: AAAEISW 2F WAI +30 311
#note Maybe WAE 15A instead?  The leaves are similar but this gives back a lot.
>Henry: PRY 1H PRY +36 366
#note That could have been worse.
>Matt: AADEHJS 15A JA +30 341
#note That's a pretty powerful leave, maybe I'll stumble to a victory yet!
>Henry: ERTW M9 WRE.T +24 390
>Matt: ADEEEHS 11M .E +2 343
#note I'm not sure what this play accomplishes.  I don't have a hook for EE#, he most certainly has one, but I guess I could be feinting one if he doesn't have both L's yet, and at least he can't block row 4 plays at the same time.  
>Henry: EILV O8 VEIL +24 414
>Matt: ADEEHIS K1 SIDHE +27 370
#note HUIA# L11 sets up SEED to go out, is unblockable, and blocks his best play.  This is 10 worse.
>Henry: CLTT K11 C.LT +12 426
>Matt: AE L3 EA +17 387
#note I think that's my ugliest game so fa at this NSCr.  No missed bingoes, but lots of questionable decisions on the first 6 racks.
>Matt:  (T) +2 389
