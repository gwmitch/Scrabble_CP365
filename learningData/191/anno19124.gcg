#note Possibly my biggest mistake of the tournament. I haven't gone through all the 4's to make 5's, and for some reason had never seen TABUN. I challenge it instead of making the right play of (C)AGEY.
>David_Pearl: ENRSSTT L7 ST.NTERS +68 210
#note Now I have AAAEEGY and David plays a bingo with six consonants through the I. (however CAGEY would've given STERNEST). I've lost.

#note According to Quackle, I made the second-best play. I was almost certain VROUWS would lose, and I was hoping to draw A for VARIOUS. Unfortunately AW does not block column 4, while VAW prevents column A from being blocked, and IORSU bingos (unblockably) with 6 out of 9C2 = 36 two-tile combinations. AC, AR, CR, CU, FO, and FU. Quackle says VAW gives a 16.67% chance of winning, which is exactly 6/36.
