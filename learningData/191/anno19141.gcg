>John: DEGRY 9E GRYDE +32 32
>Matt: AIILRTT E9 .ILT +10 28
#note I did think about TI here.  The L is pretty good with AIRT, I should probably play that.  GILT's not terrible though.
>John: GJU 10I GJU +31 63
>Matt: AIMNRTT 11J AM +25 53
#note I really struggled with this rack.  I wanted to take the J spot, but the leave is very unbalanced.  AMRIT# is Quackle's suggested play, but with all those A's unseen that seems unnecessarily volatile right now.  I ruled out AMIN for te same reason.  Maybe MINT?
>John: EPRTW 12G TWERP +31 94
#note Not sure what his rack is here, if he had the blank here or not, but TWP# is intriguing.
>Matt: EINRSTT L4 RETINTS +78 131
#note I give slightly better letters to bingo through, but no S hook or Q/X bombs.
>John: ?ABEILO 6F bILOBA.E +65 159
#note He wasn't sure if this took the D or not.  I thought it might take a D, was sure it didn't take an S.
>Matt: AEGRSUV 4G GRAVU.ES +63 194
>Matt: AFILNTZ (challenge) +5 199
#note So SEVRUGA doesn't play, but lucky to have GRAVURES still. Wasn't too worried when he challenged since I've seen someone play this in a tournament.
>John: APR H12 .ARP +27 186
>Matt: AFILNTZ 14G F.AZIL +38 237
#note I originally put down FRIZ, then decided to dump the IL as well.  Maybe FIZ is better, but I didn't like that he could dump two tiles for 36+, and this obstructs the TWERP hooks somewhat.  
>John: DUW 3M WUD +26 212
>Matt: HLNNTUX 7K N.X +37 274
#note Ooh, I was so fixated on ditching the duplicated N that I missed the spot for TEX.  That scores 3 more and eliminates row 2 plays.  NIX does equally well in a 2-ply sim, and HLNNU is really inflexible, but it will be hard for him to score unless he hits L12.
>John: BOOY 2L BOYO +39 251
#note Since YOLO* hasn't been added to Collins yet, this play will have to do.  
>Matt: HILNOTU 1H LITHO +32 306
#note This protects against plays like HAD/HAN, scores well, and digs for ?SS.  
>John: AD 1N AD +31 282
#note Expected.
>Matt: ENNOQSU 12A QUES. +48 354
#note Take the points.  
>John: ADEFS 15K FADES +38 320
>Matt: EEEKNNO 8L .ONE +22 376
#note Quackle agrees.  The K should be valuable in the endgame, both for scoring and obstructing the board.  This scores well and blocks 80 point column O bingoes.  
>John: AACIINO -AACIINO +0 320
#note He made this exchange very quickly.  I suspected he was pulling the famous trade 7 with 7 in the bag gambit to learn my rack and plan the preendgame.  When I confirmed the tiles in the bag, I may have said "cheeky bastard" with a chuckle.
>Matt: EEEHKNN B11 K.NE +16 392
#note So I know he has the second blank now; he doesn't exchange 7 and throw the blank back in while behind.  I liked KUNE because it blocked the highest scoring bingo lanes, and saved some more firepower for the endgame.  Quackle really likes NEE(L)E 11B, and I think I can see why.  It accomplish the same thing my play does, and there are a lot of vowels left to draw, along with two Cs that will go well with HKN.  The only problem is that he can make a two tile fish at 10B to open up a TWS lane that might be difficult to block/outrun.  John liked this play, because he couldn't make any sort of play to open up extra lanes independent from rows 2 and 3. 
>John: ?AI 7E AI +3 323
>Matt: EEEHINT 7K ...E +13 405
#note With the case E's, and only two C's and an N for consonants, I think I'm in pretty good shape here.  I play off one tile for 13 points and let him have a 78 point bingo down column D; it's likely going to start with a C, and I will have something like HENCE for 30 as a comeback.  He's also down to 1:30 left on his clock, so it will be hard for him to calculate out a final fish to try and bingo out.  Quackle likes THEINE for 27.  I think that does outrun him if he plays COCAINe 3B for 87, but it's really close.  
>John: ?ACCINO D1 COCAINs +78 401
#note Low on time, he takes the bingo now.
>Matt: EEHINOT 1A NOT.H +30 435
#note Any of the 30 point plays is fine; leave doesn't matter when he has one tile left.
>John: O E1 .O +7 408
#note KO# is one more.  This game was really fun, and I'm proud of my effort here, along with some pretty timely draws.  
>John:  (EEI) +6 414
