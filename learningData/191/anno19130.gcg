#note ZOOEY was tempting, but I decided to see if I could play a closed board and killed the S hooks on KIN.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDELORV D3 VELCRO +28 159
#note I should admit that I was a little nervous about whether my preferred play COVED was good in TWL. Of course it is. VELCRO isn't awful, but it's a mistake. CODRIVE is another option.

#note This is a bad play. I missed the star play 13A FARINA which is best by a mile. But also A1 AFIRE, which I turned down because I wanted to block row 15, is a much stronger play. Also, with a lead like this I don't really want to be opening a big X bomb.

#note Key position. If Jason has the J or X and is able to score well, I'm going to need to bingo. I picked this because I may need NOVA, and row 2 is not so easy to block. I dunno. Quackle says to play AVISO for 6 more points. I'm pretty vexed by that. Why set up a big -SH bomb? Noah or someone else  please help me understand this position!
>Jason_Li: EHIJT 13A JET +32 297
#note After the game, Jason regretted not playing E3 AHI
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AEIOSS 2E AbIOSES +60 328
#note You couldn't ask for a more complicated pre-endgame! I can bingo and lose if Jason has the X-bomb. I can bingo and win if Jason has the X bomb and I still have the better endgame rack (big H play, he has V). I can bingo and win if Jason doesn't have the X bomb. I can bingo and lose if Jason doesn't have the X bomb, but the four tiles in the bag are gross. Then there are the not bingoing options. 5B SILO threatens an out-bingo to race whatever big scoring play Jason may have. And it makes row 2 very hard to block. If Jason does go the blocking route (most likely with ADO), then that opens the door for me to win with an X bomb, or something like SVARAJ. Of course, there are plenty of draws for me that dont give me bingos at all. There are a million things to consdier here and I don't think I could have taken them all into account even if I weren't a little pressed for time. Quackle says ABIOSES only wins about 65% of the time, where as SILO wins a whopping 80%. Bizarre! I wonder if  those sims have Jason making his best blocking play where it's available. Could use some discussion on this position too.
