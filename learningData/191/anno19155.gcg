>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW H6 WH.RFiNG +68 68
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW --  -68 0
#note Uh, I dunno. I guess I got confused between WHERVE and SWERFING#?
>Winter: ILNO 7H NOIL +15 29
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW J6 W..H +18 18
#note Wow, I didn't think to burn the blank, but it actually looks like a very intriguing option here. GOWF# and HOWF score quite nicely, and this board isn't likely to yield good value for a blank bingo, and it's also easier for Winter to play defense when he knows my rack. For all these reasons I guess WITH isn't the best idea.
>Winter: DIL 9J .ILD +10 39
>Winter: ADD (challenge) +5 44
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGNPQR -FGPQ +0 18
>Winter: ADD 6J .ADD +11 55
>Evans_Clinchy: ?NNORRU L2 ROUN. +12 30
#note The sim prefers NURD or RUND# in the same spot, which is better defensively and totally reasonable. I thought this gave me a little extra aggression - for him, it's tough to block my opening if he doesn't have the A or G, and for me, I'm more likely to draw an E for the juicy WITHE hook if I turn over an extra tile.
>Winter: AGNRW 1H WRANG +43 98
>Evans_Clinchy: ?MNORSY 10D MaSONRY +93 123
#note Whoa, MORNAYS# is a word. It plays for 109.
>Winter: ELZ 9C ZEL +27 125
>Evans_Clinchy: AACEJMU 11B CAUM +29 152
#note Missed MACULAE for 40. Really playing badly today.
>Winter: ENST M1 SENT +26 151

>Winter: QT 4H Q.T +22 178
>Evans_Clinchy: AACEITT 5E ACAI +23 194
#note Oh wow - sim suggests ACETIC B10, which is crazy aggressive. That might be the right approach, considering the game situation and opponent? Questionable after his last couple of plays. He could have a monster rack.
>Winter: EILO F1 OLEI. +9 187
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEOTTU B10 A.UTE +18 212
#note At this point, I thought it was time to play more open and create multiple areas to bingo. The bag is full of good stuff, so I'm confident I can draw something big within the next couple of turns. Sim prefers the more straightforward NUTATE H10, which I can understand.
>Winter: IINORV A5 VIRION +29 216
>Evans_Clinchy: EIIOPTV N2 VOE +30 242
#note Not the best draw, but at least this is a decent way to score.
>Winter: H 2I .H +26 242
>Evans_Clinchy: FGIIPST A12 GIFT +42 284
>Winter: EEG C6 GEE. +15 257
>Evans_Clinchy: BBEIPSY L8 B.YPE +30 314
#note Missed a couple things here - SYBBE# O4, which scores a ton and takes out a key hotspot, and PLEBBY# L8, which is also a lot of points and gives back fewer counterplays than BLYPE. Another bad play that would ultimately cost me.
>Winter: ?EOPSTU O4 SPOUTEd +82 339
>Evans_Clinchy: BIIORSX 12E BRIO +14 328
#note This is the right idea, but it actually works out two points better to tack on the S. This way I'm guaranteed to go out.
>Winter: ADEEK M12 DEEK +21 360
>Winter: A (challenge) +5 365
#note Winter smartly blocks my highest-scoring spot for SIX.
>Evans_Clinchy: ISX N14 XI +42 370
#note Best, but not enough. I challenged three words in this game (HILD#, WRANGS, DEEK#), so instead of winning the game by 8, I lost by 7. Painful.
