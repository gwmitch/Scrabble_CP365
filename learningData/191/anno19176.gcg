>Avery: HMNOSTX H4 MONTH +26 26
#note Avery: probably should have played it in the other spot because of the X. good call by Mack.
>Mack_: ABDEERY 7F BE.RAYED +68 68
>Avery: EGIJOSX 8J GOX +44 70
>Mack_: AAELNTU 8A LUNATE +25 93
>Avery: ?AEIJPS 5E JAl.PIES +114 184
#note Mack: that hurt
>Mack_: AAEIIRT 4K AI +10 103
>Avery: AHIORSV E8 .OVARISH +78 262
#note Avery: I saw BEHAVIORS and HAVIOURS, but this is obviously better
>Mack_: AEEIIRT 15E .IREE +24 127
#note Mack: No comment.
Avery: well HIREE is second if that's any consolation
>Avery: CELLUWZ 12C WU.ZEL +38 300
>Mack_: ?ADIKMT 14C DI.K +35 162
#note Avery: ooh find the best play here! DISK is second
>Avery: CILOOTU C1 LOCUTIO. +72 372
>Mack_: ?AFIMNT 1A FI.AMeNT +167 329
>Avery: AAEIOTY 13A AYE +26 398
#note Avery: easily the turning point of the game. I screw this up so badly and don't even spot YEA. 
>Mack_: BELOSSU 14H BOLUSES +78 407
#note Avery: what happened to my 210 point lead?
>Avery: AEIIOQT K11 TOQ.E +28 426
#note Avery: QI looks like an improvement, since there's 4 vowels left in the pool. Didn't see that or QAT. I think this is fine though.
Mack: I'd play QI and try to bingo.
>Mack_: DEEGNOW A12 W.GE +36 443
>Avery: AGIINRV 12J R.VING +24 450
#note Avery: CP likes VIG, but it's risky since Mack very well may have the other A. CP puts ROVING third, with INVAR 3J second. INVAR looks good to try for an ING bingo along row 10 or something. VIG has 45.61% win, INVAR 41.67%, and ROVING 41.06%. Not sure what to do.
Mack: ROVING looks wrong, but I'm not sure what else to do here
>Mack_: DENNORT 2B N.TED +36 479
#note This wins 81.25% of the time, but CP says Mack loses if he draws the D or R. His best shots are tough to spot, but win 87.5%. Can you find them?
>Avery: ACDFIPR 15M FID +28 478
#note this was a good brain exercise! If I have AACDFIP on my rack and Mack has NORR, there are two winning plays and one tying play. Each wins by one. if I have AACFIPR, there is one winning sequence, and it too wins by one. can you find all three?
>Mack_: ANOR O8 ORAN. +18 497
#note with AACFIRP, PIC 3L then AFAR (even at O3 after Mack plays DOC) wins by one. with AACDFIP, FACIAE M9 and FINDS N10 win by going out with either DIP 3L or PACA O7.
>Mack_:  (ACRP) +16 513
