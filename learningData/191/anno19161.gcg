#note I had no idea what to do here. This obvious sets up a ton of points for Lloyd, but at least I have a shot to bingo. 10J ALL is simming best, which seems very not obvious

#note Not good. I failed to consider how much better it is to open reliable seven lanes here. L4 TWO and similar plays look best

#note Passing up YURT to take out this C was a difficult choice, especially with the other Y still out. Lloyd can definitely outrun me without bingoing. Quackle says it's a mistake, with the WAXY spot being more important than the bingo. I'm losing about 1.5% apparently
