#note Not as dangerous as it looks, but still unnecessarily volatile. I didn't see I7 CYCAD, which looks excellent. 9C CANTO is the not bad version of my play. Weak.

#note I decided he probably didn't have a blank. Otherwise I might have pulled the trigger on D9 TAJ. That cutesy play distracted me from making the actually good play of 6B JATO. I need to retake Board Vision 101.

#note Now I'm fairly certain he is fishing with a strong non-blank leave. So I'll kill the lines and force him to have a flexible bingo rack.

#note Man, 6B VETO is sweet. It forces him to burn his S that he needs to bingo. If he doesnt, I just cash my blank there. I did actually consider 6D TO over the board for this reason, but somehow didn't make the obvious leap to VETO. I'm winning 99.96 percent no matter what though
