#note So, I saw THIEV(E)D, and then convinced myself THIEVING was an adjective, and that THIEVED# was Collins, even though it's a perfectly common word. Seriously, I did that. It wasn't until the next day that I realized I was thinking of WOLVED#. Even so, G(Y)VED is better than HEDG(Y). Wouldn't think this is how dictionary confusion would manifest itself, right?

#note Matt told me his rack here, but I can't remember it. We did conclude that he had a better play here.

#note A8 (WITCH)ING is worth a thought, but this puts Matt on the run now.

#note Wasn't sure what to do here for a sec, but finally this popped out. I hated not being able to hit 15H, but I can even outrun a bingo now, so it's not so bad.
>Matt_Graham: ACDEINN H8 .NNEADIC +86 336
#note I'm all ears, Marlon.
>dacrON: AADJLNS 14F JA.L +27 391
#note This seemed to put me in good shape, although I supposed I could conceivably be outrun.

#note 9D S(E)DA(N)S is one more point, drat. Props if you found that.
