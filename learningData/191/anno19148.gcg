>Michael_Bray: BDEGIO 8D BOGIED +26 26
#note I didn't even hold this, but after he drew I kinda realized that BOGIE does not equal BOGEY.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIIRY 9C GIE +12 12
#note Weak. I miss BEIGY every time. I know BEIGE doesn't compare so it's just ingrained in my mind that BEIGE can't be modified. BIGEYE also works.
>Michael_Bray: ADNR C9 .RAND +14 40
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNRTY 11C .NY +12 24
#note Y(I)N sets up TYIN which is cool but AYIN is too common of a hook.
>Michael_Bray: AEM 7G MAE +22 62
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRTV 12A VI.E +26 50
>Michael_Bray: UUU -UUU +0 62
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENRTTU 14C sTUNTER +65 115
#note Wow, I actually thought this was a word, and thought he might challenge GRANDS. Matt, you fool! Didn't know the combo of GRUTTEN/TURGENT.
>Michael_Bray: CP H13 C.P +21 83
#note Lucky.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFNOPTT A12 .ENT +21 136
#note Bad leave but trying to make it harder for Mike.
>Michael_Bray: OTW 7C WOT +18 101
>Matthew_Larocque: FIJOPST 6B JO +30 166
>Michael_Bray: EHU 5C HUE +21 122
>Matthew_Larocque: FGIPRST 6H GRIFT +19 185
#note Seemed like the turnover was too good to pass up with this rack.
>Michael_Bray: EIW K4 WI.E +20 142
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEKOPS 8K SPOKE +53 238
#note I figured POKE for 36 was a nice play, but 17 extra points is a lot. At this stage I think pure scoring is really all I need to do.
>Michael_Bray: ?AIIRSS O7 S.nARIIS +58 200
>Michael_Bray: ?AIIRSS --  -58 142
#note When I challenged he basically knew that he had played a phony. This really set him back.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINORX 9M XI +40 278
>Michael_Bray: ?AIIRSS 10A AI. +5 147
#note Taking into consideration that he doesn't know/can't find the bingos, he's better to play something like F3 AIS to give himself more ground to bingo on.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEENORR 13H .ORNERED +77 355
#note Yes I just drew that.
>Michael_Bray: ?IRSS F4 IS +9 156
>Matthew_Larocque: ABELMOZ 3C ZOEAL +33 388
#note A horribly misguided attempt to block. I saw MABE/BEMA 12L for 36 keeping the Z for scoring, but I thought I should at least make this line a little harder to use. Why didn't I just form LIS instead? or play MA(I)ZE which is 1000x better. Or I can just play MAZE L1, likely draw another A, and score so much that his bingo won't even matter much. I mean, this doesn't change the outcome or anything, but damn it sure was a bad play. BEL(D)AM is pretty cool too.
>Michael_Bray: ?ACRSST 2F ReCASTS +69 225
>Matthew_Larocque: BDFMUU L12 F.UD +20 408
#note Now I have to deal with this junk, didn't even block his bingo, had so many better plays last turn etc....
>Michael_Bray: AIV 15L .IVA +24 249
>Matthew_Larocque: ABLMOQU O4 QUAL. +24 432
#note AQU(A).... seriously Matt.
>Michael_Bray: AAHLNOY A7 HOY. +30 279
>Matthew_Larocque: BLMO 4I BO.L +18 450
>Michael_Bray: AALN 1L ANLA +18 297
>Michael_Bray: AALN --  -18 279
#note Wasn't sure if he meant to play ANAL or got confused with the AN?A words, but we didn't even use the word judge so must have been the first one.
>Matthew_Larocque: M 6N M. +10 460
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AALN) +8 468
#note Some real bad choices at the end there, part of the reason my spread was unimpressive for the amount of wins I had.
