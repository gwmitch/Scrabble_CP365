#note I considered this play and PO(I)ND at 3K. Both set up QADI or QAID with an I draw, but it seems too likely that he will block after PO(I)ND, and that on this board it might be nice to give him fewer options, especially as it may take a turn or two to offload this Q.
>Jerry_Lerman: BEGGMNS 12B BEGS +28 131
>dacrON: AIPQSVY 1L QAI. +24 201
#note Could be hindsight bias, but I really wanted to block the E here, and wish that maybe I'd taken 13A QIS or C11 PEAVY. C9 YIP(E)S is interesting, as well. Thoughts on this play?

>dacrON: AEPRSVY 15C .PAYER +39 240
>dacrON: AEPRSVY --  -39 201
#note The only other intentional phoney I tried this tournament, and what a bad effort. RA(S)PY is better than this, anyway, and I totally missed it (????). This was unusually greedy of me, and Jerry knocked it off after about 30 seconds.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADELOOT 15C .TOOLED +24 231
#note Maybe (s)OOTED to prevent me dropping YAP for cheap?
>dacrON: AEPRSVY 14F YAP +35 236
>Jerry_Lerman: AAFGLRT 13G GAL +18 249
#note Tough decision here for Jerry - some other options might include L10 (S)TALAG, or 11H FAT, but this play seems pretty good, too.
>dacrON: EEIMRSV 8A IM. +21 257
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ACFRST D2 FACToRS +83 332
#note Jerry originally put down FRACTuS then changed to this play.
>dacrON: EEIORSV O9 EROSIVE +86 343
>Jerry_Lerman: AABEOTU C1 BOA +19 351
#note OUTBEA(M) scores best and maximizes the chances of drawing the Z, which could be the key to the game here. It also gives more chances to draw some scoring tiles.
>dacrON: ADEENOZ 6B ZO.NED +37 380
#note 6D (o)OZE looks like it may win a couple more endgames, setting up my D. Either of these plays seem pretty solid though, - it'll take a really funky draw to lose at this point.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEELTUW -  +0 351
#note Jerry challenges, not knowing ZOON was verbified in 2006.
>dacrON: AEHNY 12J HYENA. +24 404
>dacrON:  (AEELTUW) +20 424
#note My poorly timed phoney doesn't stand, but I play solidly after that to hold on.
