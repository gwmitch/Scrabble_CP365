>Philip_Nelkon: EKRT 8F TREK +16 16
>Evans_Clinchy: AENOOSW 7G OW +14 14
#note Sim prefers WOT F6 - same score and leave, different board dynamics. Disagree. Especially with a questionable leave like AENOS that can backfire if I draw vowels, it's safer to keep the board tight and wait to open later.
>Philip_Nelkon: FOO 6H OOF +20 36
>Evans_Clinchy: AEMNOST 9B MANTOES +74 88

>Philip_Nelkon: EGIU 8K .IGUE +24 149
>Evans_Clinchy: AAINUUV J10 UNAU +12 142
#note The sim is messy - this is one of a few options. There's this, there's the other UNAU to the right, and there's UVA# L3, which is a little better for keeping the board nice and open.
>Philip_Nelkon: DEJX D7 J..XED +42 191
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEHIVV E4 VIVA +29 171
>Philip_Nelkon: DENU E9 .UNED +28 219
>Evans_Clinchy: AEHLORR C11 HORA +24 195
#note Figured I needed to get crafty and give myself another area to bingo. I like HORA because it sets up my L. Sim results are close - HORA and HORAL are both looking decent.
>Philip_Nelkon: FILOS 15A FILOS +35 254
>Evans_Clinchy: EILRRTW L1 WRITE +26 221
#note The good news is there's no possible rack with a blank with which FILOS makes sense. So he doesn't have one yet - although he did just draw five tiles. I figure since I'm down 59, I need to live dangerously, swinging the board wide open and hoping I can bingo first. Another complicated sim with a lot of things in the mix - WURLIE# 13I valuates best, but that might make it too easy for him to control the board. I think I like WRITE best.
>Philip_Nelkon: ABSYY 1J BY.AYS +51 305
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ELMORT 3G ROLaM.TE +72 293
#note I struggled a lot with choosing among the various bingos available - I wanted the right balance of "volatile but not too volatile," so I settled on this. Stupidly, though, I overlooked MOTELIER# in the exact same spot for 4 extra points.
>Philip_Nelkon: ?EEILNP O7 P.LErINE +60 365
>Evans_Clinchy: AADGNOP N10 PAGODA +54 347
#note I got a little tilty and just slapped this down without counting the bag - PAGOD is probably better because it doesn't empty. But, uh, I'm gonna lose anyway.
>Philip_Nelkon: DEEQRRZ 2F REZ +27 392
#note A cool endgame play by Phil, who sets up DZO# and forces me to find a block with an awkward rack.
>Evans_Clinchy: BCIILNT 4H LIB +24 371
>Philip_Nelkon: DEQR 5D Q. +11 403
>Evans_Clinchy: CINT M3 .IC +12 383
#note Low on time so I threw down something random. This is the 13th best play - go me! INCUT# is my only out and I didn't know it.
