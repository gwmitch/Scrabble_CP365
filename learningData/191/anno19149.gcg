>Matthew_Larocque: AIOORRS L4 ARIOSO +23 37
#note Leaves were not good enough to play short here IMO.
>Noella_Ward: AEOZ 12H ZO.AE +48 58
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DIINRT H12 .ITI +39 76
#note Passed on bingoing, this seemed like it should be better. Of course it could also turn very wrong.
>Noella_Ward: AGM 11I G.MA +27 85
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DENRWY M9 WRY +33 109
#note This time I just missed UNDERWAY and did not know WARDENRY which scores 78 at 5F. Noella held GAMAY for a bit.
>Noella_Ward: DEER M3 REED +17 102
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DELNSY 7B DENSeLY +67 176
#note This is the only bingo I saw here so thankfully it played. DYNEL K2 and D(O)YEN 7K score enough that they sim on par with the bingos, but I didn't see them - and I think I had put off playing a bingo long enough.
>Noella_Ward: IQ G13 QI +44 146
>Matthew_Larocque: ILOSTUX 8A LOX +42 218
>Noella_Ward: HO 6E OH +27 173
>Matthew_Larocque: GIIJSTU 5C JUG +30 248
#note JIG or JUG? I spent more time here than I really needed to, but generally I just don't like keeping Us and there's 3 more anyways.
>Noella_Ward: ABN K4 NAB +25 198
>Matthew_Larocque: EIISTUV 2I UVEITIS +92 340
#note Yeah, 92 with UVII on my rack. This is a thing that actually happened. She held for a bit on this one too.
>Noella_Ward: AI 1N AI +14 212
>Matthew_Larocque: CDFIPUW 9F CUP +16 356
#note Creating S hooks kind of goes against closing the board, but this rack didn't leave me with much alternative. I suppose I could have just played DUP.
>Noella_Ward: DENR 4D NERD +19 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFILUW F14 FA +27 383
#note WILDU I know, but I don't think I can lose if I just score well.
>Noella_Ward: EN 1H EN +8 239
#note Wonder what else she had here, seemed like she would want to keep this open. It's not that easy for me to use or make a worthwhile block.
>Matthew_Larocque: DILOTUW 1K WO +14 397
#note Might as well do 9A for the sake of board killing.
>Noella_Ward: CE C7 ..EC +14 253
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DILTTU 9B T.L +7 404
#note I think I used a lot of time here - I don't know why. I can't score anyways so I just need to block.
>Noella_Ward: EGM 3B MEG +16 269
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDIPTU 2A PUB +26 430
#note Maybe she doesn't have the O....
>Noella_Ward: HO 1A OH +35 304
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEFIST 11A FISTED +34 464
#note No time so I just score points. Fishing off the F bingos with 5 of 8 remaining letters seems like. Pretty sure my tracking wasn't up to date so it's moot.
>Noella_Ward: AEKLNRT A11 .LANK +39 343
#note I probably shouldn't have let her score 39 points.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?N B13 No +6 470
#note UNBID.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ERT) +6 476
#note I lost 20 on time and somewhere I lost 10 more due to some faulty math. This always happens, really need to pay more attention.
