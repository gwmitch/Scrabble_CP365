#note WYE looked like the points play, but the parallels it opens up are just too strong. So burn some equity to avoid that. But duh, do it with WYLE.

#note I didn't look too hard for LACONISM after I found this. I'd much rather take out Lloyd's easy bingo line.

#note He said he considered just doing HUB, which would have been a bit scarier for sure.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEIRT 13L RAIA +23 323
#note I dunno, maybe AE? I really didn't want to keep 5 1-pointers on this board. And it still left a bingo line open to ES. I think RAIA is the play.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEENNOT 3C A.ON +26 349
#note Dammmnnn I looked for a killer overlap but was blind to ALT and missed ANENT to complete seal this game. This mistake gives him a glimmer of hope with many bingo tiles and the X unseen.
