>Matt: AHLOTTT 7H THAT +26 26
>Geoff: ?EILOTZ 6B ZeOLITE +90 160
>Matt: LLNNOST -NLL +0 26
#note Didn't know TONNeLLS#.  And I thought this rack was junk.  Maybe I have a shot if I find that.
>Geoff: ?ABCEMR C6 .MBRACEd +82 242
#note As it is, this game is pretty much over after 3 turns
>Matt: EGINOST 12C .GESTION +70 96
#note I have really good spread at this point, and chasing a 3x3 could lead to me losing a lot of it in just this game.  
>Geoff: IQ J10 QI. +32 274
>Matt: AANPRSY 6J YAP +33 129
>Geoff: BFU 5K FUB +34 308
>Matt: ALNPRRS 11I P.RN +16 145
#note I should play PARR, too many points to pass up.  It does devalue my S a little bit though.

>Matt: ADELRSW N2 WARSLED +85 230
>Geoff: JO M3 JO. +44 368

>Geoff: ACEMNV 10B C.VEMAN +26 394
>Matt: AEEIRTV O1 VERA +43 298
#note Missed some pretty fits at 11C.  I think this is still better though, he's likely to play there soon.
>Geoff: IKO 11E KOI +36 430
#note KOI scores 36 at O1 as well, and maybe he has a -OKE play for even more.
>Matt: EEIIOTY 8A TO.Y +39 337
#note The leave is awful, but there are not many vowels left to draw, so I'm OK with taking the points here.
>Geoff: INS 13H NIS +25 455
>Matt: DEEGIIX M9 XI +36 373
#note Setting up my D.
>Geoff: ALSW M12 LAW +20 475
#note Nice setup to go for a 4th bingo.
>Matt: DEEGHIO N13 HOG +31 404
#note Blocking S hooks; he could have pulled into FULGORS#.
>Geoff: FGORSUU O14 GU +25 500
#note Quackle suggests FUG 14F setting up SOUR for 27, but this is  better because I didn't notice his better outplay.
>Matt: DEEILT 13C .ID +15 419
#note Missed FUROLS#.  Take the points at 5D.
>Geoff: FORSU E2 FURO.S +18 518
#note Not a lot I can do here besides finding TONNeLLS#.  And now I get to play Adam Logan.
>Geoff:  (EELT) +8 526
