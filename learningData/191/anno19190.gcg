#note Debated this or 3B WURST. Didn't consider I6 EWER, which is winning the sim. I do not understand that play at all. I guess the points are worth it.

#note I could also just do BIZ to keep the rack intat. I dunno, I was pretty tempted by the points. This is a significant error, though.

#note Uh, oops. I didn't even realize he'd played BANN* until his hand was in the bag. I still could have called hold, but I hesitated for a second and it was too late.

#note Ugh. The J-bomb and the N2 bomb. The J is probably more likely. I still did this wrong. G3 ZETA just outruns. M9 LATHI and 13M ATE block the actually more dangerous line. At least this turns over 5. Still... bad.
