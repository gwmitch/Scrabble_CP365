>Lewis_Saul: BBEIL H4 BIBLE +24 24
>Richard_Spence: EEEELNR -EELN +0 0
#note (B)EE is superior to exchanging.
>Lewis_Saul: AGINU 8D GUIN.A +9 33
>Richard_Spence: EFNOPRR I2 PROF +19 19
#note Best play, as it rids FOPR while keeping a nice leave.
>Lewis_Saul: ?ADEEIM 9I MEDIAtE +70 103
#note Not sure if this was the safest bingo. I had junk though.
>Richard_Spence: EEINNRR O6 ERN. +12 31
#note Quackle likes (P)INNER, but I'm not leaving that E in the 3x3 spot.
>Lewis_Saul: OVW N4 VOW +30 133
>Richard_Spence: AEGIINR 6F GI. +10 41
#note I probably should've just dumped I rather than GI, but I'm not sure if I agree with Quackle's play of (AM)I. Maybe I(N)/I(t) for 3.
>Lewis_Saul: CFHL L8 F.LCH +34 167
>Richard_Spence: AEEINRT K2 RETAINE. +73 114
#note This sims best
>Lewis_Saul: AUV 3M VAU +22 189
>Richard_Spence: AELMRST 10H LAM +26 140
#note Quackle slightly prefers AM; I'm not sure if I agree.
>Lewis_Saul: CIINT D3 CITIN. +18 207
>Richard_Spence: EEORSTU J1 RUE +15 155
#note Meh, I saw E(C)U, which I probably should have done.

>Lewis_Saul: ADGO 12A GOAD +26 247
>Richard_Spence: ELQSSTW 10C STEW +38 267
#note I keep the Q, hoping to possibly draw an I for QI J6. I missed SLEW, most likely because I was going to play TEW, but then tacked the S on at the last moment.
>Lewis_Saul: IX J6 XI +52 299
>Richard_Spence: KLNQRSS N9 .R.NKS +22 289
#note Wow, I blundered here. TRANQS.
>Lewis_Saul: AJOT 14J JOTA. +28 327
>Richard_Spence: DEHILQS 4C Q. +11 300
#note Really cool play here. Drawing E or T gives me a triple-triple, which I doubt he'd block (at this point), given that there are two O's and ZERO or ZOO or ORZO seem likely. If he does manage to block the 3x3, I have (LA)SHED or LI(T)H 5B, which likely lose, but it minimizes spread.
>Lewis_Saul: DEORYYZ 15G ZERO +48 375
#note From his perspective, 3 out of 36 letter combinations give a 3x3: DELIGHTS, SLOUGHED, and EULOGIST. Not blocking gives a 1/12 chance of losing, so playing (O)OZY or YE is the best play. I might have done YE if I saw all three 3x3s, since HYE* and IYE*.
>Richard_Spence: DEHILST A8 DELI.HTS +167 467
#note Phew!
(also, this is probably the first time I've triple-tripled out)
