#note Yeesh, FHHWY were like power tiles early in this game.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEORT 6B AORTAE +13 105
#note The draw is annoying, but I should still try to make a better play. EYEWEAR and EYEWATER are available for more points. And N10 AE is perfectly reasonable too.

#note I don't normally get rattled, but I was kind of on tilt here.

#note This play may be a mistake because it eliminates the top half of the board as potential bingo lines. But I duinno, it's not easy for Wayne to close the bottom anyways. 5H CWM is not a bad option, but the bag is quite vowel heavy here.
>Wayne_Barclay: IV B1 VI. +14 320
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?NPPRTW 2A P.P +13 275
#note Plays through the A's clear more consos, but I am SURELY going to draw two vowels this time. And I want to leave the A and B columns open.
>Wayne_Barclay: NTV B6 .V.NT +10 330
#note A shocking play from my PoV. Apparently we were both consonant heavy and the bag was like 11 vowels, 2 consonants, and a blank.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EENRTW 10B .EW. +20 295
#note Drawing SE for BESTREWN was a real possibility.
>Wayne_Barclay: EIRS 5H SIRE +14 344
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EENQRT O5 Q. +11 306
#note I did consider L1 QUEEN, but I absolutely have to infer from Wayne's last play than the bag currently contains 5 vowels.
>Wayne_Barclay: EO 10G OE +5 349
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CEENRT 12B CENTERs +69 375
#note If I specify FS? as a partial oppo rack, C10 EN sims to the top. Not sure why? I always lose if he has the bingo and I always win if he doesn't, either way. Either I'm missing something or the duck is smoking quack.
