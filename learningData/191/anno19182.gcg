#note Stupidly missed VAUTE# in the same spot. Also, EUOI# K10 might be better, keeping a solid leave and chasing for bingos on a decent board.

#note With one in the bag and the pool of QCOGNISE, I decided to pass. My thinking was that if he has COGNISE, I want him to play it now, then draw the Q so I can stick him with it. This is potentially disastrous! There's a Q spot at C2 that I didn't notice, which means if he has something like QOGNISE, he can play QAT first and then have a bingo out in two spots and I'm screwed. Then again we're both really low on time, so passing quickly puts the onus on him, and maybe he'll miss the fishing opportunity.
>Mark_Kenas: CEINOQS 8K .CO +8 365
#note Mark ends up with not enough time to figure out a "bingo in two spots" strategy, so instead he sets up a high-scoring QIS spot to cut some spread.
>Evans_Clinchy: EGILNRR 8K ...LE +21 452
#note At this point, I'm similarly time-panicked, so I... make up a phony five. Who can keep track of which French words are good, anyway?!
>Mark_Kenas: EGINQS N10 QINS +42 407
>Evans_Clinchy: GINRR O4 RING.R +8 460
#note Um, GIRNER# in the same damn spot. What a ridiculous endgame.
