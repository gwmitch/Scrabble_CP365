#note (BEAU)T/TA(L)K definitely better, totally wasnt thinking like that, some weird options here like (U)M(I)AK, i dont like balancing plays like V(I)TTA or M(I)TT or MATT over the points of the other plays but KAT(A) definitely sucks

#note normally i would do TEL here, but I figured the spot would still  be open cause of my opponent after my next play which was almost guaranteed to be a bingo

#note she told me a few plays earlier that it was illegal to cover my scoresheet so I called the director over and had him explain to her that it wasnt. she then very snidely made a comment about me having something written on the scoresheet and I had the director check it, then she said 'what about the back?' and he checked that and said it was nothing. after he walked away she said 'i didnt really think you were cheating.' ... so yeah, this was for spite
