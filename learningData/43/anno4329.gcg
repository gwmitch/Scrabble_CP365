#note Pretty tough play.  Depends on Adam's range.  I'm guessing Adam's range here is pretty close to optimal. Rafi pointed out trading to me, which seems correct in hindsight though I probably couldn't see myself doing this over the board.  Especially since I wanted a more dynamic board against Adam, who I feel is the best player at shut down boards in the tournament, and maybe the world. Playing IAMBI is more thematic to what I want against Adam, but I feel as though -II is probably the technically superior play.  Since I'm coin flipping against Adam anyway, maybe that's right.  I'll leave the decision to those who know better.

#note Keeping the IK leave is better for luck.  And at 14-6, I need to win here very badly to keep hope alive.
