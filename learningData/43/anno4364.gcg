#note I guess he has two Ts or Is.  But since it's Ian, probably not.  He's probably better off playing TAV, but whatever. 
>Kenji: ADEGORT I3 GAROTED +73 73
#note Maybe I should play GAROTTED here.  That way I can close down lane I and get the closed board that I want.  Nah, I can just play through the I or T next turn, plus I might not draw an E for a while, and he can just open up the bottom quadrant after GAROTTED.  Don't be arrogant, your opponent isn't that bad... stay sane.
>Ian: ADEFLMN E8 .NFLAMED +78 102
#note Of course if I played what I wanted to play...
>Kenji: AKLNORT D12 KORA +40 113
#note Well I don't really have much of a choice here, do I?  I'm certainly not gonna play KOR and give him those points easily.  
>Ian: EEGILNY 3F GIN.ELEY +78 180
#note Ian:  78.  *pause*  *Draws very slowly, moves his hands to the bag very slowly, takes him about 10 seconds to grab the bag*.  Ian:  "Did you want to hold?"  Kenji:  Of course not!  Do I want to hold?  What kind of a question is that?  *rolls eyes*  Pfft.  Ian:  Sorry.  (thought)  yeah, I'm sure you're sorry.  As if we didn't already have our problems before this game.
>Kenji: ILNSTTX J6 XI +52 165
#note Another forced play.

#note Nice draw, Kenji.  
>Ian: EF F13 EF +35 258
>Kenji: ?ENOPST K5 POSTErN +95 260
#note That's much more like it.  Of course I'm still behind so I can use the S hook, making two S hooks total.
>Ian: IWY H1 WI.Y +51 309
>Kenji: BEEEGIU 2J BE +22 282
#note Nice draw.  Let's just try to get out of this as comfortably as possible.  Missed REFUGEE entirely, which isn't a good sign, even though it's not clear that it's best.  This miss I'm okay with, as it's a pretty tough find, but I should still find it.  It's not even that big of a difference.  Trading here is also okay.
>Ian: DHIRT 1K THIRD +42 351
>Kenji: ?AEEGIU 8K .EGUA +21 303
#note Okay, I see EUGENIAS, but this is just a disaster waiting to happen.  Simply put, no thanks, as I can't ever come back after that, down 11, a tempo, and having no chance to ever outplay Ian on this type of board.  If he has even a mediocre rack, I'm really dead, and I'm so far behind that I can't outplay him by enough.  (The Duck likes bingoing by 3.  I still don't.)
>Ian: ARSSUUU 11J U.AUS +5 356
#note TILT alert!!!!!!!!  Have you lost your mind Ian?  What the fuck do you have?  Okay, settle down.  Maybe he have ENS.  No, then he has SAU.  Maybe he has the last U and another S, like URS.  No, then he's play URUS.  Oh, who are you kidding Kenji?  You know that's not what he has.  He just has some random rack that he should be scoring with but thinks he's being clever by closing all the immediate bingo lines.  Just let it go, you still have lines like lines o and G, and you can still make setups.  You might even get a Q stick on or some big play.  Just relax.
>Kenji: ?CEILOZ L11 .ZOIC +38 341
#note There.  See?  You're down 15, and you'll probably be down 40 and you have lines and all sorts of possibilities.  You can still hit lines D, F, 13, and O even after he takes the C spot, and you'll have a few turns to shoot at it.  You're fine.
>Ian: EOV 15L .OVE +27 383
#note Cool.  Nothing stupid happened.
>Kenji: ?AEELOU F8 .OEA +17 358
#note Okay, well at least you drew the last U.  This means it's time to look at Q block options.  Well, there's two Q spots.  Oh, AUrEOLAE almost plays.  Anyway, there's still time.  I do need to score, though, and I need a rack to maybe win with just the Q or make a setup.  TOEA does block line D and inhibits line G, but I do need to score.  As long as I get the Q or can score I'll be fine.  If I don't get the Q, then I need to probably block QUAI, but he needs to draw the A and the I/D.
>Ian: ADQ 14J QA.D +37 420
#note Fuck.  He gets 37 and blocks.  And he missed QUAD for 45!  WTF!  Fucking best players in the world, are you kidding me?
>Kenji: ?ELRSSU 11B U. +5 363
#note Okay, well I clearly need to make a setup.  REcUSALS isn't going to work anymore, though it would have worked before QAID.  This sucks.  Well, SH is a better setup, but it gets blocked by MIC or TIC too early, and of course they might have the A.  I guess UH bingos if I can draw it next turn, plus I can always get SLITTERS if he tries to block the lane.  (Note, this is obviously where I lost the game.  I'm such a retard.  UH doesn't even make any sense, really.  I just starting thinking spastic starting about 3 turns ago, and though passing up EUGENIAS isn't too stupid, and playing TOEA is sane, this clearly was not.  And it was clearly caused by my previous thinking during the game; clearly this isn't the same focus I have in my other games.)

>Kenji: ?ELLNRS 13K L. +4 377
#note If I play off the S, Ian blocks with TRIADS.  At the time, I think there's no way Ian would ever find that though.  It's Worth trying if the score were closer; alas...
