#note didnt see HE(R)EInTO but wasnt really looking, i still think this is my play, gives up about 14% through 100 iterations

#note E(R)G/CHIDE blocked a nice way to score/bingo with the O, but with EEEE still out I shoulve taken the points for (B)EE and not worried about blocking that lane or using EE. ETI(C) was another possibility but i didnt like EGO? over EIOT? at this point cause i am relying on bingoing. overall a pretty dismal play but not as bad as quackle's 17% through 250 iterations imo

#note aM(B)IEnTS is beautiful, find the one to the P i didnt know, or the one from the N that is a normalish word but you hardly ever see on a board. on a better player with that pool I would hold off bingoing and probably play EMI(C) leaving one in the bag but I blocked every lane except the one @ E2 and was confident she didnt have the goods after playing off for points and not fishing. perhaps its a good thing I didnt see the flashier bingoes cause of all the ones quackle generated MISTiEr wins most often @ 85%ish
