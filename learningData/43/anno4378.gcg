#note I liked the Q setup. Duck likes M(E)WLING at L7. Still like the Q setup. (-3)
>Win_Inthara: EEFLORV H1 OVERFEL. +95 107
#note This is why my challenge skills suck. I think "He played this right away, confidently; he had LEFTOVER; the Thais don't phony much; he's rated higher than me, so I can assume better word knowledge ... better let it go." At no point did I think that ... OVERFELT* IS A F***ING RIDICULOUS WORD!!! I hate myself.

#note Win was obviously wading through junk here, but he said after the game that he was grateful that there were spots to score with it.
>Jason: AAEIKPS 5E KAI. +22 145
#note This is definitely not going well so far...

>Jason: DEHRRTU 9C HURT +13 236
#note Win was started to get visibly frustrated ... wish I had a big scoring play in return here. Duck likes TRU(T)H, 5J. (-3)
>Win_Inthara: INS 8A INS +14 266
>Jason: DEEORSX 14E REDOXES +76 312
#note I knew it was close between this or OX at N5. Here was my logic: If Win bingoes off of the opening I create with OX, I'm in big trouble. But, even if Win scores decently off of this, I'll still lead on turn, and I can maybe shut down the only bingo line (through the I). Close call, but giving Win an S, Duck likes this.
>Win_Inthara: DIN 15H DIN +32 298
#note FWIW, Win said the I was his only vowel here and he would've had nothing coming off of OX.
>Jason: FGINNRV A5 VIN.NG +10 322
#note Right idea, says Duck, but why not VIRG(I)N? (-1)
>Win_Inthara: EEGRSTZ 6L Z.G +17 315
#note Down this went, then Win picked it up and continued to sigh. I realized the blank was in the bag. I figured I'd see GAZES at 15A to sink my battleship. Duck says this is the clear play.
>Jason: AACFPRU 5M .AP +8 330
#note I think this is the only play that blocks the -S hook. Too far off of Speedy's radar to be considered by CP, but I don't know what else to do. Do I have to just hope he doesn't have it and play FA(N) at B6 or something since I can easily get outpointed after blocking?
>Win_Inthara: EEORSTT 15A RETEST +31 346
#note I block ROSETTE and Win is still acting like someone who's lost, even after this goes down.
>Jason: ?AACFRU O1 CRAU.s +43 373
>Jason: ?AACFRU --  -43 330
#note Since Win is still pouty, I assume he sees something at O1 that I don't. So, I play this, Win holds then challenges. "You know it?" he asks. I admit I don't. He sighs. "It's good," he says. The challenge computer says otherwise. Win was definitely surprised. (-46)
>Win_Inthara: O 10A .O +12 358
#note Frustrating. Two consecutive crappy draws post-bingo. But, I have *got* to stop losing games by keeping phonies on...
