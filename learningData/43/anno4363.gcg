>Jan_Dixon: ?ADEGST 8F STAnGED +70 70
>Sam: KMPQRYZ K7 P.RKY +28 28
#note A tough position to start off with. I didn't notice ZYME, but PERKY might be better anyway. I thought trading would be giving too much up.
>Jan_Dixon: DEGNOOU F2 NOODGE. +15 85
#note Jan's real rack--I guess she either didn't notice NOODGED, or thought the word was only a noun.
>Sam: ABMNOQZ 4C BOZ. +30 58
#note AMBO E2 sims best, which is weird...BOZO seems clearly best for many reasons to me.

#note This looks like my worst move of the game so far. Not sure what's best--APORIA 7J? NAIRA 4H? I think I was screwed no matter what I played though (well, I guess with knowledge of Jan's rack INROAD isn''t so bad). 
>Jan_Dixon: ?DEJSTU B6 JoUSTED +88 339
>Sam: AINORSW C6 OW +26 208
#note Some other options are WOS K3, WINOS K1, NAW 2A, or WAINS 4H, but I think this play is fine.
>Jan_Dixon: EEFILT L2 FILETE. +26 365
#note Good play!
>Sam: ACEINRS M3 NARIC +40 248
>Jan_Dixon: OPRV H1 PROV. +42 407
>Sam: AEILOSU 1G U.O +5 253
#note SOU 9B is clearly best here. Maybe I was demoralized at the end of a long day, or just didn't think about the A8 hotspot. I don't really know. 
>Jan_Dixon: IX A8 XI +56 463
>Sam: AEEILRS 6B ..E +10 263
#note Quackle likes REI 6H, which is definitely a better bet than my play.
