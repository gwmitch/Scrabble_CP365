#note it doesnt bother me that I missed Al(I)ENAGE so much, what bothers me is I thought of AGENESIA and ALIENAGE as the only two and concluded they didnt play anywhere. lots of better non bingo choices too, this play just plain sucks.

#note about effing time! she held and said she didnt know the word but eventually let it go. she said after the game that she shouldve challengedl; I laughed and said it wouldnt have done much good. She didnt find it funny and explained that just from a strategy perspective she shouldve challenged cause she loses if its good; THAT much i agreed with her on.
