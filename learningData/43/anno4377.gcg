>Sam: EFNTWYY F6 FE.NY +27 27
#note The sim likes WEFT better by about two points. I was way too scared to keep two Ys, but WEFT is a strong defensive play. :(
>Jason_Idalski: BEEETTU E10 BEET +19 37
#note BUTE looks better to me, both in terms of leave and defense.

>Jason_Idalski: ADFHIQZ E3 QADI +33 141
#note Jason missed the nice HAFIZ 13J
>Sam: ?DEIIOT B8 DIOrITE +80 156
#note Thought TWITTY* might have been good.
>Jason_Idalski: EFHLLXZ A6 FLEX +60 201
>Sam: BMOSSSU D12 M.BS +26 182
#note This is an awful play. I completely missed BIOME 12A, but SUQS is so obviously better and I have no idea why I didn't consider it, since I considered SUQ (which is also way better). 
>Jason_Idalski: CEHLPTZ 15D .CHLEP +39 240
#note SPELTZ scores a bunch more and keeps the nice CH, though I did hold SCHLEP.

>Jason_Idalski: AEIIKRV K8 VAKI. +24 381
#note AIVER 3J is simming better here. VAKIL looks pretty good, though. Not in the mood to look at it for too much longer.
>Sam: AGLNORS 3J ARGOL +23 301
#note This is a tough situation. Champ Player's favorite is ANGLO 4H, which is tougher to block completely, but I'm down by so much that a comeback seems unlikely.
>Jason_Idalski: AEGIRRU 8K .IRGA +30 411
#note Great play!
>Sam: AAENORS 15L ANOA +25 326
#note AROSE O11 is probably better. 
>Jason_Idalski: ?AEHRUU L1 HU.ER +26 437
#note RUsH O1 scores some extra points.
