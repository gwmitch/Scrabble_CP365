#note At this point Sammy is down to 6 minutes, and I have about 8.  I don't like my chances here and am looking for wins.  The only play that wins any endgames is EAU i4, which wins with the A, which I didn't see (and the A is very unlikely)  I missed ADHERE, only seeing ASHLER and naively hoped that DUROC would win with an L or S draw.  I'm not sure Sammy would see ADHERE, given his next play.  I don't mind this option here, even though EAU wins more purely.  It's very likely  Sammy has the A here, and ADHERE is missable (especially if ASHLER is misable)
