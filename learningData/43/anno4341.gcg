>Jason: AIMNORU 8D MIAOU +20 20
#note Perhaps a slightly inferior leave to ONIUM, though I kind of like the psychological aspect of him thinking I have vowel-itis. Pass U is really interesting, never occurred to me. (-6)
>Max_Panitch: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 0
>Jason: ?EINRRT E5 RET.RINg +78 98
#note Yay!
>Max_Panitch: AEHIPRT 12E .RAPHITE +80 80
#note Boo!
>Jason: DHILOST H12 .ITH +27 125
#note Here's one potential game-losing play. Positively DOLTISH of me. (-52)
>Max_Panitch: EN 9D E.N +9 89
>Jason: BDLNOSS L7 BONDL.SS +62 187
#note Yay!
>Max_Panitch: AEGILNU M2 LINGUAE +75 164
#note Boo!
>Jason: ACGIJLQ L3 QI +37 224
>Max_Panitch: STUY 15E TUS.Y +11 175
>Jason: ACEGJLW K4 JAG +32 256
#note Max took so long to play TUSHY that I concede that I may have overthought this play. I liked the leave a little better than CEGL. Duck likes JAW or JEW in this spot. (-3)
>Max_Panitch: AEEPSVY I2 PEAVEYS +78 253
#note Max, how I supposed to win this game with you bingoing every other turn?
>Jason: CEIKLNW G11 W.KE. +30 286
#note Didn't know WELKIN (14A). Maybe I should've played WINCE at D1 or CLEW at D3 instead. (-8)
>Max_Panitch: GMOR H1 GORM +43 296
#note grrr...
>Jason: CFIILNO 14B FOCI +20 306
#note Dammit, I missed the F- hook to ERN. I kind of forgot that part of the board existed. FOLIC or FICIN, duh. (-19)
>Max_Panitch: T 9C T... +5 301
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: ILLNOUX 10B XI +27 333
#note Wanted to save the X for F6 plays, but now felt I needed it to block the opening he created. Giving Max the blank, Duck likes LU(L)L ... not sure why.
>Max_Panitch: AE K10 EA. +13 314
>Jason: CLLNORU 1D CLUN. +11 344
#note With IN unseen in addition to the blank, I thought an -ING bingo was more likely than something starting in S. Plus, I know the Z's in the bag and I want it. Maybe UNCLOG instead? Duck's first pick of COL at 13A seems silly. (-4)
>Max_Panitch: ?BENORT N8 sORBENT +72 386
#note So much for that "more likely to have an -ING bingo" theory.
>Jason: AELORVW J10 WA.VE +39 383
#note I was proud of this, but even though it's the valuation leader, Duck is less impressed. It likes VOW at 13A.
>Max_Panitch: ADDE O12 DEAD +33 419
>Jason: EFLOORZ D1 .LOZE +34 417
#note Grr... FOOL would've gone great there. Best.
>Max_Panitch: ADIO F5 AD +17 436
#note AID at 13A is his best play, but he had me mistracked with no time to fix it. Thought I might've had REF or something.
>Jason: FOR 3B RO.F +14 431
#note My 17-point out wins by two. Had plenty of time pre-CLOZE ... didn't see it. Board vision fail. (shakes head)
>Jason:  (IO) +4 435
