#note HARL 11G is simming best by far. I wasn't 100% sure HARL was good, so I didn't try it. I liked LOX because it takes away all the parallel plays he could have had with the X, and is a decent fish. HARL is a risky play, but Quackle thinks it is by far best. I wish I had played it--if he doesn't have an S I get to bingo for 100 or so, and even if he uses it I have the VAC and HOY hooks.

#note I actually wrote DIGAmOUS down on my scoresheet! but I didn't know it, so decided to play it safe here. One day...

#note The four choices I wrote down during the game were WIRIER, MOIRE, MOWER, and WORMIER. Probably should have sacrificed points to keep a better leave.

#note EAU is clearly the play here, especially given that he just played VeT. Weak, and it cost me.
