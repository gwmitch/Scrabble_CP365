#note This was a pretty rough decision.  I didn't really like it much, but I thought it was better than 50-50 to be good, since it could be good even if OVERSPED* is phoney.  However, if challenged off and I go with the Y/DEV sequence, my chances aren't too good either.  It's more of a spread decision, and less of a "must challenge to win" decision.  My equity is in money at this point, since no one really gives a flying $@#&* who finishes 5th.  (-20)
