#note Q prefers the I8 placement. Meh.

#note Thought it looked familiar and gave it a go. Bob challenged pretty quickly, raising doubts.

#note It's good!

#note How many bingos did I miss? Let me count the ways. . . 1, 2, 3.

#note Another missed bingo. At least this one's a tough find. Second best is a nice 2x2 for 32.
>Bob_Linn: ?CEIMTV E5 V.M +16 157
#note Bob told me after the game that I blocked a big 2x2 bingo of VICOMTES. Not sure what letter the blank in his rack would have represented. Of course, playing the bingo last turn also would have accomplished that.

#note This is the third game I'm quackling from the tournament, and my fifth or sixth missed bingo. Have I mentioned that I suck, yet? Maybe now people will start to believe me.

#note I was aware the Q was a big factor here, and that he was likely to have it.
>Bob_Linn: P J9 P... +10 366
#note While I was pretty sure he had the monster before, I'm positive of it now.
>Steve: AEO 9H .O. +8 360
#note Don't have my exact rack, but it's mandatory to block.
>Bob_Linn: DEILNQ C2 LEND +13 379
#note Another set up. I'm under 30 seconds on my clock, but realize I just have to keep blocking for the win.
>Steve: AEEGSUX D2 AXE +35 395
#note Surprised to find the X as the last tile in the bag. Somehow find the 'best' play.
>Bob_Linn: INQ 2C ..IN +6 385
#note Seeing Bob play off everything except the Q gave me false confidence that there was nothing left to fear.
>Steve: EGSU F1 E. +2 397
#note I originally put down the G at 13L and said "Five." Bob then immediately slapped down the Q at 1E and said "11 and out." Since I had never hit the clock I was able to take back my play and make the obvious block, although blocking with the U is superior.
