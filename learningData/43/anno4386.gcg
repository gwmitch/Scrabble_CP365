>Jason: AEELNRU -EU +0 0
#note One of those "play short or long?" opening racks I love to discuss. FWIW, Duck's clear favorite was an option I considered: pass U. (-3)
>Lisa_Odom: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>Jason: AELNRRR -RR +0 0
#note The RR draw perhaps proves that I should've passed just U on the opening rack.
>Lisa_Odom: EILTUUU -UUU +0 0
#note I think this was Lisa's exact rack.
>Jason: AEEILNR 8C ALIENER +66 66
#note Yay!
>Lisa_Odom: AEIILTT I4 LITE.ATI +60 60
#note Boo!
>Jason: EIPQRTZ 7C ZEP +51 117
#note Yay! Surprised PRIZE, H11, is simming so much better. (-2)

#note As I took Sherrie through the big plays and showed her this, Adam Logan asked if MANDATE played at 12I. "No, LITERATI was on the board," I said. And that, boys and girls, is how I learned LITERATIM. (-11)
>Lisa_Odom: ACENOOR 12A CORONAE +83 202
#note Nice.
>Jason: DGNORST F4 GORS. +23 314
#note Correctly passing on GORS(E)D*, but that's about all Duck likes about this play. Considered a play like DOG or GOD at L7, but there's too few vowels to draw to. Duck likes TROD, L4. (-8)
>Lisa_Odom: OWY A12 .OWY +36 238
>Jason: DEHINST B9 .H +13 327
#note Stupidly didn't think to add the S. Get a high-prob six-tile stem in front of me and I sometimes forget to think. (-12)
>Lisa_Odom: AIJL L2 JAIL +24 262
>Jason: BDEINST 5E B. +8 335
#note Adventures in fishing, take two. Duck likes JIB, which I think is way too ballsy. (-)
>Lisa_Odom: GU J9 GU. +15 277
>Jason: DDEINST M5 DISTEND +65 400
#note Why can't all my games be this easy?
>Lisa_Odom: IP 8M .IP +15 292
>Jason: ADEOVWY M1 VOW +37 437
#note Can't complain about the four post-bingo draws, that's for sure.
>Lisa_Odom: ?CEEIKR O8 .ICKEERs +98 390
#note Held and released.
>Jason: AAADEXY N2 YEA +44 481
>Lisa_Odom: FFILNSS A5 .....S +18 408
#note Lisa fished for the E for SNIFFLE(s) for 101, not seeing they were all gone. (Counted as 19.)
>Jason: AADOOUX B12 .XO +39 520
>Lisa_Odom: FFILNNS 6M .FF +17 425
#note CP says LINN(s).
>Jason: AADOUV 10F AD +13 533
#note VAU(s) is four better.
>Lisa_Odom: ILNNS O1 IS +20 445
#note CP says LINN(s) is still best, by seven.
>Jason: AOUV 15L VAU. +10 543
#note Not seeing (PI)U and U(s), I thought OVA at L12 U-stuck myself. Nine-point error.
>Lisa_Odom: LNN 7I .L.N. +5 450
