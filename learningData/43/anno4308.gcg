>Steve: CDGNRTT -DGNRT +0 96
#note Duck likes playing on, thru the I at J7 with TING or TINCT. Of the exchanges, it prefers keeping DN.

>Paul_Epstein: IQ C9 QI +44 199
#note Scores and sets up a hot spot.
>Steve: EINNRT 10C ..N +3 254
#note Not sure of my seventh tile here, but I'm pretty sure I overlooked either TINNIER or INTERNE here. I was too intent on blocking a big vertical play starting at B10. Big mistake.
>Paul_Epstein: EFY 14H FEY +45 244
#note Ouch. 
>Steve: EIINRTT 15F RITE +33 287
#note Boy, do I suck. NITRITE for 95!
>Paul_Epstein: AA -AA +0 244
#note I can tell Paul is getting frustrated at the lack of bingo lines. Actually, anybody could - his tells are pretty obvious. He trades in two tiles.
>Steve: AEINOVX 14B OVINE +24 311
#note I liked this play because it burned tiles and set up the X. Q likes NOVA at E10.
>Paul_Epstein: P 6C P. +4 248
#note Nice set up, but at this point I realize that it's going to take more than one bingo to beat me. At least that's what I thought.
>Steve: AAEUVWX 15A AX +36 347
#note Q says I'm 94 percent to win after this play. It has no way of knowing I'm up against my daddy, however.
>Paul_Epstein: ?EMSSTU B2 MUTaSES +77 325
#note Only bingo. I didn't know it, and held. Looked like I could only lose by challenging, so I wisely held off.
>Steve: AAEOUVW A8 AVOW +36 383
#note Q correctly blocks the bingo line with the only play that guarantees the win. (Idalski suggested MAUVE, but this loses to ABULIAS).  I was down to two minutes on the clock. The available pool didn't look too promising. I thought AVOW would be enough.  (It is 97.22 percent of the time.) I was wrong. Again. 
>Paul_Epstein: AABGILS 2B .AILBAGS +69 394
#note Prompting my unsportsman-like 'Un-fucking believable' utterance at the table. My apologies to those who heard it. This one left a mark.
>Paul_Epstein:  (AETUU) +10 404
