#note Against Cree I want an open board; exactly what LACTATES doesn't achieve.  Even though Quackle seems to like LACTATES, I don't.  (-4)

#note I prefer WYE in hindsight.  Though I'm afraid of the L and the blank, there isn't much of a future playing HONEY, and there's no need to race.  There aren't a lot of bad things that can happen at line 2.

>Kenji: EFNQSUV O1 EF +24 290
#note I think I prefer EVEN.  I can't let Cree dick around with L?, create diversions on the right side of the board and then hit LAUREATE.  I need to take a stand now.  (-3)
>Cree: ?AILNOR B3 AILeRON +64 320
#note This is the type of play that makes me cringe.  Turns the game into a luckbox race to the J.  Could I have the J?  It's quite likely from his view...
>Kenji: AANQSUV A1 QUA +38 328
#note SUQ is light years better, even though I'm still sunk.  I need to give myself some chance at least. (-20)
