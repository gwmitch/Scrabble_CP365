>Pakorn_Nemitrmansuk: AAG 8H AGA +8 8
>Sam: FLORTVW 9G FLOW +26 26
#note Here I make a bizarre mistake. I think I convinced myself that keeping the R for AGA was over-important, and that RTV was better than FLT. I completely overlooked VROW's defensive value. After VROW, Pakorn's next play fits on top, but for 8 fewer points.
>Pakorn_Nemitrmansuk: ACLX 10F CALX +38 46
>Sam: GLMNRTV -GLMTV +0 26
#note I again overrated the importance of keeping hook letters. Quackle calmly explains that I am an idiot and should have just kept the best leave, RT.
>Pakorn_Nemitrmansuk: DEHINOS K2 HOIDENS +77 123
#note Even though Pakorn played this game slowly, as he always does, he laid this bingo down like someone had just lit a fire under his ass.
>Sam: ENORRTW 2J W.ORT +38 64
#note He held this for a while.
>Pakorn_Nemitrmansuk: AEHY 1L YEAH +55 178
>Sam: ?DENORT 4H RaT.ONED +72 136
#note Looked for a better bingo for a while, but there weren't any available.
>Pakorn_Nemitrmansuk: KZ 6J Z.K +36 214
>Sam: ADEIIJT 5E JADE +26 162
#note I'm not sure about this play at all. Maybe FAJITA, opening up the bottom half? That seems like it's too easy for him to shut down, though. DIDIE, opening up a new quadrant while giving me a good shot to hit a J play to the 1H TWS? JADE was the only play I really considered over the board.

#note I think taking the riskier bingo is justifiable. What do you think?

#note Champ Player likes DOG 13G, which is apparently fishing for APPOSITE as a triple-triple? Interested in hearing alternatives to my play. I wanted the IN for SPADING/SPAR, and almost got there with the IIN in the bag, but I left the N for him.
