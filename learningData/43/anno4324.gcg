>Kenji: EEFLNTV 8D FLEET +24 24
#note This is just a sign of what's to come.  I see EVENT, as well as the EVENTFUL extension, but decide FLEET is better because it scores 24 points.  I think my brain went on vacation this game, which is unfortunate and untimely.
>BenWithers: FINR 7G FIRN +23 23
>Kenji: DNORSVV -NVV +0 24
#note For some reason I thought DORS was a better leave here because of the open N and the NR antisynergy.  Quackle thinks I'm out of my mind.
>BenWithers: ADLNOTU E7 G.ITZ +30 53
>Kenji: DOORSTY 12B DORY +35 59
#note Of course if I keep NORS, I have NONSTORY.  At least I got one play right this game.

#note Just completely airballed on AUXIN.  (-7)
>BenWithers: LO N2 LO. +20 144
>Kenji: AAINRST 9G TSARINA +70 173
#note Correct, but 14b would have worked out much better.

>Kenji: CEEHMRT L12 HM +31 250
#note Laughably bad.  At least 5 better plays exist.  Probably one of the worst plays of my entire Scrabble career.  (-16)

#note I can't win with a bingo.  And while this is true, umm... I can't win playing this either.  PE is at least logical.  This.... isn't.  (-8)
