#note Quackle prefers OY, but I don't much like it.  ORATE seems reasonable, but I like my play.

#note The odds of me bingoing next turn are relatively low, especially if Jim blocks next turn, which he probably is going to do.  On the other hand, I won't necessarily win if I draw the Q, and ZEALS will play at b10 either way.  It's a pretty close decision, especially against this player, but I think that MU is slightly better.  However, this was a more than reasonable attempt (-3)

>Kenji: AEKOSUZ --  -75 273
#note Despite Quackle's estimation, my chances of winning with ZEALS here is very bad against Kramer.  Regardless, I obviously should've tried to win that way instead.  I thought that this had about a 10% chance of being valid, and that I had a fold equity of about 5%.  ZEALS wins about 8% of the time, in my estimation against Jim's possible holdings, and that includes his screwup equity.  Not a pretty spot.  Still, maybe I can hit OVERBORN or DUCKY and an outplay or something ridiculously lucky.  Spread: -79; Adjusted because of extra equity and taking into account thoughts, but still since the play was stupid: -19
