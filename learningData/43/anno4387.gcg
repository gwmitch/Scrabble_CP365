>Jim_Burlant: CGINOQT 8G QI +22 22
#note Obvious choice.  Get rid of the Q, and if he doesn't have an I, S, or an 8 with the i, he isn't going to score.
>Steve_Bush: ABO 7H ABO +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: CEEGNOT 6J GONE +16 38
#note Quackle prefers GOO J6 for 8, leaving CEENT.  My choice sacrifices maybe 2% winning chances and not even one point of valuation.  I personally don't like sacrificing 8 points of score for such an iffy leave.
>Steve_Bush: AFLM 5H FLAM +30 40
>Jim_Burlant: CEEEILT 4D ELITE +18 56
#note Didn't see the L-column plays, which was a bad miss on my part.  This oversight made this position a tossup between 9E ELITE and my choice.  I felt it safer to not open the row 8 triple for easy plays.
>Steve_Bush: INW 9F WIN +22 62
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGKOY M3 CAG.Y +30 86
#note Blind to the L-column again.  Also missed CAKEY M3.  Surprisingly, this play sims only marginally weaker than CAKEY, not sure why I don't take more of a hit for it.
>Steve_Bush: ENTUW 3B UNWET +25 87
>Jim_Burlant: DEIKNOY I9 YOK +28 114
#note Thought 28 pts was good enough considering the DINE leave.  Was a little concerned about XI as a comeback, but that was the only downside I could see to this play.
>Steve_Bush: BINR B1 BR.IN +14 101
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEINU A4 AEDINE +29 143
#note Saw AEDINE and felt this was the play - 29 pts was enough to justify breaking the rack up and drawing 6 to a U.
>Steve_Bush: ?FIJLST -  +0 101
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEINU 1A A.A +15 158
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Should have played AA A1 20.
>Steve_Bush: JT 4L T.J +20 121
>Jim_Burlant: AEINOTU E6 AUNTIE +23 181
#note Slightly better at E6, but this was the right idea.  A good leave was pretty much unattainable, and with 23 pts for the taking, it was too much to sit there and try to fish.
>Steve_Bush: OR 11I .OR +14 135
>Jim_Burlant: DEFORUX L8 FOXED +48 229
#note Quackle agrees.
>Steve_Bush: ?DERSST 12C DESeRTS +84 219
>Jim_Burlant: ?GIORRU 3H RUG +11 240
#note Didn't like the C column plays and didn't see the H1 play.  Felt that I didn't want to have one triple line open that didn't have a countering triple available at this stage of the game.
>Steve_Bush: IM M9 MI +23 242
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIOPRV C7 PROVI.Ed +84 324
#note Best bingo.
>Steve_Bush: LS 10H S.L +13 255
>Jim_Burlant: ACHOPRV B13 HOP +23 347
#note 6D play would have been slick (not that I would have seen this), but my main concern was making sure he didn't have an easy 8 from the D sitting in row 14.  I'd rather cough up the 8 pts for the V if I have to to make sure that he can't pull a miracle bingo and win the game, especially if he bingos and I pull the Z.
>Steve_Bush: DEISZ N10 SIZED +46 301
>Jim_Burlant: ACEORTV 14G CAVORTE. +66 413
#note Luckbox!
