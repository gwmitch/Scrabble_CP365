#note Nice start for Maddy. I held the play, even tho I was 90 percent it was good. (It's ZEMINDAR that needs an N.)
>Steve: EENNNUX C8 .NNEXE +28 48
#note Duck likes 11E UNSEX. A three percent difference in win percentage, and a nine point difference in equity. 
>Maddy_Kamen: ILT D11 LIT +28 98
>Steve: KNOOUUZ H1 OUZO +52 100
#note I was so focused on the ugliness of the rack that I almost missed this play! Nothing else is even remotely close.

>Steve: EFHIPSV L2 P.EVISH +38 254
#note I was really happy with this play at the time, but the duck shows the errors of my ways: FEH for 50!
>Maddy_Kamen: ?AIILSU 2L .IU +10 197
#note Maddy shared this rack with me in the post game. She missed SILIqUAE at E1. A tough one to find.
>Steve: AABDFIM E7 B.DIM +30 284
#note It was this or HAAF at 8L. I chose this to take out the bingo line. Q likes HAAF.
>Maddy_Kamen: ?AEILSY M6 dIALYSE +70 267
#note There's two bingos on row 15 worth 92; YEArLIES at 5a scores 84, but slots the Y in the triple lane.
>Steve: AABEFQY K10 EF +36 320
#note Transposing the E under the F scores an extra point and takes out the hot spot at L12.
>Maddy_Kamen: ADERV 14J DRAVE +39 306
#note This play gave me cause for consternation. Not only did it score well, but it also had me wondering what hooks it took on the back end. (Nada, it turns out.)
>Steve: AABCNQY 4D BAN.. +28 348
#note I'm more concerned with taking out a bingo line than I am in dumping the Q, especially with two I's still open.
>Maddy_Kamen: TTT -TTT +0 306
#note Maddy exchanged three tiles.
>Steve: ACDNQRY 8K C..RY +39 387
>Maddy_Kamen: ?CELORT 1C COLEw.RT +60 366
#note Nice find. One other bingo through the Y in column O available.
>Steve: AADNOQT 5C QAT +32 419
#note Quackle, in all its wisdom, plays OD at 14b. I started to play QANAT at 5a before spotting how many points I would be giving back. Should have seen the possibility to play it at 3a, but didn't.
