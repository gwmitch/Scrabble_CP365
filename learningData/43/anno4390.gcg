>Jim_Burlant: CILNRVX -CLRV +0 0
#note Took a while to decide on what to do here.  Saw any of the X plays and felt that the leaves were utterly hopeless.  Saw VIRL and felt that for 14 pts it really wasn't worth it to leave myself CNX.
>Ann_Hay: PTUZ 8G PUTZ +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: INORSWX J6 WI. +23 23
#note Her open immediately made me regret my decision to have exchanged.  Felt it more important to get rid of the W than cash the X.  Quackle felt XI 7H was the best play here.

#note Interesting position for opponent.  Opponent opted for the bingo; this sims virtually neck and neck  with (J)IBE 1L 39.   (winning percentage of bingo:  62.7%; JIBE 62.3%.  Valuation of bingo:  37.0.  JIBE:  37.2.)  In other words, AER? is such a potent that it's worth trading the 41 pts to shut down the hotspot.

>Jim_Burlant: AACOOSS 9E OCA +11 152
#note Starting to look bleak here.  Didn't see SOFA 3F. felt that all I could do was balance the rack.
>Ann_Hay: IO 1N OI +9 199
>Jim_Burlant: AOORSSS -SSOO +0 152
#note Didn't consider burning 2 S's for only 20 pts.  Game was starting to slip away from me here.
>Ann_Hay: INPY 10B PYIN +17 216
>Jim_Burlant: AEKMNRS 8A MARKS +51 203
#note Looked intently for an I to play through but there was none.  Almost played MONK E8 but then I saw this.
>Ann_Hay: ACEEGOT -ACE +0 216
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNOT 10G LENTOID +65 268
#note Caught a huge break.  Exchange went well and this was obviously a terrific draw.
>Ann_Hay: GO K9 G.O +8 224
>Jim_Burlant: AADOTTU 3B TAUT +11 279
#note Terrible draw.  Didn't remember DAUT,  and couldn't find a play that blocked the lines she created on row 12.  
>Ann_Hay: AAENRTV 12F TAVERNA +83 307
#note Very nice find.
>Jim_Burlant: DIINORS H12 .OID +24 303
#note So much for being in the lead.  
>Ann_Hay: EO G14 OE +7 314
>Jim_Burlant: AINOQRS 4A QI +23 326
#note Felt that I was 2 good tiles away from a bingo that would clinch the game.
>Ann_Hay: AEMT 5B TAME +15 329
>Jim_Burlant: ADLNORS N10 SOLAR +25 351
#note Saw several homeless 8's (LADRONES, ORDINALS, GOLDARNS) but didn't know there were 7's in this rack.   Since I thought I was dead bingo-wise and since there were still 2 S's and a blank at large, I felt that my only chance was to shut down the one remaining line and take my chances in the end game.  Wasn't sure about the wisdom of this choice but this turns out to be the best non-bingo option.
>Ann_Hay: GHNU 6C HUNG +23 352
>Jim_Burlant: CDEHINS O11 HIDES +43 394
#note Didn't know the bingo in this rack, and didn't know the 15A play.  Still an awesome draw from the bag, and this play pretty much nails her coffin shut.
