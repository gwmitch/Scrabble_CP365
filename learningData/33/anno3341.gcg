#note 2 seconds after I hit my clock I see the right move. Sigh. It also helps not to forfeit tempo and the fact that the letters on the board aren't -that-  conducive to helping me is important to consider. He also took time to think, which almost definitely tells me he has either the Q or X on his rack, which makes this an even worse choice.

#note aNODIC H10 suits my purposes much more.

#note Quackle favors fishing for a bingo here. I just thought well, he must have something sort of odd to play AM there since there's a bingo lane on the N-column, and one can play the AM for 21+ and a whole lot less playback off H12. Hence, I played to fish for a vowel that's not U - DHOW, CH-W, WHINED, etc... I personally like my move more because it gives me more of a chance to do stuff in the present. -if- I draw a vowel, that is...

>JL: BDEHMOW H1 DHOW +57 257
#note I really do wonder what he had with that TIS. Regardless, I'm pretty sure he played the wrong thing. Even IT H3 has to be better. As it is, I drew many options, and had he blocked that I would've had WHOMPED M3 40. Not 57, but still pretty good.

#note I thought BREEKS might've been good - I blame it on Cesar. He didn't practice enough with me. Punk. 
>Mike: CEGIITU M2 AA +14 257
>JL: EIIKLRS 9B KIR +11 347
#note LIVIER B9 makes -some- sense since it gives me an easy chance to play a K for 30+, and INK M11 is naturally Quackle's choice but I like trying to limit my opponent's chances. That being said, KIS N10 might've been a lot smarter for that one reason, though the playback is limited at the N9-N15 since I can block up row 14 or 15 a little easier than a bingo through the V (usually). Again, the AA was an impetus for me to play as I did. Stupid, probably.

>JL: EILLOSU G13 LEU +11 358
#note OUSEL N10 is favored and that makes sense since a J there is about as bad as a bingo there or usually through the N or T.

#note SOPH - again, I blame Cesar, since I had a feeling again.
