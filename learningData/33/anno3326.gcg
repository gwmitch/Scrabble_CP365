#note Told me his rack afterwards, because he wasn't sure of TWILLER*.
>Noah: EEIIISS M6 ISSEI +23 97
#note Yah, I hated this play, but didn't honestly like anything better. Quackle backs me up here.
>Carl_Johnson: AEGLRTU 7D TEGULAR +69 124
>Noah: ?DEIJPY E5 JE.P +26 123
#note Hoping to draw EN for next turn. Quackle likes PYE 9H best. It also wants me to play JEEP at 13K or 13J instead of here. What is the big difference? Is it afraid of opponent extension?
>Carl_Johnson: AX K11 AX +31 155
>Noah: ?DITYYZ N10 DITZY +52 175
#note Quackle prefers the fishy YIP. Meh. Would have turned out A LOT better than this in the end.

>Noah: ?EGIRST O1 RIGS +31 269
#note Didn't lie GITS, giving a less friendly bingo letter for next turn. I should have played EGIS though, following those lines. Quackle likes GITS best.

>Noah: ?BEGTUU -BGUU +0 269
#note What I get for missing RETINOl. Quackle likes CUBE, GIB, and GUAR all better than this. Maybe GIB, but I HAVE to bingo to win. I really need a great leave.
>Carl_Johnson: DIPU 1H PUDI. +30 387
>Noah: ?ADEMNT 2D MaNDATE +74 343
#note Quackle says DE N6 wins almost 40% of the time. What if opponent blocks though?
>Carl_Johnson: AEFGNOQ 2N Q. +22 409
>Noah: BEUU D1 U. +5 348
#note Trying to block what I thought was his high scoring play. If I knew what his high scoring play actually was, BREE is better. This is worse by 4.
