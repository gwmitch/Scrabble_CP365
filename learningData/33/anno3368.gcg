#note A pretty colossal error.  My thought was that AfREETS is the only play that leaves spots for the Z and C and doesn't leave AZANS or Z plays like TESSERA.  I also thought that a U draw ties after REpEATS but wins after AfREETS, but I missed PREZ completely.  Missing PREZ was basically what made AFREETS a bad play: I thought that ACE and the U both outran whatever Quackle would play.
