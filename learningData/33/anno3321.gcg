#note DHOTI scores more; this is safer.  Missed HIND(M)OST, though.

#note Best, surprisingly.

#note Damn, he blocked OU(T)LIVER.  He took a long time, said he wasn't sure about ELECTOR.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEILORU 13I OURIE +15 241
#note I took a long time here.  Didn't want to play AUREI/URAEI, opening up on top left.  OCULI and CURIO are out because they expose too much given the blank and Z are out.  So, I settled on this.  Quackle sure doesn't like it, but I do.  It kills his S hook and creates a phony one.  Key when playing a lower-rated player who may or may not know that.  Now, bingo possibilities on this board are next to none (save a miracle like CINEAST(E)) and I can continue to keep it close and outscore him while he tries to bingo.
>Sandeep_Bala: NU 2L NU +11 248
>Ryan_Fischer: AAGGILN 15A LA +10 251
#note Ew*.  Didn't see anything I like.  Quackle favors fishing which is stupid when there's nowhere to bingo, so I just took the most points I could find without giving anything back.
