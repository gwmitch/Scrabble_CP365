>Pete: DEIORSU K8 .OUD +10 10
#note A bunch of options are reasonable here.  I wisely decided against SOILURE, but should have gone for YOU or YO.  OUD is a bit aggressive, LOUD seemed reasonable enough
>Alex_Fiszbein: ADER L4 DEAR. +18 44
>Pete: DEHIORS 7F RHO +21 31
#note Missed bingo #4 for the tourney.  Did not see the bingo through the D... frankly, didn't look for it.  Laziness costs me.  OH or HO is better in other places.  
>Alex_Fiszbein: AOT K4 OAT +15 59
>Pete: DDEINST 3E DISTEND +66 97
#note Alex's last play seemed a bit of a fishing play, so I decided to pass on the points, and play up top.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEEHRST 9A REHEATS +72 131
>Pete: EENOPPR A4 PROPE. +39 136
#note This rack was so frustrating.  I saw the seven and the eight to an I.  When I saw him bingoing, I was praying for an I... darn.  PREOP 2B woulda been cool... and it's a new 5 for me.   the parallel play OPEN wins sim.
>Alex_Fiszbein: UX 2F XU +52 183
>Pete: CEEGMNO J10 MEG +25 161
#note HEGEMON wins sim.  MEG second, just ahead of GENOME and CHEGOE.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEGINRW 13H WEARING +81 264
#note and as I open, he uses. sheesh.
>Pete: ACEKMNO 1G MOCK +41 202
#note best.
>Alex_Fiszbein: IZ H13 .IZ +45 309
>Pete: AEEINTV N9 AVEN.E +36 238
#note Hated this play when I made it.  Duck says it and VENGE are abot even at the top... either one just under 4% to win.   
>Alex_Fiszbein: JNU O7 JUN +32 341
>Pete: GINOTTW M11 WI.O +16 254
#note Just a tilt.frustration play here.  Missed WITE for 34
>Alex_Fiszbein: BELV D8 B.VEL +26 367
>Pete: ABCGNOT 12L B..T +22 276
#note Now, I realize my only chance at respecatbility requires a Q play, most likely on the B column.  There is no play that has more than infinitessimal winning chances here.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AY B6 YA +30 397
>Pete: ACEFGNO E11 FAG +26 302
#note Nothing any good.  Pass up the big points for FAVE (or FOVEA, which I didn't see), to keep the miracle spot open.
>Alex_Fiszbein: FI 15F FI. +15 412
>Pete: CEELNOS 4C CLOSE +33 335
#note At this point, I just wanted to cut spread, while holding out hope for the miracle.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AT 10B TA. +17 429
#note Alex doesn't like miracles.  well blocked, I'm toast.
>Pete: ?EINQST 14G Q.S +25 360
#note QIS here sims best.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ?ILNOU 14A LOINs +15 444
