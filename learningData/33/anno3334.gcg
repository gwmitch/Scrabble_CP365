#note There are very few options after a horrendous draw. G9 (C)RUOR 8 gets rid of two of the four Rs, the paltry 8 points aren't enough for me to keep IRR. So, assuming an exchange, we know we should keep one of the four Rs, but what about a vowel alongside the R? It's a close call, but I like the safety net that having at least one vowel provides, and with three Is already on the board this early, IR is a little better than OR. In the computer simulation. keeping [R], [IR], and [OR] are all very close in that order.

>moh: AEEFIRT F3 FETERI.A +65 91
#note FETERITA is the only bingo and easily the best play.

>moh: ACDEORV 8A COVE +33 124
#note Opp blocked CAVOR(T)ED. Since there's no other bingo, the play has to be at 8A (e.g., COVE, CAVE, CODA, ARVO, DEVA). COVE maximizes score in that spot and its leave is a little better than CAVE's leave.

>moh: ?ADEIRU A6 DE.URIAl +61 185
#note The actual bingos were N8 REsIDUA and A7 A(C)qUIRED. Sadly, I missed both of them, so I settled for the intentional phony A6 DE(C)URIAL*. I thought it plausible enough to get by. 
>glenda: OTW 7K TOW +15 186
>moh: ABEEGKR M9 B.EAK +28 213
#note I seriously considered 6L BAKE 31, but hated opening up the triple line so gratuitously. M9 B(L)EAK 28 is a better play, and I'm glad I didn't settle for BAKE.
>glenda: FOSY H1 FOYS +45 231
>moh: AEGNOOR N2 OREGANO +77 290
#note OREGANO is the only bingo.
>glenda: AJ G2 JA. +30 261
>moh: GMTUWYZ O8 YUM +39 329
#note Seriously bad miss! O8 YUTZ 63 goes a long way towards sealing this game. Instead I settled for YUM in the same spot.
>glenda: AILN 5K ALI.N +12 273
>moh: EGOSTWZ 12L G.ZE +30 359
#note 11C WOGS 28 is the sim winner, but I think I prefer to score a little more, keep my S, and leave the triple lane inaccessible to bingos. 12L G(A)ZE does all that.
>glenda: DIOST 11A .DIOTS +26 299
>moh: ELORSTW 12D WO +22 381
#note I saw TROWELS, and I was pretty sure that BLEAKS was good, but not 100% (in addition to the adjective, BLEAK can be a freshwater fish, so says the Book). Sad, I know. But being up 60, I thought I would likely win if I just kept scoring, but a challenged phony could open the door for my opponent.
>glenda: ?DGNOTU 13E TONGUeD +63 362
#note Nicely done! TONGUeD is the only bingo.
>moh: ELNRRST 2G ..LTER +15 396
#note I didn't mind conceding QI on the triple since I'd easily win with an out-in-two. A block like 2J LENT(O) was a little better, though.
