#note In retrospect, this isn't such a smart move. Cesar likely has to have something that can make lots of 8s if he's not choosing to play TAX 7F 25. And of course, what usually makes 8s can probably make 7s. JIG J6 might be a smarter idea at this point in time. 
>Zar: ?EGORRS H8 .GnORERS +77 101
>Zames: AABCDHN A7 BAND +33 142
#note Wow, I really suck. How I missed CHAD is beyond me.

>Zar: ?AENRSY 15A gRAYNES. +92 200
>Zames: AEEFGIL 12A FEAL +29 203
#note I sort of liked FLAG more for the points and considered FEEL (which is slightly favored but still within a statistical noise range, I think), but decided to try and hold onto a sort of balanced rack. 
>Zar: BCO B6 COB +21 221
#note Such an open board. And Cesar was thought Kate was mean for playing closed on him? 
>Zames: EGIKTVY K11 IVY +22 225
#note KInGLY 10F. 
>Zar: AFRR F6 FR.AR +29 250
>Zames: EEGIKLT E3 KITE +21 246
#note It's funny how hindsight kicks you. FEEL 12A and the same chain of moves would've led to TAGLIKE/GLAIKET this turn. However, even so, my move here isn't great. TYKE 13J is most favored. I did want more potential volatility, though, and some places to play through (however wrong that idea might be given an unseen Q). ERG 14G is also a potential move to consider. 
>Zar: IIW 3E .IWI +15 265
#note Cesar said his last letters included a U and some other things, and that he had a ~25 point move that would've left IIU or IUU but nowhere near as much volatility. I'm left thinking that move, or exchanging, are a lot more useful to him than this at this point. 
>Zames: AEGIILO H1 AG.O +18 264
#note I had a feeling VOGIE or VIGIA were better moves but I couldn't bring myself to play them. VOGIE makes sense given the insane number of Es left, and I can infer his last rack had no Q nor Z (since WIZ would be at least my choice before KIWI). This was the wrong move I think. 
>Zar: DEV 4D V.DE. +26 291
>Zames: EEEIILS 14G I.E +9 273
#note I saw EERIE 14F 2 seconds after hitting my clock. However, Cesar was starting to run low on time. 
>Zar: ANU 9J .NAU +5 296
#note I -really- wonder what he had here. it's an interesting move with some interesting rationales (particularly since I am quite blatantly fishing) but I am not sure if he picked the right move. 
>Zames: EEHILSZ L8 H.ZE +23 296
#note ECHE 12F! I didn't mind my move all that much though because it made the lane hard to close unless he had an M, which he likely didn't the last turn or he'd have played VUM 12K. 
>Zar: EMNU M11 NEUM +16 312
#note Great play considering he was expecting me to bingo. 
>Zames: EEILMST 1F ME.LIEST +61 357
#note Wow, I really suck and completely missed ELMIEST, which would be more useful, not least because it would make a Q much more likely to play (QI 7M or an easier draw for QAID F1 or QAT 1G). 
>Zar: EPTW 15L WEPT +46 358
>Zames: AEOOQRT M1 .OOTER +12 369
#note Cesar had 90 seconds left on his clock. I track and think he has TOEA for some reason even though I write down clearly ADOT on some other part of my paper. Because I thought he had TOEA I tried to block up STOAE. I really, really, deserved to lose this game. 
>Zar: ADOT 5J OAT.D +12 370
>Zar: ADOT --  -12 358
#note 85 or so seconds goes by, Cesar plunks -this- down, and I'm firstly in shock that I mistracked so badly, and secondly amazed that I got a free win that I kept trying to give away. Go me...? 
>Zames: AQ 4K QA. +24 393
>Zames:  (ADOT) +10 403
#note So, as you can see, I do not deserve to win Scrabble games.
