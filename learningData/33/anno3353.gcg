>JL: ABDEHIN 11E BAI.H +20 72
#note I think AH 6E plays a little better, though I like the leave after BAITH, and that it opens up a few more lanes. However, HABIT 11D is also worth considering.

#note Nothing ventured, nothing gained was my idea with this, though in all fairness PINGS M3 makes a whole lot more sense.

>JL: EGORSXY 14B GOX +38 242
#note GOY 5E is an interesting idea - basically, the premise is that I'll likely get to use my X next turn for 30+ anyway. I did like leaving more bingo lanes open, though.

#note I had somewhat of a problem here - YERK 5B sounded quite attractive since I had the case U, though there is the chance of QAID/QADI coming down. Plus, it makes it harder to play an F play from 2J (though there is still the problem of one from 5E). 48, though, is still 48.  
>Mark: IL B10 LI. +5 374
>JL: DEIKRTV 5B DIRK +32 436
#note Well. I think I can see the hope of INK G11 (ie, traw a bingo) which seems to be a much more favorable odd than blocking up two lanes with DIRK. I was considering IRK 5C but tried to calculate out not drawing a bingo and having Mark bingo from A4, where I would then definitely lose. In the end, I just put this down hoping something would turn out right. And it seems someone up there really likes me, because Mark had absolutely nothing. He actually drew the blank after LIT. I guess INK makes sense because I would draw bingos with AEO? (or 5/11 of what's leftover, plus residual chances to win if he didn't draw a bingo either), though the bingo with the A is very unlikely to be played if he bingos where I expect him to.

#note Wow - REVOTE here would've been the 5 to tie Sam on its own. I have to play things better than this.
