#note TAB probably better by a little bit.  The E might be worth a lot more than it looks, and the G isn't likely to help me.

#note Thematically this is correct, but there actually still is some play left.  There is not a lot of long term volatility, but enough to make bingoing correct by a little.  You're an underdog but taking 41 and then bingoing, if that occurs doesn't help you enough to make it worth passing it up.  Also WITHIE? over WHITIE? by a large margin.

#note Fishing for AGGRIEVE/AGREEING and hoping.  Obviously a bad line, but it could work.  Eh, probably not.
