>Keith_Cejmer: II -II +0 0
#note Keith exchanges 2 tiles.

>Pete: CCIRRST -CR +0 0
#note Only two real choices, CRIT or exchange CR.  After Keith made the little exchange, my choice was easy.  CRIT wouldn't have been too bad though.
>Keith_Cejmer: FNORT H4 FRONT +24 24
>Pete: CIIRRST 5E CIR.I +14 14
#note Well, I missed.  CIRRI is best of a bad bunch.
>Keith_Cejmer: LOT 4F LO.T +13 37
>Pete: DEHLRST 6G T.LD +15 29
#note Right idea, but duck goes with L(OR)D for the better leave.
>Keith_Cejmer: AQ 8F QA. +12 49
>Pete: EHIRSUZ 4F ....IER +20 49
#note I hated this position.  The plays that score, either left awful or gave back huge replies.  Sim likes QUIZ by a bunch, although I hated leaving the Z next to the DLS.  LOFTIER was just lazy.  DUH is a good option here.
>Keith_Cejmer: EHW 5K HEW +30 79
>Pete: AHNSTUZ 3J THAN +28 77
#note I got a bit too defensive here, afraid to open the triple lines.  HAUNT N2 makes far more sense.
>Keith_Cejmer: ENO N3 EON +21 100
#note I just have a bad feeling about this...
>Pete: GKSUVXZ -GKUVZ +0 77
#note How come when my opponent makes a blatant, obvious setup, I have no reasonable way to do anything about it.  I keep SX, because I was sick of the Z on a Z unfriendly board.  Sim says all four reasonable options (keep S, keep SZ, keep SX and keep SXZ), are closely packed as best.
>Keith_Cejmer: COSY O1 COSY +57 157
#note Sheesh.

>Pete: AAENOSX M5 .AX +21 98
#note Miss the cool SEAFRONT extension, which is slightly superior.  WAX is second best, and opens a line on a tight board.  
>Keith_Cejmer: J 2N J. +40 197
>Pete: AENOOSW 9G ASWOON +26 124
#note I intentionally turned down the l7 placement.  I just wish I remembered why...  Duck fishes with OW.  I just wnated to start over with the rack at this point.
>Keith_Cejmer: AEIPT 10J PIETA +29 226
>Pete: EEFIRVZ 7K VE. +13 137
#note My big miss of the game.  I hate Z sixes.
>Keith_Cejmer: EIV 11H VIE +11 237
>Pete: AEFIORZ H11 .IZOR +54 191
#note But I get bailed out here.  For the first time, I felt like I was participating in this game.
>Keith_Cejmer: ?EENPRU 15H .EPUgNER +77 314
>Keith_Cejmer: ?EENPRU --  -77 237
#note A phoney this obnoxious, I almost take as a sign of disrespect.  Buh Bye.
>Pete: AAEEFKS O6 FAKES +44 235
#note He misses the two bingoes in that rack.  So do I, but I'm taking the points here.  
>Keith_Cejmer: ?EENPRU 13E PRE. +16 253
>Pete: ABEISTU 15H .UB +5 240
#note OK, here's the thought.  He's gonna be bingoing soon with his rack.  The key is to make him bingo for a little and give me back a lot.  RUB takes out the most dangerous line... his likely bingoes open the the A column, while I'm drawing at AEIST.  Seemed like the best chance I had.  I puts my game on the line with hitting my shot, but it also forces him to catch still.  Duck likes TUBAE and URB f12 better, which I don't get (I simmed specifying ENU? on KEith's rack.). I welcome any thoughts.
>Keith_Cejmer: ??EEINU 10A EqUINEs +59 312
#note The only bingo.  You couldn't have payed me to play it in this situation.  Duck's NUdIE wins sim, and number of other plays best EqUINEs.  
>Pete: AEGISTU A7 AGU. +15 255
#note So of course, I catch GU.  This game is the perfect representation of so much of what's to come this tourney.  AGUE is best, and has some mathematical winning chances, but I know game's over.
>Keith_Cejmer: BDMO C9 D.MBO +24 336
>Pete: EEIMSTU 11E UM +16 271
#note He seems committed to giving me a chance.  Of course, the bag is just as committed to bending me over.  My play was tilt and anger setting in. NEUME l9 somehow wins 23%, and TUBE 21%... don't see it, but whatev.
>Keith_Cejmer: AGY B5 GAY +14 350
>Pete: DEEIRST 12J DIETER +23 294
#note great, so now I get the bingo rack.  I'm very short on time here, and play the first thing I see that goes out. DITSIER 12G ends up one point better net.
>Keith_Cejmer: ADGILLN 14J ALIGN +22 372
>Pete: S C9 .....S +11 305
#note and now, I'm 3-3.  ugh.
>Pete:  (DL) +6 311
