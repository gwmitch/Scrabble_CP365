>Cesar: AEGLNOR 8G LOG +8 8
#note i didn't even consider how strong AEGLNR was. yuck. when i told james this rack he immediately told me -O. this is one of my poorest opening plays in memory... (-9) even ALONG is better. (mike perl was right)
>George: ?DILORU J7 DOUR +12 12
>Cesar: AADENRU G7 U.AN +6 14
#note i don't know what gets into me for these important games. i'm also surprised ADENRU is so strong, but playing 7I AD is right at the top, or 11J AA (totally whiffed on the back hook, even though i wrote ODOUR in huge letters on my scoresheet) (-6)
>George: JR 9F J.R +12 24
>Cesar: ADEPRST E6 PETARDS +81 95
#note so.. why is departs 0.5 pts better? :)  (-0.5)
>George: BITY 12B BIT.Y +20 44
>Cesar: ACEESTV C9 VAT.C +28 123
#note cavie is the star play here. i thought i was being clever and closing up the board. EST is just way too strong. (-11)
>George: ?LLOSTW 11I TaLLOWS +73 117
>Cesar: AEEEOSV O11 .OAVE +27 150
>George: DIOZ M9 ZO.ID +50 167
>Cesar: ?EEEFNS K1 dEFENSE +71 221
#note i noticed enserfed when i was looking at this game's scoresheet on the plane. i suck. my move doesn't have enough defense. (-3)
>George: AERY 1H REA.Y +33 200
>Cesar: HIKNPRS 4H HIK.R +32 253
#note again another move where playing a single tile is right!? someone explain to me how prinks is so strong. the E? J1 AH wins. (-4)
>George: ACIMNTU 15H MUCINAT. +89 289
#note i suck
>Cesar: DINPQRS I3 Q. +21 274
#note first of all, MUCINATE*. i let it go right away. it's what i always guess for that rack!!! second of all, QIS is better. i talked myself out of it, but it's better cesar.. how much equity do i lose for the phony, like 100? and the QIS equity: (-7)
>George: FI B10 FI. +31 320
>Cesar: ADINPRS 2J D.AIR +32 306
>George: AEGHIO F1 HOAGIE +20 340
>Cesar: ABENOPS O1 ASPEN +31 337
#note i don't understand.. i write BLAE down, i have the case S, and i make a nonsensical move. (-9)
>George: EEMNNOX G2 EX +36 376
#note no!
>Cesar: BILMNOU D2 LIMBO +23 360
#note i think i was trying to go out in 2, or something. according to championship player, NOTHING wins. H14 UM gives the best equity. (-2.4) anyone wanna try to win this endgame for me?

>George: EEOT C3 TE +12 400
>George: EEOT --  -12 388
#note !!!
>Cesar: W 5K ..W +6 378
#note i thought i was going to have another miraculous game like the 2nd one, but the recount only gave me an additional point and it wasn't enough. george was so upset before the recount.
>Cesar:  (EEOT) +8 386
