#note Is there a cool I-hook somewhere that I'm missing, because I have no clue why Q prefers keeping DEIS then ADEIS over ADES. I still like my play best, but am confused by this sim.

>Dave_Leifer: EINTU D3 UNITE. +12 230
#note This play confused me; 3 straight short, low-scoring dumps, then a 5-letter dump for 12 points?

#note I guess I was trying to set up my S hook for another bingo lane; I see nothing wrong with WED C7 though.

#note I liked this better than BLEND 14B for a few reasons. First, the ER are pretty much pointless to leave with that Q, unless I draw one of the Us (<10% chance) I'm certainly not bingoing. Secondly, it scores 4 more points. Thirdly, it gives me 2 more chances to draw one of those 6 Is (>20% chance) for something around 3C or a simply QI at 14A or 5C. BRAWLED sims very poorly, but I liked, and like, it a lot.

#note Nice blocking play
>Phil: AEFIQSU 15A QUI. +39 266
#note QUIT seems like a nobrainer* but there are 2 other viable options here. FE 7C is interesting; take 18 points and a 15% chance at drawing into SEQUOIA (which would be unblockable, as it plays at A1 and G1). I like it a lot, but it seems more of a desperation move than I needed; not worth sacrificing 21 points for this fish. The other option is simply adding the S onto QUIT, which also is interesting. On this board, I probably should've taken 13 points for that S; I think I like QUITS the best here, but it's close.
>Dave_Leifer: AIIOSUV C2 AVO +31 322
>Phil: AAEFIOS 9A OAF +27 293
#note The AIO draw didn't help my cause; in fact, Champ. likes Ex. AAFIO. I dislike this option, as he will probably block the A1 lane, leaving me with a measly 60-point bingo at G1 (if I can even draw into one) which he can easily win after. I guess OAF blocks one of my lanes for him, but I don't think exchanging can realistically win me this game.
