>Rod: GJMNPTT -GJNPTT +0 0
#note Kept the M, which is a decent tile, plus maybe Opp makes a false inference about the tile I'm keeping.
>Opp: ACEMR 8D CREAM +24 24
>Rod: HIMNOVY D8 .HIVY +32 32
#note Strongly considered HOMINY, decided I was better off sacking a couple of points to ditch the V.
>Opp: ?AEEINT H8 .ATINEEs +80 104
>Rod: AIMNOPS 10G P.OMAINS +70 102
>Opp: EFGN I9 G.NEF +33 137
>Rod: ENTTUUX J13 TUX +18 120
#note I wasn't thrilled about selling the X so cheap, but that was the thing to do here. Had to unduplicate and this isn't a good X board anyway... could become a liability if I don't move on.
>Opp: JY K9 J.Y +26 163
>Rod: EEINTUU -EUU +0 120
#note With lots of good consonants, particularly 2 naked S's, open to play through, I much prefer the exchange to any play here. Possible inference from JAY that Opp is close to bingoing, which only increases the urgency for me to do so ASAP.
>Opp: AEILOPR N4 POLARI.E +62 225
#note Good News - I've drawn an S. Bad News - Opp has bingoed again and I've drawn the Q (without a great spot for it.) This is an important turn, things could really get out of hand quickly here.
>Rod: EIKNQST 7M Q.T +22 142
#note Tough call, but QAT feels right. KERN scores a lot better, but I can't dance around with the Q being so far behind without an obvious place to score with it. With QAT, I'm already threatening SKEIN O11 and have flexibility. QAT also kills some of the volatility at 8L, which I actually like in this case. The lesser the chance Opp scores 40+ next turn, the better off I am.
>Opp: BRW F6 BR.W +15 240
>Rod: EHIKNST O11 THINK +50 192
#note This worked out better than planned. Score huge, keep ES. I'm still in business.
>Opp: ?EILRSU 15A LEISURe. +71 311
#note Could be back out of business now, as Opp bingos yet again. That handful of vowels didn't help either. This day does not appear to be getting off to a good start.
>Rod: AADEEES O3 SEDA.E +40 232
#note Tried like hell to not surrender the S, but it just scores too much to avoid. I gotta stay in range.
>Opp: IOV A12 VIO. +11 322
#note Okay, a bingo line or two go away, but I'm pleased as punch to see Opp score 11 points in the name of defense. But a look at my rack tells me I'm in gigantic trouble.
>Rod: AAAAEGI M9 A.GIA +21 253
#note Quackle says exchange, of course. I don't have time for that. This Opp has already shown the intent to plink away the bingo lines, but I still expect to be down 110+ by my next turn IF I exchange. A bingo may not be enough by then. Yes, I need to draw the S, but I also gotta stay on his radar. Time to test the waters...
>Opp: DLO G10 .LOD +25 347
#note It stays. Not even a hesitation or funny look from Opp.
>Rod: AAEGRTZ L12 TZAR +43 296
#note Sim likes ZAG. I can see the argument with the AERT leave, but I still prefer the additional 7 points and a greater chance of hitting the S I desperately need.
>Opp: CEFOTUW E7 O.E +14 361
#note It's decision time. That S isn't showing up, and I'm down a bingo. My best scoring options don't improve the board, don't get rid of enough bad tiles, and don't give me enough shots at the S. I gotta make something happen here.
>Rod: AEFGNOU M1 UNFOG +28 324
#note After ANGIA* didn't get even get a second glance, I'm emboldened. Hoping to distract Opp into jumping on the new opening, while I (hopefully) draw the S and bingo down the C column. I expect that Opp needs to be 100% sure in order to challenge, given the game situation. After all, there's a lead to protect.
>Opp: DI L3 ID +25 386
#note Darn, still no S. I'm toast... right?
>Rod: ABDERTW 1H DRAWT.BE +185 509
#note I can hear Al Michaels shouting all the way from Lake Placid. Yes Al, I do!
>Opp: CELNOSU -  +0 386
#note Opp had a playable bingo, but knew it wasn't enough. Challenging seems like the right decision.
>Rod: EO C12 OE +9 518
#note An utterly ridiculous game.
>Rod:  (CELNOSU) +18 536
