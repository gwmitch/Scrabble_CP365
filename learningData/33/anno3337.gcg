>moh: ?EEIKOT 9H TOElIKE +68 68
#note Perhaps pOET(L)IKE would bait some opponents to challenge, but challenge-baiting is a tricky game. I'll stick with the sim winner.
>glenda: FNO 10J FON +30 46
>moh: EHMNOTW 7C WHOM +29 97
#note Ugh! I missed a bingo pair--TOWNHOME/HOMETOWN. WHOM was the best non-bingo, but that's hardly consolation.
>glenda: AIV 10F VIA +17 63
>moh: EENNSTU 8N NE +8 105
#note There are no real scoring opportunities on this board. The top play is 10N NU 8, but all of the fish plays are pretty close.
>glenda: DGS L8 D..GS +18 81
>moh: DDENSTU 9B DUD +13 118
#note Another lame play, but--once again, there's nothing available. As lame as my DUD looks, it stands up well in the sim. Other options: D7 (HA)UNTED 22, L4 STUD(DINGS) 24, or the cool D4 UNS(HA)DED 26.
>glenda: IZ N6 ZI.. +33 114
>moh: EENSSTT E6 T..E +12 130
#note Now this is getting silly! Another turn and another lame, low-scoring play since TENSEST won't play. The sim winner, 11I ET, sets up a place to hook a bingo on my next turn, and that's probably the reason it wins the sim. The lesson? Great leaves don't mean much on a closed board.
>glenda: IT 8A TI +9 123
>moh: AENSSTV 12E VASTNES. +62 192
#note Finally (and luckily)!
>glenda: GRUU 7H GURU +11 134
>moh: EILOOTU 6L OU.O +13 205
#note E11 O(V)ULE 16 seems insane with a lead, so OUZO it is.
>glenda: ACW 5J CAW +21 155
>moh: EEIILPT 4L TIPI +26 231
#note The other option here is E3 EPI(TOME), but I don't really think it's that close--TIPI scores more and leave the board much tighter than EPITOME.
>glenda: X M3 X. +18 173
>moh: AAEEELN 6A LEA +10 241
#note With nowhere to score, why not kill the only comeback spot along column A? I'll take a 70-point lead on a bingo-dead board any day.
>glenda: EEEGJNQ O3 Q. +11 184
>moh: AEENRRT A1 RENTA. +21 262
#note What happened to the guy that was so obsessed with keeping a closed board?! Trust me, I didn't really like opening the board up, but all of my option opened something up (even the defensive-looking 5A ERN offers a bingo off of S(NAW)), so I figured I may as well score a little.
>glenda: EIR H12 .IRE +12 196
>moh: EILLPRY C3 PIL.. +20 282
#note 2A (E)ERILY is the best play, hands down. I didn't see it, though, and settled for the decent C3 PIL(AW)
>glenda: AJ 14F JA. +26 222
>moh: AEFGLRY D1 LEAF +30 312
#note This play puts me up 90 with a dwindling bag, and even though it opens up a triple, I'm only worried about bingos at this point, and the L offers less along row 1 than the R did before this play. 
>glenda: DINY 1D .INDY +27 249
#note Exactly the kind of play I like to see at this point. Tit-for-tat at this point is like trading pieces when you're up a rook in chess--bring it on!
>moh: BGNORRY 10N BY +35 347
#note Finally a B comes out for the hook at 10N. As much as I'd like to block possible bingos at 15H, I prefer to leave a tile in the bag, and the ZINE(B) hook offers plenty of points to justify it in my book.
>glenda: ?ABCEOS 15H .COBASEs +86 335
>glenda: ?ABCEOS --  -86 249
#note Creative :-).
>moh: GHNORRR 15E ROG.R +18 365
>glenda: ?ABCEOS J2 BOx.A. +17 266
>moh: EHNR I3 HE +19 384
#note Missed 3G HER(O)N and out (although I was low on time and didn't really look for an out play).
>glenda: CES 3C ..CES +10 276
