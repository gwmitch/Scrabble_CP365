>Pete: ABDESTY 8D BEADY +28 28
#note I trade points for not giving up the easy hotspot.  Duck likes BY.  
>Harriette_Lakernick: DDFLO E4 FOLD.D +22 22
>Pete: EIJPSTU D1 JUTE +48 76
#note I had a moment of doubt on JUPE, so I figured, why risk it?  take the 48 and move on.
>Harriette_Lakernick: IIIII -IIIII +0 22
#note Harriette exchanges 5.
>Pete: INOPSVX C2 XI +31 107
#note Duck takes JOINS... XI just seems to make more sense to me.   
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?BEEERR 7H BEERiER +67 89
>Pete: CNOPSUV 1D .UPON +42 149
#note The spot stayed open, and I keep some distance, even after her blank binko.
>Harriette_Lakernick: LMO 6B MOL. +12 101
>Pete: CEFGISV J6 V.G +15 164
#note I miss/don't know FIDGE at 9C... I go with the best leave I can, while killing the 2X2 line that I seem unlikely to have use for anytime soon.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?AINOOR 2H ORAtION +68 169
>Pete: CEEFIIS 7C FI. +25 189
#note Well, I survived two blank bingoes.  Just have to find a way from here.  FIE 3L is better.
>Harriette_Lakernick: GIT 1M GIT +17 186
>Pete: CEEIISU -EIU +0 189
#note the problem with FID last turn is that I invariably draw IU.  I pass on CURIE, miss UREIC, and exchange 3. UREIC is best. 
>Harriette_Lakernick: ANQT N6 T.ANQ +36 222
>Pete: CEISTVW 11I CIVETS +37 226
#note I am town between WIVES/VIEWS and CIVETS.  with 3 Ss unseen, I choose turnover and the slightly inferior leave.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EM O8 ME +26 248
>Pete: ADEEORW 3G OWED +22 248
#note OWE.  Save the consonant.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AINOT D6 ...ATION +23 271
>Pete: AAGIIRR C9 RIA +13 261
#note I'm trying to set up a play with SomethingR from B10.   Wins sim.
>Harriette_Lakernick: PUY 13B PU.Y +18 289
>Pete: AGINRSW G8 .RAWINGS +65 326
#note Only bingo. WRAPS, which I did briefly consider, actually sims very close.  
>Harriette_Lakernick: AEEL 15D LEA.E +18 307
>Pete: AACEHHZ 14A ZA +30 356
#note I am really proud of this play.  I had to gulp before I passed up the 67, but this way, I'm scoring minimum 60 in two plays, and possibly more, since she is in fish mode and needs to catch a bingo.  a (partial) block lets me close the board.  ZA for 67 puts me at risk is she bingoes immediately (unlikely but possible).  If she does, I come back for 56.  I liked this play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EIKNORU L9 KU. +7 314
>Pete: ACEHHOT 15A AH +56 412
#note I start working on my spread again.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EILNRSS 14G .RINLESS +74 388
>Harriette_Lakernick: EILNRSS --  -74 314
#note Desperation phoney goes off.
>Pete: CEHOT B9 OH +32 444
#note I screw up the nedgame, but it's academic. THY e11 or HOT F10 net 6 more.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EILNRSS 14G .RINS +10 324
>Pete: CET F1 .EC +20 464
#note best.  4-3, +1something, and looking forward to tomorrow... I'm in contention... for now.
