>AUGUSTINE: ?ALNRTY 8F RiANTLY +76 76
>JEREMY: COOQSTY -  +0 0
#note I've been studying 7s by probability and have 1-2500 in my cardbox. Figured I would have seen this if it was good. It's number 2588!
>AUGUSTINE: INUW J4 UNWI. +16 92
>JEREMY: COOQSTY G7 Q. +20 20
#note Was too focused on getting rid of Q and missed TYCOO(N)S 2x2 for 48.
>AUGUSTINE: EIOO K8 .OOIE +10 102
>JEREMY: CEOOSTY 9A COYOTES +81 101
>AUGUSTINE: BLO A6 BLO. +24 126
>JEREMY: AAINPRV B9 .VARIAN +36 137
#note NIRVA(N)A scored 4 more in that same 2x2 slot.
>AUGUSTINE: EILOPT 5E TOPLI.E +36 162
>JEREMY: DEEIMPS 13E IMPEDES +73 210
#note P(R)EMISED is the better bingo. I seem to keep picking the second best play.
>AUGUSTINE: AKRTU 4A KURTA +30 192
>JEREMY: AEEJRST H12 J.ER +57 267
>AUGUSTINE: AGILMNS 15F MA.LINGS +63 255
>JEREMY: ACESTVW A1 TAC. +30 297
#note I was only 95% sure of WAC(K), but got stuck in that corner and played TAC(K). Not a great play.
>AUGUSTINE: AEIU C3 U.AEI +12 267
>JEREMY: EEFNSVW 6E EF +29 326
>AUGUSTINE: HI A14 HI +26 293
>JEREMY: EGNRSVW 10J V.W +17 343
#note Totally missed the V(O)WER hot spot I had been watching earlier! Was just trying to get my leave in order for the endgame and block a bingo lane with ? still out.
>AUGUSTINE: BIZ 3E BIZ +30 323
#note This play will come back to haunt my opponent.
>JEREMY: AEGNRSU H1 UREA. +33 376
>AUGUSTINE: HOO 12D OOH +21 344
>JEREMY: DGGNNSX 1G D.NG +6 382
#note I figured D(U)NG would block the bingo lanes, and I wanted to empty the bag in case the ? was still in there. Quackle seems to agree when simulated.
>AUGUSTINE: ADF 10D FAD +26 370
#note He blocked the obvious 50+ X spot, hoping I would miss the other.
>JEREMY: ?EEGNSX 2D SaX +56 438
#note Nice final pull finishes it off.
