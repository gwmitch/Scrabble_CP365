#note Best, happily. :)  (Not worried about the hotspot 'cause that alone won't catch me (Z's gone), and opening with anything else is more dangerous.  So why NOT play 6 tiles, score 32, and keep the blank?

#note Aw, no place for TWIBILL!  :D  Kay, so, BLIT(Z), which I didn't think about, is best.  All other plays open, and that's something I'm just not gonna do.  So yeah, that's why I played L(A)W, which doesn't even rank.

#note Haha.  Wow.  I've seen BIACETYL before along with ACERBITY (sometimes I link hard words that are one-offers, like the time I missed KEYBOARD/ROCKABYE/YEARBOOK), but it just didn't register with me that my phony anagrammed to THAT.
