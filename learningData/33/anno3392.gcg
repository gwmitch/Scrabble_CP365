>Kevin: MY 8G MY +14 14
>Cesar: AEEIOOU -AEIOOU +0 0
#note this was a little annoying. i'd just drawn awful in game 1 after drawing everything in the early bird and was wondering if i was going to have another albany... but it's too early to be thinking like that, if at all.
>Kevin: EINNORZ -IENN +0 14
>Cesar: BEEKNOY 9G YOK +35 35
#note (-0.5) to YOB for presumably its higher defensive value? 
>Kevin: EFZ J8 FEZ +46 60
#note at this point i was like why didn't i add the E. oh well
>Cesar: BBEEHNV K5 HEBE +23 58
#note (-5) K5 NEVE for some reason i don't understand.
>Kevin: ERX L4 REX +34 94
>Cesar: BEILNUV L8 UNVEIL +27 85
>Kevin: DEN M3 DEN +16 110
>Cesar: AABIOTW J2 WAIT +22 107
#note K11 BOA or a bunch of other stuff. makes sense. don't know why i thought it was time to start taking risks. (-5.5)
>Kevin: ?IJNORU 14F JUNIORs +90 200
>Cesar: ABILNO 1J ALBINO +41 148
#note don't know what my 7th tile was but this had to be right.

#note or K11 HOER.
>Kevin: S 6J S.. +23 245
>Cesar: ADEEINW 10H WI. +30 207
#note ok, i have to give my opp an S here. i really need to do that defensive exercises thing a friend sent me, because i don't know what to do in that situation. i could probably give opp ES or ES?, i don't know. WIZ sims best with just the S. with ES? .... 6J SEXED! nice, this is probably the play then. (-4)
>Kevin: ?AEORRS 11C ROAStER +79 324
>Cesar: ADEENTU C7 UNDE.EAT +74 281
#note undereat for the added volatility
>Kevin: CITU 8A TU.IC +24 348
>Cesar: ADELLQV 8J ...DAL +30 311
#note this is starting to look a little hopeless. maybe -LQV? my move sims a little higher.
>Kevin: GM 12B G.M +20 368
>Cesar: ELOQRTV 3I Q.T +22 333
>Kevin: AEP 7M APE +16 384
>Cesar: ADELORV 11K L.V +12 345
#note this is a blunder, adeor kind of sucks right now -- should just do LEVO i think. 15E DOPE is somethig i also considered, but thought the V on my rack would just screw it up too much. DOPE and LEVO sim at the top... (-10)
>Kevin: GGINO N10 GOING +29 413
>Cesar: AADEORS E7 O.A +5 350
#note 2N AD is the only move that gives me a chance to win, according to quackle champ player. OCA gives me a 0%. (-2.78)
>Kevin: CFIRSTT A5 CRI. +6 419
#note he completely mistracked me. i was about to be 0-2 and face mark schellenberg.
