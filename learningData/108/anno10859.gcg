>Will: ?EIOOOX 13H EXOdOI +52 266
#note Weird decision here. I was fully aware of the setup potential off of EXODOI, but I thought I would either draw an S in the best case scenario, or be able to play long down from KIWI in the worst case scenario.

>Will: ACLOTVY 8A CO.Y +45 320
#note Sim likes CLAVI best but I was much happier to put a C at 8A than at 1H. Still, CLAVI does cripple those floaters, and I could draw a second V and be in real trouble. Opp. bingo % is nearly equivalent between those two plays.

>Scott: ?AAEEGR -  +0 276
#note Scott was perilously low on time and had not yet seen his best option here, so he challenged - a huge break for me.
>Will: DNRSSTZ G10 Z.S +14 379
#note I thought that I was in serious danger of losing the game despite the challenge.
>Scott: ?AAEEGR 1H .ARAGEEn +86 362
#note Wow, what a crazy finish. Once again I luck out against a superior player.
