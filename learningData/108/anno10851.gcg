#note And on this turn I even said to myself, "too bad JUICIEST doesn't underlap." What a dope.

#note I thought this was a good play despite the risk, but I missed a much safer option that would have ended up working out much, much better: ANONYM. Three absolute clunkers in a row, easily my weakest series of plays in the tourney.

#note Rod sends me on my way to a well deserved loss.

#note CP likes MEDIAS D8. I guess I was hoping for the blank and some kind of miraculous pair of unblockable outplays, but where would those even be?
