#note OUZO K11 sims better, but I like this. I have an early 52-point lead and a better chance of controlling the board than I would with OUZO.

#note This position drove me absolutely crazy. I sat there staring at it for 5-6 minutes, and I couldn't find a single candidate move I didn't hate. I can either blow up a promising bingo rack with EARNER 15C, taking out the triple, or I can play something in line 14 like OR or NOR or ORE that gives him a free shot at blasting the triple line. I hated both options. I eventually gave up and took the points/leave of ORE. As long as I hit a bingo next turn in line 5 or 15, it should work out.

>Evans_Clinchy: HLOPSTU O1 HUL.O +24 277
#note The other intriguing option is UH D14, but I like this better. Beating him to this corner of the board forces him to bingo into a difficult H or U.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEFLPST O9 ES +23 300
#note Yeah, I know this looks weird as hell, but I like it. I think the bottom-right corner is by far the biggest threat, especially if he has a heavy play like SEXILY there. This blocks it and scores. My rack isn't bingo-prone anymore, but that isn't so relevant on this board.
>Scott_Leifer: FGL G3 FL.G +12 249
>Evans_Clinchy: EFLOPST 6M .F +13 313
#note This hits a lot of bingos, including ISOPLETH H1 if I hit one of the four (!) I's.

>Evans_Clinchy: DELOPST 1L TOP. +10 323
#note I have no clue what I'm trying to accomplish here. Just taking out the FLAGS hook with PLOTS or something is probably fine.
