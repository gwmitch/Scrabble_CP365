#note The other options here are AD(Z) C5 (quite a palatable option, I think) and DADA 7H. While I didn't consider those plays, my play seems to simulate best. It does seem like a big opener though.. I do think I was slightly unlucky with his reaction.

#note Knowing part of his rack helped me make this decision - I was contemplating changing my tiles as this move opened an extremely volatile spot. However his phony suggested that he didn't have an A or an O - he'd likely have played CAK(E) or COK(E) otherwise. My play hinged on that knowledge, attempting to create a spot for my X next move.

>Toh_Weibin: AAEISUV A13 VAU +24 184
#note I would have given more consideration to UVEA C2, because it plays off one more tile and keeps a more balanced rack. VAU (and other options like VIA) simulates best, because it takes out the TWS and scores more.
>Jack_Durand: HOR E11 ROH +31 188
>Jack_Durand: HOR --  -31 157
#note Still needs work on the 3s.
>Toh_Weibin: ABEEIIS J2 BISE +25 209
#note Also available here are ABIES K3 and the cute BASEE(J) 3B. While I personally think BASEE(J) is the best here (I believe the large score and slightly better turnover negates the moderate risk of drawing more Is), my play simulates best. ABIES is probably too volatile.
>Jack_Durand: EGHORRU K5 HO +20 177
>Toh_Weibin: AEEEIUY -AEEIUY +0 209
#note The best exchange here, keeping some insurance with the E while changing the rest to maximise my chances at picking the blank.
>Jack_Durand: MR 11A M...R +20 197
>Toh_Weibin: CEELLOQ C1 CELLO +19 228
#note Surprisingly this simulates above changing (3 ply), despite the lurking dangers in the bag. CP disagrees (exchange keeping EL looks best), and I suspect correctly. Why did I play this? I think I take more risks than I should sometimes...
>Jack_Durand: NU B5 NU +10 207
>Toh_Weibin: ?EIIQRR 1A RI.IER +27 255
#note I did see (C)IRQuE but passed on it, thinking that I could keep a slight advantage while still playing off many tiles to draw the important tiles while avoiding duplicate Is and Rs. I don't think I should have been afraid of those duplicates now - the bag looks rather healthy from what I see.
>Jack_Durand: GNOW A6 GOWN +27 234
>Toh_Weibin: ?AIOQRY K1 QI +15 270
#note Interestingly the exchanges simulate the best here on 3 ply - namely exchanging AIOQY, IOQY and IOQ in that order. CP thinks that QI is the best, though, and it may be right...
>Jack_Durand: AHSU 1K .UASH +54 288
#note Jack underscored this move by 9 points, I think.
>Toh_Weibin: ?AEIORY I2 OA. +16 286
#note Best on CP. I didn't expect that.

#note This is quite difficult to analyse considering that Jack overdrew. Opening three from his rack, I saw ?GS and returned the blank. Is it then right to bingo, knowing that the blank is in the bag and Jack might not have a bingo to go out, then? Or is it still better to play safe by not playing bingos? If I don't bingo, is SENTRY the right play? Should I score less and keep my rack less volatile, risking him leaving the bag with 1 and picking the blank? Or should I play 6 with (S)INTERY, scoring 10 points less but forcing him to empty the bag? This is a position which I think is very unique - I could have analysed the situation taking into account Jack's word knowledge. There was a possibility of Jack not finding the hypothetical bingos he had on his rack, which diminishes his response bingo chances, making the case for me to bingo somewhat stronger. I do think, however, that given all the circumstances, (S)INTERY is the best play - it gives me a significantly larger chance of drawing the last blank and plays off the I, which would be a nuisance to my next rack.
>Jack_Durand: AGPS L3 GASP +24 336
>Toh_Weibin: ?IIOOTU O6 OOTId +17 337
#note (A)Ts 14A is CP's choice, followed by ObIIT O6. Wasn't sure of TOWIES. If I'd played SINTERY and picked up the blank I'd have ??IOOTU for rIOTOUs 14C. If I didn't pick the blank up, I'd need the R or the S. Pretty decent chances, I think.
