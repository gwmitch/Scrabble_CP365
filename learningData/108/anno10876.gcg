>Matthew_Larocque: AAIKOQS H7 QI +22 22
#note Classic QI opening, can't go wrong with that.
>Emil_Rem: ACFIR I3 FARCI +27 27
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFKOS H3 OKA +30 52
>Emil_Rem: AHSY J7 SHAY +30 57
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEFSS 5D SEAF..ED +48 100
#note Even though I managed to get away with this terrible phony, I could have played AFE(AR)ED for 44 and kept my S. So I still suck. I think I saw AFE(AR)D but wasn't sure if it could be spelled with the extra E. I'm not sure how that makes sense, because the former looks ridiculous.
>Emil_Rem: EY 6F YE +31 88
>Matthew_Larocque: BGHOSTW 4C BOW +25 125
#note GHTS seems like it's not bad for a 4 consonant leave just for all the words ending in -GHT.
>Emil_Rem: IN K8 IN +9 97
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGHIST L8 SIGHTED +86 211
#note Well that was fortunate. I actually saw DIGHT first, but then came to my senses.
>Emil_Rem: ??DIORU 13F OUtRID.r +68 165
#note His highest scoring play is DIUROns/DURIOns M3 - I didn't even know that combo myself.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDENOUV 14B VODUN +26 237
#note Debated between this and BOUND, sim says it's close.
>Emil_Rem: AW H13 .WA +15 180
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIJOT 13C JO +39 276
#note I always forget that JABOT is a word - playing at 3B.
>Emil_Rem: AGT 15C GAT +23 203
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEILTT 3C ABET +31 307
#note Wow, (WE)TTABLE for 32.
>Emil_Rem: L C2 L.. +5 208
#note Well, guess Emil wanted to let me know he's got the final S. So I should probably do something about those S hooks.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNNRTU M5 LUNT +12 319
#note INTURN, didn't know it.
>Emil_Rem: GO 11L .OG +7 215
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNRT 10C ENTIREL. +63 382
#note I guess I don't even have to worry if he bingos now. This word actually has anagram.
>Emil_Rem: R E3 ...R +13 228
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIINP N9 CI. +8 390
#note Even though I should block here - if I had seen P(L)ANE for 36 I might have been tempted to play it. PIE 9C wins the sim. I have no idea what that means.
>Emil_Rem: O E10 .O +4 232
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINPU 2C .A +8 398
#note Pretty sure he can't bingo now unless he has something like MISRATE.
>Emil_Rem: TX 6L T.X +26 258
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINPRU G8 PU.E +11 409
#note Don't know - just trying to end the game now. Considering his next play, maybe throwing my N down at 10N? lol. Naw, he still might have SA(D)/S(HOG).
>Emil_Rem: EILMS O11 SMILE +38 296
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMNNR J12 A.M +11 420
#note Yikes, I really lost focus here. I looked at the X forever and somehow still couldn't find REMI(X). What the hell is wrong with me. Never mind ME(LA)NIN. Then I just decided to take out this TLS so he couldn't use it, or something. But I forgot about Z(E)P.
>Emil_Rem: EEOPRVZ C9 Z.P +24 320
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNR N4 NI. +12 432
#note Very bad. I gave up a chunk of spread here. I need to give myself more time so I don't make bad hasty plays like this. Just do something stupid like EN N14 instead.
