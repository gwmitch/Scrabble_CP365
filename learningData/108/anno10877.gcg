>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIIOP -AAIIOP +0 0
#note Sim likes keeping PE or APE or even IPE. Meh. I always end up vowel heavy when I keep more than 1.
>Wesley_Yocom: BFI 8G FIB +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGOST 9E GOATEES +73 73
>Wesley_Yocom: AGNP K5 PANG. +16 32
>Matthew_Larocque: DEKOOSY J4 YOKE +43 116
#note I didn't even know about GOOKY. I wasn't sure if YOK or YOKE would be better. It's pretty much even in the sim.
>Wesley_Yocom: ?INOOPS E2 SPOONIn. +70 102
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEFOSY 10I EF +31 147
#note I wanted to keep the Y to play alongside PANGS next turn - trying to maximise points. Unfortunately I gave him just the opening he needed.
>Wesley_Yocom: AILNRST 11D RATLINS +76 178
>Matthew_Larocque: DEOOSY 8K .OODY +33 180
#note Whatever my 7th letter was, this was probably one of the better options.
>Wesley_Yocom: QTU 7C QU.T +23 201
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEENS D10 B.AE +12 192
#note Was totally stumped on this play. Just trying to set up my S with a good leave. Sim kinda likes it, but likes 7M BAA the most. I guess 11 more points is helpful.
>Wesley_Yocom: LUV E13 LUV +8 209
#note This play surprised me at the time.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHNSZ 2B GNA.H +34 226
#note This seemed like a better choice than HAZES for 47, why unload all my ammo at once, and while giving him easy points?
>Wesley_Yocom: ACEH 1F ACHE +32 241
>Matthew_Larocque: AELMOSZ C12 ZEAL +43 269
#note I spend awhile here with the wealth of options. I had no idea that DAMOSEL could also be spelled with a Z! Damn. Nothing really compares to 102 points.
>Wesley_Yocom: ANTTU L1 TAUNT +17 258
>Matthew_Larocque: CIIMORS 15E .IM +8 277
#note Yes I'm actually doing this. Wesley likes to go bingo crazy whenever he plays me so I feel like I need to do something drastically stupid to pull out a win.
>Wesley_Yocom: IL 8B LI +13 271
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIIORS H13 CIS +42 319
#note So I actually made 42 points here, but then.....
>Wesley_Yocom: DEEIRRT 13H .REDITER +74 345
#note I KNEW THIS CRAP WAS NO GOOD AND I LET IT GO CAUSE I SAW JU(R)OR AND THOUGHT I COULD OUTRUN HIM. The problem with that logic is there's a Y at 8O, and knowing Wesley, he's going to draw a bingo to it and annihilate me.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIJORU O11 JU.OR +39 358
>Wesley_Yocom: ?DEMNOR O1 MODERNl. +92 437
#note Really now. I'm pretty sure that's the worst possible thing that could have happpened here. Might as well challenge just for the fun of it.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIVWW -  +0 358
>Wesley_Yocom: AERX 12K AXE +43 480
#note Weeeeeeee
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIVWW N2 WED +30 388
#note Yeah I saw V(O)WED after oh well.
>Wesley_Yocom: R J13 .R +4 484
>Wesley_Yocom:  (IIVW) +20 504
#note So, as crappy as that ended up being, letting him have *CREDITER was just plain moronic.
