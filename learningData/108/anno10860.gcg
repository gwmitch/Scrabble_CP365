#note So far so good, but now I lose my head. AG is not the worst option here but it is far from the best. I was sorely tempted to play SUIT and I quite honestly have no idea why I didn't. I was not cognizant of the TUB/TAB setup for my S yet.

#note Now I see the TUB setup, but I thought there were more tiles than there actually were in the bag and didn't bother to check! CP likes AD, but I can't really envision that working very well. Obviously AZONS is an instant loss and AZO is pretty grim too if I draw OUTINGS. If Chris does not yet have the Z and I somehow avoid it too, it still seems like it will be next to impossible for me to actually get a bingo down. 9H DUI looks a little more realistic, and maybe just TUB would work sometimes.
