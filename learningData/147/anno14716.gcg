#note Our club received a visit from the lovely Andrea Michaels this week- she comes by annually to dog-sit for her Minneapolis neighbors, who take a week-long vacation every year. It is apparently her deepest desire in life to be able to walk her dog alongside a lake, but she cannot normally do this since San Francisco is a Land of 0 Lakes. This curious arrangement, however, enables her to do so!

#note Mindlessly simple, just how I like 'em

#note Weird situation... this is passable
>Andrea_Michaels: ?AEOSUV 5E OUtSAVE +92 131
>Andrea_Michaels: ?AEOSUV --  -92 39
#note This didn't seem quite right. I figured I would have seen OUTSAVED before, so I hit the clock. While going through possible bingos she may have overlooked in this rack, I managed to find the one 7- but man, is it easy to miss! Only one bingo, and one spot for it- plays at I2
>Jack_Overby: ?DGLRTY I7 DRY +50 104
#note I almost made some ghastly play like D(EX)Y before thankfully wising up. Was a little worried about giving up a spot for the bingo, but I figured she might miss it again, since it is so tough to spot (a blank Z?? What is this, Soviet Russia??)
>Andrea_Michaels: ?AEOSUV J5 AVO +17 56
>Jack_Overby: ?DEGLST 8D ......S +24 128
#note Made this play for several reasons. One, the only bingos through the A (gladiest, gladdest) would slot a letter in the triple lane- and with ?ESU, I didn't want her droppin no triple-triple. Also, by keeping things tight, I would force her to open them up and maybe hit a "nine-timer" (for you redcoats) myself. Thirdly, and most importantly... I missed GoLDEST. ChÃ­ngame (which does not work in Spanish, but I like it). Honestly, I should have just done GL(E)DES 10B

#note F*$#$*! D-ELUSIVE. I thought I was confusin it with D-ELUSORY, D-ELUDING, etc. Dang it

#note Ooh, C3 C(L)A(C)H 41
>Jack_Overby: AEHORUU M2 RAH +21 265
#note Jesus, please forgive me. I am unworthy to tread upon thy holy grounds. Or go anywhere near a Scrabble board ever again. 2B AUREO(LA) 18 looks mahvelous

>Andrea_Michaels: IQ 5A QI +15 234
#note While I am still in the middle of exchanging, she lays this down. Aye, if only I had kept a U! Maybe I should have just passed and kept my original letters!
>Jack_Overby: ADENSTY M8 .SYNDETA +76 341
#note Except I am the luckiest gosh darn mofo on the planet. Thank you Allah
>Andrea_Michaels: AEEILRS 14F EARLIES. +62 296
#note She intentionally passed on REALISE(D), I don't quite remember why
>Jack_Overby: EFIINPT H12 FI.N +33 374
#note Feeling pretty good right here....
>Andrea_Michaels: BDINOOW C9 WOODBIN +95 391
#note ....until I got slammed over the head with a big F-in bin of wood!! What a play, Andrea! She was not at all sure about this, and seemed surprised that I accepted it so readily. Que increible
>Jack_Overby: EIIKOPT 15A PI.KO +48 422
#note Thankfully, I had a lucrative counterplay
>Andrea_Michaels: MO L12 OM. +20 411
#note Don't remember what she had here- apparently neither of my U's?
>Jack_Overby: EEIOOTU A5 .UITE +42 464
>Andrea_Michaels: GINNRTU 11J TUR. +14 425
#note 10B T(OE)ING 32 is best, or 13C (B)URN 8 to block my outplay
>Jack_Overby: EOO 13B O.OE +6 470
>Jack_Overby:  (GINN) +10 480
#note Not a bad start to the day after a whole Scrabble-free quarter. 3-0! Some missteps here and there, some rather egregious, but some pretty cool plays as well- another hats off for WOODBIN, hot dang. Could I perhaps achieve the elusive 4-0? Or would it be naught but a delusive fantasy? You will soon find out
