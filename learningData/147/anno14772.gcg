>Matthew_Larocque: ADDTVVX I7 V.X +25 25
#note TAX? I had a hard time believing DDVV was worth the extra points.
>Bill_Payne: ANU J8 .UNA +15 35

>Bill_Payne: ORW 7K ROW +16 51
>Matthew_Larocque: DFKLNOT L10 FON +20 73
#note I saw this play right away, and assumed there must be a better play. So I kept looking and nothing looked great. FON is simming 2nd to TOD in the same spot.
>Bill_Payne: UU -UU +0 51
>Matthew_Larocque: DKLOSTZ 14K .OLK +22 95
#note After an exchange two, I knew I was asking for trouble by opening up a prime S-hook. DOZ(Y) could also end badly. I guess I was hoping he missed his bingo and that I might get to play ZEST next turn with an E draw.
>Bill_Payne: ??EEJRS O8 JEstERS +101 152
#note This was not a good tournament for me haha.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIOSTZ 6M AZO +37 132
#note Another ill effect of my (Y)OLK play is that the board got murdered. I really should have played DOZ(Y) so that didn't happen.

#note I don't know
>Bill_Payne: AELT 2J .ELTA +12 185
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIOSTT I3 TI +8 156
#note Quackle, how do you think I'm going to outscore him filling in the cracks on the right side of the board?
>Bill_Payne: AOR 3L OAR +14 199
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIPRST H4 PA +15 171
#note Now I have a chance.... right?
>Bill_Payne: IIN 5E INI. +8 207
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIORST 1N OI +9 180
#note Not with draws like this.

#note Missed (LO)C(A) for the fish.

#note Didn't get my rack, but this play seemed like it could make it close.
>Bill_Payne: CEU 2A CUE +13 255

>Bill_Payne: BO 10L .OB. +14 269

#note Not sure what I'm aiming for. I should exchange.
>Bill_Payne: EGILNST D6 .ESTLING +70 339
#note As this came down, it became a reality. I was finishing 4-10. I never thought I could suck that bad. Every time I made a dumbass play this tournament, I paid for it by losing the game. This game it was (Y)OLK, Siri was (C)OIL, Paul was *APNOEAE. Wendy was..... well, that one is so incredibly horrible I don't even know if I wanna post it. And I usually post everything no matter the level of suckage.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFGIIR 13A FRI.GED +30 288
#note I actually thought this was a phony.

>Matthew_Larocque:  (H) +8 301
#note I think Bill owes me a thanks, the only two games he won were against me!
