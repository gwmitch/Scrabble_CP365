>Evans_Clinchy: AEJNOPT 7H JO +25 25
#note A lot of things sim close, including JOE and JEAT# at J6. I think I like this option best since it has the lowest opp bingo percentage, which is important given his two-tile opening.
>Jim_Kramer: HIN 9G HIN +28 38

>Jim_Kramer: ?ABORST 10B BORSTAl +81 119
>Evans_Clinchy: ENOOOSY 10J YO +31 91
#note OOSY# K5 for 39 sims a bit better. The ENOOS leave doesn't hit quite enough bingos to be worthwhile.

>Jim_Kramer: GHO H12 .HOG +30 185
>Evans_Clinchy: AABENOW 9B AWA +25 204
#note Two misses here -- BESAW# N10 and BOWAT# F6. I am bad at fives.
>Jim_Kramer: IILRSTV 14C VITRI.LS +65 250
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEENOQ E12 QA. +12 216
#note Fairly weak. Missed the AHINT# hook to play QAT for 20, or I could also play BEE 11B for the points and wait on the Q. Five I's in the bag to bail me out.
>Jim_Kramer: IMZ 8D MIZ +25 275
>Evans_Clinchy: BEENNOU 11A BONE +23 239
#note A few things sim close. I probably would have played UNBONE# K1 if I'd been sure it was good. BOSUN N10 is also an option, but that looks kinda suicidal.

#note Wow. Didn't even see the spot DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THIS ONE. I'm gonna lose either way, since the pool's scary and he's bound to have a big play soon, but still, I'm an idiot.

#note FIE is best, keeping UNDE L4 in reserve.
