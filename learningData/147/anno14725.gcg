>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?ACEMRY 10G g.AMERCY +78 78
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHIOUU 11J UH +24 68
#note OU(C)HED? Okay I didn't even know OUCH had another meaning.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OV 12F VO. +13 91
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIOOUV I4 VIDEO +14 82
#note Everything sucks here...really... but sim goes with (C)OVED since it scores 8 extra points and apparently IOU isn't that much worse than OU.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADQS 5G QA.DS +30 121
>Matthew_Larocque: EEOOSUU -EOOUU +0 82
#note I sense that this is going to be an uphill battle.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EG F12 .EG +11 132
>Matthew_Larocque: EHKLPST 13E K.P +19 101
#note If I can draw some vowels I'll be golden. I had no idea how big of an if that was going to be.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AFNN N6 FANN. +19 151
>Matthew_Larocque: EHLSTTT 8L HE.T +33 134
#note Come on.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OPY M10 .OPY +22 173
>Matthew_Larocque: GILNSTT M5 GIT. +14 148
#note <_> Do I seriously just play GLINTS here and give up? Apparently Siri has like 18 vowels on his rack. I missed GIL(D) despite looking at the Q.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DEOSZ O2 DOZES +31 204
#note I was lucky he didn't play SKEP, for whatever reason.
>Matthew_Larocque: ALNNSTW N1 LAW +23 171
#note Well eventually the bag is gonna run out of consonants right?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEL 4I .EAL +19 223
>Matthew_Larocque: EFLNSST J2 FL.. +16 187
#note *Throws the tile bag across the room*  And I missed the 33 point EFT, but I'm starting to get clingy to my vowels haha.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BI 6F BI +21 244
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNSST D7 SENNITS +76 263
#note Despite that frustrating sequence, I could still win this. Unless I make some kind of colossally bad play. Sigh....
>Siri_Tillekeratne: MU L12 UM +23 267
>Matthew_Larocque: CILNRRU 8A CUR.R +21 284
#note ULC(E)R, sim also likes CRU but then you know JA(U)k or WA(U)R would come down.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EIIOORU -IIOOU +0 267
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNOR A8 .OIL +6 290
#note So I'm just gonna go ahead and lose the game now because I always miss COLINEAR and didn't even know it's anagram for some reason. This is such a weak play.... almost as weak as Keanu Reeves acting in the movie Sweet November. Holy crap was that ever bad.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AGINTW B10 TAWING +30 297
#note I figured there was a good chance Siri wouldn't be able to score much here.... but that didn't work out.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRTU A13 TEA +22 312
#note The sim's choice is A(G)UE, but this is tough. I can play RUNTIE(R) and hope that I can somehow play out before he can.  Fish off the U? That won't work. I don't know what will work here.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: JO E5 JO +23 320
>Matthew_Larocque: DINRRTU E10 UT +10 322
#note There was 9 unseen vowels when I played TEA, and I didn't draw a single one. I missed two good plays here - L6 DU(H) and (MU)RID. But I messed around with another interesting play - R(IFS). I think I might have actually won the game with that move! Siri can't play out in two moves if he has to draw another vowel. Damn.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?AEEEII C3 AIrIE. +15 335
#note All of Siri's winning plays are in this spot.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINORR D1 RIND +20 342
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EE 14F .EE +9 344
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (EOR) +6 350
#note For as much as I complained, the loss is still on me. Not only did I miss the bingos, (C)OIL was just dreadful. And I couldn't decipher the endgame.
