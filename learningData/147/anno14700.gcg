#note I didn't want to leave the 3x3 open, and I figure OK i'm scoring 27 and holding onto the Z...quackle likes FADO(S) for 35 better. (-5)

#note I sat here for a good 4-5 minutes and thought....didn't like any of my options. AMAD(O)U is the play, didn't see it. I wanted the U off of my rack, especially since the Q is gone (normally I'm more likely to keep a U if the Q is still out, at any point), and playing amadou accomplishes that as well as scoring 24.

#note Yeah, idk. I saw this on my rack, thougt I saw it somewhere before. And given that before he play (O)RA it was homeless, I got excited.
