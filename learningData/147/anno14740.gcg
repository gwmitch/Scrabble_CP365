#note Fortuitously setting up EX/APEX.
>Jonathan: UU -UU +0 21
>Bill: ?AEIITX I6 EX +40 137
#note Played this instantly and didn't notice TAXI (didn't notice it last turn, either). Quackle says it's a toss-up, but I'd definitely have taken TAXI.
>Jonathan: ?AEGINS 10D ErASING +69 90
#note Missing some Z bingos.
>Bill: ?AEIIPT I2 PIA +17 154
#note Also missing Z bingos. I saw PATINIZE and couldn't convince myself it was good. Completely whiffed on TRAPEZII *sigh*.
>Jonathan: EHY 11D HEY +30 120
>Bill: ?EEHIST 12F SHElTIE +76 230
#note Didn't see EPITHETS or TIPSHEET for two more, but this has to be better anyway.
>Jonathan: AIN J1 AIN +13 133
>Bill: AAIMNNT K2 ANTIMAN +76 306
>Jonathan: ADEGINS H12 .GAD +18 151
#note Put down AGNISED# initially.
>Bill: BJLNRTU 11K BRUNT +24 330
#note So, okay, I know he kept EINS, but there's also FFUUUVVWW and no blanks unseen. I really don't think this was that reckless...
>Jonathan: DEIINOS O8 EDI.IONS +140 291
#note EFF. MY. LIFE.
>Bill: EGJLLRV 14F GR.VEL +16 346
#note Okay, should still be fine, let's get to work killing these last few lanes.
>Jonathan: ACI 13L CIA. +17 308
>Bill: CJLOOUV N5 JUCO +17 363
#note JEHU woulda been cool; I didn't see it, but this still must be right. I'll be 55 ahead having just killed the last bingo lane with no hotspots left to speak of.
>Jonathan: BEE L7 BEE +13 321
>Bill: DDLORRV 15J DORR +11 374
>Jonathan: AE 13H .AE +16 337
>Bill: DFFLLOV 6M L.V +6 380
#note I didn't see FLU yet this turn, but I still like LUV, since the V might be impossible to get rid of if VID is blocked. This also blocks any possible O1 plays, unlikely though they may be.
>Jonathan: OW 15E WO +8 345
>Bill: DFFLMOR M9 FL. +19 399
>Jonathan: ERTU C11 TRUE +18 363
>Bill: DFMORTW B13 MOW +24 423
#note Dang, didn't notice that WED sets up an unblockable FROM for 47. I was just getting it over with at this point, but I should be practicing endgame scenarios like this whenever I get a chance.
