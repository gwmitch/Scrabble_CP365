>Bob_Lundegaard: DFNORUV H4 VODUN +26 26
#note Opening vertically like a.... despicable prick
>Jack_Overby: ?AEIINT 4H .ANITIEs +70 70
#note Best bingo
>Bob_Lundegaard: EFIOORR J2 FI.O +15 41
#note Thank you, Bob, for not giving me a spot to try ROOFIER#. I considered 5J OF 22, which is best, but didn't like it for some dumb reason. This is lousy, and doesn't even show up. But everything here is ugly
>Jack_Overby: STUY 2J .USTY +22 92
#note Not sure about the rest of the rack, but could have done N2 SU(E)TY 32
>Bob_Lundegaard: CEGOORR O4 .CORER +21 62
#note Ugh, O4 (s)CROOGE way better, as is (s)ORGO. But this doesn't sim too badly
>Jack_Overby: ADEW N6 WADE +36 128
#note Boy.....

#note I used to always miss this, but not no more
>Jack_Overby: AQ 12K QA. +24 186
>Bob_Lundegaard: AAEOOPR -AOO +0 164
#note Apparently best. With all these nice letters to play through, I figured I'd have a go at a bingo. Nothing scores very well here except K1 O(U)R(I)E 21, which I admittedly missed, though its AAOP leave is horrendous
>Jack_Overby: BEH 10J HEB. +17 203
>Bob_Lundegaard: AEEPRRU 6A UPREARE. +69 233
#note Thank you for not blocking this, Bob! This is good, though it sure effs up the board
>Jack_Overby: AJP D3 JAP. +26 229
>Bob_Lundegaard: CDILMNR K1 L.R.D +25 258
#note Wussed out on MURID in the same spot, which is a fair bit better
>Jack_Overby: DEO E3 ODE. +30 259
>Bob_Lundegaard: CIILMNW 13J WIN. +20 278
#note A little bit worried about opening up an -ES bingo, but why not... 7G M(U)CIN 23, 13J MIL(S) slightly better
>Jack_Overby: EGL E8 .GLE +10 269
>Bob_Lundegaard: CEFILMO 14F CLIME +24 302
#note I mean, what was I thinking... defensive paranoia, plus opening up the possibility of a nice F play. I need help in situations like this- close things down, or keep them open and hope to hit a bingo? This just seemed like a tough scenario, with no clear best play or objective to pursue
>Jack_Overby: AMSX H11 MAX.S +45 314
#note I deserved worse. But he did block ZO(I)c 66, unfortunately!
>Bob_Lundegaard: ?FIIOVZ 11B FIV. +10 312
#note 12A VIZIr/VIZOr 45 way better. Once again, close game, weird scenario, no clue what to do. But this worked out gloriously, borderline miraculously
>Jack_Overby: BIU 3B BI..U +28 342
>Bob_Lundegaard: ?ILNOYZ 15J dOZILY +86 398
#note That'll do, pig... that'll do...
>Jack_Overby: AGNOSTT -  +0 342
#note Challenged, understandably
>Bob_Lundegaard: AENO G11 ANO.E +24 422
#note Obscenely convenient draw for the outplay
>Bob_Lundegaard:  (AGNOSTT) +16 438
#note Undeserved, but I will take it!
