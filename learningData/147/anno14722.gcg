#note Wheels start to fall off. ETHNIC is a huge miss. Dammit.

#note Sim says play the Q off. Didn't look like a way to win to me

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ACLRSX N1 LAX +42 340
#note I spent a lot of time debating CRUX vs LAX. Best bingo potential vs. a shot at outrunning. I did not even see the huge bombs at 13H. EXTRAS, EXTRACT, etc. The blank must have blinded me there. In any case, CRUX is the top simming play. I would totally have taken EXTRAS if I'd seen it though. Although it leads to a lot of ugly Q endgames. CRUYX wins 63%, EXTRAS 56 and LAC 52.

#note And then I blow the endgame with 5 minutes to solve it. I saw ARCHES, but just couldn't spot the second half of that sequence to score lots of points. I spent time looking for bingos, trying to get my tracking right (I had Adam as GVEO and another unknown tile) and didn't spent enough time looking for the best sequence. So I ran out of time and threw this down. I wish I had run out of time and thrown ARCHES down because then I'd have seen SORE for sure. I don't know SCARPH, which is the other win. Eff me
