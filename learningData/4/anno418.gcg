#note This was sort of an experiment. FIN? has decent synergy, but the more straightforward exchange of FIUV probably would have worked out better.

#note No need to keep an E with so many remaining. I thought the K might come in handy, though.

#note Not the greatest move. I (correctly) calculated that there was no point in fishing off an O, since there was no way to win even if the blank was somehow in the bag, but I should have gone a step further. GOALIE at 13J instead would have the advantage of blocking racks of lEUCINE and lEUCITE, and wouldn't give up any additional bingos in the other cases.
