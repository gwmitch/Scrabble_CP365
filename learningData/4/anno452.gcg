#note CUIF K8 sims best, but it sure seems awful. Only 18 points, horrible CGUY leave, opens QI/XI hotspot.

#note I think this was wrong. With the great tile pool, opponent was almost certain to have a bingo after the exchange 6. I should have played FOU G13, to go up by 34 on a tight board and keep the excellent AELS.

#note Incredibly, there were 4 spots for opponent to go out with his ANOY, in 3 disparate areas of the board. How annoying!
