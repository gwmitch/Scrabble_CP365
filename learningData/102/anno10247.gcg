#note Best.
>Tracy_Bowman: FHIT F6 FI.TH +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: DEELNRT H5 REL.NTED +61 91
#note Best placement, as it's the highest scoring option.  The other placements (H2, H7) score 60.
>Tracy_Bowman: EIPQU 12C PIQUE. +36 63
>Jim_Burlant: ADINNSS 13D DINS +25 116
#note Q prefers 13C ANIS 31; I don't mind giving up the 6 scoreboard points to keep a vowel. Burning both S's with 13B SASIN seems stupid for only 33 points.  I don't know why Q thinks that's better than this.

>Jim_Burlant: BEPSSST M2 BEST +21 164
#note Right idea, wrong execution. This is mediocre, as it gives up a little too much on the scoreboard for the sake of leave.  The sim likes 6J PESTS best.  Problem with that is it'll tell my human opponent that I have 3 S's in the rack.  I want her to think there's at least one in the bag. 3G PST looks right here.  This is a 5-point dog.
>Tracy_Bowman: AHR 5C RAH +27 129
>Jim_Burlant: AIJLPSS 2K JI.S +26 190
#note I hate having to keep burning S's, but these replicated racks leave me no choice.  This is best, winning 83%.
>Tracy_Bowman: CI 10H .IC +11 140
>Jim_Burlant: AGLPRSU D8 .UG +7 197
#note No idea what to do, and nothing really scores here that leaves me anything good.  Q's top choice is a very strong play that I missed:  LUG 11B, setting up the P and S hooks.  While it is a hair risky, I have the hooks in my rack and probably should have taken the chance.  This is weak.
>Tracy_Bowman: IKO K10 KOI +24 164
>Jim_Burlant: AAILPRS 12J P.AL +12 209
#note Wanted to open things up a bit since this was rapidly shutting down.  Best appears to be 3G PA.  But this did work out...sort of.
>Tracy_Bowman: AEOZ M9 AZO.E +30 194
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIRST 14H AERIEST +83 292
#note Nervous about the placement, but LEARIEST 7H (the only other bingo) gives up way too much on the scoreboard.
>Tracy_Bowman: BEIX 15E IBEX +66 260
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADNOOY 7H .OONY +9 301
#note This is where the game started got tough.  The only place to score was down the N column, and the unseen pool threatened any number of plays that could have lost me the game.  At this point, I felt Quackle went out the window and biding my time was the main concern.  Quackle suggests a bunch of N column plays that are too dangerous IMO.
>Tracy_Bowman: LORT 3G ROTL +25 285
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACDGRU 10B DU. +9 310
#note Same problem as the last turn, with an additional option of 13A GRA(DINS) being just as dangerous as the N column plays given the unseen IN?.  Another turn to have to sweat for me; feeling damned if I did and damned if I didn't, my gut said to take this to an end game, as I was confident that I would have a stronger end game than my 1300-level opponent, and this is what happened.
>Tracy_Bowman: EW 13I WE +23 308
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEGGR N8 CRAp +23 333
#note Now that I know she can't do anything substantial down the O column, I'll take out that Z hook and set up my G's.  Play incorrectly scored as 24.
