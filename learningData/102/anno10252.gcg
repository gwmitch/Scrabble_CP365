>Jim_Burlant: ABCHLNN 8D BLANCH +32 32
#note Q prefers the 8G placement by roughly 1-1/2 points.  I don't mind sacrificing 2 scoreboard points due to vowel placement.
>Mike_Paxson: ADNRY D8 .RANDY +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: FIIIIIN -FIIII +0 32
#note Yes, that's the actual rack.  Normally I'd throw the I back, but I figured that, with five of them in my rack it was safe to keep one.  Q agrees - this is the best exchange.  Exchange 6 keeping N sims 1-1/2% winning chances and 3 points down on this, and exchange 7 about the same as exchange 6.
>Mike_Paxson: MO C12 OM +25 49
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNOP E10 NO +10 42
#note Nothing really good; best play is E7 PLENA; I didn't look to do more than dink off NO.  This sims way down the list, but it only conceds 2% and e equity despite that.
>Mike_Paxson: DEEINST B6 ENDITES +66 115
#note Best bingo for Mike. He's winning 74% in a short sim (< 250 iterations).
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKNPS A6 PAIK +51 93
#note I suspected I was missing something; the 8's I'd find in this rack are SNAKEPIT, SPEAKING, and RANPIKES.  Of couirse, the one that played was one I didn't know:  CAPESKIN H8 101.  But if I had to whiff, this was a good consolation prize.  This is the best non-bingo option.
>Mike_Paxson: FORU C3 FOUR +19 134
>Jim_Burlant: AAEILNS H8 .ANALISE +83 176
#note Missed this in April against Jesse Matthews and I wasn't about to repeat.  This is best (the other bingos are ALANINES airballs in the G column).  I'm winning 61% in a short sim.
>Mike_Paxson: EJT 14F JE.T +27 161
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIORW 10H .EWIE +16 192
#note Too blinded by the duplicated I's to find a better play.  WEER D1 is best, though this sims respectably - not quite 3 points and only 1-1/2% down on WEER.  Was a little concerned about opening up the 2x2, but really - what's the worst that could happen?
>Mike_Paxson: ??CHPRT K5 PaTCH.eR +102 263
#note I think we have our answer.  Other options are STROPHIC, ATROPHIC, PHRATRIC, HERPETIC.  Whatever, they all score 102 and they all win around 80 - 81% and put me in a world of hurt.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIORUY J5 OY +29 221
#note Missing O10 YOU, but I benefit from this mistake.  This is the bronze medalist.
>Mike_Paxson: EFT D3 EFT +29 292
>Jim_Burlant: AEIQRUW L1 QUIRE +53 274
#note Best - not quite 19% to win, and I'm hoping to catch a break that he can't extend the Q to the O1 triple.
>Mike_Paxson: AST 1L .ATS +39 331
#note Sigh...
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGIUW F10 AWE +19 293
#note Q gives slight preference to 9G EAU; I'd rather unload the W. No matter how I cut it, I'm 6% to win.
>Mike_Paxson: OZ F6 ZO. +32 363
#note The hits just keep coming...
>Jim_Burlant: AEGILSU 12K .UG +8 301
#note Q slightly prefers G5 GAIN - I don't think the extra 12 scoreboard points are going to help me if I can't bingo within the next turn or two.    This is runner-up, roughly 0.4% and 2 points behind gain.  I like this a lot and I'd do this again - it sets up my A and S.
>Mike_Paxson: BIMR I2 BRIM +17 380
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNSU N8 INULASE +73 374
#note Best bingo - just shy of 20% to win in a short sim.
>Mike_Paxson: IX O14 XI +36 416
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGGOV O4 EGGED +36 410
#note FAIL.  Looked at this for several minutes and this was all I could come up with.  After I hit the clock, I figured I'd deal with the V in the end game...
>Mike_Paxson: ILOORTV 15E VOL. +18 434
#note ...and as he was figuring out his end game, I realized that Icould have played VEGGED for 12 more points and he'd be dead.  Too bad I couldn't think of it when it mattered.  Now, as long as he didn't hang the I somewhere I could play through it, I was dead.  This would have been an epic comeback, but I just chose the wrong time to forget VEGGED.
>Jim_Burlant: ADOV M12 .OD +25 435
#note Best.
>Mike_Paxson: IORT 2D RIOT +13 447
>Mike_Paxson:  (AV) +10 457
