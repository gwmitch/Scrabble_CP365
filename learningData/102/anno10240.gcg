>Eric: EGKLTVW 8G KEG +16 16
#note Quackle prefers VEG or exchange GKVW about equally.
>Liz: ?AAEIQR 9F QI +19 19
>Eric: DELSTVW -DLVW +0 16
#note Quackle likes H3 TWELV(E)S for 29.
>Liz: ?AAENRT 10G sANTERA +64 83
#note Missing ARsENAT(E) for 74.
>Eric: AEEILST L7 LEA.IEST +68 84
>Liz: DENRTUX K10 .X +36 119
#note Best play and the DUNTER leave makes a bunch of easy words.
>Eric: ADGGOPW K5 WOAD +21 105
#note 9K D(A)P for 27 is best play but all the choices have bad leaves.
>Liz: DELNRTU M2 TRUNDLE +76 195
>Eric: AGGINOP J3 AGOG +22 127
#note J5 AG for 19 with its GINOP leave is best.
>Liz: JMRRSVV -JMRVV +0 195
#note 3I V(A)V for 13 with the JMRRS leave is supposedly better than all the exchanges, but I can't believe it!. Of the exchanges, JRVV is best, with the MRS leave. My exchange with the RS leave is next best.
>Eric: IMNOPST 4C STOMPIN. +78 205
>Liz: AEINRSU 13G ANURE.IS +70 265
>Eric: EIOOOWZ H1 ZOW.E +51 256
#note Obviously best.
>Liz: EEIMTUV 3B VIE +18 283
#note Scored as 16. The seeds of my demise are planted here. Although there was no way to know that. The sim prefers H10 (A)VE(N)UE for 30.
>Eric: AINOOUV 1F OU.O +13 269
#note The sim prefers F1 OVU(M) for 17.
>Liz: DEHMOTU 14A MOUTHED +83 366
>Eric: ABIILNV A12 BI.A +33 302
#note Best play
>Liz: FHO 15F FOH +36 402
#note I didn't write down this rack.
>Eric: CEILNSV 4L L.V +12 314
#note Sim prefers 2E VIN(O) 15. LUV is second. His win percentage is at 2.0%.
>Liz: CIY D12 CI.Y +26 428
#note I don't have this rack, either.
>Eric: CDEINST E3 D.C +20 334
#note Best play. Win percentage is still 2%. I would think it would have increased given that he just set up an I hook, and retains an excellent leave containing an I.
>Liz: ?EEILRR 7A RELIERs +63 491
#note The unseen pool is now AABEFIJNNPRSTY. That looked bad enought to me that I felt safe playing RELIERs in the triple lane. (No other bingos play.) But the pool is not that bad, especially if he has been holding onto some good tiles in the last few turns, which he has. Quackle prefers many short plays, mostly in columns A and B. Top play is practically tied between A1 REI for 18, A3 IRE for 13, and RE(v) for 12, all with a 99.8% win percentage.  RELIERs has a 97.5% win percentage.
