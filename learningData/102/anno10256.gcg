>Jim_Burlant: ANNPTTU 8E PUNT +12 12
#note Q says this is a matter of style preference as to whether PUNT or UNAPT is better.  I personally don't think 16 points is enough to only leave myself NT; I'd much rather keep ANT together.  As for this placement:  too many back hooks (O, S, Y) in the unseen pool to place render the 8G placement reckless IMO.  Q disagrees.
>Lou_Cornelis: FOU E8 .OUF +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHINT F10 HA +31 43
#note Best - no need to turn 3 with this leave.
>Lou_Cornelis: IORSV 12C VISOR +32 50
>Jim_Burlant: AEIJMNT F6 JE. +26 69
#note This is runner-up, but Q wants me to just fish off the J for 9 points.  I'll admit AEIMNT is a pretty nice leave, but I have a hard time believing it's worth 17 more points than AIMNT.  And admittedly the difference in the sim is style preference; this sims barely 0.2 pionts and .15% winning chances down on JO.  Play incorrectly scored as 27.
>Lou_Cornelis: AEEW C9 WEA.E +30 80
>Jim_Burlant: AIIMNST I3 ANIMIST +69 138
#note Best bingo is H6 TITANISM 71.  This sims roughly 5 ponts down
>Lou_Cornelis: CLNOO B6 COLON +24 104
>Jim_Burlant: DDEEGNS 14B EDGED +37 175
#note Certainly nothing wrong with scoring 37 and turning 5 with 2 blanks unseen.  But, while this is very strong, there was no need to blow this rack apart.  GED A7 scores 31 and preserves a very nice DENS.  I missed it.  The difference according to the sim is style preference, but GED should have been the play.
>Lou_Cornelis: ELZ H1 LEZ +47 151
>Jim_Burlant: GNOOPRS A9 PONG +20 195
#note Looked through the I and couldn't find any 8's, and didn't think to look through the L.  After I put this down, I saw the E and wondered if PROGNOSE was good?  Turns out it is, but I don't think I'd have had the guts to take the chance on it.  But that doesn't excuse whiffing on PRO(L)ONGS on row 1.
>Lou_Cornelis: AEELTTY -AEEL +0 151
#note Lou told me post-mortem he had X? and a bunch of garbage on this rack.  He gave serious consideration to dumping the X for 9 points to muck up row 15, but felt it was too likely to leave him in a bind if I scored somewhere else.
>Jim_Burlant: EMOORST 15E MOOTERS +84 279
#note Lucky break for me, and the worst-case scenario for Lou.  I'm 97% to win in a short sim, but not for very long.
>Lou_Cornelis: ??DENUX 13G EXUDiNg +83 234
#note Best bingo for Lou, but he's still only 12% to win.  Interesting sim result:  the sim says EX 15A wins just as often as the bingo.  
>Jim_Burlant: ABCDSTW K10 CAD. +12 291
#note No clue what to do with this - even after shuffling tiles for a couple of minutes I couldn't make head or tail of this rack.  Eventually, I gave up, rationalizing this crappy play by admitting that at least it killed potential L-column bingos.  I had also become fixated on saving the W to hook EDGED at A14.  Looking at the kibbitzer options without simming, 10I SWAB, which I didn't see, looks best.  This sucks.
>Lou_Cornelis: AEHIORT 1D AERO.ITH +62 296
#note Back from the dead - the sim says Lou is now 38% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: BEISTUW A14 WE +27 318
#note Best, despite unloading the E.  Nothing else available that scores.
>Lou_Cornelis: FITY 4I .IFTY +22 318
>Jim_Burlant: ABIRSTU M2 BU. +16 334
#note With Q unseen, I was hoping to either set up a potential QI spot for myself or, perhaps lure him into an unlikely mistake if he had it.  This worked out, but not quite as I had planned.  The sim likes this a lot - it's best, and wins 72%.
>Lou_Cornelis: AIQR K4 .AQIR +34 352
>Jim_Burlant: AILNRST M6 STARLIN. +59 393
#note I wasn't expecting this but I'll take it.
>Lou_Cornelis: BY 8M .BY +24 376
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIKL D1 .LIKE +18 411
#note As I put this down, Lou's words: "That's exactly what I would have done."
>Lou_Cornelis: EGIV 3C G.VE +16 392
>Jim_Burlant: AA L12 A.A +14 425
#note For some reason Quackle won't let me go out and keeps trying to give me a third tile.  This was the final play, final score recorded as 430 - 392.  Outside of missing PROLONGS and the weak CADI play, I was on target on all of the remaining turns.  That's about as well as I'm capable of playing.
