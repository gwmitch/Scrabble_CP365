#note I want an open board against Kenji, so OVARY is probably slightly better.

#note Also considered METEPA and PELMET. POEM is a reasonable option as well. I thought this would be less dangerous since there is already an S hook, but Kenji pointed out that, while both spots are similar for bingos, he has a good chance of scoring quite well along column A. With that in mind, another choice may have been wiser.

>Kenji: AEINSTT 9B SATINET +61 168
>Noah: EIINSTY O12 TYIN +35 180
#note I liked this better than YIN O13, because I wasn't sure how well EIST would fare afterwards, but I overlooked YETI and gave YIN too little consideration. Those are better because the O column is tough to block, and because they keep a better leave. 
>Kenji: ??AQSUZ D5 QUAr.ZeS +98 266
>Noah: EIINSST 5D .I +22 202
#note Missed TINI(N)ESS. I prefered this to IS, because it seemed harder to block, and it seemed that EINSST hit quite a bit.
>Kenji: GLOO B5 LOGO. +8 274
>Noah: EINSSTU 10M UN +13 215
#note Opens a stronger lane than US or UT, even though the leave isn't as good.

>Noah: EEEIJST 11C J.E +18 258
#note This was an unfortunate position. I'm not a fan of JEED, because it blocks more opportunities, and that's not a good plan right now. Maybe JEES and hope for a miracle? This isn't very likely to win because I don't think it scores enough, so maybe I just have to do JEES.
