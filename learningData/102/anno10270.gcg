>Nigel: ?ENQ D2 QuE.N +26 55
>Noah: IIIMRSS 11E IRIS +15 190
#note Maybe this would be fine if the score of the two IRIS plays was closer, but the other IRIS seems a bit better. He has the blank, and there are plenty of ways to open the board, so he's bound to bingo eventually.
>Nigel: AELTZ H1 ZEAL.T +48 103
>Noah: AEFIKMS K2 KIFS +42 232
#note I should play KIEFS. Opening scoring spots is good when I'm up, so that K is only a boon.
>Nigel: IX I3 XI. +37 140
>Noah: ADEMNRU G2 AM +24 256
#note I may be sacrificing too many points here by passing up MANQUE, but he does seem to bingo a fair amount of the time after it. Should I prolong the inevitable or not?
>Nigel: AF L3 FA +25 165
>Noah: DEINPRU M4 DUP +13 269
#note Not good. Didn't think of UNZIP.
>Nigel: ?AAILOT N4 OTALgIA +76 241
>Noah: BCEINOR O6 CION +32 301
#note Another miss: BICRON/BICORN O10.
>Nigel: HO F1 OH +27 268
>Noah: BDEEMRS 9M B.. +8 309
#note Lots of options here, and this seems pretty good.
>Nigel: ADEERRT 12A RERATED +75 343
>Nigel: ADEERRT --  -75 268
>Noah: DEEMNRS 12C MED +15 324
#note I was trying to set up reasonable lanes for me and have some blocking options if I don't get a bingo. On the other hand, his possible plays include some threatening setups, so other options might be better, like fishing off the M.
>Nigel: ADEERRT 13C ER +14 282
>Noah: ENORSTU 14A TONSURE +76 400
#note Didn't realize TENOURS fit at 14C, for some reason.
>Nigel: DU 6B DU. +8 290
>Noah: AEINOUV A12 VI.A +33 433
#note Missed VATU.
>Nigel: AEIRRRT 15G TARRIER +76 366
>Noah: DEIJNOU 13G JOIN +38 471
#note Didn't see THEWY until right after I hit my clock. This always happens to me, seeing things right afterwards. My mind becomes tangibly more open after I hit my clock, and I wonder how I can fix this annoying problem.
