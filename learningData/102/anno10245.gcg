#note Second behind ABAXilE, which I didn't know.

#note (shrugs) Duck's probably right, ANnEXEs at 9B is probably best. Why set up the X? Just end this madness.

#note So I've drawn five power tiles to his zero and I'm behind a bingo. Yeah, I faded a little at the end of day 2.
>Jason: ??ADINQ 15G QI.DAr +45 146
#note QAD(I) at 1A. I just got so focused on where I was going to play QINDAR, and I really wanted one of these blanks off my rack for points because I was taking so long on each of these plays. QAID at 11B, having a guaranteed trip-trip shot next turn, is also worth considering.

#note Why is this no good?! OK, I guess it makes sense. Technically to "unpeel" would be to put the peel back on, if peeling takes the peel off. But still, unpeel is a synonym for peel. Kind of like how "hang loose" and "hang tight" mean the same thing.

#note Juju had a rough tourney, although I can say in this game he did the best he could with what he drew; almost certainly played better than me.
