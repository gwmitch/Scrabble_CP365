#note Kenji laid this down, pondered, flipped the two Ns around, then flipped the two Ss around, and hit his clock. I accused him of using the board as a workspace.

#note Difficult play. I wasn't about to play MOWED 14F, but thought DEWORM, WORM, and DOW were all reasonable options. It seemed like this gave avenues to the top of the board while keeping a reasonable leave, whereas parallels to DEWORM would devastate the opening more. I wasn't a fan of the staircase created by DOW, which can be used to close the board. Of course, if I had other information, TROWED would've been the best play...
