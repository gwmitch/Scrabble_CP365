#note well crap...
>New_Player_1: DEEEIMU J9 EME +24 376
#note yes, I drew EEEI off of DUNG.  had no clue what to do here...considered EME, EMEU, NEUMES, MENU, and MUD.   I thought EME was good to setup the D, and things like MENU can still get hit with ING words...EMEU sims best at 88.2%, EME is 85.3%

#note are  you fugging kidding me?
>New_Player_1: DEEINTU B1 EN.IED +28 404
#note i feel like I am screwed here so I went kamikaze...ENVIED only wins ~15% (hey, wasn't that Ryan's chances off of EME, heh heh), somehow DUI is best and gets 50%
