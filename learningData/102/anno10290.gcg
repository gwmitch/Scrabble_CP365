#note Is Peter's game predicated on super-turnover, or is it just how it happened to work against me?

#note (shrugs) V(E)INY at I11 is probably a little better; didn't see it. Not sure about plopping the X at M13.

#note Big equity hit here (~21, sayeth Duck). Missed NICE and ICE in row 3. I really wanted an S (ALGERINE, FAQIR hooks; he might not be sure of ALGERINES) and there was nothing worth keeping that wouldn't be easy to draw back. Too much of a panic play in hindsight.

#note So frustrating that VOYAGEUR was one space from fitting... Not a good play. I had Peter under a minute and, given his rack, this play makes his decision easy. Would've played YOU at 1J if I'd seen it.
>Peter_Barkman: AEEINNT 5C NAI.ETE +20 338
#note Now Peter gets to put the game in a one-in-the-bag situation ... and quickly, too. Why VUG was the wrong play.
>Jason: DDEORVY 4B DEY +26 321
#note Nothing wins. Thought about fishing for OVERDID by playing the Y at 4G, but that would've killed my spread if he'd bingoed out with NINNIES. Fished for the P and it worked, but wasn't enough. Think OVERDID fish might be right, though.
