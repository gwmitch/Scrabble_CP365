#note jd: anything that doesn't have jd in front of it is conrad talking. This was at a point where conrad was threatening to run away with the tournament, in spite of being royally hung over
>JD: AFGHINU E7 F.UING +20 20
#note jd - this would've been better as an opening rack

#note jd - this was a tough play to see.

#note DURO doesn't look familiar lol. that's not good.

#note seriously sucked to see that come down.

#note jd - this is totally one of those annoying conrad plays
>JD: ABDLNNN 5E NAN. +16 269
#note jd - I would really like to block the 3x3, but that's not happening this turn

#note Y(T)TRIC.
>JD: BDELNUU B2 UN.LUED +22 291
#note jd - not sure why I wouldn't just played bulged here, but this works. keeping a scoring tile isn't so bad.

#note jd - phew
>dacrON: ?ACDIRT A7 DIT +24 244
#note Not sure if this is the right rack.
>JD: BEEEIIT B14 E. +10 328
#note jd - kind of a weird play, but I didn't want to open with zibet and I figured I would take out an easy scoring spot. quackle is not a fan. that said, I don't think I can bring myself to play zibet here with the board this closed. just exchanging and trying to pick up the blank if it's in the bag might be a better idea. on 4-ply zibet drops well behind exchanging, and even behind tihs play - but in general an exchange would make a lot of sense here. if I didn't score anything this turn then it's not like keeping most of the same tiles is going to lead to spectacular scores next turn.

>JD: BEEIITT 1E ITE. +6 334
#note jd - this is probably why I should've just exchanged last turn. but this actually sims best now.
>dacrON: ?AACIOR K9 ACAROId +71 331
#note Held, and almost released. JD was close to challenging because he was so sure it was phony. I needed the challenged to win the game, alas, it was not to be.

JD - this is a word?
>JD: BEEIIMT 15G IMBE. +24 358
#note IBI(d)EM is 11 better, but this gets the job done.

jd - best play is actually bedtime but once I saw a safe win with imbed I decided to take it. as usual, I was low on time.
