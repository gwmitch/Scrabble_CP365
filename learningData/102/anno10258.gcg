#note Mid-pack choice.  Best are apparently 9H EH and 3I HIREE.  I didn't like the DEEIR leave with EH (I always seem to draw a 3rd E whenever I leave myself that combination) and I couldn't think of HIREE, which looks like the best play out of the bunch.  This only concedes a handful of scoreboard points, but it could give back a big H1 play, which is why this sims roughly 11 points and 4% winning chances down on HIREE and EH.
>Aldo_Cardia: AIKL H1 ALIK. +42 50
>Jim_Burlant: EIMRRTY K8 .IRTY +18 68
#note Best is a play I missed, 4J OYER - matter of fact, I missed most everything.  Yuck.  Surprisingly this is the bronze medalist - wins 53%.
>Aldo_Cardia: AILV L1 VALI. +26 76
>Jim_Burlant: EJMORSU 12H JOE.S +46 114
#note Q doesn't entirely approve - I figured that 46 pionts is 46 points and that the S wasn't of much use on this board.  Q prefers 6F JO by nearly 10 points.  I'm 56% to win with this; JO ostensibly wins 61.
>Aldo_Cardia: BEI H12 .IBE +39 115
>Jim_Burlant: AIMPQRU 6F QI +36 150
#note Best - 2Q MAQUI preserves a nicer leave but needlessly slots the triple.
>Aldo_Cardia: EX G2 EX +36 151
>Jim_Burlant: AAMPRTU 1L .AMP +33 183
#note Nothing available to unload the U that doesn't sacrifice way too much on the scoreboard, and Quackle agrees.  I'm 56% to win.
>Aldo_Cardia: ENV 2K V.NE +24 175
>Jim_Burlant: AANRTUW 3L .AWN +28 211
#note Best.  Too many easy hooks (S, N) available in the unseen pool to hold onto the N.
>Aldo_Cardia: FRT 13G R.FT +23 198
>Jim_Burlant: AACGRTU F11 RUGA +16 227
#note  Glad that hook opened up - I was getting tired of looking at that U.  This is best.  
>Aldo_Cardia: OOW E9 WOO +16 214
>Jim_Burlant: AACEHOT 14J HA +27 254
#note I'd really like to unload the O and draw 3 to ACET.  HAO does better statically than this, but the board position makes it too dangerous.  After a few hundred iterations this choice percolates to the top of the two-ply sim - it's best.
>Aldo_Cardia: AB F1 AB +21 235
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEOTU 10H OUT.AnCE +67 321
#note When I put this play down, I wasn't feeling confident about the progression of this game.  Aldo had obviously been close to something for a while, and I was concerned as I put this down that I'd play for 67 and give back 80+.   The sim says OUTREACH (which I didn't think of) wins 91.6%, then 15K ACUTE, followed by any of the other bingos, of which this is one.  simn roughly 3% and 5 points down.  Fortunately for me, this led Aldo into a mistake that gave me the game.

>Aldo_Cardia: ?GILSTU --  -74 235
>Jim_Burlant: ADEMNST O6 STAM.NED +86 407
#note Luckbox!  Good thing for me Aldo phonied - I might very well have missed the 7 in this rack, which would have played at D8 for 83.
>Aldo_Cardia: ?GILSTU 15K GUILT +24 259
>Jim_Burlant: CFNORRS D11 FOR +18 425
#note Couldn't think of CORF, which would have prevented his next play, not that the game was in jeopardy.  Apparently, FRONS D11 was the play.
