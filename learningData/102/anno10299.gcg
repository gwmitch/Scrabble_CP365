#note BADIN(AGE)! grrr... Oh, how different would this game have been then?
>Will_Anderson: AE 9F AE +13 21
>Jason: AIIINSX -III +0 18
#note Duck's clear pick is IXIAS at 10B. I guess. In hindsight, should've kept an I.
>Will_Anderson: ADELORS I3 LOADERS +74 95
>Jason: ACHNNSX H2 NAH +21 39
#note H(O)NAN. Wasn't 100%.

>Will_Anderson: IIII -IIII +0 111
>Jason: CEMNPSU G1 CUP +20 85
#note If this was the first half of the tourney, Will would've dangled an open A.
>Will_Anderson: EGIORT 1A ERGOTI. +33 144

>Will_Anderson: III -III +0 144
#note This game is not living up to its billing so far, eh?
>Jason: EGINRST E8 STINGER +75 160
#note "OK," I thought. "Horrible start for you and you've still gained 16 points in seven turns. Now let's go!" Then I saw an S first tile and that pumped me up even more. But...

#note Man, I wish I'd seen BADINAGE...
>Will_Anderson: AEIT M3 TE.IA +26 279
#note At this point, I just had to laugh at the absurdity of it all.
>Jason: BEHLNOY N2 BOY +27 229
#note HEN(R)Y. Just whiffed. BE(T)ONY is also an improvement.
>Will_Anderson: EORRTUV N8 OV.RTURE +72 351
#note After the game, Will commented that he was so nervous about doing this with no blanks played. But what else? Nothing, that's what. (A math error gave Will 361 instead of 351 after this play.)

>Jason: ?AAEJNO 15A JOE +35 331
#note JO at 14J is better. Wouldn't have mattered. I needed the second blank and Will had it since OVERTURE (or maybe MIRED).

#note 11 vowels played in 14 turns. (And 12 exchanged) Owie. But congrats to Will on a well-deserved tournament win.
