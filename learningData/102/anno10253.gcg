>Carolyn_Easter: IQ H7 QI +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: BHITTUY I6 BITTY +26 26
#note Sim results indicate I was right to be annoyed with myself after I put this down.  I should have held the Y and just played BITT, as this creates a nice juicy spot to score with the Y on the next turn.
>Carolyn_Easter: EFW G8 FEW +16 38
>Jim_Burlant: AEHNOUX F9 HOAX +28 54
#note Missed the best spot here:  H10 plays are cool, and I didn't see any of them.  This isn't bad from a score standpoint, but it gives up too many easy counterplays if she can overlap.  Fortunately for me, she didn't have the rack to burn me.
>Carolyn_Easter: ISS 12D SI. +20 58
#note The second S is inferred, and Carolyn confirmed after the game that she did have the second S.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEENTU J2 ENDUE +16 70
#note Forgot about the V front hook to this, but this is only a 1-point dog to the sim winner J2 UNDEE.  Everything wins 48%.
>Carolyn_Easter: AAEIRSW -AAEI +0 58
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIPRT K5 PEATIeR +95 165
#note PERIApT is slightly better.  Whatever, they all score 95.
>Carolyn_Easter: NSZ E11 Z.N +46 104
>Jim_Burlant: EEEELNO L10 LEE +9 174
#note Best is a word I always miss, LEONE.  Scores 23 at 14A and L3, and L3 looks best.  This is lame.
>Carolyn_Easter: JOT L4 JOT +31 135
>Jim_Burlant: EEENOOS M3 EON +21 195
#note Either this or NOOSE 14B.
>Carolyn_Easter: DDO M9 ODD +13 148
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHIOS I2 HOE +18 213
#note Another word I always forget to look for, HOISE, scores 33 at 14B and is best.  This is ok, but not great.  But it led to a rather amusing sequence.
>Carolyn_Easter: AADESTU 1C AUDATES +84 232
>Carolyn_Easter: AADESTU --  -84 148
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEGIS 1C ICEBAGS +102 315
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEGIS --  -102 213
#note I knew she didn't have anything useful, so what did I have to lose by trying a potential 102-point play, even if it is silly?  Best legit play looks to be CEIBAS 1D.
>Carolyn_Easter: AADESTU H1 AT +12 160
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEGIS 14B CIGS +27 240
#note Q likes a bunch of 14B plays that preserve my S, but those don't look so good when you remember that she has the S.  At the time I played  the C and kept the B to prevent anything coming back at 15A.  But I don't need to run the sim to know that, in retrospect, I should have held the C and dumped the B, as there really isn't anything *that* dangerous in the pool she can hit me with at 15A.
>Carolyn_Easter: OW H4 WO +20 180
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEILN 13C BA. +22 262
#note If I make the better play of BIGS on my previous turn, I'd be putting down INLACEs.  Instead, no bingos play.  I was very tempted to only dump the B, but there were too many extra points available if I played off the A as well.  This is best.
>Carolyn_Easter: DKU 5E KUD. +18 198
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILLN 6A rALLINE +73 335
#note Best bingo.
>Carolyn_Easter: AGM A5 G.AM +18 216
>Jim_Burlant: ACMRUUV C3 UVU.AR +20 355
#note Forgetting the V hook on ENDUE.  VACUUM!  Regardless, the game is over except for the final score.  Even quackle says I'm winning 100.0%.
>Carolyn_Easter: AEILORS 13G ORALISE +72 288
>Carolyn_Easter: AEILORS --  -72 216
>Jim_Burlant: CFIMRVY 13K CRY +20 375
#note VACUUM would have been a sweet play, but the consolation of missing it was that I kept the C, which I could now use to kill row 13.
>Carolyn_Easter: AEILORS K13 .OL +5 221
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIMPV 15H EVI. +21 396
#note Carolyn agreed - this was quite an evil play from her perspective.
>Carolyn_Easter: AEIORST 3M .R +2 223

>Carolyn_Easter: AEIRSST 1B ATRESI.S +66 289
