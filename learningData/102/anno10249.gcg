>Jim_Burlant: CDEKLLO K7 K.OLL +18 18
#note Wasn't sure about clonked; this is very weak. CLONKED 2x2 should have been the play.
>Tasha_Asberry: AJT 7E TAJ +37 107
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEFPR 6B DECAF +39 57
#note Without an E for PREFACED, this is best, but it still only wins 21%.
>Tasha_Asberry: BEG 9E BEG +28 135
>Jim_Burlant: OOPRUYY E9 .OYO +18 75
#note Didn't know the back hook to KNOLL, which limited my options.  Couldn't think of BUOY.
>Tasha_Asberry: DEENP C2 DEEP.N +20 155
>Jim_Burlant: OPUY 12D P.YOU +22 97
#note Not sure what the other tiles in the rack were.  I recall that it had enough crap that YUP 12K wasn't viable because of leave and that I needed to turn more of the rack.  I was also hoping she'd come back through or from the U and open  up the bottom of the board.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EEORTU -?EEO +0 155
>Jim_Burlant: IMNQRTU 4A QU.RN +48 145
#note Back from 15% to 35% winning chances...but not for long.
>Tasha_Asberry: AEILNOS I5 ELA.IONS +71 226
#note Best play for Tasha - very nice find.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIMTTW H1 WITED +33 178
#note Best, but I'm in trouble - this is only winning 14%.
>Tasha_Asberry: AACEETW -AAC +0 226
>Jim_Burlant: AFMTTWZ 2F WA.F +18 196
#note Too blinded by the presence of the other W to look for my best play.  The sim likes 13F AFT; this is weak. 
>Tasha_Asberry: AO 3F OA. +12 238
>Jim_Burlant: CIIMTTZ 1D ZIT +28 224
#note Best.  Despite being down 2 bingos to zip, and despite my suboptimal play to this point, I was still very much in the game.  I could only keep drawing crap for so long before all the cruddy tiles were gone and I would draw good ones.  I was feeling confident that, as long as I could just hit one big play, I'd be able to outplay and outsmart her.  Little did I know what was coming up.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?AEIISS 5G I..AlISES +68 306
#note So what that LIAISES 13A scores 86 - can you believe someone rated under 1100 found this?  Well done, Tasha!  This play turned my head to mush. Yes, anyone can challenge you, but this was the last thing I expected.
>Jim_Burlant: BCIMRST O1 CRIB. +36 260
#note Too much of an autopilot play.  While the 36 points for this are nice, I probably should have traded points and leave for a more open board.  Despite what Quackle says (it likes this best), I should have played SCRIM O6.  This made the board too easy for her to defend.
>Tasha_Asberry: HNO 6L NOH +31 337
>Jim_Burlant: ?EHMSTU G12 .HM +12 272
#note Pretty appropriate that the best play is 8A MUSH, which I missed - her series of increasingly impressive bingos has turned my brain to mush.  I thought I was being oh-so-clever by setting up the S hook on the triple.  Little did I know what she had waiting for me.
>Tasha_Asberry: ADEGINR 14C DREA.ING +68 405
#note Small consolation:  if I'd played MUSH like I should have, she'd have still had MARGINED/MIDRANGE.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ESTUVV 10K .UV +6 278
#note Now I'm just in shock and playing like it. I still haven't noticed that S hook on DEEPEN.
>Tasha_Asberry: AAEMRRR M10 .ERA +14 419
>Jim_Burlant: ?EESTVX 8A VEST +34 312
>Tasha_Asberry: AEILMRR 13B MAE +21 440

>Jim_Burlant:  (ILRR) +8 339
#note Annotation ends here, Final score 440 - 339.  Tasha had been practically apologetic to me during the game and when she commented that she'd been incredibly lucky, I told her she'd been every bit as good as she had been lucky.  A terrific effort by the 49th seed.
