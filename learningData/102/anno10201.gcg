>Karl_Higby: APY 8G YAP +16 16
>Jason: DELRTVZ 9F VET +15 15
#note No really good options. Sims well down the list but I still like it. Doesn't offer much in the way of counterplays. ZED may be better in hindsight.
>Karl_Higby: CDO 7E COD +17 33
>Jason: DILRRTZ 10H TIRL +9 24
>Karl_Higby: HU 7I UH +11 44
>Jason: DDINRYZ E4 ZIN.Y +38 62
#note Sim says hold back the Y. If any S's had been played yet/his last play wasn't so fish-y, I might've.
>Karl_Higby: EIINO 4A IONI.E +32 76
>Jason: BDDKRSU 8A BUDD. +42 104
#note Nice embarrassment-of-riches situation. Duck prefers DUSKY, I still like this.
>Karl_Higby: AIM 3A AMI +20 96
>Jason: JKLNORS B6 JO.K +31 135
>Karl_Higby: FFI F2 FI.F +23 119

>Karl_Higby: CEENSST D8 .ESCENTS +74 193
>Jason: EGHILPW 15D .LEIGH +30 234
#note Tunnel vision on blocking the S. PHEW at K2 is fine.
>Karl_Higby: AW 14D .AW +29 222
>Jason: BGIPRSW 13A BRI.G +20 254
#note G(A)WP is gutsy yet clever. Wish I'd seen it.
>Karl_Higby: ORV 8L .RVO +21 243
>Jason: EINPQSW K3 PEW +26 280
#note No need to Q panic. UU left, and the E1 spot will almost certainly be there next turn. Plus, this sets up the case S decently.
>Karl_Higby: ?ADELNU 14I UNLADEn +73 316
>Jason: AEINQST M11 QAI. +28 308
#note So much for throwing the Q back. Time for plan B: Draw a bingo or the X into this leave.
>Karl_Higby: AX 15K AX +36 352
>Jason: EENORST 12H RESON.TE +70 378
#note And it's the former! (A five-tile play at O11 might've caused tears.)
>Karl_Higby: AEGMOOU 11A GUA.O +16 368
>Jason: AEEORT M2 ORATE +20 398
#note Close. RETEA(R) is nine better.
