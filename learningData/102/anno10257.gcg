>Marilyn_Wilkins: DOPU 8F UPDO +14 14
#note Play incorrectly scored as 12.
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIMOT 7I BOG +16 16
#note Hmmm.   In retrospect I wonder if this wasn't a little too impatient; even if she doesn't have a J, this is way too likely to give back way more than I get for it. I wonder if I should have just played B(O)G I7.   Surprisingly, Q says this is the best of a weak lot; like I said, I'm not sure I agree.  Fortunately, I don't get burned for this.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ABEL 6J BALE +25 39
>Jim_Burlant: EEIMOQT F5 TOQ.E +16 32
#note Too blinded by the Q to see the best play; EMOTE 8K scores 34 and is clearly best.  This is the best of the rest, as I can't play the Q without giving back easy hooks; I chose this because it was the only Q dump that didn't give back an easy hook on the row 11 2x2.  But EMOTE should have been the play.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AINW E3 WAIN +20 59
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIMPY L3 IMP.Y +34 66
#note Saw this and loved the cool factor.  Also - while it does give up potential S and D hooks on row 2, this does eliminate the possibility of anything to O8.   Q prefers two other plays at 5K to this:  YEP and GEY.  YEP still addles me with the G, GEY gives up a handful of scoreboard points relative to the other choices, and both of them still  allow any number of  high scoring plays at 8K.  This is the bronze medalist, winning just under 41, at a deficit of 8 points to YEP. I can sort of see Q's point, though:  given the potential front hooks to IMPLY (I only thought of the S, but it also takes a front D), this might be just as dangerous in its own right as any of the other plays I rejected.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: CEINORU N1 COENURI +81 140
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEGTX O7 DEX +36 102
#note Q is spot-on here:  while it's certaintly not horrible to score 36 and take out the O column, this was mediocre.  EXED 9H scores 43 and does a much better job clearing out this  rack.  This sacrifices 4% winning chances and roughly 8 or 9 equity to the best play, 9H EXED.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: CIRSTT 10F STRICT +33 173
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFFTT 1J AFFE.T +54 156
#note I had to get one right somewhere along the way.  Still only 31% to win in a short sim.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: NWZ 3K W.Z.N +34 207
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGGINN 2B GINsENG +77 233
#note The only bingo, winning 55% in a short sim.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: IIT K10 .ITI +8 215
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEEER 12G AERA.E +14 247
#note Wow - had no idea strict took a front A; best is E10 AREAE for 19.  Had I known that, this game would have taken a radically different course.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ADEILLR 13B DALLIER +73 288
#note Apparently Marilyn missed the ASTRICT possibility as well.  Best is E9 RALLIED for 77.  She's 67% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEJKMO 12A JOKE +59 306
#note Marilyn's comment as this came down:  "Did I even bingo just now?"  I'm 52% to win with this, the best play.  1A JAKE is also a very strong choice.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AORVY N9 OVARY +28 316
>Jim_Burlant: AELMNSU 1A LAME +31 337
#note Not thrilled to burn the E, but I had my reasons for making this play.  With all those unseen bingo prone tiles and Marilyn having just drawn 5, I thought that bingos in columns B and C were the biggest threats - even a GORDITAS airball would clinch the game for her.  I felt that I would be better off taking my chances in the end game.  Q's recommendations of M13 MU and M13 MUN preserve AELNS and AELS, but are completely insane given the unseen pool.   5I LAMP does score more than this and preserve the E, but it doesn't defend against bingos in the C or B columns.  I would make this play again.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EH 2J HE +35 351
#note Marilyn told me post-mortem that my LAME play caused her to feel pressure to stay in the game.  She, too, didn't want to burn her E, but she felt she had no choice.
>Jim_Burlant: NOOSSUV 9M V.. +17 354
#note I had 12 minutes on my clock at the beginning of this turn.  My tracking showed 2 tiles in the bag, but a check of the bag revealed one.   After burning nearly 9 minutes trying to figure out what I'd gotten wrong, Marilyn realized she'd overdrawn.  Following the overdraw procedure, I threw the I back into the bag.   I deemed V(OD)OU and V(OD)OU too reckless given the unseen pool, so I decided to take this to a one-in-the-bag situation. What I didn't know at the time was that the last tile in the bag prior to the overdraw procedure was the blank. 
>Marilyn_Wilkins: HU H1 U.H +21 372
>Jim_Burlant: INOOSSU I3 ION +10 364
#note Since I'd burned my time trying to figure out where my tracking went wrong, I gave up trying to calculate all the permutations of Marilyn's 26 possible racks.  It was obvious I didn't have a win, so I opted to set up the unblockable out in 2.   Replaying the game with knowledge that I? were the last 2 in the bag, I figured out that no matter what I did on the previous turn, I would not have had a win; the best I could figure out was a 4-point loss.  Maybe I have margin to withstand her drawing the blank if I make a better play than DEX in the early game.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ?ADRST O11 DeARS +24 396
#note MISRATED C1 is best; other out plays include any number of 9A plays (e.g.:  REDATES, TIRADES, etc.).
>Jim_Burlant: OSSU D5 SOUS +11 375
#note Due to time pressure, missed the 14 H placement for 14.  Time on my clock when this went down:  0:00.
>Jim_Burlant:  (T) +2 377
