#note this is a better rack for going second. also, ROUTH is good after all. oops.

>jd: EENORRT G9 ORE +11 21
#note QUEERER should be far and away the best play, too bad I missed it

#note she was looking at a double-double which was kinda alarming, but she couldn't find one that fit
>jd: BEINRRT B10 BR.IN +26 47
#note I didn't see buhr which is probably worth a shot by this point

#note always good to set up hooks that your opponent might not notice/know about

>jd: EIRRTTV K6 ..RIVER +24 122
#note this is a weird play. there is basically no way to end up with a decent leave. quackle recommends TIT which I don't totally understand, but only by a bit
>Andrea_Hatch: ESZ L4 ZE.S +44 186
>jd: EHOSTTT L11 TETH +20 142
#note well, now that she's blocked my bingo I'm starting to get a little nervous. there are enough Os out and few enough Es that quackle likes TROTH, and I agree. I also saw GHETTO but I really don't like setting up such a huge spot on a closed board.
>Andrea_Hatch: IO 11D OI +15 201
>jd: LMOOSTU M12 MOOL +26 168
#note I wanted to create another lane for a bingo ending in -S. playing MOO instead sims very close.

>jd: ACILSTU M2 UTA +17 185
#note christ, now what. out of this tantalizing rack I missed CHOLA at 14K which is a lot more points. this does sim alright, though. have to hope she doesn't kill me on column N next turn
>Andrea_Hatch: FNR 9J F.RN +8 233
>jd: ACEGILS G3 GLACE +29 214
#note this is a pretty big tempo mistake - I bailed on this rack sooner than I should have. Especially since I'm losing at this point I should really be looking to slow the game down - dropping the G for ZAG could really make her life tough, even though SLIT kinda suggests she has the case S.
>Andrea_Hatch: INTW 5E TW.IN +16 249
>jd: DIILPSW 14K W..P +32 246
#note I started trying to fastplay her because she had taken a long time on her last few moves.
>Andrea_Hatch: AABIL A6 LABIA +25 274
>jd: DEIILSV B5 VID +16 262
#note I had visions of hitting a -LIEST bingo, but with a vowel-heavy bag anyway I should just take the points for VIDE. quackle wants me to play DIVE at 4B to block ATWAIN, but I doubt she knows it so I should probably leave it open.
>Andrea_Hatch: FO C7 OF +11 285
>jd: AAEILNS N2 NASAL +32 294
#note under some time pressure I threw this play down to see if I could outrun her, which was probably not a good idea. quackle suggests AA at D4, again in part because it takes out ATWAIN which she likely does not know. I'm only really going to win if she trainwrecks the endgame, but against a lower-rated player that didn't seem like such a bad shot to take.

really though, it turns out that AA wins the sim because it boosts my bingo changes all the way to 40% (note that playing it at D4 takes out the G which I should keep open as a lane). I may even get to fish for a bingo twice. with that in mind, I can see why quackle prefers AA so much to NASAL.
>Andrea_Hatch: AENOT O6 ATONE +17 302
#note I have a chance! right?!
>jd: ADEEIYY I11 EYED +12 306
#note unfortunately this draw just wasn't good enough. I didn't see her out at E4 so with only 20 seconds left or so I went for the block at I11. sigh. YAY at D4 is the best play but she will unquestionably see her out.
>Andrea_Hatch: CKOS E4 S.OCK +11 313
#note well-played.
>Andrea_Hatch:  (AIY) +12 325
#note I should've lost by 7, but still, what a strange game.
