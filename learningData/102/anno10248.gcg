>Jim_Burlant: AEEGHOS G12 EH +18 50
#note No idea what to do here and I didn't want to unload both my E's.  This is the highest scoring play I have, and even though I have an S G12 EGO seems a little reckless at this stage - not to mention a little too obvious.  Best looks to be K5 AGONE or HOGAN K4.
>Jeff_Reeves: BEIL F10 BILE +27 49
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIOOS K5 GOO.IES +32 82
#note Or AGONISE.  Style preference as to whether to worry about a potential HAJ bomb and play defense with AGONISE or go for the better leave with GOONIES. This early, I'll optimize leave.
>Jeff_Reeves: ACFIM J10 MAFIC +36 85
>Jim_Burlant: AGIMPSY 13I P.GMY +32 114
#note Missing L11 PIGMY, which is best.  I was tempted to try GASPY* E9 but thought the better of it. Certainly not terrible to score 32, but this did give up a few too many points to the better options and as such, it justifiably sims mid-pack.  
>Jeff_Reeves: HI E11 HI +31 116
>Jim_Burlant: AADIPST D10 PAST +42 156
#note Again, good, but not great - PITAS D8 scores 50.  Just a little too tired to see the longer plays this morning, and it's showing in this game.  Play was scored correctly, but added as 52.  Neither of us caught the error, so I thought this put me at 166.
>Jeff_Reeves: OOWZ M9 WOOZ. +24 140
>Jim_Burlant: ADDIIOO 12L A.O +32 188
#note I was a little nervous about that N hook with 5 unseen and the hidious DDIIO leave, but 32 points is 32 points.  And when nothing else scores about 20, I can't justify trading the points for leave.  Sim says this or L2 DIDO are equally strong choices.
>Jeff_Reeves: DEEGR N6 GREED +27 167
>Jim_Burlant: ADDIIOT L2 DIDO +15 203
#note Sim says that the C 7 placement wins 1.7% more often and is 2 points better.  This is runner up. Other options worth considering are M2 OIDIA and O3 DIDO
>Jeff_Reeves: EET O8 TEE +25 192
>Jim_Burlant: AIINOTT O12 NOTA +29 232
#note  I'd normally look harder to unload one of my dupe I's, but there's only 1 left in the pool; it's unlikely that I'll draw it, so I'm not too worried about keeping II.  Having said that, NAOI (which I couldn't think of) would have been a hair better.
>Jeff_Reeves: ?LQU 3I QUa.L +46 238
>Jim_Burlant: EIINRTT N14 IT +10 242
#note It was probably a bad assumption, but I thought that Jeff had probably just split his blanks, and I didn't want to give him too easy of a line to bingo on by playing something like TI 4H.  As close as this game was I still thought I might be able to draw into something, but I wound up outsmarting myself.  Best looks to be 4H NIT.
>Jeff_Reeves: AW J5 AW +30 268
>Jim_Burlant: EILNRTV 15L VI.. +11 253
#note Really struggling - I felt that 14A plays were crazy - play for 23, give back 60 and any hope at the game.  I also seriously considered exchanging LV just to hope for a ridiculously low-probability AS draw for ANESTRI on row 4.  I felt that if I kept it close, I could still take my chances in the end game. Sim likes 4F NEVI and says that's 25% to win; this is just under 20.
>Jeff_Reeves: CEELSUV -CEE +0 268
>Jim_Burlant: AELNRST N1 LAS +20 273
#note So of course, instead of exchanging LV and leaving myself AEINRST for 77 on row 4, I now have this and have no idea what to do with it. Arrrgh!  Q likes fishing the L; on a more open board that's a no-brainer, but I didn't see the point in fishing for a bingo that wouldn't play, so I just went for score.  I didn't like the board position with this, and remember - I also thought this would put me back up to 283, not 273 points, so given the (incorrect) information I had at the time, this seemed reasonable.
>Jeff_Reeves: CRY 14B CRY +26 294
>Jim_Burlant: AENNRTV B12 VA. +8 281
#note I'm thinking I enter this turn having scored 283, and this uber defensive play brings me back within 3.  Given this pool and the unseen S? can I afford to let him have a wide open run at the O column?  
>Jeff_Reeves: EEJ 9G J.E +22 316
>Jim_Burlant: ENNORST C9 NO +7 288
#note Arrrrrgh!   The first tile out of the bag on my last draw was the S - I couldn't believe it.  I saw the 14 points for ON at O1 but those don't do me a whole lot of good - I've got to open the board up and hope for a good draw.  I'm back up from 5 to 22% winning chances.
>Jeff_Reeves: DELU B7 DUEL +16 332
>Jim_Burlant: ENNRSTU A6 RENTS +33 321
#note Q wants me to fish for a bingo - I kinda thought it was pointless given the unlikelihood that the bingo would play.  Apparently EN A7 wins 37% and this only wins 9. Given that IR were left in the bag, everything wins 0.  Again, remember I also thought I entered this turn at 298, so this brought it back to a 1-point game, or so we thought.

>Jim_Burlant: INRU I3 .I +11 332
>Jeff_Reeves: ?ANRT 5A bRANT +13 363
#note Not sure where we misadded, but final score recorded as 359 - 342, Jeff's win.
