#note wanted to block off TWS, board is pretty shite otherwise.  AWA does sim best, about 1.5 pts better than the next play.

#note well, I was REALLY pissed when I first drew this rack, until Liz played her bingo and I saw there were no vowels in the bag...so basically what I am trying to do here is play only a few tiles at a time, while slowly blocking off the Z and Q spots.  I guess trying to draw the Z is worth something too, KINA sims way better.
