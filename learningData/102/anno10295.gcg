#note JET(LI)NER is cute.

#note Heh, (LIB)ERTINE.
>Larry_Sherman: IO I7 O.I +7 38
>Jason: AEEINRT 12F .NERTIAE +68 88
#note Given Larry's prior play, I'll forgo the four points for ARENITE/T(WO) to give him vowels to play through and block the T.
>Larry_Sherman: EX 13L EX +38 76
>Jason: ?AHIPRT 11J AH +22 110
#note HARPIsT and PHIlTRA. Knew there was something here, just couldn't find it and had to give up the ghost. Damn.
>Larry_Sherman: DIMN H11 D.NIM +24 100
>Jason: ?AFIPRT 10J FAR +34 144
#note FA or FAT are preferred, says Duck. Surprised; kind of like the other -T hook and not setting up an S. No way I can play PaRFAIT here.
>Larry_Sherman: LOU 13C LOU. +8 108
>Jason: ?GIOPTT B7 POTTInG +67 211
#note Making my decision of which T to hook to WO moot. (POTTINGS* isn't even Collins, as it turns out.)
>Larry_Sherman: EEJ A8 JEE +61 169
>Jason: AEENTVZ D12 Z.NE +28 239
#note ZETA or VET at C6. Shouldn't have played to bingo myself; never too early to start controlling the board.
>Larry_Sherman: GIR C6 RIG +21 190
>Jason: AEERTVW 15A WAV. +30 269
>Larry_Sherman: AKNT 5C TANK +21 211
>Jason: EEFNRST 7H S.FTENER +64 333
#note "One shot at happiness," as Marlon said to me in the early bird when he opened a trip-trip with his high-scoring play.
>Larry_Sherman: DDEIOV O4 OVE.DID +39 250
>Jason: DEHLOOS 8L HOL. +25 358
>Larry_Sherman: ABLY F2 BAL.Y +28 278
>Jason: CDEEOOS 15F CO.E +8 366
#note Overthought this. Figured I could outrun eights through BALKY but not from the M.
>Larry_Sherman: AMPY 4D PA.MY +42 320
#note But not if he scores 42 to dump clunk before he bingos, genius. ODE(A) looks smarter in hindsight.
>Jason: ADEOSSS D7 AS +21 387
>Larry_Sherman: EGR H1 GRE. +24 344
#note Figured a U fish was coming. Larry probably figured even if he hit, I could easily block everything.
>Jason: DEORSSU 1H .OURDES +11 398
#note SU(B)O(R)DERS! lol And apparently I forgot GREY takes an -S. Only -3 to those plays, though, -5 to ROUSERS.
