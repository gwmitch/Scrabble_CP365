>jsp: IORSTVY 8G TIVY +20 20
#note It's close among several options here. 8H IVORY 30 scores best, but breaks up some good tiles. I like 8H IVY best, leaving ORST.
>moh: CEEEIRT I7 E.E +8 8
#note I saw I2 ERECTI(V)E 66, but I thought I was making things up, and I had a feeling you'd know such a word if it existed. I should have been braver. My E(V)E sims next best.
>jsp: ?EIORST 10F STORIEd +67 87
#note Tons of bingos, none outstanding.
>moh: ACEIMRT L3 TIMECAR. +74 82
#note The only bingo.
>jsp: EGILLNO 6D LEGION +19 106
#note The top two plays include a fish (K4 LO 14) and the highest-scoring play possible (H10 (O)LINGO).
>moh: EGLNOSU 5J GU. +12 94
#note 5J GU(M) wins the sim. There just aren't any plays that score, so why not fish?
>jsp: AAADELQ K3 AQ.A +28 134
#note You weren't kidding about my play being fortuitous! Glad to help!
>moh: BEHLNOS 3J B..H +18 112
#note B(AT)H is best.
>jsp: ADEFLNY 5B FLAY +32 166
#note N2 LEAFY 48 is best, making you a 4-1 favorite. Play is thirrd-best, making you a 3-1 favorite.
>moh: EJLNOST 11E JO +20 132
#note Pouting about the J killing my bingo chances, I missed 4A JOES for 51. Keep your head in the game, Hodge!
>jsp: DEEMNRR 4D DERM +28 194
#note Best.
>moh: DELNOST 12D DOL +20 152
#note B2 TEN(F)OLDS 78. Embarrassing, really.
>jsp: ENNNPRT 13E TERN +19 213
#note N2 PENT 22 sims best.
>moh: EHNNSST H1 HENS +33 185
#note Best.
>jsp: CEFNNPU 7C FEN +22 235
#note 2B UNFENC(E) 28 is cool.
>moh: EIKNRST N2 REKNITS +86 271
#note Best among several bingo options.
>jsp: ACIINPU H12 U.CI +21 256
#note I like your play; Quackle prefers 14C UNAI 24.
>moh: AEEIOWW O8 OWE +24 295
#note Best.
>jsp: AADNPUZ N10 PANDA +38 294
#note Best.
>moh: AEILOOW O13 OWE +26 321
#note Best.
>jsp: DOSUUXZ M13 UDO +23 317
#note UDO is among the best plays. K10 (E)XODUS is nice, but sims behind UDO.
>moh: AABILOR O3 RIA +24 345
#note Pretty much all of the other options hook JOT-A and are subject to big responses with the X or Z. I almost played something like 14B BOLA, but just couldn't risk VOX, ZAX, etc. My RIA is the best play that avoids that area (and sims well).
>jsp: ISTUVXZ C11 ZIT +29 346
#note 2F VI(E) 14 wins the sim, but it's hard to justify sacrificing so much in score at this point.
>moh: ?ABGLOP 2B rOPABL. +32 377
>jsp: AISUVX 14B VISA +38 384
#note K10 (E)XUVIA 32 doesn't quite eke out the win, but it's the best you can do.
>moh: G 15L G. +5 382
