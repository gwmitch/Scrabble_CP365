#note Nice find, Duck.  It's gonna be an uphill battle.
>Dave: ADEFINT E10 FID +25 52
#note FA in the same spot might be a touch better than this.  I didn't like breaking the rack up with FIATS 6B.  I liked even less the frustrating process of scanning the board to see if I had any bingos that fit.  (I don't.)
>Kwak: CDEILNU 6D UN.LICED +78 164
#note Of course after my bingo doesn't fit, the frakkin' duck has to hit me with another.  Oh yeah, nice play.
>Dave: AEFNRTY D11 FAERY +43 95
#note FAY gives up too many points.  Can't be afraid of opening the board when you're down.
>Kwak: BEEINPT C13 BE +18 182
>Dave: EHINOTU 15D .OUTHEN +39 134
#note I thought the extra six points were definitely worth doing this instead of YOUTH, especially since there are lots of E's and N's and blanks to be drawn.  The increased chance of drawing the X for an easy 52 was also a selling point in its favor.
>Kwak: ?EINPRT K9 PTERINs +79 261
#note You gotta be frakkin' kiddin' me.  And it didn't even put the R where I could use it.

#note *sigh*
>Dave: ABEIIMS 2J .AMBE +32 196
#note IMAUMS D3 is a really cute play that might be better than mine, but at least I can hope to draw into something on the O column.

#note Missing IONISE N9, but at this point can you blame me?
>Kwak: ?LOTUXY 6M OXY +57 484
>Dave: AIOQRST N8 TRA.QS +31 289
#note I suppose I should play QI L8 on the off chance the dumb duck leaves the triple-triple open.  Then I could make it look like I lost a close game.  Instead I played to end the misery quickly.
>Kwak: ?EELNTU 1K NU +10 494
>Dave: AIILOOS O5 S.LI +34 323
#note I briefly considered playing the euthanizing OLIOS B10 and started looking for a good out in two.  Then I found these two high scoring endgame plays, which I'm guessing do better than any continuation in which I go out first.  Feel free to try to prove me wrong, if you're really bored.
