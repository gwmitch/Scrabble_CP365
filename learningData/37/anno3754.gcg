#note Pretty nice play that I would've never found.

#note I like trading here.  There's still a few scary scenarios that can occur.
>Opponent: ?AEINOZ M4 OxAZINE +83 272
#note And the game changes drastically in one turn.  Ouch.

#note Remember how I said it's just about over?  Well, yeah.  It is now.

#note Although line i looks enticing, it's simply not good enough to work.  Even TIDE, Quackle's initial favorite breaks down with extensive simming.

#note Oh Quackle, you're so adorable.

#note This play is insanely bad.
>Kenji: EEINRSU 15G .ENSER +42 320
#note This play is pretty tough, but I think I can pretty well imply I'm not against the blank at this point.  Also if I can even just hit the X I have a good chance against Quackle's insanity at this point.  He pretty much has to have something close to what he does have... his range here is very small.
