>Jason_Idalski: BCDDFIP 8G FIB +16 16
#note Q slightly prefers exchanging leaving C. (-0.2)
>Jeff_Clark: EEFGHVZ 9H FEH +20 20
>Jason_Idalski: ACDDIPT 10I DIPT +22 38
#note Another slight error, missing DIDACT in the same spot. (-1.0)
>Jeff_Clark: ?EGSSVZ -GZVS +0 20
>Jason_Idalski: AACDDOO 7F CODA +30 68
#note Chuck will kill me for using the C for a measly three extra, but ahead I wanted to make the board ugly. Won the battle, lost the war. (-1.1)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEELRS L3 EARLiES. +66 86
>Jason_Idalski: AADHKLO K4 KOALA +33 101
#note Happy to see this five-overlap play.
>Jeff_Clark: BCEELOT M1 CELEB +34 120
>Jason_Idalski: DEHIPUU 1M .UP +21 122
#note Best, surprisingly to me.

>Jeff_Clark: AIOORTX F4 OTI. +8 192
>Jason_Idalski: EINRSTY -Y +0 237
#note Almost played (E)YE at M12 until I noticed the dramatic E shortage. In hindsight, (O)Y or Y(O) instead would've been better. Q's pick is (E)YER. (-11.5)
>Jeff_Clark: AAMOORX E4 MAX +41 233
>Jason_Idalski: EEINRST 13E TRIENES +68 305
>Jason_Idalski: EEINRST --  -68 237
#note A remarkably poor time to brain fart on a four. Stunningly, passing actually finishes ahead of a lot of Speedy's choices. However, it's forgetting that Jeff knows my rack and "what to watch out for," as he said. Fishing with I(RE) or E(RE) is best. (-12.6)
>Jeff_Clark: AAIOORR -AIOOR +0 233
>Jason_Idalski: EEINRST 14M E.. +3 240
#note In hindsight, I(RE) because of the E shortage and I abundance. This mistake was emphasized when I drew an I. (-6.6)
>Jeff_Clark: AJOQRTT 15K JOT +13 246
#note Um, can somebody start looking for that panic button?
>Jason_Idalski: EIINRST O1 ..RI +7 247
#note It's hard to take Quackle seriously from this point onward. It's not taking opponent's rack knowledge into effect. FWIW, (S)I at 9L leads. (-0.6)
>Jeff_Clark: AGQRTVY G3 QAT +30 276
>Jason_Idalski: EIILNST H3 IN +21 268
#note Did I miss SLIT or SNIT? Must've, 'cause they seem obvious now. (-4.6)
>Jeff_Clark: GIOORVY 2H GOY +19 295
#note Thought for sure Jeff had an A here.
>Jason_Idalski: AEILSST 1H AS +23 291
#note Maybe TA(XI) here? Problem is, he blocks and hits row 1 whenever he wants. This is bad because I can pull off a Z stick with something like LAS. SIAL leads sim. (-10.9)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AIORVZ 1G Z.. +12 307
>Jason_Idalski: EILRSTV 3G ..S +17 308
#note Somehow, I can win more than a quarter of the time afer this play. Search me as to how.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AIORSV 11M A.S +13 320
>Jason_Idalski: EILORTV 9L .I +3 311
#note Or (S)O or (U)T. They're very close in sim. Probably because they're the only three valid plays. Win % at 22?
>Jeff_Clark: ?GIORRV 6J G.. +8 328
>Jason_Idalski: ELNORTV L12 .N +2 313
#note Eh? U(T) wins 66% of the time while this wins 17%? Is Ducky going batty or am I missing something? (-4.3)
>Jeff_Clark: ?IORRUV -  +0 328
#note Jeff could play (UN)c(O) and still stick me with all seven. 64.9 equity loss? Thanks for trying to make me feel better, Quackle, but 164.9 is more like it. This loss will be a stain on my psyche for a little while, esp. if it has '10 BAT Premier ramifications.
