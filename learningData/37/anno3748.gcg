#note He didn't put the R in the right spot.
>Sam: BEILOWZ H4 ZOWI. +27 55
#note I still think WIZ 7H has a lot of merit, but I went with ZOWIE, which sims better. Curious to see who would pick WIZ. I'm not sure if the point and leave sacrifices are worth it.

#note AXE is a nice play I didn't consider.
>Mark_Fidler: IQS J2 QIS +46 84
>Sam: BDEHORT C9 B.OTH +26 112
#note BO clearly sims better, but I'm not so sure about it. It is more defensive than BOOTH, planning on punishing any C9 plays. Still, I don't mind BOOTH at all. He doesn't necessarily have another S after QIS.

#note Not sure of this play at all, but I thought it was time for desparate measures. Sims as well as anything else. I considered GRIM, which gives long-shot possibilities in addition to cutting spread during the losses.

#note Champ Player likes MANY, which leave the L line open a little I guess. It's a shame I got a free shot at columns KLM and row 11 from Mark and didn't hit any of them.
>Mark_Fidler: AEEIR N5 AERIE +11 319
#note Looks like AERIES L8 would have sealed this one up.
>Sam: ABIILMN D6 IM. +7 288
#note Probably should have cut spread by now, but he's left lanes open two straight turns--why not give him another chance? I couldn't see anything ending in -LA but maybe there was something. Champ Player's is BIMA, but it must be miscalculating something, because it's win% is NOT 20-something.

#note I was going to try CABALING*. NICAD B6 is 18(!) points better.
