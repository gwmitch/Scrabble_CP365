>Jason: EGHIIOS 8G HI +10 10
#note Interesting opening rack. Q likes GHI (8H, 8F, 8G), but I figured the EGIOS leave was four better than the EIOS leave. (-5)
>George_Viebranz: EEMT 9D TEEM +19 19
>Jason: EEGIIOS 7E EGO +14 24
#note My E obsession gets me here. The obvious OGEE at 8A is preferred by Duck. (-7)
>George_Viebranz: ERRTU 8A TRUER +24 43
>Jason: EIIILRS -II +0 24
#note I just don't think LI(R)I is worth the six points. (-5)
>George_Viebranz: OX 7B OX +36 79
>Jason: CEEILRS A8 .RISCELE +89 113
#note Or TIERCELS.
>George_Viebranz: EEFJ I7 JEFE +32 111
>Jason: EGKNNVV -GKNVV +0 113
#note Keeping E and keeping EGN, along with this, sim closely.
>George_Viebranz: ADD B13 DAD +20 131
>Jason: BBEINOY 11A .NOBBY +26 139
#note Right tiles, wrong play. NOBBY at J10, which I considered, is Q's pick. (-1)
>George_Viebranz: GY 13A ..GY +18 149
>Jason: AAEEINW 12D AA +24 163
>George_Viebranz: Q -Q +0 149
>Jason: EEINOSW H10 WOE +12 175
#note I ran sim giving George the blank ... W(OR)E, which I almost played, leads. Maybe blow it up with NEWSIE? Or better yet, NOWISE (which I didn't know)? (-7)
>George_Viebranz: ?AEGILN 13H sEALING +72 221
>Jason: AEILNQS 12L QI +46 221
>George_Viebranz: AOZ J5 AZO +41 262
>Jason: AAELNOS K4 ALA +21 242
#note I just don't think I can justify getting rid of the E here, even if it is 12 more. NAE and ALAE are Q's picks. (-3)
>George_Viebranz: APRT L3 TRAP +33 295
>Jason: EIINOST 2I INOSITE +75 317
>George_Viebranz: ?DIMORS 1C nIMRODS +82 377
#note George has two trip-trips available, but I don't think I would've seen either. Heck, I'm not sure I would've seen this.
>Jason: DEINPTU 1M PUD +33 350
>George_Viebranz: CHT D1 .TCH +18 395
>Jason: EFIKNTV J12 K.F +18 368
#note I could rue the FKV draw here, but truth is it was a FKNV draw. In my fervent hope to get the S, I overdrew. Perhaps silly to bank my hopes on getting the S on a two-tile pick, but I figured it was my best chance to win. Naturally, an equity hemorrhager, to (WE)FT at 10H. CP says right idea, wrong place. F(IN)K opens up two lanes. Since the S was in the bag, I think I played it right. (-6)
>George_Viebranz: ARUW 3F WAUR +13 408
>Jason: EINNOTV O1 ..NOTIVE +39 407
#note Earning a "nice play," but as I said, "it falls under the 'too little, too late' category."
>George_Viebranz: ILNSUV 15G LUVS +32 440
>Jason: N 10H ..N +8 415
#note Glad to see I played very well in this one.
>Jason:  (IN) +4 419
