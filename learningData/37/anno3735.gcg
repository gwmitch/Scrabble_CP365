>Rob_Robinsky: ?CIIIOT 8F IdIOTIC +72 72
#note This was a no-brainer....nyuk nyuk nyuk.
>Winter: EINNOUZ K6 UN.ONIZE +84 84
#note He needs an I, and I give him three.  D'oh.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEJMTVY 12I MA.Y +36 108
#note Speaking of idiotic, how did I miss VEEJAY?  Terrible play.  J(I)VY cleans up the rack for a decent score, though there are a lot of cheap points on the board for Winter to take.  TAM L11 is an interesting option, as drawing an I or a U will often lead to 37 points and JIVY/JIVEY is likely to still be available. (-16.4)
>Winter: AAEFIWX J4 WAX +54 138
#note Yikes.
>Rob_Robinsky: EGJPTTV -GJPTV +0 108
#note I always find it gratifying when Quackle agrees with my exchanges.
>Winter: ABEFILU 13C FIBULAE +83 221
#note Okay Winter, you can stop now.  Seriously.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ENNNRT 14K RENT +26 134
#note Well, the exchange yielded a blank, but three Ns to go with it kinda bites.  Quackle is split between RENT and NINE D12.  I need volatility, yes, but not *that* much volatility.  Besides, Quackle doesn't view an E in the triple lane the same as a human does, especially with a large lead.
>Winter: EMOOSSV 15G MOVES +49 270
#note The tiles that would help me get back into the game are finding their way out of the bag and on to the board...my prospects keep getting dimmer.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AAFLNN 14D FAN +21 155
#note The Duck agrees, and rates my chances of winning at a robust 5.5%.
>Winter: ELORSSU O11 LOUSE +23 293
#note Another S?  Assuming that Winter has a second on his rack, my eventual blank bingo isn't likely to make up much ground.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AAAGLN N5 gALANGA +65 220
#note Quackle thinks MALANGA is equal here, but I disagree.  While MALANGA potentially allows me to make up more ground next turn, it also allows Winter to negate my bingo much more easily.  The Duck also can't estimate the human element...it's possible that Winter could challenge GALANGA now, or later if I have occasion to fish off an L for GALANGAL.  Then again, if I'm going under the assumption that there's a nonzero chance that he'll challenge GALANGA, I have to assume he might challenge MALANGA as well.
>Winter: EOQRRSS 12D ROSE +30 323
#note OMFG ANOTHER S!!!
>Rob_Robinsky: AEEHORW O6 HOWE +54 274
#note Back within striking distance...kind of.
>Winter: IOPQRSY 7F QI +25 348
>Rob_Robinsky: ABDEGPR 15A PAGE +32 306
#note I'd like GAPE a little bit more if I had either an I or the N...without them, I felt that I needed to assume that Winter may have them.  Anyway, I've come back to the point where I once again have to consider how to try to limit his scoring chances.
>Winter: DEOPRSY 4H YO.ED +32 380
>Rob_Robinsky: BDELNOR H1 BOD. +30 336
#note Tossup between BODY and DOBY.  I like BODY a bit better because it keeps the B and D as realistic bingo lanes...DOBY forces me to end in B, which isn't good.
>Winter: PRRSTTV 2G P.RT +8 388
#note It's a bit surprising that Winter's experiencing a vowel drought, given the pool...but if it slows him down, I'm all for it.
>Rob_Robinsky: DEKLNRT I7 D.RK +12 348
#note Quackle doesn't really know what to do with this position, at least not definitively.  Inferring that Winter has the last S makes DORK rise to the top by a bit, which doesn't take into account the inference that he is short on vowels.  Taking out the O ideally complicates his choices.  After I made this play, Winter commented that my play would look a lot better at the end of the game, because he did indeed draw more consonants.  As it turns out, though, he was even more prescient than he realized.
>Winter: CGRRSTV -GRTV +0 388
>Rob_Robinsky: EIILNTT 3A INTITLE. +75 423
#note Quackle settled pretty quickly on the bingo here.  I, on the other hand, agonized on this play.  I have to expect that whatever Winter exchanged will make its way onto my rack, and he likely improved his rack as well.  On the other hand, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to bingo again, and there aren't any reasonable scoring plays other than the bingo.  Call this the Hail Mary from deep in the endzone, trying to get back to midfield.
>Winter: ACDEJRS A1 CA.D +27 415
#note The first Hail Mary worked...now for the touchdown.
>Rob_Robinsky: GHIRTUV 10C TUGHRI. +23 446
#note Block the outplay and guarantee my own next turn.  I took my clock down to 11 seconds here because for four minutes I couldn't find either of my outplays.
>Winter: EEJRS G6 R.. +2 417
#note Winter missed my other spot and thought he could V-stick me.  Otherwise, JETES is the play.
>Rob_Robinsky: V H13 .V. +6 452
