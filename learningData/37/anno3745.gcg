>Ian_W: CEENP 8D PENCE +24 24
>Hebdomad: AAEHIIO 7H OHIA +13 13
#note Slightly worse than a number of exchanges.  Lately I've been fighting through more often than I had in the past.
>Ian_W: OX 6I OX +55 79
#note Guess I should have exchanged.
>Hebdomad: ABDEIIN 8K ABIDE +35 48
>Ian_W: EGOW N6 WO.GE +20 99
>Hebdomad: IIMNQRU 10J QUIR. +34 82
#note Decently sets up the IMN I'm keeping.

>Ian_W: ADLRSW O10 DRAWLS +49 176
>Hebdomad: AAELNNT O1 ANNATE +26 141
#note Big play here.  ANNATE is phony, it's one of those sticky S words.  Ian was pretty sure of that, but didn't challenge.  I didn't realize that, and should have played LANATE...or the cool extension!
>Ian_W: GIIKRS 3I GRISKI. +28 204
>Hebdomad: ELORUUV 13K VROU. +22 163
>Ian_W: ?ABIIOT F1 lIBATIO. +65 269
#note I'm feeling rather doomed here.  If I take the points with YELLED, that UU is going to kill my bingo chances next turn.
>Hebdomad: DEELUUY 1D DU.LY +30 193
>Ian_W: EITY D1 .EITY +18 287
>Hebdomad: ?DEELSU C8 SEcLUDE +76 269
#note Yeah DLS? draw!  Better than the row 15 plays, I think...I need the volatility.  C'mon case S!
>Ian_W: CEOO 5B CO.O.E +22 309
#note Think about what you'd play with my rack here.  One play really stands out; I'm pleased I handled this one correctly.
>Hebdomad: EEHLSTV B2 VET.H +42 311
#note Why VETCH instead of SHELVE?  ELS is to some extent insurance against overly crappy draws, And there isn't much worry about opp. playing short and making me empty the bag--there aren't short good plays here.  Finally, row 15 is mine for the taking next time...opp. can figure out if he wants to block.
>Ian_W: AJN 14B J.AN +22 331
#note Went through all the combos; my FGPT draw was just bad enough to do me in, unless opp. makes an error.  Can you find several out-sequences that lead to 1 or 2 point losses?  Should be straightforward, and not tough.
>Hebdomad: EFGLPST 12A PL.G +20 331
#note Opted for a play he might have not expected, even though I was technically blowing an equity point.  Was hoping that the flexible EFST leave might make his misuse his some of his last 80 seconds.
>Ian_W: AAEFNOR 15A FORA +44 375
#note !! Missing AFORE at A6, the only winner.  He saw AFAR there, but that loses by 1.  FORA wins only if SECLUDE takes an R, and I knew it did not.
>Ian_W: AAEFNOR --  -44 331
>Hebdomad: EFST A6 EFTS +26 357
