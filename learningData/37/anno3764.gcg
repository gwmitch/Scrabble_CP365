>Jason: AEEIIRZ 8D ZAIRE +48 48
#note The first six I looked at were AEEIIR and it looked like AERIE for 12. The Z saved the rack.
>Brian_Bowman: AAH 9C AAH +23 23
#note The frustrating thing about this loss was that second place was not only $50, but a Certificate Of Non-Dominant Outstanding Mastery (or something like that). I missed my chance to get a CONDOM from George! (I know, I know, I'm so juvenile...)
>Jason: EILOPRT 7H POITREL +65 113
#note The first thing I saw was PILOTER*, and my brain correctly went "not PILOTER*, but POITREL." However, it should've included POLITER, which is better for a few reasons. (-1)
>Brian_Bowman: AQU 6J QUA +67 90
#note Such as: It would've stopped this.
>Jason: EFGJSTT 5K JET +43 156
#note But the 43 coming back is a nice consolation prize.
>Brian_Bowman: AEMW 4L WAME +36 126
>Jason: AEFGMST 3M FEM +36 192
#note We'd already burned through a decent amount of E's, which worried me. Still, I never figured on this being the last one I'd get. Debated between this and FAG at 8M (missed the 10B placement). This wins sim.
>Brian_Bowman: EF 2N FE +31 157
>Jason: AGINSST 8L STAG +31 223
#note I hate, hate, hate, HATE -INGS words!!! Yes, LASTINGS, EASTINGS and SLATINGS are all good. I didn't have enough confidence in either. Then I miss the nice (FEM)S fish besides. My losing play. I suck. (-27)
>Brian_Bowman: ?CIORST F7 b.STROIC +74 231
#note This may well be the stupidest word I've ever seen.
>Jason: INORRSU D7 I..R +13 236
#note No good options. Glad to see this lead sim by a decent margin.
>Brian_Bowman: ACDELLV 13C CAV.LLED +82 313
#note If this was basketball, I'd have called a desperately needed timeout. Noticing that Brian had played two consecutive C bingos, I noted: "Chuck has taught you well, I see."
>Jason: NORSSUY 6B NOSY +23 259
#note I probably should've taken more time with this play. I'm not enamored with Q's picks of YOURN or YOUS or YOURS at 12I, though. (-12)
>Brian_Bowman: ABDEGO 12I BODEGA +27 340
>Jason: DDHORSU 11J HOD +30 289
#note Ooh, HO(A)RD! Wish I'd seen it. (-5)
>Brian_Bowman: BGNU 5E BUNG +28 368
>Jason: DINORSU H1 DOIN. +24 313
#note Or RUING or UNRIG. (-2)
>Brian_Bowman: AEUV 4B UVEA +22 390
>Jason: IILRSUX O1 R...X +42 355
#note Another play I'm glad to see sim best. Considered (L)UX at H13 or O(X) at C6.
>Brian_Bowman: OY G1 OY +13 403
>Jason: IIILSTU -IIU +0 355
#note Now it gets interesting. If McCarthy beats Pete, I simply need to keep the spread of this game within 124 to win the tourney. I have about 11 minutes left, Brian about three. Pete played CORTE(G)ES, Kevin held for a while and accepted, playing JERKIE(R) to go up by about 20. Pete had AAEOR and it looked over, but I thought I'd wait to see what happened. By now, I'd decided on passing IIU if I needed to win, SUIT at O12 to limit spread. Pete made an unbelievable AR(E)AE play for 31 (all overlaps) to win. So now my clock has dwindled to about six minutes. On the bright side, all the best plays are exchanges. Maybe pass more? Brian's last play indicates he doesn't have the blank (he drew it after OY). Keeping S is the valuation leader. (-14)
>Brian_Bowman: ENP N6 P..NE +15 418
>Jason: ILNOSTT B6 .OT +3 358
#note Time to give up the ghost, right? Not Mr. Stubborn! Somehow, this leads sim with about a 12% chance to win. I was hoping to draw U? and play INSULTs at 14H, or I? for INSTILl in both spots. CP likes SLOT at O12 (note that Brian plays EsURIENT to win by enough) or D12 plays like T(A)IL. (-26)
>Brian_Bowman: ?EEINRU A8 UtERINE +77 495
>Jason: IILNSTW 10H WIST +23 381
#note (T)WITS or (T)WINS are two better. Now I get the high-point tile and can't play down column O. Unbelievable how badly it snowballed after missing the bingos on turn 5.
