>Jeremiah_Mead: CEEOO 8D COOEE +20 20
>Sam: HNORRTV G3 THROV. +17 17
#note Bad miss of THORN 7F here. I feel like I would have found it had I been at full focus and not tired from not much sleep/late playing time.
>Jeremiah_Mead: AEMT H1 TEAM +39 59
>Sam: AAFNRUW F5 AW +28 45
>Jeremiah_Mead: ??AESUY 1H .rEASUrY +80 139
>Sam: AAFLNRU D8 .ARFUL +22 67
#note FA seems so obvious now, I'm surprised that I didn't play it. If I'm going to go this route I might as well play CANFUL. 
>Jeremiah_Mead: HINP M1 .NHIP +20 159
>Sam: AAEINOT 10B AE.ATION +62 129
>Jeremiah_Mead: JO E4 JO +24 183
>Sam: EGIOSUX 2J XI +52 181
#note EXIGUOUS 12A looked nice for a second.
>Jeremiah_Mead: CEINR H10 .RCEIN +33 216
>Sam: BEEGOSU L4 BUG +24 205
#note The sim likes the other option I considered, BULGE 13B. I thought I could weather the worse leave due to the consonant-heavy pool and open consonants (C, N). Another possibility is BOGUS L4. I don't really know which of the three to play.

>Sam: EEEIOSW F1 EWE +17 222
>Jeremiah_Mead: ABGLR 1A GARBL. +36 286
>Sam: EEFIOSS 14A FOES +26 248
#note EFFS 11B sims best, with FEE C9 and then FOES following behind. FEE seems like a pretty clear choice to me for some reason.
>Jeremiah_Mead: AY 15A AY +35 321
>Sam: EINNSSV C1 .IVEN +16 264
#note Best play looks like either VIS J12 or probably VAN B9 to me. Choosing RIVEN over VAN was a huge mistake, esp. after the first two I drew were GL. 
>Jeremiah_Mead: DEEINOP B4 OEDIPE.N +69 390
>Sam: GKLLNSS 4L ..LK +15 279
>Jeremiah_Mead: ORT A7 TOR +25 415
>Sam: DGLNSST 6E T..S +17 296
#note A ridiculously long Champ Player likes WOTS 6F, with a valuation of 103.6. Bizarre. This seems obviously better.
>Jeremiah_Mead: DIIRTUZ 6J ZI. +33 448
#note DIN I8 is nine points better.
>Sam: DGILMNS K5 S.DLING +46 342

#note Missed MI 2B for two more points apparently.
