>NigelP: EILNOSU 8F ELUSION +66 66
>Hebdomad: AEGRSVX F7 V.X +13 13
#note Sacrificing 9 points hoping like heck to hit the bingo next turn.
>NigelP: BEIRRST K8 .RBITERS +70 136
>Hebdomad: ABEGLRS 15D GARBLES. +89 102
#note Whew.  Sure feels like I'm losing by more than 34.
>NigelP: AEIMTW 14I WA.TIME +37 173
#note I like this kind of fearless play.
>Hebdomad: DINOPRT O11 ROP.D +27 129
#note My one mistake of the game.  I wanted to keep IN for sure, for possible bingos the next turn.  But OPTED (keeping INR) is way better than ROPED (keeping INT).  I don't care for a longer play, like DIOPTER.
>NigelP: OUY 10K .UOY +17 190
>Hebdomad: AAAEINT 7E A.A +10 139
#note Lots of places to play off two A's, but doing it this way increases bingo chances next turn.
>NigelP: DEU 13G DUE +14 204
>Hebdomad: AEIJNTU 10B JAUNT +46 185
#note Bye-bye bingo rack.  But 46 points isn't shabby at all.
>NigelP: AE 9E A.E +17 221
>Hebdomad: EFINOPT 11A POINT +33 218
>NigelP: ?CCDEIO 6G DOCEtIC +68 289
#note I wonder if he saw the higher scoring bingo?  He may have, and then opted for the more defensive play.
>Hebdomad: EFFHNWY M3 WEN.H +34 252
#note I'll probably never be this excited again to keep FFY (given the setup on column D).
>NigelP: EK 13M KE. +34 323
>Hebdomad: ?EFFRYZ C9 Z..RE +48 300
#note Well, if you like FFY, you might also like FFY?, especially after banking 48 points.
>NigelP: GV 4L V.G +14 337
>Hebdomad: ?AFFHQY D4 QuAFF +56 356
>NigelP: AIM E3 AIM +27 364
>Hebdomad: AGHLNOY A11 .HYLA +51 407
#note Or PHONY in the same spot.  Out-bingo-ed 3-1, but well positioned high pointers have more than made up the deficit.
>NigelP: EIILNOR 3E .I +2 366
>Hebdomad: EGLNNOR 2F LONGER +15 422
#note Best.  Blocks possible bingo, leaves good chance of playing out next turn, and gives opponent little in return.
>NigelP: EIIOSTT 12A .E.S +30 396
>Hebdomad: DNO 9M DON +16 438
#note I could have played out for 17 instead.  Damn you, elusive equity point!
>Hebdomad:  (TIIOT) +10 448
