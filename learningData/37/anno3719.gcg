#note GAIJIN is actually worth considering as I can imply no S.  However, there are blanks and it's not worth the gamble as my position is so good right now.
>Opponent: BEELOOO K3 EBOO. +22 101
>Kenji: AEIINNR L2 ANI +16 202
#note This is really tough.  I have no idea where my opponent is here.  NARINE seems to create a long term problem though short term it seems to work quite nicely.  ANI seems okay.

#note This one's over.  I get lazy and miss WEIGHMAN this turn and then destroy the endgame, but I'm pretty sure both are easy finds if it mattered.
