#note Got a hook letter for YOWE! Let's not play it for a few turns to keep things interesting. 3L KIF is outsimming this by a couple points. Better leave and big setup.

#note I should maybe just cash SAVIN this turn. But really, the suspense is a lot of fun.

#note Now that I finally take it, it's a point sacrifice over ENVIES and KNIVES. I dunno, I was a little nervous that he was going to hit it next turn.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCDIOTV 8J OTIC +10 445
#note Nope. I knew I could outrun a JARs or JUTs play, but would lose to a bingo + eating the J. So I just wanted to block the bingo lane, but ideally block the big JUTS spot to save on spread, too. I thought OTIC did it, but I missed INSURANT. That play beats me. I should just let him have the J play and play DIVOT (which gives no bingos). Or I can just ignore that part of the board completely and play AGAVE or CRAZED and just outrun everything. OTIC is a pre-endgame blunder costing me about 5% of a win. But it's actually more than that since he probably didn't keep J or double N when he did TELL. So JN in the bag is somewhat likely. Yet another pre-endgame with win% left on the table.
