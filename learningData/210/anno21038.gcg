#note Yeah. That's not how you spell HAVEREL.  I'm rusty.  9C VOLAE# was the best real play.

#note exch DGHNNV -11.  This play really hurt my game.  I should have thrown out this clunker rack and gone for a two way Z play at 10F.

>Jeremy: ACGILNT O12 GNAT +39 294
#note O12 GNAT is hard to play because I give up my A.  There's that juicy (DOUR)A hook at 15C.  I considered fishing off the L and going for an R to make a triple-tirple CLARTING, but there were no more R's.  I was aware of CLATTING# but didn't know CLAUTING#.  So I need to hit a 4/30 (13.3%) fish and hope Sue doesn't block.  GNAT seems okay.  Duck likes GAIT better though.  Gives me a second spot where I can bingo 15H ending in -ST.
>sue: AWX F4 WAX +59 377
>Jeremy: CIILNST D3 TIC +18 312
#note keeping IS for an -IES(T) bingo at 15H.  BEADIEST or WEEDIEST could happen.  Also threatening ETIC as a decoy which Sue might block.  Or if I draw an E myself, I might get to use this spot later.
>sue: BCDGIIO C2 DIG +17 394
>Jeremy: BEILNSU K3 NUB +20 332
#note giving myself an S hook.  BEILNSTU has a bingo, but it doesn't play.  
>sue: OY J2 YO +15 409
>Jeremy: EEEILOS 2B O.E +14 346
#note Stupid 3 vowel draw.  Trying desperately to make a way to win.  Duck likes 2A EI(D)E best.
>sue: BEITUY A1 UBIETY +43 452
#note I would really have preferred it if Sue transposed the E and I here, to give me just one more chance at fishing, but no dice.
>Jeremy: AEEILSS 15H SEALIES. +88 434
>Jeremy: AEEILSS --  -88 346
#note SEALY is a word.  I think bargaining for a tie with SEALIEST*, which might actually be good in Collins, is a pretty solid play.  88 points + (2 x CIOW) = 88+18 = 106 points.  We'd be tied at 452.  If Sue challenges, and SEALIEST is phony, she cruises into an easy win.  If she challenges, and she's wrong, she loses.  This takes guts to challenge.
>sue: CIOW I1 COW +27 479
#note and Sue makes the right move.  She challenges off that garbage.  sidenote#: G3 COW making (CHA)W(K)# is cool.
>Jeremy: AEEILSS M1 SALES +18 364
#note Too low on time and exasperated to think. I just make a play to prevent going overtime.
