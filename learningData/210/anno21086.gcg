>Tasha: DFGIRUX 8G FIX +26 26
#note HEY YALL I GOT MY VERY FIRST WEAVE!!!!  It makes my head feel kind of heavy.  Anyways, I've been playing Collins with Scott for about a year now and I haven't improved one bit!!

>Tasha: DEELRSU 4H DUE.LERS +74 122
#note After the game, Scott asked me why I didn't play the bingo at L6 and I told him I didn't even notice the spot.  I just automatically started looking for 8s.  Anyways, I'm wearing a "39 piece" weave.  I bought it at this wig store, but I had no idea what I was doing (first time wearing weave) so this dude picked one out for me! :D  
>Scott_Garner: EMPR O4 .PERM +27 68
>Tasha: EHORSTT N6 HO +28 150
#note Yeah, I saw HOTTERS, but I know it's phony in the dictionary I'm used to.  Good in Collins, though.  I just downright missed RHEOSTAT.  It took my hair dresser 3 1/2 hours to sew in the hair.  She said it normally takes 2 1/2, but since the tracks in the hair are sooooooooo tiny, it took a bit longer.  I just found out what a track was three weeks ago.
>Scott_Garner: AJNN M7 JANN +38 106
>Tasha: AEIRSTT 11H ARTIEST +76 226
#note Scott challenged JANNS so +5 for me!  I didn't know JANNS was good.  Actually, I didn't even know JANN.  But I have so many bingos in this rack, I didn't feel like I was risking much.  My weave is 100% human hair! I asked for synthetic hair since that's easiest to take care of, but human hair lasts longer.  Or so I was told.
>Scott_Garner: AENORRV 3C OVERRAN +80 186
>Tasha: DEEIIOT D2 I.IED +18 244
#note When I have racks like this, I start thinking to myself, "Gee, maybe I should start actually STUDYING Collins!"  VOIDEE is so much better.   IVIED also takes a D.  
>Scott_Garner: BHIOSY 12C BOYISH +45 231
>Tasha: EEGKOTW 11D WOK +41 285
#note 11B GOWK for 51.  I do know the Collins twos, but I always forget I'm playing Collins after the first few turns.  It's my joke that in our games, Scott plays Collins while I just do my own thing with TWL.  
>Scott_Garner: ANOR 13F ROAN +22 253
>Tasha: EEEGTUW 13B EEW +29 314
>Tasha: EEEGTUW --  -29 285
#note EEW aint good YET!!!  The other play I considered was 6B WEDGE.  Maybe I should have just played that.  My weave is very short.  Way shorter than my natural hair.  
>Scott_Garner: AD E5 DA +15 268
>Tasha: EEEGTUW 13B WET +26 311
#note I think Scott was surprised when I played this.  It did take me a while because I wanted to play WEE, but both blanks are out and I know better by now.  I always always always get burned by Scott when I do stuff like that.  
>Scott_Garner: AZ L8 ZA +44 312
>Tasha: AEEGOUV 2J V.GUE +34 345
#note Most girls that wear weave do so to make their hair look longer.  But I choose a short one because I didn't want to mess with any hair at all.  My real hair is braided underneath this cap and my hairdresser SEWED the weave onto the cap! It looks so real.  I think most people are just going to think I cut my hair!  :D
>Scott_Garner: DLT M1 L.T.D +12 324
>Tasha: ACEIOPY 9H OY +31 376
#note I went back and forth between OY and ATOPY and decided against ATOPY because of big plays on column O.
>Scott_Garner: CT G6 C..T +17 341
>Tasha: ACEIMNP L11 .MIC +16 392
#note Scored as 18.  Okay, both blanks are still out.  It's time to block!  After the game, Scott said he was surprised at this play.  He was wondering what I had since it was so defensive.  Over the board, I thought that column B was still available for bingoes (make the blank an O for ODA), but there's not even enough room for a seven.  My hairdresser said my weave is gonna look like Halle Berry's hair in Swordfish.  
>Scott_Garner: ?GILNSU 5C G.. +5 346
#note Actual rack.  Yay for defense!  Also, I never saw Swordfish, but she had me at Halle Berry.
>Tasha: ?AEENPU 10M .U +8 400
#note Scott drew the Q after GED.  :) 
>Scott_Garner: ?ILNQSU F11 ...N +10 356
#note Actual rack.  According to Quackle, Scott is supposed to fish off an L.  Sure, he'll draw into bingos if he draws one of the three Es in the bag, but those bingos are unplayable.  So...what's the point in fishing off the L?
>Tasha: ?AEEFNP 15F sAFE +26 426
#note I took a few mintues to figure this out.  I was pretty sure SAFE HAD to be the best endgame play, but the  best play is actually PENs leaving AEF.  For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why until I remembered: This....is....a....COLLINS game.  After I remembered that, I noticed ALEF up top immediately.  But PENS ---> ALEF is still the same 56 point spread difference.  
>Scott_Garner: ?EILQSU H1 QU..S +45 401
#note After the game, I told Scott I was glad he drew the Q when he did.  I was worried about QUADS, and I think it would have been troublesome for me had he been able to play that two turns ago.
>Tasha: ENP 14A PEN +25 451
>Tasha:  (?EIL) +6 457
#note Scott went two minutes over.  Final scores recorded as 464 to 371.
