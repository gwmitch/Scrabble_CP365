#note Pretty clear error not playing this at 7H. Blocking some of my own eights lines for no reason. Random lapse

#note Wow I completely missed 12A ZLOTE. It's not a huge error, but it's clearly the play.

#note WEST was such a bizarre play. Burning his last E and S and blocking the last bingo lane. I was certain it meant the blank was still in the bag and that he was planning to catch up with the X and/or Q. So I decided I could afford to open up the bingo lane on the bottom, and that it was more important to block the 40-pt X setup he just made. But... i have the last 2 E's and there are no O's left. So he can't underlap without burning the blank. That's a silly oversight by me. GUNGE is simming best for scoring well without keeping both U's. I think I need to keep at least one in case I pick the Q. I was admittedly not 100% on GUNGE+. Knew GUNGY and GUNGIER for sure.
