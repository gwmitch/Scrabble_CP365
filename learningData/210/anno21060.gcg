#note I thought long and hard about what LINT implied. I decided it meant he probably had the S, but not the blank. Or it could just mean he has a garbage rack of consonants. Either way, I decided it was going to be possible to pull the blank from the bag. If not for this inference, I was definitely going to go all-in on the MAZELTOV fish. Decent shot at a huge bingo that outruns even his own bingo to SCAT. And he's unlikely to block. But LINT really made me think I should go for turnover for the blank, while also scoring pionts to potentially outrun the scenario in which he has complete drek.

#note Not quite. I had the right idea to score and turn over as many tiles as possible to threaten outs, but there's a better way. 7J HOYLE keeps the EN to threaten ENDIVE, which makes things really tricky for John. HOYLE wins 2.5 times out of 8, while YEN wins 2 out of 8. That said, both plays could win some of those losses because some draws require a perfect endgame from John in a tricky position. He will need to make the perfect block while also setting up multiple outs. Not necessarily easy with a couple minutes to solve it. HOYLE is really tough to see, but I wish I hadn't missed it... because I'm kind of fucking up every single pre-endgame if you havent noticed
