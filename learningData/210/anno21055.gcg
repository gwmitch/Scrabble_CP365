#note Seems weird, but I decided to leave open the scoring spots in the top right and open some more in the left. Planning to draw some scoring tiles and outrun any bingo threats

#note So my tracking was a bit off here and I was under the imrpession that there were only 1 and 2 point tiles left. So I calculated that his bingos through the B would come up one 1 pt short at least. But I missed the P. The P means I am the one coming up short if he has DIRTBAGS or PARABLES or something. I need to leave 1 tile in the bag to beat the bingos through the B, and so UMBER is the play here. My win% drops from 99% to 96% with this error.
