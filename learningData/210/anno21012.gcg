#note As soon as he held this I knew I messed up. FUMARIC and NUMERIC combined? Anyway, a phony bingo at this stage isn't the worst thing to do.

#note Not about to try an S on FUMERIC*
>Doug_Lundquist: ?HINORU J1 UNHeROI. +66 237
>Thomas_Reinke: EINSTYY 2F TYIY. +13 300
#note I wanted to block the trip-trip lane a little bit and shed the Y's. This play does both things. Mission accomplished!
>Doug_Lundquist: ABT 1H AB.T +31 268
>Thomas_Reinke: BEEFKNS 5H KE.F +22 322
#note C9 FIBRE wins the sim. I guess I could use another spot for my S.
>Doug_Lundquist: DEINRTU 3B UNTRIED +80 348
#note I was half-expecting a bingo, but not a blankless one.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?ABENST 14E BANTiES +71 393
#note Did not see the other playable bingo, N3 NESTABLE. This is slightly better, but they both open up easy scores.
>Doug_Lundquist: EEPW 15F WEEP +46 394
>Thomas_Reinke: AELNNOO 3J .ALON +16 409
#note One of 7 winning plays. I wasnted to block stuff hooking KERF while maintaining enough cushion to win if he plays LUNATES+. I did not see his next play, so it's lucky that this wins anyway. I also saw B10 VEINAL, but didn't want to lose in case it somehow wasn't good.
>Doug_Lundquist: AELSTU 1H ....TALS +33 427
#note I had a brief moment of panic after this came down. It seemed like way too many points.
>Thomas_Reinke: ENO A12 .ONE +15 424
#note Sorry about FUMERIC, Doug. Don't judge me too harshly.
>Thomas_Reinke:  (EU) +4 428
