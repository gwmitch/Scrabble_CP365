>Joey_Krafchick: DEEHILN C10 DIEL +24 157
#note Quackle doesn't like this, but I have reasons. In hindsight, I don't myself at all by playing HELD C11, and I think I should have done that for the 6 points. 

DENI(A)L I considered, but I figured why take that spot this turn, when he will burn me badly where I played if I don't play there?

DIEL sims worse than HEEL C10 and HELD C11, but I wanted to keep the H because I'm biased towards H's. Also, on a board I'm trying to control, I'm not in dire need of keeping DIN vs HEN. HEN scores well next turn and I just want points, not a slightly better chance at bingoing while sitting on my cushion. (-7.5)

#note I haven't looked at high prob words in months, but I may have held had I not had a baby bingo coming back. Not challenging TEENIES doesn't lose me the game, but it does lose me spread, which is critical and I need to challenge that in the future!

>Joey_Krafchick: GILOTTZ J2 ZO.. +35 354
#note I saw GI(G)LOT, and chose ZO(OM) instead. ZO(OM) sims ahead by about 5 points. TIZ 3L is another worthy option.
>Wallace_Schultz: J 7F J.. +13 309
>Joey_Krafchick: BGILMTT 2F GLIT. +19 373
#note I have to block 8 letter possibilities from the P at 1A, first. That would be 80+ points, something I can't afford. 

After this, the only place he can bingo really is with the A at 12L on a tight fit or a bingo starting with a vowel at 14F. Both of those would be 60-65 points, which I can afford, on the contrary. 

Lastly, the key to my play is that he literally can't even hit me hard at H1 because I have the B and M, the only tiles in unseen pool from his perspective that score well there. 

I could have played BLITZ for 3 more, but BM > GM feels worth it in this situation.
