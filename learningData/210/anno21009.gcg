#note 8G PST wins the sim. Pretty good leave after that, I guess.

>Thomas_Reinke: EERSSTY K11 YE +20 32
#note K9 YES is 6 more points, but then he'll know I have an S! Which would be pretty much the end of the world.

#note I chose the most pedestrian bingo in order to trick Bruce into thinking that I was not a very good Scrabble player so that he would let his guard down.

#note Quackle wants me to exchange UU. D8 AKEBIA+ is cool, but not any better than this.

#note Seemed obvious, but Quackle wants me to leave the S off. It's times like these that I ask myself "Why do I take Scrabble advice from a magical electricity box?".
