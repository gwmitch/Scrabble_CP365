>Deen_Hergott: EHOSTV 8F HOVE +20 20
#note I spotted HOVE when he was drawing. Not my fault! :P

Sorta got scared I might lose this one, but I drew my own S and was content.
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEEOPS 9E BOP +22 22
#note The other BOP is probably better but with his ST leave I wanted to set up points for myself if he bingos, but he's probably bingo-ing underlapping BOP most of the time anyway, so silly lapse.
>Deen_Hergott: EJTU 10B JUTE +31 51
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIRS 11E SEEDIER +92 114
#note sick, his leave after HOVE was probably better than mine after BOP, unless it was JST
>Deen_Hergott: AEISU H10 A.IEU +7 58
#note yeah, this is a tiltish play but is makes a lot of sense. I like it.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIMTUW 10J WAIT +30 144
>Deen_Hergott: ANOSX 15G AXON +75 133
#note right back in the game with a good draw
>Joshua_Sokol: AMOSSTU B10 .OUST +24 168
#note setting up my M
>Deen_Hergott: ?ADEGIS M6 SEDA.InG +72 205
#note 13A a(S)SEGAI(E)D is probably the coolest disconnected nine I have ever seen. Other options score a bit better.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIKMRSU 12A K.RU +26 194
#note Oh no. This is what I get for being vegetarian: a rare lapse of a meat word. I also didn't think MAIR was a word?
>Deen_Hergott: AFR 7E ARF +28 233
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIMOS J2 AnOMIES +73 267
#note First laid down ATOMISE at L2, and upon realizing I was making SE I just quickly played this, doubting HOVES* nonetheless. He held for a long time, then chickened out of LICHTED and released. Huge mistake on Deen's part but also huge mistake on my part for doubting AIrSOME only because it seemed too familiar to be a word, as I know I haven't studied high prob 7s in forever. Of course, it's a new high prob 7, so there's that... I could also see AMOSiTE or just play AtOMISE on the other side, which I didn't like. Or I could make the awesomest* play in the word with 15F t(AXON)OMIES for 63. Anything but this.
>Deen_Hergott: CDEHILT N2 DITCH +51 284
#note He only saw LICHTED at L1 though, and that would have been correct to play over the one at N3, cause...
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGILOR 3E ELOIG.ER +61 328
#note cause I am a luckbox

>Joshua_Sokol: GINNRVY A4 .RYING +36 402
#note I wanted to keep my consonant here, and I should have. Just play C3 N(E)RVY. That E is actually probably the most dangerous line on the board right now.
>Deen_Hergott: MNO O1 MON +20 340
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEFNVW C3 F.W +18 420
#note I didn't know what to do, so I decided to make sure nothing crazy happened. I might have been missing a bingo. There is nothing, but whatever. I'm supposed to play C1 WAV(E). That's a nice play. I knew he didn't have the Y last turn so I imagined I was going to draw it some of the time. That makes WAVE even better.
>Deen_Hergott: CILNNRT 14G T.NIC +17 357
#note 13G R(E)NTIN(G) or TINN(E)R but Deen was just tired of this bs.
