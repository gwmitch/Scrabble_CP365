#note L1 SkIDOOE(D)! Scored as 68 (73). I didn't recognize EIDOLON necessarily taking an S, and it was 5-point, so yeah.

#note had a feeling he had the Z! Good thing I played HAUL
>Joshua_Sokol: NNOPRSU J5 OP +25 103
#note Oh boy, what a bad miss of UNP(E)RSON! I didn't know the word. I took a long time here and just made a bad play.
>Andrew_Golding: GIOY 10D YOGI +24 163

#note First occurence of HAULD# being a thing.
>Andrew_Golding: FGO M1 FOG +23 186
>Joshua_Sokol: BFIRRRS 12H FIB +30 149
#note I just don't want to get rid of my S do I? For the past few turns I was really at a loss. Hoping for a miracle draw next turn... 12A FRIBS# looks right over this.
>Andrew_Golding: JSU 2J JU..S +58 244
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRRRST -RR +0 149
#note That was a nice draw, I guess. F10 (GI)RR# is 5 more than this, and I should probably play H10 S(OF)TER anyway.
>Andrew_Golding: AW 1M .AW +29 273
>Joshua_Sokol: ADENRST H11 ..TEN +24 173
#note Now I remember ENDARTS#! I had a feeling STANDER had a Collins anagram, but I couldn't put my finger on it. And again, knowing HAULD# would have helped. I should have at least thought of it, since it makes sense as an old English-type word. HAULT# is also good! Also STARNED#. After making the play I realized I probably should have tacked on the S for 12 more. I also missed 9H DA#. I'm not posting this game because I played particularly well. I don't expect to play well in Collins!

>Joshua_Sokol: EHILOSV 15H .OVELISH +95 341
>Joshua_Sokol: ACENRTX (challenge) +5 346
#note Here I am sitting on (N)OVELISH#, trying to see if any other gambit makes sense. I was pretty certain NOVELISH was not a word in the North American dictionary, so I hated that it seemed my only way back into the game. But sometimes, risks pay off, and this is indeed a Collins-only word. I knew there were lots of ISH# words, but this was still a total shot in the dark.
>Andrew_Golding: BEOY 13J OBEY +27 352
#note YEBO# plays at 14K for 33
>Joshua_Sokol: ACENRTX 13B EXTRAC. +38 384
#note I couldn't risk URE#. I was only around 60% on its validity. But damn, it's good. All of my better plays play on row 5. But this play still has a lot of merit!
>Andrew_Golding: AEP 12B PEA +27 379
>Joshua_Sokol: AACIKNR B12 ..CK +24 408
#note This was a bad play, but I had a good thought process behind it. I immediately saw 14A KA (which is Quackle's choice here, by the way). It looked like a great play, but I wondered if it won me the game if I drew the Q. It didn't seem like it did. The only thing I am afraid of in this endgame is drawing the Q. If I play B10 CA(PE)R, I empty the bag, and allow Andrew full knowledge of my rack for the endgame, which really messes me up in endgames where I draw the Q. Now, it seems like if I draw the Q, Andrew is very likely to win, since the rest of the pool is decent for bingos. But maybe I can win sometimes. Anyways, this play was trying to avoid losing when Andrew does not bingo, but I failed to assess the fact that he could have E(K)ING for 33. So this was just silly in that respect. If I'm going to be aggressive, I should play KA. Anyways, I decided to play 2 tiles off to reduce my chances of drawing the Q, increase his (stick him with it if it's the last tile in the pool and he bingos), and just make everything much more difficult to ascertain on his end.
>Andrew_Golding: EEEGINT E2 E.. +3 382
#note Actual rack. Andrew has to hope the blank is in the bag, that's unless he plays 5B TINGE, which wins when he draws an A as well. All of the one-tile E fishes he can make win if he draws the blank. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINNQR 2B QI +24 432
#note I'm screwed if he has a bingo, but I have to hope he doesn't!
>Andrew_Golding: ?EEGINT 15A E.ING +33 415
#note And it worked! He drew the blank! So obviously Andrew did not know HAULT#. But GENTIlE is his only semi-obvious bingo that plays at 6A. The other two, vENTIGE# and kITENGE#, are very obscure. Anyways, with a lot of pressure and a lot of tiles the blank can be, I probably would have missed GENTIlE too... This is his best non-bingo play, but it comes just short.
>Joshua_Sokol: AANNR F1 AN..AR +14 446
>Andrew_Golding: ?ET 1E b.TE +12 427
#note 11A EsT is 24, bringing the final score to 441-446. What a nailbiter!
