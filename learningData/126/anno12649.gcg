#note Interesting that the sim gives a very slight edged to KAYOED. I suppose it isn't surprising, given that I am opening up two hot spots here.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?EILNST J4 LuNIEST +83 146
#note Held this. Wasn't positive that UNCLOSE wasn't an adjective.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AGQSTY 5I Q.AY +30 189
#note Sim prefers QUAG by a couple points. I keep forgetting just how crappy G is. Plus he is going to score a little better with my slotting a Y in line with those DLS-DWS spots.

#note Not the time to open big scoring lines with the plays on row 14. I think it's between this and FROW, which are both nicely defensive. FROW has a lot of aggressive upside though, so that is what I should have done.
>John_O'Laughlin: AAIINOT -AIO +0 187
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEFRRSW 14F FEW +33 337
#note I figured these points put the game out of reach. But the sim wants me to keep safe with 5D DREW. No matter. Everything is 99.5% or more to win.

#note Nice. Gives him a shot.

#note Saw MOZETTA but wasn't 1000% sure of it. I can afford to take the chance, but this is a spreadless tournament, so it's not like running up the score will help me.
