>John: EFIRX 8D FIXER +38 38
>Reid: AEGILOT 7D OLEA +24 24
#note OLEA is #2 (36.56). GOX at F6 has a wonderful leave which explains its ranking despite scoring less. I had also considered FOLIAGE (#6, 34.99). TAO at 7E is tied for #2.
>John: TV F6 V..T +22 60
>Reid: DEEGIRT E7 ..EDER +16 40
#note TET (36.17%) at 9D is #1 and RIG (35.96%) at H8 is #2. Interestingly, 3 of the top 15 plays are exchanges. This explains why this was such a tough board. I hated parting with both of my E. Quackle agrees that I should really not have done so, but I panicked because of the slow start. My play is #13 according to valuations from Quackle speedy player.
>John: BEW D11 WEB +25 85
>Reid: ABGILTT F11 BATT +19 59
#note BATT is #6 (27.63%). Playing the extra T is not worth the 3 points and the risk. BAT (29.65%), TAB (28.89%), BAIL (27.76%) are #1-3 respectively. TAG and BAG are #4 and 5.  I had the right idea but was too greedy for points at this point.
>John: EJNO 15E JEON +40 125
#note I had specifically played BATT because it only had Y and S hooks. I reminded myself that BATTE was invalid before playing. When the great Leubkemann played BATTE I was stunned and began to wonder about the invalidity of BATTE. Not challenging here was probably the biggest mistake of the game. An extra turn could have evened the game and possibly snagged the first blank.
>Reid: GIILOUW 14F .WIG +15 74
#note I didn't like this rack and neither does Quackle. TWIG is #11 (14.11%). All the other top 15 plays are exchanges. Exchanging all tiles is #1. Not exchanging here is a big mistake.
>John: ?AAAIPR 13I APRAxIA +72 197
>Reid: EGILORU N10 LOU.E +14 88
#note EULOGIA at O7 (4.13%) and L7(2.9%) are #1 and #4 respectively. RUGOLA at O8 is #2 (3.19%). GLORIA (2.95%) at O8 is #3. I attempted to block and balance with my play but failed horrible. Missing the #1 play here is just another huge mistake. Perhaps I can take some solace in the fact that Quackle believes my chances for winning are slim. LOUIE is #10 based on valuations from speedy player.
>John: ?CEIMOT O8 COInM.TE +188 385
>Reid: DILNORR L12 L.RD +14 102
#note LARD is #4. RAND, DRIB at 13A, DORR at K10 are 1-3 respectively.
>John: HIU 8L HUI. +13 398
>Reid: DEINOPR 9L OP +19 121
#note OP is #5 according to listing order by Quackle 5-min player. PROOF at D4, PRION at 7I, and DAG at I12 and POOF at D5 are 1-4 respectively. PROOF certainly opens things up. PRION is poorly positioned because it blocks the FIXERS hook. DAG is fishing and is ill-considered at this point. POOF similarly only accomplishes balancing. I consider the game to be, so taking points seems okay to me. i think my play is the best one here.
>John: AAA -AAA +0 398
#note Obviously I only know the number of tiles exchanged here.
>Reid: DEEINRS I2 DENIERS +76 197
#note DENIERS scores 1 pt less than NEREIDS. I saw them both but didn't bother calculating the score difference.
>John: GIN H1 GIN +17 415
>Reid: ADEOOTY 7I .OOTY +30 227
#note ROOTY and TOADY are tied for first based on win % of 0.01. I believe my play is superior.
>John: IO G3 OI +7 422
>Reid: ACDEFSZ K9 FEZ +38 265
#note FEZ is listed as #12 according to 5-min quackle player (but first in valuation and #1 according to speedy player) . FAD is #2. FEZ at F1 is #1. I'd agree that sacrificing 8 points is worth it if I knew that I could be blocking my opponents ING play, but it's still possible I could get that spot. Closing up the board is not a good strategy in my mind. I think my play is the best play here.
>John: KN 5I .NK +14 436
>Reid: ACDLQSU L1 QUADS +58 323
#note QUADS is #2 according to Quackle 5-minute championship player. I realize that QADI at #1 keeps the S and does not afford the easy Q triple, but 30 extra points for an S when there are 2 more unaccounted for is just fine by me. I think my play is the obvious choice; it's always possible that my opponent wont be able to use the Q and I will. This would just serve to reduce losing spread if I can't use the 1 lane to bingo.
>John: AGINRSU 1A SUGARIN. +83 519
#note Just adds insult to injury.
>Reid: CELMNSV 3K V.C +16 339
#note VAC is #3. VACS is #2 and MAVEN is #1. I failed to properly track this round, and I was despondent after the last bingo, so I didn't really care much for stressing this endgame.
>John: AAHTY C1 .HAT +16 535
>Reid: ELMNS 14A MELS +21 360
#note #1 play. ELMS is the same.
>John: AY D3 YA +19 554
>John:  (N) +2 556
#note This game was recorded as 359. 9 of my 13 plays are in the top 5. I didn't miss any bingos. However, missing EULOGIA, failing to challenge BATTE, and not exchanging on turn 4 were all big mistakes. Overall I give myself a C+ this game.
