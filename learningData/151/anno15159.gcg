#note Don't mind passing bingos up here - Quackle has M8 NOSTRIL/ROSINOL a very slight amount better.
>Carl: IQS J6 QIS +42 150
>Will: ?AELRST M7 cRESTAL +75 230
#note VESTRAL was the best play down column M. I missed TERRELLAS and didn't know SERRULATE.
>Carl: ILWY F3 WILY +37 187
>Will: AADIMRZ L12 ZA +46 276
#note ZAMIA is the best play here - no need to open a nice line for -S and -ING when I could have scored 6 more to open almost nothing.
>Carl: AEUV B9 UVE. +15 202
>Will: AEIMNOR H10 .EMORA +33 309
#note This and REMAIN sim quite well. The ensuing turns made me regret this play but it was probably fine. It at least addresses the ZA lane pretty well, though I shouldn't have created it to begin with.
>Carl: GOP 8L P.OG +30 232
>Will: EIINTUU 6H TU.UE +14 323
#note This, K3 ETUI, K4 UNIT, or something else? Sim prefers K3 ETUI - all of the options here yield pretty similar scores to Carl, but ETUI ends up scoring slightly better next turn, presumably due to the starting leave of 1C/2V with no doubles.
>Carl: ADEEFN A4 DEAFEN +38 270
>Will: DIINNRT C11 N.TID +14 337
#note C2 DINT is okay, also prevents any nasty OFAY plays. NITID and NIDI sim closely behind, which is weird because the dearth of remaining vowels seems like it would sway things in NITID's direction.
>Carl: CEHT C2 ECHT +26 296
#note Clever Carl had the W
>Will: IIINNPR O4 PIIN. +11 348
#note Wow, the options here were all amazingly unappealing. This was one of the most confusing turns of my Nationals. It seemed like every candidate play created new X plays, but it wasn't clear to me whether that was something to avoid in this situation - with all the X plays already available, blocking the X completely was going to be pretty tough. I considered 14J RIP, but balked at making such a huge scoring spot for the S. If I play RIP and Carl has SW, I will get hit with WECHT and ZAPS and really struggle to keep pace leaving IINN. I considered RAPINI and PANINI too, and those do a nice job at reaching for SX. RAPINI in particular leaves IN to play an -ING word down O in case I draw a balanced combination, but I ultimately decided bingoing should not be my goal here. RIPING is better than PIING if I decide to play down column O - not sure why I chose the latter. I might have preferred not to create a GRIPING hook with two Gs available but that is an extremely low priority in this position. I actually initially wrote that I liked RIPING best, but as I look again, I think RAPINI must be best - it blocks ZAX, and the new X spot created is quite weak, only allowing the unlikely XU (and I have the case I if I draw the X myself). If Carl doesn't play his X in that area immediately I will often be able to score decently and close both spots with a play like ROB or ROM 14J, and hopefully outrun WECHT plays in the process.

>Will: BDIMNRR 4L DRI. +14 362
#note Reversing course and trying to limit the damage from the X, but leaving 4 consonants here is so crippling, and he scores 40 with it most times anyway. A serious mistake. I burned a lot of time on the previous position, so I don't have much more to spare. Quackle prefers me to play 2B MEND, scoring as much as I can and leaving a vowel.
>Carl: EGGKOUX 14J GOX +34 367
#note Carl burns most of *his* time on this very confusing position. The only play that 'wins' is N6 KI, but playing out each sequence suggests that Carl is dead to accurate play here.
>Will: BHMNORY 2B H.RB +28 390
#note Missed the runaway best play of M1 MYRRH but HERM/HERB are the second best sequences.
>Carl: EGKSU 15E SKU. +8 375
#note Time pressure sets in
