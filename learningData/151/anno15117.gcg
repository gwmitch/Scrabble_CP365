>Lawren: BDLNOTX -BDLNOT +0 0
>Reid: EEEJNRU H8 JEU +20 20
#note #3 (53.83%) play according to Quackle 5-min championship player. JEU at 8G and 8F are #1 (54.63%) and #2 (53.95%). I was attempting to hide the U from an easy X or Q play. In hindsight, several other consonants could have a similar impact, so the play position is indeed poor. Not a big mistake however.
>Lawren: GIIOPRX -GII +0 0
>Reid: AEEFNRS 10F FE. +14 34
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-min championship player.
>Lawren: LOT I7 LOT +17 17
>Reid: AEGNRRS J8 GARNERS +76 110
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-min championship player.
>Lawren: U 11J .U +4 21
#note At this point I was beginning to question my opponent's commitment to winning.
>Reid: ACENNOV 11C COVEN +27 137
#note #2 (89.17%) according to Quackle 5-min championship player. VEENA 12H (89.18%) is #1. I prefer my play for its positioning.
>Lawren: ADEHIST 13H HA.DIEST +76 97
>Reid: AADINOP O12 A.OP +21 158
#note ATOP is #6 according to Quackle speedy player. DIAPASON at N8 is the #1 play. PHON was considered but I wanted to play off an A.
>Lawren: OPT H12 P.OT +36 133
>Reid: ADFINNY D11 .FAY +20 178
#note According to 5-min championship player, FANION D7 is #1 (64.78%). I had considered FOY (#7, 63.30%) at D10, and FIND (#5, 64.10%) but I really wanted to get the FY from my rack. OFAY is #6 according to valuations from speedy player.
>Lawren: IORST 15A ROIST +30 163
>Lawren: IORST --  -30 133
>Reid: DEINNRX 14A NIX. +28 206
#note The reckless NIXY is #4 (76.19%) according Quackle 5-min championship player. I wanted to avoid wasting the X and to get an N from my rack. NIX(#3, 76.85%) at L12 accomplishes this as well, but scores fewer for the conservative play.  NIXY makes it hard for Lawren to come back with ess hook on OFAY, but it opens up the potential for a triple triple. XENIC (77.29%) is #2 but also gives triple with double letter and leaves no vowels. FEDEX is #1 (77.38%) at F10 and scores enough to justify carry the NN forward. DEXY is #14 and scores well but carries the same risk as NIXY without resolving the NN problem. Suprisingly, my play is not too bad.
>Lawren: IST 15B TIS +27 160
#note While I obviously don't know the whole story, at the time, this seemed like a waste of an S. However, it scored okay and blocked the triple word. She did not have a blank or extra S at this time. TI accomplishes the same purpose. So essentially she played the S for 14 more points.
>Reid: ADEENRS K2 ENDEARS +78 284
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-min championship player.
>Lawren: OOR 15F RO.O +4 164
>Reid: ALLMMUU J1 AMU +23 307
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-min chamiponship player.
>Lawren: Z 6J Z. +31 195
>Reid: BIILLMU 1F MILI. +21 328
#note MILIA(98.22%) is #4 according to Quackle 5-min championship player. Astonishingly, I had considered #2 BULIMIC at C5 (98.68%), but missed BULIMIA (#1, 99.62) at 1D. LIMBA is #3 (98.23%). Missing the powerful BULIMIA is a big mistake here.
>Lawren: ADEINRV 2A RAVINED +85 280
#note Even if I had played BULIMIA, REINVADE was still available here.
>Reid: BCEGLOU A1 G.UB +30 358
#note GRUB(88.62%) is #2 according to Quackle 5-min championship player. BROGUE is #1 (89.91%) but I dont like the leave of CL even if I had considered it. I like my play here. However, BROGUE, does pull more tiles so not playing a longer word reduced my chances for pulling a blank.
>Lawren: HKT L12 K.TH +30 310
#note While KITH at D1 scores more, it clogs up more bingo lanes than L12. This is a good play if that was intentional.
>Reid: ACEEILO C2 .OICE +20 378
#note I spent more than my usual short amount of time on this play. Both blanks were still unaccounted for, so I wanted to block some bingo lanes, while trying to pull at least one blank and balance at the same time. VOICE is #1 according to 5-minute championship player.
>Lawren: Q D1 Q. +21 331
>Reid: ABEELNR 7C REBEL +21 399
#note REBEL is a poor choice here. I was attempting to block lanes 6, 7 and E. While that was accomplished, I had overlooked the triple in lane A.
>Lawren: AW 6E AW +30 361
>Reid: ADGLNWY 5E WANY +42 441
#note This is the crucial game losing turn. WANLY and WADY at 5E are #1 and 2 respetively. They both win the game. I had plenty of time to calculate the score even if opponent bingoed at A7 but I would not see this spot (amazingly) until she was pondering her final play. I was thinking lane N was the only bingo lane. I figured WANY at #3 scored enough to ensure the win.
>Lawren: ??EIIOT A7 sEdITIO. +71 432
>Lawren:  (DGL) +10 442
#note This game was officially scored as 442-439 because I declined to do a recount. I was still sore from not seeing the A lane.
