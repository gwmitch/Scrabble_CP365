#note MURREY or MURKY? First of all MURREY is better defensively to avoid opening that easy triple. It also seemed like the board would be easier to bingo on after Siri's next play post-MURREY compared to post-MURKY, but Quackle thinks it's the other way around with MURKY leading to many more bingos, presumably because of the addition of the R in the leave, the E in YELKS left open, and the 3 floaters I receive after plays at H1. I still prefer MURREY.

#note Agonized over this. 5K ELAN is the safe option, but I don't know if I saw it.
>Siri: IPSW 15L WISP +45 258
>Will: ACDILOW D1 CODA +30 226
#note F8 LOW sims well, but I think CODA is okay too. Best way to score that doesn't get hammered in response.

#note HALF is doing well in sim, but that probably also assumes that every time opp has an H it is getting played with HALATION, when that might not be the case here.
>Siri: EGO O1 GOE. +15 304
>Will: BEFHRTX I9 F.B +20 326
#note I like this play best for sure. I should have plenty of inside scoring opportunities with HALATION and the I6 X spot and I make opening the board much more annoying for Siri.
