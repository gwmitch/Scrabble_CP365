#note is this completely wrong? NAY at 9B sims best - LENS is a great leave. he might do something small and blocky though, and there is like 1 S spot on the whole board. i didn't like NAY that much. am i wrong? someone teach please. (-1)

#note this is a HORRIBLE move. it gives back a lot and my bingo percentage and next turn scores are garbage. E10 NULL is cleary best and very simple. why do i do this at nationals. i still suck. 10H SLUE is a good move too.
