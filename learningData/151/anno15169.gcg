>Matt_Canik: AEENOTU 8F EAU +6 6
#note Torn between exchanging and playing here. Q likes exchaning 3 by a good margin. 
>Joe_Gaspard: ?AEILPV H6 PL.VIAtE +62 62
#note I held this for several minutes, but with PREVAIL available I just don't see why he'd play this unless he knew it. The worst part is this should be in my range but I didn't even take the time to calculate whether it would be. 
>Matt_Canik: EGNOTYY 6F TY.Y +14 20
#note This is just really bad. TYPEY or GAYETY are far superior. 
>Joe_Gaspard: ABH G11 BAH +26 88
>Matt_Canik: AEGINOX I12 EX +40 60
#note Within seconds of hitting my clock, I see (HE)XAGON. The sim actually prefers EX, probably because I play HEXAGON next turn. 
>Joe_Gaspard: EEN 9F NE.E +14 102

>Joe_Gaspard: LOORT 11C TOOL..R +28 130
>Matt_Canik: EIMOSTW 12A MEOW +36 132
#note WO 14J is a hyperaggressive option that I'd make against higher-rater players. I decided to play MEOW on the left to leave HEXAGONS open for my S.

>Matt_Canik: FILNOST 14D LOFT +24 156
#note Trying to set up the S again with BAHTS.

#note I didn't think this is was a word when I played it. It should be. 
>Joe_Gaspard: AINV 1D .IVAN +27 342
>Matt_Canik: DEIQSUU 5A QUI.S +28 262
#note With the last U, this gives me some glimmer of hope in this game. 
>Joe_Gaspard: FRRRTTT -FRRTTT +0 342
>Matt_Canik: BDEERSU N9 BED. +9 271
#note With Joe's last play, I can't help but assume that he threw back from a rack of 7 consonants and more than likely has a good number of the remaining vowels now. Nonetheless, if I draw a few things like ACT or COT into this rack, I can bingo through the Q while he eats up the O spot. 
>Joe_Gaspard: FORT N1 FORT. +22 364
>Matt_Canik: CERSTTU L12 ..T +10 281
#note Well I got the C and the T like I wanted. Good effort.
