#note Wow, this is an interesting position... I didn't even think to go for a bingo here. If I was playing a 2000+ fishing makes a lot more sense, but is that true against an 1800? Dropping TO/OY gives me a lot of bingoes in multiple spots - I can draw the C, D, and S for an unblockable bingo, and the A, I, and V for bingos through the N which is likely to stay open (this adds up to 9/18). If Ross blocks the N lane instead of the OY hook then I bingo with the F, H, N, or R. The pool isn't bingo friendly for Ross, so even if I don't hit right away, I'm likely to have another chance, although the fish will be much weaker because Ross will know exactly what I'm doing and block accordingly. Perhaps I should make an in-between play like OA(K) or even ZOA? The sim doesn't take into account that Ross will almost definitely block the -OY hook, which decreases my bingo chances by a bit.

#note Missed NA(OI), but this is much MUCH better. I believe I can win 95-100% of the time if Ross has the Q, because if he plays it for cheap than I outrun him in the endgame with THIAZOLES vs. his one-vowel rack, and if he doesn't play the Q then I've just created a block for both Q spots. I ran a bunch of sims and it looks like I can even sometimes outrun plays like FOC(U)S(E)S with perfect endgame play. So assuming a random rack for Ross, RID can win almost 80% of the time against perfect play, and more so against any mistakes.

#note My play still wins, but I can also play some THIAZOLES play right away to avoid Ross blocking the spot. Then after QI I can get NAOI.
