#note I've been having these weird spacial laps where I don't think things hit the DWS when they do. Other side is better.

#note Ben set down a V at 11A first. This tells me that he's probably holding 6 consonants with this play, as any vowel would probably get played with this M if he had one. I don't think it's too much a stretch to infer an S as well, since there are very few VI??? words with all consonants that don't have an S.

#note With the knowledge from the last play, I think he won't have a big counter to this if he drew a consonant. Maybe I should have played POXED C3 instead with that information, because I have an I and he almost certainly doesn't, but I think he'll also play through the O a lot.
