#note i actually wasn't sure of this word, and almost chickened out on it, especially against jesse who would know. quackle is liking the other position of it slightly better -- no. (-0.5)

#note no good. i wanted to play PHIZ and it is better, but totally missed the awesome DEPUTIZE. (-10) in general, i wanted to keep the board a little more open and liked the leave of NUDZH over that of PHIZ, but it might give up too much.

#note laid down ZAG then decided on this; ZAG is more defensive and i score way more next turn than PATZER. i just like keeping up the scoring pressure most of the time, but it didn't work out this game. (-4.5)

#note LENTO has a better enough leave that it makes up for the point loss apparently. i wanted to start going for some turnover at this point but i'm actually down and it seems more beneficial to try to bingo. (-2.5)

#note it's this or D10 YAULD which sims a little better. i'm not so excited about an LN leave but a U has to be worse. i think i was overvaluing tile turnover now. (-1.5)
