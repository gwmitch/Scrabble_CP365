>Avery: ACDEIMO 8D MEDIC +26 26
#note An underrated/dangerous opponent to start things off. Avery provided his racks, though I think I miswrote some. Maybe MODICA for Mojica?
>Will: AJKLOSY I7 JOKY +42 42
#note E5 JOKEY worth consideration to keep the MEDICS hook alive but the points/defense combo of JOKY is too good.
>Avery: ABGOOOU 7C GOBO +20 46
>Will: ?AFLPRS 10C PALFRe.S +75 117
>Avery: ADELOSU D10 .LOUD +12 58
>Will: FGQTVXY -FGQTVY +0 117
#note XY is synergetic but every extra tile pick is a chance at an I for XI C13.
>Avery: II -II +0 58
>Will: IISUVWX C13 XI +39 156
>Avery: AEGIIST 6F GIT +17 75
>Will: EIRSUVW C5 VU. +7 163
#note Whiffing the star play of H1 SWIVET. Among the other options, VUG seems okay.
>Avery: AOZ J5 AZO +41 116
>Will: EILRSTW 5I T.W +12 175
#note I considered JOW but I have no idea why I passed it up. Must be worth it despite the risk of heavy hitting 8K responses because I get new through tiles to work with after those plays.

>Avery: DEMRRTU B2 DUR.M +38 241
>Will: ABEHNOS 4D OBEAH +36 308
#note With the case S in hand there's no need to do N2 OBEAHS - that spot has much bigger upside for me.
