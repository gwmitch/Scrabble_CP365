>Reid: GIIRTUV H4 VIRTU +24 24
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-min championship player.
>Mike: DFGII 6G F.IGID +15 15
>Reid: AAGIKLY 5K KAY +35 59
#note #1 play.
>Mike: LORT 4L ROTL +23 38
>Reid: AAGILUY O1 GUL.Y +27 86
#note GULLY is #4 (58.04%). GLUILY at O3 (60.88%) is #1, and LIGULA at O4 (60.09%) is #2. GAILY is #3 (59.64%). I gambled by keeping the AA in exchange for ridding myself of UY and this would turn out to be a huge mistake. GAILY balances and scores best. A single U is not a huge liability, especially with the Q out. 
>Mike: ERSTV 3I VERTS +41 79
>Reid: AAAEINO 2J AA +10 96
#note Quackle 5-min championship player believes exchanging is the best strategy here. AEON at 9G is #4. Exchanging AAAO is #1. AA is #3 according to speedy player. I like my play, but it would turn out to be pretty bad. I had forgotten SAE.
>Mike: CDEINOS 1D INCODES +86 165
>Mike: CDEINOS --  -86 79
#note I had to think on this one a little bit before challenging.
>Reid: AADEINO 1I ANOA +11 107
#note ANOA is #3 (57.13%). I had considered AEON (#2, 57.20%) but wanted to keep my E and avoid giving Mike a double word for his bingo. There were lots of E in the bag, so this was prolly unnecessary. I needed to block the triple because I knew Mike would bingo the next turn irregardless of my play; thus, ODEA #1 (57.52%) was not considered. I think my play is the best one in a bad situation.
>Mike: CDEINOS 9E CODEINS +72 151
>Reid: DEEIIOS 10J OI +10 117
#note Missing DIOECIES here was likely the game losing mistake. All my brain could think of was DIECIOUS. Mike had already drawn the first blank, but the momentum shift may have forced him to change his blocking strategy later in the game. Getting my bingo takes away any bingo from him next turn. OI is #4 according to speedy player.
>Mike: ?AFIOST E7 FA.TIOnS +74 225
>Reid: DEEEISW D12 WEED +33 150
#note #1 play
>Mike: HOPQ 11I QOPH +49 274
>Reid: BDEIJRS 8D J.B +24 174
#note #1 play. I hesitated here because it cuts of 2 bingo lanes, but there is still the QOPH hook and I really want to get the J out of my rack w/o wasting it. I had also considered JIBE at D4 (#2), but i wanted to keep some vowels in my rack. There seem to be an abundance of E in the bag, so this was probably overcautious.
>Mike: EEP 15A PEE. +21 295
>Reid: CDEIRRS 10B CRI. +12 186
#note Oh man, this is getting bad. I remember thinking at the time, "man my rack is really close to DESCRIES". The best play is DESCRIERS at 14C. I didn't even look for a 9. CRIT is #12 according to speedy player valuations. The positioning is poor. CRIT blocks the B lane.
>Mike: AW 14B WA.. +26 321
>Reid: DELNRSX 2N X. +18 204
#note XU is #3 (0.62%). HEX (1.05%) at L11 and EX (0.65%) at 12L are 1,2. I discounted both because I wanted to keep the QOPH hook alive.
>Mike: AEU 7L EAU +10 331
#note EAU is played here presumably to shut off M lane w/o exposing the 13 lane by playing it for more points at 12K or 12L. Nice cautious play afforded my the comfortable lead due to my missed bingos.
>Reid: DELMNRS 8L REND +30 234
#note REND is #6 (0.72%). MELD (1.43%), MEND (1.24%), and MERL (0.93%) at 12L are 1-3. I don't like them because they don't create an easy bingo lane (they do create an a triple triple that also gives a triple word.) EMEND (0.76%) at 13B and EMENDER (0.74) at 13C are 4,5. While EMEND has a better leave than REND, I still think REND is the best positioned of the top 5. I like my play here.
>Mike: GNU O8 .UNG +6 337
#note Baron continues to methodically close the board down now. This is my punishment for missing bingos.
>Reid: BHILMNS M11 SHIM +37 271
#note SHIM is #15. BUNN (5.7%) at N6 is #1. This is Quackle balancing for a bingo that has no home. I suppose in the simulations, my opponent is supposed to open the board for me. MIB (5.27%) and MEL(4.97%) at 12L  are 2.3. While they score well, they do nothing to create bingo lanes. MENSH (#4, 4.87%) at 13C scores well and opens a bingo hook. There are lots of vowels left, so this is an attractive play. Morever, if Mike blocks G14, it may create hooks for a triple bingo. My thinking was to play SHIM for points, create a triple bingo lane and the 13 lane and hopefully pull the last blank. A tall order indeed. I think MENSH is probably the best play here.
>Mike: ?EELNRT 15G RELENTs +80 417
#note The tile gods did not believe I deserved the last blank.
>Reid: ABELMNZ H12 MAZ. +18 289
#note I had kinda tuned out of the end game after the last play. Surprisingly, I had managed to properly track tiles. Quackle is doggedly determined to reduce the spread. HEM and HAM at L11 are #1 and #3 and they efficiently use the M while preserving scoring opportunities for the Z the next turn. I was more concerned with getting the Z out of my rack at this point. BIZ at 13L accomplishes this but allows Mike to also utilized the Z. This is a horrible play. MALEFACTIONS at E3 is interesting  but has a horrible leave. My play is #4 according to speedy player. My play is okay, but shortshighted.
>Mike: EIOOT 12L O.O +22 439
#note Missing HEM and HAM affords Mike the opportunity to efficiently use his weak rack. MAZE looks even worse now.
>Reid: BELN 13L B.NE +16 305
#note #1 play.
>Mike: EIT G9 .ITE +9 448
>Mike:  (L) +2 450
#note 10 of my 14 plays are in the top 5. I missed two bingos that could have been momentum changers. While I initially thought this game was bad luck, it really came down to poor play. My end game was lacking. Overall, I give myself a D+ this game.
