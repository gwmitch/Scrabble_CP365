>Paul_Avrin: DKNU 8F DUNK +18 18
>Nick: CDDEGGR G6 DR.GGED +14 14
#note 2nd behind ... CUD G2, leaving DEGGR and scoring 11. No thanks. Especially since I want a nice open board
>Paul_Avrin: AEU 10F A.UE +7 25
>Nick: BCEFINR 11C FIBR. +22 36
#note Quackle prefers FIB 11I, or FIBRE 11I. the additional three points to gie him an R and E. I don't know.

>Nick: CEMNPTZ 8A ZET. +39 75
#note Ugh, no option.	
>Paul_Avrin: JO B6 JO. +26 117
>Nick: ACMNPUY 6G .UMPY +19 94
#note YUP or YUM at 9I. I didn't see it. I guess the score is just too much nicer. 
>Paul_Avrin: ADV K3 DAV. +22 139
>Nick: ACHLNTX 4J C.LX +26 120
#note Missed LATCH/NATCH 14B. Board vision problem. Didn't even look down there because I was so consonant heavy. I figured i had no option but though the A. Gotta check anyway.

>Paul_Avrin: AEILORS 12G .ARIOLES +70 317
#note out of the bag. Fantastic

>Nick: AEEENOW E4 AWEE +16 224
#note I never have any idea what to do in these situations. This sims just around the same as anything i guess, but I'm down at 1.5 win %. 
>Paul_Avrin: IOR A8 .ORI +13 330
#note I guess paul is most worried about a big z bingo.
>Nick: CENNOOV D1 OVEN +20 244
#note Happy I found this. 4% better win than any other play. 
>Paul_Avrin: EY 11K YE +22 352
>Nick: ?BCFINO 13M FOB +28 272
#note maybe FIB given pool. This still sims best though

>Paul_Avrin: EIT F2 TIE +8 360
>Nick: ?CGIINP 14B PI.ChING +74 346
>Paul_Avrin: EIILORS 15I OILER +9 369
#note he's got a bunch of easy out in twos.
>Nick: AAHSUW 9I AWASH +24 370
>Paul_Avrin: IS 12A SI +18 387
#note Where did this one go bad? Missing LATCH/NATCH was big. Nothing else screams out at me. DUMPY could have been wrong. The board actually wasn't too bad, and If I had just kept scoring a little more maybe things would have worked out. Missing QANAT too.
