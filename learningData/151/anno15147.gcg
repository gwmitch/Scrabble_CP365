>Kent: EEGNPR H3 PREEN..G +12 35
#note I was surprised to see this go down. But I'll take the open E.

>John: ACGINOR O1 CAG.R +24 152
#note Took me a while to even see the seven in this rack (which doesn't fit), but I was not keen on leaving the O triple lane open. Thought about COREIGN, but didn't like the volatility. Missed ANERGIC, and didn't even consider the N column (CAVING, e.g.). Went with the inferior CAGER.
>Kent: BOP 4C BOP +18 85
>John: DINOORT 6E DO +15 167
#note Wasted a lot of time in the previous turn, so after determing I had no bingo, I just played this one quickly. It seemed good enough; best is ORDO at 6J (for six points more).
>Kent: DELL 6K DELL +16 101
>John: IMNOORT C2 MO. +14 181
#note Again, played quickly to make up time. Best might be TOO at 7L.
>Kent: CG 3B C.G +9 110
>John: INOORTT B1 RO. +18 199
#note 7L TOO is still best, even better with this rack.
>Kent: AD A1 AD +21 131
>John: HINOTTV M1 NOV. +14 213
>Kent: IX I2 XI +15 146
>John: HIJSTTY J1 HIT +24 237
#note Was distracted by the X here. I didn't see the "offensive" play at J9, nor the play I would play next turn.
>Kent: AW L1 AW +14 160
#note He started to play near 10E, but changed his mind.
>John: IJSSTWY 10C TI.Y +30 267
#note Why I didn't play WINY or TWINY is beyond me. I probably played too quickly here.
>Kent: HU 8C HU. +9 169
>John: IJLSSSW J7 WIS +14 281
#note Starting to close off bingo lanes.
>Kent: U C8 .U. +7 176
>John: AJLORSS 12B JARS +33 314
#note Considered JARLS for 51, but stuck with the lower scoring, but less volatile play. I probably didn't have much to worry about here (my win % is over 99% either way).
>Kent: ?AEEIRT M6 .ITERAtE +68 244
>John: EFILOSS L12 IF +17 331
#note Saw FLOSSIE, but didn't think it was valid. I wasn't even sure whether LITERATE takes an S. Spent a few minutes on this play. After FLOSSIE, Q likes this second.
>Kent: IR 11L R.I +9 253
>John: ELNOOSS 14F LOOSENS +68 399
#note Wasn't 100% on whether RAI took an S, so I went with the surer play. Obviously playing at O8 is best.
>Kent: AELOTUU 13A TOLE +23 276
>John: ?EYZ H13 Z.o +33 432
#note Ha, I draw ?ZEY. I told Kent after the game that this wasn't fair. 
>Kent: AUU 8M .AU +9 285
#note A13 was the better place for it. Or ZA.
>John: EY B12 ..EY +28 460
#note I was already over time here, so I quickly played JOEY. Obviously YE at 14B is 11 points more. I lost 10 points for time. Final 452-285.
