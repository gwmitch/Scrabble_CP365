>Will: CFOORSY 8G FOY +18 18
>Kenji: ILMSTUZ G8 .UTZ +17 17
>Will: CDELORS J8 SCOLDER +74 92
#note Didn't take the time to look for CLOSURED, but it is clearly superior although SCOLDER sims slightly better. I really could have saved myself a lot of grief.
>Kenji: AILMOSU 14F SOLA.IUM +62 79
#note Also doesn't allow this, but that would just be gravy.
>Will: AEEIPRT 15L PEAT +38 130
#note PIER was the best option in that spot, but they all certainly are close. 
>Kenji: ?DEIRVW H12 WI.D +36 115
>Will: BEEILOR 11E BI. +28 158
#note This felt nearly forced but I missed BIREME/BERIME which I can do if I am scared about this board dying. Hard to know how strong Kenji is after WILD.  
>Kenji: ?AEMNRV O8 AVeRMEN. +95 210
#note I run well.
>Will: EELLORR 12B LORE +12 170
#note Yuck. What can I do here? I think E9 ROBLE is the play.  Kenji thinks I should play either ROLL n5 (preferably) or RELY i5.
>Kenji: BDEEINN N10 BEEN +29 239
>Will: EEGLORT 12H .O.GE +20 190
#note Maybe 7H GO now?  Kenji prefers EGO at 10.
>Kenji: AADIINV B10 VA.ID +34 273
>Will: EEELRTT 10A E.E +6 196
#note Desperation fork. If I can't score anything I might as well give this type of play a go.  Kenji thinks I should just take the points and kill the scoring spot.
>Kenji: ?AEIINN N2 bIENNIA +68 341
#note By the way, Will wasn't going to win this game no matter what...
>Will: ELPRTTU A5 PUTTE. +24 220
>Kenji: AQT A13 QAT +50 391
#note Unrecorded, but I'm pretty sure this is best almost no matter what my leave was, since I was U-less.
>Will: CGHHLRS C9 H.L.S +50 270
>Kenji: FO K10 FO. +23 414
#note Unrecorded
>Will: CGHJKRY 13G H.K. +41 311
>Kenji: DGINORX M6 OX +36 450
>Will: ACGJORY 4L JO.Y +36 347
>Kenji: DGINRUW O1 WIN. +33 483
>Will: AAACGNR B2 ARCANA +30 377
#note Quackle confirms my suspicion that I really need to block bingos with the lower scoring ARCANA against this frightening pool.
>Kenji: DEGRSTU D4 TRUDGES +84 567
#note Kenji had TRUDGEONS too though. I got Kenji'd.
>Kenji:  (GIIR) +10 577
