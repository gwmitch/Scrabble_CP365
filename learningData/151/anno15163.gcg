#note Nice find!!!!

#note There are misses and then there are MISSES.  You have to know it to play it - SOLONETZ plays at 10C for 89.  While the bingo is definitely best, this is the sort of miss that Chris Cree would say is a miss, not a MISS, as I'm scoring 53 and leaving myself EST.  Per the sim, this is the best of the rest.

>Jim_Burlant: DENOSTT C3 TOD +19 110
#note Or 7E HOT.  Q thinks that breaking up the rack for 34 with 11B TODS gives up too much bang for the buck.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?ADENRR I6 REyNARD +74 203
#note Another beautiful play by Jesse.  
>Jim_Burlant: ABEKNST G3 BEATN.KS +73 183
#note So far, I've played the best game I'm capable of.  And Quackle confirms what I was feeling - at this point of the game this had the ebb and flow where I felt like I was going to come up on the short end of a 950 or 1000-point shootout.  Per Q, I'm currently 28% to win.  If I'm going to get back into this game, Jesse has to take a break from the scoring.
>Jesse_Matthews: CDELRU 12D CURLE. +20 223
>Jim_Burlant: EGNRRUV 10G .U.VER +17 200
#note The old maxim:  find a good play, look for a better one.  I was going to put down EVER but felt the U had to be unloaded and I then found this.  This is best.  Creeping up - 31% to win from 28% a turn ago. 
>Jesse_Matthews: AAI L10 .AIA +8 231
>Jim_Burlant: AGIMNOR 7E .O. +15 215
#note Wasn't sure what to do initially.  I considered plays like OM H3 which do well statically, but shut things down too much.  11K plays looked to hurt more than help due to leave and board position.  Then I saw this.  E is the most probable tile in the pool, and if he defends the 2x2 with something at K11 as I suspect he will, BREAMING is a possibility if I land an E.  Even if I don't hit a bingo I'd be better served holding onto MARGIN so I could maybe play on row 4 with an EM word.  Quackle agrees - this is by far my best play.  7D OH is a 4-point dog.
>Jesse_Matthews: BF 11K F.B +26 257
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIMNR 3G .REAMING +78 293
#note Luck box!!!  Mangier also plays at B4 and J1 but this is best.  Too many points given up with the other choices.  63% to win.
>Jesse_Matthews: QT J2 Q.T +32 289
>Jim_Burlant: AHIILUY H12 .LHI +21 314
#note No really good options are available.  Most choices give back openings that are way too dangerous -  QUAI J2 gives back a huge J play (which is why I rejected it), and K3 MIAUL (which I rejected) keeps HY and gives back plays like SWEAR, SWEDE, etc. for huge points, and with 24 in the bag it's more and more likely he has at least one of the major threats.  As for this - it scores as well as almost anything else that unloads an I, unloads the H and a duplicated I and doesn't create any bingo threats that I think are *that* juicy given the pool and its overload of E's.  That said, this is a so-so play and the leave is awful.  Best option looks to be a play I missed, 6B AYIN.
>Jesse_Matthews: EGIIPST F11 G.IP +13 302
#note His rack, and this cost him the game.  He talked himself out of PIGGIEST on this turn.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIMUY M13 YUM +26 340
#note Q wants me to live dangerously with a word I've never seen - N1 MAGUEY for 40. Of the available choices, K2 IMAUM looks good, and I've got the Y to score at M13 for the next turn.  This is decent choice, but not best.  But I benefit from this miss, as you'll see in a second.
>Jesse_Matthews: AP 15M .AP +21 323
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIJOU 2J .UAI +21 361
#note Now that I've got the J, I'll play QUAI to set up JOE coming back at M1.  Q agrees - this is best.  This wins 71%.  For reference, burning the J with 15D JOE wins 8% less often.
>Jesse_Matthews: AEEIIST N3 .AIETIES +63 386
>Jim_Burlant: DEJOORW 1M JOW +49 410
#note Best, and it's not even close.  For reference - JEW, which I considered due to the overload of E's in the pool, wins 7% less often and is an 8 point dog.  80% to win, and my next rack makes that 100.
>Jesse_Matthews: ESW 5J SEW +25 411
>Jim_Burlant: DEEENOR 15A REDONE +32 442
#note Practically any acceptable play wins the game, but this is best - it blocks his CIVET out. 
>Jesse_Matthews: CETV 8M V.E +18 429
>Jim_Burlant: E 14F .E. +8 450
#note Outside of missing a bingo I didn't know, the only real mistake I made was ELHI, and that came on a turn where there really were no great options.  I'm quite happy with this one. And yeah, drawing the right end rack didn't hurt, either.
