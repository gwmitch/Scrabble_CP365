#note is this an overreaction? i really wanted to just play WAVER. WATT sims best without an inference. what kind of ranges could i try here? (-0.5)

#note blah. i think this looks right though, especially if he has 1-point tiles... let's hope he doesn't hit anything. OUTRIG is reasonable too but scores too little.

#note it's unfortunate that this is far away the best equity play. i'll have to worry about opening the board later.

#note i have no idea why i was unable to see the other VEE. quackle likes SEEP best at 15E.. probably looks ok too. (-8)

#note i totally missed OLEInES! lame!! VOLErIES is a little better than my bingo, too. i wanted a few more points but this is giving up so much. AISLE sims best from 15K. (-1.5)

#note another mistake, thought of KNIT first but didn't consider the bag. most of this tournament i was looking carefully at the pool but i was kind of agitated this game mainly because joey makes thirty turns a minute. (-2)

>cesar: ADEMNRT 4C TANDEM +31 292
#note is ANTRUM better here? i was just trying to score, but TANDEM allows cheap comebacks. (-2.5)

#note case in point
>cesar: ACGORRT C1 GRO. +10 302
#note i spent most of my remaining time on this lame move. it is imperative that i play at C13 with RUG. i need to take the best consonant dumping spot here as he is extremely likely to be consonant heavy. 3A GRAT sims ok too. this move should be shot, but i would be a genius if the extra tile i drew from GROT vs RUG was an A. (-7.5)

#note gah.
>cesar: ACNRRST D3 R.N +5 307
#note i saw NARC. just don't even ask. i was way too focused on CATAMITE for some ridiculously stupid reason. with NARC i have a small chance of winning.
