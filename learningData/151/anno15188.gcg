>Will: AEHIJRU 15I JAU. +15 140
#note I overestimated the value of blocking the K afforded by JAUK compared to the better score and still useful defensive property (blocking the S in the triple lane) of JEHUS.

#note Probably G9 VAGI instead, though AEINRS hits a decent amount in a bunch of places.
>Lou: DY E10 D.Y +12 233
>Will: AEEINRS L6 NE.A +12 229
#note This sims poorly, but I don't mind it that much...alternatively I can play 9K NAE and just try to keep scoring.
>Lou: DY 9K D.Y +28 261
>Will: EEIQRST -Q +0 229
#note If Lou can't block NEMA this hits 26/34 times with ENEMA and 9/34 times with the R of REGIVE.

>Will: EEIRSTU J11 .U. +4 233
#note Bricked.
>Lou: FOPR 6F PROF +28 297
>Will: DEEIRST 12C R.. +6 239
#note Flailing now. I should play 10J DE to score well and delay opening until a future turn.
>Lou: AEL N10 ALE +12 309
>Will: DEEISTT 5J TIE +13 252
#note Considered TRAY but B10 ZIT or QAT would be disastrous. I might have to risk it. Taking 24 for DE might be fine here as well, though there's only so many turns I can delay.

>Lou: AHILP A4 PHIAL +49 367
>Will: ENNOQTU 4A .ONENT +16 338
#note No wins, but if Lou mistracks and misses QUA somehow I can win if he blocks QAT. This was a frustrating game that I also played weakly.
