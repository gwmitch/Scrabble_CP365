>Will: ACEGIKM 8G MAGICK +40 40
#note I thought this would be quite a heroic challenge, so I slapped it down pretty fast.
>Jim: EHIM K8 .HIME +24 24
>Will: AAEEINV 7E VEENA +21 61
#note The sanest option.
>Jim: EF L11 EF +24 48
>Will: ADDIJSZ 6H ADZ +41 102
#note Whiff on ZADDIK but I definitely think ADZ is better in a vacuum - only question is whether I give Jim credit for TZADDIK (I think I would have).
>Jim: EF K5 FE +24 72
>Will: ?DIIJSS -JI +0 102
#note Ugh. 13I JASSID. I played the same word in a very similar circumstance earlier this year, too. Not a huge fan of these J? leaving plays, but playing something must still be better.
>Jim: AEGOSTW 9A STOWAGE +69 141
#note Disheartening to not see TOWAGES/MAGICKS* here.
>Will: ?DEIISS A6 DIS.EISe +77 179
#note Next scheme - draw case S and set up DISSEISEE megahooks.

>Will: AILORRU O1 ROIL +22 298
#note M3 URIAL by a mile. It even sets up the O though the spot will be taken one way or another a lot of the time. Darn.
>Jim: BHLU D12 BUHL +34 312
>Will: AIOORSU 15D .OUR +4 302
#note I liked inducing weak blocks here, though I can also do 13I OUR for the highest scoring play, F9 GOO, or 14B to address C12 AX or worse X plays (though it creates a similarly strong X spot). Still hoping for an E to threaten a 40 point DISSEISEES/SI type play (most ideally EATH), so I didn't go with OOH here. OUR sims best on all settings, but LOUR is pretty close behind.
>Jim: AEVW G11 WAVE. +15 327
>Will: AIIORSU 13G .AU +7 309
#note 13G VIRUS is the play I needed here, scoring more and reaching further into the bag. Needed to shift gears away from my S setup and onto landing the X.
>Jim: JOT B5 JOT +19 346
>Will: IIINORS 5B .OIN +22 331
#note Making a second spot. Really need to draw it now.
>Jim: ATX C11 TAX +46 392
>Will: ABIIRST 6M I. +2 333
#note Maybe TIBIAS to cut spread? Who knows what might happen here, so I didn't give up.
>Jim: ADEINNR H12 R.N +9 401
>Will: ABILRST 4D BIRL +22 355
#note Not best, missed STY. Time trouble. Tough game, JASSID and URIAL more than outweighed anything good I did here.
