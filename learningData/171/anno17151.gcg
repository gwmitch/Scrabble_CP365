>Tasha: EEGNQRU 8D QUERN +48 48
#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures Episode 14.  I missed bingos every turn this game.  Anyways,  I was going to play QUEEN, but as I was laying down Q-U-E, my hands just picked up RN and plays those letters instead.  My play sims better than QUEEN, but is slightly below QUEER.  I guess QUEER sims best because of the possibility of hitting an ING bingo through one of the open Es on the board.  I personally like QUERN best.
>Josephine_Flowers: HI 9C HI +20 20
>Tasha: EEEGOST G6 GO.E +7 55
#note I was tempted to play B8 OGEE for the leave, but I couldn't justify doing that after Josephine plays HI after almost a minute of thinking.  I thought of playing it at 9H instead, but leaving a 2x2 open after a two-tile play is just as bad as leaving a triple lane open.  After a bit, I just decided to try to find the most annoying play I could think of and so I decided on GORE because it takes out three bingo lanes and limits the S hook on row 10.
>Josephine_Flowers: IV 6E VI. +9 29
>Tasha: EEFLSTT F8 .FT +13 68
#note I saw both bingos here, but unfortunately, I thought they were both phonies because the alphagram didn't look familiar.  I talked myself out of LEFTEST.  "Well, RIGHTEST is good so why wouldn't LEFTEST be?  ...Nah, Tasha, don't be ridiculous.  You're obviously confusing this with LEFTIST."  And FETTLES just sounds phonier than a four dollar bill.

>Tasha: EEILSTT 13C TI.E +10 78
#note That's two in a row folks.  I saw ENTITLES and other 8s, but failed to notice that's there's a perfectly open N for the taking.  That's just poor board vision.

>Tasha: ?EEINOX 14F XI +50 210
#note The only play I considered was 1A EXOGENIC* and I'm glad I decided that was phony.  After my correct decision, I stopped looking for bingos as bingoing is wrong because I have a blank and an easy 50 at 14F.

#note Blocking LOZENGE, but giving me another bingo....
>Tasha: ?EEGNOZ A7 ZON.E +42 252
#note ....that I missed.  At least it wasn't a 3x3.

#note Aren't I sexy?  I'm doing my best Andrew imitation here.  Granted, he probably wouldn't have missed COZENAGE last turn, but that's beside the point because I wasn't imitating him then. 
>Josephine_Flowers: LL D12 ..LL +7 161
>Tasha: AABEHOY 8L OBEY +33 382
#note I considered three plays here:  AYAH, OBEY, and 2F HAUTBOY.   I decided that HAUTBOY is just me trying to be cute.  There's really no point to that play.  I played OBEY over AYAH because I wanted to put a harder tile for Josephine to bingo through on column O.  Had I seen AHOY, I would have played that instead.  Funny thing is OBEY is actually Championship Player's top play but it's near the bottom when you run the sim.

>Tasha: AEFIOOS O13 FOE +26 464
#note There's two tiles in the bag and they're most likely to be consonants.  Or at least they better be two consonants.  Maybe I'll draw one V and one  C, but since Josephine just bingoed I'm pretty confident she just pulled AEIU out of the bag.  Anyways, I played N2 OF and take my tiles back.  Then I played M11 OAF and take my tiles back again while mumbling "that's worse."  Josephine was probably wondering what the hell I'm doing.  N2 OI sims best and I saw that play put quickly dismissed it.  I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to be getting rid of the F AND one of my Os since there's two consonants in the bag.  I missed N1 OAFS but I probably wouldn't have played it because I want to keep my S.   I can play a decent endgame as long as I don't draw V-V.

#note I think I'm getting the hang of this endgame stuff.  My pre-endgame has also gotten better.  I'm improving! :D
