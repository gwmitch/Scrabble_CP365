>Adam_Ginzberg: EGGOU G3 GOUGE. +11 65
#note I thought GOUGERE# might be good, but it's only a type of pastry in CSW.
>JD: EILNOTT H1 LION +21 73
#note bad play, sort of gave up on finding something decent but ELUTION is much better

>JD: BKNRTTU E7 B.T.N +20 142
#note randomly terrible play here, for some reason completely missed on MAWN. worst play of the day that wasn't missing a bingo
>Adam_Ginzberg: AVV A13 VAV +37 231
>JD: DHKNRTU I10 THUNK. +13 155
#note I wonder if adam was surprised at me passing up 30 points to make this play!!
>Adam_Ginzberg: AQT 9C Q.. +43 274
>JD: ADEEFIR 6J FADE +34 189
#note playing FAIRED here looks reasonable, great pool and might be more difficult to block. this will allow him to close just by playing on column N.

>Adam_Ginzberg: ?GINNSS --  -77 342
#note he actually has consigns here.
>JD: ACIOOOS 11I .AO +24 243
#note if he sees CONSIGNS I should block with COCOA, but counter-fishing by playing OHO would be fine.
>Adam_Ginzberg: ?GINNSS 2H .NS +5 347
>JD: CEEIOOS 10K COOEE +16 259
#note COOEE drops his bingo percentage to 36%, but just playing COO cuts it even further to 26% and allows me to fish for something of my own.
>Adam_Ginzberg: ?EGINRS O7 S.R.ElING +77 424
#note one of my lowest scores in a long time, but totally self-inflicted by somehow spacing on mawn.
>Adam_Ginzberg:  (AIISZ) +28 452
