#note unfortunately for me, conrad had never seen IRIDIAL# so this was an easy challenge for him. win percentage drops from 10% with DULIA to about 4%.

>Jesse: DHIIIPT L5 .IPID +9 107
#note I have DHUTI for 30 on the left, which I missed. I clearly need the points, but he may have to sacrifice a lot of points to block the triple, too, and if he doesn't I always have an easy way back in the game. PADRI at E7 looks like the play to me.
>dacrON: AAEEFMO 3I F.AME +28 272
#note C10 (C)AMEO destroys the sim. I think I autopiloted a bit here because Jesse always comes back on me when I have huge leads.
>Jesse: AEHIPTT E5 HET.I.A +46 153
#note aaaaand here I miss a bingo while thinking I was being clever. it's not like I don't know thiotepa, just didn't look hard enough apparently.
>dacrON: AENOOTU B8 TO.NEAU +14 286
#note If I could go back in time, I think I'd have played TAUON if I had seen it. That said, I was worried I way overthought this play. It's winning the sim, but I'm not so sure...
>Jesse: INOPRTX F4 POX +58 211
>dacrON: BEOOQSY D2 BOYOS +36 322
#note I would've played A9 B(U)OY had I seen it. This is still probably the right play though...?
>Jesse: EIINNRT 12F IN.ERTIN +72 283
>dacrON: EEJLQSS A4 JESSE +66 388
#note :). I think this is worth the 2 point sacrifice.
>Jesse: AALMNUW C1 MAW +30 313
#note I'm pretty much toast by this point - one play at the bottom-right will take down all my lanes. I was hoping to draw a Q bingo like QUINELLA but rarely will it actually go down.
>dacrON: EGLLQTV N12 GELT +23 411
#note I had thought there was another G unseen, so I wasn't blocking as much as I thought. I'm probably mostly safe after the simple 13A Q(A)T, but in this game situation, spread was irrelevant, so I was trying to avoid any miracles I didn't see.
>Jesse: AELNOTU B1 UNTO +37 350
#note yup, definitely mistracked that T.
>dacrON: CEILQVW 11L QI +24 435
#note I didn't bother to add up VIEW/(LIPID)E. It's one better.
>Jesse: ABELR J10 BA.REL +16 366
#note Correct endgame.
>Jesse:  (CELVW) +26 392
#note All in all, a reasonably successful day, I think. 4th place, which I'll take, and overall made lots of good decisions.
