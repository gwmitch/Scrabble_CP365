#note i was literally crossing my fingers for him to leave the O open for bullfrog.

>cesar: ?BEEILR -  +0 36
#note this is not one of my proudest moments. jerry has played too many phonies on me over the ages that i've let him had, and i've resolved to not let that happen again. and then i go and challenge a very high prob word. once i thought of DIATOMS, i thought "oh, that doesn't have an anagram", despite MASTOID looking incredibly familiar.

#note libeler is definitely better. (-5)

#note quackle thinks i should just throw away the rack keeping ET, by a litlte bit of win% (about -0.5%)

#note i seem to be in trouble here. quackle prefers a bunch of 3A 3-letter words to my play, by a little bit. i think 3A GUN makes sense. (-2.5)
>jerry: JOT 3C JOT +52 246
#note that's another reason i should play there that i didn't think of. it's a big scoring opportunity.

#note keeping EH is the winner. by quite a bit. actually, i was pretty sure i kept EH here, but my sheet says exch 6 and i didn't have the H next turn. i think i was too flustered. (-4)

>cesar: ACEELST 8C LACE..... +19 295
#note this is not the right play, 11B CEL seems a little better (same score and a better leave), and 13B COXES is another interesting choice. i don't know if i was subconsciously hoping for a challenge or what. (-0.5%)

#note i am the luckiest person on earth. he actually didn't hold me on whitneys* and i basically played it because i had no other choice. jerry was very low on time and must have gotten a little flustered himself. i don't really deserve this game after mastoid.
