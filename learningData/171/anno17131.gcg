#note i shouldn't spend so long deciding whether to play LEUKOIDS*. i don't know where that "word" came from. i was pretty close to pulling the trigger on it too. i don't like KUDO that much, but quackle thinks QUOD gives up even more, which i couldn't really see. also it's one more oint. (-4)

#note is ZEALS or LAZES better? what do people play? 
>ginzberg: ADIORST A6 DI.ATORS +60 107
#note i chose wrong. also, at this point adam started speed playing me. i spent too long on QUOD and KEET and towards the end of this game i was in very severe time trouble!

#note i am basically too chicken to ever make a play like 3D PIU. i wonder how to retrain my brain to take more risks. (-6.5)

#note i passed up UnIPOLAR rightly although i was getting pretty low on time. i spent more time here looking for other bingos and missed PROcURAL which seems much better than unipolar. OUR is a good fish though.  (-3)

#note i thought about playing POLYfACE* (you know, more than one uniface...) i did see CALOtYPE and missed COPYAbLE. challenging off the phony has got to be much better in any case, i was close to 100% sure it was phony.

#note i was super low on time now and missing bingos left and right. i would probably find ADULtERY if i had more time. (-16)

>cesar: ?AEHILR 7H L.AcHIER +63 315
#note i was like at 3 minutes here and he's instantly making moves. i really should find the other three bingos here though. i remember seeing HAULIER but didn't notice it fit. i get so flustered when i'm low on time. don't speed-play me pls. (-19)

#note GNU is much better, but at this point i literally had like 12 seconds. (-15)
>ginzberg: EGNNT F10 GN. +20 349
>cesar: EGNO J13 EG. +25 390
#note lol i missed both my outs. also if he had played here i probably wouldn't have seen GNU. but maybe i would have gone over-time and seen GENOA. (-15)
>ginzberg: ENT J2 ETN. +6 355
#note GRIFF takes an E???
>ginzberg:  (NO) +4 359
#note the moral of the story here is to not let myself get under time pressure so early or i start missing everything. didn't i use to be ok at speed games back in the day?
