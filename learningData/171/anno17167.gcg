>Dielle: AFLX 8F FLAX +28 28
>JD: ACEFHIO 7F OAF +20 20
#note an interesting rack with lots of options, I loved OAF because it makes her next play so tricky. but OHIA, AHI and FOE all sim within a point. when all is said and done I think I like the defensive option here.
>Dielle: IORT 9G TRIO +26 54
>JD: ?CEEHIJ 10J HIC +29 49
#note very close sim between HIC and HIE, I figured I would continue with the defensive trend even though CJ don't go together very well.
>Dielle: WZ G6 W...Z +17 71
>JD: ?EEJSTT L7 EJE.TS +46 95
#note would you try jetsets?? it was blocked anyway so moot point
>Dielle: EER 8L .EER +33 104
>JD: ?ADIIOT M1 IODInAT. +71 166
#note better defense at N1.
>Dielle: IQ L4 QI +45 149
>JD: AEGHINU K5 HUG +28 194
#note I really need to block row 1, just AHING is fine

#note dielle also challenged because she had this fantastic play, her only available bingo.
>JD: DDEERSU G6 .....ED +20 272
#note my best play here, opening some lanes I might need. Q says only 20% to win but at least the board is now wide open.
>Dielle: NO N14 NO +10 329
#note I wonder how much she sacrificed to block KAINS?
>JD: ADEORSU 3C SA.OURED +78 350
>Dielle: EL J1 LE. +6 335
#note I managed to get dielle into time pressure starting around this point in the game, which really helped.
>JD: EGGINTU H1 GU.GE +27 377
#note I really liked giving myself a potential -ING bingo, since it seems really likely she will bingo soon.
