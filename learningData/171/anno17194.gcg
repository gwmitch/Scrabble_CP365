>Siddharth_Murali: ABIORST 8G BO +8 8
>Eric_Hashbarger: ?EELMRT H8 .vERMELT +86 86
#note (BO)LoMETER. Holy shit.
>Siddharth_Murali: AINRSTZ -Z +0 8
#note Just kill me lol... 
>Eric_Hashbarger: ADKOV 7C VODKA +23 109
>Siddharth_Murali: AIINRST 13C RAINI.ST +70 78
#note I felt I could work with a semi-bad board here. That's why I didn't choose the north-pole play with VITRAINS or the south-pole play with MARTINIS. They're all super close
>Eric_Hashbarger: ADENOPP 11G P.OPANED +76 185
#note Fuck... 
>Siddharth_Murali: GHJLRUW D10 JUG.L +26 104
#note Sims best.
>Eric_Hashbarger: AEU 12J EAU +17 202
>Siddharth_Murali: BHORRTW D4 THR.W +30 134
#note Sims better than BORROW for some weird reason. What a pleasant surprise.
>Eric_Hashbarger: IQ C3 QI +24 226
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ABCORS I2 BOxCARS +67 201
#note Damn. This and BROCADES were the only bingos I knew. CRAMBOS for 85 is best. However, I didn't even consider CARBO/CRABS. (-11%)
>Eric_Hashbarger: ELY J1 LYE +31 257
#note This man is too good
>Siddharth_Murali: AIRSTWX B4 WAX +35 236
#note Best equity plsy. Thought this was necessary to force him to block because Eric is super defensive when ahead. Sim says the other WAX by 3%, which I didn't even see.
>Eric_Hashbarger: DEGNRST 6G DR.GNETS +72 329
#note Alrighty. Keep bingoing, sir.
>Siddharth_Murali: EIIRSTU A6 ETUI +21 257
#note Sims best, but this only wins 5%. I didn't feel like Eric should take 40 free points, even when I'm behind. The other options are UI fishes for 3 points. Blah.
>Eric_Hashbarger: EFHOOOU E4 HOE. +38 367
#note Actual rack. I blocked HOOF for 44.
>Siddharth_Murali: EEIIRSV M2 VERI.IES +76 333
>Eric_Hashbarger: AZ H1 ZA +41 408
#note Damn, my second play was like the worst play of the tournament, and now I feel like a total idiot.
>Siddharth_Murali: CILNNOY E9 YON +25 358
#note Q puts this neck and neck with CONY and CORNY.
>Eric_Hashbarger: FOU 15H .OFU +7 415
>Siddharth_Murali: ACGIILN 8L C.IL +27 385
#note My thinking is just to take this spot and try and hope I have some bingo on the left that he wouldn't see. VAC won't win 11% as quackle suggests.
>Eric_Hashbarger: AEFINOT 14B FE.T +18 433
#note He didn't see any bingos but just decided to be safe.
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEGIMN F9 AG +27 412
#note I didn't see the word NAOI on his rack, shit, so I decided to play this first and MINED in two spots next. I should just maximize points/playback with GAMED, obviously.
>Eric_Hashbarger: AINO 13L NAOI +11 444
#note This game was filled with word knowledge/anagramming mistakes. Strategically, I don't think I did too much wrong, but I can't afford these games if I ever want to become good.
