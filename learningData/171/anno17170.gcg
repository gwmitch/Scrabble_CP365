#note I liked keeping GIT trying to hit a bingo at G2 (-TING). bingo percentage is 26%, higher than any other play.

#note setting up his O, I presume

#note quackle hates this play relative to UTOPIA at D1. However, I wanted to keep the board more closed and liked my shot at a -ATING bingo for next turn (only 25% though according to quackle). In addition, this move, which I took a long time on, should look a lot like a J or X setup that Seth will have to sacrifice points to block. If he has the J or X I just gave him free points, but that's not that likely - neither tile was on his rack last turn, given LAUGH (he would've scored more in all likelihood), so he has about a 1 in 8 chance of having one of those tiles. when all's said and done I like this play!

#note stupidly, I DID draw the bingo and then missed it!! I saw GOATSKIN about two turns later. bad miss, although I am still in good shape.

#note quackle likes FA at K10. a bit surprising but AXIOM gives potential free plays on column O and leaves a clunky leave.

>Seth: DEIJV 15D JIVE. +24 313
#note I don't know where else he could've played, but this blocks the lanes he probably needs to mount a comeback
>JD: ABEHOOU N1 OOH +27 378
#note I wanted to block cheap Z plays over here.
>Seth: I C2 I. +5 318
>JD: ABEEEIU I11 A.E +16 394
#note ACE drops his bingo percentage to below 1%. the play to be scared of here is ZARF (he's probably not fishing for FANTAILED through AN) but ACE should block bingos and still be able to outrun.

#note I was pretty low on time and came up with a really bad option - kibei is the play
