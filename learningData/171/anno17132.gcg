#note unfortunately i got greedy here. to be honest i was actually only like 20% certain on it being a word, so there's absolutely no reason to play it here and he insta challenged. i'm still a good shot to win with the final blank, but i can't be doing stuff like this.

#note i missed GINGELEY, and that is actually one of those words i've always wanted to play. if i had thought of the word i would have seen it right away, but it's too low prob to recognize it from the alphagram. :( (-13) also TYE at 15H, but i was worrying about an ING bingo or something.

#note now i am feeling a bit on alert because his bingo seems imminent, and i just want to play something i'm 100% sure of. so i miss FRIJOLE and PROFILE :/ also, i was getting low on time as always. (-5)
