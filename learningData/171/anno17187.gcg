#note My eyes lit up when I saw the triple letter open up...
>Bruce: EINORTY 11D TONIER +23 66
#note He flashed a y.  Going from toney to tonier. 
>Brett: CHILNRR 8J RICH +22 107
#note This is the top play...getting rid of the double r.  However it's too easy to extend.  I thought about lich instead.  Not sure if he knew the lichee, lichen, lichis, lichts....
>Bruce: ELRY 8J ....ER +33 99
#note Too easy.  He said he had richly too. 
>Brett: ACEFLNR 12C CAFE +29 136
#note Not wild about this move.  
>Bruce: INOY 12I YONI +22 121
>Brett: EHILNRS L11 N.L +3 139
#note Just trying to set up since it feels close.  This move isn't even on Q's radar.  EH at 11K isn't too bad
>Bruce: EJNOU L4 JOUN.E +30 151
>Brett: AEHIINS G5 AI +8 147
#note Once again, not on the radar.  Just trying to create a lane while keeping nil open.  
>Bruce: AELPT H1 PETAL +26 177
>Brett: EHILRSU 14I HURLIES +78 225
#note Wasn't sure of hurlies but it's good.  A hurley is a commotion.  Didn't recall (P)LUSHIER at 1H...  
>Bruce: ?AEIPTV 15E PrIVATE +92 269
#note Privater at O1 for a few more pts.
>Brett: DLR 5K L.RD +10 235
#note This move will come back to haunt me...
>Bruce: DEIO N2 DIO.E +18 287
>Brett: ?EEGRZ O12 ZE.t +66 301
#note couldn't decide whether to burn the blank or go ahead and play play geez.  Q prefers geez.

>Brett: AAASUVW E3 VAWS +27 352
#note dumb move!  Time pressure and wasn't tracking.  Had him Q stuck but decided to allow him to play it.  So nice of me!  Saw the Caw, then Vas play...but my tracking was so crappy I wasn't sure how good his rack was.
