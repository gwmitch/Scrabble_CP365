>Matthew_Larocque: AAAENOV 8H AVA +12 12
#note Maybe AAEN is better than AEON? 
>Steve_Glass: DZ J8 .DZ +33 33
>Matthew_Larocque: AEKNNOR 11I KENO +30 42
#note Tight sim. I forgot KRONEN though, which gets more turnover if I want to go that route.
>Steve_Glass: AAH 12K AHA +24 57
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILNRW G5 WAIL +15 57
#note Burned more time here than I should have, at least the Z is gone so I don't have to worry about that. I almost played WIN 13M but figured it was a little early for those kinds of shenanigans.
>Steve_Glass: UUUUV -UUUUV +0 57
>Matthew_Larocque: BEINNRR H1 BRINE +29 86
#note BRANNIER? I mean I don't actually know any eights so this isn't that surprising. I also folded on BRINER since it would have been a blind guess.
>Steve_Glass: CEMOT F2 COMET +27 84
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINRRT 4C GRI. +14 100
#note Quackle likes fishing here with the ING synergy, I can't really argue because I can't score any points anyways.
>Steve_Glass: EEHOSU 2H .EHOUSE +36 120
>Matthew_Larocque: ENOPRTU 13J UPON +27 127
>Steve_Glass: ?AGRSTU 14E RAGoUTS +71 191
#note His highest scoring bingo is O2 dUSTRAG, a word that doesn't even look familiar to me.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILRTT N1 R.TITLED +61 188
#note Fortunately I get to play this...
>Steve_Glass: EITU O8 ETUI +21 212
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEEILQ L1 Q.ID +48 236
>Steve_Glass: OY 15G OY +30 242
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEILRV O1 ED +27 263
#note Wait what, DRIVEL mean to drool? Sheesh. 
>Steve_Glass: ?FIINOR E7 INFeRIO. +70 312
#note Because the word was upside down I misread it and called a hold, Steve gave me the biggest WTF look haha.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFILRV F9 EF +30 293
>Steve_Glass: BCOWY 13A COWB.Y +37 349
>Matthew_Larocque: EILORTV A7 VOLTRI.E +92 385
>Matthew_Larocque: EILORTV --  -92 293
#note LOL! I don't even know. I don't even know. Just play OVERTOIL and make it respectable. I do stupid things when I don't think. 
>Steve_Glass: AEMSX K4 EXAMS +39 388
>Matthew_Larocque: EILORTV B8 OVERT.IL +76 369
#note Steve was generous and gave me another crack at it. Then wisely told me that I should have just played it the first time. 
>Steve_Glass: AEGJNPS A4 JAPES +72 460
>Matthew_Larocque: ALN J5 AL +17 386
#note 5 ways to go out, and no time to see any of them.
>Steve_Glass: GN H7 N.G +6 466
>Steve_Glass:  (N) +2 468
#note We recorded his score as 476. Actually not too bad considering I had but a measly Q and missed bingos - if I play DRIVELER it actually would have been semi-close!
