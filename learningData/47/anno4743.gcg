>Steve: AAEFLSV 8D FAVELAS +84 84
#note Matt said during the game he thought this to be a phony, but in the end rightly decided not to challenge.
>Matt: ?AEEEHT H1 ETHErEA. +83 83
>Steve: IJLOQRZ G7 Z.RO +45 129
>Matt: ABW F10 WAB +29 112
>Steve: EIIJLQU 12D JI. +24 153
>Matt: AIKORT H10 TROIKA +39 151
>Steve: DEILQUU J8 .UQ +32 185
#note Duck likes 2H TUQUE. Seems foolhardy. I debated between this and LIQUEUR.
>Matt: EWY 9C YEW +23 174
>Steve: DEFILPU 5G P.IDEFUL +76 261
#note One of two available bingos, and best. The other one is more difficult to see, to my eye.
>Matt: SX I7 S.X +49 223
#note This doesn't bode well, as he probably is holding back another S.
>Steve: GILOTUY N2 GUL.Y +34 295
#note GLUILY or UGLILY in the same spot is a bit better. 
>Matt: ADIV O6 AVID +29 252
>Steve: INOOOPT N9 OPTION +31 326
>Matt: ?EIILNT 15H .LIENIsT +82 334
>Steve: BGIMMOT O1 MOM +28 354
#note Q likes adding the I at the end for nine more points. Felt I needed to keep back a vowel.
>Matt: DNOS 13C NODS +31 365
>Steve: BGIOTTU 14B BUG +25 379
>Matt: AHR M1 RAH +32 397
>Steve: EEIORTT L4 E.T +12 391
#note All the top plays use three tiles, making the opponent empty the bag if he bingos. I almost went with TOE at 1i, but Q plays it balls to the wall and plays it at 10A.
>Matt: ACDEINR 3C INARC.ED +86 483
>Steve: EGINORT G3 .O. +9 400
#note I fish because I missed the bingo. It's one I've missed multiple times, hopefully this is the last time. Still would have lost, but would have picked up another $10 for hi loss.
>Matt: ACENORS 15A CENSOR +47 530
>Steve: EEGINRT 4A GENET +24 424
#note Went a minute over on time, too, trying to devise a possible unblockable bingo at the end.
