#note I was pretty sure this wasn't good, but thought it worth the gambit. It almost worked. Darin said afterwards he realized he had a mnemonic for the RATIONS stem at the last minute, something like 'Joe sculpted dog.' That doesn't include the W, but maybe he had it before the update.
>Darin: ?AEFGMU J2 FUMiGA.E +75 97
#note This is a fine hole I've dug myself in to.
>Steve: AIKNORS 10F KAINS +37 37
#note Right idea, althou KINOS in the same spot is deemed superior by 10 points in valuation and three percentage points.
>Darin: CNZ 5I Z.NC +28 125
>Steve: ANOORSW 11E RAW +23 60
#note The simple WOOS/ZINCS is best. Getting behind big early often leads to equity mistakes like this.
>Darin: EU L4 E.U +10 135
>Steve: INOOQSX I2 OX +39 99
>Darin: EINNORT 12F TERNION +79 214
#note Darin's fish pays dividends.
>Steve: ABINOQS 1G QIS +46 145
#note I was tempted to set up the Q with BANI 11K, but rightly played it straight.
>Darin: AHO 11K HAO +24 238
>Steve: AABLNOU 13K BANAL +25 170
#note Felt I needed to open it up, being so far behind. Q likes 13L ABO.
>Darin: ADEERST O8 TREAD.ES +149 387
#note Bad timing on my part, and as it's been said, timing is everything. Darin took all of half a second to find this.
>Steve: IOPRTUY M1 POUTY +40 210
#note Best if you don't find the bingo, which is new to me.

#note EPILOG.
>Darin: OY N9 OY +28 461
#note Oy, indeed.
>Steve: EEGIPUV M7 VUG +19 293
#note Duck ditches the duplicate E with VEG.
>Darin: DO 1M .OD +18 479
>Steve: AEEIMPT 2L M.PE +27 320
#note I knew Darin was fishing for a bingo, but the board didn't look that bingo friendly. Wrong again.
>Darin: ?DEELOS E2 .OLDEyES +68 547
>Steve: AEEINTT D3 TEEN +19 339
#note I went a minute over trying to block the outs I saw, but there's no way to do it.
