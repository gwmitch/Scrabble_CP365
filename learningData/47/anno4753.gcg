>Gregg_Speicher: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 0
>Matt_Canik: AIIOOOV -AIIOOOV +0 0
#note Yeah. Pretty obvious choice here. 
>Gregg_Speicher: BEKOR 8D BROKE +28 28
>Matt_Canik: EEIIOOW -EIIOOW +0 0
#note Chickened out on WOOE(R) but I like exchanging here more anyway. Having 2 Is sucks. 
>Gregg_Speicher: ADEI 9G IDEA +17 45
>Matt_Canik: EILOPST E4 POIT.ELS +90 90
#note Yeah, this rack is a little bit better. 
>Gregg_Speicher: DIINOSU K3 NIDIOUS +72 117
>Gregg_Speicher: DIINOSU --  -72 45
#note Nice try. 
>Matt_Canik: FGIIORT F2 GRIFT +28 118
#note Sims #1. Quackle likes IF F5 almost as much. 
>Gregg_Speicher: DIINOSU 10J DINO +16 61
>Matt_Canik: ACINOQW 2A COWIN. +24 142
#note This and a lot of other plays are really close, but QA(T) 7C sims above the rest by percentage points. 
>Gregg_Speicher: HIJ J6 JIH.. +32 93
#note Nice spot, I probably wouldn't have seen this. 
>Matt_Canik: AEENQUZ 10B QUA.E +36 178
#note Was so fixated on dumping the Q that I overlooked Z(O)NAE or Z(O)EAE. This is only 1% worse, though. 
>Gregg_Speicher: AW C2 .AW +18 111
>Matt_Canik: ?EHLNTZ A1 E.HT +30 208
#note D'oh. ZEN(IT)H was best, but this sims 2nd. 
>Gregg_Speicher: EERU B10 .UEER +28 139
>Matt_Canik: INZ 12A Z.IN +46 254
#note Missed the rack. :(
>Gregg_Speicher: ACFL M9 F.CAL +28 167
>Matt_Canik: ?ALMSTT K8 AL.T +19 273
#note OUCH. ToTAL(I)SM/Jo/IT/HA/IDEAL for 107 would have been sweet. Looked for a while, but wasn't looking for bingos there. Also missed SToMAT(A)L. 
>Gregg_Speicher: AIMSTU L3 AUTISM +33 200
>Matt_Canik: ?IMNOST 15B SeNTIMO +92 365
#note MOISTen(ED) was tempting (also MONeTIS(ED) and MISaTON(ED) which I didn't see) but this is best. 
>Gregg_Speicher: DOR 14H DOR +9 209
#note Don't really know what this was about... closes a lane whereas M1 would have opened one. 
>Matt_Canik: ABGOPVY 13G PAY +28 393
#note GYP M2 was probably better. 
>Gregg_Speicher: EE 13G ...EE +12 221
>Matt_Canik: ?BGLNOV 3K V.NG +16 409
>Gregg_Speicher: EORU B4 EURO +12 233

#note Keeping the X for the 14F spot next turn. 
>Gregg_Speicher: AEEGNRS H1 ENGREAS.. +86 319
>Gregg_Speicher: AEEGNRS --  -86 233
#note I didn't see EN(G)AGERS, and neither did he. Now I get my X play. Yay. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ADLVX 14E AX +52 490
>Gregg_Speicher: AEEGNRS N1 EN.AGERS +74 307
#note Now he sees it. Good thing I got my X down.
