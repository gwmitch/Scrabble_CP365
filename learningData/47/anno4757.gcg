>Mike: DEEIJSV 8D JIVED +48 48
#note Rich had been having a rough day thus far, so when I opened with this, he gave a little sigh. It's nice to have that little psychological edge, but as you'll see, I couldn't do much with it.
>Rich: DGNRS E6 GR.NDS +16 16
>Mike: AEIIMPS 7G PIA +19 67
>Rich: AACELNT 6H LACTEAN +73 89
>Mike: EIILMST 11E .LIMIEST +70 137
#note Given the choice again, I might play MILTIEST, but not MISTITLE (that's just silly in either placement).
>Rich: AMNO 10J MOAN +26 115
>Mike: ADDHNTW L2 THAW.D +26 163
#note THAW 12L wins the sim handily; didn't consider it, with the too-open nature of the play (though the W isn't too dangerous) and the DDN leave. I'm a little puzzled as to why it's five points better.
>Rich: AIKN M1 KAIN +30 145
>Mike: DEGLNQV -GLQV +0 163
#note Too soon to panic exchange; GED N2 is best by a couple percent.
>Rich: FOT 12H OFT +22 167
>Mike: ADEINOT 1M .OA +21 184
#note IOTA (or IDEA) at N1 is best. If I'm going to play a closed board, then play a really closed board. As it is, this will cost me.
>Rich: ESZ 2J ZE..S +72 239
>Mike: BDEEINT L9 B..TED +18 202
#note Several better plays here, among them EMOTED or EMODIN at H10 (if you're going to play an open board, play a really open board!), or DEB at 10E. I just missed them.
>Rich: LORU 13E LOUR +10 249
>Mike: EEEINOU -EEIOU +0 202
#note Maybe ENDUE 14J to throw it open.
>Rich: EOV 14D VOE +14 263
>Mike: EEFGNPR M13 FER +25 227
>Rich: AY H11 ...AY +30 293
>Mike: EEGINPX 15M .EX +30 257
>Rich: Y 14L ..Y +24 317
>Mike: EEGINPU 10C GU.E +12 269
#note GUIDE, of course. I think I was pretty sure Rich had a blank at this point, but GUDE is still too scared.
>Rich: QSU N10 SUQ +23 340
#note So much for hoping Rich would try to stick an S on LACTEAN.
>Mike: EEINNOP 9G POI +24 293
#note NOTE K4 is the star here. I don't have a good way to open at this point, so I need to score and get close enough to be able to fish.
>Rich: I 12N .I +12 352
>Mike: EENNORT K4 NO.E +24 317
#note Continuing with the theme.
>Rich: GI 6C GI. +5 357
>Mike: BENORTW I14 WO +15 332
#note Best. I have to presume he has a blank here. My chances probably aren't teh 20% Quackle is giving this, though, as the duck will often mistakenly open for me.
>Rich: AL J10 ...AL +17 374
#note As Rich draws the last two tiles after this play, he gives a little laugh and an "Oh, wow." "Let me guess: blank-blank draw?" "Yep." Unbelievable; we were both presuming the other had them, and hence the board you see before me.
>Mike: BEHINRT M6 .HI +21 353
#note Long endgame coming, apparently; INANER 4J is best by a mile, for reasons to be revealed.
>Rich: ??CERRU F2 CURRs +17 391
#note Missing vERUCCa. I missed it too, so whatever.
>Mike: BENRT 3D BR.NET +10 363
#note I need to relearn how to play closed boards. Definitely didn't deserve this one, though it was probably winnable.
>Mike:  (E?) +2 365
