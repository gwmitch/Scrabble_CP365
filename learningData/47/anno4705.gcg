#note Ouch. Can I come back from a trip-trip AND a dub-dub?

#note Sure I can. But I whiffed on L8 VITREOUS for 9 more.

#note Or at 12A for same score, but that gives a potentially huge comeback.

#note Q prefers 5I AWA 26, which I considered. I liked the defense of this play better, even with 4 unseen A's.

#note I can only cite being brain-dead for thinking only of the A hook here. Yeah, that's the reason. Plenty of better options, of course. K4 FEST and N1 LIES for 18. I suck, but somehow manage to pull out an unlikely win. Great game, Scott!
