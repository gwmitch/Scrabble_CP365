#note This makes more sense than the other placement so as not to give up as many bingos.  However, the other way might have given me a spot for my bingo the next turn.

#note (my thought process, waiting for her play) BAM is clearly the best move here.  Scores well, manages the rack well, takes out the biggest hot spot.
#note (after her play) Hey, that gives me a cute I insertion.  Ooh, I've got a good play there.  Let's do that.
#note (after pressing clock) You know, self, BAM was better than that play.
#note I get distracted by shiny objects.
>CeLe: ?AEHINU D7 INHU.AnE +76 127
#note The whole rest of the game I was convinced this took an R hook, while she was ready to challenge it off.  Fortunately for me, she got almost all the remaining R's.

#note I really did think I could have played this at 15C, but I opted to keep it open, because she had shown that she "didn't know" the hook by playing BORON instead of BOOR 4A.  Sometimes I outsmart myself.  Or is it outdumb?

>Dave: HNOSTUU B2 SO.TH +47 383
#note Wow, kibitzer slightly prefers UNSHUT here, which does have the virtue of making bingos very unlikely for her, but it's such a huge point sacrifice.  Plays like this one basically say, "you've got one chance to bingo right now, and if you don't you lose."
>CeLe: ACELORV E13 O. +3 352
#note Monkey plays a slick fish.  If she draws a U, I will most likely have to block column M allowing her to win with ACERVULI H1.

>Dave: ADIU 12M .U +2 409
#note Apparently I need to review the fours as well.  This does not block the out of CERO.  I had a few minutes left, so no excuse.  However, CeLe was down to a few seconds, and my play succeeded in bluffing her into thinking there was no out.
