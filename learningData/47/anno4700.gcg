#note i don't understand how i chickened out on vetoers, but it's frustrating. i would have laid it down against many other people. amazingly, REVOTES sims highest. ?
>Marlon: EESZ 12A ZEES +52 95
>Cesar: ?ELNPSU M2 PLUNgE.S +75 243
#note passing up the bingo is correct by quite a lot - ZEPS keeping an ugly leave is better. shoulda done it. (-10)
>Marlon: AGQ 4L Q.AG +32 127
>Cesar: AAINNNR F10 N.NA +6 249
#note this is very wrong, i was frustrated i couldn't hit the Z , but i can if i just do 13A ANI and keep a substandard leave. at this point though, i thought things were going well enough that i could try to maximize spread too by going for a nice leave. that's not right. (-14)

#note well, crap. O12 MADE sims best, i can't let him have that spot, i have to force him to open the board again even if the leave isn't that great. (-3.5)

>Cesar: AEEINTU O14 .E +9 378
#note sims by far the best with many ply, but i knew marlon wasn't going to let me have whatever i hit. i have 4 shots at uintaite, maybe autunite, or unitage too.
