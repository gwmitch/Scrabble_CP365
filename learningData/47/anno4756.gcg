>Stu: ADGO M10 DAGO +23 59
>Mike: ENOOORS -OO +0 36
#note This, playing the Os (with TOO H8), or NONEGO 12I (a beautiful play) are within a point of each other. Take your pick.
>Stu: EIN K5 IN..E +12 71
>Mike: EIRSSTY 14M STY +19 55
#note Fishing just the Y with YO 13J is about 5 points better. Part of this is beacuse of the multiple lanes--including STYING, which I didn't notice.
>Stu: ER O13 R.E +18 89
>Mike: AEIIRSU -AIU +0 55
#note Oh for heaven's sake....
>Stu: ?EIMNRT 6C MINTERs +65 154
#note Apparently Stu missed the STYING hook as well. The best play here is really cool. (Answer next panel.)
>Mike: AEGIRST E4 RA.GIEST +86 141
#note INTERM(ODA)l last turn wouldn't have allowed this.
>Stu: CHP 8C CH.P +15 169
#note Apparently this was from a vowelless rack.
>Mike: ?EEFIRU 10C FU.IlEER +64 205
#note sUREFIRE 4A is a fair bit better.
>Stu: DLLRU G2 DULL.R +9 178
>Mike: AADFSTZ D3 ZA +26 231
#note FAD L3 is a few points better. At this point, though, I wanted to get in the way of the ORANGIEST hook, since I now had the lead.
>Stu: IIIOOO -IIIOOO +0 178
>Mike: AADFIST 3B FI. +30 261
#note ADZ is a tad bit better.
>Stu: AEU 5A EAU +7 185
>Mike: AADENST C8 .A.TAN +24 285
#note Fishing with GAR 7E is very close to this. I couldn't block the E effectively, so I opted to create a second good scoring spot.
>Stu: AWX D12 WAX +38 223
>Mike: DENOOSW A5 .NDOW +27 312
#note UNWOOED 3G wins the sim by a bit; I guess it's a matter of which lines you feel like taking out.
>Stu: BIL 2A LIB +24 247
>Mike: CEJOOSV N6 COVES +24 336
#note JOCOSE L1, of course. It's more than enough to outrun any bingo Stu might have. This is only about 1.5% behind, but why take the chance?
>Stu: Q 5J Q. +11 258
>Mike: BIJMOTU H1 JO +30 366
#note Finally locking this one up.
>Stu: EORSV L2 VERSO +30 288
>Mike: ABEIMTU 2J MA.IE +32 398
#note MIB J13, blocking the outplay, is six better.
