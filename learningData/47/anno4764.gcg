#note Trading did not seem to be called for, because the expected scores for both of us are so low that it makes sense to take out what scoring spots there are and grab a few points.  Nonetheless, I missed a few better ways to manage the rack.  The play I really like is ENORM 15A, which has the virtue of continuing to keep the board very tight.

#note It's this or OR in the same spot.  I figured the double O was at least as damaging as the double R, and turning over the extra tile was important.  Without an S or an A, neither of us has been able to do much.
>Salmonoid_-_N: U E10 .U. +6 179
#note We were both moving very fast, as we could tell this could turn into one of those 20 turn games.  As it turned out, we both finished with lots of time on the clock.
>Dave: ?GLORRR -GLORR +0 165

>Dave: ?HHIMNR 13H .H +9 174
#note Seems a little silly to block the likely bingo lane, but an A, E, or S draw will give me a bingo on column K.
#note Over the first 19 turns, we averaged 19 points per turn and played 43 tiles.

#note THROMBIN is a big improvement.

#note I didn't think she would buy GARIGUA*
>Salmonoid_-_N: ?AEORTV 1A TRAVElO. +95 372
#note Just in time, as I had drawn a bingo on row 2.

#note Lisa noted that even with the messy pool remaining I could have had FRECKLY, so she was careful to block it.

#note ACIDY is good.  EASY 2G is even better.
