#note Considered REFITTED. Wanted to clean up the rack a little better. Quackle approves.
>Rod_MacNeil: ?AAGJSU N1 JAGUArS +86 181
#note Cool!
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EELNOY O1 OY +47 140
#note POLYENE is the only playable bingo, but this is better.
>Rod_MacNeil: IIOOUU -IIOOUU +0 181
#note I felt like I was playing from behind this whole game, but I finally see a glimmer of hope when he scores zero here.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEELNO 6E OE +11 151
#note This was a weird move. I confused the hell out of Rod by picking up my O and my E and moving them to about 15 different places on the board. (Okay, fine, I exaggerate.) I decided on this spot because it seemed to make my bingo options next turn a little better -- it opens a second lane and gives me a DWS line to work with. I was hoping to bingo for 75 next turn rather than the 60 that I'd likely get from row 14.
>Rod_MacNeil: KNOW 12L WONK +45 226
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEILNO D3 OLEfINE +66 217
#note Okay, so it only scores 66. Not the end of the world...
>Rod_MacNeil: ARRZ 3A RAZ.R +28 254
>Evans_Clinchy: AIILRUV O12 .IVA +33 250
#note This really doesn't do that good a job cleaning up the rack, but it's easily the best play. The funny thing is that I considered trying something silly like RIVULAR* -- and if I had, Rod would have had a 185-point natural TURNKEYS through the K. I'm sure happy I blocked that.
>Rod_MacNeil: TUY A1 YU.T +24 278
>Evans_Clinchy: DILMRTU 4K DUR.M +22 272
#note MURID C9 is a clean miss, and I don't think I knew the word TRIDUUM. This is a pretty clear mistake.
>Rod_MacNeil: ABERV C9 BRAVE +33 311
>Evans_Clinchy: AADILTX 5A AXL.D +40 312
>Rod_MacNeil: EGINPST F10 P.IG +13 324
#note This is a tricky situation, because ENST is nice in theory but hard to get value out of on this board. I don't know what Rod should do here. (RAZOR)ING and fishing off the P at 2B are ways to score more points, but that doesn't necessarily make them better.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEINOT E10 O.A +11 323
#note I can't see anything better than this. I'm starting to feel like I have to bingo to win this game -- my tiles aren't scoring points at all, and he's going to outrun me if I let him. This is a nice fish, I guess...
>Rod_MacNeil: ACENNST M2 CA.N +28 352
#note Yeah, now I definitely think I have to bingo. That was the one scoring spot I had my eye on, and he took it for 28. Damn.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILNNT 11B N. +2 325
#note Now I have a 5/9 chance, basically. Two O's for ELATION/TOENAIL, two S's for SLAINTE etc., and an E for LINEATE. None of them are likely to be blocked. Basically I'm flipping a slightly weighted coin to decide whether I win this game.
>Rod_MacNeil: EINOSTT 3H TOTE +8 360
#note This blocks my most likely bingo spot. He's taking out ENTOILS, ATONIES and ANISOLE with this play -- if he's lucky, my rack is one of those. But as it turns out, I'm lucky, and it's not.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILNOT A7 TOENAIL +77 402
#note And thus, I bingo out. Crazy game.
>Evans_Clinchy:  (INSS) +8 410
