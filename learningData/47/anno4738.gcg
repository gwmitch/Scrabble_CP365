>Maureen_Delgado: AEGINRT 8F TEARING +70 70
#note Probably shouldn't put the E by a DLS. Oh well. 
>Matt_Canik: ADIJKNS K5 DJI.N +26 26
#note Saw JADIN(G) and (T)AJ but I decided this was best. Quackle actually likes JINK 7E and J(I)NK J7. 
>Maureen_Delgado: Q 7J Q. +22 92
>Matt_Canik: AEIKLRS F7 S.ARLIKE +66 92
#note starlike, stalkier, larkiest. I saw all 3 but this is most defensive. 
>Maureen_Delgado: FOW 11E F.OW +20 112
>Matt_Canik: AAEEHRW 5H HEA.WEAR +65 157
#note Saw this and laid it down right away. No REAL bingoes, but WHERE would have been good. Luckily, this wasn't challenged. 
>Maureen_Delgado: APTU O4 P.UTA +30 142
>Matt_Canik: AAEEITT H1 TEET. +27 184
#note Took points over leave here, but nothing left an especially good leave. 
>Maureen_Delgado: ?GGILNO 1H .OGGLINg +80 222
>Matt_Canik: AAIIOOZ H11 .AZOO +54 238
#note Wow, if I can score 54 with a rack like this, I must be getting lucky. Didn't see ZAI(K)AI but this is clearly better anyway. 
>Maureen_Delgado: HO 4L OH +25 247
>Matt_Canik: ?AFIILR N8 AIRLIFt +74 312
#note bIFILAR and FILaRIA are better, but I didn't know either. Also saw AIRFoIL. 
>Maureen_Delgado: X 6N X. +50 297
#note So at this point, I think she's averaging about 43ppt and I'm averaging 52. 
>Matt_Canik: ENNO O12 NEON +24 336
#note missed the rack. Oops. 
>Maureen_Delgado: DER 13C DRE. +18 315
>Matt_Canik: BCEEMMO 3C BECOM. +30 366
#note Tops. She blocked bemock, which probably would have simmed worse anyway. 
>Maureen_Delgado: NY F2 Y.N +14 329
>Matt_Canik: ADELMRU D3 .MERALD +22 388
#note I'm kinda close to bingoing here and wanted to fish with (C)UM, but decided that I should probably just try and empty the bag ASAP while holding onto a 50 point lead. 
>Maureen_Delgado: IOV 8A VIO. +21 350
>Matt_Canik: BCDSUUV 5A CUB.D +20 408
#note CUBS 3J was tempting, but I wanted to get rid of clunkier stuff- didn't want to lose it in the endgame. 
>Maureen_Delgado: AP 6B PA. +25 375
>Matt_Canik: EEISUUV K5 .....IS +30 438
>Matt_Canik: EEISUUV --  -30 408
#note Don't know why I thought this was good. This ALMOST cost me the game. All I can say about this is opps. 
>Maureen_Delgado: ISSTTY 10I STY +25 400
#note Not enough. 
>Matt_Canik: EEISUUV 10A EVES +26 434
