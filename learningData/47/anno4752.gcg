>Connie: BOR H7 ROB +10 10
>Dave: DEFLSTU 9F FU. +9 9
#note This may not be my best move, but I liked how little it left her to do.  It's nothing compared to my mammoth errors later, so let's move on.
>Connie: LV G8 L.V +8 18
>Dave: DELSSTV 11B VELDTS +27 36
>Connie: EERY B10 E.ERY +26 44
>Dave: EEEIIRS I3 EERIE +10 46
#note Missing the better spot for this word is truly horrendous.  I was justly punished for my error a couple turns later.
>Connie: ACGOR A6 CARGO +26 70
>Dave: ADIKSTU H1 KID +27 73
>Connie: ABFS A12 FABS +57 127
>Dave: ?ACISTU D5 CUrTAI.S +70 143
#note I spent a *long* time looking for the best bingo here.  I even wrote down SAUCIEST but completely forgot about its anagram.
>Connie: AILNPST J7 PLAINTS +66 193
>Dave: ?EGOTXZ 5D .OZ +28 171
#note Too greedy.  Better to dump the X first.  GOX J1 is the best way.
>Connie: AJOT K4 JATO +28 221
>Dave: ?AEGTTX 13J .EXT +22 193
#note I liked this over TEXT for the volatility.  If she hits one of the J or X, I can get the other.  Also, my chance of drawing an O is fairly good, so creating the hook might help me get bingos down.
>Connie: OPW L3 POW +39 260
>Dave: ?AAGNTY M2 YaTAGAN +94 287
#note I first laid down YATAGaN.  Then I switched the blank, and I *still* got it wrong.
>Connie: EIMR 12H MI.RE +40 300
>Dave: AEGNNOU N9 GUENON +30 317
#note Here's a rarity for this game: I actually made a good move.
>Connie: AIL 11I A.IL +26 326
>Dave: ADDHNRU N1 DAH +31 348
#note I'll stand by this instead of NUDZH mainly because I'm in much more danger of getting Q stuck after the latter.
>Connie: OW O1 OW +33 359
>Dave: DEHNQRU 2G Q. +11 359
>Connie: EEIIIMN O12 EN +19 378
#note She needed to block NOH O13, but I had *completely* forgotten about SEXTON.
>Dave: DEHNORU O8 NOH +26 385
#note The losing move.  I saw I would have outs of RUDE 13E or TRUED F11, but I forgot to actually count whether I would score enough points to win. For all the other mistakes in the game, this is the absolute worst.  REDON O6 is the cleanest way to win.
>Connie: EIIIM H12 .IME +24 402
#note My real mistake was thinking I had a won game and relaxing when I saw she had three I's on her final rack and heard her moaning and groaning about her misfortune.
>Dave: DERU 10I R.D +12 397
#note Despite all my other screwups, I still had a chance here to steal an undeserved win.  Playing just the D here gives her the opportunity to go wrong by making her high scoring play of KI, giving me seven extra points for RUE J1.
