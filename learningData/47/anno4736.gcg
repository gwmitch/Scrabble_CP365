>Mike: AENSSTT H8 .NSTATES +77 77
>Steven: HOPQ -  +0 24
#note "Hold..." Huh? After a couple of minutes, "Challenge." Double huh?? I mean, I know Steve hasn't played a tournament in a while, but that's...wow. I guess he convinced himself it was an adjective or something. But even so...wow.
>Mike: ?AAELOR 15A AcEROLA. +74 151
#note I looked for double-doubles, but couldn't find ALEATORy. This is next best, along with AuREOLAS.
>Steven: HOPQ 10D QOPH. +25 49
>Mike: GILNOST J2 TIGLONS +75 226
#note Another bingo I might not have found at the start of the year.
>Steven: AELORWW 5G WAL.OWER +78 127
>Mike: ADEEIPU D8 PI.UED +42 268
#note Keeping the D is a couple of points better.
>Steven: BENORR L2 BRO.NER +26 153
>Mike: AAAEEIU -AAEIU +0 268
#note Um, yeah. I kep the A because there were only two left, and I always seem to draw six consonants if I keep a bare E. That's probably better, though.
>Steven: BOY C7 YOB +26 179
>Mike: ?AENOXZ 4H ZA. +46 314
#note Pity OXAZiNE got blocked, but this is a decent consolation prize.
>Steven: GHIIRTT 12H .IRTIGHT +76 255
#note Another nice find from Steve, who's fighting like the dickens to get back in this thing. There's one slight problem, however...
>Mike: ?CEINOX O8 EXaC.ION +194 508
#note After the game, Steve jokingly asked why I didn't spend more time debating EXaCTION versus EXCITONs. The answer, of course, is that I didn't know EXCITONS. This held up for the high play prize.
>Steven: EFISV O1 FIVES +51 306
>Mike: ACIKUUY N8 YAK +49 557
#note May as well start gunning for high game.
>Steven: EGM 6F MEG +30 336
>Mike: CDEIOUU B8 COUDE +22 579
#note Or JEHU G8.
>Steven: EF A11 EF +21 357
>Mike: AAEILRU G8 .E.U +20 599
#note UTA at K11, not that it matters. This can't be 18 worse, can it?
>Steven: ADEITUV K10 DA.IVE +20 377
#note VIRTUE, same spot. Steve played pretty darn well from what I could see, but there wasn't much he could do about this. Good on him for recovering to finish fifth.
