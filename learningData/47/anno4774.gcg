#note Horrible. 1A KAINS 39 wins. My play leaves 2 outplays, but they're both easily blocked. In my defense, I was down to 1:00 on the clock. Not much of an excuse, but give big jim credit for finding the winning sequence...

#note Missing 15M GIG 17. Jim was down to his last few seconds, but pulls out the win on his way to an 8-0 day in the only game of the day he won by fewer than 100 points...
