>Chris: INTU H6 UNIT +8 8
>Andrew: AEEIRTV 10B EVIRATE +69 69
#note I felt like blasting the board wide open, setting up a glaring L-hook just for fun. The same word from I3 is much safer in a serious game.
>Chris: ?AENOPT A8 POlENTA +87 95
#note Chris commented that he might as well make his blank an L, but threatened me with physical damage if I drew a bingo starting with S. Less volatile would be EMPATRON or HAPTERON.
>Andrew: AEELSTU 15A SETUALE +101 170
#note A fabulous draw gives me this absurd comeback.
>Chris: AADEGIS H12 DAIS +45 140
#note I had unwittingly blocked Chris's AGATISED here.
>Andrew: AEILNST D5 LATIN.SE +68 238
#note I could hardly believe what I drew from the bag. I even showed them to Chris while he was on turn. Perhaps not very professional, but by now I was feeling light-hearted and light-headed. He spotted instantly that ELASTIN 11E would be best, but his play killed it anyway. My intent behind LATINISE was to set up the front hook, but Chris was wise to that as well, saying "Hoping to draw the other P?"
>Chris: ABDEG E2 BEGAD +25 165
#note Not sure what the rack was, but GELATINISED would have been fun.
>Andrew: EGMNORR C8 GO.ERN +32 270
>Chris: QT 13G Q.T +23 188
>Andrew: ALMOPRR 3C PR.MORAL +78 348
>Chris: CFK 6G F.CK +23 211
>Andrew: AHIIOYY H1 AI.Y +33 381
>Chris: ?DEELNO 1F LO.DENEd +59 270
#note The only other bingo being NIELLOED 8G.
>Andrew: EHIJNOY 2E .Y +31 412
#note My choice actually simulates best, but apart from the score I had in mind a draw of M for DEMIJOHN 12H. The way I was drawing, who would bet against it.
>Chris: HRU 9H .HRU +11 281
>Andrew: EHIJNOO 8K OHONE +38 450
#note Also creating a J hotspot 7M.
>Chris: UX 9M XU +36 317
>Andrew: BIIJMVW O5 WIV. +10 460
#note WIVE sims slightly better than JIVE (not quite sure why), but Quackle has a tiny preference for MIB 2L.
>Chris: DFI 2L DIF +18 335
#note I inferred from DIF that Chris did not have both O's (else FIDO might threaten an easy score, perhaps with ZO). Not sure what I was to do with this datum.
>Andrew: ABEIJMW 7K MEW +39 499
#note Better than MAW because it keeps the A for overlaps alongside WIVE.
>Chris: GISZ 4L ZIGS +42 377
>Andrew: ABIJO 5K JO +29 528
>Chris: COR E12 ORC. +9 386
#note C(LA)RO/OF is the tough find for 12 points.
>Chris:  (ABI) +10 396
