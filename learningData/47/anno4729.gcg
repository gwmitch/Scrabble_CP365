>Matt_Canik: ?EFOSSV 8H OF +10 10
#note I just couldn't talk myself into playing an S and I didn't know FOSSE. I still agree with this over VOES or FOSSE though. I don't like Fs for bingos.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEM 9H MAE +16 16
>Matt_Canik: ?DESSVV 10J DEV +18 28
#note I don't like blowing an S for 1 but quackle says DEVS. 
>Gregg_Speicher: BEI L10 .IBE +18 34
>Matt_Canik: ?ISSTVX M11 SIX +44 72
#note S(E)X might have been better, I should probably hold onto at least one vowel. 
>Gregg_Speicher: DEG 7F GED +12 46
#note Even though I'm stuck fishing/balancing and not especially scoring, it seems like he can't either. I'm not gonna complain. 
>Matt_Canik: ?HISTTV 11K H..T +24 96
#note Ranks first after sims, but I didn't know SHIST or HISTS. 
>Gregg_Speicher: EGNOP 8B PENGO +12 58
>Matt_Canik: ?CCISTV C5 VIC. +12 108
#note Oops, Co(N)VICTS. (E)VICTS was also good, had I seen it I would have played it... but I didn't look long here, I wanted to play a bingo and gave on bingoing with CCV too quickly. 
>Gregg_Speicher: ?IILORT 5C .ITRIOLs +70 128
#note Best bingo. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AACSTT 10B ATTACkS +73 181
#note Didn't know HISTS, and I think this is better than ATTACkS/VIBES. 
>Gregg_Speicher: ILOP H1 POLI. +24 152
>Matt_Canik: ANNOOWW 6B W.NO +19 200
#note NOW NOW. Best, considered NO(VICE) and OW 11D but those were both terrible. 
>Gregg_Speicher: MT G4 M.T. +10 162
>Matt_Canik: AAKNOQW I1 AWA +19 219
#note Didn't really see much that didn't open up big points for him... even though this leave is crap I think I can score with the KW next turn. 
>Gregg_Speicher: EGO 4J EGO +9 171
#note gone fishing. be back later. 
>Matt_Canik: AAKLNOQ F2 KNA. +23 242
#note This scores without throwing the board wide open like most of my options. After his fishes, I'm not overly excited about opening a lane for him...
>Gregg_Speicher: DRU 3C DUR. +10 181
>Matt_Canik: AILOQRR D2 Q.O.. +28 270
#note This or QI, and I took the points. 
>Gregg_Speicher: AU D10 .AU +6 187
#note Still fishing. 
>Matt_Canik: AILNRRR 12C R.RAL +5 275
#note Wanted to dump some Rs and block the lane. (G)R(A)IN was probably better. 
>Gregg_Speicher: LUZ N9 LU.Z +29 216
>Matt_Canik: HINNORS O8 NOH +25 300
#note Best, but RHINO looks pretty. 
>Gregg_Speicher: EENY O12 EYEN +40 256
#note Knew it was coming, but I didn't know HISTS so there wasn't much I could do. 
>Matt_Canik: BEINRSU 14F BURNIES +77 377
#note Yeah, sorry. GG. 
>Gregg_Speicher: ADEFIRT 15E FATE +33 289
