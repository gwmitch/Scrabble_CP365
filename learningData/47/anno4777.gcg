#note After starting out 4-2, I had just lost four games straight and was getting frustrated, which led to me rushing here.  I considered both FEZ and COZ in this spot and opted for the defensive value of this play.  Almost immediately afterwards, I realized I had missed the higher scoring spot for this word.

#note Kate laid down this word, thought for a while, took it back, thought for some more, then decided to play it anyway.  I challenged instantly.  On the way to the computer, I said, "if that's a word, I'm quitting Scrabble."

#note There was no need for this, but I thought I could sneak it by her.  She didn't say hold and wrote down the score while I went for the tile bag.  I already had the tiles in my hand and was about to draw them out of the bag when she said, "hold."

#note PRAHU is a better version of this play.  ATOP is pretty good too.

#note Hats off to Kate.  She played a good game when she wasn't phoneying.  Most of the time I don't mind losing this way, but it sure stung going from 4-2 to 4-7.
