>Jason: AAAEORR -AAAOR +0 0
#note I know Jeff has commented that he'd keep AER and Quackle likes it slightly, but I have a handful of reasons to prefer the ER keep. I won't quibble with keeping AER, but I prefer my play. (-1)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
#note I caught a glimpse of the "what do you say before a game?" discussion on CGP. I was struck by what Jeff said to me last year in Pontiac; I said "Let's have a good game" and he said "We always do." Since, Jeff usually says "As always," and we shake hands. I've taken to saying it against familiar opponents too.
>Jason: CEEKORU 8H CREEK +32 32
#note Duck prefers playing short here with UKE or KUE. Never occurred to me. (-1)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?CDDNOR K2 CORDoN.D +72 72
#note Look away, Rosin. :) Only playable.
>Jason: AEOPRTU 2K .OUP +16 48
#note Dammit! The ACEOPRTU alphagram looked familiar but I couldn't figure it out. OUT(C)APER. (-)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EFZ O1 FEZ +54 126
#note Rightly whacked for not just the bingo miss, but being overly ballsy.
>Jason: AABEORT 5D TEABOAR. +72 120
#note ARBO(R)ETA scores the same and sims better.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AIOP D3 PA.IO +14 140
>Jason: AAGJLSY 8A JAYS +54 174
#note Or JAY at C7. (-1)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IIIII -IIIII +0 140
>Jason: AAEGHLN 6F HA +30 204
#note The ANGLE leave is even better than normal considering that eight I's are unseen.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GV M1 V.G +14 154
>Jason: AEGIILN 4K .IG +17 221
#note Two I's, however, not exactly what I was looking for. Duck likes an I fish or (D)IE at 9K, the sim leader. Normally I would play RAGI, and that probably would've worked better. (-9)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEFLSTU B5 DEF.ULTS +66 220
>Jason: AEIILNO A11 AIOLI +23 244
#note This is why I hate fishing into ALIEN-esque leaves. Two vowels and now I've scored mediocrely for two turns in a row and putting myself at the mercy of the bag.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: HNO C2 NOH +25 245
>Jason: ADEEELN A1 LEADEN +32 276
#note Jeff seemed surprised. "Those are good tiles. (pause) Apparently you don't agree." The bag was very rich, though, and after this play Jeff didn't have a lot of places to score. Playing short seemed like a recipe for disaster. Sims best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ET E3 TE. +14 259
>Jason: AEEGLTU I8 .EGULATE +61 337
#note AEGLTU was not quite the draw I'd envisioned, but it worked. A little dicey, though, considering the bag and Jeff's fish.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEOSTUY H14 AY +32 291
#note Jeff e-mailed me after the tournament ... he goes over his racks with Zyzzyva and gave me his rack here and said he could've bingoed through the L. I saw it quickly, as I missed it once with AELOSTU through a Y, and have nailed it in study since. :)
>Jason: EIMNQRT 11H Q.IRT +28 365
#note I think I whiffed on the fact that there was only one E left. Q(U)INT, even with the -E hook danger, sims a little better. (-3)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IO 12G OI. +16 307
>Jason: EIMNNRW F10 WINNER +23 388
#note "I think that will make you the winner," Jeff said. Too focused on blocking, though; should've seen MINN(O)W at H1, the star play. (-27)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EIORSTU N4 STOURIE +66 373
#note Jeff assumed this wouldn't score enough, esp. with me having a counterplay. But I started to panic with all the high-pointers I had when Jeff had the blank and a near-unblockable 24-point out. Jeff also paused when he saw what I had. I said "ruh-roh" a couple times and may have even violated the NASPA code of conduct under my breath when I wasn't seeing a good play.
>Jason: IMNSVWX M11 SIX +35 423
#note Missed SIXM(O) at H1 and MI(N)X at 13D. But I had enough time to recount the game and be sure this won by two. Jeff saw (O)XIM at 7D, one better. (-22)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?BM E9 MoB +24 397
>Jeff_Fiszbein:  (MNVW) +24 421
