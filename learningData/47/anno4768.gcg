>Mike: AEHLOPT 8G POH +16 16
#note Missed bingo #2 for the tournament. TAPHOLE was in the first wave of words I added to my cardbox after the tournament.
>Joe: IQ 9F QI +17 17
>Mike: AAEELST F9 .AT +14 30
#note May as well draw to as good a leave as possible, since nothing scores; AE 7I is best by a couple.
>Joe: AGRU 7H GUAR +15 32
#note Joe went back and forth between GAUR and GUAR here.
>Mike: AEELSUZ 6J ZEAL +66 96
#note He chose...poorly. 
>Joe: INN K3 INN.. +10 42
>Mike: ?EEORSU N1 OvERUSE +82 178
#note Or OU(T)StEER.
>Joe: BCHIT E10 BITCH +32 74
>Mike: EEEFNOT L1 FETE +28 206
>Joe: MORRU O7 RUMOR +23 97
>Mike: DEEINOV 13C VI.ED +26 232
#note VOICED in this spot, or any of a number of plays at N10 (NEVOID, DOVEN, DEVEIN), are a few points better. Don't know why I didn't see VOICED.
>Joe: AGLRY 15A GLARY +46 143
>Mike: EIINOWY N10 YOWIE +53 285
>Joe: FOX M11 FOX +55 198
>Mike: ADINTTW D9 TAW +17 302
#note WITTED 3J is the star here; however, I wanted to start shutting down some lanes.
>Joe: CMOS 8A MOCS +35 233
>Mike: DEIKLNT 6C TINKLE +24 326
#note Second to KNITTED 3I; call it spot blindness. Again, though, I'm keeping with the defensive theme.
>Joe: ADEV E2 DAVE. +18 251
>Mike: DDEEETU 2B ETU.E +16 342
#note Right idea, but DUETED 2E does a better job of cleaning the rack up.
>Joe: ABP 1F BAP +25 276
>Mike: DDEGIOS 1L .O.D +24 366
#note I saw this as soon as I typed it in. Missed bingo #3. (Answer next panel.)
>Joe: ?AAILRS 15H AeRIALS +83 359
#note Missed DE(M)IGODS last time. When Joe played this, I wasn't too surprised; I figured he might try it out of desperation sooner or later. Still, I calculated the endgame out....
>Mike: DEGIJOS -  +0 366
#note ...and realized I had a win even if I lost the challenge. Which I subsequently proceeded to do. (YOWIE means the same as YOWE. Who knew?)
>Joe: INNN 3D N.N +10 369
#note NOW 12L, blocking JOWS and setting up the out-in-two, is best.
>Mike: DEGIJOS 1A JOES +44 410
>Joe: IN 9A IN +8 377
>Joe:  (DGI) +10 387
