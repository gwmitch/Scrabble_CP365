>Matt_Canik: EINOTWY E4 YOWI. +22 22
#note Yes, I didn't see (V)IEWY because I'm an idiot.
>Stephen_Sneed: ABIOT D2 BIOTA +31 69
>Matt_Canik: AENORTT H6 TO.ERANT +59 81
#note TO(L)ERANT is more defensive than TENTOR(I)A, and (B)ETATRON is less defensive and out of my range. I think this is best. 
>Stephen_Sneed: ANSV I5 VANS +29 98
>Matt_Canik: DMOPSUW J6 WO +30 111
#note Missed UP(B)OW (and I knew it, too)... but this ends up working for me. 
>Stephen_Sneed: EEEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 98
>Matt_Canik: ?DIMPSU 12C DUMPI.gS +74 185
#note Originially laid down MUDkIPS because it was hilarious, then played this. I didn't see DUMPSI(T)E, probably woulda balked on it anyway. This is good too. 
>Stephen_Sneed: AFZ 10F ZA.F +36 134
>Matt_Canik: ABEEINR 11B BINE +25 210
#note Given the spot to play BEANIER*, I probably would have because he wouldn't have challenged, but there was no spot. RANEE 11B is pretty, I didn't see it though. :(
>Stephen_Sneed: DE F5 DE +17 151
>Matt_Canik: ADEFRUU 2B FU. +16 226
#note Don't know FUBAR, this is 2nd. 
>Stephen_Sneed: GO 1A GO +14 165
>Matt_Canik: ADEERRU J11 U.E +3 229
#note I thought about this one for a LOOOOONG time. I didn't just want to throw a loane open after the fishing he'd been doing, but I wanted to dump the U and maybe an E or an R... I really don't know why I chose this aside from needing to make a play, as I'd spent a good 7 or 8 minutes here. I think my logic was along the lines of 'maybe i can get him to dump 5 letters by making a play at 14j' without realizing that I'm still giving a bingo lane. Whatever I was (or wasn't) thinking, this is what I played. 
>Stephen_Sneed: AER 11J .REA +8 173
#note fish more?

>Matt_Canik: ADEENRR L5 REEARN.D +70 299
#note Only bingo, glad he gave me the spot. Now I'm not worried if he bingoes back, I'll still have a lead. 
>Stephen_Sneed: ?CEIIST M1 dICIEST +75 248
#note Sure. Whatever works, I guess. I might be a little more aggeressive because I'm still down. 
>Matt_Canik: AGHOTUY 1K TO.AY +24 323
#note Saw THUYA but balked, didn't even know TODY was good for GOUTY/TODY, and though about this for about 5 minutes before deciding on TO(d)AY... I wanted to save the Y for one of the 3 unseen Ls for (TOLERANT)LY but decided not to. 
>Stephen_Sneed: EHNO C9 HO..EN +28 276
#note Now he's playing a little more agressively, but unfortunately for him....
>Matt_Canik: CEGHMSU 15A MUSH +50 373
#note Yeah. I quit writing racks after this, the game was essentially over. 
>Stephen_Sneed: AK C1 A.K +30 306
#note Nice job finding the spot. It's not enough, though.

>Matt_Canik: CDEGILN N10 CLING +33 406
#note NOW it's over. 

>Stephen_Sneed: ADQ 2J QAD. +39 345
>Matt_Canik: EEGIOPR 3H GRIP +24 430
#note It seems like overkill now, but this pays off later. By playing (TA)J I'm forcing him to play J(E)T 13B, giving me (J)E(U)/E(N) for a lot. This ends up reducing spread which really becomes an issue later in the tournament. Stephen dropped to 6-1, i moved up to 5-2, right on his heels.
