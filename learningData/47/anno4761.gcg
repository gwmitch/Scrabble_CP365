#note (R)OCkWEED for 101!
>moh: BFIKOSS C10 BO.K +24 278
#note This was one of my less inspired plays of the game. Ugh. FOSSI(C)K is pretty cool, but I won't beat myself up over it. FOBS 13D, however, wasn't hard to find.
>Dave: LNOOY E2 LOONY +21 297
>moh: FGIPSSU 14B PSI +23 301
#note FUGI(O) or FUGI(O)S at A3 are better. I liked having the key tile to powerfully underlap PSI at 15D, but I was probably too enamored with that. Dave very easily could have a strong play putting a D, S, or T there.

#note Looks like my setup lucked out after all.

#note I have no idea how I talked myself out of 15N XU. It's clearly better.
>Dave: ADIMORU 15K RADIO +31 402
#note This is a very interesting one-in-the-bag position. I can't really fault Dave's play of RADIO, although the computer says N6 OD(I)UM is best. I understand that Dave felt like he needed points, but with that ugly unseen pool, points are less critical than being able to go out next turn. If Dave draws the Q, keeping the I means he has an unblockable QI play at 15A. And if he doesn't draw the Q, he's going to have a much more flexible rack than me to work from after OD(I)UM. That said, RADIO's MU leave is pretty flexible itself. I imagine Dave thought it would win as long as he didn't draw the Q.
>moh: CMQSSUW 4D C.W +16 411
#note After convincing myself that Dave can't go out on his next turn and that I have no high-scoring places for the Q now, I starting to look for a setup, preferably an unblockable one. I was happy to see that 4D C(O)W 16 forced the win. I wish I'd kept looking, as the setup is even cooler at 11B.   
>Dave: MTU M13 M.. +12 414
#note There is simply nothing Dave do about the setup. He was very gracious about having his victory snatched away.
