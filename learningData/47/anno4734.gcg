>Dielle: ANUU F6 UNAU +16 16
>Mike: BIILOSU J2 BILIOUS +78 96
#note Happy to see this, the only bingo. This would start a trend for me this tournament; this is the first of several bingos that I'm not sure I had the anagramming skills or word knowledge to find six months ago.
>Dielle: ?INNQST 5H Qu.NTINS +82 98
>Mike: ?EINPTT 3G PET.TIoN +76 172
#note Gratified that there's nothing better than this.
>Dielle: GUV 2M GUV +20 118
>Mike: AABCDEF 1L FAB +20 192
#note FACADE 4B sims best, by about 3 over this. I'm not sure I understand why; with both blanks already gone, turnover isn't paramount, and at this lead, opening things doesn't seem wise. Thoughts?
>Dielle: EIKR O5 .KIER +27 145
>Mike: ACDEEPW N8 PEW +22 214
#note Or AWED.
>Dielle: AEGHIO M9 HOAGIE +43 188
>Mike: ACDEORS 12H CORDA.ES +82 296
#note Only bingo, and another one I'd probably have missed in March. Held briefly and released.
>Dielle: CHI H12 .HIC +33 221
>Mike: EFGMMNR I11 M.M +20 316
#note The top five plays (this, MM at N14, FEM at 14F, FROM at I12, and FRINGE 14F) are all within 1% win expectation of each other. I'm not sure I understand FRINGE (which leads); if I had it again, I'd probably play FROM.
>Dielle: OOZ 2F ZOO +38 259
>Mike: ADEFGNR 14J FAD.R +34 350
#note Totally spaced on putting the F at H1; FA is virtually tied with this. Again, at this lead I prefer to turn over a bit and shorten the game.
>Dielle: AEERTTT 4A TETRATE +71 330
#note Yes, I know. But look at my rack. Where, exactly, am I going with it if I challenge this off? At least I held, until I saw what I had coming back. (Scored as 72.)
>Mike: DEEGINS B3 D.SIGNEE +64 414
#note ENE(R)GIDS appears safer, to the tune of 1% win expectation (okay, I can believe that) and 10 points equity (say what?). However, there's a hidden factor here...
>Dielle: JO -  +0 330
#note ...and this is it; the blown challenge. Also, this is a third bingo this game that I didn't know before I started this latest batch of studying. (To be fair to Dielle, if she's not 100% on it, she's pretty much dead if it's good anyway.)
>Mike: AALLNXY A8 ANY +31 445
#note Got too fixated on A8 here. XYLAN E9 is the 100% play here. This is, like, 99.3%. 
>Dielle: JO 1H JO +57 387
>Mike: AEELLXY 5D EX +38 483
#note DEAL 3B, threatening EX next time? I like it. Good eye, Q.
>Dielle: AEILORR 3A I.EAL +31 418
#note Or maybe it's to prevent this. Best by Dielle.
>Mike: ADELLY 6M DA. +17 500
#note Thought I was being clever by blocking TORR, not seeing the other outplay. Sixteen back.
>Dielle: ORR D1 RO...R +7 425
#note (Final score recorded as 500-440.)
>Dielle:  (ELLY) +14 439
