#note Texchanges rise to the top of the sim (after inferring ERS on Evan's rack, which seems reasonable). Basically, I'm hoping to draw a bingo, watch Evan bingo with his rack, then bingo out for the win. I considered TINTS C3 (the best non-exchange), hoping he doesn't have one in the remaining lines, but I still don't like it. *Which* exchange is a moot point, but keeping IST wins the sim; not sure why.

#note Those who fornicate? :) The only thing I could see that was remotely plausible. This is a rather tough draw; change the second N to any of a number of other tiles (I and O, for starters), and I bingo out.
