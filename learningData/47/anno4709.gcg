#note Alpharetta, GA tourney round 19. I had already clinched 1st.
>Joey_Krafchick: AAIILNS 9G ANIL +16 16
#note Quackle is wrong. IAS isn't a bad leave, and it is using 4 tiles as opposed to 2 when I would be fishing and making AI. ANIL scores decently, I like the play.

>Joey_Krafchick: ACCINOT L3 COCA +21 210
#note this was my only terrible play. I didn't see ACTIN, didn't know OCICAT. I was also not considering that I should only use on C because they ARE good for bingoes. Not that I needed a bingo at that point, but they don't hurt.
>Chad_Harris: ?DNNORS M6 RONDoNS +66 218
#note I had my bingo to come back which would leave the board relatively closed with me having a 50-60 point lead. I liked RONDONS, but the real word is DONJONS.
>Joey_Krafchick: AGIINRT 14G AIRTING +65 275
#note I missed it up top former A(RIDER) :-( only 4 more points.

>Joey_Krafchick: HHLORUW I11 WHO.L +12 381
#note Quackle hates this play but I like it because it shuts down a bingo lane (very unlikely, but still gives him possibilities) and blocks the triple, which will limit him scoring and catching up.
>Chad_Harris: AA J11 AA +15 347

#note I don't know why I didn't use the U and play HOUR, but whatever.

#note I loved it, plus it looked good and I analyzed the situation seeing I couldn't lose if it gets challenged off.
