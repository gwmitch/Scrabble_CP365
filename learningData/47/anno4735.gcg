#note "Now now," I muttered under my breath. Yeah, big now on me. Don't ask me what I was thinking here. "Was I thinking" is a better question--the answer to which is clearly no.

#note Several okay options here. GOTTEN 4H sims best, since the pool is friendly enough that turnover is okay. I figured this line was tougher to block, and I also wanted to lengthen the game a bit.
>Noah: AHIMRT C4 THIRAM +26 410
>Mike: ?EGSTTV 8B T.. +5 345
#note I think I was fishing for an I for GrIVETS/VeSTIGE here. The standout play, though, is ViG 6B, which accomplishes the same things I'm trying to do here, only better.
>Noah: FT 6B F.T +14 424
>Mike: ?EGNSTV G7 V.. +11 356
#note Best in equity, but there are no wins here.
>Noah: AEFHIIL 4C .HIEF +22 446
#note LITHIA 4A or FIEF B3 are seven better. (Proof left to the reader.)
>Mike: ?EEGNST E1 EdG.EST +21 377
#note HENTEd 5C and bEHEST 5A (both very cool) are eight better. Despite being in lockstep with the duck for the first eight plays, I didn't deserve this one.
>Noah: AIL 6G AIL +11 457
#note ANIL H12, four better. Nicely done, Noah. Now now. :)
