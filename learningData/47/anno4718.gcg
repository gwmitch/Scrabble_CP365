>Matt_Canik: AEGGOQS 8F AGOG +12 12
#note Normally, I would changed 5, but the night before I had played some team games with Orry Swift who told me he NEVER exchanges. So I made like an Orry and went with AGOG. 
>Stephen_Sneed: ACDEEFO 7E IF +10 10
>Matt_Canik: ELNNNQS -LNNQ +0 12
#note Forget you, Orry.

>Stephen_Sneed: ACDDEEO D4 CAID +21 31
>Matt_Canik: ?EINSVX 9D VEX +26 38
#note Quackle agrees.
>Stephen_Sneed: DEELORR 7H DAD +13 44
>Matt_Canik: ?DINSUW K1 UnWINDS +76 114
#note I saw WINDUpS in the same spot and at 6I, but for some reason I felt REALLY threatened by leaving that I at 2K so I stuck the U in the triple lane instead. 
>Stephen_Sneed: EELNORR H7 ..OR +5 49
#note Whew.
>Matt_Canik: EELNPRZ 5C P.NZER +34 148
#note Missed PEEN 1I, which woulda been smartest after a fish like that, although I'm not particularly worried about a 3x3 through a U, especially when I know my opponent hasn't studied bingoes. Saw ZE(D) 6I but liked this instead. 
>Stephen_Sneed: AEILRST 2H TRE.AILS +68 117
#note Less points than saltier/doors, but he said he wanted to block the triples. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEELSU 1F EAU +15 163
#note Completely didn't notice that I was opening the 2B lane, but I like the leave enough to consider doing it anyway. besides, if I play somewhere else, then he plays where I did for 40 points. U(R)EAS/PANZERS is interesting, I didn't see it. 
>Stephen_Sneed: HOOOOUY 2B BRASH +49 166
#note Oops.

>Matt_Canik: AEEILNS 6J E. +10 173
#note didn't miss any bingos, saw (DOOR)NAILS for 33 but decided I should sacrifice the style points for the near-guaranteed bingo. 

>Stephen_Sneed: AEEEEOO -AEEEOO +0 166
#note He didn't have the blank here, I think. 
>Matt_Canik: AEIILNS O2 .ILESIAN +77 250
#note SILESIA is good, I figured this had a chance, but Stephen tends to be psyched out by my bingo skillz and probably wouldn't challenge regardless. He held, but didn't challenge. 
>Stephen_Sneed: EHOOOP N5 HOOPOE +32 198
#note I held this for about as long as he held SILESIAN, but it more of a courtesy hold... Stephen pulls random words out of nowhere. 
>Matt_Canik: BGILNTV 4J V.G +14 264
#note Just dumping some stuff while scoring enough to be ahead incase he bingos or something. Nothing else scores higher except B(I)NIT M1 anyway. 
>Stephen_Sneed: AEEIKTY M10 MICE +20 218
>Matt_Canik: BILNQRT M1 Q. +11 275
#note Just getting rid of it. Probably shoulda done 11L instead?
>Stephen_Sneed: AEKTUUY D9 .ATU +14 232
#note I think this is a fish, but with Stephen I can't really tell. I'm a little bit worried here and I'm guessing he has the blank...
>Matt_Canik: BEILNRT 11I BLIN. +14 289
#note I saw TERBI(C) but chickened out on it, BLIN(I) isn't great but neither is anything else to play. 
>Stephen_Sneed: ?AMW C12 MAW +20 252
#note This is the key play. He has the blank here for sure, he's trying to give himself more lanes. Now he has MAWN/MAWS, B7, and something through the E in mice. for him, there was about a 30% chance of me holding and N and he took the chance.
>Matt_Canik: EEENRTT 15A TENTER +30 319
#note OMG. For some reason, I didn't see NETTER. TENTER scared me because of the lanes it opened, but I figured he peobably wouldn't be bingoing becaue of YYUFJK left in the bag. TENTER scores enough for me to win if he bingos anyway, unless I draw something like YYU...
>Stephen_Sneed: ?FILORT 13G FLOaTI.R +65 317
#note He initially set down LOFTIeR/MICER (which I would have challenged) then realized he made his mistake and played this later. His highest scoring bingo. It all comes down to what was left in the bag. 
>Matt_Canik: EJKNOOT G3 JO. +18 337
#note I have to win this game by 4 for the championship...  I probably could have played a slightly better endgame, but I wanted the guaranteed out-in-two (though he COULD have blocked token, but wouldn't have scored anywhere NEAR enough). After seeing that he pulled YYUE, I knew I had it clinched and spread no longer mattered. 
>Stephen_Sneed: EUYY 3B YE +21 338
>Matt_Canik: EKNOT B9 TOKEN +18 355
#note GG, Stephen still gets 2nd... I feel kinda bad but after quackling I almost always made the correct play (barring silesian and tenter).
>Matt_Canik:  (UY) +10 365
