>Mike: EEHIOSS 8D HOISE +24 24
>Rafi: ADDIPSU 7C PUD +17 17
>Mike: AEILRST H8 .ARLIEST +77 101
>Rafi: ADDIIIS 10G I.ID +9 26
#note Or RADII, or ILIAD 11G. They're all pretty equal.
>Mike: CEEHRSU I2 EUCHRES +73 174
#note I don't want to play it at B1, obviously (too volatile), but it should go at K4. I couldn't remember if IRID took the S, though (it does).
>Rafi: ADEINOS 4F DIO.ESAN +74 100
>Mike: ?AEFJTX J1 AX +50 224
#note Quackle likes FANJET M2, setting up two big X spots next turn. In hindsight, I agree.
>Rafi: AEEMORU 3L MEOU +20 120
>Mike: ?AEFJTU O1 JE. +30 254
#note Quackle is suggesting FUJI G1. Quackle doesn't know what it's talking about. Why on earth would I leave a triple line open up triple figures?
>Rafi: ACELORT 13G R.LOCATE +74 194
#note Rafi said afterwards that he chose this over SECTORAL for the E hook. Interesting idea, and it may have some tactical/psychological merit; however, Quackle still prefers SECTORAL.
>Mike: ?AFIMTU N6 FUMIgAT. +70 324
>Rafi: ADFILNZ 12L ZI. +48 242
#note ADZ, 14M. I think Rafi was still focused on cashing the RELOCATEE hook at some point.
>Mike: AEEINOP O5 NAPE +39 363
#note Right idea, but APO is the play in this spot.
>Rafi: AADFLNO 14N DO +34 276
#note Or NODAL 6B, threatening the A hook.
>Mike: ?AEGINO 14A cOINAGE. +76 439
>Rafi: AAFLNRW 3B NARWAL +26 302
#note SWARF at K4, but at this point it hardly matters.
>Mike: BEKRTTY A12 BE.K +36 475
#note Finally reaching the point where all moves are 100% to win. (KYE 2M, for what it's worth.)
>Rafi: BFINNTV 13C BIN +22 324
>Mike: ELRTTVY D12 V..Y +28 503
#note TYE 2M is perhaps better; still keeps the vowel (there's no assurance I'll get another one), keeps the V for VIRID.
>Rafi: FGGNRTV 10F V.... +17 341
#note Q suggests FAG C2, but I'm not sure what that's hoping to hit.
>Mike: ELORTTW O14 .W +15 518
#note Not on CP's radar, but I don't want the Q.
>Rafi: FGGNRTY J12 G.Y +15 356
#note Quackle's suggesting GRAFT, which risks a Q stick and hence makes no sense.
>Mike: ELOORTT M7 TEL +19 537
#note RETOOL 2A appears best.
>Rafi: FGNQRT C1 TR.NQ +14 370
>Mike: OORT B9 TORO +10 547
#note Rafi just had nothing to work with here. Yes, I'm a luckbox.
>Mike:  (FG) +12 559
