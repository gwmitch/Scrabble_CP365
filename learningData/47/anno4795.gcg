#note Cute, but taking the points with AMIGA 4K is a fair bit better.

#note While on hold, Carl muttered to himself, "I kinda like MORDANTLY more." Afterwards he mentioned that ADLMNORTY had come up on a Jumbletime quiz a while back; he had tried DORMANTLY*, then eventually got MORDANTLY. To be able to recall that under pressure, especially when the play sounds so plausible (I was shocked it wasn't good)...wow. You wanna know how someone goes 18-2 in a field like this? That's how.

#note Right idea, wrong place. GERAH J11 wins the sim.

#note I'm not sure I agree with the sim winner, OPIUM L10; I hate shedding the last U with the Q unseen.

#note The surprising star play is NU M10, winning 3/8 endgames; this is apparently a no-hoper. In the postmortem, we found NAME 2L (wins 2/8), but I'm pretty sure anything fails as the tiles lay.

#note NE M10 is two better. One pivotal play changes the game; as John Hart put it after dinner, "That was a great play by you, and a better one by Carl." All you can do is tip your cap.
