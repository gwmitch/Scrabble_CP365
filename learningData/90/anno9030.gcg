#note Elmhurst, IL tourney, round 11 of 12. Doug had already wrapped up 1st place, and wound up 11-1. Awesome performance! Had I gone first, I had CIMEX/XENIC, but lost the draw. Sigh...
>trashman: CEIMNSX J4 MIXES +38 38
#note G7 MIX or 9E MINX slightly better. Tough call.

#note Q slightly prefers MOUE/MEOU, but there are 4 unseen N's.
>euro_biker_mcdog: ENZ N11 Z.NE +26 291
#note Doug took quite a while here. He hated the comeback possibilities, but felt he had to block the trip-trip.

#note I never considered not exchanging, as I'm probably toast without a bingo. I thought about keeping AT, but there's 2 of each remaining, so I trade all 7. Q's top plays are 3M TAU, and D1 FUCK. Yeah, that sums it up...

#note Doug's in extreme time trouble, with about :10 left, and slaps this down quickly. I'm down to about 2 minutes, and see he has only 1 spot for his U. I waste too much time making sure he has no other spots, and block with FA, thinking I can maximize scoring and possibly win, not realizing I'm gonna get C stuck. The optimal sequence is CAP followed by G8 IF for 18, which loses by 2. Kudos again, Doug!
