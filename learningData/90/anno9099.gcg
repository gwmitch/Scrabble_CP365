#note I liked setting up my M but it's not going to help me too much. Quackle suggests MY 9G or YOM 9H.

#note Phony. If I'd thought for longer I would have realized it wasn't good. Shouldn't have gotten myself into this situation with JIAO, and I was lucky that she didn't challenge.

>Sam: EENNOPR E4 PONE +15 168
#note I'm okay with PONE since I wanted to open things up a little. ONE 14F sims less than a point better, and that play leaves Marlene with much less to work with.
