#note i rarely exchange 7 but it was almost immediate this time. i guess i didn't think hard enough, but GUV is worth it probably. (-10)

#note 14D PLED is probably a little better, i shouldn't be breaking up the rack and giving him a scoring spot, but i'm not nuts about GINT either on this board. (-2)

#note yuck, i spent a long time on this move, but there doesn't seem to be anything better than VOX. quackle likes L8 VISIT though. ehhhh...

#note crap, TRANQ cesarrrrrrr... i was mostly just trying to decide between NARRATE and QAT. in the absence of any strategic thought on my part, NARRATE sims best. i didn't think about it much, but in situations like this, turnover may actually be a valid theory.  (-1)

>cesar: AEELNRR 2J .EANER +26 312
#note LEANER seemed to me not the easiest thing to overlap, but i am wrong. i did think about stuff like JApE and how much that would suck. do i fish, or do i try to keep scoring? it seemed right to start closing lanes and try to stay ahead. 4L ERE sims best though.
>lester: AAGS 1L SAGA +38 292
#note well that wasn't too hard to overlap
>cesar: CCIKLRU 5J .RUCK +22 334
#note i think something like CURB or CUB is the best move here.  the problem is scoring so damn little. quackle will prefer the equity play.

#note well, now i'm screwed
>cesar: CEIILUY 8A LI.I +15 349
#note LIRI makes me a bit less likely to win than CEILI, apparently, which is 50%. I have to hope he has the J. (although REJOIcE, RESOJEt, it seems tough. maybe EIJORS? will work for me, but definitely not with LIRI. i should have played CEILI. mainly, i didn't see the E-ending bingo in EEIORS? and wanted to block OSIEREd... but then my play makes no sense because if he has EEIORS? i lose anyway through the L.. so i don't know wtf i'm doing.
