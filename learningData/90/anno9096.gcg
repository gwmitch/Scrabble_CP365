#note this sims second best, eventhug the leave is kind of junky. the pool is vowel heavy though, which helps. PECKS is preferred by about a point.

#note i wish he had played something that took an S so I could clean this up with DUSKY 52. of course i still have PUCKS, but I decided to make one of my dumbest plays ever. I thought, why not just set up my S? wait.. is PUCKA good.. uhhh.. no that's not good. ok i'm safe.

>scott_jackson: DIILSTU L7 ID +12 425
#note i wanted to block the X spot at L8. i can't play LIDS/JADED yet because i only have one spot for TUI. however if i play TUI first i win since he has to block LIDS/JADED. the only other winning play is SULCI 8A. i don't think i even looked up there. anyway i decided to something pretty dumb instead. again.

#note fortunately will was not on his game here either. E13 XU, N5 LUXE and N4 AXILE are the winners.
>scott_jackson: ILSTU 15A LUST +28 453
#note still can win with SULCI but i don't see it. right after i played i realized i gave him a huge play to win.
>will_anderson: AELUX N5 AXLE +29 460
#note fortunately for me, will misses it, and also gives me enough points to go out with my I.
