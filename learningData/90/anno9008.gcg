#note This is the equity-robot play, but I had to think hard about how risky it was floating a D out there. It's worth noting that Mack just played the last two E's, making it tougher to bingo to a D without one -- but then again, both blanks are unseen. HAD is an aggressive play that banks on beating Mack to the bingo, which might backfire horribly. Safer options include SURA N12 and QUAD L12. I'm really not sure what the best play is.

#note After the killer FIVES, I'm feeling a little more bingo-desperate. I figured I would leave line I open, leave line O open, keep as good a leave as possible, and pray. The sim results are all over the place -- this is in the mix, but a couple other options are VAUS H1 (kills one line and opens a new one, which is interesting) and RAVEN 14D (better score, but keeping that U makes me nervous with another one unseen). I'm OK with my play here, but I'm open to suggestions.
