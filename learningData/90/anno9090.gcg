#note he's very good at blocking bingos apparently. M2 UNHANG and 14L HUNG preferred by a few percentage points.

#note Very happy to find this, though there are a few other winning plays. it's actually second best to G2 TOYON leaving BPR (??!!). apparently the sequence after that leaves me with a slightly larger margin of victory, but no way in hell would i see that in a game.
