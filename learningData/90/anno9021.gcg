>Jackson: DEIIKNO 8G OINKED +26 26
#note I didn't see or know KOINE. I chose OINKED over the words I did see (OINK KINO IKON) becase of turnover and points.
>Tara: JO 7G JO +36 36
#note Tara didn't write down her racks this game.
>Jackson: ADEIIII -IIIA +0 26
#note I wasn't sure if I should keep ED, ADE, or DEI. In retrospect, keeping ED was probably best. I thought that, with such a vowel-heavy rack, that the consonant-vowel ratio in the bag would bring me more consonants. No A's had been played, so it was likely unwise to keep the A. Quackle valuates ED as 2.7, ADE as 1.4, and DEI as 0.4
>Tara: AW 9F AW +26 62
>Jackson: ADEELLY 10B DALLY +34 60
#note Missed LEADENLY, I3. I wasn't a huge fan of my EE leave after DALLY, but I couldn't resist the points. With two open D's after DALLY, the EE combination isn't quite so bad.
>Tara: AE 11E AE +14 76
>Jackson: CDEEGLO C9 C.GED +24 84
#note I considered DECLOG* 8L, but correctly assumed it to be a phoney. CADGE, in the same place as CAGED, would've been an obvious pick (had I thought of it). I also missed DECALOG.

>Jackson: EEFHNSS K5 F.N.SSE +44 145
#note I considered making a more conservative play keeping an S or two, but I was unwilling to sacrifice the high-scoring and elegant play of FINESSE.
>Tara: ABM B12 BAM +23 140
>Jackson: EGHINQR I5 Q. +11 156
#note I strongly considered playing HI I5, to set up a bingo ending in G, and ran my clock for 6:00 thinking about it. EGINRT only combines with the letters in the phrase, "YOU MANLIEST", 66/100 tiles. Definitely not a guaranteed bingo. Hinges scores more points, and turns over four more tiles. My opponent's last few moves have been short ones, leading me to believe she is close to a bingo. Opening a new lane, putting yourself only 10 points in the lead on a relatively closed board is a bit too risky. Hinges scores decently and keeps the bingo prone RT combination. Congratulations on reading this hefty note. :)

>Jackson: EGHINRT L1 HINGE. +33 189
#note I briefly considered opening a new bingo line for myself, saving EGINRT. I turned the option down because of a) no bingo lines could easily be created using the H, b) I would be sacrificing too many points by playing off the H, and c) EGINRT only combines with "YOU MANLIEST", comprising 66/100 tiles. a 2/3 chance of playing a bingo is not high enough to justify a fish.

>Tara: EPR 2K R.PE. +26 228
>Jackson: BHIIITX 15C I.HIBIT +36 335
#note I was searching the board for an E (exhibit), which led to the 39 pointer that saved my rack. I was quite pleased with inhibit, for the same reasons as VOYAGE. 36 points and a leave of X was more than acceptable.

#note I briefly considered VOX M11, but couldn't resist 43 points. 
>Tara: AZ M11 Z.A +24 279
>Jackson: AEFLOTV 15L FAV. +14 392
#note At this point in the game, since the board was quite closed and un-bingo-friendly, I just wanted to wring every last point out of the rack. Had I known FAVELLA (playable at E5), my final score would've been boosted by at least 30 points. I thought of NETT 3M, but turned it down at the thought of being stuck with the V.

#note I completely forgot about NETT. Enough said.
