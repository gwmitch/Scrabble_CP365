#note missing the double double 'cause i suck. i liked this better than things vertically in J or horizontally in 10 to keep the board more closed. even so, cineast is probably better than this in terms of what it gives back.

#note quackle wants ABA H1 or 12F. I wanted to get rid of an E because there are many and score points. I guess it's too dangerous to make all those new lanes.
