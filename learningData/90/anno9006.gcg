>Evans_Clinchy: ?IORRUW 10F WR. +17 17
#note Wow, ORU? is a ton better than IORU?. WIRY sims a little ahead of WRY.
>Brian_Galebach: ABEU E8 BEAU +22 38
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ILOPRU I2 PURLOIn +61 78
#note Saw ROUPILY but chickened out; missed CROUPILY completely. This was the only bingo I was confident on.
>Brian_Galebach: FITZ 4H F.ITZ +42 80
>Evans_Clinchy: ABFOOOY 5K OAF +27 105
#note FOOTBOY is a word, apparently.
>Brian_Galebach: ADKOU 2I .ADOUK +30 110
>Evans_Clinchy: BDLOOSY 6F BLO.DY +28 133
#note So, apparently, is SLOBBY.
>Brian_Galebach: IMN 3M NIM +20 130
>Evans_Clinchy: EEENOST M5 .EE +7 140
#note Ugh, overfishing. MENTEE is far better.

>Evans_Clinchy: EEHILPT K9 HEP +31 288
#note Yuck. Missed the better spot at I11, which scores 5 more and also keeps bingo options more open for next turn.
>Brian_Galebach: DEV L10 DEV +23 307
>Evans_Clinchy: EEILORT C12 ..O +14 302
#note Pretty sure it's wrong to fish here, putting all my eggs in the "line N bingo" basket. A play like TELE at I11 is a good way to outrun Brian without a bingo. I've seen (CONSENT)E(D) at this point, but not really given serious thought to how juicy that spot is. Running low on time.
>Brian_Galebach: ?HJ 1J HaJ +44 351
#note If Brian sacrifices 11 points to play this in the bingo line instead, I'm in real trouble. Interesting decision on his end.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEILRT N8 ATELIER +70 372
#note Lucky.
>Brian_Galebach: ETW O13 TEW +22 373
#note He has the same word at I11 for 16 points more, but this one Q-sticks me!
>Evans_Clinchy: AEILQRS 14F LA. +5 377
#note Setting up a new Q spot.
>Brian_Galebach: GGNNU N2 ..N +9 382
#note Brian realizes I can play the Q, runs low on time looking for a way to block, and then gives up and plays this. Seconds after hitting his clock, he starts chastising himself for making a bad play. At the time, I have no idea why.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIQRS 8M S.. +10 387
#note Figuring the Q is still unblockable and I have the game easily won, I start my out-in-three -- first this, then RE I11, then obviously QI. I wish I'd known what Brian was mad at himself about...
>Brian_Galebach: GGNU 15G G.U +7 389
#note Oh, I see. He found this.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIQR 9D R. +2 389
#note Now I'm low extremely low on time too, and I scramble to find a new Q setup. My first thought is REI M13 -- but I thought that was blockable because I thought GERE was a word! It's the badpods! What the hell? Where did I get GERE# from? Richard Gere# I guess? Anyway I play this instead. It leads to a tie.
>Brian_Galebach: GN 13M G.. +8 397
#note Well, it would lead to a tie. Except... you'll see.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIQ C8 QI +16 405
>Brian_Galebach: N 14A ...N +5 402
#note Brian has 0:00 on his clock, and he throws this down saying "six and out." I almost didn't have the heart to tell him it was only five. (Key word being "almost.")
