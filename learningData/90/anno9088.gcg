>Joel_Wapnick: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: AEHRSSW I6 WASHERS +80 80
#note Luckbox!  I5 SWASHER  also scores 80 and wins the sim by 1 point.  Whatever.
>Joel_Wapnick: DJOY 10F JOY.D +36 58
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHLOT 11E HOE +23 103
#note The standout  play is 11G HEREAT 31.  This is a 4-point dog - gives up a few too many scoreboard points though this does work out.
>Joel_Wapnick: BIIOR 12A ORIBI +21 79
>Jim_Burlant: AEEKLRT A11 T.KER +27 130
#note C9 ALKIE wins the sim by a hair, presumably due to the strength of the ERT leave.  J2 KELTER is also a very strong choice. I considered another one of Q's preferred choices, 13E ELK, but felt it gave up a few too many scoreboard points.  
>Joel_Wapnick: ANUU H12 UNAU +18 97
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNOX B12 .AX +44 174
#note While there are other high scoring options available (C9 XENIAL, C9 XENIA) the leaves are too iffy and they give too much back.  This is clearly best.
>Joel_Wapnick: ILPY 9I .IPLY +20 117
>Jim_Burlant: AELMNOR J1 ALMONER +72 246
>Joel_Wapnick: BEGIO L7 OB.IGE +24 141
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGLNTU M1 GAUNTLy +65 311
#note Gave up on finding the row 1 bingo too soon once I couldn't find the 3x3.  ANGULATE 1E is definitely best.    Having said that, this is actually a pretty strong defensive choice..  While it concedes 9 scoreboard points, it does a nice job mucking up row 1, and with the right draw I can seal off the entire top half of the board in one turn, where ANGULATE would have opened up all sorts of lanes that might have been more problematic to defend.
>Joel_Wapnick: AELR 13L EARL +18 159
#note I don't know his rack, but Joel told me after the game he did have  a no-go this turn.
>Jim_Burlant: CDNOTTW O12 C.OT +27 338
#note Or CLOD.
>Joel_Wapnick: SV C11 V.S +26 185
>Jim_Burlant: DEGNSTW 1H GN.W +24 362
#note Best.
>Joel_Wapnick: AM 1M .AM +18 203
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEFST K4 FEE +27 389
#note Now it's all about strangling the board.  One of 5 choices that crosses the line from 99.99 to 100% winnning chances.  This has the highest valuation.
>Joel_Wapnick: DEI H1 .IED +8 211
>Jim_Burlant: ACDESTT 2L C.T +14 403
#note Q agrees that a 2L play was the right call here.  Probably should have played TAD to eliminate any possibility of an ME?????? bingo.
>Joel_Wapnick: FIN G3 FIN +22 233
>Jim_Burlant: AADESTU F4 DAUT +14 417
>Joel_Wapnick: IP 7D PI. +5 238
>Jim_Burlant: ADEESVZ C3 DAZES +39 456
#note Q predictably says  I should play at 8A for 50.  Pfffft.  Why on earth should I give him a line for an out bingo when I can score 39, kill all his remaining lines and set myself up to go out in 1?
>Joel_Wapnick: ?ENOORT D3 ORa +21 259
#note And Joel misses an out bingo of MEsOTRON O1.
>Jim_Burlant: EIV E1 VIE +10 466
>Jim_Burlant:  (ENOT) +8 474
#note Joel went roughly 30 seconds over on time.  Final score: 474 - 249.
