>Jason_Ubeika: ?AEFILT 8D FiLIATE +76 76
#note Best bingos for Jason are FETIALS or FATLIKE, but it's style preference - this barely sims 2 points down.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AADEUY K5 YAUD +27 27
#note The highest scoring play which just happens to also unload the rack killing UY combination.  Clearly best, nothing else worth consideration.
>Jason_Ubeika: CRRY 6J C.RRY +24 100
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEITT M6 .EATTAIn +68 95
#note 9B ApATITE scores 70 and is best.  Other interesting choices:  M3 AmARETTI, M3 pATRIATE, M1 HATTERIA.
>Jason_Ubeika: AEEGLTU I8 .UTELAGE +61 161
#note Very nice find by Jason, and he's winning 72%.
>Jim_Burlant: DFIIJRS 15H J.RID +45 140
#note Best, nothing else worth considering.
>Jason_Ubeika: DZ 8M .DZ +39 200
>Jim_Burlant: BEFIIIS 7C FIB +20 160
#note Suspected I missed a bunch of better plays on this turn.  Best is D6 BIFFIES, which I didn't see.  L2 FIBER is also better.  BIFFIES Wins 21%, and this play wins 20, but it's weak.   Play incorrectly scored as 21.
>Jason_Ubeika: ASV L4 VA.S +22 222
>Jim_Burlant: EIISSWX L12 XI +37 197
#note A sign that I was rattled by this game's progression - that I actually gave any serious consideration to playing (I)WIS G8 as an X setup.  Maybe against Quackle, but certainly not against a human.  Needless to say, this is best, and nothing is is even worth considering.
>Jason_Ubeika: DNO 6D DON +17 239
>Jim_Burlant: EEILSSW N1 WISEL. +24 221
#note Sigh - the 7 doesn't play, and no F, N, R, or V for an 8.  Given that the board could easily be shut down if Jason hit the right overlapping play, I felt it imperative to open up the top half.  There are no standout plays and the sim results indicate that anything is as good as anything else.  This choice, which sims in 6th place, sims within 1 point of the sim winner, 14M SEW.  My winning chances, which have crept up to roughly 30%, are about to take a dive.
>Jason_Ubeika: AEINOPS 10C SAPONI.E +64 303
#note The only playable bingo for Jason, and suffice it to say I'm now in serious trouble - he's winning 88% and my next rack probably will take my chances down into single digits.
>Jim_Burlant: EIKNSUW C10 .WINK +24 245
#note Now I start trading equity to keep the top half of the board alive.  Best play is apparently M2 KUE, which I didn't look hard enough to find.   The thintg about this positoin is that  anything I can put down either keeps tiles I need to unload (i.e., KUE still saddles me with the W) and/or it kills lines I need to remain open.  I hate this play as it still saddles me with the U as well as kills rows 12 - 14, but really - I need a bingo quick and I need to unload my counters.  Also - I'm hoping that if he plays on row 1, whatever he puts down will leave me a hook I can take advantage of.    
>Jason_Ubeika: BNOR 1K BRO.N +33 336
>Jim_Burlant: EEORSTU 14B U.E +14 259
#note Best play here wins roughly 5%; that's 11C WEE.  I know there are 4 E's in the ppol but I don't want to unload both of them.  I'm still trying for the miracle bingo and am hoping he doesn't have the hook tiles to take this line out.  Given how this game was going, I should have known better.
>Jason_Ubeika: CEOP A12 COPE +43 379
>Jim_Burlant: EMOORST 2J MO +14 273
#note Laughing out loud.  The best play here is totally sick:  EMOTERS 11E scores 54, and even that wins less than 1%.  AT this point it's just equity and trying to salvage a spread-closing bingo.
>Jason_Ubeika: EGT 3I GET +15 394
>Jim_Burlant: EGHORST 4H HOG +20 293
#note No idea what to do.  Considered G4 HOG, which the sim likes, but he was so sure to block it I felt it pointless.  Not that this helped much, either.
>Jason_Ubeika: EEQU F2 QUEE. +34 428
#note You know, maybe HOG G4 wouldn't have been so bad after all...
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHRST 11C .HA +31 324
>Jason_Ubeika: LMNOORV 4C MOV. +18 446
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST O8 .EATIN +16 340
#note I literally laughed out loud when I saw this as my final rack.  Tells you everything you need to know about this game that I'm trailing by 122 pionts, have AEINRST and no bingos play.  Sheesh.  Best sequence here is CRISTAE followed by ZIN.  I didn't see it until too late. Not that this matter.
