>Jim_Burlant: ?DDKNRY -DDKY +0 0
#note   I didn't like DRY, as I didn't like the slightly consonant heavy DKN? leave, so why this?  I can look at a list of 4's from now until Doomsday, and 3 days later I still won't be able to remember if RYND or RYNE* is the phony, so I opted for safety.   This is a compromise borne of uncertain word knowledge and is not the right play; RYND 8D is the right move.  Regardless, it did lead to a rather unusual sequence.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EIMOV H4 MOVIE +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: ?BNORTW 5F BR.WNOuT +74 74
#note No 2x2's available, so this or BOWFRONT are best.  This placement is best - the 5C placement gives back way too much if Brad has an S.  Of note:  7F TWINBORN.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AQT G7 QAT +46 72
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEEEO -AEEO +0 74
#note Style preference as to what to do here.  Best play is apparently 6H (V)EE 17 per the sim.  Maybe with better word knowledge I'd do that, but AAEO? could get ugly quickly if I have the wrong draw.  This sims roughly 1-1/2 points down.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EGY 6D GEY +30 102
>Jim_Burlant: ?AELNUU F8 NEUrULA +65 139
#note Best play (which I didn't know) is UN(G)ULAtE D4.  This is second best, but an 6-point dog in the sim for good reason:  not only the three scoreboard points conceded to UNGULATE, but all the easy back hooks (E, R, S) in the unseen pool.  This play is a huge defensive liability.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: BEILNU 15A NUBILE +34 136
>Jim_Burlant: AGGINTY 13B GANG.Y +30 169
#note Please answer a question:  how do I find BROWNOuT in 1/2 second, yet miss GYRATING barely three turns later?  This is awful!
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ACEFHO 11E A.CHFOE +56 192
#note Beautiful play by Brad, and blocking my intended THIRTIES bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: EHIISTT L8 HEIST +39 208
#note Hmmm...Interesting sim result.  I was feeling the pressure to stay in the game so I opted to take the points.  Q's preference (by a hair) is to just play for the bingo with 12K HIT for 17.  
>Brad_Whitmarsh: FIINW D1 WIFIN. +34 226
>Jim_Burlant: ADIKRTX M7 TAX +41 249
#note Q prefers 8k KHADI by not quite 3 pts; this is runner up.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AOP C1 APO +29 255
>Jim_Burlant: DDIKNRS 8L ..RK +33 282
#note Q still loves 8K KHADI and says everything else is a distant second....but I'm not sure I agree.  While the pool has AAEEEEEEIII still unseen, I don't want to leave myself without any vowels.  Also - normally I'd unload the N and keep the R, but there are still 4 R's unseen and N's are gone, so I'd want to unload the R and hope to get another one.  The other play I considered was 1A DRAW.  While I'd normally want to balance the rack and unload the dupes, duplicated D's aren't the worst thing to keep (e.g.:  riddle, etc.), and I don't think it's worth conceding 9 points on the scoreboard to unload one of them.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AJLU J10 J.UAL +30 285
>Jim_Burlant: DDINRSS 1A DR..S +27 309
#note Or DRAWN.  The one drawback to this choice is that my human opponent is certainly going to infer that I have another S.   That said, I'd rather balance the rack.  And it certainly worked well.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AEMZ 12A MAZE +54 339
>Jim_Burlant: DEINORS 15H ROSINED +90 399
>Brad_Whitmarsh: OOR M2 ROO. +8 347
#note This is an extremely smart play by Brad.  Prior to this, the board was way too easy for me to defend - the only bingo lines available were either airballs in the J column and any extensions from the D.  Obviously my focus would have been to take out the D column, now I've got several lines to deal with and he's put the onus on me to make the right play.
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEIOT J3 CO.ED +10 409
#note Q prefers that I either try to fish for a bingo with 6H VOE or go for score with N1 CEDI.  CEDI is an interesting choice, but it still leaves the J column open.  I spent lots of time on this move, trying to come up with a way to block row 2 and the J column at once.  Brad told me post-mortem that he liked this play, as it killed everything he was setting up and left one in the bag.  And, since he didn't have anything in the A column, he was stuck having to try playing through the K.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: T 3C ..T +6 353
>Jim_Burlant: EIIILTV A1 .EV +7 416
#note Have to block SPEARED.   Best play per Championship Player is B3 LIVE, which does that a little better than this.

>Jim_Burlant: IIILT O6 TI.I +8 424
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ADEEPRS A8 SPER. +27 380
#note Best play for Brad is DEEPS N1.
