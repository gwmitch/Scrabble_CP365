#note I played this to take away bingos on the I column since CONE seemed somewhat fishy and he took a while to play it. Dropping the S at 11G, though, sims much better. It scores more and is a better bingo fish, plus I can probably score more points if I don't have a bingo.

#note I got a little infatuated with the M spot I was setting up at L8. AMIA 15G is simming better by almost four points, as it scores seven more points and the J has scoring prospects.

#note UH is so clearly a better play. I block one of the two bingo lanes, and next turn I can either take out the other one or I keep VANE in reserve. VANE sims just a point worse but I definitely should have played UH.
