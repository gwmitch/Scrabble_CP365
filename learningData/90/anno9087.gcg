#note Luckbox!  Q likes this best.  If he had exchanged more of his rack (e.g.:  5, 6, or 7) I might have been inclined to pass up the extra points and played for safer vowel placement.  However, given that he exchanged 2 he's probably sitting on one-point tiles and this is ok.
>Chris_Lipe: AEILNOR F3 ORIEN.AL +62 62
#note Surprising choice - 7E AILERON scores 71.
>Jim_Burlant: AELSSWW 11B WAWLS +31 105
#note Surprised this choice didn't make it into the initial kibbitzer options, but not surprisingly it fares very well.  Q prefers WAWS 11C by not quite 2 points, with this as the silver medalist.  Q must think ELS is worth 4 more points than ES.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEKNST 4H DANKEST +85 190
#note Best bingo.  Other placements (J8, 9I, 7I) give up way too many points on the scoreboard.
>Chris_Lipe: ?ACEIRY N2 lI.ERACY +78 160
#note Beautiful find by Chris - definitely the best play.
>Jim_Burlant: EFILLOT 8L FI.O +39 229
#note Or FOCI.    With no L's in the unseen pool, duplicated L's aren't the worst thing to keep; any of the other options that unload an L leave O8 open and give up too many points to this or FOCI.
>Chris_Lipe: DUU K4 .UDU +18 178
>Jim_Burlant: EGLLMOT 12A MOLE +35 264
#note Best.  LOGE unloads the G, but as clunky as the G is, it's not worth giving up 5 points for LMT as opposed to GLT.  Of note:  C7 M(I)LL(A)GE.

#note If you're my opponent and you don't know my rack, this looks like I've made a pretty strong play.  And there's a lot to be said for playing for 37 and drawing 2 to GILNR with AAAEEEEEE? unseen.  However, I realized after I hit my clock that I had whiffed, and that TAXING should have been the play, and not just for the extra scoreboard points.  It puts Chris down a bingo and simultaneously kills the most lucrative of his remaining lines.  Quackle says this is only a 1-point dog.  While this is by no means a terrible play, I do think this is a bigger mistake than the sim says.  I just got lucky that he didn't have the right rack to punish me.

#note Best, nothing else worth considering.

#note The only playable bingo, and it wins 98%.
>Chris_Lipe: EHIOSTU 14F TOU.HIES +72 331
#note The only bingo for Chris, but Q says his winning chances are still barely 1 in 20.
>Jim_Burlant: CDDEEEZ A12 .EZE +45 429
#note Sim prefers this for the extra scoreboard points - I'm wondering if, in retrospect, I should have played FEEZE L8 to muck up rows 11 and 12 with the blank still unseen.
>Chris_Lipe: ENO 14A .ONE +26 357
>Jim_Burlant: CDDFGIO 15L FOCI +50 479
#note  Now that we're approaching the end game, sims are 4-ply.  This or FICO is best.  DDG sucks as a leave but, well...50 points is 50 points, you know?
>Chris_Lipe: EJNTY 12H J.TNEY +48 405
