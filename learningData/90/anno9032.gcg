>Jackson: AELOOSV 8H OVA +12 12
#note Quackle recommends LAEVO 8D, a word I did not know. OVA sets up for OVAL and leaves a decent leave.
>Tara: CLX J7 C.LX +29 29
>Jackson: ?DELOSZ 9E DOZE +26 38
#note DOnZELS, SOzZLED, and SnO(O)ZLED. I thought of SNOOZLED, but thought it to be a phony. DOZE is the best non-bingo.
>Tara: AH 10F HA +37 66
>Jackson: ?ALLRSY E9 .ALLY +24 62
#note I am an idiot. I saw RALLYES on my rack, but saw no place to put it. ADOZE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Quackle says DALLY is the best play that doesn't involve ADOZE.
>Tara: DEW 12C WE.D +16 82
>Jackson: ?FORRSU C7 FURRO.S +36 98
#note No place for FURROWS the bingo, so why not play FURROWS the non-bingo? Quackle puts it at the top.
>Tara: MO I10 OM +13 95
>Jackson: ?EEHIOT K10 OH +20 118
#note EH D7 would've been better...

OH closes a bingo lane...

EH scores more points...

EH opens a new bingo lane...

blegh...

>Tara: ADEGS H11 EGADS +31 126
>Jackson: ?EEIKNT -  +0 118
#note I incorrectly challenged. I wasn't too worried about Tara blocking good bingo spots as KERNITE is playable for 85 at D7 and for 83 at A15.

I didn't know EGAD took an S.
>Tara: CEIM 14F ME.IC +22 148
>Jackson: ?EEIKNT D1 KErNITE +85 203
#note I missed NETLIKE B1. 

But I won't complain about 85 points :).
>Tara: AET 1A TEA. +24 172
>Jackson: ?BDITUW 13G W.B +31 234
#note Quackle agrees with me...
>Tara: FI 2B FI. +24 196
>Jackson: ?DEITUU 6D .UTU +6 240
#note I am internally killing myself. I sat there for 2 minutes thinking of bingos through the N in KERNITE. I was thinking of words beginning with UN, and didn't see UNUNITED or UNSUITED.

AARGH!
AARRGH!
AARRGHH!
>Tara: IINORUY 15D YOU +14 210
#note YOU is playable at 12J for 4 more points.
>Jackson: ?DEEEIS 4D .EEDIESt +59 299
#note I considered REEDIEST 3E for 1 more point but opted against it as it makes the H1 triple word score more dangerous.
>Tara: NOPR 12J PORN +18 228
>Jackson: EIILRTV F2 VI. +14 313
#note With 4 unseen N's and 4 unseen A's I am quite likely to draw the great 6 tile combinations AEILRT or EILNRT (a 1/3 chance exactly) . With the board somewhat open, I considered VIE to be a reasonably decent play. 
>Tara: IN M11 I.N +6 234
>Jackson: AEGILRT 11B G. +3 316
#note I missed GRA(YOU)T(S). I feel like such an inadequate player...

Tara's last play of INN neither opens nor closes the board, but leads me to believe she doesn't have the last s. if she did, she would probably want to leave the PORN -> PORNS hook wide open. 

My obvious fish of GO ranks surprisingly high (3rd) according to Quackle. AEILRT combines with all letters but A FIG VOW (JQXZ). Go creates another bingo line and almost guarantees a bingo the following turn. ZAG G11 would've been a great play.
>Tara: ABEINRT 5C B. +4 238
>Jackson: AEILPRT A6 PLAITER +84 400
#note My luck continues...
>Tara: AEIJNRT H7 J.. +10 248
>Jackson: AANOQRT N7 QANAT +18 418
#note I knew I couldn't fully prevent her bingo, but after QANAT her chances are lowered. As it turns out, we were playing with 99 tiles. The G had mysteriously disappeared... I know by "SCRABBLE rules" I should've played off 2 (or in this case, 1) tiles, but why not just take some points?
>Tara: AEINRST O1 ANESTRI +85 333
#note After the game was over, Tara realised she could've done RATINES, QI, AN, NE, and AS for 10 extra points. 
>Tara: INOR (GINOR) +12 345
#note the correct score is 418 - 341, as the G was missing.
