>Michael_Kapernaros: ILNOORY 8H ROILY +24 24
#note Round 15, Old Greenwich, July 2011. I am 8-6, Judy is 9-5, loser will almost certainly be locked out of the money. Quackle likes this, LOONY, IRONY or NOILY. I debate IR vs ON as a leave and incorrectly choose ON in retrospect. Didn't see IRONY.
>Judy_Horn: KNY J8 .NKY +21 21
>Michael_Kapernaros: ADEHNOO 7G OOH +22 46
#note Didn't know HINKY for 7J HAO. Quackle sims them pretty even anyway. Only other play of note is 7G HONDA, which quackle sims worse but scores far better.
>Judy_Horn: DELRU L3 RUDEL. +20 41
#note I make a note here of the front hook on RUDEL(Y). It may come in handy later.
>Michael_Kapernaros: ACDENOR 6A ACORNED +71 117
#note Challenged. Other bingos here: 11G CRA(Y)ONED, 11C DEACONR(Y), 3G RANCO(R)ED. Looked through the R, for some reason just ignored the K and Y (probably because I deemed them too ugly.)
>Judy_Horn: EINOV -  +0 41
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEPSTT A5 T.PE +18 135
#note There are bingos here too, including D5 P(R)ETASTE, 9B SEPTATE and B3 SPE(C)TATE. Oooops.  Instead, I go fishing...
>Judy_Horn: EINNOTV 4A ENVOI +26 67
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEOSTT K11 ETA +16 151
#note And I get punished for missing my bingo opportunity here... B2 TE(N)A(C)E sims marginally better. 
>Judy_Horn: GMU B8 MUG +14 81
>Michael_Kapernaros: AEEOSTT L11 TOE +18 169
#note ...and here. Best.
>Judy_Horn: AEEGIM D6 .EIMAGE +22 103
>Michael_Kapernaros: AAEISTU -AIU +0 169
#note ...and here. Quackle wants me to play AUK for seven points, but I like exchanging better. And with fifteen vowels unseen in 45 non-blank tiles, I like holding ATES... again.
>Judy_Horn: DFIN 13A FIND +28 131
>Michael_Kapernaros: AAEOQST A13 .OE +18 187
#note Drawing back QOA. I get what I deserve...and then I absolutely should dump the Q at M9, but instead... (Quackle thinks its only 2% worse - 79% to 77% to do this. I think Quackle's insane.)
>Judy_Horn: SX B12 S.X +38 169
>Michael_Kapernaros: ?AAQRST 3E QAT +24 211
#note And I forget the spot at M9 exists...
>Judy_Horn: ?EILSTV 14E VITtLES +67 236
#note Thankfully, it doesn't matter, because she's not using that spot anyway.
>Michael_Kapernaros: ?ADENRS 2I DANcERS +78 289
#note Oh look, there's the hook on RUDELY. Best, though DARN(D)ESt also plays at 5H... at this point, I note that before these bingos, there were 29 in the bag. That means there's a 50/50 shot the Z is coming out here, and there are two massive Z spots on the board. Which means whoever draws it is a huge favorite to win. Do you like coin flips...?
>Judy_Horn: AHOZ H11 AZO.H +78 314
#note She spends a few minutes on this play, so I figure at the very least she doesnt have ZA on F2, so even though i haven't drawn the Z,  I figure I can start closing stuff down. After the game, she told me she was too busy looking at H12 to look for other Z spots, though if nothing had fit, I'm sure she'd have seen it. 
>Michael_Kapernaros: IIIJPSW B2 JI. +20 309
#note As soon as I draw this, I start lamenting about my run of five straight losses yesterday afternoon and I deserve my awful luck in this game and so on and so forth. I have to stop doing that late in crucial games - while my clock wasn't much of an issue here - I had about 9 minutes - it's just not productive thought.

This rack is so bad that even Quackle thinks we should dump four of them back in and start over again. It then prefers 2F PI (I disagree: it hardly shuts down the triple, too much goes before IT- and the S-hook it's creating on PA is useless if she hits the triple and IT. Next is 6I WIS(E), also ugly because it abandons our last S, and 12F WI(Z) which scores 5 less but keeps the J. All of these plays are ugly. I decide that JIN is fine without a D in the bag.
>Judy_Horn: AFIW 1G WAIF +38 352
>Michael_Kapernaros: AIIRSUW 5J WA.I +16 325
#note Quackle still likes WI(Z) better here. I'm just trying to give myself lanes.
>Judy_Horn: BCLPRTU 4K P.B +15 367
#note She told me that this was her rack after the game. What a brutal rack, especially with ING unseen. Quackle hates the idea of blocking off both the N and O lines with SCUP (for example) but.. up 36 should be plenty of a lead, as I can only really (theoretically) score with a B (F2 for 26?). She doesn't know this, but the bag holds AE- meaning the 1/72 chance that I can't do that has actually come true here. Quackle likes 3J BU(R), BU(R)L or BU(R)R best, or F4 C(E)P and pray that I don't bingo, I guess... 

Maybe play one and try to score on the response play after the bingo if it comes? The problem is that if I have a bingo starting in S, there's a chance it can come down off O2 so the only real play is O1 US and that means we have to pray for one of the four vowels left over just to have a 6:1 ratio.

This is brutal.
>Michael_Kapernaros: BGINRSU N5 SUBRING +73 398
#note .. and I cost myself (meaningless) spread points because I'm too busy anxiously hoping SUBRING is good and not realizing O2 (S)UBRINGS exists. Challenge, good, game. I guess there IS a real world application to Abstract Algebra...
>Michael_Kapernaros:  (ACELRTU) +18 416
