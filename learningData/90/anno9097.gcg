#note I'm pretty happy with my play up until this point. I think this play was a mistake, though. Quackle clearly prefers playing through with EVER 6I. That's not a super strong play, but I can probably keep scoring points and stay in the game.

#note This play didn't work out, but it felt like the right thing to do. I think I needed to keep scoring here.

#note I liked trading six here to try and go for the blank, but I still wanted to keep the R since there weren't any more in the pool.

#note I didn't notice WIN or WINNER at 12F. I did consider WINNER 10I which just hopes to draw the blank. Looks like I should have gone with one of the underlapping plays.

>Sam: EILLMNT 14A .LEMI +25 284
#note Not quite sure about this play. Quackle seems to think MILLET 12I has the best chance of winning. That looks okay to me, as it reaches a little deeper into the bag to find the blank.

#note Poor endgame: I was low on time, as I was way too frequently in this tournament. VAT L11 is nine points better.
