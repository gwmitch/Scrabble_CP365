>Jim_Burlant: AAIOOOX -AIOOO +0 0
#note Sim gives marginal preference to this choice.   Exchange 7 and exchange AIOOOX also sim quite highly.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EIKT 8G TIKE +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: AFJNSTX 7F FAX +26 26
#note How did I not see this at 9H?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: HO 6F OH +20 36
>Jim_Burlant: CJNOQST K5 JOTS +31 57
#note Quackle prefers J6 JOE and exchange JQ.  Normally I'd love to keep the S but don't think I'm going to get very far keeping 5 consonants.  I'd rather turn 4 and score 31, even if I have to sacrifice the S to do it.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: UY 6J Y.U +14 50
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEFNQ 9C FENCE +23 80
#note E4 DEF wins followed by E5 EF, exchange Q, exchange EFQ, and this choice.   I didn't like this a whole lot, but again - i don't see how I'm going to get anywhere playing short.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: INT E4 TIN +12 62
>Jim_Burlant: DIQRRTU 4A QUIR. +48 128
#note Duplicated R's blinded me to anything that didn't unload one of them, specifically, 8A QUID, which is best.   This is second best, but justifiably at a heavy equity loss due to points given up and slotting 4A with the Q.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IPSU A4 .UIPS +48 110
>Jim_Burlant: ADEHORT 3C HO +22 150
#note Sim prefers 8C placement by 3 points; I'd rather keep the D and E columns alive for bingos if he takes out the M column.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABG 2A BAG +19 129
>Jim_Burlant: ADEOORT E9 .OO +6 156
#note Again, Quackle likes the idea of taking out bingo lines through the E and N of FENCE. I don't.  All I felt I could do was dump off the offending O's and hope to draw into something good.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?ADEERT M3 DEAREsT +75 204
#note hEARTED and rETREAD are Siri's best bingos here.  Play incorrectly scored as 76.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENRT 12C TENDER +20 176
#note By this point I've had enough of the fishing.  1A AT wins; Since the fishing wasn't going well, I figured that I should turn some tiles and try to land the remaining blank, especially since he just drew a fresh 7.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AAGIM L9 AMIGA +18 222
>Jim_Burlant: AACENNS L3 AN +11 187
#note Felt another line couldn't hurt - what good will AN 1A do if I draw into a bingo that doesn't hook AMIGA?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABEZ H11 B.AZE +48 270
>Jim_Burlant: ACDELNS 15B CLEANS.D +62 249
#note Or at 15F; both sim interchangeably, at 20% winning chances.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IM 10J MI. +13 283
>Jim_Burlant: ENOUWWY M13 YOW +28 277
#note Sim gives slight preference to N2 YOWE and N2 WOW.  I don't want to part with my E if I have to, and N2 WOW looks psychotic.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IO 11H .IO +9 292
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNRUW N11 GREW +32 309
#note I've brought myself up to 34% with this choice, which sims 3rd to N10 GLUER (really?).  But it's a smokescreen, as Siri's next rack clinches the game for him.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?DEILRS 2F SoLDIER +64 356
>Jim_Burlant: LLNPRTU J1 P.LL +6 315
#note All I saw was Siri dumping the V's with VIVE and I didn't look as hard as I should have to actually identify his bet play.  Safe to say that, by this point I had disengaged from the game.  Obvoiusly, POLL G1 to prevent ALIVE would have been much better than this.
