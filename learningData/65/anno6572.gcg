>Jim_Burlant: DGILLOT E7 G.LIOT +14 14
#note Quackle doesn't like this much, preferring I5 GILD.  I don' think LOT is that good as leaves go; I'd rather turn more of this rack, which I probably should have done with GALLIOT.
>Emely_Weissman: BDEQRSW -BDEQRS +0 18

>Emely_Weissman: EHNV C9 H.VEN +30 48
>Jim_Burlant: EIILMOV H4 MOVI. +13 61
#note I didn't like any of the choices here.  Even though this wasn't one of the original quackle choices, it holds up quite well, simming in a virtual dead heat with 9G OLIVE for sim winner honors.
>Emely_Weissman: EFZ B12 FEZ +37 85
>Jim_Burlant: EILMNTY 4H .YELIN +22 83
#note Not knowing MYLONITE (I thought there might be something in this rack), this was a critical mistake.  For some reason I decided I didn't like EILNT as a leave, I couldn't think of MITY, so I opted for turnover with this play, which I didn't like.  Punishment was swift.
>Emely_Weissman: ?AEENSU K2 UN.EASEd +64 149
#note N2 plays (AvENUES, AENEOUs, etc.) score 78.
>Jim_Burlant: DEFMSTX 2J F.MED +38 121
#note Best.  I thought the 50 points for EX J1 would have been fools' gold due to both the board position and the horrid  DFMST leave.  I'd much rather turn 4 than 2 with this rack, and Quackle agrees.  I'm at 31%.
>Emely_Weissman: AINU 1L UNAI +25 174
>Jim_Burlant: BDSSTUX I8 STUB +15 136
#note I forgo 8J plays because I want to hit it with the X.  I'm at 24% with this choice; 8J DEBUTS wins at 33.
>Emely_Weissman: ACOP 1G CAPO +29 203
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNSX 8K .XINE +60 196
#note Don't know why I couldn't think of EXILE.  But this mistake probably helped me, and you'll see why when you see my next rack.  I'm back at 38%.
>Emely_Weissman: IJNTY O4 JITN.Y +24 227
>Jim_Burlant: DKLLRRS M6 KR.LL +11 207
#note Best.  Where are the vowels?
>Emely_Weissman: AAW H11 AWA +14 241
>Jim_Burlant: DHRRSTW 13F WR.TH +13 220
#note Quackle doesn't like my play, probably because of what came next.  H11 AWARD wins, but I don't agree - what am I going to do with HRSTW (even with all the vowels in this pool) on the next turn?
>Emely_Weissman: EIR 13F .....IER +28 269
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEORS -  +0 220
#note Lost challenge.
>Emely_Weissman: IO N5 OI +15 284
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEORS 6F DO.E +12 232
#note Feeble, but I'm trying to get soemthing open up top, even if it takes a couple of turns to create a lane for an 8.  I don't see how ODE 12K is going to help me win this game.  If I play something like AWARE H11, she's more likely to make a cheap play to kill that end of the board and I'd be dead anyway.
>Emely_Weissman: OOP 12K POO +20 304
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADERRS 14M AR +7 239
#note This game is really looking like it's over and I'm just grasping at straws.   I'm Just trying to open row 15, and I'm crossing my fingers she doesn't have the E that would allow her to play ET, ER, or ES at 15N to kill the line.   
>Emely_Weissman: AEIORST 15H RATIOS +25 329
>Emely_Weissman: AEIORST --  -25 304
#note This is Emely's actual rack.  When she put this down, I had to do everything I could to not tip off that she was gift-wrapping me the game.
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCDERS 15G SCRiBED +91 330
#note Now I can't lose this game.  Utterly amazing - just a second ago I'd have sworn I was absolutely dead in the water.
