>Evans_Clinchy: ACDQRUU 8F QUAD +28 28
#note The only question is placement. This seemed safest.
>Seth_Lipkin: HMPY G7 H.MPY +22 22
>Evans_Clinchy: ACNNRRU 11C RUNN. +16 44
#note This seemed worth the slight point sacrifice vs. CARNY or CURRY.
>Seth_Lipkin: ANV 10B VAN +18 40
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ACENPR J2 PRANCEs +86 130
#note This is the best bingo, but OMG PARCENARY!
>Seth_Lipkin: EIRW C9 W..IER +26 66
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEEGIT 14B G.EED +22 152
#note Talk about bad defense. Obviously this opens up line 15, but I completely blanked on the fact that also, GREED takes a front A! GENIE E9 is much less vulnerable in this position.
>Seth_Lipkin: IOTT 15E TOIT +17 83
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIOTTZ 5H ZO.E +26 178
#note I find it kinda shocking that EROTIZE 3I is the runaway sim leader. I've never been a fan of opening triple-triple lanes with an E next to a DLS square. I spent a while on this turn looking for a way to score with the Z without opening any crazy counterplays, and I couldn't really find anything. I really thought this was my best option, but the sim is strongly against it.
>Seth_Lipkin: ABG A13 BAG +26 109
>Evans_Clinchy: DEFINTT L1 FETID +41 219
#note I had to feel pretty good at this point, taking a 110-point lead and closing off a lane. But now it starts to unravel...
>Seth_Lipkin: ?DINOSU E2 bOUDINS +79 188
#note Uh oh.
>Evans_Clinchy: CEILLNT 1L .LIC +27 246
#note Or FILL/FELL, but it made sense to take more points here.
>Seth_Lipkin: EOW 3I W.O.E +24 212
>Evans_Clinchy: ELLNOTT 12B L.T +12 258
#note This is probably a mistake -- this isn't a very friendly board for bingoing with ELNOT, and I could make a less fishy play by adding the E for four extra points, or going with LENTO F1. I probably would have played LENTO had I seen it.
>Seth_Lipkin: IMX D4 MIX +44 256
>Evans_Clinchy: EELNOOT H5 .OE.E +23 281
#note Needed a strong vowel dump to keep pace with him. Good thing this was available.
>Seth_Lipkin: AAKR C2 ARAK +29 285
>Evans_Clinchy: AHLNOST B1 THO +24 305
#note This and just HO lead the sim. I figured THO was better since the T would block his access to the triple a little bit.
>Seth_Lipkin: AEFOR A2 AFORE +21 306
>Evans_Clinchy: AGJLNSU 13E JUGAL +30 335
#note This endgame probably plays out very differently if I just play JUG. But I don't mind opening the board a little -- I'm digging into a fairly decent-looking bag holding a fairly decent NS. I'm feeling pretty confident at this point that I can outscore him the rest of the way.
>Seth_Lipkin: ABEIIRY 12H YERBA +39 345
>Evans_Clinchy: ILNOSSV O1 .OVIN +11 346
#note Seth has two outplays with EIIST -- FETIDITIES L1 and CITIES O1. Neither of us (nor any of the observers post-morteming our game later) saw the former, so I spent a long time figuring out the best way to block the latter. Even without FETIDITIES, this endgame still isn't winnable for me if Seth plays it right. I played COVIN to keep SELLS at 11I, but this isn't winning me the game unless the recount has a surprise for us. The better strategy for me is probably CLONS, which keeps two spots to go out with VIES (M9 and F1). There's a chance that Seth messes up under time pressure and l can steal the win. That doesn't happen, though.
>Seth_Lipkin: EIIST F1 TIES +17 362
#note This is second-best behind FETIDITIES. Heh.
>Evans_Clinchy: LSS I11 S..LS +10 356
>Evans_Clinchy:  (I) +2 358
#note Crazy, crazy game.
