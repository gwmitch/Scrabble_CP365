#note I guess I was thinking of BUGLER.  Larry asked me after the game if FUGLER* was good.  I told him I liked it, and when he discovered that it was phoney he accused me of cheating.  I hope it was in jest.  Most of what he says is in jest, if not everything.
>Larry: EELNRST E4 ETERN.LS +82 143
#note It makes more sense to allow it with this comeback, but he could have challenged it off and played RELENTS/BREAKS, blocking the spot for RICOTTA.  That would have been bad.

#note Best is to play 13F NAE!  Obviously, I had to block MAYINGS, but I could have also blocked GRIMY while threatening an out-play.
