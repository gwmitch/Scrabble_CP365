>Joey: AEEJOOU 8G JOE +20 20
#note Exchanging might be better here.  At least this opening bingo streak against me is about to end.
>Evans: AEGMOTU 9G OM +19 19
#note Sim suggests JUG, which does have the benefit of setting up my A. But against the short opening, I opted to play it safe and keep the board tight early on.
>Joey: ADEIORU -OU +0 20
>Evans: AAEGTUW -AUW +0 19
#note Perhaps I'm overreacting here to Joey's trading two. But a short exchange here led me to believe that any play opening a high-scoring bingo lane was stupid. I'm not saying I'm confident my exchange is right, but it sure does look funny to make a 20-point play that makes his bingos score more, especially if it keeps a crappy leave. Even if I try inferring strong five-tile leaves, the sim still disagrees. WAG 7I? WAGE 10D? No thanks...
>Joey: ?ADEIRR J2 RAIDERs +71 91
>Evans: AEGLOOT 10B GALOOT +23 42
#note This was chuckle-worthy. That's twice in two weeks that GALOOT as a six has come up in a game between me and Joey.
>Joey: AIOQTUU 6F QUOT. +34 125
#note QUITE is slightly better. I guess AOU is a little less disaster prone than AIU.
>Evans: ?ACEIST 11F pACIEST +78 120
#note This is the max score, but perhaps DACITES would be better to keep the vowel away from the TLS.
>Joey: ADIIILU H11 .ILIA +24 149
>Evans: EIIRSTT 13G S.ITTIER +70 190
>Joey: DEINPRU - +0 149
#note Evans was brilliantly setting up this challenge by playing FUROUR* and ATTS* in earlier games. He's smarter than he thinks. SLITTIER didn't sound familiar because it wasn't good until 2006.
>Evans: BEILNVY 3F ENVI.BLY +86 276
#note This completes a 210 point swing in a matter of minutes. I miss the opening bingo attack.
>Joey: DEINPRU C7 UNP.IRED +80 229
#note At least I knew I could play mine.  I'll need another.
>Evans: AEEEFHZ 10J FEEZE +44 320
#note Can't remember what my reasons were for FEEZE over FEAZE. I doubt they were good ones. Also: ZARF 12A is definitely worth considering here. With a 100-point lead, it's OK to give him a comeback Z play -- that's actually a safer option than giving him a monster bingo lane. I didn't think this through very well at all.
>Joey: AOOPVWX 2D VOW +30 259
>Evans: AACDDHS O7 CHAD +49 369
#note Well, that's a relief. I get to the spot before he does.
>Joey: AAHKOPX 1E HOAX +53 312
#note I didn't think of HAPAX.
>Evans: ADEFMRS 4B FAMED +30 399
#note When I'm on a losing streak, I tend to get paranoid about crazy ways to lose. Yeah, I saw FARMED, but I was terrified of him hitting something crazy like BARFLIES or SURFBOAT or somesuch.
>Joey: ABKLNPR 8A BA.K +45 357
>Evans: ENRSTUY N10 .NT.Y +16 415
#note Balances a little, scores a little, blocks a lane. Works for me.
>Joey: ELNNNPR C3 N.N +6 363
>Evans: EIRSSUU K5 ES +25 440
#note Scores a little, blocks another lane, leaves a tile in the bag. Things are looking good.
>Joey: AEGLNPR 14A PE.LAR +22 385
>Evans: GIORSUU 12A GU.U +14 454
#note The best way to block his GNAW outplay is GOS E9, for reasons I don't understand. Quackle is complicated.
>Joey: GNW 15G W.G +7 392
#note WYN scores 2 more points but still doesn't do what it says.
>Evans: IORS A12 .I.S +21 475
>Joey: N 5J ..N +4 396
>Joey: (OR) +4 400
