>Evans_Clinchy: ADEHOTW 8B TOWHEAD +86 86
#note Good start.
>Chris_Lipe: EFI 7G FIE +23 23
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIMSTT 9C MEET +28 114
#note You could make a case for TIME, keeping EST rather than IST, but five points seemed like a lot to give up.
>Chris_Lipe: IZ B6 ZI. +32 55
>Evans_Clinchy: ILNNSTV E8 ..NT +14 128
#note I'm not sure what in the world made me think fishing with ILNSV was a good idea. INVEST I4 is fine here.
>Chris_Lipe: ACDENOR 6I ACORNED +70 125
>Evans_Clinchy: ILNRSVX K5 V.X +26 154
#note Missing VERNIX N5, which I'm pretty sure would have been a better option here.
>Chris_Lipe: ACHI C3 CHIA +29 154
>Evans_Clinchy: ILNRRSU 4C .URL +14 168
#note Sim suggests blocking the triple with DURR or DURN. I wasn't that freaked out about a D in the triple-triple lane -- to me, it seemed better to keep a stronger leave and hope to break the game open with a bingo soon.
>Chris_Lipe: ?AIQ O4 QA.Is +72 226
>Evans_Clinchy: EGINORS M6 .EGRONIS +72 240
#note This is the highest scoring bingo, and also the one that seems least likely to allow a huge counterplay.
>Chris_Lipe: AFGILL 11H FALLI.G +22 248
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDDEEO H11 .ADED +33 273
#note Gotta keep scoring to stay ahead. This does the trick.
>Chris_Lipe: PT L10 T.P +20 268
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BEJOOU F2 JO.E +27 300
#note Perhaps the safer option is JOE 14F. But with the blank in hand, I thought it was fine to leave lanes open and go for the jugular.
>Chris_Lipe: AENSV 12A VANES +32 300
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BORSTU 15H .OUBTeRS +83 383
#note That worked out OK.
>Chris_Lipe: W 12H .W +10 310
>Evans_Clinchy: EMNOOPT G12 MOP +24 407
#note Scores, balances, blocks, works for me.
>Chris_Lipe: AIN A12 .INA +21 331
>Evans_Clinchy: BENOTUU E3 B.O +18 425
#note Hmmm, let's try sticking this B next to the O to block a bingo lane. That can't backfire, can it?
>Chris_Lipe: AEILRRS 3E ..RRELIAS +76 407
#note ...oh. Turns out it can. Awesome play by Chris, and it also highlights how dumb mine was. Zero bingos possible in the pool from that O.
>Evans_Clinchy: ENOTUUY H1 TO.Y +33 458
>Chris_Lipe: EGIKY 2L YIKE +29 436
#note Heh. I hated YIKE# (and actually had an inkling it was Collins-only), but wasn't about to risk the game on it. Would have been a 458-458 tie if I'd passed up a turn.
>Evans_Clinchy: ENUU 10I NE +14 472
#note Oops, JEON.
>Chris_Lipe: G L2 ..G +14 450
#note Crazy game.
>Chris_Lipe:  (UU) +4 454
