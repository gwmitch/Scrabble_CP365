>Jim_Burlant: DEHIORS 8G HOD +14 14
#note Quackle feels I am breaking up too much of this rack by playing off the D, docking me almost 5 points for this choice. Sim winner is 8H OH.
>Bruce_Ward: TY G7 T.Y +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIRRSU J2 RUInERS +68 82
#note Quackle prefers J5 pURSIER, J5 fRISEUR and a handful of other bingos over this by a handful of points.    They all score 68 points btw, no higher scoring options available.
>Bruce_Ward: CELT 3I C.LET +20 34
#note Best bingo for Bruce.  He's at 43%.
>Jim_Burlant: FJKLMOP 9C FOLK. +19 101
#note Right tiles, wrong play.  Board vision disappears at a crucial time; FOLK 4L is much, much better than this.
>Bruce_Ward: ?AAEILS 5E ALAnI.ES +74 108
#note ALKALIES or ALKALISE E5 score 78.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFJMP L1 JE.P. +44 145
#note 10B JAM wins, with this choice second; I felt that 44 points trumped 37 and a more marginal leave, even if he would probably come back for 33 on row 1.  Quackle disagrees slightly.
>Bruce_Ward: EOY 1L .OEY +42 150
>Jim_Burlant: AAAFMNQ 2N FA +25 170
#note Whiffing on QANA(T) 7C.  This is second best, but at quite a hefty equity loss.
>Bruce_Ward: MNOU 8A MUON +29 179
>Jim_Burlant: AADMNOQ 7E QA. +12 182
#note Best.  Why couldn't I have found QANAT on the previous turn?
>Bruce_Ward: CW A6 CW. +10 189
>Jim_Burlant: ADDIMNO 4C DOM +16 198
#note F9 KIDDO is the other play worth considering here, but this takes over the sim after 400 or so 2-ply iterations.
>Bruce_Ward: GIV 3B VIG +23 212
>Jim_Burlant: AADIIIN -AIII +0 198
#note Quackle prefers 7J RADII, 7I IRID,  and 4G AI.  AI doesn't get rid of enough I's, and I think either of the row 7 plays score nothing and give back way too much for not-so-hot leaves.
>Bruce_Ward: BR G3 BR. +8 220
>Jim_Burlant: AADNOTX E9 .AX +20 218
#note I figured this would play for 20 and probably give back more, but my gut said that whatever would overlap the X would probably create a hook on row 13 or 14 that would help break up the gridlock.  And that's pretty much what happened a few turns later.  This play sims best btw, and I'm at 40% despite my blunders on turns 3 and 5.
>Bruce_Ward: AUV 2C VAU +17 237
>Jim_Burlant: ADENORT D8 ..TED +23 241
#note Blind to the board.  1A TOAD is much, much better than this!
>Bruce_Ward: DGO C11 DOG +24 261
>Jim_Burlant: AINNORS I8 .ON +5 246
#note Quackle prefers that I take out 1E with NORIA.  I'd rather open another bingo line so he can't shut the board down.
>Bruce_Ward: EIT 6A .ITE +8 269
>Jim_Burlant: AINRRSS 11I SARI +13 259
#note Board vision disappears again; 1A RIAS wins the sim.
>Bruce_Ward: AHO B12 HAO +22 291
>Jim_Burlant: EEGINRS M7 GREISEN +77 336
#note Now at 74% winning chances.
>Bruce_Ward: ETU 8L T.UE +15 306
>Jim_Burlant: AEEINPZ O6 PE. +5 341
#note Just wanted to block any bingo I might not have known down the O column.  I was pretty sure he didn't have anything, but I figured that, since he couldn't do much on row 1, NAZI could wait.
>Bruce_Ward: NW 12L N.W +16 322
