#note just OE or even fishing the O are also very competitive here.

#note her last play was initially crushing, blocking my 7 and 8 without giving a bingo back - thank goodness I kept looking

#note challenging play with no clear winning options. COUSIN at B10 is strong. I considered WHOA but didn't like the CISU leave enough, and OW at 14B seemed to block good plays for her but while leaving an ugly leave. I like COUSIN in retrospect.

#note quackle thinks that not bingoing is a competitive option, but I disagree - the board is already very closed, and cecilia will not open as quackle sim might be expecting.
>Cecilia: ADISTWX -  +0 225
#note my bingo drew a challenge here.
>JD: IMOOQTV 15L OMIT +27 263
#note her challenged suggested to me that she probably doesn't have a huge play on column A, so I was reluctant to play VOMITOS and potentially bail her out with a high scoring play. the setup is kinda obvious, but still a competitive option.
>Cecilia: AEGNU A5 UN.AGE +27 252
#note setting up a dangerous X spot

>JD: AAOTTVV D4 OTT.VA +26 335
#note creates a Z hotspot, but taking that would block the X spot

#note effectively a waiting move since I don't want to open.
>Cecilia: ABBL C1 BLAB +20 368
>JD: AELPRRW 1A WA. +24 415
#note she was low on time so I wanted to get a play down fast. after WAB she only bingos 6%, although GLEEK at 2B might be problematic for me.
>Cecilia: AEK E3 KAE +23 391
#note ran out of time
>JD: EELPRRT M7 PERT +17 432
#note one point better to start with LEHR - PERT gives back better plays on column N.
