#note I wasn't quite sure what to do here. It doesn't help that I flat out missed ERUV. Guess it's still too new. TU(N)DRA and JURAT are simming a bit ahead of my play, so undoubling the R's might be a priority over unloading the V. VAUNT is definitely a couple points back of plays that I turned down and/or missed so this isn't a great turn

#note Maybe 4J NAIF? I was kind of getting nervous with ??SSS unseen and the big SCUD hook open, so I wanted to turn over more tiles. Seems fine I guess

#note I considered GOGO to cripple the scoring/bingo lines around that Y. But I knew she wasn't bingoing this turn with HOH at least.

#note Phony. Not really sure why I risked this when GONG is just as good. Oh well

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGLOORU L8 .OLOUR +21 359
#note Ugh, missed COLUGO here. Not a huge difference between the plays since the G works well with what's unseen, but missing obvious sixes isn't good

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEGILST 14J GESTE +29 388
#note Weak finish to a shaky first game. I thought there were six tiles in the bag, and that I could play this to outrun any bingos on the B column. I definitely panicked when I pulled all five tiles out of the bag. I flushed a bit of win percentage down the toilet here, but at least it didn't cost me.
