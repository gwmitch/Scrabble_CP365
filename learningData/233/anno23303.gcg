#note not sure why I went with this option, the G's weakness makes up for keeping the R. just GROW looks normal.

#note I dunno. ENGAGER at 11E is 36 and AEGNR isn't such a powerhouse leave, but I still like slowing down the game. BUG is 5 extra, but also clogs my bingo lanes on row 11 and 12. quackle thinks my move is a big mistake, but I don't think I have a choice.

>JD: AEGINRR K1 RANGIER +73 141
#note I chose this instead of RANGIER for 5 more because it sets up -ING bingos on row 4 - I need 2 or 3 more bingos and lanes to go with them. after RANGIER or ANGRIER at N1, jerry can play on row 1 and potentially block column K. Quackle does bear out that playing on column K produces more bingos, so maybe there was some validity to my thought process.

#note looks like too little too late. I thought that putting a vowel at H12 was too prone to letting jerry score.
