#note Not crazy about blocking this bingo line, but my options are slim. I can keep the J or I can exchange. I decided to roll the dice with TAJ. If I draw a vowel and get a bingo down, I'll have a lead on a dead board.

#note I considered this and KORAI. Either way I'm going to be opening the board. I just settled on the more workable leave. I didn't see DEFY.

#note This is a bad play at a bad time. I'm setting up all sorts of plays that I don't have, in particular the X. And it's not even that good of an equity play. KAURI is a clear improvement and I just didn't see it.

#note I figured he'd probably not have too many big tiles after QI. In any case, I think this desperate play is necessary at this point
