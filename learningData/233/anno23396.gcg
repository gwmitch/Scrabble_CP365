#note A few close options. I considered A4 GAIT, but didn't think long enough about just GI in that spot. But I think WAFTAGE is better, since it's not a good board to try and bingo with CLEAT

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CILLRTT D11 TILL +18 192
#note Maybe T(A)LC to take out that A column? I decided to just play for equity and hope Joel couldn't do too much with the S hook. If he doesn't have an S, he may give up points to block.

#note I considered B13 CRY, but figured the leave was no better than CNRST. I didn't spot D1 CRUMBY, however, which certainly seems safer. I dunno, though. I don't mind rolling the dice here with the 5-conso leave. It bingos a little less often, but it avoids giving back the easy lane into the triple. And it scores 5 more points. All three of these plays sim basically even.
