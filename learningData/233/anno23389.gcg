#note Not a good board to be fishing on, but I wasn't sure what else to do. I was going to do SAUTED, but had doubts that it was good (maybe it's just SAUTEED?). Trading isn't too bad though

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEIOSTV 13B OVATE +35 243
#note I played this immediately and realized after that I just set up a huge hook for no reason. VOTE is clearly what I want to do here. Ugh, not playing well this game
