>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEHNNY D8 .HEENY +30 30
#note PHONY! It's WEENY only. I should be doing the beautiful 9C YENNED instead of this phony anways. -1.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ITU F8 .TUI +6 36
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEFNOX 13A FOX. +34 64
#note Best play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: JO 10B JO. +26 62
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEIINO 14A ANI +24 88
#note Best play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: ER 15A RE +27 89
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEIOOP 7G OPA +19 107
#note Best play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ABOOTT -?ABO +0 89
#note Exchange 4.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEIOR 6I ODEA +12 119
#note This play was horrible. 6H OE for 10 seems gravy and is Quackle's favorite. All of the plays suck on this turn. -7.3
>Harriette_Lakernick: DEINORT L5 R.TIONED +70 159
#note Not only that, ODEA gives her a spot for a dead rack. Totally unacceptable on my part. L1 ORDINATE is 2 more but riskier.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGIIRRR K11 RERIG +19 138
#note Best play! I am rewarded by the tile gods with a horrible rack for my incompetence, but find the best play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: LMSU 15K .LUMS +27 186
#note GLUMS is good but not GRUMS*. I held briefly, mentally sorted it out and then correctly accepted.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGINQR 14J Q. +31 169
#note Best play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: OVW O12 VOW. +14 200
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGINRT 5C TANGIER +70 239
#note 2nd best play! ARRGH! I knew I missed something better. E2 GRATINEE is 74 and avoides opening the H triple line. What comes next is unlucky, but should never have happened. -4
>Harriette_Lakernick: ABLZ H1 BLAZ. +78 278
#note That was unlucky.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IIILTT -LIIT +0 239
#note Talk about being lucky and unlucky on the same turn! TITI 4B instead of trading. I just traded, kept IT? and went for the bingo. Not sure.
>Harriette_Lakernick: FHS 3G F.HS +18 296
#note Wise block by Harriette. Things look bleak now.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?CGIKOT 5K T.ICK +26 265
#note Somehow this is best! Ordinarily, TROCK is preferred, but there are too many I's in the pool so TRICK is better.
>Harriette_Lakernick: CNSU O1 SNUC. +42 338
#note This is another horrible break for me. BLAZE and then SNUCK off of two fairly optimal plays!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAGOTU 4A GOUT +20 285
#note 6th best play! I knew GAdABOUT, but that word is really hard to see when your clock is winding down and the blank is a D try it! Although Quackle disgrees, I think this is 2nd best play instead of the 6th best because it scores 20 and opens an extra lane for Harriette to defend. I debated between this and GOUT in the same spot. AA? is a better leave than AU? by -1.5. AA? also allows easier access to ABLE and ABLY bingos which I certainly saw. However, this play is still -20.5 and a terrible miss! 
>Harriette_Lakernick: IV A2 VI. +7 345
#note If Harriette doesn't block this...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAELMY 1C AMEnA.LY +67 352
#note ...I had AMYGdALE which I knew for a 3x3! Would I have seen it? I looked at it more recently than GADABOUT so there is a 50-60% chance I would have seen it for the 3x3. AMENABLY is the best play and only bingo. I was kicking myself because I only saw MEALYBUG at first which I would have had if I kept AU?. MEALYBUG is the only 8 in ABELMUY? as well! Anyways, I'm proud at myself for drilling this. If there anything I can do well fairly consistently, it's drilling bingos in crunch time situations with my clock winding down to win games.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ADILST H7 ..TALoIDS +83 428
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ADILST --  -83 345
#note Actual rack! All Harriette needs to do is play DISAVOWS keeping LT? for the sure win and me wondering what if I played GADABOUT. However, she tries PETALOIDS* and empties the bag. I would have challenged PETALOIDS* anyway since I know it's strictly a singular, and this mistake cost her the game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDEINO 2A .INED +27 379
#note I don't see DISAVOWS either. But I win anyway. VINED is good because it allows me a guaranteed out in 2. Also, note the possibility of (RE)SLATeD for 37 in addition to DISAVOWS for 45. Some tricky endgame finds!
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ADILST H7 ..DALISTs +86 431
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?ADILST --  -86 345
#note There isn't a bingo that plays through the PE- or anywhere on the board period. Harriette just needs to do DISAVOWS or RESLATED and take a closer loss. PEDALISTS is way too in my probability range for me to let go. Plus it's an outplay!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABO 2J ABO +15 394
#note Best play! Along with the 6C ABO for the same amount.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ADILST?) +14 408
