>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEHTUX H7 XU +18 18
#note Interesting turn. In the end, I think this play made the most sense. Keep my leave flexible and reduce Matthew's counterplay.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CCDENSV G6 VEND +23 23
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEHOTY 7F D..Y +19 37
#note Continuing my logic from last turn. Let's see what the champ can do on one of these boards. But really, let's not see a strategic game like this one get reduced to... well, you'll see
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACCEGPS I4 CAG. +10 33
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHOOQT 10F QuOTH +52 89
#note Let the Scrabble end on a fun note of "when to use one's blank for only 50 points"
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEEEGPS 5H C.GE +14 47
#note I hated playing this since it's going to lead to an awful board with me behind a bingo. But 11G EPEE just didn't seem like it would go anywhere. Thats the sim winner though
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIMNOT 11I AMNIOTE +77 166
#note This is the beginning of the end of Matthew Tunnicliffe being a 3/1 favourite over me.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEENPS O8 APN.A +24 71
>Joshua_Sokol: BBEGIOR 12C GOBBIER +79 245
>Joshua_Sokol: BBEGIOR --  -79 166
#note Or is it?

One day, I will stop playing words I am unsure of in precarious situations. For an anarcho-communist, I display quite the greed.

Was thinking of GABBIER/BAGGIER, not GOBBIER*/BOGGIER. I knew there was a pair somewhere.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEOSUW K9 WA.E +24 95
>Joshua_Sokol: BBEGIOR 11C BOGIE +36 202
#note But it's OK, I'm still ahead 100 points on a relatively good board for an overdog. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIIOSUZ C9 ZE.US +52 147
>Joshua_Sokol: ABJRSTU D8 JAT.S +57 259
#note At this point I started to get very angry at what was occurring in this game. It wasn't right. I had lost a full turn in a vulnerable position and I was maintaining an 100-point lead on one of the top Scrabble players in the world.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIILLOT M9 LO.IE +12 159
#note 13M OIL is the play I want. I had some doubts on APNEAL, but why wouldn't it be good if APNOEAL is? Silly
>Joshua_Sokol: BEKNRUU 4K BURKE +28 287
#note And on turn 15, I finally decide to play a smidgeon of defense when I could have done otherwise. I would go on about when there was a time to block an extra bingo lane for a reduced short-term gain, but I could have done almost anything this game and my opponent would have just painstakingly responded with a vowel dump or a desperation play of some sort.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EILLOTW N9 OW. +33 192
>Joshua_Sokol: DINORSU 13K DU. +13 300
#note Hopefully at this point I don't need to explain that I am not a good enough player to win a game in this fashion, and that I am not a bad enough player to be able to justify missing two words that everyone at my level would see instantly. I honestly just didn't remember either of the words, although I knew there must have been something in the rack I had. "But guys, look at that brilliant defensive play!"

>Joshua_Sokol: IINOORS O1 OI +14 314
#note I shot profanity Matt's way when he made his last play, as it was one of those spots in which he excels. Playing a word that is probably phony in a position where it is definitely correct to let it slide, if there is even a shadow of a doubt at its invalidity... As Phil Laak put it best after getting bluffed at a poker table by Tom Dwan, "You always put people into that hyper-flux area."

O1 OSI(E)R may be correct here, although I really want to keep an S here to prevent Matthew from a likely setup.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DIIILRT 6I .ILD +18 252
>Joshua_Sokol: INOPRSV 10B V.. +14 328
#note Keeping E8 OP for next turn if he doesn't open anything up, and blocking the left side from ever being opened. Couldn't ask for a better position.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIIRRTT L3 T.R. +13 265
>Joshua_Sokol: INOPRRS E8 OP +27 355
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIIIMRT -II +0 265
#note Plan is to set up UTA once my leave is good enough
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNRRRS -IIIIA +0 355
#note Seemed LS was the best leave for the pool. I kind of expected what happened to happen, drawing a duplicate after VET and then scoring into a very bad leave for the tile pool. Nothing remotely worth complaining about, but it was definitely a thought I had in mind.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAIMNRT L13 .T +2 267
>Joshua_Sokol: FIILOSS 15H FILOS +31 386
#note I drew another S. At least he probably has the other blank...
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAHIMNR 14I MA +14 281
#note I think I was under a minute at this point
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEFIRS B13 IFS +14 400
#note But no, I drew the damn blank after all of that... What a disaster from all perspectives.

I joshed about how brilliant this play was after the game. Can you see what I was going for? Answer in the next slide.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AHIINNR 15A A.H +18 299
#note Josh: Come on guys, look for it, don't just move on hoping I will spill the beans!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEERRR 6E RE. +13 413
#note Well, this definitely wasn't what I was going for. In essence, I saw that Matthew had played his M off, where an H could have been played for 2 more points. It didn't seem logical that he would have had the H for his play, so I allowed myself to hope I could draw probably the only available bingo on the board, THEREIN(TO) or WHEREIN(TO).


>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IINNNR F2 RINN.. +9 308
#note *
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EERR 3C vER.ER +12 425
#note RIN is indeed a verb, but it means to run, and shares a past participle with its original form, RAN. RINNED* is a tricky phony!


>Joshua_Sokol:  (IN) +4 429
#note In actuality, there are 23 9-letter words in TWLthat end in -TO. I could have hit 2 others, MANIFES(TO) and SANBENI(TO).
