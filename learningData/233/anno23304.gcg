#note WIND is a bit better I think, though it's kind of close.

#note BLI(N)D is nice to keep balance and make the board hard to use, though that isn't really my goal right now. I considered mainly just BATON and ABOIL and a few phonies. BATON doesn't do anything towards opening the board, which I didn't like. I also considered CEBID but that can easily be paralleled. DEIL could hit the N for sure, and I could open next turn. The play I missed is (SO)LD which sets up SOLDI, which matt likely doesn't know, or still has to address somehow. 
>Matt_Canik: ACDDGIN 10G DA.CING +17 90
#note I would definitely take ADDING here. DANCING doesn't really obstruct much, leaving a few marginal lanes. ADDING still blocks the DOWNS hook, giving up a wide open DGIN. My range is very bingo heavy but I don't bingo much more often after ADDING than after DANCING. 
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEILQZ 9K QI +24 59
#note hard to say here - matt could be holding basically anything, so I'm hoping he either hits this spot small or has a big play elsewhere for some reason leaving it. Maybe I can also draw something down H column.
>Matt_Canik: ?DEMRRU 11B RUMoRED +74 164
#note MURDERs looks good.
>Jackson_Smylie: DEEHILZ 8L HIDE +46 105
#note I was thinking of setting up AD for ADZ if he didn't take the ZIN spot, with something like HEILED, but he did it for me! ADZ is fairly likely to stay open. HELD maybe? IZE is fairly strong here, perhaps more so than ELZ. also HIDE is easily paralleled. 
>Matt_Canik: FHILRUY B9 FU.RILY +30 194
>Jackson_Smylie: EEKLLMZ 12H ZEK +49 154
#note damn ZYME!! I could play LEKE or something to keep the M spot and Z spot for next turn, but I think the 20 points is worth it here with the M spot open still. 
>Matt_Canik: BEEHIOT A5 THEBE +35 229
#note BOEHMITE and BOTHIE
>Jackson_Smylie: AEELLMN 13H ENAMEL +41 195
#note normally I'd play something like LAM - leaves the 13 row open, EELN is arguably more bingo prone than L... but with the E open on the O column and really no good 7s prospects for EELN unless I draw an A and a 13 row bingo, or an N column bingo, I think going for the blank could be better.
>Matt_Canik: EEIOOUV D11 .OVIE +22 251
#note CUVEE maybe to block that lane a bit?

>Jackson_Smylie: ?AEFRSV N6 FA. +30 317
#note a few options I can take here - FAVES, VARS, and FAD. Matt has a random rack, so there is a 1/3 chance I pull the 2nd S after FAVES, which puts my chances quite high, cause of JUCOS or bingoes. playing VARS now basically hopes I outrun, but with the other S out and KAYS and KAYO, I'm not sure I could outrun consistently. VARS does leave 4 in the bag and keeps a scoring consonant (for future FAD plays), so drawing an S or W would help a lot here, perhaps winning in either case. Lastly, FAD could potentially outrun if I hit JUCOS next turn, but also has the added flexibility of bingoing very often. FAVES is encouraging because it sort of banks the game on who draws the S (I could also use my blank, so in a way I am banking on the 8/15 chance he DOESN'T have the S), whereas FAD lets me fish/outscore in the future. 
>Matt_Canik: AEOORUW B4 WOO +17 368
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AEIRSV L1 VARS +50 367
#note silly me... I didn't look hard enough in the 2 row, missing SAVoRIE(R) and RAVIShE(R)!!! I delibrated VIES and VARS for too long when I should have been using my last minutes bingo-searching. I had difficulty putting matt on a range here - definitely not S of course, and more likely vowels, but still could keep a lot because not many other plays will obstruct the lane this much. Maybe NOON he'd play if he had it. also thinking maybe not an E cause he might want to keep an O for KAYO, so he'd play WOE if he had that. this being said, I think he's slightly vowel heavy usually, so keeping EI? could go out more often (which is what I need to do to win, I think). hitting the G and V and paralleling WOO requires an E often. I can't be sure about his range, but if I think he doesn't have an E I should probably go ahead and play VIES, cause AR? will do well with an E draw. I think even as it is, I should have played to keep AR? cause the pool is ultimately vowel heavy, and ar? has fewer problem draws than EI?. also I should just bingo.

champ suggests AS or AIS but I somehow struggle to see how those work out.
