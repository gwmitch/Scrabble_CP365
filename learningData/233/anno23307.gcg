#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?AOPTUW 8F OUTWrAP +78 78
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?AOPTUW --  -78 0
#note Had to think about this for 40 seconds but remembered somebody played this on a Cross Tables games and discovered this was phony. Off it came.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGIINN 8G GAIN +10 10
#note My play is worse than I thought. GENII best. INNAGE is also good too. Mine is -5.6 back.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?AOPTUW 9F POW +18 18
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEILNR 10E BERLINE +79 89
#note Best play! Thankfully I draw into this and find the best spot.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?ACMTUV -  +0 18
#note Tim unsuccessfully challenges BERLINE.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIKTTUW 11C DUIT +23 112
#note 2nd best play! I had no clue what to do with this rack but it appears I chose well. TWIT C11 for 27 is best. This is only -3.1 back. I'll live with my play.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: HTU 11K HUT +22 40
>Jonathan_Lindh: CIKQSTW 7I QI +44 156
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AENV 6J VANE +29 69
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACKSTWY N2 WACKS +42 198
#note 4th best play! I missed the rock star play L3 TWANKY for 40. I knew TWANKY, but I did not see TWANKY. This isn't bad but burns an S and allows me to get hit with a vicious snapback. At least I got the highest scoring play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: COZ M1 COZ +55 124
#note That should not have happened.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DLSTUYY N11 STUDY +25 223
#note Best play! Another play I had no clue what to do one but it appears I chose wisely.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: OPR 5K POR. +32 156
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILORTY 4K OY +27 250
#note I suspected I missed something. I was right. ELYTROID was a terrible, terrible miss. I saw 2 of the 8's with this rack, RHYOLITE and TOILETRY, but not ELYTROID. At least mine is the best play other than the 2 ELYTROID plays. -24.2
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ELX O1 LEX +55 211
#note Really regretting missing TWANKY now.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEIJLT 12B JET +27 277
#note 2nd best play! Right letters but I miss JET on J2 for 5 more. Whatever, my play worked out better. -5
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: O 15N .O +15 226
#note Tim close to a bingo? This isn't a volatile spot. If Tim isn't fishing I'm not sure why he did this, but then again, I don't know his rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEILRT 13D ATELIER +62 339
#note Best play! RETAILED and ELATERID are available for 61 but this is clearly best because of the way it shuts down the board.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: NU B12 .UN +20 246
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAABMNT A13 NAB +19 358
#note Bad post bingo draw and a mediocre play. This play has merit because it keeps the board shut. The excellent H1 TAMBAC for 39 throws the board wide open. I only considered plays at A13 and H12. Mine I feel is the best of A13 plays, but TAMBAC going for the turnover with 2 blanks out seems best. -20.9
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EFR H12 F.RE +33 279
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAAMNT 15C ANATh.MA +60 418
#note Best play! And only bingo! Bailed out by a blank draw and a good placement of an E by Tim. With two blanks out, this play is why I shied away from MINA H12 a few turns earlier.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?EGIMOS -  +0 279
#note Tim unsuccessfuly challenges again.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIIORV C9 VI.. +12 430
#note IVIED 14J for 16 is a great squeeze play <insert Dan Terkell voice>. Mine isn't good but the game is not in doubt. -16.8
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: HOS 12L HO.S +28 307
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEIORR 8G ....ER +8 438
#note Seems fine enough.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DGO J2 DOG +16 323
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGIIOR I1 GID +15 453
#note I need to block Quackle. Tim's rack is good here.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?AEFILS 1F FLA. +24 347
#note The 33 point plays that burn the blank all sim much better than FLAG for Tim. SELFING, LEAFING, FEASING. Take your big. Tim's play is 9th best and -14.2 back which surprised me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIMOR 2B MOIRE +25 478
#note Best play! Maybe because FLAG gives up MOIRE.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?EIS E2 .ISEs +8 355
#note 3C IDES for 19 is best along with many others but Tim was low on time. -11
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr:  (E) +2 357
#note Score recorded as 478-353. Tim lost 4 points somewhere.
