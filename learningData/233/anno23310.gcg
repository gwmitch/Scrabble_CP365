>Jonathan_Lindh: NNOOSTU -NOU +0 0
#note What a dreadul opening rack. I'm liking UNTO here instead of exchanging. Why did I exchange here? -3.4
>Al_Helfgott: OWW 8G WOW +18 18
>Jonathan_Lindh: CENOPST 9F COP +18 18
#note Best play along with COPEN 9F for 27! I like my play!
>Al_Helfgott: AINO 10G NAOI +17 35
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BENRST 11B BuRNETS +79 97
#note Best play! I took time to find the overlap that maximized my points.
>Al_Helfgott: AIR B10 A.RI +8 43
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIIKMT 11J TIKI +18 115
#note 3rd best play! Surprisingly, EMIT keeping IIK is best by a narrow margin. A13 KIT for 27 is 2nd according to Quackle. Too many I's for my taste! Balance first and then take one of the two triple word spots. -1.7 to Q but I like my play.
>Al_Helfgott: IQ 10M QI +24 67
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIIMRT A12 EMIT +28 143
#note Best play!
>Al_Helfgott: AGM A8 GAM +22 89
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEILORU D9 OU.IE +10 153
#note 3rd best play to Quackle! I like my mine. KUE L11 and 13A MILIEU seem too vowel heavy. I get turnover and open up another spot if Al scores well on this turn. -1.1 to Quackle but I like mine more.
>Al_Helfgott: ?DEEGNR O4 GENDERs +91 180
#note Best play for Al! I was torched by a number of really high scoring words this afternoon.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EJLORYZ C7 JOY +34 187
#note Best play!
>Al_Helfgott: ADELOST 5H DESOLAT. +68 248
#note Best play! And only bingo. Ouch. I did not need that.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DELNRUZ 4K LEZ +41 228
#note Best play!
>Al_Helfgott: CEL C13 CEL +26 274
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADNNRU 4D RUANA +16 244
#note 10th best play! M3 AZAN! I like that much better than my play. My play shuts the board down too much. I think I'm toast no matter what but no need to make mistakes -11.3
>Al_Helfgott: DVY F3 D.VY +19 293
#note RUANA was a bigger mistake than initially thought because it allowed Al to clear off DVY for a decent amount.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDEHNP L11 .APH +26 270
#note This turn lost me the game. it's reasonable but 3C BANDED or HANDED are better and don't give Al a massive snapback. Play these and I'm down 15 0r 13 with a chance to win. Mine was 4th best and -7.2. Reasonable but not right. Also note 3rd best M2 HAZAN for 34 and a good chance to win.
>Al_Helfgott: AEFSX 15H FAXES +63 356
#note REALLY unlucky but I guess I did deserve that. However, if I did BANDED or HANDED, Al still has FAS at K12 for 41 putting him up 54 on a dead board. I think I was toast no matter what I did in this game sadly.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEGNRU H1 BEG.. +27 297
#note Best play! I love this play as it scores, grooms my rack nicely and opens up bingo lanes!
>Al_Helfgott: ENRTU 1H .URNET +9 365
#note Al was going to play around the X but wisely decided to block with a bingo lead and bingo lines open. I had UNBRIDLE if Al didn't block this lane. Wise move by Al. We all had a good laugh when BURNETS and BURNET appeared on the board together!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEILNRU 14G RIDE +26 323
#note UNDERLIP, UNDERLIE, UNDERLIT, UNBRIDLE. All are blocked or go off the board. I saw all of them too! Maybe M3 IZAR here? No hope in bingoing now so just take the points.
>Al_Helfgott: FHOOSTV 6I THO +32 397
>Jonathan_Lindh: ILNUV 8L VIL. +11 334
#note Not a good draw to pick up on the final turn. LUPIN 13J for 24 is cool but leaves me V stuck if Al tracked right so he could slow play and make things worse for me. I think this is best along with VINE in the same spot as Al has SOFA in two places.
>Al_Helfgott: AFOS 2L SOFA +18 415
#note Best play for Al. Also note the lesser SOFA at 3A for 16 and FAROS at D2 for 8. Al had outs no matter what.
>Al_Helfgott:  (NU) +4 419
#note I played well this game, but RUANA and KAPH were mistakes for sure even though they were decent from the equity side. I didn't have a lot of good luck today, but battled my way through to be 3-3 and played fairly well, at least 1700+ for sure and maybe even 1900 or so.
