>Al_Helfgott: DEIOSTT 8D DOTIEST +70 70
#note Al and Jon go HAM on a Scrabble board! What happens when Al Helfgott and Jonathan Lindh take a blowtorch to a Scrabble board? This happens! This was probably the most incredible Scrabble game I have ever been apart of. 1042 combined points, and the first 600+ point showing on any side in a game I have been apart of. Surprisingly, Quackle likes the 8G placement of this word for 68 and .1 points more but I strongly disagree. This is right for Al. (NOTE: Al did not record his racks so his only full racks are bingo racks. Disregard rest of his full racks.)
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEGNOS 7C GONE +14 14
#note Al blocks CONGEES! D2 CONGEED is supposedly best, but it's a tossup between that and playing GE in various places to fish with CONES or 7G GONE, which is my play. This is -3.1 equity back but not really mistake, if at all. This is the 3rd best play according to Quackle but I'd do mine again.
>Al_Helfgott: AEEETVW 6F WEAVE +35 105
#note I believe Al said this was his rack. If so, this is best. This was my word fear with play. This play also blocked the incredible 2x2 CLEANOUTS, which I knew. It's new!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACELSTU B3 SULCATE +71 85
#note Best play! And only bingo!
>Al_Helfgott: EJT 4A J.TE +38 143
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDIKLPU 5J PLUCK +30 115
#note 6th best play! Here's a pivotal play! K2 CUPID is best for 33. I didn't see. I debated between PUCK and PLUCK at 5J. I should have done PUCK. Al was going to bingo anyway but this was insult to injury and where things get really crazy! -5.1
>Al_Helfgott: IMQRSUY O5 SQUIRMY +127 270
#note Best play! I kid you not! He had SQUIRMY. This would have played at C9 for 97 anyway but still...come on! It get better! First 100+ bingo!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADIINO N11 OIDIA +17 132
#note I'm not sure what my rack was here. If this was it A8 IODIN is best for 29 and this 3rd best at -2.4 back. I'm so far back I need to jack up board volatility to come back and bingo. No matter what my leave was, this is a top 5 play, and maybe even the best, but I'm not so sure.
>Al_Helfgott: ?AEEHNN 13G ENHANcE. +82 352
#note Playing IODIN if I had it would have blocked this carnage and bingos at A8 or C9. A8 ENHANCE is 6 more for Al, but gives back mindless points if I have a D,R, or S. This right I think. Check out the 10 letter NEPENTHEAN at J3! That's flashy but not the right play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AHINORX 14G HOAX +67 199
#note Best play! Watch the next play!
>Al_Helfgott: ?AFILRZ A9 FRAZILs +139 491
#note What in the world is this black magic? This is best! Wow! That's 100+ point bingo #2.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFIINNR 12A .INNIA +30 229
#note 3rd best play according to Quackle! I debated between this and FIAR at 15L which Quackle thinks is best. I like mine better. AINN is not a good leave on this board. I'll work with FR and keep volatility higher. I also wanted to open a bingo lane for myself and a high scoring one at that. 2nd place H1 FARINA deserves consideration. I saw the possibility of FARINA but didn't see the spot. All 3 of these plays are within .8 equity of each other so pick your poison.
>Al_Helfgott: ABDEGOO 15H BO +33 524
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDFLRR 15L FL.B +39 268
#note Best play! Double R's with this leave are actually not bad and are workable.
>Al_Helfgott: IM C9 MI +18 542
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADEPRR 11E PARADER +100 368
#note Best play! 3rd 100+ bingo of the day! I was only 70% sure this was good, but I thought I saw this before. I did. I'm making the score respectable.
>Al_Helfgott: OUY 10J YOU +29 571
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENOSTV E2 VEST +26 394
#note Quackle wants me to fish with 14A LEV, but I decided to cash out with VEST and try and hit 400. I assumed Al would block. The remaining pool is TOR in the bag. Looking back, maybe I should have fished. TESTOON and TOSTONE are the 7 that are possible. I don't think any 8's are possible. I need to draw NO out of the bag and Al needs to not interfere with the 7 line. If Al tries and block, STENTOR might be possible with a TR draw. Maybe I should have fished? Not sure.
>Al_Helfgott: DEGGIRW 3B .EW.D +27 598
#note Actual rack for Al. 7H WIRED for 29 is best leaving EGG E3 to go out according to Quackle. This 4th best and -7.3 back.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENOORT M9 ORT +17 411
#note My endgame was -8. I think ORT is right but I need to do OVEN next turn which I somehow missed. ORT -> OVEN it is. ROVEN C2 is cool but given up GIG on the triple line for 22.
>Al_Helfgott: GGIR 7H GI +15 613
#note This is Al's best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENO M3 ON.E +12 423
#note 3rd best play! Well, I lost points in this endgame. OVEN 2D for 20. Mine was 3rd best. -8.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (GR) +6 429
#note Excellent played game on both sides! While certain minor errors did end backfiring, Al was going to win no matter what. We combined for 1042 points. 613 surpasses Bill Rexhausen's 591 game against me as the most number of points scored on me. Congratulations Al!
