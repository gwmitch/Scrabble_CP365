#note 11A F(O)RAM for 36. FAD over FAB according to CP, likely because of the synergy of the BM over DM.

#note This missed bingo probably cost me the game. All loving and no romance makes Scrabble a hard mistress, evidently.

#note CP likes playing two tiles, and HI at A14 for 26. It's next choices, in order, are N1 UH, B2 WITH, and then my play. This is very curious, so I ran a 10k 2-ply sim. It revealed that UH is best, followed by WE at A14, and then WI(T)CH. Perhaps it wants to limit the chances at drawing the unseen Q, hence only playing two tiles. But if that is so, why would you play off the case U? Any Scrabble sleuths out there who can provide an explanation?

#note CP says there's still a 25 percent chance to win the game if I hold back playing the Q and ditch OE, for 14 at A14, or at 10F with EO(N) for 10, or at D2 setting up a nice hot spot. I haven't figured out yet what tile in the bag could lead to the win, and how. I thought it was likely to be one of the two remaining unseen Os, since 2/8 is 25 percent, but I've tested that to no avail. The only way I can win is if the S is in the bag, as I see it, but how is that a 25 percent chance? Stumped right now.
