#note I didn't know BUNYA. BUY is better I guess, I dislike Gs.

#note DI(V)INELY maybe.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AENOPT L1 PhAETON +78 110
#note I was looking for words that landed the P on the double and didn't open up the triple... I managed to miss NOTEPAd. I would have liked to make BRAE rather than BRAN because of the hooks, but all of the words that made BRAE take the D, like PHONATE and PRONATE.
>Jim_Nanavati: GINRV H10 R.VING +42 189
>Jackson_Smylie: AAEMRTZ D8 ZAM.A +52 162
#note I would rather not rely on bingoing to catch up, and ZAMIA gets me close. My only worry was a counter play from him hitting the Z for 45 or more. Quackle likes ZAMIA, and it keeps a nice leave anyways.

#note That worked out quite nicely.

#note I was thinking I would save ABHPRW for scoring plays next turn, but I could just play those now because they may be blocked next turn.

#note (E)MDASH is cool. SMO(O)CH is a bit of an improvement. No big deal though.
