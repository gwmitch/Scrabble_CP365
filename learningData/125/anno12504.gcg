>Matt: AAEFIJZ 8G JIZ +38 38
#note JAFA keeping EIZ is better than this.  Silly mistake, the first of many in this one.
>Brian: ?AABCIL 9A BACIlLA +74 74
#note It's BACILLI and BACILLAR, no BACILLA*.  I thought I had seen this word somewhere so I didn't bat an eye when it was played.  
>Matt: AAEFHKN 8A AH +32 70
#note KHAF helps prevent the board from being shut down so quickly, plus it scores more.  Got tunnel vision.
>Brian: EXY 10G YEX +26 100

>Brian: ABDL E11 BALD +27 155
>Matt: EGHPQST 15A PESH +48 178
>Matt: EGHPQST --  -48 130
#note HESP#! That's what I wanted to come up with, but played this instead.  Just awful, especially since my rack is clunky and I'm behind.  
>Brian: ISTW 15A WIST +33 188
>Matt: EGHPQST -GHQ +0 130
#note Now I need a bingo and quickly, or that was my rationale.  EPHAH does score 39 but that QG combo is going nowhere fast.  Thought EPST > EHST, but keeping the H for 10B in case I need to fish is a good idea.
>Brian: DNO B12 NOD. +22 210
>Matt: EPPRSTU B7 P..T +18 148
#note PUHA#.  I need to learn my Collins fours better, because PHAT just led to getting stomped.
>Brian: EIILNTT C1 INTITLE +71 281
>Matt: AEEPRSU K11 .UE +7 155
#note I'm pretty much dead now, so it's fish and pray.
>Brian: ?AEEEIR 5A EA.ERIEs +64 345
#note Yep, good game.
>Matt: AEOPRSU 3A AP.EROUS +61 216
>Brian: CFO 1A CO.F +39 384
>Matt: EEMOQSW L11 SMEW +40 256
#note Hoping to draw the other S and capitalize there, but that wasnt going to happen.
>Brian: DIIV 13E .IVID +15 399
>Matt: AEELNOQ G2 Q.E.N +14 270
#note Damage control right now.
>Brian: EGRSY 15H GREYS +41 440
>Matt: AELOOOT 2B O.O +22 292
>Brian: HI H1 HI. +29 469
>Matt: AELOOOT A12 ALO. +21 313
#note Play off 2 O's and draw the last 2.  Fitting for how I butchered the first half of this game.
