>Jim_Burlant: ACENNOO 8F COON +12 12
#note Didn't occur to me to dump the rack, but that's what Quackle says I should do.  Q's preferences are 8D CANOE or NEOCON.  At any rate, this set a very interesting sequence into motion.
>Matt_Canik: APY 9G PYA +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: AAENNTT 7H TANNATE +69 81
#note The only other placement is at 10A for 66.  Despite the board position I felt that it beat the alternative of potentially giving him a 3x3 for 3 fewer scoreboard points.  At about 1000 iterations, these two plays sim identically. Given his next rack, 10A looks an awful lot better.
>Matt_Canik: HITW 8L WITH +55 82
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINSS 10A CASEINS +68 149
#note I saw 8's in this and it took almost 3 or 4 minutes just to find this, such is my ability to see 7's these days. 10B INCASES scores 7 more and wouldn't have given him so much back.  I whiffed on it.
>Matt_Canik: KLPU A7 PLU.K +39 121
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFRST C7 FEA.TERS +82 231
#note Luckbox!  Well, I finally got one right.  It's ither this or C3 FEASTERS, and this is best.  90% to win.
>Matt_Canik: ADERZ D4 RAZED +44 165
>Jim_Burlant: BDENOTV E1 VOTED +26 257
#note Score-wise, any of my options score between 24 - 30 points and from that perspective this is as good as anything else.  Q doesn't like this much, saying I should hold the V and play something at 3D like BOND or BOD.  I saw the B hook on RAZED - I wanted to unload the V.
>Matt_Canik: BIJU 2B BIJ.U +32 197
>Jim_Burlant: BEINOOT B12 BOO +20 277
#note Hated what this did to the board given how promising my leave was, but I  didn'tsee much else. Q also likes F4 BOO for 16, but this is best.
>Matt_Canik: AMR 1A RAM +23 220
>Jim_Burlant: EIMNORT 6N MO +21 298
#note No 8's anywhere.  Between board blindness to 3C and wanting to make sure that something in SH didn't come down at O1, this was my choice.  Quackle doesn't like this at all, docking me nearly 10 (!!) points to 3B OM, but this choice kept this game from getting away from me right here.  
>Matt_Canik: ?FILORU J1 FLUORI.s +70 290
#note Had I noticed 3C on the previous turn, Matt was going to play FLOURIs(H) O1 for 99.  As for this choice - Matt told me post-mortem that he wasn't sure of the front S hook on WITH, so he took the sure bet.  Good thing for him that he did, and you'll see why in a second.  Even with this, Matt is only 30% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRRT 1J .INDER +33 331
#note And had he played at K1 for 10 more points, I'd be coming back with INTRUDER on row 3 for 70 and the game would almost be over.   As for this choice - Q gives slight preference to DRIFTER 1G for 3 more, but in reality any of the row 1 plays - DRIFTER, REFIND, FRIEND, THIS, RIFTED, REDFIN - any of them are as good as any other.  In retrospect this could have been a hair dangerous because of the X.
>Matt_Canik: GHO 3A HOG +31 321
>Jim_Burlant: DGILRTU 3I G.ILT +16 347
#note Normally I'd want to unload the U.  Q likes 4J  OUTRIG, 12B BEDRUG (too risky given the crap that landed in my rack and the fact that some good tiles are still unseen), 4H GLOUT, and 3I GUILD.  But with Q unseen and a board that could get Q-unfriendly in a hurry, I wanted to hold the U. This is a strong choice, but I should have played off the D instead for 2 more points.  55% to win.
>Matt_Canik: IQ 5C Q..I +14 335
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLRSU F10 .U +2 349
#note And now I completely throw the game away.   I felt hamstrung and had no idea what was right here.  If I opened up and landed a bunch of vowels while he had the X, I'd be dead; I was fixated on doing something about BIJOUX/XI  or something like that.  I didn't see BEDRUG, I didn't like 10I LUG because of what it did to the board, and none of my other options scored enough to justify turning the tiles in my mind - especially with all those unseen E's and/or the V in the bag.  So I opted to fish off the U, look for an E or blank (a 5 in 14 shot given the unseen pool) so I could hopefully play LEDGERS on row 10 for the win. One other factor was in play:  time mismanagement on my end.  Because it took way too long to to find CASEINS, and trying to figure out what to do with all the no-go's, I was under 30 seconds.  Best is BEDRUG 12B or E10 IGLU, neither of which I saw.  Those both look a helluva lot better than this.  This play, which essentially amounted to a passed turn, cost me the game.
>Matt_Canik: EEEI 5H EE.IE +10 345
#note Matt slapped this down before I had even seen the tile I drew.  When I saw this come down, I was crestfallen, as I knew I was going to have drawn something nasty.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGLRSY G2 SLY +22 371
#note Now I'm down to 15 or 20 seconds.  I wanted to make sure he couldn't hit me with BIJOUX/XI or something - pretty stupid considering the possbility of NIX F9 that my ill-conceived fish gave him.  Best is apparently F4 GID.  Surprsingly this isn't a bad choice, and it wins 58%.  Given my next draw it wins 0.
>Matt_Canik: AENW 9K WANE +24 369
>Jim_Burlant: DEGRVX 10N DE +19 390
#note Down to three seconds, and I ahdn't even figured out what I would do if the X was in the bag, so I didn't even see the obvous X dumps.  Best is obviously D14 X, but courtesy of my misplaying the late game, it's just a handful of points of spread at this piont.  Tip of the hat to Matt for staying in it and outplaying me late.  I sure didn't deserve this one, given how poorly I played the late game.
