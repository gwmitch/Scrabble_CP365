#note I'm not keeping the Q.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGIRX 9H GEE +21 21
#note Hey, I didn't know EXEDRA. But I like this play for the defense, and keeping the X for another turn.

>Wayne_Clifford: ABN 13G BAN +17 149
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIJTUZ D13 JU. +11 191
#note I took really long here. Decided that I should just dump this and hope to draw ZA 12H or something.
>Wayne_Clifford: OPR E11 PRO +19 168
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEITYZ F10 ZEE +38 229
>Wayne_Clifford: L I6 L... +4 172
#note Close to a bingo are we
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IIINTY 11C YI.. +9 238
#note I can't really stop Wayne so might as well hope to hit something next turn - but I didn't like playing YIN/KIRN since he'd likely hammer it. TYIN makes it harder but I think I like the fishing play here.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEEINRT 5G TRAINEE +69 241
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IILNTU C4 UNTIdIL. +62 300
#note Wow, there's a second bingo that plays to the Y here! I missed the sevens too :<
>Wayne_Clifford: AIQ 8A QA.I +39 280
>Matthew_Larocque: CEHOSVY 4A VO.CH +34 334
#note I kinda like COVEYS for 41, but I didn't think of it.
>Wayne_Clifford: AB 12H BA +16 296
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEIOSY 4K EDDY +29 363
#note Just a blocking play. Sim doesn't even like it that much, but do I really want to test my luck with 4L YOD? That's a good way to blow the game.
>Wayne_Clifford: A 10F .A +11 307
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMNORS 13B MO.. +26 389
#note I actually forgot about the KIR spot, so it's a good thing I had a decent lead. I missed R(H)INOS this turn.
>Wayne_Clifford: EL B13 .EL +10 317
>Matthew_Larocque: FIINORS E3 R.INOS +31 420
#note I see it this turn, but I'm emptying the bag - I don't think he has any outbingos that can catch me, but hey I could be wrong.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?ALMORT 3M OM +23 340
#note This game had 10 As and only 7 Os, as in a previous game. I'm not sure how to remove one of the Os in Quackle, though. Seems like this would be his rack, but then he missed MORTALs.
>Matthew_Larocque: FIOOSST O1 IFS +23 443
#note I only have 1 O, and I should have just played SIFTS or SOFTS N8 here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?ALRT H1 TaLA. +15 355
#note Someone came over after the game and pointed out he missed TRA(V)eL. He could have simply played out for 11 points as well.
>Matthew_Larocque: OOST 6M SOT +10 453
#note Game ended, 455-353.
