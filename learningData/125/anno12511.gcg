#note -How long do you take here, and what do you play?  I took 5 minutes, and decided on JADEITE:  reasoning:  The J seals the topleft of the board.  Even after cheating and looking at a full list of bingoes, I think I still like JADEITE.

#note Phoney.  I know my opopnent is not the type to challenge very often.

>E_Tran: ACHRRST 2J CHA.T +32 187
#note Sim likes H6 CRAB a lot more.  Didn't see it.  Need to abide by my mantra of "think of hooks when a word is played"
>Matt_L: AEEINRT 11C ARENITE +69 130
>E_Tran: NRRRSUZ H11 .URN +5 192
#note Probably a bad time to play riskily against a lower-rated player.  Sim likes RERUN, which makes sense, because RRSZ is a pretty bad leave.

>Matt_L: FOOY --  -30 130
>E_Tran: JLRRSUZ 15F JUS +45 237
#note Sim likes JARL.  It's even stronger than sim suggests, because I know Matt doesn't have an S.  But instead I convinced myself I should go for the sure points.

#note Completely blanked out on CHANTY.  I thought of it after I dumped my Y.  Again, need to follow mantra of thinking of hooks.

#note (T)I(E)R to set up QIS is brilliant.  My play is better bad.

#note 12 in the bag.  Wanted to block the dangerous line.  Should just exchange here though; might fall into a situation where I draw two more consonants, and be helpless.
