#note I saw NAUTILI in post-game. Shouldn't have missed that.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?AEEOPR I3 OPERA.Ed +62 62
#note A lot of better ones. OPERAtE 7G 71 and PAROlEE J2 69 are examples
>Avery_Mojica: AIILMRS 5C RAMILI.S +70 78
#note I was deflated at first to see he had blocked SIMILAR, but then found this. I set this down with nerve, but assured myself it was good. And it is.

#note SHRIVEN doesn't play. VAIN, VAR, and VAN, all played here, are .1 away from each other, going from 56.7 to 56.5 respectively. With 200 iterations, VAIN is the clear winner, gaining a 2-4 point lead over VAN, which comes second, beating VAR by 0.3. It fell behind at times too, but it stayed higher for a majority of the sim.

>Avery_Mojica: ?HIKRRS J2 KHI. +30 182
#note SHIRKeR is cool at B8. KRIS is 2 points better than KHIS, but I didn't know it.

>Avery_Mojica: ?BIRRST 3L BRR +17 199
#note BURRIEST and BURRITOS are the only bingos, but I wouldn't have played them even if I found them. Quackle likes getting rid of the I for a few more points, but not me.
>Matthew_Ridout: EF 6E EF +31 204
>Avery_Mojica: ?AILSST B8 SALTIeS +68 267
#note I didn't know nearly any of the 7s that are found in this rack, and I even debated SALTIES for a while. Then I remembered the top 100 bingo stems, and only 3 aren't actual words. SALTIE is a word, so I figured this would be good. I didn't bother looking for an 8.

#note URBIA is cool. I'm setting myself up for a possible B bingo here, though it sims slightly lower than IF.
>Matthew_Ridout: AH C9 HA +20 316
>Avery_Mojica: ABIINOO 11E BOON +23 358
#note Quackle doesn't like this at all. And I guess I don't either. It was a very quick play, not given much thought. Thank god I didn't do anything else... Why?
>Matthew_Ridout: DEIN H10 ..DINE +27 343
#note Sweet jesus...
>Avery_Mojica: AEIILQU 14E QUI.IELA +71 429
#note It all comes from an examination of a game a while back. It just immediately popped out at me when I drew it, and I was so thankful a Q popped up. He had to challenge, since he hadn't seen it, but lucky me.
>Matthew_Ridout: CDGMNWW -  +0 343
>Avery_Mojica: CDEOT 15L DECO +32 461
#note CODE(D) 12D is the best, and I like it too. 
>Matthew_Ridout: EGGMNWW 13L MEW +22 365
#note Had I played CODED, however, he might use a fun 6... GEWGAW!!!!!!!!! Maybe more fun than PIRAGUAS? 12D placement is better.
