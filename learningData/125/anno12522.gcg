#note After Nigel's last play, I was trying to recall whether SQUIFF was good. There was an annotated Can-Am book that discussed a lost turn regarding this word. It stated something like SQUIFFY being good, but no SQUIFF. I still wasn't sure if I inverted the truth during the game.

>Gunther_Jacobi: EEEEEGS 3L .EE +24 189
#note Only one E had been played up until now. I had a feeling I'd be getting several after the bingo.
>Nigel_Peltier: AH 14A AH +24 158
#note I believe Nigel told me that after AH, he was left with N?. . . . ., hoping for a brutal 8 ending in MAN. A great strategy, since I'm not likely to play just one tile at 15A.

>Nigel_Peltier: OT 2J TO. +5 163
#note This was a clever diversion.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEEGGH 14G EGGHEAD +73 308
#note Since Nigel had been playing a bit obscurely the last few plays, I figured he was close to something mega and didn't feel like playing this at 9K where a 3x3 could occur.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?ANNRST -  +0 163

>Nigel_Peltier: ?ANNRST A8 TRAiN..N +90 253
#note BOOOM! Leaving S for 14N! With JKWV and a healthy amount of vowels could assure a mega-play next turn. Although there is a 149pt 3x3. Do you know it?
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEEOST N10 TOEAS +42 382
#note I absolutely have to refrain from challenging here, even though I was about 50/50 on TRAINMAN. A hypothetical JIVES would be 98pts, enough to take the lead.
>Nigel_Peltier: EIJV 1G JIVE +44 297
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEEINV 9J .IVE +20 402
#note ENDIV(E) K9. I forget this word too often.
>Nigel_Peltier: AW G1 .AW +13 310
#note A nice play setting up his S. The other thing cool about this play is that the K can't hurt him at F2 because my only vowels are E's.
