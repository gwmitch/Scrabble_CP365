#note As soon as Bob played this, I said, "we both wish you had had a U."
>Dave_Koenig: AADOPSY J8 SOYA +28 28
#note Definitely best to burn the S here for points.  Maybe POSADA.
>Bob: FNU K9 FUN +26 50
>Dave_Koenig: AADILPR L10 PAIL +23 51
#note There are a bunch of similar plays here. *shrug* Your guess is as good as mine.

#note There's only one (unplayable) seven with these tiles and no eights.  I spent a while looking, even though a bingo isn't likely to be any better than this play.  EYASeS 14I would be the right play only in duplicate Scrabble.

>Dave_Koenig: ?CNOOPT (challenge) +5 343
#note I thought MALTINGS# was probably good, but I wasn't sure enough to hazard it.  Bob challenged YUPS giving me my third nickel of the game, all of them on words good in TWL.

#note I felt like the most interesting Scrabble player in the world here: "I don't always dump two vowels, but when I do I score 28 points and take away the only place my opponent could have done something."
>Bob: RU 7C UR. +5 276

#note When it rains, it pours.

#note With the way this game went, I'm mildly surprised I didn't have a place for INTERWEB#.
>Bob: EHNORST O1 THRON. +27 327
#note THENS F9 is a surprising 51 points, but Bob can perhaps be forgiven for not spotting it by this point, especially considering John and Marsh had just arrived at the house.
>Dave_Koenig: DGIINT L1 NIDI +16 579
#note I saw the best play DAINT# 10D but again wasn't sure enough to try it.
