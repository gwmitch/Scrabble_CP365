#note DROUK. Duh.
>Eric_Tran: AH J1 AH +26 135
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEKOOR F9 KORA +24 115
#note Didn't know KAROO. And I forgot that KORA had hooks. Not only did I not block his bingo, I gave him a great spot for it.

#note I think I was too concerned with leave and missed MOPED for 32.
>Eric_Tran: AADEILP L4 P.AEDIAL +76 315
#note Ouch. 3 bingos without esses or blanks!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEESUV M9 DEAVE +31 230
#note I decided on this instead of 3C to give me IDS. Sim likes 3C SUAVE. Is the U that big of a problem?
>Eric_Tran: DFNO 14J FOND +27 342
>Matthew_Larocque: BILNSUY 14J ....LY +26 256
#note Wow, why didn't I know FONDU?
>Eric_Tran: BEENOST M1 BONESET +88 430

>Eric_Tran: GIZ 14B ZIG +36 466
>Matthew_Larocque: IIINOST 3E OI +7 284
#note Ugh. If I see NOI(R)S I should probably just play that. I didn't know COMPO. Exchange II is probably better than this play.
>Eric_Tran: CDL C3 C.LD +14 480
>Matthew_Larocque: IINNSTY K1 YIN +17 301
#note I think this was my rack. Either way I definitely had TYIYN for 45 which is another 5 I did not know.
>Eric_Tran: IQ 2F QI +62 542
#note >_<
>Matthew_Larocque: IINSSTU 7B IS +12 313
#note Again, I didn't write this down, but I had an extra S so I tried setting something up futilely.
>Eric_Tran: ?MNRUW A5 UNWaRM +36 578
>Eric_Tran: ?MNRUW --  -36 542
#note Eric gives me a small break. I remembered checking *UNHOT and *UNCOLD, so this had to be bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINSTTU A5 UNTIES +21 334
#note TENUIT(Y). Probably should have saved my S.
>Eric_Tran: ?FMNRUW O11 WoM.N +36 578
>Matthew_Larocque: AT 15A TA +17 351
#note The tile distribution was incorrect - there's an extra A, while an O was missing. This occured in another of my games obviously using the same tile set.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (FORU) +14 365
#note Eric's final score was 576, so he gipped himself 2 points. I went over a bit on time.
