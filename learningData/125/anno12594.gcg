#note Why not TOWAGE or 3C BEGOT? I don't know. I think I missed BEGOT there, but I passed on TOWAGE.

#note I was debating between this, VOX setting up a big play with the J on the triple, and 14I OX setting up the J at 13I. I figured the latter two spots would almost never stay open for me, whereas after JIVE I'll usually have a chance to make a 20-30 point row 3 play if he takes the D hook and still have the X in reserve with a few good spots for it. I'll be in trouble if he bingos and then has multiple hotspots to choose from the following play, but I'd be in trouble no matter what. For what it's worth, Quackle suggests a setup the other way around: I13 JEE. It wouldn't really be fishy looking since I would quite reasonably want to pass on the extra two points at 3B if I didn't have an A, and even if he does sniff it out he probably would be sacrificing a lot to block it if he doesn't have an O or a play starting JI- or JU-. I guess JEE is probably best for the huge potential payoff, but I'm still satisfied with JIVE since it keeps me in the game without needing to make a big gamble on the next turn.

#note I wish I could get those high-scoring DOU racks.
>Bill: AABIOTT B10 BAT +22 299
#note Vowels are getting scarce, hence my decision to keep this leave. I really couldn't come up with any plan of attack here aside from hoarding vowels and hoping to draw an S someday.

#note Despite my horrendous draw, I have a tiny glimmer of hope since the P was the last tile in the bag.
>Bill: GLMNQRS 8G M.N +15 388
#note Blocking STOPES. Nothing wins, but blocking POSIES with QIS (or just QI if I don't want to telegraph that I see another outplay) is better for spread. Truthfully, I was thinking for some insane reason that POSY was spelled POSEY (like Buster or James) and thus I was blocking the only out.
>Steve: EOPSS 13F .PSOS +17 376
>Steve: EOPSS --  -17 359
#note With both of us having a matter of seconds on our clocks, Steve puts down POSIES ftw, then picks it up because, amazingly, he also believes it's spelled POSEY in the singular form. He then tries this despite there being numerous other ways to win without going out.
>Bill: GLQRS 13E Q. +11 399
#note This wins by a point, whereas taking XIS/OPAHS and allowing POSIES (if he wants to try it now) wins by three. I probably should've done that since I did the calculation, but I was paranoid about there being some way to block both Q spots that I wasn't seeing and, again, I had seconds left. Also, he had played IPSOS with one second remaining, so the margins weren't going to be as thin as they look as long as I could avoid going over myself.
>Steve: EOPSS 13H SOP +14 373
#note A rather indifferent play, but at least at this point he's not missing any wins (XIS/OPAHS would lose by one, actually eleven).
>Bill: GLRS G3 ..S +20 419
#note Best (finally).
