>Matthew_Larocque: IJNOTUV F6 JO.N +27 27
#note Missed JUNIO(R), but I have the T hook for next turn. Also noteworthy is UN(RETIReS).

>Noella_Ward: AEGZ B4 GAZE +39 183
#note I'm lucky she couldn't use the the VAUNT hook.
>Matthew_Larocque: AINOORT A8 ORATION +83 142
#note And I'm lucky to draw a bingo for it!

>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEEIS 3I .IECE +18 223
#note Lol, how could I miss A(P)IECE.  It sims about the same without the A tacked on, though. (T)E(N)ACE is pretty cool.
>Noella_Ward: MOT A1 TOM +22 261
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDERS L2 S.ARABED +78 301
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDERS --  -78 223
#note Ugh. So bad. I saw ABRADES and chickened out. And I actually played this thinking it was good. This basically counts as a forfeited game - if I just play ABRADES I have a pretty high chance to win.

>Matthew_Larocque: AABDERS 11F SEABARD +83 306
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDERS --  -83 223
#note I don't know. Since I'm already upset about losing my turn I just make up another stupid word, and chicken out of the valid word. So bad! My lack of studying punishes me sometimes.
>Noella_Ward: FILT D12 FLIT +28 328
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDERS N2 BREAD +34 257
#note This game was actually close until all this nonsense. And for the third time.... I chicken out of playing ABRADES. This is almost as bad as the time I had the rack of AEIKLRT and played *TARLIKE instead of RATLIKE or TALKIER. 
>Noella_Ward: DNOUW O5 WOUND +35 363
>Matthew_Larocque: AAACENS L1 CE.A +22 279
#note I didn't write this rack down completely, but it was probably close to this.

#note Lucky fit.
>Noella_Ward: GUY 11K UG.Y +29 451
#note Yes it sure was.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIRV H8 .VER +6 378
#note I didn't know SIVER, ELVER. I should have played VI(A) but I wasn't trying all that hard here.
>Noella_Ward: EGMO L11 .EM +16 467
