>Matt: ABEGIOS 8F OBI +10 10
#note Uh yeah, AGES probably isn't that great of a leave.  Play long with BOGIE.
>Robert: EITY 9F YETI +21 21
>Matt: AAEEGSS 10D AGE +14 24
#note With 2 S's I don't mind having a wide open board, but SEA scores 21 and keeps an S for next turn.
>Robert: IIW 11C IWI +23 44
>Matt: AAELSSY 12D LEA +22 46
#note Ugh I must have been tired, this is 3 turns in a row I screwed up.  ASYLA scores 34.  At the very least I need to dump the Y.
>Robert: JN G8 ..NJ +18 62
#note Luckily as I putz around he's not running away from me.
>Matt: AEORSSY H11 OYERS +45 91
#note Got a turn right finally.
>Robert: EFO G13 FOE +23 85
#note Somewhere around here he overdrew, and I plucked a blank off his rack, which was a nice momentum swing.
>Matt: AAIKORS F14 KO +36 127
#note Hoped against hope for a U to play through, but there are two other 8's in this rack besides OUAKARIS#, both Collins-only.
>Robert: AGOT I11 TOGA +39 124
#note Nice play.
>Matt: AAHIPRS J3 RAPHIAS +78 205
#note I had to reassure myself of RAPHIAS, and I was really close to playing PARIAHS instead for fewer points.  That would have kept the game in my favor, though I had no way of knowing what would happen next.
>Robert: AEGLNOT 5D GANTLO.E +94 218
#note Gah!  It's so much more likely he'll double-double with an R in 7th position.  You can make the right play and still pay for it, such is Scrabble.
>Matt: HMQSVXZ -HMQV +0 205
#note Oh seriously.  What am I supposed to do here?  I didn't want to give him the Z or X now that I had drawn them both, so I ditched the rest.  
>Robert: AFIN H1 FINA. +27 245
>Matt: ?CMRSXZ E4 Z.X +19 224
#note At least I have the blank now, so as much as I'd like to score with the Z and X, I have to think about bingoing instead.
>Robert: DDU 3J .UDD +12 257
>Matt: ?BCLMRS 7H CL.MBeRS +69 293
#note Still would like a vowel someday, but at least I can bingo.
>Robert: PRU O7 .PUR +18 275
>Matt: CLMNOTV 11L VOLT +14 307
#note Where are the stupid vowels?  This was Game 10 all over again.  MVULE preserves a vowel, but there are so many to draw that I'm OK with turning over an extra tile for 2 more instead.
>Robert: DIV M10 V.ID +16 291
>Matt: ACEMNQT 2G Q.N +12 319
#note This is where I lost the game.  I had tracked that I had the case A, so I thought I could take a turn to dump the Q and hit back with CAZ# next turn.  If I take CAZ now, he's unlikely to take away my Q spot next turn, and he can't score, forcing a fish.
>Robert: AEH 4C HA.E +40 331
#note Couldn't believe it when this came down.  I knew I was sunk, although I still had a prayer left.
>Matt: ACDEMTT 3B ACT +28 347
#note MALTED is 39; didn't even look down there, but unless I block the F he bingoes next turn anyway.  With the last T on my rack this isn't a bad shot, he has to use the blank as an F, P or T in order to bingo down this column.
>Robert: ?ENORSU A3 tONSURE +76 407
#note Ballgame.  Lots of bingoes from the F score more, but they lose to my RETIMED comeback, so this is right.  
>Matt: DEEIMRT 2B ME +24 371
#note TREED B6 first, then MI in this spot.  Didn't deserve to win this game, that's for sure.
>Robert: EEINUW L1 WI.E +24 431
>Matt: DEIRT 1K T.IER +24 395
>Robert: ENU 13K NU.E +5 436
>Robert:  (D) +4 440
#note Scored as 440-385 because I misadded after CLIMBeRS.  I need to double and triple check my math with all the time I normally have left in my game.  Disappointing to blow this game, but at 10-4 with good spread I was still in the top 5 and in contention, all I can ask for.
