#note I guess I was foolish for thinking Siri would actually let me play this. :/ If I had remembered REALGARS things would be easier.

#note He follows up with a phony of his own! If I had thought about this a little harder I might have challenged. His valid bingo is COLLEEN.

#note SERIOUSLY. There's lucky, and then there's this. A perfect storm of unlikely fortune. Don't get me wrong, I was beyond happy to save some face here. But Siri got robbed. I friggin phonied 2 turns in a row! And phonied a third time after that. Unthinkable. Suffice to say I won the comeback prize.
