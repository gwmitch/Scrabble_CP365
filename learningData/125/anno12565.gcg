#note This was interesting. With three Is, I am much less likely to double up on them (in fact, I only have a 29% chance). I still didn't know if I should hold it, though. A 10000-iteration sim says holding IS is about .5 points above holding AS or S.

#note Given that I just played small, it *might* be appropriate to block that S. But after his next play, I think he probably sat on the blan kafter this, so maybe not.

>Matt_Canik: AEEIORS 11A OE +6 35
#note Sim prefers OE G2 to ROA(D)IES for 32. I played hit here to try and keep open as many 8s lines as I could, but Quackle says that's wrong.
