>George_Asaka: AFFG 8G GAFF +22 22
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADISSU J8 .ID +11 11
#note I didn't realize I had spent about 6 minutes debating on what to do. And after all that thinking, there ends up being only 2 bingos, SArDIUS and (G)UISArDS. And I got so tired I couldn't even remember if FUD was good. Sheesh.
>George_Asaka: QZ -QZ +0 22
>Avery_Mojica: ?AOSSTU K10 OUT +9 20
#note And then I spent another 5 minutes debating over OUTPASS. And of course it was good. I didn't like the look of much else, so I figured I'd try to hold off and get another bingo worth more. This is starting terribly.
>George_Asaka: ?ACILNO H8 .NALOgIC +80 102
#note Haha - the usual bingo in a game with George that I hadn't heard of. But I've never seen him play a phony bingo, so I didn't even hold. Nice find.
>Avery_Mojica: ?ABSSTY G10 BAY +19 39
#note BABYS(I)TS is the only bingo. Not found. None of my plays so far have made it into the sim. I'm so good.
>George_Asaka: IJ G6 JI. +12 114
#note Here's where he starts dumping a lot.
>Avery_Mojica: ?BEISST K2 BISTrES +78 117
#note aSBESTI(C) for 86 lol and BESTIRS L8 for 82. I learned this one by observing other games on cross-tables. Thanks, Dave Wiegand.
>George_Asaka: ENZ 14F ZE.N +33 147
>Avery_Mojica: AEMNOPU 2K .UMP +20 137
#note Trust me, I do better later. PNEUMA is the best (15A)
>George_Asaka: OX 1N OX +31 178
>Avery_Mojica: AAEGNOO 4H GOO.E +16 153
#note At least it made it on... It's 4th
>George_Asaka: EG 11E EG.. +10 188
#note Trying to set up an R maybe?
>Avery_Mojica: AAADENR D10 AREA +14 167
#note 15E AA stays at the top after 500 iterations. But I would think in a tournament you should block the place. 
>George_Asaka: ASW 3G SAW +23 211
>Avery_Mojica: ADEHLNT 2B HANTLED +83 250
#note Phony. He didn't even hold, so I guess we both got mixed up maybe? 
>George_Asaka: COY 1A COY +34 245
>Avery_Mojica: ALPRUUV C13 PUL +18 268
#note I didn't like the places that UVULA was available for whatever reason
>George_Asaka: R C1 ..R +12 257
#note There's the R
>Avery_Mojica: AEINRUV 4A VINE +29 297
#note I felt compelled to block off any hooks on YAR.
>George_Asaka: I M2 .I +8 265
>Avery_Mojica: AINORTU A4 .IRTU +24 321
#note Another 500 iterations sets VIRTU slightly below VIATOR. I wanted to keep a decent rack, and I'm glad I chose this. A(DAG)IO is cool though.
>George_Asaka: E 10J ..E +4 269
#note Chose this over VIRTUE and 4 others. Thank goodness he did.
>Avery_Mojica: ADMNOOR M7 DOORMAN +81 402
#note MADRONO is 4 better, but this is an easier find. MAROON(E)D is the only other bingo at E5.
>George_Asaka: E 8M .E +2 271
#note This confirms he has the S.
>Avery_Mojica: AEEIQRV N6 VE. +17 419
#note VE(L)AR and VI(L)ER are the winners from another 500 iterations, but I wanted to block off as many ways to get points as possible. And considering he's going to try to build over there, I can still play QI 7F.
>George_Asaka: W 12K .W. +12 283
>Avery_Mojica: AEHIQRT 7F Q. +11 430
#note And now I can do that before it's too late.
>George_Asaka: EIKLRST O8 STRIKE +54 337
#note I knew there wasn't a bingo left, so I felt better. 
>Avery_Mojica: ADEHIRT 15A HI.T +24 454
#note HELD is better, but so is HALED and HALID.
>George_Asaka: LN 12G ..N +6 343
>Avery_Mojica: ADER 15H .ARED +12 466
#note ARCED here is better. CARED is second.
>Avery_Mojica:  (L) +2 468
