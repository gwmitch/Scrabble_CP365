>Matt: BCDEIIN 8D BINDI +22 22
#note A weird rack, what do you play to open?  Something like BI to go for an early bingo? CEBID for maximal points?  I went for points + DWS defense with BINDI, which is 3rd behind BI and CEBID in a 2-ply sim.
>Emanuel: AFLO 9B LOAF +17 17
>Matt: CELNORT E5 CON..ER +48 70
#note I was happy to find this play, a clear winner.
>Emanuel: OY F6 YO. +29 46
>Matt: AGGGLOT 7H GLOGG +12 82
#note Oh that was an unfortunate draw.  Let's start over.  TEGG and LOGGAT# (which I didn't know as a singular) beat my play in the sim.
>Emanuel: DEV 10D D.V +21 67
#note It seemed like he was very close to a bingo for this first half of the game, but it didn't materialize for him.
>Matt: AAAOPTW 6I AWA +32 114
#note More triplicate, but at least I can score this time.
>Emanuel: MM 5K MM +24 91
>Matt: AAOPSTV 4L AVO +20 134
#note AVO because I have the S but not the L.  
>Emanuel: EO 8J OE +15 106
>Matt: AHIOPST B2 HOSPITA. +80 214
#note This takes a non-trivial back hook in CSW.
>Emanuel: IQ A6 QI +24 130
>Matt: ENOSTTU O4 STOUTEN +92 306
#note He challenged both words, probably because the game was getting away from him fast.
>Emanuel: AW C2 AW +25 155
#note That's 6 2-tile plays in a row, but he has to go for volatility.
>Matt: EHRSTTU 1C SHUTTER +98 404
#note And I'm a giant bongoing luckbox.
>Emanuel: AEELNRR 2H RELEARN +72 227
>Matt: ABCDEIR 1L BEAD +41 445
#note I draw into a 4th bingo but it's unplayable. With the Z and J out it's right to take this spot instead of A1.  
>Emanuel: KY N6 KY +40 267
>Matt: CIILRRX 3I XI +37 482
>Emanuel: ADP A1 PAD +31 298
>Matt: CIILNRR A6 ..N +42 524
#note Man, I may have a shot at 600!
>Emanuel: TZ J6 ...TZ +37 335
#note Nice play to score with the Z.  Scored as 40.
>Matt: CIILRRU 10L RUI. +6 530
#note IURE is better than this since it doesn't set up a minor J hot spot.  RIZ scores 12 and is the duck's choice, this is 3rd.
>Emanuel: U M1 ..U. +14 349
>Matt: ?CEIILR A1 ...I +11 541
#note I did miss something that would have given me 600: sLUICIER#.  I forget if the word occurred to me, but I wouldn't have been confident enough to play it given that I could make a fish and try again next turn.
>Emanuel: ?EEEINS 12D ESErINE +77 426
>Matt: ?CEEILR H10 CE.LER +24 565
#note I spent about 7 or 8 minutes looking or something, but Quackle reassures me that nothing plays.  However, I can J stick him by playing at G3.  
>Emanuel: FJ 6D J.. +13 439
>Matt: ?I I9 Io +18 583
#note So close to my first tournament 600.  Final score recorded as 591-442.
>Matt:  (F) +8 591
