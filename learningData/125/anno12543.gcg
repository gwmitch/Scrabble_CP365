#note Best.  Not thrilled about keepng the V, but with the blank it's not too bad.  Surely I can get some vowels and bingo soon, right?
>Pat_Barrett: ACEF 7G FACE +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ?AKMNVV J4 MAV.N +18 62
#note Don't know if I agree with Quackle here.  Q wants me to exchange KVV.  Yes, KV? absolutely sucks as a leave.  But I have a hard time turning down 4 tiles turned and 18 points if I have the blank.   That said, if I was going to play through, KNAVE J3 might have been a little better.  I couldn't think of it.
>Pat_Barrett: DEIMPR 4G PRI.MED +30 57
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDHKLV H1 CHi.K +39 101
#note Thought long and hard about this.  Valuing the blank at 27 - 28 points, and given that a bingo prone leave wasn't possible with all this crap, I felt that if it came to 4 tiles turned and 39 points scored vs. playing for single digits or exchanging, I should just take the 39 and play through.  Quackle disagrees with me, saying I should play VELD L3 for 8.  Seriously?
>Pat_Barrett: DEESU K7 SUEDE +24 81
>Jim_Burlant: BDELORV 12H BOLDER +32 133
#note I saw 6 tiles turned, 32 pionts, and I'd deal with the V later.  Q prefers 12K DROVE slotting the E in the O column; it says the more dangerous board position is offset by the BL synergy and my unloading the V.  Not sure I agree.  
>Pat_Barrett: ADEO H11 A.ODE +24 105
>Jim_Burlant: EHIRTUV 14B THRIVE. +44 177
#note Finally, a choice Quackle agrees with.  Any of the rack groomers (9G UH, M10 VIRTU, etc.) give up way too much on the scoreboard.  
>Pat_Barrett: ANW 9E NAW +29 134
>Jim_Burlant: GGTTUXY I11 G.X +39 216
#note Yikes!  When the leave is this cruddy, if you've got big points available, take 'em.  The only decent rack cleaner available is 1H CUTTY for 14, and the GGX leave is hardly worth giving up the 25 scorebaord points to this.  79% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: GITTUYY 1H .UTTY +14 230
#note I saw this and took it both for the defense and turnover since a good leave was not salvageable.  Quackle agrees with me - this is best.  It also turns out that it was the right play at the right time - Pat was about to put down NEOTENI(C), which this blocked.
>Pat_Barrett: EEINNOT B12 NE. +3 172
#note This is Pat's actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIRYZ 12A I.BY +20 250
#note  Prior to Pat's last play, I was planning on playing BERRY D11; I didn't like 3L BIZ (Quackle's preferred play) because it struck me as reckless and I was still saddled with the Y.  Now that she's opened up the triple to give me a distraction, I need to block.  While some bingos are still possible down the O column, this does give some resistance and it outscores her 20-3 on this turn, adding 17 points to my current margin.  I'd make this play again.
>Pat_Barrett: EILNOT C10 LO. +5 177
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIIRZ M9 ZAI.E +48 298
#note Best - not only does it score huge points but it defends quite well, too.

>Pat_Barrett: EGINT 10M .G +7 184
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGIRRU O8 GUAR +19 317
#note There are no 7's in this rack and the only 8's (SUGARIER, ARGUFIER) don't play.  It's either this or O8 URARI.
