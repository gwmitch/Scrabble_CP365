>Matthew_Larocque: CEEOSVV 8E COVE +18 18
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IRZ F7 Z.RI +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: EEKNSTV H4 KEEV. +17 35
#note Maybe I should take the points here, especially since it also takes an L hook. KEEV(E) does well in the sim though.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BDEIL 11C BIELD +30 45
#note I didn't know this, my fives are obviously pretty bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACMNOST C8 COM.AT +26 61
#note STOC(K)MAN is the bingo. If I had seen it I might have taken a stab since I didn't really know the word. Since I wasn't sure on BIELD I didn't play SCANT. CANTS 12B is 39 too, though!
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EHNOS H11 SHONE +45 90
#note Now I'm getting punished for not knowing my fives.
>Matthew_Larocque: AINPSSU 14C SNIP +25 86
#note Dunno. I didn't wanna play something like PUS or UPS here opening the TWS. but I also didn't wanna keep the U. Maybe SUP 9H?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEYY 12H .AYEY +28 118
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGRSTU 9H DUG +20 106
#note Juraj held KEEVE so I thought I'd be able to get away with this - setting up my other S.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: QT 12B Q.T +28 146
>Matthew_Larocque: AERSTTU 15D UT +8 114
#note There's a bunch of As left so I guess TAU 13k or UTA 15D are better.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ANN 13G N.NA +14 160
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEORST 4G O.A +7 121
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AIINOP 15H .PINAOI +10 170
#note PIANO is a lot of points.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABERST 3A ABATERS +73 194
#note I forgot the anagram for this word.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EGORU A3 .ERUGO +24 194
#note He used up an awful lot of time here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DILOTU 3I TOLUIDe +69 263
#note This play really messed Juraj up in a strange way. He had thought I played TOLUIDs for the rest of the game (I did write down E, though).
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EFW 2H FEW +33 227
>Matthew_Larocque: FLMNOST 1G LOFT +49 312
#note That was lucky.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AX 4D AX +31 258
>Matthew_Larocque: AIJMNSW 14M JAW +39 351
#note I didn't want to keep that blank E open, but strangely I never thought of plays like AN(e)W or SM(e)W.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DR 6G R.D +4 262
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIIMNS O1 SE.MING +36 387
#note I saw my bingo and I was only like 50/50, so I decided not to risk anything. Juraj gave me the funniest look because he thought I had just played through an S.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?EEHILR L5 cHEERIL. +64 326
#note His only bingo.
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (IR) +4 330
#note He went way over on time, I think looking for 3x3 plays.
