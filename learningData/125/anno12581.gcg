#note I wanted to score and keep some of the rack together. But I missed the word that does it: 9G IGLU. Damn. It also gives nothing back. Big error.

#note 8A VIM was the obvious equity play, but I couldn't figure out how I was going to win after that. Even if I pull a big Z play at L1, I am still way behind. Can I really afford to block the bingo lines and stick a V at 8A? That was my logic, anyways. I knew Quackle would hate it. I dunno. I think The S is too important to burn. It's going to be the key tile it whatever bingo line I end up setting up for myself. A play on the J column, probably. But I just really hated VIM. Not like ZITS actually accomplishes anything, though. Probably the play is just VIM.
