#note This was a hard decision. I figured JAB, JIB, and JILTS would all be close on speedy, and speedy puts JILTS 0.4 above JIB, which is 0.8 above JAB. JAB/JIB puts me down 23, and JILTS puts me down 12. Both are kind of significant on a closed board like this. I have the 5 and G lines for bingoing, and potentially others if he opens me up. I probably should have just taken the 12 point deficit, but then I feel it's kind of a race to the blanks. With a nice leave, a bingo could put me up enough to give me a good chance at the win? After 5000 iterations quackle likes JILTS best by about 5 points, then JAB. I suppose JILTS is best.

>Jackson_Smylie: ??CIPTV C11 PITC. +24 372
#note Very surprising to see the blanks, especially since he was shuffling his tiles in a bingoey way. Suddenly the bag looks like crap, so a play like PIT kind of shuts down my options. Does PITCH sim poorly because I should be drawing fewer tiles from this bad pool?

>Jackson_Smylie: ??EGNUV D3 .rEVUiNG +74 446
#note I feel (P)rEVUiNG wins 35/36 times. I looked at the pool, the only way I saw that I could lose is if he hits DYNAMIS(T). I have to pull NQ from the bag, which is a (2/9)(1/8) or 1/36 chance. 35/36 times I will win. That's a good chance at winning, right? Right? Right?
