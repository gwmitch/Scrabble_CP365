>Avery_Mojica: DEKNSVY 8G DYKE +24 24
#note VENDS and ENVY are the best. I didn't think so.
>John_Merlau: ?ADLOTU J4 OUTL.ADs +64 64
#note DYKED is good, for OUTLEAD, OUTLAND, and OUTLAID. 
>Avery_Mojica: EELNPSV 4E ENVEL.PS +78 102
>John_Merlau: AEFHPSU 3C HUP +20 84
#note Best: EPHA 5C, FU(N) F2, FEH 5C. I think he knew I would take advantage of the open double resulting from K11 placement, so this was safer in a way. Then agian, this does leave the double open at E5. I don't know.
>Avery_Mojica: EJLOSYZ 5B JOLE +32 134
#note Well hot damn. JOYLE(s)S 11E is 64. JOEYS 5A, JOYS 5B sim 2nd and 3rd. I played this over H1 placement because he has many ways to play at this location for a lot of points, whereas it's not easy to score 36+ off of H1. If I took that, it would only be one point more, and leave him with row 5 for a potential big play.
>John_Merlau: AAEFGMS H1 FAM. +27 111
#note 2B FAME or FAMES are the best. It's a nice fit.
>Avery_Mojica: AEORSYZ 2F ZO. +32 166
#note Yes, OYEZ fits at two spots. I think it opens up too much. I have a steady lead, and I can take 30+ with this play with ZOA, while keeping a pretty nice lead. Also, I keep the board closed.
>John_Merlau: ABEGIIS 7F GIB +18 129
#note Only GABIE(s) is better, by 0.1. Upon simulation, GIB comes out the clear winner. (250 iterations)
>Avery_Mojica: AAERSWY 11J .WAY +18 184
#note I didn't even look at WHUP. And 6E RAYA for 35 is quite a beautiful fit. I might have just played that for the sheer beauty, but YAW for the leave. I was so focused on leaving AERS that I just took the first opportunity I saw.
>John_Merlau: ADEIIIS C5 .IDIA +9 138
#note AIDE or AID at K6 are the best, but using the E is a logical winner.
>Avery_Mojica: AAEEIRS I8 .AE +14 198
#note I took about 5 minutes here, but I'm surprised I found the best play.
>John_Merlau: EGIINOS 12K OI +13 151
#note Best
>Avery_Mojica: AEFIORS D7 OF +21 219
#note FERIA D8 is best, but I wouldn't have played it.
>John_Merlau: EGINRST N9 RESTING +80 231
>Avery_Mojica: AAEINRS 3H .A +8 227
#note This was one of the most thought-based plays I have had in a while. I have a tendency to be able to find triple-triples, especially against John. This isn't an ideal rack at the moment, but with a leave like ARSINE, I figured I leave myself row 15 and Column O for available bingos, and he won't be able to block both. I've studied at least this far up in 7s at this point in time, so I know there's no A that can combine with ARSINE to form a 7, so I'm just hoping to fish off one, let him take one triple, hope it isn't worth too much, and take the other. There is one bingo available, can you find it? (Next play will tell) - And amazingly, this play sims 6th quickly, but with an actual simulation, MA slightly beats out 10M AE. I think Quackle wants me to block off the triples, but I'm not going to do that with the plan.
>John_Merlau: ?EHLNOR B9 LEgHORN +74 305
#note The bingo I had was ANTISERA, 6H.
>Avery_Mojica: AEINRSU 15A A.EURINS +131 358
#note If you don't know me well enough, I have little patience to study 7s. I study 8s way more, and they seem to come easily. I found ANERUINS at 14H quickly, but didn't see anything else, and the U deflated me, since there isn't a 7. This bingo gave me a chance to catch up, and it won me the game right after this. Thank you, Zyzzyva.
>John_Merlau: AEEENST O7 TEE +11 316
#note TEE doesn't even show up close to anything else.
>Avery_Mojica: CDIQRTW 14F QI +64 422
#note Seeing QWCD as the first four letters turned over, my hopes were lost of winning, remembering Omaha. Then I saw an I. Then I saw 14F. Then 
>John_Merlau: AEINNRS 15K REI.N +21 337
#note He saw INSNARE post-game. A(g)INNERS 11A and L2 IN(S)NARES are also available for bingos.
>Avery_Mojica: CDGMRTW 13J CWM +24 446
#note What a cute little play
>John_Merlau: ABCNRSV A7 CRAB +31 368
#note 13A V(O)CAB is best.
>Avery_Mojica: ADGIRTU 12A T.UD +18 464
#note Not very good. I didn't see THUG.
>John_Merlau: EINOSTV E10 VEST +23 391
#note Lots of plays come close. The flashiest possible play of the game goes to (V)IV(ID)EST for 16 at G4!
>Avery_Mojica: AGORTX 2B GOX +36 500
>John_Merlau: INO L1 ION. +5 396
#note He kind of gave up at this point, he said. I pointed out the best plays, but he also said he wasn't sure of FINO or FOIN. Ah well.
