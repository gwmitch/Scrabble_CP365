>Mark: FLUX H6 FLUX +28 28
>Matt: HINSSTW I8 HIST +23 23
#note Setting up my 2nd S. WHIFT# gets rid of more of the junk, wasn't sure of it.
>Mark: IIII -IIII +0 28
>Matt: ANNOSSW 12I SNOW +22 45
#note ST# is a hook I still have trouble seeing; SWANS scores 38 at H11.  Still focused on setting my S, but this is not very good defense.
>Mark: DEJLO 11K JOLED +49 77
#note Or JODEL#.  Ouch.
>Matt: AAGNRSU O7 GUAR. +21 66
#note No I or A to play through (didn't know RUNANGAS#) makes this an awkward rack.  This was an attempt to draw an I for (GUARD)IANS next turn.  GARUDA# is a nice option as well.
>Mark: ABEL O7 .....ABLE +42 119
>Mark: FIT (challenge) +5 124
#note Drew the challenge from me since it seemed phoney-like, it is Collins-only.  There are 8 TWL 4 letter back extensions of GUARD, and an additional 5 in CSW.  
>Matt: ?AAEINS N1 AmNESIA +69 135
#note Thought I may have missed something, but this and ENtASIA are the only bingoes.  Even though this is very volatile, I have to bingo and hope for the best I think.  
>Mark: FIT 1L FI.T +33 157
#note Well that could have been a lot worse, I'll take it.
>Matt: DNNOOOU M3 ONO +14 149
#note I am a NOOB# for missing the 13L play.  
>Mark: EGIU 6H .UGIE +13 170
>Matt: DELNORU 11B ROUNDLE. +68 217
#note Not going to play ROUNDLE# at 2F for one more, with the Q still out.
>Mark: AIMPR 14J PRIMA. +32 202
>Matt: ?EHPSTY 15D TYPHoSE +99 316
#note I was all set to play the newly-learned PHYTOSEs# when he gave me this lane.  He thought that PHYTOSE* was also good, but that's TYPHOID/PHYTOID, only TYPHOSE.  Also of note, TYPHUSES, PHYSETER#/HYPESTER#.  
>Mark: AQY D10 Q.AY +32 234
>Matt: ACENRTW L3 WAN. +29 345
#note TAWER keeping CEN is intriguing, since I have the R to play through in column B.
>Mark: ADIIIVV 13B IV. +18 252
>Matt: BCDEIRT A13 TIC +25 370
#note This wasn't an intentional setup, but it worked out as such.
>Mark: MO K4 MO. +24 276
>Matt: BDDEERV B10 B.E.D +34 404
>Matt: ADEEKRV (challenge) +5 409
#note BREID#, past tense of BREI#, South African, to pronounce an R sound at the back of the throat.  Not to be confused with BRAAI#, which is South African for "to grill".  Got a challenge and a "nice play" from Mark. Quackle actually likes this better than VERBID for the same number of points (without the +5), even though VERBID shuts down column A effectively and ditches the V.  Knowing what happened, I'd probably play VERBID.
>Mark: IORT A7 TRIO +16 292
>Matt: ADEEKRV M7 VAR +22 431
#note DEKR > DEEK apparently.  The intention here was to prevent a 50 point Z play.  So of course I would draw it next turn.
>Mark: E G14 E. +5 297
>Matt: DEEEKNZ B6 ZEE +36 467
#note The only bingo that can play in column B is EROTICA; blocking the D also protects against ERGATOID#.  My play is greedy for points but gives him a couple more racks that will hit an out-bingo.
>Mark: ACGIORT C3 ARGOTIC +96 393
#note Like that.  Ouch.  He thought he didn't have anything, then he kept moving ARGOTIC down column C until it fit.  At least it didn't cost me the game.  He went over on time, so final score was 467-403.
>Mark:  (DEEKN) +20 413
