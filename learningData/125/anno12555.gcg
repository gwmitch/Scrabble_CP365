#note I guess I was too hasty to get rid of the G, since I can keep the N with it.  YEARD#/DERAY/DEARY for 3 more.
>Andrew: AORV 2L ARVO +19 122
>Matt: DDEELOU O1 D.ODLE +30 190
#note Ugly leave, but he could be setting something up here.  He did have the J as it turned out.
>Andrew: DIJ 4D JI.D +24 146
>Matt: DEEENRU 3H ENDURE +29 219
#note Had I known I wuld only draw one vowel and 2 blanks the rest of this game, I probably USED.  But in a normal case this looks right.
>Andrew: AGIMO N5 AMIGO +26 172
>Matt: CEMNPVY A1 E.PY +39 258
#note Quackle suggests VAMPY, which gets rid of most of the dreck.  I thought I could continue to put on the pressure by scoring and survive the bad leave.  
>Andrew: IKR O8 IRK +32 204
#note This plays at 4J for 41, but the play works out for him.
>Matt: ?ACMNVW M9 VAW +23 281
#note This puts me at around 92% to win, but just wait and see what I draw.
>Andrew: AEEHIST 12H ATHEISE +82 286
#note How does he have 4 vowels on his rack?  Now I'm worried.
>Matt: ?CFMNQS -FMQ +0 281
#note I don't trade enough here.  I should get rid of the C as well, and maybe even the N, because I need vowels, desperately.
>Andrew: ETW 4K TEW +34 320
>Matt: ?CGNSTT H11 T.NGS +18 299
#note Again, probably too eager to get rid of the G.  TACTS is the play.
>Andrew: FIST O12 SIFT +36 356
#note Man did this game get away from me fast.
>Matt: ??BCMRT K11 B.RM +16 315
#note Now I'm getting frustrated.  Quackle thinks this is best, but with no vowels to play through I need to draw some or I'm sunk.
>Andrew: HO I14 OH +13 369
#note Rightly blocking the S, since it's obvious from my last 3 plays that I don't have vowels, but probably a blank.
>Matt: ??CFPQT 7M Q. +21 336
#note You've got to be kidding me.  Look at what's left in the pool, and I draw the last 3 counters.  I could not believe that those vowels dodged me for so long.
>Andrew: AE G13 AE +10 379
>Matt: ??CFNPT 6B PaCT..N +16 352
#note CoNF keeping PT? is best.  I am glad this game didn't happen during my losing streak, or I may have lost it on my poor, genial opponent, who did nothing wrong.
>Andrew: EIILLU 15H ..IEL +18 397
#note Best, along with UILLE(AN)# and ILLI(T)E.
