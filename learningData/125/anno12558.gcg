#note It has been a while, but I think this was his rack.  He spent several minutes trying to find something before playing this, and after the game I didn't see anything either.  Now as I type in the rack LIMULOID popped out at me immediately.  That's tough to find during a game.
>Matt: AGIIPTV 6B VIGIA +24 94
#note Maybe VIG?  VIG is vulnerable to overlaps of GIN (something like QAT), and the leaves look pretty comparable to me, especially since all those I's are gone already.  I guess when in doubt take the points.
>Chris: OQRU G7 ..QUOR +25 48
>Matt: AENNPTX 5C PAX +49 143
#note It takes a lot for me to keep duplicate N's anymore, but 49 points will do the trick.
>Chris: CCEE H12 ECCE +30 78
>Matt: BEENNTT 9I BENT +22 165
#note Didn't draw the K for KENNETT#, though it didn't play anyway.  It'd be nice to have that O hook, but I think this is OK.
>Chris: FLOO F11 LOOF +20 98
>Matt: EENNSST M3 SENNETS +76 241
#note Lucky draw there.
>Chris: DEY N4 DEY +33 131
>Matt: AAABIOV L4 BAA +31 272
#note BATAVIA#, a variety of lettuce, that's crazy.  This is less than idea comparably, but probably best of the words I know, especially since it kills that (NY)E/S hook.
>Chris: W D4 W.. +14 145
>Matt: AGIIKOV C3 GO..K +39 311
#note The leave is ugly, but he needs 2 bingoes to catch up at this point with this play.
>Chris: ?AELMRT 15H .REMiTAL +77 222
>Matt: AEIIJOV O1 JIVE +53 364
#note Yeah, I drew pretty much everything this game.
>Chris: AGH 14J HAG +34 256
>Matt: ?AAIOSU 8L A.UA +18 382
#note Balances the rack, plus he can't bingo the L anymore, forcing him to open for me with the blank.
>Chris: INR 5J IN...R +27 283
>Matt: ?DEIORS 11D cO..RISED +95 477
#note I debated about DOLORISEd*, then remembered that I could put that D at the end of the word and use my blank at the front.  Definitely my favorite play of the tournament, since it was a 9 that required a special fit.  It's no WATERZOOI but I'm happy with it.  Oh, and why is this not one of our -ISES?  WTF OWL.  
>Chris: FNOT 12K FONT +25 308
>Matt: AHRUWYZ 14N ZA +46 523
#note Yeah that's just not fair.
