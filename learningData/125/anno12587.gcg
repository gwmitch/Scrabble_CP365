>Matthew_Larocque: EGIIOSY 8G YOGI +16 16
#note I actually had doubt if YOGI was a word! But then I assumed it had to be because I only knew YOGIN from the N hook.
>Wayne_Clifford: CEIT K5 ETIC +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEILOS 9B OLEInES +66 82
#note This is actually the highest scoring bingo, but it didn't seem like it at the time. OILSEEd in the same spot sims a hair better though. The 59 point zEOLI(T)ES is up there too.
>Wayne_Clifford: EKY 8A KYE +37 60
>Matthew_Larocque: HINRTWZ L4 WHIN +29 111
>Wayne_Clifford: AM 10A AM +24 84
>Matthew_Larocque: GIORTXZ J7 Z.TI +27 138
#note This is stupid. I thought it might be worth it to set up (ZIN)G, but he's likely to just play ZINE next turn.
>Wayne_Clifford: DEP M6 PED +26 110
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGOORX A10 .GORAE +24 162
#note Meh, I didn't want to play OXO M2. I can do better, and it gives him too many potential points.
>Wayne_Clifford: CO 8M .OC +18 128
>Matthew_Larocque: FLOPTTX J2 FLOP +25 187
#note Still gonna wait to see if I draw an E for a good X play at AGORAE. For some reason this got added as 35.
>Wayne_Clifford: AHO M2 HAO +17 145
>Matthew_Larocque: BLNRTTX N7 B.LT +24 211
#note That was a life saver.
>Wayne_Clifford: DESSW B12 DEWS +33 178
>Matthew_Larocque: EINRSTX D3 INTERS.X +94 305
#note Sweet!
>Wayne_Clifford: EEJ -  +0 178
#note Bonus!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADDENO N1 DADO +31 336
#note I quickly dismissed (RE)DONAtED, but I missed (RE)ADOrNED!
>Wayne_Clifford: EEJ C11 JEE +30 208
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGINO 11E AGONIsE +91 427
#note Too lucky.
>Wayne_Clifford: MU 12K MU +12 220
>Matthew_Larocque: ABERRUV C3 BEAR +26 453
#note Wow, there's a bingo here. I was just trying to close things off. Counted as 28.
>Wayne_Clifford: ANV 7F VAN +17 237
>Matthew_Larocque: IRRTUUV 13J RUT +10 463
#note This looks like an awful play, and I didn't know what else to do at the time. I think I chickened out of VIRTU thinking maybe it was just VERTU. :/
>Wayne_Clifford: FT 6B F..T +15 252
>Matthew_Larocque: AIIRRUV 3G VIR. +12 475
#note Terrible. Low time kind of forced me to slap something down without thinking.
>Wayne_Clifford: ALNQSU H1 QU.N +42 294
>Matthew_Larocque: AIRU F11 .UAR +7 482
#note (N)AIRU.
>Wayne_Clifford: ALNS 5F ALS +17 311
>Matthew_Larocque: I 1H .I +11 493
>Matthew_Larocque:  (N) +2 495
#note I lost some time points but also *overadded so my score was 487.
