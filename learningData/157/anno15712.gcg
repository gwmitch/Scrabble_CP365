>Joshua_Sokol: AABGSTV -ABGV +0 0
#note (Matthew provided me with his racks) 
I considered AVGAS, but I didn't like it, nor did I like GAB/BAG or VAT/TAV.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADIORSU H6 UDO +8 8
#note I guess that's fine. :P

>Joshua_Sokol: DGILOSW J7 WOG +14 112
#note GOWD G6. Missed it.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EIIJSTU 10F JUTES +40 109
>Joshua_Sokol: DDGIILS G9 G.ILD +11 123

>Matthew_O'Connor: EELNOOU -  +0 161
#note Challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKNSVW O11 SWINK +63 246

>Matthew_O'Connor: EELNOOU -  +0 161
#note Challenged again.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEOTV 4H V..EO +26 272

#note (C)OULEE.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELRTTX 13C TAXE. +28 300
#note Man this was bad. 13J TEXT, E3 EXTRA, K3 T(E)XT or even 5C T(E)XT, a lot of options here. (VIDEO)TEX is a new one.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AIILLNU 12A ILIA +16 191
#note INULI(N) maybe. This is good.
>Joshua_Sokol: BELPRTT A10 TR.PLE +24 324

>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGPST O1 PoTAGE +31 386
#note I mistracked. I thought he had an E therefore CHERRY/BY. I didn't have much time left, since I spent it all looking for bingos... There surprisingly weren't any. I lost 30 points in the endgame because of that...
>Matthew_O'Connor: CFHMRRY 5K FRY +30 320
#note M(E)RCY, R(E)FRY and M(E)RRY at K3 missed. MYC 5K is better too.

#note I would have had a hard time winning if it weren't for the two challenges I won.
