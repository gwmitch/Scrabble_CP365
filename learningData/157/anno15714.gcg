#note I didn't know UPSTAGED. If I did AI(KI)DO would be a given. Instead I did something I didn't need to do, which is play an intentional phony. It also didn't work out.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINRS 14C SARDINE +74 397
#note Here is where I really screw up. I was hoping she didn't have a bingo on her rack, that by some miracle she didn't draw well after her two last plays. I laid down ARSENID(E) and then had second thoughts about its validity. But I had a lot of time and if I wrote down ADEEINRS I would have figured out NEARSIDE/ARSENIDE. I also was debating playing RANDIES 14D, but I saw an M in the bag and chickened out. So I chickened out on two plays that seem obviously superior to SARDINE 14C.
