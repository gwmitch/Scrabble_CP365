#note I wanted to play KEG but I wasn't trying to give him the S hook. Paranoid, I know, I have the blank, but still. And not sure why I didn't play GAED...

#note Real rack. He said I blocked unhaired, which was part of why I played anoa and not OKA or TAKA.

#note Usually when I exchange, quackle hates it. Here all it wants me to do is exchange. AGUE scores 12 rather than 0, the IIU could be ok considering I have the Q to work with, and it makes it way harder for him to bingo.

#note I got lucky this game. Both blanks early, made mistakes in GEAR, DOL, and possibly ANOA. On that last one I just didn't want to hold multiple A's I think, but I gave up lots of points to make that play as well as being lucky in blocking his double double.
