#note I was pretty happy he played this, and also pretty lucky.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEHLWY K4 CHEWY +51 51
>Wayne_Barclay: BG 6J B.G +12 42
>Joshua_Sokol: DELORUU J8 .UDU +13 64
#note 4H DOUCEUR looks better.
>Wayne_Barclay: EESZ M3 ZEES +33 75
#note Cool, seems his rack is broken.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILNOR K10 ONE +13 77
#note I think EON 9F is too dangerous.4K CEE  looks decent.
>Wayne_Barclay: NRU I10 URN +10 85
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILORV 12B OVERLaI. +72 149
#note Seems to give back less than any of the RELIEVO/RILIEVO plays (that I didn't see). 
>Wayne_Barclay: CENR B10 CR.NE +26 111
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFOTTT A13 OFT +25 174
#note I liked how that part of the board was then sealed.
>Wayne_Barclay: DIIV E10 VI.ID +18 129
#note It seemed at the time that Wayne was kind of driving himself into a very closed board, which I was happy about. All of the spots I had to worry about were mostly gone.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIITT -TIAIA +0 174
#note I really dislike 10A ACTIVE here. It gives me a lot to worry about. It would be a good play if Wayne played it though. I guess I should just score with VET C12. The sim doesn't really show much difference between the plays. I did this so I could hope for tiles to score with or to bingo with if he opens something, which I thought he would inevitably need to do at some point.
>Wayne_Barclay: MOT 9F TOM +20 149
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEMOT C12 .OTE +26 200
#note Oops, VOE. I guess I spaced out this turn. I also meant to set myself up with FETED or FETID while Wayne devised a plan to open the board up for himself, but if he had EX there I would have been smoked. Bad mistake here.
>Wayne_Barclay: EH L11 EH +24 173
#note I guess he missed the spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEMNP D14 EM +23 223
#note OK, I'm in a great position now that I got the blank. I still didn't think it was correct to open the board. N2 PAM is winning the sim unless I infer an S, in which case my play is slightly ahead. I think I really need to infer an S in any case.
>Wayne_Barclay: ABENSS N1 BEANS +29 202
#note OK, he probably has another S after this play. Such commences the opening ceremony.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAINOP 1M A.O +15 238
#note 4D PArANOIC! Bad miss. I can't block the ESS spot really, so I opted to block the scoring spot.
>Wayne_Barclay: AY 5I YA. +13 215
#note I really shouldn't be afraid that he'll bingo with the opening this gives him, but I am.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AFIINP H4 FAN +20 258
#note I think I should play 13G IF here. I'm hoping he doesn't have one starting in S.
>Wayne_Barclay: AEORSTW G3 WO +14 229
#note Sim says go for points with 10E VOW. I inferred ST and then AISTE and then AREST, and VOW is ahead each time. Good setup though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?GIIILP 10E .IG +24 282
#note Paid the price for keeping too many I's.
>Wayne_Barclay: AAEIRST 2F ATRESIA +67 296
#note Winning the sim, close with ASTERIA.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIILP H11 P.LEI +28 310
>Wayne_Barclay: AQT 1D QAT +24 320
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DIIOPT 1H OP +22 332
#note 14H EPIDOTIC. I don't think I knew it, but damn... That's two almost automatic winners I missed. Sim likes 2B POI over my play.
>Wayne_Barclay: ADI D1 .AID +28 348
#note Wayne said he regretted this play as it left him vowelless.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADIIRT C3 AID +15 347
#note I had a lot of time left and I used it all up looking for something. This game is a really prime example of how badly I played in Ottawa, as I missed 3 bingos and also a game-changing play I should have noticed from the very start, (JUNKY)ARDs. This wins, but just barely.
>Wayne_Barclay: GLLRSX 3M ..X +19 367
#note I didn't even see that.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IRT O5 sTIR +11 358
#note I wasn't 500% sure of PRUNER, even though I should have been.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (GLLRS) +12 370
