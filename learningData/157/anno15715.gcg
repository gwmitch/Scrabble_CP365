>Jackson_Smylie: BIJ 8G JIB +24 24
#note Last game of the tourney, me and Jackson didn't really care anymore so we decided to set up a table away from the rest of the action to coffeehouse. It didn't really go as he planned, though :(
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHIKNT J7 rETHINK +84 84
#note Wasn't sure of bETHINK.
>Jackson_Smylie: EGHI 12H HI.GE +26 50
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEFRRY K3 FRAYER +39 123

#note EP(H)EBI, cool.

#note Told Jackson challenging was a bad idea, but he wouldn't listen. :(
>Joshua_Sokol: ENOSTTU 5B TENUTOS +68 292

>Jackson_Smylie: ILT H1 LIT.. +15 100
#note Damn, I was skeptical but not sure if it was bad or not. Phony number 2. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEEVY N9 AY +26 318
#note I was kind of scared of the X-bomb, but this was not a very effective block if he were to have it.
>Jackson_Smylie: OW 8N WO +24 124
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEESVW 4A WADE +33 351

>Joshua_Sokol: AACCEMM 14F MA.C +14 435
#note I had never had this rack before, it was pretty cool. Many play surpass this, but I think I just didn't want him to do a word ending in ZER.

#note ME(DE)VAC!
>Jackson_Smylie: AELR 3K .LEAR +25 213

>Joshua_Sokol: CEILM 12A CLIME +44 503
#note Forgot to record my racks since I was having so much fun. I wanted him to 3x3.
