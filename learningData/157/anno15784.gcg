#note keeping EIR over ER is rarely correct, AER is a more reasonable keep but IR has a little bit of anti-synergy. I liked it because there were some consonants to bingo through but either HIREE or keep ER are better.

#note missed eyre at e8, definitely better since it limits damage at row 12

#note well, that was unfortunate...I didn't like a fishier play like AI at 6I because of the limited number of lanes on the board. Peter tends to play very aggressively but I think he would certainly try to limit that spot. 75% bingo chances seem too small. playing UNAI or just AI may also be better - I liked preventing a play on column J that would potentially kill all of my lanes in one fell swoop.

#note blocking all of my lanes seems like huge trouble, but I am down a ton and need some points. I'll take a shot at some 9s down the road for the extra points.
