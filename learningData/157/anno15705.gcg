>Joshua_Sokol: ADENRTU H6 UNRATED +70 70
#note Don't think it was worth trying to figure out what was best here. UNTREAD gives an ING hook and an S hook, but this gives him an A next to DLS. DAUNTER gives both and NATURED gives twice as much as UNRATED.
>Deen_Hergott: IX I9 XI +36 36
#note Then again this happened.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEMWYZ G8 AW +28 98
#note I could go with static's J6 ZYME here, but even though it gives me ZA, that's unlikely to work out very well for me with what I draw. It does score a ton... What AW does is that it almost certainly gives me (WAX)Y/MAZY or MAZE(D) 12D next turn. I also considered MAZE(D) setting up AMAZED, but that's not as safe of a setup.
>Deen_Hergott: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 36
#note Exchanged 5.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEMOUYZ J6 MAZY +41 139
#note OYEZ J8. Oops. the Z at J11 probably isn't a huge deal, especially compared to at J8. Maybe I could have played YUM/MAR and given up my setup or MAZE(D) leaving WAXY for next turn.
>Deen_Hergott: GORT K4 TROG +17 53
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEIORU L7 OUREBI +22 161
#note Cool, a spot.
>Deen_Hergott: DLOTT 11C DOTTL. +14 67
>Joshua_Sokol: EHILLOQ 10B QI +34 195
>Deen_Hergott: EIJ 11J JI.E +26 93
>Joshua_Sokol: EHLLOST N6 HELLOS +33 228
#note If I'm going to play something with JIBES I might as well play HOSTEL, even though it's dangerous. I hadn't really thought this through. I thought it was unlikely for him to have a bingo ending in O or A so it would be difficult for him to use the hotspot I opened up, but I completely disregarded the fact that he could play down starting at O1.
>Deen_Hergott: ACLO O5 COLA +31 124
#note I could have lost my lead here, but he didn't get a lucky 5 tile draw. He took a long time here, so I guess it worked out. I don't think he would ever not use this hotspot unless he had a bingo elsewhere.
>Joshua_Sokol: BCDFNTV -BCDFNV +0 228
#note I considered keeping two consonants or just a C, but I didn't want to draw 4 consonants and only one vowel. I had a bad feeling. I kept T since there were a lot of N's left.
>Deen_Hergott: EIPY 4H PIE.Y +26 150
>Joshua_Sokol: DNPRSTV K10 D.PT +14 242
#note Damn. He's within striking distance and I got a bad draw. I didn't like V(I)D as it opened A(VID) and I wanted to stop him from scoring a lot with an OUREBIS bingo, so I think I made the right play.
>Deen_Hergott: ?AEIINR E4 RAINIEs. +64 214
#note Meh.
>Joshua_Sokol: CNORSUV 8D V.C.. +14 256
#note VO(E) 9C gave back too much with AVID imo. I liked sealing the board up. and blocking the biggest hotspot.
>Deen_Hergott: AKU 3G AUK +28 242
#note Great strategic play, as it forks the board pretty well.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNORSU 2I SURGEON +77 333
#note Cool, I got a decent draw. That's my fourth this game after turns one and 2, and I guess drawing HLLOST was decent after OUREBI. 
>Deen_Hergott: OO G11 .OO +7 249
#note Deen told me he was frustrated that he had to make this play (so he thought) since he didn't draw 3 good tiles after AUK. It kind of makes it hard for me to block him though.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADFIVW 1M AWA +31 364
#note So I didn't know VAWA(R)D. If I did, playing AWA(R)D would be a sick setup. I would be pretty scared to play VAWARD by itself though, considering the pool and his fishing. This was a hard play to make, but I think that scoring was good, as I didn't know that I could successfully block. I considered FAVA 2D setting up points, but I thought that that could backfire as it opens another lane up for a possible second bingo on Deen's part, since I don't think that would effectively block him, as LOO has all the hooks he needs to bingo. I also considered AV(O) E13 to block if he didn't have anything on lane 2. This is an interesting position to debate.
>Deen_Hergott: BET C9 B..ET +22 271
#note This seemed a weird play to me, but maybe he had both S's, S? or SS?. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEFIMV 12A VI.D +30 394
#note I like keeping E's for (LOOS)E after he bingos :P This play is winning a 4-play sim.
>Deen_Hergott: AEINRSS 14A ARSINES +81 352
#note Well that's pretty fortunate. No blank, even!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEFHMN 15F FEME +37 431
#note So I didn't see anything that effectively blocked his outplays and gave me points or an out next turn. Turns out D4 EF gives me 6 more points in the endgame.
