#note Took me awhile to come up with this (the only playable bingo)
>Chris_G: BILNOSU H1 NUBILOS. +83 107
>Kolton_K: ACEGSUW -GUW +0 65
#note 4B WAGE(R) is clever, setting up SWAGER. I didn't know GAWC(Y) or GAUC(Y), which also sim pretty well.
>Chris_G: EEJ 4C JEE. +22 129
>Kolton_K: AACEENS 9C AE +8 73
#note Q says if you're going to fish off AE, do it at 5C. A(J)EE is better too

#note Oops AMS is phony

#note AEFG isn't the best leave, but I'm just trying to outrun him at this point (and this blocks a good lane)
>Chris_G: AEHLU O1 LEHUA +41 365
#note There is a TWL word in there! (and this blocks my VEHM in the same spot, which I justed learned the game before)
>Kolton_K: AEFGHMV 9K V.G +14 468
#note Not many vowels left, so had to dump some of these clunkers. I also saw that there was 2 D's left and decided fishing for BRIDGEHEAD was totally worth it.
>Chris_G: IN I11 .IN +4 369
#note Chris said he drew the blank AFTER this play
>Kolton_K: ADDEFHM 15A ......HEAD +54 522
#note Holy crap I drew both the Ds
>Chris_G: ?AIORST O8 .AITOuRS +83 452
#note I challenged this (+10) and Chris went over on time (-10) so the final score is right.
