#note With the Q still out with 14 in the bag, I wasn't burning the last U. I wasn't sure about this play at all. Quackle likes L7 EX best but with 3 D's out I didn't want to give him the easy overlap, but apparently I didn't consider that no I's remained. Damn. Horrible play...(-10)

#note Championship took forever to do this. (BLINI)S wins 34% of the time, then (YAY)S 32%, then mine, 28%. I knew the QAD(I) was more than likely to happen but I didn't see anything that I could really so with my tiles to stop it, without giving up too many points and keeping a leave that will allow me to go out first. Even if he plays QAD(I) I can more than likely go out first, considering what his other tiles will shape up to be.

#note Championship player found the win! I looked for a while, almost ran out of time in fact. I looked for cute set-ups, but didn't think of (D)O(W)ER/dowel, which sets up legs or regs as an unstoppable out.

#note I played pretty damn awful this game. Despite bad plays like EX BLURRY and YO, I still had an endgame win that I didn't find. Hopefully I can develop better creativity by learning from situations like this.
