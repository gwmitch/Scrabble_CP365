#note Quackle prefers A(C)ID 1L for 7 more points, which I can see, but H1 has the potential to give up big points.

#note Great letters with no place to play. I took a shot opening it with OD, but Quackle suggests LO at 13F.

>Eric: ?EILORS 15H cOILERS +76 356
#note Leaving the TLS above the I turned out to be my downfall. I liked leaving the C to shut off any bingos, as I figured that was my biggest threat. LOrRies does the best job of killing the hotspot at J14 and minimizing hooks. Even so, the difference isn't huge. Quackle gives LORrIES a 74.22% chance to win, with cOILERS at 71.68%. I thought I'd won at this point.
>opp: OTW M7 TOW +26 340
>Eric: GMNNNVZ J1 Z.G +13 369
#note SERIOUSLY? THIS is what I draw? If I had even one vowel, I think I could've cruised. I really wanted to kill the hotspot, but I was afraid I'd get stuck with the Z. In hindsight, I should have played M(I) for 10 points (win % at 64.09%) without fearing the Z stick because with so many vowels out, he wouldn't be thinking that he could catch me with it. Z(I)G still wins just over 57% of the time.

#note Aaaahhhh crap. 
>Eric: EMNNNOV 13F MOVE +18 387
#note Somehow I still had a shot until I played MOVE. Quackle says both (M)O(L) at G6 and (I)NN at H8 win 62.5% of the time. I see how INN helps, but not so much MOL. It certainly didn't help that I screwed up tracking (this was the only game that I didn't get it right).

#note We had miscounted a play somewhere and had the final score of 403-398. It's frustrating to lose by that little when I can point to a rack like GMNNNVZ. With 11 of 23 unseen tiles being vowels, that's a crazy draw. 1/300? But of course a lot of vowels were on his rack, and I still had the odds leaning in my favor. A good post-bingo rack wins it easily, but I needed to play a better endgame than I did.
