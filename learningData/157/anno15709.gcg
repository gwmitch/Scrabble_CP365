>Stefan_Rau: IQUZ H6 QUIZ +44 44
#note First game against in my opinion the toughest player in the division. This opening is not what I had hoped for...
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGIIIT 9H .ITI +14 14
#note I don't know, maybe exchanging was better. It's just that I had no idea what he left since QUIZ is best with an ENS leave as well as with a UIO leave. I was hoping it was something closer to the latter.
>Stefan_Rau: CDDNSVW K8 W.ND +16 60
#note This is his actual leave.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEEGIN L4 BINGE +24 38
#note I wasn't sure of BEIGNE but I completely missed BEIGE. I also whiffed on BEGIN I3.
>Stefan_Rau: CDEEISV M8 DEVICES +85 145
#note Yes, he drew EEI. :(
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIKNN M3 KINE +24 62
#note Difficult choice to make here. KANE is obviously better than KINE, due to the sheer volume of As in the pool compared to Is. I also considered AKENE M2. KINE's logic was keeping a possible A(T)E word down J.
>Stefan_Rau: AB K5 BA +21 166
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEENY 10K .A.Y +18 80
#note I didn't feel like playing extremely volatile here was a good idea, but maybe N1 YEAN was correct.
>Stefan_Rau: MU J6 MU +22 188
#note I'm happy he had to close up his own hotspot opening.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEINO 4K O.. +10 90
#note OBIA maybe, same spot. Both imply an S I didn't have.
>Stefan_Rau: IJLST 3G JILTS +27 215
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEINO G3 .OE +10 100
#note Another O, great.
>Stefan_Rau: ADEPRST 12E PETARDS +70 285
#note Good game...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEFIN H1 NA.F +42 142
#note I didn't see a bingo here, but I think NAIF is a better play anyway.
>Stefan_Rau: EIMNRRV F6 RIVERM.N +67 352
#note I wonder if Stefan knew this was bad (Collins only). I sure didn't. Good play...
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEILNO 11D DO. +20 162
#note Here's where I start fucking up bigtime. I missed the easy INDOLEs, and (N)ONIDEaL and (N)INEfOLD 1H, LIONISED or INCLOSED 14H, and BLONDINE through the N. I saw INDOLENT and chickened out. Really terrible.
>Stefan_Rau: ALT N2 LAT +18 370
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGILNO D4 LEGIONe. +70 232
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGILNO --  -70 162
#note I played this way too quickly (I've made this same mistake before) and realized what I had done after hitting the clock. Terrible yet again. I even saw ELOINING through the N. LONGwI(S)E 14G is the best score.
>Stefan_Rau: AHLOS O4 SHOAL +35 405
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGILNO D4 eLOIGNE. +72 234
#note Take 2.
>Stefan_Rau: EF 1N FE +22 427
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEOTU -AEOU +0 234
#note Pool seemed consonant-heavy enough.
>Stefan_Rau: X 7C X. +17 444
>Joshua_Sokol: AACEHTT 14J CHA.TE +34 268
>Stefan_Rau: RU 8B RU. +13 457
#note Pretty gutsy...
>Joshua_Sokol: AOORTUY A5 YURTA +39 307
>Stefan_Rau: ?AEOPRW O12 WE.P +39 496
#note WEAPO(N)Ry 1C.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGOO B3 GOO +9 316
>Stefan_Rau: ?AOR E2 tORA +11 507
#note His time ran out. E3 pROA or lOR(DOM)A are better.
>Stefan_Rau:  (E) +2 509
