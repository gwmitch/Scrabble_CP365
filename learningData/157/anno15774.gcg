>John_Merlau: AAIIL 8D AALII +12 12
>Avery_Mojica: EIIKMPP F6 KI.IM +27 27
#note Debated between KEMP 7E and KILIM, sim likes KILIM by a pretty good margin.
>John_Merlau: BH E7 B.H +17 29
>Avery_Mojica: EINOPPT D8 .PPOINT +30 57
#note Do you see the bingo he blocked? I'm embracing volatility, though sim likes G5 PINITE which I didn't know, and G7 TIPI which I did consider.
>John_Merlau: BEV 12C V.BE +9 38
>Avery_Mojica: EHMSSUU 13F HUMUSES +69 126
#note I got so excited once I saw this word that I just slapped it down. Obviously plays on the I column are better. Scored as 70.
>John_Merlau: IJN J10 JIN. +27 65
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADELLW L8 DWELL. +24 150
#note DEWFALLS, WADMEL, WEALDS. - decided to pass up ALLOWED 7H.
>John_Merlau: CERST 15A CREST +37 102
>Avery_Mojica: ?AAIRUY 6F .AURY +20 170
#note RUFIYAA!!! That would have made this game a lot different. Sim thinks this is just as good as anything else.
>John_Merlau: AGRV J2 GRAV. +16 118
>Avery_Mojica: ?AAEEIR 8J RE.IAE +21 191
#note I would have thought this would sim higher than H12 AMIE, but I was wrong. AMIE is significantly better. I'm still at over 90% to win though.
>John_Merlau: OW H13 .OW +24 142
>Avery_Mojica: ?AEFILO 3H AE.oFOIL +72 263
#note Which bingo do you play here? I thought this one would draw a challenge more often than the others, though the A position might decrease its value.
>John_Merlau: ACT O1 TA.C +27 169
>Avery_Mojica: DDENNOR 4C DRONED +25 288
#note omg DONNERD and DENDRON, and I chickened out of REDONNED.
>John_Merlau: AIQ C2 QA.I +28 197
>Avery_Mojica: AENOOYZ N6 ZO. +32 320
#note Championship player doesn't include this in their choices, but does include 4L AY. Can someone explain this to me? I'm not good with these types of situations - ZOA comes in as a higher win percentage (which is what I was going for, blocking off the E and making it harder to hit), but the leave decreases its value.
>John_Merlau: DEGGRTU B5 TRUGGED +66 263
#note Well, this isn't a word. Can you find the real bingo in it (not playable)? It wasn't going to matter much though.
>Avery_Mojica: AENNOTY O7 N.OTENY +13 333
#note words are fun! It blocks off the board well too, and the odds of him having a bingo in the pool are close to 0.
>John_Merlau: ?EFOSTX A10 FOX +29 292
#note 4J AXES is best.
>Avery_Mojica: AENO N11 AEON +17 350
#note Final score 357-292.
>Avery_Mojica:  (EST?) +6 356
