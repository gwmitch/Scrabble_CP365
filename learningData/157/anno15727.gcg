#note So he's scoring a lot, I'm hoping this means he isn't keeping an amazing leave.

>Ross_Brown: ENP N1 PEN +22 118
#note I guess we both assumed it was good. It should be... :P
>Joshua_Sokol: BOOORSU 15G .URO +12 201
#note OK, I think I obviously have to block the 3x3.
>Ross_Brown: ADEINRT 14I ANTIRED +76 194
#note Well, I guess it was a good thing I blocked. It's surprising he didn't have a blank or an S, as I have played 25 tiles to his 11, and I haven't drawn one of the six goodies. This means he's in a better position than I am after this play and he shouldn't be. 
>Joshua_Sokol: BGMOOSV O12 BO.S +30 231
#note What an awful draw...
>Ross_Brown: ?FHY 6G F.sHY +56 250
#note OK, so either he has no vowels or he has the other blank... At least he doesn't have an S.
>Joshua_Sokol: GGMNOTV F10 MO. +25 256
#note I think my only option now is to score. 
>Ross_Brown: ?AGNSTV O3 STAViNG +86 336
#note You have got to be kidding me...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGGNTV E7 VEGAN +29 285
#note I can't completely seal off the board now can I? 
>Ross_Brown: AX N9 AX +28 364
>Joshua_Sokol: AGOOOST 8A TOGA. +21 306
#note I need to open the board, don't I?
>Ross_Brown: BILNO C8 .OBLIN +20 384
>Joshua_Sokol: DIMOOST 2L O.. +6 312
#note I think if I do anything other than open something up I will have no chance of winning, considering Ross will probably block everything next turn. I have to hope he has crap, of course, or else he'll outscore. I don't know, that seems to be my only shot. If he hits the triple I open, he gives me another lane.

#note Wow...
>Joshua_Sokol: DIIMOST M9 MO +25 337
>Ross_Brown: AQT B12 QAT +37 478
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIOST A5 TOI. +4 341
#note I didn't track correctly and I didn't think that he would actually have an out bingo. Holy mackerel.
>Ross_Brown: ADEILRU 2B UREDIAL +72 550
>Ross_Brown:  (DEIS) +10 560
#note I just feel like I had no shot there, that I made the right plays in the beginning of the game just to get luckboxed like no other. I played more than twice as many tiles as Ross and didn't draw an S or a blank before he did. He was rewarded for ANTIRED with 2 blanks and I was rewarded with stuff I couldn't work with for the rest of the game.
