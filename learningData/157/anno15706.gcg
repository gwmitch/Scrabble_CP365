#note I really should have done the math.  Yes, E5 scores more and is the top play on Quackle, but there are more options for him to hit the TWS.  IVORY is much less on the DWS than TWS for him.  45 vs 22 pts  I've had Guy hold a few words but he's never really challenged.  I figure that he knows that I know a few words.
