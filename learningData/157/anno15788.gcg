>Morris_Greenberg: AIINNOU 9G UNAI +18 18
>Jack_Norman: ?AGINUW 7H WAUlING +68 88
#note WAUkING also
>Morris_Greenberg: HIINOTU N2 OUTIN. +18 36
#note I was not 100% on THOUIN(G), I liked it better though. This is still a more volatile play than I'd prefer, maybe THIO(N)IN instead?
>Jack_Norman: AGIIOOW O1 OW +20 108
#note I'm not coming out of this turn with a nice leave without exchanging. I'm happy with this play though because it scores best and takes out the 1 row. Champ player likes it best.
>Morris_Greenberg: FHILPRS 10I IF +28 64
#note This kind of sucked. I think I just missed going the other way with the F completely. FLIP in the same spot is definitely an improvement, RIFL(I)P L3 wins the sim.
>Jack_Norman: AEGIIIO K4 AIO.I +8 116
#note Q thinks i should exchange. Makes sense because of how much aioli gives back.
>Morris_Greenberg: GHILPRS L1 PRIG +26 90
>Jack_Norman: AEEGILV J2 VELA +21 137
#note I like VELA, though maybe VIGA or VEG in the same is what i was going for.
>Morris_Greenberg: HLNOSTY 11J STONY +22 112
#note bleh, whiffed on SYNTH and SONLY, those would have definitely been better. I was choosing between STONY and Y(I)N L6, Y(I)N is slightly preferred (32.1% v. 31.8%).
>Jack_Norman: EGINOYZ M9 ZI.GY +56 193
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BEHLLT 10L L.B +26 138
#note BLiTHEL(Y).
>Jack_Norman: AEEINOV 12L O.EE +26 219
>Morris_Greenberg: ?EHKLRT 7C KHET +18 156
#note I didn't notice (WON)K at the time but that's a pretty cool play. Opens a good bingo lane, and keeps a nice leave. WONK wins 22%, Quackle likes (E)LK O12 second but I am not going to be that ballsy with 3 s's unseen. KHET is among the next group, winning about 16%.
>Jack_Norman: ADDINSV E2 INVAD. +20 239
#note I like VID(E) E4 better for defense and for leave, though invade does allow for two extra tile pulls for the blank.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?DELRST 2A LaRD.EST +70 226
#note SToL(I)DER, I have almost at this point pulled myself out of some equity blunders at the beginning, but I'm still winning only 25% with this.
>Jack_Norman: CCDERST 5B CEC. +8 247
#note This was a bad play. I should hold on to the E playing C(A)D or if i'm going to play the E, C(R)ED C1 is nice.
>Morris_Greenberg: EELPRRS 1F PEER +30 256
>Jack_Norman: DDFJRST C4 J.R. +15 262
#note Also not really a good play though I did block TEAM. Exchanging and keeping RST is appealing because there are 4 E's and 5A's. D(I)F L6 for 23 is also good. From what I can remember, my reasoning for JERK was that 1) I have an S already and 2) There are 4 A's (to hit KA) and only 1 S (to his JERKS) remaining
>Morris_Greenberg: AELMRST 8A MASE +43 299
>Morris_Greenberg: AELMRST --  -43 256
#note And just when I have a chance to get back in it, my worst mistake of the game, I realize the second he says hold that MESA is the word with an M, not MASE. Kudos to Jack for being confident in his word knowledge.
>Jack_Norman: ADDFNST 8A FAS +34 296
#note Fortunately i drew a vowel so I could use/block this spot. I got really lucky that Morris made a (rare) mistake.
>Morris_Greenberg: AELMRST O12 .LM +5 261
#note This wins the sim handedly, 54.48% on 2552 iterations on many. (LOO)M is second at 47.79%. Lucky to have a situation that wins over half the time considering earlier mistakes.
>Jack_Norman: ADDEENT N14 ED +14 310
#note Q likes AD a little bit more.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEHQRST 5M Q. +11 272
#note This is definitely one of my toughest positions during the tournament. My logic behind this was that even if he blocks the high point lane, most likely, he will open up an easy bingo lane to do so, and I'd win. If I take the points now with a 54 point play like THREA(D)S or HATRE(D)S, Jack will be down by 5, knowing the tiles on my rack, including the Q. If I pull the U, there's a chance I'd still be fine in that sort of a situation, but otherwise, I think things look bleak. 48 point play work similarly except it leaves one in the bag so Jack may try to make a play that gives him a second Q dumping spot just in case. Still, it's very winnable for him in those situations. Elise loves HAR(D)S, setting myself up for QAT directly above it if I land an A, with Q(I) being it's second favorite. I am still not sure if I like that better, the likelihood of him blocking that spot with the Q unseen is high and then I am down a few with a forced Q dump play for under 20 and unlikely to go out the following turn. Thoughts?
>Jack_Norman: ADENORT 15H DONATE. +30 340
#note Sharp play by Jack, it wins 80.39% of the time, only losing when I bingo out. It scores, and nicely closes off the ELM spot. In terms of the Q(I) and HAR(D)S debate from last turn, after this choice of his, I win 3/5 times with Q(I) and 0/5 with HAR(D)S, assuming I know the bingoes (I knew 2 of them).
>Morris_Greenberg: AEHMRST 14I HAM +23 295
#note RAMET 14G is the best, 10 points better than this. At this point, I was out of it and ready to take a break and have a fresh start the following day.
>Jack_Norman: ABERU A1 B.UE +21 361
>Morris_Greenberg: ERST 13G SERT +16 311
>Morris_Greenberg: ERST --  -16 295
#note yuk, whatever, I lost at this point. I made a fair amount of mistakes in the game, although (E)LM made things interesting. Jack played a much better game than me, well deserved win.
>Jack_Norman: AR 13H AR +10 371
