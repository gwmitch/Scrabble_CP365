>Seth: NORT I9 TORN +14 25
>Matt: EGIIIRS 12D RESIG. +24 56

>Seth: IPU 1F PIU +19 301
#note phew
>Matt: CEHHIKL N10 HECKL. +46 297
#note Another best move, this puts me within a few points and if he doesn't have a bingo I can outrun him.
>Seth: AIOT O7 IOTA +17 318
#note I get incredibly lucky and he doesn't have a bingo.
>Matt: EHINSTX M3 XIS +33 330

#note He missed it.
>Matt: EHNT 13B THEN +18 348
