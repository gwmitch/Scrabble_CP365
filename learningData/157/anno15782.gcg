#note fid here makes a lot of sense - set up qat where it's unlikely to get blocked, and much more defensive than qaid (by 10 points). these plays are hard. interesting how QADI sims better than QAID because it makes column J harder to overlap.
>Peter: AEIIIOR 9E AIO.I +7 83
#note thanks to peter for trying to remember his racks
>JD: EFJMTUV 4H F.UVE +30 57
#note missed fumet.

>JD: AEJMOTY 10B JOEY +35 92
#note saw moody but passed it up because I'm down 100 and AEJT will block me for at least another turn, but I should be able to score well next turn after moody - maybe 5E or JET 8A
>Peter: EILLNST 12A SILENTL. +74 236
>JD: ?ADHMOT C1 fATHOM.D +76 168
#note being able to get back into the game after a lucky draw is the advantage of dumping the J last turn, as opposed to having to play through the J first.

>JD: ABEIOTU 6B A.U +21 189
#note trying to extend the game by not playing obviate.
>Peter: AAEILNN 8A LA.E +33 287
#note he had to blow up his rack to make this play, he told me later.

>JD: AEEIRST L7 SERIATE +71 323
#note back in it! I'm still definitely not a favorite, but I liked SERIATE at L7 here because the M4 opening seemed to give back the one huge spot at N10-N14, whereas at L7 I could probably respond to his overlap with another overlap. But I think quackle is right that I'm just giving him too many cheap points - M4 wins the sim by a point
>Peter: ACDEMNR M10 DRAM +29 354
>JD: BCHIPRU K11 BURP +34 357
#note the moment of truth - could just play BUR, but I thought I needed to flip the extra consonant, especially with a shortage of vowels, and give myself an extra shot at the S or Z. I did not spot BUHR for 5 extra points, but it actually sims far worse - not totally sure if I understand why besides CH synergy. CURB also sims even. Realistically he may have been holding the S, so I bet my win chances are closer to 1/3...but I am fine with not playing BUR.
>Peter: ACEEGKN 2B G.E +19 373
#note smart tempo play here by peter, he actually didn't have the S, but recognized that the G was a bad tile on this board.
>JD: CGHIRTZ 8K ..RTZ +42 399
#note not much else for me to do but take the points and hope I draw the S.
>Peter: ACEKNST 15K STACK +45 418
#note snack allows him to respond for more points if I play WICH or WHIG. still a winning play.
