#note Noah: I played this game without being able to look at the board. I had to play the whole game from memory. Conrad played this game normally, but told me my tiles, his plays and kept score. He also told me tracking when I requested it. How nice of him!
>Conrad: ?MOOUWY F6 WO.MY +29 29
>Noah: DEFKRUY I7 F.UKY +20 84
#note FLUKY or DUSKY? This seemed good.

>Noah: DELOORR H11 OLDER +26 110
#note I think the best play here is a pretty ridiculous one. Good luck finding this in a blind game.

#note Saw TOYON a few turns ago when I didn't have it...not now. Seems better here. I considered the strong play of IN(R)O 15F briefly here, making JI and overlapping the E in REPtILIA, but realized it would be a mistake.
>Conrad: CEEEIRT 3C E..RETIC +24 311
#note Or maybe CIS. 
>Noah: EINNOTU H1 UN.O +15 331
#note I can play UNTIE and keep TOYON!
>Conrad: DEGGLSV 1G V.GG +9 320
>Noah: ACEINRT 1N .E +15 346
#note Missed CIS because I screwed up the board in my head.
>Conrad: BDELSTZ K9 B.Z +32 352
>Noah: ACINRST D8 .ARCIST +18 364
#note Yeah. Screwing up the board made me miss CIS again and I didn't think five tile plays making AJEE would work. Don't know if I'd see TRIAC though.
>Conrad: DELRSTT C2 L.TTER +23 375
#note Not 100% on DREST, which is bessed.
>Noah: AEINO 2F AI. +15 379
#note HEN J10 is best. I was very close to playing ION(REPtILIA) here.
