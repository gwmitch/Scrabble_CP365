#note So the pool is 1/4 vowels at this point. For the rest of the game, vowels looked especially important. So do blanks.

#note As I mentioned there's a big incentive to keep vowels here. This is why I didn't play OCTAD. I thought about both placements of DEV and COVED. Looking at the position now, even with other plays like VOD(KA) available, those look like the 4 plays to consider. Right now playing DEV doesn't make too much sense to me. It keeps an extra vowel but ANT is probably enough to keep and turning over two extra tiles with two blanks and two Hs still out seems far more important. If I do play DEV I should play the other one! COVED G11 looks like the play. I'm not sure quite why I made this play. I think part of it is wanting to somehow be "cute".

#note CARTOP is pretty awesome! I did not know the word. PRONTO seems right here. Turns over 5 and also keeps an A. I didn't think of it. Not sure how good this is...seemed alright and I was running a bit low on time.

#note I thought about LATHY, but it seemed like this would have to be better. Another option is (e)THYL, which I didn't see. I think I prefer eTHYL here. Intuitively, it seems to raise my bingo chances. It also helps me draw the blank, something I will often need to win. ALNT seems poorer than ANT here. I can't quite describe why I think eTHYL is better but it just seems to do a lot of things better to me.
