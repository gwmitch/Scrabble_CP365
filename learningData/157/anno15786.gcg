#note huh, EIRSV might be strong enough that -IR is also a good play. this is almost a crapshoot. what do you do?

>cesar: CHIIORS K1 CHOIR +29 43
#note bad miss. didn't see ISOCHOR, and 7I/I7 HEROIC is also a pretty damn good play. this is kind of ridiculous. (-12)

>cesar: AGIINSW 4G WAI..NG +24 67
#note maybe ICINGS, but WILING looks best here. i don't know what i'm doing sometimes. i didn't like the AIS leave. i don't know. (-2)

#note he had a better spot for this!
>cesar: EFIKOPS 15H K.IFE +39 147
#note seriously if i'd played FINK here this game would be three million times different. a 6-point sacrifice is worth it here, even though it doesn't seem obvious to me. (-1.5)

>cesar: AMOPPST 12H M.OTS +36 183
#note i'm still not that big of a fan of this move. it almost seems like scoring points just for the sake of scoring points. what if i do something like 12L MAP? i like that better.
>roy: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 160
>cesar: ABIPPRT 10L BAP +18 201
#note i don't understand how it's possible that i missed H1 PAPA. i think i was pretty low on time though. this whole tournament i played very slowly. actually i went overtime two minutes this game. (-4.5)
>roy: DENU 5D NUDE +15 175
>cesar: HIIPRRT D2 PRI.T +14 215
#note this is not going according to plan. this is, of course, a bad move. didn't think of BAST/THIR or TRIP, but even HIP there is ok actually. meh. (-5.5)

>cesar: HILNRSU O6 INRUSH +40 255
#note ok, i need to go all out now. if he has the X, he has the X, and maybe i can draw a blank, or vice-versa. surely, he's not going to bingo with both blanks and then draw the X and have two huge spots for it, right? HILAR or HULA are other options that i should have considered more strongly, but i think that they are actually even more volatile as they are going for bingos. this is an interesting play.
>roy: AJ 13G JA. +24 219
>cesar: AFLOTTU H1 TUF. +21 276
#note i suck, i can't find topful, but that is a tricky 6. it only takes another L. i think it becomes more important the later in the game it is to find the perfect right play. TOPFUL gives me two more shots at the X. TORULA does the same thing more crappily but is also better than TUFA. this is a deserved -14 back as turnover is extremely important right now.
>roy: ??DEENT C6 ENTEreD +60 279
>cesar: AELOORT 8A LO.TO +18 294
#note i actually still have an ok win chance if i can draw the stupid X!! or maybe a bingo. i like B2 OATER but it doesn't give me bingo lanes. LOOP 2A looks good but LOTTO gives me another shot at the X. what to do here?
