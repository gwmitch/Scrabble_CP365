>Joshua_Sokol: EEEGGRX H8 EGG +10 10
#note I wasn't certain EGGER was valid, although I don't think it's necessarily better than EGG.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: FHORS 11E FROSH +28 28
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEERTX 12I EXCRETE +89 99
#note Cool!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AKW K10 WA.K +26 54
#note I saw the O and Y hook (of course the S hook is a given), and forgot about the E hook.
>Joshua_Sokol: BIIPTVY N10 BI.TY +32 131
#note Given the hooks I saw, I think BI(T)TY is safer. It also partially blocks the O lane.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EGOTU O6 TOGUE +22 76
>Joshua_Sokol: AADIPPV N3 VAPID +20 151
#note I think I had AP as a leave. I know I had A.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ENNW 14J WENN. +33 109
#note Well, there's the E hook.
>Joshua_Sokol: AFJOPRR 15H FRO +23 174
#note Forgot that WACK was an adjective.

>Terry_Kang_Rau: ADIQ 10B QADI +39 165
>Joshua_Sokol: AABEINY M2 YA +27 252
#note lol, I didn't see JIBE. This is fine though, as it sets up points with LAVA/LAVE and gives me a pretty good leave, especially given the 22/17 consonant/vowel pool.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?DEILOT 14B TOLuIDE +73 238
#note DOLErIT(E) and LEpIDOT(E) score better than this.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEEINS I2 BEANIES +63 315
#note Cool.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: HOO 15A OOH +25 263
>Joshua_Sokol: EILRRSS O1 RIEL +25 340
#note (FRO)RE 15H is also an option (probably not a good one though). I didn't even know FRORE, let alone remember WACKER. JALAPS/SNIT is a decent idea too, but I don't think I should really fish at this point.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EO 13C OE +18 281
>Joshua_Sokol: IMRSSTZ H4 ZIT +47 387
>Terry_Kang_Rau: MU L8 MU +14 295
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CMRSSV C9 V.C +12 399
#note I was surprised that I drew the blank. I still think it's a good idea to seal the board off, and this play does a great job. Other options are V(A)S, same spot, M(EL)S D12 and C(W)M 10J.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AR 13K .AR. +25 320
#note Nice fit.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?MNRSSU J5 SeRS +13 412
#note M(EL)S D12 again, or J1 SoMS/SiMS give me more points in the endgame, but I really wanted to make sure she couldn't bingo out with a silly 9.
