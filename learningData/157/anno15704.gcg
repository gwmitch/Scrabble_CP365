>Shauna_Petrie: ELORW 8G LOWER +16 16
#note This is the sloppiest tournament game I've ever played.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDIMNOU J3 MOUND.D +13 13
#note OD(E)UM J6, DI(R)DUM K6 (new word), MU(E)DDIN J6, DOUM 7J, MOD/DOM 9H or 7H, DIDO 9F, DUOMI 9C, D(R)UID, (R)UDD, the list of better moves goes on and on.
>Shauna_Petrie: AQRT 5I Q.ART +28 44
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIIOOY N5 OY +28 41
>Shauna_Petrie: BENOY O6 EBONY +35 79
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIIOW 3J .IOAW +20 61
#note Yes, you're reading correctly. I put down MIOAW instead of MIAOW. I have no good explanation for it, as I wrote down my play as MIAOW and reminded myself to spell the word correctly before laying it down. Maybe I laid it down upside-down though. Anyways, Shauna didn't even challenge!
>Shauna_Petrie: ?BEILNR N8 NuBILER +94 173
#note She said 93, and I counted the play and said that it was 94, not 93. She recounted and agreed with me. She drew her tiles. I looked at the board and saw her play as if for the first time and literally facepalmed. I was sure she had put down NuBILES, which is also phony. I realized later that I was confusing NUBILES* it with NUPTIALS, an adjective that's also a noun and is related to marriage. I have never seen two consecutive moves that have been so ridiculous.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEINXZ O13 DEX +38 99
#note A nice setup that was probably not going to work.
>Shauna_Petrie: FGI M13 FIG +31 204
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CIMNSZ O1 MISC +44 143
#note I couldn't find any play but MISC*, which I thought I would be able to get away with. Remember, this pluralizes MIOAWS. She didn't budge. Three (even four) phonies in a row now. I still hadn't noticed my misspelling of MIAOW, and apparently neither had Shauna. She told me later that it looked weird.
>Shauna_Petrie: AEGINNR 7A GRANNIE +63 267
#note ANGERIN(G)/ENRAGIN(G) 15F. G(LOWER) ENGRAIN or GRANNIE 9C.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AALNPZ F6 Z.P +45 188

#note SAINTDo(M) 1H.
>Shauna_Petrie: ATUV 14C VATU +13 322
>Joshua_Sokol: CJKRTUV C1 JUR.T +24 317
#note So I actually managed to make the game closer, but this rack gave me a headache. I wondered if I should play JUR(A)T D11 or C1. I saw an O in the bag so I didn't want to give Shauna a lot of points with JO if she had it, so I decided it was safer to play it at C1. Now that I see the possibility or RAJ or HAJ I really don't like my play. I didn't see V(A)CU(A) J(A)CK or J(A)UK C6, which are probably worth considering. The sim is liking my JURAT best for some odd reason.
>Shauna_Petrie: AT 1A TA. +30 352
#note Sadface.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEFKOV 2M KO. +30 347
#note At this point I realize MIOAWS* is on the board, and start to ridicule myself in my head. The only reason I saw it is because it looked like my best play was KO(I) 2M. I was pretty sure she didn't know AEGISES, only bingo I saw in the bag. I also can't worry about her bingoing at this point. The sim is liking FEE(D) then FEO(D) 9G, which I only spotted after the fact. It also likes FOVE(A)E D10, which I missed as well. 
>Shauna_Petrie: ES 9E ES +17 369
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEEFHV 13I CHEF... +22 369
#note I took my longest for this turn. I didn't know if CHEF(FED) 13I was good, didn't like how many points CHEF 10B likely gave her, and didn't think anything else was going to win. I saw H(U)E and forgot about it, which would block her scoring with AG(U)E. Anyways, I felt like I had to play CHEFFED, which she held and let go, amazingly. And even more amazingly was that it was good. Champ player thinks my best winning chances lie with CHEF 10B, and the many ply sim thinks CHEFFED is by far the best move.
>Shauna_Petrie: AEEEIIS 6H SI.E +17 386
#note SIEVE, ELAIN and TAJES win.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGV 2B G.V +20 389
>Shauna_Petrie: AEEI C12 EA.E +14 400
>Joshua_Sokol: EE I8 .EE +11 400
#note What a ridiculous game. I didn't feel like I won.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (I) +2 402
