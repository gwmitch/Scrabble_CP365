#note Probably the only time I'll ever get to open with this word.  
>Virtual_Balboa: EINOPRW 7C WOP +25 25
>George: AAEQTYY 9B YAY +23 71
#note 3rd best. Jerk move. Same word 2 spots over is 11 more points.
>Virtual_Balboa: EILLNRT G8 .LL +4 29
>George: AEOPQST 10A QAT +23 94
#note Best. It was between this, QATS 11D or something hooking the P onto OXY.  I didn't see QATS I5.  Even if I did, I would have kept the S for 8 fewer points.
>Virtual_Balboa: EINRTTW 11B WERT +26 55
>George: CEOPRST 6B COP +34 128
#note Missed 2 bingos, one of which is a super-easy find that I know from real life.
>Virtual_Balboa: EILNOOT 5C TELOI +33 88
>George: AEIRSST I2 SATIRES +76 204
#note Now there's a bingo I can find!  
>Virtual_Balboa: ENOOSUV A1 VENOUS +38 126
>George: ?EHINRU 3F UNH.IREd +72 276
#note One in a 4-way tie for second-best play.  Best is U(S)HERINg 2H for 14 more points.
>Virtual_Balboa: ?EGMOTU 2D GUM +22 148
>George: ADNNOTV 1F AVO +23 299
#note This one didn't even show up on the list, but it's worth 2 more points than anything that did.  I hated the leave, but I couldn't find D(E)VON L2.  
>Virtual_Balboa: ?EFFKOT 4L TOFF +33 181
>George: ADGNNTZ B2 DAN +18 317
#note Why did I play AVO?  Missed a bunch of good ones here.  ZAG 5K, ADZ 2M or H10, etc.  I hated this leave too, but I convinced myself that the board was still open enough for an ING bingo.  
>Virtual_Balboa: ?AEEKNR 6G dA.KENER +74 255
>George: BDEGNTZ K5 Z.D +26 343
#note This definitely didn't feel like the best play, but it was.  Thanks, Quacky.
>Virtual_Balboa: ADEEGII 5M GIE +19 274
>George: ABEGNOT 10F B.OG +13 356
#note Only 13 points, but it takes away a bingo lane, I didn't see many other options and I love the leave.  
>Virtual_Balboa: AADEIRS 4H A. +9 283
>George: AEIILNT E11 .I +2 358
#note I was 98% sure I was missing something here, and even once I got okay with the fact that I didn't see the bingo, I made probably the worst play of the game.  This kind of move usually only works for Dan Stock.
