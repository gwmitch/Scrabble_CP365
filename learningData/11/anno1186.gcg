>David: CFIIOPU -FIOPU +0 0
#note Very perplexing move, if the rack is accurate. Seems like a tossup between FUCI or PFUI.

#note Clearly better than METEOR H10, I thought, and sim agrees.

#note A tough rack, but I was happy with my choice. EXIT? No thanks. 
>David: GJNOOUU N6 OU.GUN +11 159
>Bing: BEEIMRX O11 EMBER +38 232
#note I couldn't see any reason over the board to give up 3 points with BIREME/BERIME, and I still think EMBER is best.

>Bing: AIINORX B10 ANOXI. +30 262
#note This was a brutal decision. I thought hard about AXION M2: obviously, ANOXIA is riskier, but AXION is not totally safe either, and scores 4 points less. One pretty good move that I didn't spot is NOIR 14E.

#note As Dave noted in his analysis, this was a pretty weak move. Indeed, I was so embarrassed that I tried to suppress the rack, but now the secret's out. There just weren't that many bingos I could hope to draw (RINDERPEST wasn't even possible), and I was pretty much forced into another fishing move on the next rack.
