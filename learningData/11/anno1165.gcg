>Quackle: ACEERTW 8G WE +10 10
>Kelly: FNRRSTZ H6 TR.F +7 7
#note Strongly considered N(E)RTZ, CP’s preferred choice, but didn’t like wasting the Z and placing it in a DWS lane to boot.
>Quackle: AACERTV 6H .AV +14 24
>Kelly: HLNNRSZ -HLN +0 7
#note I knew CP would hate this exchange, and would want me to ditch the Z. It likes passing HLNZ most of the exchanges, but Wapnick taught me to keep at least one high-point tile to score with next turn. Who can I trust?

>Quackle: EEEENOS 13I .EE +12 139
>Kelly: ?ABPUXY 11K AY +21 114
#note I couldn’t find anything remotely palatable, so decided to get as many points as possible and hope things improved next time. CP likes BAU(D)-M9, which sets up a possible X-bomb, and possible TWS counter-play if Quackle takes the spot first.
>Quackle: EEMNOOS M5 MOONSEE. +69 208
>Kelly: ?BJPSUX 6L B.X +28 142
#note Fourth choice. JU(M)P-5K looks better. I also missed SUP/SUB-13M, a possibility I will continue to miss for the rest of the game.
>Quackle: ADIIMOO 8K AM.IO +30 238
>Kelly: ?BJNPSU I3 JUB. +21 163
#note A tossup between this and SUB-13M.
>Quackle: DEEGILO J1 EGO +17 255
>Kelly: ?ILNNPS 1G PIN. +18 181
#note Few things are more demoralizing than missing a bingo you’ve studied, in this case PINNUL(E)S-1D.

>Kelly: ?ILNOQS O1 QI +38 219
>Quackle: ADDGOPR K1 DOG +27 316
>Kelly: ?LLNOSU 3M L.S +18 237
#note If I’m going to burn the S, the best ways to do it are (E)NSOUL-14I or SUN-13M.

>Kelly: ?ALLNOU L4 LA. +15 252
>Quackle: IOSTTUV G1 .IVOT +14 425
>Kelly: ??LNORU F4 NU +6 258
#note Two blanks and no bingoes. Sums this one up, I think.
>Quackle: DGISTUU E5 GUID +20 445
>Kelly: ??CLNOR 14L COL. +12 270
#note Two bingoes this time: ORCiNoL-D8 and aCROLe(I)n-2A. But if you don’t know them, they are difficult to play.

#note At least I broke 300.
