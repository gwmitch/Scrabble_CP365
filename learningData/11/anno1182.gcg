#note Strangely, I forgot to look for bingos through the D. IDOLATRY is safest.

#note Glad this was no longer a nongo!  I would have had to settle for something like AMADOU K7 instead.
>Bing: DEEHIXZ A4 .IXED +45 245
>Joey: ?EEFTUU B6 UTE +21 225
#note Close call between this and FUTURE.  I figured that even if I didn't draw a bingo, I'd have something like FUD H1 for a decent score.
>Bing: EEHIKOZ H1 ZE. +39 284
>Joey: ?AEFNPU N10 FE +28 253
#note This was probably a mistake.  Despite the blank, this wasn't that strong a rack on this board.  FAUN 6F appears to be the play, with four cracks at a natural PREMIXED.
>Bing: CEHIKOT O11 CHOKE +59 343
#note A huge break that put me comfortably ahead.
>Joey: ?AANPSU 6I PAN. +20 273
#note UNAPT gets rid of the final U.  Those were a real nuisance this game.
>Bing: AEIIMPT 5C IMP +28 371
#note Suppressing the urge to try for PREMIXED.
>Joey: ?AALSSU K9 ASSAULt +68 341
#note The only bingo.  Now if I can just avoid the dreck that was awaiting....
>Bing: AEFINOT J9 FOIN +27 398
>Joey: BCGRRVV -BCGRVV +0 341
#note I did not avoid the dreck.  Maybe he'll wind up with some of it.
>Bing: AAEELQT I11 QAT +28 426
>Joey: INNORRT J2 N.R +5 346
#note Not much of an improvement, since I really needed to be able to score more and also bingo.
>Bing: AEEGLRW 15H WEL.ER +27 453
#note Not sure it was the greatest idea to play so many tiles, given the horrendous tile bag. At least I didn't empty the bag with WERGELT, which could lose to a few unlikely out-bingos.
>Joey: EINNORT 8A ..N +4 350
#note No real sense in going for anything since it would just get blocked.
>Bing: ABGGOVV G6 VO. +10 463
#note Quackle comes up with BO 14G, to set up VAV.
>Joey: CEINORT D8 TRICE +22 372
#note For spread purposes, REMIXED is best threatening TONIC.
