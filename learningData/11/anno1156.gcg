#note Best is GRAMME.  I would have guessed it was #.  MM is about 2.3 points behind.
>John_Luebkemann: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Dave_Koenig: ADEGORV I3 VAGRO. +17 29
#note Apparently this is a pretty serious error.  VOE 9G sims best.  It's got a serious defensive advantage over the 7G placement, which is 1.1 points behind.  VAGROM is a whopping 8 points behind.
>John_Luebkemann: EH G8 HE +16 16
#note How frustrating!  I had just studied the -EDLY list before the tourney and was itching to throw down MATTEDLY.  From the short discussion I had with Looby after the game, it seems he would have challenged it.  At least I still have a bingo.
>Dave_Koenig: ?ADETTY 6D YATTe.ED +65 94
>John_Luebkemann: ADEFINS 10B FADEINS +77 93
>Dave_Koenig: EGIJORS 4H J.GER +42 136
#note Sim prefers the C9 placement by about half a point.  This is very counterintuitive to me.  The board is much harder to bingo on after my play.  However, it is easier to make good scoring parallel plays alongside FADEINS, so maybe that's the reason.
>John_Luebkemann: DEZ 9C ZED +50 143
>Dave_Koenig: AEIINOS E5 N.IA..S +32 168
#note Here I went for the stylish play, although I was very unsure it was the smartest thing to do, given the three vowel leave.  Before I spotted the play, I had considered OI 7D, which sims 3.5 points ahead of this.  Obviously OI gives me some bingo potential, but another factor that I didn't think about during the game is that I can still probably play NAIADES on the next turn if nothing better develops.

>Dave_Koenig: ACEIIOW 3K WOE +19 187
#note This is a very frustrating situation in which I don't have any big scoring plays, my leaves aren't all that great, and exchanges sim very poorly.  Surprisingly, the sim winner is WAIL, maybe partially because it helps clean out the rack and partially because it reduces the potency of the BEDEL-L hook when there are still three L's unseen.  DOWIE is another good play that I might have made, if I could have remembered with more surety that it did not take an S.  Despite leaving two I's, my play is also a good one, simming only 0.6 behind WAIL.  DOWIE is 0.3 back.

>Dave_Koenig: ABCIIWY D2 BYWA. +34 221
#note This was a very nice play to clean out the drek and score well, but I greedily wished that I had a U for SUBWAY.
>John_Luebkemann: FR 3B FR. +18 225
>Dave_Koenig: CIIORRT 11G TORII +19 240
#note Believe it or not, I was doubting myself on the validity of TORIC, even though I'm sure I've played it multiple times before.  I was already starting to feel the "Looby time pressure," and that might have affected my thinking.  Although I thought that TORIC was the better play, there were a few reasons why this was a decent alternative.  CR has better synergy than IR, and there were still a bunch of I's unseen.  TORIC sims 2.5 ahead.
>John_Luebkemann: ?LLOORT 13A TROLLOp +71 296
>Dave_Koenig: CGHKOPR 10J PORCH +38 278
#note Getting low on time, I was happy to have a play to clear a whole lot of the consonants out of the rack quickly and score well.  Even though I knew the GK leave wasn't great, this seemed like the natural play, and I couldn't afford to spend a lot of time thinking of alternatives.  However, it sims considerably worse than plays using the K, which can really be a rack killer.  If I had realized that KOPH in the same spot outscored my play, I might have gone for it.  But the best simming play is the ballsy KOP.  This leaves four consonants, but with just a little bit of vowelage, it can set up some really high scoring plays with the H hook on column M.  I love this play and like to think I might have come up with it if I had more time.  I'd also like to think that it would have been rewarded with an AIN draw.  KOPH is about 4.5 points back, and PORCH is almost 12(!) back.
>John_Luebkemann: EINU A11 UN.IE +18 314
>Dave_Koenig: EGKNOTV 15A .VOKE +17 295
#note Top simming plays are this and TOKE 2L, which looks just crazy to me.

>Dave_Koenig: AAEGNTU 2C A.UT +10 305
#note John had very quickly thrown his tiles in last turn, putting the time pressure right back on me.  So I quickly threw down ABUT, the first logical play that had come to my attention.  There are a number of alternatives that are pretty close to each other here.  Although it may not be the best choice, it's a perfectly playable move, and a good choice given the time situation.  I'm keeping pretty good letters, creating a new bingo lane, and leaving the C and H of PORCH open for bingos.  Sim prefers UNCAGE M8, which scores well and has a nice two letter leave.  It seems suicidal to slot the U with the Q unseen, but it's a pretty likely inference that he just traded the Q back.  (And that he did not have an I, else QI 2A.)  Given that likelihood, UNCAGE might be even better than Quackle thinks it is, because I've got a good chance of drawing the Q myself.  Of course, in my extreme time pressure, I wasn't even considering those kinds of inferences.

#note When you're desperately short of time and don't have the luxury to think clearly about how likely you are to win in various scenarios, plays that speed up the end of the game while keeping you within striking distance seem preferable.  In retrospect, I'm a big enough underdog that fishing makes more sense here.  The best way to do it is PIA J10, which creates nice hooks for my L and N.
>John_Luebkemann: IQS N1 QIS +31 369
>Dave_Koenig: ADEIUUX O1 ID +45 373
#note I think it was on this turn that I went overtime.  Quack thinks that we both played the endgame perfectly, but in my case it was just lucky guessing.  John, of course, had something like 15 minutes left.
>John_Luebkemann: CEINO 1A ICE +18 387
#note Blocks AXE in the same spot and gives him just enough to win, even if I hadn't gone overtime.

#note Minus 10 for me on the clock.  Final score 393-404.
