>Pete_Zeigler: CDEEORT 8D COTED +22 22
#note Best.
>George_Viebranz: ADEEHIT D8 .HIDE +22 22
#note Not on the list.  HIE 7G is best.
>Pete_Zeigler: CEGIORT 13C ERGOTIC +90 112
>George_Viebranz: ABEFLNT 14F FAT +31 53
#note Quackle likes F(I)NE  or F(I)AT H12.  If I had seen FIAT, I would have done that. Mainly I wanted to keep the E.  
>Pete_Zeigler: AEKOOSS H12 K..S +39 151
#note Far down on the list, I assume because of the leave.  SOOK 15H is best, gives him a better S hook and gets rid of shitty Os.  I wouldn't guess from either play that he had another S.
>George_Viebranz: ?ABBELN 10C B.NdABLE +63 116
#note I wasn't as sure of this one as BENdABL(E) G1, but still sure enough to try it.  Pete held, but, wisely, did not challenge.
>Pete_Zeigler: AAEOOSY 11C O.A +16 167
>George_Viebranz: GIILPRW 7G WIG +25 141
#note I really thought a bingo was coming after O(D)A, but I didn't have many options with my rack.  WIG is best.  It scores 25, and if he uses the S hook, I can hopefully use whatever lands in row 1.
>Pete_Zeigler: AAEOSVY 6G AY +18 185
>George_Viebranz: IIILPRT F4 RIP +25 166
#note for some reason I thought IILT would be a better leave than IIRT.  Quackle disagrees, but only by a point.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEMORSV E3 ROM +20 205
#note Missed OVE(R)ARMS, which I guess he saw and chickened out on.  
>George_Viebranz: EIILSTU J2 UTILISE +69 235
#note I didn't think drawing to IILT was the worst thing in the world, but I definitely didn't think I'd bingo on my next turn.  
>Pete_Zeigler: AEJNRSV D1 JEAN +46 251
#note Best.
>George_Viebranz: DEHOPUW 1D .OWED +48 283
#note I hate leaving Us, but this was a no-brainer.  
>Pete_Zeigler: ELNRSUV -  +0 251
#note Pete, you know what to study for Buffalo.
>George_Viebranz: AEEHPTU 15E UTE. +13 296
#note This is one of the underdeveloped aspects of my game.  What can you infer about Pete's rack by A) His previous play of JEAN and B) the fact that he challenged a word that he has undoubtedly seen before?  Is he close to bingoing?  Does he have absolute shit?  Why is it better or worse to challenge when you have a great or a shitty rack?  

#note Anyone with $0.02 can comment on my LJ or email me at gcviebranzjr(at)gmail(dot)com.

#note I'm afraid I got overly cautious on this play.  There is any number of better plays that score more with a better leave, but leave that S open at the bottom.  
>Pete_Zeigler: ELNRSUV 5J .UV +12 263 
>George_Viebranz: AEFHIPT 3C E..TH +30 326
#note Wish I had seen FEH 11J.  I think I just wanted to be flashy.  Maybe playing off my E was dumb.  Quackle's favorite is FAITH 11J but I know he has an S and I don't want to lose the game.  
>Pete_Zeigler: ELNNRRS 2I R.NNEL +12 275
#note LOL... Quackle's favorite play is (BO)N(E)R C10.  What a perv.
>George_Viebranz: AAFIPQR 11J FAQIR +39 365
#note Ok, now I really don't have any choice.  I knew this would be the best play, but it made me pretty nervous and I felt like it could be the play to lose the game for me.  
>Pete_Zeigler: AEOORSS O1 OSAR +22 297
#note Great, now he has 2 esses again.
>George_Viebranz: ?AIMNNP N10 P.IMA +30 395
#note I was unsure about this word.  I know PRIM has like 90 back hooks, I wasn't 100% sure this was one of them.  
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEOOSV O7 OAVES +46 343
#note Best.
>George_Viebranz: ?DNNUXY O14 XU +36 431
#note This was dumber than it seemed at the time.  I thought I had an out on my next turn though.  
>Pete_Zeigler: EGILOZ 12K LI +28 371
#note Still thinking I had an out, I wondered why Pete didn't make a Z play.
>George_Viebranz: ?DNNY B3 DuNNY +20 451 
>George_Viebranz: ?DNNY --  -20 431
#note Maybe I was thinking TUNNY? 
>Pete_Zeigler: EGOZ M1 G.EZ +28 399
#note Hope you enjoy the free spread, Pete.
>George_Viebranz: ?DNNY B3 DeNY +25 456
#note What I should have done before.
>Pete_Zeigler: O 13M O. +8 407
>Pete_Zeigler:  (N) +2 409
