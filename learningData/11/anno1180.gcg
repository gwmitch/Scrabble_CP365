#note I get a poor grade for this turn.  When I saw the rack the first things that jumped out to me were FITCH and HITCH.  Of course, I'd rather play the F, but I found myself very unsure of FITCH's validity.  I saw CHIEF/FICHE, but I failed to consider that the TH leave is at least as good at the EH leave.  Didn't know FETICH, but it sims about equally with FITCH and FICHE as the best play.  HITCH is 4.2 back.

#note I didn't love blocking up the board when I was already down, but it seemed that this scored enough, kept me close enough, and kept a good enough leave to be worthwhile.  I'm quite frankly surprised that FE G13 simmed best, 5 points ahead of my play.  Sure, the BDEOR leave is pretty versatile and unlikely to get too messed up with only a two tile draw, but the rack doesn't exactly scream "bingo" with a B on it.  And ten points seems like a lot to give up to me.  I'd rather keep scoring a lot and keep the game as close as I can, instead of shedding so many points that I fall further back and become more desperate for a bingo.  But all of Quack's favorite plays (FE, EF, OF, and FOB) are short plays here.  What does the computer understand that I don't here?

#note Dang!  He blocked PYRENOID, I thought immediately.  Fortunately a little bit of scanning the board found me another nice play.

#note I really wanted to make a play on column E that was long enough to hit the double word, but I couldn't find a way to do it.  It seems there isn't one.  My play does pretty well in the sim, but I completely missed the BIO-G hook on this turn and the next one.  I've made this mistake before.  Even though I know the new word BIOG, it is not drilled in my head to spot that hook yet.  Hopefully, this game will stop me from repeating that error.  Sim prefers TEG J8 (2 points ahead of my play) or just making BIOG (1.5 points ahead).  Also interesting are GATE/GAPE 7C creating the front A hook.

#note Believe it or not, I spent a long time questioning myself on whether this was a word.  By the end, I couldn't remember, but I decided that I couldn't afford not to play it here.  Gotta keep reviewing the high probs.
>Joe_Edley: ?ADEILT 3H In.LATED +72 246
>Dave_Koenig: IINOQRT 2H QI +23 202
#note This play makes a lot of sense and is ahead of all the other Q plays in the sim.  It keeps together a fairly good bingo rack, opens a new bingo line on row 1, and also stops him from scoring on H1 to H4, when I'm not prepared to score there myself.  However, there is one very clever play that sims about 1.5 ahead (though it is lower on winning percentage, for what that's worth).  That play is DINITRO 3O, which creates the high scoring Q spot at N6.  I suppose there are enough other good spots for the Q that it has a decent chance of scoring well even if N6 gets blocked, but any way you look at it this is really a rolling-the-dice play, hoping to get a favorable draw to that Q.  I love the creativity of the play, but something in my head tells me that QI is the more sensible way to go, especially because I want to get a bingo down before things get too blocked up.

#note Once again, a bingo gets me back within striking distance, but then I get Lesterized.  (See XPmorgan's blog for a definition.)  Joe gets almost all the big scoring plays the rest of the way and makes this one look more lopsided than it was for most of the game.

#note Pretty much a necessity, both to clear out some consonants, and because this is where his highest scoring plays are likely to be.

#note This seemed like a decent fish to me, as any of AAAOOSS gives me a bingo.  The downside, of course, is that it is rather obvious.  He can probably find a decent way to block even if he doesn't have a hook letter.  Sim prefers DIP M12, which is a good choice.  It sets up the T hook on row 15, and gives me S ending bingos on column N.
