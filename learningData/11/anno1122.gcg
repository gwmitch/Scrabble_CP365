#note QI is slightly weaker than K8 CRIT or exchanging QRV.

>me: CEORTTV 9D COVER +19 41
#note If I see VECTOR, I play it.  This is the kind of crap that keeps me from being good. 
#note Quackle also likes fishing off a T at 5K or 5L.

#note VAT M3 slightly favored over VARMINT.

#note I was fiiiiiiixated on that T at N5.  I didn't even think of the C column.  Dumbass.

#note The only bingo.  This is insane, but Quackle prefers fishing off EN at 11K, fiving up 45 points, to playing the bingo.  Quackle prefers this both in win % and in equity.

>me: FHLNNOO 11J FON +29 299
#note Quackle prefers 12D OOH.  I considered that play.  At this point, though, I'm thinking that I need to be able to set up some sort of desperation bingo line.  And maybe if I draw the S, my next play hooking INN can set up a line that way.  I'm running out of real estate here.
>Joel: EEEMORU 3G EME +21 356
>me: EEHLNOU 12K ON +16 315
#note It's an attempt.  One that will never win, but an attempt nonetheless.  I couldn't find any possibilities to fish for.  E11 JEU leaves the option of UNHOLIER.  That is, if Joel goes insane and doesn't block.

#note As he was laying down his tiles, I saw he was opening stuff, and hoped that he'd mistracked and was giving me the A to play off of, but no dice.
