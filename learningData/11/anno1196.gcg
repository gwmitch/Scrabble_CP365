#note oddly enough, Champ likes this #1.  I don't have the energy to sim it though.  Any comments?

#note forgot about BEANO.  Also, BEE for 2 fewer points is better here with the [AENO] leave and keeping a back-hook.  Without looking at an extended sim, I sort of like it better than BEANO.

#note Champ likes it.  Also considered BEZANT, but the [FU] leave is just that.

#note Champ likes it.  I guess if I had kept the board more open then the 7 might have gone down.

#note not a good move here.  While I am down ~100, I don't need to be this desparate.  WON@C11 is obviously best with my play not even making the cut.
