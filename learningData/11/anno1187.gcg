#note Alas, I wouldn’t notice the potential for (OI)NG plays until next turn. HAL(OI)NG-E5 crushes all the other plays. Even missing that, better options are plays along the M column like THAW-M6.

>Kelly: GLNOTTV E6 LO..NG +27 249
#note I had almost settled on VOLT(E)-O4, CP’s top play, before noticing the OI spot. Still, the points don’t compensate for the awful leave.

#note At this point, CP called me a poser and pointed out a bunch of routine eights that are better.

#note The best of the non-exchanges. I never would have anticipated exchanging is better here, but CP wants me to trade in everything but the E.

#note Apparently, I can block all of the potential bingoes with plays like WAMB(L)y-5I. I hope I can remember that word next time it comes up. Being inept and lazy, I decided to play it safe and get enough points to win even if Gavin bingoes.
