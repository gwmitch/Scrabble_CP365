#note (B)EYLIC is the clear winner here.  I thought about this one a lot and considered the two placements for ICY for 13 for a while, but then thought that it only puts me up 30, whereas BYLINE puts me up 51.  That was the kicker.  Even though it sets up big plays on row 15, either of these positions could have big come backs, so I went for the points.  Quackle doesn't seem to agree as BYLINE comes in 6th place after BEYLIC, 3 different plays of ICYand LEI@7F.  Someone please explain why LEI is even an option.
>QWERTY: CENOPVW B12 POW +32 53
>Brett_H: CHIINTZ H4 CHIN.Z +23 93
#note  this is the only play I really considered here.  It scores decent and the leave is good.  Even looking at all of Champs suggestions, I still like my play best.  The only other ones I would consider might be Z(I)TI@F7=21[CHIN] or CH(I)TIN@F6=25.  Please tell me why Q prefers (L)ITCHI and (L)ITHIC @ 11C=22 to my play (as well as ZITI and CHITIN of course)

>Brett_H: EHIMSTY 15C SMITHY +63 156
#note  Maybe Q didn't like my moves on my last play because he knew I would be blocking MYTHIEST and THYMIEST as well as SMITHERY.

>Brett_H: ?AAEIOU A13 EAU +18 174
#note  sims best.  I was getting a little nervous about that easy scoring spot and glad to have a word for it.

>Brett_H: ??AEFST 1D FASTEn.r +89 263
#note  no 3x3's!?!  Damn.  I missed (D)wArFEST and SulFATE(D) both for 92.  This was one of 7 for 89.
>QWERTY: ADEIIMO M1 IMIDO +28 230
>Brett_H: AABGLNO 2A GOBAN +23 286
#note  I put GOBAN down almost immediately, but then considered B(R)OGAN and (K)ALONG {one of my favorite 5s to make 6s}.  I like GOBAN because it scored and didn't open up an S hook.  Q puts it 4th after ABO@2D=20, KALONG, and BOA@2E=17.
>QWERTY: AEELNOT 3C ONE +23 253
>Brett_H: AEFLLWX N6 FL.X +22 308
#note wow, my first big miss and it's a doozy.  AXE@4B=46 is the clear winner here with min a full 20 points back.
>QWERTY: AEGLSTT 4B TAG +29 282
>Brett_H: AEEILVW 1A AW +29 337
#note  and another one.  (R)EVIEWAL.  Can't say that even if I saw it I would have been 100% on it.  Either way, mine sims 2nd, but a distant second.  53 points back.
>QWERTY: DEELOST N6 ....ED +19 301
>Brett_H: AEEILPV L7 P.EVAIL +24 361
#note This is Champ's choice, but a sim puts (K)EP@M8=24 best followed by ALEP(H)@5D=29 and (K)EPI@M8=28.  I like mine a little better than these because it gets 6 tiles of turnover (which hastens the endgame), puts me up 60, and closes down some easy lanes (granted it opens an L lane and a tight I line and 7 S-hook lane). 
>QWERTY: ELOORST F7 O. +11 312
>Brett_H: AADERRU I9 AURAR +19 380
#note Dodged a bullet with this one.  I was just going to play AURA, but his TROLLIES would have fit right under it.  I didn't even see the possibility, I just wanted to play off an extra tile.  This is what will kill me in a tourney.
