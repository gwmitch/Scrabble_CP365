>Steve: ABMOQRS 8G MOB +14 14
#note Q prefers exchanging BQ or BOQ, equally. 
>Lisa_Slankard: EFIN 9F FINE +21 21
>Steve: AQRRSSV 10E VARS +24 38
>Lisa_Slankard: AI 7G AI +14 35
>Steve: CEPQRSU 6H CEP +20 58
#note Third best, to QU(AI), and then PEC. I chose CEP, hoping to take advantage of the many hooks it set up. I was hoping to score big with the Q.
>Lisa_Slankard: ERY J9 RYE +22 57
>Steve: BEGQRSU K3 SQUEG +38 96
>Lisa_Slankard: DIJOOOS L3 OI +28 85
>Steve: BIRTTUZ 11I Z.BU +30 126
#note I really wanted to take a chance here and play TUB at M1, but chose to play cautiously. Mainly because she seemed to be grooming her rack for the last three turns. Z(E)BU is best.
>Lisa_Slankard: DEJOOSU 5D DOJOS +34 119
>Steve: ?CEIRTT 4A CITE +24 150
#note Not as timid in setting up a triple line after her five tile play. Huge error, missing the one playable bingo, however.
>Lisa_Slankard: AELLNOT A4 .OLLATE +27 146
>Steve: ??RTTTX B8 TaX +53 203
#note It's better to be lucky than good.
>Lisa_Slankard: U 3K ..U +6 152
>Steve: ?DENRTT N2 TRiDENT +72 275
#note Best of two bingos that play. I wouldn't have seen the eight.
>Lisa_Slankard: AEGNR O8 ANGER +27 179
#note Was happy to see these good tiles leave her rack.

>Steve: AIIIUWW -AIIUWW +0 275
#note Classic case of bingo revenge. I decide to keep an I since it's the vowel with the least chance of duplicating on the next pull.
>Lisa_Slankard: AF O1 FA +17 196
>Steve: AHHINRV 12L HAI. +24 299
#note The need to block the -s hook bingo line is paramount. But H(U)H or H(U)NH are better.
>Lisa_Slankard: DGI 11A DIG +26 222
>Steve: DHLMNRV E4 D.RM +15 314
#note I'm not sure why Q doesn't mention this play in its choices, but it does sim second best. Q likes H(I)ND in the N column.
>Lisa_Slankard: N M12 .N +4 226
#note An obvious set up.
>Steve: EHKLNNV 14L KEN +17 331
#note I chose this over LEV at C7, thinking it would be tougher for her to bingo, and that it was worth the six point sacrifice. LEV is best.
>Lisa_Slankard: AEOPRST 12D PROTEAS +88 314
#note Her bingo plays for three points more on row 15. My attempt at a block was obviously for naught.
>Steve: AEEHLNV C7 LEV +23 354
#note Vowels have breathed life into the rack. Now I play LEV, but Q likes HE at 3B. With the tile pool it's unlikely if not impossible for Lisa to bingo, but I'm a scaredy cat. And yet, Q says HE wins 96 percent while LEV just 91 percent of the time.
>Lisa_Slankard: AIL E10 .I.AL +16 330
>Steve: AEHNOOY O14 OY +23 377
#note I really wanted to play HOO()L)Y, just wasn't 100 percent on it being good. More like 60.
>Lisa_Slankard: IIUWW C2 WI. +12 342
>Steve: AEHNO 10L HAN. +19 396
#note Best is ENHA(L)O or AH(I).
>Lisa_Slankard: IUW M12 ...W +7 349
