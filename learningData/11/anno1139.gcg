>Magrathean: EEHHILR 8G HEH +18 18
#note this was the first time I'd ever played Sam, and I did pretty well, other than the awful missed bingo.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AINV 9F VINA +23 23
>Magrathean: AEEIILR 7D ILEA +12 30
#note for some reason I was reluctant to play VIE, but I think it's pretty clearly best
>Sam_Kantimathi: DEEG 8A GEED +29 52
>Magrathean: EIINRRW 6B WIRER +28 58
#note dear GOD, how did I miss REWIRING??? On the plus side, he almost challenged WIRER
>Sam_Kantimathi: AEM 5C MAE +25 77

>Sam_Kantimathi: ILNNS 9K LINNS +20 163
>Magrathean: IILNOPT 5H PINITOL +72 187
#note Again, Sam held me for a couple of minutes but didn't challenge.
>Sam_Kantimathi: FTTU 3H TUFT +13 176
>Magrathean: ?BCDOUV 6K DUB +18 205
#note it's this or the adorable CUTUP extension
>Sam_Kantimathi: ACOX N1 COXA. +28 204
#note at this point, Sam overdraws, showing an E, an O and a Y. I throw back the E.
>Magrathean: ?CEGNOV M2 GO +27 232
#note it's interesting - this move may do ok in the sim, but Sam pointed out later that I know he has OY, so I should be pretty afraid of his comeback plays on column O. So it looks like burning the blank for 51 and playing CONVECT might be right, which didn't occur to me at all
>Sam_Kantimathi: DOY O2 YOD +31 235
>Magrathean: ?ACEINV B8 .NACtIVE +78 310
#note I think Sam held me on this play as well.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DLOPQRZ 15A R.ZIP +51 286
>Sam_Kantimathi: DLOPQRZ --  -51 235
#note A pretty big mistake, given that he had ZEP for 42 to give him a fighting chance. He claimed SOWPODS confusion, but I don't think it is collins. Oh well.
>Magrathean: ADEEOST 15A T.ED +21 331
#note Quackle likes ENDOSTEA, which I saw, but I don't think it makes any kind of sense. Why open the board wide open and give him a guaranteed 42 points next turn!
>Sam_Kantimathi: ELOPQRZ 13A Z.P +28 263
>Magrathean: AAEIOOS -AAIOO +0 331
#note nope - according to quackle, should either play GOA (huh?) or keep EIS, because of the vowel shortage, I guess.
>Sam_Kantimathi: IQS D11 QIS +39 302
>Magrathean: EEFMRRS C2 FER.. +20 351
>Sam_Kantimathi: BLO B1 LOB +24 326
#note OK, this is the preendgame that I was talking about. Nothing fancy, just tell me what the best play is.
>Magrathean: EIMNORS E10 MIS +34 385
#note OK, this wasn't it. Best is MI, second best is MIS, last is QI. The reason is that you have to look at specific turns of events. QI is great if he plays ENACTORY next turn, because it lets you bingo. But he presumably won't, and so you just end up with more tiles to play through. MIS scores the most points and sets up some outs next turn; however, it turns out that MI sets up two specific nice outs - if you draw an R you get IRONERS in two spots (MIS blocks the second spot) and if you draw the T you get ENTERONS, which isn't really blockable. So in this case, you shouldn't take the points with MIS because of the plays ENORS allows next turn.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?AAOORT 10J RATO +12 338
#note Sam went over by 3 minutes.
>Magrathean: ENORY 11H OYER +22 407
#note ROTA would've prevented this play.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?AO F9 .As +24 362
#note actually his best play. Not that it really matters, but well-spotted, Sam.
