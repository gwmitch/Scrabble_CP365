#note Chris challenged instantly, because he recognized the real seven in those tiles.  Unfortunately, I did not know the word, but something in my head was telling me that there was a word in there.  I have a feeling that the rack came up on Jumble Time before, and osmolic* was probably my guess then too.

#note Chris did not see a way to make a play that didn't give me a bingo in response, so he took the points.
>Dave_Koenig: CILMOOS 7F MOO +18 18
#note Ugh.  I missed COLORISM/MISCOLOR.  That hurts a lot more than the previous error, because I did know both words.

#note It's either this or the fisherman's play of LI 9C.  They're virtually dead even in a sim.

#note Sim likes QUARE a hair better than this, but given the 48 point deficit, I strongly prefer playing this way.  In an even game, I might do QUARE.

#note Immediately after this play I heard Chris muttering to himself about how dumb he was.  I assumed it was because he could have played HABIT in the same spot.

#note This is an important moment to recognize that you *can't* just go by sim results in judging moves.  My chances of winning this game are very poor, and the board is not conducive to bingos, except on row 14, where Chris is likely to get comeback plays that score nearly as much as my bingos.  I knew immediately that HAND would be the best equity play, but I strongly prefer my way of playing it.  I keep a better bingo leave and make the board much more volatile, both by creating new openings and leaving the 15L-15O opening.  I also turn over an extra tile to try to get to those blanks sooner.

#note Chris outthunk* himself on this play.  As he was quick to admit immediately after the game, it is a terrible move which might put the game in jeopardy.  The explanation is that he thought there was only one A left unseen to him so that I could not bingo, so he was trying to rack up the spread.  As the letters actually fell, I have three possible bingos, GIARDIA(S), GRAVIDA(S), and DIAGRAPH to the H.  The obvious and safe thing to do is to play HAUL or HULA 1L killing the bingo lines.  For some reason Quackle's sim has these plays winning only about 99.8% of the time, but I can't figure out how he would possibly lose after them.  There is a better way to play with fire that allows him to rack up more spread while still guaranteeing a win.  That play is UM F2, after which he will always draw a bingo that will fit on both row 1 and column O.
>Dave_Koenig: ADGIPRV G2 P. +4 335
#note I was 100% sure that Chris had the blank based on his previous move, but I still had a chance to grab one of the remaining A's for GRAVIDA(S) in two places.  Turns out the last two letters in the bag were AI, but Chris grabbed the A before I could.  If I had gotten the A, he would have just barely hung on for the win.
