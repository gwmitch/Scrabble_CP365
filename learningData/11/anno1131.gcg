#note A small but significant inaccuracy.  DAIMYO is best.  MYOID 1.3 back.  ATOMY 2.5 back.

#note Best.

#note 3.3 points behind NIDING, which I didn't see.  I might not have been sure of the word, even if I did see it.

#note NAVAID.  This is a huge error, but maybe an instructive one.  When you have one of these Noah's ark racks, it's easy to think that your rack just sucks and not expect to find a big play.  I have no doubt that I didn't think about this play for very long.  I saw I had a simple 30 point play that cleared out all the duplicates and settled for it without examining closely for something better.  As Emanuel Lasker said, "When you find a good move, look for a better one."

#note I go on a good run here and make best plays on this and the next three moves.  But don't worry.  I'll start stinking up the joint again before the game is over.

#note I'm not thrilled about what this does to the board, but I'm still relatively close in score, and I need to clear this junk out of my rack quickly.

>Dave_Koenig: ?DJLMOP 7E J.MP +22 222
#note JO/JINK sims about even with this.  The leave is consonant heavy but has good synergy.  I like keeping row 6 and column I open, but the problem is that bingos I can draw are unlikely to fit on this board.

#note RONDELLE.  A horrendous miss, especially because that's a rack that I'd practiced several times shortly before the tournament.  After this, despite hitting a bingo and pulling the second blank, there's not enough game left to catch up.

#note Jere pointed out to me after the game that I can spell ASSHOLE with this rack, which is an apt description of what I played like.
