>Magrathean: AACEIOV 5D A.OIC +16 36
#note this is the kind of position I'm consistenly bad at. the V is still awful
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: BDEILPR 6D B.P +27 63
#note quackle also likes BLIP 4a, but I wouldn't open the triple lane like that for a slightly better leave and 3 extra points.

#note the first of a couple of moves which felt unproductive, though there was not much better to do. with the number of Es left, EVITE is better, but takes balls to put the E out there
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ADEEIOS 1K E.ADE +27 219
>Magrathean: EEEORTT F8 .EET +17 194
#note actually a fine move, though it didn't feel like it.

#note QUIN g7 sims best, but I liked the turnover with my play.

#note luckbox move number one...
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEGKQSU 15H QUA.K +69 319
#note lucky draw.
>Magrathean: ?ACORSW M9 COWARdS +97 362
#note I am SUCH a luckbox. god.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEFSTUW N10 WET +34 353
#note a lot of things sim better than what i did here.  i think i was figuring if i didn't draw the X, i lost.... this set up lane that left a couple of possibilities for high scores, and drew attention away from the 2 line.
>Magrathean: EHINOTT O8 HINT +33 395
#note I actually think I made the right play for once! Yay! Here's my logic. Basically, the big hotspot on the board is for the X at the top left. All of my blocks are so paltry that she could easily just score to the triple. So I can either play some kind of overlap with the J, or to the triple. However, HINT is nice because it means that she has to empty the bag to make an X play, which means that I have to find an out-in-two to win, and I have an overlap play with the J as a potential high scorer. I think that's why HINt is best.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ADFGSUX 2E AX +50 403
#note jesse says -- ok...endgame time!  i add -- JUG was clearly the best idea here. I'm not sure why I dismissed it.  I saw it, but didn't want to spend time thinking about the comebacks that could end up scoring him tons more points, and he was shorter on time, and I wanted to push it while at a higher score... not really good enough reasons to not set up that second huge X spot. oh well.
>Magrathean: EEILMOT 13B OM +25 420
#note and now I screw up royally. I had five minutes to think this through, but failed nonetheless. Turns out the best play is TOE at that spot, leaving me MILE or MILTER to go out. This one allows her to block my one out and set out a high scoring one of her own. I think this move cost me like 120 bucks. Oh well.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DFGLNSU N4 LUNGS +13 416
#note luckily, can block only out play and still get points next turn. jesse had given me five minutes to look for possibilities, and leaving DIF and FUD out options should give me enough to win.
