>Quackle: EEEINNQ 8G QI +22 22
>Kelly: AAGIRRT 9E GRIT +20 20
#note My first play in two months, so of course a tricky decision. Championship Player ranks GRIT fourth, behind GAIT, TRAGI, and RAITA. I would have played RAITA had I considered it, but for some reason I didn’t, even though I saw RIATA on my rack. I preferred GRIT to GAIT because AAR plays to my word knowledge more than ARR, but I think I need to be a little more wary of vowelitis.
>Quackle: EEENNSU E9 .ENU +10 32
>Kelly: AAEEOPR 13C PEA +16 36
#note Second behind PARAE. I liked my leave better, but perhaps four points and early-game turnover is too much to give up. At least I saw the A hook!
>Quackle: EEKNRRS 7H KERN +16 48
>Kelly: ACELOOR 8K OCREA +32 68
#note Yay for newly-learned words. Those three-vowel-fives are lifesavers.
>Quackle: ?EEIIRS O8 .ERIfIES +71 119
>Kelly: ?AILOTV 14H VOLATIl. +74 142
#note Embarrassing. VIOLATE(S) is obviously the play. Perhaps I should learn how to anagram.
>Quackle: BCDDEIW H12 WI.E +42 161
>Kelly: FMMORSY L11 FOR.Y +30 172
#note Second to (C)OMFY-L8. Got too focused on playing to D15 or L15. Note to self: work on board vision.
>Quackle: ABCDDGO K10 GOB +26 187
>Kelly: AHMMOSX D10 MAX.S +52 224
#note The eternal question: should you burn your S for points. CP says no, and ranks the play second to MAX-G11. Sadly, I didn’t even consider that play, but I still probably would have taken the points. Still, that S-hook at H6 is looking like it could be vital. Scrabble is hard!
>Quackle: ACDDINR N2 CANDID.R +80 267
>Kelly: AEHMOOU 6J OOH +15 239
#note I was lost here, as proven by CP’s 11th rated play. I should admit here that I never ended up noticing the E hook at C10, so I ended up giving up a lot of points trying to open up a board that was more open than I thought. CP likes HOMO-I9, but I didn’t know the H hook. OOH-G11 looks like the play amongst ones I knew, leaving open the D at N4 for eights.
>Quackle: ELOTTVW F13 TWO +20 287
>Kelly: AAEGMNU 5K MAU. +31 270
#note A play CP likes, by a healthy margin. I’m intrigued by AGMA-5I: 4 more points and opens a new bingo lane rather than shutting one down. Yeah, AEGN is a much better leave than EUN, but what good is that if my lane down the C column is shut down next turn?
>Quackle: EHILTTV I9 HIVE +32 319
>Kelly: AAEGNNO 14B GA. +12 282
#note Here’s what happens when you’re an idiot who doesn’t notice easy E-hooks. I thought I had to do something drastic to create an opening. As setups go, this one wasn’t too shabby, with only one A and no O in the bag, but AN(N)A-4L looks like the right play here.
>Quackle: ELSTTTY 3J LYTT. +16 335
>Kelly: ABELNNO A12 BEAN +32 314
#note I really didn’t consider much else here, but maybe I should have. CP hates it, ranking it 11, preferring BEN-C9. I never would have given up 16 points and traded an E-hook for an A-hook, but patience with the setup could have yielded a huge Z or J play next turn. See, this is why I’m doing this.
>Quackle: DEENSTU C7 TUNED +17 352
>Kelly: ALLNOSZ D4 AZLON +35 349
#note I was torn between this and ZAS-6F, which CP prefers. I opted for AZLON because I thought the endgame tempo was worth giving up 5 points for; it seemed like the chance to get out in one was a better shot at winning than going up 2 points but down a turn, with the S giving me a chance to score well after possible Quackle plays from 5D. CP also prefers LA-2I. Huh? I don’t get that one at all. Damn my feeble brain!

#note The best out-play. Whoopee.
