>Brett_H: DGNORTU 5F GROUND +22 130
#note seems best although now we have two big A spots with a bunch of A's unseen.  I figure with all of my turnover, he takes one and I probably take the other on a hopefully even trade.

#note  nothing even about that.  there are 6 other bingoes, but this one is best.

#note Champ likes WATTLE.  Considered it but wasn't sure. His #2 is TOTAL@3I=22.  Mine is 3rd.

>Brett_H: AAEIOTT 11D IOTA +11 295
#note TOEA@9G=17 comes out clearly ahead of everything else.  Mine was in a dense pack hovering around  5 & 6.

>Brett_H: AEEESST G2 SEE. +17 312
#note  It was tough to pass up the 37 points from ASSET on column O, but I figured I might need to keep the S and the rack control in a near endgame considering all of the crap unseen to me.
>QWERTY: JN D10 J.N +20 320
>Brett_H: ABERSTV 2J BRAVE. +34 346
#note best.  I also considered BEV(O)R to keep my [AST] for possible O8 plays.  Most of Qs runner-up plays are one or two tiles or exchanges as well as VASTE(R) and BARTE(R) 
>QWERTY: MN H4 M.N +15 335
>Brett_H: EHOSSTU 9G HOSE +23 369
#note  A tough choice here, but I saw way too many possible 7's with the D in the 4th position for DJIN.  Any blocking would empty the bag so I figure play off some tiles and hope I draw an out play.  Keeping the S was to give me more options.  I could have drawn most of the tiles in the bag and played out whereas if I play HOSES here and keep [UT] my comeback options are reduced.  In the sim (G)HOST@F5=30 and HOSE had the same exact winning percentage throughout.  Am I missing something here that anyone cares to share?
