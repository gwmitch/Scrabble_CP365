#note Brian took a long think on this move, which was the beginning of the severe time trouble he got himself into.

#note Up to this point all my moves have been clearly best.  This is a close choice between GOPIK 2K, GOA N5, SICKOUT 3C, my play of BOCK, and KAONIC 2F.  Quack prefers GOPIK which looks odd to me.  Of course, it has a nice ACS leave, and with the S in hand, I might be able to make a good scoring play off the K.  However, it seems like I'm giving a lot up to him, when the board wasn't super open before this turn.  GOA keeps the potent CK combo, but also friendlily opens the triple line.  SICKOUT is a slick play that I might have made, if I had seen it, but I'm pretty satisfied with mine.  Quack thinks it's about 5 back of GOPIK.

#note Quack prefers AGIST 14A, but not by much.  These two plays are clearly head and shoulders above everything else.  My memory of the thought process I had at the time is foggy.  I'm not sure if I saw AGIST, but I definitely thought of making plays in that spot.  I was very concerned though, that something like AGAS would kill the board, and make comebacks very difficult.  But AGIST is not as bad, because of the new S hook it creates on row 15.  At the same time, given my already sizeable deficit on what could quickly become a blocked board, it makes sense to play fewer tiles and go more aggressively for the bingo, while keeping column B open.  Sim likes AGIST by 4.6, but it's only ahead on winning percentage 18.01% to 17.48%.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AEU L11 EAU +8 267
#note This is a nice blocking play that simultaneously takes out bingo lines on row 14 and off of the TATTING-S hook, which we were both well aware of during the game.
>Dave_Koenig: ACIOSTW M9 WAIST +33 247
#note Quackle's kibitzer doesn't even come up with this move, but it sims comparably to the duck's moves.  Sim prefers WOS 14B.  For the extra few points, it might be worth it, as the leave is good too, but again I'm really worried about what's happening to the board.  I worry that opponent will get nice scoring plays down at 15A and that my bingos won't go down.  WIST 14B might be a better version of the same idea, again to create the S hook.  It seemed to me, unless I had a really killer play on the bottom left, it was better to leave it open for two reasons: 1) I can hit bingos through the A.  2) If I let him play there first, I'm more likely to have an open line, either on row A or column 15.  Meanwhile, my play allowed for more scoring parallel plays on column N that might open up column O, e.g. H- starting words at N12, not to mention the X spot at N10.  I'm also keeping alive bingo possibilities starting at 14D and 14E.
>Brian_Cappelletto: EILM G1 LIME +26 293
>Dave_Koenig: CDEOORS H13 SOD +23 270
#note Another case where kibitzer did not come up with this move, but it sims better than every one of Quackle's moves except DOS 14B.  I prefer my move for all the same reasons as in the previous note.  I need the volatility.
>Brian_Cappelletto: ?EEIIOS 15H .EIOnISE +74 367
#note This is a really horrendous double error.  On Brian's part, for playing a phony bingo when he had a legitimate one in the same spot for the same score.  On my part, for allowing it.  I knew 100% that this word was phony, but the thought of holding or challenging never even occurred to me.  I believe he was in very severe time pressure at this point, but I didn't have that excuse.  The really strange thing about it, was that if he had played the legitimate one, it would have given me a spot for the bingo that I was staring at on my rack.
>Dave_Koenig: CEHNORV 4B CHEVR. +28 298
#note For the third turn in a row, kibitzer did not come up with my play.  But it sims better than all of Quack's plays this time.  It not only scores well, but creates a third place for a bingo line.  I'm still a huge underdog, but hold onto your hats.

>Brian_Cappelletto: EHJMRUU E10 .H +20 425
#note Brian had no time to think and not much he could do about the opening I'd just created, but he smartly realized that he had to play off just one tile, to make sure that a bingo by me did not get a million points off his rack.  However, he not so smartly overdrew here, taking both FS out of the bag, letting me give him the F and me the S.

#note FUJI is slightly better, but this is enough.  Brian finished with 6 seconds left on his clock.  If he had gone over, the game would have been a tie.  In his rush, he had also accidentally underscored a few plays, and he ended up picking up four extra points in the recount.
