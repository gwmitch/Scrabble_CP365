#note CP likes AH-6E best, which I don’t get because of the II leave. Close behind is HIM in the same spot, which makes more sense to me. The only bingo, AMID(S)HIP-K1, comes in third. My play sucked. Apparently, I should be keeping as much of a good rack together as possible, as MID finished a full percent ahead despite giving up a point.

#note The best of the non-bingoes. eARTH(N)UT comes out best, but let’s face it, I’m not good enough to come up with that yet.

#note Again, best if you don’t know the bingo (R)OTIFORm.

#note I really liked this play, but CP wants me to play GRAY-4A or even GR(A)Y-15A, keeping AAAR in exchange for a few points and taking out a hotspot.

#note Sigh indeed. CP hates it, preferring (COZY)ING or (SI)GHING. Something I wasn’t considering but should have been was that the Q is still out, but I’d have to draw it and have Enrico bingo along row 1 to be in big trouble. I’m sure that won’t happen.

#note Damn you, Enrico!
>Kelly: EGLNPQV 12F V.G +14 377
#note Mailing it in and missing that I could, in fact, dump the Q. Regardless, the best play is GL(Y)P(H)-J11.
