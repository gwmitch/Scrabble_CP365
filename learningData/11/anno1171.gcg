#note CP gives the 8F placement a .02 percent edge. Someone’s going to have to explain this one to me.

#note I was doing pretty well up to here, then I go and miss a routine bingo I’ve known for years. WTF?

>Kelly: AELLMNT A12 .LAM +24 243
#note (C)ELL looks better, with all those E’s still in the bag. Besides, L’s suck. Also, I could have played (C)ALM and not placed the A next to a DWS.

#note Second to (P)ELE-E4. I’m unconvinced. Anyway, while I was deciding on my play, I became certain that the duck was going to bingo next turn. Don’t ask me how I knew; it just turned over 6 tiles, for goodness sake, but I knew.

>Kelly: DEEIILT 12L .IE +4 266
#note Maybe this was somewhat desperate, but I was fearful that a play along row 3 could shut everything down. CP doesn’t suggest anything better that creates a new opening, so I don’t know what I should have done here.

#note CP thinks my best shot is to forgo the bingo this turn, grab 30 points with VI(CAR)-H1, and take my chances with AERST. Gutsy, but I like it, since the bingo now leaves me down a tempo in the endgame.
