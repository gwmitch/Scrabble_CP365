>Kelly: AADISUW 8G WADI +16 16
#note I preferred this placement because I’m holding an S, but, as usual, CP disagrees with me, giving 8E a .7% edge.
>Quackle: BEMNNOR 9F NOMEN +25 25
>Kelly: AEIOSTU 10E IOTA +21 37
>Quackle: BBEIRTT H8 ...RETTI +33 58
>Kelly: EFIJLSU 14F JU. +26 63
#note Slightly ahead of FUJIS-K4.
>Quackle: ?AABBGI D10 BABA +23 81
>Kelly: EEFILST K2 LEFTIES +79 142
>Quackle: ?AGIRRS 3F GRAIn.RS +70 151
>Kelly: EOOUVVY H1 OV. +18 160
#note A percentage point ahead of YO(R)E-L1.
>Quackle: DGHNNOY J6 HY..G +42 193
>Kelly: EOTTUVY 14F ...TY +23 183
#note Second best. This time YORE is the play.
>Quackle: DINNNOW 11C W.ND +24 217
>Kelly: EEOTUUV F1 VO.UE +11 194
#note Just ahead of a slew of different exchanges.
>Quackle: ?EIINNO M3 .INfONIE +59 276
>Kelly: CEHITUX N10 XU +50 244
>Quackle: AADEGOS 6C GOAD +25 301
>Kelly: ACEHIMT O11 MATCH +43 287
#note Saw the nongo HEMATIC, but didn’t know HAEMIC or HEMIC-L10, which is frustrating, since I was looking for plays there. MICHE is the best O11 play, but didn’t know that one either. Note to self: learn some words.
>Quackle: ADEEQRS 13M QA. +24 325
>Kelly: EEEFILZ 5E Z.E +46 333
#note CP strongly prefers ZEE at C13. I was willing to keep the doubled E for defense, and I’m not convinced this was the wrong decision.
>Quackle: DEENORS F14 .O +9 334
#note Speedy’s biggest weakness: fishing on closed boards.
>Kelly: EEFIKLR L10 KEF +34 367
#note Playing with fire by leaving a lane open with Quackle fishing, but I thought the points outweighed the chances the duck would bingo through the G.
>Quackle: CDEENRS I6 CE.. +23 357
>Kelly: EEILLRU C3 LIE.E +14 381
#note Okay, I’ve got a lead, now it’s time to take out the C-column. CP suggests better ways to do it are LI(G)URE, LU(G)ER, and RE(G)ULI.
>Quackle: ADENPRS E5 ..P +14 371
>Kelly: LLOPRSU K11 POL +23 404
#note CP likes (OVA)LS, but rates POL as the other 100% win. I briefly toyed around with O(I)-4B, but it’s too easy to block my plays to the triples.
>Quackle: ADEINRS C11 .AND +24 395
>Kelly: LRRSU 14A UR.S +19 423
#note Hey, I won one!
>Quackle: EIRS 8A RISE +22 417
