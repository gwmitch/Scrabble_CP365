#note I don't want to get caught up fishing. (KI)RN is too cute, I hate gambles like that. (KI)R was considered, but this board isn't too friendly to bingos except for the one that sets up. 
>Wes_Eddings: DEHIT M3 DITHE. +36 137
#note He spends over 10 minutes on this turn, he's got 9 left. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEILOR O1 DARIOLE. +80 195
>Wes_Eddings: UU -UU +0 137
#note He spends another 4 minutes here before trading 2. He's down to 5. 
>Matt_Canik: AELNNOR E10 NO +10 205
#note This is in arrempts to disrupt potential bingos of his. The plan is to make him open something up and bingo in his spot. 
>Wes_Eddings: C 7J C... +6 143
>Matt_Canik: AEEFLNR N1 EF +23 228
#note I'm playing as fast as I can now to push his time further. He looks very panicky. 
>Wes_Eddings: AN C12 AN +7 150
>Matt_Canik: AAELNRT 10C L..A +6 234
#note This one was really worrisome. Bingos in the B column or 14 row could both really hurt. I just disrupt what I can, hoping that if he *does* bingo, I hit him back with my own on the TWS for more. 
>Wes_Eddings: O 12C ..O +7 157
#note Lol.
>Matt_Canik: AEENRST 12I EASTERN +78 312
#note I think about playing in the 13 or 14 rows to disrupt as much as I can, but I just took the points, there are still lines in the 2 and 3 rows. E(YEW)ATERS is cool, but a terrible play.
