#note POILU is simming 1 better. I debated between these two plays, and finally decided the 6 points outweighed the leave difference.
>Ed_De_Guzman: IKNR D11 KIRN +22 130
>dacrON: AACIOUY 14B YO.IC +32 185
#note Played this super fast. Didn't think of A(L)IYA which is 3 better. I think I'd have played YO(N)IC still though, given how my decision making had been this tournament.
>Ed_De_Guzman: AZ 10N ZA +64 194
#note Was hoping I'd have a chance to block it.
>dacrON: AAFIOTU 15A OAF +28 213
#note Sims five behind AFOU(L). I thought he has an S with KIR, and felt that spot was more dangerous. I considered AFOU(L), but missed OAF for 32. at M12.
>Ed_De_Guzman: ESV 11C S..VE +12 206
>dacrON: ABEILTU 15H TUBA. +21 234
#note I AM SO BAD. I thought I was making up BALLUTE/ BULLATE. I put BULLITE* down and looked at it for 3 minutes before deciding on this, because I thought he was representing a very strong rack, which could be neutralized by blocking the SKIVE hooks. Turns out Ed would've let BULLITE* go. TABU(L)I would've been so much better - got too focused on other plays. BALLUTE/BULLATE are 4.5 better than this.
>Ed_De_Guzman: ACOORSS M11 COO +25 231
>dacrON: AEEGILU 7G AGILE +19 253
#note FINALLY A CORRECT PLAY (imo).
>Ed_De_Guzman: ADHR 6I HARD +23 254
>dacrON: EGNSUUY 5E GENUS +20 273
#note Right to block the S hook here, but I spaced on UNGUES which is a HUGE mistake.
>Ed_De_Guzman: BESW M3 WEBS +27 281
>dacrON: AEINRUY L1 YEAR +31 304
#note Running low n time here, and I again space on the best play. YUAN is automatic. This play either lost me the game, or actually gave me the shot at the tie, given what I drew.
>Ed_De_Guzman: EENV N2 NEVE +30 311
>dacrON: EEIINTU O10 .UNTIE +21 325
#note UNIT(Y) apparently wins about 2% more. *shrug* is it better?
>Ed_De_Guzman: ?STX 1H SiXT. +42 353
