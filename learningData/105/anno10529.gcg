>Joey: CDFIJLO F5 FJO.D +32 66
#note I didn't know FJORDIC.  That would have worked out a lot better.

#note ADROITER would play on a Collins board, but that does me no good here.  BEACONED is noteworthy, but I wanted to take this spot while I could.

#note I wanted to block plays like HALVA O1, as well as VAULTING, even though I saw THULIAS as a possibility.  That could be missed more easily.

#note Fortunately for me, VIRTUAL and VICTUAL also got missed.  These games are hard.
