>Jim_Burlant: ADEENRT 8G DE +6 6
#note Sometimes it sucks to go first.  Anyway - the play, depending on your style preference, is either this or exchange N; this sims roughly 3/4% and 1 point down on exchange N.  For this game, ED woould probably have been much better.
>Paul_Holser: EINZ I7 ZEIN +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: AEHNRTT J6 HAT +30 36
#note Any number of choices.  Q prefers that I play the whole rack with J6 HATTER for 41.  I considered it, but liked the ENRT leave too much and liked my bingo chances enough that I thought 30 followed by a  bingo was better than 40 followed by a random rack.  In retrospect it was a bit short sighted of me, as there are so many front hooks to HAT (I only thought of the T, and forgot about all the other front hooks at large in the pooll) that this could be giving back way more than I get.  Championship player indicates its displeasure with this play, and with good reason.  Fortunately for me, I don't get burned.  
>Paul_Holser: BOP K5 BOP +33 61
>Jim_Burlant: EHLNNRT L3 THEN +24 60
#note Best, and I'm 40% to win.
>Paul_Holser: ?EEIINR 3F REIgNI.E +66 127
#note Or RETINITE, or REINVITE or REINCITE.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DELNRS 11C DaRNELS +78 138
#note Numerous options, and 11C is the best placement.  Other choices: LaNDERS, RoNDELS, LeNDERS, ReLENDS, etc.  Still treading water, at 46%.
>Paul_Holser: AEVW H1 WA.VE +45 172
>Jim_Burlant: GJLNORU D8 JUG.L +40 178
#note Or JOUAL; stylistic preference as to whether you prefer opening up the S hook and/or leaving yourself RNG instead of NOR. I prefer not giving up the easy S hook while simultaneously keeping a vowel. Still treading water; I've been 45% or thereabouts to win since the second turn, and nothing's changed.
>Paul_Holser: ADIRUUX N1 RADIX +35 207
#note Post-mortem Paul told me this was his rack.  Q says he should just dump the U's cheap with ULU H10.
>Jim_Burlant: IINNORT O4 NITRO +30 208
#note Three plays stand out at the top of the sim, and even after 1000+ iterations, the sim is still toggling between them.  1L NORI, INRO, and this choice are the 3.  I saw the 30 points and felt I had to stay in the game.
>Paul_Holser: COUUY 1L CO.Y +36 243
#note Then again, does he get 36 points if I play NORI on the previous turn?
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOP H10 A.PINE +35 243
#note Spent a couple of minutes figuring out for myself what Quackle confirms with a click of the "Generate Choices" button:  this is my second no-go in as many games.  I almost put down E5 CAPO, which is almost as strong in the sim's eyes.  I saw the points for this and felt I couldn't pass them up.  Q agrees; this is best, with CAPO a strong second.
>Paul_Holser: EKOUY F1 EU.OKY +23 266
>Jim_Burlant: AACGOOR 5B CROA. +22 265
#note Q likes E6 AGO; not sure why I missed that or 1A AGORAE, which would have been better.  AGO wins 34%' this wins 29.
>Paul_Holser: AEIIMTU 14F MI.UTIAE +68 334
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV 1A GAVOT. +33 298
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV --  -33 265
#note My second no-go in 3 turns and my 3rd in two games.  Small consolation:  LOVAGE 1A (the play I couldn't think of, which is best) barely wins 7%, and that's against a random rack.  Against his post-bingo rack of ABDFFLS (Paul told me this after the game) it doesn't even win 5.
>Paul_Holser: ABDFFLS 1A BAFFL. +54 388
#note Had I played the legitimate play of LOVAGE 1A, Paul was going to play BAFFLE M9 for 34, giving him a 70-point lead and leaving DS in his rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV N8 GAVOT +20 285
#note Missing LOVAGE again.
>Paul_Holser: DIOST O11 DOITS +27 415

>Paul_Holser: OS G7 O.S +23 463
#note Prior to losing the turn on GAVOTE*, HAT and CROAK were the only real mistakes I'd made this game.  I didn't get burned with a huge row 5 play after HAT (the main liability of that play), and given that the V was one of the first 2 tiles out of the bag on my replenish from CROAK, quackle's preferred play of AGO E6 would not have yielded a bingo rack, so CROAK didn't really hurt me.  So, back to the VOLTAGE rack:  even if I score 33 with LOVAGE, Paul comes back with BAFFLE for 34.   I'm down 70, he possesses all the hooks for 15M.  Best case for me, even if I draw something like SUQ to play at 15M in a post-LOVAGE rack, I'm still down 19 and he has a turn and a reasonable chance of leading by 50 after his next turn, at which point we're in the end game.  Suffice it to say, MINUTIAE clinched the game for him.  Just like the previous game, outside of a couple of equity slips that could have gone either way, the only real screwups came after the game was already decided.
