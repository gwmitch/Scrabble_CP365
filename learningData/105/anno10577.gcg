#note I see IRO(N)IES for 28, but I liked OI better, EIIRS seemed like a decent leave to me. Quackle hates me.

#note I thought about WIG setting up some sort of SWIG and some SH- word.

>Matt_Canik: ACGNSST B2 C.AGS +20 99
#note I like this because it sets up the front hook. This sims best after a quick sim. 
>Doug_Riblet: QT F2 Q.T +32 202
#note Is he just gonna score free points every turn? 
>Matt_Canik: ANOOSTU C11 AUTO +19 118
#note I was really angry going into this turn, after I played CRAGS I was thinking pessimistically in my head 'damnit I bet he plays QAT now' and then he did. This sets up another S hook, which I like, but TAUON A4 scores 7 more.

>Matt_Canik: EFNOOSS 15A EFS +23 141
#note This is inexcusible. I knew I was going to mess up bad, and, well, I did. (U)N(R)OOF is nice, FOSSE is nice. I knew FOSSA but not FOSSE. I don't really know what I am even trying to accomplish with this play. I literally spent 8 minutes looking at the board, then realized I hadn't done anything for 8 minutes and just played this.

#note HADJ 13L is also an option, but likely gives up a play along the 14 row.

>Matt_Canik: ACHINOR K6 CORIAN.H +76 339
#note I have no idea why I thought this was a word. I thought initially it was is pokemon, but it's not. So now I just don't know. Maybe it's from a video game? Maybe it's some ancient civilizaiton? (I know that's CORINTH, nvm)
