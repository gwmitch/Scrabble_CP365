#note I missed FLOWN/POWN#.  This is a textbook example of my newishness# at Collins.  I know the word POWN, but I'm not used to thinking about the hook yet.  Quackle likes VOW also, but I'd rather play off an extra consonant.

#note I think I rushed here and didn't realize how many tiles I would be leaving myself with, but playing short to avoid emptying the bag doesn't look that hopeful here.  There's no chance to get bingos down, and I need the points.  I didn't spot ESCAR, which might give me a better chance, but it's looking bleak in any case.
>Bob_Lipton: EGGLTUU D8 GUL.. +14 396
#note Bob played this quickly, which surprised me.  I think he was somewhat short of time, but not desperately so.  He should have played GJU# which wins handily.  It threatens an out of GLUTEI G1.  He wins many other ways too.  After this, he should still win if he spots GJU, but it's much hairier.
>Dave_Koenig: DEIRST 8A DIR.E +21 399
#note I had around 5 minutes left, so no time excuses.  I didn't see GJU and thought that if I made a decent scoring out in two I had a chance to come back.  The best I could see was RIDGE/DIRGE, but which one to play?  I didn't think he was going out, but I was afraid he might play some CSW 5 that I didn't know.  I thought there was more likely to be a 5 with the R than the D, so I decided to play it this way instead of the other just to make the R harder to use.  (For example, what if guert* was a word?)  But in so doing I set up an easy high scoring play for him.
>Bob_Lipton: EGTU C7 U.GE +25 421
#note Almost immediately after I pressed my clock, I was kicking myself for allowing this.  It turns out that even if I had played RIDGE, Bob can still win with GJU, but he has to find it.  I made it too easy on him.
