#note Probably getting too cute here, but the play/trade 3 then bingo occurence were too salient here (think Sam K game last round). So maybe I overcompensated by trying to set up my J. This is 5 worse, which I feel is a bit harsh, given that IMORV isn't exactly special, especially if I don't hit an E.

#note I know Quackle penalizes me for this, but I do like the control it offers - fits right into my playbook. OKA at I2 is definitely a good play, but I just love getting rid of the awkward FEUDS hook.

#note Could save the blank, but how often am I not going to get ZA next turn? Figure the blanks is scoring 84 over two turns, and this play makes a lot more sense.

#note Quackle says forking the board with US(A)GE is best. This is likely because she will bingo fairly often, so I may as well take the points (also this forces her to make an 8).

#note Just couldn't pull the trigger. :( Fortunately, the next round tie bailed me out of this (for the time being...?)
