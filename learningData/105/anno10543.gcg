#note Quackle likes DON 9F a fair bit better. I'm not entirely sure I understand why.

#note Quackle seems unable to know what the best thing to do here is. I'm not really sure either.
>Mike: AAAFITU 15H .AFIA +9 351
#note So I've drawn 3 Es, then 3 As, then 3 Is...and I'm somehow still a favorite. Just not with this play. Any of FA G13 (considered it), TUFAS 14D (didn't), FAJITA E9 (didn't even see), or AA G13 (!) wins 5/8 endgames, losing only to TELEPORT. This apparently wins only 3/8, and the key to the position (as will be seen) is that, *no matter what I do*, if an E is in the bag I'm dead. Thus, I need to focus on winning the other five cases. It's tough not to play TAFIA in this spot, but I guess I'm not supposed to.

#note (S)PELTER is 10 better - I didn't realize it still fit.
>Mike: AETU A12 .EAT +18 369
#note TAUPE, of course, but this is only three back. I figured I'd give him one more chance to make a (infinitesmally unlikely) mistake.
