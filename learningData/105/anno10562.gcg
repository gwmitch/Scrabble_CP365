#note INCUBI is a tough find.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AAEGLPR D4 PARA.LE +22 22
#note i was absolutely aware that this would sim badly, but i honestly did not like my rack if i didn't get an S, and conrad doesn't play wide open so i thought i'd give myself a better shot blowing up the board on the first move. the best play would normally be GAP. (-8)

>Cesar_Del_Solar: DDGGNRX 2A DR.G +12 34
#note this sucks, i lost this scoresheet, but this move was a point of minor contention after i told conrad i had 7 consonants. i guaranteed him this would sim best; i think these were my 7 consonants, but i did sim this right after the game and it came within 0.5 points of exchanging. i don't actually know how to play scrabble, but i have a decent intuition for how well plays will sim most of the time, and trying to emulate quackle exactly will probably do for now.

>Cesar_Del_Solar: IX 2F XI +52 86
#note the i was my only vowel but this was clearly best

>Cesar_Del_Solar: ADGNNRT 5C ..DNAG +20 106
#note the A was my only vowel. i think this was my exact rack. pant is probably better?

#note nice and lucky
>dacrON: AEEFITV L1 VE.ITE +26 177
#note This sims best, but I don't mind F(O)VEATE or F(O)VEAE either
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EOOSSTY J8 SOY +25 215
#note not 100% sure on this but i remember thinking of TOYO and SOOEY so these were probably my tiles.
>dacrON: AEFIKOU 12A KO.AI +28 205
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEIORST G7 O.ERIEST +61 276
#note i actually almost missed this, i thought of SEROTINE* for some reason. my heart was racing at this point and i was more trying to figure out a way to calm down. for some reason i thought i could be playing for the tournament next round, but i was a game further back. eventually i relaxed and found the bingo.
>dacrON: EEFISUW 1L .IEW +30 235
#note Sims even with (K)UFI. I like how (V)IEW leaves the K alone as a potential spot, as well as the fact that I have good Q insurance.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: GHHJNQR B11 H.NG +23 299
#note and two other consonants. (GHJNQ are for sure, and i am almost positive i had another H because i remember thinking of HIGH). this move could be considered an insane move by most people. again, i decided to go against my gut and go for the quackle sim winner. i wish i could explain my logic here, but it goes something like "my average score over the next couple of turns subtracted from his average score will be slightly higher than if i exchange". besides, i have two high point tiles and he's more likely to want to go for a bingo and thus less likely to draw the Z right now.
>dacrON: ?EFOSUZ K9 FEZ +40 275
#note Is FU(T)Z worth the 8 point sacrifice? It seems close...
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?EHJMQR 7C J.M +24 323
#note equity again, although K2 HOMER ends up almost even. i think i like it better. 
>dacrON: ?LNOSUY M6 SOUNdLY +63 338
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?EHILQR 15A QI +42 365
#note i'm pretty sure my last tile was an L. i would have had QUID if it was a D. QI E11 would have to be best. i think i was worried about screwing up the endgame if i did this.
>dacrON: ADNOTUW L12 AUTO +20 358
#note No wins here.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?DEHLLR 8L H.LL +33 398
#note Blocking my big out is best, but he is still OK. (Cesar: I AM TERRIBLE, -15)
>dacrON: DNW 2K W.ND +30 388
#note i didn't tell this to conrad but sometime while he was thinking of AUTO i turned off my brain to tell myself i had already won and i could relax. maybe i need to go on some sort of valium-like substance because i was seriously absurdly nervous, my heart was pounding out of my chest. of course when WEND goes down i thought OH SHIT. i would have normally seen it. hopefully i can learn to chill in the future now that my rating doesn't suck. luckily i was much more relaxed for the final game, but i screwed that one up royally in other ways.
>dacrON:  (?DER) +8 396
#note 3 more points and I'd be playing for first. Heartbreaking.
