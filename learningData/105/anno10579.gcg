>lordlivgon: EIMOSWX H3 OXIMES +46 46
#note The much cooler EXOMIS is also available for the same score. It does not sim as well though.
>iPod_Hard_AI: ADGI I1 GADI +22 22
>lordlivgon: DDISTUW G7 WUD +24 70
#note Definitely far and away the best move. Leave of DIST is also not bad.
>iPod_Hard_AI: ?AAINRT 6H .ARINATe +63 85
#note A play of AeRATING from B1 is much superior as it not only scores better but doesn't open the triple lane in such a blatant fashion, which the AI will regret on my next move.
>lordlivgon: ADFFIST O1 DAFFI.ST +212 282
#note The rack itself contains the seven DISTAFF (which I failed to spot). However, the AI obligingly floated an E out in the correct position in the triple lane for me to put this monster down. 
>iPod_Hard_AI: EEINORR 1F ERI.ERON +80 165
>lordlivgon: CELOOQW F6 COW +26 308
#note I preferred a move at this hotspot compared to Q(I) K5 because dumping the Q scored less and it was very unlikely that I would bingo on the next turn even if I dumped the Q given a leave of CELOOW. Furthermore, there are multiple Q-dump spots available (and so I would not be stuck with the Q even if my draw was bad). Lastly, not playing off the Q gave the chance that I would draw more favourable tiles and play the Q for more points. Quackle does sim a variety of moves on the F coloumn as better (e.g. F6 LOWE or F6 WOO) but I played COW because it scored the highest.
>iPod_Hard_AI: ?BIOORT M6 .BORTIOn +76 241
>lordlivgon: AEELOQU 10J QUO.E +36 344
#note I considered QUELEA as a possible play but only saw 2A as a spot where I could put it down. I believed my move to be better as it retained AEL (good vowels + a consonant) while scoring the same and not opening the triple so blatantly. However, I completely missed 10F QUELEA forming WUDU, which is definitely the best move here.
>iPod_Hard_AI: AGGIO 6A AGOGI. +14 255
>lordlivgon: AEELLSY J1 .YE +31 375
#note Once again, Quackle does not like my move, preferring O10 SALLEE, O10 SELLAE or L12 YALE. I admit that YALE is better but I do not like using an S for only 5 extra points and retaining the awkward Y (as is the case in the other two moves).
>iPod_Hard_AI: ACETV A3 VAC.TE +36 291
>lordlivgon: AELLNRS E5 N.L +13 388
#note A bad move here; I failed to see both D3 LANGRELS and 12G LLANEROS. My move sims behind both bingos and 4D RELAXIN in terms of equity.
>iPod_Hard_AI: MPUY L12 PUMY +39 330
>lordlivgon: AEEILRS B8 EARLIES +70 458
#note An obvious bingo; however I missed D6 GASELIER.
>iPod_Hard_AI: OZ N2 ZO +49 379
>lordlivgon: BDELLNP 12A B.NDLE +24 482
#note 2B BLEND is very much superior. Another mistake.
>iPod_Hard_AI: EEV 15L .EVE +30 409
>lordlivgon: EHLNPTU 2B UNETH +45 527
#note Definitely the best move; scores far above anything else.
>iPod_Hard_AI: AHK 4L KHA. +40 449
>lordlivgon: AJLNP D1 J.AN +38 565
#note Again, the highest scoring move; although by this point I have clearly won and am just mopping up.
>iPod_Hard_AI: IRST O10 RIT +19 468
>lordlivgon: LP K9 P.L +10 575
#note Overall, my opponent had both the blanks, an S and KZ, while I came away with three esses and the JQX. Luck slightly weighted towards opponent, also I did make some mistakes in the closing stages of the game, explaining the (relative) closeness of the margin (given that I had a nine-timer).
>lordlivgon:  (S) +2 577
