#note weird draw! twiddles is a better play.

#note Didn't see UNZIP 6H or BENZIN 4G.
>Jesse: BEHLORY A11 HERBY +50 210
>Mike: BEINNPU D2 NUB +18 189
#note UNBE sims as a slight improvement, but with six Es already gone, I figured it was worth hanging on to.
>Jesse: EGLNOTY A1 GENTLY +38 248
#note I'm really surprised I would miss the bingo here.
>Mike: DEIKNPT 2G P.NK +20 209
#note It's not like the board is super wide-open at this point, and KIP G2 closes down more lanes than it opens. So why is it winning the sim handily? Is DENT that much better than DEIT?
>Jesse: DEORRSU K2 ORDURES +77 325
>Mike: DDEEIOT F8 .O.IED +22 231
#note Or BODIED 14A. Nothing is better than 3% here.

#note You know, I thought this would get me back over 1%. I mean, if the S is in the bag, I should have a pretty decent chance to get...something.
>Jesse: AIMPSTU 15L PAMS +63 485
#note PITS and then ARUM is my best sequence.
