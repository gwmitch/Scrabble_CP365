#note Doh#!  I missed COURANTO!
>Randy_Hersom: QT 6D Q.T +14 56
#note Here I saw that his play blocked two bingos, OVERTONE and AEROTONE#.

#note I seriously considered REFINER for 9 more points, but Quackle agrees with my choice here.  Early in the game it makes more sense to play aggressively for leave, while bingos can still fit on the board.  Also REFINER gives a lot back to him at A15.
>Randy_Hersom: ?AEFIIP B5 APE.ItIF +68 152
#note A pretty find, when he did not have a lot of bingos.  However, PACIFIER B1 scores 10 more.  It's definitely worth taking those points despite the slightly worse defense.

>Dave_Koenig: AEEKNOR 13K KENO +29 181
#note This is definitely better than KEENO# in the same spot, because it doesn't slot the O at O13 and holds the E for the YOKE hook.

#note A tough situation here.  UNSOLID does not quite fit on either column L or N.  Meanwhile, I need to score enough that I will still be within bingo range on the next turn.  I thought about UNLID#, but I had no idea whether it was a word.  Objectively, it's better of course, but this one actually turned out better for me.
>Randy_Hersom: ALRTW O4 TRAWL +38 396
#note I believe Randy may have already been holding the blank here, and the idea of me hitting a bingo is very unexpected.  Still, WELT 8L leaving one in the bag was probably more circumspect.
>Dave_Koenig: ABHIINU 3C BAUHINI. +80 399
#note Wow!  Talk about a lucky break!
