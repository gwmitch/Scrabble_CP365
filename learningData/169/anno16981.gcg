>joshua_sokol: BEFIIRY 9E REIF +19 19
#note Hmm, 9G IF is something I should have considered, as is I5 BEI(G)Y. This was to set up REIFY next turn, but as you will see, I whiffed on BEI(G)Y twice in a row, and it was more costly the second time. I really hated BRIEF 9D mainly because of its leave, but maybe it's still the right play.
>michael_fagen: ?BEINOR E4 aIRBO.NE +86 100
#note bleh, already not going well!
>joshua_sokol: ABEEIIY I8 .YBE +29 48
#note Bleeding a ton of equity, some would say, and they would be right. Not only is BEI(G)Y 2 points better, its volatility is lesser, and not only is its volatility lesser, the fact that I kept II instead of I costs me over 10 points in terms of leave alone! I need to see BEIGY next time, and I think I will.
>michael_fagen: DEOTX H11 DETOX +45 145
#note but then again, this would have been 17 more points had I played BEIGY! Weird how these things turn out. I'm not going to lie and say I had one of my premonitions, by the way...
>joshua_sokol: AEIISWY J10 YEA +33 81
#note some weird choices to make this turn. Do I chance that Michael doesn't know/doesn't see A(WEARY) and go for 27 at 6B? Do I burn my S and play YWIS for 40 at J10? YEW, same spot? I considered WI(R)Y but the only thing I am a little likely to bingo through next turn is the T in DETOX... I think this play was a mistake, as I also considered what it gave back.
>michael_fagen: EPTW K9 WEPT +42 187
#note I guess this is still a pretty bad scenario but still
>joshua_sokol: EGIISSW 8K SWIGS +49 130
#note I considered just SWIG, but I didn't feel that powerless yet.
>michael_fagen: AANO D1 ANOA +12 199
#note not sure why this was played here rather than at 10D. I think Michael was either still scared of the Z(A) bomb or he just missed the other placement
>joshua_sokol: AEEILLV 15F VE.ILLAE +69 199
#note jumped on this because it was possible that it was good in my mind, but also cause I think it was a good idea to play it even if it was phony, which it is
>michael_fagen: FNU C1 FUN +23 222
>joshua_sokol: AADHORV B2 HOARD +41 240
#note are the tables turning?
>michael_fagen: EITU A6 ETUI +15 237
#note seems so!
>joshua_sokol: AINORRV D10 ARVO +18 258
#note N6 VI(G)OR seems really good if I would rather play defense, which I should, although he still has a juicy 7 line at 9B.
>michael_fagen: AANO 14K ANOA +14 251
#note now he sees another placement. He's complaining about how these racks refelct his luck this game, when he would be well ahead had he challenged my phony.
>joshua_sokol: DIJLNNR C13 JIN +38 296
#note I should 100% play M3 DJINN(I) if this is in fact my rack, which I'm now struggling to believe. So let's say it wasn't my rack
>michael_fagen: ADEMS 15A ME.D +27 278
#note Michael first layed down MASE* at 012, which I was eager to challenge, but then switched it to this.
>joshua_sokol: DLMNPRZ M7 Z.P +27 323
#note prospects seemed to be depleting here.
>michael_fagen: ?AEINST 1C ..NTAsIES +83 361
#note He showed me his beautiful rack before laying this down. I asked if this better reflected how he drew this game. (FA)INEAnTS looks better here
>joshua_sokol: DLMRSTU O12 MUST +32 355
#note C7 DRUM if I wish to try and bingo I guess... I don't think that's the correct route to take, but maybe I'm wrong.
>michael_fagen: IIKQRTU 10B QU..T +40 401
#note This is probably his only winning play, but I don't know his leave.
>joshua_sokol: CCDELOR 2J DOLCE +33 388
>michael_fagen: GIIKLR M1 I.K +18 419
#note he didn't see my other outs but this is the best play anyway
>joshua_sokol: CR G1 .RC +8 396
>joshua_sokol:  (GILR) +10 406
#note I wonder what would have happened if I had played BEI(G)Y! :)
