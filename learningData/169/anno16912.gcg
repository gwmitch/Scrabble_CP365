#note Tricky opener. I gave a lot of thought to SUETY and YETI. Ex TUY sims best. Overestimated the double T I guess. It's all quite close though.

#note Yuck! I decided there was a chance GILTHEAD was CSW and only ALIGHTED was ours. Bad! A case can be made for PLIGHTED, given GILTHEAD's scary S-hook and Wayne's history of challenging my weird-looking words. But it's still a pretty bad error.

#note I reasoned he wouldn't have challenged if he'd had a big play through the S. Even without the inference, this is still the best play by far.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEMRRSY K5 MERRY +33 300
#note It took me a shameful 3 minutes to challenge off FIZES*. Suddenly I'm down to 7:30 to Wayne's 19:30. And once again, I'm reasoning that he mustn't have a good play through the S. So let's not burn our rack with MESSY. But maybe I need to think ahead a few turns here. If he can't get his Z in the A column, he'll probably play there and keep his Z for a shot at 14J, which I will likely have to block unprofitably. So perhaps I should take MESSY and force him to just take ZA for 31. Or... do UNMERRY so that there are 3 big scoring spots and I have lots to choose from. I dunno. All the inferencing is for nothing, though.

#note I don't know. Am I supposed to be shortening the game here with HILI or ILIA? Yeah, definitely. Bag is vowel-lite for EEIS is a good leave. Time trouble is making me play lousy here.
