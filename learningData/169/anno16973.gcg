#note Playing too scared. Let this spot go and get the points/turnover elsewhere. MOL is a shitty defense anyway.

#note Best is (A)BIGAIL 12I. I thought about it, but didn't want to open it up that much. Too timid.

#note Interestingly enough, VAGUS N8 is the only play that guarantees a win. It's the only guaranteed out in two. I was really low on time this game, which accounts for most of my stupidity. 
>opp: ACPRTTU B1 PU. +32 411
#note This was the best play I saw for her, but CAT or CUT at 13K wins. PU(N) scores well, but there's no out play. 
>Eric: AGOV M11 V.A +12 411
#note Let me reiterate that I was low on time.... I can't play GO/JO because it gives her an out of TRACT. I briefly saw JOG, but abandoned it for some reason. I had convinced myself that I needed to play the V first, and my only guaranteed out was to keep GO. I even saw JAR and knew that this wouldn't be enough.

#note This was really a tough loss for me, especially because I was thinking at the time that JOG wins (because VA plays in many spots). However, JOG doesn't win if she plays CAT at 13K. It's possible that she wouldn't have seen that (since she missed the spot when she played PUN), but she had plenty of time to look. VIG instead of VIA wins it for me, as there are multiple spots for AO that win by a point or two. The real moral of this story is that I need to play faster, because I've been making terrible decisions when in the time crunch.
