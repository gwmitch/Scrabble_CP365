>Mike: BEIRRTX 8G REX +20 20
#note IBEX 8F appears to be a bit better. BITER 8D is an interesting idea, but I don't think Lester will overlook it.

#note Maybe just BE.

#note It's worth taking the points with TROIS or RIOTS at K5 here.

#note Forgot about BENE; LISTERS plays at K5.

#note Quackle likes AVIAN 13K for reasons I can't fathom. I'm trying to dodge the Q here, as there aren't many good homes for it on this board.
>Lester: BEEIINW 13J WEINIE +30 414
#note Phony, but I have no reason to challenge. TWEEN 8K appears to win the most, but I'm not sure emptying the bag here is wise. As the tiles lay, there's probably not a lot Lester can do here.
