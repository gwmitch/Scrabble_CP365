>Joshua_Sokol: ?GIOPTT H4 POTTInG +74 74
#note so I have to win by 12 to win club tourney
>Jason_Li: AJLNPRU 5G J.URNAL +28 28
#note real rack, what do you do? JU(G)AL looks decent
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEGORS 7E COR.EGES +63 137

>Jason_Li: ADIIPTY O8 .APIDITY +98 153
>Jason_Li: ADIIPTY --  -98 55
#note I saw he had (V)APIDITY too, so the normal thing to do in this case would have been to let it go, but I rounded up my courage and went for the challenge as this string of letters' validity would have made no sense at all
>Joshua_Sokol: IKORRTT N6 KR.IT +21 199
#note this seemed standard, but TR(A)ITOR would have been unorthodox and cool
>Jason_Li: ADIIPTY -  +0 55
#note Jason challenged KR(A)IT
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIORTU 4K UH +22 221
#note chickened out of (C)OUTHIER. It didn't look right, I'd never seen it. 
>Jason_Li: ADIIPTY 3K PAID +25 80
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIORTY 10F YO.I +16 237
#note feeling the consequences of not playing couthier. Maybe YO(G)EE here I'd say.
>Jason_Li: ITVY 11I TIVY +22 102
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEEIRT 11B EERIE +15 252
#note Jason didn't like this decision of mine. I don't know. It simming best doesn't make it the best play, but I guess it makes it not terrible. He suggested 11E TEE, which looks decent. In any case there is really no way for me to secure this board, so I need to outrun. No P left to worry about, no tiles he has that I know of, he just used IT. Meh.
>Jason_Li: ALSZ B10 Z.ALS +68 170
#note this could be why 1) Jason didn't like my play in hindsight or 2) why EERIE just wasn't a good play or 3) why EERIE was good. Lots of the top quadrant now restricted, so yeah not much to do anymore
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEFNOT 12A F.NE +28 280
#note thought the 2/1 N/T ratio made up for the probably worse leave
>Jason_Li: DDO 12L ODD +20 190
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BENOTX A14 OX +29 309
#note 2M BOX seems silly
>Jason_Li: GIM 2M MIG +22 212
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEINOT 3C BONIEsT +79 388
#note Jason questioned the validity of this word after not holding. I guess trying to convince himself that there's a way for him to win :(
>Jason_Li: CDEU 4A CUED +30 242
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNSSU A4 .ANES +21 409
#note NAN(C)E, NAN(C)ES? I of course was hoping for the Q (SUQ D2) So in that sense I guess NAN(C)ES is a good idea. The three seem close, and I'm not not blocking the 3x3
>Jason_Li: ARW 1L WAR +19 261
>Joshua_Sokol: AFHMNSU 2F HM +32 441
#note Q doesn't seem to have any good reasoning for this pre-endgame. I don't know what plays I should make, considering that if I hold the U it's because I want to draw the Q and especially still want SUQ 2D and if I don't I'm hoping Jason either drew it (3/7 chance) or I won't draw it after playing X amount of tiles, where anything more than 2 is defying probability. I guess I should play 2D HAM.
>Jason_Li: B D2 B.. +6 267
>Joshua_Sokol: AFNNQSU 12F SUQ +28 469
#note why D11 (RE)F champ? Why D10 F(RE)NA? Both defeat my play for some reason. REF for REFS/SUQ 39 I guess?
