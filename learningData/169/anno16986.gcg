#note BEADLIKE is definitely safest and I saw it right after hitting my clock.  It's just as well; I thought this would get a challenge.  Josephine holds though, but doesn't challenge.

#note Missed 4H FOREPAW.  Then again, I kind of like my play.  It limits the S hook on row 13.

#note I'm going to ignore the two plays that sim best: PRAJNA and PANZER.  It's obvious that I'm supposed to be annoying and block Josephine's bingo before she comes out of her Tasha-like stupor.  I thought I was setting up my Z with this play, but I'm not.  I should be playing this at 5J.  5J AJAR is the best play when considering that I know my opponent's rack.

>Tasha: AENNTTZ 13L .EZ +30 336
#note ANNTT is ugly but I played this because she's sitting on IRRST? She fished off the L instead of an R last turn so unless she draws another vowel, she's probaby not going to bingo next turn.  I thought of all the playable bingos she can play if she draws a vowel, and I felt that she would only bingo if she drew an O as I'm fairly sure she doesn't know the other bingos that play.  She won't play ZIT and is more likely to fish off an R or whatever other consonant she just drew.  Hopefully she drew the V. :D  So I'm pretty much guaranteed 30 points next turn with TAN and that also unduplicates my rack.

>Tasha: AINNTTV 14M TAV +36 372
#note Why am I the one that drew the V?
>Josephine_Flowers: ??IRRST 3F STRI.peR +70 216
#note O_O Did she seriously draw the other blank after fishing off one tile?  Go Josephine!  
>Tasha: CEEINNT 2A ENTICE +24 396
#note Quackle says I'm being needlessly reckless here and thinks I should be playing this at 13E instead.  This would be true if I were playing Scott, but I'm not so I deliberately played this here because I'm curious to see what she's going to do.  I saw this play as more points for me rather than a miracle comback for Josephine because Josephine plays pretty defensively and is much more likely to make errors after plays like 2A ENTICE, especially after drawing a random rack.

#note Q thinks I should be blocking the 3x3 with HERON or GENRO.   Nonsense! I'm going for the points and all the pretty tiles in the pool.
