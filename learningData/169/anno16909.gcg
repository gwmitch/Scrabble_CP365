#note IDOCRAS(E)...

>Joshua_Sokol: AAEERRV D4 REAV.. +18 89
#note I think this was my rack. AVA 7A is better.
>Joe_Neff: EFIINRT F9 .F +13 60
#note from Joe - I missed FERRITIN
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEORRU I5 ROU. +7 96
#note I can't really block this setup, and this might be my rack, so I think going for points is much more important than playing ROUP here...

#note Well crap... I seriously missed JOLTERS?

>Joshua_Sokol: ELMORST 12G MERLOTS +77 240
#note I saw MOLTERS at least...
>Joe_Neff: EEGNOTU 5C G.NU +21 251
#note from Joe - or TONGUE/EMU/REE on row 13. Sigh...
>Joshua_Sokol: BCGOPUY J10 BU.GY +25 265
#note Ooh, COYPU 13C. Nice...
>Joe_Neff: EEILOTY 2E YO +16 267
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIOPTZ H11 ..CAP +27 292
#note CAP(O) is one more but I need to block too
>Joe_Neff: EEGILOT M7 LOGIE.T +22 289
>Joshua_Sokol: DHIOTTZ 8K ZO.ID +48 340
#note DH(O)TI sims better here.
>Joe_Neff: EILNOTW 4J .OWT +14 303
#note from Joe: nothing scores great, should just dump the W for 9
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIISTT O8 .ITHIEST +89 429
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIISTT --  -89 340
#note Worst play of the game... I convinced myself that DITHIER was good. Too bad I was just confusing DITHIEST* with DITHEIST...
>Joe_Neff: BEFILNU 10L F.B +14 317
#note from Joe - block that lane
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIISTT 6F HI +26 366
#note also STITHIED is good, I had no idea
from Joe: neither did I
>Joe_Neff: AEILNQU 14F QU. +32 349
>Joshua_Sokol: EISSTTV N2 VEST +22 388
#note This is a winner, but I was low on time and hadn't tracked the X. T(A)V 3G for sure.
>Joe_Neff: AAEILNX I2 EX +36 385
#note from Joe - Yes, could have lost by 1 instead of 2 :)
>Joshua_Sokol: AILST K1 ALT.S +18 406
#note Endgame pressure causes me to doubt even DISTAL. I didn't know his end rack for sure but I knew there were only 1 point tiles on it, therefore I knew that even if he had a 5 under the Q to go out, I would still win. (I also hoped the recount was correct). Bleh, way too close for comfort.
