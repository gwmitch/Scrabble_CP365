#note OF 8H looks best.

#note Missed VOMIT in this spot.
>Lester: BIO 10M OBI +26 176
>Mike: ACIMSSV L3 VIM +24 227
#note Not liking Quackle's top choice of MAVIS L1; seems a bit too open. I could live with VIMS L2 if it didn't telegraph the S so strongly. UMIAC H11, which I wasn't 100% on, is an interesting alternative.
>Lester: IKP O7 PIK. +30 206
>Mike: ACDFGSS M9 F..DS +26 253
#note SCAG B10 sims best; I guess the CG combo really is that bad.
>Lester: AIQ 7I QA.I +24 230
>Mike: ACEGISV E11 AVE +27 280
#note UVEAS H11 is a hair better according to the sim; it does do a decent job of collapsing two bingo lanes into one. The S isn't great on this board.
>Lester: R 9K .R. +6 236
>Mike: ACGIOOS 13I AGIO. +7 287
#note Inferring ?EST on Lester's rack (seems reasonable), Quackle prefers taking out the other line with COO N6.
>Lester: GO 14I GO +13 249
>Mike: ACEOSSS 15G ACES +26 313
#note Forgot about COSES. (Play misscored as 25.)
>Lester: ?EGLNRT A8 uRGENTL. +86 335
>Mike: HMOSSTT 12G SH +35 348
#note MOS M5 sims a bit better, since I'm pretty much guaranteed to draw a vowel or two.
>Lester: EE 12M .EE +13 348
>Mike: IMNOSTT N6 MOT +17 365
#note Blocking ZOA and the like. Since I have one fewer point than I think I do, there is apparently a losing case for this (not sure which it is). MIS M5 wins 100%.
>Lester: AEEIOUW 3L .IEW +20 368
#note VIE is better, but nothing wins.
>Mike: INSTZ B6 ZIT +33 398
#note Once Lester saw I had points for the Z, he resigned (since spread doesn't matter in a matchplay series.)
