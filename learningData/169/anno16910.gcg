#note Four hooks for this vs six for ROWELING. But hook plays to this hurt a lot more. Shrug? Against anyone else I play ROWELING and hope they miss TROWELING. LOWERING is fine here, though.

#note Ooh, looks like he had DROUTHY.

#note An ongoing theme of the night was bingoes that give back more points than they score...
>Adam_Logan: EERSTTU 15D .UTST.ER +24 264
#note His actual rack. Champ doesn't find it, but it does quite well in the sim.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDEIMNP J6 IMPED +28 215
#note Burned time here as it seemed like there should be something better. There isn't really. The board is really close to being shut down entirely, but there's not a whole lot I can do to prevent that. IMPED at lease makes it easy to open the right side next turn.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABCLNNR F4 BANC. +24 239
#note Hmm... so yeah, I didn't like playing through LOUIE with BANNER or something because it weakens the right side of the board. BUT... it also protects it. Look at what's unseen... CGKVV... all sorts of defensive plays are going to come down at M9 to spell game over. If I play BANNER, sure, it's less open to bingos, but it's very hard for Adam to profitably kill the board. I don't know. It's still not a sure thing that I need a bingo to catch up, as big Q and X plays are possible.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EILNRRV 5J LIVER +27 266
#note This play felt like a white flag, since there's no way he doesn't hook this into the triple lane to end the game. But, I mean, what else is there? It's possible he doesn't score well off the hook and I hit the X bomb to make it tighter. Maybe that's my best shot.

#note  Let the record show I used my only power tile to score zero points. MATEr is better for giving me 1 extra point next turn. But the best endgame is EAsE.
