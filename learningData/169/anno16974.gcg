#note Q is telling me that BLOCKED is four points better, which would indicate that the scary C9 opening is only minus two. I'm not certain I grok this.

#note Hated every choice here. I wanted to score here to stay within a bingo. Q likes 7B WICH which I'm not sure is quite that good (columns N and O will never be available after your fish to AINRT). If I had a play that used IW and hit the triple and played down to the S leaving a reasonable leave without giving a possible big comeback in column N, I didn't see it.

#note Not seeing BOOMY looks like a pretty big mistake now, doesn't it?
>Spherulitic: ACDEFOU J6 FOU +28 270
#note Probably too obsessed with dumping the U with two unseen. Not worth passing up OAF, perhaps.
