>Chuck_Armstrong: GINRW 8D WRING +26 26
>Jason: ACDHIIM E5 CHI.M +24 24
#note Missing the 60-point DHA(R)MIC.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AAIIMTT 6E .IMATIA +16 42
#note With an opening rack of AEEERUW against Jeff Fiszbein, Chuck played EAU. He asked what I thought (I said EWE). Quackle (and Grob) went with AWEE, leading to comments from Chuck about how off Quackle was. He sarcastically asked what it thought about this. (For the record, it approves.) :)
>Jason: ADFFINZ 5K ZIN +46 70
#note Ducky's preferring ZA by a point or two.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEGNORT M2 ROE.TGEN +74 116
>Jason: ACDEFFT 8J AFF.CT +54 124
#note Jeff's gf called at one point and asked how he was doing. At the time, he was 1-3. "Not well," he said. "But I beat 'number one'!" I responded: "Don't act like that's something; everybody's doing that today!"
>Chuck_Armstrong: ELX N1 LEX +33 149
>Jason: DDDEJYY O2 DYED +27 151
#note I'm not even calculating the odds of a DDJYY draw. But, I'm getting better at not letting my emotions show and playing through it. This is the only play.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?AELNRW O8 .ReELAWN +83 232
#note Knappster loves to look at my completed boards and guess which bingos are mine and which are my opponents. Rule of thumb: If it's a high-prob "baby bingo" then it's mine. The two bingos on this board, in a game against Chuck, might've fooled Knappster. :)
>Jason: AADJNVY 13L JAV. +28 179
>Chuck_Armstrong: BEER D8 .EBER +24 256
>Jason: AADGNPY C9 GAY +26 205
#note Note that all four S's are still out. I had a feeling one would be one of the last one or two in the bag. Lost no equity since ZIN, but DHARMIC hurt and my game-blowing play's still to come.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EII G5 I.I.E +9 265
>Jason: ABDENPQ E11 PED +30 235
#note No need to go "Ack! Q! Must get rid!" All four U's still out. Ducky really likes PEND (by four points), which is too risky for my tastes.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEUV K8 .AUVE +22 287
>Jason: ABNPQSU 10J Q.A +32 267
#note Not sure why I didn't play SQUAB/(PED)S. Kills the board for bingos, but I pull within nine; maybe I can run. Big mistake no. 2.
>Chuck_Armstrong: IKOS 14B KOIS +23 310
>Jason: BLNNPSU I2 BLUN. +8 275
#note This was a really vexing rack, and I took a lot of time on it. In the "What would Chuck do?" vein, I asked "What would Grob do?" "What would Winter do?" Chuck asked, laughing. "Challenge CENTIMO," I said. I considered the cute UN(C)L(I)P, but it barely opened. I needed a new bingo line and a good leave now. Q puts this second behind UNCLIP, but only a little bit.
>Chuck_Armstrong: OR N8 .OR +13 323
#note A couple turns later, Jeff asks aloud "What should I do with this?" Steve chimed in. "No, no," he said. "It's not what should *I* do with this. It's 'What would No. 1 do?' or 'What would Chuck do?' or 'What would the Champ (Grob) do?'" Very cold, but very funny.
>Jason: ?NOPSTU 2G PU. +7 282
#note Missing sUNSPOT and UNSPOi(L)T. And frustrated that my (C)OP was blocked, I missed PO(I) at L3. Big winning percentage hit (53.62% after sUNSPOT to 27.50% after this).
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADLR 15A LARD +34 357
#note I track the last A, last D, last L, last R, and go "Those were your bad tiles?!"
>Jason: ?INOSTU 13B ON +17 299
#note Chuck saw the playable bingo ... in part because it makes the blank a C. Again, took a lot of time, just didn't see it. Not on CP's radar, though, because the pool is so ugly. However, the last four in the bag were EHST (I pulled HT), so I would've won (albeit by only six under an optimally played endgame even with a dream draw). Q gives the 1G placement of ON almost a 75% chance to win. (Ironically, however, Chuck's rack of EOOOOST gives him guaranteed wins after ON at 1G.) Chuck did say this was a good non-bingo play, though.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOOOOST A11 OOT +7 364
#note Best, says CP. This or OE here gives him a 5/9 chance, nothing else comes close.
>Jason: ?HISTTU 1E SHUn +25 324
#note Chuck turned the bag upside down to empty it, knowing I'd be curious in the last two tiles. "ES?!" I exclaimed. "Are you kidding me?" But, I screwed the pooch on my own. And for whatever reason, I had Chuck with OSEOSE? and played a Division 9 endgame. (I blame the tracking sheets I was using ... different than what I've become so accustomed to. Blanks are in a different spot. Blah blah blah.) For the record, this is a 25-point error.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEOOSS N13 .OE +24 388
>Jason: ITT M13 .T +8 332
#note Adding the other T is six better. I also went over on time, something I've only done three times in my tournament career.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOSS 3D OSES +11 399
#note Well played by Chuck, who went 6-0 on the day (7-0 counting the consultation game) with only two close scrapes.
>Chuck_Armstrong:  (IT) +4 403
