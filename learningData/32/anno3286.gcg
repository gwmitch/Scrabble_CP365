#note WEENIE is the nonfish option, but I prefer this.
>Aldo_Cardia: EGS 10D SEG +15 41
>JD: ABEINRT 9C B. +7 13
#note quackle points out BETAINE at C7, which is gorgeous and yet clearly worse than fishing.

>Aldo_Cardia: IQ G5 QI +24 78
>JD: CDDOOTU 2F DU.OC +18 111
#note with the previous fishing, I like DUROC way better than OUTDO, the only reasonable alternative. DUROC does still allow -ING bingos though.

#note YO is asking for trouble
>Aldo_Cardia: FIRT D1 FRIT +28 196
>JD: CEEORST 1A COR. +27 187
#note thought about cashing the last S, but this looks best. frustratingly close to a bingo
>Aldo_Cardia: AEU J4 EAU +13 209
>JD: EEIRSTY B1 .Y +10 197
#note it would be nice to have a better fish, but nothing else is really all that good.
>Aldo_Cardia: AFO B4 OAF +32 241
>JD: AEEIRST L7 SERIATE +68 265
#note I thought about GRATINEES, but I wasn't sure and it gives him much more comeback anyway.
>Aldo_Cardia: AHI K10 AHI +26 267
>JD: ?ADGOUZ J12 ZAG +29 294
#note I don't think I made a mistake until now, but quackle finds this play detestable, and rightly so, because it creates a huge hotspot on column M that I didn't think about. I played ZAG to set myself up for a scoring play that he couldn't use. Quackle says ZA at E5 for just as many points or OUZO or ADZ.
>Aldo_Cardia: EINT M11 TINE +31 298
#note why ZAG was such a bad play. In retrospect, this is a very interesting move on his part, and I'm not sure that I realized it at the time. That's the last E, which means that he shouldn't be playing this without a really good reason. He explained after the game that he had the last two As and had forgotten about the D hook.
>JD: ?DDHOOU 15M DUH +27 321
>Aldo_Cardia: ILV 8L .VIL +21 319
>JD: ?DKLOOW 15G WOKs +43 364
#note the pool didn't look good enough to make bingoing a possibility. It might be a little bit short-sighted, but I didn't see what else I could do that would give me a chance. Quackle suggests either GOWK at F10 or COWL at A1, both of which are probably a little better than my play.
>Aldo_Cardia: BIMPRVX 14M .X +36 355
#note WOKS has tempo problems as well, unfortunately.
>JD: DIJLNOT N6 JO.NT +30 394
#note just dropping the D on SERIATE apparently does a little better on spread, but my play wins all endgames.
>Aldo_Cardia: AABPPRV 14C BRAVA +23 378
#note only leaves him one out
>JD: DILM D12 DI.L +12 406
#note this is the best sequence.
>Aldo_Cardia: PP G13 P.. +11 389
>JD: M 4J ..M +10 416
#note oops, there's a better spot...
