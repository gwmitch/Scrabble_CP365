>Lydia_Keras: ABDU 8H BAUD +14 14
>Matthew: ?EMNUVY K8 .EMY +20 20
#note 17 VAU is best. I get hung up on three things here: Not opening the triple lane on row 8, not keeping the Y on my rack, and not scoring less than 15 points. (-13.0)
>Lydia_Keras: AAGIT 7D TAIGA +12 26
>Matthew: ??EMNUV H2 UNMoV..lE +67 87
#note MANEUVER. I know there's a bunch of ways to spell it, but I couldn't be sure of the O-less versions. Plus with two blanks I'm just not going to see that. Style points are in EVONYMUS. (-9.5)
>Lydia_Keras: DEEINPR 3C REPIN.ED +76 102
>Matthew: EIJSWWZ 2B JEW +33 120
#note I can't remember my reason for not doing JEEZ, but it was obviously stupid. (-9.0)
>Lydia_Keras: Q F6 Q. +31 133
>Matthew: FFIISWZ F2 W.Z +23 143
#note The sim likes to set up the S with MIFF. With 3 esses and a Y unseen, that's a bit risky. (-11.0)
>Lydia_Keras: HNO J10 HON +34 167
>Matthew: AFFGILS 10D GAFF. +20 163
#note Ugh. I miss the HONG hook for all the best plays. GLIFF. (-11.0)
>Lydia_Keras: COT 11C COT +17 184
>Matthew: EILLLPS D2 ..LL +14 177
#note Yay I made the right move...
>Lydia_Keras: OX 6H .OX +29 213
>Matthew: EILOPRS 13E SPOILER +68 245
>Lydia_Keras: BEN H12 B.NE +27 240
>Matthew: ADEEOOT 5J ODEA +19 264
#note 14H NODE. (-5.4)
>Lydia_Keras: IIII -IIII +0 240
>Matthew: EORTTUV 8A VETO +27 291
#note TUTOR in the same spot wins the sim. (-2.4)
>Lydia_Keras: S F6 ..S +12 252
>Matthew: IOORRTU 15D OURI. +6 297
#note Other plays sim higher. But given Lydia's fish, I like my play best.
>Lydia_Keras: IS L12 IS +14 266
>Matthew: AEGHORT 4K OH +23 320
#note 14B TOGAE is a nice fit. But again, I like my play for shutting down bingo lanes.
>Lydia_Keras: ACIIL 2J ILIAC +23 289
>Matthew: AEGNRTY 14H .AY +35 355
>Lydia_Keras: AEIKNRS O2 SNAKIER +94 383
>Lydia_Keras: AEIKNRS --  -94 289
#note Scary phony. I spent a lot of time figuring out if I had to challenge to win. I really didn't like ILIACS*, but I couldn't be sure. (BAUD)EKIN is best.
>Matthew: DEGNRRT M8 TREND +10 365
#note No plays score points here. I wanted to close lanes before Lydia could fish off her K or open up a new spot. B6 GREED is the highest scoring play that also closes a lane. (-5.5)
>Lydia_Keras: AEIKNRS 15J SINKER +45 334
>Matthew: EGIRTTU 5A GUI.T +12 377
#note 14A TRUG (-5.0)
