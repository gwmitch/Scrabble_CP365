#note The options that I wrote down on my scoresheet were GOTH 36, WHIZ 38, WHITING 30 (wrote 32 though). Wasn't 100% on WITHING and completely missed WIGHT A11, which is probably best. 
>John_Luebkemann: ?AAIILL A8 LI +17 97
#note Can you see the tough bingo that John missed here? Quackle even likes one play a little better than the bingo: ILIA D1, which looks pretty solid. 
>Sam_Rosin: GHNOPTW D4 TH.NG +32 146
#note This wasn't a great play. TWIG in the same spot seems obviously better. Answer to previous turn quiz: QuILLAIA.
>John_Luebkemann: ?AABEIL E3 BAI.E +50 147
#note This was a nice play, foregoing the dinky LABIAtE 9H. However, I'd have kept EL? rather than AL? with BAIZA.
>Sam_Rosin: EMOPRUW A11 POWER +37 183
>John_Luebkemann: ?AELORV 14A .LEVAtOR +70 217
#note There are two tougher yet better bingos that I would have certainly missed here, one from the W and one from the R. 
>Sam_Rosin: ADEGMTU 15G DEGUM +36 219
#note I took a minute to decide between this and GAMED for 5 more. Answer to previous turn quiz: REpROVAL and WALkOVER.
>John_Luebkemann: AEJRUYY 13G YAY +31 248

#note Type a note here! 
>John_Luebkemann: EEIJORU 3E .IJOU +23 271
>Sam_Rosin: CILNNOT 12H CONIN +34 279
#note Wasn't sure of COLIN.
>John_Luebkemann: BEEERTX M9 BERET +28 299
#note Cool play! Just as good as EXERT 11J I think, the choice between those two is interesting.
>Sam_Rosin: DDLORST 10H TODDL.RS +66 345
>John_Luebkemann: ?EEFORX O10 .EXiER +60 359
#note John laid down dESEX first. FOXES looks much better to me.
>Sam_Rosin: AIIOSTT 4G OI +15 360
#note A two-play sim likes this play, and so does Championship player.
>John_Luebkemann: ACFIORS N14 FA +22 381
>Sam_Rosin: AIKSTTW J3 STAW +30 390
#note Champ. Player and a many-ply sim both like this
>John_Luebkemann: CINNORS K8 IN.R. +12 393
#note During our post-mortem, I felt like there might be a win here for John, but there isn't. ANCON or NARCOS 5J would be best.
