#note missed EATERY in the same spot.  5D (TRIVIAL)LY 30 is cool too, although if I had done that, Joel would have bingoed with IODIDES.

#note didn't know ECOTYPES.  I wasn't thrilled with my play, but I did have the S hook so hoped to use the triple next turn.

#note I spent a LONG time on this play.  I debated between this and 10J QATS 45 for several minutes.  There was a time when I thought passing up a bingo was bad karma, but I've overcome that.  However, Terry had been talking all weekend about various bingos she had passed up, and rarely did anything good come from it.  I was envisioning all kinds of horrible scenarios.  I play QATS, and he hooks an I under it and junk tiles for 40 points, I draw shit to Z?? and I lose.  I play QATS, he bingoes, I draw shit to Z??  I figured the bingo put me up 60, and even if he bingoes back, it's an even game.  Turns out 10J QATS 45 is a superior play, and Joel said he would have done it, but I was suffering from paranoia and decided to take the bingo and hope for the best.

#note this may have blocked a bingo.  I know he was very close to a bingo (as evidenced by his next play).

>Brad_W.: HMNNOTU 2E MHO +35 323
#note I didn't see any good blocking plays so I decided to try and outrun his bingo.

#note here comes another bout of paranoia.  There are 3 tiles in the bag.  The unseen pool is AEEFIINRUW.  If by some cosmic alignment the three tiles in the bag are EFW, he has URE(D)INIA to bingo out and win the tournament.  Any blocking play I came up with doesn't score enough to win if he draws the F and/or W.  So I had to make a scoring play and hope for the best.  I figured the chances were extremely small that those would be the exact 3 tiles in the bag.  The first tile I drew out of the bag was an I, and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.

#note I didn't play the endgame optimally... I was just trying to avoid an Andy Saunders moment.  As long as I make valid plays, I should be fine.
