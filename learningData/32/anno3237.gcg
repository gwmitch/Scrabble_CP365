#note saw F4 UN(C)IA 22 but decided I couldn't do it because of the EEE leave.  He was playing really slowly and had just fished off BC so I thought he might be close to a bingo so my play gums things up.  Turns out I did block a bingo (can't remember what he said it was).

>Brad_W.: ?CEJOOO H11 .OO +4 49
#note this was a weird play but I wanted to make it harder for him to bingo, and there weren't many N's left, and I figured if he did bingo there, at least I would get the triple.
