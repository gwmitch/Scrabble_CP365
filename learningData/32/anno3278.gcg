#note I liked this play at the time, but JAVA in the same spot looks easily better.
>John_Luebkemann: AEILMOV 4A VIME. +28 130
#note A two-ply sim favors playing shorter with OM G12.

#note I guess FUJI was good timing...

#note I'm quitting Scrabble.

#note A bunch of other good options here: trading HQ, LENGTH for 20, HENGE for 23, CHANG for 22, EH for 27

#note HALOGEN is probably worth it for 10 more. But why is UREDINIA Boy talking?
>Sam_Rosin: BDEEINP G4 BEEP.D +30 239
#note BINGED N10 is doing about 3 points better in a long two-ply sim. That's weird--it does offer parallel openings, but could that be right with him having just played 6 with ??SSSS out? I like BEEPED right now, but I'd be happy to hear arguments for BINGED.

#note I frustratingly cannot do anything to block the hotspot. However, there are two standout plays: MUSTY and MISTY 14B! The STARKERS definition is awesome; I didn't know it.

#note No wins here, but PISTE 15K would be five points better. Neither of us saw it.
