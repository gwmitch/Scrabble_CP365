#note This sims something silly like fifth-best. I missed the really pretty PAYEE 11I, as well as a few other plays in that spot forming YA -- YAUP, YEA, AYE, etc. -9

#note Five plays are all within a point of each other in the sim -- BOING, BINGO, BIOGEN, and the row 14 plays of INGOING and GIEING. I guess I like BIOGEN best because of the balanced IN leave, but it's not a big deal.

#note Sims best. It takes out the TWS, keeps a nice balanced AC, and even opens a bingo lane. Maybe I could even come back? He blew up his rack a little bit too -- maybe I'll get lucky and he'll draw crap while I draw a bingo?

#note UNARY L11 is a sweet play -- it sets up LYCEE to go out next turn. Best by a mile.
