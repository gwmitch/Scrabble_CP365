>Matthew: ADEIKPT 8D PIKED +30 30
#note PAIK is a verb. I wasn't sure. (-1.8)
>Chris_Lipe: ACINRSX 9E NIX +43 43
>Matthew: ABFIIOT 7C FOB +21 51
#note F(IN)ITO is best. (-2.2)
>Chris_Lipe: ACEELRS H8 .ECLARES +97 140
>Matthew: AEEIITU 13F AU.EI +7 58
#note Quackle prefers (L)IEU for some reason. I don't mind opening up the hot spots because Chris likely doesn't take both of them. (-3.9)
>Chris_Lipe: ACELLOU 14B LOCAL +22 162
#note LOCULE is a possibility at 14A. And COAL(BIN) is a good extension.
>Matthew: DEIOSTT 14J DITTO +27 85
#note Best.
>Chris_Lipe: AAELMSU L10 MULE.A +18 180
#note AMUSE  sims best. But Chris must have read my mind and knew I had a 106 point 2x2 that he needed to block.
>Matthew: AEIRSVY 11D VIRE.AY +26 111
#note I don't like the highest simming play 13B AY. Yes it sets up my S down column A, but it also sets up many other letters and it makes a play at 15A stronger. VIRELAY isn't great because it breaks up a good rack. But I really wanted to unload VY. (-6.6)
>Chris_Lipe: ADGGINS 13A GAG +18 198
>Matthew: ?DEGOST O9 GOoDEST +87 198
>Matthew: ?DEGOST --  -87 111
#note Terrible. (-40.8)
>Chris_Lipe: DEINOSW O12 WISE +40 238
#note NOWISE is nifty.
>Matthew: ?DEGOST J8 DOG. +13 124
#note DOTAGES just wasn't coming to me. That's definitely a retarded miss. (-19.0)
>Chris_Lipe: DMNNOOZ B10 ZON.. +34 272
#note Blocks my 15A QAT.
>Matthew: ?AEQSTT 9A QAT +28 152
#note M9 QAT sims better despite gumming up a bingo lane. (-5.4)
>Chris_Lipe: DMNORRS 12G M.R +13 285
#note N10 DROMON is best for Chris.
>Matthew: ?EIIRST K3 bITSIER +67 219
#note Even I can bingo with these fucking letters. Quackle says SILTIER. I guess I want to keep that S wide open since I need another bingo. (-1.3)
>Chris_Lipe: DHNORRS 4G DRON.SH +24 309
#note (DE)HORN is best.
>Matthew: ?BFHNNP I3 F.HN +14 233
>Chris_Lipe: EEORUVY 8J ..VOUR +42 351
#note OVERWISE is another option.
>Matthew: ?BENOPT 6B BOP +25 258
>Chris_Lipe: AEENUWY O4 UNWA.Y +13 364
#note Can unload another tile with UNWEARY.
