#note this is a phony.  I guess I knew it didn't look familiar from studying and it would be fairly high prob but it sounded so good and I didn't think it would get challenged.  I just played it.

#note I saw the 7 in my rack but didn't see the place to play it (6A CHOAnAE 80).  I should have found this.

>Brad_W.: ?AEIOQR N10 QI +33 243
#note I spent a lot of time on this play.  I didn't want to give her a big comeback on the triple, but I couldn't figure out where else to play.  I could have dumped the Q for 11 but I wanted to get more points for it.  In the end I decided to take a chance.  Even if she hit the triple, she would likely give me a bingo lane in return.

#note not sure what I was thinking here.  There are a number of better scoring plays in the upper-left part of the board.  14A JET 26 is also better than what I did, especially since there are no O's left.
