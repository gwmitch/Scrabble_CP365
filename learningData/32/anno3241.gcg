#note I wasn't thrilled with the leave but I guess that's a balanced rack.  May have played TEIID if I had seen it.

#note L8 (D)EITY 18 seems like a no-brainer but I didn't see it.

#note I was a little nervous about opening up the board after she had just fished off 2 tiles but I didn't see anything I liked.  12A MAXI 36 or L1 MAXI 36 seem like good plays but I didn't see them (I'm sure I saw the spots, I just didn't see the word).

>Brad_W.: AAHLNQX G13 HA +24 160
#note I should have traded but I was down and didn't want to trade for the 3rd time in my first 6 moves.  I couldn't play QAT or QANAT because it set up a huge comeback play.  Keeping leaves like ALNQX is usually not a recipe for success.

#note missed 12A WYLE 34.  6J (JO)WLY 26 is also nice.

>Brad_W.: BDELNTT 2J BL..D +28 292
#note I liked this play because it opened up part of the board to the left, scored decent, and left a decent leave
>Judy_H.: AERY O1 AERY +55 418
#note ouch
>Brad_W.: ACENOTT L8 .EACON +24 316
#note I threw in the towel again.  I couldn't find a good play on either triple.  10B (ZEAL)OT 23 is a cool play that remained open for a few turns.  Didn't know O10 OCTANT 29.
>Judy_H.: EEEGINS O7 GIE +23 441
