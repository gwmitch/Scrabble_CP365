#note Didn't know DOGLEG, which sims far better than any other play, and for good reason. I wasn't crazy for any O column plays or TOGGLE, but Quackle likes LODGE, GODET and TOGGLE all better than this. 
>Carl_Johnson: HOY O1 YO.H +45 201
#note I wish I played LODGE!
>Noah: ?EELLOT N2 T.EL +15 181
#note Missed ThEELOL, and might have chickened out on it if I found it. Quackle likes a series of non-bingo plays better than this. I missed KARATE, which is its favorite. It also prefers LeE, DOLE, LO, OLe, TOLE, and TOE to this. My leave-weighing here wasn't very good.
>Carl_Johnson: EU K3 ..EU +8 209
>Noah: ?ELORTY 11I ELYTROn +74 255
#note I didn't see TROLlEY or know pROTYLE. This is Quackle's favorite, but I actually like the other two for a bit more defense.

>Noah: DINPSSU M9 P..DU +22 321
#note Quackle likes the more volatile HOUND by a margin more than this. Possibly because of PERDUE-which I didn't know.

#note I held this.
>Noah: AANNOSS 15L OSSA +38 386
#note I many-plied it-Quackle says I should take ANOAS for a better leave. I hate emptying the bag though. Considering the aftermath of this play though, maybe ANOAS wouldn't have been so bad.
>Carl_Johnson: BEZ D12 B.Z +28 360
#note A great setup.
>Noah: AIINNNU E13 .AN +17 403
#note WOW. After the game, I was like "oh wow, VAU would have won!". I didn't even see RAMEN!. This is terrible.
>Carl_Johnson: AEIMRT 15A RAME. +40 400
#note There is a cool out sequence that is two points better. Don't waste your time though.
>Noah: IINNU 14J UN.... +10 413
>Noah: IINNU --  -10 403
#note Felt like I should try this. The out sequence is ME(N)TA setting up the nice I(ZA)R.
