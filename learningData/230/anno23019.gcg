>Josh_Greenway: ADENRVY 8D YARNED +28 28
#note So it's the last game. There's a lot of talk about Tim O'Hara Jr being Gibsonized. He's at 15-4 +1275 and Lindsey is at 14-5 +718 - a difference of 557. My knowledge says you can't gibsonize based on spread unless it's designated in the flyer before hand (which it wasn't). TSH is calling for a gibsonazation. I've been pushing for TSH to be updated to match the current rule. I talk to the director about it, but he seems like he's going to gibsonize. If Tim is not gibsonized, Lindsey and Tim will play, giving me a chance to get to 2nd place if Tim wins and I win vs Bill Snoddy. Instead, Lindsey holds 2nd unless I beat her by 156. So this situation is good for Lindsey. For me, I have lots of downside either way, so I don't press it. But looking back, this gibsonization which I believe is not NASPA-kosher, basically guarantees 1st and 2nd to Tim and Lindsey (unless I blow out Lindsey). The good news for me is Bill Snoddy is way behind me on spread so that shouldn't be a concern. So likely I'm going to finish 3rd. 
Here, in my first play I like YARNED (although holding V isn't great). Quackle wants nothing to do with me holding the V. One reason I like it is I'm going into this game determined to open the board.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?BBEEHL -  +0 0
#note exchange 7
>Josh_Greenway: AEFIOVV F4 FAVO. +19 47
#note quackle prefers FOVE(A) or FOVEA, which I don't know ('a shallow anatomical depression'). I play FAVO(R) which quackle says is the number 3 play.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: DGI E3 GID +21 21
>Josh_Greenway: EEEINOV I3 VEINE. +15 62
#note quackle isn't thrilled, but it's in the top 10. I think this follows the turning over more tiles strategy vs keeping the board open. The most important strategy for me at this point is get rid of the V.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EOR D4 ROE +22 43
>Josh_Greenway: CEGNOST 9C COG +17 79
#note I always think COGENTS* should be good, but it's not (it's CONGEST: to fill with excess) - but neither play anyway. I play COG here - but I could have played it to make C(ODA) and O(E) up above at C5, but this play I think opens things up more.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: NRU D8 ..URN +16 59
#note This is the second time I believe this was played against me this tournament. I still don't know what this word means ('pronoun: yours') and whether it take an S (it doesn't). 
>Josh_Greenway: AENSSTZ 4H Z.TAS +48 127
#note slam dunk here to take a 68 point lead!
>Lindsey_Dimmick: IPT 3K TIP +14 73
>Josh_Greenway: ADELNOS H4 .OA +16 143
#note This is my first missed bingo of the morning ('a theif'). I grab 16 points but don't do much to open the board (especially with an S in my leave).
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ERTU 11C T.UER +10 83
>Josh_Greenway: DEEKLNS F10 K.N +17 160
#note Move the K, keep a 77 point lead. I need to win by 156, right? Maybe I'll get really lucky!
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EF 6B FE. +14 97
>Josh_Greenway: DEEEILS 10F .EEL +10 170
#note I so want there to be a bingo in this rack (there isn't) so after spending a bunch of time looking, I come up with a play outside the top 20
>Lindsey_Dimmick: IM 7E M.I +15 112
>Josh_Greenway: DDEIIST N2 TIDIED +26 196
#note I may go a little too far here dumping lots of good tiles, but it certainly fits within the idea of opening things up. quackle doesn't hate it either.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: CER O6 REC +20 132
>Josh_Greenway: EINOOSS O1 NOSE +28 224
#note quackle really must like EINOSS as a leave because it wants me to play (KEN)O. I play the second best play, NOSE.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ILL 11I ILL +8 140
>Josh_Greenway: EIOOOSX 12K OXO +22 246
#note Up 84, I want to make a big X play here. This seems like the safest one, as quackle would rather me hook it to make (KEN)O again.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: BLW M10 BL.W +18 158
>Josh_Greenway: EIMOSST 14J MOIST +36 282
#note I miss two bingos here, all hooking to the bottom of BLOW. I put a ? next to this rack which means I thought there might be something and to check it later - but obviously I don't find either. It's MITOSES (MITOSES/MITOSIS 'a type of cell division') and SOMITES (a longitudinal segment of the body of some animals). I go for MOIST for 36 (bet after the bingos) and stretch my lead to 117.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AAGNP 15G PAGAN +30 188
>Josh_Greenway: AEJRSWY N9 RYA +31 313
#note Should have played JEW from J2, but I don't think I saw it. This gives me a 118 point lead
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?ABHITU 14B HAlIBUT +90 278
#note Lindsey makes a hell of a play here to lock up 2nd place. Nice find Lindsey!
>Josh_Greenway: ?EJQSUW 15A JEW +49 362
#note I had to think this through for a bit. I know Lindsey has HA remaining, which will let her score and go out. I can't play both J and Q this turn, which means she gets a bunch off my rack. I settle on this play, knowing Lindsey will get 24 points, but it looks good for the win. Seems like I'll get 3rd place after all...
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AH 7B AH +23 301
#note So I win by 30. I figure I've won 3rd. But then I find out that Bill Snoddy won his last game by 260 points!!! (note: just shy of what Lindsey would have needed to beat Tim by!). He grabs third place by 28 spread points. God, spread always comes back to bite me. No big deal though, as the difference between 3rd and 4th is $35. So I finish 14-6, in 4th place, and win $165. A good time was had by all.
