>Josh_Greenway: BCDEFJV 8G DEV +14 14
#note This is game #2 against Jennifer at this tournament. In game #1, Jennifer successfully challenged off 3 of my bingo attempts in a row! That game went to a recount - I went from losing by 2 to a tie to losing the game by 1. It was a tough one. Anyway in this game, I draw this mess of a rack. All of Quackle's top 20 plays are exchanges. I don't get the hint and play DEV. I'm hoping to use the rest of the big tiles to score some points in the next couple rounds.

#note Oh boy, here we go. 
>Josh_Greenway: BCFIJOO F4 JOB +33 47
#note This is the kind of play that brings me back into it after a bingo - down 19 is not that bad. quackle would have preferred COOF / O(W) / F(A) but I don't know that word (meaning = a dolt). 
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: AEQRU H1 QUARE +51 117
#note Now I'm really getting worried
>Josh_Greenway: ACFIOOS H10 FOO +17 64
#note Well now I'm down 70 and have some awesome tiles on my rack - double O? that's great. Oh, and an I and a C. terrific. I do have the S, so I have to score something here and try to clean up the rack. FOO is fine, it's quackle's #2 choice - it preferred FIASCO (which I missed) for 33. Not sure I would have taken it even if I saw it - I feel like I'm going to need that S. 
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: EHNOY E5 HONEY +47 164
#note Is HOWE good. I think it is but I probably held on this play. Damn, this puts me down 94 points. I don't challenge because I think it's probably good (it is - it means a valley)
>Josh_Greenway: ACIPSUY 1H .UAY +16 80
#note Another ugly rack. Quackle is all about playing YAUPS down from D8 but I don't know YAUPS. (YAUP means 'to YAWP' but I don't know what YAWP means (YAWP means to utter a harsh loud cry (which is what I want to do being down 96 points))). I do my best to clean up my rack by playing (Q)UAY. Quackle does not approve - though PICS is a decent leave, I guess.
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: EIRT 12G ..ITER +14 178
>Josh_Greenway: CIKLPSS K7 PICKL.SS +82 162
#note Quackle has all sorts of 40-48 point plays hre for me (playing SPIK(E) from A8, playing SPICK from L1) but I go big here since I'm down 98 points. I play PICKL(E)SS which, while I'm not sure is good, seems plausible (ie the New England Patriots will go PICKLESS in the first round this year after their bogus penalty for Deflategate). With Jennifer up 98, it creates a disincentive to challenge. So I play it, it's no good, and Jennifer doesn't challenge. Yay for me, I close the gap to 10 points.
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: EOW 2J WOE +32 210
>Josh_Greenway: ENOTUUX -  +0 162
#note Jennifer scores well with WOE for 32, putting me down by 42. I get the X, but a tough rack otherwise. Quackle wants me to take a quick 29 or 27 points playing XU, but for some reason, I believe this is the time to exchange. I hold ETX, and trade in NOUU.
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: AINV L4 VINA +18 228
>Josh_Greenway: EELRTTX M6 EX +39 201
#note Wow, I miss a 58 point play from I14: EX(S)ERT (which seems to be the opposite of INSERT as the definition is 'to thrust out') but grab 39 for just EX. Quackle would have preferred TEXT or TEXTER or EXERT in the same spot - all of which score a few more and open up the triple word square. Not sure why I keep it to just EX - seems hard to believe I was worried about defense as I'm still down 27 points (I'm realizing there were a number of under and over counts through the game so the commentary score may not match the quackle score exactly)
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: LM 5K M.L +20 248
>Josh_Greenway: EELORTT D9 OTTER +15 216
#note Not sure where this play comes from. I like Quackle's idea much better - extending FOO to (FOO)TER or (FOO)TLE ('to waste time'). The upside here os ot opens a line to C9, and I suppose it opens something at D14, but it makes the hook to K14 worse. Plus, it only scores 14. Not good.
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: DFHIOPT -  +0 248
#note exchange 4
>Josh_Greenway: AEEHLSU C9 HUE +27 243
#note The rack is getting worse, but I do pick up an S and take the lead by 2 with this quackle-approved play!
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: Z 3G Z. +21 269
>Josh_Greenway: AEILMRS 14F REALI.MS +64 307
#note So I know MAILERS and REMAILS - but they won't play. I keep looking. I fine REALISM but it doesn't play either. Or does it? Through the S at K14, I can make REALI(S)MS! Is it good? I don't know. I certainly take a few minutes with this play. If realism is a thing, can there be more than one of them? I think of painters and how one painter's form of realism might be different from another painter's... does it make sense? I hold my breathe and make the play... Jennifer challenges it... we go to the computer... and it comes back good! Thank god!
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: ABEFIPU -  +0 269
#note bad challenge
>Josh_Greenway: ACEGORT 15H GAT +25 332
#note quackle has some crazy ideas for what to do here. seems to me not taking that triple word at H15 is madness. QUackle would have preferred GOT to GAT, but for some reason I prefer to keep the O
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: ABEFIPU 7D I. +2 271
#note Jennifer opens up a lane. There's a blank and S left, and she may have them...
>Josh_Greenway: ACDEOPR C3 CAPED +30 362
#note Quackle doesn't like this play, but I think it's perfect. It scores 30 to give me a 98 point lead, and it shuts down the lane
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: ABEFNSU 10G ..F +9 280
#note Jennifer goes fishing
>Josh_Greenway: BINOORT 15M ORB +17 379
#note I grab a few points - less than quackle would like
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: D 4B D. +3 283
#note Jennifer opens a line...
>Josh_Greenway: AEGINOT A1 INTO +20 399
#note And I grab it (AGIO was the correct play here but INTO is all I can come up with)
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: ?AINRST K1 ..N +6 289
>Josh_Greenway: AEGINTU 15A AUNTIE +23 422
#note I lay down AUNTIE for 23... quackle would have preferred INGATE (a channel by which molten metal enters a mold), GUNITE  (a mixture of cement, sand and water), AUGITE (a mineral), or TAGINE ('tajine': an earthen Morrocon cooking pot). But I don't know any of those. 
>Jennifer_DeWaelsche: ?AEINRS B9 ARSoN +24 313
>Josh_Greenway: G 3G ..G +15 437
#note This win puts me at 13-5. I'm feeling like as long as I don't lose my last 2, I can cash. It's around this time I start peeking at the prize list - never a good idea.
