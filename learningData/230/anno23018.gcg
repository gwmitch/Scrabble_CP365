#note Time for game #3 against Linsey! Current standings are Tim 14-4, Lindsey 13-5, me 13-5. I really need this game, or risk falling out of the money...
>Josh_Greenway: EEOTTVW I6 VOTE +21 21
#note well my opening move is quackle's top choice - good start!
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EHMT J7 METH +32 46
>Josh_Greenway: CEILPTW K3 TWICE +27 48
#note Moving tiles, scoring points... game on!
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AEGN L2 GAEN +24 70
#note I'm seeing a pattern here (and from our two previous games). Linsey is keeping the board tight. I've got to try to keep things open - I feel like that will somehow favor me. I'm not sure why - other than it appears it's not what Lindsey wants to do.
>Josh_Greenway: JLOPRRR 3K ..J +20 68
#note Here's an example of how not to opn the board
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EO K10 OE +9 79
>Josh_Greenway: LOPRRRR L10 PRO +20 88
#note So many Rs! Quackle likes (HO)RROR and (E)RROR better, but both offer the triple line to Lindsey, so I grab 20 points to take a 9 point lead.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?CEMNST 13F CeMENTS +67 146
#note Oh boy, there go an S and a blank. Now I really need to keep the board open of else Lindsey is going to salt this lead away.
>Josh_Greenway: ILRRRUY -  +0 88
#note Exchange all 7 - let's try to find the other blank
>Lindsey_Dimmick: OW J4 OW +17 163
>Josh_Greenway: EIILOSY H11 LI.EY +33 121
#note Found an S, and found quackle's most recommended play
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EKN M9 KEN +24 187
>Josh_Greenway: DIILOSZ 11E ZIL. +26 147
#note Damn - missed ZOI(C) which is clearly the best play
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AFNRRUX 12D FA +21 208
>Josh_Greenway: DEEIOSS 13C OE +9 156
#note Tricky rack - need to open something up, because Lindsey is unlikely to give me a hook.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: Q F10 Q. +31 239
>Josh_Greenway: ADEIOSS -  +0 156
#note There are lots of 30 point plays here, but I'm going bingo hunting (feels like I'm going to need it). So I exchange 2: AO, keeping DEISS. 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: G 5J ...G +8 247
>Josh_Greenway: BDEINSS N8 BIDE +36 192
#note Lots of high scoring plays available here. QUackle likes breaking up the S's here by playing BIDS in the same place. What's good about either play is it opens a second line, it gets rid of a B and leaves me with ENS or NSS. For some reason in this situation I'll typically choose NSS - but ENS is superior.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: DGI O7 GID +35 282
>Josh_Greenway: ANOSSUX J13 .UN +5 197
#note could have gotten a bunch more points... I guess I'm trying to improve my rack, but AOSSX is not the leave bingos are made of
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AANOSTV 15H .O. +6 288
>Josh_Greenway: AAAOSSX 6M OX +28 225
#note Another best play here - but still down 63 points
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?AILRST B8 TAILoRS +69 357
#note yikes. this doesn't look good for me.
>Josh_Greenway: AAAADSS A8 AA +14 239
#note So many A's! quackle prefers AAS in the same spot but I'm still holding the 2 S's
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ABILRRU 14B .IR +11 368
>Josh_Greenway: AADIPSS C10 DA +8 247
#note Down 130 and I'm feeling awful. The rack is terrible, and there are very few lines. So I try to create a better one.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: IT C7 IT +6 374
>Josh_Greenway: AAIPRSS O11 SPAIR +35 282
#note Try to grab some points to get me to within 92 points. I pretty much know it's no good, but I doubt Lindsey will challenge - it burns the S, and it doesn't really threaten the lead. Lindsey holds, but doesn't challenge
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AORVY 6A OVARY +22 396
#note Lindsey continues shutting down lines and scores 22 to boot
>Josh_Greenway: ABNNRSU 5E BURN +26 308
#note I have Linsey tracked (and she is not going out) so I'm just trying to get out in 2 moves while maximizing points. quackle agrees with BURNS (exact same valuation as 10 other 4 letter B words)
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EEFLU 7E EF +13 409
>Josh_Greenway: ANS 4D SAN +17 325
#note one last play that quackle agrees with. this game leaves me at 13-6 and I know that Tim is at 15-4, and Lindsey 14-5. We'll see what game 20 has in store!
>Josh_Greenway:  (ELU) +6 331
