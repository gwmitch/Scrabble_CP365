#note This game acts as a simplified example of winnability. Its metric is unfortunately flawed: it uses Quackle's equity measurement.

#note However, Quackle's equity calculator is probably the only reliable metric for most Scrabble players today. The only metric that can compare to this metric is a top expert's analysis. I used a player who is very difficult to assess; who makes many decisions that do not align with any global strategical heuristic. This player is therefore quite difficult to exploit, which makes an equity-based strategy (points+leave+random opponent racks) the optimal strategy to undertake.

#note Blocking only possible bingo: SAHUARO? Check. 

Allowing me to win if I have AADHORS (if I see the winning play in F2 AS(U)RA) or at a minimum allowing me to tie with OH(E)D N1? 
Well, for that, there's Mastercard.

Can you find a play that wins with every single draw?

#note This game is a demonstration of how 2 seemingly small mistakes can cascade into a loss, whereas 10 errors, some quite significant, can translate into a win. 

You can come to two logical conclusions from this. Either:

a) You can blame this loss on bad luck, timing, drawing, or on your opponents fortune.
b) You can blame this loss on something you can control, in this case the moves you make.
