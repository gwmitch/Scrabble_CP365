#note This took me a nonzero amount of time to find. I was several seconds into considering how often I bingo with ex. U before I saw this. This was my first indication that it was going to be a long night. I missed out on several hours of sleep last night, and had a long day today. Not making escuses, but I've noticed that lack of sleep nearly always results in slow, clumsy Scrabble. Here we go!

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEFTWXY --  -32 68
#note No, I wasn't sure of it. But I thought it was likely good. And it looked better enough than my other plays to be worth it. But apparently even if I get away with it, WETLY is better.
>Adam_Logan: CEJNO F6 JO.NCE +37 120
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEFTWXY E11 FEW +28 96
#note Didn't like WEFT because of the overlaps. And WYTE felt too dangerous. But the sim favours WYTE over this.

#note So many 50+ point plays to choose from. Looks like taking the bingo is best.
>Adam_Logan: AEGIM 1K IMAGE +60 233
#note Ugggghhhh... this one stings. Because this being phony makes no sense at all.  And yet I knew it. It was just buried too deep in my brain and I didn't recall the curious M/ETHOXYL/S case until after the game. Big error.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DDGLPVW 11I V.LD +16 276
#note Missed the 2F plays. Though they aren't too much better than this.

#note Yet another missL 14I UPWARD. Was not on my game at all.

#note Adam's rack. Looks pretty dire for him, but he makes the right play and it pays off. Nice win for him. Tough one for me to swallow to several big mistakes.
