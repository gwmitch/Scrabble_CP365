>Noah: AAEGORS H2 AGAROSE +68 68
#note Cesar: First of all, Noah opened vertically, and with a bingo. Strike 1.
>Cesar: DEOQRRU 2F QU.RE +36 36
#note Cesar: keep order actually bingoes a lot more! they sim really close tho.
>Noah: ?AGNSTW 5F ST.AWiNG +72 140
#note Noah: I still like my play but I wonder if anyone prefers another bingo.
Cesar: then he wrote down the blank before laying down the bingo! wtf noah!
>Cesar: DEOORSV 8B OVERDO.S +63 99
#note Cesar: this could perhaps be the worst thing i've ever done in a scrabble game. don't even ask... (-26)
>Noah: AACIKLT L1 KACI.A +34 174
#note Noah: Uh, oops. I should've just played ANTICK or KA or something.
Cesar: i said out loud "that's not how you spell it" but in the end it's challenging that shows your word knowledge. i like when people say "i held it for X minutes" as if a bigger value of X was more indicative of how much you don't suck. well, I held it for X minutes.
>Cesar: EGILOOR 1L .OLO +24 123
#note Cesar: maybe 3B LOGOI for the leave. it does uglify some lanes though. (-3.5)
>Noah: ALNOOPT 7D POOL. +20 194
>Cesar: EGHINRU 3L .HUG +20 143
#note Cesar: quackle really likes F4 US; cool move, but I don't know how often it will work. I missed URGING. (-3)
>Noah: ACNPSTY 9E CAPS +37 231
#note Noah: A few good options here. GYP M5, AP I4, and COPY B7 might be worth thinking about. I think I should probably just take the raw points here though.
Cesar: blocking me all up
>Cesar: AEIMNRX 3C MAXIN. +48 191
>Noah: DEINRTY 4B TYRI +34 265
>Noah: DEINRTY --  -34 231
#note Noah: I was astounded by his insta-challenge, being sure this was good. I must have confused this with GYRI. Whoops yet again I guess.
Cesar: :P
>Cesar: ELRRTUW D2 W.UR +14 205
>Noah: DEINRTY O3 .ENTRY +33 264
>Cesar: ?AELRTT N8 mARTLET +70 275
#note Cesar: brattle might make it a bit more volatile if i get lucky with a D draw, but i don't like that. maybe battler/blatter for the R. (-1.5)
>Noah: ABDDILT O13 DIB +23 287
>Cesar: EH 10F HE +35 310
>Noah: ADEFLNT K5 .NFLATED +74 361
>Cesar: EFIIINV 12D VINIFIE. +88 398

Noah: Whoa!
>Noah: DEEEEMZ M9 ZEE +47 408
#note Noah: Overscored by four.
Cesar: :/
>Cesar: BIIJOTY D10 TI.Y +10 408
#note Cesar: unwinnable; i don't know what the bets way to make him mess up is
Noah: Cesar doesn't have a win here. If you can find his best play, you are awesome.
>Noah: DEEIMNU H12 .UME +27 435
#note Noah: Can you find my best play here?
>Cesar: BIJO 11C J.B +32 440
