#note 4A HERNIAS is worth the same. Do I open the 3x3 lane or open the big 2F spot?
>Ed_De_Guzman: AEIINRT 2B INERTIA +76 102
>Kolton_K: EFLMNOW 1A FLOW +55 162
#note I actually considered trying WOLFMEN* 
>Ed_De_Guzman: AHPR 4C HARP +23 125

>Kolton_K: ?EKMNOU --  -95 191
#note Took a lot of guts to challenge off this plausible phony.

#note I played this, he challenged, and as I stood up I realized I could've played MU(S)KOxEN in the same spot!

>Kolton_K: AELNOOV 1K OV.LE +36 371
#note I was all set to play (RE)NOVA(T)E just because it seemed cool. OV(U)LE is definitely best.

#note All of Q's plays involve dumping the O and keeping RETINA. I'll take the points thank you.
>Ed_De_Guzman: AD N6 AD. +29 334
>Kolton_K: AEEJTTW O4 JET +25 458
#note J12 JEW or JAW seem too dangerous with the case S most likely on his rack. J12 TAJ, however, seems like a great idea.
>Ed_De_Guzman: AEEOPRS 9N ER +18 352
#note He was really low on time. This sets up (D)OSE pretty nicely
>Kolton_K: AETUW 12B WA. +20 478
#note Given his low amount of time, I figured he was going to play (D)OSE regardless of what I did, so this is seemingly safe.
