>the_other_guy: AAFV 8G FAVA +20 20
#note No, not *that* other guy.  The *other* one.  Yup, this one.
>me: DHIINXZ J8 .DZ +33 33
#note After debating lower-scoring moves for a few minutes, I decided to take the points in this situation.  The Duck quacks its unwavering approval.
>the_other_guy: EGGY 11J EGGY +32 52
>me: HIILNRX M10 L.NX +28 61
#note Jeez, more thinking, but still grabbing the points.  7D NIHIL (17) looks interesting but I never even considered it.
>the_other_guy: ABILOST H2 SAILBO.T +61 113
#note He decided to forego the six points for OBLASTI in two spots (7A, N4).  SAILBOAT sims equally well.  But no one really believes in simulation, right?
>me: EEHIIRU L11 .IE +21 82
#note 3rd straight move where maximizing score appears to be the optimal selection.  The leaves suck in each case, but at least they're getting better...
>the_other_guy: ?ANORTT 5F TO.eRANT +64 177
#note He was apparently so focused on finding a double-double (doesn't exist) that he missed options that scored as much as 14 more (ATTORNs/RATTONs at 12D).
>me: EHIMRUU M1 HUMI.URE +78 160
#note Yes, Virginia, you can bingo with two Us and a seemingly ugly looking rack.  The more you know.
>the_other_guy: ACO 1L C.AO +36 213
#note This wasn't an immediate move on his part.  Really hoped he left that DLS-TWS for me.  Or maybe I shouldn't really be worrying about that...
>me: ?AEIPWW 8L W.EP +39 199
#note WArPWI(S)E! Yeah, I meant not to play that.  Would've looked so gauche to lay down back-to-back low-prob 8s.
>the_other_guy: DEEIQRU 12D QUERIED +102 315
#note Ouch.  Also took his time with this.  Maybe didn't see it immediately or not being sure of ADZED, but it almost felt like a slowroll.
>me: ?AEEIIW 13C AI +15 214
#note At first glance, this may look idiotic.  But it's just about the highest possible score, opens another couple lines, and the leave ain't terrible.  After 1 billion iterations, Q concurs.
>the_other_guy: LNOO 2D LOON. +7 322
#note Alrighty then.  I'd love to find out what the other three tiles were.
>me: ?EEEITW 14D sWEETIE +74 288
#note Take that, honey!
>the_other_guy: DILNY 15G LINDY +40 362
#note Yeah, go ahead and spoil my FROTH for 53.  Pfft.
>me: ABFHORT 4K FA.TH +39 327
#note Can't complain about this score and/or leave.
>the_other_guy: EKPRS B11 PERKS +25 387
#note With two other Ss unseen (and I guess he had one), this takes out the obvious hook and makes it much more difficult to bingo in that area...
>me: BIJOORS A10 JOB +26 353
#note Unless I do this, which slightly increases the bingo opportunities.  (And yes, I thought about BIJO(U) E8 for the same score but didn't want to shut down anything.)
>the_other_guy: GMU D1 G.UM +18 405
#note If only this provided another possible bingo.  Probably shouldn't be greedy...
>me: DINOORS C5 INDOORS +66 419
#note R(H)ODO(P)SIN.  Yeah, sure.  But it scores one less so, c'mon, don't even bother considering it.   Looks like I'm in good shape if I can draw four tiles that will allow an outplay...
>the_other_guy: CENRSTV 8A TR.VE +36 441
#note He almost ran down his clock trying to look for something to give him an out next move.  Just score, baby.
>me: AAEI B6 AI. +12 431
#note Ugh, vowels.  My nemesis 42.8% of the time.  He had 10 seconds, so I quickly spotted MAE 3M (12) and slapped this down.
>the_other_guy: CNS E7 S.C +5 446
#note And...SC(E)N(E).  He didn't really like SEC in post-mortem but the key is to play the C and another tile and not worry about how much you could've scored.
>me: AE 3M .AE +12 443
#note Damn, why couldn't this have been CSW?! OMGWTFBBQ, TWL?
>me:  (N) +2 445
#note Still, don't think either of us could complain about how exciting this one turned out to be.
