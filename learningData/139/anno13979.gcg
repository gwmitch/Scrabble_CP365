#note Best play here is pretty cool.
>Noah: AEIMNTW L12 WAME +32 126
#note I didn't actually consider AW L11 and WO 12L, which both seem like good options here. I'm not sure what he kept with ANON, though I doubt it was anything worth more than two points. WO is actually quite strong here, as the AEIMNT draws bingo a lot on this board, which isn't friendly to a lot of bingos otherwise. Giving Carl little to work with is also a boon, especially since he seems to have more trouble on board like those after AW and WO than after WAME.

#note I didn't really like the entropy of row 15, but it didn't seem like the worst thing, since Carl just played off six tiles. One thing that surprised me a bit is that, at least in terms of average score next turn, AINT is a fair bit better than ENT as a leave. If that's true, I think I'm okay with giving away the easier scoring opportunities for Carl with FEW, because lane 15 still isn't by favorite thing.

#note I played this far too quickly! I tend to play words I'm not sure of far too quickly, and that's a big deficiency in my play. I'd say I pretty much had no idea whether this was good, but I liked it because I thought it somewhat likely that he kept an X last turn. Unfortunately, my unsureness of the word probably means I should just play QI, especially since he has some non-X racks in his range as well. Something to work on: taking more time on words you aren't sure of.

#note Collins.
>Noah: DEELNTX J8 .EX +57 238
#note Carl suggested blocking as an option here, but it doesn't look like I have any really good blocks, while he can just fish with his excellent rack and hope to bingo soon. A four-ply sim bears this out, strongly preferring KEX to GLED. If you see any good blocks let me know.
>Carl: ?AGIINS 4E AGIStIN. +60 184
>Noah: DEILNST G12 NE.T +10 248
#note I liked blocking the remaining lanes and setting myself up for a decent scoring play next turn. Row 15 seemed difficult enough to hit, but Carl can open the board easily enough next turn. Fishing doesn't really do much for me, so LID should be the play here, just because row 15 isn't that powerful -- sim shows that Carl doesn't even bingo 8% of the time after LID. DILS also isn't a great leave to deal with a likely opening Carl would make here. NEWT seems altogether outclassed, and it's a good example of me needingto improve my risk evaluation skills. 
>Carl: DELNORU 15A RUNDLE. +30 214
#note Though this is one of the worse responses to my last play, he could still make difficult to block openings in any number of spots without this play.

>Noah: ?BHISTV F2 BI.HT +19 291
#note Really wanted to play VIBS# here. Bingoing will probably win it for me. What I need to do here is keep a couple spots open and also keep the best leave I can.  BIT(S) and HIT(S) didn't do the latter very well, and while row 2 isn't the best, it's good enough for me. I like this play. Do you see a better opening?

>Noah: ?EERSVY 2F .Y +7 298
#note This play is pretty awful. I missed SuRVEYED! I looked for sevens for awhile, but only looked for plays to the D briefly, as it didn't seem like a "likely" bingo lane for this rack. 
>Carl: AEIMOTU C7 MEOU +23 360
#note Unforunately, Carl couldn't take advantage of my huge mistake.
