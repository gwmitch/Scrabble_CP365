#note I'm trying to be cute here again. I think that I've got a really good chance at bombing with the X if she underlaps the L with an A or O, which seems somewhat likely. Q hates me for this, -7. 
>Fran_Silver: CDENORU K4 CRUNODE +82 82
#note Of course.

>Fran_Silver: AAEEIII -AEII +0 82
#note Fran said she had all vowels here and then exchanged 4. Maybe she had a blank? Maybe she held AEI? I dunno. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ILQTWW J10 WILT +28 102
#note Fran laughs and says "got the same letters back"

#note I just couldn't see anything except this. I suck at scrabble. 
>Fran_Silver: AEEIMRT A5 .EME +27 219
#note Fran complains to me after the game that she couldn't play EMIRATE anywhere on this rack. But she could play EMERITAE or DIAMETER. 
>Matt_Canik: EGGIPRU D4 P.UGGER +26 265
#note I can't decide if PUGGIER is valid. I saw PILEA/PRIG and then I guess Matt decided EGU was a really, really bad leave. I don't know what I was thinking here, honestly. This is awful scrabble.

>Matt_Canik: DEIIOSY 13M YO +22 287
#note Fishing- pulling an N or T right now makes this leave very friendly...
>Fran_Silver: ABEIORT 2B ABORTI.E +72 333
#note Fran doesn't need to fish, though. She plays off 5 tiles and draws bingos. 
>Matt_Canik: DEIIIST 12B TIDIES +28 315
#note And instead of keeping a level head and fishing AXIL, I rage and play this.
