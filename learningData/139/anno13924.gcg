#note Heh, heh. Okay, I missed ENFOLDS, but still, I had to play this for appropriateness.

#note Damn, I keep missing shit!!! I playing horribly!!!
>Matthew_Hodge: DGIU 13C GUID +20 172
>Winter: ?EILORU N1 sOILURE +69 237
#note I deserve the weak bingo--if I had played G(E)AR, I might have hit an 80-pointer.

>Winter: HIIOOOY 4H HOY +20 302
#note This is where I started to worry. I knew Quackle would want me to exchange, but I wanted to stay a bingo ahead. If I exchange and draw another bad rack, that might allow him to catch up. And with the JXZ in the bag, score is a possibility even on this board.
>Matthew_Hodge: IKT H1 KIT. +33 249
>Winter: EEIIMOO 5H EM +20 322
#note Again, the 20 points was just tempting enough to keep me from exchaning. I figured the vowels would have to run out sooner or later.

#note Fuck--BIOG was the play.
>Matthew_Hodge: EP B10 PE. +11 285
>Winter: DGILMOO A7 LIMO +22 368
#note Agonized a while here, over what to leave on my rack, but I DIDN'T consider the possibility of drawing what I drew next.
>Matthew_Hodge: AEEILPR 1B PEARLI.E +65 350
>Matthew_Hodge: AEEILPR --  -65 285
#note Oh boy. I wasn't at all sure if this was good, but what I drew forced the challenge.
>Winter: DGJOUXZ G2 XU +22 390
#note Holy shit. Fortunately I had the time to determine that I did not have a win if I let the bingo go, and I was able to challenge and guarantee I'd win by the 56 I need to ensure I passed Jim Burlant for 3rd.
