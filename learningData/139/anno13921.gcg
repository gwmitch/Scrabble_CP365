>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADERTT H4 DRATTEd +68 68
#note DETRACT is best here. Good start anyway! Gotta stop Dean and help Montreal win!
>Dean_Porporo: OZ 6F ZO. +32 32
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IOOOPR F6 .OO +12 80
#note IODOPHOR. Did not know that one. 
>Dean_Porporo: AX I8 AX +36 68
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DIOPRS J2 SPIROiD +67 147
#note DISPORT and DROPSIED top this one. Also PERIODS and SPIROID/SPOROID, as well as TORPIDS are more points E8, but I wasn't sure which took an S and didn't know TORPIDS. I got challenged for this play though, so I was happy.
>Dean_Porporo: ACDEFIP -  +0 68
>Joshua_Sokol: EGGIMPR 9C GRIM +24 171
#note This is also not the best. It's number 10 :/ 
>Dean_Porporo: DILY D8 D.ILY +22 90
#note Held him here. It just looks so bad.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGIOP 8A GOA. +21 192
#note APOGEE here. GOAD is up there though.
>Dean_Porporo: EFH K4 FEH +32 122
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIPUVV -VUVIE +0 192
#note Nothing is attractive here at all. I missed DEV though. Best exchange is all 7.
>Dean_Porporo: EOQTU 4C QUOTE. +32 154
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEGHPW 3E HEW +29 221
#note Really hoping he had no J...
>Dean_Porporo: DELSTTU L6 SLUTTED +74 228
#note I held him, to no avail. I couldn't afford a lost challenge, but I should've been 100% sure it was bogus... Nice job, Dean.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGIPR 2F PAGE. +31 252
#note GRIPE or RIPE here. I'm starting to get worried...
>Dean_Porporo: ABM K11 BAM +25 253
>Joshua_Sokol: EFIINRS L3 IF +28 280
#note Just keep scoring, just keep scoring, just keep scoring, scoring, scoring.
>Dean_Porporo: IKLN 2L KILN +26 279
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEINRS A8 .REENIES +80 360
#note RESEEING is best. I'm so paranoid though.
>Dean_Porporo: AV 11D .AV +12 291
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIIJVW 10L .AJ +26 386
#note Ugh, now I can't really block the 3x3 without putting myself in danger of losing. Championship player likes viva. TAJ is way down there.
>Dean_Porporo: NR M1 R.N +10 301
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIIUVW O1 U.AI +15 401
#note Now I have to assume he has the S. Blocking is a must. NUBIA works though. Sim oscillates between the 2, with an ES inference. Turns out he didn't even have it.
>Dean_Porporo: ELO J11 OLE +16 317
>Joshua_Sokol: BEISVWY C12 BEVY +31 432
#note BEVY leaves one in the bag and blocks the easyish s lane. Why is there any debate? Apparently it wins only 99,99% of the time, with 10 other choices (including (d)EV still!) that win for sure.
>Dean_Porporo: N E3 ..N +12 329
>Joshua_Sokol: CIINSUW 15C .WIS +14 446
>Dean_Porporo: ACENORT N10 .ETON +24 353
#note ARC blocks my out play and leaves JETON for next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: CINU 14F UNCI +12 458
