#note I was very unsure of this during the game, but in retrospect I stand by it.  The problem is that it's clear that they have an S from the last play, but on an otherwise tight board, they are sitting pretty with the possibility of scoring on row 11, hooking TEXTS, while I don't have much to do.  This opens up additional fronts, while giving me chances to draw an S of my own, or an L for the AECIAL hook, so that even though they are likely to score well on the next turn, I will also be able to keep scoring in reply.  It's also my highest scoring play.

#note I correctly determined that AHED and OHED at D12 were the two best plays here.  On the surface, AHED seems more natural because it sheds the duplicate A.  Unquestionably AEOS is more versatile and is going to draw into bingos more often than AAES.  However, it seemed to me that AAES wasn't that much worse, and that on a board with otherwise limited scoring possibilities, retaining the tiles for PAWAS H11 should favor OHED.  Simulation does not agree with me, favoring AHED by 3.4.  That's not a huge difference, but I'm still surprised the difference is as large as that.

#note I felt like the tile bag was taunting me for my choice on the last play, by dealing me the tiles that would have made AGAROSE N4 if I had played the more natural AHED.  Turns out that I had an even better play than PAWAS: SAAG E3 not only scores three more, it also takes out the dangerous F2-F8 lane.
>Mosaic: ?EIPTVY B12 TYP. +18 256
#note This was a natural play to try to create more open lines, but in the post-mortem I came up with an alternative that may give them even better comeback chances: just dropping the P to make PIT 7B.  After this, they are free-rolling with the blank as an S on column A.  Though they can't hit it right away, they do have chances to draw into several bingos, including VILAYET F2, INVERITY 3G, DEVILTRY 2H, and various -LY ending bingos.
