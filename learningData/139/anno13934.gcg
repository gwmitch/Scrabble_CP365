>Noah_W: IKOQSUY H7 YOK +20 20
>E_Tran: ?DEILMN 10B MILDENs +77 77
#note Eric: I liked how this prevented YOKE hooks, and closed the board.
>Noah_W: EEINQSU I2 EQUINES +85 105
>E_Tran: DGGOUUY B10 .UGGY +24 101
>Noah_W: AINOOSU 3I .UINOA +30 135
>E_Tran: BDEIOTU G2 OUTBID +21 122
#note Eric: Does he have an S here?  Or is he vowel heavy (hence not playing QUOIN)?  4K DUIT looks like a good option if I want to be defensive.  
>Noah_W: EFORSST O1 FOSTERS +99 234
>E_Tran: ACEGNOS D4 CONGEA.S +74 196
#note Noah: What about COINAGES to keep a more open board here? CONGEALS really constricts the left side.
>Noah_W: CEELRTX 2D CEL.T.X +59 293
#note Noah: I'm kind of surprised with the numbers here -- Quackle has me bingoing over half the time after (E)X. I thought of EX, but didn't think CEELRT would be that good. Even if I ended up deciding on CELOTEX, I should've taken a few minutes to see just what EX would draw, just as I would on an opening rack, as I still had tons of time left here.
>E_Tran: BDDHOOW 8A BOW.D +33 229
>Noah_W: ?EEIRTV L3 .ERVIEsT +72 365
>E_Tran: ADHOPRV 5A VAP.R +20 249
#note Eric: 5K PROVE keeps the H next turn, and is better for bingoing.  Missed it.  C8 WHIP is also a nice play.
>Noah_W: AEFHINR N2 H.AF +37 402
>E_Tran: ADHNORT M9 HOARD +36 285
#note Eric: HOARD has the best valuation, but HONDA/HADRON have 0.02 more win%.
