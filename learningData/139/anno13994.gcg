>Ted_Rosen: AKNOS 8D KAONS +28 28
>Sean_Wrona: EELNNTW D8 .NELT +18 18
#note I know how wretched the W is but I still think I like this more than ANEW because I don't like leaving three consonants, leaving the F10 hotspot, and making it very easy to block both remaining open vowels (the E and the O).
>Ted_Rosen: AAH 9G AHA +16 44
>Sean_Wrona: AEGHJNW 10H HAJ +40 58
#note Yeah, WHANG's clearly better and I didn't see it but I still think this is pretty close.  I probably shouldn't have done it not having an I however...
>Ted_Rosen: LOO 11I LOO +18 62
>Sean_Wrona: EGNNTVW L8 VENT +15 73
#note I just missed the JOW hook.  WENT is clearly the play.  I was probably just trying to be overly defensive because I thought Ted was setting up something, which he probably was, but obviously playing VENT isn't overly defensive because it still allows the obvious E hook.
>Ted_Rosen: AEMPR 8J RE.AMP +39 101
>Sean_Wrona: AEEGMNW M7 W.ME +25 98
#note I like this better than EWE both for defense and because with my level of word knowledge, keeping the M probably is not worth 2 points...
>Ted_Rosen: EGIIRST O5 GRI.IEST +62 163
>Sean_Wrona: ADEGINR F7 G. +3 101
#note I was mostly focused on trying to find something from the G and just flat out missed GARDENIA.  I've missed GARDENIA online too.  I don't know what it is about that word.  At this point, the game looks very much in doubt even if I do bingo (which I obviously have a strong chance of doing next play).
>Ted_Rosen: AEIOTTW -AEIO +0 163
#note I have no idea what his rack was, or what he exchanged.  I may have accidentally had him as "Human" instead of "Human with Unknown Racks", but this was not his rack.
>Sean_Wrona: ADEINRU 6D UNAIRED +70 171
#note Well, at least I lucked out.   I can't believe I missed the C9 play because I love those long crosswords, but UNAIRED here is much better for defense.  I misscored this as 68 instead of 70 (apparently I only counted the A on the TLS once), but still, that's inexcusable for an erstwhile math whiz.
>Ted_Rosen: AOR E11 OAR +12 175
>Sean_Wrona: DEEGLTU H1 LEDGE. +30 201
>Ted_Rosen: AUY J3 YAU. +8 183
>Sean_Wrona: ?BDNOTU 2B UNBOlT.D +70 271
#note BUTTONED at 2B is probably the best bingo for defense.
>Ted_Rosen: ?CEIIOO -?CE +0 183
#note Again, this isn't his rack.
>Sean_Wrona: EILOOSZ F10 ZOO +38 309
#note This essentially cinches it.
>Ted_Rosen: AQ B1 Q.A +12 195
>Sean_Wrona: EEILOSV 4A VILE +35 344
#note Missed a lot here.  The bingo LOVELIES, the opportunity for a number of slick crosswords at N10 (and I had just played NEVE in the last game!)  However this does sim better than everything except LOVELIES and VOILE.
>Ted_Rosen: EP 7K PE. +20 215
>Sean_Wrona: EFFIORS 12L SOF. +32 376
#note Okay, SIFT is better because of the number of Is left.  I'll add that since this is still only my third tournament, I was tracking terribly.
>Ted_Rosen: BCU 10A CUB. +10 225
>Sean_Wrona: EFIIRTX B6 FIXT.RE +25 401
#note I was preoccupied with blocking bingo lanes rather than looking for good X plays, but obviously XERIC is better.  Because I tracked so poorly, I did not realize I was taking the last tile here, which may not have been a good move given that the high-scoring W and Y were still left and CUBE indicates that he very likely had a bingo-prone rack.  The sim indicated that this play still had the potential of losing, but I can't figure out what scenario could give Ted the win after this play.
>Ted_Rosen: ?CEIINT 1H .ImNETIC +83 308
#note I've never seen this word before and I challenged it.  Ted himself thought it was good but wasn't completely sure.  That totally made this game look much closer than it really was.  If it had turned out to not be valid, then I would have obviously played YWIS A12 on the next turn and this would look like a colossal blowout...
