>Sean_Wrona: ABCEENR I6 CABER +20 20
#note Wow, I didn't realize how bad this was until I actually simmed it, but that's because I'm not good enough and I don't know enough bingos for the C to be that much of an asset...
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADFGHIN G8 FAD +24 32
>Sean_Wrona: AAENNPY 6G PA.Y +19 39
#note I chickened out on both DORP and DORY (both of which I KNOW are words), and J10 is clearly the only place worth playing.  This is made worse because I don't have an S.  This play makes me cringe more than the later play(s) when I choked this game.
>Matthew_O'Connor: GHINRRT -HRT +0 32
>Sean_Wrona: ?AAEENN 5J ANE +11 50
#note Other plays sim better, but I still prefer this because I didn't want any duplication.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EFGIINR 4H FIRING +40 72
>Sean_Wrona: ?ABCEIN 3B CArBINE +77 127
#note Stopped looking after I saw CARBINE, but I definitely like CABINET better because it effectively shuts down row 2 to bingos (oh, and scores 1 point more of course).
>Matthew_O'Connor: Q -Q +0 72
>Sean_Wrona: ADLOORZ 5E ZOO +28 155
#note I don't really have an excuse for missing ZOA.  And considering I lost by 6 points, any of these plays arguably could have cost me the game.

>Sean_Wrona: DIMT J10 MI.T +25 238
#note I did not record my entire rack.  All I know is that I had a D in addition to the letters I played.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EEKP 11B PEKE +30 218
>Sean_Wrona: DEELOTV B3 .LOVE +18 256
#note The row 13 plays look much better to me now...
>Matthew_O'Connor: INTUW 8A UNWIT +38 256
#note ...as a result of this, although this could be Jim Geary's Law of the Negative Instance or whatever he called it creeping up again.
>Sean_Wrona: DEJMOTT 13B JOT +27 283
>Matthew_O'Connor: AEELUUV B11 .U.A +26 282
>Sean_Wrona: DEEMRST A14 ME +16 299
#note With an S and a blank unseen, I definitely prefer this to TAME or DAME, even though it's not unlikely that I would be able to capitalize from either of those plays.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EELOUVX 13F OX +37 319
>Sean_Wrona: DEIRSST N4 STRIDES +73 372
#note CHOKE CHOKE CHOKE.  I know DISSERT is a word but I simply don't (or didn't then, certainly now I do) have the DISSERT/STRIDES anagram pair locked into my brain so I stopped looking after STRIDES and was instead focusing on whether FIRING took an S or not.  I wasn't sure and Matt wasn't either but after I played it he decided not to challenge.  Had I actually seen DISSERT, I probably would have played DISSERT/MISTS which might have been much more dangerous since he had the blank at the end.  This is indeed a major error as the three other bingos have a winning percentage of 73-77% while this has a winning percentage of only 64% below three fishing plays.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?EEHLUV M9 HELVE +41 360
#note Even though I've seen all the fives at least once I don't remember this one, but I wasn't going to dare challenge in that position.
>Sean_Wrona: EGIIORU 1J OURIE +11 383
#note I still had a chance to win even after HELVE.  I spent several minutes trying to fix my tracking which I screwed up (again).  Although I realized Matt had the blank, I somehow didn't realize that he had the H nor did I have any idea whether HELVE could take an S or not.  I think I thought his rack was HIL? when I had that I.  Despite several spending minutes on it, I screwed up on the tracking.  I still had a chance to win but it was very counterintuitive.  Usually you want to play more tiles and play your harder to play tiles so I put down OURIE with not much time left.  The real winning play, EGO 14D is harder to spot and not at all obvious.  Furthermore, even though I knew much of Matt's rack it just didn't occur to me he was going to go out, so I wanted to set up a chance to go out on the next play.  OURIE left me with GI where I could play VIG in either of two spots, but I made so many errors in this position and I deserved to lose.  EGO isn't THAT obvious though, and missing DISSERT was the worst play.  Oddly, I'm still upset about PACY more than either of the plays in which I choked.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?HLU 14K LUsH +23 383
#note Since I wasn't sure of HELVE in the first place, I had to challenge this but I knew it would be good.  Interestingly, Matt intimidated me before the tournament more than anyone else there, including Ben, whom I definitely play better against online even though he's even higher-rated.  I dreaded playing him more than anyone else because my online record against him is atrocious and I just play badly.  I definitely play better in 25 minute games than 3 minute speed games (which are more in his metier) but I'm still frustrated I can't beat him live either, but I had plenty of opportunities to win this and just didn't deserve to.
