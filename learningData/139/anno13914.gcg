#note WIDDER is simming a lot better, despite opening a decent scoring spot with the awkward CG. I guess most of my leaves here are pretty awkward, so it's worth taking the 4 extra points.
>Wayne: AHOY 7G AHOY +24 38
>Rafi: EGNRSSW J4 GRE.S +23 121
#note This play does a great job killing the bottom of the board. Plays like WOPS or SHOW look like good alternatives, giving me a good chance of bingoing if Wayne opens the board - however, I'm telegraphing the S so it's a bit less likely that I'll be gifted a spot.

>Rafi: INOSTWW C13 WOW +28 149
>Wayne: ANN B12 NAN +16 78
>Rafi: EIKNSTY A8 SKITE +33 182
#note I figured it was more likely that Wayne would find a 7 to the triple rather than an 8 starting with W. Otherwise, WITNEY/WESKIT are options. I also thought of playing K(E)Y to go for a bingo myself - which is probably best without inferring a bingo leave and might be best after NAN as well.

#note No quackle, I'm not playing TUI for 18 or FIL for 19. Ditching the I might be right though with 5 unseen.
>Wayne: CEET F2 CETE +15 162
>Rafi: ?EIINRU 2E s.IURINE +61 301
#note I thought INQUIRE was more risky, giving up a small chance at a 100+ comeback. SCIURINE opens nice spots, but I think we'll often just trade 40+ point plays.

>Rafi: ADELORU 14H ROULADE +72 373
#note Didn't even think of looking for POULARDE!
>Wayne: ABELZ 1A BLAZE +79 278
#note Underscored by 6.
>Rafi: AEIIIMU 12F .UI +18 391
#note I should have at least been aware enough to block FISH by playing EMU - AIII (with 6 consonants unseen) is worth blocking a 50 point spot. What happens next wasn't even on my radar...
