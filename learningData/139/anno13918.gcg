#note Rut-roh. I smell the bingo coming.

>Winter: HIMNRRU L8 M.RIN +27 77
#note Meanwhile, trying to make something of my racks.
>Wally_Schultz: AEEHIST 4E HEA.IEST +78 142
#note Surprise, surprise.

>Winter: HORRRUU K11 HOUR +26 103
#note Meanwhile, in the land of the sucky racks.

#note Blocky Blockerson.
>Winter: ?RRTUYY 3D YURT +18 121
#note 
These racks, jeez.
>Wally_Schultz: ?EEFLOV 14D LEFtOVE. +73 231
#note Okay, it's a nice find, but will he stop bingoing already???
>Winter: ?AINRTY 15G AY +31 152
#note 
Here's where things start to go really wrong for me. I spent A LOT of time trying to bingo to that L and E, and that creates problems for me later.
>Wally_Schultz: DEU 8D DUE +10 241
>Winter: ?INNRTT I3 N.T +6 158
#note It continues, turn after turn of being close to a bingo. Anyway, I've gotta keep creating openings, because Wally is in blocking mode.
>Wally_Schultz: DO 6E DO +12 253
>Winter: ?BINORT 15A ORBIT +29 187
#note Another no-go! Shoulda played ROBIN though. That became important, not having the R in the triple column.
>Wally_Schultz: AQ L2 QA. +12 265
#note FUCK!!! BLOCKED!!!t
>Winter: ?ENOSST 5K OS +21 208
#note I suspected there was a play to the R, and I probably find it if I write down all the racks, but I decided it wasn't worth it, given the time I would lose and the comeback that Wally would probably get.
>Wally_Schultz: AL 14A LA +10 275
#note BLOCKY BLOCKERTON!!!
>Winter: ?EINSTW M1 WIN +27 235
#note If he hadn't blocked, WINTE(R) would have gotten me really 
>Wally_Schultz: IP J11 PI +15 290
#note A block that would prove disastrous for Wally!
>Winter: ?AEEEST N1 ES +33 268
#note I know SEE or SAE would increase my bingo chances, but only IF Wally creates an openig, and by this poin I'm going to come within 22 points, and I'm hoping to win it without the bingo.
>Wally_Schultz: AMN 2B NAM +17 307
#note HOLY SHIT HE ACTUALLY CREATED AN OPENING!!!

>Winter: ?AEEFNT N5 EF +26 294
#note Choose the short play because I want to draw the game out as long as possible. The more turns, the more chances for him to make a mistake.
>Wally_Schultz: EX O4 EX +19 326
#note Not happy he got the X, but at least he didn't slam me with it.
>Winter: ?AAELNT 8L ..AN +21 315
#note I look at the N, but I don't have enough time to go through all possibilities. Once I see the 21 for (MO)AN, to bring me within 9 points, I jump at it.
>Wally_Schultz: IKT 1A KIT +25 351
#note I was hoping he wouldn't have something like this--I needed him to fizzle one more time. It looked bad after this.
>Winter: ?AADELT 12D DEALAT...s +72 387
#note And then magic happens, and I raise my game to the level of a real top expert. Given how fatigued I was, this was one of my best tourney moments in recent memory.
