#note took a long time on this rack.  I liked having the case A, and wanted to set up a Z-overlap spot.  taking the pts with M3 AGATIZE sims best.  I guess he might not have vowels to use that spot.  But that looked too easy.  My play sims second.

#note 15J AUNTIE is sick.  I wanted to fish for an F or S; and still keep some insurance in case I draw the Q.  Probably overthinking the situation.  This is also phoney.  Just 4B PIU is simming best.  Should just make the safe play, unless I have a good reason otherwise.
