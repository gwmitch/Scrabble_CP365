>Tim_O'Hara: AJT 8G TAJ +20 20
#note This game was close to perfect on my end.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BCFIIMT 7F MIB +15 15
#note 4th best play! 9F FIB are better by 4.8 apparently despite scoring only 1 more point. I think it's a tossup but I see Quackle's point. Minor mistake if that. -4.8
>Tim_O'Hara: EH 6F EH +19 39
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACFIRTT 5G CRAFT +29 44
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes 5D FARCI with TT leave. EEEEH? I like my play actually but Quackle says -2.9.
>Tim_O'Hara: DEIL 4I LIED +19 58
#note Scored as 18.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CINOPTY E1 POINTY +31 75
#note 3rd best play! Quackle likes E3 COPY keeping INT for 31. I agree. I didn't even see the 9H spot for POINTY. This was a bit too hasty but still good. -3
>Tim_O'Hara: ERZ 1E .REZ +45 103
#note That's why! Kind of unlucky though.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACEHTU D3 TAU +14 89
#note 10th best play! 2G HAUTE is best for 26 but my play bingos more I think. CHATEAU was unplayable sadly. I'd probably do this again but Quackle thinks otherwise. -4.9
>Tim_O'Hara: AABDERS 2H ABRADES +85 188
#note Best play for Tim! I thought it was spelled ABRAIDS*! The only thing in those letter is BAIDARS which is new.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEHIOX -???? +0 89
#note I challenged. EPIC. FAIL. BAD. My biggest mistake of the game.
>Tim_O'Hara: AAWY 1L AWAY +44 232
#note I lost a tempo here with the bad challenge.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDEHNR C5 RANCHED +71 160
#note Best play! And only bingo! Things would get better.
>Tim_O'Hara: GOOPS B10 POGOS +41 273
#note Tim scored this as 35 for some reason.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNORUV A13 GUV +26 186
#note Best play! Starting to get hot here!
>Tim_O'Hara: EEGINOR 11A N.. +4 277
#note I thought this was a strange play. A8 plays are still possible through the C.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFINORX 8A FO.I +30 216
#note 5th best play! I don't even see A7 XENON. -7.4. I think this is ok.
>Tim_O'Hara: QSU D11 SUQ +29 306
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DENRTX 12D .NDERTaX +66 282
#note Best play! And onky bingo! Tim held but wisely let go. I'm back in the game!
>Tim_O'Hara: EIMOV 11J MOVIE +41 347
>Jonathan_Lindh: EKNOOOW 13J WONK +39 321
#note 3rd best play! This works though. 13J WOKE is better I guess but this works out. -6.8. Judgement call given pool.
>Tim_O'Hara: EIL H12 .ILE +12 359
#note I thought this play was questionable by Tim given there was a blank out and he had the lead. Maybe he had an S. This was very risky and may have cost him the game. I'd like to think I bated another person into a costly endgame mistake but I'm not so sure.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGOORU 9H ROGUE +22 343
#note Best play! I didn't realize I was emptying the bag, but surprisingly emptying the bag is right is I want to maximize my chances at the blank.
>Tim_O'Hara: EEIILNS O7 LINES +26 385
#note Quackle is being stupid thinking there are mutiple blanks left. There is one and I have it. Maybe LENSE N9 and WONKS but I have kEITLOA. I don't know if see it. This was a hard breaking loss for Tim and another Miracle Jon (Registered Trademark) comeback for me!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEILOT 15H .TIOLAtE +74 417
#note Best play! I pull out another game I should have lost!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (??EI) +4 421
#note -29.8 total equity loss with at least 7.8 of it (CRAFT and TAU) being intentional. This was a very good game. 5 of 12 plays best plays. Three bingos RANCHED, UNDERTAX, and ETIOLATE. I was ON this game.
