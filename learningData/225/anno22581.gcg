#note I was due for a game where I just completely crapped the bed. Here we go.

>Chris_Williams: ACEEIRT 4B CREATI.E +76 76
>Matthew_Larocque: DILOTWY 3I DOILY +27 53
#note I didn't settle on this easily. I saw WO(R)DILY but wasn't sure enough to play it over other options. WI(T)TY and WO(R)DY get rid of the W+Y, but the 3I spot looked too ripe for him to score 30+ so I thought killing it would be worth it. I missed the 38 point DI(C)TY however, and 5D TWO sets up my Y for next turn.
>Chris_Williams: AAEPRST 8A SEPARAT. +83 159
#note Maybe it was too early to worry about "defense".
>Matthew_Larocque: FIIISTW I6 IF +21 74
#note Unfortunately this rack won't likely get fixed in one turn, but I can't fathom exchanging either. Playing one of the W(A)IFs must be better though because I already kept the W longer than I should have. WI(T)?
>Chris_Williams: EEGO 9C OGEE +18 177
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIRSTW F2 WI. +14 88
#note I can't bingo because I have the W, so I go for the WI(T) setup feeling good about bingoing soon.
>Chris_Williams: ADEHKNT 1F THANKED +108 285
#note Did that actually just happen?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRST A8 .TAINERS +77 165
#note I laughed out loud here just because I drew THE Scrabble rack, but it doesn't matter because this game is already an avalanche in favour of of Chris.

>Matthew_Larocque: EEMNRXY 5D MY +28 193
#note Missed M(I)X for some reason although this could still work out.
>Chris_Williams: GP 3E G.P +23 332
>Matthew_Larocque: EELNRVX E8 ..VEL +16 209
#note Or I could just play MAGLEV. (E)X(I)LE/R might be better because the X isn't going to help me bingo.
>Chris_Williams: CDEIQU 12D C.IQUED +40 372
#note Well that sucked.... MAGLEV turned to be a major miss.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFLNRX H11 L.REX +36 245
#note I really should see IFF here, although I thought I saw GIF, so that's weird. I can't remember if I saw the 62 point plays but I don't think so, I didn't take too long to play LUREX.
>Chris_Williams: OORRSTW 14E ROS.WORT +65 437
#note I don't know the -WORT words at all, and Chris didn't really have a good reason to play a phony when the game is completely his. Joke's on me.
>Matthew_Larocque: ??FINOU J5 OF +28 273
#note I didn't know UNFOILED/INFOUGHT, missed INFUSION. OF seemed reasonable enough aside from keeping the stupid U.
>Chris_Williams: AAB 2L ABA +21 458
>Matthew_Larocque: ??HINOU L12 HU. +12 285
#note WHODUNIT! 2x blank racks tend to overwhelm my ability to anagram. The H and the U really limit this rack despite having 2 blanks. INFOUGHT is the only other bingo.
>Chris_Williams: AEINNOT M7 ENATION +77 535
#note I was horrified.
>Matthew_Larocque: ??ADINU 15L sAND +18 303
#note Chris playing a bingo there was so unexpected, and my instant thought was that I had to try and anagram a double blank rack with a minimum of 4 overlaps. I think I had less than a minute here. There's only 3 bingos here, the non overlap being SUNDIAL which Chris was able to find fairly quickly. INDUNAS overlaps but for some reason I don't know that word at all. I checked if URANIDE fit, but I didn't even check if it made a 6x overlap! I'm so dissapointed I missed that.

>Matthew_Larocque:  (NZ) +22 337
#note -40 for overtime. I mean drawing two blanks and losing by this much.... hard to argue against this being my worst game of the tournament. Thankfully it didn't translate into a disastrous finish like last year.
