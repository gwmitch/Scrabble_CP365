#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 3: Press the Button!
Best play! Took a while on this play. Debated between this and 2nd choice CIG. This is better than 8G CIG by 2 equity points.
>Al_Helfgott: FHO 9G FOH +37 37
#note This was incorrectly scored as 29 by Al. WOW.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGNRTU 7A GAUNTER +67 89
#note 2nd best play! Why didn't I see the other placement at 10H? -5.
>Al_Helfgott: IMOTY L8 .OMITY +26 63
#note Would have blocked this too.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DELNOSX K8 .LEX +46 135
#note 3rd best play! But highest scoring. 8A OX is preferred for 45. I see why now. -7.5 to Quackle but I don't think it's that steep.
>Al_Helfgott: HT B6 H.T +14 77
>Jonathan_Lindh: DNOOPSV F3 POOV. +18 153
#note 2nd best play! C3 VODOU is best! -4.5. Small mistakes adding up but still playing fairly well.
>Al_Helfgott: ?AIORST M3 ORAlIST +79 156
#note Best play by Al! Along with 3 others in the same spot.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEJNSTZ 4B ZEND. +30 183
#note 7th best play! First sizeable mistake of the game. Yeah, 4K NERTZ. 10F ZEDS. BAD BAD BAD
>Al_Helfgott: AEG A5 GA.E +29 185
>Jonathan_Lindh: BIJRSTY B2 BI. +28 211
#note 5th best play! Everything isn't that great here. Quackle likes C1 JIBE for 26. My play is fine I think but Quackle says -6.4.
>Al_Helfgott: AENORSU 10A ARENOUS +68 253
>Jonathan_Lindh: EJORSTY C9 J.TES +40 251
#note 13th best play! Horrible. L3 JOY keeping ERST for 44. How am I not seeing these plays? -29.4.
>Al_Helfgott: GRW 12A GR.W +20 273
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIMORSY 7I YAS +37 288
#note 9th best play! 11C TOY for 28 is apparently best. Mine is -8.8. Small to medium mistakes adding up.
>Al_Helfgott: AKQU 4J QUA.K +36 309
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIMNRU 5I NIM +29 317
#note 12th best play! Why not AIM? I don't know why? -6.5
>Al_Helfgott: DEFR C1 DEF.R +32 341
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADELORU A10 .R.UED +24 341
#note 13L YOU is best with the fish but it seems WAY to fishy for me. My play is fine I think. -7 to Quackle but I like my play MUCH better.
>Al_Helfgott: CDEEO 1C .ECODE +33 374
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABILLO O1 BALs +33 374
#note If this correct, I missed vIOLABLY d13. I don't know if this was my rack though. WAY too many mistakes.
>Al_Helfgott: EEIIPVW 11C .EW +28 402
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIILO M13 OI +14 388
#note Is there a win here? DAMN IT! There is a win! N1 ALIKE. I blew this game. I could have gone 6-1 and instead go 3.5-3.5. Even with the bad score by Al, ALIKE gets the job done. SAD FACE!
>Al_Helfgott: INNPV N12 INN +16 418
#note 13I PINYON seems to best for Al? Ok.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIL 15K AIL +7 395
#note Oh good grief. ALIKE was available again? I'm not counting equity at this point. I just realized I gifted Al the WHOLE tournament.
>Al_Helfgott: PV K3 V.. +8 426
#note E9 VOW is one more. This is 2nd best.
>Jonathan_Lindh: E D7 .E +3 398
#note This is 3rd best but I was literally at 0:00. 3F PE is 2 more.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (P) +6 404
#note Game scored as 404-418 Al. I gifted Al this toournament because if I pull this game out I WIN the whole tournament. Doug and I would be 4.5 each and I win on better spread. I also gifted David Englehardt the win in the Thanksgiving Day tournament. I PLAY HORRIBLE ENDGAMES! I'm Mr. -999.9 ENDGAME MAN!
