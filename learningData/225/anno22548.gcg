#note the odds of saint triple-tripling are obviously very low, but given the shape of the board a comeback should be just about impossible if I block...so I sacrificed the points.

#note Should play FLOW which saves HOBS/HUBS at 15A to go out. actually Q's favorite is just fishing the F for FEM which gives me the flexibility of choosing big plays next turn. in any case there are no bingos in the pool that he can have.
