#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 2: Press the Button! Here comes Episode 2 from this tournament. Despite one big miscue, I liked this game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEGIIZ 8E BIZE +30 30
#note 6th best play! Quackle likes 8G BIZ best but I don't like the E hook. Judgement call. Q says -3.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EOW 9C WOE +14 14
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGIINU 9H DUI +8 38
#note 4th best play! Every option stunk here. Quackle likes blowing up the rack with 10A DIEING best and I didn't even see the 10E spot for DUI which is 2nd best. I like 10E DUI here. -4.5 or -4 to my preferred play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EIORU 8J OURIE +8 22
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGILNOS L8 .ESOLING +72 110
#note 3rd best play! I did not see 10B LONGIES for 79 or 10A ELOIGNS for 75. -7.
>Harriette_Lakernick: CEGNNUX -CEGNN +0 22
#note Harriette's letters were terrible throughout this tournament, and they were REALLY bad this game.

>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABFINT 11K F.B +16 257
#note 4th best play! M8 (I)F is best apparently but I like my play more. Quackle says -2.2 but I'd do mine again.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EIMOPS 11D IMPOSE +32 81
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AAINNT 15A ANTItAN. +86 343
#note Best play! Harriette complimented me after this play! This was one of my favorite plays of the tournament.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EMPTY 12A EMPTY +37 118
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DELLNR M7 L.D +12 355
#note 6th best play! This is actually the 2nd best of the non-bingo plays which makes me feel better, but how do I miss ENROLLED and RONDELLE, both for 74 on this line. This was a bad mistake. -26.9
>Harriette_Lakernick: CEHN A8 HENC. +30 148
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ELNRTT 14D LET +12 367
#note 11th best play! Nothing bingos here. Quackle likes A7 THENCE. I think my play is Ok but Quackle says -4.5. Lots of similar plays here.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EEJS 6J JEES +32 180
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ANRRTT J12 R.T +5 372
#note 7th best play! 7A TARN is Quackle's favorite but that doesn't seem right. -6.7 according to Quackle but I like my play better.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AIOQTWY 13B YA +25 205
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AINORT H1 NOTARIs.. +80 452
#note Best play! And a new common 9 to boot. My other 2 9's played in tournaments were OUTDATING for 68 in Danville Day 1 (my 4th tourney) and MUTINEERS for 63 at the 2015 Nationals (my 7th tourney). Also NOTARIZED in same spot here.
>Harriette_Lakernick: CU L4 CU. +10 215
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADQRSVX 2F QU.D +34 486
#note Didn'tn record rack but look at it! 99% this is best.
>Harriette_Lakernick: X F7 X. +9 224
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIRSTVW 3E VIS.A +28 514
#note Quackle says this is best but I need to block B column because of DARIOLE. I didn't track correctly. This endgame miscue led me to go with a new tracking system. Create my own tracking sheet with jumbo sized letters.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADEILOR B2 DARIOLE +75 299
#note :(
>Harriette_Lakernick:  (RTW) +12 311
#note Score recorded as 514-311. This was a good game, but it should have been even more lopsided. 6 of my 13 plays were top plays according to Quackle and there are a few more I prefer to Quackle's top choices. -54.8 total equity loss. -16.9 of it was intentional so -37.9 of it was unintentional. One missed bingo and a mad endgame, but 4 bingos and a 9. Still a good game!
