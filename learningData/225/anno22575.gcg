#note Best play!

#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: DEW 9G DEW +33 57
>Jonathan_Lindh: EKMQSTW 7E .EW +25 117
#note 8th best play! D11 SKEW is best apparently. Quackle says -4.4 but I disagree. I don't like creating a hook I don't have and I prefer keeping an S. MQT is just an awful leave.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ?DDGLNU 11E .UDDLiNG +76 133
#note Best play by Tim! And only bingo!
>Jonathan_Lindh: IKMQRST 10J QI +63 180
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AAB 6J BAA +26 159
>Jonathan_Lindh: EKMORST 8L TOKE +31 211
#note 4th best play! F6 KEN for 17 is Quackle's best. I prefer 12J SKORT for 42 which I most certainly did not see. My play is fine though. -7.8 is a bit harsh Quackle.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ?EEFGGL -GGF +0 159
#note Tim exchanged. Not actual rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAFLMRS 9M FAR +27 238
#note Best play! Maybe I played better today than I initially thought.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BE 10N BE +28 187
>Jonathan_Lindh: AILMSTV F11 .LVA +9 247
#note Bad mistake. H11 DAVIT for 30 definitely best. -15.8. Way off the map.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EIMORSU H11 .EMUR +27 214
#note 9th best play for Tim. Actual rack. Tim missed MOUSIER in 2 different locations. 15C for 88 and C7 for 85. Bad mistake.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IIMSTTT F3 TITM.. +14 261
#note Best play! I loved this play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: JU 5D JU. +20 234
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINOSTY 3C NIT.Y +24 285
#note Uggh! I didn't even look through the R. Up to 4 misses in 5 games with one game as a speed game. This was so bad. -40.2. SEROTINY was my bingo. 15F.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: INZ 10B ZIN. +35 269
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIOOSX B10 .AXES +42 327
#note 5th best play! C6 OXO is best for 27 but I didn't see ODONATES. -7 but my play is fine.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AEPS A12 APES +37 306
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIINOO L11 .ONIA +14 341
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ORSV 15K S.VOR +24 330
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINORT C9 N.TER +34 375
#note 13F VOMERINE? Lol. That's the best play. Quackle says -10.6 but I like it. Bingos are unlikely at this stage and I need to score.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: CEGHIOY 13J YO.IC +20 350
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEHIOO 5K AHI +25 400
#note 4th best play! B6 HAO is Quackle's best but this is fine. -3.7 but I'd do it again. My play sets up my blank for SHALT.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EEGGIIR D13 EGG +13 363
#note Best play for Tim! Along with EGG in the same spot.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EOOO 14N OE +16 416
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EIIR 2A REI +8 371
#note Best play according to Quackle but this can't be right because of what I have coming next!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?OO 1A OOt +16 432
#note Best play! Perfect endgame!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (I) +2 434
#note Score recorded as 432-370. 8 out of 15 plays were best plays. One missed bingo. DAVIT and SEROTINY were huge unacceptable misses. -82.5 total equity but only -56 of it unintentional. Two really bad plays.
