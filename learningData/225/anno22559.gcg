#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 6: Press the Button! My second missed bingo of the tournament after vIOLABLY and this one for sure I knew I missed. This should have been a win. It wasn't. It was my first tie. My exchange was bad. Kept IT?. -48 LOL. SO bad.

>Doug_Lundquist: CEOS N11 CO.ES +32 140
>Jonathan_Lindh: AHILOTY 15L HO.T +33 247
#note 4th best play! 15J TOYISH for 48 is best and probably ices the game on the spot. This is -15.8 and another terrible play. My equity is closing in on -100
>Doug_Lundquist: AFGLU 14F FUGAL +41 181
#note TOYISH TOYISH
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEILLY 15B AIYEE +17 264
#note 13th bets play! 6C ILEAL is Quackle's best but I wanted to mae it hard for Doug to go on row 15. Only -5.9 back. I'm tempted to this again.
>Doug_Lundquist: EEV E1 ..VEE +20 201
#note This is phony. Only PAVEED. Change #2 to clinch this game blown.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFLLPT 4C FL.D +16 280
#note 7th best play! Like the last play, this is blocking so Quackle doesn't evaluate this as well. Judging by Doug's body language, he has picked up the last blank so I'm not playing too open. -7.1 but I'd do it again.
>Doug_Lundquist: EGI 3A GIE +18 219
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEJLOPT A1 JO. +33 313
#note Best play! 6 of my plays have been best plays. In addition, 2 of them were blocking plays that I'd probably do again.
>Doug_Lundquist: ?AEIIRS D4 .AIRIESt +60 279
#note Only bingo for Doug! If I do 2nd best EELPOUTT E11, Doug hits GASIFIER A3 for a ton. I think he sees it too.

#note 2I HELPER. Mr -999.9 Point Endgame Man has returned from a relaxing vacation. -20.3
>Doug_Lundquist: EOS 15H OES +40 319
#note That sound you here is -999.9 Point Endgame Man laughing at his incompetence. No wait. It's his incontinence.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EELNNOR C8 TREEN +14 341
>Doug_Lundquist: LMMNTWY B10 MY +29 348
>Jonathan_Lindh: LLT F7 ..LL +8 349
#note Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Game Man is now on vacation again. I actually played the last two turns correctly. I think.
>Doug_Lundquist: MNNOW 14B NOM +23 371
#note Doug's endgame is correct. He's no -999.9 Point Endgame Man.
>Jonathan_Lindh: T 11B ...T +12 361
#note I get this down for a pathetic tie. 8 of my 16 plays were best plays. 2 were blocking plays I'd do again given the board dynamics. The other 6 were just...just...
