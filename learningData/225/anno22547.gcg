>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ?AEGNTU 8D GAUNTEr +68 68
#note 2nd best play for Tim! All of the 68 points plays sims really close to one another. 8B AUGMENT is apparently best for 68 and 71.8 equity. -2.4 according to Quackle but I think it's a wash.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADMORTV E5 MAT.DOR +40 40
#note Best play! By far! To ften people give up when their opponent pulls a blank bingo on the first turn but I calmly lay this down. Nothing even comes close to this play.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EEF F10 FEE +29 97
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFGIIV D2 FIVE +24 64
#note 3rd best play. I would have played d1 VEGIE for 30 if I saw it. -6.1
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: OW F5 OW +31 128
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGILRS 7H AXE +38 102
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGILRS --  -38 64
#note This is one of the worst Scrabble things I have ever done. I had a blond moment. I am blond after all.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AHO 7I HAO +20 148
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGIUXY C2 EX +41 105
#note 2nd best play! Why didn't I just AXE at 9H in the correct spot? I was very blond during this game. -5 says the Duck
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: J J6 J.. +25 173
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIOOUY 5I YAGI +26 131
#note 3rd best play! Quackle says -2.5 to 5J AGIO but I like mine. Mine is the highest scoring play too!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ADIL 13C DIAL +17 190
>Jonathan_Lindh: IKOOSUU 4L KOI +26 157
#note 2nd best play! A1 OIK I think is better. -9. Gotta know the new words.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ERSTV O1 VERST +36 226
#note It also doesn't give up this play by Tim. Could Tim have had a bingo?
>Jonathan_Lindh: LOOQSUU 1A PUS +25 182
#note No rack available. What I had was bad.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: NOZ 2L ZON. +26 252
>Jonathan_Lindh: AILOOQU 6L DUO +14 196
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: DRY 4F DRY +18 270
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIORST A1 .OETISER +83 279
#note Best play! I was 80-90% sure on this and hoped it would draw a challenge. Tim challenged POETIZES in the 565 game.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EILNNST -  +0 270
#note He challenged this too! Unsuccessful challenge.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACENOST K1 CON +19 298
#note I like H1 CONY for 27 here. Quackle likes fishing off the O for 2k OZONE for 14. My play isn't that good. I HATE racks like this when there is no playable bingo but have bingoable tiles! -11.2
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ILL H1 ILL. +21 291
#note CONY CONY CONY!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEGIST 12C AG +15 313
#note 2nd best play! Quackle likes blowing up the rack with G6 AGNATE for 25 but I prefer this play. -1.1 but I'd do this again.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: AQ 7C QA. +25 316
#note Apparently I prevented a massive Q play from Tim on the last turn.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEIST 3G A.E +8 321
#note 4th best play! 3G ELAIN keeping AEST is best for 10. I think it's immaterial. -2.2 but I'd do it again.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: BHU B10 HUB +22 338
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIINST 14E ISATINE +73 394
#note Best play! And only bingo!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EIW H12 WI.E +33 371
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BCELRT 15K TRaCE +23 417
#note This play is bad. It was late in the game. Quackle likes 15A BRACT keeping EL for 36. I actually like M1 BOLO taking away Tim's one place to score well given his lack of vowels. Of course how do you know what he has if you MESSED UP ON YOUR TRACKING FOR THE 100TH TIME! Lol! -18.2 says Quackle I don't think its that bad but I don't like this play at all.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: MNNPR M1 M.N. +12 383
#note 6th best play! When I saw Tim's leftover letters, I asked why not POMO in the same spot for 16. That is best. -9.2 for Tim.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BL 1G L.B +5 422
#note 2nd best play! I didn't see K12 BLET. Bad bad endgame. But great comeback!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (NPR) +10 432
