>Norma: AAORRUY H8 ARRAY +24 24
>Josh: AQU 11E AQU. +26 26
>Norma: AEKLOPU 12A POLKA +30 54
#note I didn't remember if PULKA+ was a word :(. Better hit the books. Also 12H (Y)APOK
>Josh: GINPU A10 UP.ING +33 59
>Norma: EEINOSU I11 EON +23 77
#note Not fishing here. 
>Josh: ACNOTU B5 TOUCAN +16 75
>Norma: CEILOSU A1 OCULI +26 103
#note O(C)ULI is better for me, but A1 OCULI is definitely much worse for my opponent. Turns out she had a definite best play that I blocked. 
>Josh: ABIIMN 8A A.INI +24 99
>Norma: EHLMSTT C7 H.M +31 134
>Josh: ABEMS C1 BEAMS +21 120
>Norma: ELNRSTT B1 RET +24 158
>Josh: EGHIRST 1A ...ITERS +33 153
#note Actual rack. Norma was unhappy to have missed the bingos here, and after this play knew she had made a mistake.
>Norma: DLNORST 4C .OLD +14 172
#note Hmm, I should have played F1 (E)LD perhaps, but I hated scoring so few.
>Josh: EGH 2E EH +28 181
#note lucky that H wasn't an X.
>Norma: FGNRSTZ 8G Z.RF +16 188
#note It was quite bizarre here to choose between E6 FR(I)Z and 8G Z(A)RF. I quickly dismissed E7 F(I)Z, since the leave is much less flexible with the R in there, although strong for bingos. I ultimately decided that with two blanks out, no indication that she had an S, and a very fragile lead, I needed to try and make something happen here. I'm not really ahead anyway given the looming threats. 
>Josh: IIII -IIII +0 181
#note It also helped that I knew Norma was vowel heavy from her kibitzing. 
>Norma: ADGNNST K4 DANGS +31 219
>Josh: DEEY G3 DYE +20 201
>Norma: EEFNSTT L1 FETE +28 247
#note Just like that I'm in quite good shape. ZARF paid off. Lucky to have drawn the case S and confirmed my suspicions that ORBITERS did not keep another S. 
>Josh: OW F4 .OW +17 218
>Norma: ?AIINST M3 ANImIST +74 321
#note And a blank to boot! I missed (G)IANTISm here, but was close to it when I dismissed GITANISM* in my search for the scoring-est bingo. M3 INTImAS is 2 fewer but more defensive, enough so that the point sacrifice is overthrown. Also, sacrificing 10 points at M3 is very strong as well for board control, but I'm ready to just outrun her here. What could go wrong?
>Josh: EIJV N1 JIVE +39 257
>Norma: DLRTVWX N1 ....D +19 340
#note Whoa. What an unexpected draw! I didn't see a way for Norma to win after this, though, since I will outrun her if she has OBlIGEE N9 this turn, and if she fishes and hits it next turn I will have a vowel to block her at 8M. I missed GOBONEE and BESIEGE, as well as BOOGIES and BOOGIED though, and after the came thought they might have been a threat. Seems this is my best bet anyhow. Quackle suggests 5J D(A) has a higher winning%, but I cannot see anything that blocks or accomplishes that JIVED does not. Anyone?
>Josh: ?BEEEGO N9 OBEsE +14 271
#note Norma revealed the remaining tile in the bag by shaking it upside down, and I told her she was lucky it didn't matter and that this wasn't a tournament. I guess I was a bit harsh... :P
