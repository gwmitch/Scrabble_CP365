#note saw LIGATED but thought that keeping DT would be more conducive to bingoing. sim results suggest that I score well anyway after LIGATED, so take points now.

#note one of the most difficult plays of the day. I saw OUZO, but didn't want to create such an easy lane after what looked like a fishing play on his part. I liked that I have a chance to score by hooking DITZY next turn. my play seems reasonable
>Bruce_Ward: ?CELNRU I1 LUCeRNE +69 253
#note I saw that he could've played LUCARNE, but thought he may have gotten confused. Very costly challenged - if I just accept this play and play WOS/TANDOORI Q suggests I'm 80% to win, but instead I turn the end of the game into a coin flip. poor challenge!

#note nice play, this is his full rack
>JD: EEFJLST 5L JEF. +14 369
#note the pool looked good, so it seemed really important to block column N - and I save a good leave, so I may even be able to bingo myself if he opens.
>Bruce_Ward: ADEIRST 6M DE +15 369
#note quackle suggests just fishing the D, after which I have the tough task on my hands of blocking bingos from the F like FRIGATES/FAIRIEST while still scoring decently. Bruce played the E to save the A for column B bingos. not really sure what he should do.
