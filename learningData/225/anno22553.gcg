#note I actually was under the impression that this didn't take the S - may have challenged if it came up.

>JD: EGJMPRT F2 J.G +27 111
#note great synergy of MP, sims better than JIMP as I had thought. EMPRT bingos 46% versus 34% with EGRT

#note MOM is just a hair better.

#note definitely not every day that the top two sim results score 55 and 6 points respectively! the R is a very valuable tile with only one left, so playing KAMES is way better - missed it for some reason. the other two improvements are BIRDSHOTS/SEX (which I wouldn't want to risk here) and fishing KA at 8C, which averages 79! points per turn and bingos 80% of the time.

#note ouch
>JD: AAIILOT 15G TOI. +23 296
#note I was all set to play ALA or TALA on row 15, but ended up picking TOIT because I disliked having to play through the two Is on this tight board. A sim suggests this is almost defensible, but prefers the greedy TALA for points or IOTA at 15C which I overlooked. I think the latter play is best.
>Mike_Frentz: ADFOTU 13G FAD.OUT +48 351
#note huge play which ALA fortuitously would've blocked.
>JD: AAGILUV L11 UV.LA +18 314
#note I am perhaps lucky that VAGINULA# didn't fit, since I would've tried it. I wanted to dig for the goodies in the bag (the S or the blank), and AAGIL after LUV felt far from bingoing, although really none of my plays get me very close according to a sim. I think either try is reasonable.
>Mike_Frentz: HIW 4C WHI. +26 377
#note he played his previous move so fast that I thought he had to have the blank - otherwise it would surely be a tougher decision.
>JD: ADEGIPS 3B PA +18 332
#note I was running super-low on time and didn't come up with a better play, but I don't really need to open a new lane, probably - instead, Q suggests playing 3 or 4 tiles with GAWP or PEAG at 5B, because the G really hurts the synergy of my rack. I think emptying the bag is probably wrong, so GAWP looks like a good shot. But at least the new lane gives mike a new threat to worry about with the potential OPA hook - he may possibly wind block the wrong spot.
>Mike_Frentz: ?EIOORU 4L .O +14 391
#note from mike's perspective he's a heavy favorite - in many cases after this play he will bingo out on the left hand side of the board or from the B. The bingos I can have here are EYELIDS, EDGIEST, ISLETED and ELEGIST. This play wins 69/72 - he loses if he draws the Y and I play ELEGIST or EDGIEST, or if he draws the G and I play ISLETED. Sid Murali points out a play that wins 35/36 - ROOSE at N10, which only leaves ISLETED. But in a game situation, it can be difficult to confirm that you've actually mapped out all the possible bingo threats.
