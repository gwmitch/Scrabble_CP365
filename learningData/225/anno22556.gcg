#note October 25th Chicago Scrabble Episode 4: Press the Button! In Episode 4, we see the genius of Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man at work again.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDIOTWX 9E TIX +40 40
#note Best play! Another perfect start! After all, I'm not Mr. -999.9 Point Opening Play Man I'm Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man!
>Dan_Terkell: DEILNSW 7G WINDLES +86 112
#note Best play by Dan! He played very well this game! I'm not sure I did.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDMNOUW 8L MOWN +45 85
#note Best play!
>Dan_Terkell: IZ N8 .IZ +35 147
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDETTUU 9K DUC. +23 108
#note Best play! I had no clude what to do here so I'm glad I played this one right.
>Dan_Terkell: EE K9 .EE +8 155
>Jonathan_Lindh: ERRTTUU 12K TRUER +17 125
#note 12th best play! I was trying to block. Yeah 12k RUT is best. Wouldn't stop what came next. -4.6
>Dan_Terkell: ACDEENT 11D ANTECED. +72 227
#note Best play! And only bingo! Dan played REALLY well this game s I publicly tip my hat to him. I held this for a very time and wiselt talked myself out of challenging.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGHOSTU 12B JIB +32 157
#note I somehow didn't write my rack down on the pivotal play of the game. I held an O in addition to this and I was close to STOURIE the next turn. I kept an O to underlap. It would proof costly because I would have had STOURIE the next turn if I played JOB and Dan doesn't block. This probably was the right call in theory. In practise it backfired. HORRIBLY.
>Dan_Terkell: AIK O12 .AKI +24 251
>Jonathan_Lindh: EOORSTU 13A ROTO +26 183
#note B12 JOE is apparently best. Too fishy for me. My play is back but only -4.7. I like mine OK.
>Dan_Terkell: AIOT H11 .OATI +24 275
>Jonathan_Lindh: EFGNOSU G13 FUG +25 208
#note Best play! I seem to be playing REALLY well so far. One minor mistake and something I couldn't predict backfiring backfiring.
>Dan_Terkell: ADH I13 HAD +32 307
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEQR M11 Q.ARE +28 236
#note Another rack I didn't write down. I had a Q and no U so I'm pretty sure this is best.
>Dan_Terkell: ALRV E4 VARL.. +18 325
#note Did Dan have an S here? This seems WAY to risky with a blank and a few S's out with a commaning lead. It worked out for him in the end, but I made him pay on this turn.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AINNOS 4C iN.ASION +72 308
#note Best play! However with his rack O1 SANtONIN is clearly best because it doesn't give him a spot for his beautiful bingo.
>Dan_Terkell: BEEHOPS 3G EPHEBOS +106 431
#note Best play! Dan incorrectly scored his play as 105. This is still an insane play though. I held for a minute in complete shock. Dan is playing like a 1900 player this game. Can I have my last play back?
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEILPUY L1 PL.YE +26 334
#note 4L YIPE. -16.9. Mine is way back. Like Lebron's hairline. First really big mistake of the game. And it's the endgame! So it's time for Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man!
>Dan_Terkell: AGLO 1H GALO. +24 455
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIMRSU 6B EMI.S +11 345
#note Umm, the sad thing is I spent about 5 minutes on this. I don't know what I was thinking. AT ALL. This play needs a warning DO NOT VIEW IF PREGNANT. I'm sorry if any babies were conceived to this awful play. My horrible endgames weren't meant to be Marvin Gaye. 15A SEMIRIGID for 42 is beautiful and the best play. -35.9 to SEMIRIGID but only -9 to next best play. All and all this game was only -60 equity and -52 came on the last two plays when the game was decided anyways. I don't think this game was winnable. The other 6 were. I won 3.5.
>Dan_Terkell: ?FOTY 2C FOoTY +18 473
#note 2C TOfFY for 24 was best for Dan. His was tied for 2nd best.
>Dan_Terkell:  (IRU) +6 479
#note Score recorded as 478-343 Dan. When a terrible endgame is near, Mr. -999.9 Point Endgame Man is here!
