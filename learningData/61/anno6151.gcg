>Jim_Burlant: AILNOPW 8G WOP +16 16
#note Sim winner is 8H PILAW.  This choice comes in fourth, roughly 2 points down.
>Scott_Smith: ADEG I6 GA.ED +11 11
>Jim_Burlant: AHILNOW J9 HOWL +22 38
#note Quackle prefers 9F HOW(E) 22, docking me 2 points for this choice.  Against this opponent it's going to be obvious that I have to place a premium on keeping things open.
>Scott_Smith: OX 12J .OX +20 31
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEIKN H5 KA +9 47
#note Was going to play AlKALINE through the L in HOWL but this play killed that.  Didn't know IKEBANA and would never have found that.  Quackle doesn't like this play very much but it gets the job done quite nicely.  I've got the blank - why not play aggressively?
>Scott_Smith: EEEPR G8 .EEPER +13 44
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIINR 4H sENARII +68 115
#note Or at 14G.  I'd rather take out the line I just created and not leave him an easy S or O hook.
>Scott_Smith: GNY 6G N..GY +14 58
>Jim_Burlant: EEILLOU K10 LO.IE +24 139
#note Best, nothing else comes within 5 points in the sim.  Not thrilled about the E next to the 14J TL, but too many points here not to take them.
>Scott_Smith: AEG 11E GA.E +14 72
>Jim_Burlant: ELOQSTU 15F QUOTES +51 190
#note Or TOQUES.
>Scott_Smith: EFT 14J F.ET +28 100
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEILN D8 DELaINE +75 265
#note Highest valuation, though if Quackle is to be believed, any number of E4 bingos (NEEDLInG, sEEDLING, etc.) win a hair more - as in 0.01%. I think it's safe to say that we can disregard that in this game; it's over except for the final score already.
>Scott_Smith: ACT 15M ACT +17 117
>Jim_Burlant: AACMNOS N1 MAN.AC +32 297
#note Didn't know maniocas; too bad.     I'm at 99% winning chances even if the equity loss is horrific.  I'm just looking to turn tiles as quickly as I can and end this game.  
>Scott_Smith: ILMNNOS -ILMNN +0 117
>Jim_Burlant: FHJNOSZ 15A FOHS +42 339
#note The answer to the obvious question you're all asking is, "No, I have no shame."  This wasn't so much as held.  The duck says I can't lose this game now.
>Scott_Smith: MO O1 OM +28 145
>Jim_Burlant: IIJNNTZ 13A JIN. +22 361
>Scott_Smith: BIISTTY -  +0 145
#note I don't have this recorded correctly - Scott exchanged here but I'm not sure how many, so I just told Quackle to pass.

>Jim_Burlant: EILNRTZ K3 Z.N. +32 393
#note Too lazy to think of LAZY in the same location.  . :-)
