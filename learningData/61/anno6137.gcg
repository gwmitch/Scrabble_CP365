#note I was so hypnotized by the hook opportunities that I failed to consider the parallel plays. ONO is a nice score with a great leave and awesome defense. Need to wake up.

#note As you can see, I have a bingo lined up in the same spot. I also don't remember this word from studying DRRP bingoes. But I just kept trying to justify it. Coming up with stupid sentences in which UPROARED# might be a word. How costly was allowing this? Well, Kevin got 83 points, blocked my 80 point bingo, I took 0 next turn, and Kevin drew the second blank. All of that was preventable if I just had the stones to challenge this off. Honestly, there were so many reasons to challenge, I can't believe I allowed it. It just seemed so plausible and he could have just made the blank an S. I so knew it was phony! Why did I allow this?!?!? *cry*
