#note SHEIK?  Q, you're smoking.

>Daniel_Stock: EFJ H1 JEF. +42 124
>Ryan_Fischer: EMRUUWW -MUUWW +0 114
#note I really doubt playing MEW, keeping RUUW, is going to lead to anywhere good.  Or RUM(P) leaving EUWW.  So I punted.  You thought just ONE WU was bad!

>Ryan_Fischer: EINPRRS 11D R.PINERS +70 216
#note Come to think of it, I should've thought this over a bit more.  I didn't know his whole rack.  PRIN(T)ERS prevents him from bingoing, but I couldn't know that.
>Daniel_Stock: EEIMNNR K7 REIN.MEN +60 208
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILWXY L12 ILEX +50 266
#note Pretty bad, missing (E)XILE with the same tiles.  Don't know why I did that.

#note I think I played WITTED instead of WITED for 2 comeback spots.  Who knows if it was smart.

#note B2 FR(I)V(O)L is even flashier and better!
>Daniel_Stock: BOS 1L BO.S +36 406
>Ryan_Fischer: EEORSUV 10A .VE +14 411
#note With this pool, I was feeling pretty confident.  Save the U for Q insurance, right?  Maybe I should have looked to block, instead.  I didn't even think to stop something like QU(A)G.  Lotsa one-tile dumps rank.  Considered (NE)VE, but he may have an R, too.
