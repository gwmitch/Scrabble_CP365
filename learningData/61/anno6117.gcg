>Joey: ?DEEISU H6 DE.UrIES +61 136
#note It's a close call between JEU and bingo-ing.  ESQUIRED is a bit better defensively.

#note I had to gulp hard before challenging this, as the great Jim Kramer would say.
>Scott: ABELRTY --  -80 188
>Joey: AAGLNRS 14I RAGLANS +72 255
#note Having this bingo blocked made it easier to challenge, although I noticed later that I still had GARLANDS 6B available, which would have given him RATEABLY/BETRAYAL.  What a sequence.
>Scott: ABELRTY 15G BRAY +35 223
>Joey: AEFIUVZ 6D FUZE. +38 293
#note I don't think I noticed the simple 70-point ZA/ZAX during the game.  But I liked blocking this lane and dumping more letters.
>Scott: ELT D4 LE.T +14 237
>Joey: AIRVVWW O12 VI.A +33 326
#note While the leave looks dreadful, the last O would give me some great scoring an options.

>Scott: ?AEHINN L3 E..N +4 313
#note I think this was Scott's rack.  If so, he had PHENAZIN!  Still, this was a very clever setup that wasn't easily blocked.
