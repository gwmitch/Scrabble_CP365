#note h1 (MINIM)I(ZED) is fun - the four plays better than mine all spot this - 6g BI, TIE(D), TI or AI.

#note worst case scenario after me playing OBIA
>james: AEEIJRT 12J AJEE +24 306
#note weak play. lots of TIED variants in the MINIMIZED spot that i missed. next other best play is e7 J(AG)E(R).  N1 JE(T) and 7c (T)AJ follow that, then my play. (groan)

#note was fishing for an N column bingo or something from the M - probably wrong time. Q likes TIN(D)ER for 40 at g6 but i'm blind to that spot.  the only play liked that doesnt utilize that is L10 VO(E) which does pretty well - probably as it prevents what Anita is about to do.

#note another desperation setup. does better than anything that doesnt use MINIMIZED.
