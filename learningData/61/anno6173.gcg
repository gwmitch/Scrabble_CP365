#note Best.  Nothing else sims within 10 points.

>Jim_Burlant: AIINOTY J10 YA +28 64
#note Not thrilled about keeping duplicated I's, but this and COPAY 7I duke it out for sim winner honors.  J10 AYIN and L11 YONI finish a little further back.

#note Was hoping to play POINTIER on row 5 but so much for that.    Having played Lois before, I know that the board tends to shut down quickly against her and I wanted to make sure things stayed open.  While this play finishes 4th in the sim, it does so at a loss of nearly 8 points to L8 YIP, the sim winner.

>Jim_Burlant: EEINNOR M3 ENO. +8 86
#note Quackle prefers 7K PEON ...uh...no thanks.  Why would I open the triple line for an S I don't have in my rack with 3 unseen?

#note The only playable bingo.  I'm now at 68% winning chances.

#note Best.
>Lois_Oda: BNU 8D BUN +17 139
>Jim_Burlant: ?LMNORT 10F MO +24 224
#note Highest valuation play, this finishes second on a win percentage basis by roughly 1/2% to D11 ENORM.  I'd rather keep both sides of row 15 alive for 8's, especially since I'm sitting on the blank.
>Lois_Oda: AH L3 HA +19 158
>Jim_Burlant: ?FLNORT 12A FOiL +53 277
#note If you don't know or can't find FRONTLET, do you burn the blank here?  The sim says yes and this is the best choice of the non-bingo options, not even giving up 2-1/2 points to the bingo after 1200+ 2-ply iterations.  I had considered L11 LOFT 17 and felt that 36 points was too much to give up to hold the blank.  I also felt that increasing my lead to 119 points would put that much more pressure on her.  I'm now at  96% winning chances btw.
>Lois_Oda: OW F6 WO. +14 172
>Jim_Burlant: EHIINRT L11 HI +16 293
#note Interesting sim result.  This is the highest valuation play according to Quackle and it wins 98.5%.  Yet it finishes 4th in win percentage to L10 THEIR, which wins 98.8.  I'd make this play again in a second.  
>Lois_Oda: ADRV 15E RAV.D +9 181
>Jim_Burlant: EINRRST G9 R.. +6 299
#note So much for my planned row 15 bingo.  But the best is yet to come.  This play sims best btw.
>Lois_Oda: DEENRTU G1 RETUNED +71 252
#note This play brings Lois back up to 7% winning chances...but it's safe to say my next rack takes them back down to 0.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST 1A TRAINE.S +131 430
#note It doesn't get luckier than fishing off an R from EINRRST and drawing an A.  My eyes got as wide as saucers when I saw her slot the R at G1.
>Lois_Oda: F 2F F. +26 278
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGIJL E4 GIE +14 444
#note Now I'm just moving tiles to end the game; I guess I've kind of shut down now that the game is a done deal.
