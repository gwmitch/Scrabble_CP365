#note Set up THILL or HILLO?  I don't know.  Q likes LO 9H best.

#note M(O)PP(E)T.  Wow.  Missed some better plays aside AQUAE.  This is just okay.  Through an H I saw PEMPHIX.  Woulda been fun.
>Dorcas_Alexander: DIK 4L DI.K +28 181
>Ryan_Fischer: EEJOPTT 12D JET +26 195
#note I miscounted JET above, but I'm glad I did.  Helps me come back later.  I don't think JEEP leaving OTT is much better either.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?CELNSV 15B ENCLaV.S +65 246
#note At H2 for 2 more; maybe she didn't want to open that much.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIOPTT 7B TIPTOED +71 266
#note Thank you Doug Brockmeier for playing this on me.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ABENOST C2 BOTAN.ES +72 318
#note Just a little disparity between hers and my post bingo draws!
>Ryan_Fischer: GMNNRWZ 5A WR.NG +18 284
#note Ew.  I was pretty much feeling hopeless here.
>Dorcas_Alexander: FLO O1 FOL. +33 351
>Ryan_Fischer: AABIMNZ 3I ZAMIA +59 343
#note What fortune! BANZAI on the rack, no go.  This, MAZIN(G), and NIZAM all help.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ACOR 4F ORCA +20 371
>Ryan_Fischer: BEINUVY 14J BUYIN. +36 379
#note More fortune.  Pretty insane.
>Dorcas_Alexander: RU 2A RU. +10 381
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGHOV 8A VO. +20 399
#note I was happy with how I played this endgame until I realized I left the door open for her to bingo, and there were two playable ones she had.  I opted to take VOE first, leaving two spots to score with the H.  As long as she can't bingo across row 6, I'll be fine!  Champ doesn't find it, but it sims 3rd behind AGAVE in two places.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?DEIORR 6F DROnER +29 410
#note She had bROIDER and gRODIER to go out.  I shoulda been more cautious.
