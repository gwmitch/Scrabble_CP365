#note The worst bingo for obvious reasons, but the only one I could decipher.

#note Focused on blocking the hook, which I didn't really accomplish. Vitrain in the same spot is sweet, but it wasn't in my vocabulary. "Trivial" is also a nice rack clearer, but "airlift" is too many points to pass up.

#note Quackle's not a fan of this. Prefers a number of plays ridding the U. I didn't even check -ful words. I rejected "Ha" and "Ahi" on the G Column, but Quackle thinks they're good plays. Didn't even notice (F)I(G)HT or Tarrif.

#note Reticule! Crap. I deserve to lose now. I was going to fish and play "clue", but settled on this. Still don't know if it's better, but I know what it's worse than!

#note Yeah I'm playing with fire, and that's probably not a good idea against Q.
>Quackle: ADEINNR C1 NARDINE +76 244
#note I seriously didn't even take note of that hook, after wasting a turn trying to limit the use of fluorine. Doh.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINOSTY A11 TONEY +38 304
#note Not going to play the fishing game - I'll probably get the Q or something.

#note Quackle likes it - I thought I was commiting suicide.

#note I had no idea what to do here. The problem was, I failed to see odea/ax. I thought ex/ex was the best x play. So I considered nowt for the longest time. But then I saw Q had P(E)AG for a decent score. I just settled on going out in 2 turns in some form, instead of dragging this out. Turns out, if I play nowt, Q responds with (H)M. The heck? Oh, apparantly I can go out with tenuis/axe, which hurts spread I guess. Why not P(E)AG, though? Trying to keep odea/ax for later? Assuming I saw that play, I can block it, though, and then quackle plays peag anyways.

#note Why did I think fug was bad? Why did I beat quackle is a better question!
