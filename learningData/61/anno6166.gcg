#note j2 position is better, though this sets up a volatile board in a game i need to win by 78 to win the tourney

#note i thought about 5h BOU(C)HEE but though i was getting confused with the Flyers goalie.  7h BE(A)U is 2nd and next is g11 HEBE that i considered - but i wanted an open board.  i need to think harder here not to leave myself with such a crappy leave.

#note ties with N10 VINOU(S) and VENOU(S) which i didnt see - i looked to find J plays from that spot. If i'd seen the V plays, i'd have taken them in a shot over JUN.  especially considering what happens next

#note dont know why i put the N on the end - i paused and then decided to. Q likes playing 12L VI(B)E but i'm not sure what to think here.

#note plays from 8L - HUNK, HAKU or HAIK actually have a marginally better % win (by 1%), but i wanted to avoid blocking the M column bingo line
>mr_ulu: AEOOTTT 1A TATTOOE. +80 396
#note held, but accepted regretfully. a nice find.
>james: ADEFILO 2E IF +28 290
#note i saw the bingo here and wasn't 100% (FOLIAGED).  i should've just gone with it - it might have made the end a bit more interesting. my play only sims 0.2% win worse - still seeing a bingo and not playing it is quite annoying.

#note missed 15a ALNICO - i guess i'd mentally checked out at this point. M5 NICOL is cute (though 12 points fewer than ALNICO).

#note a6 TO(M)ES scores 4 more, but this is a nice find too.  Congrats to Deen.
