>Cornelis: ESSSTVX H7 VEXT +28 28
#note Lou's actual rack. Looks like VEXT is correct, but Lou thought hard about VESTS.
>Tunnicliffe: ?BEHOPT G8 BO +19 19
#note As you can see, I would have preferred VESTS.
>Cornelis: EOSSS F8 OSE +20 48
>Tunnicliffe: ?EHJPTT E10 PHT +20 39
#note I thought this was the only play, but I didn't see JOSEPH or HEPTOSE. Quackle likes PHT, though.
>Cornelis: AQSS 12C QA. +24 72
>Tunnicliffe: ?EEIJNT 13B JIN +44 83
>Cornelis: ELSS 14C SEL +18 90
>Tunnicliffe: ?EEEOTU -EEOU +0 83
#note In hindsight, TUTEE would probably give me a better shot to bingo.
>Cornelis: DIPS A13 DIP +30 120
>Tunnicliffe: ?EENRTW E2 TWeENER +74 157
>Cornelis: ?ACEIIS 2A CAvI.IES +72 192
>Tunnicliffe: ADEIRUY 1G YAUD +35 192
>Cornelis: AAGINST 15E AGAINST +76 268
>Tunnicliffe: EFIKLRW 4A KREW. +32 224
#note Not sure I understand why A1 ICK is simming best. Save the FW for the D column hot spots??
>Cornelis: EMOU 14H MEOU +20 288
>Tunnicliffe: AAFILLU 10H .UFA +15 239
#note Chickening out on KALIF is weak. That's a lot of points to give up.
>Cornelis: ABEY 11J ABYE +31 319
>Tunnicliffe: AILLOTZ 12J TAO +27 266
#note This play doesn't make any sense. I obviously missed ZOEAL, and I think I reasoned that I needed to take these points and score with the Z later and then work a bingo in there. I really dug myself into a hole bungling this rack and missing KALIF last turn.
>Cornelis: EHIT A4 .ITHE +36 355
>Tunnicliffe: ILLMORZ 13L MOLL +20 286
#note I considered M10 ME, but I didn't like my odds of getting the E or A. Really, though, it was my best chance.
>Cornelis: ADLO O11 AL.OD +21 376
>Tunnicliffe: DFIORRZ B8 FIZ +40 326
>Cornelis: OR 5C RO. +10 386
>Tunnicliffe: DEINORR J1 .OR +6 332
#note Quackle says M9 ROE is my best shot at bingoing.
>Cornelis: CGINRU 4H CURING +29 415
>Tunnicliffe: DEEINRV M1 VEN.ED +22 354
#note Missed the outbingo INNERVED. Was mostly looking through the G, though.
>Cornelis: GN 7D G.N +8 423
