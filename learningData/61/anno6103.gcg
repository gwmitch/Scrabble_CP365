#note or F6 VU(G)G. vugg is probably better cuz of the synergy and defense. but quackle likes kamikaze-zar.

#note i can't make mistakes like that. i'm buckling down and learning the words as cold as i can, but it's not good to chicken out on petrolic and completely miss leprotic. i've gone through that set. i just don't know it cold. but that's what a STEE does! -22

#note david called this play insane. i don't think it's that insane. he's clearly going to block at 15F and then i'm going to be screwed. i can't hope to outscore him because he's a tempo ahead, the  blank is still unseen, and i have to make it as volatile as possible. right? quackle likes 5E ROM(E)O, which makes no sense because it closes another bingo lane (that is hard to hit, but still) and i'm not going to achieve anything. L12 MOON also sims a tiny bit better than my play, but i don't like it because that's the lane he has to block. i basically have no shot without doing N1 MOON, and i'm standing by that play. (-3) I mean, he can only really hurt me if he has something like AWE, and after YEW, FE, OX, it's unlikely he has yet another worst-case response.

#note ok, i think i'm screwed. i couldn't figure out how to open another bingo lane without getting totally outscored. SUZERAINS is pretty interesting.

#note ok, i guess tropical does take an S :P (i actually was going to try it if it came down to desperation, but i didn't think of dISTAIN in that spot!) pretty big miss. -11
>Pearl: ADEEHIO 1A DO.H +36 428
>Cesar: AABITUV 13I VA.UTA +26 441
#note i see no way to win this game without a minor miracle, like drawing the S and good tiles to go out. 13J ULVA sims second highest but it just scores too low. at least i have the B for the 13C spot!
>Pearl: EEGIPST 13C P.E +27 455
#note i believe david wasn't sure of the S hook on VALUTA and a bunch of plays there would have won it for him, or just blocking. i'm not sure if he didn't see or count hobo. GETA N10 wins it without knowing the S hook. i was very fortunate.
