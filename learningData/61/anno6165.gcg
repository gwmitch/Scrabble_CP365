#note two double-doubles available - INEA(R)THS & (A)STHENIA, but i think Deen is right to take out the O column here
>james: BEGOOSY 12A BOYO +42 150
#note i saw BOOGEYS and chickened out on it. I asked Deen if he thought it good after the game and he said he'd challenge - we looked it up and it's good. If i didnt have BOYO for a nice alternative, i think i would've pulled the trigger on it.

>james: EEGHLSV E3 VEG +24 174
>mr_ulu: AALU K7 AU.AL +10 155
#note Deen took a long time on this play - not sure of his rack but i'd be interested.
>james: EHLOPQS L4 QOPH +41 215
#note i was going to play Q(O)PH until Deen played AU(R)AL.  His play gave me a no brainer of QOPH, and also meant i was now playing very fast and his clock was running down.
>mr_ulu: Y J9 .Y +26 181
#note i think Deen said he missed RETIARY on this move
>james: ADELSSW C3 DEW +26 241
#note q prefers c2 SLEW or M5 WAS (which i'm not doing without holding the X).
>mr_ulu: ?EIIRRT J1 dIRTIER +66 247
#note 3 better bingos but none are easy finds at all.  15h FERRITI(N) and n3 or n2 TIRRIVEE - i didnt know either.  Or, 14h cRITERI(A).

>mr_ulu: IMRT B1 TRIM +23 316
>james: EEFNRUU O1 REF +28 385
#note i just wanted to get points and this sims joint 2nd with O1 FEE.  The best play is g3 REFUE(L) according to Q - but blocking a possible X play at O3 seems reasonable.
>mr_ulu: UV 11K .UV +6 322
>james: ELNOTUU 1A U.E +9 394
#note champ player says 7b OU(T) or h1 (J)UT or (J)UN
>mr_ulu: N L11 .N +4 326
>james: KLNOTUX 14D TUX +33 427
#note m11 (V)OX does the same job of blocking Deen's out bingoes of GECKOES, CONGEES or CHEGOES with slightly better equity.
>mr_ulu: ?CEEGOS 13I ClOSE +21 347
#note deen is now at about -1s
>james: KLNO 5I K.N. +16 443
>mr_ulu: EG 3E .EG +9 356
#note 7h GE(RAH) or 7f (B)EG score 15, but deen was over time - i forgot to take 10 off his score for time so the score here was the final one.
