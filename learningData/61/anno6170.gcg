#note He really went into the tank on that turn.  Decision time.  I should really block.  Q suggests dumping the L, keeping the highly potent EIQRSU.  I should just play QU(A) and lock it down.  Instead I took the points, and put myself in a sticky situation.

#note Well, I made the right play for the wrong reason, giving me a 1/6 chance of pulling an E for OUTLINER.  I was just trying to delay the end, though I figured I couldn't outscore him.  I had given up the game for lost, basically, especially if he had the W.
