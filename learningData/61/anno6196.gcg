#note I wasn't paying enough attention to this and I realized a few turns later that I'd been had.  As for this play - I wanted to play DIXIT to open up and turn more of the rack, but felt I had to take the points, and Quackle agrees.  But the fun was just beginning.

>Jim_Burlant: ADILTVY A7 VI.Y +30 65
#note Only saw the homeless VALIDITY, didn't know DATIVELY, and couldn't see VANITY or any of the better plays.  Looking back, I entered this game with somet emotional fatigue from my first two games.  Between that, Katya's hot start, and my only seeing an orphaned bingo in this rack, I'm rattled.  And it shows in this poor play.
>Katya_Lezin: MM 7G MM +20 143
>Jim_Burlant: ABDFGLT E5 DAG. +25 90
#note Still rattled.  Too bad I couldn't think of FAGOT in the same location...but it wouldn't have made much difference beyond a few more points.
>Katya_Lezin: IQ D4 QI +25 168
>Jim_Burlant: ABFLRTT -BFLT +0 90
#note Best play, the sim winner.
>Katya_Lezin: EV 6E .VE +19 187
>Jim_Burlant: AEJLRTY F8 .AJ +26 116
#note Ugh - if I hadn't thrown the normally rancid F back into the bag.  Now I can't open up the top half of the board.  Anyway - I didn't like this play at all - the ELRTY leave is nothing to write home about, there are 5 A's at large, and if she has one she's got the all-too-easy hook.  But did I really have a choice?
>Katya_Lezin: EKO 10F .OKE +15 202
>Jim_Burlant: ELNNRTY J10 YEN +41 157
#note Couldn't think of TYNE, the sim winner.  I'm holding steady at 15% here. 
>Katya_Lezin: EFU K11 FEU +24 226
>Jim_Burlant: CGLNNRT -CGLN +0 157
#note Best exchange per the duck is to keep CN.  Quackle doesn't like this much, but given my next draw it really wouldn't have helped a whole lot.
>Katya_Lezin: HT 11I H..T +15 241
>Jim_Burlant: INNPRTT L8 TIN. +5 162
#note Where are the vowels?  Best play here is a second straight exchange, with exchange NPRT winning the sim.  I was worried that the board would be completely dead if I took another doughnut.  Not that 5 points is a whole lot, but at least this play turns 3 and keeps things open.  And surely her next play will be to the triple and open some lines for 8's.  I'm at 6-1/2% winning chances.
>Katya_Lezin: IPR 8L .RIP +18 259
>Jim_Burlant: BINOPRT 13K .PO +10 172
#note N6 BORT keeping PINR and 13K URB fight it out for sim winner honors.  I was still focused on keepng lines open for 8's against this opponent, who will play much more defensively than Quackle.  BORT and URB sim at roughly 5.5% winning chances - this play comes in at 3-1/2.
>Katya_Lezin: HILLS K4 HILLS +23 282
>Jim_Burlant: ?BILNRT N11 LINT +14 186
#note Quackle likes L3 NIT or L3 BIN but I feld I should make her defend a bit - I mean, really - do I have any choice now but to open up dangerous hooks and hope I beat her to them?  If I put down or BIN L3, I guarantee she'd just overlap it if I played there.   Not sure why I didn't play BINT here, though.  
>Katya_Lezin: AAGL 11C GALA +21 303
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCNNOR D10 B.RN +12 198
#note Now I'm crossing the line - I'm not just drawing badly; I'm playing badly.  By this point I'm just beside myself that despite turning 4, none of those E's are making it into my racks.  Sim winner here is D10 CARBON, which I'm not sure I agree with - why burn the C when I've got that juicy hook at K3?  The play that makes the most sense - which I didn't look hard enough to find - is NOB12B.  
>Katya_Lezin: AG 10L .AG +18 321
>Jim_Burlant: ?CNOOOU C11 .OO +14 212
#note I prefer to leave the top of the board alone because I've got that C hook.  L4 ONO wins the sim; my winning chances here are 1.5%.
>Katya_Lezin: ESTW 15L WEST +40 361
>Jim_Burlant: ?CNORSU -U +0 212
#note By this point I've just about completely unraveled, and as a result  I whiff on this rack.  UNCORkS, cONCURS, UNCROSs - these were all there for me and I just missed them all. Best bingo here gives me 3% winning chances.

>Katya_Lezin: ATU L2 UTA +16 377
>Jim_Burlant: ?CENORS 2H RECO.NtS +80 292
#note Ironic that the one exchange I make that's completely unnecessary is the only one that goes well.  Yeah, it would have been good if I found UNCORkS, cONCURS, or UNCROSs on the previous rack.  But she already had the second blank by then, so it would have just been 20 or 30 points' reduction in the spread.
