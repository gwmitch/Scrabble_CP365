>james: CEJMNOR H7 J.MON +14 14
#note MOJ(O) sims best. i wanted to give myself a nice leave early in the game .... i also thought (not 100%) that JOMON didnt hook an S.
>sue: CKO 7H .OCK +24 42
#note missing ALFRESC(O)
>james: ACEFLRS K4 FLA. +22 36
#note missing ALFRESC(O) - also FLAC(K) scores 6 more!
>sue: ?AEHNOS 12B ENHAlOS +86 128
#note i didnt hold but should've.  i wasnt 100% that JOMON didnt take an S and didn't go through with holding/challenging. i quickly saw other bingo possibilites eg SENHORA and so didn't challenge
>james: CDEIRSW 10G C.WRIDES +68 104
#note i knew there was a bingo in CDEIORSW - i always see COWDRIES - reminds me of a former England cricket called COWDREY.  i looked for quite a while for other bingos as i wasn't sure of it and then went with this - the real bingo is CROWDIES.

>james: ADEISTU B7 AUDIT.ES +72 176
#note or c7 AUDIENTS for 2 more points.
>sue: BEITZ C3 ZIBET +37 191
#note BIZ at a13 scores more
>james: AAEETUY A13 YEA +25 201
#note 11d AYE for 29 sims a bit better
>sue: BDIR 2J BR.ID +28 219
>james: AEEHRTU D2 HATE +33 234
#note i was weighing up between my play and D1 HEAT which i ended up thinking was too agressive. I missed D1 HEATER which scores 47 and is best. 8k ETHER is also liked.

#note  with Sue's last play i thought she may have the ? given ?SSSS has been played already. If you don't assume the ? then 1e GUINEA for 25 sims best followed by L10 (D)UI. If you specify ? then my play sims top - was i right to be paranoid here? sue said she was trying to play tiles to get to the ?. I figured if she had it, then playing off 6 gave me a good shot to hit the X for the N6 spot.
>sue: EX N5 EX +52 380
>james: ?AORUVY E10 OV.RY +22 359
#note lowish on time - i make a poor decision. i now think i need to hit a bit Q play so play off VORY keeping AU? trying to get the Q.   quackle says 5c (BE)VY is best followed by YOU at e5 or l6 or AY at 11d.  This is an endgame fail on my part.
>sue: EOTV 15F VETO +29 409
>james: ?AIMOPU 1G PUMA +28 387
#note yuck. i couldnt see that i just set up Sue's Q for an even better play with this play.   L8 PO(D)IA for 33 is best.
>sue: IQR 2F QI +35 444
>james: ?IO 3G pOI +7 394
#note seconds left i just throw this down. best out play is L7 OxI(D)
