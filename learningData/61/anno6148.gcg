>Ryan_Fischer: AAIILNV 8D VINAL +24 24
#note I can't understand why VINAL is so far down below AVAIL.  Of course, with AVAIL you leave IN, so that might have something to do with it.  Hope of drawing a G and all.
>Brian_Galebach: AEHKM 7E MAKE +34 34
#note He showed HAK(I)M first; HAKE would do.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIJLOOO D8 .OILA +16 40
#note Sets up JO for 36.

>Ryan_Fischer: BJNOOPS 6F BO +28 68
#note Right idea; BOSON.  Eh, it's close.

#note Very seriously considered A12 F(o/e)OD fo defensive considerations.  But this opens a second spot, so it's got that going for it.

#note Worst case scenario if I play OWNED is if he bingos from the D.  With big tiles he pulls ahead.  I decided not to chance it.  Ditto for not playing TOURED.  Q has some fishes, but I figured I'd try to score a bit more in case he's able to play on row 14.
>Brian_Galebach: F 7M F.. +20 275

#note OTIOSE is just dumb.  I really like my play.
>Brian_Galebach: GV J3 G.V +20 295
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGIOPT C13 GET +22 371
#note It's GEE or GET.  What happens is probably the worst case scenario other than a bingo.
>Brian_Galebach: CEIRTX 15C .ECTRIX +51 346
#note Beautiful play.  I held for a very long time before I figured I could eke it out.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIIOP 14J OPE +11 382
#note Ugly rack.  At least I made the best evaluated play.
>Brian_Galebach: IY L13 Y. +5 351
#note It was very possible he'd be Y stuck, of all letters, if I had tracked right and had more time.
