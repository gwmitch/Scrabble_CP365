>JD: AEIIRTU -IU +0 0
#note the last time rafal and I had played also began with us exchanging a bunch of times. keeping AERT is probably a little better since quackle doesn't account for his increased probability of exchanging after I exchange to start.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: ?ACEGIS -?ACEGI +0 0
>JD: ADEEIRT -D +0 0
#note interesting position - I correctly recognized that AEEIRT bingos more than ADEIRT or ADEERT (thanks to EATERIE in CSW). however, if he puts a play on the board, the other two leaves immediately become stronger. I really thought he would exchange again, and I did see the prospect of a pass-out, which swayed me toward AEEIRT. probably should just keep ADEIRT.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: ELOOY 8H LOOEY +24 24
>JD: AEEIJRT 7G TAJ +38 38
#note a massive error compared to EEJIT at 7G which makes it harder for me to be hurt by a comeback on row 9 (and scores more).

>JD: AEIIMOR O8 MOAI +25 237
#note should likely just play MOIRAI. I didn't like the nice lane that it created at column N but there are already lots of lanes available.

#note thought about challenging
>JD: EEEFITT M3 TETE +18 376
#note Q prefers the increased bingo chances after FETE at O3, or TEF at M3. the C is not really a threat as a bingo line since I have the last I, so FETE looks good.
