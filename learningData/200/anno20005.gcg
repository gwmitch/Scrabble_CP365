#note Is this as simple as M being more valuable than the G in general?  IGG >  MIG
>Lloyd_Mills: FHO G5 FOH +24 24
>Matthew_Ridout: CIOOSST F7 OTIC +20 32
#note I took the points, but OS F5 sims best.  CIOST must be really good, not just good.

#note Simmed best
>Lloyd_Mills: DEEKRST 3D STRE.KED +69 108
>Matthew_Ridout: AAENNSU E3 .UNA +8 97
#note HELP!   How is GAUN 1H better than taking three more points for TUNA E3?  Same leave, and TUNA leaves a more open board, which I'd think I want when behind points and a turn.  I could understand defending row 1, but he just bingo'ed...

>Matthew_Ridout: ?AELNSX J1 AX. +26 123
#note I wonder if ?ENS is just better in general than ?ELNS, or if AXEL sims better because there are no L's on the board yet

>Matthew_Ridout: ?EEJLNS C1 J. +9 132
#note LENES > JO by a fraction.   Maybe this board isn't bingo-prone enough for the fish, maybe 18 is too many to give up.  Maybe both...
