#note I thought here for a LONG time. So much that each and every option that is listed here was considered. My play wins the sim after 1000 iterations.

#note F6 ZO(N)A or ZO(N)AE lead the slim by a slight margin over my play. I think they're all fine options, not really sure how I should approach choosing which one specifically. If anything, my play turns over an extra tile, but the J at 9C could burn me badly.
>Flora_Taylor: IN 6D .IN +14 131
>Joey_Krafchick: AMNOOSU 5J UNMOO. +16 184
#note 10B MASON wins sim slightly. C9 MUONS is 5 equity points back, but I think I might have played it if I saw it since it eliminates the J-bomb possibility at 9C. 1200 iterations, UNMOO(R) is (-2.5)

#note 6B AD(ZIN)G is best undoubtably, cute fit there. (-6.5)

#note Not setting up the E hook by playing GEST/GAZEBOS, sorry.

#note I need to bingo to win, considering that scoring opportunities on this board are limited. Worst case scenario is she bingoes, but I needed to take that gamble even with the other blank out. Equity wise, 10B YES is good but she's going to burn me with a comeback play pretty much in every scenario.

#note That happened, wow. I feel like I made a solid effort this game, DEI(S)T was a bit too sloppy, though.
