>Rafi_Stern: ACCORRV 8F CROC +16 16
#note Another good game against Rafi from 12-19-14, though not as interesting as the first one. Rafi played this quite quickly but upon reflection preferred VAC.
>Noah: FGHILUY J5 UGLIFY +34 34
>Rafi_Stern: AAEERUV F6 VA.UA +20 36
>Noah: AEHINPQ 5G PIQ.E +32 66
#note Maybe misevaluated scoring spots and should've done EQUIP. They're both good plays. This plays a bit better defensively if that's what I want.

>Noah: ?EGLMNO 12B cOM.NGLE +72 190
#note Missed MaNGONEL which seems a bit better. Also missed COMiNGLE I8 which i don't like. 
>Rafi_Stern: AIIKNTU 3H KAINIT +32 123
>Noah: IILNOST 14B TONSIL +30 220
#note There are a lot of other possibilities here, but I don't like  anything more than this, which intuitively feels extremely strong. It just seems like my winning percentage is pretty high and as long as I can keep scoring well and not allow Rafi to play too many bingos I can win it. This accomplishes that well. I also have LOTI 2J or TOIL/INTI on column L. I thought about LOTI because he thought for a while about KAINIT and might have the X -- several other tiles make sense with KAINIT though, and it makes sense for him to think a while with AIIKNTU, plus there are other strong X spots after LOTI. I would play this again but maybe I'm using strategic concepts wrongly.
>Rafi_Stern: AORSTUV L2 V.RTUOSA +91 214
>Noah: EIILOST M7 IOLITES +76 296
#note Seems to best reduce Rafi's bingo chances for this game, while keeping plenty of scoring potential on the board.
>Rafi_Stern: ADDMNOX 2I AX +52 266
#note Missed MOXA 15A.
>Noah: ?EEEHOR L12 HERE +28 324
#note I thought about not opening the 3x3 with something like 13C HEN but I thought giving him basically one chance to hit it was strong. HERO looks better though because with four Ds and lots of scoring tiles still out the E is a great way for Rafi to keep pace -- though he still likely needs a bingo to win.
>Rafi_Stern: BDDMNOU 15H DUMB.D +36 302
#note DUMB 1F is also possible, but the lane it opens isn't that great, DUMBED scores better and turns over more into a good pool, plus there are still comeback chances for Rafi (through the G, along column O, or just by scoring well).
>Noah: ?BDEEOT 15A BODE +32 356
#note Missed DEORBITEd, but the plays are close, and I think this is better. Rafi can still play on col N after DEORBITEd and fish for a triple triple or huge col O play, both of which I can't block. 
>Rafi_Stern: AEFNORY N10 FOY +41 343
>Noah: ?AEENTW O6 NEWEsT +32 388
#note First thing to note is that Rafi's rack is close enough to random since FOY is so many points, and DUMBED/AX don't imply a ton. If I don't block column O, I have to fish, but fishes allow many column O bingos from Rafi and often don't hit the G, while NEWEsT falls only to bingos through the G, so I can't fish. I can't outscore a bingo from Rafi with out a bingo of my own, so I didn't play rENEW. In a tournament, I might want to look into rENEW a little more because it could be better for spread. Finally, I can play a fish that blocks column O. (SO)WN is essentially the only option, and it misses way too often while opening a new bingo lane for Rafi. NEWEsT or similar is correct.
