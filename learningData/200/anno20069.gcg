#note too cautious, should just play off BB. quackle likes ABB - it thinks my bingos score more as a result.

#note WEM in the same spot also sims well. WEXE at N1 not an option given YOWE
>Bob_Linn: BEORY 11C OBEY +26 95
>JD: ?ILRTWX 12C XI +35 229
#note I'm in no hurry to bingo, should just play through all the consonants first and hold the X
>Bob_Linn: ANRV N2 VAN +17 112
>JD: ?JLLRTW -JLLW +0 229
#note lots of vowels left, I felt comfortable keeping RT?. But with 4 Ts left I should just keep R?. this is why I should've played WRIT - less likely to run into disaster scenarios
>Bob_Linn: DEO 13C ODE +34 146
>JD: ?BIPRTW 13G BIT +23 252
#note first I chickened out of RIPT# even though I had studied it just before the tournament. also didn't think of TWP at N9, which is a nice defensive move that permanently closes the right. but my play is not atrocious.
>Bob_Linn: ACEEFOT -ACE +0 146
>JD: ?JOPRUW -JOUW +0 252
#note after his exchange 3, he's presumably quite close to a bingo - rather than take 20 points, I wanted to have a rack that would be able to bingo in response to his bingos (no hurry for me to bingo first and open a triple-triple). but really I should just cash the 22 for JOUR, or OW for 12 to block the lanes isn't bad either - might as well take the free points and spread. also should probably keep OPR? to minimize variance
>Bob_Linn: AEINORS N8 ERASION +75 221
>JD: ?AINPPR O13 PAP +27 279
#note hmm, still no bingos for me. but definitely not a critical situation yet
>Bob_Linn: ELW B13 LEW +17 238
>JD: ?INNRRT 15A T.IN +24 303
#note a better opening than I realized at the time, because I did not know GLODE#...
>Bob_Linn: AJSW O5 JAWS +60 298
>JD: ?MNRRTV -MRRTV +0 303
#note oh man, now it's going to be a game. I saved the case N for QIN. quackle quite likes keeping MN?, presumably for the same spot.
>Bob_Linn: DEEG 14I EDGE +13 311
>JD: ?ACEINO 14E ACE +17 320
#note all of a sudden I was running out of time. fortunately I realized that I have a lane on column J with SUNI# that I can hit. the better play in this same spot is BIDON#/ONCE.
>Bob_Linn: AGLOOTU A7 AUTOLOG +84 395
>Bob_Linn: AGLOOTU --  -84 311
#note not gonna lie, I thought that neither of these were good...
>JD: ?AINORR 15K ORA +10 330
#note it would be great to play ROARING/GLODE# but I just didn't know it...I also didn't want to play RAN or ROAN at K2 knowing he had the G, since I didn't know GLODE was good I feared that AUTOLOG might be valid. I should just play OR instead of ORA.
>Bob_Linn: LO 15G LO +11 322
>JD: ?HINRRS H7 H... +9 339

#note nitrids for 2 more. phew.
