>JD: ACIO 8G CIAO +12 12
>Matthew_Pinner: AEGKQRY 7I KYE +31 31
#note with no immediate prospects for playing the Q, big premium on being as defensive as possible - so plays like GAK and GEY actually outsim KYE even though they score 10-12 points less

>Matthew_Pinner: AIINRRS 3C RI. +12 176
#note not a great move on my part. should probably just take the points for QINS
>JD: EMW F2 WEM +27 167
>Matthew_Pinner: AGINPRS N7 SPRA.ING +82 258
#note wow, nice draw. but I missed the PRECEDING hook which is dumb
>JD: EHT O6 THE +35 202
>Matthew_Pinner: EILOOUW 5J WOOLIE +25 283
>Matthew_Pinner: NRRSSUU (challenge) +5 288
#note should play the WOOLIE for more points. especially since I figured SPRAYINGS# might be good so the board is open anyway
>JD: FIR D2 F.R +22 224
>Matthew_Pinner: NRRSSUU O14 UR +9 297
#note I'm in a tough spot because I don't want him to try SPRAYINGS, but I also can't try it myself. really with both esses in hand I shouldn't be all that scared of that spot - maybe just OURN at 12H is reasonable enough.
>JD: DELV 8A DELV. +39 263
>Matthew_Pinner: ANNRSSU B6 UR.NA +9 306
#note an overreaction, should really just score some points - he can outrun me with scoring tiles now. AUXIN is nice.
>JD: ILLP M3 PI.L +12 275
>Matthew_Pinner: AIMNOSS 11E O..M +30 336
#note I should try to flip over more tiles in quest of the blank or Z. AMNIO at 4J does this nicely
>JD: BJ 4L J.B +46 321
>Matthew_Pinner: ?AINOSS A7 A.ONISeS +65 401
#note played over here to make sure I wouldn't lose to a miracle bingo.
