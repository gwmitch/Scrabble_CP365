>Jim_Burlant: ADORSUU 8H ARDUOUS +68 68
#note The first three tiles out of the bag were UOU and I thought to myself, "You've got to be kidding!"  Then the rack came together.  Wasn't sure what the right placement was...and it doesn't look like it's a big deal to the duck, either. 8B, 8G, 8H are at the top of the sim and they evaluate within 0.4 points of each other.
>Paul_Holser: CDEIJ K7 J.ICED +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: ILOOOST L12 OLIO +16 84
#note Not thrilled about slotting the 3x3 for only 16 points but didn't feel I had much choice.  L11 LOO scores 14 but gives back so many huge plays for a not-so great leave.  If I have to give back points no matter what, I might as well leave myself the best possible rack combination.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Paul_Holser: AEOT M10 TOEA +16 48
>Jim_Burlant: IIIOSTY 10K .I.Y +17 101
#note A close call between this and exchanging.  I felt that uas long as I could score 17 points while unloading one of my triplicated I's was just enough that I couldn't justify throwing in.  Q agrees with me - this is best, just barely.  Exchanging IIOY is also a strong choice.  
>Paul_Holser: DEHOT 15J HO.TED +30 78
>Jim_Burlant: IINOSTT I5 INT.OITS +60 161
#note Thank goodness the bingoes played.  I saw this and didn't look further.  OSTINATI H3 scores 59 (this scores 60) and looks to be a smidgen better, as it doesn't give up easy plays from H1 or to H15.  Still in the driver's seat, though at just shy of 80% to win.
>Paul_Holser: AI 14N AI +11 89
>Jim_Burlant: CHPQSWW 5G WH.PS +26 187
#note Yikes!  CHIPS in the same spot prevents bingoes in the northwest.  But, besides unloading one of the duplicated W's (!!), this gives me potential 5's ending in CH on the next turn.  While I'd normally like to keep the S, I have to play it here to clear as much of this garbage as I can.  Making that decision easier is that there are no really good S hooks on the board.  Q agrees with me - this is best, and it's 84% to win.
>Paul_Holser: ?AAEINR 12B ANERgIA. +66 155
#note Seemingly a minor slip, but cARINAE for 75 on row 3 would have prevented my next play and left me a set of routine opitions instead of the huge play I wound up having:
>Jim_Burlant: CNQRTUW B10 QU.NT +68 255
#note Not often I'm happy to see an opponent bingo, but I was quite relieved to see him float the A.  While this or QUART are clearly best, there was one interesting choice I never even noticed: CRWTH H1 leaving NQU.
>Paul_Holser: AIMR 15A RAMI +36 191
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEPRWX H1 PERC. +45 300
#note Saw this and put it down on auto-pilot.  It's either this or APEX H12.  Still in the driver's seat at just shy of 99% to win.
>Paul_Holser: DEEGNNR 2H .NGENDER +78 269
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEEWX E8 WAXE. +30 330
#note BEEsWAX doesn't play, and I was going to play  rEWAXES N2 prior to his bingo. I was still fixated on playing off the W and the X...so much so that I missed the obvious play.  The correct play here is O1 BREW.  This is total idiocy.  Nothing like coughing up 19 equity on what should have been a routine play that a kitchen player should find.  Fortunately for me, this is the only major  mistake I make during the relevant portion of the game.
>Paul_Holser: OY 1N YO +26 295
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEFGUV 13A E.UF +23 353
#note No clue what to do with this, so I figured I'd score, eliminate 7's on row 14 and hope for some of those unseen E's.  Granted, row 14 isn't the biggest threat, but it's still a threat.  Q likes  N5 GUVS/VUGS best.  I sort of see that...but those plays don't really defend and they definitely don't score.  And the BEF? leave with VUGS/GUVS isn't so good that I'd give up 13 scoreboard points for it.  As Jeff Reeves said...if in doubt, take the points.
>Paul_Holser: ELM 7M MEL +17 312
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEGSVV 9D V.V +9 362
#note Not an easy position.  Considered VIVE G11 but didn't want to burn my E.  This was entirely for defensive purposes, as it kills easy plays like AGLOW 8A and makes it much tougher for him to bingo down the D column.  Q is conflicted about this, as the sim and championship player are in total disagreement with each other.  The sim says this is my best play, and exchanging BGVV is a very close second.  Championship Player says I should exchange 4 keeping ES?.  
>Paul_Holser: ANO D7 NO.A +23 335
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEGGRS N1 ..GG +9 371
#note Considered BEGGaR down the C column burning the blank but it didn't feel right.  I put this down to block FAZES and take the bag down to 1.  Q agrees - this is best.

>Paul_Holser: ILZ 4L ZI. +26 384
>Jim_Burlant: ?BER H10 BE.Rs +12 401
#note Using the previous turn to leave myself BER? was the right idea...and this was the wrong execution.  BReVE scores 34 at F6.  Saw it but wasn't 100% sure of it so I took the 100% guaranteed play.  Whoops.
