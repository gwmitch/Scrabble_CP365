#note Quackle sligtly prefers FLI(N)DERS at J4 for 3 more points. FIELD(E)RS at 12G also possible.

I did not know FLIR was a word.

#note WHEELY# is CSW-only and this was a TWL game. My bad.

>Zach: MNOU -  +0 267
#note Zach challenged TANTRAS and lost.
>Jennifer: DIJKRTU C3 JUR.T +26 277
#note Quackle slightly prefes JI(L)T at 14F, leaving DKRU. I liked JUR(A)T at C3 better to burn the U. Now I think JI(L)T probably is better, as it's a more defensive play and doesn't give back like JUR(A)T. On the other hand, though, I'm behind going into this turn.
>Zach: BBMNOTU D1 MUON +31 298
>Jennifer: BDDGIKV 11C V.D +14 291
#note Quackle wants me to exchange here, which I did consider. 25 tiles left in the bag. Preferred exchange is BDGIKV, leaving D.
>Zach: AALMO 1A ALA.O +21 319
>Jennifer: BDEGIKO 14M K.G +17 308
#note BI(L)KED for 37 at 14F is much better. Also BO(V)ID at C9 for 42 points. Sigh. 

>Zach: ACGOR B10 CARGO +36 355
>Jennifer: BDEEIOT 14F BO.TED +33 341
#note I missed OBEDIE(N)T here at J1, instead seeing the spot where I should have played BI(L)KED last turn.
>Zach: AEP A11 PEA +23 378
>Jennifer: ?EIMOPU B4 MO.E +15 356
#note I missed PrOMI(SER) and EsPOU(SER) from H1.
