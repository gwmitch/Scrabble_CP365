#note H7 CANNONADE is just beautiful. I liked this severe reduction in his bingoing chances
>Deen_Hergott: CIST H11 CIT.S +24 136
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIIKPT 15A KITHE +50 209
#note I was in a fantastic position after this play. Deen almost always gets into time trouble, especially on tough boards, so the game was basically won for me at this point.

>Joshua_Sokol: GILLNPU O1 GULPIN +38 247
>Joshua_Sokol: GILLNPU --  -38 209
#note Could this be a choking point? I am still in great shape even if this is phony. GULPIN is a Pokémon... Damn you Pokémon!
>Deen_Hergott: EHISV O11 SHIVE +47 199
#note I have much more time than Deen and I still have more than tempo on him.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEIJLNR A12 JER. +23 254
#note My only worry was a quick and easy X play at 14B, so there goes that way out for Deen. But there is still O8 actually. Am I losing it?
>Deen_Hergott: EM O8 EM +22 244
#note another evasion. Seems the only thing between me and victory is using up too much time, choking or both, now.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEILNNU -NUNDILE +0 254
#note Pretty sure this was my rack. This seemed like a perfect opportunity to exchange all 7. I would theoretically have perfect knowledge of what Deen had for a small while, and then I would know what was possible to draw. He was running out of time, I had a large time advantage, and therefore the less tiles I play, the longer the game will last. 

On the other hand, I really don't know how to compare this exchange with some of the plays I could have made, since they all scored little to nothing. Except N(O)D F13 and ELD M9. The game is close, so if I score 23 or 18 it's a very good thing. Unfortunately the X is still pretty good, all other things considered, and it might make a difference depending on who draws it. He just played EM, and so he only has a 2/9 chance of having drawn the X. And do I lose if he has it? Who knows, time is scarce and we are both likely going to make mistakes in this endgame. I just tried to make as few as possible by giving myself as much knowledge as I could of what was on his rack and in the bag. 
>Deen_Hergott: DEGRSST 10B .....S +22 266
#note this is what my tracking said he had. Unfortunately, for the rest of the game, my handwriting and tracking seem to lead me to believe certain things I don't know are true. Anyways, I thought I was in the drivers seat, having drawn the X and the case A's.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAPRWX C9 P.X +24 278
#note I don't know what my last tile was. I would have liked to be able to have more detailed commentary of this "endgame".
>Deen_Hergott: DES 14M DE. +17 283
>Joshua_Sokol: AARW 15A .....R +15 293
#note And here is a major choking point. I kind of knew KITHER* was invalid. Luckily Deen choked himself here by not challenging.
>Deen_Hergott: ERS 11H .ER.S +17 300
#note On the other hand, challenging this would have been really bad. I had the game in the bag at this point. No need to take enormous risks. Especially since I had no idea and CERUSITE is valid.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAELNNW G12 LA. +8 301
#note Here are two interesting things. I have him tracked with GNTUU at this point.
I am still underscored by 4. I am using up all my time at this point, seeing if he can do anything about the J2 spot. it seems he can't, without giving me something big. Looks like I should therefore wait to cash the spot. But I mistracked... Also, WAN will always be right at J1. GINTU and GNTUU racks can do nothing about WAN.
>Deen_Hergott: GINTU F9 ..G +7 307
#note Still losing.
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNW 13C E. +4 305
#note still WAN. Still winning. Deciding to block U(T).
>Deen_Hergott: INTU 12D .I +2 309
#note he has an I? Hopefully he still has what I think he has, NTU.
>Joshua_Sokol: ANNW 5J N.. +5 310
#note Zugzwang
>Deen_Hergott: NTU 3H UNT. +5 314
#note oops
