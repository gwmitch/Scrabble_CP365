#note every change to play nigel is a special one. unfortunately this time I didn't bring my A game. quackle has TROCHI# simming much better, but presumably nigel will never play TROCHIL and let me get the snapback unless he has no choice.

#note here it is - the lowest point of my scrabble career to date. with a golden chance to triple-triple on nigel, I spent 10 minutes looking, didn't see either of my (quite common) bingos, and ran out of time and lost the game. thank goodness it didn't happen in a more important tournament.
>Nigel_Richards: DOQU 2F QU.D +34 331
#note uNBeATEN. BANNerET. when I realized after the game what I had missed, I stormed off for about an hour, barely returning in time for my next game.

>JD: AIIMOSU L11 MOI.A +16 341
#note I was out of time and ideas. I thought of MAURI afterwards. my winning chances are only 15%. quackle likes just taking the points with OUMA at 14A, which makes sense.

>JD: EEILOSU A7 ELUSI.E +30 371
#note I probably must play something fishier than this to have a hope of winning, I just liked being able to open the good lane on column B. actually, URE/NIXE looks like a really nice play that creates a lane on column B. no time to find it.
>Nigel_Richards: ATW F6 WA. +30 439
>JD: GIOOPRT C5 POO. +27 398
#note as a last insult to injury, I threw in the towel and didn't find my 1/36 (although I might have already been over on time). EGO/UG/GO threatens both TROPARIA and ATROPIA unblockable, leading to a 2 point win. also I didn't know POORT#.

#note I went over on time by two minutes.
>Nigel_Richards: DOOS I4 ODSO +23 491
#note it definitely took a lot of effort to recover from missing the 3x3. I was still steaming during the next round - sorry Steve. if I ever need motivation to study and work on anagramming, this will always be it!
