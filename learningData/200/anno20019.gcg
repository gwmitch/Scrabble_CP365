#note I didn't think hard and long about this, pretty much slapping it down on autopilot.  It actually takes the sim a few hundred iterations for this to percolate to the top.  Q says EVICT in the same location is practically just as good, as it sims barely 1-1/2 points down and wins only 0.6% less often.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEJLMS 6I AJEE +29 55
#note Not at all happy about having to give up both my E's, but he just blocked my impending JEE G7, so I have no choice.  This is best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EGLMSS --  -90 55
#note I genuinely thought this was good and was not trying to pull a fast one; I didn't see GLIMpSES, either.
>Darrell_Day: HI 4L HI +24 50
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGLMSS E6 GL.MES +18 73
#note As I said, I never saw GLImPSES (the only E column bingo).  At this point I saw GuMLESS, but was less than 50% sure of it, and I wasn't about to risk playing for 0 points on consecutive turns. I put this down just to open up the southwest and unload the N-less G and one of my S's.  GLIMPSES is best, and the sim says I4 GLANS for 17 is best if I whiff on the bingoes.
>Darrell_Day: EFI F10 FIE +29 79
>Jim_Burlant: ?MORSTV G7 ..V +11 84
#note At this point I'm coming dangerously close to unraveling.   as I'm beating myself up for the phony and cursing myself for not knowing enough words.  Adding insult to injury I think I'm playing poorly when I'm just dumping off the V for nothing instead of looking to score.  The pleasant surprise upon running a sim is that this is actually my best play and that 3I MORTS wins 1% less often and sims nearly 7 points down.
>Darrell_Day: QU M2 QU.. +26 105
>Jim_Burlant: ?AMORST N4 STARdOM +76 160
#note The best play here is sick:  c(RE)MATORS K4, which scores 75 and doesn't play with fire in terms of board position.  This is my highest scoring bingo, but like I said, c(RE)MATORS is better.  66% to win.  Of note:  (RE)fORMATS K5 for 70.
>Darrell_Day: AIW 8L WA.I +30 135
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEINO N1 BI +30 190
#note Q likes this best, but I wonder if I should have played OI for 4 fewer points; the absolute worst case with OI is that it gives back a 27-point OX where this could give back slightly higer scoring plays with one-point tiles.  Regardless, 71% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AB 7M B.A +17 152
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEENO M7 ..DE +18 208
#note Considered two plays:  this and WOADED L8.  WOADED scored 4 more but I rejected it; rightly or wrongly, I thought it could start a chain reaction eventually leading to an opening I couldn't block.  I was also more concerned about reducing his ability to score at O15.  This reduced his ability to play to O15 from anything starting in A, E, I, O, and U, to E, U, and S.  This isn't airtight, but it's a start.
>Darrell_Day: IS O1 IS +30 182
>Jim_Burlant: ADELLNO O6 N..LED +18 226
#note Not worried about rack building since the board isn't especially bingo prone and anything he does put down (if  he can hit) will give me H15 plays back.  The sim says it's either this or F2 LLANO, and that this is the runner up by the slimmest of margins.  LLANO wins 67.2%, this wins 67 and actually sims 0.1 points better.
>Darrell_Day: RU D8 .UR +15 197
>Jim_Burlant: ACEELOP 10C P...ACE +22 248
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  I should keep the P both for rack balance and to give myself an easy 10C play on the next turn. I saw this, saw 22 points (easily my highest scoring option) and 4 tiles turned (the blank is still unseen), and that was that.   Nonetheless, this is just shy of 71% to win. REFACE wins 1-1/2% more often and sims 2-1/2 points better.  
>Darrell_Day: HNRY I9 H.NRY +19 216
>Jim_Burlant: ELLNOOT 12H T.OLL +12 260
#note With no A for ATENOLOL, nothing really scores here; my highest scoring plays all score 14 points and this scores 12.  Best is apparently 12I ROOTLE, presumably for turnover to go after the blank and to clear out both O's, since 5 are still unseen and O is my most probable draw. Q also likes F3 NOLO, but that opens up way too much for my tastes.  Looking at the pool, this is a minor mistake but not a major blunder.
>Darrell_Day: DIK J8 KID +37 253
>Jim_Burlant: EINORRZ C10 .REZ +30 290
#note Erring on the side of caution.  I saw and rejected J12 OOZE  (no thanks, not floating an E in the triple with the blank unseen), C10 PRIZE (don't want to give up the various row 15 hooks with the blank out) and 6B ZING (don't like keeping duplicated R's even if none are left as well as opening up the B column) before settling on this.  This puts me up 37 on a dead board, and if he does score, he has to open up for me.  This is the 4th place finisher in the sim,but for me this was the best play I could have made this game as you'll soon see:

#note Wasn't sure what the best sequence was, and seeing that I was about to go back up to 2-2 with virtually no spread to speak of(the tourney was only 6 games long and I was already 2 games out of first), it didn't seem worthwhile to figure it out.  Best is apparently L12 LUAU.
