>JD: AEFORRY L9 ORFRAY +39 275
#note I didn't like FORAY because it temporarily sets up a massive 2x2. ORFRAY seemed to allow me to control the board more in future turns because it takes up a lot of room. quackle likes AFORE which is probably right.

>JD: AEIIOSX 6H .IXIE +28 303
#note good board shape for me now. although he did block COAXES. quackle wants me to play IXORA which is probably best even with the 100-point lead. NIXIE looks defensive but IXORA also blocks a lot.

#note I thought my play was dumb, but quackle in fact quite likes it for the good defense. still hard to see how he will bingo and outrun me
