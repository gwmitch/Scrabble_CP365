#note waseem was kind enough to share many of his racks with me. thank you waseem! he exchanged 6 here to keep an E.
>JD: ?ACEEEV 8E CAVE +18 18
#note I whiffed on my only bingo here, kinda tricky but normally within my range - EVACUEE. perhaps I was still a bit put off by the nigel game. with the blank in hand I played CAVE at 8E to open the 2x2 lane, but in the process I lower my bingo percentage due to the potential for unbalanced vowel-heavy draws. in short, play the bingo.

#note lucky to complete
>Waseem_Khatri: EOQRZ J4 ROQ.E +34 46
#note he actually had the Z on this turn and could've played ZERO for 50, but giving back a lot of points in the process. in a sim with no further information of his rack, ZERO and ROQUE are quite even.
>JD: DDIORSU 12D DRUID +28 132
>Waseem_Khatri: ADEIIOZ H11 A.OZE +45 91
#note did he miss iodize?
>JD: DIOOSTU 6J .UOIT +16 148
#note getting a little cute with setting up the S. should probably just take the points for OUTDO at D1.

>Waseem_Khatri: AACMNPT D1 CAMP +34 165
>JD: EEEIOST 1D .OESITE +27 220
#note the good S hooks on the board evaporated, so it seemed reasonable to spend the case S to score more points.
>Waseem_Khatri: ?ALNOOT C2 TOOLmAN +79 244
>JD: ABDELTX 2H TAXED +58 278
#note not good to spend one of the last Es here - should really just play TAX. Actually quackle even likes kist playing OX at 5J which bingos 2/3 of the time next turn!
>Waseem_Khatri: FLW L4 FL.W +20 264
>JD: ABEHLMY 1L ABLY +34 312
#note I really liked saving HEM for column B next turn, where a draw of a consonant usually gives me a 40 point play (and drawing vowels means that waseem doesn't have them, which is also good). the sim is very close between ABLY and YLEM at B3 or HAULM at F10 setting up HAULMY.
>Waseem_Khatri: ANV 3G VAN +18 282
>JD: EHIIMPT B2 IMP +35 347
#note right after I hit my clock I realized that I had missed MEATH, but again it's not a big loss because my EHIT leave scores very well next turn, whereas IIP does not.

#note I have to block JAK but I missed the best way, which is to play FURR#. I'm not even sure I knew that was a word.
>Waseem_Khatri: ABJK G11 J.B +31 383
#note he should play JIB at 13A to set up JAK unblockable.
>JD: LRUW 11G ..W +13 458
#note missed JARUL.
