#note As usual, I'm unsure what to keep on an exchange like this. Sim likes ADLN by a bit over everything else.

#note I think this play is fine. I can try to play more defensively (PIU) but I can't really see a reason to.

#note Jackson overdrew, and I put back the R from his LOR.

#note Very interesting choice. I thought mostly about ZEES L1, AZO J1, ADOZE 3J, AZON L1, and ZA J2. ZONAE/ZOEAE 9C may also be worth considering. I didn't like ZEES mostly because if he plays through the Z I have very little to do...and he likely has mediocre-decent low point tiles given his plays. AZON I didn't see much of a reason to play -- allows him to score well and doesn't keep such a great leave. ZOEAE and ZONAE probably give him too much to play through after his previous plays, while scoring the same as ADOZE and not keeping as well. ZA is not bad given his past plays, though EENOS is not so great. AZO is a pretty good choice as well, though again gives him more to play through. This certainly does that too with row 2 and column N, but overall my intuition was that my position after ADOZE was better, even though I can't quite explain why.

>Noah: ACDIITT D3 DICTAT. +22 256
#note I don't think this play makes too much sense. T(E)IID seems like a better choice. This blocks row 2, but row 2 is actually not that great of a bingo lane (a bit hard to hit and gives back good scoring plays often), and DICTATE opens a lot of bigger bingo lanes, which can eventually be closed off, but there are also lanes at the bottom.

#note Autopiloted this because I wanted to conserve time, and shouldn't have. JA(C)K seems like a much better play.
>Jackson_Smylie: EEHPRST J2 P. +10 231
#note Jackson missed H(EDGER) here with this rack.
>Noah: ?CIKNNV F2 V.IN +15 312
#note I should maybe do VENIN, which I didn't spot. Scoring the extra 3 is pretty great. VEIN gives me a better chance at lEDGER plays, but I think VENIN just also keeps a rack that is more likely to be flexible because I play off a consonant, and still hit plenty of column B plays.

>Noah: ?CFKNTU E9 .oCKNUT +24 336
#note Thought about playing FlUNK, but it definitely loses to a few things (EGESTION, GAIETIES). KNOT does the same if I draw badly enough. It didn't seem like this would lose even if I draw 5 consonants (it doesn't). It is a big spread hit though, so I might be better off just doing FlUNK and hoping to avoid that 1-2% chance he bingos for some spread. Hard to say.
