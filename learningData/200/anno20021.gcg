#note The word I needed to find here was KORUNY (didn't know it).  If you don't know that, this is best.  However - the lack of turnover here did me in, as it didn't take long for me to find myself in situations where I just couldn't clean out the racks effectively.

>Jim_Burlant: DKNOPRS 7B KOP +22 36
#note Couldn't remember if KNOP was good (KNAP is good, wasn't sure about KNOP).  Given the limitations of the position, this is reasonable, but I definitely need to play KNOP here for the extra turnover.  From this point on, the game dissolved into a one-sided farce.  Hint:  I was on the short side of it.

#note No clue.  Hard for me to want to keep MSZ and play off all my bingo prone tiles, but that's what I should have done.  This was just asking for rack trouble.

#note Now I know why I have no vowels - Paul's drowning in them.

#note Ugh.  So fixated on the bingo I forgot the part about trying to score points.  K10 MEDS scores 41 and is best.  While best play wins 22% here, my failure to play at K10 here turned this game into a laugher.
>Paul_Holser: ?DHIILY K4 DIsHILY +81 222
#note Paul put this down very quickly and I almost never win challenges against him.  Shame on me for letting this stick!
>Jim_Burlant: ADEJNRS L1 JADE +46 130
#note Finally, after I was turning tiles, the rack started coming together...and the 7th tile was the J. Ugh.  At least I finally got a play right. 6% to win.
>Paul_Holser: GNV 2K V.NG +16 238
>Jim_Burlant: EFINORS L7 OF +23 153
#note Wow, 2 plays in a row that I got right!  No 8's available, I just wanted to set up an easy hook for my S while preserving the rack.  Up to 9% to win.
>Paul_Holser: BI 8A BI +20 258
>Jim_Burlant: EEINNRS D11 NE +10 163
#note Bwah hah hah!  All I saw was ENGINEERS as a 9.  I never saw SNEERING.  That said, SNEERING barely wins 12%.
>Paul_Holser: AG 14F GA. +19 277
>Jim_Burlant: EINRRSS 5J R.SEN +18 181
#note Just completely frazzled because of all the duplicatin in the racks, rather than recognizing that I've actually got anything.  Yes, I saw RINSERS...never recognized where to play it.  Board vision failure.  The consolation:  if I'd found it, he'd have bingoed for 83 down the O column.

#note Annotation ends, final score 451 - 307.  Amazing I hit 300.  Who was that pod person that took over my body and played this game for me?  Sheesh.
