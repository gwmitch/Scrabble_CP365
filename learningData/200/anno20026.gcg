>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFGIMU H7 FUG +14 14
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DIOOOOR -DIOOOO +0 0
#note Mark's racks are provided. Difficult to decide what to exchange here. DOR is actually a good leave here. But keeping R looks as good as anything.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGIIMT 9G I.G +8 22
#note Bigtime miss here.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DEEILRU 7H .LUE +8 8
#note H7 FUGU looks really nice here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIMTT F8 IMITaTE +70 92
#note so two words I actually didn't know appear here. MIMETITE and MITIEST. Those are both better than my choice. So is F6 TITMIcE, certainly. Missed that one.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DEIORSW 15F DOWRIES +96 104
#note DOWERIES is 98 but this is better given what it takes out.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADDIKZ 8A ZAIKA. +72 164
#note This tournament will always be remembered as having been sponsored by the business community of Japan.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AANOOQV J5 AQ.A +33 137
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDILOP L3 DIPODAL +83 247
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDILOP --  -83 164
#note I'm stupid.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: DNNOORV 12C NOV. +12 149
#note But he also challenged FLUED, which I know is good, so maybe I'll get a free turn later on...
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDILOP K5 DI.D +32 196
#note But I was keen on playing D(I)PLOID... This is good too, but so is E10 PA(V)ID. I liked the superior control DI(E)D bestowed upon me. But I missed PA(V)ID so I have no further comments.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: CDILNOR D4 CLIN. +22 171
#note missing IRONCL(A)D and DORNIC(K). Not sure he knew DORNIC(K). Not sure he knew CLON(K) either.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOPST 14J POETS +40 236
#note took a while here, naturally. Nothing plays. Good. I can afford to give him a mediocre and high-risk lane now I think. No use in keeping my S and sacrificing a lot of points and increasing the risk of an easy-to-grab spot hurting me dearly.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ACDEJOR 13K JOE +37 208
>Joshua_Sokol: AELLNNO 11F .OLANE +12 248
#note Nothing looks good here. I decided to take the opportunity to dig deeper in the bag and block another lane or two. (Z)ONAL is the safer play for my rack's sake, but I think I prefer this slightly, especially since ZONAL gives off the false impression of having blocked the A at B8.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ACDRRRW 12L DRAW +37 245
#note Mark is having very clunky draws this game.
>Joshua_Sokol: BBELNUY 5B BU.BY +24 272
#note Damn you Pokémon for encouraging me to phony again! At least this was not challenged.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: CEHMORR L1 CHEMO +34 279
#note wow, he's in the lead now.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFLNOXY M2 OXY +56 328
#note what a great draw for the scenario.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AEORRRS O8 ARRO. +24 303
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFHLNR 13B FEH +27 355
#note 9A ARF and B5 (B)EH(A)LF look better than this for sure. The L I have is really useless. I missed both better options...
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EEINRST 14A NET +19 322
#note ENURETI(C) and NEoTERI(C)/fRENETI(C) are the only things Mark can draw into, but playing CHEMOS/QIS scores well enough and freaks me out well enough that he may be able to win without bingoing.

Here is a list of what can be played through the letters on column B with the current pool. LI(B)ER(A)TES or LI(B)ER(A)TED, TA(B)UL(A)TES, INE(B)RI(A)TE or INE(B)RI(A)NT, TRI(B)UN(A)TE, its anagram TUR(B)IN(A)TE, TRI(B)UL(A)TE, SI(B)IL(A)NTS, PLE(B)EI(A)NS, TRI(B)UN(A)LS and TUR(B)IN(A)LS.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGLNPR 9A AG +17 372
#note counter setup for my PE. Kind of too cute. Looks like I should play 10J ANGLE(R) It also seems that Mark is holding quite well, so there is no way I am playing through the HO.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EEINRST 15A EN +18 340
#note this seems like the best play by all means. Good one by Mark.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNPRU 2K R.. +6 378
#note It will be very hard for Mark to outrun me, so I prefer to block all bingos quickly (he is also low on time) and outplay him in the preendgame and endgame. Blanks are really tough in these scenarios.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EIRSSTT 10A SET +23 363
#note Championship player cannot find any possible wins for Mark here in this pre-endgame. Can you?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AELNPU N6 PUNA +16 394
#note And wow, what a surprise to draw that other blank...

My time was running out and I almost threw away the game here, as I do, by playing EUP(RHO)E* and coming very close to hitting my clock. What a shock it was when I realized what I was about to do.

This was a botched endgame. I should have just nickel and dimed him.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: IIRSTV J5 ....S +23 386
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EL M8 aLE +9 403
>Joshua_Sokol:  (IIRTV) +16 419
#note Mark went over by a minute, and he said he hadn't done that in a very long time.
