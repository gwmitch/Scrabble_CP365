>Genius: AEINRST 8G NASTIER +66 66
#note I'd been drawing fairly well all tournament.  Looked like this game might go the same way.
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: EEGIIOV M8 .EGIVE +22 22
>Genius: ?EEIPRS 10F SPEERIn. +64 130
#note I felt the more defensive value of SPEERING offset the point loss.   Quackle disagrees, but I disagree with Quackle. 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: EIIJMOW 12K JI.E +28 50
#note RGP tries to give himself a comeback play...
>Genius: DHIOORZ O8 ZOOID +69 199
#note And I pounce on it.  I almost didn't see this.  I thought it was a lousy time to be without an E, but phew!
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: IIMNORW 14K WINO +25 75
#note This is a great play on RGP's part.  I'm not sure why, but Quackle definitely agrees. 
>Genius: AAEHNRT 9I HA +22 221
#note A superior leave.   I missed ETHANE, but keeping AENRT leaves a ton of possibilities for the next turn. 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: AAIIIMR 13I RIA +17 92
#note I could see RGP struggling with this rack. 
>Genius: ABENORT 7B BARONET +66 287
#note Spotted this one immediately! 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: AAAAIIM -AAAII +0 92
>Genius: ?ABEERS 15E BEArERS +88 375
#note A luckbox bingo.  The tiles have definitely been good to me.
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: AEFMMVY 8A MAMEY +55 147
#note Nice play! Looks like I can't call this a game quite yet!
>Genius: DEFKNOP 6E FOP +28 403
#note One of my lower scoring plays of the game.   I like how it closes the board, yet leaves it open.  RGP could miss the O hook leaving it all for ME, ME, ME!
#Luckily I haven't had any Us yet.
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: CEFOTUV F12 COV. +17 164
#note And he misses the hook!
>Genius: ADEKNSX 9C AX +26 429
#note Not the X bomb I wanted, but I'll take it. 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: AEFLQTU 15A QUAT....... +66 230
#note I held for a second, but I was pretty sure I'd seen this somewhere before.   You can't win them all!  Great bait. 
>Genius: DEKNSTU -DKNUT +0 429
#note I'm going after the O!  
#According to Q, I missed KETONURIA at 13C, But DUCK 12D was the better play. 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: EFLUUUY -UUY +0 230
#note Another exchange after that great play.
>Genius: DEIORSW 5F DOWRIES +82 511
#note My gamble pays off!
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: DDFILUY 4K FUDDY +43 273
>Genius: ACHILNT B7 ..TCH +28 539
#note No really sure what to do here.  I had plenty of time to think and this was my choice.  I liked hooking to AX and it kept a great versatile leave. 
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: LLNNTUU O1 LUN. +21 294
#note Rough break for RGP.  
>Genius: AEGGILN M2 GE. +10 549
#note I accidentally emptied the bag here, but I wasn't too concerned.  Still no U!
>ReallyGoodPlayerThatGeniusBeats: KLNOTTU 11A T.UNK +24 318
>Genius: AGILLN 2G GALLIN. +11 560
#note Whew, what a game!  Well played on both sides, although I almost feel guilty about winning like this.  
>Genius:  (LOT) +6 566
