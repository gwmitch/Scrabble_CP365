#note Dunno his rack, but I prefer KYE 15A
>Phil: AEELNNU N8 LUN. +12 267
#note I wanted to keep the board shut with the lead, so no UNLAY/LUNA/ULNAE in the upper right corner.

#note Nice fit
>Phil: ?DEEINO F9 .E +11 306
#note Q likes adding the N for NAE. I don't see the difference
>Dan_Wachtell: AFIRTTY L4 T..F +20 311
>Phil: ?DEINOV M3 DO. +24 330
#note Q likes opening the board with DONUT I4 or dumping the V with VODUN 9K. I'm torn b/w VODUN and DOC, which scores the most by far.
>Dan_Wachtell: AEILRTY 13H RYA +29 340
#note Another nice fit
>Phil: ?EHINTV 10A I.H +8 338
#note After much calculation I decided that my only chance to win was with ICH. First of all, does anyone see the awesome winning play? Hint- it gets rid of the V on this turn! Ok, so I thought that neither of us had time on our clocks, so hopefully he would mess up and not play the right thing, giving me a V play that blocks his outs.
>Dan_Wachtell: EILNRS 12A N. +3 343
#note This is completely beyond me. SMOCK/SAX wins for sure.
