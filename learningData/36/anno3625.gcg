#note On my scoresheet I have written TETANIC? and TETANOID? (TETANOID is good, but cannot be played).  I would have played TETANIC, however I missed the META hook.  This is pretty unforgiveable, but I think the combination of my losing my job the previous day, and my bad loss to Jane and George in the previous two games was a toxic combination for me psychologically.  Other bingos missed: NICTATE, TONETIC (didn't know), CITTERN, EXTINCT

#note TOADIES, TOADIED are correct.  This one is phony.  Did not know GODETIA was good (it's new to twl06).
>Ted_Bryde: EOV 15A VOE +25 73
>Adam_Henderson: ?ADEIOT 11H TOADIEr +70 118
#note TOADIES, TOADIED were correct.  Best (imo) is GODETIA, hooking CENTO, because it might draw a challenge.  GODETIA is new to the TWL06.
