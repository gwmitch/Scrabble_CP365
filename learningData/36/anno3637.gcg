>Jeff_Clark: AENNRTU H8 UN +4 4
>Jason: AEEILSS G9 AE +6 6
#note After cursing the lack of an R or D (B would've worked, too, but I didn't know the word), I proceeded to make a lousy play. Ducky says to fish off the E by itself. (-10.2)
>Jeff_Clark: AAEENRT F10 AE +8 12
#note Witnessing this opening sequence before his game began, Dan Stock said to his opponent: "These two really should play a word longer than two letters." Ducky doesn't see much wrong with either of Jeff's plays.
>Jason: AEILSST E4 SALTIES +67 73
#note Ducky likes the placement, but Ducky's also assuming perfect information. That assumption, as you'll later see, is faulty.
>Jeff_Clark: AEINRTX D7 AX +36 48
>Jason: ADEIMQS D1 QADI +52 125
>Jeff_Clark: ADEINRT I7 ANTIRED +68 116
#note (U)RINATED looks best. Jeff said I could lay an Alex Fiszbein/Terry Kang Rau-esque "nice find" on him, but the person who just played SALTIES doesn't have much room to talk. :)
>Jason: EMOSUWW H12 MEOW +46 171
#note I've never been so pleased to have the first three I look at be UWW. "I wasn't supposed to bait you from the Q *that* hard!" Jeff said. Duck likes WOWS, which I considered, but I'm an S-hog. WOW is also an interesting gambit and comes in second, this third. (-8.6)
>Jeff_Clark: EGNORRT 11C ROT. +24 140
#note OK, a good thing I didn't play WOWS. (Like I said, my mistakes are working out handsomely as of late.) If Jeff had known I'd blanked on the -T hook to SALTIES, he's have played Q's slight favorite of OR(A)NG at 2B, most likely.
>Jason: EJOPSUW 12B JEW +38 209
#note Missing JOW(L), 6B. Definitely played this turn too fast. (-13.7)
>Jeff_Clark: AEGNORY 13C GEY +28 168
#note Jeff gives me his racks on a separate sheet after our games. He wrote "ORANGEY?" on the sheet next to this rack but didn't play it. It's good. ORANGELY*'s anagram plays through the L at 6E, too. Can't fault either miss, though, esp. since I just missed a superior play there, too.
>Jason: BKOPSUU C2 KOB +35 244
#note I almost welcomed the second U, as it left but one Jeff could have for that still-juicy Q spot. I knew I couldn't play one, though. Jeff would have to read me for another and block the spot. Ducky calls this the clear play.
>Jeff_Clark: AENOORU 1D .UARE +42 210
#note Oh, that sucks like a vacuum cleaner. Esp. since I had (Q)UASH all set to go and Jeff threatens ONO at B2 for 30 next turn. Interestingly, sim says Jeff should play ONO first. QUARE's about 4-5 pts. behind.
>Jason: AHPSSUU B1 ASH +33 277
#note Have I mentioned I'm p*ssed about (Q)UASH being blocked? Jeff correctly put me on keeping the case S, but I don't feel like I need to have it to make this play (although it helped). Duck gives a slight edge to (KA)PH ... not sure how I feel about that. (-1.7)
>Jeff_Clark: NOOOOTZ 5A NOO +13 223
#note Incorrectly read as a fish instead of an "I have four O's" play. Little does Jeff know that now would be the perfect time to play ZOO, as I have zippo coming back. Sim likes ZOO, too, but I can't quibble with Jeff's choice here.
>Jason: GPRSUUY 6A UPS +34 311
#note I hate ditching the case S so soon, but it is 12 more, I'm not liking drawing into a 4C-1V leave with only 14 vowels unseen, and both blanks are still out. I feel that if I can get one, it'll be very hard for Jeff to win. Duck says this or P(L)UG at 6D. That spot's killed both of us. (-0.2)
>Jeff_Clark: EFOORTZ J3 FROZE +39 262
#note Duck says there's a star play here: Z(A), 1A. I'm not so sure.
>Jason: GHLRTUY 4H HU.RY +30 341
#note Helps my consonant-itis, dumps the clunk, doesn't open. But HURLY's better. One day I will learn to find my best play and find a better one. Sunday wasn't that day... (-1.8)
>Jeff_Clark: ACFILOT G4 COIF +27 289
#note Another "best*", neck-and-neck with his best "real" play, IF at J9.
>Jason: DEGGILT 2F GELD +21 362
#note (NU)GGET at A5 would've been cute. (-5.6)
>Jeff_Clark: ADILMTT 3L MILT +19 308
#note Or MITT. Jeff bites the bullet and opens, knowing it could be dangerous with both blanks still out.
>Jason: EGIRTVV O3 .RIVET +30 392
#note When Jeff opened the triple while I looked at VV as my first two, I thought ... well, it's not printable. Happy to see the only play. It's looking like outrun the bingo in a nailbiting endgame.
>Jeff_Clark: ??ABDPT 14D DAB +25 333
#note Nothing playable. Jeff, unlike me, can make a good pre-endgame play. (CP likes DAP, but this wins sim.)
>Jason: CGILNNV L3 ..C +10 402
#note Two things are obvious. 1) I can only play off one tile. 2) I'm in deep soup. These tiles don't exactly lend themselves to a nice overlap play after Jeff's inevitable bingo. N(E) at 7N is the valuation leader ... it is possible Jeff can't bingo after that. Two choices leads CP's list: GIV(E) at 7L the first. Again, with two I's out, a bingo isn't guaranteed after GIVE. The other one-tile play I considered, AVO, is also at 36.11%. (I knew I'd pick the wrong one...) This checks in at 12.5%. (-16.3)
>Jeff_Clark: ??INOPT 13G P..eONTIc +76 409
#note Jeff didn't see any potential win from this position, so he decided to save spread knowing I couldn't challenge anything I wasn't 100% sure was bad. (It's worth noting he finished four spread points ahead of Randy Greenspan for fourth.) However, there are three potential wins. (W)ayPOINT guarantees the win (didn't know that one). apPOINT at N8 (Jeff looked for bingos tripling the P, but didn't see it) wins 7/8 times, including by one when Jeff pulls the E. P(A) at 1A wins with an unblockable out bingo 3/8 times (however, I win after PA with (W)IVING). Props to Jeff for keeping a straight face while I held. :)
>Jason: GIILNNV N10 LIV.NG +24 426
#note I wil gladly take the equity hit for passing on VIN(I)NG. Not seeing the eight-points-better VIG(I)L, however, is just sloppy. A fun, fun game, even if we each made our share of mistakes. Overall, I thought Jeff played well.
