#note I want to begin by thanking Sue and Joe for letting me look over their shoulders and subject them to scrutiny. Please don't take any of the comments I give in this game personally. We're all just trying to improve! ANNOTATION BEGINS: As ugly as this rack looks at first, it's worth playing through. 8H THONG 22 is best. If you are going to exchange here, go ahead and throw the G back as well.
>Sue: EEGIIMO -EI +0 0
#note An exchange is certainly reasonable here, although Sue kept some tiles on her exchange that are better  back in the bag. First, there's no reason keep a leave that is 60% vowels since the ideal ratio is about two consonants for each vowel. Also, the I, O, and G tiles are better in the bag than on your rack. Remember, each extra tile you exhange means a better chance of drawing blanks, Ss, and powerful tiles like the X and Z. The best play is to exchange everything but the EM.
>Joe: ADGNPRT 8G PAD +12 12
#note 8D PRANG 22 is best. If you don't know PRANG, GRAND is a grand play.
>Sue: EEGIMOO 9G EGO +18 18
#note Nice play, Sue! While I4 GEOI(D) 8 gets rid of more vowels, it sacrifices quite a lot in terms of score and board position.
>Joe: GNORRST 10G GOT +18 30
#note The right idea, but an improvement would be 10F GROT 22 or 10G GOR 18. Since we can undouble our Rs, why not do so?
>Sue: AEIIIMO 11I EM +9 27
#note This is a clear exchange rack. There is nowhere to score, and we must shed some of these vowels. Keeping EM, or maybe AEM, is best. Sue's actual play leaves the dreadful AIIIO, and also opens up a huge hotspot at K11, all for a measly 9 points. 
>Joe: INOPRRS 11C PORNS +21 51
#note The top plays all take advantage of the DOTE-R hook (e.g., 12H PRION 30 or 12H PRIOR 30). If you're unsure of that hook, K6 PRIONS 26, hooking EM-S is not bad.
>Sue: ?AIIIOZ 12J OI +6 33
#note Here Sue must now pay the penalty for keeping the three Is on her previous turn. The two tiles she's just drawn are excellent, one for its power and one for its flexibility, but that triplicated Is leave Sue without a lot of options. I would either exchange and keep [AIZ?] or maybe try to play through the muck with 12C AI. 
>Joe: AEIORVW 12B VAW +32 83
#note While Joe's VAW is a fine play, 12A VIEW 42 is a small improvement. Also available was the cool 12B VIREO 28.
>Sue: ?AIINOZ 13K NAZI +28 61
#note Great play, Sue. It's as good as anything here.
>Joe: ?AGINOR F11 .O +2 85
#note O7 ORIGANs is one of those 'Scrabble words' that's one of the more probable sevens, but Joe's been on hiatus for a long enough time that we won't beat him up over missing it. A little patience probably would have yielded something like M7 ORGANI(Z)e 70 or 14F ROArING/ROAmING/etc. 
>Sue: ?AILNOQ 14M AN +19 80
#note You don't have to have a bingo to score bingo points; N10 QuA(I)L scores a hefty 66 and is worth spending the blank. Another option is J7 QI, but it requires knowing the PAD-I hook.
>Joe: ?AEFGIR 15G FEARInG +93 178
#note Sue made Joe's job a lot easier with that ZA-G setup! Joe's play is clearly best.
>Sue: ?EILOOQ 14F QI +36 116
#note Sue's QI is best.
>Joe: ACDEELL 13C LED +24 202
#note Joe found the right place, but could have made a small improvement with either CEL or DEL.
>Sue: ?AEHLOO H12 HOs. +21 137
#note This is the kind of temptation that our newer players must learn to resist. This play throws the blank away for nothing, since there were lots of plays that scored just as well and kept the it. Any time you play a blank (or, to a lesser extent, another premium tile like an S, X, or Z), ask yourself if you're getting a good return on your investment. Most experts demand around 35 extra points in order to justify spending a blank in ordinary situations, and while your threshold might be lower, don't let it fall so low that you miss the advantage that the blanks should offer when you draw them. That said, all of the top plays did tricky overlaps like 10C OHO 24, 10A HAOLE 25, or 10B HOLE 30, and if you don't see those opportunities, this board doesn't offer much else.
>Joe: ABCDELR 8G ...DLE +11 213
#note The top plays take advantage of the K11 hotspot that's flown under the radar so far. Playing from 11I, options include (EM)BRACE for 36 or (EM)BED for 30. The next best area underlapped PAL and OWE in the lower-left corner. BLED, CRED, BRED, or BALD play from 14A, all for 28. 
>Sue: AACELOO K5 CEL. +12 149
#note With doubled As and Os, and with a 5-vowel rack, we should avoid CELL like the plague. It keeps both duplicated sets, and it plays off our only consonants. If at all possible, we want to avoid that. For instance, LOCA(L)E to the same L undoubles both sets and gets rid of three vowels instead of only one.  (The best play is 10B COLA 27, but that's beside the point--I want to focus on helping our up-and-coming players make BETTER plays, and eventually we'll worry about finding the BEST play.)
>Joe: ABCEIIR 6I IC. +11 224
#note Key optins: hook PADDLE-R with ICIER for 19, 5E ACERBI(C), or (EM)BRACE at 11I.
>Sue: AAAOORX 7K .OX +20 169
#note I'll take a break from the basics to point out a cool setup option: M6 OAR. Notice that it sets up a huge hotspot at N6 for our X. Sometimes it gets blocked, but then we still have AX in the bottom right corner for 30 on the next play anyway. And when it doesn't get blocked, it gets us right back into the game (for example, the simple AX scores 50, but if we can extend the play to N2, we can score in the 80 range).
>Joe: ABEIJLR H1 JAILER +48 272
#note Definitely best. Nice play, Joe.
>Sue: AAANORY O14 YA +21 190
#note No problem with this one.
>Joe: BEEFHNU I2 EF +20 292
#note Joe's play is right up there with the top plays, so there's no reason to nitpick.
>Sue: AAINORT 6M OR +13 203
#note 4A RATIONA(L) 68 (or its anagram NOTARIAL) would have kept the door open on this contest.Ignoring the bingo, we can still improve on OR with AR in the same place--if we're going to fish, we might as well rid ourselves of one of those As.
>Joe: BEHKNUY O6 BUNK +35 327
#note The best play.
>Sue: AAINRTU D10 T...R +8 211
#note 9M AU(K), which Sue mentioned to me at the time, was probably the best play. It can't be right to play off two of our only three consonants. 
>Joe: EEEHRTY 14B HE. +18 345
#note Had Joe known the ridiculous word TOWERY, he could have cashed big here with THEY for 58. Another really cool play: 3C ETHER(IF)Y! Yeah, let's dream of the day we see plays like that!
>Sue: AAIINNU 15A AI +11 222
#note 4C UNNAI(L) 12 is best, although there's really no way to win at this point.
>Joe: EERSTTY 12N YE +12 357
#note 3B RETEST(IF)Y! 
>Sue: AIMNNSU 5E MIN. +12 234
#note UNNAI(L)S.
>Joe: BERSSTT 13G R.B +16 373
#note R(O)B is as good as anything else here.
>Sue: ADNSTUV 4D VAT +18 252
#note VAT is pretty good where Sue played it, but was slightly better vertically, hooking A-MINE.
>Joe: EEISSTT 10L TIES +17 390
#note At the time I pointed out to Joe that Sue had just blocked the nine TEST(IF)IES. At this point, they're just playing out the tiles.
>Sue: DNSUUUW 15A ..D +12 264
#note Ugly final draw for Sue! It doesn't really matter, given the score, but it sure looks bad. Sue was close, but should have tacked the S on for and extra 12 points.
>Joe: ESTT E3 T..E +6 396
#note Funny how close Joe was to the out play TAMEST!
>Sue: NSUUUW 2G W..S +9 273
#note I didn't write down their final plays, so don't pay attention to anything else. Thanks again, Joe and Sue, for letting us use your game as a learning tool.
