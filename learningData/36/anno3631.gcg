>moh: AAEIKNZ 10H NAZI +42 42
#note Or 10E AZINE 43.
>dave: AEEILRT I2 ATELIER +66 82
#note LATERI(Z)E is a small improvement.
>moh: ADEKORU H1 UKE +29 71
#note Best.
>dave: AFT J2 FAT +37 119
>moh: ?ADNORY 11I RANDY +35 106
#note K5 nONDA(I)RY 94! Even if I miss that, I should see OrD(I)NARY. RANDY is the best non-bingo.
>dave: GOTV K7 VOT..G +10 129
>moh: ?ACFJNO M7 FANC. +18 124
#note The computer likes M9 JO(Y)ANCe 52, but I'm not thrilled about spending my blank for 52 while opening huge hotspots along row 15 and at N10. I thought about JO(Y), and it holds up pretty well in the sim, but I was overly worried about a huge comeback parallel to N10 (COX, for instance, would have made me very unhappy). I'm not sure what the best play is, but FANC(Y) is a pretty weak play. 
>dave: ABCDHIV G3 BACH +23 152
#note The computer likes N4 DIVA 21 a little better than BACH, but that seems pretty insane. I think BACH is much better.
>moh: ??EIJOS 12C rEJOInS +77 201
#note Tons of options with both blanks. N2 JOLLIES or JIngOES are probably best.
>dave: DEGITUV 6D VUG. +15 167
#note 8K (O)V(A)TE 36 is best, with your VUGH second.
>moh: AHLMOSX 13D LOX +30 231
#note My LOX wins the sim. There really aren't as many options as you'd expect with this rack.
>dave: ADEITTW D3 WAI.ED +30 197
#note Your WAI(V)ED sims second-best behind N2 DAWTIE 29.
>moh: AHLMSUY C7 HAM +27 258
#note I thought MUHLY was good (at 14A for 42), but I second-guessed myself. I didn't like how much 14F YUM 37 offered back to you, and I thought the spot would still be there next turn for me to take a shot at it. So I kept the key Y tile and took HAM, which is in the middle of the pack in the sim.
>dave: INRSTTT 8M .TT +9 206
#note E5 T(U)T 16 wins the sim, with the interesting setup E12 (JO)T just behind. I don't think you're desperate enough to try the setup, and your (A)TT it next-best.
>moh: ELNSUUY 14D LEY +48 306
#note Hated the leave, but loved both the score and the -S hook setup, since I had an S.
>dave: INRST 8A TR.. +15 221
>moh: BGNPSUU 15A BUGS +29 335
#note Or PUBS or PUGS in the same spot. All of them make me about a 200-to-1 favorite.
>dave: EINORSS O5 OES.RINS +59 280
#note It doesn't really matter which side of the baord you play it on, and it's the only one available.
>moh: DINPQRU 5B QU.N +30 365
#note Easy choice, as it scores well and partially blocks the only lane (although an argument can be made for the full block of A4 QUIR(T)).
>dave: EEIIILO N12 OIL +8 288
>moh: ADEIPPR K5 PI...... +28 393
#note Best.
>dave: EEIINOO 3C E.E +12 300
>moh: ADEEIPR L1 PAIRED +31 424
>dave: DEINOOR 1L .OOD +21 321
>moh: E 7M .E. +8 432
#note HAME scores one more point.
