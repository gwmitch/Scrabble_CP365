#note This is a must win game.  Idalski and I are both 5-1, and Jason has about 150 points of spread on me at this point, and he's playing Bowman.  A very good time for a no brainer rack to start my game.  I immediately take note of the CON extension possibility.

>Pete: ACIIIST H8 .ITI +4 82
#note Worst thing is, I figured that there might be something with this ugly ass rack.  I was overprotective of the C- I saw the cool extension, and didn't want to let it go.  ISATINIC is the winner, and failing that, IODIC or IRIDIC work well.

#note this, AW 10E (which I considered) and WAP 6H are best, with

>Pete: CIILSUZ J10 I.LU +7 121
#note Trying to fish for a big Z play.  Duck says ZIN is best.  IGLU does better than I suspected it would.
>Kevin_McCarthy: EQST 13I Q.EST +48 117
>Pete: ACIIRSZ L9 IZAR. +28 149
#note Strangely, burning the S for the additional 21 points never occured to me.  Idiot.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ?BEILMO N8 OBELIsM +88 205
>Pete: CHIINSS O7 CHIN +48 197
#note CHIS sims a touch better.  With multiple S spots, I didn't mind the double S.

#note ODEA there wins.

>Pete: AEOOPSX 14B APO +24 284
#note Best.  And I considered blocking the hotspot ay 14F the previous turn... Lucky me.

#note With this rack, game over, right?  Well, only if you remember the correct bingo.

>Pete: CEEORST --  -140 336
#note And I brick again, getting greedy and going for the 3X3.  At least at this point, I see the actual bingoes.

>Pete: CEEORST 3G CORTE.ES +80 416
#note draws a hold.  Keving didn't know it, but seeing his rack, and seeing what I'd draw, he thought it was game over.  When I saw, so did I.  I was already cursing my hubris and idiocy.
>Kevin_McCarthy: DEEIJKR E2 JERKIE. +36 437
#note Actual rack.  Sim says this wins 100%... not true.  It leaves a one point win for me, if I can find it.  JERKER wins.
>Pete: AAEOR 2J AR.AE +31 447
#note After sulking for a good minute or so about giving the game away, I start looking for cool plays.  With the Idalski/Bowman game ongoing next to me, I knew spread could be important for staying in second.  I look at the top right, and see that the triple letter will at least let me make a respectable score with my crap rack. then I look at the options, and realize I can hit the DWS with AREAE.  I do the math... and then, I look for his D plays.  I can't see anything better than 7.  More math.  Holy shit.  AREAE wins... I think/hope.

#note Rather than take the sure loss, Kevin tries the phoney for the win.
>Pete: O 2E .O +11 458
#note Missing CHINO/LO for an additional point.  I was still in shock I found AREAE.  It's one of my best plays under pressure that I can recall.
