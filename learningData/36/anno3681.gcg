>Sam: ADHIJQS 8D JIHAD +48 48
#note Did not even consider Quackle's favorite move, QAIDS 8D. Is that seriously better? QAIDS is obvious with the old dictionary, but I don't mind JIHAD at all.
>Robert_Ellickson: BGORU 7G BOURG +22 22
>Sam: AFNQSSS I6 F.SS +25 73
#note I chose between FANS and FUSS, and Quackle prefers FANS by four points. I guess an extra S could come in handy for the Q, and it is three more points. FUSS wasn't bad, but either way I have to get rid of the Q, and FANS ensures I'll have another S left over.

>Sam: AEILLST 15A ILL +18 192
#note I'm glad I turned bingoes hooking to make SCOD, but I missed BALLISTAE G7! Also, despite considering LAT, I didn't think about LA A13, which is clearly the best non-bingo.
>Robert_Ellickson: IO K3 .OI +20 159
>Sam: AAEIIST 1L .AIT +18 210
#note Missed both ATONIA and CODEIA.
>Robert_Ellickson: ?AGINOR O1 .ROAkING +77 236
#note TRIGONAl would have been three more points.

#note Challenge
>Sam: DEEELSU F8 .EED +28 398
#note Didn't see EDUCE for the balanced leave.
>Robert_Ellickson: ADEEV H11 EV.DE +39 275
#note Laid down EVADA* by accident first, and came so close to hitting his clock--that would have gifted me a lot of spread points.
>Sam: AELNSUZ M6 UNSLEAZ. +72 470
>Sam: AELNSUZ --  -72 398
#note Thought I remembered Joe Gaspard playing this on me at Chicago--turns out he played UNSEXUAL.

>Sam: AELNSUZ 6F ZA +36 434
>Robert_Ellickson: EIMT M7 MITE +18 315
>Sam: EELNSUU F13 .UE +7 441
#note Shoulda gone LEU, I was wary of the P hook but that gives me counterplay to the triple anyway.
>Robert_Ellickson: OP A13 PO. +22 337
>Sam: EELNOSU L9 LEU +11 452
#note Didn't see the nice out-in-two of ENROL. 
>Robert_Ellickson: ?EITUY 12G E.e +11 348
#note EqUID is best
>Sam: ENOS 12B ...E +16 468
#note FINALS is three better, giving me ONE E3 after YUTZ.
