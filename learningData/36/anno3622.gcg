#note TIBIA 9E (Suggested by Quackle) looks slightly better.
>Tony_Verma: AALS M10 AALS +19 62
#note I did not check the score on his play.  A habit I ought to start doing.  He says "20".
>Adam_Henderson: ABEINOT L1 BENTO +29 104

#note Quackle prefers a number of plays; OIDIA (9F), QUAI, UNCIA, ACINI, UNAI.  Exchanges don't even come to Quackle's mind.  I exchanged all but the consonants.  I like OIDIA and ACINI now that I see those plays.  I probably would have played OIDIA had I seen it now.

>Adam_Henderson: AACDETT M5 TAC. +19 123
#note Scored as 21.  We are terrible counters!  Quackle likes DOAT (L7), TACET and TECTA (both worth 27) better.

>Adam_Henderson: ABEHORU G13 HER +24 267
#note Quackle likes a number of things (HER isn't one of them).  The idea behind HER was to try to block Tony's next move, since he surely has at least one blank.  Perhaps I was also thinking that by providing him with ED and RE to bingo through, he might trip up and push too hard for a bingo...

#note An extra O must have materialized somehow.

#note for some reason my scoresheet has recorded that he got 10 points from me at the end instead of 6.  I don't know why.
