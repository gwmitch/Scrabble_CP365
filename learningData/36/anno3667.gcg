#note this play should serve as evidence of the underestimation all of you do regarding the lowest div players
>Max_Karten: EEELNTU 9B ELUE.T +8 38
#note LEU I3 i guess makes more sense but I wanted to open what I already saw as a board closing itself up and I wanted to use more tiles to try and either get something to score with or a blank/S

>Max_Karten: AABEENO E4 BOA +17 55
>Jane_Conti: CDER D8 C.RED +28 120
>Max_Karten: ADEELNR E11 DEL +17 72
#note totally missed ANELED, a word I know but have never played. DEL over the other close choices just to open it with a real strong leave. I put down LEARNED/D(ELUENT) but she dumped her rack on the table before I had added up the play or hit my clock so i took it back, it seemed like a legit bluff in the situation, she mentioned after the game was over how it was a big mistake to do what she did and it definitely ended up costing her
>Jane_Conti: IO F13 OI +6 126
#note I said 'oh how do you know I dont have another L? oh yeah cause I just showed you all my letters!' ... she didnt find it funny.

>Max_Karten: AEEGNOR J2 NOG +12 96
#note yes, this made little to no sense, I agree. At this point I was getting frustrated, didn't think EE was that bad considering how many were already out, guess im lucky she didnt know SNOG, which I hesitated pretty strongly on when I played it, probably partially because she passed it up.
>Jane_Conti: ?EEGINS K4 SEEdING +71 209
>Max_Karten: AENNORZ I8 AZON +25 121
#note wasnt into keeping NN at this point, was pretty disappointed to get the S next turn (as disappointed as you can be to get an S i suppose) after ruing not having it for IZARS on this turn.
>Jane_Conti: CEIR 8K .CIER +30 239
>Max_Karten: AENRSUU 10K .URU +7 128
#note the only UNAU play that makes sense is J11, partially because I didnt like closing the lanes for 8s through the IER in ICIER. exch UU, UNSURE, and AUREUS (which I didnt even know) all make no sense to me
>Jane_Conti: W 3I W. +19 258
>Max_Karten: AEINOQS M7 Q. +21 149
#note (E)Q(U)INE leaving the monster S hook was a thought I dismissed cause it was too far fetched to work all that well, and if I play QIS H1 I'm not bingoing with a 7 without an L so i nixed that too
>Jane_Conti: PPU G11 PUP +18 276
>Max_Karten: AEIMNOS 1D ANOMIES +85 234
>Jane_Conti: AADRRSV -  +0 276
#note she held for a while, I wasnt into her challenging SNOG so much so I just wrote ANOMIES on the slip and handed it to her to bring to the machine. Apparently that wasnt sly enough cause she added SNOG to the sheet before she got up from the table haha
>Max_Karten: AINOOTX 2E OXO +57 291
#note going from being down 127 to up by 15 in literally less than 30 seconds in a penultimate game of a 3 dayer is one sweet feeling
>Jane_Conti: T C9 ..T +7 283
>Max_Karten: AIIIJNT C2 INTI +17 308
#note one of the weirder situations I was faced with, almost did TAJ C2 and was even closer to doing JIN H10 (which quackle says wins 10% more of the time) but I just couldnt rationalize leaving all 1 point tiles plus II at this point in this game with this board. not exactly sure how ANTI wins more often but ok quackle? didnt even see (N)INJA, probably wouldve passed it up as too dangeous if I had
>Jane_Conti: HHS H13 SHH +33 316
>Max_Karten: ?AEIJRV 14H .EJIRAs +64 372
#note one of the more exciting plays I've ever had, I figured the possibility of her 8'ing to the R in ICIER was so low that it was okay to totally empty the bag, didnt envision any scenario where I draw a rack that she can win by outscoring me without bingoing although there are one or two very unlikely situations where that couldve happened. also was banking on a challenge, which after about a minute of holding and tracking, she reluctantly made. Just glad HEJIRA took S as I thought it did but then again I almost balked on SNOG so I was kind of unsure of something like this at this point. Couldnt have asked for a much cooler penultimate play in a penultimate game of a 3 dayer though, I was really psyched when the challenge came back good.
