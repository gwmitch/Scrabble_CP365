>Dominic_Grillo: DOOW 8F WOOD +16 16
>Jason: AEFILNP G7 F.P +15 15
#note Duck likes FIE at 9G. I guess so, 26 instead of 15, PLAN instead of ALIEN. (-5.7)
>Dominic_Grillo: AOV F5 AVO. +23 39
>Jason: AAEILNS I7 A. +4 19
#note Oddly, A(A) at 5E is vastly better. (-7.8)
>Dominic_Grillo: LUU 5D LU.U +8 47
>Jason: AEILNOS J5 ANISOLE +72 91
>Dominic_Grillo: DNO K5 NOD +18 65
>Jason: AACGIIO L3 AGIO +16 107
>Dominic_Grillo: EHILNRS 11E HENRI.S +40 105
#note (Dom's exact rack.)
>Jason: ?ACDIIT 12C CAID +22 129
#note Didn't know DIA(L)yTIC, but no excuse for missing CI(L)IATeD. (-20.4)
>Dominic_Grillo: CLM 3J CL.M +16 121
>Jason: ?ADINTX 4C TAX +33 162
#note (R)ADIX, H11. (-4.3)
>Dominic_Grillo: ?EKRZ H1 ZERKs +70 191
#note Or ZERK at 10B. As you'll see this decision proves pivotal.
>Jason: ?ADEIMN 1H .EMINDAr +110 272
#note While Dom was counting, I thought "Huh, wouldn't it be nice if I could play from the Z. (pause) Wait, I can." I put this down while Dom's hand was still in the bag, and his head drooped. Scott Appel also visibly reacted, but I think it was more the speed at which this went down than the word itself. What can I say? It just clicked.
>Dominic_Grillo: EHLWY 2E WHE.LY +51 242
#note Whoa. Lest I start planning my acceptance speech. It didn't occur to me until well later that this might be phony, but it is.
>Jason: AERTUUY 1A YURTA +32 304
#note Given this comeback, I would've had to be pretty sure to challenge WHEELY*. I momentarily panicked with him within thirty while I had UUY, but after I played this and drew JS on the pick, I had a stranglehold on the game again.
>Dominic_Grillo: BEEGINR 2N BE +17 259
#note (Dom's exact rack.) GREEN(WOODS) would've been sick.
>Jason: EEEIJSU C9 JUI.E +44 348
>Dominic_Grillo: EGGINRR 10B R.G +6 265
#note (Dom's exact rack.)
>Jason: EERSSTT A5 STREETS +76 424
#note Yeah, I pulled RSTT into EES. That's been my year so far. (-3.2)
>Dominic_Grillo: EGINNRT O1 ..RENTING +80 345
#note Heh. Why not a nine? This game had just about everything else. Dom played great ... a shame he wasn't given more to work with.
>Jason: EEIOQTV N7 QI +24 448
#note With two Q spots, (R)EVET at H11 is best by two.
>Dominic_Grillo: ABFIOP B13 FOB +21 366
#note Q says P(R)OA or P(R)AO at H10 is three better.
>Jason: EEOTV 3A VOE +16 464
#note Missing (R)EVET again. (-7.0)
>Dominic_Grillo: AIP M8 PIA +11 377
>Dominic_Grillo:  (ET) +4 381
