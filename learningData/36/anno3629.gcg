>Sam: IMORRWX 8F WORM +18 18
#note This is a bad play. I overthought it--probably rarely worth it to do something like this, unless it opens both DLSs and puts a V or C in the middle, or something like that. WORM 8G looks best.

>Sam: BEIIORX K3 IBEX +45 63
>Ed_Horch: EOPR F6 PO.ER +18 44
>Sam: IMORTUV E4 OVUM +26 89
#note I saw three options here: OVUM, TRIVIUM 3G, and TIRO L3. I didn't consider VUM E5. After 3,000 iterations, OVUM is simming best, but all four plays are closely grouped (spread of 1.6 from OVUM to TIRO). Deciding between TRIVIUM and OVUM, I weighed the factors and then basically guessed and hoped OVUM was better. They seemed pretty close though. VUM seems interesting, especially with a board mostly devoid of bingo possibilities, and it keeps IORT for the L column. I think that too many times VUM will be followed by Ed playing on the L column, and I won't have many opportunities, so I might as well take the improved leave and two points of OVUM. IORT doesn't bingo much.
>Ed_Horch: ADO L4 ADO +33 77
>Sam: EEILNRT M3 EL +9 98
#note Quackle prefers BAL 4K by a significant margin. I can't argue with it: EEINRT hits 52/70 tiles for sevens. According to the sim it bingos 85% or so next turn, compared to 60% for EL. Those numbers seem reasonable. I felt like ENTOILER had a decent chance of staying, but wasn't going to play it.
>Ed_Horch: AIOU I8 .IAOU +8 85
>Sam: EGINRTU 5C GU. +7 105
#note Quackle likes UT D3, which again seems like a good play. I think I got too enamored with EINRT. 
>Ed_Horch: DHIN J10 HIND +33 118
>Sam: EEIKNRT H1 TINKERE. +101 206
#note Oops, I didn't see the spot for KERNITE. 
>Ed_Horch: ERW 2F WE.R +15 133
>Sam: ?DEHLOT H12 HOLD +46 252
#note Easy decision to pass up the N4 bingoes.
>Ed_Horch: III -III +0 133
>Sam: ??ELPTT G7 P.T +23 275
#note Um, not a good play. Couldn't find any bingoes to the D. Wasn't sure of LETUP. Couldn't find PaLETTe. Didn't know PELTasT. Boo.

>Sam: CEISSTU O7 ICTUSES +96 490
#note I was more sure of ICTUSES than CUTISES, knowing CUTES was a plural of CUTIS; turns out they're both good. 
>Ed_Horch: EJLO E9 JOLE +34 232
>Sam: EGINSTZ 13C ZEST +38 528
#note Champ Player likes GETS 13B, setting up ZING at minimum. My play is second. I really didn't want to put the Z at 13A or 13B given the pool. ZEE 13D is another interesting option. Not sure how to quantify these plays really, and not sure I care with this score.
>Ed_Horch: AFR D10 FAR. +26 258
>Sam: AGINNSY C2 SNA.GY +30 558
#note I went overtime! and still made this shitty play. Best is N9 IN, setting up the out-in-two. I knew there was an out-in-two there, which is why I spent time looking. Don't think I'd go over in a tourney, but still, weak.
>Ed_Horch: AABET B6 ABET +20 278
#note Missing AbATE.
