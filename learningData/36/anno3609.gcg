#note Just ahead of WIMP, which I considered.

#note As Grob would say: best*.

#note One fortunate draw and zero equity loss so far, and I finally feel like more than a spectator in this game.
>Dominic_Grillo: IQ 12C QI +30 182
>Jason: ?EJMNRV D2 J.N +20 178
#note Had eight I's in this game, but none here, which was a little frustrating. Missed (U)NJ(A)M. (-15.9)
>Dominic_Grillo: INX 13B NIX +54 236
#note Owie.
>Jason: ?ELMORV M3 VOMER +30 208
#note And minus eleventy billion for missing the bingo which Keller, sitting next to me, saw. (I think I remember playing REMOVAL natural once, too.) And I haven't even made my worst mistake yet! (-13.0)
>Dominic_Grillo: DLOT K3 DOLT +16 252
>Jason: ?AEEIIL 5E E.A +19 227
#note Yeah, I deserved this five-vowel draw. (PIX)IE's daring, but nice. Didn't see it. (-6.5)
>Dominic_Grillo: DEKO H11 .OKED +33 285
>Jason: ?EIIILU -IIU +0 227
#note Still paying for missing REMOVAL. It's looking like bingo next turn or lose.
>Dominic_Grillo: F I11 .F +10 295
#note I think Dom said he drew into SATIRE, meaning he missed the spot for the layup. But I could be wrong.
>Jason: ?EEILLO 15B OEILLa.E +59 286
#note Glad to see this, but nIELLOE(D) scores 18 more. (-17.2)
>Dominic_Grillo: AEIORST 2F .O +6 301
#note (Dom's exact rack.)
>Jason: ?ABEGGN 1G NAG +17 303
#note How many ways is this play stupid? Let's count. 1) It's not even the best block. BAG or BEG at J2 is better. Tunnel vision. Or better yet is Q's suggestion, the cute GAEN at L1. 2) Why block? I've got a good rack myself. Score decently to bring it back to even, I can still win a close endgame. Instead I hamstring myself and depend on the bag to bail me out. Bad, bad, bad. (-13.8)
>Dominic_Grillo: AEEIRST 14E EAT.RIES +71 372
#note Worthy of a "nice fit", but why not SERIATE at N7 to almost totally kill the board?
>Jason: ?ABCEGT J2 CAB +20 323
#note Note that if I'd played BAG here last turn (like Q says I shoul now), I'd have CoGNATE or CoAGENT. Fishing for RE(C)ITING/TIERING or something else unblockable, hence the reason to ditch the C. Somehow, still better than 50-50 to win, says CP. Although it's 70% after BAG. (-15.5)
>Dominic_Grillo: INO N4 ION +20 392
#note Nice block.
>Jason: ?EEGGST C5 T.EGnS +10 333
#note Obviously I didn't see GE(Y)S until after I played this. Only I can lose zero equity in the first five turns and make six 13+ point mistakes the next eight turns. I definitely drew well enough to be at least 13-1. Way too many mistakes. (-15.0)
