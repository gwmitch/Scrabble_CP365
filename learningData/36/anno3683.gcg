#note I didn't consider ZED M2, which the sim likes more. I liked how ZERO takes away any S-ending bingoes. ZED has a clearly better leave though. Then again I don't love giving up a 35-45 point play without a ZA hook tile to come back with. ZED does keep the O for parallel plays at least. ZED's probably better, but I don't hate ZERO at all.

#note There are a bunch of options that can't be immediately ruled out here--AURUM, AUK, URANIUM, ULU, and DURUM. Quackle's favorite is DUMA K2, which I didn't consider. That seems fine to me, as the points make up for the crappy leave.

>Sam: AEFNNOY 10E FANE +37 180
#note My decision was between FANE and FOGEY N2, which a two-ply sim prefers by four or so. I went with FANE because it seemed safer given INCH, which to me meant he either had a reasonably bingo-prone leave (ENRT or something) or was consonant-heavy, which could both punish FOGEY on the O line. I'm not convinced FANE is better, but I did like it more at the time.

>Sam: DEJLNOR A12 JOLE +76 375
#note Quackle likes JOLE, but I didn't consider JEON, which dangles an N instead of an E for eights. JOLE is probably better because of its more flexible leave, though, I would think. JEON is still interesting though.
