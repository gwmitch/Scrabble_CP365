>moh: IMNOSTW 8G MOWN +18 18
#note It's a tossup between MOW and MOWN. WOT holds up surprisingly well.
>jsp: AEINNSZ J6 ZI. +32 32
>moh: DIISSTT 9J SIT +16 34
#note I didn't get the E for DITSIEST, so I just undouble my three duplications.
>jsp: HNORY L9 .HORNY +24 56
#note Been there, done that.
>moh: DILOSTT 9F TOD +13 47
#note TOD sims better on top of MOWN, I guess because it gives me a place for -S bingos. 7H DO(I)T is probably best.
>jsp: AEU M13 EAU +15 71
>moh: EEILSTW N12 TEW +33 80
#note I was hoping for WELLSITE or LEWISITE, but you were stingy with giving me letters. TEW is best.
>jsp: AINOR O8 NORIA +21 92
>moh: DEHILRS M9 HID +30 110
#note N3 HIRSLED 68! I had the distinct feeling that I'd had this rack on Zyzzyva recently, but I just couldn't find it. My HID is next-best.
>jsp: EGLO 10E LOGE +21 113
>moh: EGILNRS 11K G.. +10 120
#note Now this miss is many times more embarrassing than SITH. Of course I saw LINGERS (and its anagrams and mnemonic), but I totally went to sleep on the S-MOG hook! (I was even surprised when you eventually played JARS there!)
>jsp: AEEO 6J .OEAE +16 129
>moh: EIILNRS 11D LI +8 128
#note Same story, different turn. Yeah, I saw INLIERS, and yeah, I didn't see SMOG. No explanation; just a stupid miss.
>jsp: CLU L3 CLU. +12 141
>moh: EINPQRS -Q +0 128
#note If there were more unseen Is, PIN(C)ER would be pretty interesting, setting myself up for QI next turn. If I draw an I, it's 64, but even without it, I earn 31 next turn. The sim winner is QI, followed by QIS, and then throwing back the Q.
>jsp: ?EINRSU 12D INSUREd +71 212
#note A ton of options, all about the same.
>moh: EINOPRS N1 ISOPR.NE +72 200
>jsp: DV 1M V.D +21 233
>moh: AAKNTTV 13B TANK +27 227
#note Best.
>jsp: FIX 14A FIX +39 272
>moh: ABEMTTV 15A ATE +37 264
#note Hated the leave, but c'est la vie.
>jsp: EOP H12 .OPE +18 290
>moh: BBDMRTV K5 M.D +23 287
#note The only non-exchanges that are even reasonable are M(O)D at 13G and at K5. I didn't like keeping that drek, but I didn't think I could come back with a lost turn on this closed board, so I played to keep close and crossed my fingers.
>jsp: ?AAAFLU -?AA +0 290
>moh: BBEERTV 15F BR.VET +11 298
#note 3J VE(C)T(O)R 22 is best. 
>jsp: AY O3 YA +16 306
>moh: ?BEGLQU 3L .L.. +18 316
#note K9 (I)G(G) 12 is the sim winner, but I don't really see why. My CLOY is not far behind.
>jsp: AJRS 7D JARS +20 326
>moh: ?BCEGQU E5 QU.G +28 344
>jsp: AAEFI F4 AI +13 339
#note Not a lot of options at this point.
