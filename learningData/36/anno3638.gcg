#note Elaine Glowniak played Tyler Hannan next to us. "This is a little intimidating, isn't it?" Chuck said to Elaine, pointing at me. I laughed. When Chuck found out I was going first, he said: "Any more advantages you want?" "Both blanks and both C's," I deadpanned.

#note Duck prefers the E11 placement a bit. (-0.4)

#note Forgot about the -D hook to AERIE. VIED, 15A. (-11.7)

#note Outstanding find, Chuck. :)

#note Missing BANDIT, 15A. (-10.5)
>Chuck_Armstrong: ?CENOPR J2 CORPs.EN +69 250
#note As I tracked this, I noticed that Chuck could've played PORCiNE (or CREPONs) along row 15. I wondered if he missed the AERIE hook. Either way, it's halftime (50 tiles played) and I'm down 102 with a mediocre rack. Not looking good.
>Jason: ACDENUY 4H CU.DY +28 176
#note At least I'm done missing the -D hook to AERIE. DECAY is the play. (-20.8)
>Chuck_Armstrong: ABM 6G BAM. +21 271
>Jason: AELLLNT K8 LALL +12 188
#note I'm thinking this LLLT draw sealed my fate. I'm reminding myself that I was 5-0 and that it's possible to win at 6-1 with a good spread; don't let this get out of control. Just keep making my best play and hopefully good things will happen. Lately, they have been.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 271
#note Chuck's passing six with ?SSSQX out is a good sign. I was about to throw in the towel given my rack.

>Jason: ?EEINOT A4 EbONITE +76 285
#note Chuck gave the Joel Horn-esque "of course I gave him a spot to bingo" hands up in the air after I laid this down (not as animated, of course, though). I've never seen Chuck show emotion mid-game before. (Q likes ONETImE a little better, to the tune of 0.3 equity.)
>Chuck_Armstrong: Q 12A Q. +21 320
>Jason: AGINRSX B5 AX +51 336
#note It took me a few seconds to realize that in a matter of minutes, I'd gone from "dead and buried" to "favorite" thanks to two luckbox draws. With four E's out, I felt that I was almost guaranteed to bingo again, esp. on this board.

>Chuck_Armstrong: AEGISTW 9A ..W +10 350
#note Chuck's exact rack. CP says this gives him the best chance to win; the only play coming in over 50%. Of course, that's with me with a random rack.
>Jason: EGINRSS O2 SINGERS +88 436
#note Whiffed on SIGNERS. I considered fishing off the S, as I figured I bingo with any draw but the H and could only lose to Chuck's out bingo. (CP agrees and says to play S(AX).) But I figured this outran any potential out bingo by Chuck. It is a guaranteed win. (-7.1)
>Chuck_Armstrong: AEEGIST 11H EGA.ITES +59 409
#note "I had three bingos," Chuck lamented after the game. "That's usually enough. (pause) Against *normal* people." Well, nobody's ever called me normal.
