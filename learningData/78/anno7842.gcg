#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: EHILNPS E4 PINH.LES +102 102
#note Well drawn, Jim!  And well played, too.  This is best; any of the placements of PLENISH give up way too much on the scoreboard.
>Paul_Holser: ABEGT D10 BEGAT +22 60
>Jim_Burlant: AHMNPVY 13C V.MPY +38 140
#note Best.
>Paul_Holser: CEGILRS H2 CLERGI.S +62 122
#note 6B CLINGERS/CRINGLES score 71.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAHNRV 9G A.H +23 163
#note Wow, I had no idea VERANDA took a back H.  Wihtout knowing VERANDAH, either this or 6B VARNA is best.  I didn't feel this rack needed to be turned, and certainly it shouldn't be that tough to draw into a bingo with all the unseen vowels, right?  
>Paul_Holser: OW D3 WO +18 140
>Jim_Burlant: ?AFMNRV C3 AM +25 188
#note Really had no idea what to do here, but this is the right idea with the wrong execution.  I probalby should have turned the N and played NAM, which wins the sim.  I get docked quite a bit for this choice.  
>Paul_Holser: ADEFIQR -ADEF +0 140
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFNRTV 4G F.RVENT +26 214
#note There are no bingos in this position.  This is best, with F2 FRET and 2A VENT also meriting consideration.
>Paul_Holser: ?ADDEET K3 D.fEATED +68 208
#note While Paul has a number of bingo options, the bingo isn't his best play.  Having said that, most humans aren't going to find the best play of F5 DEA(N)ED in this position.  His best bingo is M2 AT(T)EnDED for 7. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?KLLOOU L9 LOOK +21 235
#note Now my problems start.  This is best.  Where are the A's, E's, and I's?
>Paul_Holser: ATU J10 UTA +11 219
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALOTUX 2H .OX +28 263
#note Yes, I was concerned about potential row 1 comebacks.  However - I felt that anything he played on row 1 would open up a potential 8 with the blank.  This play wins 89% and wins the sim.  Nothing else comes within 3 points.
>Paul_Holser: CEENOR 1J ENCORE +42 261
>Jim_Burlant: ?AALTTU 3K .AUT +16 279
#note AbUTTAL plays on row 14 for 63 and wins 82%.   I haven't had enough annagramming practice to find 17000-probability words like that in a blank rack with that much duplication.  This is the best non-bingo option and barely sims 5 points down despite giving up 47 points on the scoreboard.  Even with this miss, I should still be in good shape.  He just drew six from this pool; shouldn't he have pulled a bucket full of I's?
>Paul_Holser: AIORSU O3 SOUARI +27 288
>Jim_Burlant: ?AIIILT -II +0 279
#note More anagramming practice needed again - mILITIA!  Not seeing the bingo, I didn't like any of the available dumps; the I was still the highest probability draw in the bag, and I didn't like the idea of heavy turnover because I wanted to minimize my chances of drawing the Q. Quackle doesn't like this, but it sims respectably when compared to the non-bingo options.  Where are the E's?
>Paul_Holser: DEEEINR M11 DIE +17 305
#note Unbeknownst to me, all the E's are in Paul's rack.  Paul told me his rack after the game, and this is where he threw me a lifeline as you're about to see.  F8 NEE is his best play, but that's tough to find.  He gets docked 6 or 7 points in the sim, but this choice costs him the game.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AIILQT 14J QuILT +71 350
#note Finally a play I can find.  N10 QAT sims with higher valuation but this wins more.
>Paul_Holser: EFR N10 FER +25 330
>Jim_Burlant: AGIJNRU 15H RUIN +24 374
#note Tracking was off and I wanted to prevent his hitting something big ending in IS or IN.  This play sims as the silver medalist; I kept the G just in case I needed to play JAG on row 2.
>Paul_Holser: ADEINSW O11 ANISE +46 376
>Jim_Burlant: AGIIJOY C9 JOY +32 406
#note Did the math wrong and thought I lost a couple more points of spread if I played at B1 or 2A.  B1 JOY or JAY is the right play here.
