#note an over-fancy set up.  probably not wise to set up the Z unless i also had an A to go above MA.  Q says just to play ZED at a8 leaving the super strong EMST.

#note got too keen on playing a word i just learned.  didnt find/see n2 BHA(R)AL (twl acceptable) which is best for 41.  c3 BAH is 2nd best in the sim as it has a good leave and scores better than my play.  should have perhaps found BHARAL as i was just talking about that word with my dad this afternoon.
