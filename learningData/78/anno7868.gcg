>Sandeep_Bala: CEKN 8G NECK +20 20
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEGIUW 7F WEB +16 16
#note BEGUI(N)E, BU(N)GEE, U(N)BE, GWI(N)E, (N)EWBIE.  I saw a couple of those, but none seemed very appealing, and this scored more.
>Sandeep_Bala: DEIRT 9C TRIED +15 35
#note ...okay?
>Ryan_Fischer: EGGIIOU D4 GOUGE. +18 34
#note Best, but so ugly!

#note Best and only.
>Sandeep_Bala: EFX L1 F.EX +36 217
>Ryan_Fischer: DIINOTU 1L .IDO +26 214
#note His play at least saves my horrible homeless bingo rack.  (S)TUDIO M2 29... kills too many lines.
>Sandeep_Bala: ??EILMO 6G MOLdIEr +69 286
#note Dammit.  Bagged again.  If I get one of those, I probably win.  The best plays score 78.  Of note, MOhELIm and LIssOME.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEINTUV H11 C.VIE +30 244
#note This over V(A)TIC 'cause I wanted better lanes there.  (L)UV is an option.  Not a good one, but it's there.
>Sandeep_Bala: ANTU 13J TUNA +14 300
>Ryan_Fischer: AINNOTU 1G NU +14 258
#note No MOUNTAIN or FOUNTAIN or LUNATION. :(  I spent a long time on this turn only to conclude that a 2-tile play was best.  If I don't see UN(W)O(N) that is.  Which might be a smidge better considering the Os unseen.
>Sandeep_Bala: AFL K4 AL.F +23 323
>Ryan_Fischer: AHINOOT 10K HO +15 273
#note Best I can do.  Score, keep lanes open, don't give too much back, and pray.
>Sandeep_Bala: ENO 9K ONE +16 339
#note He miraculously doesn't block!
>Ryan_Fischer: AINNOST 15H .NATIONS +77 350
#note SONATINE would win for me with the J in the bag, I think, now that I look at it.  Funny thing is, I didn't even remember it until way after the game.  You always tend to play out in your head the ones you lose after the fact.  But, if he has the J I lose, too.  Oh well.
>Sandeep_Bala: DEIOPPR 8M POD +22 361
>Ryan_Fischer: AHJUY O12 JAY. +22 372
#note Yeah, JAY(S) is best.  Game lost.  Nothing much I could've done about that one.  Some plays early on might have been questionable, but I did the best with what I had most of the time.
