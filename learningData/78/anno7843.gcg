>Jim_Burlant: EEORSTU L4 RESO.UTE +66 66
#note Great start!
>John_Redding: EWY K11 WYE +28 40
#note John told me post-mortem that he was concerned about potential R back-hooks to RESOLUTE.  I agree - a good defensive play on John's part.
>Jim_Burlant: BEFGORT J10 FOB +29 95
#note 13J BEFOG, M11 BEFOG and this choice sim interchangeably; any of them is best.  I considered this play and FOB K3l but felt there wasn't enough defensive advantage at K3 to justify the 3 point sacrifice on the scoreboard.   Didn't see BEFOG and I'm not sure I would have wanted to 
>John_Redding: ?AEINRV 5E REINVAd. +90 130
#note Beautiful play by John.  This is his best bingo and he's winning  59%.  But not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEGRT E5 .EGRATED +70 165
#note Best bingo for me.  Now I'm back at 60%.
>John_Redding: CFRSU 14G CURFS +28 158
>Jim_Burlant: CEIITTU H1 CUTI. +24 189
#note Best, and nothing else comes close.
>John_Redding: MOV H12 OV.M +30 188
>Jim_Burlant: EGIIILT 8A LIGE. +21 210
#note Reluctant to play off the E but felt that the I dumps (12 A TEIID or I 7 INTI)  gave up too much on the scoreboard and/or board position.  The sim is very close - at 1000 iterations, this choice, 8A TIGER, and 12A TEIID are all simming within 0.1 points and 0.4% winning chances of each other.
>John_Redding: AINNSST 3B TANNIS.S +70 258
>John_Redding: AINNSST --  -70 188
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIJTX F5 .X +50 260
#note I didn't give this position enough thought.  All I saw when I wrote his rack down was the 9, STANNITES; I didn't see INSTANTS, so it didn't occur to me that I had anything I needed to block.  The sim says that, against his rack of AINNSST, I definitely should block with JEU and I'm docked 10 points. Even against a random rack, Q says I should play M7 XI for 40 or 10L TAJ for 26.
>John_Redding: AINNSST 6D N..T +13 201
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIJRT 12A JERI. +42 302
#note Great draw!  This is best, nothing even remotely close, and I'm winning 87%.
>John_Redding: AAINOSS A12 .INS +33 234
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGILOT B2 InTAGL.O +74 376
#note Another great draw, and it couldn't have been played better.  Other possible bingos are B1 OBLIGATI, B3 LIGATION, and 1F LOCATING.  The game is over but for the final score.
>John_Redding: ADHSY M8 SHADY +41 275
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEHPR M2 AHED +30 406
#note Whoops, HAED is better due to vowel placement. 11A DRAPE wins the sim.  I didn't see it.
>John_Redding: AKO A1 OKA +28 303
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEIPR C2 PEAR +29 435
#note Whoops - 1J REPAID.  Missed the A front hook.
>John_Redding: EEO C7 O.EE +13 316
>Jim_Burlant: BDIINOP N1 BIO +19 454
#note I was worried he'd hit me with something like ZONAL 2J.
