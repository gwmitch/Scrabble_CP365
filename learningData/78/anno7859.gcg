>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEFOQ 8G OAF +12 12
#note Probably should have exchanged here.  The sim doesn't like this at all...and I get burned on my next turn for it.
>Ken_Kasney: AMX 9E MAX +37 37
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEJOQT 10D QAT +22 34
#note Didn't like this much, and with good reason.  JATO 10D is much safer, but I just wanted to unload the Q.  And short term this worked out.
>Ken_Kasney: DEV 7E DEV +28 65
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGGJOR J2 JOGGERs +89 123
#note Best.  Despite the slow start, I'm winning 65%.
>Ken_Kasney: AMN 6D NAM +24 89
>Jim_Burlant: ADFNRUU D10 .UAD +28 151
#note Or 5A FRAUD.
>Ken_Kasney: GPU 5C PUG +24 113
>Jim_Burlant: FIINRUW 5G FUN.I +18 169
#note Sigh.  Keep the U, so of course I draw the W to go with it even though there are TEN unseen E's.  Anyway - this is best.
>Ken_Kasney: INW 4F WIN +15 128
>Jim_Burlant: EEIRRSW 13B RE.REW +28 197
#note Urp.  RESEW 14B!  This looks good if you don't know my rack, but I should have looked to exploit my S.  This is weak.
>Ken_Kasney: ?ACEHNS B8 CHANc.ES +78 206
#note What we'll never know:  does Ken find ENCHASe if I put down RESEW on the previous turn?
>Jim_Burlant: BIINSVY 2J .IVY +17 214
#note Played this intending to set up the B on the next turn.  This is best, but A14 BI also worth consideration.
>Ken_Kasney: ANPT 11D .NTAP +27 233
#note A word I've never seen...and I don't even hold him.  Shame on me!
>Jim_Burlant: BEHIINS A14 HI +26 240
#note Q says BI is slightly better due to SH synergy.  Perhaps - playing off my H and keeping the B costs me most of the chance I have at this game as you'll see on the next turn.
>Ken_Kasney: CDELOOR 3A DECOLOR +84 317
>Jim_Burlant: BEINOST 1M BOT +22 262
#note Best play is 3M OBI or A1 BOD.  This is a reasonable play but not best.  Of course, if I'd played BI on the previous turn, I'd now have a bingo of ETHIONS for 77 and I'd tie the game back up and probably be winning 35 or 40% instead of the 10% this play wins.
>Ken_Kasney: IK A1 KI. +24 341
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEINS 2D NEB +29 291
#note Not worried about playing the E because there are still 4 unseen.  Q prefers 2E AB instead of this.
>Ken_Kasney: ILO 1A .ILO +13 354
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILSY 8A I.Y +24 315
#note Best.
>Ken_Kasney: OT 4B TO +11 365
>Jim_Burlant: ADEELSS 3M ED +22 337
#note This is the kind of situation where I'm prone to miss a word I should find.  I saw IDEALESS, and having had 3 nogos to this point, frustration and fatigue (this was the eighth game of the day) were setting in.  TASSELED O1 is the play.  While I couldn't have known this at the time, my winning prospects weren't entirely dead.  His next rack is EILORST, and with the remaining pool, if I find TASSELED, I have a 1 in 4 chance of drawing an unblockable out bingo of AZURITE.  
>Ken_Kasney: EILORST 14F LOITERS +70 435
>Jim_Burlant: AELSSTZ 15D ZESTS +87 424
#note Ken's choice of LOITERS (instead of TOILERS) allows me to recoup most of the spread I STEE'd away, but there's nothing else I can do at this point.
>Ken_Kasney: AEEIRU 12H AUREI +17 452
