>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIOOO -AAIOOO +0 0
#note Actual rack.  Seems I'd have a lot of racks like this this tourney.
>Clay_Daniel: EEEFRZ 8H FREEZE +56 56
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??EGIQW 7G QI +26 26
#note N6 QIs 49.  Veddy interesting.  Yeah, totally worth it in hindsight.
>Clay_Daniel: EOO L6 OO.E +13 69
#note Heh, he got my vowels.  I wouldn't be laughing long though!
>Ryan_Fischer: ??EGNNW M7 r.NEWiNG +76 102
#note Only bingo worth playing.  WENdinG hooking OOZE, too.
>Clay_Daniel: KY K7 K.Y +22 91
>Ryan_Fischer: HITTTTU 12I TUTT. +8 110
#note Actual @#%&! rack!  I thought about TI(G)HT but he just (sort of) fished.  TUTT(i) is at least second, but of little consolation.
>Clay_Daniel: AEEHIRV N2 HEAVIER +106 197
#note OW!
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEHIPT O1 PATH +55 165
#note Almost played PHA(G)E.  Then saw PATH.  I think EATH, though 6 less, is even better.  But dammit, no S!  (Hope he doesn't get it...)
>Clay_Daniel: BLOS O8 SLOB +78 275
#note NOOOOO!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIMST M1 TAM +26 191
#note AAH just fell out of my head.  Of note: (KEY)SE(T)
>Clay_Daniel: DINY 14J DIN.Y +28 303
#note Of note: DY(KEY) or DIN(KEY).
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEIJRS 15H JEED +42 233
#note I might have still been in this game had I not played JEED.  42 vs 26 +bingo prone rack?  Hard to say.  Yeah, I think JE(U) might be better at this score.  I figured I had to bingo AND score though, so I needed the extra luck of drawing well to IRS.
>Clay_Daniel: AANSV 1H SAVAN. +30 333
>Ryan_Fischer: GIPRSUW -GUW +0 233
#note This exchange is way down, but I didn't see anything worth scoring, considering the leaves.  2G WIG leaving PRSU is okay, I guess.
>Clay_Daniel: CEU 11G CUE +7 340
>Ryan_Fischer: AIILPRS G9 PI. +10 243
#note Set up another hook, hope for an X-bomb.  6H RIP is what Q recommends.
>Clay_Daniel: GLNO 10F L.NGO +16 356
#note Great, O(LINGO) in play too...
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIILRS 2F GLIA +13 256
#note PICA/GLIA?  I don't see how I bingo then.  6H RIG 14, I guess.
>Clay_Daniel: OX 15N OX +32 388
#note Misscored as 30.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIIMRST K4 MIS... +32 288
#note Best is to dump an I and pray.  L12 (T)I(N) 5.  SIMITAR no go.  I thought MISKEY# was plausible.  Really, can we change already?!
>Clay_Daniel: DIINU 4F INDIU. +11 399
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCIORT -B +0 288
#note Spent the majority of time left trying to figure out how to save spread.  That would've been giving up and scoring, though I couldn't resist trying to get a bingo down.  So I dumped the B trying to fish for EROTICA or a couple other things I saw but now forget.  COBIA, BIOTA, BORIC, all dumb.  Not that this is genius.  Two Os unseen, I should've thrown in the O, too, and maybe the R since there were 3 of those!
>Clay_Daniel: FORSW 13E FROWS +19 418
#note And somehow, miraculously, he blocks my miracle bingo in three places.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIORT E9 ROC +17 305
#note G2 (L)I(N)O 5 has me winning 2.88%?  Haha!
>Clay_Daniel: AAERU 14B AURAE +23 441
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEILOT A12 BILE +33 338
#note OBELI is 3 more.  That's a mistake I'd make, forgetting a hook like that when it didn't matter.  He said the same of OLINGO.
>Clay_Daniel: DR F2 .R.D +6 447
#note L5 D(OOZE)R 21 and out.
>Clay_Daniel:  (OAT) +6 453
