#note Wasn't sure about this, but looks to be best. I also considered M3 SEN 32 but wanted to keep the S and the strong leave with the bottom area open.

#note IN(T)ERIMS 13A. I suck. Saw MINISTER/MISINTER without a problem of course. My play isn't actually that bad, 29% winning pct. compared to 35% for the bingo.

#note M9 SUBERIN 83. Fortunately this doesn't cost me the game as my opponent could then play PAX L12 and still win. Still, this is pretty much inexcusable to miss two high probability bingos like this in one game.
