>Chris_Cree: AAFV 8E FAVA +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: AABDENR 9D DAB +15 15
#note Hmmm.  Quackle doesn't like this at all, preferring F6 BAA. 
>Chris_Cree: ACGHOT 10E GOTCHA +30 50
>Jim_Burlant: AABDENR H10 .RANED +30 45
#note As Yogi Berra would have said, "It's like deja vu all over again."  Quackle likes this a lot more than my last play, though CEDARN is slightly better.
>Chris_Cree: ALPZ 12D PLAZ. +32 82
>Jim_Burlant: ABINRSU 14A URBANIS. +74 119
#note Best.
>Chris_Cree: EHIL 15A HEIL +48 130
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGIOP 13C OE +20 139
#note Best.
>Chris_Cree: JLR J9 J.RL +11 141
>Jim_Burlant: EEGINOP K5 PINGO +25 164
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  PENGO in the same location is better and 11H RERIG wins the sim..  Whatever I put down, however, was going to give Chris the opening he needed. I'm winning 46%...but that's about to go way down.
>Chris_Cree: EEIQSTU L9 EQUITES +94 235
#note Nice play - H1 EQUISETA is even nicer and scores 104.  Either way, I'm in trouble - Chris is winning 80%.
>Jim_Burlant: EELNOUY M7 LEY +29 193
#note Q prefers M6 EELY by a few points.  Maybe better to clear the vowel overload, I dunno.
>Chris_Cree: AKO J5 OKA +39 274
>Jim_Burlant: ENOSTUW L2 UNWET +28 221
#note Best.  Loath to unload the E, but I have to do something to clear out the UW combo.  I'm winning 12%, but that's about to go way up - this play starts a sequence that lets me back into the game.
>Chris_Cree: CIIOOT 3F COITIO. +11 285
#note On the surface, this allows Chris to dump an obviously inert rack and simultaneously kill bingos on any of the lines I opened up.  However, there's one obvious drawback to it as you'll see...
>Jim_Burlant: ?EENOSX 2I EX +52 273
#note Great draw, and I'm back in the game.  The sim and Championship Player are divided here; the sim says I should burn the S for 3 extra points and play SEX so he can't come back on row 1; CP says this play is best by 3 points.  With both blanks in my rack I'd burn the S in a second to prevent row 1 comebacks.  I was intent on S-hooking JOEY with a bingo, so the S remained.
>Chris_Cree: EIMNTU 1D MINUET +36 321
>Jim_Burlant: ?ENORSW N9 SNOWiER +87 360
#note Only knew SWOONED, not SWOONER. SWOONER scores 99.
>Chris_Cree: DIOT 2B DOIT +16 337
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEGRSV B2 .EV +7 367
#note And now I completely hose up the game.  Despite redoing the tracking, I mistracked and thought there was a T out there. Not confident in my word knowledge, I was paranoid about blocking some out bingo he might know that I didn't.  To make matters worse, I completely spaced and forgot that DEV takes an A back hook.  MISGIVE D1 or OVERDOG are the plays here and they win 100%.  In fact, any litany of plays win 100%.  But not this.
>Chris_Cree: AEFIMRY 3A F.Y +28 365
>Jim_Burlant: ?DGRS 5H GR...D +10 377
#note And even here, with the blunder I made on the last turn, I still have the win...but I blow it.  M3 SoD wins.  So do any number of 5B plays like SoRD, SaRD, and SuRD.  I saw SoRD and SuRD but couldn't think of SaRD, which was significant; if I put down SorD or SuRD I thought he could G stick me if he opted to take out I7 with RAN or MAN, and without seeing SARD my priority incorrectly became getting rid of the G.  Forgetting about the A back-hook to DEV made that easy to do...and my face met my palm when he put down the out play I gave him.
