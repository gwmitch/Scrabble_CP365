>John: OPU 8F UPO +10 10
>Matt_: CEKNPRV F7 P.CK +22 22
#note PERV underlappping UPO is best.  PUCK cleans up the rack but gives the juicy A hook back.
>John: ADGO 11D GOAD +25 35
#note Could have been worse.
>Matt_: EEFLNRV D8 VER.E +26 48
#note VENGE instead - LN is worse than LR, and it VERGE gives the R back hook that VENGE doesn't.  Not sure what I was thinking.
>John: IIORT 13B TORII +20 55
#note Again, could have been worse, but I'm bailing him out of his bad racks.
>Matt_: AFILLNZ 14F FALL +28 76
#note Didn't pick FILL because of the Y back hook.  Quackle likes FINAL keeping LZ, but keeping ZIN worked out for me.
>John: ADU H12 AU.D +18 73
>Matt_: AEEINNZ B10 ZEA.IN +70 146
#note Luckbox.
>John: AEGINRW I3 WEARING +74 147
#note And after his pruning he gets his bingo down.
>Matt_: EEGIMNV 4H V.NGE +26 172
#note Didn't even think to look parallel of WEARING - This word at J2 scores 33.  I liked that it was hard to hit the triple after my play.
>John: BIY 15A I.BY +39 186
#note Ouch: not much I could do there though.
>Matt_: EEEIMOS J2 MO.IE +26 198
#note Took awhile to find this, but happy I did.  It scores well and clears some of this ugly vowelitis.
>John: AHTU G3 HAUT +21 207
>Matt_: ?EEIOSS M2 EOSInES +75 273
#note (D)IOcESES scores 79, but EOSInES is thte best of the 7's.
>John: JO F2 JO +30 237
#note And there goes that half of the board.
>Matt_: CDIMRTU L7 DICTUM +30 303
#note Pretty straightforward, clear the junk and score, making it much more difficult to bingo down column N.
>John: DNW 2L W.ND +16 253
#note Opens up lane O...leaving me with a dilemma.
>Matt_: BENORRX K10 EXON +46 349
#note I can either take the 46 from EXON and leave column O alone, or block with DEX or DORR.  Quackle suggests to take the points.  When I laid this down John said "Ouch..."
>John: AEEFLRT O2 .EFLATER +98 351
#note ...but then said "I really shouldn't say ouch considering what I'm about to do" and played this.  Now we're all square again going into the pre-endgame.
>Matt_: BIORRST 10J B.. +11 360
#note I really didn't know what to do here.  I didn't want to empty the bag, especially with the Q and a blank still unseen.  I didn't like plays along row 14 because he could hit me back with an H play for 40-50.  So I decided to gather more information by just playing off the B.  Quackle hates this of course, suggesting GRIOT K4 or any number of plays down column E, but it confused John, which may have worked to my benefit.
>John: Q 14A Q. +22 373
#note Well the Q's accounted for at least.
>Matt_: IORRSTY 15H .ORTY +15 375
#note I really liked this play.  Again, I didn't like plays along row 14, so I decided to take out that threat altogether.  What I didn't think of was that if John has the blank, he's very likely to bingo down column N.  OY N9 at least takes that out of the picture, but I don't know how I manage a win in the endgame after that, as he'll hit the EXON hook and I've run out of places to score, unless I draw the H.  I got lucky though.
>John: AAEHLNS N7 ELANS +18 391
#note So it turns out that John has 3 winning plays; SHE M12, AAHS 14L, and LEASH N8.  He has to block my outplay, or hope I don't see it (which I almost missed).
>Matt_: ?IRST 13J I.SeRT +22 397
#note Or INSTaR.  I almost missed it, and was unsure of DICTUMS, but figured it was my only chance to win. John of course challenged, but figured it was good as we walked up. Quite the thrilling win, and definitely the highlight result of the tournament for me.
>Matt_:  (HA) +10 407
