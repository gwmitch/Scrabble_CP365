#note For some reason, I can never think of any of the anagrams for SCARLET.  Now I won't forget them, even though I didn't get burned too badly here.

#note BUSY was the other option.  AEM is in fact worth 9 more points than EU.  It's amazing how poor U's are in general.

#note I wanted to play BEWIG, but that seemed like too easy a lane to give him after an exchange.
