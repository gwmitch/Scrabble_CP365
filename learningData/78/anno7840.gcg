>Wes_Eddings: EEEQTUY -EEEQ +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADFIKO 8G KIF +20 20
#note The leave is a little vowel heavy for Quackle's tastes.  Q prefers 8H KAIF.
>Wes_Eddings: ADEW 9F WADE +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADIOTU 7B AUDITOr +70 90
#note The only playable bingo.

>Jim_Burlant: ELMOORV D1 VROOME. +34 124
#note Best.  Play was held, but accepted.

>Wes_Eddings: ?AEENSU --  -140 53
#note Having reviewed my top 3k 8's prior to the tournament paid off here.  This word has the same mathematical probability as UNIVERSE, which I'd encountered in my study.  I knew I hadn't seen this, so I was 100% sure this was no good.
>Jim_Burlant: CDILNRV 2B VI.L +14 138
#note Fail.  3C CORVID is much better than this.  Or, for that matter, 3C COVIN.  Couldn't think of any of the good choices here.
>Wes_Eddings: ?AEENSU 10A AvENUES +73 126
>Jim_Burlant: CDNPRRY J9 DRY +19 157
#note Another poor play.  Quackle found a really cool play here that most humans wouldn't find:  PYR(I)C E4 44.  However, for plays most humans would find, E10  UPDRY or RYND at J9 or 10I are much better choices than this.
>Wes_Eddings: AINNOTU 5D .OUNTAIN +90 216
>Jim_Burlant: CEGINPR H1 CREP. +36 193
#note Best, but I'm only winning 27%.
>Wes_Eddings: IQ 4J QI +24 240
#note Dangerous choice by Wes, espeically with SSS unseen.
>Jim_Burlant: BEGINRT A10 .RGENT +27 220
#note This wasn't one of the original Quackle kibitzer choices, and it doesn't sim well either.  Championship Player's preference is 3K BIG, and the sim prefers a bunch of fishing plays (like B6 BAA) to unload the B.  Pfft.    While BIG leaves a beautiful ENRT, I felt that any fish or small rack-groomer would result in a no-go if I didn't draw an S.  While BI wasn't a leave to get excited about,  I felt - and still feel - 27 points plus 5 tiles turned was the better choice given this board and pool.
>Wes_Eddings: FOT 3C F.OT +26 266
>Jim_Burlant: BEIOORS L1 BOOS +42 262
#note Best.  While a little vowel heavy, EIR isn't exactly a bad starting point for building a rack and I do score 42.  This gets me back up to 33%.
>Wes_Eddings: GIJNO 11H JO.ING +34 300
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIIRT L8 DAI.TIER +74 336
#note Was wondering what I was going to do with this until he floated the N.  This is the only playable bingo and it wins 64%.  Back in the driver's seat.  Also - Wes was under 1 minute by now.
>Wes_Eddings: EEHLR 14J HE.LER +34 334
#note Wasn't entirely sure this was good (it is), but given my rack there was no reason to challenge unless I was 100% sure.
>Jim_Burlant: ALMSWXY O12 WA.Y +42 378
#note Sim prefers O11 SWARM in the same location by 4 pts.  SWARM wins 72%, this play wins 70.
>Wes_Eddings: EINZ 15G ZINE +44 378
>Jim_Burlant: ACELMSX M7 LEX +39 417
#note Quackle prefers E5 OXIM by a bunch.  This play sims with much higher valuation but wins 10% less apparently.  Wes was about to go over on time, which also made the extra points that much more valuable.
>Wes_Eddings: AEGHSTU 1L .ATH +27 405
#note 13H TUSHIE is Wes's best play.
>Jim_Burlant: ACLMS 13F CLAMS +19 436
#note Or CALMS in the same location.  Wes went 50 seconds over on time.  Final score recorded as 446 - 395.
>Jim_Burlant:  (EGSU) +10 446
