>Ryan_Fischer: CDIIJOY 8H IDIOCY +30 30
#note Correct.  Q static says play it for 32.  The sim likes it for 30 just fine.
>Vince_Castellano: EFNORTU 9C FORTUNE +72 72
#note L8 (C)ONFUTER 78?

#note 8A ENEMA 44?

>Ryan_Fischer: ?BBNOVW M2 BOW +21 242
#note I seriously contemplated B(I)B, but saw a scenario where he bingos off of it and the boad goes dead and I'm sunk.  That's why I chose BOW (not VOW).
>Vince_Castellano: EHM 4D HEM +46 315
#note Dammit.  This is the place where it feels I just got outdrawn.  Sure, ENEMA was questionable as was EMENDER over REEDMEN, but I can't keep up with his fortune (yay puns) when the differences are marginal at best.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABENTU 7K N.B +20 262
#note Pretty far down.  Thought it'd be okay 'cause of the Q.  Sim says... oh look!  It jumps to second or third!
>Vince_Castellano: AST A12 .ATS +39 354

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEILOT 14H ELATIOn +68 376
#note Well, I didn't play ALOETIc 'cause I think if I draw well I can throw down another bingo.  He doesn't have the S, yet, or he probably wouldn't be as scared of the OE hook.  kEITLOA for 69 is 1 point more, keeps another line open.

#note 13J KAON 30?  This one is just a bit more flashy.
