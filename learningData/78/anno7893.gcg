#note Well, this looks familiar.  Thank goodness I blocked the 114 point placement!

#note JIN may actually be better here, with most of the N's no longer in play.

#note This was the 9th time in the tournament that I played a bingo after drawing seven tiles.  That felt like a lot, but Jerry Lerman did that 7 times in one game alone!

#note As unpromising as this rack looked, it meant that he had all the consonants.  One more vowel in the pool would have made this endgame rather dicey.

#note Not one of my better tournaments, but there were plenty of exciting games.  Just not quite enough breaks went my way, coupled with some costly mistakes on my part.
