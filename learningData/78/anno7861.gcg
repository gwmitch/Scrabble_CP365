>Orry_Swift: BDEENOR 8H ENROBED +76 76
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIII K8 .IDIA +12 12
#note I felt that AEI and 4 tiles turned were enough to justify playing through, especially taking the slightly vowel-discounted bag into consideration.  Either this or exchanging AIII is best.
>Orry_Swift: LMOY L12 MOLY +34 110
>Jim_Burlant: AEIJLTZ J12 TAJ +31 43
#note Not that I was surprised that this spot disappeared, but JEZ(A)IL for 60 would have been nice.  No matter - this is best.  
>Orry_Swift: AENTUV N2 VAUNTE. +26 136
>Jim_Burlant: EIILRTZ 10K .ITZ +34 77
#note Best, and nothing else is worth consideration.  I'm still in a bad spot; though I've made the best play on my first 3 turns I'm still only winning 16%.
>Orry_Swift: AAU J6 AU.A +8 144
>Jim_Burlant: EILOPRT 3H PETIOL.R +72 149
#note I saw 5D POITREL for 73 but I just didn't like the board; if I didn't draw an S it looked like the kind of spot that could potentially screw me in an end game.  While this did potentially serve up huge comebacks, they were likely to occur sooner than later and I could have more chance to recover from them.   PETIOLAR only scored one less and I felt it was worth the risk.  Quackle mildly disagrees, preferring POITREL by roughly 1-1/2 points.  Maybe Quackle is right, and maybe it's not.  But what's certain is that, if I played POITREL, it would have spared me from the blunder I was about to make on the next turn.
>Orry_Swift: AIORSTY 7B OSTIARY +67 211
>Jim_Burlant: ?CCEENS E5 SC.ENCE +44 193
#note The first bingo I saw was CONCEDES B6, and I didn't like the board position.  Seeing the open 2x2 down the E column, I felt that something scoring in the 40s and keeping the blank would work.  Of course, if I play POITREL on the previous turn I simply play CADENCES or CONCEDES for high 60's and don't blunder.  When I made this play and hit my clock, I didn't recognize that I had missed SCIENCEs.  However...
>Orry_Swift: GNPSU 12A PUNGS +34 245
#note ...the instant I watched Orry hook his S, I looked at my rack, saw my last play had left the blank, and realized just how badly I had blundered.  <<face palm>>  What's worse is that I wasn't through screwing up just yet.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABFHNR 6E .HAR +38 231
#note I didn't like the leave, but I felt that this was just too many points to pass up, especially in light of my blunder on the last turn.  Quackle prefers L2 FOB, L2 FORB and M7 HEFT.
>Orry_Swift: ERX A12 .REX +39 284
>Jim_Burlant: ?BFGINQ 8A QI +35 266
#note Every play should be so easy/obvious.  This is best, winning 32%.
>Orry_Swift: IK 6B KI +35 319
>Jim_Burlant: ?BFGNRT L2 F.B +16 282
#note Quackle prefers K column plays like GRIFT/RIFT, or L1 FRONT/FROG, and I'm docked 5 points for this choice by Championship Player.  I didn't want to break up much of this rack and I figured I was probably going to land something like EO, OO, or EI.  That's not quite what happened, but this did work out.
>Orry_Swift: LOW 15L .OWL +30 349
>Jim_Burlant: ?GINRTU 14A .RUcTING +70 352
#note Or ERUPTING, and both bingos win 31%.  This was held, but released.  
>Orry_Swift: AEMO H11 OME.A +33 382
>Jim_Burlant: ADDHISV 7L AH.D +25 377
#note This is best in the 4-ply sim; I was trying to prevent the possibility of his coming back with WEFT to clinch the game.  I'm winning 43%.
>Orry_Swift: EEEFL 10A FLEE.E +15 397
>Jim_Burlant: DEGIOSV D1 VOGIE +28 405
#note OGIVES A1 wins; everything else loses.  How do I miss that? Really a shame that, outside of forgetting to tack the blank on to SCIENCEs, I had to blunder away an otherwise well played game with a complete lack of focus when it really counted.
