#note i have too much of an irrational fear of a closed board against trip or other defensively minded players, so even though i recognize TUSH is the best play here, i couldn't bring myself to play it. i must be nuts. (-13)
>payne: AEMNNOU 9A NOUMENA +67 87
#note i guess i don't have to worry about a closed board now
>cesar: ACDERSZ B8 C.Z +34 68
#note i should penalize myself anyway for not even seeing ZANDER but i suppose COZ has a very strong chance of bingoing next turn. 
>payne: IIIII -IIIII +0 87
#note your law has often saved me, lester.
>cesar: ADEIRSY 11B YAIRD +36 104
#note well of course i should play just COZY. i have a 92% chance of bingoing next turn (!?) (-6)

#note i did not feel sufficiently brave to play 14I OF, although i wanted to play it so badly. there's almost no chance he won't go there next turn and it could be for a lot. *shrug*.

>cesar: AAEFIST 14J FA +28 308
#note ok now i was surprised that FA doesn't go straight to the top. i overestimated AEIST plus thats the only lane and he could go right. K11 AAL and 12C IF seem like safer choices. (-1)

>cesar: AEGISTY 15F GAYEST +39 347
#note STAGEY is better, missed it. 15K YAGI is actually best though! it basically guarantees the win! (-4)

#note TWIER 11K leaves one in the bag and lessens risk of duplication of Ts. interesting. (-5)
