#note ? i didn't see a few options here like 3I PAH, or 13C GLYPH/PHYLA which are both much better than my play. i'm not sure this is a complete blunder, but it certainly is not a very good move. i don't normally play crap like this unless it feels absolutely necessary, but he has a random rack from an OK pool; i should be able to find GLYPH.

#note ? this is a bad move because 12.5% of the time he will bingo out with LURDaNS which i didn't see. it doesn't lose the game but i completely missed it; A1 WIGAN is the play. i had about 2 minutes on my clock and wrote down all his possible racks and tried to find a bingo that fit thru the G and only saw GRUNTLES/GRUNTLED (missed GOLDURNS); this seemed to win 100% but not enough time to check or look for wigan.
