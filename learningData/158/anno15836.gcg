#note If you imply a good rack for Chris (ERS or INS), this sims rather well.

>Eric_Tran: ADELNOW 7F DOW +20 20
#note i7 WOE is really good defense.  Didn't see it.  Quack also likes 7G OWN.  Keeping the D here is really good.
>Chris_Cree: DEIPRST 10H STRIPED +73 94
>Eric_Tran: ADELMNX 11K DEX +41 61
#note better than AXEMEN.
>Chris_Cree: IIIII -IIIII +0 94
>Eric_Tran: AJLMNST L8 JA..S +44 105
#note Nothing wrong with 6H TAJ.  too hasty.  JAPES gives away so many easy pts, so it's not worth burning the S.
>Chris_Cree: AEN 8L .EAN +33 127
>Eric_Tran: IILMNST M7 T.L.. +17 122
#note Only saw EXIT until after I hit my clock.  also missed M(ID)I which keeps a great leave.

>Eric_Tran: AENNORV 4K .ANEV +26 323
#note Took a lot of time on this play.  VINO/VINA eliminate the best hotspot, and keep a very reasonable leave, and keeps EN(DOW) for next turn.  Wrong choice.
>Chris_Cree: AEHT A12 HAET +45 325
#note That hurts
>Eric_Tran: EHLNORR E11 HONER +31 354
#note 2 ply prefers HORN.  With all the Y's unseen, I thought HONER would be safer.  HERON, of course, would be a better alternative to HONER.

#note Getting low on time.  --The only game all tournament where I was time-pressured.  Guess it was nerves.  I should find G(OF)ER here.

#note Low on time.  If I'm going to empty the bag, C8 plays are best.  Else, C12 EL.
