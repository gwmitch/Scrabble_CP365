#note JD: I convinced myself that workup was not a word.
>Eric_Tran: EEEHMRY F10 HM +32 108
#note Leave is awful, but this play is full of so much defense, it jumps to the top of 2ply sim.
>Jesse_Day: AAEERUX 9B AXE. +25 51
#note JD: ugh, this play is kind of awful but what else can I do? Eric is a very defensive player with great board control, and if I don't work to open the board he will surely just close on the right as soon as possible. the only competitor quackle comes up with is AUK at 12C which will allow me to play my X next turn assuming he blocks on the right.
>Eric_Tran: ABEEERY A4 EYEBAR +49 157
>Jesse_Day: AADERUV 4A .AVE +14 65
#note JD: I spent many minutes on this play. again, I somehow have to keep the board dynamic. AUK at 12C is much better in raw valuation, I was worried about him closing the right, and he most likely will, but at least AUK leaves a chance of playing at B2-B6 next turn for some much-needed points.

#note ET: There are no standout plays here.  So, I should focus more on board shape (and leave).  I wanted to parallel the -AGE part, to stop him from hitting a perpendicular bingo that would completely open the board.  Quackle can't really adjust for that.  That said, ADELT is a really strong leave, so playing off DO somewhere is often preferred by quackle.  It also really likes E3 ODD, keeping AELT.

#note ET: Another board killing play
>Jesse_Day: ACENOPU -  +0 192
#note JD: unfortunately, I was pretty sure this was phony and challenged very quickly. awful tournament for words. OUNCE gives me at least a chance.
>Eric_Tran: EIINORW H1 WI. +18 316
#note ET: I'm up 100.  A little worried about ZA 2F; My play then sets up ZE(I)N, so it's not a great block.  This forces him to find bingoes through the W, which I can hopefully block in future turns.  (T)WI(N) gives him bingo opportunitis at 2I which fork the board.
>Jesse_Day: ACENOPU M9 OUNCE +27 219
>Eric_Tran: EEIJNOR 1F JE. +13 329
#note ET: Another tough rack.  I play this off to block W bingoes and ZEIN.  Keeps a flexible bingoable leave.  Sim likes 14A/B JOIN or JIN, which look awful to me.  (A)JEE also looks bad, as it lets him score big and open another lane.  
>Jesse_Day: AEIOPRR 14A POI +21 240
#note JD: frustrating to see the last move go down, I suppose W- bingoes could've been high-scoring from his perspective
>Eric_Tran: EINORSZ A12 ZI.S +75 404
#note ET: Had to eschew my 95 pt bingo.  Jesse asked me why I was hemming so much over my 75 pt play, and inferred I had the blank.
