#note Dave is very likely to block the spot I am trying to set up.  But thought it was worth a try.  Wasn't 100% on PIQUING, the star play.  I think this play is still better than QU(O)IN though, since WIPING has the potential for a big score next turn.
>Dave_Wiegand: FFINO 12G .ONIFF +28 46
>Eric_Tran: ?AGQRUY 10B QUAGm.RY +90 109
#note I actually have another playable bingo here: QUARRYING!  Dave sadly blocks my 72 Q spot, so I have to settle for bingoing for 90 pts.

>Dave_Wiegand: AIJO 5C JIAO +39 120
>Eric_Tran: ?AALMPS 5H iMPALAS +71 260
#note Sim likes M5 PLASMAS.  It has the added benefit of blocking bingoes on 7 or 9, which I didn't consider.
>Dave_Wiegand: OUZ H12 .UZO +39 159
>Eric_Tran: EEENNTY 4L EYEN +27 287
#note Despite my 3 bingoes, I'm only up 100.  I should really cash ENJOY here.  I wanted to muck up the bingo lines, but ENJOY is just so many pts.  EYEN also has pretty poor defense, and still lets -ER bingoes play.
>Dave_Wiegand: AMV D2 MAV.. +20 179
>Eric_Tran: ADENNTT D10 .TTEND +18 305
#note I thought this play would be useful for blocking some bingoes on 14 and 15.  Also gets turnover and gets to the endgame quicker.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADITX 2B AD.IXT +64 243
>Eric_Tran: AEEELNO 1E LEAN +25 330
#note EEL to keep a consonant must be better.
>Dave_Wiegand: EHH 4F HEH +28 271
>Eric_Tran: EEELNOR 14F RE.ONE +19 349
#note blocking the last of the 8 letter bingo lines.  still worried as heck Dave will find something through EL or EL though.  Given the pool, it's unlikely Dave can make a big score to the x3 here.
>Dave_Wiegand: EISVW 15K SWIVE +47 318
#note Crap
>Eric_Tran: ACELLTU B10 .UELL +28 377
#note I stared at the pool and couldn't find any bingoes ending in E.  --turns out there weren't any.  At this point, I'm at risk of getting outrun.  Champ says this wins the most..  I was very hesitant to make this play and wanted to block possible nines.

#note I'm still paranoid about 9s.  RUD(ES)T sims best.
