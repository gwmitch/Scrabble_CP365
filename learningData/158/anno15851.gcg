#note Best - for reference, HAZIER F8 scores the same but wins more than 2% less often and sims more than 5 points down at not even 300 iterations.
>Mike_Early: ?ADEEGT 7H lEGATED +67 87
#note This scores 67; his best bingos are 10D GAZETTED for 70 with different placements of the blank.  
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFLOR K1 FREELO.D +74 112
#note Find a good play, look for a better one.  N2 REFOLDED scores 80 and doesn't slot the triple.  
>Mike_Early: AMN E11 MAN +18 105
>Jim_Burlant: CIJLRTW 4J J.W +26 138
#note Statically this does very poorly but the sim is another story; while this doesn't win, the sim makes clear this is an upper-echelon choice. Best per the duck is 1H CLIFT.  It's counterintuitive to keep J and W, but I there's a lot to be said for that choice in that it takes out row 1, and the JW combination has multiple places to play on the next turn  (here, and at 9E for the same points - someting I failed to consider at the time).  And, if I play JEW on row 9, row 1 probably gets taken out and I have the E's to bingo through - not the case with this choice.  While my play isn't bad, it's definitely not best.
>Mike_Early: ?EINOOR 14B EROsION +71 176
#note Maybe the duck was onto something about taking out row 1 - ROOFLINE 1H scores 140!
>Jim_Burlant: CIILRTY H12 TI.Y +24 162
#note Not knowing CITIFY, I got paranoid about taking out 15H, probably because I overestimated the threat that Mike would have something like AXONE H11.  Row 1 should have been the play.  CITIFY if I know it, FITLY otherwise.  This is pathetic.
>Mike_Early: DERW 15A DREW +49 225
#note Despite my mistakes, I was in it until now. But this is where things started to slip away.  Mike's next several racks are obviously crap-laden...but every crap-laden rack he had fits the board for huge points and I wasn't able to keep up.
>Jim_Burlant: CILORTV 12A VIOL. +24 186
#note Tough spot.  I have a lot of options that score reasonably well, but the problem is that they completely strangle the northeast; if I play there with CROFT 1H or CORVID 2I (the latter of which I didn't know) Mike could be one play away from rendering the southeast impassable and leaving me nowhere to come back.  The sim likes CROFT microscopically better than CORVID 2I.   I really wanted to keep things alive and unload the V while I was doing it.  I don't really like my play, either...but CORVID or CROFT just seem to guarantee that I lose by less but leave me very little chance of winning.

>Jim_Burlant: AACERTU 1H CRA.T +33 219
#note If you don't know the 8, ARCATURE (I've studied to 6500, and this is in the 12000 range) your best play is to apparently fish with 3K EAU.  Sad but true:  I never saw FEUAR.  This sucks. The bingo wins 29 - 30%; this wins less than 10.  And my next draw doesn't help, either.
>Mike_Early: ACGNSTU 2J G.ANT +29 289
#note His rack - this is clearly best.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEERUU -EEUU +0 219
#note Yuck.  Exchanging is definitely the right call.
>Mike_Early: CIOX 12H .OXIC +28 317
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNRS E5 LEA +9 228
#note With ETERNALS/TELERANS blocked, what to do?  Q says I should just play LEA 11A for 21; I thought it might be good to open up the northwest.  
>Mike_Early: BE 5C BE. +5 322
>Jim_Burlant: EKMNRSS K11 M.KE +20 248
#note I thought I'd set myself up to score on row 15; that said, what the hell was I thinking?  MINK or MIRK is an awful lot better than this.  This is stupid, as I leave myself without vowels.

#note Yes, I'm a dumb%$@.  CANTS H1 scores 17 and saves 11 points of spread.  Final score recorded as 375 - 426.  Certainly not a good way to start the tournament.  While a lot of my play left an awful lot to be desired, the reality is that, by the time I missed the bingo, this game was done.  Turns 4, 6, and 9 were just awful; admittedly, 4 and 6 were poor in no small part due to inadequate word knowledge, though I didn't get burned for the turn 9 mistake.  Only thing keeping it closer than the blowout that it was was that Mike played cheap defense late, allowing me to close some spread.  Even there, I should have closed 11 more points in the end game.
