#note i'm usually one to take the points, so i don't know why i didn't consider HEAPY or YEH that much. the leaves just seemed so ugly, but YEH is 35 points. it's still pretty close. (-2)
>jeremy: AAWY H12 AWAY +36 116
>cesar: AABEEHK L4 BAH +31 131
#note J12 HAKE is the best move. should see that. (-2)

#note i think i just missed the ASK hook both times since AKENE looks best here; but i should have also looked a little harder for 9F KENTE. i was not on my game here. ALKENE N9 is another kind of crazy choice, maybe. I don't know what to infer from JO but I was a little worried. (-4)
>jeremy: CHIORST 14G H.RICOTS +80 223
#note i've basically lost this game.
>cesar: EEEEINO -EEEIO +0 150
#note i shouldn't bother keeping the N; i get another shot at the blank and there are 4 Ns out.  quackle likes keeping EIN best though for some reason. (-1.5)
>jeremy: DFU 11K FUD +24 247
>cesar: BEENNTV 11D VENT +16 166
#note also for some reason quackle likes 12L NEVE a bit more. it's more volatile, i guess. (-2)
>jeremy: ?ADEFMN E5 ENFrAM.D +76 323
#note blah, how did i screw this up so badly. AKENE would have only let him OSTRICH which i might have been able to bounce back on.. although not if i draw 4 vowels.

#note i think quackle is wrong with all of the V fishes it likes. my chances of winning this game are extremely low and toad probably doesn't do much to help that; my hope was just that he had some sort of ugly rack and that he couldn't hit the D or something, but where else is he going to play? if i get the X i have a tiny shot. open to suggestions here. i almost plaed TOADIE* D2 before i came to my senses.
>jeremy: EGLOV O7 GLOVE. +33 394
#note too much to hope for i guess
>cesar: ADEEILX B9 EX +52 308
>jeremy: EGGL A6 GLEG +22 416
>cesar: ADEIILO F3 OIL +5 313
#note i don't know what i'm even going for here, probably a bad play for spread purposes. there's no way i'm going to win the game, so i should cut my losses with VOID or something like that.

#note sheesh
>cesar: ADEINNZ 1A ZINE +44 357
#note lame miss of DIZEN, but i was probably really low on time like always. (-12)
