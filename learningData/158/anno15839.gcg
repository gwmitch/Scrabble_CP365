#note Sim likes HALVA.  DN is so much better than NV, I should have given it more thought.  I'm not convinced it's 10 pts better, as quackle 2 ply suggests.

#note Wanting to keep the Z for 9M.  Better than N(E)TTY to prefer ER bingoes at D.

#note Took forever on this play, and still didn't get it right.  Missed R(E)HAB; and BORA/HORA 4L mess with the ACIERATE hooks.
>Chris_Cree: EY 2L .EY +30 212
>Eric_Tran: ACEIOOR B3 OORIE +12 262
#note His last play suggests he's close to bingoing.  Really like how this kills all the lines.  The 1M line counters the O line, so I should be in good shape to match Chris for scoring.
>Chris_Cree: IP C3 PI +18 230
>Eric_Tran: AACFPTU 1M PAC +32 294
#note Didn't see O4 ACUATE.  keeping high scoring tiles won't hurt me so much.  Sim also prefers FAT.
>Chris_Cree: MOU O6 MOU. +18 248
>Eric_Tran: AEFNTUW A1 FEW +35 329
#note I hated opening up a new bingo line, after being so careful to close them.  2ply really likes this move -- 3 win% and 12 pts better than the next plays.  4ply likes it by 1.5 win% and 6 pts.  Tough call.  I kind of like C6 TWA now.
>Chris_Cree: ?AEINOS 1A .ArINOSE +83 331
>Eric_Tran: ABGNSTU H12 .UG +7 336
#note Sim is unreliable here, as Chris should always be blocking my setup.  I love that this is very hard to block, and leaves 3 in the bag.
>Chris_Cree: DO I14 OD +6 337
>Eric_Tran: ABNRSTW 2D NAW +31 367
#note Sim likes C6 TWA, to block his L plays at D4.  B(R)AWN > TAW > NAW and B(R)AWN still all win 100%, according to duck.
