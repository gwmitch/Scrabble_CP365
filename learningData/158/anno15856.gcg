>Jim_Burlant: AEEHNOR 8G HOE +12 12
#note A bit of a surprise - Q wants me to blow this apart with 8D HEREON for 26.  I'd rather keep AENR together.  Agree with me or not, this did work out.
>Fran_Silver: GUV 7F VUG +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNRS J2 LEANERS +68 80
#note This also scores 66 at J3.  While this gives the triple line up,l if I play at J3, a 5-letter C word could be just as bad, if not even worse, that giving up the triple.  Q agrees with me - the board position makes the point trade-off irrelevant.  This is best.
>Fran_Silver: ILOTX 4G OXT.IL +42 59
>Jim_Burlant: AGOORSZ M1 GROSZ +44 124
#note If you don't know my rack, this looks like a strong play.  The reality?  I suck.  I saw the C front hook to LEANERS and the G front hook never registered with me.  GAZOOS 1J scores  87 - this is pathetic.
>Fran_Silver: EPR H1 PRE. +39 98
>Jim_Burlant: AADIKOP 5C OKAPI +24 148
#note Either this or PAGOD 1K.  I never thought of PAGOD as I got a mental block about getting rid of the K.
>Fran_Silver: ENW 6L NEW +30 128
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADFIRW C3 FR.W +20 168
#note Either this or D2 DAWK.  I'd rather unload the F.  
>Fran_Silver: CERTU O4 CUTER +37 165
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADDHII 1M .ID +15 183
#note  I'd rather unload the duplicated D than take 21 for GHI.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Fran_Silver: AJ 2F JA. +26 191
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEHII 2J .AI.D +18 201
#note Or LIARD in the same location.
>Fran_Silver: ANO E2 ANO. +15 206
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEHITY N6 .YE +16 217
#note Sets up my H for a hopefully easy 7 down the M column and balances the rack nicely.  Q agrees - this is best.  75% to win, even despite my turn 2 misfire.
>Fran_Silver: BILS 9K LIBS +19 225
>Jim_Burlant: ?EHIOTT 10G gOTHITE +75 292
#note Best bingo - THOrITE scores 67.  And there was a side benefit to this:
>Fran_Silver: EINOTUU -  +0 225
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDFMOT 11H MOAT +29 321
#note Scores well, but I should have played K1 MAFIA.  I didn't look hard enough to find it.  Still 94% to win.
>Fran_Silver: DEIQU 12K EQUID +38 263
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCDFNT -BDFN +0 321
#note I saw N11 FIND but didn't like it - with the S out, I didn't want to give up a bingo on row 15, and the pool looked bingo prone enough for me to play cautiously here.  Q says that if I pass up FIND, the next 10 choices are exchanges.

>Jim_Burlant: EFMN 15G MEN +27 452
#note Not at all well played on my end - late-day fatigue definitely setting in.  With tiles this good, I didn't have to play well.
