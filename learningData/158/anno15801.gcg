#note Having the E blocked was annoying, but not surprising. DAP sims ahead of TIAR(AE)D despite the extra score there.

#note A couple of sixes fare slightly better - CINEOL 1G for 37 (yes, should have spotted that) and COIGNE. COGIE is a trace behind, beating on sim the intriguing HOC and HO/ZO both at 3M.
