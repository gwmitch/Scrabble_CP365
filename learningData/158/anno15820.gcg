>Joshua_Sokol: AEJLMMT 8G J.T +10 38
#note Not quite sure what the best play here is. I think this is fine.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EEL J8 EEL +16 28
>Joshua_Sokol: AELMMOR 9F MO +15 53
#note So I looked at the W and hoped MEALWORM or WORMMEAL were words. MEALWORM is good. Cool. I guess there are so many WORM words that I should have tried that one. MALER is not much better than ALER so I should have just played MOM somewhere.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AFNW 10E FAWN +31 59
#note :(
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILMR 11D MARL +41 94
#note I forgot about RAMILIE being good. Damn. This was really really bad. LIMIER, MAILER and EARL are quite better in the same spot.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BEOY 12D OBEY +58 117
#note I pay the price!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHIIOT I4 OI +9 103
#note I'm pretty sure this is better than K9 HIE.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?GNOPTU 3I POUTiNG +82 199
#note Damn. I was hoping his last tile was an E for POUTINE, so I could 3x3.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEHIST O3 .lITCHES +89 192
#note I spent a while here and couldn't find anything better. This was the highest scoring bingo, and probably the one that cuts down my opponent's score the most
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EFIQU K9 FIQUE +41 240
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILPRV J1 AV. +14 206
#note I hated that there was nowhere to put PREVAIL. I should probably just play it through K13 though.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AGHIN L1 HA.ING +28 268
#note (A)AHING.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILPRR D11 ..R +5 211
#note PAREIR(A) I guess. or (H)ARP.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ENSY H12 SYNE +35 303
#note SNYE is probably just a bit safer.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILPR 11K .I +11 222
#note Didn't like any of my options, and time seemed to be running out.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: RTU 1L .URT +21 324
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILPRZ 1H PI. +15 237
#note PLAZA. Now I'm just playing stupid, hoping to draw TI for LATERIZ(E) or something.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AINRV N10 INVAR +24 348
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDELRZ M13 ZA +46 283
#note ZED is better.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: OOX J13 OXO +28 376
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDEKLR 14B DREAD +28 311
#note DRAKE?
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ABE 13A BEA. +19 395
>Joshua_Sokol: EEKLLOT 6J LO.E +7 318
#note This doesn't give me a win. 15C EL does. My time was running out.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADEIINR 2B DENARII +74 469
#note I drew both S's :P
