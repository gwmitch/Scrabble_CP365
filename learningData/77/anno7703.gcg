SCUBA's another possibility. I still like my play, though.

Ooh, didn't see the big underlap JE(R)EED G3 (MAE/TOE/ORE/NED#).

#note That fit well. Briefly thought about just ECHED so as not to open the B column, but that's ridiculous.

#note 
Lots of possibilities here. Mine barely wins out in the short sim I did...saw SHADY, HANDY L11, HYNDE# or HYED#, HAYED. Felt the E would be good to keep and HANDY L9 seemed safer than the other choices.

#note 
That blank bingo would have about killed me in TWL, but thanks to this play I'm still about even money to win. Both Q and Z still out...big QI spot but only one I (and no U's)...

#note 
Ye gods. Quackle seems to like Z(I)N H4, emptying the bag and taking out the Q spot. Think I've got to block QI, but I was thinking I'd need the Z to score more than 22 with (at B6, say). Is ZIN going for bingos in two spots, B column and G or H column? Not sure I see where too many draws give me that. Will have to think more on this one.

Ouch, had the win here and fumbled it: 9G ORS 23, (Quackle plays BA A14 27), B6 ZINE or ZEIN 35. If I play ZINE first, Quackle plays QA(T), I play ORS 8A and it's a tie. Problem was that I didn't find ORS 9G. Dang.
