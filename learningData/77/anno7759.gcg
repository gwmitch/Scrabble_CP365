#note Ah, there we go.

#note Bingo is too deep for me, of course, and beyond that I struggled a long time with this. Saw the INFRARED hook but had no idea and unwilling to risk against Kenji. Also saw (A)URAS but felt the AST leave was worth giving up the 3 pts.

#note Shoulda seen that one!!!

>Winter: AEMNSTW 2L ..WE +34 328
#note Now that K has close up the board, no need to open it with (T)W(I)NE and make it easy for him. With the lead, I'll take the closed board. Gave up the E for the points, in case it comes down to close endgame.

#note Missed the good one, but still in a strong position.

#note Saw the nine but too risky to chance it against Kenji.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ACO A1 CO.A +27 384
>Winter: ??DDORU 9L ..D +5 423
#note This was scary. I had to write down a bunch of possible alphagrams thru the L and convince myself that I was solid enough on that range of 8s to know there wasn't one.
