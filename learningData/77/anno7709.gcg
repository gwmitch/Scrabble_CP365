>Jim_Burlant: EEGHINU 8D HUEING +28 28
#note Phony.  It also beats any of the legitimate options hands-down; the next best plays sim more than 8 points down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEEX D8 .EXED +32 32
>Jim_Burlant: EFIJNOW E11 FEW +31 59
#note I3 JOWING wins the sim. Interestingly - despite giving up 5 scoreboard points to C9 FEW, this play sims interchangeably with it for silver medal honors.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?ACEHLP F2 PLEACH.s +76 108
#note H1 CEPHALIN scores 104, but this was a better choice for Sam, as you'll see in a second.
>Jim_Burlant: EIJKNOV -  +0 59
#note I've played Sam enough and he's tried so many phonies against me that against him, if I haven't seen it, I'll challenge it.  My best play here is obviously KOJI C11 44, which wins 35%.  Losing my turn with a completely avoidable decision brings my winning chances to just under 20.  This *should* have probably been the game, given his next rack.  When Darrell Day came over to adjudicate my challenge, his comment was, "That is as good as gold, but I'll look it up anyway."
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACELNNO 5D AN.LCONE +90 198
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACELNNO --  -90 108
#note Sam's star plays here are H1 CANNELON and 5F ANCONEAL.  Fortunately for me, he tried this instead because he obviously couldn't think of ANCONEAL.
>Jim_Burlant: EIJKNOV I3 JOKIN. +27 86
#note Another word I'd never seen, but given the situation - down 59 - 198 if his bingo stuck, I had to challenge it.  Darrell made two comments when he saw Sam's phony.  1)  "Sam, what on earth are you doing?"  2) after verifying the play was no good, "The book says this play is an abomination to Scrabble and should be taken off the board."  And for the rest of the evening, Sam was the, uh, butt of all our jokes.  More seriously...against a random rack my best play is obviously KOJI C11, but I have to block all his potential bingos.   Against this inference, this play is the clear sim winner, with nothing else coming close.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACELNNO J2 CON +22 130
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIRVW 1I VIEWIER +107 193
#note Now THAT is a present.   Was wondering what I was going to do with my no-go until he put CON down; I'd have probably been looking at VIEWIER 4A for 34.  Anyway - this was incorrectly scored as 110.  Even scored as 107, it wins 73%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEGLN K3 GEL +22 152
>Jim_Burlant: AIMOTUY F12 YOM +26 219
#note The second highest scoring option here (C9 YO), but Q doesn't like this a whole lot.  It prefers YOU in the same place by 4 points - eh...not sure I like setting up the triple for only 20 when there are 9 unseen tiles that would hook it on row 15.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ABR C9 BAR +30 182
>Jim_Burlant: AAIOSTU 7H U.AI +6 225
#note Whiffed on a bunch of b column plays.  B10 STOAI and B9 OSTIA win 74%; this play barely wins 68.  This would probably be much better if I left myself AEST instead of AOST.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IQ G1 QI +15 197
>Jim_Burlant: ADOSTUV 4D UV.A +14 239
#note The sim runner up - 3C OVALS wins by not quite 3 points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEILNTT N1 .NTITLED +72 269
#note Sam is back in the driver's seat, winning 58%.  I'm a little surprised that the M1 placement for 70 doesn't win the sim, as I would think it's too easy for me to come back down the O column.
>Jim_Burlant: DMORSTT O7 MORT +31 270
#note Anything at O7 that doesn't burn the S is pretty much as good as anything else according to the 2-ply sim.  This play finishes roughly 1 point down on O7 MOTT.  B10 STORM, and O7 DORM are also strong choices.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AA E3 A.A +18 287
>Jim_Burlant: ADERSTT L7 STARTED +73 343
#note Or 11I TETRADS; one is as good as the other, and now it's me in the driver's perch, winning 76%.
#note My annotation stops here - the rest of the game I draw all the remaining good tiles save for the blank, he can't score more than 18 points on any turn while I hit the Z for 39, etc.  Final score 430 - 360, my win.
