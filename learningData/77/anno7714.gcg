#note Now I'm feeling pretty good with Mitch low on time. I was pretty sure I could win without a bingo, but I should never understimate the ability of the tile gods to SCREW ME!!!

#note With the EIR? leave, I'm feeling great, but you never can tell. Q likes (L)IE, but THAT'S INSANE TO GIVE MITCH BACK THE PLAY.

#note AARRGHH!!!
>Winter: ?EIIOOR 6B O..O +6 353
#note No idea what to do here. I needed the scoring tiles, like the D or V if I was going to burn the blank. (L)IER probably wins, but only IF Mitch doesn't have the E.
