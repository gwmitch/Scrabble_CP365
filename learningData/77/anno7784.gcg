>Winter: EEGMNRU 3D UNMERGE +69 209
>Winter: EEGMNRU --  -69 140
#note How do you NOT try UNMERGE* in this situation? It's so low prob, and with a 34-point lead and a potential to go up a bingo, why wouldn't most players let it go? And how would you feel losing the game b/c you DIDN'T try it, after losing games the previous day for not trying (WHIFFLE)R or (PLUNK)Y.
