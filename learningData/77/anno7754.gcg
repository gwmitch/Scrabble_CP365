#note Thought I would have seen it near FOVEOLA, which is top 10K, but this one is top 14K, so I've only seen it once or twice.

#note To be expected, of course, when Famine is pulling the strings.
>Winter: AEHILOU A11 HAOLE +33 364
#note Anything other than a play at A11 is insane. I consider LEHUA, but I was down so much that basically I need to max out my score and get lucky with the final two tiles to win.
>Jesse_Day: ADEEJST 11H .ADJES +30 389
#note I held, suspecting it was phony, but why would he play it for an extra two points when he goes out with SET anyway??? Didn't make sense, and being the first game, I didn't want to needlessly give up spread.
