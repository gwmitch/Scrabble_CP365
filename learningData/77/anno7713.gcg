>Winter: CDDOORS 8G DOC +12 12
>Verna_Berg: IQS J6 QIS +39 39
>Winter: DLORSUW 7F LOW +16 28
#note I want an open board.
>Verna_Berg: GIJ E5 JIG +30 69
>Winter: ADORRSU D7 ARDOURS +77 105
>Verna_Berg: BEKRR 10B BR.KER +20 89
>Winter: AAEILNW K4 WAIN +27 132
#note No way, not giving up 6 points just to keep AILN or AELN vs AEL!
>Verna_Berg: ?AIMSTX 12A MAT.IXeS +70 159
>Winter: AEFILRT 4H FLA.IER +34 166
#note Take the points, go for the turnover, and hope for the challenge. I saw IF, but I sensed that AELRT was goingto lead into a bad rack.
>Verna_Berg: BEG 3M BEG +22 181
>Winter: ADEELTU 3G DEALT +27 193
#note Again, trying to get to those power tiles before Vampire Vlerna gets them. Q of course wants to give up points and go for a bingo, but I'm not feeling lucky.
>Verna_Berg: ?OOPSTU 11G OUTPOSt +70 251
>Winter: EEFHIRU E10 .H. +30 223
#note Now I want to slow the game down and give myself as much chance as possible to catch up, and Verna as much opportunity as possible to screw up.
>Verna_Berg: AOY A12 .AYO +27 278
#note I need for her to stop getting easy scores though.
>Winter: EEEFIRU B14 EF +25 248
#note Again, I want to score with as few tiles as possible. I'm not going to gamble on a bingo on this board, because I know Verna's style is to block everything (which has often cost her games).
>Verna_Berg: CEHO L8 CHO.E +26 304
#note Yep, she's screwing up all right, either missing the play or giving up too many points, but she is still scoring too much!!!
>Winter: ADEEIRU 8L .UED +21 269
#note Q likes (C)UE, but I would never have played it, knowing Verna's style. She will definitely block.
>Verna_Berg: EEIL O7 E.ILE +6 310
#note See--she can score 21 and go up by almost a bingo but instead chooses to block for 6. This play alone should have cost her the game.
>Winter: AEIRTVY N2 T..RY +32 301
#note Really want to ditch the VY with V(ER)Y, but I can count on Vlerna to have an E.
>Verna_Berg: AZ O1 ZA. +41 351
#note Of course--without this she probably loses.
>Winter: AEINOPV 13I OVINE +29 330
>Verna_Berg: EN C12 .EN +16 367
#note I might have a chance.	
>Winter: AEINNNP I13 .N +2 332
#note Gotta try it and hope she screws up.
>Verna_Berg: AV J13 .AV +15 382
>Winter: AEGINNP 15J .ANING +33 365
#note Oh, why not--she can't risk the challenge.
>Verna_Berg: IMTTU 9L .M +17 399
>Winter: EP 2F PE +13 378
#note NINE FREAKING POWER TILES SHE DREW, AND ALL SHE COULD DO WAS WIN By 15!!!
>Winter:  (ITTU) +8 386
