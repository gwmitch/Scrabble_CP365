>Ricky_Purnomo: ABEJM 8D JAMBE +48 48
>Toh_Weibin: EFINOPZ I7 FEZ +46 46
#note Wasn't 100% sure of JAMBEE but I remembered seeing it years ago. Had to play it.
>Ricky_Purnomo: EOTTU E4 OUTE.T +12 60
>Toh_Weibin: IKNOPVX D3 VOX +39 85
>Ricky_Purnomo: EISTU D8 .ESUIT +28 88
#note Ricky told me his tiles almost allowed him to play (B)USUUTIS.
>Toh_Weibin: EIKNPSV C9 PINKS +50 135
#note I chose this over KNIVES J3 because the -VE combination was still potent at the J collumn. This move also restricted his scoring possibilities around the JESUIT region.
>Ricky_Purnomo: RRU 7I .URR +7 95
>Toh_Weibin: BEGIILV L1 BILGIE. +26 161
#note I probably should have played VIBIER here. EVIL L8 is another option I saw but I didn't think it was strategically sound.
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?AAEERS 1G ERASA.lE +77 172
#note 4 timer AR(R)ASEnE is playable.
>Toh_Weibin: AAANNTV J9 AVANT +27 188
>Ricky_Purnomo: DNORW 11G ONW.RD +20 192
>Toh_Weibin: ADILNOW 3I WOA.D +26 214
#note I felt INDOW 14J gave him many opportunities to counterscore, and keeping the I might work out later. Turns out the moves are pretty close.
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?HINRST 5G SHIRT.Ng +70 262
#note A few higher-scoring choices available, like TaRNISH/ RuNTISH B4 for 89.
>Toh_Weibin: DGILNOO 10L OD +6 220
#note The best play here would be ONDING, I suspect - gives a semi-decent chance of coming back. I didn't see it and decided instead to create some trouble. I opened up another line and telegraphed an A or E - hoping he'd be baited and let me use AVANTI next move. DOON 12G seems to work too if I'm thinking of fishing.
>Ricky_Purnomo: AER 12J .EAR +18 280
>Toh_Weibin: EGILLNO 14F LOGLINE +73 293
#note And I draw a bingo! This opens the board dangerously though..
>Ricky_Purnomo: Q 10B Q.. +32 312
#note Here's where I think Ricky made the game-losing mistake. He told me later that he could have taken the 15L scoring spot (albeit with low-scoring tiles), which seems much more dangerous than 15H. I don't see Q(IS) being blocked anytime soon.
>Toh_Weibin: AFLMNYY 15L FLAY +51 344
>Ricky_Purnomo: OP 15G PO +25 337
>Toh_Weibin: EHMNOUY 14N HM +31 375
#note HO in the same spot sims better - probably keeping the M to score elsewhere.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DEI 13C ..IED +18 355
>Toh_Weibin: CEGNOUY M3 .U.NY +33 408
#note Not much to see from this move on. CONEY N7 is an out-in-two but I don't think I saw the bag was empty.
