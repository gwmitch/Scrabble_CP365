#note Not sure why I didn't play WOE 9C.  I must have been too fixated on setting up my S hook.
>Kenji: HOPQ 9C QOPH +41 61
#note It also would have prevented this from happening.  You don't see this word get played much anymore.
>Joey: ?EINSTY K5 cYSTEIN +93 105
#note Bravo to you if you found ETHINYLS G2.  Not often does a bingo that hits no multi-word squares score more than a bingo that hits two multi-word squares.
>Kenji: OX J9 OX +52 113
#note I forgot to mention that DESTINY or CYSTINE were better defensively.  Mistakes are not being gotten away with.
