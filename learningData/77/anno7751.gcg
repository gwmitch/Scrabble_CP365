#note OVONIC is very slightly worse sim wise.... but there's probably a bigger strategic difference.

#note quackle likes this or OKE. i really don't know what to think about OKE, it doesn't seem right. but i might have a homeless bingo if i do BONE.

>Cesar: DEIMRRS 14J MER.S +30 189
#note 14A RIMS is simming best, and 12A MIRI is immediately after. MERCS is a bad move because it gives up many more points and results in a lower score for me... so it's not just a strategic mistake.  -10. another choice a lot of people might pick is something like 7A ID. does anyone think this is actually the right move and may be worth it?

#note maybe just tithe. ? also pretty close.
>maddy: IIII -IIII +0 219
>Cesar: AILOQTW 5I QAT +30 251
#note -6, another mistake. i think i shouldn't kill a lane if i can't kill both, plus the game is close anyway. maybe J2 QAT is better. ?

#note ID is a little better.. -1
>maddy: AF B1 FA +19 315
>Cesar: AEGHINW C2 HWAN +26 305
#note i totally screwed up. i had the right idea with 14A HAW but then thought she could do something like PHI. running out of time i went for C2 HWAN hoping to get lucky. her avg score after HAW is very low.

#note pili is the right play, i ran out of time.
