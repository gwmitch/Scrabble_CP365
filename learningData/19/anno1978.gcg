>Sam: EILNOOR 8C LOONIER +66 66
#note Took a moment here to think about placement. Quackle likes it best at 8D, followed by 8F, 8G, and (my) 8C. I honestly couldn't tell you why...better to give up fewer DWS opportunities? But 8D puts the E next to the DLS...this is an area where I could improve a little.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: EOV F5 OVE. +15 15
>Sam: ?BGSWXY 5E B.XY +32 98
#note SEXY 7E, which I didn't spot, looks better by a decent amount according to Quackle. Might as well take the 14 extra points and the 97-point lead.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: ABDN H1 BAND. +39 54
>Sam: ?GLOSSW 3C SLOWi.GS +76 174
>Sam: ?GLOSSW --  -76 98
#note Idiocy. SuNGLOWS is the only real bingo in here (didn't know it). Playing phonies (and having them challenged off) was one of my biggest problems in this tournament.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: AJN 7E J.AN +26 80
>Sam: ?GLOSSW E7 ..WLS +30 128
#note Again, SuNGLOWS, but I still don't know it. I seriously considered playing NEWSbLOGS* here. JOWLS is the best play other than SuNGLOWS.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: DUY 10C DU.Y +16 96
#note Rose is clearly struggling through junk here, as she would for most of the game.
>Sam: ?EGIOST 4F dO.GIEST +84 212
>Rose_Kreiswirth: EHIMST 2H .THEISM +40 136
>Sam: ADEEELR 1L LEAD +27 239
>Rose_Kreiswirth: KP K1 P.K. +18 154
>Sam: AEEORRV 11E .AVORER +25 264
#note Better than SEROVAR, since the Z is still lurking. (Okay, I didn't know SEROVAR in Orlando, but still)
>Rose_Kreiswirth: ACMRTTU 10J MAC +25 179
>Sam: EEIOUUZ -EIUU +0 264
#note Keeping the O for a shot at drawing the N for OZONE H11 72. Quackle likes this trade as well.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: EGNTU H10 T.NGUE +24 203
#note Well, I picked up the N, but Rose played on the H column.
>Sam: EINORTZ C10 .ITZ +28 292
#note I remember taking a while on this play. Most plays here have drawbacks. DITZ doesn't score best, and doesn't really block the eight lines, not to mention the wide open MACE or MACS hook. Quackle likes ZEROING best, which I dismissed for the easy row 14 underlaps it permitted, considering the four As unseen. I should have just gone with the points though--ZEROING scores a nice 36, and she can only score 36 or so with ZA in most cases. ZEROING also gives seven chances for the blank, which she probably didn't hold when she played TONGUE>
>Rose_Kreiswirth: DEFIIN 14H .NIFIED +26 229
#note Well, she sure helped me out with this play, mostly blocking the eight lines.
>Sam: CEFNORW 15L FROW +56 348
#note My seemingly ugly CFW draw turns into gold after her play.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: EEGRT M7 GREET +17 246
#note Another strange play by Rose, but she's really down after my play of FROW, and only a huge bingo can save her.
>Sam: AACEINQ 13J QI +27 375
#note AE D13 and AECIAL C3 are both interesting. AE blocks the best bingo lane, row 15, but makes row 12 plays like PATH or PITH higher-scoring. AECIAL digs into the bag and leaves the nice QI spot (6B), but I would worry about disaster draws to the NQ leave. There wasn't a need to get rid of the Q just yet, so QI was somewhat unnecessary.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: HIP 12A PI.H +24 270
>Sam: ?AACENU A12 .ACA +24 399
#note sAUCEPAN, a tough find which I haven't come close to studying (but should have studied, of course), is the only bingo and easily best.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: AALOORS D12 .ALO +19 289
>Sam: ?ENOSTU C3 TUNnE. +12 411
#note Quackle's Champ player points out ShOTE 5K, a word I didn't know, because it leaves UNDULY 10A for the out. TRUE 8L is also superior to TUNnEL.
>Rose_Kreiswirth: AEIRU 8K AU.EI +18 307
>Sam: OS 5K SO +28 439
#note My first double-blank game of the tourney, and last until facing Marlon in Round 15. It's nice to be able to coast on the tiles for a change, and gave me confidence going into the last two rounds of the opening day.
>Sam:  (R) +2 441
