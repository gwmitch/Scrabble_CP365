>Sam: AAEENPV 9D PAVANE +21 21
#note VEENA 9G is much better, and really controls the board.
>Edward_de_Guzman: BFRU G6 FUB.R +20 32
>Sam: AEEIMRU H1 UREMIA +38 59
#note FUBAR really salvaged this otherwise subpar rack.
>Edward_de_Guzman: EKU D9 .UKE +20 52
>Sam: DEGNOSZ 13B ZED +38 97
#note Quackle strongly prefers ZOOS J6, which I considered.    The Z is susceptible to both column B and row 14 plays for nice scores, while ZOOS starts closing up the board nicely and scores. Got a little too S-attached here.
>Edward_de_Guzman: ?AEIINR 1H .REdINIA +74 126
>Sam: DGNOSTW I3 DONG +26 123
#note Quackle again likes dumping off the S for few points with K4 GOWDS 30. I wanted to keep the S for the possible BOHOS hook, but does the W make my rack that much worse? Isn't STW more than 4 points > NT? The sim suggests it's only 1 point better. Some other reason why GOWDS is superior? I'm confused by this position.
>Edward_de_Guzman: AB 14A BA +30 156
>Sam: CNNSTWY A14 .Y +21 144
#note I was all set to play WYN or WYNN 10I before his play of BA. I inferred (correctly, as it turns out) that he probably had OP or something on his rack. However, there's really no need to make this sensless block (I think?). Even if he has the right tiles, unless he has something like OPERATE or APEX it won't be devastating. I should start working toward my bingo with WYN.
>Edward_de_Guzman: EU 11C U.E +14 170
>Sam: CLNNSTW I8 ..WN +10 154
#note Ugly play. The bag isn't nearly vowel-heavy enough to justify this. The neat ANENST E9 (which I didn't know) is best, but many exchanges are better than HEWN.
>Edward_de_Guzman: OP H11 OP +9 179
>Sam: CLMNSTT E8 C.M.LS +30 184
>Edward_de_Guzman: AIR 4H ..IRA +14 193
>Sam: HJLNOTT 7J JOLT +21 205
#note Or HOT 2J, Quackle's choice, but I like JOLT better. 
>Edward_de_Guzman: GIST N4 GITS +19 212
>Sam: EEFHNTX 13G HEX +30 235
#note I prefer my play to the myriad of row 2 plays (FET's best among them). He's been sort-of fishing, and row 13 is really dangerous. Plus, I keep FET as a minimum for row 2.
>Edward_de_Guzman: WY K3 W.Y +18 230
>Sam: DEEFINT 14F FED +27 262
#note I'm sure you're shocked that I didn't play the bingo, as I was when I typed this rack into Quackle. I'm perfect (7/7) on the rack in cardbox, and it's a common word of course. How I missed FEINTED is beyond me. A more comprehensive review before Nationals would have helped here. I was all lined up to play FETED 2J 58 before WRY went down. DEF 2L is probably best of the non-bingos.
>Edward_de_Guzman: ?EORSTV L7 .EVaTORS +72 302
>Sam: AEIINOT 6M I. +4 266
#note Is this a little too early for a desperation fish? This yields bingos with draws of the C, L, N, R, or T (7/18 tiles). Quackle likes IOTA O3 here, which is strange. It's likely that Ed will block one of the two lines, and probably the row 2 line with something like AG G2 (for example). I give myself a good chance to draw a bingo ending in N for the column B line.  
>Edward_de_Guzman: ACDE 14J CA.ED +28 330
>Sam: AEILNOT B5 ELATION +69 335
#note TOENAIL(ED) is good, which I didn't know. It's much worse than ELATION, though, and would have been disastrous with Ed's real rack.
>Edward_de_Guzman: AGINORT A1 TANGO +26 356
#note Quackle suggests GROIN or GIRON A1, which don't allow QIS C3. Ed was pretty low on time at this point, though.
>Sam: EILQST C3 QIS +27 362
>Edward_de_Guzman: IR N12 RI. +4 360
#note Great game by Ed. Who knows what would have happened if I found FEINTED, or even looked for it. That one horrible play destroyed an otherwise decent game.
>Edward_de_Guzman:  (ELT) +6 366
