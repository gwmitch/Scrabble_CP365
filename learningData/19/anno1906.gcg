#note trying to rein in the board some...quackle would rather I play something like EYE or CREOLE, but I prefer COSIE.

>Jesse_Day: ?BILOTT L1 BLOT +27 248
#note sure felt like I was missing a bingo, but I guess not. almost boatlift! If I were paranoid, maybe I could just play BOT there and not open the triple-triple, but it seemed like hubris.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: MPU 1L .UMP +30 166
>Jesse_Day: ?IKRRRT 3K ..RK +22 270
#note my play sims out well, but I'm actually unhappy with it because it opened an S hook that I would have to deal with much later. I'd much rather play something like KIER at 6I, leave bedamned.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: ?ABDIOR 6C InBOARD +68 234
#note Believe it or not, one of the guys at the board next to ours had just bingoed with the exact same rack, and played lABROID! Marjorie didn't even notice until I pointed it out.
>Jesse_Day: ?DINRRT 9C DIRT +20 290
#note gotta be questionable because of the number of Os out there, and the potential that she could hit a play that gets her back in the game right away. But the only other real competitor is NITRID through the I, and that one opens the board up for big plays too!
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: AIS C12 AIS +24 258
#note uhoh
>Jesse_Day: ?GGNPRX G10 P.X +25 315
#note yikes! she'd better not bingo down from WORK...
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: EM D12 ME +21 279
>Jesse_Day: ?GGNQRY -GGNQY +0 315
#note So much for knowing how to play scrabble. I actually think quackle's best play is great - EGGY at 6K blocks the biggest source of worry on the board and will likely allow me to pull out the win. Of the exchanges, quackle likes keeping GNR?, which I thought was absolutely repulsive at the time, but actually looks reasonable given how many Is are in the pool. The G still looks horrible on this board, though. I'm not sure I like quackle's exchange suggestions. I wish I'd seen EGGY.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: HILNNOS E4 NI. +10 289
>Jesse_Day: ?HIIORW O1 .I +4 319
#note OK, I know this looks absolutely ridiculous, but here's what I was thinking - column O is easily the most dangerous spot on the board. I have all the high pointers, so row 8 is pretty much exclusively mine - I can wait to cash that in. So why not block? And as for blocks, I think dropping the I there may be the only one that makes any sense. Possible contenders are WHO at 8A or WHIN at 4B, but I think it makes much more sense to hold onto my guaranteed fifty point play next turn and block the most dangerous spot on the board.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: IQ D3 QI +26 315
>Jesse_Day: ?GHIORW 8A GROW +50 369
#note the Is are gone, so GROW is a safe play now...knowing that she has the S, there is exactly one play that she could hit to win the game: NOSOLOGY, which I had to find with zyzzyva. I would eat my shoe if she found that. If she doesn't have to have the S then she might have OENOLOGY, but she HAS to have it. There are literally no other possible miracle bingos anywhere. I'll take GROW.
>Marjorie_Schoneboom: EGLNOSY H1 LONGE. +27 342
#note missing my outbingo
>Jesse_Day: ?HILNOO A1 sHOOLIN. +86 455
#note Also HOLLOING. Probably wouldn't know that SHOOLING was good without the studying I did before nationals. at least it was good for something!
>Jesse_Day:  (SY) +10 465
#note Like the game against Evan the day before, it seems as though I stepped up my game for the last round of the day each day - maybe I'd finally figured out how to play scrabble by that point, and forgotten overnight. Marj is such a pleasant opponent that I was able to ease up on myself on the various debacles of the day (cf games against webster, kenji and lester) and go enjoy the evening.
