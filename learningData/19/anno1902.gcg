#note Set up two places for my S, sure.
>Cathy_Osickey: AGOS J8 SAGO +23 49
#note Hating this board already.
>Ryan_Fischer: DELORSY K10 OY +23 33
#note Missed YODLERS.  I quit Scrabble.  :)  YOD is definitely better than OY, too.  Oy.
>Cathy_Osickey: IIII -IIII +0 49
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFLPRS 12D PELFS +34 67
#note My punishment for missing YODLERS, I must now spend my S to keep up.
>Cathy_Osickey: HII F10 HI.I +15 64
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEGRU I3 ARGUE. +14 81
#note Something must be done about this board...  URED(I)A 13B 29 is best, though.
>Cathy_Osickey: BHU H1 HUB +28 92
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEGRRX 3H ..RGED +20 101
#note Best, thankfully.  Whatta tough rack, though.
>Cathy_Osickey: APTY E11 P.ATY +30 122
>Ryan_Fischer: CEMRRX 15A MERC. +45 146
#note Incomplete rack.  Oops.  She paid for the Y, though.  :)

#note Now, this rack changed the game.  What happens here is I slot the J two away from the DWS.  Anyone who uses it will likely set up an S hook.  Whoever USES said hook will likely win.  JE(E)D L1 is 40, okay leave, slots the J in the TWS line.  I didn't really consider it, 'cause I wanted to play through this crap and hope to score well with the X next turn, and maybe draw a blank.  I didn't know what's right.  I'm probably only so fixated on the J because I lost, but if I wouldn't've missed YODLERS, I'd be up by 90 now instead of just 40.

#note What I was afraid of.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELNNOUX 13A L.X +20 194
#note OXEN M5 never even occured to me.  I'm always so fixated on using bonus squares, I sometimes forget you can score well without using them.  XENON M6 is cool too.
>Cathy_Osickey: EF G6 FE. +22 183
>Ryan_Fischer: EELNNOU F2 LEONE +16 210
#note I like this play, and it's somewhat decent.  Best scoring, gives me five more grabs at the blank.
>Cathy_Osickey: IIII -IIII +0 183
#note Ut oh, looks like someone got one...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADINOU K5 UDO +18 228
#note I am thankful... that there were no bingos, and this is the best play (well, third best, wrong spot -- it scores 1 more at E5).
>Cathy_Osickey: ?AESTTW O2 SWATTEr +93 276
#note *cries*
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIINOV 3B OVIN. +16 244
#note Missed AVIONIc.  Oh well, two misses in a close game.  Can't cry about anything now.  Was hoping this set of lines created will help me catch up.
>Cathy_Osickey: AINO N7 NAOI +9 285
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIINOO -IIOO +0 244
#note 'tis what I get for missing.  Kept AN? 'cause there's more Is left to be drawn.
>Cathy_Osickey: EILR B1 RE.IL +10 295
#note Wow, I cannot see where she thought this was a good move.  Makes it all the more embarrassing that I lose.  I thought, hm, I can take D(R)AW, empty the bag, hope I draw something good and she doesn't block.  The Q is still out. 
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEINW A4 bEDAWIN +83 327
#note Or I can try this phony.  There is nothing in this rack.  I thought there's an alternate spelling of BEDOUIN like this, but I can't seem to place it.  Oh well.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEINW --  -83 244
>Cathy_Osickey: AIKN A5 AKIN +26 321
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEINW O10 DEWANs +42 286
#note D(R)AWN 1A is now best.  Prevents her from getting too much for her Q.
>Cathy_Osickey: EIOOQS D2 Q.S +24 345
>Ryan_Fischer: I 14N I. +4 290
>Ryan_Fischer:  (EIOO) +8 298
#note Oh well.  Play well, you should win.  Play like this, you deserve to lose.  Drew badly, sure, but that's no excuse.
