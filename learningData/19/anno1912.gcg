>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEGOUV 8D VOGUE +26 26
#note Okay, I didn't look too hard at this rack, but I figured the OVUG combo wasn't that great, and played VOGUE pretty quickly.  OUTGAVE is the winner though.  Given that I draw the other blank on the next turn, it's a bigger miss than I would've liked.
>Matthew_Ridout: IJ F6 JI. +27 27
#note Okay, take your time, find the star play...
>Ryan_Fischer: ??ABENR H1 EaRNABl. +77 103
#note And no, a phony is not it.  :)  I thought I had a pretty good grasp on -ABLE words.  Guess I was wrong.  :)  sEABoRN(E) or mEmBRAN(E) for the win, BTW.  I also overscored it by 3.  Whoops.
>Matthew_Ridout: AU 6F .U.A +13 40
>Ryan_Fischer: AFGORSU J2 FRUGS +35 138
#note Close it up a bit, take the points.  I could see someone playing FOURS for a bit better leave, too.
>Matthew_Ridout: ADEEHI 3B HEADIE. +24 64
#note Down a bit, you should probably slow it down...
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELOOP 2A LOOP +28 166
#note D6 LE(V)ODOPA 78.  I've seen this word before, too, floating around on someone's blog or another.  Mine's second best.
>Matthew_Ridout: ORUW D8 .ROUW +22 86
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEETW 4D WED +36 202
#note Best.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEILNRZ 11D .NLAZIER +118 204
#note Feeling pretty confident about high prob power 8s, I challenge.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEILNRZ --  -118 86
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAEIST -AA +0 202
#note I can dump AA on the board or throw it back in the bag.  I know his rack, and I don't want to open anything up, so exchanging is better for me, I think, and hopefully put the game away on the next turn.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEILNRZ 11B AZ.RE +28 114
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEISTT 5J .ET +8 210
#note Oh well, can't draw 'em all.  9B AIREST was an option last turn, and still is.  With the lead I have, it's not a bad one, either.  I probably shouldn't be opening like this, but I would love to make up some spread, and this game seems to be a chance.
>Matthew_Ridout: AILMN 10F MALIN +25 139
#note Just pure instinct here that something smelled fishy about this word.  I'm not nearly 100% on the 5s, though I have seen them all a couple times.  
>Matthew_Ridout: AILMN --  -25 114
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILNST 13A ELASTIN +78 288
#note He didn't open anything, and I didn't find the optimum play.  Shame.  That is, my play scores most of any available, but it slots the E for an easy 30-point counter, when I know he has at least one scoring tile (M).  SLAINTE/GET(A) is best, taking this into consideration.
>Matthew_Ridout: ADILMN A12 M.AD +30 144
>Ryan_Fischer: CEFGNPT 1A EFT +36 324
#note Best.
>Matthew_Ridout: ACILNOS 12G ALNICOS +72 216
#note M1 OILCANS is best.  I'm not that deep into the 7s, but recognize ALNICOS.  An idea of how far I have to go, but also, how it doesn't take really DEEP word knowledge to do well.  It sure HELPS, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGKNPR M3 PRANK +37 361
#note Debated between PRANK and CRANK with two Ys out.  Sure CRANK takes the Y, but not that PRANK does.  I shoulda played CRANK, but C>P.  Not with the G, though.  Who knows.  GIVEN that there is another C in the bag, I SHOULD play mine anyway.  PR(I)CK J10 29 is another option, leaving a better-balanced AGN.
>Matthew_Ridout: AELMNOT 14F TELAMON +74 290
#note Wow.  It's a game now.
>Ryan_Fischer: CGIIRTY 8L GYRI +45 406
#note Tough rack.  The best balancing move is to play GYRI, but where?  9B is only 14, but still 3rd best, no sim.  If PRANKERS* isn't good, why would PRANKY* be?  I intuited it didn't take the Y, but he was forced to challenge if he had any hope of crawling back into it.  Oops.  The star play is the fancy B10 G(A)I(L)Y 40.  CY(DE)R E1 is fancy, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: CGIIRTY --  -45 361
>Matthew_Ridout: IQ N2 QI +26 316
#note He's forced to do something that'll hurt him more in the long run.
>Ryan_Fischer: CGIIRTY O1 CIG +35 396
#note Missing CITY for 55.  :/
>Matthew_Ridout: BDEIOOS 10F DOOBIES +73 389
#note Missing BOODIES.  Wow, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: IINRTYY 15I YIN +17 413
#note Fairly straightforward endgame.  I've tracked perfectly and have plenty of time.  I can play the flashy TYIYN 9J.  This allows HEX at 15I, which is fine, though I could block it instead with YIN 15I, leaving (D)IRTY to go out.  The star play, though, is TINY 5B, which I obviously did not see.
>Matthew_Ridout: EHTVX 10A EH +26 415
#note He doesn't see my out, and somewhat flustered, forgets he should probably dump the X, as I'm not too concerned with using the hotspot he takes.  13M HEX is another option overlooked by both of us.
>Ryan_Fischer: IRTY 15A .IRTY +10 423
>Ryan_Fischer:  (TVX) +26 449
#note In hindsight, I got really lucky (but wow, so did he).  Missed two bingos, got double-blanked, and his late bingo-bango-(qi)-bongo and my slip ups should've cost me.  Pretty sloppy now that I go back and look at it.
