>Dave: DUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note I stifled a laugh here. I feel like in the 8 or 9 times we've played prior to this game, this is maybe the third time he's opened with WUD.
>Phil: BCENTYZ 9D BYTE +16 16
#note Pretty tough rack for this early position. BYTE does the best job of doing something constructive while encouraging a more open board.
>Dave: AJOT 8A JOTA +41 55
>Phil: CGHMNOZ B6 ZO.M +35 51
#note Kneejerk play. GONZO is better.
>Dave: IIII -IIII +0 55
>Phil: CDEGHNN -DGN +0 51
#note Some sort of exchange here, but probably not this.
>Dave: AIQ I6 QA.I +16 71
>Phil: CEHNNRS 7H N.H +8 59
#note An appropriate word choice for a pretty uninspired play. SYNCH is what's called for.
>Dave: ?DEEEPW 10I sWEEPED +86 157
#note My theory on this sort of thing is that it's a terrible idea to spend so much of one's time playing against bots who never phony, because you get into the habit of simply accepting the other guy's play without a second glance. When I'm an active and regular club/tourney player, I don't let shit like this get by me. He could've played SPEWEED* here instead and I wouldn't have noticed. I didn't even hold on this morphologic abortion, and maybe 10 minutes later looked at it and said "Wait, that's not how you English."
>Phil: CENOPRS L8 CR.PON +26 85
#note Let's see, in one move we manage to a) accept a word that any 6-year old could tell you is no good, b) burn 6 minutes of clock trying and failing to find NECROPSY for 92, c) choose maybe the 18th best non-bingo play, or d) all of the above. Wow. Just wow. Is there a worse play to be made here? I mean, I'm probably better off playing QE* and announcing my score as 9. At least then I'll get a second chance to find the bingo. I hear Candy Land is fun.

>Phil: AAENRST 14C SANTERA +64 149
#note Yet another game where I do something dopey and get rewarded with an easy bingo.
>Dave: DIU 6I .UID +23 210
>Phil: ADGHIIR 15A GRID +31 180
#note Missed GADID, but in retrospect that probably saved me about 10 minutes of clock. Man I was slow this weekend.

#note Uh, C3 VOLANT? This is nowhere close to correct.
>Dave: ACFT 3J FACT +32 282
>Phil: AGILLSV C2 VILLA +27 276
#note Trying to keep pace and force Dave to find an 8 with his blank instead.

#note Couldn't figure out the optimal way to delay bingoing here, which appears to be E9 YOU. Bingoing now gives EMOTIVE a home and a win, although in all non-EMOTIVE cases I expect to pick up a lot of spread with a challenge. I also considered C10 ER (despite the rest of this game serving as strong evidence to the contrary, the first possibility I saw there was drawing the V for [pick a 7]/VAVASOUR) which isn't perfect but wins a few more cases than the text.
