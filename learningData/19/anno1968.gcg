#note Taking a page out of some experts book on an annotated game I saw, yes, I actually threw an S back in.  I don't know if it was right, but on this board who knew how useful they would be.  (YAW)NS is an interesting alternative.

>Ryan_Fischer: AENNSTY J9 Y.AN +15 110
#note Bleh, he took forever on this move, and I played too fast.  YEANS N11 to keep the pace, stop fishing already.
>Ben_Harrison: AEERRTT N5 RETREAT +63 243
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINSTT 14E INSTATE +63 173
#note Oops.  Kay, how'd I do this?  My line of thinking: hm, I have SATINET... but that puts an I in the triple like.  Can I do something more defensive?  Does it have any anagrams?  Well, sure, INSTATE.  Play that!  ...doh.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINSTT --  -63 110

#note Cool extension for RETREAT: RETREATANT.
>Ben_Harrison: COZ H12 ZO.C +75 345
#note And this was why I was worried in the first place, although to be fair, it's more of a concern one row higher, and something like ZI(T)I would still be possible otherwise.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINTU 8M U.N +9 182
#note I have no idea what my 7th letter was, just that it didn't help me here.  Only bright spot in this miserable game, I blocked another bingo of his with that play.
>Ben_Harrison: ADELR 15K ALDER +24 369
#note I am not sure that this is what he played.  I totally forgot to write this play down.  He was incredibly low on time, so I was trying to play fast, too.  With the pool of letters left over from the plays I do know, ALDER was his high scoring play, but didn't score the 32 we recorded.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEINOT 1D ATONIEs +77 259
#note Dammit, he blocked the flashiest play I'd've ever made, sONI(C)ATE 15D, forming SO, AN, TI, NA, ET, and UTE.  I didn't, however, see something almost as flashy, AcETONI(C) 15A, forming SO, AN, and TI.
>Ben_Harrison: IMV 15D VIM +18 387
>Ryan_Fischer: CDGIJNO 2A JINGO +31 290
>Ben_Harrison: IX 4H XI +28 415
#note Again, I couldn't find where he'd play XI for just 18.  So I'm guessing in his haste he underscored it by 10 here and I didn't see it.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDFGOOR O10 GOOF +14 304
#note I'm really out of it, obviously, an aficionado of odd power words, yet I miss the glaringly obvious F(J)ORD for 51, blocking (J)AvELINS, and salvaging a cruddy game.
>Ben_Harrison: ?AEILNS B1 A.rLINES +59 474
#note He misses (J)AvELINS and (J)AwLINES, and goes over by almost 3 minutes, finally settling on this.
