>Robert: ?DEEEHP G2 EPHEDr.E +67 73
#note Oops. Make that EPHEDRAE*. It looked reasonably plausible, and I had a decent comeback. The only playable bingo is 9G wHEEPED.
>Mike: FHIILMS H1 SLIM +43 71
#note Of course, accepting EPHEDRAE would've been more right (?) if I'd seen 5E FLEMISH or H1 SHIM, as opposed to this play (which is the best of the others). Jeepers, I play badly sometimes.
>Robert: AWY D11 WAY +29 102
>Mike: FHILRRT I5 FRITH +23 94
#note Same play at C8 is two points better.
>Robert: PU 6E PU. +8 110
>Mike: AEILLRW F10 AW +23 117
#note WALL C12 wins the sim. Why, exactly, did I decide to play scared here?
>Robert: AC 13B CA. +16 126
>Mike: AAEILLR 5I .LAIL +16 133
#note B10 LAICAL sims best. I saw it, but opted against it because (a) I wasn't 100% on it and (b) given that he's been fishing, I don't particularly feel like opening a triple line. (Note: For this sim, I'm inferring an S.)
>Robert: DEIINRS J9 INSIDER +67 193
#note Why not at N3? Also, find the playable nine.
>Mike: AEERTTY 15H TE.RY +36 169
#note Best.
>Robert: AMO 4K MOA +20 213
>Mike: AEGINTV 2G ..EVATING +92 261
#note "Oh no, he blocked LEVATING. (Pause) Wait a second...." The only playable bingo.
>Robert: OOZ 5C ZOO +32 245
>Mike: CEELTUX I2 .X +37 298
#note Quackle favors taking the points with 12G EXCITE. I can see the merit of this, and the pool is friendly enough that turnover is good. I don't remember what my rationale was here.
>Robert: DEO C3 DO.E +28 273
>Mike: CEELTUV L12 LEV. +20 318
#note Quackle prefers CUTELY in the same spot, presumably for defense. I don't really feel I'm ahead by enough to start thinking in those terms; maybe I should.
>Robert: AQT 2B QAT +39 312
>Mike: CEOORTU 4A CO.T +22 340
#note Either K9 COO or 13G OUTDOER would be an improvement. Not sure why I didn't consider COO. After this play, even though I have a 28 point lead, the game is basically a tossup.
>Robert: BIKR B10 BRI.K +38 350
>Mike: DEOORRU A4 .RUOR +21 361
#note Quackle prefers several other plays; heading the list are K7 RODEO (maybe I was spot-blind) or CORDER (wasn't sure of it) in the same place as my move. I can understand this; with ?JSS out, turnover is paramount.
>Robert: EGS N1 E.GS +11 361
>Mike: ?DEIIOS M12 ID +14 375
#note My move is one of 15 listed by Championship Player as being 100% to win. However, 13J DIE tops the list; I'm guessing this is because any bingos drawn will be unblockable. I decided that his rack would be too awkward to win with anyway.
>Robert: JNNNNTU N10 JUN +29 390
#note (Misscored as 30.)
>Mike: ?AEIOS O8 ArOSE +31 406
#note Wasn't expecting the A! The optimal out-in-two is 15J OSE and 1L IlEA in some order. The outplay of ArIOSE is three points back; my play is nine back.
>Robert: NNNT 9I ..NT +7 397
>Mike: I C13 .I +8 414
#note Can't say I deserved that one, but I'll take it. (Score recorded as 418-398.)
>Mike:  (NN) +4 418
