#note This is a really tough rack.  I took a long time trying to figure out what to exchange.  I think I threw in ILLOU, keeping I?.  It doesn't make sense, given that there's an I out in the 2x2, but no other tiles make sense to keep.  I don't like playing LOUI(E) or (V)IOL.  Why open things up like that?  Any sage advice anywhere on how to deal with situations like this?

#note Well, whatever I exchanged, it worked.  Best.  This, or OVErSPI(N) 4C.  Two cool finds, twice making the blank an L, one of my most loathed letters.  Heh.  Drawing like a beast, but I guess I'm earning it.

#note First glance, (I)GG does look best; don't know why I passed it up.  I don't know which is better, AEGNT or AENPT.  AGENT(IN)G or NEGAT(IN)G keeping P look like winners too.  My play is weak, but I guess I was hoping to strike a third time, get some spread back.

#note I learned this word long before its anagram, which totally slipped my mind during this game.  ALTER(A)NT is much better.

#note Best.
>Amnon_Igra: AELRS 12B LASER +28 126
#note Oddly, this play doesn't even show up in the top 10.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGILLN 12J LING. +18 316
#note Good way to bleed spread when ahead: setup an X hotspot.  Better choices: just LE(Y) for 12, with no sim.
>Amnon_Igra: CKU 8A CUK. +30 156
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEFLO C2 LEAF +21 337
#note B10 FE(L)LOE 34.  Or just FE(L)LA is fine, too.
>Amnon_Igra: AWX 11I WAX +46 202
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDEIOZ E3 ZED +43 380
#note O13 BIZ 48 is 5 more.  10I AB 27 keeping DEIOZ is another cool alternative.  C10 DI(A)ZO is neat, but why open a lane?
>Amnon_Igra: EFST B10 FE.TS +32 234
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCHIIO 13G OBIA +11 391
#note Biggest miss of the game, but I guess I was trying to shut down the bottom.  Playing a bit more conservatively than I normally would, as I've found it's a good way to lose spread and lose games if you don't.  O13 HIC 31, though.  DUH.
>Amnon_Igra: RR H13 .RR +15 249
>Ryan_Fischer: ACHIOTY 15H .OACH +14 405
#note HOY O13 34, which I saw.  I wanted to close off longshot bingos through the R, though.  Maybe a bit too defensive.
>Amnon_Igra: MOT O13 MOT +21 270
#note Wholly shit!  Betcha can't find my star play.  Betcha Cappelletto couldn't find the star play!  :)
