#note Q likes it on bottom, which makes sense holding the O.

#note both of us thought this one was good.  SURA, SURAH and SURRA, but not SURRAH*.  All of these have different definitions.
>Brett_H: EIILOST J4 IOLITES +75 111
#note the other positioning is better, because it minimizes comebacks.

#note  I spent a lot of time on this play.  there were 5 or 6 really good options that I was considering, including ZA for 49, ZAIRE for 48, FRIEZE for 44, FEZ for 30.  I took FRIEZE because of the turnover and leave I thought justified the 5 point drop.  The problem is it gives up a lot to comebacks, which really obviates the advantages.  Take the points, maintain control.  ZA is the play.

#note Q likes OUTBUY, but it probably depends on the leave.

#note If I had known GERMEN I would have played it.

#note Q likes EIGhTvO, but that's sort of a hard find with both blanks.

#note I almost didn't play this.  The comebacks are probably huge, but if I play iNK leaving [EINRS], and it gets blacked up, I am forced to try to find something through the D which probably won't work out.  I felt like I had to play the bingo and pray he either a) didn't have the F, or b) we are able to exchange plays on the triple line.  Any thoughts?

#note not best, but it scores and I didn't think he had an out play.
