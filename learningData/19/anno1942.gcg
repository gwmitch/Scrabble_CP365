>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEENU -EEU +0 0
#note Best.
>Jason_R_Sommer: MUV 8G VUM +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEHNTT H8 .NHATTEd +83 83
#note also ETcHANT or EArTHN(U)T, though this is best.
>Jason_R_Sommer: DEGIO F6 GEOID +24 40
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFPRRU E4 FRAP +25 108
#note Best, save leaving the F by the DWS.
>Jason_R_Sommer: DEIJNO D6 JOINED +31 71
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEOPRU 15A PREBOUn. +89 197
#note Booyah.  Sweet sassy molassy!  (Also UnPROBE(D), its anagram, and UPBORnE, which I was unsure of but saw, too.)
>Jason_R_Sommer: DEEY -  +0 71
#note Count it!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEKNSSU D1 KUNE +36 233
#note Best unless you see ANKUSES.  The funny thing is, there was this situation where ANKUSH came up, but I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on this one.
>Jason_R_Sommer: DEEY 1D .EYED +39 110
>Ryan_Fischer: AAERSSW C10 WARS +22 255
#note Weak play.  Had trouble departing with one S.  Couldn't figure what else to do with it.  Best is apparently AWA 14B; C9 AWARE loses everything but the Ses.
>Jason_R_Sommer: NOY 8A YON. +21 131
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEORS C3 ODE +19 274
#note Whoops, missed SEADRO(M)E.  Hard to see, sure.  I mistakenly once played SEADRONE* a long time ago.  Didn't really think to look for anything with the EEO combo.
>Jason_R_Sommer: EI H1 .IE +4 135
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEIRS 10H .AE +8 282
#note Time for the ballad of the dueling fishermen.
>Jason_R_Sommer: IO E11 OI +12 147
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILORS I8 .O. +9 291
>Jason_R_Sommer: IL I3 LI +6 153
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILRSU 13F LI.U +6 297
#note I had had enough already of all these promising no-go racks, but clearly this is wrong.  But how long do I keep fishing here, especially when there aren't many scoring moves to be had?
>Jason_R_Sommer: AEINNRT K8 ENTRAIN +71 224
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGRSS 15K SARGE +29 326
#note Kay, enough is enough.
>Jason_R_Sommer: CFT 12J F.CT +18 242
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAIIMS N9 AMIA +22 348
#note Whoops.  FACTA*.  He wasn't even paying much attention at that point.  I kinda knew it was fishy, but it opened up a juicy spot, which means it was just doubly stupid on my part.
>Jason_R_Sommer: XZ 9M Z.X +29 271
#note Lucky he couldn't do more damage with that.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHILORS O6 HOA. +42 390
#note Just LO is 40, over the top, making LAMIA and AX.  HAIRS is a pretty good leave, making it possible I might bingo again.  Possible given the pool and the HAIRS leave is SCRAIGH, ARCHILS/CARLISH, LARGISH, ATHIRST/RATTISH/TARTISH, and TRISHAW/WRAITHS.
>Jason_R_Sommer: CGL B6 CL.G +13 284
#note Well, not if he clogs it up like that, lolz.
>Ryan_Fischer: BILQRSV B1 QIS +27 417
#note Drek.

>Jason_R_Sommer:  (V) +8 320
#note So yeah, I was feeling pretty good about myself after that game.  Sure I drew fairly well, but also played well, except for the end when I got sloppy.
