#note Should be SOX, but that's such a stupid word.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: INTW 11D TWIN +25 53
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDNOTV I6 BAD +22 63
#note Don't like setting up the Y hotspot, and VAT is probably better.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: LOO 12C LOO +15 68
#note Oh great, one of these boards.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAENOTV J2 NOVAE +18 81
#note 13B VANE is fine, but OVA is a nice balancing play, especially with the N in hand.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ADIOR 13C AROID +29 97
#note Nice play, but this parallel shit is getting tiresome. :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ARRTTW I1 TAW +21 102
#note Missed sTARW(O)RT 3E 65.  This play really messed up the game for me too.  I have these 8s lines to work with, which I love, and then I go and muck it up instead of exchanging (or -- heh -- actually finding the bingo already there).
>Jack_Eichenbaum: DEEY 14B EYED +34 131
#note This move kinda annoyed me.  Sets up a race situation for the K, S, and Y, which is never fun, and further crazifies* the board.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEORRT K6 gARROTE +66 168
#note Hated this play, couldn't find the 2x2s.  Bleh.  RELATOR, REALTOR, REACTOR, AERATOR.  No excuse, really.  4th game of the day, though.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: NOTU H1 UNTO +30 161
>Ryan_Fischer: EHNOQRT J9 OH +28 196
#note I played OH 'cause I didn't want to kill the E line, hoping to draw a U or something to score with the Q on the next turn.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: MPR 12J P.RM +16 177
>Ryan_Fischer: EILNQRT -Q +0 196
#note Totally blanked on QI at 13I.  Best laid plans, though.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: AEKLY A11 LEAKY +52 229
#note Hatemylifehatemylifehatemylife... (sorry, must be something in my throat)
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILNRT 8K .ELIT +18 214
#note I play this, trying to be a little more aggressive.  He's just made a star play, leaving 2, so how am I supposed to know he's drawn in to any number of 8s (well, actually just ONE -_-).  I'm not gonna continue fishing like Quackle suggests...
>Jack_Eichenbaum: EEGINNR O6 EN.ERING +60 289
#note Le sigh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EFHNRU N6 HE.R +32 246
#note I immediately see UNFREsH*(! -- why isn't that good?), and curse the fact that I killed the S hook with (R)ELIT last turn.  UH N5 appears to be fine.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: FGIU 4D FUGI. +18 307
#note That was kind of him.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?FLNUUV F2 FU.U +16 262
#note From bad to worse... maybe I should've exchanged here?  I like taking the points, creating a new hook in case he gets to the S down low first.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: IQ 3C QI +27 334

#note Best.  At least I got something right this game.  Oddly enough, the Champ says to play G(L)IA M7 21.  I don't have the new Quackle with inference, so I can't tell you how this does.  JAMBS is going down no matter what, so perhaps something like lINAGES 6A might be better.  6A GAmINES is the first bingo the Champ picks to play.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: ABDEJMS 6B JAMBS +45 406
#note I don't wanna play anymore.  Can I just take my ball and go?
>Ryan_Fischer: ACELV 4J .ALVE +22 358
#note At least I got this one right.
>Jack_Eichenbaum: DE O3 ED +20 426
>Jack_Eichenbaum:  (C) +6 432
#note It gets better from here.  However briefly.  Honest!  :)
