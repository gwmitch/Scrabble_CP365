>Jesse_Day: AAEELRS 8G AE +4 4
#note in retrospect, it seems clear that this is the wrong placement. It should go to the right for the simple reason that that way AE can't be hooked for an easy score and hi a triple letter score. As far as I can tell, that's also why your three tile openers are almost always supposed to go in the middle unless you can come up with a real good reason why not. However, besides that the best play is exchanging the A anyway, says quackle; I have my doubts because joe's clearly going to play differently than he would normally after that, but I suppose the bingos tend to score a few more points after the exchange versus after AE.
>Joe_Edley: EKX F8 KEX +37 37
>Jesse_Day: AEELORS 7G AREOLES +65 69
#note I think that I might have not realized that the AE had suddenly become hookable, and thus missed the better placement.
>Joe_Edley: BDILRU L6 R.BUILD +26 63
#note I wonder what his leave was; this play took him a while. maybe an r?
>Jesse_Day: BCGGMRY J6 M.GGY +26 95
#note lucky he didn't block my spot. I wasn't 100% sure on BOGGY, and this rack would be completely disastrous if I have my play challenged off, so I went with MOGGY instead. Ironically, after I drew my tiles Joe muttered that he should've held the play, which made me worry that it was just MOGGIE (they're both good). The other irony is that this slightly substandard play ends up winning me the game!
>Joe_Edley: ?IILTTU -?IILT +0 63
>Jesse_Day: BCDEIRS E9 BED +25 120
#note Hoping Joe would give me a spot for SCRIBED, or an A or an E (didn't think of the U, probably would've seen it). Instead I was left with a pretty tough decision - fish, or take some points?  Here's the surprise - dropping the C at H9 is so good that exchanging the C is the second best move! It wouldn't occur to me, but BDEIRS is actually a fantastic fishing rack - it hits all the vowels and a whole bunch of consonants, and the bingo would be essentially unblockable (although I wasn't 100% on SMOGGY...moe on that later). Quackle says that I bingo next turn 82% of the time after REC.
>Joe_Edley: EHNW D10 HEWN +36 99
>Jesse_Day: ACIORSW C11 WAIR +30 150
#note avoiding the temptation to play CHEX. This is a pretty useful play as far as setting up opportunities.
>Joe_Edley: ?AACERT B9 TRAChEA +92 191
#note wow! probably the best find against me all tournament.
>Jesse_Day: CDIORSV 13F CORVIDS +79 229
#note alright, here's where the question of SMOGGY becomes relevant. SMOGGY sounds great to me. But if I play  up there and he somehow challenges it off, then my bingo isn't going down and the situation is looking rather dire. So I had to pass up the points to make sure that the bingo gets down. It might just be because it was joe edley, but I would probably just play SMOGGY against most players.
>Joe_Edley: Z 15A Z. +33 224
>Jesse_Day: EILMNOS 5D LOMEINS +81 310
#note of course, this time I pull my second bingo in a row out of the bag, and I have no choice but to try SMOGGY after all! He didn't even hold - because it was good, of course. See how everything would've been different if I'd played boggy?
>Joe_Edley: ELNTU 4A UNLET +18 242
>Jesse_Day: DIOPTTU A3 O.TPUT +24 334
#note the good fortune continues. also PUTOUT! Quackle's favorite is PUTRID through the R, but wih this very closed board it made much more sense to block the easiest way for him to win the game.
>Joe_Edley: EFO H12 F.OE +33 275
>Jesse_Day: ADEIIJO K11 AI.ED +21 355
#note took me a long time to think of this, but I think that it's the best block available, burning four tiles and scoring decently. I almost like having the J as a blocking tile. and if he bingo through the E and D, well, props.
>Joe_Edley: OTT 8L .OTT +20 295
>Jesse_Day: EIIJNOV O4 JOIN. +20 375
#note I just don't get it, quackle. is JOINT really that bad? quackle seems to like play DEVON/DOVEN at the bottom right. But why? CONJOINT and DISJOINT are both gone. I like my play.
>Joe_Edley: HPY G2 HYP. +16 311
#note more interesting than meets the eye, in that he had the U in hand, and part of the intent of this play is to potentially hit a really big bingo if I play QI. Too bad for him I didn't have the Q, because I might not have thought about it hard enough.
>Jesse_Day: AEGIIOV H1 VIA +28 403
#note even with the blank out the V is pretty safe - only two bingos in the pool, VARIANTS and VANQUISH (not that I saw either of them at the time) and only the latter will win him the game. that would've hurt.
>Joe_Edley: AFNQRSU 14J F. +26 337
>Jesse_Day: EGINOQS 6N Q. +31 434
#note joe has a decent rack, but I went through the alphabet and couldn't come up with anything at either spot. Actually, I think I just looked at the V, figuring that dropping the Q would outrun a bingo from the T anyway, and that none were readily apparent. dropping the Q is actually wrong, though - better is to play DOGIE from the D, which prevents him from setting up a high point out-in-two (DRAIN followed by tAU), leaves two spots for the Q, and requires some very tricky plays from him to keep the spread close (specifically, burning the blank to play pREBUILDS and pRAO, and then going out with UNAI).
>Joe_Edley: ?AAINRU 15K .RAIN +21 358
>Jesse_Day: EGINOS O4 .....ING +16 450
#note under time pressure, but actually best.
>Joe_Edley: ?AU 14M tAU +11 369
>Joe_Edley:  (EOS) +6 375
#note Another game where I didn't get to leave a note. The last time I played Joe Edley was two and a half years ago at the Dallas Open, where missing GUENONS might've ended up costing me a shot at the game, though it was still close anyway. Really, though, this ended up being as unspectacular game as I had at nationals - I was lucky at the crucial middle of the game and I played well enough to stint a potential comeback.
