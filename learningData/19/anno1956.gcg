#note D8 FATAL. I'd been told that Pakorn plays phonies, and there's always the chance it was a SOWPODS word, etc etc. I wish I knew words better. [-30]

#note H1 ORZO is very close. I think it might be better since it kills the AB hook up top. [-0.3]

#note here i notice i have a great shot at an I for INFOLDING. N1 DON though turns over one more and keeps a little more balanced of a leave, and it may also scare the opp into playing there.

#note i only had two seconds, and i misplayed CEDE i.e. missed the squares, so we called the director. she said the tiles needed to be in the squares rather than on top of them. but since pakorn didn't have a play, he passed, i just went again, MISSED again, and the third time i finally got the tiles in the squares.
