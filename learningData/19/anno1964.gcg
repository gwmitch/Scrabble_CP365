>Steve_Glass: DIOOV 8H OVOID +22 22
>Cesar: GLNOOUZ J7 G.NZO +35 35
#note [-5] I shoulda put a little more thought into this move. J8 OUZO is definitely better.
>Steve_Glass: ?AOPSUY M2 PAYOUtS +82 104
>Cesar: EFKLOOU 4H FLUKE. +40 75
#note you can see my mind starting to deteriorate that final day. i should be able to find L1 KOLO. [-4]
>Steve_Glass: AEGIRU 10G GAU.IER +17 121
>Cesar: AGOOQRR H1 GOO. +24 99
#note this rack is annotated funny.. i pointed an arrow to the Q and underlined it repeatedly with a question mark. don't lose your cool cesar! this one is just barely above ROOF.
>Steve_Glass: ?CJMNTU 11I T.N +12 133
>Cesar: ADQRRTW 2J WRA.T +36 135
>Steve_Glass: L L2 .L. +5 138
#note god
>Cesar: CDEQRWX 6K CR.X +29 164
#note someone needs to tell me what i'm doing wrong. is this a clear exchange rack? do i take the 29 and suffer another turn? i don't know. this never works out for me because 30 doesn't outrun another bingo.. i just barely caught up, and he's fishing, he's gonna hit it. i dunno.
>Steve_Glass: ACEINRT 1A REACTIN. +92 230
>Cesar: DEHINQW E1 .WINED +20 184
#note D1 CHINED is FAR better.  I saw it and somehow chickened out on it. [-4] also, exchanging HQW sims right below it by win percentage. again, do i just dump the Q now?
>Steve_Glass: DIJ 4B DJI. +24 254
>Cesar: BDFHPQR -BDFHPQ +0 184
#note lol!! keeping PR is a little better. or DR.
>Steve_Glass: AELOS 12E ALOES +9 263
>Cesar: AENRRTY E11 R.Y +12 196
#note B4 DRY has the biggest win %.. i don't like it that much. i guess i can infer that he has another S. L10 EYRA is almost right behind it, i like this move. my move is decent. i think. [-3]
>Steve_Glass: FL 13C FL. +18 281
>Cesar: AEEINRT D4 .NERTIAE +66 262
#note and then i go and play a STUPIDASS move. yes, i set up the RAYA hook, but i thought i didn't wanna open up a triple. but i'm opening up three! and worse of all, there are two Hs unseen. i even realized this when i laid down the move, but shrugged and said whatever. that's no way to focus! [-1.3]
>Steve_Glass: HIM F6 HIM +31 312
>Cesar: BEEENQS 9C Q. +21 283
>Steve_Glass: AEST 14B TEAS +22 334
>Cesar: ABEEENS 11M EN +4 287
#note i spent forever on this. what a horrible situation. M10 RANEE sims best, i kind of like it i guess. i dunno. it's going for the blank. [-21] 12K NABE is also interesting. 15A BANS just goes all out for it.. maybe i could V stick him or something?
>Steve_Glass: OPT 12M TOP +13 347
>Cesar: ABEEISU 14B ....E +7 294
#note this is clearly desperation. RETIE M10. TEASE is down by [1.5]% if he can't find a way to block with the V maybe... B4 DIE also. i don't see how i'm gonna win the game either way.
>Steve_Glass: DEV 15F DEV +24 371
>Cesar: ?ABEISU O12 .UB +7 301
#note i was so angry after this blank. i was too low on time to see anything fancy. 15A dAUB clearly. [-37]
>Steve_Glass: ABHIM 15A BAH +35 406
>Cesar: ?AEIS 15K AmIES +36 337
