#note J00cron: I should have placed this differently- I forgot the extension.
>Player1: CFJKOOU 8A JOO....... +72 72
#note Jinjerj00: I just learned this tonight!  JOOFUCKS just wasn't as cool.
>Player2: IJNOOWZ G7 I.WNZJOO +85 171
#note J00cron: I saw the second J and said "What the hell?"  But then I realized this is the lowest prob bingo I've ever played!
>Player1: CFKLLOU J1 LOLFUCK. +75 147
>Player2: AIPYZZZ 11E PI.ZAZZY +246 417
#note JOOcron: ZZZ at 15G seemed like the obvious play, but then I realized there was another Z.  Where did all these Z's come from?
>Player1: BBFOORY E7 B.BY.ROOF +71 218
#note Jinjerj00: I knew that by turning over seven tiles, I maximized my probability of drawing the four tiles for the front extension.  Can you find it?
>Player2: ?CCFLOO 14B LOC.F.CO +46 463
#note J00cron: I didn't know if it took an S, and with such a big lead, I didn't want to get greedy.
>Player1: ADDEEEE E3 DEAD......... +54 272
#note JinjerJ00: And wouldn't you know, I drew it!  But it's going to be hard to catch up with that leave.

#note J00cron: I can't score anything with these!

#note Jinjerj00: I'm back in the game!
>Player2: AEEIOUU 15I EUOUAE +9 472
#note J00cron: Luckily, I still had my emergency Sowpods play at hand.
>Player1: LOOSSTV O9 VOLOSTS +104 525
#note Jinjerj00: Much more defensive than STOLOVS.
>Player2: DIIILTV L4 LIVIDIT. +84 556
#note J00cron: I was just livid with these I's.  Now now, take that, I's.
>Player1: ACEEITV O1 .EACTIVE....... +128 653
#note JinjerJ00: I wasn't 100% sure, but it sounded right.  He held me on it for about a week.  We had to continue the game at a later date.
>Player2: AINNNNU A5 NIN.ANUN +66 622
#note J00cron: I learned this word from my mistress.  She has to sneak out of the convent to be with me.
>Player1: ADGHNRX 15A HAX +50 703
#note JinjerJ00: The clear strategic winner.
>Player2: ADEEGRT -  +0 622
#note J00cron: Stupid auto-pass rules.

#note J00cron: Giving myself a slim chance to stay in the game.
>Player1: AEGINRR 13I RANGE +18 752
#note JinjerJ00: I knew I had mistracked, but there was no way he could possibly bingo on this board.  I thought I had it all wrapped up.  By the time it was over, I knew it was time to part ways with tournament Scrabble.
>Player2: ??????? 4D t.acup.u.s +62 747
#note J00cron: Thank god she missed all my bingos!  I saw ion(O)sond(E) at 2G for one more point, but it seemed so much cooler to play a ten.
