>Jesse_Day: AABDERT H4 TEAB.ARD +62 62
#note Spent a very long time thinking about TABARDED, especially because I thought he might challenge, but when I found TEABOARD it wasn't worth risking a word I wasn't sure about.
>Mike_Baker: EEFHRXY -  +0 10
#note whoa, and the challenge! didn't see that one coming.
>Jesse_Day: ?EEGLNU 4C UnGEN.LE +66 128
#note I guess it's just been too long since I've seen LUNGEES. He actually held me on this one too.
>Mike_Baker: ?AEIJRT F6 JA.nTIER +82 92
#note ok, can't get too comfortable...
>Jesse_Day: AAHNSST 12D HA.TS +31 159
#note I wanted to find a play like this, but it took me forever to do it. At least I got there eventually.
>Mike_Baker: MNOY I6 MO.Y +32 124
>Jesse_Day: AADNSSX J6 AX +30 189
#note could play SAX at 3A, but what's the point?
>Mike_Baker: EIIIMRR 13A MIRIE. +23 147
#note mike told me his rack here.
>Jesse_Day: ADLNOSS J9 SOLANDS +70 259
#note hurray for studying!

>Jesse_Day: DFIILRV L2 L.VID +18 302
#note LIVID wins out in a sim because the V is really really bad on this board. quackle's competitors are FLIR at 2K, which is stupid, and VID at B6. I guess I liked playing at L2 just to clamp down on that part of the board some.
>Mike_Baker: EEILNST M5 TENSILE +64 280
#note missing LISENTE at N1, but passing up SETLINE and the plays on row 2 from what he said.
>Jesse_Day: IINRRWY L11 WIRY +25 327
#note wish there were something better do here...sure felt like I was floundering at the time.
>Mike_Baker: EH 11E H.E. +30 310
>Jesse_Day: ABINOPR 8K OP.IN +30 357
#note too close to pass up the points of OPSIN, and every other scoring play gives back a lot more. then again, this is the kind of move where I take things for granted and end up being completely wrong, so what should I do?
>Mike_Baker: NOO 5C NOO +15 325
#note seemingly missing ONO at K11. Maybe he missed the spot, maybe he wanted to make it harder for me to block that lane on row 2, but this may have cost him the game...
>Jesse_Day: ABEGGRT C3 B..G +14 371
#note A supertough move where my choice is most likely not right. I guess this is my thinking: by playing off my two worst tiles (though maybe playing IGG is better on that front) I make sure that if he bingos he has to pick up three tiles, and if he had the tiles to bingo he will very likely pick up the junk out of the bag. But I think that's also a bad assumption because if he has the Z he can just dump it and be down 22 with two in the bag and two lanes still in place. The funny thing is that my play evidently does best against his actual following play, which is either a fortuitous coincidence or a sign that I chose a play that responds to bingos well. What do y'all say?
>Mike_Baker: CEEOPRU 2D RECOUPE +77 402
#note nice play, mike! held him for a minute or so even though I knew it was good just to figure out the endgame...interesting to note is that given my next draw the pool before my play was FKOVZ, which maybe confirms my analysis from when I played BUNG.

>Mike_Baker: FKZ 5K Z.. +24 426
>Jesse_Day: AG 14L .AG +14 417
>Jesse_Day:  (FK) +18 435
#note It didn't necessarily feel like I played that well at the time because of the lack of better alternatives, but quackle says that this ranks up with my best-played games at nationals from an equity perspective. I'm not sure that that's necessarily true, though, because I made two mistakes: playing the wrong bingo with UNGENTLE, and then BUNG, which is most definitely up for discussion. The rest of it just came very easily. Hopefully I would be able to hold that level of play up for the rest of the day...
