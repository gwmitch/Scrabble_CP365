#note the 8E placement is simming better by a tiny bit. [-0.1]

#note the same word at 3H sims a lot better. i don't like putting the E there. [-7.5]

#note winterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
>Cesar: BIIORUU -BIIUU +0 42
#note 8A BIRO is preferred by quackle. yuck! but now that i see how much it scores, i gotta take the points. [-12]

#note honestly i have no idea what a LYCOPENE is, and although it is a very nice find, i didn't think it took an S. the original word only seemed very vaguely familiar. it sounds like an adjective. like pliocene or something. i probably shouldn't have challenged. 1L APOD is the move. [-27]
>Winter: BU 1M .UB +21 274
>Cesar: ADEIORT 3M .O +2 150
#note N1 UDO is preferred, but i'd really like to keep the D for FEUD. [-4]
>Winter: MNR 3J M.N..R +14 288
>Cesar: ADEIPRT 11G DIPTERA +78 228
>Winter: BDR M10 B.RD +14 302
>Cesar: AHLOSYZ N8 HOY +32 260
#note here i notice i can draw an R for IZARS if i keep ZAS on my rack. with three unseen Rs this is likely. however, i can probably infer that Winter kept an R when he did BARD, so my chances are less likely. i thought of this but being so far down i still thought it was a good idea. the problem is that HOY just gives too much back, necessitating me to definitely draw the R next turn. B12 HAZY is simming best although it seems a little nuts. the leave would be ok if  draw an E T R something. [-10] RASHLY O3 is also tied, and this is also a nice move.
>Winter: EIRT O7 TIRE +37 339
#note now there's only one R to draw...
>Cesar: ADLNSUZ H1 UND. +15 275
#note yet i'm still holding on to the Z like a jackass. just play H1 AZLON and move on!! [-13]
>Winter: GIU 13J GUI. +6 345
>Cesar: AELNSTZ N8 ...LE +24 299
#note just ONE more try. if winter has the F then so be it, but this gives me a shot at an F AND one of the two remaining Rs. come on! still M7 ZA gives me a good shot at a bingo. [-5.5]
>Winter: AALNOOR -  +0 345
#note i certainly was not expecting a challenge! he just challenged DIPTERAL. it's amusing because i just saw a wiegand game where he challenged TRIPEDAL. did you skip this set, winter? :)
>Cesar: AFHNSTZ O12 FATS +43 342
#note and i drew the F, and i screwed it up! FASH cesar! i do not remember thinking of this word. maybe i don't know it that well. i was also fairly low on time now (about 3 minutes maybe). [-9] even FANS is better, (trying to figure out why -- is HTZ that much better than HNZ? something special on this board i'm missing?)
>Winter: AKR D9 .ARK +20 365
#note key move #1
>Cesar: EHLNNOZ 2F ZO.E +33 375
#note i used up most of my remaining three minutes on this endgame move. B12 HON wins 32% of the time, whereas my move wins a dismal 1.7%. [-30.5]
>Winter: AILOSTW 13B WAST +25 390
>Cesar: AAHLNNO 7J H.LO +13 388
#note hah -- and this is that 1.7% of the time! i've miraculously managed to draw two As, and in the couple of minutes it took Winter to make his move, i considered HALAZONE and quickly dismissed it. NOOO! bad cesar. i STILL have like three other ways to win. winter only has outs on 6K VIRL or 7J RAIL.  [-14] if i play 6I NAVAL, then i go out with 14A NOH or 14I NOH. (BUT NAVAL gives him 7J LARI to go out! would he find this in a few seconds?) one of the things i need to do is in a tense situation like this when i'm low on time (i had about 30 secs when he hit the clock, but i did have a couple of minutes extra with the board upside down) i need to go into hyperfocus mode somehow and FIND these things. still this is definitely chalked up to a word mistake -- i did study almost all the Z bingos, and HALAZONE definitely triggered that memory, but just not enough.
