>Sam: ILNORSS 8D LIONS +12 12
#note After 6000+ 2-ply iterations, Quackle bafflingly likes LOINS and NOILS better. NOILS I understand (O is worse than I for double-doubles, right?), but LOINS sets up the A and E hooks I don't possess! He must have been wondering what sort of rack I had with an opener like LIONS.

>Sam: EEGILRS 4C REELI.GS +68 98
#note CLERGIES!!! I need to have studied words like this! It's a whole different game if I find and play CLERGIES. First FEINTED against Ed, now this...it's like I have an aversion to common words.
>Jeff_Reeves: ?ADEINP 1A PEDANtI. +89 190
>Sam: JMOQRRT 6B JO +30 128
#note MOR 2B might be better. Didn't want to play through this junk, but I think it was the right thing to do.
>Jeff_Reeves: IV J2 VI. +14 204
#note Already shutting down the board.
>Sam: DMQRRTW -MQRTW +0 128
#note What's best to keep here? R? MR? M?
>Jeff_Reeves: BEKR 3B KERB +30 234
>Sam: DDENORT 9B ROD +9 137
#note Gotta make something happen on this board. He probably doesn't have a T, right? 
>Jeff_Reeves: AQT A7 QAT +41 275
#note Right.
>Sam: DEEHNTX 2J .EXED +32 169
#note I angrily slapped this down, but noticed the better EXTEND a few moments later, which was upsetting. I was letting a poor opening day and frustrating game get to me, which should never happen. VEXED isn't too poor though, it at least opens the board somewhat.
>Jeff_Reeves: NU 3L UN +17 292
#note Shutting down everything.

>Sam: FFLNOWZ --  -54 264
#note Tying it up! Or not...confused this with EFFLUX, apparently. Just one of this tourney's many phonies. Something like AZON E10, maybe?

>Sam: AAFGLMT 10L TA +5 343
#note I was extremely proud of this play. Down 43, this looks like a hopeless situation. But if I draw IN (not super-unlikely with IIN unseen), I threaten FLAMING N7 and FLAMINGO 13A simultaneously! Even his best play of UPTIME N9 would lose by 3 to FLAMINGO!
>Jeff_Reeves: AEIINPT N10 PINITE +39 420
#note Jeff's best play. He really played this game well, from my vantage point.
>Sam: AFGLMMU 15L FU.L +33 376
#note GUMMA O6, a word I didn't know, is best.
>Jeff_Reeves: A J14 .A +11 431
#note Capping off my fourth loss of the first day, a disappointment to me. 4-3 was my bottom goal, and I really wanted 5 to start off. I knew I'd have to make up ground, but I didn't really until Day 4.
