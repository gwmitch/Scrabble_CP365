>Jesse_Day: CDEIOOR 8G COO +10 10
#note I find that I've been playing shorter on the openings lately when there's not a dominant play - maybe influenced by quackle too much, but I simply would rather give my opponent less to work with. COOED and COO are about even in a sim. Does this mean I'm becoming a defensive player?
>Alyssa_Faria: GIJ 7I JIG +36 36
>Jesse_Day: ?DEILRS K4 wER.ILDS +86 96
#note yay best bingo!
>Alyssa_Faria: EEHL 9H HEE. +24 60
>Jesse_Day: EINQTWW -QWW +0 96
#note qww were first out of the bag on this draw, and back they go. Sorry, quackle, I don't want to play WINE here.
>Alyssa_Faria: ES L6 ES +16 76
#note the first wacky move in what would become an increasingly crazy looking game.
>Jesse_Day: AEINPRT 11D PANTRIE. +70 166
>Alyssa_Faria: AEFLM 12A FLEAM +40 116
#note don't know how to explain it, but whenever I play alyssa she just always seems to be full of really great, creative high-scoring nonbingos, aside from all the cool bingos she knows. wonder what the 7th tile was (assuming 6th was the S)
>Jesse_Day: INPQTTW 13C TWIN +31 197
#note QW returns!
>Alyssa_Faria: DEELOTU -DEEL +0 116
#note given the pattern so far, she should bingo after this exchange...
>Jesse_Day: EPQTTTZ 6J P..Z +31 228
#note EQTTT isn't going anywhere fast, but with a big lead I would much rather take the points.
>Alyssa_Faria: EESX L4 EX.. +33 149
>Jesse_Day: EFQTTTW -FQTTW +0 228
#note QW strikes again! the static evaluator likes the cheerfully psycho WEFT at M1 by a mile, but is that really enough points to keep QTT AND give her an E to work with?
>Alyssa_Faria: RUY A12 .URY +30 179
>Jesse_Day: AELOTVV 3L VAV +33 261
#note what a weird game for draws. VAV happens to play very nicely indeed, but I'm a little bit concerned about the potential for the S hook, which could end up being very hard to block.
>Alyssa_Faria: DN M2 D.N +6 185
#note alyssa cleverly capitalizes on my worries. Actually, VAV is a little bit wacky to begin with because I know she has the S from earlier.
>Jesse_Day: AEKLOOT 10E KOA +25 286
#note if only KEV were still good!
>Alyssa_Faria: BDFINOY -BDF +0 185
#note I believe she said that she threw the Q back here, which would make the third time it had been drawn so far this game.
>Jesse_Day: EELNOTU N1 LE. +18 304
#note a tough rack to have on this board, but quackle likes my play, which reduces the danger of the S - although more words start with the S than any other letter. quackle's other plays are ROUTE and ROUEN, neither of which is very satisfying.
>Alyssa_Faria: AINORUY -AI +0 185
#note yikes!
>Jesse_Day: EGINOTU 14F OUTING +15 319
#note I really thought hard about something like ON or OE to neutralize the S entirely, but I didn't follow through when I really, really should've. Other than hitting the Y for a bingo, there's very few ways for her to get back in this game save a big scoring S bingo on the far right, making this a really bad mistake.
>Alyssa_Faria: ACEIMST O3 SEMATIC +96 281
#note surprise!
>Jesse_Day: DDEHNSY 15C DYED +17 336
#note just trying to take out big plays on the triple, which are just about all that's left on this board, but the right way to do it is to play NTH or EDH. NTH has the additional bonus of blocking a QI play or a huge QUA__ play which would possibly give her the lead....pretty angry I didn't think of NTH at the time.
>Alyssa_Faria: AEIOQRU 13I QI +44 325
#note bam. I try not to get frustrated, but I was pretty furious at myself after allowing this one.
>Jesse_Day: AEHNORS 15K OH +12 348
#note I thought about NOH, but I really liked OH because if she blcks I at least score 24 on the triple, and NOH doesn't allow me to do that. But quackle thinks that OH gives too much back - in the sim alyssa averages 12 points for her next move after NOH! I still like OH.
>Alyssa_Faria: AOTU M12 AUTO +14 339
>Jesse_Day: ?AEENRS 15H AS +24 372
#note why I was so happy with OH to begin with. What a ridiculous draw, again! I feel bad for Alyssa, because I really had to luck out down the stretch to win this one.
>Alyssa_Faria: ABBFLRT 12L B.RF +26 365
>Jesse_Day: ?EENRRT O12 .ERN +21 393
#note what else? quackle has some wacky ideas but they lose in the sim.
>Alyssa_Faria: ABGILOW 14M .O. +6 371
>Jesse_Day: ?AEORTW 10K .REW +16 409
#note not sure where my initial annotation went, but this is a rack where I should clearly fish off the W. there's no endgame that I lose by fishing, and I hit bingos very, very often - ANORETIC/ORIENTAL as unblockable outbingos 3/8 and she might have to block BROCATEL. That's a shot worth taking.
>Alyssa_Faria: ABGIINU B10 GU. +8 379
#note she has no blocks for my plays on the left, though I might not even have seen either TALLOL or MALTOL.
>Jesse_Day: ?ALOT A6 fLOTA +15 424
>Jesse_Day:  (ABIIN) +14 438
#note What a wacky game. I normally wouldn't say that I enjoyed such a weird, constricted board so much, but I seriously enjoyed this game because of all the unusual strategy that came up and because Alyssa gave me a real run for my money. Hopefully I'll get to play her up in Maine!
