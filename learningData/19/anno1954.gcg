>Larry_Rand: UUU -UUU +0 0
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIIRSZ 8F FRIZ +32 32
#note FIZ keeping EIRS might fare a little better in the long run.  Gives one less tile to play through and is a better leave.
>Larry_Rand: ENRT I4 NERT. +15 15
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIISSW 4C EISWEI.S +74 106
#note Serendipity.  Totally different game if he doesn't play NERT(Z).  This, too, is why the EIRS leave was so much better.  Minimizes disastrous draws such as this.
>Larry_Rand: IX F8 .IX +29 44
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINNOT E10 EON +15 121
#note INTONE/FIXT for 26 breaks up so much promise.  NONET is another option.  EON, I think, is defensive enough that the low score and good leave balance things out.
>Larry_Rand: BEVY D8 BEVY +33 77
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIINT 6F INE.TIAE +62 183
#note Heh.
>Larry_Rand: MOO 3C MOO +22 99
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACCEJN K5 J.N +20 203
#note Best, oddly.  It's rare that I've had to deal with CC on my rack.  I wonder how it'll fare.
>Larry_Rand: ILPTU G10 TULIP +22 121
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACCDET M3 ACC.pTED +76 279
#note Got my answer.  CACHETED and ACCRETED are best.
>Larry_Rand: ALNO 8K NO.AL +29 150
>Ryan_Fischer: BEILOPR 11G .PBOIL +20 299
#note PREBOIL doesn't play.  Just BLO(B) is probably fine.
>Larry_Rand: AQU H1 QUA. +39 189
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEKMRV 14B REVAM. +38 337
#note Loved that I saw this play.  It's taken me 3 days to warm up.  Bout damn time.
>Larry_Rand: DHOY J10 H.ODY +28 217
#note The Quackster says just play HOY for 30, keeping the D.  He might've wanted to keep the R line open though.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEKLORU 1H .UARK +23 360
#note This or DROUK.
>Larry_Rand: GRU 8A GRU. +21 238
>Ryan_Fischer: EGHLORT A6 LO. +4 364
#note This is where my play falls apart because I want to prevent bingos.  I really don't know how to handle this kind of situation with the blank out.  Help?  Two lanes, I just wanted to do this to take out the more potent lane.  It's between G and L.  All of the plays have 99+% win percentages, I just want to learn how to best save spread.  I was trying to save for R(U)TH 2G later, but also ROUTH, which I forgot.
>Larry_Rand: DGO 13A GOD +18 256
>Ryan_Fischer: EGHRT 2G R.TH +30 394
#note Forgot to write down my rack, a bit low on time I think.
>Larry_Rand: W L8 .W +10 266
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEFGS O5 FEE. +7 401
#note Here's a case where closing up the board really cost me.  I don't know what the balance is.  
>Larry_Rand: ADS 15G SAD +20 286
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEGS 13I A.aGES +16 417
#note Turns out the blank was one of the last tiles left, and I was worried for nothing.  EGAdS N10 19 and out.
