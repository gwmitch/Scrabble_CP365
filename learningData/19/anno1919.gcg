#note Quackle likes 7G XI 36 better, which I saw but disagree with. I personally prefer DIR as a leave to DLLRY...
>Carl: AAGGNOS I7 GAG +19 47
#note I even told myself I wasn't going to undervalue the G. AGNS is far better than ANOS, and I knew this. And yet I was determined to unload both Gs at all costs. GOA D4 is clearly the right play.
>Jesse_M: BDEIORT 10H DEORBIT +70 100
>Carl: ADENOSZ M6 ANOD.ZES +92 139
#note Poop on a stick...
>Jesse_M: BEINPVV D2 VIVE +29 129
>Carl: CFFHRWW 8L H.WF +51 190
#note Ow.
>Jesse_M: BEEINOP H10 .EPONE +36 165
#note DEBONE is better. I saw DEBONE, but for whatever reason, I talked myself out of it being good. You may smack me now.
>Carl: AACFRTW L12 WAFT +34 224
#note I was hoping for the R, but WAFT is a nice alternative.
>Jesse_M: BEIIRSU 10B BIRSE +31 196
#note My choice, despite being the highest scoring of all available, places 6th in Quackle's sim. It suggests 10A BRUISE 28 is best. In retrospect, I agree. I saw the play, but turned it down in favor of BIRSE. This is a classic example of my need to improve my strategy.
>Carl: AACJPTU G11 PUJA +48 272
>Jesse_M: CILRTTU 3C L.CIT +16 212
#note My choice comes up 5th. Highest simming play (and one I completely missed) is 14B URTIC(AN)T 32 through the AN.
>Carl: AACEQRT 2F QAT +65 337
>Jesse_M: ?DMRSTU 1G MUSTaRD +91 303
>Carl: ACEIORT 5D ..CORIATE +86 423
>Jesse_M: AEIIIOR -  +0 303
#note Beautiful! I unfortunately didn't think challenging through. My reasoning was that I was going to lose anyway if it was good, so why not challenge? If I took the time to realize EROTICA played for only 10 less points, I definitely would not have challenged. Dumb, dumb, dumb...
>Carl: DEEGNOO B8 GO.ONEE +20 443
#note The sim likes KEROGEN by about 2-3 points. I don't really understand this. While my play opens the triple, it closes down the most likely bingo lanes, specifically the E hook for LICIT and the potential large bingo at 15A. 
>Jesse_M: AEIIIOR 12A I.IA +10 313
#note I just got lazy at this point and gave up...shame on me! My choice is not even top 10. Quackle suggests changing all (which I did not consider) or playing D8 (K)E(R)RIA 22 (which I saw but passed on). Someone please teach me how to play this game...
>Carl: ?AADILS A3 DAhLIAS +85 528
#note Adding further insult to injury
>Jesse_M: EEHINOR N6 HE. +32 345
>Carl: EMNUY 4K UM +18 546
#note One of about a dozen botched endgames. With just five tiles and lots of time, you'd think I could have found the right sequence. My solution is 7 points behind Quackle. See if you can figure it out.
>Jesse_M: EINOR I12 OE +19 364
>Carl: ENY N1 YEN +25 571
>Carl:  (INR) +6 577
#note I thought this might be good for Round 1 High Game. It wasn't even in the top three.
