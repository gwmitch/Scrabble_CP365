>Ryan_Fischer: AABDMNS 8D BADMAN +28 28
#note Gonna start this one off strong.
>Paul_Izikoff: FHO 9C FOH +22 22
#note Missed it for 32.
>Ryan_Fischer: GIIMSST H2 STIGMI.S +62 90
#note He held me on this for a while, and rightfully so.  There IS, however, an 8 in that rack.
>Paul_Izikoff: AFLL 1G FALL +57 79
#note IM(A)GISTS was it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEEGIT 2E GEE. +12 102
#note Or GIE down low for 18.
>Paul_Izikoff: EITY 10B YETI +31 110
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEIRRT 11B ARTsIER +91 193
#note Best, and very happy to find it.
>Paul_Izikoff: ACINO 6F CA.ION +18 128
#note Don't know this word (ANOMIC/MANIOC, too), but it gives me a spot.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIOOOY 5J GOOEY +25 218
#note D1 spot is better.
>Paul_Izikoff: AQST D1 QATS +52 180
#note I'm still surprised by what people in D2 don't know that they probably should.  AGEE is an adverb, like AJEE.  Maybe he thought I didn't know.
>Paul_Izikoff: AQST --  -52 128
>Ryan_Fischer: EIILOUU -IIOUU +0 218
#note Should've been LOUIE D1 18.  I had LOUIE set on my rack, wrote the tiles down in that order, and had just challenged off a word in the spot he just used, so there's no reason I shouldn't've seen it.
>Paul_Izikoff: AOT 4L TAO +17 145
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEILNP N2 PL.. +18 236
#note PIBAL doesn't play, which would produce the best score/leave balance given the right spot.  But BIPLANE, which I didn't see, doesn't play either.  Quackle first suggests B(OY), keeping AEILNP, which, I guess, is a very good leave, but even better if there were more lines for 8s open.  Should've seen PILEA or PLENA at 1A.  My play is okay, though.  H11 REPIN or RIPEN is an option, but why open it up?  Why does PILEA with its BN leave have a 46+ valuation when the next move PLENA only have a 4+ valuation.  Give or take.

#note :)
>Paul_Izikoff: ADER K10 DRA.E +18 245
#note Past tense of drive.  Weird form I wasn't sure about and held for a bit.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DJNOPV 3C JO.N +24 316
#note DJIN in the same spot.

#note Lemonade outta lemons.
>Paul_Izikoff: INN C3 .INN +11 289
>Ryan_Fischer: ?HIPTUW 15D WITH. +15 363
#note Sim it for a while and it creeps up to the top with WHITE, same spot, and (S)UP.  UP/YAP is also an option.
>Paul_Izikoff: KNOT 14B KNOT +23 312
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEPRUW 12B PEs +35 398
#note Took me a while, but it's best.

#note Pretty easy game, though I made some good plays.  If he didn't have the A, I'm betting he'd've challenged STIGMIAS*.  Games like this, though, are much better than the next two, where I sit and wait to go home.
