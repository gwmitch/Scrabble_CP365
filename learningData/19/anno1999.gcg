#note I guess this is the penalty for keeping a vowel-heavy leave early on.  Is there any possibility I should've just kept EN?  Set up the F, hope to draw a bingo.  A really weak play, but my best play leaves AEI, 9F NAIF 27.  Ew.  Setting up the F... yeah, when of course he had the other.  Sure, he could have the H, K, or V, but whatev.

#note No L, this is best.

#note I really wanted to play VODUNIC*, but I wasn't feeling self-destructive yet.
>Curtis_Lee: EIL O5 .ELI +18 153
>Ryan_Fischer: CEILORU D8 .OLICE +20 97
#note U(P)COIL, OILCU(P), or (P)ICUL is the winner of a lot of middling plays.  (P)OILU is interesting too.  My play, keeping RU, is just sewage.
>Curtis_Lee: ?ADEJRU N8 AbJURED +112 265
#note Not that it mattered, and not that this is ANYONE'S idea of how they wanna go out of a tourney.
>Ryan_Fischer: ENRRSUW 9C W.RN +14 111
#note Set up an S hook I actually have.  UNSEW 14B is 43!  I can't buy that as a word, which is why I didn't consider it, even though I've seen the 5s.  Lesson learned.  R(O)W 9C 12 is the sim winner, alternating with my play for first, win percentage sometimes creeping over 1%.  Whoo.  Hoo.
>Curtis_Lee: HT 3M H.T +28 293
>Ryan_Fischer: BERRSUU -RUUB +0 111
#note RUB 14D 22, but I'm finding it harder to care.  That's a secret spot anyway, and you'd think it should be exploited for more, considering what it opens.
>Curtis_Lee: IO M13 OI +11 304
#note Closin' it up.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIORSTU B9 STOURIE +76 187
#note I wish the bingo went upwards, but I guess I'll take it.
>Curtis_Lee: EST 15A T.ES +15 319
>Ryan_Fischer: AAGHMST F5 MAT..G +14 201
#note GHAT L12 28.  Don't know what my thoughts behind my play were.  Possibly open the top of the board, I guess.

>Ryan_Fischer: AHNOSUY D3 HOY +26 227
#note Holy shnikies.  (C)HANOYUS 12D 67.  HAHAHA.  Yeah, right.  One day, maybe.  Interestingly, it is a 3.5v7 (without the S), which means I have seen it in the past.  I think I'll need to see it a few more times before being able to pull it out of... uh... the aether.  Yeah, that's the ticket.  So does this mean 'cause I missed this bingo I don't get to complain about losing this one?  Heh.  Anyway, I chose to open it up up top even more, hope to get lucky with my A hook.  Not likely, but whatever, it's kamikaze time.

#note Umm... okay...
>Curtis_Lee: EKZ --  -39 342
>Ryan_Fischer: AEENOSU -UOE +0 227
#note I'm gonna cry now.  I missed AENEOUS, a word I've drilled, and PLAYED, so many times.  Wow.  I take back what I said about you playing KOE*.  Carry on.  I didn't alphabetize, I didn't think (my brain was shot), I just thought, hm, 5 vowels, there's nothing here!  My win% jumps to a little over 7% after this play, which is somewhat miraculous, given I actually make it.
>Curtis_Lee: EIKS 3C S.EIK +34 376
>Ryan_Fischer: AENNOQS F2 Q. +31 258
#note Serves me right that I throw back a bingo and draw the Q.
>Curtis_Lee: ILL H8 .ILL +4 380
#note Clenching up even more.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAENOSV K10 A.O +4 291
#note With 3 Rs and an I unseen, I still have one trick up my sleeve, fishing for RAVINES 14D 82.  Quackle has no idea what I'm doing; this play has a .01% win percentage in comparison to 2L VA(V) 18's 1.3% or H1 VAS 31.
>Curtis_Lee: GIPR L9 GRIP +30 456
#note I don't get it, 'cause I don't deserve to, and he makes a nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACENSTV 14J CAN.. +14 305
#note The champ wants VEST first, but this way, I get 'em both.  Mine sims better, at least.
>Curtis_Lee: ERRUX 12D .RUX +13 469
#note He misses the POLICERS spot with REX for 38.
>Ryan_Fischer: ESTV H1 VEST +37 342
>Ryan_Fischer:  (ER) +4 346
#note Well, this game was a headache, but missing AENEOUS, which I never thought I would (even though it's hard to see), and CHANOYUS, which I'm still having trouble spelling, makes it a little more fuzzy.  Still, bleh.
