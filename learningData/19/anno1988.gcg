#note FIG J5 works here. AGINS is much better than AINS.

>Sam: BEILRRT O5 BRI.TLER +61 172
#note TERRIBLE miss here (N7). In my defense, it's not the easiest word to find without having studied it, but that's not much of a defense at all to be honest. Luckily, Pete let this phony go after a hold.
>Peter_Armstrong: AARY N11 RAYA +18 104
>Sam: EHKNRTU H11 THUNK +50 222
#note I wrote down the plays of THUNK and HUNKIER on my scoresheet, along with their respective scores. Quackle likes HUNKIER by 4-5 points. I was influenced by Pete's last play of RAYA, which might imply an S. THUNK blocks both premier S-hooks (MAQUIS and esp. RAYAS), while HUNKIER is susceptible to huge row 15 bingoes.
>Peter_Armstrong: ACEGRST L7 C.GARETS +72 176
#note Yep, Peter did have the S.
>Sam: ELNOPRY K10 YEP +29 251
#note This is a very poor play. There's a plethora of options on the J column, and PEONY J10 is the best play. 
>Peter_Armstrong: EOP M13 OPE +27 203
>Sam: ELMNORS D4 MON +27 278
#note Apparently, I invented the word NIDOL* out of thin air. For the second time, Peter held a phony of mine but declined to challenge. 
>Peter_Armstrong: DIJ 14E DJI. +28 231
>Sam: EEILORS F14 .O +9 287
#note I was wary of plays to the TWS, and this also served as a good fish. Peter said after the game that this blocked a big play of his, something like HEEZE or ADOZE. Quackle suggests EGO M3, OILER C1, or OILED E10 which seem a little too risky with both blanks out and a sizable lead. I would consider OILED, but I still like my play best. 
>Peter_Armstrong: DEZ F2 ZED +41 272
#note Peter could never hit an A for ZA O14 49.
>Sam: EEFILRS O14 EF +21 308
#note Quackle's top play is REIFS 8A, but both blanks are out! It's way too open for my tastes at this stage. With plays like EF, I can groom my rack until Peter is forced to open.
>Peter_Armstrong: CINW 12D WINC. +26 298
>Sam: AEEILRS 11D ALE +17 325
#note WINCH may have been a clever X setup, but even if it wasn't, he may have drawn the X. I'm forced into blocking here.
>Peter_Armstrong: OU 6M OU. +5 303
>Sam: EIORSTV K3 V.. +6 331
#note ZAbAIoNE, ZENAIdAs, ZENItHAl, and ZANINEss are all possibilities (thanks, Zyz). I figured he was going for a desperation eight starting with Z, and VIS blocks all that. I also need to keep a terrific rack in case of a big play like NIXEs, HEXEs, or VEXEs to the triple for a possible outbingo. 
>Peter_Armstrong: ?EINX 8A NIXEs +42 345
>Sam: AEIORST A8 .OTARIES +77 408
#note I don't remember which five Peter pulled from the bag, but it turns out any of the seven unseen tiles (AEEHNV?) would have given me an outbingo. 
>Sam:  (?AEEHNV) +24 432
