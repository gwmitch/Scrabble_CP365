>Ryan_Fischer: ABEIRWX 8H REWAX +46 46
>Daniel_Stock: AEGV 7E GAVE +14 14
>Ryan_Fischer: BDEHISY 7K HEY +27 73
#note I sacrificed 5 points because I wanted to take out (REWAX)ING and didn't like what having EH there does to the board early on.
>Daniel_Stock: GIOT E7 .IGOT +14 28
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDIMST D4 BIMA +25 98
#note Shouldn't've missed IAMB(I).  TABID or BAM is a bit better than what I played.
>Daniel_Stock: ?EINNOR 11E .ERNIONs +64 92
#note At least it's a baby, but it's the best of the babies.
>Ryan_Fischer: DHOSTUW 9I HOW +36 134
#note Now it's okay to take this spot.
>Daniel_Stock: DO 6L DO +19 111
>Ryan_Fischer: DEERSTU H11 .UDER +21 155
#note These are the hardest racks.  No-gos or almost-ers, where you need to score but still keep your prospects open.  So I decided to open it up.  10E (O)DE scores about the same, but is more conservative.  In hindsight this is a huge error because of his fishing play.
>Daniel_Stock: AIILNRT 14F IN.RTIAL +62 173
#note And this is why you wait for your opponent to do the opening.
>Ryan_Fischer: EISSSTT 15L SITS +20 175
#note Oh, just great.  Well, may as well get rid of two of the Ses, set up a lane.
>Daniel_Stock: EFN E3 FEN +20 193
>Ryan_Fischer: BEESTTY 12A BYTES +34 209
#note BYTES was the only thing I saw that got rid of dupes and scored.  It's second, but I'll take it, really.  10D B(O)Y 29 has a really clunky leave.
>Daniel_Stock: DEMNOR 15A NORMED +39 232
#note What kind of silly word is this?  "Having a norm," Stock told me, though he admitted he wasn't sure of its validity even though it's a statistics word.  He could've played MODERN(ER) to the top TLS for 39, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEITU -  +0 209
>Daniel_Stock: AEQU C9 QUA.E +48 280
#note Ruh-oh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEITU O8 bEAUTIE. +74 283
#note Also AUdITEE(S) or EUTAxIE(S).  Cool.  Was so happy to get this down, though.
>Daniel_Stock: AGLNO N2 ALONG +29 309
#note Double ruh-oh.  Does he not know it takes a K?  Does he have the K?  Crunch time.  The K is out, which is a race situation, unless he already has it.  I have the last E, so I can hook E(QUATE).  Patterns being such as they are, it'll be a 3pt tile anchoring that hook, so I can stand to score 30 points from that play.  Not bad, not great.  JOE/EQUATE is the first option.  And in hindsight, I don't know why I didn't simply play that, other than the fact that the K worried me and it's so incredibly hard to use the K hook well ANYWAY without the E in tow.  I want that K, I want that Z.  I probably should've played JOE in hindsight, let everything else take care of itself.  It was a 20 point error not to.  A little over 1700 spins many ply of the Champ's choices shows CLOP as the winner.  Thanks, but I think I'll play CLAP 01 44, same spot, saving JOE for the next turn.  That solves the problem of the K hook, and sets me up for an easy win.  I let myself get blinded to the threat of a hook when I didn't have to, and it cost me.  Not seeing the best play, yeah, that kinda cost me too.  :)  (Also of note was PLACE(B)O, but it was worst of all those choices).
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEJLOP H2 CAJOL.. +24 307
#note So I chose this play trying to get to the K and/or Z and save the E.  Both dumb thoughts when, as I said, CLAP woulda solved my problems.
>Daniel_Stock: COZ C3 COZ +45 354
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFIKPU 1L PUKE +50 357
#note Well, I got exactly what I wanted in the K, and a monster play with it.  Dan was really low on time, so I played this REALLY quickly.  Otherwise, I would've taken my sweet time, trying to act like I wasn't sure of the play.  He held, but only for a bit, because he couldn't AFFORD to hold for too long.  Maybe something of my body language gave it away, which is something I'm trying to work on, but I guess he just figured he could still eke out a win without challenging.
>Daniel_Stock: ILPRSTV 3K VIL. +14 368
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFI O3 IF +26 383
#note Well, at least I found the Champ's best endgame play.
>Daniel_Stock: PRST 10A ST.P.R +16 384
#note But he finds a better out.
>Daniel_Stock:  (AD) +6 390
#note I go 1-3 the rest of the tournament, even stooping so low as to inadvertently play UE.  UEY# is right.  (Actually that means "U-turn", which is what I wish I could perform with respect to this game and the next four coming up (well, save the one I actually manage to win)).
