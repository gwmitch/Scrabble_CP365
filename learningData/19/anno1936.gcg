#note Would've played LIMNIC if I had thought of it, as I would prefer to keep either the M or W for plays at 15A.

>Phil: CDIILNS N10 C.LIN +26 270
#note With most of the heavy artillery spent, there's probably no reason not to play CODLIN here, which was my autopilot choice. Other plausible options include RICIN and INDRI.

#note Wish I could find a way to kill things while turning over more than three tiles, or pick up a decent score without opening new lines needlessly. But I can't, so I make a crappy little play instead. Equity-wise this play is off the charts, of course, but win%-wise it's like .2 back of roughly every other candidate.

#note Wasn't crazy about hanging onto the V here with 15L HISN, which Champ suggests is only about three points better.

#note I thought of the cute 9B ULAN, but missed the real point of the play: blocking the highly likely ZOEAE, which might be Jan's only ticket out of this game.

#note Apparently N4 AHI wins every time, but surprise-surprise I didn't have enough time to figure that out. Ordinarily I'm hesitant to play in this line late, as it encourages TWS setups for a blank/case tile, but I just couldn't visualize a worthwhile setup in this pool. Here I just wanted to guarantee V safety while forcing a possible bingo into a line that gives me big counterplay.
