#note  LLAMA is clearly best here.  Not really sure why I didn't play that.  Not a good way to start.

#note  I was proud of this one.  Cleans up an ugly rack and scores with turnover.

#note  Q likes ZIG in the same place, but I really didn't want to press my luck with the ABEO leave again.  Plus this scores a little more.  meh.

#note  not really sure what I was thinking.  I swore up and down that this one was good.  d'oh.

>Luise_Shafritz: AEEIRSW 1A .WEARIES +86 323
#note  I was about 90 % sure this wasn't good, but if I challenge, and it IS good, I'm dead in the water.  With my comeback, I even up the game against someone who I sensed wasn't the strongest player in the world.  If I can keep things pretty even, I'm going to beat her in the endgame.  This may be a little too cocky and may be playing my opponent a little bit much, but I felt pretty confident.
