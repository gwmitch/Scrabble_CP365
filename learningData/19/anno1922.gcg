#note Should've thought about this at the time, but WEEL is definitely the play - it doesn't allow the big hook and of course it doesn't take the S. It doesn't win the sim by that much, but it has to be the play given that I'm going to go up by 80 after my play.

>Jesse_Day: IINRSTV 15M .IN +19 165
#note not a bad play on its own, but I also did it because I didn't want the prospect of winter playing an S bingo to VELUMS and not being 100% on whether it took the S or not. It happens to be the besy play by a bunch anyway. What else?
>Winter: ENY M9 YEN +16 92

#note happy I found this play. The S is worth very little on this board.
>Winter: ?ACDIOR N4 pICADOR +76 204
#note holy shit!!! I don't know if winter's looked this one up, but while this is a very nice find, there's another one that would've been absolutely devastating.
>Jesse_Day: ABDEIRT 11A TRIBADE +77 294
#note get ready for this - he could've played ANDROGENETIC!! I think that's the longest word I've ever seen available in a game I've played (the previous record holder was when I missed the bingo through TRIM holding AEIMNO?)
>Winter: ADEHINU B6 UNHAI.ED +66 270
#note keeping it close
>Jesse_Day: DGNORSU O7 GOURD +42 336
#note I could consider dropping the S here, which I didn't really consider at the time, but it seems to be about even between keeping it and not keeping it.
>Winter: ACEH A11 .HECA +54 324
>Jesse_Day: INPSTTX 8A S.IP +36 372
#note I've only made one little mistake so far, but I choose a terrible time to make an awful, awful play. I suppose that seeing XIS is just a little bit tricky, but that play would've reallllly helped me out. but just wait until you see my next rack.
>Winter: AAIOORR O1 ORRA +17 341
#note I think I was so irritated by my draw that my handwriting got worse, because I have no idea what his play was. deduction says that it was this.
>Jesse_Day: JNQTTXZ -JQZT +0 372
#note I don't care about what the actual tiles in the pool were, but with 10 in the bag, the odds of me drawing JQZ out of the bag are 1/120...I've had worse pulls, but youch. Actually, in retrospect it's kind of hysterical. I can't complain, though, because XIS would have given me a really good chance even after my forced exchange. As far as the details of my exchange, the bag is so vowel heavy that I liked the idea of drawing a vowel for the X play at row 12 and then having a competitive leave on the rest of the board. Following my habits, though, this is actually a terrible exchange. Both Ts should clearly go back, but after that quackle would rather keep the Z than the X, which I'm not sure that I understand, but it's not even close. Exchanging 4 is also dumb with the blank unseen and such a friendly pool.
>Winter: AEIIOOO 12D OI +14 355
#note a smart play on his part, though little does he realize that I just threw back all the other power tiles, rather than drawing into the X by exchanging.
>Jesse_Day: AEFNTTX D11 ..X +12 384
#note alright, I can hear you saying right now - jesse, wtf?! Well, in retrospect this doesn't look so good. I didn't like either of my scoring plays like FATTEN or FATTER because they both empty the bag, and just pulling the Q or the J seems to put me in a great deal of trouble, knowing that he has only drawn two tiles since I put them back in the bag. I really wish there were a way to specify what's in the bag in quackle. Anyway, a multi-ply sim actually brings BOX about even with championship player's suggestion of FAX - but I suspect that quackle analysis might not be enough. I guess I'm hoping for winter to pick up the J or the Q on his next play, and even if he has the blank (which he very likely does) then maybe I'll be able to eke out the win with some kind of out-in-two.
>Winter: OO 7B .OO +11 366
>Jesse_Day: AEFNPTT A1 FATTEN +32 416
#note this looks ok - if he has two of the power tiles somehow (say holding the Z and pulling the J) then I have a chance even if he has the blank. I think FATTEN is better than FATTER because it gives back fewer really easy comebacks - a big play after FATTER is going to take a five tile play, and if he has two power tiles then that'll make him hugely inflexible and hopefully allow me to eke out a win. This preendgame takes quackle a lot of work to figure out (at least five minutes) and I worry that it doesn't do sticks very well at all, but it likes FATTEN by a big margin, but tied with PATTER at 2J, which doesn't allow him counter-plays to the triple. I'm not sure what to do with FN if I draw any of the scoring tiles, though. Does anyone have a better analysis?
>Winter: ?AEIQST 7M T.. +5 371
#note well, shit. winter asks me after the game "weren't you worried I was going to bingo?" Not gonna lie - that was the last of my worries.
>Jesse_Day: JPZ 5M P. +4 420
#note I thought I was blocking QUASI, but it turns out I didn't need to anyway because QUASI would give me a place for my Z. So I should've just made the obvious play of dumping the J. However, my play has a benefit I hadn't thought about, which is that it interferes with the one at a time slowplay at the end by taking the only spot for the Q, so this play is only 18 points worse than the best sequence I can find. Blame time pressure.
>Winter: ?AEIQS 2N E. +4 375
#note Winter's play is better than what Quackle comes up with, and I think he plays the best endgame possible after PI. nice playing, winter.
>Jesse_Day: JZ -  +0 420
>Winter: ?AIQS 11A .......S +18 393
>Jesse_Day: JZ -  +0 420
>Winter: ?AIQ J2 QuAI +34 427
#note Quackle is completely useless here, managing to stick itself with the Q if you follow its advice. I think the endgame solver must have some kind of math error that leads it not to deal correctly with cases where both sides have tiles left. This is better than the best slow play I can find, which is BOXy followed by AI at the top left.
>Winter:  (JZ) +36 463
#note A pretty frustrating game. I started out playing very well, but though I could just blame the draw for my misfortune, I made mistakes at critical junctures that could easily have ended up costing me the game. At the same time, I'm happy with how I played the odds in the preendgame, and I'm usually reluctant to blame anything on the draw, but I think my last two tiles killed me. But I could be wrong - what do you think I should've done?
