>Noah: AEEIIJT 8F AJEE +22 22
#note 8H is also a fine placement.
>Carl: AAAILMY 7H MAYA +17 17
#note Should play AY at 7H, i guess not to open up the triple. -2
>Noah: DEIIIOT 8K IDIOT +26 48
>Carl: AILLNNR L3 INLAN. +24 41
>Noah: ?EIMOSU O1 MOUSIEs. +80 128
#note(T)ItMOUSE is best, although I prefer MOUSIEs(T) because it seems like it blocks the board better. Thoughts? -1
>Carl: LNRSUUW F7 W.UL +9 50
#note UN(ME)W id s little better. -1.5
>Noah: AEHILTZ N6 HA. +28 156
#note What is this outrage! I saw HAZ(Y) soon afterward. -9
>Carl: DNNRSUY 11F SUNDRY +28 78
#note I good play to score and play clean up.
>Noah: BCEILTZ 9C ZEB. +25 181
#note Again stupid, BEZ(I)L is most obvious. -13
>Carl: AAGNORV 10A OVA +25 103
>Noah: CDIILOT 3G IDIOT.C +24 205
#note This play is self describing. O(O)LITIC, I(N)DICT, O(ZA)LID, all better. -7
>Carl: AABEGNR A7 BAR.NAGE +86 189
>Noah: FLLOPQS 15A SLOP +63 268
#note This undeserved draw further describes my last play.
>Carl: EEHINRV H1 VI.E +27 216
#note E(N)VIER is best. One of Carl's larger errors, but smaller than several of mine.
>Noah: EFLPQRU 5I QUE.L +28 296
#note PREQU(E)L is clearly the superior play here. I played this without thinking. -23
>Carl: EGHNRTW 2F WH.T +25 241
>Noah: ?CFFIPR 4D PRIC. +26 322
#note (G)RIFF, which I didn't know, is best. -5
>Carl: EEGGNRT 12K EGG +15 256
#note EGGER or GREET is best, NT isn't so bad, but I thought Carl was right. Despite this, Quackle says no,no,no. -11
>Noah: ?ADEFFO 14C DOFF +26 348
#note OFF here is clearly best. I should do this because ADE? is obviously miles better than AE?, and makes another undeserved bingo much more likely. -5
>Carl: EINNRRT C8 T..R +13 269
#note Nope, Quackle likes I(N)TERN. If he can get an outbingo, he might be able to win, and this makes that more possible by opening fruitful bingo lanes and keeping another open. Also note that it leaves fewer tiles in the bag, so I will more likely empty it. Another thing going for I(N)TERN is that it sets up an X spot if he gets it. -7
>Noah: ?AESTTX B5 AXE +30 378
#note I did not see EINKORN in the pool. I knew it I guess, maybe, but even then it's a hard find. EX blocks EINKORN and leaves two in the bag so the best he can do is ONERIER in the top-right. EX is clearly the star play here. -17
>Carl: EEINNOR 15F EON +14 283
#note (F)E is best, as it gives him a shot at getting an outbingo and making the gap much smaller. No play wins now. -13
>Noah: ?EKRSTT A1 STEaK +28 406
#note I missed STaRK! What was that! TuSker at 14J is the very best play. He should respond with IRE and then I go out. I win by 11 more points this way. Although if I do say so myself, the fact that it's A1 STEaK is funny. Now all we need is SAUCE somewhere below it on the board.  -11
>Carl: EINOR M10 RE.ION +14 307
>Carl:  (RT) +4 309
#note -78 for me and -44.5 for Carl. My errors were blatantly stupid (except for maybe EX, which is pretty hard) while his seemed like the play he made was intuitively the best, for the most part. So, another undeserved win against a much better player chalked up for me.
