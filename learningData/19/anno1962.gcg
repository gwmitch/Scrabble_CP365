>Mike: ADMOPSU 8E DUMP +18 18
#note Didn't even see DOUMA here. (Pity; I like that word, for some reason.) Eight-point error.
>Nigel: DIY 9G YID +28 28
>Mike: AEOSTTV E4 VOTE. +18 36
>Nigel: COZ 10H COZ +44 72
>Mike: AAHNRST 11I TAHR +29 65
#note Right idea, wrong word; NAH in this spot is best.
>Nigel: ?FGINRW 5D F.ReWING +78 150
>Mike: AMNRRSV 7B RAV.N +11 76
#note About 5 points worse than VARS L2; I agree, this wasn't good at all. REV G4 is also intriguing.
>Nigel: IQ 4I QI +24 174
>Mike: AAAEMRS 12J SMEAR +37 113
#note The sim winner here is 6B AA; however, this is where I disagree with Quackle's style. Behind by so much already, I need a bit of luck to catch up; the key, at least to me, is to score enough so that, when the luck does come in, the game is close enough that it matters. I like taking the points here (though SMEAR is the wrong way to do it; ASRAMA L4, which I didn't know, is a big improvement.
>Nigel: ABEO 4B ABO.E +32 206
>Mike: ?AAEGIX 13L EX +39 152
#note Woohoo, I got one right!
>Nigel: AEIKLOR 14G OARLIKE +81 287
#note Ow.
>Mike: ?AAEGIN 15C vAGINAE +84 236
>Nigel: INRU E11 UNRI. +12 299
>Mike: BDGLLOY 13C LO.DY +36 272
>Mike: BDGLLOY --  -36 236
#note Yes, I didn't know the Y hook on SMEAR. (BOLDLY in that spot is best.) Yes, I missed the G hook on RAVEN. (Plays there are further behind.) And yes, I played a phony to top it all off. To quote Bill Simmons of espn.com: "The lesson, as always: I'm an idiot."
>Nigel: FIJU 3J FUJI +34 333
>Mike: BDGLLOY 6J DOLLY +36 272
#note Hey, at least this play shows up on "Generate choices"! BOLDLY O7 is still best, though.
>Nigel: DEEINOT B6 O.IENTED +63 396
>Mike: ABCGLTU 15M LUG +23 295
#note Spot blindness again; CAB or GAB at A7 are best. At this point, I guess, fatigue was setting in.
>Nigel: AEPS A12 PASE +37 433
>Mike: ABCEOTW 3A OBA +22 317
#note Note to sell; Don't empty the bag if you can help it! BA at A8 is best. (Once again, I miss the hooks.)
>Nigel: EEINSST 2C SESTINE +64 497
#note Sorry I couldn't give you a better game, Nigel.
