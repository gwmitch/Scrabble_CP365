>Joey: DIV 8G VID +14 14
>Mike: ?DEEOST J3 DEvOTES +67 67
#note Why, exactly, didn't I play this one higher?
>Joey: EHIPRT 4D PRITHE. +32 46
>Mike: ACEIRTU H1 ARC. +27 94
#note The best play here never even occurred to me: DUI I8 is a powerhouse fish. RUCHE in the same spot as ARCH is also an improvement, but I didn't know it.
>Joey: ADEEGIM E4 .EIMAGED +98 144
>Mike: EIJTTTU 10B JUT. +27 121
>Joey: ELZ D6 LEZ +49 193
#note (Misscored as 48.)
>Mike: EGIRRTT H6 GR.TTIER +60 181
#note Doesn't open the triple line like GROTTIER 6H. (I'm not that desperate. Yet.)
>Joey: ADFORW 13C FORWA.D +34 227
>Mike: CEINOSU 12A CION +27 208
#note I didn't even look for the bingo here. I don't recall whether I've seen COINSURE, but it feels like I should have by now. This cuts my win chances from 56% to 28%.
>Joey: AOTU 14A AUTO +17 244
>Mike: EEEIOSU -EEIOU +0 208
#note Before this session, John Williams had made a joke about "we're switching to SOWPODS for the afternoon...just wanted to see if you were paying attention." I made reference to that ("Pity it was just a joke, eh?") as I exchanged EUOI face up.
>Joey: OU I6 OU. +13 257
>Mike: ELLNSXY A12 .L.Y +27 235
#note A few points behind NELLY 15D; I guess Quackle wants me to turn over tiles and race to the ?QSS in the pool.
>Joey: ?EGILNO 11G L.GrOINE +66 323
>Mike: AEKLNSX 15D KANES +55 290
#note Close between this and KALES in the same spot; KEXES N10 is further back, because it restricts a lane I'm going to need.
>Joey: BBI 10L BIB +29 352
#note (Misscored as 28.)
>Mike: AEELNSX O6 AXELS +44 334
#note He blocked ALEXINES, dagnabbit! EX at either 14F or 14I wins the sim by a mile, which is rather confusing to me. I know Joey won't always have the means to block the bingo lane, but the bingo may not score enough anyway (especially if he has the Q and can score with it). Thoughts? I just figured I needed to take the points and hope for some help from the bag. 
>Joey: HOPQ N3 QOPH +39 391
#note Okay, I didn't deserve to get punished like that.
>Mike: AAEENUW 2E AWA.E +16 350
#note This is the static player's top choice, doesn't appear anywhere in Championship Player's list, and sims 7th in a many-ply sim. I'm outvoted, I guess. (M6 AWE preserves what little chance I have best.) I figured I needed to draw into a big play at A1.
>Joey: AFMOY 1A FOAMY +53 444
>Mike: EIINSUV O1 VEIN +38 388
#note Best!
>Joey: NNR F4 .NN +12 456
>Mike: ISU 12K IS +16 404
#note Not best! SI at J12 is three points better.
>Joey: R 7C R.. +6 462
>Joey:  (U) +2 464
#note (Score recorded as 462-404.)
