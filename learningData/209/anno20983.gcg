#note Quackle says play VAND(A) at 2K. In hindsight, I should have thought about this...I don't even think I really looked for valid moves. Just a note: 8 I's are out (unrelated)

#note Championship player says play ONIU(M). I saw it, and it was actually an option the next play, but I felt like it was too volatile with the beautiful unseen pool. I really just have to hope that I draw the blank here, but perhaps I should have gone all in and tried ONIU(M) now.

#note Not playing VAND(A) was a bit of an error, and I probably should have just played ONIU(M) instead of NOI(R) but my drawing this game prevented me from really having a good chance
