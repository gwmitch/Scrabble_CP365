#note This is the play that bit me really hard, as you'll see by what he plays. A simulation here doesn't conclude much more than the fact that I bingo 3% less often given the defense of my play versus other bingo options.

#note I wanted to keep things open, so I chose this. POIND wins a sim by about 1.5 over H1 LOPE(R), but I like my play. I take out the D hook immediately, and keep the board decent for bingoing now that I'm behind. (-4.6)

#note 12A XERUS sims better. I played quick here, didn't even see it. Considering that both blanks are out, and it's really hard for him to hit (V)E(X)ING or (X)YST, this is a good play.  (-2.9)

#note I saw and considered D(I)ARY, which isn't simming terrible worse. Considering that he triple triples, I should have played DIARY :-).
