>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEMRSS 11D hARM.ESS +86 114
#note Joel was exclaiming his exasperation about not drawing any of the power tiles in his last game. So, this turn, I made an insidious pun about how "it doesn't hurt to get power tiles!". I thought this took a front C, and it does!
>Joel_Horn: FRU J11 .URF +15 28
#note Next to me, Adam Logan, already way ahead of the pack, was playing Bradley Whitmarsh, and the champ had just bingo-ed twice in a row. I see him draw EEEIMNS out of the bag, and see his only TWL bingo. Since Joel is taking a while to play, I write a classic Josh pun on my scoresheet! It reads: "Adam is making a lot of ENEMIES!"
>Joshua_Sokol: AADGHLP F10 G.APH +23 137
#note I enjoyed making this weird play! It doesn't increase his average score, as there is already a (better) S spot for him that he just created. This interfered with a lot of bingos he could have for a lot, and made the board only good for esses. Not something you normally want to do with a lead! For some reason this seemed right though. I wish I could remember my exact thought process. I knew that compared to the other GRAPH for 3 more at 13I, I would take this to keep things tighter, and also remembered that I felt in control of this game so long as Joel didn't have a 3x3, which is why I didn't play 12A GALAH. Anyways, this is classic Josh.

#note oho!

#note Just insanely perfect :P. How to win a tournament 101.

#note ruh roh!
>Joshua_Sokol: INOQTWZ 4H ZIN.O +46 273
#note If I draw an I, I am so totally in business, I don't even have to worry about that opening Joel just created!
>Joel_Horn: ABEI H1 BAI.E +48 154
#note aww
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIOQTW A8 GODWIT +46 319
#note I was all set to play QI for 46, setting up WODGE if I drew an E, which seemed really really strong for a dynamic board like this one, but I think A8 GODWIT might have been the right play regardless, and I would have missed it if Joel hadn't taken my easy QI spot.
>Joel_Horn: HWY 3L WHY +29 183
>Joshua_Sokol: EINPQRT 3G Q. +21 340
#note Nooooo!!! The Noah Walton curse lives on! I should have at least seen and considered 2F TR(A)NQ even if it might have been the wrong play... There are too many Q words now :)
>Joel_Horn: EIMN 8K .IMEN +24 207
>Joshua_Sokol: EINPRRT 13I P.INTER +24 364
#note Time to change gears and rush to the endgame.

#note Oh no! K(R)AI+ for 39!
>Joel_Horn: ADENOST B10 OE +14 237
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELNOT 2N OE +14 411
#note Ok, this was really dumb with the J out, cause if I don't draw into a bingo, and he does, he'll be cashing the J next turn most likely... This doesn't seem to be good for spread at all, as I intended it to be. 
>Joel_Horn: CEILSTU C4 LUCITES +65 302
#note And then I go ahead and lose more than 100 points of spread because I didn't remember this word. Oy... Not impressive.
