#note I don't think I considered JETE in the same spot. Silly mistake.

#note If I hadn't opened, he would have had to find hEROINE at 12A or cOIN(H)ERE. I think he would have spotted HEROINE.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINSTX 1G EXCIT.NS +101 169
#note And here I thought my CX draw wasn't what I wanted...
>Deen_Hergott: ADIU 3I ADI.U +14 126
>Joshua_Sokol: EFHLRRY F10 F.RLY +27 196
#note I played this quickly, thinking Deen wouldn't challenge, cause FURLY* seemed to me to be a common phony if I remembered correctly. I knew that HER was the best leave between FER, HEL, FEL and HER (my other leaves with the other plays in the same spot. He held, and let it go. Lucky.
>Deen_Hergott: III -III +0 126
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGHOOR 14B GOOE. +18 214
#note After I played this, I noticed that 12D GO(R)E made more sense. At least it seemed Deen was fishing, so he couldn't hit me too hard down there.
>Deen_Hergott: CEIOS 12A COSIE. +27 153
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEFHRT 2D DEFT +18 232
#note I was sort of at a loss here. I was choosing between 15C DEF, 2D DEFT, and something else that left my E, like exchanging or playing two off. Given that there were a lot of A's, E's and I's to come, playing C12 (S)H(O)D for 16 seems like the best play here. It scores fine, partially blocks the big hotspot at 15A, and doesn't close a bingo lane I might need if Deen bingos and I can't respond. But I judged the bingo lane to be OK left alone.
