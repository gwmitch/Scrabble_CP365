>Bernard_Gotlieb: IKLT H5 KILT +16 16
#note At a certain level of strategic understanding, players tend to do this instead of the "standard" H7 KILT. In their mind, they do not want to give me a good S hook (I can thereby infer no S on their rack most of the time). But in doing that they slot a tile in the 2x2 lane, increasing my average score this turn. Especially with the letter being slotted as a K, this is not optimal.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADFGIN 5F FA.ING +28 28
#note a fairly average punishment for the suboptimal placement of KILT.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ATW I3 WA.T +13 29
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADDEGL 8A GLADDEs. +86 114
#note ...A fairly disproportionate becoming of a suboptimal placement of KILT. Of note, 2I ADELGiD+. Nice word.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DO 6K OD +6 35
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIPPRS 7C PEEP +28 142
#note I considered PREPI(L)ES. It didn't make sense and Bernard would surely challenge. EIPRS is a great leave. But Bernard is close to a bingo, and EIPRS isn't that good on this board after a bingo. I therefore judged that I should just go for points, I'm too far ahead to be trying to keep bingo-ey leaves for 11 less.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EILNOST M6 ENTOILS +63 98
#note 3G TO(W)LINES and the new ONLIEST+
>Joshua_Sokol: IORRSSU N2 ORRIS +21 163
#note I briefly saw 7C PEEPU(L) as a possibility last turn I think, but forgot about it! It looks great to play PEEPULS for 24! Bernard might not even know the word. I missed 8J SUI(T)OR here. I played this cause I perceived it as a probable advantage to set up an M hook on ORRIS, since Bernard likely did not know M(ORRIS) and even expect it to come up if he did. SUI(T)OR is still the best play by far, and PEEPULS is better too. 
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HOO 9A OOH +27 125
>Joshua_Sokol: ABORSUU 12J URU. +8 171
#note I missed the word AUSUBO on my rack. Damn. This was me not knowing what to do. Bad play. I also didn't know the 5, RUBUS!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EGO 6A EGO +17 142

>Joshua_Sokol: ABJRSU A1 ABJUR. +48 298
#note dunno what my last tile was, but this is the clear play regardless. It wasn't an E! This was held.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AINZ 4C NAZI +31 259
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEISV 3I .EAVE. +29 327
#note Seems this was my rack, missing plays at 8K. Just wasn't thinking of opening anything else up. VA(T)IC looks OK
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HY 8M .HY +27 286
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIOQRS O1 QIS +51 378
#note well, no M for my secret hook...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?ADEIMT 12B MeDIATE +80 366
#note Wow! Looks like Bernard has to play D(Y)nAMITE for 64 to go for the R. I wouldn't think DYNAMITER were valid at all! What a weird position that would have been...
>Joshua_Sokol: ACLMORV 14B CAROM +41 419
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EFINTY 15F YETI +30 396
#note Bernard held CAROM for an eternity! My confidence in its validity went from 100% to 99% in that period of time.
