>Joshua_Sokol: AEIJQTT H7 QAT +24 24
>Deen_Hergott: ORTY I8 TORY +13 13
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIJTT J6 JET +29 53
#note I don't think I considered JETE in the same spot. Silly mistake.
>Deen_Hergott: HLRU 11E HURL. +22 35
>Joshua_Sokol: EGINOST K5 GO +15 68
>Deen_Hergott: ?EEINOR L1 ONERIEr +77 112
#note If I hadn't opened, he would have had to find hEROINE at 12A or cOIN(H)ERE. I think he would have spotted HEROINE.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINSTX 1G EXCIT.NS +101 169
#note And here I thought my CX draw wasn't what I wanted...
>Deen_Hergott: ADIU 3I ADI.U +14 126
>Joshua_Sokol: EFHLRRY F10 F.RLY +27 196
#note I played this quickly, thinking Deen wouldn't challenge, cause FURLY* seemed to me to be a common phony if I remembered correctly. I knew that HER was the best leave between FER, HEL, FEL and HER (my other leaves with the other plays in the same spot. He held, and let it go. Lucky.
>Deen_Hergott: III -III +0 126
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGHOOR 14B GOOE. +18 214
#note After I played this, I noticed that 12D GO(R)E made more sense. At least it seemed Deen was fishing, so he couldn't hit me too hard down there.
>Deen_Hergott: CEIOS 12A COSIE. +27 153
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEFHRT 2D DEFT +18 232
#note I was sort of at a loss here. I was choosing between 15C DEF, 2D DEFT, and something else that left my E, like exchanging or playing two off. Given that there were a lot of A's, E's and I's to come, playing C12 (S)H(O)D for 16 seems like the best play here. It scores fine, partially blocks the big hotspot at 15A, and doesn't close a bingo lane I might need if Deen bingos and I can't respond. But I judged the bingo lane to be OK left alone.
>Deen_Hergott: AEGILNS D2 .EALINGS +74 227
#note I kind of knew this was going to happen and that it was going to block (D)EHORNED
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEHNOR 15A HOED +40 272
#note HONED is better. I keep missing plays left and right...
>Deen_Hergott: NU C9 UN +6 233
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKMNPR A8 REPI.K +42 314
#note another point in which I could have lost the game. This isn't a word. I thought it was.
>Deen_Hergott: NW 3C W.N +14 247
>Joshua_Sokol: ABMMNR 6B BR.M +14 328
#note I can't remember what my last tile was. I considered this and B9 MAN(O), and I preferred this because of leave and also cause it blocked stuff. Maybe MB(I)RA was better. I know I didn't see it.
>Deen_Hergott: ?AESTUV K8 SUAVEsT +72 319
>Deen_Hergott: ?AESTUV --  -72 247
#note another really lucky break that puts the game out of reach for Deen.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAADIMN 5D .AMA +20 348
#note oops, A(L)MA.
>Deen_Hergott: ?AESTUV H11 .UV +7 254
#note I didn't attempt to block ADIEUS/SUAVEST. I doubted he would attempt it being so buried, but I knew ADIEUS was good.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADILNV 13H .ANDAL +22 370
#note this was just me deciding to take a sure win but probably losing a lot of spread in the process.
>Deen_Hergott: ?ABEOST N7 BOATErS +71 325
#note 14I SEABOoT is 85
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIVWZ 12K IZA. +51 421
#note -7 to M9 ZA. I didn't track right so whatever
>Deen_Hergott: IP 8M P.I +15 340
#note he had 2 seconds before this play, one after. I guess -1 since if he plays PI for 26 he loses 10 on time.
>Deen_Hergott:  (WIEV) +20 360
