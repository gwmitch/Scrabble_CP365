>Charles_Reinke: DEILPST H4 PLIED +22 22
#note C: I thought about exchanging here. EILPST is really good, as it bingos with all the vowels (thanks to SPILITE+). That's probably not the exchange I would have come up with.
>Thomas_Reinke: CERTTUU 4D CUTU. +18 18
>Charles_Reinke: HIJSTYY -HIJYY +0 22
#note C: Quackle would rather I play through this. I just don't see how my J becomes useful at all after I play something like 7G Y(E)H.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIRRTV 8H .IVERTER +89 107
>Charles_Reinke: ?AGNOST K4 cOAG.NTS +82 104
>Thomas_Reinke: AELLMUY 4K .ULLY +22 129
#note T: Too easy for him to score in this spot. J5 MY looks good.
>Charles_Reinke: AAEORTW O1 WAR. +30 134
#note C: ...AWA(Y)...
>Thomas_Reinke: AAEGMOZ N1 AZO.E +57 186
#note Type a note here!
>Charles_Reinke: ADENOOT O8 .ATOONED +80 214
>Thomas_Reinke: AEGMNOY N12 GOY +29 215
#note T: MAYO in the same spot is harder for him to score tons of points alongside.
>Charles_Reinke: CHIMOSX 7G H.X +42 256
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEIMNQ E3 Q.AI +26 241
#note T: E4 UMIAQ is better. I think I overvalue this type of leave.
>Charles_Reinke: CGIJMOS 6J J.G +27 283
#note C: I figured COM(PLIED) was not likely to get blocked next turn, so I took this play first, which was more likely to get disrupted (although still not very likely to).
>Thomas_Reinke: ?EELMNU M13 MEN +26 267
#note T: UNMEETLY and UNMELTED are the bingos. This is not a good play. At all. What was I thinking here?
>Charles_Reinke: CFIIMOS H1 COM..... +45 328
>Thomas_Reinke: ?BEELOU 7C BEL +22 289
#note T: More horrible misses: NEBULOSE and BLUENOSE.
>Charles_Reinke: ADFIISV 8A AVID +39 367
>Thomas_Reinke: ?EINOTU 1A UNErOTI. +77 366
#note T: I chicken out on UNPOETIC, so relieved I am just to be bingoing.
>Charles_Reinke: BEFHINS 6D F.B +21 388
#note Holding out hope of bingoing with my EHINS leave.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEIKSST 6N SI +21 387
#note T: Not much to be done on this board. The only higher scoring play is 9C TSK, which scores 22.
>Charles_Reinke: EFHINRS G3 H.E +23 411
#note C: If I blatantly fish off my F here, Thomas will probably block row 11 bingos, leaving me to try to bingo through the A in the first column. However, AEHINRS bingos with just two out of eighteen remaining tiles. My thinking wasn't that exact but I knew that I would have to leave something different if I wanted to have a chance to draw a bingo that played in both spots. This play doesn't scream "FISH!" and it could work out if I draw some good vowels.
>Thomas_Reinke: AADEKST 2H .AK +17 404
>Charles_Reinke: FIINORS 10F FORIN. +19 430
#note C: My goal was to block the S since the pool is looking pretty good now. However, this gives up sevens in a bad way. L11 IF, played with the hope to outrun Thomas with my 16-point lead, is probably the right choice. 
>Thomas_Reinke: ADEEIST 11A IDEATES +73 477
>Charles_Reinke: EINRRSW A10 W.RIER +30 460
#note C: I didn't take the proper amount of time here since I knew the game was over. 12D WIRERS is 41.
>Thomas_Reinke: AP 2A PA +16 493
>Thomas_Reinke:  (NS) +4 497
