>Michael_Fagen: AABEERT 8C ABATER +22 22
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHKLMS 9C HEM +29 29
#note I wished Michael would have given me an I here! But he gave me an A, and I missed H(A)KEEMS for 50 points, a word I am not entirely familiar with, but that I might have played had I seen it.
>Michael_Fagen: ADEIU 10C ADIEU +25 47
>Joshua_Sokol: EGKLSVY 7E KEY +35 64
>Michael_Fagen: ABDU 6F BAUD +30 77
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLNRSV I3 VEL. +12 76
#note I considered this and exchanging, but I liked what this did to the board. Maybe I should have focused on my rack more.
>Michael_Fagen: DEGGISU 11D US +33 110
>Michael_Fagen: DEGGISU --  -33 77
#note I played KEY noticing that it set up an S hook that only I could use most likely, but I didn't think it would actually come up. Lucky me.
>Joshua_Sokol: GNNRSST 4H G.NTS +16 92
>Michael_Fagen: DEGGU K4 .UGGED +18 95
>Joshua_Sokol: FNNRSTZ 8J F.Z +25 117
>Michael_Fagen: EIIOOSX J8 .OX +32 127
#note looks like perhaps L6 OO(Z)E is his play this turn. Blocks Z plays and sets up his X in two spots. A good setup. Otherwise EIOOS looks significantly better than EIIOS here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENNRRST F10 .RN +3 120
#note Maybe I want to play I9 RENT for 19 and be less aggro? Dunno. I played this to reduce his scoring chances over URN right nextdoor.
>Michael_Fagen: DEIIOOS L6 OO.E +23 150
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHNRST 13B ANTHERS +76 196
#note Banking on him not seeing the P hook, slightly, but I missed M9 for 78. That may be better depending on what range I have him with. I know he still has his S, kind of worried about that.
>Michael_Fagen: AIP 12B PIA +20 170
#note !!!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIIIPW A13 PIA +28 224
#note What do I do now? PAW for 37? I guess. I never considered keeping III... I just had to make the play he should have made for the psychological advantage it gave me.
>Michael_Fagen: CEIIMNS H13 .IM +15 185
#note ME(S)IC
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AFIIRW I9 RAW +22 246
#note IT looked to be between 3L IF for 12 and I9 RAW here, or exchanging. Taking 22 looked fine.
>Michael_Fagen: CDEINOS 10L DOC +27 212
#note I don't know if Michael knew RAWS, but if he did, he missed SECONDI. Maybe he forgot the word as well. He told me he was unhappy there was nowhere for CODEINS.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CFIIRT N5 CRITI. +12 258
#note There was no way DOC goes down without at least an S. This is the clear play in that case, or CITRIC.
>Michael_Fagen: EEINNSY 11I .YN +35 247
#note (W)YE looks better.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?FIJNSW O7 FINS +41 299
#note Looking quite alright for me, but perhaps I should block the M with JIS(M)!
>Michael_Fagen: ?EEINRS 15H .ISENtER +80 327
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EJOUVW N12 WOV. +20 319
#note Upon seeing the pool, it looks pretty good for me after this play. Blocking QA(T), overlaps, and not giving anything back, as well as keeping the U for the Q and the J for scoring.
>Michael_Fagen: ELLLOTT 12L LO.E +16 343
#note This is a very difficult position for Michael. It seems he needs to keep his E though for the endgame, since otherwise he just has no flexibility whatsoever. So LOTT(O) and LO(W) spring to mind. This is not a good preendgame play, but it's a very difficult position to go about over a board!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIJOU E13 .UE +6 325
#note Michael draws the Q as he should have last turn. If I had the Q though, I would have won regardless, since I had the blank. I knew I couldn't figure this endgame out on my own, so I just went with what I thought would win. Can you figure out the best endgame play? Pretty sure Quackle cannot, so it's up to us humans! :)
>Michael_Fagen: LLOQTT B12 ..T +14 357
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIJO 5B rIOJA +28 353
#note I saw K14 OI, which was really cute since it gave me many more points for JAT(O), but Michael will just block with TO/T(OE)/(L)O(IN), leaving him with a better play and leaving me forced to play JA(V)a for 25 for a total of 61 points in the endgame, when just playing out gave me 62.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (LLOQT) +28 381
