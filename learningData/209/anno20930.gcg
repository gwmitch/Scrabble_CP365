>Opp: DDKNRRU H4 KNURR +28 28
#note I have to admit, I was quite nervous. I was playing my superior, and I had to win. I was certainly an underdog. I had a sense of urgency, and just threw this down right when I saw my last tile. It's as if something was testing how hardy I was. Can I overcome things that normally put me on tilt? When I realized what I had done, I was kicking myself so hard. The difference between the leaves DD and DR is around 6 points. DRUNK being two more points, that makes this an 8-point mistake on the surface. Except that with an A draw, I hit (DRUNK)ARD... Drawing an A is quite likely, so estimating here, this was a 13-point mistake. Definitely definitely not how I want to start a game. Yet, I think I seem to have kept my composure.

#note I had some sort of temptation this tournament to open up triple-triples with a Z in hand. Playing offense is a good idea with the Z, but to an extent in which you're just giving off free points? Probably not. 5D MUD is 27, and much more conservative. Maybe play that in a do-over. Definitely not this.

#note I missed V(I)AND in the same spot. More points down the drain.
>Jason: AEJNNSS C3 J.NES +26 104
#note Preserves the S hook of KNURR makes it slightly better than J(O)ANNES in my books.  Quackle sim agrees.

#note Surprisingly, this was the only bingo. After seeing this I looked for a long while for other things, convinced there were more, but no. This was held, just as I held STALING.

#note Quackle prefers playing N2 (R)EBUY.  The S has large value on this board and I wasn't happy getting rid of it.  It's the last U and with the Q unseen I don't think it's as bad as usual to keep it. 

Josh: this is a really tought turn. Nothing even scores close to this except O11 SUBER, which sucks otherwise. If I don't have the S, Jason is a very big favorite to win. But it does give me a huge strategical advantage if I do indeed have it. Perhaps patience is merited here for Jason, and perhaps (R)EBUY is the play.
>Opp: NOPSTTW 10J WO. +32 323
#note It looks like I should shed my S not and play O11 STOWP. But by keeping the S, Jason is more at a loss of what to do, so that may point the arrow in the direction of my play. STOWP is 41. Hmm...
>Jason: BEEIQRU D8 QUIE. +24 332
#note A few options here, this is the one Quackle likes too.
>Opp: ENOPSTT O11 SPENT +38 361
#note I also considered fishing, but that's a really bad way to go. Totally not what makes sense here in my opinion.
>Jason: BEILPRT 7G T.IBE +23 355
#note I couldn't see a way to win the game.  Every fishing play gets blocked 100% of the time.  I ran out of time and just laid this down. 

Josh: it wins sometimes, me and Jason briefly looked at some scenarios. It seems to be his best shot.
>Opp: DHIOOOT E10 DH.OTI +33 394
#note N11 (N)ODI is the best endgame play but I really really didn't care to look for something better than this sure win.
>Jason: AELPR 15D P.LEA +30 385
#note REPLA(N) but I was out of time. 

Josh: and this might win if I mess up somehow, or don't have an out or something crazy.
>Opp: OO 6K .OO +12 406
#note And that's how you do it, folks. Dumb luck wins tournaments. I didn't play particularly well at all this weekend. I didn't draw particularly well either, but somehow my timing was insanely good. I had a bunch of tough tough runs of bad racks, but it never seemed to cost me the game like it has in the past. Maybe since I was keeping cool? Mostly luck probably. Thanks to Jason for being a good sport. We both know that he deserved the win this tournament!
