>Charles_Reinke: CLOSVVZ H7 COZ +28 28
>Thomas_Reinke: ADEFLOR I9 ALFREDO +75 75
#note T: My best play of the tournament, considering the incredible difficulty I have in seeing this word.
>Charles_Reinke: AELOSVV 15H V.LVA +36 64
>Thomas_Reinke: GGINOSU 12H G.OUSING +78 153
>Charles_Reinke: AENOPSW J3 WEAPONS +80 144

#note T: K3 OHIA or something.
>Charles_Reinke: ABEINUU O6 NUBIA +26 170
>Thomas_Reinke: AADEERS K4 DEAR +23 210
#note T: Despite all the bingos, the board is messed up already. I could have fished, but it didn't seem likely to work.
>Charles_Reinke: EEFIKOU L6 KEF +26 196
#note C: Why not KEEF? There's plenty of E's left.
>Thomas_Reinke: AAEELST 11F LEA. +10 220
#note T: No tempting options, this isn't too bad.
>Charles_Reinke: EIMOPTU 10A UPTIME +22 218
#note C: Somehow I decided this was better than the same word at N1.
>Thomas_Reinke: ABEEIST A7 BEA.TIES +83 303
>Charles_Reinke: ?CEEOSW 4D COlEWE..S +122 340
#note C: I thought it was good. Turns out I was thinking of COLEWORT. L1 WOES would probably be my best non-phony option.

T: I held, but didn't seriously consider challenging this. I even said "nice play".

C: What a dummy.
>Thomas_Reinke: NNNQTUY D8 QU.NT +48 351
#note T: One of the reasons for not challenging (other than my delusional belief that COLEWEEDS* was a word) was that this put me back in the lead.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AAERTT B1 TuATERA +70 410
#note C: B2 TAbARET is a lot better.
