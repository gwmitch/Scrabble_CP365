>George_Macaulay: ITTWY 8D WITTY +30 30
#note Macaulay was gibsonized which meant I got to play him again. Which meant I was going to end my tournament in a less than ideal fashion. Unless.....
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEHNRT E5 THR.CED +52 52
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEHNRT --  -52 0
#note Unless I play a stupid phony and get away with it.
>George_Macaulay: GILV E7 V.GIL +18 48
#note I already felt like it was over.
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEHNRT D10 TENCH +24 24
>George_Macaulay: AAMW 13B MA.AW +24 72
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIORS 12F OREIDES +73 97
#note Lucky draw, I might be able to un-meltdown the game. OSIERED doesn't give him the juicy S.
>George_Macaulay: ?AILOTU J8 aUTO.IAL +62 134
#note With a rack like this, George isn't going to play a phony for no reason.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEOUV 15H BE.OVED +51 148
#note I didn't even know the kind of game-crushing trouble I was getting myself into here.
>George_Macaulay: IIIUUU -IIIUUU +0 134
#note But I caught Macaulay on an empty magazine.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFPRSU B10 FRU.P +40 188
#note That is just...... disgusting. I mean how often do you score that many points with a non-3x3.
>George_Macaulay: AANOS O11 ANOAS +60 194
#note Instead he gets to play ANOAS for 60, but that doesn't happen very often either. I held briefly, but then I remembered DEARESTS was added, so there's no way this wasn't a word.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENPSSX I11 P.X +41 229
#note Sim actually likes S(I)X the best here. I thought about it, but thought showing my extra S could trigger a defensive response.
>George_Macaulay: DEOZ A7 DOZE +47 241
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEKNSS K3 SiCKENS +77 306
#note Keeping the P would have forced me to find either UNPICKS or PYKNICS, and I didn't know either word. They also only play down K, which he could have blocked.
>George_Macaulay: AAFL 6A ALFA +24 265
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNOQRU 4H QUO.N +46 352
#note Quackle prefers QUINO(A). Admittedly I played QUO(i)N before I had a chance to see other Q plays. I disagree.  QUO(i)N makes it much harder for him to bingo and also denies him cheap Q points (he might have the last U). Same with L1 QUIN, why give him 40 points for no reason?
>George_Macaulay: IJN 5G JIN +23 288
>Matthew_Larocque: BEIILOR 14D .ILI +19 371
#note I did want to deal with N, but hooking the A on that side isn't actually that friendly for him (you can't hook with -IER -ER -ING). If he did land a bingo there it wouldn't score much either. Even if I tried to block, he'd still be able to reopen, and it would likely be an easier line than the one that's already there. I felt better about scoring and leaving the semi-unwieldy line for now.
>George_Macaulay: OY 15A OY +31 319
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEORRU 11I ..RE +18 389
#note BOEU(F) is new! I figured after this play, I could stick the B out which he can't play a bingo too.
>George_Macaulay: AH N13 HA. +23 342
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEORRU 10L RUB +14 403
>George_Macaulay: AT 6K .AT +7 349
#note He said this was for nothing, because he was thinking of #KATI.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEORRT 7A .OE +13 416
#note Champ says just play (D)O, I don't get it. Simulation choses (J)OT(T)ER. I saw that he might have something like MING(L)ED so I didn't want him to play that. Turns out he had NIGG(L)ED!
>George_Macaulay: DEGGIIN F2 GIED +22 371
#note Nice, he guarantees he goes out next turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMRRT 3B REEM.T +18 434
#note RETRIM is 22.
>George_Macaulay: GIN 4H .....ING +19 390
>George_Macaulay:  (R) +2 392
#note Woohoo! I salvaged a bad tournament, but I waited to beat Macaulay after it was too late :(
