#note Spent a long time here weighing my other options. Then this popped out at me and I played it almost insantly.

#note Was unsure of LAZULITE; thought I might be getting it confused with LAZURITE. The other bingos didn't seem quite worth it. As Quackle reminds me, passing up bingos is stupid pretty much always.

>Charles_Reinke: ??AEORU 13G A.O +14 162
#note I spent way too long here. There's nothing from the D, but a bingo from the P would have been okay (APTEROUS, POURABLE, POULARDE, PAROQUET). Again, I don't know why I thought this was better than something like L5 (L)ABOUrER, considering how little my play scores.

#note Chosen over GOTHS to set up something like 10M OX(O). No joke! That was my line of thinking. I may have also thought I could draw a challenge on VIVAT+. Pretty soon you'll see why this play is horrawful.

>Charles_Reinke: AIINRRX E5 INR.. +10 313
#note I thought this was a good play to set up my X for decent points. I didn't consider L5 (L)ARI, which would prevent Jacquelyn's next play.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: OW L3 OW. +33 355
>Charles_Reinke: AEILRTX D1 RETAX +35 348
#note Due to taking way too long in the middle-game, I have about a minute to analyze the situation, and of course, I totally screw it up. This play gives up way too much in response and might be the worst play that uses the X in this spot. D3 TAX for 29 would limit her scoring options to playing in column C for not many points.

#note No time left to see 1D (R)IMER. I can win after that point if she misses 5B TA(XI).

#note I pretty much misplayed the whole game. Good job Charles!
