ESTIMATE D4 best.    I recognize it scores 13 more than mine, but the proximity to thw two different DWS spots seemed VERY aggressive.   Is there something else I'm not weighing?

OY O8 best, mine 11 valuated points back, despite being second-highest scoring play (behind YODS).
Does my play leave the board too open, or perhaps burn too many consonants given the bag unseen is frightfully vowel-heavy?
