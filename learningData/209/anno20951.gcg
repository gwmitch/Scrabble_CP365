>Charles_Reinke: AAAEFNU G7 F.UNAE +14 14
#note Not the rack you want when your opponent opens with a bingo, but it also doesn't help to give them a huge hotspot while only scoring 14 points. I can play the same letters for four more points with UN(S)AFE, or just forget about leave and play 7G FEU.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: JO F6 JO. +32 106
>Charles_Reinke: AAEKNTU H12 NUKE +30 44
#note I can get back in the game quicker with NUKE than NEUK, since I might be able to bingo across row 15.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: INP I13 PIN +23 129
#note So much for that. Scored as 22.
>Charles_Reinke: AAAAETY D7 A.AYA +10 54

>Charles_Reinke: AEEEHTX E10 AXE +63 117
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: CEFINU C2 CUNEIF +39 203
#note I didn't recognize it (obviously because it's phony) but I don't recognize a lot of sixes. Plus it looks like CUNEIFORM kinda. A successful challenge here would be big, however, a lost challenge would almost lose me the game. The solution, obviously, is to learn all the sixes so that this doesn't happen.
>Charles_Reinke: EEHLLRT B4 ETH +31 148
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: AEST A6 ATES +18 221
#note I couldn't make sense of this play at all. Jacquelyn must have another S, but her other two letters are a mystery. Maybe she had AEIOSST.
>Charles_Reinke: AEILLRU 13E LI +13 161
#note There aren't any standout plays here. I thought AELRU had decent synergy with the open C, T, and S. Or I could do A(C)ULEI, but that might be a bad idea since Jacquelyn just telegraphed an S.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: DGIOW 4A W..DIGO +32 253

>Jacquelyn_Fyr: DOY 4J YOD +27 280
>Charles_Reinke: BDEILMS 3G LIMB +24 249
#note This sims best (contain your back pats), but if Jacquelyn blocks the S hook on RUDERAL, I'm pretty much toast.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: MOP J12 MOP +33 313
>Charles_Reinke: ADEEOSV 12J .OVE +18 267
#note A1 AVO(W) was very tempting, and I almost insta-played it, but I wanted to set up another, easier, bingo lane. I don't think I can win if I don't bingo at some point. Holding two of the last three E's helps me in that Jacuqelyn probably won't be bingoing again even with two S's out. Then again, the leave after AVO(W) is pretty good, and it's a lot more points than this.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: IQS N10 QIS +42 355
#note Even if I bingo I'm probably not going to win at this point.
>Charles_Reinke: ADDESTV 6L DAD +16 283
#note F12 V(I)D maybe. 
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: IORT O7 ROTI +23 378
>Charles_Reinke: CEISTVW A1 VIE. +30 313
#note I could play I1 CW(M) and hope that Jacuqelyn has GHLNNRT and can't block.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: CNOR K9 CRO.N +20 398
>Charles_Reinke: GHRSSTW E2 WH.G +22 335
#note I looked for plays that involved placing the S at D12 but missed TH(E)S(E). Singular of THESES I guess.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: EILNT M11 L.ET +10 408
>Charles_Reinke: RSST M4 S..TS +14 349
#note H2 R(I)S(U)S is kinda cool. One day I will remember that word confidently enough to play it, but the day when I get to play it and have it be the right play will probably never again arrive.
>Jacquelyn_Fyr: IN 14M .IN +6 414

#note Final: 415-349.
