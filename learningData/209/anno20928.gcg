>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIPR -E +0 0
#note If I'm going to win this game, I'm going to have to stop making really silly decisions after this turn. What was I thinking? I asked myself that right after I played. This doesn't even bingo with 1/3 of the pool.
>Wayne_Barclay: ALLWY H4 WALLY +30 30
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIPR 4D RIPE.EED +78 78
#note I play this quickly, thinking it's phony. He accepts, I draw. Wayne realizes later that he scored this as 28 even though I said 78 when I played. He didn't realize this was a bingo! He would have probably challenged if he did...
>Wayne_Barclay: ABH 3C BAH +23 53
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEFSST L1 FEAST +54 132
#note although this was enough points that he probably should have held...
>Wayne_Barclay: AEL 1L .EAL +21 74
>Joshua_Sokol: EEESTUV 5C VEE +27 159
>Wayne_Barclay: ACENORS 9B CANOERS +73 147
#note and then I let him get away with WALLYS cause it's so ridiculous. I didn't know the word WALLY well enough to be any sort of certain that it didn't take an S like HENRY and BENDY and BIALY and COADY and PLATY and TELLY and ZLOTY! I had too much respect for Wayne's word knowledge. No more! :P
>Joshua_Sokol: AAESTUU O1 .UAU +5 164
#note to block the L, I would rather that not be an issue later.

>Wayne_Barclay: DNOPU 11G POUND +21 204
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGLMTT 3L .GM. +14 246
#note Not sure about this one. I think it's right over M1 (E)LM and 3J ME(A)T.
>Wayne_Barclay: IT 12H IT +8 212
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DENTTZ G3 Z.D +26 272
#note I need to keep my E here for sure. Not playing ZEE for 32.
>Wayne_Barclay: AEIIMNT M5 INTIMAE +65 277
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ENTTTX N9 EXTaNT +87 359
#note What a big choice here. TEXT for 60 or EXTaNT for 87! I think I made the wrong decision here, but I took the outrunning route. I should have kept my blank and left the board a bit more controlled.
>Wayne_Barclay: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 277
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLOQT 8L Q. +21 380
#note Not sure why I didn't play KITE for 39...
>Wayne_Barclay: BJOS O6 JOBS +44 321
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLNOT O12 LOIN +21 401
#note just to make sure EXTANTS* is not actually a word.
>Wayne_Barclay: GOORRWY 11A W.R. +8 329
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKOORT I10 O.. +3 404
#note didn't know what to do so I decided to see what happened after this.
>Wayne_Barclay: O 12A O. +9 338
#note two spots up for 10
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKORTY 13F YOK +18 422
#note Now I actually almost play YOK at B2, thinking OBAH* was now valid. That would have been hilariously challenged off, remembering last game when Wayne played YOK/KE* and then YAK/KE*! For this endgame, I vow to start seeing the word TIYN. I wasn't focused in this game at all... Really really bad showing, lucky to have won anyway.
>Wayne_Barclay: ?GIIORR E11 sI +20 358
#note Wayne's best play here is the awesome 14B (S)IGlOI!
