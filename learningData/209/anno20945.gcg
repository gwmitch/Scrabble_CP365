#note PARRELs is better for vowel placement reasons, but I was only 90% sure of it.

>Charles_Reinke: ACEILNO I6 ICE +21 93
#note ARECOLINE is a top-100 nine. I studied it once upon a time, but not well enough to see it over the board. There are also THREE double-doubles that I missed. I don't remember even looking for double-doubles.

#note My setup worked so I was eager to use it, however, I did give due consideration to L2 FEME. Column L is a dangerous hotspot, however, playing FEME just moves the hotspot to column M.

>Charles_Reinke: EEFFMTV B1 VET +22 245
#note B3 TEFF was too open for my tastes.

#note I didn't even blink at COM*. If I had stopped to think I would have challenged easily. Only COMM and COMMO got added to our dictionary.
>Charles_Reinke: AEGOQSS J9 OS +20 396
#note Setting up a feeble QI spot if I can draw an I. There are also two U's left. Otherwise, the Q is terrible on this board.

#note AEGNOS works with IIIINRTTT, or half the pool. Jacquelyn probably just exchanged some I's which make my chances better.
