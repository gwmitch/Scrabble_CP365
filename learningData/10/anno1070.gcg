#note There's another cool bingo here that is definitely a better play, ACALEPHE.  Also good without the final E.  I did not know either of them at the time.

#note This might be a significant mistake.  Not able to find any rack cleaning plays I liked, I just grabbed the points.  Sim seems to prefer VOLLEY M9, which has the virtue of cleaning up my rack and setting up S ending bingos.  But with another S and another blank still out, I'm not certain I like playing this way.  There's a safer rack cleaner SYLVA.  Interestingly, the Quack prefers playing it at 10K for 3 fewer points than 3J.  As far as I can see, there are two good reasons for this: 1) with all the back hooks, playing at row 3 gives him the potential for higher scoring plays at O1-O3.  2) putting the S at 10K makes it much more likely for me to get a bingo down with my blank.

#note This and EVILLEST are my only bingos here.  In typical Scrabble player fashion, I didn't even see the common word bingo.  But the Quack thinks that I should not bingo!  The thought briefly occurred to me, but already being short of time and on a board where it might be hard to get any bingos down on the future, I didn't give it much credence.  This is a very strange position, and the sim likes LaV M1 for 26 points.  Strange indeed, because I have another 26 point play SPIV L12 that doesn't burn any blanks.  But the double L leave and the blockage on row 15 seriously reduce my bingo chances.  I totally see the logic of LaV, because I keep pace on the score, and I have a good chance to hit a higher scoring bingo on row 15 with ILS?, but with the other S still out, I'm not sure I agree with the computer.  For sure, the way the tile draw fell, if I had played LaV, he would have played SUQ 15F right away.  Then who knows what the hell would have happened.  But the Quack thinks my winning percentage is about 20 points higher with LaV (89 vs 69).

#note For this and the remaining moves, Randy had less than a minute left.  He played brilliantly.  Admittedly, I was taking up more time, and he had my time to think on.  But still, the way he handled this endgame in desperate time pressure was nothing short of remarkable.  WYND is absolutely necessary here.  He makes it more difficult for me to play my tiles out quickly by blocking WRYING K2 and ERRING 7G.  I spent most of my remaining time (which wasn't much either!) trying to decide what to do in this position, but I failed to grasp the idea Randy had up his sleeve.  The move I chose actually loses.

#note Amazing!  I have no other outs with GN, and SUQ for 40 points on the next turn is totally unblockable.

#note Randy made the final play and stopped the clock with 0 seconds left on his clock.  I had a luxurious 19 seconds left.
