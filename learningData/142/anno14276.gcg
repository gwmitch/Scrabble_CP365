#note Thoughts on this opening rack?

My goal was to make the board as closed as possible, since I'm starting off with a 64-point lead. Playing on the right side and leaving a Q for him to work with accomplishes this pretty well, but was it right to miss the DLS with the D?

#note Can't do anything about it now. I guess if I wanted to be a dick I could have played CARE(ER) to hold him under 300 again. (He underscored one play by 1 somewhere, apparently)
