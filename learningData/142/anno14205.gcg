>Lindsey_Dimmick: ACLW H7 LAW +12 12
#note Lindsey told me post-mortem she had the C in this rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINORV 7D OVER.AIN +63 63
#note The only bingo.  62% to win in a short sim.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ACDI 8A CAID +32 44
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRTZ F6 Z.D +33 96
#note Hmm, an interesting result.  While this is best (this combination of letters makes no 8's), the sim says B8 ADZ is also a very good choice.  Maybe if you know your opponent doesn't have an E, but I think that's a bit of a foolish assumption this early in a game.  Then again, what does Quackle know about her next rack that I don't?
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AGHINRS A8 .RASHING +104 148
>Jim_Burlant: CEINORT 15A .ERONTIC +86 182
#note A few 7's are available but they all score 70 points.  This is clearly best, and it wins 60%.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: DELOP 6J POLED +30 178
>Jim_Burlant: ?DFIOST 10E FOISTeD +69 251
#note Luck box!  At the time I was sure I had missed something better, but a click of the Generate Choices button makes me feel quite happy with this:  this is the only bingo.  
>Lindsey_Dimmick: BY 10A .BY +14 192
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHINY 5K FAY +37 288
#note Any number of strong plays available, but this is best.  YAH, FEY, YEH, and FEH are all good choices too.  91% to win.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: LUV 4M LUV +16 208
>Jim_Burlant: EEHIINN E10 .INE +14 302
#note I had to get one wrong somewhere.  Couldn't think of NIEVE, and there was no way I was going to play HEINIE 11J.  12A HEINIE gives her way too many openings for an easy 7.  That said, if I didn't see NIEVE, there was a slick play that I missed that not only gave nothing back, but it also set up my H for the next turn:  WINE 9H.  And on top of that, it gives me a place to score 30 with my H next turn.  This is mid-pack.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EGM 6B MEG +17 225
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHIKN D11 KEA +26 328
#note Trading a few points for defense.  O1 plays like HEAVE and KNAVE score a few more, but with my lead, this play reduces her most likely bingo line to something for 60 down the N column and the limited line she has at 11I.  I can afford to give up a few extra points.  I'd make this play again, Quackle be damned.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ORT C3 TOR. +8 233
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHINP B2 PEH +23 351
#note Given how easy this board is to defend, I'd rather clamp down with the bag starting to dwindle and force her to have to break up her racks.  Quackle pans this, but given the situation, I'd make this play again.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EW 4B ..WE +20 253
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEINO O1 NAE.I +24 375
#note Ok - now that I don't have anything that can block a crucial line, I might as well take out O1 and score.  This or NAIVE are equally good. 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: BEEIX 8H .XE +24 277
#note She initially put down IBEX E2 before pulling it up and putting this down.
>Jim_Burlant: AELMNOQ G14 Q. +11 386
#note My top equity options are a bunch of plays at 11J that needlessly open up the board.  A1 MOL or NOM are possibilities, but given how Q-unfriendly this board was, I felt I had to dump the Q now.   I have enough of a lead that I can get away with this.  Screw quackle.  
>Lindsey_Dimmick: JTU A1 JUT +37 314
>Jim_Burlant: AELMNOU N1 UM +18 404
#note Just in case I've mistracked and she has an 8 on row 1 or 2.  Again, Q loves these 11I plays that open up all sorts of lines for her.  No thanks.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: IO B10 .IO +12 326
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNOO 3E ANOA +7 411
#note Despite how much Quackle loathes this play, this was the best thing I could have put down at this time:  she had BRUISER ready to go.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?BERRSU H2 B. +4 330
>Jim_Burlant: EGLOSTT 1G GOT +27 438
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?EIRRSU N6 .URRIESt +60 390
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?EIRRSU --  -60 330
#note The only bingo here is DhURRIES.
>Jim_Burlant: ELST 11J LETS +15 453
#note As far as I'm concerned, the only play I really missed was FINE, but the draw was kind enough to let me recover from that mistake.  As for the rest of the game - once I had the lead, I was more than happy to play defensively when almost every play I made both outscored her and shut down an easy line. Despite Quackle's opinion, I'm content with how I played this one.
