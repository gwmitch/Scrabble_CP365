#note I wasn't sure if POKIER was a play I should consider here. Q says it's almost 10 points down, so that's good.

#note Y(E)AN is surprisingly winning this sim despite its leave of EOOZ. WAZOO is really just a play I shouldn't miss, too. Bleh. -11

#note She spent a really long time on this play, which telegraphed to me that she had a blank. I asked her after the game and she confirmed this. 
>Matt_Canik: ABGIIOT 8L B.AT +27 286
#note Because I think she has the blank, I'm gonna try and frustrated her as much as I can by opening as little as possible... of course, I think BETA accomplishes that better than BEAT does. Fail. 
>Becky_Dyer: ?FGINUU O4 UNFI. +9 250
#note She told me that she had FUGUIN? this turn. 
>Matt_Canik: EGIIORT N10 OI +10 296
#note Ow. OI N5. I even noticed the spot for PITON. 
>Becky_Dyer: OY 1N OY +17 267
>Matt_Canik: AEEGIRT C7 .IG +15 311
#note I don't feel too bad about opening this because I have an A. 
>Becky_Dyer: ?CGISTU 10C SCUT +22 289
#note And she said this was her rack here. 
>Matt_Canik: AEEHRTU 11E HAUT +26 337
#note Seems marginally better than HAE. 
>Becky_Dyer: AH C3 HA. +26 315
>Matt_Canik: ADEEPRR 3C .ARPED +13 350
#note I can't see a play she'll make that will outrun me, and she can't bingo.
