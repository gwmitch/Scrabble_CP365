>Rafi: ABEHNNO F4 NOH +27 101
#note Thought about OBEAH/BOHEA plays, but the NN leave is not worth the points.

>Rafi: ABEENNU D11 NABE +20 121
#note Tough decision. I considered UNBE/RE and BUNA/ASH. I looked through the L forever, but there's nothing there. The sim winner is a play I didn't see - BUNA overlapping NOH. It looks pretty good to me - I have one of the NU hooks and can probably use the spot more easily than Robin. NABE gives up a little too much - I was hoping to get an overreaction block but most blocks involve playing OBE which scores well anyway. I'm only down 36... I think I was trying to create too much after so many games where I'm playing catchup.

#note Didn't see USHERING which scores an extra point.

>Rafi: AIOOTUY 15A YU. +30 261
#note I deliberated on this play for a while, considering TOYO, (L)OYA(L), AUK, AUTO,  and YUK (but not YOK for some reason). I really need to play LOYAL here to get rid of an extra vowel - the U is not terrible because there's only one unseen and an unseen Q.

>Rafi: AIOOOPT H12 .OOP +21 282
#note Maybe PATIO. PO(N)TOO(N) is pretty cool.
>Robin: ?CEEEIR O4 CREEpIE +88 409
#note I give up. 
>Rafi: AILOORT G2 OO. +7 289
#note Not sure what to do here... going for CRAFTILY or LITERARY or something to the Y. Chose against OO(T) because then both lanes can be blocked.
>Robin: AZ 2E AZ. +32 441
>Rafi: AFILNRT N6 FA +28 317
#note Maybe I can draw AE or EE and bingo to the Y.
