#note I was pretty excited to play this kid for the first time!
>Mack_Meller: DEIILOS E5 LIO.ISED +86 86
>JD: FJMNNRV 6D J.NN +13 87
#note this was a bad decision. FMRV is way too clunky.
>Mack_Meller: ?AAFINR J2 FARINAs +80 166
>JD: FIMMRSV 3I F.VISM +36 123
#note exchanging last turn would've left me much better positioned to try to retaliate this turn instead of cleaning up junk.
>Mack_Meller: AYY D11 YAY +29 195
>JD: CEIMPRU 2M UMP +28 151
#note I saw some options like MU at C13 or PERM at C10 for points. I wasn't crazy about blocking my nice lanes at the top-right but the board is pretty open. CEIPR has a lot of potential too. in the end they're all pretty close.
>Mack_Meller: ABO C11 ABO +32 227
>JD: CEIRUVW H5 WIV. +22 173
>Mack_Meller: IORT L1 TR.O +18 245
#note blocking the hottest spot on the board
>JD: CEGHRSU B13 HUG +23 196
#note I debated playing WHIG instead but it seemed like I needed to fork the board open more. quackle much prefers WHIG. I think I agree - this just gives up some easy points to mack and lets him block YAYS.

>JD: CEENRSX K5 SEX +35 231
#note yeahhh
>Mack_Meller: ?AEEEOT A10 TOEA +15 290
#note nice play keeping the board tight, I think he had the blank he said later

#note nice play
>JD: CEEENOR -  +0 269
#note at this point in the tournament I basically had to win to cash, so I challenged. 
>Mack_Meller: EGILORZ -EGIL +0 415
#note interestingly, he didn't have the Q when he made this exchange.
>JD: CEEENOR 9G ORE +22 291
#note I missed a chance to make things interesting by playing CEE at B1. I'm down too much for it to really work but it must be worth playing.
>Mack_Meller: OS O1 O.S +30 445
#note smart idea to take the points
>JD: ACEENOT 14E ACETONE +72 363
>Mack_Meller: EGILRTT D1 GRIT +23 468
#note I have a guaranteed 60 point play next turn regardless of where he plays!
