>JD: EHILNST 8G HIN +12 12
#note exchange? play through? seems like it's pretty close...in retrospect I would like to have gone for exchange H or L
>Jason_Keller: ABEHM 7F BEMAH +27 27
>Jason_Keller: ABEHM --  -27 0
>JD: DEILSTT F8 SLITTED +71 83
#note always tough to make the right move after a phony - SLITTED at J2 looks best to me though since it gives up nothing obvious. Given all the information I have it sims 2 better than my choice.
>Jason_Keller: ABEM E10 BEAM +30 30
>JD: OOOORYZ J5 OOZY +29 112
#note oozy gives up a lot of points next turn but so does ZOO, and ROMEO doesn't look all that great either...I think I'll take OOZY since it starts closing the board down more.

#note yay usually I miss this word!
>Jason_Keller: ACCENST D1 ACCENTS +82 203
>JD: ADILNOT 2B AL.ID +24 233
#note I'm baffled by the sim results which show AD and ADO at G12 absolutely crushing the sim. do I really bingo twice as often (23% -> 45%) after keeping ILNOT instead of NOT? Is it because AILNOT is so good for 8s? anyone understand?
>Jason_Keller: IJNO 5I J.IN +34 237
>JD: EENOPRT 3K PEON +31 264
#note REPOT sims a little better than PEON, I think because there are lots of Rs left
>Jason_Keller: ERV 2M REV +21 258
>JD: EERRTUY 1C E.TERY +34 298
#note this made me happy
>Jason_Keller: AF E4 FA +19 277
>JD: DEORTUV B10 OVERT +24 322
#note trying to flip over tiles without playin UNDEVOUT which seems to give him too many lanes to work with...in actuality though his bingo percentage is the same after UNDEVOUT or OVERT (the best lane is column L), and hence the two plays sim the same (worse leave but more points for OVERT)
>Jason_Keller: ?AEGGNS L7 SNAGGEd +82 359
>JD: ADEILUX A12 DEIL +30 352
#note keep the X and prevent him from killing me here with a cheap B- play
>Jason_Keller: A 9F .A +9 368
>JD: ABEGRUX M8 AX +36 388
#note I thought there wasn't much I could do besides taking the points and hoping he misses, but I don't know how true that is...even with the blank the pool is such that he easily could've just missed his fish. BURGAGE, AG, MEG and AGE all pop up on the sim and look like they have a chance. No idea how to choose between them.
>Jason_Keller: AEIIRST I7 ..ITARIES +61 429
>Jason_Keller: AEIIRST --  -61 368
#note not a bad try, but he may have had some other winning chances here
>JD: ?BEGRUU 10J BU. +12 400
#note DUG at 14F to set up OUREBI is pretty nifty
