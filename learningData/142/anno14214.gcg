#note My bingos are all cheapies at G8 which give a lot back to him, so it seemed worth it to delay bingoing and set up something bigger.

#note STUDY 8K is perhaps enough points to be worth taking right away, as he's likely to hit the spot if he has his own S.  But this is quite reasonable too.
>Chris_Lipe: EY 2M YE +19 209
>Dave_Koenig: ADDLSTT A13 DAD +24 245
#note F10 ADD, which I did not see, scores one more point and keeps the S hook on row 15 open, though it also leaves A13-15 open for him.
>Chris_Lipe: ERU 3L RUE +21 230
>Dave_Koenig: DILSSTT E7 .....ST +18 263
#note Maybe STILT 8K, but I was hoping to hit that spot or O3-O8 with something bigger.

>Dave_Koenig: ADILSTW 8K SWAIL +43 306
>Chris_Lipe: EGHINNR N8 .NHERING +90 325
#note Frustrating.  Not only does he score huge on this bingo, but my rack is completely unequipped to deal with the O15 opening.
>Dave_Koenig: CDIPRRT 11J PRIC.D +22 328
>Chris_Lipe: ATU O13 TAU +22 347
>Dave_Koenig: CGGORTV L10 V.G +14 342
#note I was trying to set myself up for COG M11 on the next turn.  Apparently I messed up this endgame pretty bad though, because Quackle has this at only 13.26% to win as opposed to VICTOR for 26.82% and IGG for 20.61%.
>Chris_Lipe: AL 13L AL.. +16 363
#note I could tell Chris has the case S when he did this, and with it it's a very strong play.  Now I thought that I was lost no matter what because either he has WINDLES or the X, which he will score well with.
>Dave_Koenig: CFGOORT J11 .RO +5 347
#note Turns out the obvious play FORCE is the right way to go here, and I actually squeak out a win if I draw the E, though everything else loses.  I misjudged the situation and tried to block his bingo line and big X spot while setting my F up, but I forgot about the W hook.
>Chris_Lipe: EILNSWX 14J WIS +40 403
#note Apparently just dropping the W for PROW here, to set up SILEX/PROWL is best, though this wins easily enough.
>Dave_Koenig: CDFGOT 6I .D. +8 355
#note The idea is to take away 6L for the X and force him to put it somewhere I can score off of it, but ICED was the better way to do this.
>Chris_Lipe: ELNX H8 .XEN +11 414
#note We both missed the best spot for his X: O2.  But it's only bookkeeping at this point.
>Dave_Koenig: CFGOT F13 OFT +16 371
#note Best is the simple OF 8A, though COINHERING is worth a few style points.
