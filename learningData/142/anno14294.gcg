#note I'm so good at drawing blanks. At this point i had drawn 12/12.
>Lou_Cornelis: EEEFZ 12C FEEZE. +38 198
#note feeze 11B is one more and not any more dangerous. With this play, lou has to worry about za underlaps as well as high scoring plays making fiz or fez... I don't know the rest of lou's rack though so I can't really say for sure that feeze is better.

>Bnjy: AGILNPR 4B PAR.LING +74 249
#note I wasn't 100% sure on pearling and wanted to play the word i was sure of... This quadrant is less dangerous to open anyways so paroling isn't that much worse than pearling.
>Lou_Cornelis: IX 6N XI +53 279
#note noting the possibily of mixer plays.
>Bnjy: AACENSV 8A CAVES +49 298
#note Brain fart on the (mom)e hook. cave is better since it saves the s for a quoters play next turn.
>Lou_Cornelis: BKO 3A KOB +30 309
>Bnjy: AAGINTY O1 YAGI +36 334
#note Quackle wants me to play yak. why??? Bingoing isn't important right now. I need to keep tempo on him and this is clearly the best way to do it.
>Lou_Cornelis: JT M7 J.T +19 328
#note I get a big break here, as lou doesn't have an e to play jet 3k.

>Bnjy: EIIPRSU K11 PIER +24 408
#note qi sims best by a large marin. It's more likely to end badly against a human opponent, but it might still be right?

#note douse is 9 better... I just wanted to win
