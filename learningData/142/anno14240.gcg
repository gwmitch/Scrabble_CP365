#note so far, just keeping it tight and waiting for the action to kick in
>Dean_Saldanha: FNU J6 FU. +14 137
>JD: ADNORRS N12 NARD +18 125
#note I underestimated how many points NARD gives back - more even than a play like DURO leaving the O in the triple-lane. I don't like any of the other options that much but this just isn't defensive enough
>Dean_Saldanha: AENOPT 15H NOTEPA. +39 176
#note whoa!
>JD: AEEIORS O14 ES +41 166
#note just playing ariose also blocks the triple and doesn't leave me stuck with vowelitis

#note I am in a lot of trouble
>JD: GLLNNOR M2 ROLL +22 263
#note the leave after GORP was so incredibly bad that I didn't feel like I could play it, but quackle actually thinks GNN and LLNN fare about equally on this board. I guess the COWL/MIL overlap is very unlikely to get blocked.
