>Rafi: AGSTTVW -GTVW +0 0
#note I like trading better than VAW here, although it's definitely pretty close. VAW wins the sim.
>Lisa_Odom: OPU 8F UPO +10 10
>Rafi: AJRRSST 7H JARS +21 21
#note This was a weird spot - I'm obviously telegraphing the S by making this play as opposed to JAR. However, UPO was a fish so Lisa is going to have an S more often than average, and RSST bingoes less often than RST. I can also play JARS on the other side for the same score, but I wanted to block the N hook. JARS/US wins the sim even with an N inference, probably because I'm going to bingo more often and because JARS opens up a lane for 5s to the triple.

#note Earlier in the tournament I made the mistake of exchanging 7 with both blanks unseen instead of exchanging 6 leaving an E. This time it makes sense though because there are fewer tiles unseen and I need to bingo to have a shot.
>Lisa_Odom: IX D4 XI +41 236
>Rafi: ?EINQRT 14A QI +26 174
#note I'm not a big fan of QI/OI, but I couldn't stomach playing QI for 15 fewer points blocking the best bingo lanes. I am giving up a lot of points to Lisa here, but the board position is pretty awful after the other QI. My thoughts were that QI for 33 isn't going to kill me - Lisa needs an L to deliver the deathblow. Quackle strongly prefers Q(I) for 11 in a sim, but championship player (run multiple times) cannot decide between the two. QUIT/QUIN also sims pretty close.
>Lisa_Odom: EMRY N2 MER.Y +40 276
#note I picked this bingo because of the S hook and the lower chance of a big parallel play to the double. The parallel option might be a benefit though - I'm not so far behind that I need to bingo again if I can hit a couple 30-50 point plays.
>Rafi: ?AEENRT O6 EARNEsT +76 250
#note I chose this bingo over the other 76-pointers because of the S hook and the lower likelihood of a big overlap to the double. However, it's possible that leaving overlap opportunities is a good thing, as a couple 40-50 point plays gets me back in the game.

>Rafi: BCHNPSW K11 .H.W +10 352
#note This was one of the toughest plays of the tournament for me. Is it time to open something up or do I wait? If Lisa has the blank I suspect she will use it to block my hook. Also, I(D)EA blocks, and there are many partial blocks as well. THEW simply doesn't have enough firepower behind it and is too easy to block - I need to wait and play something like WONT/NOWT and hope to draw some vowels.
