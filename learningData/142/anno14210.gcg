>Mack: EFI 9G FIE +28 28
>Rafi: ?EIMPRV -MV +0 20
#note I debated between exch. V and MV. My reasoning was that IMPER? doesn't bingo enough ending in S. Looking more closely, IMPER? bingoes very well hooking FE, and most of Mack's blocks will open up other bingo options, such as a more usable S hook. IMPER? will also score better than PIER? when I do bingo.
>Mack: IIIII -IIIII +0 28
>Rafi: ?EIPRRY 10I RYE +20 40
#note Quackle hates this play, and I can see why. I'm opening up good options for Mack when previously the board was deadlocked. FEY looks strong here, giving me adequate bingo chances hooking WOOF and giving little back to Mack. YIRR also sims well.

#note Mack wasn't sure of SHADInGS here. DISHrAGS is also available.
>Rafi: BEIINRT 6F .IB +12 167
#note This was a hard decision for me. It seemed like there should have been a decent overlap through the A or above HAG, but no matter what I play there I leave two I's. BINGO isn't good positionally, opening up a nice bingo lane. JIB actually sims best here... I was concerned that it was overly fishy but I guess there isn't anything better.

#note ING is pretty pointless on this board, so CONGAS is better than CONGO.
>Mack: ABINR 13B .ARBIN. +32 315
>Rafi: IKNOSTU E10 KNO. +20 383
#note It confuses me why blocking the only real bingo lane doesn't sim best. I know I can lose to a Z play + other misfortune, but it would require more thought to win than simply drawing a bingo.

#note Considered DISPUTER/STUPIDER - doesn't make a huge difference.
