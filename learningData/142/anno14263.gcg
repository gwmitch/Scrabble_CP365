#note OUTVALUE is also available with this otherwise unpromising rack.
>Alyssa: CNN 2H C.NN +8 36
>Rafi: EEEIQRR 7E QI +16 82
#note EERIE is better. 4 more points in addition to taking out a good scoring spot makes up for leaving the Q, and EEERR isn't that great either.
>Alyssa: FOST L2 SOFT +21 57
>Rafi: EEEEORR K5 ERE +10 92
#note SOFT telegraphs an S leave, so I think J4 ORE is better. Three extra points without opening up the only good bingo lane for 7s makes up for leaving EEER instead of EEOR.

#note I didn't notice how consonant heavy the pool is at this point (12v 26c) which makes plays like POI and OI more valuable than I expected.

>Rafi: ?BEINTV J12 N.B +11 200
#note Quackle likes VIBE opening the triple triple, but that will almost never work. Most of Quackle's other top choices do not create anything new. I think I have to play NIB to give my self a chance - I need a big bingo on the triple.

#note This was probably my favorite play of the tournament, sneakily setting up HIKED for 60 if I draw an H. If Alyssa sacrifices points to block the bingo lane, then HIKED might be enough to win an occasional endgame. Quackle likes other plays better (like GOOKY and PAWKY) but I doubt those will win as often as PAWED against a human opponent.
>Alyssa: AHLOT 3C LOATH +34 396
>Rafi: DIKNOOY 4C OY +22 335
#note With no guaranteed win available and Alyssa under some time pressure, I decided to go for the slight chance that she would play HI to give me HIKED for 52 and the win.

#note Didn't realize until after the game that KI first is 6 points better.

#note Almost, but not quite. If I had drawn HI instead of IN then I would have had a win available.
