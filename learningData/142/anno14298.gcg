#note Thought long and hard here about ENTERICS but was not 100% sure.  I liked the placement better.

My last game again Karl,  I had a trip-trip too and he won.  So I'm holding out hope here.

#note Did not like my leave here and I guess that I underestimated keeping the "E"

#note I almost played VINO at D1 but I wanted to block the bingo to the G - good thing I did too.
>Karl_H: AEHILNS N6 INHALES +71 379
#note Now, here is where it all goes downhill.  Karl and I think that I could have won this end game.
>Bill_P: EIOPRRU 13K PIE +29 434
#note PIE scores a lot and but does not leave me an out in one.

I also undervalued my out in two - almost any play using the G at 2K wins.

Missed ROUE at M5.  That would have blocked his best play - but I was worred about a Z play at B2
