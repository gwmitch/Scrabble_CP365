>Vera_Bigall: ?AAENRU 8B UNAwARE +64 64
#note Drat. Only bingo.
>Matthew: AACIOSY G6 AI.Y +12 12
#note This performs weak in the sim. Maybe because of F6?

>Vera_Bigall: LLW 6F W.LL +15 79
>Matthew: ABCOORS 5B CARBO +23 35
#note Walla is not a word I know. This is about 3% down
>Vera_Bigall: ?DEPPRT 4F TRiPPED +78 157
#note Drat.
>Matthew: DEFLORS 5K FOLD +29 64
#note I MADE THE BEST MOVE! I DID IT! I DID IT!
>Vera_Bigall: UX 3H XU +23 180
>Matthew: EEIORSZ O1 ZEROS +54 118
#note SIZE? guess so.
>Vera_Bigall: DHU 3K DUH +25 205
>Matthew: EEIIMOO -EIIMOO +0 118
#note Lots of stuff close, MOIRE and LOOIE are the only ones perhaps playing through.
>Vera_Bigall: EINW B2 WIN.E +24 229
>Matthew: DEFGJNV 3A J.VED +32 150
#note (J)UDO dummy and JEFE.
>Vera_Bigall: ABCK D8 .BACK +26 255
>Matthew: EFGNOTT 11D .OFT +18 168
#note Another bottleneck. I tried to open something up without just giving her 35 points on the triple.
>Vera_Bigall: EG 10D .GE +16 271
>Matthew: EEGHNST J6 SHEET +22 190
#note This is, of course, low equity, but I feel it's necessary given my super dire situation. None of the moves above this opening anything up except for the triple, so I've moved on from hoping to praying.
>Vera_Bigall: EIISV K10 IVIES +18 289
>Matthew: AEGINNO 14E ANGINO.E +63 253
#note Nice draw! She held but only because she thought I played AGINOSE.
>Vera_Bigall: ENO 15G ONE +20 309
>Matthew: AMRRTTY 15L MATY +43 296
#note At this tournament I'm pretending to know my 4s. Clearly I don't. This isn't even best. TRYMA, a word I didn't know, is much better.
>Vera_Bigall: EIOU M5 .OUIE +7 316
>Matthew: EGNRRST 12H STR.NGER +72 368
#note The blank in TRIPPED was an E but I'm too lazy to change that now. In other words, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA. The praying worked!
>Vera_Bigall: AIIILOQT L8 QAT +48 364
>Matthew: AM 14N AM +19 387
#note I thought about MA(Xi) earlier. Donno why I missed it, I had 17 minutes left.
