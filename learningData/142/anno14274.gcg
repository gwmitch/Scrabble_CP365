>Joshua_Sokol: ABEELPY H4 BELAY +26 26
#note Silly start for me...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?ADELPS 5G R.DONATE +68 68
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?ADELPS --  -68 0
#note Bernard said he was thinking of something else, but we couldn't figure out what.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEHPSZ G7 ZAP +53 79
#note I guess the silly placement still worked out for me!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADENORT F8 DO +14 14
#note Either this or NOD. I prefer NOD personally

>Joshua_Sokol: CHNOSWW 10D WOW +32 171
#note Using my S was worth it here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: GLNR E9 L.NG +15 103
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEHNSS 10D ...S +25 196
#note It's worth it this time too :P
>Bernard_Gotlieb: FOR L2 FOR +31 134
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEHINS 5E ACH. +18 214
#note Ah, AH... Missed ABIDER there for a second.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ILP 2L .LIP +18 152
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINST 13C DESTINE +76 290
#note Took me way too long to see this. Didn't see TACHE either, but that hook can wait.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?GIMNTU D13 .MU +6 158
#note He saw both TUMPING and MUSTING and chickened out on both. MUNTING was news for both of us. This move isn't that bad though, since he has a blank that could triple-triple in two places now.
>Joshua_Sokol: CENORSS M1 C.OSER +33 323
#note SPEC is safest here, and throwing off one of the S's with BELAYS is strong as well. Nowhere for CENSORS unfortunately...
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?GIINOT O2 .OInTING +83 241
#note You see it? You see it? Bernard didn't. Though he didn't look for it quite long enough. Yup, OPIATING for 140, though I still would have been ahead, crazily enough. Man, two 3x3s in a row would have been awesome! Oops! Spoilers!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABLMNS 15A ALB.MeNS +149 472
#note :D

Took me a bit, but I was patient enough to see it. ALB(U)MiNS too.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEEINRU -  +0 241
#note Challenged, which makes sense even if you're 99% sure in this situation.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRTTUU D3 TUTU +18 490
#note There's that T(ACHE) hook I missed earlier. Look, it even baited a challenge!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEEINRU -  +0 241
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJNORT 3B JO. +20 510
#note Missed JA(LOP). I was hesitation between JOT and JEU however, since there were a lot of E's in the bag yet to be seen.
