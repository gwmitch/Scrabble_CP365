#note augh somehow I persuaded myself that OVARIAL was phony...volatility isn't bad here but ovarial would've been better

#note burns through a lot of tiles but I need points to have a shot...I could still hit the V for a bingo and win. I could also play NUBIA at 9J to set up the S hook but I think I need the points

#note she laid down AIRSHOTS first then switched it
>JD: DDEENOS I2 DEED +20 327
#note well, I am screwed, but looking at it now my best chance is probably taking QIS and then hoping I can bingo after alyssa plays AIRSHOTS, and then maybe hoping she falls asleep in her chair or something after that. I thought I could block all her bingos this way, but
