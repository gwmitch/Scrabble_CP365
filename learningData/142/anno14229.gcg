#note rafi: "I liked the board position after this bingo - if Jesse overlaps the E, I can re-overlap and start to close the board early." note that any comments without a preface are by me (jd)
>JD: EFHLMNO 9G HOME +36 36
#note rafi came up with a nice suggestion of FLEHMEN after the game which would really force the board to stay open. but actually I think the solution here is something like FOH at 9I that really makes the board a lot more dynamic. HOME gives up a lot of cheap points and allows him to really lock things down early...taking the points here is probably fine but against a player as good and strategically cunning as rafi I like FOH.
>Rafi: AEILTWY 10H YEW +42 112
#note rafi actually had SWEATILY if I didn't block but this is a nice position for him
>JD: ADEFLNR D4 FLAN.ED +24 60
#note this is kind of the worst-case scenario but I could've avoided it by playing something like FOH before. I like what FLANGED does to the board quite a lot, but it does burn up some good letters. the only reasonable alternative that quackle comes up with is FA at 7F, but after he plays at 6G I don't have much to work with...
>Rafi: AFGILOT C9 FAGOT +38 150
>JD: EEIIORY D12 YORE +28 88
#note what to do? exchange? OILY at 5B? I discarded OILY because it seemed to close lanes that I needed. YORE seems to sim ok. quackle also comes up with EYRIE at C1 or OILIER at 5B. Keeping the Y is a great idea because I can play it at 11J next turn to create a new lane in a place that will otherwise be hard to open up. My pick is OILIER, which is kind of a tough find over the board.
>Rafi: DEEIILS 6A IDE.LISE +65 215
>JD: BEEIIOR -  +0 88
#note regardless of what happens I'm in a lot of trouble, but the percentages are something like this: 20% chance of winning for me if it comes off, about a 6% chance if I leave it, and <1% if I lose the challenge. IDEALISE looked pretty weird to me. I thought it had about a 75% chance of being good or so.
>Rafi: ACHLRSV 15A HAV.R +33 248
#note rafi: "Lots of close plays here - I was going for a bingo leave or HAVERELS for next turn. CHIRAL, CHAIRS, ARCHILS and VAILS win the sim by a tad."
>JD: BEEIIOR C2 BIO +15 103
#note I really like BIRLE at 5A threatening the crazy 3x3.
>Rafi: BCEELSU A5 B.CE +24 272
>JD: EEIKNOR 2A KI.E +20 123
#note I'm not really ever going to win from this position, but if I want to bingo quackle likes LEK a little better - I think quackle overestimates the chances of my lanes staying open tho

#note yikes last game of the day, wheels fell off I guess. I have aleuron at E5 for the sick 2x2.

#note rafi: "I have the last E, but CUTIE/GUIDE blocks two bingo lanes after multiple fishing plays. DOG goes for spread though, so either play is fine."

#note rafi: "Wanted to save the last E, but couldn't see anything else worth playing."
>JD: AILNOPR 3I PIN.A +20 276
#note this play sucks. I had some kind of logic for doing this that now utterly escapes me.

#note ROW at 14D is one extra point.

#note in spite of this game not going very well for me, I actually had quite a few interesting decisions to make early. some better choices may have given me more of a fighting chance.
