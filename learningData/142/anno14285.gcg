#note And then Ian plunks this down in about .3 seconds. It didn't look familiar so I held but couldn't bring myself to challenge. It's # btw.

#note Maybe DAFT, but that doesn't give me an S hook. I think after WELL and DAFT, Ian will consider sacrificing points to block the MU lane, although DAFT leaves the I open to play though. Hard to say though - I guess RUST is a little better than STD despite the U?

#note Another bad part about this game is that Ian is playing super fast, and this turn has so many options. Saw CERIC leaving MOZ for the chance at MATZO next turn, but for some reason couldn't remember if CERIC was a word (FERIC* is the phoney). CROZE is pretty good... CIM is much more bingo prone than CCEMO especially with all the A's and E's unseen. ZOIC and COZIE (row 5) are good plays too, but CROZE wins the sim.

#note Getting low on time. This is a turn that could have used more time... I played MIX much more quickly than I would have liked. MOTEY is a pretty nice play, setting up the 53 point AX(I)TE if I draw an E. The X is huge here, so I should score 33 and save it for next turn.

#note I didn't see TEAPOY winning many games, but my play surely doesn't either. I guess I can win if Ian blocks column B and I draw something like HOWLS/JUBAS in the endgame. Quackle laughably believes I'm going to bingo 10% of the time after TEAPOY. Not sure what PLOY accomplishes except for playing fewer tiles.

>Rafi: ABEHSTT B2 H. +20 390
#note I'm pretty sure I can't win here. I was also super low on time - my goal was to not empty the bag and pray that Ian messes up somehow.
