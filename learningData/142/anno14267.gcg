#note 10C SPAZ sims best, slightly better than WALTZ.  I didn't see it over the board, but I'm not sure if I would have played it.   I mean, I would have played SPAZ had I known Andrew's rack.  But that's hindsight.  I do like the defense of SPAZ, though.
>Andrew: ABEGLNS F7 S.NGABLE +67 110
#note Wait a second, SPAZ would have given him BANGLES for a million points. So I defnitely would NOT have played SPAZ had I known his rack.  Or at least I hope not.

#note After I thankfully talked myself out of FORECEPS*, I went back and forth between this and 4L OF.  I played FORE because OF messes up column N and I thought EPS? is better than EEPS?.   Now that I'm looking at this, though, I shouldn't be worried about column N.  I'm ahead by enough and OF just makes it harder for Andrew, not me.  And I could still hit 8s elsewhere.

#note .....I am such a dingbat.  This plays at B9 for 85!!!    If I'm going to play on column N, SUPPOSE is better.   I didn't see SUPPOSE, though.   I was convinced the only bingos were UPSLOPE and PURPOSE.

#note Andrew took a long time with this play.  
>Tasha: ACDEINV 15J VA.NED +30 377
#note And I took a long time with this.  Quackle recommends O1 VINE or VINA, but I don't like those plays.  Normally I would play VINA  in a heart beat, but there's a reason Andrew played MINION instead of O1 MINI so I'm going to be annoying and thwart any plans he has for row 15.  If that's the case, though, DIVAN is better; I considered it, and I have no idea why I didn't play it.  DIVAN essentially takes out any 8s on row 14 and CEN is better than CI.

#note Pretty!
>Tasha: CEILNOU A7 CUIN. +24 401
#note Normally, I would play CLUEING, but the pool is ugly as hell and CLUEING would empty the bag. I didn't want to leave myself with OE with a pool that looked like AAEEIIOUVY.   Maybe I should have played CUEING.  I think I chickened out on the E spelling, despite knowing CLUEING is good.

#note Seriously, do I mentally fall alseep during endgame or what?  So I noticed the hotspot at K11, but I only saw VID and BO.  I forgot ID also takes a Y.   I still considered playing AA there, but I ultimately just decided to ignore the spot altogether.  Bad, bad decision.

#note What if this was a final tournament game where I had to win by 40 to take first place??    This is the very last time I'm jacking up an endgame.  Okay so I forgot about UTA and YID.  I'm going to start treating Scrabble like multi-question tests.  Just go with your first instinct.  It's always right.
