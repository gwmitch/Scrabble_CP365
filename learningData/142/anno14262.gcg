>Rafi: DIMORTU 8D DIMOUT +22 22
#note Fatigue is setting in now. Couldn't remember if ODIUM was a word, and didn't see DUOMI.
>Stefan: ACEILPS J2 PLAICES +83 83
>Rafi: GIIOORT 2J .IROG +16 38
#note Trying to make something happen. I think this is better than PIROGI - Stefan needs an A or an I to score as opposed to being able to play through a hanging I. LOGOI also sims well.
>Stefan: EFH 9E FEH +31 114
>Rafi: AIINOTT O1 TITI +24 62
#note I didn't notice TITIAN until after the play. Ugh.
>Stefan: BDEI L1 B.IDE +22 136
>Rafi: AAFNNOR 10F NONA +19 81
>Stefan: ?EISTUV 11I STUIVEr +70 206
#note There is a sick double-double available!
>Rafi: AAFGIRT 10N FA +27 108
#note FERIA is too easy to block. I really considered FAR 7C to open a bingo lane on the left side, but decided to go for the points - plus I might have an outside chance at drawing a non-bingo triple-triple later. FA wins the sim.
>Stefan: Q 4N Q. +11 217
>Rafi: AGIKLRT L8 GLA.KIT +28 136
#note Too bad there weren't any double-doubles ending in LIKE. This is another morbid position... ARGALI and GLAIKIT are simming best, along with KALIF and KRA(I)T. Not sure how best to go about trying to win this game, but GLAIKIT seems as good as anything else.
>Stefan: AERWY 14J WA.ERY +40 257
>Rafi: ACEGLLR 15F GLACE +29 165
#note I can see why LAGER and GLARE sim better than GLACE... I have a chance at drawing EHS for CHARLEYS! I was looking for something like that...

#note S(PA)Z/SHOE is hard to spot, and the only other Z play.
