>Matthew_Larocque: AACENNX 8H ANNEX +40 40
#note I forgot that this takes an E hook. This obviously comes into play later.
>Mike_Ebanks: IOV J6 VI.O +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFORUZ 7F COZ +26 66
#note Sim likes 7L AZO but I prefer the defensive option here. I don't see OCA panning out as a Z setup.
>Mike_Ebanks: HPY 9F HYP +29 44
>Matthew_Larocque: AFORSUW K7 F.W +19 85
#note I just plain didn't catch (V)ROUW to create the S set-up. I'm still misguided in thinking the board is crap because of my neglect to remember the E-hook.
>Mike_Ebanks: ANTU 10C TUNA +13 57
>Matthew_Larocque: AELORSU E10 .U +4 89
#note I missed ROULEAUS, and ROSULATE  isn't even familiar to me.... this miss sucked because it would have blocked his bingo.
>Mike_Ebanks: ADEEIMN C5 DEMEN.IA +65 122
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILORS 13C LO +28 117
#note I was about 75% sure this was valid and seemed like Mike might have to think about it. There's no bingos now, but sim likes OIL better. He might not challenge if I open up a big scoring spot though.
>Mike_Ebanks: DQU -  +0 122
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIORSS D2 ARIOSES +78 195
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIORSS --  -78 117
#note Thought maybe Mike would let me have this after losing his turn....
>Mike_Ebanks: DQU 12A QU.D +54 176
#note Crap.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIORSS 10H SO +17 134
#note Fishing again, but without knowing the most obvious line this isn't going to end well.
>Mike_Ebanks: UV -UV +0 176
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILRSS 14D SAILERS +65 199
#note 16 more points on the M column. 
>Mike_Ebanks: AKS H12 KA.S +39 215
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIJOY 8A JO.Y +54 253
>Mike_Ebanks: HOP A12 .OPH +54 269
#note Ok, that was unnecessary, Mike!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIILOT 11I IOLITEs +64 317
#note Ugh.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?AENRRT M3 TRAiNER +79 348
#note Oh yeaaaaaah....
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGIORT B2 AROID +30 347
#note I didn't write this down entirely but I think this is correct, which means I would have missed GORDITA(s). I'm really not on point this game.
>Mike_Ebanks: BGIRT N10 B.GIRT +30 378
>Matthew_Larocque: DFGGIIT 12J DIF +29 376
>Mike_Ebanks: ACERV O6 CRAVE. +34 412
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGGITU 3A G.UB +14 390
#note I saw BUGGIE(R) after making this lame play.
>Mike_Ebanks: EELMNTW 4L W.EN +16 428
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEGIT 4D AGEE +18 408
#note 15C TEG to prevent him from playing out.
>Mike_Ebanks: ELMT 3G MELT +17 445
>Mike_Ebanks:  (EIT) +6 451
#note -10. I'm pretty sure I won't whiff that hook ever again.
