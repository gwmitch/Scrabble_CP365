#note HERE COMES THE SCRUBBAGGING!!!
>Winter: AABINOR L2 ABRI +26 111
#note Don't really want to block the T line, but I need the points and don't want to give up the counterplay that BRAIN would.

>Winter: INNNSUX N4 SIX +59 197
#note If I can survive this leave I might have a chance.
>Mike_Fleck: AII 8K .A.II +18 228
#note Another breather--whew.
>Winter: AENNNOU F3 NONA +11 208
#note Not that I can do much better. I really look at the 14 row like Q wants, but I decide it is too dangerous--if I'm getting scrubbagged, chances are good he has the S or blanks. I know NONA gives up counterplays, but I want the turnover too.

#note WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT THIS SCRUB LUCK!!! IF HE HAD PLAYED IT RIGHT I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD!!!
>Winter: BFINOSZ 4D ZO.N +26 341
#note DAMN!!! Can't play FOB b/c of FONdLER!!! FIZ and BIZ give up LE(Z). Decide on ZO(O)N to block bingo lines in case he finds something, and to set up my S.
>Mike_Fleck: ?EFLNOR D7 OF +20 350
>Winter: BFIRRSY D11 FIRRY +39 380
#note Not 100% sure, but this is a POWERFUL play and leaves me the S hook.
