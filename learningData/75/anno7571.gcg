#note thought that the vowels after VIM were crippling but the defensive value is well worth it

#note might have overestimated the badness of the Ds but sims even with JO

#note nooo I totally looked for a bingo too and still missed DIALYTIC

#note I have a devastating YUNX# but failing that LYNX or TUX both look better than my play

>Magra: ADFORRT A11 DRAFT +33 224
#note strangely enough it seems the priority is keeping a bigger leave...with tons of great tiles out including all the Es FARO sims way better, not for defensive reasons but because the bingo percentage jumps significantly

>Magra: AEEHLOR M12 HOE +23 247
#note quackle suggests throwing caution to the wind and playing HAOLE. sure, I guess the board is already pretty open. maybe opening the triple won't be so terrible.

>Magra: AEELPRZ J3 PR.Z +65 312
#note I would definitely end up regretting playing off my consonants

#note uhoh
>Magra: AEELOOT 14A .OAL +20 332
#note I took forever on this move trying to find an alternative that wasn't terrible. quackle has an insane suggestion...exchange 7! it sims best by just a little bit over FOE. I don't know why I made my play. somehow I had the idea that I needed more turnover and that AELOT wasn't good enough of a leave. in any case there is absolutely nothing I can do about the huge lane on column O.

>Magra: EEEIOOT 1H .O +4 336
#note I apparently win more if I empty the bag. I'm screwed if he has the good tiles anyway. so the only real shot is to hope...I was almost totally out of time. I had two seconds after this play.

#note the blank was in the bag!
>Magra: EEEEIOT C7 O.E +13 349
>Magra: EEEEIOT --  -13 336
#note with ideal play I should lose, but the way he did it it actually should've been a tie! unfortunately, I transpose the letters stupidly.
