>Brad_Whitmarsh: ABLLU H4 BULLA +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEILNQ 5G Q.ALIA +30 30
#note Thought about QUINELA to avoid dangling the vowel under the DWS. This sims a little better, though, so I guess the balanced leave is more important.

>Evans_Clinchy: EINORRT 1H ORIENT +28 87
#note Fishing definitely isn't worth it, especially with all the power tiles still in the bag. Dig dig dig.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DELNNOS 2B DONNELS +72 184
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DELNNOS --  -72 112
>Evans_Clinchy: AGMRSTU 6L GUM +25 112
#note I really liked setting up this S hook, since he didn't have anything that good to do there. SONDE is probably his best option if he decides to block the line.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DELNNOS 8J DONNES +31 143
#note Another phony! DONNE is the plural of DONNA, no S.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGIRST O8 .EAGIRTS +80 192
#note Phony No. 3! Yikes.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: FILO 6F FI.LO +35 178
>Evans_Clinchy: AEHIJXY 11K HAJ +38 230
#note Multiple setups worth considering here -- JAY 2F, which sets up OX for 43 if I draw an O, and OXEYE K8, which sets up HAJI for 40. Both sim about 3-4 points ahead of HAJ.

>Brad_Whitmarsh: INT 4D NIT +25 304
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AGMOSY 2B GOY +25 319
#note GOYIM 13I sims better, not sure why. I felt fine about this.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: KOP 14G KOP +18 322
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABCMST H13 T.. +6 325
#note There are a lot of possible sevens here in line 12. If I draw the A, TAMBACS. If I draw the P, MOBCAPS. If I draw the U, CUMBIAS. If I draw the W, WEBCAMS. If I draw an E, R or T, then a lot of stuff. The N and the V are the only two tiles I really don't want to see.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AT I12 TA.. +10 332
#note So I don't get a bingo, but I've forced him to give up equity to block. I'll take it.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABCMRS 10N M. +10 335
#note An unnecessarily fishy play, since I could be in trouble if I don't draw the E I'm looking for. But I couldn't find much better.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EVW 13K W.VE. +22 354
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABCERS 12B ACeRBES. +82 417
#note Lucky me. (I saw CABRESTA 8A but played it safe since there was a slight chance I was confusing it with CABESTRA*. A win's a win.)
