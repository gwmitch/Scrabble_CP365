>Dave: DDLNOOR 8D DROOL +16 16
>KC: ILOTU D3 TOLUI. +14 14
>Dave: ADEMNPY E4 YAM +29 45
#note Leave-wise, YAP may be a touch better, but this makes up for it by setting up the P at F6.
>KC: BOTU C1 BOUT +22 36
>Dave: DEELNPV 7G DEVEL +22 67
#note VEEP 9C is the star play.  I think DEVEL makes more sense than DEV, given that I don't have an A and the remaining letters are unlikely to be able to do much with the B on row 1.
>KC: DDOS L4 ODDS +22 58
>Dave: ?GHIINP K3 PHI +27 94
>KC: FO 1A FO. +24 82
>Dave: ?AGIINW 6J WA.I +39 133
>KC: IKNSW N2 WINKS +39 121
>Dave: ?AEGINT 1H EATINGs +86 219
#note The most topical bingo to play at XKCP.
>KC: EEJP 9C JEEP +35 156
>Dave: EGRTTVZ 3M Z.G +26 245
>KC: LUX A1 .LUX +22 178
#note Creates the fun FLUXIONS and FLUXGATE extensions, though they never happened in the game.  FLUXIONAL is good too, I just learned.
>Dave: ENRTTUV 2F VENT +19 264
>KC: AR C9 .AR +10 188
>Dave: CFRRTUY 10F TURFY +28 292
>KC: AO O3 .OA +14 202
>Dave: CINNQRR -CINNQR +0 292
#note I could play the Q for 21 here, but considering that her last two plays suggest she is close to bingoing, it made more sense to me to dump all this junk immediately, and to give her the chance to draw the Q.
>KC: AEEIRST 12C SERIATE +77 279
>Dave: BEEENOR 13G BORNE +23 315
#note Uh oh, she bingoed without the blank, and it's still out there.  I figure the best thing to do was turn over as many tiles as possible and block what I could.
>KC: ACCGIM 12K MAGI +18 297
#note What a play by KC!  She had both C's and did not have the blank yet.
>Dave: AEEHNQR 11L NAH +16 331
#note What to do?  QI N11 isn't likely to block her bingos, and probably just makes her plays there score more.
>KC: ?ACCEIN O12 CECA +46 343
#note She missed her bingo CHICANE here, but this is also good enough to win.
>Dave: EEIQRS 14E QIS +19 350
>KC: ?IN 15D zIN +15 358
>KC:  (EER) +6 364
#note Awesome comeback by KC.
