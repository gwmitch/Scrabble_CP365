>N_Peltier: AEFQTUV 8D QUATE +48 48
#note Unquestionably right.
>Verbie: AEELORS C3 AREOLES +83 83
#note Seems like a normal start, if a bit high-scoring.
>N_Peltier: DEFPUVY 4A FU.Y +28 76
#note Right spot, but PURVEY scores 6 more and sheds the V.  (-9.5)
>Verbie: ?ADHMSY 8A AD...... +54 137
#note What's funny here is not that this is top, but 2d is ADEQUATElY for 66.  There was a bingo, SHAMoYED H2, but that's 22 back.  It'll take some time to turn these consonants into something...
>N_Peltier: BDEPRVV F6 BR.VED +20 96
#note Again the right place, but VARVED F7 scores 1 more and drops both V's.  (-5)
>Verbie: ?HMRSTY 7H RHYThMS +73 210
#note Who said you need vowels?!?  We're both on notice that something special is afoot.
>N_Peltier: AEIOPTV 11E A.OPTIVE +106 202
#note Nigel's not one to get left out of this awesomeness.  Also available was OPTATIVE K5 102.
>Verbie: ?EKMRUX 10I EX +52 262
#note Um... sure.
>N_Peltier: EEIIOOT -EIIOO +0 202
#note Incredibly not top, but close:  OTIOSE N3 just a hair better.  (-.5)
>Verbie: ?IJKMRU 12L MURK +38 300
#note Finally I screw one up:  N2 MUJIKS 58!  (-30)
>N_Peltier: ADELNTT A1 DEL.T +27 229
#note DAUNTED or TAUNTED would be insanely cool... at B2! (play made is -2 to DAUNTED, or even with TAUNTED)
>Verbie: ?ABGIJU 6B J.B +28 328
#note Clanked one.  BIJUGATe K1 and plenty of better-leave options besides. (-37)  I also considered JAUKINg O9, which was about a 5-point improvement on what I actually did...
>N_Peltier: AEHLNNT O12 .HAN +33 262
#note The T isn't worth the sacrifice to keep.  THANK O8.  (-1.5)  Although NP needs the openings now.
>Verbie: ?AGIORU 13F GIAOURs +63 391
#note Funny, I saw AROUSInG N3 and should have seen it scored 1 more.  I probably should have seen GOURAMIs M2 for +7, but I likely would not have seen RIGAUdON 15H... (-14)
>N_Peltier: EILLNTW H11 .L.IN +24 286
#note AWL here kills off the W and is worth the points sacrifice.  (-7.5)
>Verbie: AEIINOP 6J OI +13 404
#note No way is EPINAOS N1 the right play at this score, so I'm not counting this as -2.7.  ROPE/ REPO N12 I can see though.  (-.7 to these)
>N_Peltier: CEFLOTW 5J FLOW +35 321
#note First top play for either of us in 8 plays.
>Verbie: AEIINPR N2 PAIN +23 427
#note Again, I'm not counting Q's top choice for reason of tws exposure (RAPINES N1), QI D8 doesn't shorten the game, I'll accept PI N14 here.  (still -3)
>N_Peltier: ACEENOT N10 CE.ATE +39 360
#note In the absence of a spot for ACETONE, this is the best available.
>Verbie: CEEEIRW O1 WEE +24 451
#note the top here is much cooler:  VIEW 9F 31.  (-5)
>N_Peltier: AINNOOZ M3 NO. +20 380
#note Better to cash the Z here with ZOON, ZONA, or AZON 12 B.  (-7.5 to ZOON, -5 to the others)
>Verbie: CDEGIOR 15B RECODI.G +65 516
#note OK, I dare you, Nigel.  Whaddaya got?
>N_Peltier: AIINNOZ 12B AZON +28 408
#note MISSED IT... and IT would have won!  Answer coming up...
>Verbie: GISST 9F .IGS +21 537
>N_Peltier: IIN C12 .IN. +26 434
#note the missed bingo was DIAZINON 1A 134, out, winning!
>Verbie: ST 13B T.S +7 544
#note STY D2 is 1 better
>Verbie:  (I) +2 546
