>Richard_Buck: CDO 8G DOC +12 12
>Winter: GIIJTUU 7F JIG +19 19
#note ,I hate to exchange, give up the points, and have Richard zing me with the Q later.
>Richard_Buck: ADEIORS J2 ROADIES +69 81
#note Awesome.
>Winter: AIILTUU 5F TULA.I +14 33
#note Now I'm definitely glad I took points. Doubt I would have drawn into a bingo off a 7 tiles exchange, and now at least I'm not as far down.
>Richard_Buck: DEINX 4C INDEX +37 118
#note @#$%!!!
>Winter: EILPRUY 3A YUP +24 57
#note GODDAMN IT!!! I SAW THE WORD, BUT IT JUST SEEMED RIDICULOUSLY IMPLAUSIBLE.
>Richard_Buck: AIOT 2J .ATIO +10 128
>Winter: EILRTVY M2 .VY +18 75
#note Hmm... I leaned away from IV(Y) b/c I wanted to bingo quickly and get a better chance at blanks and esses. I think the Y really hurts my bingo chances.
>Richard_Buck: EF A1 FE. +27 155

>Richard_Buck: AEIOP A6 OPO.EA +30 185

>Richard_Buck: AEGIL 5A ILEA +11 199
>Winter: ADEGNSZ 12A GAZES +45 233
#note Pulled GAZES back b/c of the counterplay, but finally decided that the turnover, with both blanks unseen, was worth it.
>Richard_Buck: ANW 13B WAN +41 240
>Winter: DIMNNOQ 6I M.ND +21 254
#note Not sure why Q disvalues M(I)ND so much, but certainly turnover might have helped me get the blank sooner and maybe play the Q before the board got too tight. Not that it was friendly.
>Richard_Buck: OTU H1 OUT +15 255
#note This really hurt, for my Q(A)T play.
>Winter: GILNOQT O1 INGOT +27 281
#note Maybe I should have exchanged at this point, but the 27 points and taking that spot seemed better. I should have been more wary of the Q.
>Richard_Buck: ERV 6C REV +15 270
#note Couldn't justify keeping the Q anymore--way too dangerous on this board. Not sure why Q favors ditching the A tho.
>Winter: ACHLNQS -HLQN +0 281
>Richard_Buck: EI F9 .EI +15 285
>Winter: ?AACEES 14A AAS +30 311
#note Dammit--saw CASEAtE but missed the good bingo. Although maybe I don't play it even if I see it, b/c of the Q.
>Richard_Buck: B 4L B. +14 299
>Winter: ?CEEOQU 1A .iQUE +17 328
#note MISSING QUO(D).  WITH THE BLANK I PROBABLY WIN!!!
>Richard_Buck: ?AENORT M6 sENATOR +65 364
#note Wow, if I had kept that blank I could have won!!!
