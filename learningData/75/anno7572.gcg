#note WEKA might be better than bingoing, says quackle. I guess it does leave S?
>Tom: DELRTTU 15G TURTL. +18 149
#note tom and mike were laughing at the prospect of playing TURTLED but didn't realize it was a word! I guess it does look kinda silly.
>Magra: AAOOPRT C12 POO +22 194
#note no wonderful options here
>Tom: ?DEGOOT M3 sTOOGED +84 233
#note awesome play! tom had two 93 point bingos the game before including BEDPANS with 3 overlaps. oh, and he also knows everything about everything. try him some time.

>Magra: AAIMNOT 14A AN..MIA +24 280
#note AAIMNT is quite a powerful leave that I really shouldn't have broken up, especially down this much and with an S right there to play to that's hard to block.

#note WEET at F2 is not the worst idea ever although his last play seems to argue he might have the S...
>Tom: IZ 3B ZI. +24 389
>Magra: ACERSTW K2 ARCS +31 391
#note I have the win guaranteed and I totally blew it! I saw RECS here but didn't realize it set up for TAW for more points and the 1 point win. really though all I had to do was play a different play here, or the best play ARC at E1.
