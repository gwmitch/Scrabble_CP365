#note TROD sims a bit better in the end. Four consos on a tight board will fail too often. I just hated keeping the G and opening the TWS.
>Keller: AFLOST K3 FLOTAS +30 52
>Tunnicliffe: DELOQRT 3H TEL.ORD +24 43
#note Intended to give me a shot at QA(T) next turn. The sim prefers 10E DOTER however. I am guessing this is because Jason plays through the T in most scenarios, neutralizing the QAT advantage. I guess the plan with DOTER is to pick an I and play QI at J2.

#note Looks needlessly risky compared to the equal score of 4D FUZEE. But I figured the FIZ setup was worth it. I need to milk points out of these clunky leaves. Also, there's only one S left, so the risk felt marginal.

#note I knew it was time to start thinking bingo, but shutting down these promising lanes was a tough call. Nothing else makes much sense, though.
>Keller: ACPR 4D CRAP. +18 260
>Tunnicliffe: ?AELMRU 14C sERUMAL +68 322
#note It can also hook to CRAPE. I dunno. I was probably too worried about big plays through the M like WIMP or KEMPT, when really I need to not give an S and E to bingo through. C4 SERUMAL isn't exactly bingo-safe either, leaving the board wide open for sevens. There's also a case to be made for not bingoing here (not a great case, in my opinion). 14C sERUMAL wins the sim, whatever that's worth.
>Keller: EIRW 15A WEIR +28 288
>Tunnicliffe: ?HHIINP 11J HI. +21 343
#note I wanted to close down the C. I didn't see any possible bingoes through it at the time (there is one: COGITATE) and it's not easy to block without opening a new lane or a big spot for the K. Even if he hits that bingo, I can outrun by abusing the hook. Quackle says 13A HIP. O1 PIsH is interesting, too. But anything that isn't stupid is >99%.
