>Stefan_Rau: AVY F6 VA.Y +18 18
>Winter: ADHRUVW E7 H.ARD +28 68
#note Of course I hate the UVW leave, but I'd rather extend my lead than let Stef score there.
>Stefan_Rau: DEIKN D11 INKED +27 45
>Winter: ?ILUVWW 15A WIL. +24 92
#note Oh yeah, I gotta love leaving UVW... FOR THE SECOND TIME!!! Quack likes VI(E)W, but that gives up points and doesn't necessarily Stef from scoring off the D, and why do that for a LUW? leave???
>Stefan_Rau: AZ D6 ZA. +25 70
>Winter: ?BOTUVW H8 .WOB +9 101
#note FUCK!!! Of course I saw the O(VARY) hook when Stef played, but then I forgot it!
>Stefan_Rau: ADH 14B HA.D +28 98
>Winter: ?EOTUVY 11H .EVY +24 125
#note Finally a good leave.
>Stefan_Rau: BIIOR 12K ORIBI +21 119
>Winter: ?EORTUU O8 UTER. +15 140
#note So much for a good leave. The bingo is still a bit deep for me. And I'm still missing the VARY hook!!! At this point nobody things I deserved to win this game, let alone the tournament.
>Stefan_Rau: ELNO N10 NO.LE +24 143
>Winter: ?AEOPTU N2 AUTOPEn +79 219
#note There we go--a rack I can deal with!
>Stefan_Rau: EEGIN O1 GENIE +30 173
>Winter: DGLNNSS 14L GL.N +5 224
#note On this board, making it hard for Stefan to bingo seems right. Still missing that @#^&$ VARY hook though.
>Stefan_Rau: AAA -AAA +0 173
#note Caught a breather here.
>Winter: DFNRSST I10 F.NDS +16 240
#note His exchange was just what I needed to further muck up this line and try to draw vowels.
>Stefan_Rau: ILM C9 MIL +12 185
#note Here we go--now I have to worry about this line
>Winter: IIMRSST 13C S.IM +29 269
#note Cake.
>Stefan_Rau: AIP G13 PIA +24 209
#note Getting really lucky that Stefan hasn't bingoed.
>Winter: ACIRSTT H14 TI +15 284
#note Thought about blocking the line he opened, but what if he gets FA or ETA. I'd rather take the points, keep the good leave, and counterplay if he bingos along the B column (still missing the VARY hook).
>Stefan_Rau: ?AENORU 5F OUtEARN +73 282
#note Was totally surprised that I had missed the hook, but still caught a huge break that he missed the double-double.
>Winter: ACGORST 4D ROC +24 308
#note Bingo way too deep for me. I play to keep the AT in case I draw the Q.
>Stefan_Rau: CEEJ H1 EJEC. +48 330
#note Oh shit, now I'm in trouble!!!	
>Winter: AEGOOST 15K GOOSE +41 349
#note UNBELIEVABLY LUCKY HERE!!
>Stefan_Rau: AFQTT 3C QAT +28 358
>Winter: AT 2F TA. +12 361
#note Damn, saw (EJECT)A after I played.
