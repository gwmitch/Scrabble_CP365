#note She blocked BAUHINIA, but this was a nice backup play.
>Jan: CDEIOPU 15G U.COPIED +64 331
>Jan: CDEIOPU --  -64 267
#note I allowed this phony against Mark McCraw in a game that cost me the 2007 summer Albany tournament.  (I missed RECOPIES in that same game.)  Needless to say, there was no way I was letting it stay again.
>Dave: ?IKNUU B11 KU.U +14 311
#note I forgot to write my rack down on this play, so I don't know one tile.  I think it was either E or S.
>Jan: CDEIOPU L3 PO.D +37 304
>Dave: ?EIJNOS 6F JO. +26 337
#note Now I'm confused, because it appears I missed JONESING, but I am absolutely sure that I thought of that word during this game.  My best guess is that I misread the board and thought that the J was running into BLOTTIER.  That's a very bad error, considering that the game is very close and she still has bingo chances.
>Jan: CEEIN K9 NIECE +18 322
#note Blocks TOXINES, but I'm still in good shape to win as long as I don't get sloppy by allowing ANEURINS or giving her a spot for another bingo.
>Dave: ?EINOSX 14K SEXtO +30 367
>Jan: AHINRSU -  +0 322
#note Jan couldn't remember the word for sure, and reasoned that she was losing anyway if it stayed.  So she challenged, which made the final score look more lopsided than the game really was.
>Dave: EIN M12 NI.E +22 389
#note Oops, I had an outplay for one more point.
>Dave:  (AHINRSU) +20 409
