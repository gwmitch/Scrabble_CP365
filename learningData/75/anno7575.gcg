#note Umm, no. Opening short with JUN or even JEU is way better.

#note Quackle is taunting me by telling me to play JOULE. It's an interesting idea -- there's significant defensive value to not bingoing, and JOULE leaves me with a couple ways to bingo for more point next turn. If I draw one-point tiles, I can find a double-double in line 11, or if I pick up one or two heavier ones, I can find a DLS/TWS combo in a line H bingo. Settling for 71 points now is... meh. Sims says I'll average 88 next turn, bingoing 94 percent of the time.

>Evans_Clinchy: AABHIRU F2 URBIA +17 128
#note BEAU 10D sims best. Clever play to set up a lane for the H.
>Winter: AEGMRSV 10D G.M +23 108
>Evans_Clinchy: AAFHILW 3C WHI. +20 148
#note This and NAW 2H sim pretty close. 
>Winter: AAEORSV 4B VOE +27 135
>Evans_Clinchy: AADFLRT 2A FAT +18 166
#note Quackle suggests DAFT 11E as another possibility. I'm gonna wait on opening this board.
>Winter: AADRRSW 2H .AW +14 149
>Evans_Clinchy: AADLRRS J2 .ARD +8 174
#note Only six tiles left to front-hook WARD, and I've got two of them. I'll give it a shot.
>Winter: ADERRSV 3H .R.VED +23 172
>Evans_Clinchy: AHILMRS L2 H.M +16 190
#note I thought this was kinda clever since there were only two A's in the pool, so I'm likely to cash in with AHEM. But, uh, THEM is also a word. And plus I missed HIEMAL for 30.

#note I was trying to do something super-volatile to give myself a chance to come back. Stupid. Just play TUFT 1L.

>Evans_Clinchy: DEISTTU 5J .UES +34 357
#note Best, threatening DITTY 15D and forcing him to block.
>Winter: EEEGOOP 15D POGE. +14 368
#note REALLY, WINTER?!
>Evans_Clinchy: DITT 7H .DIT +7 364
#note Best -- just had to find any possible way to play off DIT or TIT, keeping a D or T for the unblockable 2N spot. This is the one.
