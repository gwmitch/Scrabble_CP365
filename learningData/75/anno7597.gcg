#note 5E FLa(N)KEN... nah.  KNE(W) is right if not ELF.  Me = happy.
>David_Gibson: DNRUW 4D UNDR.W +20 58
#note Such a weird word.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABDEFL E2 Fi.DABLE +76 160
#note FUNDABLE is no good.  Wow.  He said he thought it was.  FLATBEDS is the only other bingo.

#note A(V)O is best.  I thought it was pretty bad.  Crazy world.  Of note, 5H (N)OUS 13, 5A SOU 13.
>David_Gibson: AJRU 8A JURA. +39 250

#note Whee~!
>David_Gibson: AEHPRST L7 SHARPE.T +84 346
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIITZ K4 ZITI +28 372
#note Le'dammit!  Well, I figured there's no way I'd win with two Is unseen, three still on my rack.  Luckily, though, I noted I have the case A.  So I'm pretty happy with ZITI.  An awesome play.
>David_Gibson: EFITY N10 FEI.TY +40 386
#note Two FY plays for 40+, he remarked after the game.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIINR L1 INIA +32 404
#note Aw, he didn't give me INERTIAE.  So.  I see GENTLED in the pool.  That's the only way I can lose, but it's such a low shot I figure I've gotta take the score I set up for myself.  INIA it is.  Champ says AE wins 63%, which I did consider.  (L)IE wins 58%, I guess because it blocks that X spot?  Not that it's much of a threat.  This is so complex, and what happens next is like a magician working his craft, the true meaning of Gibsonization.  :(  INIA doesn't come up for Champ.  I don't understand why.  Help?  AERIE O6 sims okay, as does (H)EIR.
>David_Gibson: DEGLNTX O8 GLED +26 412
#note There are 5 plays that win 100%, he found one of course.  So crazy that vowels actually hurt me here.  I don't know which play could have foreseen that.  Near perfect play until the endgame and it still isn't enough.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEERT 15M T.E +18 422
#note Wow, 12K E(E)R(I)E 18 is nice.  It's of little consolation that T(Y)E is Champ's top choice.  Nothing I could do about this one.
>David_Gibson: NTX D14 .X +34 446
>Ryan_Fischer: EER B4 ERE +10 432
#note If I find EERIE it loses by 2.  Oh well.
