>CeLe: EEJSS 8D JESSE +40 40
#note I would have played DAY I8, if I could.
>Dave: AAGIKNN E5 KAN. +16 16
>CeLe: DGINZ 6D D.ZING +37 77
#note She blocked GUARANIS.
>Dave: AAGINRU D8 .AGUAR +28 44
>CeLe: QU F8 .UQ +32 109
#note She blocked GALIVANT.
>Dave: AAILNTV 9B AV. +10 54
#note Given how blocked the board was becoming, it seemed like a worthwhile gamble to try this.
>CeLe: ILMO A6 MOIL +25 134
>Dave: ADILNTT 12A DIL.TANT +62 116
>CeLe: EIMPT -  +0 134
#note Lost challenge.
>Dave: AABRTVY A12 .AVY +33 149
#note No way to make a five tile play slotting the Y at B6 unfortunately.  It's hard to use up the Y while that spot is open, but I couldn't find any play I liked as much as this one.
>CeLe: EIMPT H1 PITME. +39 173
>Dave: ABORSTW 14A .OWS +35 184
#note Kibitzer likes BOW B5, but the S isn't worth that much on this board.  Take the points.
>CeLe: CDEHI B2 CHIDE +32 205
>Dave: ABINORT 9H TABORIN +63 247
>CeLe: CEELX O6 EXCEL +52 257
>Dave: ?HNORTT N2 NORTH +45 292
#note Taking this spot with NORTH or TROTH is better than bingoing.  I chose NORTH because there is one N remaining and I hold the case T.  Not exposing O4 to a vowel is good too.
>CeLe: AFY O1 FAY +34 291
>Dave: ?EGNOPT K5 GEOP.NTs +90 382
>Dave: ?EGNOPT --  -90 292
#note This is where I burned a ton of time and got myself into a mad time scramble for the rest of the game.  The problem is both that my bingo is hard to find, and that there's a good chance that she has good letters and may hit the bingo spot first.  I thought this attempt was questionable, but it looked vaguely familiar, and I thought I might be able to push her around after winning a turn earlier in the game.  GEOPONIC was the reason for my confusion.
>CeLe: BDEIORS L3 BROIDE.S +74 365
#note BORIDES on row 11 is her best bingo.
>Dave: ?EGNOPT 2B .OEmPT.NG +73 365
#note After burning more time on the clock, I finally found my bingo, but now I was down to a few seconds.
>CeLe: OW C1 W.O +22 387
>Dave: EEERR 10I REE. +16 381
#note In addition to these tiles I had two of LU?.  I think it was L?, but I forgot to write it down.  I was hoping to play HERE 3B, but she smartly took the spot away.
>CeLe: AEFIIOU H12 .OFU +21 408
#note Scored as 18.
>Dave: ?ELRU 14H .ERULe +10 391
#note Went overtime by a second or two as I made this play.  If I had found NEURaL without going overtime and we had corrected her previous score, she still would have won by one.  With my clock situation, slow playing it wasn't an option, but it turns out RILE 4A gets beaten by INIA I1 anyway.
