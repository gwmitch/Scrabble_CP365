#note fortunately I realized that this is a pretty poweful leave.

>Magra: CEINOPS G7 P.. +11 115
#note YEP is way better. I really could've used the extra lanes to make sure he can't block my fish.
>XP_Morgan: GORSTVX 5E GOR +16 154
#note XP: cheap X setup, since I wasnt what else to do 
>Magra: CEIINOS H1 ICONES +32 147
#note the board didn't seem very bingo friendly and I didn't want to be stuck fishing as he shut my options down. fishing sims equal but probably does worse in actuality. COSIE would be better than this play.
>XP_Morgan: ASTTUVX 6D TAX +56 210
#note XP: amazingly that worked
>Magra: AIMNOTU 2G A.ONITUM +78 225
#note well, that was lucky
>XP_Morgan: AELSTUV M2 .VULA +16 226
#note per quackle xp has yet to make a mistake so far this game
>Magra: ?BDEIOU L6 BEDOUIn +76 301
#note well that was lucky
>XP_Morgan: AENQSTY K11 QAT +47 273
#note dumping the Y with QUAY might be better, although they sim kinda close with each other
>Magra: ACGORSU 14E COUGARS +77 378
#note well that was lucky
>XP_Morgan: AEENSTY N4 NAY +34 307
#note I woulI wouldn't necessarily have picked NAY over AY and yet once again it jumps out in front on the sim. nice call xp
>Magra: EEEIIKO 8L .EKE +27 405
#note what no bingo? totally didn't think of DIKE for some odd reason, which would swiftly prove costly
>XP_Morgan: EELNRST C8 ..LTER +16 323
#note XP: what's the best play here?

JD: I think he has to drop an L and fish. He probably needs to keep as many tiles in the bag as possible so he has time to forge some sort of comeback. that said BELTER doesn't do too badly in a sim.
>Magra: EIIMNOR 15G NOME +35 440
#note blocking a big Z play and trying to leap ahead on points. But the N goes with the I much better so MORE is better. 
>XP_Morgan: EEFHNOS 13G FEH +43 366
>Magra: IIIIPRR N8 .IR +9 449
#note it would be hard to imagine a worse draw, although I guess I could've avoided it by playing DIKE earlier. I'm really surprised by quackle's suggestions. I wanted to block the biggest bingos on column O like ENHALOED or ETHANOLS or ENDOSTEA after which I might be legitimately screwed, as opposed to the various seventy point bingos he might end up with at column J, row 1 or row 11. Indeed, KIR drops his bingo percentage from 5 to 1%, and also keeps a more flexible leave than KIP (PERI works the same way). the more I look at it the more sure I am that that has to be the right idea.
>XP_Morgan: AELNOST 6H .O +2 368
#note great idea by chris. quackle says it wins him some games. I'm not sure if that's true but there is definitely the possibility for me to get stuck with the Z and get bingoed out on if I play it wrong.
>Magra: FIIIPRZ 12A PR.Z +36 485
#note works, but not playing on column J absolutely kills my spread. in fact all I have to do is play ZIP at J4 which is really not a hard find. I guess my lowness on time meant that I was content with the sure win.
