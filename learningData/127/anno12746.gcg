>John: AFNWY 8D FAWNY +36 36
>Matt: BCDDEGR E7 B.RGED +20 20
#note Yeah BADGED or CADGED.  
>John: EOZ 9C ZE.O +33 69
>Matt: CDEHILV C9 .ILCH +38 58
#note This seemed obvious to me, but HIVED is actually one more point, and DEVIL keeps CH while scoring 29.
>John: EH B10 HE +28 97
>Matt: ADEGORV A11 GROVE +34 92
#note Didn't think about playing short with VAG# A8.  
>John: AE D11 EA +22 119
#note Cute fit.
>Matt: AADELNX 7H ADNEXAL +73 165
#note Held for a minute or so, then released.  Funny since he played DANELAW# against me in about the same spot last year in Charlotte.
>John: AMPRT K3 TAMP.R +20 139
>Matt: EIILNSW L2 WILI +24 189
#note GWINE is 34.  IWI is 4 more in this spot, but I didn't like the LN combo, even with an S in tow.  There are lots of I's unseen at this point, so ditching both seemed prudent.  
>John: AQT 6F QAT +38 177
>Matt: EJNRSTU 4H JUR.. +20 209
#note JUS for 9 more points perhaps, something I didn't consider.
>John: GOV 8M GOV +26 203
>Matt: BEEENST H1 BEN. +39 248
#note I can't quite shake him yet, and I'm soon about to drown in one point tiles that don't bingo.
>John: OO 10E .OO +14 217
>Matt: AEEESTT M1 TEE +17 265
#note He's probably close to a bingo, and I can't block that bingo lane effectively.  Might as well try to balance and hit something next turn.
>John: ?ADMSTU 11G MUSTArD +72 289
#note SUMmATED and MUScADET are 74, but this is the easiest lane to hit so it has to go.  
>Matt: AAEENST 1M .AE +9 274
#note This took away the triple, balanced the rack, but these last two draws mean I have to bingo next turn
>John: FIKNRU 2C FUNKI.R +24 313
#note And just as my rack gets together he takes my spot.
>Matt: AENNSST N1 .NS +22 296
#note Well let's try fishing to ANTES again.  My prospects don't look good though.
>John: ?DEIIOS O8 .ISIOnED +86 399
#note Noooooooo......
>Matt: ACENPST H10 P.N +13 309
#note Sets up my A, S, and T, in a last ditch effort to save spread.
>John: OTY N12 TOY +25 424
#note He thought it more likely that I could bingo to the E or D than make a 7 tile fit along row 13.  
>Matt: ACEORST 13F COASTER +67 376
#note Scored as 66.  Too little, too late.  A couple of slightly questionable plays, but I don't feel like I lost the game here with bad play, just unlucky, and John played his side very well.
