#note i actually didn't even consider QuODS. it scores so much with a good leave that it has to be the right play. i was 4-1 and feeling good here. little did i know what would happen. 10E NOD is also interesting. (-11.5)

#note G11 RIP seems like a good play, PURIN is ok, 13H LINEUP, M7 PAULIN and 4B PURLINE. so many choices. i like RIP in retrospect, it scores and blocks a scoring line. although PURLINE might work if i'm lucky enough. (-5)
