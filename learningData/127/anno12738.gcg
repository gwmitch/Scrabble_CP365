>Ross_Brown: AGIKOOU H5 GOOK +18 18
#note Ross: Best (or KAGU).
>Chris_Cree: ABCIPQR I7 PAC +26 26
>Ross_Brown: ABEHISU 10H HABU +23 41
#note Ross: I miss BEAUISH (not a word I know) for 80.
>Chris_Cree: BIMQRSY K8 SQ.IB +32 58
>Ross_Brown: DEEINNS 11C INDENES +80 121
#note Ross: Best. Held.

#note Ross: Best.
>Chris_Cree: ?AEMRSV M7 V.RSEMAn +84 171
>Ross_Brown: ACDILUX 12G AX +40 200
#note Ross: Though I think I've checked all the possibilities on column L, somehow I miss seeing CALIX for 66.
>Chris_Cree: ?AENOPU O8 .UPNOEAs +80 251
>Ross_Brown: CDEILUW 5E CUD.EL +20 220
#note Ross: Not sure why I think this is better than just W(AX); possibly being defensive.
>Chris_Cree: AGIIIOS D11 .AOI +8 259
>Ross_Brown: EINOTVW 13C V.W +18 238
#note Ross: I talk myself out of (HEX)ONE (only being certain of HEXANE). V(O)W is not too shabby.
>Chris_Cree: AGHIIST L12 AHI +32 291
>Ross_Brown: EINOTTY G7 TOY +24 262
#note Ross: ENTITY is marginally better, but I like this leave.
>Chris_Cree: GIRRSTT 15H GRITS +29 320
>Ross_Brown: AEEINRT 4I RETINAE +70 332
#note Ross: Best.
>Chris_Cree: EEFIRRT 3C FERRITE +78 398
>Ross_Brown: DLLOTTZ O1 DOZ. +42 374
#note Ross: Intriguingly, Quackle prefers L(E)Z for 24 and says that DOZ(E) gives no chance of winning, but I know there's a U out there that will let me cash in on this Z again.

>Ross_Brown: JLLMTTU 3L LUT. +34 408
#note Ross: Best.
>Chris_Cree: EFGINOR C3 .OREIGN +13 421
#note Ross: Chris holds FOREIGN and doesn't see O(F)FERING for the win; time trouble. In setting up (O)F/(E)F and F(E) and blocking the better of my two JAM plays, he thinks he has sewed up the win, but in haste, he fails to see that he has created an even better JAM spot that blocks both of those out-plays.
