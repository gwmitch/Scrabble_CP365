>carl: BILO 8F BOIL +12 12
>moh: AACLPRV E7 LARVA +23 23
#note Or ARVAL. I could improve a little by playing LARVA from E4 instead, since then I wouldn't be offering you as many opportunities to hook LARVAE, LARVAL, etc.
>carl: Q H7 Q. +11 23
>moh: CNPSSSX -CNPSS +0 23
#note It's better for me to play something like 11C SC(A)NS or SP(A)NS for 7 points. Not sure why I didn't do that. I'm keeping essentially the same thing on an exchange, so why not score a few points? Among the exchanges, keeping CS, SS, SX, CSS, NSS, NS, and CNS are all in  a statistical dead heat.
>carl: AEW D11 AWE +14 37
#note If you're going to play AWE, I prefer hooing LARVAE with it. 9E (R)AW 23 also an option.
>moh: ADIMPSX 9E .AX +39 62
#note 14A SPADIX 72! I forgot that word even existed. My play is next best.
>carl: DFY 13C D.FY +22 59
>moh: DFIMOPS 12F MOP +17 79
#note I6 FI(L)M 25 is a strong play. I didn't really want to open up the A15 hot spot with a play like 14B POD.
>carl: EMO H12 .OEM +24 83
>moh: DEFIOSY I11 FEY +30 109
#note The star play here is I11 DEIFY 36. FEY is the second-best play.
>carl: IO I6 OI. +16 99
>moh: DEIOSSV J3 VOIDS +32 141
#note My VOIDS is best. VIDS in the same spot is also reasonable, but ES is a much stronger leave than EOS.
>carl: DLOR 4H DR.OL +16 115
>moh: EENRRSU M2 ENSURER +73 214
#note The only bingo.
>carl: IOSZ 8K ZO.IS +45 160
>moh: DEIIPUW H1 PIE. +21 235
#note I hate my play. The WU combo is on of the worst two-letter pairs in the game, so it's pretty terrible that I kept it when I could have avoided doing so with a play like 5E WIPE 21.
>carl: ?EGGLRT O1 ToGGLER. +83 243
#note Other bingo options were STRUGGLE and GURGLETS. They all score the same, so TOGGLERS is as good as anything else. 
>moh: ?IJKTUW 3E JUK. +20 255
#note 11I (F)UJI 28 is probably best. 15H (M)UJIK is fine, too. My JUKE sims just behind these plays.
>carl: BEIT K8 .IBET +32 275
>moh: ?HINOTW 13K HOW +38 293
#note 1A TOWNsHI(P) 98. I missed way too much this game. Ugh. My HOW is second-best.
>carl: AAR E2 A.AR +22 297
>moh: ?AINNTT 2B TIT.N +18 311
#note There is actually a bingo along the L column! N(O)TATI(O)Ns plays from L7 through the O's of ZORIS and HOW. 
>carl: AEGT 1A GATE +25 322
>moh: ?ADINNT 2J ANT. +18 329
#note Same story, different chapter: L7 D(O)NATI(O)NS 83!
>carl: CU 14F CU. +27 349
