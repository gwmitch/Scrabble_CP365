#note I dunno why I didn't play HIE 9I, and HIREE 9G looks cool too.
>Danny_Panganiban: VV -VV +0 28
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIRRST K6 RI.. +6 30
#note Ugh, this is kind of stupid, but there's too many hooks. Keeping the two ars probably isn't as bad as I thought. I didn't even know TRIMERS.
>Danny_Panganiban: ?AOQRTU 10D QUARTOs +72 100
#note He must not have known RIMER.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILRST N9 STERILE +77 107
#note I wasn't sure if taking the points made up for putting the E in a really bad place. Sim results say it's right.
>Danny_Panganiban: EFR 15L FR.E +33 133
>Matthew_Larocque: EGMOOOT 5K GOO +24 131
#note I wasted way too much time here. I was gonna play GEMOT for 32, but OO seemed like pretty lousy leave. Danny has challenged words in the past that I didn't expect him too, so I try to opt for more obscure words when I get the chance. This didn't seem like a good time for something silly like that.
>Danny_Panganiban: AOTU D10 .UOTA +28 161
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMORTV E8 OV.M +26 157
#note So yeah, I first see OVERT(A)ME and it sounds like too much of a stretch - plus I was sure I'd come accross it before and it wasn't any good. Then I see the wicked looking OVERM(U)TE, but that sounds even more stupid. I've been having terrible luck with phonies lately so I opt for the safe play since I'm not THAT far behind. Yet.
>Danny_Panganiban: ABDEOST 15A BOASTED +99 260
#note Yeesh.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIRTV 14J VEE +19 176
#note I didn't even look through that R.... damn, and I really needed it.

>Danny_Panganiban: AFN 14F FAN +30 324
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDJLST N2 CLAD +20 262
#note I'm starting to run my time down so I play this almost immediately, missing the huge J play of JA(I)L. I was hoping I'd luck into a huge JAYS play or something.... need some luck at this point.
>Danny_Panganiban: ACKLN D4 CLANK +44 368
#note Ouch, after he played this the game felt pretty much over.
>Matthew_Larocque: AJNRSTU 13B JU. +20 282
#note Well, I just missed JUNT(O) for 40, but I need to leave those letters open to keep any hope alive. And that Y hook... such a long shot, and I had no idea what it was about to lead to. 1% chance to win in the sim.
>Danny_Panganiban: ENW M3 EN.W +20 388
>Matthew_Larocque: AANRSTY C6 NA +8 290
#note I'm frantically looking at what letters are left, trying to come up with ANY bingo that I could possibly get ending in a Y. Then I just play this to open another spot. He'll block this before he blocks the CLAD spot.
>Danny_Panganiban: IOP G3 POI +19 407
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ARSTXY M12 .X +36 326
#note This X spot saved my ass. Suddenly I'm ~81% to win. I'm not so sure about that though. As long as Danny doesn't empty the bag, I don't THINK I can catch him. Plus it depends on what happens with the Z.
>Danny_Panganiban: DEGIINP B7 DING +14 421
#note I'm guessing this was his rack. He said BIZ was in the bag, but only two were in the bag. Maybe he got confused when he played this and forgot he had 2 Is at the time. Sim now says he had ~80% chance to win.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AIRSTY 1H vARSITY +91 417
#note This is pretty much the coolest finish to a game I've had in recent memory. Aside from it being a pretty big longshot, I got majorly lucky that Danny emptied the bag and drew BZ to swing the game 127 points in my favour. I've made bigger comebacks, but with less style than this.
