>Steve: ABEHM 8H BEMAH +32 32
#note Oh geez this is phony.  Just BEMA and BIMAH.  Didn't give it a second look.  Stupid alternate spellings.
>Matt: ALMNOPR 7I POLAR +29 29
#note Yeah, I had a hunch this might take an S, but it's 29 points and the leave isn't bad.  If I draw an A I have a nice pay at 6J.
>Steve: II -II +0 32
>Matt: DMNNORS 6H NOM +29 58
#note NOR(LA)NDS is a cool 2x2, and probably worth playing if I continue to just draw consonants every game.
>Steve: AEIIRST N2 AIRIEST +76 108
>Steve: ??AEEGN (challenge) +5 113
#note For 5 points and with how my rack is, I'm definitely challenging POLARS.  It's actually ours.  Sheesh.
>Matt: DLNRRSY -DLYR +0 58
#note At this point I was just ticked off that he had bingoed and I can't pounce on that corner he's opened at all.  I'm now trying to bingo ASAP.  (LA)RDY i sthe play I like in hindsight, but I probably just draw 3 more consonants. Was that kind of game.
>Steve: ??AEEGN 1H EvANGEl +81 194
#note Hah, 3 bingoes at 9G for 86.  He played this setting up the Y hook that I didn't know.  The game is pretty much over at this point, and I just push tiles from here on out.
>Matt: NORSUWX M3 XU +38 96
#note As you can see by the fact I ignored the same word for 52. 
>Steve: AACDEI O8 ACEDIA +36 230
>Matt: INORSUW N10 WO +29 125
#note And no B for UNIBROWS#. :(

>Steve: ADOT 9F TOAD +21 251
>Matt: EIINRSU F4 NEURI.IS +62 187
#note Or UNITISER#.  Probably that one to set up another S hook.
>Steve: ADDEJ M9 JADED +55 306
#note Whatever, I hate this game sometimes :).
>Matt: NOTTTUW L12 TOWT +23 210
#note Can't help but laugh at two UW draws in one game, coupled with a simultaneous 3 T draw.  And I thought keeping NTU would be better than TTU for 6 fewer points.
>Steve: CELRUV 15F CULVER. +36 342
>Matt: NNNTUYZ -NNUZY +0 210
#note It is really hard not to be bitter about how I drew this game, but it was karmic for not batting an eye at BEMAH* I guess.  I just want to bingo again.
>Steve: IQ E10 QI +37 379
>Matt: ELNRSTT 12C TEN +18 228
#note ST# comes back to haunt me again.  I save some face if I play it here for 29.
>Steve: AEGOR C8 GARO.E +16 395
>Matt: GLNRSTV 5E V.G +14 242
#note Yep, no vowels again.  To be fair, there's not a lot of vowels left.  
>Steve: FUZ J12 FUZ. +36 431
>Matt: KLNRSTY 4K KN..L +20 262
#note I need to get rid of another consonant, hence this over LURK.  
>Steve: EHI K10 HIE +19 450
>Matt: FIRSSTY 9B F.Y +9 271
#note Setting up another lane with 2 O's unseen, hopefully I draw one plus a letter like the P or E or B, or even the 2nd O.  
>Steve: BEILOPY O1 YE +47 497
>Steve: BILOP (challenge) +5 502
#note He cashes in his hook, but he actually had EPIBOLY right in the lane I just created for102.  Freaking A.  I challenged it because that's just ridiculous.  
>Matt: INORSST A5 INTROS +28 299
#note Bleh.
>Steve: BILOP B13 BOP +18 520
>Matt: S J6 ...S +14 313
#note Well I cracked 300 at least.  A taste of what was to come later, sadly.
>Matt:  (IL) +4 317
