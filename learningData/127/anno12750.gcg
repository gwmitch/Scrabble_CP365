>Matt: ADEEFRT 8D DRAFTEE +76 76
#note Sam had only lost 3 times since I defeated him in round 8, and was sitting in 1st place.  With a win here I would get to one back of him, and opening with a bingo certainly helps my chances here.
>Sam_K: FOPU 7F POUF +35 35
>Matt: BIINNSS K8 SNIB +24 100
#note An AX/OX word seemed more likely than a QA/QO word, plus this sets up my 2nd S, hence this over BINS.
>Sam_K: Q 10J Q. +31 66
#note Eh, could have been worse.
>Matt: BGINORS D5 BIR.SONG +74 174
#note I knew that one of BORINGS/ROBINGS# was good in TWL, but wasn't 100% on it.  Then I saw this play, which is 6 more.  Play was held briefly IIRC.  I am not giving him an S in a triple lane for 2 more points.
>Sam_K: EEJ E3 JEE +28 94
>Matt: AAEMRUU L11 AURUM +24 198
>Sam_K: ADERSTV 13D STARVED +76 170
#note ADVERTS up top is 2 more, but this worked out well for him considering my next rack.
>Matt: AEHIOPU 15H OPIU. +27 225
#note Blocked my EUPHORIA!  So I'll ditch my bad tiles for 27, at worst getting 25/28 for the H next turn.
>Sam_K: HOZ C3 ZHO +35 205
>Matt: AEEHLMV M9 VEHME +50 275
#note I was 100% on VEHM#, but not quite as sure on VEHME#.  I sucked it up because 50 points is a lot, and it locks down the right side of the board for now.  Turns out that VEHME# is actually the plural of VEHM#, no VEHMS*.  
>Sam_K: ?AEGIKN B5 lEAKING +70 275
#note I think it's right to take lEAKING over lINKAGE, making A15 much harder to use.  
>Matt: AADILRT A11 ATRIA +21 296
#note TALIARD#.  Ugh.  Lots of cool fits along row 2, RADIAL being the highest scoring word.
>Sam_K: CW F12 C.W +16 291
#note I think he had the other blank right after his bingo.  This play is certainly consistent with that.
>Matt: AADDLNO F2 LOAD +25 321
#note ADLAND# 2B is 48, not proficient in Collins enough yet to find that.  That said, after his last fish I liked clogging up the last potent section of the board.  
>Sam_K: ?EEGNNT 2F .ENGThEN +60 351
#note Scored as 61.  He really debated on postponing the bingo, with that last S out.  I think bingoing is right though, because I just have to make a small play at G3 and the lanes are very restricted.  There's enough volatility with this play that he should be able to hit back after my next play.
>Matt: AADLNTY 1L YALD +47 368
#note Easy call.  I still need some help to win this game though.
>Sam_K: ILY H1 I.LY +33 384
#note The X is still looming, so I think he has to continue to score.  I'm not that likely to bingo from the D or Y...
>Matt: AEINORT O1 .ERATION +80 448
#note ...but I luck into this beauty of a draw somehow.  
>Sam_K: CEIILOO N3 OLIO +16 400
#note Leaving him ICE to go out.  This is the right play.
>Matt: STWX G1 T.WS +38 486
#note Very happy to find this play, and surprised that it better than dropping the X for 25.  
>Sam_K: CEI N13 ICE +13 413
#note Somehow I added 448 and 38 and got 472.  WTF.  I really need to triple check my addition apparently.  At any rate, I'm just one back of the leader now, more than halfway into this tournament.  If this were a typical 20 game 3-day tournament I'd be playing for 1st.  But Nationals had to be 31 games didn't it?  Things are about to get real ugly.
