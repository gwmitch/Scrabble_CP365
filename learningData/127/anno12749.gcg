>Sam_R: AEIV D4 AIVE. +16 16
>Matt: LMNRRTV 5C V.RL +14 88
#note You can't make these racks up sometimes.  At least I'm up a bingo so far.
>Sam_R: AKU 7F AUK +22 38
>Matt: LMNRRTY -LMRY +0 88
#note Meh, not a lot of good options here.  
>Sam_R: EH 6F EH +22 60
>Matt: ?BNNORT 3B NOT +15 103
#note Didn't give me a letter for TWINBORN or NUTBROWN, the only 2 bingoes in this rack.  I figured he was close to a bingo and wanted to shut down the easiest lane to hit, but it opens up another lane anyway.  Didn't think about NAIVER, which makes TON the better play.  I think playing something at C8 making BRUSHING is a pretty good idea too.
>Sam_R: IMZ 2A MIZ +43 103
#note Ouch, wasn't expecting that.
>Matt: ?BCNRTY C8 CRY +23 126
#note CORYBANT is the only 8.  Going for extra turnover because, once again, I can't draw vowels.
>Sam_R: ADEINTU 1C AUDIENT +89 192
#note Ah crap this is getting away from me fast.
>Matt: ?ABFINT B10 FAINT +48 174
#note Didn't know FITNA#, that's the play for multiple reasons.
>Sam_R: AMOPY 15A PYOMA +57 249
#note Phony.  I apparently lost all my confidence in this game, just letting stuff go left and right.  It looked plausible to me, like a pussy mass or something like that.  Held it for a minute but then just said "Nice play".  
>Matt: ?ABDEEG J4 DEBA.GEd +70 244
#note fEEDBAG scores 76 at 4F.  
>Sam_R: AAS K6 AAS +24 273
#note Another phony, and I had a hunch CRUSHINGS* wasn't good, but I had ELNNORS on my rack post-bingo.  RONNELS just jumped out at me, but it looked weird at the same time.  Do I challenge this off, or do I let it go since it gives me a spot for my bingo that I'm like 80% sure of?  Decided to let it go.
>Matt: ELNNORS L1 RONNELS +74 318
>Matt: AEIIORT (challenge) +5 323
#note Held for quite a while and then challenged.  A tense walk up to the computer but I did remember RONNELS correctly.  As you'll see with his next rack, he almost has to challenge if he's 1% unsure. 
>Sam_R: ?BEJLOS 14E JOBLESs +78 351
#note Yeah, that plays at 1L for 103.  Quackle suggests holding onto the blank for now, and play JIBE for 42 or JEBEL for 40.  That is a lot of firepower to consume at once I guess, and the board is not completely shut down yet.  
>Matt: AEIIORT 15G OI +16 339
#note Damn you ST#!  OATIER# is 32, and keeps the pressure on, so that I don't have to bingo a 4th time to win.  
>Sam_R: EOX M1 EXO +35 386
#note This plays at A11 for 4 more.  He was setting up another big X play for next turn I believe, but when he saw my counterplay he was cursing himself.
>Matt: AEIRTTT N3 TITRATE +62 401
#note I have new life now.  This opens up two hotspots, and with 3 more E's unseen, my next draw is likely to hit whichever one he doesn't take, and hopefully that would be enough to carry me through the endgame.
>Sam_R: EORW O7 WORE +34 420
>Matt: DEEFOQU O1 FEED +39 440
#note I was too focused on this spot, and didn't see QUEP# for 50 or FIQUE for 42.  He's not bingoing with CGPW and 2 I's unseen, so I should aim for an outplay the very next turn.  FIQUE lookes like it has the best chance at doing that.
>Sam_R: CDGILPW 12A W.LD +24 444
#note He's gotta take away QI for 44.  Champ Player suggests WIG, presumably because CDILP is more potent than CGIP, but this keeps him even, and who knows, I may make a mistake.  
>Matt: IOQU 4G QUI. +15 455
#note Duh, QI for 24.  OU can be dumped in several spots next turn.  This is the only other play that wins 100% according to Champ Player.
>Sam_R: CGIP M9 PIC +18 462
>Matt: O A1 O. +12 467
#note I think we were both down under 3 minutes when this was all said and done.  He recounted but didn't find any errors.  A very tense and exciting game, even if we both made some pretty big mistakes (not challenging PYOMA*, EXO).  
>Matt:  (G) +4 471
