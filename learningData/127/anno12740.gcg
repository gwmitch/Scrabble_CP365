>Ross_Brown: HLOORTU H4 THURL +18 18
#note Ross: ROUTH is the play.
>Scott_Appel: ? -  +0 0
#note Ross: Challenge lost.
>Ross_Brown: AIOOPTZ I3 ZOO +29 47
#note Ross: Best.
>Scott_Appel: EI 7G I.E +5 5
>Ross_Brown: AAIOPRT J2 PART +32 79
#note Ross: Quackle likes (Z)OARIA. I'm hoping to cash in my A. Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the nature of Scott's prior play.
>Scott_Appel: AEIILST 1I LAITIES +81 86
>Ross_Brown: ?AEIIOO -AIOO +0 79
>Scott_Appel: INY 3I ..YIN +34 120
>Ross_Brown: ?AAEGII 4M AI +4 83
#note Ross: Quackle wants me to exchange again.
>Scott_Appel: FNNUY F7 FUNNY +20 140
>Ross_Brown: ?AEGINS O1 .IGNAgES +81 164
#note Ross: I see the double-double, but I'm willing to give up 11 points to take away the triple lane. I don't look at the Y, and thus miss the pretty G(Y)pSEIAN and S(Y)NErGIA.
>Scott_Appel: LO L1 .O.L +16 156
>Ross_Brown: AAMPTVW 11C WAV. +26 190
#note Ross: Quackle prefers VAMP(Y). I didn't like the leave from MAW.
>Scott_Appel: AHN C10 H.AN +20 176
>Ross_Brown: ABGJMPT 12B J.B +32 222
#note Ross: Best.
>Scott_Appel: ACDEENR J7 RECANED +70 246
>Ross_Brown: ADGIMPT B12 .IMP +32 254
#note Ross: Best, except for the unexpected M(E)DIGAP.
>Scott_Appel: DORTU 12I R.DOUT +14 260
>Ross_Brown: ADEGKQT N10 QA. +32 286
#note Ross: I judge the Q(U)* plays too risky.
>Scott_Appel: DEOT 11H TO.ED +23 283
>Ross_Brown: DEGIKLT 9D GI.K +14 300
#note Ross: Just trying to improve my rack; there's no real best play; though IK(A)T is nice, the G doesn't hold much promise with the unseen tiles, and that's why I feel safe hanging it out.
>Scott_Appel: CEER 4D EREC... +18 301
#note Ross: Scott seems to perceive a threat from the G, which hints that he may not be holding the second blank.
>Ross_Brown: BDEELST 5B BETEL +22 322
#note Ross: Emboldened, I play as many tiles as I can without courting undue risk. Another advantage is that this creates a productive spot for the V, should I get it.
>Scott_Appel: GOO A13 GOO +32 333
>Ross_Brown: ?DEOSSV O12 SODS +27 349
#note Ross: My hunches pay off, and Scott now has such dreck that I'm comfortable with this play; there is no eight-letter bingo to this S.
>Scott_Appel: AFIMRUX 6A FIX +30 363
>Ross_Brown: ?EEVW 3A WEaVE +29 378
#note Ross: Best.
>Ross_Brown:  (AMRU) +12 390
