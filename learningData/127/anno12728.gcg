#note I challenged.  It's the only challenge I lost in the entire tournament.  I wrote the alphagram down and didn't recognize it.  This means one of two things: 1) It's not good 2) It's super low-prob.  With three R's and three E's, that's no surprise.  "One who renders??? BALONEY!!!"

#note I'm in serious trouble.
>Susan_Love: AJSY 12I JAYS +48 230
#note VERY serious trouble.
>Tasha_Asberry: AEIIMNO 13E AMINO +19 104
#note I missed a fishing opportunity here.  13I OI looks pretty good right about now!  I didn't even consider it.

>Tasha_Asberry: EEGILRT 12C TIGER +25 158
#note I knew I missed a bingo here.  I KNOW there's a bingo in EEGILNRT and after nearly five minutes, I couldn't remember it.  That's what I get for not reviewing high prob stuff.  HUGE GIGANTIC ENORMOUS COSTLY mistake.

>Tasha_Asberry: CEILRTZ N11 RITZ +30 188
#note The only other play I considered was 11B CITE.  
>Susan_Love: OY 15N YO +32 355
#note Oops, what did she play here?  I only wrote down RITZY.  Whatever it was it was 33 points.  But that can't be right so she must have overscored by a point.  Had to have been either YA, YE, or YO.  ....it's YO.

>Susan_Love: AGP 11B GAP +12 367
>Tasha_Asberry: ?ACCEET N2 CECA +18 247
#note I spent about three minutes here.  The only other play I considered was 11B GAPE., which sims very highly.  Then playing AGAPE/something that hits the 3WS (hopefully a bingo or setup) next turn.  However, I looked at the pool and thought that play wouldn't work.  She plays something like B9 VUG (I know it's gonna happen), then I'll have to play something like 9A AVE and "game over!"  with an 100+ loss.  Instead, I tried to find the second highest scoring play and hoped that the crap was on her rack and not in the bag.  
>Susan_Love: AK -  +0 367
#note This is the part when my blood started boiling.  Actually, my blood starting getting hot sometime between SPANGLES and RITZY.  Susan had no idea how annoyed I was though.  I was the picture of perfect stoicness all the way to the computer and back.  And all throughout the game too.
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EEIIRT B9 RI. +6 253
#note The only other fish I considered was 2L RICE (that sims best), but if she has the right letters, I'm done.  I chose RIG because that's much harder for her to block.  DAK scores, but opens up a hook.  Worse-case scenario is she plays 10A K(I)F.  Then I'll play 8A IT and hope for the best. 
>Susan_Love: AK A8 KA +20 387
#note Would have went at 1K had I played RICE.  
>Tasha_Asberry: ?EEFILT C3 FELsITE +76 329
#note Good, the crap is on her rack.  High pointers too.  I hope a V isn't in the bag.
>Susan_Love: DFUUVVW 4B D.V +14 401
>Tasha_Asberry: O 3B O. +8 337
#note Yes!  Almost like I planned it!
>Tasha_Asberry:  (FUUVW) +28 365
#note Final score recorded as 396-365.
