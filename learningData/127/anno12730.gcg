>Ross_Brown: AENOORZ H4 ZONAE +48 48
#note Ross: Best.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADEEEIR 4H .AIRE +28 28
>Ross_Brown: AILORSU M3 US +19 67
#note Ross: Rather hard to believe there isn't a bingo here somewhere.
>Dave_Wiegand: DEEHORT 6D THRE.ODE +68 96
>Ross_Brown: ?AEILOR 8A AEROLIt. +74 141
#note Ross: I miss s(H)OALIER for 90.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADEEJTU 5C JEU +32 128
>Ross_Brown: GGIKLVW B6 VI.W +18 159
#note Ross: WIGL(ET) scores more but is dangerous; I'm pretty sure I won't be able to take advantage of it given my leave.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADENSST I6 .DS +19 147
>Ross_Brown: AGGKLRS 10B SKAG +24 183
#note Ross: Best, except for the dangerous GARG(ET).
>Dave_Wiegand: AAEINST C3 TA. +20 167
>Ross_Brown: CGLLMNR 4A CR.M +32 215
#note Ross: Best.
>Dave_Wiegand: AEINORS 2G ERASION +62 229
>Ross_Brown: BEGLLNO 1D GLOBE +40 255
#note Ross: Best.
>Dave_Wiegand: AHLMOOP 1L HOLP +52 281
>Ross_Brown: AEILNRT K6 .NTAILER +66 321
#note Ross: Best, but risks a big AX play.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADGIMTW J10 MAW +31 312
>Ross_Brown: BEINOOX 11D BOX +34 355
#note Ross: Quackle prefers (T)OXIN, but I'm reluctant to open more bingo lines against Dave.
>Dave_Wiegand: DGIIITU -GIIITU +0 312
>Ross_Brown: ?EINOQY 12D YO +30 385
#note Ross: Quackle wants me to spend the blank on QuEY and widen the lead, but a (Q)U.. comeback is quite likely.
>Dave_Wiegand: CDEIUVY 12G CUD..ED +30 342
#note Ross: Indeed, Dave would have had (Q)UEY for 48.
>Ross_Brown: ?EFINPQ 13C FEN +26 411
#note Ross: I consider EQ(U)IP holding the case blank, but too much could go wrong. This closes one bingo line, and hides the Q so that Dave can keep worrying about drawing it.
>Dave_Wiegand: AFIITVY 3E IVY +25 367
>Ross_Brown: ?EGIIPQ H11 Q.IPu +45 456
#note Ross: It's now clear that Dave can't bingo at all across this (blank) U, nor across the D, nor from the P, so this is safe.
>Dave_Wiegand: AFINTTU A1 FIN.A +30 397
>Ross_Brown: EGINT M7 TINGE. +10 466
#note Ross: NI(D)GET for six more.
>Ross_Brown:  (TTU) +6 472
