>Noah: ?EINRUY I8 ENqUIRY +63 81
#note I found this decision a bit tough. I8 leads to a much more closed board, but also gives a great scoring spot for Carl along column H. G8 is much more open, but doesn't give a great scoring spot. I preferred I8, because even after a solid column H score, Carl will still be a bit behind, this time on a pretty closed boadd.

>Noah: BEIIRTU H14 BI +19 163
#note I also considered CUBITI, but it is just way too nice to Carl. I like this, making preventing row 15 from being open, and hoping to do something about the top of the board later. One play I didn't think of is (O)UREBI, which is pretty strong. I don't think the bingo chances through OUREBI are too big for him, while it makes the right side of the board readily blockable next turn and opens plenty of decent (but not too good) scoring options. I like OUREBI.
>Carl: AN G8 AN +6 102
>Noah: ADEIRTU 12G AD.EU +23 186
#note I also thought about (q)UA ((V)AU is the best place to play AU), but this board didn't seem terribly promising for bingoing with DEIRT. I liked this because it blocked the main sevens lane and opened one which required Carl to open great options for me.

>Carl: HOO B8 OOH +31 254
>Noah: ABEFNRU E5 FUB +20 298
#note I like FUBAR better, because there is one S left, and the case S is a pretty potent weapon on this board.
>Carl: ADEGJ D1 GADJE +37 291
>Noah: ADEINRU 1D .UIDER +24 322
#note I wish I had had more time to think about this play. I don't really even know where to begin. I'm pretty sure a fish isn't warranted here. DUNGIER is the other option, but I thought the N was worth enough here to keep for a 3 point sacrifice. 
>Carl: DEEILRV D8 LIVER.ED +80 371
#note I held this for a bit, almost certain it was good, but thinking there was a slight change LIVIERED was good instead (I knew DEEIILRV was one of those two). Spread is important enough in this tournament that challenging wasn't warranted, though I knew this put me out of contention for first.
>Noah: AHILNPR C7 LIP +22 344
#note Not a good play, because I had spent the last few minutes of my time thinking about LIVERIED. It ended up being fine though, because Carl fell for my trap.
>Carl: AAEOSTZ C2 ZA +39 410
#note Can you find the best play?
