>Brett: AELNOTT 6C TONAL +17 23
>Max: EIMNORT B2 VOLTA +28 58
#note The way the games have been going, I was expecting some kind of overlap on tonal but volta is normally a good play.
>Brett: EIMNORT D3 REM.TION +72 95
#note Happy to see the line still there.  Bingos without blanks or s's are powerful.  MOTIONER at D5 is best with the same amount of points though.  
>Max: NNTUY C9 TUNNY +23 81
>Brett: AEEHINR B10 FEU +32 127
>Max: EHILW A11 WHILE +61 142
#note That hurt!  I was thinking "not too many big -un words."  That was almost like a bingo.  
>Brett: ACEHINR 5D .OP +26 153

#note Really liked this DOGVANE play.  I probably woudl have not seen that.  
>Brett: BIIJKTY K5 JIB +31 227

#note not sure wtf I was thinking here.  I think I was thinking about intersect.  I had plenty of time
>Max: ADIISSX M1 HEDGES +31 267
#note oops!

>Brett: CEINRST 15A .NTICERS +83 381
#note I should have seen this the first time around.  Really really wish I had seen SNITC(h)ER for 198 ponts in one move.  He was really frustrated after not blocking my move after seeing my tiles when I played a phony.
>Max: ?AEIORR 14F hOARIER +63 330
#note Q want him no to bingo but to play O(h)IA since there are only 4 tiles left in the bag.  I would have still had a bingo down on 14 (READIEd), etc. though.  
>Brett: ?ADEEIR 3F DERAIlE. +61 442
#note I really thought there were more options with those tiles but there are not
>Brett:  (IQSX) +40 482
#note Still working on improving my vision, and working on my counting skills. (Ha)  Nasty Final draw.  Max was not happy.
