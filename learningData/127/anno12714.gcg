#note On a regular opening, I would probably play MEANER. I thought about EME, but that was still pretty useful for Nigel, so I just kept the best leave I could think of and went for a bingo next turn.

#note Confused with GERMANIC.
>Nigel]: AHIL K11 HAIL +34 104
>Noah: AADJNNS K5 JNA.A +26 100
#note I didn't think of NINJA 13J, which is interesting. The problem is, he has a 40% chance of having an S (HAIL being out of a pretty variable rack). I think that is a risk worth taking. 
>Nigel]: EFNY F6 FE.NY +27 131
>Noah: DINOSUU L3 DUO +17 117
>Nigel]: ACIO E3 CIAO +17 148
>Noah: BDINRSU 15H BURS. +29 146
#note There are a few good plays here: this, BUD at M5 or E10, or B(LI)NI. I didn't really like BUD on this board, because the S doesn't seem especially strong. What about BLINI? It is an interesting option. I don't think Nigel's range after CIAO is strong enough to pass it up.

#note I keep missing plays this game! This time, VOW gives me a chance to make some waves, but somehow I didn't think of it.
>Nigel]: EHOORT M1 HOOTER +36 258
>Noah: EINOTTV 13I OV..E +18 194
#note Other options are HOT, THIO, and OLIVE. I didn't see the latter. OLIVE is a much better play than this is.
