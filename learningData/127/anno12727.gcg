#note Ick. I even thought about looking carefully for cool fits through the I, but figured there wasn't likely to be anything, and I was hoping to play a quick game to avoid missing my train/being stuck in NYC due to the hurricane. It's a whole different game after 2A IRENICAL.

#note I miss Mack's winning play, and set up an easier one for him to find. 2000 rated skillz. I don't know for sure if he saw BAAED anyway. 12J IFS to block it is my only winner. I swear I don't suck at endgame, it was the hurricane's fault...haha, if only that were true. Congrats Mack!
