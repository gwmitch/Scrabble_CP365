#note No idea. This looks to be tied around second with several other moves, with HIVE being the winner. Weird spot either way.

#note don't like this spot. yes I have PIQUE but that gives three big hooks on the triple line. I also thought of just playing U(P). My move is just a bit ahead of the fish. PUN is another good option.

#note five U's so far. I really should've played YEW, didn't realize that UU wasn't as bad with an N to go with.

Didn't think of UNWRUNG. I barely recognize that as it is.
