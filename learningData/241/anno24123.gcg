>Joshua_Sokol: AEFMORW H4 WAFER +30 30
#note Seemed between this and WOMERA, MO was the better leave, so I played this. But overlap potential with the F is interesting, so perhaps I should just play WOMERA. Would have worked out better, but I think I still like WAFER!
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: AENRRRT 5D NARR.TER +82 82

>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ELOV 4A VOLE +26 108
>Joshua_Sokol: FOU G7 FOU +22 147
#note Not sure what my leave was. FOU seemed clear, though, from what I remember.

>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: AEGSTWZ 6B ZAG +37 175
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEENSU K8 DENUDES +72 247
#note Didn't know the anagrams. Looked correct to sacrifice the 3 points for scoring defense though.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: BMO 8K ..MOB +30 205
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNNTV 13H VIN.AL +20 267
#note Let's just say I missed NONVITAL, because I must have done something horribly wrong this game. You'll see why later.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: IX 6H .IX +56 261
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIINPT 2A .PTING +26 293
#note I wanted to play defense here. But maybe this board was indefensible. Maybe I should just play GI(V)EN
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ADEEGKN 10A TONLETS +68 329
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ADEEGKN --  -68 261
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEHIJL 1F AJI +33 326
#note Unfortunate mistake from Panupol, as FOUS* is Collins-only.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ELNOSTT I5 ..NT +15 276
#note 14I TE(S)TON is nice!
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHILO H11 HE.EA +36 362

>Joshua_Sokol: ADGHILO A10 ALGOID +35 397
#note This put me up 96, I figured I was in great shape. Unfortunately I missed DIALOG in the same spot for 8 more. Perhaps that was what did it for me. But I liked blocking all of the good lanes at once besides the B. 
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ACEKRST O8 .RACKETS +113 414
#note Besides the B. Even so, Panupol is only a 50/50 favourite to win here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEHIII A7 EH +32 429
#note But I just drew IIIEE? out of the bag! What an incredible swing! I cannot win this game, now. It's completely out of reach, no matter what I draw. Just have to hope Panupol will miscalculate the endgame or something, or that I have a win somehow. 
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: ADINSTW N3 STAW +27 441
#note This is the play that I saw won it for Panupol, but Quackle sees all. N1 IDS to set up TWAIN takes the trophy for best endgame. But this did the trick.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIIY 12K .YE +26 455
#note I missed NID(I), actually, but this is still correct. If I see NIDI, I still need to hope he misses it.
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn: DIN I10 NID. +13 454
>Panupol_Sujjayakorn:  (III?) +6 460
