>Kevin_Leeds: EEPV 9C VEEP +24 24
>David_Turissini: DFIRSTU 7F TURF +24 52
#note Quackle gives a slight edge to 7H FUD.  I'm happy with the points.

#note I wasn't sure what to do here.  Quackle says K5 (C)ELLO

>Kevin_Leeds: BINOV 10G BOVIN. +13 299
#note The second blank was one of the last tiles in the bag, and he was trying to prevent me bingo-ing.
