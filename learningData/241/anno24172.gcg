>Will: EHILNTW F10 HEWN +33 140

>Mike: AENOSST H8 .ONTESSA +83 198
>Will: BDIILTU 5E ..BUILD +22 188
#note Honestly surprised by C11 DUI performing so well according to Q, but it appears to bingo just as much as UPBUILD while allowing way fewer points to Mike - looks like the BILT leave is very strong with the A and that it's likely to stay open.
>Mike: BEJOORV B2 JO. +22 220
>Will: AEIMNTU I9 MU +16 204
#note Ugh, really needed to examine how often just dumping the U hit in various places around the board here. It's far, far superior to playing MU, not just because it hits so much...
>Mike: BCEORRV J10 BEVOR +29 249
#note ...but responses like this are brutal for me.
>Will: AEIIINT 4K INIA +11 215
#note Shrug, don't know.
>Mike: AACEHIR 3J CHIA +31 280
>Will: EIRTUYZ H2 YUZ. +26 241
>Mike: AAEEIRT C12 AE +10 290
>Will: EGGIORT B10 GREGO +29 270
#note Quackle likes GOATIER. GREGO blocks a lot of my potential bingos whereas GOATIER opens more stuff...I see it.

>Mike: ?ELNOSS N4 .NiSOLES +59 367

#note Couldn't concoct a plan that didn't depend on Mike phonying.
