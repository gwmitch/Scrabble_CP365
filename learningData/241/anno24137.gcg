>Matthew: BCINRWY 8F BR.WNY +14 14
#note Surprised how much Q hated my play.   Saw the many other possibilities, but liked cleary my clunky rack and opening board against someone iver whom I have a big rating advantage

EAU 5M, really?  Feels too early to be this aggressive
>B_Gottlieb: ADZ O1 ADZ +51 169
>Matthew: ?EILOPT 3B PILOTEd +70 146
#note TOECLIP and others finished a little higher

>B_Gottlieb: IKN D1 KI.N +26 200
>Matthew: ACENOOR 1A COO. +30 193
#note I liked ER as part of the leave on an open board, but for 9 extra points and given the disproportionately high number of those letters left in the pool, I get COOKER rating better
>B_Gottlieb: ADFRT E9 DRAFT +21 221
>Matthew: AAEENOR 12D A.ORE +18 211
#note ANOA D10.   Ir rates ahead in equity by even more than the difference in raw points.  Surprising to me, since the -ER heaviness is still in play
>B_Gottlieb: AEEGNRS 13G ENRAGES +75 296

#note SAPHENA new to me

>Matthew: AENPSSU --  -48 237
#note HELP!
My phony aside, why does PURS 10C rate so well?  It mucks up a wide open bingo lane and I'm behind      Q says is 17% to win
>B_Gottlieb: DEV N6 DEV +22 338
#note Figured the hook was new, but I'm trying to win and needed to sneak out an extra turn
>Matthew: AENPSSU -  +0 237
#note challenge
>B_Gottlieb: IW K11 WI. +24 362
>Matthew: AENPSSU 14A PUNAS +24 261
#note My play is best in terms of equity.  Q gives NEAPS a 4% chance of winning from that same spot, but it's easy to block.  I'm dubious.
