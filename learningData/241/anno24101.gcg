#note I had thought of BUMF on my last turn but forgot about it here. Not playing 13K FROW is a fairly noticeable error.

>Mack: AGINOPS 14E SOAPING +74 340
#note I was disappointed he blocked SAPOG(EN)IN but at least I had this as a backup
>Kevin: AAEINRT F1 RATANIE. +62 281
>Mack: CEEERUY 15F EYE +37 377
#note I feel like I am just as likely to lose after CURRY, since if I draw junk to EEE and Kevin bingos the game is tied, whereas EYE basically forces him to triple-triple right now. 
>Kevin: ??CLOOP 1A COrPO.aL +167 448
#note His only 3*3, nice find
>Mack: ACEMRTU 13G CAM +36 413
#note All of the sudden I need to bingo to win while also staying within striking distance, so this looks good
>Kevin: AQST N1 QATS +35 483
>Mack: EIIORTU 1N .I +33 446
#note The only play that has a chance. I win 1/8 of the time, if I draw the R, because Kevin can neither outrun me nor stop be from bingoing with A1 COURTIER or N7 ULTERIOR. Plus, several other draws give me one bingo so still force Kevin to track properly and find the correct place to block, so in reality my chances are slightly higher than 1/8 given my opponent is a human.
