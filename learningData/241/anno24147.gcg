#note not a great play. many options. I thought about GAT at M11 and ERGATE at H10. My interpretation of Morris's last play is very important. He probably has a really strong leave, or he might have played PUD at J12. Is he hoping to triple-triple? Two good choces Quackle suggests are fishing the G with DOGE and TAGGER through the G which will hopefully block some bingos. EAGLET also keeps a stronger leave than ERGATE. I take DOGE in retrospect.
>Morris_Greenberg: LUX 6G LUX +23 162
#note again, this should've been a colossal warning sign that he intended to triple-triple since LUX is available at J12. A huge oversight in retrospect.
>JD: DIORRTT H10 .DITOR +24 179
#note right block for the wrong reasons - terrible time to open a triple-triple after two consecutive fishes

#note ANR is nothing special, might as well take the points for INTRON.

#note need to open (and draw the blank)

>JD: EEIKLMT C10 MILKE. +24 309
#note trying to flip some tiles and draw the blank. MEEK is a lot more points, but the 4 Is in the pool are scary, and it kinda closes the board besides the new SMEEK hook
>Morris_Greenberg: DIINORS D6 SORDINI +78 418
#note I'm obviously in huge trouble. I was just hoping for him to open the bag unreasonably and pull the VY and hit BEATIFIC. what else?
>JD: ABEFITU N14 U. +8 317
#note yikes, I'm in bad shape. I was already down to a couple of minutes and could find no plays I liked, so I fished for BEATIFIC at A8 (and LIFTABLE as backup chance). BEATIFIC is 98 points, likely not enough, but at least I threaten a big play in case Morris totally screws up.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEIRSY 4E gREASI.Y +72 490
>JD: ABEFITU F2 FI.E +15 332
#note I went over by two minutes, but found by far my best endgame - blocking VLOG and LOVE and simultaneously threatening AFIRE/TABU while saving good outs elsewhere.
>Morris_Greenberg: LOV H2 OV. +6 496
#note morris figured out afterward that VINO is 2 better.
