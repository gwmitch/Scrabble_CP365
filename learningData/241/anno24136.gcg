#note didn't think of 7D EEEW or 7E EEW.  i'm ok with WHEREON although it is pretty defensively weak. -2.5

#note overreaction. FEE F2 is obvious and keeps an ok leave. i need to think carefully about high equity plays when i am down as i need to bingo soon. EEU is not going to make me bingo soon, and FETCH gives him back a lot of points. -5.5

#note i wasn't sure enough of DUFFER or RUFFED - a pretty bad mistake. -6

#note im gonna put him on an ERS leave. i just hate opening after that fish, but it still seems like the best play. what choice do i have? exch AEQ is pretty reasonable. ACME D3 seems like the right closed play but it's so bad.

#note i saw G11 TOW for 26. it sims higher than my play, but my play has to be correct, since i cannot block a good lane here. right? one would say i'm giving him a shot at scoring a lot there though. this decision may have ended up mattering at the end. -2.5

#note the best endgame play here is LOOIES. it ties if i draw the P and loses to everything else (including the blank). i wanted to play 7A OI. he might not see BEDPANS or the other wins, although DARNS 9K is easy enough to see. i was super low on time and just played something that scored. :(
>baron: ADNNPRS M13 PAD +25 395
#note didn't expect to draw the blank..
>cesar: ?O O12 Ox +10 383
#note i did see 7A Oi so i don't know why i played this. -1
>cesar:  (NNRS) +8 391
#note i played OK but took too long on stibine and didn't have enough time to figure out an endgame i was going to lose anyway. missing DUFFER was a pretty bad mistake, though.
