#note This game started off on a low note, by my missing (A)IOLI, which un-triples my I's and doesn't give much back to Mike.

#note also blocks his only bingo! Don't make mistakes

#note Aha, SILICIDE. I knew SALICINE, not SILICIDE. 12C DISCI also looks good for the board.

#note In this context, I think this is the correct play. I have to take a risk somehow, and playing 6B HOY to set up a hook I don't have seems to succeed less often than this. I can catch him with crap and catch up, or I can draw well and catch up that way.

#note trying to prevent big scores with VOTE(R) did not work out. Too bad there weren't any good plays that went elsewhere

#note Can you believe that I chickened out of B(A)RONNE against the Baron himself? That would have been an embarrassing phony. Thought it might just be a French word, since BARONESS is also a word that means the same thing.

#note Here is where my game crashes and burns. I've already lost, but I missed both Q spots on the board, and instead went for EQUITES in two spots. BEQUEST worked too, but I was unsure of that one, so decided an IU draw was what I was going for. I played EL here to distract Mike, to induce mistakes. He might think the Q is still out there, and that by drawing 2/4 he has a 50% shot of drawing it. Anyways, for spread, it's best I just play 14A QI. I only miss if I draw ERW
>Mike_Baron: I O7 .I +6 501
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEQSST 14G BEET +15 309
#note I mistracked the T here, and thought for sure he had kept DEIRTU. So went for the 50-50 shot of drawing an out with a U. Still missing QAID and QI
>Mike_Baron: DEEIRUU 13J UREIDE +16 517
#note I was confused because I thought he could Q stick me by blocking Q(AID), which I finally saw. But he noted QI when the game ended and I grabbed my face in shame.
