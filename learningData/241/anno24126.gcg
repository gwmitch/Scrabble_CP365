#note it seems like i should play VEND here for defensive purposes at least. i didn't like it very much at all. -4

>marlene: AGI A12 .IGA +24 156
>cesar: EEHHMOV O1 HEM. +33 188
#note -2 HOVE at 4D. i think quackle wants me to play some defense as that's potentially a huge spot, plus HEM is a better leave. i hate giving up points.

>cesar: CEHNOTV M7 H.C +24 212
#note i can sense she's close to a bingo.  M7 HIVE is a nice move because i might be able to score if she bingoes, and it leaves the best leave. i overreacted and did HIC to try to keep it a little closed, but the V is just not good - this is a big mistake. -8.5   --  I also considered 4D HOVE/VETO which also mitigate a big lane. in conclusion i'm not really sure what the best move is.

#note i wrote a star next to this move because i was running out of time. i'm a bit in trouble but i have a blank and i can bingo next turn if i do something good here. NAV gives me the best bingo %, but quackle likes something like 4A OVEN - it scores more and i feel it's not that easy for her to hit an O there. it does give up a few more points though. -5.5

#note she missed emboli, but so did i. i wonder if YIN is better for that.
>cesar: EIRS A4 IRES +20 365
#note there were a couple of key moves. i gotta find DIDST.. and block the lane at row 4 early. hate losing the first game >.<
