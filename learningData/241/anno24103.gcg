#note a better choice here is ChOREGI and challenge the C# hook. yes i was aware that GEORgIC takes an S and i like that.

#note i spent a long time on this move. i saw OXER but i don't like it. it's easy for him to block, and i create an S hook that i don't have in case he doesn't block it. quackle really likes moves like that though (and it even prefers 14K EXERT over my move); it likes OXER 12 pts better than mine. really?? a better fish is L6 ROC instead of REC, though. tough move, and i knew REC wouldn't "sim" right but i might play ROC next time. someone please give me a very convincing argument for OXER.

one reasonable argument is the fact that REC/ROC actually give him back a lot of points as well, according to quackle it's defensively indistinguishable from OXER. maybe that's why?

#note i keep bleeding valuable equity!!! BUG for E11 is 10 pts better.
>Mack: ADEIIRT M11 DE.I +22 232
>Cesar: EENNSTU E9 NUT +14 351
#note 11E NIEVE or 14K EXIT to not give him a free lane... although i'm more likely to use that lane (i have the case S and there are no Ds either).
>Mack: AIOORTY 2I TOYO +18 250
>Cesar: EEENQRS 1G REE +11 362
#note another interesting move here. i was very tempted to play 1D SERENE but couldn't stomach it for whatever reason. i missed the awesome 14K EXINE though for 19 more, although only SQUEG will give me massive pts there -- two Us unseen make the Q not as bad.
