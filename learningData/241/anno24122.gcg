#note I didn't think TINNILY was good. Probably was a little bit nervous, especially since I wasn't expecting to play on the livestream this game at first.

#note Championship player agrees. Joel can bingo with VIBRATOR and VIBRATOS at A1 and TRAVOIS at 13J, but I wanted to empty the bag to prevent a play like 7J PER, which woukd make TRAVOIS difficult to block in both spots if he were to draw it. If Joel has the Q, he clearly loses, and if I draw the Q, I have QI in two spots for over 20, so should be able to squeak it out after KAIF.

#note This is the best he can do.

#note Overall I'm very happy with how I played this tournament. I made only two 20+ point mistakes (TINNILY in this game and COOLIBAH in the Steve Bush game), which is excellent for this long a tournament. A bunch of small mistakes here and there, but overall I was pretty consistent and was thinking soundly strategically. 

Congratulations to David Gibson on winning the championship and thanks to everyone for another fabulous nationals!
