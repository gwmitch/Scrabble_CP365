#note coannotated with Joey K. Maybe NAY to set up BROWNY?
>JD: AEEIPRS 9B APERIES +72 90
#note too many extra points for APERIES versus PEARLIES
>Joey_K: FFIOUVY C9 .UFFY +32 59
#note POUFFY (stand-alone 6) definitely better than PUFFY

#note APO/OX sets up the C nicely and creates a great diversion. Joey needs the lane.

>Joey_K: AAOPRSU D12 AA +19 132
>JD: AHIKMRT N9 THIRAM +40 251
#note thought about either HAKIM or IRK because I know his leave is pretty strong and I didn't want to give up a 100+-point bingo on row 15, but this seemed like too many points. I played THIRAM instead of THAIRM to maximize my chances of scoring with my K next turn
>Joey_K: AOPRRSU 15H UPROARS +92 224
>JD: ADDIKMR 12L DI.K +28 279
#note seems like MIKADO might be competitive, but it also plays the last A and the bag is quite consonant-heavy.
>Joey_K: BEEGNNQ E11 ENG +21 245
#note some other scoring plays like GIBER, but those block the only Q spot on the board. Playing the Q now also looks like it's not going anywhere.
>JD: ADLMORU M10 AM.D +29 308
#note MODULE takes out 75% of joey's possible bingos, which is a big deal, but also doesn't score much, and there are plenty of ways I can still lose. Still probably more proactive than AMID.
>Joey_K: BEENNNQ H1 BENNE. +27 272
>JD: DEILORU G2 DOUR +16 324
#note Interesting plays available - also DUI or DOURINE which are quite proactive in terms of limiting bingos. DUI leaves me very vulnerable to a Q draw. 
>Joey_K: ??ELNQV B6 VEL. +17 289
#note sweet play by joey trying to draw a big Q bingo for the win. also could've tried VENA or ELVEN.
>JD: EEIILST D3 STEELI. +16 340
#note empty the bag and hope he doesn't hit his bingo
>Joey_K: ??CNQTZ C2 Qi +22 311
#note joey's best play is the ridiculous CADENZA setting up two Q spots.
