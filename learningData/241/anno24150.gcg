>JD: EHKOPRX F7 K.PH +21 21
#note general mission against Ian is to keep the board tight so he has to make non-bingo plays. CHOKER sims best and is probably too many points to pass up, with some chance of PAX/PIX for lotsa points
>Ian_Weinstein: CEIQU 10B QUIC.E +40 66
>JD: AEFOORX 11G FOREX +35 56
#note poor move that tends to give up a ton of points - POOF is a really nice waiting move that blocks many of his bingos.
>Ian_Weinstein: GHN D8 .H.NG +22 88
#note very fortunate that he couldn't play a cheap play at 10J. he had six consonants and blank, he later said.
>JD: ABDENOO 10J BOO +30 86
#note wasn't sure between BOO and BOOED. There are so many Es and both blanks out there, so BOOED is probably worth it.
>Ian_Weinstein: PS H10 S.P +29 117
>JD: ABDENTT M8 BATTED +26 112
#note I had been looking for CHING extensions, but evidently not on this turn. the pool is full of beautiful letters to fill in my rack.
>Ian_Weinstein: NNOT 12J NON.T +25 142
>JD: ?DLNNRV 9L L.ND +7 119
#note moment of truth. exchange, or block what looks like a clear setup for an S? the reason that I didn't exchange was that the pool was phenomenally vowel-heavy (31/57 remaining letters are vowels). However, two or three consonants draws will still kill me (about 40% of the time), which is far too much to sacrifice, and bingos hitting the SCRAWL hook will still score plenty. If I assume a leave of ST, LAND almost draws level, but still not quite.
>Ian_Weinstein: ?AEILOZ O2 sLEAZOI. +104 246
#note youch.
>JD: ?FJNORV -FJV +0 119
#note quackle is interested in keeping the F on an exchange so that my bingos score better, even though NOR? does bingo a bit more often. I agree with Quackle, might as well play for a 90-point bingo. FJORDS would be the play if I had a lead, but surely can't catch me up in this game.

#note likely game over, although I still have two good lanes.
>JD: ADEIIOW 4I .IAOW +20 229
#note maybe 2x2s can still fit.
>Ian_Weinstein: DEEIMST 5E MEDI.TES +102 447
#note ...and by that I mean, his 2x2 can still fit. he was actually apologetic
