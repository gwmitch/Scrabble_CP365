#note Racks like this are super fun to make setup plays with! Unfortunately, Quackle thinks I'm being overly cute and wants me to play JAR at 16D.

#note Probably not a good choice here - with a simple play like TA/A(GIN), the board is dead and the game is mostly over. I should play something like (S)ITUP

#note I saw plays down the L column but completely spaced on EST, which allows me to play NEWT at L2. Apparently, that wins with 3/8 unseen tiles. Nothing else wins with more than 2. I saw that this play would probably win if I pulled an A and he missed ANTR(UM) as an out and maybe I'd be ok with some other vowel pulls but then I started to run out of time and just did this.

#note Apparently Mike could bingo out with SAINTDO(m) for 77... oops! He had mistracked here and thought I had NRRU and couldn't go out.

#note But I didn't have NRRU at all!!!
