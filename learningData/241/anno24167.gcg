#note A strange position here. I liked playing this and holding the two esses, which are shaping up to be big tiles here. I can make them *bigger* tiles by playing J(O)HN, or I can put the emphasis on the J by playing NOH or SOH above voyage and setting up JO(W) draws, or I can just score 41 now. Hmmmm. 
>Rafi_Stern: X F5 .X +25 51
>Matt_Canik: EHNSSWZ 7G W.Z +29 98
#note Between Rafi likely being in bingo range and me holding two esses, I think this is a solid play. 
>Rafi_Stern: ?AACHIR 4H .RAnCHIA +80 131
>Matt_Canik: EHNSSSU O3 H.USEN +27 125
#note SUCHNESS? ok scrabble...
>Rafi_Stern: AMM N2 MA.M +25 156
>Matt_Canik: DLNPSST J2 PL.NT +15 140
#note This is the part of the game where I forget to draw vowels even though 31/63 tiles are vowels. I thought about playing PLAT or PLATS to set up the front S but the esses are so strong with BEWIGS that I thought not to waste them
>Rafi_Stern: ?AEOQRU K6 EQUAtOR +82 238
>Matt_Canik: DFGNRSS 9J F.NG +10 150
#note Still no vowels, although F(JO)RD or F(JO)RDS may be a better idea
>Rafi_Stern: AILU 12J U.IAL +10 248
#note I held this for a while because I'm bad
>Matt_Canik: DDRSSTT M11 D.RT +10 160
>Rafi_Stern: AFIKLOR N14 OI +8 256
>Matt_Canik: DEKSSTU O12 SKED +49 209
#note Finally vowels! But I get so caught up on deciding if SKED is good that I completely overlook playing TUSKED instead!!! A big and pivotal mistake. 
>Rafi_Stern: EILOT 10F TOILE. +16 272
>Matt_Canik: CLNSTTU E1 UNC.. +10 219
#note If I had seen/known (I)NCULT I'd likely play that, otherwise I feel the need to open up the board makes this ok. 
>Rafi_Stern: AADFIR 11C AFRAID +27 299
>Matt_Canik: ELNOSTT 13E TONLETS +77 296
#note We have a game!
>Rafi_Stern: AEPRY 14B REPAY +51 350
>Matt_Canik: DEINORV 12A VIDEO +43 339
#note I'm hoping that if I can catch Rafi with 0 or 1 consonants, I can outrun him with this play. Q much prefers I fish with ON 13B and also has VIREO ahead of this - I guess DN allows me to go out in one more often?
>Rafi_Stern: EEEEIST 1D S.ITE +18 368
>Matt_Canik: BINOR C9 RO..I. +16 355
#note For the second time this tournament, I miss a crucial E(P)EE play in an endgame. But I can't win this game.
