#note many options on this play - NTH short, exchange N (combines great with vowels) and playing long. Usually I would opt for a short play like NTH, but not this time for whatever reason (maybe reading kenji's positions on facebook).

>JD: ENNNOQU G5 QUE.N +16 42
#note play the Q off or not? Q wants me to play something like NONA instead hoping to draw QUEAN or QUERN, but sim is quite close.
>Paul_Holser: ABHIT D8 .ABIT +25 45
>JD: NNOPSSY 13B NOSY +25 67
#note the sim is very close between SONNY, PINYONS and NOSY. N and P have poor synergy even though there are very few Ns in the bag, so SONNY sims slightly ahead.

#note I was going to play WABS at 10B to set up my S, but then decided that the NOPS leave was not really better than ANS. The real difference between them is that the board is very tight and WABS takes away a scoring spot, whereas SWAP creates a nice place to score for Paul - WABS wins the sim by 3.

#note I saw FISTIC but chickened out of it thinking it was CSW. Big error.

>JD: DFHIOVZ B1 FOH +25 215
#note I wanted to save the Z for B6. Q cleverly suggests SHIV at 2C which makes it way more likely that I can draw FEZ at B4 - awesome play that I missed.

>JD: DILOTVZ A1 OD +27 242
#note if I'm trying to hit ZA I really should be turning over more tiles, although I guess it isn't urgent since I'm ahead by a good amount. Abandoning the Z fish and playing GLITZ is also competitive.

#note I wanted to turn over tiles, and this has the bonus of blocking bingos on column I. Another choice would be DOITED at the same spot, or DIDO at O2.

#note I have to block here, but there are no other bingos to be scared of given the weird pool.
