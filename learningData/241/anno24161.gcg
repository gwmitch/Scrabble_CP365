#note i like DITZ after his fish as it's not that easy to bingo through a Z... the equity move here by far is N5 OBI, but that's giving him free points.

#note he was lowish on time and i didn't immediately see an overlap so i threw this down. it's a pretty bad mistake, though. i might as well play BAZOO. -27  (or, ZOA if i want to be defensive!)
