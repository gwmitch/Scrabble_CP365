#note HELP!
Q likes FUND 3L by a lot over my play.  For merely five more ponts, this feels -way- too aggressive to me, even with a blank in  hand.

#note Guy played this, pulled it back out of QI fear, but didn't happen to spot SIGANID and said he chickened out on LADINGS.
Q actually only puts his play at 7% less to win than the safer plays.

#note best for equity, but only INSTATE 14I is 90% to win.   I didn't feel like slotting anything in triple lane.   I'm giving up slots for eights here, but I'm spending the case S at least.
