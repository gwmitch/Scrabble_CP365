#note Quackle prefers 8H VOG but I hate opening with a V given how it can lead to closed boards.
>Menachem_Rosenberg: ETU G8 .UTE +12 12
>David_Turissini: EGMMNVV H5 VEN.M +14 36
#note Quackle likes xch GMVV followed by a ton of exchange permutations over my play.  I thought I'd be able to play through the bad rack and lucked out.

#note I lucked out to be able to play through the early bad racks to reach this bingo.
>Menachem_Rosenberg: EH J13 EH +19 60
>David_Turissini: AADEEGQ F4 QA.D +14 143
#note 5E AGA(V)E  I think I'm too conditioned to dump the Q early.

>David_Turissini: ?ADEEGY B6 .EGADYnE +82 225
#note I think this is my best play ever.  It's the only playable bingo.

>David_Turissini: AABEPTT D8 TAB +20 366
#note Quackle likes J9  ABA and D8  BAP which I dismissed because of the double Ts.  I guess they're not a concern here?

>David_Turissini: AIOOPRT N2 A.IT +16 414
#note I thought this was a clever play since it blocks the three remaining bingo lanes.  Quackle is totally ona different page and prefers 2H  RIP which opens a lane to the TWS.  Why?
>Menachem_Rosenberg: ABDR B1 DRAB +23 303

#note I wish I knew 1A O(D)OgRAPH.  Otherwise, 2E cARHOP and bARHOP block ADORN forcing 9K  (L)ORAN for less points.
