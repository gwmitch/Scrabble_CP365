#note AIOLI K3 is the right play. im having a lot of trouble picking good plays. note that my OI is better than the one that scores 2 more, though. -10

#note crazy that i can't use that Y. it's worth keeping the J here to try to outscore her, but things are looking very grim.

>cesar: IJOPSVW A1 OP +35 277
#note my reasoning is to try to take the easy spot. it's easy for her to play OD or ID or something like that here. i also don't want to lose my case S. but the leave and score are just too much for WISPY. i have to take it, i think. ugh. -9

#note i played badly at the beginning. i realize now why it's so hard for me to come back after a few losses. no matter how much better i take bad records now, it's really hard not to tilt internally, and my first two moves were extremely tilty. also missing JIVEY, etc. but at least i broke the loss streak. 3-6 now.
