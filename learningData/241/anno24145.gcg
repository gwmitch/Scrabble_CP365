#note could play OKEH, but I'm guaranteed to play the Hs off next turn for good points

#note TORT ever so slightly preferable (no 2x2 after fish)

>Kristian_Dietz: JLR B6 J.RL +27 170
>JD: DIILNVX 4J .IVIL +20 270
#note hardest play of the game, but definitely right once found - sets up X beautifully and he may wind up trying CIVILS
>Kristian_Dietz: DENOOSW O4 SWOONED +98 268
>Kristian_Dietz: DENOOSW --  -98 170
>JD: ADENRUX 11D EX +38 308
#note worth it to block SWOONED? I decided yes even though my play gives him a nice scoring play. A sim suggests that after RELAX I score about 7 points per turn more, and DOW after EX would keep a strong leave, but still worthwhile - after RELAX, 56-76+42=22 net versus 38-32+34=40 net after EX.
>Kristian_Dietz: DENOOSW 12B ENDOW +36 206
>JD: ABDMNRU K3 M.B +26 334
#note first sizable mistake of tourney - EARBUD scores nicely and dumps bad letters.
>Kristian_Dietz: DOU 13A UDO +15 221
#note DUO would play for 5 more and still set up a decent lane
>JD: ADINORU L2 NO.A +17 351
#note again missing a nice scoring play from the E - ENDURO much better.
>Kristian_Dietz: ACP 2F CA. +10 231
>JD: DEIPRRU N1 PUR.ED +26 377
#note could also sacrifice a few points and play PULER (harder to overlap the R) but there are enough lanes on the board that PURLED should be worth it.
>Kristian_Dietz: NY 1A ..NY +20 251
>JD: FIINQRY -  +0 377
#note didn't write this play down - low on time and had drawn the Q. My rack was probably something like FIINQRY given what he wound up with.
>Kristian_Dietz: ?EGNSTU 14C ToNGUES +64 315
>JD: ABGIRST H13 B.G +18 395
#note I wanted to find an endgame sequence that would block all his Q spots, but under time pressure didn't find one good enough. Actually this ends up being only 10 worse than optimal - best play is TRIG at G15 setting up ABS niftily at 13F.
