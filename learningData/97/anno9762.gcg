>James: DENORTY 8H DORTY +26 26
#note I missed YONDER 8D. A mistake on my part, but slight - the EN leave is still strong to offset the fact that I score 2 less and put an O next to a DLS. 
>Geoff: AHIR L4 HAIR. +22 22
>James: CELNNST K3 CENT +23 49
#note I like this better than CLAN 5J, which Quackle favors a touch more for the leave almost definitely. I prefer the better S-hook spot, though it can also be problematic (leading to an ASCENT counter-hook). 
>Geoff: AT J8 .AT +5 27
#note I'm not sure what to make of plays like this versus players like Geoff. I've played him so little but in this game you will see a few times when he does exactly this (play off two decent tiles for no points). I am not sure if it's because he likes to fish or because he really had not much else to do. It's strange because AT 7H would score more and open up in so many more directions. 

When you start reading your opponent's moves, sometimes they do confuse you because you're not sure why they are making moves in the manner they are.  
>James: AEELNRS 11F LEANERS +68 117
#note I am not sure why I didn't play 11D, but I played this one. It's better than 2E (next to triple) and 11I (S in bingo lane) at least...? Actually, that makes even less sense - given that he is almost definitely fishing with great bingo tiles, this is perhaps the worst idea since he could have an -ING bingo to hook on at E5, making GLEANERS. 
>Geoff: AEINRTU H1 URINATE. +80 107
>James: AAELRUW H11 .WARE +36 153
#note Best. 
>Geoff: GLOW E11 GLOW +34 141
>James: AFFIKTU G3 KUFI +36 189
#note Quackle considers KUFI a tossup as best move with SKIFF L11, which should've been worth some consideration (though I missed SKIFF), but having the F would've made this harder to resist since I had a ready-made F6 play if I was lucky. 
>Geoff: AIMU 13B MIA.U +14 155
>James: ADFGGIT F6 FIG +29 218
#note Best - though it's a statistical tie with FAG F6 by Quackle's estimation, the fact there are 4 Is unseen compared to 2 As makes this easier for me to consider. 
>Geoff: UY B11 YU. +8 163
#note I am not sure what the point of this play was actually. They're definitely bad tiles together, YU, but this actually blocks up some bingo lanes and he's the one who's down. Also, the U isn't that bad... maybe OY I8 would be worth it for the 10 more points? 
>James: ADDEGJT C7 GADJE +23 241
#note A bit of a whiff - ADJUDGE or JUDGED 1G actually looks best to me though I think I must've missed it at the time. GADJE is a pretty word but I don't really trust Quackle's evaluation. I should've probably taken YUM as a sign he had 5 other great tiles again, though. 
>Geoff: ?BEENOR A5 ENROBEd +79 242
>James: DEMOOTV 1G O.TMOVED +68 309
#note Lucky me - everytime I make a misread or a mistake, I draw a bingo to bail me out. 
>Geoff: OPX D6 POX +40 282
>James: EEHIIST 12L HI +20 329
#note The right tiles to play, though I should've played HIE 12L if I was going to play there. However, I only noticed afterwards WHIR 14E (like, 10 seconds after I hit the clock), which was exactly what I was looking for, as it would help to block one of the more problematic bingo lanes and score better. 

WHIRE is the runaway, as is WHERE 14E because it helps block up the bingo lanes along the bottom too. Somehow, HI doesn't do that badly but it was a big mistake on my part. 
>Geoff: BCEIOSV -BCEI +0 282
>James: EEISSTZ N10 ZESTS +74 403
#note If I was going for spread, SOZINE I7 would be my choice (though I missed THAT completely and didn't see it until Quackle pointed it out to me), but ZESTS was the best way to try and shut Geoff out of the game completely. 
>Geoff: AE 10E AE +17 299
>James: DEIIQSV N1 .EV +14 417
#note I think given the last times Geoff played a bingo, it was a decent assumption he had another bingo in the works. That being said, I missed my best play by a long shot in trying to fish for QADIS 14J. VIED B2 sets up my QI 1A perfectly, alllowing me to outrun anything, really. 
>Geoff: CLO B3 COL +7 306
>James: DIINPQS 6K ..PI +8 425
#note Just to block up BIZONAL G5. 
>Geoff: ?ABILNO O7 OBIA +29 335
