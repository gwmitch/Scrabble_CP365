#note Too bad there was no decent way Conrad could give me RE or DE. I'd have had REFLECTOR or DEFLECTOR! 

As it is, I wasn't sure what to play here. FORE was picked because it was most likely for Conrad to play through that, and it scored best. FOIL 7G is a good idea for the leave and Quackle likes it most, too. CROFT 4H, FET 7C... also possible choices. But it does notably favor FOIL.

#note I drew a T with this and was thinking I had COLLATION! Then realized I had 10 letters somehow without a place that had 3 letters on the board. So Conrad finds the T and throws it back and when I say I had a 10, he counters with "Okay James, play your 9 then". And I found it with his prodding! 

Lucky me.

#note Conrad challenged. He said he had a bad set of tiles so he couldn't really do much of anything as it was. 
>James: AEJOSSU L1 J.AO +38 195
#note After that challenge, it's possible he was holding out for me to play so he could slap down a 7 but I doubt it, since he'd be likely down by way too much. So I played for 38. Quackle also likes JOULE 6F, likely because I have the two esses. 

Another factor in playing this is that the challenge lets me know he didn't have something major. If he did, I likely wouldn't have seen him challenge since I have too many places to play bingos otherwise.

#note I missed WEASONS 5E! Oh well, it was really hard to lose after HAW anyway. I also set up my esses.
