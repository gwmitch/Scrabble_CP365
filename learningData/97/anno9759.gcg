>James: AADGORX 8D GARDA +18 18
#note GOX 8G is favored, but I thought playing GARDA was a better idea because GARDAI could lead to a XI play at the worst... and I have an OX placement parallel at the worst. 
>Chris: IORU D8 .UIRO +12 12
>James: AEGIOPX I7 PIX +31 49
#note Quackle likes EXPO E11, probably because it scores most and leaves a decent AGI. I got blinded by the cuteness of my first play, I think. 
>Chris: IO J6 OI +8 20
#note Chris never plays these unless he really can't do anything else that scores 25+ with a great hand. He must have a great hand, then. 
>James: AEFGOOT F1 FOOTGEA. +66 115
#note Best. 
>Chris: ?EIILRT 1F .LInTIER +83 103
>James: DEFILWY E10 FEW +32 147
#note I saw WIFELY D1 but somehow missed the other K4 spot...  It, then WIFEY K4 and then FEW, are the best spots. 
>Chris: CDEENNU 3D EN.UNCED +65 168
#note After this, Chris immediately slapped his forehead. However... 
>James: ABGILNY M1 .ANGIBLY +80 227
>James: ABGILNY --  -80 147
#note I have no Ds or Rs to take advantage of it and better yet, I play a phony! 
>Chris: ABEHR C3 REHAB +50 218
>James: ABGILNY B4 BAY +38 185
#note Best, but wow, what a way to go. 
>Chris: EEMPRSU A5 PRESUME +97 315
#note Ouch. Oddly enough, PRESUME K5 is more at 101. 
>James: EGILNOS K5 LINGOES +89 274
#note LEGIONS K5 is 1 more point. 
>Chris: AJY C12 JAY +39 354
>James: AACIINS L4 AI +6 280
#note I thought of CASINA 15A though CASINA isn't good, but didn't think of CASINI which is! so instead I end up getting desperate in another way to maybe get a bingo since I can't see a good scoring play with a good leave (NISI and CASA 15A leave AAC and IIN, respectively)ai

>Chris: EMW J10 MEW +26 380
>James: ACEHINS 15A CASH +53 333
#note Best. I need to score to get into this game. 
>Chris: TV D2 V.T +22 402
>James: EEIIKNQ M3 QI +24 357
#note After this, I'm pretty sure I've lost. 
>Chris: DV 6E D.V +7 409
#note This *can't* be good. 
>James: EEIKNNU 14B K.E +37 394
>Chris: ?NORSTT N3 iNTORTS +71 480
>James: EINNTUZ -  +0 394
#note I challenged this... somehow I wasn't 100% but as it is, he would win if it was regardless of what I'd do. And I never really care about spread in a tournament. 

And yes, I am dumb for questioning it.
