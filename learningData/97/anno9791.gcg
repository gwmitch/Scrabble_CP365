>Chris_Cree: AAITW 8H AWAIT +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: BGIKLSY J7 B.LKY +24 24
#note Don't know that I like Quackle's choices here.  Yes, the GIS leave sucks, but I don't see why I should ditch the S to keep GLY for all of one more scoreboard point.  Q prefers M6 BISK for 25 by a point for some reason.
>Chris_Cree: IRTZ 7E RITZ +25 43
>Jim_Burlant: FGGINRS F6 F.G +15 39
#note Spent a while on this turn debating whether to play this or front hook RITZ and play FRIG.  Q agrees with this choice.   (AWAIT)ING 8H scores 36 and is a 4-point dog.  D7 plays sim 7 points down on this.
>Chris_Cree: FOPR D4 PROF +35 78
>Jim_Burlant: EGHINRS M2 HINGERS +83 122
#note Best bingo.  Other options include 10F GHER(K)INS, 4C S(P)HERING.
>Chris_Cree: ?ACEEOT -  +0 78
#note Lost challenge.  This is Chris's actual rack.  
>Jim_Burlant: ILNRUUV 5K VU. +14 136
#note What the hell is it with my post-bingo racks today?  This is the bronze medalist, though that's more of a reflection of how few good choices I have.  The 2-ply sim likes  L2 ULU, which seems reckless to set up an S hook on row 1 for only 17 with SSS?? unseen.
>Chris_Cree: ?ACEEOT 9A ACETOsE +67 145
#note Best bingo for Chris.  Other bingo options for him are 4B COPEMATE and APOTHECE.
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNRU A8 E.U +9 145
#note I didn't look for plays that broke up this otherwise promising rack, and I very seriously considered HUE 2M, which percolates to the top of the sim.  I figured that as long as he didn't land an H, there was no need to open up another triple.  Q says 2M HUE was/is the play.  Of note:  D4 (PROF)I(T)EER scores 30.
>Chris_Cree: AHNRU B5 RAUN.H +36 181
#note If you needed an omen of the kind of game this was going to be for me, this was it.  He drew the only remaining F right after he played RITZ, and now that I've given him an H spot, he's drawn an H that very turn.  What are the odds?
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNRW A1 DWINE +32 177
#note For some reason I could have sworn that I'd lost a turn playing WHINGER a while back, so I was convinced that the W front hook was/is no good.  Obviously, a row 1 play was the ticket, with LWEI 1L  winning the sim.  This is the best option available that doesn't front-hook HINGERS.
>Chris_Cree: AQT L1 QAT +29 210
>Jim_Burlant: AEIILRV N1 VIE +27 204
#note With 6 E's unseen, I wasn't too worried about burning my E.  Q agrees - this is best, winning not quite 39%.  
>Chris_Cree: INO K10 ION +22 232
>Jim_Burlant: ACILLNR D9 .ILL +8 212
#note Now my downward spiral begins.  I whiffed on  L11 NARIC and there really are no good options otherwise.  The sim runner up is 2A WILL; I felt that I needed to open up some through lines in the southwest.  This isn't one of the kibbitzer options, but it sims decently.
>Chris_Cree: BGO L11 BOG +24 256
>Jim_Burlant: ACEILNR 11D .AC +10 222
#note Yet another nogo.  But unlike the VIRELAI rack, I had no idea what to do.  Q likes O3 RENAIL, but that strikes me as breaking up that rack way too cheaply.  For 30 or 35, sure, but only 25?  Regardless, this is weak.
>Chris_Cree: EJSST 14J JESTS +63 319
>Jim_Burlant: EILMNOR 15G LIMO +27 249
#note Q prefers LION 15H, but in reality it's just style preference - any of the row 15 plays sim within 2 points of 15G LEMON, the sim winner.
>Chris_Cree: X 6M .X +25 344
>Jim_Burlant: EEEMNPR E3 PEE +18 267
#note q prefers 2A WEEPER, presumably both for maximizing score (the only option that scores more than 20 points) and for turnover to get at the blank.  Q thinks this is a mid-pack play.
>Chris_Cree: EU 7M .UE +12 356
>Jim_Burlant: DEMNRRT O7 .MEND +24 291
#note Didn't think I really had much choice here.  Q thinks I should just play TREND(S) N9, as that ostensibly wins 27%.  This play wins 5.  Regardless, given his next rack, they all win 0.
