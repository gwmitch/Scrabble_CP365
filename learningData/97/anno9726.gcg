#note I'm quite surprised here how much adding a consonant helps QU?. without the blank I'm not sure that it does unless there are lots of vowels to play through. however, here quackle prefers KOR or DORK.

#note definitely one of the more interesting plays of the game. I saw TELECOM but I was pretty hesitant to leave the spot at the bottom-left open. TONEY doesn't suggest that she has a play there necessarily, but there's a huge degree of volatilty if I leave it open for a turn. I decided to play it safe, which doesn't quite win the sim but comes very close.

#note hey, my rack was supposed to get better, not worse! I actually saw ENNUI and passed it up. with a few lanes open it didn't seem like a great idea to cripple my rack just to get up by 58. that said, she can now catch up with me without bingoing potentially.

#note this is a little bit of a goofy play, but it turns over tiles and scores with a blank in the bag, and takes out the D for bonus points. it does ok in a 2-ply or 4-ply sim. plays like INIA, INANE or ANI do best but this is at least in the ballpark.

#note this is her actual rack, which means that I'm supposed to be dead. but she chickened out of fruitage.
>jd: AEEHIIW N14 WE +22 359
#note well, I kinda had to do that.
