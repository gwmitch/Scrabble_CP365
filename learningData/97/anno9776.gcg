#note perfect example of my 'kamikaze' play. i have a chance to try to destroy the board with a less open play like 15E TOTE. in a way though, i always tend to see plays like this as leaving it MORE up to chance. if i do TOTE, then suddenly whoever gets a big S play in the O column becomes important. or an S and then an -ED/-ER bingo on row 12... and so forth. i don't like shutting down lanes because then the remaining lanes become too valuable. i don't really know if that makes sense (probably not). in any case, TOTE does sim best by a little bit.

#note again, i've committed this game to be a wide-open game, and i can't go back on that now. FEDORA will have to do. somehow, i think 90% chance of winning seems a bit high. or i am underestimating it.

#note sheesh, now i'm probably in trouble. still, i'm more comfortable playing on this board than i would be if i'd played TOTE. that would have been low-scoring plays, lots of thinking every move to try to figure out how to block and score, and so forth. no no no. not for me. anyway, i missed BERYL :/ (-7)

#note unfortunately i could not talk myself into playing BELLINGS and sealing this game. i maybe picked the second best thing, but i have no idea. although i give him more letters to work with, i felt like it would also make his bingos be more 'specific'. in any case, turns out i was wrong, there are more bingos for him after YELLING. (-22)
>ben: ?AEIIRV 14M AVE +14 303
>cesar: AABIKLS D2 KI.LBASA +65 397
#note i was actually hoping he'd bingo the turn before somewhere in lanes C-E, so that i could play 2H BAIL and go out with ASK/KBAR or 13E ASK (if of course he didn't have an out.. ugh). now i have this almost-BALALAIKAS-rack and he has bingos in both spots with half the pool. after a couple minutes, it dawns upon me that i have KIELBASA. this was during his turn when he played AVE. unfortunately, i have no idea if it's good or if i'm just misspelling KIELBASI or confusing it with KOHLBASI (which is not a word) and so forth. once he played AVE i had to work up the courage to play it. i didn't want to have a 50% chance of losing. no sir. (actually, i didn't even see EMERITAE/EMEERATE, only ELATERIN/ENTAILER in both spots, and didn't want the 12.5% chance of losing! so i really needed to be really sure of my play)
