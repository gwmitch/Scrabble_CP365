>Bill: ACGIKOO H6 GOOK +18 18
>Opponent: ABF G5 FAB +21 21
#note Hm, didn't think about it at the time, but this is probably a Z setup. It scores the same at I8.
>Bill: ACCDEIR F4 CEDAR +31 49
#note I picked this over CRIED, CARED, etc. for defense.
>Opponent: AEEPR 8A REAPE. +33 54
>Bill: AABCIMN I8 MANIAC +25 74
#note AMBIANCE. Crap. Taking out the bingo, I like this to keep the board open, plus I clearly can't be trusted to find bingos from an ACIN or ACIMN stem (-59).
>Opponent: AOZ 7B AZO +49 103
#note See? Z setup. After AMBIANCE he would've had at least ZOA for 77, so that knocks out 28 of the 59 I tossed away.
>Bill: ABITTUV -ABITTUV +0 74
#note Terrible tilt exchange. I really didn't want to play through a V, but it's not like I should be in Must Bingo Now mode. J9 BUT is a perfectly fine play (-19.5).
>Opponent: JNX 11H J.NX +36 139
>Bill: DEHINPT 9C PED +34 108
#note ZAPTIEH 48!! I do know it, but it was nowhere on my radar here. I did this over PEH to hold the H for scoring plays from the C or dumping at B6.
>Opponent: OW 6A OW +27 166
>Bill: HILNTTV -HILNTTV +0 108
#note Too many duplicates unseen for me to make a smaller exchange or play something like NTH or THIEF.

>Opponent: EEILV A8 .ELIVE +13 223
>Bill: AEEGLST 14C LEGATES +71 226
#note I'm clearly not on top of all the anagrams in this rack. SEGETAL scores 80. TELEGAS is another one I would've been unsure of, but I'm sure I could've found GELATES and EAGLETS, so I should've engaged with my brain a little instead of playing this without much thought, because this is an interesting choice (if you don't know SEGETAL). This allows RELIVED/DELEGATES for an easy 33, plus two TWS hotspots. I did notice the extension possibility, but I just figured that there would be something for each of us, so I shouldn't give up four points with the J2 placement. EAGLETS and GELATES are less volatile here, and GELATES at J2 is only two points fewer and doesn't give much back, but I would guess that he'd then have a good play/more points for his bingo hooking RELIVE. In the end, I think I like my play (after SEGETAL, of course), but I should've taken more time on it.

#note He spent a while on this. I assume he was debating making a play on the K column. Whatever his reason was for not doing so (maybe he couldn't reach the DWS, or wanted to score 20 and keep an S? combo, or didn't want to turn over more than two with the Q lurking), it would've forced a lot more specificity on me (especially since he was probably holding the case E and/or A), possibly required my bingo to stray into the triple lane, and probably would've prevented a bingo given my actual rack. I'm not criticizing, though: playing on the K column could lead to disaster for him if I'm still able to bingo and he draws the Q. I think FIEF is probably good: he's guessing I'll probably bingo, but hoping he'll bingo back or have an easy 32 if he draws the Q. It does make the Q more of a wild card down the stretch, but if he's holding the last A, he knows he's the only one who can make a play with the Q at 4A without using a blank.

>Opponent: ?AEIRSU 4H URA.ItES +68 367
#note Darn. Game over ;)
>Bill: INOTTTU 4A UNTO +20 357
#note Technically, INTO is four points better, leading to a ten point loss after 3A QI, H1 TUTU. This play gives him a chance to do something silly.
>Opponent: DDINQS O2 QI. +12 379
>Bill: ITT 5J T.T +7 364
>Opponent: DDNS A8 ......NS +33 412
>Opponent: DDNS --  -33 379
#note Noonan!
>Bill: I C3 I. +4 368
#note 10A LI for eight. I had seconds left after searching for an outplay the previous turn, and knew I just needed four. This is a perfect example of why I don't like to just accept an obvious losing sequence to preserve spread points.
