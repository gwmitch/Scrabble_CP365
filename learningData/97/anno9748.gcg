>James: ?ALNNNR -LNN +0 0
#note An exchange that holds a decent leave (?, AN?, ALN or ARN?, etc) is best. It's not worth trying to play through because 6 points is not worth throwing away your only vowel for.
>James_P: BLNTU 8D BLUNT +20 20
>James: ?AABNRS H5 BAR.iSAN +60 60
#note I missed SANDBAR I8 but worse, TANBARKS H8. 
>James_P: GQU 6F QU.G +34 54
>James: INOPTYZ 10H .IZY +36 96
#note It's a tossup between this, ZLOTY E7 and UNZIP F8 at the top. 
>James_P: EIMR 6F ....MIRE +26 80
>James: FNOOPTU 5K POOF +30 126
#note UPON 5J is slightly ahead of POOF, which is ahead of TOFU 5K. I was looking for a way to stop QUAGMIRED from potentially hurting a lot, but POOF also opens up its own problem plays (POOFY and POOFS). UPON doesn't. 
>James_P: ANW K10 .AWN +20 100
#note I'm not sure why not AWN 11K. 
>James: DIINNTU D8 .INDI +16 142
#note Slightly ahead of UNBID D6 (best leave) for best play. 
>James_P: DEG L4 G..ED +18 118
>James: EHJNRTU 10B JU. +26 168
#note Best - the score is best, dumps the J and leaves a fairly okay leave (even without another vowel, playing off 3 consonants and 1 vowel is quite possible). 
>James_P: CMPR 12B CR.MP +11 129
>James: EHINORT 12K .ORTH +30 198
#note Quackle likes HO L11 more. I can't really disagree because EINRT isn't a bad leave. The problem is that I'm not likely to see any great openings. As such, I just went for more points and to hopefully draw an S or Y for the POOF spot. 
>James_P: AORVY O1 OVARY +49 178
>James: AEEIKNN O12 .IKE +33 231
#note The other useful point of WORTH is that even if that spot up top is taken, I still get another place to play. Quackle suggests HAKE O12 more, by a non-negligible amount... I'm not sure why? 
>James_P: X 9C X. +34 212
>James: ?AENNSW 14F WANNESs +80 311
#note Quackle values non-bingo plays, like DAWN 8L, or SEWN A12, to be equal to the bingo. It can't be faulted in some ways because the bingo allows easy playback for the most part, and if the S-play at A12 comes for James Porter... then we're about even again if I have a terrible set of tiles. That, or James could just bingo... which is why WANNESS 14E may be worth it, because it makes it far harder even though it's 7 less. 
>James_P: EELT 15E TELE +25 237
>James: DEEIIOO 8J IO.IDE +24 335
#note Best. 
>James_P: HIST A12 SHIT +37 274
>James: AEGORSV 2M VA. +18 353
#note I don't actually know what James could do to bingo ending in an O or V, so maybe VAV isn't useful yet. But I liked it. 
>James_P: EE E11 E.E +16 290
#note At this point, I think it's time to punt with EVE M1 and pray I have nothing good or have gotten ultimately overconfident. 
>James: AEGLORS N2 .LE.S +37 390
#note And with this, I've pretty much won.
