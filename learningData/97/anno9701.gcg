#note a couple of cool moves here. 7I LOUPEN is sweet but feels too defensive. H1 UNLED is probably what i should have played based on leave alone, but it does not seem wise to leave an obvious high scoring spot open now. the three moves sim very closely.

#note the leave and positioning for J2 JOBS is much better. i was too happy to dump some letters that i didn't look closely enough. (-6.5)

#note quackle really likes playing on row 5. i think my play blocks up the board too much? even though i have the T hook? i'm actually not sure. (-3)
