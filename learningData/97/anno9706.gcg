#note ahhhh I want a bingo. I liked the idea behind my play a lot. I need a lane and vicky will be blocking 14 and 15 next turn, almost for sure. but maybe I give up too many good letters or something. it is disconcerting how infrequently I bingo after TRIP on the sim. perhaps setting up that lane is just bad news. I really don't know.

#note it ain't looking so good. I guess I was hopping to draw a blank for some W_TCHES bingo. quackle's suggestion of CELOTEX actually looks pretty good to me.
