>Claudia: GUV 8G VUG +14 14
>James: ELNOPTY 9H POLY +18 18
#note This is at the top with PONY 9H. However, I like POLY because she may not see the P hook and doubt that POLY takes an S. 
>Claudia: AE 10J AE +13 27
>James: EMNORRT 11H MORT +27 45
#note I missed MONEYER K5, the runaway best. This is also behind MORN 11H, which is second best. ERT is a better overall leave than ENR. 
>Claudia: ?EIX H11 .IXEd +42 69
>James: EFFNORR 13C FORFE. +40 85
#note This was held and wasn't challenged. It's good in Collins, which figures since it's not something I've seen outside of 17th centure English poetry (but I actually thought was good). Quackle proposes other plays like OFFERER 14E otherwise. I think half of why I played this was because I couldn't see anything remotely as nice and thought that perhaps I'd something from her challenging. 
>Claudia: WW D12 W.W +18 87
>James: BDKNORT G12 K.NO +17 102
#note Quackle prefers INK 12H, which I can see why (holds the one vowel) but I thought to play KENO or KEN G12 because the YETT spot could get me out of some trouble if I found myself needing to play off more tiles. Quackle also favors KEN over KENO. 
>Claudia: IN 12K IN +11 98
>James: BDQRSTU 13K SUQ +34 136
#note Best. BUDS or BURST 15A are also worth thinking about but I really wanted to just play off the Q and get on with the game. 
>Claudia: ABDEGIT 14L BIT +26 124
>James: ABDDRTY O12 ARTY +30 166
#note Best. 
>Claudia: ?CDEEIL N6 DECIbEL +65 189
>James: ABDDENR O1 BRANDED +92 258
#note Best. 
>Claudia: EGHHI E8 HIGHE. +31 220
#note I'm not sure why she didn't play HIGHER at 2J for 42. Maybe she was afraid of me countering with high scores but at this point, she's the one in need of luck since she has to catch up. 
>James: ILMNRSV 15A VIMS +41 299
#note Best. 
>Claudia: ET 14B TE. +24 244
>James: AEJLNRZ 10B JAN.LE +32 331
#note Best. 
>Claudia: AEEORSU -AEEO +0 244
>James: EINOPRZ D4 PRIZE +40 371
#note Chickened out of PRIZER 2J, but this was good enough for me. I'm pretty much guaranteed a win now. 
>Claudia: EORU C2 ROUE +14 258
>James: AADINOT 4H ADNATIO. +70 441
#note Best. 
>Claudia: O B10 .O +9 267
>James: ACILNSU 2H CISLUNA. +74 515
#note And lucky ending to conclude the game. 
>James:  (AAEGOST) +16 531
