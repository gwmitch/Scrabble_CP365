>James: BDEOOVW 8D VOWED +32 32
#note Best. The 8 extra points for having a V on the DLS instead of moving the play one to the right far offsets the consideration of a return play on G7 or G9. 
>Bruce: ARTZ C6 TZAR +37 37
>James: BEIIOQT 7F OBIT +25 57
#note It's about a tie between this, OBI 7F, and QI D5 and B5. QI gets rid of the Q and B5 gives more points, but worse defence. BOITE 7G is also worth consideration. 
>Bruce: APR 6C .RAP +26 63
>James: EEHINQS 5D EH +22 79
#note This is very close with QIS 10A and B4. I'm a little leery of QIS 10A because it sets up a race for a U, and I'm not sure B4 is worth the points for now (to lose the S)
>Bruce: ?EGILMP -?EG +0 63
>James: DEINQSV -QV +0 79
#note Quackle likes QIS 4B far more, which makes sense (as it leaves less to fate), but I felt good about trying to go for a bingo with DEINS. An exchange of 3 infers a so-so rack leave but likely nothing high-scoring has been held, so I'm thinking that aside from a bingo I am not going to see too much of a threat from a score. 

Also of consideration is VENDER D1. 
>Bruce: DEFS 4A FEDS +30 93
>James: CDEEINS A4 .INED +27 106
#note Quackle likes FENCE A4 most for the points, which I can't argue with, but I like FINED because of the better leave. Of course, IS is not a bad leave on its own, either, but I was thinking of drawing for CONFINED A1 in case things didn't go well. 
>Bruce: ALNW 6H LAWN +21 114
>James: ?AACESX B9 EXACtAS +114 220
#note Best. 
>Bruce: HO A14 HO +26 140
>James: CNOOPRU A1 CON..... +42 262
#note And look what I draw. It's at the top with POUR, COUPON, and COUP 5I, but I liked the points. It forces Bruce to really go for bingos fast given his current deficit.
>Bruce: ?GKMOSV 5K OM +12 152
>James: AFLOPRU 4J AFOUL +30 292
#note I liked AFOUL over other plays because it stopped S-hooks. It sims at the top with FOU/FOUL, etc as 4K plays. 
>Bruce: EGR E8 .GRE +10 162
>James: ANOPQRS I5 Q.. +12 304
#note TRANQ 13B looks like a good alternative but I decided to fish for a bingo. 
>Bruce: I C3 I. +6 168
>James: AINOPRS 9G SOPRANI +75 379
#note Best. 
>Bruce: AEEIRST N1 EAR.IEST +70 238
>James: IILMTUU O1 MI +26 405
#note I missed MILIEU 1J, which is by far the best. 
>Bruce: BEK K8 B.KE +20 258
>James: EIJLTUU 8K .UT.E +29 434
#note And I've pretty much won.
