>Wayne: ADT 8G TAD +8 8
>James: AEKNTVW 9E KNAWE +26 26
#note I was expecting this to not be favored by Quackle, but it's not doing badly. WAKEN 7F is favored but I thought this might get a challenge, too. 
>Wayne: ALOV 10F OVAL +29 37
>James: AANTVWZ 11D VAW +24 50
#note Best, though TAV 11I is not bad either (as I have the W still). 
>Wayne: IM D11 .IM +16 53
>James: AABNTUZ C12 TABU +22 72
#note Quackle slightly favors NUMBAT 13B, then TABU/TABUN 11I, then this. I can't really blame them; I chickened out of DELT (new word that I blanked on) and missed NUMBAT. NUMBAT dumps the B and sets up a decent leave of AZ. 
>Wayne: PP 15B P.P +10 63
>James: ADEGGNZ B13 GA. +26 98
#note Best. 
>Wayne: EFN 11I FEN +20 83
>James: DDEGMNZ 12J MEND +20 118
#note Best. 
>Wayne: ?AEINRT N9 RETsINA +73 156
>James: CDEGIOZ O5 COZIED +59 177
#note I missed ZODIAC 15J, though I spent time looking too. Sigh. A bad miss. This is second, by a large margin between it and first, and third. 
>Wayne: CHR 15L CH.R +36 192
>James: ?EGINSU J2 GUINEaS +68 245
#note Best, with GUNNIES at the same spot. GUNNIES is perhaps better because it leaves two Ns out, meaning there's not so much diversity in terms of letters to play through. 
>Wayne: EX K5 EX +31 223
>James: ILNORRT A10 LIROT +18 263
#note Quackle recommends TOR I4 and LIROT 4I before my choice. I'm not 100% sure why LIROT; I have the last N meaning the open G favors me slightly. However, for TOR, I suppose being cautious, it will stop Q plays in that quadrant which will allow Wayne to take the lead easily. 
>Wayne: BDLU 4H BU.LD +32 255
>James: AINORRS 2D ROARIN.S +61 324
#note Luckbox me. 
>Wayne: EEY 13H EYE +15 270
#note Not a bad idea - if I don't have the J, maybe he can bingo and play a J off here, or draw the Q up top. 
>James: HIJLOTY 1H HO +32 356
#note That does presuppose that I don't have one of them already, though. Best, since I wanted to be cautious in case I did draw the Q.
