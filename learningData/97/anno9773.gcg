>Donna: ?ABEEVZ 8D ZEBrA +50 50
#note Even though it uses a blank, ZEBrA is best. Donna told me her leave was EV -- I might have simply played ZA.
>Richard_Spence: EEINOTV 7G ENVOI +17 17
#note Quackle likes (B)OVINE F8 18.
>Donna: ?AEOPRV 6A OVERlAP +75 125
#note Using the blank worked after all. However I noticed she missed VAPORi(Z)E D2 92. And now I realized that she accidentally scored herself 67 instead of 75. 
>Richard_Spence: EELNSTY L4 TENSELY +81 98
#note Best play.
>Donna: FOW A5 W.OF +30 155
#note She had an S on her rack; I would've done WO(O)FS for 15 more points.
>Richard_Spence: HLNNUWY 8K N.WLY +35 133
#note This begins a streak of unusually bad tiles. Donna blocks my UNH(O)LY A3 39, so I'm forced to play N(E)WLY 8K 35.
>Donna: ABD 9C BAD +23 178
>Richard_Spence: AHHINOU K3 HUH +30 163
#note Best play, again.
>Donna: GOT 10B TOG +23 201
>Richard_Spence: AADIINO M10 OIDIA +17 180
#note Wow, (L)IANOID. OIDIA was about the same in terms of valuation.
>Donna: CEST 11D SECT +26 227
#note Interesting S play.
>Richard_Spence: AAIKNNU M1 KUNA +19 199
#note Quackle likes (T)ANUKI -- it's awfully dangerous though. I played KUNA M1 19.
>Donna: IT 1M .IT +21 248
>Richard_Spence: AEFIINU 12J FUN.I +18 217
#note This game is UNFAI(R). I played FUN(D)I, which cost me.
>Donna: ADENOST 13E DONATES +67 315
#note Yeah, I'm done. She's had two blanks and I've had junk.
>Richard_Spence: AEEIIIR D1 AIRIE. +14 231
#note Quackle prefers AIRIE(R) to exchanging.
>Donna: CLOT 2A LOT.C +14 329
>Richard_Spence: EGILORR H12 R.GI +18 249
#note LOT(I)C blocked my (A)RGOL or GOR(A)L or whatever. I played R(A)GI because I didn't want opponent to slam a J or Q on H12.
>Donna: ADEGP 14B PAGED +36 365
>Richard_Spence: AELOQRR 15A LAR +15 264
#note I blew this game.
>Donna: EJMRSUX N14 XU +36 401
>Richard_Spence: EEJMOQR O13 REM +37 301
#note Awful endgame rack. I played REM O13 37 because it was slightly better than JO(L)E in terms of spread. Didn't even notice JE(FE). Wow.
>Donna: EIMRS O3 MISER. +12 413
#note This one word describes my entire game.
>Donna:  (EJOQ) +40 453
#note Final score was tallied 445-301 due to the OVERlAP scoring error.
