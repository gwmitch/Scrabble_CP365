>Richard_Spence: AHIINUU -HIIUU +0 0
#note Yeah, Quackle doesn't suggest making *any* play (e.g. HUN, NAH).
>Travis: AIMQRTW -  +0 0
#note Opponent exchanged 3.

>Richard_Spence: ?AAANTW 8F AWA +12 12
#note Easy play. Quackle actually prefers 8H instead of 8F.
>Travis: DU G8 .UD +8 8
#note Already a dead board (especially for S hooks). "We're such experts." - Travis, after a 12-8 score.
>Richard_Spence: ?ADNOTU 7H hANDOUT +60 72
#note hANDOUT is best.
>Travis: ADEITUV L7 .UTVIED +24 32
#note Travis told me his other tile was an A (so ADEITUV). AU(D)ITED would've been a 2x2. 
>Richard_Spence: ABEEGSX O7 SEX +38 110
#note I spent some time on this one before deciding to play SEX O7 38. Quackle actually likes (V)EX, even though it is 9 points fewer.
>Travis: AHO K11 HAO +27 59
#note This is a pretty bad board for bingos ending in -S (WUD, HAO) except for S(HA).
>Richard_Spence: AABEFGL J10 FAG +25 135
#note Best play.
>Travis: LOPRW 6E PROWL +19 78
>Richard_Spence: ABEILYZ 10N BY +27 162
#note Quackle likes ZI(P) E4 28. I like BY 10N 27. I play BY 10N 27.
>Travis: IQ I9 QI +26 104
>Richard_Spence: ADEEILZ 5I AZIDE +33 195
#note I didn't really feel like opening 3x3s or even triples against Travis.
>Travis: BCKOU 5A BUCKO +34 138
>Richard_Spence: EILMOPR C5 .OMPILER +68 263
#note Too bad IMPLORE doesn't play. I have to risk the dangerous S- hook.
>Travis: EERSV 13C SEVER +48 186
#note Travis told me after the game he missed (B)EREAVES.
>Richard_Spence: ELLSTTY H12 YELL +42 305
#note YELL is best, and better than YETT. If Travis had played (B)EREAVES I would've replied with STYLET/COMPILERS for 50.
>Travis: EEJ J2 JEE. +36 222
>Richard_Spence: AFHOSTT A5 .OTH +27 332
#note Wasn't 100% sure on TO(P)H. Should've played it.
>Travis: ACGIIIN 2G GAI.IN +14 236
#note Travis told me his leave after GAI(J)IN was IC. With an ACGIIIN rack, Quackle says IC(K) D3 18 is best. GAI(J)IN is just too dangerous.
>Richard_Spence: ?AFOSTT 1G AFT +38 370
#note I was only 80% sure of FA(L)SETTO, but AFT is better anyway. Plus it opens another bingo line.
>Travis: CEIMNRS 3A MINCERS +79 315
>Richard_Spence: ?AENOST 15H .AcTONES +74 444
#note LAcTONES is apparently the only bingo hitting a TWS.
>Travis: EGINNOR 1L OGRE +21 336
#note (BOTH)ERING would've been cute.
>Richard_Spence: IRT N12 RIT. +8 452
>Richard_Spence:  (INN) +6 458
