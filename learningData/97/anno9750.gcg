>Siri: DENOT 8H NOTED +16 16
>James: AGGIUWY 7G GUY +24 24
#note Both placements of GUY are best. 
>Siri: AIQ L5 QAI. +14 30
>James: AGINWXZ 6F ZAG +40 64
#note Quackle slightly favors WAX 9I but I thought if I play this first, I play the harder to play Z first... Though maybe I should've thought of the leave (INWX v GINZ). 
>Siri: EEFINOR 6J PR.VO +18 48
>Siri: EEFINOR --  -18 30
#note Oh Siri. 
>James: AILNVWX 9I WAX +41 105
#note That bit of worrying was for naught, I guess. Best. 
>Siri: OPRV 6K P.RVO +18 48
>James: AIINTUV M3 VAI. +25 130
#note right after I played this I saw EXUVIA K8 and wasn't too happy. EXUVIA is best by far, and this is second best by far. 
>Siri: EGOY O4 GO.EY +33 81
>James: INOTTTU K8 ..IT +22 152
#note About an evin play with OUT N8 or OUTGUN H3. 
>Siri: FOP L10 FOP +23 104
>James: ?ENOTTU 10C TENUTOs +67 219
#note I missed OUTSPENT 12H and OUTWENT N8, which are slight favorites over this and TENUTOS 13F. 
>Siri: ADEMNRU N8 MAUNDER +81 185
#note 20-20 hindsight - had I found OUTWENT, he wouldn't have this. 
>James: EFLMORS O13 FEM +31 250
#note OMER O12 (which I missed) and REF M11 are favored first, but I thought it was worth it to kill the MAUNDERS spot while SSS? was unseen. I had a feeling the odds of Siri not having an S weren't that high. 
>Siri: ACEELNU -ACE +0 185
>James: CIILORS C6 COIS.RIL +74 324
#note It's a tie between this and CLITORIS C7, which I also saw but preferred not to expose the S for a 4 less. 
>Siri: AHK 8A HA.K +48 233
>James: AEJLNNO 12A JO.N +38 362
#note Best. 
>Siri: AEN A12 .ANE +33 266
>James: AEELLNT H10 .LEATE +21 383
#note Best. Though it opens up a few lanes, all of them will likely score little and I run the bag out faster. 
>Siri: BI F4 BI. +14 280
>James: DEEHLNS G13 HEN +23 406
#note At this point, so long as I don't make a mistake I've won. So I blocked up most of the bingo lanes again.
