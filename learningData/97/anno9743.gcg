#note didn't think it was  best at the time, but I guess it was.

>Nick: EGGHMNR 9H GERM +25 51
#note Quackle likes 9H GEM by a hair. Could have gone either way 
>Ira: ENORW 8K OWNER +40 99
>Nick: BGHNPTY 6I HYP +26 77
#note GEM definitely looks better now. I was undecided between HYP and PHT, and Quackle is too.

#note Quackle likes L2 GU(AN)O for 18.  or 7L OI for 11.
>Ira: DEJOU 6B JOU.ED +42 193
#note Ouch. Ira originally called this as 38, then we both agreed on 40. I guess it was 42. 
>Nick: CGIILNO F8 .ICOL +15 113
#note I didn't know if this was best, but it ends up simming at least as good if not better than the best play, 3L COIL 17.  I didn't like COIL because there were 4 Ss unseen and I sure didn't have one. Without the S, I wanted to open up another lane.

#note Best
>Ira: DEEERST 10I RESTED +30 257
#note Goodbye to 3 bingo lanes.
>Nick: AEIINOS 12D A..II +12 173
#note i thought this was slightly clever. It opened up a new lane with the outside chance of a J bingo down B. Quackle likes 7B OI. Seeing as there is no remaining viable front hook, it closes the B lane, and doesn't open anything, I'm not sure why.
>Ira: OX 14G OX +21 278
#note He closes it off

>Nick: EEINOST 7B OE +15 188
#note Sat on this for a good long while before decidding. Sims as good as anything else
>Ira: EOQTU A7 TOQUE +45 323
#note Ooops

>Nick: ?EINSTU I2 TU. +6 194
#note Opening up a line, keeping INS for a Bingo starting at B9. I realize he probably as an S, but at this point, I just want to save face and get one down. Quackle likes L4 (AN)E 15.
>Ira: ?CERRSS 1C SCaRERS +89 412
#note unfair.
>Nick: ?BEFINS L3 B.. +5 199
#note I pull BF to EINS? CMON!!! Figure the F is useful at 11B and keep it.
