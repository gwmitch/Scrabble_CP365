#note peter and I only bingo for over 80 points. it's a rule.

#note I would've thought the P was a better keep, but one subtle difference is that I give him free Z plays on column C after BIZ.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?EEFLMS C7 F.MELESs +97 187
#note he actually had selfsame double-double which he didn't know.

#note thus began the epic voyage of fishing for peter.

#note one off of ARDRIGH#. this play was really hard. I like what I came up with, but there was no star option. quackle actually really likes GADI at D10 though, since it takes some options away for him and keeps a good leave. I must've looked at it because I took ages on this play, but it didn't sink in as a superior option.

#note not a great leave but it does defuse the main threat

#note not a great rack normally but I had plays on either side on row 15

#note let this man bingo!
>jd: ?LOOTUU 15K .UO +5 368
#note couldn't figure out what the hell else to do. LOUT was unappealing as far as leave goes.

#note argh. nowhere for outhaul. at least I took out a lane with this play. now his bingos should give me back a play to the triple. quackle maybe prefers some other plays on valuation but I think this is ok.
>Peter_Armstrong: ACEINRT N6 TACRINE +70 382
#note at last!
>jd: ?IJLLTU 8L JU.o +60 452
#note good thing I spotted juco, because I am in some trouble if I don't.
>Peter_Armstrong: CEILNOW -CEILNOW +0 382
#note this is a cool move by peter - although it turns out his rack was terrible so he didn't have many other options.
>jd: AAILLNT J8 LAT. +6 458
#note figured I would take out the scariest lane. quackle prefers just playing latina, but I don't like that too much.
>Peter_Armstrong: GMNOPTW -  +0 382
#note peter challenged because he needed it to not be good.
