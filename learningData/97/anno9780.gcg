#note Static says 9E PIE 18 keeping ABEL.  I'd rather cover up that new hotspot (potshot).
>Robin_LaPrelle: AOQT E7 Q.OTA +28 40
#note Keeping an eye out for NONQUOTA now.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGILU 4G GUIDA.LE +63 155
#note She blocked DIAL(O)GUE, so at least I found this.

>Ryan_Fischer: AFHNOVY L12 OFAY +39 194
#note Definitely an interesting post-bingo rack.  Took a while here to find what static likes best.  Still, putting a Y there isn't ideal.  Wanted to use the H or F at 6J but couldn't figure out how to do so well.  5K is also key.
>Robin_LaPrelle: ?CCGINO 10A COaC.ING +66 185
#note Or COACHING.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHINSV 15H HEAV. +42 236
#note Bummed my bingo can't go down and I can't really use the C well.  But not to worry!
>Robin_LaPrelle: OY 14I OY +28 213
>Ryan_Fischer: EINPRSU 12A UPRISEN +85 321
#note RESUPINE and PRUINOSE also go down.  Of note: B5 PREUNI(ON)S 62.
>Robin_LaPrelle: AD 13H AD +11 224
#note Misscored as 15, I think.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEIINT A4 EIDETI. +33 354
#note Or IDENTI(C).
>Robin_LaPrelle: ENSV N2 EV.N +14 238
#note Clever...
>Ryan_Fischer: AGHNRRT 2J GARN.R +11 365
#note Really took a while trying to figure out how to block that E (or if I should block column O).  HANG(E)R gives too much back, so I played this to keep the H for scoring on the next turn.  K2 GN(A)R 14 blocks just fine, as does R(A)H.  THRU scores well, but creates more problems.  Of note: A(a)R(R)GH!  :)
>Robin_LaPrelle: ERX B2 REX +29 267
>Ryan_Fischer: HIOSTTU O5 OUTHITS +82 447
#note Well, that was just silly.
>Robin_LaPrelle: ABEFIMS N11 FEMS +41 308
#note Nice!  Champ says 5K B(E)A(NO), leaving FEMS for next turn, apparently.
>Ryan_Fischer: DJKLNWZ K2 .Z.N +30 477
#note Champ says J(A)W(A)N (34), and then Z(a) for 20.  I guess that's better than 30 then 26 'cause you lose the W, too.
>Robin_LaPrelle: ABIT F6 BI. +22 330
#note Plus, with JAWAN, you don't give up BIZ.
