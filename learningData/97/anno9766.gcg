#note aw CRAP. it's a vertical opening. game's already lost for me!!!
>cesar: CFGGRTU 6H CURF +25 25
#note yuck, i like going for points here. it's close between 10G TEGG, I10 FRUG, and this. (-0.5)
>mike_b: AGIMNTU J2 MATU.ING +67 89
#note see? it's all because of that vertical opening
>cesar: EEGGJOT 10F JE. +26 51
#note quackle prefers 3H GOATEE... i can see that. quackle is so clever. (-2.5)

#note 12L PITY sims significantly better. i saw it, but didn't really consider it. i don't like putting a Y there so much, or unnecessarily making the board more volatile when i can make myself likely to bingo next turn. i guess 34 points is significant tho, plus the leave is better. (-5.5)

#note i always have such a tough time against mike. ugh.

#note wow -- the right move here is tough. C9 MIAOU by quite a bit. i need to find this. (-8)
>mike_b: ?EENORU 14C nEURONE +67 339
#note blah...
>cesar: ACEIIMU C8 AMI +19 315
#note yeah, i could have found miaou, blocked neurone, and had the Z for 42. i think i still had a shot if he bingoed and didn't block AMINIC. i guess what it takes to be elite is to find hard stuff like miaou. now i need to find something super clever.  (-14) C6 AMICI

#note E5 CULL blocks less.... don't be hasty and try to give yourself the chance to come back. (-0.5%)

#note (-4.5) .... C8 AMIDO is awesome! NESTABLE/ABSENTLY and BASTILLE are definitely possible. also testable, stewable.
