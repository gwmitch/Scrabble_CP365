#note I played it all the way over because my rack is terrible and I didn't want him getting easy 7s. it sims fine. actually quackle likes exchanging and keeping MNOT best. against a human opponent I am not convinced that will work so well though.

#note spent a lot of time thinking about this one. saw monkey which is the main contender, but the rack just seemed too ugly.
>Ron_Howard: AFGINX 6D F.XING +33 146
#note interesting decision to discard the ing.

>Ron_Howard: ADEHIMN --  -65 163
#note minehead?? he has some rather good plays as is, too - I didn't really see them but he can play ANTHEM.
>jd: AADENTW 12J WAN.ED +24 271
#note I didn't predict his next move very well. I could've done something liked WAND but I knew I would give him WHINE (again, not seeing ANTHEM). I think my play is ok (get the game over, turn over some tiles, block some lanes) but I wish I'd seen his possibilities better.
>Ron_Howard: ADEHIMN H1 MAIDE. +33 196
#note daimen is probably a better choice for him here.
>jd: AEEQRTV 3G Q. +21 292
#note figured I would just dump the Q, block some lanes and move on with my life. I had the rack wrong initially but I believe this had to have been it.

>jd: AEEFRTV 2B FAVE +22 314
#note I'm a heavy favorite but quackle isn't crazy about this. sims become much harder to interpret when you're a heavy favorite. I like it fine.

>jd: CCGLOSZ K1 CLOGS +32 376
#note wow, all of a sudden I am in trouble and low on time. this is the wrong play. coz dumping the Z is right. and I went over on time. but at least I saw this spot. at least this way I knew I had a spot for COZ if he tried something goofy.

#note -10 for me for a 9 point win...and I almost went over more!
