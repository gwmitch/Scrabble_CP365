>elizabeth: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>cesar: AEIIOTX 8H AXITE +26 26
#note IXIA is the obvious move. i can't quite explain why AXITE makes more sense to me against elizabeth, but it has to do with board openness plus possible hook use. (-3.5)

#note 2J HUE was what i wanted to play, and makes sense with my rack, bt i dunno. MUT is also better than my move obviously. ugh. MOUCH/TOUCH sim best. (-5)

#note a turning point move? ZINCY seems absolutely reasonable to me. wrong move? COALY 4C ?? teach!!

#note ugh if i'd just played MOOL i'd have VIBES now. i don't want to be opening up scoring spots.
>elizabeth: AAK H12 A.KA +27 283
#note YES, I LET FUCKING ANKA GO.
>cesar: ABELOSY 1A LEA.Y +33 280
#note KAY 14H is the move. i wanted to score and save my S and kill a big spot, but BELOS looks like a good leave. (-5.5)

#note why can't i draw the bingo. it's not fair.
>elizabeth: BEG 11J BEG +26 341
>cesar: EENPRRS D6 PER +15 321
#note surely i'm close now. crap. i can't believe i let anka go. i was actually fairly sure it was phony, but knew that if i was wrong about it and challenged i'd be pretty unlikely to win. i thought i could catch up with leavy and a bingo. i saw 14B PERRY, didn't like that it gives her an easy comeback. i think PER is better.

#note what to do? fishing with ANGERS seems like the best move as it works with 2/3 of the pool. however, she's likely to try blocking on the right side, thus screwing up the D, E, I and R draws. so fishing will actually only work with 2 of the 9 letters in two spots! so why does quackle like K5 IF so much? or I5 IF? or anything that fishes off the F? argh. maybe GANEFS is right. i don't know. none of this crap would have happened without ANKA.
