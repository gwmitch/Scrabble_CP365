>James: CEENORU 8D COENURE +74 74
#note Best. 
>Ken: AITV D4 VATI. +20 20
>James: ?EGIJOR 6B JO. +26 100
#note I preferred this placement over JOE F6 or J6 - hold those open I thought would give me either COENURES or an -ING bingo through G8 for the most part. 

To Quackle, they're all about the same. 
>Ken: DEINNRT J5 INT.NDER +65 85
>James: ?EGIRST 11D tERGIT.S +82 182
#note Somehow I doubt there's much of a difference between this and most of the other bingos. I just picked this because aside from the placement of the I it didn't give back many possibilities for a good score. 
>Ken: EFU 10B FEU +15 100
>James: EIINOUV 12A VINE +26 208
#note I missed OEUVRE F7, which is a very interesting play to consider. I did pick VINE because it didn't open anything up needlessly, but the IOU leave is tough... it's probably as bad or worse as the IIN from OEUVRE. 

It's for this caution that I don't play OVINE K2. Quackle likes OVINE, VINE and OEUVRE about the same. 
>Ken: AB E5 BA +27 127
>James: HINOPRU 9F HUP +21 229
#note HOURI I5 is a nice play which I totally missed. Per Quackle's estimate, HOURI is dead tied with HUP, OH 9B (which I also considered) and INPOUR I3 (which I didn't see either). 
>Ken: AEIMPTX 7C X. +34 161
>James: ADILNOR H11 .ODIN +21 250
#note These plays are all so close again. AVOID/AVION A11, VOID/VIOL/VAIL/VIAL A12, IODIN H11... are all pretty much tied. I picked the one that got rid of the possibility of IZARS (not that major a concern I guess) and also did minimize any concerns from INTENDERS, but... 
>Ken: ADEHIOY 15A HYOIDEA. +98 259
#note It didn't turn out as well as I hoped. Rats. 
>James: AAALORT 14B ALTAR +35 285
#note On the plus side, I did get a really good return play. Best. 
>Ken: CFRU K2 CURF +28 287
>James: AMOSSTW 1H MOWS +37 322
#note I was going to play TWOS 3F before this opportunity came up but this or MAWS looked best to me. The score and blocking of the lane was worth it (though it did create its own lane). Quackle agrees on it being best. 
>Ken: EELPQR 3G PREQ.EL +44 331
>James: AAIOSTT 2K .OAT +16 338
#note I missed OSTIA N2 but wasn't sure what to do. I couldn't think of many good plays. Quackle likes STOAI N3, which confuses me, but maybe it shouldn't too much - after all, there aren't too many letters to go on the back of an I anymore (a D, N, S and blank). It also likes 13E TOAD - a solid fishing play, which makes some sense since I already have the S to PREQUEL. 

I did pick a bad play in COAT, thinking I could possibly get lucky he didn't have an I. It would've been a better idea if he hadn't just drawn 6 and possibly drawn an I, and worse, a Z. Had both come out like that I would've almost definitely lost. COAT was far below STOAI, OSTIA and TOAD. 
>Ken: GIW O1 WIG +28 359
#note Well, he did have the I, but luckily for me, not much else. 
>James: ADILSTY F4 AYS +30 368
#note I missed IDYLIST 14H, which is pretty much the runaway play to win. I also didn't think too much about SADLY 13J, which is apparently second best. 

I played AYS F4 because I thought it would put pressure on Ken and make him stop to think and perhaps make mistakes. Quackle puts AYS as third after IDYLIST (but 10% down on it) and SADLY (4% down on that). 
>Ken: BILO 2F BOIL +24 383
>James: ADILOST 13E DIL.OS +28 396
#note At this point, I am fairly sure if I do a fish for two, Ken will block and use his Z to build a large lead. So I decided to not do the fish. DILDOS scores best and leaves me able to draw 3 and perhaps get out before Ken. If I get lucky, I can outscore him to win the game or he will get stuck with bad tiles. 
>Ken: ?EEEMNZ L5 fEEZE +28 411
#note Ken had a few minutes but his only winning endmoves are hard to see. TEEN 7J for 5 leads to me playing TAKA 8L for 32, and him playing MAZE 6L for 41, winning by 3. DEEM 10J for 9 would lead to me playing GAMA M8 for 8, him playing MIRZa H4 for25, and me playing TALK M1 for 8, to end up losing by 1! 

As it is, I get lucky again and Ken makes the wrong play.
