>Steven: INOQTUU -  +0 0
#note Opponent exchanged 2.
>Richard_Spence: ENOOOOU -OOOOU +0 0
#note Yeah, not much to do here. Exchanging OOOOU was the best choice.
>Steven: AEIILST 8D LAITIES +66 66
>Richard_Spence: EEELNSY F4 EYEL.NES +65 65
#note I was already pretty fed up with my earlier tournament games today, as well as LAITIES and the fact that there's no R for SE(R)ENELY. I play aggressively with EYEL(I)NES* (I knew this was phony). The opponent didn't even hold.
>Steven: MOY E4 YOM +35 101
>Richard_Spence: BILNNPU D2 PUB +30 95
#note BLIP was better.
>Steven: DUW E10 WUD +23 124
>Richard_Spence: DFILNNR 7I FIND +23 118
#note This is a pretty hopeless rack. No E or S for FLINDERS.

>Steven: ABDE 6J BEAD +29 153
>Richard_Spence: EGHLNOR 5I HOG +28 146
#note I noticed LEGHORN, but it didn't play.Quackle likes OH 5J, keeping EGLNR.
>Steven: CFNOOUZ -  +0 153
#note Opponent exchanged 6.
>Richard_Spence: EELNRTT I7 ..LT +8 154
#note I had no idea what to do here, I thought about NET D11, but instead played (FE)LT.
>Steven: AISTX N2 TAXIS +38 191
>Richard_Spence: EEGNORT L1 RENEG..O +33 187
#note Style points for RENEG(AD)O. I wish I had an S.
>Steven: IQ O1 QI +35 226
#note X and Q already :/
>Richard_Spence: CERTTVW -CRTVW +0 187
#note Wow, should've played CRWT(H).I exchanged CRTVW.
>Steven: ACEGLNR 1F GLANCE. +30 256
#note Steven told me his other letter was an R.
>Richard_Spence: EIIOOST 2F OI +11 198
#note There goes my TO(P)OI play. I didn't want to play TO(P)I so I just played OI 2F. Should've played O(L)IO D7 10.
>Steven: JNU C1 JUN +28 284
>Richard_Spence: CEIOOST M8 SCOOTIE +76 274
#note Another one of those desperation plays. I obviously would've challenged SCOOTIE* if it was played against me. The opponent held, but didn't challenge.
>Steven: AR 1A RA. +30 314
>Richard_Spence: AEKNOOT A1 .OOK +13 287
#note I saw NOOK, but I was getting near the point where I needed a bingo to win.
>Steven: ?ADHRRT 14H ReTHR.AD +76 390
#note Nice play.
>Richard_Spence: ?AAEENV 15D VENAE +42 329
#note I spent several minutes on this play looking for either a 3x3 through the D, or deciding whether to play VENAE or EVA(D)E. I decided to play VENAE and leave one in the bag.
>Steven: AZ O13 A.Z +39 429
>Richard_Spence: ?AEFIIR N10 FE +28 357
#note Well, A(D)Z blocked my only out play, ApERI(T)IF 12H 80. I nearly ran out of time so I just played FE N10 28.
>Steven: MPRTUVW O8 PUT +21 450
>Richard_Spence: ?AIIR B4 AIR +11 368
>Steven: MRVW 11L V.. +6 456
>Richard_Spence: ?I O4 Id +13 381
