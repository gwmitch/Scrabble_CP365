>Daniel: ACEG 8E CAGE +14 14
>James: AFILNOP 7F FANO +20 20
#note I liked FANO because I liked the ILP leave overall. Quackle prefers COIF E8, because I guess ALNP is not a bad leave at this point in time. FOLACIN E4 is second, but I think it's not worth it to open up a DWS at E11. FLOC E5, leaving AINP, is another decent choice, because it scores 2 less but gives a slightly better AINP leave. 
>Daniel: AENP J7 NEAP +20 34
>James: IIILLOP K9 LILO +14 34
#note I wasn't sure what to do... a play like LILO was a gamble and I just felt like playing it. Quackle doesn't mind it at all - in fact, it's pretty darned close to the top play, POI I9, which is 5 points more and leaves probably about as bad a leave (IIILL v IILO). Exchanging is not a bad idea either, be it of all 7 or leaving perhaps L, IL or ILP. 
>Daniel: AHOX L12 HOAX +54 88
>James: AFHIIPY M13 PHI +38 72
#note Best. 
>Daniel: EINSV N10 VINES +49 137
>James: AFIMSUY J12 FAY +26 98
#note Best - it creates another opening and scores okay. 
>Daniel: AIO E8 .IAO +12 149
>James: IMSTUYZ 15G ZITS +49 147
#note I wasn't sure about MAZY 10D being better and it's not that much compared to ZITS. Somehow, I missed YUTZ F11. That's the best play by far. 
>Daniel: DEIILOT -DEI +0 149
>James: ?ADGMUY D11 GAUDY +31 178
#note Best. 
>Daniel: DEN 15A DEN. +24 173
>James: ?ELMORU L4 MORULaE +75 253
#note A few seconds after I played this I realized I missed LEMUROID A8. This is the second best play, but worse by a significant margin... 
>Daniel: EEINORT A8 ORIENTE. +80 253
#note And this is part of the reason why - a bingo against me to the triple is going to outscore most bingos to the double. 
>James: BBDELUV K3 BUB +26 279
#note I chickened out of BLUB K2. Second best play again, by a significant margin. 
>Daniel: ORTW F10 WORT +32 285
>James: DEIJLSV B4 JIVED +27 306
#note Best. 
>Daniel: AGQU J1 QUAG +26 311
>James: ALNSSTT 5K ..LT +6 312
#note I missed the better plays - LATS 6G, or TINS 9D (I missed FANWORT and SNEAP). However, I wanted to make Dan think hard about what he wanted to do. Unless he had the blank and a Q-6, a bingo is threatened on the O column I can use. Also, with a lot of Rs out, TRANQS 1F 45 is a great threat. 
>Daniel: DEEIMR N1 MERI.ED +24 335

#note Best.

>James: ?CES O6 SECt +20 377
#note And again, lucky me.
