#note Geoff underscored this by one, and neither of us caught it.
>Dave_Koenig: EIMTUVX G13 VUM +29 262
#note At this moment, this game was like nearly every other one I've played with Geoff.  I feel like I'm drawing well and scoring well, and yet every time I look at the score, I'm down by at least a bingo.  Things were starting to look grim, as this board is getting harder and harder to bingo on.  But after the next couple of moves, the situation suddenly changes.
>Geoff_Thevenot: BIIOR B8 ORIBI +11 338
>Dave_Koenig: ADEITUX A10 TAXIED +89 351
#note Wasn't expecting that!  Suddenly the tight board favors me, and Geoff looks like a heavy underdog.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AIU 6K .UIA +9 347
#note Interesting.  I was all set to play CUIF B2, locking down the board, when I felt confident I would win.  Geoff's play clearly seems to be a setup for the S, or maybe the blank.  But he also just spent three vowels when there are only five more unseen to me.  I can see that his bingo chances are slim, but even a Z play on column O can be enough to catch him up.
>Dave_Koenig: CCFLNUY N5 C.NFUL +13 364
#note This made sense to me at the time, since I'm trying to win the race to the blank, S and Z and end the game fast.  Also, with only one A unseen, it is likely that my Y may land on 8O first.  However, in retrospect FY 7M looks like a better way to play defence.
>Geoff_Thevenot: OPT O9 POT +11 358
#note I didn't sniff out what Geoff was doing here, but even if I had, I'm not sure I could have done anything differently.
>Dave_Koenig: CEILOOY 3M LO +14 378
#note From my point of view, his most likely next play looks like HAD 3K, which scores enough to put me in trouble.  This play takes out the spot, scores decently, temporizes well, and leaves tiles that I can use to keep scoring in the endgame with.  With more thought, I might have been able to see the POTHEAD possibility, but it still would have been right to do what I did, since it would be harder for him to have POTHEAD than HAD.  But it turns out he had something else.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?RSZ O9 ...ZeRS +81 439
>Geoff_Thevenot: ALRR (challenge) +5 444
#note Geoff had ?SZ when he played POT and was fishing for one of the three unseen Rs.  Brilliant.  I knew the word but made a desperation challenge anyway.
>Dave_Koenig: CDEHIOY 14J CHIDE. +36 414
>Geoff_Thevenot: ALRR L12 RA.L +10 454
>Dave_Koenig: OY L8 .OY +18 432
>Geoff_Thevenot: (R) -1 453
>Dave_Koenig:  (R) +1 433
#note Geoff outbingoed me 3-0, but bingos weren't the story of this game.  He remarked afterward that the two highest scoring plays were nonbingos.
