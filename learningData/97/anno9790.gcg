>Jim_Burlant: ?ADINSV 8B INVADeS +78 78
#note Style preference as to which bingo to play, as I can't double the V without positioning a vowel next to a double-letter.  Q prefers 8B NaVAIDS by roughly 1 point at 800 2-ply iterations.
>Chris_Cree: EHO 7G HOE +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: FGIMNOP E6 FO.MING +26 104
#note  This is runner-up, but the 2-ply sim prefers 9E MOP by 8 points to this.  8?!?  Really?  Championshp player thinks this is a 6-point dog.  I'd rather unload the F.
>Chris_Cree: ADENSST 10A SAND.EST +63 84
#note All of Chris's bingo options score 63, and this is the safest of any of the placements for Chris.  He's winning 33% with this choice.
>Jim_Burlant: BEOPRRU A10 .UPERB +39 143
#note Considered ROPEBURN*, but discretion was the better part of valor and I was pretty sure it was bogus.  This is best, nothing else worth consideration.
>Chris_Cree: ALOTV F2 VOLTA +25 109
>Jim_Burlant: CDGORRU J7 DRUG +18 161
#note The best play is a word I didn't know, H10 TURGOR.  Runner up is something I didn't see, C8 NONDRUG 20.  This is the bronze medalist, roughly 5-1/2 points down on TURGOR.
>Chris_Cree: AFGOT 12C FA.GOT +24 133
>Jim_Burlant: CDIIJOR K10 ODIC +17 178
#note The best option here is another word I didn't know, 9I JURIDIC for 27.  I don't like a lot of the other options Q prefers, as they either don't score squat  (not that this is lighting it up) or, if they score more than 20, they leave me duplicated I's or have poor board position.   I don't mind trading up to 10 points to make sure I don't leave a pair of I's in my rack. And the 13F placement of this word for 22 could give back a lot more than I get for this.  This seemed like the most reasonable compromise:  4 tiles turned, scores better than the best pure rack balancers, and doesn't open up anything too dangerous. 
>Chris_Cree: AIMU 4B MIAU. +14 147
>Jim_Burlant: AEIJRST B2 JA. +24 202
#note Too bad he blocked the O, as JAROSITE would have scored 84 and really put Chris in the hole.  As it is, I'm about to blunder a bunch of my winning chances away.
>Chris_Cree: EOPRU 8J .EPOUR +33 180
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIRST -  +0 202
#note Had not paid attention to the V in row 2 and his play of REPOUR blocked my intended L4 bingo of ASTERIA.  REPOUR "looked funny", so I challenged.  VARIATES wins 89% in a short sim, and forfeiting my turn wins 68. Nothing like pissing away 21% winning chances with a completely avoidable decision.
>Chris_Cree: EOW 13G WOE +22 202
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIRST 2F .ARIATES +63 265
#note Better late than never.  This is the only playable bingo and it wins 79% in a short sim.
>Chris_Cree: BELO 1L BOLE +36 238
>Jim_Burlant: AEHLNXY 1G HEX +59 324
#note If you know Chris, you know his reaction, especially in light of the fact that he'd just drawn a U-less Q.
>Chris_Cree: QT 3A Q.T +28 266
>Jim_Burlant: AEKLNYY B13 LEY +25 349
#note Hmm.  Q doesn't like this, preferring that I go for offense with 14A RANKLY.   Counterintuitive to open up, but given that the O column is still a threat, maybe I should maximize score and turnover just in case the Z or blank are still at large.  The nice thing about RANKLY is that scores 42 and increases my lead to 100 points, which will give me enough cushion to withstand practically any bingo he can hit.  I didn't see RANKLY at the time, as I was only looking at overlapping defensive plays. In retrospect, I'm not sure this was a good choice.  It still wins 91%.  RANKLY wins 95.
>Chris_Cree: EINW 3J WINE +32 298
>Jim_Burlant: ?AIKNRY N6 KA.RY +30 379
#note Not playing for the bingo.  Quackle wants me to play G1 HAY , 12C FAGGOTY, or I11 KY(E) and not block.  Pfft.  I didn't see any 8's from the T on row 5, and I wanted to interfere with his most probable lines, so this was my play.  Good thing I did, as Chris was going to bingo on me with C(U)TINIZE for 92.
>Chris_Cree: CEIINTZ 4H ZINC +36 334
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILNR 15A ..LINERs +39 418
#note If I played KY(E) I11 as Quackle had wanted me to, I'd be sitting on AINR? plus 2 of ELR.  This gives me possible racks of AEILNR?, AEINRR?, or AINLRR? and only one of those racks would have yielded a winning out bingo.  Take that, duck!  Anyway - this is my best play.
