>James: BHNRUUW 7H BUHR +17 17
#note I missed AUBURN H8. That's far better because HW is a much stronger leave than NUW... HUB 7H is also good. 
>Jan: CEIR 9F CIRE +29 53

#note Best. 
>Jan: BFI L8 FIB +21 74
>James: DHILLWZ 3J Z.LL +26 69
#note DILL M9 is a very interesting move that Quackle suggests - the idea is that ZA N10 is very likely in coming turns. It's so cute and the placement of the Ls make it very hard to see that being blocked effectively. ZILL is next on the list. 
>Jan: AGLU 5K .UGAL +13 87
#note I am not sure what to make of this play. Maybe Jan read that I had bad tiles somehow and played this? 

>James: ?ADHIVW 6N HI +28 97
#note I wasn't sure whether VAW N4 was a better idea or not. I decided to go for the points instead. Quackle favors VAW by a large margin, and DIVA 9K, HWAN 4H (among other plays) are next on the list. The leave of ADHI? is far better than ADVW?, meaning that even the points aren't that much to consider. 
>Jan: EGNNTT O1 NETT..NG +90 177
#note Ouch. 
>James: ??AADVW 11F VAWArDs +82 179
#note Best. 
>Jan: AIORRTT N1 OR +10 187
#note Jan said she had something akin to AIRTT as a leave, so there wasn't much to do for most other plays. I thought CAVORT F9 or RIOT 9K are better ideas.

RIOT does sim best. The score and decent leave are best. OR is not a bad idea because Jan's hand leaves her potentially likely to draw an -ION 9 but even then, maybe WIRRA H11 is still worth it instead. 
>James: DELOOPR H11 .ORLD +30 209
#note WOOED H11 is favored greatly by Quackle - the LPR leave is better than EOP, though I thought EOP is more balanced. LPR has more playback possibilities (not least RIP 9K), but also because half the bag left is vowels, meaning it's quite likely I will draw two vowels again next turn. 
>Jan: AIORTT 1H ROTATI.. +27 214
>James: AAEEOPY 4I PA.E +29 238
#note I thought points were a worthwhile consideration. Also, if I got stuck, there's always COVEY F9 to play off vowel tiles, or OBEY 10K. 
>Jan: EEMNOO 14B OENOME. +30 244
>James: ADEEOOY 13H .OADEO +16 254
#note I missed EYRA 13F and thought of OBEY 10K and BOYO 10L but thought ROADEO was a better idea. There being four Ss out, I thought I may be able to pick up something worthwhile. Also, me having a Y already could make use of 14J.
