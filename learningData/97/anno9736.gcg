#note apparently, my brain is still fried. of course, I6 FORK is better. i saw FOLK and didn't like the relative closedness and the big hook, but that is still much better than my move. still, i don't feel terrible about offing, although i knew it would sim worse. (-11.5)

#note really playing quite badly here. 4I AVOW is of course better. C3 INWOVE sims best. but even something like 11C WAIVES would do great. (-17)
>winter: ?DENRTV K1 VERDaNT +72 114
>cesar: EHINSUU 1K .ENUS +27 77
#note 3C UH is the obvious choice. my thought was that i need to take an easy scoring spot, and didn't like the potential of EINSU too much. (-10.5)
>winter: EHMS 2J H.MES +46 160
#note well, i was trying to sorta block that.

#note call it a sixth sense, but he is certain to have a huge play at B10 so it's essential to play on column C. the top plays all are on column N... but no. (-3.5)
>winter: IQ 12B QI +24 284
#note i bet you he had the U
>cesar: AEELPSU 8A AU.E. +18 257
#note i guess i had the last U :P
>winter: AAG F9 AGA +19 303
>cesar: EELMPSZ M11 M.ZE +30 287
#note well M11 MEZE made perfect sense. it scores and sets up my S. quackle though rightly concurs it still gives too much back, plus it's the obvious spot to try blocking anyway. M9 MEZES is better. (-4)
>winter: ADJP 14J JAP.D +62 365
#note yeah
>cesar: DELNPSW H12 ..WD +30 317
#note for some reason quackle says D3 WIN is winninger by about 11%. i don't buy it. i seem to have valued ELNPS over DENPS and DELPS. 
>winter: AIORRYY N9 RYA +18 383
#note with BONSPIEL unseen to him (he drew the O) blocking either lane should give him an 87.5% chance of winning.
>cesar: BEILNPS A4 BIPL.NES +65 382
#note he chose the wrong one!
