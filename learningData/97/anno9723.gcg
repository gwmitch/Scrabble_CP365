#note This was not a fortuitous turn of events. Quackle slightly prefers throwing back the third N too, but I like keeping it.

#note Nothing looks very good here - I figured I'd keep some cohesive scoring tiles. HALID and PALLID (both C5) are both slightly ahead of my play, likely because of the hotspot the create, as well as the additional turnover. What do you like here?

#note Quackle puts this play even with POH in the same spot. Not sure why POH sims so well - this sets up ZIP for 42.

#note With all of Quackle's suggestions, I'm in deep trouble if I draw the Q. This guarantees two Q spots, and therefore a win if I do get the Q. It sacrifices a lot of spread if I don't draw the Q, but I want a guaranteed win, don't you? I didn't go through all of champ's suggestions, but all the ones that win 3/4 or 7/8 still lose with the Q.

#note E(S)NES is best, but still loses.
