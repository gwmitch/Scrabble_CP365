#note This takes a D. Neither of us had any idea.

#note I knew QUOTE was better equity, but for some reason I was really paranoid about MISQUOTE and OUTQUOTE. And I really hated leaving all those easy back hooks open. However, MISQUOTER is still a word, and the back hooks really aren't that scary. Just do QUOTE here.

>Tunnicliffe: ABGOSTY J9 BOGY +20 228
#note Eeeeeh... I dunno what to do here. I missed both of the scoring plays from the R: RYOTS and ARGOSY. I think I like both of those with the score being what it is. BOGY was meant to sort of preemptively gum up the board, letting Ross have REFIT so I can hook QUEER next turn and weaken most of the new bingo lines. For what it's worth, Quackle likes BOGY best.

#note Damn. Don't know VITALIST. That's the nail in the coffin, likely.
>Brown: HOP F4 POH +38 157
>Tunnicliffe: AGILNOR N6 OR.GINAL +67 326
#note Really bad tunnel vision. CAROLING is better, and TRIGONAL is too. ORIGINAL is obviously way worse than those two. Yuck.
>Brown: ADNW O12 WAND +47 204
>Tunnicliffe: AIOPSUV M12 VAU +27 353
#note I hate this play. I knew it was going to be the equity play, but in a human game, it is absolutely moronic. Why give him a spot to bingo? Why give him a chance on this difficult board? I don't buy the 99.6% win chance.
>Brown: ?ABENOR 15G BORANEs +83 287
>Tunnicliffe: AAIIOPS 14I APO +25 378
#note I apparently mistracked and thought a big Z play was a possibility. I don't need to block there. I didn't see I6 PISO though.
>Brown: DIM 13G DIM +19 306
>Tunnicliffe: ADIIIKS 10F KIS +33 411
#note Yeah, I saw KADI to kill the lane, but I figured he would just bingo on the B column (again, poor tracking, there are no A's in the bag.) But I figured KIS was going to race his bingo easily anyways. Not a good play.

#note I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw eXSECT wasn't going to be enough. Anyways, it turns out Ross did have a winning endgame. And wow, it is not easy to spot. Kudos to whoever finds it.
