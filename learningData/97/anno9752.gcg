>James: EEKNSUU 8H UKE +14 14
#note I liked this because I had the N and the S hooks for the word. 
>Ed: IORU J4 OURI. +7 7
>James: ACENSUW G8 CAW +19 33
#note Best. 
>Ed: ABIO F10 OBIA +15 22
>James: ENSSTUY 12D UN.TY +24 57
#note It's very close between this, UNSAY 13C and SUETY K8. UNITY and UNSAY are basically tied, but I thought playing UNITY doesn't signal I have an S. However, maybe having EST as a leave is just worth it, because it would be very hard to block all the lanes. 
>Ed: HI 9G .HI +19 41
>James: AELLSST K8 SALLETS +75 132
#note Best. 
>Ed: HNO E8 NOH +15 56
#note I am not sure why here instaed of L12, for example. 
>James: DDEGOOO L9 GOOD +25 157
#note Best, but DOODOO 4H is cute and nice to think about. 
>Ed: ?GINRVW 4F WING.VeR +80 136
#note Very nice! 
>James: DEELLMO 8A MELO. +24 181
#note It was so nice I almost challenged. And I missed MODELLER. That being said, MELON is second best, along with YLEM H12 and LEMON 8A. 
>Ed: EFIV 5C FIVE +25 161
>James: DEEFLOX 3C FEDEX +71 252
#note Best. 
>Ed: DIMNOPT B6 PI.DMONT +75 236
#note Geez... nice again. 
>James: AELORTT 2B TORA +18 270
#note I was very concerned about PIEDMONTS, but I thought that instead of trying to block up that play, my best alternative was to create a counterplay that would at least give me a place to play. 

TORA is a good play but Quackle favors LYTTA H11 most (TORA is second best). The 6 points are worth it - the 42 point resulting lead is enough to overcome most plays of Ed's along the bottom. 
>Ed: AEU M3 U.EA +8 244
#note Wow, it looks like Ed has the same idea that I did. 
>James: BCEILNT 1E BICE +30 300
#note CLIENT 1E is favored most by Quackle, but only a very small margin over BICE. Thinking about it, I'd take CLIENT as well since the B is useful along N6. 
>Ed: EEJRS A11 JEERS +53 297
>James: ?AILNRT 15A .TARLINg +74 374
#note Lucky me... again. 
>Ed: IZ 13I ZI. +22 319
>James: AADPQRS D11 Q.A +12 386
#note Lucky win, lucky tiles. 
>Ed: EGT N1 GET +10 329
#note I can't figure out what the endgame is from here.
