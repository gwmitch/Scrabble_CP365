>James: EEEEIST -EEE +0 0
#note Best. Un-quadrupling, tripling or doubling the Es is best, and EIST is fairly flexible on its own. 
>Mina: AEHILN 8E INHALE +18 18
>James: BDEIRST K6 BISTRED +80 80
#note BESTRID K6 is tied with this. Maybe the BESTRIDE hook is worth thinking about? 
>Mina: ABEOTUY -ABEOTU +0 18
>James: AELLPWY L1 WALLEY +39 119
#note Oops, I actually thought this was good. A walley is a kind of jump in figure skating! WANLY F6 or WALLY L2 are the best legal moves. 
>Mina: FHNO L11 FOHN +31 49
>James: EEIOPXY M6 EPOXY +36 155
#note I missed OXEYE M4, which I think is a good deal better. Quackle says they're about even though. 
>Mina: UV 3L .UV +12 61
>James: EEEIIKR 1L .EEK +33 188
#note Best. 
>Mina: ?DPRSTU E4 STUP.DeR +90 151
#note Actually, I like this - she's still down after this bingo so keeping an easier bingo lane open is worth it (also, a bingo lane I'm not likely to play on unless I have a bingo or decent play of my own, fiven that FOHNS is a bigger priority to block). 
>James: EIINOOR N10 OORIE +21 209
#note Best, but it is risky. 
>Mina: AEOZ D1 ZOEA +50 201
#note And it's a tie game again. 
>James: AADINRV O5 NAVAID +37 246
#note Slightly behind VIAND O7 as the top play. VIAND is one less and leaves a better AR leave than R (but not a hugely better leave), meaning it's slightly valued as better overall). 
>Mina: EINW 1A WIN.E +51 252
>James: AJMRSTT 15H MARTS +36 282
#note Quackle favors JUT 6D much more than the scoring plays. In fact, it favors most fits (JUT, JET 10D, JAM 2K, etc) over the scoring MARTS and MATTS. It makes sense because with AMRST I am likely to bingo more often than not. That being said, I was getting a little nervous because having played off eight tiles recently, I assumed she was lkely to have an S as well. 
>Mina: ?EFNORT C3 FRONTEd +83 335
#note Well, this game went south in a hurry. 
>James: CIJNRTT 6B I.J.NCT +20 302
#note At this point I'm desperate to bingo and think I need to play into the bag, not so great set of tiles in there be damned. So I go for INJUNCT, which she doesn't challenge. Quackle still favors JET 10D though, because it sees me drawing correctly for a bingo. 
>Mina: BEIMSU B9 IMBUES +33 368
>James: AACIIRT J1 CARITA +23 325
#note I'd have IATRICAL had I not blocked it up. Quackle does say I have an okay chance of drawing a bingo if I play AIN 14J, but Quackle usually assumes the opponent won't block. So I tried to salvage spread since I couldn't think of a way to open up the board more. AIN does open but it's so easy to block that up and the E at 13B at the same time.
