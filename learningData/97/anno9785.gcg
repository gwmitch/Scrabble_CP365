#note H1 LICK is slightly ahead on the win percent, but it's extremely close.  I was considering LICK banking OX.

#note I took five or more minutes and still missed B8 LIVAbLE and ALVEoLI.  Either way, VALE for 42 keeping IL? isn't terribly bad, although VALI# is better.

#note Duck says LIRI, but I don't want to mess around keeping two Is.  I need to bingo.

#note Duck likes L3 IVY just slightly better.  I have the case S, so I can bank an S play for next turn, if it doesn't get blocked.
