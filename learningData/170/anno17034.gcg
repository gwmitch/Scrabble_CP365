#note AUK was Harry's winning move, setting up 2 Z-spots. He did not have the Z! From his point of view, there was a 64% chance I had the Z. He also needed the blank to win and those odds were even slimmer. He picked both the Z and blank from the bag. I love the fact that he never gives up. He is always giving himself a chance, no matter how small and this time it paid off handsomely.
