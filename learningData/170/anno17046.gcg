>Steve: EINQSUX 8F QUIN +26 26
#note Played too fast here, overlooking top play of 8D QUINS and third best 8G UNISEX. Surprisingly, my play is rated second by Q, both in terms of winning percentage (60 vs 63) and valuation (51-43). I really wish I had played UNISEX, however, but that may hindsight since I drew UL immediately, and could have been on the way to UNISEXUAL. I'm surprised that UNSEX doesn't make Q's list, keeping QI.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EORTV J6 VOTER +32 32
>Steve: EELSUWX K8 EXES +48 74
#note Best, tho K7 WE for 25 is a very close second choice.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: FIT L10 FIT +20 52
#note The fact he didn't use the T for QUINTET should have set off an alarm.
>Steve: EEFLNUW H7 W.FE +10 84
#note Best, surprisingly enough.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?ABEKRS L2 BeAKERS +93 145
>Steve: EILLNTU F8 .UILL +16 100
#note You have to be a better player than me to find the best play here. It scores 28. Quill is second best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AAIM M2 AMIA +30 175
>Steve: EEEIINT N2 NET +23 123
#note Thought about exchanging, which sims to be best, but figured I needed to get some points. TIE for 11 points at M11 is Qs second choice behind trading EEI.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GOO K4 GOO +33 208
>Steve: EEHIINT O1 HI +21 144
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ADEIORS 11A DARIO.ES +79 287
>Steve: EEINORT A4 ORIENTE. +80 224
#note Came too close to missing this, wasting about two minutes off the clock. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: HNST B10 H.NTS +45 332
>Steve: AACEOUU -AAOUU +0 224
#note Exchanging is correct, altho Q likes keeping EO.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BDN D10 B.ND +14 346
>Steve: CEGILWZ B1 CLEW +23 247
>Jeff_Fiszbein: INO 1A I.ON +21 367
>Steve: ADGIJRZ 6A .ZAR +33 280
#note M11 RAJ is best, followed by 2D ADZ.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AOPV D4 PA.VO +22 389
>Steve: DGIJRUY M11 RIDGY +25 305
#note I am very surprised to see exchanging 6 and keeping R is among Q's top choices. In fact, it was the top choice before a simulation (3-ply) shows a knock-down, drag out affair taking place among 5c YAGI and GUID at E2. 5c Y(A)UD is coming in third and my play isn't even registering. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: CLMOP 15H COMPL. +48 437
#note Winning the most letters in OLYMPIC prize for Jeff at the Walleye. He wouldn't have noticed, but Kopczak pointed it out while walking by postgame. Cha-ching.
>Steve: AEEJTUY 14I JEU +31 336
#note Another mistake, even tho I saw the best play E3 JAY and rejected it.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AADGU E3 GAD +20 457
>Steve: AETY A14 AY +17 353
#note N10 YET is best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AU 13F sAU +17 474
#note Note: I underscored myself on turn 4, by two points, and registered a 351 on the record.
>Jeff_Fiszbein:  (ET) +4 478
