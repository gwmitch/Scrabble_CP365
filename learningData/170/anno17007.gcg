#note a tough decision, with the exchange 1 I put a priority on trying to make 2x2s harder. BEEDI is probably not right anyway but it is worse, and DOBIE is worse because it puts a vowel there instead of a consonant. I can also play OBIA to not open a 2x2. in retrospect I would've liked to have played OBIA.

#note novel is a little more obvious but after novel all he has to do to block up the board pretty badly is to play at B10. GIVEN seemed to open the board a little better.

#note no need to play aeon and give him the cheap points if he has the P, EON is fine.

#note I thought the challenge was ok, my winning chances are terrible without it. if I must play something I could try to take some points for now with OINKED.
