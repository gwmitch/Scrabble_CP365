#note Considered this play, LI(P)OID, (C)IAO, (C)ILIA. This play just seemed to have the best balance.

#note Considered all sorts of plays here - this one, N1 AI(D)FUL, E8 AW(F)UL, H1 WAF(T), exchanging 5, 6, 7. I felt like I was going to exchange enough on future turns that I may as well take the guaranteed points now. I also liked that this play gave back very little. Maybe I have to stomach UW with AI(D)FUL, and hope she had a bad draw?
>Leesa: AEIMOSZ H1 AZO.EMI. +57 248
#note She held back an S here. Wasn't sure of (G)IZMOS.
>dacrON: HIIJNUU C11 .UJI +28 156
>Leesa: AEINNOT 12F ENATION +72 320
#note Lessa drew 7 tiles - AEINNOT. I picked N, T, and here remaining S. If only I had the foresight to throw the T back. :)
>dacrON: HILNUUU -HUUU +0 156
#note Yes, that's the right rack. I'm not really sure why I didn't exchange 7 - I think I wanted to sneak in a bingo somehow and then draw the power tiles...lol
>Leesa: BINT 14B B.NIT +18 338
#note A brief reprieve.
>dacrON: EHILLNR 13K HELL +21 177
#note I liked this play, as it tries to make something happen, especially as Leesa could have junk after B(I)NIT. Quackle likes 15E NILL, but I'm not sure what that makes happen.

>dacrON: AEIMPRT 1A IMPA.T +39 267
#note If you saw the gorgeous 9 here, props. You still wouldn't win this game, though. I actually maybe knew its anagram.
>Leesa: AEIKSTY 2B YA +28 508
#note Actual rack.
>dacrON: EIRSUVX O14 XU +36 303
#note I thought about fishing for (MY)XOVIRUS, figuring the ? was still in the bag. Turns out the O was, too, so I had a 50% shot at it. And then it turns out her play would've inexplicably blocked it, lol.
