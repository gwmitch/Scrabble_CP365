#note Had a mental gymnastics match gong on here - VAU? UVEA?  Which one?  Ultimately I felt like I couldn't give up 10 extra points on the scoreboard.  Quackle agrees - this is best. VAU J7 wins 2% less often and sims 4 points down.
>Mike_Early: ?DEEESU G3 UnSEE.ED +63 75
>Mike_Early: ?DEEESU --  -63 12
#note Best legitimate play is G7 EMEU or, if you're worried about opponent having an M or the X, EMU G7.  The best plays here win 61% and change.  Playing for 0 wins 47.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEOORS -AOO +0 22
#note Q says it's not necessary to exchange here - Given that my best "scoring" option is I7 AGO for 9 points (which is almost a passed turn), I didn't want to open a hook for an N that wasn't in my rack while he was sitting on the blank and I was only drawing two tiles.  Q says this wins 1% less often and sims 2 points down on I7 AGO.
>Mike_Early: ?DEEESU -EEU +0 12
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHRSZ K4 EH +20 42
#note Knowing he has the blank, I'm expecting him to hit from 9A or 7A, and crossing my fingers that he can't hit down the H column.   I played this to score decently, while keeping the Z in hand to ensure that I would have a comeback.  When simulated against a random rack, Quackle despises this play.  When simulated against DES? this sims respectably, as the bronze medalist. When simmed against the blank, the sim prefers AH instead of this.  Really?  Give him hooks for a D when he's sitting on DES?  Seriously?  Given this position I'd make this play again, Quackle's opinion notwithstanding.
>Mike_Early: ?DEEISY 9A SEEDIlY +76 88
>Jim_Burlant: AERRSUZ A4 AZURE. +48 90
#note I love it when a plan works out.  Q may not have entirely agreed with my last couple of choices, but there's no doubt about this - this is best.  49% to win.
>Mike_Early: AEFT B2 FETA +27 115
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENNRS E4 ANSeR.NE +78 168
#note Any number of 78-point bingos here.  Marginally better would have been GRANNIES or CRANNIES, but I benefit from this.  69% to win.
>Mike_Early: AEHIOOQ -AEHI +0 115
>Jim_Burlant: FIILOPR D1 FLIP +34 202
#note Q gives marginal preference to 3I RIFLIP, but this is a strong play in its own right.  I didn't know RIFLIP.  Still in good shape - 84% to win.
>Mike_Early: ATTY 1D .ATTY +33 148
>Jim_Burlant: IJORRTT A1 JO +32 234
#note I struggled here as I was looking for something like TRIJET, which didn't play.  Without a good rack balancer available I figured my only viable course was to take 32 points and deal with the rack on the next turn.  Q agrees - this is clearly best.  Next best option is L2 JOT for 24, which wins 2% less often and sims 6 points down.
>Mike_Early: CGINRST C7 CR.STING +78 226
>Jim_Burlant: EIQRRTT B12 QI +24 258
#note With ZIN and JIN no longer possibilities, this doesn't give back so much that I can't justify unloading the Q for fear of giving back a huge A13 play.   This is clearly best, and the rack grooming will have to wait one more turn.
>Mike_Early: BLO 9J LOB +13 239
>Jim_Burlant: EMRRSTT L1 TERM +22 280
#note I didn't look for anything else after I saw this.  Q agrees - this is best.  Fishes like 4D PART and K9 ORT also sim well.

>Mike_Early: ADELNNO --  -75 239
#note Seriously?
>Jim_Burlant: ADORSTW M8 TOWARDS +81 361
#note Only bingo.  99% to win.
>Mike_Early: ADELNNO A13 DON +16 255
>Jim_Burlant: ABIIILR 11J ILI. +8 369
#note The play that jumped out at me was LIBRI 12J, but I wasn't entirely sure if it took any back hooks (it doesn't), so I didn't take the chance. I don't have any really good options here; the only one that scores, BRASIL 14J, opens way too much up given the stage of the game.  If I had this turn to do again I'd play ORIBI K9, which I missed.  While the win is all but a done deal by this point, this could have cost me a bit of spread; the duck thinks this is only a one-point mistake.  I think I've made a bigger mistake than Quackle does.  Besides dealing with my triplicated I's, ORIBI does a much better job killing the southeast than this play.
>Mike_Early: AACDELN N2 CANDELA +76 331
>Jim_Burlant: ABHINRX O6 RAX +64 433
#note Not sure why I played this instead of NIX for the same points, but whatever.  The main thing here is to score 64 with the X.  
>Mike_Early: GOPU H4 POGU. +11 342
#note Asleep at the switch.  Why did I let this go unchallenged?  Aargh!
>Jim_Burlant: BEHINOU N13 OH +23 456
#note Board blindness.  These tiles score 28 at F5.
