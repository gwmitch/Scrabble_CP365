>Stephen_Debaccio: GNRTU 8D GRUNT +16 16
>Steve_Grob: CDEEHHV F6 HE.CH +29 29
#note I had a hard time with this rack, but found the top play by some miracle, and by trying a word that looked familiar but of which I was unsure as to its validity. The only other decent choice is E4 CHEV(R)E. What I didn't realize, until the post-mortem, is that HEUCH takes an S hook on either end.
>Stephen_Debaccio: AAINU D7 I.UANA +14 30
>Steve_Grob: DDDEINV 12A INV.DED +13 42
#note E3 VIDE. 12D (A)DD also gets some mention, despite only scoring 5 pts.
>Stephen_Debaccio: AEGOPST I6 POSTAGE +69 99
#note There's a beautiful 8 to the T at H8, and the 7-letter anagrams play for more at C1 if you're unfamiliar with the S-HEUCH hook. 
>Steve_Grob: BDEGORY J10 BODY +32 74
>Stephen_Debaccio: ?JMNRUZ C12 .UM +16 115
#note Somewhat of a curious play.
>Steve_Grob: CEEGRSW J4 GREW +21 95
>Stephen_Debaccio: ADS K10 ADS +27 142
>Steve_Grob: ACEIKSW A11 K.WIS +36 131
#note Down the list a ways. 5A WACKES tops the bunch, so not knowing the hook is costly. 14B S(M)ACK for 46 scores 10 more, but the EIW leave seems rather ghastly.

>Stephen_Debaccio: EIOO C2 OO.IE +10 222
>Steve_Grob: EMOPQXY B5 MYOPE +37 248
#note I had a lot of "fun" with this rack, deliberating my play for quite some time; even considered 2B P(O)XY, setting up the E-POXY hook on the A file, but that seemed too obvious. I totally whiffed on the P-REFACING hook, taking out Q's second choice of b4 POME, and somehow missed the top play of H1 MOX(I)E as well. Knew I was fading the J with this play, but the opp's last play seemed to indicate he didn't have it then, and there were limited O's still in play as well.
>Stephen_Debaccio: ELRV 8K V.LER +24 246
>Steve_Grob: AAOQRUX H1 QUA. +39 287
#note Vowels, oh wonderful vowels, I'm happy to see them at this stage of the game.
>Stephen_Debaccio: ABO A6 ABO +37 283
>Steve_Grob: AENORTX 2A OX. +20 307
#note Some nice overlapping paralell plays with the X are available in the M-file (M5 EXALT eg) that went by me,  but a sim shows my gambit play here to do quite well. It's second best to 13E OX; what I like about it mostly, is that it will tend to keep the bingo lines open, which bodes well when combined with my leave. Probably not as dangerous as it seems, given the remaining tile pool. Most plays here are in the 60-58 win percentage range here, while EXALT comes in at 56 percent.
>Stephen_Debaccio: EJL A1 J.LE +36 319
>Steve_Grob: AENNRTT 5B ..NA +24 331
#note Q likes dumping off the duplicates here with T(U)N or T(E)N, but I'm happy to take the points here and hope for the best. (E)TNA at F12 for all of 6 points and opening row 15, wins the sim surprisingly enough, and by a wide margin, 43 percent wins to 40 for either NET/TEN at 13F, N(U)T/T(U)N at 2G also come in around 40, my play just under 34 percent.
>Stephen_Debaccio: ?EZ N6 ZE.s +32 351
#note Playing the blank for 0 points in an effort to make bingoing down from O8 more difficult. He realized afterwards  gEEZ at N7 would have been better.
>Steve_Grob: AEINRTT O1 RETINA +32 363
#note Put this down quickly, then picked it up realizing it wouldn't win. Put it back when I saw nothing better; Q says O2 TETRA garners a tie somehow.
>Stephen_Debaccio: FILLTT 2J FLITT. +34 385
>Stephen_Debaccio: FILLTT --  -34 351
#note Opponent was still agonizing over his last play, and misses the winner.
>Steve_Grob: T 10C T. +2 365
>Steve_Grob:  (FILLTT) +18 383
