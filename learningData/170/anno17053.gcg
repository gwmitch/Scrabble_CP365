#note quackle likes the leave after FLU at 3F.
>JD: EINNPYZ A10 ZIP. +28 204
#note not sure what to do here, maybe ZINS or ZEIN because that leave seems the most potentially useful. I thought I was not in good shape at this point.

#note seemed like the kind of gambling move I had to make at this point, even if it doesn't win a sim he will often sacrifice points to block (or wipe me out if he has the S or ?)

>Jerry: AEGITTW 3F TWA +28 401
#note according to quackle jerry wins 68% of endgames by playing GAYEST here, whereas TWA is second with 49%. GAYEST is really good here because a lot of my endgames threaten XI at N13, and he also can draw another A and get TWA again to eke out some wins. tough find under time pressure.
>JD: ABEGIIX 2J BI.GIE +32 401
#note one point worse than BAGGIE. I didn't have the time to figure out how to win if he blocked XI at N13 after BAGGIE.
