>Joe_Edley: EEEPX 9E PEE.E +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: BCDIOSU J3 CUBOIDS +75 89
#note yeah dunno what I was thinking here. PEEVED and 10A to block the rather likely X setup. This is a largish mistake. I think I had forgotten PEEVE was a verb.
>Joe_Edley: ISX 10D SIX +55 67
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGIJRY 11C JIG +36 125
#note considered REJIG as well but no need
>Joe_Edley: AILNQT 4I Q.INTAL +34 101
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIRRY N2 DE.RY +34 159
#note di(a)ry I guess
>Joe_Edley: ?ADINOY M4 .OADYINg +71 172
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGIRR 8L G.RI +30 189
#note I believe this is better than B(Y)RE and G(Y)BE, especially GYBE because I need to respond to the imminent J underlap. I can better do that with the B. 
>Joe_Edley: KNOT 12A KNOT +41 213
>Joshua_Sokol: AAABERU 13C BEAU +40 229
#note like I said
>Joe_Edley: ELW O1 WEL. +26 239
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHMMRR 14F MARRAM +28 257
#note not HARM, right? I had just learned this word.
>Joe_Edley: DEORTU 15J REDOUT +33 272
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHNOPS H12 HE.O +33 290
#note (K)OPH? This spot seemed far more dangerous, especially after a 6-tile drop. The simulation agrees that Joe will average far more next turn if I play through the K. Not that I should fear a bingo response but this also blocks basically the only feasible lane. Since there are more consos than vowels HO(R)N is also decent. 
>Joe_Edley: NOW A12 .NOW +33 305
#note Now I am really really fearing FORE(KNOW). Pretty sure Edley sees these things. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ENOPSST 14A .PS +23 313
#note I considered it but I believe that I'm supposed to take out J13 this turn. I think I was too focused on my leave to realize that it didn't usually matter and that I would only very rarely draw something at 7A. He also doesn't have much that works at 14B. 25 isn't terrible. PESTO also permits me to draw an F which would help reassure me. This may have been a rather large mistake. 
>Joe_Edley: ACEFL 13J FECAL +31 336
#note The only good thing about this is that Edley no longer has an F.
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNOST K4 .ON +16 329
#note And I have all one-pointers, which is not that good of a thing right now. Had I played PESTO, on the other hand, I think I would be in a relatively better position. This wasn't a great move because it gives him more points for (Q)AT, doesn't score that much, and permits responses like the one we will witness. Of course it maximizes my chances of bingoing but that will almost never happen, especially after his response. 
>Joe_Edley: AEEFHIZ I6 EH +23 359
#note yeah.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFLNST 12G S.EAF +27 356
#note Do I really keep the F for FORE(KNOW)? It's such an outside shot... This was the only thing that scored, and I know how much trouble I'm in. There's really nothing I can do but score because I can't exchange. I considered FL(EX) but how often does that ever work outside of equity-whoring world?
>Joe_Edley: ORVZ O7 V.ZOR +17 376
#note If Joe kept the Z with FECAL it would have been sick to have drawn into ZEE M14. That is a threat I completely missed. Anyways given the pool I could see this seemed like his only good play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEILNT 12N Es +20 376
#note Really really difficult endgame here. I was trying to figure out if I could drow LE for an unblockable ANTIs(EX) but I couldn't. I thought that I would outscore if I played this as I had L(EX)/IL(EX) unblockable. The only problem is, I completely missed LAT(EX). That would have been my win. I'm supposed to play L2 IN(N) for the best sequence, but what I played wins so long as I spot LAT(EX). 
>Joe_Edley: AIITT 10L I.T. +6 382
#note this is his best play on the condition I miss LATEX.
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNT L2 TA. +3 379
#note -16 and I lose. I'm supposed to play IN(N). I had around 3 minutes to figure that out. 
>Joe_Edley: AIT M1 TI +7 389
>Joshua_Sokol: ILN F7 IL.. +11 390
#note so I lost deservingly. This was the most skill-based game I can think of in a tournament game I played in. 
>Joe_Edley: A N10 .A.. +6 395
#note Great game, congrats to Joe on winning the tournament with my help! ;)
>Joe_Edley:  (N) +2 397
#note Great game, I had the win though.
