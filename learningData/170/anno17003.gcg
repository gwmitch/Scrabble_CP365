>dacrON: EINSTVX 9F VIXEN +40 40
#note Doug likes close boards, so it seems safe to assume he has an S here, otherwise he would've played AHOY.

#note Didn't consider 7F DAFT. Maybe that's better?
>Doug: AGINZ O1 A.ZING +54 211
>dacrON: EOPRSTT G8 ..T +6 146
#note *please dont have EG, please dont have EG, please don't have EG.* I assume I am right in preferring this to (HI)P?
>Doug: EG F9 .EG +13 224
#note My brain exploded.
>dacrON: EOPPRST 4I PE.RO +28 174
#note I thought I might be able to get some spread back by taking the main scoring spot here, knowing that I could reopen the board if I got any of the 4 remaining As at any point in the game (spoiler - I never get an A). I'm not really sure what the best play is here, but I figured it was best not to fish again, since I was a bit frustrated. M1 P(R)OP(S) might be a better option?
>Doug: ACO 10J OCA +15 239
>dacrON: NOPRSTT L9 P.NT +12 186
#note Completely at a loss what to do here. Considered going long with a 6 in ANOPRT, fishing G4 P(A)T, or throwing the O on now. As was the theme with this game, I was in trouble no matter what. And it goes way downhill from here.
>Doug: AIQSU 13I QUASI +55 294
#note You can't pay for defense like JARRED, VEG, QUASI lol.
>dacrON: NORSTUW G4 N.W +6 192
#note Oops, 11B WRUN(G) is better. This doens't bingo enough to make it worth it - especially since he will go for the block.
>Doug: LOO F3 LO.O +17 311
#note Describes this game well.
>dacrON: LORSTUW 9L .OW +9 201
#note This play is awful. I have no idea what the right play is here. I was hoping maybe he had finally run out of As and Os, especially because I still had no A to play at E11.
>Doug: AAB 8M BAA +24 335
#note No As for me!
>dacrON: ILRSTUY 3C YIL. +14 215
#note 14I IT? I give up.
>Doug: ?DEEIMR 14D DEMERIt +77 412
#note lol.
>dacrON: BKLRSTU D2 B.LK +20 235
#note ooh, SUB(CAVITIES) is fun.
>Doug: ?EINNRT 15A INToNER +78 490
#note LOL!
>dacrON: EFORSTU 10J ...S +11 246
#note Going for FOURTEE(N) 1/4. Doesn't show on the sim, but I think it's a reasonable effort.
>Doug: EEGIOTU E6 TUI +9 499
#note 13D UTE.
>dacrON: EFHORTU 13E FEH +34 280
#note I figured blocking was better, but this game put me out of contention anyway, and I needed it to be done. HOUR(I) is 17 better.
