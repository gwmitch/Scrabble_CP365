#note Context - despite myself, I'm solidly entrenched in first place.  Chris is in second, one game and a whole lot of spread behind me.  If I lose the game, I can still lose by less than 158 and still win the tournament.  As for this - the duplicated E killed me.    This is clearly best.

>Jim_Burlant: ACCENRR 10F C.R +11 23
#note A little worried about the S hook I was opening up, but I also figured that ACENR was so powerful that it'd be nuts to break it up for only 26.  The sim gives marginal preference to CANCER F2, with this winning 1% less often and simming 3 points down.  Had I known how ineffective my fishes were going to be, I'd have broken the rack up.  
>Chris_Cree: AEILSST 12G SALTIES +81 127
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINRR H12 .CRE +18 41
#note Bad, and now my brain melts.  With none of the 8's (CURARINE, CRANKIER, JERRICAN, and CINERARY) playing, I needlessly freaked.  I couldn't find anything at H10 and never looked at 8J.  RACIER scores 35 at 8J and wins 13%.  This wins 11 and, frankly, it sucks.
>Chris_Cree: BFI 6J FIB +29 156
>Jim_Burlant: AINNRTX K11 N.X +20 61
#note With NIXE J4 blocked, I felt my best course of action was to keep as much of the rack together as possible; hence, my decision to forego 11J AX.  This bore fruit...sort of.
>Chris_Cree: ?LOTYZ 8J ZLOTYs +69 225
#note What does he do with this if I play RACIER a couple of turns back?
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINRT O8 .ANTERIA +74 135
#note Still bleak - barely 6% to win.  O1 RATANIES wins less often.
>Chris_Cree: AAEHIPT 5K HA +24 249
#note His rack.  Had I played anywhere else he was going to hit me with APATHIES O1.
>Jim_Burlant: BDNNPTU 4L DUNT +24 159
#note Apparently I should play M2 BUND.  Regardless, my early mistakes combined with these draws have put me in a terrible spot - I'm 3% to win the game, and I'm precariously close to already being down by more than the 158 points that will lose this tournament.  I was beginning to unravel.

#note Talked myself out of GAPPY and felt that my only way of making sure I stayed in this was to pull out the stops and let it all hang.  Best is apaprently E5 BY, and that does make sense in retrospect:  it opens up the left side of the board while unloading the B and Y.  This?  I pay dearly.
>Chris_Cree: AKU 1L KA.U +42 362
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIOPS 4B BIGO. +16 211
#note I'm beyond frazzled by now.  This could not have gone worse than it has, and by now I had lost what little focus I had had.  BOGIE E5 scores 36 to this play's 16 and keeps things alive for me.
>Chris_Cree: OW 1F .OW +24 386
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNPST 5E P.G +20 231
#note While I've played like crap, these draws are also not helping me; this is the 5th time in 8 turns that I've gotten the same negative tiles back that I've gotten rid of, and the bingo isn't coming fast enough.  
>Chris_Cree: DEOV J10 VO.ED +32 418
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNST 15B ENLIST.D +60 291
#note As horribly as I've played, I've gotten just close enough that this is going to be nip and tuck for the tournament win.  I'm back within 127 points, and the magic number is 158.  
>Chris_Cree: JMOO C11 JOMO. +28 446

#note I had to at least make one good play this game.  This is 
>Chris_Cree: EEIIMOS 14G I.I.ES +23 469
#note And now I seal my fate.  IRIDES puts him up 146 points - 12 short of the 158 he needs for the tournament win.  All I have to do is let this go, put down practically any acceptable play that unloads the W and H, and take the tournament win home.  Instead, I get greedy.  Knowing with 100% certainty that IRIDE* is no good, I think for sure he's trying to pull a fast one on me, and I want to have my cake and eat it too.  So I challenge this...and am utterly shocked when it comes back good.
