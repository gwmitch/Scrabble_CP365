#note My turn to not know the bingo.

This play does so many things to the board that I want to see with a (soon to be) 100 point lead.

>Spherulitic: AEEINRU K2 .AUN +18 281
#note I swear, I played a couple real words in this game.

I considered 11L AUE as well, but wanted to take out the last S hook on the board.

>Spherulitic: EEGIRRT J12 .EG +20 301
#note Have to infer that opp has a mouse here. Something like TIGER isn't really right. I think VEG is the best block you can come up with -- plus it's the highest scoring play available.
>Keller: AIIOSTV 15H VIA +26 232
#note This play actually sims well -- second best after VISTO -- but it's terrible. It does my work for me of killing the bottom half of the board, and lets me concentrate on the top half of the board. If you don't want to burn the S, play IOTA. VISTO recognizes that you need to get lucky, and ensures that you are close enough in score that if you do get lucky, a bing will catch you up. Passing up that many points just means that when your bingo hits you're still behind, and if on row 4, you're giving me 30 points as a comeback in column A, so you're still a huge underdog. 
>Spherulitic: EINORRT J4 TOR +12 313
#note The new R lane is easier to hit a bing, but it's a weak lane. Mostly just trying to groom my rack so when he bings, which he probably will, I have a good comeback.

>Spherulitic: BEEINOR D4 .ENEBRIO +63 376
#note I should be OK if he's drawn a big Z play at 12A because hopefully I'll get the 40 point play on column A.
>Keller: AEGL 8A GLE.A +24 324
#note He was trying to pull the Z and leave himself with FRITZ in B column or a big play at 12A. However, if I have a mouse, this play lets me score 40 covering A12 and takes out any risk of a game-winning bingo through my play or through RIOTISE. At that point, FRITZ may not be enough.
>Spherulitic: ADDILRS 12A DADS +38 414
#note Q thinks I should block FRITZ and keep ZILA as a comeback if opp hits 12A. Smrt.
>Keller: DEFNRST B10 FR.TS +32 356
#note Lucky for me the Z was in the bag.
