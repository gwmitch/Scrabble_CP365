>Jackson_Smylie: CENNUUZ -NUUZ +0 0
#note Thought about keeping a number of different leaves, with the Z. Quackle likes keeping CEN. I don't see the Z as being particularly useful at the beginning of the game, but CEN could be good if he opens with a longer play.
>Glenn_Mosher: ?AAEINO 8D AEOnIAN +64 64
>Jackson_Smylie: BCDEMNW F7 W.MB +17 17
#note WEBC(A)M D4 is definitely better. Not sure I would have played it even if I saw it. CWM 9C mucks up the A, WOMB creates an S hook. 
>Glenn_Mosher: AFRY 9H FRAY +21 85
#note He said he saw the 11C placement just after he hit his clock.
>Jackson_Smylie: ACDEIJN 7I JANE +40 57
#note I was wary of JADED, but I guess he plays at 8L too often to make that a big worry. I liked that in case he played at 10J or something, CDI could guarantee more points than CIN. Quackle likes JADE.
>Glenn_Mosher: DENR 8L NERD +21 106
>Jackson_Smylie: ACDHIIR K9 .ID +14 71
#note I think YID leads to a more open board than most other plays, and I want that since I can foresee this board getting clogged up soon.
>Glenn_Mosher: AQST 11C QATS +38 144
>Jackson_Smylie: ACEEHIR 12A CHIA +39 110
>Glenn_Mosher: AEP A12 .APE +24 168
>Jackson_Smylie: EELOORS 14A .OO +10 120
#note This was a tough turn because I had to make the decision to go for the bingo or to try to catch up with scoring. SLOE scores 35, which puts me down 23. I didn't see TOO E11, which looks pretty nice. (P)OO creates a better lane that scores more and gives back less, though. 
>Glenn_Mosher: DITYZ 15C DITZY +22 190
>Jackson_Smylie: AEELRSS 12I RESALES +74 194
#note M2 RELEAS(E)S has got to be better, even if it opens. Damnit!

>Glenn_Mosher: OOX 13M OXO +35 225

>Glenn_Mosher: BEIIORV -  +0 225

>Glenn_Mosher: GIV K3 GIV.. +18 243
>Jackson_Smylie: CFIIRRU D4 CURI. +14 312
#note CU(I)F is probably better for this immediate turn, but it leaves me with drek and not a *huge* lead. CURI(A) does leave a few very bad lanes open, but in one more turn they can be gone. FIR is also a lot more manageable.
>Glenn_Mosher: BEV 6B VE.B +17 260
>Jackson_Smylie: EFINNRU 4G FUNN.ER +22 334
#note FUNNIER over UNIFIER because it gives back fewer cheap overlaps, and there are a lot more consonants than vowels in the bag. Although, there are two I's, so it may be a tossup.
>Glenn_Mosher: ENPRU H1 UNP.RE +24 284
>Jackson_Smylie: ?IILLTT 2B LITTLI.g +68 402
>Jackson_Smylie: ?IILLTT --  -68 334
#note LITTLI(N)g was a very stupid play... if he bingoes now, I definitely risk a loss. I was greedy for more points, I should have taken a much safer option though.
