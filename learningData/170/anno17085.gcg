#note Should I have decided to burn the S this turn, fearing Kurt's likely response of pluralizing DIURETIC? SNYE is 33...

#note or not
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDNNSX L13 N.X +18 171

>Kurt_Davies: AZ 13I ZA +44 360
>Joshua_Sokol: JLNOOSV M2 JO +28 305
#note M1 OVOL(I) maybe. I hoped he didn't have an O.

>Kurt_Davies: EEGINPS B4 SEEPING +71 467
#note Kurt also considered (V)ESPINE here, and other plays blocking the 3x3. The only 3x3 I can have is SA(V)ORING, and that is Kurt's only loss after SEEPING. (V)ESPINE seems to win all of the time.

#note This is the incorrect play. Kurt didn't expect me to play AGS and didn't look for outs for himself.
