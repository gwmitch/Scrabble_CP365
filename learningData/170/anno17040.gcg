>Ed_Gowach: BOP 8G BOP +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: EIKMOSW 7H WOK +21 21
#note The question - how dangerously do I want to live?  WOK for 21?  Or WOKE for 22?  I felt that, as dangerous as it was to open up the 2x2 column for the E hook, EIMS was too powerful for me to be so paranoid.  Quackle agrees - this is best.  For reference, WOKE wins 3-1/2% less often and sims almost 7 points down.
>Ed_Gowach: ACDE K4 DACE +25 39
>Jim_Burlant: EIMOSTV 9B MOTIVES +75 96
#note My reward for keeping the E.  The other playable bingo is G8 BEVOMITS.  That scores 67 and slots the 3x3; this scores 75 and doesn't open a 3x3, case closed.  65% to win in a short sim.
>Ed_Gowach: ITZ 6F ZIT +39 78
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIQT 8A QADI +55 151
#note Luck box!  76% to win.
>Ed_Gowach: AEFHS 8K SHEAF +53 131
>Jim_Burlant: AAEENOT 4J O.EA +10 161
#note I didn't autopilot this and wondered if I should just groom the rack or score.  The only scoring play is one I didn't look very hard to find:  7C ANOA.  This did the best job grooming the rack of anything I saw.   It's not ideal that this opens up row 3, but that line won't give back more than a 65-point air ball.  Q says this is mediocre, but this worked out in style.  ANOA wins 62%; this wins 58 and change and sims roughly 6-1/2 points down.
>Ed_Gowach: MSW M3 M.WS +18 149
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNT B7 L..INATED +78 239
#note The only bingo option I have that doesn't slot the 3x3 is INFLATED O6, and that only scores 63.  ENTAILED M8 scores 70 and this scores 78.  Q agrees - it's best.
>Ed_Gowach: NOU 15A U.ON +18 167
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEJLR 13B .AJ +20 259
#note A somewhat tough position.  I considered 12A JARL but thought it too likely to be leading to a guaranteed exchange on my next turn.  I didn't consider plays keeping the J, but apparently that's what I should do here.  Best are either 9L AREA/ALAE.  Those plays win 89% and this wins 87, simming roughly 5 points down.
>Ed_Gowach: GU 7B .UG +14 181
>Jim_Burlant: AABCELR 9L ALBA +24 283
#note Without an O for ALBACORE, I felt my best tack would be to kill the L, M, N, and O columns since row 3 is only going to give back air balls.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Ed_Gowach: ??INPST 3D TurNIPS +63 244
#note Row 14 plays - INSWEPT, INKPOTS, INSTEPS, etc, score 71.  The stylish EPINaSTy 14B wins the sim but Ed's outlook is still bleak - even EPINASTY only wins 16% and this wins 13.
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEIRR 10I CRIED +20 303
#note Q wants me to build a rack - I'd rather turn as many tiles as I can, add a smidgen of resistance to row 11 (now, anything on row 11 has to have the N in second position) and end the game as quickly as possible.  Q wants me to play 14D IRE.  Pffft.

>Jim_Burlant: AEGIIUY N1 GUY +21 364
#note Terrible leave or not, my first priority was to ensure that Ed couldn't hit a miracle bingo on row 1.  Q wants me to play 4A AGUE.  I'd rather defend just in case.
>Ed_Gowach: EE F9 .EE +8 295
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIOVY 1L YA.I +36 400
#note Or VOYAGE 1J or YOGI.  While the 4's give up a lot of scoreboard points to VOYAGE, the II leave with VOYAGE takes away any advantage I gain.  The sim indicates VOYAGE, YOGI, YAGI are equally strong plays.  
>Ed_Gowach: ER B5 RE......... +16 311
>Jim_Burlant: EILNOTV 11D OL. +6 406
#note What can I say?  I haven't studied my phony 9-to-11 front extensions yet. :-p  Cute play, but LAMINATED doesn't take a front RE.  Now I know.
