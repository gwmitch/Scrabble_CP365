#note i didn't think of 9D VIBE here. BREVET is kind of a weird move and doesn't seem right. i suppose it's a bit more defensive but keeping that leave doesn't merit it, i think. (-3)

#note A Very Bad Move (tm).  something like15D OIDIA, for example, is already an improvement, or even K11 IVY. i also considered OHO/OOH at O6. if i was better, i'd find the neat 7L KAYO, or simply K11 OVOID. if i was awesome i'd see L9 HOOEY. (-9.5)

#note cool - C10 HEMOID or 14B HE. HOVE isn't too bad though. (-1.5)
>nick_meyer: ADOS O5 SODA +27 183
>cesar: EIIMNNU C9 MINUEN. +26 218
#note with the Q and the X out, this was still a risk i was willing to take. quackle thinks unmined might actually result in a slightly higher win %. this was a fun move, i'm glad it was this close because at the time i was sweating bullets. (-0.5)

#note the problem with cig is that it really doesn't do anything at all for me. my bingo is not going to fit next turn. it is kind of unfortunate and annoying that garlics or nothing fit, but i have to give myself a better chance of bingoing next turn then with something like E11 GLIDE. 10B CIGAR also adds that additional turnover for the blanks. other moves that look decent are B18 GAL or even J10 AGER and leave that spot open for a while. i was mostly way too paranoid about that spot. the other move i seriously considered was 10J CHANG. (-4.5)
>nick_meyer: AW 14A AW. +27 251
>cesar: AIILORS 11C .ORIA +13 243
#note my initial instinct of J10 OLEA sims better here. i wanted to try to kill (or mitigate) what i thought was a potentially worse scoring spot. (-2)
>nick_meyer: ELST N9 LETS +26 277
#note i'm in trouble
>cesar: EILNOSU 12A LO.SE +22 265
#note i started to get low on time here and didn't think of 9C MEOUS. actually, i don't think i was sure that MADS was a word. i hope i would have tried it. D7 ISOGON is also pretty damn awesome. LOUSE is much worse obviously. (-13.5)

#note ok. my winning chances are actually not awful here. can i PLEASE get a blank.
