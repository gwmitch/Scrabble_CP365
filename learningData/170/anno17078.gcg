#note Joel blocks SOMITAL, unwittingly. I was setting up MILIAS, which isn't a word. I'm surprised by that revelation. This is pretty likely the best play if I both of us accept MILIAS.

#note here's where it gets difficult. The pool is beautiful for Joel, but I really can't see how sacrificing points to block the lane he opened would ever work out. I missed 2L DAVY, which looks OK, and thought YAUD was crazy. I think I should have just gone for points here and played B13 ADZ (I considered it) 
>Joel_Horn: ALMNOR 2F NORMAL +27 376
#note Joel wouldn't have been happy had he not had all of the good, playable tiles in the pool, before and after this.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADTUUYZ 1G YA +26 384
#note -2, Joel was low on time and I thought this was my best chance given that I didn't want him to have time to figure things out. 
>Joel_Horn: BDEEINO 3C DEBONE +32 408
#note A ton of plays are better than this and a ton of plays win.
