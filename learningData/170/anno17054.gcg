>JD: AEGINSV 8G VIG +14 14
#note an interesting result, I thought that VIG would be more defensive than VAGI, but he has an A over 40% of the time. AENS also doesn't seem to be much of an upgrade over ENS.
>Jerry: AAOORUY -AOOUY +0 0
>JD: AAAELNS J8 AAL +13 27
#note to my surprise, going from AENS to AELNS raises my bingo percentage from 50% to 65% in this case. I also forgot about the AL synergy which makes AELS a little better than AENS.
>Jerry: AEMOORS K9 MOO +16 16
#note jerry missed the tricky saleroom on this play
>JD: ACDENSY H4 CYAN.DES +67 94
>Jerry: AEIIPRS 4D PIRA.IES +74 90
>JD: DEIIIRV 5B VIED +26 120
#note rather than being a smart setup, all I do is just cost myself a lot of bingo percentage. the board is open enough already.

>Jerry: EHLOOTU 5J THOU +26 201
>JD: EHIIMOQ M7 QI +23 203
#note I never know whether to play the Q first or not, after HEM for 40 I average 27 points next turn which means I probably draw enough plays (QUA or QIS or something) to make it worth holding off.

>Jerry: EEEGJLS 9C JEE +39 282
>JD: FINOTYZ N6 ZIT +46 289
#note didn't want to play ZIN because it seemed too easy to play at O8, being down 39 I need to take the chance. it may put pressure on him to block.
>Jerry: BEGLNSS O8 SEG +24 306
#note since he has both the remaining esses quackle says he really might as well leave O8 open - in fact, it may be impossible for me to block. even if I have the blank it won't be that easy for me to play there.
>JD: FGNOPUY 3E FOY +31 320
#note fungo flips over an extra tile, but FOY creates a PYA lane that is very unlikely to get blocked.
>Jerry: ABFLNRS 11C BAL +31 337
#note maybe flab to make bingos harder and take an extra chance at the blank?
>JD: ?BGNPTU 12I BUNG +20 340
#note again, holding on to row 2
>Jerry: FKNNORS F10 .KON +17 354
#note not sure what he should do, if he reads me as having the blank ikon is a nice idea, he could also try to outrun by playing FRONS at 2F.
>JD: ?AAENPT 2G PAgEANT +68 408
>Jerry: FINORSW 1K FOINS +37 391
#note best is awesome, if at 1M to set up sworn.
