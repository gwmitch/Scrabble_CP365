>Caesar_Jaramillo: BENO H7 BONE +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: DENOSUX 11H DOUX +32 32
#note Best. Next best option, I8 XU, wins almost 4% less often and sims 7-1/2 points down.   Of note:  I7 EXODUS.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: GOY I5 GOY +22 34
>Jim_Burlant: ELMNSUZ 10J MENU +31 63
#note I considered this and 12J  MULE, taking this for both the extra points as  well as setting up my S.  The duck says this is a very close call, but gives very slight preference to J6 MENU for 30, saying my choice wins 0.4% less often and sims 0.8 points down.  
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AGINNOS 10A ANGINOS. +63 97
#note Best bingo for Caesar is M4 ANGINOUS.   Caesar is 55% to win in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: ALLMNSZ A8 AZ.N +39 102
#note Hmmm.  I figured that between taking out the A column and scoring 39 points, grooming the rack would have to wait.  Quackle doesn't agree with this; the duck says I should play D9 ZILL for 26.  While I fully concede AMNS is a much stronger leave than LLMS, it wasn't too hard to imagine a lot of scenarios where leaving the A column alone for the sake of my rack would backfire if I had a bad draw and he had drawn something like EHVY.  Q says ZILL wins 44.8% and that this play (the runner up) wins 42.35 and sims 4.7 points down.  
>Caesar_Jaramillo: FORW J3 FROW +34 131
>Jim_Burlant: DELLMRS K5 DELL +26 128
#note I debated between this and M9 MULLED.  While MULLED clears the rack a little better, I didn't like floating the E and D, which would open up all sorts of plays on row 14.  While MULLED is a strong choice in its own right, Quackle agrees with me:  this is best by the slimmest of margins.  44.9% to win; MULLED wins 1/4% less often and sims 0.2 points down.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AIPT E7 PAI.T +14 145
>Jim_Burlant: BEIMRSV L1 VIBES +34 162
#note Counterintuitive to burn the S for 34 when there are plays that score within 7 points that keep it, but I felt that turnover and score justified the play.  I saw 8K LIVER but didn't like the BMS leave with the open vowels disappearing, and I thought plays like VIM F6 or 9D MIB gave up too much on the scoreboard. Yes, there's the S hook down the N column but that's my line of last resort; it's not like I'm giving up a wide open run at an S hook down the triple line. Quackle doesn't agree with me - it says I should play  F6 VIM and it hates this.  Maybe so, but this worked out better than if I'd played what the duck wanted.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: DEI 1L .IDE +24 169
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILMR F2 MALtIER +72 234
#note Hit the clock and realized the mistake:  I should have looked to do something about the B column.  B2 CLAIMER is best.  
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AQT B6 QAT +34 203
#note Small consolation:  My MALtIER error came out in the wash.  Had I played at B2 like I should have, he'd have played at F6 for 38. 
>Jim_Burlant: CEOOOPU 4B COUP.E +20 254
#note Missing LOUPE 8K.  I was concerned about the D or S hook with this, but with only one D out, I thought it was a risk I could take.  In reality, I needed to look harder to find LOUPE.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: DRTU H1 TURD +35 238
#note Of course.  At least he didn't have JEED in his rack. 
>Jim_Burlant: GOORSTY 12C GOY +25 279
#note Too much rack grooming - 12A STOGY!  Still in good shape though - 76% to win.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AHI C4 .HIA +22 260
>Jim_Burlant: EIJORST N7 JOISTER +75 354
#note Heh heh heh.   Best legitimate play is 13B JO.  This is bogus, but it sims 27 points better than any of my legitimate options.
