#note SOX is definitely an upgrade

>Jerry: BDEFNOR E7 B.RFED +28 54
>JD: AHILOPY D11 HIPLY +45 151
#note HIPLY at G5 sims a little better (somehow missed it) but I think it also allows plays at H1 that open the board a lot, so I don't mind my choice.

>JD: AGOTUWZ 14I AZO +34 185
#note wasn't sure exactly what to do here, TUG at K9 sets up an S hook I don't want to be there. OUTWAR at I10 is a pretty awesome play that I missed.

#note eugenol is the play I wanted here, this is my biggest miss so far. gotta flip over tiles and see the blanks, opening the lane on row 4 is not a big deal with two S hooks on the board.

#note I was happy to open the E and the triple line to see two more tiles and score the 10 points, but given that I'm standing with a 62 point lead I'm just giving an easy road back into the game. there are existing lines but none of them is nearly as good. just DUNT is fine.
>Jerry: ?EIOOSV O1 VOI. +24 231
#note just got lucky here that he didn't have it
>JD: AAIORST N11 STRIA +31 318
#note how often do you get to play this word? this play must get better the more I'm certain he has a blank. 
>Jerry: ??EIOST B7 cOzIEST +71 302
#note it may be best for him to play something less defensive so that he creates another lane over here.
>JD: AACFOPV 15M V.C +24 342
#note AVO/AVA might give me better tempo, I just wanted to get rid of some of my clunkers now.
>Jerry: ABEGIMM F10 AM +21 323
#note I think his only way of winning is to bingo, so maybe a play like BEAM at N3 to try to hit row 3.
>JD: AAAFNOP J2 PA. +11 353
#note from my perspective the only way I could lose was if he played BIGTIME or BHISTIE. quackle doesn't find the play that blocks both of these that I made here.
