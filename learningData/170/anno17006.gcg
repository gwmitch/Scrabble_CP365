#note INFANT.  Especially good since he might not know hooks.  I thought this was good since it set up my F.  FN or exchanging are also good choices.

#note Interesting call.  this play makes it likely I get my J for 60 next turn (JADE, JUDO).  But, if he takes that spot, the J kinda sucks.  Being down, this variance might be worth it.

#note Risky phoney.  It also sets up X/Q spots.

#note Sim likes 14F/H plays.  given his last play, He's got to have a bingoey or vowely rack.  I'd rather keep the hotspot open and get turnover.

#note LoL.  Play phoney, miss actual bingo.

#note Should probably take MOSQUE first.  But I figure there's a good chance he doesn't see it.
