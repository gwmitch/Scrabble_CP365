>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?ACINSU F8 CAUSINg +71 165
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEFITT 1A FITTE. +33 79
#note for some reason I thought she had blocked F(OR)TIETHS. I think I was more tired than I thought.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EFIW 11B WIFE. +22 187
#note there be a better spot for them tiles at I6
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABEHNT 12A BETA +35 114
#note I missed some more easy stuff here. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EILNORS 14I SONLIER +75 262
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EILNORS --  -75 187
#note So Terry missed (A)ILERONS/(A)LIENORS and the albeit more difficult find (P)ROLINES. I don't feel that bad anymore I guess. Or do I?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABHNOS E4 HOB +31 145
#note seemed like the obvious play, right? 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EILNORS I2 NEROLIS +80 267
#note Überoops. This game has been a mess. I could have blocked her options with a ridiculous play like IRES/SH. In my defense she took around 5 minutes to play SONLIER*. I don't think she would have seen anything she didn't see last time unless she ruined her time situation, which she wouldn't have done. What a comedy of errors. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ANNOPS 10A NAP +20 165
#note yeah I knew both of them 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EH 13B EH +35 302
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIINOS A3 ENvISIO. +74 239
#note maybe chance she challenges SINOPIE?
>Terry_Kang_Rau: DNO B6 DON +19 321
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGLRT J5 RATEL +22 261
#note no idea, hoping for RETAXING
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AK J2 KA +38 359
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNOORZ 1J ORGONE +34 295
#note ORZO and hope for the case I again?
>Terry_Kang_Rau: MTU 2M MUT +20 379
#note this was a hefty mistake that both Terry and I agree on, but nothing compared to my previous ones this game. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILYZ K3 GLEY +35 330
#note she dropped her T, I can now hopefully catch her with at least the Q. I just need to score enough. Best draw is obviously AO and I could possibly hope for SO and play (LA)ZY. Champ wants me to play ZAG but I felt that didn't work out unless I drew the A. Maybe not as Terry would have to sacrifice a ton to take the spot most of the time? Dunno, apparently this never wins. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ACGLQSV C3 VACS +22 401
#note she's supposed to play 14D GA(g). She also has other wins. She also also has no time to find them.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIJOZ 14D JI. +9 339
#note 11H AM(I), ZA/(AMI)A and JO/HOBO win the game. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: GLQ 6G .L... +8 409
>Joshua_Sokol: AOZ K9 AZO +26 365
#note I challenged ALLAY for free
>Joshua_Sokol:  (GQ) +24 389
#note What a game I would like to forget as soon as possible :(
