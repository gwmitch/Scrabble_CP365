#note 4F mIDS(T)ORY may have baited a challenge, and I had other playable valid words that I didn't see because I became too fixated on bingoing as soon as possible after laying down what I thought was going to be SORDIDLY through the I. I was really out of it.

#note I got away with one, why not another. He possibly doesn't know CAFTANS or if he does he may think this is another valid spelling. Nope.

#note I should play FACT. This draws only into NUTCASE and CINEAST with the setup, and I didn't bother to check that in my mind palace. Of course, I might be able to bingo with AJAR, but it's not something I should count on.

#note A(G)APAI would've been great to see. 1) It may have drawn a challenge, 2) it gives me a good shot if I prefer the win over spread.

#note A(U)KLET could have drawn a challenge, which could have given me a better chance than this, but that is too conditional of a factor.
