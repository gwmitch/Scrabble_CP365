#note My only lost challenge of this one-day. I didn't know it at all and he definitely played it with hesitancy- he's also rated in the low 1600's. So I challenged. Shame on me.

#note Spent a while here, saw all the options. I figure that it isn't smart to go for the equity options (POOL, POLIO, TOPOI) after his last few plays. But also this board is really open. I decide my best 'defense' is extreme turnover for the blanks. I want to continue play long in future turns so that eventually there isn't ay room on this board left. Quackle hates this, I don't.

#note Actual rack. Interesting move; he probably thinks he has good enough scoring tiles to block bingos and outrun me .
>Sid: ?GINORT N10 GRIsT +27 373
#note Took a while. This seems like my best bet- I need to block high scoring plays like KNISH and put myself in a position where an out-in-two won't be enough for him. This isn't foolproof, but there aren't any decent alternatives.

#note Several plays win here.. this does too, but it requires a hell of a find for his next turn!
>Sid: HLNOO M8 HOO +20 393
#note My best play.
>Game_6-_Schneider-_11/21/15: ANS 4K .ANS +14 384
#note The only way KELIM wins is by finding (E)N at f11, setting up an unblockable RAS/JEWS! Just VANS isn't enough. I lucked out. He also went over by a hair.
