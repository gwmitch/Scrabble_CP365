>Mike_Early: GOR 8G GOR +8 8
>Reid: AEGIRSU J5 AGUE +14 14
#note GARIGUES at G4 or G8 is #1, 3 (65.03 63.69)%. I didn't see SUGARIER at L4 for #2 (64.84%) until just before simulating this turn. I didn't see GARIGUES until after simulating with Quackle. This is a big mistake. My play is #3 based on valuations of all plays.
>Mike_Early: IMTT K2 MITT +16 24
>Reid: AAESTUX J1 TAX +27 41
#note EAUX at L5 is #1 (53.89%). AX at J2 is #2 (51.4%). XU at L1 is #3 (51.36%). My play is #6 (50.07%). I agree with Quackle here. This is a small mistake. I had considered XU, but wanted more points. I thought about #2, but the positioning was horrible. #1 is a good balance although I wanted to keep my E.
>Mike_Early: DDEPU K8 DUPED +25 49
>Reid: ABEFOSU L1 FUSE +41 82
#note #1 play. This is not my usual style, but I decided to take the points and try to pick up some early momentum. There are still plenty of esses out.
>Mike_Early: AIVV 7D VIVA +15 64
#note Mike misses the beautiful and rare VIVAT here at 1F.
>Reid: ABCJOOR 1F JABO. +42 124
#note #1 play.
>Mike_Early: BOOT 2D BOOT +21 85
>Reid: ACEOORY 3B COOEY +39 163
#note #1 play.
>Mike_Early: IQ -  +0 85
#note Mike exchanges 3 tiles here.
>Reid: AAEIRST 12H AIR.ATES +72 235
#note VARIATES at D7 is #1 (98.61%). I didn't see this play until just before simulation. ARISTAE at 9B and M4 is #2 (97.88, 97.65)%. My play is #5 (97.11%). This is a small mistake, but I strongly agree with Quackle.
>Mike_Early: IQ 13G QI +23 108
>Reid: ??EHINY O7 NEbbI.HY +86 321
#note #1 play. I spent quite a bit of time this turn trying to find a triple triple. CHIMNEYS, HYGIENES, THYMINES, HYALINES, ETHINYLS, and SHINNEYS are all tied for #1 (99.99%). I chose my play just for fun. I'll probably never play the word again in my life.
>Mike_Early: EIKNNRS 14E SKINNER +87 195
#note SKINNIER at E5 scores 98.
>Reid: DFILLLU 11E FULL +18 339
#note #1 play.
>Mike_Early: DEINW -  +0 195
#note Mike exchanges 4 here.
>Reid: AADEILL B3 .ADAILLE +65 404
>Reid: AADEILL --  -65 339
#note Tried to play a phony here. I was hoping that Mike would be too concerned about spread to risk a challenge. FAIL and FILA at 1L are tied for #1  with AXISED at 3I. Numerous others are tied for #2 and #3. The game is virtually over at this point.
>Mike_Early: DEINW 12B WIDEN +25 220
#note WIDEN at 10B scores 28.
>Reid: AADEILL 1L .AIL +21 360
#note AXISED at 31 is #1 (100.00%). AIL at I3 is #2 (99.87%). FILA is #3 (99.83%0. For some reason, my play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ even though it has the same leave, location, and letters as #3. Quackle, you crazy!! My play is #1 based on valuations of all plays.
>Mike_Early: HW 14M WH. +24 244
>Reid: ACDEEEL 13A CEDE +28 388
#note Numerous plays are tied for #1 (100.00%) because of the lopsided score. CEDE is one of these plays. It has the highest valuations of the ten plays tied for first. I also like CAWED at B10 because it blocks one of Mike's ensuing bingoes. I was focusing on balancing here for one last bingo. It worked out well.
>Mike_Early: EINOPRS 9B ORPINES +68 312
#note INCORPSE at B1 scores 86.
>Reid: AELNORT M5 TOLERAN. +60 448
#note #1 play. This catches Mike with the Z at the end.
>Reid:  (AGMRZ) +34 482
#note 7 of my 12 plays were #1. 9 of of 12 in the top 6. I still think two more of my plays were just fine, but Quackle didn't agree. I did play an unsuccessful phony and I missed a bingo to start. Overall, I give myself a C+/B-. I obviously outdrew Mike, but there was room for improvement.
