#note I strongly considered blocking column O first, it's easy for him to have a big scoring play, but I didn't like that the X played poorly on this board, so decided to cash it now. dead heat in the sim.
>Alastair_Richards: AORY 12D ROYA. +28 163
#note I'm surprised that he made this play blocking his ELAND hook, but he must not have had much of an alternative.

>JD: BEINOPV 8A BOVINE +39 338
#note tvery tough for him to come back from here, not many tiles in the bag and poor lanes.

>JD: CEOPTTU 1G TECTU. +30 368
#note a better play here is UPCOME#, a word I didn't know. there are very few low-point consonants left, so keeping TT, even though it duplicates, makes it way more likely to bingo if I draw the blank. I think either play makes it hard for me to lose.
>Alastair_Richards: EESVW E3 SWEVE. +24 281
#note nice play by alastair to open a bunch of new lanes and dump his worst letters.
>JD: AJOOPYZ 12K .OPAZ +52 420
#note I had actually mistracked and thought the bag was empty - I was missing the I. I saw the possibility of OECOLOGIC# and knew I should block, but the possibility of having mistracked and missing some bingo from the D was too dangerous, so I took the sure win with TOPAZ. The best spread play by far is JOYS at 3B which only leaves COOEEING for 60 for alastair. still, this is a sure win and better losing to a miracle row 15 play.
