#note fun word! probably BYREMEN# has a better chance of drawing a challenge if I knew it. happy to get a play on the board right away.
>Andrew_Golding: OPTU L4 POUT. +20 20
#note setting up an S hook in CSW
>JD: DEJLPTY J6 JE.LY +39 119
>Andrew_Golding: ?AISTWX 3G WAXIeST +117 137
#note ouch!! and here I thought I was off to a nice start. I felt certain enough about POUTY that I didn't challenge, but really with any inkling of doubt I should challenge.

>Andrew_Golding: AA 2G A.A +17 154
>JD: ADEINOT 5B ANTIDO.E +68 217
#note great draw, he blocked IODINATE for 80 but I still bingo.
>Andrew_Golding: AEEIINR D1 INER.IAE +70 224
>JD: FGIOORT C7 FOG +24 241
#note many plays sim close, but quackle likes FORGO at C7 to set up a scoring lane on row 12, since I keep the second-to-last T, and I turn over a bunch of new letters to draw scoring tiles.
>Andrew_Golding: IWZ 1G W.Z +43 267
>JD: AEIORST H8 .TAERIOS +77 318
#note more clutch drawing skills

#note nice job of opening the board
>JD: AEHHSUV 14A HUH +36 440
#note I saw VAUCH# at M9, but since I'm already holding one of the two esses myself, I felt content to leave it open and draw a big V play down column N hooking RUBRIC. even if he bingos, I will get counterplay on the triple word score lane, so I am in control.
>Andrew_Golding: DOV 1A OV..D +27 340
>JD: AADESSV 13C SAV +24 464
#note well, now I have both of the esses, so I can take my time and groom a bingo on column N for a couple of turns and there's little he can do. I also saw VISAED at 13G, but the pool didn't look great, and I wanted the time to fish multiple times if necessary.
>Andrew_Golding: BE K5 BE +26 366
#note was looking at that spot for a long time, but no good plays ever fit
>JD: ACDEGSU E11 GU. +14 478
#note I can play the same tiles for 6 more points! missed the CSW hook
>Andrew_Golding: I B5 .I +4 370
#note his actual rack here was TOILING.
>JD: ACDEQRS 6A Q. +11 489
#note his last play strongly suggested an unplayable -ING bingo, well worth sacrificing 10 points to block.

#note a good morning!
