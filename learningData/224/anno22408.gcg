#note Maybe I should have played 6B YE, but this brought me in contention without the need for a bingo, but with a bingo leave. Choose your poison.

#note Missing 11C J(O)OK, which looks right. I couldn't decide if I really needed the case S to win this game, so I decided not to pull the trigger on F10 JOI(N)T. I also longly considered 10F JOT. That leaves more stuff open. It looked like Craig had no considering to do on his end, as he was not shuffling tiles as per the usual, so where was he going to play? Probably in the area of where I would play JOT. This is a considerable mistake if that is the case.
>Craig_Rowland: RTZ 10C R.TZ +33 347
#note And it was.
>Joshua_Sokol: DENSTUU 10J TEND +28 327
#note I was starting to get frustrated here, even though I drew the S which was extremely useful, and I couldn't find a way to get rid of both of my U's, so I decided to go for the Q. I cannot believe that I missed D2 (K)UDU. Crushing mistake.
>Craig_Rowland: GQTV -QVGT +0 347
>Joshua_Sokol: EEISUUX 1N EX +32 359
#note I should hold off here and play N9 (R)UE(S). Tough play to find and think about, but I'm supposed to be good at that.
>Craig_Rowland: AEILNOW D2 .NOW +22 369
>Joshua_Sokol: EGISTUU F2 .UG +11 370
#note I missed TENDU this turn too, even though I was aware of it when I played TEND. That's 4 points, although I'm preventing many of his bingos, so perhaps this is better anyway.
>Craig_Rowland: E K9 ..E. +10 379
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMSTUV B12 V.U +12 382
#note Demolished. His last play was just crushing. I can't win unless he just drew the Q and/or I draw the blank. Thought it was much much more likely that he drew the Q (it's obviously equal or greater than 33.333_%, whereas him having the blank is so much more likely than him not having it. Anyways, this looks grim, but this is definitely my play. I cannot win without drawing into a bingo here that he can't block. The worst part of this turn was knowing how unlikely it was that I could win. Perhaps I have a better chance if I play M12 (R)EV. Maybe he can't block and win at the same time.
