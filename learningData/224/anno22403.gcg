#note I chose the right angle here. Against Ross I have this particular sense that allowing him to score isn't as bad as it would be for some players, as he is defensive, so he doesn't really like forced plays, such as taking a triple word score.

>Joshua_Sokol: GIMOOUZ C10 .OOM +16 206
#note This is a really cool position, because I feel like no one would agree on what to do here. Some would exchange keeping the Z, some would exchange everything, some would exchange all but OU (I was fishing for OUT(VOTED) beginning with my OAF play). Some would play OUZO at B12 or C12 because they crave aggressiveness, some would play M(ARIA) for various reasons... I played TOOM because it doesn't take an S, and so that part of the board is not going to be easy to reopen. It also blocks the best bingo letter on the board, the R. Ross might also think that it does take an S.

>Joshua_Sokol: GIIOSUZ 1C .I +3 209
#note I was feeling really good about this. There goes an easy way to open the board or pull ahead for Ross. And this could scare the crap out of him too. It seems like I am very strong when I make this fish!

#note I will not open this board up unless I really really feel like Ross is displaying weakness.

#note Nooooo!! I made a mistake here! Damn it! I saw POZOLE earlier. That's the play at 5G. Augh. I was playing this game better than well. I inferred that Ross could not respond to this since he was fishing for something particular. Turns out he was. I think he had SQUEET or something.

#note Play more tiles! 2J BUT is not correct! He can't hit me, he's still fishing.
>Ross_Brown: EN 5J EN +20 259
#note This basically sealed the game. If he bingos here and draws into another bingo miraculously, I could lose. But now there aren't enough tiles in the bag.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDFOSTY 7K FOYS +27 380
#note YUPON! Damn it, another mistake, I have COSY for 42. But I can make those now, I held off long enough. Although this cuts his chances by a lot. A whole lot.
