#note all of my best options burn the S. I liked how defensive the board shape was all of a sudden
>Evan_Cohen: MOZ L2 MOZ +53 70
>JD: AGMNPRX N2 PAX +47 158
#note evidently GNPR bingos a couple of % more than GMNR on the subsequent board, but the diff is small.

>JD: EFGNRSV C5 REVS +23 211
#note amazingly, I played YET ANOTHER unchallenged phony on this turn. to me SKITTING* looked like the scariest potential lane on the board. even if he challenges, I at least gain the knowledge that he cannot bingo there! I also liked that REVS set up the possibility of GANEF/GANOF, reasonable draws given the vowel-heavy pool. Decent real plays are FEW at 5K or FUNG at 5D. I'm alright with my choice.

#note a spread error, NIDI keeps the vital R and much increases my chance of bingoing. I was out of time and didn't look for an alternative.
>Evan_Cohen: IOTU B10 .UOIT +28 257
>JD: EEIIRRS 12G REI +11 429
#note I was excited to potentially bingo, but the plays on column A score so much potentially that I really should sacrifice my leave to block! Q suggests an S- play across on row 15 like SIREE, maximizing my chance of grabbing the blank. a non-intuitive spread play. if I do want to fish, TI at 14C is a reasonable try since it also blocks.
>Evan_Cohen: AWY 13E WAY +24 281
#note he can also play DEAWY for 12 more, but that blocks row 15 and row 13 bingos which is possibly why he didn't choose that.
>JD: EEHIORS A12 HOER +46 475
#note I missed my bingo on this play, but it's actually almost certainly the wrong play - NOSHERIE# sets up a number of massive 100+ point J bingos that don't play otherwise. I have to block 70+ point J??? plays and play here
>Evan_Cohen: ?EIPSTV 13I SPaVIET +77 358
#note unfortunately for me the J was the last tile, so I lose almost 100 spread. but if I hadn't stupidly tried RIGIDIST* I probably would've bingoed again and garnered way more spread!
