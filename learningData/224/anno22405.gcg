#note Normally I would just play I5 VOWS here, but this exchange seemed rather strong. I much preferred not to leave the H8 M there for the rest of the game, and also I didn't want to leave it up to me to draw an A soon to be in control of the game (AVOWS). I did all the probabilistic calculations and VOWS was definitely stronger, but I put a lot of emphasis on my board!
>Lydia_Keras: DEIL 9F LIED +18 37
>Joshua_Sokol: ANORSTT 10F ATTORNS +78 112
#note I wasn't 100% on RATTONS. That's probably a sliver better
>Lydia_Keras: HIT L10 .HIT +14 51
>Joshua_Sokol: ADNORRV 6B VAR +23 135
#note And now Josh teaches himself to eat his own words. I definitely preferreed 6B NARD positionally, especially cause I was keeping the V in my arsenal for future board control. But this time I went with the numbers, which indicate that DNOR and projection 1 (after VAR) was favorable to me than projection 2 (after NARD). DORN is definitely a better leave for scoring more than Lydia this game, but not a better leave for forcing Lydia to have far fewer scoring opportunities. How do I resist zipping up the top of a board at this point?
>Lydia_Keras: ETVX 5D VEXT +38 89
#note See Lydia's previous play. Not that this doesn't score 36 at 14K, only 2 fewer. But now the board is not really under my control. At all. I don't know if she knows that SHITE is now a word though...
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGOQRS 12K Q. +11 146
#note Another possibility is exchange 2? I bingo with ADGLSU next turn (I wouldn't play CODGERS since I didn't know it) after Q(I). My chances of a bingo next turn are twice as high if I exchange 2. And she just played VEXT, which indicates not a very strong rack most of the time, so reducing her chances by 5% and scoring 11 just won't cut it. MISTAKE. 
>Lydia_Keras: AISW 13I WAI.S +35 124
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGJORS 14F GORED +27 173
#note Oh do my mistakes cost me this game. This was also a mistake probably. But what do I play instead? Everything SUCKS. :( I guess just JO 12H? Ugh.
>Lydia_Keras: AEEIY 15E AIYEE +44 168
#note UGH!

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACDELN 4G uNLACED +71 322
#note I should be in a favorable position here but I'm not. I just know I'm not. I played this to reduce her chances of bingo-ing, as S(UT) is invalid. ENLACeD scores 1 more, but gives back far more in terms of bingos.
>Lydia_Keras: ?EINOPS 3C SENOPIa +82 329
#note -4 to SiNOPIE. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGILRZ 2H ZAG +31 353
#note Now what? I should still be in good shape. I actually did think I was at this point. I draw a U and I might be able to play LURID 2B
>Lydia_Keras: BFO 2D FOB +31 360
#note Nope.
>Joshua_Sokol: DILRRRU K4 .URR +12 365
#note Hello worst possible draw! I am completely screwed now. Wow. Maybe I need to play 3L DIRL. But I lose anyway. I should have hesitated to play this since it turns out Lydia didn't know this could be spelled with two R's, and she was about to hold.
