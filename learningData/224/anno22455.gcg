>JD: ACLNRSY 8G CLY +16 16
#note I was about to become part of the Jakkrit buzzsaw...17 wins in a row including main event and after-tournament!
>Jakkrit: AEFNRRT -AEFNR +0 0
>JD: AEEINRS G2 RESIAN.E +63 79
#note INCREASE opens multiple scoring spots, which quackle likes versus the one huge spot after RESIANCE
>Jakkrit: AFO F4 OAF +31 31
>JD: BEIPQVY 7I BEVY +25 104
#note PRIVY sets up the cheap Q dumpoff for 33 next turn, and also gives back much fewer points. in this case it would've really helped
>Jakkrit: AEFGNOT 2F F.ONTAGE +72 103
#note I also would've blocked his next bingo, as it turns out, so too bad for me that I didn't choose PRIVY.
>JD: DINPQUU 1H PIU +31 135
#note I saw QUIPOS but decided to cover the big 1H scoring spot first. that said, holding the Q for another turn is poor, because there are no great spots for it. should've taken advantage of being able to dump it this turn.
>Jakkrit: ?ADNOOR H8 .ADROONs +79 182
>Jakkrit: ?ADNOOR --  -79 103
#note a lucky break that he didn't spell this right, AND that he didn't know FRONTAGER#!
>JD: DHLNQUV 5D QU..L +28 163
#note should really hold the Q one more turn and not open the Q, but I wasn't thinking about what I was giving him...
>Jakkrit: ?ADNOOR D5 .uADROON +88 191
>JD: ADHLNTV M1 V.LDT +18 181
>Jakkrit: OX E10 OX +38 229
>JD: AEHIKNN 8L ANKH +42 223
#note I saw HANKIE but couldn't convince myself that it was good (also good in TWL).
>Jakkrit: AILORU 1A OURALI +26 255
>JD: EIINPTW C11 WIPE +33 256
#note PEWIT wins a sim by 4 points over WIPE, but I'm not positive that it's really better if jakkrit plays reasonably. either play is a big gamble, but also significantly better than my other choices.
>Jakkrit: JW 14B J.W +26 281
>JD: BDEINTU 8A BUN. +21 277
#note quackle's favorite play here is DEBUT at 15C, which is too crazy for my taste. if I'm going to make a fishy move like BUND then quackle prefers URB/BOX to keep an even stronger leave. There are also 3 more Ts in the bag, so quackle likes BUNDTover BUND.
>Jakkrit: MM F9 MM +27 308
>JD: ADEIITT 15A TAD +32 309
>Jakkrit: CEEHSTZ N6 ZE. +36 344
>JD: EEIIIST 14B ...IE +17 326
#note JEWIE makes it hugely likely that jakkrit will bingo (from 25% up to 50%) but keeps a fairly weak leave of EIIST in the process. instead, quackle suggests either VIE at top-right or TEIID, biding my time and trying to bingo on a very closed board. I'm ok with TEIID now, although my chances are poor either way.
>Jakkrit: AEGGIRT 15F TAGGIER +82 426
>Jakkrit: ?CDEHOS (challenge) +5 431
#note it felt unlucky at the time, but this bingo wouldn't have played without JEWIE - hence the merit of a play like TEIID
>JD: AEIISTT N2 SAI +37 363
>Jakkrit: ?CDEHOS 13E SHOCkED +71 502
>JD: EEIRSTT 9J TIRES +32 395
#note TREES prevents him from overlapping IRONE on row 10.
>Jakkrit: EINOR 10H IRONE +20 522
>Jakkrit:  (ET) +4 526
#note I had plenty of chances early to try to extend a lead, but once the game was even I was never able to get the type of play I needed to get ahead.
