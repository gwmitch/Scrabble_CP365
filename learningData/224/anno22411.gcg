#note Seriously, top 600 probability double doubles to start off two of my four first games this tournament.

>Joshua_Sokol: EGGNOST 10E GO +14 108
#note This turn was quite bizarre. It seems so difficult to quantify how aggressive I need to be here. I could play either (N)OGG for maximum offense (I11 or 6K). I11 looks best between the two as it's tougher to block and scores one more point. But then I could just play 10E GO to keep things under control and aggressively shape the board. I could play J5 GOT to do the same to a lesser extent, bingo less, but get myself out of more sticky draw situations. In the end I think I made a mistake of not playing NOGG, but I could also keep my lead and not fish by playing E(R)GOTS or G(R)EGOS for 27 at 8J.

#note Be afraid, be very afraid of fishing. It puts you in this mindset that you have to bingo as soon as possible. Keep CENTS over CENS, don't even consider playing more than two tiles! This was a clear mistake. I should just stop right now and play 12A GENET or GENETS, and/or I should just play 12C GET.
>Deen_Hergott: ?AEOQRT J1 EQuATOR +95 206
#note Deen hesitated to play this, since he was 0-7 against me in our recent tournament games and that creates this psychological paranoia about any play you make. If Deen looked back at this position he would be like "why did I even hesitate here". But you get afraid. Fortunately I think this curse will not last.

#note I overdraw after my bingo, Deen sees IIT, gives me back II.

#note Very interesting to compare this with N8 (I)DEATiVE for 76. IDEATIVE gives back a ton more, and I think this ended up working out better for Deen, but normally I would say IDEATIVE is correct.
>Joshua_Sokol: AALLSUX L12 AXAL +30 294
#note My first concrete mistake of the game. I missed H8 (OVOID)ALS. That's safer and leaves me with the firepower I need to score well for the rest of the game. The X is a luxury at this point.

#note Boy, after the best draw I could ever hope for of PIE, I was so devastated to see my ticket out of this game ripped to shreds. PUNTIES was blocked! But I sucked it up, knowing I was too lucky to deserve PUNTIES, and checked out this pre-endgame. My analysis showed that this play was easily my winner, as PSI at M11 emptied the bag, and this left one unseen. The leave I was keeping was much better for the endgame, as outs in two will score and be easy to find and hard to counter. And heck, maybe once in a while I might bingo out. I looked at the pool, and saw that Deen could play something at 14K like BAMS and keep his vowel, but I was far enough ahead that that didn't seem to factor in the equation. I had so much time to keep looking. M11 PSI was definitely my best play, as counterintuitive as it seems at first, and I instantly knew why.
>Deen_Hergott: BFLMNRS 14K L.MBS +39 437
#note Wham, bam, alakazam, there goes my ridiculous streak against Deen. I completely missed that he could pluralize VENDEtTA too. Wow.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINSTT 15B SECT +22 425
#note The A was in the bag, but that didn't matter. I had lost. I almost ran out of time, so I didn't end up finding the best endgame, but I knew it was all lost. -5 to 13E TINS
>Deen_Hergott: AFNR I6 FAR +20 457
#note -3 to 14G RAN, blocking my ut.
