>Tony_Leah: FOORY 8H ROOFY +30 30
#note I'm sure I've looked this up before and seen it was only ROOFIE in twl. It even looked funny. ugh.
>Jackson_Smylie: BCEEILR 7E CELEB +22 22
#note I think LIB is the play I was looking for. I wanted something to really close off the board - I was not a fan of a FEBRILE or BELIEF board against Tony.

I think I was too quick to discount the board-opening plays. FIBER or FEBRILE are worth playing. I didn't know BEERILY, but probably would have played that actually. Also BRIEF. One of those turns where a lot of things are right, but I think LIB or FICE or something work best against Tony. CELEB is only a couple points down on Q. I wasn't a big fan, opening the scoring spot there.

#note VIPER is fine here. KIPA looked weird, but I figured it must be a word.

#note Doesn't make a great lane or anything, but puts some pressure on with the A hook and the S lane.

#note hope is not lost
>Tony_Leah: AEGILNY A6 AGLY +29 407
#note he said he considered YAWL. AGLY looks better, but DEY for 24 looks like it might be best.
>Jackson_Smylie: AOORRTU 14L ROO +11 346
#note I wanted to keep the A for aboil, but really that's only good for QUEAN. I'm probably looking at drawing some vowels. ARTU can hit OUTRAISE, OUTRAGES, OUTEARNS, OUTRANGE. ORTU can hit just OUTSNORE (from the O that is). Q likes OAR but I'm not convinced. That being said, the chance that Tony has the N or G or both is fairly high (I imagine he didn't have JQ). I'm looking at a long shot here.
