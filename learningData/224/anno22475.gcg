#note I saw the word DONABLE and recognized it as a word I knew, but not from Scrabble. I concluded it must be CSW. But it's not! Not sure where I learned it, but it seems like it should be good

#note Blech. I hated this play immediately after I did it. Gives too much back for not enough in return. H13 HOG scores 29 and gives me an ING to bingo to.

#note Hmm... My leave is a bit vowel-heavy to be relying on that G-column ING bingo, but what else can I do? K4 GOO is an option, since it's a little harder for Phil to close all the lines. There's also M8 BEANO. I don't hate my play, and don't really love any of the alternatives. So I dunno.

#note Considered playing JEHU to block that spot, but it can't be worth all that equity sacrifice.

#note SHVITZER*... I thought about it. 15B SHIVE is close to this

#note Ran out of time here, but SEVICHE is the play I wanted to find. VIEW is not that much worse, since it gives me a chance to bingo back if Phil has an unlikely AQUIFERS or TEQUILAS or something.
