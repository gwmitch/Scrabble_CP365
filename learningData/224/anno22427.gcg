>Andrew_Goodwin: ADELY H8 DELAY +26 26
>JD: EINOORT G8 OO +9 9
#note I liked the defensive properties of OO at G8, but I also prevent myself from hitting a high scoring bingo to the D, so Q prefers OO at I12.
>Andrew_Goodwin: BEE I11 BEE +15 41
>JD: EINRSTU F8 TRIUNES +68 77
#note I liked the relatively defensive board shape after a fishy play on his part. quackle agrees if I infer a leave like ES.
>Andrew_Goodwin: ALW J10 LAW +22 63
>JD: AAAFGRU E9 FAG +29 106
>Andrew_Goodwin: AIV K8 VIA +8 71
#note he really struggled to make this play. he can play VIAE for 6 more, so was he trying to block?
>JD: AABLQRU 13A BARQU. +34 140
#note I missed BURQA, but this actually sims better even though it's 3 points less - seems to be in part because of my decent chance of hitting -ABLE triple-triples with 8 Es left to draw, evidenced by the much higher standard deviation after BARQUE
>Andrew_Goodwin: EIMU A11 IM.UE +36 107
>JD: AAIILRT 8J A.ITAL +30 170
#note I'm surprised I had no confusion at the time between AVITAL# and AVIRAL*. The trick is that the CSW hook to VIRAL is on the back, for VIRALS# (VITALS is already good in both dictionaries). Good mnemonic I hope!
>Andrew_Goodwin: ?ADEIOS O1 SOrEDIA. +77 184

>JD: FLNOTTY 4K FLYT. +22 279
>Andrew_Goodwin: CGIKNOS 1H SOCKING. +98 308
>Andrew_Goodwin: CGIKNOS --  -98 210
#note he thought long and hard about trying this, and I can't blame him for giving it a shot since it's so much, but he had the real bingo of COKINGS# which I didn't know!
>JD: DENOORT 14I TONED +35 314
>Andrew_Goodwin: CGIKNOS 3M KI. +32 242
#note the I is a vital tile for him to keep here if he doesn't find his bingo, just KY at M3 sacrificing 12 points surely gets him further. Drawing an E for COGNISE afterward threatens a 100-point and 89-point bingo!

#note fishing for GRECISE#/CRINGLE on row 5 and also GRECIAN# on column C. Drawing the H gives me SCREIGH# which I didn't know.
>Andrew_Goodwin: EEGRV 5G VERGE +28 336
>JD: ?CEGHIR 3B GRInCH +41 472
#note I left 70 points on the table by not knowing SCREIGH# here.

#note he tried to play me for time here
