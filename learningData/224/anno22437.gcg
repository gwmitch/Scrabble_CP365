#note FAINTIER is the better play, but not worth risking bc I wasn't 100% on its validity.

#note should take the extra points for RIZA, EIRRSU doesn't actually bingo that much and doesn't score very well unless I draw the bingo.

#note I saw AVID and VIDE, but it seemed like a big priority to try to pull one of the big remaining power tiles, and VAGGED creates a J spot if I draw it that could immediately flip the game in my favor (I'm only 25% to win at the moment). Chris may even sacrifice a lot of points to block should he think I already have the J.

#note the plan couldn't have worked any better, I come down with the J and X. the blank is still out there and chris will probably win if he bingos, but fortunately the board is tight. JEELS on this turn blocks a more probably quadrant of the board, but it's hard to resist saving the H for J10 if I draw an A, and I may get JEELS next turn anyway.

#note now I'm in great shape, all the bingo lanes are gone except for 9s on column A.

>JD: BDEHW E9 WEB. +34 499
#note given how well I drew down the home stretch, probably VIDE and VAGGED both would've worked out for me, but I still think that was the move that triggered my comeback.
