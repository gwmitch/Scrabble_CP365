#note This game was already so boring. I really should have just fished for ROOIBOS/SPAWNER or BOO(K)S(T)ORE with 9E M(I). Also UROBOROS if he gives me an R or a U, but I had not studied that one!

#note M7 M(OI)STLY was a consideration of mine but it just makes no sense to give up my S here. The S is so important for this board.

#note well, I guess I should have played MOISTLY since I drew another S. Here the play is not COIL, but COIN. Happy I'm finally running into a decent amount of leave evaluation mistakes.
