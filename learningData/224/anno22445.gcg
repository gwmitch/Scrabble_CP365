>Komol: DDEENPR F7 P.NDERED +70 70
>JD: ACEEIIU 12D AU.EI +12 30
#note Q says not worth sacrificing so many points to keep the C - Q's favorite is GAUCIE for 6 more. In fact, my bingo percentage is the same keeping CEI and EI on this board.
>Komol: BINY 11B INBY. +34 104
>JD: CEEIIJL C9 JI. +18 48
#note Q says to take the points for JEEL - JIN does produce a better leave, but not 9 points better.
>Komol: EEFII I5 FEI.IE +11 115
>JD: ACEEILM 5E MALE.IC +56 104
#note I was really proud to come up with this play on a turn with a lot of good options, but unfortunately I didn't know the CSW hook...
>Komol: AEGLTW L1 TALWEG +37 152
>Komol: CHMY (challenge) +5 157
#note until the next turn, when I was horrified to see komol put the E on the end! he saw my expression of dismay and realized what must've happened, and we both started cracking up on the way back from the challenge computer.

>Komol: ORTV N10 VOT.R +32 243
>JD: ?BGNOSS 15H GiBSONS +89 314
#note at first I thought komol was about to play VOTED and block my bingos entirely, but instead it looks like I'm in good shape...also I didn't know OBSIGNS# which is 3 extra points
>Komol: ?DEORSU 3A DElUSOR. +74 317
#note he spent a good amount of time on this move. I still have tempo, but the game will be close.
>JD: AAIKLOZ D1 ZO.K +54 368
#note decent - quackle slightly prefers moves that save the Z for next turn like KAHAL#, KOHA# or KOALA. I almost played KOALA since it sets up the Z for next turn, while ZOUK may just give him back easy points. all within a couple of points on the sim though.
>Komol: EOTW 1A TOW.E +51 368
>Komol: HLOT (challenge) +5 373
#note wasn't totally sure about TOWZE# being good, seemed worth a challenge.
>JD: AAAAILT M1 ALA +14 382
#note drawing two more As was not quite what I was hoping for. I can dump 3 of them with ALAAP at 7B, but quackle actually really likes my move: there are only 4 more vowels left in the pool and 12 consonants, so my AAIT leave should balance out nicely. Finally, keeping the I is great because it lets me play QI at K12 if I draw it.
>Komol: HLOT J10 HOL. +28 401
>JD: AAFIRTV J5 .F +26 408
#note playing short lets me dodge the Q, and I have a 4/10 chance of drawing a bingo on column N - even if he blocks there, he may give me plays back on the triple line.
>Komol: OPQ H7 Q.OP +36 437
#note unlucky that he had such a high-scoring play with the Q
>JD: AAIRRTV N1 VAR +27 435
#note all of my good plays at N1 give back massive counterplay (including ANENST to go out!!), but I ran out of time to find an alternative course. best is AIRT at 13A threatening VARA to go out, but also saving VAR at N1.
>Komol: AENNST O1 SENT +44 481
>JD: AIRT 14B TRIA. +12 447
#note low on time. TIAR/AIRT/RAIT is 1 more. I was right in this until the end - finding my best endgame, not challenging TOWZE and playing OBSIGNS would've won me the game! But still, I am happy with my effort on a tough series of racks.
