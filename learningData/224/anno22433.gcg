#note terrible idea! I kind of knew that RESPONSA didn't take the E, so why would I try it here, other than some desire for stylishness? surely the right play is PORAE# to open the bottom anyway. Playing PATERERO at G6 doesn't even give all that much back in counterplay, or EPHORATE.
>Cameron_Farlow: IX F10 XI +52 176
>JD: ?AEEOPR H11 PAREO +31 102
#note now that I have forced myself to be down 100, would rather hold the blank in hand for a bigger potential bingo

#note DUGOUT to H1 opens more valuable lanes and gives back fewer points.

#note PEROGI# looks like a much more creative way of opening some threats on this largely moribund board.

#note good lord, I looked in no way, shape or form like the player I had been yesterday during the course of this game. I really don't know what I should do by this point, but this probably isn't it. GASHER at 12F to try to keep the triple-triple open? DIGGER to open a second 3x3? PEGGIER?
>Cameron_Farlow: Q 4C Q. +11 412
>JD: AEHIKRZ 14F ZE. +32 303
#note WAZ is 4 more at D8. ohterwise, a reasonable try is NIKAH# at 2J, with some notion of drawing the last Z for a massive SZ bingo on column O (though he will probably just block by playing at 1M).
>Cameron_Farlow: BDELN K7 BLEND +21 433
>JD: AHIKNRR 8K .AKIN +30 333
#note too early to give up! why not DRINK at 3J threatening a SH- bingo for 100 points? I played like I had already lost.
>Cameron_Farlow: DEFY N6 DE.FY +24 457
>JD: AHOORRS 4G .HO.RS +30 363
#note finally a decent play. this is best
>Cameron_Farlow: AABILVY 15C YABA +21 478
>JD: ALOR 13K LOR +20 383
#note I was out of time but had some notion of taking away VUG and leaving him with no V play.
>Cameron_Farlow: ILV 12G V.. +6 484
#note since he missed VIVO# this worked out better for me than going out.
>JD: A 7D A. +7 390
#note missed VAE/AR for 3 extra. In my defense, my racks weren't the easiest, but I really put up a poor effort in the first game of the day on several mornings day 2-4. I wasn't sleeping all that great, and it shows in my play. some anxiety this time around, worlds is still relatively new and exciting.
