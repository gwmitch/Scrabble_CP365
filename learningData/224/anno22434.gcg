#note I was a tad uncertain about this, and it must've shown in my body language. intriguingly, the 8D placement sims equally because it really restricts the quality of his scoring plays in response.

#note still some cobwebs in the brain from not sleeping well. took me a while to find my best bingo here.

>JD: ACJNPPT 4A PAP +32 169
#note I thought about playing JAP, but there are so many huge plays threatened at the top-right that I felt that I needed to try to playing there and delay playing my J for one more turn. But PAP still leaves a scoring spot with the hook at D1 for PAPA/PAPE, and JAP cleans up the J which is the best obstacle to a decent rack.

#note fortunate not to have my spot for JINX blocked, the alternative was probably to hold JX and play CLOP or even exchange

#note I didn't hesitate too much on this play because it's a lot better than my alternatives, but it's also not a word! He didn't hold.

#note he has column N to play bingos, but I figured I would take out some of the 8 lanes since he's been fishing for a few turns.

>JD: EHILMOT G13 OH +22 486
#note I ran out of time here. HYLISM# at L7 is an awesome word I didn't know! if I still expect him to be close to a bingo, I like making a short play so that he's less likely to draw an out, but probably OM is the play to save the H for 12L.

#note I only had a few seconds and saw that I had to block CRURA - MELEE is a slightly better way of doing this (4 better)
