#note This game was ridiculous, but I won it anyway.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDPRRR H7 P.RC +8 8
#note I don't know why I played this. I knew it wasn't right.
>Lydia_Keras: EEGHN 11H HENGE +30 58
#note Oh, right, PERC takes an H. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADERRT D2 pREDRA.T +72 80
#note Don't even talk to me about this. hahaha, I hoped she would challenged/hook an S later. But I first looked for 2x2s and didn't see anything.
>Lydia_Keras: AEY I7 AYE +30 88
#note I am certain I have brought up the word FUDGE in Zyzzyva before, and yet I did not have the cojones to challenge.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHNNOR L8 HON.R +24 104
#note 5B BO(D)HRAN! For some reason I had decided I wanted a wide open board this time with few scoring spots. But what is worse, M9+O8 as scoring spots or O8+O15 after HORN?
>Lydia_Keras: DOY M9 YOD +33 121
#note I am certain I have brought up the word HENGE---you get the point. I am chicken.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEILNW F5 WIN.ABLE +72 176
#note Scored as 73. Really was going mad with not giving her any scoring spots... 5A is 78, but

>Joshua_Sokol: ADILMOO K2 MODIOLA +75 315
#note LOL. I didn't take long enough to realize that I was also thinking of MOVIOLA. I knew MODIOLI was the plural of MODIOLUS, but it didn't seem like I was making this up. That's because I didn't see MOVIOLA.

#note My only not full rack of the tournament. Not like it's needed. I only had the A as a consonant, so I wanted to keep it just in case and not play VINA
