#note Umujose has an unusually fast-paced style that takes some getting used to!

>JD: AAEEIRS 10C AA +18 240
#note might as well play ZAIRE for 10 extra points, EEIRS is not that strong of a leave.
>Emmanuel_Umujose: BBDEIN M6 NIBBED +22 191
>JD: AEEHIRS 14D HAE +21 261
#note for the second turn in a row, ZAIRE is a better play than the one I made.

>Emmanuel_Umujose: DEENRV N2 NERVED +31 259
>JD: DEINORS O7 SORDINE +81 358
#note I didn't know the ENERVED hook, which could've been extremely costly
>Emmanuel_Umujose: AEEHNSV 1J HEAVEN +50 309
>Emmanuel_Umujose: IMQU (challenge) +5 314
#note his last letter was the S! fortunate it didn't fit, I also gave him the +5
>JD: EGGKPTX M13 KEG +30 388
#note I didn't play the X on this turn because GGPT seemed to have very high disaster potential, whereas I should be able to score well with the X. quackle disagrees a bit, which is fine
>Emmanuel_Umujose: IMQU 2G QUIM +34 348
>JD: GPRSTTX H1 T.X +30 418
#note TUX completely prevents him from bingoing, which is ideal
>Emmanuel_Umujose: WY F6 W...Y +27 375
#note surprised he didn't just play WART to set up SWART, although his rack may not have had much of a chance anyway
>JD: GIPRSTU 11A T.G +17 435
#note I didn't want to risk SWARTY being good when I didn't absolutely need to, so I played elsewhere.
>Emmanuel_Umujose: ?FINSS 3F FI. +26 401
>JD: IPRSU 15M .UP +18 453
#note again, trying to play it really safe.
>Emmanuel_Umujose: ?NSS 2G ....S +18 419
>JD: IRS 5F SIR +15 468
>JD:  (?NS) +4 472
#note he was like "why didn't you play SWARTY to begin with if you knew it was good?" but I think it was right given my uncertainty.
