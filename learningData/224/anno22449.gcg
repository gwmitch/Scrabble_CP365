#note gahh, my first missed TWL bingo of the tournament, and an easy one at that. fortunately the nonbingo play is almost as good, probably why I didn't look that hard for the bingo in the first place.

#note I'm sort of glad that he blocked the spot for UMWHILES* so I wouldn't try it (just UMWHILE# is good). both UM and LEW sim a little better. I think UM is a little too aggressive. IMSU seems to score better next move than EISW, but GLUM seems to lead to a better bingo leave long-term.

#note YAE sims a little bit better at 13K because of the clunkiness of EEER - YAE also sets up potential good V plays on row 14. I didn't like YAE because it opens a good bingo lane on a relatively closed board, but if he does bingo on row 14 I should get good counterplay at least.

#note yikes, I didn't even notice that he played UDO twice in one game until now

>JD: AEENRST M2 EASTERN +76 401
#note EASTERN blocks bingos much more effectively than ATTENDERS or SERENATA.
>Emmanuel_Umujose: BO 8M .OB +15 266
>JD: FLNNQTU 3F QU.NT. +22 423
#note Q likes keeping NQU for spread, fishing for a big Q play on row 14 by playing FENT# this turn. makes sense.
