>JD: AAEFTXZ 8G ZAX +38 38
#note an extremely tricky opening rack! I had never played this kind of rack before in CSW, so I wasn't sure at all what to play. Quackle's two suggestions that beat ZAX are FAX at 8H and FAZE at 8F. FAX prevents him from overlapping the X with an A or E (setting up ZAX/ZEX) and also directly threatens a 50-point Z play. FAZE threatens AX/AX/ZA for 50 directly, and potentially some FAX re-underlaps for more points. But ZAX is only a point or two worse, and Peter may play differently from the computer anyway.

>JD: ABEEEFT 10F FAE +42 80
#note FAZE would probably have given me a 60-point X play after AIOLI in response. but this is a pretty good sequence too.

>JD: CEIOTTY 10J YETI +34 242
#note no spot for TOYETIC! I liked YETI because it sets up CO- plays at 12L, but it also creates a Q hotspot, so mixed bag.
>Peter_Kougi: AGM 9K GAM +24 195
>JD: ACKORTY 8L CAKY +63 305
#note I chickened out on YACK - there was no need to chance it here.
>Peter_Kougi: ?EEIJLR -?EEI +0 195
>JD: ?AJORTV B13 JOT +30 335
#note JOT is especially great here because I have the last A for column A - threatening a massive score!

>Peter_Kougi: DDIIV 5J DIVID. +22 250
#note his draw appears to have been execrable this game
>JD: DFLOOQS E1 Q.ODS +30 517
#note the remaining pool is incredibly ugly. quackle likes passing up the Q play and trying to draw QUERN through the U, but I think he's very likely to block so I prefer QUODS now.

#note best is to start with FERN at E11.

#note best is RAMIS to block his out of RIN.
