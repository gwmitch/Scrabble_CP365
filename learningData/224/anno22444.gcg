#note DRANT or DRAT both look pretty good, blocking a bigger scoring spot and saving CH- plays for next turn. I didn't play CHAT because I was worried about CHATE* maybe being good.

>Andrew_Fisher: FJOTUXY --  -42 85
#note did not expect this to come off!
>JD: ADELTTV I5 VELDT +23 164
#note given my knowledge of his rack, great chance to shut down the board. quackle still prefers TRAVEL on row 14, but I feel that this leads to a much more defensive setup.

#note missed a bunch of superior CSW words, TOEIER, LOERIE and TROELIE - know all of them, just didn't find them here for some reason.

>JD: AEIMNOW J10 WON +29 276
#note I didn't like the huge plays that ZOWIE set up on row 10, but WON also creates just as many big potential scores - with a J and one of the three esses he'll just play J..S/ZOS for almost 50, so I might as well just take the points for ZOWIE.

>Andrew_Fisher: NU M12 UN +13 276
>JD: ADGIMOS 14J GADIS +25 339
#note I didn't know AGAMOIDS# on this turn which would've put the game away. GADIS still puts me in good shape.
>Andrew_Fisher: AJU 8L .AJU +39 315
>JD: FGKMORS M3 SK.. +29 368
#note not a done deal at this point - the correct thing to do would be to recognize the danger of his next play and block in advance. but I didn't have enough time to recognize the upcoming threat. still, this wins every endgame.
>Andrew_Fisher: FIIOSTT 15J OTITIS +36 351
#note I had underscored myself by 10 after BEMIX, so I was sweating heavily to see if he would come up with OTITIS, which I saw becoming a win for him...if I foresee OTITIS I can make a play like GAK on the previous turn to block it.
>JD: EFGMOR B10 OM +19 387
#note in this case I actually thought I was salvaging a tie, but if the score was actually 351-358 as I thought at the time I should play OF here to guarantee the win! didn't have time to realize my error when playing it. thank goodness for me that it didn't end up mattering.
>Andrew_Fisher: F G14 .F +10 361
#note at this point andrew pointed out that I had underscored myself by 10, and what I thought was a defeat snatched from the jaws of victory was actually a win.
>Andrew_Fisher:  (EFGR) +16 377
#note didn't play my finest in that last game, but a good morning of day 3 altogether!
