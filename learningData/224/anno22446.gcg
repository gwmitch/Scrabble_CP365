>Lewis: EINRRSU H4 RUINERS +66 66
#note annotated game at table 1 of the 2015 World Scrabble Championship.
>Jesse: AADSTVY 10F VA.TY +27 27
>Lewis: BCHIOTX G3 BOX +26 92
>Jesse: ADFGOST 9G D.AFT +28 55
#note definitely better than FOG because I'm already down a bingo and need to open.
>Lewis: ?CHIILT L3 LITCHIs +83 175
>Lewis: AACDDMS (challenge) +5 180
#note lewis missed CHLORITIC 2x2 for 102! I think he said after the game that he saw it, but chickened out.
>Jesse: DGNOOOS M1 GOOD +19 74
#note I'm already down a lot, so I wanted to fork open the board a bit by creating two good bingo lanes.
>Lewis: AACDDMS F2 DAM +19 199
>Jesse: EKNNNOS 8L .KON +24 98
#note even with 10 Es left, I felt that I needed to keep my E to heighten my chances of bingoing next turn. but quackle says NNS and ENNS bingo about the same, so I suppose I shoukd've taken the points.
>Lewis: AACDSTU 1M .AD +15 214
>Jesse: EFILNNS 2A FINNE. +20 118
#note I really need to open the board, and I could find no other play that did so effectively.
>Lewis: AACSTUW 6L .AW +16 230
>Jesse: EHIILQS 1B QI +24 142
#note I saw FIQH, but I wanted to keep the possibility of bingoing down from the F because I need some kind of big score at this point. my odds of drawing FLESHIER are actually quite good - 
>Lewis: ACIOSTU 7B CAUTIO.S +63 293
#note wow, he missed FACTIOUS for a huge score here!
>Jesse: AEHIILS K4 HI +21 163
#note my win chances are pretty awful, but at least I can't play AHI at 8A because I'm blocking all the bingo lanes I would need to hit to have a chance.
>Lewis: EGIORUW 2M .WE +25 318
>Jesse: AEILSTV C7 .ESTIVAL +74 237
>Lewis: EGINORU 14C .OUNGIER +63 381
>Jesse: EGJLRYZ H13 J.Z +57 294
>Lewis: AEEEEPS 13G A.EE +22 403
>Jesse: AEEGLRY 12A GY.E +26 320
#note doesn't hurt to try setting up the 3x3 in case something happens - but an even better way is LEVY at 12A, since the L is easier to hit.
>Lewis: EEEPPRS A12 .EEP +21 424
>Lewis: ELPRRSU (challenge) +5 429
>Jesse: ABELMOR 15J RAMBLE +42 362
#note I really shouldn't give up quite yet - might as well play BIMA or BIRO and go for the bingo. but all he has to do to block is to play anything long on row 12, which he will almost certainly do. still, can't hurt to try!
>Lewis: ELPRRSU 5D PLE..S +37 466
>Jesse: ?NOOT O10 TOONi. +6 368
#note was out of time - SERR/SNOOT is the play.
