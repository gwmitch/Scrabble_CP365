#note VACANT at M3 might let me bingo a little bit faster, although with all the Os left I thought I might get to play FOVEA at D1 next turn to really open things up.

#note sacrificing a ton of points to make this play - means that if I do bingo, I have a good chance of chasing him down.

#note quackle likes keeping the Z with the hope of playing it for a huge score on row 15, at a spot that could be tough to block if he doesn't have one of the few remaining Es. I figured that ZORI at least opened a potential lane to bingo through, but Q's suggestion of WEROS# is probably the play.

#note certainly worth a challenge, past tense of TODDE#
>JD: INPSSSW N1 PWNS +26 290
#note I thought this gave me a chance if I can pull the blank and bingo to the C.

#note brutal - I had just drawn I(D)OLISE(R)S for 86 points to potentially steal the game!! at least I have a good fish, but assuming he's more likely to block rows 2 and 3, the only winning bingos to the C I can draw here are GNEISSIC or ASEISMIC#, with just 2/45 probability. better than nothing!

#note top play is ILEA at this same spot to set up ESS at I1 to go out. HIs play actually just blocked a potentially game-winning SIAMEZES#, but I didn't know the word anyway.

#note gave this one a good try! just not quite enough lucky breaks.
