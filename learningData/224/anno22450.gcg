#note ugh - just have no excuse for the miserable level of phonying this tournament! in this case I've even studied FAVICON, so how could this word be good?

#note I was thinking of FAVICON as I played my dumb phony, but then neglected it here. definitely the best move.

#note I saw SWIVETS but thought it was best to pass up the bingo and cover this hotspot, which worked out very poorly for me and was probably a mistake anyway. Passing up bingos is more often correct in CSW than TWL, but usually it's in the case that the bingo scores weakly and future blank bingos are likely to score a lot more given the current board. ISTV? bingos 70% of the time next turn, but the bingos are not really worth more than SWIVETS is right now. the only non-bingo play that sims competitively is VOTES at 10B which scores 43 and takes out one of the main scoring spots on the board.

#note goes without saying that this doesn't play if I choose SWIVETS last turn.

#note Q suggests VIM, but I thought it blocked up the board too much - andrew must know I'm close to bingoing and will likely block. but it is substantially more points, so I probably need to take them and hope he can't block effectively.

#note it doesn't seem impossible for me to win, but I clearly need to draw a bingo. furthermore, there's only one lane on the board at the moment (a good one on row 13) so I have to make a play that creates a new lane. Analyzing now, Quackle suggests a bunch of reasonable alternatives: AGIN, HANG, ING and GIN on column C, or ACHED/GATED at H1. The fishier plays make Andrew's next play much tougher, and make it such that I don't have to draw a bingo playable at both top and bottom. However, a fish for 8 points opens the possibility that Andrew can ouscore me to win, often simply by playing on column H. on further analysis, I cannot find a single play that works with best play on Andrew's part, because he can usually outrun anything - I was eying ANTHEMIC/HEMATIN as a possible draw, but I don't win if he blocks ANTHEMIC. At the end of the day the best try I can come up with is HIDE at F2 setting up my C - I can draw some bingos that might be difficult for him to block.
