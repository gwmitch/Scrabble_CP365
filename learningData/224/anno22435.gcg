#note I had some momentum from the previous game and was feeling good about my playing again. But I didn't know either KOTWAL# or MATLOW# which are better plays here.

#note ouch! another big power tile blank bingo against.

#note seemed right to bingo on this turn to open things up, if I eschew the bingo now it actually might be tough for me to get a bingo down next turn.

#note an opportunity, if he doesn't have an N or the last S this bingo spot could cause him a headache

#note DORTED# is far away the best play, but had I seen it I wouldn't have been confident enough to play it. about a 9 point error.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: ABTY 8K B.ATY +30 352
>JD: DDESTUW 4A DUDE +18 336
#note DORTED is still there and still best. I felt that I was conceding without making some type of opening, but Q suggests this is a major error - W(E)D/WE gives me a 25% chance of bingoing, and it will be unblockable if I draw it since there are Ts in different corners of the board. If I don't know DORTED, then I agree that this is my best chance rather than blowing up a good rack to open with DUDE.

>JD: EGHSTTW B2 TE.GH +40 376
#note all of a sudden I actually have a chance thanks to a lucky sequence. I was predictably low on time and played TEUGH very fast, since it even sets up the S on column A for next turn. THUG is worth a glance since it holds a vowel in a very consonant-heavy bag, but I can't pass up the 15 extra points here.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: EFLPRVX 14I R.FLEX +34 410
#note the key play of the game, I think he said that he had PV left on his rack. he probably must take the points and hope that he draws the A for an AX overlap or maybe the C for a play on column A.
>JD: ILNRSTW A6 SWIRL +29 405
#note best sequence, unfortunately for me he has drawn big plays on both left and bottom-right so I can't win. drawing the A instead of the I would've led to a fairly straightforward win for me, for instance.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: ACIPPV 13M PAV +33 443
>JD: NT 14B T..N +12 417
#note a tight game - I did about as well as I could given my lack of CSW knowledge, except for DUDE which was probably wrong but worked out pretty well for me.
