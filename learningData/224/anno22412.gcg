>Joshua_Sokol: GMOORTT H4 GROTTO +18 18
#note I was first going to play GROOM keeping TT when I saw this. I like M's and I hate duplicates and G's, so I prefer this play. But MOTTO wins a simulation, since GR has synergy and I'm scoring 2 more.
>Deen_Hergott: AIJ G8 AJI +37 37
#note and not giving this back I guess
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CFMRSZ 10F F.SC +25 43
>Deen_Hergott: AEINRVW 4A WAVERIN. +88 125
>Joshua_Sokol: ?KMNPRZ B2 PR.NK +42 85
>Deen_Hergott: AADEGHR D3 H.ADGEAR +64 189
#note Great find by Deen. I don't know if I would have seen this.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAGMNZ C8 AMAZiNG +103 188
>Deen_Hergott: MNO B8 NOM +30 219
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEILTY E2 EE.Y +29 217
#note So many letters can hook this, but I need to be aggressive at this stage. I don't like the looks of LEE(R)Y over EERY
>Deen_Hergott: EILOU 1E LOUIE +23 242
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILPTV 12A VE.L +20 237
#note I hated making this play. Nothing seems to work well at all here. I should play F6 VIE though, as it blocks a decent amount of scoring and leaves more stuff open for me.
>Deen_Hergott: EIW A12 .IEW +30 272
#note yeah :(
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIPT F3 P.ED +25 262
#note VIE it was.
>Deen_Hergott: ACNY F10 .ANCY +21 293
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIILT 13F .ILIATED +76 338
#note wow am I lucky
>Deen_Hergott: BEU H12 B.UE +27 320
>Joshua_Sokol: HIOQRTX 14J XI +52 390
>Deen_Hergott: DELOSTU 2I TOUSLED +72 392
#note J5 LOUDEST scores the most and gives back the least, it would seem, but either way things aren't looking that bright for Deen.
>Joshua_Sokol: EHOQRST K1 Q.OTH +34 424
#note I was all ready to play Q(AT) for 12 after my amazing ES draw. HOSTER bingos with every single letter in the alphabet except FGKQTVWYZ, which is every tile in the pool except FT. Doesn't mean they all play, but that's impressive.
>Deen_Hergott: INOOSTU O1 O. +9 401
#note It looks really tough for Deen, but it seems he has to empty the bag and play M11 OU(D). That opens another bingo lane and will make it extremely tough for me to block him if he draws into more than one bingo. Unfortunately for Deen the tiles remaining in the bag were not going to allow him to win anyway.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEFRRS 6J BaRFS +34 458
#note I must block (T)UITIONS here. This seems like the best way of doing it, but I'm unsure. Maybe just BaRF. Perhaps SERF/QUOTHS---what?! QUOTHS* is not a word! Wow, just got reminded of that. Jeez... 

EDIT: I blew it here. Unbelievable that I missed the possibility of Deen having S(AT)IATION 8F! Wowsers! That would have been quite the finale. I must play REFS or REBS/(FISC)S to prevent both TUITIONS and SATIATION.
>Deen_Hergott: IINOSTU L8 UNITI.S +26 427
#note He had TUITIONS. Gross. He should have had SATIATION. That would have been just what I deserved.
>Joshua_Sokol: AER 3M ARE +16 474
>Joshua_Sokol:  (O) +2 476
#note Final score 476-417 due to Deen's overtime.
