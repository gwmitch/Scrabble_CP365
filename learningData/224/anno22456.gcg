#note there are plenty of plays that don't suck here. VITE looks good, not giving back a whole lot of points, or TRIVET to open the board more. I got confused with VIVO.

>JD: EIRRTTV J6 VI.T +15 15
#note I was pretty demoralized by this point, to be honest. I think in retrospect that I like VERT at 9D to open things up, since I'm already down a little but with a reasonable leave.

#note really unnecessarily fishy - might as well just play the relatively normal play of KRAAL

#note DOUANIER makes it much easier for me to bingo again. definite mistake. although really I'm not going to win this game at this point.

#note I was fishing for ESCAPEE/ESCAPES on row 13. it won't be enough unless Neil does something ridiculous, but who knows. GET at 14M makes it less likely I draw the play, but also blocks cheap scores on column M and scores a few extra points - maybe that way I can eke out a win.

#note a really dreadful game to end the tournament, crippled fundamentally by my early phony (not for the first time this tournament, either). if I ever needed encouragement to really master the CSW15 lexicon, this game should provide it.
