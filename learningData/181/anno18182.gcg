>Mack_: AELRSST 8F ARTLESS +66 66
#note Wasn't sure which bingo to play and where, and didn't want to waste much time. Quackle likes this word at 8D.
>Joey: AEGNNOR I4 NONG.ARE +62 62
>Mack_: IIITTVZ H1 ZITI +45 111

>Joey: CDELOO 10B COOLED +24 99
>Mack_: ADFINRY C9 F.RAY +30 213
#note I considered FORAY, 6F FINNY, and 12K DIARY. Given the score, I rejected DIARY, and I figured FORAY was superior defensively as, while FINNY only blocks the N (it also blocks one S but not the other so that factor is immaterial), FORAY obstructs the Os and the C. FORAY edges out the other two options in a short sim.
>Joey: AEHY D12 YEAH +43 142
>Mack_: DEILNOV 15D .OVEL +33 246
#note I figured IND was more than 3 points better than LON as a leave, hence HOVEL over HIVED. Quackle likes HOVEL better statically but HIVED better by 0.6% on a sim.
>Joey: AEM B12 MAE +24 166
>Mack_: ADEIINN 4D ANI +17 263
#note This play and 12J INIA, which I also considered, sim equally at the top.
>Joey: ?DEEOUX L1 tUXEDOE. +80 246
>Mack_: CDEIJKN J1 DJIN +31 294
#note I also considered JUKED, but didn't want to slot the D in the triple lane. Quackle likes M2 NIDE and 3A JINK, neither of which I would play.
>Joey: HIT M2 HIT +37 283
>Mack_: ACEKMOU L11 .AMEK +32 326
#note I thought this was better than SMOCK in order to keep a more balanced leave, but Quackle likes SMOCK by about 3% in a short sim.
>Joey: BEOU M9 BU.EO +30 313
>Mack_: CFORSUU 14J FR.SCO +46 372
#note Despite the UU leave, 46 points is 46 points and I think I have to take this. As long as Joey can't hit column O immediately, I can block it and probably outrun any bingo through the N on row 6.
>Joey: GW O13 W.G +21 334
>Mack_: AIINRUU C1 NAIRU +14 386
#note This play essentially forces Joey to make the blank an S and bingo at 6A, which is extremely difficult. Also, I will be able to outrun such a bingo in some cases, and this leaves one in the bag, thus preventing Joey from fishing without telegraphing his entire rack.
