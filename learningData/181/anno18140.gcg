#note Also considered ZEE, ZA, and ZEATIN, but this seemed like it would give me much better chances of bingoing, so I took it.

#note Thought about PAGES here, but I much prefer playing this and keeping a leave with great bingo and scoring potential to playing PAGES and keeping a leave that has neither, while still offering up a big scoring spot. FAG D12 is an option but opening an S hook and closing a scoring spot that I can use well seems like a poor idea.

>Noah: ABEEPSW B8 WEB +33 283
#note This is risky, but PESEWA just gives back very good cheap points and keeps a much worse leave, so I don't think it's better. There are definitely other plays worth considering though here, and I didn't really consider them. The best other plays seem to be 1H BAWbEE, 12G BEWRAP 2H BEWRAPS, and D12 WEB. The first three all block stuff and keep worse leaves then WEB, while not scoring enough to make up the difference, so I prefer WEB. 7 points do seem very real here, so I think I'm okay with my WEB as well. I'm not sure about this turn.

>Noah: AAEPSUU 12H PA.EU +20 303
#note Or UNAU -- I sure didn't like keeping the school Nigel used to go to on my rack. However, I felt like it was still a servicable leave and keeping pace with Nigel was important, so taking the 20 seemed good.

>Noah: AADEOSU 15G ODEA +29 332
#note Blah, very bad. I thought for a moment that I should look for something else because this makes my winning chances dreadful -- ADO(Z)E is the high-variance play I was looking for here.

>Noah: ACCEKSU 2J C.ACK +38 370
#note Wow, had no idea CRUCK was good. :( That seems like a surely better play. Is there anything better still? It seemed like I had to keep pace with Nigel to have any chance at all, which RUCK 11C didn't do. Maybe CRUCK can win me a game with a play through the X if he gets sloppy. It also surely maximizes spread.

#note I was hoping I could draw something from EX, as I didn't really see another way to win. This doesn't hit anything though. I can't find anything that hits anything.
