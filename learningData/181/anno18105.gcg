>Josh: ADGOOPR H4 PAGOD +24 24
#note At this point I'd just lost 3 in a row and I was flaming with anger. I need to learn to control that. I was 95% sure PARGO was good but I decided that PAGOD/PARGO is close enough
>Emanuel: IILNORT 4H .INITOL +18 18
#note actual rack
>Josh: FGORSTY 6F FO.GY +29 53
#note I saw FROSTY last turn but after 3 minutes waiting for Emanuel to make a move I forgot about it. It's 50 points. and G(O)OFY is 32 at M3. I played way to quickly. I thought this was at least better than FOGY I7 cause of the S hook FOGY blocked. FROSTY seems right but GOOFY seems strong too.
>Emanuel: EEORRST O2 RESTORE +85 103
#note Emanuel thought PRESTORE was invalid
>Josh: DINORST N4 .IDO +20 73
#note I don't know what got into me here. Actually, scratch that, I do. I was frustrated as hell.
>Emanuel: MNU 3K MUN +20 123
>Josh: LNRRSTW G5 L.W +21 94
#note I2 WR(I)N(G) seems like an improvement. I saw WING and missed WRING in the same spot.
>Emanuel: ADEGINR M7 GRADINE +80 203
#note Not only did I challenge this, I also didn't think he had any other options available, which convinced me to challenge. After it came back as valid, I took a line on my scoresheet to write "GAME OVER". I don't really need to review top 1000, do I?
>Josh: ENRRSTV -  +0 94
>Emanuel: AFQR 11J FAQ.R +34 237
>Josh: ENRRSTV 14J VERST +42 136
>Emanuel: EIWY 12K WI.EY +59 296
>Josh: AELNORS 8C SOLAN.ER +67 203
#note Keeps the board more open for a comeback
>Emanuel: ABKLU -  +0 296
#note Right back atcha, Emanuel challenges SOLANDER.
>Josh: ABCEEEH 5J ACE +33 236
#note I want to keep the board open so I decide against C2 BEECHES or BEACHES. The leave here is bad but I feel like I need to focus on keeping the board as open as possible while scoring to mount a comeback. This does that all the while creating a stronger 7 lane than before with E(MIC)
>Emanuel: ABKLU C3 BAULK. +34 330
>Josh: BEEEHOZ D3 EH +24 260
#note But I was at a loss here because I missed HEEZE. Since P(RESTORE) was still available I felt like playing EH here just made getting the P even stronger, which I deemed a good idea. (P(EH)). But yeah, HEEZE for 45. 
>Emanuel: HIMPTU E3 TIP +21 351
#note First lays down HUMP at D2 and murmurs "that's horrible, I'll let you bingo up there" and then puts this down. Little did he know how horrible his play was, in fact, as 57 points just went down the drain.
>Josh: BEENOUZ 2G BONZE +44 304
#note Are prospects starting to brighten up?
>Emanuel: DEHMOTU 10E MOUTHED +81 432
#note He had HUM in his leave and he drew into a bingo.
He had HUM in his leave and he drew into a bingo.
He had HUM in his leave and he drew into a bingo.
(This was what was clouding my thought process for around 4 minutes)
>Josh: ??CENUV 6A CE. +7 311
#note Shooting in the dark now. I wanted to draw an A so I could at least bingo on row 1 with something like ELUVIAN* or EXUVIAN*, as he's obviously going to block the 3x3
>Emanuel: AAEIISX H10 .AXIES +63 495
#note Oh wow, sure, make a play that loses sometimes, see if I care. Don't play AE(C)IA A4 like someone who actually respects their opponent...
>Josh: ??AINUV A1 UNIVo.Al +185 496
#note See if I care, really. Ask me what I think about (T)AXIES.
>Josh:  (AIJT) +22 518
