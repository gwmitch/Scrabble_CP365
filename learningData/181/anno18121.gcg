#note Looked for a while, and came up with EA(V)E, (L)UMA, and (L)AME. LAME seemed better than LUMA because three Es didn't seem very good. Keeping a more balanced leave on a board where it seems decent for bingoing and scoring was a good idea, I thought. Surprisingly to me EEER and EERU are about even according to superleaves! In that case I like LUMA more than LAME, because it gives fewer hooks away. As for EAVE vs. LUMA, I'm unsure how to decide between the two. Sim likes LUMA by a couple points, for what's it's worth.

#note Thought about HI also, but dropping the Z for a lot seemed fine here, especially with all the cheap points HI gave away. I won't deny how strong the Z is on this board though, and how lame HIIR is.
>Dave_Wiegand: OW B10 WO +28 152
>Noah: BEHIIOR 14B O.IBI +18 174
#note Mainly considered BIO and ORBIER alongside this. ORBIER keeps a much worse leave while not really doing enough better w.r.t. scoring spots, while BIO leaves open that juicy column A spot.

>Noah: EEEHIRR 9C .EER.. +13 187
#note Tough play. I considered HE(AL) and RE(AL) alongside this, and missed H(I)REE, another option. I can't detect a reason not to play H(I)REE here, as it scores way more, doesn't open up as juicy an E spot, and seems to still keep a fine leave.
>Dave_Wiegand: AE 15A AE +8 195
>Noah: EHIINRR D4 INHER. +20 207
#note Seems a little better than ERRHINE/REHIRE/HIREE thanks to scoring spots and leave and score. H(a)IR is also available, but I don't think that leave is worth sacrificing several points for here, especially when the pool seems pretty solid. 
>Dave_Wiegand: ?ADENSX 7G h.NDAXES +66 261
#note Pretty serious mistake by Dave. SpANDEX is a lot of points.

#note WANT is the other option, and seems a bit better than this if I happen to draw the Q. However I don't think it's *that* much better, and ABN seems to score a fair bit better if I don't draw it.
