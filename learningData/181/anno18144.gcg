>Josh: ?FGKLTU F6 FU.K +19 19
#note damn, I can't remember my rack. I think this was it. 
>Emanuel: ACINOSV H3 AVION.CS +67 93
#note I held this briefly
>Josh: ?CEGLNT D4 LETC.iNG +76 95
#note this was held, in turn.
>Emanuel: MOT E3 TOM +20 113
>Josh: AADIISY 10D .AY +37 132
>Emanuel: ITZ F2 ZIT +37 150
>Josh: ADEEIIS 4H .IA +6 138
#note I noticed 10H (S)EI after my play. That looks a bit better as it sets up a tile I actually have. It seems close between (V)IE and (V)IA only because ADEIS is a better leave than DEEIS. Otherwise VIE takes way too many hooks to be VIABLE ;)

I5 DIE was something I didn't manage to spot. It also looks decent since it scores.

>Josh: AEEOQST 6B QA. +32 218
>Emanuel: BI 1N BI +16 223
#note He didn't know what to do here. He obviously thought BEEDI took an S, which it doesn't. 
>Josh: EEORSST 12D STEREOS +94 312
>Josh: EEORSST --  -94 218
#note And so did I! I was a tad worried that it didn't though, cause I knew something was weird about the word. Anyways we don't think he would have challenged STEREOS/BEEDIS. I really don't know why I did this by the way
>Emanuel: JU 11B JU. +11 234
#note bad play given my rack
>Josh: EEORSST E8 .R.S +38 256
>Josh: EEORSST --  -38 218
#note but it's OK, phony 4s to the rescue!
>Emanuel: R 9D .R. +9 243
>Josh: EEORSST B11 .OES +22 240
>Emanuel: ADIM A12 MAID +41 284
#note this is deserved
>Josh: AELOSTT N1 ..T +5 245
#note looks as good as anything
>Emanuel: FO O3 OF +11 295
>Josh: AELORST 3H .L. +7 252
#note Even worse, I miss OLESTRA! This game is a train wreck
>Emanuel: ?AEILRR M5 EARLIeR +63 358
>Josh: ADEORST 11K DO. +8 260
#note glug
>Emanuel: EEINPRT 12F INEPTER +77 435
>Emanuel: EEINPRT --  -77 358
#note First he laid INEPTER# at N9, forming II*, which he almost didn't notice. This would have given me a decision to make as to if I should challenge or not, since it game me 149 points and a few comeback lanes. 149-82=67, whereas challenging gave me +82. I guess the board is the same with or without a challenge, so challenging is right
>Josh: AENPRST N9 TREPANS +82 342
>Emanuel: EEINPRT 15H PTERIN. +30 388
#note This looks better than RIP(E)ST as it doesn't give back another lane. 
>Josh: ADGHORS N5 AH +32 374
#note I doubt anything ever wins here, so I decided to cut spread? J10 HAG apparently wins 1/12 of the time. Maybe I should just try and win with L10 H(O)G
>Emanuel: EEVW 12I VEEW +33 421
#note Oops, I messed up. I think the I in EARLIER was the blank, not the E. Too lazy to go back. He played VIEW. 
>Josh: DGLOORS O6 SOD +18 392
#note -2. I was in time trouble
