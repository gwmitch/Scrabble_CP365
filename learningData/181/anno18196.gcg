>Chris: DEEESTT 8H ET +4 4
#note Even though you're not supposed to make 4-point opening plays, I make one here. Marilyn wasn't happy that I scored 4 points for some reason, and said 'Oh no, he's already close to a bingo' or something like that hehe. TEED E8 is simming best, but I'm unconvinced; I really don't know what's best here.
>Marilyn: AYY 7F YAY +15 15
#note This placement is weird since H7 scores 3 more and this doesn't seem to have strategic merit otherwise. I guess it does facilitate a more open board...
>Chris: DDEENST F4 EDD. +13 17
#note I have both front hooks for this, so if i draw a bingo to my NEST leave on this board I should be able to play it somewhere after EDDY vs something like DYED, i think
>Marilyn: ACRX 4C CAR.X +28 43
>Chris: EENSTUW 5D WE. +23 40
#note This and NEW F3 are tied at the top of the sim. This makes it harder for her to score whilst i'm fishing, so I like it.
>Marilyn: EGLMNTU -EGLMUN +0 43
#note Exch. 6
>Chris: DENOSTU 9G SNOUTED +71 111
#note Didnt see C4 CONTUSED, which, although it gives up big spots as well, is better for long term board shaping than SNOUTED. The sim likes it by about 3.3%.
>Marilyn: AELM 8L MEAL +37 80
#note Marilyn makes a meal of the juicy spot I provided
>Chris: ?EFFIKT 7K TEFF +35 146
#note I thought this TEFF gave back less than the other one, which also scores 35. KEF for 30 is simming best, but thought 5 points + blocking the O column was worth keeping KI? > FTIi? here. 
>Marilyn: INQU K3 QUIN. +28 108
#note Scoring and attempting to set up an S hook on this increasingly closed board. Its pretty easily blockable by playing either parallel to QUINT or on the 3 row above CAREX though. 
>Chris: ?GIIKPR L1 GRIP +37 183
#note KIP L2 is suicide after the strong S(QUINT) inference, but GIP L2 for 6 less looks much safer and will lead to a win by crunching the board pretty often here I think. This sims best, but I think it's a careless play.
>Marilyn: COO C2 CO.O +24 132
#note Forking the board. Now with the floating G, C, B line, and O line, this board is opening. I could have been much more aggressive in closing it had I played GIP last turn.
>Chris: ?EIJKLV 1L .IVE +24 207
#note This doesn't sim too badly, and I rectify my mistake with GRIP albeit a tempo too late. I miss the best play in my 3x paranoia though, K(O)JI for 31 at B3.
>Marilyn: ?DEINOS O8 .ESIONED +80 212
#note There goes my advantage...
>Chris: ?AJKLSV 2A JA.K +34 241
>Marilyn: ALUW B5 WAUL +21 233
>Chris: ?ALRSTV 3F TAV +27 268
#note I was tilted that she blocked TRAVELS/VARLETS but at least I didn't let it stop me from making the best play this time lol
>Marilyn: AEHZ C7 HAZE +41 274
>Chris: ?AEILRS 11B ALInERS +79 347
#note This is actually tied at the top with hAILERS for 85 at A7! I wanted to block HAZE hooks and row 1 bingoes at once, although this give up the juicy B10 spot. Interesting play!
>Marilyn: BINR B10 B.IRN +36 310
#note Grabbing the spot that I left as expected
>Chris: AELORT D8 RAT.O +32 379
#note Don't have the 7th tile here (it's an E, don't want to change everything). I was concerned about the H going at A12, but figured that a play there would block the BAIRNS hook and then I could block the right and win the game. However, this opens the RATIOS hook, and a big H play plus a bingo there would almost certainly win the game for Marilyn. I think saccing equity with TOEA A12 is the right idea here instead of what I did.
>Marilyn: HORU A12 HOUR +46 356
#note Step 1 complete. Immediate punishment hehe
>Chris: BEGIIL N12 GIBE +30 409
#note Gotta do this and hope she doesn't have a bingo at 13C (7th tile is an E again)
>Marilyn: GIMNOPT M13 POM +35 391
>Chris: EILNOS M3 SON +35 444
#note The second E in LESIONED was actually a blank, hence my rack confusion late in this game. POM blocked me from copying her and playing LESION(ED) myself at H15, which would have been funny.
>Marilyn: GINT H11 .TING +21 412
#note Final score recorded as 437-417.
>Marilyn:  (?EIL) +6 418
