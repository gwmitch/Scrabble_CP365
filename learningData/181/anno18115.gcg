>Josh: AEGHNTV H8 GANEV +26 26
#note It was close here between GANEV and HAVEN, but VEGAN seems decent too. I like this best though
>Emanuel: AZ G9 ZA +44 44
#note Still like it...
>Josh: HILRTWX F10 WHIRL +35 61
#note ZA wasn't played immediately so I imagine he was probably considering ZOA as well. But I have a feeling he's strong anyway from the way he was acting. In that case I think I should play WHIRL over XI for 47 because it takes out the easy S lane. Perhaps WHIR should be a consideration too though, even though it takes an L and an R. I'm confused though, this gives him another S lane, so that's silly logic. I though go for the points in that case.
>Emanuel: DIORRST 15F STRIDOR +89 133
>Josh: NOOSTTX I8 OX +47 108
>Emanuel: FGI 7I FIG +28 161
>Josh: ENOOSTT L5 TESTOON +66 174
>Emanuel: EEGIKNP K1 KEEPIN. +34 195
#note This is his full rack. A lot of options are interesting. EKE for 32 at E11, PEEING M9 (which he laid down first) and PEEKING/KEEPING. I like PEEING over everything else. No pun intended.
>Josh: ?EIIIOU -IIOU +0 174
#note I saw the preponderance of consonants here and decided to keep two vowels. I stand by it, even though keeping E, I or just the blank look very good too
>Emanuel: AAAAAAA -AAAAAAA +0 195
#note I wrote down exchange 7 but I don't think that's what he played.
>Josh: ?AEIJLN 1K .ANJI +51 225
>Emanuel: AABELRS 3D ERASABL. +64 259
#note E4 ARABLES
>Josh: ?AEILRU E1 RU.ALIzE +64 289
#note I held ERASABLE and released. 
I looked forever for something that scored, but the only things that play here are RU(R)ALI?E plays, either the S, the T or the Z. Maybe I should forego the bingo here and play JEU or JURA? I don't think so.
>Emanuel: AGVY 1D G.AVY +42 301
>Josh: EFOSTUU 2N OF +33 322
#note J2 F(L)U was overlooked. That's the play. I considered FOETUS D8 or M10 and OF 2N, as well as 8L (T)OFU. I don't think this was the right play. 
>Emanuel: CDEILNN 6A INCL.NED +65 366
#note but it blocked a better spot for this. 
>Josh: EMSTUUW 12L SWUM +40 362
>Emanuel: DHOR 8A HORD. +33 399
>Josh: AEEIOTU O12 .OUE +18 380
#note I don't think this was my rack. Maybe it was. I'm in trouble. But MEOU was better and I didn't see that until too late. MEOU is better cause it's more easily overlappable. 
>Emanuel: APT 11C PAT. +18 417
#note I don't like this play. Emanuel was losing time.
>Josh: ?EEIMQT 8L .ET +3 383
#note Now what? I felt like nothing looked too good and that this play was the best way to win; i.e induce the most errors.
>Emanuel: BDEITUY O4 DUBIETY +107 524
>Emanuel: BDEITUY --  -107 417
#note yes!
>Josh: ?CEIMOQ 14I QI +29 412
#note I had time but I didn't want to give him any. Nothing wins. I was hoping I would draw another big hit at A12
>Emanuel: BDEITUY 12B BEY +30 447
#note A few plays win, 12A DUIT and 4D T(A)BID being the best of the lot. This does not. He didn't have any time left.
>Josh: ?ACEEMO 13C AE +20 432
#note -4 to 13B ACE + 2B OlE(U)M
>Emanuel: DITU 9N ID +5 452
#note  -5 to 14A DIT
>Josh: ?CEMO A11 COMEs +37 469
