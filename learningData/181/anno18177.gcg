#note This sims slightly ahead of LORE/ROLE in the same spot.
>Bnjy: EQUY K2 QUEY +49 99
>Mack_: EIIILNS 11I SILENI +30 81
#note I overlooked NISEI, which looks safer and a bit better than SILENI. Exchanging two Is is also simming well, but I don't think it is worth forgoing a 30 point play.
>Bnjy: AW J6 WA. +26 125
>Mack_: AEEGIMP 10L PIMA +30 111
#note I waffled between this and N5 IMP for a while, and then ultimately settled on this to unload the extra vowel and eliminate the N10 hotspot. After 1000 iterations, IMP looks better by just under 1%.

#note This isn't great, but there isn't much else here. This sims 1.5% ahead of the next contender, 9G ROUE.

#note Awww if only there was an open DOZEN for PRIVAT(DOZEN)T :).

11E VAT/TAV was the other option I considered, but ultimately settled on this to open a few more lanes ad turn over more tiles for the blank. The 11E plays apparently sim 2% better, though.
>Bnjy: ACDHR D6 CHARD +18 295
>Mack_: ENNOPRV 8A VEN. +21 258
#note Didn't consider NOVA for some reason, but I like this better anyway since the E is easier to bingo through than the O. Quackle wants me to play 3B ENVIRON, probably due to turnover, but after Bnjy closes the B column I will lose as no bingo lanes will remain. I think I still like this play.
>Bnjy: DJN 3C DJ.N +24 319
>Mack_: EHINOPR H13 .HO +18 276
#note This looks good, as it opens up a new lane while keeping the G column open for words with an N in the third spot and ending in ER. Quackle likes G3 NORI, but that has to be wrong since I have no bingo spots.
>Bnjy: CFOS B10 CO.FS +38 357
>Mack_: ?DEINPR F6 ........D +16 292
#note I clearly have to forgo PRIsONEd here, as Bnjy will easily win being up â‰ˆ20 points and a tempo in the endgame. After DEGREASED, I will draw G1 PANNIER with either an A or an N, but neither of those tiles yield a bingo from 15H to 15O. I would need to draw a bingo both at G1 and 15H to win, so with optimal play by Bnjy DEGREASED never wins. There is a reasonable chance, however, that he overlooks the G column lane, so if I pick up an A or N I can win if he misses that lane. I missed a better play, however: DEGREASER. If I pick up an A or E, I draw OEDIPEAN and PANDIED/PINWEED and will narrowly outrun Bnjy unless he has G3 ENTOIL. As it turns out I couldn't win, but DEGREASER is undeniably better.

#note Nothing plays at G1, so I must settle for this.
