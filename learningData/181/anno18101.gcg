>Josh: EEGOOUY 5H .OGUE +12 98
#note 10E EU(L)OGY looks OK but it opens more stuff. J4 GUYO(T) is nice too. 2E GOO(N)EY looks good as well. I think I should have played GOO(N)EY, but I wasn't sure of its validity so it didn't come to mind.
>Emanuel: AADEIMN 2B AMANDI.E +80 144
>Josh: BELOORY 1A OBEY +56 154
>Emanuel: FK 7G K.F +28 172
>Josh: DLNOQRU M2 QUOD +36 190
#note I'm not sure if this is better than L1 ROQU(E). It does give a lot of points back...
>Emanuel: ?AEGNST 9B NeGATES +70 242
>Josh: AHILNRW N1 WIN +36 226
#note In hindsight, 4L H(O)WL, the other option I thought of, might have been the right thing to play given my deficit. My leave bingos a lot more...
>Emanuel: EEIMPST 11D EMPTIES. +74 316
>Josh: ADEHLLR 12J H.LAR +27 253
#note 12J H(Y)DRA looks good. I first considered 12A HALL, then I wanted to see if HYLAR* was valid or not. I thought it was and that it was likely Emanuel would challenge. Pretty silly.
>Emanuel: ADINSW N8 INWA.DS +38 354
#note but it gave him this so he let it go
>Josh: DELNOOR 14G NOODLER. +63 316
#note I actually thought this one was valid. He held again and let it go.
>Emanuel: GJ H13 J.G +33 387
>Josh: LOOPRRU D4 PROLO.U.R +102 418
#note I was all set to play PRORO(G)U(E) and then I saw PROLO(G)U(E), and then this, and I just went for it hoping it was valid. It's not, but Emanuel couldn't push himself to challenge because he thought he was going to win without.
>Emanuel: ?CEIOSV B8 u.VOICES +90 477
#note But this doesn't always win, he has to realize. PROLOGUER was plausible enough, I guess. If I hit ZIBET at O8 I will usually win.
>Josh: ABEHIIT 7D .I +2 420
#note but no ZIBET/comeback for me... :( This was a really really endgame that had me thinking on very many levels. I felt like I needed to block AZ(O)IC to have a chance of winning even though if Emanuel plays perfectly I have no chance. Since I'm going for the win much more than for spread here, I felt the need to try to induce as many errors as possible. So I played this to block AZOIC, to keep HABIT in my arsenal at O4 for 48, and to keep the possibility of (ZA)I(R)E if Emanuel decided to play ZA/ZA at M11. Obviously it's the "wrong" play but I had to try to get him to mess up.
>Emanuel: AACIZ 9N .A +2 479
#note -27 to perfect play by me, but again, that isn't what I'm trying to do here. I didn't expect this though, and it's a winner, most likely. 
>Josh: ABEHIT A14 HA +26 446
#note I wanted to keep (ZA)I(R)E as a possibility and block some possibilities of outs in two for Emanuel. I should have tried to block CZA(R) maybe.
>Emanuel: ACIZ 5A CZA. +15 494
#note Emanuel misses CA(P)IZ.
>Josh: BEIT O6 BET. +24 470
#note -2 to (D)EBIT F2
>Emanuel: I M12 .I. +12 506
>Emanuel:  (I) +2 508
