#note In analysis, we agreed on a play on the left side over KLUGE, because you're sacrificing just a little bit to block. However, KNURL F10 or GULL G11 look better for leave, though KNOLL has the benefit of me potentially not knowing KNOLLY, which is why Conrad played it over KNURL.

>Conrad: AAGGHRU L2 RAH +26 337
#note AGHA G10 is pretty cool here. Conrad hadn't seen MATTING. UNHANG seems like a better way of doing what RAH does.
>Noah: ?EIINRU I2 URINE +15 297
#note Didn't love this play, but opening up seemed appropriate, and there weren't really any good fishes, as fishing is very weak in a position like this for hitting bingos, since Conrad might block, and I also need to score to make sure a bingo will win.

#note Hoping I draw OVERLIVE AND Conrad somehow scores very little next turn, which could possibly be a good strategy against a much worse opponent, but the chances of this working against Conrad are tremendously slim, and spread is very important in this tournament position, so I think just doing VIV(E) would've been better.
>Conrad: BEEFGIR 3E GIBE. +11 417
#note Best play is FIBR(E), setting up G(L)E(B)E with EGE(R) for backup.
