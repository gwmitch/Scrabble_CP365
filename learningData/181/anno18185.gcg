>Mack_: ABEFNOS 8G FOB +16 16
>Jason: IO 7F OI +9 9
>Mack_: AEEGINS 7I AE +8 24
#note Chose this placement over 9I in order to eschew a potential X bomb. BE is another option I considered, but I generally like to avoid one tile fishes.
>Jason: ABIRV 6J BRAVI +28 37
>Mack_: ?AEGINS 9G SEArING +76 100
#note While bingos such as lEAVINGS score two more points, I like this better since I want a closed board after going up a bingo.
>Jason: HKOO 5I HOOK +37 74
>Mack_: EORUVWY 6B VROUW +40 140
#note Very fortunate to have this play to bail myself out of an otherwise ugly rack.

>Jason: AY C8 AY. +22 247
>Mack_: EEEIMRT B8 ME.E +27 295
#note Also thought about IMAGE to avoid giving back MEZES and column A, but felt that a 45 point lead wasn't large enough to become so focused on defense. Quackle agrees, with MEZE simming 3% better than IMAGE.
>Jason: IO 8A I...O +24 271
>Mack_: EEEINRT A11 RETIE +20 315
#note I am not too worried about opening the board, since if I don't take the A column now Jason will go there sooner or later. Quackle concurs and this sims best.
>Jason: MU C3 MU +18 289
>Mack_: EEEINNR 1F RE.INENE +59 374
#note Or INTERNEE.
>Jason: AEHNRST 14A .NEARTHS +76 365
>Mack_: ADLLNPR N2 PA.L.D +31 405
#note The only other reasonably good option is QINDAR, which I missed, but this gives Jason less to work with so looks better.
>Jason: ?AFGLST H12 FA.T +33 398
#note This was Jason's actual rack. If I have the X, Jason has no winning play since I will have good plays like C12 PLEX and 2J AX. After FAST, I will still be able to win if Jason picks up the X in numerous ways, the best of which appears to be QINTAR. Jason's other good options, B1 FLAG and D12 FLAG, also lose after I block H12 XyST. There is one way Jason can win though: if he fishes off the F, say with C13 FE, I cannot stop him from bingoing if he draws the I. He is threatening 13G AIGLeTS, and PAST, PHT, and PST all give back PIGTAiLS among other things. Plays such as APT/AS give back sevens hooking ASS, so I will lose in that scenario.
