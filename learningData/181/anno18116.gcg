#player2 Josh Josh
>Emanuel: AEHMRX 8D HAREM +28 28
#note He drew an X upright and he saw that I had seen it, so he said he wanted to mess with my mind and set it up.
>Josh: GGNRRRV G7 V.G +13 13
#note I had to block I think, but R(E)V might be a superior play. Maybe it isn't worth my effort to block 40 points though, when it's cutting my next score by a lot more than 10 points. Interesting.
>Emanuel: AX F8 .AX +29 57
>Josh: GGHNRRR E6 GR.N +9 22
#note Now that the board is like this why not cut his score down to the bare minimum? It's really all I can do, hopefully I can make up the points I'm sacrificing later.
>Emanuel: ILOO F3 OLIO +11 68
>Josh: ?AGHRRT G2 GHAT +25 47
#note I wish I had an F to punish him for that
>Emanuel: EISTZ 4F ..ZIEST +52 120
>Josh: ?AERRSU I8 SURREAl +69 116
#note Damn, I didn't see (S)qUARERS or (S)UgARERS. I need to imagine my blanks as Qs when I have a U. Other options could be better than this as well. 
>Emanuel: BEIV D3 VIBE +22 142
>Josh: ACEILPW H12 PLEW +46 162
>Emanuel: Q I3 Q. +21 163
>Josh: ACEILMN J12 ACME +34 196
#note Now the question is; how strong is he really after Q(I)? There aren't very many lanes to work with, but should I really give him a 7 lane with ACME? I think it's kind of necessary given the score, this scores more than any other option and doesn't make it really difficult to bounce back if Emanuel bingos.
>Emanuel: OOT L1 TOO. +5 168
>Josh: EEFILNR 1I FER.ILE +30 226
#note I think this is right
>Emanuel: AW 5B WA. +8 176
>Josh: IJNNRTY B5 .INRTY +22 248
>Josh: IJNNRTY --  -22 226
#note Major screwup here as I first lay down JINNY* and realize it's phony after laying down (W)INTRY, then I play this instead.
>Emanuel: COO N1 .OCO +12 188
#note now that he knows my full rack I could be in trouble.
>Josh: IJNNRTY B5 .INTRY +22 248
#note I decide to go with this anyway
>Emanuel: ABEK K10 BAKE +36 224
>Josh: EFJNNSU O4 FUN +19 267
#note I think I should block instead of score with FENS L9
>Emanuel: DDE O4 ...DED +33 257
>Josh: ?DEJNPS L8 JEaNS +65 332
#note Just PEDS? I think it's right to burn the blank to score so much, but perhaps I should keep my blank to counteract his S.
>Emanuel: N M1 .N +5 262
>Josh: ADENPTU N7 ADEPT +23 355
#note blocking the lanes
>Emanuel: DIILOTU 3B LU. +12 274
#note I blocked TOLUIDIN! That word brings back bad memories...
>Josh: IINOSUY 9L .Y.. +12 367
#note Messed up my tracking here and thought he had a B and an A, which was impossible. He was out of time though so there's that. 5J NISI seems like the right play
>Emanuel: ADIIOT M7 DA. +28 302
>Josh: IINOSU A7 OI +14 381
#note -1 to NISI
>Emanuel: IIOT 5J TI +10 312
>Josh: INSU 12E UNS..... +14 395
>Emanuel: IO -  +0 312
#note time trouble challenge
>Josh: I 11N .I +2 397
>Josh:  (IO) +4 401
