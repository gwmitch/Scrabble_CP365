>Will: AHTW 8F THAW +20 20
>Mack_: BELLRTV H4 VERB.L +15 15
#note The only other decent options appear to be LAV, which gives back too many hooks, and exchanging, which definitely doesn't seem worth the 15 point sacrifice.
>Will: JLO 5E JOL. +22 42
>Mack_: DDELMTU 4H .ELDT +18 33
#note Although no options here are particularly appealing, this is still a suboptimal play. F4 MOULTED and 6H RUDD are definitely superior, and this wins about 4% less often.
>Will: ?ACHINR K2 HA.RoNIC +76 118
#note Though clearly inferior, CHROmATIN and ANCHORITe definitely get some style points.
>Mack_: ADEMTUU J6 MU +21 54
>Will: AEGP 2J P.AGE +34 152
>Mack_: ADETUUY 6F YA. +29 83
#note As much as I hated making this play, it and 1M AYE, which I also considered but dismissed, are the only plays that score reasonably well. 29 points is simply too much to forgo by exchanging or dumping for few points with a play like F8 TUTUED.
>Will: OY 1N YO +20 172
>Mack_: DEITUUU -DEIUUU +0 83
#note With VERBALS being the best bingo lines, turning over more tiles for the esses is at a large premium. I wanted to keep a consonant due to all the vowels left in the pool, but wanted to also maximize turnover. Keeping the T alone seemed like the best compromise.
>Will: DEEFIRZ H2 DE...... +14 186
#note Will's actual rack -- this is a great setup play for FRIEZE.
>Mack_: BIQRSST 10F QIS +47 130
#note Though it closes my best lane, I really have no other choice but to do QIS.
>Will: EFIRZ 3C FRIEZ. +56 242
>Mack_: ABILRST 11D BRIT +25 155
#note I liked this play, since it scores reasonably while setting up a difficult to block lane hooking ITS.
>Will: DW L1 D.W. +15 257
>Mack_: AGLMNOS 8K .MAGO +33 188
>Will: ?GNNOPS 12G SPONGiN +77 334
#note This play was incorrectly scored as 75.
>Mack_: ILNOOSV 12A VINO +30 218
>Will: DEI A12 .IDE +24 358
>Mack_: AEEILOS 4A ALEE +19 237
#note At this point, opening a triple triple lane is my only shot at a miracle comeback. Quackle prefers 2A ALOE, but ALEE is definitely harder for Will to block effectively while scoring well at the same time.
>Will: UX 13I XU +36 394
>Mack_: EIINOST 14G INOSITE +74 311
>Will: IORRU A1 OUR.RI +18 412
>Mack_: AEFKNOT B10 KO.NE +46 357
#note Whoops... not sure how I missed KNIFE. It didn't cost me much though, since I have several good places for the F.
>Will: ACEESTU 15D CAUSE +38 450
>Mack_: AAFT B6 FAT +27 384
>Will: ET A8 ET +12 462
#note Final score recorded as 462-384.
