#note Thought about this for a bit less than a minute, but it didn't seem like there could be anything better than PUTZ. Didn't think of WATAP, but it doesn't score nearly as much and gives back a lot of cheap points. I'm happy with this.

#note I looked for a while for a play here, but all I saw was WANE and AWN. On entering this, I noticed ANEW G10. The other option is, of course, exchanging. I thought about EN, AEN, E, and nothing as keeps. Ditching everything didn't seem worth it because a few lines were open, the N seemed decent, and AEN and EN were hard to decide between. Looking at the position now, it looks to be between AWN and ANEW. ANEW usually gives back a lot of points and leaves be with a combination that is even worse than usual here, but sometimes he plays somewhere else and I get paid handsomely. Since I could keep EN instead, I thought trading was worth it. AWN is similar, except it keeps the E and gives back a less dangerous scoring spot (though AWNS is a better bingo spot, while AWNY isn't too dangerous because only one Y is left). I liked keeping the board tight and going for a bingo enough while forcing Kolton to act first, so exchanging seemed good. Thoughts?

>Noah: ?AENOOP 10F .OO +12 47
#note (L)OAN is another option. I feel like keeping the better leave and going for a quick bingo is strong here, but I'm not really sure. Thoughts?
>TEAM: BDI K5 BID +27 108
>Noah: ?AEFNNP L1 PENNA +24 71
#note Thought about PENNA (wasn't 100% on PANNE) and FANE somewhere. PENNA gave me a more open board with a decent sized deficit and scored more, while the placements of FANE make the board either harder to bingo on or easier for Kolton to score on without opening me much. So I chose PENNA. 
>TEAM: DJOW 2I JOW.D +18 126
>Noah: ?FIMRSS 11G FIRMS +27 98
#note It didn't seem like much else was good -- this looked better than FIRM and MICS seemed like it would work out pretty poorly in too many cases -- FIM is awkward here if I don't draw a bingo, and I still bingo about as much as MYCS after FIRMS, according to a sim.

>Noah: ACELRVY 1L .ACY +36 242
#note I missed (I)VY, which is viable here for sure. I also didn't think of (P)ERV, which I like better for keeping a more flexible leave (V seems really bad here to me) and slotting a tile at O1 that is easier to bingo from. 6 points is definitely something, so I could be wrong, but I think that is made up for in the long run thanks to the leave. Between IVY and PERV, I think I like PERV, to score more and keep the more immediately good leave. With no bingo lanes that are great for it and so many Es out, ACELR is close to its worst on this board.
>TEAM: EEW 2E EWE +31 288
>Noah: DEGLRUV M5 GUV +17 259
#note This seems like a big mistake. GUR(G)LED is a strong play that I saw but quickly dismissed due to the ugly-looking V leave. Outside of leaving the V, though, GURGLED does a lot well. It opens a pretty threatening scoring spot that balances out the one on row 1, and if both are taken, which is likely, this leaves two areas of the board with decent bingo lanes on them. GURGLED also scores much better than anything else, and goes deep for the blank, which is absolutely key here. Nothing else seems better -- G(U)V F12 is okay but doesn't score that well while not really threatening much immediately.
>TEAM: AEILNR 1A LARINE +30 318
>Noah: ?DDELRU 9C D.L. +9 268
#note Wow, OILIER is a really good play here that I immediately dismissed because of DDU?! Gotta score and open a lane here. Bingo percent is okay after OILIER, and almost 50% combined over the next two turns according to a sim (that figure is probably more like 30-40 thanks to blocks, granted). There's a common theme between GUV and OILIER -- I need to see past immediate leave a bit better, I think. Sometimes other considerations are just more important.

#note This was Kolton's actual rack. I was pretty surprised by this play, as Kolton loses if he draws the Q. I think he can win every game if he passes, and maybe can win with some plays as well. INIA seems to win everything, though it's much, much worse than this for average spread, which is fairly useful in a one-day like this.

#note I feel like I played this endgame correctly, but it's pretty hard to say. I'm too lazy to go through it all and Quackle certainly isn't getting it.
