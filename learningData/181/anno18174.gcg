>Seth: HJNO 8G JOHN +28 28
>Mack_: ACIINST I7 C.IANTIS +68 68
#note I had a feeling there might be a seven in this rack, but there isn't, and this is the only available bingo.
>Seth: ENQU 10F QUE.N +36 64
>Mack_: AGIRTUU 11D TUI +17 85
#note Thought about phoneying with AUGURIST*, but figured Seth would challenge it off. This looks fine, and sims neck and neck with AUGUST, which I also considered but deemed too dangerous.
>Seth: AEOPRRT 14B PRAETOR. +74 138
>Mack_: AAEGRUU 12I .EGUA +12 97
#note Not good. AUTEUR and GATEAU are clearly better here, and, in retrospect, I am surprised this is only simming 2% back.
>Seth: EGNV M9 VEG.N +26 164
>Mack_: AAAEERU D6 AUREA.E +16 113
>Seth: OVX E4 VOX +35 199
>Mack_: ADEFIOW C3 WAIF +33 146
#note I also considered 15E FADE, but the IOW leave seemed too ugly especially with this much of a deficit to overcome. Also, if Seth leaves it open, I have a good shot at hitting row 15 next turn after WAIF.
>Seth: OZ 10B ZO. +32 231
>Mack_: DEEIOOR 15D ERODE +37 183
>Seth: LM 5B M.L. +14 245
>Mack_: BIMOOSW K4 WOMBS +39 222
#note I was reluctant to get rid of my S, but there are really no other good options here. This sims best my a large margin.
>Seth: EIIIII -EIIIII +0 245
>Mack_: BEIIORT L3 TORII +30 252
#note This looks best, as it scores, dumps vowels, and goes for the blanks while giving few counterplays.
>Seth: DEGL M4 GELD +31 276
>Mack_: ?ABDESY 8A DEA.Y +27 279
#note I'm not really sure why dropping the Y at 9C is crushing the sim. This play scores more and plays off more tiles for the other blank and S, and with no bingo spots the superior leave doesn't seem too important here. I feel like I would make this play again if I encountered the same position.
>Seth: HY 10L H.Y +17 293
>Mack_: ?ABESST 14K BEST +22 301
#note I liked this play a lot as it sets up my case S, but apparently 13F BAIT, which I overlooked, wins a whopping 16% more often. I suppose that, on this tight a board, plays like O12 FIsT may win too often for Seth. Seth can also score well at N6 though, especially if he has the K, so creating this counter-hotspot to balance that one seems favorable.
>Seth: DIN N6 DIN +26 319
>Mack_: ?AFLPRS O7 SAP +29 330
#note I wanted to avoid emptying the bag if possible, and was scared of plays like O1 CLOAKs. The other option I considered, O12 RASP, apparently wins 65% of games to SAP's 38%. I suppose the BESTS hotspot is easier for Seth to use since it only requires a 4 tile play as opposed to a 6 tile play at O1. In hindsight, RASP looks a little better, but Quackle's suggested disparity still seems quite high.
>Seth: ?ACT O12 CAsT +30 349
>Mack_: ?FKLLOR 3B O.L +6 336
#note At this point I am in severe time pressure with probably about 90 seconds left. My first thought was the intuitive 15J KiF/KeF, but that puts be up 6, and after Seth plays B10 ZIN I can't block his out of 4E VIE. With only a few seconds left on my clock I see OW and OWL as setups that will be impossible for Seth to block effectively. After OWL, Seth's best sequence of GIBE then ZIN would result in a 1 point win for me without the overtime penalty. OW is better as plays like FoLK score more than KiF, but taking the time penalty into account OW still loses by 1. 4A KOA also wins without the penalty but loses with the penalty, and there doesn't appear to be a win taking the penalty into consideration. I suppose I just needed to see one of my wins quicker. 
>Seth: EIIN K12 .I.E +7 356
>Mack_: ?FKLR A1 KiF +37 373
>Seth: IN B10 .IN +12 368
#note Final score 372-363 in favor of Seth after time penalty. Props to him on a well played game and well earned win.
>Seth:  (LR) +4 372
