#note Ottawa Matchplay, game 1 in best-of-5
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEFJSV F8 .AJ +26 26
#note The leave is clunky enough that it may be worth burning the S with FAVES. The TWS setup may be less worrisome after an inference of all 1-pointers on his leave. Though TAJ defends against the bingo slightly better. I think this is fine.

#note My logic turning down NOVAE was dumb. It opens a scoring spot, but it closes an equally strong spot. GONEF is fine too and NOST is not 18 points better than those 4-conso leaves. Quite a weak play.
>Phil_Waldron: BEEP 5J BEEP +21 108
#note The first of what will be many bingo blocks by Phil!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IMNOSTT 4L MOTT +26 101
#note Should have given more thought to 6M OM and 4L MOT, both of which set up my letters if I draw some scoring tiles to make them worth while.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AILLNNS 9E L. +2 142
#note Looks like my best shot? Lots of sevens. Lots of eights to the G. And SOLANINES/DISANNUL as surprise attacks on the other side of the board.

#note Let's try setting up my A again.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIINRSS C9 NARIS +31 186
#note Will need more than a bingo at this point. It felt like I had to take the points here. Fishier options sim close. Need to hope he can't kill me on the AX spot.
>Phil_Waldron: GIM B10 MIG +38 317
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIKQRSW -KQW +0 186
#note Not technically a bingo block, but he did just kill WIRES for 62.

#note Wish I'd spotted the best legit plays! Fishing off the W gives me a decent shot at PICCOLOS or COLONICS. Realistically, Phil will probably kill the S asap at this score, so I felt the need to open a spot. This certainly gives me the best chance of anything, though there was always the risk of a challenge.

#note This was the play that convinced me Phil was psychic.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CHILNOP N6 H.. +14 343
#note Used the rest of my time trying to find a shot at a nine from SO. Going for CIPOLIN in two places. He could block both if he knows it.
