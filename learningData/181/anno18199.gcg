#note With only one S left, N10 SAJOU may be better. The board is fairly easy for Seth to open after JIB, so it is probably worth it to take the 19 points. Quackle claims that SAJOU wins 5% more frequently.

#note SUK is another option I didn't consider here. With all the junk remaining in the pool, it may be slightly better since it reduces my shot at drawing the unwanted tiles.

#note This scores so much more than anything else that it has to be correct. Quackle confirms this and ranks it 8% ahead of the next option.
