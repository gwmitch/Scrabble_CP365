#note Didn't see OLIO in the same spot, but I think I like this better since I don't have an S.

>Mack_: ADDENSX 14L DEX +47 265
#note I saw 15D SADDEN, but wanted to block column O. Also, if Joe does not block it, I will often be able to play in that spot next turn.
>Joe: ?HILOPS N3 LItHOPS +76 254
>Mack_: ADDNNOS O6 ODA +32 297
#note Despite the four consonant leave, this seemed better than DONNA to score more and block column O.
>Joe: EEEP 15F EPEE +28 282
>Mack_: ADNNSUY O1 YUAN +29 326
#note I also considered O12 ABYS, but chose this to block the O1 hotspot and keep a superior leave.
>Joe: AOZ M1 ZOA +30 312
>Mack_: AACDNOS 9C AD +18 344
#note I don't have enough of a lead to make a blocking play like 5J COAST, and I wanted to create a second bingo line so that I could get a counterbingo if Joe bingoed with VATS or to the T in LItHOPS. This sims neck and neck with 11B CAID, which I also briefly debated.
>Joe: EQRUY B6 QUERY +49 361
>Mack_: ACGHNOS 1H SCHNO. +63 407
#note I don't really understand why A8 AG is simming better. I figured Joe had the blank at this point, so it is definitely conceivable that AG will lose even if Joe doesn't bingo. SCHNOZ, however, forces Joe to bingo, which is not particularly easy on this board.
>Joe: IIOORTT I13 .I. +4 365
#note Actual rack. Joe mentioned that he was hoping for the blank for TORTONI/RIDOTTO at 2B, but after I block with something like I2 CAW he can't bingo. J1 HO and K2 NO, however, win if he draws the blank since I can't block InTROIT at both C1 and 3D/3E.
