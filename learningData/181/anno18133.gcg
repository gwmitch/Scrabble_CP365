>Josh: AAADDEN H7 AA +4 4
#note I should have just gone with DADA. I thought this leave was better than it is
>Emanuel: EMOP I7 ME +16 16
#note POME put down first, then this, after a few minutes
>Josh: ADDEHNT G5 DAH +23 27
#note this looks right
>Emanuel: ADEIOPR 5C PARO.IED +74 90
>Josh: DELNORT H1 TOND. +24 51
#note This rack gave me a headache, but this seems like the right thing to do, since I need an open board for a comeback
>Emanuel: BEMSTUX 2E BUX.MEST +73 163
#note oy
>Josh: DELRSUW 9I WUD +23 74
>Emanuel: IO 8K OI +6 169
>Josh: EEILORS 1K OILER +23 97
#note I guess I could also just fish for 15 at J5. I like this better though
>Emanuel: EIOPSTT 10C POTTIES +70 239
#note :/
>Josh: ?EEJLNS C2 JEE. +26 123
#note I guess I should more or less guarantee a bingo next turn with D3 JE(A)N? But I mean I need to bingo to win anyway so better to just take 4 more points... Or not, who knows? I almost played 6B JEE, for I am really desperate at this point.

#note Confused with SANTOLINA?
>Emanuel: IQ N6 QI +64 383
>Josh: ?ILNNST M8 LINNeTS +67 190
#note MANNITOLS is the 2x2.
>Emanuel: AVV 14J VAV. +18 401

#note can't remember my rack
>Emanuel: EFKOORR A4 .OO +4 405
>Josh: AABELRS E8 RA.ABLES +70 266
#note Gotta leave more bingo lanes open, 12F ERASABL(e) is wrong. Held and released
>Emanuel: HIRR 14B HIR.R +20 425
>Josh: ?EFKNNU D4 K.F +38 304
#note Drawing the Z is at a premium. I need to play this because it doesn't use a lot of tiles. The best scenario I can hope for is playing this, drawing into C(O)Z F4 and bingoing the turn after, or something along those lines. Or maybe B6 FUNK is correct to bingo next turn and hit the Z in two spots, the other being D4
>Emanuel: AWY B6 YAW +30 455
>Josh: ?EGNNRU 12E .URGEoNN. +74 378
>Josh: ?EGNNRU --  -74 304
#note I looked very hard for a bingo cause it was still possible to win if I bingoed + drew into something that scored enough to win, most likely C(O)Z, hopefully Emanuel wouldn't see that with the time he had left. But I couldn't see anything except the outside shot that this is a word. He could afford to challenge because of the last two tiles in the bag unable to score enough to win
>Emanuel: CCEIOYZ A8 OYEZ +63 518
#note Emanuel had some really nice options this turn! From C(O)Z to OYEZ to E(P)IZO(I)C C9!
>Josh: ?EGNNRU H10 .UGENe +24 328
>Josh: ?EGNNRU --  -24 304
#note I've now, in my Scrabble career, phonied with EUGENOID*, EUGENID* and EUGENE*. That should do.
>Emanuel: CCFIU 12C CU.IC +22 540
>Josh: ?EGNNRU 15A GeNE. +27 331
#note This is the right play because Emanuel missed his best play next turn
