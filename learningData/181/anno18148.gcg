>Josh: AADEPRU -AU +0 0
#note Championship game. I'm now 9-8, I need to win this game, but Emanuel needs to win more than I do. I considered PAREU and PURDA as well. I just wasn't completely certain if PURDAH was good, if PURDAS was good or if PAREUS was good. They all are, but I wasn't 100%. I think that justifies this play cause otherwise the three options are extremely close. Reason being ADEPR is a great leave; I bingo more than half of the time next turn.
>Emanuel: FOU 8G FOU +12 12
>Josh: ADEEPRV J8 REPAVED +80 80
#note J5 DEPRAVE scored the same. I considered it but it seemed to keep the board with too many comeback options compared to REPAVED
>Emanuel: AEFO 12H FO.EA +30 42
>Josh: AEGNQSZ H12 .AZE +48 128
#note I considered Q(U)A, GAZES/FOVEAE and then (F)AZE here. I didn't want to play Q(U)A cause I wanted to keep the board relatively controlled. M9 GAZES seemed to do that best, but I also liked keeping my S for FOVEAS/FOURS, so I decided to play (F)AZE. Keeping the Q was a huge downside though. In hindsight I think I should have played GAZES. It just reduces his options so well
>Emanuel: BDEX I11 B.XED +61 103
#note wow, wasn't expecting that!
>Josh: GILNOQS K11 G.L +31 159
#note I played this too quickly. I should have added the S for 16 more. 
>Emanuel: CR I7 C.R +12 115
>Josh: IINOQSU M7 QUOINS +38 197
#note K3 QUOINS scores the same but leaves him with so many more options.
>Emanuel: ?INORRT -R +0 115
#note actual rack. 8L R(U)IN looks right
>Josh: AHIINNS 8L N. +3 200
#note I had to infer a really strong rack. This blocks the most bingos and I might draw into TAHINIS or an 8 if he bingos at A7/A9. I almost played HIN at N6 but that's just crazy after his last play.
>Emanuel: ?IINORT N2 INtROIT +80 195
#note 15A was a threat from the start though. Here he had INTROfI(ED) and ROuTINI(ZED), which would have put him right back in it.
>Josh: ADHIINS O8 SIDH +36 236
#note Damn, SANDHI, I'm not sure I knew that one but I obviously didn't see it.
>Emanuel: EGOUV 5I VOGUE. +20 215
>Josh: AEEIILN O3 AI +7 243
#note I almost played ALIENIZED... haha silly French. I think 3I ANILI(N)E will have to do here. No use trying to reduce his score if I'm not going to be able to keep a good lead. This was a bad play.
>Emanuel: AD 14F DA... +20 235
>Josh: EEEILNN 15D NEE +7 250
#note This seems better than the 10 point options because 15A is a prime scoring spot. All game I was in control and now I feel pretty helpless. It was due to my own mistakes, as I now realize. 
>Emanuel: TT J4 T.T +5 240
#note uh oh
>Josh: EIILNUY G5 UNI.Y +16 266
#note At least he didn't block my one decent play.
>Emanuel: E 6F E. +4 244
#note more uh oh
>Josh: AEGIILM E4 MIG +16 282
#note especially since he blocked EMAILI(N)G! I have to infer another really good rack now, so my best bet is to reduce his bingo % to a bare minimum with this play and hope for an OK draw.
>Emanuel: ABEINST 2M B. +4 248
#note so he had a TISANE leave both of these times. This seems right cause he can draw into a lot of stuff ending in A. 
>Josh: AEIJLOT D1 JOTA +46 328
#note A great draw. Although I missed JIAO, which would have been the better play in most situations, but luckily enough there are way more consonants than vowels in the pool, therefore my leave is actually better than ELT. This over JATO cause it reduces his score and bingo % a tad.
>Emanuel: AEINSTT C3 INSTATE +77 325
#note SATINET C2 for the same amount is better than this because it reduces my bingo % and score for next turn, although it does the same for Emanuel next turn, to a lesser degree.
>Josh: AEIKLMR B8 ARMLIKE +92 420
#note What a lucky break, wow. (J)AMLIKE as backup. I wasn't entirely sure of this either though, but it made too much sense. 
>Emanuel: ?LOORSW A2 WOOLeRS +89 414
#note  Hold! I held this until I could find a sure win. Just playing OW at A7 has a better winning % than this provided I don't find blocks Quackle can't find. To be fair there are multiple spots that Emanuel can draw into though.
>Josh: CEHLRWY D9 CHEWY +37 457
>Emanuel: AP A14 PA +16 430
#note -5 to milking me with 12A P(I)
>Emanuel:  (LR) +4 434
#note And there is the tournament! I repeat, this was ridiculously psychological. LWLLLWWWWWWLLLLWWW is ridiculous.
