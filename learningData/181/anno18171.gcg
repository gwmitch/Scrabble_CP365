>Mack_: AEEEIOO -AEEIOO +0 0
#note A great rack to start off the tourney. Not much else to consider here.
>Sal: ADEHY 8D HEADY +32 32
>Mack_: ??EGIIS E5 GaI.tIES +78 78
#note Looked for a while for bingoes to the Y and double-doubles that avoid giving up the X bomb, but this is the only one.
>Sal: FOX F4 FOX +56 88
>Mack_: DDIKRYZ D11 DIDY +25 103
#note Quackle likes DIRK in the same spot, but I'd prefer not to give back the S hook. This is a 1.7% error, apparently.
>Sal: EIVW D3 VIEW +36 124
>Mack_: AHKRTUZ 4F .UTHARK +36 139
>Sal: EE -EE +0 124
>Mack_: EEINORZ 10E .RONIZE +38 177
#note Missed OYEZ here -- this play sims about 2% worse. Not a huge error, but a mistake nonetheless as OYEZ is safer and keeps a better leave, while scoring only 2 less.
>Sal: EILMNRS L8 MERLINS +91 215
>Sal: EILMNRS --  -91 124
#note Although this gave me a spot for REIGNITE/RETIEING, I am nearly positive that IRONIZER* is phony and I can simultaneouly prevent Sal from bingoing next turn and clean up my rack with H7 EYING, so I elected to challenge it off.

>Mack_: DEIJORT 14B JO.ED +40 226
>Sal: CENOU 15F OUNCE +24 185
>Mack_: IMNNORT 14J MINOR +36 262
#note I also considered MON in the same spot to keep the board tighter, but this scores 15 more and plays off more tiles to get through the game faster, so I figured it was worth the risk of Sal bingoing down the O column. Also, I know that Sal didn't keep an S last turn, so that makes this play better as well.
>Sal: EPW 15M PEW +30 215
>Mack_: ABNRTTV M7 VAT +18 280
#note 13M TAV looks better. I think I was too paranoid about a bingo hooking FUTHARKS, but that is not likely given that the S must be in a specific spot.
>Sal: LL 8L ..LL +18 233
>Mack_: BBLNRTU J3 B.RBUT +16 296
#note Unfortunately, there isn't much I can do about the O column. I figured that I can outrun any bingo down the O column that doesn't reach the triple, and maybe even a few of those in some cases. Quackle wants me to play K1 BLURB, which definitely looks wrong to me.
>Sal: AA I3 A.A +14 247
>Mack_: AFILNNQ 9C QA. +26 322
#note Given that Sal can easily open more lanes by playing through the V in VIEW and that I have no great ways to block the O column, I decided to try to outscore a potential bingo with this play followed by 13M FIN rather than try to block the O column.
>Sal: AE 3C A.E +12 259
>Mack_: FILNNOT 13M FON +31 353
#note I could do something like B2 OF to kill row B, but I could be in trouble if Sal bingoes to the L. I figured that, should he bingo after FON, I'd still be up a few points and a tempo, which would easily be enough to win.
>Sal: ANP H1 PAN. +23 282
>Mack_: AILNOTU 15A ION +20 373
#note I definitely don't want to empty the bag and I'd also prefer to leave exactly one so that Sal cannot fish again without me knowing his full rack. This plays off the desired number of tiles and scores, so I figured it was best.
>Sal: G N12 G... +5 287
>Mack_: ACLRTTU B1 CURTAL +27 400
#note I saw POETLESS, but knew that this won and didn't want to risk losing after a low-scoring block in case I mistracked. Also, there is a reasonable chance Sal misses or chickens out of POETLESS, so I figured I'd go for this.
>Sal: EELOSST M1 TOES +26 313
#note As it turns out, Sal saw POETLESS but couldn't pull the trigger on it. K1 STEREOS is also a really cool fit here.
>Mack_: T 3A T.... +8 408
