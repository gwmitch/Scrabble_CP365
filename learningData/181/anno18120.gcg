#note This play is really tough, even though it's probably marginal. He just played OY, so I'd like to open a scoring spot, and ideally make it hard for him a bingo, though the latter goal doesn't seem achievable -- all the words are probably close on how many bingos they allow. I would also like a less open board since I'm starting with a lead and generally would like a closed board against Dan. Maybe GrANTEE I7? Accomplishes the same thing as GATEmEN in terms of scoring spots, but leaves no OY hook and puts the G at I7 to obstruct some of the board. Makes a fair amount of sense to me. Thoughts on this one? Hard with lots of close plays, and not worth spending *too* much time on in a game.

#note Big miss of FIX(T) here. I can't think of a reason not to play it -- can you?

#note Trying to close down the board more -- the parallel with PECTIN should reduce the number of lines available in the near future, if not immediately. So it was that I passed up other plays like BIZ, BLIPS, and BLIP, that were similar in score + leave.

#note Was worried about plays like FIREWALL and FREEWILL, which would win. However, I was unconvinced that any non-bingos won 100%, FIREWALL/FREEWILL are very rare, and he might not even see them. Let me know if you see a 100% win!
