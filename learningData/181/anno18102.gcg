>Josh: AEELOXY H8 OXY +26 26
#note Missing OXEYE. Bad.
>Emanuel: DMOO G8 MOOD +27 27
#note A ton of OXY extensions exist and this blocks them all
>Josh: AEEIILW 11B WAILE. +20 46
>Emanuel: DFU F10 F.UD +33 60
>Josh: ABEILNR C7 INAR.BLE +74 120
#note I chickened out on BIL(I)NEAR and missed BILAN(D)ER. Bad again although this still might be right.
>Emanuel: G 9C .G +3 63
>Josh: EGHJNRU 8A JU. +30 150
#note I felt I could no longer play J(E)HU because Emanuel was really close to a bingo. 
>Emanuel: ACENRST D1 CANTERS +76 139
#note I held this.
>Josh: AEGHNPR 1D .HANGER +39 189
#note I saw GRAPHENE# (really?) as a possibility with this rack. I was debating between playing CHANGE and hoping PRE(CHANGE) was a word or playing (C)HANGER, completely missing PAR(C)H or PER(C)H. PER(C)H looks right. I might perchance draw into a word in this very sentence!
>Emanuel: AIINOST 4B OS.INATI +59 198
#note I started boiling of frustration. Bad again.
>Josh: EOOPPUV B2 PO.VE +24 213
#note Because you know what happens when you don't focus on the move but rather on the game. You play really badly and miss a word that's spelled on your rack already for around 20 more equity. At 3I (you probably see it already)
>Emanuel: IQ 3I QI +42 240
#note results orienteering
>Josh: EEOPTUV I7 UPO +25 238
#note Closing the board, hoping to outplay/outdraw him
>Emanuel: EW 2F WE +28 268
>Josh: EEFLOTV B13 EFT +24 262
#note no FOVEOLET then
>Emanuel: ADD 2J ADD +12 280
>Josh: AEKLOVY 1L OKAY +40 302
#note First saw ALKY then OKAY/OAKY. Didn't stop and thing that maybe it's right to play ALKY despite EOV vs. ELV. 17 consonants vs 12 vowels. I didn't think that OKAY or OAKY had any real difference in valuation here. The sim disagrees and says OAKY is 2 points better. I guess cause of increased bingo %
>Emanuel: BHO A1 HOB +32 312
>Josh: EILMRRV 3L EVIL +18 320
#note I was scared of the Z so I didn't play (D)RIVEL 13F. I blatantly missed N1 (A)RRIVE. I played so horrifically this game because of frustration.
>Emanuel: ?AELNRT 5I sALTERN +73 385
>Josh: EIMRRST O3 .I.TER +21 341
#note at least this looks right, or maybe I should add the S.
>Emanuel: ?CEEGIS K4 E.EGIaCS +70 455
