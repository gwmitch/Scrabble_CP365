#note Tough one. I didn't like ZEDS (12A) - I usually try to avoid giving up an easy Z or J triple when there is a reasonable alternative. And opponent's last play suggests a bunch of 1-pointers, so I didn't rate to get burned too badly at 8L. But I missed ADZ (12B), which is surely a big improvement over AZURE.

#note Seems okay, but maybe it was a mistake to open a potential Q-spot at 4C. COOFS might give me better chances no matter who draws the Q.
