#note I think this play was weak, because most of the time opponent will be able to play one tile at M13, staying roughly even in score (or worse, if the W) without opening the board. EYRIE (13I) is much superior.

#note Obvious play, but the situation is pretty dire. In fact, only 1 tile in the bag (the blank) leads to a win with best play (2 of the other 7 possibilities produce ties). Luckily, the tiles were cooperating this time.
