#note Close between this and MEND I guess. I hate to open with a dinky play giving opponent good tiles to play through.

#note No excuse for missing this play. Obviously I can't stop the bingo so I shouldn't worry about the stupid triple line. Just blindness I guess.

#note The situation is starting to look bad, and the racks aren't cooperating. SIZY scores a few points, but doesn't do much for my winning chances. Not sure if there's anything significantly better.

#note Really bad move here. Maybe I wanted to leave the T open, but YIP or YIPE (J9) is a big improvement.

#note Really don't see much choice to this play, even though it rates to get hammered.
