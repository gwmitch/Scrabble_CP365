#note I think exchanging is preferable here over FOLD or FOND, but what to keep is not entirely clear. Quackle seems to like keeping ZOND or ZOD. Not sure I agree with this - it seems that any of these leaves would be significantly helped if an E is drawn, so why not trade 5 to maximize the chance of drawing one?

#note Another exchange. Keeping just the EZ seemed best here.

#note Bit of a misstep here - ZEE 8K looks pretty strong.

#note I liked this play better than FLAB - preserves bingo lanes, covers more dangerous hotspot, ANTI leave is not much worse than TINE.

#note A critical situation. I found the high scoring play and it seemed to put me in good shape, but poor draws soon sunk me. Was there a better move here? I didn't find the best simming play, and I seriously doubt any other human would have found it either.
