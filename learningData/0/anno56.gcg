#note This game had an unpleasant ending, and not just because my opponent bingoed out. As soon as I started to draw the last 4 tiles, FaTTiSH came down, and I said "Challenge", without noticeable pause, or so I thought. But my opponent, a stickler for the rules, had apparently been silently counting up to 5, and said it was too late to challenge. This ruling was upheld by the director, who was pretty much flabbergasted by first, the existence of the rule, and second, the insistence of someone to enforce it. Particularly since I had several minutes left on my clock. Of course it didn't really matter, since FATTISH is good, but it was not a fun situation. What a lame-ass rule!
