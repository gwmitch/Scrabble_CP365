#note Jerry's actual rack.

#note This play looks really cool on the board.

>Noah: CEORSUY O12 COSY +45 192
#note I could keep the S and make a fishier play, but I don't think it is right because Jerry can easily parallel and block FLOTAS, and he often will.
>Jerry: ALYZ 6H LAZY +47 178
>Noah: EGHRRTU G3 TRUG +24 216
#note I had a tough time on this play, mainly considering 11G SHRUG 18, though I didn't think of F13 GHI 31. I didn't like RUG or HUG because he is just going to take advantage of my opening most of the time. GHI probably keeps the openest board for bingos, while also playing good scoring defense. SHRUG keeps the most closed board for bingos, but also keeps ERT, which is undervalued on such a board. I think it's between TRUG and GHI. I instinctively like GHI because Jerry got to play the X later but truly I don't really know which is better. ERRTU isn't a wonderful leave at all.

>Noah: EEHINRT F2 HE +15 242
#note I also considered 12A HIRED 26. I know this is pretty much always going to get blocked, but it does delay blocking the other lanes at least. And yes, I know I'm not going to have a great chance even after a bingo, but I do at least need a bingo to win. HIRED will get blocked likely with a good scoring play, and keeps a worse leave to boot.

#note Is this correct? It seems fine just because nothing else really does any better.
>Jerry: ?KNO A12 .ONK +33 386
#note He had the blank at this point.
>Noah: AADFILR 10J FAR.I +20 366
#note This is a very bad play, and I knew exactly that as I made it, but just couldn't find anything else worth playing. C9 ARAMID is one option. The bad thing about ARAMID is that a four tile blocking play such as B6 WREN also blocks line 5, a more hidden bingo lane which is actually useful with my FL leave. Perhaps DRAMA or DAMAR is better. I can draw plays like BASINFUL or WEARIFUL after DRAMA or DAMAR, though I will draw another I about 70% of the time, which sucks. 
>Jerry: ?EINRRW 11G .INEW +31 417
#note Actual rack.
>Noah: AADILNS N2 LA. +10 376
#note If I draw R? I'm pretty sure I win. This is the best shot I could come up with.
