#note And this is where I lose it. I was thinking about how I could score an X play with a word starting with X last turn...I guess my brain didn't specify the I, so I played UD. CULEX, the correct play, would've been a huge swing as it blocked her bingo!

#note EX D11 is a much better play.

#note This is definitely the most interesting play so far. The main plays appear to be 6H FUEL 25, M11 AFOUL 25 and 4G FOLACIN 26. FUEL is the most passive option, not really doing much about the board, while FOLACIN and AFOUL make good openings that will soon be closed down. The top of the board isn't terribly easy to open in the first place, so I don't really like FOLACIN. I kind of like AFOUL because if she doesn't bingo pronto the bottom of the board can be mostly closed down for bingos. However, the DEXY hook will still be a major problem. I kind of like AFOUL because it does something pretty useful for the board, albeit carrying a bit of risk. FUEL is reasonable also.

>Noah: EEOTUUV 5D VOTE +19 385
#note Not a good leave, but I'm okay with blocking and keeping it. Of course, if I hadn't played FOLACIN, I wouldn't need to do this in the first place. I can't really do UVEA, at least after AH.
>Maddy_Kamen: LOP H1 POL. +18 316
>Noah: EKMNOUU J1 KUN. +10 395
#note Again, I feel like I should block the lanes. The other option is probably exchanging keeping EMN, but I don't mind this.

#note Maddy's actual rack.
>Noah: ?DEIOVY M12 DIVE +19 437
#note If she has GaNGRELS, GaNGSTER or GaGSTERS after this I'm dead, which is something I didn't really like about this play. I think most leaves in the pool are possible after MEG (ironically, CNRST wasn't one of them), except for a few leaves with the blank and some strong tiles. I either need to block or leave a tile in the bag and be in a strong position to bingo out if she bingos. If we put her on a mostly random rack, (it doesn't seem like she would keep 5 consonants or on the other hand a leave with which she had a bingo, so this evens things out enough, I think), then she has about a 1/24 chance of having a bingo with the G, and I think that's all she has. These odds may be more or less, but it's right enough that I'm okay with blocking and hoping she doesn't have the bingo to the alternatives Quackle suggest, like 13F IVY 13 and N8 IVY 19 (for the latter, there are many more bingos that fit at 14H than at O1).
