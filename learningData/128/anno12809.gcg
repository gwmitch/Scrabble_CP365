>Geoff: ?EIINRR 8F IRoNIER +64 64
#note This rack gains several bingoes in Collins, this included.
>Matt: DEGOSSU 7K DUG +12 12
#note Guh.  Trying to set up my S's while dumping GU.  SUGO# seems to do best, it's just frustrating to have to play an S off for only 15 or 17 points after he's bingoed.
>Geoff: DEFINU K5 UN..FIED +52 116
>Geoff: EOYZ (challenge) +5 121
#note Nice play!  Also UNDEFIDE#.  Glad that my TWL senses were correct on the validity of this at least.  
>Matt: AEEOSSS J8 .OS +14 26
#note Double guh.  I don't know what to do with racks like this.  OSE does look a lot better, and saves me heartache next turn.
>Geoff: EOYZ L12 OYEZ +58 179
>Matt: AEEILSS 15J LA.IES +45 71
#note I did see REALISES...but that burns all my ammo for only 60 plus it gives him a juicy spot to hit back.  At this score I need to hit big with both S's, either separately or together.  Quackle agrees, with this, AIZLES#, and ZEAS# all ahead of the bingo.
>Geoff: AGNORTU N8 OUTRANG. +72 251
#note Yeah this is not going well.
>Matt: AABDEQS O6 DAB +30 101
#note BAAED is 42.  Yeah that's the play.  At least I have a couple of Q possibilities next turn.  
>Geoff: EX O11 EX +36 287
#note LOL.  I almost knew he was going to draw into a huge play at O8, so I had to block.
>Matt: AENPQRS 5J Q.EP +15 116
#note I don't see how playing QIN# helps me.  It just makes it really easy for him to clog up the left side of the board.  Maybe exchanging NQ is right.
>Geoff: LOWY 4L YOWL +36 323
>Matt: ADNNRSS 3J RAND +28 144
#note Dump an S for 4 more I guess, but this game is over.
>Geoff: CGHIT H7 G.THIC +14 337
>Matt: IINNSST 10D NINT. +10 154
#note Opening up another lane.
>Geoff: ACEIOPT 14D ECTOPIA +69 406
>Matt: AEEIOSS 15G OE +20 174
#note Whatever.  I hate this game :).
>Geoff: EEFT 15A FEET +27 433
>Matt: AEHISST D4 SHEITA.S +74 248
#note STASHIE#.  Good to know.
>Geoff: ?AEKLMO 2D LEuKOMA +68 501
#note Only.  Geoff is a super-awesome guy, and I was glad to chat with him about Clockwork Angels, I just wish our first game wasn't so ridiculously one-sided.
>Matt: AILMRUW 1H WALI +43 291
#note Hey I got this right at least!
>Geoff: ABJORVV O1 JAR. +33 534
>Matt: MRU 13B RUM +15 306
#note Not the way I wanted to start off Day 4, that's for sure.
>Matt:  (BOVV) +24 330
