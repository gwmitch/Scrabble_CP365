>Quackle: HLOOTUY 8H YOUTH +30 30
>Bill: ABHIOTV 7G BOH +29 29
#note These will be the second and third lowest scoring plays of the game.
>Quackle: AEGKLLO K3 LEKGO.LA +76 106
#note Alternate spelling: KGOTLA.
>Bill: AIISTTV 11I VISTA +44 73
#note I'm going to blame amazement over Quackle's play for missing VITALIST and VITIATES. That, and I wanted to test whether LEKGOTLA took an S.
>Quackle: IIJMNRS J10 J.N +51 157
>Bill: ADEIMQT L1 QAID +56 129
>Quackle: IIMORSU 1L .UIM +45 202
#note So instead of getting 70 for the Q, I end up a measly +11 on the QAID/QUIM exchange.
>Bill: ?EMNRTU 13G MUNsTER +84 213
#note MOUNTER scores one more, but putting the U under H12 instead of O probably makes this better anyway.
>Quackle: INORRSS L7 S.OR.I. +34 236
#note Well done, Quackle. That cleans up your rack nicely (I'm such a gracious competitor).
>Bill: BEEFINT 14B BENEFIT +96 309
#note Saw it as a nine with -ED for 88 first, briefly considered sticking with it considering how much this gives back, but eight points was too much.
>Quackle: CENRRSZ 15G REZ +50 286
>Bill: AEFITWY 13C FAW +35 344
#note Annoyed that I couldn't get anything to fit with the Y at 15D, I decided to just try to set it up again for next turn. I had to check whether WIFY was playable in Collins, which would've been good for 69 (insert sophomoric joke here).
>Quackle: ACNORST 6B CONTRAS +77 363
>Bill: AEILNTY 15A LINY +53 397
#note Yuck, missed INNATELY. LINEA(LI)TY is best. I really need to find INNATELY, even in a meaningless game against Quackle. I would've thought longer in a real game.
>Quackle: ?CEIINO E4 CO.INInE +86 449
#note RETINOIC is the CSW-only 2x2.
>Bill: AADEERT B5 A.ERATED +63 460
>Quackle: AGLRSVX 7A V.X +38 487
>Bill: AEEOPPW 9G PAW +35 495
#note A1 OPEPE is the standout play that I unfortunately haven't played/studied enough Collins to know. Given what Quackle has, it should win about 1/3 of the time (Quackle would play either VALI, RAG at 9G or UGALIS at N8 - VALI would lose to 2/6 of the tiles that could be last in the bag, RAG would also lose to 2/6, and UGALIS would lose to 1/6 and tie three others, so UGALIS would be best for total win fraction IF Quackle knows what my leave is after OPEPE, but since it doesn't it's simming VALI and RAG neck and neck and playing VALI on Champ player). I award myself unrealized potential style points for seeing that PADUASOY would be possible if I played off at least three tiles keeping PA and miraculously drew DUA.
>Quackle: AGILRSU D8 UG +10 497
>Bill: DEEEOOP A1 POOED +30 525
#note EPODE for two more. Either the duck has the bingo or it doesn't. Not much I can do.
>Quackle: AEGILRS N7 GRAILES +78 575
#note Of course it has the bingo.
>Quackle:  (DEE) +8 583
