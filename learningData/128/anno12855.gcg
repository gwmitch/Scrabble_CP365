>Matthew_Larocque: EGGIOOP 8G GOGO +12 12
#note Gees are meh, and this is pretty defensive.
>Eric_Tran: OW J6 WO. +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHILPP K5 PEH +26 38
>Eric_Tran: MU L7 MU +13 27
>Matthew_Larocque: ACIKLOP L1 POLKA +32 70
#note I wasn't sure if this was a good idea because of Eric only playing off 2 tiles, but I also kind of need to get lucky to win.
>Eric_Tran: IX M2 XI +31 58
>Matthew_Larocque: CIIIORV -VIIIRC +0 70
#note I was gonna play VI(G)OR but I didn't think it was quite enough points. I kept an O just in case Eric happened to leave the OX spot open. If Eric does play there I want a decent counter on the TWS. The sim is pretty indecisive, but Exch. IIIV seems to have the edge.
>Eric_Tran: AIOT N1 IOTA +31 89

>Eric_Tran: BTU 9M BUT +23 112
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFLNTW N8 W.D +16 134
#note I thought about (U)NFELT, was a little concerned about opening like that with the score fairly tight.
>Eric_Tran: IIRV 10J VIRI. +21 133
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFFLNT 11K FEN +29 163
#note Sets up my other F, but it's probably not going to stay open.
>Eric_Tran: ?AEINSU 12F INUlASE +76 209
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEFLTT 13L FELT +21 184
#note Behind, so setting up an S hook (assuming I can draw one).
>Eric_Tran: ENZ F10 ZE.N +33 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEESTY H11 C.TEY +30 214
#note One bingo in this rack, I didn't know it, but it doesn't play anyways.
>Eric_Tran: ACHI O11 AI.CH +33 275
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEINS G2 rEDESI.N +62 276
#note Or rEEDIN(G)S, which I didn't know. I thought there might be a fancy 8 with the S on ZE(I)N, but nada. Everything plays through or to the G. Finding this set a lucky sequence in motion.
>Eric_Tran: AIRT 1H ATRI. +21 296
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLMORS 3B GOMER.LS +74 350
#note Haha, GORMLE(S)S! This is one of the more recent bingos I've picked up, so it was nice to draw it when I needed it.
>Eric_Tran: AELN -  +0 296
#note I definitely wasn't expecting that. I actually forgot that this word had alternate spellings, I guess Eric was unsure about them as well. Huge break.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDEIY 2A BAYED +40 390
>Eric_Tran: AELN 4A LANE +30 326
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIJRRS 14C JARS +29 419
#note Horrible whiff. I seriously think I saw RAJAS and then questioned if it took an S or not. Like DJINN but not DJINNI. Except RAJ and RAJA have different meanings.....
>Eric_Tran: DNOTV 5E OV.N +14 340
>Matthew_Larocque: AIR 1A AR +23 442
#note I missed (l)IRA and wouldn't have been very sure of AR(E)I(C).
