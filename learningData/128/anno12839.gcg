>Daniel: ADIQ 8G QADI +28 28
>Matt: AEEJKNV 7H JAKE +35 35
>Daniel: EV K5 VE. +12 40
#note This board is already looking ugly.
>Matt: EFILNOV 9J FIVE +21 56
#note I wouldn't imagine EILNV to be that powerful of a leave.  
>Daniel: ETX 8M TEX +32 72
>Matt: ILLNORT 9E LOIR +27 83
#note He held, then muttered something about learning the Collins 4's and accepted the play.
>Daniel: CELRU 8A LUCRE +26 98
>Matt: ILNOOTY 10B NOILY +34 117
#note ONLY is a very nice fit for 36, but I'l take the better leave for 2 fewer points.
>Daniel: LOST 10H LOST +32 130
>Matt: AAAGOOT -AAGOO +0 117
#note Ew, let's try again.
>Daniel: AEM 7M AME +23 153
>Matt: ?AORTTW 6M WAT +32 149
>Matt: ?BDORST (challenge) +5 154
#note Look at that magic 3x3 square.  I could have played TAW for the same points., but I had a hunch he might not know WATE# and challenge my play after his little LOIR# monologue.
>Daniel: DIU 11A DUI +8 161
#note He opens things up right as I'm ready to pounce.
>Matt: ?BDORST 12C STROBeD +71 225
#note Yay!  I always guessed this word when cardboxing BDEORST for TWL, and just couldn't believe it wasn't good.  This definitely put me in a good mood, and reminded me that I was playing in the right division for me.
>Daniel: CIP H12 .PIC +21 182
>Matt: AEINNTT 13H .ATINE +22 247
#note So I had promised Katie that if I had a chance to play NANITE/S#, I would (A Stargate Atlantis inside joke).  Here I had the perfect chance and he blocks it!  
>Daniel: BDERY A11 .ERBY +36 218
>Matt: AEINORT 15H .REATION +83 330
#note LOL, second time I've miraculously drawn into OTARINE#/NOTAIRE#.
>Daniel: AP 14N PA +18 236
>Matt: ?ADEGHZ 11K ADZ +32 362
#note Uh, I should play this at 12L.
>Daniel: EFN N10 FEN +28 264
#note And that's why.
>Matt: ?EGGHOW 12M E.G +18 380
#note Didn't see any reason to open up the top of the board for him.  However there's another G left, so something like YEGG will give me better flexibility.  There is the option to just exchange, the pool is much better than my rack.
>Daniel: OS 5I SO. +6 270
>Matt: ?GGHHOW I5 .H.. +8 388
#note I though I was being clever here, but it's going to be a struggle for me in the endgame.
>Daniel: M J4 M. +4 274
>Matt: ?GGHOUW 3J eUGH +18 406
#note w 3.  Well there are a lot of bingoes in that pool, so I need to block ro.  With the D's and M's gone this should do the trick, and if he bingoes to LUCRE sobeit.  
>Daniel: EINNORS 4L ION +17 291
#note So he did have RONNIES#, another name for a mustache.  
>Matt: AGOUW 2M WAG +23 429
>Daniel: ENRS 14A .RENS +14 305
>Daniel:  (OU) +4 309
