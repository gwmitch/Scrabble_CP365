#note fishing the B gives me a shot at NOTIFIER or NOTIFIED, but mike will block just about for sure - a sharper move would be fishing the F at 6B going for STROBILI or OBLIGATI, both of which are hard to see. in fact, that's why I didn't think of them.
>McFrentz: ADGIJNO 3A .ING +10 339
#note his most stylish way of blocking my bingo is with ninja setting up two out spots.
>JD: ?FIIORT D1 FI. +11 448
#note my best sequence of TORII at 14D is a whole 13 points better, setting up a big scoring out and blocking his biggest play of TAJ in the process.
