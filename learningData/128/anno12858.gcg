>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIOTX 8G FOX +26 26
#note So I've already won once against Eric, but in order to win the tournament I need to win against him a second time. My record in final games for first place is pretty bad, as is my record against Eric. So of course this seemed like an impossible task. I start off by missing FIXATE. 
>Eric_Tran: AGHNO 7F HOGAN +30 30
>Matthew_Larocque: AABDEIT 9G TAE +27 53
#note Scores well, somewhat defensive, and sets up my D.
>Eric_Tran: JOT 6E JOT +26 56
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDILNU 10I DAUB +21 74
#note He will probably get easy points next turn but my options are pretty limited. UNBID doesn't take an S which I just discovered, so it does well in the sim.
>Eric_Tran: AKRU 6I RAKU +27 83
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNUUVV -ILNUUVV +0 74
#note Not feeling great after this draw. I just throw all seven in to maximise the chances of a blank or at least an S.
>Eric_Tran: EQY K9 Q.EY +32 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEORTT 13E DOTTERs +75 149
#note Well, that worked out....this rack has 8 sevens. Only 2  of them play here and I didn't know TETRODE.
>Eric_Tran: IN K4 IN. +14 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELOST 3G LAcTOSE +72 221
#note Yeesh, two blank bingos in a row. That's pretty much the kind of luck I needed to not roll over and die. I thought over the countless bingos and ended up playing this just because you can't fit -ER -ED -ES due to the L. As Curran helpfully pointed out, TALcOSE gives me a couple more points. Yeah I actually forgot that anagram.... :/ I kind of like SkATOLE too but I often skip the K when looking for bingos.
>Eric_Tran: VV -VV +0 129
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEIVY H1 BE.DY +39 260
#note I flaked out of BEVY/DAUBY because I wasn't nearly sure enough on DAUBY. In retrospect that wouldn't have been a good play anyways, just because something like Z(E)PS would be nasty.
>Eric_Tran: EEINRSS 10A SEINERS +69 198
#note Haha. This brought back a funny memory. I had the same rack against Eric in a previous game. And I despite knowing the 3 anagrams, I overthought the position and randomly played *RESINES. No, it didn't stay on the board.
>Matthew_Larocque: EILOPUV A5 OVULE. +27 287
#note Well that was a painful miss. I didn't actually know PLUVIO(S)E for a wicked 98. But I did know PLO(S)IVE for 48. I can sort of forgive myself for playing a little nervously given the situation. But the game isn't over yet and all I'm thinking is "don't choke, damn it!".
>Eric_Tran: OWW 14D WOW +33 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ILMNPSZ 15F LIMP +30 317
#note Picked up the Z, Eric's play helps my rack a lot. I would need to make a colossal error to lose this now.
>Eric_Tran: EEIR 12J E.RIE +18 249
#note Ugh. He plays this and I can't remember if it takes an S hook. Why, I don't know. It's another spelling for AERIE. EYRIR is the one that doesn't because it has the strange pluralization AURAR.
>Matthew_Larocque: AINNPSZ B2 ZIPS +32 349
#note Starting to choke. I could put my S on EYRIE, but I don't study very much. Playing just Z(I)N is far less stupid than this. 
>Eric_Tran: EHIR 15A HIRE +30 279
>Matthew_Larocque: AACCNNO C1 CAN +25 374
#note Time's wasting, so I just try to milk the Z for points. I didn't even know CAECA haha. 12D CACA would have been nice.
>Eric_Tran: FM E9 F.M +16 295
>Matthew_Larocque: AACGNOU D2 GNU +24 398
#note The leave isn't pretty but it gives me enough of a lead that can withstand a bingo. However he does have two lanes to work with so the sooner I take them out the better. I didn't have much time to think it out so I just went for the points and crossed my fingers.
>Eric_Tran: AEILV D7 VEI.AL +29 324
>Matthew_Larocque: AACGIOT M11 C.AO +12 410
#note L1 for 22, or maybe take the Q spot.
>Eric_Tran: DINR L8 DI. +19 343
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIT 14L G.AT +10 420
#note TA(J), L1 spot is still there too.
>Eric_Tran: NR M3 .RN +3 346
#note He missed C9 R(I)N.
>Eric_Tran:  (I) +2 348
#note Not the best game I've ever played, but a win is a win I guess. The funny thing is that in the first early bird, the bottom seed (Noella) won the tournament. Then the next day, whatever kind of otherwordly luck she had must have been passed on to me - I ended up winning the second early bird while being the bottom seed. *shrugs*
