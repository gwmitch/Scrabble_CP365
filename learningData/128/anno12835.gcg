#note ZEIN would work here, but keeping the Z and playing JOINED/ENJOY is a neat idea.

>JD: GIIJNOP F6 JI. +26 151
#note KOJI is the same idea but scoring a few extra points

#note doping seemed to keep the board nicely under wraps. also, for some reason I was convinced it didn't take an S. DOPINGS/PONGIDS is the duo of bingoes.

#note trying to hit KEX/XU, I could also block the 3x3 with AULD.

>JD: AISTTWX A10 AW.ITS +27 289
#note I thought this was a dumb play at the time, but it sims fine. blocking the 3x3 is good. WAST is a smart alternative way of doing this - setting up a backup EX spot.

#note not an awful choice, anything that leaves outs for next turn should be pretty good.
