>Matthew_Larocque: CNORRST H7 C.R. +6 53
#note Should have played CR(Y) instead to set myself up.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: UUUVVY -UUUVVY +0 62
>Matthew_Larocque: GNORSTT L6 TOG +11 64
#note Maybe TONG for more turnover. But if I'm going to have a consonant heavy leave, it might as well be NRST. I forgot GROT was a word.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CEIM M3 MICE +22 84
>Matthew_Larocque: NRSTTUY N6 RUTTY +27 91
#note Haha, why did I play this instead of RUNTY. I saw (D)UTY but it seemed like a lot of points to drop.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AE 8L .A.E +15 99
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENORS 11B cANOERS +74 165
#note Either way I'm giving him letters to play through, so I figured I might as well not create a hotspot by putting a vowel under the TLS. Q likes cORNEAS/AMICE. I didn't even think of that.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFMUW 1H FUME. +33 248
#note So close to WAMEFOU! Not that it would play, anyways.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?EGRSTT 13B TaRGETS +74 187
#note This is actually his only bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEELNW 2F WAE +19 267
#note I wasted a crapload of time here. Most of my plays all sim very close so it probably didn't benefit me to waste minutes off my clock. Q says score a few more points playing WANE/WEAN.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEHOP 3C EPHOD +36 223
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIJLNR D1 JA.ER +44 311
#note I would assume JANE gives him a better chance to score big points.....
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AIV 14A VIA +17 240
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILNPW 15C LIPA +9 320
#note Just a purely defensive play, I didn't like it all that much. Neither does Quackle. But a bingo there would put me in a tough position so I can't really feel too bad for blocking.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: N F2 ..N +6 246
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIKNW 5C D.EK +29 349
#note I guess he could conceivably bingo by s-hooking JAPER, and 29 points is a lot on the current state of the board.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: V 3K V.. +8 254
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEILNW H13 .AW +18 367
#note Didn't want to do this but most everything is crappy. Maybe M10 ANEW?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AIOR 1A RIO.A +36 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILNN 4A GAN. +11 378
#note Damn! I was too afraid to play (W)EANLING just because I'm trying to break the habit of playing phonies at bad times. That would have been killer. Instead I choke and make a lame play.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BEHIINN -  +0 290
#note Omg he challenged!
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNS O2 LINES +14 392
#note I laugh when I see the S was the last letter in the bag and tell Juraj. Also, now I know LENIS and LENES are words.
