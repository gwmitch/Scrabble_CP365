>JD: GKNOORU 8D KORUN +28 28
#note My matchplay series with Jason KB, game 5, tied at 2-2
>Jason: AELTX 7F EXALT +42 42
>JD: EGOORWY I3 GROW.Y +28 56
#note my leave after wooly is much better in spite of growly being more defensive
>Jason: DEPRV 5G PR.VED +24 66
>JD: EHINOTY 4K HONEY +41 97
>Jason: DFINSTU E8 .UTFINDS +74 140
#note this looked kinda weird...but...
>JD: EEIMORT 15A TIRE.OME +149 246
#note I almost missed this, which would make it the second time that I've had this rack and missed a triple-triple through the S!! I did that at California Open 2010 when I played OSMETERIA instead
>Jason: ELV O1 LEV. +30 170
>JD: AEEGLOS D11 OLE +17 263
#note oh boy, I saw the VET spot but did not find OWE. that would've been a definite upgrade.
>Jason: AW 6I .AW +28 198
>JD: AEEGSTU G12 GEU. +8 271
#note tough rack, GEUM might be a little too paranoid. EGESTA is a fun alternative - I thought of GESTE after I'd hit my clock, but EGESTA may actually be good enough to be worth playing.
>Jason: AB C13 BA. +20 218
>JD: AAAEIST N1 AA +10 281
#note taigas for 18 sims almost with AA thanks to the two blanks being unseen!
>Jason: AQ A13 QA. +12 230
>JD: ACEINST 10B NIC.ATES +70 351
>Jason: ADELNST 14G .NSLATED +74 304
#note game losing mistake on my (jesse's) part for not challenging this! I just figured he would've played UNSALTED...
>JD: ?EGIJOR N10 JERI. +29 380
#note I am a big favorite already but playing JO at J2 makes me almost certain to bingo at some point...this isn't bad but it's definitely worse.
>Jason: DIZ L12 DI.Z +48 352
>JD: ?BCFGOR 6C CORF +31 411
#note in retrospect this was a game-losingly bad play. if I play BROCK or FROCK I block the last really good bingo lane - bingoes on column B will not score that much and will give me counter-plays. I should sacrifice the points. BROCK is nice because the F is more useful than the B.
>Jason: AIMNOST 3B ANTISMO. +78 430
#note my goodness, he's done it!
>JD: ?BGHIIU 2E BUHl +26 437
>Jason: ?EIOP K8 POIsE +15 445
#note given my rack he shouldn't go out...but this is a sure win!
>Jason:  (GII) +8 453
