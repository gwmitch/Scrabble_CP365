>Tasha_Asberry: DEISTTW 13A TWISTED +85 183
#note Had Noah not played his bingo on column I, I would have had a hard time choosing between TWISTED at 10I or 13A.  It tunrs out that it also plays at L8, which I didn't even notice.  I prefer playing it there.
>Noah_Walton: DEGMOOS 12I SMOOGED +84 201
>Noah_Walton: DEGMOOS --  -84 117
#note After the game, Noah said he shouldn't have played this.  I told him that he still made me pause because he played the word so fast.  I swear there wasn't five seconds between TWISTED and this.  (I'm totally going to start slapping down my intentional phonies like this.  I just got to work on my rating- credibility and all that- and keeping a straight face.)  

But I just wrote the alphagram down and the only seven (at first I was thinking of eights for some reason and couldn't think of any) that popped out at me with those letters was DOGDOMS and so I figured that SMOOGED couldn't be good.  I told Noah this after this game and he said he thought of DOGDOMS too.  Great minds and all that.
>Tasha_Asberry: AACEFLY B10 FLA.Y +44 227
#note Before I played this, I tried to predict Noah's next move since I know his rack.  I figured that if I were him, I'll be playing MOG at either 10J or 14F.  I would PREFER that he play at 10J, but let's see...
>Noah_Walton: DEGMOOS 14F MOG +25 142
#note Dang it.
>Tasha_Asberry: ACEHIKR 4F CHA.KIER +86 313
#note Annoying fact:  I saw HACKLIER before CHALKIER.  "Hey, I have HACKLIER.  Nah...don't be silly.  That aint a word."   
>Noah_Walton: DEOSVW 15G WOVE +46 188
#note Okay, that wasn't TOO bad.  
>Tasha_Asberry: BBDEEFR K3 F.BBED +28 341
#note It was driving me nuts that I forgot to write my rack here.  I know I had an R because I remember thinking of playing FIBBER instead of FIBBED.  The last letter must have been an  E  because I thankfully wrote "BRIEF or BRIEFED?" on my scoresheet. I also vaguely remember wondering if FIBERED is good.  

After I gave up on a high-scoring five at 14J (missing sim winner FREED), I was going back and forth between BRIEFED or BRIEF until I suddenly notice there's a wide open I staring me in the face.  I turn over five tiles, score 28 points, keep a good leave, and it's now going to be hard for Noah to bingo on this board.  If he bingos, it's more likely to be on column A or column M.   I'd PREFER column M.

>Tasha_Asberry: AEINPRU O7 UNREPAI. +86 427
#note GREENLIT phenomenon all over again.  I was dangerously close to missing this.  I knew there were two bingos in ADEINPRU and I couldn't remember either of them.  "UNPAIRED maybe... and PURADINE*...nah...UNPAIRED sounds phony as hell... PRUDAINE*...nah....EPIDURAN* and UNREPAID...nah..wait a second... UNREPAID!!"  I definitely need to review high prob stuff.

#note I took a long time here.  I seriously considered ignoring the bingo and just playing a small block on column M to try to avoid the possibility of an atrocious end rack.  I looked at the pool and decided that Noah must have the goodies on his side.  I guessed him at ?AENPRS.   I knew that if I take the bingo, I'm probably going to end up eating the Q.  But I decide to just play LETTING because it's better for me that way.  He can't make any setups and there's going to be no bingoing out.  But of course, I couldn't help giggling to myself at the possibility that maybe just maybe I'M gonna draw the goodies out of the bag and HE has OOQ  on his rack right now.  I'd PREFER he have OOQ than ?AENPRS.

>Tasha_Asberry: OQRSSZ L13 Z.O +13 541
#note You'd think with all the time Noah gave me, I'll see H4 AZO.  But no, instead of doing something useful with HIS time (like, you know, scanning the board looking for the best spot to play my Z), I started daydreaming, doodling on my scoresheet, and playing Hangman.  

Also...this is an hilarious end rack.  
>Noah_Walton: ?ENPS 1D PiNES +33 333
>Noah_Walton:  (QRSS) +26 359
#note This was literally the craziest game I ever had.  I mean, what was up with all the bingos?  Noah was a great sport, though! Sweet guy!  If I were in his position, I would have started foaming at the mouth right around CHALKIER.
