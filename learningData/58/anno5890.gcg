#note This is an example of me trying to blunder a game away. I have to ignore the fact that my rack is ridiculous and just ensure that I win the game. I was pretty sure ricy was invalid, and I was reminded after that icy has no hooks.

#note My clock literally hit 0 after this play - I almost didn't count the score in time. I really need to stop flirting with the clock so badly. Hairnet is obviously where it's at.
