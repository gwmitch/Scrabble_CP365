#note Lately I've been wondering if the only way I'll ever get good is to attain Dave Wiegand's mastery of the dictionary.  Props to anyone who knows the 13900 probability bingo in here without resorting to Zyzzyva or their Franklin.   I looked at this rack and went, "Huh?"  Anyway - this play is the best non-bingo choice.

#note Whiffed on the same play at 9C and D3 GOT.  D3 GOT wins the sim; don't know why I didn't see that, or any of the better plays.
>Mary_Pastore: AK 8A KA +22 120
>Jim_Burlant: EINOPRT H8 .IPTERON +86 118
#note Best bingo, back up to 40% winning chances.   Mary held me for a long time on this play.  I was hoping she'd challenge...but, alas, she  let it go.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEEFOU 11B FADEOU. +22 140
#note After Mary released me, I had not even drawn my first tile when the Q came down, and I started to get a very bad feeling about this game.  Post-game, I asked her about this and she confirmed my hunch:  she said that she let DIPTERON go because it gave her the Q play, otherwise she would have challenged - unsuccessfully.  Not one opponent hit me with a word I didn't know this entire tournament, yet the one time I've obviously put one down, it gives her a 34-point Q play she wouldn't have otherwise had.  Ugh.   FADEOUT sims best, btw.

>Jim_Burlant: CCEIIIR 11J ICIER +23 163
#note Saw 2A CIVIE but couldn't think of CIVIC, which wins the sim by 4 pts and sims at 29% winning chances.  While ICIER does sim second at 27%, CIVIC would have delayed - but not necessarily prevented - the ensuing carnage, as she already had the blank.

>Jim_Burlant: BCFINST L10 F.B +16 179
#note Nothing quite like the helpless feeling of having to leave hot spots open because you don't have a play on them.  This play is a very questionable choice - if I was going to fish off F and B, I should have played at F10, and that fish sims quite well.  No idea why I played here.  Anyway, as poor as this choice was, the only saving grace was that it didn't affect the outcome of this game a whole lot.   L8 FICIN wins the sim; I'd rather unload the B.
>Mary_Pastore: AEEILST 2C .EALIEST +65 323
#note Mary initially put down something down the O column when she realized she couldn't make the play...then she saw the V.   Best bingo is EGALITES 4B.  Regardless, she's now over 99% winning chances.  And I'm pretty much dead.  If I had found GOT back on turn 2, she doesn't get this play and I still have some small chance (her non-bingo options win 95% instead of 99.6% according to the sim).
>Jim_Burlant: CIJNRST H1 J.T +30 209
#note Best play, at 0.4% winning chances.  Woo hoo.
>Mary_Pastore: LNOOY O6 LOONY +48 371
#note I expected her to get 30 - 36 there, but I didn't expect this.  Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: CEINRSV -V +0 209
#note Enough of these low-prob draws already - sheesh!  Anyway - I knew the duck wouldn't like this, but I didn't care - I was fixated on another bingo and didn't think I had 2 more turns to try and build a rack.  Quackle says I'm at 0.01% winning chances with best play.  Honestly, how do I have any chance at all?  If she passes 3 straight turns and I hit 3 straight bingos?

>Jim_Burlant: CEIINRS A1 CRI.E +27 236
#note This tournament has to be setting a record for the most bingos I don't know making it into my racks.  If I drew an A or E I'd have known the bingos...but all I saw were 8's that didn't play and I didn't know SERICIN, which sims at 0.04% winning chances.   This rack was the last straw; I've now given up on trying to put the bingo together and am just turning tiles to end the massacre as quickly as possible.
>Mary_Pastore: AEILMRT 5F MALTIER +75 466
#note The hits just keep on coming.  And if I know SERICIN, she doesn't get this down.
>Jim_Burlant: EILNPSU D11 .UP +12 248
#note Of course, now that I get a bingo I know, it doesn't play.  Again.

#note About the only good break this game beyond drawing into DIPTERON.
