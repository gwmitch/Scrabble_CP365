#note N9 TULA(D)I 18.  Everything looks pretty ugly though, so I decided to throw everything back but IG, hoping to draw into at least RENEWING.  Perhaps I shoulda kept the A, for RENEWALS, too.  Bad exchange, bad play.
>Dave_Leifer: MOP 14M MOP +24 128
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGIOS 15E GEnOISE +80 223
#note Bad play paid off.  I wasn't sure of the hook, but I figured he wouldn't challenge.
>Dave_Leifer: ANT 15N NA +22 150
#note He put down TA first.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGILTT 14F DIT +18 241
#note Shouldn't have missed GLITTE(R), but in hindsight, it's for the best.  No pesky hook.
>Dave_Leifer: ORTY 7B TROY +26 176
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGGLMT 6A ME +10 251
#note Q wants me to play M9 GEM.  I've gotta block S(TROY).
>Dave_Leifer: AQ 11J .Q.A +26 202
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGGLT N7 GLEDE +25 276
#note Played a little bit too fast.  The X should've been a concern, but I'd rather not give him too many ways back in.
>Dave_Leifer: AX O8 AX +42 244
#note Yup.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEGITY 12F GAYE. +18 294
#note If only that M were elsewhere, I'd have "the quality of being MEGA".  So instead I take out one of the remaining lanes.
>Dave_Leifer: DFNOU 13B FONDU +24 268
#note Nice fit.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEIINPT 12A PINE +29 323
#note Almost didn't play this.  Would have hated for him to play a -E or -E(S/R)T bingo on row 9.
>Dave_Leifer: AKS B10 KA..S +44 312
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEHIIT 8A HAET +36 359
#note Pretty much puts it away.  (Though he tells me he was looking for a C for CUSTO(M) which would've made it interesting.
>Dave_Leifer: EORTV 9G VER. +29 341
#note He vacillated between playing the O or not.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACCIIL 5K C.oCI +16 375
#note Missed A1 CILIuM 30, and H1 CLIm(B) 24.  Was happy to see this, giving me a decent out in two spots.
