#note Since he didn't hang an I or an R, Quackle's first choice is to fish off one of the T's with G8 ET.  This choice, while sacrificing 3 points, does work out quite nicely.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: EORRSTU C2 ROUTERS +75 99
>Jim_Burlant: AEFINOT 5A FE.ATION +72 91
#note Best.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: EERV A5 .EVER +33 132
>Jim_Burlant: BGINPSU 1A BUG +27 118
#note Best.  BU(R)PING 2A, PUB 4B, and  PIGNUS 1A also worth consideration.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: AILT 2B T.AIL +18 150
>Jim_Burlant: IINOPRS H2 PIO. +7 125
#note Weak.  Saw PINON and convinced myself it was bogus, didn't think of INION, and only knew ORPIN as a 6 with an E on the end.  H1 PINON wins the sim.  
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ABT 9E BAT +20 170
>Jim_Burlant: EEINRSV 10G ENVIERS +68 193
#note Terrible - blind to the board.  3G VINERIES wins the sim, which I didn't see.  This choice puts me up at 53% winning chances.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ADIRWZ 11B WIZARD +46 216
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEJMNO D11 .ONED +34 227
#note Didn't know DEMIJOHN and figured I should play aggressively since I had the blank; I figured the J could wait since that Z was begging to be hooked.  Best non-bingo choice is JO 4G 18.  I take a pretty big hit equity-wise for this reckless choice.  
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ILOY 15D .OILY +27 243
>Jim_Burlant: ?HJKMNU 13B JU.K +30 257
#note Yuck.  k5 JUNKMEN!  Interestingly, despite giving up 45 scoreboard points, I only give up 10 equity here.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: GI B13 .IG +22 265
>Jim_Burlant: ?HMNORS K4 HORMoN.S +98 355
#note Best bingo, other choices being HORSEMEN or MOORHENS.   All the 2x2's sim around 93% winning chances.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: AFX L3 FAX +45 310
>Jim_Burlant: CDEOPQT F14 Q. +31 386
#note Duck prefers M2 DEPOT.  Clunky rack or not, with this lead I'd rather unload the Q for 31.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: AHN M2 NAH +31 341
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDEOPT M8 DE.POTiC +76 462
#note Luckbox!  Other choice is PO(S)TCoDE M8, the sim winner.  
>Cesar_Jaramillo: DEI 15L I.ED +24 365
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGNOY N1 GOY +27 489
#note Considered playing EA(T)EN 13K to block both his outs (CULTI and LUCID), but then started wondering "what if he blocks my out with NU?"  My brain was hurting trying to figure out the end games, so I just played off GOY (the second half of the out in two I had played EATEN), missing the much better YOGA.
