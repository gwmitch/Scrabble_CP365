#note bob took a while with his last play, and i had a feeling he was setting up an S hook.  Probably paranoia on my part.  Q thinks my move is a real horror show. It likes O12 AYIN or 2J YAPON, which I whiffed on - I'd have played it in a shot had i seen it.  It also likes 2I ANOPIA which I saw but discounted as too risky.  I'm a bit embarrassed by how bad this play is - normally i dont play this scared, but i just got a feeling...

#note give it 1000 iterations and this wins the sim clearly.

>james: AACFINV 13B VAC +25 315
#note J2 VAC for the same number of points wins by a whopping 6% more - i guess it blocks the S hook. My play is 2nd. I'll be honest- i played this too fast and didn't see the J2 spot. I would have gone there for sure.

#note glad to see this sims best.  my logic was that there is still the JQS? unseen and I could get hit with some bigtime stuff and be out of this game. I need to score and open a bit here...... or is my thinking wrong?  Did the sim have other reasons for doing this?

#note i dont know the rest of bob's rack, but he had these by this time. I didnt have time to chat it over with him completely.
>james: AADEINT B9 DATI.E +24 369
#note My play sims at 100% win. that's nice.  I don't believe there is a win, though Q says that the following win 100% in equity order:  J1 ADIT, B12 A(V)ID, B11 DI(V)AN, B9 NATI(V)E B11 DATI(V)E.  
>bob: ?DEEIJR A8 JEfE +36 388
#note i was obviously hoping bob would fluff his lines - he didnt, though A7 DJIn is 3pts better equity wise.  - I think my best sequence from the turn before is J1 ADIT. bob then plays B11 JIVED and i then play C9 NAE - i lose by one. Can anyoen see anything better?
>james: AN I1 AN +9 378
#note best outplay.  I'm glad as i took 8 minutes on the last 2 moves and couldnt find anything better.
