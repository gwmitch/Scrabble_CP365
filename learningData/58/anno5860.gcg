#note Mistake.  If I'm going first and playing for equity, this is definitely the right play, and nothing else sims within 5 points.  But given that she just exchanged 2, I should have taken the defense-first approach and played something truly off-the-wall like VUM 8H to limit her options to 60-point airballs that would give me something back at one of the triples (unless she could find an 8 using V, U, or M).  
>Deborah_Gaudier: GIILNRT E6 TR.ILING +68 68
#note The instant she put this down I realized the error I had made by not taking a more defensive position on my opening rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AACOTXY D3 COXA +28 54
#note 12D ONYX wins the sim, with F13 1.2 pts behind that and this choice 1 point behind OXY.  I didn't like keeping the Y but felt more comfortable with that than keeping duplicated A's.

>Jim_Burlant: AETUWYY 4G YAW +24 78
#note I dumped UV 2 turns ago; I'm chastising myself for my opening rack goof; now I'm looking at UWYY.  Safe to say I'm rattled, and it shows in this poor play.  I was too concerned about this hook; I should have been more concerned about the X front-overlap.  YEW or YAW C4 are the right plays here, with YEW C4 winning the sim, presumably due to keeping the A for the easy VOWED front hook.
>Deborah_Gaudier: INZ J2 ZIN +42 122
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: EILNTUY K3 TYIN +30 108
#note Phony hook to make a strong play - YAWN doesn't take Y.  Sim winner is 12D UNITY, at 30% winning chances.  This play stacks up very well in the sim, only giving up 1-1/2 points to the sim winner.
>Deborah_Gaudier: ET F5 ET +9 131

#note Didn't know the best choices (PULING 12A, PICUL, or PUGGIER), couldn't see much else.
>Deborah_Gaudier: AAB D11 BAA +21 152
>Jim_Burlant: EIJLORU C13 JEU +42 170
#note Clearly best (nothing else sims within 7 points of this), and now I'm back in the game.  Despite my 18-point lead, I'm still only at 45% winning chances.
>Deborah_Gaudier: DEFLT 15A FL.TED +33 185
>Jim_Burlant: GILLOOR G7 O.OLI +20 190
#note Best, wins 35%.

>Jim_Burlant: EFGHLRU I6 HE +18 208
#note Once again, a position where the only good play is one that I don't know.  FUGLE H11 wins the sim just shy of 50%, with none of the other choices coming near 32.  I didn't see UGH 7J (probably should have been my choice), and those 4 unseen S's made plays like GULF 7K (of Quackle's favorites) less than desirable.  Saw PUGH L5 and didn't like it because I'd play for 16 and give up at least 21 on the return (and more if she hit HOKE or HOPE).  Not to mention that it created a line for an easy 7 that would give me nothing back.  In short, I couldn't find anything I liked and gambled that, with 7 E's unseen I could still land one.  I recall I was feeling very tense, which didn't help my cause, either.  This wins 33% or so and takes a huge hit in the sim to FUGLE, the sim winner.

>Jim_Burlant: EGILORU L5 .ULI +9 217
#note Now that was a break.  Quackle prefers any number of rather dangerous plays (I9 ERUGO, 14F ERUGO, 7k GUIRO).  Granted, she doesn't have anything this turn but the last thing I need is to create a hotspot where an unseen H can burn me for 40+ if she lands it and I don't.  Wasn't thrilled with GOER as a leave, but again, I saw no really good options in this position.  I was just relieved I could unload the U.   Her lost turn gave me the extra turn I needed to grind through the mostly self-inflicted clunk overload, and the game turned on this.

>Jim_Burlant: AEGHNOR 8K H..GE +27 244
#note K9 HOGAN, F12 EGAD, F12 AGED all sim within 0.2 pts of each other for sim winner honors.  This play sims within 1-1/2 points of those 3 choices.  I preferred the points.  I'm now approaching 50% winning chances for the first time this game.

>Jim_Burlant: ?AINOPR O1 AtROPIN. +80 324
#note Amazing drawing a blank can do.  I've gone from 48% to 92% winning chances.   PINAfOR(E) is just as good here.  
>Deborah_Gaudier: CEU I9 ECU +11 251
#note Incorrectly scored as 9.

#note LUCKBOX!!!!!!    As for what wins the sim - this, or any of the other 18 bingos that play in this same spot.
