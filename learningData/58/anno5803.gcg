#note Quackle prefers playing short with this rack with 9C GOD; I didn't think AGIL was anything to write home about so I just tried to turn as much of the rack as possible.  GIGOL(O) would have been a better candidate for that, but I couldn't think of it.

#note Best, nothing else comes close.
>Richard_Johnson: ADINTY N5 DAINTY +31 102
>Jim_Burlant: CEHIOSY 8L YO.I +33 73
#note Best, with CONY 8L and 8K CHINO also being worth consideration.
>Richard_Johnson: PZ L4 Z.P +28 130
#note Didn't know at the time there was an orphaned 7 in this rack, which is just as well.  I didn't look closely enough at the O column - while it scores decently and leaves a good combo, it doesn't change the fact that this is a BAD miss that has a major impact on how this game plays out.  There is no way I should have missed ETCHES O10.
>Jim_Burlant: CEEHNST 10B CHEST +27 100
#note While I only saw homeless 8's and didn't know there was a homeless 7 in this rack, this is a very bad miss.  While this scores decently and leaves a decent combination, there is no excuse for not seeing ETCHES O10, which wins 32% compared to this play's 25%.

#note Too fishy, not looking to score.  D1 WANE!

>Jim_Burlant: ?AAENSV C10 .AVE +20 136
#note Quackle prefers A6 plays - I preferred to open up easy S hooks seeing that I was sitting on S?.  Punishment for this choice was swift.  
>Richard_Johnson: DEEORTU 12A DE.OUTER +80 246
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEINS 14B ENtASIA +77 213
#note Though I only trail by 33 points after the bingo, quackle only puts my winning chances at 12%. 14A AmNESIA wins the sim by a  handful of points.  I wasn't thrilled with this but couldn't think of  AMNESIA or ANEMIAS,  which would have been better plays.  
>Richard_Johnson: BELRU 15H BLUER +36 282
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIQTV A6 AVE +20 233
#note Oh joy, the Q.  My thought was that, with the open U on row 2, a q play could wait; worst case I could draw into something like aeiqrst and I'd dump the q cheap or play  it on the next turn if I had to.  Quackle prefers A5 QAT.  Best play is at 5% winning chances now.
>Richard_Johnson: ACEHRS O10 ARCHES +47 329
>Jim_Burlant: EIIQRRT -IQR +0 233
#note Punishment for missing ETCHES when I played CHEST.  Saw the obvious Q plays and the problem with them was that (a) they broke up too much of the rack and (b) game him a wide-open shot at row 1.  I suspected he would leave row 2 alone if I did, and this is what came to pass.
>Richard_Johnson: DFGI K11 FIDG. +20 349
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILRTW 7M W.T +21 254
#note Interesting sim result here.  This is the highest valuation play, but quackle claims its winning chances (10%) are slightly less than half those of WILT 12J.  How?  Regardless, this play gets the job done.
>Richard_Johnson: KOPR M10 PORK +28 377
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFIILR 2A F.sILIER +62 316
#note UGLIFIER 2B scores 6 more, but it's window dressing on the spread.  Too many poor plays for me combined with him having the right rack at the right time for lots of the game.
