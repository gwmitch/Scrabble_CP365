#note First game of the morning, I'm guessing the morning coffee hasn't quite kicked in yet.  EJEcTOR!  REsOJET!   
>Betsey_Wood: ?AEHRTU 7H HAuTEUR +69 69
#note Best bingo here is OUTHEARd or OUTHEARs H8.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEERTT 6B RETrEAT +66 86
#note Didn't know the S hook to HAUTEUR (thought it was an adjective) and couldn't find the 8's with the triplicated T.  Yuck.  Hoping she doesn't have a P.  Best play here is O3 RETAsTE or K5 TATTEREd.
>Betsey_Wood: AMZ L4 MAZ. +30 99
>Jim_Burlant: AAAISTU -AAU +0 86
#note Too fixated on rack grooming herel.  3L AA 20 wins the sim.
>Betsey_Wood: IKO M3 KOI +20 119
>Jim_Burlant: ADEISTT N5 TA.DIEST +66 152
#note How's about at E4 for 16 more points?  Guess it didn't register with me that I was looking at a blank R - about the only thing I can think of in terms of why I didn't see the obvious 2x2.
>Betsey_Wood: EGRV C2 VERG. +18 137
>Jim_Burlant: EHLNPPR 11J HELP. +20 172
#note A6 PERP, A6 PREP win the sim.  
>Betsey_Wood: ELSUY O1 YULES +31 168
>Jim_Burlant: AINOPRX A6 POX +45 217
#note N1 OX wins the sim by a hair.  Despite my blunderous play I'm at 72% winning chances here.
>Betsey_Wood: AEILNST 10D ENTAILS +68 236
#note Best bingo is E5 TrENAILS.  I'm guessing that the blank R threw her as it probably threw me when I was looking for places to put down TARDIEST.  Betsey is at 51% winning chances here.
>Jim_Burlant: ADINRRW H10 .NWARD +42 259
#note Best.
>Betsey_Wood: Q 9M Q. +21 257
>Jim_Burlant: ADFINRV O12 AVID +30 289
#note Tossup between this play and L10 FLAVIN 26.  This play ties with FLAVIN on valuation and wins the sim by a fraction of a win-percentage point.  I'm at 61% winning chances now.
>Betsey_Wood: CNOY 14F CO.NY +24 281
>Jim_Burlant: AFGILNR 4A FA.ING +28 317
#note Nice rack, nowhere to put it.  Quackle's preference is 3J FLA(K) 27, which is a better play than this.  This choice comes in 3rd, at a loss of 7 points.  At the time, I was less worried about building a bingo rack than I was about forcing turnover, staying in the lead, and keeping the pressure on.    This play sims at 69% winning chances, with FLAK winning 73%.
>Betsey_Wood: CIU A1 CUI. +27 308
>Jim_Burlant: BBLORSU N14 BO +19 336
#note Quackle prefers 13J BUBO and 13J BULB; I preferred to leave myself a scorer and a vowel for th impending end game.  I'm at 69% winning chances now.
>Betsey_Wood: DIW E8 WI.D +16 324
>Jim_Burlant: BLMORSU 12A BLURS +29 365
#note Quackle prefers M13 MOB by quite a healthy margin; I prefer to force her to have to either play only one tile and score nothing if she wants me to empty the bag...or she's going to have to empty the bag to try and keep up with  me.  If the pool suggested she had numerous potential comebacks over 40 points I would not have made this play; the worst case comeback I saw was something like FO(L)IA 10B for 32, which would have depleted the pool of its scorers and still left me leading by 9.
>Betsey_Wood: ENO A12 .ONE +18 342
>Jim_Burlant: AEFMOOR 1K FOAM. +14 379
#note Didn't know FLEAM and felt the out-in-two was the best approach.  Didn't see FLORAE L10.  This play wins 100%, though at a loss of equity.
>Betsey_Wood: EGIIN 2C .IEING +12 354
>Betsey_Wood: EGIIN --  -12 342
#note Betsey told me after the game she had conceded the loss and figured she had next to nothing to lose to try and minimize spread if this turned out to be good.
>Jim_Burlant: EOR 15H .OER +12 391
#note Missed 7C ROE 27.
>Jim_Burlant:  (EGIIN) +12 403
