>Jim_Burlant: ?CDESUW 8G WUD +14 14
#note Here we go again - another low-probability bingo I've never seen - and may never see again - makes its way into my opening rack.  Today's gem is the 19000-probability gWEDUCS.  My play sims as the best non-bingo choice.
>Lee_Brooks: DEEEGIS -DEE +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEEENS 9A EsSENCE +66 80
#note Best bingo is H5 SEq(U)ENCE, but apparently the best play is G7 EWE for 8, leaving CENS?.  Hmmm.   The duck docks me 6 points.
>Lee_Brooks: NOV A7 OV.N +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: BGMNSVY D6 GYV. +15 95
#note D8 B(E)VY wins by 4 points, with this choice second.
>Lee_Brooks: EFO E5 FOE +20 41
>Jim_Burlant: BILMNRS 10G BLIN +16 111
#note 6D GOBLIN wins the sim. I've played Lee before and as you'll see, the board tends to close down rapidly against her.  I was doing this to try and keep the board alive.  
>Lee_Brooks: AETT F4 TEAT +23 64
>Jim_Burlant: EEMORSU 7H MOUE +15 126
#note Or MEOU in the same spot.  
>Lee_Brooks: ADEKR 8K DRAKE +36 100
>Jim_Burlant: EINORSZ N6 ZE. +36 162
#note Great rack except for the Z.  M7 Z(A) 21 wins the sim.  While EINORS is a potent bingo stem, it's not as sure-fire as, say, SATINE, so I passed on the fish and opted to score.  The sim says this choice is roughly a 0.5-point dog to ZA M7.
>Lee_Brooks: ALW O5 WAL. +20 120
>Jim_Burlant: IIMNORS M8 .MORINI +24 186
#note Didn't see MIRZA 6k. This choice finishes in the middle of the pack.  Quackle doesn't like it, as it breaks up too much of the rack. Lee held this...but let it go.  Her next move made it clear why she let it go.
>Lee_Brooks: ?AINORS B1 RAtIONS +68 188
#note Even with the 2-point lead, Lee's winning chances are only 37%.
>Jim_Burlant: ADFHNST 1A D.AFT +39 225
#note What is it with these low-prob draws?  It didn't occur to me there was an 18000-probability bingo that I could have played.  This is the best non-bingo option, simming at 70%.  The bingo, 2A HANDFAST, sims at 82%.
>Lee_Brooks: ADEIITT -ADEI +0 188
>Jim_Burlant: AEHINSY F1 YA +20 245
#note A little too paranoid about IER extensions on row 1.  I also felt that I should try to force her to find an 8.  L10 YAH and L10 YEH win the sim.  
>Lee_Brooks: CDOR K3 CORD.. +20 208
>Jim_Burlant: AEHINSS N10 HES +31 276
#note L11 AHI wins the sim; I would rather balance the rack and unload one of my 2 S's.  Quackle doesn't like this play much, presumably because I toss the E and one of my S's.  
>Lee_Brooks: JLT 4A J.LT +38 246
>Jim_Burlant: AIINPST L12 PI +20 296
#note After spending several minutes finding the 8 that wasn't there I looked for L-column plays.  I didn't see the dangerous opening I'd created for an H until right after I hit my clock - whoops.  This play gets slammed in the sim.  Something in the L-column was obviously the right choice, but my play wasn't.  L10 PITA wins - I didn't see it.
>Lee_Brooks: ABOR 3K .ARBO +18 264
>Jim_Burlant: AGHINST O12 HANG +49 345
#note Bailed out of the previous turn's mistake by drawing the H.  THING O11 wins at 98%, with this play second at 97.  The game is pretty much over now except for the final score.
>Lee_Brooks: EQTU 4I QU.TE +34 298
>Jim_Burlant: IIILRST I4 .I +11 356
#note C1 ARIL is Quackle's #1 choice; I prefer this as it unloads an I and forces her to empty the bag.
>Lee_Brooks: EP L8 .EP +17 315
>Jim_Burlant: AIILRST 2L TI +8 364
#note Just going for the easy out in two, which she won't block because she has to unload the x.
>Lee_Brooks: EGIOUX O1 OX. +30 345
>Jim_Burlant: AILRS 1H RAILS +23 387
>Jim_Burlant:  (EGIU) +10 397
