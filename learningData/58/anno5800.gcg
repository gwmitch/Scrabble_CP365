>Steve_Glass: DEEORZ 9I ZEROED +50 67
#note ...  (Damn, he blocked MATE(R)NAL.)
>Ryan_Fischer: AAELMNT 6J METAL +27 55
#note I couldn't bring myself to leave two As, but sometimes I forget how good As are.  10I EM 34 is the play; I shouldn't have left that spot for so long.  METAL doesn't even rank.

#note K11 AUREI is kinda nuts.

#note Still shoulda taken the spot.  Oh well.  He held me on this for a bit.
>Steve_Glass: ADEGHNO 10E HANGED +38 169
#note O10 HAGDON 51 -- he said he was considering HONED before HANGED.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEHIN 11D HAE +24 135
#note 5J AHI 31.  I get better -- promise!  This is second, and seemed to make more sense at the time.

>Steve_Glass: EFINO 2B FIE +16 384
#note No sense in blocking my out 'cause I have two, at least.  He was low on time though.  This almost cost him.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IRRY O2 YIRRs +15 362
#note I saw 1D fIRRY but wasn't sure.  Pretty cool play.  Would have tried it if it'd've won.  Though since it was the end of the tourney I probably should have played it anyway.  Didn't see YIRR(E)d down low until just now, but I was low on time too.  Like I said, that was a warmup.  It gets better. :)
