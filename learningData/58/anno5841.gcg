#note My exchange is way down as usual.  Oh well.  Q suggests just dumping the J for J(AW), which is really not too bright.
>Steve_Glass: BNO G6 BO.N +20 41
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEIIR 5E DIARIEs +85 101
#note Missed C6 AIR(F)IElD 74.  I got ABORN*/ABOON/ABORNING confused (well, not really -- I sorta knew it was bogus, but didn't like where the bingos I saw would land (DIARIES/DAIRIES/DIATRIBE).  He didn't blink at it either, had the same ABORN*/ABOON indecision I did.
>Steve_Glass: BEIT H1 BITE. +24 65
>Ryan_Fischer: INNOPRU J3 PR.UNION +64 165
#note Pretty nice little happy accident here.  If I play DIARIES/DAIRIES this doesn't go down.  Of course, observing the phenomenon changes it.
>Steve_Glass: ERSTVY -  +0 65
#note Count it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEHIOS 8A HAO +23 188
>Steve_Glass: ERSTVY 11H VESTRY +35 100
#note Q likes 8J (I)VY 13.  Yeah, maybe.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEISST L6 SISTE.ED +70 258
#note Crazy.  The one anagram I forgot is L7 EDIT(R)ESS 72.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAEMRT A8 .ATMAkER +89 381
#note It was crazy how fast I saw this, and played it.  I apologized (somewhat) profusely, trying to contain my laughter.  Step aside AEGHLOPY, we have a new favorite play!  (And of course, I probably wouldn't have seen any of the other 13+ bingos that played -- well, maybe a few.)
>Steve_Glass: HIV -  +0 164
#note And one!
>Ryan_Fischer: CCENNWX -WCCNN +0 381
#note Should've seen C(LO)WN, did see ANNEX, wanted to roll the dice.  On what, I don't know.  Not too bright.
>Steve_Glass: HIV 8L .HIV +30 194
>Ryan_Fischer: AEESUXZ 4D ZAX +50 431
#note Ooh, fancy.  D9 (R)ESEAUX 44.  I guess it sets up a redraw for ADZ C11, but I really don't see the point.
>Steve_Glass: ADEG B11 EGAD +26 220
#note Nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIISU 9L .I +9 440
#note Decided to fish for (B)EAUTIES, 'cause there weren't a lot of other options.  I think I mistracked 'cause at this point I saw two Ts out there, but there was only one.  Steve, upon seeing me fish, said "oh, you'll get it" and laughed.  I'm almost surprised I didn't get it.
>Steve_Glass: GOY C11 GOY +34 254
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINSU D11 AN +21 461
#note This 21-point play doesn't even appear on Q's initial list.  Silly.
>Steve_Glass: CGLN N6 CL.NG +21 275
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEEISU 13J CE.E +14 475
#note Looks like I neglected to write down part of this rack.  The only reason I'd play 2 Es is if I had three, so I think this is right.
>Steve_Glass: FOW 14F WO.F +18 293
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILMSU 6A EMEUS +17 492
#note M1 MUESLI 21.  Cool!  Of course, it gives up POINTE O1 33 if I've tracked right.  Which, oddly, this is one time this tourney I didn't.  My totally bagging my opp made me lazy and after HATMAKER I was pretty much coasting.  This is how I repay someone who stomped Cree the previous round to keep me within striking distance?  :)  4J (R)ELUME is what Champ suggests.  My play gives him POINT(E), which he doesn't see.
>Steve_Glass: EINOPT N2 PINO..... +28 321
#note I don't even think to hold this 'cause it's so creative.  If I was closer to Cree in spread, I probably should have.
>Ryan_Fischer: IL O1 LI +10 502
#note ...and I miss LI(QUID) to go out.  Oh well.  Definitely my favorite game of the tourney, though I got sloppy.  Usually total baggings aren't that great, but he took it well.
