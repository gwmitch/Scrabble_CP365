>Matthew_Bernardina: ABKLU 8D BAULK +28 28
#note I personally don't think a point sacrifice is worth the defensive concerns here.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEFGNOU D8 .EFOG +22 22
>Matthew_Bernardina: JW 9C J.W +26 54
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEINOU 12A BOU.IE +12 34
#note It was between this and (F)EU and I went for turnover.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EFIRS A10 FI.ERS +33 87
#note Q also likes E11 F(I)E.
>Ryan_Fischer: ??DEHNN 15A .HiNNiED +83 117
#note Well, it worked.  I really dislike having both blanks on my rack, but at least I was able to find a high play.  At least I didn't do something stupid like N(O)H.
>Matthew_Bernardina: IV F10 VI. +14 101
>Ryan_Fischer: AAOPRST G1 PASTORA. +62 179
#note Say it with me: rack management.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EGOR 1D GRO.E +30 131
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEOOWY I5 AWAY +26 205
>Matthew_Bernardina: EEZ D1 .EEZ +28 159
>Ryan_Fischer: ENOOUVY 6F V.O. +18 223
#note Some very interesting plays missed: 6B VOYEU(R), 4D (Z)OO(T)Y, C2 OY.
>Matthew_Bernardina: MU 14A .UM +23 182
>Ryan_Fischer: ENOTTUY 2F N.TTY +24 247
#note YUT(Z)... kinda iffy.  Not too smart to spend all my consonants, I know.
>Matthew_Bernardina: CIINORS 14H INCISOR +83 265
#note And now I really wish I didn't spend my Y, either.  Of note: (PASTORAL)I G1 12 -- haha.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEGNOU 5I .DUNC +16 263
#note Missed CONG(O)U, but it's probably best that I don't do that yet anyway.  DUG 13F is Q's choice.  I like it.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ADL E3 DAL +22 287
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGOPQT 13K QAT +41 304
>Matthew_Bernardina: MT 11D .M.T +20 307
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIOOP 15M PEG +25 329
#note It's getting critical that I take the hook out, so while the leave is atrocious, I gotta do it.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DEL 13F DEL +17 324
#note And he tells me he had a bingo there, but I forget what.  Of note again: G1(PASTORAL)E 12.  Wow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIOOX 4J AXE +36 365
#note That X was a small miracle.  He saved me the trouble of worring about whether I should play it at 14E.  Better to take out some lines.  Wonder if OXO is better -- I have the last Os.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EHINRRS 3C R.. +8 332
#note I think he said this was his rack here.  Good play to give him some hope.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIILOO B2 AIOLI +19 384
#note I'm in a spot of trouble here, 'cause from my perspective he could have HINTERS or (V)ITRINES, and maybe some other stuff.  So my only option is to pick a spot to block and pray that a killer letter isn't in the bag.  And AIOLI is indeed the champ's choice, with there being a 1/8 chance of me losing.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EHINRST A6 HER +23 355
#note He did indeed have HINTERS.  A1 ETHS is what he couldn't see in the little time he had left.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIO 10F .IE +8 392
#note (J)O is best.  I was rushing to try to push him over, I think.
>Matthew_Bernardina: INST 3L TINS +11 366
>Matthew_Bernardina:  (O) +2 368
