#note 8H placment sims roughly 1 point better.

#note F6 SIALS and F6 LIARS are the sim winners.  Ths play comes in 5th, at a moderate equity loss.  I like the fact that this ditches the L and the only thing that it really opens up is a bingo line through the L.  It was certainly enough to throw me for a loop. :-p

>Jim_Burlant: EIOPRSS B10 PO.ES +26 62
#note Urp.  Didn't know the 7's, and the only 8's I saw needed a T that wasn't there (REPOSITS, PROSTIES, etc.).  I didn't realize what I'd missed through the L until after I'd hit my clock.   Bleah.  Best bingo is H8 DISPOSER.

>Jim_Burlant: IMORRSZ C11 R.M +28 90
#note Best.   70% winning chances now.

#note Best, but then again it's not like these last 2 plays were particularly difficult to find.  Because I was castigating myself for whiffing on SPOILERS a couple of turns back, I actually spent a while on this turn, making sure there wasn't another bingo in this rack.   The only thing I could think of was SOLARIZE...and it turns out that's the only 8 in this rack.

#note Only playable bingo; no 8's available.
>Debbie_Scholz: JR 4H J.R +18 107
>Jim_Burlant: AINNOTX F10 XI +54 251
#note Obviously best despite leaving myself duplicated N's.  Sim says I'm now at 97% winning chances, even with both blanks unseen.
>Debbie_Scholz: AI 6I .IA +8 115
>Jim_Burlant: AFNNNOT K5 F.NON +16 267
#note Quackle prefers 5k FONT 24; given the size of my lead I felt I could take a turn out to balance the rack a bit better.  This play gives up not quite 4 points to FONT despite the 8-point deficit on the scoreboard.  
>Debbie_Scholz: ??FIRTT L8 FaTTIeR +84 199
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHLNT G3 HA +20 287
#note Didn't know there was an 8 in this rack, ANTHERAL.  This sims as highest-valuation non-bingo option.  The bingo sims at 99% winning chances,this play holds steady at 95.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: ALMOORT 15N MO +16 327
#note Bit of a miss here.  13I MOTEL and 13I MOREL win the sim.  When I saw this play wasn't among Quackle's original choices, I figured I'd made a horrendous play.  Turns out this play sims 5th best, albeit at a moderate loss of equity (7 points) despite scoring 19 points fewer than MOTEL.  Guessing that's because she now can't burn me with an S-back-hook to KYRIE and that ALORT is a marginally better leave than AOR. 
>Debbie_Scholz: TW 15H TW.. +21 277
>Jim_Burlant: ALOQRST 2F QAT +38 365
#note Wasn't thrilled about having to open up row 1, but there were too many points available to pass this play up.  Quackle agrees - this play wins the sim.
>Debbie_Scholz: CEI 1H ICE +21 298
#note Incorrectly scored as 17.   Guess I wasn't paying attention.
>Jim_Burlant: AGLNORS L3 GOAL +22 387
#note Surprisingly, sim winner, beating out 13G GALORES 37 (which I didn't see) by 5 points.
>Debbie_Scholz: OY M3 OY +21 319
#note Incorrectly scored as 24.  So at this point our scoresheets show the score as 387 - 318.
>Jim_Burlant: DNORSUV O4 VODU. +13 400
#note Best.
>Debbie_Scholz: AL D8 .AL +16 335
>Jim_Burlant: CINORRS G11 CORN +14 414
#note Suboptimal end game play, I opted for the easy out in two.   Best plays are 13H CRORE 20 and 13H CRORES 33.
