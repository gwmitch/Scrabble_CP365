>Jason: IIOOTUU -IOOUU +0 48
#note Probably should've just thrown it all back. The decision did not look smart when I pulled ITT on the exchange.
>Jason_J._Smith: AEU F8 .EAU +14 33
>Jason: AGIITTT E3 TATTI.. +14 62
#note Forgot the T hook to BEAU, which I remembered a couple turns later. TITI there is about three better, says Speedy.
>Jason_J._Smith: ELOOSTV 4C OV.L +14 47
#note Fortunate that Jason (a Volost natural, obviously) chickened out on the 94-point double-double, a word I knew (an opponent at Nats also chickened out on it against me and we both learned it in the post-mortem).
>Jason: AGIIIOV -AGIIIOV +0 62
#note I(L)IA just didn't seem worth it. Speedy dislikes the exchange, but I think it's right.
>Jason_J._Smith: BKR C3 B.RK +20 67
>Jason: AEGHIRS I2 HEGIRAS +80 142
#note Nice exchange!

>Jason: FNOOQRW 5K WON +25 200
#note (I)NFO is a better way to play defense. But I don't mind setting my opponent up for column N bingos.
>Jason_J._Smith: AEGIRST H8 .IGARETS +86 202
>Jason: DEFOQRT -FQ +0 200
#note Tough call. Speedy puts FORTE at N2 (also CP's pick) three-plus clear of the field (and 7.5 ahead of this), but that gives a lot back. Nothing looks good. I felt like forcing Jason's hand a bit, making him block at the bottom (and it would be hard to block everything eight-wise). Plus, a decent chance at sevens, given the plethora of A's and I's and N's out. CP says exchanging into DERT is second, this third.
>Jason_J._Smith: AGNU 14D GAUN. +8 210

#note Glad to get another bite at the BEAUT-iful apple.

>Jason: EIINQUZ 1N IN +8 318
#note Really counterintuitive, but if he plays an O2 bingo, there's a chance I have no good counterplays even with the QU, QI and Z. This way, column N bingos allow row 8 plays, and 15H bingos allow potential for a QI-ish play at 14J or maybe a big N10 play. Just didn't like ZE(D) ... his bingo next turn makes it an even game, and a random rack from this pool is better than IINQU+2.

#note Always nice when a plan comes together.
>Jason_J._Smith: ?DEILNR 5B E. +2 358
#note Despite the obvious dreckiness of my rack, looks like it's hopeless for him. CP says (E)L at 11J wins 1/8, but I went through the D, E, and P in the bag scenarios, and I have wins with all of them, so not sure what that's about.
>Jason: DEEIIII B13 .EE +20 441
#note Not my best play (nine behind DIET at O12), but my thought was this: This is my highest-scoring play (although DIET and DEEt at O12 also net eight points should he out-bingo, and it blocks) and Jason was down to 1:15. I didn't see anything, did the math and knew his bingo needed to be 71 to tie, 81 if he went over <1 min. So, I played this fast and put the onus on him to find (what turns out to be) a non-existent out-bingo.
>Jason_J._Smith: ?DILNPR O8 PRINt +32 390
>Jason: DIIII 15A D. +9 450
#note Blocking the 12-point outs here, missing LED at I11 (fortunately, he would too). -3.
>Jason_J._Smith: DL 11J .LD +8 398
#note I don't wear glasses, but he can still call me four-Is. (rimshot)
