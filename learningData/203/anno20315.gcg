>Alec_Sjoholm: ENOPRTU 3G PORTUNE +72 284
#note So, I really didn't think this was good...I started thinking about IMPORTUNE and OPPORTUNE and starting having doubts. Also, I'd never scored over 600 in a tournament game and thought that if for some reason PORTUNE happened to be good I'd fall short of that mark. Should've just trusted my instincts and insta-challenged.

#note Not much to talk about here except for accepting a phony and missing RaGLANS. 

And we have the score agreed upon as 601-331! So technically I've still never scored 600+ in a tournament game.
