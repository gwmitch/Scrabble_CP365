>michal_josko: ACENOSU -COU +0 0
#note fishing for easy bingo
>norman: DEHIIOT 8F THIO +14 14
#note i would think about HOI, HIOI, DITH
quackle- HOI, HIOI best 
thio 6th choice - not bad
>michal_josko: AAENOOS 9G ANOA +17 17
#note thought of aeon and eoan#( quackles 1st and 2nd choice), but decided that keeping oes is better than keeping aos. little bit gambled, big moves like ZOO or AX may hurt me
>norman: DEEILNR 10A RELINED +69 83

#note didnt know ENGOBES# and ENGLOBES#

>michal_josko: EGNORST D7 GEN.TORS +70 105
#note considered TONGERS but wasnt sure of it. only point better than GENITORS. 3rd possibility - ROSETING#
>norman: DEEFGIO C12 GEO +17 136
#note FIREDOG would be nice rack clean.

>norman: DEEILRT 11I DEET +28 189
#note TILLERED, FILTERED, TREDILLE#
>michal_josko: AEIMRTV 4B V.M +16 192
#note QUACKLE prefer MAVIE 12K, VIM rated as 14 move. i still like it, cos keeping AEIRT, with 3 unseen s and 2 blanks, its lovely leave. i also considered MIRV# , but that could be bad mistake, and QUACKLE doesnt like it either
>norman: ACDILRU 5C .UD +14 203
#note 4th choice, DRAIL DRAC# both on 12j and LUCID 12F rated slightly higher
>michal_josko: AEIRSTY 12B Y.. +7 199
#note so close to BESTIARY. ( didnt know SYBARITE).
>norman: ACILRST O6 CARTS +33 236
#note CITRALS in 2 spots. no worries, i would also miss it.
>michal_josko: AEIRSTW M3 STRAWIE. +82 281
#note best. although aeirstw has 4 bingos, only one fit on this board in 2 spots that is 2nd and 3rd choice.
>norman: AILMOTU L2 MOA +16 252
>michal_josko: EINRSVX K4 VIXEN +36 317
>norman: ILLPTUZ 12H PI +10 262
#note no.1 is FUZIL. i also like FUTZ and FULL. few other interesting csw words : POSTIL, TITUP ( this one i knew), TITULI.

PI is very weak.
 
>michal_josko: EINPQRS 13G QIN +32 349
#note best
>norman: ?LLNTUZ 14F ZiT +46 308
#note hard to say what to do. quackle suggests ZOS again, which gives you few opportunities for bingo in next turn, however they are not baby bingos - 5 possble sevens with probably between 20 k and 31k if you decide to play ZOS. ZIN and ZIT most points . however,all letters that left, its impossible for me not to block it.
>michal_josko: AAEGPRS 15H AGAPE +45 394
#note or APAGE# - both no.1 .  choice 3 APGAR# - smth new for me. most points for SARAPE - another newie for me.
>norman: KLLNUUU 3C .UNK +16 324
#note bad luck for you now . LUNK is the only word with possible valuation
>michal_josko: ?EFIORS 14J FORES +51 445
#note best plus 7 others on same spot
>norman: ELLUU J6 EL +24 348
#note best
