>Gunther_Jacobi: EHIINUZ H7 HI +10 10
#note Very interesting rack I thought. Q says UH then HUE, both I can see being better than my play. UH rids me of the not so desirable U and doesn't give back the plethora of hooks HI does. I guess I was going for what I thought was ultra balance but Q really finds no merit with HI. HUE looks good also but I failed to consider it because I didn't want to part with my E. ZEIN ZINE plays don't seem like options to me at all.
>Geoff_Tongue: ADMORTW 9F MADWORT +75 75
#note This looked so funky to me when he put this down. He spent quite some time making this play but after the game he informed me he was very concerned out placement, not validity. I challenged instantly. Bad decision.

#note OVE(N)wARE 12G or OVEr(F)EAR need to be found for the 6 extra points.

#note SUQ 14J says Quackle... I didn't know COVINGS. My play registers second.

>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEILMR C1 AIM +29 286
#note WOW! Quackle really digs (PE)A M5! AIM is next. Had I seen REMAIL B10 I would've jumped on it.

#note Everything is ugly here...RI(PE) TRI(PE) then miles upon miles of exchanges. I thought I was blocking the most accessible line but no.  U(L)U was what I first wanted to play. I spent a lot of time on this rack and didn't go with my instinct here...
