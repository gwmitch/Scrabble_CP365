>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGIINS H8 SAIlING +66 66
#note Here it comes... I wonder, between P/F(AIRINGS), B/P(RAISING) and (SAILING)S, which one is most likely to win me the game. 
>Richard_Popper: GNU G7 GUN +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: BIJRTWX 13F JI.X +27 93
#note Even with this hilarious rack of mine. It was close in my head between this and JI(G). I decided that the X wasn't worth keeping and that my slotting should not be messed with!
>Richard_Popper: Q 12G Q. +22 34
>Joshua_Sokol: BENRTUW I6 BREW +27 120
#note I saw WEB and NEWT as well, at I7. Why give Richard lanes? That is the last thing I will do in this position.
>Richard_Popper: III -III +0 34
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DHNRTU 8E UN...D +7 127
#note For the sake of this board I am now in insanely good control of, there is really no need to jump the gun and play HURDs for 57! It seemed like a great idea to switch gears here and open a nice 2x2 that I am a huge favorite to hit if things go awry. Even though the chances of things going awry are very very low at this point :)
>Richard_Popper: AE J5 AE +10 44
#note that felt really good
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EHIRTV 15B THRIVEs +110 237
#note "I can't believe you made that play".
>Richard_Popper: AEINNRS 4H INSANER +69 113
#note Aha, so I was wrong. Richard drew into a lucky ANE(U)RINS! K1 is also the INSANER option.
>Joshua_Sokol: AHKNORY 3K KAYO +42 279
#note So despite KAYO being a great play and all, on second thought, I kind of like 5J (A)YAH. It scores 5 less but really does much better at sealing that part of the board up. It also keeps a vowel for "safety net" purposes. Yes, you heard it here! I'm a pinko socialist when it comes to Scrabble...
>Richard_Popper: EY 5J .YE +35 148
#note Too easy!
>Joshua_Sokol: ABHMNOR 2J ROMAN +47 326
#note well, that happened. I didn't know the other candidate option here, RHOMB at 2I. I wonder if Richard would have challenged that, too.
>Richard_Popper: ADRSTTU -  +0 148
>Joshua_Sokol: BDHIPTT H1 BID. +21 347
#note I didn't see what else to do here. This is just as good as anything. 5E DIPT is also good.
>Richard_Popper: CEEOO 3C COOEE. +20 168
#note scored as 18.
>Joshua_Sokol: FHPPTTU 4D PHT +31 378
#note underscored by 2
>Richard_Popper: DIU 14H .UID +17 185
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFOPTU 2D FOP +39 417
#note OUT(JINX) is a word! I forgot :)
>Richard_Popper: AFLOO 13K ALOOF +19 204
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEITUZ O13 .EZ +45 462
#note Apparently FIZ is better. Maybe I should go with FEU.
>Richard_Popper: CI C13 IC. +16 220
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEILTU L8 LUTEA. +14 476
#note I decided to let Richard bingo cause I felt bad for him.
