>Matt_Canik: AACPRSS 8A CRAPS +41 41
#note CRAPS and SPA or SPAR are the big plays here. I like putting the C at A8 to open some extra volatility in a game where I'm already down. 
SCARPAS# is a word I didn't know, FU collins.

>Matt_Canik: AABFRSS 5K BARF +26 116
#note So many close options here. F(L)ABS, FAB, BARF, BARFS, etc in a bunch of different spots. I decided to go for the S setup here, though I like what FLABS does for the board long-term too.

#note ?ABFINOORRTU is actually unseen now that I know his rack. (G)UM setting up GUMP# would be cool if I knew it. Playing off a ton of tiles to get that blank, though...
>xp: EEGNORT 14B RONG +17 346
#note Apparently COREGENT# and CONGREET# are collins words. This is what happens when the two guys who know no collins play collins!!!

#note XP apparently has one win here, per Quackle. But it's SIIIICK. He is really screwed, though, because I have BURRITO on my rack.
