>Joshua_Sokol: AAHNORR H7 HORA +14 14
#note I haven't played Larry often enough to figure out what the best strategy is against him, so I wasn't sure if I should play RAH or HORA. I decided to just go for an open board here. I had forgotten that HORA took the L, hence my placement, so it looks like it's a wee bit better with the A on the star. 
>Larry_Sherman: EHLOT 11D HOTEL +24 24
#note missing/not knowing HORAH.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINNRT I2 ENTRAIN +67 81
#note There is much to be said about playing F4 INTRANE(T) here. Larry's options are so much fewer after that play that he almost has to play on row 12. That wouldn't really be good for me. Although I do know Larry probably isn't as good as it gets in terms of keeping balanced leaves.

#note so far so good
>Larry_Sherman: EMMS 13B MEMS +39 157
#note Although this was a difficult move. I can't score well or keep a decent rack leave. It looked like I had to choose one of many placements of GUAVA. Ultimately I decided that he was pretty unlikely to have the X, and even then would need an I to take advantage of the F6 spot. And most of the time he does hold XI he doesn't hold that well after the play anyway. C1 VAGR(A)NT looks like the right play upon further analysis. I did not see it.
>Joshua_Sokol: AGNRTUV C3 GU.VA +20 190
#note This turn was very difficult for me. At first I really saw nothing that made any sense to play, and then I saw the 3 spots for GUAVA. C3 scored the most, but opened the easiest scoring comebacks, given the prevalence and likelihood of the S. Any play there would leave the game tied with an NRT leave that isn't going anywhere for me. C1 GUAV(A) gave back a good scoring spot, but one that seems a tad more difficult to take advantage of, although that may not be true. And F3 GU(A)VA scores the least, but gives back the least attainable scoring spot, although the most dangerous one. A play like QUILLS or COZENS or even DITZES forming GUAVAS is a possibility later on that isn't great to leave open against someone I feel I can outplay. If only I had seen C1 VAGR(A)NT, I wouldn't have had to struggle this turn. Even though there is a ton of bad stuff to come, I can deal with that given my lead. It seems like Larry isn't really keeping an X all too often, nor is he keeping very well, but it could be the other way around. I think he does like to grab points. I really don't know if I made the right play here, despite mine being correct against almost every player every time.
>Larry_Sherman: IX 6F XI +52 209
>Joshua_Sokol: ENORTVZ K2 ROVEN +22 212
#note I was obviously quite unhappy about Larry having XI there. That was the turning point of the game, since I missed much better plays here. That is what you call being on tilt. 2G O(YE)Z is slick, G8 ZON(E) or ZON(E)R are plays I would obviously see otherwise, and everything else was just an oversight. I saw this, it looked like all I could do and I played it. 
>Larry_Sherman: ?EGNOSU L6 SUrGEON +71 280
#note And I gave him a bingo. ZONE or ZONER would have played GEN(E)rOUS, but I doubt Larry would have seen that.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEJLTZ K11 JET +40 252
>Larry_Sherman: EFW 14J FEW +28 308
#note 10B FEW is one more and doesn't open a dangerous spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEILOZ 15E ZOECIA +56 308
#note I was set to play ZOECIAL even though I was pretty confident it was bad, but now I'm back in the game.
>Larry_Sherman: GIIL 4K .IGIL +20 328
#note Or am I?
>Joshua_Sokol: DELLOST O1 LOL.ED +21 329
#note VIGIL really annoyed me during the game. If he does have the blank, he's letting me get back in the game when he doesn't need to. If he doesn't have the blank, he's taking a huge risk by opening a closed board. That was along the lines of my thought process when he played VIGIL. It may or may not be an accurate criticism of his play. I was also annoyed I didn't have a good snapback play. This was as good as it got, hope to avoid the Q without an I and hope to draw the blank. Otherwise I might be in a lot of trouble. Keeping the L and playing TOLLED might be better, but I don't think so. 
>Larry_Sherman: IP 1K PI +16 344
>Joshua_Sokol: ANPQRST 8A RASP +37 366
#note Now I'm pretty convinced Larry has the blank, but maybe he was just I-heavy. I also drew the Q without an I, so that's a big issue. I can't dump it for 11 here, because 1) I won't draw into a thing and 2) I will almost certainly get outrun.

I can also play 14A APT here and hope for a U or an I. Larry seems to have one of the remaining I's, so I only have 2 shots at one of the two, and even then, it looks grim. QIS is a lot, but it may not be enough. The QU combo is also not really helpful here.

So I basically need to hope for a specific tile that might not even be in the bag. It looks like this is my only chance. Hope he can't hit anything for another turn at N6 and makes a failed attempt at fishing, allowing me to play my Q and just barely outrun him. Or maybe I draw the blank and win. That would be great.
>Larry_Sherman: ?ADEIST N6 ArIDEST +66 410
#note No dice. Larry hits his 3rd high probability bingo of the game and I am done for. If only the Q could have been in the bag. Also, Larry missed a sick one here, 10A DIASTEm(A) 10A. Passing is also a good option here!
>Joshua_Sokol: CDINOQT O12 ODIC +27 393
#note It'd be cool if he would miss his outs. Also this plays 15L for 3 more. A rare simple board vision mistake by me...
>Larry_Sherman: KU B8 .UK +17 427
>Larry_Sherman:  (QNT) +24 451
#note I could have won this game despite it all!
