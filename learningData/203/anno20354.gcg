#note This honestly makes very little sense. Trading 4 to open indicates 3 tiles worth keeping, and BIJ are none of those tiles.  Very few tiles have lost that much tile (certainly keeping E and S are worthwhile here).  I guess something like ORT is possible though...

#note This is very unlikely to be correct.  It's hard to know for sure, but it's just difficult to see this as a feasible play.  With another A ANOA is clearly far better.  With an I, NAOI is clearly the play.  With a U, EAU m3 is clear.  With 3 Es, probably CEE or exchange, and with EOO, you really need to chuck this rack.  Lower value consonants make no sense either. The N is valuable, and it's really hard to imagine what Robin has.  It's most likely that Player 2 just auto-blocked the S and just doesn't know how or why to block the top right instead, and that this S spot isn't really a threat at all at this score.  Instead they are putting herself in a position to get punished farely hard since those bingos score well, don't offer huge comebacks, and open the previously shut down top left, as well as bingos to the A/E in AEONS.  This play also limits scoring, again for little reason.  Even OE m4 makes more sense.

#note This play looks pointless, and I'm quickly losing sight of what she could have.  Combined with her next play I'm completely confused: it's like she doesn't realize that it's important to block the board or how to block the board.  Leaving the top right this open is just asking for trouble.  Player 2 probably has very limited understanding of long term entropy, and possibly just defense in general, based off the last two plays.

#note Very weird.  It can't possibly be right, and is part of the problem of leaving this area of the board open.  Something like ROTI or IOTA has to be better.  This is a pretty clear indication Player 2 has no idea of how boards open or close.
>Opponent: ?IOQUVX -V +0 300
>Player_2: AEGIOPR 3C PROGE.IA +76 443
#note Even though this is clearly right, what makes sense on the last rack?  Pretty much nothing.  This indicates that both defense and long term entropy might be a problem for Player 2.  Let's see if this is supported by more evidence.
