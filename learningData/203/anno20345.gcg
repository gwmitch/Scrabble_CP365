#note Horrible draw to have after what he just played. Do I play something like (E)AU to block? My chances to win are pretty low no matter what. I think I need to get lucky and hope he doesn't have a good play down there. Quackle is suggesting (R)UE, which tells you how crappy the U is.

#note He's probably going to block the letters in SHINGLE so might as well create an S-hook and hope to get lucky.

#note Overall I think I played decent, but a few ugly racks hurt my score. JAWS was a pretty bad miss too.
