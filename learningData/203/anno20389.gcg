#note I don't remember if I saw ZOA(R)IA or 4C ZAMIA here. I was focused on waiting patiently with my Z. This time it's probably worth it to play my Z.

>Joshua_Sokol: AFOORRZ 5B ROOF +27 57
#note I think I missed M1 ZARF. That's a decent play. Was thinking maybe Ricky wasn't going to see PROOF cause he was looking kind of tilted at his draws thus far.

#note was it worth it? meh
>Ricky_Sirois: IIII -IIII +0 63
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AABEQR 7K Q. +11 110
#note Although I liked scoring here, I can score next turn, and even draw into a bingo most of the time. This also has some defensive merits. Sort of.
>Ricky_Sirois: CELV 8F CL.VE +10 73
#note Ricky's body language confirmed the thought I had that he was struggling
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AABERT F6 BA.TERiA +69 179
#note Surely it is much better to play B2 ABE(R)RAnT here. I just couldn't see anything through that R and allotted not to waste time. BARRATER and ARBORETA are the other words that play through the R. ABERRANT is clearly superior to those, since it gives Ricky much less to work with in terms of scoring. Also, I was fairly certain of the hooks to BACTERIA.
>Ricky_Sirois: AFV 13C FAV. +20 93
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHIIIO D10 OHI. +14 193
#note Deciding to play massive defense. It's quite dificult for him to have a bingo now.
>Ricky_Sirois: ?ADEIPS A2 DIAPErS +90 183
#note Big mistake by Ricky here, missing 11C t(H)E(R)APSID, which surely would have garnered a very lengthy hold and most likely even a challenge by his competitor. 
After the game he said he kept fishing with the P in hand to no avail, hence his frustration.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIILTY 2L ..Y +26 219
#note I didn't want to lose ground here. I was frustrated that I sacrificed a lot of rack potential for worthless defense last turn. Perhaps I should have played 11A EIT(H)E(R). I didn't see it. But this is fine as well, using up a prime scoring spot.
>Ricky_Sirois: ENTY C8 TYNE +18 201
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIILTU 11F .UTILE +12 231
#note I saw 14F LIEU. It looked way too risky with many scoring tiles unseen. (D)ILUTE also seemed unnecessary. I2 UTE(R)I also sets up a nice X spot. I think I'll go with this.
>Ricky_Sirois: ADGINRT 12I DARTING +79 280
#note well then
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIJOT 3C JADE +37 268
#note all is not lost just yet, but I went from the driver's seat to the trunk very fast... I'm no longer anything close to a favorite to win this game.
>Ricky_Sirois: EEK O12 .EEK +27 307
>Joshua_Sokol: AINNOST 14F NATIONS +75 343
#note I was all set to play NATIONS and BACTERIAN here. I then questioned the validity of BACTERIAN, and was about 95% sure. So given that it loked like more than a 5% increase in winning percentage over SONATIN(E) at 14H, I allotted to play this. Ricky held, and then let it go, miraculously. BACTERIA takes an L and an S. I thought it took an L and an N. This could and should have been a very costly mistake. Who knows if I would have seen SANTONI(N) N5 if Ricky saw SONATINE and blocked.
>Ricky_Sirois: BI 15G BI +22 329
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNSUWX M7 SEX +32 375
#note This is a complex endgame, so I'm not sure I can trust the figures I am looking at right now. So I'll just do it manually. M7 SLEW wins every time, as does M7 SEWN. Those look like the two best plays. I did some calculations in game, and I was running low on time, so I played this cause I was fairly confident it won every endgame. I knew there were problematic setups Ricky could make but I outran them all.
>Ricky_Sirois: EEGMNTU N8 MUG +23 352
#note And I drew the S of all tiles. This is 3 points behind N8 NUME(N).
>Joshua_Sokol: LNSUW O6 NUS +24 399
>Ricky_Sirois: EENT 13M TE. +12 364
#note best is VE(T).
