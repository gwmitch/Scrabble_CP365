>Matthew_Larocque: AHIPSTV 8G PITH +18 18
#note Strange turn. I rarely burn my S on the first turn unless I score more than 30, but PAVIS seems like a strong choice. I forgot about PHT, and overlooked just playing TAV.
>Maureen_Morris: EQTUU 7F TUQUE +40 40
#note Well then.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEPSUV 6J PAVED +35 53
>Maureen_Morris: CEOY L4 CO.EY +34 74
>Matthew_Larocque: AAERSUW 5N AW +8 61
#note I was so obssessed with not giving away cheap points like with M8 AWA, I ought to just score 30 for (Y)AWS which I don't think I even considered. Much time wasted here.
>Maureen_Morris: ?FGILSS 9B FIGLeSS +80 154
>Maureen_Morris: ?FGILSS --  -80 74
#note I wouldn't have even been surprised if this ended up being valid.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIRSU 6D EAU +9 70
#note I'm actually giving her a bingo here when she didn't have one before! Perhaps AUREI/URAEI are better, Q also likes exchange keeping AERS.
>Maureen_Morris: ?FGILSS D3 FLI.S +16 90
#note She had GIFTLESS.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIIMORS C2 OI +14 84
#note MIAO(W), too focused on what the best fishing play was. So, I set up my R and hoped she didn't draw anything that could play here. I can't explain how I forgot she still had row 9 to bingo on.
>Maureen_Morris: ?BGSS 5C G.B +20 110
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIJMRS 9C JAMBS +31 115
#note I get over my duh moment and decided to take points and kill the easiest place to bingo. This still isn't good for me because she's still going to be ahead with S? on her rack. Less than 30% chance says Quackle, with J(O) ranking slightly higher.
>Maureen_Morris: ?EOSV 10B VOE +25 135
>Matthew_Larocque: DFINRRT 7L .F +18 133
#note Playing defense at the expense of my leave, now I'm less than 20% to win.
>Maureen_Morris: ??EGLNS 1C pLuNGES +73 208
#note My own fault that happened, but this would have been a tough game regardless.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINRRT C9 ..INER +26 159
#note No holding back now; I could still get lucky and maybe grab the last S.
>Maureen_Morris: EGN B13 NEG +14 222
>Matthew_Larocque: CDORTTU F9 .RUT +8 167
#note Tough position, but I need to keep it open and hopefully she will slow down her scoring to try and block.
>Maureen_Morris: III -III +0 222
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDILOT 11E O.TLAID +32 199
>Maureen_Morris: ADEZ H11 .AZED +48 270
#note Damn.
>Matthew_Larocque: CIIMOTW 10J MIC +26 225
#note Missed MIOTIC, but this creates another setup for her to worry about.
>Maureen_Morris: AX I13 AX +31 301
>Matthew_Larocque: INOOOTW 2A WO. +12 237
#note I don't actually expect to bingo from the W, but it's a distraction.
>Maureen_Morris: NT 14G N..T +13 314
>Matthew_Larocque: IKNOORT O1 KOTO. +39 276
#note If I knew KROON/I, I can set up my I by playing at M10. Gives me more of a chance than this does.
>Maureen_Morris: INOR 15J IRON +7 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINRY 5K Y. +20 296
#note If I get rid of an I, there's two unseen Es to make DEANERY/IRONY. Of course, I'd have to be confident DEANERY was even a word in order to fish for it. Quackle's sim likes playing N14 AY to empty the bag. Looks like there's a minute chance I draw SL to give me 3x3 SWINDLER, but the LINDERS rack has no sevens in it, so I would have to rely on her making a mistake.

>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINRR A1 .....IER +33 329
>Maureen_Morris: AEEH 15E HEE. +10 358
#note She neglected to draw the last letter (A). I wasn't paying attention. Too bad, lost 17 points of spread. Her score was misrecorded as 368. I spent too much time dinking around and the OI play really backfired on me. Then she drew the Z and the X to nail my coffin shut.
