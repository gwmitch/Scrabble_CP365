#note This game was played with the new TWL words. There's doubtlessly something better here, but I thought this might get a challenge.

#note ORIGANS 2I wins the sim, but I'd rather have the extra bingo lane on Row 3.

#note I had 11 minutes to think about this endgame. From my perspective, the last tile in the bag is very likely to be an N (else AN 2I). I couldn't think of a win with N in the bag (there isn't one). I noticed that with an L in the bag, EQUIPS wins, because he can't block both VEILINGs and YIELdING. I saw that an A won after XI, and also thought that an E might win (It only ties after ANIL 9H), and also thought an L would be enough here too (YEALINGS or LENSINGS), but the L turns out not to be enough. It's so hard thinking each one of these possibilities through to the end!
