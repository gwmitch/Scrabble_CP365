>Gunther_Jacobi: EEFGHIN H7 FEH +18 18
#note Q says FEEING. I thought about HINGE and FEIGN only. This is worth about 1.5 less than FEEING.
>Evan_Kramer: ENOOZ G5 OZONE +30 30
>Gunther_Jacobi: EGIINTW 6E WI. +17 35
#note I saw GWINE, rejected it because I swore I lost a challenge playing it against Mike Baker some weeks ago at club...Very confusing. WIZ is second.
>Evan_Kramer: OPU 5C UPO +20 50
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEGINOT 8A ANTIGE.. +30 65
>Evan_Kramer: DEJLT D7 J.LTED +28 78
>Gunther_Jacobi: EILMNOS 5G .INOMELS +70 135
#note SEMOLIN(A)!
>Evan_Kramer: AEY 6I AYE +33 111
>Gunther_Jacobi: FLMRSTV -FVRM +0 135
#note Yeah, I thought about V(E)ST L4, but thought this rack had some potential with an exchange. Q wants to keep RST but I discounted that on grounds that there are still 5 R's unseen.
>Evan_Kramer: ADEH 4L HAED +34 145
>Gunther_Jacobi: LQRSTTU N2 QU..T +32 167
>Evan_Kramer: DFOR E11 FORD +29 174
>Gunther_Jacobi: EILNRST A7 R.TLINES +59 226
#note Missing TENDRILS, TRINDLES which score 13 more. Big misses, since those plays handily block FORDS FORDO.
>Evan_Kramer: ADIV O6 AVID +26 200
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEIMRT 14E .IAMETER +65 291
#note More misses. I didn't see any of the 7's, not even MEATIER.
>Evan_Kramer: BEIO H11 BIO.E +30 230
>Gunther_Jacobi: AALORRU N9 AURORAL +71 362
#note Luck...
>Evan_Kramer: ?AGRSTV K8 ViRGAT.S +72 302
>Gunther_Jacobi: BIINOSU O1 BIN. +34 396
#note Q really prefers BI(R)O L12 even though it seven points less.
>Evan_Kramer: EX O11 EX +36 338
>Gunther_Jacobi: CCIOPSU 4D UPO +26 422
#note Plays from 15B are preferred by good margin. PICS in particular, saving COU for COUP.
>Evan_Kramer: ?AGKNWY 13G Y.W +19 357
#note Somehow this is recorded as 35, maybe this isn't his actual play. There was again time pressure on my side.
>Gunther_Jacobi: CCIS M7 SIC +18 440
>Evan_Kramer: ?AGKN C11 KAGu +30 387
#note Best...
>Gunther_Jacobi: C 12M C.. +12 452
#note I made a good deal of mistakes this game, yet because of good tile picking the errors were never critical. The GWINE confusion, missing SEMOLIN(A), airballing EMIRATE EMERITA MEATIER as well as TRIN(D)LES TEN(D)RILS shows I have a lot to work on.

Final recorded as 452-403...there was some mistake involving the score of YOW.
