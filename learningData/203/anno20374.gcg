>Morris_Greenberg: ACELOOT G6 CO.O +10 10
#note Damn, I thought I was completely making up COLO(C)ATE, but it is totally a word.
>Linda_Oliva: LX 7F L.X +19 31
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEKLST 10F KA +25 35
#note I kept the extra E to not create an easy bingo line for Linda. Since I have the S for both S(KA) and (COCOA)S, that becomes much more valuable of a tile. Quackle slightly prefers KAE though.
>Linda_Oliva: IQ 11E QI +28 59
>Morris_Greenberg: EEEGLST H10 EEL +11 46
#note Maybe TEG instead, the difference is negligible.
>Linda_Oliva: EPT 12F PE.T +15 74
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGJSTW 13C JAWS +38 84
#note Miscounted as 37.
>Linda_Oliva: IIII -IIII +0 74
>Morris_Greenberg: DEEEGOT 14A GEODE +31 115
#note Kind of a scary play for the board, but it is just so much better equity-wise than more conservative plays like DOE, or 9I EGO.
>Linda_Oliva: ENO 15C EON +25 99
#note Interesting choice for Linda. ONE 15A is 5 more points, but this blocks the more dangerous spot. From her perspective, I probably would've gone for the points, since the more dangerous spot will open up the bottom of the board. She probably wants this openness to come back.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEHNORT A11 THE.N +39 154
#note Lucky she didn't play ONE!
>Linda_Oliva: AIM B10 AIM +16 115
>Morris_Greenberg: EFIORTT C4 TOFTIER +64 218
>Morris_Greenberg: EFIORTT --  -64 154
#note I knew this was phony, but the options here are all pretty bad. I felt I had enough of a lead here to take the risk.
>Linda_Oliva: AF C9 FA +11 126
>Morris_Greenberg: EFIORTT D12 F... +16 170
#note Quackle slightly prefers 9I OF to set up OF->OFT.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?ADEGLR 3H LA.GeRED +70 337
#note I saw that GRAD(A)bLE was a safer play here for 4 more points, but I also thought I could gain some much needed spread by playing this (I had the lowest spread of all of the 8-4s). She already challenged a phony off, and this is a sort of funny looking word. Not to mention the fact that this would be the perfect situation to make a desperation challenge, regardless of the iffiness of the word.
>Linda_Oliva: IV -  +0 201
#note She challenged.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ABILOR K9 ORBItAL +68 405
#note Luckbox. Quackle says blocking the triple-triple wins 100% vs. 99.95% for this, but I can safely assume she doesn't have anything if she just challenged my play.

#note I forgot to write down the rest of this rack, miscounted as 42.
