>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEMRW H4 MEWER +26 26
#note I mean MEW is obvious here. Although this huge risk paid off. I was kind of confident this was not a word. I think I take the cake for phonying Edley the most :)
>Joe_Edley: DGNOUUV 5D VOGU. +18 18
#note I remember him telling me if he challenged MEWER he would have had a great opening play or VODUN or something and that I really messed up his rack.
>Joshua_Sokol: AACIIT D4 A.IATIC +26 52
#note I don't remember my last tile here, forgot to right it down. In any case this was snap-challenged. 2 technically large mistakes from Joe to start things off.

>Joe_Edley: ADFNOU I3 FADO +32 50
>Joshua_Sokol: BCEIMRS 6H ..MB +17 90
#note Given he probably won't be sure of AVIATICS, it's possible I shouldn't create more S hooks to bail him out of his lack of knowledge. I should perhaps instead play MIB C2.
>Joe_Edley: AEENTU 10D .UNEATE +13 63
#note perhaps smartly making sure that potential S hook is less of a variable.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIORS L6 SCORIAE +82 172
>Joe_Edley: EINTU H10 .UNTIE +21 84
>Joshua_Sokol: ELLNRSY E9 S.RELY +30 202
#note With two blanks unseen still, I need to be wary of Joe getting two bingos. This isn't just a play attempting to cripple immediate bingo opportunities, it's a play to try to control how open this board will get later on. 
>Joe_Edley: AZ K11 ZA +46 130
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEILNT D12 NEAT +21 223
#note After ZA, is it time to blow the board open to make sure I'm controlling what happens to it? He could have left anything from AEFGK to ??AES. In any case, I didn't see 8H (R)ATI(O)NAL, which accomplishes that very well. I also missed ALI(Y)A, which despite allowing him to score and/or set up a possible lane on the left side of the board, seems fine for other reasons that benefit me. But I don't really want that sort of variance against Edley. I was in the mentality of making sure that the left side stays as closed as possible and making sure I can still win after one or even two bingos on his end.
>Joe_Edley: JO K4 JO. +24 154
#note now this play screams blank to me, but it's possible that he doesn't have one just yet.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILOO 14G A.OLI +7 230
#note Really really not the draw I was hoping for. But it's fine, since I have things under control. That's why I did not want to play L1 OLIO. A 3x3 is a possibility that I don't want to add to Joe's ways out of this hole he's in. A play like L2 LOO allows him to open the top right of the board as well as set up a bingo lane on row 1, which is why it doesn't seem right either. 4K (J)IAO is a better play than LOO, as I keep better and make it harder to open the top of the board, albeit not impossible. In the end, I chose this very weird ultra-defensive play to take out the two 8 lanes left on the board. The risks associated with AIOLI seem only singular. And you will witness that singular risk after the click of a button.
>Joe_Edley: AKPRS 15K SPARK +44 198
#note I don't have much to say about this.

I feel like a play like SPARK, all things considered, is probably in the top 10 of worst possible responses to AIOLI. The fact that it scores so much without using up a blank, coupled with the fact that it is very difficult to overlap despite creating a good bingo lane/scoring spot on column N, made me actually cringe when it was played. But it is nowhere near a play that gets Joe right back in the game, unless certain things follow.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGILOW L1 FILO +40 270
#note I'm not entirely sure that this is my rack.

In any case, thing number one that must follow SPARK is I forgo blocking the R and open a very weak bingo lane while scoring tremendously, making sure that I am still ahead enough to outrun no bingos and even one bingo a lot of the time. FLOWE(R) (perhaps there is something to be said about GLOWE(R)) being the best play that blocks the R, a response of a bingo on column O is devastating as it usually brings Joe ahead of me on a dead board with possibly one or two blanks unseen. But that possibility is situated at around 10% in a vacuum, meaning Joe has a very small shot at a bingo next turn. The possibility of Joe having a bingo is around the same after FILO as it is after FLOWER, but it seems that I am more likely to win after FILO + his bingo vs FLOWE(R) + his bingo. On the other hand it may be that I am more likely to win in the case of Joe not having a bingo more often in the case of FLOWER than in the case of FILO. 

In any case, I still don't know if this was my rack or not...
>Joe_Edley: BERX 8K B.XER +42 240
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEGIWY M2 DIG +28 298
#note N10 WIDDE(R) is the aggressive play here. But I wanted to block the E at N8 as well as I could, and hope he couldn't hit for another turn. I missed other options for some reason. 2K W(I)DDY makes both lucrative lanes much less lucrative and N6 WE(E)DY blocks both lanes fully, leaving him with very few options to bingo. Maybe he has PIED(F)ORT or something. I think WE(E)DY is the right play. It even leaves DIG for next turn.
>Joe_Edley: ??DEIOP O1 DIsPOsE. +86 326
#note Oh that's funny, he did have PIEDFORT.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHNOWY C2 WHY +29 327
#note Based on my preendgame tracking this was my rack. 

It seems I was granted a way out of losing this game even after having made my mistakes.

This is not a good play at all!
>Joe_Edley: EGINT 2B T.INGE +28 354
>Joshua_Sokol: DELNORT 14C R.. +6 333
#note ROTL is the best endgame play, but I was trying to find a way to win, which means a play that will make Joe screw up. This probably wasn't that play.
>Joe_Edley: HNSUV 7C V.S +10 364
#note -1 to VAUS in the same spot
