#note Saw DIASTASE and wasn't sure for whatever reason.
>Steve: NOY M12 YON +23 103
>Bill: AADFLUX 11C FAD +20 94
#note This is terrible, I have two great plays: ADDAX (total miss of YOND) or FAULD, setting up AX for 52. If I had seen both I think I would've taken a chance on the setup, but instead I saw neither and made this stupid play.
>Steve: AJY 12B JAY +41 144
>Bill: ALNQUWX B12 .AW +26 120
#note I like this; every candidate play has big downsides, but with this I can play LAX for 46 next turn if he doesn't take the spot and hopefully work into a nice QU* leave.
>Steve: OPS H8 .....OPS +39 183
#note Held this for a few minutes.
>Bill: CLNOQUX 13A L.X +46 166
>Steve: KOU 8L .OUK +24 207
>Bill: CCFNOQU 13F CO.F +14 180
#note The specific plan is to hopefully draw QUENCH, but this gets the best valuation in any case.
>Steve: DIO 15L .IDO +25 232

>Steve: IMV J2 VIM +31 277
>Bill: ??AELTU 9G A.E +34 270
#note I was so happy to score 34 with two vowels and save the blanks that I didn't take a second to see UVEA in this spot. Of note: TEnAcUL(UM).
>Steve: BD 4H D..B +11 288
>Bill: ??ELTUW L1 WETs +38 308
#note He said he was setting up the S. This might be almost forced even if I had one blank given the threat of a 66+ point Z play, and it's definitely right now.
>Steve: BGNU 9B BUNG +13 301
>Bill: ?EEHLRU 1L .HEE +30 338
#note no bingos
>Steve: AZ 8A ZA +37 338
>Bill: ?AEILRU O6 AU. +7 345
#note FRAULEIN. I was in some time trouble before this and got down to about 30 seconds before slapping AUK down. Besides missing FRAULEIN, TUI would be much better given the three unseen I's.
>Steve: ANR 2L .ARN +19 357
>Bill: ?EEILRR 9G ...R +9 354
#note I hope REDLINER, RECLINER, REALISER would all be very easy if I wasn't in severe time trouble. I had to make a snap decision to either make a real search for a bingo or try to avoid overtime.
>Steve: ILO K4 .OIL +12 369
>Bill: ?EEIILR 12H .I +7 361
#note Nothing this time, but I did look for awhile and went over on time after deciding that winning without a bingo didn't seem likely.
>Steve: EINORST 15A ESTRIN +35 404
#note This actually is the best play.
>Bill: ?EEILPR D2 REPLEvI. +70 431
#note I hadn't seen my bingo through the S (ECLIPSER), but I could've gone an extra three minutes and change overtime and won with it if he made his best REPLEVIN block, so I think there's a pretty good chance I would've come up with it.
>Bill:  (O) +2 433
#note Final 423-404.
