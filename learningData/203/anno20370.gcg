>Matthew_Larocque: BDGPRTZ -BDGPT +0 0
#note I'll definitely keep the Z, but what what else? The top leaves in the sim are RT, DR, PRT, PR. None keeping the Z. Meh, I don't want Mike to get it instead.
>Mike_Ebanks: DHLOY 8H DHOLY +32 32
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEQRVZ L4 CRAZ. +38 38
#note I hated to leave DHOLY because I didn't think it was valid, but this is too good of a play for me to risk losing.
>Mike_Ebanks: CDNOO 5G CONDO. +18 50
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIJQVW 4H JEE +40 78
#note Points override the putrid leave.
>Mike_Ebanks: GLN J7 L.NG +9 59
>Matthew_Larocque: EIPQTVW 7G QI +24 102
#note LONG could spell trouble, but I think keeping the Q on my rack is more trouble.
>Mike_Ebanks: ABR 3I BRA +20 79
>Matthew_Larocque: EMPTUVW 10H VU. +7 109
#note Thought about M(A)UVE for a long time, but Mike is probably sitting on a decent rack. I wasn't 100% on LONGE so I didn't play it, I'm losing out on points here though.
>Mike_Ebanks: AILST H10 .ITALS +30 109
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMPTWW 13G W.W +17 126
>Mike_Ebanks: AB 2J BA +25 134
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEMPTY 6K Y.P +13 139
#note Not being 100% on LONGE hurts me again, otherwise EMPTY plays for 30. I debated Y(A)P vs. P(A)TY. 8 points is a lot, but keeping the T really protects me against a heavy-vowel rack. (L)EY also sims well since the M and P go together.
>Mike_Ebanks: EHI K10 HIE +23 157
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEFIMT L12 FE +20 159
#note Missed two bingos. I looked for something ending in - FIES but I didn't know the word that does that. TE(L)EFIlM would be a scary thing to play.
>Mike_Ebanks: INNRU 14J INURN +20 177
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEIMRT 15A RAIMEnT. +86 245
#note The day before, I had RAIMENTS available in a game as Quackle pointed out, and it looked just a tad unfamiliar. Literally the anagram of MINARETS. If it wasn't for that I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have scored 86 here. Unless I find pRIMATES instead. And now I know MARMITES.
>Mike_Ebanks: OT 12F TO. +8 185
#note Mike's got an S all right.
>Matthew_Larocque: DIKMTUV 15N UM +14 259
#note Have to get rid of the more dangerous spot. I'm sure Quackle will hate this even with S inference, but I think I need to protect my lead.  
>Mike_Ebanks: EE 7L .EE +18 203
>Matthew_Larocque: AADIKTV 8N TA +8 267
#note Sucks, but he'll score a heck of a lot more here than by using the STOT line. Again Quackle will surely hate this, but it's painfully obvious Mike has a good rack. I guess DAV(I)T could work out if I draw another big play at the TLS, meh.
>Mike_Ebanks: EINOSSS E6 OSSEINS +68 271
#note Would have scored 87 had I not blocked.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEIKV 8A KIVA. +39 306
>Mike_Ebanks: AGIOR C8 .IRAGO +22 293
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIOOP D4 PODI. +21 327
#note Should have just played POOED, I'm not even sure why I didn't. This wins 52% vs 56% for POOED.
>Mike_Ebanks: GLU C3 LUG +15 308
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEFOTX B2 FETED +37 364
#note Wow, what a terrible time to miss FEDEX. Everything else loses, due to the fact that he has ANKERITE, and the fact that PODI(A) allowed him to play lug and open another spot up. Two mistakes too many.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?AEENRT A6 AN.ERiTE +65 373
#note I didn't even see ANKERITE either, I assumed the K was a non-factor. I got owned.
>Mike_Ebanks:  (OX) +18 391
