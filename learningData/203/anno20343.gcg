>Emil_Rem: EEENRT 8H ENTREE +14 14
#note What is the seventh letter? Another E?
>Matthew_Larocque: AACFIOT 7K OAF +23 23
>Emil_Rem: AEH 7G HAE +16 30
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDITTZ 9M ZIT +47 70
>Emil_Rem: ILNY O6 LIN.Y +24 54
>Matthew_Larocque: ACCDTUW 6F CAW +25 95
#note Lots of options, but I hold the T for TWAE with this, and it makes it pretty hard for Emil to score.
>Emil_Rem: ADGIN K5 AD..ING +36 90
#note Or not.
>Matthew_Larocque: CDIRTUU L2 DUCI +16 111
#note Wasted too much time here. At one point I started second guessing if DUCI was a word. I know, seriously.
>Emil_Rem: ETV M1 VET +19 109
>Matthew_Larocque: ADPRTTU 2I PAD..R +24 135
#note This scores the most, but there's still seven Os and two Us unseen, so it's not nearly as defensive as I thought. 
>Emil_Rem: HOW 1G WHO +31 140
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGMTTU 3G BUTT +18 153
#note I didn't see (I)MBUE even though I was aware of that spot. Not sure how wise that would be......
>Emil_Rem: EO 1M .OE +20 160
>Matthew_Larocque: BEFGMOR 4F GEM +20 173
#note I wanted to play FROM but it gave up easy points. This kills the board and turns it into a race to who has an S first. Seeing how none have been played, he probably has one. So what do I do instead?
>Emil_Rem: IQS 9F QIS +20 180
>Matthew_Larocque: BFOPRSU 5N OF +17 190
#note Failed to see VETO plays.
>Emil_Rem: GNOOR 11H GOR.ON +8 188
>Matthew_Larocque: BPRRSUY 12L YUP +28 218
#note Here's where I lost the game. I was about 75% sure that GURRY was a word, but eventually I chickened out and played YUP. I figured if I lost my turn and he killed this spot, I'd probably be in trouble. Unfortunately the BRRS leave got me into trouble too.
>Emil_Rem: ELLS O12 SELL +25 213
>Matthew_Larocque: BIMRRRS I11 .RB +8 226
#note What an absolutely crappy position. If I knew BRIS (still don't know the fours) then that should be the standout play, for 23 at 10D. Otherwise I think an exchange might be the best thing, there's still blanks to be had. This play doesn't accomplish anything.
>Emil_Rem: AEX H13 AXE +34 247
#note Except give him 34 points.
>Matthew_Larocque: IMORRSU 14E ROU. +13 239
#note Meltdown: Engaged. I can't even make a decent overlap unless I want to play SOM. Wait, MORRIS is a word? Well, that sucks.
>Emil_Rem: DEN 15D DEN +10 257
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIMRS 10D AMI +20 259
#note I had a feeling either *TARAMIS or TAMARIS was valid but I couldn't afford to guess here. Also AMBARIS. This play opens but also gives him a chance to score big. 
>Emil_Rem: AINS 11C ANIS +30 287
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AIJRST 12A JoTAS +51 310
#note Fishing off the J wins 78%, this is a distant second in the low 60s. I was almost out of time, and an overtime penalty would assure that I lost, so I slapped down JOTAS.
>Emil_Rem: ?EEIKLO A12 .OKE +45 332
#note Emil can also win by blocking my out. I went through each scenario of the last letter in the bag. Seems like half the letters win (?EEO) while KVIL lose.
>Matthew_Larocque: IRV 14L VIR. +14 324
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?EIL) +6 330
#note Painful way to start the tournament, but I really fumbled after wussing on GURRY.
