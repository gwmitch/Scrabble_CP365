#note Almost laid down PERIGIA* here but I actually knew better. I'm quite happy to counterexchange here after Marlon's exchange, given his rack is better than average now. I never like to make a play like PIG anyway, keeping 3 vowels and either getting a bingo or scoring almost nothing a huge amount of the time next turn.
>Marlon_Hill: AEGHOR 8C GHERAO +28 28
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEIPRS 7E BAP +23 23
#note Hard 8 to find here that I missed. SPARERIB is not only something I haven't studied, it's something I don't even plan on approaching for the rest of my life! Go Veggie! :P. Otherwise this play looks right, scores and keeps well, doesn't force me to bingo next turn to score or stay in the game. I realized GHERAOS* was invalid, so it's a good thing that I'm forking the board. Actually, maybe 9G BI is the right play here, since it scores decently and gives me a few low-value bingo lanes to work with next turn.
>Marlon_Hill: COOTZ 6C COOT +18 46
#note Marlon flashed a Z here and laid down ZOOT*. Good thing he didn't play it. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIPRRS 9G PRAISER +76 99
#note Marlon is a bit more likely than average to be holding an S here, but if he doesn't this is by far the best play. I don't know if I should still just play REPAIRS in the same spot though. That is a bit safer.
>Marlon_Hill: EEIZ K9 .EIZE +28 74
#note held just to make sure the I and the E were in the right spots!
>Joshua_Sokol: FIOOOUU 12I OU.O +26 125
#note I really had no intention of playing through this rack, but Marlon gave me one of so few things that would make it worth it.
>Marlon_Hill: ?GISTUV L3 oUTGIV.S +82 156
>Joshua_Sokol: FILORUW 6J FU.IO +19 144
#note I seem to remember playing this word fast. I don't know why I didn't look for other stuff for longer. If I want to play volatile after a 7-tile pickup by none other than the patently unlucky Marlon Hill, I can go with 14J FROW, which I must have missed or too quickly dismissed. But a regular and completely fine play is 11E WOFUL. This was a ploy to get him scared, I guess
>Marlon_Hill: ARY 8L .ARY +32 188
#note but the ploy was too easily taken care of
>Joshua_Sokol: DELNRWY M1 WRY +26 170
#note Yet again there are other options I must have overlooked... M2 WYN is much safer and even has a far stronger leave than WRY, and 13J N(E)WLY is more balanced and defensive. I saw NEWLY after WRY and was frustrated with myself, which nver helps! Also, 14J WRY is just plain better than this, not only points wise. He's just gonna cash on the many hooks of SEIZE so often
>Marlon_Hill: ADNW 14K DAWN +32 220
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILNN 15L NEED +28 198
#note perhaps I made a decent play here!
>Marlon_Hill: FK J8 K.F +32 252
>Joshua_Sokol: DIILNNR 5I LIN. +17 215
#note trying to keep things open. I'm now in a lot of trouble.
>Marlon_Hill: BE 1M .EB +24 276
>Joshua_Sokol: DHINNRS B2 HINDS +31 246
#note was absolutely not happy to feel the need to play this, but it was too many points. I need to stay in this game and be patient
>Marlon_Hill: CIMM 3A M.MIC +22 298
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ENOORT A1 RO.EO +35 281
#note I think I saw both of the 7s, CORONET and ENROOTS, but I decided that I would be in a better position if I played ROMEO. I didn't know HONEWORT, which plays at D8. That looks worth it to me. Given that I forwent so many bingos this tournament, I don't feel like I can unbiasedly explain why I didn't bingo. It was probably a mix of fearing a bad drag and fearing a big snapback play by Marlon. This was almost challenged, FWIW.
>Marlon_Hill: AQT 10F QAT +43 341
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENNTT 13C TaNNATE +69 350
#note almost chickened out of TANNATE and played TENANTS, but that would have been a very bad choice.
>Marlon_Hill: AILX 11D AXIL +42 383
#note Marlon almost missed this, it was a very good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEJLTUV 10B JUT +28 378
#note I had 1) mistracked and 2) forgotten about E(LINT) until now, but I had to hope he messed up, perhaps by missing ELINT.
>Marlon_Hill: DEEGILS H1 GLIDES +35 418
#note SLEDGE is one more, but whatever
>Joshua_Sokol: AELV 12A VEAL +30 408
