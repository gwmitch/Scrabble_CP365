>Joey: EILSSUX 8H SILEX +40 40
>Josh: EGLNNNY -IIII +0 0
#note Exchanged LYNN, kept ENG. Nothing seemed worth playing. Many things are. I was kind of already on tilt...
>Joey: DEFHSUU 9K FUD +23 63
>Josh: EGLNPRR K6 PR..ER +22 22
>Joey: EHNRSUZ 7H UH +20 83
>Josh: ADGLNOP J10 PONG +25 47
#note Really don't understand why I would play J10 POD here. My bingo chances after POD are really not as Quackle thinks.
>Joey: AEMNRSZ 6K .REZ +35 118
>Josh: AACDDES 9C ADDACES +76 123
>Josh: AACDDES --  -76 47
#note I was relatively confident this was a word, even though I knew that you can never know with -X to -CES words. I didn't think ADDAX was a type of AX, which it isn't, and I didn't know of the "rule" that it's -R_X words mostly that become -R_CES. I also don't study enough. But it seemed like I was in a terrible position if I didn't play this. Joey didn't instantly challenge, at least.
>Joey: AGLMNST 7M MAG +27 145
#note Josh: MAT seems to make more sense here. Keeping the G isn't so bad and it sets up ZAG/GO/TO next turn if he draws one of the 7 O's.
>Josh: AACDDES 9F ACED +24 71
#note Maybe just GAD but I feel like I'm gonna need more than 1 bingo to come back, so it seems I need to keep that G open and hope it stays that way.
>Joey: ELNOSTT E6 TONLETS +72 217
>Josh: ADIJNST 8A DJIN. +42 113
#note The only other thing that makes sense here is just JIN(N), setting up my D, cause I'm in a whole lot of trouble. 
>Joey: ABEIKMO B6 KO.I +25 242
#note Josh: F6 AMI(A) looks like a better play than this. It cripples the top half of the board more effectively than KOJI, scores more and retains very good scoring tiles. The upside of KOJI is that it keeps (G)AMB or (G)AMBE for next turn, which I imagine is why Joey played it.
>Josh: AEILNST O7 .ELATINS +80 193
>Joey: ABEIIMN N10 BIMA +32 274
>Josh: HILRRWY F8 Y.H +47 240
#note It may be better to play WHY or WRY at M13. I took the points cause I was coming back within range again.
>Joey: ?EEINOO D12 OE +8 282
#note Josh: in game, I thought this was a really bad play, no matter what Joey had, save maybe something like OES??. It doesn't score, it doesn't really block much... Joey told me his rack afterwards and I was like "you really didn't have an S?! I was hoping for some of his thought process in his annotated game, but no dice. I think he missed (YAH)OO F8. I don't know if he considered 12C EO(S)INE either. Either of those look better for sure. This allowed me to get back in the game.
>Josh: ILORRRW -AAAAUU +0 240
#note Unfortunately I was unable to justify playing through this rack.
>Joey: ?EINOQT F5 QI +17 299
>Josh: BCO C12 COB +23 263
>Joey: ?AENNOT M9 .ONATE +33 332
#note Not crazy about opening up this lane without an actual S, but it's hard to pass up this many points.
