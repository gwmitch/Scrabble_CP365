#note This play is really bad. I was largely set on GLOM 2F, but Q doesn't appear to like that either. It chooses GLIME2F, a play I'd make had I seen it.

>Gunther_Jacobi: ABGIIIK C2 BIG +18 132
#note Ranks toward the bottom of the list of options. Q like 1M (F)IG or (F)IB. Believe it or not, BIKI(E) O4 even leads BIG.

#note Held here for some time...REBOOK seemed odd visually to me, but it's valid.
>Gunther_Jacobi: GIIQTUU 7K G.U +11 245
#note Quackle plays this over all limited options. Glad I found it...I'm striving for (L)IQUATE or LIQUIDS...

#note This is invalid. I held for a long time, wanted to challenge. SWINGED seemed correct, so I began to wonder why he'd play this if it wasn't good. Being that the game is surely out of reach after accepting this, should really make this a forced challenge considering my high skepticism of it.

#note I'm seeing TELLURIC and CLITORAL in a perfect world. Q says (MA)CL(E), a play I'd have made had I seen it. Instead I play a phony Dean holds on, but can afford to let go.
