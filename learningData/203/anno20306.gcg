#note sim prefers MAW at C12 by a couple, if she does play on column B then I should have counterplay, so now I agree

#note I didn't like burning the blank because I thought I could aim for a J play at 2J, and EJECTA gives back easy plays to the triple. but the alternative is the significant antisynergy of holding the blank and a power tile with no outstanding spots to score with the J or X. 2nd best is JAGER holding CX?. My play gives up too many easy points.

#note nice idea to turn over tiles and block the L and P, but...

#note this is a very encouraging move for me because she's playing the last I - I don't have to worry about the GWINE spot and an -ING bingo as much

#note a mistaken pre-endgame because I failed to recognize the possibility of ORGANON if I draw GU out of the bag. In these cases the best thing to do is to write out all the alphagrams and stare at them for a bit. in that case, I would've seen ORGANON and played something to block like BEAK.
