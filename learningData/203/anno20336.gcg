>Morris_Greenberg: DEEFGHR 8D HEDGE +28 28
#note I wasn't sure of HEDGER.
>Paul_Erland: EILNOT D2 NEOLIT. +20 20
>Morris_Greenberg: BCDEFRT 3C D.FECT +30 58
#note Even though I am not sure of HEDGER, I saw that this board could get messy quickly, and that R migth be necessary to keep. That is what separated DEFECT from BEREFT for me.
>Paul_Erland: EJNO H1 JE.ON +39 59
>Morris_Greenberg: ABHKRRW I4 HAWK +26 84
#note Still not sure of HEDGER, why risk it for something only slightly worse? WARK I6 is obviously the play if I know HEDGER. If I want to keep the HEDGER possibility alive, K(E)RB or K(E)BAR F2 are also worth consideration.
>Paul_Erland: ORZ F2 Z.RO +33 92
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEEGRR J5 BEAR +26 110
>Paul_Erland: DEM K4 MED +31 123
>Morris_Greenberg: AEFGIRU L1 AGUE +20 130
#note I was choosing between AGUE and RUGA here, as there are so few E's left. Ultimately, I decided to keep the R, since the game has been consonant heavy thus far (so more vowels than usual in the bag). Quackle likes RUGA more, though likes FIRE, FARE and FRAE even more. Scoring 10 extra points here I am not sure is worth it. The counterplays will be richer for Paul after those, and they keep a worse leave (especially FARE/FRAE, with 7 I's unseen) There probably isn't a clearly best option here, and all 5 of these plays seem reasonable.
>Paul_Erland: ALX 1L .XAL +33 156
#note (F)LAX would've been 9 more. A 1 point difference it turns out from FIRE in this scenario!
>Morris_Greenberg: ABFIIRV 2J VA.I +25 155
#note VI(G)IA. I suck.
>Paul_Erland: S M1 ..S +24 180
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BFIIRY E6 FI.RY +18 173
>Paul_Erland: IIIOUUU -IIIOUUU +0 180
#note This was a mild shock to me. I just assumed after (XI)S Paul had a good rack that was close to a bingo
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BIPRTW 10B WIR. +18 191
#note Quackle slightly prefers BIT D10. I am comfortable not opening it up quite yet in this situation, Paul very likely has to here anyways. BRIT D10 is also worth consideration.
>Paul_Erland: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 180
#note Geez.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BGNPRT C9 B.G +9 200
>Paul_Erland: UV G8 .UV +8 188
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ANPRTT 2J ....NA +26 226
>Paul_Erland: EEPSU 8J .UPEES +33 221
>Morris_Greenberg: ?INPRTT L8 .RINT +14 240
#note I didn't know TuRN(S)PIT, but that doesn't look right here anyways. Quackle (interestingly) likes PINT and TINT 9K the best, but I saw that backfiring quickly if Paul bingos starting with an S at 11G. (P)RINT likely gives me a few options for a bingo next turn, which is what I need.
>Paul_Erland: IQ K10 QI +37 258
#note Maybe that's why Quackle didn't like PRINT as much.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ADPTUY J11 DUTY +20 260
#note I thought YAUP and YAUD were too risky here with SS? still unseen, Quackle slightly prefers it, and PYA 7M, which I also think is not as good here, since I don't want to close those lines.
>Paul_Erland: MOO 7M MOO +19 277
>Morris_Greenberg: ??AILOP 13D POLArI.y +60 320
#note I didn't have much time left, so I didn't have time to see better bingos. For this play, I wanted to find a play that wouldn't give large counterplays on the triple, and also not allowing many counter-bingos beneath it. The L early on in the word helps this, but dIPLOmA(T) or gAlLIpO(T) was what I was looking for but ran out of time to see.
>Paul_Erland: R N6 R.. +5 282
>Morris_Greenberg: CENOSTT F11 CO.S +8 328
#note I saw the possibility of 14B ANISOLE, and wanted to be sure I didn't open up another bingo line in the process of blocking. I didn't have much time to analyze plays that didn't sacrifice as much spread. This is one of only 6 100% wins Quackle sees, TEN or NET 12E is a bit better, same with SOT 12C, and I probably could have seen those if I thought about playing over. (r)OC also wins always, but I wouldn't have been sure enough of nothing playing on row 15 given my time. The really brilliant one is E12 T(O), blocking ANISOLE, and leaving 1 in the bag with a strong leave.
>Paul_Erland: AEIILNS 6B NA..S +28 310
#note NE(IF)S, to have ILIA in two spots next turn.
>Morris_Greenberg: AENOTT M11 TAO +13 341
#note Yeah, better ones were available. I had under a minute.
>Paul_Erland: EIIL 14C LEI. +10 320
>Morris_Greenberg: ENT N12 TEN +11 352
>Morris_Greenberg:  (I) +2 354
