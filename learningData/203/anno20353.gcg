>Matthew_Larocque: EIMOOWX 8D MOXIE +34 34
>Paul_Sidorsky: ADEIMST 9E MISDATE +81 81
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FGNOTW F6 FO..NG +27 61
#note W(E)FT keeps a better leave, but scores 7 less. Quackle says it's close.
>Paul_Sidorsky: GPY 7H GYP +18 99
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DRRTUW L7 WUD +20 81
#note Or DURR, but I didn't want to keep the W another turn.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AGINP 11D PA.ING +20 119
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AERRTV 12A VERA +30 111
#note Didn't know VERATRUM. Also thought about VAR for defense, but decided to take the points since I'm the one trailing.
>Paul_Sidorsky: OOT 6I OOT +16 135
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEKRT 5G TACKiER +93 204
#note Played it safe instead of trying TACKERS which could have conceivably been phony. RACKETS, RACKETY, and RETACKS also score 95.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ADILORS B6 DARIOL.S +65 200
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINQRT 9A Q. +11 215
#note At least this blocks the newly created hotspot.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AHW 4K WHA +35 235
#note But he didn't need it anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRTZ H11 .ERTZ +45 260
#note Not what I was hoping to draw, but at least I still get 45 points.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ILR A12 .IRL +23 258
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINNV E2 NAEVI +21 281
#note Tough turn for me, I was going to play 4D VENIN at first. I didn't like the risk of him scoring big with FA HA, etc. so I changed. This gives more floaters for an 8, but nothing I play here will be foolproof. 
>Paul_Sidorsky: ELRY D1 RELY +30 288
#note NAIVE instead of NAEVI would have stopped this.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEINNTU H1 NUBI. +24 305
#note I saw UNB(EN)T but not the bingo. I think maybe I neglected to look at the bottom half of the board. This ended up being the game-losing miss.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ?CEIJSU 14C JESUI.iC +74 362
#note Held but this seemed vaguely familiar. He could have easily taken points for his J keeping the blank so I assumed he knew the word for sure. Plus, it anagrams into JUSTICES.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHNOOOT 15C OHO +30 335
>Paul_Sidorsky: BDEEIT A1 BETIDE +33 395
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENOST C3 ATES +24 359
#note Lucky for him I did not have (N)EONATES to bingo out. I didn't get a chance to see if he had an out, but champ says blocking doesn't really make a difference in spread anyways because he'll just score 24 next turn.
>Paul_Sidorsky: EFLNU 1F FU.NEL +9 404
>Paul_Sidorsky:  (ANO) +6 410
#note I went over so I lost 10 points. UNBITTEN would have helped my chances since he probably makes a JAR play and then I crunch down on the TWS.
