>Morris_Greenberg: ?AEELRY 7H sEALERY +67 67
#note I have played Darrell once before, and I remembered it ending up as a very tight board. This is exactly what I don't want to do with that kind of player. I missed LEAt(H)ERY for 76, A(V)ERsELY for 73, and LAYER(A)gE for 70, but I shoud play a more open bingo for less points even if I don't see those bigger 3. Misscored as 66.
>Darrell_Day: EW 6J WE +29 113
>Morris_Greenberg: AHNOOQR M3 HONO. +16 83
#note HOORA(Y).
>Darrell_Day: ACDEINT 4H CATEN.ID +82 195
#note (sO)NICATED! But, this definitely looks better, since SONICATED opens the board wide up, and with Darrell's lead, that is unwanted.
>Morris_Greenberg: ACLQRUU O1 QUA. +42 125
>Darrell_Day: AEM 9C MAE +15 210
>Morris_Greenberg: CILMRTU H1 MUL.T +27 152
#note Maybe (HA)ULM instead to give access to the bottom of the board?

>Darrell_Day: ADEPT 9H PATED +24 240
>Morris_Greenberg: CEEGRTV 10J ERECT +26 222
#note With Darrell shutting down left and right, I like taking the points here. I straight up missed the V(OMIT) hook to be fair, but this looks fine to me.
>Darrell_Day: OX 8N OX +32 272
>Morris_Greenberg: EFGINNV L9 ..FINE +20 242
#note This was a mistake. I wanted to open up an -ING lane that was unlikely to get blocked, but on average, this allows far too much back. (DE)VEIN does this a lot better, and I missed it at the time.
>Darrell_Day: ILU 14J LI.U +6 278
#note I am lucky he had nothing.
>Morris_Greenberg: FGINOPV 15G GONIF +34 276
>Darrell_Day: ABEINS O10 SABINE +41 319
>Morris_Greenberg: AEKLPRV K3 L.V.. +16 292
#note How did I miss K(E)V(E)L? That is clearly a better option. LEKVAR is also cool, though I would rather make a fishier play here to worry Darrell more since he is quite defensive.
>Darrell_Day: ORW 5E WOR. +14 333
>Morris_Greenberg: AEKNPRR 11E PARKER +33 325
#note If only I drew the S instead of the N. Quackle slightly prefers 6A PARKER, but I don't really see why.
>Darrell_Day: BEJU 6B JUBE +34 367
#note Oh, that's why.
>Morris_Greenberg: ADINOSY B10 .OYSIA +36 361
#note Best. Darrell thought SYNODIA(L)* was a word and was probably terrified in his head for about 8 minutes while I searched for a non-existent valid win.
>Darrell_Day: ?DGST F2 DaG.S +28 395
#note D(I)GesT, D(I)GhTS, or D(I)GiTS nets 1 more. Misscored as 29 though, so it works out the same!
>Morris_Greenberg: DN 15A D.N +12 373
#note My first 2 plays were two of my largest mistakes, and I couldn't really recover the rest of the game from them. I was almost able to claw back, but Darrell controlled the game from the start.
