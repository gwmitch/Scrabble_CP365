#note This is not a mathematically sound play, for all sorts of reasons, and has really undesirable entropy.  It's more reasonable with a rack like EEINNRS, but certainly not this rack.

#note Yikes.  Not a good accept by player 2: now with some word knowledge errors.

#note AIRFARE is better for a host of reasons (more points, first shot at the Q and X, better long term entropy) but this is forgivable.
>Opponent: CELLNOS 8A CLONE +29 141
>Player_2: AAEEEOR 7D AREA +13 154
#note Missed AREOLA, but even without that, this isn't a good play.  Something like OCREAE is far better.  AREA is just unsound with a terrible leave that does nothing good to the board.  Really bad defense.

>Player_2: ADDOOTX B14 DO +14 248
#note This is crazy.  The S is not a big deal, keeping the X is not a great idea, and it's really bad defense done badly.  This is conducive to information from the last game: this player has no idea how to close the board.  DOAT/DATO is probably best, although just outscoring with OXID is fine as well.
>Opponent: CEIKSST 14F SICKEST +75 224
>Player_2: ABDNOTX 13E BOX +39 287
#note Playing BOX here as opposed to M1 is just ludicrous, as BOX creates another scoring spot which is great when ahead, blocks, and has far better long term entropy.  This is pretty clearly an example of not knowing how to close a board and why.
>Opponent: ?AGMOPV K5 PA.VO +30 254
>Player_2: ADEHNTU 3F UNHEAT.D +78 365
#note Gets away with the errors, but Player 2 exhibits a pretty solid example of misunderstanding defense and long term entropy, as well as some technical flubs in other facets of Scrabble.  To counteract this, we should actually behave much like Player 1: we should put ourselves in higher entropy situations early, knowing that if we get behind it's not as big of a deal against this player and if we get ahead, we can block the board and probably win a huge percentage of the time against Player 2.
