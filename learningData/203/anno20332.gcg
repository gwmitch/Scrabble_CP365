#note I saw the best-simming play, COVEY, but passed it up. What I failed to recognize was that there are 6 Is remaining, and therefore the leave of GMT has a chance of turning into an -ING bingo on column L. quackle also likes GROVE at K10 which I don't think will work so well against a human opponent. my play is alright.

#note it looks like I'm a slight underdog to win. I did not come up with quackle's favorite play of GIE at O7. I have a nice chance of drawing bingos from the C with my CEOR leave like CICERONE/CICERONI, COCINERA etcetera...too bad for me I missed the possibility, because I actually ended up drawing AIN which would've given me COCINERA for the win!!! If only I'd seen the possibility.

#note unfortunately he has CILIATE to go out, which I have to block. CERING is one better because if he plays TAILER as he actually did, I can response with GOA/AZINE and only lose by 3.
