>Terry_Kang_Rau: AK H7 KA +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEFIRU I5 BRIEF +24 24
#note I wasn't entirely sure of anything here, so I opted not to lose another turn. But it's interesting to try and figure out what Terry may or may not have challenged. I wrote down FUBBIER#, FIREBUG and BUFFIER. FUBSIER is the other one I missed and I think I knew.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AE J5 AE +12 24
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EMNNOU K2 NOUMENa +83 107
#note Terry was fascinated that I managed to draw a bingo after a five-tile play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: A 8K .A +2 26
>Joshua_Sokol: CGGRSSZ 3I GR.SZ +34 141
#note There is actually something to be said about playing GR(O)GS here instead of GR(O)SZ, especially since Terry is fishing. I'm going to be scoring well for sure with my CSZ leave, much more than with CGS. And I don't give her a potent 7 lane, assuming she knows/sees GROSZE.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AEIINST M7 ISATINE +70 96
#note Interested to know the logic of this over 10H ISATINE for 72 and opening more ways for Terry to get back in the game.
>Joshua_Sokol: CGHIOOS 12G CHOOSI.G +86 227
#note sure would have prevented this lucky anomaly.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BN L11 B.N +11 107
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIPRRT H11 C.IRP +36 263
#note I don't know if I saw PRE(CHOOSING) as a possible extension, but I sure would not have been sure enough of it to play it. It would be the right play here if I knew it, since it would likely garner a challenge.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: GINPU 15G U.PING +13 120
>Joshua_Sokol: EELRTVY N2 VEERY +54 317
#note Wondering if EVERTLY was a word. It isn't.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: IX 14J XI +52 172
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHLOOT L1 HO.T +28 345
#note Everything this game was just me autopiloting. I probably missed OHO and OOH at O6. I think I saw OLEO though. Not sure of my logic other than points.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ATW F13 WAT +20 192
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELOOT O6 OLEO +17 362
#note Vowel/Consonant ratio is 13/19, but A and E are the most likely candidate vowels for me to draw and it doesn't hurt to score 6 more and dig deeper into the bag here, so I think OLEATE is better. I was probably just trying to be able to respond to bingos better, but I will be able to do that anyway. Otherwise, the Q is just as likely to be drawn as the blank, so by that logic it doesn't seem huge to go for turnover here. But OLEATE still looks better
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 192
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEOOTT 11K O..A +19 381
#note I guess I knew I was to draw two O's instead of an E or an A!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AW J9 AW +18 210
>Joshua_Sokol: DELLOTT G8 TEL +7 388
#note why not
>Terry_Kang_Rau: MY 9L M.Y. +13 223
#note I guess TEL is a bit crazy cause it leaves a hail mary line open, giving Terry the possibility to further open the board and bingo 3 times. I think I probably missed (TEL)I(C)!
>Joshua_Sokol: DDDELOT E10 EDDO +17 405
#note A really autopilot-y move! Maybe I should exchange. Was probably traumatized from the game before last's EDDOS* debacle.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AAEEEII -AAEEEII +0 223
#note I think I wrote down her exchanging everything? Is that possible?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADDLNT D12 ADD +23 428
#note autopilot. I rarely have games like this one!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: F 4N .F +9 232
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALNRTV C6 VeNTRAL +64 492
#note lol I should probably wait for the sake of maybe not getting Q-stuck
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EEIJRST 15A JETS +43 275
#note She must have drawn the J? Not that it mattered. VeNTRAL was perfect...
>Joshua_Sokol: EILQUU 7A QU.UE +13 505
#note -4 to just QU(A). I probably wanted her to get 300.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EIR A7 .I +33 308
