#note this is it! I got to live the dream of playing nigel richards on the last day of nationals.
>Nigel_Richards: ABP 7H BAP +18 18
>JD: ANNOOTU 9F NOTA +28 54
#note TOON or NOON would both be better here while only being a little bit less defensive.
>Nigel_Richards: DENSV K3 VENDS +26 44
>JD: EGLMNOU 10E MUG +23 77
#note I almost played LUG here, but settled on MUG. In general I spent too long on these plays, trying to make them perfect...GLUE is a sharp way of reducing his comebacks at this spot (the reason why I considered LUG in the first place). but actually, the sim winner overall is OVUM at 3J, which leaves the more bingo prone leave of EGLN (no Is played) and cleverly sets up a lane for an -ING bingo.
>Nigel_Richards: ?HINRRT 4E THoRNI.R +72 116
>JD: AEEILNO 11C AEON +19 96
#note ODE at 6J is a very sharp way of opening a new lane on an already closed board.
>Nigel_Richards: ALUU 3C LUAU +15 131
>JD: BEGILTW C8 BEW.IL +24 120
#note I wasn't a huge fan of WILT at 12A. BEWAIL seemed to give up fewer cheap points. however, on a sim WILT and BEWAIL are about the same on defense and for me next turn - which means that I should just take the points.

#note nigel's actual rack

#note oh dear, now I'm in huge trouble.
>JD: AKNOPRR A12 .ORP +21 202
#note since the K seemed extremely hard to bingo from, I figurd I'd sacrifice the points to put a P at 15A.
>Nigel_Richards: CDIO 1G ODIC +26 293
>JD: AAEKMNR 6K .ANK +19 221
#note I thought DANK took the S for some reason - the R is much more useful than the M, but DARK may be scarier. I could also just play OKA at 2A and fish, but that doesn't seem likely to end well. maybe DRAKE at 6K is right?

>Nigel_Richards: AILT N2 TILA. +18 357
>JD: ACEEEFR 13F FEE +15 261
#note that last play sure makes it look like he has the X. quackle comes up with the clever EAVE at 3I to block that spot...but maybe I should just fish for a bingo of my own and let him take his points.

>JD:  (EIILRV) +18 358
#note it was a funny feeling - this is probably the most important game of the year, and yet it was pretty anti-climactic after MOSEYING. Though I got sort of close in the middle, NIgel dominated this game, and I also played too slow at the beginning and struggled to find my best options. In particular, I am disappointed that I missed ODE at 6J. Ultimately, I think I played fine, but not the best that I am capable of - and hopefully if I get the chance to play him next year on day 5 of nationals I'll do a better job. At least after this game I had a great chance of coming 3rd if I won at least one of my last two - as well as an outside shot at 2nd.
