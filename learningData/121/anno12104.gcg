>Jerry_Lerman: CEHMR 8D MERCH +30 30
#note I had had disproprtionately good luck against jerry in the past before entering this game.
>JD: ADEGOOY E5 GOO.Y +18 18
#note GOOEY didn't feel great, but I totally whiffed on the easy frontrunner of OOGAMY. I was not feeling that great on the morning of Day 3.

>JD: EIJKTVW B11 JI.K +30 119
#note quite the draw of EJKW - taking the three extra points for JIVE looks quite good. Unintuitively, quackle also likes WIVE at B1 quite a bit, holding the J and hoping to play at C9 next turn. Either play looks superior to my choice.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEGNRRS 12G RANGERS +74 244
>JD: EEENTVW 11K WEE +26 145
#note I need good lanes to work with, but I figured that he would block the S anyway at some point, so I might as well play here in such a way that I till had lanes to work with. Looking at it now I might prefer WEET or WEEN to up the volatility at the cost of a worse leave.
>Jerry_Lerman: IMS 15A ISM +31 275
>JD: AAEENTV B2 AVE +17 162
#note FAVE may be a better play here, since it opens a new lane without giving up so many easy points as I do with AVE at B2.

>JD: ABENOTV 14F ABOVE +27 189
>Jerry_Lerman: ABDILOP 5G BIPODAL +78 431
#note jerry!!! I held this, and something about it looked wrong, but I let TRIPODAL talk me into accepting it. Only BIPEDAL is good. this is phony.

>Jerry_Lerman: AFLR 8L FARL +46 477
>JD: ADEORUU 3B .AU +12 268
>Jerry_Lerman: LO 15J LO +4 481
#note jerry correctly spotted that there was a good chance I would hit him with ROQUET here, and that I may have been fishing for it when I played VAU. This is not actually the case, but it was a nice inference.
>JD: DEOOQRU 2G ROQUE +19 287
#note quackle likes fishing the Q and going for OUTRODE to cut spread, but I strongly suspect JERRY would block. I could also fish for QUOTA but that would also be unlikely to stay open.
>Jerry_Lerman: CIRTTTU 4J TIT +15 496
>JD: DOP 10M POD +13 300
#note low on time, I missed my spot for 5 extra one to the left.
>JD:  (CRTU) +12 312
#note thus ended my streak of 15 blanks in a row.
