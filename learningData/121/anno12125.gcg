#note Didn't like any of the plays. Especially the ones that gave away my second S. I think this is ok.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDDELNO M9 D.ONED +20 88
#note L9 DEED sims better, which is surprising. I didn't think CLNO would be better than just CL. I kind of wanted to block up the board after Lou's small turnover, but DRONED doesn't accomplish that. Leaving the S open is fine as it is a weak line.

#note This play is bad, bad, bad. I couldn't recall ARIARY, but B2 AVIARY is obviously fine. Why didn't I like it? I think the reason is that if I was going to let Lou have a triple, I wanted to set up one for myself, too. But AAI sucks. Bad play!

#note Too many bad mistakes in this one. DRONED wasn't awful, but a mistake. VARY and ABY just weren't good enough and Lou was able to capitalize.
