#note Actually what happened is: Jerry played 're steals', which is just ridiculous, and really I needed to challenge it, since it was ridiculous.  This is what he should have played.  Somehow I thought I could survive the endgame.  I got so into calculating the endgame (while he was on hold) that I decided it would be more fun to try out the endgame I'd calculated than to even reconsider challenging the play.  The right anagrams are RESLATES STARLESS STEALERS.  I will try to remember.

#note I guess I missed TAUON or calculated it wrong

#note Another cool choice is CRYP(TIC)

#note There's NO at DJIN(N) (T)O for 17.  Also at H8 (N)ON(POINT) for 13 is awesome.

#note Our math was off by just 1 point and we reported a loss by 10 for me, 464-454.  In hindsight I wonder what was wrong with me that I didn't make the right decisions in this one.  Was I more tired than usual? Tournament too long? It's been a stressful few days as we drove all the way from Austin on Thursday. My lodgings and meals and transportation aren't exactly plush but on the plus side I have some friends with me, and that's worth a lot.
