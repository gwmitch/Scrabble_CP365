>Jim_Burlant: ELLPSUW 8C UPSWELL +80 80
#note Didn't know UPWELLS, which would have played at 8B for 82 and been a better choice for defensive reasons.  The sim says this is roughly a 2-1/2 point dog and wins not quite 3/4% less often than UPWELLS 8B.  For this game, it was a 25-point dog given his next rack.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EINQTT C7 Q.INTET +54 54
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIOU -AAEIOU +0 80
#note  Not seeing an R for AUREI/URAEI, I didn't even think of playing through with this.  One scoring option worth consideration is 7B AQUA.  This is best; exchange 7 is almost as good in Quackle's eyes.  Unless the pool is down to dregs and has a disproportionate number of E's, I don't see a reason to ever throw all my E's back into the bag.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AGNV E4 VANG. +18 72
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEFGM D12 FACE +32 112
#note A D12 play was obviously the call, but which one?  I considered FAG, this, and FAME.  At the time, the extra 6 points and tile turned swayed me, but this is needlessly volatile.  FAG wins 57.75%; this wins 55.3 and sims 6 points down.  Quackle is right:  FAG should have been the play.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BJU 15A JUB. +39 111
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: DDGIMNR G4 GRIM.D +15 127
#note No really good options available so I figured I'd just dump the rack and try again.  As long as he doesn't have something like ORZO/MOZO/BOZO in his rack, I didn't think I'd get too badly burned by this, and with 62 tiles still in the bag, I'm not going to worry about the lone Z.  Q just wants me to dump the M and the D with G7 MED for 11.  Just shy of 50% to win; MED wins 53.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EEKLUU I3 UKULE.E +14 125
>Jim_Burlant: DEFNNOS H1 FON +20 147
#note The only 8 in this rack is FONDNESS, and it doesn't play.  This is best - nothing else worth consideration.  62% to win.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BOO 4I .OBO +20 145
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINST J6 INSTEAD +83 230
#note Bingos all over the board with this rack, but this outscores the next best bingo - J8 STAINED - by 4 points.  This is best.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AHI 5K AHI +25 170
>Jim_Burlant: DEIILOR 3L OI +10 240
#note Without an S or Z available, there are no 8's.   I just looked to fish, hoping to bingo on rows 11 or 12.  Q's top choice makes a lot of sense here:  B9 LOID leaves EIR and scores 22.  I'm still winnning 82% but this game is about to get interesting.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: MY K10 MY +28 198
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILRR F8 .ARD +13 253
#note Had absolutely no clue what to do with this.  This isn't one of the kibitzer choices and it sims mid-pack.  Best is another B9 play, LAIR, which scores 20.  Rightly or wrongly, I'd gotten into the mindset that I wasn't going to turn more than 3 tiles out of these high-prob racks unless I could score in the high 20's with them.  
>Mark_Przybyszewski: CEE F2 CEE +18 216
>Jim_Burlant: EGILORY 1H .OGEY +16 269
#note Not one of the original choices, this actually is the second best option I have from the standpoint of winning percentage   I thought that, with my fishes not yielding anything good and his dumping surplus E's, that he was dangerously close to something - I wanted to make sure he didn't score 80+ on row 1.  This sacrifices a bit of equity to 2B YOGIC  (which I didn't even see, as I was fixated on defending row 1) but it wins more than anything else besides YOGIC.  I'd make this play again.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: A 7E .A. +15 231
>Jim_Burlant: ?DIILRS B9 LI +10 279
#note Whiffing on SILuRID, which scores 68 at N5.  Paradoxically, this mistake probably clinched the game for me, as his next move gave me a much better play I couldn't miss.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EEHRR 2M HER +17 248
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIORS O1 D.OwSIER +122 401
#note DROSSIER and BROIDERS score 131.
