#note This ends up with Fultz having 462, and Leeds only having 371 which means that Fultz won.  The bingo "sclerid" is a mistake, CLERIDS is the correct bingo.  In the beginning Leeds gets three Ss on the rack, and has trouble getting anything decent and fishes, while Fultz comically gets to spells HEIR, YEAR, and FEAR all lined up for about 35 points each.  Overall it is a very frustrating game!

#note Keeping FIX is not right - Quackle's Championship Player suggests VIG is best on 8F, next is VIG somewhere else, and next is exchange FVGIVX, and after that is play FIX, and after that are other exchanges but not keeping FIX.

#note Oops! in case you did not notice, the correct bingo here is CLERIDS! Perhaps I was thinking of SCORIAE or SCLERAE.

#note Leeds went over by less than 1 minute so a 10 point penalty is applied, and the actual final score is 462-371.  I've attempted to enter this into the .gcg file but it doesn't work the way I am doing it.  Is there some special way that the specification is supposed to be interpreted?  When I edit it in, Quackle ignores it or decides it means it should subtract about 1000 from Fultz's score.
