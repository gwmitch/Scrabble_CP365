>Erickson_Smith: GUV 8G GUV +14 14
#note Erickson told me he usually goes by Eric, which means I played two of them in a row. Eric Kinderman was in CSW.
>JD: ?AEEENT G3 TEENA.Ed +61 61
#note this was the beginning of an improbable sequence of two games.
>Erickson_Smith: ACDEGIN 3C EDAC.ING +76 90
>Erickson_Smith: ACDEGIN --  -76 14
#note Eric looked for about 5 minutes before trying this. Nothing fits. He should probably just take the points for ACID.
>JD: INORRST H1 IRON +20 81
#note introrse won't go down through any of the 3 Es but this is pretty good.
>Erickson_Smith: ACDEGIN 4G ..CAGED +22 36
#note I like this choice for him at this point.
>JD: EERSSTU K4 .ESTURES +86 167
#note unfortunately, it didn't work out too well for him. I don't know if I would've seen UTERUSES.
>Erickson_Smith: IKMN 3L MINK +30 66
>JD: ?AFJNUY O1 Jo.Y +63 230
#note it seemed too easy for him to score through the K not to take the spot. in terms of winning percentage it really doesn't matter. Quackle gives the sim to FUN by a few points.
>Erickson_Smith: OTW J10 WOT +29 95
>JD: AADFNOU F9 FOUND +19 249
#note I thought this was a pretty reasonable defensive move here. At this point I am playing to maximize spread, and WOT suggests a pretty decent leave, I think.
>Erickson_Smith: EHIRTV 5B THRIV. +24 119
>JD: AAILMOR D4 A.MORIAL +72 321
#note I didn't spot MORAINAL. Then again, MORAINAL is the only play that can lose me the game, so maybe it's reasonable to pass it up.
>Erickson_Smith: LO 6K .OL +3 122
#note he had something good here, he told me after.
>JD: BELOPSU C5 .UB +22 343
#note it would never have occurred to me that ARMORIALS was good. that aside, no spot for PUEBLOS here - I considered trying EPIBOLUS, but HUB is fine.
>Erickson_Smith: ENORSTY 1C TYROS.NE +65 187
>JD: DELOPPS 14F SLOPPED +82 425
>Erickson_Smith: EO I8 .OE +13 200
>JD: ADEGILN N6 DEALING +74 499
>Erickson_Smith: AEFIR 15H FAIRE +56 256
>Erickson_Smith: AEFIR --  -56 200
#note I thought FAIRE* was CSW but instead it is nothing at all.
>JD: AEHIIQX 15H XI +58 557
#note improbably, I had 2 ~60 point spots for XI here. I have no idea why I failed to take IXIA for 70 - I saw it, but I miscounted and got greedy for extra spread.
>Erickson_Smith: AEFIIRW 12L FI. +14 214
>JD: ABEHIQW B2 BAI.H +52 609
#note I undercounted BAITH by 2. Quackle comes up with the superior idea here of playing QI now and saving BAITH for next turn - otherwise he gets ZA at A1 almost every time.
>Erickson_Smith: AACEIRT A6 CARATE +35 249
#note of course, this was the kind of game where I ended up getting the Z.
>JD: AEQWZ A1 ZA +37 646
>Erickson_Smith: I L12 .I. +7 256
>Erickson_Smith:  (EQW) +30 286
#note I had this as a 644, but instead I guess it was a 646 - the highest score I'd ever had at Nationals. This would remain the case for 1 round.
