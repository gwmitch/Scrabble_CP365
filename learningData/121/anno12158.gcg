>Rafi: ACNRTYZ 8D CRAZY +44 44
#note Not sure which placement is better...
>Jesse: AAEIOSW 9F WAE +29 29
>Rafi: CELNNTT -LNT +0 44
#note Thought about CLAW, but couldn't stomach the likely scenario of having to fish next turn for cheap. Maybe LENT/LYE? I think playing is better than trading here... poor exchange on my part.
>Jesse: ADEGIOS 10F AG +26 55
#note I did not spot EGAD here, but it sims about even with AG because AG bingoes 40% of the time versus the 20% after EGAD. Don't forget that EGAD takes the S!
>Rafi: CDEGNTU E10 DUG +15 59
>Jesse: DEEIORS 13D OSIERED +66 121
>Rafi: CEENSTV H11 NE.VE +27 86
>Jesse: BIILNRT 12A BRIN. +26 147
#note this was an intense game! every move really significant. fortunately my decisions early on were not that hard.
>Rafi: CDLNRST -CDLN +0 86
>Jesse: EILLNOT A12 .OLL +18 165
>Rafi: AKORSTY 11G S.ARKY +40 126
#note Didn't think of SNAKY... saw NARKY and then SNARKY. 
>Jesse: EEGINOT L11 .OGEE +20 185
#note the only option I see here which I like better than my play might be EYEING at L10 - but then again, I might as well keep the board as tight as possible while I have the lead, so I don't mind this.
>Rafi: IMOOOTT M12 MOT +22 148
#note This seems pretty ugly, not sure what's best. I did like opening an S hook though. 
>Jesse: AHIINTX D2 XANTHI. +38 223
#note I'm not crazy about throwing the board wide open, but it seemed like the best way to maximize my rack.
>Rafi: FIIOOTU C1 TOFU +35 183
>Jesse: EIPRTUW 7H WRITEUP +73 296
>Jesse: EIPRTUW --  -73 223
#note this is really bad, especially with such a good spot available (UP at B1) that he might get to use instead...after UP I am a really heavy favorite anyway (85%, says quackle). Instead, phonying here makes it a toss-up. It never crossed my mind that this wasn't a word, but when he challenged I knew right away it was no good.
>Rafi: ACIINOU B10 CO.IA +32 215
#note Huge huge huge huge blunder here. I saw this spot and played CORIA too fast, trying to put the pressure on after Jesse took some time on XANTHIC and YOGEE. CURIO is a huge improvement.
>Jesse: EIPRTUW B1 UP +34 257
#note I am very lucky that he couldn't use B1
>Rafi: IINNPTU 6B UN.IP +18 233
>Jesse: EFIIRTW 7H WIFTIER +74 331
#note well, here we go again. I definitely had to wonder for a minute if this might be phony, but ultimately you can't start chickening out of stuff at this stage.
>Rafi: DEHINTT N13 THE +28 261
#note I didn't like THEN because very few bingoes start with N, and I'm allowing Jesse to close the board too easily. T(E)ETH looks like another good option
>Jesse: ?ABJLOQ K5 QA. +24 355
#note kind of a crazy draw, but it's now going to be really hard for Rafi to catch me. Even if I can't bingo, I should be able to outrun him, even if he bingoes twice. quackle agrees with me playing QAT now saving JUT.
>Rafi: DEEILNT 2B ...ED +19 280
#note I was expecting him to play this at some point since it's about the only way he has to open a new lane in this quadrant.
>Jesse: ?BIJLOS 1A J.. +30 385
#note I bingo with almost any tile I draw here at both lanes except for drawing the V.
>Rafi: EEILNST L2 LENIT.ES +81 361
#note I might have a shot if I draw both blanks here.
>Jesse: ?BDILOS 1E BOLIDeS +84 469
#note I had to check for some miracle outplay, but he's got nothing. The only things he might have are AMARONES which I beat by 20 and MANOEUVRE as a disconnected 9 (!) on row 15 which doesn't score much.  I should play DIOBOLS so he can't play AMARONES, but I am still guaranteed a win.
