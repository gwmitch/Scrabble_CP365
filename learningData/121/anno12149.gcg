>Jim_Burlant: AADNRTU 8H UTA +6 6
#note This was the 4th game of the morning session and we had a very late start...so fatigue of a sort was setting in, which may have affected both of us.  This isn't one of the original choices, as Q prefers that I play long with TUNDRA or DAUNT and doesn't like this at all.
>Mike_Baker: EJN J6 JE.N +27 27
>Jim_Burlant: ADENORZ K4 AZON +37 43
#note Well, at least I got this right.  Just for reference, K9 plays (AZO, AZON) sim over 4 points down and win 2 - 3% less often.
>Mike_Baker: IQ L3 QI +26 53
>Jim_Burlant: DEERTUV M4 DUVET +14 57
#note Prior to his putting down the Q, I was tempted to exchange UV.  Once he put down QI,  the most important thing was, without an I in my rack, making sure that he couldn't get an easy 28 or 30 at M3. This defends against that and unloads the UV combo while doing so..  Quackle agrees:  this is best, and it's 47% to win.
>Mike_Baker: AOP 8L A.OP +21 74
>Jim_Burlant: CEIIORS -OI +0 57
#note No great options here, but the exchange was not necessary.  Q suggests I merely fish off an I with TI  I8.  INCISE 9I scores 28 and is also worth consideration.  45% to win.  Given how the subsequent fishes fail to pan out, INCISE and 10F COIRS look a whole lot better in retrospect.
>Mike_Baker: DEHLR H7 H.RLED +12 86
>Jim_Burlant: CEEGIRS N2 GIE +13 70
#note The best plays here are utterly sick:  9G C(R)I(N)GE and C(R)I(N)GES.  If you don't see them (I didn't), this is the best of the rest.  43% to win.
>Mike_Baker: INPRU 11C PURIN. +16 102
>Jim_Burlant: CEGRSTW F10 W.G +15 85
#note Or TWIG F9.  Either one is as good as the other in Quackle's eyes, and I probably should have played off the T for the extra turnover and slightly better balance.
>Mike_Baker: FIN 12B FIN +20 122
>Jim_Burlant: CEGNRST C11 ..G +12 97
#note Running on the tile treadmill, having dumped a G on 2 straight turns and gotten one back every time.  This is way too fishy - I should have just looked to score with 13A NEG, but at the time my thought process was that, if I'd managed to draw a single vowel I'd bingo.  This sims way down the list, but in reality that's misleading:  everything wins within 2% and sims within 3 or 4 ponts of the best play.  
>Mike_Baker: ?ACINRT N7 R.mANTIC +74 196
#note While this maximizes score,  Mike couldn't think of the better bingo that was available:  TORNADIC also plays at N7 and doesn't give back the S hook on the triple line.  This was crucial to how the game panned out.
>Jim_Burlant: CEKNRST 13M K.N +14 111
#note Surprisingly, this is one of my top 3 options; L7 plays like TACKER or TANKER do well statically but bomb in the sim.  Q says I should simply fish off the N with N2 GEN or the T with F9 TWIG..  11% to win, but I'm about to catch a huge break.
>Mike_Baker: EIIOSSY -EIIO +0 196
#note This was Mike's actual rack.  He took a long time on this position before opting to exchange 4; at the time the OIIS leave of YES frightened him.  In this position, terrible leave or not, my own play probably would have been SI 15N to take out the S hook.    Instead, watch how this turns the game around.  Post-mortem, he realized that this was where he lost the game.
>Jim_Burlant: CELORST 15H COLTERS +90 201
#note COSTREL plays at 14A and this or LECTORS play at G1, but because he left row 15 open, this has now let me back in the game.  If he had played SI on the previous turn, I'd have scored 79 with COSTREL 14A and he'd have an almost certain 30 coming back on row 15 and I'd be trailing by somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 points after his comeback.
>Mike_Baker: AEMX K9 EXAM +28 224
>Jim_Burlant: AAADLMW L11 AMA +32 233
#note Well, that worked out nicely.  This is best, and the game is now a tossup:  47% to win.
>Mike_Baker: EISV 14A VISE +21 245
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILOW O1 WO +18 251
#note Best - other options include O8 POW and G11 NOW.  41% to win.  But my next rack is going to increase that quite substantially.
>Mike_Baker: EEF 15D FEE +19 264
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEILY G1 DIALYsE +68 319
#note I thought it was now or never, but I was wrong.  Bingoing is not best here; A13 IVY should have been the play.  
>Mike_Baker: OOT 4D TOO. +8 272
>Jim_Burlant: BHIRSUY 1D YIR.S +39 358
#note Chickened out on HURDS and BURDS, so I settled on this, as I didn't want to empty the bag with HYBRIDS.  This had another benefit:
>Mike_Baker: BEELORS -  +0 272
#note This was a desperation challenge; he knew he couldn't win if this was good.
