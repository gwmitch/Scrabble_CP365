>Jim_Burlant: FIORRUV 8G FOUR +14 14
#note Somehow didn't see FUROR.  FUROR 8D should have been the play, but I benefit from this mistake.
>Jon_Shreve: AMRY J6 MA.RY +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: EEILRSV H8 .VERLIES +86 100
#note Wondered if I should take the points with this or play at K2.  Q says that it's stylistic preference - this, LEVIERS K2, and VEILERS K2 sim interchangeably; either is as good as the other.  I felt that this early, I should take the points.
>Jon_Shreve: IQ K5 QI +26 50
>Jim_Burlant: AAAIJLO 11E AJA. +22 122
#note JAIL L3 scores 38. In the "sad, but true" category, I was so blinded by the triplicated A's that I didn't even see it.  Again, this worked out.
>Jon_Shreve: CGILO L2 LOGIC +34 84
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEILO 2H OEIL.AdE +68 190
#note It doesn't get much luckier than fishing EE? to AILO and having him float an L.  This is the only bingo and best play.  86% to win.
>Jon_Shreve: EGY 1F GEY +36 120
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIINT 1N IF +31 221
#note The only 8 in this rack is ANTILIFE, and it doesn't play.  This is best.  92% to win.
>Jon_Shreve: EM I6 EM. +23 143
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINTU 15A UNITAGE. +80 301
#note This and SAUTEING both score 80, but this is better for two reasons.  First, Jon will bingo slightly less often against this than against SAUTEING.  Secondly, vowel placement:  XIIIUU are unseen, and SAUTEING gives him a potential XI or XU for 52 on row 14.  This wins the sim at 98.8%.
>Jon_Shreve: AEHNN 12A HENNA +26 169
>Jim_Burlant: BCDLPPV M1 D.P +27 328
#note Making lemonade from lemons.  I can't defend any of the lines he's opened up, and I can't turn this rack.   However, I *can* score 27 and unload a duplicated P.  27 points is enough to justify playing through this drek.  This and B(E)V(Y) 10G are the only scoring plays worth making - the rest of the options are deep exchanges.  This is best, winning 98%.
>Jon_Shreve: IX 14A XI +31 200
>Jim_Burlant: BCLPTUV A8 BUTC. +36 364
#note Everything wins 99.5% or thereabouts by now, so I'm only playing for equity.  Nothing else scores more than 20; this choice's 36 points make this the clear best play.
>Jon_Shreve: DDR 14G R.DD +12 212
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEHLPV B6 VEEP +25 389
#note  Now that I'm sitting on the blank, it's all but certain he can't win this game.  But I want to maximize my spread, and the way to do that is to take away his easiest lines.  This is best, and everything has now crossed the line from 99.xx% to 100% winning chances.
>Jon_Shreve: NOOSST O1 ..STOONS +36 248
>Jim_Burlant: ?AHLORT N6 LOATHeR +77 466
#note Best bingo - other bingo options are 3B and N8 ALTHORn.
>Jon_Shreve: EKZ 12L ZE.K +44 292
>Jim_Burlant: ADINOSW O12 .OI +7 473
#note Looking at the pool, I saw that he potentially had TABORIN and/or WAITRON on row 3. I figured that if I blocked those with something like WINO 2C, he'd have come back with KNOB or KNOW O12 for 30 or 33.   Since I was sitting on the case S, I thought I should set myself up for a row 15 play to counter his impending bingo.  Yes, the game was won but I was trying to maximize spread.  This isn't even one of the original kibbitzer options but it sims with better valuation than any of the other choices.
