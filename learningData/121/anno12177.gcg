#note VARIA must be better.  I know David Whitley is a very good player since I have seen his Jumbletime scores and they ROCK.

#note Well DUH, I should have challenged it since it is PHONY.  I just thought I had seen it before - doesn't mean it's good.  It looks ridiculous, so I am a fool not to challenge it.  In penance David taught me an anamonic for 'eel skin'.  It makes an 8 with each letter in TOGS.  Eelskin togs.  I really should know it since 'eel skin' is obviously letters from my name.

#note Very faulty of me not to challenge the phony hook VIRAL+S.  Actually I held it because I had 'acetase' on my mind, which is CASEATE of course.  Life is rough in the big city.  Here my rack was just bad, not certain exactly what I had but this is close - APRON is better if that's what I had. And trying really hard to fish for a bingo, I forgot all about CORN hooks besides S.
