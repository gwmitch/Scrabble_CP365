#note Interesting. This play sims fine, but another option is to keep the high-pointers (FK) to keep scoring next turn. The F is actually pretty strong here. Ex. 6 keeping F sims best, but all trades sim close.

#note This was the tough position of the game. Win had caught up and might even be bingo prone. I had the option to try to score with my big tiles, or fish for a bingo. I considered setting up my S with HANG or PHAGE on row 3, but that could be disastrous if Win has the other one. In the end, I decided to fish. Five I's unseen makes this leav seem pretty strong. Quackle likes 3K HANG, but I was right to be nervous about such plays. Win did have the S.

#note Missing JINGLERS was idiotic and could have really cost me if Win had a bingo. Other mistakes were relatively small
