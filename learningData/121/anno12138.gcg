>Carl_Johnson: AJW 8G JAW +26 26
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADFLNPS J4 FLAPS +26 26
#note Or FAD 7H.
>Carl_Johnson: AEUV 4J .AUVE +22 48
#note UVEA K2 might ask for a cheapshot, yet scores an extra point.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DDINORU 9C DURION +22 48
#note Didn't spot UND(E)RDO N1 26. I kind of like my play better.
>Carl_Johnson: AAEINST E4 SANTE.IA +82 130
#note Or also E5 SEAT(R)AIN.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEGISW N1 EDG.WISE +80 128
#note So WEDGIES popped out first, but then I noticed EDG(E)WISE...EDGEWISE created a lot of volatility and potential while sacrificing the two points. It turns out that Carl had MO(V)IEOLA ready to roll at M2, and the S in WEDGIES wouldn't have blocked, but rather added two points to his bingo. EDGEWISE has some logic.
>Carl_Johnson: MOO O1 MOO +33 163
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEEIIY 5H EE.Y +24 152
#note Perhaps one of the worst draws I could pull after the bingo. I can't utilize O8 effectively, so I'm forced to concede the hot spot. Quackle thinks EE(L)Y is best also.
>Carl_Johnson: ?AEIILM O8 MILIA +36 199
#note So Carl mentioned after the game that he forwent on some bingos, since he scores well while retaining E?. Quackle identifies with this thinking to an extent, but prefers rAMILIE O8, MILE(S)IAn 4A, I(D)EALIsM C8 etc.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEEIIN D1 AEDINE +24 176
#note Yeah, I should've played ANI(S)EED 4B, but I wasn't that clever. Carl held, perhaps only realise his atom bomb.
>Carl_Johnson: ?CEGHNT 1A CHE.TiNG +167 366
#note KBOOOM.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EFIINPT M8 FINITE +28 204
#note N(E)IF 2C looks best by a long shot, and I would've played it had I seen it. This is the runner-up.
>Carl_Johnson: KNOR 8A KRON. +36 402
>Gunther_Jacobi: AOPTTYZ D11 TOPAZ +54 258
>Carl_Johnson: BGO C12 GOB +27 429
>Gunther_Jacobi: BHLTTXY 12K LY.T. +16 274
#note SHEESH! TH(I)STLY 4B 26!
>Carl_Johnson: EU B1 .UE +12 441
>Gunther_Jacobi: BHRSTUX F11 BRUX +34 308
#note Yeah, BRUSH 14J might score more, but I wanted to hold my S in case I draw into a miracle bingo through M14.
>Carl_Johnson: LV 3A V.L. +16 457
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADHORST B13 HOD +32 340
#note That unseen E would've helped! (K)ATHODES A8! HOD is best...If I should pick the Q, QATS will find a home.
>Carl_Johnson: ?EIOQRR 15A a.O.E +49 506
#note Carl apparently mistracked here, thinking I had two T's instead of the A, thus missing my out. Quackle likes QuI(N)O(L) 10J 36, but QI J13 is a killer, blocking my out. The other cool thing about QI is that it maintains A(D)O(Z)E 49 next play. I'm starting to realise, GOOD plays, have MORE than ONE purpose! If Carl had me tracked, he told me he'd have played QI instantly.
