>Jason_Keller: AHMOW 8D WHAMO +34 34
#note this was a huge game! if I won I would've completed a 7-0 day 4.
>JD: FMNOQRR 9B FROM +22 22
#note this sets up QI which is nice
>Jason_Keller: CDEHIL B9 .ILCHED +36 70
>JD: DGNOQRY 10A Q. +11 33
#note I'm already not in great shape, but it seemed that the Q needed to go before I could accomplish anything else. Even if I draw QI or QAT I have nowhere great to play. If I draw a U I get QUA, but then again this way I might draw HYDROGEN

>JD: EGINNRV H7 ..VING +12 69
#note unfortunately, he just blocked VIGNERON. I didn't want to just start fishing repeatedly with EGINR or EGINRV, and on a tight board an exchange didn't look that good. quackle doesn't love it but I'm fine with my play.

#note there we go
>Jason_Keller: EJNO 6D JEON +27 162
>JD: ?CEOTTT K2 TOTE. +16 165
#note nowhere for octette - it seemed best to score and open some new lane.
>Jason_Keller: AERZ 10F ZA.RE +36 198
#note he faked like he was about to play ZAR at L1 and I almost lost it!

>Jason_Keller: APY O1 PA.Y +45 243
>JD: AAIIOOS C12 OI +22 259
#note yuck! ugly letters. AVISO is a nice way to plough through some extra letters that I didn't spot.
>Jason_Keller: EIW 8L .IEW +30 273
>JD: AAINOSX 10L .AX +26 285
#note axion looks might dangerous here. I figured instead I would block the remaining lanes on the board and see what happens. given his last few plays, it's hard for me to believe he hasn't at least picked up an S by now. I'm fine with LAX.
>Jason_Keller: DEO H1 DO.E +21 294
>JD: AIINORS 11F AI. +16 301
#note DRAIN is definitely better instead of AIN! just missed it. I thought about sacrificing 6 points to play OI but it seemed like too many - but I think in retrospect that would've been a better choice because AINRS is so much more bingo-prone.
>Jason_Keller: ABEERTT -ABE +0 294
#note he was not pleased. I think he tossed in 3 Us.
>JD: AEINORS 12H .O +3 304
#note oh christ! I missed ANEROIDS here. wow. at least it doesn't immediately cost me the game. Maybe it was the time pressure.
>Jason_Keller: EL 11K L.E +8 302
>JD: ABEINRS 2N B. +14 318
#note even though I missed getting to score here is nice.
>Jason_Keller: SU N5 US +15 317

>Jason_Keller: EGNRSTU 4D GURN.T +16 333
#note wow. I mistracked and thought he had GRUNTLES to lose by 1. Crazy that he didn't have the blank!
>JD: ?APT E12 sPAT +13 411
#note TePA is 2 extra
