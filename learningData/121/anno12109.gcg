#note Kept an S and opening up an S hook.
This can also be done for other hook letters, not only S, but S is the most powerful probably. 
Since I know I have an S, the probability I have an S is one, and since I don't know whether Paula has an S, the probability Paula has an S is less than one.  So the hook is more likely to benefit me instead of Paula, as far as I know.
I probably kept some 1-pointers along with the S to try to draw a bingo.

#note We counted it as 32 instead of 36.  For the final score it should have been 500 on my side but we ended up recording it as 500.  
You see here that I am using my S, since my tiles were no fun right then and I wanted to score some points, and it seemed likely I would soon draw another S or a blank.  That may not be the best logic.  Unfortunately I forget what my rack was so I can't check it this time.

#note There's also vETIVER for 88 points, or RESTIVE hooking TAUT for 88 also, but that opens more dangerous spots.  So does this, for example QU(E)EN could go down, but that's not too likely really.

#note This is also pretty ridiculous! 
I should win by a lot!

>Kevin_Leeds: EEIINRT N2 NITERIE +70 250
#note NITERY is another spelling of it.  I hesitated thinking maybe this wasn't really a word but then I decided it was fine.

>Kevin_Leeds: ?IMORST 2A TRISOMe +79 360
#note TRISOME turned out to be a fatal mistake as Paula got unusually lucky the next turn!  

According to Quackle's estimate here, if I play TRISOME here, it's the best for winning percentage, and I'll win over 99.5% of the time, or lose only once in 200.  Unfortunately this triple-triple lane is about to really sting

#note Ideally I would know STICKLE clearly enough to not challenge it and lose my turn even if it is a 200+ point bingo

#note Wild game.  Ended up winning $25 for Paula (high word) and $25 for me (high loss in division 2 for the tournament.  Not the prize I was intending to win.)

For the rest of the tournament I kept trying to remind myself:
Do what it takes to win.  Not what it takes to score 10 more points.  Not what it takes to make a funny word ....
