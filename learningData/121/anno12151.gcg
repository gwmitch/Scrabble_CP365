>Scott_Leifer: AAEGGRR 8D GARAGER +72 72
>Jim_Burlant: DEELLOY F1 YODELLE. +66 66
#note I held GARAGER* and didn't like it...but chickened out on challenging it.  When I saw what it gave me back, I felt that I could have my cake and eat it too by trading bingos and not taking the chance on losing the turn. In reality, I missed a chance for some good gamesmanship.  What I should have done was challenge this off.  After that, knowing that he was going to put down the R I needed, I should have transposed tiles (e.g.:  YDOLE*) to ensure he challenged my play off.  He'd follow that up with RAG or RAGG, and I'd reply with YODELLER.  Instead, I chickened out.  Anyway...as for this choice, this plays at F1 and J1, and both score 66 points.  I chose this because I thought this would make it harder for Scott to bingo, and Quackle agrees.    Though it was obviously a mistake on my part to let his phony go, this turned the game into quite the donnybrook.
>Scott_Leifer: IN 1F .IN +18 90
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALMNOR 2H ALMONeR +80 146
#note Considered this and NORMALs K2.  Thing is, I wasn't sure whether he knew GARAGER was phony or if he was laying a trap for me, and I didn't want to take the chance of finding out the hard way.  As for this play:  ALMONRy also scores 80 and is slightly better.  The only bingo on row 5 is NORMALLy, wihch only scores 68 to this play's 80.  I'm 68% to win, but not for long.
>Scott_Leifer: DEGIRSU 5E S.UDGIER +90 180
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEEIT 3B CEBI. +20 166
#note I'd expected him to take out O1, and I'd planned to bingo back with CELIBATE on row 5.  I don't know how I missed ABET 1L, but I did.  That should have been the play, and this is as good as the rest of the optiions.  Frankly, I'm surprised this doesn't sim worse than it does.  
>Scott_Leifer: ?IMNOSY B3 .rONYISM +72 252
#note Nice find!!  That said, thankfully for me he missed much better choices:  ISONoMY scores 95 at O1, cRONYISM scores 82 at L4, and the best play, SYMBION, scores 101 at O2.  
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEKNT A8 KEA +45 211
#note Strong play, but not best - AKEE scores 53.  
>Scott_Leifer: AOVW 4L AVOW +32 284
>Jim_Burlant: AAEJNTZ C10 AZAN +31 242
#note I saw potential J plays and thought that if I could turn 4 tiles and score 31 whle doing so, the J was my real threat to score on the next turn.  Q doesn't like this at all, saying I should play 6L TAJ for 29.  
>Scott_Leifer: AEIV O4 .AIVE +33 317
>Jim_Burlant: EEHIJTT D1 JI.E +42 284
#note Q didn't like my last play, but it loves this.  This is best, though I'm still only 15% to win.
>Scott_Leifer: DE 11C .ED +26 343
>Jim_Burlant: DEHQTTU 12A QU.TE +55 339
#note Obviously a toss-up between this and QUAD.  While this burns my E, the tile pool, with its 4 unseen T's swayed me:  with 2 T's in my rack and T being the most probable draw, I reluctantly unloaded my E (not something I wanted to do with only 2 remaining) in order to unload one of my T's, lest I wind up with 4 T's in my next rack.  Quackle agrees with me.  This is best, winning 29%.  While I was on an even footing, scorewise, the unseen pool made me realize I was in a footrace to see who could beat the other to extending the Q.  This game was nowhere near being decided.
>Scott_Leifer: FOT 6I OFT +32 375
>Jim_Burlant: DEFHRTU 7E F.H +27 366
#note Arrgh!  So close, yet so far.  What I needed was one of the 3 I's in the bag - one of the two most probable tiles remaining, and I missed it.  Anyway - with the Q extensions being available, I was not playing off my U.  Q says it's either this or G7 HAFT, with slight preference given to HAFT.  Given the tile pool, that looks right.  And turning the extra tile is critical if I can get an I so I can play QUID on the next turn.  38% to win, but that percentage is about to go down.
>Scott_Leifer: IPU A12 .UIP +45 420
#note So much for my plan.  And now I'm in trouble.
>Jim_Burlant: DENRTTU 1J UT +8 374
#note FAIL.  Had seen potential plays like JETON 1K when I had the J, but I needed to look harder for a longer play here.  Best is apparently 1K TUNED 29, but his last play of QUIP pretty much sealed my fate - if I don't get a bingo or the X, I'm hosed.  TUNED wins 12%; this wins 6%.  
>Scott_Leifer: OX 9H OX +37 457
>Jim_Burlant: DELNRRT -DLR +0 374
#note While I've misplayed these last 2 racks, even best play only wins 2.8%.  I didn't see how G7 HALT was going to help me, and floating the E wth HALTER seemed reckless.  This worked, but only in the sense of saving spread.  
>Scott_Leifer: CHIW N8 WICH +23 480
>Jim_Burlant: EINORST 15A .OINTERS +83 457
#note Supposedly I should skip the bingo, but I'm not sure how that wins more often.  Q says 9D ONS is best.
