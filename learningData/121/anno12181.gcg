#note Overlooked CODEIAS since it looks sort of plural already! Oops.  So, see, I've gone over 4 vowel 7s before, using cardbox, but apparently that isn't the only method we need.

#note Challenged BRAZEN because I thought it was a mere adjective.  It is a verb all on its own. I learned that once but the recollection wasn't clear

#note I'm thinking I had a P in the rack also, and then I missed PE(A)VY on 3F

#note It could have been PIEBALDS too this way!  There was a discussion in Thai after this and I attempted to overhear it, and I told them it was like Pachenko, which is completely retarded.  I am from Indianapolis and I only know the songs that used to be played on WNDE a long time ago.  I am not from Thailand whatsoever.  Thailand is very far away!  I was lucky to get two blanks this game.  I loved the rack because ALPINE is one of my favorite stems.  Even so, I missed many great bingos to CODEIAS.
