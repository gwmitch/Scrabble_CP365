>David: AAEGILY 8G YAGI +16 16
#note This is the annotated game at Table 1 of Round 27 of the 2012 NSC. Any commentary added is mine (Jesse's).
>Jesse: AMORSTU 7F UM +17 17
#note kinda shocking that nothing plays. Especially at table 1 these are nerve-racking positions.
>David: AEEIILW E4 WAIL +19 35
#note huge miss of WEIGELIA for david here!!
>Jesse: ALORRST K6 ROSTRAL +73 90
>David: AEEEIOY 4C YO.IE +22 57
>Jesse: ?BCEIWZ 3G WIZ +38 128
#note little did I imagine that I was missing a bingo of my own on this turn...I definitely know ZWIEBACK but it didn't occur to me to look. I would've played that for sure had I seen it.
>David: ACEEEPS 2A ESCAPEE +82 139
>Jesse: ?BCEEHU L1 BoUCHEE +86 214
>David: EIKNRRU 12G KNUR.IER +76 215
#note david's still right there
>Jesse: ADDGNTX 6D N.X +51 265
>David: EIJNNPQ A1 J.EP +48 263
>Jesse: ADDGORT M8 GOAD.D +20 285
#note tough play. quackle suggests that playing long doesn't change my bingo percentages much, so I should likely just take the points. especially since gibson is unlikely to open a new lane at random.
>David: HINNQST 3K Q.INT +28 291
>Jesse: AFLNORT N6 FRONT +27 312
#note this looks dangerous, but in actuality there are not a lot of tiles that score a lot at this spot. NONFAT or FONTAL are the other suggested plays that quackle comes up with, but I thought I might be able to trigger a defensive reaction out of gibson here if he thought I was setting myself up. ultimately though my play sims better because it keeps his bingo percentage much lower - 9% instead of 21% after FONTAL or NONFAT, both of which would give him two nice letters to bingo through.
>David: ?DEHNSU 13H UH +20 311
>Jesse: AEELNTV 10D LEVANTE. +71 383
>David: ?ADENSV 14B iNVADES +81 392
>Jesse: DEFIOOO O8 DOE +33 416
#note I am not a favorite to win this game at this point. FOLIO is my other option here, especially because he can't use the right side unless he has the last O, but I think I have to take the points.
>David: AGIIMOS 1L .IOG +21 413
#note as david realized later himself, emptying the bag here probably cost him the game since I had enough time to plan a nice endgame. I think his best bet is likely a play like OI at M5, leaving himself the WAILS hook for a big play next turn, or maybe even something like GAMBIRS.
>Jesse: AFIOORT D8 FO.IO +24 440
#note I had FOLIO in mind even when I played DOE, but I'm ashamed to say that I didn't even see the biggest threat of WAILS here even as I planned my endgame. Luckily for me this was pretty clearly about as good as I could do - although FOLIA followed by TORI or ROTI is better by a point.
>David: ABILMST 8A ALI.S +32 445
#note his best play
