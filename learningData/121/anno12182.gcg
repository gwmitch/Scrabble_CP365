#note That A hook came as a surprise since I forgot to look for hooks at both ends of the words.  Like, I only deal with S hooks usually.  Later in the tournament I have two As and play VAST around C2 to make a nice unblockable threat that helps me out, so that is cool.  We learn one way or another.

>Kevin_Leeds: EGHINRW 4A WHINGER +90 158
#note I have some confused memories about WHINGE and WHINGER and whether they're valid.   WHINGE is a verb, it's not very hard to keep it straight.  Maybe I lost a challenge on a phony hook once? or played it and someone challenged it and lost the challenge?
>Tony_Claitor: FIP -  +0 125
#note There was a very quick challenge here.  I chuckled some and said 'instachallenge!' because I thought it meant it was going to be wrong.  It is right though! It was just a case of someone else making a mistake for a change!

#note Nice play and now the board gets very tacky to deal with! Not many places to bingo, and I really want to find a bingo.  It takes patience to deal with these and this time I decided I'm going to be patient if that's what it takes. Meanwhile Tony's looking at his watch and telling me he's late, his ride is waiting for him.  So i decided after the game I would try to fill out the result slip quickly instead of dawdling.

#note Played TOLlING and counted it wrong, should have been 76 not 78 so add 2 to my score here.  Ther's a 78 point bingo TI?LONS that I didn't see. Call our 1-800 number to find out what the ? is!

#note We also scored EYER as 27 instead of 28 so the score we agreed to was 396-427.  Tony talked to me afterwards about the game in the same helpful, friendly, learning-together spirit that I hope to carry.  Also, this board is gnarly-looking.
