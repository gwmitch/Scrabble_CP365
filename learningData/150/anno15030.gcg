>Matthew_Larocque: ACENORV 8D CRAVEN +28 28
#note Oh, I guess CARVEN would be best defensively.
>Danny_Panganiban: ERWY F6 WE.RY +27 27
#note Setup
>Matthew_Larocque: EHOOSUU 10F .OU +6 34
#note This looks pretty horrible, but HOUSE seemed like a better leave than it looked. I was just crossing my fingers that Danny didn't draw a huge bingo with an A. Sim also likes  U(N)HOUSE - I didn't even know the word. 
>Danny_Panganiban: ABEMR D8 .AMBER +24 51
#note Hm, Danny doesn't know the hook? Or maybe he just forgot about it? BREAM is 30, although even better is (U)MBRAE for 39.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHIOSTU E11 OH +23 57
#note Yikes, I've been missing so many out- bingos lately, I don't get it. I always look for them. Was debating HOU(R)/I as well, but wanted to leave the board as S-hook friendly as possible.
>Danny_Panganiban: ETTX 11H TEXT +24 75
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGISTU 5F AUGITES +78 135
>Danny_Panganiban: IQ 4I QI +24 99
#note So Danny knew it and just forgot.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDNNSZ J3 D..Z +34 169
#note Seemed like a better bet than ZA - which leaves me with no vowels and him with a chance for huge points.
>Danny_Panganiban: AOP C11 APO +27 126
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACNNST L1 CANT. +20 189
#note Probably should have at least found CoNS(T)ANT. Didn't know STANNiC, but NASCeNT rang a bell - I have seen it before but it's been a looong time and I've never actually played it before. I assumed I was missing something so this felt like a weak play.
>Danny_Panganiban: NRU 1L .URN +18 144
>Matthew_Larocque: ?JNOOSW L8 JOWS +34 223
#note And my punishment for breaking up the rack is drawing JOOW. But at least it scores points. I didn't know DONJON.
>Danny_Panganiban: INO 8L .OIN +33 177
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDEFNO N8 .NFOlDED +90 313
#note But sometimes making errors leads to ridiculous plays like this.
>Danny_Panganiban: AKPR -  +0 177
#note Truthfully I wasn't 100% on the play, thought there was a slight chance INFOLD was a noun.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHILST 14D SHELTIE +77 390
#note Most players would have probably played this in like 20 seconds, but it seriously took me several minutes before I saw it, and even then it was a vague "I think I've seen this word but I don't have a clue what it means" type of feeling. At least I'm trusting my gut more..... oh except next game I revert back to my old habits.
>Danny_Panganiban: AKPR 13I PARK +22 199
#note Danny ain't afraid of no E, apparently.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGILMOO M13 EM +38 428
>Danny_Panganiban: EIV 6C VIE. +10 209
>Matthew_Larocque: BGILLOO O14 GO +24 452
#note At this point I just make whatever plays I find that score more than 10 points, to finish the game. Sim likes 15E OLIO by far. 
>Danny_Panganiban: DFNU D2 FUND. +18 227
>Matthew_Larocque: BIILLOS 3C B.LL +12 464
#note Don't have a clue, literally nothing scores. I like BILLIO(N), but sim likes (F)ILO or (F)OIL. Forgot to consider that there is already a TWS open below.
>Danny_Panganiban: AY 7J YA +23 250
#note AY instead, Danny :P
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIIOS 15H AG +21 485
#note Yeah I guess AI or OI instead but not really a big deal.
>Danny_Panganiban: ?AEIILR O6 LI.EAR +15 265
#note Danny mentions that he almost had cOLI(N)EAR, but seems like he missed bILI(N)EAR!
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIOST N1 .IOTS +10 495
#note There's like 8 better plays than this, the best being TO(T)E(R)S 24. I'm curious how well I can play endgames if I actually have adequate time when I get to it haha.
