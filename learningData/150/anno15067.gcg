#note Ouch. I haven't looked at the list of 4s that don't take an ess in a long time, and I clearly need to review it before Denver.

#note Oh, but this was a hard decision, and in the end I choked. I wanted to play SORE or SIRE to block that L and E, the only open lines, but I was worried about the AEI or AEO leaves. I spent so much time thinking about that that when I finally decided that OY would restrict his bingo to endiing in T, or to make the blank an ess, I forgot about the N hook, AND the parallel play. Total choke, but hopefully I can avoid that in Denver.

Quackle hates SIRE or SORE BTW, but letting Joel bingo loses, so the block HAD to be the right play.
