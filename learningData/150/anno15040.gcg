>Winter: DKLRSUW -LURKWD +0 0
#note Because they moved the starting time from 9:10 toI started with aout 8:40, not 13:40 like I had expected. With an extra 5 minutes, I might find LURK, but I quickly decided I was too low to fuck around with bad tiles.
>Orlet_Bullock: AEFLNU 8D FLAUNE +26 26
>Winter: EIMNOST J6 MESTINO +77 77
#note Exactly what I needed.
>Orlet_Bullock: ?DEIOPR 11E PROIg.ED +90 116
#note NOT what I needed. 
>Winter: EGIIIJOU F6 JI.O +27 104
>Orlet_Bullock: FISTX H10 F.XITS +72 188
#note  This doesn't take an ess???	
>Winter: EGILMRU K3 GLUM +20 124
#note Dang, played this one too quickly, gave up points. Anyway, GLUM kinda describes how Orlet was about to look.
>Orlet_Bullock: BDEELOU 14F OU.BLEED +65 253
>Orlet_Bullock: BDEELOU --  -65 188
#note No way dude. Probably confusing it with OUTBREED.
>Winter: EIIRRST 3I RI. +5 129
#note With more time, I MIGHT have taken the 11 points for R(E)I, but with my clock so low I didn't even look. Just fished for the bingo, not even realizing he could just play the B there.
>Orlet_Bullock: BDEELOU 14B DOUBLE. +24 212
#note Once I turned the board around, I realized he had the B, and I WILLED Orlet to miss the hook.
>Winter: EEIRSTY H1 YETI +29 158
>Orlet_Bullock: AITV L11 .AVIT +20 232
>Winter: AEGKRST 2F GR.EK +42 200
#note Getting some good breaks, easy stuff to see.
>Orlet_Bullock: AEHOV 12A HOVEA +34 266
#note Orlet got me on this one, the extra 5.
>Winter: ?AAESTZ 14J ZA.rE +66 266
#note I didn't exactly have time to think about it much, but this one was a hard decision. Just play ZA, or play to catch up. I quickly decided that, the way Orlet was playing, the psychological impact of having me nearly catch up would put even more pressure on him.
>Orlet_Bullock: ADNW 15A DAWN +38 304
#note I did not love this.

Let me be clear, Winter loves you, but he doesn't love this play.
>Winter: ABEESTW O12 WEST +47 313
#note Aight, now IT'S ON, MOFO!!!
>Orlet_Bullock: Q 4G Q. +11 315
#note Loved this
>Winter: ABEELNS 7I B.E +23 336
#note Sigh. If only PROIGNED had been something else, that took the ess. Regardless, I'm feeling pretty good. Orlet is now low on time, so it is in my interest to make short plays and prolong the game.
>Orlet_Bullock: AR 13L .AR. +18 333
>Winter: AEGLNOS A7 GALOS.E +33 369
#note Another no-go. I actually know ENGAOLS.
>Orlet_Bullock: NNO B8 NON +13 346
>Winter: AINORUY C9 YO +22 391
#note Feeling pretty good. Orlet has less time than me now, and is visibly nervous. No way he pulls this out.
>Orlet_Bullock: AEHPRT 1A TEPHRA +48 394
#note OH SHIT!!!
>Winter: ACDINRU C1 .URANIC +28 419
#note Oh wow. Not only did Orlet's play catch me by surprise, but I found myself with my third no-go of the game, and I did not see any obvious ways to play the C and D and score enough to win (didn't see CNIDA). The only other thing that wins is (P)UDIC, but ONLY if Orlet freaks out and doesn't play (C)ID to tie.

Fortunately I was able to pull (P)URANIC out of some deep dark recess of my mind. I wasn't sure, but I was out of time, and I'm not sure I see CNIDA.
