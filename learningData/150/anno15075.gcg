#note One thing I don't like about playing live games is once you put the tiles down, your opponent knows what you have.  I flashed the F so basically I have to play it.  Had I thought a little bit longer.  AVA would have been a nice setup.  Wonder if he would have blocked.

#note Really wish I had not flashed my F...might have been able to set something up nice.  Maybe play just AVA...
