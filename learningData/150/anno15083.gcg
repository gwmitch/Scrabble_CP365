#note ICEMAN is 42. 
>Adam_Ginzberg: NTU O8 .TUN +15 85
#note I'm pretty sure Adam's holding an S with this play. I play him a lot, so I'm making a lot of inferences this game.

>Matt_Canik: ACEENOP E7 PON.E +18 112
#note One of the hardest turns of the tournament for me. I'm guessing he's more than likely bingo-friendly right now, so I don't want to play COPE. This makes it hard for him to hit a MEWLERS bingo and keeps counter-bingos along F low-scoring and counterable. 
>Adam_Ginzberg: FO J5 FO. +15 122
>Matt_Canik: ADELLOP D6 POL +13 125
#note After CRAY, I started doubting myself on words and pussied out on PONCED. This is not good.

>Matt_Canik: ABCDELN 13C CANDLE +22 147
#note I don't even know what I'm doing, I just tried to fork and draw some new tiles so I could score some points.

>Matt_Canik: ?ANORTT 2I ARNaTTO +68 310
#note This game is going to come down to who draws the Q.

ATTORNs is better defensively, but this leaves me chances to cash the H if I draw HQ. 
>Adam_Ginzberg: AGIIOSU I4 AI +7 311
#note Adam runs his clock down to 0:40 here before making this play. Q says three plays win: (ZA)G, AGIO 3K, and (TA)U for 4. 
>Matt_Canik: EHIMNQV L1 M.VIN +24 334
#note Adam now very quickly has to decide if he should block my Q and goes with his gut...

>Matt_Canik: EHQ 1N EH +32 366
>Adam_Ginzberg: GIOU 5E ..G +13 326
#note ...but he has 13 seconds to play 4 tiles and I'm passing as fast as I can.
