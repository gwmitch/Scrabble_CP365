#note Wow. This was crazy, a rare situation where I might have been better off not challenging. I saw AMB(A)RIES, but obviously that gives up a lot. But I made a huge mistake, in not working out my play before I challenged. Once the word came up off the board, things got tricky.
>Winter: ABEIMRS 7C BAM +19 92
#note What I would have seen, had I looked for it, was the possible triple-triple, SC(A)PULAE, that Jean could play if I played AMBRIES. I wasn't sure if it was good, but I couldn't risk that she would see and try it. I might have been better off just letting her phoney stand, so I could play AMB(A)RIES and take my chances with her counterplay, because as it stands, I know my play of BAM will let her extend her lead, on a tight board (if I don't draw into a bingo with EIRS).

>Winter: DEINRRS 10C DINER +18 110
#note Quackle loves DR(AB), but on a tight board like this, I did not want to give up points by fishing for a bingo. If she gets that spot, I'm kinda screwed (because I don't know SCAW).

>Winter: DEGOQRS -DGOQ +0 110
#note Uh-oh.
>Jean_McArthur: AILU C10 .ULIA +12 145
#note Crap. Can't remember if this takes an ess. I'm trying to outthink Jean, but I don't really know her skill level. I would not have played SEW if I didn't have an other ess, which means she might have one, but this could also be a trap.  Based on my earlier coffeehousing, she can probably infer I have an ess.
>Winter: AEOORSU 11E OU +14 124
#note Lovely exchange.
>Jean_McArthur: ETTY B11 YETT +27 172
>Winter: ADEKORS D12 KED +37 161
#note Oy!!! I don't think I've EVER noticed the K hook for YU. The A, yes, but not the K. Dropped a lot of equity here.

>Jean_McArthur: EGI H1 GIE +17 232
>Winter: ACEEHJZ 14F ZA +64 268
#note Okay, this might work out after all.

>Jean_McArthur: EGINSTT 13G TESTING +74 306
#note Or not.
>Winter: BCDEEHJ 6I JEED +36 304
#note Agonized over this play. JEED nearly catches me up, but the bag is light on vowels. With BCH, just one vowel will allow me to score, but if I draw the Q...
>Jean_McArthur: RUU 1H .URU +5 311
#note You have to laugh. You'll see why in a second.
>Winter: AABCHQV I3 HA +22 326
#note Wow. The Q. After I dumped 2 Us AND Jean drew them. I'm not just going to lose the game, but the tournament too (needed to keep it within 50-60 I think).

>Jean_McArthur: ?AEGILS O8 .EALInGS +80 391
#note Yeah, I saw that comin. If I'd just ducked the Q.

#note Okay, this was my bad. I lost the tournament by 2 spread points, which I could have had right here.
