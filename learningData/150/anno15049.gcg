>Winter: ABGHINR C7 HANG +30 426
#note Tough decision. The bag just screams bingos. This play could have been even tougher if I had seen the glaring hook that I was missing.
>Nuala_O'Rourke: DEILLT 1E TILLED +35 410
#note OH SHIZZN!!!

I TOTALLY MISSED THAT.

I actually could have blocked with GA(U), but Quackle hates that.
>Winter: BEIILRY E1 .RILBY +22 448
#note This was a TOUGH position. I wrote down all the bingos I could see in the remaining 9 tiles, DRAINER, ANEROID, ARANEID, but I wasn't sure I hadn't missed an OD bingo, or, even worse, an OR bingo IF GOAR* were good (I had no idea). A bingo at 2A seemed virtually impossible, but I had another problem. Nuala was only 16 points down, an she could potentially score at 2B, putting the D on 2F, scoring 29 points, and setting herself to go out. I couldn't score that much, and with two tiles in the bag, going out was no guaranetee.

(T)RILBY seemed to kill everything, except any bingo through that L, which I couldn't see.
