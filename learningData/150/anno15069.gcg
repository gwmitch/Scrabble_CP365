#note Laid down YOGA, picked it up and played YAG instead. Really didnt like the A at 7I. I know it's way better equity wise, but a player like glen makes his living off of those easy opening. Probably should have played it. (-6)
>Glenn_Dunlop: INZ J6 ZIN +40 126
#note Well, suspicions confirmed at least. Saved myself 20+ points on YAG vs YOGA

#note Nice try glenn. Insta challenged this off
>Nick: CEIMOOX F8 .OX +56 176
#note Didn't see any point in trying to block bingos.

#note Of course.
>Nick: EHIIMNR J10 HI. +29 243
#note miss HITMEN J10, MITHER J10. They're a little tough but I need to see them, they're significantly better. HIT is third in the sim. (-5)
>Glenn_Dunlop: GNRU D10 RUNG +24 272
#note And the defensive laddering starts. I need to dictate the board dynamic when I see this coming
>Nick: ILLMNRS 5K M.LL +12 255
#note I need to see LIMNS n8. This actually sims 2nd best since I realize I'm holding the last S and there are no Ys left. It's not a bad setup, but LIMNS scores 35!! I would never get a chance to cash this.
>Glenn_Dunlop: IPT N8 TIP +32 304
#note Glenn takes the spot, shuts down bingos down O for the most part, and scores. This is why i need to needed to play LIMNS. Now I'm down 50 on a horrible board
>Nick: AIILNRS D3 NAIL +13 268
#note I realize the board is going to be bad very soon, so I try to open a lane for my S. ACINI H11 sims better.I saw it, but discounted it almost immediately because it didn't really seem to help my situation at all. Is there a better way to open this up? What to do in this position?
>Glenn_Dunlop: EJOU N2 JOU.E +28 332
#note Glenn continues to get power tiles and score with them, while of course closing my S hook
>Nick: BIIMRRS H12 .RIB +24 292
#note Not a great draw to my IRS. I make the obvious equity play. Is there a better option? Quackle likes it first and gives me only 20% to win from here
>Glenn_Dunlop: AFIW C1 WAIF +29 361
#note More seemingly mindless scoring.
>Nick: EIKMNRS 2B K. +12 304
#note Saw the obvious winker. This is my real mistake. I'm in bingo mode,  and not settling for less. 42 leave MS is more than enought o justify blowing this rack up. Plus with 3 Os unseen, AND keeping my M for 4O, I'm looking at the possibility of big points down O. Ugh, awful. This play cuts my chances of winning in half

#note well now I'm just commited to this ridiculousness.

#note way too late.
>Glenn_Dunlop: DOPR O1 DORP +48 454
#note hah
>Nick: BEEEEW A6 .WEEB +33 420
>Glenn_Dunlop: ERU N12 .URE +8 462
#note Well, that's that. It's hard to pinpoint the exact problem. Missing LIMNS (board vision problem), and not taking the points on WINKER seem to be the two glaring mistakes. Thoughts?
