#note W: Or C9 VARNA, K10 VAN...I think VAN might be the most prudent play - it makes a new S hook down column M, but that hardly matters given the giant one on column O, and it blocks double-doubles. The nice thing about AVANT is that AET is a good starting leave to try and hit that spot myself.

>Will: AABESTU O8 BATEAUS +90 274
#note W: This fit my criterion of being a word I would surely find somewhat difficult to challenge myself, so I tried it. J: My lifetime challenge grid against Will is not good, and it just got worse.  This seemed like too big a play to let go, even though he still had ABUSE, which I couldn't really block effectively.

>Joey: ?HLORSW 3L .OWL +28 276
#note J: Parallel plays to the J gave too much back.  I figured I might at least a decent floater up top.

>Joey: ?CEHIRS --  -91 276
#note J: I know of a Garfield comic strip in which he uses CRITCHER.  I couldn't find it right away.
>Will: GLOSTYY B10 G.YOT +26 370
>Joey: ?CEHIRS 4F CHEeRI.S +65 341
#note J: I wish I had thought of the possibility of fishing off the S and going for KERCHIEF.  He would obviously know what I'm up to, since he knows what I have.

>Joey: EEILOOR 15F OO.IE +11 352
#note J: Better to play REEL H2 first, threatening setting up two OORIE spots.  Some threat that would be.
