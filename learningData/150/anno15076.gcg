>Reid: AAEMQST H7 QAT +24 24
#note #1 play according to Championship player.
>Yukiko: LUV G8 LUV +12 12
>Reid: AAEMSTU 7H .UA +13 37
#note QUA is #2 (62.21%) according to 5 min-championship player. I had also considered AMU I9 (#1, 63.02%)) and TAU I8 (#5, 60.21%). In hindsight, AMU certainly seems to have the best leave and none of the defensive problems of QUA. Bad play.
>Yukiko: INZ 6J ZIN +63 75
>Reid: AAEMSTU L4 MA.TEAUS +72 109
#note Not only does my defensive gamble get crushed, my attempts to balance by playing off UA are rendered null after drawing the exact same tiles.

My play is the best play although I did hesitate a little bit before playing it because I wasn't sure if the plural was only MANTEAUX.
>Yukiko: AMX 8L .XAM +39 114
>Reid: ADDINRU M2 DUAD +19 128
#note DUAD (49.02%) and DUI (M3) are both #2. UNDID (M1) sims slightly higher at 49.72%. While the Q has already been played, I still prefer my play. I don't think opening the triple is worth two points and an extra tile from the bag. RIN is still a great leave.
>Yukiko: JOT 11I JOT. +22 136
>Reid: BEFINNR 2J FIN.ER +36 164
#note FINDER(53.83%) is #3 according to 5-min championship player. FIN (#1, 57.74%) and BIN (#2, 57.18%) at K5 are obviously better, but I would not notice this place for a few turns.

My intent was to score well and fork the triples.
>Yukiko: GKR J9 GR.K +11 147
>Reid: BEHINOR 1N HO +26 190
#note HO (64.30%) is #5 according to 5-minute championship player. 
HIN (68.27,% #1) and BIN (#3, 64.81%) at K5 are still unnoticed but I agree they are better than my play. 
BO (#4, 64.50%) is apparently slightly better than HO and ORBIER (#2, 65.29) was not considered. I don't like the leave for ORBIER, nor do I think its worth 1 extra point and the extra tile turnover.
>Yukiko: ?ADGNOT 3E TANGOeD +67 214
#note Yukiko, luckily for me, misses the beautiful MONTAGED O8.
>Reid: BEFINRR K5 F.R +40 230
#note I finally notice K5 and my play is #2 (47.12%). I notice #1 BRIEF (58.56%) a second after hitting my clock. I had been so focused on K5 in anticipation of such a great play that I failed to reassess the board after opponents bingo.
>Yukiko: HISV 13J SHIV +30 244
#note I was ready to throw down TABORINE or BARITONE but SHIV blocks those bingos.
>Reid: BEINORT N5 OBT.INER +76 306
#note I missed the natural BORNITE at A2 (79.38% )and A4 (78.03%). My play is #3 (77.76%).
>Yukiko: AAGILNS 11A AGNAILS +73 317
>Reid: ELNPRTY A11 .PTLY +39 345
#note My play is #2 (66.06%). REPLAY A7 is #1 (70.27%). I missed it. Normally I like to keep my E's, but there are an abundance of them unaccounted for, so I agree with Quackle here.
>Yukiko: ?EEEPRW E6 sWEEP.ER +62 379
>Reid: CEINORS -  +0 345
#note I was disheartened to see that I wouldn't be getting the last blank. I was a little irritated her play blocked my SCENARIO bingo. I held for a while, and unfortunately challenged the play. This was the biggest mistake of the game.

COG H1 (41.23%) with the beautiful leave is the #1 play here.
>Yukiko: IOWY 8A YOWI. +36 415
#note This is a great play by Yukiko. It scores well, blocks lanes and does not make any new easy lanes.
>Reid: CEINORS C6 CO.IN.ERS +82 427
#note Surprisingly, all Quackle championship players think EX at 7M (32.6%) is #1. My play is #2 (28.25%). I strongly disagree with Quackle here.
>Yukiko: BEEEEOO H1 BE. +18 433
#note Fortunately for me, Yukiko is left with a horrible final rack.
>Reid: CDEIIL 4A CEILI +22 449
#note The game is apparently unlosable at this point according to Quackle. I missed QUARTET 7M. My play, which is the second highest scoring play is ranked #7 according to valuation. I don't agree with Quackle's assessment of my play.
>Yukiko: EEEOO 7H .....E. +27 460
>Reid: D 7B D. +6 455
#note #1 of course.
>Reid:  (EEOO) +8 463
#note All of my plays were in the top 10 and most were in the top 3. I missed a natural and lost a challenge. Overall my play this game is A-.
