>Darrell_Day: GIN -  +0 30
#note Darrell knows like all of the 8s. But apparently he doesn't know his high-prob 7s :(
>Matt_Canik: ?ACGHOR E2 CHARG. +24 98
#note Missing two bingos, one through the E and one through the A. This is an abysmally bad play, but I didn't see any other good way to split up CG. HOAG(Y) would do just fine :(
>Darrell_Day: GIN 8H .....ING +45 75
#note GUACHARO and ECHOGRAM were the bingos I missed.
>Matt_Canik: ?DIKLNO 4D O.K +14 112
#note Another low-prob 8s missed here... DOwNLI(N)K. At least I stopped myself from playing PONDLIKE*. KOHL is a better play if I want to hold IN? for O1. 
>Darrell_Day: AEEHIPT 2A PETE.HIA +96 171
#note And it stops this!
This is counted as 98.

#note 6N
>Matt_Canik: CIJNOOT 11B COJOIN +34 328
#note With a slim lead and an increasingly muddying board, I chose to play this on top for 3 fewer points to prevent bingo oppoetunities for him. 
>Darrell_Day: ADGL 10E GLAD +19 304
>Matt_Canik: ?ITTUUZ L1 .UTZ +26 354
#note ITUUZ? is an interesting pull
>Darrell_Day: BEN N4 NEB +24 328
>Matt_Canik: ?AAITUX 13I XU +36 390
#note I feel like I have this game all but won now. 
>Darrell_Day: OW D11 .OW +26 354
>Matt_Canik: ?AAEIIT 3A TEA +23 413
#note I(O)TA is a better play here- it addresses the issue of the lane he just created. Wow that's good. 
>Darrell_Day: OY M12 .OY +12 366
>Matt_Canik: ?AIIIRV 15L VAIR +40 453
#note I've forgotten to record the score of Darrell's last play. I quickly do math and see that if he bingos I'll still win the game by 9 points (petechia was overscored by 2) so I play VAIR. Oops.
-
In a postmortem, I quickly notice V(EX)Il which stops all bingos except NEED(l)ERS through that blank L. I need to assume that an E is in the bag most of the time here, though. 
-
Q finds an even better play that wins 100% of the time: tRIVIA/SOYA. Man, if I had just added his score or thought for more than like 5 seconds.... damnit. 
-
I ended up winning high loss for this, so the joke became that I lost this on purpose in order to get more money at the end of the tournament. 
>Darrell_Day: DEELNRS 14B RELENDS +84 450
#note Somehow we missed COJOIN being misscored TWICE in this game, once in the game and once in the recount. Final: 455-456
>Darrell_Day:  (?EII) +6 456
