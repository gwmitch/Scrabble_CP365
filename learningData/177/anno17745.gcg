>Morris_Greenberg: ADEILRT 8B REDTAIL +70 70
#note This is one of those times I'm never sure if I should take the 2 extra points. Quackle likes this better than the other 70 pointers, but less than DILATER 8C for 68.
>Chris_Tallman: ?ACDLNO E5 DAL.ONiC +90 90
#note CT: The only 2x2!
>Morris_Greenberg: AGMMNPW 7C PA.M +25 95
#note This is nice for blocking all of the hotspots, but why do I want to block all of the hotspots with MMPW on my rack? W(I)MP G7 is better, and probably 7G MAW too.
>Chris_Tallman: EEOORUX 6A OXO +31 121
#note Well, on a positive note, after the game Chris said PALM did block a higher point X play for him.
>Morris_Greenberg: CGMNOOW F4 COM.. +30 125
#note Whoa, COW(MA)N plays in the same spot! That is best, though I am happy I found this, clearly the #2 option here. 
>Chris_Tallman: EEJRRSU D3 JEU +24 145
#note Too bad both M's are gone, no possibility for MEN(UDO)/M(O)/E(X)/N(OPE). Would've been awfully purty.
CT: H4 JUREL is better equity, worse scoring defense, and better bingo defense. There aren't any indications Morris is close to a bingo and the game is even so I think it's a tossup. 
>Morris_Greenberg: BGKNOSW I4 WONKS +26 151
#note GOWKS all the way in the same spot, why didn't I see that? 12C BO(C)K and 11B BOW(i)NG are also getting love from the sim, but let's face it, the sim is a generous lover and should better commit to the play it cares about instead of practicing infidelity.
>Chris_Tallman: AEEFRRS 4I .AFER +22 167
#note CT: Thought for a while about REFACERS* and decided against trying it. All my plays so far are simming best, what is this!?
>Morris_Greenberg: BGHNRTU 12A GRUT.H +28 179
#note I missed UNBR(i)GHT here. That was dumb (err, unbright) of me. I don't think I was really looking with BGHNRTU. Good lessons for all of you kids out there: don't do drugs, be honest, and always look for the bingo. Always.
CT: I held this even though I knew it since I was mad it blocked CREOLISE. When I saw ELOINERS I let it go though. I sure hope I would have anyway lolz.
>Chris_Tallman: EEILORS 10A ELOI.ERS +62 229
#note UNBR(i)GHT would've blocked ELOI(N)ERS and (C)REOLISE! Game-changing plays, brought to you by Morris Greenberg, mediocre scrabble player, and running as president of the stee-club (not to be confused with glee clubs, which have little to do with stees, or glee for that matter).
>Morris_Greenberg: BBEINNV 3J BINE +27 206
#note After only having 1 vowel for all of these turns, I hated that I had to use both of mine here. But, it is best, BIB 3J or B(O)NE 5H I guess are best if the frustrated player wants to keep a vowel.
>Chris_Tallman: ADEILQV H10 .LAVED +33 262
>Morris_Greenberg: BFGNPSV 5H F.PS +37 243
#note I was considering phonying with P(IF)F* here to set up the S.
CT: I probably would've challenged PIFF with 70% certainty especially since I know Morris likes playing short phonies for strategic purposes.
>Chris_Tallman: AEIIQWY N4 YEW +32 294
#note CT: Kept a killer leave here lol. WAFERY was held for about a minute. I didn't like QAID E15 because of the Z spot at F14 and I didn't like QADI F15 because of the S hook with him using one last turn. I didn't like this either but 32 points is too much to think about exchanging in a close game like this. Picked YEW over YAW because of the EQ anti-synergy and the sim agrees with me by 2%. 
>Morris_Greenberg: BEGNTVZ 14F ZE. +32 275
#note Geez, I missed G(E)EZ 14G here. That is a bit sloppy of me. V(ER)B M2 atually beats both, because the leave is that much better. GEEZ is 2nd best, ZEE is 3rd.
CT: I was pretty happy that he shut down the bottom and didn't kill me on the right. 
>Chris_Tallman: AAHIIIQ 3B HA.I +28 322
#note Hello QAII leave again! I thought of AHI M6 to set up QI L8 but I thought it too likely that he'd just use the spot. This sets up a much weaker QI anyway.
>Morris_Greenberg: BDGNTUV 2A DUB +26 301
>Chris_Tallman: AEIOQTT 2E QI +24 346
#note  CT: Thought of QAT E2, QI E2, and TOEA O5. I figured QAT E2 would give too much back and was hardly a better leave anyway. TOEA O5 kills the triple line and keeps QI E2 for next turn, but I didn't know if I could afford to wait here. Tough choice; the sim likes QI by 2%.
>Morris_Greenberg: GINTUVY 1F TIVY +32 333
#note This seems best, but (L)UNGYI is an awesome word I did not know.
>Chris_Tallman: ?AEIOTT A12 .OAT +15 361
#note CT: Looked for bingoes for like 5 minutes and eventually gave up and played this. Q likes IOTA C15 over this by 3% (92-89), I guess because if I draw 1 or 2 more I'sto my ITE? leave  it could be bad for me if I don't have a bingo.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEGNRTU 11H .UNG +10 343
#note That is a scarily good bingoing pool. My best chance is to let Chris bingo, and then I bingo out.
>Chris_Tallman: ?EINRST 15H .ISiNTER +77 438
#note CT: I calculated that even if Morris bingoes out, I'll still win since I'll be up 95 after this play and the highest scoring tile is a G, meaning he can either score with it or catch me with it at best. I'll draw 4, so he'll get 8-10 points from me. His highest scoring bingo possible is 81 (with the +8 points), so I'll still win by 6 in that scenario. If the score were closer I might have stalled since if I play any one tile off I'm still guaranteed a bingo next turn. 
>Morris_Greenberg: AAEINRT 15C ARIA +16 359
#note Missed (V)OGIE, and thought TEN(UDO)* was good. In other words, I basically failed in all aspects of ideal endgame play.
>Chris_Tallman: EGIO 13H .OGIE +10 448
#note CT: This may have been my best-played game of the tourney, but there were not many hard decisions for me so the difficulty score will not match the execution score :P
>Chris_Tallman:  (ENT) +6 454
