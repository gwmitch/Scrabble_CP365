>Emanuel: AACERTT 8D TEACART +70 70
#note Playing for second. If I lose I get 3rd. If Emanuel loses it depends. 

I had never seen this word and I imagined I would have by now, and that it was Collins
>Josh: ABEGINR -  +0 0
#note So, not a good start.
>Emanuel: DGJRU E4 JUDG.R +30 100
>Josh: ABEGINR D8 .ABERING +78 78
>Emanuel: OOPY 15D .OOPY +33 133
>Josh: AEKLRST K2 TALKERS +82 160
#note Emanuel mentioned that he thought I played much more like David Gibson that like Nigel before this game. Let's see how he likes a Nigel board! Explicitly chose TALKERS over STALKER because of the added volatility and the subtracted Z hotspot. It's probably not the right play. Who knows?
>Emanuel: EIY J6 YE.I +30 163
>Josh: AEHPSST 1K SHAPE +54 214
#note I did not know SPATHES and I missed PATH(L)ESS. I imagined SHAPE was better than SHA(R)PEST though. This is close to a 25-point error due to my lack of knowledge of SPATHES and maybe more like a 15-point error because I missed PATHLESS.
>Emanuel: OW 14F WO +30 193
#note Emanuel asked me if I had a bad rack. I said yes, finally I do.
>Josh: BOSTVVX C11 BOX +48 262
#note Needless to say drawing BOVVX to ST makes my rack a bad rack. Doesn't mean I can't do this!
>Emanuel: IO L4 OI +14 207
>Josh: AINSTVV H7 V.V +9 271
#note Good thing he blocked VIV(A)NT* with his last play or else I would have lost a turn. Between this and I3 VIVA or 10F VIVAS I think I choose this because of Emanuel's last play implying a good leave.
>Emanuel: AEZ 6D A.ZE +34 241
#note "Finally you had a bad rack!", says Emanuel.
>Josh: AAEINST 2G ASTA.INE +85 356
>Emanuel: ?EILNOU 1B OUtLINE +76 317
#note ASTATINE was held and released.
>Josh: CFIINNR 13G FICIN +29 385
#note First I laid FIRN down and noticed the possibility of QAIDS. It's so remote though. I decided this was better anyway. 
>Emanuel: DEFGILN 14J FEIGN +49 366
#note First FELID, then FEIGN. Which is unfortunate. Cause
>Josh: AEEILNR B1 .E +4 389
#note I would have a bingo if he played FELID. Now I have to choose between making a strategic fish or playing I2 (T)RAILE(R). Probably the latter, but I bingo so often with AEILNR! Actually only around half of the time, not much more than that. Hmm. 
>Emanuel: DDHMQW -WQHDMD +0 366
>Josh: AEILNRT A2 RELIANT +76 465
#note I am lucky though, so no need to do the math.
>Emanuel: HMSU O12 MUSH +46 412
>Josh: ?OOQRTU B10 TO +9 474
#note I missed M9 QUOhO(G), but I wouldn't be sure enough to play it. Can you find the play that Championship player can't find, but which ends up also winning by 99?

I can, but that's only if Emanuel doesn't play optimally. 
>Emanuel: DDDELMW 3M DEW +27 439
#note LEWD/LOBE for the lesser loss. (-2)
>Josh: ?OQRU A11 ROQUe +48 522
#note So yeah Champ still couldn't find TO. It's the second best endgame play. I thought I had nailed one... Adam was watching too! Whatever.
>Josh:  (DDLM) +16 538
#note I got so lucky. This is how I won 2nd.
