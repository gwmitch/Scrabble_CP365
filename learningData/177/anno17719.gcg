>Kristiina: AAHI D8 HAI.A +32 126
>Josh: ADELLST 12F STALLED +75 148
#note Scored as 76. Since this is 75 maybe E3 STALLED is actually better, they seemed quite close, but I might be overestimating how much she will score on average next turn if I instead choose to exert more board control with this STALLED rather than immediate defense with the other. Interesting decision.

>Josh: AEEGIPX 3I P.XIE +34 182
#note I chose this over H12 (A)PEX because less of the less vowelly leave and the defense, since this play blocks almost 4 floaters (but gives back another that isn't that lucrative) while APEX gives her a free E to bingo through. Still food for thought between the two plays.

>Josh: CEORSTT E2 COTTERS +74 307
#note I wasn't at all sure this was a word but it seemed worth playing and it made sense. I had a feeling if it was good it meant the same thing as a COTTIER.
>Kristiina: AEHP 2B PEA.H +40 259
>Josh: ?AIINWY 11K YAW +33 340
#note hmm, I didn't consider 1F AWNY, which should have been worth considering. 
>Kristiina: ELNO K5 ENOL +22 281
>Josh: ?IIMNRU 8K .INUM +24 364
#note This is the turn I spent the longest on during this game, cause it looked very possible that I had a playable bingo, but no, I didn't. D2 (A)MU looks like a good play as well as this
>Kristiina: EOW 1F OWE +23 304
>Josh: ?EEIORS O8 .OpERIES +80 444
#note I thought she could have a bingo through the M so I didn't look for (D)OwERIES which apparently is better than this. Maybe she could have something playing through the D...
>Kristiina: AEINORZ 1A ZONA +51 355
#note D1 Z(A)NIER and 4A ZONA(T)E are both better than this
