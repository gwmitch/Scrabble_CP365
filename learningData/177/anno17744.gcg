#note Emanuel may have thought EXILER is Collins, since he normally plays that dictionary.
>Morris_Greenberg: AADEHIL 11G .AILHEAD +74 100
#note I thought RAILHEAD was risky enough that sacrificing 4 points for NAILHEAD made sense. Sim disagrees.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: HNORS O11 SHORN +49 143
>Morris_Greenberg: FIILNOY 12D LIN.Y +35 135
#note I thought FLINGY* had a chance of being good too, and even considered trying it this turn. That made me lean towards this play instead of the 12I plays like FOIL, FOIN, NOILY, and OILY, and L8 FIN(E)LY. They are all within 1.5% on the sim, but FOIN seems best, holding the underrated -ILY ending.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: ?JMNNOO M7 NONM.JOr +86 229
#note Well, about those 12I plays from last turn...

Also, this play affected the game in about as opposite a way as the definition of the word itself.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?AAIKLV A4 .AIKAi +54 312
#note Figured I basically need a big play and a bingo to win. This is big, and with all of the E's and T's in the bag, something like ELEVATED O1 next turn is a possibility.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: CU O6 CU. +6 407

>Emanuel_Chicoine: CDIT 4H .DICT +16 423
>Morris_Greenberg: BEEETTT 3B BET +20 346
#note Well, I guess I got those E's and T's. I don't know what I was trying to fish for here that fit. I guess I was hoping that Emanuel would try blocking but open the triple and I could bingo out. It is probably smarter to just accept defeat here though. To be fair, Quackle says this wins more than 2% of the time, better than any other play. Therefore, the correct strategy here is a bit complicated:

1. Set up 50 scrabble boards like this
2. Resume play on whichever one wins OR accept 1/50 of a win as a settlement.
3. Play BET in the same spot on all 50 boards.
>Emanuel_Chicoine: AEERRST 2C SERRATE +65 488
#note Well, I guess that's part of the sacrifice for the 2% win chance. This is what I get for skipping step 1 last turn.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEEGITT 1D GEE +17 363
>Emanuel_Chicoine: O 10M .O +11 499
#note Couldn't do much about this game, aside from the 50 board thing.
