>Josh: ??DJOPZ -JP +0 0
#note This was a really weird start. I thought JO gave back too much to be worth keeping a 3-consonant-2-blank leave.
>Chris: BRRTTWW -BRTWW +0 0
#note JS: BTW nice rack bro
CT: Keep RT or just R?
>Josh: ??ADOUZ H6 AZO +24 24
#note I missed a bingo I didn't know
>Chris: DEIIRTT 7E DIT. +15 15
#note CT: I knew ZIT was the highest equity play, but i figured after his exch 2, he probably would've bingoed without picking up the Z, and ZITI/ZITS is too dangerous a spot to give him (2x2'S etc). The sim likes I5 IT for 4 better than DITZ, which i considered since it's deceptively defensive and keeps DEIRT. I think I agree with it in hindsight.
>Josh: ??DFLOU 8H .UtFLoOD +83 107
#note JS: highest-scoring bingo if it were valid, held and released :)
CT: Held this and didn't like it, but figured Josh would play another bingo with his 2 blanks if he didn't know this was good. I underestimated his craziness obviously :P
>Chris: EEFIIRT 9L IF +19 34
#note JS: 9M FIE
CT: Was considering K7 IFFIER for a while and decided against it, decided to fish and almost snap-played this afterwards. This is a psychological mistake I find myself making pretty often; once I start weighing a couple of plays deeply, I fail to return to the 'surface' and consider all my options. I think K5 FIEF is the best play since it keeps the board more open than 9M FIE.
>Josh: AOOOPVY I7 Y.P +37 144
#note  JS: K5 POO(F) for 18 has better equity than this! but this has to be right
CT: Yup. 
>Chris: EEIKLRT 8A TRIKE +45 79
#note CT: Considered TRIKE and KEA F6. Didn't consider D6 LEK, which the sim likes a bit better. I still like TRIKE since it keeps the board a bit more open and if Josh can mostly afford a cheap block of the D next turn if he wants with his lead if I close the left side now and I'm in trouble, esp with both blanks already played.
>Josh: AAEOOOV 10J VOE +17 161
#note Wanted to block YUPS but also do something that I didn't actually do which was make the bottom half less accessible. I should play 9D AVO or exchange.
>Chris: AADEILM O1 MALADIE. +89 168
#note JS: he took too long to play this and I wasn't too sure so I should have challenged but it looked valid for some reason.
CT: I saw this while he was thinking on his turn and decided that I thought it has a 25% chance of being good. I looked for other bingoes and when I didn't find any (there are none), decided to play this after about 3 minutes. Didn't look for or see the best real play, KALMIA E8. I know Josh knows I don't phony as often as him in tourneys so I figured there was at least another 40-50% chance he would let it go if it were invalid, hence I valued this play at about 50 equity, plus it's volatile and I need that right now.
>Josh: AAEEOOP B6 PA.EO +15 176
#note Thoughts?
>Chris: BIILNNT N4 NIB +26 194
#note CT: Thought of BINIT C7 too, but this is pretty clearly better.
>Josh: AEGHNOU 6E OH +30 206
#note JS: goodbye X and QI hotspot
>Chris: EIINQRT C5 QI +15 209
#note CT: I'd much rather have scored 31 keeping EIINRT than have to do this :( Didn't like that there were 3 U's out and that the board is not conducive to my INTER leave really but TINIER A10 seemed too crazy. 

>Josh: AEEGNNU 1L NEU. +7 213
#note JS: I'm clueless here.
CT: I understand the impulse to get rid of the U with 2 more in the pool and no Q, so I don't like NAE E5. But ENUF K5 looks better than this since any play using the lanes it creates will give playback and it scores 7 more.
>Chris: ENTY 2K YENT. +24 233
#note CT: My scoresheet was too messy to give Josh my rack here lol. I hope I didn't miss a 6 at A10 hehe...
>Josh: AEEGNSX K10 .X +18 231
#note JS: I missed 5E NAG again. This is horri-awful
CT: It does seem really bad but at least it screwed with me and made me think he had a super strong bingo leave including an O.
>Chris: CEINRTW A10 WINCER +41 274
#note Didn't see the 2x2 C(ODE)INE for 40 but this is best anyway. Saw and almost played WINTER first lol.
>Josh: AEEGJNS 3J JAGS +39 270
>Chris: CHISSTT D8 .ITSCH +30 304
#note CT: Was happy to see this! One of the coolest finds I made this tourney I think :) I think my leave was NS and not ST given my rack 2 turns from now. 
>Josh: AEELMNT 15A .EMANTLE +83 353
>Josh: AEELMNT --  -83 270
#note JS: why
CT: I would've challenged anyway but my horrible draw made it a necessity far below the level of certainty I had of REMANTLE's invalidity.
>Chris: GGSTV -GGV +0 304
#note JS: exched 5 consos keeping NS
CT: I had DLGGVSN i think. Should I just keep the S here or make a different exchange?
>Josh: AEELMNT 5E MAE +30 300
>Chris: AEINOSS 12K OI +14 318
#note JS: Chris is quite low on time here
CT: Considered (C)OS(H), K12 OS, C13 OI, and this. The sim is liking CASH, COSH, and just OXO better than this. This is where his earlier OX play screwed with me as I thought he had an O for sure and wanted to take out the spot. I forgot about my rack knowledge due to REMANTLE* due to time pressure and general brain fuzziness despite writing it down lolz. I'd play CASH if I could do it over and try to hit OXO next turn since he's only drawing 3 and didn't keep one hehe.
>Josh: ELNRTTW 13C T.REW +30 330
>Chris: ABENOSS 12F BOS +15 333
#note JS: difficult play, don't like Chris' choice but he's low on time again
CT: I wanted to set up my S's for the triple lane but there doesn't seem to be a good way to do that here. BO M5 seems to maximize bingo chances next turn and scores the same as my play of BOS F12 so I guess it looks best?
>Josh: EGLLNTU 14F GLUTEN +29 359
#note JS: Thought about ENGLUT but it was 5 less, although better defense. I had to gamble here I guess
>Chris: AAENRSU 15G SNARE +34 367
#note CT: Q wants me to fish, but that's retarded since there's only one lane. Slapped down SNARE and hoped to draw 2 outplays for the win since I had like 40 seconds left here
>Josh: ADEGLRR M11 GLAD +15 374
#note (YA)RER first. -6 but I knew this won and was running out of time so I played it
>Chris: AOUV 4H AVO +16 383
#note JS: AVO(ID)
CT: I'm not sure how you avoided my luckbox powers this game :(
>Josh: ERR 15M ERR +16 390
>Josh:  (U) +2 392
