>Joel: EFMU 8G FUME +18 18
>Josh: EHINOTV J6 VO. +14 14
#note I guess I could risk 7I HOVE. 7F VINO looks alright too, but I wanted to cripple FUMED/FUMER/FUMET/FUMES.
I think I also overestimated my leave a tad.
>Joel: BOO 7E BOO +12 30
>Josh: EHINTTW 8A WITHE +49 63
>Joel: EGINOST D8 .ISTOGEN +76 106
>Josh: DEFILNT 15A FIN.ED +30 93
#note Nowhere for FLINTED. I would have played it if there were a place for it but I wouldn't be entirely sure of it. That's why I didn't play 15A FLI(N)TED. I felt the 5% risk of it being invalid overrode the small superiority of the play. I missed B8 INFIDEL/INFIELD. I was too fixated on 15D.
>Joel: ?ADDHRS K7 SRADDHa +84 190
#note nice
>Josh: AILRSTT 13G RATT.ILS +68 161
#note Oh, I saw TITULARS through a U the turn before then I stopped looking at the U. H8 (U)LTRAIST is something I need to have seen. I think that even TIT(U)LARS is a better play than RATTAILS. 
>Joel: III -III +0 190
>Josh: ACEEIPR H11 AP.CE +36 197
#note I looked a while for 8s this turn. I missed 14B PE(E)RIE, which seems like a good play too.
>Joel: EJKU L4 JUKE +33 223
>Josh: EEGIMPR L12 M.G +26 223
#note Wasn't sure of IMPRE(S)E or EMPRI(S)E. I saw EME(E)R but not EPE(E) at 14A. PE(E) there also seems decent. There are a lot of moves to think about this turn. My choice is one of them. 
>Joel: EORZ 6B ZERO +38 261
>Josh: ?EEIPRU N6 PEnURIE. +67 290
#note Here I chickened out of PERIQUE. That's another bad mistake. 
>Joel: EGILNTW O1 WINGLET +95 356
#note I held this cause it seemed he had nowhere for WELTING and because WINGLET looked kind of unfamiliar. I don't know why I challenge words like WINGLET against Joel, but I always seem to doubt that they are in TWL. That actually kind of makes up for his personal confusion between the two lexica I would say, at least when he plays me. But yet again I make a large mistake against someone, and it's costly. 
>Josh: INQSUXY -  +0 290
>Joel: AELNOR 5C RELOAN +28 384
#note he's going for the S etc.
>Josh: INQSUXY 14B QU.Y +61 351
>Joel: CIOV H1 COVI. +33 417
>Josh: ABINSTX N1 AX +41 392
#note I felt this gave me a good chance, considering the pool wasn't that good-looking and that I probably had a free 42 points next turn with I(N)S/WINGLETS
>Joel: ADILNOR 1D IRON.LAD +62 479
#note but no, I couldn't catch a break. I shouldn't have caught one in any case, since I screwed up way too many times this game.
>Josh: ABINSTY 10A ABY. +15 407
#note this is 7 off 11A BAN(T)Y. But I thought he was going to block WINGLETS/INS. 
>Joel: AAE J10 AA +12 491
#note Joel's best play is M8 A(n) for one point!
>Josh: INST 8M I.S +42 449
>Joel: E C10 .E +7 498
#note N1 (AX)E!
>Joel:  (NT) +4 502
