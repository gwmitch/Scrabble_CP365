>Joel: AWW 8G WAW +18 18
#note Seth was next to Joel here and he was looking at Joel's rack. That and Joel taking longer than usual made me think that he had the blank. Joel confirmed afterwards.
>Josh: EJLLORY J6 JOLLY +49 49
#note I was also hoping he would exchange so I could play this for 46, but 49 is good too. Lucky pull so far. 
>Joel: PZ H7 Z.P +14 32
#note I was waiting a play opening up the board
>Josh: CEGORRS 10B GROCERS +81 130
#note look at the beauty of this board already. haha
>Joel: EIT E10 .ITE +12 44
>Josh: AAHNOTU D12 UH +19 149
#note I wanted to block the most prominent lane but chose the wrong word to do so cause I wanted to get rid of my U. I should have played D12 AHA. 
>Joel: ?QS -Q +0 44
>Josh: ?AAENOT C3 EmANATO. +68 217
#note I drew E? This is the only bingo but I looked a while for 9s or something like ATENA(Z)O(O)N*


>Joel: ?ADEILS D1 DILAtES +77 121
#note 4A SE(m)IbALD would have made for a good Rob Ford word and for a good play in this position.
>Josh: BEEIORX 1A OXI.E +39 256
>Joel: EKY E3 KYE +36 157
>Josh: BELMRRT 13C T..RM +26 282
#note THERMEL is a new word for me. What do I do here? I didn't want to give him easy points with THERME but it seemed like my best option. I couldn't see anything I knew that was better. Maybe exchange? Maybe A1 (O)RB or 5B M(AtE)R? They look pretty good despite not scoring. 
>Joel: CDEENRT H12 CENT +38 195
#note THERM is made better by the fact that I can overlap with THERMEL. Now there are lanes I can't block. This is his rack
>Josh: BEFGLRU 8A BU. +15 297
#note I knew BUG(G)ER B7 was the equity play but it just hands him scoring spots. Maybe it's correct anyway? 14G E(N)GULF also permits Joel to pave the road for a comeback but the pool is kind of bad... I chose the safe play?
>Joel: GU 6J .UG +11 206
>Josh: EFGLNRT K4 FL. +12 309
#note Going for an I, lots of them left. 12H (C)LEFT seems to compete with this and with K5 F(U)R
>Joel: DEOR L1 DORE +24 230
#note I was waiting for this
>Josh: EGINNRT 1H TREN.ING +140 449
#note hahahahahah
>Joel: HI 2A HI +33 263
>Josh: EEIIINV 12H .IVIE +20 469
>Joel: DF F9 D.F +12 275
>Josh: AEINOOV J12 .IVA +18 487
#note Here I considered M6 AVION too. Both of those look like good plays and in hindsight I guess AVION is better because it actually blocks more things than VIVA it would seem, including the E in CIVIE which looks like the best lane given the pool.
>Joel: BDEIMRT L8 TIMB.RED +66 341
#note damn
>Josh: ENOOQSU 15L .O +3 490
#note M9 NOOSE seems really good here. I think I didn't notice the Q spot at 11I so I didn't consider dropping that many tiles. I played this cdause I had a 50% chance of drawing into QUEANS for 72 that he would have to block. M6 SOON is champ's best bet.
>Joel: AAAANOP M8 ANOA +18 359
#note S in the bag? jeez

N1 (N)APA first is 1 point better but this was a good endgame by Joel
>Josh: ENOQSSU N11 SUQS +31 521
>Joel: AAP N1 .APA +12 371
>Joel:  (ENO) +6 377
#note I kind of should have won by more than this.
