>Chris: EINRRTU 8G RUNTIER +66 66
#note This was the most enjoyable game of the tourney for me. Off to a flying start, but I flew too close to the sun and crashed my nonexistent jet in a couple of turns :P
>Joel: AAAFINN 7F FAN +12 12
#note NAIF H9. I know the rack because Josh was in ninja stealth mode (for all you Survivor fans hehe) and told me after. And no, my jet is not a FANJET.
>Chris: ?EEGIOY 6B YOGEE +26 92
#note So after Joel played FAN, I look over at Josh and he's laughing and starts laughing harder despite himself when Joel draws and looks disgusted. I have a tendency to laugh uncontrollably in situations like this so I kept my head down and stared at my tiles for 2 minutes. As the brute that keeps taking cheapshots in the Mighty Ducks movies says - 2 minutes? Well worth it! :P (This is simming best and playing open seems right given the above commentary)
>Joel: AAAEIIN M7 A.IA +6 18
#note More stealth rack knowledge. This sims pretty evenly with a bunch of exchanges. Him scoring 6 points brightened my mood and caused me to soar ever higher...
>Chris: ?EEHIJL J2 HELIJE.s +91 183
>Chris: ?EEHIJL --  -91 92
#note And I crash in a spectacular burst of flame upon reentry into the atmosphere in my HELIJET*! I was very close to just playing JET but I'm up 92-18 with a blank so I decided to just say screw it I'm playing this. When it came back invalid I said 'worth a try I think' and he replied 'I don't think so, don't you think you would've seen it by now?' in a slightly insulted tone. lolzzzz
>Joel: ADEGINT K8 .DEATING +70 88
#note Good choice by Joel to open the triple with his rack knowledge rather than play it at K3.
>Chris: ?EEHIJL J6 JE. +26 118
#note Should I tack the E on for JETE for 4 points? The sim says no and I agree I think.
>Joel: ADEO 14J A.ODE +16 104
>Chris: DEGHILW 15H WEI.H +59 177
#note A huge plethora of high-scoring options here, before and after he played ANODE. Was going to debate betwen WHILE J10 and WHILED N10 and now there's WHILED I13 for 50. What I played seems best offensively, simming 1% ahead of WHILED, but WHILED's defense and better leave is attractive too so idk
>Joel: AABEU 12I BA.EAU +16 120
#note Please can I draw the X ONE TIME dealer!
>Chris: ?CDILLT B2 DILL. +18 195
#note Considered D(E)C(A)L J10 and DILLY B2. DECAL blocks better and keeps what I think is a slightly better leave but DILLY scores 4 more. Simming within 0.5% at 91ish% to win each with DECAL on top.
>Joel: KOP 3A K.P +18 138
#note Laid down POKE E3 then said 'That's just silly' and switched to this. Made me think he was consonant-heavy if he's saving his vowel for 2 less points.
>Chris: ?ACGMTX 10J M.G. +13 208
#note Thought briefly about CoTAX O8 but I gotta respect Joel's rating a little bit lolz. I was being super greedy not cashing MAX for 44 here but the sim agrees with me by 1%! Also, this gets rid of good scoring spots for consonants and I read him for those last turn.
>Joel: OT 15N TO +8 146
#note Yes please I'll take fries with that!
>Chris: ?ACRTX O8 ReTAX +81 289
#note I don't have my last tile here but I missed CAReX for 87 :( 
>Joel: DEINRST 9A TINDERS +64 210
#note He sacrificed 8 points here for defense by not playing it at N1 but I don't hate it. This is about 2.75% to win according to Q and N1 is 4.2%.
>Chris: CFNOQSS 10A OF +28 317
#note I didn't see D1 FOSS but it seems needlessly dangerous. Considered QIS for 14 at B8 and OF A10. They're simming equivalently but I think QIS avoids more distaster scenarios; I'd play it given a do-over here.
>Joel: BEMN A7 EN..MB +39 249
#note Nice play by Joel here. Punished me a bit for not playing QIS.
>Chris: CHNOQSS D1 COSH +34 351
#note I can't really block everything in the bottom left so I just took the points. This sims best. 
>Joel: CEILPRV -CEILPRV +0 249
#note I think he exchanged here cause his score is 0. Why must I write so messily :P
>Chris: INOQSUZ N6 QI +33 384
#note I guess QUOINS but everything is over 99% to win here.
>Joel: OPRU 1D .ROUP +27 276
>Chris: NOSUYZ 13A SOYUZ +45 429
#note Don't have the last tile but it prob doesn't change my play
>Joel: EW 14B WE +25 301
>Chris: ?NORV E11 Vi.OR +32 461
>Joel: CEILLST 2F STELLIC +73 374
>Joel: CEILLST --  -73 301
#note Never trust a man who has nothing to lose. You just got soul-read sir :P
>Chris: AINV H1 .AVIN +11 472
>Chris:  (CEILLST) +18 490
