>Morris_Greenberg: EEFILNN 8D FENNE +24 24
#note Rustiness leads to me phonying sometimes. Greediness does too, but this really wasn't one of those times, I thought the word was good. 
>Tobey_Roland: IQ 7C QI +26 26
>Morris_Greenberg: EEHHILN 9E HEEL +20 44
#note I missed ELHI I7, this seems second best after that. ELHI 9G and EH 7G or 9G also are worth considering.
>Tobey_Roland: EOR 6D ROE +11 37
>Morris_Greenberg: BEGHINO 5E HOB +28 72
#note Either this or HONGI in the same spot.
>Tobey_Roland: ATV 4C VAT +18 55
>Morris_Greenberg: EGIJLNS I2 JINGLES +76 148
#note FENNE* is one of those phonies that doesn't take the S hook. Who knew? I personally thought it was a noun, so I didn't even consider its potential phoniness.
>Tobey_Roland: AMP 10H MAP +18 73
>Morris_Greenberg: AAGKNRT 11I TANK +22 170
#note Setting up the TANKA hook.
>Tobey_Roland: EEGY L8 GEE.Y +30 103
>Morris_Greenberg: ??AGRRR -RR +0 170
#note G(N)ARR is better I missed that at the time. I did consider GRA(B) G2, but ultimately thought it shut down too much. Then again, I had two blanks...

Also, in awesome phony department AARRRGH*.
>Tobey_Roland: AELORRT M3 REALTOR +74 177
>Morris_Greenberg: ??ADGIR 12D GlADIeR +73 243
#note This sims better than all the N lane bingoes, those are just too risky, despite being worth more. tRIAGeD in the same spot is the only bingo that sims higher, since it's 3 more points.
>Tobey_Roland: AI M12 AI +9 186
>Morris_Greenberg: EIRTUUX G12 .UI +5 248
#note This seems best, there is risk here, but it closes a lot of bingos with the lane Tobey just created, and sets up big X and T plays.
>Tobey_Roland: BUZ 4L Z.BU +32 218
>Morris_Greenberg: EMORTUX F14 XU +50 298
>Tobey_Roland: FIU 2G FU.I +16 234

#note A bunch of great plays here, any of CO(U)TER 15D, CORN(U)TE 15B, NOM 1F, OM 1G, or this looks great, I am >96% to win here.
>Tobey_Roland: ACDI 1D CADI +15 249

#note Luckbox.
>Tobey_Roland: SY 8L ..YS +24 273
>Morris_Greenberg: ADELNST C2 LA. +12 437
#note Hoping he plays parallelly to give me a bingo line. I am winning this no matter what. Also, of everything in the bag, how in the world did I draw into this beautiful rack?

#note Best

>Morris_Greenberg: EST 13I SET +14 478
#note Through two games of Morris' mediocre return, I decided to be deceptive and play well and draw well too. I decided thereafter I should be politer in the rest of my games and resume making larger mistakes.
