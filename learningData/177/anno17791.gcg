#note I was pretty sure this was phony, but why not give it a shot?
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADEGINU 7F U.GAINED +68 119
#note A common phony and I didn't even hold...
>Thomas_Reinke: ABEIINV 1E VI.INA +33 105
#note This gives up big scores at J2 but there are now so many hotspots that it doesn't matter.
>Harriette_Lakernick: IMOPU A1 OPIUM +34 153
>Thomas_Reinke: BEEEOSW 2I EWE +29 134
#note Not sure enough of 2J BOWSE to play it. This is not a ton worse.

#note I'm not a great player but I don't agree with Quackle that D3 SOOT is better than this.

#note 14J DORSA doesn't commit me to bingoing as much as this does.

#note Underscored by 1
>Thomas_Reinke: HINOPRS 6F H. +27 285
#note 08 BIGHORNS. Another one of those plays that I would be lucky to find. Also 14J PRISON. This basically only bingos if I draw an E or the blank.
>Harriette_Lakernick: CJK 12L J.CK +44 398
>Thomas_Reinke: EINOPRS 14G ORPINES +73 358
#note Quackle wants me to to 14J PROSE, thinking it wins way more than this. I don't see it but okay.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?EGLQRT 15F Qi +11 409
#note She must have thought I had something good in this spot.

>Harriette_Lakernick: EGLRT 10D GEL +12 421
>Thomas_Reinke: ERRY B1 YE +29 419
#note She said something to the effect of "Oh shizz, I think you win." after I made this play. I'd be upset too if I thought I had the game in the bag and then 20 points suddenly disappeared from my score.
