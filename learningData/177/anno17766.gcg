#note UNDEAD or exchange 2? Q prefers playing by about 2.5 points.

#note If your opponent exchanges 1/2/3 on the first turn, I think JEU should always be played at 8H instead of 8G.

>Matt_Canik: CDEGNSV 14F VE.D +16 195
#note A lot of unexciting options this turn: 
G(Y)VED gives back huge row 14 plays.
VE(L)D holds 4 consonants and is generally meh.
SCEND scores 28 but holds GV, which will be bad if Jim opens a big threat next turn. 
VENG(E) gives the A hook. 
Exchanging doesn't do all that much for me here since bingos will seldom go down.

Looking at things after the fact, I think I like grabbing the available points with SCEND.

#note Ouch, 2x2 blocked :(. 

This is WAY better than the other options, and my rule of thumb is ''if it's a competitive event, it probably takes an S''. I was wrong here.

>Matt_Canik: AEIILOT O11 AI.LE +18 357
#note Had a really really hard time deciding what to do here. If Jim has a bingo starting in an A from A6, I lose. But he's just played 3 tiles which makes that sort of unlikely. 

AIOLI A6 sets up different bingos. Given that Jim just played 3 consonants, it implies that he was still consonant heavy which makes me think he's somewhat likely to have RT? or R? or T? on his rack, making AIOLI a worse play.

I don't really know what to do here. I think AISLE allows me to outrun in most cases, holds tiles to addess a bingo line he tries to set up, and, importantly, keeps a consonant.
