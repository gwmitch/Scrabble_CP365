#note WO(R)RIT D8 also is an option, though I (and Quackle) prefer this setting up the T.
>Joel_Horn: ABOT 11B BOAT +31 159
>Morris_Greenberg: CGHILRT D7 CH...L +30 162
#note Oh right CH(ORA)GI is a thing. I also forgot about the E hook when playing this, which is sloppy of me. GLITCH F2, (N)IGH 8L, and maybe even G(ORA)L in the same spot are likely better for this reason.

>Joel_Horn: AEILM --  -28 159
>Morris_Greenberg: GIINRTT B11 .RIT +12 174
#note Chickened out on (E)NGIRT, rustiness. Given the rack knowledge, this is actually better though, as it sets up my T, and it is unlikely he holds an H, S, or T with MELIA and did not bingo last turn. Quackle also really likes IT F6 here, to create an ING bingo lane. 
>Joel_Horn: AAEILM A12 AMIA +30 189
>Morris_Greenberg: GIINTTX 13A ..X +24 198
#note Huh, GITTIN, a Jew word I didn't know, quite rare. That wins the Quackle sim (F2), as it scores some points, kills the easiest bingo line, takes six from a bag with ??SSS unseen, and sets up my X for next turn. IXI(A) K3 is also a bit better, since it creates an (I)NG spot.
>Joel_Horn: HLU 11I HUL. +19 208

#note Nothing great here, maybe GITE 12F, GIT F5, or TITI(A)N K2 instead?
>Joel_Horn: DE 13A ...ED +27 235
>Morris_Greenberg: BFGINOT N8 .OFTING +38 248
#note Phony, but SOOOOOOOOO much better than all of my other options (~15% better!)

#note First played AEO(N) N2, then switched to this
>Morris_Greenberg: ADEFGMR O1 FREA. +39 362
#note This is not that great since it opens bingo lines with both blanks unseen. DAG 13I is simming best, with DEFA(N)G N1, and DAM 13I also finishing higher.
>Joel_Horn: E 10N .E +5 315
>Morris_Greenberg: ??ADGGM N3 DA.G +15 377
#note This, GAG(E) 3L and GAM(E) 3L are the only plays winning 100% of the time according to the duck. What a draw.

Also, in the awesome phony department, I was sort of hoping I could play AGGADIM* (or HAGGADIM* for that matter). DeMAGoG is the only real one in here for those of you keeping score at home (and by score, I mean some arbitrary bingo testing system that has no direct relation to score in Scrabble, though could have correlation for all I know).
