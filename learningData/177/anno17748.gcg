#note (V)ICUGNA is a cool word I did not know. This is best though.
>Judy_Horn: BOT 7G BOT +18 48
>Morris_Greenberg: ?ACNNSY J6 CANNY +30 48
#note Missed (I)NStANCY 11D for 98!  Also missed CANYoNS and CYANiNS in a few spots, and CYANiN(E)S and CAYeNN(E)S at E2. This is better than some bingos and all non-bingoes, but still 10% behind INSTANCY. In short, this play is unideal, because there are better plays. Expert analysis.
>Judy_Horn: AENOPRT H1 OPERAT.. +33 81
#note Blocked Judy's bingoes here. This is a nice find by her, though (N)ONPAR 8J looks a bit better.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AJQSWX I1 WAX +47 95
#note (PA)JAMAS would be fun to draw into. In short, this play is ideal, because it adds more net points than all other plays the highest percentage of the time. Expert analysis.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?JLQRSU F10 Q. +31 126
#note Yeah, I was playing too fast, thinking about that steak dinner reservation I had in an hourish at this point....

(To be fair though, Joshua Sokol, the meat was delicious, and I feel no remorse for enjoying something so much that tastes so good, despite whatever suffering may have occurred to deliver this meal from the heavens, or any other equivalent level of awesomeness for those of you who believe in alternative forms of supreme beings and/or afterlife.)

#note ...and I still get to play it.

>Judy_Horn: ADL 13L DAL +35 304
>Morris_Greenberg: IINSSTY 14A .INY +20 297
#note Quackle likes a bunch of plays getting rid of SY and keeping IINST a bit more than this, like SY(N) 9H, (JO)YS B10, S(PA)Y 2G, (PA)YS 2H, and S(EX)Y 3G. I overlooked the strength of the leave IINST.
>Judy_Horn: EKN G3 KEN +35 339
>Morris_Greenberg: DEEISST J1 ED +23 320
#note Maybe ES in the same spot so it's more likely I hit column N with an -ED bingo. Sim is really close between my play, ES, and 9H SE(N)D, which creates a nice lane.
>Judy_Horn: AG 15D AG +10 349
>Morris_Greenberg: EIIMSST E2 ITEMIS.S +72 392
#note I played this over STIMIES because it is better. I played this over MITISES because I forgot that MITISES was a word. Expert analysis.

#note Playing IRID M3 or K2 nets an extra point here.
>Judy_Horn: AILNRTU L1 LITA +21 428
>Judy_Horn: AILNRTU --  -21 407
>Morris_Greenberg: IO L1 OI +8 470
#note After day 1, I was 4-4, -8, which means if every opponent spotted me one point per game, I would have had a truly mediocre start. Averaged 423 through those 8 games so I expected worse luck on day two, though my opponents averaged 424, so perhaps both scores would go down...
