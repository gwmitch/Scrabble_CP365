>Seth_Lipkin: ARV 8G VAR +12 12
>Morris_Greenberg: AACFKOP 7H FOP +17 17
#note I doubted myself of VARA being a word. Time to study again.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?DEEORT K4 OERsTED +72 84
>Morris_Greenberg: AACIJKV J10 AJIVA +24 41
#note Race to the S. This and J(O)CK 4J are pretty even.
>Seth_Lipkin: HRTWY 4J W.RTHY +38 122
>Morris_Greenberg: CCEEIKL O1 ICK. +39 80
#note I played ICKY against Seth twice this tournament.
>Seth_Lipkin: OOZ L10 ZOO +37 159
>Morris_Greenberg: CEEEILU 6J U.EIC +21 101
#note Maybe EE(K) 3M instead to open a bingo line?
>Seth_Lipkin: EEF M9 FEE +26 185
>Morris_Greenberg: EEILMNU 13J .INE +27 128
#note Gah, missed VIMEN, and VENUE for that matter. I was choosing between VINE and VENULE, but VENULE seemed too gutsy for my taste. Quackle likes VENULE, then VIMEN, then this.

>Morris_Greenberg: DELMNQU N6 .LUED +37 165
>Seth_Lipkin: ANOSX 15F AXONS +52 251
#note And the race to the S was won.
>Morris_Greenberg: ALMNOQS 14F MON +32 197
#note I preferred keeping the L over the N since LOX is a word.
>Seth_Lipkin: BI N1 BI +26 277
>Morris_Greenberg: AAEELQS 13E AAL +20 217
#note After the game, we agreed keeping the A may have been better, considering I need to bingo to win, and an AAL lane is a lot worse than an AL lane for bingoing. Quackle still likes this a bit more, but that's likely due to error.
>Seth_Lipkin: ATT O7 ATT +23 300
>Morris_Greenberg: EELNQSS 12I Q. +11 228
#note Either this or exchange.
>Seth_Lipkin: GHU 14M HUG +19 319
>Morris_Greenberg: EEILNSS 2L S... +8 236
#note Quackle suggest I take out the O12 spot with LEGS, ENGS, NEGS, SINGE, or SENGI. I wish I could think like Quackle sometimes.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?IRRSUW O12 WI.S +36 355
#note I believe that was Seth's rack.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEILNRS 12D EL +6 242
#note Maybe RE or NE 9H or (FA)RE or (FA)NE H7 instead?
>Seth_Lipkin: ?AIMRRU 11A MURRAIn +74 429
>Morris_Greenberg: EEILNRS -  +0 242
#note Ah what a beautiful play mister Lipkin made, killing all of my hopes and dreams on the Scrabble board at once. I am going to challenge this out of spite!

Perhaps Seth will be so intimidated by my word knowledge that he takes off the word without going to the challenge computer. Perhaps the computer has a glitch and returns the play as unacceptable. Or perhaps there's a fifth U in the game and Seth plays UM to block the triple-triple next turn and I slap down REL(UM)INES. The possibilities are endless.
>Seth_Lipkin: BNNY B10 B.NNY +32 461
#note Silly rabbit. Let Seth win without giving him tons of extra spread points. That fifth U plan was flimsy at best.
>Morris_Greenberg: EEILNRS C8 LIE. +9 251
#note I refuse to give up going for the bingo.
