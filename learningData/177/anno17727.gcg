#note What do I do knowing Tobey will probably fire a bingo next turn? He's been taking a while. I guess this is fine
>Tobey_Roland: ?HILRST 5C SLITHeR +72 82
#note He had a 2x2 and a better SLITHeR
>Josh: ADEINOR H4 O. +2 66
#note Oh hey 472 8, we meet again. So now I've missed ANEROID and ANEROID+D. I took like 6 minutes on this turn. I considered (UP)O but I felt O(e) took out a scoring spot and opened a better lane for me. This turn probably cost me 50 points at the least. 
>Tobey_Roland: EEEINR L3 NEE.IER +18 100
>Josh: ADEINNR C3 IN.NARED +72 138
#note This or IN(L)ANDER? It seemed the latter gave back more but that's probably untrue.

#note I think I need to hold on to my S here and play this, right?

#note Oy, N7 V(U)LVA. 
>Tobey_Roland: INQ N7 Q.IN +15 209
>Josh: ?CGILOS 11K COGS +28 226
#note I didn't even look for 8s here I don't think. This is so sloppy. I considered this and LOGICS after looking without finding 7s. Even though this might still be the correct play I NEED TO SEE THINGS.

#note didn't like that spot getting left alone

>Josh: ?EEGILL D1 LE.E. +22 254
#note Crazy equity-whoring play. Whatever, Quackle would play this -_-

#note Hah. What is that, bingo number 4 missed? 
>Tobey_Roland: AAA A7 A.A +6 301
>Josh: ?EEGOPR 13E PROtEGE +64 363
#note I found the only thing! I guess this can still lose to some C sticks or SCOOTED or something else I don't see. 
>Tobey_Roland: ACEOSTT 12D COAT +20 321
#note -8 to COTTAE or COSTAE 14A.

#note Two terrible games to start the day off is always the best way to cash in division 1.
