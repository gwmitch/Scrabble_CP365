>Matt_Canik: ?ADELMO L8 .LAlOMED +74 74
#note I saw sOM(E)DEAL like 2 seconds after I hit my clock, despite spending almost 3 minutes looking for the best choice. I chose this over MELODIAS to create two scoring places- 15 and M.

#note Oof. WARM M10 is the play here for sure. I overlook MM so often =\
>Robin_Lewis: EEIRV 11H REVI.E +16 147
>Matt_Canik: ACHMRSU N10 CRUSH +41 191
#note (Y)U(C)CH is 38, HA(E)MS is 51. Yeesh.

#note This was another really hard turn. YUCA gives up the S, yeah, but everything else sucks. It's still pretty hard to bingo with that S, just get some points. This keeps the M which will be important for O12. (J)AY just gets hit with a big counter play.

Should I play AY O14 for 20 instead? 
>Robin_Lewis: EEILNST O2 LISENTE +85 258
#note Well that was inconvenient...

>Matt_Canik: BDDNOQY -BDNOQY +0 258
#note I've got to exchange here. Plays along 6 allow easy points for Robin. I hold the D because there's only one less (unlikely for me to double it up, *cough*) and it scores more than the N. I want to trade 6 to get more shots at the blank. 
>Robin_Lewis: FG K10 F.G +15 299
>Matt_Canik: ADDFIOR N6 IF +20 278
#note Do I need to open? Do I need to play more tiles?
>Robin_Lewis: EHNORT 12C THRONE +23 322
>Matt_Canik: ABDOORR 6C BROOD +21 299
#note Plays off tiles, gets some points, and allows little back for Robin. 
>Robin_Lewis: EENY 10F EYEN +14 336
>Matt_Canik: ADDIINU E11 D.UID +14 313
#note 3 paths to victory for me now: 
1. Bingo
2. Stick her with the Q
3. Q-bomb for 50+. 

3 is pretty unlikely, 2 will still require more help. I'll pick option 1. 
>Robin_Lewis: EEEGQTT D5 G.EET +7 343
#note A good play by Robin to stop my bingos and get many draws for an A or an I. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AILNRS F5 N.. +6 319
#note No wins here. I spent forever looking for something but couldn't work anything out, then suddenly I had 9 seconds and just played this.
