>Chris: AAEGNRV 8D GRAVEN +24 24
#note I'm going to eventually upload all my games from Oregon Tile and Montreal but I'm slow at annotating so it might take a while considering I still have 27 to do lol...

No idea how I missed VEGAN and GANEV; uncharacteristic mistake by me but it was the first move of the tourney so I'll forgive myself... maybe *takes out whips for self-flagellation*
>Kristiina: ATTY E8 .ATTY +16 16
>Chris: AAALMRU -AAALM +0 24
#note Change 5, didn't record rack
>Kristiina: ADNOOSU -ADNOOSU +0 16
#note Exch 5.
>Chris: ?CEENUW 12D W.E +18 42
#note I usually take the points but here I went for the fishier option D12 W(Y)E over A12 WEEN(Y) for 30. They're simming within 0.3% of each other at 70ish % to win. I think I just wanted to get a bingo down since this was the first game of the tourney. 
>Kristiina: EGLO G5 GLO.E +11 27
#note Please keep scoring 11 points and stuff kthx :)
>Chris: ?CDENOU I6 DE.OUNCe +62 104
#note Well, I chickened out on ENOUNCED even though I remember thinking that it's 90% probably good. I really just wanted to get a bingo down for sure to start the tournament lol :(
>Kristiina: DEEJ 14F JEED +40 67
>Chris: BEEIORZ 10B BOR.Z +42 146
#note Thought of COZIE or COZIER but I wanted to keep the board closed with the lead and especially against Kristiina, who seems to be an open board player. COZIE is simming way better than BORTZ though so maybe the equity sacrifice is too much?
>Kristiina: AORV B10 .RAVO +20 87
>Chris: EEIPQSU J10 PE +22 168
#note Thought of (E)QUIP I13 and PE J10. Didn't think of PIQUE J2, which is winning the sim. Rejected EQUIP because I thought after PE and a subsequent Q play on the K column, I could shut down the board and secure the win more easily. I think P(E)E H13 is a more direct and better way to do that, though. 
>Kristiina: AANNS 12I .ANNAS +21 108
#note Obviously she has another S but this looks like a weird play; i would think it's better to hold it here and not telegraph considering I can block the best S hook (UPS) next turn if I want and leave her with few options.
>Chris: EEIIQSU M10 QU.I +26 194
#note Thought of VIE B13 to keep my great leave, QUAI M10 and QIS N10. With this score and board shape, defense is at a premium, so I went with QUAI. The leave after QI(S) is too horrible to justify playing it for 6 more points. 
>Kristiina: ILNY 14K INLY +28 136
>Chris: EEIILST 13B .IE +17 211
#note Now VIE is the obv play.
>Kristiina: CFINSU K5 FUCINS +27 163
>Kristiina: CFINSU --  -27 136
#note Yay free turns and an unblocked bingo spot! This was pretty fortunate lol.
>Chris: EILRSST K4 RELISTS +69 280
>Kristiina: CFU 4I CU.F +18 154
#note Cool play by Kristiina. I was blind to the SCURF hook until she played it
>Chris: DEFKOTX 15F OFT +38 318
#note Scored as 37
>Kristiina: ADIIN D3 AIDIN. +16 170
>Chris: DEHIKMX C3 KHI +40 358
#note Missed SHEIK and SKIED K8, but KHI is equivalent (and 100% win according to Q with 24 tiles remaining lol)
>Kristiina: AEIP 8K .EPIA +24 194
>Chris: ADEEHMX 7N HM +16 374
#note Overly defensive here; should go for spread instead. Didn't see EXH(U)ME J1 for 46, although it does open a 3x3 lane. I'd play EX N15 if i could do this turn over.
>Kristiina: AGOS H1 GOAS +29 223
>Chris: ABDEEUX 2G D.UX +28 402
#note Thought I was being overly defensive here too but AXE B5 gives up too many points just for spread purposes 
>Kristiina: ?IOORT 1J OcTROI +27 250
>Chris: ABEELRT 9N ET +13 415
#note Should've played ABLER B4 but missed her other WHIM spot so thought this was better
>Kristiina: MW 4B W..M +12 262
>Kristiina:  (ABELR) +14 276
