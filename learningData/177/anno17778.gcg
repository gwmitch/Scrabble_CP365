>Chris: AAACEEE -AAEE +0 0
#note Should I keep CE, AC, or just E instead here?
>Seth: ANOTY 8H ATONY +24 24
>Chris: ABCENST 7J NAB +16 16
#note Considered BANT(Y) and this. Missed BAN(N)ETS for 36 somehow, which I would've played. The highest simming play though is BY for 7 keeping ACENTS. That kind of play usually isn't my style unless the board is crazily open, but meh. I like this better than BANTY for defense and leave purposes but this isn't a great play overall. 
>Seth: HILLZ H4 ZILL.H +28 52
#note 7L BA and 7L AB both sim 2% better than this. 16 seemed like a more 'solid' score than 12; I need to stop caring as much about what feels comfortable and just make the best plays. ACENT is a much better and less volatile leave than ACET. This is slightly better defensively at least.
>Chris: CESTTUW 10F WEST +34 50
#note Didn't consider the fishier options and played this quite fast, but J7 (NO)WT for 9 and 9K TEW are simming equivalent with my play. I'm happy with taking the points here, I think. If I fish and miss and he hits the Z for 30+ this could turn ugly in a hurry.
>Seth: AEOUV 4H .OUAVE +36 88
>Chris: AACIJNT I3 J.TA +23 73
>Seth: FO J2 FO. +23 111
>Chris: ?ACIMNU 9H .UM +18 91
#note Sets up the C as well as being the best play anyway. The setup comes back to bite me though...
>Seth: DG K3 G.D +21 132
>Chris: ?AACINT N4 sATANIC +84 175
#note This puts me firmly in control on a very closed board. Usually I convert these situations; let's see if I can do it once more hehe
>Seth: GNU O7 GUN +23 155
#note Annoying but semi-expected block of M9. Was hoping he'd play on row 11 to try to open and leave it unmolested.
>Chris: EEGINQR -Q +0 175
#note I autopiloted here and snap exchanged the Q when I maybe should not have. FEIGN/FEEING are probably better since points and scoring spots are at such a premium on this board. I guess I was hoping again that he'd open on row 11 and I could bingo with my EEGINR leave but his best play may very well be from the F at J2 to force me to open there to score anything with a tied score. 
>Seth: DEIIKRS -KIIDERS +0 155
#note Exch. 3
>Chris: EEEGINR 2J .EEING +26 201
#note Having not drawn a bingo last turn, I play what I probably should have before lol.
>Seth: AAIR 1L RAIA +31 186
#note Nice fit by Seth here.
>Chris: CDEKLRR G9 C.L +22 223
#note Huge mistake here, ceding my control of the game to Seth. I really wanted to play CRE(W) for 9 at F7 to shut down row 11 and row 7 to the L simultaneously, but after Seth scored so much with RAIA, I was concerned about getting outscored if I scored 9 and left 4 consonants. I was especially worried about A8 plays to the R after CREW for some reason. But I don't have any hooks for CEL and even if he doesn't bingo right away, he might get multiple chances at the spot, which makes this even worse.
>Seth: DDEEIRS 12A DERIDES +78 264
#note Seth decides to take the points. I might have played DESIRED for defense but I think it's close. Q likes DERIDES by 5%.
>Chris: EKORRRU A12 .REK +27 250
#note No idea why I missed DORK other than tilt from throwing away control of the game. 
>Seth: EQRU B10 QU.ER +74 338
#note DORK would've prevented this too :(
>Chris: EINORRV 10F ....ERN +20 270
#note Pretty much threw in the towel here but VIRION D9 is a nice play in that it sets up a hard to block S hook and fishes for the S while keeping ER. 2.5% vs 1.4% for WESTERN. My play saves some spread but RENVOI C5 is the best play for that purpose. 13D NOR is also a play that at least tries to win the game. 
>Seth: EEP 11D PEE. +28 366
#note GG pretty much.
>Chris: EIIORTV C9 OI +14 284
#note Let's see if Seth blocks my new lane
>Seth: DIPT 8A DIPT +29 395
#note He slotted a D at A8 though! Comeback time?
>Chris: EFILRTV 9M F.. +10 294
#note Q says to get rid of the T as well with M5 FAT, which makes sense with the bingo lanes available ending in D and T and the corresponding antisynergies. 
>Seth: OOW A5 WOO. +8 403
#note Blocking the most dangerous bingo lane, but a strange play given that the X is still out. 
>Chris: ?EILRTV 14A ..VIL +8 302
#note Drew the blank! Q says WIVER 5A wins 4.78% of the time but I don't see how. I don't think this scores enough though so I think I'm just screwed anyway.
>Seth: ABHMOS 15E ABOHMS +41 444
#note He was concerned about the X going at J14 so he tacked on the S. ABMHO wouldve accomplished the same thing but he's won the game anyway.
>Chris: ?EORSTX B2 REdOX +84 386
#note Missed vORTEX and cORTEX for 86 but both of them would've given him nice outplays. It turns out that if he had screwed up and played ABOHM, I would have had EXTORtS for 131 and would have won 445-441!
>Seth: IY 6A ..Y +13 457
>Chris: ST 3A S.T +6 392
#note As Josh Waitzkin says in his Chessmaster tutorials, don't make the second mistake. CEL cost me the advantage but carelessly playing DREK afterwards because I was tilted likely cost me the game. 
>Chris:  (I) +2 394
