>JD: ABDEGMR F7 GAMB +23 23
#note interesting quackle says I misread this one. I thought I was being relatively defensive, but by playing at 7H I block all the 8s lanes, just leave 7s and drop his bingo percentage from 20% to ~14%.

#note it's pretty close with exchanging, but I figured if I played through I would probably get to score with CH.
>Jim_Burlant: AAL E9 AAL +14 108
>JD: CEEHIPU 14A UP +18 143
#note quackle says I am getting a little too attached to CH. In fact, I bingo 17% of the time with CEEIP and 7% with CEEHI. That's a lot, but I can believe t.

#note his actual rack, he was trying to get a new lane open

#note I believe this was his actual rack. I might've played AX at C6 trying to create extra volatility.
>JD: CEEIKNU L12 K.EE +18 244
#note I felt like this was the most important move of the game. After XI he was indicating a huge leave. Quackle likes EEK at 10J since it doesn't give back the triple and accomplishes the same goal of blocking BRITHS and the E, but I wonder if KNEE might make it harder for jim to open.
