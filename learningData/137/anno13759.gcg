#note if I exchange U I can hit SENOPIA, PAISANO, SINOPIA and lots of consonants...the exchange didn't occur to me but I think it would be best
>Ed: DLOT 7J TOLD +9 9
>JD: AAEGINS I8 .AGANISE +63 73
#note I saw the 2x2 for AGONISE and I almost thought about chickening out of this play! Ed held

>JD: AILLQTT 15H T.LL +18 167
#note that spot at 15H is worth so much that I have to block! I really should've played long, keeping QAT is not a big deal with 3 Us out there.

>JD: AAFHIQT E10 QAT +26 193
#note yuck, why didn't I see FAQIR here! this is worse
>Ed: EP 5J PE. +14 128
>JD: AFHIKVZ 13G KH. +32 225
#note unexpectedly VIA at F9 sims .5 better than KHI, being a few points better on defense and then scoring a whole 10 points per turn more next turn. weird! I don't get it, but I think it's probably because I have such a good chance of drawing ZEK at M3 next turn.

#note nice play ed! ed said he wasn't totally sure of this being good
>JD: ABFIVWZ F9 FIB +27 252

>JD: AHIRVWZ 1K HA.IZ +63 315
#note I had RAYAH at the bottom-left for a lot of points and debated just playing FIZ to keep that play, but that would've been silly.
>Ed: AEN 9H N.E +8 197
>JD: DNRRUVW 11K V.W +18 333
#note : ( I saw VANWARD but thought that it might take an S, and given how far up I am at this point, giving him a big S hook seemed like the only way I could lose the game.

>JD: MORRTVW 3B VROW +44 506
#note he's basically guaranteed to bingo unless I draw the blank or the D, and there's no point in me blocking with something like WOVEN because he still has row 7.
