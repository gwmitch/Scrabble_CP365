#note whoa! I think he underscored this as 102 instead of 128 for some reason
>JD: DEMNTYY 12I MY +21 41
#note this is kind of a weird play but I figured I needed to bingo ASAP so I would keep the best leave available...but quackle's suggestion of EMYD at K11 might be better

>JD: ELLUVVW 13M V.W +18 239
#note uh that wasn't the draw I was hoping for. I like quackle's suggestion of LUV trying to draw for VOWEL/MELL
>Kevin_Rickhoff: NOR 1L .ORN +18 444
>JD: ELLOSUV N9 ......S +18 257
#note well, this play is completely ridiculous, but I figured that I was up on the field by a ton of spread so I might as well take a shot at LEVULOSE 3x3 and NOUVELLE for at least some figment of a chance of winning.
>Kevin_Rickhoff: ADEILRT 15H LARDIE.T +140 584
#note oh no!
>JD: ELLOOUV 14M O. +8 265
#note I mean, what else am I supposed to do, play KOLO or LOUR? uhh...yeah probably, with an S unseen he will just block column O
>Kevin_Rickhoff: BNOSU O5 BONUS +27 611
>JD: EELLOUV 10D V.. +9 274
#note well, I finally drew nouvelle...just in time. quackle seems to like LO at G10 saving VELUM

#note best

>JD: EIL 2B LIE +8 291
#note I lost 10 on time, if he plays ZA last turn and doesn't underscore MESQUITE he would have 642-285!
