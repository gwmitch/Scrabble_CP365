#note wow
>Mike_Baker: GQU J6 QU.G +34 34
>JD: DEEGIMO 7M MOG +18 118
#note I wanted to start shutting down the board, starting with the S at N1. Quackle doesn't like it on a sim (after all, the other S is still available) but I think I need to play this rather than MODI or GIZMO. However quackle finds one play I like better - GIE at 9M which scores much better next turn and accomplishes the same goals.

>JD: DEEEILN H8 .ELENIDE +77 195
#note well, if you get lucky it doesn't matter if you keep a better leave. before he played ZORIL I had a gorgeous 9 lined up! can you find it? Then I realized I had another bingo anyway.

>JD: ADNOOTV 11J VO.D +19 258
#note I looked for a long time and couldn't find anything better, but I think I should've played VODOU here.
>Mike_Baker: DEENOST F6 DENOTE.S +65 169
>Mike_Baker: DEENOST --  -65 104
#note took me a minute to challenge this...but I know ERODENT is the only one in there
>JD: AENORST 15A RESONAT. +77 335
#note yikes! I did not spot RESONATE at 11A, which, given his rack, is actually safe. In fact, this play gives him DENOTED at 14B for 40 points!
>Mike_Baker: DEENOST 11C DONE +21 125
#note fortunately for me he didn't see it

>Mike_Baker: EHIST 14F HI. +30 155
>JD: ?ADEPUW 6L DAW +34 391
#note I seemed more likely to hut the D at 11C after DAW
>Mike_Baker: EHMORST F4 SMOTHER.. +68 223
#note nice play mike
>JD: ?AEPTUY N13 PYA +32 423
#note quackle points out that PYE is more likely to bingo next turn with all the Es left (that's the case A). maybe I even have a shot at column A if I keep the A.
>Mike_Baker: OOW L3 WOO. +16 239
>JD: ?ELNTTU C4 UNTiTLE. +59 482
#note I wussed out on UNLETTED, wish I hadn't because he might've challenged
>Mike_Baker: BIIKSTU 8A BI. +15 254
>JD: BEEFIRX M3 EX +37 519
>Mike_Baker: CTU D2 CUT +14 268
>JD: BEFIKRS 1A BRISK +43 562
#note this is an interesting position for me here. I could not figure out the championship player results at all...until I realized that, if the E is in the bag, he has RIPIENI at G1 and I'm supposed to block! Otherwise, I am pretty sure this would be the best play.
>Mike_Baker: EIIINPR O1 PIERIN. +41 309
#note however, mike misses RIPIENI! If I don't think he'll see it, I should just go ahead and play BRISK. but then, me leaving this phony on the board costs me 56 points of spread!!!
