#note Missed GYM, though it keeps an ugly leave, especially with an as yet vowel-free board.

#note I don't see a good reason to play PLAID. PADRI is not a bad option though. PARDI is interesting, gambling that he doesn't know the E hook, but that's a bit too much of a gamble for my taste.

#note I missed OKRA B11. It's a risky play, but it scores well and keeps a strong leave. I suppose it's worth it. I chose this over ORATED because I wanted a more open board, though perhaps ORATED is fine because it does score 3 more and it's quite easy to play from H11 whenever I please.
