#note tried to get cute on this play but the best is to cover the obvious spot with LIAR even thugh the leave isn't so great. and it would've prevented the following sequence of events...
>Roy_Kamen: IQ 1F QI +27 184
>JD: ACDIORR 5C OR +13 216
#note this was the problem with my last play...a lot of the bingos I draw with my nice leave won't play. I also failed to identify another high-risk spot...
>Roy_Kamen: EESY H1 S.EE.Y +66 250
#note yikes!! in retrospect I wonder if I could've forecasted all this in the first place since that was the best Q spot on the board...but roy said he didn't have the S when he played QI.

#note no spot for PERACID and I really thought this had a good chance of being good...nice challenge
>Roy_Kamen: FGIT 7C GIFT +24 274
>JD: ACDEIPR 9K .AD +11 227
#note I'm in pretty bad shape at this point. Quackle likes YIP, but I thought that after YIP he'd be able to play on row 11 and block my lane from the S as well.
>Roy_Kamen: DEINV N6 VINED +26 300
>JD: CEIOPRU 8A UPO +18 245
#note I would rather not block the C at A1 but this is too much better than everything else

#note this is phony. I actually thought this was good, but it would probably be a gamble worth taking anyway

#note totally whiffed on the best play of OZALID, the pool is so good that I should have no fear of digging into the bag with my rack. big miss
