#note Tempting but risky. the T hook + open ERS really add value to this play.
>JAD: ACIJNOR 14B CO. +28 183
#note jd: at the time it felt like I had to do something to mitigate this spot. That said, by playing COZ instead of RAJ I drop my bingo percentage next turn from 48% to 3%!!! this suggests that I should just dump the J, get on with my business and hope that I don't get burned too badly, even though I think I want to start minimizing volatility at this point.
>KR: ADEINTU K2 AUDIENT +78 237
#note (R)UINATED is better here. Kevin had it spelled out, but I guess opted for defense. The defense seems like an illusion to me, personally.

#note Finding a bingo here puts Kevin in fantastic shape...jd: yeah, I dodged a bullet. What a game so far!
>JAD: CEHNRRT I7 R.TRENCH +68 353
#note jd: this is a huge deal since it makes the blanks less dangerous and takes out the best lane
>KR: ?AMRSUX H14 AX +32 358
#note Kevin put down MU first - telegraphs a strong leave, which means he likely has a ? here.
>JAD: BEHIILU N10 HUB +35 388
#note HILI in the same spot maybe?
>KR: ?AMORSU J6 MU. +24 382
#note Tacking on the A here seems like a good idea.

#note QI(N)DAR looks like the favorite here. This is 2nd best, but those extra shots at a blank seem really helpful here, as Jesse isn't going to outrun Kevin without a blank.  JD: it took me a while to agree with this assessment..drawing a blank would be good, sure. but I spent about 5 minutes looking at this board, and to me the only really threatening easy scoring spot was the F at F10, and I wanted to make sure to shut it down. but I guess I didn't realize that QINDAR also kills the possibility of FOE at that spot as well. That said, I also think I can win this game at this point without drawing a blank.
>KR: ?ALOORS M11 OAR +14 429
#note I don't like this play. F7 L(O)OS keeps some pace and (C)OLORS goes for the other blank, which seems pretty crucial for Jesse's winning chances.
>JAD: ?EEGIRV E1 VEG +17 468
#note I was going to just play REV for better tempo, but the G promised to be hard to play off.
>KR: ?FLMOST 10G FO.M +15 444
>JAD: ?EEEGIR H1 ERE +27 495
#note All of Kevin's outs are at K10, but Jesse has the tournament won.
