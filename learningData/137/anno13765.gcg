>ESD: CEEKLOS 8H OKE +14 14
#note Round 20 of Vegas. ELS > CELS so COKE is better here, but CLEEK scores too many points to pass up here. (all commentary by conrad unless otherwise indicated)
>JAD: ABDEESV J6 VE. +14 14
#note Of course, CLEEK would've given JD BES(L)AVED!
>ESD: CEILNSX H3 LEXIC.NS +68 82

>JAD: ?DEIMNR --  -72 94
#note jd: OMG THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PLAYS I HAVE EVER MADE IN SCRABBLE. I had REMIND? lined up on my rack and didn't see the spot. and I didn't even see that ENDERMIC played. sigh.
>ESD: EGIILRY 1A GEY +30 155
#note Not much Ed can do to stop REMINDs, with eNDERMI(C) still available.

>ESD: AAEIILO G9 AIOLI +12 197
#note lots of ugly options here.
>JAD: ADEELRU I7 U.E +19 235
#note This time Ed gives him the L, but Jesse made a rare very quick play, perhaps not considering the L.  JD: LAURELED looks totally unfamiliar...evidently I haven't seen that alphagram in two years and it's not in my cardbox. oh well.
>ESD: AAEINSU 6J .AU +6 203
>JAD: ADEFHLR H13 FEH +32 267
#note jd: tough choice between taking the points at 1H and trying to interfere with Ed bingoing (he just signaled a very strong leave).
>ESD: ACEINNS L5 N.ISANCE +72 275
>JAD: ?ADLPRW O2 .PRAWLeD +89 356
#note JD: of course, I get lucky in spite of playing like a moron earlier
>ESD: ABGHOPT F9 PHT +38 313
#note Maybe better to dump the O off here, too with TOPH.
>JAD: DGJOSTY N8 DOGY +18 374
#note Conrad: Right word, wrong spot - M12  JD: yeah, blocking some of the bingoes from the H would've been really nice. After the debacle earlier I was actually on the verge of chickening out of DOGY entirely.
>ESD: ABEGNOT 1E BANG +31 344
>JAD: EJLOOST M11 OLEO +18 392
#note Conrad: O11 OLEO is interesting...maybe OOT here to save a vowelless nightmare scenario.  JD: I like this play after he blocks JO. I spent about 6 minutes here evaluating the possibilities...I block HATTERIA, THEREFOR and THEORITE, and I also block AZURE which looks reasonably possible. I didn't consider OLEO at O11, not sure if that placement is better.
>ESD: EEIOORT N2 .OE +10 354
>JAD: AJSTTUZ 14J JAT.S +56 448
#note Conrad: Would still lose to FORTIET(H). Jesse should block the H here.  Jesse: I looked at the pool for about 5 minutes for available bingoes through the H after JATOS, and I didn't see anything. With about a minute left on my clock, I decided to just take the points instead of paranoid-blocking the H because I wasn't sure if there might be some other way I could lose. For what it's worth, FORTIETH is a 1/60 rack from my perspective in a void (given the actual pool, Ed had a 1/10 chance of drawing FORTIETH). I guess THUJA is the play.
>ESD: AEIORTT 15G T.IO +16 370
#note Ed almost got the outbingo! :( T(H)ROE here is 11 better but Ed is out of time. Irrelevant from here on out.
>JAD: FRTUWZ 9K Z. +11 459
#note JesseL: ZA at K13 is better because it doesn't give him a play at 10K
>ESD: AERT 10J TA. +16 386
#note Jesse: RIFE at 13F blocks my best play and saves TAN
>JAD: FRTUW 13G ..F +13 472
#note Jesse: TIFF or RIFF are both 7 better because they present RIFF/RE
>ESD: ER I11 RE. +6 392
