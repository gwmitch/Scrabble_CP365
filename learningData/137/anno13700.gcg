#note Vegas 2/13 Round 2 SamK versus Jesse Day. (all commentary by conrad unless otherwise noted)
>Sam: AAENPRT -A +0 0
>JD: ?AABEIN 8B IkEBANA +68 68
#note conrad: 8C ABElIAN is best, but possible Jesse wanted to minimize Sam's comeback potential...? jd: naw, just missed it, but with his rack of AENPRT after his fish they sim very close to even since I don't hang an E in the 2x2 lane...it's probably a close decision
>Sam: AELNPRT B3 TRAPL.NE +68 68
#note (I)NTERLAP scores more, and is definitely worth playing here.
>JD: DEIIILO E6 LI.IDO +18 86
#note A nice save with an awful rack.

#note Sam opts for points over leave here, which sims evenly with the other top plays.

>Sam: EHLPRSU 11J HUP +21 152
#note Missing PLUSHER. This also blocks his main line

>JD: ?FINSYZ F12 .IZY +36 341
#note conrad: 10 points back of 7D F(I)Z. jd: wow, I am surprised. I think I passed up FIZ on purpose for some reason. I bingo 62% of the time after FIZ and just 42% after SIZY...the vowel helps and SIZY also kind of blocks my lane. That said I only have it as a 6 point difference.

#note conrad: Second best to the only bingo, rEFAS(HI)ON! And even then, a small mistake. jd: I spent a long time looking! but REFASHION is pretty damn hard to see
>Sam: DEKLORS 10H .OK +40 221
>JD: ?BEGNST 14H BESTiNG +76 437
#note conrad: If you find the other playable bingo here, you go get a cookie for yourself right now. jd: LOL
>Sam: DELOORS 15L DOOR +30 251
>JD: CEFMQUW -CFQUW +0 437
#note conrad: Quackle offers so little in the way of plays here, that I like this one  jd: I was looking at the pool and it seemed like there would never be a good place to play the Q and dump the rest of my garbage, so I might as well dump it now.
>Sam: AEELSTU 2H ELUATES +73 324
>JD: EILMNRT 9D M.L +11 448
#note conrad: maybe MIL at 1M? Jesse is at 20 seconds after this play. jd: I was hoping to bingo over there, and I figured if he had drawn the Q he might not get the chance to block.
>Sam: AFGIQUW K2 .QUA +26 350
#note 1M plays block Jesse's potential outbingos.
