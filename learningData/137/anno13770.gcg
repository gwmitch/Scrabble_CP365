#note since I have the case A, why not play UH now to dump the ungainly U and save the A for next turn?

>JD: IINRTUY B7 RUIN +9 429
#note oh god, I tanked the hell out of this endgame. I had about 5 minutes to figure everything out, and I saw RUTIN at N7, and even figured out that I had ICY and YIP both available, but I was worried that I might have missed a play at O8 that would give her too many points even though I checked my tracking. but instead I made a play that supposedly loses...
>Maddy_Kamen: DELOORT 13C .OLD +20 417
#note I thought I was playing it safe by putting a U at 8B but instead I now allow Maddy to block my best play with CORVET at F2 followed by DOL/DEAVED next turn for a 2 point win! thank goodness she didn't find that sequence
