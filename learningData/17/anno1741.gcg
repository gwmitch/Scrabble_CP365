>Magrathean: ADEEHLR 8D HEARD +26 26
#note wow. Surprised that my play, HEARD, doesn't win this one, but the ER is evidently that much better than EL. Actually, it looks like 1.5 of it is due to hanging an E in the double-double lane. This still surprises me. 2/2
>Quacklissimus: AEKORTU 8A OUT..... +36 36
>Magrathean: EEFILMN F3 FILEN.ME +67 93
#note bingo! and the right one, too. 0/2
>Quacklissimus: AEGIKRS E4 KA +22 58
>Magrathean: INOPSUZ D1 ZIPS +64 157
#note this one ain't too hard either. 0/2
>Quacklissimus: EGIIRSX 7B XI +22 80
>Magrathean: DIINOUW E10 WUD +19 176
#note A tough move where I thought I'd made an ok choice. the other competitors are WINO, WOUND and WIZ. Of those, I like WIZ the best - WOUND is way too volatile, and WINO leads to too many disaster racks and allows an S hook, though I suppose that's a minor factor. Also might be misjudging IINO versus DIU. 3/5
>Quacklissimus: CEGIRST 1A RIT. +39 119
>Magrathean: IINOPTY 12A PYOI. +28 204
#note best. 0/5
>Quacklissimus: CDEFGRS C11 F.G +14 133
>Magrathean: ?INOQTT -Q +0 204
#note interesting. I seem to be having a lot of Q issues...I guess it's just hard to know what to do with it a lot of the time, but here my choice sims OK. The best is clearly xQT, which might be kinda obvious...I simply saw a lot of bingos I could hit with a one tile draw and I didn't want a second chance at drawing a disaster tile. This is probably the turning point in the game. 5/10
>Quacklissimus: CDEERRS G2 CEDER +29 162
>Magrathean: ?BINOTT 6C BIT.. +19 223
#note so much for the one tiler. could;'ve had dotation or intorted, or dittoing which I didn't see the turn before. but quackle seems to like my play. 0/10
>Quacklissimus: GGINRSU 14C SURGING +71 233
>Magrathean: ?ABNOST G8 .OB +19 242
#note uggh. this one makes me sick to look at. must've gone through bonitas and bastion fifty times and wondered if surgings was good without hitting the third anagram. I'm gonna be sick if this happens at nationals. quackle actually likes BOAT way better than ROB anyway - have to play somewhere on the bottom in order for that to be a volatile area and not give the triple to him quite so easily. 28/38
>Quacklissimus: ACEOSTV 15I OCTAVES +92 325
>Magrathean: ?ANRSTT O8 TRANSiT. +74 316
#note thought about CONTRAST for volatility/maybe to set up CONTRASTY, but it gives back too much. I missed TARTNESS here too, probably flustered by frickin' OCTAVES. but then again, this is gonna happen...better get used to it now. 1/39
>Quacklissimus: ?AAEILU C1 .AU +16 341
>Magrathean: AAEHLOQ N10 HAO +31 347
#note since there's no S out I play HAO to make it a little harder on him to bingo. 0/39
>Quacklissimus: ?AEIJLV L8 JAVELIn. +100 441
#note ouch
>Magrathean: ADEEELQ G13 Q. +21 368
#note they're all desperation plays at this point anyway, but QAT appears to cut the most spread. sure, why not. 5/43
>Quacklissimus: EELMOOO 2G .OELOME +13 454
>Magrathean: AADEEEL J1 A.LEE +5 373
#note ok, I tried to get too cute here by passing up points when doing so is a poor idea. ALEE  at 4L, which I saw but thought gave up too many big plays, leads to a few big endgames, specifically if the W or Y or drawn. The exact equity figures look like this: ALEE at 4.75, ALLEE at -.75 (calculated by actually going through each endgame - not always the same as championship player in the preendgame because that one uses slightly simpler code). So not a terrible miss, I suppose. 5.5/48.5
>Quacklissimus: INNNOWY H1 Y.W +36 490
>Magrathean: ADER L2 .ADRE +16 389
#note best again, ending up at 48.5 equity points lost. More mistakes this time - an early tricky strategic point, another small one on a tough strategy bit, a bad exchange (exchanges tend to be my achilles' heal), a bigtime miss on a missed bingo, and some preendgame stuff which wouldn't affect the end of the game too much.
