>orangejkel: BDFIINX 8H INFIX +46 46
>Brendan_Sullivan: EELNSTU 7E UNSTEEL +71 71
>orangejkel: BDIIORW 9K BID +22 68
#note I'd probably drop the I down for BIDI; ORW is workable. Then again, saving the I allows for the outside chance at (INFIX)ING.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AELMORY M9 .REAMY +24 95
#note I underestimate the bingo power of AELMR: 10M OY 16 sims quite well. I liked DREAMY since it cuts off (INFIX)ING, with me currently having none of the 3 letters required for it. But if I'm playing there, DORMY is better. Why didn't I see that? I've used it my whole life during golf matches. I guess I always think of it as DORMIE.
>orangejkel: AFIORTW N13 OAF +26 94
#note 12L WAIF 28 is better. OAF gives back some high-scoring overlaps.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ALNOOTU 8A TAUON +20 115
>orangejkel: IOQRTVW O11 VROW +25 119
#note There are some Q plays available, but it's probably smart to neutralize this hotspot.
>Brendan_Sullivan: GLNOOPT 9F LONG +17 132
#note 6K GLOP 20 seems to be best, but I'm not sure with SSS?? unseen. It does probably lead to a bingo fastest. Plus, PONG in the same spot is better than LONG.
>orangejkel: AGIIQST C7 Q.AG +25 144
#note Yikes, N8 QI 18 wins a 2-ply sim! I might think N6 QATS 40 is reasonable, holding II. Either one involves the willingness to risk a big comeback play. For the safer Q plays, QUAG is best, even with the II leave. QUIT gives an easy E hook and QUAI opens a huge X hotspot.
>Brendan_Sullivan: BELOPRT D10 ORB +13 145
#note Yuck, not so hot. I retain no hook letter, and it gives him the chance to play a 5 starting in A/E to cut the bingo lane thru the T in half. Best plays seem to be 10F OPT 19 or 12 L B(A) 8 or D8 (O)BOLE 21.
>orangejkel: EEIIRST E10 REI +18 162
>Brendan_Sullivan: EILPRTV F9 .EPT +25 170
#note Sure, ILRV isn't great, but there's a glut of vowels to be drawn. However, it would be nice to save the E and take (BID)E with a bingo; hence, 11J VILE/LIVE 14 sim best.
>orangejkel: AEIRSTT A1 RATTIES. +77 239
#note Or TARTIEST or TITRATES or TRISTATE.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ILNRTUV 11H VIRTU. +18 188
#note Right idea, but UNLIVE saves the more desirable RT.
>orangejkel: DGIMOWZ 2A .ZIDO +30 269
>Brendan_Sullivan: AHKLNSU 1E HUNK +38 226
#note ANKUSH plays for 48, but I still like saving the S. I'm going to need to bingo after this to make it close.
>orangejkel: EGHMOWY I1 YOW +28 297
#note This leaves E/L/S hooks wide open. Any of HOMY/WHY/WHEY hooking ORBY at 13D are much safer.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAAJLSS H11 .ASAL +27 253
#note I debated this one for a while. I didn't particularly want to keep the J with this board and the current score, but I don't have any way to score reasonably with it now without clogging up my own potential bingo lanes.
>orangejkel: DDEGHIM J2 HEM +34 331
#note Still might be unwise to leave an E/P/S hook wide open with ??EEEEEES unseen. 4E MIDGE 21 seems to be best, forcing me to start a 7 with S, or make an 8 on the bottom of the board, or hook BID which would give him a nice comeback on the TWS.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AJLNPS E6 J.. +10 263
#note With any 1 tile draw, I hit a bingo hooking BID, and might do better if he leaves the HEM hooks open.
>orangejkel: DDEEGII K3 DIE +19 350
#note 5H GIED 21 clogs things  up nicely.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AALNPS N3 NAPALmS +67 330
#note Somewhat surprisingly, bingoing here is a big mistake! N3 NAPALmS/PLAtANS and 5H cAP(E)LANS are showing less than 10% wins on a many-plyer. Meanwhile, H1 (K)NAP 27 and 4J (MI)LPA 18 are showing almost 80% wins! I guess that the bingos are worth so little, no matter what I draw from the bag, I will lose. Even the blank won't help much. I need to score this turn and hope to draw a better bingo.
>orangejkel: ?CDEEGI O1 CEE +17 367
#note Best is 4H DE(MI)C 34, setting up 5F GIEd 17 for the out. However, we both had only 1:00 left at this point.
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEEO D2 .ECO +14 344
#note Best is 4I E(MI)C 26.
>orangejkel: ?DGI 15G G.IDe +6 373
#note A tricky game the whole way. I don't know whether I'd be able to recognize such a late-game position where bingoing is a mistake.
>orangejkel:  (E) +2 375
