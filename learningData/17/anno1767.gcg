>Brendan_Sullivan: AEINNSW 8G NAW +12 12
#note Gives me the S hook without giving away too many other hooks for him (as WAN would).
>chaithedog: AABEOOT 9G ABO +20 20
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEINRSS H7 R..IDNESS +89 101
#note I already had ARIDNESS lined up, so this was played rather quickly.
>chaithedog: AEELOQT -  +0 20
#note Carl was in tournament preparation mode, which apparently makes him challenge happy.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEFHLLO 14B FELLAH. +30 131
#note I13 FOH 29 is a very close second.
>chaithedog: AEELOQT 15A QAT +43 63
>Brendan_Sullivan: AGMNOOR 15H .ONOGRAM +89 220
#note ONDOGRAM also plays, but for much less.
>chaithedog: EEELMOS 13C LEE +16 79
#note 14M EME 24 scores better.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAACDGI 12H .AIAD +12 232
#note This was bad. 14J AGA 18 is best for valuation, but GADID/GADDI are slightly better on wins, cutting out the 2x2 lane.
>chaithedog: EIMOOSU 11K MEOU +23 102
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACDGITX 10N XI +50 282
>chaithedog: EINOSTW 14J OW +16 118
#note F2 TOWNIES/SNAW.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACCDGIT F6 CIG +20 302
#note O6 CACTI 27.
>chaithedog: EIJNOST O8 JO.ST +46 164
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACDENTV 10J VAT +23 325
#note 12D DEV 25 is a little better. J4 DAVEN 26 is fine, too, but why open the board any more with this kind of lead?
>chaithedog: EIIINOT 6B IONI. +9 173
#note Taking a chance that I don't have the B or P hook.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?CDENRT C1 CENTR.iD +70 395
#note C3 CREODONT or C2 CARTONED are worth 6 more and they don't needlessly open the 3x3.
>chaithedog: EEIKPTT 1A PI.KET +57 230
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEISUUY -IUUY +0 395
#note With a D or R draw, I can extend PICKET. 11I YAUD 16 is reasonable, too, with so many consonants left. I don't like 4A YETI; keeping the E is important with the highly-valuable extensions that are possible.
>chaithedog: EIPRRTU A6 PURTIER +90 320
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEEHSV 1A ......ED +51 446
>chaithedog: ?BGLNOY 11A .BONY +20 340
#note With the bag consisting of half vowels, 14N YO/BO 24 leaving BLGN?/GLNY? aren't as scary as they first seem, particularly since the Z is still out there.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEHSVZ 14N ZA +48 494
>chaithedog: ?EGLRUY C10 Y. +5 345
#note EGLRU? + 1 leads to plenty of bingos.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEFHISV 2G FEH +17 511
#note I saw that REGULUS played at 2G and J2. I did not, however, see 3A LONGUEUR. My play of FEH is best since it blocks all 3 bingos, but I was only defending against the first 2. Lucky me.
>chaithedog: ?EGLRUU L4 REGULa... +22 367
#note Best.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EISV 4A VE.S +22 533
#note Now I notice the possibility of a U stick. Unfortunately, I have a brain fart and believe that VETS will block UT and NU. Best move is 3B IN 2 forcing him to pass, followed by D13 ELS/QATS for 18 and 6J VEG 15 and out.
>chaithedog: U 3C .U +4 371
#note Duh. Silly me. Luckily, it didn't matter.
>chaithedog:  (I) +2 373
