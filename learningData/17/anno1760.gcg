#note Saw INTER(B)ED, but talked myself out of it, not being absolutely sure it was good. 
>Bob_Ellickson: MOOR H12 MOOR +37 61
#note Add the extra points Bob gets here on to the seven less I got for my bingo, and the mistake is a costly one.
>Steve_Grob: ACLSSTU 14H .UTCLASS +74 139
#note Happy to find this one, even though CUTLASS (which I didn't see or know) is far less dangerous.
>Bob_Ellickson: EKU 13M KUE +30 91
#note My eyes must have lit up after first seeing my rack, and then this play.
>Steve_Grob: ??ACELT O8 CLEAn..T +81 220
#note Next best thing to a 9-letter triple-triple, of which there are two. Spent five minutes trying to find one of them, to no avail.
>Bob_Ellickson: AEGILOR 10B REGIO.AL +63 154
#note Bob starts to hit back.
>Steve_Grob: ?HINORW K11 WIN.H +26 246
>Bob_Ellickson: AEEISTZ D10 .AZE +28 182
#note Bob mentioned this rack after the game. I believe I'm remembering it correctly, but he may have had an N rather than the I.
>Steve_Grob: ?EEJORU 15D JURO. +20 266
#note Same play at B6 is worth 8 more; Duck's next choice is J(E)U at 13C. I'm hoping to extend this play to the triple later in the game with NONjuror.
>Bob_Ellickson: AEINSTT L6 SATINET +75 257
#note Just like that, Bob is back in the game.
>Steve_Grob: ?EEFIRY K5 FEY +25 291
#note First missed bingo of the tournament, although the best play is foregoing the bingos and playing YE at 9C for 36. I felt I was missing something here, but didn't have much time to dally after having spent so much time on the CLEANEST play.

>Bob_Ellickson: DO N9 OD +19 331
>Steve_Grob: ?EINPRY 3B PINE.Y +30 360
#note YE and BEGAZE is still the best, and I'm still missing it. Also another missed bingo, albeit a cheapie.
>Bob_Ellickson: VX 13C V.X +26 357
>Steve_Grob: ?AFINRW 4A WIFe +37 397
#note Kudos if you found this missed bingo. I felt it was right at this point to ditch the blank for points and try to make it to the finish line.
>Bob_Ellickson: ADEGNV A4 .AVED +36 393
>Steve_Grob: AAHLNOR 2G ALOHA +21 418
#note Guarantees a win.

>Bob_Ellickson: GNST I13 N.S +22 415
>Steve_Grob: NR 11C R.N +12 430
#note I'm now an unexpected 3-1 heading into the lunch break on Day One of the 2008 NSC.
