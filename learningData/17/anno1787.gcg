#note My play sims 5th. B10 (C)OZIE 32 sims highest, but I passed on that when I saw it. I was scared of the other Ses, Rs and Ds still in the pool. 9F OI 9, B10 (C)OZIES 34 and Exchange II are the other options. I really don't know what's right here...help anyone?

#note Although my play is among the highest scoring, something smaller like 7J BU(M)F 15 or K6 FUB 16 sims higher. I saw both but passed on them...another move where I didn't know what was right/to do

#note Here's where I completely blew this game. UNPEN, as pretty much all of the rest of you knew, takes a T hook. I did not know this. I am expecting something like 14F QUATE 42 at the worst, which I can still beat.

#note Here she comes...
>Jesse_M: ?ILRSS -  +0 351
#note Knowing I can't win otherwise (and because I didn't know UNPENT at all), I challenge unsuccessfully
