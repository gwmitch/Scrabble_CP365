#note Sims best.  IVY 8H is only 0.2 behind.

#note Sim says this is 1.8 better than the 11J placement, which I never even noticed.

#note Gorgeous!

#note It's nice to have a few easy plays when you're hungover.

#note This rack described how I was feeling perfectly.  The duck prefers HUT in this spot by about four points.  I'm a little surprised that sims even better than HUG.  Is keeping ING really that strong?  I guess with the large number of E's to draw GINR is likely to be powerful.

#note It's usually a sign of impending big trouble when Johnny O makes plays like that.
>Dave: EEIORRT 4C RETRI. +27 133
#note Sim likes MOIRE for 11 points less keeping the nice ERT.  I cannot see myself ever making a move other than RETRIM in this situation.  After MOIRE the board is too blocked up, making bingos unlikely.  I need to open the left side of the board, and I'm happy to keep the L column open.  I also need as many points as possible, because even a bingo is not gonna be enough to catch me up.

>Dave: DEINOST 4J NOD +33 166
#note It's clear that I want to play some sort of overlap in this position, but it's very hard in these situations to decided whether to play more or fewer tiles.  OD of course gives me the greatest chance of bingoing, but again the issue is that I need a lot of points in addition to a bingo to catch up.  Interestingly, from a winning percentage point of view sim prefers playing even more tiles with NODI.  NODI, OD, and NOD are all within 2.4 of each other.  It makes much more sense to play the N given that there are four more unseen and only one unseen T.

#note A termite walks into a bar and says, "Is the bar tender here?"
>O'laugh: AANO F9 ANOA +14 282
#note Maybe the D9 placement is better, as it would partially block C column bingos while still taking out big X plays at F10.  It also would have prevented my next big play, but there was no real reason to be expecting it.

#note Once again Johnny O is stylin' with the two P bingo.
>Dave: ?BCILLU 14A CLUBLIk. +76 440
#note I had no idea whether this was good or not, despite having looked over the entire -LIKE list multiple times.  But I thought I needed to try it, because he was sure to block the lane on the next turn, and the chances of creating a bingo elsewhere were not good.  I suppose LI N2 might be the best non-phony practical chance.  John held the play for a long time, until he was down to just a little bit of time on his clock.
>O'laugh: ADEFGIN A12 FI.E +39 426
#note I can't blame him for not challenging for a couple of reasons: 1) CLUBLIKE seems so plausible. 2) The endgame is really close, and it's quite conceivable that I could make a losing mistake or that he could pick up enough points in a recount.

#note Hey Johnny O, your program has a bug.  Championship player prefers FOBS, which loses to a V stick.
>O'laugh: ADGN 7L DANG +16 442
#note "Dang!" said Johnny O, "454 is not enough for the win, but it is enough for the high loss of round 1."
