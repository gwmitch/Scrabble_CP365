#note Sim favors HUNKIE for perhaps obvious reasons, but I'd never play it. Exchanging is backwards here.

#note Whew, something interesting! In a tournament game I think I look hard enough to find the visibly superior WAVEFORM, although it's very far from guaranteed that I find it. And after all that, it's probably not even right. Plays that maintain pressure without digging too deep in the bag should be given precedence here, leading one to either O1 WAME +34 or B8 WIFE +38.
