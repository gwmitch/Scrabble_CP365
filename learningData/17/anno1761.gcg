>Eric_Kinderman: AIMNRTV 8D VARMINT +82 82
#note If you insist.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?HINTTY G8 .YTH +16 16
#note Missing THI(R)TY F5 and YI(R)TH F6.
>Eric_Kinderman: AELNO H11 ALONE +23 105
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BIMNNT 13E INT.MB +14 30
#note Guess this is my punishment for the miss.
>Eric_Kinderman: DEER J6 DE.ER +12 117
#note Okay, if these are the tiles you're playing, what are KEEPING?!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CNNORT 15A NOCTuRN. +80 110
#note And the peasants... rejoice.  I have no idea how I found that word.  I probably picked it up watching people play online as I have a really shaky base of word study passed like, oh, 1000 8s and 3000 7s.  This one is about 7000 deep in the 8s, which means at this rate I'll get to it about 3 years from now.  :)
>Eric_Kinderman: AQ 10E QA. +14 131
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIILSS 11D SI +26 136
#note Best, oddly enough.
>Eric_Kinderman: ALW I5 LAW. +23 154
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGILS H1 GLIDE +29 165
#note Shoulda played this with the S at K3 for 40, though I hate breaking up this rack.
>Eric_Kinderman: CEELOOR 4A RECOOLE. +74 228
#note And it goes downhill from here.  I held for a while, couldn't get a read on him, but shoulda just went with my gut and challenged, especially with my shitty, shitty rack.  Of course you can't REcool something!  Once it's cooled, it's cooled!  But those silly RE and UN words are just that.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAIPRS 14J AA +10 175
#note Oh, BTW, in this shitty, shitty rack I missed PARASAI(L) 2A!
>Eric_Kinderman: EOTV A1 OVE.T +24 252
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIOPRS 2F PE.ORIAS +68 243
#note I couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger on POLARISE though who knows how many times I've seen it.  There are also three cool extensions: (OVERT)OPS, (OVERT)IRE, and (OVERT)IPS, in order from best to worst with no sim.
>Eric_Kinderman: EOWY 1L YOWE +53 305
#note ...and that was a big mistake
>Ryan_Fischer: AADGIIN 12A GADI +20 263
#note After about 350 spins, it's this second to AIDING.  I did see the possibility of something along row 15 but sure didn't look hard enough.  GADI takes out bingos ending in N or O.  Both long shots, but not totally inconceivable.  AIDING opens the possibility of -ING bingos but kills the last S hook.  I passed up 17 points, ultimately, to preserve an S hook I don't have.  Probably not incredibly smart, though another argument, even though the blank is in the bag, is GADI maintains some semblance of a leave.
>Eric_Kinderman: EFZ K9 FEZ +37 342
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIINSU F2 .U.I +6 269
#note Missed INdUSIA, which I know, but is sure as hell hard to find, especially on this board.  In light of the miss, I'm not sure if setting up the K hook is brilliant or stupid.  Probably a little bit of both.
>Eric_Kinderman: BDETU 15K DEBUT +30 372
#note Another argument for why AIDING was the play a few racks back.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIJNOS M13 JO. +24 293
#note Now it's just getting comical.  Oh, and I missed bANJOIS(T) O8.  Go figure.  I saw ADJOINTS immediately and couldn't bring myself to look for anything else.
>Eric_Kinderman: X 14M .X +36 408
#note STOP DRAWING POWER TILES!!!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGINPS 10J ..P +5 298
#note I had all but thrown in the tile -- er, towel -- here, and didn't even bother looking down from the E.  (E)LAPSING FT... well... closer game.
>Eric_Kinderman: EFKRU C2 FU.KER +32 440
#note How apt.  :]  Didn't even acknowledge the pretty hook I left for you.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGINSS M4 ASkINGS +66 364
#note missing any number of betting bingos on column O, like (E)SSAyING, (E)AStINGS, etc.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (HIU) +12 376
#note Another low point.  It's quite possible I'm sleepwalking.  I WAS awake until 2 AM the previous night, having picked up a friend from the airport, and I did come in late.  But those are reasons, not excuses.  Inconsistency such as this is the worst thing about my game.  It gets better though.
