>Brendan_Sullivan: EGMRRSU 8G GRUM +14 14
#note Whoops, didn't remember GRUME. I'd probably take 6 extra points for that, although all the placements of GRUM are simming better than GRUME.
>fairway: ?ANNRUV J6 VU. +16 16
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACEGRSW G6 WA.GER +14 28
#note Exch GW sims really well. H4 WAGE(R) 13 sims better than WAGGER, too, but I wanted to set up the S.
>fairway: ?AINNNR 7I N.N +7 23
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACCEPSW F10 PAC +25 53
#note I really didn't like keeping double Cs, which swayed me away from WAP or PEW.
>fairway: ?AAINRT 13B ARTIsAN +71 94
#note 11D AN(AR)ThRIA 82! It means loss of the motor ability that produces speech. 13C mARTIAN/TAmARIN are one point better and don't open a B hook. He missed BARTISAN later, so maybe he just blanked on it altogether.
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEIOSTW L2 COWIEST +80 133
#note A lucky draw to CESW, but I totally lapsed on the SWAGGER hook I had set up before!
>fairway: ?GHIILV 5K V.GIL +18 112
>Brendan_Sullivan: DENOOST H12 O.TO +15 148
#note M3 DOG 21 is much better, and O1 NOODLE 27 is probably best with a medium lead like this.
>fairway: ?AAFHIT E8 HAAF +37 149
#note 2J FA(C)IA 36 is also pretty good.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEENOSU O5 .UDE +15 163
#note With a roughly even score, I wanted to make sure I would bingo really soon, and the ENOS leave seemed ideal for that purpose. The sim is saying I should take the points though, with NODULE or LOUDEN.
>fairway: ?AILNRT 15H .RIeNTAL +74 223
#note D4 ReLIANT 78.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EMNOSSZ B10 ZOE.S +68 231
#note ZONAE also works, but SS isn't too helpful on this board.
>fairway: DEEFRUY 14K REEF +29 252
#note 2J DE(C)URY 32.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIILMNS N3 AN.MI +26 257
#note K3 MA(V)IN 25 sims a little better, maybe because of the prevalence of vowels in the virtual bag.
>fairway: DORTUXY 13J TODY +34 286
#note O1 OXY 44.
>Brendan_Sullivan: IILOQST I11 QI +13 270
#note There's really no good reason to save the S with no hook potential here. O1 QIS 38 is worth it.
>fairway: EEIRUXY O1 REX +39 325
#note 11I QUEY or QUERY are probably better, since EIUY could turn quite ugly down the stretch.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DDILOST H8 .OD +14 284
#note A terrible move. I have to hope for a really lucky draw to catch a bingo on Column D. F2 DILDO 20 helps my cause a lot more, opening things up.
>fairway: BEIOPUY D7 YUP +19 344
#note Here is when the BARTISAN hook comes in handy: A12 OBEY 44.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DIILOST 2I ODI. +11 295
#note It's too easy for him to make a play here, and if he has the J, I could be S.O.L. C7 OD 17 is best, opening the SOY hook. Yes, I'm keeping the II combo, but there's only one more unseen.
>fairway: ABEIKNO 1G KAB +31 375
#note It's too easy for me to bingo after this play. H1 EIKON 38 might only lose if I get BHEESTIE, SHELTIES, STEELIES, or LIBELEES thru the E, or THEELOLS thru the O. Even still, the 38 points are enough that he can still win even if I bingo. I think BHEESTIE is the only killer response.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EILLSST 5A LISTELS +76 371
#note I took the 2 extra points with the 5A placement over the 3C one, but the other one apparently wins 37% of games, whereas my choice only wins 29%. Hmmm. Maybe I need to hope to draw the J and catch a big play, like D1 JOIN? Can't he block easily anyway?
>fairway: EEEIJNO D1 JOIN. +40 415
#note C2 JEE(S) 22 is best. It doesn't give me any easy parallel plays; it forces me to go out with HEB(E) for 9 and lose by 9.
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEH C3 HE. +24 395
#note Best.
>fairway: EEE J2 .EE +4 419
#note Sure this gives me BOB/BE for 17, but I already had GOB/NUB for 17 available.
>Brendan_Sullivan: B I1 ..B +17 412
#note A tough loss. My fishing plays in the second half were weak and didn't give me good chances for the win.
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (E) +2 414
