#note to my eyes, this was the turning point of the game, because I would spent a few turns saddled with the Is while he chugged away. I suppose I didn't really think that IIY was much better. But hanging the Y in the triple lane with no prospects whatsoever of being able to use it is terrible news. In fact, FAY at 7G does a bit better, which shouldn't be at all surprising - At least the L offers me an I dump if I need it. However, best is FAIL at F10, which makes sense too because it leaves the least terrible leave of the three and keeps the board closed. I'm not sure what I was thinking at the time, but opening the board with a terrible leave is a recipe for losing.

#note dear god, I just suck. all I can think is that I was so settled on my play I just didn't even look at that T. blaaaah

>Jesse_Day: GHIIITT J8 .IGIT +11 175
#note I think my racks are actually off at this point, because I specifically remember thinking that I was a tile off from DITZ (missing the D) and that's why I put up with DIGIT. Then again, given the way I've been playing I shouldn't expect too much. If this is my rack, then TITI at I11 is evidently best, which is kinda interesting...I was just hoping to draw an R or a D to play up top, but TITI does the same thing only moreso if I draw an A. I'm still not entirely sure how GHI can be competitive, though.

#note this is another rack that I'm not 100% sure about. this looks like it might be right, in which case I missed KOHLS at A13...that's not the sort of play I think I would miss, but then again I do lots of stupid things all the time.

#note if french words were allowed, KOS at 12L would be a total no brainer. Failing that, quackle laughs at my play. My winning chances are pretty low nonetheless, but I simply thought that I had to do something to keep the game remotely competitive. quackle likes KOS at 3D, which seems lame, or OAKS and KOAS on row 13, which also seem to do very little. quackle should have a panic button.
>Darrell_Day: DEEN 4F ...ENED +40 447
#note more cuteness from darrell's end.
>Jesse_Day: ENNRSST 13F TR.NS +22 316
#note a surprisingly bad move, at least to my eyes. The right play is NANS at the same spot, which bingos 62% of the time versus 25% of the time!! I supposed I seriously underestimated how much better ERST was, especially given that that's the last R out there. My winning percentages are at .15% by now anyway, so it's not too important.
>Darrell_Day: AIOT 3C IOTA +18 465
#note block me, darrell!
>Jesse_Day: EEGINSV 4A VINE +28 344
#note well, if he continues not to block maybe I have a chance...
>Darrell_Day: ELMOU A4 .OLUME +33 498
>Jesse_Day: AAEGNOS 3J ANOA +15 359
#note I was pretty low on time, and the endgame isn't going to be doing much anyway, but ANOA is pretty clearly a crappy play. quackle wants me to fish off an A, but fails to realize that darrell can block both of my spots for DIAGNOSE if I draw the I without too much trouble. I guess I should really worry about blocking his potential bingos of ISOLEAD or SHOALED, which ANOA fails to do...maybe DOSAGE? However, ISOLEAD plays over on the left anyways, so it only blocks SHOALED, but DOSAGE is still the best play I can come up with. Any other suggestions?

#note good thing I found the one over here.
>Jesse_Day:  (HILOS) +16 385
#note I suppose I didn't play terribly, but at the same time my game was pretty much entirely unexceptional - I never made anything but the obvious move, which often turned out to be wrong. FLAY was a pretty terrible decision, but wasn't really responsible for the game getting out of hand as it did. I think that in retrospect I might have been tired from playing my fourth in a row. It was about time for lunch break.
