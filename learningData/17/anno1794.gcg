#note Prior to this move, all of my choices were kibitzer's favorites, but TONY is way down on the depth chart.  It's not that TONY is so bad per se, but that there are several other much stronger moves.  The top simming play is just dropping the Y at 8F for 20 points.  This rack is more bingoable than I appreciated, with both the S hook on column L and -ING possibilities on column I.  I didn't see that Y drop possibility, but I definitely considered and passed by JERKY/YO which also sims much better than my play. YO is about 5 behind YEGGS, and my play is 11 back.  IONICITY is a cute way to score 34 points, but it doesn't sim as well because of poor defense.  E7 YONIC also probably breaks the rack up too quickly, but it is definitely superior to my move in terms of both score and leave.

#note I guess it's instant karma that immediately after my blunder he blocked AUTOPSIC for a double-double.
>Dave: ACIOPSU 15L .AUP +27 128
#note Equity-wise this is actually a small error, but I consider it a major mental error that I didn't even think of COUPS 8A in this position.  Despite scoring 19 less, my move sims second best, only 1.5 behind.  I know the leave is much better and without an S he might not be able to do much on this board.  But I'm honestly shocked that my play which scores so much less can be nearly as good.
>Jim: IL F3 LI... +12 137
#note A cute way to manage his rack, especially now that both B's are gone.

#note Hm... as in the game with Robin, I may have overvalued the IR leave.  However, given that there are so few I's remaining, I don't hate keeping the R here.  I'm much more likely to pick up an A or an E, which would go quite nicely with IR.  With both blanks still out, one could definitely make the case for playing off the extra tile.  Sim favors OUTLIER by about 1 point.

#note It would appear that I've been more lucky than good in this game.  But don't worry, the luck is about to turn.

#note Great play by Jim.  He recognized that bingos were very unlikely on this board, reducing the value of the blank.  This play scores well enough to get him back in contention.
>Dave: ACDLRTW 13L .W.D +16 309
#note I didn't have a whole lot of choice here, but I was happy to take out this zone, which was one of the better scoring spots available on the board.  I figured that even a 24 point edge was pretty substantial on this board, especially if he was unable to make a play to H1.
>Jim: AAGMNSY 12B GYMNAS.A +78 363
#note I was wrong.
>Dave: ACILRRT G2 RAT +13 322
#note I really liked this play to give myself a chance to get back in it, if I could only draw that D.
>Jim: ?ELOOZ 1G fOOZLE +48 411
#note Ouch!  Another great play by Big Jim.  It's hard to believe that three moves ago, he was the one in serious trouble.  What follows is (I think) perfect play in the endgame for both sides.  Try to work it out for yourself.

#note Cleverly blocking all of my outs.

#note A great game by Jim.  I can't complain about losing one like this.  Just have to tip my cap to him.
