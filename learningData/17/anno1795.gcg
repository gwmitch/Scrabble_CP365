>David_Abolafia: ENTUW 8H UNWET +18 18
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHNPSV K7 H.AVEN +24 24
#note 1000 spins 4-ply and it's VA(W) J6 FTW.  Don't get it, but I guess it's the PH combo.  HAV(E)N and HAV(E) at K5 also finish ahead of my play.  They lack defense, and set up an S-hook that might be blocked in one place, so I don't know what to make of the results.
>David_Abolafia: INOV 9F VINO +14 32
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEIPSU L11 DUP +19 43
#note DUP is best after about 500 spins 4-ply.  I really wanted to play PUDDIES* or UPSIDED*.  :)
>David_Abolafia: ASZ 14J ZAS +39 71
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEGIST 7B aGISTED +65 108
#note (UNWET)TED is the winner by far.  Duh.  I was just so giddy that UNWET doesn't take an S and I was waiting for him to drop one that I didn't even think to extend it.  I'm happy to report, aGISTED is the winner of the losers.  :)  
>David_Abolafia: EKNO E3 KENO. +18 89
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EILRRT 15E RETRIaL +80 188
#note Best.  Of some note is a simple 9, TRaILER(ED).  I think I looked there for a while with ?DEGIST, but there were none.
>David_Abolafia: EX 8A EX +35 124
#note A move of questionable defensive value, but he needed it.
>Ryan_Fischer: CFGLORW 14C CROW +32 220
#note FOL(I)C D4 40 triple sidelap* is best, very hard to see.  I wanted to sort of snap off the potency of the (P)RETRIAL hook, though hard to say if he'd see it.  What I didn't realize is PRETRIAL *does* take an S.  Anyway, it's between GROW and CROW for second best, and GROW comes out better after about 800 spins 4-ply.  After about 700 spins, GLOW snuck into 3rd place, which is crazy because of the foreboding A hook it leaves.  I know, leave it run longer.  I'll leave it to someone with a more powerful computer to explain that phenomenon.  FOLIC leaves two hotspots open, which is fine but a little risky.  I like CROW so much because it's defensive and keeps the F to play FA/FAX or the like for an easy 36 points if any other better plays fail (why I passed on OW this turn; 14B is so much more dangerous.  CFL, CFR, or FGL as a leave might be the real question, too.
>David_Abolafia: BI M12 BI +21 145
>Ryan_Fischer: AFGHILO 6A OF +33 253
#note Overlaps of ALOF(T) F3 and HAF(T) F4 are so hard to see.  I went ahead and took OF 6B, keeping the okay AGHIL.  I did see the possibility of GOLIA(T)H, but didn't look hard enough for a T.  Even though this move doesn't sim best, it moves 6 tiles and keeps things moving.  I keep the F which will still be good for 33-36 points with OF or FA near the X.  Probably why after 700 spins 4-ply it sims second best to ALOF(T).  I would play GOLIA(T)H in a heartbeat because of the value of the F.  In this sim, IF > OF > FA, but who knows how that will change down the line.
>David_Abolafia: ADENORS 4D R.ASONED +70 215
#note ALOF(T) and HAF(T) now had hidden value of closing down the bingo line.  Two turns I missed that added defensive power.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGHIILP D12 HA.P +36 289
#note I think I might have played HA(R)P a little too quickly since I was waiting for it.  GIIL isn't great, but there is no equivalent play.  This sets up an unfortunate S hook.  The next best play is PHI N13 23, setting up an S hook and killing my P, so despite the risk, HARP is probably best.
>David_Abolafia: AIJ H1 JIA. +33 248
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIILLR F9 .IRL +9 298
#note I have no idea what I was trying to do here.  Maybe kill that S hook and balance?  Best is RIG(OR) E11, or ILIA or GLIA F1.  The rack is tough, which makes it easy to be blinded by the low scores.
>David_Abolafia: CMY 9A MYC +33 281
#note He saw the blank as an O, so I catch a break.  I make MUCH worse gaffes than this later in the tourney, though.
>David_Abolafia: CMY --  -33 248
>Ryan_Fischer: AAGILLU 2F GL.AL +12 310
#note Unfortunately my draw doesn't give me too much of a chance to capitalize, so I just try to shut it down a bit more.  (J)UGAL woulda been just fine.  GL(I)AL does a bit of the same.  Other options are U(R)IAL 11E 10 and A(H) 7J 10.  I REALLY like A(H) now that I look at it.  Why?  I draw one of the remaining 5 Es and I get A(I)GUILLE 2G 72!  Love that word, woulda definitely saw it if I sat down for a few more seconds and maybe alphabetized my rack.  Live and learn.  :)
>David_Abolafia: CGMY N13 GYM +24 272
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFIU 11E F.AUD +18 328
#note My rack's only partially right here, but I'm just trying to score a bit, hope he doesn't have the S.  Which he probably does.  AI O14 is great defense.
>David_Abolafia: EENT 5J TEEN +16 288
#note Yeah, he has the S, or the Y (though he probably woulda played it here or at 015 if he did).
>Ryan_Fischer: AAIIQRU 1D QUA +25 353
#note I was VERY low on time now, but I did remember I wanted to save the second A as some short of insurance as it's the last one.  That's why QUA instead of AQUA.  AI O14 keeping AIQUR is still awesome and would probably save me a lot of grief.
>David_Abolafia: OY O14 OY +41 329
#note OW! er... OY!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIOR M2 IRO.E +10 363
#note Incomplete rack again due to time.  I'm just desperate to block if possible.
>David_Abolafia: BCE 2L B.CE +16 345
>Ryan_Fischer: AIMOT C1 AMI +23 386
#note Just go with what I set up earlier, though it's valued poorly.
>David_Abolafia: EIST 2A SE.I +23 368
>Ryan_Fischer: OT A4 TO. +4 390
#note By the hammer of Thor!  I pull it out by the skin of my teeth!  Wow, I gotta play faster!  That should not have been so close.  Shoulda fished for AIGUILLE, closed it a turn later, though who knows, he mighta had the goods then.  Shoulda blocked the TLS hotspot with AI.  Didn't think I could, and the Q was a bit deceiving as to how dangerous it actually was in that position.
