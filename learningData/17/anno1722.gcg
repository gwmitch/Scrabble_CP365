#note Maybe these eights are starting to take hold. Sure, it’s only number 81 on your list, but it’s 1921 on mine, so it’s a big deal to me!

>Kelly: CEIOORT 12K OTIC +17 127
#note COO(L)-10B or (G)OO-10J are probably better for the powerful leaves. Still have a hard time going to the fish tank without an S. Incidentally, the Fishtank was a local college bar down the street from me when I lived in Lexington. A buddy of mine won the pub quiz one time in part due to being the only person who knew the term for using all your tiles while playing Scrabble.

#note I’m glad CP approved of keeping the Q, when any U might lead to a high score at 4H and any I could hook YON.

#note Damn it, damn it, son of a bitch!
>Kelly: AAILLRS 14J AIL +15 201
#note It’s a horserace between a bunch of plays here and a few over by the H. I hated this play when I made it, but CP thinks it’s as good as anything. Had I known the word, I would have played LA(H)AR to open up multiple bingo fronts.

>Kelly: ?EEJKOS 6N JO +54 310
#note CP likes J(O)KE-4A or JOE-A1 best, keeping alive chances for nines. Now that I’m learning some eights, I’ll be able to find a nine now and then, I suppose.

>Kelly: ?BEEKSU 15L lEKU +24 334
#note Idiocy. I wanted an out in two at either C3 or K4, but thought I needed to keep an E for UT. Takes an S too, I hear. SKEE-15L is best.
