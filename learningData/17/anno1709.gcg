#note This looks like a real word but it's not.  I'm not surprised it stayed.  I was blissfully unaware of the huge Q/X spot I created.

>Brad_W.: BDKOQRY D1 BODY +39 108
#note Now that I have the Q, of course I notice the spot.  I decided to score 39 elsewhere and see if I could draw one of those I's.

#note Missed F7 RAI(N)COAT 62.  I always miss this one on Aerolith.  Pesky compound words.  I6 IOTA 21 also better.

#note Quackle likes several other low scoring plays better.  I like my play because it takes out the easiest bingo lane.

#note E9 N(i)NTH 29 is the star play.  My play is the next best play that doesn't involve exchanging.

#note I saw both of his bingos, AmBONES and SeABO(R)NE.  I didn't like his chances of finding either one.  I wanted to block the row 14 spot because that seemed more likely, but I couldn't find a way to do it that scored, didn't keep the X, and didn't give him a big comeback play.  So I took out the other lane.
