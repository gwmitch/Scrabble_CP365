>Steve_Grob: AEHINUY 8D HYENA +30 30
#note Hate the leave, but this appears to be correct.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?BELORR H8 .RBOREaL +80 80
#note Nice.
>Steve_Grob: AILPUVZ 14C PLUVI. +18 48
#note Knew I was taking a chance when I put this down.
>Jerry_Lerman: ITU 15A TUI +13 93
#note Jerry likes the IU combo about as much as the folks in West Lafayette - he lets PLUVIA* go after a lengthy hold. 
>Steve_Grob: AAAJNOZ 10F JA. +28 76
#note This and ZOA 9c in a dead heat.
>Jerry_Lerman: EINOSTU 12A SNOUTIE. +68 161
>Steve_Grob: AAINOOZ A8 ZOON. +42 118
#note Duck sacrifices nine points to keep the N and plays ZO(N)A at B10 - and says it isn't close: valuation 33.1 to 28.1.
>Jerry_Lerman: GHO B10 HO.G +31 192
>Steve_Grob: AAEIRSV B6 VIA +25 143
>Jerry_Lerman: EEGNRSU E1 GUERNSE. +74 266
#note Great find.
>Steve_Grob: AADEMRS 1A DAMA.ERS +167 310
#note Jerry's great play gets punished. Fortune shines on lucky 'ole me.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEX 2C EA.X +58 324
#note Well, that lead was short-lived. Jerry ain't gonna roll over just because he caught a bad break.
>Steve_Grob: ?ADIINW 3A DAW +30 340
>Jerry_Lerman: KOT C9 KOT. +22 346
>Steve_Grob: ?EIINPT 11G P.INTIEr +73 413
#note If I knew PRISTINE didn't take any end hooks, I may have played that at 4D.
>Jerry_Lerman: EGLO 4A OGLE. +30 376
#note Scores and keeps the board open. Beautiful.
>Steve_Grob: CDFIMOR M9 FR.MD +30 443
#note I elect to conserve on the vowels and cut out the bingo line with the E and the R. I also considered FORM(I)C. Something I didn't see, but which didn't get by the duck is M(E)DIC. It only scores 20, but sets the case O up nicely.
>Jerry_Lerman: ABEEFIL K5 FLEABI.E +76 452
#note Wow.
>Steve_Grob: ACCIORY L1 CORIA +25 468
#note Glad I had plenty of time left, and I took most of it to make this play. It loses if the Q is in the bag, but it was something I could live with. The other choices I saw were CYC(L)O and C(L)ARY. CIRCA at L1 is best, and I saw that too; just didn't know for sure that it was good.
>Jerry_Lerman: DIQSTTW 2J TW. +8 460
#note Takes away my only out play.
>Steve_Grob: CENY 8J C.Y +12 480
#note Not the brightest move. Didn't see his other spot for the Q.
>Jerry_Lerman: DIQST 3I QI +23 483
>Steve_Grob: EN M3 EN +10 490
#note One of my favorite games of the tournament. I could not have dreamed of a better start.
>Steve_Grob:  (DST) +8 498
