>Steve_Grob: FILLPUY 8D FULLY +30 30
#note In making this play, I was hoping to take advantage of the one or two extensions to the tws that I knew, later in the game. I wasn't aware that there are actually an even dozen!
>Darryl_Day: AKW F6 WA.K +19 19
>Steve_Grob: ?CEIMNP G8 .IMP +16 46
#note Another missed bingo, but not something I expect myself to find.
>Darryl_Day: AEITX H11 AXITE +64 83
>Steve_Grob: ?CEENSU 13G S.NECUrE +72 118
#note Big equity hit from not finding the best bingo. This is also inferior to the extension play from 8A that saves the blank.
>Darryl_Day: DHLO N10 HOL.D +34 117
>Steve_Grob: AAEEINN 12G A.E +22 140
>Darryl_Day: DENOSST J7 STENOS.D +76 193
#note Nice.
>Steve_Grob: ACEINNR O5 CANNIER +84 224
#note Saw the bingo that played at 15A for five more points, but wasn't entirely sure of its validity. I took the sure thing.
>Darryl_Day: ERU 8A RUE..... +42 235
#note One of the many extensions I didn't take into account on my opening play.

>Darryl_Day: MU N6 MU +22 257
>Steve_Grob: AEIILOO D8 .OLIO +16 282
#note FLOOIE rates about four points better in the valuation.

>Steve_Grob: DEHOPRT K9 HOP +33 404
#note Didn't see this missed bingo, and even if I did probably would have chickened out on it. The extra points could have put the game away right here and now.
>Darryl_Day: ?ABGINT 15A TANGIBl. +86 412
#note Nice, although he could have played a variant of the same word from H1 for an extra nine points.
>Steve_Grob: BDEORTZ C7 Z.D +30 434
>Darryl_Day: ADEEOOR C5 OO... +15 427
>Steve_Grob: ABEIOTT 4C BIOTA +32 466
#note Tough choice on whether to empty the bag. I decide on the do-or-die play. He's not going to get another chance to fish. C-player also empties the bag, but with BIO. This makes sense, since any bingo will have to start with the D. 25k sim says BIO is 76 percent to win, my play just 51 percent.
