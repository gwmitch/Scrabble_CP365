>Bing: AEFFIIO 9G IFF +31 31
#note I should just played IF - the hook will almost always remain next turn for a better score.
>Carl: ?AAOORT F9 TAO +15 37
>Bing: AEIOOPT E10 ATOP +18 49
#note No appealing options; this was as good as anything.
>Carl: ?AACORZ 10I AZO +37 74
#note Carl comments: An interesting play here is CORyZA 14B. I don't think I would have spotted it, not least because I was too preoccupied with whether PARAZOiC* 13E would be acceptable.
>Bing: EEGHIOS D12 HOG +28 77
#note HOE seemed a little too crazy; it might be better though.
>Carl: ?ACENRR L7 CRANkER +81 155
#note C: I passed up a few points with stuff along row H, but didn't see CAREw(O)RN.
>Bing: EEIOSSV 15A VOES +33 110
>Carl: ADEIRTV C8 DIVERT +38 193
#note C: Dithering over this vs. the more defensive VERT. Although DIVERT wins the sim, it proved costly.
>Bing: EEILSST D3 LISTEES +72 182
#note Glad to have the spot! Of course CRANKER doesn't take the S.

>Bing: BLMNNTU 13I BLU.T +20 226
#note Possibly a key error - I debated between this and BLUNT 3C, which would have worked out much better.

#note Still keeping pace.
>Carl: EGIKOWX N6 KI.G +19 346
#note C: Hoping to take out hotspots before playing OX. Also, I was hoping you might play off the J, which would make OX safer.
>Bing: ABEIIIS 3L BI +22 340
#note It looked like I might still have a chance at this point. I didn't know Carl was just toying with me.
>Carl: ?DEORWX 2E OX +52 398
#note C: Championship player here likes DETOX 6B. While BI does not telegraph the J, it does suggest a good leave, which DETOX strongly devalues. It's quite a sacrifice, and I just didn't have the discipline to even consider it.
>Bing: AEEIIMS 14I AI +12 352
>Carl: ?DEJNRW 1A JoWED +52 450
#note C: Lots to consider here. Championship player says that JOE E1 wins 13% more often, presumably because I'll always bingo out if I draw a vowel. On the other hand, your play makes it less likely that many vowels remain to be drawn. In retrospect, DETOX would have been a marvelous play.
