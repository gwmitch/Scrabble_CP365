#note This puts me down just 12 points, and I see no need to start fishing so early.
>Tijan_Jeng: BCOR D4 CORB. +24 94
>Winter: ADEEIIU H7 A.IEU +8 66
#note Want to open the board. Never played Tijan, don't know his style, but if he likes to play closed, this board will make it easy for him, so I open preemptively.
>Tijan_Jeng: AOR G3 ORA +12 106
#note See, he's giving up points to play tight, as I expected.
>Winter: DEFITUU F1 FUD +14 80
#note One tile away from OUT.
>Tijan_Jeng: KW 5C W.K +20 126
>Winter: EIIMTUW 6B ME.IT +26 106
#note Now I suspect bad racks will come no matter what I leave, so I'm loathe to give up scoring. If I keep it close, Tijan might start to fizzle out.

#note Draw all the fucking powee tiles, why don't you???
>Winter: BEEFMTU 7B EB. +25 221
