#note Wishing Rafi had opted for RATINES.
>Rafi: CINORRS 14B COR +14 166
#note Preferable to cashing in COIRS/FUCKS - INRS has great chances if he draws one of the 10 E's left.

#note Rafi says: I made sure to study the top 50 7s before the tournament. Looks like my hard work paid off!

>Rafi: EIIOPRW B10 POI +23 259
#note R: POW, WIZ, and POI all sim pretty close together. I dismissed POW because EIIR could get ugly with 5 E's and 2 I's left. What I was really looking for was a play that reached for a blank... like RIPIE(N)O, which I missed.
>Bing: DDMNUV? D2 VUM +24 277
#note Seeing the last O fall made this choice a lot easier.
>Rafi: EEEEIRW 3I WEE.IER +28 287
#note R: My first thought was to block the VUM hook with REVIEW or WEEVER, but EE and EI look pretty bad with some E's and I's still remaining. Obviously Dave is holding a blank, and I badly need to draw the other one. WEENIE and WEENIER are great for trying to get the blank, but I didn't think of WEENIE during the game.
>Bing: DDILNY? N2 N.DDY +36 313
>Rafi: ABBEIPR O6 ABBE +29 316
#note Fine play: scores well, gives much-needed chances at drawing the blank, and keeps a reasonable leave for sevens with a spot to play on column N.
>Bing: ??EEILT 15H .EaLTIEs +71 384
#note Ah, my old friends the blanks! Clear to block the easy bingo lanes.

#note Finally I manage to win a close one.
