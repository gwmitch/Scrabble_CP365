#note FUNGO.  Whoops.

>Ryan_Fischer: EGHINRT 2H RIGHTEN +82 136
#note Aw, she blocked RET(C)HING for 176!  At least I got away with this.
>Jan_Dixon: UX 7G XU +38 151
>Ryan_Fischer: ?FIORSU 10D U.SIFORm +64 200
#note She blocked OU(T)FIReS.  :/  I luckily found the best play, but there's a case to be made for just playing FOU considering this only scores 64.  Of note, U(N)IFORmS 62.  Both bings make the blank a M, which is kinda cool.
>Jan_Dixon: AILMNNO 1L AMIN +30 181
#note AMI(CABLE)(!)  Also, later she told me she had NOMINAL but couldn't see the place for it.  Actually, there are two!  Of note, shitty MON(GO)LIANS at Shitty Wok, always tearing down our walls!  4A for 66.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEPQTV 3G QAT +29 229
#note Feh.  QAT is 2nd to PAVE even though it loses the Q.  The leave is pretty bad.  Of note: E(XU)V(I)ATE for 23.
>Jan_Dixon: ELNY 2B NE.LY +49 230
#note Not that I could know, but PAVE blocks that.  Nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEPTTVV 6H VET +16 245
#note Here's where I lose the game, trying to play through a rack where EXCHANGE is almost clear.  I do play the second best play, yes, but leaving PVT is going nowhere fast.  VE(R)VET, which I did see, is the play if anything is.
>Jan_Dixon: AOZ K5 ZOA +31 261
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEILPTV 3A VEL. +20 265
#note Best.  Balance finally achieved.  But...
>Jan_Dixon: AEIORST A3 .IATORES +86 347
#note Ow.  :(
>Ryan_Fischer: EHINOPT B8 ETH +31 296
#note I'm still in it at this point, but barely.  I need to make something happen, though, instead of shutting it down.  Whatever I do, B(URSIFORM) is now outta play.  Oh well, next life.  HOP is the play.  Leave the E hook, hard to hit the triple, still some plausible ways to bingo.  I played ETH because of the abundance of Es, and I thought THO gave back too much.  Wrong.  And ETHION, as I thought, was suicidal.
>Jan_Dixon: EY 9I YE +20 367
#note Killing the J spot, she said.
>Ryan_Fischer: DGIJNOP 1A JO +30 326
#note And rightfully so.
>Jan_Dixon: BDEIIKS 5I BI. +20 387
#note Because SHBURSIFORM* is no good.  :(
>Ryan_Fischer: DDGINOP 11J GOD +16 342
#note M1 (ME)NDIGO 24.  Really?  Oh well.  I'm lost here as to what I can really do to give myself a chance.  Champ chooses MENDIGO or GIPON.
>Jan_Dixon: DDEIIKS M5 KIDDIES +72 459
#note But of course!
>Ryan_Fischer: CDINOPW 12I POW +18 360
#note Open another lane and pray, not that I can catch her.
>Jan_Dixon: NN G10 .NN +3 462
#note Blocking DECIARE, she said, the bingo she saw that played.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEINR 13K NARIC +20 380
#note I just don't cairn anymore. :D  NICAD is better than NARIC.  CADE N4 27 is better than them all!  Champ says play ED 3L first, then you have an unblockable NARIC to go out.  Just the wrong order, giving up too much, is all.
