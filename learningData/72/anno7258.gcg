#note initially put down MISERLY at 07 before realising my mistake. I missed the bingo through the D.  After failing to find that, i got a bit fishy-fishy. Q prefers point taking with 14a MIS(E)RY or 15a EMY(D).   but that's meaningless if i actually find the bingo.  what's annoying is that i'm 8 in a row in study with that word and i wont see it again for 105 days apparently.
