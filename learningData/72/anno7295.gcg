>Winter: BEEEQTY K7 Q.T +12 12
#note I'd usually try to play thru the Q, but I don't see good chances of scoring with it if I don't draw the U. I do see chances of a bingo (EYEBEAM) or at least a good score even with BEEEY.

#note Ugh--costly mistake.
>Sue_Gable: ?EINNTY 5H INTEN.lY +70 230
>Winter: AAABGLU O1 BULG. +39 145
#note Ugh--scored this for 30, not 39. Not that it would make a difference.
>Sue_Gable: BO 4H BO +16 246
>Winter: AAALNOO 15N NA +24 169
#note I knew Quack would like ANOA, but the probleem is that leaves just the DO as the only bingo line (or a play to the A at M2), and I already know Sue's style--she'll block it right away.
>Sue_Gable: CCIR 2I CIRC. +11 257
#note See what I mean--she has good tils, IRC, but she choose to block for 11 points rather than going for another bingo.
>Winter: AAILOOV 7C VIOLA +18 187
>Sue_Gable: GIR E4 GIR. +10 267
#note Again, she's just going to keep blocking with dinky plays, which means I can actually catch up if my tiles don't turn to shit.
>Winter: AEHIOPW 3G POH +33 220
#note ,AWEI(G)H and WHOA will just give Sue an easy counterplay. I need to limit her scoring chances. If I can just draw well to the AEIW leave, I might have a chance given the power tiles still in the bag.
>Sue_Gable: IKRS 10D IRKS +23 290
#note See.
>Winter: AEEIOUW 4K WE. +21 241
#note Anything that doesn't score is useless on this board. She will block any line. The only way I win is with J, X, and if she can't score.
>Sue_Gable: AJM D3 JAM +34 324
#note Now I'm pretty much fucked.
>Winter: AEILORU 3B RA. +20 261
>Sue_Gable: DEN C7 .END +19 343
#note See, going for the bingo is useless b/c she will block.
>Winter: EEILOUU B1 EU.O +8 269
#note My one last chance to win, if she blocks the 3x3 for a few points and I hit the other bingo for a lot. OU(R)IE would have been better tho.
>Sue_Gable: AX A1 AX +42 385
#note And the final insult to the dignity of Scrabble.
