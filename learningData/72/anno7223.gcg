>Jim_Burlant: ALMQSUX 8D QUALM +52 52
#note Now that's a nice start - 52 points and it takes all of 1/2 second to see the play.  But I was only just beginning...
>Orry_Swift: BIO 9B OBI +19 19
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABSTUX 10A AX +50 102
#note The only bingo I saw in this rack was the 8, BAUXITES, which didn't play.  Didn't know SAXTUBA or its anagram SUBTAXA.  This choice, despite giving up 40+ scoreboard points to the bingos, only concedes 8 equity to 10D SaXTUBA, the sim winner.  This choice sims a couple of points ahead of 10D SUBTAXA and any of the I8 bingos.  It's still winning 89%.
>Orry_Swift: HKW F7 H.WK +24 43
>Jim_Burlant: ?BGNSTU 11D BUSTiNG +83 185
#note This is best, and there was an unexpected benefit to this choice.
>Orry_Swift: ?CEEFSU K5 FEsCUES +114 157
>Orry_Swift: ?CEEFSU --  -114 43
#note I was 50/50 about whether this was good, but two things pushed me to challenge.  First, the vast majority of ING words don't take an S in OWL.  Secondly, this was 114 points; just too many to not challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: EILNRRT H10 L.NTER +18 203
#note There are no reallly good options here, and given that this rack needed to be turned, I didn't see the point in something like TRIM H5, and the sim agrees.  Even against an inferred rack of CEEFSU?, TRIM sims way down the list.  As for this play, NITRIL H10 is a slightly better choice due to leave considerations - I couldn't think of it.  NITRIL wins the sim.
>Orry_Swift: ?CEEFSU I2 FEsCUES +80 123
>Jim_Burlant: EGIORRY 12A GORY +34 237
#note Best.  Sim says YOGI in this same spot, leaving ERR, is also worth consideration.  I'd rather unload the duplicated R.
>Orry_Swift: GV 6H G.V +15 138
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIPRY H1 YEP +33 270
#note Quackle says I should also unload the I with YIPE for 8 more.  While this worked out for me, the duck is correct - too many scoreboard points given up here.
>Orry_Swift: ACLNOSZ 14B CALZON.S +92 230
#note Beautiful play!  Despite closing back within 40, Orry's winning chances are still only 17%.  But not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIORT 13H .ERATOID +73 343
#note The only playable bingo, and it wins 94%.
>Orry_Swift: IINO O11 IO.IN +21 251
>Jim_Burlant: ADDOPRT N10 RAD.O +25 368
#note The right idea with the wrong execution.  PODIA N10 scores 37 and is the best play.  I didn't see it.
>Orry_Swift: EVW K12 W.VE +10 261
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINPT L8 DIPNE. +32 400
#note Benefitting from last turn's mistake.  If  I play PODIA, what do I do with my rack of DEEINRT on this turn?   DIET for 20, only turning 3 tiles? Anyway, this is clearly best. Given my lead, I want to maximize turnover.
>Orry_Swift: AEEMNST K1 MEANEST +76 337
>Jim_Burlant: AAEJRRT G2 RAJA +24 424
#note The sim prefers RAJ or L1 AREA, and docks me a couple of points for turning the extra A with RAJA.  I'd rather not give him the chance to back-hook RAJ with that unseen A.  Championship Player, on the other hand, says this is best.  I opted for RAJA due to turnover.
>Orry_Swift: EHU J9 HU.E. +17 354
>Jim_Burlant: AEIOORT M4 OORIE +9 433
#note Just in case there was some obscure low-probability bingo I didn't know in his remaining letters, I was taking no chances with the win; I was more interested in guaranteeing that he couldn't bingo out.  For someone who knows all the words with 100% certainty, 1K MOIRE looks right - the 3 unseen I's give me a good chance of drawing into an out play of IOTA. 
>Orry_Swift: DEFIILT 8A IF +28 382
#note Orry told me after the game that this was his rack; had I not sealed off row 1 with RAJA a couple of turns ago, he'd have won the game with FIDELITY 1A for 98.
>Jim_Burlant: AIT 15E AI +15 448
#note NAOI 4L blocks his out.  This choice flubs 7 points of spread.
>Orry_Swift: DEILT N1 TILDE +17 399
>Orry_Swift:  (T) +2 401
#note Final score recorded 449 - 401.
