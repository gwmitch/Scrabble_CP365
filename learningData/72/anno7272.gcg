>Glenn_Filzer: JNU 8G JUN +20 20
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFOOOT G6 DO.O +14 14
#note I really don't like AFOOT.
>Glenn_Filzer: GLP 9E GL.P +11 31
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFOST 10H OAF +19 33
#note Best.  Rightfully passed of SOFTA.  Another option if OF, but that's rather speculative.  Wonder if SOFTA would get a challenge?
>Glenn_Filzer: BCEEIRS 6G .ESCRIBE +71 102
#note ICEBER(G)S.  Still, -_-.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEINST O4 CEDIS +48 81
#note If I'm Winter, I play DISCENT* in two seconds.  Unfortunately, I don't have his knack for pulling off phonies, especially for someone I don't have a read on.  So, I'm happy with CEDIS.  3rd behind CISTED and EDICTS, and it looks like it should be phony.
>Glenn_Filzer: ?AEHORS 11B HOARSEn +73 175
#note There is no karma or justice in Scrabble.  -_-  He missed like 12 better plays too, including WARHORSE for 97.
>Ryan_Fischer: GINOPTU 12A PONG +33 114
#note Doubly crappy 'cause he blocked POUTING with his own bullshit luckbox bingo.  OTU is better than ITU.  Should't been PING.  TONGU(E) H1 27 opens things up more, gives me more of a chance, I guess.
>Glenn_Filzer: EEY 13A EYE +31 206
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILOTU 8A LUTEA +21 135
#note Well, my rack woulda been even shittier had I played PING.  OUTLI(E) is way better than LUTEA, but I'm still in trouble either way.
>Glenn_Filzer: ADEENTT D1 ATTENDE. +70 276
#note And then he said "there's the hat trick."  First, don't coffeehouse.  Second, could you be anymore rude or lucky?  You missed (B)ATTENED, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: INOSTUW 6B WU. +15 150
#note Wow, I can't believe this is best!  I was about to play TOWNI(E) but I couldn't see myself coming back after that.  And I didn't think he'd buy OUTWINS*.
>Glenn_Filzer: IRYZ 2B RI.ZY +50 326
#note Just when I thought he couldn't get any more annoying or rude, he announced his score as "fifty big ones!"  Shut.  Up.  And side note, stop counting your score aloud as if you're just learning how to add, and it's unnecessary to punctuate your score with "points."  Yes, we're working under a points-based system.  Not rubles, dollars, deutchmarks, zenny, doits, or any other arbitrary unit of measure.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADINOST M6 .ANDITOS +78 228
#note Finally.  Best, though it's bad that I didn't think to look at DIATRONS/INTRADOS and SEDATION.  I'm sure I would've had I not seen BANDITOS.  Of note: A(Z)IDO 41.
>Glenn_Filzer: AAGUV 13H GUAVA. +11 337
#note It's subpar plays like this which keep me alive (even though it does take out that weak line)!  AA 14A 29.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALMNOTW 1F MOWN +34 262
#note Didn't think he'd buy TOW(E)LMAN*.
>Glenn_Filzer: IINV J2 VINI. +18 355
#note It's better to play this horizontally.  This'll set up more luckboxy badness for him.
>Ryan_Fischer: AELLMRT L12 M.LL +22 284
#note Wow, 10A MALL 28.  Doesn't create a line, though.
>Glenn_Filzer: BEI 15J BI.E +6 361
#note I love the smell of weak, subpar, fear-based play in the morning.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAERRT A12 ..AR +18 302
#note Yeah, TA is great.  But I think I need the bingo more than the points, so (PE)AR, setting up another lane and balancing, will have to do.
>Glenn_Filzer: IQ I3 QI +44 405
#note And OF COURSE, he luckboxes into a Q bomb he set up with his own careless play, locking my disconnected 9 in the process!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEKORT 1A TAK. +32 334
#note Ov(E)RTAKE(N) was the 9, if you didn't see it.
