>Jeffrey_Jacobson: BDEOO 8D BOOED +22 22
#note This game will not be pretty.  Unlike the last where I got luckboxed, in this one I fell asleep at the wheel.  Look away now.  You have been warned.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEGRZ 7C ZAG +30 30
#note Of course, by my telling you to look away, you're more likely to click through and tough it out, aren't you?  :)  First major error -- couldn't convince myself REGLAZE(D) was good.  Ow.  Also, (B)EGAZE.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: FIIINTY 7G FINITY +29 51
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: FIIINTY --  -29 22
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEFNQR 6D FEN +20 50
#note FEN in either spot is fine.  I got a bit confused 'cause he made the off-handed comment that he had the I for INFINITY, so I wanted to make sure not to put the N out too far.  So I opted for the worse placement.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: FIIINTY 7G FIN +23 45
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEHOQR J6 HOER +22 72
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: IY F4 YI. +6 51
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ENOQTY -OQY +0 72
#note Q suggests YON or x just Q.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AGIL K3 GLIA +15 66
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEINTU K8 rETINUE +65 137
#note Forgot T(YIN).  Of course remembered AYIN and PYIN which didn't matter.  rEUNITE or qUIETEN.  I picked this 'cause maybe he wouldn't know it takes a D.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: ILW 4I WI.L +14 80
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEORRY M3 OYER +25 162
#note Well, I did right it picking this best play and stopping his legitimate bingo.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: ENNRSTU 15E TUNNERS +78 158
#note But bad, BAD Scrabble player in allowing this crap to stay!  Got it confused with TUNNIES, and didn't think through that TUNNY is valid, and STUNNER doesn't have an anagram.  RUNN(I)EST does play, but that shouldn't factor into anything.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHJOOR 3E HAJ +28 190
#note I really hated this play, leaving two Os.  HOORA(Y) or JOE(Y) is the answer!
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AM 14E AM +22 180
>Ryan_Fischer: DEKLOOR 11F DOORL.KE +63 253
>Ryan_Fischer: DEKLOOR --  -63 190
#note 13B LOOKED 38.  Not this crap.  :]
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AGIILSW 12E SWAILI.G +76 256
#note And then actually have the courage to challenge this crap, too.  Grr.  SWALE and SWAIL are both NOUNS.  A tract of land.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEKLOOR 11D LOOK +31 221
#note This looks good at first glance, but gives back way too much!
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: EOTV 10F VOTE +39 295
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDDEMTX N1 DEX +31 252
#note I forget my leave.  This is close enough.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AIP 1L PA.I +30 325
>Ryan_Fischer: CDIMRST 4C RIM. +25 277
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: BCU C2 CU.B +16 341
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACDSTU 9A CUDS +18 295
#note Wow, TA(BOOED) is actually kinda awesome, opening a new lane and scoring better than my play does!  Not even a champ play, but the top evaled one.  Only problem is the leave is subpar.  Champ, here, is brilliant, finding DU(C)T, too, leaving ACS? and TWO spots for bingos, upping the tally to three!  :)  Simming those place for a bit finds DUCT first, then my CUDS, then TABOOED.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: ADQ B8 Q.AD +16 357
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAESTT 5M .T +2 297
#note Nothing doing, so, I figured I'd create a spot he can't use and pray.  (HA)A(R) is another cool play, creating an S hook.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: EENTV A11 EVENT +39 396
#note He rightly deduced he could outrun my bingo.  I wonder if that'd be the case if I hit with the P?  86 points?
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAEOST O5 AErOSAT +71 368
#note 71+10=81 vs 86+6 = 92.  11 point difference.  Closer, but no cigar.  Lesson learned.  Challenge bad words and don't play them yourself when you opponent has good reason to challenge.  :)
