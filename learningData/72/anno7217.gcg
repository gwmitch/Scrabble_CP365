>Verbie: AIIPSTU H6 PIU +10 10
#note H7 is a better slot here, by 1.7
>Conrad_B-B: ?DILOOT I4 LOID +16 16
#note Second best to I3 OOTID (-4.5)
>Verbie: AAEISTT J7 SATIATE +63 73
#note Short-armed due to hook blindness.  -10 to 3I (S-LOID)
>Conrad_B-B: ?AOOOTV 4F OVO.O +9 25
#note Best that could be hoped for out of this nasty draw.
>Verbie: BDMMNOY K8 BONY +36 109
#note umm... yeah, BODY fits there too.  (-3.5)  Strangely MONY is also better, by .7
>Conrad_B-B: ?AERRST L4 RETeARS +76 101
#note Nice, but the real star is STARkER L6.  (-5)
>Verbie: ADMMRWX M5 MAX +42 151
#note Finally one of us gets one totally right.
>Conrad_B-B: ACORVYZ 5C CAVY +29 130
#note Sure, COZY (3/5)C is better, but by only 4.  The V is really that bad.  COVARY is also worth a look here (1 behind COZY)
>Verbie: DEMRRSW I10 DREW +34 185
#note Nuts, it fit at N3 for 1 more.  And what looks like a smaller defensive liability...
>Conrad_B-B: AEEOQRZ H12 RAZE +52 182
#note ... especially after this!
>Verbie: AEMNORS G8 MO +9 194
#note Should have been disastrous, as I miss AMARONES on line D.  (-40)  If I'm going to miss, at least drop MEMO 5K.
>Conrad_B-B: DEGLNOQ N1 LONGED +37 219
#note Or DONGLE% 14J.  But I'd rather not leave an E in a TWSTWS corridor.  Especially not 7th.
>Verbie: AEGJNRS 1J JANG.E +45 239
#note D1 JAGRA is only 1 weaker.
>Conrad_B-B: EEHHKQS C3 HE.K +26 245
>Verbie: IPRRSTU O6 STIRRUP +91 330
#note Nice one.
>Conrad_B-B: ?EHIQS 13M QIS +34 279
#note Not sure what the other one was.
>Verbie: ACDEGNU 10A UNCAGED +71 401
#note I spent so much time convincing myself to play it that I didn't see the better spot, 2A (C-HECK) (-21)
>Conrad_B-B: ?AEEHIT D1 HIE +15 294
#note Going for the home-run here, passing up HErNIATE B7 (if I'm reading this right)
>Verbie: EIILNNO 14K LOIN +23 424
#note Quackle doesn't think the A-line is a threat.  Neither did I.  Not with that jumble out there.  This is a bit of a gladiator play, daring Conrad to beat me.  (-1 to INION 2G, best block is INULIN, 7 back)
>Conrad_B-B: ?AEFLTU A8 FA.TEUiL +149 443
#note Dayum, he hit it!
>Verbie: BEIINTW 1C W.ITEN +36 460
#note Best of the choices, but this one's in the red column.
>Conrad_B-B: EF 14F FE. +23 466
>Conrad_B-B:  (BI) +8 474
