>Jim_Burlant: ?KLORRU 8G LURK +16 16
#note There are no bingos here, and this choice sims best.  I have the blank, why not be more aggressive and open up a potential 2x2?
>Orry_Swift: FLOSTY K8 SOFTLY +33 33
#note Play incorrectly scored as 35.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEORU 12F AUREO.Ae +66 82
#note Any number of bingos here.  Sim gives slight preference to AUREOLAs...and I think it's right.
>Orry_Swift: FIQR F11 F.QIR +19 52
#note Not knowing the rest of Orry's rack, the sim does not like Orry's choice.  And, despite my having drawn a fresh 7, the sim isn't the only entity about to punish Orry.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGNNT 14C ANT.GENE +61 143
#note The other playable bingo is G2 ENTANGLE, which I didn't see.  This choice, which sims at marginally lower valuation than ENTANGLE, has roughly 1/2% greater winning chances than ENTANGLE.
>Orry_Swift: MO 15F .OM +30 82
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEMOS 15A MOB +25 168
#note Sim winner is 15J DEMOBS, which I didn't nkow.  Couldn't think of BODE, as I was too intent on unloading both the B and the M.  15A BODE is much safer as something like HAJ can't burn me for 50.
>Orry_Swift: CIIR D10 RICI. +14 96
>Jim_Burlant: ADEELSS D10 .....S +18 186
#note There are no bingos here.  A bunch of 13J plays are the standouts here.  DYES wins, with this choice simiming roughly 4 points down.
>Orry_Swift: AAINORT G1 RATIONA. +60 156
>Jim_Burlant: AADEELS 3B DEALA.ES +70 256
#note This is the only playable bingo, and it wins 91%.  To this point I've played a decent - not great, not terrible - game.  But, for reasons I cannot explain, my brain goes on vacation for the rest of this game.  Warning - this gets pretty pitiful.
>Orry_Swift: Z 2F Z. +62 218
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGIPV H2 P.D +27 283
#note I couldn't think of REIVE or REGIVE, and rejected RIVED because I didn't like the potential for something like HEAVY 2J as a comeback.  So my solution is to create an even more dangerous spot?   Can someone please find my brain and return it to me? 1G REGIVE is the obvious winner here.   The sim makes clear how terrible this play is - probably the worst play I made this entire tournament.
>Orry_Swift: WW D2 W.W +18 236
>Jim_Burlant: EEGINUV 6E VE.UE +10 293
#note Best choice is another common word I couldn't think of, B1 ENDIVE.  This play sims decently, but not great.  It has the virtue of unloading both the V and the U but still gives up too much on the scoreboard.
>Orry_Swift: CDEIIT 15J DIETIC +33 269
>Jim_Burlant: EGINOSX 1G .OE +30 323
#note I held his play of DIETIC* and was 50/50 on it.  But he'd just drawn 6, and I was concerned: if I lost the challenge would he hit me with something like RAJ on row 1 for 50?  I was preoccupied with cleaning up from my PED blunder, and since I could block and score 30, that was the first spot I chose to address.  While I gave serious consideration to EX 14M, I ultimately decided the X could wait.  1G ROSING, which I didn't know, is the sim winner. This choice is mid pack.   Against his next rack, EX would have definitely been the best play.
>Orry_Swift: ?DIINPU M6 UNPItI.D +72 341
#note After the game, Orry told me he wasn't sure enough about PUNDItIC to put it down.  It's good, and it would have scored 89 to this play's 72- a difference of 17 points.  Make a note of that number.
>Jim_Burlant: GIJNRSX 8M .IX +36 359
#note JINX!!!!!!
>Orry_Swift: AENTV B2 A.VENT +24 365
>Jim_Burlant: AGJNORS 8B SOJA +30 389
#note Can someone please explain to me how I can not see JARGON in this rack even if the bingo doesn't play?
>Orry_Swift: HLOT N3 LOTH +28 393
>Jim_Burlant: EEGGNR 11B GR.E. +18 407
#note Incredible luck to land the only two remaining vowels in the pool, and this clinches the win for me.  This particular play is best.  One other consideration here:  once again, I'm very low on time; I had 10 seconds left on my clock when I put this down.
>Orry_Swift: BHY 4M H.Y +13 406
#note Difference in the final score:  17 points.  If Orry finds PUNDITIC a few turns back, we tie.   Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: EGN 5I NEG +10 417
#note 9F GEN scores 17.  I had all of 5 seconds on my clock when I put this play down, and while he'd taken the time to work out his end game, I figured out that my play was enough to win, that's all I cared about.
>Jim_Burlant:  (B) +6 423
#note Difference in the game:  UNPITIED instead of PUNDITIC.  He drew tiles that left him no margin for anything less than 0-equity loss play; I played like an idiot and still won.
