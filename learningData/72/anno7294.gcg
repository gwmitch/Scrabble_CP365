>Jim: ADEIRSX 8H RADIXES +96 96
#note Off to a good start!  Could this be the game where the curse is finally broken?
>Chris: ELMOUUV H6 VE.MOULU +64 64
#note Well at least I have a good dump at N2.  Oh wait...
>Jim: HOP 7K HOP +32 128
>Chris: ?AGILTY 12H .eGALITY +80 144
>Jim: CFO M10 CO.F +18 146
>Chris: ?BGHINU O10 BU.ING +36 180
>Jim: ADEELRS 14B DEALERS +84 230
>Jim: ADEELRS --  -84 146
#note I was hoping this might happen.  Luckily for me, there were no valid spots for this bingo.  (VERMOULU is an adjective that means "worm-eaten.")  Quackle suggests 7K HOPE.
>Chris: ?HINORT 15H TORcHIN. +95 275
#note Lucky.
>Jim: ADEELRS 6J DAL +24 170

#note or 13G JUN
>Jim: EV J10 VE. +17 187
>Chris: AACDENS N4 CADE. +21 316
#note Best!  This is the only way to score without opening up the board for my opponent.  Now the most likely bingo spot is at 7A which is likely to be low scoring and set me up for good counterplay.
>Jim: AEIOUYZ O5 AE +7 194
>Chris: AEINSTT 9A TETANIS. +62 378
#note After the game, I was surprised to learn that this word isn't good.  I must've picked it up from browsing medical dictionaries.  I did see the TETANISE/ANISETTE combo, but missed ENTASTIC (which I didn't see) and TETANICS (which I didn't know).  Fortunately he didn't challenge.
>Jim: AEIORST A5 TOAS.IER +77 271
#note Then again, if he had challenged, he wouldn't have had this.
>Chris: AEKLNRZ 7G L.Z +44 422
#note ZEK at 8D scores another 11, but I preferred to save the K for the O5 spot.  The duck approves.
>Jim: MOP B4 MOP +25 296
>Chris: ADEKNRY 4L YA.K +48 470
#note Yay!
>Jim: EINTW C2 TWINE +28 324
>Chris: DEFGNRR B9 .F +26 496
#note Hoping for one of those three E's in the bag.
>Jim: IQ B1 QI +26 350
>Chris: DEEGNRR D6 DER.NGER +79 575
#note This is a silly word.  (In French, it means "to disturb.")
>Jim: ABEEOUW 3K WAB +29 379
>Chris: EISU 9A ........S +25 600
#note 14D SEI followed by M10 CUB is a few points better for my spread, but at this point I'm just trying to maximize the score.
>Jim: ENOO E9 .OON +18 397
#note Best would be to play MOPE B4, which denies me the best spot for my E, and go out with K2 ONO
>Chris: EIU B4 ...E +10 610
>Jim: E 14N E. +8 405
>Jim:  (IU) +4 409
#note The curse still stands.  For now.  Jim would eventually break it when he handed me my only loss at the 6/26/06 one-day tournament in Seattle.
