>Verbie: AIIJNOS H4 JOINS +40 40
#note JIAO H7 is actually half a point better depite only scoring 22.  Keeping the N and S is worth that much.
>Darrell_Day: ENOT 4H .ETON +24 24
>Verbie: ADFIINY 3I NIDIFY +38 78
#note Sweet save, and amazingly only 3 ahead of the next option- 5H OFAY, which I can't fathom.
>Darrell_Day: ETU 2K UTE +15 39
>Verbie: AEGIOTU 8A AGOUTIE. +80 158
#note Would have been embarassing to miss this- the next option is 67 back.  Which would have been the worst miss I'd have ever known about.
>Darrell_Day: AEZ B8 .AZE +34 73
>Verbie: AEEFHLN C11 FEH +23 181
#note This isn't even the best on line C (ALEF), but the star is 7A NAH. (-7)
>Darrell_Day: ??CDEOT E5 COa.TEnD +86 159
#note There were more obvious bingos.  I think he was trying to draw a challenge.
>Verbie: AAELNPW D12 LAW +25 206
#note Missing the AGAZE hook again.  7A PAW is much better.  (-17)  
>Darrell_Day: AALNV 15D NAVAL +35 194
>Verbie: AAENPTV 5K NEAP +26 232
#note Am I going to put every single A on someplace other than 7B?  PAT 7A is top.  (-7)
>Darrell_Day: EIORS O4 OSIER +25 219
>Verbie: AAELTTV 2F VELA +18 250
#note (-12)  Even though the only thing I can do in line 7 is AT 7B, that's best.  Darrell's probably wondering why I'm flinging As into worthless spaces.
>Darrell_Day: IKN 1M KIN +31 250
>Verbie: AIMQRTT 1G RAM +29 279
#note (-9) to guess what... TAM at guess where... 7A.
>Darrell_Day: BILOO N8 OBOLI +11 261
>Verbie: AIIPQTT M12 QAT +35 314
#note That's the end of the As.  But why am I keeping two Is?  At least they're the last two.  (-4 to QI)
>Darrell_Day: ERSU 15L USER +28 289
>Verbie: CDIIOPT 10D C.DI +11 325
#note (-68)  to EPIDOTIC here.  I don't think I'd ever seen it, but at least come up with DICOT A11 (20 better than this felt-ripper).
>Darrell_Day: ERY A11 RYE +16 305
>Verbie: BDIOPTX C7 B.X +40 365
#note Yay, I hit one right!
>Darrell_Day: D 6H .D +3 308
>Verbie: GHIOPTW B13 POW +25 390
#note (-7) to WHAP A6
>Darrell_Day: EGMRRSU 6D G.R +6 314
#note Not sure where this came from.  On the other hand it leaves SERUM for K11.  On the other other hand, that was the right play NOW.
>Verbie: GHIT A6 GH.T +18 408
#note How the shpx did I win this game?
>Darrell_Day: EMRSU J6 SERUM +21 335
#note K11 and J6 are identical in effect.
>Darrell_Day:  (I) +2 337
