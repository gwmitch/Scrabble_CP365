>N_Walton: HINOOOU -HINOOOU +0 0
#note I would have kept HIN.  Quackle rates this second best, and the actual choice 6th behind keeping HN.
>Verbie: AILRRSU H4 RURAL +12 12
#note Should at least have seen URARI, but better still is URIAL H8.  (-6)
>N_Walton: ?CIMNNR 5G M.CIN +18 18
#note I didn't know CRINUM either.  (-1.3)
>Verbie: EEIRSTY 7F YE.STIER +64 76
#note Top.  G7 YE is 15 back, if I was into trying to upgrade.
>N_Walton: ?ACDNRU 4K ADUNC +24 42
#note Noah apparently tries to upgrade on a bingo, but with CANDoUR or DURANCe scoring 78 on line 3 (C-RURAL), this was sub-optimal.  (-22)
>Verbie: AIORUWW 6L WOW +24 100
#note Best I could do on short notice.  It actually is tops, by 1.7 over CURIO O4.
>N_Walton: ?IIORTX 3M XI +38 80
#note Operation Upgrade backfires.  But the duck approves of this reload attempt.
>Verbie: AAGIORU 4C GIAOU. +18 118
#note Very obvious.  Next choice is 9 back.
>N_Walton: ?FHIORT 5A FROTH +37 117
#note Best by about 6 over HO 2N.
>Verbie: ABJLMNR 8L BALM +47 165
#note Best by 1.5 over BARM.  Best not involving 8L is LAMB/ BALM 3D, 13 back.
>N_Walton: ?AAILPZ 3A PLAZA +58 175
#note OW!  Best by 3 over ZA 2N.  PIAZzA 8A is interesting too, just 1.3 back.  
>Verbie: IIJNORU A5 .UJI +42 207
#note Nothing else is even close.  Wishing I had a second O so I could land JOURNO%.
>N_Walton: ?BDEHIO B5 .HO +36 211
#note Four straight tops for Noah.  
>Verbie: DDIKNOR A1 KO. +27 234
#note Sixth best top for the fellow in the blue corner.
>N_Walton: ?ABDEII C7 BIDI +27 238
#note Co-top with BI here.  I's are depleted, so it's not as damaging to leave one.
>Verbie: ADDEINR M6 ...D +7 241
#note OOPS.  Didn't believe SARDINED%.  (-31.5, but 3rd best)
>N_Walton: ?AEEIOY -EEIOY +0 238
#note Leaves one well wide.  2N YE is the class act.  (-11.5)
>Verbie: ADEGINR J7 .READING +66 307
#note Shortarmed this one, should see MARGINED or MIDRANGE O8.  (-23)
>N_Walton: ?AEENTT 11E ATTEN.Ed +82 320
#note The only advantage over the other DWS-DWS hitters is the lack of S-hook.  (ATTEND-Ee, eE, Er, or EE with the blank E internal.)
>Verbie: ?INOQVY B10 QuOIN +97 404
#note I'm not surprised that this is better than QI here.  (by 10)  I was trying to cut down angles on bingos to the N or G.
>N_Walton: EEFGOOR 13D FOREGO.E +64 384
#note The only bingo.  Not much I could do to block *that*.
>Verbie: EENTVVY 12A V.TE +32 436
#note Got this one right.
>N_Walton: AEEELST 14D TEEL +20 404
#note -6 to STELAE 15B.
>Verbie: ENPSSVY 15F ESPY +33 469
#note Considered ENVY 12L until I realized it would give a better out-play.
>N_Walton: AES F7 .EAS. +10 414
#note Already pointed out O6 SAME for 6 more.
>N_Walton:  (NSV) +12 426
