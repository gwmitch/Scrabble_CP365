>Matthew_Larocque: AGJNTXY H8 TANGY +26 26
#note Uh, well, I didn't know JANTY. Sadly.
>Mike_Ryan: HOW I7 HOW +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: AACJLSX 6G JACAL +28 54
#note Champ player ranks this third behind AWA/AX or AWA/AXAL. I'd still prefer to keep the X as it's more versatile for scoring with.
>Mike_Ryan: EENN J8 ENNE +15 43
#note He said later he meant to play NENE. I chose to leave it since it set up my X pretty good.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLNSX K9 SEX +47 101
#note Champ player says it's worth using the S here. I wasn't sure really.
>Mike_Ryan: AKQU 12D QUAK. +42 85
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLNPTY F10 PL.TY +24 125
#note YELP at J5 was the other option I was thinking about. Champ player likes it. I was oblivious to SEX(Y), sadly. Yet I took note of SEX(T), *shrug*.
>Mike_Ryan: EF G9 FE +29 114
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGGNRT 14B RAGG. +20 145
#note So, my reasoning here was that no Rs have been played yet, making RAGG(Y) > NAGG(Y). Champ player likes a number of T-words hooking onto SEX. NAGG(Y) also appears at #5, but RAGG(Y) doesn't rank. It did end up working out in my favour, fortunately.
>Mike_Ryan: EPZ 5J ZEP +43 157
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDEENT A8 ENDiTED +89 234
#note The worst of the 3 bingo options, TrENDED apparently wins 84% compared to 80% for this play. I usually just go with the bingo that is least common, having the best chance of drawing a hold so they waste some time thinking about the validity of a word. DRAGGY was the word he was holding on, he told me after.
>Mike_Ryan: OW 4L OW +18 175
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIOSU 9A .AOI +5 239
#note This felt like a bad play, but champ player considers it best along with M3 AI and Exch. AIOU. 
>Mike_Ryan: UUVV -UUVV +0 175
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEORSU 3M OUR +16 255
#note Ok this was absurdly bad. Somehow I thought AROUSE required double Rs. Other than that, there's a number of other bingos that I probably should know. I really haven't gotten very deep into bingos yet. Hence I usuallly need gobs of good draws to beat Mike.
>Mike_Ryan: T 3L T... +9 184
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEOSV 7E AVO +17 272
#note Not blocking the the triple-triple here was pretty careless considering his fishy play. Even though I've got a bingo coming, the leave from playing AVO isn't worth the risk. VA(R)A was the other play I was considering, which champ player ranks #2. SOAVE/PLATYS. Damn, I had an inkling that PLATY was one of those funny S-hookable words.
>Mike_Ryan: CEEINST 2F ENTICES +73 257
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEFIS 1C FAErIES +91 363
#note I'm pretty low on time at this point - I saw this bingo very quickly, and never even explored the triple-triple lane. Nooooooooooo! *facepalm*
>Mike_Ryan: DMO O1 DO.M +30 287
>Matthew_Larocque: BBIMRRS C1 .IRM +18 381
#note Yeah, this sucks. I was sort of in a rush to finish the game before I found a way to lose it.
>Mike_Ryan: EI O1 ....IE +9 296
>Matthew_Larocque: BBRSUUV N6 BUR +21 402
#note I wasn't sure on BUBU - which would have been tons better. Or that nice PLATY hook to make SUBURB!
>Mike_Ryan: ADIIO 6A OIDIA +10 306
>Matthew_Larocque: BLORSUV 8L BU.O +27 429
>Matthew_Larocque: BLORSUV --  -27 402
#note My failure of 4 letter words is exposed again. BURL? BURR? I wasn't sure on either, and I figured BURRO was the spelling. Although Mike was also low on time, he removed this promptly. Also, PLATY hook remains available, and I kind of forgot about trying it for the rest of the game.
>Mike_Ryan: HIILNRT 4C .IRTH +20 326
#note Mike must have forgot about SEX(T) here, but he spent a ton of time on this play. 
>Matthew_Larocque: BLORSUV C13 V.U +12 414
>Mike_Ryan: ILN 2B L.N +8 334
>Matthew_Larocque: BLORS 6G .....S +22 436
#note SO(R)B appears to be the best non-PLATYS play.
>Mike_Ryan: I 4K I.. +9 343
>Mike_Ryan: I --  -9 334
#note Uh... 
And there's a legit play that scores more than this.
>Matthew_Larocque: BLOR 8M O.B +15 451
#note Wasn't sure about BURR. Awesome.
>Mike_Ryan: I 1N I. +3 337
>Mike_Ryan:  (LR) +4 341
#note We both went overtime, but I don't really have an excuse to do so here. It would be nice to finish a game without such stupid plays....
