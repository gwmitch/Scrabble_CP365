#note SIEVE O4 was tempting, but taking this hotspot seemed more important, and the leave was much better.
>Evans: AWY F2 YAW +30 371
>Joey: EEINOSV A7 .OVE +18 352
#note SIEVE was available again, but with a rather ominous looking tile pool, I preferred a shorter play again.

#note I thought about passing up the bingo because of the still ugly tile pool, but figured I would be in more trouble if I didn't draw one.
>Evans: DLLLSUV O11 V.LDS +27 434
#note Evans discovered after the game that DELL wins, since it sets up two spots for LUVS.  And wouldn't you know it, the Wisconsins Dells is (are?) this weekend!  What a coincidence!  What a game!  What a tournament!  What excessive use of exclamation points.
