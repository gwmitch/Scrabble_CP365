#note So there are some plays here that I didn't see. Namely, MANURES J9 and ANEURISM 12C. MANURES seems to let the board fly open, while this is easier to close. I'm not sure though.

#note I am not sure whether he has a T. I don't think TAT necessarily indicates it, although it seems likely, and he definitely has an S.

#note I'm not too good at these types of plays. What I need to do here is generate a long list of plays, and start eliminating. ZOO, LOTION, WOOLIER, ONE, WOE, NOO, an ONO all seem worth considering. WOE bingos with 20 tiles, and 19 if he blocks LENTIGO N12. Quackle says EILNT is just as good for bingoing. ONE and WOOLIER don't really accomplish much. Maybe ZOO is right here. I don't have any strong justfication for a specific play here, but ZOO is the strongest for bingoing.

#note I wonder about EQUINE here. I don't think I like the scoring spot it gives back, but this seems to offer more bingos. I'd probably still go with this. There's only one E left.

#note I think Mike has more bingos in row 5 than in column M, so I blocked that lane.

#note Still wins against FAIRIES. Quackle says 3H (I)N will give me a much higher average spread, though.
