>Jim_Burlant: ILMNOOS M5 OINOM.LS +64 137
#note Q prefers SIMOLEON M5 by roughly 1/2 point.  Whatever.  This wins 61%.
>Lewis_Saul: ?AEHIRT -  +0 89
#note I know Lewis's rack because of his next turn.  He lost his turn challenging OINOMELS.
>Jim_Burlant: AAANORT L4 ANOA +14 151
#note Best.  The runner up, 9L AMA, sims nearly 4 points down.
>Lewis_Saul: ?AEHIRT 5B HAIRnET +80 169
#note OMG, I had never seen that hook.  I held this play, but released it when I saw what it gave me back.  I did well to let this go, as TENTERED is good. 
>Jim_Burlant: AEQRTUV D2 AQU.VER +40 191
#note BAD miss.  4A QUATE scores 61 and is clearly best; I missed it.  Too fixated on unloading the V.  Quate wins 62%; this play, which is the runner up, wins 51 but really - like I said, this is BAD.
>Lewis_Saul: DEILNO N2 INDOLE +29 198
>Jim_Burlant: CMOOSTU B1 COUT. +20 211
#note Another lame play.  All I could find were B1 plays like MOOCH and this.  How do I miss 8A MUCRO or even B2 MUCHO?  B2 MUCHO would have been much better than this.
>Lewis_Saul: AJKORUX -AJKORU +0 198
>Jim_Burlant: AMOSTUV K7 VAU.T +23 234
#note L12 OVUM wins 71% and is best; this is the runner up, winning 65%.
>Lewis_Saul: BEIJ 12D JIBE. +30 228
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOSU C7 MOUE +19 253
#note You'll notice this is the fourth straight turn I've pulled a U.  Q likes 3B USQUE and 8A MOIRA.  Of all the choices, I like MEOU the best.  Too bad I couldn't think of it.
>Lewis_Saul: OX 13F OX +38 266
>Jim_Burlant: AAAFISS E11 A.S +16 269
#note Q doesn't particularly like this, preferring B10 FAS.  Lewis told me after the game that this play was huge, as he was going to hit me with FL(I)CK E10 40.  This also forced him into a mistake.
>Lewis_Saul: ?CFGKLS 10B K.G +18 284
#note Lewis told me his rack after the game, and he missed a huge play here:  it would have definitely been worth his while to burn the blank and play B10 FLiCK/FLoCK for 55.
>Jim_Burlant: AAFISTZ A8 ZAS +45 314
#note Q prefers ZITS for 48, presumably for turnover to get at the blank.  I'm back up to 58% winning chances.
>Lewis_Saul: ?CGHLSW -?CGH +0 284
>Jim_Burlant: AFGIIPT E2 TI +15 329
#note This choice sims mid-pack - I thought that if I rendered him unable to open up this end of row 1, he'd have to find an 8 to or through the I - not as easy as, say, having an R in 7th or 8th positoin.  Q's preference is O1 IF, which I considered.  Maybe Q is right, maybe it's not.  But given his next sequence, it may not have mattered.
>Lewis_Saul: ?ILNRSW F12 ..W +16 300
#note Given his next play, this is an inferred rack on my part.  You'll notice there's still an L in the unseen pool; if I have it, it won't be too hard to shut down what he's just opened.
>Jim_Burlant: AEFGIPT I9 F.T +21 350
#note Now I'm in serious trouble.  From his KEG play, I know he's got to have an S, he's probably sitting on the blank, and what's worse is I am utterly helpless - I don't have a block.  Q prefers G1 GIFTED and O1 IF.  I just figured that, if I couldn't block, I couldn't really turn the rack (well, GIFTED does that but that's a bad play IMO), I should just try to maximize score and hope he had a rack killing draw.
>Lewis_Saul: ?IILNRS 15D INLIeRS +80 380
#note Not that I'm playing particularly well, but this is par for the course with how most of this day had gone.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGHIP O7 DIG +24 374
#note I stayed away from APHID because I thought it took a back E (APHIDES is good, so why wouldn't APHIDE* be?), and the unseen pool made me realize that he'd hit GLEY through it as a comeback, so I nixed that.  Q says M1 PHI is my best play.  Whatever.  Maybe this turns out differently if I find QUATE or MUCRO.
