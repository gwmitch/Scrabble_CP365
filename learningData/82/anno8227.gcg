>Nigel: EEGOTUW A6 TEW +27 449
#note No way to play an endgame in speed. WO(K) is best.
>Rafi_: AIST 1A ST.AI +18 714
#note Didn't track, so I didn't know Nigel didn't have an out play. I should have just taken the risk and hoped he didn't have an out. I saw PATH, and adding QIS could have gotten me to 750, with a combined score over 1200. The clock showed 18:41 for Nigel and 21:49 for me at the end, a grand total of 9:30 used, and 1173 points!
