#note Quackle prefers plays parallel to SEAWANT. STTE is a great leave, but I don't really have a lot of places to cash in on it.

>Tunnicliffe: EENRSTT 11J TENT +27 147
#note Wanted to do something like RENT to set up my S, but I had to infer a great bingo leave for Adam too. So I took the defensive play. RENTES is a sexy overlap here.

#note Hate setting up a tile I don't have. But nothing else is close.

#note Yuck. Gross position. I spent forever here. Everything looks bad. The top-simming play is M9 LATENS... which looked so wrong to me. But really, ARSE looks wrong as well. The plan here was to draw an A for ZA, since points are so hard to come by on this board.

#note Happy to close down some dangerous spots and unload some clunkers, although other plays score better (C1 CLING).

#note With QUOITED, QUOINED, OUTVIED, etc. unseen, I had to assume GEL was fishing for one of those.

#note Yup. I pulled the D after killing DUH. Now I have to try and figure out what Adam's one-tile plays are doing. My first instinct was that he was dodging the Q. But with QUU? unseen, that seemed unlikely. So I figured he must have been fishing for something which was still playable. I figured it had to be 12A QUITE or A10 UNIQUE/UBIQUE. Turns out he also had a lot of potential stuff from IRIDs, but none of it was possible from my point of view. Adam was hitting stupid draws off his fishes.
>Logan: ?EIOQUU C1 QUa. +32 346
>Tunnicliffe: CLPTV F10 ..P +9 384
#note Stupid. Adam is down to 30 seconds here and I decided to make an instant play and put him into time pressure. Stupid considering how quickly he thinks. I should have taken a couple seconds to realise I had a spot for my V.
>Logan: EIOU 10B .U +2 348
#note Takes him 2 seconds. So much for time pressure.
>Tunnicliffe: CLTV 15L CL.. +12 396
#note Panicking with less than 2 minutes left after my error and not seeing a spot for my C. It would have been pretty disastrous if I hadn't eventually seen this.
