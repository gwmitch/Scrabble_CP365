>Cheah_Siu_Hean: BFI 8G FIB +16 16
>Toh_Weibin: ACEELOU 9B COULEE +16 16
#note Was seriously considering (FIB)ULAE - however I didn't fancy the chances of the CEO leave especially when he was going to move next.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: ADEINSS 10F SDAINES +73 89
>Toh_Weibin: AEEIMRU L4 UREMIA. +20 36
#note This or J11 AMIE would do, I think. I wanted to blast the board further open, but would not have tried something like B9 (C)ERIUM.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: GINVW C8 V.WING +26 115
>Toh_Weibin: EEOOTTU 9I OUT.TE +18 54
#note Was happy to find this.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: LVY 6K L.VY +18 133
>Toh_Weibin: ?EELORR E2 REEnROL. +64 118
#note REROlLER D5 is a four-timer that I just didn't know. I played this instead of E(N)ROLlER 12B to keep the board conducive for bingos.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: EGMR D1 GERM +30 163
>Toh_Weibin: ?EGHNOR 3C G..ENHORn +78 196
#note Might not have seen ENRO(U)GHs, if Cheah didn't open this for me.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: HO H1 HO. +27 190
>Toh_Weibin: ADIOPPT 7C AP.D +23 219
#note This is the big mistake of the game - H10 (A)PPAID is the clear best. A12 PI(N)TADO is a decent but distant second.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: BNO 1A BON. +21 211
>Toh_Weibin: AIJOPQT M2 JAP +28 247
#note Probably should have played QAT instead, since the J has a better chance of scoring on the board.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: TU 2M .UT +20 231
>Toh_Weibin: IOQRTXY 10N XI +50 297
#note Almost QUIXOTRY.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: CENST H10 .SCENT +33 264
>Toh_Weibin: EOQRTTY -OQTY +0 297
#note ASCENT reeked of strong tiles, and I thought he would be getting good scores over the next two turns. I would need at least 2 turns to get rid of the Q and the Y, and I didn't like my chances scoring 11 for the Q. What I should probably have done was play K6 (L)OT(TE)RY, closing up a few lines and maintaining a good lead.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: AADINSZ 13G Z.NAIDAS +108 372
#note It would also have blocked this.
>Toh_Weibin: ADEIORT 15H .ERATOID +80 377
#note Was lucky to get this in response, though.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: AAFILWY 12J FLAY +38 410
#note Many moves win here, but (Quackle thinks) the best is an out-in-two L12 ALIF followed by 14F WA(N)Y (which I wouldn't block).
>Toh_Weibin: EIKOQT 11B Q. +11 388
#note Was low on time and had just finished tracking Cheah's tiles - did not see the obvious spot at F2. The best play here is obviously what I'm going to notice later. B11 QI gives him an outplay.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: AIW 14F WA. +25 435
>Toh_Weibin: EIKOT F2 K.TO +41 429
#note Should have been K(E)TO first then QI.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean: I B11 .I +13 448
#note Playing the moves in the right sequence would not have allowed him to score 13 here.
>Cheah_Siu_Hean:  (EI) +4 452
