#note Best exchange.  Throwing in the T and only keeping RS sims 3 points down.
>Gregg_Speicher: HOTU 8H THOU +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: EQRSSTZ K7 Q.EST +28 28
#note Too bad I didn't have a play pluralizing THOU that didn't require me to burn both of my S's - Gregg told me post-mortem that he would have challenged - and lost his turn doing so.  Oh well, it didn't matter.  This is a no-brainer best play, unloading the Q as well as a duplicated S.  And what's really nice about it is that it doesn't telegraph that I'm sitting on another S.

#note Little did Gregg (or I, for that matter) realize that this was only the beginning.

>Jim_Burlant: BDERRSY O11 B.RRY +30 157
#note I put this down way too quickly, just slapping down the first thing I saw.   DERBY is much better than this for three reasons and the sim docks me almost 10 points for this, justifiably. First, DERBY scores 33 to this play's 30.  Secondly, the ERS leave with DERBY is superior to EDS.  Lastly, the other consideration: there are all sorts of nifty front extensions (WAXBERRY, INKBERRY, BARBERRY, etc.) that potentially allow this play to give a lot more back than I got for it.  In this game, this wound up not mattering, but DERBY should have been my play.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEFNNS M11 F.ND +26 183
#note Best, and I'm winning 83%.  And the bagging is about to begin.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEILORV 13C VARIOLE +77 188
#note Best bingo for Gregg, and he's back at 44%.   But not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADENSX 15G EXpANDS +107 290
#note Clearly best, but there were a bunch of really cool plays available elsewhere:   O8 wAXBERRY, 5G sANDBOXES or bANDBOXES.
>Gregg_Speicher: AOP 14I APO +26 214
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILMP H1 PALMIEs. +92 382
#note Without the obvious triple this would have been paralysis by 1000 choices.  Other options:  E8 PLuMERIA,  E8 LEMPiRAS, E8 IMPEARLS, 10D IMPANELS, etc.  The top 15 choices are all bingos.
>Gregg_Speicher: NNO 9J N.ON +7 221
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGIIN E8 CAGIE. +18 400
#note Too bad he didn't hang an R to let me play REAGINIC.  I really had no idea what to do here; I figured I'd just turn tiles to empty the bag as quickly as possible.  This  winds up winning the sim, though it gives up valuation to plays like 8M ICE and I2 GIE.  Of note:  N10 GA(ZOO), which I didn't see.
>Gregg_Speicher: ELNORSU 1H .LEURONS +83 304
#note Egg on my face - picked the wrong time to forget that PLEURON doesn't take S.  Gregg's best legit bingo is 2H ALEURONS.  
>Jim_Burlant: AGINTUY J4 GAY +34 434
>Gregg_Speicher: FTW D12 W.FT +32 336
>Jim_Burlant: ADIINTU 8A TUNI. +24 458
#note Shock of shocks, Q actually advocates defense with DUI 2M to shut down potential O column bingos.   I was more interested in turnover since the pool didn't seem too bingo prone, but Q is right. 2m DUI was the play.  Having said that I'm still winning 99%.
>Gregg_Speicher: AGJ 10B JAG. +29 365
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEIRW 8M AWE +20 478
#note DEWBERRY O8 would have been a sweet play had I thought to look for it.  Then again, I wouldn't have had the explosive finish I wound up having.

#note Sorry, Gregg.  There wasn't much you could do about this.
