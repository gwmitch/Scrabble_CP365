#note there's a bunch of moves that are better than mine, but i didn't want to block up the board with FERIA, so that can't be right, and i didn't really see what else i could do. 10I OBIA is probably the best choice though. -7.5

#note torn between starting over and trying another fish here. 12K OBI sims best, but i didn't feel like i could afford a miss again. 9B BOATER is probably best. i like just blowing up the board and seeing if i can catch up another way. -2.5

#note as soon as i held him alan realized this was a phony he'd played before and i knew he'd do indevout next. lucky for me, but he has a D and i'm not sure about the glaring hook myself.

#note my play doesn't sim very well with the inference due to THE HOOK. dammit. -6.5. exchange and keep the E.

>cesar: BEKNOUZ -  +0 333
#note even though i still have a decent shot at winning the game, it felt like too many points to not challenge. it also takes an R! BUNKO 2F sims best. -39

#note i spent most of the remaining time on the clock here. i have a 1/10 chace of drawing the letter i need. there's a whole bunch more bingos with fishing off UK, but it didn't seem to me as if i'd be able to win the game, being down by so much, without scoring a lot here and hoping for a miracle.
