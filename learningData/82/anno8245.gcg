>Tunnicliffe: DMORTVW M7 VROW +25 25
#note VOWED is good too. Was kind of hoping for a challenge on the hook.
>Barclay: AAENP L10 APNEA +19 39
>Tunnicliffe: DIILMNT 13G LIMIT.D +28 53
#note Stupid. I talked myself out of APNEAL. But as soon as I played, I realised I know APNOEAL the bingo. So duh.

>Tunnicliffe: AINOSUW K10 WO +27 80
>Barclay: ATX 12F TAX +37 109
>Tunnicliffe: AEIINSU G8 .UI +5 85
#note This play is awful. It does so much damage to the board when I am trying to bingo on it. I12 AMIA is fine.
>Barclay: Q 10F Q. +31 140

#note I11 RAM for points. Making some silly plays this game.
>Barclay: BN H7 B.N +7 160
>Tunnicliffe: AEGINRS 14A EARINGS +77 174
#note SERINGA is probably safer.

>Barclay: AMU 13C AMU +20 201
>Tunnicliffe: ?FIKTTU 10C KI +14 216
#note This play looks weird, but Wayne is down to 7 minutes at this point, and playing KI instead of something like KUFI, TITI, TUFT or whatever basically ensures that this game is going to have a lot of turns and that I might be able to pressure his clock.

#note Turns out he didn't have the S, but I had to infer it.

#note Stupid. UT is fine, since it doesn't give back...
