>Joey_Krafchick: EJLOU 8D JOULE +40 40
>Ryan_Fischer: EFLORVX 9C VOX +35 35
#note Perhaps FOX would've been better considering how closed things get.
>Joey_Krafchick: INT D8 ..INT +24 64
>Ryan_Fischer: EFILORS I2 FOILERS +75 110
#note Forgot to look through the T for the real word.  Oops.  Intentional somewhat infamous phony here.
>Joey_Krafchick: EGHN 4H H.NGE +26 90
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHIOPU J4 .OH +29 139
#note I think this is where my problems begin.  (N)OH is just okay, but I need to manage this drek better.  Problem is, there's really no good place to do it without giving a lot back.  
>Joey_Krafchick: ADEITUZ M4 DEUTZIA +80 170
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIPUV 8M .AP +42 181
>Joey_Krafchick: ABDRS 11I BRADS +34 204
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINQUV L9 QA.I +41 222
#note Aw.  Missed E3 EQUIN(OX) 46.  Damn.
>Joey_Krafchick: EW H1 WE +20 224
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINUV 12H VIE +16 238
#note AVENUE, VENUE, UVEA... I played VIE for all the wrong reasons.  Closing up things even more is so not the answer.  I thought this would force him to give me something back.  Not so much.
>Joey_Krafchick: MY 13J MY +12 236
#note Dammit, here it comes.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFLNUU J1 EF +30 268
#note I probably shouldn't have taken these points with this leave, staring down the barrel of an imminent bingo, but I didn't know what else to do here.  Help?
>Joey_Krafchick: ?ABDELT 13A BLAsTED +84 320
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AKLNUU 11B LU.K +16 284
#note F10 KUN(E) 18 statically.  I played LU(N)K to give myself a chance to win, clinch the tournament now, 'cause my spread was pretty good.  It just made things worse.  L(E)K was another less good option.  Or LEKU to leave no hook, create a third lane.
>Joey_Krafchick: ACGIM A7 MAGIC +41 361
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AINOOU A13 .OO +15 299
#note Dammit, of all the times to draw vowels.
>Joey_Krafchick: ADENORS O8 .ADRONES +86 447
#note ...
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIINTU B1 NAUTIlI +66 365
#note Missed mINUTIA.  Saw it after I played this.  Wasn't sure if it took an S.  Nope, just E and L.
>Joey_Krafchick: ACEPRT 15I CARPET. +14 461
>Ryan_Fischer: GORSTWY 1A S.OWY +45 410
#note Well, kudos to him for not letting me fish or make a setup.
>Joey_Krafchick: EEINNR D1 .INNER +18 479
#note Ooh, 15G RE(CARPETS) 39.  His play is at least apt.  Blocks my out, gives me another one.
