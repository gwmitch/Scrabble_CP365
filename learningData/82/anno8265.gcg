#note Had it at 3K first, then moved it over.  Cree exclaimed he would have had a near 200 pt play.  I thought he was joking.

#note Hilariously, Cree makes the 68 pt play, and gives me one last chance to x3x3 out for the win.

#note Turns out, there was AGIRUS in the bag after I played NIM.  I drew AR.  If I draw one of AI, UI, AS, IR, IS, (5/15 chance), and Cree makes the same play, I can x3x3 to win.  That would've been crazy.

#note -20. going over time, looking for a x3x3
