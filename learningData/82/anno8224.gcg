>Brett_Haughney: AZ J6 ZA. +33 33
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEIKU G8 .EUKEmIA +62 142
#note First time I've played this, but it's arguable that I misplayed it.  AGUELIKE is one point more, but it opens a hotspot, too.  Whether it's more or less dangerous is debatable.
>Brett_Haughney: GINW 15G .WING +27 60
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHIJTU 11E JU.E +30 172
#note Missed K2 THUJA 41.
>Brett_Haughney: EORU 12B EURO +17 77
>Ryan_Fischer: AAHINPT F1 APHANIT. +71 243
#note Again, hard to say, but I think F1 is safer.
>Brett_Haughney: ?CDEFHT 1C DET.CH +39 116
#note Told me his rack here, which he took a long time on.  I saw CH(A)FED for 54.  Second is FlETCH(E)D for 80.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEMNSY F14 MY +36 279
#note Best.  Second is the play I first saw, MAY for 32.
>Brett_Haughney: AELQ C10 EQ.AL +28 144
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELNOS K4 LOAD +24 303
#note I11 DO/I10 OD.  This is 3rd.  Blocks some lanes, which, I guess is ideal, but less fun.  Also opens a lane for me.
>Brett_Haughney: EFGNO B6 GONEF +34 178
>Ryan_Fischer: AENORSS A1 SENORAS +79 382
#note Crazy lucky.  I had it in two other places before this anyway.  His play only made mine worth 3 more points.  Still, unfair, especially for a game we were both looking forward to.
>Brett_Haughney: DOP L6 POD +26 204
>Ryan_Fischer: EILMSTY 3C MET.YL +36 418
#note C3 LIMEY 42, G3 MY 25.  Oops.  I saw (D)EMY (3rd).  Mine's 4th.
>Brett_Haughney: BIR 8L .RIB +21 225
>Ryan_Fischer: DIIORST 4C ID +16 434
#note I10 ID 20 creates an S hook and scores.  Passed on EDITOR.  It's nice to speed up the end of the game, but with 4 bingos, I wanted to see if I could find a 5th.
>Brett_Haughney: ?AIINRR O8 .RAINIeR +80 305
>Ryan_Fischer: IORSTTV 4I VO.TI +16 450
>Brett_Haughney: A L3 A. +2 307
>Ryan_Fischer: CORSTWX M1 TOX.C +46 496
#note More luck.  Oops, should have hooked the S to ZAPS, but I forgot TOXIC could take the S.  Before this, I could've dropped the X for 50, or played EX... something for at least 59 with the right draw.  Crazy.  If I hadn't played the I, I might have had (E)XCITOR there.  This play leaves ROWS to go out.  Didn't see anything else.
>Brett_Haughney: BEEOSTV 15A VEST +39 346
#note Champ says 2J VET(O)ES 37 to block my out.
>Ryan_Fischer: RSW 2L R.WS +17 513
#note We both would've liked a more even match to decide the tourney and the temp tiptop of NC.  But with 1800 on the line, I'll take it.
