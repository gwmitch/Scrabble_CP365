#note Absolutely no clue what to do here. I decided holding onto the case U was ok with the Q still out. Best is G3 VINO though that leaves three vowels. My play is a couple percentage points behind.

#note Just hope for a good draw I guess. Fortunately the majority of the bag is consonants. Best.

#note Tough position. I didn't see QUAERE/TWINE, though my opponent can underlap with DJINS/JINS/JINNS depending on his rack and still win. 
>opponent: ADGINNS 6H GNA. +7 393
#note Good play. If not there I can also play QAT/QI followed by UREA/UVEA, but I'll still lose by about the same amount.
