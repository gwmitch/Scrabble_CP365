#note Opponent changed two. Don't feel like giving him much to work with. VOLT, which I'd play normally, gives him a jillion hooks to play off of.

#note Not the most defensive bingo

#note CRITERIA or RETIARII 11D for 78
>scott_jackson: EEIJOUW 11E OU.E. +10 73
#note Collins would really help here. Best is F14 WO, I just didn't like keeping that many vowels.

>scott_jackson: ABEEITX I3 BI +26 144
#note I wanted to keep the X and hope I got an O for J9, though that's unlikely only drawing two. I didn't see AXE H13 41. My play isn't that great because it blocks off the K5 hotspot from a parallel play. 12B IBEX is prety good, probably because of the leave. 
>opponent: ACGIM K5 MAGIC +36 163
>scott_jackson: ADEENTX F5 EX +31 175
#note Same play at H13, or 8K INDEX. Keeping ADENT isn't that great when there's not many bingo lines. 
>opponent: AOUVZ 14B ZOUAV. +50 213
#note nice play

#note RIOTERS one down for 8 more.
>scott_jackson: EFKMNPR 2J FEM +35 287
#note I also considered 8A KEFS, but really wanted to take out this hotspot first. Best.
>opponent: BLOW C3 BLOW +25 302
#note 3C BLOW(JOB), haha!
>scott_jackson: KNPPQRY -KNPPQY +0 287
#note 7B PYIN 30 is tempting but this is just too ugly. Quackle likes it though. I didn't see it, and my exchange is apparenly horrible in comparison. There are two U's unseen so I assume that's a factor.

#note No reception for my SULFONE. 12A FONS is better.
>opponent: AHS H13 ASH +39 383
>scott_jackson: EGILSUY 10C G.Y +12 359
#note Didn't want to empty the bag or ditch the U. Third best, but the best play that keeps the U. 
>opponent: K 5B K.. +7 390
>scott_jackson: EILNQSU 2J ....S +24 383
#note I should have played EQUINES first, though it still loses. Also of note (TECH)NIQUES!

There is actually one (and only one) winning play - 10I ELS/MAGICS. But that's because if he blocks EQUINE with ED I can go out with (TECH)NIQUE. Fat chance I'd see that, especially since I only had a minute or two left on my clock. 
>opponent: DIPPTUY 12I .D +3 393
#note Opponent still wins if he lets me have EQUINE since he can then play PIETY N10
