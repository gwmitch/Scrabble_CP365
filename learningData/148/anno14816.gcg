#note this is a really bad position; i shouldn't be down nearly 50 this early when i had the blank on the opening rack. spend more time on the opening moves.

#note running low on time already. 10J ENVIED is cool. I11 TOGUE is kind of ridiculous - wtf? 1G EMU is very reasonable. i'm better off trying to block a possible bingo from him. XU pretty much sucks, i should have seen what tiles i could draw, but it doesn't hit very much. (-6)
