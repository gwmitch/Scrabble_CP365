#note Coincidentally, I started off the moning with a post about TWL rage, which occurs when the inability to play a CSW word proves costly. And right away, when I need it most, against Kenji, my chance to play ABOIDEAU is quashed because I cannot play UR.

HOWEVER, I do not feel rage. I cannot feel any rage against this sweet, sweet boy who has contributed so much to our beloved game.

No, what I feel is positve energy, a desire to manifest that energy into a sea change in the Scrabble scene, a flood of converts to CSW, that will obviate this issue. Rather than feeling bitter, I choose to send that energy out into the aether, in the hopes of convincing those timid little bitches that they should not fear Collins.

#note Kenji hasn't been doing well this tournament--he deserves the ess.
>Winter: ADFJLSU 6J JA.FUL +34 73
#note Allow me to feel some satisfaction in making a good play. Quackle likes FUJ(I), but I rather like my JARFUL of love and joy.

#note The old Winter would have lamented the loss of a 221-point triple-triple, and cursed Kenji for blocking it, but the new Winter has only love in his heart. I was not meant to play that triple-triple, and that's just how it is.

Of course, it would be nice if I could channel all this love that is in my heart into the bedroom of a beautiful young lass, but just as the new Winter is free of anger, he is also free of the possibility of ever getting laid again.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?AEINTW E9 WANIEsT +83 153
#note The old Winter would have bristled at seeing Kenji bingo after blocking TWO OF MINE, but I got nuthin' but love in my my heart, and I just sit back and admire the beauty of Kenji's play--this is, after all, why he is the second best player in WGPO.

#note If the right tiles chose to manifest themselves on Kenji's rack, it is because that is where they were meant to be, in the same way that if a woman is sexually assaulted and ends up pregnant, the baby should be carried to term, because it is the will of God (or so say many a Republican).
>Winter: EEEELNT F10 TEE +22 174
#note Another player might grumble at four Es, but I see this as an opportunity to make the right play. Not sure why Quackle likes NEE or TEE though, given that open G + 5 Is in the bag.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AARZ O6 .AZAR +42 230
#note Hey, one way to look at this is that Kenji just scored 42 points, after 35, after 83. But another way is that he DIDN'T play (L)AZARETS. See, it's all about perspective. Sure, that cute woman at the cafe won't even look at you (why would she, when you look like a dogshit-faced troll), but on the other hand you have more time to be productive.
>Winter: CCEEELN L10 CEE +23 197
#note My first serious mistake of the game.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: LNOR N9 LORN +12 242
#note Kenji let out a soft sigh, not quite a whimper, as he played this, and I genuinely felt sorry for the lad. He deserves better.
>Winter: CEELNRU H2 CERULE.N +61 258
#note I was 99% sure of LUCERNE, for eight more points, but given my 1% uncertainty, and the fact that it would give up a bunch of points, I went with the safe play.

Not reaching beyond one's station--that's another important part of winning at Scrabble, and at life. If you don't ask for anything, you cannot be rejected.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EITX O12 EXIT +39 281
#note No Exit (French: Huis Clos) is a 1944 existentialist French play by Jean-Paul Sartre. The original title is the French equivalent of the legal term in camera, referring to a private discussion behind closed doors; English translations have also been performed under the titles In Camera, No Way Out, Vicious Circle, Behind Closed Doors, and Dead End. The play was first performed at the Théâtre du Vieux-Colombier in May 1944.[1]
It is a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for eternity, and is the source of one of Sartre's most famous and most often misinterpreted quotations, l'enfer, c'est les autres ("Hell is other people"), a reference to Sartre's ideas about the Look, and the constant ontological struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object in the world of another consciousness.[2]
>Winter: AIKOOPT K3 KAP. +31 289
#note I agonzied over this play. With no As left, I was loathe to give mine up, but I just couldn't find anything good.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: BEN G3 BEN +19 300
#note Did you know that Martin Sheen's Uncle Ben is returning in "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" (presumably in flashback). Along with "Captain America: The Winter Soldier", "X-Men: Days of Future Past", and "Guardians of the Galaxy"), 2014 is looking to be a spectacular year for comic book films, and in light of that, does it really matter that Kenji has the lead?
>Winter: IIOOPTU G7 P.I +22 311
#note Interesting. Did not see POUTI(ER), but perhaps the reason is that the new Winter doesn't pout like the old one. The new Winter looks around and sees the beauty of the world, as symbolized by the Greek letter PHI.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: GMNO 4C MONG.. +18 318
#note Enjoy the game for the beauty of the language! Words like MONGER, for example, used in "Hamlet" (FISHMONGER, actually), or WHOREMONGER, which hits close to home. Kenji, are you trying to tell me something, ask me for advice perhaps?

Call me anytime, bro. I'll hook you up.
>Winter: ?IOOSTU 3C UT +14 325
#note This is funny, that I miss VOMITOUS, because my face is VOMITOUS to women.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: MO 5D MO +17 335
#note I sense the tide shifting Kenji's way, despite my blank, but my heart is at peace.
>Winter: ?IIOOSY 6D SOY +23 348
#note Hmm... I saw (Q)I, which would have blocked Kenji's play. This is where I lost it. Luck had nothing to do with it, and that's the lesson here.

Also, bacon tastes yummy but is ethically questionable.

>Winter: ?GIIO 2A IgG +12 360
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DOT B12 DOT. +10 366
#note Ah, well--I can at least say I played my part, in getting Kenji back on the road towards winning all of the Reno events.
