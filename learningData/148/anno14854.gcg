#note i was feeling lazy with this rack but then maddy started looking for a tally slip so i realized she had a blank and then i started furiously thinking of 8s until i thought of parboils then i willed her into playing an I in her bingo. again, those few seconds of agony are unnecessary; the use of a blank should not be made obvious until it is on the board (or even afterwards; i like covering up the blank with my hand as i lay down the word to make myself seem less lucky).

#note i strongly regretted this move afterwards. *NOW* is the right time to play NURD/DURN at H11; the leave is the same but i need the luck and she's not that likely to have an S; but again i don't know how to make that calculation in my head. it still sims really close by valuation but farther away by win%.

#note and now my bingo doesn't fit but she's more likely to have an S. i'm not totally sure wtf i was doing not playing NIP. i think i didn't like that there were 3 Ts out and only 1 N and i thought i'd give myself the best chance to bingo, but that's dumb because there are still a bunch of tiles in the bag an ERST > ERNS. big error.

#note a good way for me to tell when i've screwed up a game is when i'm down and have had a couple of homeless bingos in a row. quackle here starts doing the wrong thing like C1 NEVOID or C3 VOID, D1 DOVEN, etc etc, I can't play there, i need a new lane. maybe a better way to open a new lane is to play AVO and hope i get lucky though; OVEN just gives up too much.
