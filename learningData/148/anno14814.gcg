#note JIG has better defense, values more.  But static says EIST is better than AEST.

#note austerer is safer.  I played this too quickly, thinking AUSTERER didn't hit the x2x2.

#note I saw CLIFT, but for some reason thought I needed to draw an I for the setup to work.  I have 2 I's, dummy.  It's definitely best.  Also wasn't sure on FINICAL.

#note I wanted to block the 13-15 lines, but really didn't like the way this set up good hotspots.  Sim likes plays like COMI(C) and MICRO 9c.  Shrug.  I'm up a bingo; defense is the way to go here.
>E_Tran: ENT 15B TEN +18 255
>Siri_T: DEGIMNR 13G M.D +23 326
#note He's just made an obvious fishing play.  M(I)D keeps the board closed, forcing a LE bingo.  MIG allows LO and LA bingoes.  Sim really likes MINGIER.  I thought I was better off forcing him to bingo at N, where I can counter to the x3.  MINGIER, on the other hand, gives him one chance to bingo.  If he does, it's tied and I have a tempo.  If he doesn't, I have more spread, a hotspot, and a good shot at completely shutting down the board, including the N line, next turn.  I think they're close.
>E_Tran: EORZ 9D ZERO +24 279
>Siri_T: EGINNRV L3 ...ING +13 339
#note Sim likes HAVEN.  NEVI/ZINEB is crazy.  I really like WADING here.  I can bait Siri into play at 8L "to open the board" in which case I play at N to close the board and seal a victory.  Downside is that bingos starting at O score more and are defensive.  I stand by WADING.
