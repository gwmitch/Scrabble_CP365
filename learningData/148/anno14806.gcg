>Evans: BEGLRRW E6 BR.WLER +24 106
>JD: ABINNRT D11 BAIRN +24 47
#note JD: quackle likes BAN at D11 to avoid giving up cheap points but retain my bingo lanes, I think I agree
>Evans: ADGKSUY 14B DA.KY +42 148
#note EC: Quackle likes GAUDY F2 a little better, but at this score, I prefer DARKY for its blockiness.
>JD: AAFHNNT B6 FA.TH +27 74
#note JD: tough call, FAITH and HAFT both block up good lanes. ultimately it seemed like I couldn't afford to clog the right side, and FAITH does create a hard-to-hit but high-scoring lane on A
>Evans: ?EGMSUZ J6 ZEUGMaS +101 249
>JD: AEILNNT K5 NA +15 89
#note JD: I was pretty stumped here...gotta draw the game out if I want any chance whatsoever of winning. maybe just fish the N and shoot for column A?
>Evans: AAEORTX L4 TAXA +43 292
>JD: EEILMNT 11G MEL.NITE +68 157
>Evans: ELOOORR M9 RE.OOL +14 306
#note JD: not sure I get this play, maybe he already had an S?
#note EC: Naw, I just had a bunch of O's and R's I needed to get rid of. I missed BOOR 6E, though. That looks better.
>JD: EHNOPQS O7 QOPHS +67 224
#note JD: now even though I used my S I still have a beautiful S hook lane
>Evans: IIJOORT 15A JOI. +38 344
>JD: CEFINUY F2 UNIFY +36 260
>Evans: GIOPRRT H10 R.PORT +33 377
>JD: ACDEEEL 9E .EE +17 277
#note JD: I saw RECALLED if I feel like taking the points and conceding the game, but it seemed worth prolonging the game one last time to see if I could hit column A.
>Evans: EGIINOO A1 NOOGIE +32 409
#note JD: evans did a great job of turning over tiles and shorting the game. with a big lead you want the game to be over as fast as possible.
>JD: ACDELOU D1 CEDULA +32 309
#note JD: pretty clear that I'm toast, just trying to block bingoes he might have. sims miles ahead on valuation.
>Evans: ?AEISST 15G S.AIdEST +65 474
#note JD: artistes for 5 more
#note EC: SATIRE words are hard.
>Evans:  (CEGIOUV) +26 500
