#note It sims about even with LATEN with no knowledge, but if I specify a bingo-ey leave for Jeremy like RSEI, LATEN sims well ahead. I guess because I should block the 2x2?

#note I had no clue what to do here. Neither does Quackle, it seems. This sims close with 6F COOL and 4K DOULA and other plays.

#note Nah, the S is worth a bit more than that. ROQUE sims a few points better.

#note I was kind of hoping he'd be unsure of ABOVES, but in any case this is the play.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEGMMNY F11 EMMY +21 342
#note So I was about 80% sure of GEMMY. I convinced myself that I could easily be confusing it with GEMMA/GUMMY/JEMMY. But in any case, I decided to play as blocky as possibly rather than trying to outrun with D1 GEMMY (a word that I wasn't positive of). The issue with EMMY is that it would possibly lose to a huge play hooking the S. I think the sim is a bit hard on it, but odds are that Jeremy is all 1-pointers afte ZA, so I'm unlikely to get smoked by JOINTS or FOGIES or something. And odds are he has the blank here. So I'm not sure this play is as bad as Quackle thinks. I think it's fine.

#note So Jeremy did show me the blank on that last play, so that's no longer in question. The point of this play was to race to the end of the bag, and kill the EMMYS spot in case he drew a J word there. I think it's the right idea, but I missed the better way to do it: D9 LOIDING. Much better.
