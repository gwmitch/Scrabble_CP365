#note Randall wanted to ditch an extra vowel here.  In post mortem, we thought HARK might be better, to be defensive and set up the X.  Quack finds HE(D)ER 4H here.

#note I'm behind, but have good letters compared to the pool. Thought it would be hard for him to hit the x3.  With this line, I might even be able to win without bingoing. KUFIS feels like giving up.  FEU has a good leave, but nowhere to bingo.  2ply comes up with 5A IF, for defense and a good leave.

#note Moment of truth.  He's gonna block O3 next turn, so I need to set up a 2nd threat.  (Quackle doesn't think Randall will always block O3, so it's dumb).  Other thoughts were (T)UT, (T)IT, (G)UT, and (T)UTTI.  with so many I's in the bag, and the case E, I decided on GIT.  TUTTI makes it too difficult to bingo, and I'm not convinced a bit score there will be enough
