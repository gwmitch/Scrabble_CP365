#note 3K GOTH seems a little nutty, also a better board fork than that would be helpful if I get closer to bingoing.

>Will: ?AEGJPT 3K J.G +22 198
#note Okay, I know what I just said about board forking and JOG is horrible in that regard, but JAPE isn't great positionally either and AEPT? is easily the strongest leave I can get here.

#note Missed 5H PETARD, first off. Secondly playing off a vowel here is a BIG, potentially game losing mistake. Need to play APT here for sure. 12C POH doesn't do much for me but it still must be better than ABA.

>Will: ?DEFLPT 4E PELF +18 231
#note I really brought this on myself by playing my vowels too readily. I missed BUCKLED here too, which is actually quite reasonable at this point since I can expect a play at O11 every time he has one, and after that my bingo chances are down the tubes anyway. After BUCKLED I still have the blank and a couple good scoring tiles. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that had I played POH on the previous turn, even clunky picks like the F and K would give me bingos here (BEDFAST, BATIKED).

#note And now I fail to appreciate 3B NUTS/TUNS as options that are legitimately hard to block completely, especially if Jason doesn't have an N to play atop them with NU.

>Will: ?CEENSS M12 SECS +29 295
#note Went over a few minutes looking for crazy fits on row 3 and OVATION extensions (surprisingly few words beyond the obvious). This game was a mess, hopefully I can learn from mistakes like ABA and PELF.
