#note I was pretty annoyed after the last couple turns and made a play I knew was lousy. Though I'm not sure I would have settled on Quackle's choices: C13 GUN/GNU. This is probably not bad, except obviously do SIGN instead so I can bingo through the N.

#note I'm inferring from ZA that the blank is still in the bag, otherwise he likely would have burned it to score 60+ there.

#note Ugh. The play I really wanted to make is simming best: ex 7. So why didn't I do it? I dunno, I felt pressured to get some points this turn. Playing is fine, too, but obviously just do LOUIS instead.

#note Plays I considered with this, N12 YOU, 13L YOUR, A1 ODYL, and C13 YOU. I decided to hedge my bets and give myself a shot at outrunning or bingoing out. At the very least, it makes this tricky for David. It sims 2% worse than M3 GUY. I dunno if I like putting all my eggs in one basket by scoring so little there, especially since it will make David more likely to play blocky. But maybe my odds with winning without bingoing after YO are worse than I think.
