#note i gotta stop missing CWMS. i just saw CWM but no spot for it. if CWM wasn't a word that would make 11D AX less appetizing too. (-13)

#note a faint worry started creeping up on me here.
>cesar: CEFGIMZ L13 FEZ +32 340
#note this was a super tough move for me. i was mostly debating between L10 FEM, the sim winner and runaway obvious play, L13 FEZ, the scared play, and N13 FEZ, the slightly less scared but not really play. 12B ZIG/FIG are also good. i guess there's not much to say here other than i overvalued that spot. the potential points i give up with L13 FEZ don't matter at all since quackle says defensively he will score about the same with either play (L13 or L10). N13 FEZ scores more now but it gives up a lot more. i should have definitely played L10 FEM. (-8)

#note eek.
>cesar: ACGIMTU 12B MUG +20 360
#note here i basicaly vomited all over the board and deserve to be demoted back to sub-STEE land. honestly i don't completely understand why i make plays like these. i know they're wrong when i'm doing them but i have a thrill seeking nature that i can't get rid off that peeks its head out randomly during important games. i missed UMIAQ and quackle has nothing in the B column, but it's going to be quite tough for him to win if i block the only bingo lane (rather than create a good one!). N5 SMUG is a good play too, but i think i should have made something to block column B even though it sims poorly. maybe it could have waited a turn if i'd played UMIAQ or SMUG. quackle doesn't think i made that huge of a mistake though. i didn't play GUM because of NOME/NOMA but whatever. (-3)

#note this is, of course, phony; in case you didn't know, i know no words in the dictionary. but since few people see these games anyway they won't know any better. haha! a good player at the tournament told me i had "stronger word knowledge than him" -- i don't think so.
>cesar: AACIOTV 7F AVA +27 387
#note i think quackle is right. VETO H12 even though it keeps AACI opens another (very weak) bingo lane, scores quite a bit to the point where he may not want to sacrifice points to block the B column (and if he does i may be able to outscore). i didn't want to play it because then he'd block the only viable bingo lane and i thought i needed to bingo to win, and maybe if i don't play it he'll try to score there and open a bingo lane for me. (-5)

#note quackle is 100% wrong here; it wants to play 14A IN/ON to presumably score a lot with the I next turn -- that's still not going to win the game! many ply sim doesn't work right here.

>cesar: ACEINTT 15A NICTATE. +86 483
#note whew.. luckily i drew it in both places. i might have had a harder time winning if he didn't empty the bag and blocked the bottom lane but i think i'll still win most games with this rack. Kevin said he should have never given me the D in VELD to begin with, i think he had a slightly lower scoring play that put a worse letter there.
