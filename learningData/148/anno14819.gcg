>Kristiina_Overton: EOPRV 8D PROVE +26 26
#note Ottawa matchplay best 3 of 5. Game 2
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AEIINR H1 INERtIA. +74 74
>Kristiina_Overton: AEGINTT E7 T.EATING +68 94
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEEGINO F10 BO +22 96
#note Not usually happy to keep two vowels with an ING leave, but this bingos or hits 2x2s a lot.
>Kristiina_Overton: JU 2F JU. +26 120
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEEGINS 4E ENE.GIDS +70 166
#note I dunno, you might prefer one of the riskier bingos.
>Kristiina_Overton: KLLR 6F KR.LL +21 141
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIOSTVY 13C SY.OVIA +36 202
#note Thought it would be pretty close with 3C IVY. And it is, but I think this is right.
>Kristiina_Overton: ?CZ H12 Z.nC +72 213
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEGHNTW 5B WHET +24 226
#note Damn, I missed 14B THEGN. That's a tough one to spot.
>Kristiina_Overton: ADFT 3B DAFT +19 232
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DGHIMNY 12D M. +22 248
#note I'm already down to 8 minutes here and Kristiina is speeding up. So I kind of just tossed this down to give me a minute to think. It's actually not bad. I6 LINGY is probably better. I'm kind of assuming she's going to hit me with a Z play.

#note That was lucky

>Kristiina_Overton: CLO O9 COL +24 316
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADGOOST 15L DOST +31 362
#note Hmm... this sims badly. Does Quackle want me to bank it and hope for a bigger score next turn? That feels a little greedy. It felt like she'd have a really hard time catching up after I go ahead by 46 here. 6A GOOD is the sim winner. I dunno...

#note Ugh. I'm under 2 minutes and panic here. I thought this gave nothing back, but it just loses to NEWEST. Damn. I thought keeping NICOL would be plenty for me to outrace whatever she has. This best play is UNICOLOR. Second best is 3J or 3K AI. Seems odd.
