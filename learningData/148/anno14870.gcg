>Rafi: BEGHHNY 7H GYBE +26 26
#note 9H EH threatening WHY for 29 setting up by B is an interesting sequence, and sims best. Thought about BY also, but I don't think I'm going to be in great shape with EGHHN.

>Kenji: AIJO D1 JIAO +49 155
>Rafi: AGPPRSX L4 PAX +44 172
#note PAX is much better than SPRAG, because I set up my G and P for ZA overlaps, blus my S for a play on the triple with ZEES.

>Rafi: ADDNQSU C13 QUA +51 289
#note Maybe QUADS or QUAD? I don't think I can give up a 40 point QI play but I might need to take the risk to leave open the bingo lines. However, after QUA I still have the S for some big plays hooking ZAG.
>Kenji: AEILUV 10J ELUVIA +19 339
>Rafi: DDEMNOS 11J DOM +26 315
#note DOM sets up the chance for something like DRIVELS or CRAVENS, and also leaves good bingo tiles (on a dying board however). I thought it made sense to get within striking distance so that I might have a shot without a bingo, but I still can threaten one. MODS is another good option, but it gives a pretty good comeback and wastes my S. I have a decent shot at WINDIEST off the W, and maybe something through E_I. 
>Kenji: KLOO A1 LOOK +53 392
>Rafi: CDEILNS 15A CL.. +21 336
#note Looked for fishes for a bingo through AG... I actually could fish for DIAGNOSE but there's only one O unseen and fishing two tiles for ten points makes it pretty apparent what I'm doing. I don't think ALCIDS is going to work either... it's too easy to shut down. After CLAG I have another shot at WINDIEST, or a lucky bingo through E_I again. (Another option is the phoney SELENIDIC, which I considered but thought was too ridiculous to have any chance to be good.) After some further analysis, ALCIDS might actually have a shot. I have an outside shot to draw into DRAGONET, DRAGLINE, DIAGONAL, UNAGREED, or LAAGERED. If I draw ADR, I might be able to open up the top and have one final fish at a triple-triple.

>Kenji: AAIILTU 14B A..TY +36 449
>Rafi: DDEINSW 11C D.W +14 380
#note According to Quackle, I can fish the D and win sometimes if I draw the N for ENWINDS, but there aren't any racks that Kenji wouldn't be able to block with. Even without the A, TRY works as a block, and there aren't any racks I could have from Kenji's perspective that don't bingo.
