>Bnjy: AFFIILN 8D FINAL +24 24
#note B: I was only like 95% on finial at the time and overlooked the e hook on final. If i saw it i would've played finial.
>Will: EGGINST G7 N.GGIEST +64 64
>Bnjy: CEEFIOW D7 O.FICE +28 52
>Will: EEGIITW I6 GIE +14 78
#note W: I suppose I need to bite the bullet and play TWICE here.
>Bnjy: CDEOUVW C3 VOWED +33 85
>Will: EEIORTW B5 OW +31 109
#note W: Missed the safer E5 TOWIE. Very nearly played the much safer 13C WRIES. The board isn't quite bingo friendly enough to try OW at this juncture.
>Bnjy: ?ABCLUY 11D .UB.CALlY +118 203
#note RAWR
>Will: ADEEIRT 13G .TEADIER +70 179
#note W: SICK play Benjy, one of the best I have ever seen. Would have played SERIATED had I known STEADIER s-hooked.
>Bnjy: AAILORV A5 VARIOLA +95 298
#note B: scored as 98... missed ovarial for 3 more
>Will: AEOPSXY C12 POXY +36 215
#note Intentionally playing in a super-volatile way here
>Bnjy: ABEIMPU B11 MABE +47 345
>Will: ?AEKRSS 2A ShAKERS +87 302
#note B: scored as 90... i guess we're even. W: Obviously dismissed STEADIERS, I could also play A13 ASK but I can't be passing up 50 at this score.
>Bnjy: INOPQUU E2 .QUIP +32 377
#note B: aaah crap. I even considered upo/upon, and quackle likes it a bit better than this. I figured that those plays might lead to some disaster scenarios and that this would be safer.
>Will: ADJLOTZ 1G ADZ +41 343
#note Yuck, how could I miss A13?
>Bnjy: DINORTU J2 DURION +20 397

>Bnjy: EEHHNOT 14I THEN +35 432
>Will: AINORTT L2 T.NTORIA +68 451
>Bnjy: EEHNOTU A14 HE +28 460
#note B: not gonna lie... this game was pretty tilting
>Will: MS 10C S.M +9 460
#note W: Pretty miraculous second half.
>Will:  (ENOTU) +10 470
