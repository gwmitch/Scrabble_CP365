#note im not gonna play KIP after RUE. well, it doesn't necessarily imply the S, i know, i just don't feel like it; DIP is almost as many points without being as dangerous. (-3)
>judy: II -II +0 60
>cesar: AHKLSTW 10E WHAT +24 129
#note i made a pretty big mistake here. i was too focused on keeping the K for 3C, especially since i thought i needed to keep scoring after her last couple of plays, that i completely missed 4F HAWK. blah, why do i suck. (-5.5)

>cesar: ADEKLQS 3A DAK +39 168
#note woohoo, i scored.
>judy: ?ACMRST K2 CR.MATeS +72 206
#note nope
>cesar: EELLQSX G3 Q. +21 189
#note i blame this on the fact that i'm directing the tournament too. nothing to see here. (-22.5)
>judy: EZ J4 .EZ +67 273
>cesar: EELLSXY 2I LY.EES +38 227
#note i am pretty terrible but this time at least it's closer. (-12.5)
>judy: AMN 1H NAM +24 297
>cesar: BLOSTUX 8K .XULT +57 284
#note wrong again, flanders. i'm pretty sure the right move here is 1L BOUT and hold the X for another turn. quackle has EXULT as a 3 point favorite though. maybe i did the math right in my head. ::shrug::

#note don't have my whole rack. let's assume i didn't miss a bingo
>judy: ENO 12C ONE +20 367
>cesar: AFIOORS 2A OF +27 331
#note pretty close here to FOLIO, i wonder what's better. maybe i need to go for the blank.
>judy: ?AEENOU O6 OU.EAtEN +58 425
>cesar: AEIORSU N10 AUREI +23 354
#note i'm out of ideas now. i'm pretty sure it's not right to burn all my bingo tiles, block several lanes, and use up 5 tiles thus bringing the end of the game closer, though. 12K OURIE sims best; better leave and it opens up a lane. QI is worth thinking about, but i didn't like how it doesn't work with anything. (-1%)
>judy: BEY M11 BEY +35 460
#note oh right, and it allows a high scoring comeback
>cesar: CIIORST 13E SORITIC +68 422
>judy: AEGLNRS H12 G.RL +21 481
#note judy saw LING after hitting her clock for a nice 3K outplay
>cesar: II 3G .I +13 435
>judy: AENS B12 SANE +12 493
#note even though i feel like i played this game very badly, adding up the equity losses it's about 45 pts. that's below my average equity loss per game for NSC 08 and 09 and above a lot of recent games. hopefully i'm getting better and will do well this year!
