#note I knew if I drew the Z I would be stuck after this play, but if UP can be construed as a sign that Aldo did not have the Z last turn, then there's a 1/3 chance of drawing it and I need to not make a play that sticks me all of those times. I thought if I drew the N or the O that there would be no ZONE play available down there, but there's still AZOTE if the N is left, so that logic is flawed too. CP comes up with I12 CUE, which it claims wins 68% and a full 30 percent more than the next best option of 14M EAU, but playing out the endgame sequences suggests that number is quite a bit too high and that I am in trouble after most plays here. URAEI was among the worst things I could do here, though.
