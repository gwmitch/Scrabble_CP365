#note Against Gibson I feel that I should not make this play, as it really restricts the upper left quadrant. AKEE is a good alternative that I missed.

#note Liked this more than (ZA)IRE, as I don't see EITY going much of anywhere on that board
>David_Gibson: ADO 11C ADO +20 155
>Kevin_Bowerman: EHIRSTU 12D HEIR +31 107
#note Can't really do a one tile fish here. I think I like (ZA)IRE most because it sets up another lane and a large scoring spot which I am likely to be able to capitalize on
>David_Gibson: GMSU H12 SMUG +33 188
>Kevin_Bowerman: IIOPSTU I13 UPO +18 125
#note Hate blocking these lanes, but there really isn't much else to do. (D)UI sets up a new lane, but also blocks my best one.

>Kevin_Bowerman: IIOSSTT 6J S.IT +23 148
>David_Gibson: ABDEERU M3 BRU.ED +20 223
#note Said this was his leave here, and he wasn't sure on this play. I like it, it makes it very difficult for me to bingo
>Kevin_Bowerman: AIOOOST J13 TOO +21 169
>David_Gibson: ?ADEENT N6 sTANDEE +70 293
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEILOST O7 ALOES +37 206
#note Tacking on the S for 5 extra points, to turn over another tile, and to block the other huge scoring spot here. Gotta hope to open up later here I think.
>David_Gibson: RUY 11I RYU +23 316
>Kevin_Bowerman: FGIORTV M11 FOG +22 228
#note Should probably just play the R as well, but wanted to save it for a potential R(YA) opening, although that's probably not worth it
>David_Gibson: J 12L J.. +20 336
>Kevin_Bowerman: ILNRRTV -ILNRTV +0 228
#note I need the blank, thus change 6.
>David_Gibson: I H6 I... +8 344
>Kevin_Bowerman: BEFIOOR B11 FORB +26 254
#note Happy to see this is champ's top play, not gonna win this game by playing FOO
>David_Gibson: AX A14 AX +31 375
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AEIILO C7 ALI.. +10 264
#note Need to set up a difficult to block lane, and this is the best way of doing that
>David_Gibson: GIIMNRT D1 MITRING +79 454
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EEILOV 4A OvE.LIVE +62 326
#note Not many mistakes this game, CAKE probably should have been AKEE, and although not a traditional mistake could have changed things a lot against a very defensive player.
