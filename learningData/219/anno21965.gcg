#note Going into this final game, the tournament standings are, roughly:

Me 5-2 + 290
Joe 5-2 + 200
Diane 5-2 + 160
Joel 4-3 + 110

Diane and Joel are also playing. So if I win the game, I win the tournament unless Diane blows Joel out. Joe needs to win and have Joel win or Diane win by 40 less than himself, and Diane ideally wants Joe to win by about 45, in which case she can win by 90 or so and win the tournament.

#note LWEI looks better. I think I got too fixated on blocking the M column for some reason. -5

#note Joe's last play suggests he will likely bingo next turn, and being only up 30 with few scoring tiles left my best bet seems to be counterbingoing rather than outrunning, hence this play.

#note Oops. I missed his out of D1 YUAN. E3 AA is thus best. It turns out he missed YUAN too so it didn't end up costing me any spread though.
