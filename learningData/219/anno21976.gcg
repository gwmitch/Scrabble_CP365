>Winter: BEIMNNS 8D BINMEN +26 26
#note Wasn't sure if this was correct--perhaps a shorter BIN leavins MENS? In the end I decided that turover, trying to beat Carl to the blanks, favours me.

I'll never be as good as Carl, so I have to try and get lucky.
>Carl_Johnson: AOUVZ H3 ZOUAV. +19 19
>Winter: AEELRSS E4 REAL.SES +82 108
#note Dammit, underscored by 4.
>Carl_Johnson: OW F6 WO. +29 48
>Winter: ?AEEFGQ 5G Q.A +12 120
#note This rack frustrated me.
>Carl_Johnson: ?ILORRU 10B ULt.RIOR +61 109
>Winter: ?EEEFGI D2 FEE +16 136
#note So did this one. I hated to give up the points, but I could just smell Carl's coming back with the S if I hooked (QUA)G or the L if I hooked (QUA)I.
>Carl_Johnson: KR 5G ...RK +36 145
#note I knew it. If I didn't take it, he would!
>Winter: ?ADEGIO B4 DIAlOG.E +61 197
#note But at least I got the bingo.
>Carl_Johnson: AAHY A5 AYAH +53 198
#note Ugh.
>Winter: AABCETU A11 ACUTE +32 229
>Carl_Johnson: OPX B13 POX +41 239
>Winter: ABEFHPS C1 FEH +33 262
#note I considered HEAPS, but it seemed like it gave up too much. With only one ess left, if Carl doesn't have it, his chances to score are limited.
>Carl_Johnson: GI 1A GI. +21 260
>Winter: ABPRSTV L2 VATS +33 295
#note Did not want to risk giving up a counterplay for more points.
>Carl_Johnson: ADEENTT 7H .ENDETTA +67 327
#note AARRGHH!!
>Winter: BIINPRW O3 INWR.P +36 331
#note I still have a shot--tied score.
>Carl_Johnson: CEOY 2J CO.EY +38 365
#note Ouch.
>Winter: BDEINOT 1M BOD +27 358
#note I debated OBI, to minimise his chances of coming back, but then I decided that with a few open lines, I needed to keep EINT, despite all the Is in the bag, and hope for a bingo.
>Carl_Johnson: IJN F2 JIN +29 394

#note Yes!!!
