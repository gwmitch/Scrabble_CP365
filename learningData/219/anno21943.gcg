>Winter: AACEGNU K7 .NCAGE +18 109
#note This rack flustered me, and I finally decided that tightening up the board was worth the AU leave.

>Winter: ?EEIJLT 3I JILTE. +44 331
#note AARRGHH!!! I was so thrilled to score 44 and keep the blank that I didn't even look for a bingo!!!

Quackle only dings it 1 equity point, though.
>Wayne_Kelly: Q 14D Q.. +12 333
>Winter: ?CEEHLU 12K .H +20 351
#note Primarily blocking a parallel play hooking (ZA), like GAM(A) or (G)ETA.
>Wayne_Kelly: ANORY 4F RAYON +23 356
#note Ouch.
>Winter: ?CEEGLU E4 CLUE +23 374
#note Ugh, I suck. I know I've anagrammed ECLOGUE, but probably just twice, so I doubt I could have had the confidence to play it even if I see it.

At least I made the correct non-bingo play, CLUE instead of CLEG, which scores more but leaves me in danger of too many wowels.

Interestingly, Quackle gives CLUE the highest win %.
>Wayne_Kelly: MNORS 5G MORNS +36 392
>Winter: ?EFGIRS 6D F.SE +14 388
#note I used up almost all my time thinking about how to block his OBOE out play AND score a combined 39 points, before I noticed the Q hook.

Then I spent a ton more time before I found the winning combo.
