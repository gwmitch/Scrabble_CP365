#note Static likes QUBIT by 4 points, sim has this and QUBIT pretty close after 1000 iterations
>Avery: CEENORT L11 CONE. +16 119
#note I guess I see the value in CONED in retrospect. I was pretty tired after a long day of school while playing this game and I'm tired while annotating it 5 minutes after the game. I didn't mind flipping over one more tile, though it might be worth passing it up. I also didn't want to get stuck with a ton of consonants on a board that was quickly becoming unfriendly.

#note Passing up MAUDLIN it seems. LIMN sims better than MAUDLIN but this sims further down and then comes back up the longer the sim runs.
>Avery: EEIORRT 4D RE.O +10 160
#note Played this way too fast. RIOTED seems to be a bit better, but this cost me.

#note I rightly passed up DELOUSING
>Nyx: GILMNNX H1 MINX +84 307
#note I didn't even think of this when I played REDO. Bad bad move.

>Avery: AEFHRSS B6 HAS +31 443
#note 3 other plays in this spot win. HES, SAFER, and HERS. SAFER is a tough sequence since I have to find 5D SHA and HERS requires K7 FAS. Thankfully I found this!
