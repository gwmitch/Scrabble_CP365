#note he said he kept an F. BONZE looks fine.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AEJSVW 6D VAW +41 69
#note I felt the J was worth keeping to score, but now I realize ESV? is waaaay more bingo prone.

#note AUTOCAR looks like the play. I considered CIAO and OU, and saw CHOU but wasn't sure of it. ACIRT isn't great to begin with and isn't helped by the UOIA on the board, but the E could do good things. I should probably have played for points here. I think I fished too much this tournament. Volatility isn't bad cause I felt like the underdog in almost all my games, but not crazy amounts.

>Jackson_Smylie: AAEIINO -AIIO +0 258
#note I didn't see any play I liked. AIDA or AIA above radicant seem fine, especially to keep the E hook for radicant. I wasn't sure of ERADICANT but I was willing to play it if necessary. Especially with the few vowels left AIDA is fine.

#note not DEX cause i want to bingo soon and also keep 13a open for opening a new lane.
>Marty_Gabriel: ADGR 1H GRAD +24 373
>Jackson_Smylie: DEIMNPU 13A DUP +31 328
#note tough call between dup and dupe... I figure 31 + bingo gets me close, and with only EE out EIMN looks a lot better. I need to get lucky no matter what.
