#note I'm not sure what's right. I should probably trust Q speedy which says MNORS is best by 1.6, but that seems so counterintuitive. I considered MORS for scoring options.
>Geoff_Thevenot: BCDEMNO -B +0 0
>Jackson_Smylie: EINORST H3 STONIER +66 66
#note Not sure if I pass or what... if he passed back I would assume he has 6 points and then play stonier, but maybe this rack does better at turn 2. Playing stonier is probably right.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AGINORZ 8A ORGANIZ. +107 107
>Jackson_Smylie: BCDINRW D4 WIND.C +24 90
#note I saw COWBIRD but wasn't sure of it... COWBIND and BAWDRIC are also awesome words. This rack is filled with unique possibilities.

>Geoff_Thevenot: EFT 3K TEF +32 209
>Jackson_Smylie: DMORSWY B6 WO.MY +29 155
#note BYWORDS is awesome. I was dangerously close to trying D(R)YWORMS* for 100.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ALX C3 LAX +34 243
>Jackson_Smylie: DEHRSUU J6 .URUSH +20 175
#note I slapped this down too quickly, HUI or DUH are better. B1 HUED as well.

>Jackson_Smylie: DDEEEES 11I E.ED +16 191
#note Maybe SEEN to score.

>Jackson_Smylie: AHIJLMT 2J JAM +36 301
#note Tough call here... I really wanted to keep the H to open the board and score, but it's hard to bingo ending in H unless I have ISH, and the CU pattern doesn't work well for scoring with *H? pattern, has to end in H basically. HAJ is good cause I still have the M for the a10 spot, but idk. HAJ is probably right I'm just not sure.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ABP B2 BAP +24 362
>Jackson_Smylie: AEHILRT G2 HI. +10 311
#note RAH or LAH seem nice to open a big. I don't know how to win, HIN is to go for FOOTGEAR and other G plays if he blocks thin.
>Geoff_Thevenot: GO F1 GO +12 374

#note Great way to end CanAm. It was one of my favourite tournaments ever, tons of fun to play such high level opponents. My word knowledge gave me a lot of problems this tournament, as did my board vision.
