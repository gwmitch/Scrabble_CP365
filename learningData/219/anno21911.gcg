#note I didn't consider forgoing the bingo to block the row 15 3*3 at all, but given the score that may very well be correct. I can bingo with HERNIATE to put another tile in the 3*3 lane, but an E in the 7th spot doesn't really make it that much harder for him to 3*3, and it may even help him in some cases where he doesn't have an E of his own. I can also not bingo by playing BEAN. If I play BEAN, I'm up 190 points with a strong EIRT leave and no spots for a killer play. Hard to imagine losing after that, but it was also hard to imagine losing after going up 305-84 with my play...


>Quackle: AELQTTU 15A T..QUATE +243 327
#note Whoa! What just happened to my 220 point lead?
>Mack: AEFILPP 14F FIPPLE +42 347
#note Quackle is liking PILAF at F2 considerably better. I disagree - I'd rather turn over the extra tile for the remaining power tiles and I don't mind opening the row 15 hotspot with several others (F6, row 8) open as well.
>Quackle: AAIJLUV F1 AJIVA +34 361
>Mack: ?ABIMST K4 BIgAM.ST +94 441
#note I saw BASMATIS on row 1, but if I can dodge a bingo this turn BIGAMIST will make it easier for me to close the board in the future. I'm going up by a bingo, so long-term bingo defense seems more important than blocking a freak 3*3 on this turn. Quackle also likes BIGAMIST better by a fairly large margin.
>Quackle: DILOTTU 1B OUTL.ID +27 388
>Mack: AELNNRW 15K REWAN +29 470
#note Quackle slightly prefers L1 REWAN, probably to block row 2 and column N. At this point, blocking bingos is more important than taking out the row 15 spot, so I think I agree in hindsight.
>Quackle: FIORSTU M3 OUTFIR.S +74 462
>Mack: DHILNOR 2B RHO +23 493
#note I really had no clue what to do here. N10 plays seemed way too risky considering they only score a couple more points than this, and though I could certainly lose without Quackle bingoing, I should have a significant edge being up 30 on a board without too many hotspots. Quackle thinks N10 HOLD wins 65% to RHO's 50%, but I think I still prefer RHO. I could certainly be wrong though, and I'm more than open to any suggestions.
>Quackle: DEEGSVX 3L G.X +11 473
>Mack: DGIILNO H7 D..ING +10 503
#note This blocks VENDEuSE and 7s with BIGAMISTS, leaving it impossible for him to bingo since he has no possible 8s to the N. It turns out this wins 100%, but with some really complicated endgame sequences I did not manage to think through entirely:

If I draw A, D, S, or ? I can't be stopped from going out and I win

If I draw an E, his best play is 12J SNED blocking ELOIN and TOILE to go out, then I win by 1 after J7 LONE to block MARVy and 6C AVEs

If I draw the N, his play of AXSEED loses by 1 to I4 LINO, and he can't score enough by blocking LINO since I still have plays like N1 LOX or 10E ELOIN for a high score

If I draw the V, AXSEED loses by 2 to VIOLA/VOILA and he can't score enough by blocking VIOLA since I play VOX

#note In reality, I didn't actually find this play. He had me worried for a second here!
>Mack: ?ILO 12K sOIL +17 520
#note COLIEs is 7 more, but this gets the job done. What a crazy game!
