#player1 Bernard Bernard
#player2 Josh Josh
>Bernard: EEGLMU H3 LEGUME +20 20
#note Bernard said the 4-point sacrifice was worth it because of not exposing the double letter scores. Interesting, but I disagree.
>Josh: ADGILLO I7 ALGOID +18 18
#note I thought this had the potential of getting challenged, so I liked it. I missed G(E)OIDAL 4G, which scores the same but is much better defensively, and LO(G)GIA 5F, which both look superior here.
>Bernard: DFI J8 DIF +35 55
>Josh: ELMNOTT H11 MOTEL +32 50
>Bernard: ILRT K10 TIRL +14 69
>Josh: ABNNNTV G6 NAV +23 73
#note I jumped on this when I saw it. I obviously considered exchanging too, and playing 4D BANN(E)T. I think this is worth it.
>Bernard: EOW 9E OWE +15 84
>Josh: ABENNOT 3C NOTAB.E +26 99
#note This seemed like a good position to go for more turnover and a more dynamic board, given Bernard's fishy play. But maybe BATON and BETON for 26 are too much equity to give up.
>Bernard: AK 2F KA +36 120
>Josh: DEJNNRS 14F JE.R +27 126
#note Ouch. Missing JE(O)N is really bad. I also thought DNNS was better than NNRS, and I am very much off about that. 69 7s with NNRS compared to only 51 with DNNS. Although in this situation, it's probably better to keep the D so that I can score if I don't bingo.
>Bernard: ?EEFIRT 1G FERTIlE +85 205
#note FIgTREE, FErRITE and FElTIER are 88. FElTIER looks best.
>Josh: ABDENNS 4D NAB +25 151
#note I need to play 8A BANED here, even though I am not sure it's a word.
>Bernard: COW 5C COW +31 236
>Josh: DEEHNQS 8A HEEDS +35 186
#note I need to play SHEND for 2 less here, because there aren't many E's left and because SHEND does a better job at opening the board for a bingo I need.
>Bernard: DEIT 10C TIDE +18 254
>Josh: AHNOQSV -NOQV +0 186
#note At this point I think I need to shed my Q, do I not? I don't see how I can win if I play 11B VANS. Maybe I'm missing something.
>Bernard: INTU K5 UNIT +17 271
>Josh: AAHINSY 12K .AYAH +30 216
>Bernard: AEY 13M AYE +32 303
>Josh: CIIPRSX 2M XI +27 243
#note Wow, there's still hope. If I draw an A or an N, I can 3x3 and jump back in the game!
>Bernard: QSU N10 QU..S +74 377
#note Or instead Bernard can draw the Q after playing four tiles and bomb me for 74 while simultaneously blocking any way back into this game.
>Josh: CINPRSZ 11B ZINS +40 283
#note didn't matter anyway. I missed P(E)C(T)INS, and that might work once in a blue moon and I draw an 100-point bingo next turn with the Z. Yeah, blew it again.
>Bernard: ANO B11 .ONA +26 403
>Josh: CIOPPRR 4K CRIP +23 306
#note I was going to play a phony, but I can't since he emptied the bag. PROPRIC(H) or PORPRIC(H) anyone? -4 to 14A P(A)IR
>Bernard: ?GORSUV B6 VO. +14 417
#note no comment lol
>Josh: OPR 15D PRO +17 323
>Josh:  (?GRSU) +10 333
