>Marty_Gabriel: AJRTU 8D JURAT +40 40
>Jackson_Smylie: AACEEOS F6 OC.EA +11 11
#note AERO wins the sim, followed by EA. If I'm to fish, I'm likely to play EA with the open R and T. I want to score points and keep the board open right now, OCREA does that. Perhaps OCREAE, but they sim about even.
>Marty_Gabriel: EPZ E10 ZEP +39 79
>Jackson_Smylie: AELOQRS H6 QA. +12 23
#note exch. OQ probably isn't that bad, cause QAT kinda kills the board.

>Marty_Gabriel: ?CDEIIU 13E sUICIDE +75 177
>Jackson_Smylie: EGOORSY H13 .OY +24 69
#note GOOSERY. GOOSEY is probably the play cause I need to bingo twice or score a lot and bingo.

>Marty_Gabriel: AEEIOTW 5I .OA +12 210
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEFKNU E3 FUNK +28 175
#note It's hard to say what's right. The right side a bit open (I'm hoping he plays through the O to open 8s lanes). KNUB 4K seems decent to set up an S hook, but I was slightly wary of doing that after HOA. I might still have to, cause I need to open those types of lanes. FUNK is to open the top, a new quadrant of the board (hopefully a d1 play or something opens it more). KENAF is probably the play to also open SKA.
>Marty_Gabriel: AIM D2 AIM +23 233
>Jackson_Smylie: ABBEINV 11I VIB. +18 193
#note M6 VIBE perhaps... I didn't see much I liked here. Hoping to open an S hook next turn or something.
>Marty_Gabriel: EW 3C W..E +20 253
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEEINW 10J BA.IE +30 223
#note maybe BOWIE? Better equity but i feel the lanes can be blocked fairly easily. He did creat a lane with WIFE though. BOWIE is proably the play, and he's quite likely to have an S after wife.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEFGILT 2F FLEG +29 282
#note He said this was his rack... he said he had a reason for playing this but I'm not sure what it is. WIth only AA left FIG seems cool.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEMNPW H1 W.EP +36 259
#note The M? draw was pretty perfect. Even just WEEP + a MAIM play can catch me up.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEIIRST O5 AIRIEST +80 362
>Jackson_Smylie: ?DEMNRT 1A TERM +38 297
#note wasn't 100% on DERM and the T there feels a bit better (I might be wrong).

#note Maybe the bag was incomplete, he went out with ER for 11. Final score 507-373.
