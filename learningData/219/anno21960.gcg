>Mack: EEFSSTT H8 EFT +12 12
#note Considered FETES, but felt that gave too much back while only scoring 12 more points and keeping a much less potent leave.
>Joe_E.: AKPU 10D KAPU. +17 17
>Mack: ?AEJSST D8 JA.ES +48 60
#note Obviously better than I2 JETSAmS, which I saw and passed up. Totally forgot about JAKEST+ at the time, but Joe's next play made it irrelevant anyway.
>Joe_E.: AADFINT C11 FAD +21 38
#note Actual rack.

>Mack: BEEEIOS G4 .EE +14 387
#note Debated this and 7M OBE. Decided to try to keep a better scoring leave to try and outrun Joe's bingo rather than try to block it but greatly reduce my chances of outrunning. The duck thinks OBE wins 90% to 86%, apaprently.
>Joe_E.: ADEIPRS K4 PRES.DIA +90 408
>Mack: ABEINOS 15A BASE +41 428
#note If I get the Q, I have 2 30-point spots for it, and if Joe has it, he probably can't go out in 2 even if he has a U, so I should be in decent shape here. This looks fine.
>Joe_E.: ACELLUU O4 CAUL. +11 419
#note Joe has no wins here.
