#note totally missed HILI, HWN synergy yeah! I didn't like WILI cause HHN looks gross, HHIL looks a bit better. HIN also is better, somehow I totally missed the HW > HH thing going on.

#note WHO wins the win, but it was tough to play. Tunn was telling me the night before not to worry about the board shaping too early, especially when the diff in score isn't huge. I was close to playing HOW, to keep 7 and L open, but WHO puts me close enough, and there are ways to open it and current openings. WHO is liked by Q.

#note Don't see the point in playing AAL or AA. AALS I considered for sure, it looks pretty good. AER is better if he opens, and for paralleling. ALSO is 36 points, and uses 4 one pointers and hits just a DLS. That cluster of points is crazy. Also trying to make his parallels 2 points worse.

#note REGALIAS!! I was sure it was just railages lairages gasalier. Damn. My studying did not pay off at all, as I missed SEMILUNE, and not REGALIAS. THese S's are coming in handy though.

#note Keeping up with the pace I've set for myself, I miss a third bingo in a row! SALFERN. I had no idea the bag was almost empty. Besides salfern, which wins 7/8, Q says FY wins 25%, and ALEF 16.67. I'm not sure what's right given YFERE, but I didn't see that, and had I thought about it I'm not sure what I would have done. Probably still ALEF cause nothing else looks good.
