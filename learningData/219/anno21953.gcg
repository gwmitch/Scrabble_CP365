>Jackson_Smylie: COORRRS 8G ROC +10 10
#note or exch. ORR, or CORSO. I don't really like CORSO, but CORS is way better than ORRS. I figured ROC didn't let him score very well. He is likely to play short after exch. 3 as well. wins the sim.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEIINRS J8 SENARII +70 94
#note J2 is better to keep the bottom more closed, but I was slightly less sure of CROCI.

#note CHEKA is the valid collins anagram. KITHE as well.

>Rob_Robinsky: ADIO 13G OID.A +33 146
#note I was close to challenging. I should have.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEINTVY 2G NAIVETY +75 244
#note NAIVETY closes a lot more than it seems... it blocks HETS. Leaving the N at 14a seemed bad.
>Rob_Robinsky: ??GIRSW L1 S.RoWInG +76 222
>Jackson_Smylie: EGLNNST 11C LENG +21 265
#note 18 vowels and 17 consos, so a play like DING is okay. LENG is fine for the same reason.
>Rob_Robinsky: ABBO K4 BOBA +34 256
>Jackson_Smylie: EMNOSTU 3L .UM +20 285
#note I blow the game here in some fantastic ways... firstly UNSMOTE. RUM also takes an E, not just the P. SOUM 1L (which I also didn't know) looks good. NOTUM M5 is probably the play, besides the bingo. RUM is not very good because I don't need to play like that. I also wasn't sure it only took a P and S, so I shouldn't be trusting my spotty word knowledge.
>Rob_Robinsky: JTU 13C JUT +28 284
>Jackson_Smylie: EENOSTX 14E EXO +33 318
#note Still very vowel heavy, so EXO is better in that regard. I was worried about playing EXON to set up those big points. EXO is probably fine, and hopefully I draw something good either at 15a (all those high scorers out) or bingoes. Oxen of course at o1 is the play.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEINSTZ O2 ZEATINS +107 391
>Jackson_Smylie: EINQRST N6 QI +64 382
#note I held for a long time, because my challenging was based on whether I would play Q(I) or QI. Q(I) has its advantages -- an A or E draw gives me bingoes both along 15 and N (ANESTRI/STEARIN, ENTRIES/NERITES). A 4/12 chance is decent given I'm down, but a lot of his plays could outrun (any loof play) so I don't want to rely on an N column bingo. He's very likely to try to block the 15 column, I think. QI is a lot harder to calculate... I can of course draw into bingoes, but I don't see any that fit anywhere else than the 15 row. ENRST is nice cause I can play H12 DINT if it doesn't get blocked, which makes 15a plays dangerous. If I was to play Q(I) I would have challenged, but I decided Q(I) probably doesn't win very often, especially against a perfect opponent, so QI is better, and if I'm gonna outrun I shouldnt challenge. Also, ZEATINS doesn't seem like desperation cause ZAS is still very good, or ZINES.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEGHIIO C13 .IG +11 402
>Jackson_Smylie: AEHNRST 15A AR.H +36 418
#note I had something like 2.5 minutes left here, and I was anticipating an endgame so I wanted to play something very quickly. I saw the threat of LOOF, which happens 75% of the time (realistically a bit less, cause if he has it with JIG he surely plays it). 36 points is a lot better than 26. I know if he doesn't have FEW he can't really win, but ARGH wasn't as clear. I took the immediate points and the future plays of I1 SITE hooking vatful. The real mistake here is spending far too long on QI and EXO. If I had time I could have probably seen that DINT wins always (according to champ). 
>Rob_Robinsky: EEFILOW 15G FEW +34 436
>Jackson_Smylie: EENST G7 E.N +8 426
#note The only winning plays are SITE, blocking VIOL and leaving me GENS to go out, or STERE/ESTER, which save EXON/DINE. This game was so interesting, and I wish I had a 35 minute clock to figure it out more. I was close to playing TENSE, but I was quite sure DRACS* was no good. I didn't look at his tiles enough, and just decided to do ERN then SITE... but EN has a lot more options than EST, so SITE I should have done. Either way, it was a misplayed endgame.
