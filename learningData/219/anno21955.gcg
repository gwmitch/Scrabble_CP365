#note I remembered Orry playing this (or was it challenging it?) in Vegas while I was annotating him, and it got challenged. I think it was against Nigel but I"m not sure. It definitely seems like a word, and I remembered something about it being good in collins or something. Obviously remembered wrong, and I should probably not risk it. It took Stefan a while to challenge even with the 5 point rule, but he made the right call in the end.

#note Didn't know roofier, or HOUGH. The whole tournament I had been pretty good about not playing a word if I"m unsure of it, but this game I slipped with HUGH and UNMOWED.

#note I saw OVERLIVE, but after UNMOWED and HUGH I was wary of playing words I didn't know. I can't tell how much of my decision was based on truly not knowing the word (overlive doesn't make a whole lot of sense, neither does overlier, overevil kind of does), and how much was the emotional aspect. VERBILE looks good. FROE is also worth considering.

#note Another example of a position where I didn't know whether to close or open. ERF and SERF are very worth considering, but FRAP has better equity. I want to outrun him, but I'm not sacrificing very much to close the ER, so perhaps just play SERF anyways. FRAP wins the sim but I'm not convinced.
