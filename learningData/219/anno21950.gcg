#note SDeIGNED is a bit better.

>Chris_Lipe: ELOQRTY H7 Q.YTE +17 185
#note Pretty sure he said this was his rack... OVERLY, INFIRMLY, GOY, OVERTLY, FREELY (F5) all do better. It's a tough call, and since I don't know the D hook QUYTE becomes better.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEHLNPV 15E .PHA +27 250
#note didn't know HWAN A12 or 15D NEVEL. I considered 4L HAVEN for a while, which I probably should have done. The opening of HAVEN is a lot more manageable than the opening of EPHA, even though I keep a V for future closing.

#note just klaverns.
>Chris_Lipe: EGIZ N10 G.IZE +38 318
#note He put down GRIZE, and I saw I could play VASE/GRIZES for 49, then he sighed heavily and shook his head and took it back. Then I saw GRIZE would give me ENCLAVES. Then he ended putting it back down, cause he actually only saw VASE, not ENCLAVES. Weird meta-interaction there.
