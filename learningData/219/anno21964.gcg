#note Not a word. I held and wasn't sure, but I figured if I just take my bingo next turn and even the game I'll have an edge going into the later stages.

#note An unusually paranoid play for me, but I couldn't really see myself losing being up 10 on a dead board with both the blank and X. I figured I'm more likely to lose to a bingo through the T than in the endgame on the board after RAIL.

#note I can score with the X at L12 next turn, and I need to stop plays like FROM.

#note There are plenty of better endgames than this, but I knew this won and spread wasn't really important at this point so I just took it.
