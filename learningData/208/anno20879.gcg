>Chris_Tallman: ?AEIOUU -AIOUU +0 0
#note My first tourney in 8 months, and my first using TWL15 (which I've barely studied). This should be fun :)
>Keith_Valentine: AILNW H8 INLAW +24 24
#note I knew this was no good in the old list but thought it might be new. Nope lol.
>Chris_Tallman: ?AEEOSS 13H SErOSAE +73 73
#note Beyond challenging, the best play is cASEOSE I6 for 72. My play scores one more but is vulnerable to getting challenged. I didn't think Keith would metagame me so hard as to play INLAW on purpose as pluralization bait, so decided to just play SEROSAE there (missed CASEOSE as well)
>Keith_Valentine: AEGILO L7 GOALIE. +18 42
>Chris_Tallman: AAENPTV K4 PAVAN +25 98
#note The sim likes this and NOVAE 8K about equally at the top. Didn't consider the pure fishes V(I)A and LAV 10L (which takes out the N10-N14 scoring spot), which sim closely too.
>Keith_Valentine: FNTY 11K N.FTY +22 64
#note I liked how this took out N10-N14 
>Chris_Tallman: CDEIIRT M2 DICTIER +80 178
>Keith_Valentine: ACTT -  +0 64
#note Held for a bit and challenged just as I asked for a courtesy draw. That old trick hehe
>Chris_Tallman: BEHIORV L1 VIBE +47 225
#note Saw BEVY first, but this is perfect. 98% to win already
>Keith_Valentine: ACTT O7 CATT. +30 94
>Chris_Tallman: HIOORTY N3 OHO +24 249
#note Wasn't sure on HOLO+, and didn't want to open with HOORAY. This is fine.
>Keith_Valentine: ILZ 10F ZI.L +33 127
>Chris_Tallman: IORTTUY G8 TO.T +12 261
#note Definitely time to block here. TRYOUT I3 is another nice play, but this has the added benefit of stopping opening/scoring plays making ZA. The leave isn't great, but that's okay.
>Keith_Valentine: DPRU 5G PURD. +8 135
#note Trying his best to force the board open, but scoring few points in the process. The board is dead for scoring too though.
>Chris_Tallman: EIRSSUY G3 YU. +12 273
#note I have the last 2 s's, so opening the YUPS lane and keeping EIRSS cant be wrong
>Keith_Valentine: EGK O1 KEG +31 166
#note Way above average scorefor him on this board hehe
>Chris_Tallman: ?EIQRSS 6E QIS +23 296
#note Drew Q? and then debated exchanging the Q and playing this. Missed a super obvious play for almost 100 points in the process. Expert :|
>Keith_Valentine: ALMR 4D LAR.M +27 193
#note This looked completely unfamiliar to me and I couldn't imagine he knew it as a new word yet...
>Chris_Tallman: ?AEOORS -  +0 296
#note And yeah :( I suppose I could've figured it out as the singular form of LARI
>Keith_Valentine: EIN F10 .EIN +16 209
>Chris_Tallman: ?AEOORS N11 .O.A +8 304
#note LOL ROADEOS C2. I do know ALARUM ofc but I guess my lost challenge frazzled me. I have all the hooks for this ad it virtually guarantees me a 3x bingo next turn and the win but still
>Keith_Valentine: IJNO 7C JOIN +32 241
>Chris_Tallman: ?ENORRS 15H cORNERS +76 380
>Keith_Valentine: AHW E11 WHA +39 280
#note I knew WETA+ before this tourney, but still, nice find by Keith.
>Chris_Tallman: EEEFMUX C7 .EUX +19 399
#note MUX+ plays for 25 at D13 but this is the optial endgame by 2 points. Threatening FEME to go out at 3B.
>Keith_Valentine: BDDEGRU 3C BED +17 297
#note Nice play by Keith here, 12 points better than GRUB 12D for 37 and the best play.
>Chris_Tallman: EEFM 8A FE. +18 417
#note Blocking RUED 8A and setting up EME B8 for a bunch to go out.
>Keith_Valentine: DGRU 12D G.. +14 311
#note -4 to D(U)G 9B, blocking EME
>Chris_Tallman: EM B8 .ME +22 439
>Chris_Tallman:  (DRU) +8 447
#note My tradition of winning first games continues. This one was decently played other than the few comically bad errors :P
