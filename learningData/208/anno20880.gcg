>Jill_Turney: GIPRT 8D GRIPT +20 20
>Chris_Tallman: ?BDENQU F5 EQU.D +35 35
#note Debated between QUIN and EQUID. I didn't have any of the hooks to QUIN, but it's still safer and simming a bit better. I wasn't leaving the E off QUID to keep the better leave because that's just asking for trouble. Also thought about QUERN E5 as the most defensive option, but that scores 5-7 less. 
>Jill_Turney: AEUV E2 UVEA +18 38
>Chris_Tallman: ?BEGNOT H4 BEGO.TeN +63 98
#note One of 3 bingoes and 6 placements available. I liked this one since I saw the possibility of MISBEGOTTEN for 45 and she might not.
>Jill_Turney: DNR 10G N.RD +8 46
>Chris_Tallman: AAIORSU D8 .IAOUR +14 112
#note This sims best. It does throw the R out into space and creates another S hook down there. Thought about DATO 9F to fish for MISBEGOTTEN and keep it more closed but that possibility isn't worth keep UI together. AU(D)IO as a pure fish keeping ARS is maybe an option too.
>Jill_Turney: NOXY K8 ONYX +36 82
#note ONYX used rock throw. Super effective!
>Chris_Tallman: AAIJLLS 3C JA.A +28 140
#note This fishes for MISBEGOTTEN again and sims well. I considered AJIVA too, but SILL > SLL. I didn't consider JARL 13B, but that keeps the much nicer AILS and only scores 6 less, so it might be better, idk.
>Jill_Turney: ACDEINR L2 DANCIER +75 157
#note She had CAIRNED for 79 and the sick CANDI(D)ER J5 for 78. This play was the best though, because it caused me to instachallenge. I should have taken a second and saw CAIRNED and realized that she wouldn't phony with this with that available. DANCIER blocked my bingo too though and I was frustrated hehe
>Chris_Tallman: EILLLOS -  +0 140
>Jill_Turney: EINOO 8J O..IE +5 162
#note At first she played down from the X on the 11 column, and I was hoping she would keep it and allow me to get LOLLIES down... but no hehe
>Chris_Tallman: ?ILLLOS 4C OL. +19 159
#note Instaplayed this; opening another lane for my bingoey leave and taking out the best scoring spot on the board.
>Jill_Turney: EEGLNO 13C E.ELONG +22 184
#note Blank hunting perhaps but I already have it :P
>Chris_Tallman: ?FILLST M7 F.LL +21 180
#note Didn't know the only available bingo here, ST(E)LLIFY. My play is within a few win % anyway. Debated between F(I)L and F(I)LL; not sure which is better.
>Jill_Turney: HIT 5J IT.H +18 202
>Chris_Tallman: ?EIIOST 2G OtITI.ES +70 250
#note At first just saw IOLITES/OILIEST in row 14, but those were dangerous. Kept looking and found the much safe option.
>Jill_Turney: OWY 1M YOW +34 236
#note Overscored by 4.
>Chris_Tallman: AEIRSSU B4 SAURIES +65 315
#note Drawing skillz
>Jill_Turney: BIMRS A8 BRIMS +46 282
#note Seemed weird that she tacked the case S on here. Guessing she had 6 consos, but it seems useful on future turns; maybe to set up a hook along the bottom row or to bingo with.
>Chris_Tallman: AEFKMPZ 3K F.ZE +70 385
#note YEZZZZZZZZZ
>Jill_Turney: AHW 1F WHA +35 317
#note Second game in a row this has been played on me for a bunch of points.
>Chris_Tallman: AAEKMNP 5A K.E +17 402
#note Tracked her as having VCCDTT instead of VCDETT and so wanted to stick her with something. This play was intending to block VAT/JOT
>Jill_Turney: CDETTV O3 DEV +26 343
#note Her best play by a mile
>Chris_Tallman: AAMNP I1 P.MA +27 429
#note PINA and MINA in the same spot are 1 better, but I was happy to find this anyway, blocking T(I)C
>Jill_Turney: CTT 11C C.T +10 353
#note ... But opening TIC J4! She missed it though..
>Chris_Tallman: AN J10 .A +12 441
#note Wtf missed DAN? 
>Jill_Turney: T 7L ..T +8 361
>Jill_Turney:  (N) +2 363
#note Another mostly well played game with a few more comical mistakes (mostly new dictionary related this time)
