>Matthew_Larocque: IINPTUW 8H UNWIT +18 18
#note I vowed to turn my tournament around after a disappointing 3-5 yesterday.
>Al_Pitzel: AEENOSU 9B AENEOUS +61 61
>Matthew_Larocque: HINOOPZ J8 .IZ +35 53
#note Man I took so long here, just to play (W)IZ. I decided that it was a good enough scoring play that I didn't need to hoard the Z around aimlessly. Also, plays like HOOP/POOH/ZOON seemed to block too many letters when I'm already down a bingo. I never saw either (E)PIZOON! That's nice and dangerous. PHO is a word now.
>Al_Pitzel: ADENOST M2 DONATES +77 138
>Matthew_Larocque: HNOOOPR 1L HOOP +48 101
#note Too bad I didn't still have the Z, but this is still a strong counter to keep me alive. PHONO is 51.
>Al_Pitzel: ??AERTU 6G qUARTE.s +58 196
#note WHAT IS THIS?! Tank confirmed. He played this so quickly too, when he has innumerable options that score much better.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEHNNOR L6 .N.HRONE +24 125
#note No, this isn't that good of a play, but it does a good job of opening and giving me 6 chances to draw an S which I will probably need to make this game respectable.
>Al_Pitzel: AFF 8A AFF +37 233
>Matthew_Larocque: BIKOSTY 10B BY +36 161
#note Almost played BY/FAY for less points just to make another S-hook. I did not know BOSKY which scores 52. BO(D)Y also an option, I know the O isn't the best vowel to hang onto.
>Al_Pitzel: AEY K11 YEA +26 259
>Matthew_Larocque: GIKOSTW 4L K.OW +30 191
>Al_Pitzel: IJUV E5 JUVI. +30 289
>Matthew_Larocque: ABGIMST 14E GAMBITS +73 264
>Al_Pitzel: AIQ 2J QAI. +39 328
#note Good thing he didn't have an S here.
>Matthew_Larocque: CDILLPR 15H ID +24 288
#note Geez I hate doing stuff like this but I figured he'd score here if I didn't. I didn't see plays using (HI)C(K) to keep my vowel.
>Al_Pitzel: S N1 .S +34 362
#note Wow. Well, I tried.
>Matthew_Larocque: CDILLPR 3I LID +19 307
>Al_Pitzel: GOX 15D GOX +25 387
>Matthew_Larocque: ACLPRR 13C CRAP +32 339
>Al_Pitzel: EET 5I TEE +14 401
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILRTV I13 L.. +5 344
#note Even though things didn't go my way, I stumbled upon a freak bingo that would win me the game here. Unfortunately, the odds of me drawing it were extremely low. Since I had nothing better to do, I went for it.
>Al_Pitzel: EM M10 EM +14 415
>Matthew_Larocque: CDIIRTV 10L ..D +8 352
#note Trying again, this time giving him something else to worry about.
>Al_Pitzel: EG 12J G..E +10 425
>Matthew_Larocque: ACIIRTV O3 A. +5 357
#note I should have played A(R) instead to setup my V if I don't get the bingo.
>Al_Pitzel: ELLNORR O7 ENROLL +26 451
#note There's the O, for VICTORI(A).
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIIRTV 6A VIRT. +10 367
#note TRICE 15K.
>Al_Pitzel: R I5 ..R. +5 456
>Al_Pitzel:  (CEI) +10 466
#note Does this mean I get to open with 3 bingos next game?
