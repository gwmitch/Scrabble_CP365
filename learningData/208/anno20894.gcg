#note F6 WOU(L)D is the other option here. It retains a more balanced leave, and it does a lot of good in terms of board control. The left side, especially the bottom half, will have to be reopened at some point for not that many points. WIDEOUT, though, scores better, for one, and also retains a better scoring leave than WOULD does. It also keeps the board relatively open. I actually wanted that against Deen. Normally when him and I play, the board gets very closed and I mess up. I wanted to make my decisions easier and run his time down, so I decided to play an open board.

#note For some reason, I didn't consider WEB in the same spot. That's a better play, but not by much, given the duplicate T's that will likely be a problem if Deen starts taking risks. 11C TWEET also looks better than this.
>Deen_Hergott: ACINOS O1 CASINO +39 124
#note Took him a long time to play this, but it seemed right when we debated it afterwards.
>Joshua_Sokol: BELOORT 12B BOOTER +36 198
#note This is phony. I should have remembered that. Could have been costly.

#note I was quite happy to be given this easy play. His time was dwindling down.
>Deen_Hergott: ALNU C7 ULNA +12 164
#note Again taking a while to play. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ALORTUY 8A RU.Y +33 273
#note I had no idea what BOOTER was setting up! BOOTERY is a new word. YOUR plays there for 49, clearly much better than this...

#note Couldn't figure how much better keeping the B was compared to the G. It's close.
>Deen_Hergott: EEITV M9 EVITE +22 210
>Joshua_Sokol: EGRSTUX N13 XU +27 362
#note I think it's correct to play this XU, to try to ensure Deen doesn't bingo quite as much, but with KIBEIS still open, maybe not.
>Deen_Hergott: AAAEE -AAAEE +0 210
#note yeah, maybe not...
