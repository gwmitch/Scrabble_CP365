#note Lol tech synonyms
>Mimmo_Rossi: FJU E5 FUJ. +28 41
#note Another U for poor Mimmo :(
>Chris_Tallman: AFILOVX D4 VOX +40 120
#note Didn't like using the O because I wanted to keep it for DUMBO. FOX is simming closely with VOX, likely because AILV is better than AFIL for bingoing, and this is a bingo-oriented board more than a scoring oriented one. This is better scoring defense though and I hate keeping V's, so this is fine.

#note Missed my second 100+ point play of the tourney, CAnFIELD for 101. Looked for 2x2's too but the only one is FIRECLAY and I didn't know it. I was vaguely considering DEFICIAL (like deficient), and that's phony but it turns out DEIFICAL (like deify) is good! I took the 4th best option at least, and it's a cool word for some consolation... Held but released unfortunately :(
>Mimmo_Rossi: DEIOORT 5H .OEDITOR +72 133
#note Eek more 3x3's open :(
>Chris_Tallman: DEHIRTU O2 HUR.IED +36 234
#note Knew DRUTHERS but not DRUTHER, which plays in the 2x2 lane for 44. I think blocking the 3x3 lane with this is just as good though. Played it up one space to block the D in DEVICE, not worrying about the N6 hotspot because the X is already out. 
>Mimmo_Rossi: AHS 6J HAS +32 165
#note I was happy to see him block the 3x3 basically for me here
>Chris_Tallman: ?AGNOTW N8 OuTGNAW +77 311
#note Only bingo
>Mimmo_Rossi: AEG 1A AGE +26 191
#note I was happy he took the 3x3 spot and basically blocked it for me.
>Chris_Tallman: ILMNNOS 15L LINN +26 337
#note Should probably just take the points for MONS, 3 s's still out
>Mimmo_Rossi: AEELSTT -  +0 191
#note Challenged OUTGNAWN. I was only like 85% sure it was good, so was happy to see it come up green :)
>Chris_Tallman: KMORRSS 13C KORS +31 368
#note Didn't know the new MOOK+, which plays for 42 at N3. Didn't know SM(E)RK either, which plays for 32 and blocks the 2x2 lane. My play is fine too though, everything is very close to 100% win.
>Mimmo_Rossi: IQ 4L QI +48 239
>Chris_Tallman: MRSTTYY M3 T..TY +31 399
#note This play is amusing and scores well, but STYMY I8 scores one better and stymies his bingo chances.
>Mimmo_Rossi: AEELSTT 11C ALE.TEST +66 305
>Chris_Tallman: MNPRRSY -  +0 399
#note Worst challenge in history. There are no words here folks. I was challenge happy this tourney and lost every single time lol.
>Mimmo_Rossi: AEP N1 PEA +23 328
#note Cool new 4 by Mimmo here
>Chris_Tallman: MNPRRSY H10 P.RRY +11 410
#note Thought about PRAY to set the S up, but ended up doing tis to block the scoring spot along the H column as well as freak bingoes from the A of OUTGNAWN - probably too paranoid but it doesn't much matter.
>Mimmo_Rossi: OW O12 OW +14 342
>Chris_Tallman: ELMNNNS 13M M.. +16 426
#note -5 to ENS 3A right away. I mistracked and wanted to block the M13 spot.
>Mimmo_Rossi: AABEIOU 10H .AUA +14 356
#note Cool new 4 by Mimmo
>Chris_Tallman: ELNNNS 3A ENS +25 451

>Mimmo_Rossi: EI 3H .IE +7 381
>Mimmo_Rossi:  (N) +2 383
#note Decent game, a couple of LOLworthy mistakes, just like my first 2 wins
