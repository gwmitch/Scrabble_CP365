>Matt_Canik: ELORWY 8C OWLERY +32 32
#note Play incorrectly scored as 36.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIMRSX 9A MIX +37 37
#note It's either this or DEX, and the DERS leave is clearly better than the IMRS leave of DEX.  'Nuff said.
>Matt_Canik: ACDNPT F4 PAND.CT +16 48
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEFRS A5 DEFA.ERS +95 132
#note The other bingo is PREFADES 4F for 80.  This scores 96.  79% to win.
>Matt_Canik: F 10A .F +26 74
>Jim_Burlant: NRRTUWZ E3 WUZ +56 188
#note Never have I been so happy to see UW in the same rack...and thank goodness for this new addition to the dictionary. Took me all of half a second to slap this down.
>Matt_Canik: BEGINT 7F .EBTING +23 97
#note Two months ago I wouldn't have had to think twice about challenging.  However, I haven't been anywhere near far enough into the new 7's to be certain about it.  Given the garbage I was sitting on, I didn't want to risk losing a turn challenging a word I wasn't at all certain about.  So, given that, and given that this only scored 23, I let it go.  DEBTING* is phony.
>Jim_Burlant: ILNRRRT -LRR +0 188
#note As I auto-piloted the exchange:  "You're not going to score 50?"  Not with this rack, Matt. :-)  It's not necessary to exchange, as  IRRUPT 4B scores 16; I missed it.  I don't believe the other options  (J6 NITRIL, GRRRL L7, H3 TRILBY) score enough to be worthwhile.  If you miss IRRUPT this is as good as anything else IMO.  But IRRUPT is best here.
>Matt_Canik: AKNP D1 KNAP +49 146
>Jim_Burlant: EINORST K4 TER.IONS +82 270
#note Any number of strong plays; row 11 bingoes OESTRIN and STONIER score 77; this scores 82.  'Nuff said.  93% to win.
>Matt_Canik: EEEIIOU -EEEIIOU +0 146
#note Matt jokingly put down these letters through the T on row 4 before pulling them up and exchanging all 7.  When it's not your game, it really isn't your game.
>Jim_Burlant: CEHJSSU 1A HUC. +39 309
#note I should have probably played off one of the duplicated S's with HUCKS, but I wanted him to think that both were still out there.  This or HUCKS is the play.
>Matt_Canik: OR C1 .OR +24 170
>Jim_Burlant: EEJOSSU J9 JEU +27 336
#note I don't think my priority is the same as Quackle's.  Q wants me to play 11C JOES for 35.  I sort of see that - it takes out row 12 and outscores this by 7.  But that still leaves all sorts of lines open for 8's on rows 9 - 11 where this limits him more.  I have enough of a lead that I can play a little more defensively than Quackle would like.  The sim indicates the only difference is equity; I'm 99.7% to win with this and JOES wins 99.8 but evaluates 9 points higher.
>Matt_Canik: EIMNR L1 MINER +26 196
>Jim_Burlant: ABEOSSV 1L .OVE +27 363
#note Couldn't think of VAMOSE, which was the play I needed to find. This wins every bit as often as VAMOSE, but VAMOSE is definitely the better play - both for clearing more of the rack and turning more tiles to hasten the end of the game, and give myself two more chances to land one of those unseen blanks. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEINRT 12A .ANTERIA +68 264
#note Still beyond bleak for Matt - even this only wins 0.75%.
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEOSS B3 BOAS +24 387
#note Anything is as good as anything.  If I really want to max out the score, G2 OBAS scores 29.  I just wanted to turn tiles and not open any easy scoring up.  
>Matt_Canik: GOTV H11 G.VOT +27 291
>Jim_Burlant: EELLQSY E11 Y.LL +14 401
#note I overthought this turn and got too cute. It struck me as being too early to burn my S; I wanted to hold that for a late lock-down defensive play or some big-scoring play with my Q.  I considered TELLY but backed off from that when I saw the pool - I thought it had too much potential for him to play something like AGA or ODA 14L that would force me to block for cheap and still be Q-addled.  Perhaps it was wishful thinking on my end, but given that  AADDIIIIU?? were unseen,  I thought this was a decent setup for a Q play of at least 50 points on my next turn.  As for Quackle:  Everything wins between 98 and 99% here.  Best per the duck is apparently L11 EELY.  Even if I'm not in rack building mode I can't wrap my arms around playing off both E's given this pool.
>Matt_Canik: DOOU N1 .ODOU +18 309
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEHQS O3 EH +21 422
#note Q prefers a bunch of 13B and 9F plays that don't defend anything.  I'd rather make sure he can't hit down the O column for 80, even if the leave is crappy.  I'm fine with this given these limited choices.
>Matt_Canik: G 9J ..G +11 320
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIQS 15F QA. +12 434
#note Just making sure he's limited to 70-point bingoes and that an out bingo is going to only give him no more than 16 points from my rack instead of 36.
