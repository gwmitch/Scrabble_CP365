>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ENOVW 8D WOVEN +30 30
>Matt_Canik: AEFIIUY -AFIIUY +0 0
#note I don't see (W)IFEY here. I can't pass up 28 points. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BJO 7C JOB +29 59
>Matt_Canik: CEEGINS E7 ..GIE +16 16
#note Sam revealed an A last turn, so I know he is able to play at 6D. That's why I played this instead of (V)EG or C(E)E. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: UX 9G XU +36 95
>Matt_Canik: ACDEMNS D11 MACED +28 44
#note Quackle REALLY wants me to play C(OW) for 8. Sam can't knock out WOVENS and the D11 spot. I guess I should do it. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADELMNT 14A LAM.NTED +76 171
>Matt_Canik: KLNOOPS 15G NOOK +35 79
#note NOOK over LOOK here because I like how the L meshes with the other L at A14, and because I think LPS is probably slightly better than NPS. Q agrees. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIV A12 VI.E +33 204
>Matt_Canik: HLPRSTY K13 PLY +20 99
#note Oooh H(EX)YL is neat. (Q actually prefers this though)
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AGIY L10 YAGI +20 224
>Matt_Canik: HIINRST M11 HIN +30 129
#note Not quite RHINITIS :(
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADW K9 WAD +33 257
>Matt_Canik: IILRRST 11B TI..R +7 136
#note Uhhhh what do I do here? TIRL/DAHL is 14 but just seems suidical. RI(ME) is great when I draw an E, but otherwise it's very meh. I like this play, or RIMER if I know the word. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: COR J8 ROC +30 287
>Matt_Canik: EIILLRS G7 L.. +11 147
#note Only two Is left, and he probably didn't have an F last turn or he plays OF/FAY. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OU 15C U.O +10 297
>Matt_Canik: AEIILRS 10A AIL +11 158
#note I guess this is the point where I should throw things open wit ILEA N10? 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEEQSTU N6 BEQUEST +88 385
#note That's just stupid
>Matt_Canik: DEIIRST O7 DIT +50 208
#note This should really be EDIT, or I could just bingo. I was thinking I'd need 50 and then two or three bingos to get back in the game at this point, and I think it's pretty much all moot right now anyway...
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AH 13G HA +23 408
>Matt_Canik: AEIORSZ A7 ZOE. +39 247
#note I see ZOARI(A) but I need to hold my I. ZOEA over ZOA because there are so many unseen vowels. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?AEFOST 13K ...S +25 433
>Matt_Canik: ?AIIRST 6F lIATRIS +69 316
#note LIATRIS+. Trying to draw a challenge here on the new word... I need a turn and another great draw to have a smidgeon of hope. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: FO F10 F.O +27 460
#note Held forever, finally accepted confusedly. Grr!
>Matt_Canik: EEEPRTU L3 PEE. +12 328
#note Come on matt the game is over just give it up
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?AENNRR 2G bRANNER +65 525
