#note beauty to start things off
>Joshua_Sokol: DEENNOT F9 ENDNOTE +66 96
#note and then silly silly vision by me. I kind of blanked on everything else when I saw ENDNOTE, forgetting its anagram. I looked for a while through the I and the A, seeing nothing. This is a chunky mistake!

>Seth_Lipkin: AOZ 14I AZO +34 148
>Joshua_Sokol: AAANPRT L11 PRANA +29 167
#note I saw L11 PAAN. But there were many R's out, so I didn't want to keep mine if it was a question of 2 fewer points. Then I decided between PRANA 15K and PRANA L11. I thought that the one-point difference was at least overcome by the reduced scoring 15K PRANA gave Seth, but ultimately decided that Seth's playfinding ability would make opening up columns M, N and O a problem, at least later on. This was probably an oversight, but I did not envision my PRANA going wrong in this way:
>Seth_Lipkin: ?AAEIIV J8 AVIAnI.E +83 231
#note Another smashing play by Seth!
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACHTW 13C CAH.W +34 201
#note I've been seeing the new words I know, but unfortunately not those I don't know. WATCHA+$ is new, and so it WHATCHA+$! What a word. It plays for 80 points. Another fat mistake on my part this game.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACILRT L1 CITRALs +82 283
#note Good thing I draw like a champion! Noteworthy is 3A LATIC(IF)ER!
>Seth_Lipkin: DRT 2K D.RT +10 261
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFLPTU H1 DEFT +41 324
#note Seeing DEFT, then 13I P(I)L(A)F, then 13I P(I)L(A)U, which is great because it ensures that I am scoring to defend my lead when not much else is possible yet. DEFT is obviously what I should play first, since PILAU immediately opens a lane that will create another big spot if it's hit, making DEFT virtually worthless.
>Seth_Lipkin: GOT J4 TOG +23 284
>Joshua_Sokol: LOOPQTU 1L .OUP +28 352
#note Time to get rid of that annoying lane. I have Q(I) for backup and there are two U's out. He would never imagine I have the Q here.
>Seth_Lipkin: ERS M12 ERS +26 310
>Joshua_Sokol: IKLNOQT 6F Q. +31 383
#note OK, Seth has created a low-value lane. I'm not worried about him hitting that lane that much. If I play QI, I can outrun him a large amount of the time. The pool is also not that good. I'm actually much more worried about him getting an extremely fortunate bingo at E5 such as BRASSIE for 99. This is clearly the right play. Also, drawing the L was nice, because now I don't have to worry about two possible bingos down O1, PSORALEN and PSORALEA.
>Seth_Lipkin: BEORS 11B ROBE. +16 326
#note Creating another lane is a good idea, but a low-value lane won't win Seth the game. After the game, I found ORBE(D) instead of ROBE(D), setting up S(ORBED). 
>Joshua_Sokol: IIKLNOT N10 KOI +20 403
#note from my perspective, ROBED was an odd play. But I was happy it came down, cause it made the pool much worse than it already was. I still don't want Seth to bingo though. Seems possible he'll win if he does. Unlikely, but possible. I looked at plays like LI(B) here to keep the K's scoring power in case Seth had a bingo next turn, but that seems to make it much easier for Seth to out-bingo, which is something I should be afraid of. Next I looked at D9 KI(B)L(A), which is the standard, points+leave outrunning play. I wasn't 100% on the word, but would have played it if I thought it was the best play. All the while, I was trying to decide if anything made more sense than KOI N10. The only thing Seth can do after that is overlap with an A and bingo, which seems nearly impossible, if not all around impossible. The only word that plays after KOI is HUSSARS, a word I did not know! ROBE(D) made me think Seth did not have an A, either, so this play seemed to make the most sense. If Seth doesn't have HUSSARS this turn, I think I am in business.

#note Just sealing the deal, I guess. I didn't want any freak occurences to happen so I played it safe here, spread not being an issue for me at all.
>Seth_Lipkin: RSSSUUV O12 SUSS +20 367
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILNT O6 TELIA +21 440
#note -5 to 7E NI(B), setting up TELAE or ELATE for 20.
