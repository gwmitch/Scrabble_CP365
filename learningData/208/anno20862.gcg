>Jim_Burlant: AEIIMNU 8H UNAI +8 8
#note I can't understand why on earth I chose to play through.  This is the best of the play-through options but best would have been exchanging IU.  This turns too many tiles and injects too much randomness for not enough gain.  
>Chris_Schneider: AHN 9H NAH +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: CCEEIMO 10I MICE +23 31
#note I may have screwed the pooch on the last one but this one hits the mark.  This is best - 51% to win.  Nothing else comes remotely close in a sim.
>Chris_Schneider: GLNU K10 .LUNG +16 33
>Jim_Burlant: AACEOST 13I CA.TO +20 51
#note Not that CANTO back hooks factored into this game, but I wish I'd thought of CANOE on this turn.  After I went back and forth evaluating the merits of various fishing plays before rejecting them, I saw this and put it down.  Immediately after hitting the clock, I second guessed myself - was this good?  Or was it phony and was I confusing it with CANSO?  This is legitimate and it's my best play, but the word confusion limited me on my next turn.  Regardless, this is best despite the volatility.  
>Chris_Schneider: OO L13 .OO +7 40
>Jim_Burlant: AABEPSU H7 B..A +15 66
#note See prevous comment about remembering whether I'd just put a phony down.  I wasn't sure if CANTO could legitimately become CANTOS (it can).  Best if I don't question my word knowledge is N10 PAUSE for 34.  This is actually a reasonable choice despite the points given up. And given the limitations of my word knowledge here, this was about as good as this position got.
>Chris_Schneider: Q K7 Q. +11 51
>Jim_Burlant: AEFPSTU 7F FU. +9 75
#note It's either this or M13 OAF.  The rack is potentially good enough that breaking it up with FEAST N10 sims well down on the list.
>Chris_Schneider: ORZ 15L .RZO +39 90
>Jim_Burlant: AAELPST 11B PALATES +75 150
#note This also plays eleswhere for 71 and 69 points; this scores 75 and is best.  71% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: EGINORS D7 RESO.ING +70 160
#note Chris has bingoes all over the place but this or M4 IGNORES are his two best choices.  He's 43% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIINY L3 GENII +23 173
#note Reasonable choice but not best.  One of the new 5's, GYNIE, is best; it plays at C3 for 23.  C10 YAGI is good; I whiffed on it.  This is the best of the rest.  44% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: BEOR M2 BORE +22 182
>Jim_Burlant: DDEESVY N1 DEY +29 202
#note It's either this or 13B VENDED.  Either play is as good as the other.  14D GYVED is also a reasonable choice in the duck's eyes.
>Chris_Schneider: AJPR 8A JAP.R +42 224
>Jim_Burlant: DEIOSVY O1 OY +32 234
#note I struggled with this turn because I was conflicted about shutting down O3 when I was sitting on my S.  The sim points out what I should have seen during the game:  whle this is a very strong play, ENVOY 13C (which I somehow missed at the time) would have been a hair better.  ENVOY wins just shy of 47%; this is the runner up, winning 45.3 and simming 1-1/2 points down at 1000 iterations.
>Chris_Schneider: DEIKTW 13A TWI.KED +34 258
#note More unfamiliarity with the new words.  TWINK is good; I thought it might have been a verb, therefore TWINKED seemed reasonable.  TWINK takes the S but does not extend with ED or ING.  Now I know.
>Jim_Burlant: DDEEISV 14F DEV +21 255
#note I considered 3 plays with this:  this, DEVEINED 56G and 5I VEINED 5I.  The appeal to this was that it killed something like GIF or an easy X dump.  DEVEINED maximized turnover but could have backfired if he was searching for some place to play a bingo.  This kept a potent combination and gave absolutely nothing back.  DEVEINED is best in Q's eyes, and this is a very close second.  I'm fine with this.
>Chris_Schneider: FIT F4 TIF. +18 276
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEISV 3B dEVISED +83 338
#note I had struggled with so many earlier turns that I auto-piloted this when I saw the S hook on TIFF without checking options on row 4.  VIDETTES 4A 82 or SEDATIVE 4B 80 should have been the play.  While this outscores those choices, this was a mistake that should have cost me the game, as it didn't do enough to seal off the northwest quadrant.
>Chris_Schneider: AAEMNST H1 MA. +18 294
#note If I'd played VIDETTES or SEDATIVE his only choice would be a board opening play.  This was his rack, and the break I caught was that he whiffed on AMENTIAS, which scores 70 at 5A.  Post mortem we determined the bag contained ELORX?.  After we filled out the result slip we replayed the game assuming he found AMENTIAS and figured out that I had no chance at a win.  Instead, watch what happens:
>Jim_Burlant: HILRTUW 5I WHI.. +22 360
#note Assuming he has the blank I cannot empty the bag and watch him bingo out.  I played this to take the bag to one while pushing my lead out to 66 points.  Examining the unseen pool, I saw a bunch of row 1 air balls for 60 through the M but nothing to the M.  And if he bingoes he's unlikely to have the X (granted, SEXTAiN is possible).  Regardless, if he hits down the N column he will give me counterplay at O8, which he may not be able to come back against.  A sim against an inferred fragment of AENST? says I'm correct to not empty the bag (against a random rack Q's suggestions are useless), but that I should block row 1 with WAUL 2G 14...but that scores 8 fewer points and leaves him easy 8's on row 4 that don't give any counterplay back.  I don't know what's right here.
>Chris_Schneider: AEENSTX 5E X. +18 312
#note Actual rack.  The blank was the last tile in the bag.
>Jim_Burlant: LLORRTU N5 ROLL +18 378
#note Thought process:  I can't block everything, so I have to make it as hard for him as possible.  If I block row 1, he's 100% certain to find any number of easy 70-point bingoes down the N column, which will cost me the game.  4's back-hooking WHINE block all N-column bingoes.  And, unlike ROTL or ROUT, ROLL makes it impossible for him to do anything down the O column since LE* is not good.  Now that I've done this, he only has 6 minutes to determine that his blank rack doesn't have anything to the M.  And, knowing Chris, he'll burn time looking for split 9's down the B column. While I figured he was 99% to find something like EASEMENT/ETAMINES to tie, that's better than gifting him the win by letting him hit the 7 he's 100% sure to see.  The duck verifies that this is the only play that ties.  Everything else loses.  Time on my clock when this went down:  00:02.
>Chris_Schneider: ?AEENST 1D bASE.ENT +59 371
#note As expected, he spent a lot of time looking for disconnected 9's down the B column and he didn't leave himself enough time to find row 1 bingoes.  Short on time (like me, he had 00:02 on his clock when this went down), he couldn't find the tie. Any number of bingos tie for him:  EASE(M)eNT, NESt(M)ATE, TAlES(M)EN, STA(M)ENEd, or ETA(M)iNES all score 60.  This loses by 1.
