>Murray_Weber: ABR H7 BAR +10 10
#note Eek a vertie
>Chris_Tallman: EELLOOR I7 OLEO +16 16
#note My play wins the speedy sim but the K10 hotspot is unneccessarily opened and just OLE is superior.
>Murray_Weber: DIIMT J8 TIMID +30 40
#note Immediately punished
>Chris_Tallman: EELNQRU 12G LEN.ER +16 32
#note Wasn't sure what to do here. There's no way at all to unload the Q; luckily I'm keeping the U too. This play is very open and I think I'd prefer to play Murray on a closed board. I missed (BAR)REL and (BAR)REN, which I think I like a bit better now.
>Murray_Weber: ?AIORSV 13B tRAVOIS +75 115
#note Lots of options for Murray here. I'm lucky he gave me such a favourable comeback play with this choice. I think of his available options, I like VARIOuS F6, which scores 77 and shuts down the left side quite effectively, save for the A8-F8 lane to the R.
>Chris_Tallman: AAEHQUY B10 QUA.E +66 98
#note I slapped down QUATE immediately and didn't notice I also had QUAY 12A for one less! The two plays seem equivalent - the Y seems like a reasonable scoring complement to the H here, but AHY ofc bingoes less than AEH.
>Murray_Weber: EPW 9A PEW +26 141
#note Very volatile play long term, setting up the huge EQUATE hooks and a hard to block S hook
>Chris_Tallman: AADHRTY 15A ADRY +52 150
#note I was pretty sure this was phony, but figured with the new dictionary coming out, it might not be challenged, and I was right. It turns out this is Collins and not new to TWL. The other option I saw was DAT(A)RY for 28. I missed ADYTA for 46, which I would have surely played instead of taking this pretty large risk. 
>Murray_Weber: WX D12 W.X. +34 175
>Chris_Tallman: AGHSTUZ A7 ZA. +42 192
#note GHAUTS/AUGHTS for 31 keep the Z, but this is 7% up on those plays and simming best. Was considering HAZY before he took the spot with WAXY.
>Murray_Weber: EY 14F YE +29 204
>Chris_Tallman: DGHJSTU H11 J..TS +42 234
#note Was considering JESTS vs JUGS M9/K5 before YE, but the extra points for YET pushed JESTS over the top for me. Also considered DUH/LIED, but not LIEU/UGH, which is better. JESTS is ultimately simming best. 
>Murray_Weber: CGINU L10 CU.ING +11 215
>Chris_Tallman: ADDGHRU B4 DURA +18 252
#note Spent a while here. I didn't like DAH 6G because of the ODAH hook, and RAH there kept too poor a leave. H(I)D 13K left huge hooks too. Eventually settled on DURA 4B, although I missed the similar RUGA in the same spot. I think both are decent chioces.
>Murray_Weber: AEEITV 4B .EVIATE +24 239
#note He had VENAE 14J at least, but decided to blow open and board and go for turnover (he said as much as he played this)
>Chris_Tallman: CDGHIST 5H DITCH +25 277
#note Didn't know the new 5 GINCH+, which plays for 30 at 14J. Failing that, this turn was super interesting for me. I was debating between D(I)GHT/D(I)TCH E3, DIGHT/DITCH H5, and CHITS K4, which would aim to shut down bingoes in 2 turns and go for a tight defensive win. I thought that was too extreme, and eventually took the most points and played the still pretty defensive DITCH H5. DIGHT is simming a bit better though since CS > GS. Another play I overlooked is just GID/DEVIATED, which shuts down scoring spots and keeps the nice CHST together. I think I'd have played that if I considered it. 
>Murray_Weber: KOR 15L .ROK +27 266
>Chris_Tallman: FGHOPST E3 F.GHT +24 301
#note This kept a much healthier leave than HOP(ED) for 33 and kept it for next turn if necessary while taking out the lanes on the left side. The sim likes the aggro F(I)G 13K for 19 keeping PHOTS, which I guess bingoes a lot. This play seemed more balanced though.. idk
>Murray_Weber: ?AEGLNN 3H LEANiNG +70 336
#note Only bingo for him - he had other stuff through the A and I if I didn't block there though. Annoying since if he doesn't bingo there ths turn, I shut it down and likely win hehe
>Chris_Tallman: AIMOPSU C7 PO. +28 329
#note Pretty big error here at a critical point in the game. PUMA 2J is 31 and sets up SPA (and I still have LEANINGS to use). MIAOU F6 is 30 and keeps a better leave (PS) as well. I liked keeping my M for the F6 spot, but keeping the IU combo is death for my outscoring and bingoing chances in a lot of scenarios. I like PUMA here I think. 
>Murray_Weber: IO H1 OI... +18 354
>Chris_Tallman: ABIMNSU O1 BASIN +32 361
#note Didn't know if BUSMAN or SUBMAN was good (BUSMAN is) and tunnelled on the LEANINGS hook and keeping the M and played this. NUBIA 2J wins 32% more often (60% to 28%) - BUSMAN is about 46%. Oh yeah, I also missed BIMAN(O)US, which wins 73.5% of the time. I don't think I knew it though. These last 2 plays combined cost me the game almost for sure. I also mistracked and thought that there were no more scoring tiles left in the bag, so BASIN + a play making HM would be enough. If I noticed the F in the bag I think I would have tried BUSMAN. 
>Murray_Weber: EFIL 2J FILE +33 387
#note Unexpected and very painful :(
>Chris_Tallman: MNOOSU F6 MOONS +30 391
#note MONOS 14J scores 2 more but I wasn't 100% sure on it. Should have went for it anyway and hoped to win in a recount. It's better than this by 1 point. 
>Murray_Weber: EET 10L .ETE +8 395
#note Just scoring with NET I12 is the best play over this by 4. 
>Murray_Weber:  (U) +2 397
#note Lots of interesting positions and plays in this one. I really blew it at the end though :(
