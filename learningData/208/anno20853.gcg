#note Ahh! EXECS has to be the play here. I have always been too averse to holding double Rs, to the point where I don't even consider plays that don't use at least one. 
>Darrell_Day: AP I6 PA. +20 139
#note He's pretty clearly sitting on an S and some bingo-ey stuff...
>Matt_Canik: ACEIRXY 12L C.AY +26 135
#note Bad bad bad bad bad. I whiffed on CA(R)EX here. And I thought this was good, but it's KRAY/KRAI and ORACY that got added. Not this. So much fail. 

I was thinking that I could set up a big play in the O column to counter his bingo at 5. There's a chance he could bingo with a Y but I don't think it's all that likel----

#note I don't think I can afford to play this at J1 now, I'm going to have to keep that line available.

#note Burning the last S so I can't play there with my S

#note I'm down so much, I think I have to create the variance that comes with this play. But man I HAVE to shed this X eventually.
