#note Ugh, terrible. Just didn't see FETCH O1, which scores more and clears out an extra consonant. I was starting to worry about time trouble and had to rush.

#note At this point I'm super low on time, and I'm not entirely sure whether "bingo by any means necessary" should be my goal here. TINCT O1 is less fishy and scores more - should I do that, or should I try to maximize my bingo chances with the IRTT? leave? There's also TIKI 14A, which makes the bingo line at the bottom easier to hit. Confusing position.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?BINRTT O1 BIT.h +24 421
#note Fishing the B can at least give me a 1/8 shot here - if I draw the E, he has no way to block both KNOTTIER 14C and RETINITE I8. I had nowhere near enough time to suss this out. Hadn't even spotted RETINITE as a possibility. I just gave up on winning and took the points.

#note Best is RUN(NE)T# for 14. A frustrating loss. I kept it close but just couldn't play well enough down the stretch.
