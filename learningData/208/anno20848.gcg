>Matthew_Larocque: GGINNRR 8G GRR +8 8
#note Sim agrees. I think the defense is too good to pass up.
>Michael_Bray: FNOT I7 F.ONT +13 13
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGINNY 10F GIN.Y +21 29
#note I literally wrote down EYING and thought it looked too weird - EYEING had to be the only way to spell it. One of many bad plays this game.
>Michael_Bray: KNOT 11D KNOT +21 34
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEEGIN 12C GIE +22 51
#note Missed GENIE for 30, which Quackle likes better, and that's not taking GI into account. I guess I should be more aggressive instead of playing short defensive words - there's good letters to draw still.
>Michael_Bray: AH J6 HA +18 52
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEENOW 5J WEE +21 72
#note I was going to play EWE instead, but thought I was giving him more options to bingo that way. WEE takes an awful lot of hooks though, and if he does bingo, I'm going to want to maintain an open board so I can catch up. Faulty thinking on my part. K4 WEEN looks good too, if he has bingo letters and no bingo, he won't score much at the hotspot I'm setting up.
>Michael_Bray: ADILV M1 VALID +26 78
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEENOT 1K CO.ET +33 105
#note Lol CENTAVO, I don't think so. Close between COVEN/COVET, but there's one more T unseen so I played COVET.
>Michael_Bray: MOP 13B MOP +29 107
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFNRU 4K AF.RE +30 135
#note Wanted to play FEUAR 9C, but decided to just take the points and not set up easy points for a 4-letter word.
>Michael_Bray: AQT I3 QAT +31 138
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIILNU 2M .HI +24 159
#note I figured this  spot was more dangerous than the Q spot, and they scored the same.
>Michael_Bray: DNOS 14A NODS +33 171
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILLNU 15A UN +17 176
#note Crappy position. J2 LI sims a little better than the rest, but I figured this was the most likely place he was going to play.
>Michael_Bray: ??DIIOS O4 .DItIOnS +71 242
#note Unless he has both the blanks.....
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILLOU N6 AIOLI +21 197
#note The small victories.....like finding the best scoring play with a junky rack. Unfortunately, outscoring him on this board looks pretty close to impossible. I probably should have played this down 3 and hoped for a lucky S draw.
>Michael_Bray: AEPRY M10 PEARY +24 266
>Michael_Bray: AEPRY --  -24 242
#note This better not be a new word, I thought to myself.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNRSUV M10 VULN +19 216
#note You know you want to challenge, Mike.
>Michael_Bray: AEPRY 12J REP.Y +20 262
>Matthew_Larocque: AERSSUW 10B WAS +25 241
#note I needed a bingo draw but I did not get one. Better set up something else to get his attention. Q doesn't agree, but I don't think I can rely on VULN staying open.
>Michael_Bray: AM 11I .AM +24 286
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEJRSU C7 JUB. +24 265
#note Cmon gimme bingo!
>Michael_Bray: AL 9A LA. +10 296
>Matthew_Larocque: DEERSTZ 14J ZEDS +42 307
#note Stupid Z go away. I gave up on the bingo, ZEDS puts me ahead of him, but I missed that I can just play ZED for 36. A long simulation favours (ME)ZE, but that's too easy to block. ET(U)DE looks good since it scores big without using the Z - that might be the play.
>Michael_Bray: IX J2 XI +36 332
#note Crap.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEORRTT D6 BOT +18 325
#note Ugh, I wish I hadn't run my time down so low, BO(L)TER is an easy find. Even just BO(L)T if I'm not feeling good about BOLTER being a word. I threw this game away.
>Michael_Bray: ACEEEEU E5 CEE +24 356
>Matthew_Larocque: ERRT K7 RET +9 334
>Michael_Bray: AEEU A7 EE. +9 365
>Matthew_Larocque: R G8 .R.. +6 340
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AU) +4 344
#note I actually managed my time much better than usual this tournament (I only went over on 3 games!) but this was the one instance where it changed the outcome.
