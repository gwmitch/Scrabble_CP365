>Joshua_Sokol: CDEIRTX --  -100 0
#note I was 60% sure this wasn't a word in the previous dictionary update. I was also 60% sure Michael wouldn't challenge, firstly cause I have a long history of playing phonies that he doesn't challenge and valid words that he does challenge, and secondly because of how much sense this word made. DEXTRO as a prefix (it's also a valid word), means "to the right". Anyways, all this is besides the point. This was way too greedy! Just take 44 and at least a 65% chance of winning with XERIC...
>Michael_Fagen: AADNOOT 8H ADO +8 8
#note Well, Michael didn't know the new ODONATA+! 8F ODA looks to be his strongest play here, as overlaps after my next play will benefit him. This is around 12 points back on a Quackle static evaluation.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEIRTX 9H XERIC +30 30
#note I should probably play 9H XED here!
>Michael_Fagen: ABINOTU L3 BOTANI. +24 32
#note Michael doesn't want to keep a U here, but his best scoring plays do keep it. Perhaps 7F BATON makes the most sense, to cut both my bingo and scoring chances.
>Joshua_Sokol: DGGINOT 7H TOG +24 54
#note things aren't looking too bad despite my lost challenge. I'm a favorite to win at this point.
>Michael_Fagen: ?EINOQU 5E QUOtIEN. +114 146
#note well, if that's not a nice 6 tiles to draw to a U! Serves me right for phonying...
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGILN 10F GLIA +25 79
#note now completely lost as to what to do, I just take points+leave after a long 5 minutes of agonizing over this position. I suppose (BOTANIC)A is worth some thought!
>Michael_Fagen: EEMNOST M3 EMS +39 185
#note Such a shame Michael's bingo bango draw couldn't play.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEIJNO H1 JOIN. +36 115
#note H1 EEJI(T) looks a decent amount better than this
>Michael_Fagen: CDENOT 3C DEONT.C +28 213
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEMRU 4A DEEM +29 144
>Michael_Fagen: AGW A1 GAW. +27 240
#note I can't believe I let this go! I thought it was a new 4...

>Michael_Fagen: AP 1N PA +31 271
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLRU E5 .UIRK +18 189
#note Don't know what my last tile was.
>Michael_Fagen: V C3 ..V +7 278
>Joshua_Sokol: EILORRS B1 OR +11 200
#note hoping he opens or something, cause I'm buried. I1 OR(C) is 16.

>Joshua_Sokol: BEHLORT B10 BO.LT +30 279
#note 13F THROB
>Michael_Fagen: ADEIZ A6 ZEIDA +49 443
#note This is the second word I've let go thinking it was new. This has never happened to me in games against Michael. The tables really turned this game!
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHRVY C7 VERY +23 302
#note pretty sure he doesn't know LATH here. Normally this would be -6 but yeah, he doesn't know LATH.
>Michael_Fagen: EHLRSU 2E HE +16 459
>Joshua_Sokol: AEH 13G HAE +22 324
#note I don't think I've ever played so poorly against Michael! What a phenomenally bad experience.
