>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAADDT 8G DADA +12 12
#note The last tile I drew was the third A, I was really hoping for DADAIST.
>Timothy_Anderson: IKLMY 7H MILKY +25 25
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AISTTU 9A SITUATe +59 71
#note The only other bingo is TUrISTA, which I forgot, thinking it was only TOURISTA.
>Timothy_Anderson: OVW A6 VOW. +30 55
>Matthew_Larocque: BFHJMOT D8 J.MBO +48 119
#note Lucky to have a play such as this.
>Timothy_Anderson: AAER 8L AREA +21 76
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFGHTX 9L HEFT +30 149
#note Close call, but anytime I can score well and still retain the X, that's what I usually do. HEX/HEFT are pretty much even via the sim.
>Timothy_Anderson: EGILLNS 13D SELLING +77 153
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEGXZ H11 AZ.DE +75 224
#note The only money I won was 5 bucks for this play (which was tied with another 75 point Z-play).
>Timothy_Anderson: AQU J10 QUA. +34 187
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFGTTX 10M EFT +37 261
#note Didn't see EX(E)C, but it's close between that and EFT. 
>Timothy_Anderson: OW E11 OW. +25 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCCGTX -BCCGX +0 261
#note With the blank draw, and no juicy X spots, I decided it's better to just bingo ASAP. 
>Timothy_Anderson: OPR K4 POR. +20 232
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DNOORT 15H .NROOTeD +77 338
#note Best scoring bingo - good thing it's an easy one to find, because I forgot about OMA here.
>Timothy_Anderson: EINN 14L NINE +17 249
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIOX L1 IXIA +32 370
#note Wasn't sure which IXIA was better, the other one gave him easy overlaps, this one gives him an I to bingo through.
>Timothy_Anderson: AEGNNR 1H NEAR.NG +24 273
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEHOTU 2J HE. +36 406
#note COUTH! I like that way better. So much better defense. Also noteworthy - OUT/HOU extensions to SELLING.
>Timothy_Anderson: CEU 2F CUE +13 286
>Matthew_Larocque: CEOORTU 6F COO +16 422
#note Didn't know what to do, so decided to test Timothy on the new threes. TE(L)CO is 24.
>Timothy_Anderson: ER 13B RE....... +20 306
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGRSTU N1 .URGE +14 436
#note At this point I was looking for an out-in-two, except the bag isn't even empty yet! I almost always check the bag near the end of a game. Did I forget this time?
>Timothy_Anderson: BIILPSY A13 PLY +37 343
#note Clever setup by Tim here.
>Matthew_Larocque: EISTV F11 TE.S +17 453
#note I play out, Timothy challenges, and we don't realise that there's still VI in the bag! Later on when the board was getting cleaned up, the board's owner notices this, but since the slip was already signed and the results were entered, we couldn't do anything about it. Sorry Timothy!  Score ended as 465 - 348.
