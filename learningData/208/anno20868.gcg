>Matthew_Larocque: AEIILUY 8E LIEU +8 8
#note An exchange rack, but my thinking was that playing LIEU was still better than letting her have first crack at the board.
>Maureen_Morris: EEGMNRT F3 METER.NG +67 67
#note Or that could happen.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIIOSY 7C DIA.Y +26 34
#note I did not know DAI(M)YO.
>Maureen_Morris: AEMOSTU I5 OUTSEAM +66 133
#note I know I've looked this up before and saw that it was phony! But I still think it's a word!
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIIOSS H11 AGIOS +28 62
>Maureen_Morris: EJRV 13G J.VER +27 160
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEIOOS 8A COO +18 80
#note I putzed around debating if COO for 18 was better than just dumping off OO. My chances are slim but COO clocks in at just over 11% to win.
>Maureen_Morris: DEX 12J DEX +27 187
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEINS 15A ANISEED. +80 160
#note I needed that.
>Maureen_Morris: ??GILNU A5 pLU.kING +61 248
#note This is the 5th time this tournament an opponent double-blank bingoed on me! And they all rushed the play, sacrificing 20+ points just to play it as fast as possible! 
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEIOP 14B OBIA +24 184
#note It was this or POI 11K, but I didn't want to keep AEEB and the X spot can be used more than once.
>Maureen_Morris: EV L10 VE. +13 261
>Matthew_Larocque: EELPRTW 14J PEWTER +49 233
#note WELTER is 52, and keeps the P to score.
>Maureen_Morris: IOT O12 TO.I +15 276
#note I needed that break.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABELQTY H1 BELAY +38 271
#note Q(U)BYTE is cool. Sim is liking BAL(M)Y a little better. I do have the last E, and vowels are getting short. I should have looked a little longer.
>Maureen_Morris: AF B8 .AF +28 304
>Matthew_Larocque: HNOOQST J6 HO +28 299
#note Wow, I really needed to see S(U)Q here. Game-destroying miss.
>Maureen_Morris: APR 11K P.AR +24 328
>Matthew_Larocque: CNOQSTT 13B COT +28 327
#note I felt like I wanted to keep scoring to put some pressure on her and hopefully she'd make a mistake. But dragging this Q around did not make me feel optimistic. 23.5%.
>Maureen_Morris: ADN E10 AND +11 339
>Matthew_Larocque: HNQSTWZ D6 Q. +11 338
#note She wasn't able to score well this turn, which was the break I needed because I can't score well either because I missed S(U)Q.
>Maureen_Morris: IILNRRU 4C RUN. +8 347
#note I'm not sure that this was her rack, but I can't see her NOT playing the K if she was holding it here.
>Matthew_Larocque: FHNSTWZ J9 SH +28 366
#note This was it. I was either going to play F(E)Z or SH. My timer was on the egde of expiration, threatening to foil my chances of winning. I was under the impression that I NEEDED to play SH either now or next turn to win the game. This is not true. I didn't even see (YO)WS. I play F(E)Z now and I can score big points no matter what next turn. However, if I  play F(E)Z and she blocks SH, AND I don't see (YO)WS, then I lose.
>Maureen_Morris: IIKLR 3F .I.K +16 363
>Matthew_Larocque: FNTWZ 10D Z.. +13 379
>Maureen_Morris: ILR I1 IL. +13 376
#note All she has to do is play BIRL here! IRK is also better than ILK because if I play (YO)W she can tack the L on for 20! 
>Matthew_Larocque: FNTW N13 W.T +13 392
#note I still don't see it, and it's the only winning play. This loses!
>Maureen_Morris: R 11G R.. +5 381
#note She misses the 8 point spot!
>Maureen_Morris:  (FN) +10 391
#note It's official: We both should have been awarded -50 point forfeit losses.
