>Matt_Canik: ELORTWY 8C OWLERY +32 32
#note Looking for the challenge, else I play YOWLER. OWLERY+. Was not even held, though he said after the game that he didn't know the word. 
Somehow counted this as 36 instead of 32 because math is hard. 
>Jim_Burlant: IMX 9A MIX +37 37
>Matt_Canik: ACDNPTT F4 PAND.CT +16 48
#note Wow, quackle has TAMP or DAMP or CAMP all about 5 points above this. Apparently, Jim scores 8 fewer points per turn without that M available. 
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEFRS A5 DEFA.ERS +95 132
#note I guess you were right, quackle!!
>Matt_Canik: EFGINNT B9 .F +26 74
#note I see (P)FENNIG, but I don't think I need to blow up the rack. This bingos an awful lot. Q would rather I play FE B6 for 5 more though. 
>Jim_Burlant: UWZ E3 WUZ +56 188
#note ow.
>Matt_Canik: BEGINNT 7F .EBTING +23 97
#note Jim's lack of a hold, along with prior knowledge of playing him, inspired me to play this (mostly) intentional phoney. It wasn't held. Fishing seems way weaker now because it's pretty tough to bingo here. 
>Jim_Burlant: III -III +0 188
>Matt_Canik: AEIIKNP D1 KNAP +49 146
#note Options: KI 6J 34, PAIKIN(G) 34, KNAP D1 49. After Jim's ex3 I want to address the 2x2, but then I can see this board getting very closed in on me. If he has a bingo, I can respont with big plays through the K most of the time. In a tournament where I've been overfishing, this is a rare "underfish" where I grab points when I shouldn't have. -8ish
>Jim_Burlant: EINORST K4 TER.IONS +82 270
#note :(
>Matt_Canik: EEIIIOU -EEIIIOU +0 146
#note Initially I set down EI(E)IEIOU#, but then realized two problems with that: a. I was not playing CSW and b. it stretched one square off the board. Argh I hate playing TWL!!!!!!

#note Yep this is more like it
>Jim_Burlant: ELLY E11 Y.LL +14 401
#note Jim should have played (T)ELLY here, I think. 
>Matt_Canik: ?DGLOOU N1 .ODOU +18 309
#note Choose this over VULGO because there are so many vowels unseen and Jim just played three consonants. 
>Jim_Burlant: EH O3 EH +21 422
>Matt_Canik: ??ADGIL 9J ..G +11 320
#note I think I might be able to squeak out a win if I bingo out and catch Jim with the Q if he blunders next turn. Maybe I try AG/PUPA and look for a miracle 9 when he inevitably blocks the bottom. 
>Jim_Burlant: AQ 15F QA. +12 434
#note Aw
