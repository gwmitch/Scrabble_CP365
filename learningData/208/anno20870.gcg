#note How to win the impossible game, part 3! Start off strong...
>Michael_Fagen: ACELRSW 9B CLAWERS +74 74
#note Enjoy your opponent's 5-point equity loss to start things off, but not the fact that he drew into a bingo on turn 1.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAKNPR D8 P.RKA +28 52
#note Try to keep all quadrants of the board open, being down a bingo early, arguably. You probably should have phonied, at this point!
>Michael_Fagen: GNOO 4H .ONGO +16 90
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEHINU 11D .AHUNA +26 78
#note Start playing a second game against another player, and just autopilot, and start losing small amounts of winning chances every turn. B9 (C)HAINE was the play here, most likely.
>Michael_Fagen: DEENORV K4 .OVERNED +102 192
#note Now, really start to autopilot!

#note See your sliver of hope with a clutch draw! Especially when your opponent notices the clutchness of your play and complains about how lucky you are!
>Michael_Fagen: AEHILRS C1 HAILERS +79 418
#note Shrug... Challenge cause it's your only hope, even though you know full well this is a word...
>Joshua_Sokol: ILORTTU -  +0 312
>Michael_Fagen: AOZ B1 AZO +53 471
#note Start crying inside when your opponent claims that "this is fun!". Accept Schadenfreude as a normal human behavior.

#note Don't give up just yet!?!
