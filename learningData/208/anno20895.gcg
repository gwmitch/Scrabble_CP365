>Joshua_Sokol: CEGIIUX H7 CIG +12 12
#note After playing this I noticed XU. I still prefer my play, but I should have considered XU.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: UV 9F VU. +8 8
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEITUX F9 .AU +8 20
#note Thought this was a cute setup. EXU(V)IA I missed, and AUXETI(C) doesn't make enough sense.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IIII -IIII +0 8
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILOTX E10 AX +38 58
#note Plays forming (AX)E after this are kind of problematic, but nothing else makes sense here, except AXILE, if you know that AXILE does not take an S! I did not know that for sure.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ACEG 12B CAGE +24 32
>Joshua_Sokol: BEILLOT 13E LIBELOT +74 132
>Joshua_Sokol: BEILLOT --  -74 58
#note Thinking of BIBELOT. If I had seen BOLETI or BILLET, I hope I would not have attempted this one.

>Bernard_Gotlieb: DEW 13E DEW +23 93
>Joshua_Sokol: DELLSTU 7H .ULLED +12 97
#note Did I have the S here? I don't remember... I know I saw SCULLED as a possibility after this play, but wasn't 100%.

#note ooooh, that disconnected nine is beautiful! Also, I did not deserve this.

#note Missing L3 HEA(RE)R :(
>Bernard_Gotlieb: IK 4L I.K +29 207
>Joshua_Sokol: AEOOOQS O1 OE +38 303
#note There be the O's. Insane that Bernard didn't have any O's. I thought I was going to get burned after JIN.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EMW 9A MEW +24 231
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOOQS -IOOQ +0 303
#note If I don't think Bernard knows SCULLED I should play QIS/MEWS maybe? I should also probably throw back the A, despite the pool being conso heavy.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EHT A6 THE. +27 258
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEOSSY 7A .OYA +14 317
#note Wasn't sure what to do here, I guess ASSAY O11 was fine. I just wanted to keep one S for whatever reason. I wanted his bingos to expose a triple if he had any.
