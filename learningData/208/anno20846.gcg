>Huguette_Settle: EIPTY 8H PIETY +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: CLORSST J3 COSTR.LS +64 64
#note At first this looked like it was going to be a crappy position, but I actually found one of the bingos for a change and bailed myself out. I didn't know CROSSLET, though.
>Huguette_Settle: IQ 9G QI +25 53
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIRSU 5C RESIDUE. +68 132
#note I always see UREIDES immediately with this rack, but since it didn't play I shuffled to see if anything else materialized. Yes, I had to shuffle to know I had RESIDUE. There's a reason my rating keeps going down.
>Huguette_Settle: EKOW 4D WOKE +43 96
>Matthew_Larocque: AIOOORV 10F VIA +30 162
#note Bad leave, but I can't turn down 30 points.
>Huguette_Settle: ?AACELM C3 CA.AMELs +92 188
#note She's not finished just yet.
>Matthew_Larocque: ELNOOOR D8 LOO +10 172
#note Don't ask why I didn't just play OL(E)O. I just have random lapses in games for no reason. I wanted to take the spot out, but never thought about using it outright.
>Huguette_Settle: DU 8A DU.. +15 203
>Matthew_Larocque: EHMNOOR 3G MOO.HER +45 217
#note Thankful that I took the time to see this.

>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHNNX 4L HEX +38 255
>Huguette_Settle: AT B6 TA. +13 250
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGINN A6 EN.ING +16 271
#note I decided it was pointless to play short and fishy here - the board is messy now so I wanted to keep the pressure on her to keep up.
>Huguette_Settle: BL A4 BL...... +15 265
#note Right off the bat I'm considering *PREBLENDING if I get the chance.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFGINO 5M FIG +22 293
#note Taking a risk, I thought the G was a reasonably safe letter to stick out there. I thought it was better than plays on top giving her big TWS points. Q says I should risk 2L FIG and hope she doesn't have an A.
>Huguette_Settle: AIT O5 .AIT +15 280
>Matthew_Larocque: ADNOOVW 9L AVO +15 308
#note Gotta block.
>Huguette_Settle: TTU 2M TUT +13 293
>Matthew_Larocque: DNNOSWY 10N WO +26 334
#note I can't remember why I didn't play YO instead. Oh, right, because I'd still have (LOO)NY in case I have no vowels next turn. Lol. 
>Huguette_Settle: ADEJ 11K JADE +30 323
>Matthew_Larocque: DENNPSY 12L YES +32 366
#note Big mistake says Quackle. I guess I felt like I wasn't far enough ahead to make a weaker scoring play.
>Huguette_Settle: NU 1N NU +14 337
>Matthew_Larocque: DINNP M11 ..NI +10 376
#note I know for a fact that this does not take an S, but does Huguette know that? I didn't get my rack unfortunately.
>Huguette_Settle: ?BEINR 15H BRINEs +29 366
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGNPRZ H1 AZ. +36 412
#note The Z draw kind of affected my thinking. Even though I was planning to challenge, who knows what was added to the new words? I went overtime on this turn, so I didn't even have time to do the math here, but it seemed like AZ(O) would put me out of reach. 
>Huguette_Settle: AR K11 .AR +17 383
>Huguette_Settle:  (DGNPR) +18 401
#note Originally I had won by 3, but we recounted and she underscored her bingo by 2 points. I got lucky I didn't blunder this one, and really highlights my problems..... leaving way too little time for the end, and not trusting myself on words I know. So even though I won, I didn't feel like I earned the victory at all.
