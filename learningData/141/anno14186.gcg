>Huguette_Settle: BDEINRT --  -70 0
#note She does have a valid bingo here which scores 94 as a 2x2.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFGLQV -EFGLQV +0 20
#note Normally, if I knew her bingo and she knew her bingo, then blocking the best spot probably makes sense. Otherwise I think I need to exchange.
>Huguette_Settle: BDEINRT E4 BRID. +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMU 7G EMEU +19 39
#note Didn't get this rack, but I know it was full of vowels.

#note Highest scorer is (B)EECHnuT.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGOOUY A5 .OOEY +30 69
#note GUYO(T), a five I did not know.
>Huguette_Settle: XY -  +0 78
#note She later commented on the silliness of the challenge while holding XY.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GLNTUU 4H ULU +7 76

>Huguette_Settle: ADEW 2J .AWED +32 194
>Matthew_Larocque: GINOORS 15A ROO.INGS +131 317
#note I'm not sure how to feel about this. Good? Bad? Lucky? I'm not going to get away with 131 points against pretty much anyone, and here I am with 131 points for a non-word.
>Huguette_Settle: AIN 1M AIN +14 208
>Matthew_Larocque: FLPPTUZ F5 .F +26 343
#note This seemed like a lazy "good enough" type of play, waiting to see if Huguette gives me anything.
>Huguette_Settle: ACE 13B AC.E +12 220
>Matthew_Larocque: LMPPTUZ B13 .Z. +24 367
#note I missed the turnover play of PLUMP(S). (ME)TUMP is a funny word.
>Huguette_Settle: AQT H12 QAT. +23 243
>Matthew_Larocque: GLMPPTU 6J MUG +22 389

#note Odd, she can score a lot more with these letters.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILLRT 14J LITAI +18 432
#note Just attempting to bait a phony s-hook, but if I know PAPAL than ILIAL plays for 19.
>Huguette_Settle: ST J12 S..T +16 293
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIKLRR 13M KAE +28 460
#note KRA(UT), and in this spot ILK/A plays.
>Huguette_Settle: IRS 15M SRI +19 312
>Matthew_Larocque: AFILRRV F10 VAR +32 492
#note Missed ARRIV(E), although this sims better.
>Huguette_Settle: ILNSV O10 LIV. +11 323
>Matthew_Larocque: FILR C3 F.. +18 510
#note Didn't have time to look extensively. Although, if I lose 10 more points to find my out, I increase the spread, but don't score 500 anymore.
>Huguette_Settle: NS K5 N.S +13 336
>Huguette_Settle:  (ILR) +6 342
#note -10. Not really deserving of 500 points, but I'll take it.
