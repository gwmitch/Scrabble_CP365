#note Taking out the problematic lane.  I forgot to write my racks down for the next three turns.  I know I had NORRZ though.  The O was my only vowel.

#note It's starting to aggravate me that I didn't write these racks down.  I'll try to remember them later.   I know I didn't have any other vowels.  This is why WEEDY was such a mistake.  I was in vowel trouble for the rest of the game.
