#note DOURA is 26, but I keep thinking that it requires the H to be valid.

#note Thought I could sneak this by, but playing a phony four is never a good idea. If this was a tournament I wouldn't do it, but I don't mind getting silly in casual games.
>Huguette_Settle: IIII -IIII +0 79
#note Ouch! 3 turns where she didn't score any points.

#note sEXTA(I)N plays for 62 - though she could do some serious damage in return. Sim likes my play, however.

#note I saw TANNAgE and thought for sure it was invalid! Ugh. And I also noticed ANdANTE after it was too late. I didn't know TANNATE and the L-hook on ANTENNA, but I've played NEoNATA(L) before! Now I'm just bombing hardcore.

#note Played pretty well in the first half and sucked in the second half - need to improve my consistency so I don't choke away games.
