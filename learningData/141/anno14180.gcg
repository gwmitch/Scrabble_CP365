>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINNS 8H INNAGES +70 70
>Al_Pitzel: ?AEKORS 9B sOAKERS +64 64
#note He really missed out here, many bingos score more points. The tricky 2x2 kAR(A)OKES scores 94.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEGJTW D8 J.WED +48 118
>Al_Pitzel: AILNU L5 LIN.UA +7 71
#note Odd.... but sets up some hooks.
>Matthew_Larocque: BFGLOOT E11 FOB +29 147
#note I guess I might as well play FOG instead, since I'll probably score better with the B next turn.
>Al_Pitzel: PQU 6J QU.P +35 106
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLNOT F2 ELONGAT. +65 212
#note Having missed this bingo last tournament, I played it without a second thought. This caused me to forget about TANGELO which makes use of the L-hook. Blah.
>Al_Pitzel: CEIST N2 CITES +36 142
>Matthew_Larocque: EIRRUWZ 3A WURZE. +36 248
#note Again, the moment I noticed this I just threw it down - maybe he didn't know it? But cmon F12 WIZ scores 10 extra points. That's a lot.
>Al_Pitzel: AEH D1 HA.E +40 182
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIMRV 5A VERDI. +38 286
#note 3rd turn in a row, I make the first play that stands out. To be fair I didn't exactly know the bingo MI(s)DRIVE, though.
>Al_Pitzel: MSU 1A MUS. +27 209
>Matthew_Larocque: ILMOORR A5 .IRL +21 307
#note I suppose now is as good a time as any to ruin the LINGUA hooks which I'm sure he is aware of. Sim says that (V)IOL is better too.
>Al_Pitzel: EEF F11 FEE +23 232
>Matthew_Larocque: ADMOOOR M6 .O.M +22 329
#note No way am I making plays off of FEE opening the TWS.
>Al_Pitzel: CIILY 11I ICILY +28 260
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGOORX G6 OX +37 366
>Al_Pitzel: DEITY 14F DEITY +33 293
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGNOR 3H ORGAND.E +72 438
#note I've known this word for a long time, but have never played it until now.
>Al_Pitzel: AINO 15H NAOI +25 318
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AHRTTV H1 TR.TH +27 465
#note I almost played (s)HAVeR instead for 36. I think TR(O)Ve makes sense because there's not a whole lot I can do with the V.
>Al_Pitzel: ABOPT 12M OBA +11 329
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AV 13K VAn +20 485
#note Well actually I did have VAs 15D which I missed, but Al decided to help me out here.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (PT) +8 493
#note didn't play perfect, but drew good enough that it didn't matter.
