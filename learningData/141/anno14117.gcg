>Matthew_Larocque: AEEKNRT 8H RETAKEN +82 82
>Ben_Settle: ABEIORT H4 ARBO.ITE +61 61
>Ben_Settle: ABEIORT --  -61 0
#note I actually wasn't positive this was bad, but I also don't see Ben play words like very often - so it did seem fishy.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIIILN 7E ILIAD +16 98
#note 9I NIDI was the play I was looking for.
>Ben_Settle: ABEIORT 8A ABORT +26 26
#note He's missing quite a few bingos here.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIJNOO 6H COJOIN +40 138
#note CO(IT)ION is a word I didn't know - meaning COITUS.
>Ben_Settle: EQU E5 QU..E +28 54
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLNOT N2 GLEET +34 172
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLNOT --  -34 138
#note Yeah, no. Didn't find ELONG(A)TE here. It's far and away the best play, as is usually the case with racks like these.
>Ben_Settle: IZ B8 .IZ +34 88
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLNOT 11A GENTLE +29 167
#note I guess playing for turnover is a good idea with what's still unseen.
>Ben_Settle: ?AEINTW 10F WANT +28 116
#note We deduced that this was his rack, but I don't get it. He said he saw TAWNIEr but he thought it didn't play? Yeah I don't know.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEOVY 12E ABOVE +24 191
#note Poor placement, 11I makes it nearly impossible to bingo. I just HAD to have 24 points instead of 22. >_<
>Ben_Settle: ?DEEIRW 13I REWIrED +75 191
>Matthew_Larocque: ACELOTY K11 CO.Y +24 215
#note I think I saw the bingo ACOLYTE and thought I was just making it up. Why don't I know ODYL?
>Ben_Settle: AEGU A11 .AUGE +24 215
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELSST 14A .ATeLESS +70 285
#note I did not know (E)LASTaSE or (G)ESTALtS, and I also thought (G)LASSiTE was a word.
>Ben_Settle: DH 9A H.D +19 234
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMPRSY 14J M. +23 308
#note I think this is the rack, but regardless this play blows. I know I played it really fast because Ben likes to blitz me when my time gets low.
>Ben_Settle: X 12K .X +36 270
>Matthew_Larocque: IILPRSY N10 PLI.R +26 334
#note Sim prefers PILIS for 36 or I(D)LY/I(D)YL.
>Ben_Settle: DFI 9K DIF +29 299
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIMOSY N2 OFAYS +44 378
>Ben_Settle: GIN M2 GIN +23 322
>Matthew_Larocque: IMNRRST 15L MIST +35 413
#note No point in fishing here.
>Ben_Settle: EOOPUUV 13C UP +15 337
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNRR 15H HE +30 443
#note Thought it would be easier to go out if I kept a vowel, saw RAN(I) next turn.
>Ben_Settle: EOOUV O9 OE +6 343
#note He could have played VE(NA) though!
>Matthew_Larocque: ANRR L3 RAN. +20 463
>Ben_Settle: OUV 5N .O +5 348
>Matthew_Larocque: R 2M ..R +4 467
#note Many better places but I didn't have time.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (UV) +10 477
#note Letting him play REWIrED was stupid, and missing ELONG(A)TE was a big mistake. But I hogged the esses which made it harder for him to score so it didn't matter.
