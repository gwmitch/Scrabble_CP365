>Will: ?HIMNOS K5 MON.fISH +114 150
#note W: Waffled for a while here, seeing this word quickly but having sudden doubt of its validity. In this spot you really need to be sure, since MONKISH leaving the blank is really strong, and there are many other bingos. I guess monkfish is a pretty common food - somehow wasn't aware of that.
>Rafi: EILOORS 9C ORIOLES +76 114
>Will: ABCEINY J4 BAY +33 183
#note W: I think ABYE is better here given my lead, but it's not a huge difference.
>Rafi: EEEGNUV L12 EVE +22 136
#note R: This was a tough decision for me. I was looking at UNREEVE, GUV/VEX, and VEG/GO (and didn't consider REVUE). The board was ripe for scoring opportunities, so while EVE does open up a juicy triple lane, it doesn't give up that much more than the board already has to offer. EVE is clearly the best equity play and gives me a hook, and the NG presents a moderate double-double possibility through the I. Against a weaker opponent, EVE might be a mistake as it leads to fewer opponent errors.
>Will: CEINRTW 15J WINCER +44 227
>Rafi: EGLNQUV F5 UNGL.VE +21 157
#note R: I was immediately drawn to figuring out whether it was worth going for QI/QAT, especially considering that there were 6 T's and 8 A's unseen. I didn't see VENULE however, which looks like an upgrade to my play, and simply playing QI itself is a pretty good option. The main problem with not playing QI is that with all those unseen T's, the spot will be taken relatively often.
>Will: EFHIINT J10 HIT +35 262
#note W: If it wasn't for the Q, FRITH might be so much better positionally than HIT (blocks the ORIOLES floaters, cripples the UNGLOVE hook) that it would be worth playing; I thought the Q threat and additional equity of HIT put it over the top.
>Rafi: DEEOOQR 5C ROQ.E +28 185
#note R: Maybe RODEO/UNGLOVED, as there are many A's, T's, and U's unseen. ROQUET is also a threat here, which doesn't help my comeback chances.
>Will: ADEFINP 12A PAINED +37 299
>Rafi: DDELOOP N10 POODL. +30 215
#note R: POOD over ROQUE is another good option. I don't think PLEOPOD is going to work ever.
>Will: AEFIILS H1 ALIFS +51 350
>Rafi: ADEJTTZ 4B TAJ +40 255
>Will: AEGINRT A8 RETA.ING +149 499
#note W: Pretty good 5 tile pull to EI.
>Rafi: ADESTWZ C11 W.Z +30 285
#note R: WALTZ or ADZE works too, but I have decent bingo chances after WIZ. WALTZED/WALTZ and ADZE win the sim.
>Will: BCFIOTU O8 CUIF +36 535
>Rafi: AADEEST 2E DEA.ATES +63 348
>Will: BEORTTU 14K B. +8 543
#note W: The intent here was to block GUANACO, but I also thought there were more threats than just that - I believe I misread the pool and thought DONGOLA/GONDOLA were possible as well. Blocking row 14 might still be worth doing, but only with a play like 14F TURBO that guarantees me outs next turn. Otherwise, I should just play up top.
