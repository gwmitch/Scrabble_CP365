>JeremyH: AOPRRST 8D PARROTS +74 74
#note okay, that's a good start.
>DaveK: IIKLORS J6 KI. +17 17
#note DK: With the S in hand, I like this better than SIK# to set up the front S hook.  Already down by a bingo, I want to keep it open.  Other plays block up lines.
>JeremyH: ABEEIJN F4 INJE.A +29 103
#note INJERA#.  the duck likes it.
>DaveK: EILORSY D8 .YROLISE +78 95
>DaveK: GGIIINW (challenge) +5 100
#note Nice bingo.  It is Collins only.  Worth checking for 5 points.
DK: One thing that I like about CSW is that it is much more consistent than TWL about almost all verbs taking both the -ISE and -IZE spellings.  PYROLIZE is good in TWL, but this is not.
>JeremyH: BEEISSX C11 SEX +42 145
#note after 1000 iterations, SEX is 1.3 back of C12 EX.  It is tight between that, C13 XI, E10 EX, and my play.  I considered 15D (E)XIES# to kill the row 15 tws threat, but decided against it.
>DaveK: GGIIINW 5A WINGI.G +24 124
#note DK: A play like WIG B10 is usually not bad, despite the double I's, because of the strength of the -ING combo.  However, with the E on row 15 still exposed, I like my play better to aggressively open another scoring front, so that if he hits one triple lane, I can hit the other.
>JeremyH: BEIOSTU A5 .OUBIT +33 178
#note I was afraid I missed a Collins bingo in this, but A5 WOUBIT# is very correct.
>DaveK: EHINOUY D1 YOUN. +26 150
#note DK: Again, I am aggressively playing the leave and the board, not just the score.  I saw HOYS 14A, of course, which is static evaluator's favorite move.  It scores well and partially blocks the dangerous lane at the bottom.  But this early in the game, with the blanks still out and several bingo lines, I don't like having to draw to EINU.  I didn't think of UEYS 14A, which looks like a better way to play in the same spot, but I think this play is good too.  I get rid of my two biggest problem tiles, the Y and the U, while continuing to keep the board dynamic.
>JeremyH: ?BELRSW 12B B..LoWERS +64 242
#note I spotted 2B BR(O)WLEsS, but was unsure it would stick.  I picked one I was more sure of.  Unfortunately there are no bingos that kill row 15, so I don't feel so bad about leaving that open.  After BELLoWERS I am over 87% to win according to the duck, but maybe that should be a little lower given the dangerous row 15 and row 1 threats.
>DaveK: ?CEHIRT 15A HER.TICs +158 308
#note So much for my lead, but I'm still in this game if I can keep up this pace.
DK: The only other triple-triple is the fancy TELECHIR#
>JeremyH: AADEFLO 1A FLA.ED +39 281
#note 1A OFA(Y) sims 1.6 better, keeping bingo tiles.  In retrospect, playing long with FLAYED is weak keeping OA as a leave because all the goodies (S and ?) have been played.  The pro is potentially drawing QU for 14D (S)UQ.
>DaveK: DIMNNOU 11H MOUND +24 332
#note DK: Nothing else looks close here.  If I were trailing by a lot, I might want to hang onto the U for SUQ 14D, but in the lead I want to turn over tiles and end the game as quickly as possible.
>JeremyH: AAFOORV K3 FAVA +26 307
#note 10H AVO sims 3.3 better, again for it's improved leave.  I'm looking at FAVA for 2 reasons.  Monster plays like L1 QUOD or ZOEA could happen if I draw into them.  It makes it tempting for Dave to open the board for me to get points.
>DaveK: ADEINQT 4H QAN.T +48 380
#note DK: Again, QI F14 keeping the strong bingo leave would be an excellent play if I were behind.  But while ahead turn over tiles and take the points.
>JeremyH: ACNOORZ L8 ZON.A +50 357
#note I really liked this play because Dave will be hesitant about playing off that Z at the risk of opening a bingo lane because I threaten to bingo back.  If he leaves it, I can cash that Z twice and open a bingo line.  Even better, it preserves a second bingo line at 14H.
>DaveK: ADDEEIP 10J PI.ED +31 411
#note DK: Jeremy's reasoning on ZONDA# is exactly right.  Playing 8L-O would help him open the board.  As it turned out, I didn't have a play there.  My best play here looks like APES 14A, but I wasn't sure enough of SEXER#.  My play is not bad, but if I'd thought enough about the remaining tile distribution, I would have seen that PENED# in the same spot is better, since there are four E's and only one I unseen.  In fact, it would have given me MALEDICT on the following turn.
>JeremyH: ACIORUV 8L .OIC +45 402
#note 8L ZOIC sims best, but the chances of me winning are just 12% according to a many ply sim.
>DaveK: ADEELMT C1 .DME. +29 440
#note DK: Again, all my best plays involve SEXER#, but this is the best play that does not.  The key is that I want to score well but leave one tile in the bag to make the endgame as difficult as possible for Jeremy.
>JeremyH: AEGORUV 3K .AUVE +24 426
#note Done in by lack of Collins knowledge, I have a winning play right here that I didn't know.  14H OUVRAGE# 89 pts. wins the game.  EVERY other play loses.  What a shame.  Incentive to study more.
>DaveK: AEEELTT 14A ET +13 453
#note 14A ATE(S).  SEXER# is a word.
DK: I was getting short of time here, though not quite as short as Jeremy.  I didn't have time to work the endgame out perfectly, but the important thing is to work out a clear and simple winning line and not panic.  You don't have to be perfect, just good enough.  My choice leaves both ELATE 2F and DELATE N10 for 14 point out plays.  Obviously I would have played TES# in the same spot if I were sure of SEXER#.
>JeremyH: GHOR O1 HO.R +24 450
#note Missed 2 spread points on 13F HOG.  Scores the same but keeps an R (-2 rather than -4)
>DaveK: AEELT 2F ELATE +14 467
>DaveK:  (G) +4 471
