>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEILO H4 DArIOLE +68 68
#note Lucky start. I start after drawing a blank and then draw it again. DIAZOLE is best here.
>Joel_Wapnick: GISVW 11E VIGS +24 24
#note Interesting that he chose the V over the W (he switched), but in turns out to work in his favor.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGIKPX G5 PAX +42 110
#note PICKAX is cool, same amount of points and same leave valuation for GICK as for AG, but PAX is way better defensively. 
>Joel_Wapnick: OWY I3 YOW +24 48
>Joshua_Sokol: CDGIKOR J2 COG +22 132
#note Terrible play here. I quickly looked for -ROCK words such as GLIDROCK* and missed GRID(L)OCK. I also used my C in COG instead of my D for DOG, which is second best.
>Joel_Wapnick: BO F10 B.O +11 59
>Joshua_Sokol: DGIJKRU 13C DRUG +19 151
#note I took a while here because I knew JUG or DRUG were close. I was also really considering J(AR) since I would have KLUDGIER if I drew an E, but I decided against it. I also decided to keep the J since it's not terrible at this point. Both DRUG and JUG effectively blocked him, so I think it's really a coin toss.
>Joel_Wapnick: EMO 7F O..ME +17 76
#note Well whaddyknow, keeping the J really worked for me...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIJKW F6 J.W +54 205
#note Type a note here!AJAR... the only good reason to play JOW is to block a lucky triple play underneath JO.
>Joel_Wapnick: AEIRSTT K5 TASTIER +93 169
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAEEIK J6 K.A +35 240
#note Boy would the Z have been nice here... I chose the safest, highest scoring play. I just don't want to screw up here...
>Joel_Wapnick: AHH J10 HAH +32 201
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEIIU -AEIIU +0 240
#note Best, surprisingly.
>Joel_Wapnick: EEMNS 14B NEEMS +37 238
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELLRS 10J ..LL +7 247
#note Remarkable that he just came back after that deficit. Now I'm scared because I'm not 100% with LADLERS. What a mistake it was not playing it. Also, HELD is better, as I suspected. Much better seeing Joel's next play.
>Joel_Wapnick: ACENOPT M3 CONEPAT. +82 320
#note Ugh...
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEERSU 15A RUED +33 280
#note And my fish failed...
>Joel_Wapnick: BIN L4 BIN +29 349
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFIQRS 13I FAQIR +52 332
#note Now I'm starting to suspect he has the other blank...
>Joel_Wapnick: E 12I E. +10 359
#note I don't understand this play, but there isn't much to do on this board now without opening up, so either he has the blank or he suspects me of having it.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENOSZ E3 ZOEA +36 368
#note I'm now just hoping to outscore, and after his last play I can't play (A)ZO. This wins most of the time apparently...
>Joel_Wapnick: FI 3C FI. +30 389
#note But then again so does this.
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNSTY L12 Y.N +12 380
#note Well as I generate the choices for this play I kind of like (L)EN(I)TY 10L. I was wrestling with (A)NY which I decided against since Joel's word knowledge would probably lead him to bingoing here, as I'm almost certain he has the blank at this point. I played Y(I)N hoping he couldn't find something with the blank S in 6th, 5th of 4th position. Though he will probably block with QI next turn or even play for points with the blank, I can still hope. And apparenly it was best by a lot.
>Joel_Wapnick: I 14K I. +13 402
#note Yup, I should maybe start figuring that he might not have it yet, but I'm too paranoid.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENSTU C3 .EU +6 386
#note Bad draw, or so I thought, as this play kind of screws him over. I was thinking that he would bingo and that I could hopefully bingo back and win.
>Joel_Wapnick: DINOV 8D VO. +13 415
#note Well, he didn't have the blank, as I drew it after (F)EU. here he had either VO(W) which wins 20% of the time with my next play, INDO(W) (which he decided against because I might have had  good move with the blank as a W) that wins most of the time, N(U) for two, which I think is his surest win, since our times were running out, unless I forked him with another opening play and hoped for a G bingo.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENSTT B5 NEATeST +62 448
#note NATTErS is a much surer win.
>Joel_Wapnick: DIILNTU A7 NIDI +27 442
#note Also, in the spur of the moment, I played NEATEST over NOTATES because I thought he had the Z, which I then remembered was already on the board...
>Joshua_Sokol: ERR 8M .RE +9 457
#note I mistracked and didn't know his tiles, but the board was closed enough that I think I had a sure win. (HELL)ER, which I didn't know, is best here.
>Joel_Wapnick: LTU O5 LUT. +4 446
#note What a lucky win this was. Joel really put up a fight.
>Joel_Wapnick:  (R) +2 448
