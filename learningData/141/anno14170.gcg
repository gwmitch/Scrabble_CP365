#note Keeping the D here would be fine too, maybe even better. Tacking it on it is a little safer, which suited me just fine.

#note Glad to see the sim results agree with my intuition that DRAINER would yield the least scoring opportunities for Lisa.

#note 1H ETH is an option, but the pool seemed unthreatening and JETON still blocks a lot of the bingos that fit on row 1 to begin with. Opp. bingo percentage is equal between ETH and JETON.

#note After briefly considering SCREAMY* because it would have been a total disaster if I were wrong about it not being a word, I felt OK making this fun play.
>Lisa: BBORSTU A8 BURBOTS +100 416
>Lisa: BBORSTU --  -100 316
#note Lisa is also highly dubious of SCREAMY* but quite reasonably figures it's worth a shot.
