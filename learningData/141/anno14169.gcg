#note Aargh, felt terrible for Mack here...fortunately I caught this and realized what had happened right before he drew tiles. The way this kid keeps his composure through anything is really incredible.

#note Look at that pool. Holding the case E and S, I liked my chances of at the very least hitting a heavy scoring play hooking GIB next turn. Still, at this point my chances of a blowout big enough to catch Stefan if he wins a very close game are essentially dead, so I had to hope for Evans to beat him.

#note Quite the streak, mostly luck-fueled, to finish the tourney off - but Stefan triumphed in his last game to go back-to-back in Premier, an amazing feat. Congrats to him!
