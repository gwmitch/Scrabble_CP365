#note czar sims better than jar on 2-ply, and I'm not surprised - this play doesn't block the Z and gives back another hotspot at 2B. but I figured that I had to get at least one power tile out of the way to allow myself to bingo in the not-so-distant future. the long-term prospects for IJQR look dubious. regardless of how I tweak the sim I cannot get quackle to agree with me.
