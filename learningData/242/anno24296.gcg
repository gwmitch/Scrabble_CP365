#note maybe GE(R)AH here, but EMT doesn't seem too much better than M on this board. CENTUM serves as a nice bingo lane, doesn't often get blocked which makes GERAH's leave slightly stronger. Bingo percentage goes from 14 to 28 from thenage to gerah. Q puts this 3 down.

#note all the leaves here are uninspiring, but at least this sets up the Q! and QT had the added value of QAT.

#note the shorter plays are uninspiring - (L)I(E)VE doesn't set up an amazing scoring spot, but works with his leave surely better than mine. Exchanging here is probably fine.

#note I need to score here and hit a high scoring bingo, or two bingoes. EEIS isn't good now, but the FROM/PROM setup is hard to block. I also wanted to leave 8a alone, to make a 5 tile opening there later (so no ADO plays).
