#description Steve Bush plays Joshua Sokol in Round 5 at the 2016 NSC
>Steve: EILNNTY 8G LINNEY +26 26
#note Josh: My first ever game at board 1! I was super nervous, so I took 10 minutes to chill out with some music before the game.
>Joshua: FINORTU H3 FRUIT.ON +62 62
#note I chose this FRUITION cause I thought it would give less back than the other FRUITION, which left two 3 2x2s open. I also thought I could control the board better with this placement, but I don't know about that thought anymore. I can't do much about the bottom, in reality. Meh, either way I can't do much. 
>Steve: DNNOOTX K8 .XON +22 48
#note Josh: Even thought the leave is garbagy, 6D TOXO(I)D makes the most sense here.
>Joshua: KLNORRU L3 KNURL. +26 88
>Steve: DEELNOT 6C DELET.ON +63 111
>Joshua: EEIIOOR L11 OORIE +14 102
#note My first embarrassment of my short trip to board 1: missing J4 IO(N)O(N)E. :(
>Steve: BDFIRTW 15K B.FIT +30 141
>Joshua: DEIQUVW 13I QUI.ED +52 154
>Steve: DERRSWY D4 WE.DY +32 173
>Joshua: AERSVWZ 8A WAV. +39 193
#note What a lucky break for me those past two turns. Leaving SEZ/SQUIRED in my arsenal for next turn, or worse, a bingo.
>Steve: AHIMRRS J8 .AH +36 209
>Joshua: EEORSSZ H13 SEZ +53 246
>Steve: IJMORRS 5K J.ROR +24 233
#note That elusive new 4 escapes even the best of us, Steve. Definitely correct to play N10 JIR(D) here.
>Joshua: AEEORST 13G E....... +19 265
#note I really had no idea if I had missed something here. But I needed to play O4 O(R)ATE, even though most would disagree. I had a bad feeling about what was to come. Besides that feeling, my play is probably best, bingo-ing on average 85% of the time next turn. As long as I don't draw another E for another unplayable ROSEATE...
>Steve: ?AGIMST O2 SMA.TInG +83 316
#note So insanely lucky that Steve didn't come up with TRIGRAMS or MISGRAFT here. Wow. 
>Joshua: AEGORST 11B GAROTES +78 343
>Steve: ACEEHIO C2 HAO +17 333
#note Steve feels he is far behind here, as he is (this was definitely a poor draw). But he can tough it out without making a desperate C setup, that is almost certain to get blocked, or worse, used. 7A AHE(D) or OHE(D) are interesting, but I prefer 3J HA(K)EE(M) for 30, bringing him ahead.
>Joshua: ?ACDMPP B1 CAMP +42 385
#note This was a horrendous play that merited instant karma. I saw C(HAO) as a possibility, but didn't realize there was another C out. So I proceed to not really block the spot at all, but rather make it nearly impossible to block later. He could hit any _CC_____ word and come right back into the game, or worse, triple-triple. Fortunately the only available bingo there is E(C)CLESIA. At least I didn't play PAMP*, which I considered to be valid. DAMP is definitely safer.
>Steve: CEEIISU N1 CUE +18 351
#note Things are increasingly grim for Steve, so he decides to open another threat up, hoping to hit one of two spots on the board. His best shot is probably to go for ECCLESIA, amazingly, with a two-turn fish or 2N I(S)+ a U fish next turn. He also can hit SOLECI(Z)E on the second turn if he draws the blank.
>Joshua: ?ABDGPT J12 B.G +10 395
#note I have the game in the bag, just trying to go for spread. Looked like I hit more stuff with the P than with the B to the E. In reality,10 things play with the P, and 8 with the B. Yahoo.
>Steve: AEEIILS D11 .EI +6 357
>Joshua: ?AADPTV I1 aVA +12 407
#note This was just hilarious. I missed that he could play LI(a)ISE. I thought this was a cute out-in two, which it is. But...
>Steve: AEIILS 1G LI.ISE +18 375
#note Steve can go out with LIAISE(D) at N7!!! Wow! We both missed that. My best play was to play VAT at M9, to set up PAID for a bunch if he doesn't block. In the end, this was one point better than VAT.
>Joshua: ADPT C11 .DAPT +23 430
>Joshua:  (A) +2 432
