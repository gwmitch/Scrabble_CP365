#note Multiple misses here despite spending plenty of time looking. First, I forgot about (SOCK)O, so I miss my spot for cUPOLAS and UPLOAdS. Second, I totally missed sPOUSAL which is easy to play on this board. Third, I saw ScOPULA but thought that ACLOPSU only made two bingos, CUPOLAS and COPULAS. Fourth, I missed two eights, POU(N)dALS and OUtL(E)APS. Fifth, there is no fifth reason but just so everybody knows, I really screwed up on this turn.

#note I don't think RESAY is correct here since I will likely draw garbage (there's only one vowel in the bag) and probably won't be able to make up twenty points. Bingoing is the only option. If Fern doesn't have the A, she simply can't block the S hook on ANOINTER, so that's good news for me. Quackle thinks N13 YU(M) is a little better, but that restricts column O slightly. AEDRSU bingos with LNNN in the pool, and drawing the Q might also win some of the time.

#note Was running out of time here - U(M) gives be the best shot, bingoing with NNNR or 4/10 remaining tiles. This fares much, much worse, but I didn't have time to figure out exactly what it bingos with (AR, LN, NN, and NT draws, it turns out). I thought I needed to score points here AND bingo, but maybe I don't need to - maybe bingoing by itself will be good enough.
