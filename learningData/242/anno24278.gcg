#note Or I could play short with LAW. Not as big a mistake as MEINY vs. YUM out of EIMNSUY, if this is even a mistake at all.

#note Struggled with this turn since there are no standout plays. Considered L1 FLEER but was wary of putting the F there. This does nothing for the board and the leave is somewhat ugly, so it's probably not correct. Maybe N6 FE(E)BLER, which I didn't see over the board.

#note Another turn where there are no standout choices. Except for 8A AMOEBE(AN) which is the clear best play.

#note Worth the two point sacrifice to play uNAWARE?

#note STa(N)NOUS would have been bad. Special side note: Darrell wouldn't be bingoing on row 1 if I had played uNAWARE.

#note M8 (C)OLD(L)Y is nice.
