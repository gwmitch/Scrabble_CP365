>Max_Panitch: CHITY 8H ITCHY +34 34
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEFGRR I3 REGiF.ER +67 67
#note G6 REFoRGE. Wasn't quite sure enough of FITCHY.
>Max_Panitch: BDDOTU 4D DOUBT.D +24 58
>Charles_Reinke: FIMORRT 5C FORM +29 96
#note As I typed my rack into Quackle I immediately knew I missed TRIFORM. I did see R(O)TIFORM but, again, wasn't sure. Good start so far.
>Max_Panitch: ACP 6D CAP +35 93
>Charles_Reinke: AILRSTT 11I STARLIT +76 172
#note I should play it at G7...I guess I need to review my ITCHY hooks.
>Max_Panitch: Q N10 Q. +31 124
>Charles_Reinke: AEINNUV O8 UNI. +23 195
#note Or UNI(T)E for six more, but that creates an S hook on a board that doesn't have any.
>Max_Panitch: ENOOY 5I .OONEY +23 147
>Charles_Reinke: AEIMNOV L1 VIME. +28 223
#note L4 E(N)VO(Y) looks to be better. Tough play to find.
>Max_Panitch: AX M3 AX. +37 184
>Charles_Reinke: AAJNOOS 1J NO.A +7 230
#note I wanted to block the V so bad. This does that, but actually sets up some triple-triple possibilities like RE(NOVA)TE and IN(NOVA)TE! Max pointed it out after the game - good thing he didn't manage to play one. Anyway, Quackle likes O1 ANOAS. I wanted to save my J to aim for a higher-scoring play there next turn.
>Max_Panitch: AH 3F HA +22 206
>Charles_Reinke: ADJNOSS 2G JO +21 251
#note I could play O1 SOJAS but now I'm hoarding my S for no reason. At least this blocks those triple-triples.
>Max_Panitch: EIRZ O8 ....IZER +54 260
#note Held for a while because I really didn't want it to be good.

>Charles_Reinke: ?BPSSUW 6H W.SP +20 337
#note Trying to save B(ITCHY) for bingoing purposes. But I should just play PUB at G8 to set up an easy S hook since I have the last S and blank.
