>Jackson_Smylie: EEFIOYZ H7 FOZY +38 38
#note cuts off his options a bit, and I want a closed board against Mark

>Jackson_Smylie: DEEGIKM 7J KEG +19 140
#note missed KNOB, but kedge is not something I"m playing anyways. also didn't know MEDICK. seems pretty standard here
>Menachem_Rosenberg: DFINRST K1 DRIFTN..S +76 129
#note neither of us knew DONATIVES, so luckily it got closed for huge plays next turn
>Jackson_Smylie: DDEIMMW 1F DIMME. +36 176
>Menachem_Rosenberg: ACNNOTT N5 COT.NANT +64 193
#note why I want a closed board against mark...
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEELPW 2B PAWLED +36 212
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEELPW --  -36 176
#note AWED or DRAWL or LEAPED are fine. even WAILED. I wasn't sure of PAWLED*, as I wasn't sure it wasn't just LAPWING. silly to attempt a phony against mark! game would have been very different if I hadn't done this.
>Menachem_Rosenberg: ?AEOPSY 13H tEAPOYS +85 278
#note POSEY is 82! 
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEELPW 14J WADE +41 217
#note wasn't a fan of this because of how easy it is to score here, but I'm hoping his 7 random tiles are all vowels or all consonants, and he leaves the spot.
>Menachem_Rosenberg: AELORSU 5E ROSULA.E +66 344
>Jackson_Smylie: BELOPWX 12J WOP +42 259
#note sims best - I was really happy with this play, cause it sets up my L and leaves the X for the sneaky 6f OXO spot!!!! this actually gave me a lot of hope
>Menachem_Rosenberg: IILNRST B5 NITRILS +67 411
#note confused that he didn't play this with WAWS or WAWL. He takes a long time to find bingoes and plays it seems, so maybe he struggles with board vision (haven't asked him, but it seems like that). hoping he missed WAW hooks later...
>Jackson_Smylie: BELOTUX 6D BOX +59 318
#note missing the superior BRUX! BOX has a bit of merit cause a Q draw is good here.
>Menachem_Rosenberg: AAI 8A A.IA +15 426
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EELRTU 9H .EE. +24 342
#note missed mUR(R)ELET 2H. I saw LEcTURE 14b but decided against it cause I don't really win. maybe play RETIcULE and hope to draw haverel or something... idk... hoping for an -L bingo, and that he has junk. 
>Menachem_Rosenberg: AILQU 15F QUAIL +52 478
