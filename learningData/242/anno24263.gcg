>Avery_Mojica: GIPRSTU H3 UPGIRTS +76 76
>Avery_Mojica: GIPRSTU --  -76 0
#note A: Had it not been game 7 of the day and if I had spent more than 10 seconds for this play, I'd realize how stupid this was.
C: Thanks to Avery for providing racks and commentary. I had to think for a little while on this one.
>Charles_Reinke: ABHNNSS -BHNS +0 0
#note C: I can't give Avery an N or an H for his bingos, so it's either exchange or play SAB. The choice is clear.
>Avery_Mojica: GIPRSTU H7 PUG +12 12
#note A: Now that I'm not even sure if UPGIRT is valid, I opted to play short. This is fine though.

>Charles_Reinke: GIKLOPU J3 GOPIK +23 110
>Avery_Mojica: ?EEIOUX K4 XI +35 156
#note A: God, I really have no idea what to do here. I know this gives away so many cheap points and keeps 4 (!) vowels, but a play like 14I EXCUSE, EXPOSE or EXCISE (I saw all but EXCISE) gives away cheap points too, and that burns the blank and keeps OI, which doesn't seem like a wise idea. Another option I did not consider was the simpler 5H EXPO, but it seems like a bad idea to keep 3 vowels and score less than I would with the other options. A sim puts XI ahead by about 2 points, but I never know how to gauge a sim's accuracy. Definitely open to thoughts here - turns like this are tough for me.
>Charles_Reinke: AEILOUZ L3 ZOEA +51 161
>Avery_Mojica: ?EEMOTU 8L ..ME +27 183
#note A: Debated between FEME and MOUSE for a while. Mack says MOUSE. I agree. A sim puts FEME ahead by FIVE points and 2.5% win chances. Not sure I can agree there - open to thoughts here also. I think my in-game thinking followed the line of thought of "oh, I'm keeping OUT and opening a new lane. Great!" Game 7 of every nationals makes me feel drunken.
>Charles_Reinke: AEILLUW -AILUW +0 161
#note C: Spent a long, long time on this play. I can play LEA, LA, (Z)ILL, or (Z)EAL for decent scores, but keeping bad leaves and opening up significant hotspots. My only play to dump UW is WAUL(S) for 10 and that gives easy access to a TWS. I didn't like any of those options so I exchanged. LWEI(S) sims best; this is a few points down.
>Avery_Mojica: ?CEORTU 14G fRUCTO.E +80 263
#note A: Charles spending like 8 minutes to exchange 5 really threw me off, and I also spent a very long time looking to the E I had just set up. OUTCURSE, which I was not sure of, is the only other option that scores this much. Neither that or FRUCTOSE would have prevented his bingo though.
>Charles_Reinke: ABELNOT 15A NOTABLE +81 242
>Avery_Mojica: ADEINRU 3L .EDA +28 291
#note A: Here's where I blew up and had no focus and no idea on a good play. Racks like these gave me so much trouble - no bingo plays, and I don't want to blow up the board too much and ruin a good rack. But I couldn't seem to figure out how to score and keep a leave with synergy. So I made this crappy play. Static has it listed as one of its choices, and CP says just to play ZA, which doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me. A sim says all my plays offer between 7-12% bingo chances next turn, with C12 DAUT at about 12.5%. Really unclear here.
>Charles_Reinke: DIIOORW O1 WO.D +30 272
>Avery_Mojica: EINRSTU C8 RUNTIES. +68 359
#note A: It's always good getting bailed out for your mistakes.
>Charles_Reinke: CEEIIOR 8A OR.ICE +27 299
>Avery_Mojica: AMOOQUW D4 MAQU. +32 391
#note A: Ack, UMIAQ bites me again. CP picks UMIAQ by a good margin with this in second. Could have been a costly mistake.
>Charles_Reinke: ?BEGIIL B1 BLInGIE. +74 373
#note C: I knew this was phony, but with the addition of BLINGED+, and the fact that Avery risks losing the game if he challenges and it's acceptable, I was confident it would stay on. I probably would have played my real bingos (ELIGIBl(E), ExIGIBL(E)) had I seen them.
>Avery_Mojica: DEIJOOW E1 JOWED +42 433
#note A: Had it been earlier in the tournament, I would have challenged this confidently. But after having screwed up my opening play, wasted lots of time on silly plays, and suffered lots of game 7 fatigue, I was in no position to challenge this confidently. If I was to take it off, I saw ELIGIBLE as a possible response, and that JOWED was sure to give cheap fish points back for JIBE. JOWED is almost positively going to get blocked for lots of points, since both H's and Y's are out. CP says JOWED is the only play to win 100% of the time, even after he hits the triple with something like JEHAD, which I can probably accredit to keeping OI in a very consonant-heavy bag. Challenging it off is still correct though, but I salvaged myself a bit.
>Charles_Reinke: DEFHRYY F2 YEH +43 416
>Avery_Mojica: AAILNOV E8 .OVIN +20 453
#note A: He was low on time and almost positively not going to block my good out. CP says this is the best endgame.
