#note Absolutely wrong, I must play IKON here, or if I'm feeling like not playing IKON I need to play YOGIN. At least this time I realized my brainless move was bad pretty shortly after hitting my clock, unlike a lot of others where I didn't realize it until postgame analysis.

#note Just fishing an O scores the same and bingos more, though I liked also blocking the E and I. I wonder what moron put the E and I out in space there like that? Quackle prefers VIRIONS, which looks nice to burn 6 to ?? and score even better.
>Rafi: AEEHIMU 11K HAME +30 214
>Will: ?AORSXY 13K ORYX +37 276
#note B12 OXY to keep the R bumps my bingo% from 55 to 70+. Sloppy last few turns.
>Rafi: BBEITUV F5 BUB +13 227
>Will: ?AAEFIS B3 SAFArIE. +67 343
#note SAFARIED yields more points and more bingos than FASCIAE, which I saw. I balked at making a strong sevens line with FASCIAE 2E, but I don't think I considered moving FASCIAE over to 2D for two fewer points, preventing a bingo from going down on the top row. That's a good play.
>Rafi: EILOQTV 8A Q. +33 260
>Will: ALNPRRS E3 PLAN +22 365
#note Might be better to just score 36 here and outrun?
>Rafi: EGILOTV C1 VLOG +23 283
#note Awesome play by Rafi here. Only thing with real chances. If he draws vowel-blank I'm in a major bind.

#note It's so frustrating to see myself make the same brain dead types of mistakes over and over again. Sometimes the tiles bail me out but other times I get what I deserve.
