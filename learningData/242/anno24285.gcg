#note 14F KUDO
CP is indicating my chances of winning are welll under 1% regardless, but I didn't see any point in closing a lane without opening a new one quite yet.   I'm still thinking miracle-comeback.

#note I was pretty sure BEZEL was only a noun, but if I'm going to make a move, now is the tme.   It leaves me far enough behind that maybe she won't risk the challenge. but me close enough to be able to imagine a winning board for myself.
