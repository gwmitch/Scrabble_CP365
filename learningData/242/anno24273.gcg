#note Quackle wants me to play off my S: 11H SPRAG or 11E GRASP. 28 vs 18 points, but the GPS leave actually isn't very good.

#note Nothing to do about the 3x3 line unless I want to play JAP(E).

>Charles_Reinke: ACDEIQS I1 QI +18 143
#note 11D QADIS/QAIDS sim a lot better. Probably because there are no letters for me to work with to make eights, and there's only one lame S hook.

#note This was part of my "ingenious" plan to start shutting down the board with both blanks in the bag. I saw I7 LOMEIN but didn't realize that it scored a full ten more points than my play.

#note This is the second time this Nationals that TOS* has been played and I failed to notice! If I can challenge here I suddenly become a big favorite to win, since Paul probably doesn't have the blank here. 
>Charles_Reinke: DIILNNS 8J L.NINS +21 330
#note Quackle says this wins 68% of the time. I'm telling everybody that so that they can feel sympathy for me. I want sympathy. Please give it to me. I crave it.

#note Two one-point losses in the span of four games, both because I massively screwed up the endgame.
