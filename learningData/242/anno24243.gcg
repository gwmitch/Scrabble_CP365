#description Joshua Sokol plays Paul Epstein in Round 7 at the 2016 NSC
>Joshua: IMNTTUU 8G TUTU +8 8
#note After suffering that embarrassing loss last game, I am definitely ready to embarrass myself once more. The question is, will Paul call me on it?
>Paul: BDEEEOR 7E OBE +9 9
#note Ooh, we have an aggressive player here! Fasten your seatbelts, this is going to be a bumpy ride!
>Joshua: ?IIMNRS K2 MIRINgS +71 79
#note This is not a word. I was certain it was. I must have been thinking of MILINGS! Incredibly, Paul doesn't even hold. INFIRMS is my best score at D3. I missed that, for some reason. Shaky!
>Paul: DDEEIOR 8A DIODE +29 38
>Joshua: EILNNTW C7 T.WLINE +30 109
>Paul: EERRSUV A5 VER.URES +63 101
#note NERVURES at 12C was Paul's play
>Joshua: AEGGLNT 3F LEGAT.NG +74 183
>Paul: AENPSTW 2A STEWPAN +84 185
>Joshua: ?BEILOR 1F BOIL +26 209
#note I thought I was drawing the bag, seems we both were! Blanks or no blanks, two bingos in a row are tough to compete against! I considered that I could possibly underlap LEGATING with a weird 7, but did not see that weird 7. That weird 7 is CORBEIL. Everything else scored only 60 and didn't accomplish much, so I decided to forego the bingos. L(A)BORI(T)Es is cool to block big scores on this triple I was keen on defending, though.
>Paul: AAACDGO 6E DAGO +22 207
>Joshua: ?AEEJRZ L1 JA.E +46 255
#note What a crazy good draw. Are you kidding me?
>Paul: AACHIRY D12 ARCH +32 239
#note B12 AYAH is a good counter to the J I just put up there for all to access.
>Joshua: ?AAERUZ 15D .AZER +51 306
#note Finally had an interesting decision on my hands. Do I take care of the J, or do I take care of the H? I'm most worried about a big bingo, as I can withstand a J play, so I favoured HAZER to score now and bingo in a turn or 2, but (J)URA is interesting as well, since the AZE? combo is killer for bingos and for scoring on future turns. Much more flexible than AU. Ultimately, though, I chose to play here because Paul still might not be able to utilize the J this coming turn, since he has played 4 tiles off after seemingly not being able to hit the J last turn. 
>Paul: AIIOOXY 1L .IAO +33 272
>Joshua: ?AFLNOU 14G mOANFUL +64 370
#note Whew! Timely draw of a bingo that I saw...
>Paul: CIIOSXY 2N XI +38 310
#note 15M OXY must be Paul's play here. It scores more, bingos more, and blocks a spot that I could end the game with, as well as blocking the biggest Q spot on the board.
>Joshua: EEFIKOR 4C FORK +32 402
#note Apparently I should just keep the K to score with later, and play off fewer tiles. I decided I should outrun as many things as possible, but Quackle thinks I'm best off keeping a more balanced leave, even with all of these clunkers left. I guess I see it.
>Paul: ACINOSY E11 OY +16 326
#note I13 Y(A)S is Paul's best shot here. Creates a lane, but most of all scores.
>Joshua: EEHIMQY J5 QI +28 430
#note Stupidly missing that he gave me a better spot, when the game is already won. Still, this should have cost me a lot of spread
>Paul: ACEINSV 15L NAVE +29 355
#note Unfortunate that the P was in the bag, costing Paul 22 points in one turn for not having drawn it.
>Joshua: DEEHMTY 10E THYMED +33 463
#note And here, I figured this was probably not a word, but that the game was won, so why not try it? Greediness succeeeds sometimes.
>Paul: CIPS O11 SPIC. +12 367
>Paul:  (E) +2 369
#note And thus concludes my embarrassing trip to board 1. Fortunately for me, play did not seem to steeply improve later on in the tournament! Hopefully I didn't set a bad precedent...
