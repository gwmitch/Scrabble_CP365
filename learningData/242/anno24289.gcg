#note the valuation of TELIA isn't much worst than OWT, and gives a few floaters for bingoes. TELIA is definitely the play, and a fish like TA/UTE is surely better. Even TA/OWT I'd think is better. I don't need this entropy here.

>Jackson_Smylie: AADOORT L4 ADO. +10 144
#note I was really unhappy with this play, so I should not have made it. He knocked over an S on his rack, so I was intent on not letting him have any S potential - but the OWTS hook isn't even that strong here - ADO/AMU is still probably better, or even TOADY or TARDO, which I also considered. Overparanoid here.... If I had asked myself "what does he average after each of these plays?" I would surely have shied away from this 10 point play.
>Dave_Leifer: BORSW C2 BROWS +34 195
>Jackson_Smylie: AAORTTV E11 AVO +22 166
#note I think OTTAVA is better here cause ARTT doesn't do that well on this board (8a plays can be alright, but nothing special and no bingo potential). OTTAVA reaches for good scoring tiles (K is good here), and the ?SS. Q prefers it. If OVA could at least hold a T for MUTE that would be okay but it blocks it.
>Dave_Leifer: BDENR K6 B.NDER +22 217
>Jackson_Smylie: ADRSTTY M3 TRAY +27 193
#note could have considered a lot more plays here... DAY F2, TODAY 4B, ARTSY. I liked what TRAY did to the board, and the S hook it creates with stray can be a scoring spot for me. FOIST gets me back in the game.
>Dave_Leifer: GGIJ 8A JIGG. +45 262
>Jackson_Smylie: ADIKOST F2 KA +41 234
#note DIOST inspired me a lot more here. maybe I am being greedy in hopes to bingo, but DIOST seemed to have more potential anyways. I'm not sure! Q likes KAT by a few

>Jackson_Smylie: EEFLNOO O12 FLOE +42 349
#note Q likes floe and fool best, naturally. I don't know what my shots here are (champ says 30%? seems a bit high). He has the Z half the time, which seems like a pretty bad case. Though whoever draws the Q will be at a big disadvantage. I was sort of hoping for an S draw and Dave to have the Q. Obviously ZEIN plays kill, but I Can't block it anyways cause he has other stuff often as well.
