#note The only reasonable non-exchange is 6K (L)ABIA. With plenty of A's and I's unseen, there's no reason to keep either at this point.

#note 1G WUD was my obvious first thought, but then I became worried about TWS plays with the X. I could just do E(X)TRA now and deal with the DUW leave later (assuming that 1G gets blocked). Either way this is probably a mistake.
>Jason_Keller: AY 11J .AY +29 349
>Charles_Reinke: ABIIOTU 12A TIBIA +21 385
#note I saw 1G BOUT, but somehow not OBIA, which is clearly the best play here. Playing at 1G is imperative to make sure Jason doesn't score big with the Z. Another significant late-game mistake.

#note This is where it gets bad. Given that I have the score at 386-388, this play wins by one (assuming Jason sees his monster out of (MO)ULTER). I saw 15L VISE but had a sliver of doubt on WEIRDS (if I had thought about it harder I would have realized it's definitely good); I missed B10 VE(I)NS because I was too focused on the TWS. After I make this play, Jason (who had been recounting the every play in preparation for the endgame) informs me that he misscored his play. The timing couldn't have been worse, since if he had discovered the error before I played, I would have just played VISE. I was pretty steamed after the loss, but it's not Jason's fault that he was diligent enough to do a recount during a close game. Side note: the score for PIMA never got corrected even after his individual recount and then our dual recount after the game. If PIMA had been correctly scored in the first place, I probably wouldn't have played OUTVIE since it would have resulted in a tie before the recount.

#note Final: 413-414. Grumble.
