#note Undeserved after missing my best play last turn. Can't really complain about how the rest of the game unfolded.

#note Oops, not good. I played it without a second thought. Actually all of my energy this turn went into whether I should play DEMARQUE*. Funny that if I make the normal play of QUEUED I'd have an M to play on top of his response.

#note Crud, BENIGN is so good. Blocks the two easiest lines, scores, and draws 6 towards the esses. Keeping the E with GIB is pretty important too. Really bad job by me here.

#note Was cool to find out postgame that VERJUS left EIO

#note I think this is the way to go here but it's tough. Dumb 2 ply sim says I bingo 25% after it, with a ton of those hitting pretty hard, including EVASION on the most common draw of IO and a bunch more (AVENGES, AVENSES, ALEVINS, ENSLAVE) down A, and a bunch more nice options like EVANGELS and maybe the walk off grand slams VASELINE or NOVELLAS down O. On the negative side, my play scores 3 points - but given that the G is the heaviest tile in the bag, it's tough to imagine Thomas scoring well enough to outrun me without also emptying the bag, in which case a bingo nearly always wins.
