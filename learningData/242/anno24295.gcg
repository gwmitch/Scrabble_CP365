#note could do RYU here for board control... and keep a C for blocking plays. occasionally he won't play through crit, and CEII work fine there.

#note only non-exchange play that doesn't open the board... AIRS is fine cause no E's have been played!

#note ODIC has gotta be worth it... I could bait a hook with CORIA, but too often he gets an easy scoring play or bingo. didn't like ciao, but 7 points is still a lot. after a less fishy play I might do it. ARS might be better here, but he bingoes more often than random (not a great board but gey is something), and AIRS responds to bingoes better.

#note was all set to play petaled then the board turned! I have a lot of respect for people who consistently find plays upside down

#note grrr this was annoying to see after a couple minutes
>Jackson_Smylie: AHIKOSX 2E OX +54 307
#note mmm what a nice scorey rack
>Alan_Stern: OW 1N WO +29 294
>Jackson_Smylie: ABEHIKS 3J H.BE +29 336
#note blocking KIBE for 71! didn't know HABI(L)E or (P)EAKISH. Lots of stuff to consider, like both KAB plays, KHI, (L)AKH (which I missed, but setting up the S here isn't too bad). I got the sense he had a good rack with WO so I probably wouldn't have even played LAKH had I seen it. also KIBES. habile is definitely the play. besides those I think hebe is okay

during the game I got super worried about L column bingoes, I felt he had a good rack (shuffling and looking around there). Maybe should have trusted those instincts and played SAHIB or SHEIK. 
>Alan_Stern: ?EERSSU L8 SEcURES +69 363
#note it became clear he wasn't seeing the T hook here.
>Jackson_Smylie: AAADIKS 4K .AD +24 360
#note I should probably reach for a T here, those the S in secures isn't a huge spot to be taken. AAIKS has a lot of scoring potential here. KADI 3b is probably the play to set up a spot I can hit nicely, and only 2 A's in the pool. 
>Alan_Stern: AENQU 4A QUEAN +50 413
>Jackson_Smylie: AABEIKS 13K B.AK +20 380
#note he was very close to playing que(e)n! that would have given me akebias and made my day. not liking my chances at outscoring, so the pool is luckily consonant heavy, and has two T's I can draw.
>Alan_Stern: EGHNNTT B2 TH.G +16 429
>Jackson_Smylie: AEIOSUV N13 .I +12 392
#note champ says KA wins 1/8, and VISE and VASE (which are cool to open up ZOUKS, but get blocked). I liked KI cause I can draw ZOUAVES which he has to block, and the wrong block can let me outrun with ZOUAVE(S).
