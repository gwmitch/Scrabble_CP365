>Charles_Reinke: GIJMPRT -GIJMP +0 23
#note Either I misrecorded my tiles here (unlikely) or I just totally missed the (ZIT)I hook.
>Cheryl_Tyler: CEILOST J6 COIL +25 49
>Charles_Reinke: CDELNRT G8 ..NDER +17 40
#note It's very hard to make a play here without opening up an S hook, so that wasn't really a consideration.

>Charles_Reinke: ELOOSTW L10 OWES +37 196
#note 14M OW was tempting and I should have played it. OWES leaves me down thirty on a closed board with few bingo chances.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AM 14N MA +18 246
>Charles_Reinke: ILOORTY 5E ROOTY +27 223
#note Either this or M3 OLO(G)Y. Setting up all the front hooks on YE seemed like a good idea in case I draw a blank (both are still out).
>Cheryl_Tyler: DEI F11 I.ED +17 263
>Charles_Reinke: BILNRSY M3 BIL.Y +30 253
#note There go all the hooks on YE.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AGOU H1 AGOU.. +24 287
>Charles_Reinke: ?EHKNRS 1F He.RKENS +65 318
#note Quackle wants me to pass up the bingos here? This play leaves me in great shape with so few scoring spots and practically no bingo lanes.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ANV -  +0 287
#note Challenge.
>Charles_Reinke: ELNRUUV 3G V.LE +12 330
#note Blocking the last bingo lane (through the O plus improbable -ING bingos on row 2) because I'm paranoid. O8 NEURUL(AR) is both cool and probably best.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AV E10 VA. +20 307
>Charles_Reinke: AENRRUU F1 .E +7 337
#note I didn't have enough time to figure out this endgame. I definitely need to block Cheryl's B2 FOrAM or anything else that puts the M at F2. I almost did 2B URARE but then panicked about plays at A1, so I made this horrible play instead. My thought was that if Cheryl made a play like 4A FOAMEd or FOEMAn, I would be able to play A4 FURAN for an easy win.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?AEFIMO 4C FOAM +24 331
#note Quackle says this is the only play for Cheryl that wins.
>Charles_Reinke: ANRRUU 2B URAR. +10 347
#note This play loses, luckily, Cheryl was also very low on time and didn't find her win.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?EI A1 IcE +11 342
>Cheryl_Tyler:  (NU) +4 346
#note Somehow I won this game despite a disconcerting amount of very bad mistakes. In future games my multitude of mistakes would result only in losses.
