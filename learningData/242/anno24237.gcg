#note It's possible all of my racks are wrong here, going by memory. If these were my racks, nothing notable happened really. I was just worried I was going to lose for most of the game, and ended up drawing well and winning after making easy and good plays all game.

#note 14C SATEENS is better than this, and SENSATE is better than SENATES in that spot. David didn't want to give easy points on the triple, I think. I don't quite remember what he said.
