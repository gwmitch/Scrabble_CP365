>Joanne_Cohen: GLOW 8E GLOW +16 16
>Jackson_Smylie: EEEFIOU 9G FEU +25 25
#note against an expert feu might be fine, but here I should be avoiding disaster cases, which EEIO is full of. I was a bit confused at her GLOW placement, but not sure she has the J or X... if I think she does then feu gets better
>Joanne_Cohen: HMO 7H OHM +18 34
>Jackson_Smylie: BDEEIOS J9 DOBIE +18 43
>Joanne_Cohen: ?AEGINT E5 NAG.IEsT +86 120
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEERSS 14H RESEDAS +81 124
#note definitely better with SNAGGIEST to avoid big counters (missed the hook)
>Joanne_Cohen: CDEIT 15E CITED +33 153
>Jackson_Smylie: AAEIMNO D8 AMNIA +37 161
#note was baiting the challenge here, so chose it over MANIA. she held it for a while. Kenji still suggests MANIA to shut off easy 15 row plays
>Joanne_Cohen: Q F14 Q. +31 184
>Jackson_Smylie: ELORRRU F2 RULER +15 176
#note LOUR is much better. and LURER to again bait challenge...
>Joanne_Cohen: ?BEEGIT K2 BEIGEsT +76 260
>Jackson_Smylie: NOOPRRY L1 PORNO +33 209
#note missed OPERON, but that closes things off a lot (hopefully I could still open from the T in beigest but this makes things easier for me)
>Joanne_Cohen: JK 3J J..K +30 290
>Jackson_Smylie: ANOPRTY 13I T.POY +44 253
#note things are looking bad here for the left side. I was afraid of making too drastic plays here like PRY C12, but soon somethign will have to happen. after JERK, she could definitely have all consonants, so a ply like PYRO gets better. Maybe PAYOR as well.
>Joanne_Cohen: HISV 15L SHIV +49 339
>Jackson_Smylie: AEILNRT M5 TRENAIL +63 316
>Joanne_Cohen: ELX 1L .LEX +39 378
>Jackson_Smylie: ACFIOUV N10 FA +28 344
#note missed FAVOUR and FOU, both of which are better. FA is really a specially bad play, cause the leave doesn't let me do much. I'll have to end up opening the left side at some point. the worry with FAVOUR is that she dinks at 1a
>Joanne_Cohen: DNU O11 DUN +9 387
>Jackson_Smylie: CINOSUV 10C O.. +3 347
#note might be a bit too desperate - I missed the superior VI(NE) here. I calculated just under a 40% chance that she has neither the T nor the Z - if she has the T and makes an incorrect block still setting up stone, I could win. I'm hoping for VICUNAS here, or a Z. It does give me a shot.

#note and this ends the 5 game losing streak, the first of two disheartening streaks
