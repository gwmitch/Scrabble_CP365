#note Spent a while looking for crazy overlaps down column F, there isn't one. However, there is I5 TELIA on the other side.

#note Looks good but has an obvious downside.

>Charles_Reinke: ?AAHISY O1 ASHY +51 137
#note Saw AlIYAHS (why do the lowercase L and uppercase I look so much alike? Bad design choice), wasn't sure, rationalized that this was better anyway. Maybe it even is. It's better than the cool N2 (T)HISAwAY, at least.

#note There are three places to play Z(I)NG and I spent entirely too much time debating the merits of each. The other ones are probably better since they don't give up the S hook, so I'm not sure why I played this one.
