#note two times this tourney i willed my first-turn opponent to give me an N, and both times it was the 6th tile in their 6-tile play. the other time was when i had a rack of CGILOOY.

#note i hesitate to call this such a major mistake, but equity is equity. OY is 29 points and keeps a much much better leave. but the bag is extremely consonant heavy and i didn't think my chances of getting a bingo were that high.. and i just want to avoid disasters and end the game quickly. SORELY can give up a few Z and J disasters though. so i guess i need to agree with quackle here. OY is 29 points, and just one vowel will many times turn this into a bingo. presumably the sim takes into account the consonant heaviness (which may be even higher given his last move). -15.5
