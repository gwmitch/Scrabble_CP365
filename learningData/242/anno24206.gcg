#note Quackle says 10K (F)EED.  I wanted to get rid of the J first.  If he bingos down from the R or M before then, I'll have a shot at the TWS.

#note I totally botched this endgame.  I thought 13J GAMP was his only out play and was planning on going out with 15A YOGIS.  I should have just played it here.
