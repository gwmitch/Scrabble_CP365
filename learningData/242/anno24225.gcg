#note spent a long while debating between GANJA, JAVA, and TAJ. i like positions like this, even though i don't like the pressure so much (it would be better if i was doing well rather than 5-6 ;P....)  after 13,000 sims, they all sim within 0.4 win% and 0.5 equity. i picked the lowest one, but i would slightly dislike GANJA because he may be consonant heavy after VIGIL.

#note this was a hard move because i'm not super good at anagramming sometimes. i don't remember if i saw PARONYM. i feel like i did but passed it up for whatever reason. i saw MONDAY* and didn't anagram it properly; DYNAMO is definitely best, but DOPEY is also up there. there were lots of choices everywhere and eventually i went with something that i knew was probably not the best, but decent enough. blah. -7.5

#note again failed at equity. i want to say i was trying to conserve my time, because i remember spending a lot of time early and with the YOM move. DEEPEN, or CEPE. -4

#note amazingly, i failed to see 8M FEN, or i saw it and passed it up because of his -3. but he already has the D to score from and the board is generally pretty open. the things one does when one starts nationals with a terrible record 3 times in a row. -3.5
