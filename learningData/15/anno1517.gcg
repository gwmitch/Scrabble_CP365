#note INFLE(X)ED?? Crap!
>Dan_Stock: ?AEGRSY 10A GYRAtES +87 105
#note And so it begins.
>Dallas: ADEEELR A8 RE.ALED +30 49
#note This is a reasonable play.  So says the duck.
>Dan_Stock: CDHIRTY D6 HYDR.TIC +88 193
#note Quackle thinks this is a bad play, just because HYDR(A)TIC* is no good.  But, Quackle didn't count on gullible me.  I held it, I questioned it, but I left it.  It seemed uncharacteristic of Dan to knowingly play a phony when he was already up a bingo.
>Dallas: EEFNQRZ B13 FEZ +41 90
#note Best.
>Dan_Stock: ANO 15B .ONA +14 207
>Dallas: DEEINQR E5 QI +27 117
#note Best.
>Dan_Stock: IMN F4 NIM +36 243
>Dallas: DEEEENR F13 DEE +20 137
#note Quackle prefers NEE, but I like getting rid of the D better.  Maybe that's one more reason why I am where I am in this game.
>Dan_Stock: CIKOORS -IOOC +0 243
>Dallas: EEIMNOR 13F .OMINEER +76 213
#note The only bingo.  Despite missing a bingo I didn't, but should've, known, I really did play well (at least for me) in this game.
>Dan_Stock: DOST N11 DOST +22 265
>Dallas: EIOOTUV O8 VOTE +24 237
#note So, OUTVIE is good too?  I'm just going to start playing OUT-whatever from now on.  They're all good.
>Dan_Stock: IVW K10 WIV. +20 285
>Dallas: ?AGIORU H13 .UG +18 255
#note I had my chances in this game, and I blew 'em.  GIAOURs and GOURAmI - 2 more for the "wish I knew that word" file.
>Dan_Stock: AABCEHO -AA +0 285
>Dallas: ?ABEIOR J4 AEROBIa +64 319
#note Didn't see ISoBARE.  About 30 seconds after hitting my clock, I realized that I gave away 5 points with the placement of the blank.  Idiot!
>Dan_Stock: BCEHKOW -EO +0 285
>Dallas: ACEILLR 5I R.LIC +14 333
#note CALLER K2 would've been much better here.
>Dan_Stock: ANOPSTU L1 UTOP.ANS +74 359
#note His only bingo.  I wasn't sure.  He said later he was unsure.  I thought he was trying a phony because we were nearing end game, and tried to sneak one by me.  I was wrong.
>Dallas: AAAEEKL -  +0 333
>Dan_Stock: AHLS 1K H.LAS +24 383
>Dallas: AAAEEKL 3L .KA +14 347
#note So, now I have a clunky rack, a big deficit, and little time.  I needed to play KA(V)A here, and I didn't, just about ruining my chances to win.
>Dan_Stock: JO 2J JO. +31 414
#note And that pretty much puts it out of reach.
