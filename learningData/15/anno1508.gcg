>hector: AAEEHMV 8D HEAVE +30 30
#note I vowed to play this game a little quicker than usual since I had a pile of work waiting at home. Easy choices like this one help the time factor. Generally I'm using 24-25 minutes on all of my games. 
>fishy: GIIORRU F6 GI.OUR +13 13
#note I don't want to work, I just want to bang on the GUIRO (I5, 20) all day. HOURI at D8 is Q's second choice. 
>hector: AEJMMOY E10 MAYO +26 56
#note There are a lot of passable choices here, most of them better than what I picked. HOMEY D8 wins the runoff; it sets up a huge spot for JAM, any play to the left of the Y sets up a J spot, and maybe we get lucky with an A at 10C and a hook-friendly word. It's usually a mistake to hoard the overrated J for a big score later, but this is one position where you want to hold the J for at least one more turn. Quackle's top three choices and seven of the top 10 do just that. 
>fishy: IIOPRSS I7 PSI +21 34
#note Study about 16,000 seven-letter words and you can bingo with the IIOPRSS rack (the only eight is the plural). Not-Really-Related Fact: Lester's tremendous amamonic for URINOSE is "I'm convinced it's piss" (consonants only). 
>hector: AAEJMRT D11 JAM +48 104
#note Lucky, and best. TAJ in the same spot is about seven valuation points behind. 
>fishy: CIORSTT J9 TRICOTS +65 99
#note Jeff suspected during the game that HEAVE might take an S in front; he mentioned this as soon as we ended. I was, sadly, out to lunch on that one. Quackle punishes you for not playing the optimum bingo here: TRICOTS C2 scores 83 and wins 49 percent of the time; the J9 placement takes 18 less points and wins 35 percent of the time. 
>hector: AAENRRT 15C NARRATE. +77 181
#note I picked the right game for a beat-the-traffic special, a lot of easy choices. 
>fishy: ?DDEEST K3 TEDDiES +69 168
#note Quackle keeps asking about the S-HEAVES hook. Jeff's still in the hole even with the two bingos; his best play here (rEDDEST, C3) only wins about 40 percent of the time. 
>hector: ABFGNPW C9 GNAW +30 211
#note A funky group, though I'd rather draw a clunky rack with some point potential on this sort of board, as opposed to a bunch of singles that don't score easily. GNAW is Q's preferred play here.  
>fishy: EEGLOOZ 12J .LOG +14 182
#note Championship Player suggested CLOZE 12J, but OLEO L3 took the sim runoff. No matter what you do in this spot, your win percentage tops out around 27-28 percent. 
>hector: BEFOPSV 13L FOB +27 238
#note Best, not surprisingly. Hector leakage soon to follow in subsequent moves. Jeff's next turn is interesting. 
>fishy: ?AEENOZ B6 ZOEA +36 218
#note Kudos if you found bENZOATE at 3E, but it's only 68 and has a heavy give-back; the proper path here is to score with the Z and look to bingo next turn. Jeff's play is good, but ZOEAE or ZONAE are a shade better. As for my next play, I assure you anything you pick will be better than what I did. 
>hector: EFPQRSV 4J P.RV +18 256
#note Wrong, wrong, wrong. PERV doesn't score or generate turnover with a rack that's screaming for it. FEVER 4H does a lot of good things; scores 30, four new picks, and maybe I get lucky with a U/I grab next turn (note the naked E at 8K). FEVERS 4H isn't that far behind (!), I suppose for the EQUIP threat; I'd never play that, but it's interesting. Any logical exchange also beats the pants off my crappy play. 
>fishy: ?ADEENT A8 AgENTED +83 301
#note Second-best bingo - lATENED is two more points. Jeff's now got a 70-percent chance to win from his perspective (not considering my real-life rack). 
>hector: EFINNQS 11I Q. +11 267
#note I didn't like any plays here, but surprisingly this is Q's second choice, behind QIS at N2. I discounted that play because of the O column; while the bag doesn't have any monster threat for that three-tile slot, I didn't see the point of burning the case S and giving back most of the points if he had one of several Is. What I didn't consider at the time was the odd composition of the bag; of the 28 tiles unseen to me, only three of them (D, N, T) would back-hook an I at O3. As it turns out, he likely would have played YIN in that spot had I gone with QIS. Blah, blah, blah. 
>fishy: CEEINUY 14N YE +24 325
#note The Duck likes EVINCE M3, YIM 14M and YE 14M (funny how one spot over makes such a big difference). 
>hector: EFINNS 15N EF +38 305
#note "Love is all around, no need to waste it." That's always bothered me; if love is all around, can't we be a little frivolous with it? 
>fishy: BCEIINU D4 BUNC. +24 349
#note Did you see the Yankees signed Sidney Ponson? That's pretty freakin' funny. 
>hector: ILNNOSW E3 WINO +26 331
#note It's worth spending both of my vowels, especially with the spider looming. Jeff said "I hope you don't have the X" when he played YE and I didn't take that as a bluff. 
>fishy: AEHIIRU I13 HI. +21 370
#note Enjoy every sandwich: turkey breast, topped with honey mustard. Del-i-ish-us. 
>hector: EILLNST J2 LI. +9 340
#note This is kinda funny - you ask Q to produce 50 plays, and LIP doesn't show up. Championship Player doesn't mention it either. But then you add LIP and let it run in the sim, and it wins. I only saw one of the two bingos here, by the way; pretty pathetic, Ty. 
>fishy: AEIIORU I1 AE +4 374
#note This play wins just 29 percent of the time (!), I guess because Q is expecting to get X-whacked at 8K. The sim champ is DUI 14A, which doesn't look that promising to me at all (Q says it wins at a 58-percent clip, but it doesn't draw an inference from LIP). 
>hector: EILLNST 8K .L +3 343
#note I knew this play blew when I made it. But what should I do? Q says MOLL at 13D (emptying on the number) wins 45 percent of the time. The nifty SMOLT 13C (which Jeff saw and mentioned post-game) scores 34 and wins 40 percent of the time. My crummy choice wins if your opponent goes into an epileptic seizure and takes a time penalty. 
>fishy: IIKORUU 1G OK. +21 395
#note Of the ten plays in my simulation window, this is the only one that's showing a win percentage of 100 percent. Well done, Jeff. KOA in the same spot somehow loses ~6 percent of the time. 
>hector: DEILNST 9H N... +6 349
#note I knew LISTED was there for me next turn, but this doesn't look best. I'm tired. I was tired then, too. 
>fishy: IIRUUX 2F XI +27 422
#note Best. After all that X-hunting, the spider nets just 27. 
>hector: DEILST N2 LISTED +28 377
#note I did win some other games that day, gaining 60-70 rating points. Wait, it wasn't rated. Never mind. But trust me on the sandwich. 
>hector:  (IRUU) +8 385
