#note  I didn't think at the time about the possible Z bomb.  Q likes HUE @ D6 best.
>Gerry_Smith: AZ C7 ZA +46 90
#note should have considered the Z.

#note  urp.  no HEMI*, just HEMIN and HEMIC
>Gerry_Smith: Y 12C .Y +14 104
>Brett_H: DDEILNS K1 SLIDDEN +72 187
#note  DINDLES making HEMIN is best, and DINDLES @ K1 is better as well.
>Gerry_Smith: ??DENST -  +0 104
#note had she not challenged, she could have put down two 3x3s:  DISSENTS or SENSATED
>Brett_H: CIIORTU 1F CURIO. +24 211
>Gerry_Smith: ??DENST 3G DEST.Ned +70 174
#note Most of the highest scoring bingoes hook the N for HEMIN.  Another one is T(O)U(R)NEDOES! (OUTSNORED=TOURNEDOS, but TOURNEDO*=UNROOTED)

>Brett_H: ACEFLTT H10 .ECTAL +33 272
#note I considered F(L)EA @ 2J, but CLTT didn't look too great.  Quackle likes FACET making HEMIC.  eh, I like mine.  this scores well and keeps the F for follow-up scoring plays.
>Gerry_Smith: AEM 2K .AME +19 229
>Brett_H: AEFIORT 15G F.OATIER +62 334
#note  the only bingo.  I also considered just hooking the F for FLAME/OFT and keeping AEIORT.  nah.
>Gerry_Smith: AAV -  +0 229
#note challenge.
>Brett_H: DEEGHOO 14J HE +28 362
#note  I wanted to go ahead and take that easy scoring spot, but Quackle likes ECHOED for it's defense blocking almost all of the lines and lack of hooks.  COOEED is pretty close behind cause it blocks all of the lines, but the GH leave is pretty bad.
