#note Jim spent a great deal of time on this play, telling me later he had a blank. His clock was down to 8 minutes after this, and he was in time trouble the rest of the way. He didn't miss a bingo...

#note Mistake. TREF in same spot prevents hook, and 9K FAST for 35

#note Jim overdrew, and it cost him an S, which I picked up on the next turn...
>Steve_Hartsman: BFILRSU 5B FUBSI.R +24 386
#note Spent over 5 minutes on this play. With the unseen pool, only possible bingo in row 13 is sUNNIER. Lots of potential bingos in row 4 or 5, and possibly column C. Q likes my play or 5A SUBFILE for the same score, but it opens the triple. I'm hoping to draw a vowel as the last tile, to give some flexibility...

#note ...unfortunately, I draw a consonant, and have no winning options. This close loss, coupled with a final round loss, cost me a shot at cashing in the lucrative NAST. Jim went on to win the NAST booty...
