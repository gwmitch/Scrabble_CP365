>Jason: EIRUUWX -UUW +0 0
#note For those playing along at home, we're at four exchanges on six opening racks, plus one Q said I should've exchanged on. I'm a little surprised Q prefers keeping E and ER (and ERX) to this.
>Steve_Anstandig: ?AEILNO 8C ALIENOr +64 64
#note Well, at least I'm going first, which helps blunt my winning opponents' M.O. of opening with a blank bingo and me opening with an exchange.
>Jason: ACEIRRX 9C XI +36 36
>Steve_Anstandig: ?EELUPY 10C EELY +28 92
>Jason: ACEERRU E10 .URE +8 44
#note Eventually realized I wasn't going to score, so leave well and create an -R hook. A few plays are marginally better, but I like this.
>Steve_Anstandig: ?CMOOPU G2 COMPOU.d +65 157
#note Nice find. Only playable bingo, too. Probably would've missed it.
>Jason: ACEIRSZ J2 CRAZIES +83 127
#note At club on my birthday, Anstandig had ?AEIRSZ, played cRAZIES and missed AR(A)bIZES for 203, a fact I pointed out on LJ. Anstandig noticed and posted a comment (but he attached it to one of my BAT posts ... weird). Anyhow, we were talking about it before the game, how he told his wife "Jason really knows how to rub it in," laughing. So, as I start to put this down, I say "I think you'll recognize this word." "Could've had ARABIZES!" he said. Anstandig's cool like that; I know other people would've ripped my head off for pointing out stuff like that. P.S. If there was a high non-bingo prize, like at BAT, eschew the couple equity points and play the double-doubles CA(P)IZES or CA(P)SIZE, each 80.
>Steve_Anstandig: DIILLNW 5J .ILL +26 183
#note Although I did detect an edge to his voice when he said it. Perhaps because he pointed out after the game that I blocked his WIND(M)ILL. And I nearly played CRAZIES at 14D, too!
>Jason: AAEHPTU F5 UH +30 157
>Steve_Anstandig: DGIMNRW E2 WIND +28 211
>Jason: AAEKNPT D1 KATA +37 194
#note Never looked for bingos, only for my best parallel play there. Stupid PA(R)TAKEN. And then I missed KAPA on top of it!
>Steve_Anstandig: GMNORVW 1A WOR. +33 244
>Jason: BEENPTT H3 PEEN +29 223
#note Cute, but not in Q's top 10. B(R)ENT for 20 at 3I is best.
>Steve_Anstandig: GHIMNUV C4 VUM +14 258
#note "OK," I think, "now we make our move!"
>Jason: ABDEETT L1 BATT.ED +26 249
#note Second time I decline to take control of the game. Stupid TAB(L)ETED.
>Steve_Anstandig: EFGHINY I7 F.Y +25 283
>Jason: ABEFIRS 12C BA.F +18 267
#note Third time I decline to take control of the game. Stupid FIR(E)BASE.
>Steve_Anstandig: EGHINNO 1L .ONG +21 304
>Jason: EIINRST 3L .I +4 271
#note IR(E) at 13C is better; scores 12 more and the STINE or INSERT leaves are comparable, esp. with this pool. But I don't like constricting that lane.
>Steve_Anstandig: EHIJNOT 2A EH +25 329
>Jason: EGINRST N5 STINGER +76 347
#note Was hoping to play (W)RESTING for 89 there, damn Steve for blocking. Then I saw (WE)STERING for 92, but wasn't confident enough. It's good. I coulda used those 16 points. WESTERING wins 5/8 of the time, STINGER 1/2 the time.
>Steve_Anstandig: AIIJNOT 13B JAN. +32 361
>Jason: AADQRRV 14C RAD +18 365
#note Now now, Quackle, don't agree with me! This is an atrocious play! I put it down, see it doesn't block the big O play, pick it up, but see nothing better/think "maybe he'll miss ORAD" (like that's gonna happen), and put it down again. Missed RADAR in that spot, which leaves one in the bag with an IS draw somewhat likely. (J)AR is a fraction of a percentage point behind with a higher valuation, so I'm going with that as the play. Risky, but with the unseen pool, it's unlikely he'll hurt me badly along row 15.
>Steve_Anstandig: DEGIIOT B13 .OG +32 393
>Jason: AEOQRSV E7 Q. +11 376
#note Looked obvious, so insta-played it, then hit my clock and thought "Wait, should I have held it and played for the I or T being in the bag?" It's not in Q's top 10, but Q also says I have no win. Besides, the S was in the bag (A common theme from my MM: Power tiles kept gravitating to the bottom of the bag; Berofsky, Grob, this game.)
>Steve_Anstandig: DEIIOTT 11H DOTTIE. +16 409
#note I know keeping SAVORE(R)S open is too much to hope for (even if he didn't have me tracked right or didn't see it, which he did), but when I saw what he had, I thought "Maybe I can outrun him." Steve said he thought similarly until he saw this. DOTIE(R)'s better, though, doesn't give up plays to the triple and you're guaranteed 6 with IT as opposed to 4 with I.
>Jason: AEORSSV H10 E.VORS +42 418
#note Can't blame me for trying.
>Jason: AEORSSV --  -42 376
#note Wait, yes you can. I know I don't plan on being in a position where spread matters (in the end, I wasn't), but I've got to be more disciplined and not do stupid stuff out of total frustration, turning what should be a 13-point loss if I play DROVE there into a 57-point one. I made way too many spread-hemorrhaging decisions this tourney (ALEROOM*, this, etc.).
