#note Missed another bingo, though I didn't know it: 14I MALTHAS 86. I've committed the top 13,000 7s and 8s by probability into SuperMemo so far. This one comes in at 13,787. Sigh...

>Steve_Hartsman: EEFFPYY 13L YE +21 341
#note I see C5 PUFFY, but it doesn't score much more, and it sets up a potentially juicy TW. I have to assume he has both blanks, and I need to keep scoring tiles and keep the board closed...

#note Holding on to the F's pays off. 
>Winter: AEL A1 ALE. +21 364

#note 7A YAPS/YEPS for 2 more
>Winter: ?IKLT O3 KITtL. +18 405
