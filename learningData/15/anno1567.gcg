>Glenn_D: AGIO 8H AGIO +10 10
>Dave_T: ANPTUWY 9K YUP +16 16
#note I spent a while on this play and didn't really like YUP.  Quackle likes TOWNY POUTY YAUP at 7K or 9K and AWNY at 7J.

#note Best
>Glenn_D: IIII -IIII +0 42
>Dave_T: ACENRST 5B CARSNET +72 133
>Dave_T: ACENRST --  -72 61
#note This is embarassing.  I really didn't want to approach the TWS and somehow convinced myself to play this.  I even thought it looked suspicously like SARSNET.
>Glenn_D: INX 5I NIX +42 84
>Dave_T: ACENRST 9B TANRECS +65 126
#note This time I get it right.
>Glenn_D: EFK 8A KEF +37 121
>Dave_T: BBCHINT F8 B.NTHIC +22 148
#note This is second to 7F BIB, but I'm not sure about the CHNT leave.
>Glenn_D: ORUV C8 ..VOUR +24 145
>Dave_T: ABDIQUY 4G QUAY +26 174
#note Apparently 12A YAUD is a far superior play.

>Dave_T: ?BDEIRV 12A DR.B +18 192
#note O1 DERIVE is best
>Glenn_D: HOT A12 .OTH +24 169
>Dave_T: ?AEIOPV 3J PAVE +27 219
#note 14D PICOWAVE would have been cool had I known it.  5E VIA and OVA are better than my play but I was paranoid about a huge JA- play going down.
>Glenn_D: LLU H1 LUL. +12 181
>Dave_T: ?INORST 11E S.RONTIa +78 297
#note I didn't know STRONTIC which is more defensive.
>Glenn_D: ?DEFIMR 13F .nFIRMED +78 259
>Dave_T: AIMOOSZ -  +0 297
#note I challenged INFIRMED thinking it INFIRM would be the adjective form.  Turns out it's a verb.  I should have taken the time to see I had FIZ for 45 as a reply.

>Dave_T: AIMOOSZ 5E ZOA +36 333
>Glenn_D: EO B14 OE +13 290
>Dave_T: DIIMORS N1 MID +23 356
#note Quackle prefers 4M MID but this is a close second.  It leaves one in the bag, and since I can't block the bingo lines, I figured I'd score and hopefully be able to outrun him if he got down a bingo.  He also can't play through the M with the J.
>Glenn_D: EIJLNST 1L LI.N +21 311
>Dave_T: EGGIORS 15H .GGIER +9 365
#note EGGIER isn't good.  12L GIG followed by SORE is the best sequence.  If he blocks it, I have SOREL sticking him with the J.
