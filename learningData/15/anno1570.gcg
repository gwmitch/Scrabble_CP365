#note challenge.  It might have been because she was hoping for a specific consonant to go with her close rack.  An L, D, P or U would have given her some pretty easy bingoes.  I seriously doubt it though.

#note  for some reason I saw LEPROSE but not ELOPERS from this rack.  I was feeling a little brazen after she challenged my opening bingo, so thought I would try a fast one.  Should have looked a little longer.

#note considering her last play, I probably shouldn't have opened a lane with an S unseen, but I wasnted to make it harder for her to snipe easy points with the X and/or Z.  This does that nicely, but gives a pretty decent bingo line.
