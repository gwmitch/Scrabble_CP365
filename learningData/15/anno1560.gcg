>Dave_Koenig: ?DEIOSZ F5 oDO.IZES +91 91
#note It's rare to make a 91 point bingo and a 43 point error on the same turn.  I knew both front hooks for EMERGES, but I didn't think about them until *just* after I pressed my clock.  I got so caught up looking for double-doubles or plays to the triple and missed the really killer play.
>Ben_Dweck: CEJNORU I1 CONJURE. +69 145
>Dave_Koenig: ADEEEIU 1F DEU.E +24 115
#note ADIEU G10 is another reasonable choice.
>Ben_Dweck: EFIKN 12A KNIFE. +36 181

>Ben_Dweck: OX 2I .XO +51 232
>Dave_Koenig: AILMPRT 4I .IMP +30 240
#note The board was looking conducive for nines through disconnected letters.  I thought of IMPARTIAL/PRIMATIAL, but the needed letters weren't there.  JIMP seems like the most logical play.
>Ben_Dweck: ELO B6 OLE +26 258
>Dave_Koenig: AAGLORT E5 GAL. +19 259
#note I missed a couple of better plays here, GAROTE C3 and GALEA E5.

#note The only bingo.
>Ben_Dweck: IPW 15A WI.P +36 373
>Dave_Koenig: ABGHNRV E11 H.RB +28 363
#note I knew that with both Y's unseen, one of them would end up at E15 eventually.  It seemed better to set that up than to give easy plays to the triple by placing HERB horizontally.

#note This is where things get really interesting. The only way I can play the Q is SUQ N5, but without an I and three of them unseen to me, the play seemed to be giving him easy plays on the O column, e.g., IVY or TIVY.  I wanted to turn over as many tiles as I could to try to get one of the I's for myself, so that I could play either QIS N3 or QADI 6D, or maybe even QAIDS N1 if I get the A.  It's risky to play off the U, but I didn't see a way to turn over the tiles without spending it.  Quack comes up with a nice play that I did not find: DOGMA K1.  I only thought of OHMAGE in that spot.  I was already starting to run very short of time.
>Ben_Dweck: Y 15A ....Y +26 445
>Dave_Koenig: ADDHNQS D4 DAH +24 438
#note I was torn between three choices here, the move I played, AH G10, and AND E3.  Didn't love blocking the QADI spot, but I felt that I needed the turnover to try to get an I and the points too.
