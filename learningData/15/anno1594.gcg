>Steve_Grob: ABDIOTU 8D ABOUT +16 16
>Jason: ACDQTTW G7 Q.AD +25 25
#note Jason: Q likes exchanging, but it's very close. This play's seventh-best, and yet less than one percentage point behind the leader, which I believe was keeping ACT.
>Steve_Grob: DEFIMSW 11C WIFES +37 53
>Jason: CRTTTVW D8 .TT.C +14 39
#note Jason: Second verse, same as the first. Q likes exchanging, but it's close.
>Steve_Grob: ADGHKMS 8A GAD..... +36 89
#note Jason: I was focused on the other potential extension, RUN(ABOUT).
>Jason: EIIRTVW H6 WI. +17 56
>Steve_Grob: AHIKMS B7 H.IK +21 110
>Jason: EGINRTV 5E VERT +21 77
#note Jason: Damn him blocking GRIEV(A)NT! Second play in a row I wasn't thrilled with (I didn't set up the T- hook to play for 21 and kill the board), but it's the second play in a row Q says I made the best play.
>Steve_Grob: AEEIMSX D4 MAX +32 142
>Jason: EEGIMNZ F3 GE.Z +34 111
>Steve_Grob: DEEIOOS 10D .OD.IES +27 169
#note Steve: only play i saw that scored. i'm trying to run with the lead. Jason: Couldn't put him on a leave here. 
>Jason: ?AEIIMN C6 AI. +20 131
#note Jason: Missed a handful of bingos here, most of which I knew. A little FPS; I mean, 20 wasn't bad on this board, and I figure I can bingo at 9I, 9K, down column J, or even along row 13 next turn.
>Steve_Grob: AAAENNT J4 ANNATE. +9 178
#note Steve: Not entirely sure of the leftover letter here.
>Jason: ?EIMNRU C3 UM +14 145
#note Jason: In hindsight, MU at K4 is clearly better; I was too worried he'd make a column L play that scored and blocked, leaving to the start of a vicious "I open, he closes" cycle. I'm still thinking that, even constricting myself to making the blank an S, I can bingo along row 13 with a decent draw.
>Steve_Grob: AFGJOPR 2A JOG +28 206
#note Steve: Again, this rack is just a guess at what I had. Jason: Insta-played.
>Jason: ?EEILNR 9J .EL +3 148
#note Jason: I still struggle with racks like this. I feel like I never draw blanks, in part because my turnover is usually worse because I fall in love with certain combos and refuse to break them up. And in part because I rarely keep the blank; usually I'm drawing into leaves ready-made for it while playing for too few points.
>Steve_Grob: AEFOPPR L8 F.OPPER +36 242
#note Steve: Given j's last play, i knew I was taking a chance here, but felt it was worth it given the points i was getting.
>Jason: ?EEINRV 15I VERsINE +91 239
#note Jason: Fortunately, I pick a high-pointer and get more than Steve probably thought I would.
>Steve_Grob: AILO 8L .OIL +21 263
>Jason: CINRTYY M7 C.Y +26 265
#note Jason: I really wanted to play TYIY(N) at N11 for the coolness factor, but figured C(O)Y was better. I should've played TYIYN ... at 3J! I totally spaced on TANNATES! Never even considered it a bingo line! And then COY's good equity-wise, but not in Q's top 10! I suck! Must. Learn. Hooks.
>Steve_Grob: AEE A1 A.EE +36 299
#note Jason: Running short of vowels now.
>Jason: AINORTY 14J YA. +29 294
#note Jason: Remember how I forgot TANNATES? Yeah, (G)YRATION/T(ANNATES) for 91 could've made life a lot easier for me.
>Steve_Grob: EHILLNN 13G HILL +18 317
>Jason: BINORTU K4 BOUT +24 318
#note Jason: I wanted to play BURTO(N) at 3I, but not to go 7-on-7. Best equity-wise, but not in Q's top 10. I may sim this one for a while one day.
>Steve_Grob: ENNORRS L3 SORN +24 341
#note Jason: Q's top six plays involve fishing off the N, but that only wins if the blank is drawn. One in eight's the best he can do.
>Jason: ?INORSU 14A URINOSe +70 388
#note Jason: Yeah, I drew ?OSU. Call me a luckbox. After BOUT, I had about 2:30; I saw URINOSe quickly (missing bOURSIN), and then furiously looked for bingos through the L. pUR(L)OINS is the only one that plays, and I probably won't find it, even though I can go a few minutes over and still bingo out to win. Of course, if he goes across row 14 and blocks, I can probably outrun him. Just bad luck on his part.
>Jason:  (DENR) +10 398
