#note In situations like this where there are so many different bingos that fit, it's hard to find the best one and often it's not worth the time on the clock.  SALPIDS is the one bingo that avoids slotting any vowels next to bonus squares.  However, given that Sam is still a bit down after the bingo, the volatility is not necessarily bad for him.
>Dave_Koenig: ACEEMOO 11I CAMEO +26 271
#note The best play is CAEOMA 2J 32.

#note Sam was threatening me with a massive WELDER 15C, and it was totally necessary to block in this spot.  However, this play is the losing move.  The winner is OP 14H, which threatens an out of ENVIRO.  After that best play is REDREW C1, NOVA L2, LEXIS 7K and I come out a narrow winner.  Now, Sam is in the driver's seat, but it requires good technique to clinch it.
>Sam_Timer: DEELRRW 15C WELD +28 411
#note Scores nicely, but leaves himself the awkward ERR.  At first I thought he would be unable to go out, so I looked for my best out in two.  But after scanning the board for a while I finally found the place where ERR fit...
>Dave_Koenig: INOOPR O9 ION +13 417
#note ...and I thought I would win for sure with PORK or DORP on the next play.
>Sam_Timer: ERR L10 ..R.ER +14 425
#note There was a second out!  Sam had run himself down to less than a minute left before playing WELD.  Nice job on the endgame.  Quackle approves.
>Sam_Timer:  (OPR) +10 435
#note Postscript: instead of ION, my best play for spread was ORPIN 9A, but I still lose by a few after AERIER.
