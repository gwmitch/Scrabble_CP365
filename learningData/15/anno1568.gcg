#note F10 FIE is best.

#note I wasn't completely sure about GLIFF, but this scores more and takes away a potentially dangerous spot.

#note Quackle likes 9G INN, I would have played RENNIN had I known that spelling.

#note My play sucks.  C3 UNWET is best.  I am suprised this is ranked lower than TUNE given there are more As unseen.  I guess AAE is much better than EEE.
