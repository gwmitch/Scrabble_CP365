#note After this game, really great to lunch with with the Illinoisans (Illinoisers?). Obviously Haughney and Turissini are great players (took our money and our rating points by co-dominating Div. B), and Kowalik's an awesome guy as well. Plus, I'd use information they gave me to beat Zeigler in round 12 (stay tuned).

#note HU(N) at 7I is better, but I knew I'd have to work to keep the board open. I didn't want that K in an open quadrant mucking up the board for any length of time.
>Steve_Krieger: AFX J2 FAX +33 160
#note Counted as 35 and not corrected.

#note Q likes PO(XI)ER in the same spot better.

#note After the game, I checked LOUPIER* from the turn before. OK. Then LOURING, and when the screen came up green, I let out a "dammit!" When I looked at the fours, I didn't notice LOUR's definition; more concerned with the C front hook; Zeigler once played LOUR coming from behind to set it that hook up against an unwitting opponent (me). Maybe after LOURING I'll actually draw something, so I'm partly to blame for the bagging, but even after LOURING, I'm a less than 25% favorite.

#note Sunday morning, Steve's SO, Gerry Smith, asks me how my name is pronounced and I tell her. "Oh, I've been pronouncing it wrong," she said. Which made me wonder, since I barely know her, why was she pronouncing my name and to who?
>Steve_Krieger: EE J8 .EE +9 209
#note Oh, THAT's where the E's are. I was wondering.
>Jason: BGIINRT 14L BIG +23 163
#note Gotta take a chance and hope he keeps missing.
>Steve_Krieger: AADEIRS 10N .A +11 220
>Jason: EILNRTU G5 LU. +5 168
#note Maybe I should've blown it up here with RUTILE along row 15. I dunno. Close call, could go either way.
>Steve_Krieger: ADEIRSU 1A RESIDUA. +80 300
#note At first he thought he'd missed but found the only bingo in time.
>Jason: EEFINRT 15G REFINE +37 205
#note My ability (or lack thereof) to come back from big deficits (and usually hemorrhage spread by making them bigger) used to be a huge weakness. But I've had so much practice in Chicago and here (starting with the Kenas near-miss), I'm getting better at it. Gotta keep scoring and hope to get lucky. Although, Q likes my runner-up choice, EF at 2A, better.

#note Congrats to Steve on a great tourney. 9-5, cashed, from 1610 to 1675, passing me and making my 0-5 against him look more defensible. "One of these days," he said after the tourney, "you're gonna make up for it all in one game and score like 850." I'll take it. Cresta or Yorra (whoever won that 830-490 game) needs to be knocked off their perch. :)
>Jason: AGINQTT J14 Q. +31 262
#note Speaking of the Cresta-Yorra game, one statistical oddity: The high loss of the tournament was in Div. C! Chuck Valleau beat Joyce Spalding 449-447 in round one. Hey, it's Madness!
>Steve_Krieger: HO 15N OH +18 369
>Jason: AGINRTT E1 ..TING +16 278
#note Q likes all the T fishes leaving the RATING stem, but the board's too tight. Not on Q's radar, but put this in sim and it jumps to the top.

>Jason: ACEIRRT F9 .R +4 282
#note As I pout about him blocking ERRATIC/CIRRATE, he chuckles (not in a mean-spirited way, mind you). "Both S's?" I ask. "Yeah," he says. "Sorry. I really have no explanation for how I draw against you." Obviously not, or he'd do it against more people. And if I had an explanation, I'd be working on stopping it. Maybe I'll have my own takeoff on Bowman's "Seeded low or I won't go" mantra. "Krieger's home (or in a different division) or I won't go!" Potentially catchy if you take out the parenthetical part. :)
>Steve_Krieger: ADISSTV 11C VIDS +19 449
#note I think he said EG were the last two, and I remember him being one off from ADVISES. If this rack is correct, he missed DISTAV(E)S. How is that good when IDATES+V=DATIVES/VISTAED and no DISTAVE? (fires up Zyz) OK, the definition is for DISTAFF. DISTAVES is an alternate spelling of a singular DISTAFF? I hate English. That's it, I'm switching to Volost.
>Jason: ACEIIRT C3 CERTAI. +20 302
#note VIDS is a nice block, but he didn't need to. Missed (S)ATIRIC/A(TOM) for 10 more.
>Steve_Krieger: AEGST M1 GATS +25 474
#note Stupid here gave him a better out: ST(R)A(N)G(L)E/(LOUP)E at 5A for 16. Geez, I don't mind losing to good players, but somebody who misses that?! :D
