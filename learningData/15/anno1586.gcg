>Jason: IJRTUUU -JUUU +0 0
#note Yikes. I also picked a U when drawing for first. This could be a bad omen.
>Elaine_Glowniak: EFW 7H FEW +23 95
>Jason: FHILRTT F6 FR.TH +27 27
#note You poker fans out there might remember Matusow's jingle after his suckout at the WSOP where he made the final table. To slightly alter Pianowski's mini-parody, "Scrabble, Scrabble, it's all about skill. Start with three U's and run uphill."
>Elaine_Glowniak: ACIO E3 CIAO +17 112
>Jason: EGIILNT 9F .INGE +29 56
#note Cool fit, but Quackle likes fishing off the I better, even putting exchanging the I ahead of this.
>Elaine_Glowniak: AM D4 MA +18 130
>Jason: ADDILOT 10J DIDO +22 78
#note Close. DILDO's the best play.
>Elaine_Glowniak: IQ 9C QI +25 155
>Jason: AAELTUY C9 .UALE +28 106
#note I was a little surprised; I know the L goes better with the Y than the T does, but I didn't think it was enough to make QUATE a better play. But it is.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ISX 11C .XIS +34 189
>Jason: ADDKSTY 11H DAYS +32 138
#note A lousy play (missed TA(C)KY at 3C for 41), made worse by the fact that I put down the better KAYS and replaced the K with a D, even though I knew DKT isn't six points better than DDT.
>Elaine_Glowniak: AGO 12G GOA +11 200
>Jason: DEEIKRT 12C .ID +29 167
#note Elaine beat me here, Berofsky in round 3, but finished 3-11. Ironically, after beating me here, her record against me is now 3-11.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ?ACESTU N5 ACUtEST +75 275
>Jason: EEKRRTV O1 EVERT +29 196
#note Why don't I know REVET? It's slightly better, as it gives me the options of ending an eight in R.
>Elaine_Glowniak: EW M9 W.E +21 296
>Jason: GKLORRT M2 GROK +25 221
#note Last year I was 16 or 17 seed of 32, so started with seed 1 (Armstrong) and 32 (Mannella). This year, since my rating's approx. the same, I open 16 seed (Glowniak), 1 seed (Berofsky). And both times, I've beaten the top seed. Hurrah for consistency!
>Elaine_Glowniak: ILOO L3 OLIO +22 318
>Jason: AHLRSTY O7 HAT +32 253
#note Looked for plays at O11, just missed HYLAS. Q likes the cute HYLA in the same spot, since I have the case S.
>Elaine_Glowniak: BO C5 BO +9 327
>Jason: LLNRSVY H11 ..LLY +27 280
#note Q says to exchange here.
>Elaine_Glowniak: EEJ B6 JEE +51 378
#note I assume she set this up for herself. She didn't like how dangerous it was, but when she hit her clock, I said: "With what I've got, it's the play."
>Jason: BNNRSVZ 7A N.B +18 298
#note Q says to exchange here, too; but even if I bingo, there's no way it's going to be enough. Gotta kill the hot spot and stop the bleeding.
>Elaine_Glowniak: NU N1 NU +20 398
#note Hey, I was gonna do that!
>Jason: NRSTUVZ 14H .UTZ +15 313
#note Duh! (Y)UTZ is one more and doesn't leave a monster A play open. 
>Elaine_Glowniak: AEINPRT 3C PA.T +21 419
#note "Well, that'd be a good rack on most boards," I said when I had her tracked. She chickened out on APTER and missed the other plays at 15K (ATRIP, ARPEN). I know she was in time trouble, but I was shocked she didn't leave herself an out in two.
>Jason: EIMNRSV 15D NERV. +12 325
>Elaine_Glowniak: EINR 2F ERN +9 428
#note Apparently neither of us knows EPACT.
