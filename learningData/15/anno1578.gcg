#note Haven’t quite gotten to FRAULEIN yet. In theory, four semesters of German plus knowing words like HAUSFRAU are good should have been enough to get it down, but we all know better than that by know, don’t we?

>Kelly: ADEERTY K8 .AYED +18 40
#note CP gives a few percentage points edge to fishing with Y(IN) or (F)EY. It still doesn’t usually occur to me to fish with racks like this that aren’t obviously bitchin’, especially without an S.
>Rod_Torfulson: AEEHIRX 12G EXHE.RA +52 100
>Kelly: EMORSST 13C STORM +27 67
#note Didn’t see the one good way to use the X: SE(X)TOS. MOS-11G also looks better.
>Rod_Torfulson: IJNOTTU M2 JUT +23 123
>Kelly: ?AELMRS D6 MARLiES. +70 137
#note No idea what happened here. I had been looking for a good time to use the E hook at N12, but never even looked at it here. Sadly, this probably won’t be the worst game I ever play.
>Rod_Torfulson: ILNOPTT N1 TOP +32 155
>Kelly: AENQRWZ C7 ZA +44 181
#note Scoring and waiting to deal with the Q is the right idea, but perhaps WREN-N10 or RAZE-C5 are a bit better.

>Kelly: DEENQRW N11 WEND +35 216
#note Finally.

#note Hey, the duck actually loves this one.
>Rod_Torfulson: AHLRTUW O1 AW +34 298
>Kelly: ADDEQRR H5 QAD. +14 258
#note This is why I’m doing this. I couldn’t decide between QADI and QAID, but CP likes QAID more. As I would soon learn, QADI is going to partially block bingo lanes if and when I make a play up the E column to open things up.
>Rod_Torfulson: HILRTTU C10 THU. +17 315
>Kelly: BDEEGRR E2 BREDE +20 278
#note CP likes BR(A)G-6F, which I considered but rejected in favor of opening things up more. It was going to be hard to bingo without an S as the board stood, but maybe I had to just hope to draw one. Anyway, a better way to do what I was trying to do was GREBE.

>Rod_Torfulson: IILOORS 2B ORI.I +18 375
>Kelly: ACEGIOR F6 GO +17 305
#note Nothing’s too palatable here. Best in the report is C(I)AO-D1, which hangs on to the G for the A9 hook but empties the bag.

#note And now, I think I’ll go hug and kiss some poisonous snakes.
