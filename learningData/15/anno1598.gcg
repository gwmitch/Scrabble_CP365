#note Q prefers FU(M)Y here leaving [MNIR] for fewer points.  I really like the balance and turover of RUMMY.  This was by far the lowest simming play of the game (4% points back and 11th in the list).  Does anyone have any input as to why it might be so ill-favored?

#note I also saw the bingos through the I, but this is obviously best.
>Margaret_Sutherland: HILST 13B HILTS +34 107
>Brett_H: ?EEEOXZ G2 EX +36 164
#note  ZE(R)O is another good option.  Both plays leave the other as a comeback.
>Margaret_Sutherland: DLV C10 L.V.D +9 116
>Brett_H: ?EEORYZ I10 .YE +10 174
#note  this might have been my favorite play of the whole tourney.  I was surprise when it actually came back at the top of Qs list!  Of course she could really burn me with the V or P.

>Brett_H: ?EILORZ H12 ZORI +94 268
#note  but I get lucky.  This was one of 2 +90 point non-bingo Z plays this tournament.

#note  Quackle prefers to close down the triple lanes (INHAULER and SUPERNAL are at the top), but this one scored more and was nifty, so there.
>Margaret_Sutherland: DEO K4 DOE +22 253
>Brett_H: AEEINOV 14A NO.I +22 365
#note NOVAE is the obvious play here.  This was a very lazy play on my part.  
>Margaret_Sutherland: OW 15A OW +30 283
>Brett_H: AEEEOOV 5E OVA.E +16 381
#note  Q prefers EAVE @ o8, but it seems very needless to open up the triple lane without an S.  Plus I can see maybe that [EEO] is worse than [EOO], but that and the two points just doesn't seem like enough to justify the play.
>Margaret_Sutherland: BEW 4C WEB +20 303
>Brett_H: DEEOQTT L8 TOTED +18 399
#note  not a great play here.  I have some real potential to be screwed with the Q.  TOD @ 3B is good because it gives me options if I draw an A, I or U.  I played TOTED cause I wanted to cutoff big plays on the triple with the F or B.

>Brett_H: AABEFGR 7C FEAR +28 438
#note I still don't know how to interpret Q sometimes.  It says "best" by my play, but EAG(ER) is higher.  EAGER is a cute play that sets up a big nearly unblockable BARF, but I really liked FEAR when I saw it.  If it didn't give a T hook for a comeback it would probably easily be best.
