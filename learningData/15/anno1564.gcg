#note Slightly behind dumping the Q. I hated blocking the only vowel on the board, but I suppose another one is coming.

#note CP’s fourth choice. Had I considered (W)OOF, I would have played it, but for some reason all I really thought of there was (W)OAD.

#note Weak, which I knew at the time, but couldn’t come up with FICIN-10B or FINI(TO)-K2.

#note For all the proof you’ll ever need that Championship Player’s verdicts should not be taken as gospel if the results are within a few percentage points, consider choices 2 and 3 of its report: G7 I(T) 49.50%, 7G I 46.6%. It favors (Z)I(G) slightly over I(T), but not beyond the margin of error. I thought it was worth giving up 10 points to greatly increase the chance a bingo next turn wouldn’t go the way of all nongos.

>Kelly: EINORST F1 NORITES +63 336
#note I agonized over what bingo was least likely to open up a big comeback play, and as you’ll see soon, I chose incorrectly here. CP wants to play it 9A.

>Kelly: CEGHILY 1A LECHI.G +51 387
#note CP gives HYE(N)IC the nod by a healthy margin over the next choices, including (T)ECHILY, LICHE(N), (T)ECHY, and the one I played. Next time HYENIC comes up, I might actually know it. I guess since you aren’t likely to go out in one either way, take the points and dump the Y.
