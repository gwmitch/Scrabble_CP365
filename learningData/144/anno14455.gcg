#note Strongly considered THE 9H to set up REV. I'm glad I didn't because he had the X. Q likes ETH 7G by about a point.

I held this for a while. I was about 70% sure it was phoney, but I had my big J play and I really couldn't stop Chris from bingoing next turn. If I were 100% sure, I would have challenged it off.

#note Not thrilled about holding GT, but every other option sucks. GAT 9I may have some merit since there are only 4 Es left and I have one.

#note Cmon scrabble, this isn't fun anymore, let me bingo
>Chris_Cree: ?AEIKLN 5B fANLIKE +75 358
#note I said let ME bingo, not him
>Matt_Canik: LNSSSTU 15B UNS...... +15 225
#note He held this for a while. Q doesn't like this very much, but I don't want to block the BEGS line.

#note Stop having all the bingoey tiles chris, I just want like one or two of them :(
>Matt_Canik: AGIRSST K2 TA.G +10 274
#note I bet I draw the Q here because I played TANG and not TING
>Chris_Cree: AENOZ 4A ZONE +53 474
#note Chris later grumbles and calls himself an idiot when he can't out-in-one next turn, which makes me think he missed ZONAE in this spot. 
>Matt_Canik: ILQRSST A1 RIT. +39 313
#note Yeah! I did draw the Q! I'm psychic or something, right?
