#note All of these plays are within 1-2% of each other...I hate keeping the U but this scores well and shuts off the last bingo lane, and I have the blank. I'm worried about that T, because if he bingoes, it's over, and if I have the blank on a closed board I have a good chance. Quackle says keep the P for 3 less, but I stand by my play
