>Matthew_Larocque: AEIJRRS 8G JAR +20 20
#note Actually this is even more shameful than the Danny game. But if I ignore the obvious stupid mistakes I can still talk about the rest right?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: RY 8G ...RY +15 15
#note Right off the bat I don't like this, but it's only 15 points and Siri knows enough words that he probably wouldn't play a phony here right? Wrong. I have to stop assuming people won't play phonies and just challenge when that feels like the right thing to do.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIISUZ J8 .AZE +33 53
#note This is strange, beause I thought I saw AZU(R)E. Maybe I looked through the other R and ignored the obvious one? But that seems preposterous. IZA(R) keeps the E and isn't so dangerous.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AELMY 12I MEALY +34 49
>Matthew_Larocque: DIIINSU 13H NIDI +29 82
#note At least I was able to score again off the Z.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ITTW K4 WITT. +22 71
>Matthew_Larocque: AIIRSTU 6K .UI +3 85
#note Not really that clear cut - playing off AI for more points is about the same in the simulation, although I liked creating another S-hook.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DNO 9F NOD +18 89
>Matthew_Larocque: AIRRSTV 3K TAV +24 109
>Matthew_Larocque: AIRRSTV --  -24 85
#note Even if this was a valid play, it's still lagging behind a few other plays like TRIV(I)A which I missed and VAIRS for 26 which I didn't even consider. VAR(Y) is one of the first plays I saw and sims well too, so I really did waste a lot of time here for nothing.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ALN K10 AL..N +25 114
#note Ok this isn't even a word either. I know ALANE but this I wasn't as sure about. My rack seemed like it had the potential to bingo soon so I just let it go, but seriously challenge some words Matt.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIRRSTV 10E VAT +22 107
#note Basically the same as last turn, but I still opt to not play VAR(Y) for some reason. This kind of encourages a closed board also and I need to keep scoring.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EORW L1 WORE +32 146
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIORRS 1L .AIF +30 137
#note FARRO(W). And it's not even close, my play sims a distant third. I couldn't be sure it was a word, though.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EHSU 15H HUES +27 173
#note Okay Siri is probably silently laughing his ass off right now. Even if this was a word, it sure doesn't sound like one that would take an S, and I know ALANE doesn't. I held for a decent chunk of time and then I don't know I decided I'm not really that far behind or something. Isn't this getting a little out of hand I mean half of Siri's points aren't even from real words. But generally when I fail at scrabble I like to go above and beyond expectations.
>Matthew_Larocque: BNOORRS 2J BO.RS +32 169
#note I forgot that BROO is a word. Again. But it does a little worse in the sim than BO(O)RS.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EE M11 E.E +12 185
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINOQR 3I QI +25 194
#note If I had an S here, I'd probably opt for the other QI.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DIIN 4F NIDI +18 203
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGNOOR 14B OREGANO +76 270
#note How can I miss 1D?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EG E10 .EG +14 217
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDGLTU C12 BU.G +14 284
#note Didn't see BU(N)DT for some extra turnover.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EINOOST 3A TOONIES +71 288
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DKLMRT M5 M.LK +11 295
#note Well that's not good. I really wasn't feeling good about this play either. I'm pretty sure I saw the K(EN) spot too, MiLK for 43 is probably worth it. And D(O)RK because the M isn't really that bad.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EX 8M .EX +42 330
#note Yep.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DHLORT D11 HO +27 322
#note Didn't know the bingo here, but I somehow only see OH 2E and not plays like LOTH or DOTH. Then I just play here cause I can't make up my mind. God this game sucked. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AV A1 VA. +18 348
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADLRTU D1 De.TURAL +72 394
#note This is actually the only bingo availible, so it's pretty cool that I was able to get it down. But uh, the other blank is unseen, so you know this could end badly. Indeed the best simming plays are holding off on the bingo. LU(X) or TU(X). But am I really skilled enough to pass up the bingo here? No I'm not, so I just bingo and do the finger cross.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?CEPPST 6B Pe.CEPTS +71 419
#note Oh well it would be kind of criminal if I somehow won this game anyways. But I was 0-3 on day 2 which was reeeeally disheartening. And because Edmonton doesn't have a lot of active players, there was only 3 of us in divison 1. I felt like I had to put on a good performance and I didn't exactly do that.
