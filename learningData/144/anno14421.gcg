>Mike_Ryan: ?AABGNS 8C ABASiNG +74 74
#note My record is 5-7, so I really wanted to win these last two games. Mike opens with a bingo and blocks my own bingo. Not good!
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEENOW 9C WED +27 27
#note OWED is a little too easy to use.
>Mike_Ryan: IQ 7G QI +43 117
#note >_<
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINOV E5 INV..ED +48 75
#note Yay!
>Mike_Ryan: AELOY 10D L.Y +19 136
#note Mike almost blocked my bingo again, exposing the vowels here. To my relief he changed his mind.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNOSU 5C UN.ONISE +58 133
#note My winning chances are still fairly low but this helps a lot, as long as Mike doesn't crush that hook too badly.
>Mike_Ryan: ACHOP 4H POACH +41 177
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGIOT D1 BOGA. +22 155
#note Mike's play has made the board hard to bingo on, so I have to play aggressively. Sim likes GOBA(N) a little better here.
>Mike_Ryan: DELOT 1D .OLTED +27 204
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIMSTT 7A TIC +19 174
#note I came really close to cashing the S here, but it didn't seem like quite enough points and also doesn't make any new openings. However it fares much better than TIC in the sim. However, even MI(C)S only has 32-33% winning chances, while TIC is at 28-29%.
>Mike_Ryan: AKNR A7 .RANK +27 231
>Matthew_Larocque: EFMRSTT 2B FR.M +22 196
#note This sims best but now I am sitting at 26% chance to win. Looks like I'm going to need the blank or a high scoring bingo.
>Mike_Ryan: EEILM 2I ELEMI +12 243
#note Weird choice, he can block this without giving anything back.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIOSTTY 1K YETIS +39 235
#note Haha, sim is actually going for YETI to set up the hook. Maybe if both blanks were out, I would do that.
>Mike_Ryan: IOP 3M POI +20 263
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHJOTT 1A JO +32 267
#note This was good timing because of how difficult it is to score on the board now.
>Mike_Ryan: AIT B10 AIT +15 278
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEHSTT 5L AT +7 274
#note He just opened up an S hook, so I make another play to set up more hooks. Sim came up with (O)ATH to score 15 and create two possible bingo lines. I like it.
>Mike_Ryan: EW 12B .EW +12 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHILST 13C HELIAST +89 363
#note But keeping the H ended up working out.
>Mike_Ryan: NU M5 .UN +4 294
>Matthew_Larocque: FO 14E OF +28 391
#note Even if Mike has the blank, I think I can just outscore his bingo now.
>Mike_Ryan: EEGZ 8L GEEZ +52 346
#note Didn't see that coming, though.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORRV L8 .RAVED +22 413
#note ORRA 9L! That looks so awesome too. I didn't know DOR(S)ER.
>Mike_Ryan: ?RRUUX B6 X. +25 371
#note His best play is Ro(U)X for 31.
>Matthew_Larocque: OR M13 OR +10 423
#note 6L O(U)R is 11.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?RRUU) +8 431
#note 6-7 now.... but I'm worried because in the past, final round games have often been among my worst.
