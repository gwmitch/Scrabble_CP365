>Wesley_Yocom: EGV 8G VEG +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGOOTY I5 DOG.Y +17 17
#note This placement could backfire, but since I am 4-7 at this point being aggressive can't hurt me too much.
>Wesley_Yocom: ?CESTTX 6H C.nTEXTS +68 82
#note And he does have the X! If I were him I would have passed up the bingo without a second thought. Indeed the sim values EX at about 81ish compared to 65ish for the bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIOTU M3 FAU. +28 45
#note FOETU(S) and FIE(S)TA were the plays I was trying to find, although my choice actually fares pretty good. He just drew a random rack, so maybe he got unlucky and cannot make good use of the S.
>Wesley_Yocom: AQT N2 QAT +31 113
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILOST K4 HO.LIEST +94 139
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILOST --  -94 45
#note If I had thought about this for two seconds I would have realized how nonsensical it sounds. To be fair, I did get away with *VASTLIER but that had to be a onetime fluke. I did see EOLITHS here and I reasoned that it probably won't get blocked because Wes probably doesn't know the word. So I tested the waters with this higher scoring play.
>Wesley_Yocom: EINV O1 VINE +45 158
#note Ouch.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILOST J9 EOLITHS +75 120
>Wesley_Yocom: EIZ -  +0 158
#note Wes challenges because if it was actually a word I would have played it the first time. Yeah that makes sense.... if you're facing someone who plays logically... most of my gameplay choices have no logic behind them whatsoever!
>Matthew_Larocque: DILMOWW 15E WIDOW. +39 159
#note Lucky to dump most of this trash for 39.
>Wesley_Yocom: EIZ O6 .IZE +39 197
>Matthew_Larocque: AELMMOR 12E MEMOR.AL +76 235
#note Almost didn't see this, a key find that gives me the advantage.
>Wesley_Yocom: AEKR 14D RAKE +42 239
#note Smells like a set-up, but maybe he doesn't know CRAKE.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACENRRU 11B CURARE +30 265
#note There aren't really any good plays that use the hook, even though he might challenge. Need to just score points. I was concerned that this play turned over too much and a didn't keep some semblance of control over my next rack, but when the board is this crappy it's not really that important. If I had known CRURA I'd probably play it instead.
>Wesley_Yocom: ABO C13 ABO +21 260
>Matthew_Larocque: EHJLNOP N9 HOLPEN +31 296
#note Yeah....I really was too afraid to play PHENOL because I wasn't sure. I phonied with *CRENOL in a game before this tournament, and that added to my confusion. I saw JO 10E but not JOHN in the same place.
>Wesley_Yocom: EIU K5 E.UI +8 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AFJNNRS 10E JAR +34 330
#note Phew.. this spot stayed open for my J. O13 RAJ scores the same, but putting it here makes it really hard to get the board open.
>Wesley_Yocom: ANSU O12 ANUS +24 292
>Matthew_Larocque: FILNNOS L8 FON +19 349
>Wesley_Yocom: EIOPT H1 POETI. +36 328
#note Nice find by Wes.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DILNRS 3B ReDLIN.S +70 419
#note But the timing was all in my favor after this draw. I saw after that I could have played ISLaND(E)R for more points. Or the kind-of-obvious bLIND(E)RS - I didn't know fLIND(E)RS.
>Wesley_Yocom: ABDEINT D1 BI.ED +24 352
#note He didn't know my out.
>Matthew_Larocque: GIY B1 GY.I +16 435
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ANT) +6 441
#note This is my 4th win in a row against Wes, after being down like 1-7 or something ridiculous. It's nice to turn things around after bad luck/bad playing against the same opponent.
