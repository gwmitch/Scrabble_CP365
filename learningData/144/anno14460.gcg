#note Chris told me this was her rack after the game.

#note Q suggests B(I)N, but I didn't like what happened if I didn't draw a vowel. I guess on this board it's ok to score almost nothing for a 2nd turn. 
>Pat_Barrett: DM D9 D.M +10 59
>Matt_Canik: EENNOST 9B NO. +11 77
#note I really wanted to try walling her in with something like ZAS/S(O)N, but I felt like this was better.

#note LIEU 14L was another option I considered, but I didn't think it was right to start shutting down when the 7 row/J column were still open, so I ran with the equity. 
>Pat_Barrett: AHM 14J HAM +35 152
>Matt_Canik: AACEOSU O8 OCA +17 187
#note I had no idea what to do here, I know this sucks, but everything else did too. Maybe I should have just traded 3?
>Pat_Barrett: APT 7A APT +20 172
>Matt_Canik: AEOOOSU -AOOOU +0 187
#note Yep I just drew the last three Os. All of them. On a three-tile draw. 
>Pat_Barrett: BGL 12L GL.B +20 192
>Pat_Barrett: BGL --  -20 172
#note Walking back from the computer, Pat started my clock before either of us were seated at the table. She hadn't even taken the tiles off of the board, and my tiles were still face-down. I wasn't in time trouble or anything, but that's blatantly against the rules. I didn't say anything about it because I didn't want to be that guy, but then Pat called an opponent about a clock rule later. I'm not letting that fly again. 
>Matt_Canik: EEGPRSY I8 P.GY +24 211
#note POGEY is definitely better here. GOY might be too.

#note Knocking out the O spot seems important, but there isn't too much aside from WINE/WITE/WIRE/QI that play there. I don't know what the odds of her having one of those are, and even then, I'm only down ~10 after those. RIN or CRUR(A)/CURR(A)N are the only things I can really play there. Thoughts?

#note I win 90% of the time after this play...
>Pat_Barrett: EEORRTT 3C ROTTE.ER +70 396
#note But not this time. 

Definitely not bitter about this loss. 

On second thought, yeah I'm a little bitter.
