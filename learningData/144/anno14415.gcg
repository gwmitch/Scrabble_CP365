>Norm: ?AACDFO H5 FADO +16 16
#note Nice opening play - FAD is much worse because the O doesn't worth well with the A.
>Rafi: AIIIMOZ 7F OI.IA +8 8
#note ZOA to the A scores 32 compared to only 8 for OIDIA, but the potential of AIIIM is terrible compared to the potential of ZIM with the chance at a huge ZA play for 60+ points. If ZA is blocked I can still use the O to score over 30 points with my Z.
>Norm: ?ACGPT J6 C.P +13 29
#note Couldn't read your handwriting here on the last tile. Either way, it's worthwhile to get rid of your only vowel to score an additional 10+ points with PAC or PACT (creating PA two directions). A good vowel/consonant ratio is important for bingoing, but 10 points is a lot to sacrifice. The G is also a pretty clunky tile... it is good for -ING plays but not much else. COG is a stronger play than PAC for that reason.
>Rafi: IIJMPRZ F6 Z.RI +33 41
#note I missed a better play here - CAPIZ for 38 points. Depending on your next play, an A draw could give me RAJ/JO, and an E draw can give me JIMPER/OR on the triple for 62 points! ZORI is a good alternative, but CAPIZ is 5 more points and leaves more potential for next turn.
>Norm: ?AABGGT E9 BAG +16 45
#note Good play - getting rid of the double A and G and scoring decently. No other plays score more unless you waste the blank.
>Rafi: FIIJMOP K8 IMPI +20 61
#note Some other options include JO/CAPO for 25, FOP/CAPO for 21, and FIZ for 15. JO and CAPO leave two I's and awkward letters to go with them, and FIZ scores too few and sets up an easy parallel play above the I on the double letter. IMPI is the best play.
>Norm: ?AADGTX L7 AX +37 82
#note AX is a good play, but TAXA or TAX are slightly better! Remember how I said that G's are usually pretty awkward tiles unless you have -ING? Well in this case, ADGT? (question mark denoting the blank) is pretty awkward - the G does not combine well with other "hard" consonants like D and T. The G does work with the R, L, and N though - tons of GL- GR- and -ING words. So in this scenario, getting rid of the T, which is G unfriendly, significantly improves your bingo chances! TAXA is good because it scores 43 vs. 38 for TAX, and opens a nice bingo lane for you hooking MA. Overall AX is a good play, but when considering the hindrance of the G, TAX and TAXA improve your winning chances.
>Rafi: AEFJOOV M3 FOVEA +27 88
#note I could have played FOVEA making IF for two extra points, but that needlessly opens the triple word score for you. I have a good chance of drawing a J overlap on the double word next to the O in FOVEA.
>Norm: ?ABDGTT 6L T.D +18 100
#note Right idea, but again, getting rid of that G is hugely important. TEG in the same spot as TED is the star play here. TEGG is also a word in case you didn't know.
>Rafi: AHJORTY L2 JOY +41 129
#note Highest scoring play, and AHRT is a great leave.
>Norm: ?ABGKNT D10 KAB +27 127
#note BATIKING through the I plays for 64 points here - but don't worry about missing tough words like this. KAB is a very nice play here... saving the G is better in this scenario because of the synergy with the N. 
>Rafi: AAHIRTW C11 HAW +29 158
#note Highest scoring play (aside from THRAW off the I in IMPI, which opens the triple and leaves the less ideal AI), and AIRT is a strong leave for bingoing.
>Norm: ??GNTTT -TTT +0 127
#note Did you look for a bingo here? I recall you trading pretty quickly. Sometimes in the muck of no vowels and three T's is a bingo like TATTING, TOTTING, or TUTTING (although TOTTING and TUTTING are not super common words). TATTINGS is also a word. By hooking to make BIT, the 7 letter bingos play for 63 points.
>Rafi: AIORTUU 9K .IAOU +19 177
#note This was a pretty tough play for me. I saw OMIT, making TAXA and CAPO for 26 (but leaving the ugly ARUU). I also considered trading tiles here. I suspected that you had a good leave after trading only 3 tiles, which did present a triple-triple threat, although the U isn't the easiest letter to bingo through. I also knew that you didn't leave the Q, because you just exchanged tiles. I think knowing you didn't save the Q makes MIAOU better than OMIT - leaving RUT is wayyyyy better than leaving ARUU despite the sacrifice in points and the opening of a nice spot for you. I am not sure if my reasoning is correct though - this is a tricky position.
>Norm: ??GNRTU 14A RUsTiNG +75 202
#note There is an incredible bingo through the U that isn't a triple-triple... NGULTRUM!!! I'm glad this play came up... I haven't come across NGULTRUM in awhile. We talked about SUTURING already and the importance of checking for triple-triples even with 2 U's (especially with both blanks!). RUSTING making IMPIS is one point fewer and also a better play - it opens up a lot less for me to use. Sometimes a play like RUSTING/HAWS vs. RUSTING/IMPIS could make a huge difference!
>Rafi: CEORSTU A8 COURTE.S +149 326
#note OUTCURSE also plays through the U (anagram is COUTURES). This rack has 3 7-letter words in it - COUTERS, CROUTES, and SCOUTER.
>Norm: DILNNOT 15G OLD +15 217
#note DUNLIN is a good play here, but an uncommon word. Something like DUN or DUNT is better than OLD - with most letters (except for E's and S's) it's generally good to shed duplicates when you have the chance - especially for a similar score. You save a better leave for next turn that way!
>Rafi: EEGHIIL O8 G.ILE +21 347
#note Here's a good lesson on tile leaves - GUILE for 21 is a better play than EH (under MIAOU) for 28 points. Why? Because EHI is so much better than EGIIL - duplicate I's a bad and the G is a bad tile, and the H is a very good tile for making short words for 20-30 points. In fact, I have two separate spots for the H for next turn - OH/HI (using the I in GUILE) and EH (next to COURTERS). These words score 26 and 28 respectively, a nice score on mostly blocked board like this.
>Norm: INNORTT L11 TROT +10 227
#note This is another case of paying attention to your leave - TORN is almost an identical play, but it leaves INT instead of INN. Getting rid of the duplicates is so important!
>Rafi: EEEHILS 15L HEEL +45 392
#note Not much to say about this play... scores well and leaves IES.
>Norm: DINNNRV I13 VI. +11 238
#note The only good play on the board is the uncommon NINON. This looks like an exchanging situation otherwise... VID scores only 11 and what are you going to do with NNNDR next turn? You might draw two vowels, but either way having 3 N's for next turn is just plain ugly. If VID scored 30 points, it would be a different story, but 11 simply isn't enough to warrant playing here.
>Rafi: AEEISTW I3 WEE +15 407
#note With the only remaining T for TWEE and A for AWEE, and given that there are 5 E's and 5 N's unseen, this is a great play for trying to bingo next turn. AIST + EN = SATINE, and you know how powerful that combo can be! Unless you block, I'm probably going to bingo within a turn or two. The next best option is TWAE (bottom right corner) for 10 extra points, but positionally it is weaker and I'm saving an E instead of the final A.
>Norm: DNNNNRS -NNNR +0 238
#note I don't remember what you kept here, but something like DRS, NRS, or RS is a good keep. DNS, NS, and DS are pretty good as well.
>Rafi: AEILSTU 10D ..LE +26 433
#note With all the N's and E's left, I have a good shot at drawing SINUATE/TWEE for next turn. KALE also scores 26 compared to fishing just the U for 2 points (which does increase my bingo chances but also scores nothing).
>Norm: DEENSSY J2 YEN +21 259
#note I liked the gutsiness of this play - opening an E hook with the chance of me playing there. With only 15 tiles unseen and 2 E's in the mix, I probably have an E, but sometimes I'll have a better play on another quadrant of the board! If the score were closer (say you were behind 70 when you played YEN), then a play like this could be the different between winning and losing! You might draw a bingo in that spot and if your opponent doesn't have an E it's hard to deal with. And if you make a play like this with the last remaining hooks on your rack (like my WEE play), then you might be able to steal a win from the clutches of defeat!
>Rafi: AINQSTU H1 QUA +42 475
#note You blocked my QUINTAS/AWEE or ASQUINT/TWEE. QUA for 42 points is still a great alternative though, leaving INST with 3 E's unseen.
>Norm: DEMNNSS F6 .....S +23 282
#note Nice play! BINS/FADOS for 19 is a good alternative, getting rid of one of your two N's.
>Rafi: EEINRST 9A .N +2 477
>Norm: DEMNNNS 10N M. +20 302
#note We talked about this play already - when a good (or even a lower rated) player makes an opening like this in the end of the game, it's usually for a reason. Check the tile pool and if there's a chance your opponent will bingo then you should probably block the spot (unless you don't see a bingo yourself, and have a huge play elsewhere). This is especially important when you are ahead - if your opponent bingoes out then you might lose an otherwise hard fought win!
