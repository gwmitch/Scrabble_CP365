#note Not an ideal leave, but it scores enough more than any other play to be worth it.
>Bob: CEEMNR E5 MEN.CER +44 44
#note I now experience vowel death for several turns that mightily distorts the vowel-consonant balance in a way that affects the whole rest of the game.

#note This isn't exactly safe, but it doesn't make it quite as easy for him to make big scores as ARENITE/RETINAE/TRAINEE at 2I.

#note The upside of drawing all those vowels: Bob now has to deal with nothing but consonants for a few turns.

#note This is a very counterintuitive play when I have XI at 2J for 50.  Not only am I scoring 23 points less, but I'm keeping the X while taking out the best scoring spot for it.  You might disagree, but hear me out on the reasoning.  Thanks to my early vowel heavy racks the bag is very consonant heavy.  If I play XI leaving DLNRS, I am quite likely to draw two more consonants and not be able to score anything decent on the next turn.  Meanwhile, there are still two blanks and three S's unseen, and even with the vowel imbalance, bingos are still a definite possibility from him, especially throught the open I and E, though the TOE hook on 13B is also available.  This move plays to partially block the open bingo lines on the M,N,O columns and tries to beat him in the race to the blanks, while trying to keep myself out of too much consonant trouble.  Meanwhile, though I won't score quite as much for the X as before, I've still got possibilities of EX/OX 1N, XU 7M, and parallel plays putting the X at 13L.  I don't know whether I made the right decision, but it worked well in the game.

#note Given the score and the blanks unseen, it's definitely right to do this first, taking out the two open vowels.

#note I missed some amazingly high scoring plays here: AWHAPES# for 68 and UNSHAPEN for 60 through HAP, and one of my dream plays, NEWWAVER to the triple for 48.  Although all of those expose vowels that he could potentially make bingos with (VOLTAGES, GAVOTTES, GLUTTONS), none of them quite fit.  Notice that the only seven he can make is GLOTTIS, which I am safe from because SOE* is not a word, though if it was, I would have played WINNLES# myself.  Nonetheless, my pedestrian play is good enough.
