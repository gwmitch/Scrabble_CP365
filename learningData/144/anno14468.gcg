#note M10 PION scores OK and also keeps an E and RG for BALLYRAG - clearly better.

#note Maybe a little too cute, but there wasn't a great way to deal with S- sevens hooking SWAB - the game is easily close enough that I could lose if I sacrifice too many points to deal with that threat. EOCENE was the best I could find in that spot but it almost certainly lets Brian go out in two on me. I also have J?ES A1 in reserve if Brian blocks the J setup after HEN.
