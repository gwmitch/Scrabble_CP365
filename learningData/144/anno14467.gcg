#note Preferred this to D10 FATTED, and certainly PATTED in the same spot to avoid the S hook. TAPED/PATED sim better too but it seems like it would be easier to underlap them for big points on row 14.

#note Feeling like I need to get something going on the left side of the board. Doesn't sim horribly which is good enough for me. Edit: I should add that I was expecting a play coming down from the B at O3 to effectively end the game unless I had more legitimate threats on the board.
