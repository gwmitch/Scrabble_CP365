#note F9 BARRAGE might be a little safer because of the underlaps this gives up. Probably worth the 2-point sacrifice.

#note Don't like closing lanes, but this is the best equity by far. And Seth will need to keep it open.

#note Passing up the bingos at 13A to close this scary spot and keep ES?. If I had seen 13B STUPIDEST, I may have preferred that, though.

#note I'm kind of sad that Quackle hates my play so much. I foresaw having difficulty outrunning Seth on a closed board, and wanted to get my bingo down ASAP. This line is fairly hard to close, but maybe I can continue to bide my time and play 6I LEAN? I dunno, I'm still confused why this sims 12 points below that play, because I still think it looks pretty good.

#note SPINELS is probably best. Wanted a play that put a consonant at E4 and a non-S, non-E at E8. Didn't have time to find all the bingoes I guess.

#note Far from the clear-cut winner. WOOING is definitely worth considering due to the vowel imbalance in the bag.
