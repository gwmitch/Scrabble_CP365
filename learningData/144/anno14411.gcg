>Winter: DEEFNPT 6F FET +22 69
>Allan_Simmons: EETW 10G WEET +27 101
>Winter: BDENPXZ 5E ZEP +41 110
#note WTF??? I saw this on my rack, but not on the board. Suckage. At least I was smart enuf to pass on ZEX, which gives up too much.
>Allan_Simmons: AD 11H AD +20 121
>Winter: BDNORSX 11E BRO.. +21 131
#note Saw BRONDS, but had absolutely no idea if it was any good--never seen it. Shoul dhave been more sure of BORD and DORB however.

#note Grrr...
>Winter: DDENNSX L3 DEX +35 166
>Allan_Simmons: HOW C7 HOW +39 245
#note Not good.
>Winter: DIIMNNS M2 NIM +21 187
#note On the other hand, there's an ess hook out there, which means DINS is the right leave.
>Allan_Simmons: EGP B8 PEG +23 268

>Winter: AEKORTV O12 .ORK +33 296

>Allan_Simmons: IR E3 RI. +12 310
>Winter: AEEOSTV 3B OVE.EATS +76 372
#note Another break.
>Allan_Simmons: EILNUV A10 UNVEIL +42 352
#note Game not over.
>Winter: AACILRT 14A .ATRICAL +82 454
#note I'd like to think that if the bag had had 7 or fewer tiles, I'd have been smart enough to just play (I)ATRIC. As it was, I knew there was 8, so the bingo was safe.
>Allan_Simmons: ?AIOSTU 15G SAUTOIr +79 431
#note From my point of view, he had to have the bingo no matter what 7 tiles he had.
>Winter: AEFIOOY 2D OFAY +39 493
#note Misadded the score on FY, as 43, I went with OFAY just because.
