#note Chose this over UNPEN and missed BUNN - thought about playing at 8F instead but lost my nerve, not sure why.

#note I took forever on this turn and considered a lot of stuff. I really need to keep a vowel here.

#note The M can wait, also keeping a vowel is nice.

#note Well, this seemed worth playing but ex DQRW puts me in much better long term position. The lines ROQUE blocks aren't huge threats to begin with and in the case of the N, anything that played from O8 will also play from 15H.

>Will: DDLMRSW E12 S.LD +17 226
#note Guess I gotta stick with this tack now. This did block a bingo, though.

>Will: ADIMRTW C9 DAM.. +25 251
#note I badly wanted to play O7 INDRAW* here rather than open up. Plays with ROQUET are more prudent here than DAMAR as well.
