#note Well I'm glad the play isn't TOFTS, because I hated that. But I botched the exchange. Should just keep ST. I should reconsider my "Never ever ever trade an S." mantra.

#note Seemed necessary at this point. I can maybe be more aggressive, since he's not likely to challenge at this score. Make something up through the P or Y?

#note I'll admit I was getting mad here. Should keep my head in the game and see that 14I LOUIE is quite reasonable. Exchanging isn't bad either.

#note In the short term, this isn't going to bingo very often. But in the long term, I'm probably going to need a line like this open. It's a weird looking play, but it sims surprisingly well, tops in win% ahead of scoring plays like L9 DESK and C11 KNEED.

#note Maybe I was too enamored with this particular leave, but I don't see how the top-simming play K1 DENE is supposed to work. I didn't want to do anything that made it easy for him to play down the L column, thus weakening my bingo lane.
