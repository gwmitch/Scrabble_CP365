#note Dayum.

#note Wow. Can't believe I got away with this, with a 5-pt challenge.

#note Ugh, now it gets really hard.
>Howard_Wilde: EMU M7 EMU +18 356
>Winter: EFGIIOT N5 GIF +15 375
#note This was hard. FET scored 27 , and Quackle prefers FEG (which scores 2 more), but that would have killed me, because Howard had the bingo.
>Howard_Wilde: CEO O3 ECO +11 367
#note This creates an interesting situation, because I assume Howard has the ess, but the only reason I kind of know SECO is because Jayne Mackenzie mentioned it yesterday, and I'm not actually 100% sure it's good.
>Winter: EINORTX 9I X. +34 409
#note Incredibly lucky break, to have drawn the X and be able to leave one in the bag.
>Howard_Wilde: ?EEFIIN K13 .I. +4 371
>Winter: EINORST 2I ORIENTS +74 483
#note I figure I can win anyway even if SECO is not good, because I've got 27 for QUARTOS, but I don't have time to work it all out
