>Joey_Krafchick: AGORSYY 8G YAY +18 18
#note YAY is simming at the very top near GOY. ARGOSY I didn't see but it scores well and bingoes much more percent of the time than other things.

#note None of these bingoes I knew or were in my range :-(

>Joey_Krafchick: EHOOPRS 10C POOH +32 183
#note Wasn't sure about MYC taking an S. POOHS for 44 is the play.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEISTV 11F AVIATES +76 138
>Joey_Krafchick: BEMRRSU 10I BUR +17 200
#note ERB(I)UM for 25 is the play. Mine is OK
>Ryan_Fischer: EKZ L8 ZEK. +37 175
>Joey_Krafchick: EEMOORS 8L .OOM +45 245
#note Before he played this, I was going to play MOROSE at K1. Also, BURK*
>Ryan_Fischer: BDU 2A DUB +16 191
>Joey_Krafchick: EEEJRSW 9L .WE +21 266
#note Quackle says to play JEW at K1, I guess it's good because I'm leaving myself with the tiles to at least play JEERS, but it seems kind of dangerous still. I didn't even consider this at the time, but I would never play that unless it were that many moer points.

>Joey_Krafchick: AEFLNRT 13K ELF +16 345
#note Fa for 28 is simming best by 4%, but with the unseen pool I would be handing him a bingo...this scores well and doesn't give him an opportunities to do anything, and the leave is good.
