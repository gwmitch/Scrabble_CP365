>Matt_Canik: AEEINOP K7 E.PNOEA +18 48
#note This was a really tough turn for me. I couldn't find anything that didn't give him huge responses. I must've spent 5 minutes here before settling on this, which Q has about 2-3 points up on the field.
>Sammy_DO: BIJ 12H JIB. +21 55
>Matt_Canik: AAAIITZ H10 TA. +10 58
#note I liked this play. I set up ZI(T)I while blocking just about any method he has of scoring points. Q likes TIA(R)A 9 points better, though I can't exactly see why. 
>Sammy_DO: BHO J5 BOH. +16 71
>Matt_Canik: AAFIIOZ 5J .AIZA +32 90
#note This and ZI(T)I were both good choices to me, but looking at AAFO makes me a little nauseous. Q likes ZITI more.

#note damn
>Matt_Canik: FGINOST N12 FOG +22 112
#note Set up the S...
>Sammy_DO: ?AEIRTW 15I WARIEsT +87 220
#note Nope
>Matt_Canik: CIINOST O5 S.CTION +44 156
#note INCIS(E) helps open the board up, this is getting really yucky right now.
>Sammy_DO: Y J14 Y. +13 233
>Matt_Canik: CEGIMPR 11C EPIGR.M +28 184
>Sammy_DO: DEEIMST 12C MED +27 260
#note He told me this was the rack after, which means SEEDTIME/ITEMISED were there.
>Matt_Canik: ACEINQU L2 QUA. +26 210
#note Woooow. QUA 13B is risky but I think I've got to take that chance right now. I just didn't see it. 
>Sammy_DO: GIT M1 GIT +23 283
>Matt_Canik: CEEIINN 13C EN +19 229
#note I hope I pull something to the G, maybe? IC(EM)EN makes this game a lot more winnable.

>Sammy_DO: D I11 ..D +8 310
>Matt_Canik: ACEIIRS 10H .I +9 271
#note I want to clean up the rack as much as I can before I open, or at least enough to where I can ACTUALLY threaten to bingo. 
>Sammy_DO: EHNT 14D THEN +17 327
>Matt_Canik: ACEEIRS 6G AER. +4 275
#note Yeah if I don't open now I'm not winning this game.
>Sammy_DO: DK G5 D.K +13 340
>Matt_Canik: ?CEILNS 12A LI... +9 284
#note I'm down to three minutes, but Sam has miscounted 3 plays, so I ask the director for another minute and get it (yeah that's a rule). He'll pretty obviously block this or anything else I open, so I'm just kind of hoping I can draw something through -UT or something. I really don't know. 
>Sammy_DO: LLU A12 .ULL +12 352
>Matt_Canik: ?CENOOS N1 OS +31 315
#note Plan is this then CONgE(E) if he doesn't do anything about it.
>Sammy_DO: EFIRRST F2 FIRE +18 370
#note Sammy laid down STRIFE(D)* and looked about ready to play it, then picked it up and played this. I was so disappointed.
>Matt_Canik: ?CENO 1E CaNOE +25 340
#note I went over my time by :58 but didn't lose any points! Random rules knowledge yeah!
