>Matt_Canik: BDDGRSS -BDDG +0 0
#note What do you keep here? I couldn't decide between RS, RSS, or DRS. I chose RSS, Q likes RS slightly better (0.8 points)
>Darrell_Day: AAEFIRV 8D FIVER +30 30
#note Darrell told me FIVER held AA. 
>Matt_Canik: EERSSUW 7G WE +20 20
>Darrell_Day: AAAAEEL F7 A.A +12 42
#note Then he told me he drew AAEEL into that. So I wonder if he was fabricating these racks to complain or if he really played this. 
>Matt_Canik: EPRSSUW I4 PURES +28 48
>Matt_Canik: EPRSSUW --  -28 20
#note I thought this was good. Assuming it is, Q still prefers WUSS.

>Matt_Canik: EGOSSTT K9 T.OG +10 86
#note Trying to fork the board, GO(A)TS telegraphs an S to him. TOTES I4 might be worth considering. 
>Darrell_Day: CDINOO I2 CONOID +22 175
>Matt_Canik: EMRSSTV 5H M.VER +20 106
#note These two esses are still screwing with me. I never know when to give them up, especially when they're the last two and I have two S hooks open.

>Matt_Canik: DILOSST M3 ODS +26 132
#note LOIDS maybe?
>Darrell_Day: ?ADEEIR 13E READIEs +64 258
>Matt_Canik: GIIJLST 2K JIGS +30 162
#note Aaaand I throw in the towel. Is this too soon to give up? Maybe. 
>Darrell_Day: IX 14F XI +52 310
#note Giving up looks like a fine idea right now though
>Matt_Canik: DILNOOT 12A TONDO +16 178
#note But wait, I can fork and maybe make something happen!
>Darrell_Day: ILTZ 12K .LITZ +50 360
>Matt_Canik: CEGILMT O8 GLIT. +45 223
>Darrell_Day: AKO 11C OAK +33 393
#note From this, I assume Darrell has the blank. He spent about 5 minutes here and didn't block. Darrell always blocks. So he wouldn't leave the 3x3 open without the blank, or at least that's what I think. 

He confirmed this after the game, too. 
>Matt_Canik: BCEEMPR M11 M.B +14 237
#note Pretending to fish while really just hoping for an I for glitzier.
>Darrell_Day: INQU A8 QUIN. +42 435
>Matt_Canik: BCEELPR C10 P..CE +18 255
#note Didn't know BETEL, wow, that's 45 points. 
>Darrell_Day: A 11M .A. +7 442
>Matt_Canik: BEEHILR O8 .....IER +54 309
#note Q says play E(H), block his bingo, then take either QUINTILE or GLITZIER next turn. Nice thinking, duck. 
>Darrell_Day: ?AEHNTU A8 .....ETs +48 490
#note And he misses chaunter. I love watching my opponents blunder as I lose by 150.

But seriously I'm taking the blame for this, I botched a bunch at the beginning by dawdling with two esses and playing PURES.
