>Helen_Gipson: KY 8G KY +18 18
>Winter: EEEGILO I7 GEE +17 17
#note Super torn between ditching the O and giving up a 20-30 point play, or playing defensive and risking vowelities.
>Helen_Gipson: AAAA -AAAA +0 18
>Winter: EILOPTU 10F LOUP +15 32
#note Expect that she drew into a bingo, so try to be defensive. Probably wouldn't have played LOUPIT even if I had known it.
>Helen_Gipson: FL 9I .LF +6 24
#note Oh boy. My bingo doesn't play, and she's sure to hit the S hook.
>Winter: EINRTWY H10 .NWRIT +39 71
#note Wow. Got away with a phony.
>Helen_Gipson: CMR 14F CR.M +14 38
>Winter: DEIIOSY 10K YID +15 86
#note This rack killed my brain. Loathe to leave two Is, can't really block, so I finally settle on pushing her likely bingo out to N and hoping for a counterplay.

>Helen_Gipson: ADH 15D DAH +16 54
>Winter: DEEIORS 12F DO.ERIES +74 160
#note Damn, didn't see OSIERED or OREIDES. Stopped looking once I saw DOWERIES.
>Helen_Gipson: ATV 13M TAV +16 70
>Winter: AEGMOWZ O13 .OW +27 187
#note Quack likes (V)AW.
>Helen_Gipson: GNO G5 GON. +10 80
>Winter: AEGIMRZ F6 ZA +64 251
#note Getting super lucky. Pass on GRAZE and GAZE to be defensive.

>Helen_Gipson: UX J6 XU +28 108
>Winter: EGIMNRT K4 GRIM +29 280
#note The G doesn't seem as risky, and ENT is a good leave with those two open Ds, plus two blanks and three esses unseen.
>Helen_Gipson: ??AOORS E1 SORObAn +74 182
#note It was coming.
>Winter: EEELNNT 1E .TEEL +15 295
#note Don't see ETEN, so I go to block the 2F spot, and obviously to avoid opening lines on the left side of the board. Wanted (S)ENNET but unsure. Maybe my weakest play of the game.
>Helen_Gipson: AHJ D2 HAJ +51 233
#note Well, this is fair.
>Winter: BCENNRS 3C B..REN +18 313
#note Damn, CENRS was the leave.
>Helen_Gipson: IQ L3 QI +28 261
>Winter: AACENST N4 CATENAS +73 386
#note Now I can breath.
>Helen_Gipson: ATV 8L VA.T +33 294
>Winter: DEEILOT M2 DI +28 414
#note Holding on to the L, hoping for an A to hook L(AZO) and A(NAN).
>Helen_Gipson: ABEINSU D8 UNBIASE. +74 368
#note Can never get too comfortable with this one.
>Winter: EEELNOT J11 T.EE +17 431
#note Quackle says LENO is the play, which means I let her have (CRIM)P for 29. I guess, since she scored 29 for FOP anyway.
