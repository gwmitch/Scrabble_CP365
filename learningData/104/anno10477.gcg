>Paul_Holser: DEJOTT 8D JOTTED +44 44
>Jim_Burlant: BCENOPU D8 .UPON +28 28
#note Best, surprisingly.  I thought that perhaps I should have played JUNCO, but Q disagrees.
>Paul_Holser: KPR 11C P.RK +20 64
>Jim_Burlant: BCEHINO C11 .INCH +26 54
#note Considered BINOCHE*, but against Paul that's a non-starter. Q says to simply play 10B BOP, and it doesn't like this much.  
>Paul_Holser: OO 15A OO. +18 82
>Jim_Burlant: ABEFOST 7H FOB +18 72
#note Too bad he didn't hang an F.  This is best, and I'm 45% to win.  But the draw goes downhill from here, and fast.
>Paul_Holser: DELM 9H MELD +21 103
>Jim_Burlant: ACESSTW K4 CAWS +27 99
#note Without a B, H, or N for WEBCASTS, SWATCHES, or NEWSCASTS, this was not exactly the draw I was looking for.  This is best and the game is still a tossup.  But not for long.
>Paul_Holser: ?AGLNST L9 SALTiNG +76 179
>Jim_Burlant: ENSTUYZ G11 YUTZ +31 130
#note A little risky, but how likely is he to have something that can really burn me?  He could just as easily block with AY or some such thing.  This is one of the top 3 choices, and it wins 21%.  Best is apparently 4K CUTEY, which wins 23.
>Paul_Holser: AAMR H12 MAAR +47 226
#note When it rains, it pours.  Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ABEEINS 15L .IBE +21 151
#note Q prefers BENNI; with all those I's and only 2 N's unseen, I'm not going to be so quick to play off the N, even if it does score 5 more points.  This is runner up, and it wins 10% to BENNI's 11.
>Paul_Holser: IWY 11J WI.Y +20 246
>Jim_Burlant: AEEENNS J11 .EEN +9 160
#note I just wanted to dump the clunk and add a handful of points while not shutting the board down on myself.  Q recommends it at 6K; yes, I have an S, but the way this game has gone he probably has one too.
>Paul_Holser: ADIV F4 DAVI. +17 263
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEHNS 4J A.HE +18 178
#note Desperate and probably grooming the rack a little too much.  Best is 4H HANCE.
>Paul_Holser: AIIX E2 IXIA +29 292
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGNRS D3 ER +21 199
#note I'd expected Paul to do something to muck up the M column so my only bingo options would be 8's that slotted the  A column.  IXIA threw the monkey wrench into the works, as it blocked my intended bingo of GRENADES 4A.  I didn't like this when I put it down, but it left a potent combination and opened up the left side of the board.  This worked out...sort of.
>Paul_Holser: AGIQR C3 RAGI +35 327
#note When this came down, I said to myself, "Oh, shit."  Needless to say, we know what's coming on his next turn.   And of all times for me to have a bingo, I couldn't have chosen a worse one.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGNRS N1 GANDERS +83 282
#note Or GARDENS.
>Paul_Holser: IQ B6 QI +62 389
>Jim_Burlant: EEFINOR F1 EF +26 308
#note Q wants me to just play on row 1 (FORGE, FOREIGN, etc.)  , but how am I going to win this game without a bingo?  I haven't given up just yet and the right draw could yield a spread saving out bingo.  Best is apparently 1K FORGE.  This wins 0.
>Paul_Holser: ?ELOOST 1H ThEOLO.S +131 520
#note The other bingo is bOOTLEGS. Fantastic find by Paul!
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNOR -  +0 308
#note I was pretty sure this was good (I don't think I've ever successfully challenged any of Paul's words), but this had to obviously be challenged.
>Paul_Holser: TUUV J3 V.T +8 528
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNOR A7 LEONE +17 325
#note No-go number 3.  And LEONE scores 21 at O5.
>Paul_Holser: UU L3 U. +5 533
>Jim_Burlant: IR N13 RI. +10 335
#note I don't claim I played perfectly, but I also think it's fair to say that there wasn't much I could do about the win.  Yes, leaving the 3x3 open blew the spread apart, but even if I play FOREIGN and play to concede spread, I just don't think I could have won this one.
>Jim_Burlant:  (U) +2 337
