#note I really want to keep a record of this game.  Primarily because I could have won my division with game, and secondly for this to never happen again.  I beat this person by a wide margin previously so they know they have to start off big.  OUTRULE is not valid but I didn't know this...doh!  After this game, I made a conscious effort to clean up my math and awareness of my opponents moves!
