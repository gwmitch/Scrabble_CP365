#note This is an interesting play. The other option, which I missed, was WARKS. WARKS temporarily hurts the bottom left quadrant, but it could certainly be opened later. WAW closes some more immediately good bingo lanes, while keeping good spots for my S. Equity-wise, WAW is significantly better than WARKS. TW isn't that great, but KRST has potential for scoring (HAVENS again, perhaps), and bingoing (if I draw a couple vowels). Still not sure how to compare the two, though they both seem like good plays.

#note Saw PRESTRIKE, but missed PFFT, sadly. Plays I saw and considered were this, PAVE, and TOFF. I preferred this over TOFF because it scored a bit more and partially blocked the HAVENS hook. Is that a good enough reason? I didn't like PAVE because it was far too aggressive.

#note Thought of GRIZETTE*, and the longer the game went on, the more I was annoyed at myself about chickening out on it. Good thing I did! Equity-wise, I could play Z(I)G here, but I'm fine blocking off some lanes down here.

#note Time to finally block off the top of the board.

#note Though it opens some good plays on row 4 and column A, it blocks a lot of high-scoring row 4 plays. Plenty of other options, but I was not thinking much at this point.
