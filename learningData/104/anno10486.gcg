>Brett: ?ADEENX 9G DEXANEs +96 96
#note DEX was the play here, or ANnEXED.  DEXANES is phoney. Maybe I was thinking of DEXTRAN or HEXANE.  I scored it ask 94 while it's actually 96 points.  Mistakes, mistakes...

#note YID was a better play, and I was definitely rushed. The game was scored as a tie, which is my punishment for bad math and that phoney.  Just glad to walk away I suppose.
