#note GALAGO is a 6 I've never heard of.

#note I really like the way this game is progressing- I've got things closed down, she doesn't appear to know how to play closed boards, this looks great. 
>Kristina_Simon: EINY 4H .EINY +24 57
>Matt_Canik: ACEOORU D2 COU.E +16 101
#note Shy away from COOE(D) because it's very offensive. I didn't consider EAU 4D, but I certainly prefer that now. 
>Kristina_Simon: ?EEIOST 2D .OTErIES +63 120
>Matt_Canik: AAIORRT 1H ATRIA +27 128
>Kristina_Simon: PX 3C P.X +33 153
#note Unfortunately, she can still dink with power tiles. 
>Matt_Canik: BEINORR 3L ORB +15 143
#note This concedes the S and Y hook, but only an -SK or -SH word will really sting there, and the odds of that are pretty slim. This wins the sim, due to lack of other options I suppose. 
>Kristina_Simon: HOPS O1 POSH +45 198
#note Plays like this just absolutely piss me off. Dink again. 
>Matt_Canik: DEIKNRS F11 .INK +18 161
#note Holding the S, I like setting up the lane. 
>Kristina_Simon: ADEINRT I8 .RADIENT +62 260
#note Two 35+ point dinks and then RETINA + D ? 
I'm really really mad at this point. Still that doesn't justify what I do here. 
>Matt_Canik: DELRSSU 15D RESUL. +30 191
#note I saw this the next turn. I spent two minutes trying to decide if I would play RUSSLED* if she didn't block, then I see RETINA+D come down and just get pissed. Just... unforgivable. 
>Kristina_Simon: AAFU 13C FAU.A +18 278
>Matt_Canik: DDHLLQS 12H Q. +21 212
#note Consider (RE)L(I)SH/DIMWITS and trading. But I don't want to hold the Q any longer than I need to. 
>Kristina_Simon: CIORUVY K4 .O +4 282
>Matt_Canik: DDHLLSV -DDHLLV +0 212
#note Throw back 6 for the extra shot at the blank- she's blocking so she seems to think I have it.

>Kristina_Simon: AH 7F HA. +17 304
>Matt_Canik: AEINSTU 14I .U +4 234
#note Given the unseens, this appears quite hard to block.

#note Missing the 3x3 was bad. That's all I really have to say about this.
