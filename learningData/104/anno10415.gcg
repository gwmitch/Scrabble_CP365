#note I actually had five As. I don't remember this happening before. I could've just played through, but it seemed wiser to remain flexible with a 100 point leave in case he bingoes.

#note well, shit, this isn't a word. I held but didn't pull the trigger. he's still an underdog but I wish I'd paid more attention.

#note already running verrrry low on time. I'm barely even a favorite to win this game anymore, although if I play MOA which looks best then I'm at 60%.

#note erasion didn't fit but I knew I had him as soon as he played bize because he took a bit to make his decision. AIRN is optimal, this is 8 off if played optimally

#note I did not play this game that well because I played too slow in many places and ran out of time to consider. still, I kept my composure at the end of the game and held on to win.
