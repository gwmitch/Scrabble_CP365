#note This isn't an easy endgame. I have two winning plays. This is not one of them. I blame it partially on the fact that my friend was waiting for me to go, partially on the fact that I had to pee badly, and partially on the fact that it requires a lot of playing out. No excuse for not finding it, but props if you can.

#note (I)R(K) or (K)I win, (K)IR ties (she saw the last one, but was afraid of the C stick. I had the advantage that she was under two minutes here, which made the C more salient on her rack.
