>Opponent: ?AIIMTU 8G MAUT +12 12
#note 10-minute ISC game here, so bingos are easy to overlook. I probably would've noticed MInUTIA if this was my rack, but it depends.
>Richard_Spence: AEMNRST H1 SARMENT. +89 89
>Opponent: ?GHIIOU 9I HOG +22 34
#note OUGH(T) keeps a better leave.
>Richard_Spence: ?GIIQRS 6B SQuIRI.G +71 160
#note The only bingo, which leaves a dangerous E hook.
>Opponent: ?IIILTU -IIU +0 34
#note Decent play, but ILIU(M) scores.

>Opponent: IIJOOOZ C1 .OJO +20 172

#note Best play
>Opponent: AACIOOZ 4B C.Z +28 200
#note I would've at least played COZ C11 39, so that I can rid at least one vowel. Quackle likes AZO C12 29, but it could be dangerous....
>Richard_Spence: AILNNOT 2G N.TIONAL +72 441
#note Missed (M)ANNITOL
>Opponent: AAAIILO 1M AAL +13 213
#note Opponent probably gave up after this point.
