#note I couldn't remember whether it was KAPPA or KOPPA. Fortunately I didn't have to guess. (Both are good, dumbie.)

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACGIMPW J2 CAMPI +32 84
#note S is already strong on this board, so I'm not worried about making it stronger. Plus, nothing is really close to this.
>Adam_Logan: BEJLU 4H JU.BLE +50 132
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEFGMNW 3M FEW +28 112
#note I saw 12A FEW and didn't bother counting it up, I just assumed it was far less than 28. But it's 27. And it weakens that strong X spot. The plays are still comparable, I think. Leaving a hot spot open isn't bad if you're opening more. And at this score, I'm happy with volatility.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EGMNOR 1D MORGENs +97 209
#note I was going to do MONGERs, but realised that Adam probably knows all the extensions to it. Just WAR-, actually.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEEIOYZ N1 EY.D +50 259
>Adam_Logan: AIR 5J .AIR +28 275
#note Volatile board has quickly become quite tight.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DDEINOZ 12C DO.ED +27 286
#note 12 points is a lot to give up (2A DOZED). But man... DOZED looks like suicode. AAAAA unseen... it just seems like I'll give those points back every time. I was actually tempted to hang onto ZO and leave the spot open to fish for E10 AZON... but it seemed that this spot was likely to be taken. And I can actually still draw an A and play AZON for 30, which is nice. Anyways, it's not like keeping the Z is super strong on this board. It's alright, but DOZED still feels wrong to me. After a long sim the plays are tied.

#note Lucky.
>Adam_Logan: HILOOT 11G OOLITH +21 314
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEINSST M7 ENTASIS +78 401
#note Jeez, I looked at HNSSTAEI for awhile and only saw three... I missed ANTHESIS. This is probably still the play, though. Seems it will make it tough for Adam to bingo back.
>Adam_Logan: AUV 7K UV.A +7 321
#note This is a nice play. Doesn't make it easy for me.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEOORRT N9 OE +10 411
#note 3B AERO loses to the worst case scenarios (ISOLEAD, ALOETIC, etc.). I don't think I can safely empty the bag here. This play sims to the top with 97% to win. I don't see how it can lose, considering Adam needs a large bingo into a triple lane to win, and I can block setups into column A.
