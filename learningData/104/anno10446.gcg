#note I thought this was good because I would get ?OO? plays at A12 sometimes, but CP prefers D10 APOGEE.

#note Champ favors M11 GEE, but it looks like that loses almost every time to 'optimal play.' OGEE appears to win slightly more often, but the best option is to take the highest scoring play available right now.
