#note whoa, if I win this I go 6-0! he told me some of his racks
>jd: EGIIRTT 7F TI.G +8 8
#note I know from recent painful experience that titering* is not, in fact, a word. it seemed like a bad idea to try it again. this is a serious misjudgment - TING encourages him to hook on column J and block all my lanes. my leave still only bingos about 40% of the time next turn anyway, so playing something like GAIT that's more defensive sims better.
>Peter_Armstrong: NPRRSTU 4H .RUNT +12 30
#note also his actual rack.
>jd: DEIMRTY J6 DEMY +20 28
#note deity is not really that hard of a find, but for some reason I just could not see it here.

#note there are no standout options here. since spread doesn't matter I figured I would just try to make the board as open as possible. LOP takes out my best hope of coming back in this game.
>Peter_Armstrong: EOW A7 WOE +31 210
>jd: ADIIORS O7 AROIDS +35 104
#note a further lack of good options, this looks ok but I should have played radios. wadi looks like a potential upgrade too.

>jd: ABEEEIS N10 BE.IE +39 143
#note I would like to keep the 3x3 open, but this actually does accomplish that to a certain degree
>Peter_Armstrong: AQT 13G QAT +30 292
>jd: AEISTUY J14 YA +28 171
#note maybe just playing estuary right away here is better. I didn't see it. I wanted to slow the game down.
>Peter_Armstrong: EEEJNOZ 11D JEON +38 330
#note his actual rack

#note I was trying to make my rack as flexible as possible and praying for something through the AR or a 3x3 up top
>Peter_Armstrong: CCDEI 1B .ICCED +14 384
#note interesting play
>jd: ?HIKLNS 4A H.LK +30 294
#note I was way low on time but I should've seen one of the huge plays of larkish or shark. though he will block the lanes, shark sims as having a 23% win percentage! shame I didn't look there.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?ABEGMO N2 GAMBOlE +79 463
>Peter_Armstrong: ?ABEGMO --  -79 384
#note he kinda knew this wasn't good but wanted to make me burn time thinking about it
>jd: ?AILRSV 14D .A +11 305
#note with perfect knowledge of his rack I get to fish for either of the two tiles in the bag. but then again, I missed revisal which is pretty dumb. I really wanted to fish for a 3x3 at the bottom-right but it turns out none are available. I should just take the bingo.
>Peter_Armstrong: ?ABEGMO 15G EMB..GO +42 426
#note he should fish in turn now, says quackle. will that really work? this seems fine.
>jd: ?ILRSUV N1 SURVeIL +74 379
>jd:  (?AN) +4 383
#note well, at least I kept it interesting. demy was a bad error. tinge was a subtle play that I screwed up.
