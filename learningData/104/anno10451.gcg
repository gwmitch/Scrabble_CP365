>Matt_Canik: AILLOSY F7 O.LY +15 15
#note Yup. Saw SAILORLY and decided I was for sure making it up. This held SONLY, which I liked.

#note Spent a long time on this rack. H1 is a scary bingo line, one there could score a lot. (R)AZE E10 looks solid and holds DEIR, but I, for whatever reason, decided to score as much as I can to brace for the bingo I know is coming. Not smart.

#note I looked for a ?A?O spot underneath crazed for a while. Didn't think about A?O?. Spent probably 5 minutes on this rack before deciding 'fuck it' and throwing this down.

>Matt_Canik: AAGMNNO 14K GAMA +36 275
#note Sets up two yummy S hooks with three esses unseen, but it scored 36. In hindsight, so did d12 gama.
