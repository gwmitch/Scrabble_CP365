>Jim_Burlant: AEHMOTU 8D MOUTH +26 26
#note Best is 8d MAHOUT, which I didn't know.  This is roughly 5 points down.
>Brian_Whitt: ACDIT E5 DAC.IT +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AAEFRRR F2 FARER +25 51
#note Well, that didn't take long for my rack to go into the tank.  This is best. Hopefully turning 5 tiles will help me here since an S or a Y would go really nice on that juicy spot at 11E that he just opened up.  
>Brian_Whitt: ADDX 3C ADD.X +44 62
>Jim_Burlant: AAFHJLR D1 HA.J +38 89
#note Rather annoyed to have unloaded the F on the last turn and have the first tile out of the bag be the other F.  If I had to draw clunk, couldn't I have drawn the Y instead of the F?  Anyway - this is best, nothing else worth consideration.
>Brian_Whitt: ISW 11C WIS +32 94
>Jim_Burlant: ADFLRTU 5E ..FAULT +22 111
#note This is where this game really began to get irritating.  It's one thing to not land a low-probability tile like an S or an even lower-probability tile like the Y.   Now he's made his second straight dangerous opening that I can't do anything about and I have to sit and play for peanuts with this, which Quackle agrees is best.
>Brian_Whitt: EU 2F .EU +15 109
>Jim_Burlant: BDNRSVY D11 .VY +18 129
#note So of course, now that DACOITY is no longer a possibility, I draw the Y.  Anyway, this is best statically but not in the sim, which wants me to burn the S with L1 RYNDS, which I didn't see; I was blinded by the VY combination.  RYNDS wins 53-1/2%; while this wins just over 50 and sims 3-1/2 points down, the sim is right - RYNDS should have been the play.
>Brian_Whitt: IQ B10 QI +38 147
#note The question I was asking myself:  Is there ANY justice?  Not so far today, from what I can tell.
>Jim_Burlant: BDNPRSS I4 B.RDS +21 150
#note Couldn't think of BUNDS and didn't see BURPS.  This is the right idea with the wrong execution, as those 2 plays are better due to leave, but it winds up not mattering.  Regardless of which one of those I put down, I get my bingo on the next turn.
>Brian_Whitt: OOZ 13A OOZ. +32 179
>Jim_Burlant: ?ENNOPS L2 PENSiON +80 230
#note The only other bingo is K2 PENTOSAN.  When this came down, I thought that, maybe, finally, I'd broken the stalemate and that I could get going.  I'm 70% to win in a short sim.
>Brian_Whitt: ?EEILNR K7 LIERNEs +66 245
#note So much for a game in which I'm in the driver's seat.  Scores 71 at M7.  
>Jim_Burlant: CELMRRT A12 C.RM +33 263
#note A little worried about a 1G play, but I thought that would be difficult to hit and that I'd worry more about balancing my rack.  With all the AEIN unseen, ELRT  could easily give me an 8 on rows 10 - 13.  Q agrees with me - while MERC/MERL 1H are strong choices, this play gets the nod in the sim.  I'm 62% to win.
>Brian_Whitt: EEKN 1G KNEE +44 289
#note When it's not your day, it really is not your day.  This was just about the only rack that could have punished me there, and he had it.
>Jim_Burlant: EEELRTU 2J RU.EE +22 285
#note Luck takes many forms...and one form of luck is that the game clinching bingo that shows up in your rack is within the scope of what you know.  And this was an unlucky break for me, as there's an 8 in here that I'd never seen.  The 10585 probability MULETEER scores 83 at 15A and wins 82%.  The sim verifies that this is the best non-bingo option, but with this pool it was pretty much now or never.  This cost me the game.
>Brian_Whitt: AGW 1M WAG +28 317
>Jim_Burlant: EIIILPT 1A PIT. +27 312
#note 12H PILEI wins 24%.  This is a very close runner up. I figured that with only 2 I's left in the bag with AAAOOOO still unseen, it would be enough to unload 1 I.
>Brian_Whitt: BVY 12J B.VY +24 341
>Jim_Burlant: EIIILLN A1 .ILI +7 319
#note I guessed wrong.  I thought this kept things more alive than HILI H8.  Sim results indicate this comes down to personal preference as to which I dump to put down, as nothing scores squat.  Q wants me to play A1 PILEI and ditch my E; I think it's more likely that he's got one or both of them than Quackle does.
>Brian_Whitt: AA 9G AA +11 352
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNNT M11 T.IN +14 333
#note This is round 3, and to this point in the tournament I've played a total of 3 bingos, and have as many no-go's as playable bingos.  This is the 4th one in 3 games.  Couldn't think of TYNE, which would  have been better.  But it wouldn't have mattered except for spread.
>Brian_Whitt: GOO 15M GOO +21 373
>Jim_Burlant: EEGILNO 10E .IGON +18 351
>Brian_Whitt: AEOST B4 TOEAS +9 382
#note Obviously, this game came down to not knowing MULETEER.  If I find that, this is probably my win.  Winnable for a better player, but not winnable for me.  Frustrating.
