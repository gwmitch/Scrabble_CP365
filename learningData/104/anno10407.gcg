#note Definitely should've exchanged... I'm not setting the Q up at all, and I'm just asking to be hit on row 8.

#note Yeah, I know it.

#note Kind of a bizarre situation here. After praying for an S on the draw, I was delighted when the first letter I turned over was an S... and then I got two more. With no play at 11K, this decision became more about what I was trying to represent I was holding. I thought that this play, even though it makes it clear that I'm holding another S, might give the impression that I'm clearing out duplicates and opening another lane in preparation for a probable bingo next turn, so hopefully she'll be less likely to try to muck up the VICEROY-S spot. I also wanted to keep the M since there's 16 unseen tiles for either SWAM, SWIM or SWUM. Anyway, H12 SERS is a much better way to accomplish everything I was trying to do, but I didn't notice it.
>Sue: FOST H12 SOFT +34 140
#note She could've played SWOT here; I'm not sure if she missed it or felt she needed to get the F off the rack.

#note M7 VUM by a mile. I didn't notice the hook. The only advantage to this is that I'm holding the blank and VUM isn't very open.

>Bill: ?AIMNPT -  +0 306
#note Lost challenge. Neither this nor BUTTIES looked familiar. I considered backing off the challenge, but I figured (if I lost) she'd probably take the triple and leave me the remaining lane for my bingo.
>Sue: DGIN O1 D.ING +33 260

#note Wasn't 100% on TIMPANA.
>Sue: IZ H1 ZI. +36 296
>Bill: AAHKOUU D1 HA.KU +32 411
#note I figured this was safer than HAKU with a strong pool and row 5 open, but actually this allows bingos significantly more often (AACELNT, AACEELT and AACEENT vs. just AACEENT after HAKU). Quackle mocks my puny human brain for not seeing all the possible plays.
>Sue: AACELNT 1A EAC. +27 323
#note She had LACUNATE/CANULATE available.

Find my best play?
>Bill: AEOU 4D .UE +15 426
#note I felt pretty sure I had found the best sequence. Trick question, there was no sequence, just ZOUAVE and out. Aaargghh (-26).
