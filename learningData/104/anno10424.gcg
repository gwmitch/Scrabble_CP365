>Noah: ?ADNQRT H6 Qu.DRANT +68 68
#note Played here because I could draw QUADRANTES! QUADRANTAL is also good, but I didn't know it.

>Noah: ADEHOOU 10E DOU.AH +20 88
#note Really not sure what I should do here. I kind of like HAO 13L, because it opens up more of the top of the board. That's the kind of proactive thing I need to do to get back in the game.

#note Nice!
>Noah: DEGLTUZ 12D Z.G +26 160
#note Considered other plays, but nothing kept a good enough leave, especially with the Z not being an outstanding tile on this board.

>Noah: ADEKLTU L1 TALUK. +20 180
#note ELAND is the high scorer there, but that doesn't do much for my winning chances. I like the way this opens stuff up. There are other options, but this keeps a good leave and gives access to other lanes that I desparately need. Another good option here is EKED, which accomplishes similar goals.

>Noah: EEILOTU N2 OE +17 197
#note Seems fine, opening more dangerous lines.

#note If you found the best place to fish these tiles BEFORE YOU SAW THIS COMMENTARY, I'll give you a cookie.
