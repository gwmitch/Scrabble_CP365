#note Between FIDO E2 and this, I prefer this. I didn't know FOETID, but I think I prefer this anyway.

>Matt_Canik: ?DEIITT H11 .IDIE +24 65
#note There's just no explanation for this. I see DITTIEs then start balking on my high prob bingos, and can't decide if it's old grandma talk or if it's a real word, and then whiff TIDIEsT entirely. This is just not ok, and there just seem to be so many mistakes like this from me this tournament.

>Matt_Canik: EEEIIIQ 12C QI +26 152
#note You know you've made a terrible choice when exchanging keeping EIQ sims higher than your play. I guess the thinking behind trade EEII is that a U leads to FIQUE or QUITE D8. And the thinking behind my play is... well.... ok there wasn't any thinking. 
>Orry_Swift: AMNTXY 2A TAX.NYM +54 226
#note I know Orry has been playing phoneys this tournament, and I held for over a minute, but I just don't want to lose a challenge. I mean, I guess he's gonna net a bunch with this rack anyway, but still. I think, before I become a serious contender, I need to learn more words. Because I'm tired of this shit already, and it's happened exactly once.
