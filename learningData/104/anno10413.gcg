#note I could've played my S and just taken the points, but for some reason I liked the bingo potential of BEMRS with a couple of big hooks available. BEMR didn't seem to do much otherwise. quackle actually ranks them very close. on 4-play plying QIS actually comes out in front by a couple of points, but it's hard to know what 4-ply is really saying. maybe it reflects the fact that those big S hooks will stay open?

#note thought about TOOK, thought KAYO was a little safer because it was less likely to lead to a disaster rack. close on the sim. on the other hand, it opens a lane on a relatively dead board.

#note oh christ, this isn't good. I got confused with GELATOS and GELATIS being good and decided that PANINOS*/PANINIS* both had to be good, even though part of me thought SAPONIN was the only word in here. SAPONIN is a little risky though since it sets up some big hooks.
