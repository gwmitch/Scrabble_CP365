>Mike_Early: EIRTUV 8D VIRTU +24 24
#note Mike almost put down the E and pulled it up at the last second.
>Jim_Burlant: GINORWX D8 .OWING +26 26
#note Best.
>Mike_Early: DEEILY I6 EYELID +24 48
#note EDGILY 13B 30 is the sim's preference based on this rack fragment.
>Jim_Burlant: FGLNRWX 11B WR.NG +18 44
#note Saw the X plays and thought I'd take a turn out to try and draw a vowel for an X bomb on row 6.  This didn't pan out exactly like I wanted, but it still enabled me to put points on the board.   Q agrees - this is best.
>Mike_Early: EMOT J4 TOME +27 75
>Jim_Burlant: DEFLORX K3 FOX +46 90
#note Between the irritation over how the tournament was going (not to mention that I somehow missed a single A, E, or O on my last 5-tile draw from a full bag) and my being sucked into Mike's warp speed game, this is where I started to cross the line from drawing badly to playing badly.  FLEXOR H1 scores 77.
>Mike_Early: AEOR L2 AERO +29 104
>Jim_Burlant: DELLRTZ M1 LEZ +56 146
#note For all intents and purposes, the board and draw bail me out of the FLEXOR mistake.
>Mike_Early: DEIPSSU 12G UPSIDES +87 191
>Jim_Burlant: ADHILRT H12 .HAT +27 173
#note Weak. APHID scores 36.  
>Mike_Early: AQ 15F QA. +12 203
>Jim_Burlant: ADILORT 7B DIAL +22 195
#note This is the 4th no-go today.  As for what does play, it's either this or H1 TAILOR.  35% to win.
>Mike_Early: CEHIN B2 NICHE. +28 231
>Jim_Burlant: AABOORT H1 ABATOR +32 227
#note Play incorrectly scored as 29.  Either this or B9 ROWBOAT.  Still 33% to win.
>Mike_Early: EPY A1 YEP +30 261
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKNOR 5B .ONK +22 249
#note This is what happens when you draw poorly for 3 or 4 straight games:  you see a rack with high prob bingo potential and immediately set about grooming it, and not looking for the best play.  AKIN G2 scores 32 and should have been the play.  This is weak.  AKIN wins 36%, this wins 26.
>Mike_Early: EGORU M8 GROU.E +16 277
>Jim_Burlant: AACEIRV 1M .AV +18 267
#note Q likes 14K VARIA both for the points and the extra turnover to get at a blank.  May be right.  This does poorly statically, but as the sim progresses, it does bubble up towards the top.
>Mike_Early: DILMS 14J MILDS +37 314
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEIRT 8K CA.ER +27 294
#note Saw a potential ACIERATE on my rack. Unfortunately, I was so irritated from having had yet another no-go on the previous turn I didn't look at the whole board out of frustration, ignoring the open A on row 1.  I put this down as a last gasp ploy, hoping for a miracle but realistically expecting him to bingo through the R with both blanks.
>Mike_Early: AEIJNOT D1 JETO. +40 354
>Jim_Burlant: ??EINTU O4 INdU.aTE +57 351
#note Surprised to see these in my rack, and shocked that Mike emptied the bag, guaranteeing me the win.  A zillion bingos are available, and the kibbitzer indicates they all score 57 points.    This was easily my most poorly played game to this point, and I really didn't deserve the win.    If Mike doesn't empty the bag and instead plays something like C9 JAR for 40, then any bingo I can put down won't be enough, as my bingos all score 57, which brings me up to 351 and he can out-distance me in the end game.
