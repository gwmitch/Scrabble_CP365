>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEFHI 8F HAAF +20 20
#note Sim says 8G FIE is a little better. Yeah, they're close. I always hate relying on H in a vowel-heavy leave. I'm not saying I'm right I'm just explaining my illogic.
>Deen_Hergott: EILNY 7C LINEY +27 27
#note Held. Can never keep -Y/-EY words straight.

#note Yuckkkkkk I talked myself out of BEMIX. I was thinking of BEFIX*. Geez, my fives are shaky. This error sucks.
>Deen_Hergott: AEW J10 WAE +17 136
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BCGKOOW K9 BOW +31 230
#note I spent a long time considering COW vs BOW. Leave vs defense? I decided it was too early to try and kill the board, especially with several other lines available. Although because of this,  I ended up tunnel visioning on OW words. GOB is the best of both worlds with a bit of a smaller score.
>Deen_Hergott: AINSV L8 VINAS +40 176
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDDGIKO C12 DO. +23 253
#note I really wanted to do A3 DOCKING, but giving up the easy extensions seemed silly to me. I settled on this play because I was afraid of easy points there like MACE or something, and I placed a lot of value on keeping IG (through the N) and CK (synergy) but together they make kind of a gnarly leave. This play sims find and nothing seems to be a clear winner. But if I knew PIDDOCK, that would have been my choice for sure. Kills the board and unloads the clunkers.
>Deen_Hergott: EFRT 6F FRET +38 214
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDGIKLO 5H DICK +27 280
#note What a gorgeous Phonyeez rack with that N open. Anyways, it's between DICK and DOCILE here. I decided I valued the defense highly. Although it's not like DOCILE gives a lot back in terms of strong bingo lanes.
