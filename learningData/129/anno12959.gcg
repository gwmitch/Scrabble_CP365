#note Damn. I missed THIAMINE. I was not thrilled about LITHEMIA after such a short play, but I couldn't spot the top play.
>Lou: EE G8 .EE +19 109
>Will: ABDIJKW G13 JAW +39 112
#note Couldn't decide between JIB and JAW. JIB sets up KA, so it may have the edge.
>Lou: AEINRST O5 ANTISER. +74 183
#note 4 bingos through the A and none of them 9x. Dodged a bullet.
>Will: ?ABDEIK L6 BIDArK.E +66 178
#note Came really close to playing KA, then had a change of heart...not sure why. KA is better.

#note I know this looks weird, but my plan here was to play LUNT, then VIBE, and then fork the board through the V of VIBE to create multiple bingo threats.
>Lou: OY F14 YO +31 319
>Will: ABEIOVX 6D VIBE +28 255
#note Should've abandoned the plan to play VEX and hopefully draw some miraculous BLUNT play.
