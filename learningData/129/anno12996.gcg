>Jason: AAEHLMR K7 HERMA +27 39
#note HAMZA or MACH (which I prefer), I should leave the E hook open since it looks like Jackson is not sure of it.  This is not horrible though as I know the i and e hooks and he may not be sure about them.

#note Oh well, he had farside anyways
>Jason: EINORST 14B OESTRIN +72 174
#note Not 100% on SPECKING plus might be better to leave it open for a desperation play later
>Jackson: CEOR N10 CRE.O +28 285
>Jason: AAEEGVW F2 WAVE +22 196
#note Chose this location to keep it more open.  Either way things are looking pretty bleak, quackle says I have 2% chance to win lol.

#note He's not concerned about the 3x3 so he must have at least 1 blank.  Not leaving the 3x3 open; this scores best anyways.

>Jackson: ?DIQT 5K Q.D.s +28 487
#note He didn't want me to have his blank!

#note Fizzled to an 8-4 record after that crazy start.  Overall rating gain: +2.   Congratulations to all Montreal players (and Ottawa), as we were able to sweep all three division!
