#note Not too excited by my chances to actually hit a bingo that will play after Jeremy's next play, but what else can I do?
>Jeremy: EV E10 .EV +12 51
>Will: ACEIINR 12C CI.IE +20 31
#note Slight mistake not playing CAVIE to keep IN together with an eye towards the open G.

#note Not sure 10 points is worth blocking the D at this score.

>Will: ?BDLTTU E1 BUTT +15 140
#note I thought it would be hard to reach the B from 1A, and that Jeremy's responses would yield new lines. Also doesn't yield the disaster scenario of AX/XU for 50, but those two things together are probably not quite worth 6 scoreboard points.
>Jeremy: AAL 1E .AAL +18 223
>Will: ?DGLSWX 6B W..L +15 155
#note I have too many consonants for WAIL to be best, and when I eventually do get my rack in order, words with S in seventh position don't play down col. A. Sim likes H12 SOLD, 5B WISS, and I11 GLOW better (and exchanging DGLWX).
>Jeremy: AJR 14F JAR +31 254
>Will: ?DDGISX H12 S..D +30 185
#note SIX is probably better - I thought about it, but gave too much weight to retaining the vowel. A lot of slight errors in this one.
>Jeremy: EPR 8A PER. +18 272
>Will: ?ADGINX 2G XI +20 205
#note All the X dumps accomplish slightly different things. I didn't at all consider just playing B8 EX for 9, which hits P?- bingos for huge scores with A, E, and O draws, as well as tons of consonants.

#note Wow.
>Jeremy: BO B10 BO +22 333
>Will: ACEGOOU 4H GOO +16 354
#note Well, CP likes my play best, but damned if I could figure out precisely why. 
>Jeremy: ?EIMNQV 15J .uQ +21 354
#note I was worried about K7 QI setting up VIMEN, but I had blocks ready for it - neither of us spotted 10J UMIAQ.
>Will: ACEHTU 5G TACHE +37 391
#note I realized to my horror after I played this that I could be U stuck. We were both extremely low on time (Jeremy was over).
>Jeremy: EIMNV N8 VIME. +21 375
#note Sticking would bring home the win, but only by 1 point, not enough to withstand the time penalty, and it is a tricky sequence that actually involves Jeremy sticking himself with the V (he gets more points with OHM and GROWN/ERN than by playing just VUM) and then passing 6 times.
