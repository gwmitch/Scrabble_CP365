>Wendy_McGrath: ?AEFLRW 8D FLAWiER +82 82
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFGNO -  +0 0
#note I was actually pretty sure FLAWY was good, but it seemed like one of the words that didn't compare. Not the best way to start a big tournament.
>Wendy_McGrath: IO 9E OI +6 88
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFGNO J6 FO.AGE +22 22
#note Strangely I didn't see OAF for 27, because I know I looked for a pretty long time for something better than this play.
>Wendy_McGrath: ADEIRSU 12F RESIDUA +80 168
#note Ok, now I'm in trouble.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINNPX 11J .X +36 58
#note I'm already down to < 5% chance of winning according to the simulation. XI 13G is another choice that opens something up, but that leave could end up really bad without another vowel. I can't really bingo with -ING on this board unless I get an opening for one though....
>Wendy_McGrath: ?CEGILO H3 LOGIC.zE +60 228
#note >_< 

3 bingos to 0, no blanks left.... I'm basically just a spectator at this point.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGINNP 4E DEP.NING +74 132
#note Oh hey, this is a word. I could still break 300!
>Wendy_McGrath: HOW H12 .HOW +30 258
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEKPRT F2 DR.CK +26 158
#note I wavered between this and CREPT 10B. I didn't want to play through the O in SHOW because I wanted to keep that open. I figured the K was a bad letter to keep if I was planning to try and bingo again so I dismissed CREPT. Simulation likes taking a few less points with plays such as P(E)CK, D(E)CK or (LO)CK.
>Wendy_McGrath: DEM G10 DE.M +23 281
#note This must have been a case of upside-down board syndrome. I wrote down 23 as her score, and do recall her playing the word here forming HM. But I literally never saw the error throughout the course of the game.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENPSTT M6 PATENTS +70 228
#note Nothing to lose here.... she calls a hold.
>Wendy_McGrath: ANNOT 15H .ANTON +10 291
#note Oh geez. She gives it to me! Then she plays this to block I guess. Too bad there's no dees left.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIQUU 3J QUAI +42 270
#note I almost played EQUI(D) here, actually. Sometimes it does pay to spend a little extra time, especially when you're down this much.
>Wendy_McGrath: EHORS 2K SHOER +28 319
#note She told me after she was blocking the QUAI hooks, but she shouldn't have been worrried about that - this play makes things far more dangerous for her.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEINUV O2 .EVENUE +42 312
#note Seriously. What kind of absurd timing was that? This scores double what my next highest scoring play is, dumps VU along with most of the rack. Not only did she bail me out, but now it's turned into an actual match.
>Wendy_McGrath: ABO 10C ABO +8 327
#note This was strange. I'd assume she was worried about the TLS, but it's really not that wieldly of a hotspot. She should just play these letters for more points elsewhere.
>Matthew_Larocque: IIJORYZ 14L JOY +37 349
#note I just have to cross my fingers and hope she doesn't have the S. My hope was that I might draw BIZ 9A or Z(A)IRE after this if I don't draw the S.
>Wendy_McGrath: BI 13N BI +11 338
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMRSTZ O12 M.ST +41 390
#note RIM 11C is clever, setting up ZITS for 59. I saw that I had two places for Z(A)  so I just automatically took the 41 points.
>Wendy_McGrath: AI 11C AI +8 346
#note Again, this play was strange. She needs points!
>Matthew_Larocque: IILRRUZ D10 ..Z +28 418
#note Sim says hold off on playing the Z, but champ says just play (BI)Z.
>Wendy_McGrath: ETY 13C YET +27 373
>Matthew_Larocque: IILRRU 2B LURI. +12 430
>Wendy_McGrath: ALTV 3A VAT +18 391
>Matthew_Larocque: IR 6D IR. +7 437
>Matthew_Larocque:  (L) +2 439
#note Ridiculous turn of events. After 21 rounds this retained the status of high comeback - down by 170, and a swing of 218 points.
