#note Yeah, if you don't see WIKIUP, the alternatives are pretty bleak. i.e., you have to trade. Gotta see plays like that!

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHIOPR L12 OH +20 20
#note There are no good plays here. Between this and the tricky opening rack, I was already down to 18:30 when I plunked this down. This play is okay, but it gives a lot back most of the time. 7G HIE is weird. Maybe 12K YEH to be a little more defensive?

#note Not fantastic, but nothing is great. I am playing kind of fast to try and catch up on time. L7 AKEE is a nice play I missed.

#note Risky, but seemed worth it.

#note Wow, total tunnel vision on this and I didn't even seen O13 JUN. This is still the play though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EHILOOW E10 WOO +23 269
#note I wasn't a fan of the plays that spent the W and H. I wanted to keep one to score next turn. WHOOF was tempting, but I thought it gave too much back. But WOO does, too. Look at how many unseen letters hook OS. There could be a huge score coming down there. I should just take the points for M5 HOW and hope I don't draw all one pointers and vowels.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CEEHIL H12 HI.E +33 302
#note I really wanted to take points wih LECH or CHIEL, but I was so afraid of leaving this spot open. If he didn't draw an M, there is a chance he can't take the spot beside WOO. I am still undecided if I need to go for a bingo, but this leaves options open.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CEGLMR D12 MERC +32 334
#note A crossroads where I need to decide whether to try to race, or bingo. This wins the sim, but it's such a complicated position. I feel like it's really bleak either way. But I can't reasonably try to open up row A until I see more tiles.
>David_Jones: LOV 10C VO..L +11 364
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AEEGIL 15A GLA.E +24 358
#note Happy to see my opponent give me a chance to catch up. This even opens a bingo lane, but mostly it puts me in a position to outrace, if his tiles are clunky enough. If I draw the P for PRETAX I have a real shot. Better than trying to bingo, I think.
