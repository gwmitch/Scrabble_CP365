>collins23: AIOSTUU 14B U.U +12 84
#note AUTO in the same spot is better.
>dewk: ANNSTVW 7G WANT +23 113
#note NAVEW# is the play
>collins23: AEHIOST B10 HOA +33 117
#note A lot of people get this wrong, but EIST is a better leave than AEST.
>dewk: EENQSVV 12A V..E +22 135
#note Maybe trade QVV.  Also, NEVE 6F on the basis that more turnover is better with the Q.  My play isn't terrible.
>collins23: EEILOST K6 ESTOILE +72 189
#note ETOILES fits nicely at 6G for two more points.
>dewk: CEENQSV 10J Q. +31 166
#note This leave is stronger with the N.  Also, I have multiple spots for EVINCES/ENCAVES#. (SAR#)
>collins23: AKNOOSY 6F KAYO +35 224
#note This keeps the board tighter, but I'd take the extra four points for TOKAY.
>dewk: CEEJNSV 12J J.E +20 186
#note Not the one tile draw I wanted.  Nothing better.

>collins23: AABDDTY 14L B.Y +30 331
#note This ends up blocking a big OWLERIES#, but the CSW12 addition ADDY# at 9F is a much stronger play.
>dewk: ?EILORW N3 bLOWIER +69 431
#note That's the best bingo I have.

#note Wow, he had XANTHISM# for 100.
>dewk: ACDFITU 13G TUFA +21 466
#note FUD 9E looks better on the basis of preserving vowels.  Either way, it seems like I should be safe though.
>collins23: ?HMPRST L3 H.T +6 406
#note A nice setup for him that leaves me regretting having played the A and U on the last turn.
>dewk: CDDIIPR E10 CID +21 487
#note If I'd thought of it, PI 2L might have been the way to go.
