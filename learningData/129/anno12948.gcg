#note Very confused here. 3C DARN/NARD crush the sim. They undouble, keep vowels, and still foul up the newly created scoring spot. Looks good to me.

#note The thinking here was to cripple the EKISTICS hook and retain some scoring punch for next/later turns. Sim likes 4L BEND, I assume because I get DIZEN a lot?

#note Very nearly played ICON here...took a more defensive tack. Sims well. I will draw OUZO/OZONE a lot.
>Aldo: DEEINRS 12I RESINED +84 416
#note That's bad
>Will: ?LNOOUZ N10 ZO.aL +66 418
#note It seems very clear now that OUZO is the play - if Aldo does not have a decent play through the E of RESINED i will have a decent chance to hit at least one line, and at least give myself a chance at some endgames. ZOEAL is the best way to ensure that I lose a close game (i.e. it is not correct). I think in this specific situation (EEOU in the bag) I would have been dead after any play to the D down col. O (the only bingo, UNLOOSEN, doesn't fit) but come on, let's try to make the best play.
