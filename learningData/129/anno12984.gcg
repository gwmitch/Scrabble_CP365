#note I don't really like SHH, though I didn't see it. I guess exchanging 4 is safer.

#note dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb. BRIS is best this turn and next turn.
>New_Player_1: GHIW D1 WHIG +41 291
#note WH(I)G for 45 is better I think, even if she has more than one I.
>New_Player_2: BEINRSS 1A BRE. +27 285
#note For some reason I thought the W was more dangerous than the I. And I still didn't see BRIS.

#note Ugh. Bad way to end the tourney. I could have won each game easily, but went 8-4. Not too bad, but it was my choice to annotate my games and see the ridiculous things I missed!
