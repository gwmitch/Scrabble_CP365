>Matthew_Larocque: BCDGTTW -BCDGTTW +0 0
#note Figures, Q wants me to keep C or CT. Whatever, just gimme a blank!
>Noella_Ward: EFY 8G FEY +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINRR 9B RAINIER +67 67
#note Sure why not. But I shoulda played it on top instead since it's a little harder to use the TWS if she doesn't have the B. She revealed after that she had the blank here that could have turned into a B.
>Noella_Ward: ?HNO 8A NOH +25 43
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEHIIR 10G RAIA +15 82
#note I like the H so I'm cool with this.  7C AI sets up HAHA which I think I overlooked.
>Noella_Ward: UUUU -UUUU +0 43
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHIILV 11D VILE +21 103
#note HIVE seemed like it could hurt me too much to be worth it. The board isn't that ripe for scoring after this unless she has a playable bingo.
>Noella_Ward: ?EO D11 .OE +12 55
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIPW C12 WHIG +37 140
#note Missed AW(E)IGH which scores and gives minimal points back.
>Noella_Ward: ?JO 15A JO. +33 88
>Matthew_Larocque: AEPSUUZ F11 .UAU +6 146
#note Maybe I can hit SPAZ or something. If I can dump 2x U, I'm going to need a huge amount of points to make me keep them.
>Noella_Ward: ?MY 7I MY +20 108
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEPRSZ 10A ZEP +29 175
#note At first I played this at 9J, but the 10A spot scored more and didn't give her any easy points.
>Noella_Ward: ?BOT 6J BOT +24 132
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEORSS M2 REpOSES +70 245
#note This was kind of embarrassing. I couldn't come up with anything starting with S here, SEnORES crossed my mind briefly and then I had doubt if I was remembering that correctly. I mean obviously I know StEREOS and SOiREES, but I just wasn't feeling the rack this turn. *insert delayed laughter here*
>Noella_Ward: ?CEP 7C CEP +24 156
>Matthew_Larocque: AGKRSTT 5I KAT +26 271
#note Hoping to cash that S in next turn.
>Noella_Ward: ?AO A10 .OA +13 169
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIRST 8M .EG +12 283
#note Ugh. This is probably the third time I've missed REGISTE(R). I think I'm too obsessed with the RE- prefix, so I overlook it since gister isn't a word on it's own.
>Noella_Ward: ?ACLN D3 LANC. +14 183
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIRST E7 .I. +5 288
#note Fortunately these missed bingos aren't really hampering my odds of victory.
>Noella_Ward: DIQ J9 Q.ID +14 197
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRST 13F .NTISERA +85 373
#note Hey at least I still remember the RETINAS eights! What a fluke.
>Noella_Ward: ?DM -  +0 197
#note She's pretty sure it's a word but I guess challenges out of desperation or something.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFITUUV O6 FU.UE +9 382
#note FUGU is a word, duh. The other plays being suggested such as either of the FUTU(R)E plays seem too reckless when I just need to play defense now. I would prefer to kill this G and dump my Us.
>Noella_Ward: ?DM 11I D.M +15 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNNOTV E2 VINO +22 404
#note VOLTI for 35 - I dropped the ball on the hook for my own set-up.
>Noella_Ward: ?DRW 3K DR.W +8 220
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGLNTT 3C G..NT +14 418
#note Definitely wanted to keep my A here.
>Noella_Ward: ?BELSTX H1 XiS +34 254
#note Dunno why she didn't play down at the bottom. Also, B(R)uX.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADLOT N10 DOL +15 433
#note DALTO(N).
>Noella_Ward: BELT 14B B. +16 270
>Matthew_Larocque: AT G1 AT. +13 446
#note (R)AT, kinda obvious! 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ELT) +6 452
#note I wasted too much time on my blank bingo rack so it cost me some timer points.
