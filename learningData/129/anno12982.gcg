>New_Player_1: AINOORT H6 ORATION +66 66
#note Good start, but don't be fooled. This match was ugly.
>New_Player_2: GOX G11 GOX +24 24
>New_Player_1: AEENTTY F10 YET +21 87
#note I didn't like the sound of ENTREATY at all.
>New_Player_2: IN 13E NI. +17 41
>New_Player_1: AAEEENT -AEE +0 87
#note ENATE is way better than exchanging.
>New_Player_2: DRW 6G W.RD +12 53
>New_Player_1: AEELNTU I4 LU.E +8 95
#note TONNEAU.
>New_Player_2: AZ G8 ZA +26 79
>New_Player_1: AENOQTT -QOT +0 95
#note I exchange too ofter. TONE was so much better.
>New_Player_2: EFIV H1 FIVE +36 115
>New_Player_1: AAENNTT 5D ANTA +13 108
#note And now that my Q is gone, I have no way of getting any points.
>New_Player_2: AI 4D AI +10 125
>New_Player_1: BEHNOTU F2 BUN. +15 123
#note Was too scared to play HUB, with both C's still out there. HUNT gave an S hook. BOUTON would've been nice.
>New_Player_2: ADO 1H .ADO +8 133
>New_Player_1: EHILOOT 2J OHO +18 141
>New_Player_2: ?IINSST K4 INSIsTS +71 204
#note Knew it was coming. Hoped it would open something else.
>New_Player_1: EEILRTU 10J U.E +5 146
#note I said to myself that it's too unlikely that she has another one. Though SUITE is still the play.
>New_Player_2: CEEHRST M4 RETCHES +70 274
#note -__-
>New_Player_1: EILMRTU 8M .UM +24 170
#note Ooh, MULTI(TON)[E].
>New_Player_2: CEIV 14B VICE +20 294
>New_Player_1: EEILRRT 15E TILER +18 188
#note Need to ensure at least two lanes are open. IZAR isn't the play IMO.
>New_Player_2: Q C13 Q. +22 316
>New_Player_1: EGKORRS C1 GROK +26 214
>New_Player_2: FMWY L10 .MF +16 332
>New_Player_2: FMWY --  -16 316
#note Here's my chance. I needed something like this to happen if I wanted to come back.
>New_Player_1: ADEELRS 14H DEALERS +75 289
>New_Player_2: FMWY L13 Y.W +13 329
#note WRETCHES was a bad miss...
>New_Player_1: ?ABEILO 1A BO. +18 307
#note Here is where I really didn't know what to do. I needed to open another lane and hope for two consonants, or try to score with bogie. I chose wrongly.
>New_Player_2: EF M12 FE. +22 351
#note Bad play, since that was her only vowel. 
>New_Player_1: ?AAEIJL O4 JAIL.AtE +74 381
>New_Player_1: ?AAEIJL --  -74 307
#note I was so happy about JAILMATE*, but I should've gone for points. I would have won. JAIL A6 wins, since she has no vowels, and if the J is blocked, I go with WAE/WRETCHES.
>New_Player_2: DGMNPP E3 M..D +11 362
>New_Player_1: ?AAEIJL O6 LA.A +6 313
#note I had no wins here, though I should've gone for points, and she might not have even challenged LALA*, and that would've won it for me.
>New_Player_2: GNPP L2 .P +4 366
>New_Player_1: ?EIJ 10B JIvE. +30 343
>New_Player_1:  (GNP) +12 355
#note Ugly loss. Terrible strategy on my part.
