>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEKTU 8H AUK +14 14
#note No bingos... need to get rid of the K and the U, so I set up an s-hook for my blank. I could also play DUKE, but I liked DET?
>Maureen_Morris: AFLTU 9E FAULT +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDEEPT 10D DEBT +30 44
#note BEDPl(A)TE - a frame support.
>Maureen_Morris: EX 10I EX +28 43

#note Well then.
>Maureen_Morris: ANR J5 RAN. +10 53
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABEIOW 4I OBIA +23 130
#note Either keep the W or keep a lot of vowels. Sim agrees here.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?GIOQRU 6H QU.I +13 191
#note This one had me baffled. I wanted to burn the Q and the blank for points but decided my chances to bingo were high enough to go fishing. I could have played QUI(T) for 23, but cmon, she's gonna have an E at the very least. The chances of me drawing a TWS Q play aren't nearly as likely.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGIOOR M8 GOOsIER +73 264
#note What a stupid word. Only bingo.
>Maureen_Morris: EU H5 E.U.. +14 150
>Matthew_Larocque: DHNOORV L10 N.H +24 288
#note Quackle is sending a message that the V is a bad letter. I suppose I could save this spot for next turn since she prolly won't play there anyways.
>Maureen_Morris: ACGHN 5C CHANG. +24 174
>Matthew_Larocque: CDMOORV N7 CORM +30 318
#note I played this pretty fast, but C(H)ORD is nice in that it takes out the easiest place to land a bingo. VROOM works too but 21 points seems like I'm cutting a lot of scoring.
>Maureen_Morris: EO O8 OE +21 195
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIOTV C3 VI.ED +26 344
#note I'm pretty sure I've missed this bingo before. Have to work on those words ending in -OR. I'm not entirely sure why I didn't play VOI(C)ED instead. Played too fast, that's all. I didn't know AVOCET.
>Maureen_Morris: EILW B6 WILE +31 226
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAOOST 4C .OTA +22 366
#note This was a useful find.
>Maureen_Morris: DOT A5 TOD +15 241
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADIOS 3B A.O +12 378
#note Apparently it has nothing to do with DIASPORE. Playing off one vowel is probably better because of how few are left.
>Maureen_Morris: LL L4 .LL +17 258
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADINS 15A .ADIANtS +77 455
#note There's one other bingo through the R.
>Maureen_Morris: J 8G J... +25 283
>Matthew_Larocque: GINPR 3L PING +20 475
#note PRIG instead because the N scores 8.
>Maureen_Morris: ENSSTY 3F TYES +18 301
>Matthew_Larocque: R 9B .R +3 478
>Matthew_Larocque:  (NS) +4 482
#note I did go overtime mostly because of the QU(A)I play. Although I did well this tournament I had very few blowouts (this is more of a semi-blowout, even) mostly because I let way too many phony plays stay on the board.
