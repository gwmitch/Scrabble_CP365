#note I was really close to playing GOOSED. The board is pretty ugly after ROUGE, though. ROUGE is winning the sim, but I could go either way.

>Will: IIJLORW K5 JOW +31 248
#note Thought about JOWL and JIAO too. JOWL cuts down on a lot of the hooks down column M, most notably the S.
>Jan: DEIK M5 DIKE +33 208
#note And the K too.
>Will: HIILRTU 8L ..TH +27 275
#note Haha, I saw TRILITH...feels like you'd have to be insane to try that.
>Jan: ACER N10 CAR.E +26 234
>Will: IILMRUU 3I .LIUM +14 289
#note I saw ULU, but preferred to keep a U and block lanes - maybe all I really need is an I as a Q hedge here for now, though.
>Jan: LV L2 L.V +12 246
>Will: AEIIRUY J2 A.E +22 311
#note Bad. I totally missed 9J ARTY, which keeps IU for QUIZ if I draw the Q. 
>Jan: IX O14 XI +36 282
>Will: IIORUVY 13C VO. +15 326
#note Getting increasingly confused here. Not sure I can justify this play other than that I didn't like K10 YO because as the player with the lead I just need to avoid being Q stuck, and closing Q spots was not the way to accomplish that goal.
>Jan: STU K9 UTS +14 296
>Will: GIIMRUY 4G GI.. +8 334
#note Holding on to the letters for MIRZA, which sets up Q spots (although they can be blocked easily enough).
>Jan: CO 7C CO... +20 316
>Will: AIMPRUY C3 PYRI. +24 358
#note Very low on time here - I decide to let Jan have an easy Q play and just go out.
