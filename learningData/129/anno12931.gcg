#note Ugh. It's getting ugly fast and I get desperate, so I make up a random word. I had never played Anita before so I didn't know what kind of crap I could get away with. Not this kind, that's for sure. PERSON isn't even a verb.

#note I was scored at 305 not 307. So in round one I made a comeback after being down by 170, then I go on to actually lose by 170. Obviously lightning did not strike twice.
