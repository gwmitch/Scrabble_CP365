#note I really liked how this play sets me up for a big score next turn. With only one A and one O unseen bruce will have a hard time playing here. Every so often he'll wipe me out with AZIDO/AZIDE, but it seemed to reduce variance considerably. my alternative is MILADY at 7H which I actually didn't know.
