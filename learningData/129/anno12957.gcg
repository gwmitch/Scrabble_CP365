#note Thought for a while about this move. Happy to see COMB sims best by a good margin. A sim knows better than I do just how frequently I will get LEZ/FEZ/ZED or something crazier. COOMB risks the setup being blocked and needlessly opens a triple.

>Will: EENORSZ H10 ....ER +30 328
#note This time, I didn't think hard enough about 6J Z plays. H7 S(U)N(DOWN)ER is insane. This isn't too bad, but taking 45 right now would've been better.

>Will: ENNORSZ 11G N.NZERO +34 362
#note Now I see and consider ZONES but I went for this instead...maybe I should play NONZEROS*?
>Andrew: FKLU K7 FLUK. +12 409
>Will: AEIIRRS 15J AIRIER +26 388
#note Darn, I thought about AIRERS to keep the vowel and slot the S.  I did not consider 13J AIRER at all, opening a lane for my S. 33+ percent win seems absurdly optimistic, though. Andrew is not going to let me play there if he can help it at all. I suppose he could be overloaded with consonants, which would make it tougher for him to block and might also let me win some endgames.
