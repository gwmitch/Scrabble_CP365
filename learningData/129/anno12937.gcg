#note not a great decision because it gives up so many points...quackle prefers something like DAY trying to draw a big X play at H1.

#note I thought I had to create a new lane since mark can block from here by playing just about anything at 10E. Ideally I would dumb the U, but I can't figure out how to do that.

#note this is the kind of position where quackle is no longer so useful. the pool is extremely good - he's quite likely to have a bingo of his own. but by creating a new high-scoring lane I think I give myself the best chance of stealing this game...quackle suggests OORALI at 6B, which increases my chances of picking up the blank, but then if mark plays at 10C I don't see how I can bingo.
>Mark_Milan: ?DINOST 6A INT.aDOS +64 408
#note as mark realized after the game, all he really has to do is NOT bingo! DOW/DUH just about guarantees a win.
>JD: AEILPST 10A APLITES +75 405
#note I passed up PALIEST just to be 100% sure I had the win. what a lucky draw!
