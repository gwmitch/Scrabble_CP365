#note AARGH sims quite poorly, I think because the pool is very vowel-heavy, and there's a high risk of duplicating the Os. My average score per turn is ~32 as opposed to 43 for GHERAO.

#note dumping the Q and blocking a bunch of lanes seemed like the best idea. I have YEW next turn if necessary. that said quackle likes other options as well like WOE at C11 or exchanging.

>JD: EEIOTWY 15H .OE +6 373
#note it's definitely not a standard play but I was worried about bingoes through the H (which he will have a decent amount of time...PARFLESH jumped out in particular) and I saw that this way I would keep WITTY for 37 at the very least. that said I missed the lane at O9 which definitely would've complicated my analysis!! I can take a shot this turn and play WEEST for 32 but then I lose to bingoes through the O or the H. I think a play like WYE at 10M might be a solid choice, since it messes with column O and gives me a great chance at a nice big play at 14J that can outrun if necessary - I probably fixated on WITTY too much. but I still think it was a decent idea.

#note when I realized that he had FLASHER at O9 I knew I might be in big trouble! but my play last turn set this up for enough points to survive. in fact, given his sequence of plays I almost think this may be my only two-turn sequence that doesn't lose.
>Ron_Gideons: ?AEFLRS A4 REFL.AtS +61 406
#note I believe Ron said he knew PARFLESH, so I would've had to block both row 15 and column O in two turns while scoring 51 points. After WYE I'm not sure I can score enough to outrun REFLOATS/SAFROLES.
