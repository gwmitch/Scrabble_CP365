#note AERV > ER apparently.  By .4.  I don't know.

>Ryan_Fischer: EELLOPR 7H POLL +17 17
#note OLE for 16 or POLE for 17?  This doesn't rank.
>Martin_Weisskopf: DINORSU L1 DIURONS +77 105
#note Held and released.  Forgot for a sec if there was a 3rd.  He had DINOSAUR, too.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEORT 1J RE.ATE +21 38
#note I don't know how successful fishing to AEERT would be.  OE 9G 11
>Martin_Weisskopf: ETVX 9C VEXT +33 138
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEIOOP 4H PECO.InO +65 103
#note Didn't like playing this, but it's the only thing I could find... and the only thing there.
>Martin_Weisskopf: MY 3K Y.M +29 167
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFHIIN E4 HAND.. +34 137
#note Both top plays keep two Is.  If that's the case, I'd rather take more points, too.  *shrug*  I guess Q likes DIIN better than FII 'cause of bingo prospects?  (FA(IT)H is the other play).
>Martin_Weisskopf: INSZ D1 ZINS +56 223
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: CFIIIMQ C2 QI +37 174
>Martin_Weisskopf: EINS 1D .INES +42 265
#note OW!
>Ryan_Fischer: CFIIMRR O3 F.RMIC +39 213
#note At least I saw this.
>Martin_Weisskopf: IIOOUUU -UUUIIOO +0 265
#note It's rare when x7 is right.  Makes me feel like I can breathe a bit easier.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILNRU E4 ......ING +42 255
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILNRU --  -42 213
#note Okay, I had HANDAXE on my rack back in Durham to a D and knew then it was no good, so I don't know why I could get away with it here.  Q says fish off the U.  But where do I bingo?
>Martin_Weisskopf: EF 2F EF +16 281
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILNRU D8 ..GUN +16 229
#note Was thinking BEGUILE or VIRGULE but those give away too many good letters when he's been fishing.  Then after so much time spent I stumbled into BEGUN and was sort of okay with it.  U(M) is probably still best, though.  He might make a mistake.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EGOORT 11C O.TfORGE +66 347
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EGOORT --  -66 281
#note I insta-challenged it.  He swore it sounded plausible to him.  Hehe.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIILRS N1 .I +4 233
#note So he's got no bingos, and with inference I can take the A hook on FORMIC and do something, leaving myself a decent leave and him nothing.  I think.  But I decide to fish instead.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EGOORT 6B GOO. +9 290
#note Pretty good fish by him, too.  3G TOO 19 is best, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEILRS 6N A. +6 239
#note I can dump the A making FORMICA but this just gives him an easy lane.  Of course, it will allow me to bingo back, but I can't have that being down so much right now.  I have to get down a bingo while preventing him from doing so with the blank.  Tricky business, but doable.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?AEHJRT E11 HAJ +38 328
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILRRS 14C RAILERS +73 312
#note Well, mission accomplished, I'm back in it.  For now.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EGRT 15B GET +10 338
#note Not TEG or GET/TRAILERS?  :o
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDKNUV H12 KA.N +39 351
#note Okay, so thought process is, it's really hard to bingo from an L.  Don't worry about it.  But you gotta score and not give him another lane to work with.  So, it's DARK or KARN.  Though the DD leave this late might be trouble, I'd rather try to see him bingo from a K.
>Martin_Weisskopf: B 13G B. +14 352
#note Interesting.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDTUVW 5A VAW +17 368
#note And the winning plays are sitting right in front of me, but because I was low on time, I didn't think to block.  Who would think to block that K lane anyway?  The L is still more of a threat.  I11 WAD(S) 24 is 67.88% to win.  Anything there does pretty well.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?EOORTW 12H .OWTOwER +80 432
#note Or KOTOWERs.  I challenged 'cause the game is lost otherwise.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDETTU -  +0 368
>Martin_Weisskopf: EU K11 U.E +6 438
#note Tough way to lose, but in hindsight, I did everything right but that last thing.
>Martin_Weisskopf:  (ADDETTU) +18 456
