>Lisa_Slankard: ?AABIOR 8F AeROBIA +68 68
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEFLTZ L8 .ZALEA +30 30
#note 7G FATAL 32?  AZALEA doesn't even rank.  Odd.
>Lisa_Slankard: EIINP 11J PI.I +12 80
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGIOOT 7C GOOF +15 45
#note Missed FOG for 28 or FOOTAGE for 24.  Off to a really slow start.
>Lisa_Slankard: EKN D4 KEN. +16 96
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIINRT 12D NITRIDE +72 117
#note At least I fell into this.
>Lisa_Slankard: DENORSU 9C SOUNDER +77 173
#note Aw.  (UNDOERS and ENDUROS are 78.)  One forgets just how many words are in that rack!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BGINTX 11E XI +38 155
#note NIX for 44?  I guess I figured the N would go together better with what was there.
>Lisa_Slankard: HTWY H11 W.THY +42 215
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABEGNT 5A ABN.GaTE +70 225
#note This and ABNEGAT(OR) are the only bingos.  Big, stupid mistake here not putting the blank in the 3x3 lane.  I don't know how I missed that.  Guess I wasn't quite awake yet, having only had a couple hours of sleep.
>Lisa_Slankard: ELUV A4 V.LUE +36 251
>Ryan_Fischer: ADHMNOS H1 MOSH.D +48 273
#note HANDSOME, no go.  Also ADMONISH which I didn't see, MANHOODS which I did.
>Lisa_Slankard: AO 4C O.A +12 263
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIMNV C3 M.. +10 283
#note She's fishing.  Should I?  I saw if I could dump the M I'd draw VESICANT with a T, VICENARY with an R, INVOCATE/CONATIVE with a T as well.  Also VOIDANCE with a D, VERONICA with an R.  It was too much to resist.  So if course I'd miss.  AM(I)NIC alongside the Z is the star play.
>Lisa_Slankard: AEEINRT 6H .ETAINER +63 326
#note And she got it with two tiles.  Bleh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFINV O4 FA.CI +42 325
>Lisa_Slankard: COT 13J CO.T +19 345
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGLNUV 3E GUV. +17 342
#note Champ says ENGULF or UNGLOVE.  I'm pretty in trouble here, I think, though the score seems to say otherwise.  Too tight, not many scoring or bingoing options.  Maybe I should've left the O alone more.
>Lisa_Slankard: DOWY M3 DOW.Y +32 377
#note Ow.
