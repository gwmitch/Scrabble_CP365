#note Dammit, I chickened out on ARMY/RIMY/MIRY/AIRY for massive points.  Figured that's something he'd have to challenge, and I just didn't have word knowledge deep enough to be sure.

#note Again, plays off GRUFF(Y).  TYKE, TYPO, or TYPE.  Still, those offer bingo lanes I don't want to give.  Same problem with KEEP or KEMP M6.

#note This play is just biding my time.  I can hit the M column hard soon enough.  Seeing if he makes a mistake.

>Ryan_Fischer: AELNORS 12D LENS +14 390
#note Now here's a case where I *think* the math dictates passing up the bingo.  I'm not experienced enough to know for sure.  Champ says N10 LOSER 35, then LOANERS, then N7 ANOLES 34.  I think it's all too likely he can hit SNIB for a bingo or bingo back, so going with my gut and blocking to save spread does it for me.  1000 spins 2-ply, LENS barely rates, with 5-tile plays outranking the bingos.  I wish I would've remembered to ask what his rack was here, though that's hardly an indication what the right play is.
