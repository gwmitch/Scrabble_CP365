#note too open. DIP or DIPT or noahji likes exchanging. (-6) actually this is bad because i keep making plays like this against whitley despite telling myself before the game to not do that. does QI necessarily imply anything?

#note he challenged! this was funny because i know david knows a lot of words and challenged pretty quickly, so i was pretty sure i had screwed up again and muttered something like "do you know all the words.. that word looks ok to me" (expecting it to come back bad but trying to save a little face.. lol)

#note i lost "33 points of equity" that game. sure felt like a lot more; sometimes i'd rather just miss a bingo and play the rest ok, but i'm not sure why i wasn't finding wrung/gauze/etc. i was trying to play fairly fast and on autopilot, but i also got pretty lucky at the end.
