>JD: AAEFHQT N1 QAT +26 94
#note quackle prefers FEH holding the Q. this gives up a lot of easy points.

#note fairish is a couple of extra points
>Noah: AEEIJNT M12 AJEE +27 204
>JD: ACGLUXY 14J GLU.Y +26 243
#note totally missed culex which wins the sim by a whole bunch.
>Noah: AIMNOOT 12B AMOTION. +70 274
>JD: ACOPSTX 15L P.AT +39 282
#note I figured I could cash in the X anytime if I drew an I. 
>Noah: AEEIMPV 13A VEEP +32 306
>JD: CKNOSTX H12 .OCK +35 317
#note again, I figured the X was going to be available to cash in anytime and the rest of the leave is inflexible. but the points are tempting.
>Noah: ABEEIMU 11C EMU +26 332
>JD: INRSSTX 14D SIX +34 351
#note I thought the S wouldn't be that valuable. I need a vowel. this also takes out more scoring spots.
>Noah: ABEEIIS A13 .IE +18 350
>JD: DIINRST 15E DIN. +21 372
#note needed to dump the N for fear of duplication
>Noah: ABEGIRS N10 BIG +19 369
#note Tough play. Quackle comes up with AG(E) L2, which might be a good play here. Jesse's often going to have a tough time doing much about the setup, and sometimes he's just going to deal with it and easily win. Looks like a good shot, certainly better than anything I came up with.
>JD: INNORST O10 INS +19 391
#note the O is now the most important tile thanks to ODOR. with that in mind I figured I would take as many points as I could now and try to draw an out/a  big play. there's not much noah can do after this. a quick look at all the endgames reveals that this does seal the deal.
>Noah: ADELNRS 13G N.. +10 379
#note Missed O(DOR), which made me think this was a good play. Quackle approves of D(AG)/D(EDUCT) to lose by 17.
>JD: NORTW F6 WOT +23 414
#note didn't have a ton of time so I was happy to take WOT and the certain win even after the out...quackle says the best is TURBO setting up OWNER out and WO as a backup.
>Noah: ADELRS 10A RED +13 392
#note Missed S(WOT) and ERN, costing me quite a few points.
>JD: NR 15A .RN +3 417
