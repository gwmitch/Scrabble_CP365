#note Thought about VIPER instead to leave the F for FOY, but I figured the 2 extra points and keeping the P over the F was slightly better.

#note Didn't think of UNGIRD for 34. Is FOUR really as terrible as Quackle suggests? I figured that GROUND was pretty good, but it leaves just an I and I could have a poor next rack. I think I overestimated the bingo/scoring potential of DING, and the damage that can be done by a play like AZINE or AQUAS. Quackle even likes DOING better than FOUR. Definitely a mistake.

#note Trickiest decision of the game. It's obvious that Jesse has a strong rack, but should I risk a terrible leave to block? He really needs 2 bingoes to catch up here. I debated between SHE, HE, and QIS. Another good option is CHIRK, setting up QIS if I draw an I but I didn't consider it for long. The reason I decided not to block was that if he has a bingo, his rack is probably strong enough to bingo regardless of where I block, and I didn't want to be stuck scoring poorly next turn to dump my Q or blocking the board while retaining the Q. I figured the most likely scenario was a bingo to the triple, after which I can kill lanes with the 38 point CHEEK or something better, which might even be enough to outrun a second bingo if something crazy happens. Worst case scenario is that Jesse double-doubles, and I have 2 lanes to deal with on the right. Many-ply hates QIS, championship player rates it very close.

#note Setting up the last S, and threatening JOSH, JUS, or something ending in -SH if I draw decently. The double-double lane isn't much of a threat because the pool is vowel heavy.
