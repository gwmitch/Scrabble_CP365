>Tony_Rankin: AADEINR 8F ARANEID +70 70
>Chris_Canik: ADIKNTY L4 KATY.ID +32 32
#note Love this word. Also happens to be the best sim.
>Tony_Rankin: AHOOW M3 WAHOO +43 113
>Chris_Canik: ?CEIINU 11I CUIsINE +82 114
#note As hesitant as I am to leave that Triple there, none of the other bingos score enough to warrant not playing this.
>Tony_Rankin: DEFNR O7 FERN.D +36 149
>Chris_Canik: EEGMOTT 9F GEMOT +25 139
#note I didn't even consider that FERNED* was phoney, because he has FENDER in the same place. Honest mistake on both of our parts. GEMOT is the play.
>Tony_Rankin: EMN 7F MEN +21 170
>Chris_Canik: ABEILRT 5J AB.. +18 157
#note I totally know my 4's... thankfully neither does he. And no, there are no bingos. AB(AH) doesn't sim the best, if you ignore that it's phoney... Q likes BIT N2 for some reason. B(AH) is third, and AB(AH) is nearby.
>Tony_Rankin: AERR 10C RARE +15 185
>Chris_Canik: EFIILRT 4D FIRELIT +74 231
#note I don't like FLIRTIER in either placement because it allows for an easy comeback for him on the Triple, and also because I feel like he was just dumping R's, and not setting up U(RARE). 
>Tony_Rankin: LLZ E3 Z.LL +26 211
>Chris_Canik: EGIPTWY 3C WI. +35 266
>Tony_Rankin: PU 6I UP +21 232
>Chris_Canik: ?EEGPTY D8 PE.TY +26 292
#note Q likes PE(A)TY less than YEP 3G... I think I agree with Q. Then again, Q also likes GEY N2 about as much as PE(A)TY, which I really don't like, especially with five O's left for (G)O and (KAY)O after GEY is played for an easy Triple.
>Tony_Rankin: NOU N8 NOU. +14 246
>Chris_Canik: ?EGHJOU H1 JOU.E +36 328
#note So close to JUGHEaD at B9. JOU(L)E is best.
>Tony_Rankin: AESX N1 AXES +34 280
>Chris_Canik: ?BGGHOT 1M B.G +18 346
#note I probably should've taken the points for GH(A)T, but I get coerced by the U(RARE) possibilities of keeping GHOT? for easy -OUGHT or OUT- bingoes. 
>Tony_Rankin: LOSSTVV -III +0 280
>Chris_Canik: ?AGHOTT 8A ATO. +18 364
#note I get complacent and don't realize that he can't hit the U(RARE) spot and I can... so I block it for no reason with ATO(P). This actually bites me in the ass.
>Tony_Rankin: EILNRSS A7 R.INLESS +59 339
>Chris_Canik: ?ACGHTV 2G G.TCHA +18 382
#note (S)CHAV is cool, but I don't know it. G(O)TCHA is almost as cool. Either way, it's an easy endgame, because 7/8 times, he has the Q and it's game over.
>Tony_Rankin: DIIOQSV -  +0 339
>Chris_Canik: ?SV B6 Ve.S +17 399
#note Interestingly, this bag seemed to have been missing an I... that or I missed a tile in the bag. In any case, my rack at this point is SV?, the bag is empty, and he has only 7 tiles. He challenged G(O)TCHA because it was his only hope - he didn't actually pass. 
>Tony_Rankin: DIIOOQV -  +0 339
>Chris_Canik: E C2 E. +5 404
#note I'm just putting this here to end the game so I can post it. Refer to last play's comment. Final score as counted by us: 439-339. 
>Chris_Canik:  (DIIOOQV) +40 444
