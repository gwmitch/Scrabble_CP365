>Jim_Burlant: ABCDENT 10G BED +28 54
#note BEND scores 4 more, but it breaks up the rack that much more and it also gives an S hook back down the 2x2 line, which is why I opted for this.  Q agrees - this is best.

>Jim_Burlant: ACILNTU 8A TUNIC +32 86
#note The previous two days, the no-gos had been killing me.  Literally, every fourth bingo rack I could manufacture this tournament didn't play, and I only drew a total of one bingo out of the bag in 20 games - that's abysmally low.  Anyway, when I saw this rack and realized it wouldn't play, my first reaction was, "Here we go again."   As to this position, either this or AULIC 8A is best.  
>Ken_Kasney: AEIMOTV A2 MOTIVA.E +64 113
>Jim_Burlant: AALNRRU D10 .URAL +10 96
#note So rattled by the sequence of yet another no-go, followed by Ken's bingo, followed by this cruddy draw that I missed the best plays.  AURAL or RURAL at J4 are the plays.  This is awful.
>Ken_Kasney: EKZ C13 ZEK +56 169
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: AENNPRS J2 PANNERS +81 177
#note Either slot the 3x3 for 76 or risk the row 1 S hook for 81.  I opted to risk the S hook and Q confirms this was the right call.  44% to win.
>Ken_Kasney: DOUX K3 DOUX +42 211
>Jim_Burlant: ILOQSSY 1H QIS +46 223
#note Good play, but not best in Quackle's eyes.  There is something to be said for leaving row 1 open with me sitting on 2 of the 3 unplayed S's.  Having said that, with S?? unseen and Murphy's Law having been the rule for most of the tournament, I felt this was enough to justify taking out row 1.  Q likes 3I QADIS (which scores 50 to this play's 46) best; this is runner up.  QADIS wins 54%; this wins 50.
>Ken_Kasney: AORT B1 TORA +20 231
>Jim_Burlant: ELOSTVY 15A YO. +30 253
#note Tons of good options, and once again I've made a good play but I haven't looked hard enough to find the best play.  C2 LEVY scores 37 and is best.  But this may have worked out better for me.
>Ken_Kasney: AINO C2 NAOI +22 253
>Jim_Burlant: DEHLSTV 14B H..VED +40 293
#note Best, nothing else remotely worth consideration.  68% to win.
>Ken_Kasney: ?EGIILP -?EGII +0 253
>Jim_Burlant: EEHILST 11I SHELTIE +78 371
#note Nervous about slotting the 3x3 with ?? unseen and Ken having just exchanged 5 with S?? unseen, but this is the only place the bingo plays.  91% to win.
>Ken_Kasney: ALLM 13F MALL +16 269
>Jim_Burlant: BCEGGOW 15F WOG +33 404
#note Obviously, defending the O column is my first priority, and one problem with this position is that the only viable equity plays (WEBLOG and BOWLEG L8) don't defend anything.   Quackle confirms I don't have a play down the O column. I gave serious consideration to BO 10N before rejecting it.  I felt that if he came back for 80 on row 15 (for that matter, ESTATED could score 90) I wouldn't have any sort of meaningful comeback with my remaining CEGGW and he could catch up to me that way. I didn't like leaving the O column open with this choice but I figured that this pushed the lead to 135, and he had this turn and only this turn to find a 3x3 off his 4-tile draw.  As for the sim:  though BO doesn't show on the kibbitzer's list of initial choices, it wins 97%.  None of Quackle's other choices win above 90.  This wins 89, which is more than any of the other choices that actually defends anything.   In retrospect,  I should have played BO.
>Ken_Kasney: ?ADERTT O5 REsTAT.D +80 349
#note Missing THREATED and ATTENDER for 131 and 122 respectively.
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEFGI N4 CAFE +33 437
#note I was so giddy that he'd missed ATTENDER and so happy that I'd finally had a game where I could actually do more than sit and watch my opponents play while I ground through racks that didn't balance, that I fell asleep at the switch.  I saw 33 for CAFE and put it down on auto-pilot.  After replenishing tiles, when I saw 6 tiles in my rack, I realized, "Oh shit, I've emptied the bag!"  I checked the tracking, and right as I realized what was in his rack and thought for sure I had thrown the win away, he put this down:
>Ken_Kasney: ?EEINPS L7 SEPa.INE +70 419
#note What's even more amazing is that Ken had seen PLENTIES and wasn't sure enought to try it, even though it was the only way he saw to win, especially since he scored this as 66 and I was the one who brought it to his attention that this scored 70 and tied.
