>Christian_O.B: ?AEOUXY 8E EAUX +22 22
#note Tricky best play... since I can play EUTAXY for 46 but burn the blanks. Quackle like EAUX more than EUTAXY
>Albert_Martono: IMNORST 7G MO +23 23
#note It's shame even with tile like that and E A U possible bingo floater, there were no bingo available... Albert play was best, retained INRST
>Christian_O.B: ?AEEOSY 6E OYE +19 41
#note No bingo for me too... Prefer OYES 6E since it likely forced Albert to open triple word for nine-timer possiblility if he bingo
>Albert_Martono: EIINRST 7G ..I +6 29
#note Actually I don't know exactly what Albert have here. This is my pure guessing, since he very confortably dump only I. He must retain very deadly stem here (INSERT, the most likely) that he can make sure that he will able to bingo after this. If he hold it, he missed ERITINES E8.
>Christian_O.B: ?AEIORS 9F ISObARE +76 117
#note Quackle like ISOBARE too. I spot many many bingo here... ISOBARE is the highest one, and set my-self for big score (since Albert chasing bingo, he was most likely not have a right tile to use that exposed E
>Albert_Martono: EILNRST L8 R.ENLIST +70 99
#note The reason Albert play REENLIST, he was not sure about ISOBARE can be pluralize, since there are so many ISO- which only adjective. His best play, LINTERS/ISObARES for 76 points
>Christian_O.B: DEHLMOW 15G HOWLE. +36 153
#note WHOM 5C and WHELM 5B quackle like more.
>Albert_Martono: AQT 14F QAT +39 138
>Christian_O.B: AADMNP 5C DAMN +27 180
#note Without know 1 unknown tile (forget about it) quackle like PADMA 5B for 33 most. Don't know that words. Should study 5-letters more often
>Albert_Martono: LV J8 L.V +14 152
#note I clearly have no idea, was that a balancer move or preparing move to bingo, since it open save bingo line, and hitting double word square. AND BLOCK MY CAPPING!
>Christian_O.B: ACGIPP 4B PIP +25 205
>Albert_Martono: GJ 13K J.G +22 174
#note Albert LAV maybe a balancer move, palying JIG was a clear sign that he had bunch of consonant
>Christian_O.B: AAACDEG 10B CAAED +26 231
#note My move here was quackle like most. However I just don't understand... 11E CADAGA score 27 and block save bingo line for Albert, was valuated 2-3 points lower than my play CAAED for 26. With 30 points lead again strong player, it may be wise to keep the board hard to bingo
>Albert_Martono: DHIN 11B HIND +33 207
>Christian_O.B: ABDGU 3A BUG +26 257
#note Reason I play BUG instead GUB... I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT GUB... LOL
>Albert_Martono: BENT 12A BENT +35 242
#note Albert continued his super-parallel move
>Christian_O.B: AAIRSTW N10 WAIST +44 301
#note 9B AW for 29 valuated 4-5 points higher than WAIST for 44. The 5 letters STAIR leave was too good to be sacrifice for 15 extra points. I didn't see that I can dump AW for over 20 points at that time...
>Albert_Martono: ?DEOTUY A12 .UOY +27 269
#note Albert missed TUTOYED 05 for 88, and it was because my WAIST play, otherwise he can only (if he spot TUTOYED) play TUTOYED in 6I for low-scoring bingo 66 and open me nine-timer possiblities
>Christian_O.B: AEIIORR O6 OARIER +25 326
#note K6 ROARIE score 25 and leave IR. Clearly better move than risky play OARIER in 6O, because Z and K still unseen. If Albert had Z, and can make 5-letters ended with Z, that will, drop my winning chance close to 0%. I don't sure about ROARIE (only ROARY that I'm sure is a good word) However, with Albert hold DET?, this OARIER will probably block his bingo...
>Albert_Martono: ?DEKRT N3 TREK +34 303
#note Fotrunately Albert only has K, not Z. DREK for 35 in same position was better than TREK. (without know what Albert 1 unkown tile)
>Christian_O.B: EFIINTZ 7C FIZ +34 360
#note Another errorneous move for me this turn. Best play according quackle was NIEF for only 25 points, leave ZIT, since it likely block the bingo line for Albert to catch up. It gave me 76,5% chance to win this game, compared to FIZ scored 34 points gave me chance of winning only 70%. FIZ leave TINE, seems to be best, but at this stage, IT'S MUCH MUCH better to burn all bingo line, than chasing bingo. Because the probability of Albert throwing a bingo to turn the game was really high now
>Albert_Martono: ?DEGORU 4G GROUnDE. +70 373
#note Quackle notice something here. Something that even scrabble pro player will likely cannot see it. The remained tile, was balanced enough, but it contain poisonous combination C,V and F. Getting a bingo will raise the probability to getting that 3 poisonous combnation in a rack much higher. Moreover, my bingo chance was small enough, because I don't have blank. So quackle generate Albert best move, was NOT A BINGO, but CHEGOE B10 for 36, gave him approximately 55% chance to win this game, rather than GROUNDER that approximately gave him chance of winning just 40%. Quackle hope that keeping the blank, and play less tile, will make C,V and F to be picked by me, and Albert can catch me in very very last move, because he has blank to increase the flexibility in last move.
>Christian_O.B: AEINNOT K7 NO.IA +23 383
#note If Albert followed Quackle advice, he will get punished immediately by my INTONATE H3 for 68 points. Did quackle strategy wrong? I don't think so. I just get right tile, and right floater (T) to form a bingo. Quackle suggest me: Play NET first, than NORIA, because Quackle know the best Albert can do, was to play EFS/ECHE/FAIN/SANT there for 34 points, while my AION leave will be UNSTOPPABLE with 7K NORIA (my move now for 23) and ANION 6A for 15 points
>Albert_Martono: CEFLSV B14 FE +25 398
#note Now that the reason why Quackle think the best move Albert could do in last move, is not to bingo, but to score high enough using minimal tile. Because the combination of tile that Albert will get after his bingo, will be killing him softly. Albert last move was only 9th best. His best EFS 9B for 34 points, however he still lost by 8 points
>Christian_O.B: ENT 9A TEN +18 401
#note Best move, no doubt, there are no move higher than this to finish the game
>Christian_O.B:  (CLSV) +18 419
