#note WTF??? AARRGHH!! I should have been 100% on a word like this, but every once in a while some doofus plays one that slipped past my studies, and I end up losing the game. But I just CAN'T LET THIS GO!!!

>Jason_Keller: EORV 14G ROVE +14 365
>Winter: ?AAEEGO H1 GA.E +18 392
#note And this was my other big mistake--if I had ditched the O, I might have drawn into a bingo depending on what was in the bag (I, S, or N). But in actuality, only the S yields a bingo, which I wouldn't have found. Still, the extra three points would have provided a cushion, and also left Jason with just two tiles for his out play, and thus a lower score. REVIEW THOSE FIVES!!!
