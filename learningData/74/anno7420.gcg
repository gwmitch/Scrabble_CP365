#note WCSC early bird 1 - round 3.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGITU J3 AUGITE +22 22
>Wendy_MgGrath: AQ 7H QA. +29 53
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIMPSU K8 SIMP +30 52
#note Well, lots of other (better?) options here - I just didn't know the words. Most of them contain a U. SPUE, SUPE,  SPUME, GUIMPE. I asked Championship Player, and SIMP was actually ranked 4th, behind JUPE, Exch. IU, and GUIMPE.
>Wendy_MgGrath: EHRS 12I RESH +23 76
#note Saving an F? I didn't want to find out the hard way!
>Matthew_Larocque: BEILLOU G8 .UBILE +17 69
>Wendy_MgGrath: ACILNS 5E LACIN.S +40 116
>Matthew_Larocque: ALLOOUY 6B ALLOY +33 102
>Wendy_MgGrath: ADEINZ 3G ZEN.IDA +56 172
#note I haven't studied longer words containing JQXZ, but my gut told me that few people would try to phony with those types of words.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEOORTU 14A OUTRODE +90 192
#note Lucky break with these somewhat clunky racks I've been picking up.
>Wendy_MgGrath: EN 15E NE +7 179
#note Understandably nervous about that area, especially after I have drawn 7 new tiles.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAADGGN A12 AG.G +21 213
#note Wow, a 6 letter word with three As and two Gs.
>Wendy_MgGrath: IKO B10 KOI +19 198
>Matthew_Larocque: AADNPRW C9 WAND +24 237
#note Well, I didn't even see PAWN in the same spot....
>Wendy_MgGrath: FI H1 FI. +18 216
>Matthew_Larocque: AEOPRRV 1H .AVOR +12 249
#note I really just forgot about hooking onto KA here, focused on getting rid of that opening.
>Wendy_MgGrath: EET D10 TEE +26 242
>Matthew_Larocque: EEOOPRR 7D OPE +18 267
#note Didn't know PROLE. OPERA probably wouldn't hurt me, but unlikely events that could hurt me tend to happen anyways!
>Wendy_MgGrath: EX 4L EX +33 275
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMORRW 2L OW +23 290
#note My mistake here was forgetting that INS/ENS/ONS/UNS would all fit and would all destroy me. I was originally going to play OMER, but I thought that was too dangerous.
>Wendy_MgGrath: NSU N1 UNS +36 311
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMNRR F9 NAME +22 312
#note REALM/MOPE is the best scoring, and has a good leave. I didn't notice it. Championship player recommends HM/MAR, making a blatant hook opportunity to the TWS. Do I need to make a move that desperate here?
>Wendy_MgGrath: CDO 4C DOC +20 331
>Matthew_Larocque: EHRRTTV 3B VET +20 332
#note Ok, in hindsight, not saving an E kind of gave me an unplayable rack.
>Wendy_MgGrath: ??FIRTY 15E ..sT +25 356
#note Double blanked, but not in the usual fashion here....
>Matthew_Larocque: HRRT 10J H. +15 347
#note Missed a chance to play off 3 tiles....
>Wendy_MgGrath: ?FIRY I11 F.Y +13 369
>Matthew_Larocque: RRT 1N .T +6 353
>Wendy_MgGrath: ?IR A8 ReI +14 383
>Wendy_MgGrath:  (RR) +4 387
#note Bad planning on my part - suffocated myself with no vowels.
