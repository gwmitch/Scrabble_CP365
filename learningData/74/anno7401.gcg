>Zev: DEMOSST 8D MODEST +24 24
#note I infer his remaining tile is an S or this play doesn't make sense.

#note 50.1 I challenge the play, perhaps wrongly with a potential bingo at G2 that plays.  I just didn't recognize that word.  It is a word I should be very familiar with after life drawing courses in college.  Google define::croquis --> "Croquis drawing is quick and sketchy drawing of a live model..."

#note Thank goodness my spot wasn't blocked.

#note Edges out D(U)MPER and (U)MPED in the same spot.
>Zev: ADS K5 SAD +16 152
#note I infer he is keeping an S and a tidy leave.

>Jeremy: ?AEGRTV 8L .AV +6 189
#note 16.4 ERGATiV(E).  Completely missed that.  I thought this play was pretty clever given all the other S's and blanks were out.  This is pretty hard to block.  Zev says, "uh oh".
>Zev: CINO N6 CO.IN +18 238
>Jeremy: ?EGRTTW 13J GR.W +16 205
#note 1.6 13H (P)EWT(E)R.  It's 8 more points.  I started putting down PEWTER, but switched to this at the last second.  -TTE(D) endings outranked keeping a G in my head.  It's pretty close.
>Zev: HI G14 HI +13 251
>Jeremy: ?EEKRTT O8 sTEEK +61 266
#note 26.6 2G (PA)RKETTEs.  This is why I'm a STEE.  I miss it and play sTEEK instead.
>Zev: ADIIO D1 OIDIA +17 268
>Jeremy: ABEERRT C2 BEAR +28 294
#note 49.8 1H (V)ERTEBRA.  Tough!
>Zev: JO B1 JO +28 296
>Jeremy: EEIILRT C12 TIE +16 310
#note Quackle loves this play.   Drawing NG would be nice for (sTEEK)ING. Drawing ZO would be nice for 15A ZORI/TIE(R). But I somehow manage to drawa better than that.
>Zev: ALZ 14B Z.AL +26 322
>Jeremy: AEGILLR 1H .ILLAGER +89 399
#note After seeing what I drew I was just careful not to look too excited.  I knew Zev would play at the bottom of the board.
>Zev: ANNOOUX -  +0 322
#note The play is challenged out of desperation, and the game conceded after the word is comes back acceptable.
>Jeremy: T B1 ..T +14 413
#note I would have played this
>Jeremy:  (ANNOOUX) +28 441
