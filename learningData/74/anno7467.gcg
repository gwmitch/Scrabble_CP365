>Mike_Lean: AFFHPTW 8G WAFF +26 26
#note Right move, wrong spot. Should have been 8e, to prevent pluralization. PFFT is a cool word haha
>Ted_Barrett: ?IRRRST K8 STIRReR +76 76
#note Best move
>Mike_Lean: AABHOPT 14J B.OTH +32 58
#note Doesn't rank. FAB J8 best. The leave on my play sucked.
>Ted_Barrett: AIIJNOY 10J J.AO +27 103
#note Ted's actually Mike, and Mike's actually Ted. My bad.
JIAO 15G was best. Yours was 11th
>Mike_Lean: AACEEPP 15G CAPE +28 86
#note Fifth best. PACE in the same spot is higher up, but it seems like CAPE would be better, as both take an S front hook, but you can't utilize the TLS horizontally with an overlap with CAPE
>Ted_Barrett: HIINNOY O10 HINNY +26 129
#note 4th best. YONI 7F best by 3%
>Mike_Lean: AAEKNPT 12I PA.K +20 106
#note Best play by 3%
>Ted_Barrett: GIMOORT 15L MOO +22 151
#note Best move by .5%
>Mike_Lean: AEILNOT 7B ELATION +67 173
#note Best move.
>Ted_Barrett: AEGIRTZ B4 GAZ. +34 185
#note ZAIRE A4 scored 80 and was best by 10% over next best, GAZE A7. All ranked plays were on the triple
>Mike_Lean: ?CDMOSW C3 MOW +24 197
#note 11th. DOW 8B was best
>Ted_Barrett: EEILRRT D4 RET.ILER +82 267
#note LITTERER E4 was better by 1%. I assume because it doesn't leave a DWS pluralization, no AWE back hook, and doesn't open DLS to the right of the second R.
>Mike_Lean: ?CDGINS F9 CoDINGS +73 270
#note Thought DISCING/DELATION, but forgot delation. pwnt
>Ted_Barrett: DGIORTU A7 GOURD +30 297
#note DI(T) E5 is significantly better
>Mike_Lean: ADEEEIO E4 EDI. +33 303
#note Best play by over 5%. Yay :D
>Ted_Barrett: BEEIITU C10 BITE +18 315
>Ted_Barrett: BEEIITU --  -18 297
#note Mike likes Spanish
>Mike_Lean: AEEEOUV -AEEOUV +0 303
#note AVENUE 13C was ideal. Everything else sort of sucked
>Ted_Barrett: BEEIITU C10 BEET +18 315
#note BE(GAZE) B2 for 40 dominates. BEET doesn't rank. Almost all of the ranked plays are through the two parallels of retailer and codings*
>Mike_Lean: ADEESTX F1 AXED +35 338
#note Guess ADEESTX + U.
>Ted_Barrett: AEIIOUV 1F .VO +18 333
#note 13E ENVOI is 23.79%, 2E EXUVIA is 20.45%, then there are 5 different exchanges of 5-7 tiles ranging from 17.58% to 16.29%
>Mike_Lean: EENSSTY B12 YES +19 357
#note Almost ranks.
>Ted_Barrett: AEIILUU A13 LEU +14 347
#note Fifth best. AUTO M12
>Mike_Lean: ELNNSTV 3F .VENT +13 370
#note "Here comes the gay bingo." Too bad I had the N instead of the A. This play's analysis is taking forever. This is some intense endgame sh*t! My play isn't ranked. Oh darn.
>Ted_Barrett: AIIIQUU E12 QUA +28 375
#note Highest scoring play. No shot at winning.
>Mike_Lean: AELNS 4H LEANS +19 389
>Mike_Lean:  (IIIU) +8 397
