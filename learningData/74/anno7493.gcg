>Winter: AIRRUUV 8H URARI +12 12
#note OMG, Brad is going to get more revenge on me like in Maine. 
I know Quack exch, but I don't care. I'm not about to give up my chance at momentum and let Brad score and easy 20-30.

#note Whoa, maybe not dead after all.
>Bradley_WhitmarSh: AI 12K .AI +6 37
#note Okay, here he comes!!!
>Winter: EEHJMMT 7E THEM +15 110
#note I wanted to block as many lines as I could, but I still totally whiffed on HMM. Quack likes (E)MMET but I'm not opening like that after Brad telegraphs a bingo rack. Let him bingo on N so I can get a comeback. Actually, I want to score with my comeback, so keeping an intermediate point tile might be good.

>Winter: ABEFLMR D4 FAB +33 207
#note I should have played FLAMBE(E), but no way on FLAB or FLAM--why make it easy for Brad. Quack values that leave too much on this closed board (although Brad is sure to open it).
>Bradley_WhitmarSh: FHO F2 FOH +30 130

#note Damn missed some good overlaps!!!

>Bradley_WhitmarSh: ACDEIL 15C CA.ELID +39 237
#note Uh-oh. I let him get too close. He might actually manage a win despite my blank!!!
>Winter: ?EIOTTZ 14D Z.O +29 276
#note Although... his play actually helped me out, b/c otherwise I play (BO)ZO and give up more points.
>Bradley_WhitmarSh: DEL 6G DEL +13 250
>Winter: ?AEIPTT G1 TAP +23 299
#note CANNOT PLAY THE BINGO--HE MIGHT GET (F)UNNIEST. Also, the Q stick. I don't think I can lose if he doesn't bingo, what what if I get Q and C stuck, and he finds some good scores.
>Bradley_WhitmarSh: NU 13G NU +8 258
#note Going for the Q stick. If I don't have the blank, this would have won it for him.
>Winter: ?EIIQST 2F ..QIr +16 315
#note Quack likes its, but I don't see where I ditch the Q if he plays D(AG) or Y(AG).
>Bradley_WhitmarSh: CDENTWY 3I DEWY +19 277

#note DAMN MISSED THE C SPOT B/C OF THE BLANK R!!!
