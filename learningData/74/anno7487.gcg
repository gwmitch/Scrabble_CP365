>moh: DEEFKVV I3 KEF +25 121
#note Extremely tricky spot. It's almost never right to keep VV, but I think this is one of those rare cases. No matter what I play (barring an exchange), I keep very heavy, inflexible tiles, so I decided that KEF was the fastest route out of the drek since playing a single V on my next play should get me out of the woods. And with a little luck, I might even be able to play both Vs. It obviously doesn't hurt that KEF scores pretty well.
>dave: AEILRST 13E TAILERS +69 138
#note Dave's last two plays telegraphed bingo-proneness, so this was pretty much expected. There are 11 possible bingos here.
>moh: DEELPVV L4 VELD +28 149
#note F12 V(A)V is a solid play (while it opens up a huge spot for an -S hook, it's a defensive wash since VAV also kills the big parallel plays that hit 14F hard (any play slotting a Y, H, W, or X at 14F, especially if they span all the way over to 14B)). That said I prefermy play, mostly because it scores so much more.
>dave: IOO H12 O.IO +15 153
>moh: EINOPTV 14B PIVOT +30 179
#note Best. Unfortunately, no M for PIVOT(M)EN.
>dave: EGO M7 EGO +14 167
>moh: EHNNPTT G2 PHT +18 197
#note I don't remember why I decided against F6 TEN(C)H, but that's the best play since it undoubles my TT and NN while scoring well (I think I wanted to keep at least one vowel, but in retrospect that was a bad reason since NPT is at least as good a leave as ENNT).
>dave: ADERRSU N9 RASURED +72 239
>dave: ADERRSU --  -72 167
#note This is where Dave really blew the game. He had pretty good tiles and should have nursed them to a bingo. Instead he tried a phony that he knew I'd know whether or not it's good (there just aren't any tile combinations that are in the same neighborhood probabilistically as ADERRSU where I would not know WITH CERTAINTY whether they made a word or not. It's hard for newer players to appreciate that (and maybe it sounds boastful to mention it, but that's just part of what it means to really master this game; there's nothing special about me that's not also true of every other expert), but Dave knows there is simply no way that I wouldn't know whether RASURED was good or not (RASURES is, by the way)). [I've got to stop it with all the bested parenteticals.]

>dave: ADERRSU C12 RU.. +8 175
>moh: EEINOTX 8M .OX +33 245
>dave: ?ADERSW 15G D.WAgERS +62 237
#note This is one of thse cases where it's strategically best for Dave not to bingo. The available bingos are just too meager; that means he's not getting full value for his blank. Since he's behind by a full bingo, and since there are multiple lanes to bingo through, it's actually best for him to wait a turn with somehin like 12A WA(R)D. For the record, I would not recommend foregoing bingos as a newer player since it's almost always right to take the points (and since a newer player won't find all the bingos on future racks to pay it back).
>moh: BEEINQT H1 QI +37 282
#note That missed turn is killing Dave right now, allowing me to take a comfortable lead. It's slightly better strategically to play QI at J2 (since playing it in my spot allows possible bingos from 1H; when you're leading late, the fewer bingo lanes, the better).
>dave: AENO 14L AEON +16 253
>moh: BEEINTY D9 BYTE +22 304
#note 11C BYTE is better. I'm suspicious of the computer sim winner 12A BY(R)E.
>dave: EGGJU 6C JUGGE. +20 273
>moh: DEHINRZ E4 ZI. +26 330
#note E3 ZIN(G)ED is much better.
>dave: AN 10B AN. +8 281
#note Dave's play is an empty threat since no remaining tiles will front hook ANY. I'm not sure if he realized that at the time, but I certainly did.
>moh: DEFHNNR 4C FE. +30 360
#note This should seal it as long as Dave doesn't bingo from the Q (remember the point I made abou QI being betterat J2. Now it's the difference in winning 100% of the time 87% of the time).
>dave: ACEINRS C3 I. +10 291
>moh: ADEHNNR J2 HA +19 379
#note There are now no possible Q bingos given the remaining tiles (since SQUINTER won't play). I didn't think there were, but I blocked anyway, just in case I mistracked or missed something.
