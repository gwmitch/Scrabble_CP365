#note vector or octavo are a little better. OPE seems ridiculous to me; maybe i completely underestimated the usefulness of COATER, but i have a feeling there's a large bias in equity/win% from drawing caveator/cavorter/cavorted and the static player not blocking it. does anyone else think this is a 17 pt equity mistake? cuz i definitely don't. still, coater should result in a bingo very often, i should have at least considered it.

#note pealike is sorta awesome, i think i woulda played it if i'd seen it. i really wanted another chance at an A, but ZAP is right anyway.

#note the problem with very good players is that this will always result in a bingo next turn (i've played carl and joe and other people who make moves like this and never miss, which i don't understand since even the best fishes are only like 75-80% successful most of the time)
