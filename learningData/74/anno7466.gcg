#note DK: HOMIE sims far better than anything else.

#note DW: A phoney! It looked ugly, but I just didn't quite have the confidence to challenge. Bad mistake.
>Bing: ADELNQR L11 ELAND +30 53
>Dave: ?EIINOS 15E lIONISE. +74 177
#note DK: This is probably better than VISIONED for not giving easy XI/QI plays, though of course it may allow big plays from 14B.  I like RESINOID most, which I didn't think of during the game.
>Bing: DEEEIQR F14 Q. +31 84
>Dave: FNNRSTT 8J R.FT +13 190
#note Exchanging might seem to be called for here, but the 8L-8O spot was the one place on the board he was most likely to get a big score, so I thought it was worth taking it out.

>Dave: ABNNSTT N7 B.NT +8 198
#note DK: Quackle comes up with the nice BANYAN that I didn't think of, but my play is thematic.  The board is tight and the N and O columns are the best spots for him to bingo.  His last play suggests a strong rack.  Afterward, Dave told me that I blocked DERELICT.
>Bing: CEEILRT 6C LICE +14 128
#note DW: Missed ELECTRUM H1.
>Dave: AANOSTU M8 .AUT +16 214
>Bing: EEERSTT O1 RETESTE. +84 212
#note DK: Suddenly, he's right back in the game, though I've still got the tempo and some good tiles.
>Dave: AANOPSZ J6 Z..O +34 248
>Bing: AABCOWX N2 WAB +32 244
>Dave: AANOPRS M2 APO +31 279
#note DK: I was set to play PA M13 before his play, but now this was the biggest hot spot.
>Bing: AACDOTX D2 ATAX.C +30 274
#note DW: Hoping to draw an S, or at least an I for ODIC.
DK: I'm glad he didn't have an I for ATAXIC 1H.
>Dave: AIKLNRS M13 KA +34 313
>Bing: DNORRVY 2B OV.RY +38 312
>Dave: AILNRSS E4 SI. +30 343
#note DK: I couldn't remember if ATAXICS was good, but with all the remaining S's, I didn't have to worry about him going there, nor about the SLICE hook.  By refusing to play there at all, I make it very hard for him to open the board more.

#note DK: If I'd remembered NAPA and ATAXICS, AN O14 followed by LINS 8A would be the way to milk the most points in this endgame.
