#note considered 4h FID(G)ET leaving ES or j1 F(O)ETID. i thought on this board that the ED may prove more fruitful and SOFTIE scores more

#note ok - i'm within 9 after this play. Q likes HON in the same spot.  anyone know why? i couldnt figure it out in the 3mins i had left
>debbie: EPS 13C ESP. +30 370
>jc: ADENORT I4 .O +2 333
#note dropping the O is the right idea, but dropping ON at 13b is better. or 5k (O)OT.    It was hard for me in the time i had to try and work through this pre-endgame...
>debbie: D 9B D... +12 382
#note this leaves one in the bag, debbie obviously sees i'm gunning for the DJIN hook........  it's worth trying to work out my best play on my next move.
>jc: ADENRRT K13 ..R +5 338
#note i failed here. i have a one in 8 chance if i get rid of the N leaving ADERRT.  The E gives me REDREA(M)T or RETARDE(D).  i figured in the time left to uncouple the R - missing BURKER as more anyway.
