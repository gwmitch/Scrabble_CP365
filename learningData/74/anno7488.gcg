>eb94: EENORSS -  +0 0
#note Saw SENORES at first but doubted it, so I passed
>Mikelean02: ?ADIIOT -DIO +0 0
#note 8E IDIOT, then 8D OIDIA for .11% less
>eb94: EENORSS 8C SENORES +66 66
#note Finally played it. :/
>Mikelean02: ?ABHILT C1 HALIBuT. +76 76
#note Top was TITHABLE H1, then HITTABLE H1. Mike's play was 9th. (Actually seventh because two of the choices only vary the location of the blank)
>eb94: AADNNRW D2 WAN +23 89
#note Best move
>Mikelean02: CILQTTX 6B Q.ILT +35 111
#note Best my 3.5% over XI B6 for 51
>eb94: ADNRSYZ B2 RAY +33 122
#note troShould have played YAR instead of RAY in retrospect. YAR B2 would have been best, my play was B2
>Mikelean02: CEGOTUX 9D XU +20 131
#note UGH 1A was best. That would have been sick. Third best move here, but still 10% worse that top
>eb94: DNOPSUZ I3 ZOUND. +28 150
#note EXPOUND D8 by far. ZOUNDS is third best
>Mikelean02: ?CEEGOT -  +0 131
#note Challenged.
>eb94: AAEPRSV J2 PAR +24 174
#note AVA J1 was best. PAR was seventh best.
>Mikelean02: CEGILOT K1 CIG +23 154
#note Messed up on the rack last time. This is the right rack. (E)CLOGITE H8 is the only bingo.
>eb94: AEISUVV 1K .AVES +33 207
#note EXUVIAE D8. Damn. 1K CAVIE would have been the best move where I played, but I didn't know that word. Fifth best move.
>Mikelean02: EIILOTU -IILOU +0 154
#note OUTLIE 5H. 6th best move was Mike's exchange
>eb94: DEIOOUV M1 .IVE +20 227
#note D8 EXODOI was best, but I don't know that. Sixth best play
>Mikelean02: AACEKMT L4 MACK +32 186
#note Best move, champ.
>eb94: DDIIOOU -DDIOOU +0 227
#note Still EXODOI is best. 10th best move
>Mikelean02: AEGINST O1 .EATINGS +80 266
#note Best move
>eb94: AEEGIMO A3 GAE +18 245
#note Best move!
>Mikelean02: DILOPRR -DILOPR +0 266
#note PURDA 5H, then IDOL M7. Exchanging wasn't on there
>eb94: EEIMOTT F2 MOTE. +13 258
#note ETH 1A best. My play was third best
>Mikelean02: FHLNORR G3 FOH +29 295
#note Best play by 2%
>eb94: DEIIPTY G7 P.IED +12 270
#note EXITED D8. First move so far that didn't rank. I liked it because it was a decent scoring play, and opened a tls for my y because the only other medium-scoring were BFW out of 21 tiles. I didn't see the other B in the bag :/
>Mikelean02: BLNNORR F10 BORN +25 320
#note Best play
>eb94: AEIITUY E11 YEA +30 300

#note 10F BEDROLL. 7th best play
>eb94: DEFIITU 15A FID +26 326
#note Fourth best. Dif was better there (durrr) but third. number one was TIDE 15A
>Mikelean02: DJLORTW 12A JOLT.. +42 377
#note Best play. You win.
>eb94: EEEIITU N8 ETUI +8 334
#note NIECE 6I is best, but everything loses. My play was dumb in my review
>Mikelean02: ?DORUW 12J WORDs +20 397
