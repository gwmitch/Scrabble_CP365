>moh: ADEELUV 8B DEVALUE +80 80
#note The only bingo. Pretty obvious.
>seth: DEJNNRY -YNN +0 0
#note This is definitely not an exchange rack. C7 J(E)NNY is scores well and keeps the promising DER rack. Taking the DEVALUE-D hook with something like NERDY isn't a terrible idea either, although I don't like keeping the J if I don't have to. Speaking of which, it's very rarely right to keep the J on an exchange. The J is a clunky bingo-killer, and it ruins a lot of racks. Sure, its 8-point face value leads to some high-scoring plays, but its clunkiness will cost you more in the long run than its face value will earn you.
>moh: ADEILNT H1 DATELIN. +80 160
#note There are tons of bingos here. I should have found the 2x2 E4 DENT(A)LIA, but I didn't really look once I saw that I could play to the 3WS.
>seth: DEIJORS C7 J.E +19 19
#note Your two goals here should be to keep the most bingo-prone leave possible while scoring with your J. The easiest ways to accomplish that are by tripling the J with 2F JI(A)O or F6 JO(L)E. When you're close to a bingo, keeping an E is critical, so I'd chose JIAO over JOLE. 
>moh: ?HOOTTV 5H .OTH +14 174
#note F6 VO(L)T is best, although all of the reasonable plays are pretty close.
>seth: ?DEIORS I8 StEROID +70 89
#note Lots of bingo options here, and StEROID was fine. It's probably best to try to triple your bingo with something like InDORSE(D) or (D)ISRObED. That said, a bingo is a bingo, so I wouldn't overthink this one.
>moh: ?BCOTUV E5 VOC.B +24 198
#note VOC(A)B is best.
>seth: IINOPTT 10H P.TITION +64 153
#note The only bingo. Very nice.
>moh: ?ASTUXZ 9K TAX +39 237
#note Close, but TUX is in the same spot is obviously better. Other possibilities include 15E TAXUS and 6B ZA.
>seth: ACDFINN 6B FA +24 177
#note You had the right idea, but it's better to get rid of at least on of those Ns with FAN(O) or FAN(O)N in the same spot as your play. My favorite play (although it's tough to find and involves a strange word) is G2 FINCA.
>moh: ?BHRSUZ G2 HUB +21 258
#note I should have gone ahead and taken that STEROID-S hook with something like BRUSH.
>seth: CDEINNP O8 PI.ED +30 207
#note Again, so close! You definitely want to get rid of one of those Ns, so O7 PIN(N)ED edges out PINED.
>moh: ?FMQRSZ L8 Q.. +22 280
#note Q(AT) is fine. Other decent options are 12H F(O)RMS 28 and 15E ZaRFS 56.
>seth: CEGNN 2F C..NGE +22 229
#note You didn't record your full rack, so I'm not sure what's best. C(HA)NG is better than C(HA)NGE though, unless you had way too many vowels (unlikely given your last known leave of CNN).
>moh: ?FMORSZ 1K FORMS +38 318
#note L1 FROM is a little better than 1K FORMS since it keeps that critical S (which I want to use to get my Z on the triple along row 15). 12H Z(O)OMS scores well, but I don't like it as much as FROM.
>seth: AEINRRS 15G RESIN +23 252
#note This is just one of those racks that you learn from playing. When you see RAINERS*, play SIERRAN (which would have gone down along row 15). (D)RAINERS was also available along column B. It's not generally worth breaking up a rack as bingo-prone as this one unless you're scoring a ton or there is a very compelling strategic reason for doing so.
>moh: ?AEIUYZ F8 .AZY +40 358
#note Best.
>seth: AGKNRRY L12 RANK +41 293
>seth: AGKNRRY --  -41 252
#note RESINY is good, so you could have played in the same spot without a phony. RESINK* is not a bad try, and you'd probably get away with it against Harry, Carl, Sue, etc.
>moh: ?AEILMU 14A ALUMInE +68 426
#note My bingo was fine, but there was a doozy possible: 11A MULtI(Y)EA(R)!
>seth: AGKNRRY A12 GR.Y +30 282
#note Here we see the importance of all those weird fours: KY(A)R or KN(A)R are better than GR(A)Y. That said, GRAY is a fine play if you don't know those words.
>moh: AGLNOSU 11D GU. +14 440
#note There's really no standout play here since LANUGOS won't play. Options include 14I (D)OULAS, N1 (M)UNGO, and M1 (R)UGOLA.
>seth: AEIKNRW N1 .ARK +20 302
>moh: AELNOST 15G .....ATES +30 470
#note My play wins the computer sim. Normally you would not want to break up a great bingo rack like this, but the board is basically dead for bingos, so I might as well take the points for RESINATES. (I looked it up, and RESINATE is a verb meaning 'to treat with resin'.)
>seth: AEINORW 14M AWE +26 328
#note Lots of plays are even here, with yours among them.
>moh: EILNOOW 12H W.OLIE +26 496
#note I think the optimum endgame sequence would begin with 13K LOWE, but it only makes a two-point difference from my play.
>seth: INOR O4 IN +10 338
>moh: NO 12D ON +12 508
#note Good game.
>moh:  (OR) +4 512
