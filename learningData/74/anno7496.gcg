>Tunnicliffe: DEEHMTY 8H THYME +28 28
#note Or at 8D? I dunno how I feel about giving up the possible (THYME)MACHINE extension.
>Lipkin: AJ J6 JA. +29 29
>Tunnicliffe: CDEEHIR L3 CHEER.D +26 54
#note Seth said he would have challenged CHEDERIM*, which I was so sure of. Anyways, I botched this rack. I was unsure of MICHE and and fishes are unintuitive. (M)I sims well.
>Lipkin: AFGIORS H1 ISOGRAF. +92 121
>Tunnicliffe: IKRRSTW 3J WI.K +26 80
#note Or WORK? I felt I already needed to take the points and pray for good draws.

>Tunnicliffe: LNPQRST 11C TR.NQ +14 301
#note This was a tough position. (Though you wouldn't know it by the way I windmilled TRANQ in a heartbeat). The top-simming play is L(E)PT(I)N, which I did not see. I guess it makes sense: pick a vowel to exploit the Q at the 12D lane. By the way, TRANQUILIZERS is still possible at this point.
>Lipkin: ADIT 14J A.DIT +22 307
>Tunnicliffe: AELLOPS O12 POSE +34 335
#note Aah... I do not know ASLOPE, but that would have been excellent at N2. That's a big drop in win% from 61 to 50.
>Lipkin: FZ M13 F.Z +30 337
>Tunnicliffe: ?AALLOU 14C ALULA +11 346
#note CP didn't pick it, but it sims to the top with a 83% win chance. I dunno. My plan is to win by playing out next turn. Man, this was a tough position.
>Lipkin: ADIOPST 15A SPAIT +31 368
>Tunnicliffe: ?BNOW -  +0 346
#note No way to win, so I challenge SPAIT. BWN was a tough draw. Seth played the endgame perfectly.
>Lipkin: DO K5 DO +22 390
>Lipkin:  (BNOW?) +18 408
