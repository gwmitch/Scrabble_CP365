>Lou: CFHIN H4 FINCH +34 34
>Joey: DEEMNOX 4H .EDEX +32 32
#note FOXED seemed a little more dangerous than FEDEX.
>Lou: ADELQU 5E QUA.LED +79 113
#note FEDEX seemed a little more dangerous than FOXED.
>Joey: AMNOOOP 3K POMO +31 63
#note Interestingly, POO may be slightly better.  AMNO is quite a bit more dynamic than just ANO.
>Lou: BELT 2L BELT +32 145
>Joey: AEELNOU E5 .UALE +14 77
>Lou: AIRV 8A VIRA. +27 172
>Joey: ACEINOY I8 OY +14 91
#note It looks like something more exciting should be available, but there isn't.
>Lou: ADEGNRT B3 TREAD.NG +66 238
#note At least Frank didn't have to deal with this.
>Joey: ACEIJNU A1 JEU +32 123
#note Lou had nearly committed to playing GRANTED, but then noticed that it would have formed HOR.  I may not have even noticed, because I was all ready to pounce with JAUNDICE.
>Lou: ?EIILOT G8 OILIEsT +63 301
>Joey: ACIINNZ 11F Z.NNIA +30 153
#note I guess ZINE 11D is a little better, but my prospects weren't looking good.
>Lou: GGWW -GGWW +0 301
>Joey: CEINORY J4 ..Y +15 168
>Lou: AEEPRRT 10J PARE +24 325
#note Lou said he talked himself out of PATTERER.  That would have really screwed up my next play.
>Joey: CEINORT D8 .NORETIC +78 246
>Lou: ?AEMORT N5 TOnEARM +71 396
#note Scored as only 70.  He's showing me some mercy.
>Joey: GGHOSVW 8L VO.S +33 279
>Lou: FIST 12L FIST +25 421
>Joey: DGGHIRW 14B WR.GH. +42 321
#note It wasn't worth going for HAWFINCH again.
>Lou: AEK C2 KAE +22 443
>Joey: BDGIINW O12 .WIG +24 345
>Lou: AOSSU H14 SO +20 463
#note Scored as 22, meaning that this game had more scoring errors than the previous 14 combined.  Still, it was only a net loss of 1 point for me.
>Joey: BDIN 14K BIND. +16 361
#note On a lighter note, Lou was due for a game like this against me.  Really fun guy to play, regardless of the outcome.
>Joey:  (ASU) +6 367
