#note Okay, now it looks good, since I can score, but with all those power tiles still left, I can't assume anything if Tony hits that TLS and also has the G.

#note Want to burn three tiles to reduce Tony's chances of taking any tiles he might use to catch up, unlikely as it is, but don't want to empty bag. I hate Z(IT). A bingo is extremely unlikely, and I don't need the spread--just need to lock down the win.
