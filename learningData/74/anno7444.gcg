#note 11E T(A)ENIAE for 28 is pretty obvious. Ugh.
>glenda: DHO E11 HOD +24 104
>moh: DEEIINY 13C NE.DY +28 105
#note I avoided the obvious YID because of Glenda played an S on her previous play (which indicates a higher likelihood she's got another one).

#note Very weird positon. The best play is probably (SAUTE)RNE along the bottom row. K2 Q(I) is also reasonable, as are my play and 12G AX.
>glenda: FO 14A OF +22 164
>moh: AEIMNQX K2 Q. +11 154
#note I think shedding the Q has to be right. 2M MAX gives up way too much on the response for my liking.
>glenda: C 9E C.. +8 172
>moh: ?AEIMNX 9I AX +22 176
#note I really didn't like this play since Glenda has telegraphed bingo-proneness (and it gives her the perfect lane). But there just really aren't a lot of options (maybe now is the time for 2M MAX?).
>glenda: ?EIRSST K8 RESISTs +72 244
>moh: ?EIIMNT 8K .EMIT +24 200
#note A7 pIMIENT(OS) is the star play!
>glenda: ADEGHIO 10H EGI. +31 275
#note While EGI(S) scores well, I think Glenda really must kill the bingo lanes through REMIT. I don't know her full rack, so I can't say what play might have been best.
>moh: ?EIINRW O5 WIN.rIER +61 261
#note The only bingo.

#note LATIN* is a phony . Ugh. GREEK is good, by the way.
>moh: BCELOTU L7 C.L +16 308
#note 6C OUT(JUMPS) is best.
>glenda: OO 7L .OO. +14 326
>moh: BDEIOTU 2M TOD +15 323
#note I like TOD because there is no combination of unseen tiles that can play a two at 1N, but there are several draws that allow me to play there. 
>glenda: ELU 12K .LU.. +16 342
>glenda: ELU --  -16 326
#note There is no reason for Glenda to get desperate enough to try a phony like this here.
>moh: ABEIRU 15I BA +15 338
#note This is a very tricky endgame. I actually consided 12B BU(BO) during the game, and I actually think it's probably the best play.
>glenda: DGLNNNU E7 DU. +10 336
>glenda: DGLNNNU --  -10 326
#note Seriously?
>moh: EIRU 1N RE +18 356
#note I took the points even though I saw that I might get stuck with an I.
>glenda: DGLNNNU 4I L. +7 333
>moh: IU M13 .U +2 358
>glenda: DGNNNU 15M NUN +12 345
#note Glenda can actually win here if she realizes that I'm I-stuck. She just needs to avoid giving me a place for my I, which means holding off on 15M NUN until it's her out-play. (something like G(OR), D(OM), N(AE), and then NUN for the out)
