>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELMOST E4 MEnT.OLS +98 98
#note I chewed up a lot of time here. There's one more 2x2 - LOT(H)SoME, and I didn't know that spelling variant.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ADEOORV 10A OVER.OAD +72 94
>Matthew_Larocque: AAADRTY H10 .ATARY +33 131
#note RAYA D3 isn't far behind.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEUZ 14E AZU.E +34 128
>Matthew_Larocque: AADENPY 15A PANDY +44 175
#note Again, slightly edging out the runner-ups. Scored as 43.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: INQU A8 QU.IN +45 173
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIKU 14A UKE +32 207
#note The night before, Juraj had talked about the 30 point threshold. Meaning, he'd take 30 points regardless of the leave. Figures... I run into that exact situation in our game. But I missed U(M)IAK!
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEHO 13B OHED +42 215
#note Ouch. Juraj killed that spot.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIIIV D1 VIGA +32 239
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EGLNRST 11G T.NGLERS +70 285
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILOW 1A WEE.IL +36 275
#note No more dees left for the extention. I thought -ING might also be valid so I kept an eye out for the last G.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AABBIST 7G ABBATIS +73 358
#note Ugh. I wasn't familiar with this word at all. I should have realised that it was going to be difficult to bingo if this stays and that there's too many places to score for me to catch up. I was worried he'd kill the L8 spot with one of the efs if I lost my turn. Stupid stupid stupid. I could have won this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: INNORSW 13G N.W +23 298
#note Sim likes 8L NOWS which forces him to kill the S. Maybe I should gamble and just play NOW? If he can't hook it, he'll have to block it for pennies.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEX 12K AXE +42 400
#note 6 of his 8 turns have been 40+ points, and only 1 was less than 30.
>Matthew_Larocque: CINORRS M9 CO..R +20 318
#note Most of my timer was used up here. I was debating this or C(A)R, but it seemed unlikely that I would draw a bingo that would actually fit making SC(A)R. I was still paranoid about the efs, but I think I needed to leave it alone and cross my fingers. Sim likes IRON(I)C, but it looks pretty hopeless either way. I had to make that challenge.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ILNO F3 LINO +16 416
>Matthew_Larocque: FIINRRS 8J RIF +23 341
#note I was unsure about this, blocking these letters and all, but sim seems to like it. Still, playing it at G2 for 16 points makes more sense in keeping to board open.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EM J6 M..E +12 428
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IJNPRS 1A ......INg +42 383
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IJNPRS --  -42 341
#note Pretty awful. Not only is this not a word, but even if it was, just play JI(G). Geez. the L seemed like it would be impossible to bingo from with the P on my rack so I kinda just shrugged and did something stupid.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EF 2A EF +25 453
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IJNPRS 6L RaJ +32 373
#note Scored as 31.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CEGIOTU 4C G...C +10 463
>Matthew_Larocque: INPS 14M SIP +18 391
#note Juraj blocked the out I saw. I missed my other out, among many other superior plays like B6 PSI.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIOTU O12 TO.I +21 484
>Matthew_Larocque: N A1 ..N +6 397
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EU) +4 401
#note Good job to Juraj. There's usually at least one game per tourny where I get phonied and lose, maybe I'll stop being lazy and study some words haha.
