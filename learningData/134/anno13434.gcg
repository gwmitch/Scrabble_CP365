#note I had a lot of these almost bingo opening racks in this tourney.  I liked this play to set up my S.

>Dave_Koenig: AEGMOPQ 15G POME +29 125
#note QAT right away is possible, but then he is likely to get big plays on row 15.  The idea here is to take away the scoring spot and hope to hit QAT on the next turn.  MOPE instead possibly sets up a second spot for QAT if I draw a T, but also makes it easier for him to bingo in response.

>Dave_Koenig: AAEGPQT 7F QAT +19 144
>Evans_Clinchy: EILU 14D LIEU +10 89
>Dave_Koenig: AAEGIOP D8 APOGEA. +22 166
#note Tough call here.  Before LIEU I was all set to play the defensive AIA 15M, which doesn't have a great leave but seriously cuts down his scoring possibilities.  However with the additional scoring possibilities at 15A, it didn't seem worth playing so defensively and keeping EGOP.  Instead, I play to clean this rack out quickly and try to beat him to the blanks and S's.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEHNSX O8 HEXENES +117 206
>Evans_Clinchy: CDRU (challenge) +5 211
#note Umm, maybe I should have played AIA after all.  Nice play, Evans.
>Dave_Koenig: EIINRUW E9 IWI +27 193
#note IWI# is one of the most useful words in CSW.  It bails you out of a bad rack so many times.

>Dave_Koenig: EFJNRRU 8A JUR. +33 226
>Evans_Clinchy: EIINRSU A6 IN.URIES +66 298
#note "You're welcome," I said to Evans, after he bingoed through the J I gave him.
>Dave_Koenig: AEEFNRZ B5 EF +26 252
#note Much more important to create an opening up top than get point greedy with FEU.  Also, this is better than playing more tiles, which would allow him to play parallel on the A or C column and close down the lane more easily.  It's hard for him to take away the row 4 hook without giving me something else.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIOR 4A AROID +20 318
>Dave_Koenig: ?AENRSZ 3C ZA +46 298
#note I saw PANZERS, but this is a much better play.  This is frequently the case when you have a big tile like a Z or X with the blank.  If you've got a big short play with the power tile and can keep bingoish tiles with the blank, you'll score more by splitting them.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADEKOR 2B hARDOKE +91 409
#note Another nice CSW-only bingo from Evans.
>Dave_Koenig: ?ENRSTY 1H YeSTERN +95 393
>Evans_Clinchy: ELM 1A MEL +29 438
#note This is a nice scoring play, which he needs in a close endgame, but if he thought carefully about what I could have in response, he might have had to reconsider.
>Dave_Koenig: BBCOOOY 13C C.BBY +56 449
#note What's amazing is that not only do I have this huge scoring play, but with my OOO leave I also go out faster than him.
