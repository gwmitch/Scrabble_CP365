#note Not good. I missed the easy APOD, and even just ADZ is fine. Not sure why I wanted to take points and keep a blah leave.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABORTWY 10J YOW +32 120
#note Wasn't sure if it was worth passing up BAWTY to keep the board bingo prone. So often, Jeremy just pounces on YOWE immediately, so this might not be worth it.

#note I'm totally blind to COHOST. Luckily I don't think it was relevant with what I had, but it certainly could have been.

#note Nervous about giving him the easy overlaps on the M column, but I thought TESTY was worse.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AHLU O11 L.HUA +24 283
#note Whoa, COHOS also takes an H.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EMOPRU 10E OP +27 342
#note Now, the top-simming play is B1 OP, which I actually saw and placed on the board. But then I realized he could have TSADI/TSADE there for 39. I still win in that case, but it involves me not screwing up next turn. (Finding NEURoMA as the only out.) In any case, I can't see many endgames where OP here loses.
