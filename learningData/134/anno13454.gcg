>Jason_Idalski: AG 8H AG +6 6
>JD: BILNNOR 9H BORN +15 15
#note INBORN at J5 has oddly good defense. I couldn't remember if it was good. In response to a short play like AG played after a couple of minutes of deliberation INBORN becomes even better because most of the bingoes will be worth much less.
>Jason_Idalski: AEIPRSW L4 WASPIER +83 89
#note exactly like this
>JD: ?IIILNZ 5I ILI. +8 23
#note usually when you have a blank priority #1 is to bingo as soon as possible, but I felt pretty good about going for either a big bingo or scoring with the Z and then bingoing the turn after that.

>JD: ?CCEILQ -CQ +0 134
#note looks like I need to listen to more kanye...this is a bad miss. clique clique clique...also it's interesting that keeping CCEIL? is actually better than CEIL?. anyway, ugly miss

#note I wanted to hold onto the A more than the I. it's within a point on a sim.

#note I could play QIS but INDORSE really seems to shut the board down.
>Jason_Idalski: DFI 13L FID +19 307
>JD: EHKRSSV F3 H.S +25 389
#note tough play - I should've seen the risk of a big bingo like CLUTTER and blocked, since that's really the only way he could win here.
>Jason_Idalski: BELRTTU 14J BUTTER +42 349
#note I was pretty scared when CLUTTER was still in the bag and trying to see if I could still steal a win. I actually found my best play - CREAKS through B10 which TIES! fortunately for me, in this world the C is in the bag.
