#note passing up some ponts to make this play, but...
>JD: AEEISST 7F .A.E +12 128
#note oh dear, I thought he had blocked my only bingo, but BEASTIES is good. I saw it and thought I was being stupid. ugh. quackle likes ES at 3B as a fish, which makes sense although it may do worse against a human opponent who will block the top-right of the board.
