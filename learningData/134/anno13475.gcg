>dacrON: ?AEFIST 6J FA +33 61
#note CBB: Maybe it's a bit early to get desparate, but I thought it might be worth it to go for the 3x3. He's just drawn 7 new tiles, so there's not guarantee he will block it, especially because Jesse is willing to take risks.
>Jesse_Day: AGHMNOR M2 HM +27 195
#note JD: his last play seemed like bad news...MHO would've been a smart way to block the 3x3 and turn over an extra tile.

>Jesse_Day: AEIRUYY F4 YAY +32 301
#note JD: well, this was the moment of truth...I didn't like playing YARER because if he bingoes I'm up 60 with IUY...seemed like bad news. but I probably should play YARER anyway given the potential 3x3...
>dacrON: AELNPRT A8 PARL.NTE +140 307
>Jesse_Day: AEIRUWX 8L XI +36 337
#note wow, game on. I had no idea what to do here. quackle likes WAXIER. I saw it but drawing to a bare U seemed bad.

>Jesse_Day: AEOORUW B5 WOOER +16 353
#note this play sucks. OUZO would be way better.

>Jesse_Day: ACDIINU A1 UNCIA +29 382
>dacrON: CJNNSVV -CNNVV +0 376
#note CBB: I have so little idea what the right thing is to do here. I figured that this game would come down to scoring, not bingoing, so keeping the J would make sense...?
>Jesse_Day: DEEEIIO 1K DIO.E +32 414
>dacrON: ?EIJLOS 6D J.. +13 389
#note CBB: Man, Quackle hates me for this. It likes my other considerateds of 9K JOLE, 2J JO, and 9K JO better. This doesn't seem like a bag I want to go very deep into, but I am sacrificing a lot but only playing for 13. Lost again.
>Jesse_Day: ACEEGIV H10 VE.GIE +33 447
#note JD: tough decision between trying to block and taking the points...he doesn't have a lot of places to bingo after something like CAVE or VICE. His bingo percentage after VEGGIE is 35% versus 10% after a blocking play.
>dacrON: ?EIKLOS 2E SOnLIKE +75 464
#note CBB: (N)OSELIKe sims best. Jesse was under a minute, so I just picked this one to give him a consonant. Pool isn't so good and he just played off a lot...(OX)LIKE is pretty sweet too, though risky.
>Jesse_Day: ACENNRV H1 C.AVER +45 492
#note JD: CRAVE/CARVE at C1 is just as good because of what followed...
>dacrON: BEIPQSU 15G B.ES +6 470
#note CBB: So yeah I flat out blew the game here. The problem was that I too was now into my final 30 seconds, and I just didn't know what the score was. I saw he only had (I)NN, and with only 10 seconds on his clock, I figured that there was at least a coin flip's chance he wouldn't see (E)N that quickly, especially because he has a bit of a lead at this point. If I had 30 more seconds on my clock, I'd spot 15H (E)QUIP for the win no problem (and we found it right after the game). But at this point, I just had to play something that appeared to do anything.
>Jesse_Day: NN O1 .N +8 500
#note JD: and now it was my turn to blow the game...I had about 15 seconds, plenty of time to figure out what was up, but only after the game did I find my winning play - EN at 11H for 2 points. He still has EQUIP at 15A but it's not enough.
>dacrON: IPQU 11H .QUIP +32 502
#note CBB: I didn't even have any idea if I'd won after this play.
>dacrON:  (N) +2 504
