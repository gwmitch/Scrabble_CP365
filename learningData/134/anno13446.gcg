#note I stared at this word for two minutes, put it down, sighed, picked it up and then put it back down again. I feel bad because it definitely lured Lila into challenging...but I really didn't think it was good!

#note this seemed like it was worth a shot even though she can block if she has the S. In retrospect a better play would be CUT at 13C, or maybe even just taking the points for SQUAW.

#note I should try to block PINIEST/PINITES/TIEPINS. ACETOUS or TALCOUS both do it but I didn't have time to find them.
