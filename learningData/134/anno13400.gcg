#note I devalue U's too much. 10I WA(N) is fine here.

#note QAT/ONCET is a little better

>Kolton_K: AADESST 13I DATES +23 53
#note 11I SA(C) is best. My play seems okay though.

#note I wanted to defend against 60 point X plays, but this is pretty dangerous.

#note Going to need a lucky draw after this play.

>Kolton_K: ?AEGGUV N6 GU.AG +15 328
#note At the time I thought this was a good play. But it was stupid of me to block the best bingo lanes when I have the blank and a deficit to overcome.
>Daval_D: CEIPR 2B PRICE +26 384
#note Unknowingly giving me another lane.
>Kolton_K: ?AEINRV M13 .I +2 330
#note I spent nearly 8 minutes on this turn. I didn't like any of the plays starting with V at 14L because if I played it right I could stick him with something. All of the words that fit there are to cover spread (0% win). My play actually gives me a 15.48 win%.
