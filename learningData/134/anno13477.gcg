>Matt_Canik: ADEEHRV 7G HAVERED +85 85
>Chris_Schneider: ALMOR 8L MOLA +37 49
#note Sets down MORAL 6J first. 
>Matt_Canik: AINNNPT E2 PINTAN. +18 103
#note INN and PINTANO are simming neck and neck. P(E)NNI seems to be best by about a point.

#note ANALCITE
>Matt_Canik: GILNNTT M7 ..TTLING +22 172
#note Fairly confident I can sneak this by him. Quackle says I earned ~4 equity in doing so. 
>Chris_Schneider: ADOR A5 .OARD +31 242
>Matt_Canik: ADGJOQV 12L Q. +22 194
#note Decided to play just QI for the long-shot pulls of JAGGY, JOGGED, JAGGS. Sim still puts this 4 points behind QADI and JAVA, so I guess I'm just being too cute.
>Chris_Schneider: OOOUUU -OOOUUU +0 242
>Matt_Canik: ADGJOVZ 2J GADJO. +36 230
#note Again, confident I could get this by. Chalk up some more equity. 
>Chris_Schneider: EISW H1 WISE. +38 280
>Matt_Canik: EIUVXYZ F5 .X +50 280
#note Wanna take the points now, hit YUTZ next turn. Quack agrees, by 2 points. 
>Chris_Schneider: HORWY 10J WOR.HY +31 311
>Matt_Canik: EIUUVYZ -IUUVY +0 280
#note I think I have to play JIVY here. I didn't see a good way to play out of EUUZ on the board, but EUUZ just can't be 34 points worse than EZ. Yech.  -7 points. 
>Chris_Schneider: BEGIRST K9 G.B +12 323
#note This was his rack. I really like this play. 
>Matt_Canik: AEEIPUZ M2 .EEZ +40 320
#note JUPE, JEU, JEEZ all piqued my interest, but I'm a Y away from a fucking incredible play with JEEZ. 
>Chris_Schneider: ?EIRSTV -V +0 323
#note He said he held EIRST after GOB and pulled the blank, then decided not to bingo until the bag was empty just to ensure the win. I don't know what he exchanged here, but I can't think of a tile that doesn't entail him missing a bingo. I'll just type it in as a v. 
>Matt_Canik: AAIPUUY D3 .A.PI.Y +42 362
#note RASPILY is no good, apparently, but this is still pretty sexy. 
>Chris_Schneider: I 13L I. +13 336
>Matt_Canik: AEEOUUV 2A VOE +15 377
#note I just have to hope that he's walled himself in, that he can't hit B9 or C9, and that I can outrun. . He's also under a minute on his clock here. 
>Chris_Schneider: F 4L F. +10 346
>Matt_Canik: AEILOUU 9A .UL. +9 386
#note This blocks a lot, but he'll probably bingo out most of the time...
