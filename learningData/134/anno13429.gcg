>Amalan_Iyengar: EFIMOTU H7 M.OU +6 24
#note Me, being mister genious, saw MEOU for 6 and not for 28. This was a terrible play.
>Edward_Zhuang: ?EILNRT I1 LaTRINE +63 117
#note TINkLER/MOCK is the best bingo

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?BEGTTU 3E TUB +16 170
#note This sims second best after TUG.
>Edward_Zhuang: AEPR 4C REAP +18 173
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?DEEGTX 5G EX.TED +28 198
#note I still didn't see the 10F spot, where DEX is the best play. After that, EXITED is best.
>Edward_Zhuang: IP 4K PI +18 191
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADGOUY F10 GAUDY +35 233
#note I finally saw the spot, and this is best.
>Edward_Zhuang: ILO 9H .LIO +5 196
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?DEGHIO 8K HODGE +38 271
#note I see HOGTIED, but it doesn't play. HODGE is the best word, and GEOID is the best good word. HODGEPODGE is good in TWL, not HODGE.
>Edward_Zhuang: AEEIR M8 .EARIE +16 212
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AINOTY L12 OY +19 290
#note OY is best after ATONY. I saw ATONY, but I didn't see that it played there.
>Edward_Zhuang: AZ N6 ZA. +33 245
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AAINTT O6 AT. +16 306
#note rEATTAIN is the only bingo, and I saw it, but I didn't just want to open up that spot for him to use for a lot, given that there were 19 unseen tiles, and 3 S's out. He could easily come back on that spot, so ATE was the play. ATE is simming best.
>Edward_Zhuang: GOW C3 G.OW +16 261
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AINNOT B6 ONANIsT +67 373
#note I was looking for a challenge, an I didn't figure he would challenge NATIONS, so I played ONANIST. HOwever, ANTLION is better with challenges and scoring off of the triple in regard to that. ACTINON is the best play.
>Edward_Zhuang: NOS A6 SON +23 284
#note That was better than I expected. ONANIST was a mistake.
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEFHJNU 10L H.J +29 402
#note ENUF and HAJ are simming best, and I could have Q-stuck him, but his only play was worth 11, and I didn;t want to get J-stuck, so I played the J
>Edward_Zhuang: QRSS 10A Q. +11 295
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEFNU 14B CUNE. +20 422
#note Whoops. Missed ENUF. I knew he wouldn't challenge my plays, because I saw him let a ton of phoneys go in the previous game against his opponent, but I should have seen ENUF. I know that word.
>Edward_Zhuang: RSS 4K ..SS +6 301
#note GROWS is best
