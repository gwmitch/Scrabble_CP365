#note I was just so confused by this turn. I had no idea what to do. This is simming 7 points down from EAUX I2 and 3 points down from XU in both spots. Blech. 
>Judy_Newhouse: GIZ 3I ZIG +52 78
#note I deserve this. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEORTU J5 OUT +15 37
#note And for the second turn in a row, I am completely flummoxed. This time, quackle seems to think my play is okay, .3 points ahead of exchanging AOU. Okay. This game is really hard.

#note JUNTA is a great whiff.

#note She realizes she missed 15H and starts laughing after this. We all have our moments... This reminds me of a time I found NONJUR(OR) H1 for 69... and held a blank on my rack, which would have gone down as an S for 50 extra points.

#note I just don't think I can win. Quackle likes (R)UE but nothing has higher than 8% win. I think this game is basically over.
