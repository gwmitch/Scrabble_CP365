>Russell_Honeybun: EIJNOOP 8G JO +18 18
>Andrew_Fisher: AHLLOPV I6 HOLP +23 23
#note Nothing very appealing, and several different options have similar win% and equity.
>Russell_Honeybun: ?EGINOP J2 PIGEONs +86 104
>Andrew_Fisher: AEILRVV 3G REV.VAL +36 59
>Russell_Honeybun: CDEGQYZ H1 GE.Z +72 176
>Andrew_Fisher: AGINRSY 9A SYRINGA +73 132
#note After GEEZ I thought it worthwhile to open up the left side of the board to offer any reasonable prospect of winning. Better scores available from ARAYSING L1 and hooking REVIVAL.
>Russell_Honeybun: ACDDQSY L2 C.DDY +24 200
#note Russell has the highly obscure CADDYSS playable in column A. Otherwise DYADS looks reasonable
>Andrew_Fisher: ABCEORS E5 BACO.ERS +98 230
>Russell_Honeybun: AEMQRSU A2 MARQUES. +110 310
#note Damn you Russell!
>Andrew_Fisher: EEFILOT B1 FOE +22 252
#note Fishing for bingos, I overlook a nice slot-in EVIL K2 which nets 34
>Russell_Honeybun: AFINRTW F4 FAW +34 344
>Andrew_Fisher: ABEILTU 12E .UITABLE +72 324
>Russell_Honeybun: EIMNRTT 13I MEINT +35 379
#note TRIM at G2 is possibly a little better, but MEINT is effective
>Andrew_Fisher: AEIIRTU G3 .IA +23 347
>Russell_Honeybun: AEOORTX 8C OX. +37 416
>Andrew_Fisher: ?EILRTU N1 LUsTIER +79 426
#note Mine wins the sim, but I did consider alternatives in row 14 and was annoyed with Russell's comeback
>Russell_Honeybun: ADEKORT 14D TROAKED +83 499
>Andrew_Fisher: HINNTTW 15F WHIN +64 490
#note Despite the deficit, I have a large score available which actually offers slim winning chances
>Russell_Honeybun: ADEINSU O6 SED +16 515
#note Best would be plays in column K such as SAVIN or DIVAN, but pretty much anything delivers a win
>Andrew_Fisher: EINOTT 15A TOTE +18 508
#note My only hope is for a blunder, with VIN K3 (25) and IN B5 (19) available as outplays
>Russell_Honeybun: AINU M7 UNAI +10 525
>Russell_Honeybun:  (IN) +4 529
