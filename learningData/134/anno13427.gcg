>David_Klionsky: CDEKOO H4 COOKED +32 32
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?FHOTVW 6G H.WF +21 21
#note WHOOF sims best. I didn't know that without the H. AFter that, HOWF where I playedit is best
>David_Klionsky: LRRSTVY -LRRST +0 32
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?NORTTV 8G V.RT +7 28
#note TEVATRON is the only bingo here. After that, VENt and VERT sim best. Also OUTCOOKED for 45 showed up. I didn't ever remotely look at tht spot
>David_Klionsky: BEL F7 BEL +13 45
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?LNNOTZ 5F NO. +8 36
#note I sort of suck at these types of plays. I saw ZONAL for 43, but I wasn't sure whether to use the blank or not in this case. ZONAL does sim best, followed by NOT and then CONN and the OUTCOOKED. NOO is way down. I'm not really sure about the cutoffs in this type of case abou using he blank.
>David_Klionsky: HNRU 4H .HURN +20 65
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?CLNTU 10D CULT +16 52
#note Can't make out my last tile here. CULT is best though
>David_Klionsky: ITY D10 .ITY +18 83
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADNORZ 11C Z.N +28 80
#note Completely missed AZO C13 here, which is simming best, followedby DOZY and then ZIN. 
>David_Klionsky: EQU 13A QUE. +32 115
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADEOOR J8 .OO +5 85
#note Didn't know TOREADOR or WANDEROO, the two best plays here. Also did not think of simply hooking BELL to make BELLE, even though I knew that word.  TOO is simming 4th among the nonbinges, with the top being A(ZIN)E. However,most f these plays left two O's, but I suppose that holding DOOR? is at least 15 points better than holding ADER?. I also have to stop fishing.
>David_Klionsky: IY F3 YI. +6 121
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADDERR 2C DREADeR +69 154
#note DARNEDER is the only playable bingo here. He held this play, but decided to let it go because he had his own bingo
>David_Klionsky: ?AEGIIR L1 GAI.lIER +61 182
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEIOPPV 1G APO +29 183
#note Whoops. Missed POP, which is first. APO is right after it.
>David_Klionsky: ILT 1L .ILT +15 197
>Amalan_Iyengar: EIIIPTV D1 P.IVET +28 211
#note This sims best. I couldn't play off the R's, and basically I needed to score, not fish for a bingo

>David_Klionsky: ELX M7 LEX +24 221
>Amalan_Iyengar: ABEGGII N8 BIG +24 235
#note At first, I was going to play BIGGIE, but then I realized the implications of him bingoing with BIGGIES or REBS, so I decided to go with BIG. BIGGIE is simming best, probably because there are 4 s's left, and if I get rid of 6 tiles, I am probably likely to draw one of the 4 unseen S's. BIG is a bit down, after GIBE and GIGA and BAGGIE.
>David_Klionsky: DEORST O3 DOTERS +42 263
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEEFGN -AAEEFNG +0 235
#note Wow. I overdrew again, and he picked the S again. I need to be more careful. I forgot what I exchanged here
>David_Klionsky: AU A13 .UA +36 299
>Amalan_Iyengar: EF N5 EF +28 263
>David_Klionsky: AJO 6B JO.A +27 326
>Amalan_Iyengar: AMN C5 M.AN +11 274
#note So I didn't write down my rack here, but I figured that if there were 3 S's left, I would probably draw one of them, and I had to keep the board open, so I didn't touch the 11 lane. Now I realize that was a bad idea. I could have played ON/NAM or something and open up the board a lot
>David_Klionsky: GIW 8A WI.G +30 356
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEIMNS 15A .NAEMIAS +83 357
#note Both bingoes win, and I was less sure about TOOM than I was about ANAEMIAS, so I played ANAEMIAS. Phew. I finished 4-1, and got 15 rating, and won the tournament.
