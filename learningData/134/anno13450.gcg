#note getting closer! I didn't want to play JOEY blocking all of my nice bingo lines, although I now have a good lane on column B and row 15 as well. I thought about GLOOMY holding the J as well. probably JOEY is better.

#note I liked making this play to allow me to open this side of the board next turn. quackle likes GHOULIE, which I saw but passed up so I wouldn't mess with that side of the board. I guess I'm not actually losing by that much, but after XP's next play I'll be down 40 some with very few bingo lanes to hit.

>JD: ADNOUVX -V +0 275
#note well, I'm in deep trouble now. the only way I could see to come back was to fish for RONDEAUX, and the V plays nowhere. so exchange 1. However the better move here is probably DAVIT at E5 setting up a 50-point X play. XP would almost certainly see it, but even RONDEAUX probably wouldn't win anyway and this at least gives me a chance. at this point I already had a tie so I figured spread didn't matter.

#note Here my best play is the highly counterintuitive ON at 3G which blocks PIC and lets me play AX/AZOIC next time. but my will to live had already been crushed by now.

#note well I actually think I played this one ok until I started screwing around at the end. well done xp. this was actually my only 300 game of the tournament
