>David_Eldar: AEFGORT 8D FAGOTER +80 80
>Andrew_Fisher: DHINOOR 7I HOOD +23 23
#note HOD or DOH score a few more points, and I suppose are better despite killing all those floaters
>David_Eldar: ACINNRW 9C RAWIN +26 106
#note Playing short probably also preferable here, e.g. WIN or NAW at 9G
>Andrew_Fisher: EIIKNRZ J6 Z..I +33 56
#note I make a terrible play here, creating an opening for sevens but overlooking the scoring power of ZERK 10B
>David_Eldar: BCDEENY M3 BENDY +46 152
#note Sensible choice, noting as an aside that DEBYE 10D scores a couple more
>Andrew_Fisher: AEGIKNR E6 RE..AKING +84 140
>David_Eldar: CELORRT 10H COLTER +26 178
#note Tough position, and David expended a few brain cells. The sim suggests LOR 10J instead, but only just.
>Andrew_Fisher: EIJLPSU 13C PU.JI +30 170
#note Maybe GJU 14E? Not sure that EILPS is that strong here
>David_Eldar: AACENOR 14B CON.A +37 215
>Andrew_Fisher: ?AELMPS 15F PELhAMS +95 265
#note I didn't mind leaving the hotspot at 14J, but possibly PALMERS or MAPLESS are slightly better, minimising overlap scores
>David_Eldar: AENRTUY 14J YU +30 245
#note David refuses the seductive 51-point play YEARN, needing to bingo
>Andrew_Fisher: ADEGHQU L1 QUAD +58 323
>David_Eldar: AEENRTV 12G AVENTRE +80 325
>Andrew_Fisher: ABEFGHR 10B REH.B +41 364
>David_Eldar: DEIOTUW 1K E.UID +45 370
#note This is the last U but you might as well spend it.
>Andrew_Fisher: AEFGISS 8M SIF +30 394
#note Quackle likes FIG K3
>David_Eldar: ILOOSTW K5 WO.S +37 407
#note WITLOOFS not being available, Quackle still prefers retaining the S (e.g. WOO K3)
>Andrew_Fisher: AEGIOSV 12B VAG. +29 423
#note Eight in the bag, and a pivotal moment. With David disposing of an S, perhaps he had retained the blank, and I was wary of creating too many floaters - but simulation likes VOGIE F2. Mine scores well but leaves too many vowels.
>David_Eldar: ILLOTTX 6D T.ILL +7 414
#note A poor pickup to ILOT, with the high-scoring XI 13M offering an unworkable leave. Cognisant of the missing blank Quackle likes O-column blockers such as LOT or LIT 13M, but TROLL 6D also fares reasonably well because of the XI retention. TRILL doesn't perform in comparison, but still offers a shot at OXTAIL.
>Andrew_Fisher: AEEINOS 11K EA +13 436
#note I had ticked off the unseen tiles but foolishly overlooked the M, thinking the bag was empty and David held ?EIOTTX. With time running out my intention was to block EXIT 13L and set up EOSIN if David settled on XI, but I'm not sure what I would have done in response to OXTAIL H1. The risk-averse Quackle CP proposes AE at 13M.
>David_Eldar: EIMOTTX 6M .EX +13 427
#note Amazingly, the blank was the last tile in the bag, David having successfully avoided it. He was also down on time, but identified that my OLEFINS would beat any move on his part, therefore seeking to block it with a cunning outplay up his sleeve. MOTIF O4 or FIX O8 would be slightly better, but still lose the game.
>Andrew_Fisher: ?EINOS H1 ENtOI. +18 454
#note With about ten seconds left I hastily dumped a play at H1. INSIDE/AVENTRED N8 nets ten extra points, but I'm glad I didn't have to find it.
>David_Eldar: IMOTT D1 TOMTI. +18 445
>David_Eldar:  (S) +2 447
