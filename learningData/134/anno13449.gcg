#note neither HOWITZER nor TRIAZOLE seemed worth playing
>Scott_Garner: AJ 6H JA. +13 94
#note this is a smart play. he looks like he has a big leave, and this keeps me from blocking MIXUPS.
>JD: ?DEORTT 12E DOTTeRE. +59 131
#note this was a huge swing, I just completely chickened out of DOTTERS. as it turns out he bingoes anyway, but this ends up being a 47 point swing against me. ouch.

#note I wanted a new lane open on the board. EMAIL at 13E is an option too.
>Scott_Garner: HW 4K WH. +18 204
#note scott had been playing really slow so I started an all-out speed rush starting on this turn.

#note after a couple of easy turns in a row it really felt like I was going to run away with it. unfortunately this was a huge mistake since BOULE is available. I don't usually fast-play opponents, but there has to be value in forcing the tempo against your opponent that makes it ok to make small mistakes - but this is a pretty big one.

#note I would love to reach further into the bag and give myself a better shot at the blank. quackle suggests CURBED at D3 or YUCH at L1 - I think my favorite now might be YUCH, which might give me a second chance at fishing, gives me an extra shot at the blank and leaves the C and D open.
