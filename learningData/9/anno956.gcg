#note WOOL at 10b is best

#note took too long on this play, wasting valuable time

#note Ken traded all 7 with his turn

>Steve: AEEGRSU 7H .EU +14 100
#note A gamble that he didn't just pick up the X
>Dutch: ?AFOTTU -  +0 95
#note Ken passes back two tiles
>Steve: AEGHRST K8 GATHERS +84 184
#note Feeling pretty confident, as I'm up 80+ on a closed board
>Dutch: I 11K .I +5 100
#note Ken realizes he needs to open the board, but I'm guessing he sacrificed too many points in doing so with this play.
>Steve: EEINNOR M8 NINE +11 195
#note Making it as difficult as I can for him to bingo.
>Dutch: AFIN C12 NAIF +26 126
>Steve: EKOPRVW B11 WORK +43 238
#note This play puts me up 112 points, and I'm now hoping to outrun him, even if he does bingo.
>Dutch: ?EFLSTT N3 FETTLeS +64 190
>Steve: DEIPUVV L3 UPDIVE +31 269
#note This is a pretty play that dumps tiles. I played it quickly, unfortunately. VIED at 01 scores more points and doesn't set up a rather easy double-double line.
>Dutch: IX O4 XI +36 226
#note At least my last play blocked an easy 50 point X play.
>Steve: AEGILOV 5F GLAIVE. +24 293
#note More precious time clicks off the clock as I play very deliberately here. Sacrifice five points to take out the double-double line and burn tiles with the second blank still unseen.
>Dutch: DNO E7 NOD +11 237
>Steve: EEOORUY D5 YOU +8 301
#note Not anything close to what I was hoping for on the pick. It was either this or EURO down the A column. This makes it harder for him to get down a bingo. . . or so I thought.
>Dutch: AADEMNT O9 MANDATE +91 328
#note Dinner is served.
>Steve: ABEEIOR N12 OBIA +25 326
#note I decide to empty the bag, just in case he didn't pick up the last blank. Championship Player prefers OBE in the same spot.
>Dutch: BCO C3 COB +21 349
#note Ken gave himself 25 points for this play, and I didn't catch it - probably due to time trouble.
>Steve: AEEENRS H1 AREN. +18 344
>Dutch: ?EEL 2H .EEL +6 355
>Steve: EES D10 ....S +17 361
#note Surprisingly, Ken doesn't go out. This leaves me a winning play, but I don't see it. Do you?
