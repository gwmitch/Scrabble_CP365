#note the effects of analyzing my games is slowly creeping into my game.  normally, i would play POW somewhere but in situations like this, Quackle would always prefer playing OW.  so that's what i did here.  and quackle agrees.  yes, the logic is weak here:  playing more like quackle does not necessarily imply playing better.  but considering the leave of LIES versus PLIES is something i would not have given serious thought without my time with quackle.

#note missed:  14J WELSH 49.  I took a long time this turn deciding if this word was good.  I know WELCH and WELCHER but couldn't remember WELSH.  playing WHELPED is also better than my play.
