>Carl: BEIOSUW -BIOUW +0 0
#note I'm often a fan of the opening exchange, but in this case I'd be happy to take the 16 points for BOW.
>Bing: ?AENTUV 8D VAUNTiE +76 76
>Carl: AELLNSZ I7 Z.LL +23 23
>Bing: BFIILRU E3 FIBUL. +22 98
#note Essentially a tossup between FIBULA and FIBULAR.
>Carl: AENORSS 11F REASONS +77 100
#note The 11C placement is slightly more defensive, though not without risk.
>Bing: EEIKORT E11 TOKE +32 130
#note Lots of options: TIKE is certainly safer than TOKE or TOKER, but I should have looked beyond the TREASONS hook. KETO F2 opens nothing and is clearly the best choice.
>Carl: ADDEIMO 15A AIMED +37 137
#note Or MEDIAD for the extra 6 points.
>Bing: EEHIORY 13C HO.EY +38 168
>Carl: ADOORTX 14D D.X +56 193
>Bing: AEIORRV L8 VER.O +24 192
#note Didn't think I could get away with OVERFAIR*. 
>Carl: AGIOORT G1 ROGATIO. +62 255
>Bing: AACGIRT 8L .AGI +24 216
#note The deficit was getting serious and I wanted to keep the board open for a comeback bingo. This did not work out very well.

#note Alas, I had some hope of getting TRACTION down, but without that my chances were pretty much nil.
