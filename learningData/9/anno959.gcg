>Edward_S._De_Guzman: IIMNOOT 8G NOMOI +14 14
#note best:  8D MOTION 22; i don't think i seriously considered this play.  i don't like the possible front hooks.
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: DLOUW 7J WOULD +17 17
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: DEINPTU 9H DUP +23 37
#note best:  9I UP 18; in a previous game I kept PILES instead of ILES and quackle agreed.  i guess it's the same case here.  
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: CEI 10F ICE +11 28
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: EEEINRT M3 TREE.INE +68 105
#note best:  E7 TEENIER 70.  i remember looking at another div1 game going on next to me and seeing SEROCINE*.  i thought, "what are these guys smoking?  to (a) play such a high-prob phony and (b) accept it?".  and i play this gem.  TREELINE* looked funny but i talked myself into playing it.  I actually didn't see the 7.  I saw the three Es on my rack and thought there was little chance of anything there.  again, maybe i should learn anamonics.  ENTIRE + E ......
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: AX N9 AX +52 80
#note maybe this was why he let it stay on the board?

#note best:  H1 FRIGHT 45.  i was looking for a 5 ending in H to play there.  didn't think of the -HT ending in a 6.

>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AGTTUVW L10 VAW +31 325
#note best:  H1 WAUGHT 45.  I don't know this word but I do know WAUGH and TAUGHT which were also better plays than mine.
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: BMO K11 MOB +27 304
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: ?AGLTTU O10 TUG +20 345
#note best:  H1 TAUGHT 36.  it is probably a good idea to open more lines for myself but this is too many letters to drop, IMO.

#note i really should just claim that due to "poor annotation" I can't reconstruct the endgame.  but i honestly will hide nothing from these games.  first, it was bad that I didn't play GITS (not 100% sure of it).  so i spent a lot of time looking for a place for GIST or any other outplay.  didn't find it and got frustrated.  i'm also not as focused because i have the game won.  so i played a phony 2 as my *main* word.  i swear i was possessed.  maybe sam was sending me telepathic messages to play SOWPODS.  i put the tiles down, announced the score, hit the clock without any hesitation.  then i woke up when he said HOLD.  lame.  
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: EEEN 4F NEE +10 429
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: GIST 11K ..S +14 523
#note i am pretty much stumbling my away across the finish line.  now i'm even more chicken to play GITS. so i play another phony by hooking an S on TREELINE*.  double lame.  and he lets it go, hehe.
>I_Knit_Mahatmas: E 7E ..E +9 438
#note ugh.  to add salt to the wound, another div1 player was watching and saw this endgame played out.  it was a topic of conversation at dinner afterwards.  i don't think he knew about TREELINE*  so in the retelling, I'm the only one who is the chump.  wonderful.
