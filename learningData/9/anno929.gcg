#note A long sim shows XI slightly ahead, but I don't think keeping the M is quite worth 6 points. Besides, I thought I should block DISTELFINK.

#note ZIG (14F) looks better, but I guess the IG is not terrible with an N to play through.
>Bing: ?EEHIOO 15M OOH +25 154
#note It's either this or OORIE. 
>Jerry: DEEGIPT E4 DE. +12 123
#note This was a very mysterious play. Maybe I'm missing something, but I really don't see the merit of clinging to the GP combination.

#note Should be smooth sailing after this lucky draw.

#note A slight error. WAIF (D2) helps to kill the upper left, making it more difficult for Jerry to mount a comeback.
>Jerry: EEJLORT D1 JOLE +44 259
#note This is just the kind of play that WAIF would guard against.
>Bing: ADDFINS 12C FID +18 356
#note I didn't have a very good way to block, but I probably should have played FIND (C4).

#note This was a very nice fit that took me by surprise.
>Bing: INRTU 2C ..N +5 426
#note Horrible blunder. Somehow, I thought I had a W-stick. There were lots of ways to win, the best being TUTOR (2A).
