#note PUNCTATOR#! Eh, back to the game at hand...took me a while to go through all the different mediocre plays available here. Quack likes this one too.
>Scott: ILL 6G .ILL +7 32
>Geoff: EINRRTT 5D R.T +3 49
#note Thought about REPRINT (better by 3 than what I did) but couldn't convince myself to break up the rack for 20, even if the board wasn't looking friendly. And I figured PUNCHIER (about as good as REPRINT) would be there next turn...exchanging RT does as well as playing it for 3 points. Might have something to do with blocking PRE- bingos.

>Scott: AEILNST 4E .ANTILES +74 122
>Geoff: IJMNRST 5K MINT +22 101
#note With two esses already out and no good J plays or S spots, I figured it was a decent shot to set up the hook. Barely finishes ahead of JET K3. 
>Scott: EFU F10 FEU +29 151
>Geoff: DJMNRSV -DJMNV +0 101
#note Let's try that again...the duck says keep DRS, though it's super close. There are a ton of A's, E's and O's out, true. I hadn't started tracking tiles yet; I usually do that about halfway into the game. It cuts down on my tracking errors significantly, but if I don't take enough time to notice an unusual first-half distribution I might miss it.
>Scott: ABO 6L BOA +18 169
#note I'm thinking he has an R or T and/or wants to weaken the hook...
>Geoff: AEEEORS 7M OE +10 111
#note There the vowels are...cat and mouse game here. I played OE to set my S up again and maybe mess with what Scott might do on the O column himself...many other OE fishes do about equally well in sim.
>Scott: ABE H1 ABE. +18 187
>Geoff: AEEORSW J9 OWE +16 127
#note Didn't think of BEWARES to score 40 and chase blanks. Now that I see it, I like it. Here I was too focused on grooming the current rack, I think.
>Scott: ?EIKLST O7 SKIlLET +86 273
>Geoff: ACEORSW O1 CROWS +49 176
#note CROWEAS#...okay, CROWS. Hmm, Q wants me to keep fishing, in addition to reminding me that I have about a 1 percent chance of winning now. Maybe the pool is bad enough (FHJQVVXYY) that Q thinks I can't hope to draw bingos out of it after CROWS? 
>Scott: ?AAGNOV 2D VAGA.ONd +69 342
#note Nicely done...
>Geoff: ADEGHIR 13A HAGRIDE +84 260
>Scott: EPRX H12 PREX +61 403
#note I had to hope to get a play like this, but Scott got it instead.
>Geoff: MNNQRYY -NQYY +0 260
#note Quackle prefers just keeping MR. I have nothing to add here.
>Scott: GO A13 .OG +21 424
>Geoff: AADEMNR N2 AM +16 276
>Scott: FO K10 OF +25 449
>Geoff: ADENQRV 9N Q. +11 287
#note Suppose I could have blocked the B column instead, since he probably has JAY there...though wait, I think he can probably Q stick me if I do that.
>Scott: EIJNUYY B12 Y.Y +28 477
>Geoff: ADEENRV 14G N.RVE +18 305
#note Mistake - didn't ensure another out with ADE. Scott didn't block the D column out play, but if he did that would have increased the spread even more. Oh well, lunchtime.
