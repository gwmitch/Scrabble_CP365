#note Kills the fabs lane for bingoes

#note So it looks like she has the blank and the A and is fishing for a bing. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEORRS 14J .ARER +16 345
#note The rationale is this: She won't bingo and I'll have an outplay at M1 or N10 with any consonant I pull out of the bag, she can't outrun me and I'll win. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?FLNRST 12I N..uS +23 352
#note But then I pull the A. Whaaaaa-? Now I don't have any points or any outs. Thankfully, she's low on time and messes this up.

>Terry_Kang_Rau: FLRT J4 F..T +15 367
>Matt_Canik: OS M3 OS +13 370
#note Didn't make a mistake this game, I think yarer was a solid play as I had to assume the A was on her rack, and yarer won under those circumstances. I still eked it out regardless, but against a faster or stronger player I probably wouldn't have. Nonetheless, a game where I get thoroughly bagged and win.
