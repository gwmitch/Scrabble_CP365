>Jason: AEEOPSU 8G EAU +6 6
>Todd: EJW 7E JEW +26 26
>Jason: EEEOPRS 6F PEE +27 33
#note Didn't spend much time on this at all.  Seemed like some sort of easy equity move and if there was a tricky play didn't bother to find it.
>Todd: GIP 9I PIG +16 42
>Jason: EINOORS L6 EROSION +73 106
#note Did actually bother to count up both placements.  Didn't see REJOINS here yet.  Later in the game I saw the idea, but spent time thinking about whether REJOINT was good or not.
>Todd: BEN 11K B.NE +12 54
>Jason: BEFORST 10I OF +31 137
#note Spent a lot of time thinking about BEFRET and whether it was good.  Didn't think of BEREFT (probably would have played it before I got to thinking about OF).  Thought about FOBS and FORBS but decided they spent the S too cheap.  Saw OF and played almost instantly.
>Todd: IIIII -IIIII +0 54
>Jason: BDEIRST N7 BIST.RED +76 213
#note Found BESTRIDE and BISTERED reasonably quickly.  Found BESTRID, couldn't remember if it was good.  Thought about DIBSTER* and rejected, REDBITS* (figured out REDBAITS a bit later), didn't remember BISTRED at all.  Funny to be very confident on the 8s and reject BESTRID which hopped into mind.  Definitely rejected it though.
>Todd: IS O7 IS +16 70
>Jason: EHIMOQR O13 HEM +32 245
#note Decided to play this (also saw and rejected NOH) and thought it was a fairly awful move, just took a bunch of points, was unhappy to be blocking YExxx or DExxx plays that I thought I would see but he wouldn't, but eh.
>Todd: ?ADILST 13F DeTAILS +66 136
#note Honestly was only about 80% that this was good.
>Jason: INOOQRR H11 RO.OR +18 263
#note Sole thinking here was "hey there are 7 As, maybe I'll get to play QAID."  No more planning than that and "get rid of RROO for 18 with a Q strategy iff I have an A."
>Todd: V O6 V.. +6 142
#note Was only 80% VIS was good.

>Jason: AEEINQY F10 QAI. +34 297
#note Yay, I drew the A.  The "plan" came to fruition.
>Todd: AFIL I3 FAIL +17 159
>Jason: DEENNYZ J2 ZED +41 338
#note Saw EYEN, was under the misapprehension these were the last 2 Es on my rack, landed on ZED and just played it since he seemed sort of to be fishing sort of and bingo lines and 41 points.

One thought I had had was on the DEENNYZ rack that if he played an M word at 5h I could ENZYME for 72.  Spent more time counting ENZYME than thinking up a good play.
>Todd: ?CEGINW 15D CoWE.ING +66 225
>Jason: AENNTTY 5B YENTA +21 359
#note Still thinking this was last E, burned it opening lines, feeling like this was a really bad play.  Said to him that I wouldn't play it in a tourney but I bet I might have.  Didn't see k1 NAY; would have played that had I seen it.
>Todd: UX 6C XU +20 245
>Jason: HLNOORT 8A ORTHO +45 404
#note Played it really fast because  I was at least 50% sure I was phonying.  Didn't remember THORO at all, though it looks familiar now that Quack mentions it.    Had been looking at the O spot for a while at least, but several other times was fortunate not to have a better play while I wasn't looking (like from H1, for example.)  
>Todd: CIT B2 CIT. +18 263
>Jason: AAGLNNU D8 .ANGUL +20 424
#note Had found ALGA 4b and was mildly disappointed to have it blocked.  Was confident of HANGUL because of all the Starcraft 2 Korean scene (told him not to challenge) plus I remembered it on a dead 6 list.  Didn't think long at all about this play, didn't really look at pool much, no idea how bad it is (statically I guess it looks fine, generated after writing this).  Put almost no thought into it, so I guess it's lucky it was OK.
>Todd: ADELMRY K1 YAM +27 290
>Jason: ADELNOT 2B .ANT +6 430
#note Fixed my tracking, saw TALONED, found one in DELATION and then realized it wouldn't fit, checked the O and the R, saw he had KIVA, blocked KIVA and left YODLE.  Found TAIN and ANTI and couldn't remember if there were more 4s.  That was about it that I saw in the endgame, total a few minutes.   I have no idea what the right move was.
>Todd: AKRUV 1C KA +16 306

>Jason:  (RUV) +12 472
