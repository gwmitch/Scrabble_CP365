>Brian_Bowman: AY H7 YA +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: DIORTVY 9E TIVY +23 23
#note Q docks me almost 5 points for this, saying that I should play IVY 9F.  Given that he opened short, I was more concerned about his hooking IVY with a front T down the 2x2 than I was about making it easier for him to play at 8A.
>Brian_Bowman: AU E9 .AU +6 16
>Jim_Burlant: DOOPRVW F7 VO.D +19 42
#note Took forever to find this and realized right after I hit the clock that I should have played the other O.   Q says I should have just played VOW I6 and docks me 4 points for this, and this sims 2-1/2 points down on OVOID.  Like I said - no argument that OVOID, which I didn't see until after I hit the clock - is better.  But  with Brian obviously fishing, I'm not going to open up easy front hooks in the 2x2 lanes, which ruled out VOW.
>Brian_Bowman: ALM I6 LAM +16 32
>Jim_Burlant: AJOPRUW 6E JOW +26 68
#note Weak - too busy looking to atone for my previous mistake rather than looking at the board.  J8 PUJA scores 36 and is much much better.  
>Brian_Bowman: ?DEENRS 12C RESENDs +72 104
>Jim_Burlant: AAAEPRU 11H AURAE +14 82
#note The question - do you hang the E for him to play through or do you give him the all-too-easy back hook by only playing AURA?  Q likes C10 AURA, which is insane - play for 8 and give back 30 given my deficit?  No thanks.  Q doesn't particularly like this play but it was the only thing I saw that kept a balanced combo that wasn't completely unsafe.  Of the options I do have, C8 PARURA looks likt the best of a mediocre lot.
>Brian_Bowman: ABDEFIT L5 TABEFI.D +80 184
>Jim_Burlant: AACIOOP C9 APO.IA +18 100
#note If you're in this position and he's put down TABEFIED#, how sure about this word do I have to be to challenge?  I held  and my gut had no inclincation one way or another as to whether this was good.   My thinking was that my impending play of APORIA for 18 would bring me back within a bingo (admittedly a big bingo).  But there were still SSSXZ? still unseen, anything could still happen and if I let it go, I'm back in the game with a good draw.  If I challenge and lose the turn, the game is over because now I'm down over 100 and still sitting on this crappy rack.   As for this play - Q prefers C8 PICARO or 5I COATI for 22, and C8 PICARO for 22, docking me 5 points.  This worked out, however.
>Brian_Bowman: EGILNOS 14B G.SOLINE +72 256
#note Appropriate, because my decision to let TABEFIED# go has just thrown gasoline on the fire!  Ouch!  Brian is winning 99%.  But just like the man said in "Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"  "I'm not dead yet."
>Jim_Burlant: CEHNORT 15I NOTCHER +97 197
#note 15G placement scores 99, but I need the extra volatility; if I play at 15G, I won't have any easy 7's available if I don't have an S; now I have 2 extra lines.
>Brian_Bowman: IPZ K4 ZIP +36 292
>Jim_Burlant: EIKNNOR B3 EINKORN +73 270
#note Back from 1% winning chances to 20 in just 2 turns.
>Brian_Bowman: ORTT A1 TORT +20 312
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEIIN 8K B.EDI +24 294
#note Trading points looking for the bingo, and Quackle agrees with this choice...almost.  I did pass up A7 BEAD becase I thought the IIN leave was a recipe for losing.  Q prefers C1 BIDE by roughly 2-1/2 ponts, with this as the silver medalist.
>Brian_Bowman: EFQU 10K F.QUE +24 336
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINWX C6 AX +40 334
#note Scored as 56; corrected soon thereafter.  Say what?  The best play is of course C1 WAX.  Right as I was about to put  down WAX, I saw the blue premium space and put down the 56-point X bomb.  Except that we were playing on a non-standard board with green triple-letters and blue double-letters.  I realized this while he was pondering his next move, and we corrected the score accordingly.  Small consolation:  given his next rack, it didn't exactly matter.
>Brian_Bowman: ?ELLRST N1 STRoLLE. +70 406
>Jim_Burlant: GIW C1 WIG +22 356
#note Scores 30 at J5.
>Brian_Bowman: HMU 1L MU.H +36 442
#note Annotation ends here nothing of note except he drew the remaining S and steamrolled me even more in the end game.  Final score 474 - 376.
