#note Uh...so I think I have it in the bag, and I'm looking to score a little and set up a place for QI. I do so, and I pick the last tile in the bag, and then I see the board - oh #@$! no, PREDRAF(T), I have CQX staring at me - I could lose! I did the math and was relieved to see I'd win 514-510 (!) even if PREDRAFT goes down. Still, whoa...

#note Weird: Quackle's Win% column thinks PREDRAFT wins, but it doesn't.
