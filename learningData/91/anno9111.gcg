#note Saw TUNNED but wasn't sure, though I doubt it would have been challenged. Exchanging sims about as well.
>Yvonne: RY J9 .RY +8 27
>Geoff: DELLNRT 11I D.NEL +18 38
#note Took a long time on this turn. I didn't like this play, but I hated everything else I came up with. Maybe TRENDY for better board control. (They sim about equally well.)
>Yvonne: EJR L10 J.ER +22 49
>Geoff: GLORRTV -GLORV +0 38
#note Some plays sim better, M8 TROLL or K6 GROT best (6 points better than x5). Probably a little too focused on ditching the V but not junking up the board with it. Also, she's not running away with anything yet...TROLL, yeah. 
>Yvonne: DEGINOS 14F DINGOES +77 126
>Geoff: INOPRTV 13C PIVOT +28 66
#note Q prefers VINO H12 here by a good amount, which surprises me a little. PIVOT is less defensive and scores 5 fewer points. Wouldn't have figured NPRT to fare as well as it seems to here. (Yes, I was probably sick of the consonant glut too, but that shouldn't affect the decision and I don't really think it did here.)
>Yvonne: ABOT 15D BOAT +16 142
>Geoff: CEIINRV 7D VICE +16 82
#note Gah, missed ICE(BOAT). Passed up VINIC/MYC thinking it would shut the board down too much. G6 IC(H) is kind of cute if you're gonna miss ICEBOAT. 
>Yvonne: CHI 10F HIC +26 168
>Geoff: INORRTU 11D RUIN +15 97
#note Didn't consider TURION in the same spot. Four more points, chases the blanks - yeah, does seem better. 
>Yvonne: PX J13 P.X +12 180
>Geoff: DEERTUW 12B DUE +18 115
#note Figure opp has an S or blank by now, esp. after POX, so JEW's out. I'd play DUE again.
>Yvonne: ?EGNSTW E2 SWEaT.NG +72 252
>Geoff: AEIIRTW 2C WI.TERIA +65 180
>Yvonne: AFOOT 1F AFOOT +41 293
>Geoff: EFLQRRZ D1 Q. +21 201
#note Q thinks FERREL keeping QZ is a viable option. At this score, I'm not seeing it. QI edges it out in the sim.
>Yvonne: LO 3B LO +14 307
>Geoff: AEFLRRZ 3G ZA +49 250
#note Alive, sort of.
>Yvonne: AEGINOU 4C GA. +15 322
>Geoff: EFILLRR 6G FRILLER +71 321
#note Was maybe 80% sure of this bingo, but no choice at this point. It's good.
>Yvonne: ?AIKNSS L1 SNAKI.St +74 396
#note Oh well.
