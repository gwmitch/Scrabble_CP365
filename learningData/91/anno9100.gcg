#note AVOID sims a little better. Wish I had gone for it.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEEJY D8 .EEJAY +38 38
>Sam: EINOORT E11 ONO +31 57
#note JO 11D sims best by about three points. That seems a little crazy, and the sim probably has Kate opening things up more than she will in actuality. I still like ONO, though maybe JO is better.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EGT F10 GET +21 59
>Sam: EEGIORT F6 GO. +8 65
#note DOGIE is simming slightly better.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEIOTX H5 OXI.ATE +15 74
>Sam: EEILMRT I3 REMIT +25 90
#note EMIT sims a little better. I guess the hook will probably benefit me, especially since OXIDATED is already open.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DDEIK 12H DIKED +45 119
>Sam: BELORUU 11K BOULE +25 115
#note DIdn't see TUBULE, which sacrifices eleven points but is probably the play.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: INWZ O7 WINZ. +51 170
>Sam: ACDEHRU 13L DUH +19 134
#note Quackle's favorite play by win percentage is the pretty absurd UN 9N. EUCHRED 4I is a good alternative that I didn't see, though.

>Sam: ABCEORU N13 .UB +16 150
#note Wasn't happy with this play when I made it but I was getting low on time. Pretty bad. ARBOUR 3H seems better as it uses more tiles to try and draw blanks.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: LNY I11 L.NY +10 191
>Sam: ACEIOOR 15J CARI.E +33 183
#note Chose this over CARBO for the extra points and turnover.

>Sam: ??ACPSV L4 CAP +24 293
#note Not sure what was right here. I didn't want to play VAC at 4L because I knew she had the S. I thought about PAVAN 3C for a while, perhaps I should have gone with that. At this point I didn't see the huge risk that TRANQ posed.

#note Now I'm in deep trouble. Kate threatens TRANQS 2B for 36 points. Championship Player suggests that my play of RANT wins 75% of endgames. However it only wins if the A or I are in the bag, as she has wins of various difficulty in all the other situations. I don't think there were any wins with the U in the bag.
