#note Oops: 9H H(A)IRLINE 67.  I didn't look nearly long enough.
>Darrell_Day: CEOTVY K9 COVET.Y +30 100
#note Still have trouble holding higher-rated players when things seem fishy.  Meh.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEOOQZ B10 ZOEAE +107 321
#note Hehe.  (If you know Darrell you can imagine his reaction.)
>Darrell_Day: ADEILRU L2 UREDIAL +73 259
#note And of course he HAD the reaction before pulling his bango.
>Ryan_Fischer: DMOQRTW 2K Q.OD +28 349
#note N8 DOW 35 is out of the question!  A12 TROW is a little more reasonable.  I figured I'd just best lose the Q and hope for some vowels.
>Darrell_Day: CEINORT 4H NEOT.RIC +64 323
#note Bongo!  And that's 4 in 6 turns!
>Ryan_Fischer: MMRRTVW J3 W.RM +15 364
#note Well, none of my options are great.  I figured W(O)RM made me more flexible than MM so I took that and set to hope again.  Another option is exchanging keeping RT, and I might should have.  There's that backdoor option though of me hitting B2 for major points with that M in tow.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABMRTV --  -43 364
#note I had this for 47 and opted to take this spot out.  I guess Shriner* is proper?

>Darrell_Day: AAE 3I A.A.E +43 422
#note That's pretty impressive!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BDPTVX N8 BoX +59 470
#note Best, at 54% win.  All comes down to what I draw.
>Darrell_Day: FGILNOS O4 .OIFS +48 470
#note He was thinking of fishing for LONGIES in 2 places (forget where or what his rack was).  If he played the fish and what came after perfectly he could have eked out a win.
>Ryan_Fischer: DIKPSTV O12 KIST +49 519
#note I played KIST instead of KIDS to save the D for OWED in case he tries to slow-play me for a V-stick.
