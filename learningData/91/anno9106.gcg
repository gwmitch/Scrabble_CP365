#note Interesting start. If I were going first, I would have played SPANK. I like my play, but didn't consider KNAP enough. Quackle likes KNAPS/SPANK best, then KNAP, then keep PANGS?, then mine. And that doesn't really change when you give Zev SATIRE.

#note I spent forever trying to figure out what to trade. Quackle actually likes TOLE and other plays at 10A over an exchange, but I didn't like crippling my rack when he's set up the S hook.

#note Whee! I was so pleased with myself but didn't spot MOXIE N10, a cool play that sims just a hair back.
>zev: BIILTUV B1 VI.L +14 368
#note Zev's actual rack. The only play that gives him a real chance here is VOLTI, which blocks both QOPH and JAG. TUX C2 to stick me with the Q has a tiny winning percentage.
>monkey: HJLPQRY B7 J.. +11 413
#note My logic was flawed here. I played the J first because there's only one spot for it whereas he can't touch both Is, but should have realized that I want my two turns to be QI and HYP L11. Did not see LYMPH at all.
