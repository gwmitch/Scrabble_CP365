>Ken: IIIIIII -IIII +0 22
>Geoff: HLPRSST F7 T..HS +16 35
#note Ooh, SHT(ET)L! Didn't think of it. I wavered between TETH and TETHS. Quackle much prefers TETH to TETHS despite the five-consonant leave.
>Ken: AQ 7D QA. +15 37
>Geoff: ELLNPRS -LLN +0 35
#note Trade LLP? Just LL? Didn't really consider playing through, though SNELL or SPELL is kind of cute. SNELL is about 2 ahead of ex LLN in a short sim.

>Geoff: AEGOPRS 6M GO +15 87
#note I did consider PARGO somewhat, but GO looks obviously right now.

>Geoff: ?ADEPRS K7 .DAPtERS +70 157
#note Didn't see PARKADES/SPARKLED. Look everywhere! SPARKLED is best.

#note Okay, VINO scores 10 more points, and PV is hardly an improvement on BGP as a leave. But I do want to make the board harder for my opponent, and I think BORING does a better job of that, at least. 
>Ken: RUU B11 .URU +16 244
>Geoff: ENPRSVW 9J V.W +9 295
#note This or NEWS/PEWS/SPEWS down low? It's very close. 
>Ken: DEFIIRW N10 FID.E +36 280
>Geoff: EEINPRS 14D EREPSIN. +72 367
#note RIPENESS is a little better. I liked EREPSINS' defense, but that's not worth 4 points.
>Ken: COSY 15L COSY +47 327
>Geoff: AELORWY 12A Y.LE +28 395
#note 12H ROWELED is gorgeous...at this point, about 7:00 on my clock, I was starting to feel queasy and feverish. Was afraid I'd eaten something amiss for lunch. I had the win, so I played the endgame pretty quickly.
