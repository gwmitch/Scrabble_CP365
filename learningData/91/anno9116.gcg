#note LIQUE(FACTIONS)! PUTRE(FACTIONS)!
>David_Johnson: EIPRV 4C VIPER +27 61
>Geoff: GIMTUUY C2 GU. +14 205
#note Briefly thought about the validity of VIPERY* before thinking, oh wait, that's ridiculous...saw MINGY but didn't want to slog through UU. Wrong choice; the extra points are worth it. MY(C) for 30 is even better, weakening the S/KITTLES hook I don't have. KITTLEST/TUG kills that hook without giving back much...in short, GUV isn't a disaster but there were many better options here.
>David_Johnson: AO 2B A.O +8 69
>Geoff: EIMOTUY 1D MOIETY +49 254
#note Took some time on this play, took a while to see MOIETY for some reason, but glad I did.
>David_Johnson: ABBCNNS -ABB +0 69
>Geoff: ADMOQRU 1A OM +16 270
#note Far from best equity...figured I'd just kill the spot. I don't imagine winning percentage figures mean anything at this point. I'm not going to lose this game.

>Geoff: AEINQRU 1L .ERN +21 323
#note Didn't like all those unseen Ns and Rs. Q doesn't quite agree; HIRE and HAEN are the top simming plays.
>David_Johnson: AN E9 .AN +12 142
>Geoff: AEGIQSU 12B QUAG +36 359
#note No, I'm not putting a Q in the 3x3 with a 200 point lead.

#note UNBURIES#...UNBRUISED is ours, didn't know for sure. Onward.

#note Misscored as 79.
>Geoff: AEEENTZ 10N ZA +64 469
>David_Johnson: ILO L11 .ILO +14 251
#note Uh...yeah. I got focused on killing the 3x3 O column and didn't care much what he did elsewhere so long as he didn't open the other triple. Realized about 10 seconds after he drew, wait, there ain't no HILO*.

#note David lost 10 points on time, so the actual final score was 532-237.
