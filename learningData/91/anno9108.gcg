>Jim_Burlant: ADDEOOR 8E DODO +12 12
#note Not even one of the original kibbitzer chioces, this rapidly percolates upwards.  The 2-ply sim says this, 8H DORADO, and 8C ODORED are the standouts.
>Eric_Tran: AAELSST 7B ATLASES +70 70
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENNPR 9G sPANNER +68 80
#note Better at I8 for the same score.  Fortunately I don't get burned for this mistake.
>Eric_Tran: HNW L8 H.WN +14 84
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNPTY 8A PYA +31 111
#note Better at 6A for the same points, since it doesn't create the huge hot spot at B6.
>Eric_Tran: BER 8L .ERB +29 113
>Jim_Burlant: CEEGNTY 6A TYE +34 145
#note And the draw bails me out of my previous mistake.  Q prefers that I dump the second E with TYEE for 37 and leave myself vowelless.  I don't mind giving up the 3 points to make sure I keep a vowel, especially an E.
>Eric_Tran: EGLN 5C GLEN +15 128
>Jim_Burlant: CEGMNRU A1 URGEN. +24 169
#note No idea what to do here, so I figured I'd turn 5, score 24, and try again.   This is one of three plays that sim within 1/2 point of each other at the top of the heap, the other two being A1 GURNET and 11I REGNUM.  
>Eric_Tran: AJ N6 JA. +26 154
>Jim_Burlant: CCEFIMT 4D EMIC +26 195
#note Best.  J8 INFECT is also a good choice to unload the F and clean out more of this rack.
>Eric_Tran: IMNOT O3 INTOM. +24 178
>Jim_Burlant: CFLOOOT 4K COLO. +14 209
#note Yuck - a terrible position.  The only play that scores anything worthwhile is M7 CERO, which I didn't see.  And the FLOOT leave is so bad to me that it isn't worth it.  I just tried to turn as much of the rack as I could and try again.  I played here instead of on row 11 because I felt that he could extend the C and this would play for 14 and give back at least 30 - the game is too close for that.  Row 11 is inert unless he bingos there.  Q says CERO is best and that I should hold on to more of this clunk.
>Eric_Tran: ?BDEEOR 11H DEBO.ERs +70 248
#note 2A RESORBED scores 82.
>Jim_Burlant: AFFOQRT O11 .TAFF +33 242
#note Eric may have missed his best bingo, but it certainly helped him to do so - he blocked both of my possible plays of TRANQ.  Best play here is DRAFF for 39; I missed it.
>Eric_Tran: AEZ N11 .AZE +49 297
>Jim_Burlant: GOQRRSU F2 QU.. +33 275
#note Good thing to draw the U or I'd have been hosed without it.  I'm winning 27% with this choice.
>Eric_Tran: DKU K2 DU.K +22 319
>Jim_Burlant: GOORRSW J11 .ROW +17 292
#note No idea what else to do - I'm sitting on an S, hopefully Eric doesn't have one and can't hook it.  This is a strong choice, though 12I ROW is probably better.
>Eric_Tran: AILST 15F TAILS +25 344
>Jim_Burlant: EGIIORS A8 .IEROGIS +86 378
>Jim_Burlant: EGIIORS --  -86 292
#note And I have the winning rack...except I forget how to spell at the worst possible time.  The irony is that it should have come to me that doubling the G would have resulted in more points, too.  The correct spelling is PIROGIES.  Q says the legit bingo wins 70%; in reality, given that I would have pulled the X out of the bag (Eric told me afterwards that he didn't have it), it would have clinched the game.
