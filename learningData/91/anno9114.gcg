>Jim_Burlant: AEIIMTU 8H ETUI +8 8
#note Any number of options, ahd the difference as to what's best is stylistic preference.  Exchange IU is best, Exchange IIU second, this choice 4th, not quite 1-1/2 points down on exchange IU. I'm perfectly fine with putting this down to prevent him from scoring something like a 30+ 8D play if I can. 
>Bob_Gillis: INY 7H YIN +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: AAHIIMS 9E AMIA +13 21
#note Not paying attention to the board, as tE placement scores 18.  This is poor.  L4 AHIMSA and 6G AAH are the winners.  I think that of all the choices, AHIMSA (which I didn't know) and 6E AMIA look best.
>Bob_Gillis: DEITY 10B DEITY +38 55
>Jim_Burlant: AAAHISW 8A AWASH +42 63
#note A bit dispiriting to leave HIS and draw AAAW on a 4-tile pick, but you gotta play what you're dealt.  This is clearly best, and nothing else is worth considering.
>Bob_Gillis: ABEN 7A NABE +25 80
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIKO G5 KOA +16 79
#note EEK!  As in, I missed another good play of EEK 9A.  This is poor and exchanging probably would have been better; EEK 9A probably was the only scoring play worth making out of this vowel overloaded nonsense.
>Bob_Gillis: GOO 5D GOO. +18 98
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRTU -IU +0 79
#note Q prfers 6B RAI to this nonsense.  A 6 UNAI - didn't see it, otherwise would not have exchanged if I had.
>Bob_Gillis: DEST K7 S.TED +20 118
#note Play incorrectly scored as 18.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIORT D4 O.E.. +12 91
#note Q prefers 6B TAO by 7 points.
>Bob_Gillis: BDIRS H1 DRIBS +43 161
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILRT 1H .ETAILER +80 171
#note I had to make one good play this game, right?  This is best - given that I'm still a half step behind, I need the more open board. 
>Bob_Gillis: FGO J10 FOG +31 192
>Jim_Burlant: ?INOQWZ 6B WO. +36 207
#note And after missing however many opportunities to do something about that hot spot, I finally hit it.  This is best and I'm now winning 61%.
>Bob_Gillis: HP F4 P.H +29 221
>Jim_Burlant: ?INQRVZ 3G Q. +21 228
#note Q has a neat idea I hadn't considered:  VIZIR 3G 31; it says this choice or VIZIR are the star plays and either one is as strong as the other.
>Bob_Gillis: CER L10 REC +20 241
>Jim_Burlant: ?INPRVZ E8 ...PIN +22 250
#note Cute play, and while it doesn't do well statically, it sims quite well.  Best, however, is C2 ZIN.
>Bob_Gillis: AEMN 2L NAME +26 267
>Jim_Burlant: ??LRRVZ 12D V.ZiR +34 284
#note The rule of thumb I use regarding blanks:  with one in my rack, unless it's the end game or I have to burn it to make the game-saving  play, the blank needs to outscore the best non-blank option by somewhere around 30 points.  With two in my rack, I'll consider using oneit nets me 15 more than my next best play and scores well enough to do it.  Besides the extra points, splitting blanks has a benefit that is irrelevant to Quackle but is beneficial to a human:  no human can possibly disambiguate the 676 possibilities ina two-blank rack in seconds the way Quackle can.  Removing one of the blanks reduces that to 26 possible racks to have to figure out.   In this position the only play I can make that doesn't burn the blank is VIRL 12D, which only scores 14.  This scores 34 and unloads the junk, so it's worth it to split the blanks and play one.  Quackle agrees; Championship Player says this is best, and VIZOR is  1 point behind.  
>Bob_Gillis: DIOV 4H .OVID +22 289
>Jim_Burlant: ?ELORSX M1 ..X +20 304
#note Going for the bingo here, and I want to minimize my exposure to this pool with all the rack killers (FGJUUU) still at large.  Q wants me to take the points with REX 3M, and this is a distant second.
>Bob_Gillis: JN K3 J.N +20 309
>Jim_Burlant: ?ELORSU 14E SOiLURE +72 376
#note Best plays are O1 9's RESOLUTER and REVELROUS.  Nice finds, Quackle!  While 14B plays like CLOSURE and LOUSIER score more than this, they offer potential comeback bingos on row 15 (FELTING).  This doesn't allow him to come back unless he has a 9 in his rack.  This wins 90%.
>Bob_Gillis: LTU H11 T.U.L +15 324
>Jim_Burlant: EFILNRT 15K FLINT +32 408
>Bob_Gillis: ACEGU M7 CAGE +19 343
>Jim_Burlant: ER 8M .RE +9 417
>Jim_Burlant:  (U) +2 419
#note Final score 419 - 341.
