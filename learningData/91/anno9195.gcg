#note Game 25 of the 2011 Dallas Nationals. 
I knew this was no good. I had about 4 seconds to decide whether phoneying was the right thing to do, because if I wait any longer than that to play this, I lose my credibility. He holds, but doesn't challenge.

#note I don't think I'd have own this game without the phoneys. I felt awful doing it, but I needed the game really badly, and I took advantage of Stephen's weakness. He's a strong player, if he studied he'd be a bear to take down.
