>Richard_Spence: FLORU 8D FLOUR +24 24
#note Game 13 of the 2011 Dallas Nationals. 
>Matt_Canik: IMOSTUX 7C XI +22 22
#note Quackle prefers X(U) G7 for 17 holding IMOSTU. This sims second. 
>Richard_Spence: CEI E8 .ICE +12 36
>Matt_Canik: AMOSTTU 7G MOAT +19 41
#note Another unforgivable whiff. I don't even know what to say. clearly, I do not OUTSMA(R)T the opposition here. And for the second time in two games, I miss MAUT, to add insult to injury. 
>Richard_Spence: EINOSUV K1 NEVIOUS +77 113
>Richard_Spence: EINOSUV --  -77 36
#note clearly, he mixed up niveous. 
>Matt_Canik: EJNOSTU K5 JUST +29 70
#note I wanted to play JUN(C)O anyway, it held EST. But this blocks the bingoes I'm sure he'll see next turn. At the challenge table, he even says "I thought envious had a strange anagram". With the specify oppo rack option checked with his rack, this sims best by 4%. 
>Richard_Spence: EINOSUV L2 VINO +23 59
>Matt_Canik: EHINOOV D11 HOOVE +29 99
#note I see HOVE D11, then I see HOOVE*. I am convinced this is valid, for whatever reason. I was so surprised when Quackle told me otherwise. In this situation (assuming both are valid, which they are not), is it better to play HOOVE or just HOVE?. Sim says assuming it's not challenged, HOOVE is best by 3%. 
>Richard_Spence: ADELSUW M5 WUD +22 81
#note I can understand wanting to fish, I just don't think he can pass the 40 points that WA(V)ED gives him. Whatever, this works out for him long run!
>Matt_Canik: DEHIINR 2J HI.ED +40 139
#note points!
>Richard_Spence: ?ELPSTZ 15A SPa.TZLE +212 293
#note I yell, a little too loud, "FUCK." Because really, that's all you can say. 

But in all seriousness, nice play Richard. 
>Matt_Canik: GINQRRY 3I QI +26 165
#note I'm done with commentary this game now.
