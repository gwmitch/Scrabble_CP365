>Matt_Canik: DDEELRR 8D REDDER +18 18
#note Game 10 of the Dallas 2011 Nationals. I REALLY want this game, so I'm gonna give Joey my best.
I didn't know REDDLE, but REDDER sims less than .4% behind it after 500 iterations. Spent about three minutes on the rack because I couldn't decide if fishing or scoring was a better option. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EEE -EEE +0 0
>Matt_Canik: BEFFGLT E5 BEG.T +16 34
#note Tough rack, spent another three or four minutes thinking here. This actually sims best. Go me!
>Joey_Krafchick: ABEHO F2 OBEAH +37 37
>Matt_Canik: FFLNORS D5 OF +19 53
#note I feel like most of the options on this board are handing him points the next turn. This feels soundly defensive to me and forces him to open up something for me. Sim doesn't like it too much, keeping it 2% below (D)OFF, the top play. But given the opponent, I do. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEISTU 3F .EAUTIES +74 111
#note So much for defense.
>Matt_Canik: FILLNRS H1 FR.IL +27 80
#note Swing and a miss. FLAIL? ok, past matt, g1. 
>Joey_Krafchick: IVW L1 VI.W +28 139
>Matt_Canik: AAEKLNS 7I ALKANES +66 146
#note Glad my stupid error actually benefits me. What I'm more glad for, though, is that I hit a bingo outside his range that's inside my range. Makes me feel like my studying earned me this game, perhaps. 
>Joey_Krafchick: ?AAMNPZ O7 .PAZ +45 184
#note He was bragging about playing spaz over AMAZoN(S) 81. That's why I know the rack. and yes, spaz is better. 
>Matt_Canik: IJORSYY 5J JOY +40 186
#note Herp.
>Joey_Krafchick: ??ALMNT L7 .NTiMALe +68 252
>Matt_Canik: DHIRSTY 14H DITH.RY +30 216
#note I liked this play when I made it. Yet it's simming over 10% behind the (now clear) top choice. I guess I fell too enamored/concerned with the TLS-DWS spot and overlooked THY K10 38 entirely. But simming 7% above the pack, THY is clearly right. (I was also fishing for the challenge)
>Joey_Krafchick: DILNQRT 13I QI +44 296
>Matt_Canik: AEINSSV 15B VINASSE +92 308
#note See SAVINES/VINASSE immediately, but then start questioning whether it's SAVINES or SAVEINS (mixing up the ACEINSS rack). VINASSE still scores a truckload, so I take the safer option. Another mistake on my behalf. 
>Joey_Krafchick: CEOPU F10 COUPE. +18 314
>Matt_Canik: AEGINTT M12 GI.T +17 325
#note Oh, now what do I do? Fish? Go for points? Something else? I don't want to leave double Ts with something like VIGA or VAGI 1L. GI(R)T scores and keeps a leave that will likely be able to do SOMETHING regardless of what I pull next turn. 
>Joey_Krafchick: OO 15M .OO +14 328
>Matt_Canik: AEEGNTU 1L .ATU +21 346
#note Scores a lot. I don't want to or need to play for the bingo here, I think I can eke this one out just by outrunning him now. 
>Joey_Krafchick: MO 6M OM +22 350
>Matt_Canik: DEEGINW 11B WIGE.N +20 366
#note I spent probably 8 minutes on this rack. I will get *some* points this turn, but with the X unseen I'm worried he can hit a cheap play with it for a lot. WIGEON empties the bag, which looks dangerous, no doubt. But it holds DE, which will likely lead to an out in 2 for me. It scores the most points of any available play. It kills off a spot where he could hit his X for 30. Most importantly, for whatever reason, it sims the best by a good 1% over REWIN d8 and WODGE 11E, and 10% more than anything else. I don't really know why this play sims so well. It just looked right to me. 
>Joey_Krafchick: ACNORRX 10A RAX +28 378
#note Joey has twi wins here and 15 minutes on his clock. After about 8 minutes, I notice that AXON plays at K9 for a ton of points. (it's really hard to spot overlap plays next to a blank, no?). After 13 minutes, he still hasn't. The clear best play is the filthy OXCAR(T)/DO/EX/ARC 9G. The only other winning play is AXON. For whatever reason, though, Joey whiffs that. 
>Matt_Canik: DEEILNU K11 ED +19 385
#note This is my best play, it leaves either LUNIE(R) A9 or LINEU(P) 13A as outs for 16 or 13, respectively. 
>Joey_Krafchick: CNOR 9G ORC +23 401
>Matt_Canik: EILNU A5 LUNIE. +18 403
>Matt_Canik:  (N) +2 405
#note Phewwwww. I made a couple mistakes, especially VINASSE and DITHERY, but played a hell of an endgame and pulled it out. One of my favorite games of the tournament, because of the opponent and the spread (and, of course, the result).
