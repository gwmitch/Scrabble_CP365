#note All the good plays are on the B column here - not sure why I didn't take that spot except that I liked the idea of opening many parts of the board against a lower-rated player who I suspected might want to clog it. B6 plays like LAUD, DAUNT or LANDAU are much better, though, I agree. Overthought it at the time, maybe. (Wasn't absolutely sure of the validity of ACTUALS#, but I probably wouldn't have tried it.)

#note Blocked BIDENTAL...didn't think of BLANDER 10B or ELAND L8. BLANDER sims a little better, but I think I'd have gone with ELAND. I don't want to close the board.

#note I did well during the tournament about not rushing and being impulsive, but this was an exception. And I haven't studied fives in way too long, apparently. Surely I was thinking of FRITT, but who cares, the better play of WINTLE is sitting right there! I found it next turn, but that's one turn too late. Slow down!

>Geoff: EFOOSTX 13I FOX +32 174
#note OXO 10B sims as well as FOX does. I don't see it...yeah, OXO is more defensive. (I did briefly consider OX 10B, but that's too easy to either take or block.)

>Geoff: EINOSTT D6 T.. +5 179
#note D4 SNO(OP)IE(S)T 44, whoa! Well, you see what I'm trying to do - even if he plays ATOP, there's a good chance I'll get a playable bingo. Q doesn't agree. It wants to fish off O or OT. RITZ for 22 isn't bad either (assuming the superstar play isn't found.)
>Bob's_Bible: ?AIMNOU 5C MANItOU +72 292
#note Misscored as 74.
>Geoff: EGINOST H1 GENT.O +24 203
#note Egads, not sure what if anything gives me a chance. This seems too blockable. GO 10A is kind of interesting.
>Bob's_Bible: ?ADEEPS 1C PrESA.ED +61 353
>Geoff: EEGIISU E10 E.UI +4 207
#note Bob was already super low on time, and he went way over finding his bingo. (He didn't know GAPESEED.) I mean, like five minutes over. It almost looked like he might go over SO far that I could pull it out. Bizarre...surely he'll block next, no matter what I do. GIE 2A at least threatens something and he might not be able to block absolutely everything.
>Bob's_Bible: BNOY 3F BO.NY +12 365
>Geoff: EEGIQSV C10 Q. +11 218
#note Figured 2B QI would just get underlapped, but still, not sure what the purpose of this play was. I made it quickly and left one in the bag in hopes of forcing him even further overtime than the six minutes he was already at. Not that there's much point in doing so now.

#note The play here was 3A OE, threatening OGIVES or GIVES/ETUIS.
