#note Not sure why I didn't just play VAN here - I like ANOT better than INOT on the resulting board, but not by four points. 
>Ed: DEEHSTU 12C E.THUSED +63 85
#note Misscored as 64.
>Geoff: AENNOTU J5 UNATONE. +63 103
#note Too cute. Just play TONNEAU 13I and take your chances, dude.
>Ed: AQSW 5H SQ.AW +34 119
#note (OLD)SQUAW now in play
>Geoff: AFGIKNO H1 KAIF. +48 151
#note Didn't think of SQUAWK/FAKING - too focused on H1. KAIFS clearly better than FINKS, so glad I didn't just jump on FINKS, which I saw first. FAKING sims a point better.

>Geoff: DEGIMMU 13L GEM +36 308
#note No question this play is right, but I'm needing a lot of help now.
>Ed: AEEORTV 1F TA.EOVER +66 420
>Geoff: DGIIIMU -DGIIIMU +0 308
#note As I was saying, I need help. Three helicopters, two tanks and an aircraft carrier would be a nice start. (It's between x7 and keep M for 13G.)
>Ed: BEILORS O1 EROSIBL. +83 503
>Geoff: ACDEFIL 13H ID +15 323
#note Q likes cashing F(LAM)E now, which I saw but passed up. Obviously can't win. Not sure what I thought I was blocking here - Ed has the blank most likely, but he's also got the junk I threw in.
>Ed: DHIIIMU G7 I.IDI.M +24 527
#note Nice!
>Geoff: ?ACEFGL 4K FACE. +35 358
>Ed: HU B5 UH +25 552
#note Actually had Ed mistracked with HL here, but blocking UH wouldn't have been worth it.
