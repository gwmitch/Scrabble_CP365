>springfield: AAEIORV 8D VARIA +24 24
#note Seems like the right play, though some of the shorter stuff sims in the neighborhood. I don't like drawing to AEIR, too many things can go wrong. Play long, and hope to not get too vowel heavy (VIREO comes in second statically, but drops in the runoff). Coincidentally, the opposite ended up happening soon enough. 
>austin: DEEEINO D4 ENDI.E +20 20
#note Sim pings back and forth between this and VIDEO D8. VEINED D8 is the third choice.
>springfield: DEGLOOT C3 GOO +12 36
#note I really had no idea here (took a long turn), but CP agrees if you rank them by winning percentage. C1 LOGO is a modest valuation winner, but I wonder if Quackle overrates plays that slot into triple lanes sometimes, because human players are more likely to play defense than Quackle's simulator will - thus, these plays are getting overrated for the artificially-high triple-triple potential. And of course Quackle won't miss a triple-triple if it has it, while a hack like me often will.
>austin: AEEFOPU C9 FOU +19 39
#note Just about every candidate play is going to shed the F and multiple vowels, with the U headed out of town. FEU G9 is Quackle's preferred way to  this, FEU C9 second, FOU C9 third and FEU B4 fourth. I often wonder on leaves, are you better with duplicated Es or unique vowels? Is it better to draw to AEOP early in the game or AEEP?
>springfield: CDELNTT 12A CELT +25 61
#note This grades out sixth on the CP choices, not far behind the other stuff but I see why the other options are better. CUTTLED at 11B (a word I don't know) has a purpose, basically blow this rack up and start over. CULT 11B is a reasonable fish because it keeps the E. Had I seen ATTEND E8, I probably play it. CELT is two valuation points and one winning-percentage point behind CUTTLED.
>austin: ABCEEPP A12 .APE +24 63
#note CP posts six plays that are all between 38-39 percent to win and 16-18 on valuation: APP 7F, CAPPER F3, BECAP 9H, BECAP 7H, BICEP G7 and CAPE A12. For a human player, I don't see anything wrong with taking the points and blocking the best area, which CAPE does. There are probably stylistic arguments for the other choices, but I don't see a star play here. 
>springfield: DENTTWZ G7 W.Z +29 90
#note This felt like an auto-play and I probably slapped it down way too quickly; there are more viable options than I realized. WIZ at 7C is CP's preferred option, keep the board open for the floaters that work with my rack (and score one more point, at that). It's a clear mistake to muck the board up, negating floaters and taking away potential hook areas (even if he overlaps the middle of the board, I'd have a hook shot if not for this wrong play). NERTZ F6 (didn't see it) and TAWED E7 also run out in front of my choice.
>austin: ABCEIMP 9G .AP +19 82
#note CP's runaway preference is PIMP 14A. It also prefers ZIP and ZEP to ZAP, which is interesting. Another rack-cleaning option is BONACI 5B. 
>springfield: DENRTTW 5B W..T +14 104
#note There are a lot of better plays available here, most of them from E7 (a spot I felt I was looking at all game): TAWED, DAWT, TAWER, DAWEN, DAWN. NEWER at B11 is worth considering for the 33 points, even with the DTT leave. WONT flushes nine winning-percentage points and eight valuation points, though Quackle still considers me a mild favorite in this position.
>austin: BCEILMU 10H LIMB +21 103
#note Quackle suggests a series of rack-cleaning plays from the P at 14A, with PUBLIC the clear winner and PLUMBIC a clear second. PUMICE, PUBIC and PILEUM also rate mention before it heads elsewhere. 
>springfield: DEEJNRT 10B J. +25 129
#note CP slightly prefers JIN 7C over JO 19B, but it's very close. DJIN at 7B is the third choice.
>austin: ACEIOU 11I CIAO +31 134
#note One tile missing from rack, but this is probably the runaway winner anyway. Nice vision on the underlap; as silly as this might sound, sometimes I get a little myopic and miss hooks from letters that aren't typically friendly hook letters. Good players don't have that problem.
>springfield: DEEGNRT 12K GED +20 149
#note Here's where I need to be calm, patient, and go through the channels of having a good turn. Instead, I looked at my rack, frustrated to be looking at this tease collection for so long, and I made a lazy play. There are a bunch of good ways to score by underlaping the last play (and draw to a promising leave), but I'm pretty sure I made a mediocre and quick play born of semi-frustration. EDGER at 12I scores 38, and you can get in the mid-30s for EGRET 12I, EDGE 12I, TERNE 12H. DREG at 12J gets 27, and even GED in a different spot (12H) is better than what I went with. I'd like to think most of the time I see the proper way to handle this position and I go through the right channels, but I know I didn't here. A good refresher lesson. Quackle punishes me seven WP points and 11 points of equity. (Play misscored at 18, because I was obviously point-banking.)
>austin: DEFNRSU 13E REFUNDS +73 207
#note There are five bingos here; Quackle says go with PREFUNDS 14A (82 points, 76.46 WP, 78.9 valuation) and take your chances on the counterplay. The other four: FUNDERS N6 (77/74/74), FUNDERS 13E (70/73/73), REFUNDS 13E (73/73/73), REFUNDS N6 (71/71/70). I supose the Q threat off off REFUNDS 13E isn't as great as usual, since it likely would have been dumped at 7C had I drawn it earlier (and I've only drawn three on my last pick). It's still a rich comeback area though, obviously. 
>springfield: ?EINRST 15A .SuRIENT +74 223
#note Finally filled my blue-hair save, well, I overfilled it with S and ? on a three-pick. The six bingos from A15 rank the best and all score 74, though four choices are preferred to my play: ENTERIcS, ENlISTER, ETeRNISE and ETERNISe. I flush about three equity points here, and I'm a slight dog at 47 percent.
>austin: ELORSVX 14A .OX +36 243
#note OX at 12G is a little better, scores three more points and draws to the same rich leave. This leave also holds some OX fronthooks if a balancing turn is needed on the next rack (including the often-undesirable V and the mediocre L, though ELRSV is a tasty leave if a vowel comes). Quackle favors OX by five WP points and seven valuation points, which probably has more to do with the OX hooks than the three-point difference in raw score. At least, that's all I can think of.
>springfield: BHOQRTY 14F YO +33 256
#note Three candidate plays here, YO, AHOY E8 and QI 7C. I almost went for AHOY to maximize picks to what will be an awkward save no matter what, but I instead decided to take max points and hope for the cheap Q dump to hang around (or maybe I'll do a long exchange next turn). Wasn't sure it if was right, but CP clearly prefers YO (40/26) over AHOY (35/19) and QI (34/18). 
>austin: ?EKLRSV 7C K. +11 254
#note If you know 14,000 sevens, you can bingo here. The word isn't in my book. But it's interesting that several fishes sim a little better, with KI at the front. Even some fishes that hold the K sim better, stuff like EVIL 7B, ERVIL 7A and VEIL 7B. 
>springfield: BEHHQRT E7 R.T +16 272
#note A bad play. Didn't know RATHE E7, which is best. RAH or TAHR or RATH (which I almost played) in the same spot would be an improvement, or perhaps an exchange into -HERT. I flushed eight WP points and 13 equity points.
>austin: ?AELRSV N8 REViSAL +90 344
#note Very nice; easily the best bingo and the one that puts the game in the most secure position. REVISAL is 85 percent to win, while the cheaper bingos (69-75 points) are around 74-76 percent to win.
>springfield: BDEHHIQ 8L HE.B +39 311
#note HERB felt like an autoplay, but HEH O7 is close. I'm going to have to be pretty lucky from here on out.
>austin: GILNORU O13 GOR +17 361
#note CP likes going long here, with M3 LOUNGER scoring 25 and winning 87 percent of the time. Interesting. Other long plays follow in the same spot, LIGURE and LOUNGE.  GOR wins, per the Duck, 76 percent of the time. The long plays feel a little counter-intuitive, but LOUNGER does save an I and make six picks at the case S. 
>springfield: DHIMQ M7 H.M +22 333
#note Incomplete rack. With Austin in time trouble, quick playing was a part of the strategy. Didn't have a T, and didn't consider the A hook at the time, but liked how this at least scored and opened possibilities. 
>austin: AILNOTU 6I OUTLAIN +70 431
#note The dagger. Austin saw it right away, too, which is crisp play considering that the A-HEM hook, while common, can be easy to forget. 
>springfield: DIINQY I6 .Y +9 342
#note Incomplete rack. Hoping for miracle U for QUININ O1.
>austin: AEEINST 5G EAT +9 440
#note Quackle would play off one tile here, with O6 NAB the preference (that takes the QI spot down a notch, and if I foolishly open, Austin might bingo out).
>springfield: ADEIINQ 5N QI +24 366
#note The obvious play. 
>austin: EINSU 6A NE +11 451
#note CP would play SUIT K3, then go out with NE next turn. And this also blocks DENIAL on the other side, though I don't see it.
>springfield: ADEIN 5K AE +10 376
#note Blocking SUIT is nice, but playing DENIAL L1 for my own out is better. NIDATE K2 is also available to end the game. Sloppy.
>austin: ISU A6 .US +9 460
#note The key here is to note that it's not a good board for a naked I: nowhere to play one, other than with the S just exposed.
>springfield: DIN 8A .I +2 378
#note The only I spot. 
>austin: I -  +0 460
>springfield: DN L4 D.. +8 386
#note Playing out in one shot with DUNT H12 is the best option.
>austin: I -  +0 460
>springfield: N H4 N. +3 389
#note Well played, Austin. Always enjoy our games, no matter how many mistakes I might make.
>springfield:  (I) +2 391
