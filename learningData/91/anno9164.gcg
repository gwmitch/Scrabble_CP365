#note This is okay, I guess, but I don't play closed versus Dave.  He kinda likes that.  Q recommends 5D (N)OGG 12.
>Dave_Leifer: AEFN H4 FAEN. +12 48
#note Yeah.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGMRTY I3 GEY +19 76
#note Oh, for an O.  Best.

#note Had to close it up, didn't he?  He said he had no vowels.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEHIMTZ 3D .HEZ +28 130
#note This is the play where I lose, I think.  There's some awesome stuff here.  Of note: BI(CONVEX) D1 25 (though not nearly best).  I put him on a fish with some decent consonants.  There's two places to bingo, one a little harder.  If he bingos from GERM, the board gets locked down and I'm in trouble.  It's not REHIT* (ITHER, THEIR).  But REMIT would have worked.  Best, though, is HE(R)MIT for 32, which I really like.  Forks the board, lets us breathe.  REMIT, coming back for CHEZ with an E redraw is fine too.  I think I just overthought this.  Even HIM would be fine.  I just wish ZIBET(H) woulda gone down.  :P  CHEZ doesn't even rank -- I'm surprised at that.  I wanted to clean up my rack, and thought that did okay.
>Dave_Leifer: DIQ 7J Q.ID +16 94
>Ryan_Fischer: ABIMRTT J9 .AMBIT +15 145
#note Still BI(CONVEX).  2E AB (gives a lot back).  Ditto, AM.  7C B(E)M(O)A(N) is cool.  M9 (M)IMBAR (!).  My GAMBIT did not work.  I figured he'd hit me.  I coulda weathered it had it not been this hard, but I really shouldn't make this play without the blank or S already in hand.  Impatient much, and I pay for it.
>Dave_Leifer: ?DEIPST 15D DEPIcTS +95 189
#note PODITES and PEPTIDS are 98.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEORRTT 13G ORB.TER +26 171
#note E2 T(H)RO 22.  Better 'cause it slows it down, keeps those lanes open.
>Dave_Leifer: AKUW 12L WAUK +44 233
#note ...and doesn't allow THAT.
>Ryan_Fischer: AELNRST N1 RENTALS +83 254
#note Bleh, I shoulda chose ANTLERS.  No way I coulda known that, though.
>Dave_Leifer: AJU 1L JU.A +57 290
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: IIIILPY -IIIILY +0 254
#note D11 LIPI(D) 16 is just silly, as is PILI.  I kept the P for something to build on, score with.  Q, if you exchange, says keeping LY here is best.
>Dave_Leifer: DOOS 11G DOO.S +16 306
#note Well, that pretty much dooms me!
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENOOP 2E OP +25 279
#note Slow and score (and hope he can't use the opening).
>Dave_Leifer: AIRY 1F AIRY +26 332
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELNOV 6B VA. +17 296
#note 14B OVEN 19 gives me some hooks to work with.  38% win.  I opened the lane with VA(V).  Longshot, and who knows if there's anything to hit.  One day I'll learn to actually calculate that.
>Dave_Leifer: IOS O12 .OIS +24 356
