#note I saw OUTTOWER before his turn but forgot about it when he blocked and made this spot.  He knew it anyway, so it wouldn't have mattered.

#note D4 U(P)O 10 looks okay.  I considered KOI and AUGITE but it's really not necessary to make a play like that.  I thought anything at M9 expending the S is overkill and my big concern was that he'd get a bingo down.  But still, through the S is a baby bingo... right?  And I'll be able to counter... right?

#note Really?  VIA for 18?  Feh.  MI(R)ES for 39 is cute.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIMRU O7 MA +22 348
#note I thought about URAEMIC but didn't want to empty the bag.  Champ likes 6M A(V)E, winning 69%.  I just wanted to take out a likely painful scoring spot.  Champ sim likes EAU 4B.
>Gregg_Speicher: AAHY J2 YAH +25 340
#note Nice setup.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGIRU D2 GRI.ED +24 372
#note Perfect play loses if he finds SiALI(C).  DI(R)ER is best.  GRIPED is 2nd.  This game should not have been that close.  Yeesh.
