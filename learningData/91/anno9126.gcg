#note Hmmm.  Q prefers passing up the points and clearing the dreck with 5E HAVE, but it's more a matter of style preference than clear-cut right/wrong.  This sims less than 1/2 point down at 1000 2-ply iterations.
>Charles_Reinke: AABCELT 8G T.ACABLE +65 93
#note Whoops!  The legitimate 8's are CARTABLE and BRACTEAL. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?HIOSTV N8 .IgHTVOS +76 110
#note Any number of much better choices here, but you have to know them to play them.  TOVARISH K5 scores 102 and is best; the other option that I didn't know is yESHIVOT N7 which scores 92.  This is 3rd best.  While this is the best play I was capable of finding, one thing that doesn't show up in any annotation is that I burned a lot of time (at least 4 minutes) finding this play, which wins 47%.  TOVARISH wins 102.

#note Another  position that required several minutes for me to find the best play, as it took me a while to realize just how many overlaps I had in this rack.  This is best; HANGS J2, which I initially put down before pulling it up, sims roughly 3-1/2 points down.

#note When I saw the Q? in my rack, I was beginning to think this was really looking like my game.   As for this position -  CROFT 12J is a little better for turnover and defense, taking away the easy S hook on CUP; I missed it.  Outside of CROFT or COFT, all the best options are exchanges.
>Charles_Reinke: EIN 13L NE.I +26 159
>Jim_Burlant: ?DELQRT K7 Q.T +14 198
#note Best.  Outside of this, the only options that aren't exchanges are LUDE 9I and 4H WONDER.

>Jim_Burlant: ?DELRRT E6 RET.LD +14 212
#note Critical position and now my downward spiral begins.  Zyzzyva reveals that there is no 8 through the O.  Too bad I had to burn nearly 5 minutes to come to that conclusion myself.  And for some reason, I couldn't find LORD E8, which is winning the sim and looking like the best play out of a  weak lot.  The sim says this isn't bad, only docking me 3-1/2 points and I'm still winning 86%, but I should not have turned so much of this rack.  LORD should have been the play.  
>Charles_Reinke: EE 10E .EE +13 180
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEJRU 8A JURA. +39 251
#note Best, winning 95%.  Not too worried about leaving duplicated E's since (a) I have the blank and (b) there are only 2 E's unseen.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEINOS C5 ANE.OIDS +61 241
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEETY D3 DYE +16 267
#note You've got to be kidding me - EIIIIIOOO in the bag and I draw the case E and no I's on a 4-tile pick with two E's already in my rack?  Anyway - with the blank in hand, more time burned trying to find the bingo that isn't there (this combination of tiles doesn't even make any 8's). And after burning time trying to find the bingo, I still burned more time trying to evaluate the position.  The unseen XI frightened me, but plays defending the X could have just as easily backfired and given back just as much if he missed the X and instead  he had AFOR, AFNO, or AMOR in his rack - very possible given that he had just drawn 7.  I opted to gamble that he whiffed on the X and felt I should wait to see what he put down on his next turn.   I put this down quickly, forgetting that DEY would have scored 5 more.  Sim likes B12 EYED best.

#note The bingos don't play, so another head scratcher position.  2-ply sim liks B5 WE, 3B WIDE, and K1 WIST.  Considered C2 WE but thought it'd be too easy for him to block for at least 30, and my resulting bingo doesn't play.  I thought that if I could set up an S hook, even a 65-point airball would be enough to clinch the game.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EIILPS K1 LIP +21 302
#note Now I'm down under 1 minute and am blind to the board.   I saw ImPLIES in my rack but didn't see the F column.  Having said that, the sim says this was a good bingo to whiff on; this play wins 39.8% to the bingo's 40.7%.    At this point I notice the L in TRACABLE* and think that if I can divert his attention from the M column, I might find a bingo ending in LS to win the game.
>Charles_Reinke: IKNO D12 OINK +30 368
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFIIOS C2 OI +10 312
#note Desperation.  Terrible draw for this stage of the game and I'm under 30 seconds.  M6 FILO is the sim's choice but I'm fixated on bingoing through the L with something ending in LS at this point.  Hopefully this will give him a distraction if he thinks I might be able to hook OI with my blank.
>Charles_Reinke: M 2B M. +8 376
#note Annotation ends here due to my time pressure, so I'll summarize what happens.  He has no block for the L column and he plays somewhere cheap for 8, but I can't remember where. I think he blocked the F column ) and emptied the bag in doing so, but I'm not sure.  I'm sitting on AEFIRS? and try the desperation play of FAERIES/TRACABLES*, which he challenges off the board.  He plays for 30 (on row 15?), and I'm so fixated on bingoing *through* the L that I neglect to look for bingos *to* the L.  I miss FoRESAI(L), go almost 2 minutes over on time, and I lose 402 - 321 after deducting my time penalty.  If I manage my time better, I give myself an 80% chance that I pull this one out.  A very tough loss, but I just didn't manage the game well enough to win.
