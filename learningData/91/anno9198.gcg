>Matt_Canik: AELPRRU G7 PUR +21 21
#note LARRUPE(D) is a word I have never seen before. Aside from that, PUR looks right. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: CIOTTU 12B OUTCIT. +24 106
>Matt_Canik: AEILNNR 13A LIN +12 33
#note I hate making 1-tile fishes that score 6 points. is (PA)N right? or NIDAL 10F? or this? They all sim really close together. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: AGH I7 HAG +34 140
>Matt_Canik: AEEINRR 11H .INER +10 43
#note Yeah, I'm getting mad now. This gives me stuff to play through, and I've still got the -ED spot starting from 10A. LINER sucks, but so does everything else. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: BEGOOS L6 GOOBE.S +22 162

#note I throw my pen down, pick it up and start writing the score, then notice RO and challenge right before he draws. Phew. 
>Matt_Canik: AEEENRT 6J ER. +6 49
#note I can't catch a fuckin break. But I guess I just did with his phoney RO*. Anyway, here's what I'm thinking: I know he has TRANCHES, but I don't expect him to see that. And even if he does, he gives me an S in a 3x3 line while I'm fishing. Now for whatever reason, I think PAH takes an S, and I decide I should block that spot, forcing him to see TRANCHES, which, again, I doubt he sees, and even if he does, I may 3x3. Twisted, effed up logic here. But that was my thought process. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: AEHNRST E8 TRAN.HES +76 238
>Matt_Canik: ?AAEENT 15E .ErENATA +74 123
#note No 3x3s, this is highest-scoring bingo. On a side note, I've scored 49 points after 5 plays. Wowwwwww.
>Jacob_Bergmann: EKY 14J KEY +43 281
#note At least it wasn't the Z. 
>Matt_Canik: EIMOSTV 8A VOMI. +33 156
>Jacob_Bergmann: ACMNOR M2 MACRON +30 311
>Matt_Canik: EFIISST 14E .F +26 182
#note Playing off one tile lengthens the game, gives me more chances to draw bingoes and come back. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: Q D7 Q. +11 322
>Matt_Canik: EIIOSST M13 IS +15 197
#note O(M)IT 2L is an interesting option, opens up two lines so he can't block both. 
>Jacob_Bergmann: AEGL K3 GLA.E +15 337
>Matt_Canik: DEIIOST 9L .IO +6 203
#note IDIO(L)E(C)TS. I knew the word, too. FFF.

#note Maybe had I hit the first turn bingo LARRUPED this game would have gone differently. I didn't play flawlessly, but I did to the best of my ability. Not knowing PAH didn't take an S certainly hurt me, but oh well, I was down like 170-49 at the time anyway. I didn't play great, I could have (perhaps) won with larruped. I can't call this unwinnable because (maybe) it wasn't.
