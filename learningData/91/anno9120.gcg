#note 7B SWEETEN or 7E TWINERS are just as good, despite the lower scores, for their defensive value. Should have considered them more, though this is fine too.
>Tony: AH 10F HA. +32 59
>Geoff: CDOPRRZ 11G R.PCORD +24 118
#note Thought about CROZE/R and PREZ too. Each play has its advantages...PREZ edges out RIPCORD in the sim. I think it does offer a bit more board control.
>Tony: AEX 10M AXE +29 88
>Geoff: ADEEINZ O6 AZIN. +42 160
#note Um, AZIDE is a word. Though DEE is better than EEN here, and AZINE actually sims a smidge ahead. Quackle prefers just ZEE by 4-5 points, which I did think of but didn't like ADEIN into a pool with 8 Is, among other things. But AZIDE/AZINE have their own issues.

>Geoff: DEEGILT D8 G.IDE +18 178
#note Don't think I generated enough candidates here. 9M GEN 22 I think I like best. Quack likes N2 LEGIT, even with the E back hook offered.

#note BOURGS in the same spot is better.
>Tony: EH 6I EH +26 262
#note Didn't like seeing this play - didn't want a shut down board at this point.
>Geoff: AMOOSTV 13A MOA +21 287
#note Ooh, J10 OCTAVO is pretty. Gotta look everywhere...MOA is second best.
>Tony: IP N8 PI. +26 288
>Geoff: INORSTV J9 VI.TOR +15 302
#note Now it gets interesting. Tony already knows from BURGS that I've got the last S, but short of a good VICTOR/Y play, he'll either have to block for not much or take his chances. VICTOR sims best, though in a sim the static player won't block there as often, so I wouldn't assume the sim is right. Not much else is appealing, though.

#note 5C FONTAL is 4 better (given best out play in response).
