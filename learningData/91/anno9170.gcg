#note ok ok. after 10,000 iterations, this does edge out JEED. i was mad at myself for not playing JEED immediately.

#note oh geez, exchange C ??? or 7J EN for two? what a crazy sim. ENDING must be a good leave. (-6)
>steve_g: AENORTU 11A OUTEARN +77 99
#note that's annoying. worth noting: dumping the extra N on DJIN for me sims MUCH worse. so i'm glad i didn't do it, but it was surprising.

#note jeez, when simming this game i forgot about DJINNI. oh and i missed ARENE F10. (-2.5)

>cesar: DEELNOR L7 RELO.NED +70 181
#note this is what happened this turn (keep in mind i'm 1-2, still thinking about the siri loss and MOGGED, and annoyed that he had OUTEARN, ZOOIER and QI, and in a bad mood because i didn't start 6-1, and pretty unfocused). i laid down DOLE after a lot of thinking about how to fish this best. "15", i said half-heartedly. i'm about to hit the clock when i pick up the rack and audibly ask "what am i doing" and lay down OLEANDER. "that's much better", he says. then i pick up the rack again and play RELOANED, and hit the clock and shake my head.

>cesar: FGMNOPR M13 FOP +29 210
#note i thik it's safe to assume his rack is BEGILSS. i'm maybe trying to get him to play BLISS for 40 and get rid of his Ss, i'm not sure why this would at all be a good idea, though. clearly this sims horribly - even with the 4-ply sim. of course, i didn't see any of the plays at 8A or even looked much there. GONOF/PROOF should be easier to see. actually, i did see GROOM now that i think of it. (-21.5)
>steve_g: BEGILSS M3 BILGES +25 204
#note but BLISS still doesn't sim best. 8A BIGOS does. part of the reason why FOP simmed so badly is because of the 16 extra points my opponent gets for BLISS from the static evaluator the first turn. i should probably give myself some equity back, right?

#note !
>cesar: BEEGLSY N1 BEY +24 333
#note i guess BELS is a much stronger leave than GELS. i think i ws trying to be cute and overlap it if he bingoed, or something really dumb like that. boy am i glad i was more focused later in the tourney! (-7)

#note "let's see SLEETING, STEELING, there's a third one.. ah, of course, GENTILES" -- begin going for letters -- WAIT A SECOND, A GENTILE IS A NON JEW, THAT IS CAPITALIZED AND NOT GOOD! wait is EEGILNT good? no that doesn't look familiar. oh goodness is this embarrassing, i don't know any words!  (-54)
>steve_g: ?IMOSTU -  +0 308
#note he challenged! 
>cesar: ?AINOT O1 IT +20 373
#note as we walked up to the computer i thought i was going nuts and made up a word. i was relieved to see it come back good, and he said something to the effect of "i had to challenge, the only way i'm going to win is if it's phony". then i spent the next 5 minutes or so trying to find the optimal endgame and mentally relaxing - "i'm going to be 2-2 and we're going to lunch.. that's not too bad.. and i beat a 1900. ok, will go 3-0 in the afternoon and have a good day. ok, the best thing is to take out OM at O1 and then go out elsewhere.. anon or something, i don't care, i'm gonna win anyway, i'm hungry.(-55)
