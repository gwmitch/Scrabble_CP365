>Matt_Canik: EEENRSW 14B RESEW +39 290
#note RESEWN scores more, makes for a harder overlap. Shoulda played that. 
>Scott_Garner: INOSY 15E NOISY +31 266
>Matt_Canik: AELNOTU N11 .UAL +10 300
#note Given the board and the two unseen blanks, I think this is right. Kill that D before he hits it. 
>Scott_Garner: AABEHNU O13 BAH +30 296
>Matt_Canik: DEHINOT K9 HI. +21 321
#note Sims best. 
>Scott_Garner: INU 8L .UIN +12 308
>Matt_Canik: DEENOPT 2J .OPED +20 341
#note DEPONE(N)T wins this game for sure. MOPED blocks a good amount of bingo lanes, and with the K and Y in the bag I don't think there's a GOOD chance he has anything. And if he does, it'll be for 59 points and I can potentially still outrun him. Quackle gives MOPED the second-highest win %, behind the bingo. 
>Scott_Garner: ??CEIRU 1L URIC +31 339
#note sECURI(N)g, sCIURi(N)E, bRUCI(N)Es, probably more. He spent 10 minutes looking, but with 2 blanks and a tough spot it's tough to hit stuff. 
>Matt_Canik: AEKNRTY M13 KAY +41 382
#note I saw K(E)NT/JINK/NU/TAB, but this is clearly better. 
>Scott_Garner: ??AEN B4 .uEANs +15 354
#note Didn't have to be as close as it was, DEPONE(N)T woulda locked this game up for me. But all in all, I think I played very well and earned this one. Scott's a good player, I don't think I'll get lucky enough for him to miss bingoes the next time we play.
