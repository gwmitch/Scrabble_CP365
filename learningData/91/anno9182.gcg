#note Set down WAIN A5 then picked it up, he told me later he balked on it. 
>Matt_Canik: AIMORTU A1 AMU +18 120
#note MAUT plays in the same spot for 13 more, but for whatever reason I don't recognize MAUT at all. Even now, I don't recognize it. Wow.

#note As much as I hate plays like this (no skill), I have to make it here.

#note whiffffff, orzo is so hard for me to see
>Alan_Stern: GG M7 G.G +14 262
>Matt_Canik: HIILRRT K8 .HIRR +14 280
#note I like the defensive parts of this play, especially on a board that is quickly shutting down. 
>Alan_Stern: AENPPS 12F NAPPE.S +28 290
>Matt_Canik: EIILQTU K2 QU.I +26 306
#note Terrible. Just terrible. Probably the worst mistake I'll make all tournament. (QUILT B10). Pass QI 3I here because the 2J line is asking for 50 points, with an H and a K unseen.

#note Now I see it! damnit me.

#note FUCK. 
>Matt_Canik: EFGHLOT 13L HEFT +25 361
#note Well despite being a total bonehead each of the last two turns, I might have a chance to win this game! What's in the bag? AEENRRST?. Ok, never mind. I'm going to lose. I have to hope that he can't hit anything from the K and still try to outrun him. Quackle says HEFT gives me a 24% chance, nothing else offers anything good. 
>Alan_Stern: ?AENRST 15H .ERATiNS +86 429
#note gg. I sucked this game, another much-deserved loss.
