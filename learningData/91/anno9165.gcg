#note 13M PRY 32; saw of course, just didn't like putting the Y there.  K3 PYRON(E) 33 is nice except for the CG leave.  (FA)NG seems like an auto-pilot play that I'm not too fond of.  That said, happy with GYRO (over PYRO, of course).

#note I took a LOOONG time here, so I'm pretty happy to see Q agrees, even if it does leave the D open.  Nothing much else is close.

#note Held for a bit.  AGNATION, but not this.  It's ANTIGANG.  Oh well, now I know.

#note With both blanks unseen I really shoulda looked into closing down those bottom rows.  Don't know what I was thinking except, "ooh, shiny points!"

#note Yep.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIIRSTW 5E WAT +37 424
#note I figured I'd best take this place to stop another bingo from coming down.  Plus, +7 points are nice.

#note I saw PISO and passed it up.  I had him tracked and still didn't think to block his spot.  Big oops.  Two or three of 'em in this game.  At least they didn't hurt too much.
