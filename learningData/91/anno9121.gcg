>Geoff: EEILMTU 7A EMU +13 13
#note Not sure why I played this at 7A; 9A seems a little more sensible at first glance. But 7A actually sims best by 3-4 points. Can't really figure out why, and the sim details don't really say much beyond 7A being a hair more offensive.

>Geoff: FINOPRU 3B FOP +33 226
#note Thought of FINO 15A and OUPH A1, but for some reason not UPON 3A, which I might have played instead. In a short sim, UPON is on top, with FOP half a point back.

>Geoff: ?AERTTY L8 YATTERe. +80 387
#note Briefly considered ENTREATY for 70, sacrificing points for D, but decided 10 points was too much. Didn't see TERAbYT(E), though if I had looked a little longer I think I would have. YATTERED and TERABYTE sim equally well.
>Jesse: ABDDE 8J DA.BED +39 258
>Geoff: CHILORU N5 CHI.L +18 405
#note Wanted to muck up the N and O columns more than anything. I considered URCHIN N10, but it doesn't block those lines. Kind of a lot of equity to sacrifice for the cause, though.
>Jesse: EINOPST 3F PINTOES +73 331
#note Misscored as 74. I've got to start checking more closely.

#note Didn't want to empty the bag with UBIQUE. QU is fine on this board...
