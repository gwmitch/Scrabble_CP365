#note missed BORDELS, chickened out on BORKED, Couldn't find a good S word under BOXING (missed SORBED and didn't know DESORB).  Bottom line, this play could have been a lot better.

#note  too busy trying to be cute setting up my O and D.  Turns out she didn't know the O hook.

#note didn't know GALOP, but probably wouldn't have played it anyway.  I wanted to keep the QA together.  If I draw a T, QAT plays at 4A.  I I draw an I, QA(D)I plays @ D3.  And then there's the fantasy draw of DI to play parallel up there.

#note  This play is all about control.  Being up 100, I don't need to open up ridiculous lines.  I figure, close down the good stuff, make her open it, and she will probably give me things to work with.  Q likes (ZA)G here, but I hate that play so much.  If you think differently, go ahead and leave some comments.  I want to hear what you have to say.
