>Jeremy_Cahnmann: BGIR 11E BRIG +25 73
>Jason: AEINOOY 12B NAOI +12 32
#note Not playing (G)OOEY's an embarrassing miss. I looked from the G ... just a goofy vowel-consonant pattern I missed. Maybe frustration played a role, I dunno.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: AAAAAAA -AAAAA +0 73
>Jason: AEINOTY 13B AYIN +33 65
#note On the bright side, if I'd played GOOEY, my rack here would've been AAIINNT. "Oh, that's cute," Jeremy said of my play, which harkened back to our quad (with Stegman and Le) in Albany. Jeremy called a couple of CeLe's plays "cute" and I asked if flirting was considered coffeehousing/if O'Laughlin should be called over. :)
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: EMS 8A MES..... +57 130
#note And Jeremy wins the race to the spot.
>Jason: ADELORT C1 LEOTARD. +72 137
#note "Some of us have to bingo for our high scores," I said.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: AEGGHT 1B G.EG +7 137
#note Jeremy picked up HA(L)T in that spot. Obviously trying to cash in along row 14.
>Jason: DNNRTTV 5B R.ND +10 147
#note I need to start exchanging more. Even throwing it all back is seven-some points better.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: EHT 14A THE +30 167
#note Interesting that he didn't play it the turn before.
>Jason: EMNTTVW -MTVW +0 147
#note Best equity-wise, but Q doesn't put it in the top 10.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: ABDEIJZ -ABDE +0 167
#note "So, you call?" I joked after he said he was passing four, making a poker reference. "Yeah, I always like when my opponent passes when I'm thinking about it," he said.
>Jason: EEFNORT 12H OFTENER +76 223
#note "Who needs power tiles?" I asked.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: ?AHLRSS 15C SLASHeR +87 254
#note Pulled a page out of Knapp's book here. As I tracked them, I said "ESS! ESS! BLANK!" Hey, I don't whine. :)
>Jason: ACIKPWX 14H WAX +35 258
#note Chickened out on PICKAX(E). Didn't know WICKAP(E). Didn't think he'd buy WAXPICK for a zillion.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: BLUY N10 BU.LY +32 286
#note We should've put money on the best Hartsman word. Sadly, this probably would've won.
>Jason: CEIKMOP O7 COKE +34 292
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: ?AFILOS K6 FOLIAt.S +70 356
#note FOcALISE is a double-double. He'll regret this bingo choice right about...
>Jason: EIIMPTZ J10 ZI. +64 356
#note ...now. However, it's not my best play. I missed (O)PTIMIZE! "You're in trouble now," I say. "It's a tie game and you don't have any blanks or S's to bail your ass out." While in the bag, I ask: "Who has the worse endgame?" Each of us said we did. It was about this time I saw my track was off for the first time in the tourney. (A couple turns later it was fixed.)
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: AAIIJRT -AAI +0 356
#note Odd exchange. I hate giving up a crack the board in an "outrunning" situation like this unless it's necessary. His rack couldn't have been that bad; he only passed three.
>Jason: AEIMPTW 4A PA.E +24 380
#note I knew this play sucked, but I couldn't find anything better. Any play you might find is almost certainly better. Trying to set up M(O)W at 3B cheaply.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: DEIJNO J2 JOINED +42 398
>Jason: IIMNOTW 2J .OINT +24 404
#note I hated this play, too, but again, I couldn't find anything better. But since ADU's in the bag, it's going to be a long shot to win no matter what I do. I came back early from lunch and re-played a few different scenarios, not winning any. I then concluded even if I found a win now, I would've been way over time.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: AEPRTUV 1L PEAR +38 436
#note V(I)RTU's 13 better, setting up the guaranteed out.
>Jason: ADIMUW I3 MAID +28 432
#note Sam K. saw me playing it out, and when I showed him what actually happened, he said MAUD's obviously better here, although on this board it doesn't matter. I don't heed the "find your best play, find a better one" advice enough, although in my defense I was short on time. BTW, MIA(O)W sets up a guaranteed out and is two better.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: TUV E1 .UV +7 443
#note VU(M)'s one better.
>Jason: UW K2 .W +13 445
#note Best, as now he wins by the amount he gets for the T.
>Jeremy_Cahnmann: T 6I ...T +8 451
>Jeremy_Cahnmann:  (U) +2 453
