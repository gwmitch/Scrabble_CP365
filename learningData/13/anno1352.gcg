#note I decided here that I liked the scoring enough in spite of the horrid rack leave (TUUV); I didn't see UVULA into the A which scores only 5 fewer points and has a much better rack leave. That could very well be a theme for this tournament.

#note If I'd seen the line through the N of YENTE, I might have found PALADINS. I'm not sure. I didn't see the line, though, until two turns later, and it was too late.

#note ...and here's where I lost the game. Because I only saw the one spot to put the K (into the A of ATTIRE), I figured that my only chance was to K-stick. Had I seen the other spot, I definitely wouldn't have played DoNA. I doubt that I would have found the win here, because I don't know ULAMA, I would have been able to lose by fewer points.
>Nedd_Kareiva: DKOO 13H DO. +11 391
#note Because he didn't immediately drop the K, I still didn't see MOSK.
>Andy_Saunders: ?BIN 2F BIN +25 370
#note Of course, I still think I can K-stick, and decided to try to maximize score here instead of just going out. I was also severely low on time and not thinking straight at this point. Immediately after hitting the clock, I realize that I've given Nedd a pair of spots to put the K...
>Nedd_Kareiva: KO F10 ...K +10 401
#note ...and he takes the spot that I should have seen two turns ago.
