>Opponent: ABO 8F ABO +10 10
>Rebecca: DEKTUUX 9G EX +24 24
#note Quackle likes F8 (A)UK 17 or F7 E(A)UX 27.  I was distracted by the UU and hoping I'd have a spot to play KUDU on my next turn.
>Opponent: ADFLORT -ADF +0 10
>Rebecca: DEKTTUU 10D DUKE +24 48
#note Sims about equally to 10B TUTUED 17.
>Opponent: EI D10 .IE +8 18
>Rebecca: ABESTTU 11C B.T +14 62
#note Even not knowing BATTUES or (EX)TUBATES, this is a bad move.  I was trying to make it harder for him to bingo through the E on 12D.
>Opponent: AD C11 .AD +14 32
>Rebecca: AEELSTU 7H LUTE +15 77
#note I should not have missed ELUATES.
>Opponent: AEINOST B9 ATONIES +80 112
>Rebecca: AAENOOS A6 AEON +14 91
#note ANOA is better.
>Opponent: IU J7 .UI +3 115
>Rebecca: AAEHOSZ B2 HAZES +42 133
#note Quackle likes AHA or HAO or HAE on A13.  I'd rather take the points.
>Opponent: NOO 4B .OON +26 141
>Rebecca: ACELOWY A1 WAY +37 170
#note Why is 3A Y(A)W or W(A)Y better?!
>Opponent: ?CISSTU K1 CUrTSI.S +70 211
>Rebecca: ?CEELMO 5D wELCOME. +77 247
>Opponent: JO 4H JO +38 249
>Rebecca: DFGINPR 2J D.PING +28 275
#note Missing 2J F(U)NGI 34.
>Opponent: HIV 15B .HIV +11 260
>Rebecca: AFFORTY 3D YAFF +25 300
#note Didn't know 4K (T)OFFY 36 and didn't see (T)AFFY.  Lots of other places for more scoring too.
>Opponent: RRR -RRR +0 260
>Rebecca: EELORTW 2E WOE +27 327
#note Quackle likes C7 LOW 21, which I didn't like, or F12 LOWE 26, but I didn't know the hook on SHIV.
>Opponent: DIM 1G DIM +25 285
>Rebecca: ELRRRTT -LRRTT +0 327
#note F7 LARK 18 is best.  M1 R(I)TTER turns over two R's.  I didn't notice that all the R's were still out, and I couldn't find places to score.  I kept the ER hoping for (SHIV)ERER or (SHIV)ERED (I was behind on tracking and hadn't crossed out the last D).
>Opponent: IN 4K .IN +6 291
>Rebecca: EGLQRRR 1M Q +11 338
#note Quackle says to exchange here, which should be obvious, but I talked myself out of it because I had exchanged on the turn before.
>Opponent: AL 5M AL +4 295
>Rebecca: EGLPRRR O4 PER +11 349
#note Missing 9E PR(EX) 25 and P(A)R(K) and L(A)R(K) on F7.  I was too set on blocking this column instead of scoring.
>Opponent: AEGINRR 11G REARING +72 367
>Rebecca: GLRRRTV K10 V.G +7 356
#note Still missing F7 L(A)R(K) or T(A)L(K).
>Opponent: T 7O T +6 373
>Opponent:  (RRRTL) +10 383
