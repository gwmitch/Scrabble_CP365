>George_Viebranz: ELOPQST 7E Q +11 11
#note Thought this was a no-brainer, dump the Q and get on with it.  QOP(H) D5 is more points and a much better leave, I'm surprised Quackle only puts it .3 ahead of Q(I).
>Virtual_Balboa: ?IILTUV H1 dILUTIV. +83 107
>George_Viebranz: ELOPRST 5E PLO.TERS +90 101
#note Best for obvious reasons.

#note Missed some good ones here, the best being I(R)IS F7.

#note Yay! Best again!
>Virtual_Balboa: ADEORST 12F RED.OATS +76 241
>George_Viebranz: ?AEEJTX 14F JET. +27 198
#note 7th best.  Top play is JE(U)X 10G.  Worth more and better leave.

>George_Viebranz: ?AEIORX 15G XI +42 240
#note I am excited to see what everyone thinks here.  Before you get too far, know that I missed EXORdIA(L) 3A.  I knew EXORdIA would go down, but on a wide open board like this, I want to take the 42 for XI.  I'm confident I can bingo on this next turn with this open board and drawing to AEOR?.  What do you think?  Take the bingo now or gamble?  Turns out I missed the best non-bingo anyway, IXORA 15D.
>Virtual_Balboa: AEGNOOU 1L .OGA +24 295
>George_Viebranz: ?AENORR 1A RANcORE. +68 308
#note I was guessing on this word, but now that I know it's good, I think I may have played it before.  This is probably the least valuable bingo possible to land on a TWS.  Missed (A)uROREAN O1 and NARROwED 1A (3 more points than mine) 
>Virtual_Balboa: AEINNOU N7 UNION +20 315
>George_Viebranz: BCDNOTY O7 TODY +47 355
#note Second to TOBY in the same spot for 4 more.  Dammit! Dammit!
>Virtual_Balboa: AAAEFMM 15L F.ME +39 354
>George_Viebranz: BCEENPR 10H P.B +13 368
#note I was way off with this one.  Didn't see (Z)EB(E)C J2, don't know BEC(A)P K9.  
>Virtual_Balboa: AAALMUW D8 .AWALA +24 378
>George_Viebranz: ACEENOR E10 OE +13 381
#note Probably where I blew it.  CANOE 4B is beautiful.  Scores 7 more than mine and forces VB to empty the bag, which appears to be full of hurl and lung butter.  I was thinking I could bingo again, and it's Daniel Milton revisited.  Take a smart play over a ghost of a chance to bingo.  
>Virtual_Balboa: DFGKMUW K11 G.WK +24 402
>George_Viebranz: ACDENNR 13C N.NA +18 399
#note Quackle says fish.  Best play is (WO)N 10D.
>Virtual_Balboa: ADEFMUV O12 FUM. +13 415
>George_Viebranz: CDEIR B1 .CRID +16 415
#note Best play, but I've already lost.  VB has two outs, and I give it a better one.
