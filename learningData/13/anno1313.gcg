>Sam_Rosin: ABGJNOW 8D BANJO +34 34
>Jason: DDEEIRV 7H DERIVED +67 67
#note Once got away with REDIVING* when DERIVING would've played. That taught me that rack, obviously.
>Sam_Rosin: AEGHOWY 8M HOY +35 69
>Jason: EILMNOO 9E LOOM +27 94
>Sam_Rosin: AEGIOUW 10E AWE +41 110
#note Who needs bingoes? As I joked to Sam later, "If I'd known your racks were so bad early, I wouldn't have been so worried."
>Jason: AAEIINT L6 A.A +18 112
#note Q seems to like (V)AIN in the same spot.
>Sam_Rosin: CGIIOPU J6 G.OUP +18 128
>Jason: AEIINST 11I ISATINE +73 185
>Sam_Rosin: ACEGIIX 12K XI +31 159
#note As I suspected, Q likes AGE or CAGE along row 7 (Sam's next play) because it sets up a huge X play that's almost unblockable. But this is a close third.
>Jason: ?ILOTTY 13L TOY +15 200
#note I'm trying to stop something like QUEEN for 60-some the rate Sam's going, but I see I set up QUIRE for 70-some instead. Genius, just genius.
>Sam_Rosin: AACEEGI 7D AGE +20 179
>Jason: ?DILNRT O10 L.D +6 206
#note I had four games this tournament (Shreve, Rosin, Armstrong, Hartsman) where I had four-, five-turn stretches where I couldn't draw a vowel to save my mortal soul. I know we're consonant-heavy at this point, but my next few racks got frustrating.
>Sam_Rosin: ACEGIUV C3 UVEIC +36 215
#note I thought for sure this was good.
>Jason: ?INNRTZ 6B Z.N +37 243
#note I mean, I knew it was no good, but it gave me a nice play to play off the NZ that I drew. Yeah.
>Sam_Rosin: ABGHIST 14M HAG +29 244
#note Sam shuffles, laughs, pokes Jon Shreve (playing Cahnmann). "Nice rack," Jon says. "You'd like this word, Jeremy," Sam says. Feeling left out, Sam says he'll tell me when he plays off all his tiles. "Will that be soon?" I ask. :) P.S. Since when does GALA take the H back hook and why didn't anyone tell me? Thank goodness Sam missed it, too. Not a huge mistake, though.
>Jason: ?INNRTT 3B T.RN +4 247
#note OK, Tile Gods, not happy with me playing two consonants at a time? I'll play three, then! (When I noticed I missed INTRaNT and N(U)TRIeNT, I apologized.)
>Sam_Rosin: BEILMST N13 ..M +8 252
>Jason: ?ADEINT 12C sTAINED +69 316
#note After his blocky fish, 69's the best I can do.
>Sam_Rosin: ?BEILST 4E aSTILBE +60 312
#note Sam then tells me the rack in question was SHITBAG. "And you thought Jeremy would like that word?" I asked. "You see what your reputation is? Doesn't that bother you?" I asked Jeremy, knowing the answer.
>Jason: EINQSUW L1 WINS +40 356
#note I thought this took the S (remembered seeing it as a spelling bee word on ESPN), but I had to re-think my position a while. In the end, I was confident enough.
>Sam_Rosin: EEFOPRR -  +0 312
#note He's obligated to challenge (and lament not playing ALBITES).
>Jason: EEKQRUU 2J QU.RE +68 424
#note I hit one of the three R's I was hoping for.
>Sam_Rosin: EEFOPRR O1 PROF +54 366
#note I was too busy berating myself for making the "wrong" decision on QUIRE v. QUIRK (Q agreed with me) that I didn't bother noticing that I don't know QUIRER*. Monday, I say to him: "I meant to tell you, QUIRER*'s phony." He replies: "Yeah, I know. Doug Brockmeier challenged it off when I played it yesterday." It was a game he lost by 40-some, too. Oops. I say if he doesn't hit 1800 here, I'll take the heat.
>Jason: EFKLSTU H1 KUF. +33 457
#note I drew the S, just in case there was any doubt about who outdrew who. (And if there was, it should be extinguished after seeing Sam's dreck racks. No doubt if our draws are reversed, he wins by a lot more than I did.)
