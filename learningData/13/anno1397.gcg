>Dallas: AEEGIIO -AEGIIO +0 0
#note Best thing I could've done.  The duck is with me on this one.
>Christopher_Sheppard: ADDNY 8H DANDY +28 28
>Dallas: AEEETUZ 7I ZEE +48 48
#note Best again.
>Christopher_Sheppard: EGR 9G REG +25 53
>Dallas: AEEITTU 6K TUI +7 55
#note Quackle prefers ETUI at 9L, but there is no way I'm hanging an I in the 3x3.  I saw and rejected that option.
>Christopher_Sheppard: MU K4 MU... +16 69
>Dallas: AEEEFOT -EEFO +0 55
#note Quackle hates my exchange here, and I'm sure the duck is right.  But, guess who bingoes next turn?
>Christopher_Sheppard: EORW L1 WORE +30 99
>Dallas: AENOPRT 10A PRONATE +65 120
#note . . . if you said me, you made the right call!  I know, I know.  I hung a P in the 3x3, but that's not bad like an I, it's my only bingo, and he just hung a W out there anyway, so I can come back and answer whatever he does . . .
>Christopher_Sheppard: AACINST A8 CA.TAINS +167 266
#note . . . except that.  CRAP!!!
>Dallas: BEHIKNX 1L .INK +33 153
#note And so, I begin a slow charge to try and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Can I do it?  Stay tuned.  FYI, I intentionally took the 3x play instead of the higher scoring HEX overlap, because I didn't want to give him the softball points up top.
>Christopher_Sheppard: EO 9L OE +8 274
#note Ah, he's fishing.  This could be helpful.
>Dallas: BEFHILX 11C HEX +51 204
#note Now, I'll take the HEX play.  Of course, now, the duck prefers BIFLEX at 11E.  But I may be very glad with my choice on my next turn.
>Christopher_Sheppard: BEG 12D BEG +32 306
>Dallas: BEFILOS 11G FOIBLES +80 284
#note Ha!  I close to within 22, after being down 146 after the 3x3.  I may have a chance afterall.  This was a funny turn.  I was looking at playing BEFOILS* as a desperation bingo attempt, because I knew I needed to bingo, and soon.  I looked for a place to play it on the board, then looked back down at my rack, and FOIBLES jumped out at me.  Whew!
>Christopher_Sheppard: UV K11 .UV +6 312
>Dallas: ?EILNQW 5M Q +11 295
#note Quackle confuses me here.  It likes QI at 5M, which I specifically chose not to do to avoid the big S hook in the 3X column.  Was this wrong?  Sure doesn't seem so to me.  But, then it says M5 Q(I) is second best, and what I did 5M Q is worst.  It's the same play!!!  Maybe it's something about the way I entered the play.  At any rate, I stick by my decision here.
>Christopher_Sheppard: DU 8A .UD +6 318
>Dallas: ?EHILNW 2J WH. +17 312
#note O.K., so maybe I should've exchanged last turn.  Still, he's fishing, and I'm building points and racks, so I like my chances.
>Christopher_Sheppard: EI 13K .IE +12 330
>Dallas: ?EILMNS D2 MErLINS +76 388
#note And there it is - I come back from 146 down to take a 58 point lead.  Now he really needs that bingo he's been fishing for, and I am shifting to shut down mode.  As to (K)rEMLINS, who knew?  Certainly not me.
>Christopher_Sheppard: IJT 5B JI.T +22 352
>Dallas: AILOTVY 3C L.VITY +26 414
#note Quackle didn't like this play, but it got rid of clunky tiles and effectively shut down the top half of the board, except for playing through the I and pluralizing JILT.
>Christopher_Sheppard: LP H1 PL. +24 376
>Dallas: AAADFGO 15A .OFA +8 422
#note I could use some advice on this play.  I thought (S)OFA was good, because it closed off the 3x possibility, and limited the bingo possibilities a little.  If you were me, what would you have done here?
>Christopher_Sheppard: OR N1 .OR +6 382
#note He's trying to open lines, and I'm convinced he has the last blank.
>Dallas: AAADGOS 6K ...S +6 428
#note Quackle hates my play here, too.  But, I think I probably blocked a bingo off of that R.  Maybe I shouldn't have worried about it, but I was very worried, and I thought it better to block his set up than the line above the A which I put down.  DONA at 13E was a better scoring block, though.
>Christopher_Sheppard: OR 7N OR +4 386
>Dallas: AAADGNO 14D AG +5 433
#note He opens a second line for himself again, and now I know for sure that his rack is TACRInE, which obviously plays above the A in SOFA (among others).  I look to see if I'm dead, but I can't find any plays from the R, so I decide to block the A overlap, and take my chances.
>Christopher_Sheppard: ?ACEIRT O7 .EACToR +24 410
#note As usual, Chris played very fast, so he had about 17 minutes left at this point in the game.  He spent a solid 10 minutes looking for a bingo, but found nothing (sim shows there was no bingo).  And the game is mine!
