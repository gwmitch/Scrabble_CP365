#note I didn't wear a blue wig this game, I swear. There are definitely some fishes here that score a lot more than 4 points.

#note cOVETING in the same spot takes away the possibility of an X bomb.

#note I have my rack written down on my scoresheet as ARRAYIS. Why I missed dISARRAY I'll never know.
>Lynda_Finn: ELX B4 LEX +52 191
>Andy_Saunders: DEIPRSV 3A VIPER +31 203
#note Quackle likes VESPID for 53 along the bottom; it's certainly a risk leaving the S-hook open for the double word score going both ways, especially with 2 S's still out there, but I do have an S in my leave; meaning, Lynda only has one shot at the hook.
>Lynda_Finn: TW L2 T.W +22 213
>Andy_Saunders: AADJLOS 2B SODA +43 246
#note Quackle thinks that it's a tossup between SODA and SOJA at 1L. I like SODA because it takes away the consistently higher-scoring space. Plus, I keep the J on my rack for the hook along the top.
>Lynda_Finn: ITU 1E TUI +6 219
#note I wonder if Lynda figured out that I'd been leaving hooks for myself; in any case, it keeps me from scoring big with the J.
>Andy_Saunders: AACGIJL D2 ..CAL +16 262
#note 2J ACTA scores here and takes away a great number of scoring chances on the top right triple.
>Lynda_Finn: EIOU M9 .OUIE +10 229

#note More numptiness. Missed a pair of high-scoring bingos playing parallel to QATS (MAdEIRA and uRAEMIA).
