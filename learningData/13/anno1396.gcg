>Andy_Saunders: ACCEIJP 8G JAPE +26 26
#note I had a moment similar to JWB's "Volost" moment when Quackling here. ICECAP/IPECAC is better here; I didn't realize that those two words were actually an anagram pair. Glad I didn't learn the hardest way.
>KC_Frodyma: DINT K8 DINT +25 25
>Andy_Saunders: CCFIIOR 9F FOR +19 45
#note I don't know why I didn't play FICO here. I saw FICO. Why I thought CCII was a good lead I'll never know.
>KC_Frodyma: EIL I6 LI.E +16 41
>Andy_Saunders: ?CCIIQU 11K .IC +5 50
#note Quackle doesn't have a problem with this fish.
>KC_Frodyma: EFRT 10D FRET +26 67
>Andy_Saunders: ?ACGIQU D10 .IG +14 64
#note Quackle does with this one, though, if only because I missed CALQUING (CALQUE can be a verb? news to me!)
>KC_Frodyma: LMOY 6F MOL.Y +24 91
>Andy_Saunders: ??ACOQU M11 .OCA +16 80
#note COEQUAL 5A is of course the bingo here; COCA sets me up for a possible monster Q play/blank split, though.
>KC_Frodyma: ATU 11F TAU +20 111
>Andy_Saunders: ??LNQRU 14J QUe.N +66 146
#note Scored as 68.
>KC_Frodyma: ABIN 15G BANI +29 140
>Andy_Saunders: ?EEELNR 5E NE +8 154
#note Better fishes here that drop a 2nd E.
>KC_Frodyma: DEOS O12 DOSE +35 175
>Andy_Saunders: ?EEILMR 4F MEaLIER +73 227
>KC_Frodyma: AEKW D3 WEAK +25 200
>Andy_Saunders: AAHLOTW C2 HOWL +39 266
#note 2B LOTAH is significantly better here. Maybe if I knew all of my 5s cold, I'd see this one.
>KC_Frodyma: EGN 3K NEG +12 212
>Andy_Saunders: AAHRSST B1 RAH +31 297
#note Here I start to overvalue my duplicate S's. Plenty of spots to score here while dropping an S off.
>KC_Frodyma: EGY 5K GEY +25 237
>Andy_Saunders: ADDSSTZ A1 ADS +35 332
#note Playing off both D's here for ADDS and 45 is best.
>KC_Frodyma: AIR H1 RAI. +9 246
>Andy_Saunders: ADENSTZ 14F ZA +35 367
>KC_Frodyma: EIOOSTV 12B VO.IE +16 262

>KC_Frodyma: OPRTTUV A6 PUTTO +24 286
>Andy_Saunders: BINOSSX 13A S.X +38 431
#note, Well, KC only has one spot to put the V. I fail to block it. I saw the big X play and figured I should play it. Considering the play, there are many jokes that could be made. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to come up with some good ones.
