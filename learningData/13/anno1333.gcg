#note Quackle wants to play WEEP but it didn't seem worth it.

#note Didn't see D9 FOR(K) 20 which is obviously better.
>Joel_H.: HP F7 P.H +17 143
>Brad_W.: FJOPQRV D4 PR.F +26 99
#note Thought about trading but decided to take the points.  10A FJOR(D) 32 is probably better even though it spends my only vowel.
>Joel_H.: ?EEGLST I2 GELaTES +67 210
>Brad_W.: EIJNOQV 2F JIN.O +31 130
#note Setting up a nice Q play if I can draw an I.
>Joel_H.: AEGIMR 1J GAMIER +39 249
>Brad_W.: AEEEEQV 4I .EVEE +16 146
#note No I's but three more E's.  Lovely.
>Joel_H.: GL M3 L.G +8 257
>Brad_W.: AAEENQT 6G QA. +12 158
#note Still no I even though there are 7 unseen.  Time to dump the Q.  I hated this play but I couldn't keep the Q forever.  Missed C11 T(R)ANQ 28.  This is probably my most missed word.
>Joel_H.: ALOSTUW N5 OUTLAWS +73 330
>Brad_W.: AEENRTX O8 AXE +50 208
#note Missed B9 EXT(E)RNE 68 which is inexcusable since it's practically on my rack already.  Didn't look over there I guess.  8K EXA(L)T 60 is also better.
>Joel_H.: EHLW B10 WH.EL +44 374

#note I saw M9 REI 23 but decided not to gum things up over there.

#note OK he has the last S.
>Brad_W.: BEINRTU 10J BUT +18 259
#note Not sure why I'm fishing, I know the pond is empty, but I don't know what else to do.  10J BUN 18 is better.  9D B(AH) 18 is a good fish if there was such a thing on this board.
>Joel_H.: ANY 13L ANY +16 421
>Brad_W.: EIINORT 3E ION +19 278
#note 14N OI 14 is an interesting play.  Forces him to use his S now, or perhaps make a blocking play.
>Joel_H.: Y F2 ..Y +13 434
>Brad_W.: CEIRTTU -  +0 278
#note This is where I self destructed.  I can accept the fact that I was getting mauled, but I was now 1:30 over on time and I just wanted the game to be over.  But part of me wanted to keep him from bingoing out.  So I looked couldn't figure out how to block with 1 in the bag.  So I passed.
>Joel_H.: I L1 .I +4 438
>Brad_W.: CEIRTTU K3 E.ICT +20 298
#note OK, now I know exactly what he has.  All I have to do is block his out bingo to regain some of my sanity.  I spent 3 more minutes looking for the block and couldn't find one.  After the game, I realized that every single letter I hang in row 15, he can play an 8 through.  Finally, as my clock approached -5:00 I said fuck it.
>Joel_H.: ADEINST 14F DETAINS +69 507
#note I lost 50 points on time.  Also, Quackle showed me the block I could not find: I11 I(C)E 6.  I considered the play but I knew he had 6 possible bingos, and he had 2 of the hook letters (D and S), and didn't consider the fact that none of the 6 bingos put the S or D in the 5th or 6th position.  Oh well.
