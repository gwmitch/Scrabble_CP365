#note  The moral of the story here is, that if you are sitting on a bingo (especially a really cool one like INDOCIL(E)) and someone blocks your play with a word you aren't a bazillion percent sure of, at least hold.  For your own sanity, at least hold.  The funny thing is, that I knew 100% that this word wasn't good, but didn't even think about it in the game.  AEISPRR has a bunch of anagrams, but PAIRERS* is NOT one of them.  ugh.
