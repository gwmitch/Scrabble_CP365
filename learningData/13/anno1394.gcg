#note Quackle likes SIXTHLY here.
>Melissa_Routzahn: CCIIV 6E CIVIC +28 40
>Andy_Saunders: AAEFSTX J2 FAXES +40 62
#note Pretty much any of the plays dropping FAX for 30+, holding onto EAST, are best here. I really look like I'm under-valuing the EAST leave.
>Melissa_Routzahn: DEJP 3I J.PED +46 86
>Andy_Saunders: ADERTTT L2 T.T +6 68
#note There's a bingo here. TET is the best non-bingo here. Hint: Try looking through the two Is.

#note Now here's a bingo that I should have found; I need to get better at finding words like this.

>Melissa_Routzahn: OW 2L .OW +15 213
#note Scored as 18.
>Andy_Saunders: EINOTUW 1N OW +20 230
#note Another play that I want back; I completely missed the N-hook possibility. I saw UNWET immediately when Quackling this position. ENOW is even better, but this was definitely a missed possibility.
>Melissa_Routzahn: EGNRSUZ J8 .RG +8 221
>Andy_Saunders: EILNRTU 10H LU. +4 234
#note Quackle likes moving 6 tiles for 20-odd here, but I'm not quite sure I agree. Opponent's last move was an obvious fish, but I'm not quite sure what the best block here is (or even if I should block).
>Melissa_Routzahn: ?ENOORS 11I SOONERs +69 290
>Andy_Saunders: EINNRST M8 INT.RNES +68 302
#note Unfortunately, there are no bingos on any other line.
>Melissa_Routzahn: AEGOTUZ O4 OUTGAZE. +104 394
#note This one puts her out of reach, I'm not 100% sure of the word, so...
>Andy_Saunders: ABEEHMN -  +0 302
#note ...I give her the chance to play out with the S and blank that I manged to miss on my post-bingo draw.
