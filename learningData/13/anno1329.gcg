#note This is a pretty terrible play.  There were plenty of better places to dump similar tiles, but NEW@5K=28[u?] is best.

#note  not that it's a terrible easy find, but I missed (S)TRENgTH

#note  watch as I miss a pretty basic play.
>Brett_H: ?AENRTY I6 AY +24 335
#note  I took note of the YCLAD hood when she played it, but once I got the Y I was so worried about balancing my rack for a bingo that I spaced on TRAY/ARTY@A1=48[EN?].  Also on this board there are 2 playable bingoes of (P)EdANTRY and (S)TERNwAY.  TRAY is still the stronger play by far.
