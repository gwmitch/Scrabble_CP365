>Matthew: CMOORSV 8D VROOM +28 28
#note (-6.6) Yikes... the 8H position is that much better? I thought the obvious play would avoid the -ING snapback.
>Jeremy: ?EORTUY 7G TUtOYER +68 68
>Matthew: CDDLNSU 6H CUD +25 53
#note (-6.3) Idiotic to miss CUDDL(Y), especially considering I was looking at (and chickening out on) CUDD(Y).
>Jeremy: EKLLOUV E4 LOUV.E +18 86
#note (-16.2) LEKU and LEVO for the points.
>Matthew: DELNOPS L3 ELOP.D +22 75
#note (-9.4) LODENS. Takes board vision to see that. Also, a bunch of plays that hook LOUVRE-D... which I don't know.
>Jeremy: AKLNNOY M1 ONLAY +27 113
#note (-6.6) KNOLLY
>Matthew: AEENOSS 4B ENO.ASES +68 143
#note (-6.0) Even after agonizing for several seconds over which bingo to play, I pick the wrong one. RESEASON is better for some reason. Why?
>Jeremy: AIKMNPR 1L P.RK +39 152
>Matthew: ACFINRW 3A CRAW +29 172
#note (-7.3) WIF(E). I was playing too defensively.
>Jeremy: AIIMNNT H1 MIN. +18 170
#note (15.3) INTIMA 2B would have been nice.
>Matthew: AFIIINS 2B IF +22 194
#note Holy crap I made the right move.
>Jeremy: AAEIJNT K3 TAJ +52 222
>Matthew: AIILNST 3F LI. +9 203
#note And again!
>Jeremy: AEEINNT 8L .ENI +17 239
>Matthew: AIINSTU -IUI +0 203
#note (-6.0) ex. UI is correct. Even as I was doing it, I knew I was being stupid. I just have this phobia where I believe every I on my rack will draw into another one.
>Jeremy: AEGINST 10E SEATING +72 311
>Matthew: AAEGNST H10 .AG +6 209
#note Actually a decent play. Close to GAG for the top play.
>Jeremy: AEEHRTU 12H .HAUT +18 329
#note (-10.2) (RE)HEATER is nice points.
>Matthew: ADEINST O6 DA.NTIES +60 269
#note (-7.9) (IRE)D is the best play, for some reason... why? As far as I can tell, my best chance is to bingo, and then luckbox another bingo out of the bag. That's why I took so few points to set up the DAINTIES(T) bingo line.
>Jeremy: AEEGHIR H10 ...GER +24 353
>Matthew: DEEFIRT 14K REFIT +26 295
#note This play gives up, but scores the most.
>Jeremy: EZ 14F ZE. +32 385
>Matthew: ?BBDEQW 9I Qi +42 337
>Jeremy: AHIIOX 15C IXIA +30 415
>Matthew: BBDEW 14A WEB +20 357
>Jeremy: HO 13M OH. +27 442
>Jeremy:  (BD) +10 452
