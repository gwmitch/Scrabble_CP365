>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ABCDDDF -ABCDDDF +0 0
#note Q seems to like keeping ACD. I seem to like turnover.
>Jason: IJMNSTW 8G JIN +20 20
#note I seem to have gone from exchanging too much to not exchanging enough. Q likes keeping INST.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAEGITT 7I AGITATE +63 63
>Jason: CMRRSTW O5 CR.W +27 47
#note I was just hoping for a spot to play CWM. Thanks for the E, Kate.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DEGMOSU F6 MUD +24 87
>Jason: EIMPRST 4I PERMITS +85 132
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DEEEGOS 9G ODE +23 110
>Jason: EEHILSU 3L UH +24 156
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EEFGLSV 10E VEG +20 130
>Jason: EEIILNS E9 E.IL +14 170
#note As soon as I hit my clock, I thought "You know, the pool's vowel-heavy enough VIE's probably better." Q agrees.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEFLSSU 12B FUL. +14 144
>Jason: EEINOSU -EOU +0 170
#note FEU is better; I was needlessly worried about Kate whacking me across row 15.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEOOSST 9K TOEAS +17 161
#note Missing OSTEO(M)AS at 6A. I know I never considered it a bingo lane. I could tell she was frustrated as she picked up STOAE/(JOG)S to play TOEAS.
>Jason: ?EINNST 11G STaNINE +74 244
#note For style points, play E(I)NSTeIN at 11D (took way too much board vision for me) or the inferior nines (I)N(T)ENSITy, (I)N(T)ErNIST and (I)N(T)ESTINe. (Note that OSTEOMAS gives me a trip-trip coming back.)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DGOPRRS 2J GORPS +37 198
#note Missing PRODR(U)GS, a word I learned from Jeff Fiszbein (a pharmacist) on the ride up. I'd call that a funny story, but I'm pretty sure Kate wouldn't laugh, just like she wasn't laughing about drawing five consonants after a vowel dump.
>Jason: ADHIOTV 1H ODAH +32 276
#note Thought about VITA to be defensive but concluded it was a little too early for that.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ?DNNRYZ I11 .DZ +22 220
#note Q likes RYND at 2E, but I think this is the play. With three lines open, my plan is to just outrun the bingo.
>Jason: AIIOTVX 12K TAXI +37 313
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ?AENNRY 2B ANNoYER +86 306
#note Hey, how'd she draw two vowels? :) And when I planned on outrunning the bingo, I didn't expect it to be 86!
>Jason: AEILOQV C11 Q.AI +26 339
#note Perhaps a little risky with an L unseen, but I'd rather do that the put the L in the triple lane. Q agrees.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: BEFIIOO 1A OBI +21 327
#note Most of our post-mortem focused on what Kate should do here. I don't think either of us saw the best play, OBOE at 1A.
>Jason: CEKLORV 15A RELOCK +53 392
#note Should play LOCKER to make row 14 bingoes harder. Didn't want to set up a cheap UNLOCKER, but it's no good anyway.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAEFINO 9D F. +5 332
#note Fishing for the L that I've just drawn.
>Jason: BELOUVY 14H BEVY +33 425
#note Given the unseen pool, I probably don't have to block. Better safe than sorry, though.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAEINOR 8A NAOI +21 353
#note Scored as 20.
>Jason: ELOUW 6F .EOW +16 441
#note Put down at OWE at 3F before realizing that made EW*. This is best. I know it's what CeLe would've done. :)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AER 3F ARE +15 368
#note "15, and those are all valid words," she said. Har har. This is why I count each word separately, to double check stuff like that.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly:  (LU) +4 372
