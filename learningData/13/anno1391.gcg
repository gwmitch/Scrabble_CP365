>Alyssa_: AADEORR 8D ADORE +14 14
#note Alyssa: "Well, right idea, wrong word.  How about OREAD for a few points more?"
>Rod: DIINSSV I6 VID +16 16
#note Rod: "Quackle likes VIDS by the narrowest of margins (+0.2 Win%). Essentially a dead heat. I know the 2nd S isn't worth much, but it's worth more than 2. The equity loss must be balanced by not offering A-VID, a hook I still find myself semi-blind to at times."
>Alyssa_: AKNORTU 5E OUTRANK +102 116
#note Rod: "Oh yeah, *that* hook."
>Rod: BEINRSS L1 BRINS +32 48
#note Rod: "No bingos. Keep scoring, keep the board open, keep a strong leave, done."
>Alyssa_: AEFFGMT 1L .AFF +36 152
#note Rod: "Scores best and clears out the clunkiest stuff."
>Rod: EGIOPRS 3G PIROG.ES +80 128
#note Rod: "It took me a zillion attempts in cardbox to finally remember how to spell this. Thankfully I got it right here."
>Alyssa_: AEGHLMT 2J MA.GE +57 209
#note Alyssa: "Huge score."
>Rod: ?AELOST 2B gELATOS +72 200
#note Rod: "Expertly drawn, Rod. Best scoring play & strong defensive value."
>Alyssa_: HHILRTW 4A WHIRL +32 241
#note Rod: "Can't argue with this choice. Nothing else is close."
>Rod: CEOPQTY D7 Q.T +12 212
#note Rod: "Very begrudgingly played this. Thought long and hard about COP 6D or even YUP F4. But this is a very Q-unfriendly board, and I could very well end up having to exchange next turn if I hold it. I figure this way, at least I'm holding multiple P plays with P-SI in the mix and the potential for something huge up top with the right draw. I  draws hit a potential WICOPY. There are options a turn ahead with the pointy leave."
>Alyssa_: HITUXY? A4 .ITHY +42 283
#note Alyssa: "Vowel placement slightly better than WHITY."
>Rod: CEEOPWY 1H PE +27 239
#note Rod: "Meh. I'll take the points, but I'm not getting anywhere playing short. I didn't see YOWIE, but that's probably because I ruled out that type of play. I hate what it does to the board because it puts me one easy defensive play from a totally shut down board. After PE, I might not be close to bingoing, but at least the board has signs of life."
>Alyssa_: DEIUXZ? 6A .UX +12 295
#note Alyssa: "Quackle prefers the points for DOUX, F7. My TUX play simmed #1 when I entered the rack incorrectly."
>Rod: CELOTWY F7 C.WY +20 259
#note Rod: "Again, I can't score much, but I've gotta move some tiles. Same deal as last time: If I play YOWIE, I'm just hoping to win the lottery and I'm making my opp's job really easy. No thanks."
>Alyssa_: DEEIMZ? 7H D.MErIZE +73 368
#note Alyssa: "The only bingo that played."
>Rod: ADEGLOT O6 L.GATED +33 292
#note Rod: "Looked promising, but no banana. Take the points and stretch the board, maybe something can still happen."
>Alyssa_: EEEINOU -EEIOU +0 368
#note Alyssa: "Eat my vowels, Rod!  Throwing in the other E sims a little bit better."
>Rod: ABELOSV B8 ABSOLVE +83 375
#note Rod: "Caught the big break I needed. B8 scores the most and only 1 unseen tile (R) hooks it. It feels most defensive with the J unseen. If I sack 3 pts to put this at 12H, I'm just giving her a ton more choices. So I'll make her work for it and see what comes out of the bag. There's still 14 in there. Despite her exchange, they can't all be bricks, right?"
>Alyssa_: CENNORT 11H CRETONN. +70 438
#note Alyssa: "And then I pull unlikely diamonds from a bag of rocks."
>Rod: AEIIIOU 12B .OUIE +10 385
#note Rod: "And... we're done. But hey, always play out the endgame. Spread matters, and the only way to get better at endgames is to practice them. Every game has an endgame. She's threatening both CAJON H11 and JANE 1A, so blocking is futile. And look, I've found a possible out-in-2."
>Alyssa_: AEJNNOU H11 .AJON +45 483
#note Rod: "Not worth blocking my outs with this many points available."
>Rod: AII N10 I.IA +13 398
#note Rod: "Small victory for me getting these last 7 vowels on the board. Well played, Lys!"
>Rod:  (NEU) +6 404
