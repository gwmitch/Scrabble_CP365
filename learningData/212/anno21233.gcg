#note Don't want to unload the Z plays ZEP/YOKE or ZITI just yet, they give back huge counters. I hold ZIP with this play, that seems good enough
>Mariah_Smith: FI C3 IF +15 107
>Matt_Canik: AAIMNPZ B1 ZIP +32 207
#note ZAP keeps a much more balanced leave, but ZIP holds A(Z)AN in all cases she doesn't block. Given her two recent fishes, I think it's unlikely she'd be holding an O for a play like A(Z)O, so I think this could be worth it. Q has it about 2 points down, but the rack inference I'm making here probably justifies this play by more than that?

#note 14:14 on C:V ratio... Should I hold the T here and just play WIVES? 

Q says no.
