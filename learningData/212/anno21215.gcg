>John: ?ACELRX F1 eXECRAL +85 229
>John: ?ACELRX --  -85 144
#note My first big mistake.  Any reasonable play leaves me in the mid 80% win after 2 turns while missing a turn due to eXECRAL* knocks me down to 75% and gives away vital information.  AXLED 15A seems to be tops.
>Matt: EPSTU 15K STUPE +39 139
>John: ?ACELRX L11 EX +38 182
#note Now all of a sudden EX is best.  I'll take it.  EXoCARP is fun.

#note Thank good ness all of my valid plays are near optimal - my phony-playing and phony-allowing are killing me.  UNSWEET*.  Sheesh.

#note Nailed it.
>Matt: AORUV L1 VA.OUR +30 310
>John: DIILNST H7 L.NT +14 361
#note This play took me forever and probably cost me the game.  After VAPOUR, I'm wagering that he has the blank.  I think I was at least hoping for the Z.  Neither the D nor F columns were going to allow a monster score but I don't know what possessed me to not move an I.  Especially as I have the S for the SAL and SCAT hooks.  The best play I actually considered was LIDO C12, although NITID F3 and LID F5 are solid.  71% win after 2 turns instead of about 80 with LIDO.
>Matt: AMTZ C11 MATZ. +32 342
>John: DDEIIIS 1J DI.E +8 369
#note Now I'm really screwed.  There's no place to move two Is without emptying the bag.  Which in all likelihood doesn't contain the blank anymore.  I considered DIDIES F2 which comes in third for win% behind ID F6 and DIDIE B7, but I thought that was a game concession.  If I put Matt's actual tiles on his rack though, both DIDIE and DIDIES seem to win.  why?  BECAUSE THE BLANK IS STILL IN THE BAG.  I should have at least played DEVI to disallow ENDIVE.
>Matt: EEILNOY I13 YEN +30 372
#note Should have played YE keeping the N for ENDIVE.
>John: DIIORRS F3 IRIDS +13 382
#note 75% chance to draw the blank and have a shot.  Fail.  ODS M6 is best.
