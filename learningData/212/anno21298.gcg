Marty and Quackle seem to agree, and I will take the lesson to heart.  Be more careful about slotting E's for your opponents.

I decided 20 pts was just too much to pass up on, despite the dreadful leave.  Almost got a challenge out of it.

I had to have misrecorded something here, because my next rack only had the Q in common, and I sure didn't save that.

#note Pre-sim, DO 9L was best, and by quite a bit (3% more to win, 6 valuation pts vs. next best).  My play wasn't on the board.  I don't think Marty would disagree with CP's assessment.  He was happy to see those nice letters go away.  I played scared with ??S unseen, figuring incorrectly he was setting himself up. 
SImming my play at 5 plies and 1000 iterations against, it finished outside the top ten - 6% worse to win, 8 valuation pts back.

>Matthew_Ridout: ABHIORR M9 ABHOR +26 222
#note Since I don't have the new words loaded into Quacklle, I had to run my play on sim (5p, 1000i again).
HARBOR 12I is 15% to win, mine 2nd at just 13%.
>Marty_Gabriel: EKNU L12 NEUK +32 304
#note I wish I knew the rest of Marty's rack here.   In chatting after, he really regretted this move.  Even if he's carrying one of the blanks, there are soooo many good tiles in the bag or my rack.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?EEIRSW J8 .EWRItES +78 300
#note Mine was the only playable bingo.  CP indicates  9% better to win than any other play initially.
Marty offered after that plays along column N that saved the blank might be best, given my slotting the S hook will likely lead to a bad end for me.
After simming at 5p, 1000i, the bingo still sims best, but WEIR N12 (and others) sure closed the gap.
