#note Hey y'all.  Uploading a memorable match vs. #9 in the world Joey Krafchick; I didn't write down racks so a deep analysis is not really possible, but just felt like sharing.  I'm certain I've missed some better plays along the way.
>Joey_Krafchick: AAA -AAA +0 0
>Dan_Heck: OUY 7H YOU +15 41
>Joey_Krafchick: W H7 ..W +9 9
>Dan_Heck: ?AILOTU D3 OUTcA.IL +70 111
#note Couldn't get my mind off of OUTLAIN here, but so happy to find a bingo I only remember seeing once before.
>Joey_Krafchick: EIJNRTU 3C J.INTURE +84 93
#note The feeling of being 100+ pts up didn't last long :-)
>Dan_Heck: ABHS 11B BASH +29 140
>Joey_Krafchick: AEX H1 EA.X +57 150
>Dan_Heck: ?DIINST 1H .DITIoNS +77 217
#note Another nice counter there from Joey, but I fortunately drew well to complement the blank I had when playing BASH.
>Joey_Krafchick: IQ 2E QI +28 178
>Dan_Heck: EEV 12A VEE +16 233
#note This felt like a weak play, but if I recall correctly I also had two more E's and another clunky consonant to clean up.
>Joey_Krafchick: EGR 4J REG +10 188
>Dan_Heck: EEP A12 .EEP +27 260
#note And there's those E's!
>Joey_Krafchick: AH 5J AH +23 211
>Dan_Heck: DG 9C D.G +10 270
>Joey_Krafchick: GNU N1 .UG +8 219
#note I wasn't familiar with this new 3, but also wasn't about to challenge to prevent just 8 points.
>Dan_Heck: ACO O3 OCA +11 281
#note In fact, it was in my best interest to close down the volatile lane anyway (although there are plenty more on this board should Joey draw to a bingo)
>Joey_Krafchick: DER B11 ..RDE +28 247
#note The only words this set of five makes are BREDE and BREED.
>Dan_Heck: AIILMRS 10H SIMILAR +77 358
>Joey_Krafchick: EEORSTT O8 ROSETTE +84 331
#note Joey played this with no hesitation, despite the illegal hook.  Gotta admire confidence!
>Dan_Heck: FOY 11K FOY +35 393

>Dan_Heck: IMP M13 IMP +26 419
>Joey_Krafchick: AAL N12 ALA +26 383
>Dan_Heck: DEOT N5 DOTE +12 431
#note I debated heavily between DOTE and FED in the same spot, but felt the FON leave would give me the greater chance for an out-in-two.  Having the D at all was a stroke of luck that Joey mentioned he had hoped for (ROSETTED!)
