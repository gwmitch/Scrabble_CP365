#note WGPO Middleton Tourney, Round 3.
>Charles_Reinke: GIIJRSY 7F JIG +18 18
#note K5 JIGS is probably worth it.

#note 8D ISO(TOPES) keeps my R for YARER.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: EOU O12 .OUE +12 158
>Charles_Reinke: EIKLQSS N11 Q. +11 81
#note EIKLSS is actually a decent leave, bingoing with ACEINU.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: EF 6G FE +15 173
>Charles_Reinke: EEIKLSS I7 S.IKE +39 120
#note Then I draw my bingo and chicken out on it. SELKIES. I thought I might be getting confused with SILKIES, which means the same thing.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: EITW 6J W.ITE +21 194
>Charles_Reinke: DEGLRSW N2 WERG.LDS +76 196
#note I think I might have just gotten bailed out.

>Charles_Reinke: ?AIOTUU -IOUU +0 251
#note I think I should do G3 OUT(FIT) now since I probably won't get another chance to open that part of the board.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: OY O1 YO +20 300
>Charles_Reinke: ?ADDNPT -DDN +0 251
#note Really tough position. I don't want to do anything to block any bingo lanes, because Peter will not be nice enough to open any more. FIT(S) is pretty much guaranteed to stay open, but it's also hard to hit when I don't have an S. There are no plays that open things up in any reasonable way, and now I've committed to bingoing.

>Charles_Reinke: ??DEOTZ F10 ZED +41 312
#note The second best play statically is the same play but using a blank E.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: ANR C12 RAN +17 339
>Charles_Reinke: ??ENOTU G3 OUT... +10 322
#note Simming takes forever with two blanks. Since I am too impatient for that, we'll just say this is best.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: ACIN H1 CAIN +26 365
#note I have two playable bingos nex turn. Give yourself nine minutes to find one of them and you win!
>Charles_Reinke: ??BENOT 1B BOaTNE.k +60 382
#note When I first saw my rack, I was relieved since it seemed like there would be a lot of bingos to choose from. Then I couldn't immediately find one. I had six minutes on my clock, plus a few more since I could go over and still win if I found the bingo. This one appeared out of nowhere about two minutes into the ordeal. The other playable bingo is BEN(C)hTOp, and the only other word in BCENOT?? is CENOBITE.
