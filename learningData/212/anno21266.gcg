>Charles_Reinke: ADEIINO H4 OIDIA +14 14
#note WGPO Middleton Tourney, Round 1.
>Carol_Dustin: GJ 7G J.G +21 21
>Charles_Reinke: AEELNNV 4G N.VENA +18 32
#note Looked for double-doubles, missed ENL(I)VEN. I played this over other plays because I'm not sure Carol knows NOVENAE.
>Carol_Dustin: EEHILOP 3A PIEHOLE +79 100
>Charles_Reinke: EILOTTZ A1 ZI. +42 74
#note After I saw my 42-point play, I didn't look for bingos here: TOT(A)LIZE. Good start!
>Carol_Dustin: ALUU 5J LUAU +16 116
>Charles_Reinke: ELOTTUW D3 .OWLET +26 100
#note I don't think I even saw 4C TOW...at least this opens the board at the expense of points, leave, equity, and win percentage.
>Carol_Dustin: BITY 8A BIT.Y +30 146
>Charles_Reinke: AEGHSTU C8 .AUGHT +22 122
#note M3 TE(U)GH is 36 points. That has to be the correct play even though it blocks the S hook on LUAU.
>Carol_Dustin: CFO B2 F.CO +28 174
>Charles_Reinke: ADERRRS 11C .RR +8 130
>Carol_Dustin: ?AEFIMR 2G FIREMAn +69 243
>Charles_Reinke: AADDERS 1L DEAD +30 160
#note DADA you idiot. What am I even doing? Here's where I should type something about there only being two A's as opposed to six E's unseen so this is better. If I typed enough words maybe I could even make you believe it.
>Carol_Dustin: BDE 1H BED +35 278
>Charles_Reinke: ANNORSV E3 .NO +18 178
#note Seriously thought about J7 SOVRAN because ANRSV seemed extremely non-bingo prone. Since it was only five points more I decided to play this and keep "fishing".
>Carol_Dustin: AEMNRST J7 SARMENT +77 355
>Charles_Reinke: AENRRSV 11G RAV.NERS +72 250
>Carol_Dustin: EPW 12F PEW +23 378
>Charles_Reinke: ?EKLOTU 8J .UKLET +45 295
#note This blocks the lanes for eights in columns L, M, and N, but do I care? No. If I somehow get a high-scoring bingo on column A and Carol has absolute garbage, maybe I could still win. Quackle suggests F12 (P)OKE; that could actually work given that Carol had the Q and might get rid of it for 34 instead of blocking the trip-trip.
>Carol_Dustin: AQ 10B Q.A +34 412
>Charles_Reinke: ?CGIIOT 5D ..G +7 302
#note No point leaving one in the bag since Carol is not going to bingo out. Should do GI in the same spot.
>Carol_Dustin: ISX 13E SIX +40 452
>Charles_Reinke: ?CIINOT A10 aCTION +36 338
>Carol_Dustin: EOOSY 3M SOY +16 468
>Charles_Reinke: I L8 .I +6 344
>Charles_Reinke:  (EO) +4 348
#note Nobody ever "deserves" to lose, but I certainly played like I did this game.
