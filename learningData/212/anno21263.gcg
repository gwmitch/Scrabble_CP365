#note PAX 7F (not 7A) best, mine outside top ten.  
I liked saving the X, figured I could always play it at 7C if need be the next turn

I knew this could be a poor play on my part, must've spent 4+ minutes on it.  TIDE 11D ranked second best and I had nearly gone with it, btu was afraid of QUAI and maybe even another Q play from him the next turn.
I decided I wasn't losing by giving up an -OLE or-OLS play on row 15.
>Marty_Gabriel: AG E4 AG. +8 340
#note This play threw me, bc no letters remaining in the game could front hook AGE.   Marty was presumably balancing, of course, and had his eye on column 15 for a possible bingo
>Matthew_Ridout: DEIINOT 11D DINO +21 423
#note IODINE 11B ranked best, mine 8th, at 96% to win vs. 98%.
Marty politely commented this was the play I  survived, as a Q draw would really hurt.   I'm not so sure, given that I was saving an I and had spots at O12 and F3.  
IODINE opens a bingo lane, if an inflexible one.   I like the 3rd-rated move of TEIID 11B best now in retrospect.

>Marty_Gabriel: EU D11 .UE +8 348
#note I believe he go the Q on this draw.   Better lucky than good for my part.
