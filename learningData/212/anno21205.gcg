>JD: ACEINOU -AOU +0 0
#note wrong exchange, should throw back OU. this is 3 points worse
>Rich_Baker: BI 8G BI +8 8
>JD: CCEINTW 9F CINCT +20 20
#note difficult play, WINCE sims a couple of points better, but I was willing to get a word on the board that Rich might try to hook an S onto, or challenge.
>Rich_Baker: ABEILNS 7H LESBIAN +64 72
#note he wisely chickened out of CINCTS
>JD: EEGNPVW L3 WEEP.NG +28 48
#note hmm didn't think of PEEVING!
>Rich_Baker: HOO 10D OOH +29 101
>JD: AIJNRVY 5I JIV.Y +36 84
#note JARVEY sims better by a couple. the IN leave does better than ANR here, since no vowels are open and I get an extra chance to draw an S or blank.
>Rich_Baker: IO 11E OI +16 117
>JD: AGMNPRU 12B GRUMP +36 120
#note 5 Rs left, so sims better than GUMP

>Rich_Baker: ??DRSTY 14B i.DuSTRY +74 275
#note luckily for me, rich didn't find DYESTER# at 2I for 98 or the incredible B(LIN)DSTORY# for 89!! Turns out BLINDSTORY and CLEARSTORY are antonyms, but only the latter is good in TWL.
>JD: EHLNNRZ H12 HE.N +33 233
>Rich_Baker: ADEFL 3I FLA.ED +34 309
#note blocks SWEEPING and covers a lot of real estate
>JD: ILNORTZ 13K ZLOT. +28 261
#note ZLOTY at M1 would've been pretty nice. I failed to recognize that the pool is very vowel-heavy (18 of 31 unseen), which makes a play like COZILY better. Quackle's suggestion of RIZ at 2M might also have a chance, but rich will probably block on row 1 in that case. COZILY still an upgrade.
>Rich_Baker: KOV L11 VO.K +22 331
>JD: IMNORRU I11 RIM. +24 285
#note no spot for MURRION#, which I would've tried. maybe my best option is RUG at B10, but it still leaves me down 64, so all rich has to do is score on column A and a bingo still leaves me trailing by a lot. another choice is UNFLAWED at 3G to improve my lane. scoring points is still not such a bad course.
>Rich_Baker: AAILOTU 11K U.A +12 343
>JD: EINOORU 2N OU +10 295
#note it's not looking good, but there are few tiles that can go at 1O after OU, so at least I'm not giving back a huge score - I expect him to block on row 1, but hopefully my lane on row 2 will stay open
>Rich_Baker: AEE 14K A.EE +33 376
#note rich tries to outrun
>JD: EEILNOR 1H ELOINER +78 373
#note rich's last play left 7 in the bag, so he will have the initiative going into the endgame and should win
>Rich_Baker: AGRSTUW 15A SU. +37 413
>Rich_Baker: AGRSTUW --  -37 376
#note !! he has many winning plays, but he played too fast and didn't realize he was playing IU*!!! Just UGS at 15J is enough.
>JD: ADDEFIO B10 FA. +17 390
#note now a bunch of plays win, this is tied with OF at 6I for my best play since DIODE on column A is unblockable without a one-tile play at 11A, and I have a second spot.
>Rich_Baker: AGRSTUW 15J AGS +31 407
>JD: DDEIO A6 DIODE +26 416
#note a very fortunate win!
