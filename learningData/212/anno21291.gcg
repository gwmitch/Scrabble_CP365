#note I see three main options here: 
-XI 3M, which is the standard equity play
-OX 3L, which deviates from equity but allows me to draw into PUE(R)ILE with an E draw and leaves a 3x3 and a juicy scoring spot open, or
-B9 OXLIP, which leaves the board incredibly threat-heavy. Ultimately, I chose to make the conservative play with XI here, but it would have been fun to see where OXLIP went.

#note Wasn't sure if REMEDIAL takes an S (it doesn't), but if it had taken an S I would have foregone the extra two points and played it instead.

#note We're very vowel-heavy right now: 15 V, 12 C, 1 ?. I feel like I'm likely to draw 2V 1C here and bingo next turn a lot. I also take away cheap overlaps for Chris here.

#note I can't afford to fall too much further behind here - we're still very vowel heavy so I'm excited to be drawing into NRT here.

#note Excited to be putting that C right there where it's really threatening
>Chris_Cree: AEHIORY B9 OHIA +17 467
#note Nice and creative play by Chris here - if I bingo from the C with a worst-case play like CONATIVE, he is able to outrun me with a play like YORE A12. He also stops me from making a setup play like AB B9, which I was really excited to play next turn.

#note Figure Chris probably has the F after OHIA, but I don't know what to do. I think the game is lost already.
