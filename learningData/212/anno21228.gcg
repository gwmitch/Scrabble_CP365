#note Already leaning vowel-heavy in this game, but this is so good I have to take it *crosses fingers*
>Robert_Fenske: ADIPV F8 PAVID +27 134
>Matt_Canik: AEIMNOR C11 AERO +11 226
#note Got lucky that time, but we're still quite vowel heavy here. AERO is actually pretty tough to counter on the left without giving me the TWS - he'll need a Y or T to do it. Probably should just play (D)OMAINE though.

#note What was I saying about vowel-heavy?

#note Owwww. I thought it was just COAXERS. Both are good.

#note GAH I wrote down LIBERTINE and then convinced myself that it was a proper noun or a name or something like that. INTERLINE also plays as a 9, and PRELIMIT is another bingo but I think I'd pass it with the Q out.

#note Q wants me to fish the U here, still. This is also 100% to win
