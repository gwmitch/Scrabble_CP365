>Robin_Lewis: ABP 8G BAP +14 14
>Matt_Canik: AEHORTT 9F TORAH +22 22
#note Don't really like playing the higher-varinace fishing plays like HOT or TO or HO against a lower-rated opponent. Q likes fishing (shocker) - TO at 9H is taking the cake here. 
>Robin_Lewis: AMOY 7F MAYO +29 43
>Matt_Canik: AEEHIIT 6C EATH +30 52
#note Horrible oversight of the OPAH spot, HIE is clearly superior here
>Robin_Lewis: JSU E3 JUS. +22 65
>Matt_Canik: AEEIIOT -AEIIO +0 52
#note I ALWAYS MISS EEJIT! I guess that makes me one.

Maybe I exchange 6 here instead to try for the S one more time?
>Robin_Lewis: CEGINST C3 GEN.TICS +80 145

#note DEATH is a word!!!!!
>Robin_Lewis: IOOOUU -IOOOUU +0 145
>Matt_Canik: BDLMRST 4B D.B.T +16 104
#note Choose this because I want to hold the M for HM and the R for MAYOR. I didn't see REDUB or DEBUR, which could be better because of the 4 unseen Rs. Q gives a slight edge (0.5) to REDUB/DEBUR.

#note Again missed DEATH, this time with GADID. 
>Robin_Lewis: ?ADEILT 12D .eTAILED +60 257
>Matt_Canik: AAEISTW 11I AWAIT +29 248
#note Q again likes the fishy AWA on a closed board. TAWIE is probably slightly stronged because of 5 unseen Es with no unseen As. 
>Robin_Lewis: EFGIN M9 FE.ING +28 285
>Matt_Canik: EEEKNSU 6J K.U.E +22 270
#note Nicely sets up the last S which happens to be on my rack
>Robin_Lewis: QVWZ -QVWZ +0 285
>Matt_Canik: ?EENOSU A8 .EUrONES +74 344
#note Oof OUTSEEN is something I should see...........
Should I bingo knowing the Q is in the bag? Maybe I just play (H)O(WE)?
>Robin_Lewis: IORR 14K RI.OR +12 297
>Matt_Canik: LOPQVYZ O13 P.Y +24 368
#note The play is to play L(E)Z next turn. That's lazy - Robin is going to block it. Bad bad bad. 

Oversee PYRO, but Q just says to go ahead and play L(E)Z now. 
>Robin_Lewis: EFR N8 REF +32 329
>Matt_Canik: CLOQRVZ G12 .VO +10 378
#note Thinking:
I have to block WOOLIE. C(A)RL, V(A)LOR, (A)VO do this. None of them win. 

(A)ZO probably gives me the best chance here (but robin definitely has wins even after that). Gah Gah Gah I messed up the PRY turn so badly. Maybe I shouldn't have bingoed?
>Robin_Lewis: EILOOW F14 WO +26 355
>Matt_Canik: CLQRZ 4J L...R +12 390
#note Can't play (FE)Z - she has LE(Z).
