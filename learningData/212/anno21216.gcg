#note FAINT is best.  Trading F is third best behind FRAP.

#note Brutal.  As if with that leave and those tiles on the board, I can't make an 8.  IN D8 sims best, but I'm pitching the N.

#note Nice block.  Except that E is exactly where I wanted it.

#note That's my reward for a 9?  Ugh.  I was not about to trade again.

#note OM 1A wins.  I really felt I needed to move an S and go for the blank.  AENSS is a pretty reasonable leave I guess.

#note My thought process was that YOW was his best way to score and move the W and Y so I wanted to block that spot and set up GRIEVE.  Too bad I didn't see his better play:(
