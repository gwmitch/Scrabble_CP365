#note I thought this choice was super questionable.  Turns out it wasn't too bad.  GECKO is clearly best then everything else is pretty comparable.

#note Oh no, I missed an X 9!  EXECUTaNT is best.  I was looking at EXECUTION or EXECUTING, but I wasn't totally willing to try a two-tile fish to get an I, G or O.  Or better yet I+S or O+S for EXECUTIONs for 122.

#note Didn't actually consider QuALE.  Obvs it's a great play.  Thought about QuELLS 15A.  VEALS was better than that.

#note VINES is maybe better, but I'm still not seeing GI+ when I should.  At least I got a free turn out of MES+
