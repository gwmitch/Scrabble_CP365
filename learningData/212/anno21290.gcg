>Matt_Canik: EELMOPU M3 O.EUM +22 96
#note With the P on my rack, a lead, and no S on my rack, I feel like ODEUM is better than MEOU for 3 more. Q says I'm 0.4 down, but I'm happy with the sacrifice to avoid the variance of the S setup
>Sid_Murali: EEG G6 GEE +13 37
#note Implies he's holding at least one more E... we're running out of those FAST.
>Matt_Canik: EELOPPR 3F LO.PER +26 122
#note Miss two words here, both of which I didn't know: PEOPLER and REPEOPLE!
>Sid_Murali: EZ 5K ZE. +50 87
>Matt_Canik: AAEEIPS F2 A.AE +6 128
#note Really not thrilled about any of the P options along the N row this turn. I'll have my chance to cash in over there. PA(L)EAE is probaby my play if I know that word. 
>Sid_Murali: UU -UU +0 87
>Matt_Canik: AEIIJPS E5 AJI +24 152
>Sid_Murali: ILNST 8A LINTS +29 116
>Matt_Canik: CEINPSU N5 SPIC +41 193
#note Significantly more defensive than the other options, this runs away in a sim. I especially like setting up SPICE for me when I've got one of the only 3 Es remaining. 
>Sid_Murali: AFLMORY A3 FORMA.LY +67 183
>Matt_Canik: EENRTUY 9J RUNTY +21 214
#note Now with just one E unseen, I think this play really favors me since it only creates bingo opportunities making RE (and a few tough 8s lines). 
>Sid_Murali: BCITU D1 CUBIT +27 210
>Matt_Canik: AEENQSU B1 QUA +29 243
#note This should probably just be QUA(R)E - I got too caught up on this idea of having two of the last three Es. 
>Sid_Murali: OOOVVW -OOOVVW +0 210
>Matt_Canik: DEENSWW 6G ..WD +13 256
#note I'm fine with just keeping things closed off here.
>Sid_Murali: IX 8K XI +22 232
>Matt_Canik: DEEHNSW C6 WE.D +11 267
#note Tough turn. I want to stop 8s through LINTS, but this opens up possibilities if (and only if) he can bingo starting with an S. Maybe I should just play WE(N) and take my chances. 
>Sid_Murali: ?ILNOSV 10C SOLVINg +76 308
#note Yowch
>Matt_Canik: EHIKNRS G10 .NK +7 274
#note It'll be really, really tough for Sid to knock this out without opening something else up. The chances for a play like AVID are pretty big, and I may not be able to survive one even if I bingo. Sid is also pretty low on time here, so I don't know how he'll be able to respond...
>Sid_Murali: AAAFNTV E10 .AVA +14 322
#note A pivotal turn. This is Sid's actual rack, too. 

A postgame analysis conclusion was that Sid should probably have just played (K)AFTAN here had he known/seen it. KAFTAN will still win many games where I bingo - I will be forced to bingo from the A column and will give up big counterplays. He can also play (O)VA instead and much things up a little more, or AVA H12 to make my bingos score very little and give up big counterplays. 
>Matt_Canik: ?EGHIRS 14B GRuSHIE +94 368
#note And if I can pull the trigger on SIGHTER or SIGHERS, I win this game 100%. GIRSHES is also 94, but I didn't know it. 

I could have easily been burned here because I was unsure of my high probs - not acceptable at all. 
>Sid_Murali: ADFNRTT -  +0 322
#note Sid cannot see a way to win (and there aren't any ways to win) so he challenges.
