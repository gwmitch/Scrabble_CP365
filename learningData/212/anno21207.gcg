#note Type a note here!I see a bingo and I get blinders on.  Burned to many times playing DSW and drawing VVG.  W(A)DS E5 is the play here.

>John: EEHIILT O3 HILI +19 292
#note HEIL O4 is best here.  I dunno - that's still a lot of Is left in the bag.
>Josh: LOPT 14F PLOT +16 259
>John: EEEOTTT 12G TET +11 303
#note I'm playing chicken now.  I saw TEETH (best) but didn't want to open lanes.  Especially something ending in -ES along row 4.  If Josh can play to the H or I, good for him.  Also saw TOT(E) E8 but was not interested in allowing SMELT.
>Josh: CGINOOV 3L INC. +18 277
>John: AEEHOTY L1 OH.A +16 319
#note Again, thinking "block" instead of "manage the rack, manage the board and score".  This is a horrible play, but I was concerned about that hanging I.  YE(C)H N1 is best but I bet YE(Z)+ is pretty good.
>Josh: DNOR 1H ROND. +18 295
>John: EEEITUY K13 YE. +25 344
#note Didn't see it last turn - saw it with this rack.
>Josh: BDGIINS -BDGII +0 295
>John: EEIINTU 10F UTE +14 358
#note Q suggests ETUI 15C and TUI K4 but it's hard to really evaluate these choices at this point in the game.  One other suggestion is intriguing: (BO)ITE 9C.  I'm probably drawing 2 consonants on three tiles...maybe for some good stuff on row 2?
>Josh: LO E8 LO +13 308
>John: DEGIIIN 15B INDIE +12 370
#note Spent too much time earlier in the game...for some reason played this instead of sticking with NIDI 15C...this is a free rack clear for Josh.  Q suggests I(R)ED 10L setting up DINING/DIVING (good considering the bag is NNVV) but would allow DEBUGS for a nice loss.
>Josh: BEGISUX 14B XU +38 346
>John: GINNVV G3 VIV. +14 384
#note If only I could tell Q that my opponent in fact does not want to go out with GIBES 2E.  All of the plays that allow GIBES look artificially good...but end up allowing way too many points back if Josh plays SIB or SIG+ A8.  Walking through a couple of plays makes it obvious that the main goal is to not get V stuck and hope he misses something.  VIV(E) scores more than VIV(A) so there you go.
>Josh: BEGIS A8 SIG +33 379
>John: GNN 12L ..NG +10 394
#note It looks like the only winning play for Josh was SIB, not SIG, then E(N)G M2.  I have two winning plays: (FA)NG and G(INCH)+ that scores just a bit more...
