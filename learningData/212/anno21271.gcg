#note After a whole game of mostly straightforward decisions, this one stumped me. I straight-up missed the highest-scoring option, 15L GNAR, which I would have played without hesitation if I had seen it. This sims very, very badly, and looking back on it, I can't figure out why I chose it over something more obvious like 7G GA(Y).

#note My bad play kind of worked out! That means it wasn't a bad play, right?

#note Emptying the bag is a bad idea since Lisa will almost always go out before I do. Quackle hates this and thinks I4 EF will win almost a third of the time. I like K11 F(E)E(T) since it scores the same as my play but doesn't disturb any bingo lines.

#note As soon as the position got complicated I started making horrible plays. There is a lesson here but I'm too obtuse to figure out what it is.
