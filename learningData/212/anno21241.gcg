#note I wanted to do M3 TUX or LUX, but that just seemed sooo bad when I knew she had the EL for a K column counter play. But everything else is lousy. I guess I can play TUX and hope she hit her bingo so I can score the LOX hot spot myself? I decided to just go for the X bomb again. Seems fine,  I think

#note Interesting that this sims so far ahead of 14K LUX, which keeps the S, scores 11 more, and blocks KINDLE. But I'm just sooo damn likely to hit my X bomb. This turn for sure, right?

#note In the old book I might have done VERMIN to block a bunch of lanes. But it takes an S now. I'm just gonna score some points and race toward the end with my big lead.

#note She table talked that she drew the same two letters again, so I decided to play the more fun placement. To be clear: don't play Scrabble like me.
