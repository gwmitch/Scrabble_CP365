#note WIT B13 best, mine 5th.
I need a bingo badly, and don't have the A or S back hooks for WET, while WIT would leave me a chance at hooking for WITE

#note I never, ever considered EGGRESS' front hook.   My ROOTING was -not- homeless.  Oy.

#note EF 1A  is best chance to win, those FECES 12H valuates better.
I thought AEFS was a solid leave.  Though it could easily be mucked up with a play on column K or M, I'm figuring I at least carry the case S for VIVAS possibility.  But my play was outside top ten

#note BEEP 13H.   Everything revolves around saving for QUEY15H.   Obviousy it's not enough for a win, this oversight on my part was very bad.

#note CRITERIA is a rare miss for someone of Marty's caliber - but he's got this game and thusly a tournament title - wrapped up without it
