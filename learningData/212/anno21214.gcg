>Ryan: CEIQRRW -CEIQ +0 0
>John: AENNORT -N +0 0
#note As I dumped the N in the bag I said "I think I'm putting a new bingo back in the bag"...I was.  I wasn't sure if NORTENA+ or NORTENO+ was good..it's both.
>Ryan: ?DEHLNR 8D HaNDLER +78 78
>John: AEFNORT 9H OF +20 20
#note OAF is apparently better.  Because doubling up the A in lane E isn't a good thing, maybe?
>Ryan: AEU 9D EAU +11 89
>John: AENORST K8 SENATOR +75 95
>Ryan: HMPW 13I WH.MP +38 127
>John: CDGIQRS 15G GRIDS +29 124
#note QIS 10B is better by a lot.  I'm pretty sure I never saw it, focussing instead on the bottom row.
>Ryan: AAEL 14J A.EAL +31 158
>John: BCIOQRV C9 BORIC +33 157
#note COB 15M scores just as well and keeps the I for the Q.
>Ryan: LOS 15M SOL +16 174
>John: ABIQTVZ 11B B.AVI +20 177
#note BIT 10F wins.  Was wondering why it was better than BAT, but I suppose there are more Is left, ZA works well together and I might draw to QA(I)D 12A.
>Ryan: AKN 12A KA.N +34 208
>John: EEENQTZ A12 .EET +24 201
#note Really not sure why KNEE is tops here.
>Ryan: EGIR L9 REGI.. +29 237
>John: EINOQUZ M5 QUOIN +20 221
#note ZONE M7 31 is a bit better.  I think that after five turns I was tired of the Q being on my rack.
>Ryan: UV G13 VU. +11 248
>John: CEEGTXZ 6L C.Z +34 255
>Ryan: DEMO N8 DEMO +20 268
>John: EEGTUXY 14F X. +25 280
#note I saw TUYER J4 but I didn't think it was a strong enough play.  Ryan was making a bunch of short, low-scoring plays so I put him on some great tiles...didn't think there was much sense feeding him a new lane.
>Ryan: IT N4 TI. +23 291
>John: EEGPTUY O1 TYPE +33 313
>Ryan: AN 13E NA. +15 306
>John: EGITTUW O11 WIG +13 326
#note Trading all also simmed well.
>Ryan: AL J10 AL +13 319
>John: EJOTTUY 2K JUTT. +30 356
#note I'm pretty much screwed here.  Ryan is sitting on all of the good stuff and can counter anything I throw at him.  JOTTY sims slightly better.
