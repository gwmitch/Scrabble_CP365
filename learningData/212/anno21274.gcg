#note N8 (C)OZIE appears to give me the S hook I want, but in reality, it will probably get blocked by plays at O12. I hesitated to make this play because it blocks the only line for sevens while not giving me a new one. However, it is not necessary to go all-out for a bingo at this point.

#note I knew HINKY but didn't explicitly remember HINKIEST. That, combined with Ian chuckling and shaking his head as he put it down, made me challenge. Even if his body language hadn't been so obvious I probably still would have challenged since I am in really bad shape here.

#note 5B MID. Quackle estimates that this error cost me 0.00% winning chances, although at times it will say MID has a 0.01% winning chance.
