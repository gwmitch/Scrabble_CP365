ACI vs EI leave - saving a consonant wasn't worht 6 pts it seems

#note AZAN K2 best, mine 9th
AZAN scores 3 more.  I prefer AA to II in a leave.  Am surprised AZAN valuates a whooping 11 pts better and 6% less likely to lose

#note INCLIP (which which I was unfamilar) best, mine 4th.  I considered LIPID, the 2nd best play, but even with a blank in hand didn't want to leave myelf vowel-free

#note INN J12 best, mine 6th
Looks lk I'm getting too conservative.  With only 20 tiles unseen to me and two of them esses, seems to me a very good chance he's gt at least one.  If I play from J12 and he makes a solid  score to 15H, my hopes look sunk.
Instead I opted to waiti for a mistake from Andy to open the board, play close, and figured if he didn't make an error, I could maybe have advantage in a tight end game with the blank.

#note ENTERED G1 was a behemoth, runaway winner here.  I'm really confused how this play puts me at nearly 60% to win, since Andy would've undoubtedly played along Row 1 for a solid score at veryy least and dashed my comeback hopes.

#note TANK 51 simmed best, mine outside top 10.   
Same strategy issue as before.   I feel like if I create a lane, Andy can kill it for two many points.

#note A sliver of light!   But the only bingo that plays is TOOLSET, a new one I didn't know.  Next best was COD D4.  I don't think 15 pts is enough here, and I want to switch to playing for a bingo near the end here.
My play (3rd best) can't be easily well-blocked, but forces my blank to be an N or K.  And it probably forces him to block the Row 2 bingo lane.
There are 8 possible bingos with K that play I can draw to, per Zyzzyva, and i knew 5 of them.  There are 43 bingos I could draw to with the blank as an N that play, and I was familiar with all but three.

#note What execution!  Perhaps...genius?   I hit it!  i hit it!
...And then made maybe the biggest gaffe I've made in years.  I missed NOTATES.  I looked for over three  minutes of my four and change left.  I  shuffled tiles, thought about affixes.   I got as close as TONATES* in my mind.   I wrote the natural anagram down.
Self-forgiveness is an art.  I'm working on it :)
(I knew NOOS* wasn;t good unless it was miraculously a new word I'd forgotten.)
