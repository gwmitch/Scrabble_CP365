>Darrell_Day: FO K5 FO. +16 49
>Matt_Canik: AIINOTT J4 OI +7 57
#note A few options here and each one does something completely different: 
TITIAN L1 scores 21, throws things wide open, and blows up the rack. 
IOTA L2 scores 13, keeps a little synergy together, but still opens the board. 
OI J7 scores just 7 but gives back very little to Darrell when he doesn't have an S. If he *had* an S last turn, he probably plays YAWPS and FO?S.

So I chose OI. 
>Darrell_Day: INV 4G VIN. +8 57
>Matt_Canik: AEINTTU H1 ETU. +12 69
#note But now I'm scared - Darrell seems too happy to be shutting off the board. Maybe he does have an S? So I decide to open things up. 

Also worth of consideration: (T)UT, (T)AU setting up TAUT, (V)AU, (O)UTA.

#note HETEROTIC!!!
>Darrell_Day: AEFGOR 1A FORAGE +38 114
>Matt_Canik: AEGILRT 2A AREG +24 119
#note Fishing here is the wrong idea: I want to be turning over tiles for the S for YODS. 
>Darrell_Day: BIITU N1 .UBITI +24 138
>Matt_Canik: GILMSTZ O6 TIZ +38 157
#note I see that the Z is really powerful for REZ+ plays at 3C but oversaw that I could draw SEZ a good amount of the time. I only saw that As would lead me ZA plays. I should just play GL(I)M and keep the spot open.

>Matt_Canik: GILMPSU 10C GLUMPS +25 182
>Matt_Canik: GILMPSU --  -25 157
#note Aaaaand I suck. GLUMPY but no GLUMP
>Darrell_Day: ?ABLNRV 3A NAB +29 202
>Matt_Canik: GILMPSU 10D PLUGS +18 175
#note Just sort of air-mail this turn in. SIGLUM is a neat word I didn't know, (T)UMP also holds the important S. 
>Darrell_Day: EORSU D7 ROU.ES +18 220
#note ROUPES* gah I'm so bad
>Matt_Canik: ?ACIMQS F10 .MIAQ +36 211
#note Really excited to set up the S spot here, but maybe ROUPES* held another S?
>Darrell_Day: DEEJNOS 15B JONESED +115 335
#note No, it didn't, according to Darrell.
>Matt_Canik: ?CLMRSY 6B MYC +27 238
#note CYM(O)L
>Darrell_Day: ADENV 12F .NVADE +14 349
>Matt_Canik: ??HLRRS L12 RuSH +42 280
#note With a strong threat of plays like WALLED or WALED, I decide to give up on bingoing and knock out the spot.
>Darrell_Day: ADEILLW 14J WI.ED +34 383
>Matt_Canik: ?ALR E3 LARs +16 296
#note phew! correctly back out of THRAL* here, even though THRALDOM is good.
