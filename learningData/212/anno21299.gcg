#note quackle likes WOXEN instead. I guess I can get that since I don't have any big X spots for next turn

#note wasn't sure what to do here. No I for DISANNEX#. this is tied for first with DEX.

#note so in case you haven't noticed yet, no I's have been played. AEILNR is pretty dynamite so I might as well go for that. If the distribution wasn't so weird I would play something like RENAL at 13C and go for a blank.

#note I'm glad I remembered this as it's the only playable bingo that doesn't put a tile in the 3x3 lane

#note can't really play TALAQ with IIIIIIIUUU unseen. VROW is an interesting alternative.
>opponent: DEINOST O8 .STONIED +80 324
#note STONIED# plays on the bottom for 90

#note AELRT leave with a very good chance at drawing an I. Quackle likes playing U(T)A instead for another bingo line on the bottom. 
>opponent: ?IIITUZ G7 ...I +14 350
#note best play, has several shots at getting winning moves in two spots. for example UTILIZE/UTILIZED, AZURITE, etc. Fortunately I had all the tiles he needed
