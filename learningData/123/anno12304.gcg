#note Yup, I overdrew. Most actual plays just close down the board more, and I'd rather not do that. Perhaps I should keep INRS instead of RS?

#note The case L should be useful for scoring later, so I kept it.

>Peter_Armstrong: GW D10 W.G +27 315
>Noah: AEHILNN L12 NAIL +27 363
#note I thought here about NAIL, HEIL, HEAL or HAIL. I liked this best because two Ns are clumsy, while the H is a strong scoring tile, still reasonably useful on this tight board. One option I didn't consider was (e)H/H(I), which is interesting. I don't really like it's mediocre leave though, especially since I can often drop the H there later.
>Peter_Armstrong: BIM M3 MIB +20 335
#note Peter drew the Q after this Q-blocking play.

#note Huge break!
>Noah: DEINNOR 10I .E. +12 402
#note Given the inference, and the Q's presence, I need to block this spot and play few tiles. I liked this because of the prevalence of Es in the bag, but really, another E will not be all that bad, and the O is not at all awesome here. I should really be keeping the E for the DEWAX/REWAX possiblities.
>Peter_Armstrong: AERY M7 RY. +15 350
>Noah: DEINNOR -  +0 402
#note Thought about DE(WAX), which sets up a QI spot, but that can easily be blocked by Peter. This looks correct. I can't lose if I don't draw the Q, while I should be okay blocking if he tries something creative.

>Noah: DEINNOR K7 D.... +13 415
#note I had plenty of time left, but for some reason wanted to play really fast. But Peter was already over on time, and he didn't seem likely to lose another minute. I could've taken my time and figured out a much better endgame than mindless blitz slowplay.
