>Lou_Cornelis: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Rafi: BJNOSWX 9E JOW +29 47
#note My thoughts with JOW were that a play down from the J (or an O draw) gives me a huge X play, and that a parallel play gives me the JOB overlap. JO does similar things, but scores 10 more points (although if I don't draw a vowel I'm in bad shape). Tough call which is better - I think I overlooked JO because JOW is more fancy, but JOW might actually be the better play.

#note Think I should have played FOX. BNNS might bingo, while BFNNS is pretty dreadful.
>Lou_Cornelis: ?ADEGPR J5 GRAsPED +73 145
>Rafi: ABFHNNS -BNF +0 101
#note I saw the triple-triple possibilities with AHNS (PHANTOMS and HANDSOME) and thought it made more sense to go for those than to play JAB. Didn't see BHANGS though, which is a decent alternative. If I draw the P, D, or blank then fishing for the 144-point triple-triple next turn could be an option.

#note Who cares about ING bingoes. FAIN is clearly better. I think I overvalued the chance that I could use that spot later (only 2 tiles unseen overlap the U). 12 points is a lot of points, and 4 tiles to draw gives me a decent shot at an S.

#note I'm pretty clueless what to do here. I figured leaving tiles in the bag could lead to more opponent mistakes, and I saw the potential to draw TERRINES through the R (SEROTINE is also possible). There's better options than TIKI, but I don't know which of Quackle's plays actually has a legitimate shot.
