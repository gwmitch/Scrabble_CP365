#note Phony. Oops. I was actually pretty sure it was good, but I must have been thinking of INTIME. The best real play is E5 NINE, which blows.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: INNORRZ 12J .IZ +30 117
#note I was paranoid about giving back easy points with FRIZ, but that's a huge equity hit to take in the name of defense. Not a good decision.
>Ross_Brown: EEGIIOT E6 GIE +9 69
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ALNNORR 13E NOR +11 128
#note I wanted to block the C column after what seemed like a fish, but there was nothing appealing. I decided to let him bingo and hope to hit one, too.

#note 14F BAL sims better. Seemed sketchy, but it's not nearly as dangerous as it seems.

#note So I have 3 of the 4 letters for ALDICARB, but there's only one I left, and no reasonable fishes. So forget that. L2 FARD actually ekes out the sim, but I would never open the board for him. Plus I showed him the X when I put down PIX and picked it up, so keeping the X wasn't too valuable.

#note Okay, this was an interesting position. There were now a couple prime bingo lines available, and neither was especially easy to block and score. I decided to throw the board open and either hit my own bingo, or race his wth the many high-pointers left. As long as his bingo isn't too many points, that should work. It sims best, at least, but I wonder if most humans would instinctively play blocky here. Kill the D, since that's the line that could hurt the most? N2 ADO does sim second best.
>Ross_Brown: ?EEGLSV 1A SELVaGE. +98 322
#note Yowch, was afraid of something big like that.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AADNSU 4B lADANU.S +70 384
#note Luckily I got my bingo back. Also spotted QUADRANS, which is a neat word. Didn't see PANDURAS, but this will do the trick. Not too sure why this only wins 88%. How do I lose here?

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: KOPY 3C KOP +37 421
#note Um. Okay. end of the game in Game 4 of a tough match in the evening time, and I haven't eaten dinner yet. Let's hope I wouldn't have missed YAPOK if it had mattered.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (ARUY) +14 448
#note Played and phony and misjudged some moves like FIZ and maybe CARB, but overall a good enough effort, I guess. Drawing three bingos always helps.
