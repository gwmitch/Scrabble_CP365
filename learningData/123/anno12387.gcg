#note Here's the position I'm stuck on. I want to block the main Q spot (and a possible huge one at that). If he has (or gets) the Q it should be game over. Hence I didn'y play OUZO, though I guess that blocks QAT. But QAID scores more and is more likely with an extra D unseen, and obviously I can't allow QAIDS 76.
