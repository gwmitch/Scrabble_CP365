>Randall_Thomas: ENOSZ 8D ZONES +48 48
#note My luck can't get too much worse than last round, or so I think.
>Matthew_Larocque: AACHIIP D4 CAPI. +36 36
>Randall_Thomas: DFNU E7 F.UND +23 71
>Matthew_Larocque: AAHILRW 7G HAW +28 64
>Randall_Thomas: GHOTU C8 OUGHT +25 96
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILRR H1 REGALI.. +30 94
#note Phony pluralization. Can't remember if I saw RE(FOUND), or thought it was phony and didn't play it. Luckily I got away with this, so I didn't lose out too much.
>Randall_Thomas: Y G7 ..Y +13 109
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIOQR -EEIOQ +0 94
#note I'd probably opt to take 30 points here and then exchange next turn if I have too. Probably missed the spot completely.
>Randall_Thomas: OO 4D .OO +5 114
#note Randall gives me a break....
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEIRT 10C .E.E +7 101
#note Geez....now I have to follow suit. Q likes longer plays like EERIE at B11 or F10, but I don't really agree. He doesn't need TWS hooks or a chance at a 3x3 after he fished. EE(L)IER I could go for, though.
>Randall_Thomas: AIO 12A IO.A +10 124
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIORTT I2 TOE +12 113
#note Oh nice, (A)ERO(L)ITE for 38. That's the one. This is about 2nd, but an extremely distant second.
>Randall_Thomas: ?AEKNPS A8 rANP.KES +167 291
#note *facepalm*
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIRTV -  +0 113
#note Didn't seem like he'd phony like this... but I couldn't remember if it was RAN, RAM, or both.
>Randall_Thomas: AABIX 5B AB.XIA. +52 343
#note Wicked play. Now I'm limping to another blowout....
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIRTV 14A .VITE +16 129
#note Probably took 6-8 minutes on this one, was totally lost. Q thinks it sucks, but I wanted to reach the other side of the board in case he tried to go operation lockdown.
>Randall_Thomas: ABDR 15E DRAB +24 367
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMRST 13E MISRATE +67 196
#note Might as well throw some big hooks out in the open, what do I have to lose except gobs of spread?
>Randall_Thomas: EQRU K11 QU.ER +28 395
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEFRRU 12K .RD +8 204
#note Can't really measure plays on win % because they all read 0%. Might as well fish and try to break 300, I guess.
>Randall_Thomas: DEGIL L10 GI.DLE +36 431
#note Stellar fit, Randall. He wasn't this merciless last time I played him.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFILRU 1A FLoURIE. +83 287
#note Shot in the dark. With a lead like his, it felt like he wouldn't touch the word judge on this one. FLOURY is good, but that's all. I laughed to myself about making the blank an R to make FLURrie(R).
>Randall_Thomas: MO 6B MO. +27 458
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIJNVY I12 J.Y +13 300
#note Q says VINC(A) and don't worry about the J.
>Randall_Thomas: NOW 15K ..WON +24 482
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINNV O11 VENI. +9 309
#note Should have taken out the OX spot, I think I forgot about it.
>Randall_Thomas: LSTT 2F ST.. +12 494
>Matthew_Larocque: CN B4 C.. +7 316
#note C(OX)
>Randall_Thomas: LT E3 L.. +10 504

>Matthew_Larocque: N --  -10 316
#note Nope.
>Randall_Thomas: T 14N T. +8 512
#note "Goldie Hawn?"
>Randall_Thomas:  (N) +2 514
#note -10 timer. Still got over 300! Then again it would be pretty sad if two bingos didn't net me 300 points at least...
