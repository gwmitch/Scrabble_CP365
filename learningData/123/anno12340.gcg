#note No idea what to do here. Quackle likes SIP. I think my play would put me close enough where a bingo wouldn't be necessary. I'm not really sure what my best chances are after SIP.

#note Obviously can't play PIETA with the remaining pool. I can't really try to set myself up either.

Quackle says my play wins 3/8 times. PEAT and PIETA in the same spot win 5/8 times. PEA/APE in the bottom left win 4/8 times. I just figured I had to leave myself one consonant for sure, but I guess I should have risked leaving three vowels with my blank. As it turned out he had EGILNRT so I dodged a bullet there.

#note the best play here is pretty awesome
>scott_jackson: ?AIIOT E2 TIm...O +26 422
#note well I found the second best play. I considered the first best play sTOA(E) but I didn't want to leave II. It's three points better. At least nothing wins.
