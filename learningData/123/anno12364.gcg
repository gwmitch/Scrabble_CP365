#note Didn't know STROBIC, SORBITIC#, CROSSBIT#. Missed BISECTOR, and also BISTROIC despite seeing it recently in an annotated game. The tile gods are asleep at the controls, though, as I will be rewarded with a run of good tiles.

#note Best.

>Bill: CDEHIST 1G S.ITCHED +71 197
#note I didn't want to put an S in the triple lane for three more points with DITCHES at 7/9I, and I had no idea whether SAIKEI takes an S, which it does.

#note Even on this rack I can't find the best play. FUNFAIR for 96. I have seen it. DANDRUFF is another fun one.

#note Pretty dumb here... I liked this to take out N10 ZA and any possibility of a Z...S/LANOLINES play, but PAY scores four more and effectively kills the spot Z or no Z (barring an -SS ending using the blank or just dumping the S for 27). It didn't even cross my mind, as I was clearly keen to get another consonant off the rack, but it seems clearly better. Interestingly 14J PYET# (didn't know it anyway) is best by valuation and stays best in a sim, but that in particular seems like dousing myself in gasoline and handing Quackle a match (ZAGS would score a staggering 126). If I specify just a Z, PYET drops down several places and PAY is best. The sim results are far from decisive in any case, but if I'm going to block the spot I might as well do it right.

>Bill: ADEOVVZ 6J ZED +66 373
#note Vowels are a little on the scarce side, so I went for the 2:2 leave. Also one more chance to draw S?.

>Bill: AEEEGOV 14J GEE +25 431
#note I figured I had to do something about the spot at this point, but this just strengthens TOYS or NOYS#. 13C ETAGE# (didn't know it) wins the sim handily.
>Quackle: DDNORSU 15L NO.S +58 434
>Bill: AEOORTV 4K ORA +25 456
#note I can't hide from my ineptitude in the endgame. No fewer than fourteen plays win. In this case I thought I had it even without an out in two, so I fell for the lure of a nice interior play.
>Quackle: CDDRU E7 C.R +17 451
>Bill: EOTV M7 VOT. +12 468
#note At least this is the only play that salvages half a point.
