>Jerry_Lerman: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>Doug_Brockmeier: CDIOSUZ G8 .UOD +15 15
#note Best appears to be either 9G ID 19, or 9E DUI 17.  QUOD is valued at 7 fewer points.  Even QUIZ, which I thought was a poor way to rid myself of the Z because of all the comeback opportunities, sims 5 points better than QUOD.  Slightly better than that was DUCI 9D 20 - about the same value as DUI
>Jerry_Lerman: DEINORS 12A DINEROS +85 107
#note The double double INDORSED 11E 90 was superior...and with the safer board position, sims 10-11 points higher.
>Doug_Brockmeier: CIILNSZ 10F Z.IC +35 50
#note ZOIC sims better than C10 ZI(N)C 30 by about 2.5 points.
>Jerry_Lerman: AIV A12 .IVA +24 131
>Doug_Brockmeier: ILLNSWY 14A .INYL +22 72
#note WELLY at D11 for only 15 sims better.  Even using the S on VINYLS for only 6 extra points sims better.  VINYL is 4 points worse than WELLY and one point poorer than VINYLS
>Jerry_Lerman: ANPU 11B PUNA +24 155
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?LORRSW 15E OWLS +23 95
#note This ugly play actually sims BEST.  Next best is (O)RS at F12 for 19, about a point poorer
>Jerry_Lerman: AJT 7H TAJ +13 168
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?EEFRRY 8J oRFREY +53 148
#note Even my 53 point phoney (orfrAY and orphrEy are both good) didn't win the sim.  EERY at 14G for 19 sims better- by about 4 points.  Winning chances are now hovering around 30% (up from 20% after DINEROS)
>Jerry_Lerman: AAEIL M8 .EALIA +14 182
>Doug_Brockmeier: CEEEGHO O3 ECHOE. +17 165
#note My choice sims badly: 9 points worse than YOGEE O8 for only 10.  REECHO K8 for 22 is also  a worthy choice - 7 better than ECHOEY.  Other better alternatives were 11K GE(L)EE 12  and 14H OGEE 9 - both 2 points better than ECHOEY. 
>Jerry_Lerman: ABENS N10 BANES +42 224
>Doug_Brockmeier: EEGNRRT 12I RENT..G +20 185
#note RENTING simmed best - with TREEING there almost as good.
>Jerry_Lerman: DEEUV K10 VE.DUE +20 244
>Doug_Brockmeier: EFGHIKR N5 EH +31 216
#note EH sims best...but winning chances are still under 20%
>Jerry_Lerman: AORTTU 3I OUTRAT. +16 260
>Doug_Brockmeier: DFGIKRT J2 K.FI +21 237
#note GRIFT 4F 17 blocks the openings that Doug's created and sims 4 points better than KUFI, and 2 points better than GIFT in the same place.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?EILOPS 5E POLIc.ES +86 346
>Doug_Brockmeier: ABDGIRT 4F DAB +21 258
#note GAB there is a tad better.  There's another G to be drawn, I guess.  Both have less than 3% winning chances.
>Jerry_Lerman: AGM 6D MAG +23 369
>Doug_Brockmeier: GIMORTW L1 WO.T. +24 282
#note WORMS there is betterw
