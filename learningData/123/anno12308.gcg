#note I bit of an interesting play. I thought about exchanging EII or EIII, or NIECE. I didn't really like keeping two Is and giving a strong place to play on a closed board, so no NIECE for me. I didn't see a good reason to keep the I, CEN just seemed better here. I'm not a fan of ICIER because of all the Ds out, which leaves ICE. But EIIN is just pretty bad here, especially after he probably takes the scoring spot on line 8/column o.

#note Didn't think of TAUPE. My reasoning behind this play is actually quite bad. I was thinking I should keep EE because there aren't many Es left, and they could be precious later on. This just isn't the strongest reasoning. Es aren't the best tile ever, and there's no reason to keep a mediocre leave when there are still three left! It's okay to just play something like TAUPE or PAREU and keep one E, Noah.

#note I thought here like I did with aperture, but luckily didn't find KEX, which I probably would've played. KEX is not a great play!

#note This is Chris's actual rack. In the pre-endgame, I found TOMTIT, which seems like a good idea. It turns out it would've tied with my draw!
