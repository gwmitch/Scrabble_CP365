#note Aw, I really liked ex. 7, but I told myself that Quackle never likes ex. 7. But that's the best trade. QUOIT and UTOPIA sim well, too, but I just didn't feel like limping through this rack or opening some choice lines for Ross.

#note I had about five minutes here. I spent time ensuring I didn't have a seven. Then gave the T a quick look, but decided I needed to plan my bingo for next turn. I really, really needed to give that T an extra look. Two easy bingos, and I just didn't spend the time on that spot! TOLE is awful. I wanted to keep the I to bingo to the G, but then I blocked the spot. And opened a spot for him to outrun my bingo. TOTEMITE still doesn't win more than half of the time, but it is miles better than what I did here. Crash and burn!!!!

#note One absolutely awful play toward the end was enough to kill my chances this game. Totally crumbled under the pressure of a crucial position!
