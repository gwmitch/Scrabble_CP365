#note Ugh, stupid me. It's *SLATTER that's invalid. I get those confused all the time.

>Ben_Settle: DEG 6H .GED +8 98
>Matthew_Larocque: BCDEELR G5 BRED +25 142
#note BE(SMEARERS). Ridiculous..... come on. BREDE is a word, and I must have missed C(E)LEB.
>Ben_Settle: ENV 3H ...VEN +24 122
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEEEL K3 .EL. +22 164
#note This looks awful, but I doesn't sim as awful as I thought. Still, not knowing BREDE hurt me here.
>Ben_Settle: L L3 .L +18 140
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEEFJ 9L EF +20 184
#note Still looking awful but finishes around 3rd/4th in the sim. BREDE... must remember.
>Ben_Settle: ARZ K10 .ZAR +26 166
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEIJN 5E JI.. +26 210
#note Haha, C(ET)ANE. I just played TENACES a couple days ago in a game, forgetting the anagram. I should have learned it from this game which is almost a year old!
>Ben_Settle: TV 12J V.T +12 178
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEENO E5 .OE +10 220
#note This is what, my forth turn with a vowel loaded leave? Never has not knowing a 5 letter word been so costly....
>Ben_Settle: UUUU -UUUU +0 178
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEENNT I6 .EN +13 233
#note This is my fifth turn playing off only two letters.... feels as though I'm going to barely crawl past 300 points if I don't get a bingo.
>Ben_Settle: DIPSY 8A DIPSY +50 228
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACENT C8 .ANCEtTA +74 307
#note Ok, I know DIPSY* isn't a word - maybe I was unsure at the time. But I didn't know CATENAs, so I had to leave it to play a bingo. But it's questionable to let him have 50 points to score 74... CAfTANE(D) would have been better at least!
>Ben_Settle: AIN -  +0 228
#note Didn't expect a challenge....
>Matthew_Larocque: EILOSUU 15A LU.U +15 322

>Matthew_Larocque: EFIOORS 14E ROOFIES +78 400

#note REALLY didn't expect a challenge.....
>Matthew_Larocque: GKOORUX 13G GOX +48 448
>Ben_Settle: IP 10E PI +14 254
>Matthew_Larocque: AIKORUU A6 KU.U +9 457
#note Clean sweep of the Us! Can't remember if I saw KI(E)R, but I also can't imagine turning down 30 points.
>Ben_Settle: BDI 2L BID +19 273
>Matthew_Larocque: AAHIMOR 1M HAO +27 484
#note Sim likes MOIRA B2, but that also empties the bag....and he'll likely use two of the TWS squares while I'd use just one.
>Ben_Settle: IO B5 OI +12 285
>Matthew_Larocque: IMNORTY 15F MOT +41 525
#note C2 MIRY leaves me NOT 15F next turn to go out.
>Ben_Settle: ACW C3 CAW +21 306
>Matthew_Larocque: INRY 12B Y.N +16 541
#note Again, this was pretty poorly thought out. R(E)IN leaves me with the Y which gets me 10 points in two spots.
>Ben_Settle: W L8 W.. +10 316
>Matthew_Larocque: IR O1 .I +9 550
#note I could have went out in two turns - instead, I let him go out. Yeah.
