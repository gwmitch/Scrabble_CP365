#note uh, oops! I put down EROSIVE and JESTINGS on the board and stared at it for a minute or so, but just couldn't pull the trigger. I've played some phonies against Mike before so I was pretty sure he would challenge, but I thought the odds of it being a word were ~20%...so it goes.

#note I'm quite surprised that EXPO sims better, but it does set up a nice spot for the W.

#note marlon pointed out on x-tables forums that OW at 14B might be better because it blocks LARDY, creates a tricky lane at A8 and scores 5 more. I think it's pretty close.

#note this doesn't sim so great until I put in a play like ZERK for him that blocks my bingo lanes - he is quite likely to do something along those lines next turn in which case I won't have anywhere left to bingo. That said after people arguing about this on x-tables I'd have to say this play makes no sense...it just gives up really cheap points and doesn't even create a new lane (C would still be there). Might as well play OOH or something.

#note the key moment - I spent ages looking for a bingo and then tried this figuring that I had no other way to win the game...little did I know JESTINGS was good!! the problem is that I took so long that I only had 45 seconds or so to make the rest of my moves.

#note the rest of this game happened extremely fast for me...in retrospect OKA would've prevented the creation of the big hook for the S. but then again, I can also draw it so this isn't such a terrible mistake, especially under time pressure when drawing the S may be the easiest way for me to win the game.

#note I didn't write my rack down at the time but I believe this is right. This was a really significant error caused ultimately by me taking too long to gamble on SINOPIA. Remember...when you make a desperation play, make sure to leave yourself with enough time to actually pull out the win if your gamble pays off.

#note this is the best try I have, giving me an almost certain out and a win if I can pull the S.
