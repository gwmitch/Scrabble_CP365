#note Normally I would play AURAL or LAURA, but I know the extensions and I figured my opponent wouldn't know all of them.
>Erickson_Smith: DFIMO K4 DIFO.M +24 24
#note I held for a couple of minutes remembering BIFORM and really had no idea. I know Erickson has been gaining tons of rating recently (and was one of my Roto picks!) so who knows what he's been studying. This play also improved my options so I figured it wasn't quite worth the risk to challenge.

>Rafi: EGGINTU N4 .UGG +13 339
#note GIGUE/EL is another good option, leaving NT with a 14-vowel 8-consonant pool. It also blocks the best bingo lane based on the pool, and leaves me an N for a potential -ING shot. VUGG is definitely a good option, but a 3 vowel draw could cripple me.
