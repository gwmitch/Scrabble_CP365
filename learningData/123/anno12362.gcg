>Doug_Brockmeier: EH 8H EH +10 10
>Jerry_Lerman: EEFILPR 9E PREFILE +75 75
#note PRELIFE at 7C or 9C scores 3 more and at G3 scores 76, but  I wasn't sure of PRELIFE being good.
>Doug_Brockmeier: AENOV 8K NOVAE +29 39
>Jerry_Lerman: AINOTUY M8 .AUNTY +26 101
#note YOU(R) at F6 - for only 15 points, but leaving the better leave AINT, wins the sim.  POUTY, YAUPON, PAYOUT, and YOU (for only 11) also outstrip my 26 point choice.
>Doug_Brockmeier: APRY 7I PRAY +31 70
>Jerry_Lerman: AIIOOTU E6 UTO.IA +16 117
#note This sims better than a variety of exchanges
>Doug_Brockmeier: BDNOS 12A BONDS +31 101
>Jerry_Lerman: EIKMMOR A12 .ORK +30 147
#note 8A IROKO for 42 (which I totally missed) is a clear winner, 10 points better than my 4th place 30 pt BORK.  (A)MMO at N8 for 30 is a couple better than BORK because of the superior leave IKER, I think. MIMEO at 8A is roughly equivalent to BORK
>Doug_Brockmeier: IJL 12J JIL. +22 123
>Jerry_Lerman: EIMMOOR 8A MIME. +30 177
#note There is a better way to score 30 points, and I saw the word, I just didn't see that it was playable to the R on the board:  MEMOIR at F4.  It sims about 5  points better than my MIMEO play.  Also better are 14A (R)OOMIER 22, F3 ROOMIE(R) 29, C9 MOO(N)IER 24 (which I considered but thought MIMEO was better), and 14A (R)OOMIE 20.

#note Nothing else comes close.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ADDGIN 15F ADDING +32 185
>Jerry_Lerman: AISSTUW N12 SAW +29 240
#note Sims best - and supposedly gives me a 72% winning likelihood.

>Doug_Brockmeier: ACENORS B2 SCENAR.O +74 259
#note Doug finds the only bingo with this nice rack (COARSEN, NARCOSE, CORNEAS,CANOERS)
>Jerry_Lerman: EIOSTTU 3B .UTE +12 252
#note With no options for scoring more than 18 points (COITUS), this is my first real problem rack.  I'll be behind after any play I make.  The best play according to sim is A4 OUT 11 - which I didn't consider.  I found what sims 3rd best - yielding a 26.8% winning chance.  What a difference Doug's bingo has made!
>Doug_Brockmeier: IIX N5 IXI. +27 286
>Jerry_Lerman: HINOSTT O13 HOT +32 284
#note 13-15 points better than HOT was A1 TOSH 51 points!   I guess I was too attached to retaining my S to consider it, although I had the S hook in mind when I played CUTE.  With both blanks unseen, the attachment to the S was unwarranted.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?BDELRU 4E RUmBLED +64 350
#note Doug had a 'zillion' bingos to play at 2E or 4E, all scored at least 65 points except for this one, scoring only 64 points.   Examples at 4E: DoUBLER - was 65 points.  At 2E, BLURTED or DURABLE score 67 and 66 respectively.  However, Doug's choice sims better than any of the alternatives in terms of winning % (77.5 vs 75.3 and lower)
>Jerry_Lerman: GIILNST 2E SILTING +65 349
#note Critical mistake here -- missed LIGNITES for 9 more points -  at O2.  I  thought of it while walking back to my car!  Somehow I could see it in my mind's eye, but not with my real eyes!
