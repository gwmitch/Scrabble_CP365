#note please don't ask me to explain what happened here. this is one of the stupidest things i've ever done on a scrabble board. i only went up to the challenge computer so that i could take a 1-minute walk.

#note 11I FETS/FEST gets me to the bingo faster. i didn't want to leave that spot open but maybe especially after ANE it's ok. (-9)

>cesar: ?EIOSTT 15A nOISETT. +74 271
#note i spent about 5 minutes looking for a 9 (and trying to calm down as i was playing ridiculously this game). if i'd seen eroticist i probably would not have tried it. (-14)

#note doper/roped are better. i had a one-track mind about trying to get rid of the F or the B. (-4.5)
>matt: OY 14B YO. +26 281
>cesar: EFGLPRS 3J PEG +15 337
#note i think PEG is fine even though it doesn't sim well. this is the most dangerous/probable bingo lane. quackle likes 11L FAG which has a lot of merits too with my SP- .. (-8.5)

#note i think this was my favorite play of natls.

>cesar: CEEHMOV A7 HOME +45 431
#note NOT a good endgame. A7 HEM setting up COVE is immensely better. i was super jittery and weird this game (see LIVY). also my S in FILS was sideways and i didn't even notice. stupid scrabble.

#note at least i made the right play here ;P

#note he coulda one tiled me with forestall/homed but i was speed playing near the end and i think he said he didn't track me correctly. i'd win by 6 with those plays
