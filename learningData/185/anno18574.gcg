>Josh: AAEERST K2 AERATES +72 93
>Josh: AAEERST --  -72 21
>Will_: EIINOPT 11C PION +18 62
#note Well, POINTIER is out now, nice to be able to dodge a nine-timer. This or maybe just ION is best against AERATES.
>Josh: AAEERST 12C ATE +16 37
>Will_: EEGIOTT B12 GOT +13 75
#note I didn't spot GOATEE. My play wasn't so hot - I wanted to keep things tight but couldn't find anything I liked that did that. Given that I might have opted to exchange instead.
>Josh: AEGR A12 AGER +30 67
>Will_: EEEHIST J6 HE.E +15 90
#note Josh had spent his original T, so I felt slightly better about this.
>Josh: AEEINST 5I ETESIAN +72 139
>Will_: AEINSTU L5 .INUATES +68 158
>Josh: JT N4 T.J +26 165

#note Let's get tricksy
>Josh: BILLOVY -  +0 165
>Will_: BIIIKLV 2K KILI. +22 225
#note I wanted to go for more tiles here without making a giant, easy spot with BILK.
>Josh: ?AIILOS 4C LIAISOn +65 230
>Will_: BDFISVY 11K B.VY +24 249
#note I can be patient.
>Josh: LORV E3 V.LOR +16 246
>Will_: DDFISWX C11 ..X +46 295
#note More patience
>Josh: DO 3L DO +13 259
>Will_: DDFIPSW O1 ......ID +39 334
#note That didn't feel as satisfying as I expected it would.
>Josh: EH F6 HE +28 287
>Will_: ACDFPSW C3 F.AW +20 354
#note Don't see a need to get aggressive with H1 CAPO/FADO  or N11 YAWP. Vowels are scarce so I thought about FLAWS instead for another crack at one but potential VALORS plays were too alluring.
>Josh: NU K11 .UN +7 294
>Will_: ?CDENPS 8A PENDS +39 393
>Josh: IQ B2 QI +27 321
>Will_: ?CCGLNO N10 C.CLO +36 429
#note Letting ZERO go through is in fact best, surprisingly - but CYNIC is better, following with B5 LOGE.
>Josh: ERRRTUZ H1 ZER. +39 360
