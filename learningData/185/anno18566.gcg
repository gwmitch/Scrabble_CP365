>JD: EIOPRSV --  -84 0
#note it's about to get ugly in a hurry! here I inexplicably play my collins bingo instead of taking another few seconds and finding PORKIES, drawing a minor chastising from joe.
>Joe_Edley: MNO K5 MON. +20 54
>JD: EIOPRSV L1 PROVE +30 30
#note his knowledge of my exact rack discourages me from fishing with something like OP.

#note I was a bit rattled and did not spot IONIZE!!

>JD: EIILSST --  -21 110
#note I have an incredible play here that I missed - ENLIST at 7J for 40 (spotting the potentialy for PROVENLY probaby would've led me to finding it). instead, I inexplicably played a collins 4, when another moment or two of thought would've reminded me that SEILING# is not TWL...

#note quackle wants me to play HIJAB and leave things open, but the biard is open enough that if he bingos on row 15 to the D I could actually still manage to lose

#note again cutting into his bingo percentage
>Joe_Edley: DEORSST N5 O.RSTEDS +61 302
#note well, I no longer feel so dumb about how I played this game after Edley missed a perfectly everyday disconnected 11
>JD: ?ACEGLN B6 CoNGEAL +75 411
#note unfortunately, for Joe, even if he does find S(IS)TER(HO)ODS last turn, I bingo on column N with ELEGANCE or something like that, so I guess it wasn't meant to be

#note hello, case blank, just to top off my outrageous good fortune

>JD: GU 15A GU. +12 452
#note I made my first two really massive errors of the tournament, but sometimes you've just gotta be a luckbox. an unusual number of artful plays that joe and I missed (PORKIES, ENLIST/PROVENLY and of course SISTERHOODS...)
