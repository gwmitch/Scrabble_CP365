#note Awesome - sweet opening rack.

>Rafi: ?BBLNNR 10C BL.N +8 67
#note My rack matures from Z? to BBLNRR?. Trading is weaker because not only is this leave not horrendous, but I'm also decreasing Cesar's average score next turn by a few points. NIB might even be better as it scores more and gives back less, but I run the risk of way more terrible racks.
>Cesar: AEILOTU C9 A.OUT +16 84
#note implying he has a strong leave
>Rafi: ?BNPRSS 12B P.BS +33 100
#note Played too fast... NUBS is obviously better as it sets up an S hook.
>Cesar: EILMNUY 13A MI.Y +20 104
#note didn't write my whole rack down but i think it was this - limey was right, maybe nu.
>Rafi: ?AENQRS -Q +0 100
#note Am I really supposed to play through??? I could never bring myself to play MEN/MAN when I have a 98% chance of bingoing next turn after exch. 1.
>Cesar: ?EEILNU B12 ..U +10 114
#note two can play this closed board game.. :P
>Rafi: ?AENORS G4 ANOR..iES +72 172
#note Happy to set up hotspots after a Cesarian fish. Probably my best find of the tournament!

>Cesar: AACEGIT J4 G.ACIATE +65 257
>Rafi: GIKORRU H11 RIGOR +26 246
#note I dislike KU, but this scores best and opens up much needed new lanes. I was choosing between this and KORE, and I don't like how KORE blocks lanes while leaving a leave nearly as undesirable as KU.
>Cesar: ADILNOS K9 LADINOS +76 333
#note i wonder if everyone was doing this to rafi. this was my only three-bingo combo (i don't even remember having a bingo-bango off the top of my head but i'm pretty sure i did). in vegas i had an irving, i still need to post that ridiculous game. in any case, let's get metaphysical here. why is it that everyone was doing this to rafi? why was i predestined to do this in this tournament, even though my record against him is pretty bad? (6-13 i believe prior to this game). same with the nigel p game. my record against him is pretty good - i believe something along the lines of 4-1 or 5-1 -- but he's at nationals now where he always cashes and he never has done something to me like mestiza/shantih back to back -- what's up with that? 
>Rafi: DFHIKPU L12 FUD +29 275
#note I can't even hit the triple with this rack! I was debating between this and PEH, and I decided to keep a semi-synergic leave + opening a lane instead of 8 more points leaving DFIKU. I guess I should probably play PEH though, as I can hit SKIFF for 60! That's easily my best route rack into this (stupid) game.
>Cesar: DDEERTW F2 DEW.D +34 367
#note (To remove WED from?).  Equity doesn't matter here -- DEW may have significantly more equity (about 8) but the plays are basically tied on win % (DEWED with a slight edge) .. and DEWED is pretty clearly best.
>Rafi: HIKOOPY 4J .OOKY +28 303
#note Maybe I can play GOPIK instead... I actually wasn't sure of the non-S-hook but if I was I might have had a small chance of baiting an S-hook or sneaking a GOPIKS* bingo by.
>Cesar: EEFIORT M11 EFT +27 394
#note missed the star play of OFTER in the same spot. most likely focus issues/etc. working on that. (-9)
>Rafi: EHIPQRT -Q +0 303
#note I seemed like my only shot was to exch. Q and go for GRAPHITE and... PHRAT(R)IE(S)! This would have been such a sick fish if it worked... if GRAPHITE is blocked then I can mayyyybe win with PHRATRIES plus a Q stick as there is only one place to dump QI.
>Cesar: EEIIORT M1 TRI.E +18 412
#note or tike which i wasn't 100% on. -1.5
>Rafi: EHIPRTV 10J ..V +6 309
#note HIV(E) hits some 9s through R-S too. I'm hoping for a miracle here... but mostly resigned to going for cutting spread and gaining style points. P(A) will never work.
