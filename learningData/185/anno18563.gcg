#note i think H11 EIGHT is ok here. yes it would suck if he has a bingo but i can likely get one back. GID cuts his bingo percentage very much though but it's down like 6% in win%... maybe because i might not be able to outrun something like ADVENTS?

#note i wanted to just play 10B HO but look my spread is like -200 and i just need to win games. yes i was fairly certain there's no way he could bingo out but i wasn't 100% on it. if i'm going for spread and i haven't lost a lot of games i would play it. so lots of equity loss here but i assure the win. -23
