>Will: GJNNOSY 7C JO.N +21 85
#note A few competitive options here...I was pretty close to doing SYN but figured I get a fair amount more bingos down after JOIN (sim says 17%) and ARIA makes him slightly likelier to have low point tiles. 
>Scott: IIIII -IIIII +0 54
>Will: GLNOSTY 2J YON +27 112
#note I realize that adding an N improves GLST as a leave but it's still five consonants and there's no open vowels to dump through on this board.
>Scott: ?AALRSU L2 .AtURALS +66 120
>Will: EGLOPST 3I TEP.L +26 138
#note I had PUG on the board and I picked it up to play this, and I'm glad I did. STOLE is a decent but not great leave and the board is not great for it.
>Scott: CMO 3A COM. +35 155
>Will: GGOSSTY F6 S..GGY +21 159
#note Better than SOGGY to preserve 1A STOKE with an E draw with 8 of them to come.

#note Way off, and I think I had plenty of time to figure it out/do the math. I missed EIDE anyway.
