#note Evans is a bingoing fool, so I always favour words that don't take hooks a gainst hin.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW H6 WH.RFiNG +68 68
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW --  -68 0
#note No idea if he thought it was good or was just trying to punk me.
>Winter: ILLLNOR 7H NOIL +15 29
#note Quackle hates this, but I could not risk giving him any tiles to play through, definitely not a wowel.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?FGHNRW J6 W..H +18 18
>Winter: DDDILLR 9J .ILD +10 39
#note Meanwhile I'm drawing crap, but I decide that (H)ILD is worth, both because I think it doesn't take an ess, and also because Evans thinks I don't know any words and tends to challenge a lot of what I play.

Quackle disfavours it by 5 points, but I in fact did get the plus 5.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAAA -AAAA +0 18
#note I like this, and would feel confident, EXCEPT...
>Winter: AADDLRW 6J .ADD +11 50
#note ...I continue to draw crap!!!

I'm surprised I missed this, because after half a lifetime of "experiences", I've learned to be wery good at WITHDRAWAL.

#note +5
>Evans_Clinchy: ?MNORSY 10D MaSONRY +93 123
#note Figured it was coming sooner or later.
>Winter: EELNSTZ 9C ZEL +27 120
#note Technically, I missed NERTZ, but I wasn't really looking up there, because blocking the board is a priority against Evans and his bingoing prowess.
>Evans_Clinchy: ACMU 11B CAUM +29 152
>Winter: EILNSTT M1 SENT +26 146
#note Again, I factor the +5 into my calculations when deciding on this play, and I get it.

Quackle hates this. Wants me to play (A)T for 4, to fish, open a line, rather than taking the lead and trying to keep the board tight.

No way, not against Evans.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAJ I1 .AJA +19 171
>Winter: ILNOOQT 4H Q.T +22 168
#note It was fun to see the look on his face every time I blocked an opening (yes, I realise that LAM is still there, but I can't do anything about it).

Once again, Quackle wants me to open the board. We need a wersion of Quackle that knows how to play against a superior bingoing opponent.

#note Ach!!!

On the other hand, blogging that X spot pays off later.
>Evans_Clinchy: FGIT A12 GIFT +42 284
#note Ugh.
>Winter: ?EEEGOT C6 GEE. +15 247
#note Appropriate, given what I'm thinking when I see my draws.
>Evans_Clinchy: BEPY L8 B.YPE +30 314
#note Hurm.
>Winter: ?EOPSTU O4 SPOUTEd +82 329
#note I did consider not bingoing and playing UP (Quack likes UPO), but the bag did not instill confidence that I would bingo next turn.

Which I hadn't missing the better spot, though--that kind of taints this whole game.
>Evans_Clinchy: BIIORSX 12E BRIO +14 328
>Winter: ADEEK M12 DEEK +21 350
#note +5

This is satisfying because Evans likes to mock how I don't know bingos, and I won the game, despite the crappy draws, on his challenges of short words.
