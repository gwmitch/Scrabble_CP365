#note DEFENCE(E)s, which I saw but didn't think was good.  Apparently Q likes CDE? blank over CEN?, I took the two extra points.

#note CENTEs(I)M(O) 1B, jeeeeeeez.  I had the right idea playing off ME, but (HO)ME H7 is 6 more points.  -6.

#note I didn't even consider using the blank that turn, so I missed all the 70 point J plays, otherwise this is fine.

#note Q does't want me to Bingo, but since so many spots were all ready open to score with, I felt like this was a fine play.
