#note I had a lot of time for this play, and I spent it well. The first option I saw, well before he made NAZI, was of course LOCUSTAE 2A, but that obviously lost to some draws, all of them with the Q. EQ, HQ, and QV all lose, and he is probably less likely to have kept the Q with NAZI because he blocked a QI spot, though he could still definitely have it. I figured if I was going to pass up a bingo, I would need to A) Block the EX spot at B9 and B) Deal with Q draws, probably by keeping the U. Thus I realized I would need to make a play on column C. It seemed like such a play would put me up enough to win if I didn't draw the Q, which appears correct, and the question is, how well does it do in Q endgames compared to LOCUSTAE? I knew LOCUSTAE lost with QV, and I was pretty sure it lost other endgames but not able to calculate for sure. It seemed like my best bet was to keep AEU to make scoring with the Q easy (keeping just EU with something like TAO C8 could lead to disaster), and I wanted to keep the CL rather than the CT because of CLAQUE. Though keeping ACUTE allows me to play TEACUP, that's really not such a great play if I hold the Q anyway, so I decided ACELU would be at least as good of a leave, and might potentially win me more games than ACETU. Thus I arrived at TO. Unfortunately, I couldn't calculate endgames precisely, and looking at Quackle reveals that TO still loses if I draw QV. As it turns out, I don't even need to block the X spot, though. If I play IT 5D (thanks to Kenji for finding this play), I draw into COEQUAL if I get the Q, which he can't block without sacrificing too much. Even if he plays VET(S) and saves EX/HEX for next turn, I have a few winning plays. If instead he has the Q, he has to play QAT because otherwise I can Q stick him and win by a landslide. As it turns out, QAT plays always lose for him if I play optimally, though I do have to find some hard plays in those endgames, like (S)AU/(S)AUL 2F after QAT and a V draw for me.
