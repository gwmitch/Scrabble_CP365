#note tympan takes so many hooks that just dropping the E sims great, but that sim is screwed up because the board sucks. i totally missed JANTY. -4

>cesar: EGGIILP C8 .IGGLE +18 213
#note does QI imply a great leave? TUNED maybe was consonant heaviness. no idea what to play here. NIGGLE sims best for whatever that means. (well, basically tied with FIZGIG which i am not ever going to play here)

#note -1.5 LOOIE 14F - i like it better now. i want a blank or S and to add some uglier specificity to the lane.

#note an out in two with a twist. i needed to get my endgame skillz out here that i hadn't used all tournament because i kept getting beat by 240.
