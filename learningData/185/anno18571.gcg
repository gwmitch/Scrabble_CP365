>Jesse_Matthews: BLNORUU 8F BLUR +12 12
#note I considered 8H ULU, and didn't like the leave on BOURN. Quackle also suggests that exchanging BLOUU is potentially better.
>Chris_Lipe: ?EEEMOT I2 TElOME.E +62 62
>Jesse_Matthews: CGHNOPU 4H G.UNCH +26 38
#note H1 PUH# doesn't leave me with the most ideal of racks. I think I have the right idea here with trying to declutter, but 4H PLOUGH accomplishes the same and an improved leave.
>Chris_Lipe: NR H7 N.R +7 69
>Jesse_Matthews: DLNOPTV J9 VOLT +15 53
#note He's clearly sitting on good letters. Only J1 VODUN sims higher than this, but VODUN is probably better not just for the few extra points but also because it doesn't give up a potential 2x2 or the extremely easy-to-hook VOLT with A, E, I or S.
>Chris_Lipe: ADEEINR 11E RENAI.ED +86 155
>Jesse_Matthews: ADIKNPU H1 KIN. +31 84
#note 13I KIDNAP is the highest simming option due to the 44 it scores. I'm not sure I like it. Besides it, however, there are a number of Collins-only options that I did not know and are all far better than my play (H11 ADUKI#, 13I PIKAU, M3 KHUD). If I'd known them, I probably would have ended up playing H11 ADUKI# over 13I KIDNAP, despite the point difference. I prefer what ADUKI# does for the board.
>Chris_Lipe: AHI 10E AHI +31 186
>Jesse_Matthews: ADEGIPU H11 .GAPE +30 114
#note Another position where my lack of Collins knowledge shows. 13I GAUPED# sims highest, but even if I knew it I wouldn't play it. I don't like what it does to shut down the board. I like H11 APAID# best, but did not know it. It accomplishes what I wanted to do with AGAPE, but a few more points and a better leave.
>Chris_Lipe: CEIY L11 .ICEY +30 216
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEIIOU 3M OI +14 128
#note Didn't know DIECIOUS at all, and it's even TWL. Whoops.
>Chris_Lipe: EOW 15L .OWE +30 246
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEFIRU 12A FRIED +30 158
#note More lack of Collins knowledge hurting me here. K1 REINFUND# is best. My play and G13 FUD sim close behind, but not even a 10% chance of winning at this point.
>Chris_Lipe: AOZ G13 ZOA +49 295
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EILOQU O1 ObLIQUE +101 259
#note This is an extraordinarily unusual position. There are 4 esses, 2 Rs and 2 Ds currently unseen with only 37 tiles left to play in the game, so playing OBLIQUE as I did is extremely dangerous. However, it actually sims best! A8 QUOIF# sims lower and so does B7 LIQUORED. My reasoning for OBLIQUE is that I'm losing huge anyway, spread doesn't matter too much to me at this point because I have a lot of it, so why not play for a miracle win?
>Chris_Lipe: IMOO N6 MOOI +24 319
>Jesse_Matthews: AAAADFV O1 .......D +60 319
#note Incredibly, he doesn't have ANY of the letters to hook my bingo with! Tie game after this play.
>Chris_Lipe: ATUY B10 YU.TA +32 351
>Jesse_Matthews: AAAAFLV A7 FAVA +35 354
#note Given the consonant heavy pool, I perhaps should have played FLAVA# for the three extra points. My play sims higher, however.
>Chris_Lipe: EJP 14J JE.P +33 384
>Jesse_Matthews: AAEILNS K1 ALA.INES +66 420
#note Quackle suggests play 13L CAIN. I don't see the reasoning for this at all. I'll take the points, thanks, and with that, empty the bag and leave us both with 7 consonant racks!
>Chris_Lipe: GNST 14A G.NTS +6 390
>Jesse_Matthews: BDRSTWX 1J W.X +21 441
>Chris_Lipe: RST 8A .RTS +5 395
#note And thus concludes the most absurd game I played in Buffalo. Apologies to Chris who was a good sport.
