#note Best - best score. 
>Alan: ANOTU G5 TOU.AN +10 10
>James: EEFGLOT D3 GOLFE. +22 96
#note GOLFED is decently defensive, scores close to best and leaves a good ET leave. DEFOG D8 is also worth considering, since ELT is not a bad leave either. Quackle likes FLOTAGE E4, likely because it blocks up F6, but it also creates another spot at E11. 
>Alan: ?AEEITV J2 VEAlIE.T +70 80
>James: AAETTUY F5 AY +28 124
#note Best. Scores well, and takes up one of the more dangerous spots. 
>Alan: BDEEINR K9 INBREED +72 152
>James: AEORTTU 15D OUTRATE. +80 204
#note About even between OUTTRADE 15E and OUTRATED. I like this one slightly more because it isn't possible to hook this word, but it makes 14J a dangerous hotspot. 
>Alan: DEIJL 4I J.ILED +28 180
>James: AABEIKS L1 KIE.BASA +70 274
#note I missed IKEBANAS 10B and may have taken that instead. It's more defensive for 2 less points and I already have the lead. I got lazy, again. 
>Alan: AY 14I AY. +29 209
>James: FGILOSX 13F GOLF +23 297
#note FLEX 13I is favored most. I'm not sure why I picked GOLF - maybe it's because I wanted the X for something in the future? 
>Alan: EIIOPRS 10B RIPIE.OS +64 273
>James: DIOSTVX 9A VOX +40 337
#note Best - very efficient blocking play with good points. 
>Alan: CMW 14B CWM +24 297
>James: DEILRST M8 TIRLED +18 355
#note Chickened out of TIDDLERS N1/N2. I thought TIRLED M8 would be the best way to at least block the bingos, but it doesn't seem to reflect that. IDLE M1, DEIL M3, etc. are all found to be better by Quackle. I just liked the play that will block up the bingo lanes if I can't find anything else. 
>Alan: NOW 1L .NOW +33 330
>James: AIMNQSZ 12C NIZAM +39 394
#note I decided to take points and work to outrun Alan with my remaining tiles, playing off 1 at a time. After all, maybe he won't block up QI. 
>Alan: ?EHINOU 6F ..U +6 336
#note ... or maybe he will. 
>James: EHNOQRS 3L .H +20 414
#note Time to play this slowly...
