>Matthew_Larocque: EHNOSST H4 HOTNESS +78 78
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 3. Up until then I was 3-0 against Shannon, which is more than I deserve. I had to try and extend that streak to win the tournament. An opening bingo sure helped my chances!
>Shannon_Burns: ACILNN 5D CANN.LI +18 18
#note Shannon said this was supposed to be a trap, because he thought it didn't take an S. But it does!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIOTW 10F WI.ED +21 99
#note This play gave me trouble. My choice doesn't sim very well - Quackle likes plays that dump OW, or DOWIE 6J for 22. I had no idea DOWIE was an adjective!
>Shannon_Burns: INOV 11C VINO +19 37
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEOOT 12D TOEA +20 119
#note A(L)OE for 15 is pretty good too.
>Shannon_Burns: AJR 13G RAJ +22 59
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGMOU D2 GUA.O +16 135
#note Wow, MOUlAGE. MEOU is pretty neat played underneath RAJ.
>Shannon_Burns: STXY 4J XYST +37 96
#note Pretty agressive, but he still thought S-hooking CANNOLI was invalid.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEELM 11I DEEM +20 155
#note Yikes, I thought MEED wasn't a word! Otherwise I would have played it for 27. MEED competes with the bingo of E(N)aMELED for best play.
>Shannon_Burns: FGNO 3C F.NGO +20 116
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIILRR N2 RoILIER +81 236
>Shannon_Burns: AMU 8L MU.A +27 143
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIITUZ 12J ETUI +22 258
#note TE(G)UA for 28 sets up my Z pretty good!
>Shannon_Burns: PPU 9K PUP +21 164
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHIIWZ 2B ZI. +31 289
#note I saw WHIZ for 44 and decided I could probably net more points with ZI(G) keeping a useable rack next turn. Quackle still says WHIZ.
>Shannon_Burns: EY 7L EY. +27 191
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHILOW O1 HEW +33 322
#note AWHILE 14B seems like a bad idea....
>Shannon_Burns: AEIORSV 14I OVARIES +95 286
#note That hurt!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIKLO M1 KIL. +29 351
#note I can't even do anything on the bottom row (unless I burn my blank.... meh)! Quackle wants me to forgo the points and play OAK 14E to screw up that bottom row.
>Shannon_Burns: BEGL 15F GLEB +33 319
#note Wow Shannon, playing a phony 4! I was unsure of this but I thought I'd be able to outscore him at this point.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACEOR O12 CA.E +27 378
#note CA(S)A
>Shannon_Burns: F 2L F... +7 326
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AABDOR G7 AB +12 390
#note BROADAx(E) 83! ADORABl(E) too. My clock was in the 30 second range or so, sadly. So nice of me to give him a Q dump! I still think I can't tack an S on CANNOLI.
>Shannon_Burns: QRT 7E TR..Q +24 350
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADOR J3 O..Ds +30 420
#note Yeah... I can go out with any number of words.... tARDO 8A for 23 is the top play.
>Shannon_Burns: DNOT 6B TO.N +9 359
#note His best move is D(A)TO O7.
>Matthew_Larocque: AR G2 R.A. +9 429
>Matthew_Larocque:  (D) +4 433
#note Overscored R(O)A(N) by 1, then lost 10 points on the timer.
