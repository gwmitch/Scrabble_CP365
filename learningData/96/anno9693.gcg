>Bruce: ADKNR H8 DRANK +30 30
>James: ?EEGOTU 11F TO.GUE +14 14
#note Interesting play here - EGO I9 is one that gives ETU?, which is slightly less volatile but it does leave a U. I decided the one more point was worth it. 
>Bruce: ADORR L9 ARDOR +21 51
>James: ?DEIMOO M3 MOIDOrE +75 89
#note Best - points are worth it here. 
>Bruce: AEQU 13I QUA.E +48 99
>James: EGINNNO L1 NEON +18 107
#note I think it's best - ING is a good leave and there's not many ways to play off two Ns on this board. NOON 4L does for 8 less, but EGIN isn't much stronger than GIN. 
>Bruce: EJ 2J JE. +26 125
>James: CGINOUW 14F COWING +38 145
#note Tricky play - COWING leaves me open to a lot of playback, but my hand has nothing worthwhile otherwise. As such, it's probably best to take the points and see what happens. After all, it will take an S or two to bingo along the bottom. 
>Bruce: AADLN 15K ALAND +25 150
>James: IIOORSU 15H OS +33 178
#note Tough situation. Is it better to play OI 14N for 11, OS 15H for 33, or exchange IIOU? OS is favored sheerly for the sake of points but perhaps exchanging or OI isn't so bad - the game is even and having the OS means that if an H or M is drawn, it makes playing along the bottom worthwhile. Thus, maybe OI is worth it, though IORSU isn't amazing period. 
>Bruce: ILPU 12C PULI +14 164
>James: BIIORUZ K4 ORIBI +17 195
#note Interesting - BI 13B allows a setup of ZORI A12, which could come in handy. It's not likely to see a huge play by Bruce on this board except a bingo, which wouldn't likely go there, so I like BI for that reason. ORIBI is the one play to clear the rack, though UZ is not that great to hold onto. BRIO 3G and BIO 3H are interesting plays as well, in order to perhaps get the Z into play another way.  
>Bruce: ABHT J6 BAHT +34 198
>James: AELTUYZ I1 LAZY +37 232
#note PUT allows for a possible play of LAZY 15A, though that's kind of a giveaway and he is more likely to have Ts than he did have Os last turn (as I had the case O). Overall, I like LAZY. 
>Bruce: AENV 1E VENA. +24 222
>James: EEFILTU 14M TUI +16 248
#note I thought to play TUI so as to dump the U for now, as I still had the F to perhaps play FE 2F or some -IFY 6+. Quackle likes FE first, though. 
>Bruce: CERSW 4D SCREW. +36 258
>James: EEEFGLS 2F FE +28 276
#note I picked this for the points, which Quackle agrees with. It's getting progressively harder to ensure a bingo, since I have got the lion's share of the Es. 
>Bruce: ETX 1L .EXT +33 291
>James: EEEGLST 13B GET +18 294
#note This was a touch rack - maybe GEE 13A for 2 points less? I think I was paranoid about the blank and its potential to win the game. It may have been somewhat placed with the Is in the bag, but that would mean the blank is likely an N. 

Quackle also picks GET first. 
>Bruce: ?HIIMSY G13 Y.M +17 308
>James: AEEHLPS E4 .HEEP +24 318
#note By this point, I'm fairly sure that an S and a blank are in Bruce's hand with a bunch of consonants. The last plays infer the following:

1) at NEXT, Bruce had either one I or none. This is because otherwise, he'd play NIXE. This is regardless of if he had one or two Ts, because if he looks in the bag there are a lot of Es and Is unseen to him one way of the other (esp since I had three Es at one point). 

2) YOM is still a good indication that more Is are in the bag. If there weren't I would think some other play to play off Is would've been taken, be it VIRID or something else to get out of the game faster. 

Thus, from both, it is important to think of whether or not one would fine Is in the bag. To that end, Quackle like playing off as many tiles as possible to get a good out in two and recommends CHEAP, which I think is a definite loss if the F is out there (since RIFS will win the game in most circumstances) but I think CHAPEL E4 is a great idea since ES, drawing 2, is likely to get somewhere since one tile is very likely to be an S. 

My thought with my play was only to try and stop an 8A play, since I thought a V play along that row would be enough to win the game, but even though I thought about the F I forgot about it when thinking further. 
>Bruce: ?FIIIRT F6 FRIT +34 342
>James: ALSSV 7A SLAV..S +12 330
#note And I lose as such. With chapel, I'd have ESSV, which means it'd still be hard to win. 
>James:  (II?) +4 334
