>James: IIMSTUW 8G WIT +12 12
#note Exchanging IUW is favored by Quackle and I think it's right in this case. IMST has good mobility as a leave, at least, far more than IMSU. 
>Mike: ELNORRS -ELNOR +0 0
>James: BDIMSUZ 7H BUM +15 27
#note Quackle likes DITZ I6, which is fairly surprising to me, though not by much at all. It, BUD/BIZ/BUM/MUD 7H, and DUMBS J4 all are about the same. I guess it's trying to figure out what's better, a U or a Z. Personally, I think playing BUM is more favorable because it likely will give me a way to play the Z next turn (perhaps SIZED K7 with the right draw, or lesser). 
>Mike: EEIIN G8 .EINIE +11 11
#note Bad, but it's worth letting go for now, because... 
>James: BDEIOSZ 12D IOD.ZE +52 79
#note I have this! Plus, I can use that lane most likely for sure and if he plays on it I can challenge. 
>Mike: ACET 6I CATE +19 30
>James: BFIORSS 10F F.BROSIS +73 152
#note Best - least openings made with best score. 
>Mike: IINO 11F I.ION +31 61
#note Beautiful play by Mike. 
>James: AEJNPRU 5J JUN +38 190
#note Quackle likes JUPE 5J but JUN I think is better for two main reasons.

1) JUN can't be hooked onto except for the K. That makes the top right, for all intensive purposes, very hard to bingo on. 

2) the P is very useful for a potential play at E11. It would also help to block up the bottom part of the board. 
>Mike: AEK 9L KAE +17 78
>James: AEGGLPR 8M GAG +21 211
#note I like this play, mostly because I hold onto the P again and this blocks up the bingo lane. GAP 8M is also worth considering. 
>Mike: ADEX 4L AXED +34 112
>James: DEILNPR 3L PERI +41 252
#note Quackle likes plays like PILED 3J more, ostensibly for leave, but I preferred PERI since that would just give me another area to block up well. It did cost me my dear P, though. 
>Mike: ELY 2M LEY +35 147
>James: DELNORS 14A RONDELS +80 332
#note And so I get to play. As it is, even if it gets challenged off, it'd be a LOT of work for Mike to come back at this point. 

Mike really didn't look happy after this. As it is, maybe something like RONDO J9, encouraging Mike to try WEINIES for my own challenge, would take the day, as I give him a 3-3, perhaps the only way for him to come back on this board. Quackle thinks so, at least. 
>Mike: ?AENRUW A7 UNWARiE. +80 227
#note UNWEARIED D6 would be cute! 
>James: AGHRSTT B2 GARTHS +38 370
#note Best - points, doesn't leave any hugely dangerous openings (3-3s), and runs the bag out faster. 
>Mike: CHOUV 3B .VOUCH +36 263
>James: ADIMOTY E11 M.T.Y +36 406
#note DOM[INION] 11C is so cute! And a better leave than MOTEY for just 4 less. OY B9 is also a strong play, though there is little way for Mike to use B10 given that there's nothing left in the bag for him to use. 

As it is, these plays pretty much all guarantee my win, so just make sure not to play anything wrong and it should all be good. 
>Mike: EOQT E2 Q.OTE +28 291
>James: ADILOOP L9 ..LO +16 422
#note One off of HAPLOID 1G, but whatever. This was to block off SERVANT as a possibility. 
>Mike: ?AAEFLN 1K ELF +21 312
>James: ?AADIOP 7D ODA +20 442
>Mike: ANRTV 10A .VA +14 326
