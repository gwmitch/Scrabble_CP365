>Betty_Cornelison: ANV 8G VAN +12 12
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 4. I was looking forward to this rematch because of how badly I botched the first game with her. Things didn't quite work out like I hoped!
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIKNS J6 KNEED +31 31
#note Argh, I should have found SKEINED - I didn't know the anagram of that word which scores the most points here.
>Betty_Cornelison: ALOTV K2 VOLTA +22 34
>Matthew_Larocque: FHIJSTW 3J H.WF +26 57
#note "heh heh I played that word last game!"
>Betty_Cornelison: ?EEINRS 11E INvERSE +85 119
>Betty_Cornelison: ?EEINRS --  -85 34
#note Well then
>Matthew_Larocque: AIJLSTU N1 JUS +34 91
#note Having seen her letters, and having no way to block everything, this seemed like a good gamble!
>Betty_Cornelison: ?EEINRS L6 ESERINe +71 105
#note She had a cluster of 74 pointers with that central A.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILRTY 1L TA. +11 102
#note Wow, if this really was my rack.... I deserved to lose! "Hm I didn't draw an O, I guess I need to block that J now" -_-
>Betty_Cornelison: AEZ 4H ZEA. +28 133
>Matthew_Larocque: AILORTY H1 RIT.Y +51 153
>Betty_Cornelison: U 11L .U +2 135
#note She pondered a long time...
>Matthew_Larocque: ABELMOT 5D LAMB. +24 177
#note Now I'm pondering a long time.... she must have a killer rack. I thought about T(U)MBLE but that would probably just make things much worse....decided to just take some points and hope to get a decent counter if she bingos down the N column. Some words I didn't know here such as EMBOLY OBLATE LOBATE. Q once again is nuts about that        -ABLE leave.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?CINOOR D3 CO.ORINg +70 205
#note Hm well that makes things harder. She also had a 77 point play from the central A. 
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIOORT F2 DOO. +11 188
#note Not a lot of choices here - decided to take a gamble and see if I can grab the other Y.
>Betty_Cornelison: DGO K11 GOD +19 224
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIPRT 7H PI. +13 201
#note Still can't find anything good to play.....this does reasonably good in the sim - EPI(C) finishes at the top, but I'm not sure how wise that is. Then again I'm fishing for (DOOM)Y so what do I know about being wise!
>Betty_Cornelison: GU G8 .UG +8 232
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIRTU M3 .EU +6 207
#note (E)E(R)IE but I don't want the U
>Betty_Cornelison: AO 2J A.O +22 254
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIQRTX C8 QI +26 233
>Betty_Cornelison: GIM 11E MIG +21 275
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRTX 8L .XIT +33 266
#note Yeah EX J13 keeps such a good leave I'll probably bingo - this is probably a bigger mistake than it seems.
>Betty_Cornelison: EORST H11 STORE +25 300
#note She was hesitant on this, thinking it would give me some kind of big counter-play or something.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRRY 6B IR.NY +39 305
#note Yay... 41% to win with this
>Betty_Cornelison: BDE G13 BED +21 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEEFR B9 REFACE +29 334
#note Ouch... I used up all my remaining time (which couldn't have been much), but I missed the killer play here for 51 points. This sims second although it's still basically a toss up. I had no idea if I'd win or lose (but I was feeling a loss coming, emptying the bag often has that effect).
>Betty_Cornelison: EILLPSW 12A P.WL +24 345
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEHNT F13 AH +32 366
#note Heh, playing HE or HA A14 for 20 points is better just to block her out play.
>Betty_Cornelison: EILS 15A ISLE +27 372
>Betty_Cornelison:  (AENT) +8 380
