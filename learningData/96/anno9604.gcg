>Noah: AEEIRTU 15A .EU +3 300
#note This play definitely caught me off guard.
>dacrON: DJNRRTW I2 J.R.T +15 300
#note considered exchanging, but with the Q out and stuff, and both being low on time, I decided to force the issue. Somehow, I'm actually in this game. but seriously, can I PLEASE get an E this game?
>Noah: AEIIKRT A8 KEA +29 329
#note well that sucks.
>dacrON: DEILNRW 8A .NEW +15 315
#note An E!!!!!!! But argh, out of time here. He obviously didnt have the Q after LEU, so I figured, if I can snag the S and he has the Q, maybe I can pull this out, but I don't see much else, especially with 30 seconds on my clock. Comments appreciated here. What to do?
>Noah: IIQRSTT C4 TRIT. +6 335
#note TRIST(E) is 4 better, but this is a nice play.
