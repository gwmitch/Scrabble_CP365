>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEIPS 8C APIECE +26 26
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 7. Desperate for a win, but I'm playing Juraj so I'm not expecting one.....Q likes this for 22 at 8D. Is defense that big a deal here?
>Juraj_Pivovarov: JO F6 JO. +26 26
>Matthew_Larocque: BEGIMRS C7 G.MB +14 40
#note I didn't know GAMBIERS but I should have played one of the other two, sheesh. Need to try harder with these high point letters. Really no excuses here, just lazy and bad.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: FINO G3 INFO +17 43
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIRSX 4D EXI.E +26 66
#note If I don't draw a bingo, can fall back on the R hook (hopefully).
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEIT D8 .IETA +22 65
>Matthew_Larocque: EEPRSVZ C2 PERV +31 97
#note I don't think I should test the waters with C12 ZEP, I like this play a lot better even though the sim disagrees.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: MUY B1 YUM +28 93
>Matthew_Larocque: AENRSWZ C12 ZA +33 130
#note Really, at B6? Even for me that's a bit too reckless..... 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EEILOT A3 ETOILE +26 119
#note Completely thought he was getting a bingo as he was putting this down.
>Matthew_Larocque: ENORSSW I4 SNOW +25 155
#note Unthinkable. I outdid my own previous blunder. I had the rack arranged as SNOWERS which obviously isn't a word. I couldn't think of any other combination..... -_- 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AGG E10 GAG +33 152
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEQRSS 3F Q. +22 177
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AFTU 9H TUFA +10 162
#note He missed FA for 30, which he brought up after and said was a big error. Not quite as severe as my spotty bingo-finding abilities though!
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENRSS F11 ES +19 196
#note Hate racks like these, where you're forced to fish off an S for below average points. Missed S(E)E for 21. Sim likes EAS(E) in the same spot for 24. Eh, wanted to keep 2 vowels.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AHRTW 8K THRAW +47 209
#note Hm, never saw this one until now. Takes an N hook too!
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENRST 10J AN +14 210
#note This is what I have written down as my rack, but I'm seriously questioning it. I know I'm playing like a novice, but there's positively no way I would forget SANTERA. The most basic of the basics. Perhaps I had TANNERS and missed the spot for it? I don't know, this is one miserable game. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DKNU 11H DUNK +40 249
#note And that ended up being an extremely bad place to dump my letters.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELNRST 14C SALTERN +71 281
#note Played instead of STERNAL for defense. 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: INOR 15D NOIR +14 263
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDHLRY N7 H.RDLY +17 298
#note Lucky break.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BO 12L BO. +16 279
>Matthew_Larocque: ??DILUV 13K VID +24 322
#note I wasn't totally sure if UNLIVED was good, and there's DIVULge(R) which I never would have seen or been sure of. Played it safe and hoped I could still pull it out - I sure am making it look hard to win with 8 power tiles! Hilariously VID sims better than the bingos, presumably because he has an outside chance to bingo out...
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CEIS O12 SICE +31 310
>Matthew_Larocque: ??ADLOU H11 .Or.s +27 349
#note Several bingos work here, the most notable being OLDsqUA(W) for 85. I didn't have any time left to find a bingo, so zeroed in on the TWS and played something for 27 points....
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIORT M3 RIOTE. +20 330
#note He did hold for a bit, but just played out. Hey, I've lost games before by playing bad phonies at pivotal moments!
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (ADLU) +10 340
#note I've also won games after playing like a mentally deficient person....
