>Wayne_Clifford: IJNOS 8D JOINS +40 40
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 6. I managed to pick up a whopping 1 blank in my first five games - so I don't feel too bad about bombing here. Worst tournament record ever!
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIIOSW 7F BIO +15 15
#note I could have played BOW for 25, but it's easy enough for him to underlap that and hit me right back. Quackle also likes WI(N)O just below this.
>Wayne_Clifford: GOX 9C GOX +31 71
>Matthew_Larocque: AISTTWY D8 ..TTY +30 45
#note Can't do anything great with (OX)Y, well there's YAW, but this is worth 30 points...
>Wayne_Clifford: AC 12B CA. +8 79
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILRSW 6H WAIL +15 60
#note Akward rack and board. Figured this balances and gives my S somewhere to go. Sim agrees, (T)WIRL second.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACEILNS L6 SANICLE +78 157
#note Yep
>Matthew_Larocque: GIIKRRS 10J RI.K +12 72
#note I spent an extremely long time here. Like 8 minutes or something. I thought there had to be a way to score better and keep a balanced leave. Did I see IRK M11 for 18? The sim is a big mess with that IRK play leading and a bunch of plays dumping GIR. Not sure about trying to bingo with that K.....so many crappy options this game!
>Wayne_Clifford: ILN M10 .ILN +20 177
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIRSZ 8J ZI.GER +48 120
#note Finally getting on the scoreboard.
>Wayne_Clifford: ENPT I10 PENT +20 197
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIOSSV O4 SAVO.IES +62 182
#note I'll admit I pretty much guessed, and put on my poker face. Turns out its fine, and it's the only bingo. Yay!
>Wayne_Clifford: MO 10D .OM +21 218
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIMNTU H11 FAINT +37 219
#note Torn between this or MUFTI(S), but decided I should keep the board friendly for bingos and just keep hammering high scores to put pressure on him. Didn't know MU(C)IN or FANUM, but I think FAINT is worth the points.
>Wayne_Clifford: EHO G13 HOE +24 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDMRTU N2 DRUB +20 239
#note Dunno, should I leave the S alone? Sim likes DUMB N12 which I don't think I saw. I took out the open S, thinking I could try for a bingo ending in T. 
>Wayne_Clifford: AFG N12 FAG +22 264
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EHMNTU F14 HM +34 273
#note Yikes, I draw a bingo ending in T, but it's totally beyond my capabilities here.
>Wayne_Clifford: EEQU 3J QUEE. +28 292
#note Now I'm really desperate for that hook.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EENTTU J10 .UT +12 285
#note Barf. I took quite awhile to spot this. It sims best, but that's not much consolation....
>Wayne_Clifford: AA 5I AA +6 298
#note *Shakes fist at Wayne*
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EENRTY O1 YE +18 303
#note I guess I have to play something  at L1, but maybe I can outscore him still....if I actually remember to count my plays!
>Wayne_Clifford: EOW O13 WOE +27 325
#note Ok I lose...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENRT L2 R.E +6 309
#note (Missed my whole rack - time trouble) Maybe he can't block this! Seemed like a good last ditch effort! Without the blank,  P(REE) is the only hook he could have now, right?
>Wayne_Clifford: ?ADER 1H cARED +28 353
#note Wait what, that's a word? *desperation challenge*
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELNOTU -  +0 309
#note "I didn't know about that hook....that changes things lol"
>Wayne_Clifford: DDPRV 7N D. +6 359
#note That's right play reeeal slow, make sure I get a time penalty!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELNOTU B10 UN.LOT +20 329
#note Probably an obvious phony to most - he didn't need to challenge though. Especially since I announced 15 instead of 20! Then I begun to write it down. For some reason I wrote the 5 first... then he called "hold" so I stopped writing. He accepts and I add 5 to my score instead of 15! No really, what the hell.
>Wayne_Clifford: DPRV K3 .P +8 367
>Matthew_Larocque: ?E 15F ...Es +6 335
#note Quickly slapped this down before I suffered a -20 penalty. Announced as 5, and I didn't even add this to my total. Wayne didn't mind! (KILN)Ed was the best out, I didn't even know that was a verb.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (DRV) +14 349
#note So, my actual score should have been 339, but I scored 318 instead - lol if that much failed math made me lose that would be unforgivable.
