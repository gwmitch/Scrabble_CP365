>Opponent: ABERV 8D BRAVE +26 26
#note Club game. I mostly posted this for the final turn, if you want to skip ahead, though I have commented on some other plays in between.
>Bill: ?DELLOT D8 .aLLOTED +74 74
#note EXTOLLED for three more.
>Opponent: IIZ 13B ZI.I +26 52
>Bill: DIMOTTW B13 .IT +24 98
#note Really nothing better. MIAOW and IMIDO don't take out the Z; IMIDO at least scores six more, but its leave of TTW is just too disgusting (not that this is great, but at least it's not quite as rigid...worst case I can either play WITED or something through the vowels in BRAVE next turn).
>Opponent: OTU E5 TOU. +8 60
#note OUTBRAVE
>Bill: DEMOOTW F5 OW +28 126
>Opponent: IIUU -IIUU +0 60
>Bill: DEJMMOT 15D .OMED +27 153
#note Not sure why I felt like holding on to the J. I think it may have been that I had to give handicap points in this game, and I like to take out triples and other obvious hotspots in those situations until I've made up the points.
>Opponent: AEELNRS 4F LEANERS +72 132
>Bill: EHJMNTU 14F HM +34 187
#note Too focused on the spot to see UNJAM.
>Opponent: NRW J2 WR.N +15 147
>Bill: CEJNSTU 6D J.. +13 200
#note Noticing that AIO will all potentially give me a double-double.
>Opponent: IO A14 OI +14 161
>Bill: ACENSTU K4 .ECUSANT +94 294
>Opponent: FNUY 10H FUN.Y +13 174
>Bill: AAEGIUX 3L EAU +8 302
#note Hard to justify this... I have to draw something to even be able to reach the triple.
>Opponent: ADNS 8K .ANDS +21 195
>Bill: AEGIIQX N6 QA.I +34 336
>Opponent: AF 3F FA +19 214
>Bill: CEEGIPX O1 PIX +47 383
#note Bailed out by the draws the last two turns after the stupid X setup.
>Opponent: KT 12C K.T +15 229
>Opponent: KT --  -15 214
#note Chicago music journalist... not good in Scrabble (unlike Bob ARUM, Evelyn WAUGH, etc.)
>Bill: CEEEGGY 13G EGGY +18 401
>Opponent: EK 3F ..KE. +22 236
>Bill: CEEERRR I6 ERR +15 416
>Opponent: BO 10D .OB +11 247
>Bill: ACEELRV 11B VA.E +18 434
#note Didn't think of CLEAVE here (which is pathetic, since I saw CLEAVER in my rack) or really anything other than dumping the V and taking this spot. It's not even a great spot unless you can play a long underlap... like CLEAVE.
>Opponent: GINOPST O8 .TOPINGS +88 335
>Opponent: GINOPST --  -88 247
>Bill: ACEHILR H1 IL.. +24 458
#note If she had fished, I was probably just going to play ACHIER at 14J to make sure she wouldn't bingo. Knowing that the blank was still in the bag changed the plan. Quackle actually still values ACHIER (and ARCHIL) behind this even without rack inference.
>Opponent: GINOPST N2 P.G +20 267
>Bill: ?ACEHRT O8 .TARCHEd +97 555
>Opponent: DINOOST O5 OI +13 280
>Bill: I 15N I. +1 556
#note This is the first time I've ever had a forced play of <= one point that I'm aware of.
