#note Or QI, but this seemed to make it easier to block SHITLESS, and blocked more lanes.

#note I can also play IVIED here, and maybe I should I can often score on line 5 next turn, while VIALED leaves with II on an especially bad board for it.

#note So what would you play here? I didn't want to keep a bingo leave like AT because this board isn't ripe for bingos. I didn't want to play JO because that is going south fast. I kept AJ because the J has potential at 9C and further, A works to hook for VOWED and score decently with the J, and I can potentiall draw a strong play underneath on row 11.

#note Is it better to bingo here? I thought not, so I blocked a good scoring spot and kept power-packed tiles.

#note Not a good play. I saw InSULAR but forgot about it. I also missed SpIRULA completely. Oh well, these things happen :). I just need to write my plays down more consistently.
