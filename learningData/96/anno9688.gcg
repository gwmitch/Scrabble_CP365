#note This or WINNER 11D are about even. TWINER is also not bad, because it is more defensive with the W placement but the I is more dangerous. Trade-off.

#note It's close between this and FELSTONE F5. FELSTONE is far more defensive, but the 7 points is worth it.

#note It's a toss-up between EVEN and IDEA M8. IDEA keeps EEN, which is perhaps a slightly better leave, and blocks up a play on N10 to the S. EVEN does also keep ADEI, an okay leave, and scores a little moer, which figures as to why they're so close. AZIDE 11K is not bad too but I like IDEA because the placement of AZIDE's E could give better playback.
