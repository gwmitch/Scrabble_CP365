#note This was the morning to slow down. I saw HERL and played it, didn't think about HANG, which seems better. I autopiloted a bit too much this tournament.

#note Okay, so what do you play here? I'd be curious to know. I want to block the board, and it seems like this heads in the right direction. But is there a better way to do it? There are still a lot of lanes open, and I'm not going to be able to close them all in short order, at least not after this. Also, I didn't notice PAVED, but I think the P is a strong enough tile to play EAVED here anyway.

#note I thought for awhile, but didn't think to consider APO in the same spot! Definitely a good deal better.

#note I can try to block here, and something like VINED will rarely amount to anything for him. But I was okay with this, because I knew I would win.
