>James: GHIORTT 8H GIRTH +26 26
#note GOTH or RIGHTO may also be worth considering because the leaves are potentially worth it. In fact, Quackle favors RIGHTO over GRITH and GIRTH, but slightly. Personally, I'd probably play GRITH next time. 
>Leah: EEIY J6 EY.IE +12 12
>James: ADHMORT K10 MOTH +22 48
#note Quackle likes OMIT I6, which makes sense given the good ADHR leave. I missed that and thought MOTH was decent to score and not leave easy plays for playback (as opposed to MOTH K3). 
>Leah: ADU 7J .AUD +17 29

#note This or PROGRADE in the same spot. 
>Leah: ACI 13J C.IA +18 47
>James: BEINOST N2 BONIEST +81 195
#note I liked this for its overall defense relative to the other BONIEST, and both BONIESTs score better than other bingos by about 9+ points.

#note Best - sEIZIN 8A is interesting but it leaves openings. I like not leaving a thing. 
>Leah: ENOOQRW -  +0 217
#note Challenged. 
>James: ALNORRT F10 LORN +13 398
#note Everything is considered about close to winning now.
