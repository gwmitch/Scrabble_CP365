#note I knew it was going to be an off day starting from this rack. I just couldn't get myself to think here, and automatically just told myself not to look. What am I doing? This might be one of my worst plays of the year.

#note my thinking here is that the only way I lose the game is to a 3x3, and given that he just played AU(L)D, he probably kept 4 good tiles, so it would just come down to the three he drew. Is this too paranoid?

#note CIR(R)I. This is 12 worse. I think I psyched myself out withall the defensive-bordering-on-paranoid plays because my opponent was Karris. Real good, self.
