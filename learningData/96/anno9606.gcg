#note Andrea now realizes she could've moved airline over one more. I didn't mention IRENI(C)AL.

#note So I spend so much time deciding whether or not to play DEFIAN(C)Y*, since Andrea will inevitable make a comeback on me, that I don't even notice this is phony. Unfortunately, I think I have had it adjudicated as valid in the past or something as I was 100% sure it was good. Whew. FAY, my other choice, is probably better.

#note Convinced I can't play GLEG, 'cuz she will undoubtedly play the Z for the win. Of course I was convinced she would now have ZED at M11, but not much I would do about that. Keep in mind, we were now being rushed to finish our games so that the restaurant could let people in for another party.

#note At this point, Andrea discovers she has misadded by 70, and is in fact close to winning the game.

#note H(E)X first is better, but again, being rushed by restaurant.
