#note Still blind to that T. I think this play was the epitome of my day. I saw nothing I liked, and decided, ooh, I can kill all the S hooks, and if he has an A, it'll open something big for me. I think it's reasonable to say something like BIO(t)IN is best, but when I get into these paranoid mindsets, stuff like UN(C)I seems good, and I convince myself not to find better plays. Not a big fan of NUBIA...

#note It sort of feels like positive reinforcement because BIO(t)IN gave him (N)ONGLaRE, and NUBI(A) gave him a 2x2. Or maybe that means there IS some logic to a seemingly counterintuitive, almost paranoid play like UN(C)I? Or maybe I should just play like Quackle and forget all of this? thoughts pleeeeez? :)

#note wabble wabble wabble wabble wabble. But seriously, things are not looking good here, and at this point in the game, I was wondering if I had just paranoided myself into a loss.
