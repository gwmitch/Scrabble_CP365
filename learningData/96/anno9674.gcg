>Noah_Walton: FIIORUX 8G FOU +12 12
#note Sets up the X, so I thought it was fine. ROUX 8G is another good option I didn't see. I may just be sacrificing too many points with FOU, but I think it's not too bad.

>Noah_Walton: IOORSTY 3E .OROSITY +65 111
#note Actually, I thought of the word SORORITY, but not the play. This is probably better anyway.

>Alan_Whitman: EGIN 1L GIEN +37 179
>Noah_Walton: CINORSV 4A VINC. +26 195
#note I found this an interesting play. COVI(n) is the obvious choice. I was thinking ORS would be better than NRS here. I'm probably just undervaluing a leave. I could also do something like COIN 4G and try to stop him from making another ridiculously easy play. Given my opponent, that might be best.
>Alan_Whitman: CERU A1 CUR.E +30 209
>Noah_Walton: OORSSTY 4L SOY +28 223
#note I'm fine with setting up the A hook, because he probably doesn't play the A here if he has it anyway.
>Alan_Whitman: AF 1G FA +36 245
>Noah_Walton: AEKORST 6J KOA +33 256
#note I just didn't think to play KA at all here. Certainly a mistake.

>Noah_Walton: ADIOPUW C1 WOU.D +18 364
#note I didn't see anything down the O column. AUDIO plays there, and I also missed WINDUP and INDOW here. Poor choice.
>Alan_Whitman: AELV 11J LEVA +22 354
>Noah_Walton: AEIIILP -III +0 364
#note Quackle prefers TIPI because it apparently bingos a bunch more than anything else? I'm not convinced...

>Noah_Walton: ADELLMP 9L PLED +15 411
#note My time was running low, and I wasn't sure what to play here. I figured this kept a reasonable leave for me and gave him very little to do next turn. Now that I look at it again though, there doesn't appear to be a problem with just playing L(A)MP. I did a many ply sim (Champ gives some good plays, a lot of bings, and omits my play altogether.) Doing LAMP or PALM is probably a fine move here. I am not sure how to analyze this play though.
>Alan_Whitman: BEEILTT 6D T.ET +6 408
