>James: EEIPUUW -EIUUW +0 0
#note It's my standard idea that holding onto an E when exchanging is mostly useful, because most bingos will use an E somewhere. In this case, I thought the P was useful enough, both pointwise and for bingos, to also hold onto.  Holding onto E, PE, and nothing are probably about the best, depending on what you like to do. PE is the most rack-balanced with least amount left to chance; nothing is the most volatile, and E is somewhere in the middle. 
>Jerry: ?EEJOOW 8G JOW +26 26
>James: AEPRSTT J2 PATTERS +81 81
#note PATTERS J2 is seen as best because it scores the most, even though it allows for S-hooks. TAPSTER J5 77 isn't too bad either. SPATTER J8 is perhaps the most defensive and may be worth thinking of if you are more confident of playing a more defensive style. The reason it is most defensive is that it already orients plays towards the bottom half of the board, which is easier to start blocking off as opposed to the top half. 
>Jerry: ?EENOSU 1G OUtSEEN +81 107
>James: BDDEINR 3H BR.NDIED +76 157
#note Missed 2A BRINDED. That's better because 1) it scores more and 2) leaves a less dangerous tile in the column for 3-3s. 
>Jerry: ENNQRTV N2 V.NT +14 121
>James: DEFHRRY 4D FERRY +41 198
#note Best. Quackle also likes REFRY 4D for the same, albeit really slightly (i.e. in the margin of error), probably because it's less likely to see parallel plays along the F (counterscore).
>Jerry: EENQRTY 3B TREY +24 145
>James: DEGHKLT 5C ETH +36 234
#note I missed THE 5D. I kind of like ETH 5C more though, because it's harder for Jerry to make a standard bingo through the T (and use the DWS).  Quackle also likes KEDGE 6F, mostly because it leaves better tiles and less consonants, but I think the point different (21 to 36 for ETH, 38 for THE) is worth it. 
>Jerry: EIINQSU 2F QI +33 178
>James: CDGKLMO 6F MOCK.D +21 255
#note MOCKED helps to seal more of the top up and I thought was the best for balancing. However, Quackle likes GLOM 9E more - 1 more point, and CDK is also a very useful leave as the tiles all work with each other so well (as long as a vowel is drawn). I personally like MOCKED still, because GLOM gives more possibilities for Jerry to bingo back (at least, with as little collateral damage as possible - bingo from the J or W would give me more options than if he bingos horizontally from H10 after GLOM). 
>Jerry: EILNSUU O3 .UI +10 188
#note I'm not too sure what Jerry should do here. DUI scores necessary points, and assuming he really needs to play off his vowels (which he did, he told me he had another U), it's hard to see DUI L3 being any better. That being said, I don't know if it's worth blocking up the triple lane, if only that he may get to use it in the future. 
>James: ?AGILRT B5 bATGIRL +67 322
#note Best. 
>Jerry: AELNPSU A8 APE +30 218
>James: AEFIIOO 7J .OOFIE +16 338
#note By this point, I just want to get the game over with. I'm up a game and I will win the tournament if I lose this game by less than 65. for do that, Jerry will need to make a 180 point deficit up. ROOFIE doesn't make a 3-3 opportunity, and playing along L8 horizontalliy will get 60 at most (WAND). I thought it worth it because I also can get points from other future plays as such. It helps to run tiles down faster than anything else.   Note that had Jerry not played APE, I'd play LOOIE 11B so as to create a spot for FLOOIE to a triple. 
>Jerry: AAELNSU 5J .AU +14 232
>James: AAAIILW C10 AALII +15 353
#note AALII, like the last play, is to get rid of tiles fast. Again. 
>Jerry: AEHLNNS 8L HENS +55 287
#note Estimated 2% winning chance after this play.
>James: AGMSUWX B14 XU +36 389
#note Since I have the case S, I like XU to possibly give me something like MUSE next turn. Quackle also thinks MAW B13 a good play, likely to make a MIX parallel play along the C-column. 
>Jerry: AEGLNOV 9E AVO +17 304
#note 27 for 2A VEAL retains a 1% winning chance; my play of AVO finishes 14 equity points lower and 0.7% chance of winning.
>James: AGIMOSW 9K MOW +31 420
#note And the tourney is pretty much won. 
>Jerry: BCDEGLN E8 B.LD +14 318
#note It recommends CAB at E8 - praying presumably to draw the S - and yielding nearly a 3% chance of winning.  Instead, my play has 10 points more equity - but only a 0.7% chance to win
>James: AAGIILS 10G GLIA +18 438
>Jerry: CEEGNNZ 11J GEEZ +31 349
#note Made a very poor choice here -- sticking myself with the C as long as James notices and blocks my one opening.  Championship Player recommends EN at F11 - for 5 whole points - I guess to block DOS and JOGS.  What do I do with GENZC after that, though?  I'm not seeing it.
>James: AIOS 7B .O +3 441
#note Championship player doesn't figure out how to optimize here...., suggesting ZOA right off the bat. James did optimize and scores another 48 points to my 11.
>Jerry: CNN 11B ..N. +5 354
#note I totally missed INN/MOWN for 12
