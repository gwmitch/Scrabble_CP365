>Ruth_Hamilton: INOY 8E YONI +14 14
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 8. I could have been Gibsonized last round but instead I botched the endgame for no particularly good reason. So now I'm in a rematch with Ruth and in danger of losing 1st place! Have to keep my composure....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DRRSXY F8 .RYX +22 22
#note I didn't really like this but I have to ditch the Y and X, get a bingo ASAP.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EGN E11 ENG +26 40
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIRSU 14B sUDSIER +73 95
#note Plenty of choices... this ranks about #3, thought Q might knock me for being so aggressive.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EFZ 15G FEZ +56 96
#note Well, that was a pretty bad outcome!
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEIOTW 15A WITE +31 126
>Ruth_Hamilton: LUU D10 ULU +20 116
>Matthew_Larocque: BEELLOS E4 BELL. +20 146
#note Quackle likes LO(R)E but Bees aren't a particularly good letter to hang on too. I'm not fishing for an ABLE bingo.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AQT 7H QAT +24 140
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMNOPS C12 PO.. +17 163
#note Playing aggressive now, maybe I can strike gold next turn.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AEW D4 AWE +27 167
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMMNOS C2 MENO +23 186
#note ooo - MEMEN(T)OS. I can also play NOME it's not much different. I didn't consider EM F5.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AAH B1 AHA +28 195
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMOST K4 AMOSITE +81 267
#note I was really torn on this turn. Bingo or play MOTE for 44? That corner was so juicy but when in doubt, take the points! Quackle agrees, it's not even close.
>Ruth_Hamilton: HU J9 UH +28 223
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEJKLN 4I BL.NKED +32 299
#note Quackle likes J(A)B. I was too eager to dump this mess I guess and put myself in real danger of losing.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ?ENPRTV N2 PR.VENTs +78 301
>Matthew_Larocque: DGIIJRT 13G DIGIT +23 322
#note Q likes RIGID L10 about as much as this
>Ruth_Hamilton: ACGRS 11K SCRAG +36 337
#note yipes
>Matthew_Larocque: AEJOORS J2 JO.E +31 353
#note Going to be a photo finish.... JOE F2 does slightly better in the simulation.
>Ruth_Hamilton: ACDERT A3 TRACED +33 370
>Matthew_Larocque: AINOORS O6 NAOI +23 376
#note Wow.... NAR(C)OS 38! This is like 5th in the sim but Q says it clinches the game so it's just a matter of spread.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AFIIOV 14J FA +28 398
>Matthew_Larocque: ORS F2 ORS +11 387
#note (FA)ROS for 16
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IIOV) +14 401
#note We agreed on a score of 401-396. She made an error somewhere but I wasn't about to ask for a recount on a game this close!
