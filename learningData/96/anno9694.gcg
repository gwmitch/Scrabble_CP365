>James: DILLORU 9H LOUD +12 12
#note Ugh. Chickening out on loudlier does not pay. 
>David: IOOZ K5 ZOOI. +30 44
>James: DDEFILR 8K .DLED +27 39
#note Quackle liked FID L6. It makes sense, because I have IDLED next turn anyway. 
>David: CT 6J C.T +11 55
>James: EFHIIRY N6 FI.RY +27 66
#note Best. 
>David: AU G8 .AU +14 69
>James: EEEHIIP O4 HIE +15 81
#note It's hard to figure out what to do here. HIE? IRE 9M? PIE O4? Quackle likes those plays most, but it's hard to infer what David has after these plays. I would guess and S after COT and VAU but for what it's worth, those inferences aren't very easy to make. 
>David: EIOORST 11G SOOTIER +71 140
>James: EEILNNP H11 .PINE +30 111
#note Best. 
>David: EKY G13 KEY +33 173
>James: EGLNOSW F14 WE +33 144
#note Best, but had he not played there I'd have LONGWISE 13C. There is a problem, thouogh - just how am I going to build out of thise to get a bingo? 
>David: EFU 12L FEU +24 197
>James: BGLNORS 13D BRO..NG +21 165
#note Quackle like SLOB O12, but I think BROKING is useful just because it gives me more of a chance to play out to maybe get a good bingo-ish play. 
>David: IJ D11 JI. +24 221
>James: ALNQSTU L2 SQUA. +39 204
#note Again, I think I need to open up the board, so SQUAT looks okay to me. 
>David: AGINORR 2G GARRI.ON +72 293
>James: AELNNTX H1 L.TEX +39 243
#note From here, the choices get hard. There's no real way to play an X and N for points so I decided to at least create a possible few openings. 
>David: IP M1 P.I +32 325
>James: AEEELNN 14B NEE +19 262
#note Again, I'm trying for a bingo but I doubt it'll work. Maybe ANNEXE 5D is a lot better for its points but it just looks so much easier to block all lanes by David. 
>David: ABMS 15A BAMS +48 373
#note And game over. 
>James: AELNORW E10 WO +28 290
