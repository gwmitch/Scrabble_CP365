>Mike_Ryan: MNOU 8F MUON +12 12
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 1, Game 4. I've played a lot of games with Mike, but this was our first tournament showdown. The wise old man versus the young apprentice!
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIINOR 9E CONI +16 16
#note "Pertaining to dreams" for 64. That aside, Quackle thinks I'm breaking up the rack too much - need to get fishy. I checked Zyzzyva for all the bingos with CORNIE? and knew  only about 50% of them, so for me it's not a great play.
>Mike_Ryan: OSX J8 SOX +33 45
#note Another S Mike? And I wrote down 33, but added 43 to his total. So did he, apparantly. These incorrect scores became prevalent in the tournament though and my opponents often didn't have anything to say!
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEIJRT K9 DIB +24 40
#note I didn't feel like I needed to dump the J immediately - take the only good scoring spot now!
>Mike_Ryan: AA L11 AA +8 53
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFJRTU M9 CUTER +27 67
#note I honestly forgot about the A hook when I made this play. That could have been a catastrophe! Of note (but utterly dangerous) J(UN)CTURE 26. Quackle likes the simple JUT M9.
>Mike_Ryan: AEL 8M ALE +17 70
#note Mike showed me his scoresheet after - he had something like ALEEAES... just brutal considering the hook I created.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFJORRR L4 FJORD +43 110
#note And his play subsequently bailed me out of an exchange. Thanks Mike!
>Mike_Ryan: EP N10 PE +26 96
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANORRT O1 ANTRORs. +74 184
#note Best bingo - it took me a LONG time to see it. The rest are weak sub-60 pointers. Except for an awesome 9 that I had zero chance of discovering.
>Mike_Ryan: AIP N1 PIA +20 116
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGUWZ F8 ..UE +8 192
#note LOL! This is probably the worst play of all three WCSC tournaments. Missing bingos is bad too... sure, but nothing compares to the terribleness of this abomination. Ok, I actually had a plan... you see, I caught that Mike had WA on his rack, and was trying to bait him into setting up a Z bomb for me. But there's already a Z bomb... ZEE for 47! I SAW IT TOO AFTER I HIT MY CLOCK! -_-
>Mike_Ryan: AEW M2 AWE +32 148
#note Nice play Mike too bad I didn't think to USE THAT SPOT HUH?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGTWZ E11 WAG +24 216
#note Now I have to set up my own Z bomb
>Mike_Ryan: ADISY 14B DAISY +42 190
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINRTZ 15A ZEIN +50 266
#note I considered ZEE first but then remembered a 4 letter Z word.
>Mike_Ryan: EILV 15F EVIL +26 216
>Matthew_Larocque: EEOQRTT H14 Q. +11 277
>Mike_Ryan: HTU 6J TH.U +9 225
>Matthew_Larocque: EEORSTT 5D ROSETTE +66 343
#note I wasn't sure if this was good - but my gut told me to slap it down anyways. "I think there's chocolates called rosettes!" "No Matt I think they're small flowers"
>Mike_Ryan: GHT E4 G.TH +8 233
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGIOS D10 GOB +26 369
#note BIGO(T) but that gives him a longshot chance of a bingo I guess
>Mike_Ryan: ?IKLL O11 sKILL +45 278
#note Kind of conceding defeat with this move. I was relieved.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIIOS 4D A.IO +18 387
>Mike_Ryan: DENV 3G VEND +23 301
#note Scored as 24.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFIMS I13 FI. +21 408
#note Quackle says FIE 2H is best - blocking his RY(E).
>Mike_Ryan: NRY H1 RY. +18 319
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMS 3A SEME +15 423
#note I didn't play SEEM? No really, what the hell.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (N) +2 425
#note 425 - 330 was recorded.
