>Mike: INY H7 YIN +12 12
>James: AAEMOSZ 6F ZOA +39 39
#note Best - the leave AEMS with the high score outdoes most other considerations. 
>Mike: AII 9G I.IA +6 18
>James: ABEMNSW 10J WAB +29 68
#note I like WAB because of the leave, though Quackle also proposes WEB at the same spot (probably to giive me some insurance with a ZA play) or WAB J8 (less points but a better leave). WYN 7G is also looked upon favorably but I'm not sure why - is ABEMS really that good a leave? Or is it because they're easy to play along 10J or 8J? 
>Mike: CEHIRS 8J RICHES +48 66
>James: EELMNNS 11K MEN +22 90
#note Chickened out of LENSMEN and didn't see LINESMEN G8. Otherwise, my play at least keeps good tiles. 
>Mike: DPU 12J PUD +29 95
>James: ELNRSTT 5H LENT +16 106
#note Another bad chicken out of NETTLERS N3. I picked this for points. though Quackle also suggests NTH M6 to preserve a good leave, or TIL G8. 
>Mike: AEK 7D KEA +18 113
>James: DEQRSST 8G Q. +22 128
#note It was hard to decide between this and QIS G8 but I thought this would do less inference of other Ss in the hand. There aren't too many good spots to play bingos and he may react to block. Quackle though, likes QIS more, though it is taking it from the perspective that the other side will not play with the inference that an S is in my hand. 
>Mike: AFO 8C OAF +19 132
>James: DEPRSST 9C PET +28 156
#note PST 9C is a far better play this time. It's hard for Mike to make any inferences on my rack this time. 
>Mike: IX 13I XI +21 153
>James: DEORSSW N10 WORDS +40 196
#note Best - good leave and good score. SWORD 14J is quite a unique approach though, as it leaves me with a spot at J15. However, unlike a computer, Mike would wonder why I didn't play WORDS for 40 instead of 29. 
>Mike: DRU J2 DUR. +9 162
>James: ?AEGIOS O1 AGOnISE. +74 270
#note Missed BIOGASES and ISAGOGES O1 for 80. 
>Mike: ?INORSV 14D ReNVOIS +79 241
>James: AJLLORU 3I J.RAL +40 310
#note Best. 
>Mike: FGOT L2 F.GOT +23 264
>James: EHILOTU 15A HOTEL +31 341
#note Well, it's hard to really score a bingo on this rack, so... why not? 
>Mike: EY 13C YE +13 277
>James: IILMNOU 12B NOM +27 368
#note MUNI is favored more at 12D, but whatever. 
>Mike: BET B10 BE.T +18 295
>James: DIILRUU B5 DIRL +14 382
>Mike: ACEV A2 CAVE +16 311

>Mike:  (I) +2 330
#note Luck is so much better than skill.
