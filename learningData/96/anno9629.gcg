>Matthew_Larocque: AAGINPT 8G TAPING +22 22
#note Western Canadian Champs: Early Bird 2, Game 1. Curtis was out for blood against me after I beat him twice in the last tournament. I get ETAPE and ATAP confused often - as evidenced by my pointless debating over whether ATAPING was a bingo. Both of those words are nouns! Quackle really likes that ING synergy as my play doesn't even sim that well. PA? Meh. Lets try turnover.
>Curtis_Kowalski: EITU K7 U.TIE +10 10
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADDINR 12H DANDIeR +77 99
#note ANDRoID too, but it's much less defensive. Sounds cooler though! I didn't know RADDINg. I saw DReADIN(G) but DANDIeR scored a point more and wasn't nearly as risky.
>Curtis_Kowalski: ADEENOT G2 DETONA.E +62 72
>Matthew_Larocque: ABELMOR H1 BOLA +29 128
#note Oops, BL(O)OMER 2x2! BEMA is the play that gets both B + M on the TWS. And you can add an R to BOLA! MO(N) J10 seems to be the sim winner though, is ABLE really that powerful or what?
>Curtis_Kowalski: ?BEEINT 13B EBoNITE +71 143
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIMRR E8 REMAI.ER +70 198
#note Bad phony alert! There's no legit bingos here, this play gives me a MUCH higher chance to win then anything else (if it stays on).
>Curtis_Kowalski: SX F12 S.X +53 196
#note Curtis leaves it so he can cash his X....
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINRW D12 W.RE +39 237
#note oops, RAINWEA(R) for 65. My play finishes high despite the blah leave.
>Curtis_Kowalski: JLRU B10 JUR.L +56 252
#note Curtis hits me with another doozy, 4 plays in a row now!
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFINV N10 FA.INA +34 271
#note This, VA(R)IA, or FIVE(R) 8A? Quackle says my play was fairly poor, those other 2 plays finish at the top though. My thought was that VA(R)IA opened a giant scoring opportunity, while this play opens 2. FIVE(R) kept the doubled As.
>Curtis_Kowalski: HO O14 OH +32 284
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEPTVV O7 CEPE +29 300
#note Wow, this blows! I missed that awesome place for EVE. Quackle says V(EL)VET wins 40% and CEPE only 34.5%.
>Curtis_Kowalski: Q 10J Q. +31 315
#note Still not letting up on the scores!
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKOTVV D5 VIVE +14 314
#note Terrible. VOTIVE, or play VIVE at 14H! that (R)E(TAPING) spot is still there but I can't see it!
>Curtis_Kowalski: MO H12 ..MO +21 336
>Matthew_Larocque: FIKOSTU I3 KUFI +31 345
#note I was happy I saw this though!
>Curtis_Kowalski: DIW 8A WID.. +27 363
>Matthew_Larocque: AAOORST 5C O.A +12 357
#note Why am I playing this instead of A(V)O? This turned out to be a huge mistake too. Don't create hooks for letters I don't have and might not get!
>Curtis_Kowalski: LY 5I .LY +18 381
>Matthew_Larocque: AOORSST 15A OS +19 376
#note Sims quite well shockingly, but AST(ER) is too many points to pass up, says Q.
>Curtis_Kowalski: CGLNU B2 CLUNG +31 412
#note Game over
>Matthew_Larocque: AHORSTT 13M T. +6 382
#note Oh my god. I changed my mind. THIS is the worst play I made in Calgary! I could have sworn there was still a letter in the bag! Nope, bag was empty and I played off 1 letter for 6 points! What am I fishing for anyways? TAPING doesn't take an S which is odd because I was pretty confident that it did. I thought I might have been able to play TORAHS M3. Anyways Quackle says I can't win, except AHS J1 0.18% chance. Wait what, my play sims to a 4.81% chance to win? HAHA I'M A GENIUS!!!!
>Curtis_Kowalski: EGOSYZ 4K OYEZ +37 449
>Matthew_Larocque: AHORST J1 AHS +22 404
#note HAO 3K
>Curtis_Kowalski: GS I11 G.S +15 464
>Curtis_Kowalski:  (ORT) +6 470
#note - 10 on my clock. I was pretty outdrawn, he got big scores with JXQZ and 2 bingos to boot.
