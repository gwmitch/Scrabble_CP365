#note Blocked LORD(L)IER.  Still can't find 2x2s.  11E DIR(TI)ER 32.
>Brett_Haughney: ?BEENRU L12 BE +18 65
#note 15H (S)UBgENRE 80
>Ryan_Fischer: ADHJPPR 6F JAR. +27 118
#note Blocked HADJ for 58.  Don't necessarily care for this leave, but hey, 27 is 27.
>Brett_Haughney: ?ENNRUY N1 nUNNERY +83 148
#note "Get thee to the nunnery!"  Or gunnery.  :)  Of note: UN(FA)NcY.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEHLPP 15H .HLEPPeD +104 222
#note Only.  The 7 here is HOPPLED.
>Brett_Haughney: DEV 1L VE.D +33 181
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIRUWX 4J REWI.D +24 246
#note This is where I start to lose it.  Shoulda tried to lose the X and U right away instead of waiting to cash.  EXUD(E) for 26 is fine.
>Brett_Haughney: FOY 7E FOY +31 212
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIOUUX 5J EX +38 284
#note 38 points is 38 points.  But yuck.

>Ryan_Fischer: AGHIOUU C11 HOG +25 309
#note H1 GIAOU(R) 24?  Saw OHIA, didn't like putting the A there.  GAUCHO *and* GAUCHE are good.  That woulda been nice, too.   Shoulda just played UH had I had these doubts, and maybe I'd see GIAOUR from that leave later.
>Brett_Haughney: IQR K7 ..QIR +34 266
>Ryan_Fischer: AAITUUV B8 VATU +14 323
#note F10 VA(C)UA 20.  Thought I was being kinda cute here, blocking up the board.  Well, not really.
>Brett_Haughney: AEOT 8A O.ATE +32 298
>Ryan_Fischer: AABIUWZ 3F BAIZA +30 353
#note J1 AZU(RE) 34.  Much better.  It's funny, I said to myself, with the Z and U, look for words like AZURE or GAUZE, and that spot just didn't register.
>Brett_Haughney: AEGINST 4A INGATES +74 372
#note ... and with AZURE, this doesn't go down.  Lesson learned.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACNTUUW A1 TUN.CA +24 377
#note Only play with Champ giving it a positive valuation.  Found it with time ticking down.
>Brett_Haughney: EKOSST N13 EK. +15 387
#note But of course he'll block.  Best is STOKE(D), apparently, leaving an S to go out.
>Ryan_Fischer: UW C8 .W +18 395
>Brett_Haughney: OSST 14A TOSS +16 403
#note 2E SOTS 18 and out for 2 more.
