#note I think it is better to do KAS J6 here. There are some options here: I should've considered the position longer.

>Noah: EEINORW 6D OWE +12 289
#note I was trying to block possible bingos, because VUG seemed like a fishing play. But this is poor: I should score well here by playing WIENER.
>KC: EJT 3C J.TE +35 290
>Noah: EFIRRTU N8 TUF.IER +36 325
#note As good as this seemed, there is a significantly better play here. I didn't think of REFIT 12F, which doesn't give back nearly as much.
>KC: AGIORV O3 VIRAGO +39 329
>Noah: AANRRUY N5 AY +28 353
#note I considered this, YAR, ARRAY. and some plays making YOWE. I just thought something like YAR gave back too much. On the other hand, RR with two Rs out is somewhat troubling. What would you play here? Quackle seems to like this best, which seems like a good sign.
>KC: IZ D8 ZI. +22 351
>Noah: AENRRRU -RRU +0 353
#note Yikes. ZIN is real trouble for me here. I could play something like MOURN here, but I wanted to go for a play through the Z. I thought about keeping AER because of this, but had misgivings. ROWER seems like a good play though, especially since KC might not know PROWER.
>KC: CEOR 8A CRO.E +48 399
>Noah: ADEENNR 13M N. +4 357
#note It seemed like I needed a bingo to come back at this point. On the other hand, Quackle suggests just adding the E here for NE, which sorta makes sense. Playing to the R with a bingo usually won't win, so I need a bigger threat.
