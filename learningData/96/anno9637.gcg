#note He said in hindsight AW is better than x1.  He's probably right.

#note Key turn.  He said he left a T here, didn't want to play DELFT, leaving NN.  I just bingoed, so he took a chance.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEHPT A1 TE.EPAtH +167 261
#note Well, I got the SECOND highest play.  During postmortem he noticed and asked if I could find the best play.  When he said there was a better one, I did.  Can you?

#note He pointed out something I was sort of conscious of, but not really. With the Q out here, you have to be wary of 6s ending in QUE.  Also 2J is a hotspot, not to mention all the bingo prospects.  Still, this is the best equity play, and Champ likes it.

>Ryan_Fischer: BLOPRSV 14B V.RB +18 382
#note Okay, don't blow it.  Champ says PLOV(E)R first, then V(E)RB.  I doubted BLOOP, for what it's worth.  It's just fine, but not the play here.  I need to constrict the triple line in case he can play something big there, and pray he didn't just get the other blank.  VERB does that and keeps a vowel, seems solid to me.
>David_Gibson: ALX B1 AX.L +44 389
#note And he's pulled ahead after being down by 156!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?JLOPSV 6L J..L +11 393
#note Well.  I got something I wanted, and some THINGS I really didn't.  I think I banked too much on a bingo here, but with S? in hand, can you blame me?  So: lose the J.  Score.  Keep a vowel.  That's key.  So not JO(G), but J(AR)L.  Static says SLOJ(D) for 26 or x5, keeping S?  Champ wants JOLE or JOG, but I don't trust things not to get disastrous if I don't draw a vowel (very likely).  JOLE blocks a line or three, too, and I need to keep him worried about a bingo.
>David_Gibson: EOYZ 12A ZO.EY +54 443
#note In hindsight, he says, OYEZ for only 42 is better 'cause it blocks row 15 and obstructs 13.  This gives too much back.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EOPSTV 11H OVErST.P +74 467
#note Champ Many plies says V(OE), 63%.  Doesn't list the bingo (only one).  I wonder why.  Maybe I don't understand Many play right.  Thought it's supposed to play to the end.  Adding and simming is about 98% to win.  If I draw the Q without the I, I think, I lose.  Not sure what's right, but I don't think delaying is, because I'm down and need the points.  So if I fish and hit the Q (or maybe F or G) I lose if he can block.

#note That's the hardest I've ever had to work for a win (in a game where I had a 167-point play ... that wasn't even best, no less).
