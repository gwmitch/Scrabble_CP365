#note Moment of truth here, and I couldn't get it done. Looks like the play is LOMING# M10. It scores enough to put me back in the game, digs deep for the blanks, and keeps AN, which might help me fit a bingo in line M making ALA and NAT#.

>Brad_Whitmarsh: EHILOTT (challenge) +5 463
#note I have HAZANIM for 82 available, but with the blank in the pool, he's guaranteed to get HOTEL for 40ish coming back no matter what's in the bag. No choice but to challenge MECKS# even though I was pretty sure it was good.
