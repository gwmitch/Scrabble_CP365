#note This may have been too hasty: GLOBATE is also a good play. It keeps more unexclusive lines open and closes a more exclusive one, She also might not know GLOBATED. I prefer GLOBATE here.

>Noah: IIKMNTU D4 .UMKIN +15 186
#note This was a difficult. I just didn't find much that was satisfying, so I chose to use some tiles and try to draw better ones, preferrably an S or blank; tiles that were getting increasingly valuable on this board.

#note Thought I might get a good shot at scoring down L if I didn't do CRAZE, and CRAZE gave high scoring overlap potential anyway. On the other hand, I get that overlap if I draw the A, so CRAZE might be better.

#note Is this the right play here? Should I keep this spot open with LUM, perhaps? Turns out it wouldn't have matter much.
