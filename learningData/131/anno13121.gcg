#note Interesting sim results. Ex Q is tops? I find that strange because BLSSEO doesn't make many sevens. I guess it makes lots of eights, but I wouldn't count of getting many letters to play through after exchanging 1. And then Ex. QS and Ex. QB are next. I hate exchanging esses. It was really between ELSS and ELOSS, and I didn't like the O. Shrug. The exchanges are all very close, obviously.

#note I spent a lot of time debating this/GOX or BERGS. I liked the bingo blocking of BERGS, but didn't like opening the 2x2. I can survive a weak bingo, but not a 120-pointer. I am happy with my choice. Although GOX is apparently better. I knew it!

#note I struggled here. This is the kind of rack that is begging for a fish. But I just kept telling myself that fishing is the best way to lose here. Fish and miss fish and miss, he bingos and the game is close again. I wanted to pressure, even if it wasn't the right rack for this. TRENDS kills a lot of lines, which I like. But it is the wrong play, I think, because it leaves the -IER 2x2 open. Like I said last turn, I am not going to lose to a dinky bingo on the existing lines. I am going to lose to a huge bingo on this new line. So I dunno. I still like playing here over gishing. But maybe a different word? Not sure. This must be a mistake though.

#note Idiot! It wasn't until after the game that I realized this didn't actually block the -IER 2x2! Oh well. Even something like CuPPIER isn't going to beat me at this point.
