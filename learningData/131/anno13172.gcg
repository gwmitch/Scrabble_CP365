#note Nigel provided his racks for this game.
>Noah: ABEIJPT 9F BITE +22 22
#note I thought that out of BEJ, AJP, AEJP, and ABEJ, AJP would have the best synergy. Quackle suggests that this is not true.

#note An interesting play. I realized that JAPING and JINGO were quite a bit better equity-wise, but with an early deficit, I liked the way this forked the board.

#note Was tempted to try VITRICIDE* here. I like the way this forks the board, but the leave is so bad that CIVIE 10B, which I didn't see, has to be better.

#note I was about 90% sure NOsELIKE was a word. However, it really puts my position in the toilet, and my calculations suggested that challenging was correct.
