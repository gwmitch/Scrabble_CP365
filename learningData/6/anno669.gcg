#note A good start.
>Dave: DEERRSU F7 E.DURERS +63 63
>Bing: AEGOOPU 11E G.OUP +16 98
#note Not so good. Either AERUGO (11D,14) or AGUE (7H,18) would do a much better job of cleaning up this junky rack.
>Dave: AAJN J6 JA.AN +32 95
>Bing: AABEIIO 6J .IAO +11 109
#note OBIAS (14B,14) sims slightly better.
>Dave: QUY L4 QU.Y +32 127
>Bing: ABEEGIT H10 T.BAGE +36 145
#note I thought I could get away with this phony. AUGITE in the same spot is the best valid play. 
>Dave: LSTU 8L SLUT +33 160
>Bing: EEEIIOT -EEIIOT +0 145
#note There was something worth playing: OOLITE (M6,14).
>Dave: FO 12D FO. +15 175
>Bing: ADDEHRW 7E H.W +27 172
#note An error. WADY (7I) scores the same and keeps the superior ADEHR.
>Dave: ACEOV O3 AVOCE. +15 190
>Bing: ADDEERX I11 .AX +41 213
#note Why not APEX for 4 more points?
>Dave: AK 13C KA +17 207
>Bing: ADDEEER J12 REDE +24 237
#note DEE (J12,22) might be a little better for the leave.

#note Missing the best bingo of AVIDNEsS (H1,98).
>Dave: BH 5K H.B +30 312
>Bing: ILMMNRR 7I M.N. +25 347
#note Close but no cigar. AMYL (7J) scores the same with a slightly better leave. And it blocks what's probably the most likely bingo line, which would have been a very good idea.
>Dave: ?CEILOZ M8 .OCaLIZE +88 400
>Bing: EILMORR B5 OM +23 370
#note  I thought I had to try to set something up, but there weren't really too many bingos I could draw: ROILIER, LORINER, FLIRTER/TRIFLER, GIRDLER, RIFLERY. And there was no guarantee that the spot wouldn't be blocked. Quackle prefers MERL (15L,27), but that seems pretty unlikely to win. 
>Dave: DEGIINT C1 IGNITED +81 481
>Bing: EIILRRT 2A RE.ILT +18 388
#note Well, so much for that one. At least I found the best endgame sequence.
>Dave: FORTY A1 F.Y +27 508
>Bing: IR 9I R.I +10 398
#note Well done, Z-Man!
