#note An early blunder. Obviously, ZEBRA is a much better play.

#note This looks reasonable, but I should have just taken the points, and kept the board closed, with WERE (J6,30). Since the bag was so vowel-heavy, the clunky leave shouldn't have been a huge concern.

#note This was actually okay, though it would be quite bad if opponent had AX.

#note Though the tile pool looked very scary, I decided to try to survive one more turn without blocking the bingo line. Bad, bad, bad. The other play I was considering was SICKEE (5D,26), which surely would have won. KIBE (5F,12) might be even better.
