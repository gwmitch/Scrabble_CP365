#note SURFSIDE scores 1 more point, but is weaker defensively. Pretty close between the two.

#note I can't quite see the justification for withholding the 2nd S on this board, but this play sims about even with ANES. I missed ES (9L,18) over the board, but that's probably the best option, since it keeps a great leave and sets up a bingo line. Retaining the IN combination for RETAXING is another (minor) benefit.

#note Tough position. Going up 17 points on a tightening board and keeping the 2 S's seemed pretty good, but possibly the simple JOB might have been better, with the expectation of cashing in on an S. This would also keep a nice bingo-prone leave in case opponent opened the board.

#note I have no idea what this was about. Maybe aliens took over my brain. I guess if I picked UII that would be QUISLING, so there was a slim chance of success.
