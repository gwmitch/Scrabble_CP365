#note I couldn't see EYEBARS, a better play according to Q.
>NP: OU F8 .OU +5 5
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: EIILMOT L3 MOIET. +22 98
#note Q recommends a six-tile play, 11D IOLITE 16.  Although it scores less, it uses an extra tile and doesn't set up as big of a comeback play.

#note Q doesn't hate my fishing play too much.  It recommends 12H ATONIA 19.
>NP: ABIILO C7 BOLI.IA +32 147
#note I held the play.  I knew BOLIVAR but had not seen BOLIVIA before.
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: AEINNTU 8A NA.I +15 158
#note another rack of one-pointers with no bingo.  
>NP: GKNORT 14D TROK.NG +18 165
#note this word looked funny too.

#note Q likes 9E GOX 36 better but I didn't want to give him the open shot at the triple.
>NP: CERW M1 CREW +34 266
>Edward_S._De_Guzman: BEGHOST 11K OHS +33 288
#note Q doesn't like the idea of burning the S.  I just wanted to keep up with scoring.
>NP: ?QRRTU G3 QUaRT.R +30 296
#note He took a very long time to make this play.  I was surprised to see this.  Talking about it later, he said he wanted to score points and dump the Q and was worried I was close to a bingo.  If he had known I was consonant heavy, he would have played something else.

#note drawing the last two power tiles certainly helps in the end.
