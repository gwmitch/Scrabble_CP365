>Matthew_Larocque: EEJNORX 8H JEON +22 22
#note Not sure which placement is best - 2x2s don't worry me that much though, and this makes it hard for sevens to go down. 
>Emil_Rem: ELOR 9G LORE +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EENNRX 7J REX +15 37
#note With the blank draw, I told myself that I just needed to ditch the X and try to bingo asap. I still hated keeping two Ns and getting nothing from the X. Not sure if I saw 10H EN, which limits Emil's scoring next turn.
>Emil_Rem: DEGO 10F DOGE +26 46
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEFNNQ -CFNQ +0 37
#note I somehow overlooked FROE, which makes the F a letter worth keeping here. Sim suggests 6K FEN, but this is not a situation where I want to keep the Q.
>Emil_Rem: EHIL L3 HELI. +30 76
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFIKLN M2 KIF +35 72
#note KIF/FROE, obviously.
>Emil_Rem: CERW 11D CREW +27 103
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEHLNU D8 LUN.H +22 94
#note Even though I know ELENCHI, I was ignorant to ELENCHUS, and I did not know PENUCHLE. Otherwise, HEN(C)E scores more but keeps the U. 12F LEU looks good too.
>Emil_Rem: NTTUY 12G NUTTY +16 119
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEINPP N1 PIP +34 128
#note Debated playing *PIPEmEN. The real bingo here is PEPsINE.  I knew PEPTONE and PEPTIDE, but somehow didn't pick up PEPsINE. 
>Emil_Rem: DOS O1 ODS +41 160
#note I was hoping I wouldn't get hit nearly that hard :/
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEINOR 11K OE +14 142
#note Really bad game for me so far. I see ONERIER and ELOINER  right away, but fail to find HEROINE and completely forget PEREION a word. I shouldn't even be in this game.
>Emil_Rem: AEW 8A WEA. +21 181
#note I knew that WEEL didn't take the S, but in this moment I couldn't remember if WEAL was the same or not.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEGINR B2 GREENI.s +70 212
#note WEALD is a word, so REIGNED or ENERGID look like the right defensive plays. I was having a hard time finding stuff... distracted by all the previous turns where I didn't find anything.
>Emil_Rem: AENRSTV E2 TAVERNS +78 259
>Matthew_Larocque: AAMSUYZ -  +0 212
#note I challenge WEALS because I think I'm unlikely to win at this point.
>Emil_Rem: ITT A7 T.IT +10 269
>Matthew_Larocque: AAMSUYZ 7A ..Z +43 255
#note Lucky. Sim is still only giving me 24% on this.
>Emil_Rem: ADI 4D A.ID +16 285
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEMSUY C11 SEAMY +35 290
#note 35 points puts me slightly ahead - I  might as well take a gamble and go for brute scoring. I couldn't see a good reason to be cautious, where else am I going to score?
>Emil_Rem: MOORT H1 MOTOR +34 319
>Emil_Rem: MOORT --  -34 285
#note Wow.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADGOU 15A GU. +21 311
#note That was a huge break. Now what? I decided to take out the obvious place to score and get rid of the letters I didn't want.... Sim is giving a slight  nod to GA(Y), but that could be because the Q is still looming.
>Emil_Rem: IMOORT 5I MOI. +12 297
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AABCDO 10K CAB +17 328
#note I was guessing he didn't have an S, since he likely would have used it for extra points last turn by tacking it on. I was running out of time, again, so I needed some  breathing room. I kind figured this was a bad play, but maybe Emil will make another mistake? Also I briefly wondered if *BAC was a new three. I know.
>Emil_Rem: AFORST N10 SOFTA +30 327
#note He hesitated for a long time, taking it off and putting it back on. Based on this partial rack, something like FO(U) would win a lot more often. SOFTA gives me lots of points that I wouldn't have otherwise.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADOQ 13L QA. +24 352
#note Missed rack, but I'm sure this was the only play that made sene.
>Emil_Rem: ABIILRU 14H LIBRI +24 351
#note Not sure if Emil was tracking or not, but he admitted that he wasn't paying attention to what letters I had.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADNOV 15E AVOiD +30 382
#note DiVAN/DeVON score 32.
>Emil_Rem: AU I4 A.U +5 356
>Emil_Rem:  (N) +2 358
#note Neither of us played too well here, but in the end someone had to be the winner.
