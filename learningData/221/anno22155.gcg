>Matthew_Larocque: CDEMNNO 8D CONDEMN +80 80
#note I thought this would be safe from extensions...
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ABGINOT 7H BOATING +73 73
#note CONDEMNATION! He also missed TABOOING for 94.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGKNPQT J6 Q..AT +36 116
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIMR K3 REMI. +25 98
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGKNPY 4H FAK.Y +38 154
>Juraj_Pivovarov: LOO H1 LOO. +21 119
#note I'll end up missing the A hook on this all game.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACGNPRX 2F PR.NG +18 172
#note I must not have seen C(O)AX because I think that's enough points to keep PRNG. Or PAX under LOOF.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: JSTU O5 JUST +44 163
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDEIOX K10 OXIC +28 200
#note I couldn't remember for sure if AXENIC was good, but there's also AXONIC, EXONIC, and ANOXIC! Yikes. I went for the challenge bait and eliminated the risky Qanat S-hook.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ELZ -  +0 163
#note I didn't actually expect it to work!
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEEEG 12I BE.GE +16 216
#note Without seeing LOOFA, no good plays seemed to stand out. I wanted to keep EAD for READ(JUST).
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ELZ 13M LEZ +28 191
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHLRW O1 READ.... +54 270
#note That classic dilemma of whether to make the flashy play or the correct play. My gut said HA(Z)ED or HA(Z)EL was the right thing to do - it severely reduces his average score next turn. He told me after the game that he was hoping to get READ(JUST) as well, but was short one letter. In the end I got too cocky and I thought I could keep outscoring him.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AERR O11 RA.ER +45 236
#note I'm so bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: HILPSTW 5D WHILST +34 304
#note Have to take out the easiest bingo lane.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DFNU E7 F.UND +18 254
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINOPT 4D OAT +23 327
#note I think this was my rack. Trying to keep my distance in case he gets a bingo.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AVW 3B VAW +27 281
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNOP 13F LOPE +13 340
#note Weird turn. I thought this would stop bingos ending in E or something. There are still other places to bingo and this doesn't score any points. EN(V)ELOP looks good, or just N2 OPE for 21.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AHIORU B1 HA.IOUR +30 311
#note Uh oh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIINU A7 EAU +11 351
#note Now I really wish I had kept at least the L - which is why OPE would have been good last turn. Now I'm helpless to score anything. Am I supposed to just play A(D)IEU and cross my fingers? I mean two blanks, seriously. I can't not play here.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ISV 1A S.IV +42 353
#note :(
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIINTY N13 .YE +24 375
#note I ran out of time. There is a seven and an eight here, but I  knew neither one. Everything else ends up losing per champ.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?DEEIS 12B DIESEl +25 378
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (?IINT) +8 386
#note Seriously, just play through the Z, Matt.
