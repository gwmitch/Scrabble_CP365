>Josh: AAEFLNN H7 FAN +12 12
#note missing FAENA. This isn't a very impressive game on either of our ends, I warn you.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ABY I6 BAY +20 20
>Josh: ACEHILN 10H ECHINAL +79 91
>Josh: ACEHILN --  -79 12
#note What was I thinking?!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADEGL J4 GLADE +28 48
#note Bernard was devastated when he realized his mistake here.
>Josh: ACEHILN 4C LEACHIN. +80 92
>Bernard_Gotlieb: HMU F2 MU.H +17 65
>Josh: ?EEENRZ 10F sNEEZER +92 184
#note Find the only other word that uses all of my tiles! I didn't know it.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADM 11I DAM +34 99
>Josh: FGIIOTV L6 VIGO. +11 195
#note Absolutely no clue what to do here, so I just went with board control
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EILTU 12K UTILE +17 116
>Josh: AFITX O7 FIXAT. +48 243
#note Forgot my full rack. In judging between FIX and FIXAT(E), FIXAT(E) had much better board control and future scoring potential for me. Was worth the 6 points, believe me!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEILNNS 12C LANNIES +70 186
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEILNNS --  -70 116
>Josh: ITW 5E W.IT +37 280
#note Neither of us noticed the two bingos Bernard had through the M.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEILNNS M12 .N +4 120
>Josh: CEIRSTY 14J CRESTY +37 317
#note I definitely thought this was a word. Ouch. Good thing Bernard did too. He was also very aggravated at himself throughout this whole game. Anyhow, I should just fish here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEILNSS 12C SALINES +70 190
#note Correct choice here by Bernard to sacrifice 5 points for better board position.
>Josh: BIOP N8 BOP +36 353
>Bernard_Gotlieb: GO H12 .GO +4 194
>Josh: AEIIORS 15D ARIOSI +36 389
#note Not sure if I should go for spread here and leave the hook open. Probably not. He could be quite strong with the case blank.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ?EEORRV 2D RE.OVERs +64 258
#note REVERsO would have hurt a lot. Apparently PLEACHING is a word, so B2 REpROVE is the play. 
>Josh: EIKNOTU 1A KENO +30 419
#note My thought process was kind of flawed here, I remember. I wanted to avoid eating the Q, so I wanted to keep the U. I also didn't want Bernard to hit anything like a bingo or a big J play, so I didn't want to put anything other than the K at A1, and that was a big spot for the J too. But I overthought things and I think I should have just played TOKEN 1A. Just take the points and leave one in the bag. Anyways, KETO is better than KENO.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: OP 14E OP +22 280
>Josh: DIJOQTU 11A QUID +19 438
#note I knew this was wrong in the grand scheme of things, but I was pretty sure Bernard would mess up some way or another after this play, so I decided it was worth the points sacrifice. I have outs that he can't block but he might miss JO(IS)T and he might try to block JOT(s) and also not save any scoring options.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ADERTUW C10 W.. +6 286
#note Forget I said that, he can block with DURE or RUDE, and WR(IS)T/WA(IS)T work too. Bernard just crashed here.
>Josh: JOT 13A JOT +34 472
>Josh:  (ADERTU) +14 486
