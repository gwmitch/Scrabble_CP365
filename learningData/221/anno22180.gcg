>Siri_Tillekeratne: AGNOT 8D TANGO +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEILOW 7G AWOL +18 18
#note Unsure, I didn't think this rack warranted playing short, but maybe I was wrong. WI(N)O/WO(N) sim better. Siri seems to fish a lot against me so I was okay with turning tiles.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABW 9H WAB +18 32
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEINZ 9C ZEE +26 44
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EHMNOS K9 SHOwMEN +81 113
#note This plays for 86 with a safer placement.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINX 14J X.NIA +56 100
#note Missed last letter. This was probably the play regardless. Unless I missed EXA(M)INED. I think I had the U because I looked at any possible short X plays.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IPY 15H PYI. +36 149
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDENUV 15M DEV +26 126
#note No bingos, and I didn't like having to play this. He will likely hit me back for close to 30.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BI 13K .IB +28 177
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDENNU J9 .UD +18 144
#note UNENDED is the 7, didn't really know that one. UNb(O)NDED also plays for 59.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ER L11 RE.. +14 191
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEFNNO C9 .ONED +30 174
#note (Z)ENDO is new apparently. Just to make up for *ZEN still not being valid.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EKU 11C .UKE +16 207
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAFGNT 10F FA +26 200
#note This is why missing bingos is bad.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DIN 12B D.NI +20 227
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGINTY M5 TANGIlY +70 270
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGINTY --  -70 200
#note I could just play sTAYING, but that would be too smart. To be fair, I was actually really certain *TANGILY was good. Still, passing up a 100% sure bingo is almost always a bad idea. I was off to a mediocre start so now was no time for messing around.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: CIR H12 CRI. +11 238
#note I didn't even know this new 4, I was just happy he only scored 11 points after my blunder.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGINTY 6A sTAYING +69 269
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AOR 13E ROA. +12 250
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEIRS A4 RE.EE +15 284
#note I strongly thought about playing just (s)EE for 6 points. Sim agrees that RE(s)EE is much better.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: LRTU D2 TRUL. +16 266
>Matthew_Larocque: EIOOOSV -IOOOV +0 284
#note I can't remember if I missed (L)OO or didn't like it. There's a lack of vowels in the bag so I think (L)OO is a good play now - keeping three vowels is nothing to worry about.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: J 10B J. +25 291
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILMSS 14E SH +34 318
>Siri_Tillekeratne: CFPQ -CFPQ +0 291
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILMS 6I MAG +16 334
#note I was very low on time, and I thought of MILEAGES, but had no idea MILAGES was good. G(R)EMIALS too. Bad play, etc.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OT B12 .OT +11 302
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILOPS 15A LEAP +32 366
#note Quackle says this wins 89% of the time.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: UV K4 VU. +14 316
>Matthew_Larocque: CFIIOQS M9 QIS +27 393
#note I actually lose by less if I know/play FIS(T)IC
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EILOSTT 3C T.IOLETS +70 386
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (CFIOR) +20 406
#note -10. Next time, don't play *TANGILY,  Matt.
