>Josh: ?CEIIOO 8E COO.IE +12 12
#note I had another option I didn't consider, I5 OI. I think that's not the right play, but CEIO? is better than I? and I'm preventing Ross from making his highest-scoring play a lot of the time. Interesting, I should have considered it.

>Josh: ?IILRTW 7J WRIT +13 25
#note Ugh, I meant to play WILT here but I put the wrong word down. I instantly regretted making this play. It gives back much more, but at least it usually forces Ross to open the board. But with the same tiles I can make a strong play in I2 TWI(E)R. Missed that too.

#note I spent a lot of time here and missed BANISHED in two spots. I guess I didn't spend long enough... Horrible. I also missed F4 EDH so I didn't even make the right non-bingo play.

#note F3 TUMP or UMP if I don't want to set up the hook. I was definitely distracted this game.

#note A4 AMNIONs. I couldn't remember the third word in AIMNNOS
>Ross_Brown: AEU A8 EAU +14 227
>Josh: FGGRVWX -FGGRVW +0 305
#note I'm not sure if this was my rack. If it was, I missed 11H V(U)GG :/. I guess I was happy to throw all that junk back into the pool and almost guarantee that I draw into a 50-point X play next turn.
>Ross_Brown: O 14H O. +4 231
#note This was a scholarly play by Ross. I imagine he was eliminating the possibility of getting immediately outscored by the X bombs that were lingering around that area and giving himself a fighting chance of getting a bingo down and getting back into the game.
>Josh: AIIJLRX B6 JAR +28 333
#note I decided here that it was most important to prevent Ross from getting two bingos down. I was far enough ahead to outrun one, so I decided to block the rest of the top quadrants of the board instead of making a play like F2 JAIL
>Ross_Brown: AEG A12 .EAG +26 257
>Josh: EFIILMX F3 FILM +31 364
#note After Ross' last play (not a fish), I decided he was unlikely enough to get a bingo down here, so I opted not to worry about the lanes downstairs and maximize my point spread in the instances where Ross doesn't bingo. I would give him a 10% chance of getting a bingo down. I now doubt my logic was sound here, possibly just because of the results, but why sacrifice a bunch of spread 10% of the time when I'm only increasing it by a bit the other 90% of the time? I should just play (C)LIME or even (C)IMEX.
>Ross_Brown: AEILRST 12G RE.ITALS +72 329
>Josh: EEGIRXY I1 REGI. +8 372
#note I really couldn't find any out in twos besides this one. But there is another one in (F)IXER 3F that actually banks one more point in the end. But this is so cute that Quackle can't even find it. 

But if you're interested, the second best play is not an out in two, and with perfect play on Ross' ends up banking the same as REGI(E). But perfect play is very difficult after my play of M11 I(L)EX, as he has to block L11 G(A)YER in the best way possible, which ends up being S(T)AG 11J for 10, setting up (A)VOW L12 if you can visualize that! Anyways, seems this worked out best.
>Ross_Brown: AGORSVW H1 OW +26 355
#note changed from V(R)OW, the best play, to this. Guess he hoped I would miss my outs.
