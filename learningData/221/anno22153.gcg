>Will: BEKLO 8D BLOKE +28 28
>Matthew: AFIOPTU 7H POUF +14 14
#note TUFOLI best, mine not too too far behind in about 8th

I don't know if TUFOLI is new, but it is seemingly its own plural, taking no S-back hook
>Will: EHM 8J HEM +21 49
>Matthew: AAIINPT 9F NIPA +24 38
#note PIANI 9C best, mine 10th, maybe off the board

Only a two point-difference in score, yet the leave becomes AT instead of AIT - vastly superior
>Will: AHJ 9K HAJ +34 83
>Matthew: ?AIIOST 10H OI +12 50
#note STOAI 10F best, mine second

I'm a little surprzed that the bingo-prone leave isn't worth ven more on this board, yet Q indicates 19 points is a LOT to give up.   Also, there are no blanks or esses spent yet.

#note ADO 12H best, mine a very distant fourth

The tiles unseen to me were suprisingly consonant-heavy, so spending the D and scoring four more points are sure good.  But this game was sooo tight, I didn't feel like risking Will scoring from 15D.
>Will: ETUV K11 VE.TU +16 327
#note Even if Will was paying close attention - and I suspect he was - to the consonant-vowel-unseen ration, he couldn't have reasonably suspect this E and U would be nearly the last true vowels he'd see.   Baaaaad luck.
>Matthew: ACDEELO 14F DE.L +20 332
#note best
>Will: ILT E4 LIT +8 335
>Matthew: ACEFNOT D1 FACE +30 362
#note Missing CONFLATE and FALCONET aside, I thoiught FACE would rate better on percentage chance to win.  I felt I was putting Will in a position to need to bingo to win.  

 I suspect I was underestimating the chances of him making an eight theough FACE since both a blank and E and two esses were unseen to me.   I was perhaps VERY lucky the E and Y were in the bag.
>Will: ?LRSSVX F2 XiS +28 363
>Matthew: ENOTY M6 YO +12 374
#note EON L13 best, mine 9th, but 100% to win

I thought I was V-sticking Will, but had missed 15J
>Will: LRSV 14A ...S +14 377
#note The one way i could lose was to challenge and then discover ORAS was a new word.    It is not.
>Matthew: ENT 2A ETN. +8 382
#note NET L4 best, mine 5th
