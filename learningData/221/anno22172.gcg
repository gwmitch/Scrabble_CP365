>Josh: ABEIQRR 11B BI.ARRE +36 72
#note I've been having trouble judging whether or not to shed my Q when it's close. Given how open the board is, and how unfriendly it is to the Q, I should have just played QAI(D) 5E. Things are looking pretty grim though.

>Josh: EEIIORY 13B EYRIE +35 225
#note Was interesting here between 13B EYRIE and D1 EYRIE for 2 fewer points. Both spots are annoying as Allen can score well with them, but I think it was important to a) keep the board alive for as long as possible here and b) take the two extra points.
>Allen_Pengelly: BSTTU D1 BUTTS +35 292
#note Damn, looks like I chose wrong.
>Josh: AAIIOPY 8L .YPO +30 255
#note (G)APY. These little mistakes are costly in games where not much goes my way. 
>Allen_Pengelly: OOX 14A OXO +43 335
>Josh: AAIIITU 5K A.IA +17 272
#note I was very annoyed at OXO as I had no way of taking advantage of what it opened. Hopefully Allen isn't able to block next turn.
>Allen_Pengelly: DOPR 15C DROP +15 350
#note good play by Allen, blocking the biggest threats to his lead.
>Josh: IIINTUU -IIUU +0 272
#note Unfortunately I was now stuck having to exchange.
>Allen_Pengelly: IJNT 1K J.INT +36 386
>Josh: ILMNNOT 1A LIM.O +27 299
#note I'm in trouble now, I need to score, keep lines open and hope for something big next turn.
>Allen_Pengelly: AA 9M AA +13 399
>Josh: ACFNNTU 2B FA.N +30 329
#note Game is essentially over, and he has a better rack than me. Cutting my losses now, there were many games to go still.
>Allen_Pengelly: ADEIISU 15C ....SIED +36 435
>Josh: ACLNSTU I10 US.NC. +28 357
#note (DROP)SIED was a great play, except that it didn't block (O)SCULANT. I did look through the O, but I only considered stuff that formed (AA)L, not (AA)S, which was really stupid.  I threw 63 points of pure spread away this turn
