#note quite the shootout so far!
>JD: ?ENQUVX C4 VEX +20 212
#note pretty close between this and VEX at M6 for 13. either of my plays blocks a lane, which is unideal, but column M seemed more important to leave open.

#note quackle seems to agree that I read this play correctly - I wasn't all that eager to play NIP at N4, which sets up a lot of potential bingos after kevin has just fished. by playing this I save a decent leave and wait to see what he does, and give myself a draw for GENIP for 49.

#note the G on row 12 is no longer worrysome because I have the last N, so I might as well play PLOP at A1. I didn't see that spot yet.

#note I felt uncertain that I had picked the best move, running out of almost all of my time, but my cjoice now seems reasonable. I felt that a bingo to the E on row 15 was about the only way I could lose, since a bingo on row 14 would give me great comebacks. on the other hand, I open a great lane, and if he can effectively open another part of the board (presumably the top-right) I could now lose to him bingoing out.

#note 5 points worse than my best play of WONT/TOWN/NOWT at the same spot. clearly must block his huge plays here.
>Kevin_Fraley: ABMOR 14J MOB +20 438
#note BAM is 5 better because it doesn't give me a new out. we were both out of time.
