>Josh: BGILOWX H7 BOX +24 24
#note Many things were close here and I was aware of that. I decided that when in doubt, taking the points and setting myself up for next turn (WIG overlapping the OX of BOX) was my best bet.
>Ross_Brown: IIOOUUW G8 WOO +22 22
#note Ross's real rack. Very rough starting draw for him, but he should not have played through it, and I think we both agreed on that after the game.
>Josh: AGGILRW F10 WIG +28 52
>Ross_Brown: IIUU -IIUU +0 22
>Josh: AAFGLRR I5 FRAG +21 73
#note Given a relatively small exchange, I'm less liable to be scored on and more liable to get bingo-ed on next turn, so I imagined this play wouldn't end that badly. The other option is 11C FRA(I)L, which scores 2 more, but I think this is better given what I just mentioned.
>Ross_Brown: DL 11E L.D +16 38
>Josh: AEHJLNR 12D JA. +24 97
#note Took a bit longer here trying to convince myself that J2 JANE wasn't completely insane, but I never managed to change my mind. He is fishing more times than not, and opening a really easy-to-hit 2x2 lane is a bad idea. I am increasing his chances of a bingo at by a very large percentage, and slightly crippling myself as well. If JANE is about even with JA(G) according to Quackle, I must be right. Time left: 20:55
>Ross_Brown: EI 5I .IE +12 50
>Josh: AEHLNRT K4 L.ATHERN +72 169
#note JA(G) was not the play that was going to give me a bingo this turn, and yet...
>Ross_Brown: AE L7 AE +11 61
>Josh: AAGINSU M1 IGUANAS +72 241
#note ridiculous
>Ross_Brown: EINRRTT 1K TR.ER +18 79
#note NITT(I)ER was played at first, then this. Ross's play is N1 TINTER.
>Josh: DEIILPV N6 DEV +22 263
#note Now seemed a good time to start destroying the board. The play that adds two letters to mine is tempting, but as they say, do not be tempted by the devil ;)
>Ross_Brown: DU E11 ..UD +5 84
>Josh: ?AIILPQ 2J QI +33 296
>Ross_Brown: IKNST 15E SKINT +33 117
#note As he said himself in game, Ross somehow managed to draw the wrong tiles here.
>Josh: ?ABILPT J9 BAIL +18 314
#note LP? is better than PT?, so BAIT looks better. This play was an attempt to close down the bottom in two turns and score. I couldn't close it completely in one turn, so this was the next best option.
>Ross_Brown: NOS 13C NO.S +25 142
>Josh: ?ENOPTT L11 NETOP +23 337
#note There we go
>Ross_Brown: DENU 15K U.END +24 166
>Josh: ?EFLMPR 14K M.PE +28 365
#note Oops, M12 FEM(E). Probably a bit better.
>Ross_Brown: OOZ 14A ZOO +26 192
>Josh: ?EELRST A12 La.E +39 404
#note If I want to be even cuter I can play (Z)a for 30 here, but this is definitely the spread play.
>Ross_Brown: IMO 3I OI +14 206
#note nice setup
>Josh: AERSTUY 9M YA +17 421
#note Maybe O1 (R)YU for 6. I want to be able to bingo as much as possible if Ross decides to open up next turn.
>Ross_Brown: ACM H1 CAM +26 232
>Josh: ERSTTUV 4C VERTUS +29 450
#note Weird position here. I didn't take the time to search for all of the bingos here Ross could have. Apparently I'm supposed to play 12L (E)RUV and threaten my own bingo. I think that's crazy, but it just might work. Otherwise, I debated ERUVS and VERTUS here and decided to go for an out. I didn't think I was giving Ross many more bingos floating an extra V out in the open.
>Ross_Brown: ?EEFIIY E1 FIE.IlY +24 256
#note -11 to a tough-to-see vI(V)IFY C2.
>Josh: CHRT 12L .TCH +13 463
