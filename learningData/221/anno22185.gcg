>Jennifer_Lee: DEGJOOW H4 WODGE +28 28
#note I saw JOWED, but couldn't remember for sure whether it was a verb. Definitely the better play.
>Bob_Linn: ADEV 4H .AVED +24 24
>Jennifer_Lee: AIJLOSY I3 J.Y +26 54
#note JO(E)Y and JI(V)Y are preferred.
>Bob_Linn: ITZ 5K TIZ +31 55
>Jennifer_Lee: ?AILOST 9G ISOLATe +69 123
>Bob_Linn: DIOV N6 VOID +24 79
>Jennifer_Lee: AEMOOQR L7 QA. +13 136
#note Quackle prefers (T)EAROOM at L9, leaving Q.
>Bob_Linn: BIR K9 .BRI +12 91
#note I assume Bob set this up while holding the N, correctly thinking that I did not know the ABRI/N hook. I didn't know ABRI either...
>Jennifer_Lee: EEEMOPR 8L .M.E +21 157
#note I took a lot of time on this play and was not thrilled with my choice. I did not know (ABRI)M. EMPERO(R) and POMER(OY) are kind of cool.
>Bob_Linn: ?ELNRTU 13H gRUNTLE +81 172
#note Yep, I challenged both words. I've only heard DISGRUNTLED, not GRUNTLE. Losing this challenge did not gruntle me. 
>Jennifer_Lee: EOOPRRU H11 RO.UE +15 172
#note Did not know PRORO(G)UE at 7C. After the bingo, Quackle likes (L)O at J9, leaving EOPRRU, which puzzles me. RO(g)UE is next. 
>Bob_Linn: EEHW 6D HEWE. +20 192
>Jennifer_Lee: CNOOPRR 5B CROP +29 201
#note I really wanted to sling the C on HEWED to make C(HEWED), but I did not see a way to do it and hit the DWS.
>Bob_Linn: NO 4D NO +21 213
#note Bob took a long time on this play. Quackle likes his play best, though! (I don't know what his leave was.)
>Jennifer_Lee: AINORTY B2 ORA.Y +36 237
#note Augh, I missed (C)ARYOTIN. I did not know RO(R)TY at C3 or T(HEWED).
>Bob_Linn: CEHIN A6 NICHE +35 248
>Jennifer_Lee: AAFIMNT B10 FAINT +45 282
#note Lots of options here. In hindsight, FITNA would have been better than FAINT because it would not slot the vowel next to the DLS. I did not remember FITNA, but I did remember MAFIA, and that would probably have been better than FAINT for the same reason. Although interestingly, Quackle likes FAINT best. 
>Bob_Linn: AIKL A12 KAIL +54 302
>Jennifer_Lee: AABMOUU A1 MOU +19 301
#note I was really unsure about what to do on this turn. Quackle likes UMU at A1.
>Bob_Linn: AEP C12 PEA +28 330
>Jennifer_Lee: AABSSTU D8 TUBAS +36 337
#note I didn't know BUATS.
>Bob_Linn: EEILNRT 15F TR.ELINE +59 389
#note New CSW15 addition. 
>Jennifer_Lee: AEFGNSS N12 F.ES +23 360
#note I messed up the endgame here. Quackle wants me to play EF. I'm not sure where Quackle is going with this. Quackle doesn't know that TREELINES is good in CSW15.
>Bob_Linn: DGIX 3E DIG +14 403
#note At this point, Bob has a 100% chance of winning. 
>Jennifer_Lee: AGNS 10I NA.S +27 387
#note I missed ANGS(T) at F11.
>Bob_Linn: X F2 X. +25 428
