#note I thought this was positionally favorable to TALKIER or RATLIKE on column D because bingos on the whole right side were no longer possible. I also thought that I wasn't giving him a shot back into the game sooner by omitting to play on the left. I noticed the J in the bag and also decided I didn't like TALKiER because it gave him a nicer spot for it, but the Z in the bag is also an issue. I think I may have overthought a bit here and I should have taken the extra points, but hey, disconnected nines. Unfortunately the better disconnected 9 was missed, TELEMARKS!

#note I wanted to block all Dan's possible bingos here although I only saw GEODETI(C). But I also wanted to make sure I wasn't going to lose. I think leaving 2 in the bag ensures I have privileged access to the endgame and therefore I don't see a scenario where I lose, as there aren't really two spots where Dan can threaten an out with 4 letters if he plays the maximum of 5 letters next turn with something like GOODI(E) 14J. If I draw the G, he doesn't even have two outs with EERT! But if I draw the T, he indeed has two spots for EEGR, with GE(N)RE 12A and EGER F1. Therefore ILEX is a fallible play I perhaps shouldn't have made. Hmm! I guess I just need to play IN(BY) for 27 and win in every scenario he doesn't have a bingo, and even in some that he does, as I might be able to bingo back with OUTRA(G)ED after GEODETI(C) if the G remains in the bag.
