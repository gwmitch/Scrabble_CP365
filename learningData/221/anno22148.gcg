CHASMY is weeeeird
>Matthew_Ridout: ?AIOOSX K3 OXO +33 285

Costly - I correctly dismissed OZONAL* as a possibility, never recalled the A-front hook

>Steve_Bush: AEILPTV 8L .ALT +33 337
#note APPLET A3 best, MALT 4th
CP full-game report only even bothered listing four plays as worthwhile, just sorta cool and odd

#note FAY 2L best at 97% to win.  Mine was 5th, only 68% to win and 20+ valuation points worse.   
12 points just felt like a lot to give up
>Steve_Bush: ?EIOOPS A1 POO +19 388
#note Best
And suddenly Steve is almost 90% to win, up from as low as about 11% early.   Quite the comeback!
>Matthew_Ridout: ?FINRUY D1 FRoN.Y +32 413
#note And given what I drew, his play was THE winner.  Nothing I play here can win, per CP report.
I tried FRONDY* hoping it was good (I thought it was actually) and that he would foolishly challenge.  Foolishly, since he can win simply by going out.
