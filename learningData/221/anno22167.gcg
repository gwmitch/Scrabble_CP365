>Josh: DEEGOWX H4 WEDGE +28 28
#note Finals. I was happy to make it this far, and I made sure I was ready, focused, and serene during this game. I made a cup of my holy basil tea, and thus it began.
>Mark_Edelson: DFIW 5E WIF.D +24 24
>Josh: BOSTTXY 4D BOX +38 66
#note 23:50
>Mark_Edelson: BHTU 6B BHUT +21 45
>Josh: ?AQSTTY 9E QATS +25 91
#note Unbelievably enough, SQuATTY is a word. I had no idea! This is at least 30 points worse. I already deserve to lose this game and we haven't even gotten that far! 22:54
>Mark_Edelson: OY 10F YO +28 73
#note 11G OOpHYTE is the other available bingo.
>Josh: ?EHOOTY 8H .YEtOOTH +92 183
#note There is only one other available bingo, and I hope I would have seen it had I not found this. 22:21
>Mark_Edelson: EGILNST -  +0 73
#note I won a challenge!...
>Josh: ADEJNRR 11B JARRED +38 221
#note 21:45
>Mark_Edelson: EGILNST O1 GENTLIS. +89 162
#note This was a very good phony by Mark though. I had no idea whether it was new, old or phony. Yet another reason I need to study more!
>Josh: AKLNORT N6 KA. +35 256
#note This turn was the one that left me the most torn out of all. I hated leaving LNORT on my rack, even though the pool was vowel heavy, but I also didn't want to make a play that opened any part of the board since I was ahead more than a bingo. What would you do? Any play leaves you vulnerable somehow... KO(A)LA C9? That is less variant than KA(T) at least. I saw that with an I draw I was very much safe as (H)ORNT(A)IL was playable at C6. 17:00
>Mark_Edelson: EF M7 F.E +21 183
>Josh: ILNOORT 1H ROOTLIN. +80 336
#note Possibly the best draw I had all tournament. This puts me virtually too far ahead for any sort of comeback, barring a miracle. Mark commented that perhaps I was going to beat him by 300 this game. 16:42.
>Mark_Edelson: AO 7G A.O +12 195
#note This play really settled things for me.
>Josh: ?CEEIVZ 2F ZEE +34 370
#note And this draw. Obviously not playing B11 (J)EEZ for 6 more here!!! But I should probably just play K5 pEC(t)IZE for 64 and pull way too far ahead. I missed that. 15:54.
>Mark_Edelson: AA 7B AA +13 208
>Josh: ?CEINPV J7 N.VI +14 384
#note Really playing extremely safe here. Didn't want a 2x2 and two more bingos from Mark. 13:53
>Mark_Edelson: EMNU D11 .UMEN +16 224
>Josh: ?CEIPRU 15C U.PRICEd +83 467
#note It's a good thing Mark played here, because I was going to play (O)PERCUlI* L8, confusing with OPERCULA... 11:08
>Mark_Edelson: EIMNRST 14I REMINTS +77 301
#note Missing MINSTER, Mark said he was also doubting MINTERS. I would be doubting my whole Scrabble hobby if I were Mark here... :P

>Mark_Edelson: DENU 8A UNDE +30 331
>Josh: ACILRSV 12G SCRIVAL +85 574
>Josh: ACILRSV --  -85 489
#note I knew this was greedy, but I thought it was SCRIVAL*, not SCRIBAL. SCRIBAL is the word here.
>Mark_Edelson: AGIOP O12 PI.O +27 358
#note -2 to 13K AGO
>Josh: ACILRSV L11 CIV.L +22 511
#note -6 to 5K CAVI(L) forming I(KAT).
>Mark_Edelson: AG 14F AG +12 370
#note There you have it. How Josh wins tournaments...
