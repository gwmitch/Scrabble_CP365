>Mark_Edelson: FKLNU 8D FLUNK +32 32
#note Although the board position after 8D FLUNK is slightly superior to that after 8H FLUNK, you also have to score points in Scrabble apparently, so it looks like 34 points edges 32 points out.

#note !!!
>Josh: ?GOOQXY I6 OXY +37 69
#note I did not consider not dropping my X here, as I don't want to ever keep QX if I don't have to. But QOG is just as unbalanced as QOX is, and the X can actually score points. I therefore should have played A8 GO(B)Y. It is not intuitive me to play, let alone search for a play like GO(B)Y here, but I have much to learn. I did understand that the B in BROMANCE was the biggest threat here, so that accounts for more than seven points, but I didn't realize that QOG? was much worse for scoring and also worse for drawing into an improbable bingo (!). I just autopiloted into not keeping two huge clunkers at once with a blank. It is true that neither play is very good, but GO(B)Y was definitely correct.
>Mark_Edelson: AEIIL A10 .AILIE +27 127
>Josh: ?AGNOPQ 5I PONG +30 99
#note It was interesting to try and compare plays here. PONG was 30, left me outs for my Q and took away the biggest spot on the board, but the Q is such a liability that it must have been worth at least 10 points to get rid of it with Q(U)ANG(O) or Q(U)AG. The board position after QUANGO looks better than that after QUAG, but PON? is definitely better than PO?, so those plays were also close. I would choose QUANGO over QUAG here. But I ultimately gave in to the points again here, and I don't know if it was correct to. My chances of getting a bingo next turn are very good if I play QUAG, and that's very important here...

>Josh: ?BFIIMV 6I .F +26 177
#note I just didn't know what to do here, so I decided to just take the points and hope for something next turn. I was already debating whether or not VIBRIUM was a word at this point, and I wasn't sure what I would be confusing it with. Apparently B(U)MF is the play here according to Quackle. I think that's completely stupid. I don't have an S, my leave is horrendous and I am closing a lane. Apparently I draw into a bingo 1/3 of the time after BUMF. I think that's an exaggeration. I think I should have just gone with VIM(S) N8, because although that also blocks a lane, it keeps scoring and bingo possibilities alive for next turn. OF is just a delay. I can't really afford a delay at this point.

>Josh: ?BIIMSV --  -76 177
#note And I make a colossal mistake. At least Mark thought a while before challenging. I don't know why I keep doing these things in tournaments when I have other viable options.
>Mark_Edelson: ILR 3J RI.L +8 225
>Josh: ?BIIMSV N8 VIM. +15 192
#note I really just need to play (L)IMBI or (L)IMB 13A. Missed both, but was focused on preventing yet another successful >10-point play + a bingo by Mark. :(

#note Damn, I was ready to drop the bomb with (Q)UIP. Sound decision by Mark to block the Q. Looking grim here, and I thought this was a mistake afterwards, but I need to go for at least the A or the Z to score here. PUGH for 25 just won't cut it most of the time.
>Mark_Edelson: ADEZ D12 DAZE +43 399
#note I had missed the A hook though (I would have noticed if I drew the A, but don't miss stuff like that!)
>Josh: INOPTUV 15D .NVOI +24 374
#note Spent an eternity here and still got it wrong. This is 8 points better than ENVOI, as it sets up PUT for 32. That's 13 for VINO + 32 for PUT which yields 45, vs. 24 for (E)NVOI + 13 for TUP which yields 37. VINO might also cause Mark to blow the game though, perhaps due to miscalculation or overthinking.
