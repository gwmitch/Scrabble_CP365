#note Quackle slightly prefers 9G ONAGERS
>Cheah: DFOU 6K FOUD +21 53
>Hubert: EIKOSUW 8M EUK +24 96
#note 8M EWK, 7C KOW, O6 SOUK simulate 3-7 pts better

>Hubert: EIORSWW 5H WOW +16 112
#note Somehow managed to miss H9 WOW for 6 more pts

#note Best
>Cheah: ?AEMPXY 15A YMP. +33 109
>Hubert: CCDGNTZ E5 C.G.T +18 204
#note 2nd best and more or less equal to 11C CINCT. Keeps the Z for the I9 and 13 C hotspots.
>Cheah: AELX C10 AXEL +39 148
>Hubert: CDENRUZ 9I ZED +46 250
#note Sim favors N8 UNCURED by a bit  but wasn't comfortable with opening up more floaters when leading. 10A CZAR not far behind
>Cheah: ?ABLNOT 4I NOTABLe +73 221
>Hubert: CENRTTU 10F CRUET +33 283
#note Best.
>Cheah: IILV F10 .IVIL +12 233
>Hubert: IIINSTY -IIY +0 283
#note Bad pickup of IIISY here, despite Cheah's previous play potentially telegraphing another I. Exchanging IIY is slightly behind 3J YIN. Noted that was just a single tile away from (V)ICINITY 
>Cheah: EO 14A OE +17 250
>Hubert: EIIINST -II +0 283
#note Not again. Exchanging sims close to best here, as there are no options to dump 2 Is.
>Cheah: AEIORST 12F .OTARIES +74 324
>Hubert: BEINPST O1 BIN. +15 298
#note A poor choice of moves here. 3J NIB creating another -S line is noticeably better. The bag is still extremely I-heavy with 4 Is in 21 tiles
>Cheah: INVY B7 VINY +32 356
>Hubert: ?DEPQST A8 Qi +64 362
#note  Probably a major strategic error here. Saving the blank for 31 pts sims much better, as opponent is unlikely to fully block the CIVIL-S bingo lane and ?DEPST is very fruitful.
>Cheah: AEHN 11K HAEN +28 384
>Hubert: DEELPST I12 .L +3 365
#note The bingo doesn't play here.Another error, should have simply played SPELD/CIVILS instead of attempting to set up a blockable outpbingo. Considered J3 TOW but it doesn't result in unblockable bingos after picking an I. As it is, SPELD would have resulted in a drawn game.
