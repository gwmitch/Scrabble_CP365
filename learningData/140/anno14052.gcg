#note Chickened on SALTNESS.  was sure there was a bingo in it, but thought it might be LASTNESS.  Was about 75% on SALTNESS.  But, it looks weird enough that it might draw a challenge 25% of the time.  Should I still try SALTNESS?

#note The bag is vowel heavy, and there aren't many bingo lines left.  Champ says 3C OPINE for pts and v-c balance (lots of I's and N's left).  I thought this gave me a shot at opening another line
