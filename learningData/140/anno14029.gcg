>Geoff: IIJORUV 8G ROJI +22 22
#note Oh my god what is this garbage...ROJI# barely beats out JOUR# and ex. 6, though RIVO#, which I didn't think of, does a half point better.
>Quackle: EEFHLNN 7C FENNEL +19 19
>Geoff: EEITUVX 8B VEX +43 65
>Quackle: CHINNOW 9C WON +33 52
>Geoff: AEGIITU 9I ATIGI +20 85
#note Best of a bad lot. AUGITE 10E 13 is the play if you're TWLing.
>Quackle: CDHIINT L2 DITCHIN. +82 134
>Geoff: AAABEEU 10H ABA +24 109
#note Uh...uh...me want points! I saw AUBA(D)E, but I'm not doing that, and BEAU K1 13 didn't seem worth the 11-point sacrifice and closed board. Didn't think of BA(T)EAU for 9, which wins a short sim. Ex 6 is right behind; ABA is about -3.

>Quackle: ADEGIOR D7 ...DOI +28 194
>Geoff: AINPSTT N4 TIP +25 155
#note TAP is better here - 4 As vs. 2 Is, a C to bingo to, INST > ANST anyway.
>Quackle: AEGLRTV 11C G.V +14 208
>Geoff: ADHNQST 7K Q.N +13 168
#note Ah, didn't see ADHANS# for 42. QIN# actually beats it, though.

>Quackle: AELORRT 12G RELATOR. +68 286
>Geoff: AEFORUU 15L FA.E +36 287
#note Dear Geoff, FADO is a word, thanks bye. Clean the rack for nothing here, or score and pray? FOUAT# 4H 12 is Quackle's choice.

>Geoff: ??IMORU 11K UM +16 342
#note Ooh, COUMARIC! Shanked it. More costly in real life than here, since Speedy might not block next turn.
