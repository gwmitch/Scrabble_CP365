#note Need to study more CSW 5s.  There is a 40 point play here: 4H TAIRA#/IDENT#/AVOWS.

D11 AREIC is the desperate play to tear the board open as quickly as possible.  Often playing like this will let him put me away right away.  It hinges on the hope that he won't have a big play on this turn, and that I'll draw something big on the next turn.  Instead, I play to prolong the game and maneuver for a late bingo.

#note I liked this better than POI N6 to keep more bingo lines open, although that would have given me some chances to draw into EXACTERS/EXACTORS.  But I thought it was more likely that he would take out the X tile than the M and N columns for bingos, and for those the C isn't really helping me.  Also, a bingo by itself isn't going to be enough.  I need every point I can get.  The downside of my play is that I'd much rather keep the A than the O, given that there are three more O's and only one A unseen.  I was disappointed that my T tile wasn't an S for EXOCARPS here.

#note MOOT keeps a better leave, but this makes it harder for him to close all bingo lines, especially if I draw the S.
>Amit_Chakrabarti: EEGILNR 14B EL.IGNER +76 465
#note Oh well, there's the ballgame.  I battled through tough racks early and kept myself in striking distance until my final draw.  It's important not to focus on failing to get the lucky draw at the end, but instead on what I could have done earlier in the game to improve my chances: notably BLAZONER, LUVS and TAIRA#.
