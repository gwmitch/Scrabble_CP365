#note What a luckbag.

#note Rut-roh!!!
>Winter: AEEIIIS -AEIII +0 69
#note Thought about I(L)IA, but that's a punk play.
>Tim_Bottorff: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 84
#note Whew!
>Winter: ?DEEQST O1 QuE.TED +48 117
#note Torn between playing Q(I), but why not take the lead and the momentum on this board, that is not that bingo friendly anymore.
>Tim_Bottorff: FOU N6 FOU +30 114
>Winter: AORRSUV 6F VA.OUR +19 136
#note With the momentum, I try to make it harder for him to bino.
>Tim_Bottorff: AAAA -AAAA +0 114
#note That's what I like to see.
>Winter: AOORSTT 9L TORO +12 148
#note Okay, I suck.

#note Wow, Quackle really hates MYTH.
>Tim_Bottorff: BDIIN 7B BINDI +16 175
>Winter: AEEINSS 15K AS.EN +27 219
#note I figured Quackle would like S(H)EA, but I've got the momentum, so why not take out that FOAL ess hook in case he hits it with the blank? I no longer care about maximizing spread, but simply not losing the game.

>Tim_Bottorff: EY 14M .YE +24 259
#note Damn, but he's getting close!!!
>Winter: ?CEIOSW J11 OW +20 280
#note I can pull it out without a bingo, but still, bingo is better. Leaving CEIS? is a slam dunk in my opinion, even if Quackle disagrees.
