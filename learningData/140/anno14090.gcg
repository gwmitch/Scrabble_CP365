#note i don't know if it makes more sense here to keep the X so i can score next turn and then bingo. keeping M? only sims a point ahead of X?

#note even though i'm down and need to bingo i need to take this scoring spot instead of doing something like CUP/PEERIE. quackle likes TUPS better cuz it scores more mostly. (-1)

#note some moves to consider here: C9 AERO, C12 OVA, H12 EAVE. i wanted to make it harder for her to block and/or create a somewhat distracting lane. i think i like EAVE better though, i need points. i do have to turn over 3 tiles because i almost certainly need the blank to win. (-4)

#note i wasn't sure enough of quinary. quackle likes my play by far, i have a great chance of bingoing, but it feels like i should win many times with quinary. she can't overlap from A12 down. i guess something like A12 FAB still would hurt a lot, or ABY.
