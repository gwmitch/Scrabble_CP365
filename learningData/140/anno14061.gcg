#note Debated this or HENRY. I hated the easy overlaps this gave back, but figured my Y would be solid after a lot of his overlaps. This is indeed better than HENRY, but the top-simming play is HUE, which I didn't consider. Gives very little back and promises to score well next turn. Makes sense.

#note I'm not sure... E's are at a premium, but there's no guarantee at this point that I absolutely need a bingo. Leaving the F opens will ensure that I need a bingo, I think. FOULED would be close, I knew, but they are simming neck-and-neck. With the unkillable E and the tough-to-close bottom half, I felt comfortable hedging my bets. But I will need some good tiles either way.

#note Probably the trickiest position of the game. It's still not 100% certain that I need to bingo. So again I'm hedging my bets. This play leans more towards assuming I'll need to bingo. Though PAD kind of suggests that good stuff is still in the bag. So maybe I should turn over more tiles with GROWLS. I dunno, though. The other play I strongly considered was OW, but that seemed too risky.

#note Some huge missed here. DRESSAGE is definitely safer and K8 SERFAGES is better still. Those could have cost me. 1G LARGESSE outsims this, but screw that.
