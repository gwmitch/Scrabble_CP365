>Richard_Kirsch: BCGINOU 8D CUBING +28 28
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEELN H6 EN.EALED +60 60
#note OK so first turn, I overdraw and he steals my blank. But I see ENNEALED* and play it pretty quickly. I didn't like NEEDABLE*. Scored as 62...
>Richard_Kirsch: DOPRRU 12C PROUD.R +20 48
#note Richard held for a bit but didn't challenge. Lucky me, confusing it with ANNEALED.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFOORT D2 FOOTRA.E +76 136
#note Nice little find here.
>Richard_Kirsch: ?EIINOS J5 NOISIEr +72 120
>Richard_Kirsch: ?EIINOS --  -72 48
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIORTW C2 OW +25 161
#note WRA(P)T is nice here, but I want him to bingo this turn so I can 3x3. I'm also too lazy to search for (D)EcISION/(D)ErISION. He has SIn(F)ONIE, but neither one of us knew that one.
>Richard_Kirsch: ?EIINOS 13H .EcISION +71 119
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAIRTZ O7 ATRAZI.e +101 262
#note Well, the bait worked! I couldn't have drawn anything better! But wait, I MISS TZARI(N)AS. I MISS IT. COME ON.
>Richard_Kirsch: AY N9 AY +28 147
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAEEMP -AAAMPEE +0 262
#note Didn't know PAMPA and I want to draw the S to seal the victory.
>Richard_Kirsch: JT E11 J.T +20 167
>Joshua_Sokol: BOOQXY N4 BOXY +37 299
#note Don't remember my last tile. OXY 1A is by far the best here though, but I missed the spot.
>Richard_Kirsch: EKNU O1 NUKE +32 199
>Joshua_Sokol: EHOQRST 15J OTHERS +90 389
#note I was actually considering being ultra-greedy and playing Q(I) here, because others bingos with a lot. But I resisted the temptation, even though he didn't draw an S the whole rest of the game.
>Richard_Kirsch: AGIL 14B GLIA +21 220
#note Never seen GLIA before, but I didn't challenge. Richard plays boggle, so he would know.
>Joshua_Sokol: DNOQRSV -VQDR +0 389
#note V(E)NOS(E) is cute. I'm greedy. Wrong trade though.
>Richard_Kirsch: EGHIITT L6 TIGHTIE. +78 298
>Richard_Kirsch: EGHIITT --  -78 220
#note Tighty whities, he said! Sorry, Richard, nice try.
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNOSV 15H SO...... +33 422
#note I put down OVALNES(S). I then proceeded to take it off, thinking it was ridiculous. Turns out it was good. Wow.
>Richard_Kirsch: IT F8 .IT +7 227
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILNV 6D .EV +14 436
#note I miss the -OW hook again. (R)EV is pretty solid though. Quackle likes VEN(T)AIL with an EGHIT inference.
>Richard_Kirsch: EGHIT 5C E.H +22 249
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILNR L6 ALIENER. +68 504
>Richard_Kirsch: EFLP K3 PELF +23 272
>Joshua_Sokol: AADMQUV L1 QUAD +58 562
>Richard_Kirsch: CGIIMNT B3 TIMING +26 298
#note MIC is best here.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADMSVW 1A VAW +36 598
#note OK, so here I didn't track, and I thought that I could have C stuck him once he played PA(C) but no, he also had (C)OW and (I)C(E) so I didn't make the wrong play.
>Richard_Kirsch: C 3K ..C +14 312
#note Turns out my first 600 game wasn't actually a 600 game! What a bummer!
>Richard_Kirsch:  (DMS) +12 324
