>Will: ADOOOVY 7H OY +11 11
#note I don't normally make plays like this but the defense of this play seemed so good.
>Frank: BOP 6F BOP +18 40
>Will: ADEOOUV -AOOUV +0 11
#note Now I should do UVEA, BOP doesn't signify much strength given the weakness of the board...it mostly means he happened to have a P.
>Frank: III -III +0 40

>Will: ADEFJRS 10C J.FE +25 71
#note Really hoped to hit ZETAS next turn, hence no JEFES here. JEED looks fine too.

#note After my super-aggressive opening Frank is saddled with consonants, but blocks AIRWAVES!
>Frank: ANOTX 15E TAXON +45 264

#note The next trial: the II draw

#note Finally got to lay that hammer down.

>Will: GILORST E2 IL. +7 270
#note Lots of -ISM words still play down col. M, but if I fish elsewhere without making a new threat, Frank will just block everything up in that area and that will be that. If I play ILK and draw E? or I? I can at least get close with ERGOTISM after most normal blocks...after YOGIS/SILK I squeak out a win but I still lose to GREYS/SILK.
