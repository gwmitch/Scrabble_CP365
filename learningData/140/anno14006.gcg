>Bob: UUUU -UUUU +0 0
>Rafi: EIIJOTU 8H JEU +20 20
#note I liked this placement after an exchange, making bingoes to the E score less and preventing 7s starting over or under the U.
>Bob: CIKOPST I3 POCKI.ST +71 71
>Rafi: AGIILOT 5C OTALGI. +20 40
#note GAOL is worth consideration here. GAOL scores best and the IIT isn't terrible with an ING spot and 6 N's unseen. I'm not a big fan of what it does to the board though - I like the openness of OTALGIC.

>Rafi: BEELLNS 3L BEL +14 155
#note I thought this was a pretty cool play, setting up my case L with only one T unseen.
>Bob: GO 9G GO. +15 173
>Rafi: DEEHLNS F9 EH +18 173
#note I thought it was a good idea to block the best lane that he just created, holding off using BELL until later. Not sure if this was worthwhile though... I sacrificed 18 points!
>Bob: ?IRZ O1 RItZ +71 244
#note And then this happens. Ouch.

>Bob: AANO 14E ANOA +19 269
>Rafi: FGHIOTW 13M OF +20 296
#note I only thought of CURARI and completely missed the O hook. Luckily, this was the first turn that it affected me. I played OF to set up the last T with the chance of drawing WEIGHT or WRIGHT. Puts the pressure on. 
>Bob: ADN 14M DAN +25 294
>Rafi: GHIORTW 8A GROWTH +60 356
>Bob: AQ J2 QA. +36 330
>Rafi: CEEIMOP B8 .OPE +12 368
#note Champ player likes POEM/MAS best, which I didn't think of. I was only looking for blocks underlapping GROWTH or using the R. ROPE is still decent though, giving me a nice out-in-two and potentially baiting a phoney out bingo attempt.
