>Eric: DEEELNT -E +0 0
#note Odd spot.  I bingo through AGIST, but there aren't many 8s. Sim will be inaccurate, as Rafi will often exchange after I exchage 1.  8G DELE looks standard.
>Rafi: AEEIORT -EO +0 0
#note Normally I would keep AERT or EIRT (probably the former) but with a good chance of having 3 or 4 useful consonants to play through, I preferred keeping the extra vowel. This might actually be a situation where playing OE is beneficial... it would reduce the score of Eric's bingoes and doesn't increase his bingo chances very much.
>Eric: DEEELNT -E +0 0
#note Draw another E, try again
>Rafi: AEEIIRT -EI +0 0
>Eric: DEEELNT 8F DEL +8 8
#note Draw another E.  I want to minimize damage, so I set the L to reduce his access to the x3.
>Rafi: AEINORT H1 ORIENTA. +77 77
#note Wow... DELINEATOR would have been incredible! If only I studied the top 10 letter word by probability.
>Eric: CEENNOT 2D NONE.ECT +68 76
>Eric: CEENNOT --  -68 8
#note "I suck at Scrabble"
>Rafi: AEGJORS G1 JO +20 97
#note Blocking NEOTENIC and CRETONNE. I liked this over JAR or RAJ because after Eric plays CON or CONE or something, the board is somewhat closed, whereas he can play the more open ONCE/JO or CENTO/JO with my other plays. JIG is another good option that I should have considered. Quackle likes JAR/RAJ/JIG a lot better than my play.
>Eric: CEENNOT F2 CONE +23 31
#note CONTEND, CONTE are a bit better.
>Rafi: AAEGPRS E3 GAP +25 122
>Eric: EGMNORT D4 MOG +27 58
>Rafi: AEHLLRS G7 H.AL +21 143
#note Based on the score and the board, I prefer playing this over HELL/HALL because of the O hook. I also liked keeping the right side of the board closed. LAH(A)R, which I didn't see, looks best to me.

>Rafi: EILQRSU J7 QUI. +22 165
>Eric: EILNRRW K4 REWIN +29 120
>Rafi: ?EEELRS L8 SLEEkER +68 233
#note I was pretty sure of SLEEKERS when I played this, but not 100%.
>Eric: AEILRVY 14J VE.ILY +40 160
#note Didn't spot VIRAL, which keeps the EY for GEY next turn.

>Rafi: AAEGOPY 6B PO.EY +50 481
>Eric: ACMNOST 13G TOM +21 277
#note Eric put MOSCA(DEL) down, but then thought better of it and picked it up. MUSCADEL is the word.
>Rafi: AADEGIO N6 GOA +13 494
#note Knowing that Eric was holding only one S (otherwise MASCOTS would have come down) I liked leaving ADEI in hopes of hitting a bingo myself. The pool is pretty raggedy here, so Eric's CAS_  isn't going to bingo often. Also thought of ADAGIO, which might have been better. AGIO is another good option.
>Eric: AACDNSU C5 D.C +16 293
#note Should give up and just play CAD or something else here.
>Rafi: ABDEIIW 1G ..W +13 507
#note One of the funnier mistakes I've made - I was fishing for an S for DIABASE... except that I had two I's!!! WAITED looks good here.
