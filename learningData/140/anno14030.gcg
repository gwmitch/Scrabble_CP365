>Quackle: DGIPQST -DGQ +0 0
>Geoff: AHLOTUU 8F OUTHAUL +72 72
#note Quackle wants me to play it at 8G. Says 8F makes me score less next time. Have to think about that one.
>Quackle: EIPSTWY M8 SWIPEY +47 47
>Geoff: ?DEMOST K4 DEMO.nTS +90 162
#note COSTUMED is the other 2x2, and I should have played it.
>Quackle: AABGNOT L11 OBANG +38 85
>Geoff: ABDEGIW 15J BA.WIG +39 201
#note Any game with BAGWIG on the board can't be all bad.
>Quackle: AAIIOPT 9G PIA +24 109
>Geoff: DEORRRU 4I OR.URE +14 215
#note Rack micromanagement alert! Taking points on the L column would have been better.
>Quackle: ADILOTV 10E VIOLD +26 135
>Geoff: DEFHILR N9 EF +31 246
#note Spent time on this one...didn't see EDH in the same spot, though. I liked keeping H here with some spots for it, but DHILR is probably worse than DFILR...HM for 15?

>Geoff: DHIIJLR M2 JI.D +24 270
#note J2, dude.
>Quackle: AEFINTZ 3G FIZ +50 224
>Geoff: HILORTU N1 HOT. +34 304
#note Nowhere for my UROLITH to go (and that's a bad thing!)

>Quackle: EENRSVY 5E YEVEN +35 296
>Geoff: ?CILORU 6B CLOUR +24 359
#note Yay blanks. I might have done better to keep it tight here - the pool's bingo-prone, and if Q bingos and I don't...
>Quackle: AELNRST B6 .ENTRALS +62 358
>Geoff: ?AEGIIS E10 .IGA +16 375
#note This felt like a blunder when I made it, but Quackle rates it second only to 12A GLEI# (which I didn't come up with). 
>Quackle: ADEMNRR 13K R.. +6 364
>Geoff: ?EEINNS A7 NIE +19 394
#note My tiles are too good to lose here. Q prefers NE in various places - I'd guess keeping both E and I is a good idea given my likelihood of picking a consonant...
