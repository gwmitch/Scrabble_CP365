#note I knew I was sacrificing equity, but Jeremy likes to challenge me, so I thought it was worth a try. He knows words, though, so no luck, and that's a lot of wasted equity for nothing. BIG is the play.

#note Damn. I wrote down JADELIKE and talked myself out of it. That probably gets a challenge, too. Ugh.... I also did not like 11A JAILED for giving back easy points. So I decided to kill the hot spot on row 14. JADELIKE, man.

#note Again a word knowledge flunk... I talked myself out of SIRENIANS. This play is fine, though I would have liked to be sure of the hooks on the board.
