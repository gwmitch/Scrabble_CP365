>E_Tran: AILOQTY 9F TOY +22 22
#note I kinda like ALIYOT somewhere: it might draw a challenge, or a pluralization.  TOY is the safe/standard play.

#note Chickened out on HILA.  Being behind a bingo, I preferred an exchange, instead of a 14 pt plays, keeping an ugly leave.   keeping AH or ADH does a little better - maybe because of JOT.
>Ed_D: EGIMOU 6E MEOUI.G +12 166
>E_Tran: AEHNNOW 5E HAW +39 134
#note I make this instead of HOW to preserve the O for OHM.  Also, a lot of O's had been seen.  A long sim agrees.
>Ed_D: DEESU 11G SUEDE +23 189
>E_Tran: EENNOOP 4C POON +23 157
#note This sets up a SPOON hook I might need.  With a lot of E's left, and O's gone, might not be worth it.  Sim says its close (with PEON)

>E_Tran: DEEIILN L11 DIE +16 203
#note Didn't know HONIED.  Decided against HOIDEN.  I should be more risky here and play it.  
>Ed_D: IVV 13I VIV. +14 256
>E_Tran: AEILLNP 2A PAL +23 226
#note 2B ELAIN is a good play.  I wanted to open bingo lines, so made this instead of LAP
>Ed_D: ?ABEIIR 1C fIBRIAE +82 338
#note Noooooo!  Ed played this so confidently.  I really didn't like it, but decided to go with my read.  Really though, my win% goes down so much if this stays.  Need to reassess all the variables and challenge here.

>Ed_D: AGR 15A RAG. +18 356
>E_Tran: AEEELNS 14L LEE +11 261
#note I'm hoping Ed tacks an S on DIEL: this gives me a free turn, and a better chance at a comeback.  If necessary, I can tack it on myself and hope he doesn't challenge.
>Ed_D: ADRT O12 DART +25 381
>E_Tran: ACENRST 13C T.C +10 271
#note I can't win even if I phoney-bingo with DIELS.  I figure my only chance at winning is to empty the bag, hope he bingoes by making DIELS, I challenge, then bingo down A to sneak out a win.  crazy, but this was my thinking
>Ed_D: ?DEIRSU A9 sUDSIE. +8 389
#note Ed misses STURDIER (and RAGGEDIER)
>E_Tran: AEFINRS N6 INFARE +21 292
