#note (I'm actually going 2nd in this game, I just wanted to give a little context. I'm really pissed about the end of last game and repeating to myself "don't go on tilt, don't get pissed... don't go on tilt, don't get pissed..."
>Kevin_Leeds: ?GINQRU 8D QUIRiNG +102 102
#note Yeah, I'm pissed. 
>Matt_Canik: FMOOSTU G6 FO.UM +12 12
#note I don't know if I'm supposed to try to keep things really open or play for equity or what. Q seems to like FUG or FOG about two points better than this. 
>Kevin_Leeds: IJN 9C JIN +31 133
>Matt_Canik: AAEEOST C9 .OTAS +24 36
#note I know that when you're down you're just supposed to grab all the points you can and hope you get really lucky with your pulls. Is it too early for that? Do I play AEO(N) or AE here?
>Kevin_Leeds: CEEINRT 6G .RENETIC +71 204
#note I guess it doesn't matter what I do.

#note sooo lucky
>Kevin_Leeds: AIOZ 15A AZI.O +45 275
>Matt_Canik: ABEGLPR E11 GAB +23 172
#note I think this makes it a lot harder for him to block B and score without opening A, and the DJIN hooks is probably pretty important right now.

#note Pretty much every good play is along row 2... I kinda have to open?
>Kevin_Leeds: FHO 1F FOH +66 397
#note 66 points. Sixty-six.

#note Any vowel except U bingos at 11G,  consonants seem ok too.
