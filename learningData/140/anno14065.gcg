>Matthew_Larocque: AIMRSUY I8 .UY +9 9
#note I missed MYRIA(D) which is one of the only plays that scores well here. I still like the fishy play here though. Sim agrees.
>Hugette_Settle: ?EFGORT 11C FORGETs +78 150
#note Well, this is going to be a tough one.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIIMRS 12A GRAM +31 40
#note Maybe I ought to fish again with MAIRS. I'm so far behind with no blanks left that I'm going to need some quick luck.

>Matthew_Larocque: DDIISTT 9L .D +5 138
#note Since this is a casual game I thought I'd try something stupid. An E will give me DITTIES or TIDIEST, one of the remaining Os will give me OTITID(E)S. Also I discovered that an H would form STITHI(E)D. It means to forge on an anvil.
>Hugette_Settle: IKLN K5 LIK.N +20 240
>Matthew_Larocque: DIINSTT L2 NITID +17 155
#note Just play DIT maybe? I know she'll block it anyways though. But I want to keep my leave strong to bingo.
>Hugette_Settle: BEERSST N8 BESTERS +77 317
>Hugette_Settle: BEERSST --  -77 240
>Matthew_Larocque: HNOSTYZ J12 HOY +25 180
#note I needed a break like that, but I missed THY. Didn't want to play Z(I)N here, because wanted to get rid of the stupid Y first. And I might fluke into ZO(N)ES or ZI(N)ES or something. Which would have been a lot more likely if I had played THY keeping the O.
>Hugette_Settle: BEERSST M12 REB +17 257
#note If she dumps the B here, she'll probably draw a bingo next turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: CENNSTZ 3K Z.N +24 204
>Hugette_Settle: EMSST N2 MET +23 280
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEENST N6 CETENES +80 284
#note Desperation bingo....
>Hugette_Settle: IQSS O1 QIS +54 334
#note Huguette takes the sure points.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFOORU O7 FA +26 310
#note I think I forgot about the ZINES hook here. Didn't get whole rack.
>Hugette_Settle: ALW F13 AWL +19 353
>Matthew_Larocque: LNOORUU -LOUU +0 310
#note Here you can have this junk. Sim prefers keeping nothing or just R. OU(R) sets up another bingo spot.
>Hugette_Settle: CRSU 15C CUR. +7 360
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEENOR 6E A.E +6 316
#note AE/AZINES is hard to block completely unless she has the V.
>Hugette_Settle: AHST 5C HAT +16 376
#note She rejected HAT J2 for obvious reasons.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEJNORV 4A JEON +47 363
#note I almost played JAR J2 but then switched to this quickly. Turns out there was an A in the bag, so JAR sets up the outplay NOVAE!
>Hugette_Settle: LOSSTUU A4 .OUST +36 412
#note  And prevents her from doing this too. I think she went into overtime here. If I play JAR last turn, she has to find something like SULUS 4B really fast which I doubt she would. Also, S(E)TULOUS holy crap.
>Matthew_Larocque: AARV J2 VAR +29 392
>Hugette_Settle: LSU C11 ..S +18 430
#note She didn't have time to find any outplays.
>Matthew_Larocque: A J12 ...A +10 402
>Matthew_Larocque:  (LU) +4 406
#note She lost 10 points. So, I'm sure that JAR would have won me the game.... ugh.... oh well, I was totally expecting to get blown out here!
