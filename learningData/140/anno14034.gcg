#note Didn't think of RENEGUER#, which I would have played. Nothing scores more than 68, but many other choices would be a bit better than this.

>Geoff: AEHILOP L10 OPAH +32 114
#note Hello beer! OPAH L12 is more, you know. And it blocks the S hook you needlessly created, too.

#note FAIL ditches another vowel.

#note I decided to hold the E instead of playing UVEA, figuring I'd need it. I ruled out 3G VAU too quickly - it closes that lane, yeah, but there are others.
