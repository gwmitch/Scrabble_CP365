>Sid: DEGIOOY H8 GOOEY +26 26
#note Playing my dad again. This was the highest scoring game I've ever had. He's really improved especially as of late since Houston, and he can put up a fight. Not this game though, he COMPLETELY loses it. He could never draw a rack and never stops fishing.

GOOEY is best.
>Dad: OW 10F WO. +14 14
>Sid: DINOOPT 11B OPTION.D +79 105
#note Only bingo.
>Dad: N F10 ..N +6 20
>Sid: FLW 9G F.WL +28 133
#note Don't remember my rack, but it was all consonants and the play was obvious.
>Dad: E 12H .E +8 28
>Sid: ELNORVX 13I VOLE +22 155
#note Figured I would set myself up for a big X play next turn if I could draw the I.
>Dad: ADEMS 14J MADES +43 71
>Dad: ADEMS --  -43 28
#note Held for about 2 minutes, and i was 95% sure this wasn't good... I also wanted my cheap X play :)
>Sid: INRX 14J XI +52 207
#note :)

>Dad: ?ADEJSU D6 ADJUS.Er +96 152
#note nice play! best is m7 judases 118
>Sid: ?AEIRRR D4 RE........ +34 293
#note Figured this would be a tough challenge. No bingo here, so this is a nice scoring option.
>Dad: I J9 .I +4 156
>Sid: ?AAFIRR B2 AIRFARe +75 368
#note AIRFRA(ME)S is the only other bingo, which I didn't know. AFAR for 34 is probably the smarter play, but who cares :)
>Dad: I 12L .I +4 160
>Sid: AENNSTU 8D .UN +10 378
#note Missed NAUSEANT, but other than that, this actually sims best.
>Dad: G 2B .G +3 163
>Sid: AAENSTV F6 VA. +14 392
#note Best, even sims better than vesta for 37!
>Dad: B 7F .B +7 170
>Sid: AEENRST K4 NEAREST +77 469
#note Best.
>Dad: Z 2A Z.. +13 183
>Sid: CDEEU 15K DEUCE +31 500
>Dad: C -  +0 183
#note He exchanged 2 on this turn. He said he pretty much gave up after AIRFARE. He normally doesn't endlessly fish but he wasn't in the mood. He can put up a fight though.
>Sid: GIMNOSS M11 M.S +26 526
#note Chickened out on MOSSING.
>Dad: ACKLO J2 CLOAK +47 230
>Sid: GHINORS 15B SHORING +95 621
#note Only bingo.
>Dad: DEILTU N6 DILUTE +17 247
>Sid: AEIIQTT 14F QI +64 685
#note Lucky me.
>Dad: TY O13 TY. +6 253
#note He actually played Y(ON) and hit the clock, but he found TYE afterwards, and I let him change his play. I could have gotten to 705 with ETA! 
>Dad:  (AEITT) +10 263
#note My highest scoring game ever, but it wasn't fair. He was tired and didn't try, but he can usually compete at least at a 1100-1200 level. Definitely improving, and some of our games come down to the wire.
