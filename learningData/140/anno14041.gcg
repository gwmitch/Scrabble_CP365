#note I'm playing my dad in a casual game with regular tournament conditions. We're preparing for the nationals. He's really improved since the Houston Open :)
>Dad: FI I7 IF +16 16
>Sid: EEGHLNT J8 THEN +15 27
#note No idea what to do here, as I didn't know MOTTE.

#note Weird play here, but scores nevertheless.
>Dad: A 7G A.. +6 48
>Sid: DEGNSTY N12 G.Y +14 104
#note I know he's fishing, so i thought this was a good defensive play while still managing my rack. Still, far inferior to EDGY, bad miss.
>Dad: ?ACEPSU 14B UnCAPES +84 132
>Dad: ?ACEPSU --  -84 48
#note lol
>Sid: ADENRST F1 STANDER +68 172
#note Only bingo.
>Dad: ?ACEPSU 1C CAP.UlES +86 134
#note nice find, but he missed campuses for 176!
>Sid: EEGINNS 8G S...ENING +44 216
#note Engines was a bad miss, but this is the highest scoring non-bingo play. And style points ;)
>Dad: IJ N6 JI. +26 160
>Sid: EHIQRRT 7M Q. +42 258
#note Best.
>Dad: U 10G U. +2 162
>Sid: EHILRRT F9 THIR +29 287
#note Since I was ahead, I wanted to play this for 29 rather than hirer for 45. The F lane is much easier to bingo on than the 2 lane, so I needed to block. THIRL is far better though, because the 14 lane is still wide open.
>Dad: DEIRV 5J RIVED +30 192

#note No idea what to do here, didn't know thirl.
>Dad: ?AILOPT 14B cAPITOL +72 264
#note Nice.
>Sid: AEEORRW O11 WORE +25 328
#note REWON 4B 32 is the play. This isn't bad though.
>Dad: EFLOWY 12A FLOWE.Y +40 304
#note Great play.
>Sid: AAEEKRU 13C KA +34 362
#note Don't know what to do here again, so I went for points... horrible leave though, and it would hurt
>Dad: INZ 4B ZIN +32 336
>Sid: AEEIRUU J1 .UE +5 367
#note Questionable play here, but I had reason behind it. I was so sure he was going to play ZAX next turn, so I wanted to set myself up for an AUREI finish along the triple. Knowing my dad, I don't think he would have seen COXA(L) or COXA(E), so I figured ZAX was his only scoring option, and otherwise I would win anyway. But I completely missed that a smarter play for him would just be AX B5 32! Incredible.
>Dad: ACDNOX 5B AD +20 356
#note Very interesting play... he figured out that ZAX just going down would have been a bad play, but instead of doing AX B5 32, he attempts a 60 point ZAX setup, haha.
>Sid: AEIRU B4 ..IRE +16 383
#note The only block.
>Dad: CNOX A8 OX +33 389
>Sid: AU 3J .AU +3 386
#note The only outplay.
>Sid:  (CN) +8 394
#note This was a very unusual game, because there were scoring errors that changed the outcome of the game. STANDER was scored as 67 rather than 68, CAPSULES as 83 rather than 88, and CAPITOL as 82 rather than 72. And, on one turn, we BOTH added wrong to get the same wrong number (how about that!). I actually lost this game my 1 point when we were playing (393-394). Since EAU was the only out, nothing else was worth it. We never recounted, so he took it as a win... bizarre!
