#note BAGIE would have given me AREAWAY with a potential X-bomb the next move. I think I might have opened with BAGIE myself, because exposing the I is more susceptible to a 2x2 than an A in that position, and opening the A to the DLS is slightly worse than opening an I. Still, it worked out for David.

#note This was certainly the turning point of the game, and I deliberated long about this move, before making the wrong play. While this simulates about 2 points better than the next best option (7M DOO), I can't help but think that David's two-letter play should influence me to play less openly. Perhaps this is where I should have followed my gut instead of my head.

#note I was slightly flustered by his play. Thankfully, the best play was quite obvious for me.

>Toh_Weibin: ADENTUV 6D DEV +30 186
#note TAV simulates better in that position, however I like ANTU quite a lot. DENU should still have a slight advantage.

>Toh_Weibin: AINSTUU 11K U.U +6 192
#note Not really pleased that NAUTI(L)US wasn't opened for me, with 2 Ls played. Another option I was considering was AUNTI(E) E1, but I thought it would have been very unlikely to pick a 3x3 and be able to play it. UNSUIT 15J is another decent option that simulates best. It is a good play as it makes up for some of the deficit.
>David_Sutton: LOPRSTU O3 POULT.RS +61 396
>Toh_Weibin: AAINNST E1 INNAT. +12 204
#note Well, with most of the lines taken out, I had to open something crazy. It's probably too late at this stage, but a better play is NANA A7. INNATE is a surprising second.
>David_Sutton: IQ 14F QI +64 460
>Toh_Weibin: AAEFGSY M13 FAY +29 233
#note Not many options here, and the highest win% here is 0.06%. You can view to the end of the game if you're interested in seeing me close the deficit to 150 points.

#note tE(N)DENCE is better, but I wasn't sure if I'd confused it with TENDANCE, even though I knew TENDENCY was a word.
