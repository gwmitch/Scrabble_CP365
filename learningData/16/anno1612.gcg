>Brett_H: AAELORU 8E AUREOLA +64 64
#note Considering I need to win by 132 to win the tourney, I'm now down 196.
>Dave_T: ?AAIKST G7 A.K +13 13
#note I didn't know LATAKIAS, KITHARAS or HALAKIST
>Brett_H: BHLLMPP I6 PL.P +12 76
#note I7 POMP is best
>Dave_T: ?AEISST E5 EnT.SIAS +78 91
#note it's a wash between this and SATIATES
>Brett_H: BGHLMQV -BGHLMQV +0 76
#note Quackle likes keeping the BL
>Dave_T: CDFIIOU D2 CUIF +23 114
#note I missed the best play of D11 FUCIand 12A FICUS.  I passed on 12A CUIFS because I didn't want to drop to third with a blowout loss coupled with a big win by Scott.  A similar scenario played out at the Arden Cup a month before.
>Brett_H: FIRT F10 FRIT +32 108
#note best
>Dave_T: DEEIOOV 2A VOI.ED +32 146
#note best and it does a great job of opening the board.
>Brett_H: EEHIRRU 14D REHIRE +36 144
#note second behind 14E UH.  This also does a great job of opening the board.  Thanks Brett!
>Dave_T: DEEJMMO 15A MODEM +40 186
#note For some reason Q has this almost even with MODEM at 1E and 13I.
>Brett_H: GLOOQRU 15I LOGO +8 152
#note Only slightly behind k$ GOORAL.
>Dave_T: EIJTVYY 14L JIVY +43 229

>Brett_H: AEORW A1 A.OWER +48 230
#note best
>Dave_T: DEGHNSU 14A UH +24 282
#note better plays are in order: 13F THEGN, O12 GUYS, 3C DUH, J12 UNDO, and 6G HUP
>Brett_H: BNNRSWX C1 N.X +38 268
#note 2nd to O13 WYN.
>Dave_T: ADEGGNS 3F SNAGGED +67 349
>Brett_H: BCLNRSW K1 CL.W +9 277
#note WYN is still best
>Dave_T: AEEINOT L2 O.EA +22 371
#note O5 TINEA is cool and all, but I need another bingo.  I dismissed ODE because I ODEA was easier to play from.  DOE was probably best here.
>Brett_H: ABDNORS L11 BAN.. +32 309
#note best buy a wide margin
>Dave_T: ?BEINTZ M4 BlINTZE +87 458
#note I thought this might have won it for me...
>Brett_H: DEIIORS N2 RISED +38 347
#note but no, Brett had another phony in him.  For some reason I verified the score before I thought to hold, by then it was too late.  IRISED and ROSED both have the advantage of being actual words.
