>Dave_T: ADEGLNT 8G TANGLED +70 70
#note I'm not sure if I should be sacrificing the 2 points to keep the A away from the 2LS.
>Margaret_S: UV J6 VU. +15 15
>Dave_T: ACEEGSV H7 G.VE +8 78
#note H8 AGAVE, 9F CAGE and CAGES, and M4 CAGED all score and sim better.

#note Q prefers 5K YOB
>Margaret_S: FHRT F10 F.RTH +27 60
>Dave_T: BEEEIKS N2 BIKES +34 141
#note best.  I liked playing off the S for 10 more since it reduces the plays along the triple line and I keep two Es to use there.
>Margaret_S: NOW L4 WON +20 80
>Dave_T: AEEEFUU -AEEFUU +0 141
#note I guess I should have kept AE
>Margaret_S: DDI O1 DID +22 102
>Dave_T: ACEEGNO M1 COG +27 168
#note K6 ENLACE is a cool play here
>Margaret_S: AS 1K SA. +6 108
#note She thought I was setting up a line to the C?
>Dave_T: AAEELNW 12I ANEW +19 187
#note I missed K3 WALE
>Margaret_S: ART K3 TAR +23 131

#note This is 2nd to N9 AJEE which I chickened out of because of possible high socring replies at O12.

#note I missed E4 ELECTRIC.  I played this over RETICLE since I figured the vowels would be harder to play through.
>Margaret_S: FIST F2 FIST +21 177
>Dave_T: AIIMRUX 13C MIX. +26 341
#note Quackle prefers 13H UM or 13I RUE
>Margaret_S: HNOP 8A PHON. +33 210
>Dave_T: AEEIPRU 9A EAR +16 357
#note I passed on the top play REAP to block the lanes.  I was pretty sure she had been holding a blank since early in the game and wanted to prevent a bingo.
>Margaret_S: ?EIMOST 10B ME +27 237
>Dave_T: EIOPRUU 11K ..E +10 367
#note I prefer Q's choice of N9 OUR to block the last lane while keeping a better leave.  My play doesn't really block, it just makes things more difficult.
