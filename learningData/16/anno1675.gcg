>Jeff_Clark: GLMOO 8H GLOOM +22 22
>Brendan_Sullivan: HIMOPRW 7J WHOMP +32 32
#note Played at 9J instead of 7J so that if I hit an E . . .
>Jeff_Clark: AITW 6G WAIT +17 39
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEEEIRU 8H .....IER +41 73
#note . . . I can play this.

>Brendan_Sullivan: ABEEPSU E5 PU.A +26 99
>Jeff_Clark: DEIIRT D8 TIDIER +19 75
>Brendan_Sullivan: BDEENST C9 BET +20 119
#note 9M BE is better; it doesn't block the bingo lanes I'm trying to hit. I also couldn't completely remember if BETTA was good. I would have done that instead.
>Jeff_Clark: AILQTUY 12D .QUALITY +71 146
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEINNS M3 INDA..NES +76 195
#note Hooray! The only bingo. It took me about 4 minutes to find it, too.
>Jeff_Clark: KRZ 10L Z.RK +19 165
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEILNUV O10 .ELVIN +42 237
#note Didn't see H1 ELUVI(A) 39.
>Jeff_Clark: AORT D2 RATO +12 177
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ABDOSU 11K BA. +35 272
#note Missing 3 bingos. I should find BUSLOAD, but I didn't know BAUSOND or BAUDRONS.
>Jeff_Clark: AACENRS 3H CANAR.ES +61 238
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?DEOSUU H12 .OUD +15 287
#note I spent too much time on this move. H1 DUCE 24 is a bit better.
>Jeff_Clark: IX N14 XI +38 276
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?DEFNSU 14B FUSED +34 321
#note C3 FUSED is 9 points more, but this placement effectively kills his bingo chances.
>Jeff_Clark: COT O1 CO.T +21 297
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEEHNN 2I HEN +19 340
#note EA(C)H for 39 seems quite tempting, but if he then bingoes thru the E and I draw a bunch of consonants and he's sitting there with 3 tiles and an out in 1, I could be in trouble. I also thought about 15A NAH or HEN, but HEN seemed like a good setup holding the case A.
>Jeff_Clark: FO B9 OF +33 330
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEEGNY 1H GAY +33 373
#note I didn't have much time left to consider this, so I took the first one I saw. Turns out it's best anwyay.
>Jeff_Clark: ?EGILRV 2B aR.IVE +32 362
#note Kudos for finding this and realizing it's best.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?EENS C1 E.NES +21 394
#note I didn't spot the variety of outs in the bottom-right of the board: Sa(T)EEN, SEN(D)Er, etc.
