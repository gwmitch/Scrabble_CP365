#note  Adrian is known in Chicago for his terrible treatment and harassment of Bob Denn while he was still alive.  I am not going to tell the story, but needless to say, I hated hated hated getting my ass handed to me by this guy.  He also was playing headgames with me throughout the game by making me repeat my score 2 and 3 times and barading me for "not speaking up".  ugh.

#note  uh, I just threw up in my own mouth.  RAJ is the play for bunches of points.  I didn't see the play until I hit my clock.  Talk about feeling dejected.

#note  I have to make the board super volatile.  I figure U in the second position isn't to bad considering I have [OT]

#note I wanted to keep my OT, but this was too many points and opened another 3x3 possibility.
