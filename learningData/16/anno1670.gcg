>Brendan_Sullivan: ENNORTU G6 NO.TURNE +63 63
#note I don't think I'd studied this one, but out it came from my noggin.
>Margaret_Sutherland: CDO H13 DOC +21 33
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIKLOSY 11E SA.KILY +56 119
#note This seemed plausible to me. I knew SARK, SARKY, SARKIER, SARKIEST, so why not SARKILY*?
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIKLOSY --  -56 63
#note Nope. Perhaps if it was worth fewer points she would have let it go.
>Margaret_Sutherland: AX F9 AX +52 85
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIKLOSY F4 OKAY +22 85
#note Onward with my second choice from before. Considered YOLKED but didn't know if YOLK was a verb (it's not, YOLKED is adjectival), and just didn't think of OKAYED/KAYOED.
>Margaret_Sutherland: BIL 5C BIL. +20 105
>Brendan_Sullivan: EILNORS 11A LORINE.S +76 161
#note 7 bingos play, including REL(AT)IONS. This one is best.
>Margaret_Sutherland: AIW A8 WAI. +21 126
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEFGNN B10 F.N +27 188
#note Shucks, didn't look at the H1 TWS. FANGED for 43 there is definitely best.
>Margaret_Sutherland: AH 4D HA. +24 150
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEGINR D8 DEA.RING +78 266
#note 14H (O)RGANDIE is also 78 but too risky with the lead I have.
>Margaret_Sutherland: DEU B10 ...DUE +20 170
#note Cute.
>Brendan_Sullivan: LMNTTUW H3 MUTT +10 276
#note Just trying to clean up my rack a bit; LNW has some potential.
>Margaret_Sutherland: AMST 3C MAST +33 203
>Brendan_Sullivan: EJLNVWY -  +0 276
#note This was embarrassing. Why did SAL "look funny" to me? And funny enough to prompt my challenge finger to reach for the clock? After the game, she pointed out it's popularity as a term for salt, and that one would see it any chemistry class? Didn't I take chemistry? Shouldn't I know that? Yes, obviously, thanks for making me feel better . . . but no I've never heard of it used as a term for salt. Aren't abbreviations or popular terms supposed to save syllables to aid pronunciation? What does SAL gain you over SALT? An extra T? Sheesh.

#note Wow, great drawing Brendan. This one scores the most.
>Margaret_Sutherland: BEEST J5 BEEST +23 273
#note This one also "looked funny," and for good reason: it's phoniness! I wasn't about to lose a third challenge this game, though.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEIIPQZ C7 QI +24 472
#note Why not at 6B?
>Margaret_Sutherland: EHT I12 THE +23 296
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEGIPZ 2A ZEE +28 500
#note Best.
>Margaret_Sutherland: EILRRUV 15F VI.E +16 312
>Brendan_Sullivan: AGIP 15A P.A. +21 521
#note Also best, after her move.
>Margaret_Sutherland: LRRU 13B .U. +8 320
>Brendan_Sullivan: GI A2 .IG +15 536
#note Hooray, a perfect endgame for me. And a good result to start the tourney with, my record at the challenge station notwithstanding.
