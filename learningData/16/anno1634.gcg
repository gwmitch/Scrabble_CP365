#note How revolting! I looked and looked for a better setup, but couldn't see anything. The problem with OP is it's way too easy to block. I thought about trying for PLIMSOL E1, but that would surely be blocked as well. I didn't think I could score enough to win without a bingo unless maybe I picked the U for SuNUP 14B. Anyone for PLESIoPOD*?

#note This was weak - I saw afterward that SINE was much better, but I was almost out of time.
