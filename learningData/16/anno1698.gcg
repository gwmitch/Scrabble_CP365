#note I was surprised to find this, and rather quickly, at that. I remember KERATOTIC coming up in a past game; either my opponent or I missed it, something like that.

#note 8J PIGOUT 33. Will this spot ever get used?
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AAINNV 13F AN +13 336
#note I did not know N1 FAVONIAN 80. I should, however, have found M4 NIRVANA 68.
>dugy1001: GLOTTUU 12J OUTGUT +19 353
#note Phoney alert! Didn't look right to me, but I hesitated for a few too many seconds, thinking it would surely open a bingo for me. Then I felt it was too late to hold or challenge. Turns out there are no bingos here. Oops!

>Brendan_Sullivan: ?EINSVW M3 SNIVEl +38 403
#note Ugh, missed M6 VIEWINGS 88! I could fish again with AW or OW or VAW somewhere. I thought SNIVEL gave me a good shot at winning. As long as I don't draw drek like II or UI, I should have an out or a nice play to be made.
>dugy1001: DEIILPU 8J .UL.ED +27 401
#note Now 8J gets used! Meanwhile, I haven't drawn drek (phew!) and am threatening L7 WET 14 and out. N7 LIEU blocks that and leaves an unblockable 1H DIP 26 and out next for a 5 point win for me. PULLED threatens only L12 TIPI. I can block that with M12 GET and win by 7 after 14A OP then 11A AW.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ETW 9G T.W +16 419
#note I saw this won, despite allowing TIPI, so I took it.
