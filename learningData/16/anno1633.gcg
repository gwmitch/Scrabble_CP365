#note Exch J sims okay on its own, but maybe it's even more worthwhile after his exch 2 . . .

#note N6 HO(E)R 17 sets up the S. I think I'd play that, but both of these have merit, depending on your style.
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEEMQRT 7C CERMET +19 105
#note Ugh, spent too long on this move. I was deciding between 7C CERMET 19, 12K MEETS 24, and 13N Q(I) 11, and if not those, then mabe an exchange keeping ET or ERT. I did not even see the top-simming move, N6 CR(E)ME 25. My reasoning was that after any scoring play here, his play will put me down over half a bingo. At that point, do I want to be holding the Q or not? By saying no, I can only get 11 (or 0) points now. Or I could take the 19 and open a few more spots for bingos later on. I was almost accepting that I might need to exchange the next turn, or take Q(I), but if it meant I had more opening for scoring at that point, that's fine. CR(E)ME seems a little odd to me; it's only 6 more than CERMET and doesn't really open anything. Plus, with CERMET I'm really reaching in extra for those two blanks unseen. I'm not thrilled with any of these moves, and I think in a tournament situation, I would probably make one of the exchanges.

#note Cool, 4A SUPERTAX! I did not know that one.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADDHIOU J3 ODAH +32 245
#note AHI in the same spot is 3 more, but DDOU doesn't look appetizing.
>ftangredi: ?AISTVX L4 VAT +22 223
#note Still hanging on to that X. 3I V(O)X / 4C V(E)X for 13 seem like fruitful fishes. 14A mASTIX 63 is interesting.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DDILNRU N1 UNRIDDL. +78 323
#note Only bingo.
>ftangredi: ?BEIISX 12B I.IS +32 255
#note B(R)IS instead is a little better.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACINOPU O1 PA +26 349
#note Wow, couldn't find CO(U)P. After that, his only hope is to bingo on row 14 or row 4/5
>ftangredi: ??ABEWX 12J AXE +38 293
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEINOTU 3B CU.E +20 369
#note Well, I blocked bingos thru the E/K. F2 CONIU(M) 18 shuts down all of those lanes and leaves him with just the PARTS/PARTY hook.
>ftangredi: ??BIWYZ 14B BY +24 317
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEIMNOT 5D .EM +12 381
#note Now I'm worried that he is going to bingo thru the G. This move scores too little to be worth it though. Now, he can catch me with high-scoring blank plays. Had I seen (or even bothered to look for) 13I EMOTE 37, I would have played it and hoped for the best.
>ftangredi: ??EIWYZ 13J WYEs +43 360
>Brendan_Sullivan: EINOOTU 6F ONE +20 401
#note Dumb, but the best I could find with not much time left. I'm not threatening any outs next turn; this allows Frank to play just A13 Za, setting up his S for more. best is O4 NOO 13, threatening 13E ETUI, so he goes out with ZIgS to lose by 6.
>ftangredi: ?ISZ A13 ZaS +40 400
#note He played the S, and the best I play is BI/SI for 6. All I need is a 10+ point play to win...
>Brendan_Sullivan: IOTU O4 TO +9 410
#note Aarrghh! I know I had at least 6 seconds on my clock before this move, and that's twice as long as it should take to find 3M O(R)T 11 or B9 TO 10 or B1 TI(C), the 3 winning moves.
>ftangredi: I B14 .I +6 406
#note And so we tie. I really gave that one away down the stretch.
