#note  ugh.  I missed UNDE(R)CUT.  I saw the double U's and the E in the triple lane and just lost my mind.

#note best
>Brett_H: DEEGLLO 7K GOLD +22 149
#note GELLED is probably better because it makes it harder to bingo on the board and creates a lot of turnover, but it opens up some easy underlays on the bottom triple lane.  I probably shouldn't have played GOLD without holding as S.  I also considered just playing GO in the same spot.  With an ?ELLED pattern, it could be a decent set-up for points on the next turn. 
>Dave_T: ?EEGIIS H8 .IG +5 158
#note Dave: I spent awhile on this play and didn't get it right.  Q prefers J10 BITE, N2 SIEGED, J12 TIE, I7 IRE, 11D GIES, and N4 GIED.  I'd like to keep the S hook on GOLD open and TIE seems too risky, so I would have played BITE had I seen it.
#note Brett: I gave Dave a lot of shit for this play on the car ride back.  Holding the blank, you really should be making it easier to bingo than this, plus you cut off your highest scoring bingo lane.  Looking at the board though, tehre really aren't any star plays, but BITE seems best.
>Brett_H: AEELNOR 6N OE +9 158
#note Q doesn't like this one very much
>Dave_T: ?DEEIPS 14A SPEIrED +78 236
#note IMPEDES or SPELLED would have been safer
>Brett_H: AAELNRR 10F RA. +6 164
#note  this play flat out sucks.  I am gaining nothing here except for giving him plays on the 2x2 lane.  I figure keep it open and maybe bait him a little, but this isn't really a very successful way to do it.  there aren't a whole lot of good plays here, but AR(I)L for 10 opens up two more lans and gives a good leave.
>Dave_T: DEFIKSY A12 DE.K +33 269
#note I was all set to play DIKEY but after his last fist I had to close the TWS lane.  I'd prefer to keep the S and not play KISS or KISSY.
>Brett_H: AELNRRT 15F R +2 166
#note Brett: Q likes R(AI)N @ 13F.  I wanted to make it a little harder to score easy on the triple lane and leave bingo lines open with a good low scoring rack.
>Dave_T: FHISTWY E8 WIFTY +36 305
#note Dave: Quackle likes WIFTY, WITHY, or WHITY at 5K.  I'd prefer to close the lane he opened.
>Brett_H: ?AELNRT D3 ENTeRAL +72 238
#note Brett: best.  I hate when I have a leave like AELNRT and draw the blank to it.  With this leave, half of the unseen bag would have given me a bingo.  Why not just let me bingo and then give me the blank?  Gah!
>Dave_T: AHHIOSS C3 HO +22 327
#note Dave: I thought I should close some of the new lanes but Q prefers 13C HO, which would have worked out better for me.  E3 HAO does a better job of clsing lanes.
>Brett_H: BEJLRUV C11 JEB.L +28 266
#note  Brett: JUB(E) is far and away the best play here.  the [RUV] isn't doing much for me except for guarding against a Q draw.  I can't really be worried about that now.  I need balance and bingo opportunities.  If I draw the Q it's just insult to injury. 
>Dave_T: AAHINSS 13L AH. +24 351
#note Dave: best  Had I not blocked the lines up top SHAITANS would have played.
>Brett_H: AMRTUVZ I11 V.M +19 285
>Dave_T: AINNSSV 5D .AV +12 363
#note How the hell did I miss VAINNESS for 165?  I guess I didn't think to look for -NESS/-LESS words until the next turn.  This was the last game of a tiring but that's no excuse.
>Brett_H: ANORTUZ 6B ZO.A +34 319
#note Brett: ZONAT(E) for 48 puts me down 30 and gives me a shot at inching back into the game.  ZO(E)A scores decent and leaves the only really good bingo line open....let's see if he keeps it open...
>Dave_T: ILNNRSS 8C L..N +7 370
#note Dave: Quackle likes G1 LINNS which seems crazy, 5J LINNS closes the remaining lines he could use.
#note Brett:  Dave, you might want to take your version of Quackle in for a tune up.  My Champion player doesn't even mention G1 as an option.  The play it suggests is INNL(E)SS for 31 and then 5J LINNS.  You should really be closing that lane at this point.
>Brett_H: ENNORTU 5H NEUTRON +68 387
#note  Brett:  Told ya.
>Dave_T: INRSSUW I4 S.R +3 373
#note Dave: this is embarassing.  I missed his Q play, and had mistracked and thought I was blocking ROQUE.  Q wants me to play HERS blocking COVE.  Since he's more likely to play off the Q, I should have played UNWISE first.
#note Brett:  As I was turning over the tiles, the first one I saw was the Q.  I'm thinking okay, well there's a U still out.  d'oh!  A U-less Q rack is a nail in the coffin here.
