#note UNGIRT and TRUING wouldn't have doubled up my leave.  I'm not too high on opening the triple lane with RUTTING or TURGID but Q doesn't seem to mind.

#note Q gives an edge to 10H ENDNOTE.  I thought there were too many Ss unseen.

#note Given he just opened a line for himself, I don't like Qs choices of 2L ROVE, KORE, or N1 OVER.  I figured I couldn't block, but didn't want to setup a 3x3 and this play scored well and kept a vowel.  The sim results disagree.  If anyone's reading this I'm curious as to what they think.

#note I really liked this play and Q hates it giving B11 QADI a 26% greater win percentage.  I'm opening another Q play for myself and not giving him a new bingo line.  I guess playing through the P or hooking a an S on DORP won't be that hard, but it's a close game and I sensed he was close to bingoing.  Strangely M9 ADIPIC has the best win percentage by 10 percentage points at 51%, despite the potential Q stick.

#note 2 of the 9 tiles unseen to him would have allowed me to block the lane and they were both in the bag.  The odds are 1 in 72.  That said, he also could have bingoed out with NEMESIS at N8.
