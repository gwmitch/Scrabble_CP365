>Jason: AEHITTV 7G HAT +21 21
#note Liked it better than HIVE; considered the EITV leave seven better than ATT.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ADGLNRY C3 YARDL.NG +80 166
#note Hold.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ADGLNRY --  -80 86
#note Had no choice; game's all but over if I keep it on, esp. with my rack. "Good challenge," Ron said.
>Jason: EEIITUV C8 .UTVIE +20 41
#note UVEITI(S) scores the same and gets rid of another I. (Edit: Thanks to Jesse Day for pointing out UVEITI(S) gives Ron DAR(I)NGLY.)
>Ron_Hoekstra: ADGLNRY 14C DANGLY +26 112
#note He saw he had GRANDLY ... one of the reasons he tried YARDLONG* was that he didn't really have a great play and thought I might give him a spot for GRANDLY (or DARINGLY, given how I thought I should've played UVEITIS) if it was challenged off. To be clear, he wasn't sure it was no good.
>Jason: AEGIIOP 15H AGIO +30 71
>Ron_Hoekstra: EPRSV L11 PERVS +29 141
>Jason: ?ACEIOP 6D ECtOPIA +74 145
#note Nice fit, but APOGEIC is 77 and APNOEIC is 76 in the same spot. POAC(H)IER for 77 is also better.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ILL 11C .ILL +14 155
#note Ron had 8:17 left after this play, but as I agonized over almost every rack for the rest of the game, he only went over by less than a minute. If I'd known I was going to play the second half of this game so awfully, I'd have done it faster.
>Jason: ADEENRW M10 WADE +27 172
#note Q says WANE is slightly better, but it's close.
>Ron_Hoekstra: FORST K8 FROST +30 185
>Jason: EEENORU E4 RE.U.E +16 188
#note Hoped an ENR leave was enough to insulate myself from the vowel-heaviness of the pool, but alas.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ANNO 8K .ANON +27 212
>Jason: EIINOOZ N6 ZO. +32 220
#note I took forever on this decision; you'd have thought I could've come up with something decent. I dismissed Z plays at D1 or ZONE(R) at A4 because I figured with an IOO leave after ZINE (the best play) I was going to give Ron two cracks at tripling it. But this play's detriments are worse, as it scores less, closes bingo lanes I may need later and doesn't solve my vowel problem. I need to not dismiss plays like ZONE, but revisit them when I don't have better options. I started playing really bad here and didn't stop until the game was over. Also whiffed on ZOO at 5J for 35.
>Ron_Hoekstra: ADQ 12A QA.D +54 266
#note Insta-played, obviously.
>Jason: EIIMNOT A12 .I +11 231
#note Played a hunch that he had a U. Was wrong.
>Ron_Hoekstra: AFLM D2 FLAM. +28 294
>Jason: EIMNNOT 2D .ONT +9 240
#note Saw potential for a ????ZOON play; missed ENTOZOON here.
>Ron_Hoekstra: J 10J J. +25 319
>Jason: EEEIMNY C3 EYE +27 267
#note If I play along row 1, he plays along row 2 and the board's dead.
>Ron_Hoekstra: EX 1G EX +29 348
>Jason: DEIKMNR B1 KID +20 287
#note DREK in the same spot's better; gotta keep scoring. 
>Ron_Hoekstra: ORS N10 ORS +23 371
>Jason: AEEIMNR B5 MI +14 301
#note I told Ron his previous play cost him spread, as I was going to throw the Hail Mary and play (EX)AMINER.
>Ron_Hoekstra: B J14 B. +10 381
>Jason: AEEGNNR J5 N. +2 303
#note Must stop making spread-hemorrhaging decisions in lost games.
>Ron_Hoekstra: CEIIRTU K1 CURIE +18 399
#note Even over on time, he's not going to blunder and leave UNEAGER open.
>Jason: AEEGNRU 1K .AGER +27 330
>Ron_Hoekstra: IT M1 .IT +8 407
#note Missed the I back hook to VILL. Minus 10 for the time penalty.
>Ron_Hoekstra:  (ENU) +6 413
