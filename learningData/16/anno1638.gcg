>fuzzmoz: AACJMNO 1G MAC. +33 115
#note 1H JOHN 42.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEINTU I7 I.UNDATE +65 130
#note Neat, 1G (MACH)INATE 51. This was the only bingo, though.
>fuzzmoz: AEJNOTU H12 TUNE +22 137
#note 12H JAUNT 40.

>Brendan_Sullivan: BGIMRRT F7 G.RM +13 169
#note 5E BRIG 21 or GRIM 22 or BRIM 24 are all a little better. saving the I isn't worth sacrificing 8-11 points.
>fuzzmoz: AEEGJOS G13 JO +38 210
>Brendan_Sullivan: BFILRST L2 FL.B +9 178
#note Again, saving the lone vowel on my rack is not worth sacrificing points. 15D FLITES or FRITES 33 are fine. As a side note, no INUNDATER*; it's INUNDATOR (and that takes a Y back hook!).
>fuzzmoz: AEEGISV 10H E.VISAGE +74 284
#note Nice, the only bingo.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIRSTW O8 SW.ATIER +158 336
#note Hooray!
>fuzzmoz: DIKOWXY E10 OXY +30 314
#note 15E YOW(E)D 36 is best. There will be places to play the X next turn.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACEEEFH D11 EACH +37 373
>fuzzmoz: DIIKSWZ 2L .IZ +30 344
#note Hmm, 3C KIWI 33 sims best. I would think 14F Z(ONE)D 39 is better.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEEEFN 15F NE.D +26 399
#note 5C DEAFEN 26 is probably better. Gives me more chances for any of the unseen SS? and neutralizes that bingo lane.
>fuzzmoz: DEIKNSW 5B SWINKED +87 431
#note Ouch.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEFOOT 4A FOOT +33 432
>fuzzmoz: ALORSTU 11K TOR +14 445
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ABEELR A1 BEE. +27 459
#note Grr, M7 REp(AR)ABLE 72 is the winning move. I'd like to think that in a tourney I would hunker down and look hard for this one; I bet I wouldn't find it anyway. There are plenty of fishing moves here, playing off the E or BE, but all of them rely on me finding a 9 next turn, too. With BEEF, I'm hoping to outrun her, and possibly cash the ? somewhere for a high-scoring play.
>fuzzmoz: ADELOSU C9 AULD +23 468
#note Best. Threatens a few outs, the best being J12 OES for 25.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AELRR N2 .As +23 482
#note I didn't see OES coming. My brain also farted. Best move is J12 REs 19 blocking OES. She gets (AR)OSE for 10 and out, winning by 6.
>fuzzmoz: EOS J12 OES +25 493
#note This might be the first time I've trip-tripped and still lost!
