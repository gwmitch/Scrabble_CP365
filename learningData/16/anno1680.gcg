#note this is a BAD MOVE. i didn't see URTEXT, which is clearly better! SUQ 14M just seemed too dumb. i forgot how i justified the move at the time.. i just didn't want him to have the X spot. [-8.5]

#note finally got my i but now i just can't take that spot. REG sims terribly compared to F5 QI but screw the sim now, i don't want to just give up this spot :)
