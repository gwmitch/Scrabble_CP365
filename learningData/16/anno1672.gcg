>George_Viebranz: DEEORST E4 OERSTED +74 74
#note TEREDOS is a little safer.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEFNNX 4D F.X +26 40
#note The comebacks to F2 FAX are too easy to hit and too high-scoring.
>George_Viebranz: AACDENT H1 CATENAD. +86 160
#note A clever combination of CATENAE and TAPENADE, I guess. Didn't look right to me, but I didn't even hold. I don't know George to be much of a phonier.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEHNNT 1E pEN.HANT +63 103
#note I looked and looked and looked, believing there had to be something higher scoring. I passed up 9I ENcHANT for defense, but I also chose PENCHANT over ENCHANTS to leave the S hook open, which seems somewhat contradictory. But given the score, I needed an open board, but not too open, or else he could seal the victory early on with a big bingo or 3x3. Also, NANOTECH would have been fun.

#note I was eyeing the ATWEEN hook, but wanted to play the Q.
>George_Viebranz: IIIII -IIIII +0 205

#note Glad I drew another T.

>Brendan_Sullivan: BELMNOU 9I UMBONEL +66 252
#note This was silly. I remembered having trouble learning the word in this rack, continually missing it during Zyzzyva quizzes. I was so sure that this was the right one, and that NELUMBO was the plausible-sounding phony my mind always came up with, that I was sitting there hoping for a challenge! I even mentioned right after the game that I used to think it was NELUMBO before unlearning that; but I had it all backwards! Luckily, Dan Stock had been roaming the room and pointed out the phoniness to me a minute later, and I was able to tell George the true story before he played it in another game and could blame me for the misinformation. BTW, NELUMBO plays at M6 for 66, leaving a juicy S hook on the DWS.
>George_Viebranz: ADIV O7 VA.ID +27 250
>Brendan_Sullivan: ABEGLRU M7 BU.GLER +26 278
#note I didn't really look hard at the 4L HI front hooks. GRUB is obviously best.
>George_Viebranz: AEGIRSS 13F GRASSIE. +61 311
#note The only bingo. K5 ZARIBAS/ZAREBAS is cool.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEGIMY H12 G.MY +36 314
#note Again, missing the 4L GHI hook.
>George_Viebranz: AAIII -AAIII +0 311
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEEIPT 4L PE +24 338
#note PIE is a bit better, with IIII still out there.
>George_Viebranz: AIV 6B VAI. +15 326
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AEIIST O7 .....ATES +42 380
#note I saw VANITIES, but not the other bingos. Still, Looking at the pool, I feared a really easy 40+ point overlap response on the TWS and if I drew drek at the same time, I could be done for. I didn't really have time to consider the possibilities, I just felt that a bingo from the V could get me in trouble, but keeping the blank meant I could get myself out of trouble, if needed. However, a sim doesn't agree with that; I actually give up a win about 5% of the time by not taking CAVITIES or VITALISE.
>George_Viebranz: CFIO C10 COIF +28 354
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?IIIRUY 10J Ye +30 410
#note I only had a minute left for this play. I didn't think this could be best, but it meant I would still be ahead even after a 35ish point K play from him. Turns out Ya is the best, because it doesn't allow him to set up (Be)RL(I)N.
>George_Viebranz: KLNORW B11 KNOW +37 391
#note 12L WEKA 32 leads to a 21 point loss for him after B12 LORN 16.
>Brendan_Sullivan: IIIRU 4D ...I.R +19 429
#note I only found this during the 5 minutes he spent on the previous move. My first thoughts were R(E)I or PE(RI), but I'm glad I found this.
>George_Viebranz: LR C5 L.R +4 395
#note I8 (NU)RL is 5 better. Overall, a good and exciting game, save for the two phony bingos.
>George_Viebranz:  (IIU) +6 401
