>Ross_Brown: AEEGIRT -  0 0
#note This is not a pass; this is how I record all games where I go second.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AAFGILN 8D FANGA +26 26
>Ross_Brown: AEEGIRT F3 GRATI.EE +63 63
#note Find the better bingo!
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AFILRUU 3D FU.U +9 35
#note Best, despite E5 FIL(A)R +32.
>Ross_Brown: ADEEIKN H1 KNEAD +42 105
#note H1 EKED +42 is marginally better.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AILLLRT D3 .ILL +14 49
#note Quackle prefers 7D IL(I)AL +19.
>Ross_Brown: ADDEIUV 11B DIVED +31 136
#note VID and VIED both give front hooks, so I opt to double down on the odd-looking words and hope that Jeremy challenges.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AALOORT -  0 49
#note Challenge lost.
>Ross_Brown: AEHNOUZ B11 .OZE +28 164
#note This sets up (Z)A in the likely event that Jeremy plays on the bottom row…
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AALOORT 15A ORAL +30 79
>Ross_Brown: AHJNOSU C13 AH. +39 203
#note …yeah, like that.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AINOQTT H7 Q.T +12 91
>Ross_Brown: GJNOSUW D11 .UG +27 230
#note Best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AEIINOT I6 OI +15 106
#note Quackle strongly prefers hiding these two away (or I9 OI +6) for less points, possibly because Jeremy doesn't have the S to cash in the hook he's opening.
>Ross_Brown: AEJNOSW J4 JOW +34 264
#note For another 14 points, I should have spent the S also.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AEEINPT 4J .APE +26 132
>Ross_Brown: AELNOSV K3 V.NE +24 288
#note 2H (N)OVENAS +36 is a better play, but I sense a double-double coming…
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?CEIMNT 1D sTIC.MEN +65 197
#note …and I'm right about that (K4 (A)MNEsTIC +108).
#note There are a couple of better bingos on the M column.
>Ross_Brown: ABEILOS I9 OBELIAS +64 352
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AIOUWY 3M YOU +22 219
#note Best.
>Ross_Brown: DOPRRSY O1 RO.PY +39 391
#note Quackle prefers this over N2 S(O)RRY +46.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AEIIIM 5C I.I. +8 227
#note This opens for M(ILIA) but sacrifices a lot of points relative to other plays that spend the M.
>Ross_Brown: DENORSX 14I .XONES +58 449
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AEHIMR L7 cHAIRME. +82 309
#note There are three bingos that use that M hook, but the score is similar.
>Ross_Brown: CDRSSTT 13K T.D +16 465
#note M1 DR(YE)ST +10 is better, forcing Jeremy to choose between blocking C(A)ST/C(I)ST or playing 13K W(E)BER +35.
#note I opt to block the big play instead.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: BENRTW 9K T.RN +5 314
>Ross_Brown: CRSST E10 R.TS +22 487
#note Best.
