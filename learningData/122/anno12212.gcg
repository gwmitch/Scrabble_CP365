#note After I got done losing this one I wondered whether I had made a big mistake here. The actual result was a horrendous rack - somewhat likely from the way the unseen tiles are distributed.  If I had thought about it carefully, played BEST instead of BEERIEST, and then submitted an entry, maybe I would have won a prize for Best Strategic Play!  It turns out it probably wouldn't have worked because BEERIEST sims better - it's 22 points more; that must be the main reason. (61 vs 39).  I would have hated if I'd taken the wrong choice with these two particular words.  In this case BEERIEST is better than BEST.
