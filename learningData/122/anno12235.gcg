>Dave_Johnson: IO 9F OI +15 15
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEINRSY 10E AY +26 48
>Dave_Johnson: EH 11D EH +20 35
#note Beside Dave and I, Carl Johnson and Ruth Hamilton were playing. Ruth looks over and says: "Looks like a beginner's game..." Carl then adds: "Looks like you brought your cheat sheets..." For whoever is viewing this, stay tuned, for the 'staircase syndrome' doesn't last TOO long.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EINNRRS D10 R.NIN +16 64
#note Quackle likes RIN 12D, a play I didn't find. To be honest, I think I spaced out on AHI. R(E)NIN is more than adequate.
>Dave_Johnson: ATU C13 TAU +12 47
#note C12 UTA is two points more yet lacks some defensive merit.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EERRSTX 14B R.. +6 70
#note Quackle acknowledges this play with credibility, but likes EXERT C6 ahead of all choices. I figured dumping the R could lead to some promising plays, especially if he should bingo and open up the board.
>Dave_Johnson: IO 7H OI +5 52
#note In order for me to have winning chances against Dave, I need him to get slowed down with rough draws. Next turn he'll place an I at J6 to steepen the staircase!
>Gunther_Jacobi: EERSTTX C6 EXERT +28 98
#note Just C7 TEXT is better, yet I liked my play, thinking if Dave hits big from A8, I should/might be able to hit big vertically to B6, or vice-versa.
>Dave_Johnson: EEIRSTV 6I SIEVERT +66 118
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEELPST N5 P.ELECTS +68 166
#note The only bingo. I might add that this was the first time in two years that Dave had unsuccessfully challenged a play of mine. PREELECTS/PRAELECTS may have done some distorting.
>Dave_Johnson: ADEILV -  +0 118
#note This is a huge shift of initiative, especially with the board newly transformed.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABDGIOO B1 GOBOID +35 201
#note I seriously thought this was good, as did Dave. If Quackle thought it was valid, GOBOID would've been it's first choice too. ADOBO A11 is the top REAL word.
>Dave_Johnson: ADEILV 1B .LAIVED +39 157
#note Quackle likes VALID D4 for forty, but (G)LAIVED scores well and combines defence.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEFNRT 8A FR.NA +27 228
#note LEAF C1 is reccommended. I thought long on this turn, thinking I could be missing a bingo, or strong power plays to/from both middle TLS's. My choice is Q's bottom pick.
>Dave_Johnson: IRZ 4A Z.RI +46 203
#note Nearly equalizing.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEGJTTY 12H GYTTJA. +40 268
#note I just love how the game started with the staircase horror, but 's turned into this!
>Dave_Johnson: HMO 8L HO.M +39 242
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??ADEEN 2H ENDgAmE +73 341
#note 5E kNEEpAD 2x2 is superior and sick. I didn't even consider the 5E option. Also there are 9 bingos from 3B that are much stronger than my choice. BEACONED, BEADSMEN, and a collection of Shakespearean type words: BEMOANED, BEMEANED, BEMADDEN etc. I looked at that spot, but the two blanks blanked me out.
>Dave_Johnson: BKNO 1L BONK +49 291
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAFPSSU L10 PU.A +13 354
#note Initially, Quackle jumps all over F(E)U 9M, while PU(J)A isn't even recognized. Yet after 1000 iterations, my choice becomes Quackle's fourth. At first, I was just going to play SAU E4, but PU(J)A looked more promising.
>Dave_Johnson: LOW H12 .LOW +24 315
#note Or LOW E4? GLOW I think is much better for it blocks bingos on row 14.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ACDFGSS A12 FAGS +41 395
>Dave_Johnson: NU D6 NU. +16 331
>Gunther_Jacobi: CDEILMS 14J MESIC +44 439
#note Or MISLED, which I didn't see.
>Dave_Johnson: AEOUW 5J AW +22 353
#note (O)WE M8 26.
