>Thomas_Lackaff: EILNRSS C4 SLIN.ERS +61 75
#note Quackle likes B7 R(A)INLESS 70, or next, RES(I)LINS F5/F3.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ENOOWWZ D3 ZOON +34 129
#note Of course! W(I)NZE F7! I saw this at B6 but spaced it where it should've been played. ZOON isn't bad.
>Thomas_Lackaff: AVV F7 V.VA +12 87
#note The deadly double-V combo.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?EILOWW 6B W..O +15 144
#note WO E4 is exactly what I wanted to accomplish, but for whatever reason, missed completely.
>Thomas_Lackaff: DFOR E10 FORD +21 108
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?DEGILW 12D W.IgGLED +78 222
#note (S)WInGLED A8 92 is the play. I saw it, but didn't think it was valid.
>Thomas_Lackaff: QUY J10 QU.Y +36 144
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEFHIU H12 .UID +18 240
#note FI(Q)UE 10H.

>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEFHOP B11 EPHA +20 260
#note 5B A(LO)HA 31! EPHA is terrible and unlisted.

#note Surprisingly, this is Quackle's first choice.
>Thomas_Lackaff: U 7H .U +5 227
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEILRTT K6 RECTI +18 341
#note Hadn't a clue here. I was sick and tired of fishing and just decided make a play. (D)ELTIC 2E would've been ideal.
>Thomas_Lackaff: AEHINRS 8K .HINE +42 269
#note Quackle likes this idea, passing up the bingo, scoring well, leaving ARS and hoping to bingo next turn, but doesn't like it as much as bingoing straight away with HERNIAS J1.
>Gunther_Jacobi: IILORTU J3 LIROT +17 358
#note LOI(D) 15E is correct, blocking row 15.
>Thomas_Lackaff: ?AEEPRS O2 RAPESE.d +62 331
#note The most intriguing point in the game! (D)EPRAvES 15H 85 equalizes the game undoubtedly, yet Tom's logic was this: RAPESEED will come close in score, and if he should be fortunate enough the G, GRAPESEED could win. The only problem is that GRAPESEED isn't an acceptable word. Both Tom and I thought it should be good. I blocked, leaving one tile in the bag, just in case it was valid.
>Gunther_Jacobi: BEEINTU N1 BE +12 370
#note All top plays get rid of BE, yet they do so in more superior places, since GRAPESEED isn't a real threat.
