>Mack: EFINOPT 8G FOP +16 16
#note 8D FEINT briefly crossed my mind, but I thought EINT was at least 8 points better than OP. Quackle agrees, with FOP valued about 5 points higher than FEINT.

>Will: ENORUXY 12K OXY +28 43
>Mack: CMNRTTV M11 M.C +20 100
#note As much as NRTTV is an ugly leave, I thought 20 points was worth it. At first Quackle values exchanging keeping CR at two points better than MYC, but after a 1000 iteration sim MYC is neck and neck on top with exchanging. The best exchanges keep CR, RT, and CRT, according to the 1000 iteration sim.

>Mack: NORTTVV -TVV +0 100
>Will: AEEEEOU -AEEEEOU +0 120
>Mack: DGNNORT 14I DONG +11 111
#note This play barely edges out E10 NITID on the sim, probably due to its volatility. NITID makes it very hard for Will to score at all unless he has a bingo, whereas this opens row 15 in two spots.
>Will: AABEEIO 15L OBIA +25 145
>Mack: LNRSTTZ E10 Z.T. +13 124
#note I considered LUTZ C12, but even though it preserves a much better leave, placing the Z in the middle of the triple lane is very dangerous. Quackle actually prefers exchanging down to RST, since LNRST is too prone to racks having 1, or even worse, 0 vowels.
>Will: AADEEIW F11 .A.A +8 153
>Mack: ELNRRST C12 N.RL +4 128
#note I was debating between this, exchange LR, and NERTZ 10A.
I decided against NERTZ since it was way too volatile, and wanted to partially close row 15 and thus chose NURL over exchanging.

#note I was not 100% sure whether SLIPE was good (it is), but I didn't expect him to try a phony with several other bingo options available.

>Mack: ADJRSTW 3C J.W +26 273
#note Quackle prefers JAWED in the same spot, but I wanted to keep a more bingo prone leave as well as the last A.
