#note The most amazing thing about this game is what happens with the Q.  If I focus a lot on rack balance, bingos, and sometimes a little bit on hooks, I can easily leave out Q strategy from my bag of tricks.  Carl seems to be right on top of it.  I get the Q twice this game and in between there's a spot for a monster Q play - cruelly, it disappears too soon for me to use it.  Did Carl do this to me out on purpose out of SPITE? Or did he just want to win the scrabble game? (joke!)

#note Interesting position and my choice is somewhat worse than the best (UNHIRED is better than HIRUDIN because of the place it's in - both get better tiles into my rack more quickly) but not much worse than HI (F6 or 3I) or HUNH 4D

#note A note on my scoresheet says I should have exchanged here. 16 is not many points. However I did manage to get a bingo the turn after next, which is 31 points, so maybe it wasn't so wrong.

#note I had an awful time trying to figure out what my scoresheet meant for this game.  This looked like maybe 'uneasing' (not TWL) or UNCASING.  There was a U missing in the end so I thought it meant there was another blank in the word.  Eventually I got around to reading it more closely. The letters were crossed out due to an interruption while I was tracking.

#note No Q play so I exchanged.  There was a decent setup NEVI at M4 or M5. Quackle Championship Player suggests a better exchange is AIPQV which makes sense to me - I kept AEIPN for some reason but it didn't work too well.
