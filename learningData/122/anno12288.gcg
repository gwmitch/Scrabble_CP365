>Amit_C.: EHJU 8G JEHU +28 28
>Daniel_C.: AFIRSSY K4 FRAYS +37 37
#note In retrospect, FAYS is obviously better: I like keeping the R in the leave, and it moves the vowel away from the TLS.
>Amit_C.: OPR J6 PO.R +27 55
>Daniel_C.: ?GINORS H1 ORGaNIS. +74 111
>Amit_C.: IQ J3 QI +16 71
>Daniel_C.: BCDENOY 9F CODE. +36 147
#note One of the things I learned this tournament - if you have clunky tiles, there's no reason to keep the board open.  I can let my opponent do that for me, and in the meantime slow down the game tempo to give me more time to draw into something better.
>Amit_C.: AIIL F9 .ILIA +9 80
>Daniel_C.: BEINRUY 2F BU.Y +15 162
#note Ok, this was just me being lazy - of course I know REBUYING, but I just didn't take the time to see it.
>Amit_C.: AIINTX 3B TAXIIN. +39 119
>Daniel_C.: EIMNRTT C2 M.RTINET +62 224
#note I didn't know INTERMIT.
Upon second analysis, I do like the lower-board placement of MARTINET a little better, since it closes two of the bingo lanes in CILIA.  I think I may have been worried about the S-hook.
>Amit_C.: DEGHLPT 12D PL.GHTED +88 207
>Daniel_C.: CGLOOSS -  +0 224
#note I challenged PLIGHTED.  It still doesn't look good to me.

#note Quackle likes AFT and VENAL better.  Amit had the blank at this point, and neither of those plays could have stopped him from bingoing the next turn.
If I had considered Amit's bingos as an imminent possibility, I might have played AFT instead, since it turned over fewer tiles and made the game marginally longer.
>Amit_C.: ?AEMNOW 15G A.rWOMEN +65 432
#note And AIRWOMEN wasn't even his best play!  WOMANED plays in two places on this board, each for more than 100.  Not that he needed the extra points - any bingo was enough to win this.
>Daniel_C.: BEEFINU 4C .IF +35 408
#note There are so many places for him to put the V, so I can't even claim moral victory by sticking him with it.
