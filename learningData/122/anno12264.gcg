>Christian_O.B: ACERSTV N8 .VERACTS +80 211
#note N8 OVERCAST for same position and points slightly better than OVERACTS. Leaving S in that spot is much much more dangerous than T. I'm not so sure about OVERCAST.

>Julius_Wilson: AAJNW 13B AJWAN +34 356
>Christian_O.B: GGNNSTU J11 G.NG +10 343
#note I11 GONG for 7 points better than J11 GING for 10 points. Quackle know that GING also take -E hook (GINGE), I DON'T KNOW. With 4 E still unplayed, Julius manybe got 2 or more E to use that spot too
>Julius_Wilson: CEEILNU 1A CLU. +24 380
#note If Julius know GINGE and figured 15D LEUCINE for 87 points he will win for sure. Luckily for me....
>Christian_O.B: ENORSTU 6A TONSURE +69 412
#note Playing TOO FAST HERE. i don't 100% sure GING can be hooked S (GINGS), the only one I'm sure can be hooked S was only BRENT, and since I can play TONSURE that fit in it, I just rush my last move. Best move here don't take GINGS, just another common word A1 COUNTERS for 83 points
>Christian_O.B:  (EEEINRW) +20 432
#note Start to think I will gonna lose here. Julius tile was clearly more powerful than me.. at least for now
