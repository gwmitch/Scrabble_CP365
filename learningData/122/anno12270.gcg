#note Quackle prefers 6H (L)EHUA +16 to clear vowels.
>Ross_Brown: ABCDGJQ F8 CAB +33 109
#note I meant to play F8 GAB +31, but pulled the wrong tile.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EEEIMOU -EEIOU 0 29
#note Best.
>Ross_Brown: ADGIJQU 5E QUA. +26 135
#note Blocking the line I inadvertently opened.
#note I prefer this over 5E QAD(I) because of the -IX possibility it would open.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EELMSTW I7 WE +28 57
>Ross_Brown: DEGHIIJ J4 HIDE +22 157
#note Best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AELMSTX E9 MAX +37 94
#note F4 L(U)X +26 is marginally better for leave reasons.
>Ross_Brown: AGGIIJU 12D JIG +35 192
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EILOSTZ K3 ZIT +33 127
#note Best.
#note No place for ZLOTIES.
>Ross_Brown: AGINRTU L2 GAT +31 223
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EEELNOS D12 .EE +10 137
#note Quackle prefers things like 13A LENOS +33.
>Ross_Brown: EINOPRU 15D PURIN +46 269
#note Things are looking well in hand at this point.

>Ross_Brown: ABDEKOO K8 KABOOD.E +80 349
>Ross_Brown: ABDEKOO --  -80 269
#note Whaaaaat, no KABOODLE?  No, it's CABOODLE.  Guess which one has 47× more Google hits?
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EFFIORS M8 FOREFI.S +80 287
#note Phony, but I like it.
#note Best good play is 6J (D)IEOFF +34.
>Ross_Brown: ABDEKOO L9 BODE +33 302
#note Best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AADOUS M1 DOS +35 322
#note Jeremy misses N4 AOUdADS +77.
>Ross_Brown: AKMNNOY K8 MAKO +40 342
#note Oops!  K9 AMOK +48
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AAISUV E4 A.UA +13 335
#note Jeremy misses 8K (M)A(F)IA +42, which I had on my sheet to watch for.
>Ross_Brown: LLNNORY 8M .LY +27 369
#note Normally, I would stretch out with D1 ONLY +26, but there are two blanks and an S unseen.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?CISVVY 13A VIC.S +34 369
>Ross_Brown: LNNORRR 4B LOR.N +12 381
#note Quackle actually recommends exchanging all seven.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?EIOVWY B1 VOl.EY +38 407
#note Jeremy says he figured I didn't have the blank, but if I did, there are nine possible triple-triples that B10 YOW(I)E +38 would block.
#note Even so, since a simple bingo would win it for me, closing the L and O lines is possibly more certain to win.
#note A 50-iteration deep simulation of all possible moves shows 15J YOW(S) +30 with the best valuation (29.0) and best Bogowin (68.0) - essentially conceding the possibility of a bingo but betting that scoring 30 points and preserving the blank will win most of the time.  The aforementioned B10 YOW(I)E +38 is second best.
>Ross_Brown: EINNRRU A11 RI.EN +27 408
#note Best.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?EGITTW 1B .ETTInG +33 440
#note Find the 54-point play!  Jeremy's running out of time at this point.
