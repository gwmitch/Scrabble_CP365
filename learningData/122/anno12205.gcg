#note A couple of different ways to go here.  This is the highest scoring play, and is one of championship player's highest ranked plays.  The other alternatives it likes are the fishing plays BE at 7C or 9C and BEG F6.  They all score very close to each other.  At this score, I'd prefer not to start falling behind right away and relying on a bingo draw.  But I'm curious if other expert players would feel differently.

#note ELIXIR looks better.  I probably just missed it, but I don't remember for sure.  However, there was some method to my madness.  I preferred this to a play like NIX for a few reasons: I didn't want to start blocking up the board, and I liked setting up the I underlap for the X to the triple.

>Dave_Koenig: DHIOPRR C12 DROP +31 109
#note I chose this rather than DRIP because I wanted to save the I for underlapping the X.  But considering the number of I's and O's unseen, maybe DRIP was better.

#note Jeremy overscored this by 2 and neither of us caught it.
>Dave_Koenig: ?HIIJRR A12 Je.I +57 166
#note Burning the blank here is pretty much obligatory, but JIHADI looks like a better way to do this.

#note Some might like to play THIR A6 here, inferring that the opponent was setting up his R for the A column, but I strongly prefer my play.  I'm holding one of the last two R's for the A column, and the bag is vowel heavy.  HRT is a synergistic leave that gives my rack scoring punch.  It might be that he hits the A column, but his best play might be elsewhere.  Also, there's no guarantee he was holding an R.  His play might have just been for rack balancing.  1000 iterations of a 2 ply sim favors my play by 0.8.  Oddly, it does give a slightly higher winning percentage to his play, though I think winning percentages are pretty meaningless this early in the game with the score as close as it is.

#note Sheesh, LENTOIDS is a bad miss.  I even wrote down the alphagram on my scoresheet and failed to spot it.  This is the second best play.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EE C3 EE +16 273
>Dave_Koenig: AMNOSUV K2 MUON +26 344
#note Especially given what the EE play implies about the strength of his rack, this blocking play taking out the S and several other letters was definitely called for.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EE 10I E.E +13 286
#note Jeremy looked frustrated and muttered something about playing off two E's and drawing two more E's.

#note I had many other higher scoring plays, but this was an intentional decision, right or wrong.  Given Jeremy's last several turns of fishing off vowels, it was easy to put him close to a bingo rack, and in particular to infer that he was not holding the W or Y prior to his last turn.  Also, despite his zeal in playing off vowels, there weren't that many left, and in particular only one E.  Though he probably had that E, I didn't think it was likely he was dealing with a vowel heavy rack at this point.  On this board the E on row 13 was one of his likeliest bingo lanes, but I was also hoping to turn over enough tiles to draw the W and or the Y to set up the 14J-N scoring spot.  Also, the Q can give me big trouble here, so this gives me a good scoring spot for QIS.  Notice that VAS D2 would not only fail to close bingo lines, it would open more of them because of the A and U front hooks.

#note Scoring enough and leaving one in the bag that even a bingo response is unlikely to beat me.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ?AEGINT D8 ..G +7 299
#note Jeremy was down to little time left, but he correctly surmised that bingoing immediately was a sure loss.  This move ends up setting a very clever trap.
>Dave_Koenig: ACINOQS O5 ACO.NS +8 403
#note My obvious Q dump of QIS D1 walks straight into EQUATION as an out bingo.  Fortunately for me I would still hang on for a 12 point victory.  But I had enough time to sniff out this possibility.  My play blocks not only the O column bingos, but also AERATION N8, while leaving two spots to dump QI.  Not bad, but RACON O8 was even better, because of the two spots for QIS.
