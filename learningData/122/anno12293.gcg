#note A few options I considered here. This, exchange RU, exchange RTU (not RUT, it's not good enough for bingoing I think), and TAUTER. The problem with this is the non bingo draws, which I realized after the game. RATTER hits a decent amount of bingos, but drawing something like the H or G leaves you wondering why you didn't do something else last turn. AERT is a much more balancd leave, though exchanging still looks strong enough to give the nod over TAUTER.

#note While PEYOTL often gives me comeback trouble, it's just so much stronger than anything else in any other play, there is no reason not to play it. Meanwhile, I need to get into my head just how crappy EE really is.

#note Missed VOCAB. I think that even if I had seen it, I wouldn't have played it. Not to say that it is the wrong play, because I'm pretty sure it's right. This basically just points to me being risk-averse to decent sized 25-40 point scoring spots, which isn't a great idea. The remedy for this kind of thinking is to think "how much would he score on average otherwise?" So certainly against a strong player, VOCAB is right. Against Mark, it's harder to say, as he can obviously miss stuff quite easily, and easy places aren't great. The B just isn't that much of a threat though, especially when compared to the weakness of BV!

#note Mark held until his time was nearly up. I remembered ABACKS from the wordbook, but it turns out I was thinking of something else. It should be noted that I wasn't positive of it, but it does look like a 100% win if it is good. I should at least look for a win with a word I'm sure of. Unfortunately I don't think there is another play that wins with the E and the I in the bag, so this is probably right still.
>Mark_Milan: EEELNOR 2I .EN.LE +20 407
#note So I start Mark's clock before taking my tiles off the board (after showing him the I, which I drew as courtesy), which is a rules breach. Mark tells me I shouldn't do that. He's right, so I offer him more time if he needs it, but he says it doesn't matter.

>Mark_Milan: EIOR D6 .ORE +7 414
#note Flustered from this (at least this is how Mark told the story to Conrad), Mark goes overtime. Furthermore, he doesn't draw the last tile in the bag, which I don't notice! 
>Noah: ADGNO B6 .ANDOG +22 413
#note And I go on to win...by one. A terribly flukey ending. I don't want to play a game like this ever again.
