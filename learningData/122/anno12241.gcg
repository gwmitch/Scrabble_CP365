>Christian_O.B: BDEEHIL C3 HELED +44 155
>Christian_O.B: BFHIOST (challenge) +5 160

>Christian_O.B: AAEIMMR G2 AMA +21 286
#note G2 AMI not AMA......
>Albert_Martono: AGIN 1G GAIN +22 262
#note Maybe JINKER was good strategy too if Albert know JINKERING for 60 points extender and he confidence he will get -ING. But.......
>Christian_O.B: DEIIMRT 9L MERI +21 307
#note Took almost 5 minutes to decide L9 MERI. First I have to make sure whether this tile contain bingo or not. The moment I believe I don't have bingo, column N and O offer very nice floater E and S to bingo, AND NO EASY PLACE FOR OTHER BINGO, if Albert bingo in there, so my play was block all bingo line, score at minimum 20 points to confortable lead and play defensive till endgame. At least it was what I'm thinking that he can't bingo..... Quackle suggest 13B DI for 19. I tend to agree since it set another easy bingo line and leave MERIT. The problem was, I don't sure about FAYNED
>Albert_Martono: EIRSTUV 13B STUIVER +84 346
#note Only 1 bingo available.... In unlikely place to bingo...
>Christian_O.B: DFIISTW L11 SWIFT +32 339
#note Quackle agree it was the best I can do with 30% winning chance. I was just hope the X and Y still in bag, and he cannot play long word. My wish granted partially
>Albert_Martono: AEGINNR 15I GRA.INE +24 370
#note In fact, Albert has a bingo move N1 ENGRAINER for 74. Another shocking FACT quackle generate E2 IN for 8 points leave REGINA for 2nd best move. Huh??? Playing long word to finish the game faster much better choice in this condition....
>Christian_O.B: DGIPUXY 13K P.XY +32 371
#note 5A XYLOID for 37 best. Don't know it. 13K PIXY is 2nd best. Overscore by 4 too.... JEEZ...
>Albert_Martono: DNO 2L .OND +14 384
