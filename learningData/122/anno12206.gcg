#note MISLIVE, to live a life wrongly.  Here I go continuing with my mission to enter all my games from the National Scrabble Championship against all obstacles, neglecting other aspects of my being: job coach, wonderful email from my brother about a gorgeous sunny day etc.  Not to be confused with MS Live brand.

#note Then I still hadn't checked whether it takes an S, and I worried about it now (it doesn't - DATA - the lexicon isn't as haywire as I thought)

#note The problem here is that I tried to remember the prefix for DATA.  The only front extension is VIEWDATA.  I got the W right.  I got the rest wrong.  Purinth stared at it and wanted to challenge it but eventually he shrugged and went on with the game.  I apologize, my friend from Thailand. (Actually, I do not know you.)

#note I made this up on ISC once.  I really should apologize, I feel like it is rude to do! It makes some 8 letter words: C, G, F  BECLAMOR, BEGLAMOR, FORMABLE. I think 'rowdata' might be something I tried on ISC once too (or at club.  I could have lost the challenge there.  Sometimes I get tired of thinking, due to the long hard day.)

#note Purinth correctly determined that it was perfectly safe to open the LIS/SQUID play since my time was low and I was clearly fixated on the open E there
