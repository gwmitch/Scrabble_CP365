#note The main reason why I posted this game. I had no idea whta to do here. This is tied with ENTOIL to be the highest scoring play. I knew this would give her a monster Z or X play, but I figured if I could draw one of Z/X, I would be OK. The duck hates this play, it is way down there. Duck prefers entoil, which gives me 41.62 percent win chances. Ten other plays are better than this, and I do regret playing this, (well not fully because I won)

#note The duck thinks this wins by one with best play

#note This is speedy's idea of best play. It's not, as it loses, and playing del to the triple wins.

#note The duck now thinks she can win by 2 by playing vie, this loses by 6 with best play

#note I threw this down in a hurried rage and gave myself 13 seconds to make my last move. I saw nodal while she was making her last play. She missed nodal, but it didn't matter because she couldn't block it.
