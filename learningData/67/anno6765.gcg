>Cesar: AEELOOX -  +0 0
#note i've challenged off FATTIE* a couple of times and i just got confused. -35
>Andy: ADIOU 7I AUDIO +13 91
>Cesar: AEELOOX F8 .AXOL +28 28
#note i dunno, i like TAXOL better than LATEX, i would have rather kept two Es instead of two Os, and it's more aggressive, i thought it was worth the two points, but quackle likes LATEX by 3. apparently it gives up too much. 7B OXO sims best. -6
>Andy: DELZ E7 L.ZED +56 147
>Cesar: EEMMNOS 6J MOM +31 59
#note after he did that i just slapped down MOM instead of MEM, but they are pretty similar.

>Cesar: DEENNOS O6 DO.ENNES +63 154
#note i was gonna try NONGLAZED if he blocked, it's good!

#note !

>Andy: ?ABCINU H12 .UCA +27 229
>Cesar: IOQRTVV 11K QI +46 280
#note time for some tactical decisions. do i take the points and keep the crap and leave the board open for his blank, or do i do VICTOR and hope to outscore him? AGA is still open too. Quackle strongly prefers QI even with inferring the BIN?
>Andy: ?BEILNU 15D rUIN.BLE +59 288
>Cesar: COORTVV 10D V..T +14 294
#note this was the hardest decision of the game for me. the way i saw it, i could hope to outplay him if i do VEXT, but VORTEX puts it all up in the air, if he has something like HIVED i'm going to fall too far behind. can someone help me with the reasoning for this move? VORTEX sims way better. D4 OVA is mildly interesting. -6
>Andy: EORTW N2 WROTE +25 313
>Cesar: COORSVW 4L VR.W +28 322
#note 13B VROWS is better. i was so happy i could get rid of the V and W and keep my S that i didn't think about it too much. -6.5
>Andy: BIKR 14K BIRK +24 337
>Cesar: ACEHOOS M1 HOA. +23 345
#note maybe OAR? i don't know.
>Andy: JOT D3 JOT. +22 359
>Cesar: ACDEOSU 13B DUCES +29 374
#note another serious mistake. DUOS/OUDS/UDOS not only keep a better leave, but give far less back to opp. the unseen pool is actually rather good. -13
>Andy: EGLNT 1H LENGT. +33 392
>Cesar: AIINORS 6D ...IN +6 380
#note oh, and i didn't think of EDUCES either. god i suck.
