#note Forgot about the G hook for RAVELING. CRAG 2E or F2 wins the sim. -10

#note Lots of promising possibilities here.

>Carl: DEPRSST 4G P.STED +40 179
#note Too many options here. I'm glad I saw beyond CATCH(ERS), which I passed up last turn. My choice sims best.
>Ruth: AW 5J AW +37 237
>Carl: AOORSUY C2 YO +20 199
#note It's close between this and 6N OY. The odds of my hitting the snapback are good, but Ruth could easily hit something there herself.

#note And it gets better. I'm down but not out.
>Carl: BEIORUZ O1 .....IER +42 313
#note Quackle says ZIG 10F maximizes my winning chances from .36% to .70%. I like my play just fine. I've got outs.
>Ruth: EEIX O11 EXI.E +60 468
>Ruth: EEIX --  -60 408
#note Opportunity knocks!
>Carl: BOOPTUZ N5 UP +25 338
#note Things are starting to look, well, up. I have to take out the hotspot, but I decided to keep both Os for OOZE 14A.
>Ruth: EEIX 13I XI +36 444
>Carl: BEEOOTZ 14A OOZE +49 387
#note Best! Even ZEST O12 isn't worth burning the T for the A15 hotspot. I don't like partially constricting column A, but this game is turning radder with every play.

>Carl: BEHINTU H1 UN........ +42 429
#note Have to admit, it's getting better. A little better all the time.
