>Tunnicliffe: ABEGKPR D1 KR.B. +32 362
#note There are two ways to go about trying to win this game. I can take 7A PAGE and force Mark to find and block my out play of KRUBI. Or I can play KRUBI now and force Mark to find a way to block PAGE and GRAPE while simultaneously setting up an unblockable out for himself. I picked wrong. Mark says he would not have found KRUBI had I played PAGE first. Maybe he would have though. Because he had 10+ minutes for the endgame.
>Milan: ADEIOTV D8 O.TE. +11 357
#note Great job my Mark. He finds one of the two ways to win.
>Tunnicliffe: AEGP 14B G.P +18 380
#note Feeling deflated losing my third in a row, especially because it might have been winnable if I had waited on KRUBI.
