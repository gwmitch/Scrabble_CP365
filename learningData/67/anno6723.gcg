#note 5s fail -  COLBY.   i was thinking COBLY* and stared at it for ever. i figure that i must have been guessing COBLY* in study and havent nailed COLBY yet.  Interestingly COLBYS is good too.  4k GOY is next best.  My plays = sucks according to quackle - though i thought i may be cutely setting up my Y.
