>Periwinkle: AEINRTV 8H V +0 0
#note Playing the V beats exchanging the V handily here. After ex. V, opponent averages 27; after 8H V 8, opponent averages just 7.3 points. Wait, make that H8 V 8; I prefer to open vertically. (Note: This play misscored as 0 - should have been 8)
>Chartreuse: ?AEGORT 8B hATGRO.E +62 62
#note I like my play better than OVERTAGs.
>Periwinkle: AEINRTU E2 ANTIUR.E +68 68
#note Best bingo. TAURINEA was another possibility.
>Chartreuse: ?CEEFIP 3C FI.CE +22 84
#note Somehow I overlooked the simple UF/RE/FER for 29 and a great leave. 12 points of equity right here, yeesh.
>Periwinkle: AAHIRWY 4G HAIRWAY +89 157
#note The Hairway to Steven.
>Chartreuse: ?EEIMNP K4 .IPEMENt +106 190
#note Either WIPEMENT or WIMPENED - WIPEMENT takes an S but is still a bit better, as it doesn't put vowels in hot spots.
>Periwinkle: EEIILUV 8K .ILVE +33 190
>Periwinkle: EEIILUV --  -33 157
#note Yeah, yeah, it's no good without the S. MILVES is a plural of a four. Dammit, I knew that.
>Chartreuse: EGHINTU 8K .EUGH +36 226
#note Wasn't sure of OUTHINGE. This is the best nonbingo, but it's about 15 points worse.
>Periwinkle: EEIILUV N6 VI.UE +19 176
#note Don't like closing the board like this. Maybe UVULI 6E? Quackle hates it.
>Chartreuse: EEIJNOT 4B JET. +31 257
#note Thought of this or JENUE, both of which score. G7 JOO does surprisingly well.
>Periwinkle: AEILOTZ 6D T.ZLA +34 210
#note Know your Bosnian cities!
>Chartreuse: AEFINOO 3L FOO +27 284
#note Surprised this simmed best, but it did. Hopefully he doesn't have the K for a big FOOK play at O1.
>Periwinkle: EGIOSSY O1 GYSO +34 244
#note OSSY scored six more but burned both esses, so I like this - want to keep one for plays at 12K.
>Chartreuse: AEEINNN M8 .NINANE +21 305
#note Nothing else close, obviously.
>Periwinkle: ADEEILS 12E ADELIES +74 318
#note Yay penguins!
>Chartreuse: DELNRRS N12 LERD +18 323
#note Uh, DERL same spot?
>Periwinkle: DIMPQRU 11A QUIMP +44 362
#note Points are worth risking QABAB, QABAL or QASID in reply, but barely.
>Chartreuse: ANOORSX 13A SORAXON +98 421
#note Defined as a "sister transmitter", whatever that means. 98!
>Periwinkle: ABCDIRW F12 ..W +15 377
#note If the S is one of two left in the bag, I'll have the only hooks on DOW remaining (the A and the S). And a block involving ENO won't stop ABCDIRS, as I'd have BRISCAD/DOWA/ENOD 15A! Or SCABRID 15F, if it's not blocked.
>Chartreuse: BDKOOTT B10 K.B.T +42 463
#note Aargh, what do you do here? WOTT/ENO doesn't block anything that forms DOWA and either ENOD or ENOL. KUBOT wins three of eight possible endgames and WOTT wins four, but KUBOT obviously gives me a bigger spread when I do win. I can infer A and S from his setup play, but that doesn't change things that much. Great setup by my opponent here...disappointing not to win after getting SORAXON down late.
>Periwinkle: ABCDIRS 15F SCABRID +100 477
#note That will do.
>Periwinkle:  (DLOOT) +12 489
