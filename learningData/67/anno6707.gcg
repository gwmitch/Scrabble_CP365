>Black: AEEIINO 8D EIEIO +12 12
#note Old MacDonald to the rescue.
>White: AGILVXY 7G XYLA +45 45
#note Briefly considered VIGAL 7C, and XYLA isn't great defensively, but I think you have to take the points here.
>Black: AACNRSS K5 NASCARS +101 113
#note Wow, got away with one here - no S on NASCAR. ARCSANS only. Could have double-doubled on the E column as well, but I wanted the points from XYLAS too. (I took three minutes on the play, but mostly because I wasn't 100% on XYLAS; XYLON doesn't take an S, true - though CYLON and ZYLON do -  but anyway, XYLAS is fine)
>White: DGIITUV 8K .UVID +36 81
#note Cleans up my rack decently. At first I just saw GUIVED or VIGUED D4, but this is obviously way better.
>Black: AMORRUW 6J W.RUM +37 150
#note Warum? Warum nicht?
>White: GHIMPTT D4 GIMP.T +22 103
#note Gah, missed IMPIGHT for a 2x2. Just didn't see it.
>Black: ANORRTW E2 WROT +21 171
#note Chickened out on DARNWORT*, wisely so - it's only RANDWORT. Didn't think of (V)ARROW, which sims a few points better than WROT, but this isn't that bad.
>White: DEHHOPT C3 HEPO +31 134
#note Huh. Quackle likes HOPH L11 29, for the leave I guess, and I need to open the board...maybe I'm overfearing the HOPHE/HOPHI hooks. Not sure.
>Black: AAAJNRU M8 .AJAUNA +36 207
#note Yeah, baby! Hope my opponent doesn't have an S, but still, I can't not take 36 points and a cleaned-up rack.
>White: DEHIOQT 12L Q.O +24 158
#note Game-losing play. Yeah, I need hotspots, and I have the T for QUOT, but there's also QUOF, QUOK and QUON to worry about. DEHIT is okay but not great, especially with no obvious H spot and only a moderate number of viable bingo lanes. Quackle likes taking points with EOHI L10 39, but that blocks lanes and DQT sucks.
>Black: DEFFLLR O12 FELF +62 269
#note Right stuff, right time. 
>White: BDEHIIT 11D DEHIBIT. +78 236
#note And...after my lousy play last turn, I luckbox my way into a bingo.
>Black: ?DDLNRR I9 DR.NDL +12 281
#note Greedy, maybe, but Quackle prefers it over my other thought, L(I)RD in the same spot.
>White: EEIKNOY D11 .OKEY +34 270
#note Okey dokey. With both blanks and two esses out, good to at least limit the 15 row options while taking points. Easy choice.
>Black: ?ELNRSV 15A VEN.L +33 314
#note I saw SLoRVEN B5 but wasn't sure of it. VENYL sims only a few points worse.
>White: ABEEINO N11 B.EA +25 295
#note Debate was between playing it here or at 14B. Wanted to keep more scoring spots open on the board, so I took the less lucrative one. Quackle doesn't agree - it actually prefers the 14B placement by a little. Hmm.
>Black: ?GINRSS B6 GRISSoN +73 387
#note Best.
>White: EIINORT 13C I.O +14 309
#note The sim prefers just fishing off the O here. But really, I've got about no chance. Even if I bingo on row 3 or get a miracle Z play, it surely won't be enough.
>Black: AACEEOU F4 EU +13 400
#note EU does the job; almost anything decent is 100% to win here. Quackle likes ECUA(N) 5G, for reasons I'm not smart enough to figure out.
>White: EGINRTZ 14B GN.IZE +84 393
#note Whoa, didn't believe this fits. And my opponent held it for a while, but I knew there was no way he'd challenge at this point. (It's good.)
>Black: AACEOOT A8 TOOEA +32 432
#note The big Z play shocked me - I didn't even think of it. And I didn't think of TOOEA either, at first. Glad I had five minutes on my clock. Made the play with about 30 seconds left. Every other play in the spot loses. Whew!
>White: ?ERTT G1 fTERT +18 411
#note Yeah, "ftert" sums up how I felt. Couldn't quite pull it off. 
>White:  (AC) +8 419
