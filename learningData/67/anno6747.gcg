#note So I know there's many bingoes that slot the C on the DLS and that's what you're supposed to do... But nationals are in 4 days and I want to send my div2 competition a message by playing something more obscure and low-prob than CELADOn or CODAbLE or CAjOLED.

#note I was missing one tile from my tracking (the L) but strongly thought about XIS setting up  GRAY/RAD/AXIS because the only way to block was to give me GRAY/GLAD or GRAD on the TWS. But I was already up by 220 and didn't want to rub it in.

#note Ended with a final score of 577-325 somehow, but meh. 501 1st game, 577 here, and I'm looking strong for club this week. My previous high 3-game average was 430, so I think I only need like 300 to break that. Can I do it? oooh, the suspense!
