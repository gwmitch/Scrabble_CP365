#note Missing PARAE I10. I should have mentioned that Ruth and I were playing the last game of a tournament, and I didn't need to win, I just needed to lose by less than 83 points. So my plays are little more defensive than they should.

#note I don't know what Quackle's up to here, but it likes fishing off an R for JIVER by 12 points. There's probably a 9 down row 15...
