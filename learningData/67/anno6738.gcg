#note The only tough decision here is whether to play an S or not.  I'd like to give myself the extra chance for a vowel, but LPSS is a strong enough all consonant leave to make it worthwhile to keep the S's a suprise.  However, the problem is that either WONK or KNOW gives him a nice non-S hook.

#note Fail.  My orphan is not working well with this board, but I had several better ways to manage the rack than this.  On the upside, I am at least not leaving much for him.

#note FLEW in either spot might be a touch better than this.  However, there were two N's and only one L remaining.  And playing at F1 seemed to make it much easier for him to hit the triple...

#note A very bad decision.  I knew I was giving back easy scores on the J, but I just couldn't find a very good way of using it.  But I didn't need to rush it out of my hand.  FUDGE trumps all other plays here.
