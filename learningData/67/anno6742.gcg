>Conrad: ?ABEORW 8H ROWABlE +78 78
>Rafi: JLLORSU K5 JOU.L +24 24
#note Quackle likes JOWL, which seems reckless to me. JO is bad because it's too easy for Conrad to shut down the board by hooking OW.
>Conrad: AEEGIIY L8 .IGEYE +26 104
>Rafi: ALLOPRS 14F PALLORS +80 104
>Conrad: AAEEIMT 15F AMIA +34 138
>Rafi: EMOORTU K11 MOO. +27 131
>Conrad: EEELPTT J10 PET +22 160
#note Conrad: I did not know PETT(O).
>Rafi: EIORTUV L1 VIREO +33 164
#note Quackle thinks GUV is only a little worse than VIREO. Is GUV really even worth considering?
>Conrad: EEEILTX M2 TELEX +42 202
>Rafi: DNRSTUU N6 UT.RUS +21 185
#note Quackle is not a fan of the UTERUS. I considered SURE, but hate the DNTU leave. What else can I play? DUNAM, UDO, and UDON look silly to me. Maybe DURST or UTE? I still like my UTERUS.
>Conrad: CEIIKNN I6 IK.N +14 216
#note Nice leave.
>Rafi: AADDNNT H8 .AND +7 192
#note Another tough decision. Quackle likes TOED/PETTO for 17, which I didn't see. Exch. ADDN sims high as well. I felt like I needed to keep lanes open but maybe this is the wrong approach. 
>Conrad: CDEEFIN G9 FIE +25 241
>Rafi: ADHHNTT 11C HATT.. +20 212
#note HAD(IT)H is cool, didn't see it. Maybe HANTED is better to leave a possible TH- word in the O column. Quackle is going insane and prefers TOED again... 
>Conrad: BCDENVY D10 C.VY +24 265
#note Conrad: I made this play way too fast, and it sucks. C(H)EVY is much better.
>Rafi: AACDHNQ 6F QAD. +34 246
>Conrad: BDDEINO H1 BONDE. +36 301
#note Conrad: Correctly chickened out on BIDDE(D)*.
>Rafi: AACHINN 2J CH..IN +34 280
#note CHAIN/CHATTED is probably better. I didn't like the prospect of blocking that lane though, in case I drew the blank. Still, CHAIN gives me another shot at the esses and the blank, and undoubles my A's.
>Conrad: DEIIRST 7F ID +21 322
#note Conrad: Is this insane?
>Rafi: AAEGNWZ O1 G.AWN +39 319
#note Didn't think of WEAZAND, which gives me more shots at the blank and esses. I'm still not sure which is better, because AEZ could lead to some big plays as well.
>Conrad: ?EIIRST B5 ERISTIc +70 392
#note HUGE now
