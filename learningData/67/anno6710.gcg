#note Just barely worth playing.

#note TABU K9 is another possibility.

#note Missing rETICULA, but this is just about as good.

#note Possibly should cover the triple with OYER instead of bingoing. Very close.

#note Rafi: "I really don't see any way I can win by playing HEX for 43, or VEXT for 28. I figure my best shot it to rid myself of the V and X, giving myself a chance at QUATE/QUITE for 54."
>Bing: AADGISU L1 G.ID. +26 321
#note I smelled a rat with the VOX play and thought it might be wise to take out the QUATE threat. Otherwise, GUAVA is a standout.
>Rafi: BCEHQTT H12 ..CH +27 267
#note "Maybe it's better to trade first, but I thought 27 points while opening a lane was worth the bad leave. The H would be tough to block without sacrificing points, and when I trade I'll be drawing to something more bingo prone, like EST or AEST if I'm lucky. Quackle likes keeping CHET on a trade."
>Bing: AAEIRSU 1F EAU +21 342
>Rafi: ABDEQTT -QBT +0 267
#note "I could play BATED for 31 here, threatening QAT on the triple if it stays open (if I draw an A), but I think that's pushing my luck. I figured my best chance was to trade, bingo twice and hope Dave gets the Q."
>Bing: AEFIORS 6J F.RIAE +40 382
#note My lead seemed very secure after this play. Not so!
>Rafi: AADEMST 15D MAST.EAD +67 334
#note "Good thing I threw open that H instead of trading..."
>Bing: ADDEOQS E8 Q. +11 393
#note I didn't give this enough thought. OD 2E is much better; I would only lose to an immediate bingo. In some scenarios I could end up Q-stuck, but a 62-point lead would be enough to hang on.
>Rafi: BEHMRST J14 H. +13 347
#note "BERTH isn't going to be enough to win. I figured I had to fish, and saw that I needed an I for BIMESTER or TIMBERS. Also, I noticed that Dave probably didn't have the I on his rack because otherwise he would have played QAIDS, or QIS, or something like that. Here goes nothing!"
>Bing: ADDENOS 2A DESAND +31 424
#note Damn, down to a 50-50 shot. Looking further back, if the last 3 tiles don't fall exactly N,I,R then I win.
