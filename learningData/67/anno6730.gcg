>Jeff: DNNORTZ 8G TORN +8 8
#note I'm still fuzzy on exchanging strategy... maybe keep the Z? I don't think TORN is too bad.
>Joe: AGTY J6 TA.GY +19 19
>Jeff: ADEINWZ K5 ZIN +28 36
#note I might have considered K10 ADZ if I had seen it, keeping the E. ADZ and TZAR always seem to elude me..
>Joe: EEIOOTW -EEIOOW +0 19
>Jeff: ACDELUW 7C CLAWED +22 58
#note Here's where things go badly downhill. Didn't see any of the L column plays for more points.
>Joe: ELPRTU C7 .ULPRET +24 43
>Joe: ELPRTU --  -24 19
#note The one thing I do right this game; challenging off a phoney.
>Jeff: BGHKPUV -BGHKUV +0 58
#note Watch me go from 6 consonants to 6 vowels in 4 turns. 9D VUGH is best, I didn't see it/  forgot it. Don't know why I chose to keep the P but it doesn't sim too bad, actually.
>Joe: ELPRU D4 PUL.ER +18 37
>Jeff: AIIPSTW 10F WISP. +21 79
#note I knew I had a bingo, but thought it was WATIPIS*. Joe would have challenged off if I had played it, but I think I'm more annoyed by the fact that I didn't see the spot, even to play the phoney. Instead I blow the S for 21 points.
>Joe: ANORTT L4 RATTON +31 68
#note Glad I didn't challenge this. I know RATTEEN, RATTEN, RATTOON, RATOON, but not this one. I was convinced he slipped a phoney past me for the rest of the game.
>Jeff: AABEITV E3 VAT +20 99
#note (O)BIA is less points, but closes the TWS and balances the rack better. I saw it but didn't play it.. there are a bunch of better plays that I didn't see, but VAT just sucks. I'm rewarded with 2 more vowels.
>Joe: CHU 8L .UCH +27 95
#note so much for my lead.
>Jeff: ABEEFII 11D FEE +17 116
#note Again, bad thinking- I didn't play BEEF for 28 because I wanted to keep a consonant!? Like ABII is that much better of a leave? At least play FIE and keep 2 E's instead of 2 I's! Sheesh!
>Joe: AKO 6F OKA +27 122
#note I had the fleeting thought, 'wait, is KET good?', then convinced myself it was a Hebrew letter that could also be spelled KETH. Nope, that's HET you're thinking of.
>Jeff: ABEEIII -ABEIII +0 116
#note And we arrive at the 6 vowel rack, as a reward for crappy playing.  Didn't see 9B AE(R)IE.
>Joe: ?EGISUX N6 EX.USInG +71 193
>Jeff: ?AEENQR 11M Q. +11 127
#note Of course I saw QuAERE, QuEAN, QuEEN and QuEER, but not the spot to play them for 50+ points. But hey, with the blank, I should be able to fish off the Q and bingo soon, right?
>Joe: DU O6 DU. +19 212
>Jeff: ?AEENOR O13 ORA +12 139
#note I see ARENOsE now. Another good reason to go through the alphabet with the blank if you think you might be missing something. Made my usual mistake of playing a lame play after not finding a bingo.
>Joe: EEIINOO -EEIIOO +0 212
>Jeff: ?AEEEIN D11 .EE +12 151
#note missed alienee....
>Joe: AGSSY 14B GASSY +41 253
