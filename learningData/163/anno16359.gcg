>Matthew_Larocque: ADGILOS 8G GOD +10 10
#note Ugh. I miss this one every time. 
>Dean_Saldanha: IPY 7H YIP +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILQSW K5 QIS +33 43
#note Quackle wants me to play SWAIL K7 to setup the Q. I don't think that's going to work. I'd like to keep the S, but YIP is too dangerous to leave alone.
>Dean_Saldanha: FIT L4 FIT +25 43
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELOWZ 9E ALOW +21 64
#note Sim also likes M2 AWA to setup ZOE(A)_, but it seems likely that it would get blocked too.
>Dean_Saldanha: ?ABOPRS 10B SAPROBe +85 128
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEERVZ -  +0 64
#note Well, I tried to challenge more than I usually do. Didn't always work out. SAPROBIC is the adjective!
>Dean_Saldanha: EEIRV 8A REIVE +39 167
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEERVZ M3 ZA +27 91
#note Down 100, so lets try to milk the Z.
>Dean_Saldanha: EFO 11A FOE +10 177
>Matthew_Larocque: AEERV A11 .EVER +36 127
#note Missed rack.

>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLNRT O4 KILTER +61 215
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLNRT --  -61 154
#note This was my chance to get back in it. I almost played TINKLER but I wasn't sure, then caved in and made this horrifying play. I was pretty sure *FARK was no good, and TINKLER sounds pretty plausible even if I wasn't sure. Plus I seriously need the points. I dropped the ball here big time.
>Dean_Saldanha: ADEGOR O4 DOGEAR +40 293
#note Punishing errors.

>Dean_Saldanha: AX 7B AX +36 329
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILNRT N8 LaTRINE +69 231
#note Yeah, I drew a blank on a single tile fish! Seriously. But it's much too late, cannot undo the awfulness now.
>Dean_Saldanha: ABHU M12 HABU +31 360
>Matthew_Larocque: AEJMNST 15L J.ST +64 295
#note Lucking into that 300 barrier.
>Dean_Saldanha: AHTW L10 WHAT +35 395
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMNNT F5 NE +10 305
#note Hmm. That's too bad. But I don't think I'd have played this, at first I thought it was REMNANT spelled a different way. I'm so bad. Bad at english!
>Dean_Saldanha: EILTU 15A .UTILE +7 402
#note Blocky block.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELMNOT 14D LAM +25 330
#note LAM? More like LAME! How can I play the phony *OMENTAS in a game of scrabble.... and then not play LOMENTA here? What a trainwreck.

#note -20. So many bad plays, I should have lost by more then this!
