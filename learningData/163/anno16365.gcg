>Josh: IQ H7 QI +22 22
#note Other placement seems competitive with this placement. Failed to consider it!
>Bernard: BI I6 BI +17 17
>Josh: DFILOPW 5H WOLF +25 47
#note This or FOWL? I chose this cause not very many ____W fives (same with ____F), but also because this doesn't allow fives ending in E making E(F).
>Bernard: CERSTUV 9B CURVETS +76 93
>Josh: ?DIOPST L1 DePOSIT +83 130
#note I considered POSTDI(V)e here cause I was pretty sure Bernard would challenge and then try to add an S once it was accepted. He tells me that would have worked. Do I play DISPORT or POSITED for 4 less here?
>Bernard: DELNOSU B7 UN.LOSED +76 169
#note E4 UNSOL(V)ED! Damn, well I wouldn't have challenged. UNCLOSED just seemed stupid to me.

>Bernard: EINORRT 13A R.ORIENT +68 237
#note Uh oh, in trouble here
>Josh: AAEEKVW 1H WAVE. +36 166

>Bernard: FIZ D12 F.IZ +52 364
>Josh: ?AGIORU N2 GIAOURs +72 276
#note I thought to score better would be more important and hope he has crap. Not sure if I'm right about that or not.
>Bernard: IX 10F XI +52 416
#note Of course :(
>Josh: EEMOOST 15D .OOM +15 291
#note I don't know, should I really just chance ZOOMS? I thought he would panic after this. I didn't consider that he could have ED, ING.
>Bernard: HY H13 .HY +84 500
>Bernard: HY --  -84 416
#note Yup, panic
>Josh: CEEORST H11 CO.ES +72 363

>Josh: AEEGRRT O9 GREATER +84 447
#note Jackpot!
>Bernard: AEHJTYY -  +0 428
#note Instachallenged :(. He should have thought about this, as a lot of his plays have a very good chance of winning... He really thought I was just desperate, but I had other places to go that he didn't notice. This really seals it for me
>Josh: BEIMNNP B1 BENNI +22 469
#note I should have thought about this a bit more and found 04 BINE/BIN...
>Bernard: AEHJTYY -  +0 428
