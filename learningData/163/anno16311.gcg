>Heather_Drumm: BKOOR 8H BROOK +32 32
#note I immediately starting thinking of BROOK extensions, and worrying about them

#note UNALI(K)E.

#note Maybe OWN instead?, OWNED?
>Heather_Drumm: ELT 8H .....LET +42 86
#note A small brook? Brooks aren't small enough already? This word didn't make sense
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEENPU -  +0 31
#note Challenged
>Heather_Drumm: IIIII -IIIII +0 86
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEENPU L3 DEBUN. +26 57
#note 10J PE first? I was holding that for next turn.
>Heather_Drumm: EHRTZ G3 HERTZ +52 138
#note Ay caramba!
>Joshua_Sokol: AAELMPX H1 PLEX +85 142
#note APEX instead, but at least I had a comeback!
>Heather_Drumm: IIIII -IIIII +0 138
>Joshua_Sokol: AACEMST K5 AM +20 162
#note CASEMATE! I probably didn't know it.
>Heather_Drumm: ?EIINNS O1 tINNIES. +74 212
>Joshua_Sokol: ACERSTT 13B CATTERS +79 241
#note phony!
>Heather_Drumm: AEILNOR D8 ORIEN.AL +70 282
#note Probably released her hold cause I gave her this. Nice draw!
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEIMOU 8A MIA.U +21 262
#note I didn't know (L)EUCOMA, even now! CAE(C)UM neither... AECIUM I think I knew, ACU(L)EI too. This isn't too amazing of a play
>Heather_Drumm: AIJ 15A JAI. +33 315
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEHOPR 10J PORCH +43 305
#note Two new ones, PROCHE(I)n and PO(E)CHoRE. I don't kow why I didn't see EuPHOR(I)C or POuCH(I)ER/ POaCHI(E)R besides blank blindness. COP(P)ERAH is also a new one, but not CHOPp(I)ER. I think I must have seen CHOPPIER but thought PORCH was better.

#note Other QA(I)D to leave the M openish? Probably.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFFGGS 11D .GG +10 349

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EORSTY --  -66 366
#note Damn, she blocked FORESTRY and FORESTAY! I took all of the time I had left to find the most plausible thing to play on the P. I looked at -TYPE words, KEYPORTS*, TYPEROWS*, OROTYPES*, but couldn't find the only bingo available, SEROTYPE, which I could have guessed as being good, and probably more plausible than what I attempted...
>Heather_Drumm: DEGINST J2 DINGE +26 449
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EORSTY 13K STORY +25 391
#note It's still available! It doesn't win though...
