>Akiva: CEITU 8D CUTIE +20 20
>Josh: EIIRUUV -IIUUV +0 0
#note Not playing (C)IVIE. Maybe I should keep EIRV though.
>Akiva: MNOO 7G MOON +19 39
>Josh: ?AEFIRT K2 FAIREsT +74 74
#note Damn, I missed E5 FIg(U)RATE and, 6F FAtTIER
>Akiva: BNO 9E NOB +22 61
>Josh: DDEENSX L4 DEX +39 113
>Akiva: EEHR 8K .HERE +36 97
>Josh: ADEGNOS L8 .OG +7 120
#note Why fish here :(
>Akiva: BOP 7M BOP +23 120
>Josh: ADEMNNS E8 ..MAN +14 134
#note Not sure what to do here, I don't think I should play off one tile. Besides, I'm trying to bait challenges against the weakest player in my group.
>Akiva: III -III +0 120
>Josh: DDEFNSS J1 FEND +24 158
#note Hmm maybe N6 F(OR)DS.
>Akiva: ?DEEHST 11H HEaDSET +78 198
>Josh: DIOPQSS 13C QIS +32 190
#note oops, blank blindness missing J10 Q(a)IDS/Q(a)DIS.
>Akiva: ANOSTU O11 SNOUT +29 227
#note I think (H)AUNT is clearly better. He layed it down first and then played SNOUT. He didn't have another S.
>Josh: ACDEOPS 10C CA.P +27 217
#note Considered C(H)EAPS but missed C(H)EAPO, damn. I also somehow didn't consider (H)OPED. Those are two clearly better plays than mine, even though mine isn't too shabby.
>Akiva: AK 6N KA +38 265
>Josh: DEIOSUY H11 .YOID +48 265
#note He almost challenged
>Akiva: AEV M11 .AVE +14 279
>Josh: AEIIRSU D4 AURI. +14 279
#note Considered (C)AI(Q)UE but was too afraid of the Z. I didn't  see J10 until next turn. My play is still probably better though.
>Akiva: GLY 5D .GLY +16 295
>Josh: AEIIISZ 10J ZI. +66 345
#note Now I see it obviously. I really don't like the fact that this was anyone's game until I drew this.
>Akiva: RTU 1G TUR. +21 316
>Josh: AEIILRS C13 .I +11 356
>Akiva: IJL F2 JIL. +27 343
>Josh: AEILRST 15F RE.TAILS +68 424
#note Seems safest and best. Sim agrees. Sim also doesn't realize Akiva will challenge :)
>Akiva: EEGLVWW -  +0 343
>Josh: AANOR 12D A.NO. +20 444
#note Damn, -1 to 14F AR(I)A
>Akiva: EEGLVWW 14A VE.L +17 360
#note Because of 13G W(O)VE though, Akiva had just given up. -16 for him
>Josh: AR 9N AR +16 460
