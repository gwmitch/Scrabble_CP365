#note quackle prefers exchanging, but I disagree... I think opening the lane takes priority here, because he is very likely to block rows 10 and 11 with his next play, making a comeback very difficult for me if I don't have another lane.

#note his last couple of plays tell me he is holding on to something juicy.
>Nigel_Peltier: BEIIJRV 4A JIB. +23 126
#note thought I would have a decent shot at having JIVER stay open for me, but I was wrong in this case... unsure which is better here, this or JIBE 11B

>Nigel_Peltier: EHIRTVY 11J TIVY +22 148
#note THEY 11C is the play. or THY 11i is good too. I remember thinking HER is good with the C up top, but really I should respect his rack. I believe I forgot to consider the strength of his rack while making this decision.

#note anagram fits too. also CONCLuDE is there for what it's worth. UNCLOYED is a new one to me.
