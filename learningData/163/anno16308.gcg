>Joshua_Sokol: BCILOSZ H7 BIZ +28 28
#note This or COZ? CIBOL? Interesting first play.
>Scott_Kitchen: EEV 10F VEE +29 29
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLOOPS I2 COPOLiS +66 94
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLOOPS --  -66 28
#note I saw this string of letters on a restaurant near my house. I thought it was a food rather than just a name. I took a long time with this rack, and I missed two I didn't know, SCOLLOP and PODSOLIC, and two I did know, COPILOTS and PICCOLOS!
>Scott_Kitchen: AGP G6 GAP +16 45
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CLOOPS 11H SCOOP +34 62
#note Now I had SCOOP(AB)Le available! GAP also yields COPLOtS and COLlOPS, both of which I didn't know, and SCOLlop is still available! Boy, that's a lot of bingos missed in two turns!
>Scott_Kitchen: IIIII -IIIII +0 45
>Joshua_Sokol: ?LSSTWX J10 W.S +14 76
#note W(O)TS? W(O)ST? TW(O)S? I should try to play more tiles for a vowel.
>Scott_Kitchen: EF 12L EF +18 63
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ELSTUX N8 LUXaTES +114 190
#note Great pickup!
>Scott_Kitchen: AEINRTT -  +0 63
#note I got you back Scott! Challenge!
>Joshua_Sokol: DDELNOV 8L VE.D +36 226
#note O5 DEVON perhaps? 8J NODD(L)E? This looks good enough
>Scott_Kitchen: AEINRTT 14G TERTIAN. +60 123
#note Weird, he had a lot of higher-scoring options available.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDLMORW H13 D.W +21 247
#note I preferred to keep a vowel, but maybe I should play 15F DOM.
>Scott_Kitchen: CNO I6 CON +17 140
>Joshua_Sokol: DELMNOR M7 D.MO +28 275
#note I knew I had something in mind. I kept DOM for this turn!
>Scott_Kitchen: AB 15L BA +16 156
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLNRU 6I .ULL +8 283
#note L4 UNLI(V)E! I didn't know UNLIVES, only UNVEILS. Otherwise this is good as it doesn't open new things, but it doesn't score very well...
>Scott_Kitchen: HIL L3 HIL. +14 170
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIINRR M2 DIN +20 303
#note Not giving him anything to work with.
>Scott_Kitchen: IIUU -IIUU +0 170
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIRRU O5 RUE. +5 308
#note Don't know why I did this as there's another D open. I suppose that I preferred he bingo with the D in DEW, which doesn't make too much sense.
>Scott_Kitchen: AO F9 O.A +6 176
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIRRY 13B ARRAYE. +27 335
#note K2 RARE(L)Y is cool! I guess I could still cut entropy and play ARIARY E4 (I didn't know the word at the time).
>Scott_Kitchen: EHMN B10 HEM.N +36 212
#note Nice phony! 2-1 Scott this game :)
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINQU D8 INQUI.E +34 369
#note I don't remember my last tile, but it was something I couldn't work with
>Scott_Kitchen: FGOR 15C FROG +27 239
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIJOY A8 JOEY +52 421
>Scott_Kitchen: AINOSTT E2 STATION +66 305
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIIKRT C3 TRAIKs +30 451
#note 2A bRIT(S)KA! D1 KAInIT! 3C TI(T)lARK. This wasn't number 1.
