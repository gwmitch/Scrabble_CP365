#note not sure what to do here, various exchanges and playing through with THING all sim very closely. i suppose i like points. CHT is the best thing to keep probably or CH.

#note quackle likes AVA or maybe 3I VASAL, 6F VAT, etc. i don't know what is right here, but i know those close the board and LAVAS opens it. (-1)

#note quackle likes FEU keeping AESW better, gives up slightly fewer points, and AESW is an arguably better leave. i will need the W to score next turn and then try bingoing, because the U won't help much. (-4)

#note i was torn between C6 GEUM and C12 AMU. it clearly seems like GEUM is a much better play but i didn't like it for a few reasons. i thought it was too easy for him to block on the E column with a decently high scoring play, and then i didn't like AES through the A, which would be the only 8-lane left. still the lane on 2 looks ok and GEUM is much more likely than AMU to bingo next turn. i thought playing AMU might also pressure him into making a mistake if he attempted to block that. still though, it just seems like a mistake.

#note i actually didn't see FETS 5C at all, or just thought i needed to bingo. there could be ways for me to win after FETS although it still seems pretty unlikely. i saw NU 14B while quackling, but even that is pretty blockable, so i'm not sure what i can play.
