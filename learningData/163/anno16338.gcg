#note Hi, gl...
>axcertypo: ACEEGIT C7 G.E +7 7
#note I already thought the game was over unless I got a lucky pull after this, which is why I played it. I hate overlapping on my first turn after my opponent bingos, especially if that opponent is a defensive player such as Chris Tallman. You can call this a mistake if you want.
>VictoryLap: EEFIIUY 7F FEY +23 125
#note A very Chris Tallman-like play here. I totally agree with it, despite it's ugly ugly leave. Especially after a play like GEE.

He thought of FIE(R)Y and exchanging but FEY blocked lanes and restricted the right side of the board quite a lot.
>axcertypo: ?ACEEIT I8 .EACTIvE +61 68
#note Only playable bingo, but the question is, should I really play it? I also could play 6A TEA to threaten the 3x3 and it is quite possible that Chris doesn't have anything decent to block, knowing him.
>VictoryLap: EEIISUW J5 IWIS +32 157
#note It's really between this, E(T)UI 12H and exchanging. I like this. The leave isn't horrendous.

Chris also considered EW(E) to block the 3x3 and it was close in his mind but really after I draw 7 he shouldn't sacrifice that much to block a 3x3 threat, even though he could get burn one time out of 100.
>axcertypo: AAEIKLV B5 AVA +17 85
#note Since Chris had nothing to play on the final E in (R)EACTIvE, I thought I should gamble and try for a 3x3 next turn, but the only realy way to prevent Chris from blocking the 3x3 next turn is by playing something so volatile he really would have a hard time deciding what to play next turn rather than pouncing on the E. Most people would probably see this as another error, as I have plays for 40+ points available such as H4 VAKIL, but I really felt that I needed quite a bit more than 44 points and a two-vowel leave to win this game.
>VictoryLap: EEHINPU A1 UNHIP +37 194
#note As expected Chris draws quite well into his EEU. He missed 3 plays he didn't know existed, 11B EUPHENI(C), 11E PENU(C)HI and 11E PENU(C)HE. Other than that, this play seems correct, and none of his good options gets rid of the biggest threat to Chris' lead.
>axcertypo: DEEIKLS 15H S.EDLIKE +176 261
#note For the second time my gamble worked!
>VictoryLap: AAEEFLM A7 FEMALE +43 237
#note Maybe FAME, same spot? I like this.

Chris considered FLAME too but it was too much to sacrifice in his mind, 6 points and 5 leave points or something.

>axcertypo: CEENPSU N12 PUC. +24 285
#note So I knew PENUCHES and saw the option through an H, but I completely missed 5E EUPNE(I)C, the quite obvious best play. Makes up for Chris' missed plays on UNHIP but not really since he didn't know the words.
>VictoryLap: ?AAGNRV 5E RAVAG.Ng +94 331
#note Would have prevented this!
>axcertypo: EEIMNST 10G ET.MINES +68 353
#note He blocked my ENMIT(I)ES! This seems like the obvious thing to do. It blocks the biggest (or the second biggest) scoring spot on this board down column O and scores the most of all the options.
>VictoryLap: GIORSWX B10 XI +52 383
>axcertypo: ADIIORZ 4H ZA +45 398
#note This didn't actually seem automatic, and rightly so as a lot of other plays seem to contend, such as 11E IODI(C) which does a whole lot of good, N6 ZORI(S) which is slightly gutsy but there's only one A and one E in the pool, so I'm far more worried about a response at L8, 11H A(C)ID maybe, which I don't quite understand but it does leave me ZORI for next turn and 12L ZI(P). The reason ZA isn't quite as good as it may seem is that it gives him a few options for ___ZA words (GYOZA, BAIZA, BRAZA), gives him bulky plays at I3 and leaves me with a pretty bad set of DIIOR as backlash from scoring so high. I think if I were to go back I would play IODI(C). I didn't consider it. The psychological factor is strong with ZA at least, as I retain the lead, especially if he doesn't really have a counterplay.
>VictoryLap: GOORSTW 9M WOG +22 405
#note Hmm, maybe the other WOG at 3I over this. I'm not really happy with what this one opens (ING words, some overlaps if I have the case A, no extra lane created (C2-I2)), but I suppose in both cases if I have an A I can score massively. Perhaps 3I WORST/WORTS is worth considering.

Chris says he considered GROW, GROWS, WORTS but didn't like WORTS as it gave back J2 for a J-bomb.
>axcertypo: DEIIOOR 11H I.ED +26 424
#note I didn't spot too awesome plays here as well as IODI(C) (again). (H)OODIER is quite obvious as it removes the ___ZA threat, scores, and empties the bag quicker while keeping a vowel with a consonant heavy pool. It seems to be the best play, pretty obviously. Also notable is K9 O(I)DIOI(D)!!! That would have been awesome! Since the pool is consonant-heavy the sim also likes RI(C)ED over my play for what it's worth.
>VictoryLap: NOORSTT 13C TORTON.S +68 473
#note So I guess O(I)DIOI(D) eh? I knew WOG was fishy, in hindsight maybe block really the only decent lane instead of selfishly increasing my own score. 
>axcertypo: HIJNOOR 12D JO +38 462
#note This turn I considered 12D JOIN, 12D JO and possibly 3I JO, but 3I JO seemed quite unnecessarily dangerous. I didn't consider JOHN in the same spot, which seems quite the valid alternative. I wanted to threaten an IN(G) word next turn on column O, which is why I opted for playing JO. I didn't consider 3I HONOR, which is a very good play, as I could draw a devastating JIN/JIB type play on J2 next turn and if blocked I would still have JI(G) for 33! The sim also clearly prefers JOIN to JO as it gives me more shots at H1. HONOR also does the honorable job of blocking that scary hotspot.
>VictoryLap: DDNRRTU O6 DRU. +18 491
#note C2 RUDD perhaps?

Chris thought the spot he created with WOG was more dangerous so he should block it, rightly so.
>axcertypo: AHILNOR 3I HALON +35 497
#note Here I considered HORAL in the same spot but decided against it because it gave Chris the ability to overlap, but I don't think I should have been worried about that as there is already a scoring spot at 14B for him. I missed the better HILAR in the same spot. Not as good a move as I expected. I also considered fishing for BRA(ZA) but if I didn't take the I3 spot I felt he would anyway. ON and IN are much better leaves to have with this pool and board than IR.

#note Is TR(ICED) valid? If so I'll take the tie!
>VictoryLap: RT 11F TR.... +11 524
>VictoryLap:  (IR) +4 528
#note I blew it! I made some gambles that worked out but overall didn't play as good as I expected. I need to work on good setup leaves etc. But this was a crazy game! I wonder if there's ever been such a high tie!
