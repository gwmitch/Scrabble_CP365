>cesar: BEINOPT 10B PINOT +28 46
#note i always seem to play super closed against rafi for some reason. why not just EBON. (-3)
>rafi: EX 10I EX +31 106
>cesar: ?ABEIST 11G BATIStE +82 128
#note lame play; why didn't i look harder for 11C BAwTIES/BAnTIES? (-15.5)
>rafi: IQ 11A QI +15 121
>cesar: DILNNPU 12D UNPIN +23 151
#note LUPIN is a word, but DUNLIN which i saw is probably better because of the P spot at 8C. (-1.5)
>rafi: EEZ 13G ZEE +50 171
>cesar: DDGJLOR D5 JORD.. +16 167
#note yes, DODGER M7 is super-creative, but does the O spot there stay open enough? i really hated playing JORDAN though. (-6.5)
>rafi: EIILOT 14B IOLITE +31 202
>cesar: DGIKLSU 15E DISK +48 215
#note this is actually pretty interesting. i was expecting DISK to sim great just because of the points, but JUG results in many points next turn! he might not have the S and i can use the hook next turn too. (-2.5)
>rafi: HOY E4 HOY +41 243
#note i muttered "i hated making that play" and hit the table, the lady filming told me to "do that again". i don't think it sounded as legit the second time. lol.

>rafi: EFRR M9 FR.ER +24 267
>cesar: ACEEEUW L7 EWE +15 258
#note massive miss here of L10 EtWEE although CLEW at F2 sims second best. i need to get my own scoresheets already and a good way to track so it's obvious the bag is very consonant heavy. that's the main reason i didn't want to play CLEW. (-13.5)
>rafi: DLNOTU M2 UNTOLD +23 290
#note great, now he's gonna draw the blank
>cesar: ACEEGRU F2 C.AG +29 287
#note B1 REFUGE is a very interesting choice here, but it seems like it gives back too many points. too volatile. i don't know. it does turn over two more for the blank.
>rafi: GMNOO K4 MONGO +26 316
>cesar: AEEHORU L4 UH +26 313
#note i really need to find HUMATE here. i wish i was better. L11 THOU looks decent too. (-5.5)
>rafi: DRY 4E ..RDY +14 330
>cesar: AAAEEOR 3H AA +12 325
#note i suppose 2A AE is best if he doesn't have the R. that could work out ok. (-4)
