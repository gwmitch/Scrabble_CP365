#note I get WEBLOG but not BOWLEG :(

In my head I had WEBLOG and G(O)WK about equal after considering opponent skill (she might challenge and I don't like scoring less and holding 1-pointers against weaker players)

#note WOW I knew I misplayed this turn, but VODKA is just not a word I should miss. My thinking with this play was that I would draw and E and hit EVOKE. It's way too cute to pass up DOTH though, or especially VODKA. Yikes I'm bad.

#note Aaaand now I'm making up 5s. I played FUG over VUG for the same EVOKE reasons, but again I'm just stupid and greedy and it's not smart.

#note I definitely should have challenged but I suck. I guess if I didn't suck GRATH would never have been there in the first place. 
>Matt_Canik: CDKORSU 2J KOS +43 194
#note RUDDOCKS is a 94 point bingo I didn't know. I also inexplicably miss the VIROIDS hook here. It's not that I didn't know the word (I'm going to play it later, even), it's just that I didn't notice it. I got so excited bu KOS that I just stopped looking. 

The biggest enemy of a great play is a good play.

>Matt_Canik: AEGINOR 2B ORANGE +27 296
#note I don't know if I should expect her to see TONETTE or POTTEEN and it's going to be really hard to block the M line without opening something better, so I decided to grab all the points I could here and outrun the bingo if she ends up pulling it.

>Matt_Canik: AADIJTT C2 .AJA +22 318
#note I KNOW she has the O, but she was really low on time and is a slow anagrammer so I rushed this play. Awful oversight of TAJ 7D.
