>Juraj: BILTZ 8H BLITZ +52 52
#note STOP! Juraj's play here brings up a good point: **Do not BLITZ through this game.** I want you to make an effort to actually find the best play instead of just idly scrolling through the moves until you get to the good one. You aren't an Internet zombie, this isn't a twitter feed of lolcats. Treat this like an actual game, already! *Nigel* would find the good play. ::glares disapprovingly::
>Carl: ?ILNOUW K4 UNWI. +16 16
>Juraj: DEEW H8 .EDEW +15 67
>Carl: ?ACCILO 11D ALOp.CIC +94 110
#note Voila! Like most bingos with two Cs, this one required a certain tenacity (about five minutes' worth, if I recall), particularly as the P is in unintuitive letter to make the blank with this rack. That there are other, easier options such as CALICOs adds extra righteousness to ALOpECIC. Glad I didn't give up!
>Juraj: EOT L4 TOE +17 84
#note Later this week: stay tuned for, da da da dun! Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown! This one wasn't quite awesome enough to make the cut. It was mostly just difficult for me to spot. Your mileage may vary.
>Carl: AAEEEOT 12B TOEA +14 124
#note The "da da da dun" was Beethoven's 5th Symphony, by the way. I hope that got you excited.

#note Quackle plays through with AI 9L (-4.5)

#note SAB 9K sims best. (-3)
>Juraj: JOY B6 JOY +36 197
>Carl: EIILNSS 13H SILENI +26 209
#note Fishing with ID 15A sims best, but it's close (-3.5). As with the exchange a few turns ago, sometimes it's better to dump rather than risk multiple turns of low scores. 
>Juraj: FIR 14M FIR +17 214
>Carl: ENOPRSV O12 PE.V +36 245
#note Or PROVERS O9. They sim about even.
>Juraj: HP 13A H.P +24 238
>Carl: IINNORS 15H INIONS +27 272
#note Quackle isn't much fond of this play. From my perspective there's only one O unseen and not too many ways to score besides Row 15. INIONS C3 wins the sim handily. (-5)
