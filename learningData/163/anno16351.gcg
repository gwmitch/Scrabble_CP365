>Geoff_Thevenot: EIRVW 8D WIVER +30 30
>Matt_Canik: BDINOUV I4 VODUN +22 22
#note BOVID or VODUN? I thought BOVID gave so much back that it'd fall a few points below its static valuation (and it did), but for some reason VODUN also fell below its value by a decent margin. -2.5
>Geoff_Thevenot: CEILPTY E4 PYEL.TIC +110 140
#note wow, he actually had two double doubles on this play...
>Matt_Canik: BEIINSY -  +0 22
#note I was expecting Geoff to phoney me if he felt he needed to, and I had never heard of PYELITE*. But I didn't think of PYELITIS. I challenged. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: DGHILT G3 LIGHT.D +16 156
>Matt_Canik: BEIINSY 4C YI. +16 38
#note INBYE/BLIGHTED
>Geoff_Thevenot: Q D3 Q. +11 167
>Matt_Canik: BEFINST 10D F.B +14 52
#note I don't want to knock out the front hook to LIGHTED. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AJT 2F TAJ +25 192
>Matt_Canik: EEINOST 4I .OE +6 58
#note I've got to try something to get out of this mess.

>Matt_Canik: AENOORS 1K A.OON +21 185
#note Could play BOOR here to put the R in a good spot, but I've really just resigned this game.

>Matt_Canik: EEMNORS 5B ME +9 246
#note Only one E left, and he can't completely block this without that E unless he has a 5 down to that W. Plays at 6A occasionally give back 3x3 opportunities and those at 6B allow double overlaps.

#note Story of the game, I guess
