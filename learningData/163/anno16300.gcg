#note Too fishy probably. (AWA)RD seems better if I want to fish, but even so, I should probably just burn my S for points with L3 DRIPS.

#note Well jeez. I missed TrIsECT, sTaTICE and sCoTTIE with QUOINS. At least this was pretty defensive and drew a challenge.

#note I didn't really like any of my options here as I remember this game, but this was a crazy move. I'm not quite sure why I made it, as it's in stark contrast with my usual paranoid style of play. I know I was thinking that if she had an s she had an s but that if she didn't I had a good chance to score big with my X next turn. This play was greedy and pretty stupid now that I look at it again.

#note No, don't tell me... This really looks to be what I wrote down as my leave. I guess I was on to something with ONO and just completely screwed up.

#note I think this was my leave. I guess I was trying to block a bit? Even if I was this is a pretty indecent play.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: AELRRSU O4 SURREAL +79 286
#note Weird choice between this and N6 for one more point. I think she made the right decision.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEJMPP 13J JAMBE +47 355
#note No, JAMB. I do remember deciding to play JAMBE over JAMB for some obscure reason, like fear of a monster overlap on column N with (JAMB)E or something.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: AI N10 AI +8 294
>Joshua_Sokol: DDLPPSY O13 SPY +41 396
#note I probably didn't know TYPP back then but I wouldn't have played it anyway, as the sim is suggesting at E2 or D2.

>Joshua_Sokol: DDELPV F6 VE. +15 411
#note Nowhere on the list. Probably -20 or something. (HE)LVED and (HE)LPED are my only outs in 2.
