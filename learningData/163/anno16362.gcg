>Matthew_Larocque: DEGIINP H4 PIING +22 22
#note Did not know PIDGIN.
>Walker_Willingham: AINO 4H .IANO +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEEEOU 5J DUE +17 39
#note EDUCE is pretty nuts, I don't need to take things that far. I'm liking the defense of DUE.
>Walker_Willingham: AX G5 AX +20 34
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEFOS 3I OF +16 55
#note Vowel heavy, but keeps things tight. E(N)FACE is dangerous but FE(N)CE is an alternative.
>Walker_Willingham: ?ABGINS 8H .ABbINGS +86 120
>Walker_Willingham: ?ABGINS --  -86 34
#note Walker already showed me that he's not afraid to make up words, so I called his bluff here, plus I get to bingo next turn. Although afterwards he said he thought it sounded good.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEEOS 8C ECOtA.ES +63 118
#note Both ACEROSE and ACETOSE are adjectives that don't take an S hook - I don't think I'd have challenged an S hook on either of them. In that sense my play probably worked out for the better.
>Walker_Willingham: ?ABGINS M2 BAStING +82 116
>Matthew_Larocque: EHLMNRT E7 M.NTH +20 138
#note THERM(E)/L score well but I wasn't sure on either play.
>Walker_Willingham: FOY N1 FOY +31 147
>Matthew_Larocque: EELORRU O2 OE +13 151
#note Kinda have to do this.... should play EURO though.
>Walker_Willingham: CDLMTU C3 MULCT.D +30 177
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLQRRU -  +0 151
#note I really thought MULCT was a noun. 
>Walker_Willingham: ORU D11 OUR +11 188
>Matthew_Larocque: EGLQRRU J8 .UQ +32 183
>Walker_Willingham: DEOV 13C D.OVE +20 208
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLRRT 4A GR.EL +16 199
#note Flaking out on DROVER.
>Walker_Willingham: DIT H13 DIT +23 231
>Matthew_Larocque: EHRRSTY D2 RY. +13 212
#note Plenty of vowels left, EHRST might lead to a bingo.
>Walker_Willingham: AIP K9 PIA +25 256
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHRSTW I8 .H +21 233
#note Go away W. But I should take more points here. l11 WRATH or L10 SWARTH/SWATHE, for example. Even HAW, I mean why am I keeping the stupid W?
>Walker_Willingham: BEIZ L11 BIZE +34 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AEORSTW 15J WASTER +47 280
#note Tough call, but 47 points almost catches me up. I couldn't figure out whether it was better to use the Z or S-hook. Something like M10 ROTA or M12 TARO were tempting too. Walker was gonna score pretty well no matter what I did here though. There's 3 unseen As and only 1 unseen S, so from my point of view maybe using the Z is better. The play offers such big comebacks, seems like a play he would make if he had the key letters, so I guessed that he had an S. The other option I have is (N)OW fishing for a bingo again, but I opted to play it safe.
>Walker_Willingham: ARST M11 STAR. +41 331
#note Ouch. I'm in trouble now.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLNOV A4 .LOVE +27 307
#note Scores 27, gets rid of the otherwise useless V.
>Walker_Willingham: AEE 8L A.EE +18 349
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKLNNT 14K K..NE +30 337
#note Getting close, but Walker would have to really fumble to lose this one.
>Walker_Willingham: AIJRW O7 J.W +13 362
#note I think he thought he was blocking my out, and missed the other spot I could play it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNT G10 INL.T +7 344
#note Down to the wire, had about 10 seconds left on this turn.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AIR) +6 350
#note I think the H(UP) turn was silly and then playing WASTER instead of parallel playing the Z caused me to fall short, aside from challenging MULCTED.
