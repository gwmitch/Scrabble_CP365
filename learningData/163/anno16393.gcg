>Gabriel: EHOW 8G HOWE +20 20
>Josh: ABDEFIO 7G ABODE +29 29
#note 7G OBA/ABO is also interesting. I decided to take points. Maybe I should play ADOBE, which I was unsure of, and I also didn't realize ABODED was good, even though I think I would have played ABODING.
>Gabriel: EEW 9H WEE +26 46
>Josh: BEFIIST 6E FIB +18 47
#note BEFITS L2 and points? I don't think it's worth 13
>Gabriel: AGKU K9 KAGU +29 75
>Josh: CEISSTU E3 CUI. +18 65
#note The moment I entered my rack on here I saw ICTUSES. I didn't know CUTISES I guess. I guess I just blanked out here. I looked a while at my rack and just couldn't decipher it. I just gave up and played this. Considered adding an S but the extra information it gives him stopped me. No matter that he can't do anything about me having an S or not. CUIF and CUIFS are flipflopping on the sim, of course behind all of my bingo spots.
>Gabriel: FORR 4D F.ROR +18 93
>Josh: ELOSSTU 13H TOUSELS +76 141
>Josh: ELOSSTU --  -76 65
#note Cool, I have TOUSELS on my rack. TOUSLES is the phony one, right? TOUZELS TOUZLES TOUSELS, I just checked that a week ago, right?...

I saw OUTLESS*, thought it was phony, and just completely missed SOLUTES and LOTUSES this turn.
>Gabriel: AAEEGRX I2 AREA +14 107
#note Actual rack. Good thing about phonying is that Gabriel used up a ton of time on this turn trying to figure out what to do. Afterwards he told me he really should have played AGEE instead.
>Josh: ELOSSTU L3 LOTUSES +87 152
#note Now I see it!
>Gabriel: EGOX J1 OX +50 157
#note Scored as 52.
>Josh: AAILNNT H2 TA.N +18 170
#note Considered TI(C)AL for points, but I missed K3 ALIN(E), which seems decent enough. I still like my play, as it's defensive, scores enough, keeps IN for IN(G) type plays, or just an overall good leave, AILN. The sim thinks it's close with ALIN(E).
>Gabriel: ?EGINPT 12H dEP.TING +74 231
>Josh: AEILLNT H7 ...L +9 179
#note Had I seen TILLA(G)E I would have played it. I felt like ATIN(G)LE and ELATIN(G) were just ridiculously dangerous, especially since he's just drawn 7 tiles, a couple of which will usually be clunky and high-scoring. I don't like fishing off one tile but what decent options do I have? I saw that this created (BOWL)E(D). The sim prefers it, but what do you think?
>Gabriel: EIV O12 .IVE +24 255
>Josh: AEILLNT 15H TENAILL. +77 256
#note I was pissed that I drew the last L, but quite happy when he laid (G)IVE down.
>Gabriel: MV M11 V.M +16 271
>Josh: HIJNOOO 14F JOIN +31 287
#note Seemed pretty clear-cut to play this. Defense after a fishy play and this seemed to be the best equity play too.
>Gabriel: DEM 10F ME.D +21 292
#note At this point Gabriel is trying to speed up since he already has less than 8 minutes on his clock. I feel confident that I'm going to win after this play because of board control and time control
>Josh: EGHIOOR 11E GORE +26 313
>Gabriel: D 8L .D +3 295
#note He took a while on this turn though. I was happy that he laid this down too, since it lengthens the game and he isn't going to bingo next turn.
>Josh: AAHINOZ 6L .H +5 318
#note I felt like I should play it safe here, although he could outscore after a blocking play that doesn't score. I considered M2 ZONA, sim's favorite, but I was slightly more paranoid than that and thought he could still bingo after ZONA. I guess I just should have played it.
>Gabriel: AN K1 NA +15 310
>Josh: AAINOSZ 12D ZOA +32 350
#note Awesome, he has no time left and I have the case A. What could go wrong? Sim likes ZOI(C) to set up A(ZOIC), but no way I'm confident enough to play that.
>Gabriel: DY 8L ..DY +27 337
#note I held this (lol)
>Josh: AIINSTY 13C NAY +30 380
#note Alright, here's where things start to get interesting. The Q isn't really a huge burden if either of us draw it, but I just need to ensure 2 spots for it if I draw it. That is why I thought this was a good play. It scores, keeps IS for QIS, etc. The sim also likes SAY in the same spot for some weird weird reason. I also considered the blocky TYI(Y)N, which I guess I should have played even with the fear of being outscored, as it still ensures a good spot for a Q and a good score regardless next turn. The sim prefers TYIYN handily.
>Gabriel: IP 3C PI. +19 356
#note Gabriel had less than a minute here and snap-played this. He felt stupid for emptying the bag.
>Josh: IIQRSTU B1 QIS +32 412
>Gabriel: ?CERST 7A sECTS +19 375
#note SECTaR(Y) and CuRTSE(Y) play. He went 2 minutes over on this play.
>Josh: IRTU 1B .UIRT +15 427
