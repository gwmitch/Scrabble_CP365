>Josh: DNOQSTW -DQW +0 0
#note Not eating the Q for 16 points or 24 points and blowing my S. But perhaps I should get rid of my O also. Letting go of the O gives me more points for my bingos but reduces my chance of drawing one by 5%
>Michael_Fagen: EVX 8G VEX +26 26
>Josh: ELNOSST J8 TELSONS +75 75
>Michael_Fagen: DEIORTZ H8 .ROTIZED +107 133
>Josh: AADEEOT 13H .O.ATED +36 111
#note I decided to play ZONATED quickly. I didn't want him to be able to hook his own D. Silly, he is quite unlikely to have a D. I should have taken a moment to think.
>Michael_Fagen: AFH K9 FAH +35 168
>Josh: ?ADEIRW 15A tAWDRIE. +92 203
#note I was extremely confident he would not challenge this, hence why I didn't go for the safer RAWhIDE(D). I missed sIEWAR(D) though, but this is definitely the play and a risk worth taking.
>Michael_Fagen: EILV D11 LIVE. +18 186
>Josh: EMNOOUU G11 EMO +31 234
#note Damn it, missing L10 MOU(T)ON! Not a good game for me thus far.
>Michael_Fagen: EIN I6 NI.E +21 207
>Josh: NNOSUUU -NUUU +0 234
#note MOUTON sure would have gotten me out of this. Again it was between keeping the O or not. It worked last time, so why not do it again? :)
>Michael_Fagen: EIILOT H1 IOLITE +23 230
>Josh: ADNNOQS F14 Q. +31 265
>Michael_Fagen: ABNY N10 BAN.Y +34 264
>Josh: ADENNOS O8 ANODE +31 296
>Michael_Fagen: BFIRU E7 BURFI +24 288
>Josh: AGGINOS L10 GOA. +20 316
#note First time I miss (U)N(VEXT) in F5 AGON, but that's asking for G trouble. This is the play nonetheless.
>Michael_Fagen: JNTU B11 JUNT. +24 312
>Josh: GINOSTU 3D TOUS.ING +61 377
>Michael_Fagen: RW -  +0 312
#note challenged out of desperation.
>Josh: AAEEIKM 4D AIM +20 397
#note setting up something like EEK. Rather not play at 4A if I don't have to. He obviously doesn't have the blank based on his challenge, which is when 4A usually works best.
>Michael_Fagen: RW 6F WR.. +15 327
>Josh: ?AEEKPY 2B gEEKY +64 461
#note I almost had KAPEYKA!!! Decided against making the 1/11 fish though. I guess I could play 5C EEK, but to what end? It gives me more spread sometimes and screws me in spread other times.
>Michael_Fagen: CGHLPRR 6F ....CH +20 347
#note complex endgame for Michael here. He should play D1 R(ETA)G to block my scoring plays.
>Josh: AACPSU 1A CAPS +37 498
>Michael_Fagen: GLPRR 12A P.L. +9 356
#note -6 to P(U)R(I), which I saw was his play. Also 9B GRR(R)L
>Josh: AU C12 .A +16 514
>Michael_Fagen: GRR 9C GR.R +7 363
>Michael_Fagen: GRR --  -7 356
>Josh: U K5 U. +10 524
#note oops on Michael's part. Those new 4s are tough
>Josh:  (GRR) +8 532
