#note I wanted to be aggressive here, but not so much that I'm setting letters up that I didn't have by playing FOU. But Joey doesn't really score much more after FOU, but I am much more likely to take a nice lead with IPST instead of ISTU.

#note This isn't ours.  It's not theirs either, but it should be.

Josh: I should have lost the game right then, but I was lucky Joey let this go. I was unsure of HEISTER and disliked the volatility of E11 HIREE. And this was better positionally than THEIRS so I took it. Why do I do this?
