>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILNR 8B REGINAL +70 70
#note I went 3-5 the previous day, and since I had to skip the early birds this year, I REALLY wanted to have a respectable showing. Last year I went from 9-4 to 9-12, an epic collapse that I never want to repeat. The year before that was even worse, 8-13 -797 or something like that. Not this year, not this time. Even if it means I have to beat my nemesis George Macaulay. Opening with REGINAL was a nice surprise.
>George_Macaulay: AAFNU C3 FAUNA. +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: DDOOSTY 9G YOD +24 94
#note STOD(G)Y is neat, but hard for me to see past an obvious 3 letter word play keeping the S.
>George_Macaulay: GOX 10H GOX +34 54
>Matthew_Larocque: DNORSTV E7 D.VOT +18 112
>George_Macaulay: EFI F10 FIE +29 83
>Matthew_Larocque: BLNNRRS 4A BR.N +18 130
#note Sharp downward incline.
>George_Macaulay: ITZ 11I TIZ +37 120
#note Crap I'm gonna lose aren't I
>Matthew_Larocque: ALNRSUW 12J SAWN +35 165
#note WU, really? Get out of here. Might as well take 35 points if that's how it's going to be, at least he can't hook SAWN.
>George_Macaulay: IJOS M9 JOI.S +40 160
>Matthew_Larocque: ALLOPRU 7E .UP +22 187
#note Yeah I'm going to stay away from that J, If I make it that easy for him then I'm definitely going to lose.
>George_Macaulay: CEELSU B8 .ECLUSE +30 190
#note Glad to see him blowing up his rack.
>Matthew_Larocque: AHILLOR C12 HILL +25 212
#note Again, I just couldn't use that spot. Even 35 points wouldn't tempt me.
>George_Macaulay: ADEEP 15C .EAPED +30 220
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCMORR A1 COB. +30 242
#note I knew this could be trouble later on, but George had been playing for points instead of fishing, so that made this seem a little less dangerous. I missed that CAROM scores 40 points and the C gets in the way for him. I didn't even know CARROM.
>George_Macaulay: IOV 6A VI.O +9 229
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIMMRR 14G MARM +21 263
#note Yikes. This is good in Collins, so I didn't lose my turn, but a lost turn here could have been big trouble for me.
>George_Macaulay: TU 9M .UT +10 239
#note !
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIRT O9 .IGHTER +45 308
#note With the C and F open, as well as S(PAY), I was very surprised that George opened in such a desperate manner (being down 34 points).
>George_Macaulay: IKR 15J IRK +16 255
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AANOSW N13 AW +23 331
#note I'm sitting on a nice leave so maybe I'd beat George to a bingo.
>George_Macaulay: ?ADEIRT 1A .ITRAtED +83 338
#note Nope.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENOQS H12 Qu.. +23 354
#note That Q almost broke this game. I fluked one out this time.
>George_Macaulay: EEENOTY 2D EYE +18 356
#note If he plays TONE instead which blocks AEONS, I probably blow this game by playing SONE/SPAY, which gives him enough points for EYE to beat me. And then I probably blow the whole tournament. Thankfully, that did not occur.
