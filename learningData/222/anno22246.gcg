#note I might also have challenged UNCARVED, which is actually good - cesar: I am so mad at myself because I thought it was an anagram pair, and i was pretty much 100% sure of UNCARVED, but i was also pretty damn sure it was a pair and didn't want to put the A under the 3L.
>JD: EEIILOP 4G PILO.E +18 243
#note it's not imperative for me to block CURATIVE because it doesn't score that many points, but this or PEISE look like my best options
>Cesar: ?ACERUV H1 CAV.E +30 251
>JD: DEIIJTZ 2B DE.TZI. +74 317
#note after playing PILOSE I realized he was very likely to play CAVIE for a lot of points, but then once I realized what he'd given me I reallllllly wanted him to play it
>Cesar: ??BILRU 1H .oLUBRId +89 340
#note lucky draw.
>JD: AAIIJNO 1A JIN +35 352
#note the board is very closed, so there's a huge emphasis on not opening new spots - hence why I avoided AJI or RIOJA. I really wanted to play at A1 to block easy scoring plays. There are also only 7 vowels left out of 21, so there's a decent chance of my rack getting salvaged after JIN. the alternative I didn't think of is just playing JO, which makes drawing the Q less likely, but then I have to keep AAII. 
>Cesar: AAIRTTW C4 WAI. +25 365
>JD: AAIIOQR -AAIIOQR +0 352
#note there seem to be no Q plays to draw at all except QIS, and none of my tiles do anything in particular, so I figured I should throw them all back and go for the S on row 12.
>Cesar: ACNRSTT 12A CAST +35 400
#note JD: it turned out that he had the S, but I think I have a good chance of outrunning him if he pulls the Q on this draw. cesar: I think I should keep the S and play 12D ANT. I need Q insurance. -6
>JD: AEFNOUV A12 .OVE +27 379
>Cesar: AAINORT L10 OAR +14 414
#note again, if the Q is in the bag he will lose regardless of what he plays here (although RENO at E5 would be close). cesar: I wanted to play RENO but then brainfarted. my thought here is that i'm probably only about 25% or less to draw the Q because he could have kept it with COVE maybe. i don't know.
>JD: AFIMNQU E5 M.. +20 399
#note I am supposed to block RIANT by playing MAYA (which saves REQUIN, which I missed). but I was out of time and I lose anyway.
