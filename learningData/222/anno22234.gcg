>Joey: ?DKOTTX -DKT +0 0
#note Interesting opener.  DETOX 40 is tempting, but it exhausts all my ammunition.
>Jeffrey: AEEMRSU 8D MEASURE +74 74
>Joey: ?EOOTXZ E5 OOZ. +26 26
#note Threatening a big X spot, though he might wonder why I didn't score a little more elsewhere.
>Jeffrey: DDEIO 9B DIODE +29 103
>Joey: ?AEPTXY F4 PYX +61 87
#note APTERYX was so tempting, but ?AET is so powerful, even at the cost of 34 points now.
>Jeffrey: AEILMNO B5 MELO.IAN +65 168
>Jeffrey: AEILMNO --  -65 103
>Joey: ?ABEORT K5 ABORTEd +92 179

>Joey: EEGIPTT 12A GITE +22 201
>Jeffrey: AHL 10J H.AL +28 199

#note There goes ARGUFIED.  Maybe I should start losing challenged since that seems to work for my opponents.
>Joey: ?AEFGIU G2 GIE +9 353
#note Meanwhile, I had to decide what in the world plan B was.  Didn't appear that anything would work.
>Jeffrey: INV H1 VIN +23 418
>Joey: ?AFFNTU N7 AFT +18 371
#note Forcing him to block FAUN.  That would still fall a little short.
