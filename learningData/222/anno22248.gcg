#note i feel like this kind of move is harder for humans. they might think i can take the Z spot now with ZINE or whatever, and keep at least XI for next turn.. but i think EXINE is better.. didn't think it would be 16 pts better! taking 12H XI is actually better than ZEIN/ZINE.

#note O4 YOGIC, K1 YOGI were considered, but i was in no hurry to open the board. i thought GYNIE wouldn't sim that well, but i wanted to block a little and i did think of the possibility that he'd challenge it. i don't like YOGI there or at G2 though. maybe YOGIC is the play. -8

#note the play here has gotta be DATTOS. my S isn't that important on this board, and i'm playing off some tiles, score, bring the end of the game quicker, block a high scoring lane. QAT sims very close though.
