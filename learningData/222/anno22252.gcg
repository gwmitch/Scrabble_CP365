#note I made this play in the interest of long-term board control, but I can see myself playing F4 GABY in a do-over, which in the short term is safer. It's quite unlike me to open a huge 2x2 when I don't have to. I missed GABY though.
>Glenn_Dunlop: EFH K5 FEH +36 87
>Josh: GHNSUXY J10 HUNG +29 144
#note Missed the nice fit of G1 UGH. That's the play. I liked NSXY better than SXY but I didn't want to create a nice lane with HUG over HUNG. The counterintuitive L3 GUSH looks to be a close 3rd in this race.
>Glenn_Dunlop: INOR L6 NORI +12 99
>Josh: ?EEESXY M7 YE +24 168
#note I keep missing Y(OWE). F4 SEXY is also a good play, although I prefer this.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ELNT 2J .LENT +14 113
>Josh: ?EEERSX 1N EX +29 197
#note It looked like Glenn was having a very hard time balancing his rack, so I wasn't really feeling focused here. I saw EXERGUES for 98 and actually decided not to play it as I didn't have to. I wanted to make sure I wasn't making it up. I missed EXTER(N)ES though. This is a major blunder but it's not like I was playing this game carefully.

>Josh: DEJMOOT L1 J.ED +40 317
#note I should have played JETE, didn't notice there were so many T's left. I also considered that keeping the J here was not a bad thing, and that I could play something at K11, but ultimately I decided that I was too far ahead to care

#note I always miss MIAUL. I wanted to play down column F though, since it blocks a good chunk of the board thereby preventing most bingo-bango scenarios.
