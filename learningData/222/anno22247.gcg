#note wow, I was really intending to challenge MAHZORS but eventually chickened out of it. it's good. I held for over 10 minutes. cesar: I inadvertently coffeehoused JD here by jokingly saying "it's a musical instrument!", because he chided me for fast-bagging, which was completely unintentional (it never crossed my mind that MAHZORS could be phony, although after a few seconds MAHZORIM jumped into my head). Then I felt really guilty. Sorry JD!

>Cesar: ACEJNOY 7C JOY +30 77
>JD: GIINOOR K9 GIRO +22 80
#note Q also likes OI at I10, which creates the possibility of ?OR?ING type bingos on column K (not a lot of Os left, he may not have OXO). I think my play is fine.
>Cesar: ACENNTT H7 C.TENANT +61 138
>JD: FIINOTU L4 FINITO +24 104
#note hoping to draw an S. actually in retrospect I like TUITION a lot more, because it doesn't block my lane on column L and sets up more big plays on column O. might as well make things as volatile as possible, and FINITO replaces my best lane with a significantly worse one. too bad, although in this game it was unlikely to matter.
>Cesar: ?DEIIST 15B InDITES +110 248
#note cesar: that is some luck though. I have no choice with COTENANT, but a lot of the time I'll be giving up more points than I'm scoring... not this time though. I guess my luck the last few games against JD makes up for that epic LA game :P

#note i thought i might be making HONDA up, lol. but J2 APRON is definitely best here, whoops. I should also see PARDON. gross play. -10
