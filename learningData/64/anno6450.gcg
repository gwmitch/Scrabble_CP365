#note Somewhere around here, Winter overdrew and I turned over an X and threw it back in the bag.  This made me hyper aware of the X, and made thoughts of coming back a little more feasible.

#note Wow, ISoCHOR is good without the E!  For 90, no less.  I chose a subpar bingo, obviously.  With so many choices here, it was easy to get overwhelmed, especially 'cause I'd need another one still to come back.  Or the X play.  Which is why I chose ISOCHoR(E) to set up an X spot.  Sidenote: TOTER os good, so CHOoSI(E)R would've been an option too.  2B ISoCHOR is Q's best.

#note He blocked PURLINE; this is almost as good (lucky!).
>Winter: BINORS 15A BISON +38 393
#note He said "Well, if you got it, you got it."  I don't know what Q would say, don't know what his other two letters were, but he did mention (PE)RI as a possibility.  BISON is 3rd, winning 96% (!).  BIS wins 97.5%, BOS 97.27%.
