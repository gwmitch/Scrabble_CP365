#note Hilariously missing UNQUOTE 2H 72! I forgot that was good without the D on the end. However I still got 72 points out of the Q on the next two moves. That would have probably let me break this year's records of 631, but I had no real chance at the all-time record of 665 anyway given what was left.

#note If I had played UNQUOTE, he has WERE L1 46, so I wouldn't have been able to use that area the next turn anyway. Interestingly enough, if that's what had happened he would only have two tiles left and I only end up with a score of 10 points more or so on average.
