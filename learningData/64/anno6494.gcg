#note INDICIAL#! Grrr... Not upset about letting it go, though; INDICIA and INDICIAS are ours, gut said it was good. It's usually best to go with the first instinct, but this time it was wrong. Oh well. Sisyphus goes to the bottom of the hill, part 1.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: AFILRTT 12H .RAFT +20 42
#note So much for the E to play through. Right idea, wrong tiles. (C)LIFT.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: EHMOOPU 11J MOUE +28 117
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: EIILRTT 14C LITER.TI +62 104
#note Sisyphus approaches the top of the hill, part 1.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: ?ADEHOP C7 AsPHODE. +84 201
#note This had Fiszbein, Clark, and Knapp all inquiring about what the blank was. One of those words I'd seen, but probably never would've found. Evan said afterward he almost played HEAD at 15A, which would've worked out a lot better for me. Sisyphus gets sent to the bottom of the hill, part 2.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: AAAEGRS B10 AGA +19 123
#note In hindsight, too gutsy, too panicky. Fishing off the AA for 11 in any of three spots is fine. Figured I'd see how well Evan drew.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: FNOQRWZ A12 FROW +53 254
#note Well, got my answer. Owie.

#note Evan said at this point, he was worried this would end up like our first game, me coming back from a 100+-point deficit.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: CEENOUV F10 CUVE. +16 266
#note Couldn't bring myself to play EVZONE... Debated between this and EVO(K)E for a while. VENU(E)'s another option. (K)UE (which I considered briefly but discarded, looking for turnover and an S) leads staticly.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: EEEGHRS 2B GEE. +28 314
#note I was going to spell it the right way!
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: DEEJNNO A7 JEED +44 310
#note But this was probably a better option anyway, when I remembered that -AHS hook was still open. Sisyphus nearly makes it to the top of the hill, part 2.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: EEHLQRS 15J SHEQEL +59 373
#note Evan nearly played Q(I) at J7 before seeing this. Given that I'm going to score 28 coming back, it probably comes down to a close endgame. But with this (what I called Evan's tournament-winning play) ... Sisyphus gets sent down to the bottom of the hill, part 3.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: ABNNOOT 9M BOA +28 338
#note NO WAY! (O)B(LITERATI)ON!!! That would've given me a chance, as you'll see.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: AGIRSUV K4 VAGUS +30 403
#note Can't believe a four-time MM winner would miss (TO)GAVIRUS here. Tsk tsk... ;)
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: LNNNOST O6 NON. +12 350
#note Replace my third N with the A I'd have kept after OBLITERATION, and I have SON(A)NTAL to tie the game. Given Evan's crappy rack, I win the endgame. Unreal. As for the real rack, CP says to pass LNN.

>Sneaky_Of_Verb: AIIORUY 4K .ARY +20 423
#note Only two vowels left, so the IIOU leave shouldn't be a concern. Evan needs to score, block, and not empty; this play does all three.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: DEILNST N2 ST.LED +31 381
#note "Nice style," Evan said. "Real style would've been fishing for the out bingo," I said. But, there's no way I can win after decent play from Evan, and losing by 100 would be inviting Grob to pass me on spread if he won his game, which he did. So, gave up the ghost, as painful as it was to do. Duck says SL(I)D at D12 is the better spread-saver.
>Sneaky_Of_Verb: IIMNOTU 3A NOM +21 444
#note I pointed at that fishing was pointless because Evan could likely outrun my out bingo with the 34-point OM(I)T at D12. Having missed it, he said "Why didn't you say something before?" "This is not a team effort!" I replied.
>I_Did_Jonas_Salk: INR G5 RIN. +9 390
#note Congrats to Evan, a worthy champ.
