#note Q likes 3g (MA)FIA or F2 FA.  leaving DETU or DEITU.  i went for points and hoped to beat jacob in an out in two situation.
>jacob_bergman: EEENOOT M5 T.EE +5 355
#note jacob said he was trying to block plays like FOOTS.
>jc: FIOOSTV 3G ..FIOSO +32 358
#note i saw 3g (MA)FIOSO and that that would leave c15 V(E)T as my out.  i wasnt sure if i should sneakily play V(E)T for 6 and hope he didnt see MAFIOSO, or played a suboptimal play that didnt get him the win.    in retrospect, i think i should have tried playing it that way round.
