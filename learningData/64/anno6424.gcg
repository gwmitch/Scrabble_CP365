#note first of all, I6 GUID uses the same 4 letters but scores more and doesn't necessarily create volatility. however the highest simming plays are G8 UH  and G7 DUH. to be perfectly honest, i don't think my play is that terrible; if only it didn't put the U there i think it would sim ok. i try to keep better leaves in the beginning of games, so i don't know why quackle loves UH and DUH so much, must be the points plus IING isn't that bad here. -12
>Lewis: OW I8 OW +20 28
>Cesar: BEHINNY 7I HINNY +32 46
#note this is one of my worst characteristics at play here, i don't bother to look much harder because this already scores enough, what else could i have? (plus i spent too much time on the first play). bad job. -6.5 (J6)
>Lewis: II -II +0 28
>Cesar: BBCEOPX 12B BEBOP +29 75
#note i have an abnormal love for this word, but COBBY is better. i forgot that was a word. -1.5
>Lewis: AKS 6I SKA +45 73
>Cesar: CMNNORX 13A COX +46 121
>Lewis: AE 8L AE +11 84
>Cesar: FLMNNPR -FLMNP +0 121
#note dammit that's an obnoxious draw. quackle likes PRAWN through AW; i thought it was wiser to just exchange and see some new tiles.  -5.5
>Lewis: GI A13 .IG +18 102
>Cesar: AILNOPQ 10D LAP +28 149
#note quackle told me that i drew ADEINRT. no, quackle, i'm not that lucky in important games. ARGH. NAP is better because of the QI setup, i'm not that clever. PION at 5K also sims best, maybe cuz of the same thing (and some shot at tranq? i dunno). does anyone see themselves playing PION? -9.5
>Lewis: AA D12 .AA +18 120
>Cesar: INOQRRV -OQRV +0 149
#note VINO 5K? no quackle, would you stop that? really?  -13
>Lewis: EILOSTU C4 OUTLIES +65 185
>Cesar: DEIMMNR 8A IM.DE +30 179
#note maybe 5K is the meaning of life. it seems as if every play possible is best there. actually, in this case D1 MIND may be best, which i considered. or 5K MIM? -2
>Lewis: AEFILST F2 FETIALS +79 264
#note oh come on. at least i didn't play MIND.
>Cesar: EEIMNNR J6 ..NE +17 196
#note 5K MEN. 5K AGAIN, DAMN IT. why did i hate that spot so much? -4
>Lewis: ETWY D1 WYTE +32 296
>Cesar: AEHIMNR 9L EH +25 221
#note this is pretty lame. i think i was low on time.  HERMA B2 is nice. -8 it's amusing that quackle likes 9M HE better. i must really be in deep trouble.
>Lewis: CDR 5A CR.D +19 315
>Cesar: AEIMNOR A1 AMNI. +30 251
#note these draws are annoying. maybe MEOW.
>Lewis: ?DNOORT 12H TORNaDO +75 390
#note this is unfair dammit
>Cesar: EEOORTU B2 OE +14 265
#note ROE. why roe? the details window doesn't make sense except that post-ROE stdev is slightly higher. -3

#note i dunno what lewis saw unseen, but i coulda had something like EVERmORE.. maybe he just has to play two. FROZE is better than my play. -15
>Lewis: ERRVV 2K VERV. +22 460
#note i also mistracked and thought he had no vowels. doh.
