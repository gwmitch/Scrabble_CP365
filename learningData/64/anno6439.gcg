#note this word looked funny, but it has to be a word, right? it was either this or DUDE(S). i didn't want to give up some easy X overlap , but I promise turnover wasn't a consideration!
>David: ?AFOORT D11 OF +22 110
>Cesar: AADGINZ 14I DAZING +46 114
#note blah. i like being aggressive. nothing wrong with my play, J8 ADZ kind of bothers me. (especially after OF i feel i need to take charge and score) -3
>David: ?AEIORT 11D ..ATORIEs +66 176
>Cesar: AAEILNY 12K LINEY +28 142
#note i don't like the idea of doing 12G AY. but in this case i need to agree with quackle because LINEY doesn't really make it more open for a bingo -- it gives back pts and keeps a bad leave.  -8
>David: CEEIJUX O8 JUIC. +51 227
#note ok fine i give up

#note quackle prefers just droping the H at 10F.... why. -1.5
>David: EEIMTT 6H MITT +19 271
>Cesar: AACDLPS K2 CLAP. +18 211
#note i wanted to do PACT at 14B but without an E and knowing he's not gonna miss that hook or at least take the spot, that play is useless. PASCAL at L4 sims best. -5
>David: EEEOPRS L3 ORE +16 287
>Cesar: ADGRSTT 13B DAT. +16 227
#note i was expecting this to sim rather badly, but quackle's top suggestions don't exactly win me over. M1 DAGS/TAGS? what? D4 TARDY? i guess i'm in a crap situation either way. -6.5
>David: EEEMPSW B10 WEE.S +34 321
>Cesar: EGINRST 5K ..G +6 233
#note ok now where do i put my bingo. lipe, is there anything i could have done earlier to make this game more open? i do stuff like DAZING and LINEY and BAN and it doesn't work. M3 GEN doesn't really do anything except score, but PEG is even worse, i'd need a goldilocks bingo there. so GEN has to be better, 24 and i keep hope slightly alive. -5.5
>David: EGMOPRS A8 PROM +33 354
>Cesar: EIINRST 14B .I +4 237
#note K9 RIEL actually gives me a higher bingoing chance and scores more. -9.5
>David: BEGIOSV B6 VOE +18 372

#note 2I LECTIN seems to be somewhat creative, but i don't have a realistic shot anymore. -17
