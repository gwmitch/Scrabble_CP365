>eb94: ADLNPTT 8D PLANT +20 20
#note Plant was the best play. Yippee! (Yippee is valid, by the way) I decided to annotate this as my first game because it was the first game in which I really analyzed the end game to try to trap my opponent. The beginning is sort of weak on my part, but whatever. By the way, I know LEN* is no good.
>wesmo: ADDEEIU 9F DUI +13 13
#note U(N)IDEAED was best.
>eb94: DKLPSTT -DKLPT +0 20
#note I7 PST was best, my exchange was fourteenth best. Lame.
>wesmo: ?ADEEEI 10E ED +16 29
#note ED wasn't even listed. PEE was best.
>eb94: AELRSTW 11C WAT +16 36
#note 11C Warstle, I6 Wastrel, I5 Wrastle, I5 WARSTLE. all 71-74% Win. Matt Canik's reallly mad.
>wesmo: ?AEEIOO -EIOO +0 29
#note Quackle likes OE 12C. Change EIOO is fourth.
>eb94: EELNNRS 12B LEN +15 51
>eb94: EELNNRS --  -15 36
#note That was so dumb.
>wesmo: ?AEIIOR 9C AI +7 36
#note 12C OI is best. AI was weak, but still third.
>eb94: EELNNRS 10H ERN +8 44
#note WREN C11 is the best play, but I don't like leaving the triple open like that. Sure I have an S, but there are still three esses out. Ern 10H was the last play on the list with 50.39% Winning. ELNS is an okay leave.
>wesmo: ?CEIIOR 12C OI +13 49
#note Wesmo played OI in the spot that was suggested last turn. It's still the best non-bingo though with 67% win versus 72.30% for the top bingo, OnEIRIC K8. The other bingos are ORIfICE K4, RECIsIO(N) J3, cICERO(N)I J4, CIcERO(N)I J4, sORICI(N)E J4, and pECORI(N)I J4;
>eb94: EFLNRST K9 FELT +18 62
#note FELT 13B was the better FELT, coming in at number 2. WOLF C11 was better. WOLF does take an s, by the way, like WOLFING down food.
>wesmo: ?ACEIRT 13A CATtIER +82 131
#note Nice one, Wesmo. ERoTICA 13c was best, CATtIER came in at 13th.
>eb94: FNNORSY -  +0 62
#note CATTIER. I've seen that word! WHY DID I CHALLENGE?!?!?!
>wesmo: DGINRWX A13 .IG +18 149
#note F12 DEX was best, but CIG was fourth. CIG still is 82% win as opposed to 85.71% for DEX.
>eb94: FNNORSY 12H FOR.Y +30 92
#note FOR(T)Y is the best play! Another classic top 200 five (?). Always nice getting a double-double. Should have played it last turn, where it would have been number one again. It's only 14.41 percent win though... This is looking grim for Ted.
>wesmo: CDNORWX B7 CORN +11 160
#note Corn was okay. Seventh best. DEX, EX, and REX were still the best like last turn.
>eb94: ?EHKNNS 14F HEN +29 121
#note HEN 14F was best play. That makes three. Now my win percentage is up to 35.96%! YAY!
>wesmo: DEOTUWX 15G DEX +43 203
#note DEX was 6th best. TUXEDO 15G was the best, but that was a crazy find. XU was next best on the triple, and then TUX, DOUX, DETOX all in the same spot. Now the Win % is up to 81.82%. TUXEDO gave 89.32%.
>eb94: ?AHIKNS 6B SHAKINg +76 197
#note I saw HANKIeS and SHAKINg, but not HANKIes, Fe, and ERNES, which Matt saw (L4). Dumb on my part. HANKIeS L4 is the best play. SHAKINg 6B was second best, and now my win percentage is up to 33.82. It would have been 40.82% if I played HANKIeS L4.
>wesmo: DEEOTUW E3 WEE. +22 225
#note WEEK E3 was fifth. OWE 13L is the best. It can be extended with the D that Wesmo holds.
>eb94: AAMNOSU D1 MOAN +27 224
#note MOAN D1 is number one!
>wesmo: DILOTUZ 1D .OULD +24 249
#note MOULD is number 4. OLD C1 is the best. Shuts down the triple sufficiently and scores pretty well. MODULI was the better play in terms of utilizing the triple, coming in at second. OLD had a 62.73% win, MOULD had 58.06% Just to point out a cool move: T(R)O(O)Z I9 for 31, though it was only 53.60% win.
>eb94: AEJMSSU C3 MAS. +37 261
#note C3 MAS(H) is best play.
>wesmo: EEIPTVZ 2F PIE +26 275
#note VIE L7 was the best, despite only scoring 12 points, leaving 56.30% win. PIE was 4th, rendering 50.89% win. GAMECHANGER! GETTING INTENSE!
>eb94: EJLSTUV 8A J. +27 288
#note Didn't see anything, so I played JO 8A. Turns out it was the best play, giving me 59.12% winning as opposed to the next best play, (R)EV J12, which only gives 49.65% winning. So basically, this changes the game to my advantage. Crazy stuff.
>wesmo: EGQTUVZ J8 TE. +8 283
#note TEN wasn't even rated on there. Best play was G(ANE)V 4B and then (N)E(R)TZ J10, both 46.67 and 45.45% respectively. The lowest on there is 32.58%, so TEN puts Wesmo 32% or below. This was a hard play, but a key one.
>eb94: ELRSTUV L6 VERT +14 302
#note LUV 3H was best at 79.55%. VERT doesn't even rank, so it is 68% or below.
>wesmo: BGIQUVZ 7K V.G +9 292
#note Best is change BGIQVZ at 36%. Top 10 are all exchange. If wesmo made a non-exchanging move, it would still only give him 23.9% win. VEG gives 21.97%.
>eb94: AEGLOSU N1 ALGEOUS +78 380
#note GAOL 5J was the best, but phonies work too. I was so concerned with throwing down ALGEOUS* that I didn't notice VEGS*. Meh.

>wesmo: BIQRUYZ 1L QU.Y +78 370
#note QUAY is number one! Nice play, Wesmo! Still, Wesmo has no chance of winning according to Quackle. I thought he did, so I thought out my nice endgame.
>eb94: ABIOOS M3 AB +18 398
#note AB didn't render a win. So, actually, my endgame sucked.
>wesmo: BIRZ H4 ZI. +21 391
#note BRAG 3K was number one. I saw ZIG H4 and BIZE K4 as two high plays, so I went to stop one. 
>eb94: IOOS L1 .IS +16 414
#note Shutting down the only out, BRAG, I played QIS L1.
>wesmo: BR 4B B... +6 397
>eb94: OO 4H .OO +12 426
#note Lots of outs.
>eb94:  (R) +2 428
#note Good game, Wesmo.
