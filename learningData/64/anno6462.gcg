#note i don't really like blocking as many lanes as 7F MAKO does, but it seems there are a lot of better plays than FORAM. FORK, for example is an improvement (but it doesn't feel right to do that either). -5

#note quackle likes 7I HOD a lot more. the leave sure is better and it scores more. i probably shouldn't be that worried about this spot. -10.5

#note it really seems as if this is the only move that makes sense. but it is nervewracking to think of things such as quayside and dasyures. it sims so much better than G6 AALII that i can't NOT take it, right?

>Cesar: ADHILOV B10 VIOLA +40 436
#note ok i should probably take HYOIDAL/HYALOID to keep the chances of a disaster down but i didn't think of it. there are probably a few triple-triples possible, but i don't see any. VIOLA still sims best.
