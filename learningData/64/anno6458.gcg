>Evans_Clinchy: AEHILNU 8H UH +10 10
#note I'm simming four options here -- UH, aggressive INHAUL at 8H, safer INHAUL at 8D, and exchanging the U. UH looks like the best play, but it's debatable.
>Joel_Sherman: AAEGKOS 9H SOAKAGE +73 73
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEIILN 10J DIE +23 33
#note This looks right. DIAL, DEIL and NAIL all score a little more, but I didn't want the vowellier leaves.
>Joel_Sherman: OOSW O6 WOOS +34 107
>Evans_Clinchy: AHILNNV M3 HALVIN. +30 63
#note This cleans things up nicely.
>Joel_Sherman: ?AALOOP 5F APOLOgA. +68 175
#note The only bingo, and an awesome find.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEINNZ H1 DIAZ. +75 138
#note Luckbox.
>Joel_Sherman: EGLLNNO 3B NONLEG.L +74 249
#note Uh oh, here we go.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEINNQ N2 QI +27 165
#note This seemed like the best spot to dump the Q, in terms of leaving lanes open for later.
>Joel_Sherman: EIMR O1 RIME +40 289
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEEENN 1A uNNEEDE. +80 245
#note The second-lowest probability eight of the game.
>Joel_Sherman: FITTU C3 .UTFIT +10 299
#note Wonder what he kept here. Maybe ET?
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDJNVY 6E BY +28 273
#note Gotta keep scoring to have a chance.
>Joel_Sherman: EETU 8A TU.EE +18 317
>Evans_Clinchy: ADJNORV J4 D.JO +28 301
#note This cleans things up and gives me at least a slight chance. It's either this or RADON 11G, which fishes for AJIVA. I doubt that'd work.
>Joel_Sherman: CEORSTU 11D CROUTES +72 389
>Evans_Clinchy: ANRRVWX 7I W.N +23 324
#note Maybe I should just play VOX F10 now. I guess I was just hoping a better X spot would magically appear.
>Joel_Sherman: AACFIRT A6 AR.IFACT +66 455
>Evans_Clinchy: AGMRRVX F10 V.X +21 345
#note OK, now I'll play it...
>Joel_Sherman: IPSY H11 .IPSY +33 488
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGMRRT 14H .MARTER +22 367
#note GRATERS is better since it blocks his outs. I was too lazy to figure that out.
>Joel_Sherman: BEIR 13A .RIBE +14 502
>Joel_Sherman:  (G) +4 506
