#note Quackle gives B12 FAT the wpct at 68.64%, but this is a heads up move, and lead in valuation with not many vowels unseen.
>Jeremy: AEIMNVW B12 VAW +28 429
#note Quackle likes this.
>Doug: AABCETY A13 CAY +36 455
#note wpct is A13 CAB with 80.56% to win.  Doug's move is 75% to win.  The valuation play is L9 BETA.  -1.1
>Jeremy: EIJMNOS N6 JOIN +34 463
#note Quackle says five moves, including my own, win 100 percent.  This or 7I J(E)ON are the best, blocking Doug's out L4 BARTER.  I had considered L4 JIMSON* as another course of action, but just JIMSONWEED is good - I wasn't sure.
>Doug: ABERRT D2 BAR. +27 482
#note Big Now!!!  BARR* is phony, and I have just over a minute to think about it.  It is pretty brave challenging Doug knowing I can still walk out with a tie!  I put the play on hold.  This really put me in a bind.  I thought Doug would play BEAM at L11 giving me a win.  My preplanned course of action (15F SEEM) results in a tie now.  Doug probably knows his words better than me, and if I can tie I feel like taking it rather than risking a challenge which loses the game.  Instead of spending my last minute looking for a better play, I end up checking my math three times to make sure it actually tied the game.  
>Jeremy: EMS 15F SE.M +13 476
#note I11 MES(H) for 19 pts wins. I didn't spot it, and neither did Doug.  Despite the endgame mistakes, it was still an exciting game.   STEE!  Still, I was pretty happy just to get a tie against Doug.  There were only slots for Winners and Losers on the result slip. We weren't sure who should hand it in, so we co-handed the result slip to Tim together.  What a crazy game!
