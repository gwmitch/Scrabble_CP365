>Evans_Clinchy: AFGOQUX 8F QUAG +28 28
#note This is better than GOX or FOX, but it's probably better to place it at 8G than 8F, for X setup purposes.
>Rod_MacNeil: EEO I7 O.EE +7 7
>Evans_Clinchy: FIIOORX J10 XI +50 78
#note So lucky.
>Rod_MacNeil: ?AAEMNT J1 gATEMAN +64 71
>Evans_Clinchy: BFIOORU K4 FOB +33 111
#note I think this is one of those times where I overreact to a bingo and try too hard to take points. FUGIO is fine. IORU is pretty terrible.
>Rod_MacNeil: EKPSY 12H PESKY +44 115
>Evans_Clinchy: AFIORTU L4 FRO +40 151
#note I almost just went for the balanced leave and played POUF, but then I decided keeping AITU might not be that bad, and took the points.
>Rod_MacNeil: EEINR H10 RE.INE +34 149
>Evans_Clinchy: AAIIRTU F8 .UAI +15 166
#note Gotta dump vowels.
>Rod_MacNeil: ACGIM E10 MAGIC +28 177
>Evans_Clinchy: AAILNRT D8 TIARA +26 192
#note Why am I taking the points every single turn like this? Quackle would like to remind me that AINRT is a very strong leave, especially when there's an open G and E to bingo through. This does score a lot more than AL D12 though...
>Rod_MacNeil: DLNOT 2I D.LTON +14 191
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EILNST 15A eNLISTE. +85 277
#note One of only two eight-letter words in TWL that end in -STEE (ARRESTEE being the other).
>Rod_MacNeil: EEJ 1M JEE +41 232
>Evans_Clinchy: LNNOSTW M1 ..WS +38 315
#note I was happy I had a way to score without opening any counterplays. This works out great for me.
>Rod_MacNeil: HOP 8A PHO. +27 259
>Evans_Clinchy: CLNNOTU B7 C.ON +11 326
#note This is insanely defensive. I don't normally play like this.
>Rod_MacNeil: AEIRV 1F RIVA.E +29 288
>Evans_Clinchy: ALNTUWY F1 .UNWAY +22 348
#note I didn't wanna get smacked with an -ED bingo in line 2. This forces him to fit an eight in a very specific spot if he wants to bingo.
>Rod_MacNeil: DLO 13L OLD +13 301
#note This makes things interesting...
>Evans_Clinchy: BDEELRT 14N ED +12 360
#note Quackle suggests BREWED 4C, which empties the bag. If he bingos out with OUTRIGS or VIROIDS or something, I'd feel pretty stupid. This play is unorthodox, but I figured it would block bingo lanes and restrict scoring counterplays. (There's nothing in the pool for him to fit a word in that TWS spot.)
>Rod_MacNeil: D L12 ..D +7 308
#note Ooh. Rod manages to leave two in the bag and set up his H.
>Evans_Clinchy: BEILRST 5E B. +8 368
#note Just blocking ZA for spread purposes and leaving a tile in the bag. Wasn't really afraid of him bingoing at this point.
>Rod_MacNeil: Z 12C Z.. +13 321
>Evans_Clinchy: EILORST 15M OLE +22 390
#note Terrible. ISTLE is obviously way better.
>Rod_MacNeil: GHIRTUV 3C THI.G +22 343
>Evans_Clinchy: IRST M6 STIR +12 402
#note I think I was too distracted by the french fries I was eating to notice he had given me a higher-scoring outplay. Oops.
