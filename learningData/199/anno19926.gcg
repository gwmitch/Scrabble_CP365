>Matthew_Larocque: BEEFIOW 8G WOE +12 12
#note WIFE must be better, despite having more hooks. I played WOE pretty fast hoping to score with the F next turn. WIFE wasn't even looked at, but Q says there's about 10 points of difference in equity.
>Randall_Thomas: CINO 9E ICON +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: BEFIQS J6 QIS +39 51
#note Retains the F for a possible play next turn.
>Randall_Thomas: AEENOUZ 6J .UEAN +16 31
#note He later said he didn't have an S, he was just getting rid of vowels.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEFLMY M3 BEL.Y +28 79
#note BEEF(I)LY! Aside from that, I missed L4 BE(E)FY 34. I'm pretty sure I saw FE(E)BLY and wasn't sure if it was good. BEL(A)Y ranks farther down, but I thought FM seemed like the best two high pointers to keep.
>Randall_Thomas: ABEOUZ 4L B.AU +14 45
>Matthew_Larocque: EFFLMNT 7I F.TL. +28 107
#note Saw MINTY in the same spot at first, but thankfully I saw this after. Q prefers M(I)FF, but I'll stick with this.
>Randall_Thomas: EOOSZ 8A OOZES +47 92
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFLMNO B6 FL.OD +21 128
#note Trying to keep the board messy.
>Randall_Thomas: AEINRV A1 RAVINE +35 127
#note Randall getting it open again in a hurry.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHMNSY O6 SHY +42 170
#note Decided I liked this better than SHAY - harder to play downwards from the Y. I missed two awesome plays: YAM(U)NS 48 (didn't know it) and MES(SI)AH (Even if I was looking for a play like that it, would be tricky).
>Randall_Thomas: GMU N8 MUG +17 144
>Matthew_Larocque: AEMNNOP 10G POEM +25 195
#note Mostly takes out two S hooks on each side. Once again I miss 2x2 plays PENSION and MANSION.
>Randall_Thomas: ALRRU 11I RURAL +16 160
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AJNNRS L9 JN.NA +24 219
#note A fortunate draw - especially after Randall's amount of turnover.
>Randall_Thomas: IRTW C3 WRIT +20 180
>Matthew_Larocque: ??AEGIS 14I GAsSIEr +79 298
#note Ridiculous. I first put down AeGISEs 83, but that was beyond foolish. Then changed to GlAIvES, but that only scored 73. Then this, which scores pretty well and puts the G where it will be a pain in the butt for Randall. cEASInG does this better. And of course, there is a 9 letter bingo through SI for 82.
>Randall_Thomas: HRT O1 THR. +21 201
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEKOT O12 KO.E +36 334
#note KORA instead? 2x2 COESITE.
>Randall_Thomas: DOPR 15G PROD +27 228
>Matthew_Larocque: AAACEET 13E ACETA +14 348
#note CATE(N)A is amazing, I wish I had seen that beautiful play.
>Randall_Thomas: DG M13 D.G +16 244
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINTX B1 EX +38 386
#note XENIA 12A nets 5 extra spread.
>Randall_Thomas: DEIIITV 14A IVIED +21 265
