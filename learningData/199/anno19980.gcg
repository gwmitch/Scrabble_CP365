#note Quackle wants me to play this at J1, but I'm not sure I understand why. Playing the bingo at J1 will rip the board open and create a triple-triple opportunity through the E. I felt safer playing at I13, which opens a less dangerous triple-triple through the N. Is it that I am so far behind that I need to make a more volatile play to create as many comeback bingo lanes as possible? I do see that J1 will create more playable lanes than I13. Guess I was too risk adverse here.

#note Ugh, I missed ENUF at L8 play, which the clear choice. And I'm pretty sure Dustin had just texted me a joke about ENUF earlier that day. For some reason, I thought it was good in the new OWL only.

#note Okay, I am very confused here because if I Ask Championship Player to sim this move, it returns different choices every time I run the sim. What's that about?

Quackle's preferred move is exchange FGIINV, leaving C. I know the rack isn't beautiful, but why keep the C? Is there a C hook I'm missing somewhere? Is it because Quackle thinks C's are great for bingoing? Why throw back the N when there is still an open lane down J1 to make (PAW)N?

#note Quackle wanted me to play VIN(I)C here, which I did not know. The problem I see with both VIN(I)C and my play of V(I)G is the board is tight and I need to bingo to win. This and VIN(I)C shut down the board futher. Quackle's other choices are exchanging DGV or DGTV, which I think I prefer over my V(I)G play.

#note *sniff* nowhere to play INCITED.

Quackle wanted me to play DIN or TIN here. I considered this, but thought it was better to hold the consonants, thinking I would have a better chance of hitting a placeable bingo if I could put D or T on top. That was a bad decision...

#note ... ouch. That's what I get for leaving that so open.
>Jennifer: CDEIITZ H4 Z. +21 355
#note Quackle prefers DEI(C)TIC or TI(C)CED here through the C in COLLARS. I guess Quackle has given up all hope that I could bingo?

Of the Z plays, Quackle prefers Z(A) at J11 for 10 fewer points. I don't understand why. Is it so that I can play something from H1 next turn, like DICT(A)?
