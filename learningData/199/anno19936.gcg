#note If I'd known LEVE#, then any of the many double-doubles here would've gone down for sure. Only a three point loss on my end but...
>Evan_Berofsky: ?CDEFFO E5 COFFlED +121 140
#note ...a whole lot of points gained for him. Ouch.
>Jesse_Matthews: EEHRRWY F6 WY. +38 136
#note Decided on this over F4 WHY. Keeping the H to score some easy points next turn since I'm down is going to be necessary.

#note Not really any particularly awesome candidate here. The duck suggests 5I CURIA 14 is best, but I really don't like leaving the i underneath the DWS. B, H and M plays cash in on it reasonably well, and in the worst case scenario a Q play does also. I have enough consonants to play through next turn, so I don't mind leaving AE rather than AER on my rack. Seems like a worthy tradeoff to avoid giving him an easy scoring option.

#note I'm not in a great position here, so I need to create volatility. Quackle hates my idea, preferring 15J PELOID# or POLLED for 27. The LN leave on PELOID# doesn't look ideal, and the IN leave on POLLED is easily ruined by drawing just one i (not unlikely given that there are 5 in the pool still). 13A POLK# and 8K AMIDO both seem like decent options, but neither offer particularly tantalizing bingo opportunities. I'm open to hearing ideas on what you think works here. I think I like POLK# if I had to pick a play other than my own.
>Evan_Berofsky: GPRT 2J GR.PT +24 334
>Jesse_Matthews: AEHNNST 1F HENNA +27 282
#note The only other option I see as worth considering is 14K HEN, but I need points and volatility. HENNA it is.
>Evan_Berofsky: ADIIO 2B OIDIA +23 357
>Jesse_Matthews: BGNSSTU N10 BUGS +20 302
#note This play accomplishes exactly what I need to do here: scores some, opens an immediate lane that he'll have to block, and leaves an ideal NST while drawing from a vowel-heavy pool. It's worth noting I could've maximized on volatility and played 14A GUBS# for 26, but I'm scared of potential plays like METERAGE coming from him. I've also already got two lanes for 8s, and it seems most reasonable to try to create a lane for 7s. Either way there's a decent chance of him bingoing - he has just played OIDIA in that particular spot, so it seems likely that he has at least one vowel on his rack (probably an E) and a consonant that goes well with it (either R or T). If his rack leave were truly awful, I would expect him to play OIDIA at 3F instead. He doesn't need the extra points if he's got crap to deal with, he'd need a closed board instead. I have to try something though, and this is what I chose to try.
>Evan_Berofsky: EEOV O7 EVOE +25 382
#note Fortunately for me, he must've drawn the V after his last play. It's a great blocking tile in general, but all he has to do is play anything over there to close up the lane and his winning chances are sky high.
>Jesse_Matthews: AENRSTU B2 .UTEARNS +60 362
#note So there are several things for me to worry about here. If I bingo, the possibility of him having JAI at A6 is enough to seal an endgame victory for him. If I don't bingo, I need to do something either in Row 1 or Row 3 to prevent him from possibly playing 1A JIG, which is also enough to outrun any last minute bingo from me. I then also need to create a scoring opportunity for myself next turn that he will have to deal with. Quackle suggests that 3B UN does all of these things. Even after all of that, the only way that I can win is to not draw the J on my next play, and for him to not already have the J on his rack. After he makes some kind of play stopping a bingo from happening down Column A, I bingo out on Row 15 using the N with something like STRAITEN and catch him with the J and other tiles, overtaking him at the end. It's a long shot, but very cool that we can figure out exactly why Quackle suggests a seemingly odd play like UN. As it stands, I drew the J after my play and as such winning was not going to happen.
>Evan_Berofsky: AGIIOTT 15J GA.IOT +21 403
>Jesse_Matthews: EIJM F1 ..JI +14 376
#note 6A JAM is better by two points. Two points less scored on this turn, but gives up two points less after he goes out next turn.
