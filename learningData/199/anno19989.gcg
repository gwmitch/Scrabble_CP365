#note And.. Yes quackle suggest F10 HOG best.. HISTOGEN just simply too risky, eventhough it was the only bingo
>Harryadi_Hermanto: ?EISZ 15D ZInES +108 144
#note ZEINS was far safer. This is why rushing play never a wise strategy.

#note To be honest this is not even in top ten quackle. However I guess Harryadi didn't know DRACO or DRACK. I guessed it right, however he was the one who got all hooks

#note Just hope to draw I.. Which is hard, but if it happened, and also with some luck he play in other spot it will end his hope to win this game quickly (UMIAQ B2 for 72)

#note Spent too much time here. Quackle generate best mobe B1 QUA for 34. However I noticed the decisive square was N10 triple letter score. Sure it BLOCKABLE, but cannot stop the high scoring spot with X. Remember one tips? You don't always have to block. Since there are no v, or even C left. Placing X in that spot will immediately open triple word line. That why my strategy, keep QUA. But I don't claim this is the best strategy, but I just guessed the next move
