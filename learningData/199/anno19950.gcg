#note An unfortunate phony from Phil.  The general standard for whether an -ING word takes the -S is if the gerund is listed independently in the dictionary as a noun.  This would seem to have a reasonable chance, since we often use mauling as a noun in ordinary speech.  However, it was high probability enough that I was pretty certain I would have seen it before if it had been good.
>Dave_Koenig: EIKNORV L1 OVERKIN. +84 156
#note I could be wrong, but I think this is the first time I've ever bingoed* with all of the letters of my sirname#.  I chose it over REVOKING simply because the O is a less useful letter in the triple-triple lane than the R.  I suppose if I'd thought about it more, I could have reasoned that REVOKING is better, since he is about to bingo elsewhere, giving me first crack at the triple-triple lane.
>Phil_Robertshaw: AGILMSU F6 GA.LIUMS +67 67
>Dave_Koenig: EOOOPRT 11E O.TROPE +36 192
#note Not a bad play at all, but I should have thought of the alternate spelling OUTROOP#, which I was familiar with.  However, I was unjustly rewarded for my second-best play.
>Phil_Robertshaw: ?ABEFTU 12I BEAUFeT +84 151
>Dave_Koenig: ?CEHIIO O8 bIOE.HIC +158 350
#note I didn't think of the higher probability triple-triple EOLITHIC, which is probably a bit better, just so as not to open the big J/Z spot at N10.  But this is still pretty good.
>Phil_Robertshaw: AEENRSS 1H SEAS.NER +122 273
#note I've never had a game where both players triple-tripled before, let alone on back-to-back turns.
>Dave_Koenig: AADINRV 2J DI.AN +41 391
#note This was looking like one of those crazy nonstop bingo games, but unfortunately my bingo VIRANDA# was orphaned on this board.  I spent a short while looking for other bingos, but fortunately it did not distract me from finding the best play.
>Phil_Robertshaw: IQ 7J QI. +25 298
#note Better to play it here rather than at K6 in order to keep the extra bingo lane open on row 5.  If he had been ahead, the reverse would have been true.
>Dave_Koenig: AAFRVYZ M9 ZAF.AR +62 453
#note I actually saw this best play pretty quickly, but I spent a while hesitating, because I couldn't remember for sure if it was good.  Clearly a sign of rust on my part, because all of the spellings of this are good in TWL, and on reflection I knew them all cold a few years ago.  Alas, memory is fickle.  They are ZAFFAR, ZAFFER, ZAFFIR, and ZAFFRE.

#note At a score like this, it is important to be practical rather than always focusing on maximizing equity.  I have various plays that score better and play fewer tiles, but by playing one of them I would prolong the game and giving him better chances to come back.  Also, I can play the exact same tiles for a better score at 13A making YOUTHS, when the Y in sixth position is not exactly a dangerous tile for triple-triples.  However, when another triple-triple is one of the only ways he can get back into the game, there is no reason to take such a risk.

#note After starting with the phony, Phil has scored over 400 points in the next seven turns, but he is still out of striking distance.  Just one of those games.
>Dave_Koenig: BCDEMRT 7D CR.B +18 532
#note Plays such as BAM or CAB keeping the R definitely make this a stronger leave, and I would play that way if I were trailing.  But with the lead, I'd again rather turn over the extra tile, plus I'd like to beat him to the S for ZAFFARS if possible.
>Phil_Robertshaw: ELTW 13B WELT. +16 421
#note Ha!  If he hadn't gone there, I would have had MORTISED and a 600 point game, though I definitely would have looked carefully before playing it to see if he could have had a triple-triple response and if it would have beaten me.  Only if the triple-triple would beat me would I have forgone the bingo.

>Phil_Robertshaw: INO (challenge) +5 453
#note Yes, I challenged ZAFFARS, since I wasn't sure of it when I played it.  This is not the only time in this tournament that I unsuccessfully challenged an S hook of my own word.

#note This game's combined 1051 points tied it for the fifth highest scoring game of the 2014 World Championship.
