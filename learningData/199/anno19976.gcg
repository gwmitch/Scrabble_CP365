>Matthew_Larocque: DGORRRT 8G TORR +8 8
#note Wasn't 100% on DORR, Quackle likes 8F GROT or exchange keeping RT. I thought for some reason that TORR didn't take an S.
>Eric_Tran: CDEJLOT 7C JOLTED +29 29
>Matthew_Larocque: DDGIRSV D4 VIG.R +20 28
>Eric_Tran: ACEHIOT 6H ACHIOTE +76 105
>Matthew_Larocque: DDDELSU N1 DELUD.D +20 48
#note Now would have been a good time to know SUDD. Quackle really doesn't like my play. J8 (R)UDD is the runner-up. I didn't know RUDD either, but it's only 10 points. I have an S for ACHIOTE, so I liked creating another high scoring spot and getting turnover.
>Eric_Tran: AAEGNSW 1L WA.E +36 141
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIPSTU 5J UP +21 69
#note UPSI(D)E is neat. Quackle agrees with the fish, but I'm falling far behind so I have to hit something next turn.
>Eric_Tran: AAGNOSS 8A AGO.A +29 170
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEINST C7 ..B +15 84
#note Didn't know OBEISANT. Couldn't come up with INSTABLE, which I needed to find here.
>Eric_Tran: ENNOSSU O4 NOSES +40 210
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINSTZ B8 .AZE +38 122
#note Paying for my mistake.
>Eric_Tran: EEMNRTU A11 RUMEN +26 236
>Matthew_Larocque: CIILNST 11A ..LICT +16 138
#note Preferred adding the T, because I cannot hook onto the C.
>Eric_Tran: AEFIMOT L1 .AIF +20 256
>Matthew_Larocque: FINS 12C IF +22 160
#note Didn't get the rack. 
>Eric_Tran: ELMNOTV 5A VOM.T +20 276
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENPRSS 13D SNiPERS +68 228
#note Wasn't sure on TORRS. 2G PRISt(A)N(E)S!
>Eric_Tran: AEILNOR 10F AILERON +65 341
>Matthew_Larocque: BEIIKNT 3I TIK. +9 237
#note It's too late for nonsense like this, I should just take the points.  KININ and KINETIN are words I did not know.
>Eric_Tran: ?AEGNOX 11I hEXAGON +101 442
#note Pfft, I don't need your puny X hotspot! Or so Eric must have been thinking.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIINY 10N YA +28 265
#note After I hit the clock, I noticed BYE fit for 41, leaving INIA. That's disheartening.
>Eric_Tran: EHQUWY J2 Q. +31 473
>Matthew_Larocque: BEIIN H12 B.NE +27 292
>Eric_Tran: EHUWY 14J HEW +30 503
>Matthew_Larocque: II I3 .I +2 294
#note Lol, ran out of time.
>Eric_Tran: UY M11 .UY +14 517
>Eric_Tran:  (I) +2 519
#note Tough to beat Eric two times in a row, but second place is nothing to sneeze at either.
