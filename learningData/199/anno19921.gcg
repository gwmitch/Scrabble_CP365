>Jesse_Matthews: ?AACEGS 7G CAG +29 125
#note Correctly passed on N2 ACREAGES, but no excuse for missing 7D SCALAGE 81. Just plain whiffed on it.
>Nigel_Richards: AGIMNRT N5 .MIGRANT +69 141
>Jesse_Matthews: ?ABDEIS 13H BADdIES +82 207
#note Definitely not playing ABIDERS in the same spot, screw the several extra points.
>Nigel_Richards: GHHI 10D HIGH +22 163
>Jesse_Matthews: EEINSSW E5 EISWE.NS +94 301
#note It's a little too early to celebrate yet, but I would appear to be luckbagging Nigel!
>Nigel_Richards: AINRSTT C7 STRAINT +80 243
>Jesse_Matthews: AEFLORU O1 FAUL. +30 331
#note O7 FUERO# 44 is better than my play. Would help to know it!
>Nigel_Richards: AW J8 .AW +27 270

>Nigel_Richards: EOO H12 O.OE +21 291
>Jesse_Matthews: IINORUV 14D VIRI.N +13 378
#note When Nigel's playing off a few letters several turns in a row, I'm getting concerned. I don't know VIRINO#, but I'm not about to play it at D1 to open the board up. If Nigel's going to bingo, he's going to have to give me something juicy back once he does. This play allows for that by almost entirely blocking the bottom line (with the exception of EN- or ED- words), clears off some of my junk and gets closer to emptying the bag.
>Nigel_Richards: AO D10 .OA +21 312
>Jesse_Matthews: DDENNOU D4 UNDO +18 396
#note Now Nigel REALLY has me worried. Give that I have the last two Ds, I want to at least force him to have the blank and make it a D, or magically have something like ETOURDI to play as a bingo at B1.
>Nigel_Richards: AQ 12L QA. +48 360
>Jesse_Matthews: DEEEINY C3 EYE +20 416
#note The goal is to continue to make things as difficult as possible for Nigel to bingo on this board. This play takes out the DSOS/ISOS possibilities.
>Nigel_Richards: AEEPRRU 2N P. +8 368
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEEINU 14K EN +15 431
#note Nigel's play of PA has me really concerned. The only way I can see him winning at this point is by getting an EN- or ED- bingo at 15H. I opt to make a play that not only blocks that, but sets up the possibility of an S play down there using my blank.
>Nigel_Richards: AEILMRR 2L LI.. +6 374
>Jesse_Matthews: ?DEIRUV 1G VIRtUE +30 461
#note I can't see anything big that plays in Nigel's final rack, but I'm not about to risk losing the game. Many plays are better than mine, but this one gets the winning job done.
>Nigel_Richards: AEMOPRT B2 TRAMP +44 418

#note ZOMG...I haz beat teh Nigel Richards!!!
