#note Only bested by J2 ONCOSTS#, which I didn't know. Collins bingos have come up a lot more often than I'd hoped, and we're only 9 games into Worlds...

#note I'm correctly alarmed at the lack of quality bingo lanes, but perhaps shouldn't been so concerned with closing one down by playing KEP at H13, which sims best over my play.

#note ...if Peter is holding something like this, I'm screwed. And he was. He shouldn't be after URAO, yet he was. I'm so screwed.

#note I'm not concerned with him bingoing, but he has set himself up with a nice OOH play if I don't do something. I'm basically blocking his H play and then still able to potentially draw RETYING or TIGERLY#, or an I for YITIE# at 14J. Still trying to minimize spread loss despite a clear loss already. Quackle prefers only 7L TYG# to my play.
