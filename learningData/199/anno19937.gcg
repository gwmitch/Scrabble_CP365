#note One of those times where you're happy to go second. Thanks for the P!

#note Nice fit.

#note My lack of Collins knowledge shows here. I10 EUGH# for 33 scores 11 more.

#note Several options like E3 DOEKS# 42 would've scored more, but have suboptimal leaves. My play strikes a balance between scoring well and leaving options for next turn. Besides a D and S for use with COALISE#, I also have DOF# plays available next turn and an E and S to hook HET for TWS plays there. It probably offers the most flexibility in scoring for next turn over any of the other moves.

#note Quackle prefers a number of plays using the V and also the D for COALISED#. Saving the S for HETS plays next turn is certainly considerable, and the V is typically a bingo killer. That said, I decided just to go for points and turnover here, because no particular lesser scoring play had a good enough leave in my opinion to justify taking fewer points. Besides, given that the V does block things up, it could come in handy if Joanne were to make a blatant fishing play next turn.

#note NERVY is suggested in the same spot, but I'm not buying it. YR(I)VD at N10 also seems wrong - 32 points more is not enough in my mind to burn the blank here, especially when the pool looks so friendly to DNR? draws after my play.

>Jesse_Matthews: ?DINQRR N12 R.ND +16 274
#note Quackle prefers O1 QI right away. From my perspective there are two Us in the pool unseen, I have a blank and an i to go with my Q, so why not aim for a Q bingo for at least one turn? Seems much less dangerous than playing QI and potentially drawing two consonants in a tight match with nowhere to easily dump a lot of consonants on the board. I have the opportunity to do so on this turn and with favourable conditions to draw a Q bingo, so I'm gonna override Quackle on this one.
>Joanne_Craig: BT I10 B.T +14 274
#note Uh oh.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EGIOQR O1 QI +35 309
#note Ok, after Joanne's last play I need to be focused on maximizing my response to any bingo that she might have drawn. It's time to get rid of the Q and be ready with a hopeful bingo response of my own.
>Joanne_Craig: FO 3B FO. +12 286
#note Fortunately for me, she has not drawn one.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EGORWW C5 WOW +23 332
#note Unfortunately for me, I drew two Ws. Quackle prefers the F13 placement of WOW, blocking off the bottom S line. This is completely wrong. It's very possible that Joanne has a bingo hooking OOF that leaves me with no ability to play a bingo of my own back. Yes, I'd still have the P to play 8s off of, but why make this harder on myself than needed? My placement of WOW does have the danger of her making an easy Z play, but let's keep her last play in mind. She is very unlikely to have kept the Z on her rack, and she's been fishing for the last two turns. She would have to have drawn the Z after her last two tile play, and even if she does have a Z play there, I'm being given yet another TWS line for bingoing. The board just looks better and better for me to bingo on no matter what the scenario if I place WOW where I've placed it. Overriding Quackle here again.
>Joanne_Craig: I 15N .I +9 295
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EGINRR 15A hERRING. +74 406
#note My only consideration on choosing my play is in finding a way to kill the worst case scenario, which would be a huge bingo on Row 15 with the Z on the DLS. Forget 2A RESPRING, I'm taking 9 less points and eliminating the most imminent threat. If she has defied all logic by hitting something like ZANANAS at B6 (impossible given that her first fish of BIT happened before I played WOW), then I'll pull a Marlon here and walk out before the game is over. The most probable high point responses from her would be B10 ZONATE or B6 ZA/ZOA. I can deal with those if they happen.

#note 2C SPAZA# is best here, but didn't know it. No excuse for fast playing my end game and missing SPAZ here though. Focus, focus, focus...

#note And with that, I've finished in 28th place at the world championship Scrabble event for 2014!
