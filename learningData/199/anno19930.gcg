>Jesse_Matthews: ACINORS G6 CO. +9 61
#note I was afraid that there could be a Collins only bingo in this rack. There were in fact three...the highest scoring is SARONIC# at 7D for 81. Oyyyyyy
>Irfan_Siddiqui: AEIOSTX 6G .IAO +8 47

>Irfan_Siddiqui: EEMT 5H METE +20 67
>Jesse_Matthews: AEGINSV O7 S.EAVING +66 157
#note HEAVINGS# is Collins only. I saw it as a possibility but given 5 point challenge and not knowing the word at all, I opted for the one I knew.
>Irfan_Siddiqui: EEEIR 4K EERIE +14 81
>Jesse_Matthews: EFFHINS 3L FEH +32 189
#note O1 FIFE is better. Rushed this one.

>Irfan_Siddiqui: AEEILTU --  -126 81
#note Had a bit of a heart attack for a bit there as I challenged, and much to my relief his play came off the board.
>Jesse_Matthews: FIINOSY H8 .NIFY +15 204
#note Given what I know about his rack, I want to limit his ability to do anything with his S. I'm sacrificing a bit of equity here but I feel the situation warrants it.
