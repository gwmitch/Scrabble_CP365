>Suresh: ?ABDGKV 8G VAG +14 14
#note had a big urge to play KAB. somehow felt better playing  VAG. KAB gives a lot of parallel play options beneath it. VAG is defensive. DK likes things a bit open. Last game of the tourney, lots of pressure, good to keep things tight. Thought about a change. Would have changed if I was playing someone with a rating less than 1750. Against a good player, always start if you can. Prevents them from getting a healthy 36 pt lead or even worse a big scoring bonus, if the opponent bingos the second turn there will be openings to pick off and it probably won't be a damaging 85+ score but a 70.

>Suresh: ?BDIIKR J7 BIRK +28 42
#note Brilliant, got an I for the VAGI hook, didn't like the second one though. Missed KINGBIRD at 6E ( didn't know it), BIRK is the next best option.
>Dave_K: O -O +0 8
>Suresh: ?DEIIRT 11D TIDIERs +74 116
#note I didn't see DITSIER, but even if I had seen it would have still opted for TIDIERS, TIDIERS keeps things tight, DITSIER gives ER floaters for 8s and a 7 letter bonus to fit neatly under the DI. Here again don't let DK have easy bonus options. TIDIERS puts the E just above the TWS for a  dangerous JQX five letter word than the I at the same spot with DITSIER. But a bingo at this stage seemed more likely.

>Suresh: ?EEOOPR 12C POO +16 132
#note Didn't know the 3 bonuses through the T, had  to settle for this option.
>Dave_K: CEFORTY 13B FOY +32 52
>Suresh: ?CEEINR 13G sINCERE +80 212
#note should have played SCRIENE to block out the SINCERER option. I was just being ultra-safe. Happy to shoot ahead by 150+, didn't want a careless error.
>Dave_K: AACEERT K1 ACERATE +72 124
>Suresh: ABEGOUW 14A GAW +32 244
#note This was the move I took the most amount of time, and I am glad I sussed this one out, QUACKLE agrees wtih me. The obvious choice at this point is to block the board with the 2 blanks already out. I just couldn't see a decent 4 or 5 through the A (1K) and I was right, there aren't any that reach either if the TWS, I couldn't spot a good play through the C as well that could block the TWS lane above. In fact there is a word that I didn't know BOCAGE, I probably would have played it if I had known it, but QUACKLE still thinks GAW at 14A is better. It seems a bit volatile and open, but scores well and a decent leave. Still early days to block out the game, with the JQXZ and the 4S to come
>Dave_K: DMNNORU N10 MOURN +35 159
>Suresh: ABDELOU L8 LABOU.ED +78 322
#note Good pick up.. playing the bingo at L8 seemed more defensive than at F4.
>Dave_K: ADELZ O7 LAZED +52 211
>Suresh: ILMNORS 3H MIS.NROL +72 394
#note This one is really harsh on DK, I am having ridiculously lucky pick ups.
>Dave_K: JNTUY 1J J.UNTY +51 262
>Suresh: AAFIIIS -AFIII +0 394
#note At this point I've just mentally switched off from the game. I was very sure it was in the bag for me, I had to change with this rack didn't mind keeping the I over the A. I did challenge JAUNTY, I was 99% certain of it. also was a bit annoyed that he blocked me from playing the only 5 letter word that had 3Is in it. had a lot of spread to burn so I thought I'll jiust be sure.
>Dave_K: IPX M7 PIX +42 304
>Suresh: AIOSSUW 15A OW +33 427
#note Very careless, I overdrew and DK correctly took away the H and gave me back the vowels. I had to block the TWS at A15 with OW, could have scored much more if I had the H.
>Dave_K: ADEINOV 4C NAEVOID +82 386
>Suresh: AAISSTU 5B TAIS +16 443
#note HOLY CHICKENS!! I was just thinking about what I was going to have for supper after playing MISENROL and led by 180+ with about 25-30 tiles remaining. DK is unbelievable only 51 behnd. He would have scored 90+ had I not blocked him by playing OW. QUACKLE wants me to dump and block with EAU at E4. No siree, I will not allow DK have any opportunity to come back by leaving tiles in the bag for a good set up play to end the game with a bonus. With the tiles unseen I could see him getting things like LEAFIEST and ENLISTEE through the floating A and N. I couldn't see anything that would end with a D at L15. In fact there was only one ( I didn't know this ), SHEETFED, if he had played it, he certainly deserved to win.
