>Eric_Tran: ADEOOTU K5 ODO.ATE +32 32
>Matthew_Larocque: ILLPQRV J2 VILL +17 87
#note Sets up QI for 21, playing QI now has a pretty horrid leave.
>Eric_Tran: EEINRRU 10F REUNI.ER +62 94
>Matthew_Larocque: ?PQR 3I Q. +21 108
>Eric_Tran: EEGNNOS N10 SENGO +27 121
#note Wasn't sure, but it gave me a good play in return so whatever.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIKPRT 12L PI.K +30 138
#note I wasn't sure on PRICKET, but this seemed like a good alternative anyways.
>Eric_Tran: AAEEENY F6 YA.E. +16 137
>Matthew_Larocque: ??AERTW 13G WATERin. +85 223
#note All the other bingos score less than 75. I scored this as 81, though.
>Eric_Tran: ADEEJNZ H12 J.DE +60 197
#note Bleh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGMNNO L1 MANGO +25 248
#note Maybe I should play something that gives less back?
>Eric_Tran: AAENTUZ 1L .AZE +45 242
>Matthew_Larocque: ACENSTW 2L .WA +39 287
#note Good thing I had an A here.
>Eric_Tran: AAHHNTU 14H .AH +30 272
>Matthew_Larocque: CDENOST G13 .ON +16 303
#note I thought there might be a bingo through the E here, but there is only ENDOC(A)ST which I didn't know. I debated *CENTODES, PENTODES and CESTODES are good however. I decided to just get rid of this spot... sort of.
>Eric_Tran: AEHNTTU E3 UNHAT +23 295
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEPSTX D7 EXACTS +49 352
#note I played this quickly to save time, but I missed some better plays. Notably (N)EXT, D4 ASPECT, G7 P(O)X(E)S. Even (N)AP gives me a good shot to score good next turn.
>Eric_Tran: EFIILST 8A FLE. +42 337
#note I didn't consider the cheap points he might get off the X.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIMOOU C7 F.M +33 385
#note DOOMFU(L), and it's not even close.
>Eric_Tran: CIISTUU 4A CUTI. +20 357
>Matthew_Larocque: BDEIOOV A1 VOI.ED +36 421
#note I agonized over this play, but it seemed unlikely for him to have a bingo from the V or F. I also think I need to score points still, instead of blocking for minimal points.
>Eric_Tran: DEIIRSU J2 ....I +15 372
#note So FISSURED is a word that would win the game if he gets it.
>Matthew_Larocque: BBORSTY G3 BOYS +18 439
#note Under time pressure, didn't want to chance YOB not taking an S. (O)NLY sets up BOTS to go out.
>Eric_Tran: DEIPRSU 15A RESUPI..D +93 465
>Eric_Tran: DEIPRSU --  -93 372
#note Whoa! I thought this might be valid too. Way to give me a heart attack, man.
>Matthew_Larocque: BRT I13 ..B +10 449
>Eric_Tran: DEIPRSU 15K PURSE +31 403
#note Not going to challenge this, I already have the win.
>Matthew_Larocque: RT 9C ..T.R +12 461
