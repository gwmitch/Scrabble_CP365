>Dave_Wiegand: OZ 7F ZO +33 33
>Jesse_Matthews: EIINNRS 9I IN +6 28
#note As horrible as this looks, it's actually right on top with J7 REIN. 
>Dave_Wiegand: AEILNPR K5 PLAINER +89 122
>Jesse_Matthews: DEINRSS F6 I..RD +21 49
#note This board is already not looking so promising for me after his play, but I still don't need to panic into plays like mine. It's totally fine to drop the S for 7F ZOS#.
>Dave_Wiegand: ALNUW 5B UNLAW +35 157
>Jesse_Matthews: ENOOOSS 11C ONOS +28 77
#note The OOO draw was not ideal. Neither was my play - the duck suggests OOSE in the same area is stronger. No need for me to worry so much about holding onto an E at this point.
>Dave_Wiegand: DGHT 6E D.GHT +24 181
>Jesse_Matthews: EFOORSV 12C OOF +23 100
>Dave_Wiegand: TT C10 T..T +8 189
>Jesse_Matthews: CEEJRSV B4 J.VE +22 122
#note It's hard to make this play right after he's played TOOT (which suggests he's sitting on a nice rack for bingos), but I don't see what other option there was.
>Dave_Wiegand: EGGT A7 TEGG +20 209
>Jesse_Matthews: ACEERST 11H RET.ACES +60 182
#note More Collins-only knowledge that could've been useful - 14C SECRETA# for 66 would've been a little less reckless. My chances of winning are pretty slim regardless, however, so recklessness is not necessarily a bad thing.
>Dave_Wiegand: BILMP O6 BLIMP. +36 245
>Jesse_Matthews: DEINOUV M6 UNVOI.ED +82 264
#note And with this lucky pull from the bag, I'm right back in it!
>Dave_Wiegand: ADEEEEU -ADEEE +0 245
>Jesse_Matthews: ??EEIOS 4B .OE +26 290
#note I saw L1 SEMEION# and passed on it, opting to non-bingo score for at least one turn and open up a less dangerous bingo line for the next turn, or at the very least use my S for a SJOE play and get a cheap 30ish points. With both blanks I'm in no rush to bingo yet.
>Dave_Wiegand: AAIS A1 AIAS +27 272
#note Dave has just played the last S (other than the one I have and the two blanks I have). This is very useful to me for board control purposes. Only I can make TOOTS plays for bingos at this point, and he has just blasted open the top half of the board as well.
>Jesse_Matthews: ??CEEIS 3C SEnECIo +79 369
#note There are a number of options in this spot, and two of the best to block up the board are SEMEMIC and SELENIC. The first one I missed entirely, and the second one I wasn't 100% on. The last thing I wanted to do was lose a precious turn unnecessarily, so I played a bingo I was 100% sure of that didn't offer a juicy QI play or something else equally disastrous.
>Dave_Wiegand: IQ L4 QI +26 298
>Jesse_Matthews: DEHKRTY H1 KH. +30 399
#note 2I KYTHED is much better than my play. Didn't know KYTHE was a verb and wasn't about to risk it!
>Dave_Wiegand: AFNORWY 2D RAY +32 330
>Jesse_Matthews: DEFNRTY 12L Y.T +24 423
#note I haven't tracked properly at this point in time, so I'm being paranoid. My paranoid play is not particularly good though, since any -ED words are still easily playable.
>Dave_Wiegand: ABEMORW N10 M..ER +42 372
#note ...not to mention it gives up some easy points.
>Jesse_Matthews: DEFNORW 13E FROWNED +75 498
#note Lucky for me, I continue to luckbox my opponents and get to bingo out on my less fortuitous opponent.
>Jesse_Matthews:  (AABEUU) +16 514
