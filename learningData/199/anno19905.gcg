>Mike_Ebanks: ADF 8G FAD +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: EELOPSV 7F VOLE +21 21
#note I need to develop better anagramming skills.
>Mike_Ebanks: LT G6 L..T +8 22
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIPRSV 5F PAVISER +82 103
#note Thanks, Mike. PARVISE also plays vertical for 86.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEN 4K DEN +15 37
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGNNRU 4C GENU +14 117
>Mike_Ebanks: AALNU C2 LA.UNA +16 53
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEMNRT N1 CEMENT +29 146
#note Oh geez, missed a nine here. Almost played RETEM for 31, but decided that CEMENT made it harder to get a good play down the O column.
>Mike_Ebanks: IQ D1 QI +23 76
>Matthew_Larocque: CORSTYZ 8A COSY +47 193
#note Mike held his own word here, not being sure if it took an S. The only six that ends in -UNA with no S hook is JEJUNA.
>Mike_Ebanks: ABRT 1K BRA.T +30 106
>Matthew_Larocque: AIRSSTZ O6 IZAR +41 234
#note Wow, the first thing I looked for was TZARISTS. That's both hilarious and terrible. Game-destroying miss.
>Mike_Ebanks: HOW N8 HOW +24 130
>Matthew_Larocque: DRRSSTX B7 T.RR +8 242
#note See what happens when you miss stuff like that? Also, sim likes dumping an S for one extra point. I don't.
>Mike_Ebanks: EO 6J OE +12 142
>Matthew_Larocque: DELPSSX 10K PLE.S +24 266
#note SEX is 34, but I seem to cling on to the X a little too much. Esses too. PLEX scores 29 at 3F without using an S.
>Mike_Ebanks: BI 11J BI +16 158
>Matthew_Larocque: DJKOSTX L8 JO.TS +45 311
>Mike_Ebanks: AI 3M A.I +14 172
>Matthew_Larocque: DDKNOXY 3F YOND +19 330
#note Again, refusing to play the X because I don't like a lot of the plays that use it. KYLIX is new to me though. Any X play in the top region seems to give a lot of points back. Thought about NODDY too, but I liked YOND because it did not give him much to work with, and the board is already hard to score/bingo on.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??AMU 1D .UAlM +45 217
#note Well, okay Mike, if you have blanks to spare than don't let me stop you from scoring.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEKTWX D7 W.TED +18 348
#note Partial rack - unloads some letters and partially obscures his bingo possibilities.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?EHIINR 12E INHERIt. +69 286
#note Partially.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGIKOX 13B KIEF +27 375
#note Sim says KIF is better as well as EXI(N)G and FO(R)K.
>Mike_Ebanks: AEGIOU 14A OI +16 302
>Matthew_Larocque: GOX A14 .X +27 402
>Mike_Ebanks: AEGU 2I AGE +15 317
>Matthew_Larocque: GO G12 .OG +8 410
#note BIOG
>Matthew_Larocque:  (U) +2 412
#note Early bingo and esses padded my lead enough that I could afford a game-destroying miss.
