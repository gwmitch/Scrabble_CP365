#note Finally I draw a bingo in this spot, but whatever I play is going to score 79 and leave me 5 points behind. What do I play? Do I want to maximize volatility and hope I draw multiple spots for a big K/Q/Y play? Do I want to go defensive and hope he's screwed over by a terrible rack? I spent 5 minutes staring at this position and couldn't find anything I liked. This seemed like it might offer the fewest counterplays, so I went with it.

#note We both played the endgame right, and Rik's sequence of high-scoring plays turned out to be just enough. Crazy ending to a great game.
