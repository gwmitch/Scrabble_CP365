>Jesse_Matthews: AEHOPRS 8G HOP +16 16
#note Is -AEPRS really that much stronger than -AERS? I guess I need to study my superleaves...

#note Quackle prefers H13 DEV, but I'd rather save the D and Z for potential draws of DZO or ADZ/ADZE next turn.

#note C7 AVE is the star play here. Played too quick.
>Donna_Stanton: AAIJLOW 13B IO.A +8 161

#note Believe it or not, this is only the second highest scoring play! 10A QUAvERIEr is available for 75 points, which is awesome. Not sure I'd play it though, even if I did see it. Q on the TWS line offers some easy points back a number of times.

>Jesse_Matthews: ADEEEIW 2J .IEWED +26 276
#note It's a tossup between this or J8 EWE. Both score the same, but both do very different things to the board.

#note RUBIN or BRUIN down to the same N are better rack balancing moves. However, I am looking to score and minimize 8s. BRUIN and RUBIN still allow for 8s through the R. I'm ok with her making any non-bingo play to the TWS, because after that it'll only be a matter of managing the board and scoring to win this game.
>Donna_Stanton: AILNTUX O7 TAXI +37 329
#note Turns out any move I made down there was good for me. She told me after the game I blocked LUXATING!
