#note Quackle prefers being a bit more adventurous and playing FROG or FROW in the same spot. FROG could be argued I suppose, but FROW is certainly wrong with all of its hooks. That said, -RW is not a great leave and as such I understand why it doesn't sim well.
>Brett_Smitheram: ADEMNNR 15C R.MANNED +83 139
#note Turns out FROG would've been ideal, offering him no TWS plays, and FROW would've given DAMN for a decent score but no bingo. Oh well.

>Brett_Smitheram: ?INOPSY O8 PIONeYS +93 232
#note Brett says after the game that he was not 100% sure of PINYONS, and so opted for the one he knew for sure.
>Jesse_Matthews: HIIKLTV N10 KIT +36 198
#note Got too fixated on putting the K on the TLS. N9 KHI is certainly better, not just for the additional points but the SKI hook it creates.

#note Costly time for a word knowledge gap to show its ugly face. No recollection of BILEVELS, which would've played at 3E. My play is a distant second best.
