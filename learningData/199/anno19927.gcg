>Dean_Saldanha: IRRY 8G YIRR +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIMSUV 7E VUM +21 21
#note There is a seven in this rack, and plays for 102 points. Hard to look past VUM with a rack like this.
>Dean_Saldanha: OPW D6 POW +21 35
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEIST K5 CoESITE +90 111
#note I got a second chance, and found the 2x2 this time.
>Dean_Saldanha: GOR 8A GRO. +24 59
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFINN B6 FA.INA +19 130
#note Missed an eight. J7 F(R)AENA is awesome because it doesn't take an S and mostly takes out the existing S hook. FA(R)INA seemed decent; gets some turnover, keeps EN, and stops Dean from playing an eight here. With a lead against an opponent better than I am, I felt that I should focus on defense and turnover instead of being greedy and stupid. Even if saw FAINEAN(T) I probably would have been on the fence about whether I was spelling it right or not. Q also likes L9 FANE, but that creates more S-hooks which I don't want.
>Dean_Saldanha: IO J11 OI +4 63
#note This had me wondering.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEJNOOT I11 JOE +23 153
#note He's almost sure to have an L - so obscuring OI has to be right. Tempting to keep the J and wait for an A to show up - but there's no guarantee that the spot even stays open. I decided to just play the J off now and I crossed my fingers that he didn't have the K (or P to a lesser extent).
>Dean_Saldanha: AEILR A11 ARIEL +20 83
#note So he must have had some strong leave with the L that didn't bingo with OI - *ORALISE? But that doesn't make sense because he killed the S-hook. Maybe a T instead of the S?
>Matthew_Larocque: EENOPTU H12 POUT +37 190
#note Lucky draw of the P. TOUPEE plays for 38 at A1! But it also opens more. POET and POUT actually sim very close. There aren't many situations where I willingly keep a U.
>Dean_Saldanha: IIIIUU -IIIIUU +0 83
#note Bad luck for Dean. His exchange gives me more time to block stuff.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEENN A6 EN. +11 201
#note I missed a semi-tricky play for 28 points. It's the only play that scores, too. Since I didn't see it, I liked EN(G) because it makes it quite difficult to open up this corner of the board. Sim prefers playing these same letters for less points - C8 (O)NE. I don't see why.
>Dean_Saldanha: EHX C11 HEX +32 115
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEEIN D12 NICE +27 228
#note Still missing ACNE from last turn, but this is pretty much the same thing.
>Dean_Saldanha: NW 6J W.N +13 128
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAAELO 5J O.A +12 240
#note Okay, this is completely terrible. This is an auto-exchange rack which is plainly obvious. Then I thought about COALA but didn't like the disaster potential; cheap Z points or a high scoring eight. But I was so determined to find some way to make WON hooks a little harder to use. When I played OCA, I didn't even realise I was setting up ridiculously easy bingo territory. I know that sounds humanly impossible. It probably is humanly impossible.
>Dean_Saldanha: BFU 4L FUB +28 156
#note If I don't play OCA, then he's likely to score much less than 28 on this board.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAADELS O4 SALAD +31 271
#note I fluke an S-draw after playing off two letters, and I am able to eliminate this immediately. I don't even know. I don't even know.
>Dean_Saldanha: DEZ E10 ZED +30 186
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEGIL N6 ABELIA +23 294
#note I saw GABLE but I didn't know GABBLE! However I liked ABELIA for defense/turnover.
>Dean_Saldanha: ?DEINSU 4D INfUSED +73 259
#note But that's irrelevant because the stench of that OCA play was too severe to repair after only two turns.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEGGMT O11 EGGED +32 326
#note I'm still ahead by a bingo, but I try to never underestimate my ability to find a way to lose.
>Dean_Saldanha: HT G3 H.T +10 269
>Matthew_Larocque: IKMNRTY 3G .IM +20 346
#note I'm pretty sure there's no bingos, but since I am paranoid I opt to not empty the bag. This sims far down since I'm keeping the K and the Y on my rack. There's a chance I don't draw another vowel which would be inconvenient, especially if I have to spend one turn dumping the Q.
>Dean_Saldanha: LOTV 14K VOLT. +16 285
>Matthew_Larocque: AKNQRTY 3B QAT +26 372
#note I draw the A to go with the Q - funny. I was planning to play TRANQ M11, but I didn't see TRA(N)Q E1. QAT also plays for 29 alongside ZED.
>Dean_Saldanha: ORST M1 TOR.S +16 301
#note Didn't know TORUS - took the free challenge.
>Dean_Saldanha:  (KNRY) +22 323
#note Early 90-point bingo combined with early rack trouble for Dean gave me enough breathing room to eke out the win.
