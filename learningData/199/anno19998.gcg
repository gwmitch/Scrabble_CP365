#note he was worried about how to block CASTLED after challenging if it came off. maybe ENDWISE at N7?

>JD: ENNRRST H1 REN.N +17 235
#note also considered TARN at 5H, which keeps the E, but ENRS isn't wonderful, there's only one T left, and I liked having both the top and bottom open in an even game with a good leave. if he takes one I can take the other.

#note normally this would be an insta-exchange, but there are so many vowels in the pool that I thought it was worth being greedy and taking the points. it's close on a sim.

#note I think I'm 117/120 to win (as long as he doesn't hit INVESTER). I can't afford to play short or block because INVEST at 15J is like 50 points anyway.
