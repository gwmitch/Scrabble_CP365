#note 9A GUARANA is so cool but i don't think it's right. quackle is flipping out already and thinking i should do C12 WAGE... no need, i don't think. it wins by % by about 1% so it's not that much.

#note i seem to have forgotten that ALFA is a word, but FA sims a little better.

#note even though it didn't end up mattering, i should really watch out for these types of plays for the JA- snapback in this case. still sims best but C2 PHONE is another worthwhile option.
