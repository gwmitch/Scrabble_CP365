#note (BE)VY is another good option.

#note TEND sets up a hopeful spot.

#note Thought about ORIEL, but liked this better.

#note (T)O looks like a great option. It keeps a nice leave and opens up a great seven lane that's hard to block. AEROLI(TIC) is a cute play.
>Dave_Wiegand: EINNOUU 2D UNION +9 221
>Noah: AEGILOR C7 LOG.IER +24 187
#note (T)OG looks like a good play, here. (C)IGAR is also good. I just didn't think of those plays. AEROLITIC is also there.

#note Noooo. I didn't realize the repercussions of this play until Dave's next play. I also somehow didn't think of (T)EE.
>Dave_Wiegand: EGL J10 GEL +32 299
>Noah: EEIPRSZ 3B ZEP +32 272
#note Thought of ZEES and ZEE, but ZEE blocks bingo lanes, and ZEES seems to give too many comebacks. I hated playing this, giving away a buttload of hooks, one of which Dave probably has. I didn't think of PREZ, though, which Dave pointed out after the game. Seems like the play here!
