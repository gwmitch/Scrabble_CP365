#note Nooooo! Noooooooo! I got too caught up praying for an I. I completely blanked on METHINKS. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! *hangs head in shame* I'm going to be very sad about this for a very long time.

#note Yeesh. More really really tough Scrabble on a night where my brain just wasn't up to the task. This position is hard. Let's assess. David's fishy plays signal the blank. CAT signals the S as well. Board is volatile. If he bingos and I do not bingo back, I lose. If he bingos and I do bingo back, I win. If he doesn't bingo, I don't necessarily win. So why ADORN? Well I'm sort of hedging my bets here. Firstly, I take out the best bingo lane, giving me a chance of orphaning David's bingo. BUT I leave the board volatile, because I want two lanes open. Are these contradictory goals? Maybe. David has an S, and I'm trying to reduce its usefulness. ADORN scores decent points and gives me a chance to win in a bingoless endgame. That's important too. ADORN also gives me a decent leave. BUT it keeps an I, which could very possible double itself. The first sim shows Quackle favoring F3 AROID and F2 RADIOS. It feels like those plays give up on getting a bingo and that they might be banking on David holding some of PVW. But Quackle isn't inferring what I'm inferring from David's last few plays. Likely, he has none of PVW. Likely, he has S?. So surely the forecast is bleak and I need to work towards my own bingo, right? Ugh, this is too damn hard. ADORN supposedly wins 44% with S? specified for opponent's rack.
