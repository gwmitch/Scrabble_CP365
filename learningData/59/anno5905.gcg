#note This position was a tossup between this play and taking the points with AMITY, and I spent amost 2 minutes on this rack - rare for me on an opening rack.  What swayed me?  If the 3rd vowel was anything other than a U, I'd have taken the points.  But BU struck me as having the potential to get really nasty.  AIMT can become very powerful with a decent draw.  Not to mention that I can hook the Y with my M.  The sim agrees, preferring this choice by 4 points over AMITY.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: DILMSTT 7I M.LT +19 75
#note Best.  Wasn't thrilled about playing for 19 and giving him an easy 4 to O8, but there weren't any really good options in this position.
>Greg_Heidler: ANOZ 8L AZON +45 150
#note  Making my last play I figured I'd give back 30 - 35 by opening up O8, but I didn't expect this.  Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: DDEIOST 10E ODD.TIES +66 141
#note Also playable at 10C for 64, but this is best. 
>Greg_Heidler: EHO 11K HOE +24 174
>Jim_Burlant: CGIIOTV L2 VIG +24 165
#note While I was still in striking distance, I was now getting concerned; I felt like I was hanging by a thread, and for the 3rd time in the last 4 turns I had drawn yet another rack that didn't leave me many options.  Not to mention that the board wasn't opening up in a way that would favor my coming back.  This play sims best.  To this point I have played a perfect game, and through no fault of my own I am sitting at 36% winning chances.

#note So much for playing well.  My first big mistake - a bunch of row 9 plays, which I either didn't see (9E LOUR) or didn't know  (9D CLOUR) sim first and second, with 14B UTRICLE (which I didn't know) coming in third.  My (flimsy) logic at the time was that a productive fish (5 A's, 7 E's, 4 N's and both blanks still unseen) could get me back into the game, but the reality is that I just blanked when I saw this combo.  This miss seals my fate for reasons that become obvious in a couple of turns.  Best play sims at just under 35%, this play comes in at 30.  So through this I've surrendered all of roughly 10 equity and am at 30% winning chances. 
>Greg_Heidler: BEY 12D BEY +36 237
>Jim_Burlant: CIIORTU -IOU +0 173
#note Now I'm rattled. I have the option of scoring and keeping garbage (c11 COIR or C11 COURT), or I can balance the rack but not score.  I10 TUI 7 wins the sim with 14% winning chances.  I considered that, but felt that if I was going to play for chump change a second straight turn I better be opening up lines or getting rid of EVERYTHING I want to unload.  But even if I put down the  best play on this turn, it wouldn't have mattered given his next rack.
>Greg_Heidler: DEILNRS 14B REDLIN.S +72 309
#note This is where I paid for missing the best play 2 turns ago; where does he go with BEY if I take out 9E with LOUR on that turn?  
>Jim_Burlant: CEIIRRT G6 RI. +6 179
#note N10 CRIER wins at 1.6% winning chances, with this play coming in second.  I also considered NERRITIC* O8, which I was sure was phony.  I rejected it because I really didn't think it had much chance of staying.  Greg told me after the game he definitely would have challenged that off the board.  I thought it best to try and open new lines, that 33 points wouldn't help me a whole lot in the absence of any bingo lines.
>Greg_Heidler: ?AEIMRW O1 AIRWoME. +98 407
#note OUCH!!!!! Incorrectly scored as 95.  
>Jim_Burlant: CEEIORT 5E RICE +20 199
#note After my RIB play I was actually thinking I might have still had a slim chance, as I was going to bingo down the O column myself with either ERECTION or NEOTERIC.  I certainly didn't expect him to pull a blank bingo out of the bag.  The game is now over except for the final score.  Actually, that's not true - in a 4-ply sim this is one of only 2 plays that sims with ANY winning chances (0.02%!).  But for all intents and purposes, AIRWOMEN put the final nail in my coffin, and from here on I was just trying to find scoring plays, period.  And some of the racks didn't even let me do that.
