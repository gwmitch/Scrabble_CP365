>Jeermy: AAEFRVX 8G FAX +26 26
>Matthew: AADDELR 7H LAD +17 17
#note Didn't feel like the L was worth four points, but ADELR is really strong. Quackle likes 9G AD.
>Jeermy: ?AENPRV 6G PAVE +32 58
>Jeermy: ?AENPRV --  -32 26
#note I was wearing my BAT shirt and was channelling the powers of Simpsonized Winter. I wanted to see how long it would take Jeermy to notice.
>Matthew: ADEINQR 6D QINDAR +31 48
#note Major counting fail. I jotted down the 9C placement as being worth 28. What is wrong with me?
>Jeermy: ?AENPRV E1 REPAV.Ng +74 100
>Matthew: DEEFTUY F2 FEY +39 87
#note He still didn't notice my shirt. Why do I even bother dressing up for him when he doesn't even look at me?
>Jeermy: ABEINRU 1A UNBA. +24 124
>Matthew: DEGLPTU 3B TUP..D +26 113
#note I know well enough to understand why 3B GULPED is better, but if I somehow just don't see the play, that doesn't count for shit.
>Jeermy: DEIIIOR 7A IODI.E +22 146
#note Why won't he look at me?
>Matthew: EGLNOST K3 LONGEST +71 184
>Jeermy: GIINRRT A6 T.RING +21 167
>Matthew: AMNTTUW L2 MAW +28 212
#note Oof. WA(L)NUT is a big miss. Can't afford those errors.
>Jeermy: EIIKLRS 8K .KIER +42 209
#note Bullet dodged there.
>Matthew: ENRTTUU M1 TURN +24 236
#note M3 TENUTI is sexy. My play sims below a bunch of stuff. No need to blow all my bingo tiles, Quackle says. The U is not totally poisonous.
>Jeermy: BEILMSW M7 W.MBLES +42 251
#note At this point, Sue at the board beside us is asking questions about my shirt. I slide down the back of my hoodie so that she can see the pictures on the back. Jeermy still hasn't noticed.
>Matthew: AEORTUV 13F OUTRAVE. +63 299
#note I can't blame him though. I envy his focus, in fact. I wish I could play a game without getting distracted by games beside me or my opponents' shirts.
>Jeermy: ?CEEISZ 11A .rECIZES +88 339
#note Take a sec to try and find the best move with my next rack.
>Matthew: AEHIJLY 1M .AJ +30 329
#note Okay, here's where the Scrabble gets really tough. First of all, I spent a good 2+ minutes verifying I wasn't msising my 50-point play on row 14. Next I tried to assess the possibility that I could get that play next turn. I think TAJ is a little greedy, and relies way too much on me drawing into a big play and Jeremy leaving the spot open. That isn't too likely. TAJ and a few other plays like N5 AJEE sim between 42-45% to win. The star play, according to Quackle, is won I had not considered. K11 JIVE wins 51% of the time. It's really quite brilliant. It sets up a huge spot for my Y. If Jeremy doesn't have the S (50-50 chance), he's in trouble. If he does have the S, he's gonna score there, but I will have drawn into my 50-point Y or H play on row 14 (hopefully). This was the kind of play I wanted to find. Save my HY for the hot spot, and somehow distract Jeremy from blocking it. JIVE is perfect; wish I'd seen it and considered it. Meanwhile, TAJ does give me a chance.
>Jeermy: AHIOOOS 14D OOH +27 366
#note Looks like Jeremy played this right. He needs to take that spot. Try to solve my next rack.
>Matthew: EHIILOY 15A OILY +42 371
#note At this point, Jeermy notices I'm wearing the shirt and exclaims in glee. But no time for that now, this is a tough endgame! Ok, what do we have here? I'm losing by a big chunk, but don't panic, because I have plays. The unseen pool looks vowel-heavy, and so is my rack. Potential problem there. Two triples are open. I can score very well at 15A, and I can score well and play defensively at 15E. At 15A we have OILY, HOLY, and HOLEY. At 15E we have HOLEY. My rationale: Jeremy likely can't score too too too well if I leave the OHO spot open, and I need my H to score some points for the next turn. I was sort of half right there. 15A OILY sims best amongst all plays on row 15, winning 18.38%. The top simming play, though? N10 OI. Wow, really? Anyone want to explain that one? I'm not smart enough for this game.
>Jeermy: AGIOOST 15F OSTIA +21 387
#note One of a few ways to win.
>Matthew: CEEEHI 13B ICH +25 396
>Jeermy: GO J4 GO +13 400
#note Great game. I like my shirt.
>Jeermy:  (EEE) +6 406
