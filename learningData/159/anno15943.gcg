>Doug_Riblet: AJKU 8F JAUK +30 30
>Matt_Canik: EEGNORV 9E VOE +19 19
#note His placement of JAUK strongly implies he didn't have an S. With that in mind, this play makes it extremely hard for him to get points at all.

>Doug_Riblet: LNOT 3I T.LON +12 82
>Matt_Canik: ?HORSTY N1 HiSTORY +84 225
#note RHYTO(N)S for 52 is also noteworthy, but I don't think the blank is worth 32 points. I was also mad that he blocked HERSTORY :(
>Doug_Riblet: AA 1M A.A +18 100
>Matt_Canik: BIMOOOU M5 BOOM +21 246
#note I didn't know what to do with this, if I should play OM/MY to kill any openings or what. I finally just decided to score a lot of points and draw a bunch of new tiles to see if I can get out of this bad rack. Champ player likes this 2nd to BOO in the same spot.

>Doug_Riblet: Q 6I Q. +11 133
>Matt_Canik: DFIIOPX 3C FIX +35 293
#note I like this play so much more because I'm holding a D. 
>Doug_Riblet: AEZ F12 .AZE +36 169
>Matt_Canik: DIIOPSW 15C WIP. +10 303
#note I need to block the 3x3, but I really want to hang on to the D for 5E.

#note Intentionally passed the ARETE spot because I have the last A and this limits his bingo replies.
