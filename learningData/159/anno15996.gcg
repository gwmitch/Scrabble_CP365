>Jarrett_Myskiw: AAW 8H AWA +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIIIMS -GII +0 0
#note 9G GIE? Meh...
>Jarrett_Myskiw: AEENORS 9G ARENOSE +70 82
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMOPSU 7G UPO +19 19
#note L4 OPIUM(S) or 7I OPIUM look better here.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: ?EENRTW L2 WEsTERN. +72 154
#note M6 TWE(E)NERs may be better here cause of the score difference.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIMSSV 10A MASSIVE +74 93
#note 10C MAVISES looks like a rather large improvement. I didn't see it.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: ADEJ 2J JA.ED +64 218
#note Ouch.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAENOQT 5J QA. +24 117
#note Not sure if 5H QANA(T) is actually better than this, since drawing into TRAN(Q) would just distract me from making better plays the entire game.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: ITUY A8 YU. +24 242
#note I saw IT here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAENOTY 10J YE +29 146
#note 1M YEA looks much better.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: BIOT 1M BIO +22 264
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINOOT D4 ATONIA. +16 162
#note 8L (N)AOI probably. This kills my best lanes and doesn't open anything else.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: EFILT E4 LIFE +27 291
>Joshua_Sokol: BDFKORS 3I BOR.D +45 207
>Jarrett_Myskiw: IT 7B TI.. +5 296
>Joshua_Sokol: DFGKPRS E9 D.RK +21 228
#note E9 G(I)P or D(I)F both have more synergistic leaves apparently.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: AEIOR 12C OA.IER +22 318
#note My vowels :(
>Joshua_Sokol: FGGLMPS -FGGLP +0 228
#note I missed C7 (I)MP(S). I think that I should keep LS here as there are a lot of points left in the pool.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: IX 13C XI +38 356
>Joshua_Sokol: ELMNOSU 14A MUON +25 253
#note Should I just score and hope for the best with SOLUM? (I didn't know the word at the time) Or maybe SOLEMN?
>Jarrett_Myskiw: IT 15A IT +20 376
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ELNRST 15D STERNaL +76 329
#note What a rack to draw when it's no longer that useful... :P I guess SaLTERN over this.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: DHI 6I HID. +36 412
>Joshua_Sokol: EFGHOTU B2 FOUGH. +42 371
#note Funny word to basically give up with. It's apparently number 3 on the sim's list. 14F HO and F5 EF are ahead, and C2 HUG is close. I don't think I tracked right here so I didn't see myself winning in any scenario.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: CEGGLNV A1 VEG +29 441
#note Best, apparently.
>Joshua_Sokol: CELPTZ F2 ZEP +39 410
#note B9 P(A)C to stick him with some stuff. -5
>Jarrett_Myskiw: CGLN K1 C.. +5 446
#note Best.
>Joshua_Sokol: CLT 3A ..T +8 418
#note -1 to B10 (A)L.
>Jarrett_Myskiw: GLN B9 N.G +6 452
#note -3 to B10 (A)G.
