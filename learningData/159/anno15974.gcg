>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIMNO H4 HAEMIN +30 30
#note Also considered HOMIE and shortly MAHOE. Not sure what is better.
>Ross_Brown: AEEORSS 10D SEROSAE +73 73
#note SEA(H)ORSE is cool
>Joshua_Sokol: LNOORRT I3 ROTL +14 44
#note Ugh, I4 ORLON. I am poisoned with the constant desire to have a vowel and 2 consonants left if I can. Also, ORT is better than NOR as a leave. Duly noted.
>Ross_Brown: DGVY E7 GYV.D +26 99
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIINOR 5E CRE..ION +40 84
>Ross_Brown: IOW L3 WI.O +14 113
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIRTY 7C YA.I +12 96
#note I believe 3K A(W)AY may be better than this. I thought I was likely to have my TEAR(Y) setup stay.
>Ross_Brown: ABR 8A BRA +20 133
#note OK so for some reason this looked unfamiliar and I almost challenged, and then Heather turned from the board next to me when I said "wow I almost challenged that, jeez!" and said "I guess you haven't been seeing many lately." I proceeded to crack up, cause that was awesome.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEORT A8 .OATRAcE +80 176
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEORT --  -80 96
#note I didn't know BAREBOAT. I thought this was good since it makes total sense. I guess I should have gone with something else.
>Ross_Brown: ORTZ A8 .ORTZ +26 159
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEORT 12A .ETA +26 122
#note (Z)OEA looks far better than this. This looks better than AR(E)OlATE J8, though.
>Ross_Brown: IPTU 9J PTUI +11 170
>Joshua_Sokol: ??AAORU 13C ARUgOlA +70 192
>Ross_Brown: BEU -  +0 170
#note Challenged!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHLNUW 11I WHEEL +35 227
#note I though UNWHEEL was good so I was frustrated that there was no spot for it. I think I should play 8M HEW here, even though this does a decent blocking job. I need to be scared of the X and the Q with that U I think.
>Ross_Brown: BEU H12 B.UE +24 194
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFKNSU 8M KAF +36 263
#note Good blocking move, lucky I had it.
>Ross_Brown: DIO E2 ODI. +7 201
#note When he played this, I thought he was setting up an L for L(ODIC). Turns out I was confusing ODIC with OTIC. I therefore completely missed I(ODIC) and S(ODIC), the latter of which I didn't know, as you'll see in a second.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNOSUV 9C GU. +20 283
#note 14A GUV seems very strong, but I need to play something like VENUS/SODIC.
>Ross_Brown: AEIINST 1D ISATINE +82 283
#note I don't know what Ross should do about the X fear. He knows I most likely don't have it after my last play, so maybe he should open the hotspot at 1D like he did. I'm not sure. The two 82-point placements are flip-flopping on the sim, but I think his placement is best considering the inference he can make. Also, I challenge SODIC and not IODIC.
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOSTV -  +0 283
#note I should have realized my confusion when he played this, but I challenged hastily as I'd never seen SODIC...
>Ross_Brown: DM 2D D.M +25 308
#note I was surprised he didn't have the X. This is better than J4 D(I)M because it blocks the easiest X spot.
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOSTV G3 VO. +16 299
#note I need to bingo or draw the X.
>Ross_Brown: GNP K4 P.NG +13 321
#note Ross said he drew 11 consonants in a row. Ouch.
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNQST 4D Q. +22 321
>Ross_Brown: DFJL 15F FJ.LD +16 337
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNSTX M1 ILEX +44 365
#note Here's where I make a HUGE mistake. I had around 6 minutes left on my clock. I saw that he was out with (F)ENCE. I counted XI and counted 50. I counted ILEX and I counted 48. I laid ILEX down pretty quickly as I was on autopilot to just play the play that left me with the highest score minus tiles on my rack. I saw he had C(I)NE but I didn't consider that I wasn't going out next turn. Ugh, disgusting. I saw the 12L XIS blocked and scored, but I thought this was playing it safe if ever he had some other outplay.
>Ross_Brown: CEEN 1L C.NE +27 364
>Joshua_Sokol: NST 15F .....S +17 382
#note So stupid.
>Ross_Brown: E 3L ..E +6 370
#note I didn't deserve that win.
>Ross_Brown:  (NT) +4 374
#note I almost blew it, and Ross was just extremely unlucky.
