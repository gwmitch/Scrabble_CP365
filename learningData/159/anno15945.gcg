#note Before this game, I had bingoed on my first turn in 2 of the previous 63 games and I hadn't missed a 1st-turn bingo in any of those games. It's about damn time I drew a rack like this lol. 

Of course, them I miss COELOME which is the best bingo. 
>Jim_Burlant: AAFFRRU 9K AFF +19 19
#note Jim said this was his rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ADIIIPS J7 P.DIA +21 87
#note ADIPI(C) seems like a good word to know, but this sims better by around 4 points. 
>Jim_Burlant: ADLRRU 11E RADUL.R +32 51
#note I guess keeping ARRU is a decent thing to do.
>Matt_Canik: CIIOOST G3 COITI. +14 101
#note I phoneyed Jim twice n round 1 and he didn't hold. I feel confident in my ability to do that again here.

>Jim_Burlant: EJOS O5 JOES +47 133
#note ...but I just set up his J instead.
>Matt_Canik: EGIINRX H10 R.EING +31 159
#note I thought this might be a word (it isn't), but it set up XI which I really liked. Q says I should just play FIXER or FIXING or XI F5.

>Matt_Canik: AABIQXY G13 QI +44 203
#note After I play this, Jim goes on full tilt mode ("there's just nothing I can do about this game") despite being down ~50 points...
