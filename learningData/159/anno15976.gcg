>Heather_McCall: EGORU 8D ROUGE +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CINOQT F7 Q.OIT +16 16
#note Q(U)IT gave back much more than 1.1 points I think.
>Heather_McCall: EIMNSV 12A VIMENS +45 59
>Heather_McCall: EIMNSV --  -45 14
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEINNS 12C CENSINg +83 99
#note I looked for 3x3s before challenging. I missed CoNNI(V)ES but that wasn't worth not challenging, since I was fairly certain VIMEN only pluralized to VIMINA.
>Heather_McCall: EIMNSV -  +0 14
#note I got another free turn! I was happy to be winning a good amount of challenges this tournament.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAADOU 11D AU.O +16 115
#note Almost AOUDADS, which I would have missed for sure.
>Heather_McCall: EIMNSV 10B VIM +21 35
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACDRT H1 CADAsTR. +83 198
>Heather_McCall: EGHINSY 5H .HYING +24 59
#note Something like I2 YEH/HEY looks much stronger than this. Even YES(s)ING or (D)YEING, but maybe Heather didn't know them.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEEIOR M2 DOD.IER +22 220
#note I was wondering if this was really my best play, since I knew it didn't have much more than a valuation of 22. 6H (T)OED and I5 (H)OED are looking far better than this.
>Heather_McCall: EKSU H12 .UKE +24 83
>Joshua_Sokol: DEERSXY N1 DEX +37 257
#note Didn't look very dangerous, and I was even setting my own Y up.
>Heather_McCall: AAE 8L A.EA +15 98
>Joshua_Sokol: EORSUVY O1 OY +31 288
#note When she laid A(R)EA I was sad, as I had VOYEURS for 118 at O2. Unfortunately that may have contributed to me missing D1 SURVEYO(R). I wasn't sure which was better between OVE(N) L2 and my play, but I didn't know ROVE(N), which looks like the 2nd best play. OVE(N) is doing better than OY in the sim, and also beating ROVE(N). Seeing SURVEYO(R) (and maybe even getting a challenge too) would have been brutal.
>Heather_McCall: OS L3 SO. +22 120
>Joshua_Sokol: EEPRSUV 2E UVE. +15 303
#note 3B PREVUE(D) looks better. I saw I had PREVUES, but I didn't know PREVUE was a verb. At least this does a better blocking job.
>Heather_McCall: AEFZ N7 F.AZE +42 162
>Joshua_Sokol: EEJNPRS 12K JEES +40 343
#note I felt this cut her score by more than 3B JEEP. It unfortunately cuts mine too.
>Heather_McCall: HMO 13K OHM +38 200
#note JEEP it is... hehe
>Joshua_Sokol: FGNOPRR 15D FORG.R +14 357
#note Just sealing the deal.
>Heather_McCall: TW O7 T.W +17 217
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNPTT 14B PLENA +29 386
#note Missed 14H (K)EPT until the turn after. I was hoping to win another challenge.
>Heather_McCall: BI 15A BI +16 233
>Joshua_Sokol: AINPTTT E1 P.TTI +14 400
#note Again hoping to win a challenge even though I wasn't 100%. I knew PUTTO and PETTO/PETTI.
>Heather_McCall: IL 3C LI. +6 239
#note She didn't realize she was emptying the bag.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABENRTW K9 BAN.. +28 428
#note Played too fast again. I only saw 1A TWER(P) until after I played BAN(JO), and I knew she would play something that blocked... I also thought I had two spots for ERTW but BAN(JO) blocks my own WERT/AT I9. Silly play. She wasn't going to see/block BAN(JO), I'm pretty sure. Oh, also, I thought I had points with WE/WA*/EN. *facepalm
