#note So, this rack looked quite familiar, and I had been eyeing COURBES for quite some time. I imagined it was some type of ballet move or something. It seemed like a word.

#note Boy oh boy was that a choke. Right afterwards Jason told me I should have tried SUBCORE*, and Andrew replied that that would be even more OBSCURE. Nice one, Andrew. That was a good way to tell me what I missed... I had two spots too. The other word in the rack is BESCOUR, but I didn't know it. Well, I'm never missing OBSCURE again!
