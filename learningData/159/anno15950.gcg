>Matthew_Larocque: BILNOOT 8E LOBO +12 12
#note Oops, BONITO.
>Michael_Bray: DENO 9F NODE +17 17
>Matthew_Larocque: AGHINRT 7F HARTING +79 91
#note I played this pretty fast. I wasn't 100% sure it was phony, but I was sure enough that I'd challenge it if someone had played it on me. Was kind of testing the grounds to see if Mike would challenge it or not.
>Michael_Bray: IX 6J XI +52 69
#note Looks like he didn't want to lose this X bomb though.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAACEN 5K AA +10 101
#note Seemed worth it because two As aren't nearly as bad as I always think they are.
>Michael_Bray: CIT 6D TIC +26 95
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEEFN 4L FACE +30 131
#note F(AIN)EANCE would have been a pretty ridiculous play.
>Michael_Bray: ENW D3 WEN. +14 109
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEENS 3C E.E +12 143
#note E(XI)NE maybe, didn't see it though.
>Michael_Bray: NOOT 8L ONTO +19 128
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENRSV N8 .aVERNAS +86 229
#note Wasn't positive on (O)VERmANS, but this is probably better anyways... despite setting up IE(S)T.
>Michael_Bray: UUUUV -UUUUV +0 128
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIRRRS 15J ARRI. +6 235
#note I can't believe sim ranks this so low - I have no good scoring plays and leaving the S open is crazy.
>Michael_Bray: EM 14J ME +22 150
>Matthew_Larocque: AEPRSYZ E8 .AZY +38 273
#note Haha, fitting to draw the Z after the 6 point play that set it up.
>Michael_Bray: DEN 10H END +15 165
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEPRSU 12H PERUsE.S +76 349
#note I didn't even see the more normal word of PREsSU(R)E, good thing this is also valid. I thought of PRESUmE(R) as well but wasn't totally sure either.
>Michael_Bray: JLO O1 JOL. +33 198
>Matthew_Larocque: BEHIUUY N2 YE.H +36 385
#note YECH was my mental thought process over keeping BIUU.
>Michael_Bray: ETV 5B VE.T +18 216
>Matthew_Larocque: BDIIKUU D11 BIDI +21 406
#note How could I miss (P)IKI, bad.
>Michael_Bray: ADQSU 15D SQUAD +57 273
#note And this doesn't get played.
>Matthew_Larocque: FGKRUUW 13B KU.U +18 424
#note 2E FUGU? There's an M out, though.
>Michael_Bray: IO 14A OI +16 289
>Matthew_Larocque: FGMORTW A14 .W +15 439
#note Wasn't sure on F(U)M(ER), but thought I might as well keep one in the bag.
>Michael_Bray: AGILLST 13G GAL +14 303
>Matthew_Larocque: FGMOPRT 14F MOR +32 471
#note Mike didn't take the last letter in the bag, which was an I.
>Michael_Bray: ILST F1 TIS +12 315
>Matthew_Larocque: FGIPT O7 F.G +9 480
#note I was trying to beat the clock, so no time to react to the better spot he gave me.
>Michael_Bray: IL 14M L. +4 319
#note Game ended after this, 480-327.
>Michael_Bray:  (IPT) +10 329
