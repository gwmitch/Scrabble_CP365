>Walker_W: BKO H7 KOB +18 18
>paulsid: FGGISTW -FGGW +0 0
#note Hmm, Elise hates that exchange.  Maybe too early in the game to worry about leave/balance?
>Walker_W: OOPP 10F POOP +24 42
>paulsid: DIIISTT 11C TITI +12 12
#note Elise likes it with the S for 8 more, which is my cutoff for an S, but DIS seemed pretty nice to keep.
>Walker_W: AEIV C9 VITAE +24 66
>paulsid: ADIMNSY J9 MY +35 47
#note I grew up with a lot of kid-speak because my mom runs a dayhome.  :-)  Wasn't sure of POOPY* if it was CSW or ours (it's neither!), and was admittedly a bit frustrated.  However, usually vs. a significantly lower player if the play gains a lot I will put it down and force them to decide.  I missed the obvious best: D(I)SMAY overlap at D10
>Walker_W: AEIRTY? 12F TEARIlY +75 141
>paulsid: AADILNS D10 DIAL +19 66
#note Not looking good, I try deseparately to open something and balance my rack.  Elise says DAP I8 is best, which seems apparent now.
>Walker_W: AEW I6 WAE +16 157
>paulsid: AGIJNSU -GJU +0 66
#note That was definitely one of the strangest exchange I've ever made.  I'm totally stymied as to what to do, and ultimately decide that I like the board as it is but not my tiles, so I just trade the nastier ones rather than spoil anything for myself.  I'd often keep the G for an -ING but not on this board.  Elise actually doesn't mind it if I'd kept the G, but likes JUS G5 or JA(Y) L10 the best.  Personally, I'd rather not close down anything since a player of this level is more likely to close at the expense of score.
>Walker_W: LMU H12 ALUM +18 175
>paulsid: AINNOSU -NU +0 66
#note Another bad exchange according to Elise.  It likes NAOI 13J best (by a hair), which I actually put down and then pulled off, mainly because I didn't want to keep a U.
>Walker_W: AII 11L AI +7 182
#note Eep.  I wasn't sure if ALUM was a fish or just covering the triple, but now I am pretty sure it's a fish.
>paulsid: AILNOSU 6I WAUL +9 75
#note Probably a bad play, I just wanted to balance.  I missed LA(M)INOUS.  After that, Elise likes A(M)U best, though mine was OK.
>Walker_W: EIINRW N9 WINIER +25 207
>paulsid: EGINORS O4 IGNORES +84 159
#note Not sharp, I missed SIGNORE which would have given me a valuable extra bingo line.  Elise likes mine better though, but the extra score of REGIONS the best.
>Walker_W: AX 5J AX +38 245
>paulsid: EENNRSU 15C RUNESMEN +61 220
#note I remembered this from somewhere, and was getting desperate.  Later in the game it hit me:  RUNESMAN* is/was the ISC handle of one of our club's players!  LOL!
>Walker_W: BDE O13 DEB +23 268
>paulsid: ACEGGHZ M13 ZAG +55 275
>Walker_W: DLOST M2 DOLTS +20 288
>paulsid: CEGHHOS 14E OH +28 303
#note Not liking all the crud piling up on my rack but I decide to score given there is at least a bit of synergy in the leave.  Almost played HOSE L1 which Elise likes best, I think I was worried about keeping CGH given what was left.  
>Walker_W: FNO N1 FON +20 308
>paulsid: CDEEGHS O1 ES +25 328
#note Getting low on time but eventually decide that spot is real dangerous with what's left if he has the last A, and the score's nice, and the S isn't too useful elsewhere.  Elise says to play G(L)ED K11 but I was hoping to keep that in my back pocket.
>Walker_W: JQV -JQV +0 308
>paulsid: CDGGHOQ 10M QIS +23 351
#note Considered exchanging as well, but can't really pass this up with an OK leave.  Lots of junk in the bag too esp. after the trade.  Elise again favours K11.
>Walker_W: CEU K11 CLUE +22 330
>paulsid: CDEGHIO L3 HE +20 371
#note Tough play and low on time, I am just trying to score and not play too many tiles because the bag is grim-looking.  Elise likes 10B H(ID) to setup the C hook, but I didn't have time to think ahead.
>Walker_W: EFNR? G3 FERNs +17 347
#note Obviously felt like his back was against the wall.  He said in hindsight JO was probably better to dump the J.
>paulsid: ACDGIOT H1 GOAD +34 405
#note Had he played JO I would've countered with GOD H6 and that probably would've won anyhow.
>Walker_W: JRTV 7N JO +9 356
>paulsid: CIT 4D CITED +16 421
>paulsid: (RTV) +12 433
>paulsid:  (time) -20 413
#note Jeez I misadded after QIS and misscored GOAD so I had this as only 401-356!
