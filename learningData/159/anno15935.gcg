#note I thought EI would be more volatile and more likely to bingo than IOPT. According to Quackle, I was wrong about the latter. Also accordng to Quackle, this scores more on average next turn. Not what I expected. This appears quite close to JEFE.

>Noah: ACEEMNV M9 VEN.ACE +34 323
#note It seemed like leaving both bingo lanes open would help me here. She is pretty likely to bingo before me, I think.

#note I noticed after Quackling that this game was really short! I played only 5-7 letter words.

This game was pretty well played by me. Not much error.
