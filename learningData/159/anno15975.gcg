>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEGRX H4 RAXED +28 28
#note Why didn't I play RAXED with the R on the star?
>Ross_Brown: EILOQRU 8A LIQUORE. +107 107
#note Would have saved me a lot of points.
>Joshua_Sokol: ??DGOOY 7G Y. +18 46
#note DOx(O)lOGY is a word I knew. Others I missed are DO(U)GhbOY and (I)DeOlOGY. I didn't know GARDYLOO or PEDOLOGY. In any case 7E GOO(E)Y looks better than my play. Missing DOXOLOGY was really bad.
>Ross_Brown: MTU I5 MUT +26 133
>Joshua_Sokol: ??DGNOO 4A DOgGONe. +70 116
#note I knew there was something with the O. GODr(O)ONs is vaguely familiar I missed KINGWOOD and KINGHOOD (I knew KINGHOOD) through the I and ONDOGr(AM)S, which I didn't know. Ross said he almost challenged this.
>Ross_Brown: KPY B3 P.KY +21 154
#note Defensive-like play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIILN 9A ANI +20 136
#note I wanted to be able to score if I didn't hit the bingo. Not sure if this is correct.
>Ross_Brown: BO 5H ..BO +16 170
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEHILS 5E HA +22 158
#note I wasn't sure how much better CEILS was than ACILS and I wanted to be able to play something with (QI)S, so this over 9F EH.
>Ross_Brown: EOSSU 6B .OUSE +21 191
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIILOS C2 CI. +16 174
#note Just (YET)I?
>Ross_Brown: AAH 4J AHA +21 212
>Joshua_Sokol: BEILOSV 3J LOBE +27 201
#note OBI? Lots of Es left. (LA)V? This looks fine.
>Ross_Brown: IIISTTU E8 .UISTITI +66 278
#note Cool.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGISV 15D V.SAGE +42 243
#note Oops. VIGIA... Bad play.
>Ross_Brown: GINVW 13B WIV.NG +30 308
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIMRT 2I EF +30 273
>Ross_Brown: AFNNO 1E FANON +26 334
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIMRST J9 REEMITS +74 347
#note This looked more than 2 points more defensive than METIERS or MEISTER 14I. Maybe METIERS/VISAGES is better.
>Ross_Brown: CEILOPT 12H CO.PILE +32 366
#note Maybe COMPEL instead? Ross said there weren't that many vowels in the bag so I would need to have drawn pretty well to capitalize on this play. He thought he needed to go for ZWJ to score. The sim likes COMPEL a good amount better.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEJLRZ O8 RAZED +68 415
#note I saw the Rs in the bag and therefore preferred RAZED. The sim agrees. I kind of lucked out here.
>Ross_Brown: ADENRTT B8 ..DRA.N +30 396
#note Ross was so close to bingoing out... Nothing plays, this is best.
>Joshua_Sokol: EJLRW 10I J.WEL +15 430
#note I figured I would get J stuck if I played (C)LEW. In the end, this is 2 points better.
>Ross_Brown: ETT N7 TET +7 403
#note Ross got BSed and I didn't deserve this win, again.
>Ross_Brown:  (R) +2 405
