#note Once I convinced myself that there were no triple triples, I looked no further for plays, because I thought TEGUMENTA* was valid. I figured my only chance to win was to try this in hopes that by some miracle Noah would miss or not know the hook. As a matter of fact, this is the only bingo, and it wins about 11% according to the sim. 13K GAUNT does best (about 15%), but my chances are pretty grim even without playing a phony net turn.

#note Oh darn. For a moment there, I thought I had come up with a brilliant way to steal a victory. The best valid play is LIPA at A7 which loses by four. One last chance for a win next round.
