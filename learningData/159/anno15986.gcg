>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?ADELWY 8D YAWLED +34 34
#note Pretty sure he held a blank here - he looked for bingos for quite some time, but he didn't miss any.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIQSTU E5 AQU. +26 26
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?BCEILR H1 BERnICL. +83 117
>Matthew_Larocque: GIINPST 3F ST.IPING +76 102
#note I did hold BERnICL(E), but had no reason to challenge with a counter-bingo on my rack.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AINRSST 5B INT.RS.AS +59 176
#note Nice fit, but looks like neither of us knew that STRIPING has an s hook!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABEFOU 6B FA +28 130
#note Sim likes OF instead in this spot, or 9C FOE, but it's close.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IZ F8 .IZ +35 211
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEOOSU 10D BO.O +15 145
#note I didn't know LOBULOSE. I liked how this play opened an easy bingo line for me while also opening a tempting hotspot that he's likely to use.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: NOOR 1H .ORON +8 219
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEERSU 11G DEmURES +67 212
#note I was going to play (B)URSEEDs, but he blocked. Instead I play a phony out of the hundred valid bingos I have. *shrug* N column bingos can score 80, but didn't know the hook.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IMN 11C NIM +22 241
>Matthew_Larocque: EHOOTTY L8 HOO.Y +30 242
#note 6J HOOTY seems like the clear choice, but I forgot about SH here. 12A HOOT is probably better, but I wanted to make the board harder to bingo on.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EITW 8K W.ITE +33 274
>Matthew_Larocque: DEELRTT O2 RELETT.D +60 302
#note I barely even thought about this one, I just played it. I didn't really deserve to keep these points, but Juraj was nice to me this game.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: MO 10J MO. +23 297
#note Guess that X is still up for grabs.
>Matthew_Larocque: AADGINU 12A GAUD +30 332
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EEK A12 .EEK +27 324
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIJNU D1 JAUN. +40 372
>Juraj_Pivovarov: GIV 2C V.GI +14 338
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFHIPX B14 XI +42 414
#note PHA(T) 7J is awesome and I forgot all about the P hook, but I think closing the board with XI still makes the most sense.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AV 15A ..VA +12 350
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEFHP 6J HEP +29 443
#note Since I actually tracked correctly, I know he has a dead rack. Unfortunately, I missed tons of good plays here like 7J CAPH and 6J HEPCA(T).
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AELNORT 13C NEAT +21 371
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEF 12G EF +22 465
#note Missed his out, so blocking that is best. Wish I knew HEPCAT.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: LOR 5L ORL. +8 379
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (AC) +8 387
#note I lost 10 on time and he lost 30 I think. He must have also been underscored by 10, since we agreed his final score was 347. Most of my plays were easy this game and I got away with two phony bingos - don't usually get this lucky against Juraj.
