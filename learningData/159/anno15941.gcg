#note WIG and TWIG sim above this by about 1.6 and 0.1 points, respectively.
>Darrell_Day: ?ALRST -L +0 0
#note He said he had R(U)RALIST here with a blank in it somewhere, but decided against playing that because I would just hook an S on the end, so he exchanged. I dunno what he had, exactly.

>Darrell_Day: FLOW 12B FLOW +29 96
>Matt_Canik: ENNOTUU 6H UN.U +4 110
#note This was a weird-ass turn. Sim likes NOUN 13E more than anything else. That has a valuation of 10.5. That's not very much valuation at all. This is about 2-3 points back.

#note Well I didn't play AROINTED earlier but I played AROYNTED now so I guess it's ok.
>Darrell_Day: ACFNU O7 CANFU. +33 369
>Matt_Canik: ADEHLTV 13J VELA +44 394
#note This was a bizarre turn too. I was trying to make inferrences about his leave after CANFU(L) but couldn't figure much out. He's drawing 5 tiles into a pool that looks shitty, so his odds of having either the Q or the J are fairly high. 

I've got DAH/HAD for 44 at 13L, HA(F)TED for 42, VELA for 44, HEAD for 52, H(I)V(E)D for 24... like seriously there are a lot of options and I don't know what to do. I figured I built up a big enough lead after this that I could either cash a Q for 21 or 31 and be secure enough to probably win, so I'm not worried about a Q draw. I'm worried about the shortage of vowels in the pool, so maybe I should play DAH to keep one of those. But that leaves 3 in the bag, and if Darrell then plays QI we've got a tie game and I'm at the disadvantage because there are two in the bag... Yuck. I dunno. Q seems to think H(I)V(E)D is correct, followed by H(I)VE C7. I really have no clue. 
>Darrell_Day: ?AEINSY 2A .Y +20 389
#note Darrell elects to not bingo here to avoid drawing QJV. 
>Matt_Canik: DHJMNPT 14M PHT +30 424
#note I can pretty much deduce AEINS? was on his rack, and he's either sitting on easy outbingos or AEINQS?. Either way, I'm fucked. H(E)MP 7C is a better option here, though. If I draw the E then he's forced to play a much tougher endgame, assuming I see JE(U) K4. I didn't. 
>Darrell_Day: ?AEINQS 13G Q. +21 410
>Matt_Canik: DEJMN 7C M.N +21 445
#note Since I think I'm stuck with the J, I'm trying to keep points on my rack to stop him from racking up spread one tile at a time. Maybe it's right to pretend like I don't see JEU and play MEND, then surprise him with an out if I can?
>Darrell_Day: ?AEINS B8 .ANI.ESt +28 438
#note SANSEI is a ridiculously useless 6 in all situations except this one, where it plays for 44. 
>Darrell_Day:  (DEJ) +22 460
