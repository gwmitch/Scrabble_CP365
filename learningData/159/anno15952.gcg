>Kolton_K: AFIIRTT 8D FRITT +24 24
#note I think this is best. Q obviously prefers something like FIT because AIRT is going to bingo 32% of the time next turn.
>Ken_C: ?DILOOV 9H OVOIDaL +66 66
>Kolton_K: AEGILRS O3 GLAIRES +88 112
#note Hooray I know OVOIDALS.
>Ken_C: ?JKQVXZ -  +0 66
#note Challenged
>Kolton_K: AAEEGNS E3 SANGA.EE +68 180
#note K3 AGENES(I)A is equal to this.
>Ken_C: IJN F2 JIN +30 96
>Kolton_K: DEMOTUY 1F DUTY +36 216
#note This and ODEUM and DEMY are about equal
>Ken_C: IKNW D10 WINK +27 123
>Kolton_K: ELMOOVW N6 MO +22 238
#note Wanted to take away a big X play

>Kolton_K: AAEEELO 6D A.EE +7 276
#note Nothing is very good here. 6E (G)ALEAE for 11 is best.

>Ken_C: LPX L1 PL.X +32 318
>Kolton_K: AEILOTZ C9 ZOA +30 337
#note A lot of options here. L9 (D)IAZOLE comes out on top.
>Ken_C: BGH 4C BH..G +22 340
>Kolton_K: EIILOTT K3 .OIL +17 354
#note 14G IOLITE is best. But with his obvious consenant-heavy rack, I didn't want to set up something like TODAYS.
>Ken_C: ACDH M5 DACH. +26 366
>Kolton_K: EEITTTU 1L .UTT +18 372
#note This game is going to come down to whoever draws the blank.
>Ken_C: AB 8K BA. +17 383
>Kolton_K: ?EEIOTU J9 .E +4 376
#note I took a lot of time on this turn. There are no bingos available with EINNRRSY so I am free to open another lane because he is probably going to block row 13-15.
>Ken_C: EINNRRY H8 ..NY +7 390
#note So after I draw the S, I realize that with his rack, he can play N9 (L)INENY and block pretty much everything. (The only bingo would have been really tough to find-- 11G qUESTIO(N)). But he was out of time and just played this angrily.
