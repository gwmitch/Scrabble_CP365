#note Okay, there's four tiles in the bag.  Maybe I should play something short - like dump the Q - so I won't empty the bag.  Nah, I have nothing to worry about.  There's no playable bingos on THIS board. Well, except for 15D FLOWERET/FLOWEREd but there's no way Quackle just happens to have that.    And if even if Q does have the right letters, so what?  I got this game.   But just for assurance I'll play G3 JINK.  Wait...JINK empties the bag.    If I'm gonna play off four I might as well play HIJAB.  Yeah, HIJAB is a good play.  I GOT THIS!

#note Impossible...  ... .... .....  Omg.   O_O   Good thing I didn't play JINK.  I also didn't even see FUELLERS (yeah, no kidding).  I totally missed it and knowing what the playable bingos are in endgame is actually a strength of mine.
