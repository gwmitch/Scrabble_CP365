#note This was tough. I tacked the L on the end because I figured the back hook gets blocked a ot of the time and LN has bad synergy.

#note Doug smacked that S down really quickly. I think he has another one, which makes CO(D)ER weaker.

#note I saw this and almost traded immediately, but then I realized that this holds GIB/JAMB, and I can actually fight through this and maybe score enough to win this game. Q agrees that I should play through. 
>Doug_Riblet: EGU 1L .UGE +24 307
>Matt_Canik: BEGIPTV N5 GIBE +28 319
#note Q says GIB/JAMB can win over half the time. I'm a bit skeptical of that. I was thinking that if I can draw the S for JAMS I pretty much win the game after GIBE, and if I don't I'm not totally out of it, or something like that.

#note Doug said this was the rack, but he had mistracked and thought there were 7 in the bag. 
>Matt_Canik: EFPRTUV 15J FER +23 370
#note Damnit. I was so proud of this play. I figured I was very likely to draw an I, and I figured Doug would immediately play SAT O7 if he saw it, which would set up the sequence that ends up happening. But PURT(Y) is just a lot better- it seds up FIVE or FIVER and he can't block both of them. PURTY also wins when I draw some other tiles. Also PURVE(Y) and PUTREF(Y) win 5/8 times.
