>Dave_Wiegand: ELOOUWY 8D WOOLY +30 30
>Rafi: AEGKMNT 7C MANGE +25 25
#note TEAK is another good option. The other play I was considering was M(O)NK, which despite simming worse would have turned out a lot better. MANGE sets up my K nicely though, and the extra 5 points make it better than MONK.
>Dave_Wiegand: ?EEINTU 9G dETINUE +65 95
>Rafi: AEGKRTU K4 KURGA. +22 47
#note Lots of close options here, such as AUK/AE, KAT for 27, TUGRIK, and apparently UKE/EM and KU(E). This board can get closed in a hurry so I liked opening it up a bit with KURGAN. AUK/AE (which I didn't consider) sims best, although I imagine Quackle has Dave playing at 6B too often, allowing me to bingo through the I or N with EGRT.
>Dave_Wiegand: DHOOSTT 10H HODS +42 137
>Rafi: EEINRTU 4I NU.E +16 63
#note Another hard decision. I'm already well below 20% winning chances. I find it excruciatingly hard to play U(K)E here, making an obvious fish with few bingo lanes available. Missed UNITE/URINE for 26 aside KURGANS. An important stat is my bingo percentage next turn - Quackle gives me a 51% bingo chance after UKE which can't be right. NUKE sets up a more realistic bingo lane for next turn at the expense of a less valuable static leave. Another play I considered was RUE/AWE, setting up my T - a play that ensures openness but might give too much back. Also considered ETUI/KI.
>Dave_Wiegand: ILOOTTW 8M WOT +23 160
>Rafi: ABEGIRT 3L BIG +16 79
#note Sacrificing a few points to unload my I with 7 unseen. There are 6 unseen A's though so GAB/BAG might be a tad better.
>Dave_Wiegand: ADILOTT 2K DOTAL +25 185
>Rafi: AAEHLRT 1E TREHALA +83 162
#note Back in the game!
>Dave_Wiegand: ABEIRTT 3C BIRETTA +75 260
#note Not.
>Rafi: ?DIIMVZ 4B VID +24 186
#note Only 3 A's left now, so VID is probably my best chance back in the game.
>Dave_Wiegand: DEIIRVY 6B DEV +24 284
>Rafi: ?IMPRXZ A1 ZIRaM +52 238
#note Sucks to burn the blank but I can't score much elsewhere. XI and MELD/MIX are simming slightly better, looking to draw an A for ZA for 52 or an AVID play. I should maybe play MIX actually given that Dave didn't save an A - if I can hit ZA for 52 and save the blank I might have a better shot.
>Dave_Wiegand: CEFIIRY O4 FERI.Y +16 300
>Rafi: FIINPPX 4F XI +20 258
#note Hoping for FE/FA next turn for 28 plus a Q draw for Dave. Also trying to conjure up some crazy ideas for _ANO___ plays to fish for.
>Dave_Wiegand: CEEIINO N2 ..ONE +19 319
>Rafi: FNNOPPQ -FNOPPQ +0 258
>Dave_Wiegand: AACEEII 7K .AE +12 331
>Rafi: ACELNOS I9 ..O +3 261
#note This is not easily blockable... even something like F(ID)S still allows SECONAL, SPANCEL and CENSUAL. I just traded in the other N so Dave is unlikely to have just drawn it.
>Dave_Wiegand: ACEFIIR E7 ..RIA +10 341
>Rafi: ACEJLNS 10D J.N +12 273
#note Stupid J. The lane is still potentially hard to deal with, but a play like SPIC seals the deal.
>Dave_Wiegand: CEFINQS 2A .F +10 351
>Rafi: ACELOSS 12G SOLACES +74 347
#note Omg I might win!
>Dave_Wiegand: CEINPQS 12C QIS +30 381
>Rafi: PU 6J U.P +11 358
#note URP! I really wanted to nab this one. Oh well :)
