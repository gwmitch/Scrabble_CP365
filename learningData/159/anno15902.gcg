#note i think even without a strong inference that FEET is best but after that move it kind of seals it.

>cesar: ACDENTU 8E UN.... +12 47
#note ?? unacted seems completely phony but honestly i wasn't sure i should play it after his last three moves. whatever though, still a massive equity loss. (-46)

>cesar: CCELMST 12B CEL.M +18 95
#note this is probably wrong, should do something like MAC or MOC. quackle likes ELECT 13K which is OK i guess but i'm not a fan. in general i don't want a closed board against james but CELOM is kind of reckless. (maybe ELECT is more so, so just do MAC). (-4)

>cesar: AEENRST A5 EASTERN +77 280
#note i miscounted this as 80 and wanted the three extra points (and one fewer lane), but A4 EASTERN is better.

#note just JO, i think, but i was not a lock to win this and wanted to block the R.

#note ? poor move; I3 ZITI and go out next turn. i think i felt bad for drawing well again.

#note at this point james took the J off the top left and went out with JOYRIDER for a lot to win the game, but i wouldn't let him have it.
