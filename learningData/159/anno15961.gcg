#note TEWED seemed unnecessary and dangerous.

>Joshua_Sokol: DEINOSS H10 .ODIES +30 98
#note I had a bad feeling about this... I didn't consider I7 ID, which looks better.
>Shan_Abbasi: EHIORST 15A SHORTIE. +86 139
#note I think HOISTERS is better than this.

>Joshua_Sokol: BEINRSU 8J .UB +8 156
#note I was going to play BURSINE(S) or RUBINES(S), both phony, so it's a good thing that he played JACKS. I thought I knew this rack but I didn't. I thought BURNIES was phony cause of BURNY*. I also considered 14A (K)EN, but I felt the need to bingo next turn.
>Shan_Abbasi: A 14A .A +22 200
>Joshua_Sokol: EINRSUY -UY +0 156
#note I didn't play L8 (B)UY cause I was scared Shan would strike back with an M word at M9 which wouldn't give me an S hook to bingo with. Maybe I should play BY instead.
>Shan_Abbasi: EX 9L EX +21 221
#note nice play.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRSV F4 INVAR +19 175
>Shan_Abbasi: ?ILNPST 4E P.NIToLS +70 291
#note A7 SLaP(JACKS) seems to be a worthy option as well.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEERSU 3G EAU +13 188
#note This seemed decent as it forked the board pretty well.

>Shan_Abbasi: AEEMN 1K ENEMA +44 414
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ELRSUY A8 SkY..... +69 291
#note I didn't even look for a bingo here cause I needed to bingo next turn to have a chance to win. That said, 12H (D)ELUSoRY may be correct. I didn't know bLUE(JACKS) but I was happy I got to play this word which I will likely never play again. The only play that has a chance of winning looks like 2A ELUSoRY.
>Shan_Abbasi: MOO C3 MO.O +30 444
#note Another good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: EELNNRU N1 ..NE +6 297
#note Trying to maximize spread. 10L NUN or NURL are simming better than this.
>Shan_Abbasi: CEGLOUV 10L GUV +30 474
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNRRU O4 RILER +21 318
#note Yuss. I got away with this knowing it was bad. We both missed (D)OLCE, but L8  (BEG)IN is best.
