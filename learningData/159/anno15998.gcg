#note I like how this doesn't slow anything good, and makes 7's less playable.  spent about 3 minutes on this.

#note There's an open, juicy Q spot, so STORMY is feasible.  I didn't want to open the board though; hoping to parallel on line 7/9, and down L, to kill the board.  Sim also likes keeping MOST instead.

#note Sim likes QUININ.  I would help balance out that massive hotspot at M3.

>Eric_Tran: EINNPST 13B TENPIN +29 207
#note N1 INSTEP!  Else, quack likes volatile plays like N1 EN or IN.  I figure to be much closer to bingoing, but I have a lot more to lose if she hits that spot.

#note I feel pretty confident I will win.  Going for spread now. Looked at the pool, and there are no bingoes she can hit to the x3. Missed the tricky 5A DELIS. CRIB 10E and C(ABA)L also do well.

#note Was debating which of SCULCH or SCURCH was a valid word.  Decided to make the safe play.  Best is CUR 10E.
