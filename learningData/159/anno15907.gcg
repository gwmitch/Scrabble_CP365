#note Dave pointed out the more defensive (C)ALyCiNE  after the game.
>Dave: EEELPST 15H STEEPLE. +86 234
>Chris: DEEJ 14F JEE +28 275
#note Forgot to write my other tiles here. I think it was three vowels. Otherwise JEED or JEWEd would probably be superior.

>Chris: AADIIQU L2 QUAI +35 310
#note I was feeling pretty confident at this point.
>Dave: BIMRSTU 13G BRUTISM +90 354
#note NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
>Chris: ADEIIOY C10 YO.IE +22 332
#note Threatening QAID/QADI for later. There's almost no vowels left, so I still have about 20% winning chances despite what happened last turn. Sim says playing QAID first wins 26% and is best.
>Dave: AHN 3F NAH +20 374
#note Glad to see another vowel go down.
>Chris: ADDIOVV B14 OD +10 342
#note Sims best! 53% to win!
>Dave: DNRRUWZ A11 NURD +10 384
#note Off by seven, according to Quackle, but good enough for the win!
>Chris: ADIRVV 2E VAR +19 361
#note I wish I could say this is the sequence that I played, but I only saw it a few moments after hitting my clock. What I actually did is far more embarrassing. At least there weren't any wins I was missing.
>Dave: RWZ 11N Z. +11 395
>Chris: DIV N2 VID +18 379
#note Another pretty well played game (until the end), but the win just wasn't in the tiles.
