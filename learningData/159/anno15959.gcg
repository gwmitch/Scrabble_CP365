#note I didn't think MINES was 4 points better than BINES, let alone 7.5... 
>Jackson_Smylie: EFHIMNT 7F FEH +25 41
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGGINS 9F G.. +6 21
#note I hated it but it's winning the sim. I also considered (WEB)BING.

#note I missed BEIGNES... cool
>Jackson_Smylie: ?IMNRTZ L9 Z.TI +26 75
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CKLPST 13K PST +24 119
#note So I actually considered J4 LoCKST(E)P but didn't think it was a word. Others I missed are  LiCKSP(I)T 12F and LoPST(I)CK or LiPST(I)CK 12G. I didn't know the first two but there's no excuse for missing LIPSTICK. I also missed TSK but I'm not sure which is better between PST and TSK.

#note I missed TiCKLI(S)H too? Jeez...
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AADORY N3 ROADwAY. +65 140
#note Nice find.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACGKLT 4L CL.G +18 163
#note I wanted to block and keep __AK type plays at 5C.

>Jackson_Smylie: ACDEILO 11J LO. +14 184
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IIOTUW -IIOUW +0 197
#note Winning the sim. I considered keeping the W for WAUK but it just sacrificed so many possible bingos.

#note I was scared to play this but it seemed like my only option.

#note I didn't want to open any other lanes but I guess 2 is good since I don't have an s.
>Jackson_Smylie: NU 14N UN +10 347
>Joshua_Sokol: DINNORS 8A ..N +5 379
#note Bingos with every vowel in the pool. I think it was a race to a bingo, and it seemed the only plausible way of me losing was if I couldn't bingo back. Fishing time! Yay! :P
>Jackson_Smylie: DEELOPS 9N .O +14 361
>Joshua_Sokol: DINORSV O12 VI.. +11 390
#note Vowel heavy pool and I'm pretty sure Jackson is close to bingoing. I don't agree with the sim's choices.
>Jackson_Smylie: A 3M A. +8 369
>Joshua_Sokol: ADFNORS 3B .F +20 410
#note Big mistake. I didn't consider that my only bingo if I drew an E was READORNS. That being said, better to play my F off somewhere else.
>Jackson_Smylie: ADEILPS 14B LAPIDES +81 450
#note Jackson knew that I had a very good chance of bingoing back so he didn't like playing this. He should have attempted a pass! I would have passed back though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADENORS 15A NOSED +33 443
#note I spent 7 minutes making sure there was nothing in this rack, as I had missed ANEROID last game! I went one minute over.
>Jackson_Smylie: I 6M I. +3 453
#note Jackson played the entire game very well. My fatal error was EF/FA.
