>Noah: DEEGIOQ 4D QI +24 253
#note It seemed like this would close off the left side of the board more than the other QI. 
>Ken_Clark: AM J9 AM +26 151
>Noah: CDEEGNO D8 .ENGED +22 275
#note Perhaps FEOD to weaken the S lane? I didn't play it because CEGN looked ugly.

#note Block that lane!

>Noah: CEHIKOV 4K HOICK +44 341
#note Feels odd to play after AFOOT but I think this is necessary.
>Ken_Clark: ABRTUYZ O1 BRA.Y +42 246
#note Actual rack.

>Noah: ADDIIMR 14B MI +18 393
#note He'd said I blocked a good play with HOICK, so I thought he might have BRAXY. So I wanted to block the X spot. This keeps the A which is good here, I think. What do you think? Was blocking the X good here or is it too unlikely that BRAXY is the play I blocked? (it wasn't)
>Ken_Clark: CDEEGJT 14H ..ECTED +24 305
#note Actual rack.

#note Main mistake here is missing EFFAcES. Gotta get better at finding words.
