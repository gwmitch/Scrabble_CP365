>JD: AAAERSU 8G AUA +6 6
#note I could also slot this reasonably at 8H.

>JD: AEINORS L6 ANOES.RI +68 82
#note spotted my mistake about 15 seconds after hitting my clock, was trying to keep time pressure on peter. ERASION fits on row 12.
>Peter_Armstrong: ADERSTW M3 STEWARD +93 121
>JD: ?AAFGIP K6 FAG +23 105
#note I think FAG at M13 looks pretty good here, since playing through the G is not so easy - instead I only considered N5 and K6

>Peter_Armstrong: UX 14J XU +53 188
>JD: ?AEINPV 15K PAVIN +39 144
#note while painful, his play also gave me a reasonable option to finally move on from this rack without obsessing further over non-existent bingos

#note I was able to get a few quick moves down in a row and challenge peter on time.
>Peter_Armstrong: WZ 3G W.Z +50 279
>JD: CGILNRU 9D CUR. +9 263
#note time to hit the books...chickened out of both RECULING# and ULCERING. by all rights this should've been a game-losing mistake.
>Peter_Armstrong: ADILTVY 1C DATIV.LY +66 345
#note obviously no bingo would've played had I found ULCERING.
>JD: EEGILNO 5E IGL.O +24 287
#note I thought I needed to at least score some points on this turn so that a potential bingo could keep me in range. I also ideally would draw one of the esses to hook SCURF so I was happy to turn tiles over.

>Peter_Armstrong: EHY D11 YEH +32 402
#note he was in a lot of trouble at this point given the great pool
>JD: AEIMRST A4 .ARMIEST +86 462
#note phew! I probably should not have won this game.
