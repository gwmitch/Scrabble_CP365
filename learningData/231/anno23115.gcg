>Norma: II -II +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEHIQT H5 QADI +28 28
#note I don't know why I didn't take more time to consider just QI here... This is clearly a mistake, especially given her small exchange!
>Norma: NOS 9H SON +19 19
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHIPTV K7 VIG +12 40
#note Given the strength of her rack, this play seems merited, but I should have once again taken more time and considered VEG instead. I then would have realized that VEG takes an A too, so there is no increase in defense between the two plays. But keeping the I has some merit for overlapping QADI next turn. Still, not enough merit. This play is correct.
>Norma: AEMT 10I MEAT +24 43
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHLPTW 6F WH.P +20 60
#note I didn't consider just WH(A) for 17. That seems better for my bingo and scoring potential, if it weren't for the fact that I am digging a bit more in the bag for an N. I was trying to hit NA(VIGA)TE! What would you play?
>Norma: ?EEORST 11C sTEREOS +67 110
#note M7 OERSTEd scores the best, but the coolest play by far is the insane I6 (P)OT(OM)EtERS!!! It has an anagram too... If Norma played a more defensive bingo, I might have been in trouble!
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDEELT 10A BLEATED +76 136
#note I didn't know TABLE(T)ED. If I had to find it I would have, and I think I would have played it. Otherwise my backup plan is K5 LE(VIGA)TED for 56. I didn't realize I was going for LE(V)IGA)TE too last turn!
>Norma: AEKN H11 .AKEN +30 140
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIIMRU A8 IM.UE +30 166
#note I saw 5H (Q)UIRE, but it seemed right to keep controlling the scoring spots while I am still in the game. Quackle suggests playing my R for 3 more points with IM(B)RUE or ER(B)IUM. Didn't consider that, seems a bit better. 
>Norma: CDER D8 CR..ED +24 164
>Joshua_Sokol: GHIIIRR 15D HIRI.G +14 180
>Norma: FIN B6 FIN +16 180
>Joshua_Sokol: BILORXZ B12 LOX +22 202
#note Damn it! I missed I2 OXLI(P). I also realized after playing that I should have considered ZI(P) I4 a bit longer. If she overlaps, I have the X to reoverlap, and I have two shots at drawing an A for 8K (I)XORA next turn. I didn't want to play BLI(P) since ZORX left me quite inflexible, but apparently that won't be a problem. 
>Norma: AAAEILO A14 AA +15 195
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BIORVZ F9 V..B +9 211
#note I missed BORZOI! That's 83 at A1. This is bad.
>Norma: DIOT 8K .DIOT +24 219
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEIORZ O8 .RIAZOlE +128 339
#note ugh, I felt really dumb when this happened
>Norma: GO 13M GO. +8 227
>Joshua_Sokol: IJNPRSU M4 PUNJ. +22 361
#note Vowels were getting scarce, so I decided to make the play that kept one. I chose this over 15L JUP(E) to keep fewer consonants. For spread, 5H (Q)UIP definitely trumps all, but I wanted the win.
>Norma: LU 5K UL. +6 233
>Joshua_Sokol: EINORSS K7 ....S +18 379
#note I should play the O for 6 more points. Especially since it prevents just about every scenario where Norma can win (by 2 bingos back-to-back). If she gets a miracle bingo now, I don't have perfect information about her rack, so I may screw up. Otherwise I can set my S up with NI(P) I4.
>Norma: AO G6 .AO +13 246
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNORS I4 NI. +16 395
#note Unnecessary fish again, but this time it's fine.
>Norma: CFNTTUY 4I .U +2 248
>Joshua_Sokol: EELORST C1 SOLERET +74 469
#note I didn't see any 3x3s she could have, but if she has something for like 200 I can lose!
>Norma: ACENRTY 1C .CANTY +42 290
#note Turns out ANCESTRY would have been playable if the S was two spots to the right... Wow! This is the number one endgame play.
>Joshua_Sokol: FWY 4B Y.W +18 487
#note Not F(E)W or F(E)Y because they give her FEWER and FEYER for one more than her next best play!
>Norma: ER 7E RE.. +10 300
>Norma:  (F) +8 308
