>Elouise: BFI 8G FIB +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: BSTUVWZ H7 W.Z +15 15
#note Would not play this against an expert, as it leaves me quite vulnerable if they are able to score with vowels or with an S of their own. Even if they cannot I am in trouble for next turn. The correct play would be to keept ST, but I would probably keep the Z too, stylistically. 
>Elouise: AO I7 O.A +25 41
#note was worried about that, but her having OA isn't that likely that I should have forgone WIZ.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABNSTUV J3 VAUNTS +26 41
#note Hopefully (OBA)H* will come into play, I was thinking. I decided to blow my rack up instead of exchanging here, keeping ANST, as I shouldn't rely on a bingo, especially since often the bingos I will draw open up 3x3s.
>Elouise: ADI 3H DI.A +9 50
>Joshua_Sokol: BDNNOSS L1 BOND +29 70
#note keeping the extra S to score and control the board.
>Elouise: MU H1 MU. +18 68
>Joshua_Sokol: EEENRSS M2 ES +26 96
#note I didn't need to be worried about SERENES being phony here, as it's doubtful Elouise would have challenged. But I didn't know that. Playing it safe is always a good idea when there is much to risk against lower-rated opponents.
>Elouise: DW 5I W.D +14 82
>Joshua_Sokol: EENQRSV -QV +0 96
#note the bag punishes me for not knowing SERENES well enough. NERVES as a leave doesn't hit much, so I opted to maximize my chances, except keeping ERNS does that, not SNEER. Small mistake.
>Elouise: GLP 2F PL.G +16 98

>Elouise: DT 2K T..D +12 110
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIIOX 5D OX +38 208
#note I realized that although this kept things far more under control, (N)IXE would be my play if I was attempting to go for spread, which I should have been.
>Elouise: LT C3 T.L +16 126
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIIIS -EIII +0 208
#note Really drawing the good stuff here
>Elouise: AK 3E KA +25 151

#note ok, enough of that Q
>Elouise: IN 2A IN +17 168
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEHIRR 1L .RAE +24 283
>Elouise: ER 6C ER +9 177
>Joshua_Sokol: AHINRTY B6 YIRTH +41 324
#note much more defensive than HAIRY, but there is nothing to be defensive for. The pool is garbage.
>Elouise: AEL A7 LEA +19 196
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGGNUV C8 GEAN +19 343
#note Figured that despite it being highly unlikely I could successfully close this board down, I would attempt to close down part of the board in two turns. I was hoping to be able to play GUV overlapping GEAN here. I also longly considered just G4 (T)UG for 4 to keep my rack balanced and open nothing. That might be correct!
>Elouise: ITU D10 TUI +14 210
>Joshua_Sokol: GJMRUVY 7D YUM +15 358
#note Just swimming by, there are so many vowels left, hopefully she can give me a spot for the J. Perhaps I should allow her to draw consonants so as not to risk anything for myself? I could have considered keeping MRG or something.
>Elouise: CEHO 10I HOE +17 227
>Elouise: CEHO --  -17 210
#note Yes!
>Joshua_Sokol: FGIJORV 6F OF +13 371
#note have to block her H-bomb. I didn't realize YUM opened that up for her!
>Elouise: CEHO 10B ...CH +21 231
>Joshua_Sokol: GIJORRV 11F ORG +9 380
#note Exchange 7 would be a very good move here if it weren't for the fact that I probably won't draw a consonant if I do exchange! I figured I should just score and hope she gives me a spot for my J
>Elouise: EOO 6J .OO +6 237
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIIJRV G11 .AJ +18 398
#note oops, missed ORGIAC, saw only ORGIC. This wasn't a good play, but it was all I could come up with

>Joshua_Sokol: CIIPR 15E C.IR +18 430
#note Stupid, I stuck myself. I should have played 7L PI first, and I knew right after I hit the clock.
