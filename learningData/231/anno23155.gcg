#note Or JENNET, both options are close.

>Mack: AMORTTT 10E TOT +11 139
#note The K column plays seemed to give a lot of counterplays starting from L4 back, and also hooks (TOM-->ATOM, TOT-->STOT).

#note Definitely not doing 3K GAZAR considering how much Karl has been fishing over the last few turns.

#note I have a lot of options here, including this, M6 OX, 3K OXID, and K8 IXORA. I figured I might get an E for 15A EX, and worst comes to worst I could just drop the X at M7 next turn for 34, so chose this.
>Karl: BCKL K10 BL.CK +26 252
>Mack: ?INORTX 7M X. +34 296
#note This looks good, I'm almost guaranteed to draw a bingo on the bottom row and maybe a 9 from the IS or NO if Karls blocks the bottom row, which he probably will.
>Karl: EGLST 15G GELTS +32 284
>Mack: ?INOORT 14K .INO +16 312
#note Almost played ISOTRONIc* but wisely opted out of it. I mixed up ISOTONIC and ISOTROPIC. 
>Karl: EMU 15M EMU +21 305
>Mack: ??AEORT 10I RO. +13 325
#note There is one 9 here, ISOThERAl, which I actually saw but passed up. I didn't see any bingos Karl could have at H1 after ISOThERAl, but at this point in the tournament winning was much more important than spread, so I didn't want to take the chance that I missed one. It's very hard to imagine losing after ROB with both blanks on an inconducive board and up 20 points.

#note GELTS was overscored by 1, so the final score was reported as 371-346 (I went overtime by a minute).
