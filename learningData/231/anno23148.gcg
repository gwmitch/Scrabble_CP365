#note I saw neither of the front hooks for OKA - HOKA# and KOKA#. still safer than any other play.

#note his timing was excellent, preventing LASTBORN. Q likes taking a couple of extra points for BOR which I considered

#note I thought it was important to cover this spot and prevent peter from scoring at row 11 with one of the 5 Is remaining. I also considered PRENT# at 10B, but it leaves me down a tempo with no obvious way to catch up. The two alternatives Q proposes that I like are PARGET at K9, which loses the E but sets up a dangerous lane and flips 5 tiles looking for the blank or S; and PART at K9, which sets up PARTI# and possible -ING bingos. At the end of the day I think I stll pick RANG because the EPRT leave can bingo well on row 10 if Peter blocks the bottom-right corner somehow.

#note I can probably just fish off PU here, not sure why I was so eager to play from the P. I cut my bingo chances next turn form 33% to 22%.

>JD: CEPRUWW M3 W.W +18 310
#note especially painful is that I drew CWW - after a play of PUN last turn I would've been 2/3 to draw CROWNET with the same draw!

#note I didn't even see the UVAE# hook, but I think this or PICINE# might be my best play - PUIR# leaves me with only one lane on row 15, which peter can straightforwardly block. after PURINE or PICINE it seems impossible for him to block everything.

#note I wanted to get plays down quickly to force peter over on time - he went over by 2 minutes.

#note he's supposed to play MICHT# to go out. instead he went over on time
>JD: ILSV 8L V.S. +21 411
#note VISES at E4. didn't play too badly this game, but a couple of my mistakes were hugely costly (HANDCART setting up CENTRIST, failing to draw CROWNET because of YONT)
