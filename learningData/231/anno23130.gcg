>Jeffrey_Nelson: II -II +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFKOTV H4 FOVEA +30 30
#note First time I had the chance to play KOFTA, missed it. Definitely better, especially since Jeffrey is close and FOVEA only barely lowers his chances of a bingo.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: AHP I7 HAP +26 26
#note Gave him 4 more points, but at least this HAP gives a better board shape.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEKLOTV G3 KOB +23 53
#note How did I miss 9G KE(P)T? That seems like it should merit consideration at least, since his rack is probably still bingo-prone. I also chickened out of BOOKLET, but that doesn't really make much sense in this position. Don't want to give him floaters.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: ENNRSTU 10I STUNNER +70 96
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELNTV O3 LEVANTE. +86 139
#note Ack, didn't alphabetize AEELNTUV. EVENT(U)AL is 94 and therefore worth considering. LEVANTE(R) cuts Jeffrey's score by at least 10 points, though! Which route would you take. I can't judge as I didn't see EVENTUAL in game.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: IIII -IIII +0 96
>Joshua_Sokol: HMMNOOY L6 HOMO.YM +40 179
#note Noooo! Nowhere to play it as a natural! I was disappointed here...
>Jeffrey_Nelson: ILO M10 .OIL +17 113
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEINOQ M5 QI +16 195
#note He seemed close to a bingo again, so I thought it wise to get rid of my Q to maximize my flexibility for next turn. Not going to exchange it though, even though it would leave me off better. That's because at this score it's important to preserve my lead. K4 DIENE is worth considering, but I think that play isn't positionally correct given Jeffrey's two last plays scoring an average of 8.5 points. Perhaps DIENE would have been correct, but I did not consider it. There were three U's to come, after all.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: AFIILRT F5 AIRLIFT +75 188
#note Hmm
>Joshua_Sokol: DEENOTU E10 OUTED +21 216
#note putting myself into a vulnerable position by missing 5E T(ABO)OED!
>Jeffrey_Nelson: DEINRST 13B INS.RTED +74 262
>Joshua_Sokol: BEENTWY H11 WE.NY +36 252
#note Perhaps preserve the Y and play TW(E)EN. I didn't see 6N (HI)Y(A)! I think this was yet another mistake!
>Jeffrey_Nelson: CCOR K3 CROC +24 286
#note or not!
>Joshua_Sokol: BENORST O1 RE........ +39 291
>Joshua_Sokol: BENORST --  -39 252
#note He blocked B(ABO)ONS, but luckily I had this... oh, it's not good? I thought I had looked this up before, silly me :P
>Jeffrey_Nelson: ARW 3K .RAW. +20 306
>Joshua_Sokol: BENORST B10 BON.ER +28 280
#note My backup plan was to get him to set SORBENT up somewhere
>Jeffrey_Nelson: AE A14 AE +14 320
#note This does not bode well. He just played two tiles with both blanks out, for little.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEJSTZ 5E J...T +28 308
#note Good thing a lucky pull brings me back into it, slightly. Perhaps at least momentum is in my favor now, as I have much of the scoring power remaining in the pool.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: EIU J9 E.UI +8 328
#note OK, I definitely have something going for me here
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEGPSZ C9 ZEP +32 340
#note Definitely blocking his way out of his vowelly mess.
>Jeffrey_Nelson: AAGGILX N12 LAX +27 355
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADGISU O13 DUG +28 368
#note Seemed like a relatively uncomplicated endgame. I don't have to worry about drawing vowels, since he likely has most of them. Therefore DIG can't be better than DUG, as the U sucks. But it looks like it will be close!
>Jeffrey_Nelson: AEGGIIS D6 GIGA +19 374
#note I guess it wasn't supposed to be close. Luck definitely went my way this whole game, lost challenge or not.
