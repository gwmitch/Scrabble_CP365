>Siri_Tillekeratne: DEIJV 8D JIVED +48 48
#note I play pretty terrible this game too, but some weird stuff happens.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEISTY 7G YE +21 21
#note EEIST seems like one of the better 3-V 2-C leaves to have, plus YE scores more than EYE can anyways.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADGR 6G DRAG +21 69
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIKST 9H EKE +17 38
#note I didn't even look, I played EKE in about 20 seconds. This ends up being a really bad miss.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FI 10I IF +32 101
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMPSTT D8 .IMPEST +36 74
#note Ugh. I considered 11G PETTI. Then I debated if getting 9 more points for the S was worth it. I considered that this might get challenged as well. I also considered T(A)P, but I hated that I couldn't S-hook it. What about P(A)T for 13 instead which does set up an S-hook? Anyways I opted to just go for max score and hope to catch up without relying on a bingo. Sim says play off one T, because apparently EIMPST bingos with all 5 vowels + some other letters. That's a pretty high chance to bingo!
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EORT 11J TORE +14 115
>Matthew_Larocque: CDENTTT M8 DET.NT +16 90
#note At least play DETECT instead, geez. I just got excited when I saw DETENT because I was actually able to dump 5 letters and not open a 3x3 like NETTED does.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AB 8M .AB +18 133
>Matthew_Larocque: CCEGLOT N6 CO.L +14 104
#note I was so stumped on this play. I didn't know what I wanted to accomplish. I didn't know about DETENTE for one thing. I didn't know GELCOAT. I wanted to get rid of one C and the G, but not with a play like COG(S) because...well, maybe I should have played COG(S) anyways. With a rack this crappy I don't have a lot of options. I suppose even something like I3 GLO(A)T gets some action happening in the upper region. CO(A)L doesn't help me at all.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AELLRSU 14G ALLURES +67 200
#note I am so screwed.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEFGOT H12 GO.F +30 134
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ENY E10 YEN +29 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEINT E4 ACIN. +14 148
#note I blanked on MYC!!! E(V)ICT is 43. I realized that I was in a dire situation here, so I made this sad play to try and open up top.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: MP I5 M.P +21 250
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINOT C13 OE +10 158
>Siri_Tillekeratne: Q 9C Q. +21 271
#note Siri plays this in like 2 seconds. Although I am down by 113, there are 2 blanks left. Spoiler: I draw one blank, but I don't get to use it for a bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEINST K2 ENTASIA +71 229
#note Pretty much the flukiest draw I could have asked for. I got the S, and out of 73 TISANE words, 6 of them have the S in the third-to-last position, 7 in the second-to-last position.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BI J2 BI +22 293
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNOVZ 13F AZ. +43 272
#note I'm starting to rush my plays here so I don't go over on time. I miss playing Z(O)A instead for 47. I could also play ZONA for 50, but that could backfire.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GOO 1H GOO +17 310
>Matthew_Larocque: EHNOVW B13 WHO +36 308
#note These final racks were incomplete because I was under too much pressure.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AX L4 AX +31 341

>Siri_Tillekeratne: DRU 12K RU. +12 353

#note !
>Matthew_Larocque: AINUVW D1 VAIN +26 359
#note Siri makes an untimely error, and I lead in this game for the first time!
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DRU 2A DUR. +10 351
#note I'm really lucky Siri can't score any points.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILOTUW A8 OUtWIT +34 393
#note I may have played OUTWIT, but I don't think I actually played like I outwitted anyone!
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?INRRS 1A IN +17 368
#note Siri can go out here two ways, or find a semi-tricky play that scores 23.
>Matthew_Larocque: L 15A L. +6 399
#note Missed the 9 point spot.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (?RRS) +6 405
#note I was actually scored as 410, and then still lost 10 because I still went overtime. I still have no idea how I won this game.
