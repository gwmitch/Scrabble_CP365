>Evans_Clinchy: EEOPQRX 8H EXPO +26 26
>Jesse_Day: BENNRSS L4 BRENS +31 31
#note JD: hrm, I missed the immediate cheap extensions to EXPOSERS, but it's actually a dead heat on a sim between that and my play. I'm probably OK with sacrificing the 23 points and bingoing a lot faster.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIINOQR M3 QI +26 52
>Jesse_Day: AIMNNSU 5K U.N +18 49
#note JD: took me a long time to persuade myself I wasn't missing anything. no bingos or anything, and I leave myself 60% to bingo next turn.
>Evans_Clinchy: EINOORT J2 INOTRO.E +68 120
>Jesse_Day: AIMNRST 10D MARTINS +76 125
>Evans_Clinchy: AILPTTV E5 TALIP.T +36 156
#note JD: I challenged to give Evans an extra 5
>Jesse_Day: HOW F4 HOW +32 157
#note JD: difficult choice. considered COWISH on this turn, but that gives away my good assets on an open board. should really just play WO or OW and preserve the CEHIS synergy, poor decision (per turn average jumps from 51 to 60! points per turn by keeping the H).
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGGMOV 8A AGAM. +33 189
#note JD: challenged again, +5 to evans
>Jesse_Day: CDEIORS 12C DISCOER +82 239
>Evans_Clinchy: ?GINOVZ 8H .....ING +54 243
#note EC: Surprised that ZOL 7C sims better than this. EXPOSING is 7 points more, it opens a new bingo line, and it retains the tiles to play ZOL next turn anyway! What's the downside?
>Jesse_Day: AHLNUWY 7C HU.L +34 273
#note JD: was pretty happy with this play but didn't know HULLY# for 8 extra points. actually, this functions as a brilliant setup for my remaining letters - I now have AWNY at G4 for 46, although that would open a triple-word score.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?CEKOVZ N6 ZO.K +37 280
>Jesse_Day: AFNSUWY B6 WA.YU +30 303
#note JD: because I didn't know HULLY# I miss FAWNY for 54 which I created for myself!
>Evans_Clinchy: ??CEEVV 6D V.. +17 297
#note JD: ooh, Evans had EVINCIVE on this rack. tough find.
EC: I don't think I even knew that word. I spent several minutes staring at EVICTIVE* and EVECTIVE* - had a really tough time convincing myself that neither was good. Didn't think of the actual bingo.
>Jesse_Day: AEFFGNS A10 GAFFES +54 357
>Evans_Clinchy: ??CEEEV 13H dECEiVE +76 373
#note JD: SCREEVED/R/S is 86 (well, 91 because I would certainly have challenged)
EC: Ugh, now that one I definitely knew! What a miss.
>Jesse_Day: AEIILLN N2 LI +15 372
#note the game situation looked pretty poor, but I have the last N and there are no Ss so I can now try to hit column O whenever I want for the rest of the game, potentially waiting until I draw a huge play. He can block with JA/JO or playing up from the Z, but it may not be easy for him to block in general. I think that creating this threat has to be better than any of my alternatives, although GILA at O8 isn't a bad idea to block some of the big plays hooking DECEIVE.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEIRTY C12 .EY +14 387
#note JD: evans didn't see EYRIE on this turn for 47! he was focused on trying to contain bingo threats and draw one of his own.
EC: Yeah, I tunnelled in on blocking his bingos and keeping a balanced leave for myself. Didn't even look for EYRIE-type plays, boneheadedly. I thought I'd be OK as long as I mucked things up and retained a bit of a lead, but that was very very wrong.
>Jesse_Day: AADEILN O12 IDEA +30 402
#note JD: again, no way I'm touching column O on this turn. he clearly didn't have JO last turn, and he also turned over few tiles so he's unlikely to have drawn it on his last draw. the only superior play to IDEA is ALDEA# which I didn't know, giving me one extra tile to flip over in search of a high scoring play.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIRRT 7H RE. +16 403
#note JD: I think he has to either create a bingo lane or block column O - RIVE at M11 setting up RIVER looks really strong. otherwise I will just outrun him by scoring, although I didn't know THOWL# which does give him a half-decent bingo lane.
EC: I thought about those things. None of the bingo setups looked appealing, since the pool is oddly clunky and any fish felt likely to miss. Blocking the Q seemed difficult since I don't have a letter that hooks QI, but I overlooked (BI)ER. Maybe you're right that RIVE is my best shot. Ugh, this is a gross position. I didn't realize at the time how much trouble I was in.
>Jesse_Day: ABDLNTU O1 BANTU +38 440
#note JD: wins 35/36 endgames, losing only to ODORATE#/THOWL#
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIJORT G3 RET +12 415
#note JD: best endgame is starting with JIAO L12 and RITE/THOWL to go out, 9 points better than his sequence.
>Jesse_Day: DDLO D12 .DOL +14 454
#note JD: he has two spots for JIAO, so no point in blocking.
>Evans_Clinchy: AIJO 2E JIAO +17 432
>Evans_Clinchy:  (D) +4 436
