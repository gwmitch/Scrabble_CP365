#note This seemed worth playing over exchanging. Quackle actually wants me to play EVItE burning the blank, but there's no way I'd play that.

>Mack: ?EEIIOX 14E EX +27 96
#note Again, I wasn't happy with this play, but it is still better than exchanging.

#note I saw the bingos, but if I bingo for 70 and Matt gets a 45 point play here I'm still down 80 with a random rack, whereas if I take this now I'll probably be down 100 or so with a blank in hand after Matt's next play, a much more promising situation.
>Matt: EKORW 12I WORKE. +28 253
>Mack: ?ABDTYZ O1 BYZAnT +62 218
#note With bingo lanes becoming scarce, it seemed correct to burn the blank now and score big as opposed to taking 4J DOZY. Quackle agrees.
>Matt: AANS 13L ANSA +27 280
>Mack: ?DEILRT 2H TREnDIL. +76 294
#note Lucky draw keeps me in the game here.

>Mack: GJNPPRT J10 PR.NG +18 312
#note This seems like my best choice here. I'm not too concerned about opening up QIS at 15H for him since he has it at 14J anyway, and I'll almost certainly lose regardless if he has it. Similarly, if I get the Q I'm losing 100%, so I basically have to make this play and hope he gets the Q but has to play it for cheap at M1 or G5.
>Matt: GOOS 15G GOOS +24 339
>Mack: AEJOPRT 5J J.TE +11 323
#note There are a few plays that win by a couple more points, such as POOJA 4I and JATO 3G followed by 4K OPERA after Matt plays TORQUE, but this gets the job done. I had scored BYZAnT as 61 instead of 62, so at the time I thought I won by 1, but we recounted and found the error, so I ultimately won by 2.
