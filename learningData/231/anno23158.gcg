#note Considered KYLIN to save the S, but since HEM takes an E anyway, it didn't seem that valuable, especially with 3 more unseen. This looks good.

#note Was waffling between this and the D11 placement. The alternative would have worked out much better, but neither play looks materially better than the other positionally.

#note I didn't consider plays making BOOZE, but I like this to unload the extra consonant. Even though the BOOZE plays block the B column, they'll still give Joe another floater to bingo through, but at this point Joe may very well not need to bingo to win anyway.

>Mack: AABDLOO 12C AB +25 354
#note Touch call here between this and emptying the bag with something like B6 BOA. The problem with BOA is that Joe can still bingo through the R on row 1, and may very well be able to outrun me with a play like L3 SADES. With AB, I go up 34 points so I have a much better chance of winning if Joe doesn't bingo than after BOA. BOA would have worked out better in this scneario (though I'd have still lost after L3 SANES), but I'm fine with AB.
