>Evans_Clinchy: AEHIPRT -H +0 0
#note Close call between this and a short opening like HIP. The PIRATE bingo stem hits a seven with any one of ACDELMNPRSTVW?, so it's a 58/93 shot, which is pretty good. The drawback is that if I hit something gross like I, O or U, I might have a really low-scoring turn. It's a volatile decision. Sim thinks HIP is about 1.5 points better than trading.

>Evans_Clinchy: NOORSTT 3J ONTO +13 379
#note Risky to make a play keeping three consonants like this... I could be in serious trouble with the wrong draw. After poring over some sim results, just NOT/NY for 9 points looks like the safer option.
>Komol_Panyasoponlert: CEINZ 6H .EZINC +38 406
#note A great play by Komol to block up the board and prevent me from bingoing with a risky tile pool unseen. It worked - I had LUNARIST for the win ready to go down. My heart was racing when he first put down DEZINC in line 5, but he wisely spotted the LUNARIST/LUNARIES possibilities (among other things I could have there) and blocked them.
>Evans_Clinchy: AINRSTU 4J NU +10 389
#note Ugh. Just ran out of time. With a few seconds left, I slapped this down and hoped STAIR/DEZINCS next turn would be enough to win. Wasn't able to count and figure out that it lost by 1. The actual best play is NAIRU underlapping ONTO, which scores 24 and beautifully sets up UTS for 26 and out. That wins easily. I had no time to find it.

>Evans_Clinchy: AIRST N6 STAIR +30 419
#note Heartbreaking loss. Gave away a nickel, missed an 86-pointer, had a phony challenged off, blew the endgame under time pressure, lost by a point. Blech.
