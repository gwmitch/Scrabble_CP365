#note I overdrew, Jason turned over AGR, threw the R back, correctly. This is like a 5-point mistake! :)

But Jason took over 5 minutes here. I think I would play PADI D1, especially knowing that my opponent holds AG, which seems to revolve around the top left.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEEGHI D1 HEBE +36 150
#note I thought perhaps I should play GIBE instead because Jason's range seems to be able to hit the H for easy points, and because Jason knows I am leaving AG. Probably a mistake to play this, given the circumstances. But that's just the collateral damage from overdrawing.

>Joshua_Sokol: AAEGINQ F2 GEAN +27 177
#note This, however, is a real mistake. 10A (N)IQAA(B) is a tough find! I also considered B1 (Y)AGI, but he might smell my setup, and so I didn't think the 11 points was worth sacrificing. Probably wrong about that.

#note he played 
>Joshua_Sokol: AINOQTU J2 QUOTA +42 219
#note POX blocked two plays probably superior than this one, B1 (Y)ANQUI keeping OT and QUI(Z) keeping NOTA. I don't want to keep an I here, there are 7 unseen and Jason doesn't have more than one, and often has none after his play of G(O)X

>Joshua_Sokol: ?DDIRRU 3M DUI +18 267
#note GENITOR blocked RUDDIER. Going to have to work for this win, it seems. I played this, since Jason has so much scoring power if I leave everything to him, which translates into a bingo next turn not being enough. Perhaps I am overanalyzing this position, but it seems that it is in my best interest to score as much as possible and prevent Jason from getting easy points, to the detriment of my rack leave. Leaving open the triple-triple for later might backfire, though, since there are three eses to come!

#note Jason chickens out of (S)AVORIES, luckily for me.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEORRW 15H WED +41 308
#note Now I am in bad shape, as a bingo won't get me anywhere close to victory. I have to bite the bullet and score as much as possible to remain in contention.

Side note, I briefly considered whether or not (TI)REDWORk was valid.
