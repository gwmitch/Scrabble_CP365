#note I should probably just play AUGITE, but I'm happy to counter-exchange here.
>Bernard: II -II +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEFLRT -F +0 0
#note Now an exchange is definitely merited. And this is the best of the lot.
>Bernard: ADHNO H4 HONDA +26 26
>Joshua_Sokol: ACELRTZ 4H .AZEL +34 34
#note Got distracted here and couldn't see any plays. C(O)LZA is standard here, and definitely correct.
>Bernard: DXY K3 D.XY +30 56
>Joshua_Sokol: CEELRTU 7A LECTURE. +65 99
#note I was unfamiliar with RELUCE(N)T, which is significantly better than this.
>Bernard: AETV A5 VA.ET +24 80
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIORTU J4 .OA +30 129
#note Interestingly, L1 AIO(L)I is simming best here. I guess because it scores more than anything else besides the play I made. I really just played ZOA because I was surprised at how much is scored! Otherwise this is yet another mistake.
>Bernard: FFGINU C7 .UFFING +40 120
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIIRTU 12B U.TIdIER +66 195
#note Probably wrong because of overlap/comeback bingo potential.
