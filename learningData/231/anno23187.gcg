>Austin_Shin: ADEELST 8C DELATES +68 68
>Evans_Clinchy: BEGKRUY F6 BE.KY +28 28
#note This wins the sim. It scores nicely without offering any dangerous counterplays.
>Austin_Shin: AEIM E10 AMIE +17 85
>Evans_Clinchy: BFGIRUW 13B FIR.BUG +28 56
#note I had an impulse here to unload as much of the clunky rack as possible, but that's not necessary. FUB D10 scores 37, which is a lot, and GIRW is a not-that-terrible leave.
>Austin_Shin: AEIMN H10 ENI.MA +30 115
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIORVW D4 AVOW.D +26 82
#note Either this, WAIVODE in the same spot, or DROW D12 for the decent score/leave. I didn't mind playing for an open board and more turnover, so this felt right to me.
>Austin_Shin: JP 15G J.P +12 127

>Evans_Clinchy: IOORSST I13 SO. +25 139
#note Wow, there is a bingo with these seven letters. Complete fail.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACGLNTV 2F CL.NG +18 314
#note With a bad rack and a bingo-sized lead, I thought it made sense to start blocking things up. Quackle says it's hard to pass up the 32 points for CLIFT B10. Hmm, not sure about that.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?EENRST 4D .pER.ENTS +67 467
#note This is not the best play but I have a tie so my spread doesn't matter and I felt like showing off.
>Austin_Shin: ADEINOR 3G A.I +13 276
>Evans_Clinchy: CITTXZ L1 ZIT. +23 490
#note Best is TIZ K4 to avoid giving him the easy ZONE/ZERO comebacks.
>Austin_Shin: DENOR B2 DRONE +23 299
#note I think Austin just wanted to get this game over with, and I can't blame him.
