#note Even for 28 points, GUNK feels wrong to me. Why give up the QU synergy? I loved this leave and also felt like BONG was decent defensively.

>Evans_Clinchy: AIIMORV 4L MIRV +34 209
#note MOVIE is definitely better despite the point sacrifice. Keeping AIR is far better than AIO.

>Cameron_Farlow: EJ 6F JE. +31 214
>Evans_Clinchy: ACEOTTU E3 OUTACT +27 262
#note OUTRACE N1 makes a bunch of overlaps and scores 42. I missed it, but at least with OUTACT I can keep the board more closed without giving back an easy line for an 80+ bingo.
>Cameron_Farlow: FIILM D1 FILMI +40 254
>Evans_Clinchy: EEGHORY 14B HYE +35 297
#note Saw FROGEYE and considered it strongly, but I figured giving back an X-bomb was an easy way to blow this game. This felt safer to me.

>Evans_Clinchy: AELNPST 14G ..P +14 355
#note Best for sure. Takes an ever-so-slight lead, leaves a tile in the bag and sets up a bingo line that only I can use - the bag includes EIIU for ELANETS/EASTLIN/ELUANTS, so there's a 4/9 chance I have a bingo in line 15 next turn.
>Cameron_Farlow: EINSX C5 NIXES +24 375
>Evans_Clinchy: AELNSTW 9L AWL +15 370
#note Best! This blocks his only outplay (UNI/YU) and sets up a high-scoring spot to go out with NEST. And I found it with seconds on my clock! Woot.
>Cameron_Farlow: INU N1 NU +12 387
>Evans_Clinchy: ENST O7 NEST +19 389
#note Didn't have time to look for STEN B5, which scores 6 extra. Fortunately I didn't need it. Survived a close one!
