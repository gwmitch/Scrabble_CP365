>Jonathan_Lindh: DIINTWX 8G WIND +16 16
#note Jumpman Jon's Best Game of 2016: 6th best play! I think it's a tossup between this and DIXIT. My play sacrifices 14 but keeps the X for overlapping. Eh, DIXIT is probably better but mine is the best of the non-DIXIT plays. -7.5 says Q.
>Erik_Eisner: ANUY K8 YUAN +26 26
#note Why do people always have the hooks when I put 4 letter words at G8?
>Jonathan_Lindh: IIMRSTX J10 MIXT +31 47
#note 2nd best play! I went back and forth between MIX and MIXT but Q likes MIX best. Quackle says -4.2. I think it's closer than that.
>Erik_Eisner: ?AENRTU I11 TAU +19 45
#note Erik needed to do TAUT!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIORSZ H12 ZORI +101 148
#note Best play! Erik took out the T for EROTIZES, but left me with something even better that allows me to keep EES. Big game changer!
>Erik_Eisner: GRR L11 GRR +13 58
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEENOPS 7H PEE +16 164
#note 2nd best play! 7G OPE is best and scores 20. I agree. I also like what OPE does to the board more than PEE. -3
>Erik_Eisner: ??DDILO I6 L..D +7 65
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEINOSS M5 ONSIDES +67 231
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEINOSS --  -67 164
#note I should know better than to attempt a sports-related phony against Erik. There aren't any bingos in this rack and the best play is apparently F9 SO. Nothing really good to do here. I also thought ONSIDES* was good too. No. Just OFFSIDES.
>Erik_Eisner: EJST M8 JETS +18 83
#note I think Erik has a blank and multiple S's.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEINOSS 8M .IN +30 194
#note Best play! Given what Erik had JOE in the same spot may have been better but my play is better equity wise.
>Erik_Eisner: ?AIORRS O3 ROARI.gS +58 141
#note Tied for 8th best play for Erik! GARRISON and ROSARIAN at O1 for 74 are best. They also block my ADENOSIS at N2 for 74 as does ROARINGS.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADENOSS 15D ANOD.SES +60 254
#note Tied for best play! Thankfully I have this. ADONISES and ADENOSIS are the other two. Mine is new.
>Erik_Eisner: EGLNNQV -  +0 141
#note Erik unsuccessfully challenges.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEMORU 14D DUM +27 281
#note 8th best play! Yeah I did see ROAMED at 14A and came very close to playing it, but I didn't like the R at that spot with a blank out because it risks a triple triple and I frequently get triple tripled on. -9.5 according to Q but I'm fine with my play.
>Erik_Eisner: AQT N2 QAT +28 169
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGNOR 9A oREGANO +65 346
#note Best play! This and mARENGO in the same spot are the only bingos surprisngly. I wonder if mARENGO is marginally more defensive. I'm not sure. I just am not interested in being triple tripled on.
>Erik_Eisner: GKO A7 GO.K +24 193
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEILLO 13C COLE +24 370
#note OOF!!! This game was going really well until this miss. D4 COLLEGIA was 74 and I think I draw the challenge. And I knew COLLEGIA as well! This is the 2nd best play but an eye popping -51.4 equity loss.
>Erik_Eisner: IIPT B4 TIPI +15 208
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEHILT 4B .ITHABLE +78 448
#note Best play! Bailed out by the tile gods and some good anagramming which was badly missing the last turn.
>Erik_Eisner: ABEFIOW -  +0 208
#note Erik had to challenge. The game is now over.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILVVY H1 VEA.Y +33 481
#note Best play!
>Erik_Eisner: CEF E8 F.CE +18 226
>Jonathan_Lindh: BFILOUV 3C BIO +25 506
#note Q likes BIOFUEL for 20 but that leaves a high risk of being V stick. My play is 5th best according to Q and -6.7 but I'm not sure it's that bad given Quackle's track record of evaluating endgames in equity mode. I should switch to the 5 min championship player to evaluate these games.
>Erik_Eisner: HNO 2B NOH +23 249
>Jonathan_Lindh: FLUVW C7 FL.W +25 531
#note I think this is best. 3H AWFUL is AWFUL because I get V stuck! Mine scores one more and I can ditch the V is Erik isn't tracking well enough.
>Erik_Eisner: AEEE 1A AE +8 257
#note He wasn't. M3 EAR is his play to force the V stick.
>Jonathan_Lindh: UV 3M V.. +12 543
>Erik_Eisner: EE 1H .EE +6 263
#note 2nd best play for Erik! 10E CEE is 17. -11 for Erik.
>Erik_Eisner:  (U) +2 265
#note High game of the year although -75.6 equity is blah! 51.4 of the equity came off of the COLLEGIA miss. Other than that, well played game on my part!
