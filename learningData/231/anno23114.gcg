>Howard_Warner: EHT 7I HET +23 23
>Evans_Clinchy: CIIMORY 6H ICY +38 78
#note MO(TO)RIC is a cool play I missed, but this sims better anyway. Stronger defense.
>Howard_Warner: IKP K7 ..PIK +22 45
#note Not a word! A creative mashup of TUPIK and GOPIK, I guess.
>Evans_Clinchy: IMMNORR G4 MORN +16 94
#note Might as well take the 4 extra points with NORM L10. They're about the same defensively despite the extra hooks (NORMS and NORMA).

#note Ooh, AIKONA. That is better.
>Howard_Warner: DEEINST D7 DESTINE +71 162
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEINO E10 ODEA +22 181
#note Whoa, INDE(X)E(S) for 41 is sweet.

>Howard_Warner: EFLOSSU --  -84 230
#note I thought FLOUSES was bad, but I typed in FLOUSES/TOPIKS at the challenge computer just to mess with him. Yay for accidentally getting free turns?
>Evans_Clinchy: ACEIILN F9 ICE +26 231
>Howard_Warner: EFLOSSU M1 FLOUSES +85 315
#note ...oh oops guess I should have blocked this

>Howard_Warner: DIV K3 VID +22 337
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGILNZ C11 NAZE +58 331
#note Sim prefers ZA by a little bit, which I'm unsure about. It seems really risky - putting all your eggs in the "bingo soon" basket can easily backfire. NAZE is 12 extra points and gives me the chance to outrun him in scenarios where I don't get a bingo down.

>Evans_Clinchy: AGILNNT N2 INGAN +35 366
>Howard_Warner: ALOR H11 .AROL +24 382
>Evans_Clinchy: ABGLOTY 2A BOGY +28 394
#note There's no real way to block here, especially since I'm behind by 16 and need to keep scoring. The best strategy is just to pray that he got screwed by a WU draw, score points and turn over a lot of tiles so I can threaten an out next turn. BOGY works somewhat, but I missed the even better choice - OTALGY O6. That's 47 percent to win; this is 31.
>Howard_Warner: ABEOTUW 1A OW +32 414
#note Lucky - he did indeed draw the ugly WU combo, leaving the blank in the bag for me.
