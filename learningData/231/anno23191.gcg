#note -17 ... i really needed to find BONDMAID here. i missed BIRDMAN too but i'm not sure if that was better than my play. also, MIND is probably better because of -ISM bingos, but the best 4-tile play here is IAMB. ugh.

#note very unlucky to draw the blank here. i missed M'LADIS but i wasn't sure i want to play that. bingoing doesn't sim well; 2L AVID is by far my best shot. -2.5 but probably more. i need to open a lane.

#note i honestly just ran out of ideas. i don't know how to open the board and still score enough. my hope was a 9 through whatever he blocks the R with, or something. it's not clear what i should do here at all. quackle likes DODGY D8 the best but no. he just has to play AE or something like that. maybe NUG G9, upon further thought, actually, and then i have to find DOYLIES/JOYRIDER if i draw the E, but that still won't be enough to win most likely.

#note this, somehow, has the highest chance of winning? i could also play TARE.
