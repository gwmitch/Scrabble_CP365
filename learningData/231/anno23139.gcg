>Jonathan_Lindh: AHLLNOT 8D HALLO +24 24
#note 2nd best play! 8D HALLOT is apparently best. This is fine too. I recall not being sure on HALLOT. -1.3
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADEEEII -IIEE +0 0
#note Exchange 4. Not actual rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EENSTTU F2 UNSETT.E +62 86
#note Best play! This or F8 LUNETTES. I think this is a little saver than that!
>Harriette_Lakernick: EJKO 4B JOKE. +32 32
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADEFNR 5C FAR. +29 115
#note 9th best play! If I knew Harriette's next move, I do 5D AFEARD. There are a lot of plays that sim very close together. I wanted to keep a nice leave and a D for UNSETTLED. This was -4.7 to Quackle.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EGORSTT H3 GROTT.ES +60 92
#note Frowny face. And best play for Harriette!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEENO 10C ANODE. +25 140
#note 3rd best play! I has the right idea but 10D AEDES for 24 is a little better because it keeps a consonant. 2nd best play is B7 EDENTATE for 23 keeping an O which no one other than a computer or Nigel Richards would see. This is -2.9 to Quackle but this is fine.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ITU 11C TUI +14 106
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEELUV 12D BLUE +25 165
#note 2nd best play! The hard to see BATEAU at C9 is #1 but mine scores 3 more. Quackle says -.5 but it's really a tossup and I am fine with my play. 
>Harriette_Lakernick: CEILMNW -CEIL +0 106
#note Harriette exchanged. 3 or 4 I think.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIMRVV H12 RAVE +32 197
#note 5th best play! I considered Quackle's best 9A VAV, but didn't like giving up 9 points and slotting the V in a triple lane. Quackle likes RIVE in this same spot as 2nd best which I probably do on a do over. Too many I's out. -6.2 to VAV and -1.3 to RIVE.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EGIMNOW 14F WI.E +18 124
#note This is why I don't like VAV. WIVE would be 30 if I did Quackle's suggestion.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGIMOTV J11 VOID +28 225
#note Best play! I was surprised Quackle approved of this!
>Harriette_Lakernick: ??AIINR 3H .RAINIer +66 190
#note Tied for best play with 4 other bingos! I like GRAINITIC and GRAINING more than this one because comebacks are harder. These are listed at the top of the 66 point bingos, possibly for this reason.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GMOPTWZ O1 WO.M +33 258
#note Quackle says 2nd best play but I like saving the Z and trying for a 60+ point Z play at J2. Quackle says -1.6 but I disagree. I like mine best.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADEHY 5K HEADY +36 226
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGMOPTZ 2J ZA +64 322
#note 3rd best play! Quackle likes going vowelless here and going with AZO or ZOA for 67. I considered these plays, but wanted to keep a vowel. Quackle says -1.7 but once again I disagree.
>Harriette_Lakernick: FIL 6J FIL +21 247
>Jonathan_Lindh: GGMOPTX N1 OP. +21 343
#note This is bad. Forgot about HALLOO for OX I8 for 43. Nothing else is worth considering. -20.7
>Harriette_Lakernick: Q C9 Q.. +22 269
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGGMTX 4H .EX +31 374
#note 2nd best play! I like keeping the board completely shut for the sure win. Quackle says -1.3 but once again, I prefer my play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: DEIINPY 11J .INY +20 289
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGGMST 10K GEM +18 392
#note 11th best play! I don't like Quackle's best, M11 YEGG for 18 but 13H AMICES is BEAUTIFUL. Hard to see. Mine is Ok but not great. However, my play does set up SC_ _ 4 letter words which I feel makes it 2nd to AMICES. Maybe this is best after all contrary to what Quackle says. -7.5
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINRSU 15A INSURE +26 315
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABCGOST 12L SCAB +38 430
#note Best play! I can go out with GOT now.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ACDINPR O8 CARI. +27 342
>Harriette_Lakernick: ACDINPR --  -27 315
#note Harriette's best play is O10 RIBAND for 27. She confused this with CAROB. I challenged very quickly.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GOT 6A GOT +12 442
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ACDINPR) +24 466
#note Only serious mistake was the OX/HALLOO miss. Other than that, a lot of judgement calls in which I like my own judgement better than Quackle's. Probably my best played game of the afternoon.
