#note "A veteran play," Dan quipped.
>Dan_Stock: INOQU K5 QUINO. +30 51
#note Dan did the fakeout, pretending like he was about to put an S down, and stopped.
>Jason: ?EILOPT M3 LEPIdOT. +70 162
#note POETLIk(E) is another good option ... didn't know it.
>Dan_Stock: HO 8M .OH +18 69
>Jason: DEELMOR N4 MED +25 187
#note Chickened out on MODEL(L)ER. Ugh. When will I grow stones?
>Dan_Stock: ?EGILOR 11A GLORIEs +67 136
>Jason: DEIILOR O1 OILED +33 220
#note (G)EOID was tempting, but Duck says this is right.
>Dan_Stock: ALYZ A11 .LAZY +57 193
#note Wishing I'd played GEOID... (Scored as 54.)

>Dan_Stock: AEIMNRS O8 .ARMINES +92 285
#note I held, neither this, AEHIMNR or AEHIMNRS looking familiar right away. Remembering MARINE's anamonic helped, though. "There a problem with this?" Dan asked in the post-mortem. "Yeah, the problem is that Jason hasn't reviewed his high-prob bingos in a while and it didn't look right at first," I said.
>Jason: AEEIRTU N11 EAU +11 259
>Dan_Stock: OS 11K SO +38 323
#note That was inevitable.
>Jason: EIORTTT 1L OTT. +5 264
#note I didn't think Dan would go for TROTTIER*.

#note Even with Dan having three fewer points than we thought, bingoing is a necessity (briefly considered FEH at 1E, but having the case E and only five unseen vowels (plus the S-setup being easily blocked) put the kibosh on that idea. Was happy to see I had all the hooks.
>Dan_Stock: ABU H2 .ABU +14 399
#note Uh-oh, down to three unseen vowels. And you've got to assume at least one of those is on Dan's rack.
>Jason: DEGHRSW 9C H.W +13 350
#note When a W draw doesn't hurt. AACC available for CADGERS was my thought as I tried to will the right tiles out of the bag.
>Dan_Stock: F 4L F... +18 417
>Jason: CDEGORS 6B CODGERS +76 426
#note I is luckbox!
>Dan_Stock: ACDKNXY C2 KAYN.D +32 449
#note Props to Dan for the poker face, playing this almost casually. He told me it was indeed a ridiculous phony after the clock was neutralized. Like I told him, a *really* good player would've challenged to rack up spread. I am not that. As Chuck said after the tourney when Dan told him the story: "No 1900 player should let KAYNOD* go!" True enough. :)
