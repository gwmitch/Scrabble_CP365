>Winter: EFHILOS 7F OF +20 20
#note Decide she's going to get the counterplay regardless of OF or FOH, so I decide, after thousands of Quackled games, that it would like to keep the H. But I get it wrong.
>Pat_Gaboury: ADVY 6C DAVY +33 59
#note This is where it starts.

>Winter: ?EJORTT 10A JOTTERs +74 226
#note Almost decided against the bingo, but I couldn't pull the trigger and risk not being able to bingo, the way she was scoring.

#note Ordinarily would keep a vowel, but lots of Is in the bag.
>Pat_Gaboury: R M13 R. +8 220
>Winter: AEENQSU M6 QUEAN +24 330
#note This  cost me the game, but I had good reasons for not playing for 50. After her play, I assume she has a good rack, probably the blank, and don't want to get zinged with the Q and then have her bingo, or god forbid the 3x3 (unlikely). I thought my lead was enough to survive a bingo (it was, but not two).

>Pat_Gaboury: AGINORT 2B A.ORTING +76 296
#note I expected a bingo, but I didn't expect her to hit the DWS, and I hoped for a better counterplay. AND I EXPECTED THE BLANK TO COME OUT. Now that it's still in bag, I'm in trouble.
>Winter: EEILMST 1G ME +22 352
>Pat_Gaboury: BI 12C BI +18 314
>Winter: EEILSTU K10 TIE +21 373
#note Thought of ETUI, but decided to play it safer--really hoping she won't bingo through the O, but if she does I'm hoping it won't score that much, and that my 21 points will help me out.
>Pat_Gaboury: ?ACEHIR 4B p.ACHIER +76 390
#note Not expecting this!!! I hate it, but after doing the math and seeing MYC, I can't challenge.
>Winter: DEEILSU N8 SEEL +19 392
#note Shit--SLEE(KENS) would have won!!!
>Pat_Gaboury: ACMRTUY L1 CYMAR +32 422
#note Damn, didn't see that either!
>Winter: DIU N4 DUI +19 411
#note DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN!!! THOUGHT I HAD WON, BUT AFTER RECOUNT FOUND A 10-PT ADDITION ERROR!!!
>Winter:  (TU) +4 415
