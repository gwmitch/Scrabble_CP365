#note Sigh. This is lazy. I had time to find the best play here. But instead I just glanced at the hideous unseen pool, the very limiting bingo lanes, and the huge score of JAR, and assumed that was going to be enough. When will I learn not to be such a lazy mofo? Basically, I lose if the V is in the bag and Sue plays A9 POBLAnO. Why didn't I even bother looking for it?
>Tremblay: ?ABLOOP A8 POOBAh +53 405
#note POOBAH*. I wish Sue had found the bingo, because I really deserved to lose this game for my lazy play. And obviously I need to start losing games like this before I learn from my mistakes, apparently. Oh well. Fun game, anyways.
