>New_Player_2: ELMNO 8D MELON +20 20
#note Bruce Shuman vs. Matt Bernardina, 8/28/10 Durham.
>New_Player_1: AHIRSTU 7G HUT +22 22
#note Missed TH(E)SAURI.  I've studied it, but it didn't even cross my mind in this position.  Yuck.
>New_Player_2: DDLLO E4 DOLL.D +16 36
>New_Player_1: AEIRRSZ 6H RAZE +38 60
#note IZAR or (M)IRZA to save ERS makes more sense.  Again I didn't see either in this position.  RAZE is also to easy to hook.
>New_Player_2: EGHIN L2 HINGE +32 68
#note He's set up a race to the first W.
>New_Player_1: AEEIRSS 9E .IES +19 79
#note Before Quackling I thought this play would've simmed way down, but it's pretty competitive with stuff like (H)IE and (D)IE and REA(D)IES.  I didn't like after the fact that I closed so many lanes with such a nice leave. HIE would've blocked his next play at least.
>New_Player_2: DENW 1L WEND +53 121
#note That race ended fast.  Maybe I should have inferred the setup from HINGE.  
>New_Player_1: AABEERS D4 ABA +22 101
#note ABEA(M) D4 wins the sim by a lot.  Right idea, wrong execution.
>New_Player_2: CEPRT 3J TR.CEP +20 141
>New_Player_1: EEEIRSU O1 .U.ERIES +36 137
#note Sims best.  Studying is paying off.
>New_Player_2: Q 6N Q. +31 172
>New_Player_1: EFISTTV 7M VI. +21 158
#note Quackle prefers (LI)FT over VI(E).  I was worried about knocking out the Q spot and dumping the V, but really EISTV is a pretty good leave and it opens another lane for my S.  
>New_Player_2: BIJ C2 JIB +30 202
>New_Player_1: EFFOSTT F8 ..FT +15 173
#note OFTEST is pretty.  Went for opening the S hook this turn.
>New_Player_2: EEPV F2 VEEP +31 233
>New_Player_1: ?EFGOST 6B FO..S +30 203
#note Quackle likes this. Scored as 32.
>New_Player_2: ?AIOORT 11D RO.ATIOn +78 311
#note I'm in trouble now.
>New_Player_1: ?EGRTUW 12B GREW +25 228
#note I didn't really know what to do with this UW draw.  Quackle likes GUT 10 J, and doesn't particularly like my play.  I liked that it opened up another lane at the time.
>New_Player_2: CINO H11 .ONIC +24 335
>New_Player_1: ?MNSTTU 10J MUT +22 250
#note The only bingo I saw was SMUTTING 61, and thought I'd need a higher scoring bingo with the blank to win.  MINUTEST for 72 is the top play.  Mut is 5th on the list; I wanted to keep many hook options open for a bingo, but that makes it that much easier to block. MUTT is better since it ditches another consonant too.
>New_Player_2: AADIOYY -AIYY +0 335
>New_Player_1: ?DINSTX 3F .X +17 267
#note Quackle suggests burning the blank for 7A DeX 39, leaving INST, or I10 S(I)X 25.  Again I wanted to leave things open to come back.  
>New_Player_2: EKY M9 KEY +21 356
#note The lane closes up just as I can play there.  Shouldn't be all that surprised.
>New_Player_1: ?DILNST N9 ID +25 292
#note Quackle says my win percentage is ~60% playing FLINT for 10.  I'm not smart enought to see why I guess.  
>New_Player_2: AGI 2F .AGI +17 373
>New_Player_1: ?LNNRST K6 .N +2 294
#note Yuk. This guarantees my loss. Simming the position gives me 87% winning chances for OWN and MON, but asking CP shows no winning plays available.  I don't see how I can win after OWN or MON when he has AY to outrun whatever bingo I can possibly play.
>New_Player_2: AAAOOUY 7B AY +23 396
>New_Player_1: ?LNORST 15H .ONTRoLS +80 374
#note Too little too late.  
>New_Player_1:  (AAAOU) +10 384
#note Final score recorded as 396-386.
