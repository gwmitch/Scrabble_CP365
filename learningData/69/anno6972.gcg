#note Here's one place where I DIDN'T want to draw the bingo right away.  Screws up the Y setup.  Oh well.  SAINTLY shuts it down nicely.

#note Giving her credit for the A here.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIIRR -IIR +0 213
#note Feh!  All the available plays suck, and no L.  I SHOULD go in the bag deeper and fish for the blank, but I figure with the lanes left, I'm fine keeping GI along with ER so I have (IRK)ING as a backup.  I'm probably wrong, though.  Can GIR(L)IE really be right?

#note What a gift...
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGIOQR 8K ER.GO +21 267
#note And me with no Q play!  My thought process is probably right: I can't leave the U there and hope, so I gotta hope to draw something to a good leave, and come back to dump the Q if it fails.

>Ryan_Fischer: EEGHIOR B14 HE +24 312
#note 5E GO(UT)IER 32, but it kills two lanes which I now probably need.  HE down low because it leaves the T open.  Gs are sickly, so I'm feeling kind of lost here.

#note @#(&%@! -- 0/8 on blanks at the lunch break, ladies and gentlemen!  (S)IRENIAn is the star play that'd really have my nuts in a vice.
