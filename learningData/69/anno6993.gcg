>Liz_Gottlin: BCO 8G COB +14 14
>Matt_Bernardina: GJLNNTY H7 J.LTY +15 15
#note JOLT setting up the Y is an interesting alternative.  If I had a vowel to hold back I may have considered it.
>Liz_Gottlin: AAD 10F DA.A +9 23
>Matt_Bernardina: EEFGHNN 11B HENGE +21 36
#note Best.
>Liz_Gottlin: BDU 10A BUD +18 41
>Matt_Bernardina: DFINRSS C7 FIN..RS +32 68
#note Another best.  It's like I sometimes know what I'm doing. Wish it wasn't so fleeting.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AEIRSU D2 sAURIES +72 113
#note I'd probably make the blank a K to make it harder to play around, but she may not have known it.
>Matt_Bernardina: ADIKRSX 8A AX.. +33 101
#note 3C RADIX is much better, but AXIS is at least 2nd. 
>Liz_Gottlin: EHT E5 ETH +27 140
>Matt_Bernardina: DIKRSWY 2B RI.KY +38 139
#note Another best.  Thought about D(A)WKY*, but figured that'd draw a challenge.
>Liz_Gottlin: EGT 1A GET +16 156
>Matt_Bernardina: DEGORSW 1F OWED +29 168
#note Yet another best.  Wish I could bottle this, but it's likely just easy choices dictated by the rack and board.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AEENST J2 NEpETAS +68 224
>Matt_Bernardina: GLOPRSU 13C .PRUG +10 178
#note LO(N)GSPUR, wow.  Would not have guessed there was a bingo here.  Quackle doesn't like my play, but it did have one benefit...
>Liz_Gottlin: AAILMOU -  +0 224
#note ...because she challenged it.  As we got up to the computer she remarked "I can't believe I'm challenging NJDevil from Jumbletime".   
>Matt_Bernardina: FLOOSVV -FLOVV +0 178
#note (RE)VOLV(E)S is cute and best according to Quackle. Absent seeing that, I kept an O hoping to draw into a bingo along row 14.  
>Liz_Gottlin: DOP I3 POD +20 244
>Matt_Bernardina: EILMORS 14F MOILERS +80 258
#note I think the kids call that a luckbox.
>Liz_Gottlin: CEILNOT L7 LECTION. +72 316
#note And she comes right back with another bingo.  I knew I was going to need a miracle to come back and win.
>Matt_Bernardina: AAINNQT 11K Q. +22 280
#note I wanted to slow the game down and dump the Q without much else.  Quackle likes this, although I'm still only 10% to win.
>Liz_Gottlin: EOV K1 VOE +13 329
#note Praying she doesn't block row 15, she gets stuck with those V's I threw back earlier.
>Matt_Bernardina: AAIMNNT 15B ANTIMAN +97 377
#note !!! Only two tiles in the pool bingo with AAINNT, and I draw one that fits perfectly along row 15.  It's luck, but I was still proud that I found the play and the fit.  Quite a reversal of fortune, I'm around ~70% to win now.
>Liz_Gottlin: FIIILWZ -  +0 329
#note She knew ANTIMALE, but not ANTIMAN, and she thought she needed it to come off if she was going to win, hence the challenge.  Couldn't blame her.
>Matt_Bernardina: FIIILUW 14A IF +20 397
#note K5 FIL 31 is nice.  My play is kinda blah, but I didn't know what to do with my second IIILUW rack of the day.
>Liz_Gottlin: AAEOOVZ 2J ..VAE +16 345
#note Nice play by Liz, trying to set up ZOO/ZOA to the triple.  (DE)VA 5I is harder for me to block  though.
>Matt_Bernardina: IILRUW M1 W.UR +14 411
#note To block the big Z play and leave me with an out at A5.
>Liz_Gottlin: AOOZ 4L O.ZO +28 373
>Matt_Bernardina: IIL A5 ILI. +4 415
>Matt_Bernardina:  (A) +2 417
