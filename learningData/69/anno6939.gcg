#note Wasn't 100% on CATAMITE, thinking there was a chance I was confusing it with CALAMITE. I didn't know the other bingoes (which are 9s!) and since LACTAM scored 39 I decided to play it safe.

#note Complete guess, as I was pretty sure I hadn't seen it under UROLITH on zyzzyva. Turns out I was right about not having seen it, but somehow it's still a word! Nigel held a while, but didn't challenge. Oh, and this is the ONLY bingo!
