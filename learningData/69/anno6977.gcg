>Yong_Jian_Rong: EGO 7I GEO +18 18
>Toh_Weibin: AINOSTT 9B STATION +64 84
#note (GU)STATION is interesting. I correctly avoid trying to hook TAUHOU with S.

#note Darn, I've played this before!

>Yong_Jian_Rong: EFY 10F FEY +39 129
>Toh_Weibin: EINOPSX 4L PEON +28 138
#note Probably the mistake of the game. I failed to notice M3 SI(L)EX or M2 ISO(L)EX, costing me pretty dearly.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: Q C7 Q.. +22 151
>Toh_Weibin: ?HILRSX D8 ..XIS +28 166
#note LI(MA)X is the choice here. But honestly, it's quite an uphill task catching up considering the board and my draws for the next few turns.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: AAI C11 AIA +10 161
>Toh_Weibin: ?BDHLLR 11A BR..L +14 180
#note Not much choice here - maybe something like L(OS)H N3 would be better while giving me a potential S hook later?

>Yong_Jian_Rong: AIV O1 VAI. +21 221
>Toh_Weibin: ??DGLRT -DGL +0 207
#note Not too sure what to exchange here. What's clear is that my choice isn't that great.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: ENO B13 ONE +20 241
>Toh_Weibin: ??ILRRT L8 .R +2 209
#note (U)LTeRIoR L8! But honestly, I was just hoping to pick an E or something for LIsTsER(V)...

#note RusTILY, duh.

>Yong_Jian_Rong: DEI O6 DIE +19 319
>Toh_Weibin: CCEIRRU 14I ECRU +17 311
#note Now this was just my playful attempt to even up the score. With both lines open, I had to hope I picked well, so that I could outscore him over the next few moves. Poor choice, though - I failed to consider that the bag had many good tiles...
>Yong_Jian_Rong: DDEINW 15D WINDED +48 367
>Toh_Weibin: ACIORSZ 15L SAIC +26 337
#note He's says he's mistracked, so this move (or SCAR) is the best as he won't block my Z next move.
>Yong_Jian_Rong: BEENTW 13G WEB +24 391
>Toh_Weibin: ORZ N2 ZO.. +54 391
#note Not quite enough though...
