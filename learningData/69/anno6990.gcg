#note Or just ZEK. Figured I might as well score two extra points. LORV doesn't offer much synergy.

#note Missed the AGRAPHIC hook, definitely would have played FADO if I'd seen it. This is the best way I could find to fish for another bingo -- DOS is a decent leave considering this pool (case O, case S, lots of other bingo-prone stuff to draw).

#note Even if this were a word, it still wouldn't be a good play here. RIDGY J2 is fine. This was dumb.

#note OR J1 is the best play by a mile. It leaves one in the bag, it keeps DIRSY which could either bingo (SATYRID) or otherwise score decently, and it blocks potential scoring plays in line 2 like DEFAT/AGRAPHIC. Didn't think of it. Instead I fished for STRIDOR, which plays in two spots. Two T's out there.
