#note The alphagram looked familiar, so I was a little concerned when I couldn't find the bingo right away. A little shuffling and looking for an IN- prefix jogged my memory. Still wasn't 100% sure when I put it down, but I figured it'd go regardless.

#note Held and released. When this game got close, I had to put the "should I have challenged RAGIS?" thoughts out of my head. Relieved to see it is good.

#note NONE(S) is better (as is NEONE(D) and maybe (I)N(A)NE, but I wasn't sure of NONES. Liked that this play kept seven in the bag; he bingos for 70 and I'm still up 27 with first play in a seven-on-seven endgame; just go out faster and win. As a random aside, the presence of UR# and big N10 play potential makes this a very interesting position in a Collins game, IMO.

#note Oops. Fortunately I had like 15 minutes left to play the endgame.
>Jason: DELNORU 11I LUR.D +12 430
#note Two worse than RU(D)D at 14J, which does a better job of killing things.
