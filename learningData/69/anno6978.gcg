#note I think I underestimated the defensive value of the less stylish RATOONER.  Still, I couldn't have asked for a better beginning than bingo-ing with both blanks.
>Kenji: ABW 15H WAB +41 112
>Joey: CEELNOU 7G LEU +10 158
#note I didn't think Kenji would fall for NUCLEONE*.  He laughed hysterically when I suggested it after the game.  At least I think that's why he laughed hysterically.
>Kenji: AHI B5 AHI +33 145
>Joey: ACEENOR A7 CORNEA +33 191
#note OCEAN A6 would usually be better, but this worked out fine.
>Kenji: CDEGOSU K9 GEODUCS +81 226
#note GWEDUC, GWEDUCK, GEODUCK, but not GEODUC*.  If I had at least held the play, I probably would have realized this at the time.
>Joey: AEJKPRY A1 JERKY +79 270
#note Having this available probably got in the way of wanting to challenge on the previous turn.
>Kenji: ADIL C10 LIDA. +23 249
>Joey: AAAEIPZ 6F ZAP +42 312
#note NAZI F8 is better because the leave is easier to take.

>Kenji: MM J10 MM +26 341
>Joey: AEENRTU 1A .EU +10 374
#note Maybe I should have just played HE 15N.  There was still an I left for JAUNTIER.
>Kenji: OW 15M W.O +27 368
>Joey: AEINPRT H13 P.. +8 382
#note Guess it will come down to who bingos last.
>Kenji: BGL E12 BL.G +16 384
>Joey: AEINRTV 4C .NVITE +20 402
#note Maybe I should fish again with VINA I12.  The fact that he played three tiles made bingo-ing slightly less imminent, but it wasn't slightly enough.
