#note Wonder if I'll be lucky enough my hook will still be there?  Probably only if he bingoes.  Q likes OFAY 12A best.

#note 6J WE 28?  I guess.  I just wanted to open things up a it.  8J WIENER 43 is an option, too.

#note 1J GA(W)SIE 30.  Yep.  I really shouldn't have parted with both Ses.  I was blind to the MHO hook.  Bleh.

#note I saw (R)EI but I didn't like how suicidally desperate it seemed.  Ditto fir I(C)I(ER) which would come up later.  I'm still down, need to score.  Which is why (N)EEP.

#note Got lucky on that on.  Okay, crunch time.  Bingos from the P and hooking MU are possible.  I'm down a few points, both blanks unseen.  It seems to me, either way I'm screwed.  If I play I(C)I(ER), he scores from the P and I can't catch him.  If I play from he P, he bingos, and I can't catch him.  I think I played pretty solid throughout except for SAGOS.  Oh well.

#note Yeah, eval says I(C)I(ER).  Didn't think it through enough.  The only other play Champ picks is exchanging three Is.
