>Ryan_Fischer: AGIJOWX 8F JAW +26 26
#note Decided to try the Carl Johnson "when you hold the X" opening gambit.  And yea it's cool how to see how it jumps to the top of sim, even though in practice it doesn't usually pay off.  I keep the O to play under the J, of course.

>Ryan_Fischer: CIIORSX 11E XIS +28 96
#note I hated playing XIS, but it seems to be right.
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: ?ADINRT D9 TRAINeD +79 132
#note Haha - 10B DeRAT(T)IN(G) 79.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIOORU 15A CAR.IO +27 123
#note 6H CO(UM)AROU 27; L1 CIAO 24; 15D (D)OURA 18.  This is back 'cause I leave the U.  Anyone who tries using 14F will usually get punished, and there's the (CARDIO)ID extension which might come into play.
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: EOT C11 TOE +24 156
>Ryan_Fischer: EEORUVV C4 OEUVRE +17 140
#note L3 VOE is ugly; 4K (G)UV is fishy.  So it's between two placements of OEUVRE.  The left one is safer and more conducive to the board I like.
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: ADMU 14F MAUD +23 179
#note Probably safer at D1.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEPVYZ 15H PEAVY +66 206
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: ILOR L11 ROIL. +16 195
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEIRTZ D3 ZED +33 239
#note Haha, that's bad -- I missed 4A ER(O)TIZED 92.  Convinced myself there wasn't anything there.

>Ryan_Fischer: BCEEFNO N11 FEEB +28 332
#note Thought about BEEF, didn't want to give the Y hook.
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: FOU O13 FOU +27 249
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGNOSY L3 COG +24 356
#note Pretty lazy play.  COY 13H might let me bingo.
>Bruce_"Humans_Cuber"_Shuman: EHI E5 HIE +26 275
>Ryan_Fischer: AENQSTY B2 QAT +27 383
#note My only big mistake of the tourney, I would say.  The play is probably Y(E) or Q(I).  I really don't understand what B13 YE(A) accomplishes.  I guess emptying the bag here isn't a cardinal sin as I thought, but I lose ton spread if I do.
