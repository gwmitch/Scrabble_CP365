#note The play, though way down on Q's static eval, I'm confident, is WI(S)T.  You keep the O to come back with ZOA/AFOUL if nothing better opens up.  But that's just, like, my opinion man.
>Scott_Pianowski: BETU F12 TUBE +18 134

#note M9 placement is dumb.

#note Haha, wow, I didn't think that'd be best!

#note No O for FORDLESS.  Can't believe I remember that one.
>Scott_Pianowski: EKOP 7D POKE +17 174
>Ryan_Fischer: DELORSS C2 RODLESS +80 305
#note Wow, DRO(P)LESS* isn't good, and isn't even #!.  Of note: SOLDERS/DORSELS.  Also LORD(O)SES.

#note Through an R is VI(R)IDIAN, which I didn't know.

#note He told me his 7th tile was J.  J(UN) now is better, but not by much.

#note RIBLET would've cut the spread considerably.  Nice play, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?I J1 sI +15 478
#note Champ says WEIr -> BIR(K) -> Q(I) -> X(U) -> (V)IE is optimal play, leading to a spread of 138.  I managed a spread of 141, 'cause he missed RIBLET.  *shrug*  I underscored (O)ROGENIc by 3.
