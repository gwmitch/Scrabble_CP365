>Ryan_Fischer: ADNPPUZ 8G ZAP +28 28
#note What a beautiful day to watch someone play Scrabble!  :)
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: ?CELQSU J2 CLiQUES +90 90
#note I woulda made it an O, but I'm cheeky like that.
>Ryan_Fischer: BDENPTU 4G UPB.ND +26 54
#note Best.  But it doesn't matter.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: HIW H1 WHI. +36 126
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGKNST G8 .EK +17 71
#note Yeah, K(U)E is a good idea.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: AI K3 A.I +30 156
>Ryan_Fischer: EGLNSTY 9E GL.Y +13 84
#note Maybe I should've exhausted my E and S.  This is <5 points back though even though it sacrifices 22 points.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: AIO E8 A.IO +10 166
>Ryan_Fischer: EINNOST M1 TENSION +77 161
#note Gambit paid off.  Maybe I shoulda chosen a more defensive placement but I was just trying to get back in it.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: OX N1 OX +38 204
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGNORU L7 OURANG +18 179
#note Spent several minutes here.  This is 4th.  7H GU(E)NO(N) 20 is best.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: ?EEERTW N5 TWEEzER +87 291
#note -_-
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMMTU K10 MI +16 195
#note One thing I'm not good at is knowing when it's a good timeto phony a lower-rated player.  I'm guessing now would be good.  I was thinking METIUM* 010 might pass.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: AEINNRS 12C INSANER +72 363
#note Now NOW!
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMRTTU 13F MUTE +20 215
#note ITERUM is good to know, but really won't help me much.  MUTE opens a couple more lanes.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: AF O8 FA +31 394

>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: HOO 5E OOH +17 411
>Ryan_Fischer: ABFIILT 6C ALIF +30 293
#note IF is reasonable.  I played ALIF to pray for the C.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: ACDEV 14I CAVED +18 429
#note Which of course he has and misuses (unless he has the S in hand).
>Ryan_Fischer: BILORTT B13 BOT +18 311
#note Where's the blottier libretto when I need it?
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: DEEGOSY 15F GOYS +30 459
#note I don'thave it, he might have it.  DOGEYS, YOGEES, and GEODESY were all possible there given the pool I didn't see.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADILRRT 13M ALT +12 323
#note I messed up here, low on time, I think.  ART is the play for the same reason I played ALT.
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: DEET A14 DE +19 478
>Ryan_Fischer: DIRR 7A RID +11 334
#note L2 DI(D) 20
>Sandeep_"Speaned_Baal"_Bala: ET 8A ET +14 492
#note And that is how to be a somewhat effective spectator at scrabble brand crossword game.
