#note PRELAW seemed a bit too open to me, although I guess things are already open enough after EVE that taking the risk isn't that bad. Very close, dead heat in the sim.

#note This doesn't sim quite as badly as I thought, although I am supposed to play through this. I just panicked because a Q spot opening up on this board seemed hopeless. (Side note: If I am gonna trade, why not keep the K? Good synergy with the ACEL.)

#note I suppose there's some merit to fishing with MEL E9 here, but I wanted to keep applying pressure with scoring plays. To me, it was either this or the more aggressive CAMEL 4A. I liked keeping an E and not opening any easy scoring lanes just yet.

#note For some reason I felt like holding onto the X and waiting for something big to do with it -- the 14J spot fits EXISTED, EXCITED, EXACTED, EXALTED, etc. EINSX seemed like a really strong leave to me, since it can hit a bingo or a giant X play depending on what I draw. The smarter move, though, is probably just fishing off the X. EGINNS is really likely to hit -- 60 percent of the pool is the letters ADEFHISU, all of which bingo on this board. If only I'd had the time to think this through over the board.
