#note This could be good, because I literally just finished, during lunch, going over a list of 7 and 8-letter ATE words that don't take an S. But will my rack contain an S?
>Winter: ALTVWWZ 7H WALTZ +26 90

#note Now and for the rest of the game, it's all about Dan blocking, blocking, blocking--not even playing--just blocking.

#note Not that the K was great, but now I have no choice but to give up points to open the board, and I need to do it now while I have the O. Quackle's fave of OH is going to lose. A tight board loses.
>Dan_Stock: CLMU 4B MULC. +18 311
#note Always with the blocking.
>Winter: ?CEINTV C3 C.TE +12 235
