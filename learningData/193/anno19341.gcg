#note 3 very reasonable options here in 8H ANOPIA, 8C APNOEA, and 8D PIANO. I opted for this play because it doesn't give an E back for Joe, and scores more than ANOPIA. However, the additional flexibility for myself after ANOPIA may well make it slightly better. I'd say any of these three choices are perfectly reasonable, but ANOPIA is most likely to lead to the most open board.

#note Joe started to play at I2 for 70, but then noticed this play. Unfortunately for me, it turned my bingo rack into a tough situation.
>dacrON: EEINNTV F2 VENETI.. +21 41
#note Decision-making is definitely a bit cloudy the first game of the morning. I didn't like that VEN(IN) gave me few options to bingo next turn, but does this play really accomplish enough to make it worth the sacrifice? The board will open up, I'm not so sure I need to force it here.

>dacrON: AABGLNO D2 GOBAN +25 66
#note This or BOGAN seem like a clear improvement over Quackle's choice of D4 GAB.

>Joe_Edley: ?AHISTT A6 SHITTA.s +89 263
#note I felt this was way too big a sacrifice to make at this point in the game, but I can definitely see the appeal of making this play - Joe really is taking a commanding lead, and a 3x3 is the main way I'd get back in the game. Not to mention, I actually had the 3x3. So, OK, I agree now.

#note Quackle is suggesting 12J LOUD here. I'm not going to be bingoing again, at this rate, so I need to use the J and Z to outscore Joe, and not give him a chance to bingo. LOUD would accomplish that. My thought was to set up this illusory B hook (that I could also draw), score a lot, and keep the L for (SCOW)L or L(EX). I'm stumped by this position.

>dacrON: BEFJLTU B1 JUBE +44 410
#note Pretty much can't win at this point. Quackle says 13M J(I)B gives me a few outs, but would require Joe emptying the bag, and I suspect he wouldn't fall for a situation like that - I'd need to bingo out to win.
