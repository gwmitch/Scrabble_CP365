>Joshua_Sokol: AAAIPST 8D AA +5 21
#note I felt the need to block the gaping hole that him hitting this spot may very well put me in, but this also penalizes me... Hmm, I think I still stand by this play to reduce variance, but maybe playing ATAPS there is better.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: Q 12K Q. +11 90
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIPSTW 6G TAWPIES +72 93
#note Missing WASPIE(S)T for 83, but given QI perhaps I should play what I played. I'm not sure. He's much less likely to bingo after this, but if he does bingo I'm screwed.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AEELRST 10E ALERTES. +62 152
#note yup... WASPIEST may have been the play anyways
>Joshua_Sokol: NOOORSV E10 .RVO +14 107
#note Is it too soon to play M12 SOON? Maybe it was what needed to be done. Otherwise this is the play for sure. Maybe SOON is right? It usually opens both a bingo lane and the bottom quadrant, but I have to hope Gabriel didn't draw well at all...
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: OX 5J OX +40 192
>Joshua_Sokol: ANOOPSY H10 .AYONS +39 146
#note Now that there is another line that Gabriel created, I have to play this to give me a new place to bingo while keeping within striking distance.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EFMU M2 FUME. +20 212
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BIIOPR 4L I.PI +18 164
#note Both 13J BI(D)I and G12 OBI are better plays than this. This is at least another 10 point error... I think I missed both plays.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: BCTU O1 CUB.T +27 239
#note bailing him out of a bad rack as I do
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABDLOR 15A LABROiD. +83 247
#note I did not know the other option, BOLLARDS.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AEEGM 14F ME.AGE +31 270
>Joshua_Sokol: IIINNOT B12 INI. +8 255
#note What a terrible, terrible post-bingo draw, but I should not be complaining because I haven't played particularly well this game at all. This play is also far too desperate and risky. I should play 15K NITON, which I missed, or simply go for the blank with A9 NITINO(L). Another 10-point mistake and they just keep adding up...
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: CHHNU A8 HUNCH +60 330
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNOOT C11 ONO +16 271
#note I think H1 ATONI(A) is the best play here, but this is close. Gonna need a miracle already.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EKRY 15K RYKE +17 347
#note game over
>Joshua_Sokol: AIJLNTW N9 JAWLIN. +38 309
#note There's nothing I can even draw into here that plays in both spots but I had to hope. He obviously has the blank. Maybe I can outscore sometimes with N10 WINTL(E)? I don't think so.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?EEGITZ B7 GITE +18 365
#note Great endgame play by Gabriel. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFGLRT 13H .F +18 327
#note Me, on the other hand, no. H1 TELEG(A) is the right play for me.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?EZ 4H ZEk +25 390
#note This though, is wrong. Gabriel should milk me with H5 Z(A)
