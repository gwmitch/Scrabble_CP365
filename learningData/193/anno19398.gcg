>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAAIMPX 8G MAXI +26 26
#note Considered setup plays like AMIA, but decided not to mess around. PAX actually sims ahead of MAXI by a point because it's so much harder to overlap or hook. 
>Marj_Hinderbleedy: BFO 7H FOB +28 28
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEOOPY 6I POO +26 52
#note Banking YA or something next turn, and something hooking EPOXY the turn after that!

#note Wow. Lost in a haze of my own cleverness, I completely missed YAWPED. Bad!

#note Here I miscounted DENTURES as 80 and thought the placements were about equal. They're not because it's 83...

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GJQRSTU N10 JUGS +37 377
#note Obviously playing off the case U and holding the Q is a tough move to make. But I was allured by the prospect of going up by a bingo when Jeremy was likely to hit one soon. I figured there were enough draws that helped me with the Q that I didn't need to fret about it. Quackle says this is a mistake. G4 JUG gives me a shot at the monster QUEST. I considered it, but couldn't help but worry about the double consonant draws. Even some of the one consonant draws leave me with no plays. So I dunno, JUG for 11 looked bad. But it's 1% better than this in the sim. Shrug?
