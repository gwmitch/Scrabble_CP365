>cesar: AEILNRU 14H .ENULAR +24 299
#note it seemed right to play for the blank here and kill a few problematic lanes. this by far seems and sims best. i considered VEINULAR* which i have gotten away with before.. but nah.
>mike: ?AEERTW E4 wETWARE +73 329
#note i blocked wetwares but this still sucks. now i'm going to lose again after losing like 2 equity points all game.
>cesar: ADINRST 8A TIAR. +18 317
#note i guess i should try figuring out what the best play is here. i wasn't good enough to find ANTRA which seems better than my play because of the bag. i was running low on time and i'm bad at anagramming. 5D RED though is super interesting but he'll block. RANDY won't work. maybe ANTRA is right. (-7)
