#note This is poor judgment. I figured it was a 3-4 point sacrifice to possibly draw a challenge or a phony hook. But really, the odds of Josh challenging a 17-point play or hooking to make a high-prob phony seven are slim. And it's more than 4 points off. This gives back a ton compared to 9C VIE. More tiles to play through, and leaves OUZO underlaps open. It's more like an 8-point sacrifice. Too much for the outside chance at a free turn. Poor judgment like I said.

#note Didn't spot INLAND. That's tricky. And being paranoid and blocking the S makes zero sense when I'm holding an S. There are plenty of S-less rakcs Josh would play YAGI from. If I can't find the good play INLAND, at least take the sensible play DONNA. Sheesh.

#note I can do this, keeping the F for D4, or do FONDUS keeping the H for H12. It's not really close, FONDUS is better. I just didn't consider it for some reason.

#note Blocking POTHERB and scoring enough to outrun his scariest outs in two. OGIVAL is better though.
