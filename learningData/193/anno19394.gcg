#note Q sims the very defensive DIE 9J neck and neck with this. I like it more. Whie it's probalby more volatile in the short run, it probably isn't in he long run and that's what I want against lower-rated opposition.

#note Didn't want to play this without an S, but I really had to I think. A(N)EW is several points back but I didn't see it in the game. Maybe it deserves consideration?
