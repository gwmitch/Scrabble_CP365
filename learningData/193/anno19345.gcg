#note Quackle cooks up something really creative - DIVA M12 sets up JAIL for 57! Not sure if that would work, though. Won't he likely block? Obviously he also has the Z spot to worry about, so he might play there instead, but this ploy still seems kinda easy to sniff out.

>Evans_Clinchy: AADILRV 11D .RAVID +22 374
#note DATIVAL scores a little extra and digs deeper into a bag that's full of decent, balanced stuff. It's also decent for blocking the board up. No reason not to.
>Marty_Gabriel: EEIMRST 13D .ERMITES +74 428
#note If I play DATIVAL, he has to find MISTERED# to bingo here.
>Evans_Clinchy: ALNOOOY 12B OO. +6 380
#note At this point I'm desperate for a bingo, so I play off O's and pry open a new line. I'm not seeing many possible eights, though.
>Marty_Gabriel: AAEEETU 12J A..E +9 437
#note Marty is low on time and recognizes two potential threats - bingos on the left side of the board, and X plays involving the J14 hotspot. Sensing that the X play is more likely, he quickly blocks.
>Evans_Clinchy: ALLNNOY B8 NONL.YAL +76 456
#note ...but miraculously, I've drawn this. Holy crap.
