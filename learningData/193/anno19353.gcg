#note WUSSY is a strong contender here but keeping WUD? on an open isn't as bad as it looks. I go for the extra points with NYS.

#note Not sure what to do in this position. Quackle says LOAVE is best here in the same spot. Looks like a winner - and I considered it but somehow dismissed it - started to run low on time - however she did have PERIANTH available as well - so gg.
