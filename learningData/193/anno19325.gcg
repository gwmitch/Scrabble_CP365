#note This play was fascinating, and I wasn't able to thoroughly look at all the options because I needed to worry about time. Options that I've found at this point are K5 WO, G3 BOW, E10 TOWNIE, N5 OBIA, 5J OW and E10 TWINE. Possible bingos for Nigel are vEINULE(T), bLUE(L)INE, and (S)ELENIUm, all of which I saw at the time. I decided that I wasn't going to block any of his bingos unless my play happened to be good for other reasons -- there's no guarantee he finds one of them, and I might also block the wrong one if he finds one or more. There's definitely a marginal value to blocking bingos though, so if two plays are close, that seems like a reasonable deciding factor. Different plays accomplish some different goals. TWINE and TOWNIE aggressively open scoring spots which he can't use and I can use very well next turn, while providing a bit of long-term defensive value by blocking the WIG hook for later. TWINE also opens an easy LUNE play, which might deter Nigel from looking longer for bingos. OBIA opens scoring spots in a similar way -- I think OBIA is not as good as TWINE and TOWNIE because ENTW is not great, it scores less, and the opened scoring spot is worse. (O)W is a great fish in this situation, as AEIR get me huge column E bingos and D gets me INTOmBED if he does SELENIUm. It's a bit risky, as if Nigel finds vEINULET my leave is not great anymore, but LEU/bLUELINE/SELENIUm all work out very well after OW. WO scores well and keeps a decent leave, but I'm not a big fan of the play here -- TWINE and TOWNIE just seem to accomplish a lot more. BOW keeps a great leave for this board and blocks vEINULET. TOWNIE seems stronger than TWINE, as Quackle thinks it averages a few more points next turn. I'm very inclined to trust Quackle here, and it makes intuitive sense because drawing high scoring tiles often allows me some lucrative row 15 plays. The only reason I might play TWINE is to induce LUNE, but I feel like that's not good enough. I'm really not sure how to decide between OW, BOW, and TOWNIE. Thoughts?

#note I didn't notice KAVA. This makes more sense though because it blocks the ET lanes and makes the VIMS hook easier to close in the future, as well as keeping a more flexiblie leave.

#note This is a huge error. I way overestimated his chances of bingoing to the L -- he only gets an extra 1-2% bingo chance after CART 7E per Quackle, so I should just play that, which does much better defending against winning outcomes that don't involve bingoing with the L.

#note I definitely want to set up my case S somehow here, but also thought about playing IF H13. I felt the setup was not strong enough to justify the 15 point sacrifice and allowing strong row 2 plays by Nigel.
