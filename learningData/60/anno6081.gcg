#note Looked for SW- words at O11; did not think to look for LW- words. LWEIS is best. Speedy says holding back the second S on this play is second. In hindsight, I agree.

#note Jason, EDAM* is not good. No matter how many times you think it should be, want it to be, wish it were ... not good. This is why you reviewed your fours beforehand, to avoid stuff like this. Can you please not screw up like this any more? You are playing BAT Premier, after all. (Two playable bingos ... both to the S. One is the only seven in this rack I didn't see, the only one that plays to the S, and DIPLOSES, which I don't know but probably should.)

#note !!! (I mean, EDAM* was all part of my master plan to not only win, but give myself biggest comeback prize.)

#note I was pleased with my post-bingo draw, especially since I saw the unseen pool was now 13-13. "Just hoard the consonants," I told myself. Two turns later I'm drawing into EIIN and practically crossing myself before reaching in the bag. *sigh*
>Winter: ADEORRS 1G EARDRO. +33 395
#note Speedy's pick if Winter is keeping the S, which I'm guessing he is.
>Jason: EEIILNO 2C OLEINE +12 429
#note CP likes (R)EOIL, putting it at 70% to win, with my play not on here. I knew this was risky (SKATE at H11 is possible and sinks my battleship), but REOIL (and IONI(C)-type plays, which I nearly did) seemed too weak. And given what Winter's rack is, what's to stop him from playing (A)T off of EARDROP next turn and having unblockable out bingos? I figured if I could draw the K, S or V out of the bag and score decently with it, it would be close but my 34-point lead after this play would be enough. Fortunately it was.

#note Stopped the three-game losing streak. Now, to pull my head out of my nether regions and start actually playing.
