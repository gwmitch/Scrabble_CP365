#note Unfortunate for Sam that he doesn't really have a good way to block the new bingo line.
>Jason: ?EHINSU 6J H... +15 299
#note CP slightly prefers UH at C5, which probably improves my bingo chances and makes it harder to block. But I like this play. I hit the C5 spot with 11/14 unseen tiles if it stays open. And a J draw threatens DJINS at N2 for 40 ... I still had a slight chance of winning without bingoing.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DJMOORV 13J JO +22 343
#note After the game, Sam was disappointed for not playing it at 7D, but this play's defensible. A play like EIDOS at 8A after the other JO placement next turn scores 39 and makes it an even game with me with the blank. A good thing my fish last turn scored 15, so I could threaten a win without bingoing. CP seems to like this play over the 13J JO. Another option is a play like FORM or FORD at 4L, setting up JO for 38 next turn. I don't know what I'd do in this spot. Thoughts?
>Jason: ?DEINSU C5 UnDINES +64 363
#note SUbINDE(X) would've made life easier; instead of picking a play that wins about 98%, I pick one that wins 53%. Fortunately the bag was kind.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DMORSTV B10 MORTS +38 381
#note D(E)V at 10B ties, but I think Sam was short of time at this point. Not easy to see.
>Jason: BILO 8A BO.L +21 384
#note O(I)L is eight better, as the set-up is unblockable.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DV J12 D... +12 393
>Jason: I 3H .I +5 389
#note Scratchy start to the tournament, but my concerns of starting 0-3 (or worse) could now disappear.
