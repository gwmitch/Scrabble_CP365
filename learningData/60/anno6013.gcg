#note Setting up my Q with 7 I's unseen. So far so good in Game That Goes Horribly Wrong #1.

#note SCUTTED*. I held it for 2 or 3 minutes. I knew CUTTINGS was good, and I knew it had an anagram, and there's lots of anagram pairs that look like CUTTINGS/SCUTTING*.  After looking it up postgame, being omniscient and all-powerful as we all are AFTER games have concluded, I immediately realized that the anagram was TUNGSTIC.  Apologies to the Premier players near the challenge machine when I discovered this. Weera told me he drew several I's, two or three, after this bingo. If I challenge it off and play HOWL or WOOL, I have a much better shot at getting one of those, possibly hitting QI for 40+, and taking command of the game.
