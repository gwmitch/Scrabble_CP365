#note 12C PARDIE/PERDIE look very good, but I missed that spot. I almost played K4 AEDILE. PAIL doesn't expose as many tiles, but creates a formerly nonexistent S-hook with all of them unseen, and I was even cognizant of that while deciding. Aargh.

#note FAT is definitely better. KURTA creates a good sevens line.

#note Haha, wow. Total fail. What is my problem? I had MINNOWS spelled out on my rack, but whiffed the semi-obvious spot. Coincidentally, TOPMINNOW was an alphagram missed by a group of players, led by Ian Weinstein, doing Jumbletime 9s on the hotel lobby computer after hours.
