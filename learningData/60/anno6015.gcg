#note 11D DEPORT looks pretty good - same score, avoids opening 8s lines. A mistake, but not a huge one.

#note WRUNG to burn more tiles and reach into a loaded bag definitely makes sense. I was hoping to continue scoring and applying pressure, but this play could very well have been my fatal error, innocuous as it seems. Every extra tile I pick in this situation has a huge chance of bringing me something good. With the board being what it was, I wasn't expecting this to be Game That Goes Horribly Wrong #2.

#note Sheesh, where the heck are these power tiles?! I thought about TOEA, and if there were fewer I's to draw I would have definitely done it, but it still might be better to keep a consonant. I wanted the points over INIA, but I'm not sure how much the more flexible leave is worth.

#note Noooo. Short of E- bingos to the triple, this is the worst possible thing that could have happened.

#note The blank appears, but tragically, it's too late. This seems like my best shot.
