#note How in heck did I miss IVO(R)Y and, even worse, VINE(R)Y leaving OR instead of EO?
>Rod_MacNeil: ?GHNUYZ -IIII +0 97
#note (Rod kept ?NZ.)
>Jason: ?AEELNO 13H ENOLAsE +69 160
#note For a second I thought I had ELEVATION at D5 if this got blocked before seeing it was ELEVA(T)O(I)N*. Curses.

#note I had to laugh. Against Lerman, I bingoed for 62, answered for 61. I bingoed for 68, answered for 87. Here I bingo for 69, answered for 69. I bingo for 75, answered for 110. The lesson, of course, is not to bingo.

#note The EO leave pays off again! And if he plays for more than 80 here, I'm quitting Scrabble.

#note Ooh, BOHUN(K) (didn't know it). Definitely way better.

#note Frank mentioned the UN(BOSOM)ING story (again) at dinner, when randomly, I remembered this play and how I wanted to play BOSOM at 2B for 42 before seeing this/it got blocked, keeping UN. I wondered if there was a spot of UNBOSOM ... and when I saw the board while Quackling when I got back, I headdesk-ed even before asking for choices. If I'd been playing Jesse Matthews, he might've challenged UNBOSOM again on principle.

#note Still no idea what I should do here. CP seems to like NUN in this spot, which never crossed my mind. Somebody teach me pre-endgames...
>Rod_MacNeil: AEGHNPS 9I SANGH +21 447
#note This was interesting. It took me a while (about 10 minutes, I'd guess) to see the win if I let it go (it's good) ... and then I wasn't sure if my winning play was good. (I also had to recount the game to make sure my play did indeed win by one.) I would've felt really stupid letting a phony go to make a non-winning play. CP says HWAN is best, which wins 3/8 (AER) and ties a fourth (U). But this is better, winning if the tile in the bag is any of AERS, giving Rod a 50-50 shot.
>Jason: DENNRSU D3 .D.URE +30 469
#note Best (although in the "too good to be true" category, I wondered if I was confusing this with ABJURE), but I was very surprised to learn while Quackling that Rod still has two winning sequences and a tie. Can you find them?
>Rod_MacNeil: AEP 2M APE +15 462
#note In the post-mortem, we both assumed this had to be better than PE(S) at 14L, since APE netted 21 and PES scored 21 with me playing S(U)N at N3 if I get a chance. But the A scores 16 at 11E. Would've lost 486-484. Wow. The PA at 14A/(W)E(N) sequence also wins by one and the (ZA)P/E(T)A at 11E sequence ties. Wow.
