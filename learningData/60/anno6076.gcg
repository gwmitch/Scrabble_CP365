#note Turning point.  I don't like (OD)ORIZE (not that I saw it).  Or EROTIZE.  Or ZEKS.  Or HAZIER.  I wanted to lose both the Z and K, and ZERK wasn't appealing.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't know.

>Michael_Wolfberg: ?ELNORV -V +0 155
#note He took like 15 minutes here and couldn't find OVERLENT.  So he threw in the V.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIRTTY C10 YETT +23 212
#note I started to push him on time, threw this down quickly.  Saw TYE first, like this better.
>Michael_Wolfberg: ?ELNORS 3C fON.LERS +70 225
#note He blocked REIN(D)EER and now my lead is nothing.  And this sounds like a non-word to me, a word that might should be, but isn't.  There's something like it.  I forget what it is.  Anyway, this whole situation sucks.  I'm pretty much on tilt here.
