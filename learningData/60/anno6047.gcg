>Jason: DJLNPTY K6 PLY +21 39
>Scott_Appel: EEGL L3 GLEE +14 33
>Jason: ?DEJNTU 3I JUD.E +44 83
#note Speedy's pick, although JUDgE(ME)NT has style points abound.
>Scott_Appel: AEKNOSW E3 WEAKONS +87 120
>Jason: ?AAENTZ D1 AZAN +37 120
#note ZETA at F2 is less risky.
>Scott_Appel: FIR 2A FRI. +32 152
>Jason: ?CEIMPT C1 M.C +34 154
#note Wasn't 100% on METoPIC, the only playable one. Figured this had to be close equity-wise to METoPIC anyway. (Speedy says it's 5-6 behind)
>Scott_Appel: AEOR A1 A.ORE +27 179
>Jason: ?EIIPST M6 PInITES +67 221
#note Frustrating that I couldn't hook to JUDGE. But the next draw makes up for that slight disappointment.
>Scott_Appel: ALUW L11 WAUL +23 202
>Jason: ACDIOST 15F DACOITS +92 313
>Scott_Appel: GIOR N1 GIRO +25 227

>Scott_Appel: HNOSY O4 HYSON +54 281
>Jason: ?ENOOTU D8 OUTdONE +69 418
#note I did not expect AINOOUV to bingo this quickly (if ever).
>Scott_Appel: IX 2J XI +53 334
>Jason: AABEEII K10 BAA +25 443
#note Somehow whiffed on all the row 14 plays: BAILIE, BAILEE, BELIE and AALII. I blame it being 11 o'clock (I'd been up since 5 a.m.), thinking the game was basically over and wanting to be done to listen to the Red Wings/Phoenix game.
>Scott_Appel: DGL 14B GL.D +12 346
>Jason: EEEFIIN F9 EF +16 459
#note FIE, N9. Hoped for the RT draw I would get.
>Scott_Appel: DENQRTT B5 TRENT +9 355
#note Not challenging is a 42-spread-point mistake. Of course, I didn't even hold, figuring: Why would he phony when RENT/TERN/TREND blocked just as well? 
>Jason: EEIINRT 14J TI.E +12 471
#note At least I had the right idea in the endgame ... about the only thing I did right after OUTdONE.
>Scott_Appel: DOQ 9L Q. +11 366
>Jason: EINR A7 REIN +22 493
#note (MA)RINE is two more. Glad this luckboxing wasn't the difference between Scott winning and losing the tourney.
>Jason:  (DO) +6 499
