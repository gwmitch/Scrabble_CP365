#note 4D c(O)NT(E)NDED 90.  This is bogus.  He saw INDENTED, didn't like it.  My mistake.

#note Wow, BARNACLE does take a D.  D(O)W.  This is probably bad news, closing off a couple lanes for him.

>Seth_Lipkin: AEZ 10D .AZE +33 372
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGMRST 11D .MARET +37 359
#note No STERIGMA MIGRATES during RAGTIMES, MAGISTER.  Oy.  (I)MARET is probably my 2nd best play of the tourney.  I was so close to trying REGMAS*.  Glad I didn't.  RAMETS is an option I didn't know, either.
>Seth_Lipkin: EHNNP 12F PEH +38 410
#note Well, maybe my play wasn't so hot.  He told me he had two Ns, didn't want to make a new hook, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGOOPS 2C GO +6 365
#note GO(T) is dumb.  No bingo spots left.  My play gives me the best chance of pulling something outta my ass.
>Seth_Lipkin: S 11D ......S +9 419
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEFOPS 6J FOE +27 392
#note Missed.  Tracked a little off.  Still hope of salvaging something...  It looks lke sPO(T)S I8 might work.
>Seth_Lipkin: DINNSTW 12J INNS +10 429
#note L6 (E)NWINDS
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EPS 10I aPES +23 415
#note I knew I was missing something!  EPoS wins by 1!  Just wasn't quite brave enough to pull it out.
