>Jeffrey: CEFLORW 8D FOWLER +32 32
#note I really don't look at ratings before I play but for anyone interested: Jerry's 1869 to my 1512 pregame.  Full game analysis likes REFLOW 8G best?  ballsy, setting up (REFLOW)ING?  No like-y.
>Jerry: HPRSUUY G6 SU.PHURY +74 74
#note This got a hold, mostly out of respect.  It's a pretty elemental bingo (*ta-dun-ching*).  I was pretty wowed considering how low-probability it is.  I guessed 26K/29K 8s and turns out it's even rarer- 28.9 K down the list
>Jeffrey: CILMOOV 11E OV.M +18 50
#note I toyed with this rack a bit, not sure of the best. Speedy Q agrees with my decision but FullGame likes OVOL(O)?  ICM leave on this board?  Hunh.  Jerry later said it blocked two bingos.
>Jerry: AEV H13 AVE +23 97
>Jeffrey: ACEILOZ 14H .OCALIZE +106 156
#note since I had just put down a V I was so upset to see it unavailable- thought there was no chance I'd get another.  I also looked for an L right away(Jerry said F works too).  Not an extremly hard find but I was psyched nonetheless
>Jerry: DEJ O12 JE.D +60 157
>Jeffrey: GIINOOS 7C OI +8 164
#note only big miss of the game- I didn't think to look for 8s in the J column, ISOGONI(C) -50.7
>Jerry: DP I13 P.D +23 180
>Jeffrey: GINORST J2 TRIGONS +75 239
#note My grooming was rewarded!  Best and only
>Jerry: BITTY 12A BITTY +31 211
>Jeffrey: AELNRRS 4E SNARL.ER +68 307
#note another great draw on the Bango tip
>Jerry: IQ 11B QI +24 235
>Jeffrey: AEEHORT N13 A.O +17 324
#note this was far down the list of top plays, but I thought it would be clever to set up the H(AE)/H(I) action.  The duck likes 3G HOE(R)  -9
>Jerry: ACX L12 CA.X +42 277
#note Okay so I guess I won't be going there
>Jeffrey: ?EEHKRT K13 K.E +22 346
#note I saw A12 (B)ERK but give away the last R?  -1.6
>Jerry: ?BDGINO L1 BOa.DING +66 343
>Jeffrey: ?AEHIRT 3A THERIAn +73 419
#note I saw THERIAN / INEARTH / HAIRNET like anyone else RETINA-savvy but one of those goes at 15A (-16 or FG says -23)  I had noted the -ED possibilities earlier but didn't remember so much, especially since he blocked the sexy HA(T)TERIa.  
>Jerry: EFLNOT M1 EFT +23 366
#note partial rack info- Jerry told me he could have played (T)EFLON but his win % was better here (especially since I had just bingoed*, so not much chance of pain)
>Jeffrey: AEEIMNS A1 MA.INEES +149 568
#note ah yes, awesome draw!
>Jerry: N 6A .N +4 370
>Jeffrey: AGINTUW 2F WAG +31 599
#note not much to decide, saw my 2-and-out and went with it
>Jerry: ADEELOU A12 .AUD +21 391
>Jeffrey: INTU 15D UNTI.. +8 607
#note best and only (well, twin UNITED too)  Whew, what a game!  1000s are fun, and 5 power tiles each to boot.
>Jeffrey:  (EELO) +8 615
