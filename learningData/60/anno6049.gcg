#note Quackle's suggestion of 13L plays (NUB is CP's preference) seem to me like they're too needlessly risky without a guarantee of hitting next turn.

#note In hindsight, I should've played FEZ. Even so, CP says I'm 73% to win, about to go up 51, almost guaranteed to get 45 from the Z next turn, and he's exchanged six (which comes with no guarantees). Loving life.

#note And the beginning of the end of my short stay in contention. This game certainly humbles you, and one reason I never get ahead of myself if that it seems like every time I do, something like this happens. Just before this went down, I actually thought "I have a good chance to get to 4-1!" Nope. Stay in the moment, kid.
>Jason: EINRSTZ -  +0 311
#note Grob rule (if it scores 100 and you aren't 100% sure, challenge) definitely in full effect. Of course, my count somehow got way off and I had five tiles in the bag instead of 11. ZENIT(H) actually wins 9% of the time. I figured this was good (how can you make it up?), but obviously not 90% sure. Had to challenge (and potentially cost myself high loss). :)

#note Then we got a few laughs out of the fact that Ian forgot to record his pass six and therefore gave himself my 37 for HELM and gave me 203 for the triple-triple. Good stuff.
