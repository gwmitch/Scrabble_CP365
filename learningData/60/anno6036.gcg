>Rob_Robinsky: AIKNNTV 9C KIVA +21 39
#note Didn't see TANUKI 10F, but may have passed on it anyway...Chris' play definitely suggests he may have an S.

>Rob_Robinsky: LMNNQTX -LMNNQT +0 39
#note I'm not really a fan of going all-in on a power tile bomb, but there's literally nothing here.  Quackle agrees.

#note Chris was not pleased.
>Chris_Cree: ENTU L12 TUNE +18 69
>Rob_Robinsky: ADENOQT 10B QAT +40 133
#note If Chris finally hit something it'll hurt, but there's no way to pass up these points for the Q and a decent leave.
>Chris_Cree: EHIRSTT J2 HITTERS +80 149
#note TR(IT)HEIST is pretty damned cool.

>Rob_Robinsky: ?CEERRT 12A C.TERERs +74 395

>Rob_Robinsky: EINR 5J .RINE +23 418
#note I don't have this rack written down, but I'm pretty sure this isn't right.  Was a little bit low on time at this point, but not too badly.
