#note Missed CHIGGE(R). That would've helped.

>Jason: ACEFGIK M7 K.F +39 208
#note Using the KF, I accidentally played a phony two first. ;)
>Brian_Bowman: EV 14H .EV +14 257
#note Yeah, it's about to get real ugly real fast.
>Jason: ACEFGII 7F AI. +18 226
#note I basically just moved tiles the second half of this game. Not my finest hour. At least I correctly fought off the temptation to play FI(N)A* at J2.
>Brian_Bowman: IQ 3I QI +44 301
#note So much for that whole "maybe I can win by just continuing to score decently" idea.
>Jason: CDEEFGI 2J GIE +16 242
#note Ugh. This is what happens when you try to out-block "The Blocker." I might as well keep trying to score and hope to hit JX instead of opening an easily-blockable bingo line.

>Brian_Bowman: EIJORTY 3M J.T +20 366
>Jason: CDEEILN 15A CLINED +41 322
#note Not often you can get away with three phonies on Brian in two turns. Did a decent job of saving spread.
>Brian_Bowman: ?ELORTY I12 .Y. +19 385
#note An endgame mishap caused by the fact that Brian thought REV had six spots after it, not five.
