#note I guess FAY/FAYED are pretty strong. i was just trying to choose between GUY and FUG. ADESY didn't seem too bad to me, and I could keep the Y hook if it didn't work out. anyway, GUY sims better than FUG, and FAY sims best, so oops. -4

#note 7B VAR? how best to maximize spread here? i thought by blocking the triple lane, but i don't really like blocking. VAR i guess. -5 overcounted this by 1. remind me to double check my math, i shouldn't have won this tournament. (probably)
