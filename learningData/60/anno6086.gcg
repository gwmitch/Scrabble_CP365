>Chris_Cree: ALNOT 8E TONAL +10 10
#note Anybody at Bruce Adams' trivia game Saturday night will appreciate the fact that Chris could've said after this play: "I got 10 frickin' points!" (Although he originally scored it as five, lol.)
>Jason: EEFIMNN 9F FEN +17 17
#note Friday night, riding from dinner at Chili's with Frank, Bowman and Keller when Frank starts playing his CD of Chris Cree songs. For Bowman (the country fan), I asked Chris about it before the tournament ... and he sent me one, too. Wonder what I could get for it on eBay? :)

#note Oh, duh. ECOToNE is one more.
>Chris_Cree: AEEHMR 14J HAREEM +55 219
#note Now I'd wished I'd made the (inferior) play of CONE or COTE, bottom left, keeping ?EN/?ET.

#note Maybe YOU at 13M instead?
>Chris_Cree: ADFO 15A FADO +42 261

>Chris_Cree: AGRSU L8 SUGAR +17 278
#note Just a really demoralizing play.
>Jason: EIILOPU L1 PILEI +26 256
#note Scoring decently with these five-vowel racks, but it's a house of cards. And it's about to topple.
>Chris_Cree: ?EISTUW 3G oUTWI.ES +72 350
#note My opening turns an orphaned WETSUIt into the dagger.
>Jason: ADNORUU 1L .OUR +18 274
#note ROUNDU(P)! That would've been nice.

#note Don't be stubborn, Jason. Just play the bingo and lose; playing for the out bingo is stupid and pointless and doesn't win unless Chris *really* screws up. (Although, in my defense, CP put PANDIES as 0% to win while PAD in this spot checked in at 5.76%.)
>Chris_Cree: BRT H1 BR.T +21 427
#note I was a little down after this game (having gone from 3-1 to 4-6), and I think Chris sensed that. We didn't post-mortem at all, but he told me how cool it was to see so many new faces in Premier and that he was glad I'd qualified, a sentiment he re-iterated as we said goodbye Sunday. That meant a lot.
>Jason: ADEEINS 12H DINA. +19 320
#note I didn't know DENARI with one I. That word-knowledge fail costs me eight spread points. At least I had the right idea.
>Chris_Cree: AILNTV N3 .ILVAN +17 444
>Jason: EES O7 SEE +17 337
#note Now 1-5 in the past six games; ugh.
