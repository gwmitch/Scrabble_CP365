#note One of the highlights of BAT was playing Anagrams, and then just chatting, with Frank, Sam K., Rob and Derek for about six hours. Good times.

#note I held, but released in part because I saw Rob had eMPTINS and I figured he was just trying to draw the challenge. (It's good; he later said he only saw eMPTINS while on hold.)

#note CP puts this second to F(O)IN at E8, which would've prevented the impending disaster.
>Rob_Robinsky: EX 10D .EX +56 332
#note I suppose I should've blocked the N6 X-bomb spot to ensure I'd draw the X next turn like Rob did. Live and learn...

#note In hindsight, I could've gotten tricky by putting this down, trying to gauge Rob's reaction, and then playing BA at N6 or A7 when I figured by his lack of frustration that he had hit his fish and tried to go for the out bingo. But, that wouldn't have worked anyway, since he had (R)EWIrING at the bottom.

#note At least I left him only one winning play... So much for getting over .500 again.
