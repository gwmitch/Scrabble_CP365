#note playing BOOT is actually almost even, since it's a couple of points better defensively.
>Mack: ELUZ L10 .UZEL +28 51
#note mack took a long time to make this play, suggesting that he didn't have the S.

>JD: CEGLNOR K7 COL.N +23 97
#note how do I read PIE? it seems like a faily strong fish, although he would also play it with some weaker racks as well. my logic here was that by playing COLON, I leave a lane that I can bingo on without an S (BOOR) and if he has an S bingo, it'll probably go on row 10 now since I am blocking ABS. on the oter hand, after CLOG and a bingo on row 11, there are no bingo lanes. at the end of the day I think it's too close to call but I'm fine with my logic. the sim is neck and neck.

#note go away Os! my 6th played of the game
>Mack: DEIOSST H5 SOD..ITES +61 160
#note nice
>JD: EEEEILM 5C MELEE. +16 128
#note go away Es! I sacrificed 2 points here because I thought the board would stay open better if I played at the top-left (more lanes to play through at the bottom). I'm already at a deficit and will need to bingo a couple of times to pull ahead. the increased openness of the board is somewhat borne out in a quackle sim.
>Mack: ACIPRRS D4 P.RISARC +76 236
#note in this case unfortunately I gave mac a spot for his bingo
>JD: AEEIJOS 12A JOES +64 192
>Mack: INX A12 .INX +54 290
>JD: ?AEINNU C2 NEU. +16 208
#note I thought I needed to open a new lane with NEUM, but quackle suggests the intriguing fish of UP/UM at C4 - the idea being the 6/34 shot of drawing XANTHEIN, as well as plenty of backup bingos. it also slows the game down a bit more. however, even if I hit XANTHEIN I will still be down a bingo, and he may have the time in the case to close the E on the right and leave me with no more bingo lanes.
>Mack: DEFY B1 DEFY +39 329
>JD: ?ADHINU O1 DAUpHIN. +83 291
#note the best case scenario, bingoing in a way that opens another lane
>Mack: AABNW L1 BWANA +29 358
>JD: ?EFTTTV 2A V..T +7 298
#note I have some lanes to work with, including the non-obvious FILIAL lane, the O on column B and the A on row 3. However, a play on row 10 or 11 could block FILIAL and the O and leave me with only the weak lane to play to. if I play VOTE or VETS for points then he will likely just block FILIAL. TAV at K3-K5 takes away some cheap scoring plays he could have and keeps the same letters as my play, but again allows him to block. my play sacrifices some points but I saw no other way of opening a distracting threat.
>Mack: MUY K3 YUM +35 393
>JD: ?EFINTT B7 FIsTN.TE +80 378
#note FISTNOTE seemed like too many points to pass up at the time (maybe he has a nightmare consonant draw) but what I should probably do is play RIF at 6D. he can probably outrun me if he has a vowel, but if he has 7 consonants and I do draw a bingo on row 1, then I should win. the odds of this are low but not impossible.
>Mack: AADGRRW 1D AWARD +33 426
#note with the actual pool he can always score too many points, I'm sure. His best sequence here is RIGS at 8A saving AWARD for next turn to block my best play.
