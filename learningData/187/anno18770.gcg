#note this was going to be a fun game.
>JD: FIIIIOS 13F OI +16 77
#note really, really awful decision! with the board so wide open the last thing you want to do is keep a bad leave! just exchange
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?EEGNTW 2H .WEETiNG +76 138
>JD: EFIIIRS 8H .....IER +39 116
#note an EIRS leave here is an almost certain bingo! stupid OI

>JD: AFIIOOS O1 A.IO +18 134
#note I did conider MAFIOSO, but it seemed to amount to giving away my ammunition too early. I underestimated the badness of the FIOS leave - really should just blow it up and draw something more useful. I bingo more after MAFIOSO than I do after AGIO.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EIKT 15A KITE +37 208
>JD: FGIOSSY 10D YOG.S +24 158
#note I wanted to make a play that kept all the lanes on the right open, and this not only does that but even creates some new threats.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EOPX 15F EXPO +43 251
>JD: DEFFHIS 11C FEH +33 191
#note this play is terrible! it shuts down my own new quadrant. FIFED would be a much better way to persevere
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: OUV K5 OVU. +18 269
>JD: ADFIRSU 3K DIF +27 218
#note again, a subpar play...FAYED at D8 would create some useful real estate for bingoing and score extra.

>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: CDEINRZ O12 DICE +32 364
#note we debated this position quite a bit - it's really difficult for him because I have such big scoring plays threatened at O12. I suggested ZINE at 5B, but quackle doesn't like it that much - my per turn average after that is 63. another quackle choice is DITZ or NERTZ, which might have some chances of bingoing at the top-left if I take O12.
>JD: EHLORSY I2 .Y. +22 378
#note I saw HOLEY at 5B, but with only two vowels unseen it seemed best to hoard them. he will have to spend at least one vowel to play the Z for any points, and in that case I can probably outrun him.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: Z 7G Z. +21 385
>JD: AEHLORS J10 HAOLES +33 411
#note there are some higher spread way of proceeding, but I could see that this was sufficient to always win, so I went for it.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ALMNNNR 3B NAM +22 407
#note I was not expecting the blank to be in the bag!
>JD: ?R 14J .Rs +19 430
#note a lot of misplays in the beginning, but good enough to cash thanks to some lucky draws at the end, and finding WYE was good.
