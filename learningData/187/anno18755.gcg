#note Verties = Verites!
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGORSW G8 WOG +21 21
#note I considered WOG G8, GROW G7 and WEDG(Y) 12D. I think WOG is better than GROW since DERS is just that much better than DES, but the problem with WOG is that it doesn't provide an S hook, whereas GROW does. That makes GROW a bit better but the leave difference is still an overcoming factor. WEDG(Y) scores but the leave isn't comparable and I'm sort of in a rut after his first play. Hmm... I still need to think about this position.
>Matt_Canik: GHIORTT I4 QUINTED +86 128
>Matt_Canik: GHIORTT --  -86 42
#note I held this. Then I laughed, then I asked myself if I was crazy, then I asked myself if Matt was crazy, and then I regained myself and challenged. Matt said "damn, that wasn't supposed to happen"
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEIMRS 8G ..D +7 28
#note This is a good play if he misses EQUIT(Y). I missed it too. We all miss EQUITY. I have no idea what to do here actually. I took forever to play this. Probably should just go for points rather than bingo %.
>Matt_Canik: DEIT I10 TIED +25 67
#note Yeah probably missed EQUIT(Y).
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEIMRS H8 .....ED +23 51
#note this was my first successful "draw the challenge" play of the tournament I think. Thanks Kenji!

>Matt_Canik: AENOQUV F6 OVA +16 83
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIIMRS E4 HIM +20 81
#note This seemed like it interfered best with his QUN, but I really don't know if I should have played HI(D) at 14F, EH J9 for points or HEIR/HIRE at E8 for leave+points. A ton of plays seem good here, and this is just one of them. I felt like I should be trying to counterplay his QUN as best as I could.
>Matt_Canik: NOQTU 4A QUOT. +54 137
#note This was unfortunate, but it was to be expected. It's not at all unlucky for me, this was a risk I didn't measure.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIRSTY F2 YEA +32 113
#note I don't know why I decided to go for points this turn when I could have kept EIRST for 9 less. I think this was an error, and that F3 YA is the right play.
>Matt_Canik: ENRU A4 .UERN +42 179
>Joshua_Sokol: FINRSST 6A .FS +14 127
#note This was starting to get frustrating. Matt had lost 2 turns and yet I was still in a really bad position. I think that this was another error induced by frustration. 3E S(E)RF is the play I should make if I'm seeking to bingo next turn, but 9A SIFT is clearly the right play, as it scores while keeping a very good leave.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?INNRST K6 TINNeRS +73 236
#note I had now played 2 phonies and Matt had lost 3 turns, but yet I was still in a bad position give my knowledge of his rack. Am I supposed to block JAPE?
>Matt_Canik: AEJP E8 JAPE +42 263
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIOORV 1A OH +26 262
#note It's between this and D9 HOOVER. I'd take HOOVER in a do-over for turnover to get SS? ASAP and because it scores, but also cause Matt might have challenged. Who knows after how many turns he's lost already so far. 
>Matt_Canik: ?DEISTU 14A STUrDIE. +72 335
#note bleh
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOORVW A12 WI.E +33 295
#note Now that things are grimmer than ever I think it's important to score and open when I have a good leave to rely on. L4 WOO fails way too often. Maybe VI(S)E over this though, since the V isn't very good for me if I'm not bingoing, which I'm not. 
>Matt_Canik: AABIL J3 LABIA +15 350
#note This was perfect timing for a pun that I delivered well: "took you a while to find that, huh?"

>Joshua_Sokol: AACNORU L3 .AU +12 329
>Matt_Canik: AELLNST O8 LENT +18 462
#note Hard to know what to play here. LENT looks fine but if you're going to play LENT why not just play (E)L and fish?
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGINOR M8 CARING +25 354
#note I'm just mad cause he blocked my bingo. Neither of us thought of A(TREMBLE) in this pre-endgame/endgame, which changes a lot. This is obviously not even close to a good endgame play. 
>Matt_Canik: AILS B8 AILS +8 470
#note -19 to SIAL/ATREMBLE but we both missed it as I said.
