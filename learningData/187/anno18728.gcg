#note fishing with PIX is not that far off. If I miss my bingo after PIX I can probably play EARPHONE for 39 as a backup play. Still, taking the points pulls ahead

#note I signal that I have the S, but it seemed worth it to clean up my rack (my bingo percentage goes up 8% by doing so)

#note I agonized over this play for many minutes. not sure that I saw BEAM at 9C (not sure I like it anyway) but I saw BELLMEN and passed it up, which must be a mistake. after BELL it is too easy for mack to score on row 6 and block the bingo lanes and leave me permanently down a tempo, since BELL does not create much of a new threat.

#note a colossal miss of (PA)VEMENTS!!! my win percentage drops from 65% to 35% in one play. no excuse. depending on how I read UH, it might be wise for me to play VENOMS at F5 here and not give him nice 8 lanes to play through (UH might be a fish of his own). in any case my tempo here was awful - blowing up my rack and giving him bingo lanes. BELLMEN would've prevented this situation, even though in this case I was given the silver bullet of PAVEMENTS that I missed.

#note time was already an issue after how long I spent on BELL.  it was nice to have a relatively straightforward play.

#note mack smartly starting to control the board. I really need to reopen the top of the board to have a chance
>JD: AALMNST 4K MALT +26 214
#note MALT seemed to make it harder for him to overlap and block by new lane (EMU/SAY). a couple of other options look competitive - MANLY at L1 opens more dramatically but gives him a lot more free points, and LAM at N4 opens a much more dangerous lane. LAM looks best by a ways, upping my bingo percentage next turn to 49% versus 36% after MALT.

#note smart play by mack to dig into the bag
>JD: ?ACNNSV C9 V.N +10 224
#note I am lucky to have picked up a blank. the most obvious play is to take the points for VANS at L12, but after playing that I foresaw that he would simply block at 3L, leaving me with poor bingo options. therefore I felt that I had to sacrifice the points and play VAN, with the additional potential of a very high-scoring bingo on row 3. after VANS/a block from mack, I would have to bingo to the R on row 10 or through the A on row 13, neither of which score that much, still leaving mack with the tempo on a closed board. However, Quackle suggests in that case that I still bingo 50% of the time, so maybe I simply overestimated the closedness of the board.

#note as mack pointed out after the game, I have REACTIONS here for optimal points, but given the condition of the board I again thought I had to sacrifice the 13 points to keep the board open. after REACTIONS mack will be up 40 with not options for me except a miracle bingo of some sort, or a very low-point fish at the top-right.

#note I saw that WIGEON was my only option just about as soon as I drew my tiles.
>Mack_Meller: DEILMOO F1 OD +19 372
#note Mack's actual rack. he has a really difficult decision on his hands. he played OD as a block that leaves a letter in the bag, but maybe he should empty it to block as much as possible. His play also does not sim that well because of the strong threat of FIREWOOD 3x3. On a sim, quackle also likes semi-fishes like COO at A6, but in practice I should be able to place my bingo so that it blocks whatever he's drawn. The best blocks statistically seem to be MOOLA at B2 or LODGE/MIDGE at 3B, which leave me at about a 40% bingo percentage with a random bag.
