>Matt: AIMOSTU 8G MOU +10 10
#note Oh MIAOU.  Yeah that's better than my choice.
>Dave: ACLM 7F CALM +26 26
>Matt: AAEIIST 9E AIA +10 20
>Dave: EENNOTY J1 NEOTENY +76 102
#note Held briefly on CALMY#, just to be double sure.  CALMIER# and CALMIEST# thankfully have lots of anagrams to associate with.
>Matt: DEIIOST 1C SEDITIO. +80 100
>Dave: DEJTT 3I J.TTED +44 146
>Matt: ?GIKNOT C1 .TOcKING +76 176
>Dave: EOXY E1 .EOXY +32 178
>Matt: ABIPPRS 5I P.BA +16 192
#note Going for rack balance, without giving back big plays in the top right corner.  
>Dave: ENOVW 10B WOVEN +27 205
>Matt: ?FGIPRS 6B F.G +15 207
#note I did consider TREF, but didn't like the PG antisynergy.  But I can make the blank an N, so I'm likely to bingo next turn if I draw a vowel.  It's 15 more points as well.
>Dave: ALOV D10 .OLVA +22 227
>Matt: ?AIPRRS 14C P.ReIRAS +61 268
#note Such a bad play.  I didn't think VOLVA took any back hooks, and in 5-point challenge I couldn't afford to play a phony at this point.  If I know VOLVA takes an S I play RASPIER or ASPIRER.  
>Dave: EGORRS 15A GROSER +44 271
>Dave: EEHINST (challenge) +5 276
#note I was actually sure of GROSER#, but not on VOLVAS, so I challenged.  Having a 70 point Z play in reserve helped make the decision.
>Matt: AEHILRZ H12 ZA.I +69 337
#note Of course, if I had looked further, I might have seen HAZIER 15J scores 89.  Sheesh i played this one badly and was bailed out by good tiles.
>Dave: EEHINST 9I THEINES +68 344
#note Dave did see DISTHENE#, which is very pretty.  Either bingo is likely to get hit back hard though.
>Matt: EEEHLNR 8L HERE +52 389
#note Very lucky to draw all 3 case E's, plus the H for scoring.
>Dave: BCDDIRW 8K W.... +16 360
#note Clever play, although when we discussed this afterwards and perhaps W(E)D is better.  Drawing the case E gives him DESCRIBED as a bingo.  Playing WED, he gets one more shot at the E for ESCRIBED#, which might outrun me depending on what I draw.  
>Matt: AAELNUU 8A LU.E +18 407
#note Wanted to keep one U for the Q in case I draw it.  Champ player suggests ZULU# is the only 100% win, not quite sure what he can have to outrun me though.
>Dave: CDR M1 CR.D +7 367
>Matt: AAINQUU N8 ..QUIN +35 442
#note So flipping lucky this game, it did really feel I didn't play all that well and just got the run of the tiles.
>Dave: BDFIL 13F FL.B +28 395
>Matt: AAU O13 AUA +11 453
#note M12 AUA is one more.  
>Matt:  (DI) +6 459
