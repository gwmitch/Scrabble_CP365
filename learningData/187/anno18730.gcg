>Matt: ELMNOSX 8G LOX +20 20
>Walker: GOV 7H GOV +21 21
>Matt: ADELMNS 6G MAL +19 39
#note A nice looking rack that doesn't do anything on this board.  Quackle wants me to fish off the N or L for 10.  It's pretty defensive if he doesn't have an S, and I should bingo next turn.
>Walker: BCDELOU 5B BECLOUD +84 105
>Matt: EEJNNPS C3 JE.P +26 65
>Walker: FI 4F IF +15 120
#note Guess he missed the hook for LOX.
>Matt: ?ADENNS K7 SpANNED +72 137
#note I saw SCANDENt, but I wanted to take out the easiest bingo lane.  I don't think I realized that it was 10 points more.  I might draw a phony if he tries to S hook it as well.  
>Walker: AOR D3 OR.A +29 149
#note Rightfully punished.

>Walker: EILORSU 11B LOUSIER +70 259
>Matt: DEEFKUV B10 F.UKE +40 302
#note I probably should tack on the D, wasn't 100% of the hook though.
>Walker: AEINOR 1B ORI.ANE +27 286
>Matt: DEGNRTV 12J V.NGED +26 328
#note VERTED# keeping NG?  With 3 I's and a bunch of T's to draw, I can see why that is slightly favored in a sim.
>Walker: EQST 12A Q.EST +56 342
#note This hurt badly.  He almost missed the spot and was vary close to playing something like TUQUE in column D.  
>Matt: DIIMRTY O12 .IDY +27 355
#note 15B DIMITY scores and is a great defensive play, since at this point I have to assume he has the blank.  If he doesn't hit row 2 next turn I might be able to steal this game. My play was autopilot balancing and doesn't really do much towards winning the game.
>Walker: HNT 2H NTH +16 358
>Matt: HIIMRTZ A14 HI +20 375
#note HM instead of HI, but with that unseen pool he is likely bingoing, I just want to make him find it to the Y.
>Walker: ?CENORT 15H ENaCTOR. +89 447
>Walker: A (challenge) +5 452
#note The other bingo is CORNETCY.  I challenge merely in desperation, but I was positive this was good.
>Matt: AIMRTTZ 14H MIZ +70 445
>Matt: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 450
#note But he was kind of enough to give me 5 back on this Collins 3.  
>Walker: A 14N A. +10 462
#note WAWA# is best, but he can't afford a phony.  Not choosing SCANDENt and the DIDY turn were big mistakes that cost me this game.
>Walker:  (ARTT) +8 470
