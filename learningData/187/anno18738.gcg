#note I saw the only two plays worth thinking about (I think), VEE and GROVE. VEE's defense and not-terrible leave make it competitive, but I decided that I wanted to keep the board more open to create more options against a lower-rated player. They sim equally. ZOA suggests nothing in particular.

#note missed ETALON at N2 for the 6-tile overlap, but keeping AELT isn't so bad - 40% bingo chance next turn
>Regenia_Hidalgo: ?ABCERS 12C BACkERS +82 196
#note only 2x2 is ACERBEST
>JD: AEEILOT H11 O.IEL +17 84
#note etoile at O4 is best on pure valuation, but it seemed like I needed to not reset my rack, and this creates some lanes I might need.

>JD: AAEFIRT K5 FA +21 105
#note need to slow the game down, no tafia

>Regenia_Hidalgo: ELT 13B LET +16 266
>JD: DEFIISU 15D DUI +17 171
#note big missed opportunity here, I think the play is definitely DEIFIC trying to open up the board.
>Regenia_Hidalgo: OY N9 OY +15 281
>JD: DEFINRS L8 .NIFED +28 199
#note I didn't really want to play at the bottom-left, but turning over a lot of tiles is also bad news for me at this point. After FID, ENRS bingoes 12% of the time, which is about the best I could hope for. missing DEIFIC looms large.

>JD: ?CHRSTW M12 SH +27 226
#note I think this was my actual rack, frustrating having to play the S but I need some points.

>JD: ?ACRSTW H6 WA. +12 238
#note lucky draw to give myself a half-chance

#note trying to block ELATERIN, no way of winning. but I should play VAN because if I draw the A, then she has...
>Regenia_Hidalgo: EEIINRT D4 I.E +14 407
#note well, she actually had REINCITE but missed it.
>JD: ADENNV 7D DEV +14 365
#note if I think she's going to find ORIENT, I need to play VEND here.
>Regenia_Hidalgo: EINRT 14M ERN +12 419
>JD: ANN 9E NAN +12 377
#note I played better than in my first two losses, but made a couple of errors in the middle that might have cost me.
