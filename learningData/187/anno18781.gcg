#note Missing the anagram, STANDUPS, for 3 more. But after his two fishing plays, maybe it's better not to leave an S in a TWS line?

#note Man, I REALLY didn't know what to do here. I was hesitant to open this board because I had a lead, but I just couldn't find a decent play that didn't open stuff. I was also really worried about what would happen if I walled in this board and then he Q-bombed 10F. So I finally said "to hell with it" and opened this board wiiiide open. A(N)ODIC doesn't open things all that much.

#note If I can block this D and the R down the C column, then Scott is only left with that R in EARTHNUT to bingo through and he will probably score like 60, leaving me in a decent position to win the game anyway. I wasn't totally sure GYROID* was good, but was about 85% sure that it was. Scott held for quite a while but let it go.
