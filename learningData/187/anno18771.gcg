#note I could play through the I but I liked scoring and taking out the PT for scores. Then again GLNT is pretty ugly here. Maybe LAKING?  S hook could trip Terry up, I'm not sure.

#note Interesting. Thought about NEGLECT 5G, NEGLECT C8, TEGG 3A (somehow didn't see GLEG at 3A). I still like this because CENT seems pretty strong for bingos here and I would really like to get a quick bingo down. NEGLECT is not bad either though, opening the board a lot more.

#note I can do something like CL(OY) or L(I) but the advantage of opening a new lane is very real here. Quackle doesn't agree with me (CEINRT sims very highly on bingo percentage) but if I think Terry is going to block a reasonable amount of the time (is this correct?), or not open up (probably likely, though I know nothing about Terry's play style) this seems like a good play.

#note AEMR is a good leave but opening row 15 and blocking row 14 is bad.

#note Played this over pHOEnIX becase it seemed more likely to get a challenge. I could also do HEX because of outbingos but the points for this seem too good.

#note Terry did indeed challenge.
