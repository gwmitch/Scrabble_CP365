#note I liked that this provided some short-term defense while I worked to balance my rack, and set up a TE- play for next turn. Once I hook OFT, hopefully my rack will be a bit better, as it will then open the board.
>Joel_Horn: AEEW 5H AWEE +28 84
#note Starting here, I could tell that Joel was struggling with a bad vowel movement.
>dacrON: EEGLRTV E11 TEG +32 127
#note Again, I knew he had poor tiles, so I'm happy to open this S hook now.

>dacrON: AELRRSV G8 .R +3 130
#note Quackle seems to think I bingo less often with this play than if I just exchange R. This is probably due to Joel's static best plays next turn (for those unfamiliar with Quackle, the static best play is the one which shows up at the top of the "generate choices" list without running a sim. I am pretty confident that this play is better though, as it sets up a spot for the IIIII draw to REVISAL.

#note There's something to be said for playing the bingo at B5, but I would consider it a mistake. This board is an open board whether I like it or not, so I'd rather force him to bingo to an S, as opposed to letting any bingo under the sun down making (ER)E.
>Joel_Horn: ?AEINRT L6 ANTI.ERa +66 166
#note M2 NAsTIER scores more and doesn't open much. Could also go all out and play from M1 banking on Lester's Law of Post Bingo Drek to kick in.

#note This turn presents some issues. On one hand, we're running short on vowels, so my E is now a premium tile. On the other hand, it's going to pretty hard for me to lose this game if I don't open him any big spots. So I'm naturally inclined not to take any of the equity plays here (or the "Quackly plays"). J12 L(U)M or J10 (A)LM(U)D jump out as such plays. I can't see myself making a play other than the one I made, but Quackle, unsurprisingly, doesn't like it. I do also retain DM for a big DIM play beneath QI next turn too if I draw one of the 5 Is but not a bingo. In general, I should be able to bingo one more time and win, but perhaps I should opt for the quicker bingo. I'm open to thoughts here for sure!

#note Unfortunately, now I've run into the vowel shortage, and Quackle is laughing at me. 6L (A)RK doesn't look worth it to me, but I gave serious thought to 2J TRaNK. It's only 33 points, but it gives me 5 new tiles, and keeps the pressure on Joel. I think I should've taken TRaNK, and suspect I overestimated how often I'd bingo after an exchange 4. That's really the question you have to decide in this position though - do you bingo enough after exchanging to hold up your average score after two turns? or does 33 now + next turn's play outweigh that. My guess is that TRaNK + next turn is enough to make playing the blank now worth it, but I definitely stand to score a bit more when I do bingo (say 50% of the time). BTW, I kep NR? over RT? due to TT and no N in the pool. My final verdict is that TRaNK was better, and that this is a mistake.

>dacrON: ?ENORSU A1 URiNOSE +78 374
#note I strongly considered 15L ROUE for 42 holding NS?, but now I'm very scared of the vowel shortage - just IIIOU remaining in a pool of 17 tiles. I think taking the bingo is right here.

>dacrON: GIKORTZ 2A .ITZ +26 400
#note I ran out of time here, and couldn't come up with a good play. This play certainly isn't one. Quackle says 2I KOR.
>Joel_Horn: GILPRTU D2 .IT +24 367
#note 4F TUP is best here for Joel.
>dacrON: GIKOR 15L KOI +24 424
#note 2M GO or GOR are the standouts. I was under 10 seconds, so...yeah.
>Joel_Horn: GLPRU 4G UP +21 388
>dacrON: GR 6L .R +2 426
#note I forgot about P(AVID) under time pressure, so I no longer had my intended outplayed of GR(AVID). I also apparently missed R(YE).
>Joel_Horn: GLR M2 G. +3 391
>dacrON: G J12 G.. +6 432
>dacrON:  (LR) +4 436
#note The other benefit of playing KOI was that Joel was also low on time, and not being able to go out in 2 on my end ended up pushing him one minute over, so I gained 10 extra spread here - final score 436-381. Overall, I was happy with how I settled down after a slightly shaky round one, but definitely could've used more time in the endgame. the DELLMR? rack was also very interesting, as was KLNRRT?
