>Geoffrey: CDIK H7 DICK +22 22
#note Freakin' verties.
>Matt: AGIJNOU 10F JU.ING +36 36
>Geoffrey: ACDEGIL 8E ALG.CIDE +63 85
#note DECALING# is 5 more.
>Matt: ?AAENOT 11E OAT +17 53
#note Didn't want to play NEONATAL, and didn't see the 2 nines, so I went for balancing and scoring.  As it turned out I dodged a killer bullet for just a mortally wounding one.
>Geoffrey: ADEMORS 12F RADOMES +87 172
#note Plays at 12B for 2 more.  Would have 3x3 through NEONATAL.  
>Matt: ?AEENRT M3 EARNEsT +78 131
>Geoffrey: AELO L3 OLEA +18 190
>Matt: BEEGHII 5G BEIGI.. +20 151
#note Autoplayed this.  HEID K5 scores 31, but BEIGIER# provides more volatility while I'm behind, and ditches all my bad tiles.
>Geoffrey: HILW H1 WHIL. +36 226
>Matt: EHMORSU 13I HUMOR +47 198
>Geoffrey: AILRSST 13B TRAILS +30 256
#note I'm assuming he has the second S here.
>Matt: DEFIPSX D12 F.IX +44 242
>Geoffrey: BEINORS B8 BORNI.ES +74 330
#note Not sure if BRIONIES is better or not, but I benefited from his choice.
>Matt: ADEPSTT C3 SPATTED +85 327
#note Wasn't 100% sure of this so I played it quickly; I need it to be good to get back in the game.
>Geoffrey: ANUZ 4A ZU.AN +52 382
>Matt: AENOPRW A1 WAN.E +51 378
#note And this is where I lose the game.  After I hit my clock I realized that I could have played WARZONE#.  That takes the Z spot, scores 6 more, and eliminates the 8A hotspot.  With his next rack, I think I win the game with WARZONE#.
>Geoffrey: EFOQTVV A7 VOTE +42 424
#note His rack is junk without being able to play VOTE.  Threw this game away by playing WANZE#.
>Matt: ENOPRUY J2 POR.Y +25 403
#note Quackle doesn't think I have a win here.  Apparently my best play is UNR(I)PE, setting up HOY next turn, but it's still not enough.  I went to block FIQh#, but PONGY# is better because it's harder to block my outs and play off the Q.
