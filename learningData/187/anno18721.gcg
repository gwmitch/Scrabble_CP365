>JD: ?EEGIKT 8F GEEK +18 18
#note KEG is a 4 point upgrade - better defense + keeping EIT? leads to fewer disaster draws (10% better bingo percentage)
>Rafuncho: DIPUV H3 UPDIV. +15 15
>JD: ?ADILTT 3C ALTIT.De +72 90
>Rafuncho: ABIIM 9I IAMBI +18 33
#note from my (jesse's perspective), giving up a lot of points to open
>JD: AHNOSYZ 4A ZONA +52 142
#note quackle suggests that I average 55 points per turn with HSY after ZONA! (and only 12% bingo percentage)
>Rafuncho: APY 10I PYA +42 75
>JD: ABCHSTY K5 YASH..C +68 210
#note I have YACHT at 2J, but before Rafi played PYA I was considering just BY at 10J, saving ACHST with the hook for IAMBIC and also a potential overlap of AMA/MYC. but this is best.
>Rafuncho: ILOR A4 .ORIL +42 117
>JD: BFJRSTU F2 J.B +28 238
#note could also play JUST at 12I this turn to take out the monster YASHMACS spot, but this takes out a Q and X hotspot.

#note or VETOED
>Rafuncho: AHW L4 HAW +28 326
>JD: EEEGILS 5F EL. +17 473
#note not unreasonable here to try to pick up some extra spread with another bingo, CEE at L12 is the hyper-aggressive choice, but this seemed to combine well with the consonant-heavy pool
>Rafuncho: AINR 6F RA.N +24 350
>JD: EEGISTX E9 SEXT +32 505
#note 4 points better to play GITE at 1G first, since he can block my out of GIE after SEXT by playing GOT at G1.
