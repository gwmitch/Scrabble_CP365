#note I had just looked up FORZANDI/SFORZANDI the day before and had a strong feeling this wasn't good (SFORZATI#) but it seemed worth the try.

>JD: DEEPQUV F3 VEEP +31 188
#note lots of potential for playing the Q off - QUID/QUOD at J1, J9 and now setting up QUOD D2. however, if I play VEEP for 2 less at M2, I save QUAD/QUID/QUOD at F2. sim is basically even.

#note playing the highest-scoring play of ABACK at F10 significantly increases his bingo percentage. the board is very good for me as is. my ACKU has the potential to combine well with the J at D8.

#note the pool is awful, and so he is barely a threat to bingo on column O - I might as well just play TANREC and keep the extra vowel with only 7/22 unseen.
>Max_Panitch: ILLM C1 MILL +22 358
#note scored as 20
>JD: DEEGIRT 1A DE.IT +27 447
#note row 1 has to be blocked because of all the bingos he can have there. emptying the bag with MIDGET loses to the bingos on row 11. TRYPSIN at 15A for 100 is the toughest play for me to outrun, but either RIMED or DEMIT on row 1 usually can outrun even that. The right way to play this pre-endgame is to identify TRYPSIN as the main threat and figure out if I can win with the various draws out of the leftover GINUW.

#note I saw that NIPS was his only out but couldn't figure out how to block it - turns out I have several good ones, specifically HINTER at 12J and RETYING at 11G.
