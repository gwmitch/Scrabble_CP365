>JD: ELMOOQR D2 LOOM +20 48
#note I played up here to keep the board as open as possible (I will be down by a lot by the time I ditch the Q) but quackle is not a huge fan of the extra points I give
>Darrell_Day: DDEILRT 9H TIDDLER +69 169
>JD: EEFIIQR E1 QI +13 61
#note it seemed like time to ditch the Q if I wanted any chance of winning this game, and this also creates a volatile hot spot for potential future use (although there already was one there). Can I really play REFIRE at N9 leaving me down 100 with a 5% bingo chance next turn? REFIRE does leave the board in nice condition for me though.

>Darrell_Day: BJ 11C J.B +24 274
>JD: AEELMTW F10 MEW +27 160
#note given a pretty desperate position, I needed to create the conditions to bingo 2-3 times (maybe a Q play in there too). this leaves my bingo percentage highest for next turn of all plays, but JEWEL at C11 opens a new quadrant of the board (bingoing after MEW might interfere with my lanes on columns L and M). the 3x3 could also potentially get me back in the game instantly. JEWEL is the play.
>Darrell_Day: AELU 1E .UALE +42 316
>JD: AEHLOOT 10J HOOT +37 197
#note hoot does bad things to the board but seems to score too much. it also complicates a potential play by Darrell on column L that could kill all of my lanes simultaneously
>Darrell_Day: EIR G10 IRE +26 342
>JD: AEGLPSX 2J PAX +39 236
#note IRE could've been a setup, but it doesn't really change my play, and if he plays at H12 he will give me new lanes anyway
>Darrell_Day: BTTU H12 BUTT +38 380
>JD: DEGLRSW L8 G..WED +26 262
#note could play just GLOW, but 16 points is helpful

>Darrell_Day: ACDGOY 1K CAGY +29 449
#note an interesting play by darrell - he actually kept OD, so he was saving a big scoring play and block on row 5, but passed up 28 points on this turn to do it? jeez
>JD: ?EGIOTZ 3B ZO. +24 363
#note I actually have a bingo here that I missed (DOGMATIZE) to cut spread. I was focused on creating new lanes, but a fair chance would be to fish for MONAZITE or WURTZITE on row 14. Quackle's top plays involve fishing GO somewhere because I can hit some other Z bingos on row 14 too to cut spread (ZARATITE or FRIZETTE). my play only hits TZIGANES which won't be enough, but it does hit more bingos on row 14 for spread
>Darrell_Day: DFOO 5H FOOD +40 489
>JD: ?EGINOT C11 .ET +22 385
#note ran out of time, technically I should play OOZING because he has KURTA out, but if I expect him to miss it and play JAUK then this is even with my play.
>Darrell_Day: AKRU 4A KA +22 511
>JD: ?GINO 13J cO.ING +14 399
#note GITANO for 5 more, 10 points off on spread
