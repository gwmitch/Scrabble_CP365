>Matt_Graham: DUW I3 WUD +32 32
>Matt_Canik: AAEFHIY G5 FEH +31 77
#note I feel like this is a really defensive play when he doesn't have an A and it sets up my Y. It's leading in a short sim too. 
>Matt_Graham: ABIN F6 BANI +29 61
>Matt_Canik: AAEIILY E8 ALIYA +20 97
>Matt_Graham: GINOPRU D2 POURING +80 141

>Matt_Graham: EFORR 12H FRORE +33 174
>Matt_Canik: BEPQRTT 14F PERT +30 202
#note One of my favorite plays of the tournament. This sets up Q(A)T for 51. 
>Matt_Graham: EM 15G ME +38 212
>Matt_Canik: ?ABHQTT 12D Q.T +51 253
#note Yessss
>Matt_Graham: EMOO B10 MOO.E +26 238
>Matt_Canik: ?ABDHTT A7 BATH +34 287
#note Elected to play this instead of BAHT for 2 more because this does better things for ?DT as a leave... is that worth 2 points though? I also missed an 8 this turn... props to you if you saw it.
>Matt_Graham: GINOO 8H .OOING +10 248
#note The 8 was BuTTH(E)AD
>Matt_Canik: ?DGTTVV -DGTVV +0 287
#note That is certainly not the draw I wanted into DT?
>Matt_Graham: EJO B6 JOE +32 280
>Matt_Canik: ?ILSSTZ 2B ZI. +28 315
#note Should I put down an S here? Should I close off my bingo lines with a ply like ZIT(I)?
>Matt_Graham: AEKOW L3 AWOKE. +26 306
>Matt_Canik: ?DILSST E2 SIT +22 337
#note I see D(I)STILLS/BANIS* but am pretty sure I remem ber BANI not taking an S... I choose this because I don't think it telegraphs an S nearly as much as other plays. 
>Matt_Graham: AGT K3 TAG +21 327
#note Matt spent a REALLY long time on this turn...
>Matt_Canik: ?DELNST 10D L.STeNED +71 408
>Matt_Canik: ?DELNST --  -71 337
#note ...during which I spent myself thinking more and more about BANIS* until finally I decided it was good. Goddamnit me. This is such a bad decision. I shouldn't base my plays on whether or not I think a word is good. In this position, I'm up 10 and a tempo with a blank on my rack. I don't need to gamble. 
>Matt_Graham: DLUV G1 LUV +23 350
#note Matt said he could play something down M1 for more points, but he didn't believe in playing the word GOD unless he really had to. 
>Matt_Canik: ?DELNST M2 DENT +26 363
#note This is the part where I self-destruct because I'm so pissed at myself for the BANIS* decision. 
>Matt_Graham: ADELN 11J LADEN +21 371
>Matt_Canik: ?CDLRSV 13L VaCS +23 386
#note If playing LADENS could have won me the game, I think I'd have tried it. But it can't.
