>Lisa: BFI 8G FIB +16 16
#note Warning! If you don't like the sight of blood, turn back here. I bleed/spew equity like a fire hose in this one. Let's see if I can still pull it out...
>Chris: CEIJLNO 7F JO +16 16
#note This is pretty strong defense and keeps the strongest leave. I like this play.
>Lisa: MOY 9I YOM +23 39
>Chris: ACEILNO 8K OLEIC +28 44
#note ENCO(M)IA 2x2 for 44! If I'm going to miss that, ENOLIC 10I scores better, blocks the potential X setup, and doesnt open lanes. No idea why I failed so hard here - OLEIC didn't feel right as I played it either :(
>Lisa: EHP 10H PEH +37 76
#note It wasn't the X, but very deserved.
>Chris: AIINNTW 7K NAW +26 70
#note Played this really fast after wasting time with OLEIC. It sims best, but I don't like IINT that much. I'd have played INTWINE or PANINI if I'd taken more time here, I think.
>Lisa: AT 7F ..TA +24 100
>Chris: ?AIINST O8 .ANITIeS +80 150
#note I saw ISATINIC and would have played it if my confidence wasn't in a weird place and if I didnt have a slightly worse bingo available. Sigh lol :P
>Lisa: AGP 6L GAP +22 122
#note Setting up the 5 line with EGAL, as Lisa is now behind. It sets up the O1-O6 scoring spot too, although if its taken, it will open more lanes for her. This looks like a good strategic choice.
>Chris: EEIIMNN O1 MEINIE +34 184
#note ISATINIC would have prevented the board from being this open, of course
>Lisa: DFIRT 9C DRIFT +19 141
#note Blowing the board wide open. I weakly inferred consonants because she had IF or DIF at 9E/10E if not.
>Chris: ?DKLNSV E8 K.ND +18 202
>Lisa: ACEORST 15H COASTER. +83 224
#note ISATINIC nooo :(
>Chris: ?LORSTV 12A VOLTS +34 236
#note I looked over a bit over a minute, but this is clear.
>Lisa: EHU 14J HUE +31 255
>Chris: ?ABERUY A12 .ARY +30 266
#note Passed up BREA(K) on purpose, but it looks like i misevaulated how salvageable the leave (UY?) is. The sim likes just AY/ADRIFT, which is deceptively good defensively. I kinda like it. 
>Lisa: AVW B8 VAW +27 282
>Chris: ?BDEIUZ K11 ZEB.. +32 298
#note Setting up a huge AX spot for no reason. BIZE I5 shuts stuff down and gives me a small lead, with the blank. If I want to keep it open, L11 ZIBET is clearly superior. No idea what I was doing here...
>Lisa: AGLOU 14A .UGOLA +18 300
>Chris: ?ADLOUU N10 ULU +13 311
#note I didn't want to play UDO N1 because of my blank. I was worried a bit about a Q stick after spending both U's with ULU, but I figured my blank could bail me out if absolutely necessary and it was the best way to bingo fast before the board got closed down.
>Lisa: DEGO 5I DOGE +17 317
#note I thought this was a weird-looking play.
>Chris: ?DINOTX 2I OXIDaT. +60 371
#note I considered XI 15D but not OXID 15C! I wanted to give her only one chance of beating me (bingoing out right now), but keeping the blank and scoring 45 often allows me to outscore even if she does bingo, I think.
>Lisa: AEEIRRR J1 E. +9 326
#note I draw the Q and it gets stuck! I should have enough of a lead though...
>Chris: EENNQS 8A E.E +21 392
#note -2 to ES 11H and NENES 1G? according to Q (?)
>Lisa: AR L11 AR +19 345
#note I thought about blocking this spot on the last turn but couldnt score anything there.
>Chris: NNQS I7 ....S +10 402
#note I think the endgame moves might be slightly screwed up or misattributed; doesn't affect the result though
>Lisa: EIRR 4L RE +16 361
>Chris: NNQ J5 .N +4 406
>Lisa: IR C6 IR.. +6 367
>Lisa:  (NQ) +22 389
#note I ended with just the Q being suck, so something went wrong in the annotation, but whatever. Managed to undeservingly win this game - that's what champions are made of though hehe :)
