>Jim_Kramer: EOORW 8D WOOER +24 24
#note some key games down the stretch! nothing like the adrenalin rush of being in contention at nationals.
>JD: IIJLMQS I6 QIS +22 22
#note I can also just exchange, but I thought QIS had enough defensive value (drops his bingo percentage from 21 to 14%) to be worth playing. basically a dead heat with JISM, but it seemed worth taking my chance to ditch the Q this turn.
>Jim_Kramer: ?AAITUY H8 .UbAIYAT +83 107
#note nice play!
>JD: CIJLLMO E5 MOJ. +26 48
#note quackle dings MOJO for giving up too many points...but...surely the whole point is to make the board volatile! I'm already down a lot.
>Jim_Kramer: AELN G12 LANE +17 124
>JD: BCIILLS J5 BI +19 67
#note this is a pretty bad play. I figured I needed some gambling play that open the board further, but the leave after BI is too ugly and doesn't really bingo much. a good option would be CIBOL at 6B which scores a little, cleans up my rack and takes away some cheap points for him at F6.
>Jim_Kramer: ELRRU F2 RULER +17 141
>JD: CEILLPS 11H .LLSPICE +74 141
#note lucky
>Jim_Kramer: GHIINOT K8 HOI.TING +62 203
#note he missed lithoing for 19 more!
>JD: ADEEHTV O7 HEAV.D +45 186
>Jim_Kramer: ?DKNOUY N2 UNYOKeD +105 308
>JD: DEEITWZ D4 ZED +35 221
#note I thought ZED here might prevent him from blocking the R. a play I love but didn't come up with at the time is TIDEWAY on row 13, with a shot at a big Z play at B10 next turn, opening an otherwise dead quadrant. either way it would take a lot to come back from this spot.
>Jim_Kramer: ABF F13 FAB +29 337
>JD: AEEITWX 9G X. +34 255
#note I needed to slow the game down, and it seemed that I could hit some bingos on column 2 that could open the game up - WASTERIE, WAITERED, WATERIER, and maybe GWINE for some points with an N draw. he will probably block column L next turn. quackle likes WAXIER at 2A which does threaten an unlikely triple-triple, but I thought I needed to slow things down.
>Jim_Kramer: AAGNPS K1 PANGAS +38 375
>JD: AEEINTW 15K .WINE +39 294
#note he actually held on this plan for a few seconds
>Jim_Kramer: EORU E10 EURO +18 393
>JD: ACEENST 2A CENTA.ES +70 364
>Jim_Kramer: AOT 1H ATO. +24 417
#note he must have had all of the vowels at this point and known that there was nothing I could draw.
>JD: DEMRRTV 2J M.D +22 386
#note my best endgame, threatening an out but also keeping some scoring plays in reserve.
>Jim_Kramer: EFGIIOT C5 FOG +23 440
#note he should just play FOG at M7
>JD: ERRTV 13J R.VET +16 402
#note one worse than TRIER, I saw TRIER but forgot that VEX is now unblockable.
>Jim_Kramer: EIIT A1 I.E +15 455
>JD: R G7 R.. +11 413
#note did close some spread, hitting a bingo through the R sooner or maybe TIDEWAY could've made it more interesting
>JD:  (IT) +4 417
