#note I can't say I was expecting him to challenge, but I think he got confused with POOFY/POUFY*

#note I thought about MYOBLAST since I thought it could draw a challenge, but not worth it with JQ?? out there. he held this play for a bit

>JD: BDEHILN 12D EDH +28 280
#note I should probably just take the points, but with both blanks unseen it seemed wise to start closing the board. the bottom-left will be a bit tricky to open for him from now on. it does drop his bingo percentage from 16% to 13%.
>Orry: AFMR 14C FARM +38 202
>JD: BIIKLNT I3 KN.T +13 293
#note am I channeling my inner conrad here too much? I figured KNIT would make it just about impossible to bingo, but I am passing up 14 points and a better leave compared to just playing BLIND. A saner alternative would be BINIT at 4E, which only leaves a lame IDS lane for him to work with and also flips over 5 tiles in search of a blank.
>Orry: DDO 14L ODD +30 232
>JD: BCIILLW 3F WIC. +14 307
#note if I'm continuing with my defensive efforts, a nice choice is BLINI at 4F which looks a little better.
>Orry: ANY N11 .AN.Y +22 254
>JD: ABGILLR 2C GLIAL +17 324
#note I thought GLIAL was a pretty reasonable solution to my circumstances, but quackle points out ALCID at H1, which scores 13 extra and leaves an airball of a lane at 1H.
>Orry: EEOR N2 ERO.E +20 274
>JD: ??ABIQR 15A QuA +38 362
#note a ridiculous draw after spending the last 5 turns futzing around ineffectually.
