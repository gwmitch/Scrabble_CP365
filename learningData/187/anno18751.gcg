>Joshua_Sokol: DHILQTY H8 QI +22 22
#note There are many reasons to make this play. Some of them have merit, some do not, and I'll save the dissonance-based reasoning for another time on why I made this play. You can ask me personally if you'd like. I will say that I still love that I made this play and that I think it is, in fact, better than the other placement(s). 
>Jason_Keller: CEIMPRU G9 PUMICER +76 76
#note I held this but recognized it! Go me!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDHLTY 15E HA.DLY +39 61
#note I have missed HYD(R)A many times
>Jason_Keller: INOV I7 VINO +29 105
>Joshua_Sokol: EOORTY J9 TYRO +34 95
#note Not sure of my last tile. 
>Jason_Keller: AHMST 14J MATHS +45 150
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEFNOR 14F F. +26 121
#note uNFOR(C)ED and eNFOR(C)ED were missed. There is no reason not to play FROUN(C)ED or UNFOR(C)ED. Large error number 2. (QI doesn't and will NEVER count as an error!)
>Jason_Keller: ELW 12I L.WE +14 164
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEENOR M6 ENcORED +68 189
#note L(O)WE was a weird play, but I inferred one-pointers from it. I think I still agree with that inference, so leaving that E at M6 seems like a benefit rather than a bad thing a great deal of the time. The only scoring tile I can see Jason keeping with L(O)WE is another W, and I tried to imagine him keeping an X to make sure ENcORED was OK and I couldn't imagine it. The safe option is REzONED in the same spot, although that increases his bingo chances for next turn.
>Jason_Keller: LU 11E LU. +10 174
#note The X threat this opens is less of a problem due to the one I opened last turn, but it's still going to be a variance-inducer. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEGKT D8 KEDGE +39 228
#note It was between KEDGE and GEEKED. I laid KEDGE down quickly cause of its anti-bingo defense and overall equity, and because I was unsure of GEEKED. GEEKED is probably still worth considering but KEDGE seems better still. I unfortunately forgot about K3 as a bingo lane, but there isn't anything I can do about it after LU(M).
>Jason_Keller: EEILNST K3 LENITES +71 245
#note This looks like a play that makes drawing the X one of the most important factors in the rest of the game, which may be something Jason wants. I'm not sure. The other dangerous 74-pointers at N1 (TENSILE, SETLINE and LISENTE) fork scoring spots pretty well, L1 being more dangerous than O7, but I think they do a better job for Jason at maintaining scoring and a lead on his end. But perhaps Jason thinks he's more likely to outplay me after LENITES. I don't know. I think I would play a 74-pointer here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEFGT N6 FA +28 256
#note I didn't like this, but it seemed like my best play. I felt like I needed to keep scoring, and that the spot FA opened wasn't terribly dangerous. I also have TE to overlap FA, which means I have almost a guaranteed shot at O8 or O1 next turn if Jason doesn't make use of the spot. Otherwise my bingo% is higher after FA than after the other play I considered, L1 FEAT, for the same amount, although so is Jason's. His rack after LENITES is completely random so I should think that it's a bit worse than average given the pool, and that my leave is around average. What do you think? FA or FEAT? Something else?
>Jason_Keller: ADGJO O7 GADJO +46 291
#note damn, that's unfortunate.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGNPT 8A PEA. +30 286
#note I forgot the fact that AGNT is better than EGNT, but even if I had remembered I might have still played PEAK given that there is AAAA unseen vs EE. But it seems misled to do so, since after PEE(K) there are no duplicate A's to play through over the board, just E's, so EGNT, despite likely drawing into more 7s, draws into around 5% fewer bingos in total than AGNT after PEAK vs PEEK. 
>Jason_Keller: OX J5 OX +52 343
#note Damn, he hit it
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGINOT B8 .GEsTION +70 356
#note This seems better than 3G TOwE(L)ING as it scores 2 points better and leaves Jason with fewer scoring options next turn, but maybe, since I am still down a tempo after this bingo, I should still play TOwE(L)ING. Jason's rack is pretty random save a lesser chance of many consonants or a B, given that OX vs F10 X(U) infers more vowels and OX vs BOX J4 infers no B. So perhaps he's therefore vowel-heavy and TOwE(L)ING is therefore the right play since he won't usually be able to score well afterwards.
>Jason_Keller: AIN A13 ANI +19 362
#note Seems my previous analysis was correct. EGESTION now looks like a small error.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAERSUV 4I UV.A +27 383
#note Not much to say against this play. It does everything right.
>Jason_Keller: IO 15L OI +11 373
#note Jason was hoping to draw an S at this point, or some other way of scoring, but it's looking grim for him, especially since he isn't playing more than two or three tiles at once. I think he mentioned having the Z in hand for many of the last moves of the game. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ABERRST E2 BARTERS +79 462
#note And I hit a bingo due to two fortunate draws! Between playing BARTERS and BARRETS, the latter allows a very small increased bingo % for Jason next turn, putting the R at 5E instead of the T, which is the only way I lose the game after this. So BARTERS is a better play (not that I actually knew that, it just seemed intuitive).
>Jason_Keller: AIINOUZ D2 AZO +43 416
#note apparently this is wrong, but that's only in theory.
>Joshua_Sokol: BCERSTW 2B SC..BER +38 500
>Joshua_Sokol: BCERSTW --  -38 462
#note Between SW(AB)BER and SC(AB)BER,  SC(AB)BER seemed much more likely to be a word. I have nothing to lose, so I tried it. It really sounded like a word to me for some reason. SW(AB)BER is actually a word though, and that makes no sense to me :/
>Jason_Keller: IINU C8 .IN +13 429
#note -12 in theory again
>Joshua_Sokol: BCERSTW 6C CR.W +17 479
#note -2 to W(E)B in the same spot. 
>Jason_Keller: IU A7 U. +4 433
>Joshua_Sokol: BEST B3 BETS +20 499
#note I started off very clumsily, but ended up playing alright and drawing even better. Jason was obviously very distraught about losing this game after my first play!
>Joshua_Sokol:  (I) +2 501
