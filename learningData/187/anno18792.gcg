>Matt_Canik: EINPSUV H8 UP +8 8
#note Another really touh opening position for me this tounament. Exch. UV, UP, and VENUS were the three options I thought of. Q says I've made the right choice- this is up a point on exchanging UV and 7 points on VENUS.

>Matt_Canik: ?AABDNS K4 iNDABAS +76 114
#note 5 sevens in this rack. I saw one and quit looking. Can you find the others? 
>Nigel_Peltier: ORRU 8K .URRO +24 72
#note SANDBAR, SANDBAG, SANDDAB, BANDSAW
>Matt_Canik: GGILMNT 4G MILT.NG +20 134
#note Didn't know GLIMING, but that's far superior here. There's no good reason for me to fish now. 
>Nigel_Peltier: AQ J2 QA. +32 104
>Matt_Canik: ABCGHIO 13B GOB +30 164
#note Q thinks I should play BIOG instead. I guess I'm not really giving him high scoring plays that often. 
>Nigel_Peltier: IWY N6 WI.Y +18 122
>Matt_Canik: AACEEHI 3C AECIA +21 185
>Nigel_Peltier: EX 4C EX +38 160
>Matt_Canik: AEEHRTZ B4 HAZE +49 234
#note I pretty much have to play HAZE or HAZER this turn. But which one? HAZE could give up big HAZER/HAZEL plays but holds better. A sim thinks I've made the right call. Does him being bingo-prone make this play better (less likely to have high scorers) or worse (more likely to have the bingo-prone R and L)?
>Nigel_Peltier: IPU A7 PIU +19 179
#note Lucked out bigtime here. 
>Matt_Canik: EEEFRTY I3 F.YER +25 259
#note Wanted to kill this D. F(L)EY will hold better to stop me from drawing into some thorny situations. 
>Nigel_Peltier: AO M7 O.A +14 193
>Matt_Canik: AEEIMOT 12G IOTA +8 267
#note Nigel really has one good bingo line left, and that's 12G. Locking that down puts this game more or less on autopilot. But I just couldn't find a good word to block without allowing more overlaps. I eventually decided on IOTA because he won't be able to underlap the T with an E (yet), and there are very few As and Is and Os left. 
>Nigel_Peltier: ?AERSST 14B oSSETRA +87 280
#note Tough call here for Nigel- score 7 less for (O)SSATuRE or give up this big spot?
>Matt_Canik: EEEHLMW 15H WHELM +63 330
#note Took a lot of guts for me to play this because I was unsure of the validity and WHEEL is still 51 points. Basically if this isn't good, I lose this game. 
>Nigel_Peltier: R G2 R.. +5 285
>Matt_Canik: EEEIKNO 2A OINK +33 363
>Nigel_Peltier: DDI 1G DID +22 307
>Matt_Canik: EEEEILU 14K EEL +9 372
#note Drawing all these vowels is one of the best things that could have happened to me here, because now I know Nigel has a horrible rack. I blocked this out of paranoia that I had mistracked and he could hit INVENTS or something.
