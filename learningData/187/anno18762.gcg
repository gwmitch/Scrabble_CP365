>JD: ACDEFIU 10F DEF +39 301
#note not an obvious play. quackle has a couple of alternatives to the greedy play of DEF - LUDE at 10D and ADDUCE at 14B. The value of ADDUCE lies in pursuing one of the blanks. There are also two Us remaining and no Q, which makes DEF a bit worse. I think LUDE looks reasonable. I might be able to lock up the board with a 40 point lead starting next turn, and it takes away a lot of cheap points on row 10.
>Leesa: IILRY C11 LIRI +19 269
#note she flashed ILY by putting down INLY at 4L and picking it up. there's actually a spot for INLY at C6, so it seems I really lucked out.
>JD: AACEIUU B13 EAU +17 318
#note well, this is why LUDE would've been worthwhile. she just showed me that she has a Y, so I think that I have to block over here. EAU's defensive value seems sufficient to make it better than exchanging 7 (definitely the best exchange in the circumstances). EAU might well be the best play even had I played LUDE last turn.
>Leesa: XY 15A X. +27 296
#note I could tell something unusual was going on on this play. she really agonized over dropping the X here. this play exposes an unusual amount of information - she can't have an A, E or O or she would've played at N5. maybe an all-consonant rack with a blank?
>JD: ABCINSU 13H BUS.IC +31 349
#note I know that she's still holding a Y, likely at least one blank and no vowels before her last play - this definitely seemed best to take out the last good lane on row 14.
>Leesa: UY H13 .UY +24 320
#note I didn't count on her having the U! oh well.
>JD: AEEFNOT L3 FOE +23 372
#note I was undecided on FETA at K1 versus FOE at L3. FETE has the advantage of flipping an extra tile (though she may already have both blanks) and blocking the ER, but I thought that FOE would make it harder for her to fish on column N. FOE also keeps a more balanced leave that could come in handy with an ugly pool remaining. still unsure.
>Leesa: ??LRSSW 4B WRaSSLe.. +70 390
>Leesa: ??LRSSW --  -70 320
#note she has wrassle at N9 but must have thought that it didn't take the S! she thought she was playing WRASSLER* which is also phony.
>JD: AEHIKNT 4D THINK.. +38 410
#note difficult position for me - I have to come up with a plan of action that will help me outrun her (unclear if she will play WRASSLE or not, I actually hadn't even seen it). I went greedy for the points here, but quackle suggests making a shorter play that saves some of the nice scoring tiles, and let her draw some of the uglier stuff in the bag when she bingos. for instance, I can play TAKIN at C3 to keep the H, or even just INK. if I predicted her next move, then there's a ton of value to playing THEIN at C3, but I did not anticipate correctly...
>Leesa: ??LRSSW 6M .L +4 324
#note I could've held the K for this turn if this is what I expected her to do, but then again she could just as easily have tried wrassle.
>JD: AEGOORT 5C GOO +20 430
#note a lucky draw for me to pick up three consonants. I decided to try to outrun, but quackle likes GO at N3 to interfere with the highest-scoring bingos on the right and keep a decent leave. another suggestion that looks good is TOGAE at 3A, after which I get to play to the triple if she bingos. but this way, if she bingos next turn, I get to win an endgame where I have a slight lead and tempo.

>JD: AAEERTW 3E WAE +21 451
#note AE at 3F is best by 3, setting up WATER to go out.
