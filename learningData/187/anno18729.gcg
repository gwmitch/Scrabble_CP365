#title 2014 NSC Round 13
#description Jesse Day plays Kolton Koehler in Round 13 at the 2014 NSC
>Jesse: GILOSUW 8G WIG +14 14
#note This game was annotated at Table 1 in round 13 of the 2014 NSC.
>Kolton: ALLNOST H3 STALL.ON +59 59
>Jesse: ILOPSUX 6H .UX +26 40
#note wide open board, much better to save the bingo leave
>Kolton: DEEEHIM K3 HEME +29 88
#note HEME at K5 is a bit better defensively
>Jesse: AILOPRS L1 PIAL +27 67
#note tough to be sure that I wasn't missing something with this rack. POLIS for 12 extra wins the sim by 3 points, with the extra defensive value (not hanging the P in the triple lane) explaining most of the difference.
>Kolton: DEIINVY 1L .INY +27 115
>Jesse: AEGOORS 10C OREGA.OS +65 132
>Kolton: DEIIOUV 3B DEVIOU. +24 139
>Jesse: ??CGHIT O1 .aCHTInG +107 239
#note ridiculous draw
>Kolton: ADEEIRT 5J E. +13 152
#note I don't like Kolton's fish on this board with a shortage of good lanes - DEVA is a nice suggestion, since it distracts me and allows him to bingo at 11I or through OREGANOS. he has to figure that I will block the ORE next turn if I can.
>Jesse: EFJOOPY 9C JOY +45 284
>Kolton: ADEIRRT D1 DI.ERT +24 176
#note he's in a lot of trouble now - maybe IRID at 2J to create a nice lane and hope that I can't do much to block?
>Jesse: AEEFOPQ 1A FEO. +24 308
#note a fun play because I am 5/40ish on each tile I flip to pull QI or QUA at the right to increase spread, and he won't block since he would like to draw the Q himself. also, the P fits nicely at 11E, so I have a nice shot of scoring next turn even if I don't hit my Q play.
>Kolton: AAEFNRR D8 F..ERAN +28 204
#note great idea by kolton!
>Jesse: AEENPQT 11B NE.P +38 346
#note even though I have QAT for 40, this still sims best, flipping more tiles to hit on the right. If I assume he has the K (no guarantee) then playing PET at C13 to block sims even with NEEP.
>Kolton: ABDKMRR 15A MARK +65 269
>Jesse: AADEQTV 6B QA. +32 378
#note I ran out of scoring plays to make holding the Q, but then I missed QAT at F6! I had taken a lot of time on FEOD
>Kolton: BDIIRSW 7A DIB +27 296
>Jesse: AADENTV 13C V.NADATE +80 458
>Kolton: ABCIRSW J10 .CR.W +18 314
#note he should probably just cut spread and play WABS, he has nice bingo chances after that anyway
>Jesse: EIOSTUZ 15G OUTSIZE +139 597
#note ouch!
>Kolton: ABIORST N10 BOARTS +45 359
>Jesse: ELNU -  +0 597
#note I challenged because there's huge incentive for me to pick up spread - I thought OUTSIZE might be an adjective, in which case  I would go out and pick up 45 extra spread. my best endgame play is actually to play EL at M3 and let him go out (1 better than playing LUNE)
>Kolton: I F13 .I +4 363
>Kolton:  (ELNU) +8 371
