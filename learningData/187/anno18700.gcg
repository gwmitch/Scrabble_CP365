#note I was't thrilled with sacrificing points to play YE here. To me the options were either MY or EYEN but YE sims best handily. It seems highly counter-intuitive that I would bingo 25% of the time next turn with EIMNT+2. It looks much likelier that I'll draw something that scores 30 or so: EMETIN/YETI/ON 11J, OMENTA and a couple other things from O10, etc. After going through the sim log, I see stuff like MANNITE goes down at 6F, and a lot of the bingos I get after YE hook YETT with my T (EMINENT, REMINTS, etc). A bunch of things play from O1 as well, so maybe that leave is just deceptively (to me) good on the post-YE board?

>Will: AIIMQTY 10B QA. +32 220
#note I was sorely tempted to play C10 AMITY and maybe luck into SUQ for 60+, but decided to play it safer - I didn't consider just MITY, leaving a much nicer followup QAT and maybe a U since they're all left to draw. Also didn't give enough thought to 5J YAM/MAY, just to stop Joe from scoring a bundle there. Didn't maximize my chances here.

>Joe: AOV 4L AVO +30 280
>Will: DEIMNSY O1 YINS +32 284
#note I played YINS over YIDS to keep the D hook for RAG, but I guess I didn't consider that MYOID keeps a dynamite leave with which I can hook SAX.
>Joe: UUV -UUV +0 280
#note Joe drew UUV after AVO and traded it.
>Will: ADEMRST 4D SMARTED +78 362
#note I drew RATS after YINS. Better lucky than good, I suppose.
>Joe: EHRZ H1 HER.Z +51 331
>Will: EEGHPTV 2C VEGET. +12 374
#note Wow, VEGETE sims horrendously. I guess by playing normally and doing 11J VEG keeping nice scoring tiles I can probably outrun most bingos anyway whereas after VEGETE practically any bingo no matter how weak in the lower part of the board puts me in a bind, but I stand by this as a decent idea. If Joe can't bingo next turn he's in major trouble.

#note PIKER is better. In spite of myself, I finished top 5 yet again - only player to do that two years running!
