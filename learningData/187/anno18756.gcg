#title 2014 NSC Round 15
#description Joel Sherman plays Jesse Day in Round 15 at the 2014 NSC
>Joel: AETUWWY -AETUWWY +0 0
#note This was the annotated game in round 15 of the 2014 NSC. quackle prefers taking the 18 points.
>Jesse: ADEENNO 8H ONE +6 6
#note leave isn't good enough to play short and the exchange says nothing about his rack, might as well take the 12 extra points for DONNEE
>Joel: BEEIIRS H7 B.ISERIE +61 61
>Jesse: ADEIMNP G12 AMP +23 29
#note many options, AMP looks as reasonable as anything. trying to keep things open but also take away a little bit of the sting of BOISERIES if he had it.
>Joel: ?EHTTWZ 15H sTEW +48 109
#note a classic joel play - it was good to see the blank come out, lthough I figured he had the other at first
>Jesse: DDEINOO 11D DIOD. +23 52
#note rack was misannotated at the time as DDEEINO. DODO was unappealing with my inference of him potentially having the other blank. sims very close also with DO at 14J. I thnk this play does a better job of opening the board.
>Joel: FHLLRTZ E8 THR.LL +9 118
>Jesse: CEEKNOS 12A KNEE. +34 86
#note it was nice to have a faster move
>Joel: EFLLSTZ J6 FL.ET +18 136
>Jesse: CGGIORS 8A GIGO. +24 110
>Joel: CLNSUYZ L12 LUNY +36 172
>Jesse: CDRSTTW 13K D.CT +14 124
#note almost a forced move at this point
>Joel: CFMPQSZ -CFMQ +0 172
>Jesse: EORSTWY 14J YO. +34 158
>Joel: AENPSVZ N10 VEN.S +32 204
#note again, a bit paranoid - joel is giving up a lot of points to do this when the rest of the board is quite open.
>Jesse: AEORSTW O14 OW +17 175
#note I have some interesting defensive fishes I could make here like WOK, WON or NOW to prevent him from killing be at the bottom-left, where all his best scoring plays are.
>Joel: AACEIPZ A12 .APA +30 234
#note leaving a bit of an unflexible leave
>Jesse: AAEGRST F2 TEARGAS +72 247
#note seemed much better defensively than gastrea at K!
>Joel: ACEIUVZ 4B VACU. +20 254
#note a difficult play for him that sims quite well - quackle also lies CURVE at 5D, but this leads to a much more defensive configuration
>Jesse: ?ABEMNR 3E m.MBRANE +66 313
#note a big mistake, I was pressed for time and looking only for bingos without realizing that I could score very well and keep the blank (MANNER or BANNER). then again, I knew that MEMBRANED was good, which he might not.
>Joel: EFHIIOZ 4L FIZ +40 294
#note tough decision for him, I was certainly aware of the possibility of a killer Z play at 2J and surprised that he ditched it here. I guess he could've been fishing for HONIED and also trying to take out the heft of the MEMBRANES/MEMBRANED spot
>Jesse: AINRTUX N4 .AX +35 348
#note this is a fascinating pre-endgame. I played ZAX to take some points and stop him from killing me with the membrane hooks, but I missed a lovely opportunity - simply playing AN at 5N to set up a huge XU for next turn that would be a major pain to block. a classic nigel richards-esque play! I wish that I had seen it under the time pressure. my win percentage drops from 90+% to 80% as a result.
>Joel: ADEHIOO B10 HO.IED +49 343
>Jesse: INORTUU 2J TURION +28 376
#note my last draw was nonideal, but I still found a play here which wins 24/36 - TURION, giving me a win as long as I can draw an out to my U. it seemed at the time that this was my only chance. given the actual pool before HONIED, I am 13/21 to win.
>Joel: AEIJORS B2 JI.E +28 371
#note he actually came very close to blowing the endgame because he didn't see my QI spot for 21. I saw his best sequence of ARVOS at B2.
>Jesse: IQU 9G Q. +21 397
>Joel: AORS 6A OSAR +23 394
>Joel:  (IU) +4 398
