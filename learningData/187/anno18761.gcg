#note a very delicate play, my leave will be terrible whatever I play so I should try to be defensive. quackle thinks that FEM at N1 is defensive enough to be worth playing - I suppose that if he plays at O1 I will take L3, and vice-versa.

#note another mistake - TENON flips over a bunch of new tiles, much more likely to be useful than my rack of NNOV

#note difficult choice between this or JUBES/NOS

#note I thought ATILT might be CSW, but didn't hold Jerry
>JD: CDEINSV 2M ..D +14 112
#note I liked the defensive fish here going for EVINCES and INVECTS* (yes, it's not a word), but quackle thinks it's pretty dreadful compared to VICE. I agree.

#note he said later that he could've just played to the right, so I was very lucky here

#note only bingo, he held for a bit

#note I was trying to put some time pressure on him, almost palyed WHOP instead of WHOMP

#note a really tough decision, but all the rest of the lanes on the board are so much worse. it seemed that I would have to outrun this lane every turn for the rest of the game, and he can score a lot of points here too. but maybe I overvalued its significance - his bingo percentage doesn't change with EFT at 11K versus playing TAE. Evidently he already has plenty of bingo lanes to work with. In any case, well-played by Jerry to draw me into an apparent mistake.

#note quackle loves keeping the Z here by playing FIE somewhere, but again, I thought I had to cut into his bingo lanes at least a bit.
>Jerry_Lerman: CILOOS B2 COOLIS. +28 265
#note interesting play!
>JD: AEEEFRY 15B REEFY +30 329
#note this play leaves him with some bingo lanes to worth with - I have to balance trying to ourhim with blocking. REEFER at 13H blocks a lot, but might have trouble outrunning a bingo. quackle's ultimate favorite is YEA at C3 to pick up some extra points and keep a leave that can score well after a bingo.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?AGILPS 2A S.ALPInG +64 329
#note quackle really likes fishing again even though he can play scaling this turn, but the problem if he does is that I can play on the bottom-right and block most of his lanes. seems worth a try for him to bingo
