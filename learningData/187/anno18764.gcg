>JD: AEMQRRY 8D MERRY +26 26
#note dead heat between the 8D and 8H placements (QA > QE), I played it at 8D to keep the board more closed since my leave will probably be bad for a few turns.
>Kolton: AMNOO D7 A.MONO +20 20
>JD: ?AAFLPQ C4 FLAP +19 45
#note I am surprised by how many viable options there are here. they range from burning the blank for FAQiR, to exchanging AFQ, or just playing FA at E10 to keep the board closed. on a 2-ply sim they are all close, but a longer 4-ply sim (reasonable because it might better account for the value of the blank and Q on ths board) FA at E10 takes the lead. by keeping the board tight I can dump the Q and then likely bingo anyway. a non-intuitive play.

#note of course, quackle can't account for the odds of a ridiculous ESSU draw

#note kolton mentioned some particularly skilful bad draws in this section

>Kolton: CEOO H4 COOE. +13 97
>JD: DILOTUZ 6H .UZO +33 235
#note I didn't see an alternative to opening the board with OUZO, but quackle really likes LUTZ at 3D, and for good reason - it kills by far his best bingo line, and scores decently. I would like to have played LUTZ.
>Kolton: DW I5 W.D +19 116
>JD: DIILORT K3 LIR.T +10 245
#note these plays aren't always the easiest to find but I feel very good about this one - cutting his bingo percentage from 21% to just 7%

#note I can simply leave this lane untouched by playing YIN at F12, but I thought I would try to make this spot harder for him to use, especially since he likely has great leftover tiles. however, I do give him a lot of good J plays to catch up on spread in the process. I think I will always win even if I bingo, but is it really right for me to not interfere with this lane?
