>Chris: ?ELNORW 8H OWL +12 12
#note The first tile I see is a blank, and I know this will be a pretty good tournament :) ... So I saw REfLOWN, but talked myself out of it, reasoning that if REFLY isn't good (it is), then this can't be either. I didn't want to open the tourney with a phony, and figured I'd bingo with ENR? next turn anyway. Not the right thought process at all obviously - I'll just have to blame first game nervousness I guess..
>Leesa: AAAAAAA -AAAAA +0 0
>Chris: ?EFNPRR H6 PR.FaNER +63 75
#note This is the only bingo available here. 1/2 lol. Held for almost 3 minutes - I was praying for a challenge since I did know this one was good 100%.
>Leesa: IJN G8 JIN +32 32
>Chris: EFGLNRU 11E FUN.ER +29 104
#note Interesting move here. I picked FUNNER over FUNNEL because I didnt want to give up the big S hook, but this board has several already (JOWLS, PROFANERS), so opening another one seems less important. The sim likes (E)NGULF 12H, but its not the type of play I like to make when ahead on a semi-closed board, since it will make it harder to close it down later. I considered ENGULFER* too for about a minute, but luckily decided against it.
>Leesa: DEGISU K3 GUIDES +31 63
#note Interesting choice between GUIDES K5 and GUISED K3, both scoring 31 (ofc I don't know what her last tile was). GUISED forks the board kind of, but GUIDES I think leads to a more dynamic board long-term since it opens the top of the board more. I like GUIDES>GUISED in a vacuum I think.
>Chris: EEEGLOS 12C GEE +13 117
#note Was set to play OGEE B12, but got scared of letting her back into the game with a cheap Y hook at A12. GEE isn't too much worse on the sim ;however it does open the A and O hooks for sevens and is worse bingo defense. There's no particular reason why she should have a Y here, so idk.
>Leesa: CDHT 4J D.TCH +22 85
#note I got kinda lucky Leesa drew seemingly all consonants and I didnt get hit with a big play on the B column here.
>Chris: EELNOST 13E ENT.ESOL +66 183
#note The only bingo available. 2/3 lol. I looked for about a minute for others since I didn't particularly like the huge spot it created.
>Leesa: IZ 6F ZI. +34 119
>Chris: AACIORV L9 CAVI. +20 203
#note I was set to play VIR(G)A C9 for 26, blocking the G and the OGEE/AGEE hooks, but then I started to worry about the huge M lane spot. I figured that  bingo there would put Leesa right back in the game and open nothing for my playback, whrereas a bingo on the left side would score less and give me some playback most likely. Therefore, I decided to block with CAVI(L) L9. I like VOI(L)A better now though, because it keeps a better leave and keeps the C to block the left side potientially next turn (also the C is good with the H at N4).
>Leesa: IKM M2 MI.K +24 143
>Chris: AADEORT N1 OAT. +24 227
#note Seems clear-cut, although if I had kept the C with VOI(L)A last turn, I could have taken a big stranglehold potentially by blocking the G.
>Leesa: EY O1 YE +35 178
>Chris: ADEQRUV B10 QUAVER +81 308
#note I think QUARE is safer and might be better here, but I got greedy.
>Leesa: DIOT 15A D.OIT +21 199
#note When she laid down the D first I was like oh no! what did I do?
>Chris: AAADEMS J6 AA. +12 320
#note Didn't really want to fish while ahead this much, but didn't see what else to really do.
>Leesa: ILNOORT -NOORT +0 199
>Chris: ADEMOPS 13A A.O +18 338
#note Considered MOPS 14I for 33 and probably should have taken it; my reasoning here is that I wanted to keep the S to pounce on any setups she made, but I don't think that's strong enough reasoning to sac spread with this large of a lead.
>Leesa: BILT F2 BLIT. +22 221
>Chris: DEMOOPS G1 MOOD +18 356
#note Paranoid blocking! Bad, should just play MOPS for 33 again.
>Leesa: AX H1 AX +51 272
#note Swift and deserved punishment haha.
>Chris: EGIOPSU 14J OPS +26 382
#note My reasoning here is that I wanted to stay over a bingo ahead and not open anything, considering there's still a blank out, but now I'm leaving myself exposed to setups and I could draw a horrible rack. (this keeps EGUI). This is a direct result of playing MOOD last turn - MOPS was actually 'safer' I think.
>Leesa: BINY 15G INBY +33 305
>Chris: AEEGHIU 11A H.E +10 392
#note I mistracked and wanted to block bingoes ending in I on the C column. Yes, really lol. H(OP)E K12 seems to be the best choice here.
>Leesa: N 12L .N +2 307
#note Here is where I'd like to have my S to pounce on the setup...
>Chris: AEGILU 10J EG.L +11 403
#note Luckily I can block it, though. She had AERRSW?, so I needed to (I had somehow fixed my tracking and I knew, lol).
>Leesa: ?AERRSW 2A SWEAt... +38 345
#note Nice find!
>Chris: AITU 3C TA +10 413
#note -1 to (E)TUI C2
>Leesa: RR 9F R.. +6 351
#note -7 to RET C1, since it blocks my out
>Chris: IU A1 I. +6 419
#note -7 to (ET)UI, lol. I think I was low on time here, but still.
>Leesa: R 12H .R +5 356
>Leesa:  (U) +2 358
#note Interesting first game; I am now something like 16-3 in first games despite making pretty bad mistakes in most of them. Other than REfLOWN, I think I played decently - she seemed to be struggling with bad draws, having to exchange twice.
