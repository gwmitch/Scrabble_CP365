>Charles_Reinke: CEGINPV H4 GIVEN +22 22
#note Thanks again to Avery for racks and commentary.
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEINOU 4H .UErIDON +70 70
#note A: This was the first blank I had seen all day. I'm glad I chose right here.
>Charles_Reinke: ACGPSXY O1 CYA. +27 49
#note C: Sims poorly, probably because of the unwieldy GPSX leave and the fact that I have no immediate prospects for the X. Thought about N3 C(O)AX, which looks good in retrospect...I passed it up because of plays to the TWS down column O. Not a good reason to pass up that play.
>Avery_Mojica: AEFFJTU 5E FUJ. +28 98
>Charles_Reinke: EEGOPSX 4D GOX +36 85
#note C: The bag bailed me out and now I get to make a high-scoring play while keeping a good leave.
>Avery_Mojica: AEFNSTT L2 FA.NTEST +62 160
#note A: I felt idiotic for staring at FATTENS for like 5 minutes and debating its validity. Now I feel more idiotic for realizing it's a word.
>Charles_Reinke: EENOPPS G7 PEPONES +77 162
#note C: Not a word. Probably confused with PEPONIDA. I put down just PEPO by itself and then saw my remaining three letters and had to take my play back to ponder whether PEPO could be pluralized this way.

A: I honestly thought this was good. I don't know why, but when he at first laid down PEPO, I thought that's what he was going to play. Weird.

>Charles_Reinke: AAABDER K7 BAAED +24 186
#note C: N2 AB(O)ARD is 36.
>Avery_Mojica: ILLNTUV H12 VILL +46 239
>Charles_Reinke: AADEKRS 3C KA +15 201
#note C: Glad to see this play since it forks the board very effectively.
>Avery_Mojica: IMNORTU J9 OMIT +28 267
#note A: I should really address the lane he made here, but most of my blocks give him free access to a triple when there wasn't really one already (besides the L at the bottom). NOTUM especially seemed like it was easier to hit if he started with a vowel. I figured he was already sitting on something with AES in it, but this might be too defensive. I did not see OUTGIVEN or FUMY, both of which I like more than this.
>Charles_Reinke: AADERRS 2L .RA. +20 221
#note C: DE(F)RA(Y) is fourteen more points. I didn't see it, but I think I'm down by enough that I need to be focused on leave here.
>Avery_Mojica: EINORUY B2 ROUEN +21 288
#note A: I don't even know how to describe this.
>Charles_Reinke: ADEHRSS A5 DASHERS +88 309
#note A: Punishment has been properly established.
>Avery_Mojica: ?IIINOY M1 I.I. +14 302
#note A: More punishment has been established.
>Charles_Reinke: ACEGIOZ 2D GAZE +39 348
#note C: Fishing for a T...
>Avery_Mojica: ?INORWY 1G WINY +35 337
#note A: I had mistracked and thought there was one R and one N left. Oops. WIRY is still better in that case I think. I'm not really performing well at all at this rate.
>Charles_Reinke: ACEEIOT O1 ....OTIC +45 393
#note C: Got it!

A: nice
>Avery_Mojica: ?ILLORR 10A .OLL +6 343
#note A: Pretty unfortunate draw right there. It had been a pretty rough drawing day, so I got pretty frustrated and slapped this down. ORFRAY up top is a pretty cool play I didn't see. I need to slow down even in these bad situations and really focus on finding better plays than this.
>Charles_Reinke: AEEIQRT 7N Q. +11 404
>Avery_Mojica: ?BEHORR 15B HORRiB.E +63 406
#note A: I'm glad I at least got this down. I didn't really expect the next play, but that's life. A good lesson to work on finding better plays even under bad racks.
>Charles_Reinke: AEEIRTT 14H .ATERITE +72 476
#note C: Wasn't expecting to bingo, but Avery's own bingo scored so little that I'd win easily even if I didn't have a bingo here.
