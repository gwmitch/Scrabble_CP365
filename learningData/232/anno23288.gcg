#note this is for those who claim i've been getting lucky. i like 5K VAIL however, more aggressive. quackle likes L3 LA. quackle is right. it's worth the sacrifice for the significantly greater bingo % (and i might be blocking a good scoring spot for him. i have bingo lanes). -6.5

#note quackle likes scoring with L2 TAU as it thinks my bingo % is virtually identical. i wanted to open up the big lane though. -6

#note this was a massive mistake. i thought that i need the blank, or something, so badly that i turned over two more tiles for it. TURNOVER IS ALWAYS WRONG, CESAR. in this case, mainly, TEGMEN is awful defensively. (also, LEGMEN). i did lay down GLEG first but then dumb took over. -10.5
