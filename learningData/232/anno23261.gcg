#note i have to not lose this game by 305 to win the tourney. i think OE is probably right anyway, and i think it might be slightly more right with that constraint.

#note i made a couple of terrible moves in a row here. i am not sure why exactly, but mostly, i still do this way too frequently. it's pretty easy for me to lose focus, and it's game 6, i think i have the tournament sealed up, and boom, let's make a horrid move. i was wondering why the hell i didn't play HERB after hitting the clock.  RAVEN 9E (ew), 15L HAVE, or INVAR 8K too maybe. or JAB. -9

#note it didn't occur to me at all that he had another bingo, so this is a massive, gigantic mistake. 8K INVAR is the play here. i also counted this as 71 somehow. -72
