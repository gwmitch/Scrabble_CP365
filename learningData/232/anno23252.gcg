#note aah, didn't know GLIDDERY# here for a bunch more points.

>JD: ABGLMNY C7 B.GYMAN +40 146
#note I struggled between CYMBAL and BOGYMAN, but I wasn't sure if CYMBALO# was good or not. this is still fine
>Olaugh: ABINQ 3K N.Q.B +32 232
>JD: AEFLNRW 10J FLAWN +39 185
#note I could keep the N trying to draw for an -ING bingo on row1, but took the 3 extra points intead.
>Olaugh: DEHIJNO 11A DE.IJOHN +92 324
>JD: ?CENORX 12E OX +27 212
#note might as well play ORYX at 10A for 5 more points (not ONYX because saving the last N for row 1 is important)

#note I could also have made this UNGRACED which is TWL-acceptable.
>Olaugh: AIP 7G PIA +23 376
>JD: AEIOTTV A11 .OVIE +30 336
#note the pool was astonishingly heavy on vowels (14 vowels, 8 consonants) so I tried to compensate with my play. nonetheless, ATT with two Ts remaining is an ugly play.
>Olaugh: ?EFIOSU 2C FOUlIES +63 439
>JD: AAIRTTU 3B TAUT +22 358
#note I bingo more keeping the last T, probably worth playing TAU (also complicating his pre-endgame).
