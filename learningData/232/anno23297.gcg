#note I was happy to play a waiting move here rather than open with WENNY. close on a sim. then again maybe I should open things up if I intend to cash in my X.

#note pool is very vowel-heavy, and NTW has better synergy anyway.

#note I had already burned a lot of time for no reason so I didn't take the time to find a play like POTAGE or APOGEE. but actually the pool has become vowel-heavy so POTAGE is worth it. but my play has the advantage of setting up potential -ING bingos with tons of Is left.

#note I wanted to preserve row 10 and row 15 bingos. but the much better way of doing that is either OE or TOE at M3.

#note mike burns the last E but also offers it up for me to use in an 8...
>JD: AAISTTT 2H .AT +8 193
#note can score more with the same fish, is it worth opening the lane? I think yes.
