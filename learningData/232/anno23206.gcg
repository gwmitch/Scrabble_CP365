#note I'm losing by a bingo and telegraphing a great rack. I can't not open a lane this turn. Ross is going to try to block.

#note Gosh I hate letting Ross have that Z, but BEZIL leaves me with just a clunky leave. Maybe I should do it anyway, though, since a Z overlap is gonna do bad things to the board. Anyway, I'm trying to set up an ING play here. Quackle suggests maybe just BE. CLING makes a lot of 7s.

#note I hated everything about this play, since it makes it so hard to keep the board open. Ross is about to block the G and FOES hook, if he can. Then I'm in real trouble.  I missed C(A)LF, which defends against the blockage a little bit and makes it easier to open later. I dunno though. I'm in a lot of trouble no matter what
