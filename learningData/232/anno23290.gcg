>Adam_Logan: IJKLPRU 8H PULIK +32 32
#note Adam checks to make sure that it's not OK to use Quackle to find moves.  I think that's his kind way of making sure that the club isn't using Quackle to find moves!
>OSC: ?AADDRS L8 .hADDARS +78 78
#note The club's first idea is DAD, but Matthew surprises the group by pointing out (K)hADDARS, which happened to come up in his cardbox half an hour before.  Yay Matthew!
>Adam_Logan: ?ADGJRW 13K J.W +26 58
#note I didn't tell Adam what the blank was, but he correctly guessed that it was an H.
>OSC: HINOQRS I7 Q.IN +24 102
#note Two turns in, and the club is already fretting about whether Adam is signaling a bingo, until Matthew reasons that Adam would have played J(A)W from a lot of racks that aren't bingo-prone, and he turns out to be right.  Wayne doesn't like the idea of playing defensively against Adam on principle, reminding us how good he is at grinding out close endgames.  Q(U)IN narrowly wins the vote over 9G QI.
>Adam_Logan: ?ADGGRV 15H RAGG. +21 79
#note Adam would have liked to dump the V also, with V(U)GG, but since that's no longer open...
>OSC: AHOOORS M9 OHO +17 119
#note Play OHO, or, as Chris suggests, exchange AOOOH and hope to draw into LAMBRE(QUIN)S?  Hm, tough choice!  (Don't tell Chris that exchanging just OOOH might be more likely to work.)
>Adam_Logan: ?CDGMUV -UDGMV +0 79
#note Adam decides to keep C?, but he says that keeping CD? or playing N7 VUG were close choices.
>OSC: AEHORSY N9 YAH +31 150
#note Lots of choices here!  The club casts four votes for N9 YAH, two for N11 HOSEY (for an extra 11 points), one for 14F YEAH and one for K10 YA.  Quackle concurs.
>Adam_Logan: ?BCETTW 11G WET +20 99
#note Adam:  "I play WET at 11G and hope for the best."  Oops.
>OSC: AEELORS 12D AREOLES +89 239
#note Wasn't that nice of Adam to give us a better spot?  At least one club member realizes this only after jumping on the previous best spot.  Hey, we've all done that in real games!
>Adam_Logan: ?BCELTT D8 CuTT.BLE +65 164
#note No hesitation from Adam on this one.
>OSC: ALNOTUY 14B UN.AY +32 271
#note The club decided on UN(L)AY before Ross, forgetting for a moment that he's not allowed to vote, mentions TO(L)UYL.  After patting himself on the back for changing a couple of minds, Ross rules himself out of order and the prior opinion stands.  :-)
>Adam_Logan: BDIOOOX 8A OXI. +39 203
#note Again, no second thoughts here.
>OSC: AEGILOT O5 LOGIA +24 295
#note Between O5 LOGIA and the more defensive O6 GLIA, the club decides to go for the longer play, anticipating the possibility of a vowel-heavy draw.
>Adam_Logan: BDFINOO 7A NOB +26 229
#note Adam laments the location of the L (do you see the eight-letter word using his rack plus L)?
>OSC: EEMMNOT 9A MO +19 314
#note Did Adam do that to set up FO-- on Row 6?  Is that more or less of a threat than the hotspot at N6?  Ultimately, Ryan broke the tie vote between N4 MEM and 9A MO.
>Adam_Logan: DEFIIOZ J6 FI. +25 254
#note Adam:  "My play is FIL at J6.  (TIZ can wait for next turn, if there's nothing better then.)"
>OSC: EEMNNTV N3 NEEM +24 338
#note Jeremy (among others) is worried about a big play like ZAI(R)ES on Row 14 and considers playing (R)EV to block that possibility, but also fears something like ZEST coming back on Column O.  (QUINTE)T also blocks this with less risk but still scores few points.  The club would like to be rid of its V before drawing the second one, but settles on NEEM.
>Adam_Logan: DEIIOTZ 4I IODIZ. +32 286
#note Considering all the good stuff unseen, Adam throws the board open as much as he can.
>OSC: EFINNTV 13G EFT +38 376
#note Huge discussion here!  EFT puts us way ahead but has no defensive value; M2 FI(Z) scores well and takes away a place where Adam could both score and open the board; I3 V(I)N scores very few points but almost guarantees that Adam won't bingo.
>Adam_Logan: ACERSTT M1 CRA.E +39 325
#note Adam got a lovely rack from his IODIZ(E) play, but his only seven is SCATTER, and it doesn't fit.  He also considers O11 SCART, but with as many vowels unseen as there are, thinks that STT is as good a leave as ET.
>OSC: EINNRSV 1K VI.ES +33 409
#note The choice here is between VI(C)ES to block the triple-triple (almost the only way to lose the game) and O11 SIVER to get the bag down to two tiles.  The club goes for the "safe" play.
>Adam_Logan: DEIRSTT L3 D.RT +13 338
#note Masterful analysis from Adam:  "OK, let's see.  I don't think I can win by playing one since they play one and I'm no better off, and I can't get a high-scoring bingo by playing just the S.  If I play DIRT at L3 I win by drawing ANV, giving ANTIVENOMS and NATIVES: 2/120 = 1/60.  If I play two, TIT looks best: I win by drawing EV and leaving P in the bag, since they can't block the top that I can see and UREA loses by 1 to DERIVES.  I always lose if they can play PIU, PIA, or VIA, or if they can play UREA unless I have DERIVES.  If they don't have any of those plays, the last three in the bag must be one of:  (1) AUU: they just block RESIDUA with VIN or whatever.  (2) AP and one more.  If they have the V, they can figure out that VIN wins.  If not, they can figure out that RUIN wins.  So it looks like that's the only way for TIT to win: 2/360.  I'm too far behind for uTE or UT to work, though UT would be great if I were losing by 40.  Also VICES looks more like keeping an E than an A or N.  DIRT it is."
>OSC: ENNPRUV I1 UNP.N +10 419
#note Much frustration trying to find an unblockable out-in-two, until Heidi points out that Adam has AU(R)EI for big points on Row 14.  After sizing up the scores, though, the club votes to play UNP(I)N and force Adam to decide between the big play and blocking our out-play.
>Adam_Logan: AEEISTU 14J AI.EST +37 375
#note Adam:  "I see two out-plays for them: VERT and ERUV.  If I play AIREST at 14J for 36, I gain 25 from this point.  If I block both, there is a little trick: if they now play REV I can stick them with the R.  But they can play ER first, with two spots for EV--unless my blocking play is SUITE, since then I would go out, but then I can't score enough after REV to make it worthwhile.  Alternatively I could play EAU for 3, keeping SUITE for O11.  However, that creates another R-spot so they can easily play REV.  So I just play AIREST, presumably losing 430-375."
>OSC: ERV 11A VER. +7 426
#note With a choice of two equal out plays, the club predictably falls into mock arguments about "verties" and the relative stylistic merit of ER(U)V.  Either way, it's a win for the club.  Congratulations, team!
>OSC:  (EU) +4 430
