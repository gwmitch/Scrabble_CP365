>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAEILU 8G LAUA +8 8
#note I can't believe I played this. It needs the N, duh! 
>Danny_Panganiban: HYZ J7 H.ZY +27 27
#note I think Danny would have challenged, but he wasn't paying attention.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEEEIN 10I E.E +6 14
#note Not gonna play (Z)EE.
>Danny_Panganiban: DEE L10 DEE +16 43
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIJNT G5 JET.INEr +66 80
>Danny_Panganiban: DEIRT H11 TIRED +25 68
>Danny_Panganiban: DEIRT --  -25 43
#note He thought the blank was an S when he played this.

>Danny_Panganiban: DEIRT F6 DE +16 59
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGIMVW 11D WAV. +20 132
#note I figured I needed to block this column. Maybe I should just take 28 for 11K F(E)W? He's probably going to play on row 13 anyways.
>Danny_Panganiban: EIOPRTT 13I POTTIER +79 138
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGIMOT -  +0 132
#note I didn't know that definition of POTTY.
>Danny_Panganiban: AEOOU O12 U.EA +15 153
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGIMOT 4K MOTIF +38 170
#note Missed 12A FAGOT, the M is a better letter to keep I think.
>Danny_Panganiban: ACENOOR E3 CORONAE +75 228
#note Damn, this game got ugly fast.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGILOR 12B GAOL +22 192
#note I looked at so many plays here. FOLIA/R and 3L RAGI scored the most points. But GAOL had a bit better of a leave. Sim says I really crapped the bed though, and (F)OLIAR should have been automatic.
>Danny_Panganiban: GMRY N2 GR.MY +38 266
#note Man, did I ever make the wrong choice.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIIRX 14J XI +52 244
>Danny_Panganiban: ABW D4 WAB +35 301
>Matthew_Larocque: ABINRTU 3L BU. +20 264
#note Apparently there's a 37 point play here, but it's one of the new words.
>Danny_Panganiban: ILNST 13A LINTS +26 327
#note See what happens when I don't play FOLIAR.
>Matthew_Larocque: AINPQRT O1 QI +36 300
>Danny_Panganiban: FILOS 15G FILOS +37 364
>Matthew_Larocque: ANNOPRT C1 PANTO +23 323
#note PON(E)NT, but I didn't know it. Plus I need some kind of fluke.
>Danny_Panganiban: ?AGNOSS 1C .ASSiNG +30 394
#note Well if that's how it's going to be.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHINRRV N9 VEIN.R +28 351

>Matthew_Larocque: HR 2B R.H +17 368
>Matthew_Larocque:  (D) +4 372
#note I lost, but I think I played slightly less bad than most of my other games. Do I win if I play FOLIAR or NUTBAR or don't challenge POTTIER? Hard to say.
