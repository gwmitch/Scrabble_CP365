#note ARVO at O6 leaves a much stronger leave, but I thought that the I3 spot was too cheap to leave open. ARVO wins the sim comfortably.

#note I can also block row 15 this turn by playing ENUF at M12, but I need to get ahead somehow, and keeping row 15 open for bingos looks like the easiest way to accomplish this. I'm only about 25% to bingo.

>JD: AAELSTW 13H AWA +27 423
#note I was hoping that playing AWA would make it tougher to bingo on row 12, but TWA looks way better - putting the A there risks a huge scoring response.
