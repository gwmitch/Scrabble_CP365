#note i may be too much of a sucker for points. something like ADIEU at 14G looks reasonable, or FAUVE F2 (which i didn't see, but still wouldn't have played).

#note damn! i totally didn't see 11B QAID - very much better than my play. i think i get too excited. i guess i was also kind of paranoid about that spot, even though i should be aggressive with the blank. I've noticed quackle tends to really hate when i do that (block a high scoring lane when i have a great rack).. which makes sense.  -8

#note BRAIZE has a cool extension, lol. L1 GHEE sims best. all my moves should have a purpose. HAO is a purposeless move. UTTER FAIL. -5.5

>cesar: EEEGINN L10 NEE +16 373
#note i laid down NEE pretty fast (i was feeling clever about the HENT "setup") and completely did not realize i almost emptied the bag. i haven't done that in forever. would have been a disastrous way to lose...
>kevin: J 9C J. +17 296
>cesar: ABDEGIN A8 BEADING. +89 462
#note i laid down BADINAGE first. I was about 90% sure on BADINAGE, and about 85% sure on BEADINGS, but BEADINGS scored more. it's a little crappy to not be 100% sure, especialy in a situation like this, where if i'm wrong i straight up lose the game. as it is, i win by a lot, but not because i'm any good. :P
