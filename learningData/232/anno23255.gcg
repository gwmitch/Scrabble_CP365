#note I missed the killer blow of RENEAGUES#+ for 74, newly added in CSW15! I guess that's what I get for not studying more.

#note I can't remember if I saw the row 7 fits, but LIFTER looks like a nice try here - the bingo is really unfriendly to bingos so my way back into the game is to try to outscore and draw some power tiles. big error.
>JM: ADH M6 .DAH +30 266
>JD: ILLMOST 4K TOLL +14 225
#note no play raises my bingo percentage as dramatically as TOLL - he will probably block on row 4 but I thought I had to open to come back. but I'm also only down 55, so perhaps I'm sacrificing too many points. I think this is worthwhile in the end.
>JM: AIP 7H PIA +31 297
>JD: DIMNSTZ O1 ZITS +48 273
#note I felt that I had to do this and then draw the blank for row 3 to win.

>JD: BDEEMNX 13E NE.MB +12 285
#note I was proud of this move - sure, the setup is obvious, but it may not be easy for him to respond without giving me a big X play on row 15.
>JM: ?ADEITU 3E DAUTIEs +65 378
#note gg?
>JD: ADEMVXY 2I MY +32 317
#note at this point I figured I could only feint on row 1, leave some confusion and then try to hit a 80+ point play on row 14 to win. even then it probably cannot be enough!
