>Ruth_Hamilton: AKPR 8G PARK +20 20
>JD: CEFHOVV H7 V.V +9 9
#note I liked the chance to jam up the board, especially if she doesn't know the PARKI hook, but the F really slows down the leave so Q prefers exchanging down to CEH.
>Ruth_Hamilton: EIIOORW -EIIOO +0 20
>JD: CEFHMNO J8 .EF +18 27
#note a sim prefers FECK at J5, but I have trouble seeing it work especially well
>Ruth_Hamilton: AJR K9 RAJ +27 47
>JD: CFHMNOT L10 NOTCH +35 62
#note I thought she might not have the courage to play NOTCHY.
>Ruth_Hamilton: AHY M11 YAH +47 94
>JD: FIIIMNU -FIIIMNU +0 62
#note FICHU should be good enough to surpass exchanging. also, keeping IMN is preferred even though there are no spots for it on the board. I think I like excahnging all 7.

#note yet again
>Ruth_Hamilton: BEERSTU -BEER +0 148
>JD: BEERSTU M5 REBUT +28 204
#note the blanks seduced me into playing long, but BERSTU is pretty powerful - Q prefers VEER at 9H. as an added bonus, any bingo I draw would be very tough to block.
