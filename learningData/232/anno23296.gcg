#note I thought about playing long here with LUTING. the sim is pretty close between a lot of plays including RUT, which I don't like very much here.

>JD: DDGINRT --  -65 0
#note yeah...bad try. should just fish.
>Doug: GNUY E7 Y.UNG +18 94
>JD: DDGINRT J4 NIDG.T +12 12
#note at this point against a strong defensive player like doug I felt that I had to stop fishing with an ungainly -ING leave.
>Doug: EISZ 4H ZI.ES +48 142
#note doug had YEZ/ZA, not sure if he saw it.

>JD: DINPQTX 3G ..X +38 367
#note I can score well with both the X and the Q. Ideally I would play more tiles to increase my chances of drawing QADI or a U, but this scores too much.

>JD: ADEGNPT K9 AGENT +26 430
#note really dunno here. I wanted to maximize my shot at the blank but not empty the bag to make doug's endgame bplanning tougher. Q likes saving the N which AGENT fails to do.
