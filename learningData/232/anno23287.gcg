#note largish error by cesar not playing EPEE and instead giving me access to the triple. cesar: i need to figure out how to not make moves like this. i saw EPEE and thought "derp i don't want to get rid of 3 Es..." ??? like how do I always think this way after 15 years playing this game in all its various incarnations? -10

#note terrible miss of DIETARY, I can only blame having been distracted by DIELYTRA#...

#note quackle likes M9 DROGUE maybe a tiny bit better.

#note ELITE isn't in top 15 static but sims just off the top thanks to great defense. I thought GEE at L12 made cesar's job too easy. I guess LIEGE looks pretty good too.
>Zar: EFJKLRU 12H JUK. +23 86
#note he blocked two giant plays! N12 FUR is super interesting.

#note JD: missing the new AUGH. cesar: AUGH!! I thought of it, and was not sure enough. I actually thought it was phony, even though I've gone over the new 4s quite a few times now. -15.5

#note JD: nice one  cesar: I wasn't sure of this - I'd say I was about 75-80% on it, but i still didn't want him to challenge. i suppose blocking the BOPS bingo lane is almost impossible though.
>JD: AACEIRT -  +0 265
#note a bad gamble to take, I'm 40% to bingo if I just play CADI at this turn, so it's basically an even game. I wanted to challenge this off and then play ACARI at M1, trying to draw a big play while he bingos on row 10. instead I make it almost impossible to come back.
