#note totally missed GLEAM. this was a hard move for me, it's hard to find plays sometimes. I did see MIGGLE but was definitely not sure of it. it's what a MIG is. :/ ...  -7.5

#note considered FYCE to block bingo lanes but that pool is hideous even with the blank. he is ~9% to bingo with FEY (granted it assumes a random rack but still) and ~7% with FYCE.

#note the best play here is 4H ON, by far. first of all, EROTICAS loses if I draw the Q. also, if i don't draw the Q, he has EQUIP for 75 a lot of the time. i need to be better at scrabble. -12.5. ON basically wins all the time.
