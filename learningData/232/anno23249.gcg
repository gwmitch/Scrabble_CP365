>Matt_Canik: ADELLRZ 8H LAZED +34 34
>Jackson_Smylie: ADENOSU 9J ANODE +24 24
#note lots to consider here - ANODE, ODA, AENEOUS, and other stuff like DUODENA but I wasn't as big on it. ANODE is less dangerous cause an S is not in his range after LAZED (zedas, zeals). Q isn't big on anode, and prefers ODA, but I like setting up the S here. I don't mind the other two options.

#note cLARKIA!
>Jackson_Smylie: EORSSTU O8 ESTROUS +81 105
>Matt_Canik: ?EILNOW 14H tOWLINE. +86 147
#note or BOWLINES? makes the Y dangerous, but makes H column plays less likely/disastrous.
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEEIRT 15H AE +11 116
#note terrible - missing the exquisite (AL)ITERA(t)E and the exquisite(ly obvious) AERIE.
>Matt_Canik: EGIJSTV 10H JIG +32 179
#note jivest/jives look good. I'd also consider jag.
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIIMRT 6B RETIME +28 144
#note somehow missing REEMIT, and that whole spot (retime for one more looks fine). yuck
>Matt_Canik: AELQSTV E5 Q. +22 201
>Jackson_Smylie: EHINRTT C1 THIRT.EN +74 218
#note lucky break
>Matt_Canik: AELLSTV 3B V.LL +7 208
#note VENAL or LEVA look good, DOVETAIL is also cool. I'm not a big fan of fishing here, AEST with the T open isn't quite as good, and there are plays that balance it more nicely and also outscore.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ADFFIO F2 FID +23 241
#note ...although he induced error/sacrifice in me. considered OFT, FOND, FIND, AVO, FID. offa/oka I did not see. my thinking was that his range after VILL is really strong, cause I know matt does not fish much at all (does not like volatility). I didn't consider this at the time, but consonant heavy leaves like NRST are out of his range cause he wouldn't play qi keeping 6 consos. I expected something like enst or erst, not as likely vowel heavier cause he would have something at 1a or 8a worth playing. this may be an overreaction to his range, but at the same time, AFO? leaves 10M OF(T) that could outrun his bingoes, especially with blank in hand. a play like FOND or FIND is riskier cause of S- bingoes and bingoes through the F or T which score a lot more than what does after FID.
>Matt_Canik: AEEINST D8 ETESIAN +69 277
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ACFHOO 10L COF. +39 280
#note coft? hoof? hoof goes for a different goal of bingoing, but I'm not a big fan of that plan on this board - COFT goes for 1a plays keeping the H which I like for outscoring. 
>Matt_Canik: ABDGMRY 14A BRA.DY +40 317
#note I like mangy a bit better I think, but I"m not sure. 4 tile plays underneath are very scary there, but that's not very likely, and 3 tile plays are usually not too devastating.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ABHNOO A12 HO.O +39 319
#note I wasn't sure of BOBO - I liked keeping the H for A1. but HOBO isn't much worse so I wanted safety.
>Matt_Canik: GGMOOPX 5G POGO +12 329
#note seems like a huge sacrifice - I may not spot the setup, but it still allows me to score well. OXIM gives stuff back if I have an I, but PAX is also okay, and MOGGY.I like MOGGY cause XI/XU with an I or U draw is 31, and the X has other opportunities here.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ABNNTV 4H BAN +20 339
#note not sure what to do here - I know ban is terrible though. SX is his main range, but BAN does not address the pogos hook, and especially does badly against a rack containing XS (and likely I). I considered BANNs, which i like better now, also NAV above and below. I am likeing N(O)B some now... making NO leaves the NOW/NOM hooks which aren't desirable. NAV below maybe? NOB? I am undecided.
