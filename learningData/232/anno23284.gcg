#note this is unfortunately a major screwup. i didn't foresee the possibility that he would fish with FADGE, and the way to block it is to play J1 OH (keeping JOWLY for 52 next turn!!). i didn't want to play JOWLY right away because i felt like i would need the points later just in case. I did see HOYA J2 and that sims second best; it makes FADGE unlikely because he would then empty the bag and I would know his rack. (but I didn't think of that either, unfortunately). This was a poor move and I was pretty low on time at this point too. -9 win%

#note i absolutely ran out of time here and could not figure out how to block ASSHOLE in two spots. this was a random move. maybe i should have taken the extra minute. (Jerry also saw ENHALOS which would lose to PIAL). I need a vertical move at C or A that can't be overlapped with any bingo and doesn't take an S. can't find one. GG.
