>Jason_Li: GUV 8G GUV +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEEIJN G3 JEEIN. +23 23
#note Didn't think an O was really in most of his range. Otherwise this would be a tougher decision between this, JI(V)E and JI(V)ED. I considered JE(U) too to make it interesting, but I guess I wasn't that quirky.
>Jason_Li: DEHORTT H1 TROTH +44 58
#note Drew an O :(
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEEEEN F6 BE +22 45
>Jason_Li: DEGINTU 1E DUE.TING +62 120
#note Jason wasn't sure enough of DUETING+.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEENOQ -EEOQ +0 45
#note The Q is horrible at this stage, I had to get rid of it. Not even 20 points for 2H plays were worth it.
>Jason_Li: ILRTW E7 TWIRL +19 139
>Joshua_Sokol: DEENNOR 8A RENE. +27 72
#note Really bad to chicken out of the word ENDO(W). What was I thinking?! Me and Jason have now made similar sized-mistakes.
>Jason_Li: CEFFO B3 COFFE. +22 161
#note Hi Reuvena Ross!
>Joshua_Sokol: DINOOOS 5B .OOD +16 88
#note When this is your best play, you must have done something wrong...
>Jason_Li: AIX J1 .XIA +27 188
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINOPS A8 .IPIENOS +83 171
>Jason_Li: ?CGIIOS 11E .OGIStIC +70 258
#note 12A (E)GOIStIC is a very slick fit for 85. One must remember that LOGICIST* is no good, since LOGICISM* is no good. I have gotten away with LOGICISM* against Michael Fagen I believe.
>Joshua_Sokol: ALOSUYZ L1 .AUZY +36 207
#note LOGISTIC has made my S very important to keep. Jason can all but get rid of most lanes in a few moves, while LOGISTICS is going to take a lot of creativity or luk to block. This, and the insane amount of A's left in the pool, meant that I forwent 5J SOYUZ.
>Jason_Li: ILLM K5 MILL +26 284
#note Crazy that he didn't have an A yet. Things will get interesting if I can help it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABKLOSS H10 K.BLAS +45 252
>Jason_Li: DEOV 8K .OVED +30 314
#note Evidently Jason still hasn't drawn an A since IXIA!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEOQRS 6J Q. +31 283
#note This wasn't great for me. I thought I had to avoid drawing an A when I knew it was by far the most likely thing for me to draw. Although I would have DEODARAS, which I would have seen, but just didn't see when looking at Q(I).
>Jason_Li: ANRY L11 .ARNY +28 342
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEORSU 15L .AUD +24 307
#note Damn, he blocks ROULADES and I am back to square one. I need to draw the blank here, or get very lucky. Well, all the same really...
>Jason_Li: AP M3 PA +27 369
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHMORS 2E AH +29 336
#note Here is the breaking point! I didn't write down AEHLMORS!!! What a horrible miss of ARMHO(L)ES, which gives me at least a 50% shot. I played this pre-endgame far too fast...
>Jason_Li: AAENRTT O3 RANTE. +8 377
#note And to make matters worse for the two best players in the city, Jason responds by missing ANT(E)ATER, which appears to be a sure win.

But wait!!!!! The pool is WORMSEE?, which means that I have the word WORMSEE(D). Regardless of my 7 tiles, Jason is giving me more points for my out-bingo by playing ANT(E)ATER, and guess what? If I see WORMSEED Jason cannot win. Playing the bingo here is actually, shockingly, wrong!

If and only if the M is the last letter in the bag, we will end up tying!

But amazingly, a top expert, Jason Li, misses a top 2000-probability 8 that he would have surely played instantly, and ends up making a better play altogether.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EMORSW C8 .EWSROoM +76 412
#note What a spectacle this board game can be.
