#note weird-looking move but it rocks a sim! I also considered ZEL but the L really strengthens the leave
>Dave_Wiegand: ?AENRSU 11F UN.RASEd +82 123
>JD: EGILNSU 10E UG +14 74
#note I felt compelled to open up the board with this play, but I do break up the SINGLE leave that is powerful. Two alternatives are GIN at 12J which scores well and sets up an S hook, and fishing with UM at K7. against a human opponent of dave's caliber neither GIN nor UM thrills me but perhaps UG is too easily shut down also.

#note best play is the neat EIGNE# at 15D, which performs well given a tile pool with only 5 vowels left.
>Dave_Wiegand: ?DERSTT 15D STaRTED +79 409
>JD: BEHIINV 1H .HIV +12 363
#note Q thinks I missed an opportunity to fish and keep EINV instead of BEIN, upping my bingo percentage from 2% to 4%. My chances of winning without a bingo seem very low, so BISH/HI looks like the try
>Dave_Wiegand: ACEHMUW D8 CWM +19 428
>JD: BDEINOP 13K PEND +26 389
#note dave cedes potential bingos on row 14 because the pool was ugly - from my perspective I had a shot at HIPBONE or PINBONE on row 14, only one tile off. Still, Dave didn't think he had much to gain b y not emptying the bag.
>Dave_Wiegand: AEHNNU 14F HAUN +33 461
#note I butchered this endgame - I should block HAUN first with BO and then save PINED/GAWD at 4A, which Dave cannot effectively block.
