#note surprisingly, AGIO at F8 sims even. perhaps after AGO ruth is too likely to block column L where my bingos score best?

#note minimizes disaster potential by limiting my exposure to the Q. I could also play the Z this turn but I was happy to save TZARS/REHS as a minimum.

>JD: ?AFLRTZ 10K F.Z +15 330
#note there are several moves I definitely cannot make here - ZARF at 13A risks a response of ADZED, and playing ZARFS on row 15 risks getting me V-stuck. This move also loses some endgames because Ruth has some out-in-twos that can beat me after FIZ - if I draw DV, she plays JEE at 3A leaving DACE at C12, and similarly if I draw DD she can start with JEE and save CAVE (33/36 win chance). However, both sequences require her to spot CENSURER, which is not the easiest thing to spot. The most accurate play is to fish the F again and prevent an out-in-two, but I was greedy for extra spread, and ALRTZ? won't bingo.
