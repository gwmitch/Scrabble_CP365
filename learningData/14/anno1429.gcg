#note I just did a half-assed search to see if any MLB player I have heard of had hit a home run off of the first pitch thrown in a game.  It turns out there have been 21 players that got their first career home run on the first pitch of their first at-bat.  The first person to do it was Walter Mueller, who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The more you know.
>Steve_Bush: AX 9F AX +35 35
>George_Viebranz: INNORTU J7 N.UTRINO +62 138
#note The only play.
>Steve_Bush: ADEEERS 15J SEARED +33 68
#note He must have been disheartened to miss this one.  
>George_Viebranz: ADJLOPT 10B JALOP +47 185
#note The closest I've ever come to playing a perfect tournament.  Best.
>Steve_Bush: AEEV K4 EAVE +16 84
#note The same word scores 8 more if played at 11E.
>George_Viebranz: ADEFOST 11E FAD +30 215
#note FADO is better here, but I held on to the O for maximum hookability. 
>Steve_Bush: EMU 13J .EUM +12 96
>George_Viebranz: EGIOSTU B10 .UTES +24 239
#note I don't know TOGUES, which scores 35 at H10.  I don't like either of the GOUTs, L1 or 12B.  My play doesn't make the list.  
>Steve_Bush: ACHY L2 ACHY +39 135
#note I couldn't remember if there were any front hooks to ACHY.  
>George_Viebranz: EEGGIOZ 2J ZO. +32 271
#note Quackle likes G(E)EZ 13A.  I didn't see it.  It scores 4 fewer.  I can't say the leave is better, but it is less shitty.  I wasn't really trying to be defensive, but I still like this play best. 
>Steve_Bush: MO 12L MO +20 155
#note Of those players that hit home runs in their first MLB at-bat, none of them were MO Vaughn.  And MO Cheeks played a different sport.  
>George_Viebranz: EEGGINO A13 NEG +16 287
#note George: Hey Quackle, do you like this play?  Quackle: NEG.  Not even on the list.  I didn't know GEE was a verb, and GEEING scores 35 in that juicy spot I set up a while back and didn't use.
>Steve_Bush: DO 12B .OD +8 163
>George_Viebranz: EGGIIOR -GGIIO +0 287
#note If I had known that GEORGIC was a word, it probably would have been one of my dream plays.  But I didn't learn it until later that night in Anagrams.  Brendan Sullivan is an Anagrams beast, by the way.  
>Steve_Bush: AQT 7C QAT +28 191
#note Scores 37 at N10.
>George_Viebranz: ?AEIRTY C9 Y. +9 296
#note Missed a few here.  I didn't know ApYRETI(C), but I missed YT(T)ERbIA (Sorry, Brett) and Al(T)ERITY, both at 10H.  
>Steve_Bush: HIKRS H11 SHIRK +56 247
#note I almost forgot this guy was still trying to win.  
>George_Viebranz: ?AEIRTW O8 WAITERe. +86 382
#note I kinda felt bad for Steve after this one.  One of the most spirit-crushing sequences for a Scrabbler.  
>Steve_Bush: EF G7 F..E. +34 281
#note Hold, please.
>Steve_Bush: EF --  -34 247
#note Can't blame a guy for trying.
>George_Viebranz: IINPRRT N10 PI +22 404
#note Didn't think to put down the T for 9 mote, er, more points.
>Steve_Bush: FL 5I FL.. +10 257
>George_Viebranz: IIINRRT 4F INTI +10 414
#note Sorry, Steve...
>Steve_Bush: BEL H1 BEL. +18 275
>George_Viebranz: GIIORRT N5 GIRO +12 426
#note Best, somehow.  Shuts down the only lane, leaves one in the bag, and makes me hungry for Greek food.
>Steve_Bush: ADGO 5C GOAD +15 290
>George_Viebranz: EIRTUVW 3B WIVER +26 452
#note Best.  
>Steve_Bush: ENOS 6F EONS +19 309
#note Cute out.
>Steve_Bush:  (UT) +4 313
