#note It really would have been the perfect game if I had found AUREO(L)AS which i've studdied for months.  :( Bye bye 46 points.  It just really didn't look like a bingo rack at all.  I only want to remember the game up to this point, where i scored 300 points making expert moves the whole time.

#note I've never been so heartbroken by an opponents move in my life (except maybe when someone played CRAWFISH on me for 257 points) - because I had AEIORST on my rack for a 98 point (J)AROSITE which i could barely wait to play.  It's all down hill from here...
