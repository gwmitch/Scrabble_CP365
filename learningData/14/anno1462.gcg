>George_Viebranz: AESSTTT 8D ATTESTS +66 66
#note I was debating between TAT or STAT when I thought there might actually be a bingo in this clusterfuck of decent tiles.
>Jeff_Clark: FIRU E4 FRUI. +16 16
>George_Viebranz: AEEMNOV 5B OVE.MEAN +63 129
#note Plausible, I thought, considering OVERNICE.  Jeff did not agree.
>George_Viebranz: AEEMNOV --  -63 66
#note That's what I get for being ballsy.
>Jeff_Clark: DPR D7 P.RD +11 27
#note Luckily, he doesn't capitalize too much on my lost turn.
>George_Viebranz: AEEMNOV D1 VANE +32 98
#note MOVE in the same spot is 2 more points and leaves me with all singles.
>Jeff_Clark: LNP 2B PL.N +12 39
>George_Viebranz: BDEHIMO F6 ME.HOD +35 133
#note Best.  Thought about just METH for a second too, but I just said no.
>Jeff_Clark: EEJRS 12B JEERS +37 76
>George_Viebranz: BDEIITY B12 .IB +24 157
#note Dumb.  It's Quackle's second favorite, but it's a big gamble.  Quackle says put the E down too, but I think that's even dumber.  
>Jeff_Clark: ELRY 15A RELY +46 122
#note That's why.
>George_Viebranz: DEGIITY 11E E.GY +22 179
#note LEDGY C2 would have been nice, but I wasn't even looking there.
>Jeff_Clark: ACOX J4 COXA. +30 152
#note Hold, please.
>Jeff_Clark: ACOX --  -30 122
#note 3 for 4 on trips to the laptop so far this tourney.
>George_Viebranz: ADIIKNT 13A K.D +22 201
#note Completely missed ANTI(S)KID here.  Also missed the K hook on PLAN at F2.  KIT or IKAT go nicely there.  When I clicked 'enter move' on my play, a boxing glove came out of my screen and punched me right in the neck.  Still, I didn't want to give him a big X play.
>Jeff_Clark: ACLOX 1D .OCAL +32 154
>George_Viebranz: AIINNTT 2G TIN +7 208
#note Jeff: "Uh oh, this doesn't look good."
>Jeff_Clark: DEGO C2 .ODGE +25 179
#note The spot I should have seen before.  Did I mention that Jeff is much better than I am?
>George_Viebranz: AGINOTU 12H AUTOING +74 282
#note The wisest of my choices, I believe. 
>Jeff_Clark: IQX J6 QI. +32 211
>George_Viebranz: ANOORWW N10 WA.ON +34 316
#note In case you're wondering, I forgot he had the X.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEESTX 15H rETAXES +123 334
#note And there it is.  OOF.  This came less than a minute after a triple-triple was played by Ken Dutch at the neighboring board.  Ken's play scored less than this one.
>George_Viebranz: ABORRVW O8 BROW +37 353
>Jeff_Clark: AMU B5 AMU +24 358
>George_Viebranz: ?AEINRV 10B VI. +15 368
#note Wasted a lot of time here.  Tried to find something simple first, then something fancy in the A column.  I only missed one that I should have seen, RAVElIN K1.  VERvAIN also plays in the same spot, but I don't know that one.
>Jeff_Clark: IZ J10 ZI. +32 390
>George_Viebranz: ?AEINOR 3I ANEROId +67 435
#note This also plays at K1 for 7 more points.  AE(Q)uORIN 6H is worth one more and is much more defensive.  
>Jeff_Clark: ACEILOU 14K LOA. +17 407
#note This was awesome.  Jeff lays down CA(R)IOLE L1 and picks it back up.  he played super fast through the whole game, so he spent about 8 minutes going through all the possibilities of his play and my out.  He reduces my out from 28 to 9 if he blocks F(O)H K11.  
>George_Viebranz: FH M2 F.H +9 444
#note My first victory over Clark in over a year.  How sweet it is.  
>George_Viebranz:  (CEIU) +12 456
