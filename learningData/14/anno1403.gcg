>Dallas: AAAAEIT -AAAI +0 98
>Midge_Skwire: EINZ J8 .ZINE +35 72
>Dallas: AEGLORT L4 GO +9 107
#note I was really hoping she would give me a place for LEGATOR, but oh, well.  I cleaned up as best I could.
>Midge_Skwire: OY 7M YO +18 90
>Dallas: AAELLRT H1 TALLER +27 134
#note And, if you're going to clean up your racks with an exchange, at least have the decency to see the bingos you draw. (P)ATELLAR would have been particularly cool.
>Midge_Skwire: AAIINRX -AAIIN +0 90
>Dallas: ?AEINWX O7 WAX +48 182
#note Quackle likes this best - better than WAXEN.
>Midge_Skwire: AEILOSV 1C VIOLA.ES +62 152
>Dallas: ?BEINTU 3B UNITaB.E +76 258

>Dallas: EJNNRST N6 J. +25 283

>Dallas: EENNRST D3 .NTENSER +68 351
#note TENNERS or RENNETS score more, but I got a challenge for this.  Of course, I wasn't 100% on it, and I knew TENNERS cold, so I should've played that.

#note Should've played KAF(S) in the same place.
>Midge_Skwire: ADQ B2 Q.AD +28 229
>Dallas: CHKMOUU 1M .UM +15 387
#note There were better clean up plays, like HUM(I)C, but I didn't know them.
>Midge_Skwire: EHI A4 HIE +22 251
>Dallas: CGHKORU A8 .ROCK +19 406
#note I've seen ROUGH(NE)CK before, and I've not played many nines, so this would've been a cool find.
>Midge_Skwire: ADEIORS H8 .ARODIES +89 340
>Dallas: ?DGHOPU 15D HOlD. +12 418
#note So what's the opposite of bingo-bango?  Misso-masso?  I missed PlOUGH(E)D here.
