>Bobbi_Wray: BNOR 8H BORN +12 12
#note Didn't give me the i I was hoping for. This would have been a fun game to have gone first with my rack.
>Steve: EKLRTUZ J6 ZE.K +37 37
#note Second best to Z(O)UK, which I never saw. New words still not set in stone. Even if I did see it, would have had a hard time sacrificing 9 points for the better leave.
>Bobbi_Wray: EIRTT H8 .ITTER +9 21
#note My eyes perk up at the -LY possibility.
>Steve: EGLMRTU 11E GUT.LER +32 69
#note Learned this one from Epstein, who opened a recent tournament game against me with it.
>Bobbi_Wray: ?ABEFP 13G P.EFABs +34 55
>Steve: HHIMSTU G9 HU. +21 90
>Bobbi_Wray: AIRY 12L AIRY +31 86
#note I'm again licking my chops at the 3x3 opening, now that I've picked up a blank.
>Steve: ?HIMMST F10 H.M +30 120
#note Third best behind SHIMM(Y), and then SMITH(Y).
>Bobbi_Wray: AJN 7I J.AN +38 124
#note She's sticking around.
>Steve: ?IILMST M2 eLITISM +81 201

>Bobbi_Wray: DETY 4K DE.TY +26 150
#note So much for the chance at (BITTER)LY.
>Steve: EGIOUVV 3G VOGUE +18 249
#note It was either this, or VIVE. I chose this since they were giving out a dozen fresh farm eggs as a prize for the highest V play this round.

#note Holding on to the V in hopes for the eggs, and setting up the O column.
>Bobbi_Wray: DEN G3 .END +10 246
>Steve: AEILSSV 7A VALISES +72 409
#note Voila! Egg city.
>Bobbi_Wray: ALOR A7 .ALOR +24 270
>Steve: CCDEEIR C3 CIRC.ED +28 437
#note Guarantees an out next turn, and doesn't give away the comeback points that DEICER does. Q agrees with that much, but prefers the C dump at F9 above all. Didn't see it.
>Bobbi_Wray: FGNOOTU E3 GOOF. +18 288
>Steve: EU 9C .UE +4 441
#note There's a play that scores an extra point. Did you find it?
