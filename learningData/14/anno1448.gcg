#note My choice was L1 UNDYED, but not after his last play! I have the right idea with DEY, but YOU or YOD have better leaves.

>Brendan_Sullivan: DKNNOTU 2B UNDO.K +26 152
#note I wanted to play L1 UNKNOT or 3A KNOUTED but I was playing scared. I had this idea that Pete was holding a blank, but he would have bingoed last turn...

>Brendan_Sullivan: BEILNNT L3 BLEN +17 219
#note Not sure what I was thinking of here. BLENT? BLENDE? Luckily got away with it. L10 BINT is the best play, and it even avoids opening a spot for his 7s.

#note Didn't see 13C NAIVELy. Even if I did, I might take LEAVING anyway, since he's more likely to bingo on column O.

#note I mistracked and saw an A out there, making HANDERS/HANGERS possible on row 14. Even still, I should save the E.
>Pete_Z: DEHNNRS 15A ......RS +32 327
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?GIIV G12 VI.. +8 462
#note Again, I saw an A on his rack (ADHIN somehow?) so I thought 13D DAH was coming. Luckily, this is the best play given his correct rack, too!
>Pete_Z: DEHNN K13 HEN +15 342
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?GI 2B ......InG +20 482
#note Somewhat sloppy play from me, backed by some easy bingoes and an unchallenged phoney. The extra turn from TORTILES* helped, too.
