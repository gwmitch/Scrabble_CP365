>Jason: ?DEFIRT 8F dRIFTED +74 74
#note Didn't look hard enough for the bingoes that would double the F: FlIRTED, FRItTED and FRuITED. "Good start for you," Steve said.
>Steve_Hartsman: BEEP 7H BEEP +25 25
>Jason: ?GHQSTY K5 HY.. +24 98
#note Equity-wise, exchanges are better. Q puts HY(PE)S just ahead of this. I can't explain it.
>Steve_Hartsman: IIM F6 MI.I +11 36
#note Already visibly frustrated.
>Jason: ?GQSSTT 7E Q. +11 109
#note Q likes QaTS at E9, which could be good for psychological value if nothing else.
>Steve_Hartsman: IITZ L2 ZITI +31 67
#note "And I better not see another I," Steve says while in the bag.
>Jason: ?GOSSTT M3 SOT +18 127
#note Missed eGOT(I)STS. Not an atrocious miss, considering the score/leave/defense of this, but not good.
>Steve_Hartsman: AGNOR E9 ORANG +14 81

#note So, after the bingo I drew the blank, a vowel and 12 consonants. I mean, I can't complain, as I'm keeping all the good stuff from him, but I thought I could take control early and just bag him. Not gonna happen, it looks like. "No vowels?" Steve comments. P.S. G(A)LLaNTS and G(A)LLNuTS hit the double.
>Steve_Hartsman: GOX A13 GOX +44 155
#note Almost as much as the bingo. Yeah, I'm in for the long haul here.
>Jason: ADENOUW 9K DOW +28 237
#note Considered (I)NDOW for 30, but with the unseen pool (25 vowels, 24 consonants ... I hoped always knowing the ratio could work to my advantage here) leaving AEU would be equivalent to dropping my drawers and bending over. This took longer to find than it should've. ADOWN in the same spot is better. Must. Learn. Fours. To. Make. Fives.
>Steve_Hartsman: ADEORTU C4 READOUT. +62 217
#note Yeah, definitely ain't running and hiding.
>Jason: ACEEINU 4A CU.IAE +22 259
#note Hey, I made the best play! He held, too, releasing me just as I was about to courtesy draw. Really hoped he would challenge so I could take control back.
>Steve_Hartsman: EF 2J FE. +23 240
#note In hindsight, I overestimated his leave here.
>Jason: BEENNPR 1H BREN +25 284
#note Q likes a bunch of multiple overlap plays down column B (like the five-overlap BENNE and PENNE at B6) here. 
>Steve_Hartsman: AEILU A3 A.ULEI +24 264
#note How can he hold on CURIAE and play ACULEI?
>Jason: AELNNPS H10 P.NEAL +24 308
#note I thought this was my "losing play," especially given what ensues. I had visions of Mallick whacking me for 54 after playing PINEAL in our game, I could picture RPD going "What were your GOOD tiles?", I knew opening was dangerous here. Steve knows more bingos and the pool's got a lot of single one-pointers. I'm looking at a 23-tile pool with three A's, E's and O's leaving NS. I figure the odds are good of me bingoing again this game, and if I do that, it's over almost no matter what Steve does. I was pleased Q agreed with the play; made me feel a little better.
>Steve_Hartsman: HO 13C HO. +26 290
>Jason: AIINSTV 2F VIA +18 326
#note The first two I look at are IT, for NITS, and I go "An E one time for me, baby! ONE TIME!"  No. Unbelievably, I've made the best play twice in a row.
>Steve_Hartsman: ACEKORW 15H .ACEWORK +113 403
#note I hold, figure out AENOSU's in the bag, quickly confirm I have no win by letting it go, and challenge. I mean, it's one thing if he'd played immediately, but he hemmed and hawed and sighed and coughed for about five minutes. "I had to try it," he said as I neutralize the clock. No doubt. 
>Jason: DEIJNST -  +0 326
#note The challenge computer may as well have reached out and ripped my beating heart from my chest. Steve gasped ("It was an educated guess. Obviously I haven't studied that far down in probability," he said after the game), I checked the "acceptable" box with a little too much anger, walked back to the table and seethed. One of the frustrating things is that I pulled three from a bag of ADEEJNOSU. Almost any three-tile pick ducking the J gives me a bingo at N6 or N7, maybe something through the E in PINEAL. If I have it, I bingo out and win. How do I miss drawing into NITS from that pool? *sigh*
>Steve_Hartsman: AENOSU 14L ONE +17 420
#note Missing A(E)NEOUS and not J-sticking me is a 44-point mistake. Of course, you can't blame him for mailing in the endgame at this point.
>Jason: DEIJNST N6 JINS +35 361
#note Best.
>Steve_Hartsman: ASU K11 SAU +24 444
>Steve_Hartsman: ASU --  -24 420
#note Greedy bastard. :) Missing his best out play, (A(N)US at I10), is a 47-point mistake, so that's 91 points of endgame errors. Jeez, I thought mine sucked.
>Jason: DET 3E TED +19 380
#note Lipe and Robinsky, playing each other, gave me words of encouragement before the game. I figure this is as good a spot as any to let out my frustration/let them know I suck, so as I walk past, I throw my pen down (although they probably didn't notice, as they have probably have that "focus" thing I've been hearing so much about). It bounces off a chair leg (making noise), goes in the air (higher than I thought it would) and comes to rest at the feet of (I believe) Keith Smith, still playing in what must be a time-issue endgame, since almost everybody else is done. Needless to say, he notices. Suitably embarrassed, I pick it up, go outside, try to walk it off, and contemplate a break from this stupid game and not going to Michigan Madness.
>Jason:  (ASU) +6 386
