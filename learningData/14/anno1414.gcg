>Jason: AAEILOX 9G AXE +30 30
#note Like I've said, I saw that I was 4/5 of the way to (FORM)ALIZE. That makes (M)OXA an even more embarrassing whiff. This was a half-hearted attempt at defense. Didn't want to give him a play down column K with plays like (M)AXI. 
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ADDLNP 7H PA +21 39
>Jason: AILOQTZ 10E QAT +20 50
#note Considered passing OQT, but thought I'd take the points. Baits him away from FORMALIZE, plus gives me opportunities like ZORIL for 50-some if he doesn't have the I. Q likes the cute (FA)IL at G8, a Thevenot-esque play which keeps most of FORMALIZE intact and sets up a big Q play.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ADDJLN -DDJL +0 39
>Jason: IIIILOZ -IIIO +0 50
#note I (heart) III draws. Maybe things would've been different if I'd played OIL and not made FORMALIZE my singular focus. But Q and I are thinking alike, as it ranks my play third best despite giving up 17 points of equity. Thinking back to the Cahnmann game, after Rob's exchange, I say "call" and put down four tiles. Then I thought: "Wait, is Rob a poker player?" Then I thought: "You know, Rob had a tough last game and probably doesn't appreciate your lame attempts at being clever." Then I thought: "His clock's been running for about five seconds and you STILL haven't said 'pass four'!" Yeah, my Scrabble idiocy isn't limited to my plays.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ADMNSU 11F MeDUSAN +78 117
>Jason: EEILVYZ L10 E.VY +20 70
#note Knew I was throwing away equity by not playing VEI(N)Y, but Q rates this best.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AABHLO H11 .OBLA +27 144
>Jason: EEILOUZ 14D OUZE. +34 104
#note When I clicked on "generate choices" and saw (FORM)ULIZE at the top, all I could do was throw my head back and mock laugh. Dammit, Rob, why the heck couldn't you have opened with FROM and saved me from myself?! Then I tried to rationalize my early plays in the post mortem, got too animated, ignored Rob's subtle "tone it down" gesture and bothered Berofsky and Lipe playing next to us. (I'll work on that "class" thing eventually.)
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AFHIIY D12 AH.Y +28 172
>Jason: EEIILRT J10 I.LE +6 110
#note Way too fishy at a bad time for it.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?AEFIIR K2 FAIRIEs +77 249
>Jason: EINRTTT 15A TIN. +21 131
>Rob_Robinsky: EGIOPTU C11 UPO +24 273
>Jason: CEIORTT 3I CO.TI +20 151
#note Why don't I know COTTIER? Even if it goes down, I'm in deep soup, but still!
>Rob_Robinsky: EGGHITT M6 TIGHT +16 289
>Jason: AEIORRT 8M .AR +12 163
#note With one A and two O's unseen, I wish I could explain why I didn't, at a minimum, play GOR. I'm already wondering WTH I threw a C in an open quadrant. Since I don't want to write more about how bad this play sucked, I will say it was about this time Lipe played EVZONE on Berofsky, drawing chuckles from the table.
>Rob_Robinsky: DEEGINV 4M DEV +14 303
>Jason: EIIORTU O1 OUT.IE +27 190
#note Hey, I made the best play!
>Rob_Robinsky: DEGILNS 12C ..L +5 308
>Jason: ADIKNNR B9 KIN +11 201
#note Setting up a big play for my case A. Just trying to get in the neighborhood of 300 at this point.
>Rob_Robinsky: DEGINOS 15H .GONISED +83 391
>Jason: ABDNORS 8A BARD +35 236
#note Why was I so stunned to see DARB for three more points? DARB? (One day, I'll have my fours down cold. I swear.)
>Rob_Robinsky: EEEGRWW 14N WE +23 414
>Jason: ENNORSS 13B N.. +6 242
#note I'm fishing for the C for CENSORS/SCORNE(R)S. Then I hit it! Then I see: "Oh wait, he can block both." I so suck. Q still likes the play, though.
>Rob_Robinsky: EEGJLRW D4 JEWE. +32 446
>Jason: CENORSS E2 CRONES +36 278
#note Best.
>Rob_Robinsky: GLR 6J G.L. +9 455
>Jason: S M6 .....S +20 298
#note Wasn't 100% sure of MEDUSANS, but I had to try for 300!
>Jason:  (R) +2 300
