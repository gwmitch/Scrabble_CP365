>Paul_Epstein: GIINOTT 8F TOITING +70 70
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEGIRSZ K6 ZI.GED +34 34
#note Just ZIT for 32 sims best, but I was afraid of being consonant heavy early. ZIG for 13 sims surprisingly well.
>Paul_Epstein: BELNSUU G3 NEBUL.US +63 133
#note Also UNSUBTLE for 2 points more.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADNNPRS 4C PANN.D +22 56
#note Didn't see L4 PRANG for 29. It's close between those two and J10 PAN.

#note Ugh, L10 HAE is so much better. I wasn't thinking straight.
>Paul_Epstein: CIKW 13G WICK +31 325
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AAEHOS L10 HAO +25 186
#note I didn't think to play the S for H11 OHIAS 36, but it does really open things up for me.
>Paul_Epstein: EPRX M3 PREX +49 374
#note Ouch.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AENOSW H12 W.NO +33 219

>Paul_Epstein: AGSUY 14J YUGAS +57 431
#note Ouch again.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?AACEOS N7 rOSACEA. +61 280
#note A6 OATCAKES is 3 more and SEACOAST plays at 10A and N8.
>Paul_Epstein: DEILLT O3 LILTED +34 465
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAENRTV H1 RAN. +18 298
#note Yes, VEND is 27 points there. I saw it. But RAND gave me an outside shot at drawing RELATIVE or ROTATIVE whereas VEND leaves AART and concedes the big loss without a doubt. 12F VAW is an interesting alternative. It might lead to more bingos but it leaves one less lane to work with.
>Paul_Epstein: ?BILOTV 13M B. +16 481
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEITTV 10B EVITE. +13 311
#note Hooray, I played an endgame correctly!
>Paul_Epstein: ?HLMOOV 15C MOLOt.V +12 493
#note A phoney, but it was only 12! He had 12O HM for so much more.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AT C3 A.T +16 327
#note A veritable drubbing by Paul. His post-game comment was something like, "Well, I bagged ya there."
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (H) +8 335
