#note Deer In The Headlights moment: so quick to dump the Q that i dont LOOK AT THE BOARD and see JAY for 53, or QAID for 34. ugh.

#note so annoyed that Ed blocked my 50+ pt. JOYED that i didn't look for the cool 60-pt. play. can you find it?

#note fuckup #1: PESTLIKE is no good. fuckup #2: not knowing PROTEID takes an E backhook. how exactly did i get to 1600 anyway?

#note and now commences the strange portion of our program ...
>xp: EHHOPRS K10 HOP +29 217
#note Quackle like POH or OH, using that J. i thought about both, but i figured POH would give him a free out to a triple, since he just dumped so many vowels.
>ed: AAEOOTU -AAOOU +0 246
#note Ed had 6 vowels when he played ELUATE. he has 6 vowels again. yeech.

#note i dont know what Ed's rack was exactly, but he did say he had 2 U's, which he traded and drew another U

>ed: GNTTUXZ B6 .UT +10 288
#note i have no idea what i would have done in this spot
>xp: AEEIOOU 8A E.UI +15 362
#note after his trade, i figure he's got either the X or the Z. i didnt know at the time he had BOTH of them. so as much i thought about trading here, it made more sense to play. i mean, look at this board. where the hell is he going to play that stuff if i have all the vowels?
>ed: GNTXZ C3 Z. +22 310
>xp: AAEGIOO 8L AGIO +23 385
#note i cant see how he can possibly bingo, so i take the points here and keep some vowels for a possible comeback if he plays the X somewhere open. at this point i'm thinking about spread, since i have to win by like 40 or something to finish 3rd.
