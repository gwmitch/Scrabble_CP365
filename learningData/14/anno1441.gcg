>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEINOS G8 NAOI +9 15
#note Exch AAO or Exch AO are better.
>Steve_Bush: ?ALNOPR 11B PeLOR.AN +68 82
#note I knew PELORIA(S) and PELORIC. I figured one adjectival form was enough. This one just didn't look right. Then again, I should notice that I have EX(P)OSE for 62!
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEEOSX -  +0 15
#note Crap. Back from the computer, I finally notice EXPOSE. Don't block it...
>Steve_Bush: ?AADGMS C5 MASsAG.D +62 144
#note Grr! At this point I'm really down on myself, deservedly. And why not DAMAGES at 12H?
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEEOSX D3 AXE +24 39
#note B10 APEXES scores, but I didn't see it. 5C MOXA might be the best combo of points and leave.

>Steve_Bush: DERY 12H .ERDY +24 198
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGGLST 14F ST.AGGLE +66 130
#note I have to take it and hope to hit the hooks.
>Steve_Bush: CEIST N10 CITES +48 246
#note Shucks.
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEEFSWY B3 BEEF +35 165
#note Plenty of vowels left to draw.
>Steve_Bush: IT E3 TI +13 259
>Brendan_Sullivan: DIMSWYZ F10 W.Y +30 195
#note F4 SIZY seems like a wasted S. Then again, I wasn't sure about NONES, so I'm not sure where I was going to use it.
>Steve_Bush: AEK A1 KEA +25 284
>Brendan_Sullivan: DIMSUVZ E1 ZI..S +40 235
#note Now I attempt to start racking up some points, disregarding my leaves, for the most part. Quackle likes 13M DEV a bit more. I guess it's unlikely that Steve will take the ZITIS spot.
>Steve_Bush: JU 8A JU. +27 311
>Brendan_Sullivan: DMOOUUV 1E .OOM +45 280
>Steve_Bush: DII H1 .IDI +8 319
>Brendan_Sullivan: DFHTUUV -DFHUUV +0 280
#note I felt I couldn't ignore the leave anymore. Quackle still likes M13 DEV, or else F1 OFT. Any idea why?
>Steve_Bush: CINOR 4H .RONIC +16 335
#note He started to lay this down, then took it back. I internally screamed for the N as soon as I saw him place it.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EEINRTV K1 REI.VENT +77 357
#note Yes, he did play it!
>Steve_Bush: HNOQUVW M1 VOU.H +26 361
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEFLQR 11M Q. +11 368
#note With perfect play from here (I start with F1 OF 26 and eat the Q), I finish with an 8 point loss. I actually mistracked and figured him for ILNRTU. For a few seconds I thought 3J LIQUER* was the winning move, then I realized it's spelt LIQUEUR. I looked and looked and looked for other Q spots or some kind of setup play but had to give up eventually. I decided I needed to play the Q, and next turn I could get 2J REFOLD.
>Steve_Bush: ILNTUW 13M W.T +22 383
#note What? He had a W? His best play is 2M OWN, setting up UNLIT. My response of J1 EF leads to a 5 point loss. But wait, Championship Player told me to play OF, get Q-stuck and lose by 8. What gives Quackle?
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEFLR 2J F.D.RA +36 404
#note Now I spot the better play.
>Steve_Bush: ILNU O1 L.IN +15 398
>Brendan_Sullivan: EL N5 EL +9 413
#note 3A ABLATE nets 7 more. Oh well, I was just elated to have a win after being down by 129 in the beginning and never having a lead until the penultimate play.
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (U) +2 415
