>Jason: DEINNOS 8G NO +4 4
#note Joey Mallick, upon hearing the score, said "Thanks." I look over at him playing Peter Armstrong and he opened with OE for 4. Made me feel better. :)
>Jean_McArthur: EQRTWY I7 QWERTY +38 38
#note Coolest non-bingo of the tourney. I know Hoggatt opened with QWERTYS in Dayton (blank involved), but I'd never seen it. No need to be humble, Jean, give yourself 38 instead of 37!
>Jason: DEEINOS J6 OI +15 19
#note I really lamented not knowing seven-to-eight anamonics here. Take note of what I missed through the R (the only playable bingo).
>Jean_McArthur: BILO H12 BOIL +37 75
>Jason: DEEENOS 10E ENDO.SEE +63 82
#note That's right. I miss INDORSEE and see ENDORSEE. I seriously think I heard Q laugh. Lipe told the story the night before of how he once played off UM and played NumERATE next turn, much to the shock of his opponent. Apparently I felt I needed to have a story of my own for next time.
>Jean_McArthur: ACFHU 11B CHUFA +38 113
>Jason: EFIIRRU L8 FI.RIER +28 110
#note Like our first game, we're saving the good stuff 'til the end. Obviously the leave sucks, but I gotta catch up on turnover.
>Jean_McArthur: DIIV 14J VI.ID +34 147
#note Who needs bingos? I only hope, like Rosin, she's sacrificing her leave to make these plays.
>Jason: ELMNNRU 8L .URL +21 131
#note UN(H)ELM is best. It's going to be a while before I make a play like UNHELM, though.
>Jean_McArthur: AAAAAAA -AAAA +0 147
>Jason: AEMNNNS 9K N.M +17 148
#note Q likes (U)NMAN. At first I didn't agree, but now I do.
>Jean_McArthur: DET 15M TED +17 164
>Jason: AAEENNS G12 ANA +17 165
>Jean_McArthur: ?ELRTTU K1 TURTLEs +75 239
>Jason: CEENPSS N2 SPENCE.S +92 257
#note One of those "learned the hard way" words through Q showing me I missed it in Elyria.
>Jean_McArthur: GORU 1G GROU. +18 257
>Jason: AEGJOPX O3 AX +38 295
#note A little concerned I'm setting up HO(AX) for 44, but I figure there's a decent chance 1) I'll draw the H later or 2) she won't see it. I almost played the E as well, but I think EGJOP vs. GJOP is worth the three fewer points.
>Jean_McArthur: DITW 11K W.IT +26 283
#note Played W(H)ID at C10 and picked it up to do this.
>Jason: EGJNOPY 2F JO +28 323
#note As soon as I hit my clock, I think "JOEY!" And Mallick's sitting next to Jean! Sheesh! Cut my win percentage from 76 to 63.
>Jean_McArthur: BMO 3E MOB +28 311
#note Scored as 27. Now I'm losing two points in a recount.
>Jason: AEGNPYZ 4D GAY +31 354
#note Q likes ZAG there, but with all those A's out, I feel that's giving up too much.
>Jean_McArthur: AAADGIS -AAA +0 311
>Jason: EHKNPTZ O10 ZEK +29 383
#note Right idea (guaranteed at least 29 with the HP next turn), wrong spot. Can get 47 for it at F6 (killing 7A bingoes) or at 36 at 9C (killing eights through the C or H). Instead I score 29 and leave the board open. Genius. I thought about saving the Z for a 50-point L(E)Z at 13K, so guess what I draw?
>Jean_McArthur: DGO 5C DOG +25 336
#note Scored as 24. Now I'm losing three points in a recount. It's maddening how sometimes I re-score my opponent's play and sometimes I don't. ALWAYS do it! It's definitely a sign of where my focus is, whether I am or not.
>Jason: AEHLNPT 13L .H +22 405
#note Missed PLAN(C)HET. But if there's a way this loses, I don't see it.
>Jean_McArthur: EV 7M V.E +24 360
#note Somehow we add 333 and 24 and get 359. Well, there's two of those three points she shorted herself back.
>Jason: ?AELNPT 7A PANTiLE +63 468
#note Didn't expect to see you, buddy! Again, fantastic timing. Way to show up when I need you. :)
>Jason:  (AAAIIS) +12 480
