>Carolyn: FMORU 8D FORUM +28 28
>Steve: DKLLPQU E6 QU.D +14 14
#note QU(O)LL wins the sim (2 ply 3k iterations), but I just didn't have the guts to put that hot spot out there. If she has an S it could be game over for me after one turn.
>Carolyn: IITZ F3 ZITI +28 56
>Steve: KLLPRSU 10E SKULL +34 48
>Carolyn: ?AEORTU 11I OUTEARn +64 120
#note Give a shout out if you found the separated nine through the M and the L to reach H15. Next best plays down to the M from H1.
>Steve: JPRSTTY L10 J.TTY +30 78
#note Happy to get a vowel to play through, and to score.
>Carolyn: CIN 3F .INC +19 139
>Steve: DEGPRSV H1 VE.D +30 108
#note Debated between this and G(Y)VED for a few minutes. Gyved wins the sim, predictably, by two percentage points in wins, and five points in valuation. I just didn't want to leave the hot spot at the top.
>Carolyn: LOW O8 LOW. +18 157
>Steve: EEGMPRS 7G MEG +22 130
>Carolyn: ARX 6H RAX +34 191
#note She started to pick this play up, fearing it was leaving me a dangerous line.
>Steve: EGHOPRS 5I GOPHERS +90 220
#note Glad she went against her instincts.
>Carolyn: BCEI O1 BICE. +30 221
>Steve: AANORTW 4L AW +25 245
#note Missing WA(R)RANT and NA(R)ROW at N9.
>Carolyn: ENO 3K ONE +24 245
>Steve: AAHNORT N1 AH +24 269
>Carolyn: AFI 8L FAI. +11 256
>Steve: ALNORRT 4C NOR. +8 277
#note ARO(Y)NT and RO(Y)AL lead the sim, with my choice 10-11 points back.
>Carolyn: BDEINTV 1H .IE +6 262
>Steve: ABELORT 14J BO.AR +32 309
#note Duck prefers BO(Y)LA in same spot, and the better leave.
>Carolyn: ?AEINSS 15D SEStINA +75 337
#note Ruh Roh.
>Steve: EGLPTTY 15M YET +25 334
#note Wins the sim. GE(N)TLY is next, nothing else close.
>Carolyn: ADEEIV C1 VEI.ED +20 357
>Steve: AGILOPT 12C GALIPOT +75 409
#note sub-optimum placement costs six points in spread.
>Steve:  (ADENN) +12 421
