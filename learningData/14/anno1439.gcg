>Dorcas_Alexander: INPY 8F PYIN +18 18
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEEFGNR 9E BEEF +25 25
#note I spot BEFRINGE but talk myself out of it. And I think of BEFINGER but it just seems to silly to be good. They both are! BEEF is next best.
>Dorcas_Alexander: INOPRST 7G TROPINS +78 96
#note Nice overlap.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGNRRY K4 GRA.NERY +98 123
#note It's spelt GRANARY, dummy!
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGNRRY --  -98 25
#note She knew that...
>Dorcas_Alexander: BMR K5 BR.M +16 112
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGNRRY L1 RANGY +27 52
#note Didn't spot the underlaps like 10F GREY or 10E YARER. When she played TROPINS I thought of the A front hook, but then neglected to look for plays that did that, such as GRAPEY.
>Dorcas_Alexander: DEIVW 10B WIVED +38 150
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEEEORS 1H CORE. +21 73
#note Bad move. VEE or VOE better serve my interests at this point in the game.
>Dorcas_Alexander: HLL 2K H.LL +19 169
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEFQST A7 QATS +52 125
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?EINOST -?EIN +0 169
#note Obviously this was not her real rack. Thanks Quackle.
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEEEFHT 10H FEH +27 152
#note Never seen SHEETFED.
>Dorcas_Alexander: IX B6 XI +36 205
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEEOTUW C9 W.DEOUT +30 182
#note Totally whiffed on the HALLO hook, and I will mentally thwack my forehead later when she takes it. TOWED there is obviously best.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AEZ 15A ZE.A +42 247
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEIINO C3 NAOI +17 199
#note Reasonable move. Playing it at 3L saves an N but kills lanes I need. Or H1 CIAO opens things up a little.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?AGILOT O2 OTALGIa +82 329
#note OTALGIc is a little bitter, right Lerman?
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEIIKV N8 KIVA +24 223
>Dorcas_Alexander: GJO D2 JOG +30 359
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEEIMTU E4 EAU +10 233
#note Thought a lot about JEU, but wanted to play off an extra vowel. Didn't think of ripping things open with J10 HEAUME, nor did I spot N2 LUTEA.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ?EEINRS 12I INvERSE +76 435
>Brendan_Sullivan: DEIMTTU O11 M.TED +28 261
#note I had MUTED lined up to play at O11 if she didn't play there, so why didn't I see that I could play it at B14? I am definitely going to lose, but MUTED salvages the most spread, I think.
>Dorcas_Alexander: ACDO 13G CODA +19 454
>Brendan_Sullivan: EILNRTU 14J ENTIR. +21 282
#note Didn't see the best play: F3 REIN.
>Dorcas_Alexander: AOSU 9J US +16 470
>Brendan_Sullivan: LU 10L LU. +6 288
#note A big loss, but I'd say I deserved it after such spotty play.
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (AO) +4 292
