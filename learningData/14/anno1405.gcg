#note (A)MPUTEES for yet another missed bingo.  If there's one thing I need to work on as much as the 5's, it's the 7's and 8's.  And, perhaps, the 3's, 4's and 6's.  Oh, and the 9's.  That should cover it.

#note Pat looked at several different options, before settling on this one.  I was sitting on a Z, and hoping she went with her first instinct, which she finally did.

#note So, I got this play done.  The best, of course.

#note And Pat answers back without delay.
>Dallas: EEFHIUU C12 FEU +19 204
#note I do my best from this point on, and more often than not, make Quackle's top 1 or 2 plays, but the tiles just aren't there for me to get back into this.  I can't say I was bagged, really, but it just wasn't there for me this time.
