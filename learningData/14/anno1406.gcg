>Dallas_Johnson: ADLORTW 8D WORLD +26 26
>Pete: AEEEMNT H4 EMEN.ATE +62 62
#note Only playable bingo.  Saw it immediately, and was hoping Dallas would play a D.  However, as I was playing it, I started to have a tinge of doubt, thinking I was confusing it with EDENTATE,  Fourtunately, I wasn't.
>Dallas_Johnson: AEIMNOT 7D AM +13 39
#note the easy 7 doesn't play... but the hi prob 8 does (ANTINOME NOMINATE)... study!  AMMONITE is the star play, but seeing that the Duck may have just invented that one out of whole cloth, ANTINOME is the best play Dallas should have found.
>Pete: ?DEINRS E5 DE..NISeR +94 156
#note I was surprised to find DEMONISER* was no good.  It took me about 20 seconds to find after his play, and part of me was even hoping for a challenge.  The 7's and 8's that take R hooks are a random bunch, and so many of them make far less sense than DEMONISER*. Mine scored better than any legal plays.  
>Dallas_Johnson: EILNOST 13E .ETINOLS +60 99
#note Dallas finds the only bingo on this rack. 
>Pete: AACEENN L8 CANNA. +22 178
#note Quackle likes MENACE 5H, but I made a decision to start shutting things down early.  With a bingo lead, I wanted a tight complex board, which I felt worked to my advantage over a lower rated player.  
>Dallas_Johnson: ?BLPQRT -BLPQ +0 99
#note Best exchange.  Duck finds the pretty but illogical PR(E)Qu(E)L 6G, which does better in pure equity, but burns a blank for no good reason when down a bunch.
>Pete: AEEEISU M9 EAU +11 189
#note Best.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?EGRRTX F4 REX +54 153
#note Best.  My eforts at bingo proofing the board led me to ignore the giant X spot. Dallas makes me pay.
>Pete: EEIIJOS G3 JOE +28 217
#note Best.  I was pleased with the fit here, and I was surprised to see how the duck evaluated EIIS... It's valued at .1, which is better than I anticipated, despite the obvious IES bingo possibilities.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?AAGRTU K11 GA. +18 171
#note GAL K11 is an extra point with those tiles.
>Pete: EIIPSST D10 SIP +20 237
#note PSI is Duck's choice, but with my opponent appearing to have just fished, opening up the O column seemed unwise.  SIP gave up relatively little.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?AGIRTU C5 RUG +14 185
#note Q likes GUITAR by 2.6 points, which I don't mind.  I do like the fish as well tho. RUG sets up a sneaky O hook, which got me thinking that Dallas had the O for an OVER bingo.  
>Pete: EFILRST 14F FIT +31 268
#note No bingoes from this rack, and my play was best.
>Dallas_Johnson: ?AACEIT 6H .mACIATE +63 248
#note Beautiful find, the only playable bingo.    
>Pete: EFHLQRS O4 FL.SH +45 313
#note My worst miss of the game.  I always miss SHEQEL.  Clearly better than my play.
>Dallas_Johnson: ADEIOOT N6 .OO +10 258
>Pete: ELOOQRY L5 Q. +11 324
#note Duck likes LOOEY, but I'm taking no chances with holding onto the Q.
>Dallas_Johnson: ADEITTV -  +0 258
#note Dallas declared exchange 3, and hit the clock without putting his tiles down.  He then stopped the clock and informed me that that was a pass.  Frankly, I wasn't gonna be a hardass about the rules, but Dallas, being one of the more honorable and rule abiding people I know, went by the rule, and it was an unfortunate pass at an unfortunate time.  VITAE/REDEEM would have been best. 
>Pete: DELOORY C11 LORY +21 345
#note I'm sacrificing equity for defense.  The best plays (YODLE, DOOLY) open the board unnecessarily, and LORY tightens things up.
>Dallas_Johnson: ADEITTV -ITV +0 258
>Pete: DEINOVW M4 VI. +17 362
>Dallas_Johnson: ABDEKTY B2 BAKE +22 280
#note KYTE wins by a big margin.
>Pete: BDENORW B12 NOB +31 393
>Dallas_Johnson: DIOTTVY C1 VID +24 304
>Pete: DEIPRUW A5 PI +9 402
#note and I go braindead, as I get obsessed with not emptying the bag.  PURI is the obvious play, and while PI does kill the bingo line, it's a stupid play.  I'm better than this.
>Dallas_Johnson: GIOTTUY A5 ..TY +27 331
#note PIGOUT is the best play
>Pete: DEHRUWZ 3A W.. +7 409
#note I was counting on the combination of frustration over losing and time pressure to cause Dallas to miss my set up.  He seemed to have a play already chosen, and this gave a shot to score huge with the Z
>Dallas_Johnson: EGIOTU J3 OUT.GE +7 338
#note GIT blocks my ZED
>Pete: DEHRUZ D2 ZED +48 457
>Dallas_Johnson: I 9H .I +3 341
>Dallas_Johnson:  (HRU) +12 353
