>Jean_McArthur: DHIORSW H6 DHOW +22 22
#note Jean said she nearly played WORDISH*; don't know if I would've challenged.
>Jason: ?EEHKOY 6A HOcKEYE. +78 78
#note KFC, sitting next to our game, saw EYEHOoK, which would've played for 90 at I7. Well, sure, if you want to play real words! I saw KEYHOlE, but that didn't play. I thought this was good; that HOCKEY could be used as a verb. To set the tone for my idiocy at the start of this game, I score it as 68(???).
>Jean_McArthur: AIRRSY A6 .ARRY +33 55
>Jason: EELPSTU D4 PU.E +20 98
#note Debated between OUTPEELS* and OUTSLEEP, missed EELPOUTS. Shoulda gone with OUTSLEEP.
>Jean_McArthur: AIS I7 AI +11 66
>Jason: AELOSTU 10A .OU +8 106
#note I know AUTOLYSE and PETALOUS ... I just missed them.
>Jean_McArthur: ADNRS D10 RAND +17 83
>Jason: AELPSTT E5 P.T +20 126
#note Don't know PELTAST. 120+ points lost in four turns. Fortunately, the massive bleeding stops here.
>Jean_McArthur: EILOSST 13D .ISTOLES +61 144
>Jean_McArthur: EILOSST --  -61 83
#note Took about 15 seconds to debate the word's merits, then thought "Hey, DISTOLE* = TOILES+D = nothing."
>Jason: AEILMST 13A MIS.EALT +74 200
>Jean_McArthur: EILOSST A13 .OS +15 98
>Jason: ELNNOQR -LNOQ +0 200
#note Decent equity-wise, but doesn't hold up in sim. Q likes RONNEL at J3.
>Jean_McArthur: EFILST B13 .F +20 118
>Jason: EINRSTW J1 WINTERS +70 270
#note Sacrificing the six points because it's harder to trip-trip through a W.
>Jean_McArthur: EILSTU H13 .UT +9 127
>Jason: CEGILNQ I2 QI +26 296
#note CLE(W)ING doesn't solve the Q problem, but is best.
>Jean_McArthur: BEILST 5I B.T +10 137
>Jason: CEGILNO 3G CO..ING +26 322
#note Cute, but I must have a religious objection to playing through the W. (W)IGEON's clearly better.
>Jean_McArthur: ?EILOST 14G O.TLIErS +70 207

>Jean_McArthur: AX 2N AX +31 284
>Jason: EEIJLLR N10 JEER. +28 409
#note Not sure why I didn't play JELLS here.

>Jean_McArthur: AENV 11I VENA +23 322
>Jason: AFILNOU O7 UNFOL. +41 472
#note The counterintuitive (G)AUN for 7 at M3 is two better; blocks her out while you'll still score with FILO.
