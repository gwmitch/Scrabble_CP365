>Wayne_Kraus: AEIL 8F ILEA +8 8
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFGILTV J8 LIFT +20 20
#note Not a good move, says Quackle. I7 VAGI, FIG and FAG perform best.
>Wayne_Kraus: ILY G6 IL.Y +12 20
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAEGINV 11D VAGINA.E +98 118
#note Missed the GILLY hook to get VAGINAE for 103. I wanted this one over NAVIGATE since I know the hooks, sorta.
>Wayne_Kraus: CETV 6E EV.CT +18 38
>Brendan_Sullivan: BBNPRUW 5B BURP +24 142
#note BURB is better, keep the P.

>Wayne_Kraus: ATW K3 TAW +33 105
>Brendan_Sullivan: BEGINPS 9I B.G +16 182
#note Wayne was shuffling a lot, so I was scared of a big response to 10C BEING along the triple line.
>Wayne_Kraus: GJ E10 J.G +11 116
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEIINPS C9 PIE +21 203
#note C10 PEIN is a little better, I'm holding an S. Although that argument applies to my last move, too...
>Wayne_Kraus: ??DENSU 13C ENSUreD +78 194
#note L9 sUSpEND gets 2 S hooks for 86!
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADINRSZ L11 SIZAR +44 247
#note Harumph, I forgot about the -ED -ING for EVAGINATE, just remembered the S.
>Wayne_Kraus: DEINU 15H INDU.E +21 215
#note Phoney alert! I didn't hold, just glad it wasn't a 3x3.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEHNOX B9 OX +54 301

>Brendan_Sullivan: AADEEHN 14F HE +27 328
>Wayne_Kraus: AAENOQT N9 RUNTIER +76 323
#note Even as I was assuming INDURE* was good, INDURER* didn't seem right.
>Wayne_Kraus: AAENOQT --  -76 247
>Brendan_Sullivan: AADEENR N9 ANEARED +79 407
#note Didn't stop me from hooking the D. I was willing to give up RUNTIER for 1 less and maintain a bingo lead with no lanes and the bag almost empty.
>Wayne_Kraus: EINRRTU O6 UNITER +24 271
#note That was strange...
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACILOOO M7 LOCO +21 428
#note Just blocking the bingos that fit there.
