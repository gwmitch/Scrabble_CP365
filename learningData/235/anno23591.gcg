#note I was ahead by a lot, so on one hand I didn't want to leave a lane open all game, but on the other I didn't want to leave myself with no vowels, so I could better respond to more of Lloyd's plays. I did want to get rid of most of the bottom right quadrant, and HADE does that better, although leaving a lane for a 9. I also looked at 13G H(E)AD, but that didn't accomplish anything for the board, and scored the same. But in the end, this board is ridiculously wide open already, and so HAD looks like the best I can do to hope to control it at some point. 12H (K)HAFS was not a consideration of mine, but that seems interesting. Keeping the S is just too strong, though. Same went for I12 AH(I)S, which scored well, but didn't leave an S. I am in great shape, so why not keep as balanced a leave as I can, was my final thought before making my play.

#note And with another fantastic draw, I might actually have a chance of closing this board down, slightly
>Lloyd_Mills: ANRRY D7 YARN.R +20 88
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIIOV 10B VI.A +22 246
#note I think this was my full rack. AEIIV plus two more vowels. I considered VI(N)A and VA(R)IA 9B for 13 less. I considered VARIA because the defense was so strong that it might have been worth the sacrifice. Especially since I am only keeping 3 vowels and not 4. VA(R)IA blocks more stuff, and also prevents Lloyd from using up the last hotspot on the board at 8A. I think I should have gone for it, I sort of had a feeling he would play there.

#note All vowels, kept an E.
>Lloyd_Mills: HTU 12J HUT +17 135
>Joshua_Sokol: EWXY F6 WY.E +18 264
#note Don't remember my full leave, but this was by far the most balanced play I had. I wanted to block the R here, but didn't have much to do that with. I should have done it, since again I had a feeling Lloyd was going to catch something there.
>Lloyd_Mills: EEILPST O8 EPISTLE. +91 226
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGLTUX N8 TUX +57 321
#note Was close between this and XU, but I decided that it was best I block more. Lloyd said I had blocked a big play of his.
>Lloyd_Mills: DOZ B12 DOZ. +28 254
#note I think the play I blocked was QI
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAAEGL C3 GALEA. +22 343
#note GALEAS was held, wherein I swallowed my whole head hoping that I would teleport myself to a new reality, where I had as good word knowledge as Lloyd does.
>Lloyd_Mills: IJNO D1 JOIN +45 299
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACF B4 CAF +36 379
#note Can't remember full leave, but this was definitely the right play unless I missed something crazy
>Lloyd_Mills: OOO -OOO +0 299
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINOSW C13 WA. +33 412
#note After his exchange, I can assume the Q is in the bag. Since there are 7 tiles left, playing a bingo would be a big mistake here, as I would draw the Q and be Q stuck unless I drew the remaining A. So this is the right play.
>Lloyd_Mills: DOR A11 ROD +16 315
>Joshua_Sokol: ?INOQST 9M T.. +6 418
#note I end up drawing the Q here, which is fine. Lloyd blocks the spot for the Q, which is also fine. Just spread at this point. Hopefully I can draw the L here for JONQUILS! Otherwise I'm blocking PERGOLA and whatever plays down M, as I can only hit that spot if I draw the A. PERGOLA is the only thing that plays (I just checked). So this has to be the correct play.
