#note I missed 7H WINY. Nice job me. Although that's only slightly less horrible :P

>Jason_Li: ?EEELRT K8 sTEELER +76 104
#note I held this, tracked the tiles he had played, and decided that since I had tracked the play, my subconscious was telling me that I should release. I used to know this was invalid.

>Joshua_Sokol: IILOPQT 10C PILOT +24 135
#note I thought: he's so likely to have an I here that I'm just going to get burned almost 90% of the time. I have to keep my Q AGAIN. I've been running into SO MUCH Q trouble lately. I just need to stop making mistakes and I'll be fine. 
>Jason_Li: ATTUV 11F TAV +21 177
#note I got visibly pissed off when he played this, as I knew it meant he did not hold an I. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADILNNQ G1 QINDA. +17 152
#note This was pure tilt. A horrible play. I convinced myself that he didn't pick an I up and that I needed to open the top of the board. Correction, he drew two I's.

#note And I saved his sorry ass with this giveaway.

>Jason_Li: AEH 15L A.HE +30 264
#note great play by Jason, as he was not totally sure STEELER* was invalid, so blocking the possibility of having to challenge it was his safest option.
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEINST H11 .ICED +36 206
#note Was very annoyed that this rack didn't bingo anywhere. I guess I had a feeling of what was to come. I knew I had messed up somewhere at this point, but I thought it was on the PILOT play. No, Josh, it was something far more clear.
>Jason_Li: AEIOSTZ 15A AZOTISE. +107 371
#note getting me back for ZEDAS for 107 earlier in the tournament! But he won that game too...
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEINST F2 BE +22 228
#note Another unplayable almost-bingo rack! I was obviously defending against the X here, as I needed to bingo, not draw XI or XU out of the bag. He was a favourite to hit the spot. But see previous foreshadowings# to get a clue about what is about to occur
>Jason_Li: AW 14M .AW +33 404
>Joshua_Sokol: EINSTUX 14E XU +24 252
#note lol, XU draw! Take notes, folks.
>Jason_Li: ?ABINOR D5 ROBIN.As +70 474

#note loldraw number 2/2. Kept my composure this time and made the right play.
