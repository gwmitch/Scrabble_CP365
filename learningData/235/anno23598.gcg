#note Took me a while to realize I could bingo out of this rack. My first instinct was HACEK.

#note Would have liked to play the obvious H1 ROB, but blocking the 3x3 seemed more important. Quackle still likes ROB.

#note 15G DALED(H) was very tempting. I thought ADDEL had decent bingo synergy and I'll often just be able to play DALEDH next turn.

#note Quackle's static evaluator obviously would love me to fish out of this rack with 11D BE and hope for an -ING bingo on row 14. I think this is clearly better since it puts me up by 90 while blocking all the reasonable bingo lines.

#note I spent all my remaining time trying to identify possible bingos through ER (there aren't any in the pool; I came up with GEMSETTER*). I didn't give enough thought on how I would block until I was down to about fifteen seconds and then I panicked and played this, giving up a bunch of spread.
