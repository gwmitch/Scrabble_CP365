#note I don't know... I was positve that if Lloyd didn't have an S, he'd block SEDITION somehow and cripple the board. So I decided to just cash it now and force the top left open. Quackle says to fish with O7 GAZED. It hits a lot of 7's, but there's no way they stay open. I could get DOBLONES or BLOODIES through the O, but going all in on a 62-pt bingo that sets up easy comebacks seems like a crappy game plan. I dunno, BOLDS isn't simming great, but I really don't like the other options. I think I'd still make this play

#note Maybe I should do VIVE and hope Lloyd can't score well from the V. He's definitely going to play there, and leave me to score well with my Y at N6. But I dunno, VEINY is probably the play

#note I missed my best shot to win. 9B EH sets up my M, which might force Lloyd to make a block and give me a chance to catch up in the endgame. I dunno, that's a long shot though. Of course, so is LAMEDH. I'm basically hoping he has the worst possible rack with all the T's and stuff. Over the board, the plan I came up with was to play off BE somewhere (3I or 14M) and make Lloyd think I was fishing for a bingo on row 6. He'd then take a low score to block and empty the bag. Then I surprise him with LAMEDH in the endgame and MAYBE I'm able to win that way. In hindight, I probably should have gone with that line of play.
