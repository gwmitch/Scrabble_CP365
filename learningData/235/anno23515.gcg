#note 13C T(E)nEBrIO does a little better, though no fear of setting up 14J? Hmm. I do tend to overreact to hotspots like that sometimes.

#note Multiple problems, but let's solve this one first.

>Geoff: AEKLNNO E11 NOL. +25 214
#note This is a good one to think more about. D4 is a hotter spot, but plays there leave worse. Quackle likes D4 KO, but AELNN, really? 13C N(E)K I can see, that's not bad.

#note Nigel Richards plays 13C C(EL)ER(I)AC. Dammit, I want to find that. I know the word and everything. It's findable. Considered H1 CACHE, and not sure why I didn't just do that, though my play is simming a little better. I think my choice is more volatile than I wanted, though it has some things to recommend it.

#note F11 KAT(A) is nice, leaves better...Quackle also loves fishing off the K, and I agree that's better than what I did. 
>Eric: EPV L1 VE.P +26 258
>Geoff: AINORRV 1L .IVO +30 296
#note Yuck. Quackle agrees with VIVO, but I hate leaves like that. Don't have a good feeling about the way this one's going...

#note B1 ARRANT keeping NN, no, I'm not doing that. (My exchange beat ARRANT out by a point.)
>Eric: DUU K3 .UDU +22 298
>Geoff: AHNRTWY J3 .HAY +44 340
#note Took points over leave here, foolishly. J1 WYCH 31 keeps RANT. If my opponent bingos, and the pool isn't bad, I'll likely need to bingo back. Though I did make L6 slightly harder to use, at least.

>Geoff: ELNRTUW 8L .LEW +21 361
#note Getting low on time. This rack befuddled me, and this was kind of a panic move. Should have kept my E, for sure. It was also past midnight, and I'd had a few beers. Yeah, I'll go with that.
>Eric: ASTY N1 .ASTY +37 413
>Geoff: INOORTU 10C O. +3 364
#note Quackle prefers playing off OU or U. Not sure I trust Quackle in situations like this - human opponents will block things. Down under a minute on my clock.
