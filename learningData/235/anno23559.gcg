#note Championship Player likes CHER, but CH has to be better, threatening EX, which half the time Tim can't block because he has to stop a Q play.

#note 1. CP comes up with its worst suggestion ever here! It says TIZ +67. It's really only +34 because it allows QAT! 2. There are way too many lines for me to be confident of anything here, but XI makes sense to me, followed maybe by BODE. I feel like the result may be in the +55 range. 3. It's interesting to follow some alternate lines and see how CP's assessment changes move by move. For instance ZA +49 drops to +41 after SPIKE, back up to +44 after OIL (a questionable play offhand) and settles at +39 after SPIKER.

#note 1. CP likes BEZ -17, but it's actually -27 after DEAF, keeping the D for DOWER in response to OWER! After DEAF, a pass is definitely the best practical play, but the same in theory as eR. 2. CP says SPIKER -20, but it's actually -27 after the beautiful response AGA! 3. CP sez REZ -21, but following its subsequent plays it looks like it's -23. 4. My play of SPIKE looks like it's correctly rated at -23, since playing out appears to be Tim's best play. So I think REZ and SPIKE are equal theoretically.
>Quackle: ADIT 7K DITA +15 295
#note Two (minor) miscalculations by CP. Tim's DITA does seem best, but CP thinks SPIKED is +41 (playing through gives +42) and thinks ZA is +40 (actually +41). In both cases CP realizes later that slow play is a little better than going out.
