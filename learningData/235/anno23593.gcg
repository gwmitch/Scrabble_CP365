>Joel_Horn: ABINR 8D BAIRN +20 20
#note I think I really flubbed this game. Let's see.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIMTUUY G6 GU.U +7 7
#note Keeping IMTU is another option. I preferred shedding my U's and giving nothing back. I can see why 9B GUY or E5 YUG(A) would be favored over my play. I opted for maximum rack balance and more defense against Joel, and that may have backfired.
>Joel_Horn: AIQ 7F Q.AI +27 47
#note In all of my games but one this tournament, drawing the Q coincided with losing the game. When my opponents drew it, it sometimes didn't seem as bad. That's just variance, but it irked me, and I usually don't get irked by that type of thing. (Joel indicated that I had saved his rack here), which by the looks of it holds true.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIMMTVY 9C VIM +20 27
#note My draw of VMD shows that keeping a heavy leave with no U can sometimes be worse than keeping a more balanced leave with a U.
>Joel_Horn: ?ADEEOS J6 ElODEAS +74 121
>Joshua_Sokol: DFMOTWY K8 DOTY +34 61
>Joel_Horn: NOPU K3 UPON +14 135
>Joshua_Sokol: FIIIIMW -WFMIIII +0 61
#note All consonants, forget which ones, but I exchanged them all.
>Joel_Horn: ABEELRT 12C BLEATER. +72 207
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGHRTY H10 CH.ERY +42 103
#note Perhaps TECHY instead, since it improves my bingo chances for next turn from around 11% to 14%. Lovely to have a 1/7 shot at only being down a bingo on turn 10! L9 CHERTY is also an option that I prefer. I did not know the word. This was a small mistake, but any mistake at this stage is very problematic.
>Joel_Horn: EEJS 4H JEE.S +44 251
>Joshua_Sokol: AADGGOT H1 GAD.O +42 145
#note Joel mentioned that it was unfortunate that I had a play to the J right after he played JEEPS.
>Joel_Horn: KZ E11 Z.K +32 283
>Joshua_Sokol: AFGIORT 13A TROA. +28 173
#note TROIKA looks better. Only trouble is how low vowels are running already, but ZEK indicates that perhaps Joel has consonants. I think he told me that he had all consonants but one. 
>Joel_Horn: III -III +0 283
#note I don't know how good an idea this was, though, if he had a vowel. I wish I knew what he had here, cause an exchange 3 at this stage seemed confusing!
>Joshua_Sokol: AFGIRTW 15D WIFT. +18 191
#note Too bad no P to play through. L7 WAG is an interesting alternative. Definitely helps with my quest to bingo at least twice. Probably should have gone with that, but I think I decided I needed to keep an A instead of an I because there were too many I's left. 
>Joel_Horn: IN A13 .IN +9 292
#note Wisely blocking my fastest ticket back in the game.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGILMO L6 GOAL +19 210
#note Unfortunately for me, I didn't have a 3x3, but he did block a bingo that I needed! This play looked like it accomplished as much as I could hope for. Setting up a good lane for 7s, keeping a vowel-heavy leave with a consonant-heavy pool, and scoring nearly as much as I could.
>Joel_Horn: FIST L11 SIFT +20 312
#note Joel told me he hoped he had blocked something here. I told him it was the prior turn that screwed me over.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAIMRV 13L .AVA +20 230
#note and miraculously I draw the case blank! It seemed like it was time to just pray he didn't draw anything that could score (he had been fishing the past few turns, and just played an S off for 20). I know he has the S, so hopefully that and the inference that he only had one-point tiles would allow FAVA to work. He did leave that first 3x3 open earlier, maybe I can get lucky again!
>Joel_Horn: ENR O12 E.RN +15 327
#note After a few minutes of frustration that there was no bingo available, Joel makes a good, safe play that likely means the end for me. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CHIIMR 1A CHIRMIn. +98 328
#note Although I might have talked myself into MIDCHAIR* if he had left the 3x3 open. As it was I wasn't 100% on CHIRMING. Neither was Joel evidently. He released his hold when he saw that he had a good play that should leave him in good shape. 
>Joel_Horn: EOOP N10 POO.E +38 365
>Joshua_Sokol: DEELLNX C1 .NDEX +26 354
>Joel_Horn: EINSTUW O5 UNWISE +31 396
#note -6 to 4B N(E)W, blocking my outs.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELL B5 ELL +14 368
>Joshua_Sokol:  (T) +2 370
