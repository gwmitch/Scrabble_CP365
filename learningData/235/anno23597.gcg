#note Missing D6 AL(C)AHEST.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEFMNQW -QFW +0 73
#note Oh, I didn't record this game as having had the Q. I had it, and I actually didn't lose. The Q had been giving me so much trouble, I decided it was worth the small sacrifice to exchange it now. I knew that EF J5 would be better against most players, but I can't afford to keep the Q against such an unpredictable opponent. At any point Joel could make a play that opens up a huge spot and I can't do anything about it because I have the Q. That was my paranoia.
>Joel_Horn: BDDIY K3 BIDDY +29 84
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEKMNU H1 UNBE +38 111
#note This turn, I did even worse. I missed A(AH), and was too focused on getting rid of the U I drew after getting rid of the Q. H1 KAB or MABE may be better than this, although it is true that the U is horrible at this stage of the game, unless I draw the Q for the second time.
>Joel_Horn: GINPX E7 P.XING +32 116
>Joshua_Sokol: ADKMRRV G4 MARK.D +25 136
#note Uh oh, getting into heavy consonant trouble again! Hopefully I can draw something balanced with my RV leave. 4D MARK(ET) was worth considering here, as was 10D M(I)KVA. But I like this just fine
>Joel_Horn: ET F8 .ET +23 139
#note I also thought that Joel might miss (X)E(D), and that I could hit a _EA(V)E_ play later!
>Joshua_Sokol: EFRRRSV -FRRV +0 136
#note I was sick of these draws already! Why does it have to be so hard to win some games? :P

>Joshua_Sokol: CINNOOU 4K .ONIC +20 224
#note This was a horrible rack! 11H NOUN is probably the play here...
>Joel_Horn: EQRTU H10 QU.TER +45 240
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ANOUVZ 14F ZO.A +33 257
#note D4 UNVO(C)Al is an interesting alternative, to allow me to keep scoring for a while. Didn't consider it! Expand your horizons!
>Joel_Horn: AEGNNRT O4 .ANTER +24 264
#note Not a bad play at all, knowing his rull rack. I would probably play J13 NEG here, but taking that C out makes sense, as does scoring.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DINRUV M3 U.DRIVeN +74 331
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DINRUV --  -74 257
#note Joel instantly challenged this, which was a huge shocker! He tells me there are no UN*IVEN words! A search shows that only UNEVEN, UNPROVEN, UNROVEN, UNSHAVEN and UNWOVEN are allowable UN*VEN words. This mistake should have cost me the game.
>Joel_Horn: AGINY M1 .AI.Y +16 280
#note AI(R)Y 15F with the same tiles. I wondered if Joel had seen SEIGNIORY here
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DINRUV D10 DU. +18 275
>Joel_Horn: AGN 5E AG. +8 288
#note Joel started to play an 8 from 15A here, and realized it didn't work. Once again I swallowed my whole upper body in fear
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFINRV D1 FIVER +35 310
#note I really wasn't married to the idea of playing FIVER, as if Joel bingo-ed right after it, I would need to have pulled my own bingo immediately, as he would be emptying the bag. 4D IF allows me to bingo more often, and might be better than this, but I think taking this route is still the best case for me. Not sure. At least after IF I can bingo in multiple spots, therefore I can fish, if Joel manages a bingo. But him having a bingo is very unlikely here.
>Joel_Horn: AEL 1A ALE. +21 309
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEMNSU N8 MANUrES +76 386
#note This is surprisingly the best I've got. It's close between this and a few other non-bingo plays. This might have been wrong actually... Not sure if J13 NE, 14B USE are better plays.
>Joel_Horn: EEGILNO O12 ENOL +21 330
#note this was a great play by Joel. I commented after he played that it was definitely the right play. We were both correct.
