#note actual rack
>Geoff: CEHILOP 9G IO +17 39
#note Thought about just QI/QI, but why not muck it up a little more...OI H7, maybe? Though that's only 5 points, and my play scored 17.
>Eric: ?ADEOTX -OX +0 0
#note Actual rack. Nothing good to play, but what to exchange? Trade OX sims a bit behind trading just A (hmm) and trading DO, though I wouldn't trust a sim here. If this were 
>Geoff: CEHLOPV -V +0 39
#note I'm certainly not going to open anything. Wasn't sure what to exchange here, but CHELOP plus one can hit with some low-point floaters, and if my opponent plays, those are likely to appear.
>Eric: ?ADERTZ -Z +0 0
#note Actual rack. 9F R(IO)T is a little interesting, setting up the ARIOT hook. Trading Z is the best exchange, I think, though he'll have to make a play next turn if I pass or exchange in response to this.
>Geoff: CEHILOP -  +0 39
#note I'm back to CHEILOP, so I'll pass, force him to make a play; best case is that I get a floating N or T. I should at least score enough with these midpointers to be in decent shape a turn from now.
>Eric: ?AADERT 10A ADRATEs +74 74
>Geoff: CEHILOP E5 CHIPO.LE +110 149
#note He'll get points back from the A column, but this worked out pretty well.
>Eric: BETY A8 BE.TY +42 116
>Geoff: AAAAEIR -AAAAI +0 149
#note Ooh, ARAARA! Didn't think of it. Though C10 (R)AIA sims best. I might be underrating the AAER leave a little here. Quackle also wants me to keep another vowel on the exchange, which ordinarily I wouldn't do.
>Eric: ORTW D12 TROW +26 142
>Geoff: DEGRRRX 14B RE.RG +20 169
#note DROGER in the same spot (didn't think of it) is a bit more restrictive and sheds another consonant.
>Eric: AIIL 15F ILIA +15 157
>Geoff: ?DIIPRX B5 DIXI +18 187
#note Not a lot of good plays here. Quackle likes just XI in that spot. Maybe because it doesn't open the A column?
>Eric: GUU C8 GU.U +12 169
>Geoff: ?FNOPRT A4 FOP +19 206
#note C3 PROF is clearly better; should have spent a little more time on this once I was sure there was no bingo.
>Eric: AEU C4 EAU +12 181
>Geoff: ?ENRSTT 5E .iTTERNS +68 274
#note 14H TENTERS sims a little better. It does seem to make sense to play in the spot that's easier for my opponent to use, though CITTERNS does some useful things too.
>Eric: HOO D2 OOH +22 203
>Geoff: DEEINVY 2A ENV.Y +22 296
#note Hated this play when I made it, and I still hate it. Not sure why I played it, or how I didn't see the easy spot for 4L ENVY. Lazy. Perhaps focused on the D1 hook spot, but that's nothing much to fear. J10 VEINED/ILIAD sims second-best, but ENVY beats everything by a lot. I considered H1 VENITE, which is a little better than ENVOY.
>Eric: FISW H1 SWIF. +45 248
>Geoff: BDEEIMV L1 VIBE. +28 324
#note Not terrible, does good things...Quackle likes VIM/HM, need to examine why. MIEVED (at 14I, 14H, or for a different flavor at J10) is another interesting possibility I didn't think of. I tend to focus too much on ridding myself of my worst tiles sometimes.
>Eric: AELORST 14H OLESTRA +72 320
>Geoff: DDEMMNZ F4 M.M +25 349
#note This game is starting to feel tenuous, and this rack was really tricky. Quackle prefers J10 MENDED 22 to clean the rack problems (61% to win); next best is DIM F4 (57%) and my play (56%). If I can get a decent Z play to counter possible J/K draws by my opponent, that'll help. Bingos are a little bit of a worry, but I suspect a lot of games from here would play out with neither of us bingoing again.
>Eric: CELNNSU O8 NUNCLES +88 408
#note Ah, crap.
>Geoff: ADDEENZ 2H .EE +8 357
#note Ridiculous-looking play, but I have a plan here - see what I'm up to? Didn't even see ZANDER for 52, hilariously enough. But even ZANDER leaves me no real path to victory. If I hit what I'm going for, and my opponent doesn't see it...might get pretty close.
>Eric: AAAGJNO K9 GANJA. +28 436
>Geoff: ADDKNZ J10 ZA +64 421
#note Anyway, I was fishing for one of the remaining A's. The play of WEE guards against the (very unlikely) chance that my play would be blocked inadvertently by J(I)NK, and it also increases the score of my play if I hit it. If I draw an A instead of the K I actually drew, my opponent's play (assuming he doesn't see what I'm up to) is probably JARK or JAKS. IF he plays one of those, my out play goes down, and...I lose by 1!
