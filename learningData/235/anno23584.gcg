#note Very tough situation. CP seems to think nothing wins over 75%, but many plays do better. I've found three that I think always win. Many candidates have many close endgames. 1. ON 15G bingos in two places with any draw but A. With A it needs a tricky endgame win. 2. TENON 15D and ATONE 15E also seem to win every endgame. 3. OFTEN seems to win 7.5 of eight endgames, tying with an A draw. 4. NEONATE and AcONITE seem to win 6 and tie 2 of 8. NEONATE ties with an R draw and ACONITE ties with an I draw.
