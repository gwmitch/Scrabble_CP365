#note Championship Player likes CHER, but CH almost has to be better, threatening EX, which half the time Tim can't block because he has to stop a Q play.

#note A reasonable variant of the actual game leads to a situation where passing is best. Passing is -50 (see the subsequent moves). CP says OWER -43 is best, but it's really -59. TEER -47 is actually -54.
>Quackle: DIOT 12F .O. +10 298
#note CP rates WOO and OCHER as equal at +54, figuring on TEER (not OWER because of DOWER), OWED and TIZ. But because of the upcoming response, WOO is betterthan OCHER. WOO is +50 and OCHER is +48 because OCHER blocks his own DELFT.
>New_Player_1: QR -  +0 467
#note A classic situation where passing is best.Opp would like to play TIZ and OWED, but each play allows a great response.
>Quackle: DIT H1 ....T +13 311
#note OWED allows ROWED, and TEED allows OWER, so CP seea that this works out best.
