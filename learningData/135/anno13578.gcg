#note Early in the sim process, it goes to #1, but settles down much lower. YAWL is probably best

#note Drawing 5 doesn't always net a blank. Here, the Q, but the opening allows the dump.	
>Opp: EGHLOOT 6I THEOLOG +86 164
#note What a great play! The extra 50 ponts on a 30ish looking rack is what so often makes a huge difference and amplifies the importance of every decision an opp will make.
>CHRIS: DEHINTU 8A HUED +39 111
#note Q likes DHUTI. I did not see it. Tough choice had I done so.

#note This was the game and, I still feel, one of the best plays I have made. So tough to spend case S. ZESt and FEZ just leave clunk that I might spend 3 moves turning. There was no way I was spending the F with 15H open.Sim likes FIVES. I will go to my grave on this choice.

#note I had felt the spectre of Aretha Franklin as CBB pondered his move." RERERERERERERERE, just a little bit..." :-)
>CHRIS: ?IJMNTZ O12 JIsM +70 337
#note *Now* it is OK to spend the blank
>Opp: AKOY 13J OAKY +42 396
#note How good is this play? I knew I had but one chance - cash the Z and draw second blank.
>CHRIS: AINNRTZ O1 RAZIN. +51 388
#note  I finally cash Z for good points but I have to draw the blank and get an H word.
>Opp: AEGIITV 10J VI.AGE +22 418
#note This is such a good play. Ofttimes you hear "leave one in the bag". Long ago I learned that sometimes that is not the way to go. If the blank is still in the bag, CBB gets it. If not, he was going to have a tough time anyway.. GIVER just opens another alley.

#note Dream draw.
