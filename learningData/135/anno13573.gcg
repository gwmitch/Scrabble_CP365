>Matt_Canik: EGIMSSU I6 MUG +18 18
#note This is a realy tough, cool position. How should I fish and score and set up my esses? The thinking was that SMUG is open and is harder for him to hit than MUGS/MUGG. Quackle likes GUM by over a point, I guess because a lot of words ending in S would be able to come down J. Q also likes (J)UG a little more than this. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: BCLO 6F CLO.B +23 41
#note And things start getting interesting here. CLOMB doesn't take an S, I know it, and he knows it.

#note Nobrainer
>Geoff_Thevenot: IMV F9 VIM +17 58
>Matt_Canik: EILNOSX E10 LOX +30 73
#note Another really tough position. 

LOX almost completely stops his bingos, but allows big counters. 
OX allows bingoes ~20% of the time, but is otherwise a slightly stronger play than LOX. 
EXONI(C) puts an E in the 3x3. 
XENI(C) sets up the A hook that he certainly knows. 
Nothing is a good play here. Quack says LOX is the least shitty of the options. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: DE D11 DE +30 88
#note And yup, geoff is close to a bingo. 
>Matt_Canik: BEINNRS G8 ..B +17 90
#note And now things are just wonky. Is plunking a B really my best play? Yes. Yes it is. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: Q -Q +0 88
#note Said after the game he traded Q here. 
>Matt_Canik: EGINNRS -N +0 90
#note Another bizarre turn. ERING(O), RING C12, (JOB)S, N(O), and exchaing N all have different cases for being the least shitty play here, but exchange N tops the list. I don't think I've made a mistake yet aside from maybe placement of MUG, so I don't think I'm consciously causing this monstrosity of a game...
>Geoff_Thevenot: HSY C12 SHY +28 116
>Matt_Canik: EGINRSU 14A GU. +14 104
#note And ANOTHER hard turn. I figure that after playing 3 tiles his odds of having a 3x3 are pretty diminished, I'm losing, and passing out it not a situation I want to deal with. So I take a shot...
>Geoff_Thevenot: ET A12 TE. +5 121
#note And thankfully it paid off. 
>Matt_Canik: EEINRSS G8 ...S +20 124
#note And plunking sims best again. This has been a really, really, really cool game so far. Unfortunately, it's about to get very boring. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: W H5 W. +5 126
>Matt_Canik: AEEINRS D11 ..E +9 133
#note Aaaand suddenly this looks really grim. Simming with partial opponent rack t?, DEE still wins this sim. I'm not sure if G5 AL should even be considered. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?ACENRT 4E NECTARy +66 192
>Matt_Canik: AEINNRS 3E IN +6 139
#note I don't really know why I did this. I was demoralized, I guess. Maybe I should play I3 N(A) or E3 I(N)N.

#note (U)NI(FIE)D C2. Lol. I've already messed this game up so badly, so why not just desperately fish?
