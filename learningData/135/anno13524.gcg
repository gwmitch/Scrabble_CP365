#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures - Episode 5.  I never really practiced endgames when playing Ellen, but this particular day at club I figured she's perfect because she plays so fast.

#note In a more competitive game, I would have played TEAWARES to avoid putting any tiles in the triple-triple lane.

#note I very nearly passed up the bingo.  I was going back and forth between M11 FATTY or F7 FEY (leaning more towards FEY) to see if I could get the 3x3 next turn.  But then I realized that Ellen would just block it on her turn so I decided to just take the bingo.

>Tasha: BDEIOOT 11I BOO +17 518
#note I should stop being greedy and just play BOOK.  Anyways, I passed up on plays like BOOTED and BOOED because of the pool.  I wanted to play short, not long.  
>Ellen_Levine: EGLOR B9 GOL.ER +24 240
>Tasha: DEILMTV A13 DEV +26 544
#note Okay, here we are.  I was going to play MILK, but then I remembered I'm supposed to be practicing endgame.  15 minutes on my clock! A new high!  I definitely got the time management part down. (For the record, Ellen had 18).  I merely looked for the highest scoring three letter word (to leave one in the bag) that leaves decent options for next turn. DEV is it.  Only TIMID sims slightly better.  But I don't like keeping the V when there's still one unseen. 
>Ellen_Levine: HO J9 OH. +14 254
>Tasha: ILMTTUV 14D LUV. +15 559
#note Note how I promptly drew the other V.    It took me three minutes to work this endgame out (I almost played VATU.).

#note Yay! Nailed this one.  LUVS-->MILT is correct sequence.  According to Quackle anyway.  
>Tasha:  (LLS) +6 583
#note Okay, this must have been an easy one because  I had 15 minutes on my clock at DEV but 12 minutes left at the end of the game.  In contrast, it took  eight to work out OARED--->OUTARGUED.  But I'm still counting this as solved because maybe it's only easy NOW because I've been practicing.  I would have messed it up with MILK or VATU or something otherwise.  If I get episode 6 right, I'll move on to out in threes.  Actually, no.  More practice before I move on.
