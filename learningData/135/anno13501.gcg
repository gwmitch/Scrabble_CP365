>David_Jones: GOW 8G WOG +14 14
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAFHNOR 9H FOH +19 19
#note Sims close with the other FOH. Tough call, but I decided to take the defence and N setup.
>David_Jones: ?AIOSTU 10E SAUTOIr +77 91
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEGJNR K10 .AJ +18 37
#note Another tough call, but the sim likes this.
>David_Jones: BDO L11 BOD +34 125
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGNOPR M10 PAGE +36 73
#note AGON and ONAGER are other options. Hmm... Not sure if I want to gamble on AGON at this point. ONAGER is interesting and I just missed it. I think I prefer it.
>David_Jones: AALTUV E4 VALUTA. +20 145
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DINNOOR 5E .NDIRON +16 89
#note Nothing good here. ION and DON F5 win the sim. I hated them and decided to start over with a new rack.

#note Blah, I missed 13F CUIF, though I'm not sure I like killing the board with that play. Ugh. Hard to say, because it looks like its still worth it.
>David_Jones: IILY C7 I.ILY +12 271
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEEFNOU G1 FEUE. +10 170
#note I dunno, this game feels pretty out of reach.

#note I wasn't expecting to have my big EXAM blocked.
>David_Jones: EEKNT O1 KENTE +34 328
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACDHRSY 8L CA.Y +39 321
#note I dunno why I placed so much value on leaving one in the bag. If he has the Z, I am dead pretty much no matter what. So I should just empty the bag with DRYS or HARDY and hope to pick it. Bad pre-endgame.
