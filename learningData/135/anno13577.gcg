#note Blagh... totally forgott DRAFF. I wasted lots of time talking myself out of DRAFTMEN* here. Actually DAFF is outsimming DRAFF, which is understandable. But I still missed it.

#note Maybe NTH to keep the board tight. Yeah that's probably the play.

#note Yikes I autopiloted this move because it looked so great. But it's terrible! I didn't look at all the great overlaps on the M column. GLIDE is 45. LICE is 40. Clearly better than this. Geez... playing lazy for sure. No excuse!

#note Nothing is great here, so killing the extensions and bingo line seemed fine. I didn't like giving back the O spot, but it was unlikely I'd get killed there

#note Heh. This sims about even with kIWI, which I didn't see, but I was looking for a play like that. I think I may have taken it, but I'm not sure! Funny position.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EILNOT O1 ENTOIL +31 290
#note All of the bingos made it quite easy to bingo back. I liked the idea of forcing him to come up with an 8 through HAILER. Plus this line was making me nervous.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ANPRSU B10 PR. +11 301
#note I missed PRAUS, which must be the play. Still, I'm not sure how this can go wrong. I guess he can bingo and give me nothing back and draw QU. That was suck. So yeah, PRAUS. Really not playing well at all this game.
