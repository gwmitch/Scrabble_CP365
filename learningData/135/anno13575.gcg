#note Blech, I flat-out didn't consider BEVY, which is clearly better. Keeping the D is good because of NUMERATED. Weak.

#note BELLY sims about even, which surprises me. I thought HERBY was far better.

#note Felt like leaving this spot open was a great way to lose on the spot. I want to stay within striking distance. I did miss the considerable play M12 TITI, but I think I still like tihs.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIIJSW 13H JAW +25 286
#note FEZ sucked because I really wanted to play JEW there. Anyways, I have no clue what to play here. JIB seemed like the equity play, but I couldn't figure out how I was going to win after that. If I end up needing to open the board for bingos, JIB is going to be in the way of that. Plus I hated that it potentially gave him easy points for a bad rack. And really, I have to play assuming he's got a bad rack, because that gives me a shot. That said, I dunno what JAW accomplishes, either. To be honest, it was just a dump and I was planning to figure out how to win next turn. Another interesting high-simming play is 4K WADI. Interesting. I wonder how he responds to that play. I dunno if I want to put the game on the line right away with that play, though.

#note Now I've decided to try and outrun and hope he's choking on O's.

#note This is a mistake. I should just to O1 ASK and then hope to win off a lucky endgame pull. I could do it if PGS is in the bag or something. I look pretty sunk no matter what, though.
