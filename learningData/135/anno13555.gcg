#note I looked at this rack for about 10 minutes and looked for the 9s, but I just couldn't find DUALISTIC. quackle likes OXID to create a new lane by a few points over my play.

#note this just doesn't score enough, ENVOI sims best
>John_Wiley: ?AEHOST N6 lOATHES +81 271
#note perhaps I should've read more into his last play of ZEST and played ENVOI to block the easy S hook.

>John_Wiley: AGMY J3 GAMY +35 306
>JD: DEIILNO E7 LIDO +10 269
#note ugh, I had DIOLEFIN but he blocked. OILED doesn't look good enough. I probably need another lane so he doesn't block the G, hence my play...it's still early yet though - maybe playing something like OI and fishing isn't so bad. hard to judge how bad of a play this is.
>John_Wiley: AGIRRU D4 RUGA +12 318
#note his actual rack minus 1 tile

#note I figured I would just try to score enough to keep up

>JD: DEINORV 15L OVER +28 350
#note for some reason I just could not see OVEN - but the best spot is definitely at M2 to set up ROVEN/DOVEN, rather than at the bottom-right.
>John_Wiley: AEEILNOT 10N .A +15 364
>JD: DINNNNY 3F DYIN. +15 365
#note as it turns out if I draw this many Ns I lose no matter what but OVEN at M2 would've made things closer.
