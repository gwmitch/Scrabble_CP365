>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEFIL 7G ALEE +16 16
#note This was kind of painful, offering back so many points - but it performs well in the sim. 9H FEE is another choice that I totally overlooked.
>Wayne_Clifford: DMOO 6J MOOD +23 33
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEFIII -EEFIII +0 16
#note lol
>Wayne_Clifford: ETV 5I VET +21 54
>Matthew_Larocque: EEKLORR L4 LO.KER +29 45
#note RELOOK is valid too, I wasn't sure.
>Wayne_Clifford: IPY N6 YIP +35 89
>Matthew_Larocque: AELNRTW O7 TAW +32 77
#note I didn't think of AWL, and NAW > TAW here.
>Wayne_Clifford: AZ M3 ZA +24 113
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHILNR 9I HI +20 97
#note This felt kind of lame. I figured Wayne was going to score big on the Z and my leave of DELNR didn't seem like it would bingo very often. But I just didn't see anything else... sim suggests K8 HELD - maybe I put too much value on the Es?
>Wayne_Clifford: ABG N2 GAB +28 141
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNNNR -DLNN +0 97
#note That's what I was afraid would happen. The sim likes keeping DENR way better, with DER and DELR right behind.
>Wayne_Clifford: AF 10J FA +26 167
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINOR 8K O. +2 99
#note 28 points for NOG is probably too many to give up here. EARING bingos with a lot of letters, though.
>Wayne_Clifford: ORU 6E OUR +9 176
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIINR K10 .I +4 103
#note Sadly, I is one of the letters it doesn't bingo with.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?EIINOR 12H IRONIEs +67 243
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGINR 11C REGINAE +70 173
#note After scoring 6 points in 3 turns this bingo didn't get me very far.
>Wayne_Clifford: AWY 5C YAW +28 271

#note lucky

>Wayne_Clifford: CD D10 C.D. +14 358
>Matthew_Larocque: ANQSTUV N12 .UQ +22 294
#note Hey I might get lucky - and this is hard to block if he doesn't have an I or an S.
>Wayne_Clifford: LP C2 PL.. +18 376
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNSTV 15L VAST +45 339
#note I figured if I didn't take these points now that Wayne would - kind of conceding the game I suppose. There's probably some bingos I could conceivably draw with the P but I know my limits when it comes to word knowledge.
>Wayne_Clifford: BT 13M T.B +14 390
>Matthew_Larocque: EHIIMNU 2A IM.I +16 355
#note Small chance Wayne has no vowels and can't make an effective block.
>Wayne_Clifford: ENSTT 1D TENTS +21 411
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHNNSU A4 .EHUS +45 400
#note Lol, I gave him an out when he had none! My gut said HE for 34 was better. I second guess myself too much.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACFR 8A .CARF +11 422
>Wayne_Clifford:  (DNN) +8 430
#note -10, some really crappy racks this game. But the fishing in the middle really put me too far behind. Should have taken 28 points for NOG and hoped for a good draw.
