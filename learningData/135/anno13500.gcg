>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEIMPTT 8D TEMPT +20 20
#note Yeah I thought PETTI might be better. I flat out missed TEMPI.

#note It felt weird keeping the B here, and for good reason. I shouldn't keep it. IAMBI is the play.

#note 10B PORT is interesting, but I dunno if it's worth the risk.

#note Running out of time and I have no idea what to do. I considered UNBE to give me a shot at BIZ, but figured nothing is going to matter if I get Q-stuck. With a minute and change left, I decide to fish for QI. The sim prefers UNBE.
>Adam_Logan: AFIJRTU -  +0 344
#note Adam decides he needs to avoid the Q-stick.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEHKLQZ 5G Z. +11 361
#note Ok, the best play is PIEHOLE, setting up ZEK. That's tough to see. I was a little taken aback by the pass, after dozing for 10 minutes on Adam's clock (this didn't feel like a game I was going to win).
>Adam_Logan: AFIJRTU M7 JURA +24 368
#note Kind of a bizarre finish. Adam's low on time, but decides to triple check his tracking and make sure he's not giving me EQUID. But he can't find all 9 I's on the board and goes overtime.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEHKLOQ 14D KOHL +26 387
#note Now I was totally not expecting to wind up in actual endgame, but with his overtime penalty, this is suddenly a game and I am out of time.
