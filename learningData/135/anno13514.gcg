>Mike: EF L4 FE +24 93
>Jerry: AEIPSTU H1 PIA +19 130
#note I considered SPINULATE* for way too long. UNPLAIT is the play.
>Mike: DIR 4I .R..ID +20 113
>Jerry: EEERSTU G7 E.E +11 141
#note Maybe fish off the EU instead? There aren't really great spots to do so, though.
>Mike: AEINT 10F ENTIA +16 129
>Jerry: AEERSTU H10 .AUTER +21 162
#note Now I really *am* supposed to play DUE N4, or maybe even UP 1G. I don't want to get trapped into fishing too much on a closed board, though.

#note BRINDLE 2F with the same tiles, perhaps? I really don't know what the play is here.

#note My reasoning at the time was that I couldn't afford to just play QUAD, because something like GLEES or GLUES kills me. Turns out QUAD has the best chance (5/36) while this is, in theory, a no-hoper. However...
>Mike: EEEGILU A1 GLUE. +21 397
#note ...while there are several winning plays here (LIEUS and GLEES among them), this isn't one.
>Jerry: DHILS 4D HID. +29 394
#note The only win. (Misscored as 27.)
