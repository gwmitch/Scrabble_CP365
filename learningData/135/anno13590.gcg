#note This turn had me clueless. I thought PR(E)VUE was a phony and I missed (O)VUM which is the play I was trying to find. In the end, ERSV seemed like it could draw into a bingo with the nice S hook I created.

#note Oh come on. I decided that  SEVERA(L)S was more than likely phony, but noooooo of course not. I did take note of the possibility of a 2x2 but couldn't find the seemingly obvious RE(PE)A(T)S. Instead I play this thinking that it's valid. Or did I? I know I've looked it up before, but I also remember playing something similar to this in a game. UNSAVED maybe? Mike holds but lets me have it.

>Matthew_Larocque: DDEOPWZ D1 ZE.O +46 186
#note I think I was unsure about DOWED and I randomly didn't see DOZED. Even though this still scores good I'm left with DDPW and the Z is open for scoring. I shouldn't miss stuff like this, especially since I'm notorious for taking my time.
>Mike_Ebanks: FLT E2 L.FT +21 211
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEPQTW G13 PEW +25 211
#note Questionable play. It's a messy rack and the Q needs to go soon. Since I have 3 open Is, I opt to take points and turnover for PEW and wait for next turn to dump the Q if needed. However the board could become hard to score on if Mike keeps it tight.

#note That U pretty much saved the entire game for me.

#note I wimped out of (PE)T(T)ED which is certainly better than this. It felt so wrong, but it also felt like fishing for bingos that won't play anywhere would just let the game slip away.
>Mike_Ebanks: L 14F ...L +6 278

#note Wow, that was fortunate.
>Mike_Ebanks: AN F9 NA +12 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AGGNNOT O7 T.ONG +13 365
#note I figured a bingo from the H would be devastating, but the other side wouldn't be so bad.
>Mike_Ebanks: AEIKLMR B6 .ARMLIKE +69 359
#note I didn't like this, but I've had too many ugly losses to Mike at the finish line. So this one stays.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIINSY L10 G.AINY +28 393
#note Lol missed G(R)AY, but I liked playing this because there's a very good chance for me to play out next turn.
>Mike_Ebanks: ?CGNNUW -  +0 359
#note Yikes. Mike must have been in a weird state of mind when he challenged this, even if it is out of desperation.
