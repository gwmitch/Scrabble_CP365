>New_Player_1: EINORTU 8D ROUTINE +66 66
#note Nice way to start it off. This will make it a bit difficult to beat Sue.
>New_Player_2: EIOOPTZ D3 ZOOIE. +30 30
#note ZOOTIER.

>New_Player_2: ?DHRTTV 11D TH. +18 67
#note V(E)T(C)H, nice.
>New_Player_1: BEOY A1 BO.EY +36 148
#note I guess she wanted to get rid of the e.
>New_Player_2: ?AADRTV J2 VARiAT.D +71 138
#note Only word available.
>New_Player_1: QRTU 5H QU.RT +26 174
>New_Player_2: AEILMSU 2G MIS.ALUE +76 214
#note Didn't know (B)UMELIAS. At least I found the next best play.
>New_Player_1: AEJK 1F JAKE +69 243
#note She held me for a bit, I was hoping she'd challenge. But she found a good comeback play.
>New_Player_2: AEEINOR 12D OE +13 227
>New_Player_1: FF 2A .FF +33 276
#note Too many points!
>New_Player_2: AEINNRR 3F RIN +17 244
#note Was thinking I'd draw another I rather than an A for some reason.
>New_Player_1: AD O1 AD +24 300
#note I guess she trusted that it was good!
>New_Player_2: ?AEINRV 13E RAVINEs +70 314
#note And that's what happened. I drew an I, and a likely unneeded blank. I also missed two that I didn't know, VERMIAN and VERVAIN. I really hated myself for playing ravines this way though. It opens way too many hotspots.
>New_Player_1: EINSW 14B SINEW +52 352
#note Not the worst that can happen, but it still hurts and the X is still out there.
>New_Player_2: AAILNOU 15F NAOI +18 332
#note I really felt like I had to block this lane. Things didn't seem to be going well at this point.
>New_Player_1: ABEGILS M1 B.LGE +30 382
>New_Player_1: ABEGILS --  -30 352
#note This is exactly what I needed. A brain fart in which she thought the blank I was an a.
>New_Player_2: ADLMTUX 13A MAX +44 376
#note I just wanted points. Leave was a bit less important here and I didn't think she could hit the triple with an M on the bottom. In hindsight I guess I like tux better.
>New_Player_1: ABEGILS A8 AGEIS. +30 382
#note I knew she had ABLEISM after she played this. Good think she only saw AGEISM. It's still way too close for comfort here...
>New_Player_2: DDELOTU 14J DOTED +30 406
#note I need points.
>New_Player_1: BCHLNRS M1 C.RBS +32 414
#note Apparently so does she, fortunately she didn't track well and didn't know what I could've had. BUHRS or BUHLS best here.
>New_Player_2: ILOTU N9 TOLUI. +9 415
#note I was 99% sure of OUTLIES, don't know why it wasn't 100% because of outlied and outlies, but I was more certain of toluid.
