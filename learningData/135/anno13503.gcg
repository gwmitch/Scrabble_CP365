>Mike: AERRTUU -RUU +0 0
#note I don't like throwing letters out there with AUTEUR, especially against Carl.
>Carl: AGNRY 8H ANGRY +26 26
>Mike: AEERRTT 9B TREATER +61 61
#note RETARGET is a couple of extra points; take your pick.
>Carl: AGJLN L3 JANGL. +34 60
>Mike: ?ADEINY C3 vINEYA.D +80 141
#note I thought I might be missing something better, but nope.
>Carl: ACCENOT M2 COTE +34 94
#note Carl's actual rack; hitting the bingo would've made this a real shootout.
>Mike: EEMPSVW B4 PEW +35 176
>Carl: AILN 8A LI.NA +25 119
>Mike: EIIMOSV 5I OVI.. +16 192
#note Maybe ENVOI 5B to make the hook less dangerous? MOVIE 10H might also be worth considering at this score.
>Carl: CDEK 4B ..CKED +30 149
>Mike: EIMMRSS 11C SIMMERS +84 276
>Carl: AAEILNO 10I AEOLIAN +63 212
>Mike: EFHLUVX O8 FU. +18 294
#note The first play on the list that actually does what I want to do--block!
>Carl: EINP H11 .IPEN +24 236
>Mike: EHLOTVX 14G H.LVE +19 313
#note Of the other suggestions Quackle has, I can stomach VIOLET M9, but not HOVEL 3F. HOT 11K is an interesting idea, but...hold that thought.
>Carl: EIRW 3F WIRE +18 254
>Mike: EHOOTUX 11K HOT +26 339
#note Now I'm willing to make this play (after staring at it for a while), because the setup is nearly impossible to block (BOB or the like would work, but I'm more than happy with him doing that).
>Carl: DOQU 6F QUOD +37 291
>Mike: EOORTUX 12K OX +44 383
#note Bam.
>Carl: ABBIOSS I2 O. +2 293
#note Carl's actual rack. Do you see his plan?
>Mike: EGORTTU 1H GROUT +24 407
#note Quackle thinks there's some one-in-a-thousand nightmare where this loses and ERUGO wins; I'll take my chances. I'm certainly not ignoring the line and playing at 15K.
>Carl: ?ABBISS 15A SuBBASI. +97 390
#note Nice fish, and nice hit, but it's not enough. I held this long enough to find my next play.
>Mike: ADEFITZ 15K FAZED +62 469
>Carl: U F11 .U +4 394
#note At long last, victory.
>Carl:  (IT) +4 398
