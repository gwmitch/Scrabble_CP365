#note I'm a little surprised by the sim result here - I chose this because, if I had to open a hot-spot (my only other bingos are 7H PIGNORA and G4 APRONING), this would be the most restrictive in terms of what he could really hurt me with. Q disagrees, but the difference in the sim is nominal.  In a short 2-ply sim this trails 7H PIGNORA by less than 1 point and wins 0.3% less often.

#note Chris told me post-mortem that this was his rack.  
>Jim_Burlant: BCLSTTV 5E BL.T +12 79
#note There are times I just don't get Quackle.  My previous game I was supposed to play WOO for 26 and keep AEOU, but I'm not supposed to play through here when I can kill both 2x2 threats and somewhat balance the rack??  This isn't great but I don't see a reason to exchange.  Q disagrees, saying I should exchange 5, keeping ST or exchange 4, keeping CST.

>Jim_Burlant: ACGHSTV 12A CHATS +36 115
#note I wasn't thrilled about burning all my good tiles and keeping VG, but in my own mind I just couldn't justify playing for 11 with 36 points available and 5 tiles turned.  ACHST is great, but if I don't draw an E I've turned down a lot of points.  And given my next draw, I'm glad I did this.  Quackle wants me to play VEG 10D for 11 and says this wins 3% less often and sims 8 points down.  
>Chris_Schneider: DEIORST A8 DIRE.T +27 94
#note Again, his rack.  And this was the turn where he lost the game.  He didn't know the S back hook to FAENA, and he never saw GRODIEST 9G.  His best play is pretty sick:  DRO(OP)IEST 3C 76.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLQVW H1 AWE +31 146
#note I put this down figuring I'd take the 31 points and exchange on the next turn if I had to. This is the sim bronze medalist, but it sims a bit down and for good reason.  Best is definitely C9 VAGAL, which I never thought of.  But I benefit from this mistake.
>Chris_Schneider: OR A8 ......OR +33 127
>Jim_Burlant: AGLQVXY C9 GAL.XY +38 184
#note Had to get one right somewhere.  This is clearly best, nothing else worth consideration.  64% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: IM E3 MI. +15 142
>Jim_Burlant: EFIOQTV 4D Q. +22 206
#note Way too much of an autopilot play.  Before he opened the Q spot I was considering blocking with B6 VOE but saw the easy Q opening and decided it was time to dump it. The best play here is utterly sick:  OVE(R)F(I)T 7B.  This is decent, but OVERFIT wins 6% more often.  70% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: EEJ B6 JEE +29 171
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIOTV F10 FE +28 234
#note I'd been fixating on taking this spot out for a while, so I put this down.  I never saw C6 OF, which should have been the play.  
>Chris_Schneider: MOS C5 SOM +24 195
>Jim_Burlant: IINOTUV -IOUV +0 234
#note I figured that anything I put down gave more back than I got, and if he couldn't bingo (and it was becoming pretty obvious he didn't know the FAENA back hook given that he was dumping S's) he couldn't do anything but open up, so I opted to trade here.  Q agrees for the most part, though it thinks I should throw in 7 tiles.  I'd make this play again.
>Chris_Schneider: B 6B ..B +12 207
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADDINR I1 AND +29 263
#note The lone playable bingo, which I never saw, was 9G (G)RANDkID.  I saw this, saw that it scored well and put him in a position to have to open for me, and put it down. It takes a while for the sim to sort itself out, but the 64-point bingo is not best here.  This winds up being best, and it's 91-1/2% to win in a short sim.
>Chris_Schneider: OW 6G .OW +8 215
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIOTT J4 dITTOED +72 335
#note This is my highest scoring bingo, but it's apparently not best - Q says that I should play DOTIEsT J4 for 70 and not put the E next to the double-letter at I9.  Whatever - 98% to win.  Play incorrectly scored as 73.
>Chris_Schneider: EEELSTY K8 STEELY +25 240
#note Again, this was his rack.  Yet another no-go for Chris.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEINOU 13K .OU +12 347
#note This is the highest valuation play though it doesn't win the most often...though in reality the sim is very misleading here.  Everything wins more than 99%.  
>Chris_Schneider: EHINORS L2 INSHORE +76 316
#note Supposedly the N8 placement wins 5% more often than this, but I think that's a smokescreen.  Given his next draw, he was toast no matter what he put down here.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIINU M1 UNAI +16 363
#note No bingos play.  It's either this or 13A TAXI and I wanted to take the bag down to 1.  Q prefers 13A TAXI by a statistically insignificant margin. The one thing to be said about TAXI is that it doesn't give him a place to play CALVING if he drew that out of the bag - something I failed to consider at the time.
>Chris_Schneider: AVV G11 VAV +19 335
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEIIIZ 2K Z..E +26 389
#note Best is apparently N4 CoZ for 38.

#note Chris went over on time.  Final score recorded as 348 - 421.  What we have to wonder is how this game would have panned out had he found GRODIEST when he played DIRECT?  As for how I think I played this - it was a grind.  These were the sort of clunk overloaded racks that I often have a very difficult time seeing through, and there certainly was room for improvement.  But I'll take it.
