#note I see MOG H13, but holding ADEN on the resulting board seems totally useless. I'm trying to make use of my O here and set up an overlap for myself. 
>Robin_Lewis: FOY 13C FOY +27 222
#note This shows me that she clearly doesn't have an S, and she sighed as she drew, so I thought she still didn't have one. 
>Matt_Canik: CDINNOT 13H C.NOID +18 214
#note Utterly confused by this turn. It seems dumb to fish because that's just not going to lead to anything. I don't feel a pressing need to block ELECTIONS because she pulled 3 tiles, didn't have an S last turn, and sighed as she turned over her new tiles. Quackle's top 4 plays all block the spot, but there's no way to simulate "I don't think the opponent has an S".
>Robin_Lewis: ?EHORSV 15C sHOVERS +109 331
#note But apparently she did have an S! I'm never trying to make reads off an opponent again. I have no idea what she drew that could have possibly warranted a sigh.
