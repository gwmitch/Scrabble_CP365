#note close between this and PEW. AEGV seems to score more flexibly next turn but the sim is a dead heat.

#note I wasn't going to try this, especially because I saw that I had SEWERING 2x2, but something came over me and I gave it a shot. maybe it's because I saw the statue of the Negresse at MOMA the night before. NEGRESS# is csw.
