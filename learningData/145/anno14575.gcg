#note Huh. I did not consider M5 SET setting up a potential JA- play there. If it works, it's pretty huge. Not sure I would have had the courage during the game. Exchanging is fine, too, I think.
>Ross_Brown: CDEL 8F CL...ED +15 98
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABEFLST F6 FA.T +17 66
#note The sim thinks I'm going to get a bingo down after K8 EF. Not against Ross on this board. I need to just take some points.

#note Frustrating mistake. I talked myself out of LISTABLE and flat out missed its anagram. Both are obviously better plays. Ugh.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGHLRUY D7 ARGHYL +31 210
#note I was really sure this was a word. But it's not even close to a word. Crossing GHYLL and ARGYLE or something. Goddamn.
>Ross_Brown: DEIRSST 13B DISSERT +82 333
#note I was sure enough to not challenge the hook. Though I would have been in trouble even if he had to pick this up. Also, this plays for 103 elsewhere

#note I didnt want to play NENE because there were so many awful tiles to draw. It seemed my best shot was a good short draw. Sims says NENE is better though

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGNNRU A8 GENU +21 315
#note Yeah GENUA. This is pretty hopeless anyways

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AMNRSU M9 MA +20 335
#note Hey this gives me a shot. I need the T to be in the bag so he can't block. But I'll also need the H to be there, because otherwise he can outrun a bingo with the HW. So it's a remote shot.
