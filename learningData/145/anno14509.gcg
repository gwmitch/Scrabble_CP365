#note Best.  BATON 8D also worth consideration.

#note Not good.  I didn't like 9F AYS - it gives up way too many front hooks, not to mention the vowel placement issues at 10F.  Not seeing that, 5I YWIS looks decent, but, duplicated S or not, I *hate* floating an S like that for two extra points - it telegraphs the rack and makes it too easy for him to play from/through.  This sims roughly 5 points down and wins 2% less often than AYS.

#note This is where I knew I was in for a bad game.  It's still very early and the only way he can really hurt me with more than a big play is if he's got one of only two P's...and he's got it. At least he didn't hit me with the Z here.
>Jim_Burlant: ACFMSTX I1 FAX +40 111
#note Not much choice here.  This is best, winning 31%.
>Paul_Holser: ?EEGILZ E9 ELEGIZe +84 212
#note Best bingo for Paul, due to where he chose to slot the blank.  Paul is 86% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: CLMNPST 15D P.LTS +27 138
#note Hated giving up my S but felt that the points plus board position dictated that I do this, especially since this gives me an S front hook.  Q says 13C CLIPT was the play.  8.7% to win.
>Paul_Holser: FO H1 OF +36 248
>Jim_Burlant: CEELMNO L1 MELO. +20 158
#note Saw LIMOCENE* but wasn't sure it would stay on the board.  This was bad - I saw the play I should have made as I was entering this rack into Quackle:  CLOZE 14B scores 44.  I missed it.
>Paul_Holser: DOOV 13B OVO.D +18 266
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEINO 1K A.ICE +27 185
#note Reasonable play but not best.  14E ZOEA keeps a much better CEIN and scores comparably to this.  At the time I was just trying to open up lines.  At any rate, this did work out.
>Paul_Holser: ILRT B10 LIR.T +14 280
>Jim_Burlant: EENOSTU 14H OUTSEEN +70 255
#note Only bingo.  19% to win.
>Paul_Holser: EINNR 15K INNER +27 307
>Jim_Burlant: EHHIOQU 13M HO +25 280
#note Blinded by the presence of the 2 H's, and I thought I'd try to give him a line to defend, as I was hoping to be able to hit something with the Q down one of the triple lines.  Best is QUOIT J10 despite keeping both the H's. 
>Paul_Holser: ACDEENT O7 ENACTED +90 397
#note Well, he certainly defended the O column, didn't he?  He's 93% to win with this, which means I have a 7% chance to win.  What miracle can I conjure up to win this game?
>Jim_Burlant: EHIQRUV A6 QUIRE +44 324
#note If Q is to be believed, apparently I should leave the triple open aand play at J10 with  QUIRT - I thought that at this point I needed to cut my losses.
>Paul_Holser: ADKRY K8 DARKY +36 433
>Jim_Burlant: GHIOSUV C1 GUVS +24 348
#note Best is B2 SHOGI.  I missed it.
>Paul_Holser: ?ABE 1A BE.An +24 457
>Paul_Holser:  (HIO) +12 469
#note While I don't think this was a winnable game, I'm also not entirely thrilled with how I played.  I should have been able to find a better play than WINY. And even though the scoreboard points from the MELON/AMICE/OUTSEEN sequence probably came out in the wash when I missed CLOZE, I should never have missed that.  It's on me that I lost by 121 points.  Props to Paul for a well played game.
