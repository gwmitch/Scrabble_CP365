>whatnoloan: CDEEOUZ 10H O.ZE +33 108
#note I didn't see any options outside of OOZED and OOZE, and I thought the hook for OOZE plus a better points + leave for OOZE was enough to offset his higher scores after OOZE. Quackle agrees.
>Kolton: ?AEEFPT 11K FE +20 82
#note Probably better to score with FRAT, while keeping a good S hook open, something FE and RAFT don't do as well.
>whatnoloan: CDELNUW L8 WED.LN +43 151
#note I should maybe be playing DEW here because the board shape is very desirable. If he bingos on rows 11-13 after DEW though, I'm in some trouble. This is a tough position, though I like DEW a little bit more than WEDELN at the moment.

#note I wanted to try to get him to think I had the X, and try to block, but he wasn't going for that or just didn't think of it I suppose. The fact that I took a long time on this play also makes it less likely that I have the X. I need to practice situations where I know my opponent's rack, because in this case I could play AURA M12, which sets up a scoring spot he can't do anything with.

#note Really nice play by Kolton. BOOKmAN is also available though and may be better. I actually might've challenged BOOKmAN, as it doesn't look familiar. I held this for a bit but released it.

>whatnoloan: DEGIMOR 2B GRIMED +35 357
#note I saw HOGTIES next turn but didn't see HOGTIED this turn. Quackle heavily favors HOGTIED in a sim but I'm not convinced. If I draw the S after GRIMED I'm in great shape, while after HOGTIED the game will likely just be back and forth scoring, a battle I'm behind in. On the other hand, HOGTIED isn't an all-or-nothing strategy, which is good for me here as I can often outplay Kolton in the pre-endgame/endgame. Like the CDELNUW rack, I'm really not sure about this decision.
