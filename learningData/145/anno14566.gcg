>Matthew_Larocque: AIKLNPT 8H PLINK +32 32
#note This is the most miserable tournament I've ever had, so I'm not in a big rush to post all these games where I play like garbage. But Allan was nice enough to give me all his racks, so I will post this one for now. 
>Allan_Simon: ?AEFRRV I7 F.AVoRER +69 69
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGIQST 15F QATS +53 85
#note Yeah I should probably play QIS instead.
>Allan_Simon: ADIINPS M5 DIPS +22 91
#note Don't agree with Allan's choice here, he can score the same amount of points or more without using the S. I just used up an S, so I don't think he needs to be that worried about defense. I like PA(R)DI to set up his S next turn, although (K)IDNAP does score 26.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGITU K6 GU.ITE +14 99
#note Unfortunately I didn't see the U hook on PLINKS which would have really helped here. G6 ETUI sim best.
>Allan_Simon: ACDIINU L2 UNCI +15 106
#note You missed it too, Allan! Plus, I would play DUCI or DUI instead. I(R)ACUND if you're not afraid.
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEEMR 12D BEAME. +22 121
#note I spent forever on the previous turn and again here. Thought about 14G BA(R)E and AB J10. I didn't know AMEBA/E or AMBEER, and forgot about MABE. This play is a phony.
>Allan_Simon: ADIINTT 13B TAINT +18 124
#note INDIT(E) is a nice fit, I just noticed DIT(E). IN(E)DITA is pretty cool too. Allan can keep a better leave here for similar points.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIOORU L10 ODOUR +17 138
#note Still can't see UPLINKS. AUDI(T)OR is pretty ballsy.
>Allan_Simon: ADEHILS B10 HAL.ED +36 160
#note Or HIL(T)ED. HA(U)LED sims highest.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILOOW 11E WOO +31 169
#note I didn't like leaving that huge S hook open that Allan created, but sim agrees here.
>Allan_Simon: ?AILRSZ 15A A.Z +39 199
#note He missed LIZARdS fRAZILS and bRAZILS. I didn't know the latter two myself.
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEGIL A7 CAGE +26 195
#note I nearly played GALEA, then thought about GLACE, and then just played this. Sim likes GLACE best.
>Allan_Simon: ?EILRSU D12 ..LE +22 221
#note As I type this rack in I noticed pURLI(N)ES pretty quickly. There's two other ones - pURLIE(U)S and LIqUE(U)RS.
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNSTW 2J WA.LS +32 227
#note Sim is going for the W dump, but it's hard to turn down 32 here.
>Allan_Simon: ?HIRSUY M11 HIS +25 246
#note Sim likes YI(R)R and Y(A)H best, and SHRI 15L is better if he wants to burn the S.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINNNT J13 NE +10 237
#note I dunno what to do here! NE at N6 isn't going to work. I asked Champ and N6 NE is still the choice.
>Allan_Simon: ?BRRRUY 7A .URRY +11 257
#note Thankfully he missed 10F BY, and UPLINKS.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIMNNTY 10F MY +33 270
>Allan_Simon: ?BFIOOR 1H ROOF +31 288
#note Nothing else scores as good here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINNTT 6M .N +4 274
#note This was a fish for TENTO(R)IA, and if it missed then maybe I can score something on the TWS. I'm probably not far enough behind for such gambles..... I missed ET(N)A for 24. INE(P)T sims best though.
>Allan_Simon: EX 1N EX +29 317
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINTT O4 TINTAGE +80 354
#note I can't decide whether to fish again or score points. But playing a phony that empties the bag is never the right choice! Duh! However, when I put Allan's rack into the sim it basically says I'm screwed no matter what.
>Allan_Simon: ?BDEEIV 3D BEDEVIl +69 386
#note Nice bingo, and good game allan.
>Allan_Simon:  (IJOO) +22 408
#note I went down to 334 after the time penalty. I know I keep telling myself to play faster, but Scrabble is hard sometimes geez!
