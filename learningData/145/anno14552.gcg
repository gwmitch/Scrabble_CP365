>Mimmo: AINU 8H UNAI +8 8
>Curran: ACEHORU K4 HOUR. +16 16
#note Ex. OU simulates well but I didn't want to leave everything for him to play through. HUE (9H) accomplishes this better.
>Mimmo: BEIZ L1 BIZE +46 54
>Curran: ACDEKRU M2 DARK +49 65
#note Also ARCKED. (B)UCK compares, but leaving that Z floating there scared me. Turns out MIMMO did play an A on the following turn.
>Mimmo: AEP N3 PEA +32 86
>Curran: CEENRUX 1H EXUR. +42 107
#note compares well this EXEC (O5) but would prefer keeping the E with all the open lines.
>Mimmo: HIS O1 HIS +33 119
>Curran: CEEELNR O5 ERNE +19 126
#note Thought I was missing something  but should trust my insticts. ERNE wins by a large margin. Have to close that lane. BETTY'S FEET!
>Mimmo: ?ADGINV I7 I.VADiNG +68 187
#note I didn't know DEAVING either. Lots of openings now.
>Curran: AACELRS 11F CAL.ERAS +72 198
#note Didn't know SCALARE. Wouldn't have thought I'd find CALDERAS. Glad to see it was my only option.
>Mimmo: Y 10I .Y +26 213
>Curran: DIOQRUV L9 QU.D +28 226
#note With so many unseen O's, QUOD(S) was probably better.
>Mimmo: AIO F11 .IAO +8 221
>Curran: EGIJORV 2D JIVER +25 251
#note In my head, I gave JIVER go ahead on JUG because I retained an O for a decent parallel play. Still forgetting all the unseen O's, so it came to bite me in the ass.
>Mimmo: ?EILOST D2 .OLlIEST +80 301
#note BEST
>Curran: CDFGOTT 8A FOG. +24 275
#note BEST
>Mimmo: AEW C3 WAE +25 326
>Curran: CDEINTT E1 C.TED +31 306
#note The bag is light in vowels (besides the O). C(I)TED is better than IN(S)ECT.
>Mimmo: EFM 3G FEM +27 353
>Curran: ILMNNNT M8 NIM. +23 329
#note T(A)NNIN has better equity in not keeping the double N. I would have definitely played it if I saw it, but NIM(S) sims higher. I don't know what Quackle is seeing in it.
>Mimmo: ALOSTWY -  +0 353
#note Didn't think NIM took an S, was thinking of NAM.
>Curran: ALNNOST 13C TON.L +12 341
#note Starting to look grim. I need to keep options open. Want at least a low prob lane through the F. If I need to, maybe try to phony with CIAOS. 13L plays sim high, but with the last S I can get those later, maybe with some of the higher point tiles out there. TONAL also leaves me with the last A for the ATONAL hook. I liked this play.
>Mimmo: EGY 12B GEY +26 379
>Curran: ALNOSTT 13L SLOT +23 364
#note Unfortunately, I'm running out of time. I think I need Mimmo to make a mistake so I spend too long thinking about hooking an S on CIAOS. I miss LOGAN but instead just go with SLOT. Both lose there are many places to dump ANT.
>Mimmo: BIOOPTW B4 TWO +19 398
>Curran: ANT 14B TAN +15 379
#note I can't win here. I lose my 3 points. Unfortunately for Mimmo, I overscored DARK by 5 points and we recorded a 2 point win for me. He declined the recount.
>Curran:  (BIOP) +16 395
