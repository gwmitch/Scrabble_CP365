#note First game of the four-game match with Jesse, the cameras are on, everyone on the Internet is watching me (EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE INTERNET, WHAT PRESSURE), and this is the best I can come up with? BUNGEE is better.

Watch the game with excellent Canadian commentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBPBRhSv_A0
>Jesse_Day: AEPRSST 10E SPAREST +77 107
#note NGWEES+ is new, I thought it was old to be honest.
>Thomas_Reinke: ABCEETU H10 .UBACE +39 57
>Jesse_Day: AQU 6B QUA. +34 141
>Thomas_Reinke: EEFITVV F2 VIVE +20 77
>Jesse_Day: AAMW 14F MA.AW +26 167
>Thomas_Reinke: AEFOOTT 13J AFOOT +21 98
#note Same word one spot over is better, slightly.
>Jesse_Day: EIIILT J4 ILEITI. +9 176
>Thomas_Reinke: DELORTY 12J TOY +33 131
#note He played three I's and I still can't play ELYTROID. This is bad, 12J YODLER is 46.
>Jesse_Day: Z 13G Z. +42 218
>Thomas_Reinke: ADELMRR C3 LAR.M +20 151
#note Not playing well. 8J TRAMEL scores more and opens the board nicely.
>Jesse_Day: EIILSTT K1 ELITIST +74 292
>Thomas_Reinke: DEGNOOR 15A DRONGO +31 182
#note I finally make a correct play (actually looking back RUBACE was clearly right), NOODGE is similar but this is easier to bingo on with my E, after he blocks the triple-triple lane.
>Jesse_Day: ACOX 1G COXA. +42 334
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEHIRS D1 HEIR +28 210
#note Might as well do D2 HIE, keeping the better leave. I'm a long shot to win in any case.
>Jesse_Day: DIL 2H DIL. +23 357
#note Sadly no DILLWEED+ extension happens. Also: the definition for DILLWEED is disappointing.
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEGORS 4H GO..ER +18 228
#note This is fine. No standout plays that I can tell.
>Jesse_Day: ?DEINNU A8 UNmINDE. +80 437
#note This is no good. I held, but after seeing he had UNDENIED, I let it go. I am not very good at challenging players I perceive to be (In this case, actually are) better than I am.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?AEHJSU N10 JUS.Ed +56 284
#note N10 JUNTAS, setting up O14 AH.
>Jesse_Day: BEFNPRY 15K BEN.Y +30 467
>Thomas_Reinke: AH 2B HA. +20 304
#note I found my best outplay.
