#note Missing E5 ABELIAN, or I can fish with E10 AH. This seemed like such a good leave though.

#note I1 LIFEBOAT. I think I've only ever had one multiday tournament where I didn't miss a ton of bingos.

Admittedly, I wasn't playing this game with the same intensity as the ones earlier in the tournament. I could have taken a nap for the whole consolation round and come in 8th.

Still a bad miss, though.

#note She must have kept really nice stuff; I wanted to score while starting to shut the board down.  None of the fishes seemed all that good.

#note I have all the I's, so a -ING bingo hooking VUG wasn't a huge concern. This scores and closes some more lanes.

#note There are five bingos she can hit on the bottom row after I do this, compared with 21 if I don't. Still not worth it at all, according to Quackle, which likes 5M MOI, leaving 1 in the bag, and blocking only 1 possibility, APOSTLE. I was scared of something like PEDAGOG, but something like PILOTAGE after this would really hurt also.
