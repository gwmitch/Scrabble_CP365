#note H10 ENJOIN? I hate Qs, I need to redo Quackle so that it hates Qs as much as I do. Make them worth 1 point while simming or something.

#note This doesn't get me any closer to bingoing after he closes the last lane, but I want points. Quackle concurs: points are a good thing indeed.

#note EPIMYSIAL*, are you serious? Doesn't matter, I mistracked, this play is awful. Ending my tournament in style.

#note This loss bumped me down to third in the consolation bracket, so I ended up in 7th, with a total record of 18-13 +794. A weird ending to the tournament, but I can't complain, I doubt that I'll place this well again for the foreseeable future.

Especially if they don't reuse the format again. Figuring out the top 8 after 21 games was perfect for me since that's usually when I start to implode.
