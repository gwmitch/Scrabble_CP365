#note I spent about seven minutes on this play. There are no good leaves with this rack. I felt like I had to unload the U, and the N, just because of their prevalence in the bag. One play here sticks out as superior, and in retrospect it seems obvious. See if you can find it.

#note The sim makes this closer than it is. Evan is more likely to have an S than Quackle gives him credit for. Blocking NIX seals it.

#note Darn it, didn't Jerry Lerman just do that to me? That's just not right.

#note Believe it or not, this game is winnable. It's not even that difficult. But I spent so much time mooning over SOLUNAR that I didn't have enough time to think this one through. Moreover, I had Evan mistracked. My Es look like Gs sometimes, so I figured him for CEGSUVW. Of all the endgames I bollixed, this one hurt the most, because it effectively knocked me out of the money.
