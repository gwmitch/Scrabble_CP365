>GH: ADHO 7D ODAH +33 33
>Me: AEGINNO 6F GONE +25 105
#note Missed NEGATION. The best nonbingo is GONIA keeping EN. I was thinking GONI* throughout the whole of Causeway, and now I know why. -35 equity here.
>GH: ?AIORSW K4 WARISOn +80 113
#note AIRSHOW is best. 
>Me: AINOSVW 11H VOWS +40 145
#note I was kinda excited, so I missed AVOW L2, VOW L3 for better equity. Burning the S is wrong here.
>GH: AGII H11 .IGIA +30 143
>Me: ABDILNR 4H BLA.N +26 171
#note Didn't know BARDLING. BLAWN is inferior to BRAWL. This is my 2nd missed bingo.
>GH: EP 9E PE +15 158
>Me: CDEIOOR J11 .OOD +12 183
#note PE is telegraphing a bingo, so I blocked with WOOD sacrificing loads of equity. 9 points to be exact.
>GH: AEN 3G NAE +12 170
>Me: CEFHIIR 2I CHI +21 204
#note Once again telegraphing a bingo, so I tried my best to block.
>GH: AJ 5E JA +24 194
#note Unlucky pick of the J meant that I was saved from a bingo. Also, he left the 2nd row open.
>Me: EEFIKRT 1K KEFIR +45 249
>GH: EEY 3L EYE +14 208
>Me: BEELQTX N1 .B.X +26 275
#note Didn't know DIPLEX E7. IBEX loses to DIPLEX, BELT 10B, QAT 15G.
>GH: IPSZ 10B ZIPS +42 250
>Me: AEELQTU D10 .LAQUE +36 311
#note Didn't see QUETZAL. I thought QUELEA would lose to PLAQUE because PLAQUE blocks more lines, and I'm right.
>GH: ENVY 15A YEV.N +33 283
>Me: AEILMTU 13B MA.UI +32 343
#note Forgot ULTIMA/ULEMA O4 and didn't see UTILE O4. The choices for me were ILEUM and MAQUI, and I thought ILEUM was bad because it opened. I'm wrong because ILEUM closes a higher-scoring line and opens a weaker one.
>GH: ELRRSU O3 RULERS +38 321
>Me: CDEEELT N8 ELECTED +76 419
>GH: DINOORT O12 ODOR +27 348
#note DIN M13, then TUGRA M5 from me (which I didn't know), then ROTO/TORO L12 to out.
>Me: AGRTTU M13 GAT +22 441
#note Best. I underscored it by 2.
