>Steve_: AEORRTW 8G ROW +12 12
#note Q plays 8H ARROW. I was going with this, or WROTE 8D.
>Linda: BBO F8 BOB +22 22
#note I was quite disappointed not to have a spot to land my natural seven after Linda made this play.
>Steve_: AACEGRT E10 AG +10 22
>Linda: ENTV J6 VENT +25 47
>Steve_: ACEORTU 12A OUTRACE +74 96
#note Thought the 5D placement was too risky for the two extra points it brings, but that's doesn't seem to concern Q championship player. Or maybe it doesn't like opening the 3x3 line.

>Linda: EFLM B10 FL.ME +36 117
>Steve_: ADEILNS 15B DENIALS +89 267
#note Linda challenges FLUMED, mostly out of frustration.

>Steve_: ?EIMNRT A4 TERMiNI +82 349
#note In bowling, the've started calling four straight strikes the "hambone."  In Scrabble, four straight bingos have been referred to as a "bungo," in some circles, and "Irving," in others. Just color me elated.
>Linda: DGIRY 11G RIDGY +30 147
>Steve_: AIIORUV -AIIOUV +0 349
#note What, you expect me to play with a less-than-perfect rack? Don't be ridiculous. About a seven point error. H1 VIRAL or RIVAL is the play.
>Linda: AFO 14D OAF +31 178
>Steve_: AAEIORT I7 A.E +14 363
#note 9H IO(T)A, about 11 points in equity loss.
