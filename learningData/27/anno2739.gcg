>Me: ?BLNOPR 8F PROB +16 16
#note Yeah I kept nice tiles. Hahaha.
>WB: ALV 7H LAV +14 14
>Me: ?LNNRRS H7 ..RN +4 20
#note Change LNNR? I professed later in the game that LORN was dumb (because it doesn't take S). Turns out it sims quite badly haha.
>WB: AFIT K5 FIAT +21 35
>Me: ?HLNRSU 8K .HURL +36 56
#note Missed HORNFULS 5G, which is the 2nd best move here behind THURL. Furthermore, THURL earned me a challenge. Haha quite tyco. 
>WB: BEX 6K .BEX +29 64
>Me: ?EJNNST I6 J.. +12 68
#note I saw JENNETS and I was thinking walao eh why no LORNS*. Fishing is probably wrong because of its low score. JET[E] M3 wins, but the surprising thing is that Ji[N]N or Ja[N]N 10F are second and third respectively. SEN 9K, NAB I6 are both better than JAB! I can't believe it!
>WB: HIV M3 HIV. +20 84
>Me: ?CENNST 2G NoCENTS +71 139
#note I was so worried that SHIVE was no good, I forgot INCENTS had a higher defensive value. LOL this stupid mistake cost me 3 equity? I earned a challenge though, for NOCENTS. LOLOLOLOL.
>WB: AGNOR 1D GROAN +29 113
>Me: AEINOUY F6 YU.ON +20 159
#note YUPON sucked. I saw NOYAU but didn't see it played at H10. Didn't want to play YAUPON because it scored lower, and I'm right. I didn't know HAUYNE L8, but NOYAU is definitely the move I should have played. I saw FOVEA 5K but passed because it kept INUY, and I was right! YUPON edges out FOVEA by 2 EQ. I lost 7 EQ on this impulsive move to open the board. :P
>WB: ADLORTU E9 DOULA +17 130
#note Wasn't sure of DOULA, but since it gave me the L for my bingo, I didn't bother holding. Anyway, WB was telling me DOULA was more open than LOUD, so he opted to play it keeping RT. He was right, though I don't see why ALOUD 3C is inferior. :D
>Me: AEEGIOU 12C EU.OGIAE +70 229
#note I bingoed with glee.
>WB: EEK 11I EEK +18 148
>Me: EFIIMWY 3C WIFEY +46 275
#note Was challenged! I was surprised!
>WB: AA 5K .A.A +23 171
#note He obviously had crap tiles.
>Me: EEIIIMZ N8 .IZ +32 307
#note I had crap but at least I could score.
>WB: CET 4L C.TE +38 209
>Me: EEEIIMO 4D OE +13 320
#note LOL OE was just for fun. I had NO idea what I was doing. :D:D EMO E5, MOI 1J, FIE E3, OI O10 beat the series of exchanges that precede OE. 
>WB: AELMPRS 14E SAMPLER +72 281
#note Missing EMPALERS! OMG! But I challenged DOULAS, so that saves some blushes.
>Me: DEEIIMT 15F DIE +31 351
#note Missing TEIID was unbecoming. Lost 12 equity. :(
>WB: AGW O1 WAG. +24 305
>Me: DEIIMRT C12 .MIT +12 363
#note EMIT was scrappy but I was lazy to think of a better blocking move. EMIT seals the win despite QI, so I couldn't care less. I thought EM would be cool, but if it failed I would be embarrassed, so...JUST WHACK and win. Strangely, DIM 13A or MID 13A are best. No bingos down the triple lane?
>WB: ?DIOOQS B14 QI +46 351
>Me: DEIORST 15K EDITS +26 389
#note What on earth is SAMPLERIES?! I misscored EDITS by 6! WEIBIN YOU IDIOT!!!!!!!!
>WB: ?DNOST 5B SOND +27 378
#note Stupid phony.
>Me: OR O10 OR +13 402
>Me:  (T?) +2 404
