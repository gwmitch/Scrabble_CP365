>Ryan_Fischer: DEIKMUV 8G VUM +16 16
#note It's this or MIKED.  MIKED gives him the bingo he told me he had.  Made the right choice.  :)
>Dave_Leifer: AFGINNW G6 WA.ING +15 15
#note Quackle has some weird suggestions otherwise for him.  NAW, for one.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEIKS 11E KE. +16 32
#note (W)EAKSIDE.  Oops.  I see KEDGE, don't like it, though it's probably smartest.  KEG is okay, forks the board for me.  I don't like KEA, and if I saw WEAK, I mighta seen WEAKSIDE, too.  Live, ya learn.
>Dave_Leifer: JOT F5 JOT +21 36
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIIOS 12A OIDIA +20 52
#note Takin' a risk or two.
>Dave_Leifer: IQ 11B QI +25 61
#note Phew.
>Ryan_Fischer: BELOOST 13E BOLETOS +70 122
#note I slapped this down really quickly, never doubting it too much.  It's 'cause I took Spanish.  boleto is ticket.  Oops.  It's BOLETUS or BOLETES in English!  First of two phonies I'll get by him this game.  
>Dave_Leifer: FNR H12 F.RN +33 94
>Ryan_Fischer: ??ACHIY 7I HYdrIAC +79 201
#note #2.  He didn't even look at it too much, just kinda rolled his eyes and sighed.  I don't blame him.  I have no clue what I was thinking of.  Closest sounding is HYDRACID.  I saw CHARITY, which didn't play.  CHASTITY, HYACINTH, some other stuff.  None really hitting the sweet spot.  HAYRICK or HYAENIC both play in the same spot.  (I was also contemplating HYDRAIC* -- I have no clue where I pulled either of those.  So weird.)  Fun rack, though.
>Dave_Leifer: ALPSY 14B PALSY +59 153
#note Nice play to keep the pace.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEORTZ O7 .RAZED +60 261
#note Well, if ever there's a time my luck should turn, it's now.
>Dave_Leifer: EEGIRV H1 GRIEVE +39 192
#note Nice.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEMNOOT 14J MONTE +38 299
#note He let out another big sigh at this one.  I don't really blame him.  Still, ya gotta know it.
>Dave_Leifer: ABF 15A FAB +32 224
#note 'nother nice one for him to keep up.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEOSUU 2G U.EA +6 305
#note EUOUAES#!  :D  Doesn't play, but still funny.  I had a dilemma.  Try closing it up, or trade?  I chose to close.  Who knows if it's right.  Sure made him take a long time.  And I noted later that this play doesn't shut the top off totally.  -ING bingos are still possible.
>Dave_Leifer: COR 15M ORC +19 243
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEOSTU 5H .ETO +14 319
#note Quackle likes OE for 12.  I played this for a couple more, no S-hook.
>Dave_Leifer: EILORT 1J LOITER +23 266
#note Good to see he'll randomize his rack here.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEPRSU 3J PUREE +19 338
#note Just eat up some tiles, score.  I guess (T)AUPE might be decent, 'cause it kills that I lane.  PUREE is nowhere near the top until I sim it.  No surprise there.
>Dave_Leifer: DIN O3 DIN +14 280
>Ryan_Fischer: AGNSSUW 1E SUN. +7 345
#note I have to close off the -ING lane 'cause DILATING, EXHALING, and EXALTING are still out there.  Turning a corner, actually seeing that thing.  This sims excellently, even better than SWUNG, which isn't good 'cause it opens an (S)_ lane.  Lovin' this play.  Hehe.  I still don't know if UREA from earlier was right.  He might've had a bingo to the R, then it'd be a whole different game, and UREA didn't close off the ING option, as mentioned before.
>Dave_Leifer: ADHILNT 6K LATH +33 313
#note Nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGSWX 4L EX +31 376
#note I played this 'cause the math pointed to it, failing to notice that WAX(ER) is better as it blocks his better-scoring outs, too.
>Dave_Leifer: DIN N11 DIN.. +12 325
#note Well, I'll take a win any way I can get it, but to steal 2nd by playing 2 phony bingos somehow seems... dirty.  :)
