>Jeff_Fiszbein: BCDEINQ 8G QI +22 22
#note "A common opening play," Jeff said as he put it down. Indeed.
>Jason: AOOORTU G8 .UOTA +15 15
#note Funny ... so many of my bingos are baby bingos in part because I sacrifice points for a good leave, but in situations like this, I don't make the obvious exchange (OOOU), instead trying to solder on. (-11.2)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BCDEENN H12 BEND +37 59
#note Rightly whacked for my stupidity; Jeff scores and cleans up his rack.
>Jason: AOOPRRW F12 WOP +22 37
#note Q likes POOR or WOR(T) better. (-3.1)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: CCEEHLN 10F C.NCH +26 85
#note Whoa, CHE(WAB)LE! Coincidentally, one of the topics at lunch was how CHEWABLES* is no good, making every Flintstones vitamins container wrong.
>Jason: AORRTUW 11J ARROW +21 58
#note Did not know the -A and -O back hooks for CONCH and make this terrible play. (-21.8)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EEFLRXZ M9 FR.ZE +42 127
>Jason: EEIJOTU N6 JUTE +32 90
#note Funny thing was, I had GEE(Z) next turn and saw it but missed JEE(Z) this turn. Another horrific miss. (-21.9)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ABEILSX N11 .AXES +50 177
>Jason: EEGIOOU 15K GUI.E +21 111
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BIILLSU 7H BILL +11 188
>Jason: EELNOOO O6 ONO +26 137
#note "Could've been worse," Jeff said. I guess we were both happy with this play, then. :)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?DILRSU 13C LID. +10 198
#note Jeff showed me this rack and asked if I saw a bingo. Neither of us did ... because there's no playable one to see.
>Jason: EELOSYY 14E O.E.LY +22 159
#note CONCH takes a -Y hook, too? ARGH! EY(R)Y's clearly the play. At least this fit drew a "nice play" from Jeff.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AHKRSU 15A HARKS +55 253
#note Owie. At least he missed the obscure bingos: KURbASH, cHUKARS. If you saw those, stand on your head. :)
>Jason: AEIMSVY 12B YAM +26 185
#note (CONCH)A continues to bite me. VA(R)Y and MA(R)VY are better. (-6.7)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AGIMTU 11C GAM +21 274
>Jason: ?EIRRSV L1 VaRIERS +83 268
#note OK, maybe I'm not dead yet...
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?DINPTU 5F INPUTt.D +70 344
#note ...oh wait, yes I am. Or close to it.
>Jason: EEFIINT 6C NEIF +28 296
#note Q likes four plays better than this, all of which I disagree with. FINITE at 6B and 4B score less and sacrifice the leave. IF at 6E doesn't open well with the R's out and FIE at 10A scores too little even if I hit. I stand by this play, and not just because in this case it worked. (-3.9)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AAEGIOV 1L .IVA +30 374
#note "I guess I can still lose this game," Jeff said.
>Jason: EEINOTT 3H TENO.ITE +68 364
#note The scary thing was, I put this down and thought it may be better to not play it because it scored so little, but by then I'd put it down. Indeed, no hope of winning after this, but Q says O(GAM) wins two out of nine. Drawing A, maybe?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ADEGOST 4A STAGED +25 399
>Jason: AE 2I AE +10 374
#note Who knows how different this is if I see JEE(Z), if I exchange the opening rack, know the CONCH hooks? This one's on me. One more hit from CONCHA on the way out the door. A(R)E or EA(R) is 16. (-6.0)
