>Me: BFIRSTU 7C FUB +20 20
>Tony: ADEEGIN F8 .EGAINED +66 86
>Me: AEIKRST I2 KARITES +71 91
#note Forgot NARKIEST. Went for KARITES because I thought it was more defensive than ARKITES 7G. ARKITES 7G and ARKITES I2 turn out to be more equitable.
>Tony: AQRT 13C TRA.Q +48 134
>Me: CDDEOOV 15D CO.ED +36 127
#note Didn't know CODDED, DOOCED or DOVED. CODED loses 5 equity.
>Tony: AY J2 YA +32 166
>Me: CDEIOPV 5E OVIC.DE +52 179
>Tony: GHILNO 11E H.LOING +44 210
>Me: ABNOPPT 4K BOP +18 197
#note The more open BOP 4K is winning-er.
>Tony: EJT 6B JET +36 246
>Me: AAINPTY 1J PAINTY +44 241
#note Wow PITAYA. But PAINTY takes the cake here.
>Tony: DEFIN 4A FIEND +29 275
>Me: ?AERRSV N4 StARVER +71 312
#note Missing SAVORER and worse still, ARRIVES meant my loss this game.
>Tony: AIW A1 WAI. +30 305
>Me: AEEGTUX 8L GA.E +30 342
#note I wanted to block the bingo columns M and O, but it turned out I was wrong. EX beats GAVE by 6 points.
>Tony: ?HILRST 1A .HISTLeR +92 397
>Me: AEOTUUX 12B TAU +12 354
#note EAUX would have done, but...I was fearful of the Z for some reason and tried to block ZOO.
>Tony: IMNOOSU 3L MO +20 417
#note Tony saw OMINOUS but wasn't sure of its spelling. MO performs badly in the sim, but it could be just Quackle. MO blocks ZO..
>Me: EOOUWXZ 14H OUZO +36 390
#note Champ agrees with my endgame, but I lose anyway.
>Tony: ILNNOSU 15K NOUNS +20 437
#note UNION 15K would have blocked my WEX.
