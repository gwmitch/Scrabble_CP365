#note Decent fish, though here Quackle likes GA(E) or GE(E).  I made this fish 'cause it leaves the R and D open and I can hook ZA for an -G 7.  It worked, but who knows if the higher scoring plays are better.

#note HEADROOM doesn't play.  Also, REHOBOAM or OOMPAHED.  Former, no way I'd find, latter possibly.

#note Noticed later I missed (L)ANDSiDE, but they're almost identical in the sim.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEGISTT -  +0 240
#note Thought he was trying to pull a fast one on me 'cause he was down, and I misremembered actually seeing this word before, AND the fact that it compares.  I challenged way too fast and shoulda thought it through more.
>David_Gibson: QU 6J QU. +32 202
#note He seemed frustrated here, took a while.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGISTT M3 TIED +31 271
#note And wasn't thrilled when I hooked his last play (though I hesitated to set up the S even though I had it).
>David_Gibson: ABR F1 BAR +19 221
#note He remarked after the game he hated this play, but didn't have much of a choice.
>Ryan_Fischer: GGINRST 1F .RING +24 295
#note Quackle likes fishing off the G.  I just wanted to take out the triple, hang on to the S for later (I was gonna play STRING from QUAD until he opened the triple).
>David_Gibson: BEIR 15A BRIE. +33 254
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GOPSTU D12 UP +16 311
#note No PIGOUTS to be had... other play is PUTLOGS (didn't know; know now).  Was contemplating STOUP until I saw the X is out.  UP is actually decent.  OPTS N3 is a good scoring option.  I saw POUT, but it opens the triple needlessly.  UP doesn't sim great, but gets the job done.
>David_Gibson: AY C6 AY +20 274
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEGOST B1 STOrAGE +86 397
#note He opened for me, but I'd've had it anyway.
>David_Gibson: AILNOST N2 LINTS +42 316
#note I blocked TONSILA(R), but he had SILTA(TI)ON 4G!
