>Mark_M: BMOSW 8D WOMBS +32 32
>Carl: DDEERTY 9C REDYE +31 31
#note I spent a long time looking at parallel plays. As soon as I started Mark's clock, I realized that simply playing DYE is better. Then I realized that DEY 9E is better still.
>Mark_M: FOTU 10G TOFU +14 46

>Carl: AEINRSU 4F SU.ERAIN +84 165
#note 'Could I have *given* you a better tile to play through?' my opponent grumbled. He then answered his own question with a resounding 'No!' He's right, you know.
>Mark_M: AEINPSS N1 PANSIES +90 182

>Mark_M: DEEW B10 .EWED +32 214
>Carl: BEGHIIM A13 BIG +25 243
#note You might take the points with HIM in the same spot, but EHIM is much more valuable than BEGI.
>Mark_M: GOT O6 TOG +16 230
>Carl: AEHILMT 3I METHA.. +50 293
#note What does it bloody take to make the best bloody play around here, anyway? What IS the right bloody play, and how often does that bloody happen?
>Mark_M: GIIV 6D VIGI. +13 243
>Carl: ACIILNU 3B UNCIA +16 309
#note I was too afraid to play OILCAN H10, but UNCIA is comparably dangerous for other reasons. UNA(I) 5K would have been best.
>Mark_M: FKU D1 FU.K +34 277
>Carl: ADILNOT B2 O.TLAND +20 329
#note Dunno what I was thinking here. Probably going for turnover to get one of the blanks. FANTOD, FONTAL, or ALOFT are best. Take your pick.
>Mark_M: COR 2F ROC +12 289
>Carl: EILNOOQ 12G OLEO +10 339
#note Quackle says this wins 51 percent of the time, with a valuation of -38.9. Compared to ENVOI M9, which wins 84.09% of the time, with a valuation of .6, nearly 40 points more. No F-ing way. My play is 100% right, and I would defend it to the bitter end.
>Mark_M: ?EHNORT 13D dETHORN +84 373
>Mark_M: ?EHNORT --  -84 289
#note As it would happen, I would have been hosed either way, but this little faux pas turned it around.
>Carl: ?AAINQR 13F QI +15 354
>Mark_M: ?EHNORT A6 HOER +37 326
>Carl: ?AAANR I3 ..NsA +21 375
#note Once again, I screw it up. (I)NARm 5H is best.
