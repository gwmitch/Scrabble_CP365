#note This or BORAX.  I like this better, I think.  Was half tempted to fish for (FIRE)BOXES, but not really worth it.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEHINOT M3 THO +26 89
#note Bad play, and I knew when I put it down.  Frustrated she blocked ANTIHE(R)O.  Not as bas I thought, as OH or HO in that same spot is apparently best, or OA(T)H.
>Susan_Blanchard: EG L10 .EG +8 73
#note Fishy.

#note This felt right, but Quackle likes to fish with OI M12 or 11N.

#note But not that.  Aargh!  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCLNTT 12B CABL.T +20 235
#note A lot of options about equal.  After simming for a while, mine does seem to creep to the top, along with BATTLE or CATTLE.

#note Spent a while on this rack, not wanting to open.  Tough choice of what I want to play with, an unbalanced rack or one with a V.  Neither is appealing, nor is giving her a lane.  Ultimately was happy with this as the P isn't entirely unpromising.  I nixed YUPON early on 'cause it's just a really dumb play.  PUTTEE 11H is best.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGPTU D1 PU.E +30 281
#note 4C PANG or PANGA.  PANGA leaves the S hook, but PANG leaves you vowel heavy.  Toughie.
>Susan_Blanchard: ADI 1D .AID +7 260
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAGITU A7 A.UGA +13 294
#note Best dump.  Don't like YAUTIA 'cause it's even worse than YUPON.

#note OCTAD B3 is le winner!  I really wanted to block down low, but couldn't figure out how.  Looking at it now, it seems like OUD might do.  Doesn't score a lot, though.  Sims second after a good while, 'cause it blocks the bottom, doesn't give a whole lot back on the triple.
