#note BLIND, NIOBIC, and BIONIC are all better.  Losing a bit of board vision, or just lazy maybe.

#note But it paid off.  Heh.

#note Happy with this play.  Rarely is keeping a J best.

#note UNJUST doesn't play, JUST is just fine.

#note SUNN/A, maybe.  I'm not really crazy about it.  Otherwise, exchanging is right.

#note Some weird thoughts going through my mind.  I think I'm better at a closed board than my opponent and I want to keep it tight.  No play really makes sense with that goal in mind. I score 20-ish, give him a hook, or score 9, lose the FF, which is normally good, and bait with a word for which he might not be sure if it takes an S.  It's a bad play in hindsight, but not horrible.  I don't like EFF, but it's best, given my options.  P doesn't go good with 1 F, let alone 2 -- heh, unless I draw a T.

#note Almost best, a bit cutesie.  OrDAINS, which I shoulda seen, gets the D on the sweet spot.

#note Throw a wrench in the cogs, lol.  (I woulda got IXORA, too, I think!)

#note Quackle isn't too fond of this.  I kinda like the setup a lot, and it pays.  Better, says Quackle, though, is 1M EAU 14.  I don't understand it, though.  It must limit the opponent's options, or something, and then it sets up VEAl for 16.  But that's about it.
