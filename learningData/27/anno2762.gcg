>Carol_Ravichandran: EFU 8G FEU +12 12
>Jason: ELSSSTU 9B TUSSLES +67 67
#note When I first looked at SSS, I thought "potential ruh-roh situation." Instead, I win $20 for the low-prob natural seven-letter bingo prize. Don't know why I didn't hook the S to FEU for one more point. (-4.4)
>Carol_Ravichandran: ?ADEINO E5 ADhE.ION +82 94
>Jason: AHMOQTT C8 Q.OTHA +36 103
>Carol_Ravichandran: NO D12 ON +18 112
>Jason: AIMNOPT H1 PTOMAIN.. +98 201
#note Ken Dutch sat down to play Knappster next to us. "This hotshot just played a nine," Knappster said, gesturing toward me. I couldn't stifle my grin. 
>Carol_Ravichandran: AX I2 AX +36 148
>Jason: DDEGINY J7 EDDYING +79 280
#note Not at all sure, but I thought I'd "play out the rush." Good and un-held.
>Carol_Ravichandran: V 2H ..V +14 162
>Jason: GKLMRTU D2 MURK +26 306
#note Q likes GUM, GUT or GUL at G3. (-6.2)
>Carol_Ravichandran: AEINORT 5H .ERATION +66 228
>Jason: GLRRTTV M3 GR.T +10 316
#note Q (and I) likes TR(O)G to kill all three lanes. Exchanging keeping RT is third, highest valuation. (-7.7)
>Carol_Ravichandran: EFLO O1 FELO. +27 255
#note "How criminal!" I commented. Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk...
>Jason: HILPRTV 11I V.RL +14 330
#note Q likes PLI(N)TH (is that where I know that word from?), V(OX) or PHT at 7L better. (-3.7)
>Carol_Ravichandran: AEELSWY M8 WEASELY +86 341
>Jason: ACEHIPT -  +0 330
#note OK, looks stupid in hindsight, but I don't regret this decision. A lot of factors led me to think that challenging was correct. Carol still loves bringing up the word whenever I'm around. Knappster (who said: "You of all people should know that word!") asked: "Did that make the difference?" "Probably," I answered. "What was the spread?" he asked. "Six," I said. "Oh, I'm sure it made no difference," he said. (-24.6)
>Carol_Ravichandran: ABJ 2B JA.B +30 371
>Jason: ACEHIPT 3C H.IC +32 362
#note Q likes (W)AP or ETH at N8 better. (-0.9)
>Carol_Ravichandran: OW 8M .OW +27 398
#note After the game, Carol said she only wanted to block (W)IZ.
>Jason: AEEIIPT F3 .ITE +20 382
>Carol_Ravichandran: DEOR N12 DOER +25 423
>Jason: ?ABEIIP 8A PI.u. +48 430
#note I had my eye on the spot for a while ... maybe I just got a little too fancy. With no good Z spot, I thought I might be able to outrun/go out first. Sim likes fishing off the I for 8 (at 5C or 6N) better. BI(T) at 6K is the clear valuation leader. (-11.8)
>Carol_Ravichandran: AEGINRU O13 GAE +28 451
#note Four behind GENU at F12, threatening I(Z)AR if I play BIZ at B13 and leaving other guaranteed outs.
>Jason: ABCEIZ B13 BIZ +33 463
#note Best, though I put it down and picked it up. Later, I saw CA(G)E, goading her into a potential mistake like (C)UR if she'd mistracked, but that wasn't an option after putting down BIZ.
>Carol_Ravichandran: INRU 13F RUIN. +8 459
#note Hard to be disappointed with this loss: $20 for TUSSLES, $20 for high loss ... and since this was at the tourney I fell below 1600 at, $350 for winning BAT Division B. :)
>Carol_Ravichandran:  (ACE) +10 469
