#note Missed FOUGADES 10C! Certainly not one I would have spotted even when I wasn't rusty!

>Me: AAMNOTU F10 MOA +23 229
#note Definitely a screwup. Missed AMATO[L] 3C for 41. Though MOA sims high, the sheer score of AMATOL means I lose over 10 equity.
>Adrian_Tamas: EINOSTU 1A SNOUTIE. +77 175
>Me: AGNSTTU N3 GAUNT.ST +63 292
#note Challenged! Unbelievable! I was thinking of TUTENAGS too, but chickened out of it for fear of confusion with TUTELAGES.

>Me: AEIKLPR 13B PARKIE +32 324
#note Chickened out of SPARLIKE. Didn't want to play KIP B6 and missed KIPE.

>Me: BCDILOO A7 BLOOD +29 353
#note Don't know COLOBI, chickened out of DOOB and forgot CIBOL. DIOBOL is new to me. 
>Adrian_Tamas: GJ 3K J.G. +26 339
>Me: CEIOPWY O1 WEY +44 397
#note Didn't see WICOPY M10/K10  but wouldn't have played even if I saw.
>Adrian_Tamas: ETZ D12 T.EZ +46 385
>Me: CCILOPY K10 POLICY +30 427
#note Good block, but not good enough. Didn't note VIZARDED because I didn't know it. I saw the possibility of DAVIDIA though. I considered ZOIC to block but...I gave in to POLICY because of its score.
>Adrian_Tamas: ??ADDIV 15B VI.ArDeD +110 495
#note I challenged this move of course. Adrian says he noted the possibility of DAVIDIA or ADDITIVE, both of which I blocked. In retrospect, I should have played ZOIC. After the game, Adrian wrongly told me that LIZARD, VIZARD, WIZARD and RIZARD are all verbs! Hahaha I guess he just hazarded a guess with VIZARDED and got it right.
