>Pete: ADEHLNZ 8D HAZED +44 44
#note Best.  Kind of start I need when playing my nemesis.  I always seem to find a way to hand him games. That, and he knows more words, and plays better.  But I digress... I got this one right.
>Brian_Bowman: CIOORST 7H OCTROIS +66 66
#note Sure, he starts with a baby bingo... seriously, nice find.  One of my favorites.  I really shouldn't have discussed this word on my lj. OCTROI is good as well.
>Pete: EKLNNSY F8 .EK +26 70
#note And this is why I suck.  I have plays that score almost as much, leaving ENS or ELNS, but I got focused on the Z, which isn't even in a threatening position.  I did want to set up an S hook on the bottom half, but that's no excuse.
>Brian_Bowman: ?ADEGNS K5 DE.AiGNS +86 152
#note Yes, because Bowman really needs to open bingo bongo burning ?SS to beat me... sheesh.  Come on, did I accidentally run over your cat or something?
>Pete: ELNNSYY E7 Y.Y +14 84
#note As usual, bad play is punished.  and I screw up again.  YENS 11C wins sim easily.  I passed on it, thinking I'd need the S, as they were quickly becoming scarce.  SYN 12K, while scoring only 12, is an interesting play, but if Brian beats me to the spot, he could run away.
>Brian_Bowman: GJO 6F JOG +32 184
>Pete: AELNNRS 12D ENSNARL. +68 152
#note Only bingo, in 2 places.  Almost blanked on it, had LANNERS and was forgetting the anagram.
>Brian_Bowman: HMO L4 HOM. +25 209
>Pete: AEENRRT J5 AR. +16 168
#note Right idea, wrong play.  EYER 9D wins on leave.
>Brian_Bowman: ADL D6 DA.L +19 228
>Pete: EEINNRT N2 INTEN.ER +70 238
#note Only bingo.  With word knowledge this deep, I can go places.
>Brian_Bowman: IQ M2 QI +37 265
>Pete: BFIIUUV 8M F.U +23 261
#note Exchange 7 wins, followed by keeping F, FI, and B.  I did not feel like I could leave the spot open though.  FEU is the best simming of the non exchanges.  
>Brian_Bowman: AAINPT C2 TAIPAN +28 293
>Pete: BEIITUV B4 TUB +29 290
#note Best.  Considered VIBE, but II scares me less than IU.
>Brian_Bowman: FILO D1 FOIL +32 325
>Pete: EGIIOTV 1D .OGIE +27 317
#note best, and nothing else appeared to be close... and nothing else was.  I felt like I was still in this, and I was getting ready to try to plan for the X, depending on if it came on my rack or his.  I felt the game could come down to it.
>Brian_Bowman: EMW E3 MEW +25 350
>Pete: IORTUVX H11 V.RIX +45 362
#note Best.  Happy I saw it, because it took me too long to, and it significantly beats VOX, my other option.
>Brian_Bowman: EOT G12 .OTE +19 369
#note Well, he must be assuming I just drew the blank.
>Pete: ?AAORTU 11C TAU +12 374
#note Fun position.  2A AUTO and A3 OUT are best. Duck recognizes the scary spot I keep missing.
>Brian_Bowman: BELW 4G BLEW +17 386
>Pete: ?ADOPRU 2G DROP +18 392
#note Find any of the countless wins.  I didn't.  Totally blanked on the hooks at A4.  Duck saws DROP still wins.  Can't wait to see how.

>Brian_Bowman: CEEIISV A1 VIES +30 416
>Pete: ?AU O1 Us +14 406
#note Ducks says my outs win... Duck is wrong. AULD is best and loses by 2.   On my score card it woulda tied, but he woulda got the recount.  I missed the 4 fours on the J column.  I pass up the out and hope for a miracle miss by Brian.  With spread out of play thanks to my tie, I could afford to hemorrage spread.
>Brian_Bowman: CEI 10A ICE +13 429
#note Strangely, he didn't miss it.  Well done, and it better be a darn nice Christmas card, Bowman.
>Brian_Bowman:  (A) +2 431
