>Jason: FGKNNRS -FGKN +0 0
#note Q likes keeping GNRS, which to me is just asking for a three-consonant pick coming back. Keeping RS also ranks higher. (-2.1)
>Linda_Hoggatt: Q -Q +0 0
>Jason: ENRSSUU 8H US +4 4
#note "Here's an opening play you don't see too often," I commented. Q likes UN. (-4.6)
>Linda_Hoggatt: AMRW I8 .WARM +14 14
#note Obviously drawing the W on the exchange. Who knows how different this game is if she bingos early?
>Jason: EEENRSU 11I .UE +6 10
#note Considered E(M)EU, but I (wrongly) assume she has an S. (-5.6)
>Linda_Hoggatt: DE J10 D.E +19 33
>Jason: EEEINRS J2 ESERINE +64 74
#note Held and released. Again, eschewing the L8 placement because I believe she has an S. (-6.0)
>Linda_Hoggatt: GOO I1 GOO +10 43
>Jason: EFINOUV 1G VU. +21 95
#note Didn't know FEUIN(G). (-14.2)
>Linda_Hoggatt: EEMY 5G EME.Y +20 63
#note E's are quickly becoming precious.
>Jason: EFIILNO G7 IF +13 108
#note Didn't like this play; the only way I bingo is if I draw an S or blank, I feel. Maybe an R for column L bingos. Q likes FILO at 6E. (-3.4)
>Linda_Hoggatt: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 63
>Jason: DEILNOS 13C INDOLES +82 190
#note Now it starts to get a little ugly.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?EHLNTU E6 UNHaLTE. +72 135
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?EHLNTU --  -72 63
#note A seven, eight and nine available: LUTHErN, HUNTE(D)Ly and UNH(OS)TiLE.
>Jason: AILNORT E8 TRINO.AL +68 258
#note Easy decision to challenge ... this is my only available bingo other than TRAINLO(AD), which also would've been blocked. Q likes the nine, maybe going for style points. Or blocking the new bingo I gave her along the triple, I learned. (-12.2)
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?EHLNTU 15E .UNT +12 75
#note I now see I also gave her UN(L)ETHaL. Stupid UN- words...
>Jason: AANORVY L8 OVARY +28 286
#note Again held and unchallenged.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?DEHILW M3 WHILED +31 106
#note Linda asked about this rack in the car and then answered her own question: WHIrLED. Then she shorted herself two, counting it as 29.
>Jason: ?ABNRRS 10D R.B +11 297
#note Should've scored instead of fished. BRAS at L1. (-10.5)
>Linda_Hoggatt: GG 5M .GG +5 111
>Jason: ?ANORST O3 OR.ANiST +77 374
#note No trip-trip. sTARNOS(E) at 4C would've been cute. I considered Ne(G)ATORS for the AB(NeGATORS) potential, but determined it wasn't worth sacrificing the three points. This is Q's pick.
>Linda_Hoggatt: Q 7F Q. +11 122
>Jason: AABITTT L2 BAA +25 399
#note Missed four-overlap BI(O)TA at 12C. (-10.1)
>Linda_Hoggatt: LOPP 4D PLOP +20 142
>Jason: ADEITTT 3F DAT.. +16 415
#note (P)ITTA's Q's pick. (-3.7)
>Linda_Hoggatt: IO G11 OI. +3 145
#note Fish? Where's the JXZ?
>Jason: AEFINTT 8A FAIN. +27 442
#note Q likes ENTIA at 2B. (-13.3)
>Linda_Hoggatt: X I5 .X +18 163
>Jason: CEHJTTZ C7 Z.T +23 465
#note T(A)J at B7 kills all bingo lines. (-10.3)
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?CEEIIK 12A ICK +16 179
>Jason: ACEHJT 14A JET +27 492
#note Took a while, but best.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?EEI M12 EIdE +11 190
>Linda_Hoggatt:  (ACH) +16 206
