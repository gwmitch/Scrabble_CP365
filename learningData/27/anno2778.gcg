#note Whoops! HeROINE is one point better. Silly me.

>Carl: BEFIOOT K4 FO.B +31 146
#note I don't see why FIBER 5H does so well. It's within a point of my play, but still.

>Carl: AEEIIMR L11 EM. +20 254
#note I looked really closely at IRE 11J, and it wins the sim. EME is a close second.
>Dave_W: W 2M W.. +14 175
>Carl: AEIILRT M7 TI +13 267
#note I should have thought harder about this move. (N)I(NE) is definitely better. Yes, TI is nine points more, and there are three Ts unseen, but they all give me a bingo, as do most of the remaining tiles. The last E would give me ELATERIUM.
>Dave_W: DIT G5 DIT. +15 190
>Carl: AADEILR F1 RADIALE +71 338
#note That wasn't a happy bingo, but I had to play it.

#note Blocking WAViCLE.
>Carl: ?ACELVW 8A LAEV. +36 447
#note I looked at LAEVO. I looked at WAVE. Yes, the leave after WAVE is a lot better. But look at the bag! Yuck, lots of garbage. even keeping CEL? doesn't guarantee me a bingo, and even if I get it, Dave will probably block. LAEVO is 16 points more and opens up more bingo lanes for me. *Why does Quackle say that WAVE is 20 points better?*
>Dave_W: ADIUX 13B ADI.UX +44 338
>Carl: ?ACGIWY 10C GA.IC +12 459
#note So, how do you maximize points here? The best sequence is six points better than mine.
