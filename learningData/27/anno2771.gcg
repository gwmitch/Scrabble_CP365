#note Take the spot.  Though, this leave is pretty horrible.  There are better plays elsewhere, but he hinted he did have the S, but didn't want to spend it.  Still, BAM N2 is a better option.  Leaves an E, but who knows if he'd try to hook an S to it.
>Glenn_English: LOSTY 3K Y.. +9 83
#note Dunno why he did that.  Maybe he's close.
