>Vera_Bigall: AHINRST 8F TARNISH +78 78
>Jason: AEEEKOW 9F AWEE +28 28
#note Kevin McCarthy had a rough tournament and when he pulled AEOSSST to open vs. Pete, he totally cracked up, putting his head on my shoulder. As for my rack, I should've played AKEE, two rows up. (-5.8)
>Vera_Bigall: EX 10E EX +51 129
#note OK, what's the line on her beating Lakernick's 556 at this point? Any odds, any takers?
>Jason: EEKOOTT 7G TOOK +30 58
#note FWIW, Kevin played SO and after Pete's exchange, drew EI and played EASIEST. As for me, KETO at D10. (-8.6)
>Vera_Bigall: III -III +0 129
>Jason: EEOOQTT -EOOQT +0 58
#note I couldn't resist; I asked Kevin "Did you see that?" He said no, and I said "I played TOOK, and (setting aside TOOQ) drew this."
>Vera_Bigall: ?ADDEEN D7 DEADENs +79 208
#note As Kevin said a couple times during the day: "I picked a bad day to give up amphetamines." Meanwhile, I was waiting for this 24 hours from heck to end mercifully.
>Jason: DEIOTUU L8 .IDEOUT +22 80
#note Ah, yes, the timeless "throw back the Q, draw two U's." May as well go balls-to-the-wall and hope she doesn't have an S. Passing OUU is slightly higher in win percentage, but I gotta score and open.
>Vera_Bigall: AWY C6 WAY +19 227
#note Later in the game, somebody (Linda? me?) called Kevin an "asshole." "Hey!" he responded. "The last person to call me an asshole didn't get a mother's day card for three years!" (Pause.) "Until you realized she was right?" Linda Hoggatt said. Burn! 
>Jason: ADEEGUU 5C AGUE +20 100
#note "Do you want me to draw for you?" Kevin asked, looking at my rack. "Could you?" I asked. "You can't do any worse." Explained Kevin to a puzzled Pete: "I keep looking over and his racks aren't much to look at." I nodded.
>Vera_Bigall: BEIR 14J BI.ER +26 253
#note  I overdrew, co-mingled; Vera looked at CES and ditched the S. I looked at Kevin and said "That wouldn't have happened if you'd drawn for me."
>Jason: CDEFFHU 15F CUFFED +52 152
#note Apparently I can't recognize a hopeless situation when I see it. Considered CHUFFED for 114 ... and it's good. Nooooooooooooo!!! Why not? I'm almost frickin' obligated, even though I wasn't sure of CHUFF and had no idea if it took an -ED. Who knows how the game turns? True, she lets it go and she's up 39 with the case blank (I'm pretty sure she had it by this point given her next three plays) and probably wins, but combine that with my later bingo miss ... whatifs suck.
>Vera_Bigall: JO D3 JO. +22 275
#note Poor Linda. Grob bingo-bango-bongo-irvinged her in round 13. Then, sitting next to me, Judy Horn goes bingo-bango-bongo-irving on her the next round! At least I spaced out my four bingos in our round 11 game. :) Poor Linda.
>Jason: BHLOORU C11 HOUR +23 175
#note Didn't know or see (S)HOOL at K8. (-6.9)
>Vera_Bigall: M 11C ..M +24 299
#note Ruh-roh. And I can't block the juicy -S hook for anything.
>Jason: ABGGLNO B13 BOG +20 195
#note GLOB at B7. Of course, I could run it giving Vera the S or blank, but I'm not using the partial opponent's rack feature unless I know for sure. I probably should go back and re-sim those late plays against Glass giving him an S, but eh. (-6.4)
>Vera_Bigall: ?AEILMN O8 MENIALs +84 383
#note Somebody from the other end of the room starts whistling. "Will whoever's tunelessly whistling please stop?" Kevin says. Pause. "Did I just say that out loud?"
>Jason: AGILNSY B7 LAY +16 211
#note I thought this was cute; good leave, setting up an almost unblockable hook. I hate going through a game without bingoing. G(U)Y at 13K is a little better, though. (-6.6)
>Vera_Bigall: EOV N6 VOE +18 401
>Jason: AGIINSV 10J VI. +15 226
#note Didn't know VISAING. (-49.3)
>Vera_Bigall: N K10 .N +8 409
#note Oh dear, back to this...
>Jason: AAGILNS 15A A. +9 235
#note Knew SIGNAL (PUDGY SWITCHMAN JABS KNAVE) took an A, but not for what. AGNAILS, which goes down at 4F. (-25.2)
>Vera_Bigall: IST 6J SIT +14 423
>Jason: AGILNPS A1 SAPLING +89 324
#note At first an "Oh, crap! It takes the P too but I can't see it!" but I anagrammed it. Worthy of a "nice play" from Vera.
>Vera_Bigall: Q K5 Q. +22 445
>Jason: EIILRRT L2 RELI. +21 345
#note Lamented that 1) I couldn't fish for the out bingo given the pool and 2) everything I saw just gave her a better comeback. When I reached into the bag, I was surprised to draw the Z. Ironically, we discussed the "zed" before our game. Q approves of this play.
>Vera_Bigall: CNOPRST M13 P.C +22 467
#note Surprisingly, she tracked me, said aloud that I had RITZ ... and then didn't block the only out.
>Jason: IRTZ 4F RITZ +16 361
#note I need to learn how to draw better or play better ... preferably both.
>Jason:  (NORST) +10 371
