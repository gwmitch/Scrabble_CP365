#note Not a word I like but I see it easily now.
>mrblacky: ADIKLNR L4 KRAN. +36 36
#note Great move! I forgot the word, that's why...
>twq: EEFRRTY 9B FERRETY +72 124
#note Void for the win! I'd play it in real life too, though.
>mrblacky: AADEILY 10A AY +29 65
>twq: AACNOSU D7 CO.NUA +18 142
#note Was about to play TOUCAN until I saw CORNUA E7, then CORNUA D7. Talk about progressiveness.
>mrblacky: ADEILRU 8D .U +4 69
#note Interesting DERAIL fish and not at all bad. Speedy Player choices of AUDIAL/ AUDILE seem terrible compared to this fish.
>twq: AAHNSVX K8 .AVAH +22 164
#note Crunch move here, which I almost missed - throws clunky H and V, and promises a high scoring X play next turn to possibly counter his bingo. Just what I needed.
>mrblacky: ADEILRS 13A DIALERS +77 146
>twq: BILNOSX L11 BOLIX +58 222
#note I pick this over XI because I like the leave and score better. I'm not bothered about him scoring with the X.
>mrblacky: EEIOOQT 15K O.O +10 156
>twq: BEEINPS M12 BI +20 242
#note Interesting move here though I think I could have done better with BE M11 - DEB A13 and BE 7I are to me inferior. DEB opens a line which is not immediately useful to me (B and P don't go very well in bingos) and BE 7I doesn't do much to help my defense, instead leaving the M 11-15 line open. I don't rate EENPS much lower than EINPS so there.
>mrblacky: AEEIQTT 11C Q.ATE +28 184
#note No idea why everyone prefers Os to As and Is to As. What's wrong with the A?
>twq: EEGNPSW 10F WE +30 272
#note Err... played this too quickly but yes NEW 10D scores 2 more points.
>mrblacky: EIIIRTU -IIU +0 184
#note Speedy Player recommends DUI here over the exchange. I'm having my doubts.
>twq: EGINOPS 5E SPONGIE. +94 366
#note Great play yields great luck.
>mrblacky: EEGIRRT H1 ERRI.G +24 208
#note REIGN is better - Speedy Player rates GREIN higher too.
>twq: ?ACDENU 1A AUDiENC. +80 446
#note N8 UNCAsED scores more but I was too engrossed with the E. Doesn't matter much anyway.
>mrblacky: EEGLTUV 4B VELE +16 224
#note urp
>twq: EHIMNTW 2A WHIN +39 485
#note WHITE or WHITEN 14J are quite dangerous, but WHITE is probably justifiable - I didn't see BI(T)O till later though. WHIN/ WHIT is fine by me because I need to keep the E. Quackle seems to prefer MN to MT by about 1 point though.
>mrblacky: ADGOTTU A10 .OU.AD +27 251
>twq: DEJMNST N10 JEST +39 524
#note Seems obviously best, especially since it leaves 1.
>mrblacky: FGIPSTT 6H .IF +31 282
#note No hope of him bingoing, so he has to score. He misses the all-important BI(T)O/(JEST)S hook though.
>twq: DEIMNOO O8 DOOM +34 558
#note But so do I! I forget that he can score trillions there so I avoid DOMINO as it opens the TLS.
>mrblacky: ?GPSTT B12 P.G +22 304
