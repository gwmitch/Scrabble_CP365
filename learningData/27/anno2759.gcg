>Nigel_Peltier: FGOR 8F FROG +16 16
>Jason: AABCMNT 7H BAM +16 16
#note Q likes TAMBAC, same spot. (-3.2)
>Nigel_Peltier: AEPSSTU 6E PETASUS +78 94
>Jason: ACFINTU 5J CUIF +29 45
#note Q likes the 7C placement better, even though it scores four less. (-2.2)
>Nigel_Peltier: EIMN 4L MIEN +27 121
>Jason: AGNOOTY O1 GOO.Y +27 72
#note This or (N)ONGAY. (-0.1)
>Nigel_Peltier: ?ADEINW 1H DEWAxIN. +86 207
#note Only bingo. "How often does the only bingo involve making the blank an X?" I wondered. At least twice: In Chicago, Mark Kenas' only playable bingo with ?AILORU was UxORIAL. Given my rack, I'm already half-writing this one off to the fates.
>Jason: AAEINTU 2J EAU +15 87
#note Yeah, down 120 through four against an 1800 player, I'm reminding myself to not get stubborn and ruin spread in round 1.
>Nigel_Peltier: K M3 K.. +20 227
>Jason: AEEILNT 2B LINEATE +71 158
#note Well, maybe I can still make this respectable...
>Nigel_Peltier: ILT 7D TIL +13 240
>Jason: ?BEGILN B2 .IBELiNG +62 220
#note Missing (T)aNGIBLE (how???) and (T)rEBLING, but hold the phone! I'm back in this puppy! (-10.2)
>Nigel_Peltier: IQ A7 QI +49 289
#note *sigh* This was just one of those "Sisyphus games."
>Jason: DNNRVWZ 3A Z.N +28 248
#note Can't remember if I went horizontal or vertical. I'll give myself the benefit of the doubt and assume I made the Q-approved play.
>Nigel_Peltier: CRT F1 C.RT +6 295
>Jason: DDHNRVW -DHRVW +0 248
#note One of the perils of annotating games a year later: Trying to read your handwriting. Assuming this is my rack, Q likes V(E)ND at 5A. (-4.9)
>Nigel_Peltier: EILORST D7 .RIOLETS +68 363
>Jason: DEHJNOP 14B JO.HED +38 286
#note Don't tell Mallick, Dackman, etc. (and especially Bowman, given his CGP signature) what I missed in the same spot. :) (-9.2)
>Nigel_Peltier: HOW 15F HOW +35 398
>Jason: DENOPRU 13G UNROPED +79 365
#note Now, I know the rack. Then, I was taking a chance and was relieved it was un-held. I ain't dead yet! If he leaves the X-bomb open...
>Nigel_Peltier: DIT 14J DIT +21 419
#note Yeah, knew he'd be too smart for that.
>Jason: AAERVXY 12L VARY +43 408
#note Best.
>Nigel_Peltier: AAEORSV O7 SAVOR. +36 455
#note I thought this was his play, too. Missing the tough-to-spot goofy word SOAVE at 15K; four better.
>Jason: AEX 11B AX.E +22 430
