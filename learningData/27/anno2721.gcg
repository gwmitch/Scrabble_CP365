>Jason: ADDEENT 8D DATED +18 18
#note Q likes ED, clearly. I dunno, it seems that I fish with that type of rack, miss, fish a couple more turns, my opponent gets ??SSS to my S and I look at my scoresheet going "Well, my turnover was pretty sucky; maybe I'm partly to blame." (-2.6)
>Harriette_Lakernick: BELOW 7G BOWL +26 26
#note Played BOWEL at 7E before seeing it made OT*. "OK, I'm tired," she said. I was feeling semi-decently about my chances at this point.
>Jason: AEGNTTT 9G TAT +15 33
#note Q says TET is better, as AGNT is a better leave than EGNT. Weird. (-1.0)
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINRSTV K7 STRIVEN +80 106
>Jason: CEEGINT E8 .GENETIC +72 105
>Harriette_Lakernick: AEMO 15E .AMEO +27 133
>Jason: AIOPUUV J4 UVU.A +12 117
#note Story of my tourney: Everywhere, vowels by bonus squares just waiting for a cheap 30-point play and I draw UUV and three other vowels. Although this did get a "nice dump" from Harriette. Best, but I probably should've considered exchanging.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AFN F10 FAN +31 164
>Jason: EIOOPUY D12 YUP +34 151
#note Best, but P(T)OOEY/(FAN)O is pretty sweet.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EEEILRS 5E RELIE.ES +94 258
>Jason: EIIOOOQ -IIOOOQ +0 151
#note OK, a lot of my bingos are baby bingos because I refuse to break up some good leaves, but this is why. Draw into a leave like EIOO and out comes IOQ. Best exchange, but my win percentage is around 2.1 while having done literally nothing wrong.
>Harriette_Lakernick: FOX J12 FOX +36 294
>Jason: CEEHINR L12 HE +31 182
#note Ducky says keep going with HEIR, HERE or HERN; take the points and regardless of who hits the triple, it opens a line I desperately need. (-7.7)
>Harriette_Lakernick: HOW 4D HOW +25 319
#note She said she considered NOSHOWS* here, but I don't know what the blank would've been.
>Jason: CEINPRR C11 REC +27 209
#note D'oh! Saw the PRE-DATED possibility when I played DATED, but forgot about it here. Even better is PR(U)NER at 4H. Need to score and open. (-14.6)
>Harriette_Lakernick: KS 10J K.S +17 336
>Jason: EEIJNPR L2 JIN. +22 231
#note JEEP(S). I didn't feel like I'd mentally checked out by this point, but maybe I had. (-15.7)
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?INORRS 3B IRONeRS +77 413
#note Only bingo. Nice fit.
>Jason: AEGILPR 2B LAP +24 255
#note (J)IG's the best valuation play. Missed GRA(DATED) as well as PRE(DATED). (-10.9)
>Harriette_Lakernick: IM H1 MI. +15 428
>Jason: EEGIQRZ 13I Z...R +48 303
#note RE(J)IG is allegedly way better and search me as to why. (-19.5)
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?DILOTU N7 TOLUIDs +73 501
>Jason: EEGGINQ 7C QI +24 327
>Harriette_Lakernick: AAADIOY O8 YA +32 533
#note ODA at M2 guarantees the big Y play next turn.
>Jason: BEEGGNO M1 BONE +27 354
#note GONE is 10 better; threatens the out. Find your best play, find a better one; c'mon. Frustration's no excuse.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AADIO 1M .OA +15 548
#note Best.
>Jason: EGG 2H .GG +9 363
#note Missed (FAN)EG(A) at F10, which I didn't play for about a dozen reasons. (-10.0)
>Harriette_Lakernick: ADI B1 I..AD +6 554
#note Nice. Didn't think she had an out.
>Harriette_Lakernick:  (E) +2 556
