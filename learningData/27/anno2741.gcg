>Marcus: DIV 8G VID +14 14
>Me: EHLNRTW J6 WHEN +26 26
#note WHEN is less open than THREW, yet it loses by 3 whole points. Frankly, I didn't see THREW.
>Marcus: BCEIIOO I5 BOO.IE +25 39
#note He said he kept IC. Good move!
>Me: ?ALNRTZ H4 ZA +25 51
#note TaRZAN/TARZaN H1 wins, TZAR is third, but I missed all those. A whole host of moves come in between and ZA loses 29 equity points.
>Marcus: CEIV K3 VICE +24 63
>Me: ?ACLNRT 5G C.. +7 58
#note CoLZA wins. TINCAL CITRAL RICTAL 4J eluded me when I looked at the open I. LAB beats CAB by 4 points but they're both at the bottom.
>Marcus: DDO H7 D.DO +19 82
>Me: ?ADLNRT K9 TRoLAND +69 127
#note I simmed just to make sure it wins.
>Marcus: OSX L11 SOX +34 116
>Me: AEEEILR M13 EE +24 151
#note I thought EE impulsive but it IS the best move. I figured since I had the L, I'd be able to use AXEL. Furthermore, if the AXEL or AXES hook is used, I'd counter by taking row 15 or column O. AEILR is a good leave for me.
>Marcus: ALSUW N10 WAULS +47 163
>Me: AEIILRR O5 LAIRIER +78 229
#note Turns out Marcus gave me the spot.
>Marcus: EFH N4 FEH +32 195
>Me: EEGIKPT 15G PIKE. +36 265
#note Best.
>Marcus: ABI H1 BAI.. +48 243
#note I was expecting this.
>Me: AEGGOTU M3 TOGAE +29 294
#note I was extremely unsure, but this move is the best.
>Marcus: AEEGNUY I13 YU. +14 257
#note Strange move.
>Me: ?EGQRTU 2F QU.G +34 328
#note Who knew TRUCAGE = TRUQUAGE? QUAG is best nonbingo, losing 14.5 equity. TRUQUAGE is my first miss of the tourney, not counting HORNFULS in game 2.
>Marcus: INNO 3C NONI +19 276
#note He was deliberating between NO 12H and NONI. Opening is correct.
>Me: ?ERSTTY F9 YiTTERS +74 402
#note TRYSTES, SNOTTERY, YATTERS, TETRYLS are the bingos I had. I chose YITTERS over YATTERS, which I thought was a phony. I wanted to play STY O13 (which loses less equity than some bingos, including the one I played).
>Marcus: AEGNRTU D3 .UTRANGE +70 346
#note This was the crunch move. Marcus made a mistake by flashing all his tiles. I vaguely knew BURGANET when he made BURGEANT*, but I couldn't say anything about it because it's his move. I told him I would challenge BURGEANT* off since I didn't know it, and after a while, Marcus decided on OUTRANGE. Hmm what if I had told him about BURGANET?
>Me: AAFLRST 10C F. +5 407
#note I wasn't sure if Marcus had a bingo with the unseen tiles, so I randomly/impulsively stuck an F there. I noticed the 12th and 1st rows were open only later. I considered FE a fish for myself, actually, but I didn't think of the possible bingos I had with B or T. FE loses close to 27 EQ.
>Marcus: JO C7 JO +36 382
>Me: AAELRST 11B RESA. +25 432
#note EASTERLY is a cool move but isn't optimal. FALTER is best, followed by NORM from Marcus, then AS J2 to go out.
>Marcus: IMMNOP 13C MOP. +16 398
#note MOPE, OPINE or MOME would do, all giving 34 points in two turns.
>Me: ALT H12 LA +8 440
#note TUAN 14H.
>Marcus: IMN 14B NIM +18 416
>Marcus:  (T) +2 418
