#note I figured this play was decent defensively on account of the V, but ZOSTER takes an S and both blanks are unseen, so it's not like I really shut anything down here. I should have just gone for more points here. Quackle prefers VIS N10? A lot of plays are close here... -2

#note Maybe I'm worrying too much about defense here? I like shutting down this lane, but VANITY G6 (which I missed completely) scores way, way more. Also just VITA C7 would be better probably, just to balance the rack more, and QI isn't really all that defensive anyway, since Jason still has the S hook option.  I suck, I guess. -14

>Jason: ADEFITU C9 EF +15 291
#note Missing UNFED G7. We both suck at seeing that spot. IF is interesting because it creates a better bingo lane for Jason, who's still down 35. Why he played EF instead, though, is a mystery.
>Evans: AAEERTT 13K A.E +19 345
>Jason: ?ADITUU K1 U.U +3 294
#note UNIT G7 cleans up the rack a little bit and scores decently, so it's probably best.
>Evans: AEEORTT N13 ET +11 356
#note I missed ORE 13A, forming COAX and scoring a shitton# of points. ONE G7 is also interesting, since it opens a third bingo lane, which I'm likely to use, keeping TATER.
>Jason: ?ADEIIT 4L A.ID +20 314
#note DIABETIC, which would have been a really awesome find. AVID looks second-best.
