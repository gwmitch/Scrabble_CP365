>Me: ?CEINNO 9F CONIiNE +74 74
#note Bad positioning. 9D does the job fine.

#note CYTOID is best. I wonder why I didn't see it. YCLED 5E is not too bad either. STYLOID earned a challenge.

#note Blocked my CURARINE. Gah.

>Me: AEEIORT C3 EA +13 181
#note AINE E5 is the better fish.

#note Missing EROTIZE M2.
>Marlon: ADQ E10 QAD. +28 197
>Me: AAFIORS D11 FO.A +25 240
#note Like I expected, FARO sims best. When I played FORA, I forgot about the 2 unseen Ms and was punished. This is the beginning of my downfall.
>Marlon: GLMO 15A GLOM +43 240
>Me: AIPRRSW B1 WARP +29 269
#note I didn't know RIPSAW 2A. WARP is 2nd best, losing 1 equity. I thought of using DEFIS by playing SPAW, but that sims lower than WARP by 4 points. So I was right to play WARP.

>Me: BEELRST N2 TREBLE.S +74 371
>Me: BEELRST --  -74 297
#note I wanted to just play BELTER, which is the best move, but since DOUBLER is good, I thought I might as well try. TRIPLER* isn't good either. This is my only challenged phony of the tournament.
>Marlon: EX N12 .XE +33 345
>Me: BEELRST M7 B.S. +20 317
#note I thought the S didn't have value. To me, it's either BERES N6 or BEST, and I was right in choosing BEST. BERES is 10 behind BEST, but both sim poorly. BLET 6G is best, though I didn't know BOHO.
>Marlon: AANT A1 ANTA +46 391
#note I challenged TRET.
>Me: EEGILRT 2A ..T. +7 324
#note I thought I wouldn't need the S, so I fished a T at that spot. It sims 2nd best behind ILK, losing 5.5 equity. I wanted to play ILK but....that'd leave me with 6 tiles and unable to bingo. I forgot that I could probably go out with EEGRT and something to catch JVW.
>Marlon: DELW 14J WELD.. +18 409
>Me: EEGILRS A12 GRI. +8 332
#note Let's see. Champ took a while with this one, and I have a 50% chance of winning with ER 15J. That is not the optimal. I've come up with a sequence that loses by 11. Anyway, I didn't bother because I was low on time.
