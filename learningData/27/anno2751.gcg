>Dave: AEEGLNN 8H EN +4 4
#note Clear to preserve the potent ANGEL stem. NE is possibly even stronger for increased hookability.
>Joel: ADEEGTU 7G GAUD +14 14
#note Smart move, given the inferences from the opening play. This rates to make it much more difficult for opponent to bingo than the alternative of GUDE. 
>Dave: ADEGLNT 6I TANGLED +71 75
>Joel: ACEEEIT O6 .EICE +24 38
#note This seems to be giving up too much for the sake of leave. CADET scores an additional 9 points and doesn't open the N10 hotspot.
>Dave: AAAILTY N10 YA +26 101
#note Or ALIYA.
>Joel: AEOPRST 12I SEAPORT +76 114
#note Sacrificing 4 points to avoid opening the triple (with a play at M8). 
>Dave: AAAILOT L2 OTAL.IA +18 119
#note LAOGAI sims slightly higher.
>Joel: IIMOORS 11H ROOM +24 138
#note Missed MOIRAI K8.
>Dave: AEHIORS 3E HOARIES. +63 182
>Joel: AEHIILS 2J HA. +29 167
#note Bad miss. HAOLE is clearly best.
>Dave: CIIKOVW H1 WO.K +48 230
>Joel: EIIILNS E3 .ILI +14 181
#note Fine - this aims at a quick bingo to get back in the game. NISEI 13K is another option.
>Dave: CFIITUV F5 IF +28 258
>Joel: EEEINOS 13K NEE +19 200
#note SEINE 13J sims best.
>Dave: ACINTUV 14F VICUNA +27 285
#note Either this or VAC 14J - both plays accomplish about the same thing, but the additional turnover gives VICUNA the edge.
>Joel: DEFIOSZ 15K SIZED +55 255
>Dave: DJRTTUV N2 JUTT.D +31 316
>Joel: BEFMOWY O1 YOM +37 292
>Dave: GIOQRRV 10E GIRO +9 325
#note With the lead slipping away and both blanks still out, it seems right to try to block the board (QI can wait). However, VIG G9 blocks almost as effectively and scores another 10 points, which could be very useful. 
>Joel: BEFLSWX G13 F.X +17 309
#note Prospects are not good. WEB M8 is a possibility, but with vowels so scarce, something else is called for.
>Dave: ?EQRRTV 4D Q. +22 347
>Joel: ?BELSUW H13 E.U +47 356
#note Perfect draw! Following through on the plan of the previous turn.
>Dave: ?ENRRTV J10 V.. +14 361
>Joel: ?BLNPSW K1 W..P +13 369
#note Heartbreaking draw this time. PHEW J1 is actually better, to block the 25% chance of BEsTREWN.
>Dave: ?EENRRT 8K R.N +3 364
#note Best, as far as I can tell.
>Joel: ?BBLNS 5E ..BS +18 387
#note BLaB 9C saves 4 points.
>Dave: ?EERT 2B EREcT +23 387
>Dave:  (BLN?) +10 397
