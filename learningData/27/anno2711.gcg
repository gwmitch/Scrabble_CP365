>Stephen_Knapp: CEOTUX 8G COX +24 24
#note Knowing my lack of fives knowledge, Steve later said he considered trying CUTEX*. "I'm glad this game is next to the directors' table," George said before we started. Indeed. :)
>Jason: AEILORU J6 URAEI +22 22
#note Earning an "ooh" from Knappster.
>Stephen_Knapp: EE 7I E.E +14 38
#note "This is a shocker," Knappster said.  The guy's been averaging about three E's in our recent games. :)
>Jason: AGLNNOU 6I L.AU +16 38
#note Didn't know GUNN(E)L at K3 and misssed the -L hook to COXA anyway. (-9.2)
>Stephen_Knapp: FIU G6 FU.I +11 49
#note When I saw FUC, I thought "Oh, there'll be a comment coming ... oh, the I." :)
>Jason: GMNNORV K3 NOV.. +16 54
#note Q likes NOM at F5. (-2.3)
>Stephen_Knapp: AEOTZ 3I ZO.ATE +50 99
>Jason: GMNNRRS L1 GR.M +26 80
#note Wasn't it just a couple minutes ago I had AEILORU? This, GNAR, and GRAN sim neck-and-neck.
>Stephen_Knapp: ARWY N2 W.ARY +38 137
>Jason: NNNNRST -NNNT +0 80
#note "Want some N's?" I asked, turning the four over. Q likes keeping RST by a bit. (-0.9)
>Stephen_Knapp: EFS O1 FES +39 176
>Stephen_Knapp: EFS --  -39 137
#note About this point, someone's cell phone went off. I offered to dance to the music to the challenge computer. "Well, aren't you cocky?" Knappster said. At lunch, Knappster said: "He hasn't even held in years, now he's challenging!" It hurts because it's true. :)
>Jason: DINQRRS F9 QI +24 104
#note Wasn't sure if this or I10 was the right placement. Q suggests 5H, which I missed. (-0.6)
>Stephen_Knapp: EEFJS 11B JEFES +42 179
#note Owie. Not even a "you're welcome."
>Jason: DKLNRRS C10 K.RN +16 120
#note Ever since LUAU: 14 consonants picked, one vowel. But I'm still not in terrible shape. Q likes K(O)R at J2, although I don't know if I can stomach drawing into DLNRS given recent history. (-4.9)
>Stephen_Knapp: DGO O1 GOD +37 216
>Jason: AADELRS 12C .AD +21 141
#note AAE into DLRS. OK, maybe K(O)R was best. But, more importantly, maybe I can start turning this puppy around. A toss-up between this and the beautiful A(F)EARD at D10.
>Stephen_Knapp: ?ACINTU O6 AUCTIoN +82 298
#note "I'll proceed with caution here," Knappster said as he put this down. Har har.
>Jason: ?AEILRS 13I ALInERS +73 214
#note "Hold," Knappster said as I hit the clock and laughed. "It's hard to impress anybody with SERIAL-blank!" I said. "Don't worry, you haven't impressed me since I met you," Kevin McCarthy said. I think he'll fit in to the Midwest nicely... Q seems to like taking the two extra points along row 14, but it's close. (-3.3)
>Stephen_Knapp: DEIV F3 DIVE +17 315
#note "Well, you've got a chance at biggest comeback, and you're playing the right guy for the job," Knappster said. Beat me to it.
>Jason: EHIMNNT N10 HM +31 245
#note My only real case of FPS in the tourney. I considered THEMIN(G) at 1F for 39, but after DIVE, I'm killing that area/hope of -ING bingos. However, with four O's out, I need to be concerned about him whacking me with an H1 play which kills -ING bingos. Still, this is second in win %, about 3.5 to 2.5. I found it humorous that my rack was THINMEN. (-14.3)
>Stephen_Knapp: HPT 4E P.TH +13 328
#note After Knappster confirmed the score, I clapped my hands on my jeans. "I hear 'em," Knappster said, referring to my footsteps. After this play, he commented "now I'm like you."
>Jason: BEIINNT 12K BIN +18 263
#note This is best in win %? Shortly after I saw BIN at 14I, which I like better; opens another lane while keeping -ING bingos open. BITIN(G) is highest in valuation, though I really don't fancy my chances of outrunning. (-5.0)
>Stephen_Knapp: ALNO 1H ALON. +18 346
#note "If he's playing off IN, that's not a good sign," Knappster said. Aren't 1400s not supposed to think that way? Knappster's now a deserving 1500s, though, and in the same class as Winter. Good play.
>Jason: EEINOOT H3 O.O +24 287
#note Held briefly and released.
>Stephen_Knapp: BGPWY -BGPWY +0 346
#note Knappster passed five; I assume ugly consonants.
>Jason: EEEIINT I1 .E. +12 299
#note Well, good news bad news. Good news: Knappster just scored zero. Bad news: the bag is now 5/8 his rejects. Fishing for the S for SIENITE. The R for NITERIE might work, too. Q likes TIE at 14A ... it is the time to be ballsy. (-11.8)
>Stephen_Knapp: ADERSSY 14B READY +43 389
#note "I'm going to do the stupidest thing I've done all tournament," Knappster said. After his play, I said "Doesn't look stupid from here." Championship Player likes DRESSY, though; says it's a guaranteed win.
>Jason: EEIINTT 5H .I +13 312
#note Knappster complimented the play, but little does he know I don't see an available tile to give me a playable bingo. Q says there are available wins (by drawing the O maybe?), but I don't see them. TI at 14I is a better spread limiter, Q says, but I disagree with that, too. (-2.0)
>Stephen_Knapp: BSW I11 SW.B +9 398
>Jason: EEINPTT M8 TIP +14 326
#note CP's pick of EN(DIVE) appears nine better. "I feel like I'm playing better in my losses than in my wins," I said after the game. "Is this supposed to be a case in point?" he asked. Yes, actually, and Q agrees.
>Stephen_Knapp: GLOST 15G LOST +22 420
#note Best, shockingly. :)
>Jason: EENT 14I .EN +17 343
#note Best. This, BET, or NEE, which reduces our score. In a situation like that, I always go for the highest-scoring play/counterplay. Gotta keep that scoring average up. :) Carol asked how it ended up. "I got outdrawn," I said. "See, now I thought it was an even draw," Knappster said and laughed. At lunch he called it a "golden draw" for me, and when he saw my opponents' 556-467-493 afternoon, he said "See? It was a golden draw for you!" Stinker...
>Stephen_Knapp: G D14 .G +5 425
>Stephen_Knapp:  (ET) +4 429
