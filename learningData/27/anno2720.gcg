>Jason: OOW 8G WOO +12 12
#note He's left off the T!
>Steve_: EIIJNNX 7I JINNI +38 38
#note Thought briefly about holding on to the -NI on the end, but it's best to play them off since this makes it more likely to cash in with the spider at J6, and it also doesn't give up any easy -s hooks.
>Jason: EGILU 9I GUILE +22 34
>Steve_: AEIOOOX 6J XI +52 90
#note Yeah, but what do I do next?
>Jason: BOT 5K BOT +20 54
>Steve_: AEIOOOQ -AEIOOOQ +0 90
#note Probably a good thing to draw the Q, since I'm passing this turn anyway.
>Jason: ADDU 4L DUAD +24 78
>Steve_: DDELSTY O1 TED.Y +30 120
>Jason: IMPR 2K PRIM. +18 96
>Steve_: DEFHLLS 10F FLESH +52 172
>Jason: EHT H10 .TH +10 106
>Steve_: DEILOQR 12H .OLDER +20 192
#note Normally, it would be right to play QI at 9E. But Jason could have a bingo on his rack, given the fishing play on the last turn. This makes it much tougher for him to get something down.
>Jason: ?AARSTT 13B TArTARS +71 177
#note OK, so maybe I was wrong.
>Steve_: EEEGIOQ 11C OGEE +15 207
#note The right idea. No rush to dump the monster as a spot is still guaranteed to be there next time. Plus. . .
>Jason: AEOR 12A AERO +21 198
#note I might get lucky and draw a U.
>Steve_: EFINOQU 1H FIQUE +61 268
>Jason: GI M12 .IG +8 206
#note A key play as you'll soon see. It looks to me like Jason is setting up a juicy hook for himself. Why look at all those A's that are left. A's, you say?
>Steve_: ?AENORU 15I OUtEARN +76 344
#note I saw ARENOUs, but wanted him to know I also knew the A hook, and he wasn't going to be able to go there. Jason holds but doesn't challenge, and I catch a break.
>Jason: CEILPSS 2C SPLICES +70 276
#note Would've been worth a tad bit more on row 15. I'll let you do the math.
>Steve_: ACMNRTY 14D MAY +37 381
#note Duck likes (S)MARTY.
>Jason: AOZ 1A ZOA +38 314
>Steve_: ACEINRT C1 ..CERTAIN +76 457
#note Not too hard of a find, if you've already been looking for a place to play CERTAIN. Quackle certainly isn't impressed with nines, and plays CLARINET instead.
>Jason: BEKNVVW 4A KN.W +32 346
>Steve_: AN 11K AN +12 469
#note And the 2008 tournament year comes to an end!
