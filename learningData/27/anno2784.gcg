#note The highest scoring bingo.
>Dave: AEIOPRV K5 PE.ORIA +36 40
>Phil: ACGINPR 12F CARPING +86 150
#note The dynamic choice.  CRAPING is safer but less fun.
>Dave: EMOOTUV 6A OUTMOVE +75 115
#note After PELORIA, I remarked how annoying it is when you've got to make a play that keeps your worst tile.  Then I made this ridiculous six tile draw.
>Phil: DEHINR E5 H.RDEIN +44 194
>Dave: CDEGGNU A5 C.GGED +33 148
#note DUGONG is an interesting alternative.

#note Doh!  Missed TURBINAL.

>Dave: EIMNQST L4 QI +26 269
#note I preferred dumping the Q first to cashing in ZEST or ESCARPING right away.  The duck agrees.  In our postgame discussion, it came out that Phil and I both had the ESCARPING and CARPINGS extensions in the forefront of our minds for the entire game.
>Phil: EFI M3 FIE +28 300
>Dave: EMNSSTY M10 .ESTY +47 316
#note I was so happy to draw the Y that I quickly threw down ZESTY and never even saw MESSY for 12 more points.  It's definitely a mistake to pass that up, but not a huge one, as keeping the other S may still allow me to play for a good score on column N.

>Dave: AKMNSSX 14E AXM.N +30 346
#note Before his move, I was all set to play MIX, but now I had the opportunity to score a couple more points and clear out more consonants.  Sure, there was risk in exposing 15A-E plays, but there was also risk in leaving open the bingo lines.  I figured with the score this close I needed all the points I could get, and the S's might help me hit 15A first.
>Phil: ADEFR 15A FARED +33 360
#note After the game Phil told me his leave was AB.  He took some time before choosing this over FARAD.  I didn't analyze it deeply, but intuitively I slightly preferred FARAD, though the difference is very small.
>Dave: AIJKNSS 13A JINKS +36 382
#note During the game I felt this move *had* to be right.  Although it's not ideal to go into a 5 vs. 7 endgame where he's almost sure to go out first, I'm likely to score enough on this play and the next one to outrun him.  The duck thinks this wins 67% of the time.  Nothing else is above 55%.
>Phil: ABEILOO I2 BAILO. +9 369
#note Phil had a tough tile draw here and was very short of time.  He saw BOOK, but couldn't find an outplay.  However, he missed the new word EBOOK, which is his best play.  I would still win comfortably.
