>moh: ADDEFLR 8D FLARED +28 28
#note Without any really strong leaves available, it's best just to play for points and tile turnover. FARDED is a little better than my play since it scores 2 more points with similar leave values (a lone D versus an L).
>ccree: ACDTT H4 CATT.D +12 12
>moh: ADOOORT D8 .ORDO +18 46
#note There's nothing spectacular available. Getting rid of two Os while scoring decently makes this a pretty easy decision.
>ccree: GHPR F6 GR.PH +23 35
>moh: AEEILOT G6 AE.O +21 67
#note My plans for E(T)IOLATE were foiled by his play. After an all-vowel draw, getting rid of vowels is my first priority. I prefer to keep the flexible EILT combo, although there are a couple of plays that turned over more tiles and scored about as well. They are C9 TOILE 22 and G7 A(R)EOLE 24. The huge drawback to AREOLE is that it slots an E at G12, which offers way too many easy points to an opponent who holds a heavy consonant like H or F.
>ccree: EJW C12 JEW +35 70
>moh: EILPSTW 15C SWIPLE +59 126
#note Sometimes the key to finding the best play is just knowing an obscure word. Luckily, I happened to know this one.
>ccree: DIINV 5H .VIDIN +20 90
>moh: ABEGNTU 4J TABU +27 153
#note The board doesn't offer many openings other than overlapping above AVIDIN, and most of the options take advantage of that spot. 4L BUNG, 4L BUG, 4K ABUT, etc., make use of this spot. The best option is TABU, which maximizes score and keeps the decent EGN.
>ccree: RTUY 14H YURT +14 104
>moh: AEFGKNO L11 KENAF +40 193
#note While 3K FOG 34 and 3K GONEF 34 are reasonable, I prefer KENAF. Since GONEF opens up a 3x3 lane, it's pretty easy to rule that out in favor of similar-scoring plays. That leaves the choice to FOG vs. KENAF. Honestly, it's very close. While KENAF scores six more points, FOG keeps a better leave and avoids exposing the 15O 3W. The computer sim gives KENAF a slight edge. 
>ccree: EO E11 OE +20 124
>moh: BGIOVXY 15L .OXY +51 244
#note FOXY's leave is really clunky, but I'm willing to take a bad leave in exchange for a 120-point lead. There's a decent case for 3K GOBY 40, which keeps the stronger IVX leave, but taking the points is fine here. It might sound crazy that I would even consider GOBY, but consider this: I'm very likely going to score well next turn if I keep the X (either by hitting 15O or 13I), but if I play FOXY I will very often struggle to score next play with the VGB triplet.
>ccree: ORU N12 ROU. +22 146
>moh: BGIIITV 11J TI.I +16 260
#note It's pretty close between 10B BI(R)T(H) 19, 14F GIB 15, and 11J TI(K)I 16. We basically have to choose between a clunky, consonant-heavy leave (BGIV) and keeping doubled Is. They're pretty equally undesireable. One might even be tempted to exchange here, but it's usually best to play through clunky racks when you're ahead.
>ccree: EEIMSSS 3B SEMESIS +80 226
>moh: BCGGIQV 10M QI +24 284
#note SEMESIS* is a phony. I thought it looked odd, but I wasn't sure, and I liked my chances if I just let it go and kept scoring. Obviously, it's a mistake to let the phony go, but I was just too unsure. I considered exchanging on this rack, which is just  horrible. However, I can score with the Q now and hope with a good draw. If I don't get that draw, I can always exchange next play. 2A QI scores a little better than my placement, but I prefer not to open up row 1 (and with no esses in the bag, he can only hook my play with a blank).
>ccree: ?AAMNNO B3 .ONArMAN +63 289
>moh: ?ABCGGV A8 AB +28 312
#note With two consecutive bingos, this game has turned on a dime. The game is effectively tied, so I decided that if I kill the only hot spot (at 8A), and then use my blank to hook QIS next turn, I should be able to outrun the opponent.
>ccree: EEH D1 HE.E +26 315
>moh: ?CEGGVZ 6A V.C +8 320
#note I missed 6J CoZ 47. That's clearly the best play. I became fixated on winning by playing my Z along column O (most likely ZIGs or ZAGs). V(A)C wins about 68% of the time, whereas COZ wins about 75%. That's a pretty big mistake this late.
>ccree: AENRTU 1D .AUNTER +30 345
>moh: ?EGGLNZ K4 ..Z +13 333
#note It's very important in a close game to be the one who uses all their tiles and ends the game. Here I had to make sure he had no way to use all of his tiles (if he had, I would have been obliged to block his out play). He had no way to out out next play, so I can guarantee the win by setting up an out-in-two. BI(Z) guarantees the win.
>ccree: IILO 10I OIL +11 356
>moh: ?EGGLN 2I LEGGiN +24 357
#note Either out play will do (LEGONG was the other out).
