#note VEXT is really close.

#note I do not particularly understand why KEPT wins the sim, but it's apparently pretty significant. (-4.0)

>Tunnicliffe: AEGRTTV 2J V.RGA +34 136
#note VITTA is just a miss. It's definitely better. (-1.7)

>Tunnicliffe: EENSSTT D5 .....S +20 156
#note I knew I was overvaluing NSTTEE, but I just couldn't bring myself to play NEST. That's my problem, I guess. Too many of my decisions are based on intuition. Intuitively, it doesn't seem right to play off NSTE for 26 points, but obviously this situation called for it. Need to use more logic and less gut. (-5.3)

#note FEET sims better. (-1.4)
>Hildebrand: ?ADHLRU 5I HU. +18 177
#note This is only a little worse than HAULYARD.
>Tunnicliffe: ACEENST 6C C.. +5 179
#note lol, wow, I thought this play was pretty okay. I think I remember playing it really fast, which I shouldn't have done. The leave on the board is not that strong, and WEANS and ASCENT are a lot of points to pass up. EXEC is very nice, too. Anyways, bad play. (-21.0)
>Hildebrand: ?ADHLRR N1 H.RD +8 185
#note Check out the score after 7 turns. Hard to believe considering the final score.

#note Alright, so I wasn't looking too hard here, but M7 JITNEY is sweet. O4 ENJOY should have been obvious. (-10.1)
