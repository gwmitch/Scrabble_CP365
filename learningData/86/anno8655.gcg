>Kenji_Matsumoto: IORSTUW -W +0 0
#note It is important to go through each tile whenever you have a rack with any bingo potential.  While IORSTU does not initially look like a strong bingo rack, it forms a 7 letter word with A, C, E, G, K, L, M, N, O, Q, S, T,  as well as forming many 8s.
>Evil_Kenji: BDEINTV -BV +0 0
#note In response to an exchange 1, playing VIBE or VINED is impractical.  Since your opponent is likely to play a bingo, your DEINT gains value since you will have 7 open tiles to play through.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: HIORSTU 8H UH +10 10
#note Since your opponent has traded 2, he/she probably has a strong rack.  IORST is a strong leave, while UH scores 10 points and doesn't give your opponent too much to play a bingo with.
>Evil_Kenji: ADEILNT 8G D.. +7 7
#note With no bingo available, you don't want to make it any easier for your opponent to play a bingo.  This play maximizes your chance of playing a bingo while minimizing your opponent's chances.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEIORST I4 ISOT.ERE +63 73
#note You'd like to look for a bingo that best gives you a scoring spot to use after a likely opponent's bingo.  ISOTHERE creates scoring spots that you will get to use better than your opponent after their one-tile play.
>Evil_Kenji: AEILNTT H1 TENAIL +28 35
#note Again, you have missed a bingo.  While you can fish again, the bonus squares at h1, h4, and j6 are a huge threat.  TENAIL scores well and blocks these lines for your opponent.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?HJLLQY 11H J.LLY +30 103
#note While you might be tempted to try to draw an S or U for squishy, you are better off adding the Y to form JELLY.
>Evil_Kenji: AEGIRST H11 .AGER +42 77
#note Fishing here is a bit unnecessary and just sacrifices too many points.  Scoring 42 points, keeping a good leave, and taking the h15 TWS makes JAGER worthwhile over other fishing plays in this position.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?CHLOQS 5G Q.. +12 115
#note Fishing is worthwhile in this position.  Because the board is so open, you will often get to play a high-scoring bingo next turn.  Even if you don't draw a bingo, you will draw a high-scoring play.  Other options such as CLOQuE 14c, CHOLAS 12d, or SQuELCH 14e don't score well enough on future turns to make up for the difference in leave.
>Evil_Kenji: DEGINST 14B INGEST.D +74 151
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?CHLOOS 15H .eSCHOOL +100 215
>Evil_Kenji: ABEINTV 6H ..B +11 162
#note This is another rack when fishing is deceptively strong.  AEINTV forms many high scoring bingos, especially on this board.  On this board, there are multiple spots for bingos if you draw an A, C, E, G, N, O, R, S, U, or W.  This constitutes well over half of the tile pool, and several other draws can lead to other bingos.  Because there are no strong scoring plays, fishing with LOB is the best play.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AABDEOZ K2 ABODE +22 237
#note In response to fishing play, there are two basic goals that you should have: block the board and create scoring spots.  ABODE accomplishes both plays.  There is little chance that ZA will be blocked because of your opponent's bingo prone rack.  
>Evil_Kenji: AEINRTV O8 INTERVA. +86 248
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEEINSZ J2 ZA +66 303
>Evil_Kenji: GIIPRWX C10 WIRI.G +20 268
#note This is a fish for an A or an O.  Again, this fish requires sacrificing little equity, since WIPING is the highest equity play.  Keeping PX allows you a good opportunity to play PAX/POX l2 for 60 next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EEIINRS 2J ..IRE +28 331
#note Here is an example where fishing is not worthwhile.  While you could play IRE or REI and keep an extremely strong bingo leave, it is not worthwhile.  Since you are ahead, you don't want to increase entropy and keep a bingo leave on a wide open board.  Your opponent could potentially win by playing a bingo twice.  ZAIRE scores 22 points and still keeps a strong EINS leave.
>Evil_Kenji: AENOPTX 1L PONE +38 306
#note Although you do need to play a bingo, playing OX is simply overkill.  AENPT is not a very strong leave, and if you don't play a bingo you will often be unable to score.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEINOS L1 ..ANO +26 357
#note Again, fishing with YO or AGO is not worthwhile.  Scoring is important because you want to reduce entropy.
>Evil_Kenji: ?AIMPTX 10L MIX. +36 342
#note PYX may seem better, but actually it's not such a strong leave because of the lack of 7 letter bingo lines.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CDEFISU 12A CU.F +24 381
#note Much better than FUMY.  Again, there's no reason to fish.  Setting up an S line is okay since you have the case S.
>Evil_Kenji: ?AFMPTU M7 PFU. +13 355
#note UPWAFT keeps an unstable leave and closes bingo lines, while FUMY keeps the P which is not a good tile on this board.  You would like some vowels to bingo next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEINSY 14N Y. +20 401
#note While you don't necessarily want to fish, there's not much of an alternative now.  SYNDIC doesn't score enough to outlast a bingo, and no other play scores well.  YE lets you counter-bingo many of your opponent's bingos with a good draw.
>Evil_Kenji: ?AEMOOT 13G A.O +13 368
#note While you can play a bingo, doing so would be a disaster with 7 tiles in the bag after an opponent's fish.  Your lead will be too small and your opponent will be able to win with almost any rack.  You are best off waiting until there are fewer tiles in the bag or you draw a bingo that scores more.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ADEINSW G1 AW +12 413
#note With no good scoring option, you now have to block bingos and hope your opponent either has no bingo or draws bad tiles after they play a bingo.  AW limits bingo opportunities, maintained some bingo prospects for yourself, and still manages to win somewhat often if your opponent plays a bingo next turn.  Also note that you would have won after an opponent's bingo with this rack.
>Evil_Kenji: ?AEKMOT 12F OK. +14 382
#note With no bingo available, you need to maximize your bingo chances while reducing your opponent's.  OKA does the job quite nicely, trying to draw a bingo that ends in a vowel.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DEINSUV 9E VIE +11 424
#note This play does the best job at blocking opponent bingos.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of bingo possibilities left in the top left of the board.  Your opponent will play a bingo if an M or T is left in the bag.
>Evil_Kenji: ?AEMRTT L8 EM..s +34 416
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DNRSU 3E SUN. +12 436
>Evil_Kenji: AETT E1 TE.TA +10 426
>Evil_Kenji:  (DR) +6 432
