#note G3 ANURE(S)ES looks safer.
>Tunnicliffe: BEEIOPW A6 .WIPE +30 50
#note I don't know WEEPIE. Except I do. I have studied all the 4v6s. But apparently my brain is a sieve. (-9.5)

>Hildebrand: CDDHIRV M3 DI.CH +28 141
#note Quackle gives the edge to J2 VIR(I)D 21.
>Tunnicliffe: AFGMTUY B10 FUMY +33 153
#note Here I failed to consider contextual leave value. AGT + 5 is usually better than AMTY. But AMTY guarantees 2B AT(OM)Y 36 next turn. So I should play B10 FUG 28. (-3.4)

#note Quackle gives the edge to D12 F(O)RK 32 here. It hurts his bingo chances, but at this point, Jeremy needs a bingo and some decent nonbingoes. I'm sure the Q factors into this sim result, too.
>Tunnicliffe: AEEJLRW L2 JEA. +29 300
#note Here's where the wheels start to fall off. I passed up JOW/JOWL partly because I wanted to keep the W. Wait... why did I want to keep the W?? Retain a high-point tile with mostly 1-pointers unseen. AEELR and AEER are not great leaves, but with NNNNSSTTTT unseen, the bingo possibility is great (~40% with J(O)W!!). So JEA(N) was not the way to go, apparently. (-7.7)
>Hildebrand: AAGINRR L7 ARRAIGN +73 294
>Tunnicliffe: EHILRWZ 11J WH.Z +38 338
#note Okay. Changing my strategy and unloading all my high-pointers now. It felt like too many points. Quackle is fine with it.
>Hildebrand: ABEOQRT M11 .OA +31 325
#note Ooh. 2B BO(OM)ER 24 is really clever. Tough one to see.
>Tunnicliffe: EILLNRS J10 S.ILL +26 364
#note The wheels are off and the wagon is careening. I looked for a bingo, but did not consider INSTILLER. Okay, bingo miss aside, I can still win most of the time. The top nonbingo is 11E LIN(G) 18. This blocks the best Q spots, though. It feels like I then lose to a Q draw. I don't know. I am certain that SWELL is better than SWILL though. Obvious.
>Hildebrand: BEIQRTT 11E QI +28 353
>Tunnicliffe: AELNRTT C9 ATT +12 376
#note Disaster. I saw two T's on my rack and two unseen and panicked. I did not even consider the possibility of N overload. ATT is atrocious. C5 N(U)T 11. (-10.0)
>Hildebrand: BEORSTT 4L ..T +3 356
#note Clever going for an N for SORBENT and TROMBONES, but Quackle gives 100% to 12L (GO)B 6 or just 1E STROBE/SORBET 34.
>Tunnicliffe: ELNNNOR 6J EN +11 387
#note Tragically out of time. I can win this game with NONYL, NUN, RETINOL. Just didn't budget my time properly, and I suck at endgames under pressure. And I just didn't know NONYL.
>Hildebrand: BEEORST O4 SORBET +32 388
#note He can get more by hooking SWILLS or SMIDGE.
>Tunnicliffe: LNNOR D12 L.RN +10 397
#note I can STILL tie this game. But for good measure, I flush it down the toilet one more time. 3B ORPIN ties. Down to 9 seconds.
