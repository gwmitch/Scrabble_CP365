>Clone: ADEIQUY 8H QUAY +32 32
#note Best because of it's ability to set up QUAYSIDE.  In this case, you won't even necessarily need to draw the S: your opponent might play the S for you. 
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ABRRUUX K5 BUR. +18 18
#note Setting up the X without being overt. 
>Clone: ADEIJPS L4 JAPES +58 90
#note Even though you hit the setup, that doesn't mean you need to play it.  JAPES still scored very well and gives you a very good chance to play QUAYSIDE next turn.  JAPES also gives your opponent less to work with.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEORUUX 4L .EU +10 28
#note This looks overt, but it would easily also be a fishing play.  Although it looks like you could have the X, blocking will be difficult and the alternatives are poor.  
>Clone: CDEEINT N1 IND.CTEE +76 166
#note Well, so much for the setup.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEMORUX O8 MUREX +78 106
#note No setup, but this is even better!
>Clone: ADILNRZ 1J DIAZ.N +51 217
#note RIND isn't worthwhile as a setup since is sacrifices so many points and increases entropy.  Your opponent may become suspicious and chose to block, and you are opening more bingo opportunities for your opponent.  It's better to just take the points with DIAZIN.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAAIOOO -AAAIOOO +0 106
>Clone: ADILLRT J4 LAD +23 240
#note Scoring well while keeping the board closed.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DEEFIST 12K FEDE. +32 138
#note At this score, opening the bottom left quadrant is a must.  n11 plays can be blocked for a decent sized score too easily.
>Clone: ?ILLLRT -GKLW +0 240
#note Exchanging is better than opening a big S spot.  LULL reduces the odds of playing a bingo too luck.  The best leave is actually ILT? given this pool, since it is well-balanced.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?INRSST 9D STRaINS +73 211
#note Clearly the best bingo.  No reason to set up a big scoring spot for one extra point.
>Clone: ?ILORTV D2 ViTRIOL. +72 312
#note The only bingo.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEEILWW 11K EWE +30 241
#note Creating an S hook is a must with all those Os out.  Other plays block too much: EWE gives the best hope of keeping the board open.
>Clone: AEHKTTV 13I VAT +16 328
#note Keeping the board closed while creating a devastating setup for next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AINNOTW 5B WO.N +14 255
#note Keeping bingo lines open is a must.  I have no chance of winning without drawing the S: the S is essentially a ghost tile in my rack.
>Clone: EHKOOOT 10J KHET +58 386
#note Cashing the setup.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAILNOT 2B LA.ATION +76 331
#note The rumors about my death were a little premature.
>Clone: EGIOOOP 8B PO.IO +11 397
#note Trying to block bingo lines with this ugly rack.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AAGIILN J13 .A +4 335
#note Again, now is not the time to worry about the S. Without the S, this setup is difficult to block.
>Clone: BCEGOOR H1 G.OBER +36 433
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AGHIILN 15H NILGHAI +98 433
#note Again, setting up the S.  Despite the second bingo I'm still behind, and can't win without the S.
>Clone: CFGMORY 3A GOY.M +36 469
#note Trying to outrun the POISE out play.  This play outruns o14 plays next turn.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EIOS G6 OI +5 438
#note Setups don't need to be played immediately.  This blocks CORF and sets up an unblockable out play for next turn.
