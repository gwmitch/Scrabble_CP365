>jon_shreve: FLOT A7 LOFT +34 56
#note 10 OFT 39 is preferred by Q, but Jon said later he couldn't leave the lane open for an easy E hook

#note Spent a long time on this play, sure I was missing something. I did. ADDU(C)TOR/TRADU(C)ED. This is the best non-bingo option.

>trashman: ?ENRRTU 2H TRUN.lER +70 203
#note Spent a while on this play, also, looking for a double-double that wasn't there. However, Jon holds the play for several minutes, holding MAESTRO. He sees REARMOST from the R, but doesn't like the bingo, so challenges unsuccessfully...

#note I sacrifice points to take out the juiciest lane. Considered several plays on row 1 for 33

#note Cool play: 5G ASTR(OD)OME 69!!

#note Best
>trashman: AAEIITZ J10 ZI. +31 328
#note Q prefers J11 AGAZE and 2A ZETA
>jon_shreve: I 7K .I +5 277
#note He's gonna bingo next turn for sure...
>trashman: AAAEITX H12 .XIA +33 361
#note Interesting choice between this and ATAXIA at M6. XI for 38 at 4D is a crappy leave

>trashman: AAEOTUV G12 .OAT +21 382
#note Q prefers 2A AUTO, but the potential comebacks make it rather foolish...
>jon_shreve: AY I11 A.Y +29 373
#note Getting too close for comfort
>trashman: AABEEUV L12 BEAU +22 404
#note Best. Only other plausible options are exchanges, but I don't want to sacrifice a turn, despite the juicy lanes I've just opened...
>jon_shreve: DFRW 14J DW.RF +32 405
#note Ouch. Blocks my HEAVY...
>trashman: AEEHVWY D1 WH.Y +34 438
#note I almost make a fatal mistake here. 2A WHY is worth 9 more. Ack...
>jon_shreve: AENOPSU H1 S..PE +30 435
#note Jon spent most of his clock here, plotting his out-in-two. Later, he confessed he wasn't sure DWARF took an -S. It does, which probably could have led to a winning sequence: PAUSE for 37 leaving NO looks to secure a win...
>trashman: AEEV C12 .AV +18 456
#note I honestly didn't see his outplay, but with my clock running down, had to pull the trigger on what looked to be enough to win, and barely was. Great game, Jon!
