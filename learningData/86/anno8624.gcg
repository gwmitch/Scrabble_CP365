#note Don't quite understand what took champ so long here (over 5 minutes), or why it says (OX)O is the only play to win 100%.  Oh well.  I played this to block the highest scoring Q spot, although I suspect I shouldn't have bothered as there are Q(U)A(I) and Q(i) to consider.  Part of the problem was I was off by one tile and didn't realize an S was unseen.  Stupid, 'cause I could've counted.  SWANK was highly possible.  So (F)OE or (F)EN is best.
