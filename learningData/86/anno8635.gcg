#note arden cup div. A, for all the marbles. I need to either win, or not lose by more than 74 to take the title.

#note no matter what I give my opponent a nice hook. QUA appears to be better.

#note I prefer to play something more defensive with the spread issue, which Quackle can't really account for. Otherwise DOUR(A) is great.

>scott_jackson: GIPRRSY A7 PIG +30 162
#note Normally I'd do GRIPY, but for the same reasons as before I want to keep things a bit more closed and shut down the biggest scoring threats. This play is still pretty good either way.

#note I should fish instead holding the last S for JIVER (excluding the blank). Then again I'm blocking an R bingo and giving myself a new -S line anyway.

#note I didn't realie there was only six in the bag. Since losing doesn't matter unless it's 75+, this is a mistake because it allows him to possible bingo out, costing me the game and first place. I should probably do something like E(L)K which gives me a good shot at having two bingos spots for the next turn. I'd much rather bingo on row 14 of course.
