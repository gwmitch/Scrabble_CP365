#note from here to the end, i will stubbornly hold on to the case I. the Q isn't going to fit comfortably on this board anywhere other than 15A if I can help it. i should probably play TOD Ie here, but chose to muck up the G in COG bingo spot instead.

#note that was an unexpected draw.now i'm trying to avoid the Q. if i had looked more closely, i would realize i have all the things that can play in this column and would've played in the N column.

#note i challenged this because i knew he was getting the Q if it was good and it wouldn't matter if i did. and because this word looked ridiculous. POGY must never come up in word twist.
