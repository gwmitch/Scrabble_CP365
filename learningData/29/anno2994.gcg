#note Best.

>Jeremy: BJORTUY 15K R.BUY +30 140
#note -8.6 M11 JOB.  I'm going for an A draw to cash in on TAJ or better M11 next turn, but John will likely burn the spot if he has decent tiles.
>John: ADEHZ M9 HAZED +56 156
#note yowwch!  shoulda played JOB after all.
>Jeremy: ADJLOTY N10 YA +37 177
#note Quack says a -7.7 point penalty for chickening out on the high risk N8 JAY.  I keep the O for a huge JO/whatever play on a TWS next if John doesn't hit it first.  I don't feel like going into psycho mode yet.
>John: AIKOP G2 OKAPI +27 183
#note The hot spot stayed open!
>Jeremy: DDIJLOT 2D DOJ. +28 205
#note I can't take the hot spot either.  DOJ(O) is best by far.
>John: AIIN 1A INIA +19 202
#note Dodged another bullet.
>Jeremy: DEILOTT O5 DOTTLE +27 232
#note nearly TOILET(E)D this rack, but no open E.  -2.6 equity.  O6 TILDE keeping OT for 3 less is worth 2.6 more.  Must be due to a high leftover I count.
>John: CEFHI L3 CHIEF +31 233
>Jeremy: ILLRRTW D8 .LIRT +16 248
#note Can I draw or what?  My leave was an I. -3.2 TR(A)WL
>John: IISW H3 IWIS +42 275
#note This move kills me!
>Jeremy: ILLNRUW 3L .ULL +12 260
#note Quack likes the way more agressive I1 NURL by 3.7 equity, but 3 whole win percentage points up from 20 for my play to 23 percent for its play.  My play is to slow play and open the 1 row to bingo next turn if I need to.
>John: EENOORS 12A OES.RONE +60 335
#note oh noes!
>Jeremy: ?IMNRRW A7 RINgW.RM +86 346
#note I spot the only bingo, but it's dangerous.  It's also my only good chance to win.  Gotta draw that S out of the bag if I play this.  John already has a 7/20 chance of holding it.  If he doesn't have it, I have a 7/13 chance of drawing it.  Win percentage is about 43.5%
>John: EX K4 EX +41 376
>Jeremy: AACGNSV 15A SANG +60 406
#note I have 15A SCAG written down as the play, but because of SKAG I am not 100% sure SCAG is good.  I figure SANG is a much safer alternative.  I completely forego the thought pattern where I play H11 V(E)GAN like I'm supposed to getting the damn V off my rack and banking the S play for later.  V(E)GAN will win 78%.  15A SNAG wins a crummy 33.82%.  If I have any balls to play SCAG, I still win 67%.  Grrr.  Worst decision ever to play SANG. -24.3 point equity screw up.
>John: EEIMNOP I2 OPEN +32 408
#note yep, that wins.
>Jeremy: ABCGNUV H11 V.GAN +27 433
#note V(E)GAN is best but it loses by one.
>John: EIM N1 MI.E +12 420
#note What a game.
