>Dewin: EEHNUWY 8D WEENY +30 30
#note YEWEN is best. WEENY is 2nd, -0.5.
>A: AAIRTTU C7 UTA +17 17
#note Best.
>Dewin: ADEHIUZ E5 ADZ. +28 58
#note ADZE loses 16.8. 9F HAUD is best because you cannot get rid of Z while leaving nice tiles.
>A: AINORTV H1 VANITOR. +95 112
#note Duh.
>Dewin: EEHIOOU G2 EUOI +14 72
#note By now, Dewin's win % has dropped to 25%. G2 EUOI is 2nd, 2 points behind I2 EUOI.
>A: BCFGJLO D3 JOB +28 140
#note I thought of D2 GOLF. JOB loses to GOLF by 3.4.
>Dewin: EHIOORT B9 HOOTIER +79 151
#note Best.
>A: CEEFGLR A14 FE +26 166
#note Didn't know 15A GRECE. FE loses 16.8. 11A FOGLE, the less conservative play no doubt, loses 5.7.
>Dewin: ADHITTU A8 TATH +34 185
#note 3rd, -8.6. TUATH la. A5 HUTIA loses 8.1.
>A: CEGLNNR 2F L..RN +9 175
#note Horrible. I was entertaining CLEAN but thought it wasn't open enough. WTF man? LEARN loses to CLEAN by 7.2 points. I burn the R and keep crap. My win % is now 33.5%.
>Dewin: CDILOSU C11 CID +28 213
#note Good move. I'd just play COD and pick up 3 Is. This is best.
>A: CDEGGNS D12 GED +22 197
#note 4th, -2.9 here. Didn't see 4F COIGNED. GED loses to GEDS/DEGS.
>Dewin: ALLORSU G8 .ULL +5 218
#note NULL is weird. -14.3 here. 15D SURAL/SOLLAR/SORAL/SALOL/SOLAR all are close to top. 
>A: CGINNSS 4F C..NING +20 217
#note I saw COININGS but decided to keep two Ss. Bad decision since the other 2 are unseen. I lose 1.8 here.
>Dewin: AEIOPRS 11E PO.ARISE +90 308
#note Not really best, but who cares.
>A: EFIKMSS 10J KIFS +44 261
#note I now have about 12% chance of winning. For the sake of not having duplicate esses, I played KIFS. KEF beats KIFS by 4.2 because it doesn't congest the M column. I don't understand why KEF > KIF though. Maybe more Es left than Is.
>Dewin: ?ELMSXY 12L YEX +44 352
#note I'd play AXELS without skipping a beat. YEX is even more open than AXELS man. Dewin loses 8.4. Even 12K MY beats YEX by 4.6.
>A: EIMOQRS K9 Q.. +12 273
#note Not surprisingly, my move has the highest EQ but loses to 13I MORSE on win %. Better to take the spot than let your opponent have it.
>Dewin: ?BLMPST -BMP +0 352
#note LOL Dewin's win % is almost 100. Exch BMP loses 20 equity. Blocking the volatile spot with PST is best.
>A: EGIMORS 13G OGREISM +92 365
#note Duh.
>Dewin: ?AEELST 15D STEALEr +78 430
#note 1H VEALIEST will seal it man. Dewin loses 8 EQ here.
>A: ABIMPRW 14D .AW +30 395
#note No time to think, little chance to win. Must shoot for bingo, so I throw two tiles. I lose 2 equity here. 14D DIB/DAB are best.
>Dewin: ?AADENU 5K AUA +13 443
#note Anything wins, man. By now I've overtimed. ANYTHING WINS, EVEN AUA. I'll play UNDEAR/UNDEAD/UNDEAF/UNDATE/UNAWED to block IMPROV.
>A: BIMOPRV 1J IMPROV +50 445
#note Ok.... -.-
>Dewin: ?DEN 6L DENs +13 456
>Dewin: ?DEN --  -13 443
#note OK.........
>A: B N1 .B +8 453
#note Miss KIBE! But heck.
>A:  (?DEN) +8 461
