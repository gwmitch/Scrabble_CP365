#note Only keeping the Z? Fucking seriously? I hate you, Quackle. -3
>Jesse: ?EIMNRT N3 INTER.oM +69 207
#note Jesse missed a really, really, really sick bingo. Try to spot it.
>Evans: BHIORST 11A BIRTH +30 112
#note Why am I keeping OS instead of IS? BROTH is obviously better.
>Jesse: FGLOPUY A8 GLO.Y +45 252
#note I really knew this was phony. Like, seriously. I'm an idiot for not challenging.

#note RAZORED C7!! Holy shit. I missed tons of other stuff too -- ZA M3, ZOEA L1, ADZ M1... all better. Sigh. -22
>Jesse: ACEFINR H1 FRI. +48 326
>Evans: AADDEOR M1 ODA +14 232
#note I really wish I'd seen the OXO hook... but I suck for a lot of other reasons too.

>Evans: ADEEEIR M10 EIDE +15 247
#note Fishing off the E's at 7M is probably a little better, but this opens some decent bingo lanes. My play sims best.
>Jesse: ?ABELLO 15H LOsEABL. +80 446
#note I'm going to smack Jesse in like five minutes. By the time you see this, dear reader, Jesse will have been smacked. LOVEABLE is best. Just designate a different freaking blank. Jesus.

>Jesse: AELOQTU C9 TO.QUE +42 514
#note This gives me a huge comeback, thus it is stupid. Ha. Take that, Jesse. TOQUE 14D, which we both spotted while post-morteming, is best because it keeps AL and basically guarantees an out next turn, while not giving me a huge comeback.
