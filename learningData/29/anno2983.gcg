#note "Hey, this looks exactly like my stupid STAY MEN rack from last game." *shuffle shuffle* "Shit I missed AMNESTY last game." ETYMoNS is better. (-1.8)

#note G8 DO(T)E sims best. Personally, I'm quite sick of looking at all these vowels. (-8.9)

>Matthew: IIOPSUW L2 P.WS +32 207
#note I didn't want to do N1 WISP because of the hot spot it gives Lou. I guess opening up the triple to a SPEWS hook wasn't very smart. (-8.1)

#note Two turns ago I gave myself a leave of IIOU. Now I have bingo tiles. I miss SOVIETS as well as the massive 100-point star play N1 COSTIVE. I also miss the two nines. (-33.1)

#note With what was left, it looked like AEEGLST was the only rack that could beat me with SEGETAL in two spots. And I know I can't block both. The unconfident player in me got paranoid and decided to block the OVA-L hook anyways. I had a feeling I might be missing a bingo that would win without the SEGETAL rack. This was stupid. Something like G8 PO(T) wins just by putting the score out of reach. My play loses by three points 7 times out of 8. Huge endgame fuckup.
