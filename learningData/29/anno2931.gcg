>Noah_Walton: ?ABDEIX 8G XI +18 18
#note Bad miss of IBEX. Turns out this is only about one or two equity points worse.
>Kathy_Sutrov: IO 9F OI +13 13
>Noah_Walton: ?AABDEO 10B BAAED +25 43
>Kathy_Sutrov: AEIKRSZ C9 Z.IRE +48 61
#note She told me her rack afterwards. ZA is definitely better. 
>Noah_Walton: ?ABDHNO 7H BODHrAN +68 111
#note She stole my spot, but that was inivetable. I will not be a sighing bingoer*!  Quackle says HOB B12 is decent here too.
>Kathy_Sutrov: AKMS O5 MASK +43 104
#note I thought FACEMASK the whole game. Didn't know ANTIMASK though. 
>Noah_Walton: AEIIORT 11E RATIO +18 129
#note Didn't see IOTA 6G of consder 8J OI. Quackle ikes bot of them better than this by a good amount.
>Kathy_Sutrov: ADEENST 14C STANDEE +75 179
#note I think HASTENED is probably better.
>Noah_Walton: ?CEEFII 12I EdIFICE +76 205
>Kathy_Sutrov: OORT 15E ROOT +25 204
>Noah_Walton: ELPRUUV M3 UVUL. +16 221
#note I wasn't sure of PREVUE, whih is cerinly better by a bunch.
>Kathy_Sutrov: AOVW 6F AVOW +22 226
>Noah_Walton: EEJNPQR K11 Q. +22 243
#note I could use one of those Us right now. I think she said she had two Us right now as well. Quackle prefers JEEP 5C to this play.
>Kathy_Sutrov: DETW O11 T.WED +27 253
>Noah_Walton: EEJLNPR 5C JEEP +30 273
>Kathy_Sutrov: AHPS 4D HASP +35 288
#note Huh. She doesn't have the other S. Why not HAJ or CAP instead
>Noah_Walton: CGILNRR K2 GRINC. +24 297
>Kathy_Sutrov: OY N12 .OY +31 319
>Noah_Walton: FGGLORS M11 G.RL +28 325
#note FOGS is best on static evaluator, but this out sims the next play down by about 10%.
>Kathy_Sutrov: MU 13G UM +15 334
>Noah_Walton: FGLNORS H1 FOGS +38 363
#note I should play like I did last turn here. FON 6B does much, much better than this in the sim, as do things like FROG, GOR and FOR.
>Kathy_Sutrov: EU C5 .EU +11 345
>Noah_Walton: AELLNNR 6B N. +4 367
#note The winningest play here is LUNAR 7B. Oops.
>Kathy_Sutrov: EIINTTY 15J TINY +17 362
#note TIT N1 is a tad better. She obviously misscored this game, as she thought she had won this game afterwards.
