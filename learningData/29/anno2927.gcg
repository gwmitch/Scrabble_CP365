>Jesse: AHLNORT 8B ALTHORN +72 72
>Evans: CEEFIIK E7 C.IEF +26 26
#note Second-best. I didn't realize HICKIE was spelled with an -IE. -5
>Jesse: ADEENRR 10C RE.ARNED +65 137
>Evans: ?DEHIKR 12E sHIRKED +78 104
#note No, Jesse, playing KER(CHIEF) for 40 keeping DHI? is not right. This is the only bingo, so I played it. 
>Jesse: AEEORSV 7H OVERSEA +67 204
#note This elicited a nownow from me.
>Evans: AEEIMPX 8M MIX +42 146
#note Second-best. I lie awake some nights wondering if I'll ever be good enough to find stuff like EXEMPLAR C3. -8
>Jesse: IWZ 9I WIZ +31 235
#note Jesse decides to score a bunch of points for a change.
>Evans: AAAEEPR 11K AREPA +20 166
#note Missing the 13I spot. -8
>Jesse: OW 6J WO +28 263
>Evans: AAEEMNS 5J AMA +26 192
#note ENEMA is better. -4
>Jesse: DG L4 D.G. +19 282
>Evans: EEIINST H12 .EIN +12 204
#note Trying to give myself tiles to bingo through. I dunno, maybe I'll hit EINSTEIN or something. Quackle likes HIE F12, which is a great idea because it keeps EINST with a potentially juicy HIES lane. -9
>Jesse: LOTUY O10 L.YOUT +39 321
>Evans: EGINOST M3 GO +9 213
#note Worth a shot.
>Jesse: ?EGIIST 15B hEISTI.G +59 380
#note Jesse, did you see VESTIGIA? Seems kinda uber-safe to worry about opening a blank V in the 3x3 lane. Just take the points and enjoy being up 170, right?
>Evans: BEINSTV 2J VIBES +40 253
#note Changed my mind, I never really wanted to bingo anyway.
>Jesse: ACDENOT B1 ANECDOT. +76 456
#note NOW fucking NOW!
>Evans: NNQTTUY 1A Q.T +36 289
>Jesse: BLSU D1 SLUB +28 484
#note Jesse, you moron, way to miss SUB(CHIEFS).
>Evans: ALNNTUY 9B LA +19 308
#note This play isn't that good, but I just really wanted to play ANECDOTAL. Jesse, despite his 200-point lead, proceeds to call me a showoff. I proceed to tell Jesse to shut up. Debbie proceeds to direct a "Now, boys, play nice" across the table at both of us.
>Jesse: EFIJOOP 6F JOE +29 513
#note The best play is cool -- PIE E3 sets up UPO/JO next turn.
>Evans: NNTUUY 4D .UNNY +14 322
#note Best.
>Jesse: FIOP 14A FOP +22 535
#note Apparently Jesse hasn't scored enough already, so he mis-scores this as 24.
>Evans: TU 1N UT +8 330
#note Jesse rubs salt in my wounds by pointing to the EMU hook at 9M. -4
>Evans:  (I) +2 332
