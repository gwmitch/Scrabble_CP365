>Jason: GIIMOPR G8 POI +22 22
#note Brian was reviewing (reviewing, mind you) something like the 18,20-18,400 probability eights over breakfast. Reminded me of my Albany strategy: Make it a mudfest. Q likes MI at I8, which makes the board even uglier than this. (-3.3)
>Brian_Bowman: AGOT F7 TOGA +28 56
>Jason: EGIMRRU E4 URGER +20 42
#note Wasn't 100% on the clear play, GRUM at E5. (-12.6)
>Brian_Bowman: ASY 11D AYS +18 74
>Jason: FIIMMNO C9 MINIM +31 73
#note Yay for being able to give Brian an S while simming.

#note Very happy with the board configuration at this point, up a bingo.
>Brian_Bowman: BLO B8 LOB +27 151
>Jason: AGIKQTV F2 QAT +35 220
#note Like Pete said, no-brainers make me happy.
>Brian_Bowman: AELORST C9 .....A +10 161
#note Nice play from Bowman.
>Jason: GIKLOUV 15A VULGO +44 264
#note Took me a while to find this ... nearly played LUV just to make the board totally dreadful. Way I see it, I'm up 100. Brian will probably bingo at 14E, but only score about 70 and give me the triple coming back. If I can hit the triple for 30-ish, I'm up 60, he's got a random rack and the board isn't terribly open. Plus, time is running short.
>Brian_Bowman: EHLORST 14E HOSTLER +69 230
#note Step 1...
>Jason: ABDEIIK H12 KI.E +39 303
#note Step two. Six turns in a row with no equity lost, ABDI's not an atrocious leave, up 73. I'm finally going to beat Bowman in a non-bagging!
>Brian_Bowman: EZ 12A ZE.. +23 253
#note Ruh-roh. Esp. considering my DDR pick.
>Jason: ABDDDIR 13J BARD +20 323
#note A curious decision. At this point, given Brian's previous play and the pool, I'm conceding the bingo and just trying to make it on my terms. Hoping it comes down column N so that I get the triple coming back. I'm still ahead by enough that I think I can outrun it. Valuation leader is DID at B4, which I considered; BARD is about five percentage points and 10.5 equity points behind. Did I get too fancy here?
>Brian_Bowman: ?ENOPTW L6 uPTOWNE. +76 329
#note Ooh. Worthy of a "nice play."
>Jason: CDDINNO B4 NOD +19 342
#note Missed CONIN, which I realized that night. Might have made a difference. (-8.2)
>Brian_Bowman: AFILR 15K FILAR +33 362
>Jason: ACDEIJN 10J JA.ED +36 378
#note CP's pick, winning 70% of the time. JE(W) leads in valuation. (-4.9)
>Brian_Bowman: DEEISSU M1 DISEUSE +74 436
#note Hmph. Mediocre play from me at the end, good play from Brian, and he takes the 1-0 lead.
