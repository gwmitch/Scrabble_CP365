#note Quackle says this sucks. BPS isn't very wonderful. But DOZES as better? Anyway, it likes ZEPS or, best of all, setups like BED, DEB and BOP.

#note Not such a good idea-no need open up this board. PINTS 12D is fine.

>Noah_Walton: BEINRRS 2F BR. +11 378
#note Didn't know BRINERS. Quackle likes BRR or ARB more than this. Didn't notice BRR.

>Noah_Walton: EEINORS 13A ...INES +31 409
#note I thought the pool was slightly different, containing INPRSTUV. If that were the pool, I think this would be best, blocking TURNIPS. I was looking at how many bingos SENIOR makes with this pool, but when I looked at TURNIPS, I knew I needed to block it.
>Gail_Wolford: INRSTUV -  +0 290
#note VIRUS 14H is best. She challenged REXINES though. Apparently it is new?
