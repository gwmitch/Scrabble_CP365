#note This sims best, but whenever I have an early X like this I feel like there may have been some cool setup play I didn't see, or something like that. This seems fine though.

>Sam: IIKOOTX 9D KOI +12 28
#note Didn't really like making this play, since Jason probably has another S (not definitely, though) for MOBS. It sims best though, and I don't see any other acceptable options.

#note Quackle's top-simming play is AG G10, which I think is unplayable. I'd be surprised if anyone would do that. Other than AG, they like three plays at 8C better than mine: COG, TOG, and GOT, respectively. I just really don't want to play the board after COG down 30 and with him playing. I like my play, opening the board up now. Any thoughts?
>Jason_Keller: DDU -  +0 76
#note Jason challenged COGITO.

#note Would you believe me if I said I drew the blank after this play and still lost? Jason held this but let it go. Quackle thinks this is a horrible play, which makes sense given some higher-scoring options. Did I not even look at the 2M spot? FIL looks nice: scores 23, keeps a synergistic (I think?) leave, and gives me an easy opportunity to hit that triple if I draw an A or E. Even if I don't, it's not a very high-scoring spot. Don't know why I played this. Damn.

#note I was pretty sure I could get away with TU* here. I think it's the only phony two I've ever played, and the only "misplay" of mine like that since JUDGI* in Princeton '08. I misscored this as 13 also. Of real plays, Quackle thinks something like ANON 2A or NOUN M6 is good. This is sort of an in-between play.

>Sam: ?AJLNOR 6B JO +30 291
#note Quackle clearly prefers RAJ/JAR 1M. I think I see why. I figured that since the V/C ratio was 13-12, I should keep ALNR? and one vowel would be enough. I guess that with ALNO?, draws of 0, 1, or 2 vowels aren't terrible, while with ALNR? a draw of 2 vowels could work out pretty badly. Also the LR seems to have poor synergy, though I might be wrong.

#note I realized after the game that I probably could have just outrun Jason with MARL 11K instead of leaving him that easy scoring spot. It sims best of course. Also simming well is LAR 1M. I think that MAR forces me to bingo to win, so why not play LAR and go with the MUCH improved leave?

>Sam: ?AILNRW K11 ..W +8 314
#note Champ. Player likes AW M8, WO 6M, WEN G3, and CAW M11 better than this. What? Is that because it's harder for him to block row 13 without giving me another spot? After AW, Jason can win with whichever rack he had, AEGIOSY or AGIOOSY, by playing OY 10K. This seemed like the only logical play. Anyone with other ideas?
>Jason_Keller: AOSY 14K SOYA +23 375
>Sam: ?AEILNR 15L REIN +25 339
#note NAIL 15L is best, this 10 points back. I ran my clock very low making sure there were no bingos, so didn't take long thinking about what to actually play here.
>Jason_Keller: EGIO H12 .OGE +15 390
#note GIE 8A is three points better.
>Sam: ?AL 14F LA.s +6 345
#note Only had a couple seconds to slap this down, obviously there are better plays. LAs K7 is highest-scoring.
