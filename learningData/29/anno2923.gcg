#note I thought no bingos played... little did I know that TACTILELY and TACHYLITE both played through the disconnected T-C. Instead I phony John with GORER and it stays.
>John: EFNS K3 FENS +22 111
>Evans: AILNOSY 11J YO +19 143
#note Q says to take the points and play longer with YONI (27, ALS) rather than this (19, AILNS). Close call. -3
>John: EFLSW 12H FLEWS +42 153
>Evans: AILMNSU H12 .ILM +27 170
#note Missing the really pretty ALUMNI 8A, as well as AIMFUL 3H. Also worth noting: Superleaves pegs INSU at 4.89 and ANSU at 4.25, meaning FLAM is better than FILM. I often forget that the I isn't so bad when its good friend N is around. -17 (yikes, ALUMNI is that good)
>John: ?ELORUV 15A VELORiU. +89 242
>John: ?ELORUV --  -89 153
#note Valid bingos John could have played: OVERFOUL, OVERFULL, TRUELOVE, PULLOVER and VERMOULU.
>Evans: ABDNSTU 15F DU.B +9 179
#note FUB 3K and BEDU 4J are obviously better, since they block his highest-scoring bingos. This mistake, I think, reveals a key leak in my game -- I need to respect my opponents more. I played DUMB here because PULLOVER was his most obvious bingo, and I thought it might be the only one he saw. But of course if he sees OVERFULL, blocking it with FUB is clearly the play! I saw OVERFULL right away, and there's no reason he wouldn't do the same. I should have just blocked the best bingo, but instead I decided to gamble and hope he wouldn't see it. That's not a good idea. With rack inferences in the sim, this play is -20.

#note I deserve that.

>John: JO J14 JO +35 268
#note Of course he blocks LABIATES.
>Evans: AABEIST 9M AB +15 218
#note Scores more at 7L. -2
>John: ERR 7L ERR +13 281
>Evans: AAEGIST F14 A. +5 223
#note This is such a disgustingly obvious fish, but I don't expect John to block the N up top with a dinky 5-point play. AEGIST seems pretty awesome given the circumstances. Maybe I should just open the board with TAIGA 14B though? Quackle thinks so. I'm not sure.

#note Sims best. Worth a shot, no?
>John: ADINV D9 VIAND +23 336
#note Ugh, he has to have a V, doesn't he?
>Evans: ACEIIST 6D AI +13 244
#note Honestly, it doesn't look like I have a better option than this. Pathetic.
>John: IP 7C PI +9 345
>Evans: CEIIOST 8A ICE +19 263
#note Scores well and opens a potential lane for eights. Sim loves it.
>John: HNT A7 H.NT +7 352
#note Makes sense.
>Evans: DIOSTUZ 14J .UDOS +26 289
#note I missed STUDIO 1A, which is nice because it puts me out of my misery faster. ADZ 11D is an option because it leaves one on the bag and fishes with a decent leave, but I have no clue what I'm fishing for or where it plays. This play isn't that bad.
>John: EIKNNST 11C T.NK +16 368
#note SKEAN 11A is best.
>Evans: GIITUZ F4 Z. +11 300
#note I saw ZIN 12B and opted against it. I was wrong. I get ZIN for 14, he gets ZINE/ZEIN for 26, I get GUT 13M for 16, he drops the S for DUMBOS, 13 and out -- that, with 2 from my rack, is an 11-point swing his way. ZA scores 11 and only gives him back 17 when he goes out with SINE/STANK, but when you add the 12 on my rack, it's an 18 point gain for him. I forgot to consider those extra 12 points. -7
