>hector: ADIOPRS 8G POD +12 12
#note SPAROID, a Top 4000 miss, good way to start (I did see a lot of the potential 8s but this rack needs to be converted). The best non-bingo plays are all pretty close together except for PODIA 8D, which is a runaway winner. 
>jeff: EEIIRTZ 9G IRE +16 16
#note Quackle likes ZIP G6, which builds an interesting leave (albeit 3v2c) and doesn't offer a lot to the opponent. IRE was the best static choice, but is 3.4 points back of ZIP, and slightly behind some other Row 9 plays (TIRE, TIE, ZITI). At the end of the day, it's probably a stylistic choice and I can see different players opting for different paths; this is the type of rack where I might pick one path today, a different path next week. 
>hector: AAEGIRS 10F AGA +15 27
#note I knew there were no bingos here - SAGIER plays through the consonants in "women love this sage." AGA is best by a couple of points; sure, I'm offering easy front hooks to the E column, but I'm holding two of them. 
>jeff: ?EGILTZ J2 GLITZEs +96 112
#note I'm afraid if I held this rack I might sell out for the E4 placement too quickly, but Jeff correctly diagnoses that the J2 spot is better because of how the Z falls. That's playing well, taking the extra time to make the right choice. 
>hector: DEIMRSS 11D DIMS +25 52
#note DIMERS, I just discovered, plays through MONKEY WOMAN (mention that to Mick and Keith next time you see them). There are some interesting extensions to MONKEY, too (but MAN and WOMAN don't fly). DIMS is best, but don't worry, I'll be flushing equity later. 
>jeff: DEEILOO D8 DIL.OE +20 132
#note Most of the preferred plays get rid of at least four tiles from this messy pull, but the top simming choice, OOZE at 6H, scores just 13 and draws to IDLE. Hmm. Maybe it's the power of pulling a bingo and/or getting to L6. The second pick is OLEO 12A, which shows how the triple line loses value when the DLS is covered (I still don't like that play, however). DILDOE is about three win-percentage points back, along with a host of other choices. 
>hector: ?EEORSX C3 xEROXES +100 152
#note By my quick scan of Quackle there are 23 (!) bingo choices here (word duplications allowed in different spots), which shows how dynamic this rack is. I lazily put my play down in the E column first before realizing the mirror image fit the suit much better. I didn't know the best play available, see if you can score a few more than I did. 
>jeff: EEKLNOU 4G UNL.KE +22 154
#note EKED at 8A takes the lead - even with 3v2c in the leave, ELNOU is a synergystic group and there may be friendly consonants to play through next time.  Plus, hey, 27 points is okay and it might even offer some defense to the juicy 6B spot (a J-bomb is a lot harder now). KUNE at D2 and KOINE at 4H come next. I also want to mention EKUELE, which is defined as "a former monetary unit of Equatorial Guinea." I used to need six words to describe those units, now I can use one. Love our dictionary. 
>hector: AAEORTY B6 YET +40 192
#note AYE in the same area is best and I can see why - much better leave (TORA as opposed to the hideous AAOR) and I'll have at least one of those tasty spots next time (I may have overrated what A7 in front of EX would be worth). I was so focused on this area that I didn't see the second choice yet (KOA K4); had I seen it and picked it, this game would have played out much differently. But AYE is the play, and I lose 5 points of equity for YET. 
>jeff: EIILNOR 2F RELI.ION +61 215
#note Jeff knew the RELIGION rack had three total hits and couldn't recall LIGROINE over the board (he saw the other two). Kudos for converting a rack that doesn't look particularly promising. That said, there's actually a better play through the Z. I am 100 percent sure I would have missed that. LIGROINE comes in second, 6.2 points back, and RELIGION is about 15 back of the best (and unobvious) play. 
>hector: AAAIOQR K4 .OA +29 221
#note This runs away with the sim, there's nothing else worth doing. The clear second choice is a word I'd almost never see, ZOARIA. 
>jeff: DEHJNOW 1L JOHN +85 300
#note Clearly best, and Jeff is now an 88 percent favorite to win. JEON is nine points fewer and 10 valuation points behind. The WED leave is pedestrian normally but strong in this sort of position, up a bingo and looking to outrun; he's guaranteed a good score next turn. 
>hector: AAIMNQR 1G RAM +27 248
#note I took my longest turn of the game here, debating between RAM and MARINA 1A and some other choices. RAM wins the sim by a couple of points. Over the board I really had no clue what was best. 
>jeff: ADENRWW D4 DEW +31 331
#note Three places for WAW (B2, C13, C12) lead the sim, but DEW gets your best score and it's just one win pct point behind. 
>hector: AAINQTU F6 QUA +39 287
#note QUA is best, followed by AQUA same spot, and then there's a big gap to the next best plays - two cute but (IMHO) unlikely-to-work gambits: AA at C13 and AE at 13C. Both of those plays give you a ready-made gigantic comeback at B10 next time (for 75 points) but good luck having the spot still available. QUA scores too many sure points to pass on. 
>jeff: ABFNORW C12 BROW +26 357
#note Score, keep running. A lot of ways to do it on this board, the best the cute REWAN at 5C. BROW is safer at B1 than C12, although there's some value to covering the naked E and a potential S hook (albeit Row 14 bingos would offer a giveback). 
>hector: AIINSTU 6F .I +11 298
#note Here's where I start playing like dirt. I did see UNWIT but I talked myself out of it, even as I knew UNWITTED was good. If I'm going to play for a bingo, I'm better off pitching -IU as opposed to my play. 
>jeff: AEEFNPY 15A FE. +27 384
#note FAWNY and YAWP come out best, but anything that covers the W makes you a gigantic favorite to close. 
>hector: AFINSTU 5C ..F +12 310
#note I was aware of the dearth of Es and I did put in time here, just didn't come up with a good play. Mind you most of the "good" plays here get you to a 3-5 percent winning chance, and I got to 2.56, so what's the big deal. TOFU at 5J is the bonanza and will win for you once in 20 games.  Didn't see it. Pitching -FU also beats my pick. 
>jeff: AEHNOPY L6 PAY +26 410
#note There's a bingo on this rack but it doesn't go down. Just about all the good plays here use the ZAP hook, with PONY the best. 
>hector: AINSTTU E13 TUT +6 316
#note RUN at F2, forming NUNLIKE, pretty cool. YUAN, which I almost did, comes second. TUT is pretty cheesy, not that anything will win here. 
>jeff: AEGHNOS F14 HA +28 438
#note Every top choice comes in winning over 99.8 percent of the time, so pick what you like. SHOG and SHAG M6 score the most. HO is actually slightly preferred to HA even as it's the case O and there are two As unseen. YOGH 8L is a good play. Lots of options. 
>hector: AAIINNS M8 ANI +9 325
#note This sims best and gives me about a 1.8 percent chance to win from my perspective, says the Duck - you know, if Jeff quits the game so he can join the circus. Well, at least it's best. 
>jeff: CEGNOST N5 CONGEST +77 515
#note Very nice. Maybe it's just me, but YA-G as a hook still doesn't jump out, even as I know it. YAGI I never have a problem with, but YAG still looks so darn weird. 
>hector: ACINSUV 12H VICUNAS +93 418
#note Lucky me, I get a cookie on the way out. And I'm also happy to report we scored the game accurately, A to Z. As always, Jeff, thanks for the great company and games, not to mention the delicious sandwich. You have my permission to throttle everyone in Ortonville.
