#note Spent a lot of time mulling this one over. Q likes B6 ZEALOT, but I wanted to hold on to at least one vowel. Also considered B6 ZOA, L1 DOZER, and 4F ZOWIE. Tough call.

#note Best. Although Eric draws the final blank, he's unable to make an outplay that scores well enough to win.
>Eric_Harshbarger: ?BIU 9K .UB +10 384
#note His only outplays are 10H ABULIc or ABULIa, which leave him 6 points short. Q likes G2 BUsS 17, but there's no winning sequence.
