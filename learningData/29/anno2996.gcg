>Sam: AADKRVX 9F AX +36 48
#note The only plays I saw were VODKA G7 and AX. Then, after laying AX down on the board, I noticed VODKA 6C, which seemed superior to AX. I figured that having already shown Auggie my X, I shouldn't change my play, since he'd be sure to block any good X spots. Would you have switched to VODKA 6C even after showing opp. AX?

>Sam: AAGLRSV C2 VAGAL +20 96
#note After 8,148 iterations, the sim likes VAIL 10B by 0.7 equity points over VAGAL. VAIL is, admittedly, a very interesting gambit. The thing is that Auggie will almost surely block the spot if he sees the front hook, which he probably would. There's also, of course, the chance that he has an A himself, which would really make me screwed. I like VAGAL, but VAIL is a good choice also, I think. It's very volatile, which is good down this much. Any thoughts?

#note Completely whiffed on HERTZ J10, which seems best to me. The sim also slightly prefers ZLOTE 6B, which I missed as well, but I'm not sure that's better. At least I set up another bingo lane with mine, and at least I had enough sense to pass on ZIGS 4A. Should have seen at least one of those two though, esp. HERTZ.

>Sam: CEGGOSU B6 COG +24 215
#note COG is in a statistical dead heat with GOUGES L1, which I thought at the time was too open. Now I see its benefits of reaching into this bag for that last blank, but I think its negatives are strong as well. I don't love COG, but I don't think GOUGES is necessarily better.

#note This play took a long time to find, and yet Quackle hates it. I didn't know TOGUE M10, which is a 12.5! point error. That's a great play. Barring that, or TOGUE/TOGUES in other spots, I like OUTSEE O1, which has turnover working for it. I need to know words like TOGUE, though.
>Augustine_Adda: DOPR M10 PROD +22 271
>Sam: EGLLOST L12 LOG +15 246
#note While it's actually not simming that poorly (third, though 8 equity points and almost 3% behind the leader), this was a game-losing mistake. With EEEES?, I'm just asking for it. Just LEG would have much better, despite the worse leave. Quackle's favorite is GELT, I guess just for the points. I'm not sure if that's any better than LEG, though. Would you play LEG or GELT? I know that LOG was wrong, though.

#note I deserved the punishment. Good find by Auggie.

>Sam: DEIILUY 14F DUI +22 298
#note Nothing leaves a guaranteed out-in-two, as far as I can tell. This is three points behind the best play, which is a little cooler. Can you find it?
>Augustine_Adda: AANNTW F3 WAN +19 403
#note Auggie's best would have been NAAN B11, 13 points better, since it blocks my out. The answer to last turn's puzzle was IrID 11C, which leaves ELUY for YULE O3. Auggie's only block is TAW 4L, which isn't worth it at all, so I go out first.
