#note Didn't think of BODEGA, which Quackle likes better by about a point.

#note It took me a long time to make this play, which, well, sucks. I did't think of LOUIE , which, rightly, sims best. Many other choices are better-I would rather not shed the S and play this, but Quackle still likes BOUSE or HOUSE 11F (which I don't like at all).This is about -10, but it deserves worse.

>Noah: DEEHINS D8 .EHIND +26 121
#note Why do I keep making such bad plays??? I thought of HE/HIED and didn't play them. HOW!! OF COURSE THEIR BETTER.
>Demigod: AEIINRR M8 RAINIER +77 193
>Noah: EGRSTVZ 1A ZET. +43 164
#note Didn't see RITZ. I really need to like for like,more than thirty seconds. I wasn't sure if ZIG wowuld better. I still am not sure about it. Quackle likes ZIG, but I don't feel like ERSTV is that great of a leave in this position. It certainly isn't for eights, at least. But apparently it bingos about 40% of the time. What do I know.
>Demigod: ?DENNOR 2H DONNERt +77 270
>Noah: AGJRSSV 14A JAGS +37 201
#note Didn't see JAGS 3G, which, despite Quackle's preference of my play, I like better. It doesn't allow as much parallel play and leaves the BEHINDS hook open. I actually like 3G a whole lot now that I see it.
>Demigod: AEIITTU 13C A.IEU +20 290
>Noah: AEMRSVX H12 EXAM +56 257
#note How very lucky of me. Quackle likes VEX 3G, which I didn't notice, but should definitely play.
>Demigod: ADIIPTT 1L PAID +40 330
>Noah: GQRSTVW -GQVWT +0 257
#note Declined exchanging GQVW because the pool is not exactly vowel heavy and because there are so many Ts left in the bag. Quackle disagrees with me by about .10%, but I stand by my choice.
>Demigod: CHIRTTU C9 HUT +27 357
>Noah: ?CLPRSS L1 ..PS +16 273
#note Didn't see LISP, which Quackle likes a lot because of it's triple opening. I kind of liked that this opened another bingo lane.
>Demigod: CEIRSTW 8L W.IT +33 390
>Noah: ?CLQRST N7 Q. +11 284
#note Worst. Draw. Ever. Quackle likes QuILTS (didn't know WOVENS) or QuILT beter than this. Quackle is right. I am playing really, really badly in this game. I have to fix that.
>Demigod: CENRSTV F12 R.V +14 404
>Noah: ?CGLRST 4B CL.. +9 293
#note I liked this play. Quackle likes LEG or GEL 13L. This play was the only play I could see that gave me bingos next turn. LEG or GEL look like they could be better, but overall, this doesn't seem so bad.
>Demigod: CENOSTT 4G CONTE.TS +61 465
#note Of course, he could also just bingo.
>Demigod:  (AGRRST?) +14 479
