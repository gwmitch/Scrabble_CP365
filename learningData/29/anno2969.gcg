#note I asked Dave about this rack after the game and he said he agreed with my play. After about 2,000 two-ply iterations, Quackle slightly prefers my play to in win%, but likes IOLITE 8G or 8C better for valuation. Another contender is OI 8H, which I considered--I think that's better than the 8G placement because of my L. Given my opponent (who I think probably has better world knowledge), I like my trade. Would anyone play IOLITE or OI, or something else? I wouldn't.
>Dave_Koenig: ?ADDMRW 8G WARD +16 16
#note This rack is accurate for Dave.
>Sam: EGILLPT 9C PIGLET +21 21
>Dave_Koenig: ?DEJMOO J8 .OJO +28 44
#note I'm pretty sure this is what Dave said his rack was. If so, DOOM 8A is another good option.

#note After about 2,000 two-ply iterations, Quackle prefers NOR K9 and ON K10 by about a point each to this bingo. Two questions for readers: 1) Do you agree? Would you have forewent the bingo? 2) If so, why is not playing the bingo better? How do you develop the intuition of when to forego bingoes like these? I think that part of it is leaving the blank A next to the TLS, but I'm still surprised.
>Dave_Koenig: EEMM 7F MEME +25 146
>Sam: AILQRTW B5 QI +16 180
#note Quackle doesn't like QI at all. Its favorite is LAW B4, closely followed by TRAWL B2, and there are several other options preferred to QI. TRAWL seems like a dynamic play, leaving QI and QAID/QADI options. I guess LAW is preferred to it due to its better leave and three more points. I guess keeping the Q isn't so bad here, and ALRTW is a much crappier leave than I realized. 
>Dave_Koenig: DV I11 D.V +14 160
>Sam: ADLNRTW 14G DRAWL +25 205
#note DRAWN might seem superior due to not taking the S-hook, but WARD's already on the board. DRAWN and DRAWL are probably the same--they're simming equally.
>Dave_Koenig: EEV 15F VEE +27 187
>Sam: AINPSTU 5B .UIP +30 235
#note Dave and I talked about how I was fortunate to have a place to play off my worst tiles for good points here.
>Dave_Koenig: AFTU 4D TUFA +22 209
#note Something I learned recently--TOPH and TOPHE both mean "tufa"
>Sam: AINRSTU L8 NUTRIAS +76 311
#note This fortunate draw was the turning point
>Dave_Koenig: AGHST H1 GHAST +39 248
#note I held this, but never seriously considered challenging.
>Sam: ABBEEIS 11E EBB +26 337
#note Long story: Auggie played BrIBEES on me in Round 5 to virtually end our game. As I held this rack, I look at Auggie sitting next to me, and he's just played six tiles. The one tile left on his rack is an R, so I cover my A with my thumb and point it out to him: his R + my BBEEIS, which we thought was funny. After the tourney, we were talking about this rack, and Auggie quizzed me on the seven if you changed the E to an A, which I got instantly: BABESIA. Of course, I couldn't find it during the game, as BABESIA 3G looks best here. I missed the spot (which I saw later) for ABBE K5, which gets rid of another vowel.
>Dave_Koenig: CEILTTY 3G T.CITLY +35 283
#note This is Dave's real rack--he looked up THETICLY* after the game. The real word in those letters is TETCHILY, which Dave pointed out that he missed in his blog. Certainly a tough find. I noticed that he could have played aNDROGENIC here--I saw it as soon as I played aNDROGEN, but never had the right tiles for it. 
>Sam: AAEEINS 1G A.ENESIA +60 397
>Dave_Koenig: AIZ -  +0 283
#note Dave challenged AGENESIA
>Sam: FINORUY B10 YON +32 429
#note Championship player likes TURFY K3 by a lot, for whatever that's worth. It is simming better many-ply as well. Anyone see any reason it's better than YON? I figured I'd just take the most points available since the leave was reasonable and it left one in the bag. I see just now that TURFY blocks THIAZINE, but is that the concern? Or is it something else? I honestly don't know.
>Dave_Koenig: AIZ 8L .AZI +39 322
>Sam: AFIIORU N6 FI. +23 452
#note Dave: "You blocked my out!"
>Dave_Koenig: EHKNO M6 OK. +28 350
#note Surprisingly, this is not even one of the top 15 plays! It sure looked good to me over the board...but it lets me play OR K10, which I missed (despite looking in that spot! Didn't see DORR...). I think Dave can sort of slow-play me here since I can't go out soon.
>Sam: AIORU K3 .OUR +8 460
#note OR K10 is best, with any T??? play coming in second.
>Dave_Koenig: EHN 10L .HEN +9 359
