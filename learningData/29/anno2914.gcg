#note Keeping the P is actually a fairly significant error here. Quackle says -3.

#note Not sure what, if anything, I was thinking here. The sim details show my next turn scoring way, way less -- like 10-12 points less -- than if I play JUN C1 or PUNJI J8 here. This BINN leave sucks. -8
>John: EFM G11 FEM +25 300
#note Scores 2 more at I9.

#note TWO J9 is 1 point more.
>Evans: AAINNOY N12 YON +25 399
#note Quackle wants to either play FANION 11G or ANYON B4, which turn over more tiles. There are still two blanks and an S and a bunch of other goodies unseen. Statically this play is fine, but... -6

#note Wow, John didn't know DROVED. An incredibly lucky break for me.
>Evans: AAINNRZ G2 AZAN +29 455
#note This play is awful -- potentially game-losing-ly so -- because it gives him the HAZAN hook. I am an idiot.
>John: ??EIIOT 11E In..nTE +37 425
#note Best by a mile. Awesome find.
