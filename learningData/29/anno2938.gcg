#note Maybe exchange DRM.  I'm open to either play.  Kinda want a more defensive game, and DRRS? hits enough, but there's a lot to be said for trading here too.  Probably like trading a little better but it's close and not that important long term.

#note I'm not a big fan of the attempted run-through here.  Still like my play.  L1 is too easy and too dangerous, and if possible I want to make opponent make the right choice between the 5 15-20 point plays available.

#note Ow.
>Kenji: EGNOOPS F1 OP +24 381
#note Not that sure here.  I want to stay in range, so this seems best, but I could be convinced otherwise.

#note I thought recoinages played for a second.  Trying to hit plays like iodinates and other things while outscoring qintar.  Not sure what else I can try and hit.  I think that the IN and G will be blocked.  Two tiles seems best to negate the QI c2 play.  Chances are slim, and hitting the W seems impossible.  Quackle prefers OAT which is a slight improvement.

>Kenji: AEINSTY B2 TINES +23 419
#note Pretty bad but I don't really care.  ELOIN could easily be missed too.  Already kind of bummed knowing I'm going to be 3-2 negative, which is already a devastating day even if I win the next 3 games.  Little did I know that I should've been pretty happy to go 7-2 negative...
