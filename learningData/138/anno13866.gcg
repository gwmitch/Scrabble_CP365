>Jim_Burlant: ?DENOOU F6 UN.OOkED +64 64
#note Nothing plays down the H column, and none of the other bingo options (G6 UNHOOKED, UNHOODED, 7I OUTDONE, I3 UNROOFED, G8 HONOURED) scores more than 65.  I chose this because this had the best defensive position I could see (slightly better than UNCOOLED because I can't front-overlap the K), and Quackle agrees.  This tops the sim, UNCOOLED is a close second, and the other bingo options sim 3 - 4 points down.
>PH: ABPRSUX J8 SUBPAR +29 53
#note This was his rack - Q likes E3 BRUX.  Our next sequence of plays should go a long way towards telling you the kind of night I was having.
>Jim_Burlant: EEOPRTV 13I P.OVE +26 90
#note The only 8's in this rack are OVERSTEP and OVERPERT.  With no open S, I didn't look for the former, and I'd have never found the latter.  Good thing for me he put down SUBPAR - I might have played OVERkEPT* for zero.  Anyway, not much else here.  Next best play is to play POET K9 keeping the V.  When I put this down I was feeling good - I had just scored 26, and was drawing 4 to ERT barely a turn after an opening rack blank bingo.  When I saw my next rack vis-a-vis what he put down, I realized I was in for a tough one.
>PH: DEENSTX N9 EXTENDS +123 176
#note Off his six-tile draw to an X.  Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: EKMQRTY M8 KYE +32 122
#note I did not auto-pilot this and, in retrospect, given his next rack it's a good thing for me I couldn't think of REEKY 12D.  Q indicates (correctly) that REEKY is 2-1/2 points better because it clears an extra consonant out of this crappy rack.  But against his next rack this was definitely the best play I could have made.
>PH: ADEEMRS 15L ME.A +27 203
#note Paul told me that KYE blocked SMEARED...and he obviously didn't notice the open letters in the F column as he had MEASURED 6B or SEADROME 10A.  This is his best non-bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AJMNQRT O7 QAT +42 164
#note Yet another sign I'm in for a tough one.  Tons of I's, a fair number of A's and O's and E's still unseen...and the majority of my 3-tile pick is more low-prob tiles.  Arrrrgh!!!!  
>PH: CELR 11B CLER. +12 215
>Jim_Burlant: AJMNORU E2 JORUM +32 196
#note Another play on which I took a LONG time, as I was looking for something at C9 or D8 that doubled the J...and Quackle confirms there is nothing. The sim and Championship Player diverge substantially here.  The sim thinks that I should forego the points and play D10 JEU.  Really?  Is AMNOR that much stronger than NA given this board and the 12 scoreboard points given up? OTOH, Championship player likes this an awful lot more and says  that this is clearly my best play, and that it wins 33%.
>PH: FI 12C IF +22 237
>Jim_Burlant: AAANWYZ D3 WAN +23 219
#note Saw the obvious rack dump of AWAY D6 and passed, as it didn't defend.  And having played Paul many times before, I felt that if he was dumping 2 tiles, he was  close to something on rows 3 or 4 and that my first priority was to limit him to the  B or H columns.  For some reason I can't fathom, I thought WARY 4D still left some limited possibilities on row 3, and I wanted to kill all of that.  At the time I felt the Y had to wait. I knew Quackle wouldn't like this choice, and I was right - it indicates that WARY was the play.  WARY should have been the play, as it not only unloads the Y, but sets up ZA 3B on the next turn.  Like I said, I don't know why I thought it was so weak defensively.
>PH: AGG K11 AG.G +23 260
#note Play incorrectly scored as 21.
>Jim_Burlant: AAISTYZ C10 A..YA +16 235
#note I saw the obvious C1 ZIT and didn't like it - I felt it was too  likely to give up a WIZ/HAZE/GAZE/ADZ/DAZE comeback and put me deeper in the hole while, due to my WAN misfire the previous turn, I would still be saddled with the Y.  This dumps the Y, and potentially sets up the Z for ZA if I can draw an A, or something like ZEST 15A if he can't block. And I still have ZIT C1 as a backup.  Again, the sim and Championshp Player vary greatly in their opinions.  The sim says ZIT was the play and that this is horrendous, coughing up double digits of equity.  Championship Player says this wins 2% less often but is only a 4-point dog to 7F NAY.  In retrospect NAY looks better, but this sort of worked out for me.
>PH: ADINSU 15A UNSAID +33 293
#note Yeah, ok, I got burned...sort of.  It fished his S out and he only came back for 33.  But this could have been an awful lot worse.  And given my next rack, I certainly had good reason to believe this might have been my game.
>Jim_Burlant: AIINSTZ H1 SANITIZ. +104 339
#note Back in the driver's seat - 67% to win. I was pretty confident about this - he was sitting on more or less a random rack.
>PH: ?DEEILO 3G E.tOILED +68 361
#note Again - off his SIX tile draw.   Nothing plays on rows 1 or 2.  Other options for Paul are NIELLOED 3H (different placements of the blank) and 5H TOILETED. Interestingly enough, Quackle says that the bingo is not best here - Q says he should have played off OE F2 for 21.  I think Quackle is wrong here - what Q fails to understand is that a human opponent is going to immediately play defense and shut that down.  
>Jim_Burlant: HILOORR 2J HO +28 367
#note  Given the unseen pool, the better rack dumps like HILLO or HOLLO are unwise, since they potentially give back huge points with WHITE or HIVE. This scores, keeps me in the game, and doesn't give a whole lot back. Q says this is a very strong choice, but it claims I missed a better play: H1 (SANITIZE)R H1.   Really?  Can someone explain that one to me given that there is no bingo that is going to play anywhere on that board from that leave?
>PH: EI G8 .IE +12 373
>Jim_Burlant: BILORRV 2M ROB +18 385
#note What I wouldn't have given for a T (the most probable tile in the pool) - I saw LIROT 4K for 24 and possible game clincher...and I didn't have it. I saw REV 12M, and also noticed that with VEX as a possibility, I didn't need to worry about the V just now.   When I saw this, and saw that the A's were out (I double-checked that all 9 had been played), I knew this was safe and put it down as it scored well (I have no better scoring option) and it would keep the pressure on.  In principle, Q agrees, saying that it's either REV, RIB 2M,  or this.  RIB would have played the unseen tiles a little better and in retrospect, it would have won me the game, and you'll see why in a second.
>PH: EIILORT 4K LITER +26 399
#note This was his rack.  He saw TRIOLITE* and didn't like it, and he couldn't think of TROILITE.  But had I played RIB instead of ROB, he would have been limited to LIT K4 for 16 at best.  Instead, he still has this which is enough to give him the win because of my subsequent draw.
>Jim_Burlant: GILRTVW C1 WIT +24 409
#note Not that it really matters at this point, but I also had him mis-tracked as sitting on ILNO, not INOT.  This is best.
