#note Can't remember his last tile here.
>Noah: AAACFNU 12A FAUN +33 206
#note FAUCAL is the other option. FAUCAL does allow him to bingo more often, while this sets up some scoring options. Unfortuantely, unless he makes a play ending in F, he will take out both of the best scoring spots with one play, so setting up scoring spots here may not be an advantage. On the other hand, he will also bingo less after FAUN, and it scores a lot more points.
>Kolton: ?AEGOPT K2 POTAGEs +73 155
>Noah: AACCEIP 4F PICCA.A +32 238
#note I played this rather quickly, and perhaps should've considered CAPE and PACE. The main advantage of PICCATA is that it reduces Kolton's bingo chance a fair bit. It's also possible, though unlikely, that he will S hook it. I'm not sure how to compare these three plays.
>Kolton: ?AIMNOS 2H cAM.IONS +84 239
#note The best of four ?AMPIONS bingos!
>Noah: DELNOTT A10 LO.TED +30 268
#note I thought about TOLED 15A, LOFTED, and SLOTTED O2. I didn't consider TENFOLD A9. I don't love setting up an obvious X spot, as it takes no skill to use, but it's also true that there are already some good X spots on this board. I did LOFTED rather than TOLED because of plays to the F -- the difference seems slight. I didn't do SLOTTED because it didn't score as much and the bottom left scoring spot seemed quite good, indeed not as useful as column O. Quackle says TENFOLD is quite a bit better than LOFTED, because it scores more this turn AND the T scores more next turn. The thing you have to counterbalance this with is the no-skill X spot in a game where I really want to outplay. Yet it just might not be worth giving up TENFOLD when there are still 40-point X plays available. What do you think?
>Kolton: ENNW M11 WENN. +22 261
>Noah: GIJNOTU N10 JO +30 298
#note I found this play difficult. JO/JOT N10 and JINGO/JUNTO B6 were all on my radar. I liked JINGO better than JUNTO because it scored more and GI didn't seem good. I liked JO better than JOT beacuse GINTU seemed to go well with the S at O2 and at O11, plus it didn't set up the volatile (ET)H hook, plus it didn't seem like column O plays for him were too big. JINGO vs JO is a tougher decision. GINTU doesn't look awesome on this board (outside of bingos), and the extra five points of JINGO is definitely helpful. On the other hand, I think JO is more likely to lead to a filling of space on the right side of the board, leaving only the mediocre 5A bingo lane for Kolton to use if he wants to bingo. Of course, this could also happen next turn after JINGO, but it doesn't look quite as likely. JO makes Kolton's and my next play score better on average. I'm not sure what the best play here was.
>Kolton: BEGIR O11 GIBER +34 295
>Noah: EGINSTU 5A GUNITES +72 370
#note An excellent draw.
>Kolton: UX 3M XU +38 333
>Noah: HIIMNOR 6B HON +31 401
#note I got really anxious here, afraid that I might be missing a bingo for him either before (through GUNI) or after (through NO or IN) I made my play here. The only such bingo I saw was VETIVERT, and I was indeed correct in thinking it was the only bingo. Unfortunately, my paranoia had me play HON. NOH or OHM, or maybe leaving a tile in the bag with OH, probably give me more spread than HON does.
