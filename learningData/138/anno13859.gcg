>Matt_Canik: BBCEGOS 8G BOG +12 12
#note FUCK I spent so long on this rack and completely whiffed COBB/COBBS. 
>Greg_Stone: ADIOZ 9E AZIDO +29 29
>Matt_Canik: BCEOSSU E5 SCUB. +18 30
#note I spent a REALLY long time here. I thought SCUBA made my other S really valuable and made it really hard for him to score. Q still just wants me to play OBE 7G. He does score 3-4 less after SCUBA than OBE, though, so I was right about the defense. 
>Greg_Stone: GGL 7C GL.G +8 37
>Matt_Canik: EEHKNOS D2 HOKE +24 54
#note Again, trying to make my S more valuable instead of playing OKEH 10I. Q's got them right next to each other, slight edge to HOKE. 
>Greg_Stone: LOP C1 POL +19 56
>Matt_Canik: EEINRSX J2 REXINES +75 129
#note I think this was added with OSPD4, which explains the challenge. 
>Greg_Stone: ENW -  +0 56

>Greg_Stone: ENW 4H W..EN +38 94
>Matt_Canik: EENRSTV 10G NERVE +29 188
#note This was another play that was hard for me to make. Again, I'm trying to adjust away from 'defense/paranoia' to a more open feel. Old Matt would never make this play.

>Matt_Canik: AEIRSTU -U +0 223
#note (V)AU also seems like a decent option to open up the S hook. 
>Greg_Stone: ?INOSTT 12A TINpOTS +76 255
>Greg_Stone: ?INOSTT --  -76 179
#note I'm holding AEEIRST and have (Y)EASTIER for 86. As soon as he played this, I knew it was not a word, but it gives back TREATIES/TREATISE/ARIETTES for 122. I hold the play immediately, then stared for literally 8 minutes trying to decide the best course of action. TrITONS also plays 12A. I had seen him play at least one intentional phoney early in the tourney, so it's fairly likely that he was trying that again here and didn't see TRITONS. It should also be noted that spread is really important right now- we're both 4-0, I have about a 50 point edge on cume, but we're definitely playing again next round for the championship.

>Greg_Stone: DFF 11K D.FF +28 219
>Matt_Canik: EEEILOV C7 .LOVE +10 346
#note Clearly, the right play calls for me to play something like OLIVE/(SCUBA)E(D). But I didn't see that, and this kills off virtually every bingo chance he has. 
>Greg_Stone: NT 9K T.N +15 234
#note He spends a really long time here. 
>Matt_Canik: EEIINRU -EIU +0 346
#note I am sort of worried about getting Qed at O11, but given that I had just seen his rack a few turns prior it seemed really unlikely. I decide to just exchange, hold good tiles, and try to block anything he opens. (LO)UIE does the same thing, but picks up 6 points. Whoops. 
>Greg_Stone: ?AQSTU O11 SQUAT +84 318
#note Go figure. 
>Matt_Canik: EIMNORW N14 MI +18 364
#note Q has me winning around 68% here, but Q probably sucks at this type of situation. 
>Greg_Stone: ??AEEIR N10 E. +7 325
#note Said after that this was the rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ELNORUW O5 LU..N +7 371
#note I'm too afraid of opening something with a play like WORN/GLOVER and missing a potential bingo in the pool, so I take what I think is a safe option up here at the cost of a lot of spread.... except LUMIN* is not a word. Q says even after he challenges this off, he can't win... but damn that could have been costly. I need to learn my words better. 
>Greg_Stone: ??AEIJR 12A JERboA +52 377
>Matt_Canik: EORW N2 WORE +16 387
#note A hell of a game, some really cool positions. At times like this I really like being a Scrabble player, especially when I see just how much further I have to learn and just how many crazy situations this game can produce.
