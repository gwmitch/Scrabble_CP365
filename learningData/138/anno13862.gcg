>Bill: ABDHPRT H6 DRAB +14 14
#note Quackle wants me to play my leave.
>Steve: HIIL I8 HILI +18 18
>Bill: EHOOPTT G8 HOOT +23 37
#note Wow, missed PHOTO. Rousing start! I liked this better than the couple of plays I did see to the triple, for some asinine reason.
>Steve: IOPV 11C PIVO. +20 38
>Bill: DDEIKPT F10 D.PED +24 61
#note Couldn't remember for sure that KIP was a verb (which is terrible), and I was a little worried about the F10 spot.
>Steve: ISTZ D8 ZIT.S +48 86
>Bill: ABGIKST F2 KITBAGS +86 147
#note This wasn't a tough play to make - as the saying goes, KGB bingo finds you.
>Steve: ACEELNR -  +0 86
#note Lost challenge.
>Bill: EINORSU 4C ROU.INES +68 215
>Steve: ACEELNR 14A CALEN.ER +72 158
#note I don't know if RECLEAN was missed; that seems like it would be the better option if you're still behind.
>Bill: EIMOQWY H12 WI.Y +42 257
#note This was moronic, I obviously should've played WORM to save QIS. Didn't see OYEZ, but I think that leave's too ugly.
>Steve: ?AJ A12 JA.k +60 218
#note Apparently he already had the other blank at this point, not like I can infer it from this play.
>Bill: EFIMOOQ J2 QI. +32 289
#note Luckily got QIS back, though the leave is taking a turn for the worse.
>Steve: EEG 8A GEE. +42 260
#note He thought for a few minutes and seemed disappointed to make this play, which was a big hint that he did, indeed, have the other blank.
>Bill: EFMNNOO 3B FON +18 307
#note Saving MENO for next turn.
>Steve: VX C7 V.X +42 302
#note Starting to get frustrating - after the bingo-lost challenge-bingo sequence, he's power-tiled his way back into the game.
>Bill: AEEMNNO 2A MENO +28 335
>Steve: DELW 3I W.ELD +35 337
>Bill: AEELNNS G2 AN. +13 348
#note I tried to come up with some plan of action on this play, but I don't think opening would be a wise idea. I just have to hope that if he does have the blank, he has some of the junk, too.
>Steve: AMR 1G RAM +19 356
>Bill: EELNRSU 1A ER +24 372
#note Should've lost the game here by missing SULLENER.
>Steve: AFOT L2 A.OFT +16 372
>Bill: AEELNSU 6J LU.E +6 378
#note This isn't simming too bad. I felt like it maximized my bingo chances without helping him too much, but it scores so little that if I don't bingo there are plenty of way I can be outrun, even if I can put myself in position to go out first. FEU is simming well, even after I specifiy a blank for him, which seems wrong because he could just burn it to hook FEUs/FEUd from O1, leaving me little chance to bingo or make up the point difference. EAU sims best, and I think it is best - I think I rejected it because it sets up a lane for a bingo starting with T, which could be really helpful to him. Weighing all the possibilities, though, that's probably what I should've gone with.

#note Steve missed J9 sATIETY, but equally importantly, he mistracked. After not seeing any obviously stick-prone tiles out, he just said, "Well, it doesn't matter what you have; I have to bingo." That was quite a relief to me as I was experiencing the horrible realization that there was only one spot for my G. Not to be too hard on Steve (and hey, I hardly played well this game), but I think that's the first time I've seen a game lost that could've been won with either an outbingo or a stick sequence. The best G-stick that I could come up with is 68 points (including the points for the G). I'll put it in the next comment.
>Bill: G 11M G.. +4 450
#note 10N OI for 2 points --> 9G OBIT 6 --> 13A AT 4 --> 3I WIELDY 13 --> I1 MAWEd 22 --> 2I AQUAE 17 and out, 4 for G.
