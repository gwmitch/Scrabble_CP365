>Eric_Tran: ACEILNX 8H CALIX +44 44
#note ET: A few different X choices here: AXENIC XENIC XENIAL.  CALIX is best.  good leave, good defense.
>JD: EFIQRRW I7 F.QIR +31 31
>Eric_Tran: ELNNNOU L8 .ENON +24 68
#note ET: Not a good board to bingo on, so I take the pts with XENON instead of 9K NUN.
>JD: ENORSSW 12C WORSENS +90 121
#note jd: passing up a point not to hang the S in the triple lane
>Eric_Tran: ELNOTTU C9 OUT.ENT +22 90
#note ET: Saw H10 TENUTO and M9 TENUTO.  I was just worried that after a parallel play at 11 or 13, the whole top-left part of the board would be dead.  Wanted to force it open now.
>JD: ?ABCGJO K11 JOG +42 163
>Eric_Tran: FKLRSTV 10H K.F +18 108
#note ET: I'm so behind - need to exchange here. 
>JD: ?ABCDNP M9 DAB +27 190
>Eric_Tran: LLMRSTV G11 M.LL +7 115
#note JD: argh eric passes up 5 points because he somehow knows I have the 3x3.  ET: Pre-opening the board.  He is likely to play at 15A, so I'll need another line set up.  
>JD: ?ACINPT D4 CANTrIP +76 266
#note jd: SHOULD'VE PLAYED CATNIPS but I wanted to not create a lane on column B, of course the one point would've come in handy later...
>Eric_Tran: HRRSTUV 15A RU.H +33 148
#note ET: Better than THRUST.  I think I need that dangerous, tough-to-block bingo line.
>JD: AEEGRTV F6 GREAVE. +27 293
#note JD: I like this play with a big lead
>Eric_Tran: ?ERSSTV 15G STRiVES +87 235
#note ET: This or STARVES, to make the O-line more accessible
>JD: BDEIIOT 14L BIO +16 309
#note jd: all of my plays here suck, but I totally didn't realize that I was setting up a G hook here - just looking at the esses and blanks being gone. I shold just play KINO at H10 and wait for him to do something.
>Eric_Tran: AEILNYY 13M AY +21 256
#note jd: giving up a lot of points to do this...  ET: I thought almost certainly Jesse had the G on this play.  Else, he's needlessly creating a bingo line that wil be pretty tough to block.  I want to mess it up.  This also sets up my E - no guarantee he has a good comeback to this.  I also want to keep the A-line open, as I'll need a lot of pts and a bingo to catch up.  Sim likes B10 YE > B10 YA.  
>JD: ADEEIIT O8 IDEATE +30 339
#note jd: I can play ALIF here too but this shuts this lane down and gets the game over with much faster. the resulting bingo lane I'm creating is very weak with all of the esses gone. of course eric asks me right after I play this if my 7th tile is a G and I'm like...huh?
>Eric_Tran: EILNPRY B9 PYE +39 295
#note ET: Jesse has just opened a 2nd bingo line.  PYE is just so many points, I have to take it, even if it blocks the A line.
>JD: AIIIMOU J7 A.I. +23 362
#note jd: shutting down a couple of low-prob lanes in the process of scoring
>Eric_Tran: EHILNOR 4D .HLORINE +64 359
#note ET: This was helpful
>JD: AIIMOUU 3I MIAOU +31 393
#note jd: nice draw there, nothing to do but empty the bag and hope
>Eric_Tran: ADEGOTZ J2 Z..E +33 392
#note jd: nice idea by eric, he's supposed to lose but this is his second-best option - GIN at J2 threatens AZOTED to go out, but my block is easier to find - I just have to play UDO at L1.  ET: Completely missed just G(IN).  I saw his best sequence of WUD / (H)IE.  Reasoned that there was no good way to block it, so I just went about making my best play.  
>JD: DEIUW 5C W.E +22 415
#note jd: ugh, I saw WIDER, I saw the spot for HIE, but for some reason I never saw that WUD played at the bottom-left even though I had plenty of time. I had had a bad night's sleep and was having trouble focusing, but no excuses...I blew it. WUD first (since otherwise he can block it) and then I win even after GOAD. bah.
>Eric_Tran: ADGOT 1H GOAD +32 424
>JD: DIU 7A DUI. +6 421
#note jd: sigh
>JD:  (T) +2 423
