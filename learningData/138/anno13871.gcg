#note I sort of made this move on autopilot but for some reason I completely whiffed on WEEP, which must be better

#note saw dopamine, saw pandemic, completely whiffed on impawned. I actually didn't think impawn was good - I think I saw the 6 here but not the 8 and didn't think about it any further.

#note this is a pretty interesting move, I'm up by enough that opening the 3x3 must be one of the only ways I can lose, there's also both blanks remaining so he still has some firepower available. ultimately I'm enough of a favorite that it probably doesn't matter what I choose, but I actually agree with quackle's favorite of JUNTO at C9 - it drops his bingo percentage to 18% versus 26% after my placement of VINOUS, and it holds onto the S which could come in handy.

#note really interesting sims results, quackle loves blocking both of his 7s lanes at row 12 and 14 by playing JATOS and setting up the X for next turn in the process. It didn't occur to me at the time but I like it a lot.

#note BARD at C11 to set up his out is his best play
>JD: GIIKLOT 1G KILO +44 543
#note I just figured that taking the points had to be best, but actually playing GILT at 14F blocks both of his outs and saves KI for the top and sets up a nice out of KOI at 2M that he has to block by playing BEST. interesting.
