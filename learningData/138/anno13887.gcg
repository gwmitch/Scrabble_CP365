#note This seemed better than AETHER because the case A looks more useful than the case T here. It also seemed better than QAT, because she's almost certainly not going to win after this, and because I usually have at least 31 points for the Q next turn. I didn't see N9 sHATTER, but I really think I am supposed to block the 3x3.
