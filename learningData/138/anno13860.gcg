#note I know LEKU doesn't take an S, I assume he does too.

#note This blocks every 2x2 without giving anything back, whereas G(A)RDA gives back (D)ECIArES 2x2. This seems to do the most damage control, as only vESICAE plays after this, along with two 9s. Can you find them?

>Greg_Stone: ?ACEEIS 10B CA.E +14 30
#note CEAS(EF)IrE and CA(UT)ErIES. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEFNRS 7I SNARFED +77 162
#note I haven't been this unhappy about playing a bingo in a long time. Really scared of that 3x3 spot. (note that I only need to lose by less than 40 to win the tourney)
>Greg_Stone: ?EINSUV A4 UNVEIlS +87 117
#note ENVIoUS 2x2
>Matt_Canik: DHIMORT N5 TH.RMOID +74 236
#note Since I've dominated him on the challenge computer thus far, I feel pretty safe doing this. It wasn't even held. 
>Greg_Stone: IILP M2 PILI +14 131
>Matt_Canik: BDELNPU L1 LUBED +34 270
#note PULED scores two more and is better defensively. I just wish I knew words better. 
>Greg_Stone: ?EILNOT O9 ENTOILs +83 214
>Matt_Canik: DEJMNPU B1 JUMP +34 304
#note I'm getting really scared at this point- wide open board with a 2x2, a bingo line to an S, and a potentially huge J spot. I'm really uncomfortable the rest of this game, but I think I handled myself well. I guess we'll find out. 
>Greg_Stone: OOT C2 TOO +21 235
>Matt_Canik: ADEEHNY D1 YEANED +48 352
#note Wasn't sure between this and HYENA, but this sims 4 points above.

>Greg_Stone: AEGINRS 15H SERINGA. +77 331
>Matt_Canik: EEIOQWZ 11E WIZ +42 435
#note Killing the 2x2 all but guarantees me the tourney, and probably the game too. 
>Greg_Stone: EORTX B10 .ORTEX +30 361
>Matt_Canik: CEEGIOQ 15A E.EC +48 483
#note Should have seen QI(S) blocking VROW and holding either E(X)EC or (Y)OGEE. Oops.
