#note princess bride - "never get involved in a land war in asia". me - "never get involved in a shootout with carl johnson." I wanted to play ZERK or ZEK pretty bad to keep things tight but this is just too much better.

>JD: BIIMOQR J9 QI +28 368
#note I was really thinking about making a play like LIMBI to try to shut down carl's options, but again, I'm really not up that much and there will not be a better Q spot available down the road. so I let him take another shot on an open board.
>Farmer_Dick: ACEEIST B1 .IE +12 326
#note wow! he apparently passed up VESICATE to play VIE here! fascinating! maybe VICE is a good try for him here too since it scores a little more and I won't be able to play at A4 if it empties the bag and gives him an out-bingo?
>JD: BFIIMOR E8 .IMBI +18 386
#note urgh. the pool actually doesn't work that great at the spot carl just created, so I'm not sure I have a better shot other than blocking all the rest of the lanes. I completely missed BIFORM for 46 at A3, but I may still lose if carl bingoes out - in fact with his actual rack of ACEORST it would've been a tie! quackle's suggestion of IF at G12 is interesting but I don't like giving carl another chance to fish by leaving 3 in the bag, although there aren't really any more lanes he can create.
