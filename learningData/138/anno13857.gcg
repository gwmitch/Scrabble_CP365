#note Quackle really likes KHI N1 for 34. I'm not sure why... I guess it leaves L4 for the Z and oppt plays O1 a lot?

#note Q wants this at N1 instead too.

#note He wrote down his score before he played this, laid down all his tiles, said '88', hit his clock and immediately reached for the tile bag and pulled a tile out. I knew it was a word and didn't hold, but I don't think that's legal, much less ethical. Sure, he had the score written down first, but the procedures exist as they are currently for a reason. If this had been a word I wasn't sure of, I think I would have called the director on him... except he was the director. 
>Matt_Canik: EELMSTW A12 M.WL +36 242
#note Neat decision here between MEWL for 36 (EEST), WEEL for 33 (EMST), or MEW for 29 (ELST). Brief sim likes WEEL by less than a point. I thought with two Es left unseen it was fine to hold the extra one, but I guess I'm wrong.

#note Ooooh this is bad. I didn't even consider the bingo from the L (LENITIES). Slow down, Matt.

#note Aaand I realize right after I hit the clock that CIAO is a much better play at 4A. I hate myself sometimes.
