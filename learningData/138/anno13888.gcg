#note Also considered GANEV, but the X setup didn't seem strong enough, and this also did a little bet better job of making the top of the board hard to access.

#note The counterintuitive ICING looks grea here. Not only is the board position a bit less friendly to bingos, it scores more and keeps CNN, which isn't that much worse than GN in this case (one N left, only two Is left, not too much to do with GN here, etc.)

>Noah: AEJLLOP D4 JELL. +24 332
#note I found this play quite interesting. The options I considered were JELLO E2, JELLO D4, and JOE 2F. JOLE G3 is also a worthy option. I did this because a) it seemed to defend best against bingos and b) it set up a decent scoring spot. Unfortunately, it only does a) slightly better than JOE. The scoring spot JELLO sets up isn't fantastic, but I think I can expect to get a fairly consistent 25-35 there next turn, while I don't really care if Dave uses it, as I can then take down the right side of the board. I am okay with this play, but it's possible I should take the equity with JOE.
>Dr._Bing: AEK 13L KEA +27 237
>Noah: AOPRRUY E1 PAYOR +33 365
#note An interesting decision between this and PRY 12M. I played this because it has equity and because it doesn't seem like he bingos enough with KEAS to make PRY worth it. Even if he does bingo with KEAS, I likely win. This play looks better on spread.

>Noah: ABORRTU A11 TABOR +35 428
#note I thought this play was pretty interesting. It looked like TABOR won all the time -- even if he gets down BOTHERS O7 I still win. On the other hand, BRO deals with everything except maybe THEORBOS, and I'm guessing I still win after that. So it came down to spread. Even if he kept the nuts (EIRST) on his last rack, he only draws 6/21 big bingos (it's actually more because I didn't think of ANTIBUSER), and it's possible he kept something not quite as good. Thus I thought TABOR had to be worth it.
