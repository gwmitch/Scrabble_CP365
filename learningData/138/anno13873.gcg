#note FAVE? ANT is better than I thought, and it's more aggressive with scoring spots than FAVA. ANT doesn't have any high point tiles, but it goes well with them, and it seems lower entropy than ENT. I'm not really sure about this play though.

#note I considered EONIAN 2E and IRONE here. EON and JOE don't seem worth playing, as AEINT is pretty lame here. Unfortuantely, I overscored IRONE by two points, and may have also underscored EONIAN by a point, making IRONE seem clear. (The IRONE mistake was caught after it was played.) In reality, they both score 27. One thing EONIAN does better than IRONE is block lanes -- not great ones, but lines. I think that's an advantage in this position, so EONIAN looks better.

>Noah: ABEIIST 12A TIBIAE +26 269
#note Lots of options here. IBEX F3, INIA J4, TIBIAE/TIBIA 12A, BANI J3 and TIBIAS C3 are all worth a look. I think TIBIAE is better than TIBIAE because of the extra four and many Es in the pool. I think TIBIAE is better than TIBIAS because the S is very equitable post-TIBIAE, and TIBIAS just doesn't score enough to make up for that. BANI probably isn't enough points, and I don'tdig the BEST leave of INIA. TIBIAE beats IBEX in a sim -- probably because AEIST isn't great and turnover is with this pool, but I'm curious if anyone likes IBEX.

#note I also considered ERBIuMS, but thought this might be more likely to get a challenge. Strategically, what is your choice here? Does this decision matter?

#note Pretty stupid...I spaced on just KIP and realized I could've done it after hitting the clock. 
>Dean: EO F1 .OE +19 274
>Noah: AGHIRST F14 HA +33 420
#note LAIGH 4I is an option that could work out well with another bingo. I like my play because the bingo lane set up by LAIGH doesn't seem good enough to justify it, and the S is good for scoring with RECOUNTS on this board.

#note Oops, spaced and didn't realize this emptied the bag. OF/EF/FE looks pretty good. This sucks.
