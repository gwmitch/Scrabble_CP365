#note Quackle gives a slight advantage to 6F VA(U)
>Mike_Baker: IT J10 TI +8 18
#note Smells fishy

#note K1 WEaKONS- 91 , 13C SNOWl(I)KE- 88, and this are the only bingos
>Kolton_K: AADGHLR 14C LA.H +32 163
#note I was kind of scared to play this given that both C's and both F's are unseen, but Quackle agrees.
>Mike_Baker: Q 12D Q. +20 182
#note It's worth 21 at 13G haha
>Kolton_K: ADGNNRR 5J GNARR +19 182
#note This sims very closely with GRAND
>Mike_Baker: EEILNTY N1 ENTI.ELY +76 258
#note He put this down in column M first and announced his score, then said wait and slid it all over one spot. Hard to say which is better.
>Kolton_K: ACDIJNN K11 DJINN +32 214
#note A couple of plays sim better than this. Quackle likes just playing DJIN in the same spot for 30, possibly setting up the other N next turn. Next is L1 JNAN(A) which I whiffed on, then 10A DJIN(N)
>Mike_Baker: AHO O1 HAO +37 295
#note 8L HO(Y)A is 42 and O6 HAO is 40, but this blocks the 3x3 lane.
>Kolton_K: ACFIMOT O8 ATOMIC +48 262
#note O6 FOAM is 1 point better and CIT is more useful than F, but with a blank unseen I'll take the 6 tile turnover
>Mike_Baker: CIV B12 VIC. +38 333
#note Ugh. That was where my F was going to be useful
>Kolton_K: ?DFFLTW L4 W.FF +26 288
>Mike_Baker: ABELU 15J U.BALE +33 366
#note note: (ATOMIC)AL
>Kolton_K: ?DDLOST F3 TODDLeS +68 356
#note This puts me back in the game (and it's the only playable bingo).

>Mike_Baker: AERUU 3D AU.EUR +8 374
#note Mike spent a good 5 minutes on this turn. I thought he was trying to come up with something in column D, but apparently the U's were tripping him up. I don't know what his other letters were, but Quackle likes (J)EU a little more
>Kolton_K: EGGMORZ D2 G.ZER +30 386
#note I took a lot of time on this turn. There is one tile in the bag, I'm down 18, and I have some scoring opportunities. If I play GR(A)ZE at D1, it is likely that he has DIN(G)IER as a comeback and I'll be stuck with MOG and whatever tile is in the bag. 10L MOZ(O) for 35 is interesting, but H1 GE(U)M for 30 leaving GORZ apparently gives me a win 88% of the time, way above all the other choices. GR(U)M in the same spot is second (64%) and my choice is third (62%)
>Mike_Baker: DEEIINR 12K .IN +20 394
#note So this endgame is completely wacky. Neither Baker nor myself saw what Quackle plays out. This play of JIN (as well as 4 other plays) gives him a 100% chance of winning (if he plays it right). This sets up an out play at C6 (EIDER). I have to block that with either D8 OM or C5 MOO. If I play MOO, he can overlap down the B column (IRED) and just outrun me. If I play OM, he can play IRED at M7 and also outrun me. Luckily for me, neither of us saw this sequence.
>Kolton_K: GMOO N10 MO +24 410
>Mike_Baker: DEEIR I12 ID +19 413
#note Whew. He is blind to EIDER
