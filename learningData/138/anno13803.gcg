>Matthew_O'Connor: AEFIKNO H4 KNIFE +34 34
#note Just going to rewrite the game with my racks. I rewrote Joey's commentary too.
>Joey_Mallick: ADEGNOU 9G UDO +20 20
#note Joey: Scored as 21. Even so, DUNNAGE 5E is much better.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AABNNOO J5 ABOON +18 52
#note This is also best, and 3% better than anything else.
>Joey_Mallick: AEEGNNT K5 GEN +20 40
#note haha ANTE(N)N(A)E. Bottleneck at the top.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AAHMNRV L1 VARNA +28 80
#note VAN L4 sims slightly better.
>Joey_Mallick: ABELNTY 3I BLA.NEY +30 70
#note BYTAL(K) is better
>Matthew_O'Connor: CEHM O1 CH.ME +54 134
#note Can't remember the rack here.
>Joey_Mallick: NOOTTTX L7 OTTO +8 78
#note OX is slightly better.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADILOOV N5 OVOIDAL +73 207
#note Nothing else to consider.
>Joey_Mallick: EIINQTX G6 QI +29 107
#note Clearly best, nothing else to consider here.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AEGIMTZ O11 IMAGE +35 242
#note No 60 point Z bomb here. Figured I could save the Z for later. It worked out, and CP picks Image, but that doesn't guarantee it being the best play.
>Joey_Mallick: ?AEINTX 14H rETAXIN. +84 191
#note Best.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EHIRSTZ 15D ZITHER +89 331
#note This actually does sim best. The S is better to keep, and it gunks up the triple.
>Joey_Mallick: ?CEEPRW 4D WREC. +28 219
#note Certainly the best move here.
>Matthew_O'Connor: EFILSUU 13I FILES +51 382
#note The leave is ugly, but 51 points is 51 points. Sims best despite the ugly leave.
>Joey_Mallick: ?AAEGPT 10A PAGEAnT +63 282
#note Only bingo. Best

>Matthew_O'Connor: DIPRUUU A8 PU.U +24 406
#note Three things cross the 100 percent win barrier, anything that's not an exchange empties the bag beyond 7 and doesn't allow Joey to bingoo twice should win 100 percent of the time
>Joey_Mallick: DEIRSST 12A STRIDES +78 360
#note Joey: Scored as 80. I couldn't underscore more often or it would have started to look suspicious. CP seems to prefer disrates, not sure why.
>Matthew_O'Connor: DEIORUY L12 D..Y +38 444
#note best
>Joey_Mallick: JLRSW J11 WR..S +27 387
