#note Actual rack. Despite the floating R, DAAL or DALI sim better, as does the simple fish XI M7
>Andrew_Fisher: EEINNNW 11C NEW +36 230
#note Damn, with only one E played thus far it is clearly better to play ENEW in the same spot.

#note Pretty sure this was the rack. David was keen to keep an O for hooking at G3, but maybe it just has to be sacrificed (e.g. COW 12K, NOW 11K, both permitting the L-hook). 
>Andrew_Fisher: AAEKRTZ N10 ZE.RA +72 414
#note Thinking I had the game easily won, I plonked down ZEBRA although ZABETA scores more. For some reason ZEBRA sims a little better.
>Q: ??EIMOW O6 WhIlOM +42 342
#note Short of time and with a two-blank poser, David makes a rare bingo miss. WIFEDOM (which plays in three spots) would fall three short if played at O5.
