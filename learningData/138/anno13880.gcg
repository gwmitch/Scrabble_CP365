#note I guess JAW or JEUX are better. I undervalued CERSU a bit too much because the U is usually a hindrance.

#note I really felt I needed to ditch the Z here with QUU in the bag.. I preferred to play this here instead of N4 because it was just be to easy for my opponent to have a nice playback. Q likes ZOMBI, which is certainly risky but maybe is my best option.
