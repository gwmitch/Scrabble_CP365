>Dan_Goodwin: CEIRU H4 CURIE +20 20
>Noah: EEGLNTU 6G G.UE +7 7
#note I way overestimated ELNT so I chose this over LUGER. I also wasn't sure of UNGLUE, which is a good play her. I also missed GURNET and CULET, both ood plays. Not a great turn, though this play actually worked out marvelously.
>Dan_Goodwin: ?DIOOST 9G OSTeOID +69 89
#note Dan thought my play of GRUE was trying to bait a phony S hook, so he didn't play this as a double-double.
>Noah: EEJLNRT L5 JETL.NER +82 89
>Dan_Goodwin: ?FIKLRS 11G FLIcK.RS +78 167
#note Another big break, with SuRFLIKE and SeRFLIKE available.
>Noah: AGNOPSW 8K G.OWS +33 122
#note I don't know why, but I made this play instantly. I should've thought longer here and ended up play WAGON M2.
>Dan_Goodwin: NNOOOTY M2 TOYON +27 194
>Noah: ADHNOPP 7F PO.ND +20 142
#note I didn't like most of my options here, including PANTO, DOJO, and column N plays. HOPPED J2 is a decent alternative to this, though I like that this helps to open the left side of the board. 
>Dan_Goodwin: ACDNOTZ 10F ZA +37 231
>Noah: AABHIPR 8A RAPHIA +49 191
>Dan_Goodwin: CDHLNOT 2J CHO.T +32 263
>Noah: BINRVXY B6 BR.XY +31 222
>Dan_Goodwin: ADELNUU D8 .AULED +20 283
>Noah: AEEEINV C2 NIEVE +20 242
#note I thought about NIEVE and EAVE here and also about column H plays like LIEVE and LEAVE. Column H plays just seem criminally easy to beat, but it's possible that I should play them against Dan if I think he's literally not going to care at all about closing the board. I think this play is pretty good because I need a bingo to win and I don't think I'm sacrificing too much equity.
>Dan_Goodwin: ABEFNNU 4A FE.B +26 309
#note Tough play. BUNN D1 looks pretty good.
>Noah: AAAEILT A8 .EALIA +21 263
#note Thought about AREA but the AILT leave seemed fairly useless compared to the extra S draws.
>Dan_Goodwin: AIMNNRU A1 NAI. +21 330
#note LINUM looks good here.
>Noah: ADEMSTT C12 MAT +20 283
#note This seems correct to me.
>Dan_Goodwin: AMNQRUW N11 .QUAW +34 364
#note SWAM N11 is a pretty cool play here, and it looks like it is best. It doesn't empty the bag, and will counteract any of my bingos if he draws the I! 
>Noah: DEIOSTV 15A VOTED +36 319
#note Best is VIED...but only if he sees the star play. Otherwise this looks correct.
>Dan_Goodwin: EEGIMNR O14 ME +31 395
#note Dan's second best play. Can you find the best one?
>Noah: IS 13K IS +18 337
