#note 7th best play according to championship player (51.80%). I agree YTTRIA (54.63%) has the better leave, but I don't like to put my vowels in front of doubles on first turn.

#note Championship player likes the 4th ranked VIEW (41.61%) at 8F but not my play? Speedy player ranks them equally. FIB (45.84%) sims best, but has a horrible leave. Overall, it's a tough rack and hard to balance and score.
>Chris_Williams: ABINS 10F BASIN +25 55
>Me: BFGHINO 11I FOH +25 61
#note Not a bad choice at 6th (43.53%), but 11E is better and shows my lack of patience. FOB is better there (46.85%) because Quackle likes the leave better.

#note #1 play. Finally.

#note My play is 3rd at (47.88%), Quackle likes PUGREE at 1C (54.22%) and GULPER 1E (51.97). I saw the GULPER play but wanted to keep my R. I guess its better to just take the 6 extra points. I don't like PUGREE because of the leave. I like my E's.

#note My play is 2nd with (49.06%). METE sims slightly higher with (49.57%) even though it scores 1 less point. The leaves are similar, so perhaps it's due to the positioning of the play. Overall, not a bad play.

#note This is the play that loses the game for me. I missed my second and last bingo of the tournament, CHIMERE at N8 or 14E (85.28%, 81.59%). Speedy player ranks my play  5th; I agree that HEMIC is better than my play because of the defensive positioning, even though it scores less.

#note Chris blocks my bingo. At this point, I'm trying to keep the board open. I really want to keep my E for the HOPE hook if I can bingo. Missing RAVINED is a huge mistake here, because all of the words for that play score well, and they are certainly worth sacrificing an E. My choice is horrible here and is barely in the top 50.
>Chris_Williams: IQ O1 QI +37 301
>Me: EIIINOU -IIOU +0 241
#note This is actually the #1 play, but even Quackle does not like my chances of winning (5.45%), and my poor choice last turn continues to inflict pain. Not only have I lost momentum, but missing the RAVINED hook allowed him an easily profitable dump en route to balancing.

#note My play is 7th. Chris's bingo essentially closed the board and ends the game. At this point, AY (0.61%) and EX (0.30%) are probably best for scoring. NARY 15I scores well and blocks Chris from using the lower right triple; I prefer gambling and keeping the R to hook the next turn. RAINY 15K is good, but I was worried about a J being used for the bottom triple. YAR 15I is similar to NARY, but NIX N13 is just stupid, and the leave bonus that Quackle must be giving the play makes no sense based on board position.

#note My play is #2 (37.2). Quackle likes IXIA 2B (39.2) better for some reason. I like my play better.

#note #1 play here. (Sarcastic YAY!)
>Me:  (ILTU) +8 337
#note Average word play rank was about 7.25. All plays but LOID were in the top 7. Excluding that play, the average rank was about 3.55. The missed bingo in this game prevents this from being a well played game. While I was certainly outdrawn, this game was possibly winnable. Overall, I give myself a B-.
