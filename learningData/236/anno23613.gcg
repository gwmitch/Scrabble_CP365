#note Spent a long time here. There's a few hotspot on the board and this play creates quite a few more. I originally dismissed this play since it set up S(CREW) to a TWS, but between then and the end of my turn I forgot about the S hook. I would have played 4F PU(MI)CER had I seen it; I also failed to see N10 PR(E)CUT which will probably induce a TWS exchange.

>Charles_Reinke: ?ABFPTU 11E FUB +20 133
#note I don't think I realized that I could play FAB at L4 for twelve more points than this, but keeping the U significantly reduces my chances of hitting a row 15 bingo. But I'm down so I have to take the points.
>Thomas_Reinke: DESW 1H WEDS +34 194
>Charles_Reinke: ?AELPTU 2B PULsATE +75 208
#note I was hyped about EUcAL(Y)PT for half a second. Then I realized it didn't fit. 13A oUTLEAP here is six more points but I'm not sticking an O in that spot.
>Thomas_Reinke: AFS 15L FA.S +42 236
>Charles_Reinke: EEGILOT L3 ELEGIT +28 236
#note 3B ETOILE is cool, but not significantly better. Taking out the L4 hotspot should take precedence.
>Thomas_Reinke: IOR 8L .ORI +12 248
>Charles_Reinke: DEIKNOO 12A KOINE +33 269
#note H12 (N)OOK keeps a conventional bingoey leave, but the board is dead for sevens. However, this play gives up to much by putting the K in the TWS lane. 13B OINKED looks best.
>Thomas_Reinke: AIV A12 .IVA +33 281
>Charles_Reinke: DDEGLOO 13E DOG +22 291
#note Close between this and 13C DODO. Also worthy of consideration is M3 EDDO, which scores enough that I think I should play it even with the worse leave. Unfortunately, I can't make plays I don't see, and I also was not blessed with the gift of time travel so I could go back and rectify this minor mistake.

#note It seems like I should be playing on column A since Thomas will often have a ~30 point play there. However, Quackle tells me that A3 (L)ASHED only wins six percent of the time compared to 38% for this. I don't usually look at win percentages but I'm making an exception here since the percentages support my play so that means they're right.
>Thomas_Reinke: CNOR 4B CORN +30 381

#note Gives Thomas an out. Didn't feel like calculating the spread difference between this and H11 S(N)ED.
