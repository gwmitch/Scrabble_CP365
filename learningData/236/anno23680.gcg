>Avery: ADIKMNR --  -88 0
#note Greedy!
>John: EEFGSTY 8G FEY +18 18
#note Thanks to John for providing racks. Static prefers FEYEST here, though FEY is not a bad idea. I'd opt for FEYEST only because FEY doesn't take an S. A sim puts FEYEST ahead by about .4 win%.
>Avery: ADIKMNR 7I MINK +23 23
>John: BEGHIST 8K EIGHT +39 57
>Avery: ADIORSU O4 AUDI.ORS +60 83
>John: ?BEQRRS -BQR +0 57
#note QI for 31 easily - though static puts BuRQA at 4K higher than exchanging. QI is still my choice but this has to be better than burning the blank
>Avery: CIOX N11 OXIC +28 111
#note I didn't record my rack here
>John: ?ABERSS 9B BRAiSES +68 125
#note BEARS(KI)NS! or BRAvE(NE)SS. Plays at 6J or M11 also rank higher than this. This is the highest scoring bingo that isn't a 9
>Avery: AADDMNO M11 DAM +33 144
#note I can reach the G by playing GODDAM.
>John: EELLRTW D8 W.LLET +26 151
>Avery: AACDIOV 13B VA.IC +20 164
#note This play was tough. I considered AVOCA(DOS), ATAVIC (but wasn't 100% sure, even though I knew ATAVIST), VIOLA/VOILA at 11A, CO(AX), and this. I didn't mind the extended defense from this, even though the leave is unpalatable. But the C doesn't have much power on this board, which heavily skewed my thinking. This doesn't make it onto static but sims in the top 10 - I guess AVOCADOS isn't bad since the X is gone, but it still felt too risky. I think I'd play ATAVIC if I had been sure of it.
>John: EGIORRR 12L R.. +20 171
#note Good play by John - 12L is where I'm most likely to score. Though K5 OR(NE)RIER accomplishes this also. Static putds RAX second and ORNERIER first, and a sim keeps it that way.
>Avery: DENNOTT N2 TONNE +23 187
#note TENNO is also here, which is new and I didn't know.
>John: EGIORRR 2J GRIO. +10 181
#note Nice draw - M5 GREGO is really tough to see. ROVER is a good option since I'm not too likely to have drawn a 3x3. I like M1 RIG also, but dumping R's isn't a bad idea.
>Avery: DHLUUUZ M1 D.H +24 211
#note I should really be exchanging here. But I got fixated on the M3 scoring spot and didn't like having to pass. But this is such an awful leave that I should just get it over with as soon as possible.
>John: AAENNRR B11 RA.EN +16 197
#note Feels good to know I accurately predicted his leave from this, knowing he kept any of AERN, which included the R solely because of his RAX play. RAVEN's equity is pretty good, but L1 AIRN keeps the E and scores a bit more. NAR(KI)ER is also an interesting choice to open the board, and I think that's probably what John was going for with this.
>Avery: ALTUUUZ 8A ZA +37 248
#note AZU(KI) is way better than this. Though UNAU sims about evenly.
>John: AIIINRV 1G VINA +24 221
#note INVAR at the bottom. VINI(FE)RA is cool too. I might consider just VIA here, but it doesn't hurt to dump one more to hunt for the blank
>Avery: ELQTUUU 10H TUQUE +37 285
#note I'd say that's a pretty good draw to a leave of LTUUU.
>John: BIIJNPR -BIJP +0 221
#note I think he should really be playing at 11I here. 31 for NIP is too much to pass up. even weaker plays like 12A JAPE and K4 BRINE exceed the equity of exchanging. RIN on here isn't terrible considering that there's no duplicates of them left, but it's better to score some points and keep a high scoring letter.
>Avery: DGLOOUW A14 WO +26 311
>John: INOOPRT 6J PO +23 244
>Avery: DEGLOSU 3G GUDE +14 325
#note So stupid. I didn't even think about comebacks on row 2 after this. With 4 E's left and a blank, I got too paranoid about row 3, but with a 67 point lead, I'll likely be fine without having to block. A play like GLEG at M5 works well, though, and it's also CP's pick. To my surprise, GUDE is CP's 3rd pick behind 7B GO, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. 
>John: EEINORT 11I TIN +23 267
#note EEOR is so clunky with two E's and an O unseen. I'm not sure if he saw the MINKE possibilities, but ENO(KI) or REI(KI) are other improvements. He has to bingo to come back, and his odds are a lot lower with tihs
>Avery: BEFLOPS 4E FLOP +22 347
#note CP's pick
>John: ?AEEEOR 5E EAR +22 289
#note I feel like this could have even been won if TIN had been a different play. EGO/MINKE stills wins, especially since he's emptying here. I can't say I blame him for being frustrated here - rough drawing victimized us both this weekend.
>Avery: ABEILST 6F BEL +27 374
#note I was so fixated on the 7 anagrams of this rack that I didn't even look at the bottom for BASILECT! minus like sixty thousand equity
>John: ?EEJOY A10 JOY +28 317
#note Because I also give him JEzE(BEL)!
>Avery: AIST L1 A.TS +20 394
#note And he gives me an out! See if you can find it - it's a word many of us know but it's hard to find. This is best otherwise -12
>John: ?EE A5 jEE. +12 329
#note or ExEC at the bottom
>John:  (I) +2 331
