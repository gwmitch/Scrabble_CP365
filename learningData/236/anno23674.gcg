>Chuck: ALLMNOY 8G ALLONYM +82 82
>Avery: AANQSTU I2 QUANTA.S +70 70
#note This is phoney! QUINTAL is not an adjective - it's a unit of weight equal to 100 pounds! I feel like I weigh about 3 QUINTALS then.
>Chuck: ANOOPRT 7A PATROON +64 146
#note He said he felt like there may have been something better, and I agreed. Nothing scores more than this, though he has options underneath and above.
>Avery: EEFFISV 3F EFF.SIVE +92 162
#note I'd say that's a good way to salvage that rack.
>Chuck: ?ABDIJM B6 J.MB +31 177
#note He spent like 8 minutes here and said he had something like this and wasn't sure if there was a bingo. JIMPY at A4 is his best option, though I can see merit in this
>Avery: EILOPUW 2E OWE +32 194
#note I figured static would like this best, but I didn't know how to evaluate the resulting plays after something like JAMB. He spent about 8 minutes on it, and I figured he had a blank or other good letters. LOUPE, UPO, and LOWE were my main considerations. If he happened to have consonants, 2F was the biggest spot for them, and there wasn't a good reason to keep it open if all my plays leave subpar stuff. OWE is CP's pick.
>Chuck: AADD 1E DADA +34 211
#note Could have been worse, though this is a great way to score and dump subpar letters that could have been prevented.
>Avery: ILPRSUU N4 LUPUS +26 220
#note I debated between SIRUP 10B, USURP in that area, and my play. With him likely close to a bingo, there's no good reason to open a double-double lane. This is a lot safer, though it didn't matter
>Chuck: ?AGINRR E4 ARR.wING +82 293
#note He grabbed the blank sheet as soon as it was his turn, but spent a few minutes deciding what to play. Other choices that score 82 are ARMORING and RAZORING
>Avery: ACHIOOR A7 .OACH +52 272
>Chuck: ENTUX L1 UN.EXT +34 327
>Avery: EHIIIOR K5 OI +24 296
#note I think this is right, but I debated HERIOT C2 for some good time. 
>Chuck: BCDE 1K C.BED +30 357
#note He was already down to about 7 minutes here
>Avery: EGHIIKR D2 HIKE +46 342
>Chuck: EEGILOT 10A .EE +25 382
>Avery: EGIINRR A7 .....IER +16 358
#note I stand by this - I don't see many options coming from this board, so more openings is fine, even at the risk of him only fishing two last turn
>Chuck: GIILORT 2I .I +17 399
>Avery: EEGINRT 11E .REETING +70 428
#note Pretty nice draw there - much more defensive than METERING considering he's been fishing
>Chuck: GILORTW L10 I.G +10 409
>Avery: DORTVWZ H10 R.Z +22 450
#note Nothing seemed ideal. WIZ and ZIT were condierable, but I like this since it effectively blocks the E as well. I'm likely sunk anyway, and he probably has both the S and the blank. He did, but I ended up blocking EYEBOLTS, which I saw!
>Chuck: ?ELOSTY 14A .OYaLEST +74 483
>Chuck: ?ELOSTY --  -74 409
#note There's no bingo, but he does have winning sequences! Playing TOY first at C3 will win in addition to YENTE at C9. YESTER at C9 ties. He played TOY later, and I will admit I forgot YER was a word! This is a great buffer though for me
>Avery: ADIOTVW J10 V.D +15 465
#note I was low on time but I was sitll lazy. No reason to risk opening anything, but this is not the way to go
>Chuck: ?ELOSTY H10 ...zES +42 451
#note TOY first is still ideal
>Avery: AIOTW M12 OWT +15 480
>Chuck: LOTY C3 TOY +29 480
#note Scored as 28
>Avery: AI 14A .IA +6 486
>Avery:  (L) +2 488
#note Really sloppy endgame performance by me, but I think the luck bailed me out big time
