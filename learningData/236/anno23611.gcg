#note Relieved I didn't miss any bingos here.

>Charles_Reinke: ?AEENNT 13B NEoNATE +71 149
#note Sims almost exactly even with the higher-scoring B5 NEATENs. I thought that play gave up too much.

#note Didn't look familiar at all so I challenged. Nice play by Peter to get back in the game.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: ARRSSST 15G STAR +15 237
#note I think this was Peter's rack.
>Charles_Reinke: EILRVVZ K1 VIZ.R +34 257
#note Obviously it's better to play this at K1 but I played too quickly.

>Charles_Reinke: ADEPPTY 14I PATY +19 424
#note I totally missed 1H PEA(V)Y because I was so focused on blocking the easy hooks on STAR. I was temporarily blind to S(QUIRED); the presence of that hook makes blocking here less of a priority.

>Charles_Reinke: DEGILST B11 SI.G +27 476
#note B8 GIDS is what I put down first, but then I thought that opened too much (?????) so I changed to this without even realizing that I was setting up a huge E(SQUIRED) for way too many points. Luckily I had this game won even with this stupid play.
>Peter_Schmiedicke: I 8M I. +2 294
>Charles_Reinke: DEGHLTU L8 TEUGH +24 500
#note Now I should block ESQUIRED, BUT I STILL DON'T SEE IT! Plus, I can play TEUGH at 15A. Or I could play TEUGHL(Y). Or I could make this dumb play.
