#note Dan got away with a phoney here. I hardly blinked. 
btw, there are no 7-letter bingos in his rack, and only three (unavailable) 8-letter bingos.

#note cp likes 1F PUG, then PLUG. I considered those, but missed POUF, which is another option.

#note c3 (BOO)ZE liked by Q, is an offensive gambit. Didn't see it.

#note This SEZ a lot about Dan's leave.

#note Feels like I dodged a bullet here.
>Steve_Grob: AAIILNO 4K ALOIN +20 297
#note Tough decision here, and I took my time with it. Probably would have played LIANOI(D) if I was 100 percent certain it was good. CP likes NAOI at 4J. I decided to take ALOIN for the points, mostly.

#note Dan has one winning play. I'd rate this 9-out-of-10 on the difficulty scale. I won't spoil it for those who want to give it a try. I'll reveal the answer at the end.

As it is, this play made things difficult for me.
>Steve_Grob: AEEHORT B5 THEREO. +24 347
#note Several winning plays, all block Dan's two out-plays in row B. Quackle says B5 THEE is the best choice.
