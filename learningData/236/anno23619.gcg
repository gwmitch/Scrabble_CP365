>Joshua_Sokol: EEGORUV I6 EGER +32 66
#note I might want to keep the R here and play EGO, but I preferred to act like I was ahead by taking the points, thus making it more likely Jason will open a spot up for my horrible tiles I am keeping.
>Jason_Li: CCENORS 8F C... +6 48
#note cool fish. Jason said the normal play was 4D CROC(K), but who cares what the normal play is. Good thing I blocked CORNICES/CONCISER last turn
>Joshua_Sokol: GIIOOUV -GIIOOUV +0 66
#note Given his fish I can't really play OGIV(E), since it leaves the board dead after he bingos to S(CONE). Otherwise it would be worth it.
>Jason_Li: CEINORS 11A CRONIES +80 128
#note What bingo would you play, and where?
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIOSSW J4 BOWS +45 111
#note It seemed super close here between J4 BOWS and 10E OW(E)S. I think J4 BOW is far too fishy. I don't need to do that at this stage. If he has a bad rack, the game is even. Since the bag was slightly consonant-heavy I was fine scoring 3 more and keeping the slightly less balanced SEI over BISE.

>Jason_Li: AILP K3 PAIL +29 199
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEINSZ C3 uNSIZED +112 258
#note I was fairly sure this was good. There is something to be said about playing DENIZENS instead just in case I was making this up, or looking longer and seeing DEZINCS. Jason noticed my hesitation, I think, and challenged
>Jason_Li: FINO -  +0 199
>Joshua_Sokol: DINQTVW 6B Q. +31 289
#note I considered F10 W(E)ND for a short time, not long enough to see that W(E)NT was better than W(E)ND. WENT is also much better than this. I failed to consider that A) there were 4 U's out, so if Jason ends up blocking QI next turn (seems slightly less likely than a 40% chance or so), I will still be able to play it for a bunch in the next few turns. b) I can draw any of the remaining A's for a huge L1 QAID, but that's probably more likely than not to get blocked next turn.

>Jason_Li: AEHN D8 HEN.A +38 273
>Joshua_Sokol: DINTUVX F10 D.X +22 347
#note damn, missed 4C (N)UDNI(K). I only looked through there the next turn. This was silly. The X is good to keep here, and I am not closing this board, so there is no use sacrificing anything to attempt to. Mistake number two in a row, and this one is worse than the last, being coupled with the fact that IIIVUUUTTTTT are still out there, and I'm almost a 50/50 favorite to draw one of those duplicates, or maybe more!
>Jason_Li: BEL N1 BEL +28 301
>Joshua_Sokol: ADINTUV O1 ID +29 376
#note I knew PIALS* was phony but then I didn't. Being intimidated by Jason Li 101. I realized after the fact that VATU D1 was so much better.
>Jason_Li: I M2 ...I +8 309
>Joshua_Sokol: ANRTTUV D1 VATU +27 403
#note Lucky I can still play it, but it's possible I will get burned this time, a turn too late. 
>Jason_Li: ILOT 1D .OLTI +24 333
>Joshua_Sokol: EMNRTTU 2H TUM +13 416
#note Hated this position, but I got myself into it. I can't stop Jason from getting a bingo, so I have to do my best to outrun him. This is as good as anything
>Jason_Li: EGP 13C PEG +21 354
#note When he played HENNA I assumed HENNAE* was good. Just PENNAE. Good thing he played there now, because I would have played there myself if he hadn't and would have lost a turn, if I believe Jason's postgame analysis, and I do.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFNRSTV L6 SEV +20 436
#note All exchanges are supposedly better than playing, but this is definitely preferable. The only problem is if I draw all consonants, which, coupled with Jason having to make the perfect play next turn, to exploit a hopeful scenario of me being vowel-less, and then Jason getting a bingo right afterwards, seemed very unlikely. This has got to be the play. I basically outrun all of the bingos unless I draw no vowels.
>Jason_Li: ?AAAHTT 14A AHA +16 370
#note TATHATA plays, but definitely doesn't win. E4 THAT was a play I was going to suggest to Jason after the game, but it's hard to explain why it would be better. Was just intuitive. It scores more, does the same thing as AHA (forces me to block, which might mean using my only vowel, in which case Jason might be able to eke it out.
>Joshua_Sokol: EFNRRTU 15A RETURN +37 473
#note I was pretty sure TURFER* was a word. But I thought better of it and played a word I was 100% on. Good thing... RERUN allows fewer bingos, so might be better than this. Oh wait, no it doesn't
>Jason_Li: ?AEGRTT N5 TARGETs +63 433
#note RETURNTARGETs was placed on the board, which would have won by 2. I would have had to risk a challenge on that one. Jason misses (G)R(R) here for a 69-point REGATTA at 14E
