#note Doubted FORME so I stuck the extra E on. Has the bonus of possibly baiting a phony S hook. Quackle likes G8 FEM which I somehow missed.

>Charles_Reinke: ACINNRW 11B WARNIN. +22 64
#note Sims about even with CAWIN(G) and AWNIN(G), which explains why I couldn't decide between the three. I was fairly confident that I wasn't giving Steve any letters that would bingo with AINSSTU.
>Steve_Hartsman: AINSSTU K10 UT +12 23
#note I don't usually comment on my opponent's plays, but it's worth noting that Steve should probably get rid of one of his S's here since it's not helping him bingo more than the T is, and I already know he has two of them. Is this what they call a "teachable moment"? I bet it is!

#note L3 TWAT is the same amount of points but HT? is clearly superior to TT?. Oops.

>Charles_Reinke: ?DEHLTT M6 wH.TTLED +91 275
#note MUNT*. I doubted it but decided I had the psychological upper hand. What is MUNTING anyway? Probably something stupid. Best real play might be to just drop the H at L3.
>Steve_Hartsman: BEEP L12 BEEP +33 119
>Charles_Reinke: AEIINTV 15L .INA +18 293
#note Obviously I need to play here. It's between PINA and PAVE. I didn't like the duplicate I's left over after PAVE so I sacrificed nine points to do this. Might be a minor mistake.
>Steve_Hartsman: ELNRSSU G2 RUNLESS +64 183
>Charles_Reinke: EGIOTTV 4C VOTI.G +24 317
#note Haven't yet internalized the BANC->BANCO hook. Quackle suggests 14B VOGIE but this is perfectly fine.
>Steve_Hartsman: OX 10E OX +52 235
>Charles_Reinke: EEKMTUY 4J M.TE +25 342
#note I thought I screwed up by passing on MOTEY in the same spot (wasn't 100% on it), but keeping YE for 28 easy points at F6 has its merits. So only a minor screwup.
>Steve_Hartsman: ?DEIIRS 14A InSIDER +77 312
>Charles_Reinke: AEKORUY A13 O.K +21 363
#note Suddenly Steve is within striking distance. The Q and Z are unseen. There are too many bad things that can happen in and around the bottom-left TWS so I have to block (missing KE(I)R, which gives me a bigger cushion).
>Steve_Hartsman: ADZ 6D ADZ. +34 346
>Charles_Reinke: AEOPRUY 2B YAUPE. +26 389
#note Thought I was Q-sticking him. Nope. Missed QU(A) in the bottom-right. Good thing it didn't matter.
