>Matt_Canik: AIJNRSS H7 JAR +20 20
#note Realized this was a mistake as soon as I played it. While JAR takes a back S, AJAR does not. While RAJ does not take a back S, RAJA does. I think I should have played RAJ. Or maybe JIN. 

Q actually wants me to play JARS by just a smidge...
>Ken_Kasney: COO I5 COO +16 16
>Matt_Canik: ABINNSS J7 BANI +20 40
#note Interesting position here. The standard equity play is BASIN/JARS, but two other options stand out for being "defensively offensive" - JOB/BANI and JOB/BANS. JOB/BANI makes the board very strong for esses and leaves me with two esses. The plan would be to cash one next turn and hold another one for later. 
JOB/BANS does the same thing but only holds one S - the flipside is that I get to bingo 10% more often next turn. BANS wins a sim by about 3-4 points but I'm not totally convinced it's the right thing to do. 
>Ken_Kasney: ADDEITU K8 AUDITED +75 91
>Matt_Canik: HILNPSS 13I PL.NISH +30 70
#note On this turn, I learned many new words... SPIL(T)H, HISP(ID), PLIN(T)H are all new to me! I wanted to try and hold the H for L8 but I couldn't find a decent way to. 
>Ken_Kasney: EOPRT O10 POT.ER +36 127
>Matt_Canik: BENSSTY 10E BYES +28 98
#note Should easily just be BYS in hindsight
>Ken_Kasney: AHM N11 MA.H +34 161
>Matt_Canik: KLMNSTX M12 K.T +20 118
#note Would have played L(Y)NX had I seen it - it's slightly below  K(I)T. Don't think this quite warrants an exchange, especially with a 28:26 C:V ratio
>Ken_Kasney: EFLT L6 FELT +15 176
>Matt_Canik: ALMNSSX M5 MAX +42 160
#note Close call! MAX or LAX?
>Ken_Kasney: IIIOO -IIIOO +0 176
>Matt_Canik: ELNORSS N2 LONER +26 186
#note I'm garbage with two esses. I should just play LENOS here but I feel so empowered holding the last two at the same time (even though this board is now horrible for esses). Ugh. 
>Ken_Kasney: ?CEIRTW F3 WITChER. +71 247
>Matt_Canik: ?AESSUU 2M U.U +3 189
#note I hate this play but all the others suck more. The 1 row is not a good line after this but it's scary enough that some opponents will block it anyway. Also, I can strengthen it by playing an underlap in the 3 row later (making ?UN hooks for me or something). USE at O4 is probably best I guess
