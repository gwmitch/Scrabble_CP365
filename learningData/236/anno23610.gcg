#note There are almst no reasonable plays that keep the S.

>Charles_Reinke: AMMNOOZ 4H ..MON +28 95
#note 8J AMMONO. New word for me. Gotta learn the sixes before Nationals. E3 ZOOM(A)N(I)A is cool but too risky. I can pretend I saw it and nobody will be any the wiser since it's the wrong play. Yeah. Let's do that.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEK J2 KA.E +30 117
#note I think Marty was down to around twelve minutes after making this play.

>Charles_Reinke: ?ALOSWZ F9 .ZO +32 161
#note Either this or 10B ZA. In some situations it would be wise to open up a double-double while holding the blank, but here it immediately creates the best scoring spot on the board by a long shot, so the 2x2 will always get blocked.

>Charles_Reinke: ALRTUUY 15K TRULY +29 309
#note Didn't see LYART, which is nine points better but keeps UU instead of AU. Other cool plays: FUTURAL, HAMAUL, HAMULAR.
>Marty_Gabriel: EGGIU 13K GIGUE +18 278
>Charles_Reinke: AAELRTU O6 LAUREAT. +77 386
#note AUREATELY obviously. Anybody could have seen that.
>Marty_Gabriel: BY N10 BY +28 306
>Charles_Reinke: ADEEHOR 14B HAE +29 415
#note Should tack on the D for six more.
>Marty_Gabriel: X 13H .X +34 340
>Charles_Reinke: CDEIORT N4 COED +16 431
#note Me being paranoid about bingos. 13A DOC is the obvious equity play but this play almost guarantees the win.
>Marty_Gabriel: DO 13B OD +20 360
>Charles_Reinke: IIRSTVW A10 WITS +12 443
#note A10 WRIST(s). Forgot about THAE. WRITS or WRIST at A9 are also much better, since I only have one spot to go out with IRV.
