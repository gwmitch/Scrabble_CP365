#note So after spending five minutes on INDIUM, I get this dreck. And Allan fishes off one tile opening a primo lane. I need to block this somehow.....
>Allan_Simmons: AF F10 FA +28 301
#note Allan had INFLATE or something like that, he said after the game, which OI successfully blocked.
>Spherulitic: ACEEGIL B10 CALIG. +30 336
#note This time I blocked Allan's CLEATING on A column.

>Spherulitic: EEIPRTU 1B PI.TURE +33 369
#note Part of me wondered if Allan kept the Q playing CLINE. There are exactly seven in the bag, so if I play six, then if he cashes the Q for 40+, he'll be left with six tiles and I won't have to worry about an outbingo. 

In retrospect, I think the better play is RECEIPT which leaves the U in case the Q is in the bag. 
>Allan_Simmons: ?ABEEGT B1 .E +8 331
#note Allan was hoping for an L or an S for the bing in L column. Q says he's drawing dead no matter what's in the bag.
