#note CHOPIN 5H looks good here, since Michael doesn't know CHOPINE. I didn't know CHOPIN although I considered it. Works out for both of us. This was dangerous but I was already down by a lot which prompted me to play it. Probably the wrong thing to do. 5C V(R)OW looks decent.
>Michael: OOSTY 13C SOOTY +50 190
>Josh: EIINRVX 5H .ERVIX +36 97
#note An interesting position as I should probably be maximizing volatility with a strong leave. But how do I go about doing that? 14E XI doesn't accomplish anything for me as I have no O and no Y to underlap. On the other hand, C3 XI looks decent as I have the right letters to overlap. It kind of messes with my bingo percentage as the E in MEDICINE looks like the best line for me. I would have to draw a lucky 7 to bingo next turn most of the time. I guess this is good enough. Another option is C1 VINIER.
>Michael: DEGLNOR 2B GOLDEN.R +74 264
>Josh: ?IINNSU 6M IN +13 110
#note Looked for a while here in vain. D12 I(O)N looks better than this. Didn't want to get jabbed by the Q by playing NI(X), this turn or later on.
>Michael: ADQ 6F QA.D +37 301
#note speak of the devil
>Josh: ?INSTUU O4 UNSUITs +74 184
#note only two in here are SUBUNIT and SUNSUIT. I thought of FUNSUIT but not SUNSUIT or SUBUNIT. No biggie
>Michael: CEHU F6 .U.CHE +28 329
>Josh: EEGNORV M3 VE..NG +36 220
#note thought he blocked OVERGONE*. 11E R(E)VENGE is the other option. I missed it but it takes out too much stuff to be much better than this
>Michael: AAEILOS B9 AA +17 346
#note Real rack, G1 A(N)OA seems like the best play. He almost put on the L for defense but decided against it.
>Josh: EEIKOOR A10 ROOKIE +39 259
>Michael: DEILOSU 10N U. +3 349
#note D(E)LOUSE looks right even though this fish hits like 75% of the time. 9H DUO is good too but Michael didn't know MEDICINED
>Josh: AEGJLMT 1A JAM +43 302
#note I wanted to play JAG at first but I didn't think there was much of a difference in bingo potential. I was wrong. I also could have played M(E)LTAGE to rush for the blank, but I thought he had it based on his last play until he obviously drew it based on his reaction. So maybe M10 JETLAG is way too risky given that. I'm baffled that I'm 8% more to bingo with MELT than with GELT. That's insane. G's are so bad.
>Michael: ?DEILOS 1H .ELODIaS +88 437
#note As he announced an A as the blank I though "now I have to hold and probably challenge even though I'm 99% sure it's good"
I think I can't win if it's good due to the pool and the board so I challenge. Bleh.
>Josh: AEGLSTT -  +0 302
>Michael: AWY 3A YAW +38 475
#note here he takes what I thought was my best spot. 
>Josh: AEGLSTT 4G G.T +8 310
#note But I just didn't move my letters around enough to see my bingo. There isn't much of a difference between bingoing and playing what I played anyhow. I'm probably gonna bingo next turn or the turn after for more than 68. Whatever, the game is lost anyway, only 6 in the pool. FWIW G(I)T sims better than GESTALT
>Michael: FO E10 OF +25 500
>Josh: AAELRST F13 .A +4 314
#note spent forever cause I thought there was something in this rack. I don't know why 4L A(E) yields more bingos for me than my play. I guess cause of 12G. I saw this gave me a ton of bingos so I played it
>Michael: AILNPTT 15F PLAINT +29 529
#note N10 U(T) to block double B bingos and threaten his own, but PLIANT instead cause it doesn't take an S. 
>Josh: ABELRST 12G BLASTER +77 391
#note But I had already forgotten the third in BLASTER/STABLER. I almost played TABLERS but it seemed off. It's indeed just LABRETS.
>Josh:  (BT) +8 399
