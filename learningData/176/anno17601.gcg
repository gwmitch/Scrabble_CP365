>Maureen_Morris: UUU -UUU +0 0
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIIOSV 8H OBIA +12 12
#note Maybe I should have stuck with VIA, I'm more likely to score with the B next turn.
>Maureen_Morris: AMX 7H MAX +31 31
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIINSV 9D VINIC +18 30
#note VI(A) should have been the obvious play, but even CIVIES for 32 is probably better than VINIC.
>Maureen_Morris: DERW E8 W.RED +18 49
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNRRS I5 DR.. +7 37
#note If I'm going to do this, I might as well just play R(E)ND for 5 instead. I'm not scoring either way so I want to make sure my dump actually turns my rack around. D11 plays seem a little risky even though I do have an S.
>Maureen_Morris: FNO D11 FON +23 72
>Matthew_Larocque: EHLNRSS 9J SH +20 57
#note Maybe take the extra points for HERLS/LEHRS at L4?
>Maureen_Morris: ?EIIRST L9 aIRIEST +69 141
>Matthew_Larocque: DELLNRS 13K D.LL +10 67
#note Now I'm really far behind so I make the desperate s hook.
>Maureen_Morris: AELOZ 15G ZEALO. +45 186
>Matthew_Larocque: ACENRRS O7 CRANERS +86 153
#note Not a word, but seemed likely to stay on.
>Maureen_Morris: EK N12 E.K +16 202
>Matthew_Larocque: AGNNTTU M6 TUNG +17 170
#note Didn't know GUTTA, which scores more than anything else. Seems Q also likes keeping NG together to go for the ING bingo hooking SHA.
>Maureen_Morris: AEHIL 5D HAILE. +20 222
>Matthew_Larocque: AGINOOT 4B GOO +18 188
#note Missed GITANO for 32. 
>Maureen_Morris: EIV L4 VIE +14 236
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINQTY 14B QAT +31 219
#note With the lack of Is I tried to get the most out of the Q down here.
>Maureen_Morris: ERY C12 YE.R +25 261
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEINUY 11J EY.E +14 233
#note Annoying rack, kind of wanted to exchange. Or played YU(L)E which I even saw. I'm not in good shape either way.
>Maureen_Morris: AGO 3B AGO +23 284
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIMNU 15A MI. +26 259
#note NEUM(E) I didn't know. IM(AG)INE.....there's enough high scoring letters in the bag that she'll keep well ahead of me.
>Maureen_Morris: APT 2B TAP +31 315
#note Well that's not good.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINUW H1 NEWI. +27 286
>Maureen_Morris: JO 2F JO. +26 341
>Matthew_Larocque: AEPTUUU 10N U. +4 290
#note And that draw was even worse.....
>Maureen_Morris: ?BDFNST 4B ...F +13 354
#note Scored as 16...
>Matthew_Larocque: AEOPTUU 14I TAU. +16 306
>Maureen_Morris: ?BDNST 5K D.S +14 368
>Matthew_Larocque: EOPU F7 PO.E +17 323
>Maureen_Morris: ?BNT 12H TaN +5 373
#note There must have been a B in the bag that wasn't drawn..... I lost 10 on time as well. I think those early racks hindered me a little too much, perhaps less consonant dumping would have helped.
