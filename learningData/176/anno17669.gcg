#note PROA and exchange OOOR are dead even. PROA is the best defensive play I have, but exchanging is a couple of points better on D and is much more likely to bingo. I guess I like the more proactive block in case VID was intended as a setup.

#note difficult decision with a clear winner according to quackle. I thought about plays like FUCKER, EX, FLUX and FLECK, but the winner is FLUNK at N6 which I didn't really consider because I thought it allowed for too big of a response on the right-hand TWS. I think the answer is that the X is a pretty good tile on this board with the potential to score 50 plus (expected score next turn is 47 versus 35 after EX). I can see how EX is pretty weak for rack-building, but so many easy plays went through that board quadrant that I figured I would try to cut them down. FLUNK sims 3 points up on FUCKER and EX.

#note I could play MIREX to open more, but with a garbage leave - and peter is quite likely to play there. figured I'd get into the bag instead. unfortunately this play would lead to my downfall

#note awful play, 4 Es left and I didn't create any lanes for myself. RENAME is the play

#note I was thinking that IGNITE top-left (or maybe at 3C to set up LIGNITE) gave me some vital lanes and a shot at drawing into a bingo out of the great pool, but then I became convinced that VEXINGS# was a word (had seen it while studying csw). one of the IGNITEs gives me a real chance to win since I have a 1/3 chance of bingoing next turn, so this was a sizeable error
>Peter: GO 14N GO +17 378
#note presumably this means he has the blank
>JD: EGIINST 1A IGNITE +26 336
#note as the tiles lay it turns out that I had no winning chances anyway, this was just desperation hoping to draw something that fit in two places. the last tiles in the bag were AADDEIOT which was not going to do much (5% winning chance if I play IGNITE instead of VEXINGS# last turn)
