#note Must stop leaving more vowels than consonants.  Even just dumping the E sims better than this, although there are some plays that sim better than this like LI/QI or PI/QI that don't make sense to me.  LEI I like a lot in spite of the danger of putting an E there...

#note Didn't know any of the words that simmed better (POMELO, COMPO, COELOME, COELOM), but COMPILE/PERIL is better than this even though it simmed worse (and it was slicker, and would have kept him from bingoing...)

#note Wow, I am really bad at identifying which words usually used as nouns are actually TWL verbs.  I make those errors repeatedly and was surprised to see that enclave took a d.  I don't care.  I still like this better.  Shutting down bingos on column L is stupid in my position.  Of course, I'm shutting down row 10 bingos here and making row 14 bingos much harder, so I probably should go for points, which I might have had I thought of enclaved.

#note Massive fail, and such an obvious one no less.  Either ZIT or doing anything to dump the A and I...  No idea what that was about, but I wish I could stop making such fundamental errors that I KNOW are wrong when I think about them.

#note Once I saw TIPI on the list of possibilities before I began simming, I knew that was the play.  That's how it goes for me.  I look at the best plays and go "Oh duh, oh duh, oh duh..."

>Sean_Wrona: AEIINOS 3G OI. +4 228
#note Is there anybody who would just take the points here with NISI leaving AEO (just like you're "supposed" to)?  I would not feel comfortable with that at all.  I know a fish like this is bad since it doesn't create a spot, but I think the OIs on row 13 and 15 (even though they sim better) are worse since they actively block spots through the D and E and through the D that I could actually use, and would pretty much shut down anything unless I drew an L.  As it turned out, I DID draw the L, played TOENAILS on the next turn, but he also bingoed through the D and E, so as it turns out OI/OD is probably what I needed to do for what I draw, but I just can't imagine blocking most of the remaining lines unless I already had the L.  I'm far more likely to draw an R than an L, and if I do, I haven't opened anything at all after any OI.

I suppose NISI can work out BECAUSE there are so many r's left and I could play something like ORRA/DO on the next turn but that isn't something I would even think of doing...

AGIO/BANI (had I found it) is totally the play I like...

#note Nice find.  Even in my thousands of online games, I STILL haven't found a disconnected 9 ever and it's one of the things that irks me most.  Even more after Chris Lipe played another one against me later the same day...
>Sean_Wrona: AEILNOS O1 .OENAILS +77 305
#note I was a bit surprised that ISLED actually simmed slightly higher than TOENAILS (and also that ISLED was a word, even though I've seen all the 5s).  I guess I get it.  Leaving ano with all those e's and r's left means I'd have a fairly strong chance of drawing something that could hit either column N or O but wouldn't Ted just shut down that part of the board anyway?  Yeah, he would.  He doesn't choke as often as I have I would assume given his greater experience.  I think I need to score now when the spot is still open and I could still get some big plays if I draw the S and/or X.  I'm not sure anyone would actually say ISLED is the best play.

>Sean_Wrona: BEERSTX 15F BEST +50 355
#note Hahaha, I saw BEST but missed BESTED, which would have put me down by only a point.  I obviously need to play BESTED (the regular sim said BEST was the BEST play - what?  Okay, I guess championship player is all that's valid at this point...yes, I already knew that.)  Even if I don't draw a vowel, it would be hard for him to block both EX and XI.

Championship player gives me a 25% chance of winning, so that must mean drawing the E or the blank for REX/JUTE after BESTED is my only shot.  Since I drew the N, the game was lost anyway.  At least that pleases me.  It technically wasn't a choke based on what I drew!
