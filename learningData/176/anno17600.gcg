#note I know the U is silent, but you still have to include it in the word, Ben.
>Matthew_Larocque: HLMNOPW H4 WHOMP +38 38

>Ben_Settle: AEEHRST 12D .EATHERS +65 151
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIKPRY H12 .AIK +33 132
#note I have a lot of places to score here, so keeping some high point letters should allow me to score well for a few turns. Too bad I missed out on PLEATHERS though. I had no idea WALKYRIE was an alternate to VALKYRIE.

>Matthew_Larocque: CEEPRXY 11C C.Y +26 158
#note Still missing the P hook as well as some other good plays like CREEPY or EXPIRY. I don't think this is terrible or anything though.
>Ben_Settle: ACIO L6 CIAO +11 182
#note Ben misses/doesn't know AZONAL which is good for me.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIPRRX I11 R.X +35 193

>Matthew_Larocque: DEFGIOV M7 FIG +32 374
#note I don't get why FIDO would sim better. I'd rather dump the G and FIDO sets up a hotspot for no reason.
>Ben_Settle: LTW L1 W.LT +22 232
#note Scored as... 14?
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNOTV N4 DOL +15 389
