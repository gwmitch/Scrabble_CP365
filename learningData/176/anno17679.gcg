#note Trying Collins# at club. We're allowed a cheat sheet with 2s/3s/JQXZ 4s, plus some vowel dumps. 
>Matt_Canik: AEFGNOR 8H GANOF +26 26
#note I miss FANGO# here. Ok.

>Matt_Canik: AAAEIRU C2 A.UARIA +17 222
#note I saw this and AUA J4. This seems like an inferior play because it opens so much new stuff up, but I really didn't want to get caught up holding vowels. 
>Becky_Dyer: ?AENSTY D7 STAYNEd +75 192
#note ENTAYlES# would have been killer. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ABEIRS M2 BARItES +78 300
#note AScRIBE is the only play along M with overlaps that I'd know (also ARABISE#), and I miss the lovely A(X)EBIRdS for 99. 
This closed off a lot of the board though. 
>Becky_Dyer: OVW B8 VOW +23 215
>Matt_Canik: AFINUV 1D FAUV. +15 315
#note I don't remember the last tile here, but I wanted to clean up the rack and block that E. A9 is much more dangerous but I didn't see a play there. Becky has also sighed with her draw after VOW so I'm not overly worried about a bingo.

#note mmm, this was a really pretty fit. R(O)L(A)G# is apparently a word in this dictionary.
