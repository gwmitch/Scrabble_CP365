>Nicky_Deco: IVYZ 7C VIZY +28 28
>Spherulitic: ADEEENV 9C VADE +18 26
#note This move is a pretty big mistake, actually.
>Nicky_Deco: BFU 7H FUB +14 42

>Nicky_Deco: ?EIOTUW 9H WIpEOUT +70 112
>Spherulitic: BEEENQT L4 BEENT. +18 74
#note Q actually likes QUEEN. That's not happening. Any play other than BEENTO can easily leave me down by more than a bingo if Nicky has hit L8. 
>Nicky_Deco: ILO M3 OIL +12 124

>Nicky_Deco: ?AEIILS O5 LIAISEd +78 202
>Spherulitic: ENNPRST M9 .NPEN +14 119
#note Q likes FAWN as if Nicky wouldn't block the lane next turn. How quaint, Q.

>Nicky_Deco: JW H13 J.W +39 257
>Spherulitic: EGINORT E5 RE. +24 210
>Nicky_Deco: CDU 5C CU.D +7 264
#note This is a game of Burrito where I only have one lane. Except for the K. If I can hit the K, I'll win. (Spoiler alert: there's no way I hit the K the way this tournament has gone.)
>Spherulitic: DGINORT 4E TONG +23 233
#note TONG with the hopes that she might play down at H1 giving me one shot at a bing.
>Nicky_Deco: AEGMORS 11K MO.E. +28 292
>Spherulitic: DHINORT H1 HON. +24 257
#note If it's my day I'll hit KERATOID or something. Need to stay in range so a bing would matter.
>Nicky_Deco: AAEGORS G1 AGE. +17 309
>Spherulitic: AADIORT 13F RA. +14 271
#note Not RAJA, I think.
