#note B14 FA is simming best here, it likes me taking a chance with LIMPS as a leave.. (-2.5)

#note i want to keep up the pressure, but maybe BLAB is best because of the leave and it doesn't score too badly. CITABLE 13G is another good choice. this is a tough move. (-0.5)

#note i stand by BAH here instead of G12 RIB, for obvious reasons.

>cesar: DIRRSTY 14G D.TY +16 370
#note this is however the wrong move, with only a 50% win chance. 14B RETRY is the obvious move here and seems to win the most at 75%. somehow i'd deluded myself into thinking i couldn't lose this game, but DUTY opens up so many bad possibilities! EXCISe is 56 which would basically give him the win.

#note luckily, he didn't see my out-play, although i win with a bunch of other stuff too.
