#note idea clearly way better, just got fixated on playing the H for some reason
>Doug_Brockmeier: FOY H13 FOY +35 111
>JD: AAEEIRT D7 A.IERATE +70 175
#note with my lucky tile draw I would've had tracheae instead, so not punished for making a mistake

#note holy cow, glossary for 95 fits!
>JD: EEEIPPU 8L PU.E +27 251
#note I saw pipeage but thought it would give back way too many points. quackle disagrees, I guess there already a lot of places to score, and the bag is a little consonant-heavy so it would help fill in the EU leave
>Doug_Brockmeier: BDIN 15A BIND +41 291
>JD: EEEIPVW E3 VIEWE. +26 277
#note auto-piloted viewer, missed PEEVE at the bottom for 8 more. important to scrounge points if I'm going to catch up! no need to bingo necessarily.
>Doug_Brockmeier: GHMNO 4B HOM.NG +24 315
#note doug spent a lot of time on this move. smart play to take away the lanes I opened and turn over a lot of tiles in search of the blank. on the other hand, he was starting to run low on time.
>JD: ?ENPTTX 9M P.X +31 308
#note ideally I wouldn't block the P at 7M, but POX increases my bingo chances from 37% to 57%
>Doug_Brockmeier: AJT 3A TAJ +43 358
#note doug actually spent a lot of time on this move, which is interesting since this seems like a dream play (scores a tonne, blocks up the board)
>JD: ?DENOTT F8 .NDOTTEd +64 372
#note lucky to have a bingo at all, but I missed RATTOONED even though it's a word I've studied!! my win percentage drops from 66% to 45% for missing that one
>Doug_Brockmeier: ABEM C10 BEMA +30 388
#note doug holds but doesn't challenge, and is now down to about 2 minutes
>JD: ALNORUW J11 ROWAN +29 401
#note I tried to really make quick moves at the end, saw WOE at 5C but I didn't like the potential of the LUNAR leave.
>Doug_Brockmeier: LOV M2 VOL. +14 402
>JD: CEIILUU 15J .UCLEI +33 434
#note lucky to have any plays at all with this rack, I had doug to 20 seconds and just had to play it and see what happens...
>Doug_Brockmeier: EFGILOR 2J FRI.OL +40 442
#note this looked like a pretty sick play under time pressure, but if he plays GEE on this turn at 5C, he forces me to make a game-winning block of FRIVOL and saves FROLIC in reserve - but if I find NAVAR/SAVIN/RAVIN/INVAR, I win by 1 point! instead...
>JD: AAINRSU 1F URANIAS +84 518
#note luckboxxxx. although I did get to this point by forcing doug into time trouble.
