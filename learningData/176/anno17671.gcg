#note None of my options are particularly good.  I considered F7 BORN but, despite the leave, thought it reckless to give up an E hook on the 2x2 for only 8 points given that I was only drawing 3 tiles.  9B/7B BRAND didn't appeal to me due to board position, and I wasn't sure about BARNED.  This is one of my two highest scoring options.  Best if the duck is to be believed is BORN, with this as a very close runner up.

>Jim_Burlant: CDDINRV L8 .CRID +16 30
#note I didn't like my choice a whole lot here, and the sim more or less confirms that, if you miss the one good play that was available, the rest of my options all suck.  The play I needed to find but never saw was C(OR)VID F7.  That said, CORVID barely wins 18%; this wins 13-1/2 and sims WAY down the list.
>Chris_Cree: EEEIL K3 EELIE. +25 123
>Jim_Burlant: ADGINTV 4H GIV.N +22 52
#note If I find CORVID on the previous turn, I have GRADIENT on row 3 for 76 and I'm back in the game.  Instead I have this dreck, which doesn't even make any 8's.  Nothing really scores well, and if you look at a sim, everything sims within 1-1/2% winning chances and 2 points of the best play.  In short, anything is pretty much as good as anything else here.  That said, AVID 11J is slightly better but like I said, the difference isn't huge, and the more dangerous board position with this play doesn't come back to haunt me.
>Chris_Cree: EIPY 10B YIPE +21 144
>Jim_Burlant: ABDFGTU 11C FAG +35 87
#note I finally got one play right.  This is best, but it's still bleak - 12% to win.
>Chris_Cree: EOZ 10J ZE.O +33 177
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDEOTU 12G OBTrU.ED +64 151
#note Or OBTUNDED in the same location; those are the only bingoes.  25% to win in a short sim.
>Chris_Cree: EJW 13E JEW +26 203
>Jim_Burlant: EEKMSUV 11K M.KE +40 191
#note Took a long time before I finally found this.  While it sucks to have to keep UV in my rack, 40 points is 40 points, and if he doesn't have an S or a D, I'm practically guaranteed to have 30+  coming back down the O column on my next turn.    Once I saw this, I stopped looking, and with good reason - this is definitely best.
>Chris_Cree: CIILST O6 LICITS +35 238
#note Given that I'm now sitting on EFPSUUV, how sure about this do I have to be to challenge it?  This is why I should learn definitions so I know whether something takes an S or not.  LICIT is an adjective and does not take an S.  I knew ELICIT did and, not wanting to risk losing the turn sitting on this garbage, thought LICIT might have been a verb so I let it go.  This cost me any chance  at this game.
>Jim_Burlant: EFPSUUV 14F FE +32 223
#note I agonized over this, and if I'd challenged off LICITS as I should have I'd have had a much easier time of this turn.  The play screaming to be made from this rack is FEU 14F...but with HHM unseen I just couldn't wrap my arms around giving up back so many easy points when the O column was no longer there for me.  So, I felt that I'd have to grind.  Q says I need to play my rack and concede the position and play FEU.  FEU should have been the play.

>Chris_Cree: MU H14 MU +20 299
>Jim_Burlant: ANNSTUV H1 VAN. +24 271
#note I saw Q's preferred play of VAUNTS 15A but felt that it didn't help me - Chris agreed with me post mortem that, points or not, I needed to open up.  24.5% to win.
>Chris_Cree: ?GINRTW 7B RINGTaW +72 371
#note And that just about does it.
>Jim_Burlant: DNOOSTU 15A DONUTS +30 301
#note Ostensibly, NODOUS keeping the T is slightly better - that wins 2.9% and this wins 1.5.  What miracle can I conjure up to win this game?
>Chris_Cree: AAH 14A AHA +27 398
>Jim_Burlant: AANOORR 9A OAR +16 317
#note Ostenisbly, ORA N4 scores 9 and potentially gives me an X bomb, but how likely will he be to let that go?  In the real world, this is best.

>Jim_Burlant: ANOORTX D3 TAXO. +24 341
>Chris_Cree: DE 12C ED +25 439
>Chris_Cree:  (NOR) +6 445
#note I probably had enough margin for error to weather one of the two  mistakes I made (missing CORVID and not challenging LICITS*), but not both. In particular, letting LICITS* stick was huge.   Too many mistakes on my end, period.
