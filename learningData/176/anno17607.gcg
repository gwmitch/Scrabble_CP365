#note The main thing is to bingo, double the W, and not give back any easy plays due to vowel placement.  Mission more or less accomplished.   That said,  I should place the blank in the F column instead of where I did; all things being otherwise equal, this gives back one more point if his play is down the F column, which is why Q says that TWInNED is 0.2 points better.  That said, that's splitting hairs.

>Jim_Burlant: ABHILNT 11B BI.HT +22 100
#note Looked in vain for an 8 (saw BIATHLON but couldn't find anything else - turns out there is nothing else).  I saw 3's at 7B like BIT and BAT for 23 but rejected them.  BIT gives up an O front hook down the A column and both BIT and BAT keep the H, which I really want to unload.  I also considered BATH/BAHT C12 but didn't think they scored well enough relative to BIGHT to justify slotting the 3x3 for only 3 more points.  The play I missed, BATH 7B, scores 32 and definitely looks best.  I just never recognized plays longer than 3 letters along row 7.  This is mediocre.

#note Okay, at least I bingoed...but lots of better choices were available that I whiffed on.  Not only does MELANOMA at 1H get lots more style points, but it also garners 18 more scoreboard points.  Still in good shape at 66% to win.
>Paul_Holser: EEINNSS 6F IN.ENSES +64 182
#note Or NICENESS in the same place.  Both score identically.
>Jim_Burlant: ABIOQRU 2B BAROQU. +76 244
#note Paul has been on the short end of an utterly brutal losing streak to me these last few months.  Practically every time we play, I hit easy opening rack bingoes, draw the lion's share of the good tiles, and if he is in the game his tiles inevitably fizzle and the games all break in my favor.  This play (clearly best, nothing else worth consideration) was one of two crucial moments in the game, as it blocked his impending bingo.  78% to win when simmed against his actual rack.

>Paul_Holser: EEEKORV --  -92 182
#note Call me crazy, but given my history against Paul, I thought this was a good gamble on his part - he just didn't sell it well enough.  What I mean:  my challenge grid against Paul is beyond red.  Very rarely do I win challenges against him, as Paul has very strong word knowledge.   While I'd never seen this played before, it was certainly plausible. It also looked low-prob enough that I would not yet have encountered it in study.   What pushed me over the edge to challenge?  His response to BAROQUE made it clear I'd blocked something and it took him a while to refocus before he put this down.   If it were good, I thought he'd have seen it immediately through the wide open S.  In other words, if he'd reacted with more of a poker face after BAROQUE and immediately put this down calmly I'd have held and probably let it go.  But, because he didn't sell it right, I challenged.  His best legitimate play is L4 REEVOKE, which he hits on his next turn.
>Jim_Burlant: EFINOTU 5B FINO +24 268
#note I considered three  plays here:  FOU 5L, FOUNT E1,  and this. FOU is nice for grooming the rack but it gives him an easy REVOKE down the O column, so that was a non-starter.  FOUNT E1 unloaded the U and outscored FOU, but it left me too vowel heavy so I rejected it. This was the only other play I saw, it outscored everything else I saw by quite a bit, so I put it down.  A sim indicates I was making this position much harder than it needed to be:  even though he didn't have a playable bingo, I should have looked to block his best play, which didn't occur to me.  The simple TOFU(S) M2 blocks REEVOKE and is the winner when simmed against his rack of EEEKORV.  Either that or the slick 7B FUTON were the plays here.  This evaluates as so-so in the sim and I agree:  while this outscores all the options except FUTON, it leaves me a hair vowel heavy while I'm still saddled with the U, and the 24 points this scores aren't so great that I should play for 24 and not defend with TOFUS.  The only purely offensive option that's worthwhile here is FUTON, which I never saw.  
>Paul_Holser: EEEKORV L4 RE.VOKE +30 212
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFTUX K10 FAUX +33 301
#note I only considered this and the M10 placement of this word.  I chose this because I thought it might have made it marginally harder for him to use the X.  Q slightly disagrees, saying M10 was better but the difference in the sim is splitting hairs.  The other choice that wins the bronze medal in the sim is one I never considered:  FATE 1A is also very strong, and had I found that, this game would not have become as interesting as it was about to.
>Paul_Holser: ADEZ 1A DAZE +63 275
#note Ouch!  As he put this down, I was wondering to myself:  how is he even in this game?!?  
>Jim_Burlant: AAEETTT M10 TATE +14 315
#note Blind to row 7 yet again.  However, this time there was a good reason for me to be:  while Quackle indicates I was right to float the X on my previous turn, I wanted to take away easy plays like HIN L12.    This play (or TEAT in the same location) accomplishes that while it does the best job possible of balancing the rack. While this is way down the kibbitzer's list of static choices,  a sim indicates that 7A TEAT is best, and that this is a very strong choice in its own right because of its defensive strength.  Given this position I'm fine with this play.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEGILT N10 AGILE +32 347
#note Now the tables are turned - he's just blocked my impending EGALITE N8.  Anyway, this is best.

>Jim_Burlant: EEHJOTW O5 HOW. +10 357
#note Now it's decision time, and this position was anything but a no-brainer for me, as it's not like he had transposed tiles when he put down a SATIRE 7.   Because PSORALEA is not an easy find, and given that PARASOLE* would have scored 92 if it were good, I considered the possibilities.  Did he mistakenly think the 61-point PSORALEA had a 92-point anagram?  Or had he just entirely missed PSORALEA, never to find it?  I initially considered JEHU 12H to give myself a comeback play, assuming that he was going to bingo.  But the what-if's crossed my mind:  what if he whiffs on the bingo and plays JARL for 33?  What if I don't draw into an H12 extension?  Ultimately, I opted for the sure thing:  blocking his bingo and setting  up JETE on the next turn. As for quackle, a 3-ply sim run against his rack shows that my choice and TOWHEE O3 (neither of which are in the original kibbitzer choices) are among the best plays I have.   Its top choice, however, does exactly what I had originally wanted to do with the JEHU play I rejected:  OBJET B10 (which I never saw) scores 32 and pushes my lead to 74 (PSORALEA only scores 61)  and guarantees me 32 or 34 points with HEW on the next turn.  That said, OBJET does have one weakness:  assuming a sequence of OBJET/missed bingo/HEW, he could still hit something like MANDRILS on row 1 (a possibility given the remaining bag is DILNOPRRSTUUY), where my choice puts the onus on him to open up.  I'm fine with this.
>Paul_Holser: AALOPRS 10D .OAL +16 321
#note  I had flashed the J before putting down HOWE on my previous turn.  If I had not done that, he may have attempted to open with BOLA B11.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEJLTT N2 JETE +27 384
#note  7B JET preserves one of my E's but this defends and JET doesn't. This is definitely best.

>Jim_Burlant: DRS 14M R.D +9 417
#note Wasn't sure if BAROQUES took the S.  I was also low on time and I wound up going over by 50 seconds.  Everything wins, but DAZED and BAROQUES are my two best plays; they win by 8 more points than this.
>Paul_Holser: PRSU H10 SPUR +13 379
>Paul_Holser:  (S) +2 381
#note Time penalty.  Final score 407 - 381.  Not perfectly played on my end by any stretch.  BIGHT cost me more than just the 10 scoreboard points I missed on that turn:  if I play BIGHT, I have AILMNO? on the next turn and slap down MONORAIL 2x2 for 86, which blocks INCENSES. And there's no good reason for me to play FINO instead of TOFUS.  Besides the suboptimal bingo, I made two intermediate mistakes where one is within my own personal standard of acceptability.  Fortunately my opponent made bigger mistakes.  I'll give myself a B- for this one, aided by fortuitous drawing.
