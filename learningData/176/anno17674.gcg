#note A little surprised by the sim result.  If Q is to be believed it's almost worth it to play for 22 and keep BERS.  I saw 42 points and looked no further.  This is best, but Quackle indicates it's not the slam-dunk you'd think it should be.

>Jim_Burlant: BFHISTY H13 FIB +32 74
#note At the time, I felt that it was too early to consider the S disposable, even if there wasn't an S hook anywhere.  That's why I passed up FISHY 12H in favor of this.  Quackle says this is best but in retrospect I'm not so sure I like this play.  While he's sitting on 7 random tiles, the lack of an S hook on this board combined with the counter overload makes me think that I needed to clear more of the rack and not leave myself without vowels.  FISHY or SHIFTY on row 12 might have been better.  YMMV.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?AILNUX E5 UNi.XIAL +106 180
#note Or LUXATING or LUXATION at 11E.  Regardless, this is a beautiful play, but in a word...OUCH!!!!   Sam's 87% to win with this. And my next rack doesn't help matters any, either.
>Jim_Burlant: BHRSTYZ G7 H.RBY +18 92
#note Sad but true - I was so brainlocked by the counter overload I just never saw what should have been the obvious 10D BIZ.  That said, this clears more of the counter overload and I wind up benefitting from this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CO 9C CO. +24 204
>Jim_Burlant: EEIKSTZ D11 ZEK +47 139
#note I'm sure glad I turned 4 tiles last turn - finally, the rack is starting to come together.  This is clearly best - noething else is worth consideration, and I'm back up to almost 21% winning chances.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: N 11D ..N. +16 220
>Jim_Burlant: ADEISTU 11I .AU +6 145
#note Right idea, wrong execution:  with no playable bingoes, fish to open up the eastern half of the board.  FEU 13H might have been a hair safer because it doesn't give back the T hooks, but this worked out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AL G14 LA +10 230
>Jim_Burlant: DEILSTU L6 DUELIST +72 217
#note Board blindness setting in:  H1 STUDLIER is clearly best here; I had fixated on taking out the easy hook I had just opened up.  Nothing like throwing  away 16 scoreboard points and 9% winning chances because I didn't take time to look at the board. 33% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AAILMNO D3 LAMA +18 248
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEMOPR 3A iMP.ORED +76 293
#note Two can play the I'll follow-up-a-bingo-by-drawing-another-bingo game.  Despite my mistakes, I'm now 70% to win with this, the only bingo.   Q indicates that passing up the bingo with J13 MOP is also a very strong choice.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GIINORT 2G RIOTING +65 313
#note 2H IGNITOR scores 73 but he was worried about how easy it would be for me to hit plays on row 1 to take out 1H if he didn't add more resistance.  Q disagrees with him.  IGNITOR wins 51%; this wins 43.
>Jim_Burlant: ANNPSVV 1F VAV +51 344
#note The leave sucks, but 51 points is 51 points.  This is clearly best, and I'm 66% to win.  Besides, I'm only drawing 3 tiles and there's only 1 N unseen.  How likely am I to draw a third one?
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CFOY B1 CO.FY +30 343
>Jim_Burlant: ENNNPST 14A PENS +29 373
#note Ugh.  My last play has me keeping duplicated N's, there's only 1 N left in the bag...so I wind up with the case N?  I brain locked here, as the play I couldn't think of was 8k PENNE.  If you miss that, apparently you should just fish with INN 10L.  I saw the pool and figured that, as long as he didn't have EIW in his rack, I'd be okay.  PENNE wins 75%' this wins 59. Yuck.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIW A12 WI.E +39 382
#note Of course.
>Jim_Burlant: EEIINNT M2 .IEN +10 383
#note I'd at least been hoping for an A or O to be able to play down the A column, but no luck.  Then again, if I'd played PENNE like I should have, I'd be playing SIENITE 4H instead of having to dink off for chump change.  Q likes slightly longer plays - I figured this would give me a decent shot at a bingo - I don't need a big one; even a 60-pointer will do.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AHOT A5 OATH +26 408
>Jim_Burlant: DEINSTW 4L W.D +14 397
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  The idea was to open an S hook...except I forgot to account for all A and O front hooks that would neutralize this.  WE 4L is apparently best.  Some of me wondered if 4L WEND was good, but Q thinks that's a disaster.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEOOQTU 4K O... +8 416
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: EGINRST 10L .T +2 399
#note This doesn't show up among the original choices, but EGINRS makes a 7 with everything in the pool except the Q, so the idea was to open up the S hook and see if he could figure out how to defend.  By all rights I've played very inconsistently in this one and frankly, don't deserve the win at all.  But, watch what happens:
