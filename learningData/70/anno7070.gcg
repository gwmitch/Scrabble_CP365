#note There is no reason this shouldn't be a word if OUTGNAW is a word.  Then again, OUTGNAW really shouldn't be a word either.  There is a picture somewhere of this word being judged.
>Ben: JOY 8G JOY +26 26
>Joey: CEHOTUW 9F HOWE +33 33
#note Probably a mistake.  OW saves a much better leave, and doesn't lead to an ugly staircase formation of words.
>Ben: EEFL 10E FEEL +32 58
>Joey: AACKNTU 11D KAT +30 63
#note KUNA is better.  The U was like that fly in the room that wouldn't go away.

>Joey: ACEFIRX A13 .AX +39 147
#note I think APEX H1 is better.  Playing the E makes this a much awkwarder leave, though.

>Joey: CEFIPRU 4H CUPI. +13 160
#note I didn't like any options at all here.  Obviously, I don't want to shut down this part of board, but the plays that scored more saved unwieldy combos.
