#note FOH D4 is the equity play and is probably a touch better.  But the way this rips open the board is highly desirable.

#note It was probably a sign of my fatigue that it took me a long time to find this play.  I kept seeing things like YURTA, YUCAS 15K, and BUOY, but my intuition told me there ought to be something better.  If I had been alerter, I might have found an even better play: SAUCY C3.

#note The star play this time, but another one that cost me dearly on the clock.
>Grant: ?DEEEST A3 .EEDiEST +86 409
#note There's a good case to make here for bingoing on row 13 instead, as it is much more likely to be a productive line for me than the A column.  As it turned out, I would have played WETWARE.
>Dave: AEELRTW 13C WELTER +36 436
#note This seems like the right idea.  It's too late in the game to fish, and the endgame timing is good.
>Grant: KL 8L ..LK +33 442
#note He blocked my bingo, but this shouldn't be too hard to win with a reasonable out in two.  But in my tired state and short of time, I muffed it up.  At first all the scoring plays I could find left tiles that were too awkward to go out.  Then, down to less than a minute I immediately jumped at a reasonable scoring play that guaranteed an out...
>Dave: ADEIMNU N6 DU.IA +21 457
#note ... but I realized as soon as I made it that I was giving him a very big comeback.
>Grant: ?ABGGOO O10 GABOOn +36 478
#note If he knows and can find the word GOBANG, he can even win.
>Dave: EMN B5 MEN +17 474
#note What became obvious to me shortly after the game was that I should have just played the last two moves in the reverse order.  I have a second out with AUDIO, so that guarantees a win.  In fact, it's Quackle's top choice.
>Dave:  (G) +4 478
#note I blew it, but at least it wasn't in a tournament game.  It was fun too, and Grant fought hard.
