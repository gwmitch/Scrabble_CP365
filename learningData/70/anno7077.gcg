>John_Merlau: BDEGIU 8D GUIDE +18 18
#note He showed a B, so I guess he didn't know BUDGIE.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEHLNOY E8 .NHOLY +24 24
#note I knew I was missing something here.  Just really misplayed this.  HOY, HOYDEN, HOYLE, YODH.  Take your pick.
>John_Merlau: ABIRSU 7F AIRBUS +20 38
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEEITW 13B DEW. +22 46
#note 12A WIDD(L)E 30?  I don't know, mine seems okay.
>John_Merlau: AAE 12D A.AE +18 56
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIIMT 8K IMIDE +35 81
#note K5 MI(S)EDIT or MI(S)DATE -- I'm pretty bad at finding 7-letter non-bingo 2x2s.
>John_Merlau: CDEIRST 13G DIRECTS +81 137
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AINRTV M3 VITRA.Ns +74 155
#note Took a long tim here; good to see this is best.  Of note: M5 ANT(I)VIRu(S) 66!
>John_Merlau: NORT 14A TORN +22 159
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BEELOZ 11G BEZEL +38 193
#note On the downside, I blocked OBELiZE(D) for 128.  Aw.  Maybe AVeRTIN(G) had its merits.  Maybe I should've played OBEL(I)ZE anyway.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEELNVW D4 AVEN.E +22 348
#note I'm not gonna say I saw 14H NEW.  That's pretty nifty.  But, my play closes two of the remaining lanes, and for that, I like it!
>John_Merlau: MO 15A OM +24 274
>Ryan_Fischer: ALPQRTW 3H QAT +18 366
#note Didn't want to open anything up here.  There's a principle to be had here.  SUQ is still possible, yes.  But what happens when it's gone?  Can't use the Q or the TO, so you're able to make a 2-to-3, then a 3-to-4, if you have that exclusive hook.  I honestly forgot about SUQ at the time, and perhaps Q(I) is the best solution.  This one is interesting, but could come back to bite me as well.
>John_Merlau: IKO C9 KOI +24 298
>Ryan_Fischer: ILOPRSW I2 W.. +6 372
#note I thought I was being pretty creative here, but it only sims okay.  I guess because there aren't any bingos to be had there with that pool (except for SPOILER, which wouldn't fit).
>John_Merlau: CERU 5A CUR.E +20 318
>Ryan_Fischer: ILOPPRS A5 .LOP +24 396
#note Even with my setup, Q poohpoohs on CLOP -> RIPS, wanting S(C)RIP -> O(A)F -> PO(T), etc.
