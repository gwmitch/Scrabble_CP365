>Winter: EIJLMNR 8D MERLIN +22 22
#note Drawing the blanks has really helped me against Marlon, so that's what I'm going for. Plus, I totally expect him to have a D or N if I give him JIN.
>Marlon_Hill: ABDEELV I6 VE.DABLE +68 68
>Winter: ?EFGGJR 10H J.GG +17 39
#note No idea what to do here, so I decided to give myself best shot at bingo.

#note Oh, I can believe I missed that.
>Marlon_Hill: ANOTT A1 O.TANT +27 225
#note I thought I was going to lose it to the trip-trip here!!!

>Winter: CIILNSU O4 CIS +22 319
#note Oh shit, if I draw like this for the rest of the game I'm FUCKED!!! I start to play URIC, but I figure Marlon HAS to have an S to hit that hook. Missed INCUS though.
>Marlon_Hill: EEHORT 2J HETERO +56 336
#note OH SHIT!!!
>Winter: IILNTUU 11M .IN +16 335
#note Not the best play, but it actually worked out because Marlon thought I was fishing.
>Marlon_Hill: NOW 9C WON +29 365
>Marlon_Hill: NOW --  -29 336
#note OH DAMN!!! My heart stopped, and I figured the game was lost. Marlon hadn't played any phonies on me up to that point, but I thought waaaay back to GINKOES*, plus there is no way I win if that stays.
>Winter: ILSTTUU 3C TI.TS +34 369
#note Yeah, I hated the ULU leave, but given that Marlon didn't seem to have an awesome play, I thought the 34 points might carry me thru. Plus I block that D4 spot, since he had the O.
>Marlon_Hill: WY 13G W..Y +26 362
>Winter: ELSTUUY K10 .UYS +30 399
#note OMG I MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN!!!

Too low on time to think too hard--just decided that this was enough.
>Marlon_Hill: DGNOOPV 9C GOD +27 389
#note Should have anticipated this though.
>Winter: ELTU D8 ..ULT +14 413
#note DAMN!!! I LOVE HAVING MY (G)LUTES MASSAGED, BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOOD IN SCRABBLE!!!

#note OMG OMG OMG!!! GET READY FOR AMATEUR SCRABBLE PORN!!!
