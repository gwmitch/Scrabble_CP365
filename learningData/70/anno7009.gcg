#note I thought this play looked good, playing off a bunch for the second blank, but the sim prefers FOWL 12H which has a much better leave. Interesting, but I don't mind my choice.

#note I showed this rack to Pakorn after the game and he preferred HONAn to use up one more tile and for the points. My play sims better--my plan was that I was keeping the A for row 15 and the H for 6J. Using more tiles to go for the blank could have been critical, though.

#note Not a great play--I absolutely needed to play more tiles and more Ns. HAEN C7 and HENNA C6 seem like better options, and as it turned out the blank was still in the bag. I really could have won this game.

#note I was hoping for the blank for ENNEAd, but that would have lost anyway.
