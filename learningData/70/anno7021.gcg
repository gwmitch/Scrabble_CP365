#note I found most of my bingos in this tournament, but I missed PHRATRY hear.  Not the worst one to miss.
>Peter: DGIINOZ M9 DOZING +47 227
#note Peter told me I blocked IODIZING.  That must be why I decided to pass up PHRATRY.

#note This isn't as safe as it appears, now that there are existing 8-letter words ending in V, including the still available TOLARJEV.  I was really tempted to take the style points with QUAINT I3, but figured this would still be good enough.
>Peter: DEIL 4F DELI +17 300
>Joey: AEEINNO 3B EONIAN +20 396
#note This should win every time, but I could win by a few more points by blocking the bottom row with something like AEON 14A.
>Peter: ?INOORW 15A IRONWOo. +86 386
#note Peter certainly made a valiant attempt at a comeback.
