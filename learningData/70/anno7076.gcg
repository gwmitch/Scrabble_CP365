>Ryan_Fischer: AFGIILL 8D FILIAL +26 26
>Dave_Leifer: ELX 7E LEX +39 39
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DGOOUW 9H WOOD +17 43
#note As soon as I hit the clock, I saw that WOG was better.  GUMWOOD(S) is the only 7 or 8 here.
>Dave_Leifer: DV F6 V..D +16 55
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGIOTU K3 OuTGUI.E +68 111
#note Best and only.
>Dave_Leifer: HNT 10I TH.N +31 86
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGNQSU 10B QUAGS +48 159
#note I contemplated SUQ, but I saw QUAGS scored 2 more, moved 3 more tiles, and got rid of the G.  Maybe I should've taken the spot, but I like volatility versus Dave.
>Dave_Leifer: FMR 3J F.RM +18 104
#note Wow, he must be getting NO vowels.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIINPT 7I PI. +17 176
#note Ooh, just dumping the I for I(LEX) is cute.  Of note: N1 TIEPIN 30.  I *thought* FORME was good; couldn't remember for sure!
>Dave_Leifer: ELR D8 .L.RE +16 120
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINRT 13C ARENITE +77 253
#note The hook is bogus; plays at N1 and N2 score 1 more.
>Dave_Leifer: NORY 8K .RONY +27 147
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEIOSZ 11K SEIZE +50 303
>Dave_Leifer: ?ACDEKS 14I SlACKED +78 225
#note I thought DACKErS seemed familiar to me.
>Ryan_Fischer: AACEOST O13 O.A +12 315
#note Decided to go for spread with the case S in tow.  Q sort of agrees, but wants O(K)A instead.  *shrug*

>Dave_Leifer:  (A) +2 348
#note I misadded by 20 points somewhere, only gave myself credit for 518.  His score was recorded as 347.  I lost one game to Ian later by 10.  I sure hope I didn't make any mistakes like that there.  Ugh!
