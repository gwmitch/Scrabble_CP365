#note His opening play saved me from having to trade with this dreadful rack.  But I wasn't totally happy about having to do this when I couldn't remember if WILLOWER was good.

#note Quackle does not approve.  I had several better plays.  The best by far is APPROVE 3G.
>Johnny_O: DEFSU 14B FUSED +40 112
>Dave: ADEQUVV 2F QU.D +34 122
#note It's a funny choice here between keeping two V's or the the QU, but I think this is reasonable.
>Johnny_O: DEFT 15E DEFT +30 142
>Dave: AEEIRVV 11D .EVIVE +24 146
#note I totally missed WILLOWIER for 40 points.  With both blanks unseen, turnover is at a premium, so this made more sense than something like VIBE or VARVE.
>Johnny_O: CIRSTT J2 STRICT +33 175
#note Sets up the ASTRICT hook, which I eyed for the rest of the game but wasn't able to do anything good with.

>Dave: GGIMNNR 5I M.RING +18 206
#note I clearly wasn't looking closely enough for parallel plays in this game.  GOWNING is the star play.  At the same time, I realized it was crucial to continue playing for turnover.  I first laid down MINING, but changed my mind for two reasons: MININGS and keeping NG seemed wise with so many I's to draw.
>Johnny_O: AEILNTU K7 ALUNITE +66 282
#note John said afterward that if I had played MINING setting up the S hook, he would have played this at 14H setting up another one.

>Dave: ABEIJOR N7 RIOJA +33 325
#note It was getting more and more stressful not seeing any blanks, but I think this is the right idea.  I need to score a lot and grab as many of the remaining tiles as I can.  Blocking bingo lanes and setting up possible Z spots is not bad either.  If he bingos on column B, I might be able to come back with a Z play, or vice versa.
>Johnny_O: AE 15A AE +11 323
#note John didn't have the blank yet and was dealing with a surfeit of vowels.  However, he recognized that the bag he was dipping into was so rich that he could afford to empty it.  Now I am lost because he has MEANDERS 1H in addition to bingos on the B column.  Against a lesser player I would have blocked the B-line, but I trusted John would find the spot.
>Dave: ?BEEETZ L2 BEZ.l +30 355
#note BEZANT is a few points better.
