#note Nothing seemed very great here, but BOOGY E7 wins the sim - I guess the MITI leave might not be so bad.

#note Another tough call. I think this was okay, keeping the board as open as possible, though I would have preferred a better leave.

#note I was loath to release the E with something like HIDED 14F. I guess this play gave off the impression that I had the blank (I only wished!), sending Brian into lockdown mode.

#note There were a few possibilities to go for: JOINTURE was a big one, or maybe OPERATING. I thought ET at G2 would be much too easy to kill.

#note Wisely taking out the J threat, and my best X spot in the process.
