#note Leave and defense aren't great, but 34 points is a lot to pass up. Don't think there's anything better here.

#note Not sure what the best option is here, but Quackle suggests a really fascinating one: INIA 9A. Down 52, needing a bingo to get back in it, holding a blank -- why not open another triple-triple? It's a really crazy volatility play, but it's just crazy enough to work.

#note JEST 10B is the other option for better defense. But I really liked this leave a lot more -- as four-consonant leaves go, GNRT has good synergy.

#note TANAGER looks better here, especially to keep the vowel away from the DLS. LEAF or somesuch would really hurt. Not sure what I was thinking.

#note Had to score and had to dump as many of these consonants as possible. Sorry, S, you've got to go.
>Cecilia: EELNSTW 1A WEEN +31 429
>Evans: IKNPQRZ 10B QI. +32 463
#note I don't have a choice but to dump the Q, even though she could easily bingo out. This gives me a 3/8 shot -- she has a bingo for the win unless the last tile in the bag is the N, S or T.
>Cecilia: AAEILST N8 .ETIALS +24 453
#note It's the N. Lucky me.
