>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ACKM H7 MACK +24 24
>Winter: DEEJOWW 10F JO.ED +37 37
#note Eww, with the two WWs, but I think JO(K)ED is the play. I'm hoping that by running up a lead on Brad, after beating him 7 times in a row, I can psyche him out, burn time off his clock.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: DILO 11C LIDO +19 43
>Winter: EFOOTWW 12D TOW +32 69
#note Damn stupid miss.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEILRSV 6D REVISAL +83 126
>Winter: EEFOTUW 5C FEW +30 99
#note Still okay. After 7 losses, I expect Brad to draw a little sumthin sumthin.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: DENORTY 8H .ROYNTED +89 215
#note Okay, I'll admit he was due. But I can still survive this.
>Winter: EEEHOTU 4D HOE +30 129
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: APX 5I PAX +30 245
#note Hmm... I DO need him to fizzle at some point.
>Winter: BEEENTU 4J BEE +24 153
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?AEGIMN O1 iMAGINE. +89 334
#note Okay, now it's getting ridiculous.
>Winter: ?AENOTU 13F sOUTANE +71 224
#note Purposefully play at this spot hoping that I'll be able to get 33+ off H12--I mean, his racks have to fizzle, right?
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AINY 12I AYIN +27 361
#note NOOOO!!!
>Winter: DFLOQUU 11K FOUL +29 253
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ANRV 3K VARN. +31 392
#note Damn boy, slow down!!!		
>Winter: DHOQSSU 14J HO +37 290
#note OMG, so close to getting back in the game. Just one tile, that's what I need!!! Considered HOS, but afraid that will tell Brad I have another S, and he might block.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: IRT N5 TIR. +14 406
>Winter: CDPQSSU L10 C...D +15 305
#note BAG FULL OF As and Is AND I CAN'T DRAW ONE???? I get so frazzled I play the D. Not that it mattered given what I would draw.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: BEIT N10 B.ITE +26 432
#note There goes any chance of catching up.
>Winter: GPQSSUU H13 .P +4 309
#note CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS DRAW??? Well, I have exactly one chace, if I can get QUAGS or SQUEGS.5
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AIL D10 L..AI +5 437
>Winter: GGQSSUU 15E SUQS +54 363
#note Not that it would have mattered, since Brad blocked, but CAN YOU BELIEVE HOW BAD I'M DRAWING!!!
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEEIRRT O12 TIRE +22 459
