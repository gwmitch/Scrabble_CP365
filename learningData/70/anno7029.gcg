>Bing: AABFNUZ 8G FUB +16 16
>Rafi: DIJOQRV G8 .JORD +24 24
#note Seems worth taking the points instead of QUOD or an exchange, but it's a close call.
>Bing: AAEEINZ 12B ZENAI.A +36 52
#note Either this or ZOEAE.

>Bing: ACEEOTU B2 COATEE +28 112
>Rafi: ?AEGINN 4B .NEArING +68 152
#note Pretty defensive, and sims best. (INNAGEs for 71 is a couple points back.)
>Bing: ACLOPUW A13 WOP +31 143
>Rafi: AEFGKSW 15E SKEW +48 200
#note Or add the A - not a huge difference.
>Bing: ACHLNUX 3G XU +36 179
>Rafi: ADFGGNV C9 GAG.D +40 240
#note (Missed FAGGED in the same spot.)

>Rafi: FILNUVY E3 V.INLY +24 264
>Bing: DEINORU 13H DOURINE +71 283
#note Not sure why I didn't take the safer NEUROID for 1 point less. Luckily, it didn't cost this time.
>Rafi: ABFITTU 12L TUFT +27 291
>Bing: EHIMOTT O7 TOMTI. +24 307
#note A few plays were interesting, including HET 14J, but I liked this a little better.
>Rafi: ABIOSST D8 BOS +25 316
>Bing: EHILOOR 14N HO +28 335
#note Not feeling real great about my prospects here. Rafi was almost sure to have a bingo, so I probably needed to hit one of my own to have a chance. This play was probably very wrong. But watch what happened:
>Rafi: AEILRST N1 SALTIRE +70 386
#note This looked much more defensive than LITERALS, but...
>Bing: ?EIILOR 1F pI.LORIE. +59 394
#note Whew! LITERALS would have given me bupkus. I still think Rafi made the right play.
>Bing:  (EMNSY) +20 414
