>Howard_Pistol: TUX 8G TUX +20 20
>Ryan_Fischer: ADHINRT 9H HIND +24 24
#note HID leaves the E hook.  I like this better, Q (although it does open plays at 8K).
>Howard_Pistol: LOW 8K OWL +13 33
#note I really find it hard to understand what an opponent is thinking when s/he makes a play like this.  It allows me to breathe a little easier, though, at least unless they hit their pseudo-fish.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFIRRT M7 F.IRT +13 37
#note I missed the 10J spot for ADRIFT, which would've been much better.  Oops.
>Howard_Pistol: OSUYZ 12K SOYUZ +66 99
>Ryan_Fischer: ADLLLNR K5 ALL.. +12 49
#note Best, though that's not saying much.  *gulp*
>Howard_Pistol: EMY O12 .YME +54 153
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEILNR 11E REDLINE +86 135
#note Wow, did I ever get bailed out!
>Howard_Pistol: ABCIO L1 COBIA +26 179
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACEEOR N1 OChREAE +75 210
#note Best, thankfully.  COEn(ZYME) is third behind the two placements of this word.
>Howard_Pistol: AGIO H11 .OGIA +21 200
>Ryan_Fischer: EHNQRSW O6 WHEN +44 254
#note Close.  O5 HEWN 46.  Mental note: check for anagrams, dammit.
>Howard_Pistol: EGI 12C GIE +10 210
>Ryan_Fischer: AJPQRSV 1L .R.P +24 278
#note Well, this is 5th behind a whole mess of exchangesI don't hink it's that dire yet, or that bad an idea to score and hope to draw an A for JAVA or get rid of the Q.
>Howard_Pistol: ?AEEIRT 15C AcIER.TE +57 267
#note hERITA(G)E and InTERA(G)E is what he was looking for to score decently.  He told me he didn't want to open the 3x3, which is why he played what he did.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAJQSV 10B JAVA +33 311
#note Reminds me of the "Go Fish" game where you get to play again and you should "got what I wanted!" when you do.
>Howard_Pistol: BNU 14J BUN +21 288
>Ryan_Fischer: ADIQSSU 7D SQUAD +26 337
#note QUASI is best, although it gives back possible plays like GRIM.  If it's SQUAD, it should really be SQUID, I think.  Oops.
>Howard_Pistol: INOV 8A VINO +27 315
>Ryan_Fischer: EFINSTT F10 S.NT +28 365
#note This play sims best by far, which is understandable 'cause there aren't that many places left to score after it.  And I've still got the F.  Mwah.
>Howard_Pistol: P G6 P.. +5 320
#note Nice effort.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFIKMT D5 MI.. +6 371
#note Yet another place where Q is useless in pre-endgames.  At this score, it's not enough to not empty the bag.  You must block, considering GOATEES and GAROTES/ORGEATS (and maybe others) are extremely possible, and extremely game-losing.  MI(SO) is the best block.  TIK(I) will also work.  None of the things champ comes up with works.
