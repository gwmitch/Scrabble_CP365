#note Well, I can't win. Even if I challenge and play ZAX for 56, he plays (Q)UERN and keeps the blank. I might draw into a bingo, but there will be no place to play it. If I could have played ZAX or ZAXES, I would have let it go, but since I was going to each the Z or Q anyway, I figured I might as well challenge and try to cut the spread.
