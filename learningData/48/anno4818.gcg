#note Didn't know what to do here.  The high scoring play of JOIN is not very appealing.  Not only is the leave bad, but it also gives him lots of scoring opportunities.  I hoped that by setting up the O, I might be able to cash in the J in a big way.
>Seth: ENOTY H11 TONEY +32 54
>Dave: AAEJNRZ 10E AZ. +32 47
#note This is a little bit down Quackle's list, but I like it better than the alternatives, even though it didn't work out great for me in the game.  It seems that I can milk the most out of the J and Z by using them on separate turns here, whereas after JEEZ I'm likely not to have much on the next play.
>Seth: ABDE 11E BA..ED +37 91
>Dave: AEJNRTT 9C TAJ +23 70
#note Clearly best, despite creating the big opening.  I'm giving myself a good shot to bingo while keeping the board as dynamic as possible.
>Seth: AEGHINP 7H HEAPING +70 161
>Dave: EEINRRT 10I RENTIER +68 138
#note It was frustrating that I had no better bingos here.  I did see the disco nine, but it's just not that good a play.  With the 8A-D lane already opened, it made sense not to play scared.  I played this instead of REINTER directly because of the extra volatility on column M, which remains an important factor up until the end of the game.
>Seth: AFRY 8A FRAY +53 214
>Dave: DEMORRU O8 MU.DER +30 168
#note With the R leave and six more E's to go, this play seemed to give me good chances to make a fight of it.  I'll let the cat out of the bag a little here by telling you that I did not draw another E for the rest of the game.
>Seth: ABRW 7C BRAW +26 240
>Dave: DIOORTV L4 OVO.D +22 190
#note VIROID scores six more, and it would probably be a better play in an even game.  But at this score what this play does to the board is very desirable.  Plus, I'm still holding the R for the extension.
>Seth: GHNT 14F TH.GN +13 253
>Dave: DIKNPRT J6 P.RK.. +19 209
#note These are the kind of racks I was wading through for most of the tournament.  Still, not so bad.  Creating another bingo lane could be helpful, if I can ever manage to draw an S.
>Seth: AEELTU 15J ELUATE +23 276
#note That's where the E's are.
>Dave: DIMNOTX M2 MIX +33 242
>Seth: EELLSV 5E LEVELS +32 308
>Dave: ?ADNOST A8 .ONDAnTS +86 328
#note I didn't see STANDOFF, which is an interesting alternative.
>Seth: AELO B11 OLEA +18 326
>Dave: ?GIIOUW N1 WInO +31 359
#note Ugh, a really tough situation.  WOG C13 is the high scoring play keeping the blank, but holding ?IIU and drawing into that pool looks like an absolute disaster.  Championship player, which I don't trust here, seems to think it's my best shot, and gives it a little bit over a 50% chance to win.  It's amazing that even with a slight lead and the move I'm in such bad shape here, but he's got much better letters than I do for this board.
>Seth: CEFIOSS O1 OS +26 352
>Dave: CGIIU L10 .UG +8 367
#note I saw that CILIA E3 followed by GUV or GLUE would lead to a narrow loss after FICES, so I tried to block his play and hoped that he wouldn't notice my out.  But I missed another big play.
>Seth: CEFIS 14M FIE +32 384
#note Very nice play by Seth.  CILIA is a two point loss, so I had to challenge.
