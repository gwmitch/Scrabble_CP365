#note A good find, but what three better bingos did he miss? Brownie points if you can find all three of them. Don't beat yourself up if you can't.

#note I had a lot of time left, and I figured out that I would always have at least one out-play after this, and in those rare cases where I draw the Y, I'll have YIN L4 if he blocks YINS 12I. TROD also keeps the possibility of ZIN F8 open in case Jeff can't go out in two.

#note I determined that playing out in two is right, but I went about it all wrong. The right sequence is TIN L4, SKAGS H1. If I'm going to play at F8, ZIT is quite superior because it doesn't give back FEU 11E.
