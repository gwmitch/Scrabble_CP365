#note No bingos.  Matt Graham once played UNFAIRED# in a consultation game against Mark DiBattista and me.  It did not stay on the board.

#note The best play here is a Japanese six that takes no hooks.  I knew the word and could even give you the definition, but it doesn't mean a whole lot when you can't find it in the game, buster.

#note I was so happy to hit my draw that I played this quickly and didn't consider 15M OWN, which might be smarter.  I like it better than OWL with all those N's remaining.
