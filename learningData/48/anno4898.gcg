>Pete_Zeigler: DDQRSUW -DRW +0 0
#note PZ:  Not the usual play out of here to be sure, but I felt like taking a chance with the Q here, and as iy turns out, my logic wasn't that unsound.  Problem was more keeping the D rather than the R with QSU.  I couldn't bring myself to open SUQ, which is best.  
>Jason: DEIINPT 8G PI +8 8
#note Classic "play short or long?" opening rack. Duck approves.
>Pete_Zeigler: DHOQSUW 7H QUOD +26 26
#note PZ:Why the placement?  Because I was fixated on the I being available to hook on.  Bad me.
>Jason: DEHINOT 6J HONED +37 45
#note Gah! Saw HOIDEN at 6J, not 8J. Bad miss. (-11)
>Pete_Zeigler: HIISSWY 9F WISH +32 58
#note PZ: I considered SWISH, couldn't bring myself to burn both esses. I miss WHINS, which sims about even with SWISH. 
>Jason: ?AEITTU E9 sITUATE +72 117
#note Beats the planned 9H placement after his expected row 5 play, but only marginally.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEIORSY 5H DORY +36 94
#note PZ: I can't not step on my own feet.  After a day of good decisionmaking, I'm screwing up every one this game. Duck fishes with OY 5J.  I debated between REDYE 15A and DORY.  REDYE is better, but any number of fishes are best
>Jason: AEGIOOR 15A GOOI.R +24 141
>Pete_Zeigler: EIMPSSW 8K SWIPE +50 144
#note PZ: OMG I got one right,
>Jason: AEENRVY L8 .AVEY +28 169
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEMOST K11 MAE +23 167
#note PZ: Best static valuation.  14B SMOTE is style pointy, and H1 TAMED and MATED are right around MAE and MOA at the top. 
>Jason: AEEILNR 11B ELA.ERIN +58 227
#note Wrong bingo, ninny. Don't know why AEEILNPR didn't ring any bells. (-12)
>Pete_Zeigler: AELOSTT N8 .ALETOTS +74 241
#note JI: Rightly whacked for the mistake both ways. My draw and his play.
>Jason: BCCEFLR 13C FL.B +18 245
#note Or CR(A)B. (-1)
>Pete_Zeigler: FIIMORS O14 OI +14 255
#note PZ: Paranoia is such an unattractive quality. H1  FIORD is just fine here. OI is only 15% worse in winning percentage, so it's not a big thing.
>Jason: CCEENRX B9 EX.C +29 274
#note Gutsy, yes, but I didn't like the alternatives like RECCE. With no leave inference, Duck approves.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?FIMRST C3 FIRMeST +77 332
#note PZ: Being lazy, I miss MAFTIRS.
>Jason: ACEGLNR A3 GLANCER +86 360
#note Sooo glad this stayed open. When I drew the Z on the pick, my lead and the unlikelihood of Pete bingoing on this board given the pool had me seeing the finish line.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEGKNUV N1 GUNKE. +24 356
#note JI: Nice time for a phony. Obviously there was no way I could challenge here unless I was sure.
>Jason: AABINOZ 1K BIN.O +27 387
#note After almost 13 games to get here, I felt the tourney could come down to this play. Debated between AZAN at D1 (which I dismissed first), NAZI at J12 and this for about 10 minutes. I actually picked up the tiles to play NAZI, and changed my mind. In the end, I couldn't stomach Pete playing JUD(G)E. JADE(D) isn't bad ... he has three of NRTUV if it happens and probably trouble going out. I thought there might be a better fourth option I was missing and there was: BIZNA(G)A, which I will now never forget. I'll aso never forget the lesson learned from this play: If you have a biggie in the pre-endgame with a biggie unseen ... play off the biggie! (-25)
>Pete_Zeigler: ADENRUV 2J VAN +20 376
#note PZ: INVAR, which i saw, and was going to play wins sim. The problem is my time is just about out, and I have everything miscalculated.   JI: INVAR loses by five under optimal endgame play., but wins by one if I get lazy and play ZA at 2J.
>Jason: AAJTZ 5C .AJA +22 409
#note When I put the J next to the Z, my heart sank. It never occurred to me the J was in the bag. Now getting stuck with a biggie could cost me the tourney. After Pete blocked the Z setup, I looked for outs and saw RUED at D1. I cursed under my breath, knowing I'd have been home free after playing NAZI. I considered RAJ to block, but then saw (N)UDER lost by one. So, I considered RAJA, but figured that Z-stuck me. Looking in vain for another Z spot, I saw the ME_E and knew I was safe. But we each missed something. (-20)
>Pete_Zeigler: DERU 6F DE +14 390
#note PZ: I saw NUDER lost.  I missed H1 DURED and 14E TRUED.  being under 15 seconds, at this point, I'm not gonna beat myself up.  13 games of play, and I'm tired and I'll miss stuff.  So I did.  My play at least extends the game, and gives him a chance to screw up.  Seeing that it's winner wins the tourney, I'm OK with trying to do that.  Of course, I did it poorly and ineffectively, but that's beside the logic.  
>Jason: TZ 11K ..Z. +15 424
#note (M)ATZA the turn I played RAJA would've won; just whiffed and never considered outrunning RUED ... had I seen DURE(D) maybe I would've. Not the way I wanted to win the tourney, obviously. I know how much this game meant to Pete ... the type of game where we each said "good luck" to each other beforehand and meant it.
>Pete_Zeigler: RU 13I RU. +4 394
#note PZ: Missing FUR. Congrats Jason.   JI: Still impressive that he made the play in the one second he had left on his clock after DE. Thanks, Pete. Your day will come soon.
>Pete_Zeigler:  (T) +2 396
