>Gallant: ABEIILT -  +0 0
>Goofus: DGIKOPY 8H PIKOY +36 36
#note Wonder if he knows the extension PIKOYJAT.
>Gallant: ABEIIIT K8 .BIII +14 14
#note Glad they added this one in the last update.
>Goofus: DEGNTTW 12I TW.GNET +24 60
#note Aggressive, but since my word knowledge is way better than Gallant's, I prefer an open board.
>Gallant: AEEEGTT 9I TA.ET +23 37
#note So much for PIKOYJAT. I bet he thinks I don't know it.
>Goofus: DEILORS O5 RODLIES. +77 137
#note Yep, I'm the rodliest of them all, that's me pretty much.
>Gallant: ADEEEGU 7L EUE. +12 49
#note Off to a roaring start...briefly considered (T)EE(N)GUE, but that's just nuts.
>Goofus: ?ABCNOR 10C BACORNs +64 201
#note Jeez, another big miss, though a tough find: BANkCORP H1 89.
>Gallant: ADEFGNR N10 FE.ND +49 98
#note Better...if the E were another A I would have had FARADANG. Oh well.
>Goofus: AEGHNOT E5 GEOTA.H +52 253
#note Tell me that's not a sweet friggin' play there. Idiot Gallant held this for one minute exactly. He refuses to hold for longer than one minute, as he considers it an ungentlemanly abuse of the spirit of the rule. I like to belch. I bet he doesn't know that GEOTACH is an adjective only, either.
>Gallant: AEEGRRT 5E .ARGETER +70 168
#note I wish my opponent wouldn't belch on my time. Nevertheless, best bingo available.
>Goofus: AHINOUY C9 Y.UHA +34 287
#note Held back the I-hook too. I am Godd.
>Gallant: EELPRRS 4K PERL +20 188
#note I won a game by bingoing out with FORTRAN once.
>Goofus: IMNOOVV 14I VOIVO. +15 302
#note I once won a game by bingoing out with HATROSS.
>Gallant: DEIJRSZ H1 DEJI. +45 233
#note This or REZIG? They sim about the same, but I don't like that J.
>Goofus: AIMNNSU 3E MAN.U +16 318
#note Clearly setting up for QALA(MANJU)LAS later.
>Gallant: AACORSZ F2 Z.R. +33 266
#note Scoring consistently here, trying to be patient but it's getting late...
>Goofus: AFILNNS B11 FINN +26 344
>Goofus: AFILNNS --  -26 318
#note Dangit, I lost a turn to Sam K the same way. Stupid IH*.
>Gallant: AACOOSW N3 C.OW. +33 299
#note Good things in the pool, but I need to start drawing some. My favorite ice cream, I do believe, is peach-raspberry-vanilla.
>Goofus: AFILNNS 14B FINN +28 346
#note What I should have done anyway. Come on, blank...
>Gallant: AADIMOS F2 ....MIA +38 337
#note I'd forgotten about this extension until I drew the M and I, actually. Heart leapt to see it. 
>Goofus: ALLQSSX K14 .Q +11 357
#note Yeah, I could block DAVEnOUS, but I bet Mr. Nice Guy over there doesn't know it. No way I don't win with this rack, even with his blank.
>Gallant: ?ADEOSU 3K ADE.U +29 366
#note Oh, dear, I've done it again. I passed up the bingos, of course; it wouldn't be very sporting to just end the game so abruptly. But this play sets Goofus up for SLAX/DEJIGS/EL/TA/APEX for 47!
>Goofus: ALLSSX 7B SAL..X +22 379
#note I'm an idiot! Someone teach me how to play Scarbbleb! Never even looked at the SLAX spot. I'm going to go eat worms.
>Gallant: ?OS E5 .......yO.S +16 382
#note Put down HOSY/GEOTACHS* and was about to hit the clock, but Goofus went into this "oh, the tile gods hate me, I'm so doomed" routine - I knew he was trying to bait me into making this play; I bet he knows GEOTACH doesn't take an S. I wasn't sure, so I kept looking...ah, I said, there's another candidate that will suffice; very well, then.
>Gallant:  (LS) +4 386
#note See, yeah, that's what sucks about being Gallant. I always have to let the other guy go first.
