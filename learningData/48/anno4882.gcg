>Goofus: EINOORY 8G YONO +14 14
#note Best.
>Gallant: AEEHIJY G7 Y. +12 12
#note Sometimes the batter is required, like a jazz musician, to make an uncharted reach. Really should have played it at G8 instead, though: the threat of the Z back hook at 9G outweighs the threat of the X front hook at 7G.
>Goofus: EIILRWX 6C LIRIX +30 44
#note Better than just LIX in the same spot.
>Gallant: AEEHIJS E6 .AJHEE +32 44
#note Wish the I was an N for RAJNEESH!
>Goofus: EFORRVW J2 OVERFR.W +77 121
#note Revolutions happen in countries with widespread speech pathology, too, you know.
>Gallant: AIIILSS 3H LI.IASIS +74 118
#note Judging from his reaction to this play, Goofus cusses about a third as much as Darrell Day does.
>Goofus: EEEOTTT O3 .OTTEE +21 142
#note It's an alcoholic that doesn't take responsibility for his choice to buy booze. Or an Indian flower vase. I don't know.
>Gallant: DEEHMRT D2 HERM.D +27 145
#note THREMD 10D would be too much.
>Goofus: AAACEOT 2B OC.AEA +26 168
>Gallant: EIINNRT F9 INNIER +21 166
#note My bellybutton is the inniest.
>Goofus: AACEIRT H1 CE.IA +36 204
#note Zoned in on the OCHAEA/E hook and missed ERACIATE. Embarrassing.
>Gallant: BGLMOTU 13A GUMBO. +22 188
#note One off of GUMBOLET :( 
>Goofus: ADKNNRT B10 KNA.RD +42 246
#note Wasn't sure of this and almost settled for KNURD instead.
>Gallant: ADELSTU 11D D..TULASE +70 258
#note Nope, no "nice play", no nothing. Sometimes I wish I weren't too polite to point out that Goofus's mama rides to work on a pig.
>Goofus: ?BEINQT H10 B.QuIN +78 324
#note That'll do.
>Gallant: DGPPSVW L2 D.WG +18 276
#note Tough one. PPSV is terrible, but what else? Doesn't seem to be any better play through the E at 11L...
>Goofus: ?AEENTT L7 TEAT.NEd +66 390
#note Clearly better than (I)NTEATEd, though I win either way, despite obviously getting bagged like I always do.
>Gallant: FPPSUUV N8 PUPFUS +23 299
#note PUPFU comes out surprisingly high on O'Laugh's playability list for fives.
>Goofus: AGLOOTZ 15A O.ZOL +48 438
>Gallant: V 7L .V +9 308
>Gallant:  (AGT) +8 316
