#note Hard to fault Quackle too much for scoring 23 points on a tight board, but from this moment on it plays completely the wrong strategy.  With only one pointers, it starts dinking points with a tile here, a tile there.  However, it doesn't have a chance to get a bingo down, and without the scoring tiles it just lets me outrun it.  It should be looking for ways to play longer, both to open up bingo possibilities and to give it a chance to draw into the scoring tiles.

#note 15A INERT is way better.  Heck, even NITTY would be better.

#note INERT is still probably the best way.

#note Good enough, but best is OOT 14A threatening AERIE 11A or REAVE 2K to go out.
