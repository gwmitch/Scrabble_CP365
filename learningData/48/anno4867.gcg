#note Without the inference that Mike has no vowels, this play probably isn't worth making.

#note Not the draw I was hoping for.

#note Or HANG.
>Bing: AACEKMO 14I COMAKE. +34 260
#note Still in decent shape. MOCKER seemed overly risky.
>Mike: GHLMNOT 9E MONTH +31 297
#note MOTH is probably a fair bit better.

#note Missed bingo #4 for the tournament: sUB(T)ILIN 5B.
>Bing: DEEINTU 8A INDUE +26 376
#note Very tough. The bingo-prone tile pool makes playing at 8A dangerous, but I wasn't that all far ahead either. It's a similar position to my OCEAN play against Dackman. Sometimes these plays work out.
>Mike: ?EEILNU C1 UNvEILE. +68 406
#note I wanted to play through the N, to block all the lines. There's only one: jULIENNE. I know the word, of course, but how am I supposed to find it? Going through all the letters in the written-down EEILNNU? (which I did) won't help, because my brain just skips right past the J as impossible. I guess if I set up the -ENNE ending, I'll find it. (I had IN-, EN-, and -LINE set up.) As I've resigned myself to this, I say under my breath, "I hope you don't have it."

#note "I have it," Dave says. Drat! It's a good thing I have a win over Dave, otherwise I'd be pretty inconsolable after this. As it is, I'm only mildly ticked.
