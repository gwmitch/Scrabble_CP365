>MattyJ: AAIPRSU 8G PIU +10 10
#note pretty meh starting rack... chose piu to avoid s hookage.
>Quackle: ABDEIIO 7F BOA +13 13
>MattyJ: AAALORS 6E AAL +16 26
#note About the only good play on this rather awkward start.
>Quackle: DEEIIOR -EIIO +0 13
>MattyJ: ALLORSW 5C WALLS +31 57
#note Wasn't sure if it was worth it to use up my s here, but it's very possible I'd just use it up for even less the way this game's going. Don't like law/laws, too many hooks.
>Quackle: DEFLORR D1 FLOR. +24 37
>MattyJ: AACORUZ 1A ZAR. +48 105
#note Bad leaves seem to be a regular thing this game, so at this point I'm happy to make any decent scoring play.
>Quackle: DEEGQRR 2B GE.DER +28 65
>MattyJ: ?ACDGOU 1F DOC +23 128
#note Considered dago instead, but that created a possible bingo spot by hooking on the O, so played for defence.
>Quackle: EEHOQRX 3B OX. +44 109
>MattyJ: ?AGGIJU 4A AG +10 138
#note I probably just should have exchanged at this point. If your best play is 9 or 10 points with ugly crap leftover...
>Quackle: EEEHQRV 6A EVE +19 128
>MattyJ: ?GIIJOU B6 .IG +7 145
#note Now I'm just desperately trying to hang onto my lead while commiting suicide on my rack. I figured quackle didn't have an A to nab the TWS with only 3 left. Though Q still could make a horizontal word I suppose just not likely.
>Quackle: EEHNQRS I7 S.Q +30 158
>MattyJ: ?IJOSUV 10G JUS +23 168
#note Felt like a waste but really it's the only good option - I need to get a bingo with the blank I have, cause Q is probably going to throw one down any moment...
>Quackle: EEHNORT 11B THEREON +81 239
>MattyJ: ?EIORVY 8A O.IVE +39 207
#note Yeah I'm screwed. Also, I hate the letter Y. I can't ever find bingos with that letter, not that I have any anyways.
>Quackle: ?AADERS 3G AbRADES +72 311
>MattyJ: ?DEEORY 2J YOD +34 241
#note Knew that area was a bingo home sooner or later. Don't like yore/oyer, way too easy to score on the tws with ire/ore/are/ere. Yod only makes it possible with the O. And I have one... maybe eyed would have been the best play in that case.
>Quackle: ACEIKMN 4J MANIC +40 351
>MattyJ: ?EEMORU 12D MERE +34 275
#note Couldn't decide between mere and omer... ou? and 5 T's left unseen might have produced some kind of "out" bingo. But I wasn't confident I'd actually have a place to play it anyways. Regardless I just went for the points despite wanting to keep an e on my rack.
>Quackle: EIIKPTU J10 TUPIK +36 387
>MattyJ: ?BEFOTU 13C FUB +26 301
#note Happy with this play...
>Quackle: EHIINTW 5K HIT +36 423
>MattyJ: ?ENNOTY 13G YO +27 328
#note Yoni would have been perfect except only 2 letters left in the bag. My only chance to bingo is S hooking Tupik, unfortunately Quackle has a 100% chance of blocking that.
>Quackle: EIINNTW H13 .WN +18 441
>MattyJ: ?EINNTT K10 sTET +27 355
#note Didn't know either sitten or sennit, but rest assured I do now.
>Quackle: EIINT L11 EN +17 458
>MattyJ: INN C13 .IN +6 361
#note Yeah I can't even go out, although I gave quackle a place to go out. It wasn't really on my mind at the time, heh. As it turns out, I never at any point during the game had a bingo, not even a totally obscure one that only machines and machine-like players could find.
