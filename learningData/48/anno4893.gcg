>Snaggletoothed: CDEIRRT 8D DICTER +22 22
#note Quack says this or exch. DCERTT
>Wafflestompers: AEEMORY D2 MORAYE. +26 26
#note I bet Snaggle doesn't know this is an adjective only.
>Snaggletoothed: EHILOPR 5D .ERPHOIL +102 124
#note Nearly settled for PRO(DICTER) but then I remembered this from the PH/F interchangability list.
>Wafflestompers: EIINORU 2D .IOUE +9 35
#note Forgot if ENURII was good, but I'm so far back taking a big chance like this will pay off every time.
>Snaggletoothed: BEEKPTY J4 B.KEY +37 161
#note Grrr.  BE(A)KTYPE through an A, and KEP(I)BYTE almost fits.
>Wafflestompers: ?AEIINR 1H RIpIENA +77 112
#note Doesn't take an S, but RIPIENAE is good.  Or is it?  I don't know. Hopefully oppo doesn't know either.
>Snaggletoothed: CDEGPTT I7 P.EG +18 179
#note Couldn't decide what to do here.  Wasted seven minutes before settling for this.
>Wafflestompers: ?DEMSSU F8 .UMSeEDS +72 184
#note I didn't want to risk DUMnESS 2x2x because I couldn't recall if PREGE# was good in ours.
>Snaggletoothed: CDEERTT 8A CRE....... +54 233
>Wafflestompers: BEEFLOV 15A BLOVE. +45 229
#note FOVEABLE doesn't play
>Snaggletoothed: DEOSTTW 12A STOTW.ED +78 311
#note Or STOWTED/(PREG)S.  This keeps the board crunchier.  STOWTED was just too soft a play.
>Wafflestompers: AEFIOOQ B3 FOOQI. +38 267
#note It's an obscure plural for a shogunal shamanic cross-dressing healer's luandry washer's tree, in India.
>Snaggletoothed: AAGHITW N1 .WAIGH +42 353
#note No-brainer.  Spotted this instantly.
>Wafflestompers: AADEJNT 10I .ANJAED +20 287
#note If I were winning I'd probably block with 06 AJETA, but this offers volatility and keeps the board spiffy.
>Snaggletoothed: ANOTUXZ 13H OUTZAX +49 402
#note Phew, got away with this phoney.  Waffle said, "I hope you're not the kind of player that just makes up words and plays them".  Prick.
>Wafflestompers: AGINNTV L8 VA.IN. +40 327
#note If I challenged off OUTZAX* I probably could have won, but it sounded really familiar and I was down to three minutes.  Then I found this sweet play.
>Snaggletoothed: AALNRSU O8 AN.URALS +140 542
>Snaggletoothed: AALNRSU --  -140 402
#note Got greedy, but the game's not really in danger.
>Wafflestompers: FGINNTT H12 ..N +4 331
#note Hmm, I got to see my opponent's letters and determined the last tile in the bag was an A.  I try to set up DONT/TAFTING, but it'll probably get blocked.
>Snaggletoothed: AALNRSU 15H SAUNAL +36 438
#note best.
>Wafflestompers: FGILNTT A1 FLITT +37 368
#note Snaggle didn't even see my out-bingo.
>Snaggletoothed: R J13 .R. +5 443
>Snaggletoothed: R --  -5 438
#note wasn't sure.  Maybe I should review my 3's lol
>Wafflestompers: GN L8 ......N. +18 386
#note Made this play with one second on my clock!
>Snaggletoothed: R 6B .R. +15 453
#note Can't believe he didn't block this.
>Snaggletoothed:  (G) +4 457
