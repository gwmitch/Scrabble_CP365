#note 6 in a row best play until this turn.  Speedy player thinks my play sims close to the winner, B2 REKNOT, but I disagree.  I need to work on my parallel play vision

#note I considered breaking up my rack for JOINT, but decided to keep fishing.  Sim likes this, but I don't know.  I hate playing one tile at a time.  Help!

#note More hopelessness.  I like my play to open up more bingo lines, but this sims pretty low on championship.  WE 8A sims higher, which confuses me.  TWAIN M1 gives the highest Win%.   Help!

#note Very horrible miss.  Too concerned with opening another line.  QUIRT(S) or QUINT(S) is miles ahead.  QI 9C is also okay.

#note Championship player likes V(A)UNT.  I think I need to exchange.  I don't know what to exchange though.  Sim recommends exch ALL, or keep R;  Again, I am unsure.  Help!
