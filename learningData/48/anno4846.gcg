>Albert: ANUU H8 UNAU +8 8
>E._Tran: AILOOTY 9E LOO.Y +13 13
#note Nothing better jumps out.  Albert's previous play doesn't suggest he has any high point tiles from before.
>Albert: EEIOST E5 ETOI.ES +28 36
>E._Tran: AEIIRTU 6D E.UI +6 19
#note URAEI 10B is the star play.  I was debating between this and just TUI.  It's close.
>Albert: ?AADINT 5G ANTAcID +66 102

#note I miss a way cooler bingo here.
>Albert: ORSZ O7 .ROSZ +45 212
#note (U)TTERING
>E._Tran: ?EFIIJO 12M FIE +24 151
#note Tough rack to play through.  I really hate what JO(E) B6 does do the board, but sim likes it best.
>Albert: OOOO -OOOO +0 212
#note Hope!
>E._Tran: ?HIJLOU D4 JO. +22 173
#note Ugh.  Bad miss.  FUJI is so perfect.
>Albert: ENOPR 13I PRONE +30 242
>E._Tran: ?HILUVW M3 WU. +14 187
#note I draw VW.  Arrgh.  Nothing really looks good.  Sim against suggests VI(E)W, but I dont' want to close the board.  Kinda like LUV(S)
>Albert: AAB 7A ABA +17 259
>E._Tran: ?BHILVV 4L H.B +26 213
#note I now draw VB.  BUHL is a bit better.
>Albert: IQ 10M QI. +14 273
>E._Tran: ?ILSTVV -LVV +0 213
#note VIL(AYE)T is really cool.  V(AI)L is a possibility I saw and passed on.
>Albert: DEOO H1 ODEO. +21 294
>E._Tran: ?DEIIST A7 ..TIcISED +80 293
#note Albert plays a lot of SOWPODS.  Maybe he'll let this slide..
>Albert: LV 3G L.V +11 305
>E._Tran: AEEGKRX 2E AXE. +30 323
#note RAXED is better.  I should give more credence to V-C ratio.
>Albert: AALM 1D ALAM. +24 329
>E._Tran: EGHKLRS K11 GR.K +18 341
#note Sim agrees this is better than KEGS O1. I can save my S for next turn, and I eat up a vowel for him to play through.
>Albert: CDEFNRV 14K .ERF +30 359
>E._Tran: CEHLS O1 CELS +31 372
#note If the score were more lopsided, I'd be tempted to try LECHS
