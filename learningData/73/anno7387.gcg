#note It would be me and Carl the final 3 rounds.
>Carl: AFLOTTU D8 .OATFUL +24 24

>Bing: BEHORTX 4J HOTB.X +52 191
>Carl: ?GILNOR 13A fLO.RING +68 194
#note Carl: I didn't know FIERE#; any of several bingos at M6 is best.
>Bing: AEEKORR A8 KOA. +30 221
>Carl: AAAEGIM 12H AMIGA +23 217
#note C: RAGGA# H11 sims slightly better.
>Bing: EEORRSV F2 OVERRE.S +65 296
#note Unaccountably whiffed on REVERSO! Horrible miss, but I did draw a challenge (which would loom large).
>Bing: CDESUWY (challenge) +10 296

>Bing: ACIIIMT O1 MI +23 416
>Carl: AEINNNP 11J PANNE +26 428
#note C: While PANNE somewhat neutralizes the H10 hotspot, there are bigger fish to fry. Quackle says that taking out bingos and unloading an I with PINENE or PINNAE 4A is far superior to my play. 
>Bing: ACIIOST B3 SCOTIA +16 432
#note Missed COISTRIL C6 for the win. But wait, somehow we both had shorted Carl by 10 points.
>Carl: DINT 2E T.NDI +6 434
#note C: IDENT# 4D is best.
>Carl:  (I) +2 436
#note Final pseudo score: 432/426. Not one I'm proud of.
