#note matt held for a long time and eventually let go.  the real word that fits in this slot is (L)OTTE - but that leaves IIU vs my IU leave

>jc: IIISTUW F2 WITS +32 146
#note i completely whiffed on WI(Z). boy oh boy.  i figured that i'd take WITS over IWIS as there was one T left and I wanted some volatility.

#note i saw the 7 straight away but didnt like it as it only scored 68 and gave matt an easy comeback. also i wanted to use either row 1 or 15 for my ? bingo.  Matt thinks i should've played the bingo.   I was also pleased that i did see the only potential 8 with this rack - pity there was no A or L to play through.

#note matt held for about 2 minutes before challenging. before we checked he said "it'a nice play whatever'.  Q says the best legit play is k4 (O)KE.

>jc: DEEKOST 3C K. +12 305
#note with the DEEOST leave, i figured i draw to a 7 with an R or a V. The former having 2 spots for it and giving me 8s from the floating C, E or T. I also noted an L gave me an 8 from the C - so i liked fishing off the K.    Q prefers by 10% win to fish off KO(I).   DEEST?? makes more winning bingos i guess...
