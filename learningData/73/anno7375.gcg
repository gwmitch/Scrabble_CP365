>Bruce_Shuman: IQS 10F QIS +43 54
>Ryan_Fischer: AGOOSTU F10 .UOTA +16 64
#note OU(Z)O is decent.  I figured I would be fine with this 'cause he just spent his S.  Behind this is OUTGAS.  Wait, that's good?!  Talk about unplayable!  (Yeah, it's a verb.)
>Bruce_Shuman: CCO 12C COC. +16 70
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEGOS I7 O.E +13 77
#note Static eval doesn't get it quite right, but at least this does a little better in the sim.  Eval wants OGEES, (R)AGEE, or SEGO.  I want a bingo, thanks.
>Bruce_Shuman: EGPRU J9 PURGE +15 85
#note He took a really long time here, so I can't quite imagine what his other tiles were.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAEEGS 3G A.ErAGES +76 153
#note Of note: GEAr(C)ASE, AGEnES(I)A, SAl(V)AGEE.
>Bruce_Shuman: DIOR 14F .ROID +24 109
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IKOUXY C10 YU.K +26 179
#note This is pretty cool.  I love post-bingo racks like this (sometimes) for this eason.N1 mU(S)KOX 64, YUK for 29, OXY for 34.  I like mine.

#note BE(G)ONIaS is a bit better (L1 being the better spot).
>Bruce_Shuman: DEY 14B DYE +31 231
>Ryan_Fischer: FHJNOUW B8 JOW +38 347
#note 8A FUJ(I) 42.  Shouldn't have missed that.
>Bruce_Shuman: AGILNP 13I P.ALING +33 264
>Ryan_Fischer: EFFHLNU C1 HUFF +32 379
#note It plays at L5 for 6 more.  LUFF plays where mine played.  Of note: FUN(N)EL.
>Bruce_Shuman: ILOO O11 LO.OI +21 285
>Ryan_Fischer: ELLNRSV M12 V.LL +7 386
#note (E)LVER, but it empties the bag.  This is the best eval'ed play.  Champ chooses (E)VENS or (E)LVER.  *shrug*
