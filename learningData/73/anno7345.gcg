#note This play sims much better than plays like ONUS 5C or UNCOS 5B.  It was 2d best to ONO E10, which I didn't really consider.
>Joel: AFGN B10 GAN.F +26 64
>Dan: AADEMSS 5C AMASSED +85 139
#note Results-based analysis indicates that 5B would've been1 a better placement than 5C.  :)

>Dan: AAACIKT 4B IKAT +32 171
#note Quackle likes KATA 4A much better than any other option.  IKAT is virtually identical to TAKA 4A and TAKA/KATA A7.  I was deciding between IKAT and the A7 plays -- I don't like putting the K (or the T) there in the A4; it's much too easy to give back a 30+ point comeback play.

>Dan: AACEIIL A6 AECIAL +29 231
#note Championship player likes AECIAL best, followed my ILEA 6A (which I didn't consider) and ILEA 12L (which I did).  Then CILIA A6 and AZALEA 4G -- I almost played A(ZA)LEA, but the CII leave seemed dubious.
