>Tutor: AAEKNOS 8F OKA +14 14
#note To the Scrabble Public:  This game is intended anonymous - Tutor rated about 1650 - Pupil rated about 1000.  Tutor accepting a modest payment for hourly tutoring not including this analysis.    OKA at 8H or KOA at 8H would be better, since I have an N and an S for KOAS or OKAS or KOAN, and my opponent may not have the tiles to go there.
>Pupil: ?ADFILP 9F PILAF +25 25
#note PILAF is probably a good enough play but Quackle says FID is best (forming OF, KI, AD).  It only scores two points less and you will have more bingo plays the next turn if you keep PAL? instead of just D?.  The reason is that PLA has good "synergy", in other words the PL goes together often, and A goes well with both of them.
>Tutor: AACENOS 10B CANOE +22 36
#note Here CANOE is not a very great idea.  Quackle says AA is better (making AA and FA) because CONES is a very good leave.
>Pupil: ?DELNTW E10 .WN +12 37
#note Note that this note refers to the play that has just been made on the board, given just above, from the rack given above. - There are some bingos to find in DELNTW? here, making the blank an I,G,O, A, or S.  The best non-bingo play is LEWD under CANOE for 37 points keeping NT?.  
>Tutor: AAINSUY 12B YUA. +14 50
#note My rack is bad so I am just trying to cleaning it up - remove an unwanted U, a duplicate A, and the Y that can be difficult to bingo with.  I didn't think of playing UNSAY keeping AI because I want to keep the S if I can, and there will probably be an S hook on the board next turn (at least if i'm lucky).  Quackle likes this move (when I run Championship Player report on 0.96 unpatched).
>Pupil: ?DEEHLT 13C HE +22 59
#note There is a bingo to play in DEEHLT? somewhat common, slightly impolite, making the blank a C.
>Tutor: AIINOST 10I NAOI +15 65
#note I would be better off playing OI or AI for a few points less - very understandable since a good five-letter leave is always better than a decent three-letter leave.
>Pupil: ?DELRTT 7H DoTTREL +62 121
#note Besides DOTTREL there are also four ways you can play an 8 letter bingos through the I that I put out there.  The blank can be E, A, or B.  For the E and B it is a form of a common word, but maybe an unusual form.  For the A it is a form I did not know of a Latin word that I did know.
>Tutor: AIRSSTT 11G TSARIST +79 144
#note I thought it was more fun to play TSARIST with the overlap, but it wasn't as good a play in terms of scoring.
>Pupil: EEGPUUU 9L PUG +12 133
#note I would have simply exchanged probably, but Quackle says the best play is SEGUE for 21 points down from TSARIST.  You still have to deal with PUU leave the next turn though.  The best exchange seems to be throw back EGUUU and keep PE.
>Tutor: ?CNORTY H11 .CORN +30 174
#note Instead of SCORN Quackle says I should have played STROY, STORY, or STONY instead of SCORN and also COY or COR is better on 8M (ECU, LOG) than SCORN.  Reasons:  It is not very easy for me to bingo with a Y, and the C is better to keep for a bingo.  I guess you bingo along the triple line less often with a Y on 15H too.
>Pupil: EEEIIOU 8N OE +10 143
#note With 7 vowels I am sure I almost always exchange.  If I can keep 4 good vowels (no duplicates, not AIOU probably) without duplicates and somehow score 20+ with the other three then I would if it did not set up ZA for 66 or something.  But to keep fivevowels with duplicates and score ten points is definitely not worth it!
>Tutor: ?EESTWY 10N YE +29 203
#note Quackle says YE was best - it lists many 2 or 3 letter plays that give the tutor about 90% estimated winning probability (but it is not a very reliable estimate when the players are imperfect).  The leave WEST? should have a bingo soon on this board if it stays open enough.  Pupil may want to consider closing it if it's doable.  
>Pupil: EEIIJMU G13 JEU +39 182
#note Here Pupil chose the best play JEU, scoring fine and helping the rack and the board too.
>Tutor: ?EEQSTW 6I WE +15 218
#note In the game when I drew the Q I made a face since the tiles came in a slightly bad order to not allow me to put QWERTY anywhere.  There is noplace all to put the Q (don't want to use up the blank unless I can score well with it).  I started to play EW(ER) for 15 points but I didn't like the opening along the bottom row.  This way if Pupil scores on the row above WE then it might give me a good place for the Q.  Tutor failed to see that WE could score 29 points making JOW and ERE (this is one time it didn't pay at all to be thinking too hard about bingos).  Quackle's favorite play is (E)TWEES for 39 points down to the corner (I didn't spot that either).  A good idea here is to use up tiles to get an I, U, or A to use with the Q.
>Pupil: EEGIIMN 5J MIG +17 199
#note This may be a good place to put MIG on the board since it prevents me from using that spot - but it isn't very good to keep EEIN in the rack, probably.  You might draw the X and get to play EXINE I guess.  It would balance the rack better to play GIE since then you don't have duplicates, and equal vowels and consonants MINE.   (I should make sure the Pupil understands about vowels and consonant balance.)
>Tutor: ?EFQRST K4 Q. +11 229
#note Quackle says Q(I) is best.  If I had thought about this more I might have played QAT (making  QI and aG) for 37.  Quackle's third favorite choice is to exchange the F and Q and keep REST? which is probably my favorite bingo leave (a little short on vowels though - but look at the fairly high number of Is, Es, and As in the pool.)
>Pupil: BEEGIIN L3 BI. +34 233
>Tutor: ?AEFRST 15G ..FAiREST +86 315
#note There happen to be two other bingos with this rack, with 8 letters playing down to the N in CANOE, but they don't score as much.  I didn't look for them so I don't know whether I would have found them. 
>Pupil: EEGLNNO 14K LONE +17 250
#note Quackle says you made the BEST move here!  This time you were smarter than me, since I picked this one out to criticize it - but with your leave EGN and the board the way it is, I didn't see a very decent way you could open the board to try to catch up with a bingo.  Neither does Quackle.  Pupil's "bogo-win" is only about 3% after LONE but the other options are worse.
>Tutor: DIIMORR 7D RIM +13 328
#note Tutor was being somewhat generous with this play.  The idea was to rid the rack of duplicate R and I.  Missed IRIDOLOGY (involves diagnosing health by inspecting the irises) and MIDIRON (a golf club).
>Pupil: ADEGINX C5 DIG +16 266
#note Here Pupil revealed the rack to the Tutor and Tutor recommended the setup.  Then it would have been morally wrong to disturb the setup!  Quackle likes AXING/GIRD better, and EXING/GIRD best (because of HEXING hook I think).
>Tutor: DIIORUV -DIIORUV +0 328
#note DIIORUV - I didn't see any good plays and I wanted to try to draw some sweet tiles like the Z or S if they were still there.  I missed IRIDOLOGY again.
>Pupil: ABEHNXZ B4 ZAX +63 329
#note In the game I just thought "I'm not sure if that is best" because you might be able to score best using the Z and X separately.  Quackle says the very best chance is to play HAZE on 12L making PISH and TA - it scores 54 and your X setup will probably be there next turn (all you have to do is draw a vowel) possibly for a very high score (if you can make a 5 ending in X there).   Quackle probably underestimates the probability that a human player would block the hot spot.
>Tutor: ADEEOTV D2 VETO +18 346
#note Now that the game is so close it's a difficult pre endgame.  Not sure what the best play was.  Quackle likes VOE M1 or VOTED D1 (forming ADD) but it may be suffering from an endgame glitch.
>Pupil: BDEHLNV 3C V.ND +16 345
#note seems pretty sensible, except B and H are hard to use together.  
>Tutor: ADEIISU M2 DIS +28 374
#note Quackle 0.96 in the Championship Player Full Game Report says if Pupil plays the best play then I definitely should have put IS (100% win percentage) vs. 0% win percentage for all other choices.   To do a fuller analysis would be good practice for endgames.
>Pupil: BEHLOR 13L BORE +26 371
#note Of course BOR is not a word! - HO is a good choice according to Quackle.  But I am not sure about Quackle's endgame at all, since it seems to be reporting the Winning % inconsistently.  I really need to get the patched version.
>Tutor: AEIU 2D .IA +15 389
#note Looks like I can go out in two and win since I can play DUE next and the H and L don't go together well.
>Pupil: HL 14F H.. +14 385
>Tutor: EU 2M .UE +8 397
>Tutor:  (L) +2 399
#note We both went a minute over so the final score should have read 375-389.  Tutor barely escapes with pride intact
