#note Missing a pair of double-doubles, ELEVONS, and KEELSON. Duck likes the former by about a point, even though it scores four points less.

#note Missing the 2x2 ANTIARIN on row 5.

#note This play doesn't even show up on C-player's radar, which surprises me. It likes 9K TEGG, marking it as a winner 22 percent of the time. It's next best play is to exchange 6 to the R, about three-quarters of a point back in wp, and five back in valuation. I considered RITZ holding back the F-hook, but felt it would offten be blocked anyway, and I also felt I needed another chance at pulling a vowel out of the bag.
>Chuck: MTU 5D MUT. +12 307
>Steve: EGGILST 14I GIGLETS +75 359
#note This word looked familiar enough to take a chance on given the circumstance of the score. Chuck flashed his rack to me afterwards, bemoaning his nongo. DECOROU-S.
>Chuck: CDEOORU 4A DURO +22 329
#note Duck likes 13M DUO, but I like this aggressive play from Chuck to open another 3x3 line. 
>Steve: BDIINRS A1 BIN. +21 380
#note Playing at O1 DIBS is the correct play. It wins 92 percent of the time. Unfortunately, I wasn't sure INTARSIA took the S hook.
>Chuck: CCEEHLO O8 CLOCHE. +54 383
#note Best. Chuck is now just under 51 percent to win according to the sim.
>Steve: BDEINRS 5J BE.DS +29 409
#note Computer's top plays all use just one tile, starting with F13 PAN. Hard for me to reconcile; my thought was to try and win by outscoring. The S didn't seem to hold enough value for keeping, and I thought I'd have a better chance at going out next time by dumping it. 
>Chuck: ADEEMPV A10 VAMP +23 406
#note 2A IMPED is best since it takes out my out play, (which I didn't see/know,) and sets up MAUVE to tie, given optimum play. Chuck can gamble for the win with 13F PAVE followed by K9 MEED if he wants to assume he'll get another turn and that I won't know/play BRIONY.
>Steve: INORY 3C OY +22 431
#note Not knowing BRIONY there are two other winning sequences. 3D YIRR takes Chuck's best out play away.
>Chuck: DEE F1 DEE +15 421
>Chuck:  (INR) +6 427
