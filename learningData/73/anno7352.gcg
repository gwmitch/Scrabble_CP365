#note Great. "Strongest" opponent in the field, and he has the strongest oppening play of all the others.
>Winter: GIIOTUX 7F XI +25 25
#note While my rack sucks.

>Glenn_Filzer: BDERTTU --  -80 54
#note GODDAMN IT!!! Except Adam, none of my opponents could get anything going, while I had great racks. I suspect he has NO IDEA if this is good. He's just guessing. But that guess could cost me the game, depending on whether it's a lucky or unlucky guess.
>Winter: AAIOSTV F5 TA.. +20 56
#note Don't want to create any opening for him, since he's already shown he doesn't have a good play otherwise. Quack likes (L)AVA, which is stupid b/c it gives back (A)BUTTED or (A)BUTTER and allows him to turn over a lot of tiles. Shoulda played VIA, however.

#note Dang, HABU. Expensive mistake given that one additional non-vowel could have made a huge difference.

>Winter: EILNOUU M10 .LUON +12 251
#note Yeah, another consonant here might have made a huge diff.

#note Crap.	
>Winter: ?EIOORU 3G O. +3 295
#note Given the tile pool, I don't see how I can't win if I Q stick him. There's a U at 12L, but I have to assume he did not have the Q when he played ZA, and he's only drawn 2 tiles.
>Glenn_Filzer: DEEW 2J WED.E +32 344
#note Now he's so far ahead a Q block seems critical.
>Winter: ?EHIORU N12 HIE +23 318
#note I don't understand Quackle here. Blocking the Q is obvious, especially after Glenn looked at his tiles and mumbled something to indicate he had drawn it. Other players might try to pretend, but I don't see Glenn pulling something like that.
>Glenn_Filzer: PW 4L P.W +16 360
>Winter: ?ALOORU K1 R. +2 320
#note I blew it big time here. I saw TROP and blocked, but I didn't see STROP. I should have played (WEDGE)R*, even though I suspected it was no good.
