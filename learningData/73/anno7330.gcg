#note TROW 9D wins, and Quackle is right.  I shouldn't hold the T and leave the multitude of easy hooks available.  Not sure why I held the T.  Surprisingly I'm not even docked 2 points here.

#note Best.  Other options worth consideration are FORE and FORTE in the same location.

>Jim_Burlant: DEELORS 15A RESOLED +83 182
#note I saw the K8 placement for 82 and thought that it was worth the extra point to take out the triple line.   CP agrees with me, as this play wins; the K8 placement trails by a little more than 2 points.

>Jim_Burlant: AAGJNTZ H11 AZAN +27 209
#note I considered 2 plays:  JAW G7 and this choice, and neither one thrilled me.  Normally, I'd unload the J and keep the Z but that didn't seem viable given the available options.  I chose AZAN for three reasons:  turnover; it scored respectably; the nunber of potentially dangerous comebacks were very limited.  Q doesn't like this play at all, docking me almost 11 points. Q prefers K11 ANGA, presumably to set up the Z for the next turn.  Q says nothing comes within 7 points of ANGA.  I don't think I'd have put down ANTA or ANGA - even if I had looked for them and found them, which I didn't.   I consider AZAN a reasonable play - not great, not horrible - but still prefer it to a needlessly volatile setup like ANGA/ANTA that could easily backfire and/or be snuffed out.

>Jim_Burlant: ACEGJNT L1 JEAN +46 255
#note Three plays lead the pack:  this choice, JAG L2, or CATJANG 4G.  I didn't know CATJANG, and the question is, given this board and tile pool, how many points is too many to give up for the sake of preserving CENT?  According to Quackle, it's a wash - on a valuation basis, these three choices all evaluate within 0.7 points of each other, with JEAN having the highest win percentage.   Two things swayed me towards JEAN.  First, 14 points was just a little too much to give up on the scoreboard; secondly, since AAAAEEEEEEEENNNN were still unseen I thought I had a very high probability of getting back the bingo prone tiles I was burning.  If, for argument's sake, the pool only showed AAAAEEN remaining, JAG would have been my choice.

#note Wow - who knows the 9 that I didn't find on row 4?  Having said that, while this play coughs up huge equity to the bingo I didn't know, CP says this play has the highest win percentage of any possible option, winning 1% more often than the bingo.
