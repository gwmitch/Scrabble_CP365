#note Sheesh, I lost to someone who plays the word, misses its anagram.  Sometimes Q is just salt in the wound!

#note I thought this was phony!

#note Of course.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADIILSZ 4H .ZALID +32 209
#note LAZI(E)D, but it kills the S and E lines.  DIAZI(N)'s a bit better; surprised (O)ZALID is so low.

#note Lost challenge.  (You gotta be @#&!$ kidding me with this draw.)
>Joe_Seeyah: IQ 3L QI +39 387
#note Not to mention that draw.
>Ryan_Fischer: IIIJNSY 5E JIN. +22 231
#note J(O)Y, yes, but where does triple-I-N-S go?  Not that IISY goes anywhere either.
>Joe_Seeyah: EHM M11 HEM. +40 427
#note Kay, STOP IT!
>Ryan_Fischer: GIIMSTY I4 .IT +26 257
#note Surprisingly not that bad, though ZIG is better.  Can't believe I overlooked that.
>Joe_Seeyah: CDENOTU 1G T.OUNCED +64 491
#note That about sums it up.  He has DUEC(E)NTO and CO(R)NUTED too!

>Ryan_Fischer: EEIKOSY 9L .O. +8 290
#note This sets up my S and Y.  One of the few bright moments of this game, and a pretty clever play, I think.  I wish I could find stuff like this when the game depended on it.  Champ doesn'tfind it.   Says to empty the bag with M8 YO, which, I guess, could lead to a bingo. I'm happy that FOG wins the sim handily by ~2 points.  Yay!
>Joe_Seeyah: EGIV 2D VEGI. +15 528
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIKRSY O5 REKEY +47 337
#note Although... REKEYS' anagram is KERSEY.  At least I didn't try KEYERS.  :(  And I should NOT have missed KYRIES.  Dejected and all.  KYES too.  58 for that!  Champ says dump the I at 14E then go out with KERSEY.  I'm not exactly sure why.  I chose REKEY to save the S.  DIS/QIS is decent.
