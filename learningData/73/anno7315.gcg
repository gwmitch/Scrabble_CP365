>trashman: ADEMOTZ H4 MATZO +38 38
#note Chicago tourney, 10/10. Missed AZOTED 52. Not a good way to start, and as will be seen, it didn't end well, either...
>Mark_Kenas: OWY 6H .OWY +18 18
>trashman: DEEERUY 7H .EE +21 59
#note Best
>Mark_Kenas: IO 5K OI +14 32
>trashman: CDEPRUY 8J DUPERY +52 111
#note Slightly better than DECURY, according to Q
>Mark_Kenas: EE 4G E.E +5 37
>trashman: AACORUV O3 COVAR. +15 126
#note Struggled with this play. 3C VACUA for 25 is best, J2 VAU for 20 not far behind. Things go downhill fast from this point...
>Mark_Kenas: ACEINST 9C CINEAST +81 118
>trashman: AEGIRUV C9 .URVE +20 146
#note J2 VAU still the best option, scoring the same but keeping the E, and not giving so many potential hooks...
>Mark_Kenas: AINNOPT 3A PINTANO +73 191
>trashman: AADGIIT 14A GADI +24 170
#note Struggled again on this play, and started getting into time trouble. Q agrees, though, but Q's next best play, F2 INDAGATE for 23, gets 37 style points. There are no options whatsoever with the P, so let's open another juicy spot...
>Mark_Kenas: IX 10F XI +52 243
#note Sigh...
>trashman: AAEGIIT A12 GI.A +24 194
#note Again took a while on this turn. I'm now under 5 minutes. Q agrees.
>Mark_Kenas: KUW E2 W.UK +22 265
>trashman: ?AEHIOT N6 HO.A +30 224
#note Saw A1 TOPHI for 42, which Q likes best, but wanted to bingo. Saw ACHIOTE, but thought it didn't play, missing the 10I spot. Argh. Also missed N6 AEROLITH for 68. Under 4 minutes now, and playing panicky. 
>Mark_Kenas: ?DDEIOT 15D DElTOID +85 350
#note I pretty much need to triple-triple now...
>trashman: ?EHILST A3 .HILTErS +98 322
#note And I miss 2 triple-triples, which would've most likely won the game. Gave up too quickly on this play, and it cost me the game. What were the plays?
>Mark_Kenas: EFORR 3I FRORE +33 383
#note HAPLITES/HOPLITES for 167. Mark ended up winning the tourney, but I gift-wrapped this one for him...
>trashman: ABLNNQR B2 Q. +22 344
#note Missing I9 TRANQ. Under 2 minutes now, and still 9 tiles in the bag.
>Mark_Kenas: BNS M6 SN.B +27 410
>Mark_Kenas: BNS --  -27 383
#note SNEB#. Maybe I can still pull this one out?
>trashman: ABELNNR L8 .LANNER +18 362
#note Saw 14I BANNER for 11 more, but wanted some extra lanes to hope for a miracle. Even though Mark has one or two S's, there aren't many vowels left. I'm under a minute on the clock, though, and am ready to concede defeat...
>Mark_Kenas: BGINS 13H BING.S +20 403
#note Mark doesn't take the bait, and seals the deal...
>trashman: ABEFJLU 12G JAB +22 384
#note At 2K for 5 more, but I'm under :30 now, and decide not to give him the easy S play
>Mark_Kenas: LMST 10K T.MS +18 421
