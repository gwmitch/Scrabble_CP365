#note PROTAMIN leaves 8A plays to the Y open, but MONITOR creates a good scoring opportunity for the S with several unseen...I wasn't sure which way to go, but in this case MONITOR looks like it would have worked out better. Sim favors PROTAMIN.

#note Whiffed on 2L WYTE. I considered PEWTERS and decided against it, but it scores the most and is the most defensive play...not a bad combo.
