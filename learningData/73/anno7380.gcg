#note Should've been EQUALE(D) which I of course saw.  I just didn't want to give bac an easy 40 points.  Overthought things here.  If I was gonna go this route, I should've played REAL, as this allows a later bingo.

#note Excellent play which really puts me in a quandary considering the bag contents.

#note Looks like I mistracked a bit.  I had an O still missing instead of two As, making it even mo Looks like Champ has no clue either, suggesting K(A) is my best bet, winning 25%.re likely he'd bingo.  I couldn't figure out how to stop the bingo threat and score enough to catch him.  CAKE is indeed the best play, thought that's of little consolation.  I played the game near perfectly, but lost it early on, neglecting to get rid of the Q when I could.
