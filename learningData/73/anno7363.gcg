#note TAXMEN! That's like a bingo miss.
>Mason_Shambach: EEINRTU 14H REUNITE +74 222
>Jason: BDEEETT A5 BEET +26 221
#note Unsure of BETTED. Chose this over 15F because I didn't want a bad board after Mason took the hot spot in the lower right. This kept things more open for bingos, and I liked my chances of bingoing first.
>Mason_Shambach: BJO 13G JOB +32 254
>Jason: DEHNOQT H11 TH..N +36 257
#note Close. THORO instead. Keeping the D for Q(A)ID for 47 at the top, which is a probable draw and probably won't be blocked given the board configuration.
>Mason_Shambach: AISV O12 VISA +41 295
>Jason: ADENOQS M12 QA. +24 281
#note Guess the first tile I looked after giving up on Q(A)ID and ditching the Q?

#note "You weren't supposed to do that," Mason said. Felt home free, but Mason didn't go quietly.
>Mason_Shambach: ACE 1L CA.E +33 361
>Jason: EGILOOW 15D WOOI.G +20 399
#note Concerned about potential -INGS bingos given the pool, and felt like the five points/not blocking column A sacrifice was worth it. CP approves.
>Mason_Shambach: ?AFGIPU A13 FUG +28 389
>Jason: ELRRS 6I LE. +16 415
#note Considered EL(L)S at G6 and RE at C13, both of which would force Mason to find 23 to tie, 24 to win. Nearly played RE to block PIlA(W). With time to double-check everything, finally saw PI(K)As and was horrified to score it as 24. ELS/LES at 6F didn't work either; then oKAPI wins by one. LE(K) seemed necessary but wrong at first, until I saw the out play with RRS at C5. And when Mason's shoulders slumped when I put LE(K) down, I knew he'd seen PIKAS too. Turns out LEK and (PRY)ERS are the only wins. Phew!
