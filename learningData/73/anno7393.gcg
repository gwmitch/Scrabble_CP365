#note Really considered passing up bingo, but given the board, a win seemed assured if I bingoed, and I already had enough spread.

#note Now it looks REALLY bad for me. I can lose this if she scores with the Q and I can't go out, and I can lose if I get Q stuck. I can't find a surefire way score and guarantee I won't get stock, so I decide to deprive her of the LOOM hook. I don't even look, or see, her deadly Q play.
