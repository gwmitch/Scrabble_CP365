>Chad_Harris: EO H8 .OE +10 30
#note I think he had PROTEOSE in some manner here, but wasn't sure of it.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNSX 11C XENIAS +37 57
#note Racks like this suck.  Especially when your opp just fished.
>Chad_Harris: ?AEORRT 6C ROAsTER. +57 87
#note Not many awesome plays.  Best is hard to find.  pERORAT(E) or OvERRAT(E).  Of note: p(E)R(F)ORATE!
>Ryan_Fischer: IIMNVWW D9 VI.W +20 77
#note Well, that's a pretty crazy 6-tile draw!  VIM or VIM(E)N Q likes better.  Meh.
>Chad_Harris: BOY 13B BOY +30 117
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILMNW 5B MEWL +29 106
#note MAW or MEW sucks.  Missed LAWIN(E).  Surprised this is so far down.
>Chad_Harris: ADEI K10 AIDE +15 132
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEINOV 13I VE.NA +24 130
#note Wholly shit: 7C ENVOI 30 (!!!)  NAEVI fits one left, too.  I knew this was bad when I played it.  Still have trouble getting away from vowel-heavy racks.
>Chad_Harris: AK 10F KA. +35 167
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAIORR 14L OAR +10 140
#note ROsARIA won't go down.  Trying to figure out the best place to score with OAR.  14 A is just too risky.  14L... a little less so.
>Chad_Harris: UU -UU +0 167
#note Got luck on that one!
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEEFIR O8 FAERIEs +83 223
#note lEAFIER is 84
>Chad_Harris: EGINOT 15G TOEING +33 200
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDIOPU N9 APO +25 248
#note Feh!  ODIU(M) is out. UPDO, I considered, but past for reasons unknown.
>Chad_Harris: ESTZ 4A ZEST +65 265
>Ryan_Fischer: BDDGINU L4 BUDDING +83 331
#note We all have our share of crazy luck.  I'd like to think I'd find BUDGI(E) if BUDDING wasn't available.
>Chad_Harris: HHN 5K H.NH +20 285
#note HUNH?!
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGLNTY 14A CAY +29 360
#note What's the opposite of GLYCAN?  GLYCANT!  Haha.  I spent a while looking for plays through the H.  Found YACHT, didn't get LATHY.  Oops.  Still, I prefer not giving anything, so CAY is o-cay.  Yay, puns.
>Chad_Harris: DIL H3 IDL. +7 292
#note Nice setup.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGLMNOT G3 MO +17 377
#note With 5 tiles left in the bag, Champ's of little help.  Gotta block, and it's easier to end in S than start, so we'll go with that.  MELO(N), MONT(H), and MENO are crazy.
>Chad_Harris: IQU A1 QUI. +66 358
#note Did *NOT* see that coming!  Though I guess I should have.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILNST 2H SINGLET +76 453
#note Holy luckbox, Batman!  Did NOT see that ending coming!
