>Adam_Townsend: INORSTU L5 NITROUS +74 98
#note That's fine. I have the blank, and he missed the higher scoring play.
>Winter: ?AAAINO 8L .AIA +12 83
#note Woulda been nice if I could have bingoed right away, but I'm not worried.
>Adam_Townsend: AEGNORST 5E ESTRAGO. +86 184
#note Okay, that's annoying, but I'm going to bingo and I can outplay him on a tight board.
>Winter: ?AEENOOR 7C OREgANO +73 156
>Adam_Townsend: AEILMNR 9B MANLIER +71 255
#note I get killer draws against opponents #4-8, and when I get to the one who has caused me trouble in the past, he gets three in a row??>
>Winter: ADENNRS N8 .NSNARED +72 228
#note If not for this, I would have lost. Adam would have closed up those lines, and this board is all but dead.
>Adam_Townsend: EEM O13 EME +30 285
#note I still need for him have a bad rack.
>Winter: AADHIOV 8A HAD +29 257
>Adam_Townsend: BJO F2 JOB. +29 314
#note Oh boy.	
>Winter: AINOTUV 3A OVATI.N +22 279
#note Didn't see INVA(R) and considered (L)UV, but finally decided I needed to draw some remaining power tiles before Adam got his grubby hands on them.
>Adam_Townsend: FI 10E IF +28 342
#note Relentless.
>Winter: AEKUWYZ D1 YU.Z +40 319
#note Didn't see AW(O)KE, but I probably don't play it because of the horrible leave. There's only one A left, and not that many Es, so I think I'm better off keeping them.
>Adam_Townsend: CGL A1 CL.G +27 369
>Winter: AEEEFKW M12 KEF +40 359
#note Finally catch a break and manage to tie the game. But if he draws the blank...
>Adam_Townsend: CEHIL 11A CHILE +26 395
>Winter: ?ABEERW A11 .AWER +33 392
#note Tough, tough call. I see (C)ABER first, but obviously (C)AWER* scores 3 more, critical, and the B is probably better for going out than the W. I strongly suspect it's phony, but I decided I need to chance it. Quack likes ditching one or two tiles, but that's stupid b/c if I draw a bingo Adam just blocks. I NEED the points.
>Adam_Townsend: DOPSTUX M3 POST +24 419
>Winter: ?BEIT O4 TiBI.E +10 402
#note Well, I survived, but just barely. If I can't go out in two spots, I lose. Why must I always have the worse luck against the best players???
