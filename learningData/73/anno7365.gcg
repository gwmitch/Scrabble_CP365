#note Alex then claimed that I'd "drawn everything." Perhaps it worked; I saw none of the last four power tiles.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AENORRS 2I SERRANO +72 194

>Jason: EGLNOTW E12 WELT +23 368
#note WO(V)EN is one better, except that I thought he had no out and was trying to guarantee an out myself.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AISV 14J VISA +23 346
#note Thinking Alex had VAIR, I was surprised to see this go down. Fortunately my mistracking didn't cost me.
