#note Oh yeah, a 22-point lead on a wide-open board is a great great to burn some high-prob tiles.

#note Okay, that's a good play. Still, that fact in no way mitigate the luck that permeated this game. 
>Winter: DEGKLUZ 7I KUGEL +35 167
#note Hmm... I wonder if my opponent would have managed to make this play instead of ditching the Z.

>Winter: ?ADDOTZ C9 ZO.Al +67 234
#note Quack likes ZO(E)A, which is ridiculous given that I could smell David's luck dripping off him. Of course he's going to have an E or S. No, I needed to take the points, cut the spread to about 20, and hope to catch up with the Q, J, X, or esses.

#note No idea if this is good, but I have to get something going.

#note AWESOME FIND!!!
>Winter: ADGGIRY 14F GR.DY +22 330
#note I hate to empty the bag, but I'm gambling everything on two things--drawing the J and David getting stuck with the Q. And given his luck and the tile pool, I wouldn't put it past him to draw into a bingo through the O or D.
>David_Jones: AMT 6L TAM +17 422
#note Nice. He gives up 10 points to block, not realizing I had the J play in two spots.
>Winter: AGIJLNQ B6 JAG +58 388
#note Now I blundered. I could have played QI(S) first, but I saw an out play (N)ISEI, and I foolishly assumed that he would actually find it, so I took the J play.
>David_Jones: EIIS M11 I.IS +8 430
#note AWESOME PLAY!!!
>Winter: ILNQ 13A NI.L +3 391
#note Even as I'm playing NI(L)L I know I can do better without playing all my tiles, but I'm so pissed I don't even care.
