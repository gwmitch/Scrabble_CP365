#note I figured this board was closed enough that I didn't mind keeping the Q and scoring a little. Of course, this was before I realized that ABYS took an S. Exchanging DLQ sims best.

#note I spent forever confirming there were no bingos here, and then I ended up rushing the "so what the hell do I play?" step. Missing RAKI 5D, which would be costly. Only a nine-point mistake equity-wise, but...
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?ADDGIW 5F WADDInG +80 291
#note ...his only bingo plays in that spot. Awesome.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ACEINO 3G CApONIE. +74 292
#note This sims best, although you could make the argument that at a tempo disadvantage, it's better to play BONIFACE B2 for the same score with more volatility.

#note This seemed obvious to me, but CP suggests dumping the V first with VAIL L12. That way I can play either ZAIRE or FRITZ B6 for 37 next turn.
