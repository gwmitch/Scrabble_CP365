>Winter: EFIOOT 8D FOOTIE +26 26
#note Unsure, and rather foolish to try against Chris, but what the hell.
>Chris_Williams: ?AAEIRR D5 AIR.AREs +70 70
#note I'M GOING TO LOSE AGAINST ALL THE TOP THREE PLAYERS!!!
>Winter: CEEIUVZ E1 CUVEE +24 50
#note Favor this over VICE to give me an extra shot at an A for ZA, to ditch the U, and to distract Chris from C9.
>Chris_Williams: AAFNU C11 FAUNA +22 92
#note Oh... my... god!
>Winter: ADEGITZ 15A AG.TIZED +230 280
#note As soon as I saw the rack I started hoping Chris would play an A at 1A or 1B, as there are TWENTY-SIX possibilities, but never in my wildest dreams did I think he'd give me the triple-triple!!! NINE YEARS AND OVER 3289 GAMES I HAD TO WAIT FOR THIS MOMENT!!!

>Winter: DEIKOST I7 D.KE +34 338
#note Damn, he could catch up easily--gotta keep scoring!!!
>Chris_Williams: AAGINU K1 IGUANA +18 220
#note NOOOOO!!! HE BLOCKED MY BINGO!!!
>Winter: GILOSTU L4 LUG +20 358
#note IOST yielded a bingo last time, so let's try it again.
>Chris_Williams: MNOT 2B NOT.M +36 256
#note Dude knows his words.
>Winter: EIOORST M6 SOOTIER +66 424
#note Whew! Feel safer now. Cheap, but I'll take it.
>Chris_Williams: EVX 3A VEX +46 302
#note Chris isn't going to give up, is he? With blank unseen, my win is NOT assured.
>Winter: BEHLNRS 3I BL.SH +31 455
#note At this point I notice the dearth of vowels in the pool and adjust accordingly. I forgo 8L in favor of turnover and so I don't open up a line for him. Quack hates this tho.
>Chris_Williams: CILY 1K .CILY +39 341
#note Heeeee's stiiiiill scoring!
>Winter: EHLNORS 8L H.RN +33 488
#note Gotta take the points now, even if I open a line.
>Chris_Williams: DDTT 11I D.TT.D +27 368
#note Interesting.
>Winter: ?EILOSW 11C ..W +18 506
#note This is kinda obvious. A win is assured even if I empty the bag with a bingo and draw the J or Q and get stuck, but by leaving a tile in the bag I increase my chances that Chris will play just one tile and that I'll catch him with a full rack. I'm trying for high score ever now, which might be possible if I catch his Q, J, P, and W.
