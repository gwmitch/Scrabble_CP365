>Jim_Burlant: AADELSW E10 WALE +25 107
#note Don't know why on earth I broke up this promising rack.  E10 WAD was definitely the play.  This is poor.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADEILOT I7 I.OLATED +62 80
>Jim_Burlant: AADFNSU C3 FAUNA. +23 130
#note I saw H13 FAD, but this is where the strain of the day was catching up to me.  At least three other times this day, I had unloaded a U, only to see another U as one of the first two tiles out of the bag, so I wanted to unload the U.  This is decent, but it's definitely not best - that honor goes to C3 UNSAFE.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BEIX H12 IBEX +52 132
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDMOSS H2 eMBOSS.D +70 200
#note And after several minutes, I find it.  The other playable bingo is DISBOSOM.  But this is best and it wins 75%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIQT 5B Q.ITE +28 160
>Jim_Burlant: CDIOORW G12 DOW +25 225
#note Solid choice - either this or 14B WOOD is the play.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: MPPU C10 PUMP +36 196
>Jim_Burlant: CIINORR 14D CRO... +22 247
#note  I didn't want to open up, which ruled out plays like MICRON or BORIC.  I figured that Sam would probably extend something on rows 2-5 on his next turn, and I was hoping to put down a defensive rack dump to clear out the garbage on my next turn.   Quackle prefers 6A RIN, which I didn't like,  by quite a bit - the rest of the choices (of which this is one) are a matter of style preference, as they all sim within 2 points of each other.  What I liked about this despite the leave was that it gave absolutely nothing back.    But this didn't quite work out as planned.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AHY I3 YAH +33 229
>Jim_Burlant: IINORUY J4 YOU +22 269
#note Q says I had the right idea with the wrong execution - I should have played the R for 4 more points, and a look at the pool (RRRR unseen)  suggests that Q is right.  This is runner up to YOUR and nothing else is within 3 points of this.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DGILL F1 GILL.D +14 243
>Jim_Burlant: IINOORU 4H ...OU +20 289
#note And after nearly 3 minutes, I find the play.  Since I couldn't do anything with that juicy opening Sam had just given me, I expected Sam to take out row 1 and I was going to need somewhere else to score.  Quackle agrees - this is best, nothing else is worth considering.  I'm still winning 68%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: R 7H ..R +10 253
>Jim_Burlant: EFIINOR 1A FIRIN. +33 322
#note Too much of an autopilot play.  While this costs me only 3 points on the scoreboard, Q docks me nine (??) points for this mistake.  FOREIGN scores 36 and leaves an I instead of OE.  Given the 4 unseen E's I suppose this makes sense, though I think 9 points is a bit harsh.  Regardless, I'm still winning 86%.  But not for long.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EINNRST L3 R.NNIEST +59 312
#note The only playable bingo for Sam, and it brings him back up to 28% winning chances.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGKOV K10 AVO +14 336
#note And the unseen pool forces me into a terrible play.    The AEENORRTT? unseen rendered me completely paranoid that Sam had drawn a blank bingo out of the bag, and the last thing I wanted to do was float an E.  The threat of a power 5 at 8K didn't even register with me at the time.  If it had, I probably would have put down EAVE. Complicating this, any setup I could conjure up (e.g.:  K10 EVOKE, 3K GREE or 3K GREEK) was a non-starter because the unseen pool suggested I'd play for 20 and give back 35 or more if he'd landed the J or Z.   I put this down to add a handful of points and force Sam to open.  I think Quackle is right here:  seeing that I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't, just take the 36 and cross my fingers he can't bingo on this very turn.  KEEVE should have been my play;  I didn't see it.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEHNRZ L12 HERN +26 338
#note  I don't know Sam's 7th tile, but he told me enough of his rack fragment after the game to know that this is where he lost the game.   Just like I was, the unseen pool was so frightening to Sam that he blundered as badly, if not worse, than I just did. Rather than play HEEZE for 51, this was his choice so as to prevent an out bingo by me.  This decided the game.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEGKT 8K G.EK +9 345
#note Well drawn, Jim!  And expertly played, too.  This setup - not even one of Quackle's original choices - is my best possible play.  With the dynamite leave of AET? I now have outs all over the board, and Sam's best play will still leave him Z-stuck.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGJORTZ N6 JO.ER +34 372
>Jim_Burlant: ?AET 15K A.TEs +12 357
#note Was 99.5% sure ATES was good; was 100% sure this was good and I didn't want to take any chances with the win.  This costs me 8 points of spread, but whatever.
