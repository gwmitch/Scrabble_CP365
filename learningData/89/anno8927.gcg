#note Yikes, pretty poor. I didn't know LAIGH, but I did know HALID. The ridiculously lucky draws covered up some mistakes in this game.
>Jesse_Matthews: AINPV E3 PAVIN. +24 24
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHRSTW F2 HAW +26 38
#note I seriously wanted to play THAWERS but it sounded too stupid to actually work. Nevermind not even seeing WREATHS at all.

>Matthew_Larocque: CEKRSTU I2 TUCKERS +72 110
#note Holy now there's a cool 9 letter word. Like I'd entertain finding a 9 with this lol.

#note There's 2 bingos that score a smidge higher than this - I know both of them too. This does sim 2nd though. I originally saw ONETIMES but deduced that it was most likely invalid and was only an adjective.

>Matthew_Larocque: AAFINQX 7A FAX +42 248
#note Naturally I wanted to keep QI together, but this gave him a boatload of points back - NIX would have lessened the blow somewhat. Still, this does win the sim  by a decent margin.

#note Sim actually doesn't like this at all. (S)ALINA (didn't know) is competing with (MA)NIA (should have saw) for best play here.

#note Ouch. Even though I didn't know this, I didn't have to fret too hard because one of the luckiest draws imaginable bails me out. There's no getting around it here, Jesse got gipped hardcore.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGNRST 13D GRAN.TES +61 407
#note GANTR(I)ES 72, T(A)NAGERS 88. I didn't care about getting fancy, I just wanted to get the win. Spread ended up being a non-factor since Dielle's blew mine out of the water.
