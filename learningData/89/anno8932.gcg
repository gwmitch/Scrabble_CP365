>Eric_Tran: ADEHINP 8D HEADPIN +84 84
#note I should be ashamed for even holding this, I bowled for like 5 years.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIIJNO F6 JI.O +27 27
#note (H)IJAB
>Eric_Tran: AEIKLPS J2 SKIPLA.E +68 152
#note Who needs blanks right? This was announced as 71. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ABILNSU 5J .UB +14 41
#note Seemed like a fish that would probably work out, what is a NUBIA.
>Eric_Tran: ?DILNNT I7 L.D +15 167
#note Didn't see NINT(H).  KIND and LINT also sim better.  I didn't mind my leave, but would suck with a 2C draw, which I should consider more seriously.
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNOSS 10I OS +26 67
#note I wasn't expecting to grab another S of all things... Quackle says this is my best shot, but any type of legendary comeback was given the axe....
>Eric_Tran: ?AAINNT 3C ANtITAN. +76 243
#note Hey he used a blank for this one! Anyways this seemed pretty logical no reason to challenge.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFILNRS 4A FILA +28 95
#note Still no luck with the SLAIN leave, and I'm really just trying to avoid complete merciless destruction now. He wasn't 100% on FILA but with his sick letters it doesn't even matter.
>Eric_Tran: BCGORXY H10 CYBORG +56 299
#note Sim likes BRAXY.  I still likes CYBORG; good chance the 2F spot stays open.
>Matthew_Larocque: EMNRRST H1 TR.M +27 122
#note Good score good leave. M(I)R eliminates the easiest X bomb, but it's not the only place he can use it, so is it worth it? I kind of jumped on the TWS without considering any of this. RE(A)M is probably better because a lot of Es remain.
>Eric_Tran: DGGIOVX 12H .OVID +22 321
#note Missing DOGG(Y), but this creates another line for the X.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFNRSV A4 .EVER +33 155
#note A word I probably won't forget - ENFEVERS! Might as well just play FEVER 13K and turn this game into a minefield.
>Eric_Tran: ?FGGIMX 11K MIGG +27 348
#note Strange that I haven't seen this spelling, but I can't imagine he would intentionally play a phony 4. Gives me something nice for my S if I can muster a bingo sometime soon!
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNOSU L3 NU. +10 165
#note UNREASON? To disrupt the sanity of? Seriously? Stupid words are stupid >_<  My fish simulates like PIABOFOOMP, the best bet if you don't know stupid words is ANON 4L. I would prefer to keep the S-hook wide open for a word ending in S though.
>Eric_Tran: ?EFHIWX 13B WHItEF.X +137 485
#note LOLz.  He held for a long time.  I got so greedy.
>Eric_Tran: ?EFHIWX --  -137 348
#note What in the crap....Eric Tran trying to turn this into a whale of a thrashing, something for the record books. I think about this forever but decide that I couldn't live with myself if this 137 point word was shenanigans.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENORST O7 TREASON +83 248
#note I could play ATONERS but TREASON sets up another massive scoring opportunity - when the game is this out of hand you might as well have fun.
>Eric_Tran: ?EFHIWX 2E EX +51 399
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILRT N3 ATELIER +65 313
#note Was close to missing the placement here, that was worrisome. Hey I'm down by less than 100!
>Eric_Tran: ?DFHISW 13F DH.W +28 427
#note I'm short enough to be a dwarf! WHIDS beats the bingo out in the sim but just barely.
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEOTTZ O1 ZEE +38 351
#note COZE(Y), and for some reason E(R)ECT. Fishing for AZOTE, that's just crazy enough to work!
>Eric_Tran: ?FIQSUY 14J QUIfFS +82 509
#note And it might have hindered this atomic Q bomb. This is just a laugher now. A real knee slapper! 
>Matthew_Larocque: AACOOTT 11D COOT. +20 371
#note But not before I get in the last laugh with this fabrication, which sims worse than the valid play of (T)ACO G3 and OA(R) 14F.
>Eric_Tran: ENORUWY 1A YOURN +29 538
#note He guessed that I didn't know A(C)ETA - and know it I did not.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAET 14E TEA. +16 387
#note Sadly A(C)ETA makes nearly a 30-point difference in spread! That sucks. But not going out makes for a higher combined game score... woo
>Eric_Tran: EW 5D WE +16 554
>Eric_Tran:  (A) +2 556
