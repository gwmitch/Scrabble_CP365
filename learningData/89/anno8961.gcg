>Andrew_Friedman: HITW 8F WHIT +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AAIMOOT 9E MOA +17 17
#note Not great. Sim recommends TOOM 9D, which is a good way to score without opening a big comeback from the TWS.
>Andrew_Friedman: KOP 10F KOP +45 65
>Evans_Clinchy: AAIIOST H10 .ATIOS +27 44
#note Quackle: "Dude, you should totally play PATIO for 8! It sets up your S! How cool is that?" Me: "Shut up, Quackle."
>Andrew_Friedman: AGNTTV 13D VATT.NG +13 78
>Evans_Clinchy: AADIILT D12 A.ID +20 64
>Andrew_Friedman: ADELP 15A PAD.LE +30 108
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIILOT 14J OI +9 73
#note It makes more sense to play OI at 7H than 14J -- only one point less and much better defense. Surprisingly, the sim likes IOLITE J3 better than either one. I guess it's OK to blow up the rack for 19 when the bag is full of goodies. AEILT is risky anyway.
>Andrew_Friedman: EEFILNS J2 FELINES +81 189
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEILNT 5E ANTIL.fE +78 151
#note Lots of bingos in the 78-79 range; I chose this one because all six R's are unseen and he might not know/see the hook. Quackle suggests the totally sick GENITAL K1 with six overlaps. Quackle has good board vision.
>Andrew_Friedman: AX 4G AX +36 225
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADEFGV 4L FAVE +32 183
#note Sim likes FADGE 15K a little better. Considered that, but I wanted to play more open considering the deficit and the blank in hand.
>Andrew_Friedman: NRTY O4 .NTRY +24 249
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BDGRUU N8 BUG +17 200
#note Fine statically, but GUARD M2 sims best. The score is great, and BU? is a relatively good leave when there's an open line N for a bingo starting with B. Good idea, wish I'd thought of it.
>Andrew_Friedman: EOS 6F OES +22 271
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DMQRRU B13 QU. +24 224
#note Sim suggests holding onto the QU combo with MAR M3. I figured my chances to bingo were dying fast, and QUA keeping DMRR? gave me a better shot. A few extra points can't hurt, either.
>Andrew_Friedman: BE I3 BE. +26 297
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DIMORR 3A ReMORID +79 303
>Andrew_Friedman: EEEL N2 LE.EE +26 323
>Evans_Clinchy: CCEIRRU A1 CI.CE +36 339
#note Wow, this sucks. I blew the game by missing MERCURIC... and on top of that, my play is phony. Spelled it wrong. It's CERCI.
>Andrew_Friedman: HO 2E OH +28 351
>Evans_Clinchy: JNRRRUU 8L RU.. +10 349
#note I have no clue. You tell me.
>Andrew_Friedman: AGY 1F GAY +28 379

>Andrew_Friedman: DEINSW 15K SWINE +38 417
>Evans_Clinchy: JRRU 10L JU. +11 412
#note Somehow missed JUN N13, not that it matters at this point.
>Andrew_Friedman: D B2 D. +10 427
