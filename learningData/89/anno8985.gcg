>Koenski: EEEEIOY -EEIOY +0 0
#note I intended to keep one E here, threw my tiles down quickly, pressed the clock, and realized I had kept EE.  Oh well, it didn't turn out too badly.

>Koenski: AADEMRU 3F MARAU..D +28 120
#note I thought it was kind of odd that I was prevented from playing both of the bingoes ALARUMED through the L and MARAUDED through the D because one of the tiles I needed to play was already there.

>Koenski: CEEIIOP 2B PIECE +28 148
#note PERITI is a really nice play.  I wish I had found it.

>Koenski: GIILOOO J10 IGLOO +14 162
#note Static kibitzer likes GOOGOL.  Sheesh, I think I'll stick with this one.

#note It was a tough call between this and YAY.  However, setting up the bingo lane on the B column and the juicy spot for YE at 14F make me prefer this.

#note Jason was running short on time and feeling the pressure.  He missed a couple bingos here and didn't even see my AMBOINAS bingo, as he revealed in our postgame discussion, but he still found a play that wins.
