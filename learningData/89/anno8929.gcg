>Matthew_Larocque: ACDGILO H8 LOGIC +22 22
#note Brain fart. Wait, you mean this actually wins the sim? Nothing like randomly making plays that Quackle agrees with.
>Dielle_Saldanha: CELZ 9F CL.ZE +27 27
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADOTT 10H .AD +27 49
#note TOsTADA, kind of tricky I guess... for my feeble mind!
>Dielle_Saldanha: EENNRTU J2 UNENTER.. +64 91
#note First bingo played on me is a 9... sets the tone for the type of tournament I got myself into!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAOTTX 11E TAX. +22 71
#note Well I thought about this one long and hard. Should I know TAXATION? Is that a common word cause I never heard of it. Missed the nice TAXA for 39 at K2. The X can be nice but I had to dump it and get a bingo ASAP.
>Dielle_Saldanha: HIORU 12A HOURI +26 117
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEOOTV A12 .OVE +30 101
>Dielle_Saldanha: AGKU 7E KAGU +20 137
#note LOL. The first phony that I left on the board. In a different situation I might have taken a walk to the word judge, but I didn't want to risk mucking up my bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANORTV 4E OVeRN.AT +72 173
#note Sim prefers playing this for 74 and opening the 3x3. I can be reckless at times, but against elite players I think that's just a tiny bit overzealous.
>Dielle_Saldanha: AF 6F FA +29 166
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEESWY H1 WEA.Y +33 206
#note Pretty tight results though this play wins out with around 70.5% rate of victory. Other plays include WEE(N)Y 3G, DEWY, YEW or WEEDY hooking the O, and (R)EWEDS 42.
>Dielle_Saldanha: IO 5H .O.I +20 186
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELMPS 14A .AMPED +36 242
#note Bad, (R)AMPED for 42 at least forces her to make an 8. I didn't look at that R at all this game!
>Dielle_Saldanha: BEGIO 8J .OBIGE +36 222
#note Ok she really outdid herself on this one. Nothing even comes close to resembling this in the TWL. I feel so abused :( Nah I was sort of in the mindset of "Is it crucial that I challenge this?". I saw the chance to play off my J while forming a good Q hotspot and decided I might be able to make the most of those power tiles that way.
>Matthew_Larocque: DHIJLQS N6 JI. +27 269
>Dielle_Saldanha: ?EEEIRT 15D EREmITE +81 303
#note Expected, and deserved.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADHLQST 14J HALTS +45 314
#note Held off on the Q because this spot was far too easy to use. She could potentially spoil my Q spot, but in scrabble you can't always have your cake and eat it too!
>Dielle_Saldanha: DNS K7 N.DS +31 334
#note Yes, I had no clue what CLOZE meant, so the hook stands.
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIMQSY 7M Q. +42 356
>Dielle_Saldanha: BORW 5B BROW +28 362
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIMOSY 6A OY +28 384
#note Burned my clock right down here. Was oblivious to the C in *ULOGIC. DO(R)MY and MYOID I failed to find. I'm going to assume there's at least a handful of potential eights ending in the E here? But I totally failed to see that she could also makes eights with the C, and considering that, I was extraordinarily lucky.
>Dielle_Saldanha: PT A6 .PT +15 377
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFIIMS 3B DIFS +22 406
#note According to Zyzzyva, there's 3 potential combos that could form an eight to the E, but nothing with the C. Once again pure dumb luck.
>Dielle_Saldanha: EILNRSU I9 ..S +24 401
#note She saw (C)INEMA but must have not seen my other outplay - playing long with (C)RUISE or (C)URIES takes out both.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMN M10 INMA.E +16 422
>Matthew_Larocque:  (EILNRU) +12 434
#note The flukiness of this first round became prevalent for most of the tournament - I should develop a more reliable way of winning!
