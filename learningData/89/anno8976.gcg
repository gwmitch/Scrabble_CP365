#note talked myself out of EXIST and played SHEW.. i liked the ITX leave with a few different good X spots on the board and i didn't like leaving myself with HW with EXIST (even though that's probably a good leave) and still being down 40.  i dunno.  i think i would have played WISH N12 had i seen it.  EXIST - 13%, XIS N12 - 11%, WISH - 10%, SHEW - 8%.
