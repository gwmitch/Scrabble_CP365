>Matthew_Larocque: EFNOPRY 8D PORNY +26 26
#note I actually took this over FOYER or FERNY, thinking keeping the E might make it ok. *checks sim* nope should have just taken the points.
>Huguette_Settle: AJNT H4 JANT. +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFGKMW 5E WEK. +22 48
#note Pretty yucky. Well sim says it's decent, but it really isn't because she just destroys this hotspot. KE(R)F or FEW 9C are tops but man all these plays look gross.
>Huguette_Settle: EVX 6D VEX +59 82
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGMNOW 4H .OWEN +30 78
#note Awful phony that she ultimately accepts because she has 40 points ready to go.
>Huguette_Settle: ASZ 4D ZAS +40 122
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGMOOY 5K FOY +30 108
#note Abysmal. Why can't I see OFAY or FOGY. FOAM is a clever risk.
>Huguette_Settle: CE F8 .EC +11 133
>Matthew_Larocque: AGGMOSU 9C GAM. +17 125
#note Man I spent the equivalent of forever trying to decide what play was the least horrible. This play sims 2nd for reasons inexplicable to me. MOG 6L is the clear choice according to Quackle. It creates dual S-hooks but GUAS is not going to strike bingo gold here.
>Huguette_Settle: IL 6H .IL +5 138
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGOSTU C9 .OUGE +14 139
#note Quackle agrees because there's almost nothing else unless I want to fish with (Y)OU. (G)AUGE if you are paranoid about double As.
>Huguette_Settle: ?DEIMRT 13B R.MItTED +63 201
#note Well she missed a slew of higher scoring words, giving me a window to strike back!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELSTU 11F SALUTED +72 211
#note I didn't even know this word's anagram, and this word comes up often enough that I should remember it cold!
>Huguette_Settle: EORT 12I ROTE +22 223
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEIOR 3K DOE +18 229
#note E(G)O and A(G)O are both too foolish even for me. Wait until I actually get an S or a blank before I play not-so-subtle set-ups. DOE leaves me too vowel heavy though. (G)OA looks good to me.
>Huguette_Settle: CU H13 .CU +15 238
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIIRS 7J AI +4 233
#note Well then. What is this a fishing competition? But I don't have much else to do here. Gotta hope I grab some consonants and beat her to the punch.
>Huguette_Settle: OT D11 TO. +18 256
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILRSU 7G U. +6 239
#note Quackle gives me 41% chance to secure a win. 
>Huguette_Settle: ABEG B11 BA.GE +25 281
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHILRS N5 SHALIER +80 319
#note Quackle upgrades me to 66% after a succesful fish.
>Huguette_Settle: ADIIL A8 ILIAD +38 319
#note She ties the game with a cool fit....
>Matthew_Larocque: ENOPQTV 8L VO.T +33 352
#note And I run into a potential death combo here. I absolutely MUST get this Q off my rack. so the question is - will she leave the U open in fear of drawing the Q herself? I think the right move is to leave both the U and the I open for myself so I don't have to take that risk. Clearly I missed V(E)EP for 36.
>Huguette_Settle: FIN 15A N.IF +33 352
#note But I avoid an awful finish by not getting Q-stuck this time.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNPQR 15G Q.ERN +14 366
>Huguette_Settle: ?ABHIRS 13K HeRBS +27 379
#note There's a weird ass bingo - but she just needed to slap down ReHABS to clinch the game.
>Matthew_Larocque: INP 2M PIN +14 380
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AI) +4 384
#note Another close one, and no math errors surprisingly. Another "should have lost" type game though.
