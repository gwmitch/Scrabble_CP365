#note Ken exchanges the Q here.
>Reid: ADGIPUV D3 VUG +17 33
#note VAPID  or PAVID at D1 are #1 (48.60%) and #3 (47.13%). AVID at D2 is #2 (47.74%). My play is #4 (46.04%). I agree with Quackle here, this is a small mistake though.

#note #1 play.
>Ken_Kasney: EJO J1 JOE +20 118
>Reid: EENRTTY 1J .ETTER +42 211
#note I unintentionally played a phoney here. YETT, YENTE, or TENTY at K2 are top 3 (83.2%, 83.10%, 83.06%). My play is easily #1 based on valuations.
>Ken_Kasney: AAACMOO -AAACM +0 118
#note Ken again exchanges the Q.
>Reid: CFNOTWY C9 F.OWY +36 247
>Reid: CFNOTWY --  -36 211
#note FLOWN is #1 (95.93%). OFT at J5 is #2 (95.50%), COWY at K3 is #3 (24.5%). I play an unintentional phoney again and pay the price this time. I saw #1 but wanted to play my Y as well. This is a huge mistake that prevented this game from potentially being a blowout. 
>Ken_Kasney: DENP K3 PEND +19 137
>Reid: CFNOTWY C9 C.OWN +26 237
#note FLOWN is still #1 (93.13%). HOWF at 12A is #2 (92.61%). TOWNY at 9I is #3 (92.34%). My play is #4 (92.23%). This is a minor mistake at most. 
>Ken_Kasney: DO L3 OD +18 155
>Reid: AEFOQTY D12 OATY +34 271
#note #1 play. I was hoping this would plug up the board a little bit.
>Ken_Kasney: CELO 3A CLO.E +20 175

#note #1 play.
>Ken_Kasney: AGIS 15D .AGIS +27 202
>Reid: EEMQTWY G14 Q. +11 318
#note WET and WE at B6 are #1 and #2 (99.61%, 99.42%). EWE at B5 is #3 (99.41%). I was strictly focused on getting the Q out of my rack. I saw the B6 play afterwards, but I'm still okay with my play here. I disagree with Quackle. My play is not in top 15 of 5 min champ. My plays is #19 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Ken_Kasney: IUZ 14G .UIZ +44 246
>Reid: EEFMTWY B6 WE +31 349
#note DEWY at 6K is #1 (94.17%). WET is #3 (93.33%). My play is #2 (93.97%). At first I didn't agree with Quackle here, but I think Quackle is blocking up the board. I still like the points here. The win percentage is so small that I don't consider this a mistake. 
>Ken_Kasney: ?AEIIRS L6 AIRIESt +67 313
#note RIVIERAS, RARITIES, and RARIFIES at O1 are top 3. 
>Reid: EFHMNTY M3 THEM +45 394
#note The top 3 plays are guaranteed winners. HYMENS at 11G is #1 based on valuations. MYTHS at 11H is #2. IF at 9L is #3. My play is #8 (97.22%). Not sure if I agree with Quackle here, it seems counterintuitive, but it likely is because turnover makes it more likely to go out first. 
>Ken_Kasney: AIKMNOR 8L .INK +24 337
#note OKRA at K8 is #1. KRAI at K9 is #2. Ken's play is #3. 
>Reid: FNOTY B2 F.Y +23 417
#note FOYS at 11I is #1. YO at K10 is #3. My play is #2. All plays are based on valuations. 
>Ken_Kasney: AMOR M10 ROAM +17 354
#note ROAM at K10 is 2 more points. Ken's play is #2. 
>Ken_Kasney:  (NOT) +6 360
#note This game was incorrectly officially recorded as 413-360. I didn't miss any bingos. 9 or 10 (if you count the successful phony) of my 13 plays are in the top 4. 10 or 11 are in top 8. I did play two phoneys and one of them was successfully challenged. overall I give myself a C/C+ this game. Without the phoneys, this might have been a B+/A- game.
