#note YOWE seemed weaker since it opened up strong counterplays and kept a pretty impotent AOTT leave, but it is 5 points more than TOYO. Quackle likes it best.

#note I wanted to pry open more lines to bingo, so this seemed reasonable to me. Quackle says just OBIA is better, which makes sense.
>Mina_Le: CEIT L1 CITE +28 166
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEHJLN E5 HAJ. +28 170
#note Obviously HAJ in line K is good for 3 more points, but I wanted to leave that line open for a bingo. Fine with this choice.

#note The big question here is whether to fish for a bingo or focus on outscoring. I chose the latter - the pool is consonant-heavy and the board isn't great for bingos, and I'm down 27. That's close enough that I can outrun with straightforward equity plays. Quackle slightly prefers WILL 10H, which keeps ANRU? and leaves 3 in the bag, potentially meaning two chances to bingo. I thought that was too risky - this approach made more sense. Take the points.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?ABLMRU N10 BReAM +36 362
#note Is LUMBARS good? LUMBAR puncture, LUMBAR support - maybe it's an adjective with no S. Is LABRUMS good? Isn't it LABRA? I dunno, they both seemed plausible, but I wasn't positive, and there was no reason to risk it. BREAM is absolutely not the best play, but it wins comfortably.
