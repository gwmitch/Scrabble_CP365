#note she held for a bit on this play. woo fun words! JACULATE just means to throw spears.
>Leesa_Berahovich: ADLO 4J LOAD +22 91
#note interesting, her play indicates that she was hesitant to put a D on the end

>JD: EELRRRY M8 .ERL +7 259
#note again, I'm not going to open for her for no reason. she can still bingo to the R or L, but at least I take out he most immediate threats.
>Leesa_Berahovich: ?AEIINT 11F INErTIA. +64 200
#note she had GENITALIA for 2 extra points!! It's probably not even a better play though : (

#note I can block rows 13 to 15 this turn, but I really didn't like the chance of her playing OX/XI to open a new bingo line in the process. If she bingos on rows 13 or 14 she may give me a better Z play anyway. I chose PUREE to save IZAR for next turn but it doesn't really matter that much - keeping the E is probably more important.

#note she realized after that she should've played the G in space on row 12, since she had -IN already.
>JD: ABEIRSX 15A RAXES +47 425
#note I have to sacrifice a lot of points to block the G on row 1, so I figured my best bet was to empty the bag now and hope that she wouldn't have the bingo yet (there are only two vowels left). Her bingo chance without inferences is only 6% but if I infer INST it's about 25%, and about 45% inferring AINS. In reality I believe she drew the A after making her play. the swing of her having the bingo is so huge (probably -70 spread even with RAXES) that I should think about blocking with BERG at 1E to set up my X. at least my play is still a sure win.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AILNRTT 1A RATTLIN. +80 347
#note I was already pretty far down on spread, so I don't mind having opportunistically attempted to gain some more, although in this case it backfired.
