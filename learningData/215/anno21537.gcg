#note chivvy gets me closer to the kind of board I want against conrad than playing viny

#note I love this shot at this point - my RSTT leave can fill in nicely for a 90-point bingo at O8, and conrad may not get to block at all.

#note I missed the chance to play TSK here for 48. However, playing it is a tough call because conrad will be up 63 on a rather dead board if I play it, whereas my play lets me generate a lot of volatility.

#note still fighting the good fight, I liked that this opened up a new bingo lane on row 1 (AGIN) that he can't really do much about.
