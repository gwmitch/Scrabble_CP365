#note I saw the spot at row 7, but row 14 seemed like much better defense.

>JD: ?EKMNTW H12 ME.K +39 268
#note at the time I was somewhat concerned about setting up the SMERK hook, but there are so many other things going on on the board that I think keeping a stronger leave outweighs the benefits of playing KERN.
>Chris_Cree: DEEJ 13G J.ED +44 198
>JD: ?ANOOTW 14M AW +22 290
#note too defensive? I saw WOOED at L1 but then decided I was better off blocking the obvious set of lanes on columns M-O. In retrospect I much prefer WOOED - I keep a much more powerful leave (bingoing is the surest way to make sure he doesn't catch up), and he's probably just as likely to bingo with SMERK as anywhere else. AW does not decrease his bingo percent by that much, and also just gives him back free points.

#note would nigel have seen ANIM(AL)I(E)RS?
>JD: ?AINOOS 10N OI +8 318
#note I'm still in good shape with the blank, but I have to be careful. first priority seemed to be blocking the huge X spot at 10N, although several good ones remain on the board.
>Chris_Cree: BHSU 6B HUBS +32 329
>JD: ?AAFNOS 10I OAF +18 336
#note I wanted to block the other cheap X spot on the board at 9I, and save a leave that would allow me to get a big score by playing CHUBS next turn. keeping the N seemed like it would lower my variance compared to playing FANO, but I guess it also gives me an extra shot at drawing the X, so probably FANO is the play.
>Chris_Cree: AEN N1 ANE +21 350
>JD: ?AAHNRS O3 SHARNy +40 376
#note I saw ANARCHS in both spots but chickened out of it - after all, how can an anarchy have a ruler?? Instead, I looked at what would happen after SHARNY and saw that I had outs with any tile draw - however, I forgot to check the U, which leads to a draw after I play UREA! so I gave up .5/8 of a win, or 6%. spread was kind of important, too, so playing ANARCHS would've really helped.
>Chris_Cree: EGILPUX B12 L.XU +44 394
#note of course, in this case I was so happy to know that I had an out after drawing the O that I failed to pay attention to what he put on the board!! he had gotten low on time also.
>JD: AO B6 .AO +6 382
#note for a moment I thought that I had done the math wrong and that it was a tie, but fortunately I held on for the 2 point win.
