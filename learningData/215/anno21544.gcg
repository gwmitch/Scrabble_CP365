>JD: EEHLOQV 8D HELVE +30 30
#note QO is substantially worse than EQ, I thought the defensive gains by playing HELVE made it worthwhile but actually HELVE and HOVEL are even on defense. definite error.

#note jeez, two consecutive major errors. HADJI an obvious improvement.
>Darrell_Day: FISU M2 .UIFS +20 95
>JD: AABFJST 7C JAB +31 196
#note CUIFS definitely suggests another S, but I didn't particularly like FAJITA placing the A in the triple word column. however, quackle loves my bingo chances after FAJITA with my leave of BS, saying that my bingo rate jumps from 13% to 23% compared to playing JAB. I am a bit surprised by this result. at least this was a less egregious error than the two prior ones.

#note darrell: why u no play exciton jesse??
>JD: CEHIINT M10 ITCH +20 336
#note jeez, I had an unusual determination this game to play like shit. why not just take the points for HIC? ITCH does block a few extra bingos, but not many (28% down to 24%)

>JD: EEIMNNP N6 PINENE +34 370
#note hey look, it's a play that doesn't immediately suck
>Darrell_Day: ??ALRST O7 TARSaLs +84 282
#note STARTLE for 3 extra
>JD: AELMMOO 11C LOOM +30 400
#note just playing OM at this spot avoids giving such a strong comeback on row 12.
>Darrell_Day: AEORRTV C1 ..OR +10 292
#note best is TROVER/TORT at H10.
>JD: AEGMT K6 GAME +25 425
#note also blocking his best out
>Darrell_Day: AERTV H10 AVERT +13 305
#note wow, that was an extremely poor game on my part - by all rights I probably should've put up a 500. instead my spread remained weak.
