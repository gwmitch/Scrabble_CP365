>Charles_Reinke: DFGNOOO H8 GONOF +26 26
>Jerry_Lerman: EIINPR G9 PINIER +28 28
>Charles_Reinke: ?DEEJOW F10 JO +54 80
#note ...JO(IN)tWEED...this might be better still since it sets up my D.
>Jerry_Lerman: IQTU 13C QUIT. +28 56
>Charles_Reinke: ?DEEEMW E8 WED +19 99
#note This play screws up my bingo chances because I'm not always going to draw one that end in an E. I almost did MEWED but though it gave up too many easy scores on an unfriendly board.
>Jerry_Lerman: HRT D12 R.TH +22 78
>Charles_Reinke: ?EEFMTX 9G ..X +20 119
#note If I'm committed to playing the X this turn I should do H14 EX. This sucks as a fish.
>Jerry_Lerman: ABL 15A BLA. +27 105
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEEFMT F2 FErMATE +76 195
>Jerry_Lerman: ENTZ 4D NE.TZ +46 151
>Charles_Reinke: AEIIKOP H1 PIE.O +48 243
#note EPI(Z)OA.
>Jerry_Lerman: AGM 3C GAM. +20 171
>Charles_Reinke: ADDIKTU 7A DIKTA. +24 267
#note Clears up my rack and scores. Jerry's play up to this point doesn't scream "FISHING" but he'll often have a good play in this new spot.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADO 8A ODA +30 201
>Charles_Reinke: ADEENUW I5 WUD +14 281
#note Negating the usefulness of POX(Y) with two Y's unseen. E2 E(ME)U is nice, as is 5F (M)E(O)WED. Quackle doesn't like my play at all.
>Jerry_Lerman: CLOT J3 COLT +18 219
>Charles_Reinke: AAEEINO 3J .IAO +12 293
>Jerry_Lerman: U C13 .U. +14 233
>Charles_Reinke: AEEENRY K5 YE +33 326
#note This doesn't give back bingos as easily as something like YEA or YEAN.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?ILRSSU M2 S.ILUReS +59 292
#note Jerry has SqUIRLS+ here. 
>Charles_Reinke: AEEEINR L7 ERE +10 336
#note Trying to make it hard for Jerry to score. Blocking the DLS-TWS combo on row eight is a big priority. Hard to say what's right here since I have no way to score myself at this point. Quackle likes L8 AERIE by a significant margin.
>Jerry_Lerman: AY 6A AY +32 324
>Charles_Reinke: AEILNNR 12A NEA. +18 354
#note Was running out of time here. It is not a good idea for me to play off so many vowels even if I do score well. Quackle wants me to fish off the N. 
>Jerry_Lerman: G L3 .G +12 336
>Charles_Reinke: BHILNOR K9 HOB +22 376
#note Jerry's last play was a definite fish. Have to block.
>Jerry_Lerman: V 8L ..V +5 341
>Charles_Reinke: CILNRRV B10 VI. +14 390
#note I didn't have nearly enough time to figure out the endgame properly. All I knew is that I had to get rid of the V and C in my two remaining turns. I have F2 (F)L(I)C or 6E C(A)R after this.
>Jerry_Lerman: AEEINSS O8 SANIES +39 380
#note It doesn't look like Jerry has a win here, but he can get really close if he plays G6 ES and goes out with ANISE.
>Charles_Reinke: CLNRR 6E C.R +16 406
>Jerry_Lerman: E 2E E. +10 390
#note Scored as 11.
>Jerry_Lerman:  (LNR) +6 396
#note Final: 397-406.
