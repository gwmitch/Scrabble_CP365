>Paul_Erland: AAJNW 8D JAWAN +46 46
>Reid: HORTTUV 7G HUT +22 22
#note HUT at 9G is #1 (30.84%). VAT and VATU at G7 are #2 (29.16%) and #3 (29.06%). My play is #4 (28.87%). Right word, wrong place. This is a small mistake at most. 
>Paul_Erland: ELNPTTX -ELNPT +0 46
>Reid: EIKORTV D8 .OKIER +34 56
#note OIK at 9G is #1 (44.25%). KIVA at E5 is #2 (43.08%). JOKER is #3 (42.91%). I considered JOKER but didn't want to give an ess hook. I like KIVA a lot, it's more my style. My play is #4 (42.56%). This is a small mistake. 
>Paul_Erland: ANNP 11C P.NNA +14 60
>Reid: CEIITTV E5 VIT. +14 70
#note I saw #1 EVICT at H11 (61.55%) but couldn't remember if PINNAE was valid. VITRIC at 13A is #2 (51.44%). TRIVET at 13C is #3 (49.79%). My play is #10 (48.24%). This is a big mistake. 
>Paul_Erland: HIP 9G HIP +31 91
>Reid: ?CEIITU 6I UvEITIC +62 132
#note I was proud of this turn until reviewing it just now. CRITIQUE at 13C is #1 (67.35%). DIURETIC, NEURITIC at 13A are #2 and #3 (65.86%, 64.23%). My play is #6 (61.73%). This is a medium sized mistake. 
>Paul_Erland: ENT O6 .ENT +18 109
>Reid: ?AAGLNR K5 G.RANiAL +82 214
#note #1 play here. Loads of bingos available.
>Paul_Erland: BELT J10 BLET +25 134
>Reid: IIRRRYY 13B YI.R +14 228
#note #1 play.
>Paul_Erland: LOOO 5D O.OLO +8 142
>Reid: DIRRUVY 6D Y.D +23 251
#note VIRID at 6B is #1 (96.85%). RUDELY at 12G is #2 (95.62%). VIRTU at M3 is #3 (95.52%). My play is not in the top 15 of 5 min champ. My play is #22 based on valuations of all plays. I agree with Quackle here. I like VIRTU best here. This is a medium sized mistake at least. 
>Paul_Erland: CEEISSS 14H ECSESIS +81 223
#note Paul gets a very plausible phony by me. ECESIS is good, ECESISES is good, but ECSESIS is invalid.
>Reid: AILRRUV 15D VIARL +42 293
>Reid: AILRRUV --  -42 251
#note I meant to play VIRAL #1 (87.24%). LIVER at H11 is #2 (82.05%). RIVAL is #3 (81.79%). I misplaced my tiles. This was a big silly mistake that nearly cost me the game. 
>Paul_Erland: ADO H12 OD.A +18 241
#note Luckily, Paul doesn't have anything to take advantage of my mistake. 
>Reid: AILRRUV M3 VIR.UAL +24 275
#note #1 play.
>Paul_Erland: DEO 15M DOE +17 258
>Reid: DEEFORT 4B DEF +32 307
#note REEF and FORTat 4A are #1 (83.9%) and #3 (83.03%). REF at 4B is #2 (83.33%). My play is #9 (79.77%). This is a small mistake. 
>Paul_Erland: EEFX B2 FE.EX +64 322
>Reid: EEINORT A5 TONIER +29 336
#note TENOR, NOTER, and TONER are top 3 (58.27%, 58.00%, 56.40%). My play is #5 (54.58%). This is a small mistake.
>Paul_Erland: GM 3A G.M +20 342
>Reid: ABEGMRZ 4L B.Z +28 364
#note Once I knew that Paul had the Q and I saw that I had the Z, I figured the game was mine. I played #1 BIZ for the out and to distract him from it. I was hoping he would think that this was a setup and that I wasn't able to go out. I was hoping he would feel he had two turns to play the Q and that he would not play it first. 
>Paul_Erland: AOQSUW M12 QA.. +28 370
#note Paul plays his Q first although he almost didn't make the play. 
>Reid: AEGMR 4F GAMER +25 389
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (OSUW) +14 403
#note This game was officially scored incorrectly at 402-376. Paul got a phoney past me and I goofed trying to play VIRAL. 7 of my 13 plays were in the top 4. 11 of 13 plays in the top 10. This game should have been 100+ blowout in my favor but I almost lost it. I clearly outdrew Paul and he likely had some tough racks. Overall, I give myself a C-/D+. On the bright side, at least I had a good endgame.
