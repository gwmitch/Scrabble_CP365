#note since i know he has an S, 4K MAUVE becomes best.

>cesar: EEOORTZ J8 .OZ +34 76
#note this is such a bad move. sometimes i'm just simply unable to anagram and i miss the obvious OOZE at O1. a ~17 point equity mistake against Rafi should be enough to lose the game.
>rafi: AAHIRST K8 SHARIAT +96 130
#note he wouldn't have scored as much for this.
>cesar: EEEIORT N2 RE.OTE +22 98
#note and i wouldn't have to make this play. although maybe i should just play OE somewhere.
>rafi: ?ADEILO O6 IsOLEAD +80 210
#note yeah
>cesar: AAEEGIU 3I EAU +11 109
#note GATEAU is significantly better. AEGI is a weak weak leave. -9.5

>cesar: ACEGIPP 13H PIP.GE +24 133
#note maybe should just fish with M3 PUG. i need to play small to have a higher chance of winning. -0.5

#note i like playing short but HAAF at 2G gives up less apparently.. maybe quackle is worrying about the K. i don't know. -6.5

>cesar: ?AAENRY N10 YA +28 304
#note suddenly my chances improve by a bit. quackle is smarter than me. i have to turn over three tiles here, so he can bingo and i can triple-triple out. quackle likes 11E YANG, leaving 9A as the most likely starting spot for him.. especially after his exchange 2. N9 ANY is also better than my move. however, rafi probably won't bingo if it'll empty the bag, so i'm still not going to win :P -2%
