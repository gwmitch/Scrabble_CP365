#note MICA looks better, preventing overlaps.

#note great draw, no need to play TENDERLY
>Nigel_Peltier: EEFINST 5E INFESTE. +94 115
#note game on
>JD: ?ENOTUZ H1 bONZ. +69 155
>Nigel_Peltier: ?IINRTV 11E THANE +24 139
>JD: EJPTTUU 4C JUT +22 177
#note I gave up a lot of points to keep the E on this turn - probably too many. quackle likes being greedy and playing JUPE. also, I missed the ETHANE hook at the time - fortunately it did not become relevant.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?IINRTV 12A VITRaIN +84 223
#note now it's really on
>JD: BELLPTU B10 BU.LT +26 203
#note I didn't come up with LETUP at 10B, but BUILT is nearly as strong thanks to higher bingo percentage.
>Nigel_Peltier: AEKW A7 WEKA +37 260
>JD: AEGLPST 11K GAP +20 223
#note I can also just fish off the G at F10, but then nigel can block on row 2 and block many of my bingos.
>Nigel_Peltier: AORW C4 .OWAR +16 276
>JD: EELOSST 13G TOELESS +72 295
#note Q says take the extra points for TOELESS at N9, since I open two good scoring spots and I should be able to get the other.
>Nigel_Peltier: ADIQ 14F QAID +43 319
>JD: BDEEGLU 12L BUG +27 322
#note I'm at a disadvantage, but BUG gives me a great potential equalizer if I can draw the S
>Nigel_Peltier: AMO I2 MOA. +25 344
>JD: DEELLXY M1 YELD +19 341
#note massive costly mistake - XYLENE/JUTE scores great and gives me a nice shot of drawing the S. YELLER/ETHANE would also be a major upgrade over my choice. don't know why I didn't see these better options! the real problem with YELD is that I give back so many free points to him.
>Nigel_Peltier: HOO N1 OHO +29 373
>JD: EFGILOX 10M OX +31 372
#note should I block the S hook or not? I block my biggest source of volatility, but gain a lot of points in the process without emptying the bag. he can also simply block the S hook now by playing on column O if I do play somewhere else. finally, he is quite likely to have the S hook himself. I was quite low on time and decided to go for cutting spread as much as possible.
>Nigel_Peltier: ACEEORR 10D REC +27 400
#note fortunately for me, NIgel checked out of OCREAE at O3 which wins all of the endgames, and blocks my game-winning play...REC wins 3.5/8 on paper,  with a tie if the R is in the bag and wins if the E, F or G are left. But both of us were very low on time, so probably a lot of the actual endgames are tossups.
>JD: EFGILRU O3 GULFIER +90 462
#note amazingly, the key was not drawing the S! Given the actual pool of RSU, I also win if I draw RS by playing GRIEFS, but drawing US would've been a tie - FIE followed by SLUG to go out.
