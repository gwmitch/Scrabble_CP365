>Joel_Ekins: GIMS 8G MIGS +14 14
>Reid: EEHINNV J2 VENINE. +20 20
#note VEIN at 9E is #1 (45.74%) and more my style, but I decided to change things up and chose #2 (44.45%). I usually like to keep an E. HEN at 9F is #3 (44.33%). This is a minor mistake.
>Joel_Ekins: IRTW 9E WRIT +15 29
>Reid: AEHHOOY 8A YAHOO +41 61
#note #1 play.
>Joel_Ekins: BRW 3H BR.W +10 39
>Reid: DEFHNOO K5 FOH +35 96
#note #1 play.
>Joel_Ekins: IR H1 RI. +15 54
>Reid: AADEINO 1G O.A +3 99
#note ODA or ADO at 7A are #1 (70.86%) and #2 (70.70%). ADO at 9A is #3 (69.41%).  I considered all of these plays but didn't want to plug up the board this early. I didn't like my play here but I thought I could balance my way to a bingo. My play is not in the top 15 of 5 min champ. My play is #19 based on valuations of all pays. This is better than I had thought at the end of the game. I ended up cutting on a vital bingo lane here.
>Joel_Ekins: DIILPS 4C LIPIDS +27 81
>Reid: ADEEINN 5B NIDE +23 122
#note Well, I got my bingo rack but have no home for it. ENNEAD at 7C is #1 (67.02%). INANE at 5C is #2 (65.76%). DEAN at 7E is ## (64.30%). My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ.  NIDE at 5D is #4. My play is #11 based on valuations of all plays. This is a medium sized mistake because ENNEAD is a beautiful play that scores well and would have opened up the board later. 
>Joel_Ekins: ?EENOSS 10B OnENESS +78 159
#note Joel now has a sealed off board and he has had all the esses and the first blank. This gave him a huge advantage the rest of the way. 
>Reid: ?AADENO 9A ADO +20 142
#note DEAN ar 7E is #1 (49.01%).  ADO at 7A is #2 (48.85%). My play is #3 (48.79%). This is not really a mistake.
>Joel_Ekins: ADRT 7E DRAT +25 184
#note Nice play here. 
>Reid: ?AEIINT D10 .NTIA +10 152
#note REI at F9 is #1 (45.82%). TI at F1 is #2 (39.41%). ET at 6F is #3 (38.91%). #2 and #3 seem silly, they balance well, but there is no home for a bingo unless Joel opens, and he is not likely to do so with his current lead. #1 is Quackle realizing this. I knew I had to open. My play is #28 based on valuations of all plays. I like my play better than Quackle's REI because is opens more. REI is easy to block with a hook. 
>Joel_Ekins: AGP C13 GAP +20 204
#note Joel blocks nicely as expected.
>Reid: ?CEFLLT L4 EFT +24 176
#note #1 play.
>Joel_Ekins: OVX M2 VOX +35 239
>Reid: ?ACCLLQ F3 Q. +11 187
#note What a time to get the Q! CAP at 15A is #1 (21.34%). RECALL at F9 is #2 (18.09%). Exchanging CLQ is #3 (17.44%). While exchanging here is preferrable, I really don't have the luxury due to spread. RECALL tries to open again but has a horrible leave. My play is #6 (17.01%). This is a small mistake at most. 
>Joel_Ekins: AER 2J .AR.E +27 266
#note Joel goes for points but opens a dangerous hook. 
>Reid: ?ACCLLU 15A CU. +21 208
#note There is the U I needed last turn. My play is #1.
>Joel_Ekins: JO 1K JO +26 292
>Reid: ?ACELLY 13C ..LLY +13 221
#note HONE at C8 is #1 917.50%). CHON at C7 is #2 (15.97%). REALLY at F9 is #3 (14.03%). My play is #5 (11.33%). Quackle, like me, is counting on a hook to NOT. I like my play better because its harder to block top and bottom. 
>Joel_Ekins: GNU 6A GUN +13 305
>Reid: ?ABCELT 3A CAB +26 247
#note I saw ACTABLE #1 (30.50%) at 12G but couldn't recall if it was valid. ABET at 12F is #3 (26.75%). My play is #2 (26.75%). 
>Joel_Ekins: KMU A1 MU.K +51 356
#note Joel goes for the big points here instead of the conservative block of MU at 1N.
>Reid: ?EEEILT O2 sTEELIE +82 329
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (AEERTUZ) +32 361
#note 8 of my 13 plays were in the top 3. 10 of 13 in the top 6. I did miss a bingo and it may have been a blessing in disguise because I caught Joel with the Z. While I got a little lucky at the end, Joel was lucky to start. ORA was a poor play and hurt me later in the game. Overall, I give myself a B-/C+ this game.
