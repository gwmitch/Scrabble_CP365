#note first difficult decision of the tournament. nearly played euro. board is quite dead, so I wanted to cover the easy scoring spot on column M while keeping a decent leave.

#note this is an easy play if I think BAALS is good, but I was prepared to challenge if he hooked it. Instead, I played an inadvertent phony to set up my X! my best play otherwise is probably WIGGER, which I did not spot for some reason. not my best decision ever!

#note depending on Joel's leave, it may not make sense to sacrifice points to block, because he can just bingo from the R anyway. That said, if I don't block any lanes on this turn, he can keep opening new spots and I may lose control of the board entirely. I really like COWIER at 3G - if he bingos I can score, and he probably can't use the triple word score to score if he has bingo-prone tiles.
>Joel_Elkins: E G11 .E +2 178
>JD: DGIKNTW 2J T..NG +30 294
#note not worth it for me to sacrifice points, instead I score and set up another scoring spot - hopefully he can't bingo here.
>Joel_Elkins: AEILNST 13A TENAILS +70 248
#note huge break for me that he didn't find slainte/saltine

>JD: EEMNOOV 2D MOVE +21 394
#note any play that blocks row 2 gives me great winning chances. if he does find an improbable bingo fit elsewhere on the board, I will be able to score on row 1 and outrun.

#note correct play is NO at 14E setting up VOGIE for a lot, which prevents him from playing LADE at N4.
