>Jesse_Day: AEEKORU 8H EUREKA +30 30
>Thomas_Reinke: AAGNNOS N2 GOANNAS +81 81
#note J: new in TWL15 (EUREKAS, that is)
>Jesse_Day: ALOTVWZ O1 VOW +35 65
#note J: no hurry to play ZA.
>Thomas_Reinke: AIPRSTX 9K TIX +43 124
>Jesse_Day: Z 7M Z. +50 115
>Thomas_Reinke: AMOPRST M1 PAM +34 158
>Jesse_Day: AAHILNT 5H INHALA.T +72 187
#note J: I guess he didn't want to set up front-hooks to AMP, but he would've blocked INHALANT with AMP (I still have ANTHELIA though).
>Thomas_Reinke: EELORST 4B SOLERET +69 227
>Jesse_Day: DEEGPUY 3A GUYED +37 224
#note J: still in range
>Thomas_Reinke: ?BIMNNT K1 BINM.N +10 237
#note J: I held, knowing it was good in CSW12 but not sure if they had added it. good thing I didn't challenge.   T: He held this, if it had been more points would he have challenged? How many players know the new novel sixes anyway? I was dying to play PITHOI.
>Jesse_Day: DEEFPRS 5E FE +26 250
#note J: I didn't like the cheap points given up with FUSED at B2. FE at 5D actually sims a bit better by not setting up easy comebacks. everything sims close.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?AABGIT J1 ABA +27 264
#note 6D GIB, which I wanted to keep open.
>Jesse_Day: CDEOPRS 6F COP +29 279
#note J: I sacrificed one point (not playing COP at I1) because row 6 seemed much easier for him to score at. quackle agrees.
>Thomas_Reinke: ?DEGILT 10F DELIGhT +75 339
>Jesse_Day: DEIORRS I1 DOR +20 299
#note J: it didn't occur to me to pass up 8 points and just play OR, but DEIRS is that much of an upgrade over EIRS (especially given an ugly bag with very few bingo-prone consonants). The sim is even between DOR and OR.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIIJOR A1 JI. +33 372
>Jesse_Day: EIQRSUY 11B QUIRE +31 330
#note J: QUEY is an obvious play, but also a losing one, in my opinion - Thomas should be able to control the board and block. Fishing the Y is also unpromising, Thomas is certain to play very defensively and block most bingos on my only lane (row 11). I think my play is by far my best hope of winning.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEILORT 12A LI +14 386
#note T: Oh damn. Have to block, Quackle agrees but thinks I should play OI instead.
>Jesse_Day: ?DHIRSY 13B SYRpHID +90 420
#note J: great draw, but I really had to work after he blocked HYBRIDS. Even DISHY at 11I still would've given me great winning chances, but this puts me in control.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEOORTV -  +0 386
#note T: I challenge. I was pretty sure on it, but I couldn't see a likely way to win with my rack.
>Jesse_Day: CEFNOTU 1A .UNCO +17 437
#note J: difficult play. If he had a bingo, he would've almost certainly played it in response to SYRPHID. To prevent him from fishing effectively I wanted to leave 1 in the bag so I would be able to block as necessary, and I also definitely didn't want to give him a letter to play an 8 through. The other option is TOFU at 12G, which I saw, but I didn't like the lane I'd be opening on row 14 for bingos starting with S. At the end of the day, I think this is the correct play. 
>Thomas_Reinke: EEOORTV F13 .O +7 393
#note Fishing off the O is correct, I think this gives him the most chance to screw up, he's really low on time here.
>Jesse_Day: AEEFITW H13 .EF +21 458
#note J: tough play, I have to block OVERSET at row 12 and all of his bingos on row 15 without giving him back an 8 (DEW gives OVERWETS). Fortunately I had enough time to figure out how to do this effectively, and also saving WE for next turn for an easy score. IDEA/EDIT/ADIT all do the same but gain 1 extra point of spread.
>Thomas_Reinke: EEORSTV 15A STROVE +36 429
#note J: missed TROVES.  T: TROVES, you dummy.
>Jesse_Day: AEITW 9G WE +21 479
>Thomas_Reinke: E 4K .E +12 441
>Thomas_Reinke:  (AIT) +6 447
#note T: Jesse lost 10 on time, final score 469-447
