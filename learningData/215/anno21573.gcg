#note 9C ZIP is 32, but I'm hoping to score with the Z later.
>Ken_Kasney: AHY 7C YAH +26 48
>Charles_Reinke: AORSTUZ 6B ZA +36 60
#note There are two better places to play ZA, but this sets up another bingo lane.
>Ken_Kasney: FIRT B2 FRIT. +34 82
>Charles_Reinke: AEORSTU H2 OUTREA.S +60 120
#note Saw ORATURES+ but told myself it was only ORACIES+. I guess the new bingos still need some work.
>Ken_Kasney: CENW 4A W.NCE +28 110
>Charles_Reinke: ACDETVY C9 .EAVY +28 148
#note Didn't really like this when I played it. Remembering WINCEY would help here. At least I have vowels to play through with my CDT leave.

#note This sims best! Now you can pretend that I saw A1 JO but passed it up for advanced strategic reasons.

#note The only bingo I saw was J2 (A)NNUlATE for 57, which I thought wasn't enough. However, any bingo will effectively put me up by two bingos and ANNULATE actually does a great job of closing the board (other than the S hook on DROOL). All that is moot if I see UNEATEN on row 1.

#note L4 pROTEAN doesn't open up any triples. It also plays on the other side. I saw the word but overlaps are hard sometimes. Also, who says I need to work on the new bingos?
