#note It took me an unnecessarily long time to find the bingo in AEILNOPT and then it didn't even play. Also, this was the first game of "Reinke Scrabble", where you get one extra point for every bingo you see that doesn't play.  So I scored this as 65.

#note Just like that my chances to win this game are extremely slim.
>Charles_Reinke: DEGNOPT 3C P.ONGED +30 193
#note This seemed like the clear choice since it gives me a feasible lane for sevens, so I hardly looked for other plays. 11B G(A)PED is another choice.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EHINOR 4H HEROIN +38 307
>Charles_Reinke: AADRSTU 13L AU.D +10 203
#note Blatantly setting up another lane, but Amnuay has to work hard to block it without giving me access to the TWS.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EJO 3K JOE +35 342
>Charles_Reinke: AAIMRST 12B A.ARMIST +72 275
#note TAMARISK! That would actually get me within striking distance. I saw that I was close to ANTIMASK/KATSINAM+ but AAKIMRST didn't set off any alarms in my head.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: Q 6N Q. +31 373
>Charles_Reinke: EEERSWZ 5I EEW +44 319
#note Setting up a spot to dump the Z, this play is exactly what I need.

>Charles_Reinke: EEINRST O1 RE....... +42 393
#note This is phony. None of the two-letter front extensions for ACTIVE take an S. Just EXTRACTIVES (doesn't count) and HYPERACTIVES. This is all part of my master plan though...

>Charles_Reinke: EINST 13C STEIN +49 442
>Charles_Reinke: EINST --  -49 393
#note This would win by one given the score on my scoresheet. If we recounted it would tie. Obviously POETICALS* is totally ridiculous but so are a lot of other things. Like having to pay $3.25 for a bottle of soda at the Silver Legacy food court and then finding out that the vending machine by your room sells them for $2.00.

#note Should have seen TAMARISK.
