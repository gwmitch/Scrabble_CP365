>Nigel_Peltier: DEILP G9 PILED +29 29
>Charles_Reinke: ACEEJNT F8 TAJ +57 83
>Nigel_Peltier: IKST I7 TISK +35 64
#note TISK*. I really didn't like it, but then I told myself that it had been a while since I reviewed the new fours, and that Nigel wouldn't play a phony four. The repeating theme at the beginning of the tournament was that I assumed my opponents were more accurate in their word knowledge than they actually were.
>Charles_Reinke: CEEMNNS 8A CEMEN. +33 116
#note I took a long time to see this play. Time trouble would play a part later in the game.
>Nigel_Peltier: AAEGINT C6 AG.INATE +78 142
>Charles_Reinke: ACIINSS D2 ACINI +16 132
#note D10 ANISIC is clearly best. That's a word I don't know. I wasn't eager to telegraph an S but the S is so useless on this board that it doesn't matter. J10 SI is fine.

>Nigel_Peltier: IU 3B .U.I +18 212
>Charles_Reinke: ADORRSU B10 ORAD +24 235
#note 12F (DEF)RAUD would be nice to set up my S. After ZEPS Nigel wouldn't necessarily assume I still have one.
>Nigel_Peltier: EHY I12 YEH +21 233
>Charles_Reinke: AEGORSU 8H ..AOUR +8 243
#note AERUGOS! I made a token effort to look for bingos but AEGORSU didn't look very familiar. My play is just a desparate attempt to open up the board. Maybe with two blanks out I should stick to the "conventional" A1 AG.
>Nigel_Peltier: ALOUV M3 VALOU. +20 253
>Charles_Reinke: ??EGISS N8 SIGnEtS +78 321
#note I really wanted to double-double here, but even after draining my clock to about two minutes I couldn't find one. ARGOSIES, GENOISES, PISHOGES, ISOGONES, and ISAGOGES are my choices there.
>Nigel_Peltier: DENTUV K5 UNV.TED +44 297
#note Another phony, but this one I didn't even doubt. Confused with OUTVOTED I suppose.
>Charles_Reinke: ABEQRTW 4L Q.T +24 345
#note X-bombs at 6N are probably the only way I can lose. I should do N5 AW as I will always be able to play the Q off. I'm still in decent shape though.
>Nigel_Peltier: IX N4 .IX +53 350
>Charles_Reinke: ABEOORW O5 BOW +23 368
#note I had less than a minute to figure out any kind of endgame sequence. M12 WEAR looks like it wins since it blocks all of Nigel's high-scoring plays on the L column and leaves me O5 BOO.
>Nigel_Peltier: EHMNORY L10 HOMY +32 382
>Charles_Reinke: AEOR J13 ROE +14 382
>Nigel_Peltier: ENR E1 RE.N +8 390
>Nigel_Peltier:  (A) +2 392
#note Allowing a phony four, missing a high-probability bingo, missing multiple double-doubles while getting into time trouble, allowing a phony double-double seven, misplaying the pre-endgame, and blowing the endgame. It's been at least several weeks since I botched a game this badly.
