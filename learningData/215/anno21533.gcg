#note I feel the need to protect the S-TIFF hook .  MONTH results in a very closed board very quickly.  Maybe MHO but I'm fine with my line which also partially protects JOG-S temporarily.

#note I don't know.  All options are abysmal: OVA 6a is too easy for opponent to outrun, although better technically.  Hoped for opponent to lose mind or not have an A.

#note (Updated) OPRRUW are for certain.  I might've had an S in which case I missed POSEUR, but I highly doubt I play POW with an S, though I guess it's possible.  More likely, I had this rack, in which case I probably prefer PURIN to what I did, but didn't because I didn't want to give away the easy points.  I think this was my actual rack though, and didn't write down my racks til after the game and probably wrote an S by mistake.
