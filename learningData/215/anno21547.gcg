#note I didn't want to play AA at 7F, so I was left with AA at 7G or my play. Jason's record of games shows that he is a strong defensive player, so I felt like he would react very defensively to AA, given the chance, and might end up blocking too many of my bingos. I didn't really think about just playing AE, which actually wins the sim, bingoing 80% of the time, but I think that number is an exaggeration - jason is going to react by playing on row 6 probably, again lowering my bingo percentage. I think my play is OK.

#note jason's play likely would've been MACK after AE, blocking quite a few bingos, which I think is a typical type of play in his situation. So I think WADI was justified. in this case, I drew well to complete the rack.

>JD: ABEHOOR J10 HO. +29 185
#note I did not come up with the all-star play of DHOORA at 14I, which even drops jason's bingo percentage a bunch. that would've been a handy find.

>JD: ABBEOPR M11 P.OB +20 205
#note I almost played BEBOP, which I don't like at all now. the most painful bingos at this point are probably to the D, so quackle likes playing DOBBER from the D (or DABBER), which didn't occur to me. But I think my play is decent - he probably has all one-pointers, so I get to cash in on free points if he does have the bingo.

>JD: ABEEFIR 5A FIREBA.E +76 281
#note I can't imagine that playing FIREBASE at 2A could be a good idea, but quackle seems to think so. I am satisfied with my cowardice this time.
>Jason_Li: AHIO O8 OHIA +37 192
#note now the board is realllllly open - in part because I played PROB and HOT earlier instead of coming up with either DHOORA or DOBBER.
>JD: ?EEIOTX 6E OX. +55 336
#note I'm sure he was a trifle confused about why I spent so long on this play...
>Jason_Li: ADGIILN N2 GLIADIN +78 270
>JD: ?AEEITU 2C EqUI.ETA +61 397
#note steering well clear of BEAUTIED#, thankfully
>Jason_Li: ANPW 4F P.WN +34 304
#note spectacularly, jason still hasn't drawn an E for row 15...
>JD: ADILRYZ A5 .RAZIL +54 451
#note an embarassment of riches, blocking the 3x3 line seems necessary given my big lead. the bag is fast running out of vowels, so actually playing FRIZ saving YALD for 1H sims about as well as FRAZIL.
>Jason_Li: JMO K11 M.JO +36 340
>JD: ?DETTUY 1H YET +37 488
#note I wanted to save the possibility of bingoing, but DTU? won't do it better to play TUT at 1H and save the E for row 15 next turn (and have a 10% bingo chance with DEY?), or just take the points for DUTY. meh.
>Jason_Li: CFGLNNN 4L FL.C +24 364
>JD: ?DITTUU C9 T...I +14 502
#note ran out of time as always. quackle likes DIT at 3C best because I should start by blocking NEG, otherwise he can go out in two moves.
>Jason_Li: GNNN C1 N.G +8 372
>JD: ?DTUU 1A DU. +12 514
#note best is STUD at J4 since he's supposed to go out. he was also out of time though
>Jason_Li: NN J1 ..N +3 375
#note he was trying to get me over on time.
