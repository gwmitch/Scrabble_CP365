#note Was worried about D hooks onto RURALISE for big scores. But I'm giving up big scores at 4L here so my play doesn't accomplish anything other than leaving CINS.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EHX L10 HEX +52 169
#note Cesar had HUMIDEX with a blank in there somewhere. So I guess WAVE did accomplish something. HUMIDEX still plays at 14F but it's not worth as much.
>Charles_Reinke: ACDINPS 3B CAPSID.N +82 226
#note Phony. CAPSIDAL is the word I probably generated this from. Feels good to be the one getting his phonies to stay on the board for once.

#note Fishing is okay here with row 1 open.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: Q F2 Q. +31 229
>Charles_Reinke: BEGIRTT I13 BIG +17 255
#note My punishment for fishing is to draw the same two tiles. Now that row 1 is blocked fishing makes less sense. Quackle likes three plays at N1 (GITE, BITE, BITT) best.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DFNU N1 FUND +28 257
>Charles_Reinke: EEFRTTT 1M E.F +27 282
#note I REALLY should be playing a T off here. 10L (H)EFT seems crazy but with so many TWS's available it's actually okay.

#note 14H S(I)DERiTE is really nice. I missed it, but you'll why I couldn't play it in a bit.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEH 14H H.DE +40 396
>Charles_Reinke: EGLLOTY -  +0 371
#note I was 50/50 on LOCULATED, but really I just didn't want it to be good since I wanted a free turn and being down by 25 didn't seem like a good place to be. So I challenged. I should just play LOG(g)Y here.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: JO 2J JO. +29 425
>Charles_Reinke: EGLLOTY 5A GLO.Y +18 389
#note Now I need to bingo. LOG(g)Y still is best.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AENOT N7 ATONE +13 438
>Charles_Reinke: EIKLNRT O11 LIKEN +32 421
#note Fishing off the R could result in ANTLIKE or GNATLIKE, but Cesar will always block. I was focused on what would happen if I fished off the K and determined that AEILNRT wouldn't do anything on this board.
