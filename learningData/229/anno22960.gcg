>cecilia: AABEERT 8G BA +8 8
#note Quackle says just play ABATE here. BA is too vowel heavy to be a good fish.

>derek_martinez: DEEY G12 EYED +28 39
>cecilia: ?AEISST 15G ..SSIcATE +77 121
#note Lol I had no idea I played a phoney until just now! It's very rare for me to spell things wrong, and this was a convincing enough mistake to trick Derek as well. There are two other 9s available here, both of which score more than mine.
>derek_martinez: INZ L12 ZIN. +24 63
#note Oops, he had ZIN 14M
>cecilia: FGNNRRV 13K F.RN +14 135
#note I regretted not playing the safer FRIG, but Quackle prefers FIRN.
>derek_martinez: ?EEFRSU O7 REFUgES +88 151
>cecilia: BGIMNRR N8 RIM +28 163
#note Quackle gives a slight edge to BRR J10, but RIM guards against a devastating X play
>derek_martinez: AH I13 HA. +26 177
>cecilia: BGNOQVW 12D VOW.. +22 185
#note I first put down BOW at J10 but too afraid to open the 2x2 after his last play. Quackle's favorite is VOG M7.

>cecilia: EEGIILR 12J LE. +17 374
#note A play like PIE 9E or GIBE 6G will likely give me more flexibility in the endgame.

#note I knew I should block STUCK, but couldn't immediately see the way to do it (TRICE), and as usual I'm out of time.
