#note game 20, i just blew the game 18 endgame and out of the money and have no real incentive to do well here other than to not fall below 2000. if i were more motivated i'd realize KNEW was far better (especially after his move). -4

#note i very strongly considered BORNEOLE* here so that the game didn't run away from me, but i got scared and then waited too long. it didn't matter anyway. missed G12 OBOE, though :/ -4.5

#note i did see SPECKLE but it keeps two Rs. maybe that's ok because of the points and D hook. i don't like LAXER because it doesn't take hooks. -4

#note clearly i need to draw ALFAQUIS or something insane. quackle likes exchanging. it does make sense, if i keep ERS or AERS i can get lucky from the B or N and still have a weak lane on the left, maybe.

#note this was a brutal game. Scrabble overall is brutal. i drew poorly after the first day, but I also blew two endgames and missed at least 3 easy bingos in 3 other games. i could have easily gone 13 or 14 wins with poor draws to still cash and maintain rating, but i'm not good enough yet. i guess it's time to prioritize Scrabble a bit more again. i strongly dislike placing badly in a big tournament.
