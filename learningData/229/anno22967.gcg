>Josh_Greenway: ABEIKMT 8G BIKE +20 20
#note I've played William (Bill) Snoddy once before - at 2014 Nationals and came away with a win. I don't like giving up the E here, which is why quackle really likes KAB over BIKE - but if I had known BATIK was a word, I'd be off to the races
>William_Snoddy: EIORU K6 OURIE +16 16
>Josh_Greenway: AFGHMQT J3 MATH +30 50
#note not terrible, but M(E)TH through the E in BIKER would have been much better
>William_Snoddy: AX 10I AX. +26 42
>Josh_Greenway: ACFGJNQ L4 JAG +29 79
#note Two turns in a row I play off my only vowel - more often than not, you then get a rack with no vowels
>William_Snoddy: NV H7 V.N +6 48
>Josh_Greenway: CFNQRST -CFNQR +0 79
#note And here's the rack with no vowels right on cue! quackle wants me to exchange CFNQ, keeping RST. I ended up trading CFNRQ, keeping ST - I figure an exchange this early, you should draw as much as possible in order to try to grab a blank.
exchange-5
>William_Snoddy: DEEIRRT -  +0 48
#note exchange-2
>Josh_Greenway: ?ELLSTU 11C dULLEST +64 143
#note Lots of bingos here - SELLoUT, ScUTELL(A) and gULLETS score more, but I'm fine with dULLEST. (Others I didn't know: pULLETS, cULLETS, TUiLLES and (B)ULbLETS. 
>William_Snoddy: EINW H11 .WINE +36 84
>Josh_Greenway: DEGLNQR 13G Q. +21 164
#note The Q comes back to me, and quackle wants me to play it, or exchange it. Q(U)ERN is ranked higher, but gives a hell of an S hook - I'll take 7 points less and play safe
>William_Snoddy: EE F9 EE. +5 89
>Josh_Greenway: DEEGLNR D8 REL.NGED +76 240
>Josh_Greenway: DEEGLNR --  -76 164
#note I go for a questionable bingo here up by 75 - I guess I'm getting greedy. I figured it wasn't good, and Bill had told me before the game how he creates extensive study tools using powerpoint of all things - and focuses on 7s and 8s. Who was I kidding? He challenged it off saying something like 'I think lunge is the sort of thing you only do once'
>William_Snoddy: GI 4L .IG +11 100
#note makes sense - he knows I do't have an S - and it means he probably does!
>Josh_Greenway: DEEGLNR D10 L.NGED +20 184
#note OMG - I didn't realize at the time, he gave me a bingo here! L(I)NGERED through the I in (J)IG, hooking A(N) and (HOG)G. Oh well, I didn't see it, so I went back to L(U)NGED, dropping a D in the triple line, expecting him to throw an S on the end of JIG. quackle doesn't agree, obvs
>William_Snoddy: AOSTTY O1 TOASTY +43 143
#note Nice use of the S to cut the lead to 41
>Josh_Greenway: BDEHPRV 15A BRE. +21 205
#note Back to one vowel. I grab the triple I just opened. quackle doesn't like this play at all. It would prefer I open yet another triple (I guess that's not a bad idea considering I have so many high point consonants)
>William_Snoddy: EF M3 F.E +14 157
>Josh_Greenway: DHIINPV L10 DIP +24 229
#note I wish I had seen quackle's best play here - VI(N), hooking the I under Q - much better than this
>William_Snoddy: AY N1 AY +22 179
>Josh_Greenway: AHINORV M11 NAH +18 247
#note again, I miss VI(N)O, hooking the I under Q. 
>William_Snoddy: ER B13 ER. +6 185
#note down 68, Bill sets up a bingo line
>Josh_Greenway: IOORTUV 14F VI.O +26 273
#note Hey I finally find it! quackle approves!
>William_Snoddy: CDEOR E5 CODER +18 203
>Josh_Greenway: NORSTUZ C11 .UN +14 287
#note I see the highest scoring play here: TRO(O)Z, for 36, but I go a different way. I block the two best bingo lines, and score 14 with UN, knowing I'll still get some good points off the Z later. Quackle doesn't like it, but I do - in fact, Bill later says this was my key play, as he had a bingo lined up, ready to go. 
>William_Snoddy: ILR 8B RIL. +5 208
>Josh_Greenway: EOORSTZ 6B TRO.Z +36 323
#note Now I grab TROOZ - although it's no longer the best play as per quackle. It now likes ZOO(M), leaving me with ERST. Still, I'll take the 36 point. I also have written down on my scoresheet to check to see if TROOZES is a word... it's not
>William_Snoddy: ACDNOSU B6 .A. +3 211
>Josh_Greenway: CEFINOS I3 OF +16 339
#note not a great play, but it blocks the remaining line (ending in M) which is good, as Bill is clearly fishing with a 1 tile play. If he can bingo that ends in O, more power to him and powerpoint.
>William_Snoddy: IMS 15G S.MI +22 233
#note I think the writing is on the wall, as Bill, down, 128 points, uses the last S to score 22 points
>Josh_Greenway: CEINOSU H1 CON +20 359
#note Ooh - OUNCES hooking (IN)N, (PA)C, and (H)E in the bottom right would have been a pretty play. Instead, I open a line and grab 20 points. At this point I look at what's left and figure there's no bingo coming, so it seems safe
>William_Snoddy: ?ADOPTW 1F DO. +6 239
>Josh_Greenway: EISUW N12 WISE +27 386
#note quackle agrees with me - let's grab some points!
>William_Snoddy: ?AAPT 15M P.A +15 254
>Josh_Greenway: U -  +0 386
#note Oops - I forgot to check for an out play. I have to pass.
>William_Snoddy: ?AT O11 AlT +16 270
#note I challenge this play as I don't know PAWL - but it's good. Another win puts me at 8-3 (with a 5th straight win). I win 386-262 (Bill goes over on his clock by less than a minute)
>William_Snoddy:  (U) +2 272
