#note This is my second ever game against Randy who seems like a nice guy. It's only his 3rd tournament (I played him at NOLA 2015). I reverted to the days when I would come out in game 1's really tight and you'll see the board stays tight all the way through with no bingos to be found. Quackle wants me to play (H)eaved or (W)eaved here vs (W)aved, but I'll keep that one E back thanks!
>Quackle: BGI C11 BIG +19 49
>New_Player_1: AEGGNST 7F GANG +17 41
#note great, a missed bingo GANGSTE(R) on round 2. I'm sure I'll find many more this tournament. 
>Quackle: OTY 9H TOY +10 59
#note This play gets scored at 11, when the actual score was 10. I feel like I never really check my opponent's scores.
>New_Player_1: AEEELST 6I AE +7 48
#note This is a pretty terrible play. Quackle likes 3 AE plays alone better than this. My only defense is I was out late the night before and I'm sure this will be one of my worst games of NOLA 2016. Plus, I'm scared of losing this opening round game against Randy (who I convinced myself had beaten me in our matchup at NOLA 2015)
>Quackle: CHIN 5F CHIN +13 72
>New_Player_1: EEILSTV 10J EVIL +16 64
#note OK so I know EVILEST is in there, but there was no where to play it. I'm sure I took like 3 minutes on this turn trying to figure out if I could play it. So instead, I'm like: "I'll score a cool 16 points, hold EST and open things up!"
>Quackle: Z 9C Z. +21 93
>New_Player_1: AADEEST M10 .EAD +10 74
#note OK I opened it up and missed a bingo on this play! DEA(L)ATES, which I don't know and likely won't remember afterthis. Apparently I also missed E(CHIN)ATED, which, let's face it Quackle, I was never going to find. The play I did make seemed kind of ok? I guess? I didn't mind the lead. 
>Quackle: EI K10 .IE +12 105
>New_Player_1: AEESTTT L12 TE +13 87
#note And another missed bingo: TESTATE, which I'm surprised I've never seen - seems pretty high probability. My play seems fine for a hungover scaredy cat who doesn't want to open much!
>Quackle: IOT 12C ..IOT +6 111
>New_Player_1: AEOOSTT H12 SOOT +23 110
#note the old double O pick up. OK time to burn the blank to make up the marginal lead Randy has. 
>Quackle: ALNO 15H .ALON +6 117
>New_Player_1: AEENQST H4 Q. +21 131
#note Well this kills a line even though I have nice tiles. But it puts me in the lead, yay!
>Quackle: ABCFIRS -  +0 117
#note exchange 4
>New_Player_1: AEEJNST 14G J.TA +19 150
#note God, I missed JE(O)N for 29, playing J(O)TA for 21. I'm terrible. Oh, and I misscored it - it should have been 19.
>Quackle: CDL F10 CL.D +13 130
>New_Player_1: AEENPSU 11I UN. +9 159
#note Missed EUPNEAS - yeah, like I was going to find that!
>Quackle: RU 5D UR.... +22 152
#note This might be the nicest play either of us makes this game. 
>New_Player_1: AEEIPSU D3 PI. +10 169
#note nice leave genius
>Quackle: OT 3C O.T +10 162
>New_Player_1: AEEESUX 8J EAUX +19 188
#note here's where I take away a lane (I must be thinking he has at least one blank by now) - and I think this is the first play that quackle put at the top of the list!
>Quackle: EILMPSY K7 Y. +5 167
>New_Player_1: BEEERSU M6 RE. +11 199
#note I don't think this is a good play, and neither does quackle
>Quackle: ?K 6L a.K +16 183
#note If my play is suspect, then Randy's is not great either, burning a blank for 16. I think I had worn him down by this point and he just wanted to get the game over with.
>New_Player_1: BEEIISU O6 SIB +22 221
#note quackle does not like this play. quackle totally wants me to exchange - but that can't be right with SS? still unseen
>Quackle: AFNR N2 FRAN. +24 207
>New_Player_1: EEIMMPU O1 PEE +22 243
#note I like quackle's #1 play of MUMPE(R) here better than mine, but I'll take the 22 points (I only have one play this game worth more than 24 points)
>Quackle: EFR 4L FE.R +23 230
>New_Player_1: ?IIMMSU 3K MI +9 252
#note glad to see the S and ? pop up here - so this play seems to block the only line left. The score before this play is like 245-231 for me so this looks to go down as an epic low scoring game that I could still lose at this point
>Quackle: ADS 14M SAD +14 244
>New_Player_1: ?IMSUW O12 WI.e +33 285
#note Gotta use the blank sometime, right?
>Quackle: LNOR 13A LO. +4 248
>New_Player_1: MSU A12 S.UM +21 306
#note OK, I'm 1-0! Hooray for me!
>New_Player_1:  (NR) +4 310
