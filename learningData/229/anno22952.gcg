>Peter_Hopkins: EHIR H7 HIRE +14 14
#note Since when is Peter a Vertie? I have no memory of this. Is this new?
>Josh_Greenway: ACOPRTW G8 POW +21 21
#note Quackle agrees! Peter and I have known each other for many years, and have both traveled over 1000 miles (or however far away NOLA is) just to be matched up there. We've played 7 times and my only loss came at NOLA 2015 when I failed to recognize TEL as a legit 3 letter word. I can't event get the 3s right.
>Peter_Hopkins: CEEMR I4 CREME +27 41
#note I held on this - but I guess this is like Creme Brulee, right?
>Josh_Greenway: AACNORT F9 CAN +20 41
#note COAT would have been better than CAN. So would COTAN or CANTO, if I knew them
>Peter_Hopkins: BEFI 5H B.IEF +20 61
>Josh_Greenway: AEIORST L4 O. +10 51
#note OK, SATIRE+O... I actually know this combo doesn't yield a bingo. So, play off the O and bingo next turn - that's the way it's supposed to work right? (Quackle suggests playing off the OI leaving ASTER which seems solid as well - but since I know most (ugh) of my SATIRE bingos, I'll stick with the leave)
>Peter_Hopkins: AIM M2 AIM +14 75
>Josh_Greenway: AEEIRST 12B AERIEST +72 123
#note Hooray - I played a SATIRE bingo! Gold star!
>Peter_Hopkins: ARZ H12 .ZAR +39 114
#note I hate when you play a bingo, and your opponent then makes a high scoring play and you're almost tied and it feels like you got no advantage for playing the bingo. I bet everyone feels that way.
>Josh_Greenway: DDGJNPV 10E J...D +16 139
#note nice job drawing tiles. quackle really would like me to exchange. but I'm not going to! Instead, I'll take 16 points and a horrible leave!
>Peter_Hopkins: BDKNNSU -  +0 114
#note exchange 6
>Josh_Greenway: ADGLNPV B11 V.NG +16 155
#note There are lots of better plays than this. Especially VAG(A)L and PAV(A)N. One day I should study 5 letter double A words.
>Peter_Hopkins: DEIU 14H .DIEU +8 122
#note Peter must have a lot of vowels here
>Josh_Greenway: AADGLPT L12 LA.D +14 169
#note PLAT would have been a nice word to know here. Instead I play LA(U)D (quackle does not approve). The last time I played this word I misspelled it LUAD. I had to write down both spellings on my scoresheet just to make sure this time. I may be an idiot, but I'm trying to limit my idiocy.
>Peter_Hopkins: HOR K4 H.RO +15 137
>Josh_Greenway: AGOPTTV 13H .AG +21 190
#note GAVOT is a word? OTT(A)VA is a word? How is OTTAVA not like the pet word of the Ottawa Scrabble Club. Man, this is a vast and ridiculous lexicon!
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AFOOTU N4 OUTSuRF +78 215
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AFOOTU --  -78 137
#note Had to hold here for a few minutes. I did not like the word, but I had no confidence. I suppose I could have countered with PO(u)T, but that leaves us in a tied position. So I challenged based on 80% certainty that this was a phony. I asked Peter on the way to the computer whether he thought it was good - he answered cagily with something like 'we'll find out' - that answer took me to about 95% certainty
>Josh_Greenway: IOPTTTV M9 PIVOT +32 222
#note So many T's! I love T's, but 3 is overkill. Hey, quackle agrees with my play!
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AFOOTU N9 OF +30 167
#note dangerous play - the type of play I might make if down by 85
>Josh_Greenway: BEEIQTT O8 QI +38 260
#note Two turns in a row quackle agrees! I'm going to try not to let this go to my head!
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AEOOTU 2L T.U +6 173
>Josh_Greenway: BEEOTTY 1I BYTE +13 273
#note quackle thinks I should play (D)OBY or (D)OTY at the bottom right. So many heretofor unknown fours! Instead, I take away the triple line. Unless he has KILO, or MEGA! But he probably doesn't have either of those.
>Peter_Hopkins: DORWY 2E DOWRY +21 194
#note I had to hold here as well. Is it DOWRY? Or DOWERY? Turns out it's both. I was never going to challenge, but I thought about it a bit. I chuckled to myself thinking between Peter and I (both unmarried) we had never given much thought to the word DOWRY/DOWERY.
>Josh_Greenway: AEEIOOT 1E ETA +13 286
#note Again, quackle wants an exchange out of this horrible rack - but apparently I never exchange! I'd rather play blocky-blocky Scrabble while I'm up 79.
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AELNNS -  +0 194
#note exchange 3
>Josh_Greenway: EIOOSTU 15A USE +18 304
#note OTIOSE? Wow, that's a 5 dollar word. Is that the expression? Instead, I'll burn the S for 18 points!
>Peter_Hopkins: ?AELNNS N1 L.N +5 199
#note not sure what was on Peter's rack here. maybe Peter's just getting tired? Or maybe he's setting up ASK or something?
>Josh_Greenway: EIOOTUX 15L .OUX +36 340
#note Look at all these lucious vowels! quackle agrees with this play
>Peter_Hopkins: EK O13 KE. +14 213
>Josh_Greenway: EINNNOT E10 .O.NT +28 368
#note Wow, quackle loves (J)O(I)N way more than (J)O(I)NT! I suppose that's tile synergy right? I go for the extra 2 points.
>Peter_Hopkins: AI 14B .AI. +7 220
#note At this point, Peter's clock is really running down. I'm trying to play quickly to get those sweet overtime spread points
>Josh_Greenway: AEGILNN F1 ..NING +11 379
#note even I can see I have a bingo on my rack, and even I know it can't be played. 
>Peter_Hopkins: ??LSS O1 iS +10 230
#note Oof. Peter has SS??L on his rack. I feel like he should have thought about opening some lines or something.
>Josh_Greenway: AEL 11I ALE +9 388
#note I miss the 15 point LEA, but take the 9 point ALE. Peter is overtime, leading to a final score of 392-220. Peter says this is the lowest tournament score he's made - it was a rough one for sure.
>Josh_Greenway:  (LS?) +4 392
