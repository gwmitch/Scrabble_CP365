>Matthew_Larocque: FGIOSVW H7 VOW +18 18
>Joe_Gaspard: ADD 6H ADD +19 19
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGIINS 5J IF +13 31
#note I should have probably played FI(V)E instead, doesn't give him easy points like IF does.
>Joe_Gaspard: DEIJR 4H JERID +51 70
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGINNS M2 NEStING +80 111
#note gINSENG M1? I figured this would be good enough, even putting a blank letter in the 3x3 isn't a risk I need to take.
>Joe_Gaspard: DEGIOOS 10B GOODIES +76 146
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEELNU 8L A.UE +18 129
#note LEA(G)UE scores 24 and clears my rack leaving EN. I didn't look much farther than A(G)UE here. Fairly big mistake.
>Joe_Gaspard: AOTY E7 TOA.Y +18 164
>Matthew_Larocque: CEELNRU 2J CUN.ER +28 157
#note LUCERNE is a word. I kind of knew it was, but I must not have shuffled my letters enough here. I probably try it if I actually think of it. If I miss the bingo, LEUC(O)N scores 33, but I didn't know that word.
>Joe_Gaspard: OOX F5 OXO +28 192
>Matthew_Larocque: ELLOT O1 T.OLL +18 175
#note Missed rack. I might have had someting like ELLLOTT, I know I had too many consonants and T(R)OLL was an obvious play that I put down immediately.
>Joe_Gaspard: ABY E3 BAY +26 218
>Matthew_Larocque: EILORST N7 O.TLIERS +72 247
>Joe_Gaspard: AKMNRSU 12H UNMASK.R +82 300
#note I was pretty sure this was going to be valid (I think I'd even seen it in a game before), but I guess I kind of gave up too soon. I never even noticed this is the anagram of UNMAKERS. I took a chance that he wouldn't score a lot after his 7-tile draw.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHINPT -  +0 247
>Joe_Gaspard: EFRTW C8 TW.FER +32 332
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHINPT D2 PAH +30 277
#note Yes, I don't know any eights. 13A PE(R)IANTH.
>Joe_Gaspard: AE 13M A.E +20 352
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINTT C3 TAE +22 299
#note Ugh. I was planning to play TETANISE. Than I tried to remember whether TETANIES was a valid anagram. Than I told myself that was stupid, it's TETANUS, not TETANY. That's three bingo misses so far, which is enough to lose games against most people.
>Joe_Gaspard: CIP K9 PIC. +16 368
>Matthew_Larocque: BEINNTZ 10J Z.N +32 331
#note ZINE(S) is 41, but I think I need to hang onto my vowels and hope to draw a 7 that can play there.

#note Not a very good game, I had multiple chances to make it close and missed all of them.
