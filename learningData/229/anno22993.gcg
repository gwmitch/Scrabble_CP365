>George_Macaulay: AAABC 8D ABACA +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEERTW 9D WEE +17 17
#note Or EEW, but I'm not used to that word yet.
>George_Macaulay: BCMO 7D COM +25 45
>George_Macaulay: BCMO --  -25 20
#note At one point I thought this was a new 3 as well, so I set the record straight just in time to catch Macaulay.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELPRT 10B PEAL +23 40
#note I managed to avoid learning APTERAL until now, unfortunately.
>George_Macaulay: BCMO 7H MOB +12 32
>Matthew_Larocque: AAERTXY 11E TAX +32 72
#note Now I miss the huge TAXPAYER. I guess nobody wants to think about paying taxes though, right?
>George_Macaulay: ?ACGNOO 10G OCtAGON +70 102
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHPRUY 12F HYP +32 104
#note I'm not even getting off the ground here.... now I miss 8J YAUPER for 43 points.
>George_Macaulay: NUY H12 .UNY +27 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEORTU 6C OUTREAD +68 172
#note George held because he forgot this rack had 3 words in it. I did not know RAGOUTED aka OUTRAGED.
>George_Macaulay: ADGIIOV 14B AVOIDI.G +84 213
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEINQV 15A QI +35 207

>Matthew_Larocque: DDEINOV 3C .NVOIDED +65 272
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEINOV --  -65 207
#note I shouldn't make these kinds of plays against certain people. No wait, I shouldn't make these kind of plays. I'm not even out of the game yet to get this silly. Come on. (HYP)NOID is cool but I didn't know it.
>George_Macaulay: EHIRR 11J HIRER +31 268
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEINOV D1 DONE +29 236
#note I'm so done.
>George_Macaulay: AEGILOR 1D .IALOGER +80 348
#note DONE
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIINUV 2H NIDE +23 259
#note Let's keep UVI for next turn. IV(OR)IED is awesome because it sets up another useful S hook.
>George_Macaulay: ESSTZ O7 ZESTS +51 399
#note At least it wasn't ZESTERS.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILSSUVW 5H LUVS +24 283
#note I felt a slight sense of gratification for finding a half decent play with this rack. Make no mistake, I was not "in the zone" here.
>George_Macaulay: E 12F ...E +12 411
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKMSTW L9 W..K +22 305
>George_Macaulay: ?EILORT 3I EsTRIOL +75 486
#note Only bingo! He just had to give me the old fashioned Macaulay beatdown after I won by 19 points the other day.
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIIMST 13J MISFIT +34 339
#note I'm supposed to play M(O)TIF for 36 to stop his out.
>George_Macaulay: FNR D12 FR. +12 498
#note He mistakenly thought that this was better than going out.
>Matthew_Larocque: E D12 ...E +8 347
>Matthew_Larocque:  (N) +2 349
#note I played poorly early on and then was sort of apathetic for the rest of the game. But, when I look at it that way, 349 points isn't so bad!
