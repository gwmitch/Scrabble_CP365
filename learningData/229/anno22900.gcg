#note lame start to the day missing FLAVIN
>Liz_Gottlieb: ?CDINPV F6 VI.ND +21 21
#note liz shared her racks with me for this game!
>JD: BFILOOW 7E B.O +13 39
#note totally counter-intuitive play that does in fact sim best - just a waiting move trying to block scoring plays and wait to capitalize on my FILOW rack which should score well with any opening she makes. no need for me to open the board with a clunky rack.
>Liz_Gottlieb: ?BCCEPR -BCC +0 21
>JD: FILNOSW I2 INFLOWS +78 117
#note well, that wasn't quite what I expected to happen
>Liz_Gottlieb: ?EEPRUU 10D PU.U +7 28
#note UNPURE scoring a few points looks good. keeping a longer leave is less important holding a blank.
>JD: AFINRRT 4D TARIF. +32 149
>Liz_Gottlieb: ??AEERT H8 .EsAlTER +78 106
#note nice fit - the new DESTREAM is 3 extra.
>JD: ADELNRZ 3C LEZ +37 186
>Liz_Gottlieb: HIOQSTY 11C QIS +32 138
#note OHS at 5C craftily sets up QI at 6B (and also blocks a potential massive scoring spot for me at row 5). Q setups are among the hardest moves to spot in my opinion.

#note EMPLANED looks pretty unfamiliar.

>JD: AEOOTTY 12J TOY +30 326
#note sadly tomatoey doesn't quite fit. I'm right to start blocking but this play leaves some juicy lanes open. MOTEY at L11 looks a little more effective, or just taking the points for YOOF at H1 perhaps.

#note also UNBEARED
>JD: AELTTWX J5 AXE +58 411
#note worth playing the E for 6 points with lots of vowels in the pool (10 out of 17!)
>Liz_Gottlieb: AEIIIKR H1 KAI. +37 377
>JD: CELOTTW K5 WOT +40 451
#note lucky to draw the O to score big - if I hadn't, then it would be a close call as to whether I can outrun another bingo or not.
>Liz_Gottlieb: EIINORS N4 RESINOI. +63 440
#note Liz really played well through the whole game - only a couple of smallish mistakes with some of the uglier racks earlier.
>JD: CEEGLMT 8L CE.T +27 478
#note a bunch of plays are equally good.
