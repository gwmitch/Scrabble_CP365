#note god, I rpobably spent a good 12 minutes staring at this stupid rack. No TWL7s. I can bingo for 60 but it seems better to fish for the 3x3, since XP may not want to play over there.
>XP: ORXY 11J ORYX +32 176
#note maybe orgy for 36 to block? I guess there are no other good X spots on the board.
>JD: ?IOSSTU 5I STUdIOS +72 192
#note I was excited to get SUMOIST down at K5. this is the best bingo I have, but the question is whether I want to fish again by playing OUST at 12L. I think XP would get pretty damn suspicious and find a way to block, and after that there aren't too many good bingo spots on this board.

#note chris's actual rack, I believe.

#note I basically had no time to play the rest of this game.

#note chris was playing pretty much instantly and I was screwed on this tough rack. I didn't like AMIGA at B11 particularly because it just lets chris play another easy move on row 15. a try that could be worth a shot is GAIN at 2B setting up AGAIN, but chris should have a block on row 3. at least with this play I can maybe score on row 2, or draw a lucky bingo on row 6.
>XP: EOV 14I VOE +21 278
>JD: CEGINRT N5 .N +4 240
#note ain't looking good! I was totally out of time so I fished for CIGARET or GERONTIC on row 2. out of time. things are obviously pretty bad. I think I need to go for UT at K6 which has a good shot of hitting row 6, and can set up unblockable bingos like ANERGIC/RECANING/REACTING.

#note if I can bingo with an F in late position I can maybe win!?!?

>JD: CDEGRTT E11 ..ECT +7 280
#note should I just exchange and hope to draw a miracle bingo on row 7? exchange CDT and start fishing for REGRAFT/ENGRAFT on column B?

>JD: DEGOPRT 7M DOG +10 290
#note I was fishing for PRESIFT at B1 in case XP spaces on the FRITZ hook. it's a 1/60 shot which is better than nothing!
