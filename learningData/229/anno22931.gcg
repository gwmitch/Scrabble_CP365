#note really poor mistake! I have RURALITE 2x2 which will probably get blocked. For some reason I had it in my head that PENICEL* was good, and that he'd spaced out on PEDICLE.

#note PAYED is the obvious play but I really wanted to hold onto my D and E with few to come. quackle actually likes my choice.

>JD: ADEHIIR 3C I.EA +35 250
#note there are a lot of options here. as mentioned before, keeping an E is valuable with a weak pool, but this was too many points to pass up.

>JD: ENNRRTV -NRV +0 278
#note pretty close between keeping ER, ERT and ENRT. ENRT has a bit more disaster potential with drawing Ns in this pool.

#note I was worried about duplicating my N, but actually TONNER bingos quite well in this pool. definitely an inferior fish on my part. DEORT is weak.

>JD: DEEIORT 10A OE +10 308
#note I'm obviously in trouble here after two consecutive short fishes. he probably doesn't have the blank, so quackle's preferred strategy is to score a bunch with TRIODE at 14B and hope to draw the blank. but then my only hope is that jeff somehow repeatedly misses his fish. I thought that by playing short I could perhaps bingo twice and bingo out to win with the second one, but there's not enough tiles in the bag if he bingos anyway, so TRIODE looks like a fair try.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GI 10K .IG +5 377
>JD: DEIMNRT H13 .MI +15 323
#note again, he probably didn't have the blank before his last move, so quackle really likes digging into the bag and playing for the blank and just hoping his fish missed again. MINTED at 3H, then? AMI sometimes gives a spot for his homeless bingos.
