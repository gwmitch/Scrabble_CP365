>New_Player_1: ?EHILPX 8H HELIX +46 46
#note hooray - and easy & big opening play and nice leave! This is the first time I've ever played Maneck. 
>New_Player_2: EEIRT L7 E.ITER +26 26
#note I like it when someone makes a play like this - burns up some good bingo friendly tiles. Oh, but of course it's a phony, so I could have challenged it off. I didn't. I did mark it with my 'I don't know if this is a word mark', so that's something I guess
>New_Player_1: ?DDPSTU 7G DUD +19 65
#note ok so I miss DiSPUT(E)D - I mean, that's bad but not unforgivable - I'm not going to beat myself up too much for that one
>New_Player_2: EO K11 OE +10 36
>New_Player_1: ?ELPSTW K7 W.T +13 78
#note not the best play, not the worst play
>New_Player_2: ADEIR M3 AIRED +25 61
>New_Player_1: ?EILOPS 5F SLOpPIE. +68 146
#note quackle likes all the bingos that hook L on to AIRED as way better than this - but it'sa bingo, so I'm not complaining! 
>New_Player_2: ENNO 4C NONE +10 71
>New_Player_1: AAGHNRV 3D HARANG +23 169
#note seems like there were a bunch of better plays than this, but I'll take the 23 points. OOPS - it's a phony? That's weird. Only acceptable is HANGAR
>New_Player_2: ACEP 2K CAPE +25 96
>New_Player_1: IMNOQVY 1N MY +25 194
#note missed some VINO and VIM plays here that were better as per quackle, but responding to a play like this, all I can see isthe upper right hand corner
>New_Player_2: Z L1 Z. +21 117
>New_Player_1: FINOQTV H1 FO. +18 212
#note I'll take this suboptimal play every time with a lead. not saying it's a good play, but I'll take it
>New_Player_2: AVW 2B VAW +27 144
>New_Player_1: BINQTTV 12J V..B +9 221
#note I'm really at a loss for what to play here. quackle wants an exchange bad
>New_Player_2: CINTU 6B CUNIT +21 165
#note I do not know this word, mark it as such, but do not challenge. 
>New_Player_1: DINOQTT B6 .INQ +15 236
#note doesn't seem like a good play - but hey, I just played a new 4. I must be sobering up by this point.
>New_Player_2: EUY 9B .UEY +17 182
>New_Player_1: ?ADEOTT N9 TOAsTED +77 313
#note Hooray - I actually play the bingo quackle likes best - it scores the most and opens two high scoring spots
>New_Player_2: BFIT D8 B.FIT +26 208
>New_Player_1: AEKLOSS O7 KOA +23 336
#note ok so I miss SKA(T)OLES (I can understand when outsiders say 'that's a word?'), and I probably give OAKLESS* a real good look, but take KOA (quackle wants me to break up the double S with KOAS over the play I make but I find that hard to do especially with a LESS leave, not that I have much room to play it)
>New_Player_2: NU M12 .UN +16 224
>New_Player_1: ELORRSS A7 LO +14 350
#note ok I miss SORRELS here, which I'm going to try to remember as the brand of winter boots. 
>New_Player_2: GJ 11C J.G +22 246
>New_Player_1: ELRRRSS 4L R.LE +14 364
#note appears I will not give up an S in the face of the RRSS leave
>New_Player_2: AAEGIOS O13 AGE +28 274
>New_Player_1: MORRSS 13A ROMS +23 387
#note at least I checked to see what she had at this point, so I'll live with ROMS
>New_Player_2: AIIS F9 SI +21 295
>New_Player_1: RS O3 R.S +3 390
#note hey, I'm on a roll - 2-0, and starting to feel a little better from the late night the night before.
