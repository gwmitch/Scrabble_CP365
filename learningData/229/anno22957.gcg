>cecilia: ?BDEHNQ -BDQ +0 22
#note My exchange keeping HEN? sims wretchedly - nearly 4 points behind HED? or HEND?! I could believe it's worse but I'm surprised by that much.

#note I spent too long on this turn but didn't miss anything better than PARVO.
>john_karris: NOO 6D NOO +21 161
>cecilia: ?AAEINS B8 NAIAdES +74 206
#note PAESANI 12A for 1 more point looks better

#note Considered ONE same place, but the board's not that friendly toward my C, and becoming restricted enough that every point counts. Quackle agrees.
>john_karris: EWY C13 YEW +39 242
>cecilia: DENNPRT 10D .EP +27 293
#note Blehh. Didn't see ADVENT 11B, and I should really choose something like PIN I4, but I was in some sort of weird "score at any cost" mindset
>john_karris: AMOZ J3 MA.ZO +36 278
>cecilia: DINNRTT 3J .INT +12 305
#note For the next three turns I screw up really bad. Somehow I thought MATZOT was no good and it was only MATZOTH. MATZOT/TINT is the play here.
>john_karris: DDEEE 15C .EEDED +36 314
>cecilia: BDLNRTU 4G B.L. +12 317
#note Not happy that he played all those Es. Again the best plays make MATZOT, but I also failed to spot BUND L1 until a second after hitting my clock.
>john_karris: UW F13 WU. +9 323
>cecilia: DINRTTU L1 DU.T +14 331
#note I leave myself at risk of Q trouble, but I can't worry about that now.
>john_karris: AEILRSS 14H AIRLESS +71 394
#note Great. Safest option for John is probably RESAILS at N1.
>cecilia: BIINSTU 1L .IB +6 337
#note I played this fairly quickly (shockingly, I'm low on time) but its winning percentage is only 10%. There are actually two plays that purportedly have a 30% chance: BIBE G2 and DUB 10H! I don't understand this at all, am I supposed to draw stuff through the D? Do the extra points make the difference?
>john_karris: AEGIRTV 2N AG +14 408
#note The upside of playing DIB was it distracted John from finding his bingoes.
>cecilia: INQRSTU L8 SQUINT.R +88 425
#note And now I get my miracle draw... only the C or V can lose it for me.
