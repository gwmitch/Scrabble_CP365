#note Quackle is suggesting WOG at G7 for 13 points, but I'm not crazy about it. I'm putting myself in a position where I'll need to bingo, whereas a few decently scoring plays like WARMING could catch me right up.

>cecilia: AAEFGLP 4E FAG +21 47
#note PAWL at 6B scores more, but now I actually do need to keep a good leave and bingo ASAP

#note lucky break he doesn't spot NIDATION at 11D
>cecilia: EEFIIMR A6 FERMI +35 120
#note Missed the superior IMINE at C2. Not used to seeing EEW at all!
>guy: EO A1 OE +20 205
>cecilia: BDEIITT B10 DEBIT +31 151
#note BITTED K3 sims even with DEBIT, but I don't like how it restricts the right side of the board

#note Loath to give up my P for 15C, but what other choice do I have?
>guy: AAHLO O6 ALOHA +28 350
>cecilia: ?AOSTVV H1 VAVS +42 314
#note Even though he's bingoed 3 times and me zero, I'm still kicking a little. VAVS gives me a 22% chance, if only I can draw well enough to hit row 15 or column K...
>guy: AEELOST K2 OLEATES +77 427
#note Or not.
>cecilia: ?CINOTW L1 TWIN +27 341
#note If I could bingo now at 15C, I would actually still win! But at least I find the best play, blocking JAY at J2.
>guy: ?EJNRTY L9 JER. +28 455
#note Almost. Guy was actually unsure of whether it's JERKY or JERKEY so decided to play it safe.
>cecilia: ?CO 14H COs +13 354
#note SOC 15C. Not used to seeing that one either.
