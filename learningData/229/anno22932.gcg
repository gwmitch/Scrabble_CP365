>JD: ACEGIOQ 8G QI +22 22
>Seth: BB H7 B.B +7 7
>JD: ACEGLOY I5 GOY +22 44
#note I really wanted to keep the BIBE hook open in case seth had forgotten it.
>Seth: EFH J6 FEH +38 45
>JD: ACELLNR H1 CELLA +27 71
>Seth: ADVW 2E WAV.D +14 59
>JD: AACNNRU 1A ANURAN +28 99
#note as expected, he blocked CANNULAR.
>Seth: ?DEFGRT K4 DEF +23 82
#note I think seth said he had GRAFTED/BIBE on this turn had he seen the hook.
>JD: ACEENOT K8 ACETONE +73 172
#note maaaan, I am really not in the habit of looking for OFFA yet.
>Seth: ?GILRTT A1 .TTaGIRL +74 156
#note AGLITTER is 3 valuable extra points...
>JD: DEEIIJP -DEEII +0 172
>Seth: APX L12 PAX +43 199
#note he spent a long, long time on this move.
>JD: EEENORV 14J V..ER +46 218
>Seth: AIRY 4K .AIRY +26 225
>JD: AEEINOS B1 .AOI +15 233
#note this would've been a great opportunity to cash an S and score some points with 3 more esses and the blank unseen. instead, I made a weak fish, and left a massive scary bingo spot untouched.
>Seth: DEINRST O8 TINDERS +93 318
#note not playing NOISE immediately comes back to cost me
>JD: ?EEENOS G2 .EE +12 245
#note I can also scrounge some extra points by playing SEE/OFFS.
>Seth: GUU N2 GU.U +10 328
>JD: ?EINOST C3 ONlIEST +74 319
#note Ideally I wouldn't block BIBE, but couldn't see a way not to.
>Seth: HKOOS D8 HOOKS +43 371
>JD: ADEEIOR E8 ODEA +34 353
#note things obviously aren't looking so good. with a tight board, I figured I would just try to score and hope that seth trips up over the ungainly tile pool. another try is OAKIER at 11B hoping to set up a giant Z play at B10, but Seth is pretty sure to block.
>Seth: MM M3 M.M +26 397
#note fortunately for me seth didn't play a power tile on this play, which means he'll quite possibly be stuck with one of them on his final rack. he didn't want to empty the bag, but here it might be advisable. Also if he plays MUM at 3M I most likely lose, so I was lucky he didn't look for longer!
>JD: EIILNRW O1 WIN. +38 391
#note worth a try! I was able to slap this down immediately and leave seth only two minutes to find a win.
>Seth: IJPSTUZ M9 ZIPS +30 427
#note seth only has one win here, SIZE/BIBS for 41 which wins by 2 points. I saw it and was sweating in wait for his turn...
>JD: EILOR C11 OILER +19 410
#note fortunately this was enough to snag a miracle win! probably my most thrilling game of the tournament. I can make life difficult for him if I draw a T or S at the end also, but this was the best possible draw for me.
