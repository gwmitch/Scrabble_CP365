#note definitely a risky move. I thought about JINN at J4 for 10 less, but this is too much to pass up, and even if she takes column O I can still hook VAWS.
>Emily_Brodeur: OPX L4 POX +35 110
>JD: ILMNRST G8 ..LM +8 94
#note I still didn't want to take column O yet. BALM is pretty fishy, but I wanted to get back into the lead as fast as I could, rather than playing for 20 and depending on a favorable draw. right now my biggest edge is still column O and hoping she still hasn't drawn a hook yet.

#note I missed a good opportunity here to cut down on the volatility. STIR at O12 burns my S, but there are 3 more coming and after STIR there isn't really a great spot for it. meanwhile she's just turned over 5 tiles and the chances of her having one of the hooks (or having just drawn a blank) are well over 50%. hence, take the 11 extra points for STIR and keep a still reasonable NRT leave.
>Emily_Brodeur: AADEEMT O8 EDEMATA +95 227
#note of course, her actual play really makes me wish I had seen STIR! realistically, I gave her 3 chances to hit a very volatilte spot, and should've blocked it the last turn when I had the chance.

>JD: ?HIIOSS --  -83 218
#note this is a time when playing a deliberate phony seems justified. the board is pretty locked down and my best play other than a phony attempt is HI for 20. This word should be well outside of Emily's study range. my win % after HI is about 5%, about 15% after HISTOSIS* and about 1% if I lose the challenge, so I should try this bingo even if I only estimate a 1/3 chance of it staying on. it could be a tough challenge too, because if she loses her turn I can make it basically a tie game.

#note credit to Emily for challenging my phony attempt in about 5 seconds. I guess it was kind of lame.

#note not COESITES because I need to allow for the possibility of a miracle overlap bingo on column B.

#note just trying to open and pray. if she somehow royally screws up I could draw OUTFIRE (1/36 chance) and win. actually an awesome try is fishing for QUARTER at B6 for 99 (have to draw QU, also 1/36 chance) except that there's no reasonable play I can make with FI that would distract her from blocking

#note didn't do too much wrong other than missing my chance to block the JOIN hook, another game against a strong intermediate player on their way up! Good luck to Emily on continuing to climb the top 20 ratings gain list.
