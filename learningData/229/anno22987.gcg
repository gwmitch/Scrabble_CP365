>Matthew_Larocque: CFILNRR 8G FIRN +14 14
#note The third game in our little mini-series this tournament. Quackle says FLIR. It gives him an extra hook using the T, but I guess the leave is better enough?
>Jason_Krueger: OY 7F YO +12 12
>Matthew_Larocque: CILRRST G5 CR..T +11 25
#note CR(Y)? I think I really need to dump the extra consonant here, too great a chance I have to dump again next turn. Dunno, LIRST looks like a better leave than LIRS, but I need vowels to make it work....
>Jason_Krueger: ELRSY K8 SLYER +24 36
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEILRS 10A AERIALS +72 97
#note No eights.... not that I would find them anyways
>Jason_Krueger: DLOPRSU A6 UPLO.D +27 63
#note This might have been his rack, because he said he wondered if DROPULES was a word. He would have had POULARDS for 89 here in that case, which means I got lucky.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHINTU B5 UH +26 123
#note No bingos.
>Jason_Krueger: MOPST 12A STOMP +31 94
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEINT 13C DEE +22 145
>Jason_Krueger: OVW 12J V.OW +20 114
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EHIINT I4 INHE.ITs +62 207
#note The worst bingo. I didn't really know any of the others, the best being 2x2s LECITHIN and NITCHIES.
>Jason_Krueger: BDIR H1 DRIB +37 151
>Matthew_Larocque: EEJNNOU 4H ..JOU +28 235
#note For some reason I thought this might only be valid with the X. Jason must have thought the same thing, since he held the play.
>Jason_Krueger: ABG 14B BAG +22 173
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEINNN 13L NENE +20 255
#note I've developed a bad habit of opening 3x3s against Jason. I have to play this though, right? Or maybe 13L NEE is a good compromise.
>Jason_Krueger: DFO O12 F.OD +36 209
>Matthew_Larocque: EEINOOW 5I .OW +31 286
>Jason_Krueger: EKX M2 KEX +50 259
#note "There it is!"
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEINO 2J ENO.I +22 308
#note I never want to keep AAE, but I wanted to keep scoring and 22 was enough for me.
>Jason_Krueger: AGL 6K LAG +10 269
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEGITZ 15A ZA +37 345
#note Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
>Jason_Krueger: ?CEIRST O2 STICkER +87 356
#note Impending pre-endgame implosion.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGINTU 14F UNITAGE +65 410
#note Crisis averted. I was so focused on trying to determine if I could win by going out before he did, I felt like a dumbass when I realized I had UNITAGE. I saw AUGITE 15D first, and probably would have settled on that play if the game wasn't on the line. I have to wonder how this turns out if Jason bingos down here, preventing me from playing UNITAGE. I'm almost certain I lose, because he then has QI for 44 up in the corner.
>Jason_Krueger: AAEIMQV 13H QI +26 382
>Matthew_Larocque: AT 6E TA. +12 422
#note Missed the 13 point spot.
