>Juraj_Pivovarov: CGINO 8D COIGN +22 22
#note Playing for 3rd place in the upper division, Mr. Larocque? Time to go out with a whimper!
>Matthew_Larocque: DELTTUV I5 DUVET +23 23
#note Good thing I added COIGNES to my vocabulary.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DEILP 5F PID.LE +20 42
>Matthew_Larocque: AELORTX H1 RAXE. +42 65
#note LOXED
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIR 6D REI +11 53
>Matthew_Larocque: ALOTTVZ 2F ZO. +32 97
#note I don't think I even considered not playing the Z, something like LOV(A)T is a huge point drop.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEGIMNR D8 .REAMING +80 133
#note I knew it, I'm playing JURAJ PIVOVAROV in the last round. The precious moneys envelope was dangling in my face, and Juraj has the fishing rod... I could already sense the incoming futility of the last game curse. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ABLSTTV C10 BLAT +26 123
#note It's funny because the imaginary sound I was making in my head after he played creaming was something along the lines of "BLAT!". 
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ABINORS K4 S.AROBIN +70 203
#note You're only up by 80 points, better bingo again to be safe Juraj.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFIOSTV E11 VAT +32 155
#note VITA to get a few extra points.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AQT J10 QAT +65 268
#note YES!!! THAT'S HOW YOU SHUT THE DOOR IN SCRABBLE. 
>Matthew_Larocque: FIOSW L8 WOS +35 190
#note I debated keeping my S, but then I remembered it was the last round, so I just reduced the spread.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EHRSW 13J SHREW +35 303
#note Nice and dangerous, Juraj going for 500 this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFIOTY M7 FEY +35 225
#note I'm going to call his bluff and leave that hook wide open, maybe I'll get lucky. No wait, no I won't.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: KLNU 4K .LUNK +28 331
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIOTU 15A GOU.E +21 246
#note Instead of the other GOUGE to go for an ING bingo.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?JNY O1 JuN.Y +54 385
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIIPT 3G E.IT +16 262
#note My junky isn't as good as your junky! But PEE(W)IT is playable for 34, I only knew PEWIT.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ADIOU O11 AUDIO +34 419
#note VOWEL DUMP, 34.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFIIPR F10 FE +20 282
#note miniscule chance to bingo if I draw repining/ripening/piercing etc.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ACHN A11 CHAN. +15 434
#note Well except he can just block anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIOPR -  +0 282
#note I didn't know CHANG 100% so might as well.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: LMOT 15K MOLT. +8 442
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIOPR D1 ROPIE. +18 300
#note Oops.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?ADS O1 .....ArDS +66 508
#note This is the only possible way this game could have ended. For reference, Joe Gaspard, the guy who steamrolled the entire division, stated that even for him, this would have been a tricky play to spot. I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders. But actually, congrats to Juraj for pulling out a well-deserved third place finish. I know he studies an infinite amount more than I do, I'm a lazy ass that studies like 3 times a year :P
