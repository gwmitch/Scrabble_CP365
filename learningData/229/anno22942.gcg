>Josh_Greenway: EGIOOPU 8H PIU +10 10
#note quackle wants me to exchange here, holding EP... seems like a better idea than what I do. This is my first game ever against Jeff
>Jeff_McAlpin: Q I7 Q. +21 21
>Josh_Greenway: AEGGNOO 9F GOO +9 19
#note quackle likes goa much better than goo - not sure why - same points, and I keep an A vs an O. Maybe because I'm holding a G? Oh wait, it's because my quackle isn't updated and sees PO as a phony. I gotta fix that
>Jeff_McAlpin: LOW 10H LOW +19 40
>Josh_Greenway: AAEGMNU 11I MENU +21 40
#note I like quackle's play of AGUE / (POL)E much better than my play
>Jeff_McAlpin: EH 12K EH +22 62
>Josh_Greenway: AAGIMRV 8C VIGA +12 52
#note this seems like my first sort of OK play
>Jeff_McAlpin: NN D8 .NN +3 65
>Josh_Greenway: AAMNRSS E10 ARM +12 64
#note I was going to totally play RAN(G) here, but then picked up the tiles and played this. That was a mistake. Neither play is great, but see what happens...
>Jeff_McAlpin: INOORST E1 ROOSTIN. +68 133
>Josh_Greenway: ACLLNSS 13A CALLS +20 84
#note apparently the best I can do here
>Jeff_McAlpin: BU A13 .UB +21 154
>Josh_Greenway: DDEJNST B12 J.NE +30 114
#note Wow, I totally missed JEST(S) for 40. That would have been helpful. My play still scores 30, but it's a bad leave
>Jeff_McAlpin: EIKL 1A LIKE. +30 184
#note I held Jeff on this play - for some reason I didn't think this was good - but didn't pull the trigger
>Josh_Greenway: BDDERST 6D B.D +10 124
#note where are the vowels?
>Jeff_McAlpin: DDIY C1 .IDDY +28 212
>Josh_Greenway: DERSTTY 2E .Y +13 137
#note missed the bingo TRYSTED, instead play just the Y, hoping for an O I guess for DOTTERS or an A for STARTED (though not sure where that would have played)
>Jeff_McAlpin: AAEFOOW A1 .EECHErS +95 307
>Jeff_McAlpin: AAEFOOW --  -95 212
#note This would have put him up by 170 and meant game over, which would have triggered a challenge regardless - but I had a feeling it was LEACHERS that was good. Happy to make a challenge on actual word knowledge here
>Josh_Greenway: DERSTTW 13I DEW +15 152
#note burning my E here seems rough since I'm going to need it to bingo. 
>Jeff_McAlpin: ?CEEEHS 15A ..SEECHEd +98 310
#note Ouch. Held here but was pretty sure it was good - held off on challenging
>Josh_Greenway: AAERSTT 12D A. +12 164
#note Hey, quackle and I agree! that I can say is a good leave
>Jeff_McAlpin: EP G13 PE. +11 321
>Josh_Greenway: AEFRSTT M5 FATTERS +69 233
#note Hey, it's a kind of plausible phony bingo! And it kind of brings me back (to within 88 points anyway). I really thought this was good.
>Jeff_McAlpin: ?GIINRT 4E .TIRrING +68 389
#note ouch. he's killing me
>Josh_Greenway: AAIORUZ 6M .ZO +32 265
#note wow, ZOA(R)IA is a word. well, I missed that, so I might as well open a triple triple lane (holding a horrible leave)
>Jeff_McAlpin: AX 14I AX +53 442
#note ouch again
>Josh_Greenway: AAAIORU N5 A.O +19 284
#note hey, URA(N)IA ia a word. I guess I should learn my 6's one day. In the meantime I'll take 19 points and keep the same horrible leave as last time
>Jeff_McAlpin: EIORTTV H1 OVE.T +24 466
>Josh_Greenway: AAEIRTU O5 T.RA +21 305
#note man, this game really got away from me
>Jeff_McAlpin: FIR L8 IF +14 480
>Josh_Greenway: AEIU 3K EAU +11 316
#note let's go get lunch - I'll escape with a 3-1 records, but Jeff took all my spread! Overall, happy so far
>Jeff_McAlpin: R L2 R.. +4 484
>Jeff_McAlpin:  (I) +2 486
