#note i chickened out on PICRATED. i am an inadequate scrabble player. (all joking aside i really should play words that i am not totally sure of. i was just pretty down because i had lost 5 in a row and wanted to be sure of what i was playing. I would have played PICRATED in many other situations as i was actually reasonably sure it was a word). -44

#note i passed up EcOTONE here but didn't see bOTONEE. i would have played the latter (and he probably would have 3-3ed on me because he had an awesome rack iirc) -19

#note quackle is super smart. i am quite likely to bingo if i play CONIN at 14J (and even if i don't, like drawing the J, i have a good shot at winning with it, like JNANA, JOSH, etc why don't i think of these things?)
