#note didn't think of the simple FOUR. it's doubtful that i'd ever sacrifice this many points but i guess bingoing is very important early... -2.5   (some of this may also be due to keeping IN for PLOTZING)

#note i undervalued WARRIOR too much. i hated such a volatile move though. -1

#note i wasn't sure enough of REWEAR (i also didn't want to give up that many points, but it scores way too much). at the end i didn't play it because of the leave/board shape but i was wrong. -7.5

#note i thought it was worth a try. turns out CARMELITE# is Collins only. there is an alternate universe where that play is good in TWL, i end up drawing the other blank and stuff and win the game and tournament after a play like that. :(  MACHREE maybe, i desperately need a miracle.

#note this is phony, whoops. i need her to keep missing with whatever amazing leave she has. maybe 10B CUB or something i don't know

#note nothing is really going to win here so maybe i keep equitying and hope for multiple miracles. YET O1 scores enough, and the leave is better marginally. -3
