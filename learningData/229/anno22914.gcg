#note AERS is real strong - Q likes fishing with BOO at C13 and reaping the 33% bingo probability (only 10% after CARBO).

#note I thought the only way I could lose was to NAIVELY on column A, but I didn't realize that she threatened massive plays on column H like NAVVY/SAVVY/SYLVA, after which I very well could lose. therefore I should just take a short scoring play - OIDIA at 12I cleverly blocks column H plays, but probably the best is THE/ZINE at F5 which puts me up 48, and concede the improbable miracle bingo.

#note amazingly, my only winning play! this is the weakness of having played ETOILE.
