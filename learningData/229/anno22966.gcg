>Elaine_Livers: AQT 8G QAT +24 24
>Josh_Greenway: EFHRUWY 7H FUR +15 15
#note I play FUR - quackle wants me to play FURY but I'm chicken - I aon't want to give up a vowel hook to that triple square. I first played Elaine at NOLA last year, and got a close win.
>Elaine_Livers: DEINR 9F DINER +30 54
>Josh_Greenway: BEHOTWY K4 WHEY +36 51
#note All these plays are close, but if I did it over again, I would take any of quackle's suggestions here: THEWY (if I knew it), BOTHY (if I knew it) or WHY (keeping that sweet E)
>Elaine_Livers: ?APUVXZ -  +0 54
#note exchange 4
>Josh_Greenway: ABNOOST L3 BOON +29 80
#note Within a point or so of the best plays...
>Elaine_Livers: AEN M3 ANE +26 80
>Josh_Greenway: ?AESTTV -  +0 80
#note Missed the bingo STATiVE. Also missed STAVE (off (WHEY)S for 41). Lots of 20 or 30 point plays beyond those. Instead, I'm up to my 3rd exchange in 10 games, changing out the V. 
>Elaine_Livers: EFLMOOT -  +0 80
#note exchange 3
>Josh_Greenway: ?AESTTU 10A ATTUnES +77 157
#note I probably was stressed when I got a U back, but then I found ATTUnES. I likely missed the other bingos: sTATUES, nUTATES, mUTATES, bATTUES for the same points, then lots more: StATUTE, SiTUATE, ScUTATE, STAtUTE, STATUrE... the list goes on. I'm just happy I found one!
>Elaine_Livers: EFLMOOT -  +0 80
#note Elaine challenges this play - which of course makes me doubt the word, but it stays on the board.
>Josh_Greenway: ABEEGHT A8 BH.T +27 184
#note It's a phony by me. Oops. In fact quackle suggests I play the correct spelling BAHT in the upper right. God, I've been to Thailand too. Anyway, I get away with it, putting me up by 104.
>Elaine_Livers: AIT 8A .AIT +7 87
>Josh_Greenway: AADEFGL 11E EF +19 203
#note not a great play here - should have moved an A. I'm going to try to remember that BOON takes a front hook A to make ABOON (which means above apparently) because that's where all the good plays are with this rack
>Elaine_Livers: AEIMRST 12F SMARTIE +78 165
#note OK, I accept the phony hook of DEFS* here - I did hold, and think about it, but left it on, holding a 38 point lead after the play. I know I've written something down like this before: No DEFS, but there can be FEDS. I just couldn't remember which way around it worked.
>Josh_Greenway: AADEGLO 11J AGO +18 221
#note I get it quackle, it's all about ABOON - but neither Elaine or I know that word! I'm fine with AGO here.
>Elaine_Livers: AJR H12 .JAR +33 198
>Josh_Greenway: ADEELNU 15F UN.EAL +6 227
#note Ooh - (J)EED is a nice play, as is A(J)EE. I don't see those, so I dive in the bag looking for one of SS? still in there (maybe). 
>Elaine_Livers: MU 14E UM +20 218
>Josh_Greenway: ADELNOR I12 .OL. +17 244
#note I play (R)OL(E) which is the #2 move - I do not see the #1: D(R)ON(E) hooking D(AGO) at the top - that's a nice find quackle! 
>Elaine_Livers: EIKNOVY 13C YIN +14 232
>Josh_Greenway: ADEINRV N5 RAVINED +72 316
#note Hey! I found the only bingo in this rack and played it! I was quite unsure about (HOE)R - but it's good too. 
>Elaine_Livers: DPR 8L DR.P +27 259
>Josh_Greenway: CDEIISX 7C XI +36 352
#note I like points. I like doing what quackle would do. 
>Elaine_Livers: KOW 12B WOK +37 296
>Josh_Greenway: ?CDEIIS E1 DEICIeS +78 430
>Josh_Greenway: ?CDEIIS --  -78 352
#note UGH. I was trying to spell DIOCESE but it came out DEICIeS*. I can forgive myself for missing InDICIES (I probably would have misspelled it) but missing DICkIES? That's bad
>Elaine_Livers: GOO 6D GOO +10 306
>Josh_Greenway: ?CDEIIS M8 .ID +11 363
#note not sure what the thinking is here. DICES / (HOER)S would have been a great choice. Instead, I take 11 points
>Elaine_Livers: CEIPS O1 PICES +38 344
#note Elaine takes the spot here with a phony (PICE doesn't take an S). The game is within 19 now, and I've put myself in jeopardy
>Josh_Greenway: ?CEGILS O10 LoGICS +36 399
#note Thankfully, I make the right play here to seal the win. I had no idea if it was good or not. Elaine seems ready to challenge, but doesnt
>Elaine_Livers: EELOVZ E4 ZO. +24 368
>Josh_Greenway: E B10 .E. +8 407
#note I miss (AT)E / (JO)E, but get 8 and win by 53. This runs my record to 7-3 at the halfway point. Feeling pretty good about that
>Josh_Greenway:  (EELV) +14 421
