>Jonathan_Lindh: EKLMPPS 8D KEMPS +36 36
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 20: The Final Game! After a lengthy wait, the final pairings were announced. Sure enough , it was somebody who I have played many times and I was going first! I thought this was a good omen. I made the best play to start off as well!
>Harriette_Lakernick: BEII D8 .IBEI +22 22
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEILPTT E4 PITT.D +21 57
#note 3rd best play! E7 PETIT scores 3 more and offers a slightly better leave. Not a huge mistake at all. -6.3
>Harriette_Lakernick: AUV D2 VAU +20 42
>Jonathan_Lindh: AELLORU -AULLO +0 57
#note 2A LOUVRE for 22 is probably better than trading. This such an ugly draw though.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AHJ C11 HAJ +33 75
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENORTUV E11 TROVE +31 88
#note Best play! I debated between this and TROU. I'm not sure which is better.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EEILNST 15B LEN.TIES +77 152
#note This was terrible. I didn't say hold fast enough and by the time I did and read this play Harriette took her tiles out of the bag. Maybe it was better it happened this way because Harriette had ENLISTEE and SELENITE in the same spot and SETLINES on the H line. THIS IS PHONY!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABLLNUU 14I UNBALL +22 110
#note 14D UVULA keeping BLN is the best valid play. I decided to try a phony (and somewhat common) 6 to clear my rack after Harriette's phony. It worked to perfection. I also stupidly drew from the corner of the bag where I dumped my bad tiles in before TROVE. I picked them up again!
>Harriette_Lakernick: AM 15N AM +14 166
#note Harriette not only accepts without a hold, she blocks an S hook onto a phony for very little. If she tried to bingo on UNBALL, I think I challenge! I think this was the turning point in this game.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACINRUX 15K AX +38 148
#note Best play!
>Harriette_Lakernick: DHS 3C D.SH +26 192
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ACINRU H1 CRANIUm. +80 228
#note 2nd best play! CRUCIANS we meet again! I missed this same word in a game versus Diana Ittner. CRUCIANS would have been 86. I honestly just wanted to go home at this point as did Harriette. -6
>Harriette_Lakernick: AER 13K ARE +25 217
#note Wisely taking out that hotspot.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIIOOW B9 COW +20 248
#note 2F OORIE, F2 WHO? Both probably better due to leave. My play has a dreadful leave but scores about the same and cuts off a lane. -10.7
>Harriette_Lakernick: ILN 13G LIN +9 226
#note Harriette seems close to a bingo. Play misscored as 8. A lot of people underscored their plays against me during the tournament.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEFIIO 14D A.E +14 262
#note Yep 2F AERIE. However since Harriette is fishing I'm not inclined to open the board. Mine is bad from a leave perspective but scores about the same as the top plays.
>Harriette_Lakernick: GGO 2G G.OG +10 236
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFIIOR 3H .FORE +24 286
#note Best play! I loved this find!
>Harriette_Lakernick: NU H11 UN. +4 240
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFIIOW 4J DEF +31 317
#note DEFI is normally best but since Hariette is fishing I'll work with an extra I. This is just fine.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINORST M4 STONIER +67 307
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINORST --  -67 240
#note Bated Harriette into playing the phony DEFS*, which I promptly challenged off. Her only bingo was the 9 letter 2x2 REORIENTS for 86! That would have been awesome...for her!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IIOTWY 6B WIT.Y +27 344
#note Best play! I'm pulling ahead!
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINORST 11G O.TRISEN +66 306
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINORST --  -66 240
#note Before I played WITTY, I double checked to see if Harriette had any bingo through the U. She didn't. ROUTINES and SNOUTIER were unplayable.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGIOY 14A YA +14 358
#note M4 YOGI prevents the endgame catastrophe that cost me a class prize by 22 spread points. Mine was -15.6 back, but I was going for a bingo myself.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINORST M12 T.. +3 243
#note Still REORIENTS!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EGIOOO 5A GOO +11 369
#note 2nd best play! Supposedly 7E TOOM for 17 is 5 equity points better but I think it's a toss up for bingoing.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EEINORS 12M .E +2 245
#note Actual rack. best play for bingoing I think.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EIOQRZ O8 QuIRE +46 415
#note Disregard Quackle. I blew this endgame and the class prize on this play. N10 ZEE for 32 blocking her bingos and leaving places for my Q is best. I was focused on shutting down the triple lane, scoring and ditching my Q, I didn't see the following bingo coming. COUNT UP THE DAMN A'S JONATHAN!
>Harriette_Lakernick: DEINORS M4 INDORSE +68 313
#note Only bingo! That sound is the sound of $250 going down the toilet and going to Chris Kulig, who coincidentally beat me in the opening round.
>Harriette_Lakernick:  (OZ) +22 335
#note Score recorded as 417-334. Harriette's outbingos have cost a lot of spread in two different games now. This one cost me $$$.
