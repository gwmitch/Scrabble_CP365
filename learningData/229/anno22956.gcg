#note Missed GERAH for 6 more at 9C! But Quackle's choice is to fish with HA at 9C.

#note Mark underscored this by 8 points. Probably because he was watching football on his phone for the first half of the game.

#note Crap, I missed REHANDLING here. Actually thought about it and decided REHANDLE wasn't a word. This would have prevented all the badness that was to come.

#note I figured that even if HANDLINGS came back good, he might give me a spot for TERRANE.

#note Difficult turn. Fishing with RET 12L looks like a pretty sweet option, but even then I'm only 18% to win.

#note What now? Since he's not shutting stuff down, I figure he has at least one blank. BIZ F8 maybe? LAIRIER C7?

#note I can't win, but I block his outplay and hope he somehow doesn't see IOTA. A better way of doing this is TOIT setting up YEA since I have other outplays for the YEA tiles.
