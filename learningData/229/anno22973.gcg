#note And here we go with game #2 against Lindsey, back-to-back. What are the chances I can win 2 in a row? You'll have to click through a bunch of turns to find out!
Quckle loves some parallel plays - and COILED / (Q)I / (A)L / (D)E / (I)D would have been a great one i I had found it, instead I settle on LIDO
>Lindsey_Dimmick: DELL J6 DELL +22 50
>Josh_Greenway: AACEINU -  +0 24
#note Wow there are a lot of words with ACNU in them that I don't know. I exchange 6 here - everything except the E
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ABOR 4I .ABOR +14 64
>Josh_Greenway: AAEFPUZ 3K APE +22 46
#note Not sure what to say here - there are better plays - this one sets up an S hook S(AB) - was really just looking to score some points.
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EEHIRRS 10D REHIRES +78 142
#note Lindsey takes a 97 point lead with this play. 
>Josh_Greenway: AAFGSUZ 9E FUG +24 70
#note wow, I totally miss ZA(R)FS for 54 through the first R in REHIRES - jeez. Instead I block some lanes... for some unknown reason
>Lindsey_Dimmick: DIN E9 ..IND +18 160
#note Well, this is a phony that Lindsey plays but I didn't notice
>Josh_Greenway: ?AAKLSZ 5L LAK +15 85
#note There's a 72 point play I missed: (L)AZArS to the middle right triple. That would have helped. Instead I play LAK. I think I was hoping to use my S on it - and somehow I forgot LAKE was a word in that moment. Oh, and LAK is a phony anyway. This is all very confusing to look back on. This is game 7 of day 2 - maybe I was tired?
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ENOX O5 EXON +41 201
>Josh_Greenway: ?AIISTZ N5 .AT +22 107
#note OK, missed bingo: SA(N)ITIZe for 84. Instead I play for 22, to cut the lead to what? 95? Not going well here
>Lindsey_Dimmick: BOY 13C BO.Y +20 221
>Josh_Greenway: ?IIOSSZ C12 O.I +5 112
#note I have a bunch of nice tiles, but I'm not doing anything with them. This seems like a really bad play
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EHT 15A HET +24 245
>Josh_Greenway: ?IISSTZ B10 ZIT +34 146
#note And another missed bingo: SIZIeST, for 74. I then take the 34 and shut down another line
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EMR 14A EM.R +27 272
#note Nice play by Lindsey here for 27 - I hold on it for a minute, but it seems good (it is) and let it stand
>Josh_Greenway: ?CIPSSU 8J .IP +8 154
#note More missed bingos: PrUSSIC and CUSPIdS. Instead I score 8 and open a line
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?AGINOT 2E cOATING +67 339
#note Well this pretty much seals the deal, putting Lindsey ahead by 186. I have a bingo all lined up, but it looks like I'm toast
>Josh_Greenway: ?CERSSU M8 SUCkERS +74 228
#note Lots of bingos to choose from. Also, quackle actually likes playing off one S: (GAB)S / S(LAKE) for 32points, holding CERSU? - I guess that leave is so good that it thinks I'll make 32 now and bingo next turn... umm, does quackle not realize I've already missed 4 bingos in the last 4 turns?
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AFT 1G FAT +31 370
>Josh_Greenway: EINOTUV 2M VIN +19 247
#note This play does not show up on quackle's top 20 plays... surprise, surprise. I think I remember thinking 'let's just get this game over with so I can rest before the last game of the day'
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ACEU 14J CAU.E +26 396
>Josh_Greenway: AENORTU O12 EARN +23 270
#note This would have binoed if not for Lindsey's last play - (Y)O / OUTEARN(S) - I play EARN here when I should have played EURO
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EJ 12K JE. +20 416
>Josh_Greenway: MOTUVWY 3F MY +28 298
#note Type a note here!rough rack but some scoring tiles might be able to limit the spread damage a bit. This is MY first play this game that quackle agrees with
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EGNOSW 9M .NS +15 431
>Josh_Greenway: OTUVW H10 .OW +10 308
#note let's get to the next game. quackling after a disaster of a game like this is painful
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EGOW I10 .WE +16 447
>Josh_Greenway: TUV O1 U. +6 314
#note great, I'm going to be V-stuck. 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: GO 11A G. +3 450
#note Lindsey goes out on this play, making the score 451-314. Turns out she's left an undrawn O in th bag that we wouldn't find until we square the tiles after the game. I thought I had mistracked - but it turned out I had done one thing right.
