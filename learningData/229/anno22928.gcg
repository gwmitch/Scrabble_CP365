#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 18: I couldn't find her name in the drop down box on Cross Tables immediately so I gave her a nickname. Get it? 2 M's on the emblem as Jay Z. During the tournament, I thought how awesome it would be if Joe Edley were nicknamed E Class. Would Joel Sherman be nicknamed S Class? And would Nigel Richards be nicknamed Bugatti? Nigel Richards: The Original Bugatti boy!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEEMRT 9E sTEAMER +72 72
#note 3rd best play! I was too focused on the 7's in this rack to look for YAWMETER! I had a dreadful feeling about this play when it came down. -17
>Maybach: EIOWZ 8A ZOWIE +55 69
#note OOF!
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEGIILR K3 BILGIE. +20 92
#note 4th best play! The bingo doesn't play and I have no clue what to do. Quackle likes A8 ZIG best but mine is only -1.8 behind and mine gets more points and more turnover. I take mine.
>Maybach: AJT E5 TAJ.. +22 91
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEGIRR F3 AGAR +13 105
#note 9A ARE is best apparently but I don;t like leaving F6 open.
>Maybach: ACDNO 8J D.ACON +33 124
#note Good play! I wonder what her other letters were.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EILMNR N5 LEM.NIeR +63 168
#note INFLAMER again! I missed that stupid word in 2 games this tournament. My play is WAY inferior. -13
>Maybach: EOVW G3 WOVE +35 159
#note I want to go home! But I need to win to get close to 1600! I would!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIORSTX 10H RAX +63 231
#note 3rd best play! Surprisngly! 10I OX for 56 is better than this one by 5.3 because AIRST is CRAZY! The board isn't THAT great for bingoing however.

>Maybach: CELNSTY --  -26 159
#note Guy Ingram played a phony 6 on me. My opponents are allowed to play 1 and only 1 phony 6 on me during each tournament. The quota has been met so this had to go.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EHIOPST H1 POET +32 263
#note 5th best play! That's about 12 missed bingos for the tournament. 11C OPHITES for 86 ISOPHOTE at B6 or B3. I MISSED SO MANY BINGOS THIS TOURNAMENT. HOW DID I RECORD 37 BINGOS IN 20 GAMES AND FINISH 12-8? -45.1
>Maybach: AEFIK 11D FAKIE +31 190
#note OPHITES blocks this too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: HIRSTTU 12H RUTHS +27 290
#note FIRTH or FRITH at D11? I don't want to open the board. Mine is OK. Q says -9.6 but I'll take mine.
>Maybach: INNORTU D11 .INO +14 204
#note Force HER to open the board for peanuts. This is what I want!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DINQTUV L1 QUID +58 348
#note SO LUCKY! Best play!
>Maybach: HLOOS 15D SHOOL +36 240

#note Take the free points for QATS Quackle!
>Maybach: FGO J2 FOG +25 265
>Jonathan_Lindh: DNNPUVY C12 PUN +20 407
#note This is supposedly the 6th best play behind 14C POUND but I need to play PONY at B7 taking out some lanes. I thought the blocking could wait a turn. It couldn't.
>Maybach: CEELNRT B2 ELECTR.N +74 339
#note Best play! In all fairness, LECTERN was avilable at 14G but who's to say she finds it?
>Jonathan_Lindh: DINSUVY 4A V.ND +24 431
#note 3rd best play! 14A VINOUS for 31 leaving DNY and DENY in two different locations to go out? YES PLEASE! -7 or so.
>Maybach: ADEEI O12 EIDE +21 360
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ISUY 14C ..SY +33 464
#note Best play!
>Maybach: A 3J ...A +12 372
#note She missed A8 ZA for one more. This is 2nd best. -1.
>Maybach:  (IU) +4 376
#note I REALLY should have broken 500 with OPHITES! But not cigar. Did OPHITES cost me the class prize?
