>Josh_Greenway: CEOPSTU 8D COUPE +24 24
#note Well, quackle agrees with this opening play - which is good, because I'm playing against a tough opponent. This is my first game ever against Lindsey - but by the time this tournament is done, you'll see that we play 4 times in the last 7 rounds. At this point, Tim O'Hara Jr, Lindsey and I are all 10-3 and share the lead. 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EILORST F7 O.TLIERS +62 62
#note Fantastic. I can remember this moment - I'm picturing that it all falls apart right here
>Josh_Greenway: GMOSTTV 11E V.G +14 38
#note Not a terrible play given my rack, but VOM(I)T would have been better
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EHR H7 H.RE +7 69
#note Lindsey blocks the spot where an A or S on the end of VIG gives access to the triple
>Josh_Greenway: CEMOSTT 6H TOM +19 57
#note quackle agrees again! so far I'm doing well to limit the damage from that bingo
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ERX K5 REX +26 95
#note note how Lindsey is making sure to limit hooks - I'm getting the feeling this may be a tight board
>Josh_Greenway: ACEINST -C +0 57
#note I know C+SATINE yields ACETINS and CINEST - but they won't play, and I can't find an 8 to save my life. There are lots of them: NE(M)ATICS (don't know it), SE(M)ANTIC (don't see it), TAC(R)INES (don't know it), CIST(R)NA (don't know it), CINEA(S)TS (OMG totally should have seen it), (S)CANTIES (don't know it), C(R)EATINS (I guess I know this but didn't see it) and CE(R)ATINS (don't know it). Instead of all that goodness, I exchange the C.

>Lindsey_Dimmick: EE J5 E.E +16 111
#note Seeing me exchange 1 tile puts Lindsey even more on the defensive
>Josh_Greenway: AEIJNST 7E J. +18 75
#note OK so I know that J+SATINE yields TAJINES but I can't see a hook. There is one: S(EME) but this is another missed bingo. Instead I play off the J
>Lindsey_Dimmick: HNO 4H NOH +16 127
>Josh_Greenway: AEINSTT 3C SATINET +73 148
#note success! There are a lot more bingos than this,but I'm locked into it, and it happens to be the highest scoring one. 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: BEU D1 BE.U +18 145
>Josh_Greenway: ?EFINOQ 2F QI +64 212
#note Lindsey has tied the game back up, but I've drawn a blank (good!) but better yet, a QI with an awesome place to play it! 
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AFGR 1G FRAG +30 175
>Josh_Greenway: ?DEFNOS 2J OF +12 224
#note I knew I had FONDESt here, but I didn`t see the other missed bingos. SENDOFf / (S)ENDOFfS, (R)EFOuNDS, F(R)oNDOSE, ENFOLDS, and FO(R)fENDS. Wow, I sure miss a lot of bingos. So I play OF for 12, and it's not really a helpful play (doesn't block anything) but I suppose I like the leave
>Lindsey_Dimmick: NOUY 13C YOU.N +18 193
>Josh_Greenway: ?DEINNS I8 SENDINg +74 298
#note A fortunate draw gives me a bingo (one amounst many like DENtINS, ENwINDS, ENDrINS, ENDINgS). This puts me up 105, and has me feeling confident
>Lindsey_Dimmick: WZ 12H W.Z +19 212
>Josh_Greenway: AEGIMOW 12B MOW +31 329
#note Definately missed some better plays here, but MOW is still top 5
>Lindsey_Dimmick: AB 13I .AB +16 228
>Josh_Greenway: AAAEGIR 1A GRA. +21 350
#note So many A's! I grab 21 playing GRA(B), but quackle hates a leave of AAIE. It has some fancy plays I should of made instead, and of course, I'm opening a nice line for Lindsey
>Lindsey_Dimmick: CIT 5D TIC +17 245
>Josh_Greenway: AAEEINU C5 EAU +10 360
#note So many vowels! I play off EAU to clean up my rack
>Lindsey_Dimmick: EIILLTV 9H ..V +6 251
>Josh_Greenway: AEIILNT A1 .AIN +6 366
#note This feels like quackle doesn't know what to do here. I don't really know either, but up 109, I decide to shut down the line I just opened
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ?ADEKLO L8 cLOAKED +78 329
#note Lindsey pulls out the bingo to close to within 38. I don't know (NAB)E, but that means little. I hold for a while, think about it, track all the tiles and figure another bingo is unlikely. I don't challenge, and will grab some points next turn
>Josh_Greenway: AEILPST 8L .LAP +15 381
#note Quackle suggests some gorgeous 43 (PAISE) and 38 (PIAS) point plays that parallel CLOAKED, but that's too exotic for me to see, so I grab 15 with (c)LAP
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ADDIILY 6B D.Y +22 351
>Josh_Greenway: EIIST M11 TIS +28 409
#note I miss the outplay (P)ITIES, but core 28 points with this play
>Lindsey_Dimmick: ADILR 3K AID +13 364
>Josh_Greenway: EI O8 .IE +5 414
#note I feel lucky to have won this game, and feel very fortunate to have run my total to 11-3 (including 8 straight). I believe I'm in 2nd place, just behind Tim, based on spread.
