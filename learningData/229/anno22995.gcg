#note A Game That Slipped Away: This was a terrible day of drawing tiles.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABFIOS 7H ABO +17 17
#note 9th best play! Best was 7D OBIA for 21 which I didn't see. I spent a full five minutes on this turn. Probably not something I should be doing since all of the plays are about the same anyway. Minor mistake. -5.8
>Jesse_Day: ETX F8 .EXT +27 51
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACFIIS 12A FACIAS +42 59
#note Best!
>Jesse_Day: ADGHMOV -  +0 51
#note And the challenge!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEILRRT A10 RE.ILE +27 86
#note 3rd best play! LIFTER for 27 on the same line is best followed by TRIFLER on the same line. All have about the same equity so no big deal. -.8
>Jesse_Day: INYZ C9 ZIN.Y +58 109
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEMRTUV 6F VUM +21 107
#note Best play!

#note Best play!
>Jesse_Day: ?ADILST -  +0 128
#note Tim challenged!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ILORSTU M1 OUTLI.RS +68 209
#note Best according to Quackle but I need to play the 7 that I looked for but didn't see. 9I TROILUS scores 65 and locks the board down with me in a 78 point lead. Tim may challenge too!
>Jesse_Day: AJT 1L J.TA +57 185
#note Worst case scenario sadly. Things were like this all day.
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEHIKM 8M .KI +21 230
#note 13th best play! Yeah I would put this as amoderate mistake. 4K KELIM with BEH remaining seems best. It really closes some lines and preserves my lead while keeping an ok leave. I did my play when I got tired of thinking. -11
>Jesse_Day: ILTW 4J TWI.L +16 201
#note Why did I not see KELIM?
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEHMOU 2K MO.E +25 255
#note Second best play! It's either this UMBO at E3 for 25. I like UMBO more. -5.1
>Jesse_Day: Q O7 Q. +11 212
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEHIRU 3G HABU +18 273
#note 5th best play! This was dumb and just asking for trouble even though Quackle thinks its ok. G8 GHI Jon! Didn't look hard enough. -9.8
>Jesse_Day: EPR H1 RE.P +27 239
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEIRTY 1D CRYE. +13 286
#note This was a horrible miss. No wonder I lost this game. 11E ATRETIC for the 2x2 and 40. I decided to block the R lane. Game costing mistake. -28.5
>Jesse_Day: ?EGNNOS 11F .ONNaGES +66 305
#note Only bingo! So ticked at myself.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADIRRT 12I ARID +22 308
#note Best play! However I underscored by 2.
>Jesse_Day: ?DIVW 13G WIVeD +35 340
#note Tim underscores by 3. What a disgusting turn of events.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADOORT E3 TARO +17 325
#note Probably 2F ODEA for 25 but my play isn't as bad as Q thinks. -16.7 really Quackle?
>Jesse_Day: GINNSTU C1 STUNG +23 363
#note Best play from Tim! It's a new word too! Do I play CARAT a turn earlier or just hope Tim doesn't have a play here? I dunno.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEO 9I DEE +14 339
#note 7th best play. I screwed up here but I was pissed at my ending draw. 14G ODEA for 26. It's over anyway and I'm low on time. -14.6
>Jesse_Day: IN 9C .IN. +19 382
#note Best play!
>Jesse_Day:  (AO) +4 386
#note I may have been outdrawn, but I should have won. I just goofed on TROILUS and especially ATRETIC!
