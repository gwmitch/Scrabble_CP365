>Josh: ?AEGGNT -G +0 0
#note I miss with G, Q and X if he doesn't give me the tile I need next turn, and definitely miss with the J. I like this, but I can see why GAG for 10 is standard.
>Dean_Porporo: LLUU 8G LULU +8 8
>Josh: ?AEGNRT H8 .NGRATEd +77 77
#note This is phony!!!! What?!?
>Dean_Porporo: ACMP 11G C.AMP +22 30
>Josh: BEIINNO 13C NIOBI.E +22 99
>Dean_Porporo: TUX 12B TUX +40 70
>Josh: AEILNOO 12K OLIO +12 111
#note I immediately realized how bad of a play this was. I should be defending my lead rather than attacking his deficit. 9G O(N)O is just as aggressive but less volatile, and 9F IO(N)ONE does not fish needlessly. 12J EOLIAN is what I would have played had I seen everything. He is probably still clunky given his two previous plays. Now you will see why I lose to Dean Porporo.
>Dean_Porporo: ?BEOSST O6 BESTOwS +83 153
#note I suggested BOSSEST+ after he hit the clock.
>Josh: AAEINVY N9 AY +28 139
>Dean_Porporo: AEGINNT M3 ANTEING +78 231
#note You are not yet witnessing why I lose to Dean Porporo! 
>Josh: ACEEINV L1 VINAE +32 171
#note Now stop. That's what I wished I would have done after he bingo-bango-ed. But I didn't. I decided to phony out of frustration... I wish I would have stopped and written down (d)EVIANCE.
>Dean_Porporo: AIR 1L .AIR +21 252
>Josh: CDEEEIR D10 DE..E +13 184
#note Dean took around 5 minutes to play (V)AIR. I was struggling to try and act like I was looking for something else, but in reality I was praying he wouldn't block DECEI(V)ER/RECEI(V)ED. But as always, Dean outplays me and reads me like a book! 

When the game was over I thought that I needed to know REDECIDE to win, which was comforting enough, as I know I need to learn words. Boy was I wrong. Anyways, I missed REDECIDE and would not have played it if I saw it. 
>Dean_Porporo: AKT E9 KAT +21 273
>Josh: ACEHINR 7A ARCHINE +69 253
#note Dean beautifully blocks CHAINER
>Dean_Porporo: MORY A4 MOR.Y +39 312
>Josh: HLPSUWW K4 WHUP +42 295
#note If hooking DEXIE didn't score massive points, I would have played my S for 7 more
>Dean_Porporo: DEFGOQZ 10B ZE.. +34 346
>Josh: DEFLSTW 15A WEDS +42 337
>Dean_Porporo: IQ 6E QI +28 374
>Josh: ADFLOST 13K OAFS +33 370
#note Unfortunately there was no way for me to win here in reality. I thought I might be able to squeeze something out in the endgame if the J was in the bag or something. I probably should have played OF 14A. Meh.
>Dean_Porporo: EEFIJOR B1 JEFE +32 406
#note Dean noted his mistake here. He said he should have played JEER instead to play his F off for a lot next turn. But actually he should just play OF 14A now, apparently.
>Josh: DDGLOTV 2A V.LDT +9 379
#note Lucky for me, I drew the only vowel left in the pool. The R was in the bag.
>Dean_Porporo: IORR 14A OR +13 419
