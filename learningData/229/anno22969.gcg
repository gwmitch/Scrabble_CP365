>Josh_Greenway: AEILWYZ 8G WIZ +30 30
#note I've played Megan once before and picked up a win at the Reno nationals. Quackle is a-ok with this obviou opening
>Megan_McMahon: KOW 7F WOK +23 23
>Josh_Greenway: AACEGLY 6D CLAY +27 57
#note There are better plays here, but this isn't too bad. The big one would be GALYAC (wow) that has the same meaning as GALYAK - a fur made from lambskin. 
>Megan_McMahon: OOT E3 TOO. +8 31
>Josh_Greenway: AAEGIIO -AAGIIO +0 57
#note I'm surprised quackle isn't screaming for an exchange on this rack. It likes about 5 plays off the top - I go for my 6th exchange in 13 games, trading AAGIIO (which is quackle's top exchange - just holding on to the E)
>Megan_McMahon: ABGR D1 BRAG +28 59
>Josh_Greenway: EGILOSU 1D .UGLE +24 81
#note it's all about that B. quackle likes (B)OUGIE (a wax candle) but since I don't know that, I go for (B)UGLE
>Megan_McMahon: EOP C2 OPE +26 85
>Josh_Greenway: FIINOSV 2G IF +12 93
#note weird rack, weird suggestions by quackle, weird play
>Megan_McMahon: ?DEEIRT 9B RETIrED +78 163
#note Megan takes the lead here. Wait, is YOWE good? I hold and have a long think about it. I don't think I've ever seen it before. I challenge! 
>Josh_Greenway: INOOSSV -  +0 93
#note bad challenge
this puts me in a real tough spot - down 70 with a tough rack
>Megan_McMahon: ANY 8A NAY +25 188
>Josh_Greenway: INOOSSV E8 V.NO +14 107
#note could be better, but it moves the V, moves an O, and opens a line
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT 3H SLAINED +74 262
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT --  -74 188
#note This did not look right to me - I challenge and it comes off
>Josh_Greenway: ?GIOSST 12B TOSSInG +76 183
#note Nice pick up from the bag. I'm not sure if I had figured out that Megan had DENIALS on her rack or not - but I knew she had good tiles. This seems like a good place to play this bingo. The top choices (STOGIeS and STInGOS) may have opened better lanes for Megan
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT 3H SALINED +74 262
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT --  -74 188
#note I'm pretty damn sure this is no good - Challenge!
>Josh_Greenway: BDFLOSU 10A OF +27 210
#note I'll take some points and not open anything up thank you. SOBFUL is quackle's favourite play (given to sobbing)
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT 11H ADLINES +69 257
>Megan_McMahon: EEEENRT --  -69 188
#note I worked as a copywriter for 10 years - felt pretty confident this was no good either - challenge!
>Josh_Greenway: BDJLSTU C11 J.B +24 234
#note I think by this point I know Megan has DENIALS (she also has SNAILED, which plays, but neither of us see that), so I'm just not going to open anything she can play DENIALS on. And to boot, quackle likes J(O)B best
>Megan_McMahon: D C7 D.. +9 197
#note Megan plays off one tile to switch things up
>Josh_Greenway: DELPSTU H12 .ULP +21 255
#note quackle like PSEUD, hooking under JOB, whatever that is (a person pretending to be an intellectual - sounds like me!). I'll take the much easier to find second choice, (G)ULP
>Megan_McMahon: AEEENQV G1 ..N +4 201
#note Megan is in full on fishing mode here
>Josh_Greenway: ADEQRST -Q +0 255
#note Wow - the top play is a 72 point non bingo: (WIZ)ARDEST! I go with the second best move, exchanging the Q
>Megan_McMahon: AEEEENV 2B N.. +6 207
#note Megan is not giving up on that bingo. between 3 plays challenged off, and 3 1 tile plays, she's gone from up 188-107 to down 207-255. 
>Josh_Greenway: ADERSTU 15G U.DATERS +62 317
#note Never like drawing the U out of the bag, but in this case it makes a bingo! More than one actually, as I missed (P)ASTURED for 86, skipped (WIZ)ARDEST again for 72, and played U(P)DATERS (could have also been U(P)STARED) for 62. 
>Megan_McMahon: AEEEEUV -  +0 207
#note Megan challenges, but the word holds up
>Josh_Greenway: AAADENV N12 VAN. +14 331
#note I go with VAN(S) to block thing up - quackle would have gone for many more points with VANDA(S) (a tropical orchid)
>Megan_McMahon: IL 1A LI +8 215
>Josh_Greenway: AADERRT 14J DA +16 347
#note This thing keeps on me about extending WIZ, in this case to (WIZ)ARD. Instead, I take 16 with more blocky blocky goodness
>Megan_McMahon: AEIIMOR B12 .AE +10 225
>Josh_Greenway: AEEMRRT 4G TEAMER +22 369
>Josh_Greenway: AEEMRRT --  -22 347
#note Up 122, I go for more points, getting greedy. It's no good, and Megan challenges it off.
>Megan_McMahon: AEN A13 NAE +16 241
>Josh_Greenway: AEEMRRT 13K MET. +17 364
#note This doesn't appear on quackle's list of top 20 moves, but it scores 17, and doesn't give away much (if Megan can play an 8 to an E, she's deserves it)
>Megan_McMahon: ISX B4 SIX +31 272
>Josh_Greenway: AEIQRRR 5A Q. +11 375
#note So many Rs all of a sudden. I don't want to get Q-stuck, so I take my 11
>Megan_McMahon: EHHIIMO 12L HI.E +34 306
>Josh_Greenway: AEIRRRT O7 RETIR. +18 393
#note I miss a bingo here - TARRIER / (LIN)T, but I'm focused on the triple line that just got opened, so I take it
>Megan_McMahon: CEEHIMO N8 HEM +31 337
>Josh_Greenway: AOR 4G ORA +8 401
#note And it's over. I win by 76 to run my record to 10-3 (and 7 straight). I'm starting to get ideas now - and that's usually horrible for business
>Josh_Greenway:  (CEIU) +12 413
