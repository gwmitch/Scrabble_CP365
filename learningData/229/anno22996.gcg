#note Best Play!
>Jesse_Day: ACINU 9D UNCIA +11 11
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEJMSVW 8A SWAM +43 73
#note Best play!
>Jesse_Day: OPW 7G WOP +26 37
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEEJRUV B6 JA. +29 102
#note I didn't like this when I put it down. L3 VEEJAY for 38. -9.1
>Jesse_Day: DEFI L4 EDIF. +24 61
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEHRUV 5G RUCHE. +24 126
#note These same letters can be used for 31 at K1. On the other hand. I can just play CURVED in the RUCHED spot for 24. I like that better because it doesn't give up much and gets rid of a V and U. -7.
>Jesse_Day: AEIRSV E5 RAVI.ES +50 111
#note This was a great play by Tim.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILRVXY 4F VEX +40 166
#note Best play!
>Jesse_Day: BEINZ D2 ZINEB +38 149
#note Misscored as 40.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEILNRY K8 .RINY +20 186
#note 2B DIZEN? 2B YEZ? I7 PALY? I had no clue here but I didn't want to open the A line for big scores. If I'm playing at K8, I probably need to do BLINY, not BRINY. Also considered BINDERY in same spot. -10.6
>Jesse_Day: AEER 2B RA.EE +32 181
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEKLNO 1F pLONKED +90 276
#note Best play! And only bingo! I avoid chickening out on this and just play it.
>Jesse_Day: ILNNOQR -  +0 181
#note Tim challenges.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGPQTTT 10J Q. +31 307
#note I don't even see C1 QAT but the J10 spot maybe worth blocking anyways. It worked out. This is 2nd best to QAT.
>Jesse_Day: MOT 1A TOM +21 202
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGPTTT 3A PET.T +29 336
#note Best play! I loved this find!
>Jesse_Day: ?IILRST 11H ReI.LIST +68 270
>Jesse_Day: ?IILRST --  -68 202
#note It's only REENLIST! And Tim missed STRIGILS!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADEGRT 11A GRAD. +7 343
#note Normally 2J ADAGE for 32 is best. However, that gives him SILTIER which should be easy to spot. GRADS aor DRAGS at A11 take out the S lanes and STRIGILS.
>Jesse_Day: ?IILRST A11 .ILTS +21 223
#note Q likes 11I LIN for 14 but that's dumb since the board is closed and that play opens no lanes. Tim's play seems fine to me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEENOTT 2J ATE +18 361
#note Normally, I do 2J ATONE for 27, but since I know Tim has a blank and a bingo friendly leave and a blank, I opt to keep the board closed. ATONE, OATEN, EATEN, and EAT all open lanes. This is best given partial rack knowledge for that reason.
>Jesse_Day: ?EFINRU C10 F.IR +14 237
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNNOOT 13C .ONTOGEN +61 422
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNNOOT --  -61 361
#note This is me being greedy. It's RONTGEN and I got them confused. 15A SONG for 7 and F12 OOGENY for 12 are the plays here as they don't open any lanes. Everything is bad here.
>Jesse_Day: ?EGILOU 12K .OU +12 249
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGNNOOT M10 GO.T +10 371
#note Quackle is of no help as I am trying to block a bingo. Nothing I do blocks things entirely, but I can avoid giving Tim a 3x3 or a triple lane. This play is OK enough.
>Jesse_Day: ?EIILOS 13C .OILIESt +59 308
#note 14H OILIEST, LIONISE or IDOLISE are 72 and best from a equity perspective, but they do give up more on the comeback. This bingo is the worst and actually rates behind J10 QI, but I think this is fine.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGHNNO 6K N.GH +18 389
#note Not good. OHING or AHING for 27 at J6 were my plays. This stinks. -11.6
>Jesse_Day: LO 12G LO +8 316
#note Well Tim doesn't play an optimal endgame either. The hard to see COPAL at I5 gets him at 19 but I don't think I find that either. N9 LO for 9 at least. -11.
>Jesse_Day:  (AENO) +8 324
#note Taking out the blocking plays which were correct due to full and partial rack knowledge on various plays, my total equity loss was only 42ish for the whole game. Good, but I need to stop on those mild to moderate misses which cause the drip drip effect of small(er) mistakes that add up. Good end to a terrible day!
