>Ross_Brown: ADO H6 ADO +8 8
>Josh: ?DIILNO 5B LIaNOID +70 70
#note This game was horrible on many levels. First things first, I miss LOIDING
>Ross_Brown: ADMN 4A DAMN +26 34
>Josh: ?AEOTVX 6D VOX +61 131
#note But it's OK, because I draw unbelievably well sometimes.
>Ross_Brown: EIOOW 7E WOO.IE +28 62
>Josh: ?AEGNRT K5 GARNETs +89 220
#note This rack looks familar. See turn 2 vs. Dean Porporo. I lost that game. Think I can manage to lose this one?
>Ross_Brown: IQ L4 QI +25 87
>Josh: EGHILOY 6J Y. +26 246
#note This was the epitome of a lazy play. But I didn't want to open the board and I wanted to scare/anger Ross.
>Ross_Brown: DFI M3 FID +30 117
>Josh: EGHILOR 10E REGOLI.H +66 312
#note I had a 13% chance of drawing into a bingo next turn. Had to draw a U or an R
>Ross_Brown: A C3 A.. +10 127
>Josh: ABGNOTV 8A GAVOT +37 349
#note Notice that at the peak of my lead this game, I am winning by 222. I ask again. Can I blow it?
>Ross_Brown: EINRSTU M7 NUTSIER +81 208
#note Nice rack ;)
>Josh: ABEEHRU A1 HUE. +24 373

#note here goes. 
>Ross_Brown: OY 14N YO +24 256
>Josh: ACENRRS 15H CRANERS +88 466
>Josh: ACENRRS --  -88 378
#note Right after I hit my clock: Ross - "Hold. You can draw your courtesy tiles, I am going to hold for more than 15 seconds. Of course that's if you want to draw them... I have a play there."

My thoughts in response: "What?! I can't draw my courtesy tiles immediately! Not even if a director tells me to. And anyways, I know you will challenge the moment I draw them, and I know that I am phonying, so why give you rack information? Meh, whatever, I'm bored, and it's been 30 seconds." I draw my courtesy tiles and Ross immediately challenges...
>Ross_Brown: BEJST H10 .BJETS +69 325
>Josh: ACENRRS 15J NACRES +47 425
#note As you can see, before my turn, I am up by 53 points.
>Ross_Brown: ACEFIMT 13A FACETIM. +86 411

>Josh: AALLPRU 13C ALULA. +14 439
#note Nice try, Ross. 
>Ross_Brown: ACEFIMT 12L M.AT +31 356
#note N6 FEM is the only play that looks like it might win for Ross, cause I might block TUNICAE on column O with ACEINTUZ in the bag, and allow him to bingo out with ZINCATE(S) at 15A. But if I play PEWS at O5 he isn't going to win even with ZINCATE(S) so forget that thought
>Josh: ENPRRST F9 R. +2 441
#note Well, I forgot it PIKER was a word, but I am going for the 2/4 shot at SERPENT(S) 15A and REPENTS C2. I knew he had FICE so the pool was WEEZ. What could go wrong? There are no bingos in the pool, right?
>Ross_Brown: CEEEFIW 14A CEE +12 368
#note Right, there are no bingos in the pool. Don't worry, I didn't blow the game that hard! N1 CEE sets up two outs, but 14A FEE is better than everything, as it sets up WI(F)E which I cannot block, and that is more useful than setting up an out---
>Josh: ENPRSTZ 8M .P +4 445
#note An out which I didn't see. I knew he held WIFE. I thought he was setting up FI(C)E. This is probably the second worst play possible barring a phony. -47 to A11 SPE(C)T, which I saw but was unsure of. I thought my counter-setup was cute. Just a bit too cute, I guess.
>Ross_Brown: EFIW 15D WIFE. +15 383
