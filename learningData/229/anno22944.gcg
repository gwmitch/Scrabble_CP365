#note good start, quackle agrees, I'm happy. Jennifer and I have played once before, at llast year's NOLA. I won that one
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: INPT E7 P.INT +14 14
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST H1 SOLiTAR. +71 97
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST --  -71 26
#note OK, so this is a huge fuck up. There are SO MANY bingos I could have chosen. But I go for this one, and it promptly comes off the board. I suck
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: DEOTU D10 OUTED +16 30
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST J2 pATROLS +68 94
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST --  -68 26
#note Kill me now. Again, tons of good bingos and I choose a bad one. This is terrible.
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: ACERSYZ -  +0 30
#note exchange 4
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST H3 sOLAR.TS +58 84
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST --  -58 26
#note I really thought this one was good. Otherwise I would have played pATROLS hooking on top of the ER in FAINER. 3 challenged off in a row. I'm mentally damaged at this point. I belong in a loony bin. fuck me.
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: ABN C13 BAN +21 51
>Josh_Greenway: ?ALORST 7H pATROLS +62 88
#note finally. jesus I'm terrible. can't believe I'm ahead
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: IM B14 MI +22 73
>Josh_Greenway: AAGHHOU 8L HAHA +58 146
#note thank you jesus. I did not deserve this play
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: Z 15A Z.. +36 109
>Josh_Greenway: EGIORTU N2 ROUGI.. +26 172
#note I don't hate this play, and quackle likes it, but it carries a fair degree of risk. I hold my nose and hit the clock... OMG on second look I've misspelled it - its supposed to be ROGUI(SH). Jennifer accepts based on what's on her rack...
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: ENTX O1 NEXT +50 159
#note Boom! Man, I'm bad at this
>Josh_Greenway: EENNOOT 4M N.. +3 175
#note blocking the OX, I guess?
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: IQ M1 QI +14 173
>Josh_Greenway: BEENOOT 6H OBE +18 193
#note OK so after all that nonsense we're tied. I make this play and have a decent leave
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: AUV 5J VAU +18 191
>Josh_Greenway: AENORRT 9K NOR +14 207
#note just trying to stay ahead
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: CJKLORU -  +0 191
#note exchange 2
>Josh_Greenway: AEEILRT 5E LIER +11 218
#note OK, I miss ATELIER (which I think I should know but don't) and EL(UT)RIATE which I'll never know. Just trying to score points and pick up some high point tiles or any of SSS? still left
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: CJKLORU 11C J.. +10 201
>Josh_Greenway: AACEMTW 4D CAM +20 238
#note WAME is better, but I don't know WAME. This opens a couple of lines, which isn't great holding AETW
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: LY 10D ..LY +9 210
#note Jennifer clearly has something and is ready to pounce given her last couple of plays
>Josh_Greenway: AEEFSTW L2 WE +12 250
#note not great. trying not to open anything - in fact this shuts down one of the two lanes I opened last round
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: ?ACILOT 11G OpTICAL +71 281
#note nice find by Jennifer, putting her up by 32
>Josh_Greenway: AEFGIST J10 F.G +15 265
#note not horrible, love the leave = aeist
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: DEIP H11 .IPED +24 305
>Josh_Greenway: AEISTWY 12L YAW +30 295
#note I miss TI(D)EWAYS (remember: TIDEWAYS like SIDEWAYS!) and play YAW for 30, leaving IEST. Sure, I'm likely giving up some points here, but I'm closing the lead to 10 and leaving myself some bingo options
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: EGOS O12 SEGO +29 334
>Josh_Greenway: DEEIOST 13H .OSTED +42 337
#note Was happy with this find, which puts me within 11. I keep IE and draw the last tile in the bag, maybe I can go out next turn and make this happen!
>Jennifer_Dewaelsche: DEKRSUV C2 DUSK +26 360
#note Ouch!
>Josh_Greenway: EIR 2A RI.E +10 347
#note I can go out, and I know I get 12 points from Jennifer.  can pull out a close loss and go for the recount - sounds good to me! The score is 357-359... we do the recount and we find 2 points missed on my HAHA play - OMG we're tied! And then we find 1 point on her NEXT play. Damn. ends in a one point loss. 
>Josh_Greenway:  (EEV) +12 359
