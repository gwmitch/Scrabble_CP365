#note I knew I had a bingo through the T.  TRIDUUMs was the word I couldn't quite remember.  There's a few others, but I didn't look for bingos for very long.

#note Whoa, I scored this as 70.  I must've thought it hit the 2WS.

#note I considered quite a few plays here and I narrowed the choices down to INVADE, DIVA or VIAND.  I played VIAND because it's the most annoying of the three.  With INVADE, she can bingo on row 2.  With DIVA she can bingo to the A on column O.  With VIAND, she can't do jack.  However, I like VARIED best.  I missed it.

#note YAHOO!

#note I like this play.  It scores 41 points and she can longer play an easy ERs bingo on row 14.

#note I noticed CINE two turns later, but I'm glad I made the play that I did.  I try to be as annoying as possible when playing Jackie and taking out row 15 is along those lines.

#note I'm such a brat.  She can't bingo on column O now because it requires two S's.  It's unlikely she'll bingo to the N on row 4 so I'm pretty sure I'm about to shut her out.

#note She more than likely has the Q on her rack, so I can stick her with it!! And if the Q is the last tile in the bag, she'll just play there to block the only spot to dump the Q.  So I figure I'm really not hurting myself here.
