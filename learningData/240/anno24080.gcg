#note just blocking the X-bomb and the Z-bomb for later, although there is only one U left. Hmm. I considered all of the K5 plays as well. It isn't the worst thing if I cannot bingo next turn and draw two vowels, so I was fine with this. 
>Joe_Edley: ADEGMNR 11E MEG +29 88
>Joe_Edley: ADEGMNR --  -29 59
#note I challenged this very quickly, and Joe said "what are you challenging?". I will not be intimidated by Joe Edley! I said "they play, obviously..." :)

This was Joe's rack. I might have played this too, for lack of a decent option.

>Joe_Edley: ADEGMNR 4F GRAND.ME +76 135
>Joshua_Sokol: AEKLTVX H1 KAV. +33 205
#note KAV(A) keeping T(E)LEX or T(E)LEX keeping KAV(A)? My leave after KAVA seemed far more workable, even if Joe got down another bingo. Also, X(U) at E11 is a great block/fish if that needs to happen. I really didn't want to play TELEX, since Joe could just fork the board and score, leaving me with KAV and probably no good way to block.
>Joe_Edley: OOZ E5 ZOO +31 166
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNSTVX M3 V.X +26 231
#note Same thing with playing TELEX last turn. I just didn't like the worst case scenarios vs. the worst case scenarios after VEX. I played very conservatively in some cases this tournament, to my own surprise. I got very afraid of getting bad, all-consonant draws and letting my opponent exploit that with certain plays. In this case, I should really just go for TELEX, I think.

>Joshua_Sokol: AAAACDR L4 .AD +19 311
#note Looks good, blocks the top right completely. That was sort of my idea after VEX: Plays like MAD can just block the whole right side after, and they are easy plays to draw. 
>Joe_Edley: CT E11 C..T +12 232
>Joshua_Sokol: AAACEGR D14 AG +7 318
#note Joe's range is pretty scary. He could be holding Q??, which can propel him right back into the game if I fail to properly block his opening. This made me fear a play at H11. GA(T)ER or RE(T)AG (I didn't actually know RETAG, that looks alright) are problematic if Joe bingos from H15, or opens another lane at say 3A. All of these things are very unlikely, but it seemed AG avoided very many disasters from occurring. Joe could be holding anything, but he probably has a blank.

#note what a draw here. I finally talked myself into this, citing that I could never be able to make this word up. I could have just played 15L HAAR
>Joe_Edley: BO 8M .OB +15 291
>Joshua_Sokol: AIINOOO 13A AI. +3 403
#note Q in the bag, that's unfortunate. I almost didn't block here, but this stick looked good. B13 ON is scary, but looks like it wins by more here. 4, to be precise. With perfect play from Joe, that is. His next play is very cool.
