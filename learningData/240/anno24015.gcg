#note At first glance UH/UT for 11 looks ok but I actually can *only* bingo on this board with an L draw. None of the 8 bingos in AEGINRS actually bingo haha. I REALLY didn't want to turn this into a bingo-or-die game but I didn't see any scoring options. GUISE is that option. I should have played it, I think.
