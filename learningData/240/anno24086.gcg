#note This was a really silly play. I thought he had a bingo ready and so I wanted to set myself up for points. This is the kind of play I make when I'm exhausted and not thinking straight. I missed 5G F(A)CIAE and some other stuff. And I got rewarded.

#note Chris at this point asks me if his score is "TWO-NINETY-SIX?"
twice, which was hilarious by itself. But directly after he says it the second time, a Division 4 player a couple of tables behind us confirms the score as "Two-ninety-seven".

I couldn't stop laughing at the timing of that.
