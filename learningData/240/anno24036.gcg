#note Oops! Spaced out and missed BEAUT/QAT. Who needs 39 points when you can get zero.
>Marc_Booth: AAEIRTX 10F TAXI +27 33
#note Not seeing BEAUT for some reason. TAXI at 10H gets 7 more points.
>Doug_Critchlow: AEJNS J6 JANES +44 83
>Marc_Booth: ?AEFILR 4F FRIAbLE +78 111
#note Could've played it at 4B for 1 more point. Saw LeAFIER as well, but figured FRIaBLE more likely to draw a challenge.
>Doug_Critchlow: DDEELRY -  +0 83
#note He challenged FRIAble. 
>Marc_Booth: ?EMOTUV 3H OM +16 127
#note Saw OUTMOVE, but I wasn't sure and had a lead with the last blank so didn't risk it. It is good... and now I know.

>Marc_Booth: ?EFTTUV 12F FEU +17 144
>Marc_Booth: ?EFTTUV --  -17 127
#note TIFF is good, but not TIF.  It's better to remember the 3s than forget them when you're more focused on 5's and 7's.

>Marc_Booth: ?EFTTUV 9C V.U +10 137
#note Play bad and leads evaporate... POOF!
>Doug_Critchlow: EEZ 6J .EEZ +20 148
>Marc_Booth: ?EFLTTT N5 FELT +32 169
#note Note: GEEZ does not take this hook.

#note Because really, how often do you get to play this great word? Almost drew a challenge.

#note 15A gets an extra point and is better defensively. I was just happy to see. LESION+?: TUMOR? PAGE SKILFUL DOCTOR!
>Doug_Critchlow: AHIRS A11 HAIRS +38 272
#note Yeah, like I was saying... 15A prevents this move.
>Marc_Booth: DDENNNU N12 DUN. +18 436
#note I hadn't tracked properly and should've realized he's going out next play and gone with B3 DUNNED instead.
