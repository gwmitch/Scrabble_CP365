>Bernard_Gotlieb: ANTUV H4 VAUNT +24 24
>Joshua_Sokol: BGIMNOV 6G V.M +8 8
#note This is cute, but doesn't really score enough to justify itself, I would say. But it's quite defensive. OV(U)M is simming to the top. Everything else gives back so much more!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EEW 8E WEE. +7 31
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGINO 3B BEGONIA +81 89
#note lucky!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AAEELMS B1 AM.LE +18 49
#note Bernard missed A(B)EAM. He tends to be very polarized against me, once a paranoid defensement, once a daredevil attacker!
>Joshua_Sokol: ADILNUY 1A Y.UD +30 119
#note Could have taken more time to consider A1 YA for 4 more. But no, I don't need that U!
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AA 2F AA +10 59
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKLNO A4 ENOKI +35 154
#note no-go!

>Joshua_Sokol: ACJLOPT E6 CO.PAT +26 180
#note Regretted this route quickly, after minutes of debating whether or not it made sense to keep the J here. If I want to keep the J, I should play F5 POL(E)CAT, which I missed. Or even the defensive 7D CAPO(N), giving Bernard no easy scoring decisions. I didn't like the iffiness of JOL(E) F5 keeping ACPT, especially with the pool. I also didn't like the scoring options B8 TAJ gave back, but I should have played that anyway. Ugh, JL sucks! ;)
>Bernard_Gotlieb: EFO 2L FOE +19 158
>Joshua_Sokol: DEHJLNR 10B JEH.D +36 216
#note Could and should have given more thought to just H(A)J. Lots of I's to come, I hit a bingo fairly often, and when I don't, that's OK too. With LNR, not as much of the "OK, I didn't hit".
>Bernard_Gotlieb: BEFIRST C7 BRI.FEST +84 242
#note Not sure Bernard would have seen FIBSTER or had the guts to play FIBSTER/COWPATS if I hadn't give him a spot. :/
>Joshua_Sokol: LNOOPRR D12 LOOP +26 242
#note Missed 3M PRO, which is slightly less abysmal than this
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AQT 3J QAT +18 260
>Joshua_Sokol: IINRRSU 15D .URIN +21 263
#note Big break here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ACLT 14G TALC +16 276
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IINRSS 4J INS +33 296
#note Thought that it was useless to look for a bingo here. Missed RAISINS and saw RISINGS, was unsure of it, but figured this must be better anyway. I have the case S, and a blank. If Bernard manages a bingo after this, I will have a prime lane all to myself, unless he knows TALCY+. Him bingo-ing on column is unlikely, but even if he is, I'm usually in the lead after my own bingo, or I can fish.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DI 4D ID +15 291
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIRRSU K8 HURRIeS +75 371
#note wondered about cURRISH, thought it made little difference, and I was unsure. He probably would have challenged unsuccessfully. Meh
