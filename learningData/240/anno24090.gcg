>Mack: EEFKNOY 12F KEYNO.E +36 58
#note Clearly better than M1 KEEF or M2 KEF for the turnover, in my opinion. EONY isn't nearly a good enough leave to justify KEF.

#note Wanted to keep two consonants instead of three and preserve the KEYNOTE hooks, hence thos over 10J JOLE.

>Mack: ?AAFNUZ 10J Z.A +32 313
#note Now that I have no hooks to KEYNOTE (besides the blank), I elected to block it with DRSS unseen.
>Siri: ETV I6 VE.T +16 308
>Mack: ?AFNRSU G3 FURNA.eS +67 380
#note Saw UNSAFeR down the N column, missed SURFmAN. UNSAFeR is clearly wrong, not sure I would have played SURFmAN anyway despite the 10 extra points because of the A at N8.

>Siri: BELT H1 BLET +29 337
>Mack: DEEEETT 1H .EET +6 386
#note Need to be careful here - if the G is in the bag then Siri could bingo out with OUABAINS and win. I thus must do this or something similar to block.
