#note I think I prefer a wide-open board against Sherman. I don't know the man's game yet, though. Hmm. Maybe I should just play PLASTER and reduce variance.

#note I had had it here. I didn't even want to win this game, unless perchance I could get Joel to completely blow it. That's why I played this, to sort of freak him out a bit and overthink everything. Didn't work this time I don't think.
>Joel_Sherman: ORW 11I .ROW +21 204
#note Dunno his leave, but it's possible he sacrificed a lot to block the easy S lane and give me a weak one.

#note to BE or not to BE? BE leaves much better, but there are I's left to draw and I need points. But it leaves so much better. Humph. I was having fun watching this game, though.

#note For lack of a better option (VA(N)G) was just boring, I decided to try and exploit Joel a bit further. It didn't work this time either. 2K GANEV is nice though, actually. He might be out of vowels in which case I might pull ahead next turn. Although I hold WC.
