>Will_Anderson: EKQRTUW 8G WERT +14 14
#note W: Top static play but definitely wrong, too much downside risk. Exch KW needs to be the play here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AERTUUX J8 .UX +26 26
>Will_Anderson: EEIKOQU 9E OKE +14 28
#note W: And this needs to be WOK
>Joshua_Sokol: AEORTUV D7 OUTRAVE +80 106
>Will_Anderson: EIOQRSU 11B QU.I +26 54
#note W: Thought hard about RISQUE but my bingo chances are pretty good with QUAI.
>Joshua_Sokol: AACFILN F9 .ALIF +28 134
#note This was a phony setup!
>Will_Anderson: EEIORRS K10 IRE +15 69
#note W: Not trusting Josh to leave me open lines after ORE.

#note W: Between PHON and PAVE here...Q says PAVE is the better of the two, and that I can leave the lane open if I want to with a bunch of other plays. I think PAVE is better in part because it doesn't allow huge scoring plays in response along rown 14 that also open the triple lane. The H is also an interesting tile to keep because of EDH.

#note I was OK with this position. I can still win. I pull an E for JA(P)E, and threaten a bingo the next turn. 
>Will_Anderson: AACGILO N6 ALOGICA. +65 409
#note Will says "nope, doesn't make sense to me. I'll just bingo for the 4th time in 5 turns because you made a mistake"
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEGJNS A12 JA.E +63 311
#note This time, I can draw the Z to threaten a huge play, or a 2x2 next turn to stay within range. All is not lost.
>Will_Anderson: AENOTTZ 8L ZO.N +69 478
#note "Nope, you can't win, Josh. You aren't allowed to lose a turn when you are playing a top 5 player"

#note just give up and play ESTROGEN
