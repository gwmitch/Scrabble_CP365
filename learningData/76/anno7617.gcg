#note MISPOLL* isn't good, but PLIMSOL(!) sure is!  It takes an E and L, too!  This is pretty weak, but I just wasn't aware of anything better.  I didn't want to expend my S just yet, but I guess I should have.

#note Thought I'd get a challenge, but not evenhold.  DECANTS/SCANTED is a bit better, a bit less defensive.

#note Don't know what I'm doing here.  It's okay I guess.  No need to open the triple line when she's probably close, too.

#note Didn't want to empty the bag, but didn't see a choice.  ANTE was the best play I saw with those vowels.  Champ says ANTE wins 97.22%.  THE at N13 or M12 wins 100%.  NTH, 98%.
