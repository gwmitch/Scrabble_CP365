#note You're kidding me, there's a playable 7 in this rack?  I'll give you one hint:  there's a town in southwestern Virginia with this name.  Not knowing the bingo, this is the best non-bingo option.  I considered I10 ABACA (the sim bronze medalist) but thought it was too likely to be a situation where I play for 23, give back a guaranteed 35 (or much worse if she has the X), and I'm still addled with the W.  
>Judy_Newhouse: CEH 10E CHE. +26 54
>Jim_Burlant: AACIIIT -AIII +0 17
#note Quackle gives slight preference to keeping one of the I's; this choice is runner-up.  No matter how I slice it I'm winning a hair under 30%.
>Judy_Newhouse: EIOV E7 VOI.E +20 74
>Jim_Burlant: AACGSTX D11 ACT +12 29
#note Loath to part with my S, which really limited my options.  Q says I need to burn the S here, as all of its top options burn it for not even 20 pts.  Q does not like this play at all...and neither did I.   Sim winner is 12B TABS followed by 12E STAG.  
>Judy_Newhouse: DGILU I3 GUILD +18 92
>Jim_Burlant: AAGQRSX 4H Q.AGS +50 79
#note Good thing she floated the U.  This is clearly best, and the sim results make it clear that nothing else is even worth consideration.
>Judy_Newhouse: INOR K4 .IRON +12 104
>Jim_Burlant: AGIMRUX C9 GUM +13 92
#note  I figured that unless she had JORAM, or a bingo ending in AM/AN in her rack, she probably wasn't going to play in the B column and I could do much more damage at B10 than she could, so it was worth the risk.   I was  annoyed at having unloaded the Q and drawn a U on the replenish for the second straight game; as a result I didn't even look for plays that didn't unload the U.  MATRIX 13B wins the sim; though this play doesn't even show up on the Quackle kibitzer's rader, it is the runner up, though at a hefty equity loss to MATRIX.    But this did work nicely.
>Judy_Newhouse: AAPP 8K .APPA +30 134
>Jim_Burlant: AIINORX B9 AX +53 145
#note Hmmm.  Quackle says E5 INVOICE is best, with this choice a one-point runner up.  Regardless, now that I've waded through the dreck, I start drawing exceedingly well and my winning chances (currently 35%) are about to soar.
>Judy_Newhouse: ORTY A6 TROY +28 162
>Jim_Burlant: IINORST 13B IN.ROITS +70 215
#note Or CROSTINI 12D, which wins the sim by 1 point.  This wins 72%.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?AAEINR N5 AIR.lANE +63 225
#note Other bingos for Judy include ANtIRAPE, which scores 72.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEKNRR L7 D.RKENER +79 294
#note The only playable bingo and it wins 82%.
>Judy_Newhouse: DEFO O12 FEOD +45 270
>Jim_Burlant: LLNSUWY 15H NULLS +33 327
#note Best, nothing else sims within 5 points.
>Judy_Newhouse: JO N14 JO +39 309
#note It's not exactly like Judy is drawing horribly here; she has literally put up 205 points in her last 5 turns (including this).  But there is just no defense for her against my hitting the 53-point X bomb and following that up with consecutive bingos, and using the second blank for 56 and having an off rack that "only" scores 33 points during that same stretch.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EHUVWY O1 cHEVY +56 383
#note Best plays per Q are  K11 YEW or HEW for 35. But the sim results also indicate that burning the blank isn't bad here.   This play sims within 4 points of ViEWY and within 2 points of HEW for sim winner honors.    I only saw WaVEY and this; ViEWY, which I couldn't think of, was definitely better.  I'm winning 91.5%, and ViEWY wins 93.5.  YEW, and HEW win 94.
>Judy_Newhouse: FI M12 IF +27 336
#note Urp - upside-down board dyslexia strikes again.  I saw NEIF and didn't realize until too late that she'd transposed her letters to make NIEF*.
>Jim_Burlant: AIMOSUW N2 OW +25 408
#note Quackle prefers UM in this location by a handful of points.   Given all the unseen E's in the pool this does make sense as I'm almost certain to draw one on my ensuing turn.
>Judy_Newhouse: EN M2 NE +22 358
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOSU B2 SUAMI +22 430
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOSU --  -22 408
#note Word confusion strikes again - SWAMI is the word.  SUOMI is the name of Finland; I have no idea why I thought this was good.  Yuck.  (O)E  F13 would have been much better, as it guarantees an out with MIAOUS at either 15A or 5B.  Nothing like brain farting away 28 points of spread.

#note MIAOUS 5B!
