#note i realy should see amrita. i strongly considered 3E RAW but i don't like taking chances like that against low-rated players. it doesn't feel right. yes, i'm talking about ZA. AWAIT is also a lot better than my move and something i really should have spotted. DRAW isn't a very good play. -5.5

#note it's important to find things like MURA 13I in this situation. very important. -5

#note i missed ANOTHER 9! this one i didn't know. i shoulda seen reincite though, but it's not a million times better than my play. i should be expecting to win this game after the fortunate blank draw. -22

#note i spotted ALANE at 14F and i did this on purpose. i was still trying to get another bingo and win as much as i could so i could play doug or kevin next round and i thought i could luck into something. doh. -15

#note same story as before. O5 GENTEEL should be the play, but i am being stupid. -7.5

#note this is the worst play i've ever made, in any game of scrabble, ever. basically, pretty much anything that makes any sense wins this game. E3 HID (going for reteaming, even!), 3F HEN, 1F GAM, 2G PIG, etc etc etc. i was right to block SOMETHING (SALPINGES is the only way he can win, i didn't see it, but i thought he may have something trivial). i thought of pinger, but i wasn't 100% sure, and i didn't want to give up spread by having him score to the right in row 1.... little did i know. and for the record, i saw aping, but i could not fathom him scoring a million points off of it.

#note he found the only win. it's sick.
>Me: EEGHIR 11E .EH +14 417
#note i may have been able to draw a challenge on reheel, but i didn't think of it before i ran out of time, and it loses anyway.
