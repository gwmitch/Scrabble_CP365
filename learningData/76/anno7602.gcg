#note If I'm going to do this, Q says to throw the D in too.  Nothing else seemed too appealing.

#note Taking out the Q spot, which, in hindsight, was a big mistake.

#note So: I've gotta block the X spot and leave 1 in the bag because there's no way I can block all the bingo lines with that great looking pool.  SUQ is out 'cause that just surrenders.  That's why I chose AG.  Dave suggested maybe I shouldn't have given him another chance to fish.  So, (T)OG?  Champ says S(U)QS.  I don't see what difference that makes.  Makes the bingo score less?  If he has one, he has NAILSET on column A, or anything on C.

#note The A was in the bag.
>Ryan_Fischer: CCEOQSS 10B SECCO +17 377
#note CUSECS is Champ's recommendation, though it loses.  I didn't remember it.  I chose SECCO to block and obstruct what lanes I could and hope maybe he wouldn't find the underlap.
