>Ryan_Fischer: AEORTTU F4 OUTRATE +67 67
#note Yeah, I shoulda figured the parallel play would be better.  Lazy!

#note 12I FERN 22.  If this, then F(I)RN G10.
>Mandy_Hollman: CLL 5E C.LL +12 123
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EMNORT J2 MENTORs +72 173
#note D2 MONsTER 74.  Maybe.  The differences are so minimal here.
>Mandy_Hollman: DZ 14A .DZ +26 149
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEHHI 15C AHI +21 194
#note Weak, but I had my reasons.  Didn't want to play up top to close it, passed up RAZE, get rid of ONE H, save one for scoring next turn too.  I3 HAE 29 forming CULLET did that a bit better, except for the closing thing.
>Mandy_Hollman: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 149
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEHJNP 10B JEE +29 223
#note Saw JAPE, wasn't wild about it.  JEE sets up my A, though there's others left.  Not that risky considering where it is.
>Mandy_Hollman: IQ 14E QI +24 173
>Ryan_Fischer: AHKLNPV 3I P.KAN +28 251
#note 3I V(E)NAL 24 is a bit better (Q really hates Vs!).
>Mandy_Hollman: BDNO 4L BOND +28 201
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHILOV O1 VOI. +24 275
#note She told me she had a 3x3 through D, so I'm glad I took this spot out instead of settling for V(O/I)LA.

#note C(AN)OEIsTS!  And (E)SOTErIC, which she'll find next turn.  I didn't think to block at this point.  Small oops.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGGTYY 9M G.Y +9 415
#note Totally missed the OXY hook.  Oops.  This was just weak.  I had figured out the contents of the bag and everything, too!  I think this was just meant to block ErOTICS.  I didn't look to the E until later.  That, or didn't know if she'd get it.
>Mandy_Hollman: ?CEIOST 15H .SOTErIC +80 332
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGIRTY 14J YID +33 448
#note Yeah, this didn't lead to an out in two.  According to Q, L11 RIDG(E) does.  Oops.
