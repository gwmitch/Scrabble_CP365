>Baudekin: ILOY 8E OILY +14 14
>Sneaky: EINOORU D6 OURIE +15 15
#note OURIE or bust.  Ducky prefers the former.
>Baudekin: AHIRY C9 HAIRY +41 55
>Sneaky: ACNNOVZ 6B ZO.N +33 48
#note Sim says ZONA b6 is tops with ZOON and the suicidal f6 ZO(I)C a touch behind.  An interesting choice is V(I)NCA f7 which may or may not set up the Z next turn.
>Baudekin: IPR E3 PIR. +12 67
>Sneaky: ACINOVV 4D V.NIC +26 74
#note V(I)VA - with its awesome CINO leave - is the #1 selection.  AV(I)ONIC on the same line for 6 more comes in second.  VINIC, well, not as good.
>Baudekin: EIMNRSU 12A MU.RINES +78 145
#note MURRINE (adj.) - of or pertaining to a word whose phony plural you didn't challenge the last time it was played against you
>Sneaky: AAGLOUV A8 ALGU. +24 98
>Baudekin: OPW 11E POW +31 176
>Sneaky: ACEGNOV 10F CAVE +32 130
>Baudekin: AERSTTU J5 STATURE +73 249
#note Dude, you're not supposed to do that.
>Sneaky: ?EGINOS 13G SIGNOrE +80 210
#note Nice idea, but cOGNI(Z)ES/aGONI(Z)ES scores 6 more.
>Baudekin: EEK I5 EEK +27 276
>Sneaky: DDEEMNQ G3 Q. +21 231
#note Sweet find, Sneaky.  Now maybe I can get lucky and draw an A.
>Baudekin: TTX 11I T.XT +24 300
#note YGBFKM.  Now? Really?!
>Sneaky: ADDEEMN 7B AM. +26 257
#note Still seething after he blocked my 8, I was ready to rip the table from the ground.  That is until I calmed down and realized the table was not actually bolted.
>Baudekin: ADEFGNS M5 DEFANGS +79 379
#note Ouch.  Now I have to draw the blank and hope my opponent falls asleep in order to stay within the 62-point zone.  C'mon, that's not totally unrealistic.
>Sneaky: DDDEELN N2 DELED +32 289
#note Maybe should've gone with ENDED in the same spot.  Also 32, opens two lines.  The win % is pretty much zero either way, but remember I'm looking to lose by less than a certain amount.
>Baudekin: AEHLO O6 HAOLE +31 410
>Sneaky: BDFIJNW M1 JIB +35 324
#note Duckers slots DIF (also m1) the best winning % (at around 1) since it gives me the shot at drawing to JAWBONE(D).  Silly quacker.
>Baudekin: OORT L2 ROTO +21 431
#note Yup, that'll do it.
>Sneaky: ?BDFINW H12 ..B +5 329
#note So I grab the blank, which *really* helps at this point.  (Note to blank statisticians: I won Games 5 and 6 without any blanks and I lost this one with both.  Those 0-pointers will only help if you can work with decent tiles and favourable board position.  And a shitload of luck doesn't hurt.)
>Baudekin: AAET I13 .AT +8 439
#note As expected.  Even if I somehow land WINDs/FINDs (51), I don't think I can make up the difference.  Waitress, can I order a tall glass of chloroform?
>Sneaky: ?DFINW 15F WIs. +33 362
#note Too fixated on that spot to see h1 FlI(C) for 2 more.  Like it matters.
>Baudekin: AE K6 AE +12 451
#note And we have a new champion.  Congrats, JuJu!
>Baudekin:  (DFN) +14 465
