#note Ugh--draw complete blank on this one. I must not have written this one on my chest.

>Verna_Richards_Berg: IKQU 10B QUI.K +48 118
#note Ouch. I smell the luckbagging coming.
>Winter: EEFGHOT C8 FO.GHT +28 163
>Verna_Richards_Berg: AENOPTU 15H AUTOPEN. +89 207
#note Yeah, here it comes.
>Winter: EEEEIOZ B6 ZEE +37 200
>Verna_Richards_Berg: EY 14M YE. +21 228
#note She misses the hook I'd been hoping for.
>Winter: AEEIJLO 13J AJEE +34 234
#note Didn't want to give up both Es with so few left, but I could smell vowelities abounding.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: ?EIMNNS M3 MeNIN.ES +74 302
>Winter: AIILMOU D12 MOIL +30 264
#note Damn, saw MIAOU but didn't consider opening up the board like that.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: GINPRRS 4G SPRING.R +76 378
#note Yeah, I should have smelled the luckbaggery coming and taken out the easy E line.
>Winter: ADEILUV A7 AD +32 296
#note Now my strategy is to slow the game down and hope she makes a mistake and that I get a lucky break, like that final S and an unblockable setup.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: LOO 5E LOO +8 386
#note Exactly--I expect her to play superdefensive and give up points, perhaps letting me get within bingo range.
>Winter: AEILOUV C3 UVEA +25 321
#note Only real hope now is a chance to set something up to the P and then to bingo. Q likes there is no chance that Verna doesn't block, even for just a couple of points.

>Winter: CIILNOR H2 LI. +5 326
#note Don't see any other way to win.
