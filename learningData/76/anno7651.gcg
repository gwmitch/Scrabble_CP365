#note Best.  Nothing else within 5 points in the sim.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ISV 4C VIS +23 71
#note Play incorrectly scored as 22.
>Jim_Burlant: ADFLNUY 7G YAUD +25 65
#note I felt that, since Sam had burned his S for only 23, he was probably sitting on another one.  Sims are run against an inferred S until further notice.  F2 FLAY wins the sim; this play takes a beating.  I realize it opens the K column for 2x2's, but really is this that much more dangerous than the SOFTENER hook?  I can understand taking a 5-point hit...but 12?  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EOQTU J2 QUOTE. +38 109
>Jim_Burlant: FGIKLNU 3H FL.KING +32 97
#note Sim says D1 KUFI (a word I've now missed three times this tournament) wins the win percentage battle though this play sims with highest valuation.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEELM F10 MELEE +27 136
>Jim_Burlant: EHINRSU 5H RU.H +14 111
#note  K3 KHI is the sim winner. Quackle likes N1 HUG or N2 UGH sim much much better than this, but I saw them and passed on them - I didn't like playing for 14 and giving 30+ back given that i was already in the hole.  This only scores 14 and I don't like turning the R, but didn't see much else and was too fixated on unloading the U.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AAS C3 A.A +12 148
>Jim_Burlant: EILNORS 13F .LOINERS +70 181
#note Concerned about the S hook he's set up on row 15, but I felt that, since nothing I could put down wasn't fraught with pitfalls, maximize the points.  Against an inferred AIDS, this sims best at 54%.  I was also convinced my lead was going to be very short-lived given his last play.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADIOSU 15A AUDIOS +32 180
#note Now that Sam has played his second S, sims are being run against random racks.
>Jim_Burlant: AHIINNR D10 HIN +23 204
#note Apparently I was supposed to take the points with H12 HORA and H12 HORN, but this play sims very close to them.  I'll trade 10 pts for AINR over AIIN or IINN, especially with TTTTEEEE still unseen.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AX 14A AX +38 218
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRWY H12 Y.WE +42 246
#note Best, nothing else within 5 points in the sim.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEOT C11 DOTE. +31 249
#note When I saw this come down I wondered - while those 31 points are awfully hard to stay away from, with only 2 E's remaining in the bag, it begs the question:  if it's the only E in his rack, would it be worthwhile for him to keep it, and not play it for anything under 40 points or some other game-deciding/saving play, even if he has to sacrifice 10 pts or thereabouts on the scoreboard to do so?
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACIINR H1 RI. +18 264
#note Whiffed on a bunch of bingos:  N3 GRANITIC, M3 NIRVANIC, M6 mINICARS, and NARCISSI with 2 different placements of the blank.   The winner is GRANITIC N3 68, and the rest of the bingos only score 60 or 61.  This choice, which Quackle says is the best non-bingo option, gives up not quite 20 equity to GRANITIC and not quite 10 pts to NARCISSI.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BGI L12 B.IG +18 267
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACINOP 1A CAPONIe. +86 350
#note Best bingo; m6 CANOPIES is the other one.  Math error here - play scored as 86 but only added 76 on my scorecard.  Neither of us caught the error.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BCR L1 CR.B +22 289
>Jim_Burlant: ?AILNSZ N3 .LAZINgS +89 439
#note Luckbox!  This is obviously best; other options are M7 LAZINESS  and N2 AGNIZe. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AGV 8L VA.G +36 325
>Jim_Burlant: AEMOORT 1L .OMA +24 463
#note When it rains, it pours; yet another bingo rack, though this one doesn't play.  While it didn't really matter per se, I probably should have reversed the sequence by playing TORE 9G first, guaranteeing MOA 10J or COMA 1L.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EPTT F5 PE +17 342
>Jim_Burlant: EORT 9G TORE +17 480
#note Final score recorded as 474 - 341.
