#note At the end of day 1, I was 4 - 3.  I knew going into day 2 that if I split 3 of 6 I would crack a 1600 rating.  This was the 4th game of day 2.  My previous three, to say the least, had gone horrendously; the closest game was a 128-point loss to Paul Holser in the second of those three.  This was the first game after the lunch break and I was hoping to right the ship and still win out so I could salvage the 1600.  With that in mind...

#note Best bingo for Stan is MALEFIc, either at 7H or 9H for 70.  And, in light of the horrific morning,  watching Stan draw a blank bingo on his opening rack was not at all what I needed.
>Jim_Burlant: AHLMNPT 5I .MPLANT +22 46
#note Poor - given how the previous 3 games had gone, it didn't help that Stan drew a blank bingo on his opening rack.  Between being rattled by his hot start and the consonant ovelroaded rack, this poor play was all I could come up with.  J3 MATH is much, much, better.
>Stan_Miranda: CDEI O1 EDIC. +33 96
>Jim_Burlant: EEHINOX N1 HEX +46 92
#note Best; nothing else sims within 5 points.  Despite missing MATH on turn 2 I'm gradually crawling back into this and feeling like I'm still in the game.  And, while he's got the edge for sure, I'm still very much in this game.  But I'm about to make a succession of rapid-fire mistakes that turn this into an easy win for him.
>Stan_Miranda: IJO 3G JI.O +19 115
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKNOU 1E KENA. +36 128
#note Mistake.   KUFI 1G is obviously the star play here.   Looking at my scoresheet immediately after the game, I realized this.  But, for whatever reason, I missed that word three different times this tournament.  But I was just getting warmed up...
>Stan_Miranda: ADINRSU G8 .UINDARS +70 185
#note And mistake number 2.  At the time it didn't occur to me this was bad - only after the game, when I noticed the KUFI miss and saw this, did I realize I'd been had.  
>Jim_Burlant: ?BINOOU 15E BO.UN +21 149
#note Another mistake.  First, I'd have never found  L1 BOUILION.  But there were still much better plays than this; the most likely one I would have found would have been BOO F10, which would have prevented his next play.  And going further back - if I'm smart enough to challenge his play off the board, he probably comes back with (Q)UID or DURIAN/UNSAID 2A and it's still a close game with me sitting on the blank. And if I play KUFI instead of KENAF, I'm sitting on AEN? and 2 of BNO (the blank was one of the first 2 tiles out of the bag).  Instead I make another poor play and this is the game.
>Stan_Miranda: DEEHNOR 12G .EHORNED +78 263
#note Now I'm more than a little flustered - Stan is the third straight opponent to follow up a bingo with another bingo he's drawn right out of the bag.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILOOR 14I ORIOLEs +68 217
#note Best bingo, and I'm at 11% winning chances.  Other options include N8 BLOODIER, L2 and L1 WOOLLIER.
>Stan_Miranda: AUW L2 WAU. +14 277
#note False hope - I thought that just maybe, Stan's racks were finally cooling off.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGITYZ 6H G.Y +30 247
#note Best, crawling back into the game and I'm now winning 20%.  Maybe his racks will slow down and I can come back?
>Stan_Miranda: ENORSTU 10C ROUT.NES +62 339
#note Best bingo for Stan, and he's now winning 95%.  His next play will make that 100.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIOTZ 2B ZOEA +32 279
#note Best, and I'm theoretically still alive, at a hair over 3%.
>Stan_Miranda: AFIRY 3A FAIRY +49 388
#note Play scored as 58 (I didn't catch this) but it didn't matter - this game was now officially over.
>Jim_Burlant: ABIOTTW 15L WOT +23 302
#note D6 TOWBOAT wins at 0.63%.  This play is third at 0.4.
>Stan_Miranda: CGLS D8 CL.GS +22 410
>Jim_Burlant: ABIRSTV M9 VIB. +13 315
#note As good as anything else.
>Stan_Miranda: DEEGIPV A3 .IG +8 418
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRSTT 8A ETI. +18 333
#note Appropriate end rack for a game like this, considering that it doesn't play.  After FAIRY came down I stopped tracking and didn't care; after 4 straight games of this I just wanted to end it as quickly as possible.  Not realizing I was giving him an out play I put this down to end this as quickly as possible.  Any of a number of sixes at 6A are the obvious plays here.
>Stan_Miranda: DEEPV A7 P.EVED +14 432
>Stan_Miranda:  (ARST) +8 440
#note Final score recorded as 452 - 333.  The closest game I had in my first four games on day 2.
