#note KNIFER is good.  Q wants ORGEAT 14B 31.  This doesn't even rank.  Crazy.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGSTU 12I .UTAGE +14 79
#note 15F AUG(I)ITE 21.  I'm missing left and right here.  Thought this was clever, what with the good leave and S in tow and him drawing 7.

#note Bad.  Q wants F4 TEPI(D) 25; why open when he fished?  Dumping the E is its next option.

#note I noted after the game he blocked CHISELER.  I asked him if there were any 7s.  He said no.  I guess he didn't have the heart to tell me the 8 I missed.  :)  4A SCHLIER(E) (its anagram) 78.  Of note: 14A HER(O)IC 47.  This was decent, but those extra 22 points WERE the ballgame.
