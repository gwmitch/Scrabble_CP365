>Winter: ADGHIIO 8G GADI +12 12
>Evans_Clinchy: DENNNRY J7 N.NNY +10 10
#note Sims best. Decently strong defensively when compared to something like NERDY K5 that opens easier counterplays.
>Winter: ?CEHINO 9B HElICON +69 81
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEGNRS E4 ENERG.DS +90 100
>Winter: BELQSTW 8A WEB +33 114
>Evans_Clinchy: AADELLT K11 AL +14 114
#note Sims best. If I'm gonna fish, I'm gonna do so in a way that opens more bingo lanes (especially against Winter, who I expect to get uber-defensive in this spot).
>Winter: LNOQSTU 4A QUOT. +48 162
>Evans_Clinchy: AADELST F3 AD +19 133
#note Quackle says to quit being so fishy and play DAL F4 for nine extra points. This sims 2-3 points back.
>Winter: AALNOSU 7G ANO. +18 180
>Evans_Clinchy: AEELRST 13G RELATES +71 204
#note I probably should have put a little more thought into which bingo offers the least counterplay. REALEST 2A is best. This is pretty bad.
>Winter: AAJLSUY 14H LAY +31 211
>Evans_Clinchy: EHMORTV 15D THERM +48 252
#note Eh, just HELM is better. OVERT is a solid leave with a couple of nice lanes to cash it in.
>Winter: AEEFJSU 14E EF +31 242
>Evans_Clinchy: EGORRUV 2A VOGUER +30 282
>Winter: AEJPSSU 13B JAUP +34 276
>Evans_Clinchy: IIOORUX 14B OX +45 327
#note Two other plays sim better -- ROUX 1E, which takes out an important lane for 40, and OURIE L9, which cleans up the rack and sets up a second spot for OX to guarantee big points next turn.
>Winter: ACEIKSS L11 KA. +28 304
>Evans_Clinchy: DIIORUW 15A OW +28 355
#note Quackle really wants me to take out line 1 now. WORD 1E sims best despite keeping IIU.
>Winter: CEIISST 1F TIC +20 324
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DIIPRU H1 .UPID +11 366
#note Eww, what a weird rack. I spent a while looking for something better, but this is bizarrely best.
>Winter: AEEFISS 5C FI.E +20 344
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IIMRRV -IIRV +0 366
#note Thought about trying to play through this, but there are just so many goodies in the bag that trading is better. This sims best.
>Winter: ABEIOSS M5 ABIOSES +72 416
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IMORTZ 8L Z.OM +75 441
#note Oops, messed up the endgame sequence. ZORI is better.
>Winter: EIILRTV N1 VIRILE +30 446
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IRT 5J TRI..s +10 451
#note I was too low on my TI(M)eR to find the better outplay.
