>Sneaky: DEEKPSW K8 W.EK +22 46

>Cough,_Man: GLOY O6 LOG.Y +30 102
>Sneaky: DDELNPS M7 SP.NDLED +76 122
#note Safer than its anagram.  He held but didn't challenge.
>Cough,_Man: AZ 14L A.Z +26 128
#note He took a few minutes before he laid this down.  Maybe it's the sign of a very good leave.  Or perhaps ADZ is the best option (at least Senor Qwak agrees).
>Sneaky: ?AAINOO G4 ANOO.sIA +60 182
#note Beats exchanging or throwing your rack in anger and it accidentally hitting the waitress and knocking her unconscious.

>Cough,_Man: ACFLO 1K FOCAL +38 299
>Sneaky: ADDEFTU F4 FUD +29 371

>Cough,_Man: CEINRSV C11 V.CES +20 392
