#note Best.

>Ryan_Fischer: ACEINPS H5 CAN.PIES +63 63
#note INSCAPE *is* good!  I shouldn't have doubted myself, but against Looby, it's hard.  He remarked "I guess pass was best then" after I played CANOPIES, implying he didn't see the 7, and then I thought I was just making up INSCAPE.  Oh well.  Or maybe he thought I didn't see it.
>John_Luebkemann: EIOV 5E VOI.E +20 38
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFLOTY 10D FOET.DLY +69 132
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFLOTY --  -69 63
#note This one really bugs me.  FETID.  FETIDLY.  FOETID.  FOETIDLY#.  What SENSE does that make?!  Our dictionary sucks.
>John_Luebkemann: ADZ J4 ADZ +45 83
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFLOTY 4I F.TLY +27 90
#note G8 (W)OLFED 30 is still there.
>John_Luebkemann: OO 7G O.O +17 100
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEIOOT 12B DOODIE. +18 108
#note (Z)OOID is dumb.  At least I got this right.
>John_Luebkemann: AHRY B10 HY.RA +40 140
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEITT 15A CETE +34 142
#note Best.  Of note, TECTA.
>John_Luebkemann: AEOQRTU A6 QUOTA +47 187
#note He told me I blocked EQUATOR.  Wanted to hold me on CETE, but I had already drawn tiles.  Oops.  Damn badgers.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAGILT 11D GALA.A +27 169
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAGILT --  -27 142
#note Ugly.  And I got greedy, and transposed two letters in the proper 4v6.
>John_Luebkemann: EEGK E10 KE.GE +22 209
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAGILT M2 GA.AL +18 160
#note I can't believe this is so far down.  3M AGA keeping AILT is the winner.  I guess, it's nice to slow it down a bit.  Both blanks out though, and a game I started out with a lead in is slipping away.
>John_Luebkemann: HM F14 HM +28 237
>Ryan_Fischer: ABITTTX 15F .IXT +39 199
#note This sure helped.
>John_Luebkemann: EEINRSU 9H .ENURIES +69 306
>Ryan_Fischer: AAABNTT 8M ABA +27 226
#note Really didn't want to close down the lane.  There are till 4 or 5, though.
>John_Luebkemann: JSU 2K JU.S +24 330
>Ryan_Fischer: AENNSTT C4 TENANTS +65 291
#note This was a hard find for me, so quite satisfying.  TANNEST, too!
>John_Luebkemann: ORU 14H OUR +16 346
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINNRR B2 REIN +12 303
#note Saw RENIN, but I just had to open up another lane.
>John_Luebkemann: FIL J11 FLI. +7 353
#note Told me he got the blank after this play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIMNPR A1 pERP +36 339
#note I'm sunk.  Q suggests a P(I) fish, but with only one real lane (no hope for 9s or miracle sidelaps on column K), I'm just taking the points.
>John_Luebkemann: ?BGILRV D1 VIGs +32 385
#note L8 B(R)aVI 35.
>Ryan_Fischer: DIMN F9 MID. +20 359
#note Best.
>John_Luebkemann: BLR F4 R.B +11 396
#note B(I)RL to go out.
