#note Really wanted to play ZL(O)TY but ALT is better than AOT...
>nat: NU 14M UN +8 130
#note don't know what you had, but it looks like you were dumping Us this and last turn. Don't be afraid to hang on to one while the Q is unseen. Whenever I play a UU word I always seem to immediately draw the Q.

#note more I's, argh!!!
>nat: AE N1 AE +18 310

>me: EEINOTU F3 TEEN +8 384
#note This was risky; I was hoping it would make it harder to bingo since you would have to go through an E or N. LO takes too many common bingo letters as hooks.
