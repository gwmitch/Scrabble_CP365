>Matt_: EEIIJNR 8G JIN +20 20
>Charles: BGNOO J6 BONGO +27 27
>Matt_: DEEIRST K2 DIETERS +84 104
#note Fortunate draw to say the least.  Best of many bingoes.
>Charles: ?AEGRTT 11D TARGETs +72 99
#note Charles successfully talked himself out of GRATTED*/DJINNS.  GRAT doesn't take an S, it's an old English past form of GREET (along with GRUTTEN).
>Matt_: FILLMVY 3G VILL.FY +42 146
#note Bogus; only takes one L.  FILMILY, which I also saw, is the best legit play.
>Charles: HPZ H1 PH.Z +84 183
#note Ouch.
>Matt_: ADDKMST F6 MAD +26 172
#note I saw DEMAST as well. My thought process on MAD was that if I had to keep the K, might as well keep the S with it, and take out the JINNS hook. 
>Charles: INOW 12A WINO +26 209
#note Charles opens yet another 3x3 lane, after getting 3x3'd the previous 2 games that night (and winning both!).
>Matt_: DKQSTUY B10 QU.DS +70 242
#note The dangling I bails out this junk.  Very lucky.
>Charles: EEEHMOX 12G OX +37 246
>Matt_: IIKNSTY C9 KI +22 264
#note I debated between this and TINY; Quackle says to take the latter or EXITS/EXIST, but I find that Charles tends to grab Q hotspots ASAP, plus maybe I grab an O for NOSY. 
>Charles: ARU A12 .AUR +26 272
>Matt_: ILNSTUY H10 S..ILY +48 312
#note Happy to find this; not so happy I whiffed on EXULT, which sims at a virtual tie.
>Charles: AER L3 .RAE +25 297
>Matt_: BILNTUW 13D TWIB.L +27 339
#note I thought this play was good board vision on my part.  Quackle prefers UNWIT M5.
>Charles: CEEEEIT 2H .EE. +16 313
#note The march of the E's befalls Charles' racks.  
>Matt_: DHNNORU E5 HUN +18 357
#note Wasn't sure what to do with this rack, but this does as well as the other choices.  Wanted to unload the U with 1 still in the bag.
>Charles: ?CEEEIT 9B E.E +23 336
#note The only 7 is EvICTEE, which doesn't play.  EKE is probably what he should have done last turn, but the march of the E's made it moot.
>Matt_: ADENORU M6 RONDEAU +67 424
#note Disappointed I couldn't use the D(EKE) hook just created, but a bingo in the easiest bingo lane is the way to go.
>Charles: ?CEIPST A7 CEP +31 367
#note Quackle suggests EPICS 4A for Charles, opening up another lane with a pretty juicy bag to draw from.
>Matt_: AAEGIOR D3 AGORA +25 449
#note Happy with this play, but were I psychic I'd pick LAOGAI.
>Charles: ?EFIOST N9 OF +29 396
#note Charles whiffed on the two bingoes here.  When he showed me his rack I immediately saw LOFTIESt, which would have given me just a 1 point win when we played it out from there (COMATE O10 33, followed by TAN C3 19).  14F FOLIaTES is crazy, but it actually loses by more because i have 15L MICA 42 as a comeback.
>Matt_: ACEIMOV O3 VOMICAE +99 548
#note Instead I'm able to pounce on his newly created bingo lane. Very fortunate for me.
>Charles: ?AEINST -  +0 396
#note Lost desperation challenge.  YEASTINg cuts down on spread quite a bit.
>Matt_: T F13 .T +4 552
#note (OF)T 8 N9 instead.
>Matt_:  (?AEINST) +12 564
