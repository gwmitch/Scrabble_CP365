>Jim_Burlant: AEIJOPV 8G JIVE +28 28
#note 8E placement wins by nearly 4 points.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IMTX 7J MIXT +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: ABEFMOP 8M AMP +23 51
#note Saw 6k BEAM and this.  Too bad I couldn't think of 6I BEMA, which is best.  In the absence of this I didn't like giving easy S back-hooks down the O column while I was still saddled with this dreck.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EQRU K5 QU.RE +43 61
>Jim_Burlant: BEFLNOS 9G OF +21 72
#note Missing LOBEFINS.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CLLOY 10C COLLY +25 86
>Jim_Burlant: ABEELNS 4E ENABLES +77 149
#note At least I got one play right!
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DIPR 10K DRIP +30 116
>Jim_Burlant: DEILOOT O10 TOOLED +32 181
#note H1 DIOBOL is the sim winner; this and TOLEDO O10 sim interchangeably for runner up honors.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ANOTY 5D ATONY +31 147
>Jim_Burlant: EIINOWW 3C WIN +15 196
#note Uhhh...yuck.  14J WIENIE is much better.   Had planned on playing WINO 5C to set up the second W, but ATONY nuked that and I couldn't break out of the tunnel vision from the previous setup.  This is a waiting play to set up the other W for the second turn.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AHINV 14J VAHIN. +40 187
>Jim_Burlant: EHIORRW 6F WE +30 226
#note Not knowing the front hook to SQUIRED (didn't know ESQUIRE was a verb) limited me  quite a bit and I was fixated on unloading the W.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DE 3C ...ED +25 212
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DE --  -25 187
#note And Sam is up to his old tricks again.
>Jim_Burlant: DHIORRS C8 OR.HID +26 252
#note Best.  C9 ICHOR also worth consideration.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGO 3K EGO +26 213
>Jim_Burlant: AABERRS -  +0 252
#note And now I return the favor from 2 turns ago by losing a turn challenging this.

>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DEGI E9 G.IDE +14 227
>Jim_Burlant: AABERRS 3G BA +24 276
#note Quackle prefers that I unload the S and the R with BASER for 35.  I thought I could get cute and bingo there.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEZ 6B ZEE +34 261
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAERRS O6 RA. +5 281
#note There are no playable bingos here.   Quackle says I should play RAH L12...but I didn't think the pionts were the problem.  I felt that if Sam beat me to row 14, this would kill any chance I had at the game so I sacrificed points to keep the board alive.  This was the only rack balancer I could find that dind't take away any lucrative lines or give him an easy shot at shutting down row 14.  The sim docks me a bunch of equity here but I still win 82%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GIT 15K GIT +16 277
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEKRST M13 K.. +14 295
#note Again, the bingos don't play.  The intent here was to either giving him a distracation or, if he did something to kill row 14, leave myself somewhere for an easy 7.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACEFSU 12H FAUCES +38 315
#note Sam is winning over 50% for the first time this game, but not for long...
>Jim_Burlant: ?AERSTU 14B ESTRUAl +87 382
#note Initially annoyed when I saw the U but after taking 2 or 3 minutes to enumerate all the possibilities, I found it.   This is the only playable bingo and the game is now over.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?AIRSTU -  +0 315
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: NNO 8A NO.N +15 397
