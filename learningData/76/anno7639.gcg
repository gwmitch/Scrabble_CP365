#note Missing ADOBO 'cuz I'm dumb like that.

#note I almost instachallenged this. I was reaching for the clock, but first I took one quick glance at my rack and was like, "whoa, wait a minute, I just drew ABOITAU." So I held for about 5-6 minutes, trying to decide whether to leave the phony on and bingo back.
>Evans_Clinchy: AABIOTU 12C ABOIT.AU +70 86
#note My thinking: This gives me a 25-point lead with his blank already spent. If I challenge it off, I probably play OBA up top to block GULPIER (and then cross my fingers and pray he misses REPLOWING). So I'm up 39, but he still has a decent rack with a blank and can easily come back. I think letting the phony go is correct. The sim agrees.

#note Missed TERETE 4D. RETIE 4F might also be a better play than this, but I didn't mind the lower-turnover option.

#note Quackle recommends YINCE, which blocks his potential outbingos of NUDITIES and NOCTUIDS. Good call.

#note He has two outs -- ODIUM and DIMOUT in line 2. I should just play NICE here for the points.
