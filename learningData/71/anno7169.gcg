#note There are 12 E's and nine I's. One E and four I's have been played. Why, then, DO I HAVE THREE 3-I RACKS IN A ROW?!?! I knew this might set up Pete's bingo, but he had already taken a lot of time, it was late in the day, I just wanted to play fast.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AESTTW 3E SWATTEd +63 216
>Jason: CIPRVWY H1 PI.Y +39 202
#note Gotta love high-prob CPVWY draws. Didn't know WIC(O)PY. IV(O)RY is probably better, too.

>Jason: AAEEHRV C3 REA.H +28 291
#note A(M)AH, or even the simple HA at A14 is preferred. I think I got too paranoid about the S- hook to CREW; maybe I should've played DREW or something on that turn instead.

>Jason: ACEIUUV A1 VICE +43 354
#note Felt pretty good here, esp. with Pete low on time and a chance to get an extra 10 or 20.
>Pete_Zeigler: EGNOPRS N10 P.NGO +28 348
>Jason: ADENRUU B7 UNAU +11 365
#note Blocking his real bingo while hoping PENGO doesn't -S hook. Also leaving a guaranteed out, (WHO)RED preferably. Knew PENGO didn't -ES. To save spread (spread was meaningless at this point), Duck says AND at M13 to score and block his best bingo.
>Pete_Zeigler: AEFLRST 15H FALTERS +92 440
#note Hmph. Pete thought this was a desperation play, as he said he was "99% sure" PENGOS was phony. Alas.
