>Geoff: EEEEILO 7F LEE +17 53
#note So I used to trade too much, so I have it in my head not to trade so much, and sometimes it results in me not trading when I should. Aw heck, I have no idea, but yeah, I should have traded 5 here.
>Quackle: ?CIORRW 6H ROW +20 108
#note Heh, if this was Collins, the duck could have hit me with WIRRICOW#.
>Geoff: EEGIOOR 5I GOOIER +22 75
>Quackle: ?BCEGIR 4E ICeBERG +77 185
>Geoff: EENRUUZ 10B ZE.N +33 108
#note Ugh. 33 is enough inducement to play through, but not by that much.
>Quackle: ACDEILN 14F INLACED +74 259
>Geoff: EORTUUX H11 EXU.T +60 168
>Quackle: DGHILVV K11 VIV. +20 279
>Geoff: DEORTUW 15A TROWED +48 216
#note Had a small doubt at first whether TROW was a verb in TWL, but then I remembered it was. I'm surprised I don't mess that kind of distinction up more often than I do.
>Quackle: DGHIJLT 5B JILT +26 305
>Geoff: AAAMNUY N2 UNA.Y +32 248
>Quackle: ADGHLOT O1 GHAT +37 342
>Geoff: AABIIMS H1 IAM. +24 272
#note I was thinking here that I needed to keep opening different parts of the board. I didn't see M3 AB(E)AM for 40 - really should have, I have two A's and plays forming ANA should attract my eyes. IAMB or C1 IAMBI sims better than anything except ABEAM, but still. 
>Quackle: DELOORT 15L ORDO +22 364
>Geoff: ABHINPS M1 PHAS. +38 310
#note Bad play; lots of better choices. Turns out QUAFF and ICEBERG both take esses, what a shock ;) 
>Quackle: AAEELTT 9H TAE +11 375
>Geoff: BINNOPS 12J N.B +10 320
#note Play five tiles and hope that I draw out bingos in multiple spots? PINON or BISON 3A? Quackle likes OPSIN O6, but a sentient opponent would just block the remaining lanes, no? Yeah, I think the 3A plays are better than what I did.
>Quackle: AAELNOT N12 LOA. +10 385
>Geoff: DEINOPS 8J PONIED +34 354
#note Quackle claims to see a win if I fish off the D - huh? Doesn't look like anything in the pool gives me an unblockable bingo (while not giving Quackle an out bingo in the first place). PONIED does better damage control than anything else, anyway.
>Quackle: AEEINST F6 E..NS +25 410
>Geoff: SS 13M S.S +6 360
#note Nigel Richards would have played SOS here as well, mind you.
