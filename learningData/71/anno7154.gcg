#note Maybe I should have put the E on. Sim says it's about 5 points better, I guess because Brian's so likely to have an E.

#note WAGONER would no longer play, but it was nice to have this alternative.

#note QI was an interesting choice - I'd expect something taking out the triple (RIDGY or COYER). I suppose he keeps those plays in reserve, or GEY 7E to clear up the rack (which is what came to pass).
>Bing: EHIINTY O8 HINTE. +33 240
#note Not loving the IY leave, but nothing else came close in score. I guess something like IVY M12 might work out.

#note Now I was wishing I'd played something slotting an E!

#note Dang, so close to a bingo. But I was still in the hunt, if I could just find a vowel in the bag.

#note Nope, not this year. Well done, sir!
