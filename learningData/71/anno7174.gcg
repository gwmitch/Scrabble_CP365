>Nigel: DFGLPRS -DFGLP +0 0
>Rafi: AGNRRUV -RUV +0 0
#note Tough call. I think normally I would play GUV but after an exchange I thought it might be better to trade. GUV sucks if Nigel has an S, which is much more likely after an exchange.

>Rafi: AEGHINR L1 HEARING. +82 82
>Nigel: ?EEFMTZ K3 FEM +31 95
#note FEEZE is better.
>Rafi: GILOTXY M1 OXY +58 140
>Nigel: ?AENOTZ F1 oZONATE. +88 183
#note Either OZONATES opening the triple, or BENZOATE leaving a huge S hook. Pick your poison. AZO/OFAY is almost worth it, but not quite.
>Rafi: AGIILNT I8 .IGILANT +60 200
#note Missed RINGTAIL.
>Nigel: AAACHIO G2 AHA +32 215
>Rafi: JLMNPTV 11H J.MP +30 230
>Nigel: ACEEIOO 12H O.EIC +34 249
#note Pretty sweet for a 6 vowel rack!
>Rafi: IKLNTUV 1L ..NK +33 263
#note Quackle likes VITAL/JOT/MEL. I didn't think it was that good, but the leave is better and I have HONK in reserve.
>Nigel: AEENOTY 15G TE.ANY +39 288
#note Still a lot of vowels, including 5 E's and 4 O's, so ATONY is a bit better.
>Rafi: AGILTUV 5B GUAV. +18 281
#note Quackle likes VITAL and VAGAL more, but I hate to leave the U with 3 more unseen and 2 W's and a V. LIT seems promising with the tile pool, and I don't mind opening up a lane at this point. Maybe the extra points plus the Q make it worth keeping the U.
>Nigel: BEOOQRS C2 ROQ.E +28 316
#note ROQUE saves the valuable S, but BOSQUE scores 6 more and limits QI overlaps. SOBER or SOB are interesting as well, leaving the Q with an open U and 3 more unseen. All four plays sim within .5%.
>Rafi: DDEILNT D3 DI.LED +47 328
>Nigel: BEEOOSW H2 SOW +38 354
#note WO(E)SO(ME) is awesome, but a bad play. Keeping the S is important here, as BEEO could turn ugly with a decent amount of vowels remaining. OWE in the same spot looks good to me.
>Rafi: ADELNOT J2 DO +17 345
#note Lots of bingo draws available to AELNT, most of which start with a vowel or end in E.
>Nigel: BBCEEOU 14D CUBE +16 370
#note Wisely blocking both bingo lanes.
>Rafi: AAELNPT 13G PE.L +32 377
>Nigel: BEEORTU 7B UT. +20 390
#note This play is an overwhelming favorite, as Nigel has the only remaining hook for UTE.
>Rafi: AAINTUV D10 TUNI. +14 391
#note Knowing Nigel has the B, I decide to make a setup play of my own, giving myself a good shot at getting FAVA or VARA. I just have to hope he doesn't have the S.
>Nigel: BEEOORS 15A ORES +24 414
#note Very nice play, blocking my A setup and saving the B for BUTE.
