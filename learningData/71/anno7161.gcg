>Steve: DEHLO 8D HOLED +26 26
#note I held but didn't challenge.  Now you can laugh sarcastically.
>Joey: AADRRUW 7G WAUR +24 24
>Steve: ?DEIINO 6B IODINEs +70 96
#note I don't know how, but Steve managed to make my bingos homeless.
>Joey: ADEGPRS 5C GAP +26 50
#note Too early to try WAURS# out of desperation.
>Steve: AFIT 4A FIAT +34 130
>Joey: DEEORRS J7 .EORDERS +63 113
#note REREDOS never looks like a word.  I thought the third Dallas Open was called the REREDO, but it needs to have the S.  REREDOSES is the plural.
>Steve: CEOSYZ K2 COZEYS +48 178
>Steve: CEOSYZ --  -48 130
#note Now I know I could have gotten away with this, but at least I had this method of making the challenge grid greener.
>Joey: ADHIRSW 12D RAWHID.S +82 195
#note I knew this would give him a big comeback.  I could have lessened it by playing DISHWARE instead.
>Steve: CEOSYZ 11C COZ +52 182
>Joey: EGLORVY 13C VEG +30 225
>Steve: EOPSXY 8J .XPOSE +54 236
>Joey: AILORTY N8 .OLITARY +76 301
>Steve: JY 13M J.Y +26 262
#note This blocked the unlikely spot for BONELIKE*.  Thank goodness I didn't have to try it.
>Joey: BEEIKLN 15M K.E +30 331

>Steve: BIN 9C BIN +15 313
>Joey: BCGINUV O5 GIV.N +11 363
#note INCUBI 2A is cute, but I wanted to get rid of the V and block this lane.
>Steve: TTU 1A .UTT +7 320
>Joey: AABCNUU L4 UNCA. +18 381
#note I saw AUCUBA 2D, but no way am I opening a big fat hotspot.
>Steve: EE F8 .EE +11 331
>Joey: AABLOSU N5 AB +23 404
>Steve: R 10F .R +2 333
>Joey: AELOSTU -  +0 404
#note I think this is the first time ever that I've ever passed at this stage of the game, and I think it's best.  If the Q is in the bag, the game gets a little too close for comfort.  No bingos would win, but playing each letter off one at a time might have been enough.
>Steve: M M8 .M +15 348
>Joey: AELOSTU F2 LATE. +14 418
#note Blocking both ANTIQUE and MANTIQUE*.  OATEN is better because it gives me multiple out-plays.
