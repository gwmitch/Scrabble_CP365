#note Didn't want to give back any easy scoring opportunities on this board, hence no LUXE J12. Wanted to keep things relatively closed until I had a better rack to work with. Sim says ODE 7I, then this, then LUXE all within three points of each other.

#note I was completely lost here. I thought about just playing COZ D2, which wins the sim, but it seemed hopeless to take a 20-point lead with a rack full of clunkers and no good spots to play them. That lead would vanish mighty quick. So I got creative, opening the STYE hook and a chance to draw a five-tile play that fit there next turn (ideally something huge like GAUZE). I figure if I leave John the TWS in line 15 and don't create anything for myself, it's easy for him to control the rest of the game and win easily. I didn't have enough time to think this through. Probably just COZ is fine here, but I got paranoid and didn't think I could win that way.

>Evans_Clinchy: CCEGHUZ -CCGHU +0 321
#note Again, the sim likes just COZ, but digging into the bag felt right here. Didn't expect John to have a big play in either of the big TWS spots, given his last move, so I figured trading and keeping EZ would yield something heavy for next turn.
>John_O'Laughlin: IL 9F LI +15 338
>Evans_Clinchy: AELNPSZ 15A ZEALS +47 368
#note Well, the plan worked. But since I spent two turns dinking around doing nothing, it's still anyone's game.
>John_O'Laughlin: U 6D U. +2 340
>Evans_Clinchy: CCGINPU C6 CUP +13 381
#note Best is CUING C6, which blocks his big 8A plays (like SIDHE) and and keeps two outs for next turn (COP D2, PIC 8B). But John's a minute over on time at this point, so this wins too. I didn't have time to find the best sequence. This endgame was pretty rushed on both sides.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEHIORS M2 .HIS +42 382
#note Best. He has eight different spots for DEOR to go out.
>Evans_Clinchy: CGIN E11 CIN.. +14 395
#note Best, blocking his best outplay of REDO 12F.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEOR 13A REDO. +12 394
#note Final score 395-388.
