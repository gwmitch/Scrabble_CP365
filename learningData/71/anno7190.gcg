>mikeecsedy: AAIUVWY 8G VAW +18 18
#note (This was a speed game on ISC, played on 9/19/2010.) -9.7, 8G WAVY. He could at least have played VAU.
>volucris: GGHLLNT H7 G.LL +5 5
#note -3.0, exch GHLT. GALL is the best scoring play and wins in equity.
>mikeecsedy: AIINOUY I8 .AIN +13 31
#note -12.2, 11H YOU.
>volucris: AEGHNTW 10E WHA..NG +24 29
#note -1.9, J9 GNAW. Again my play wins in equity, but loses a sim.
>mikeecsedy: IJOPRUY 11D JO +28 59
#note -2.0, 11B PYRO. This time it's his play that wins in equity.
>volucris: EFSTTUZ J3 FUTZES +48 77
>mikeecsedy: AEIPRUY D11 .URY +28 87
#note This time his play loses in equity (to F10 HEAPY) but wins the sim. Heh.
>volucris: AEIRRTY 5G TER.IARY +72 149
>mikeecsedy: ABEIPRT H1 TRIP. +30 117
#note -12.5, 4J UPBEAR. This also loses a bunch of B and AB fishes, plus TRIBE.
>volucris: AADEILL 14B LA.ED +26 175
#note -1.7, 4L LEAD. Same leave, one less point, but...
>mikeecsedy: ABEFINO A12 INFO +37 154
#note ...yeah.
>volucris: ?AEILOR 15E LOAmIER +73 248
#note -1.3, 1H (T)AILOREd. I'm going up, so I'd rather block the too-easy O lane. But 15F OARLIkE (-0.6) does that better.
>mikeecsedy: ABDDEQT 14J BATED +40 194
#note -1.0, B10 QAT. That blocks a lane, but BATED's leave gives him even less flexibility.
>volucris: DEEHMNS M3 HE.DSMEN +82 330
>mikeecsedy: ABDEINQ 4L B.AD +31 225
#note -8.3, 6F QI. His winning percentage is now sub-1%; he should probably try to bingo.
>volucris: AMORSUX 8M .AX +36 366
#note -0.5, G2 OX. Somewhat hilariously, OX is 5 points better in equity.
>mikeecsedy: EINOPQT 13K PINE +26 251
#note -14.8, 6F QI. If Mike loves the Q so much he should play 13J OPINE or 13K PINOT
>volucris: CMORSUV 6C MUCRO +13 379
#note -10.7, G3 MUT. Nice "block," you idiot. 
>mikeecsedy: EINOOQT D3 TOQ.E +28 279
>volucris: ?CESSTV 8A VEST +40 419
>mikeecsedy: EIIIKNO O1 KIN. +27 306
#note -24.5, E2 IONIC. Quackle is maintaining that KIND has a 0.01% winning chance, but since there's only one tile in the bag I don't even know what that means. Crackle!
>volucris: ?CEGOSU E4 Si. +30 449
#note -22.3, C1 ECU. (This should be an integer. Weird stuff happens when I manually add a move to championship player's choices and try to "sim" it.) 
>mikeecsedy: EIIOO O7 O.O +10 316
#note -6, 11K OI.
>volucris: CEGOU 12L GO +17 466
>mikeecsedy: EII F10 .E +15 331
>volucris: CEU 2F CU.E +12 478
#note -6, N4 (AY)E. Also missed F2 CUE and C1 ECU/CUE to go out for more.
>volucris:  (II) +4 482
