>Toh_Weibin: ?AEIINS 8D ASINInE +64 64
#note This looked like the best to me, because it looked like the blockiest (it probably isn't). A lot of options for this move, so I can't really tell what's the best.
>mrweary: BCEGITU E6 BU.TIC +20 20
#note I remember this word from one of Pakorn's ISC games. Takes S; extension is BUSTIC(ATE). This is not really the best move though.
>Toh_Weibin: ADNOTTX 10D T.X +26 90
#note Keeps the lines open for a good chance at drawing a bingo next turn.
>mrweary: EGHIIMR 7H HIM +20 40
>Toh_Weibin: ADILNOT F5 DO +11 101
#note And he blocked them all! This opens up and doesn't give away too much - not much else I can do with this rack.
>mrweary: EFGIPRS 6H PREIF +29 69
>Toh_Weibin: AAILNTV 4B VALIANT +76 177
>mrweary: GMOPRSZ M3 GROSZ +61 130
>Toh_Weibin: ?ADEKOU 8M EUK +37 214
#note And the blank!
>mrweary: DEIIMPT 4L P.IM +22 152
>Toh_Weibin: ?ADELOT N7 O.TLEADs +81 295
#note O(U)TLAwED would have been a better choice. I also failed to spot D11 O(C)uLATED, which is pretty close to O(U)TLEADs IMO.
>mrweary: DEEEIST 13G STEEDIE. +74 226
>Toh_Weibin: CEEEGGI K9 EGGE. +16 311
#note CIGG(I)E is a little more risky in my opinion, and leaves the less palatable EE.
>mrweary: AADENOW O1 DAE.ON +27 253
#note AD(V)EW is the clear choice here.
>Toh_Weibin: ACEIRSU 14C SAUCIER +71 382
#note I don't know CURA(C)IES A11, but the game is almost secured at this point.
>mrweary: AJLQRUW N2 JA. +42 295
#note Though JA(I) nets a high score, it might in this instance be wiser to play off the W as well and leave more possibilities open.
>Toh_Weibin: FLNOOWY 15A FLOW +53 435
#note Should have rethought this move to come up with FLOWN.
