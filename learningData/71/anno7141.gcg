>Ryan_Fischer: BEEINOT 8C EBONITE +74 74
#note Kenji says putting this here is a minor error, but not one so big as to be detrimental.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ABH 7G BAH +33 33
#note That's why, but it could be worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: FGINORU 9C FINO +28 102
#note 9E FUG 24 is a little better, as is 9C FOR.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEGILLM 10F MEGILLA +79 112
>Ryan_Fischer: ACGRTUY L6 ACTU.RY +26 128
#note 3rd behind 11C YUGA and K8 UG(L)Y.  Oh well.  Scores best at least.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ALUV M3 ULVA +16 128
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGIRZ 11B GRAZE +36 164
#note I think this is right.  I forgot to write down my leave.  If so, GAZE is preferable leaving EIR.  Really?  Even exposing that A hook?  Okay.  Playing GAZER instead of GRAZE is 2nd.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IRY B11 .YRI +16 144
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIISSW 12A W.ES +34 198
#note Of note: G6 I(BI)S(E)S 34.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: IQ A14 QI +44 188
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEIIRS 11K I.ID +14 212
#note I spent several minutes trying to find a bingo, and now to my delight there is NOTHING in the way of 7s or 8s!  :)  E1 DIvERSI(ON) 68!  So, this play is pretty good.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: MPU 8L .UMP +24 212
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEERS 13D SEDAtER +62 274
#note This play bugged me for a while, and on the way home I was anagramming in my head as I am won't to do, and I FINALLY found (P)RESAgED to the triple for 89!  Lame that I gave up 20+ pts there, not that it mattered too much.  Also of note are PERSUADE and RESPREAD.  I should've at least played RESEALED, but I was really being lazy.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DORT 7B TROD +22 234
>Ryan_Fischer: EGHNOPT N6 HE.P +33 307
>Kenji_Matsumoto: EINNT B2 INTEN. +16 250
#note 12G NINET(Y) 21 is really cool, but he needs to open.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EFGNOT 6F FOG +24 331
>Kenji_Matsumoto: DEUW 3A U.WED +18 268
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EINNOT 14I TENsION +72 403
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AEJ O12 JA.E +57 325
#note He told me earlier he was fishing for some J play at O1, but I forget what.  A 6 no doubt with the J on the DLS.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACRSSTV 15H VAC +32 435
#note Saw SCARTS, but VAC setting up TRESS or TRUSS is better.  Champ says (E)SC(A)RS G10 24 (presumably setting up VA(S)T to go out) is even better.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: AKLOOOX 4D LOOK +23 348
>Ryan_Fischer: RSST 3K TR.SS +5 440
#note Pretty easy game, noteworthy (or not) 'cause I pretty much bagged him, gave up at least 20 points, and still won by 100+.  Eesh.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (AOX) +20 460
