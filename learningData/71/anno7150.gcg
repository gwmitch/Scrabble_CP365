>Chris_Lipe: ACELQTW H4 CALQ.E +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AGIMMST 10H SIGMA +30 42
#note Taking the points seemed reasonable here, but the sim seems to slightly prefer opening another S-hook lane with MAGMA 5G. The position after MAGMA is kinda crappy for Chris if he doesn't have an S of his own, I guess.
>Chris_Lipe: AFNTTVW 5G F.TWA +22 42
>Evans_Clinchy: AEHMSTT L1 MATHS +38 80
#note Seems pretty clear to me now that MATH 11K is the stronger play, holding the S and opening a triple lane for it. Not sure why this didn't occur to me over the board.
>Chris_Lipe: DGNOTVW 2J TW.NG +22 64
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEIOTT 1H TEE +11 91
#note EMOTE K9 and TOE 11I are options, but with a slight lead and a not-very-good rack, I prefer to close lanes. Debatable choice here.
>Chris_Lipe: DNOORVY L8 OV.RY +24 88
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEILOT 4B ALOETI. +23 114
#note This isn't bad, but an interesting option is MOA K10 to keep AEILT and set up a T hook. I figured I'd rather dig into the bag for blanks.
>Chris_Lipe: DIINOOX E4 .XODOI +28 116
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIOPZ 8K Z.EAE +42 156
#note Missed EPIZOA 2C. If I'm going to go for turnover, I might as well stick with it...
>Chris_Lipe: DEGINSU D9 SUEDING +74 190
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AIIOPU C1 POI.U +14 170
#note UNAI M1 is better than this. Gotta keep scoring to stay competitive.
>Chris_Lipe: AEFJNPS 1A JA.E +42 232
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADEIOY O1 AYE +31 201
#note Figured I'd take the points now, since lots of draws can bail me out with the blank in hand. Sim prefers YO F6, scoring a little less but keeping ADEI?.
>Chris_Lipe: FNOPRRS 15A FRO. +24 256
>Evans_Clinchy: ??DILOR O8 .RODIbLe +74 275
#note Couldn't afford to spend the time finding a bingo doubling the D. EXORDIAL and EVILDOER are there for three extra.
>Chris_Lipe: ENPRSUV 11B PR.VUE +22 278
>Evans_Clinchy: ABEIKRT 13C K.BEI +24 299
#note BORATE 2B is better, scoring 30 and leaving a tile in the bag. Plenty of spots to score something with the K next turn, no need to rush it.
>Chris_Lipe: CENNNRS 2B N.NCE +24 302
>Evans_Clinchy: AHIIORT N10 HIT +32 331
#note NOH 14D is better, keeping INIA M1 for next turn and angling for the optimal out-in-three sequence.
>Chris_Lipe: LNNRS F10 R.L.S +9 311
>Evans_Clinchy: AIOR 7A AROI. +7 338
#note Going out in two is better. OAR 11J (17) + RIP B9 (7) = way more than this.
