#note Didn't think of BANDA, a point better than either ABATED or DAB.

#note 9G a half point ahead of 7G, not sure why. 7G FIE does as well. I did consider it - UNABATED is a quick 33 next turn, for what it's worth - but ruled it out and I'm surprised it simmed quite that well.

#note Er, that was silly. Lost two points by putting a blank instead of the I at G13. Briefly thought about passing it up to play IF for 37, which sims two points behind bingoing (assuming proper blank placement).

>Geoff: ABEEGST 5H BEAT +23 213
#note Okay, BAG, but how is it 8 points better? I think a human is more likely to reply on row 5 than Quackle is, so maybe that explains some of it.

#note Thanks, Quackle!

#note Too cute. I figured better than average chance of AN/AR in Quackle's last leave and possible bingo proneness, so I forwent WAI(V)E and blocked lanes up top. But even putting Quackle on an A in its leave barely changes anything. AIWW (or EIWW, with AUK; about the same) is even worse than KUW, and WAIVE is 8 more points. AUK's better than UKE, I think, but WAIVE's clearly what I should have done.

>Geoff: AEINTWW 7C NAW +22 350
#note Quackle just fished off an R for 3. My play block the C column, gives back the B column with an S hook but with likely counterplay for me. But I'm missing the bigger threat - an H1 bingo forming CUKE or NUKE. WINE/NUKE takes that away.
