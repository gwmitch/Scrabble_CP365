>Evans_Clinchy: BDEEHIO 7M HOE +21 21
#note The better play here is OBE 7L, which sets up an H play for next turn.
>Nigel_Peltier: IJ J6 JI. +26 106
>Evans_Clinchy: BDEGIIO 5J DOBIE +28 49
#note I hate what this does to the board, since I'm down 85 and this play kills bingo possibilities. But how much equity can I possibly give up to keep things open, this early in the game? BIDI 5H doesn't feel right. EGO is a clunky leave.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEEERTT C3 EATER +25 272
#note Thought I had to take this, both for the points and for opening a hook that could help me later. Drawing an N here would be nice. The sim suggests TEE 14M, but I'm not sure where it expects me to bingo.
>Nigel_Peltier: GINZ 2A ZING +34 343
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEOTTX 9L EXED +50 322
#note Just OX or EX would keep a more potent leave, but with this board and this pool, I didn't much care for a fishier play. I think my best chance to win is to take points, pray that Nigel's drawing complete dreck, and hope to outrun.
>Nigel_Peltier: IRRY E2 YIRR +32 375
>Evans_Clinchy: GLMOPTT 12A L.T +6 328
#note Unless I'm bad at math, my odds of drawing IMPETIGO 3E are 32:1. It's the only possible win I could think of, so why not try it?
>Nigel_Peltier: EEQU F6 QUEE. +34 409
>Evans_Clinchy: GILMOPT 14M TOP +23 351
#note Best, with multiple spots for GLIM next turn.
