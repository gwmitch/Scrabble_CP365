#note Blocking SNOODING, and surviving the ridiculous looking GOODISH.  I could have blocked both, but his rack looked really menacing and thought there might have been a bingo through the L.

#note If Richard had played GOODISH, he would have originally won by 1 point, but lost by 2 on the recount.  Glad it didn't come to that.
