>Geoff: AAKTWWY 8G WAW +18 18
#note The duck likes 8F WAW by a point. Maybe my K or Y will score well on the resulting board next turn?
>Quackle: EEGHIJL I6 JE. +14 14
>Geoff: AIKPTTY G6 PA.KY +23 41
#note Didn't like 7F TAK(E) with its front S-hook after opp's JE(W) play. PAWKY sims best anyway.
>Quackle: EGGHILY 6I .IGGLY +28 42
>Geoff: DEILTTU K6 .LUTTED +18 59
#note Too deep into the rack? J8 LITU keeping TED wins the sim, followed by various short plays like UT, TUT, LIT. Passed up 2 points playing it where I did, not liking the E next to the DWS. Quackle doesn't agree with that either; L6 sims a point better.
>Quackle: ADEEHHT L11 HEATH +41 83
>Geoff: DEILOSS 14E SOLIDES. +63 122
>Quackle: ABDEIMR 15A BARMIE +43 126
>Geoff: DEFIOTZ 15H FED +42 164
#note Look everywhere, dude...didn't see ZOFTI(G) for 58. FED's next best, about 6 points back.
>Quackle: ?DENNRV N2 NERV. +22 148
>Geoff: BEIIOTZ F10 BIO +24 188
#note L4 BIGOT by a little bit. Just playing BI where I played BIO also about as good.
>Quackle: ?DLNOOT 3G gOLDTON. +68 216
>Geoff: ?EIMNTZ B14 Z. +22 210
#note Considered (U)NMET...maybe I get ZA in the corner next turn and keep the blank, etc. My play isn't terrible, but it strikes me as uncreative at best.
>Quackle: AFINQRV C11 INVA. +27 243
>Geoff: ?AEIMNT D6 AMNIoTE +74 284
#note The 74-point bingos from E4 and D6 all fare about the same. Put down TEgMINA first, but didn't like the cheap QI/QI spot. Then again, there are already multiple X spots elsewhere - if I get the Q and not the X, I might need QI there.
>Quackle: FOPQRSU H1 PO.F +39 282
>Geoff: CCEEIOU F4 ECU +13 297
#note Bad miss. No idea why HUIC didn't occur to me.
>Quackle: ANQRRSU 4B QUAR. +28 310
>Geoff: ACEIIOT 8A COI. +18 315
#note Guess Quackle's got both esses. Sim gives me much better winning chances than I think I really have at this point.
>Quackle: EGNRRRS 8K .RGER +21 331
>Geoff: AAEIINT 5A AI +13 328
#note URGER was a surprise, seemed to give me even better chances than I had before. (Quackle had EGRRRNS, so yeah, there are racks from which URGER's right.) My play sims best - not really sure what else would make any sense, at least.


>Quackle: ENOORSU B10 ONO +11 342
>Geoff: AEINSTX 4K AX +38 366
#note Hmm, an S, whaddaya know. Didn't matter much. I didn't see Quackle's winning URS(A)E, but S(A)X to block it only does 3 points better, not enough to win. The game was lost earlier...thought I had it with AX. In real life, I'd have hoped for my opponent to try RUSE forming GOLDTONES*.
