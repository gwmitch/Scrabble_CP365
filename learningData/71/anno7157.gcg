>Matt_Bernardina: AEHLSTY 8H LATHY +30 30
>Ian_Weinstein: AAG 9H AGA +15 15
>Matt_Bernardina: AEGLOOS 10H GOO +19 49
#note Best, even if we're heading towards a closed board.
>Ian_Weinstein: AN K10 NA +9 24
>Matt_Bernardina: AEEJLOS 12H JOLES +43 92
#note AJEE keeping LOS is competitive with JOLES, even being 19 less points.  Is the S that valuable on this board?  Or is it also slotting the J in the triple lane?
>Ian_Weinstein: EZ J12 .EZ +32 56
#note Oh, if he has a 2nd E then I get burnt big time.  That may be why.
>Matt_Bernardina: AEEIMRT 14J .AIRE +28 120
#note Don't know why I became blind to J plays all of a sudden, with my homeless EMIRATE rack.  JETE/JEER are fine.
>Ian_Weinstein: ANORRST N7 ANTRORS. +60 116
#note Only bingo, but at least I have a comeback.
>Matt_Bernardina: DEEKMNT O4 KENTE +50 170
#note Best by a bunch.
>Ian_Weinstein: IMP H12 .IMP +45 161
#note And now I get punished for not taking two turns earlier.  Only fair I suppose.
>Matt_Bernardina: DEIMRTU M2 TEDIUM +32 202
#note Another best
>Ian_Weinstein: OOW 4J WOO. +16 177
>Matt_Bernardina: AFIRSVV 5L F.V. +15 217
#note Either this, VIVA 3G, or K1 FAVOR.  I also thought of VAW.  Any of those plays other than FIVE blocks his next play.
>Ian_Weinstein: AOQU 2J QUO.A +68 245
#note He told me when he played WOOD that he had OOOQUW and one other tile, so he was hoping to draw an A or E and that I'd leave the slot alone.  So much for my lead.
>Matt_Bernardina: AINRSTV 13G V.N. +15 232
#note With only one O left (but both blanks), this isn't super risky.  Quackle also likes VATU 6J, but that really destroys the top of the board.
>Ian_Weinstein: D I7 D... +8 253
#note He thought I'd had a bingo for sure at this point, so he got extra defensive and blocked the only S hook.  
>Matt_Bernardina: AIRSSTY O1 IS +21 253
#note Wasn't totally sure what to do here, but IS is near the top with YA 1N and SI O14.
>Ian_Weinstein: CDEEIL 5E DECILE +23 276
>Matt_Bernardina: ANRSTUY 4C YUAN +19 272
#note YURTA sims best, but it's very possible he had DOXY ready to go to reply.  This was just trying to get rid of the Y and U, but it sets up his X nicely.
>Ian_Weinstein: LOX 3B LOX +39 315
>Matt_Bernardina: BIIRRSU F2 BI..R +15 287
#note Trying to balance and fork open another lane for my S.  Quackle prefers exchanging or BI 6J.  
>Ian_Weinstein: ETW 2A WET +22 337
>Matt_Bernardina: GIIIRSU -GIIU +0 287
#note Quackle likes throwing back everything but the S.  I thought of keeping the I and R since those were the case letters (aside from the I's I was exchanging), but maybe I should be trying for those blanks.  
>Ian_Weinstein: DEF G1 DEF +24 361
>Matt_Bernardina: ?AEHIRS 15A EARlSHI. +86 373
#note Very happy to find this, after thinking I might have to fish yet again.  It's now a toss-up as I empty the bag.  wEARISH and bEARISH 7A are the only other bingoes.  
>Ian_Weinstein: ?BGNRTU E10 GRUNT. +14 375
#note Unfortunately, he has the last blank and an unblockable out in 2 that scores big.  This is the optimal sequence.
>Matt_Bernardina: CEIIP B12 PIC. +16 389
#note This is best at least, but too little too late.  
>Ian_Weinstein: ?B 1A aB +26 401
>Ian_Weinstein:  (EI) +4 405
