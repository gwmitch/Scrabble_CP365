>Quackle: CIKMORU 5G MUCKI.R +30 50
>Geoff: AABEHNV 9G BAH +26 44
#note Couldn't decide between 4D HAVEN and what I did. Quackle likes HAVEN about 3 better. I was thinking BAH gave back a little less and AENV > AB, but HAVEN is 5 more points. Yeah, probably should have taken the points.
>Quackle: DINOOOO -DIOOOO +0 50
>Geoff: AEGINPV 4D VEGAN +27 71
#note GIVEN in the same spot, yeah, I agree, not sure why I didn't think of it. Whole bunch of plays all within 1-2 points here.
>Quackle: AENRTWY 3E WAY +33 83
>Geoff: AIIIOPQ 10F QI +35 106
#note That'll teach me to make a slightly suboptimal play keeping an I...no-brainer here; best hope is Quackle doesn't have an I, of course.
>Quackle: AEEINRT 11B ARENITE +80 163
#note Curious choice by Quackle here - why not TRAINEE 11C? The sim appears to say that Q's next play is lessened by TRAINEE vis-a-vis ARENITE than opp's is. How so?
>Geoff: ADIIOOP C9 PA.ODOI +26 132
#note Too good a cleaner to pass up, but some B10 replies could really hurt.
>Quackle: ?AIJNNS D8 JAN.S +50 213
>Geoff: CGITVXZ B10 V.GI +37 169
#note VAGI takes the hottest spot, and picking an O makes a big COZ/ZAG play possible. I didn't consider (E)VICT. Interesting that EVICT finishes ahead in equity, but VAGI in win pct. 
>Quackle: ?AEILNU 15A qU.NIELA +122 335
>Geoff: ?ACOTXZ 2B TOpAZ +105 274
#note I took the points, figuring that with an X in the leave I wouldn't likely bingo next turn and TOpAZ sets up another good scoring X spot that COZ doesn't. Not sure I was right - COZ plus an X bingo (not likely, but drawing from this pool to ATX?, not impossible) might be necessary for me to have a chance here. Though I think sims would overstate those chances - unless I hit right away, a human's going to uglify the board more than the duck would.

#note Ah, kind of gave up here. SWOB 13L, yeah. Or BLOWSED in the M column, which does a better job of what I was vaguely trying to do.
