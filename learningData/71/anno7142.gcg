#note Crap, missed PRIV(Y).  I'm surprised IV(Y) for 9 fares so well.
>Ian_Weinstein: DEFR 6F FR.ED +21 39
>Ryan_Fischer: IIIJMRV 5H .RIMI +23 39
#note Meh.  What was said about playing through racks like this?  I don't know.  Best.  I sure shouldn't take no points.
>Ian_Weinstein: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 39
#note "Hey, Brian, there's a spooky message in my Alphabits.  It says 'ooooo!'"  "Peter, those are Cheerios."
>Ryan_Fischer: CEIJOSV 5C JIVE +33 72
>Ian_Weinstein: EMNORSS J8 SERMONS +73 112
#note And of course he strikes first again.  I guess this wouldn't have been as much of an issue if I hadn't tried fighting through JVII type racks, but if I'd gotten down PRIV(Y) it wouldn't be that bad.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACIOOSW 11J .IAOW +20 92
#note Volatility, I'm courting you.  I'd like to take you out for a nice dinner, see where things go, you know?
>Ian_Weinstein: DELTW D4 W.LTED +22 134
#note And just like that, the top three rows of the board are dead (barring HA(J) ever bein the best play, a scenario in which an open board there is still 3 moves away).
>Ryan_Fischer: ACOOSUU -COOUU +0 92
#note I... don't like keeping a C here because the board is getting tight and what if I don't hit the bingo?  Because there's an A open, I guess it's okay to keep CS though instead of AS.  I'm not good at weighing these things.
>Ian_Weinstein: IQ 4L QI +44 178
#note Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEISTTU 14C SITUATE. +60 152
>Ian_Weinstein: EGORU C9 ERUGO. +20 198
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEKNRU 12A KA.U +28 180
#note Yeah, I probably should've played KUE opening another S hook up top, keeping AENR.  But, I was just a little too gunshy opening that 3x3 there.  I was still very much in it, even on this tight board, and I figured that would allow him to play through, kill the MIAOW hook, and, oh, I don't know, it just didn't look pretty there.  But KA(G)U kills two (not very fruitful) lines, too!
>Ian_Weinstein: ?BDDEIO M8 BlO.DIED +72 270
#note 0/7 on blanks versus Ian now.  To his credit this is the only bingo.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEENRT A8 RETA.E +30 210
#note If RETA(K)E, then RETA(K)EN!  But really it should be (K)NEE.  Oops.
>Ian_Weinstein: AHN 15G NAH +31 301
>Ryan_Fischer: BCEHINT 12I B.NE. +22 232
#note No place to go with this bitchen, benthic rack.  :(  L10 B(A)ITH 37 -- didn't see it, didn't even look vertically at all.  I played BONED to keep the synergistic CHIT.  It's 5th.
>Ian_Weinstein: GO 8M .OG +18 319
#note Well, now I wish I'd've kept that N, but this changes things a bit.  MIAOW hook is less potent but still viable.  ING stuff in play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACHILST O11 SHALT +47 279
#note Best.  HA(J) is just praying for an NA draw or something, which I guess isn't too unlikely.  Still, he'd have to not block.
>Ian_Weinstein: ATV 3M TAV +16 335
#note Very surprising play, lets the door wide open...
>Ryan_Fischer: ACINOYZ O1 CA.Y +48 327
#note Before this I was considering COZYIN(G) which pretty much surrenders.  Now it's the auto play, setting up Z(A).
>Ian_Weinstein: F 2N F. +20 355
#note But of course he sees the possibiility and blocks.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ILNORZ N6 ZO. +32 359
#note Well, it turns out ZO(O) is a no-brainer here for now.  Thought there would be something more complicated.
>Ian_Weinstein: AELNO 10E LOANE. +8 363
#note I don't quite understand how he was able to calculate that with 1 in the bag he could outscore me, but I guess what it does do is prevent me from making any setups that fish.  So, no bingos.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CILNRU 6B Co. +18 377
#note Well, RETAKERS is good.  So is RESITUATES.  So my best play, with a 50/50 win chance is RETAKERS.  Then if he plays ONE as he was going to, I win by 1 point!  If he finds ENOL, though, it's a tie.  I don't know why I didn't just try RETAKERS, but down low on time, thinking you have to get rid of the C and/or block, you really can't think straight.
