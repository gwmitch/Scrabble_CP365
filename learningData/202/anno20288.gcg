#note Paul missed COTQUEAN.  Not that I noticed that or anything.  I only know it because Paul mentioned at the end of the game that he noticed he missed COTQUEAN around his third turn.

#note Are you KIDDING me?  I did consider exchanging 6, keeping the T but I decided that UPBY edges out exchanging. 
>Paul_Avrin: AA F10 AA +15 29
>Tasha: ?BLTWWY J6 W.LT +15 85
#note I missed WILY,  but I like keeping BY.  It's pretty close between WILY, WIT, and WILT.  
>Paul_Avrin: AU D8 .UA +21 50
>Tasha: ?BGRTWY G11 WRY +22 107
#note D8 QUART is the play that sims better than WRY.  But considering my rack situation and the fact that Paul played off four tiles in two turns, WRY is probably better.
