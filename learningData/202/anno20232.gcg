>Marty_Gold: CDEFNRU 8G CURF +18 18
#note So, we come to the last round, and this is the game where I feel like I played very poorly and just made some really dumb mistakes, and Paul was able to capitalize on them. It may be have physical and mental exhaustion by this point as well. Anyway, we drew for first and I won that.

8D FECUND would have been 32. CP chose my play second.
>Paul_Peyser: AM 7H MA +12 12
>Marty_Gold: ADEHLNN G8 .HANNEL +17 35
#note I don't know why I always feel the need to open up the baord, but I didn't know what else to do. This probably opens up way too many potential hot spots. CP likes 6G HELD for 20. Not sure about leaving the double N in the leave. My play is on the list, but barely.
>Paul_Peyser: AHY H13 HAY +34 46
#note And here's Paul capitalizing on my inability to play defensively.
>Marty_Gold: ?DIJLOR 10C RIOJ. +28 63
#note CP likes 10F J(A)IL for 27. 10F J(A)ILOR would have been 31. My play's not bad.
>Paul_Peyser: BINY C9 B.INY +26 72
#note Not bad.
>Marty_Gold: ?DELOSW I14 WO +16 79
#note Now this was by far my crappiest play of the day. I was really excited at the prospect of playing  WORDLESS again after playing it in round 5 against Mary. Then of course, it was blocked by B(R)INY. Then, I saw WO(O)DLESS, but chickened out. It's good. As it turns out, there are at least 15 other bingoes I missed, DEWoOLS, ScOWLED, bLOWSED. I should have found ScOWLED. So then, on top of all of this, I decide to lose OW for 16 points without realizing that I could have dropped the same OW for 31.
>Paul_Peyser: OW 11E WO. +31 103
#note Which is exactly what he does, and even comments on it.
>Marty_Gold: ?DEGLOS K3 GODLESs +76 155
#note K5 dOGSLED or GLOSsED would have been 92. One bright spot about this play is that this won me "Best Festivus Word" and a copy of Letterati, which I still haven't read. 
>Paul_Peyser: EEIINRT 3D RETIEIN. +61 164
#note 3H REI(G)NITE would have been 70, but that doesn't count on my stupidity making this the far superior play.
>Marty_Gold: AABEOPT -  +0 155
#note And I challenge RETIEING. Why? It looked weird. Why? I don't know. 
>Paul_Peyser: ADX H1 AX.D +42 206
#note And once again, Paul capitalizes on my dumbassery.

>Marty_Gold: AABEOPT B12 OBA +19 174
#note CP and Q like F14 BA for 25. My win % is now down to 21.81.
>Paul_Peyser: EFNU A9 ENUF +21 227
#note This ends up being a nice set-up for him.
>Marty_Gold: EIOPRTT 6J P.OT +12 186
#note I forgot to write this rack down, but I'm pretty sure this is what it was. CP seems to think it's an OK play, 5th choice. CP likes L4 POI for 23.
>Paul_Peyser: EERV 2B VEER +18 245
#note Nice way to neutralize the NW corner.
>Marty_Gold: AEIRTTT 6B ATTRITE +66 252
#note This was held briefly but released. My win % is up to 41.52 with this play.
>Paul_Peyser: DEE D12 DEE +32 277
#note This was a nice play. I wonder if he had the DE on his rack when he played ENUF.
>Marty_Gold: KLOPRSS N2 PORKS +35 287
#note Pretty sure I'm not going to bingo now, so I just need points. Q and CP like 4A KOPS. 
>Paul_Peyser: IQ O1 QI +37 314
#note Nice.
>Marty_Gold: DELMSTZ 4A ZEDS +54 341
#note Maybe I can still salvage this thing after all.
>Paul_Peyser: ?EGINSU 12F E.SUrING +89 403
#note On the other hand, maybe not. This was a brilliant play, and the game is all over but the shouting.
>Marty_Gold: AAALMOT 11J AMA +21 362
#note CP likes 11K MOAT, but my win % is down to 0.
>Paul_Peyser: CGIILUV 10L VIG +17 420
>Marty_Gold: ALOT O10 ALTO +13 375
#note I saw TOLA and LOTA and chickened out...again. Even though I'm supposedly solid on 4s. Meh, what's 7 points?
>Marty_Gold:  (CILU) +12 387
#note So, I made way too many mistakes to beat a solid player. Paul was a very pleasant opponent, and I hope we get to play again.
