#note After the game I asked Michael if he considered MOVED 4D here. He did not register the hook possibility until later.
>Morris_Greenberg: ABEHNPY D9 HYENA +43 126
#note A lot of interesting options here. I ultimately decided to go for the points in a way that keeps a hot spot for my B on my rack that Michael will likely only hit if he has the K or a W. I certainly also considered D11 HYENA (but thought it was a bit wreckless), BAY and BAH D10 (but thought it offered too easy of a counterplay for Michael that I couldn't make back the turn after), and YAH F10 (I thought it was pretty much as clunky leave, for 4 fewer points).

Another nice option I did not consider here is HYPE 4I for 42. I caught a break that Michael missed DJINN once, but how long can that persist? Blocking that area for 42 points while keeping a solid leave has little downside. HYENA or HYPE both seem fine, Quackle slightly prefers HYENA, I am not sure which I prefer now.

#note I missed ThUNDER C3, but I saw all of DaUNTER, pRUDENT, and UNDREsT. I chose this play instead because after a bingo here, Michael needs two bingos to come back. While I am leaving the easiest line open with this play, it manages to take out basically everything else.
>Michael_Baker: HPU C13 HUP +30 181
>Morris_Greenberg: AEEIIOT 5C IOTA +19 316
#note I was choosing between IOTA and TO(P)I 15A this turn, and decided to turn over the extra vowel and block the likelier lane than the more costly lane. I would probably change this to TO(P)I if I were doing this again. A bingo in column C won't be enough for Michael, but a bingo in row 15 may.

>Morris_Greenberg: GNOOST A1 ..G +7 443
#note Quackle says (FA)T nets a few more. But, I came up with an out sequence that nets 1 more than the best with FAT. I could've netted two more points though (fun puzzle for all of you scrabble junkies out there).
