#note for some reason I telescoped in on VEXER - either REVIEW or WIVER sim better.

#note the only play superior to exchanging
>Eric_Cahanin: ACDER 13C CADRE +26 74
>JD: DEINOOU -OOU +0 120
#note I have some reasonable plays I can make here, most notably ODOUR at H4 which blocks things up and keeps a fine leave.

#note quackle always likes plays that open triple-triples while holding the blank - why not here? YALD at D12 looks reasonable.
>Eric_Cahanin: AENORST J1 TREASON +69 200
>JD: ?ACLMNS D10 ALM. +28 256
#note he blocked my planned play of CLANSMAN, but I'm still in fine shape. quackle suggests MAN at D10, but that may backfire long run by making it impossible for me to close the board after bingoing.
>Eric_Cahanin: ABOU 1G BOU. +18 218
#note he flashed an A
>JD: ?CINRST L6 INCRuST +90 346
#note he challenged since this basically seals the game for me.

#note : O well this is embarassing...I saw GRISTLE and then forgot I could play it at the bottom...I think I was also low on time...at least I get to fish for a big bingo from the F, although he will most likely block once I fish
