#note Morris said I blocked the TWSTWS illuders*. I told him I wished I played elsewhere.
>Chris: EGIOORZ 2M ZO. +24 111
#note My ZOOIER for 50 got blocked.
>opp: AOR 10D ORA +12 121
>Chris: DEGIORV 11F GROVED +29 140
#note This appeared the easier of the lines, so I blocked here. Hated breaking up the rack, but saw no play of enough points to justify not doing so.
>opp: EY 10J YE +29 150
>Chris: DEEINRT 7M TED +23 163
#note ED or TED. I chose TED and the extra 5.

>Chris: ADEINRS D2 RANDIES +73 236
#note One more point on the other side, but both P's are unseen and only one outstanding B. I wanted to give a relatively inexperienced player a lot to think about if he did not have that B

#note *very heavy sigh* - ERS? bingo. 42 with E on post-bingo draw, then ES? bingo while I am drawing 4 consonants to go with the 3 I had. 
>Chris: GGLNNPS 12A GL.N +14 310
#note For me it was GLEN or PING. I wanted as much open as possible.
>opp: ABK G13 KAB +31 370
#note Probably a good reason to have played PING
>Chris: ACGNPST 9K PANG +14 324
#note Setting up a hopeful miracle while playing away the N that would be duplicated on rows 4 for an 8 or row 14's AN if I were to hit there. Tried to imagine BE-words, too.
>opp: HOWY B6 HOW +26 396
#note I do not know Morris' other three letters, but he makes a neat set up here. If I happened to have hit, he, of course, has the Y for a game winning response.
>Chris: ACENSTW 9B E. +12 336
#note Typically, one plays away the W with something like W(ORE) to hinder the Y hook. The best odds were drawing an O. I noted that if I played away the E, that would give me SNOWCAT and if there was *any* word my opponent might miss with perfect knowledge of my rack, that would be the one. If I am hoping for an O, his rack would be AEHOPUY. What I hoped I saw was him then playing YOU and I would win by 13.I did not see the huge play, and even if I did, I would have to hope he missed it to pull out the miracle.
>opp: AEHOPUY A4 HEAPY +92 488
#note Morris saw the huge play, but he wins by more if he blocks me. Understandable though with that monster play. Had I played EH to block HEAPY and he played YUP, I would have lost by 7.So, you just have to give yourself the best shot at winning and, to me, HOWE was it. Had he not known HEAPY and excitedly played YOU, it would have been a 13 point win and the kind of glory over the board that comes along only once in a while, but that is THE reason I play this game.
>Chris: ACNOSTW O9 SNOWCAT +106 442
#note Morris underscored his first play of FIB as 23 so we had the final at 486-446.
>Chris:  (OU) +4 446
