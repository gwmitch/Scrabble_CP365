#note I thought it was not impossible Brett had an A here, as if FEZ was good last turn it is 1 more point. It was clearly just a board vision mistake. On the other hand, an I is pretty unlikely here, otherwise he would've played FIZ the previous turn.

Therefore, I did not want to play something like A(P)OGEE here, he could cash in the Z for a bunch. I didn't play OGEE L2 because of the possibility of FR(O)ZE, but I think that looks fine now. I will often counter that with a high point bingo on row 1 (or even column O). However, I am fine playing it conservatively here. Taking 14 points is very little, but I am grooming my rack while forcing Brett to somehow try to make something happen with his Z for at least 2 turns now. That puts me in a really dominant position.

#note An interesting option here is is (S)TRIDINg 14H, as it blocks most of his bingo options on the lower right side of the board. 10 points is a lot to give up, but that looks worth it.
