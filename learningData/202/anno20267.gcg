#note Whoa, never put together that GIO -> AGIO! GAID#, which I did not know, would play with that for 1 more.

>Matt_Canik: AAIMNOW M7 AWA.O +26 187
#note AMAIN as a 5-overlap at 13A seems sick. Also woohoo!! My first collins words!!

>Dave_Koenig: DINS (challenge) +5 266
#note My first Collins challenge!
>Matt_Canik: ?ILNSVV 7L V.V +9 237
#note Don't know VIN(T)S. That probably warrants consideration. 
>Dave_Koenig: DINS 5E IND...S +40 306
#note I was so upset he played this...
>Matt_Canik: ?DILNRS B1 DIRNdLS +70 307
#note ...because I was going to play it this turn! I decided to play DIRNDLS for literally no reason other than I wanted to play a cooler word than ALDRINS. It's collins - I don't care about my rating and I'm here to socialize, not to pay.

#note Dave said I blocked TOEIEST here
>Matt_Canik: EEHKRUY N12 YEUK +30 337
#note Ugh, I knew KYU was a word but I didn't see it on my rack. G13 is 33 and doesn't give up...
>Dave_Koenig: AEH 15L HA.E +45 378
#note This. 
>Matt_Canik: AEEHLOR F10 H.E +35 372
#note I don't think I can catch him with anything but an outbingo.
>Dave_Koenig: AENPR C9 PAN.ER +22 400
>Matt_Canik: ?AEELOR 15A REsOLE +26 398
#note Which I missed!!! ALE(U)ROnE! Damn. That's sad. I suck. Can't really blank Collins for this one, though knowing TITUPED# would have helped the cause for sure.
