#note Weird looking position.  Based on what was unseen, not many O1 plays could be too damaging.
>Orry: IT O3 IT +20 210
>Joey: DEINQUX D11 INDEX +44 233
#note Conveniently saving QUIT for next turn.  I could also draw a big Q play alongside INDEX.

>Joey: CEOQTUV C9 TOQUE +50 283
>Orry: EFNORRT 5D FRONTER. +72 380
#note I know FRONTER is a word, and the SNORTER anamonic is "a fistfight", so that's plausible yet faulty logic for allowing this.  I assume he would know REFRONTS, and blocking that isn't ideal since I'll probably need that spot.
>Joey: ?CDLORV 2N OD +22 305
#note Setting up a possible bingo ending in CE or CA for very many points, which I could really use.

#note And with that, Orry ties Mark Pistolese for most wins without a loss (4-0) against me.  Congratulations and blah.
