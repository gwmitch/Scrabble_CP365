#note Spent a while debating this or M2 RIDGE. I figured the points was worth being defensively weaker (F/B hook setup, leaving WAVEYS open). But decided that I wanted to give myself a Q spot for next turn, even if it gets blocked a lot of the time.

#note E12 VEG sims ahead of this by 3-4. I'm a little surprised because I figured leaving the E open was going to be important. Really, that E is going to get blocked most of the time anyways. I really should be banking on row 7 for my bingo. And E12 VEG is good for that.

#note AX, AXE, IXORA. I considered IXORA at first, because I figured I would lose to his bingo regardless of whether or not it was an out bingo. But I realized that wasnt necessarily true. I could draw the Z and outrace something like COPARENT, or I could draw my own bingo. But the sim results are clear: emptying the bag is correct here. Give him one less chance to fish for a bingo. But A11 IXORA is not the way to do it. D4 IXORA for 13 fewer points is better. There are almost no endgame racks that outrun me after D4 IXORA and it takes out the best bingo line (through the C). Pre-endgame fail! I lose 13% of a win here.
