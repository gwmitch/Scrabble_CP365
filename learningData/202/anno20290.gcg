>Mina_Le: AELO 8H OLEA +8 8
>Morris_Greenberg: CDEINPX 9H NIXED +30 30
#note I was choosing between NIXED and PIX here. I prefer PIX now because of the better leave, this is a small mistake. The really slick play here is P(OLEA)X, setting up my E and giving me a really nice leave in the process. If I saw that, I would've definitely played it.
>Mina_Le: AEEJ 10E AJEE +30 38
>Morris_Greenberg: ACHIOPV 11B CHIAO +33 63
#note A bunch of interesting options. I prefer this to POACH 11A since it will make it so much easier for her to score next turn with POACH (while I will likely have a tough time the next turn with POACH and a play to the triple). H(A)VOC E9 is another nice option if I want to keep the board more open. I like my play here, but definitely not a clear favorite.
>Mina_Le: ?AALMNU 7B ALUMNAs +63 101
#note I held this for awhile, and was probably 90ish% sure that MANUALs was the only one in there. However, I just didn't feel sure enough to pull the trigger on the challenge for such a low point bingo with the blank and S. This really came back to bite me, I should've trusted my instincts.
>Morris_Greenberg: BFOPVWZ B6 Z.P +34 97
>Mina_Le: ?AEHIIT F1 THIAmI.E +70 171
#note Make that a Z for more style!
>Morris_Greenberg: BDFORVW D4 VRO.W +30 127
#note At the time, I thought this seemed like a no-brainer play, but BOV(I)D 3C and DW(A)RF 4D are definitely worth considering too. BDF is a pretty clunky leave, and this really hurts my chances to bingo on the top left portion of the board. I like DWARF now, it keeps the board more open, and that's what I need here.
>Mina_Le: CITT 2B TITC. +20 191
>Mina_Le: CITT --  -20 171
>Morris_Greenberg: BDFFITY 12F BIFF +28 155
#note I wasn't 100% on BIFFY, that is better. But the real star is BI(T)TY 1D for 39, I just missed it during the game.
>Mina_Le: CGIRTTT -CGITT +0 171
>Morris_Greenberg: DERSSTY J7 S..Y +22 177
#note This is a pretty large mistake. I straight up missed TRYS(T)ED for 45 at 1B. D(EX)Y is also better than this, the S's are pretty valuable on this board compared to other tiles. Crucial error.
>Mina_Le: AADMOR 1D MA.ADOR +39 210
>Morris_Greenberg: DEGGRST 10L EGG +12 189
#note Mina is really starting to pull ahead, so I need to create a higher point bingo lane in order to come back. I chose this over (I)GG G12 because I wanted to keep row 13 available for -EST bingos. But, DERST >>>>>>>>> DRST, so that is better.
>Mina_Le: IQ 2C QI +15 225
#note E3 QI would've really hurt.
>Morris_Greenberg: DORSSTT 13B TRODS +25 214
#note The third really big error....I completely miss 3E D(I)STORTS, and TRODS* is phony! Don't worry, there's a fourth coming this game, I kid you not.
>Mina_Le: AEV H12 .AVE +30 255
>Morris_Greenberg: EGLLPST M10 .LEG +12 226
#note Quackle prefers more fishy plays like G(E)L 15G and GILL 3E slightly. I like this better, keeping lanes open is a priority, and scoring a bit more forces Mina to continue scoring instead of just blocking.
>Mina_Le: BOR A8 ORB +27 282
>Morris_Greenberg: ILOOPST O7 TOPSOIL +86 312
#note Winning percentage up to 60% according to the duck.
>Mina_Le: CNU C10 C.U.N +10 292
>Morris_Greenberg: DIKNRUY 3B KI +34 346
#note I am still not sure of BIFFY, so no J12 YUK. The key here is to unload at least one of the K or Y and score with it. That allows me to outrun any bingo Mina hits. KI accomplishes that exactly, as I'll be up by 54, and if Mina bingos, she'll empty the bag and I can likely go out in 2 to outrun her. YUK accomplishes this slightly better though. Both are about 68% to win according to Quackle.

Quackle also likes (D)INKY a bunch as a block-ier play. It does a very nice job blocking row 2, and rows 3, 4, and 5 through the I, A, and M in THIAmINE. But, it still leaves column N and row 15 open, so it's very risky. Mina's last play suggests she is close to a bingo, I prefer to not try to block everything for her and instead outrun the bingo she will likely hit even if I try blocking.
>Mina_Le: EENRSTU 2I RETUNES +74 366
>Morris_Greenberg: DENRTUY 1L NUDE +32 378
#note So yeah, I completely missed that I had a bingo...U(N)TRENDY M1. The largest error of them all, and quite costly. YURT J12 also wins, but again, I am unsure of BIFFY.

My play forces Mina to know (UN)TWINE for her to win. I wasn't even 100% on it, so I thought I had a decent chance of winning. Still, I don't know how I did not see U(N)TRENDY. I really blew this game multiple times, and it's amazing I was able to stay in it. I eventually sharpened up as the tourney went on, but this was a really sloppy start.
>Mina_Le: EINTW M1 ..TWINE +22 388
#note Well done, Mina!
