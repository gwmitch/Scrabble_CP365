#note unorthodox! against some players I would read this as an X setup.
>JD: HINPRUW 9I WHUP +25 25
#note enjoyed playing paul - fellow basketball junkie
>Paul_Erland: ENOT 10I NOTE +25 47
#note he took quite awhile to make this play.

#note counted as 26
>JD: CDIILLO 10D LID +24 123
#note I was thinking of IDOLIC* looking at my rack but didn't find the spot for EIDOLIC. the trouble with LID is that some of the value is conditional on me playing JARL next turn, when I would really prefer not to open the snapback of JARLS.

#note a decent idea normally, but there's actually not that many great spots for the Z on this board, and the board is very open - hence the sim prefers playing the Z now with GONZO or OOZED

>JD: AEGOOPT 7L POO +22 288
#note I couldn't find a play that turned over as many tiles as I wanted - APOLOG looks good but then he can play APOLOGIZE!! quackle's favorite is POMO because his response of ZIN would give me a big comeback. I think I like OMEGA through the M.
>Paul_Erland: CEIINZ 11B ZE.N +32 249
#note the problem with this play is that it gives back POON, which I thought was CSW!!! oops. lucky me

#note worth burning an S to block and see an extra tile? I think yeah...
>Paul_Erland: EIRTT O11 TRITE +26 292
>JD: EEINOQW F2 WE +28 373
#note should turn over more tiles and hope that one of the blanks is in the bag - he was getting quite low on time so I made this play fast, but WOMEN looks better.
>Paul_Erland: AMX C13 MAX +36 328
#note ooh did he miss EXAM?
>JD: ?EINOOQ M1 Q. +11 384
#note after an agonizing time quackle is convinced that I need to play OX at 15B, which seems absolutely insane. this seems like one of the hardest pre-endgames I've ever seen. I can draw into huge Q plays by drawing the A or U, but it felt like I would win if he bingoed by then playing through the X, that I would outrun him if he played through the X himself first, and that X bingos were not that likely.
>Paul_Erland: ?ADERSS 15H DRESSAg. +77 405
#note quackle thinks he wins every endgame by playing QIS, but in reality I can probably block everything unless he draws an X bingo.
