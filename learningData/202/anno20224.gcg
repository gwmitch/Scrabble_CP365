>Florence_Spanfelner: ABEIRRZ 8D BRAZIER +92 92
#note Intimidating open as it was, but she actually missed BIZARRE for 106

>Marty: AHILOOU G6 OU.O +15 15
#note Quackle likes this.
>Florence_Spanfelner: EGGJR 6F J.GGER +33 125
>Marty: ADHILNU 5J HAUL +23 38
#note Quackle says HADING at H1. Wouldn't have thought of it. HAUL was the foruth choice.
>Florence_Spanfelner: AEFT 4H FATE +20 145
>Marty: DEGIINS E8 .ESIDING +70 108
#note Could have gotten 7 more pts for 10A DINGIES. I saw that word, but wasn't sure about it and very quickly found (R)ESIDING anyway
>Florence_Spanfelner: IPRY 15E .RIPY +33 178
#note I briefly held but let it go. It's good.
>Marty: ACCDLMW 3K WAD +21 129
#note Quackle likes CWM at N3 for 20. Never thought about the M hook off of HAUL. Leaves a much better leave (CLAD)
>Florence_Spanfelner: ?BDILMS 11D M.SBuILD +74 252
>Marty: CDLMNNV -  +0 129
#note I challenged MISBUILD. At this point, if this play stands, I'm losing anyway, so what the hell. I guess I'm not as solid on my 23000-24000 8s as I thought.
>Florence_Spanfelner: HO 3H OH +23 275
>Marty: CDLMNNV -CLDVNN +0 129
#note I couldn't think of any other options, and Quackle doesn't give any. With all of the vowels that were out there, I figured I'd hang onto one tile. Quackle likes holding CN. Holding the M alone is its 11th choice.
>Florence_Spanfelner: ?AIORSU N5 SAUtOIR +68 343
#note Well now she's just running up the score.
>Marty: AELMOVX O7 MAX +52 181
#note At least I'll make it respectable.
>Florence_Spanfelner: DEFIY O11 EDIFY +44 387
#note Or maybe not.
>Marty: EELOSVW 12A VOWE. +40 221
#note Then again...
>Florence_Spanfelner: CEIKO B10 CO.KIE +36 423
#note She's just on fire. I can't stop her.
>Marty: EEELNST G2 EN +10 231
#note Not that it would have changed the outcome, but missed M9 STELENE (which I didn't know). Quackle hates my play, but I'm just trying to open anything.
>Florence_Spanfelner: NPTU 1G PUNT +23 446
#note Which she abruptly closes. I'm also trying to keep out of the bottom right, which may be a last chance to bingo, starting at M9.
>Marty: AEELSTT 15A T.E +9 240
#note C12 WAT would have been better and served the same purpose for 26. 
>Florence_Spanfelner: INTT 2L NITT +13 459
>Florence_Spanfelner: INTT --  -13 446
#note She wasn't trying to get away with anything, it was one of those mistakes where as soon as she hit her clock, she realized she meant to do something else.
>Marty: AAEELST 10A A.E +5 245
#note Quackle likes N13 AE for 16, which I was considering, but trying to keep the one somewhat plausible bingo lane open.
>Florence_Spanfelner: LTT 13D T.LT +10 456
>Marty: AAEELST N2 AE +12 257
#note And of course I fish and pick the exact same two bloody letters, so I have to fish again.
>Florence_Spanfelner: V 9M V.. +17 473
#note So much for my bingo lane :(
>Marty: AEILOST A4 SOLATI. +24 281
#note Finally, I have ISOLATE! With a completely closed board. Maybe I can stick her with the Q. Oh no wait, there are two places she can play it off. All right, let's just end this. (Quackle likes L10 OSTEAL for 27, but my play is its second choice.)
>Florence_Spanfelner: CNNNOQR 1L CONN +30 503
>Marty: E 14N E. +10 291
#note Ha! I'll take the 20 for the Q afer all! (SAUtOIR)E for the same 10 would have been cuter.


>Marty:  (NQR) +24 315
#note All in all, only one missed bingo, which was after the game was decided anyway, one bad challenge which I don't feel too bad about, and some stupid fishing plays at the end which were desperation moves. She was on fire and played really well, and I just can't feel bad about that.
