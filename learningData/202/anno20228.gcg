>Marty_Gold: BCDIOOW 9K BOW +18 44
>Flora_Taylor: ?DGIINV 9B DrIVING +69 97
#note VoIDING would have also worked for the same points. She made a scoring error here and counted this at 70.
>Marty_Gold: CDEILOZ 8A DOE +16 60
#note F9 (I)DOLIZE or F5 IDOLI(I)ZE would have been 41. I was fixated on ZOIC in my rack, and didn't find a cool place to play it. In retrosepct, this was a really poor move, since it closed the board a little. Quackle does not like it. My only rationale is that it defended against a big play at 8A-D.
>Flora_Taylor: ?EKORRS N3 cORKERS +79 176
#note This was a really nice choice to neutralize the top right corner. Kudos to her.
>Marty_Gold: BCEILNZ 4L BL.C +22 82
#note Quackle prefers F8 B(I)Z for 34, which makes more sense that my play, which was the fifth choice.
>Flora_Taylor: OTWY 5I TOWY +27 203
>Marty_Gold: AEIINTZ M9 .IZEN +34 116
#note Quackle prefers 10J ZA for 36. Interesting it likes the two EIINT leave over an AIT leave.

Here's where my DOE comes back to bite me. If I had left that part of the board alone, I could have T(r)IAZINE at C8. D'oh.
>Flora_Taylor: JTU 12J JUT. +22 225
>Marty_Gold: AAAEIQT K11 Q.A +24 140
#note Quackle's third choice. It would have plunked down the I there for Q(U)AI and two more pts. 
>Flora_Taylor: DEINORS A1 INDORSE. +83 308
#note No shortage of good choices for her, and now the game's pretty much over.
>Marty_Gold: AAAEIST 10B AA +12 152
#note Quackle's second choice. It like N11 ASEA for 33. But it likes my leave a lot. Championship player actually does give my play the first choice, but my win % is down to 0.47%.
>Flora_Taylor: FGU 4H FUG +16 324
>Marty_Gold: AEEINST E6 NAI.ETES +72 224
#note 09 ETESIAN would have been 84. Did not think of the E hook off of BOWS. I'm up to a 0.73% win prob.
>Flora_Taylor: EOUY 13B YOU.E +16 340
#note This was another really nice shut the board down play.
>Marty_Gold: EGLNSTT F8 T.L +11 235
#note Quackle likes 14K GEST for 42. Championship player likes C12 T(O)NG for 5. My play is 10th.
>Flora_Taylor: AEIMV D2 MAVIE +22 362
>Marty_Gold: EGHNPST D12 H.P +26 261
#note Quackle and Championship player like D12 P(U)GH for 36. Quackle thinks my play is OK, CP does not.
>Flora_Taylor: DHIN 14F HIND +29 391
>Marty_Gold: ACEGNST H12 CA.T +27 288
#note Quackle likes 14K GAST for 42, but my play is 4th. Championship player likes 14K GAS for 36.
>Flora_Taylor: EILOR 15H .OILER +10 401
#note This empties the bag and does what it needs to do.
>Marty_Gold: EEGNPRS C1 REP +22 310
#note O7 NEEPS would have been 39. Once again, didn't see the E hook. 
>Flora_Taylor: AORTU B13 .OU +12 413
>Marty_Gold: EGNS F3 ENGS +12 322
#note Same word at O9 would have 4 more.
>Marty_Gold:  (ART) +6 328
#note Flora went ahead early and nicely closed the board down. DOE was a stupid play on my part, but other than that, I just couldn't recover from her back-to-back bingoes. So, lunchtime and I'm 2-2.
