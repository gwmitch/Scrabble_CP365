>Alec_Sjoholm: DLOUW 8D WOULD +26 26
#note I knew this game wouldn't be as easy as our previous encounter.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEGIIMT E4 IMAG. +16 16
#note This or AMIG(O) to my surprise is recommended by Q.
>Alec_Sjoholm: IO F5 OI +12 38
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEFIRT D1 FIAT +26 42
#note Agreed...while FA(G) is a nice option too.

>Alec_Sjoholm: ACELSUX 9H EXCUSAL +78 116
#note I didn't even hold here. Phony. FAXES and CAUDEXES---
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABEEMRW 1D .ERBAM +39 81
#note MEW 8M is better, a play I was mostly set on but at the last moment I decided on this.
>Alec_Sjoholm: ADEINPT 2H DEPAINT +89 205
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEIKNOW 1L KOAN +54 135
#note KAIN is slightly preferred.
>Alec_Sjoholm: AEGOORT 10B ROOTAGE +66 271
#note (DE)ROGATE is pretty snazzy.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?EFIORW L5 FROW.IEr +84 219
#note I was held here.


>Alec_Sjoholm: EILN 3I LIEN +22 293
>Gunther_Jacobi: ILNOQRU N6 QUI.L +36 255
#note Forgot QUOLL in the same spot which is 2pts better.
>Alec_Sjoholm: IRSZ C9 Z.RIS +48 341
>Gunther_Jacobi: ACNNORV 2A COV.N +22 277
#note Q prefers VA(I)N which I don't like. My play creates a tangible threat while keeping rows 12 and 13 unobstructed.
>Alec_Sjoholm: PSU A1 S.UP +33 374
>Gunther_Jacobi: AGINRTT 13C .TARTING +59 336
>Alec_Sjoholm: BEV H12 V.BE +39 413
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEELNY 5I LEA.Y +22 358
#note This play is perhaps the right idea, as far as playing off 4 while not playing near row 15, but YA(U)LD is the correct way to do it. It scores 14 more and blocks his strongest play.
>Alec_Sjoholm: JOSY 11J JO.YS +45 458
>Gunther_Jacobi: DDEEHNR G3 HERD +17 375
#note With just seconds left on my clock I miss strong plays from 8L.
>Alec_Sjoholm: EEHT 6J HE. +29 487
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEN B4 END +12 387
#note While Quackling this game it wouldn't allow me to make the L in EXCUSAL a blank for some reason so you'll find there's 5 actual L's on this board. Also, we had the final scored at 487-396.
