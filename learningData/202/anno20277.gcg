#note The only other play I considered was DIGHT and it took me a while to choose between the two. The deciding factor for me was my rack and Orry's opening with an exchange 2.  He's going to bingo and a bingo on column J will score almost as much as a 2x2 on row 11.  Sooooo, I thought it was best to play short, not long.  I could dump this rack through one of his vowels next turn.  BEDIGHT is best case scenario.  Or rather, BEDIGHTS :D

>Tasha: ADEIMOS 4K MEDIA +38 249
#note I played MEDIA over MODI because MEDIA gives me more of a chance to open the board if Orry makes a blocking play on row 3.

#note What's the fun in playing the bingo for less points?  Orry doesn't have any high point tiles on his rack so I'm not afraid of being blown up on row 1.  It's much more likely he's going to bingo on row 3.

#note About ten seconds after hitting my clock, I mumble "Maybe it was better to switch the F and N."  About ten seconds after that I realize that FAIN is better defensively.  Orry definitely has the blank at this point, and I prefer him to bingo to the N on row 4 than on row 1.
>Orry_Swift: T M4 ...T +9 295
#note Yup, he's definitely sitting on Mr. Blankie.

#note I don't care what Quackle says.  Any play that doesn't take out rows 3 and 4 is wrong.

>Tasha: ?ACCENY 14L A.C +15 394
#note OMG I JUST DREW THE BLANK!!!!  HE DIDN"T HAVE IT THE WHOLE TIME!!! HE THOUGHT I HAD IT!!!! Oh damn I like C12 PITY.  Blocks the inevitable play at 15A.  I was too busy worrying about unduplicating my C's that I failed to see the big picture.  I also wanted to play off two tiles instead of one to let him empty the bag.

#note I'm blocking SANTERIF*  
>Orry_Swift: AEINRST 15A IS +24 346
#note Here is when I realized that SANTERIF* isn't even good.    About ten seconds after my realization, I realized that perhaps Orry was fishing for the blank for1A SANSERIF.  Then as I was waiting in between games, I realized that that's not quite right as I didn't throw the F down on row 1 until turn 11 so around turn 12 or so Orry's only hope to win the game was to pray that I didn't have the blank and he'll draw it for SANSERIF for 83.  Then as I was eating dinner later that day, I realized I should have realized what Orry's plan was as looking out for possible bingos is something I'm actually good at.  I should have played OF or something instead of OI on turn 13 to take out the biggest threat.  Then as I was about to fall asleep, I realized that the only SURE win was bingoing out with SANSERIF.  If he had drawn the blank and bingoed after I played OI, he would have to pray that the right tiles were in the bag.   After this realization, I fell alseep because all this is moot because I drew the blank AND I wouldn't have let him bingo out anyways!
>Tasha: ?CENVY 4D CoV.. +18 419
#note Okay, I didn't jack up this last play as much as I thought I did.  I mean I jacked it up because I gave him an outplay, but this is the silver medalist.  It doesn't have a valuation of -60 like my usual endgame plays.
>Orry_Swift: AENRT D2 RE.ANT +8 354
>Orry_Swift:  (ENY) +12 366
#note ....When I woke up the next morning, it occured to me that maybe Orry wasn't fishing for SANSERIF after all.  He was surprised when I told him I didn't have the blank until after I played OI.  :)
