#note Quackle slightly prefers playing OVEN for 10. I am fine with this, but I think I might have been a bit influenced from my previous game to avoid a bad leave to start the game as much as possible. If I were less biased, I might have played through it.
>Paula_Catanese: HIIL 9F HILI +24 30
>Morris_Greenberg: ?CEHNRU 6H CHURNEd +78 100
#note I missed the C(HILI) hook. pUNCHER E6 looks better.

>Morris_Greenberg: ACEELLN N3 CAN.ELLE +61 202
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEELLN --  -61 141
#note I knew this was phony. I did not know NACELLE 10I...awkward. Paula held this for over 5 minutes before making the correct call.
>Paula_Catanese: IIRZ D10 .IZIR +34 149
>Morris_Greenberg: ACEELLN 4C ANELE +16 157
#note This was a bad play, I think I was a bit distracted from thinking I was going to get away with CANDELLE and then not. Obviously NACELLE, but 11B AN(I)LE looks much better, as well as ENLACE 8I and ENLAC(E) E5.

>Morris_Greenberg: CILRTUW C3 C.W +29 186
#note UR(A)TIC is a bit better.
>Paula_Catanese: AOVY 14A OVA.Y +22 211
>Morris_Greenberg: BILORTU B10 .UB +8 194
#note ORBIT or OBIT 15E are better, I should go for points, this is pretty weak. At the time, I thought I needed a bingo to catch up, but this was probably a bit premature of a fish.

#note I drew AAA first and thought this wasn't going to be pretty. Then I got bailed out. Scrabble is a weird game.
>Paula_Catanese: GOW 15M WOG +28 308
>Morris_Greenberg: DDEGMST H1 ME.D +36 389
#note MEDS (or MEGS or GEMS) 9K is a bit better than this for winning percentage, but this will net more spread on average. I would probably play one of those now.

#note N(E) K2 to block my high point out.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEES 1K DEE.S +27 448
#note Definitely got lucky here, that post bingo draw was nice. This was a sloppy win.
