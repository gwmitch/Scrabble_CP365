>Morris_Greenberg: BBEJLNT 8D BLENT +20 20
#note Tough choice between BLENT, BLEB, and exchanging. I hate leaving such a clunky leave against a better player, so maybe exchanging is the was to go here.
>Eric_Tran: AGOTU F3 OUTAG. +9 9
>Morris_Greenberg: BDEJRVV 6E V.V +9 29
#note I wasn't 100% on VARVED. But, I should probably just exchange and hope to bingo than try to clutter up the board like I did here.
>Eric_Tran: ATX G1 TAX +35 44
>Morris_Greenberg: BDEJNRR 3C RED.. +26 55
#note I had a tough time choosing between (T)REND 1G and RED(OX). I decided to take the points. However, on such a tight board, closing down the main scoring spot should be a priority. Not to mention that it gets rid of another consonant, which I need to do. I would definitely play TREND if I did this again.
>Eric_Tran: AGTU 1D GUT.A +24 68
>Morris_Greenberg: BEJNRRU 2G .BJURE +21 76
#note I sort of hated making this play, but didn't see anything else really reasonable. Quackle suggests (G)R(E)BE, which I missed.
>Eric_Tran: HMOW 1L WHOM +57 125
>Morris_Greenberg: ALLNRUY D8 .ULLY +20 96
#note (O)RALLY is also an option here.
>Eric_Tran: ACDHORR 9H ORCHARD +67 192
>Morris_Greenberg: AILNPRS 8L PAIL +39 135
#note Gah, I missed SPAN(D)RIL. I needed that bailout.
>Eric_Tran: AEE 10C A.EE +6 198
>Morris_Greenberg: ?INORSS O1 .ISeNRO.S +74 209
#note I wasn't sure of S(H)ORINGS, but I like this better anyways. Why open up the triple like that for a measly 3 points?
>Eric_Tran: ?ADEIOS 5H SEDAtIO. +66 264
>Morris_Greenberg: EEFIIIN K9 .EINIE +18 227
#note The nice play I missed was E(D)IFI(C)E J4. That doesn't do...
>Eric_Tran: EIIMRST 15I MISTIER +90 354
#note ...what HEINIE did.
>Morris_Greenberg: EFFGITY 12G EFFI.G +34 261
>Morris_Greenberg: EFFGITY --  -34 227
#note On the shuttle from the airport, Seth and I were studying words, and we at one point looked at the ?AFFING patterned words (It's the consonants in BODY GOWN if you care). I could've sworn he said AFFING* means EFFING*. I guess I am just hearing crazy things, no big deal.

Within seconds after Eric challenging this off, I saw the star play this turn: EFF(I)GY! My chances were bleak, but man, I shot myself in the foot there.
>Eric_Tran: ACP 14H CAP. +28 382
>Morris_Greenberg: EFFGITY 4I FIFE +35 262
#note Maybe FIEF 4A?
