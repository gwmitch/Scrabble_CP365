#note The only bingo.  Almost worth playing something like RAG 7G and waiting for a better one, but it's never guaranteed.

#note Looking back, I'm glad I played my bingo when I did.
>Alyssa: DEINPST 6B STIPEND +67 170
>Joey: AACIMRT E3 CAM. +20 209
#note One of many mediocre options available.  MAC I9 gives back too many easy comebacks.  MA keeps a stronger leave but messes up this area.  CAMP seems fine.
>Alyssa: AFNU N2 UNFA... +40 210
>Joey: AEIIRST B6 .ATIRISE +60 269
#note Bingos are never a bad thing (especially when they're mine), but they were pretty dangerous this game.

#note The Q alert was pretty deafening, so ATAP 1A was no longer viable.
>Alyssa: EIOV A1 O.IVE +36 379
>Joey: AENQSTU 11G QUEST +41 404
#note Guess that Q alert was a false one.  I thought this was better than SQUAT because AN seemed a tad more flexible for whatever the last tile was.
>Alyssa: AEHKNOY 1F HOKY +48 427
>Alyssa: AEHKNOY --  -48 379
#note The best she can do is HAKE A7, which ties.  I'm glad I had to challenge because I usually think this is a word.
>Joey: ANO K9 NO.A +11 415
#note Missing LOAN O2 for four more points.  I sure hope I would have found that if she had played HAKE!
