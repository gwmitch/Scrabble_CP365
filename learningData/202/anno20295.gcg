>Jonathan_Lindh: AMMNQRU 8G MM +12 12
#note Strange Beginnings: A Quackle Case Study on Leave. MM sims better than QUA despite scoring 12 to QUA's 24 points. Quackle really likes the QUARN balanced leave even though it normally hates the Q on the rack. This MM is best at 19.1 points to QUA's 16.2 points. The other MM is second best and sims and point less or so.
>New_Player_1: FOOOOOP 9F POOF +23 23
#note Should Tim have played POOF on top of MM? In retrospect yes, but he had no way of knowing what I had. Both POOFs sim equally.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AANQRSU J5 AQUAS +44 56
#note I like this play but QUASAR B10 or QUASAR J6 are better. Quackle likes AQUA I10 best but I don't like that play because of hooks onto AQUA.
>New_Player_1: EHOOOUU K5 TI +19 42
>Jonathan_Lindh: CNNRRRZ -CZRNN +0 56
#note I kept RN.  Quackle says keep RZ or NZ. Another time Quackle favors a high consonant leave.
>New_Player_1: EHOOOUU L2 FIVES +37 79
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AKLNRW 3K W.NK +22 78
#note Quackle says this is 3rd best; I thought this ended up being the best play. 10E LAWN for 28 points keeps a K making it hard to bingo. H8 MOoNWALK for 60 points is best but is VERY hard to spot and burns a blank. I like my sequence better since it scores 22 points, gives a great leave and opens a bingo lane with my blank in tow.
>New_Player_1: HIOOOUU N1 DA. +16 95
#note Tim maybe on to me and he's trying to shut my newly created lane down. Unfortunately for him...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AACELR O3 sCALARE +94 172
#note Best play! I almost chickened out on it, but went ahead and did it. Between this and the CORNIER/TOGGLER play against Doug I burned a LOT of time on bingos that I quickly saw but wasn't sure on. Tim held but wisely didn't challenge.
>New_Player_1: HIOOOUU 1M A.Z +39 134
>Jonathan_Lindh: CJNNNOW 7I J.N +21 193
#note Best play! This was a terrible rack but I made the best of it for a whopping 21 points and 11.3 equity points. A year ago, I would have unwisely exchanged. Now I look for the checkdown play.
>New_Player_1: HIOOOUU N9 OX +27 161
#note This may score 27, but with a blank, 3 O's, and a Y out is this the best play for Tim? I'm not so sure.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDNNORW M9 WON +29 222
#note 2nd best play! WORN was the best in same spot and replace an N with an E I have CROWNED for the bingo. I didn't see WORN for some reason. WORN reduces comeback places in L column involving front hooks of OX. WON leaves one too many consonants.
>New_Player_1: HIOOOUU L10 PIG +26 187
#note This would not have happened had I played WORN. I think. This play was underscored by 2 points. Recorded as 24 points but really 26. I underscored my plays by 12 before Tim and I caught my math errors. We didn't catch his unfortunately.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDGNNRU I2 CURD +13 235
#note DUNG and GATE in same spot for12 points is best because of CNR leave as opposed to NNG leave. My highest scoring play here is I3 CUD for 14 points which I saw. The power of the leave!
>New_Player_1: EHOOOUU K11 HALL +29 216
#note Decently high scoring play...but there are 2 S's, a blank, and an O out. I had the O too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGINNOR 15K ORANG +29 264
#note I had the right idea. Quackle likes GIRON 15H for same score. AN is preferred to IN due to one A left in pool as opposed to 5 I's. ORANG anagrams include ARGON and ORGAN. All sim the same at 29.5. G10 ON and NO are tied with best with GIRON as well at 30.2 equity points but I don't like those plays leaving H row open and burning the O.
>New_Player_1: EOOOSUU E4 SEARISE +75 291
>New_Player_1: EOOOSUU --  -75 216
#note California's own Gary Moss attempted SEALION* in a game and had it challenged off and this one goes too. It's a good thing I plugged the H row. No bingos in this rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIILNOT 2B NEOLITI. +74 338
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIILNOT --  -74 264
#note Now I have my own bingo challenged off. Nothing in this rack.
>New_Player_1: EOOSTUU E9 SAE +17 233
#note Why not SEA?
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIILNOT 10E .IN +16 280
#note A10 TOENAIL is what Quackle likes but I think this opens the board too much and I know he has a S and possibly a blank. My play doesn't sim but I like it anyway.
>New_Player_1: OORTUUV N13 GU. +8 241
>Jonathan_Lindh: EETY J11 TYEE +29 309
#note Don't know my rack but this scored well and I didn't see anything that scored anywhere close to 29 points.
>New_Player_1: EOORTUV D11 BEE +14 255
#note Tim opening bingo lanes. Smart move.
>Jonathan_Lindh: IILR 14B LIRI +14 323
#note My studying of the fours is paying off. Shutting down that spot as much as possible.
>New_Player_1: EOORTUV 15A YO +17 272
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEIOTT 15E DOTE +18 341
#note 4th best play. DOIT for 18 points in same spot is top play but I chickened out on DOIT. I like keeping the I for bingos that end in -IC in row 2. I had the right idea though. If only DOTTIER played.
>New_Player_1: DEIRSTU 4B STURDIE. +70 342
#note Nice play by Tim. This was his only bingo available that he could play. Still has a chance. Now watch this crazy endgame!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEHITT 13C H.BE +34 375
#note 4th best play. 2nd through 5=4th best plays all play in 13th row where I played. BEHEST, BERTH, HEBES, and HEBE all go here so once again I had the right idea. However, I missed BaTHETIC 2B in the 2nd row off of the C for 82 points. I knew this word but I whiffed and I was under time pressure. I was under 30 seconds when I played HEBE so I had an excuse. Wuld have won 453-342 and would have been scored as 453-340 due to scoring error. Bad mistake. But get this...
>New_Player_1: EEINORV 2E EVIN.E +21 363
#note Tim makes the 6th best play in EVINCE but misses a bingo in the same spot where I missed my bingo! His was 2C OVERNI(C)E. I knew this word but I don't know if I could have found it under my time pressure. Maybe yes maybe no. Time to get ride of my letters VERY QUICKLY!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ITT B4 .TInT +6 381
#note TERRITS OR TETRIS on E1 for 10 points. TETRIS I didn't even know. However, it was just good to get my tiles down, make an outplay and designate the blank within 5-6 seconds. I finished with 7 seconds on my clock. This wasn't my best endgame, but it was good enough to win! Final score recorded as 385-361. Correct score is 385-363.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (OR) +4 385
#note Strange Beginnings: A case study on how Quackle values leave. Despite MM scoring 12 and QUA scoring 24, MM sims better on equity points by 19.1 to 16.2. The other placement of MM with the beginning M on the double word score sims slightly less as well.
