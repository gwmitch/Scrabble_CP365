#note Steve considered 10B ZIP 34, but couldn't pass up on the big score of L1 ZEALS 52. After all, it put him up over 100 points on a board with no real bingo lanes. How could it go wrong? 
>moh: ?GHIKOS 1L .IG +13 267
#note The 'obvious' play is 1L (Z)IGS 42, but once I did the math, I realized it was an obvious loser. After ZIGS, I'm down 60, and it's easy for my opp to block the bingos down columns N and O. So, holding the last S and a blank, I decided to set up a huge comeback spot. In the worst-case scenario, opp blocks the big plays down the O column and I settle for ZIGS next play. But there's a huge upside if my opp has to settle for a partial block (or maybe none at all).

#note My opponent understandably wanted to prevent a big play from ZIG, so he thought he's throw a wrench in my plans for a bingo from the corner.

#note Yahooooooo!

#note Steve was a great sport given that he'd just endured my biggest play ever, and a late comeback to boot. Thanks for not spoiling the moment, Steve.
