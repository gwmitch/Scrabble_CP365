#note I don't know (PYRROL)E. Missed 14B TEETH.

>Quackle: GINNRWY 6K WYN +15 101
>Tunnicliffe: DEEHITT N1 TITHED +43 251
#note Missed 14B TEETH again.
>Quackle: ?AFGINR 1H INGRAF.s +158 259
#note See, this wouldn't have happened to a player who knows PYRROLE. Morale of the story...?
>Tunnicliffe: ?AEKMOO 4K OKE. +22 273
#note Quackle prefers L3 OAKY/OKAY. I dunno. I wasn't crazy about unloading my E, but they were still plentiful. I liked that OKEH opened a bingo lane for me.
>Quackle: AEIJOOT 14A JOE +32 291
#note Putting my ignorance out of its misery.
>Tunnicliffe: ?AEMNOT 15A OM +43 316
#note Passing up the bingoes seemed obvious. Didn't work out as planned, however.
>Quackle: ACDIORT 2B CAROTID +77 368
>Tunnicliffe: ?AENOTW 3C WEN +26 342
#note Again discarding the E maybe a bit too eagerly. Quackle's choice strikes me as insane: F12 MOW. Yikes... I'm not sure, but it does seem to win the sim decisively. Other moves include (WIN)NOW and W(R)OTE.

#note Big brain fart missing IVIES.
>Quackle: AAELLOR 5G AL +6 427
#note Try to find the only win for me.
>Tunnicliffe: AHIPSUV M9 SPAHI +39 502
#note Not too difficult, but happy not to miss it.
>Quackle: AEELORS 6A AREOLES +64 491
#note Not this time, Quackle. Not this time.
