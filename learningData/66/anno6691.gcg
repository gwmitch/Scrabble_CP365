#note Marlon turned some tiles down as if to trade for a third time and said something along the lines of "I could give you trouble if I didn't have to trade all the time!"  But then he changed his mind and made a play.

#note A tricky situation.  OHIA M12 is the play that screams to be made by this rack, but it is completely inappropriate in this game situation.  I considered AIOLI, but the points for AHI are too good to pass up.  With a lucky draw, the rack could improve in a hurry.  Otherwise, I'm still not in bad shape if I have to spend a turn grooming the rack.

#note And Marlon is right back in the game, though I still like my chances with the last blank.

#note I think it's important not to fall too in love with the bingo here.  I've got ways to score and the tempo.  Of course, I'd like to bingo, but I'd also like to maintain the lead so that I can win even without bingoing.  Usually I'd rather keep MN than MT, but there are still two N's remaining.

#note This play clinches it.  Marlon told me afterward that I blocked JAWAN.  At this point, Marlon took a long think and exposited about his bad luck: "This was too good a game to end this way.  You're gonna baby bingo out, because I picked up everything that could stop you."

>Dave: ?DEOPRT F7 E..T +13 429
#note A bizarre moment of blindness by me.  There are two playable bingos here, ADOPTER and DEPICTOR.  What's even weirder is that I saw ADOPTER and wrote it on my scoresheet, but somehow missed the spot for it.  I was more caught up on playing to the C.  I wrote down the alphagrams for CDEOPRT plus each of the five vowels, but failed to find DEPICTOR.  Of course, these are easy words that I would have played without hesitation if I had seen them.  However, in this situation if you're less than 100% sure of a bingo, it's a good idea to forgo it, because it's easy to win with an out in two.  A phony is one of the few ways to blow it.
