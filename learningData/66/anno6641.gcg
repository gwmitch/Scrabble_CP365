>Jeff: EEEHIRR 8D HIREE +24 24
>Jane: INW 9C WIN +17 17
>Jeff: AEEORTW 7G WORE +23 47
#note First mistakes:  saving AET instead of AERT (it's early), and putting an E under a TWS needlessly.
>Jane: ANV 6H VAN +20 37
>Jeff: AAEFGNT K3 FANG +24 71
#note Same mistake. I actually saw 5I FANEGA but didn't want to open the triple lane.
>Jane: AEENRST 10E NEAREST +64 101
#note Lucky for me she chose the lowest scoring bingo/placement.
>Jeff: ADENTUY 9I YAUD +25 96
#note I get back to thinking about leave here. L3 AY or L1 YUAN sim highest.
>Jane: MPV 4J V.MP +22 123
>Jeff: ABDENRT 8K BARED +36 132
#note seeing BARTEND would have been helpful. at least I chose the next best option.
>Jane: ORU 3K .OUR +26 149
>Jeff: EINOTTY 11K TONY +26 158
#note I've seen VAMPY but not enough times to see the best plays here.
>Jane: EOPS O1 POSE +29 178
>Jeff: EEGHIOT 12K EH +27 185
#note Don't even see the R over the TWS, in my usual fashion. RIGHTO.
>Jane: IJ 5I JI. +27 205
>Jeff: EGIIOTZ N10 Z.GOTE +78 263
#note At least I didn't miss this one.
>Jane: DIT 15L DI.T +21 226
>Jeff: BGIILOS 11C BIS +18 281
#note Dismal! I think I justified this by thinking I'd be able to use the O front hook. Better to keep the S and play 7M OBI. Didn't know 13J ISOLOG.
>Jane: IKO 14J KOI +20 246
>Jeff: EGILLOQ 7B LEG +12 293
#note Ugh. I remembered OBIS and forgot IBIS. B10 QI would also block the T(WIN) hook. I'm starting to think she has a blank, and though about 15I QI, but that opens up S(KI).
>Jane: AIR 15H RAI +15 261
>Jeff: CILMOQS 8A QI +35 328
#note Now I really wish I'd seen the other placement...
>Jane: ??EILTU A8 .UILTErs +98 359
#note If I hadn't opened that spot up, she would have scored 32 points less on her bingo.
>Jeff: ACFLMOS 12C OF +24 352
>Jane: CEU 14F CUE +13 372
>Jeff: AACLMNS 13C AS +20 372
#note L(UP)ANA(R)S anyone? Apparently there are a few ways to win. My way was not one of them.
>Jane: ADLOTX N5 AXL. +27 399
