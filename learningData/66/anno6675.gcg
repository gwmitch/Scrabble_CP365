#note q likes (O)VEN or n13 PEN.  there are a few other plays all really bunched. i'm not sure what's best here - my thought is that my play gets rid of the V whilst keeping an L for the FOUL hook and also not blocking potential bingo lanes.  It also creates a volatile X spot which i may need being behind so much

#note adam's previous play blocked PINELIKE, SKIPLANE, SPRINKLE and KEPHALIN.  I passed up the 7 extra points of 11j KEP to open up a new line.

#note N1 VIM(E)N is the best play by a mile and i missed it. I liked this as it kept VLI and gave me a chance to hit VEXIL along the bottom.  I should've found VIMEN and if i had i would surely have gone with it.
