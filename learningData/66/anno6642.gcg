#note Again, I'm good at picking the top sim on my first turn. After that, forget it.
>Mona: HO 9G OH +16 16
>Jeff: AAGIOTT 10A AGITATO +69 81
#note Yay, I didn't miss it!
>Mona: AGUV A6 GUAV. +27 43
#note 3 more points at A8...
>Jeff: AEEEIIY -AEEIIY +0 81
#note Boo! Top sims other than mine keep A or EY? Strange.
>Mona: AMN 11E NAM +24 67
#note MAN for 2 more.
>Jeff: AEEILPR 12D RAP +18 99
#note Another duh moment, brought to you by... me.
>Mona: LOO I6 LO.O +14 81
>Jeff: ADEIILO J2 OIDIA +14 113
#note This is why you shouldn't play off two of your three consonants with a three letter word. Knew EIDOLA, didn't see it. At least I'm still ahead.
>Mona: ?CEINRT K6 CERTaIN +71 152
#note Doh!
>Jeff: EEJLNTY 10J J.Y +28 141
#note Should have taken the time to find the higher scoring J plays here.
>Mona: ADLR 13E LARD +16 168
>Jeff: EEEILNT L2 ELITE +16 157
#note One of those moments where I'm not sure if I should try and turn over tiles or score less keep the good ones. How about scoring less and turning over?
>Mona: DIR M2 RID +17 185
>Jeff: BEINNQV I3 QI +45 202
>Mona: IK H4 KI +24 209
>Jeff: BEENNNV 5D BENN. +14 216
#note Knew I needed to get rid of some Ns in order to keep out of trouble.
>Mona: AWW 4C WAW +31 240
>Jeff: AEEFNPV 3B VANE +35 251
#note The front hook for ELITE would have been nice to know.
>Mona: DU H13 .UD +15 255
#note Blank alert..
>Jeff: EEFPSUX 9C XU +36 287
>Mona: ERS N2 RES +19 274
>Jeff: EEEFPST 8K .EEFS +27 314
#note Got greedy, even though I thought she had a blank. M10 STEEP scores the same and doesn't open up an extra lane. Though she probably would have played through the D anyway.
>Mona: EO 1N OE +10 284
>Jeff: EHLNPTZ C12 THEN +20 334
#note Again, if I hadn't opened up the O lane, I could have shut down row 15.. this was my attempt at a block while playing off more than one consonant..
>Mona: ?EEORSS O8 .OREnESS +71 355
#note Ironically, sim is telling her to play off two tiles rather than bingo...

>Jeff: FILOPTZ 14B F.Z +30 364
#note I realized after the game that I could have won... at this point it was 10 o'clock and I had a long drive ahead of me. I had tracked correctly in my first two games, and thought I had mistracked this one (I usually do). Somehow even after scanning over my sheet a few times, I missed the Y not being crossed off. If this were a tourney I probably would have gone through and tracked again to figure it out. I even saw my outplay, but went with the traditional 'play off the high point tiles first' strategy. Ah well...
