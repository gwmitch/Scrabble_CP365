>George_Latis: AGIIV 8D VIGIA +26 26
#note June 19th, round 1 of 6. George was a one time nemesis, but I started getting used to his defensive playstyle. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AGINOTX 7E TAX +40 40
#note Well, now I know two words containing two Is next to each other.
>George_Latis: ANN H6 NA.N +15 41
>Matthew_Larocque: DGIINOS 6H .ODI +9 49
#note Indeed, I suck.
>George_Latis: EM 5J EM +19 60
>Matthew_Larocque: EGHINOS 4D SHOEING +79 128
#note But kind of recover...
>George_Latis: EF 5E EF +25 85
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDLOUY 3G YOU +25 153
#note Seems best, although bayou/(em)u is cool too.
>George_Latis: GNU L3 GNU +13 98
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDILRR D8 .IBRAL +22 175
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDILRR --  -22 153
#note I am not good at playing phonies, and bridal for 28 is what I could have found.
>George_Latis: JO 3C JO +20 118
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDILRR 7K BRR +13 166
#note I am not sure why I failed to play ANYTHING at D2, but I was destined to suck balls this game.
>George_Latis: AEW 2E AWE +20 138
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEILU D8 .ALUED +20 186
#note Chalk up another miss. I didn't even decipher (r)ebuild, go me.
>George_Latis: ANT E10 ANT +14 152
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDEEIO M3 OE +12 198
#note Ok, I didn't know rebody and the rest, but reboiled I would have played without second thought. However, that requires me to smarten the hell up.
>George_Latis: AEIMPST M6 P.IMATES +80 232
#note And that's what I get for playing oe.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCDEIL N10 BID +27 225
#note What, find a bingo containing clunky letters? I have to be consistent, here.
>George_Latis: AQT O9 QAT +20 252
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CELLRZ L12 ZERo +52 277
#note Even with all the missed bingos, this was by far the worst move of the game, of the tournament, and in recent memory. George asks me why I didn't just play Ze(d) instead. I can't answer that. Or lez? LEZ? Come on I know 3 letter words holy crap.
>George_Latis: DEELPRS 15H DEPL.RES +140 392
#note George's second triple triple in tournments. Yet, he's not even happy about it - instead he shakes his head at my total lack of defense. Heh.
>Matthew_Larocque: CCELLST -CCLL +0 277
#note Ok so I need a bingo and a place for it just to prevent an embarassing blowout, but I have approximately no time left on my clock. So expect some top tier playing from here onwards.
