#note i spent a good 6-7 minutes weighing up h12 SIZE, f10 ZO(A) or my play.  i didnt see 8g (AN)ODIZE.  i went with mine - quackle likes SIZE. there's only 4 equity points covering all choices
>ross_brown: TTU 13F TUT +9 376
#note i exposed my S and I after laying down SIZE. this might have influenced Ross, but then again it might not have either.
