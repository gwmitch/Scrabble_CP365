>Jim_Burlant: AEGIOOS -IOO +0 0
#note I've often wondered how many points is low enough that it's worth exchanging.  10 points for AGIO really didn't seem enough - for 14 or 18 yeah, but 10 I have a hard time justifiying, especially with the EOS keep.  The sim says AGIO 8H wins and I'm docked 7 points.

>Jim_Burlant: AEGRSTW 7F WEAR +29 29
#note Sim prefers a fish of F7 WOG, docking me 5 points for this choice.  Given how my fishes have gone this tournament (often going 3 turns without yielding a playable bingo), I'm much more inclined just to turn tiles and try to score, hoping the bingos come up.

>Jim_Burlant: AGLSTUU D3 LUG. +10 39
#note Didn't consider burning the S with AUGUST. 
>Robin_Levin: AFMO E8 FOAM +35 89
>Jim_Burlant: AJNOSTU D9 JAUNT +39 78
#note Best, nothing else sims within 5 points.  Now that I've woken up I'm at 38%.
>Robin_Levin: AII 3C I.IA +8 97
>Jim_Burlant: AEIOSYZ 2F ZOYSIA +71 149
#note 2E AZO wins with this second, roughly 3 points down.  I saw the danger of putting the Y next to the triple, but for 71 pts I'd rather clear out everything than keep the Y.  I  didn't expect her comeback play to be so severe.
>Robin_Levin: EEEPRST L2 STEEPER +89 186
#note When we played, this was scored as 93. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?BENNOU 1H BO +35 184
#note Didn't know either of the bingos in this rack.  BUTANONE would have played at 13B for 72, and K7 BOUNDEN also scores 72.  The duplicatoin in this rack wound up really hurting me, as I had a hard time seeing through all the duplication with the blank in the rack.
>Robin_Levin: EEPV C11 VEEP +32 218
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEMNNU B13 MUN +23 207
#note NEUMoNA plys at K4 for 80.  400 past the range I've gotten to.  This is a solid non-bingo option, but I pay a much bigger price than the sim is antipicating for having missed the bingo.
>Robin_Levin: EGGNRSU J7 SNUGGER +71 289
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEHNR 12H CH.ER +26 233
#note Once again the bane of the blank racks.  I saw CHANGER, ARCHINES and a bunch of other bingos that wouldn't paly.  Only playable bingos are words I wouldn't have known: REBRANCH, ENDARCH, and bRECHAN.
>Robin_Levin: AEF H12 .AFE +27 316
>Jim_Burlant: ?AINRRT 15G R.tIRANT +58 291
#note Couldn't find 4F sTRAINER, which wins 26%.  My feeble word knowledge has played me down to 18% winning chances.  BTW, there are no bingos on row 15 that reach the triple; they're all 58-point airballs.  I might as well open up an S hook and hope I hit the blank - it's probably the only way I can win at this point.
>Robin_Levin: BDIK 5I BIK.D +24 340
>Jim_Burlant: ADEHILO A14 HO +29 320
#note 13H (A)I(R)HEAD wins the sim, with this choice second.  I'm going to have to play short and extend this game if I want to get back in it.
>Robin_Levin: DW 9I W.D +11 351
#note This play was correctly scored as 11, but for some reason she only added 1 when she announced her score and I didn't catch this.  So, at this point, I'm under the impression that I trail 320 - 345.
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIIL G13 AI. +12 332
#note 3J DETAIL scores 19; Quackle wants turnover to get at that blank.  That said, Q is still out and I don't want to increase my chances of getting it, either.
>Robin_Levin: Q C2 Q. +11 362
#note While the play was scored as 11, for some reason Robin only added 1 to her score and I didn't catch the error.  This was critical later in the game.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILLO 11J .OAL +16 348
#note Crawling back in.  The sim doesn't like this very much - 14L LOID  wins.   Makes sense - given the pool I should have looked to unload the I.
>Robin_Levin: ELNO M3 OL.EN +27 389
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIILT O10 TIDIEs +45 393
#note At the time I made this move, courtesy of the scoring errors, I thought I was trailing 348 - 382, and that this sequence of this, followed by AAL 10D, would win by 1. 
>Robin_Levin: CDIOT N2 COD +19 408
>Jim_Burlant: L 10D ..L +5 398
#note AT this point I think I've won the game 402 - 401.  Recound corrected the score, final score recorded as 407 - 402, Robin's win.
