>John_O'Laughlin: UU -UU +0 0
>Evans_Clinchy: AFILNRW 8F FLAW +20 20
#note Obviously he's close to a bingo. Not sure how that changes my options here, though. FLAW seems best to me.
>John_O'Laughlin: AEELNST J2 LATEENS +72 72
>Evans_Clinchy: EIIKMNR I3 KIN +27 47
#note Strongly considered KIF F6, which fishes with the stronger EIMNR leave, or KI I3, likewise. I figure I'm blocking lanes no matter which fish I choose, though, so taking a few extra points seems like more of a sure thing. Close call, Quackle sides against me slightly.
>John_O'Laughlin: UUU -UUU +0 72
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIIMOR 2J .IMIER +16 63
#note Missed MONIE, which looks pretty clearly best. I was trying to open things up while playing from behind, but this is just a bad play.
>John_O'Laughlin: EINORTT G4 TROT.INE +60 132
>Evans_Clinchy: ACELOOU 5E CO.O..L +36 99
#note Maybe ORACLE O1, but I stuck with the "I'm losing, I'll leave lanes open" strategy.
>John_O'Laughlin: AEHM 1L HAME +62 194
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ACENSU 12A CANgUES +81 180
#note Missed USANCES L4, which scores an extra point and certainly looks safer. Although I'm still losing, so there's something to be said for playing a little more aggressively...
>John_O'Laughlin: EENQ E11 Q.EEN +28 222
>Evans_Clinchy: ADFNSWY 6F F.Y +35 215
#note Still losing, still leaving lanes open. This play probably sucks. Sim prefers FAYED 14B, which kills triple lanes. I opted to leave them wide open instead.
>John_O'Laughlin: UX F14 XU +52 274
>Evans_Clinchy: AADINSW A12 .AWS +27 242
#note To block the one remaining triple, and for this score, gotta ditch the S.
>John_O'Laughlin: BO B12 .BO +24 298
>Evans_Clinchy: ADINORU H1 DUO +19 261
#note Gotta open a lane. This does the trick.
>John_O'Laughlin: IPUZ 10F U.ZIP +24 322
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AAHINR 1A HAIRbAN. +86 347
#note Wow, tremendously lucky draw to cash the bingo lane right away. Now I can start playing defense?
>John_O'Laughlin: OV B1 .VO +12 334
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGJOR 3A D.JO +24 371
#note Didn't want to play JOG, since a monster J play down to the triple might kill me. This seemed like the safest option.
>John_O'Laughlin: DO 4C OD +21 355
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEGIR A3 .EGRADE +33 404
#note Taing out the triple, scoring, racing to the finish line. Missing REGINAE C8, but I don't think it matters. I like this play better, it blocks the spot I need to block.
>John_O'Laughlin: V 14D V.. +13 368
>Evans_Clinchy: GIPRTTY 15E ..TTY +24 428
#note Maybe PINY C10, but I thought keeping a vowel was safer.
>John_O'Laughlin: EEILRST L5 STERILE +68 436
>Evans_Clinchy: ABGGIPR K11 PRIG +22 450
#note Best, but not quite enough.
>John_O'Laughlin: I F1 .I +4 440
#note Four points isn't much, but it's all he needs. Thus ends an awesome game.
