>Sam_Kantimathi: AIOT 8E IOTA +8 8
>Jim_Burlant: EGGLORT 9H TOGGLER +63 63
#note Quackle prefers the 7H placement by not quite 2 points.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EHM 8M HEM +31 39
>Jim_Burlant: ADILOPR 7B DIPOLAR +72 135
#note Good thing I missed the best play of K4 PRODIGAL.   Sam had a rack if INBUILT, and he was going to play it down the D column for 80+, which this blocked.
>Sam_Kantimathi: BIILNTU -  +0 39
#note Lost challenge
>Jim_Burlant: AELORUW 10F ALOW +18 153
#note Weak play, couldn't think of L8 ALLOW, which dumps the same tiles, scores 10 more, and wins the sim.
>Sam_Kantimathi: BIILNTU C7 .NBUILT +24 63
>Jim_Burlant: EEMRRSU D4 RUM. +16 169
#note No really good options in this position; this sims within 1-1/2 points of K9 GRUME, the sim winner.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?EIIKNO 4C I.ONlIKE +62 125
#note 12C LIONLIKE scores 74 and wins 17%; LIONLIKE wins 22.
>Jim_Burlant: CEENRSV 12B C.EVER +22 191
#note Only 8s are through an O with this rack.  I couldn't think of anything else but to turn the rack and dive into the bag.  1B VICE,  H1 NEVI (which I didn't look for) M7 CHEVRES (the latter of which I didn't know) are the sim winners. But this worked out well.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DERX 5A RED.X +47 172
>Jim_Burlant: ?FNSSTU 3J FUNS +19 210
#note Hmmm...interesting options.  H1 UNFIT wins by roughly 3 points over this choice.  I'd rather unload one of the S's.  Even though Sam has closed back within 19, I'm still winning 86%.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EIWY L1 WI.EY +30 202
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEHNST 1L .HEN +30 240
#note While there's a really cool bingo here in N5 aDH(ER)ENTS, it's not the best play.  3A NTH is apparently best.  I'd rather take away his easiest play.  DST? isn't the worst thing leave-wise.  Quackle doesn't like this much, but it worked out.
>Sam_Kantimathi: GUY 3A GUY +28 230
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEOST 13F TErEDOS +64 304
#note 11 I EScOTED is best, and wins 93%.  This wins 91.
>Sam_Kantimathi: IOV A1 VI.O. +30 260
>Jim_Burlant: AAINNPS K5 APIN. +26 330
#note Or 12I PINA.  Both win 95%.  And I was about to have a killer draw that sealed the game.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EJT 12K JET +33 293
>Jim_Burlant: AAINSSZ H1 NAZ.S +42 372
#note Sim says that NAZI is better; I prefer to take the bag down to 1 by playing off the S.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AAAOQRT 10B Q.A +32 325
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEFIS A8 DEAF +37 409
#note Arrrgh.  Didn't know FACIEND, so I didn't know there was an out bingo on row 1.  Oh, well.  
>Sam_Kantimathi: AABORT 14I ROB +26 351
