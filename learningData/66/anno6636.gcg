#note 14 points worse than my best bingo.

#note WEAPON is probably a good deal better, despite the all vowel leave, as it takes away the triple lane and scores 10 more points.  However this works out a lot better than it should have.

#note I liked this better than FORME or FORAM in the same spot because I really wanted to ditch the I.  However, FOMITE C2 is even better.

#note If only YEL* was good, I'd be able to bingo yet again.  I spent a long time thinking here.  If I empty the bag and can't go out in one, I probably lose.  However, fishing off one didn't seem to offer much here, because he is likely to have his own high scoring long plays on the C column.  Championship player agreed with my choice.
>Kwak: BDEGIIV K9 DIB. +31 489
#note Leaving outs of VEGIE and GIVEN, guaranteeing the win.
>Dave: ELNR K4 .NE +12 488
#note Thinking he was going out, I just took the points.  But leaving myself no outs allowed him to set himself up for even more.
