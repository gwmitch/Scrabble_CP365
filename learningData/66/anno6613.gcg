>Jim_Burlant: AACELTY J6 CLAY +25 25
#note In the absence of knowing the bingo in this rack, the best non-bingo option is apparently 9G AYE.  For the better players who know the bingo, F4 ACYLATE wins.

#note Arrrgh.  Missing RELEGATE E4.
>Nick_Meyer: AJLU 5B JU.AL +26 120
>Jim_Burlant: ABIINOT E9 BIOTA +20 140
#note Nothing stands out in this position; this is one of 8 plays that sims within 2-1/2 points of 3C ORIBI and E9 BIOTIN, the top simming plays.
>Nick_Meyer: BINR F10 BRIN +29 149
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIIMNN 7J .IMN +7 147
#note How many of you would find the 8's at B7 and 3d?  The B7 bingo scores 80...but it's very low prob.  After burning a couple of minutes and only finding REMININg* (which I knew was bogus) I felt that all I could do was open a line for my blank ' it didn't seem right to turn more than 3 tiles from this rack.  This, predictably, is weak.
>Nick_Meyer: DEFI 8A DEF. +31 180
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIINN G13 IN +7 154
#note This time, the whiffed bingo is INDaMINE.   As for non-bingo options, Nick told me after the game that he liked this play a lot.
>Nick_Meyer: ADGILRT M1 DARTLI.G +70 250
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEINPS 1F SPINDlE. +86 240
#note Despite the blundering, I'm still in with a good chance...but this is the turn that let me down.  I wasn't able to find SPlEN(D)ID, which would have scored 158 and wins 76%' this choice wins 30.
>Nick_Meyer: ADH 2F HAD +35 285
>Jim_Burlant: GINOQUW 4J QUI. +26 266
#note Not sure why on earth I didn't play QUOIT.  Apparently the sim prefers 15D OWING keeping QU, with QUOIT 4I simming as the runner up.
>Nick_Meyer: ASTV 15E VAST +24 309
>Jim_Burlant: ?GNOWWZ C2 WO +14 280
#note I thought this was a nifty little play to set up a potential Z bomb.  I had the blank, I had the Z, ther's no way he can hurt me as badly there as I can hurt him, so why not?  Nick said after the game that he liked it a lot.  
>Nick_Meyer: EER N2 REE +26 335
>Jim_Burlant: ?GNOUWZ K9 OWN +17 297
#note I wonder if, in retrospect, I should have exchanged 4, keeping UZ? to keep hope alive for a possible PUTZ or FUTZ.  I opted for this because I felt the only way to keep row 1 alive was to give him another threat to worry about.
>Nick_Meyer: AIKOP L11 OKAPI +26 361
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGORUZ A8 .UG +5 302
#note Quackle says I should cash the Z.  His play of OKAPI was critical - with the bag at 7 or more, I would have exchanged EGO and looked for the F, I, or T.   This was a wasted turn - I just felt that I should fish off some garbage and get my Z play.  Quackle says I should have played off GAUZE for 30 leaving OR?.  Makes a lot more sense than staking everything on the Z, now that I look at it.  Too bad I couldn't think about this at the time.
>Nick_Meyer: OV 2A VO. +18 379
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEEORZ 15K s.ZER +39 341
#note Disappointed that I didn't draw the I, F, or T, I just move tiles. ZOEAE is much better and would have prevented the play that follows.  Not that I can win the game at this point, but I would not have given up the huge play on the next turn.
>Nick_Meyer: AEFIMOT N10 FOMIT. +38 417
#note Not sure I have these racks written down correctly, as I'd checked out of the game after I drew into a non-existent Z bomb.  Final score 352 - 428.
