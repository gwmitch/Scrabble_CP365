>Chris: CEIOPSU 8D PICEOUS +78 78
>Joey: AEEHNNS 9G HEN +25 25
#note I saw the less common of the two 8's, but not the common one which was available.  Not a good start.
>Chris: ADEFFOS J4 DOFF. +20 98
>Joey: AENRSTY G7 Y.. +13 38
#note It was either this or YA K5.  ENRST didn't seem quite reliable enough.
>Chris: AAEIRSU K1 URAEI +17 115
#note I sure wish he had played AUREI instead.
>Joey: AEGNRST E4 RANG.EST +86 124
>Chris: ABIOSVX 2J B.AVI +32 147
>Joey: ADEGNTT M2 .ATTED +24 148
>Chris: KNORSXZ N5 OX +52 199
>Joey: ?EGGINT N1 G.G +8 156
#note I overlooked AGE L2, which is better.
>Chris: IKNNRSZ 10B ZIN. +33 232
>Joey: ?AEIMNT L6 hEMATIN +84 240
#note NIZAMATE was a bit too volatile for my taste.
>Chris: IKNORRS K11 KIRN +30 262
>Joey: EILNOSW M9 WON +28 268
#note I had SWINE 15K, but decided to leave that open with the penultimate S in hand.
>Chris: EJORRSU 15F JURORS +48 310
#note Figures.  And he blocked EVULSION too.
>Joey: EILOSUV 7C VU. +15 283
#note Playing this meant that I would probably need a bingo.  I probably should have played VIREO 13I.
>Chris: AAAEEIY N9 AYE +42 352
>Joey: DEILOST 13D STOLIDE. +62 345
>Chris: AAEILOQ 12H QI +45 397
#note Foiled again.  He only scored this as 44, perhaps thinking that I would sound less annoyed during this annotation.  Well, it's the thought that counts.
>Joey: ?CDEPTW O11 sWEPT +47 392
#note I didn't really have a choice that saved the blank, so I just had to hope for the best.
>Chris: AAEHLMO 3C HAOLE +28 425
#note A notable alternative was HAMAUL 1G, which would have made my bingo less homeless.
>Joey: ABCDILO 4B COB.A +33 425
#note The closest I can get is LIBRA, which falls 9 points short (10 points with the score corrected)
