>Carlene_Wallis: CDEOV 8D COVED +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: AEOORSU H7 U.O +4 4
#note Close call between this and exchange OOU.  More style preference than a clear case of right/wrong; sim says this is a 2- point dog to exchange OOU.
>Carlene_Wallis: JLTY E7 J.LTY +30 58
>Jim_Burlant: AEGMORS G7 M.G +23 27
#note I thought I might have missed something here...and I did.  Barely 100 past the probability range I had learned prior tot he tournament, MOORAGES would have played at G9.
>Carlene_Wallis: BDI I5 BID +16 74
>Jim_Burlant: AEEORST I9 ROSEATE +64 91
#note The only playable bingo (no 8's anywhere), winning 44%.
>Carlene_Wallis: DW 15H W.D +21 95
>Jim_Burlant: BDEMORY J8 BEY +34 125
#note Didn't know REEMBODY, didn't look for EMBODY.  Weak.
>Carlene_Wallis: AQT J4 QAT +22 117
>Jim_Burlant: ?DHIMOR K3 HID +37 162
#note Not sure why I didn't play HIM instead of HID, but this play barely gives up 7   points to HEIRDOMs 12H, which I couldn't find.  While I would have put the bingo down had I thought of it, I like this play - now if she doesn't have something ending in S, she can't burn me down the L column.  Regardless, I'm sitting at 81%.
>Carlene_Wallis: ?CEILSU 2F LEUtICS +72 189
#note How certain do I have to be about this to challenge?  I felt that, not being sure, the safest ploy would be to trade bingos, so I'd still be up 44 and now the bag would be 14 lighter.
>Jim_Burlant: ?MOPRST 13H P.STROMi +72 234
#note Major style points for this choice, but the pedestrian 1A STOMPeR is worth 20 more scoreboard points.
>Carlene_Wallis: AFILP 3C PILAF +39 228
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKOOT O12 K.TE +36 270
#note Horrible play - an auto-pilot mistake.  I wasn't paying attention to the B sitting at J8; BOOKIE would have easily been the best play out of this rack, and I saw this after I hit my clock.  But the draw did bail me out. And this is one instance where I benefitted from the wrong play - had I put down BOOKIE she would have had a Z bomb at O12 this turn.
>Carlene_Wallis: FIZ L12 F.IZ +52 280
>Jim_Burlant: AAHIOOS 1L OHIA +27 297
#note Or 14G IOTA.  This sims best, at 53%.
>Carlene_Wallis: NX D2 N.X +20 300
>Jim_Burlant: ALNOSUV E3 .UV +21 318
#note Quackle prefers C2 UPON and 15C UNAVOWED.  Eh.  And this choice does work out for me.
>Carlene_Wallis: EGINR 8J .EGRIN +33 333
#note This looked fishy...but given my rack I think you can see why I let this stick.
>Jim_Burlant: AELNNOS N3 SOLAN.NE +62 380
#note Best, and I'm now at 80%.
>Carlene_Wallis: EEIR 5B RIE.E +19 352
#note Arrrgh.  I thought this looked phony, but wasn't willing to risk the challenge.
