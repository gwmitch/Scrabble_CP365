#note RAMEN looks better to me, as it doesn't take the S hook.
>Stuuuuuuuu: ADEG 4J EGAD +23 51
>Rafi: BIPQRRS N2 QIS +31 103
#note This was a tricky play for me. Not too thrilled to have to part with my S, and not happy about setting up the triple, but there aren't too many 3 letter words that can hurt me here. Also, if he had a high point tile, he would have played it last turn so chances are unlikely that I'm getting burned with ZIN or JIN. Another good option (which I didn't see in the game) is BRRR, setting up QI.
>Stuuuuuuuu: FIR O1 RIF +34 85
>Rafi: BDKPRRS D5 K.RB +13 116
#note Maybe I should play DREK instead, but against Stu, I prefer not giving away an easy S hook opportunity, and I'm not a fan of the B-P combo. Because Stu plays so fast, I think it's good to close the board and force him into making mistakes. KB(A)R is another good option.

#note Lucky.
>Stuuuuuuuu: ?ACELOT C8 ALOETiC +72 177
#note Well, that's pretty lucky too.
>Rafi: EEIIPTX D11 XI +31 223
#note Yuck. Missed EXIT in the same spot.

#note Quackle likes PICOTED, but I think that's a bit too gutsy.
>Stuuuuuuuu: AZ 2F ZA +64 289
#note Ouch.

#note Much, much better than taking the bingoes.
>Stuuuuuuuu: EHU 2J HUE +27 341
>Rafi: ?LNNSTT E10 L.NT +7 356
#note Quackle likes ex. LNNTT??? Well, I disagree. NST? looks great to me with a bunch of E's, I's, and O's left to draw.
>Stuuuuuuuu: EGIO H11 .OGIE +24 365
>Rafi: ?DNRRST G10 R.D +7 363
#note This play sucks. I really need to play off three tiles here instead of two. D(E)N(A)R looks pretty good to me.
