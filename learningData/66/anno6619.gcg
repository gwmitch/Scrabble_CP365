>Jim_Burlant: CENRTVY 7H T.VY +12 24
#note Only knew WIVERN with an I, not a Y.  Didn't like VERY G3 due to easy front hooks as well as the vowel-less leave.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: ?CEMNOR 13F COR.sMEN +84 137
#note Before this play, I had seen the 7's and noticed the cool 8 requiring either an S or a P...what are the odds that he'd hang the P?  So far this is looking really good and the duck says I'm at 80% winning chances.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEIOOQ -AEIOOQ +0 137
#note This is the actual post-bingo rack.  How many times this tournament have I had to throw a post-bingo rack right back into the bag?  Quackle likes this exchange better than all others.  No reason to throw the E away, given how fundamental it is as a rack building block.
>John_Wiley: RTUV O11 V.RTU +24 111
>Jim_Burlant: AEHILNR L8 HIN +27 164
#note Best play, and I'm at 70%.  L1 HAILER sims within 1 point, but looks recklessly volatile.  However, had I known the course this game would take, I might have put that down.  But at this point I was still feeling confident.
>John_Wiley: COW H12 C.OW +44 155
>Jim_Burlant: AEKLMQR L2 MAKER +24 188
#note I take a mild hit here, with the sim preferring 10F MAR(C)EL; I just figured I should turn as much of this rack as I could and try to open the top of the board since my 50-point lead had been cut to 9.  But this game was about to collapse on me; drawing the Q for the second time was only the least of my problems.
>John_Wiley: AALR M2 ALAR +24 179
>Jim_Burlant: ?LNQRTZ -QZ +0 188
#note Perhaps I needed to thorw more back into the bag; at the time, with AAAAAEEEEEEIIIIIOOOO still unseen, I saw TRENAIL and ORTOLAN as poossibilties.  As such, I saw no reason to throw the L back into the bag.  Even with this exchange, which Quackle doesn't like, I'm at 61%.  A play I hadn't considered, ZiNC (burning the blank for 34, wins 65.  Quackle says the best play here is to exchange LQRT, but I'm not sure I agree - what am I going to do with the Z on this board if I don't land an I?
>John_Wiley: DEF N2 DEF +39 218
>Jim_Burlant: ?AJLNRT E5 LA +8 196
#note I felt I should try to open up the left side of the board.  Not even one of the original Quackle choices, it sims mid pack but then again, there really are no great options in this position without vowels.  This choice concedes not quite 3 points to 6D JAB, the sim winner.  Where are the vowels?
>John_Wiley: EES O1 SEE +20 238
#note Play incorrectly scored as 20.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DGJNRT -DJT +0 196
#note Given that the unseen pool is > 50% vowels, I felt a shorter exchange was in order.  Sim prefers 6D JAB which I think is stupid - what am I going to do if he puts down a defensive play like GAN D4?
>John_Wiley: DEIILNS D6 LINDIES +73 311
#note John is now at 98% - amazing how quickly this game is slipping away from me.
>Jim_Burlant: ?GHNORZ C11 HONG +23 219
#note 10C GINZO wins the sim but I think that's misleading.  John is certainly going to block row 4 ASAP, and I need to make sure there are multiple lines open.   I'm just under 4% winning chances.
>John_Wiley: AGJ 4D JAG +25 336
>Jim_Burlant: ?AADRXZ F2 ZA. +33 252
#note HEXAD 11C wins the sim, and that's an option I hadn't considered; it scores well and threatens ZA on the next turn...but kills column B.  I'd rather use the Z to set up the X and give him something else he's going to have to address so as to keep the B column open.  
>John_Wiley: ORT 14L TOR. +17 353
>Jim_Burlant: ?AADORX G2 AX +45 297
#note Sim prefers AXON 8A, but I think it's too easy for him to shut down cheap.  I'd rather follow through with my plan, trade 45 for 30, chip away, and bingo to get back into the game.  I'm back up to 7%.
>John_Wiley: EOS H1 OSE +31 384
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADORST B5 dOTARDS +69 366
#note The only other playble bingo is TOwARDS.  Quackle says the best play is 15A DOST, but that's essentially conceding the loss and just trying to minimize spread if I get hit with the Q.  How did Quackle know that I was going to draw it yet again?
>John_Wiley: EIIINPU A6 NIP +31 415
#note John's comment after I saw the Q in my rack:  "You can relax, Jim.  I'll take care of everything from here."  Smartass! :-)
>Jim_Burlant: Q -  +0 366
>John_Wiley: EIIU 9B .E. +5 420
>Jim_Burlant: Q -  +0 366
#note My annotation stops here; John milks his tiles for 15 more points before going out with YETI L12.   Final score 366 - 455.
