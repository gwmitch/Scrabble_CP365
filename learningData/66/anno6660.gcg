>Toh_Weibin: CDDEEUW 8D CUDWEED +84 84
#note Was thinking DEWED before I found this move. And er yes, I learnt this word from http://community.livejournal.com/scrabbling/95637.html. Thanks!
>Woland: BCHOT 7I BOTCH +29 29
>Toh_Weibin: ABGIOPX 6H GOB +29 113
#note E5 BAG(U)IO is an interesting choice that I might have taken.
>Woland: HIOR 8L HORI +49 78
>Toh_Weibin: AIILPSX 9K PIX +49 162
#note Phew, that makes things a lot easier.
>Woland: EFGNT L4 FET...NG +34 112
>Toh_Weibin: AAILLSV 5C SALIVAL +79 241
#note Didn't see the second best move, which is the four-timer ALL(U)VIA. Happened to chance on SALIVAL while contemplating the L-OBE hook.
>Woland: ADNV D1 VAND. +26 138
>Toh_Weibin: AEEIJRU 1A JAR.IE +48 289
>Woland: ADEERRS D7 S.AREDER +72 210
>Toh_Weibin: EIMMRTU C9 MUM +23 312
#note Blocked my own spot for IMM(A)TURE. I play this without awareness of the pool - should have played MUTER instead.
>Woland: ?EIINSY 14B YE.SINIa +74 284
>Toh_Weibin: EILRTTY 15H TRITELY +90 402
#note Woohoo!
>Woland: KLOPU N10 PLOUK. +42 326
>Toh_Weibin: ?AFINOW E11 WOF. +44 446
#note Wasn't 100% sure it was this or DOF that didn't take the S hook. A great draw, nevertheless.
>Woland: GOOO 11I GOO.O. +16 342
>Toh_Weibin: ?AEEINU 2F EUgENIA +64 510
#note Really not sure what to do with this rack. That aside, I missed EUcAINE as another bingo. One thing weird about Quackle is that it (probably) doesn't reflect win % accurately - I don't see any cases where my move loses. Even with Woland's next move...
>Woland: AAENRTZ A1 .AZERANT +125 467
#note Incredible!
>Woland:  (AEINQST) +32 499
#note So I'm left with SATINE + Q. The best way to end any game.
