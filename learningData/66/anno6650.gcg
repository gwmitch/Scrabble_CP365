>Jim_Burlant: AADGHYY 8G YAY +18 18
#note Quackle prefers 8G GAY; I'd rather unload both Y's.
>Mark_Pistolese: EGT 9F GET +13 13
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGHOO 10F OH +21 39
#note Quackle doesn't like this at all, preferring 7G AGO.   But this worked out, perhaps better than it should.
>Mark_Pistolese: ITZ 11D ZIT +28 41
>Jim_Burlant: ??ADEGO D6 AGOni.ED +86 125
#note Hmm.    I felt that E?? couldn't be worth trading 50 points, but the sim results say that 12B GOAD 37 is better, though not by a whole lot - this choice sims not even 1/2 point down.  And given my next draw, it's probably a good thing that I did put the bingo down.
>Mark_Pistolese: EIIM 13B ME.II +16 57
>Jim_Burlant: DNPRTVX -DNPV +0 125
#note Quackle prefers 8C VOX and C12 PERV.  Play only 2 tiles out of this rack for 13 points?  Or turn 3 with PERV and give back 30 or more on row 15?  Be serious.  Best exchange according to quackle is to throw everything back in except the X.
>Mark_Pistolese: ACI 8A CIA. +18 75
>Jim_Burlant: ABFNRTX 14A FAX +43 168
#note Best - too many scoreboard points despite the unbalanced leave.  So far so good - I'm at 83%.  A cool extension - D3 ANTAGONIZED sims not quite 1 point down.
>Mark_Pistolese: AELLRSW J2 WALLERS +80 155
#note Arrrgh.  I held this...and thought I had seen it somewhere before.  A huge mistake on my end that probably swung the game in his favor.
>Jim_Burlant: BENNRTU 7I B.UNT +21 189
#note Lots of comparable options in this position.  Considered NUB E4, but felt that the T was definitely worth the 7 extra scoreboard points.  I'm still winning 61%.  
>Mark_Pistolese: IOOP 4H PO.IO +20 175
>Jim_Burlant: AEENNOR 15A EN +26 215
#note Best.  To this point, with the exception of letting his phony WALLERS* stick, I've played a pretty strong game.  This is where I start to struggle - for the next several turns, none of the plays I put down feel right, but I can't find plays that seem good, and the game gets away from me.
>Mark_Pistolese: DFNOU 14F FOUND +34 209
>Jim_Burlant: ABENNOR 15H NO +14 229
#note Hmmm.   Was too fixated on keeping the rack together.  A 15H play was definitely the call but I didn't let myself see NEON for 23.  This play takes a mild hit (not quite 4 points), but it's not as severe as I thought it might have been.
>Mark_Pistolese: AEHT 8L EATH +29 238
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEINR H1 CAR. +24 253
#note You have to know the bingo to play it.  I saw BACTERIN, BRISANCE/CARBINES and VIBRANCE as possible 8's, and  none of them play.  Of course, the one I don't know, CARABINE, would have played on row 6 for 66.  As for non bingo choices this fares quite poorly.   Best non-bingo option is I2 ABO..  CARABINE wins 80%; this wins 48, and the game slips away from me at this point.
>Mark_Pistolese: AJ N8 .AJ +26 264
>Jim_Burlant: BEEEINS 10A BEE. +7 260
#note I saw 3L BEE and rejected it - for the most part, my fishes had not worked effectively this tournament (with the notable exception of landing both blanks earlier this game!) and I couldn't see playing for 14 and giving back 30+ down the O column.  I ultimately felt that the best thing I could do was fish off BEE somewhere out of the way.  As for this choice - this is the sort of mistake you'd never make in online play that can happen on a live board.  I honestly mistook the blank I for the blank N, and I thought I was putting down BEEN, not BEEI*.  Even if Mark had spotted this - he said he looked at the play and thought it was legit - he would have been wise to let it go.  The sim likes E4 BEE - I thought it would foolishly kill 8's on row 3, which was one of the more promising lines on this board.
>Mark_Pistolese: AELRSTV B3 RELAT.V.S +64 328
#note Mark has two other bingo options (both disconnected 9's).  Can you find them?    No matter, I'm in serious trouble now.  Mark wins 87% here.
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNRS E4 LID +11 271
#note No idea what to do here - was just trying to keep the rack together .  A1 LIED wins the sim, and it wins 7%.
>Mark_Pistolese: EIKR A1 KIER +32 360
>Jim_Burlant: EGNORSS C1 NOGS +21 292
#note Only saw 8's here and missed the 7.  Even if I had found the 7, it only wins 17%, and given this board/pool, that's probably a generous estimate.
