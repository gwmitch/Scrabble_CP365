>Mark_Pistolese: BEIV J4 VIBE. +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: EEFLOOR K5 FOR +28 108
#note Didn't know FOVEOLE; I felt that any of the other dumps gave up too many points.  I felt that I'd have to take the points until I couldn't turn the racks.
>Mark_Pistolese: EIP I7 P.IE +18 34
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILOX J10 XI +50 158
#note Best.  Too many points relative to the next best plays, D4 LEXICA and D8 COXAE to pass up.
>Mark_Pistolese: ADENNOT E5 NON.ATED +86 120
#note Best bingo.  Mark is back to 23%.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEILOY F4 LEY +29 187
#note Played this figuring I'd have to exchange next turn.  The draw did work out...sorta.
>Mark_Pistolese: GRTU 3C TRUG +18 138
>Jim_Burlant: AEINORT H10 RATION +31 218
#note Seriously considered fishing here...but thought he would be too likely to take whichever line I opened up.  Quackle prefers that I fish with 12D OD - I'd rather score 31, take out H15, and take six stabs at the bag.  Surely if I turn tiles I'll land one of the blanks, right?
>Mark_Pistolese: ACEGLNT 14H .CTANGLE +76 214
#note The only bingo - Mark is now up to 37%.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIRW D1 WA.E +22 240
#note Not sure why I played here - AWEE O12 takes out the most dangerous line and leaves the same combo.
>Mark_Pistolese: Q 13G Q. +21 235
>Jim_Burlant: AADEEIR 1C A.ARDEE +33 273
#note WEARIED wins by 2 points.
>Mark_Pistolese: ?BGIILN M7 oBLIGIN. +74 309
#note L6 Bingos - sIBLING, BILkING, eetc. win the sim.
>Jim_Burlant: IKNOOUZ L12 KI.O +32 305
#note Not paying attention to the board, and I missed ZOOID at 12A, don't ask me how.  But it wouldn't have mattered.
