#note Round 6 of 6 of the june 19th tournament. Looking for a big win after a really depressing game. I like this start.

#note Well then
>Moses_Bodah: MU -  +0 34
#note Sorry Moses, this is not going to be a good game for you now...
>Matthew_Larocque: HILORST O4 SLOTH +46 264
#note Trochils ok
>Moses_Bodah: MU N6 MU +22 56

>Moses_Bodah: ERW D1 WE.R +22 78
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADOTTU J10 OUT +10 295
#note Uh, yeah, outdate is fine. I somehow thought it required a D on the end.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGITTY F7 .ITY +17 351
#note Quackle likes git/gite/gey/get at M7. Or tye/yet hooking wear. (C)ity just jumped out and looked good enough for balance.

>Matthew_Larocque: ABEFFOT C11 OFF +40 491
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEFFOT --  -40 451
#note I figured this wasn't a word, and Moses can't win anyways, so guess this was pretty pointless.
>Moses_Bodah: BIP C13 BIP +34 225
>Moses_Bodah: BIP --  -34 191
#note Well now, that was unexpected.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEFFOT C11 FOB +36 487
#note offbeat.. that's pretty much how I play scrabble
>Moses_Bodah: EPS L8 PES +23 214
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNOOT 3M OF +21 508
#note Simulation suggests f(r)oe at D12 is the best, but out of the choices I'd go with fon for 28. A counter play would still open up the TWS in that corner.
>Moses_Bodah: DEW B10 WED +23 237
#note Scored as 25, it appears. I don't think Moses would have been thrilled to do a recount on this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAENNOT A12 AEON +20 528
#note And scored as 21 for me. Neonatal was the bingo that could have launched me to 600. Or outdate... what a fail.
>Moses_Bodah: IL E10 LI +10 247
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGNTUY B14 YA +22 550
#note At this point I'm not sure about this rack. I swear I did not have an E. Because I have "gnt" written as my leftover letters. But then things get screwed up, as Moses played out with a 13 point play s hooking "wear". Regardless, una(waked) is the the best scoring. Did not know yuga. Blind to wear(y).

#note Scored 13
>Moses_Bodah:  (EGT) +8 272
#note - 10 on time, so 552 - 273. Made up enough spread to get 4th place and a TWL as a prize.
