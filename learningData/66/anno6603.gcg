>Jim_Burlant: AAENNOU -ANOU +0 0
#note Best exchange, only exchange AANOU sims within 2 points.
>Dominick_Mancine: GUY 8G GUY +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: AEENNOP 9G OPEN +22 22
#note Sim prefers 9F NOPE by roughly 1 point, and 9F PONE sims interchangeably to this play.  So far I'm playing well; now I start playing like an idiot.
>Dominick_Mancine: ABOT 10G BOTA +29 43
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIMNS 11H NIMS +30 52
#note This is one of those racks where I always see the 8's and miss the common word 7.  Cinemas, of course, is the only playable bingo but all I saw was AMNESIAC and CARMINES.  As non-bingo options go I debated the value of the S and felt 7 points was worth the sacrifice.  The sim disagrees, saying that NIM for 23 is much stronger.  The draw bails me out (an S was the first tile out of the bag) but I squander the advantage.
>Dominick_Mancine: CEEFJNT -CEEFJNT +0 43
>Jim_Burlant: ACENSUV -UV +0 52
#note Sim prefers K5 UVEAS by not quite 2 points. I felt that, because he had just drawn 7 and I was drawing 2 to ACENS, I'd be much better off just exchanging, rather than burning the S for 23.
>Dominick_Mancine: AIKL 12K ILKA +18 61
>Jim_Burlant: ACEENOS O7 OCEANS +37 89
>Jim_Burlant: ACEENOS --  -37 52
#note ILKA is one of those words I know, but almost never see played.  I couldn't remember if it took S, and I spent a couple of minutes dickering over this, trying to decide if he was setting up his own S or not.  I felt it was worth the risk of throwing one outside the strike zone.   Best play here, according to the sim,m is 13M AE, but I think that's silly; I'd gladly trade the 4 points for a leave of CANES.
>Dominick_Mancine: AOY M10 OA.Y +22 83
>Jim_Burlant: ACEENOS -OE +0 52
#note Quackle says I should fish off the A and E for 10 points; I'd rather keep the A.
>Dominick_Mancine: IQ N9 QI +17 100
>Jim_Burlant: ACEMNNS 13I MAN +11 63
#note Sim prefers 13I CAN.  Eh - while it prevents any sort of big X comeback, what good does it do me to shut down one of the two best lines on this board this cheap?  I didn't like this play a whoile lot but I didn't see much else.  And yes, I was sure crossing my fingers he didn't have the X.
>Dominick_Mancine: IP O8 PI +23 123
>Jim_Burlant: ACELNRS 14E LANCERS +75 138
#note Sim prefers K3 placement by not quite one point - for me, the deciding factor was that the 14J hotspot had to go so he couldn't burn me with the X.  I'm back at 48%.
>Dominick_Mancine: AEFZ 13B FAZE +34 157
>Jim_Burlant: AEHHLRW 14A HAW +33 171
#note Couldn't think of WHEAL, which left me with way around anything but a 14A play.  I didn't like this play at all when I made it, and with good reason.
>Dominick_Mancine: DO 15A OD +31 188
>Jim_Burlant: AEHILOR D11 LE. +24 195
#note Best - wins 37%.  Any of the other choices give up way too many points. And, this at least gives some glimmer of hope for an open board.  But not for long.
>Dominick_Mancine: GV 12C V.G +20 208
>Jim_Burlant: AEHIORS 15F HO +12 207
#note The NIMS play was me missing a bingo, and we all miss bingos on occasion.  OCEANS/ILKAS* you could make a weak case for.  This is definitely the biggest strategic blunder I make for the remainder of the game. AEIRS is definitely a dynamite combination...but on this board I need to evaluate the position and forgo building a rack; my first priorities should be to score and do so in a way that opens the board up.  Even though the score is close, my winning chances are under 50% because of how dead this board is.  While I was puzzling over my rack on my next turn, I realized that I should have played AERO(GEL) keeping HIS.  Decent score, but most importantly, it opens the western half of the board and he won't be so easily able to control the board.  HO is a good play on a more open board.  But not here.
>Dominick_Mancine: D 13B ....D +25 233
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRSW K5 WAIRS +23 230
#note At this point I felt that I had to turn the rack and put points on the board just to stay in the game.  Quackle disagrees, saying that I should have exchanged 3.  Given my next draw I'm not sure it would have helped.
>Dominick_Mancine: JR 6J J.R +26 259
>Jim_Burlant: CEEIINO L2 NICE. +19 249
#note Now I'm rattled.  L1 COINE(R) is much better and doesn't leave me vowel overloaded.
>Dominick_Mancine: INX K1 NIX +21 280
>Jim_Burlant: EFILOOT 2J F..ITE +34 283
#note 2J FINITO wins; too bad I couldn't think of it.  Still, with EEEEEE unseen, is this that bad?  Regardless, it wouldn't have stopped his next play, and I still would have been screwed given what came out.
>Dominick_Mancine: ET 3J E..T +31 311
>Jim_Burlant: ELOOORU 4G ROUE +11 294
#note Quackle says an exchange is called for...but it wouldn't have helped.
>Dominick_Mancine: ??ADIRU 5B UnAIReD +66 377
>Jim_Burlant: ELOOTTV O1 V.TO +24 318
>Dominick_Mancine: BDERSTU D1 BURS.TED +82 459
#note And now I've completely disengaged from the game.  I thought this was good.  Lesson that I thought I had learned back when I rated in the 1000's:  challenge practically anything on the out play.  A well deserved shellacking.
