>Sam: AAEHLMN --  -67 100
#note Really stupid. Eric seems to know his words. I should have known this wasn't good, just HEMAL and HEMATAL. Also, wouldn't I have studied HEMINAL? Stupid.
>Eric_Goldstein: ACGINRU 4C CINGU.AR +72 192
>Sam: AAEHLMN N9 ..HALE +32 132
#note I rushed this play. Missing 11K NAH is a 5-point error.
>Eric_Goldstein: DNRU 15L DURN +38 230
#note I held it, but wasn't confident enough to challenge. Study could really help here.
>Sam: AEMNNOU 14F NOUMENA +66 198
#note Didn't know NOUMENAL 13G. Again, study. 7-point mistake.

#note Laid down SCRAPIE? 1H, then picked it up...and told me after the game he was going to make the blank an R! That would have been a huge break.
>Sam: FMRTVVY 12L FR.Y +28 311
#note Right or wrong, here is my thinking: "If I exchange (I would have kept MRT probably, though Q wants me to keep MR), I will be behind 69 with Eric to play. Even in the best-case scenario, a huge 90-point bingo to O1 or something, it will be a tie game with me behind a tempo. By playing FRAY, I cut the lead to about 40. If I can keep pace at down-40 until building a bingo, I can actually win this game. The board is plenty open right now." FRAY is the besst equity play, but Exch. FTVVY is .4% better in win%. So, tell me: is my thinking right or wrong? Would you exchange or play through this?

>Sam: AEMOQTT 6G Q. +11 342
#note Frank was sitting next to me during this game, and asked me after why I didn't just play QAT C8. My answer was that I was fishing for the 4/18 possibility of OSTOMATE 1G. QAT mostly closed off the possibilities of CDE column bingos, and Eric would probably then block rows 1 and 2. I had to hope Eric would block the CIN in CINGULAR instead.
>Eric_Goldstein: ADOP 1H .PADO +9 398
>Sam: AEMOOTT -  +0 342
#note Got my fish, but it was blocked. I've never seen the word SPADO in any context before, Scrabble or not. Frank pointed out TOMATO 2J, but that puts me down 15, empties the bag, and leaves me behind a tempo. Lesson: learn some fives!
>Eric_Goldstein: AAIOUWY 2J YO +29 427
>Sam: AEMOOTT 11N .O +10 352
#note I was fishing for STOMATE M1...but little did I know that SPADO pluralized to SPADONES, so SPADOS*. It seemed very likely that Eric had the S, but I had to hope otherwise.
>Eric_Goldstein: DOS 5D DOS +29 456
>Sam: AEMOTTW 11D MAW +33 385
#note Even this is a mistake. It's 8 points worse than TAME 11D, which doesn't allow for juicy overlaps. 
>Eric_Goldstein: AAINRUW 10E WAUR +25 481
#note AWA 10D is slightly better.
>Sam: EOTT 3K TOTE +12 397
#note Turns out we misadded the score after DURN...the final score should have been 481-403, but was 471-403.
