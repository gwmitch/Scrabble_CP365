#note i missed many better bingoes.  I did consider DANDLED and DANDLER, but went for an eight, for no good reason.  I should've counted up plays better.

>k8: EHNOORU L3 REHOO. +42 154
#note I saw HONOURE(R) but couldn't convince myself it was good (I am notoriously bad at discerning what -ER words are good, and most of them in my history haven't been), so instead I played a suboptimal phony.  Oops.

>k8: ACIINTU 6G CAUTI.. +11 165
#note spent a long time looking for bingoes, and saw INCAUTIO(N), but again, never studied it, didn't trust it, chose not to play it.

#note QUBIT!  That would've been much better.  With the threatening A hook, I chose to make the board even more volatile.
>cg: ARY H12 .RAY +21 292
#note At this point, I thought he might not see the A(DRIFT) possibility.
>k8: BEEMNTX 14D BEME.NT +25 341
#note were it a word, it would be the best play.
>cg: AGS H1 GAS +27 319
>k8: AEIIMSX A8 IXIA +43 384
#note too many choices!  Q prefers AMIES A11.  It scores less and uses the S. I thought the S was more useful to keep than the X, but I wasn't keen on opening another bingo lane with the unseen blank.  this gives me an 85% win prob.
>cg: ?IJNOSU 1A JOUStIN. +98 417
#note Q says hold off on bingoing - JUCO is an 86%, JOUStING is 73%.
>k8: AAEEMSU 3G E...... +17 401
#note i'm sure i could've played this out for more spread, but i'm too paranoid that i'm missing something or will accidentally open something for my opponent to do that.
