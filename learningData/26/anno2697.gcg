>Jason: BIISSTW 8G WIT +12 12
#note Just didn't feel like WITS or WIST. (-2.3)
>Joel_Horn: ?DEHIOU F2 HIDEOUt +76 76
>Jason: ABIQSST J6 QIS +39 51
#note Having the duplicate S looks good in hindsight. :)
>Joel_Horn: ACN 5C CAN. +12 88
>Jason: ABDOOST 4D BO. +22 73
>Joel_Horn: ?ACGLOR 3C LOC. +22 110
#note Missing CAROL(I)nG, which I saw in the post-mortem, and OL(I)GARCh.
>Jason: ADOSTTU 6J .UOD +14 87
#note QUOTA's slightly better. (-0.9)
>Joel_Horn: ?AEGIRY G8 .EARYInG +66 176
#note Missing REA(D)YInG for 16 more.

>Jason: AEFILPT F10 FEAT +37 235
#note Ooh, FA(KIRS) is very cute. Playing three games in the car on the way up with Fiszbein, in one game there were double-doubles through AT and AL. Because of that, I kept an eye on the double-double potential through ER here.
>Joel_Horn: DEN L12 DEN. +17 234
>Jason: IJLPSST N2 JILTS +45 280
#note Joel was not happy with this play.
>Joel_Horn: AH N9 AH +28 262
>Jason: FINOPSV O1 FON +29 309
#note Passed on V(ER)SION (correctly), but missed OV(ER)SPIN. (-17.3)
>Joel_Horn: AETX 4K EXA.T +34 296
>Jason: DGIOPSV 11E P..IODS +40 349
#note Missed the better double-double S(ER)PIGO. (-3.1)
>Joel_Horn: ANW M9 WAN +26 322
>Jason: AGLMPUV 3L AM.. +29 378
#note Q likes G(A)U(D) a little better. Either way, gotta block the big Z play. (-1.9)
>Joel_Horn: ELZ 2J LEZ +33 355
#note "Outdrawn again," Joel muttered. (And here I thought I was outplaying him ... maybe his tone changed when I quickly saw his misses in the post-mortem)
>Jason: BEGLPUV 1H PLEB +30 408
#note The only play. But if you'll look at the draw it wasn't quite what I'd hoped for and for a few panicked moments I thought I'd lost.
>Joel_Horn: EIMNNRR 10I MI +15 370
#note Joel had me for VIGVUG, not VOGVUG, and blocked the only V play he saw, VI(S). Q likes I(D), given my shortage of G plays. Q says he can't win given optimal play, but this let me breathe.
>Jason: GGOUVV I10 ..G +6 414
#note (C)OG is five better; sets up VU(G)G, forcing him to score little and block.
>Joel_Horn: ENNRR H1 .EN +5 375
>Jason: GOUVV C1 GU. +4 418
#note Didn't see (MA)U(D). Joel thinks I had IVV and am setting up VI(G). (-12.0)
>Joel_Horn: NRR H7 R.N +5 380
#note Surprised he didn't go out in three.
>Jason: OVV 2F .O. +6 424
>Joel_Horn: R 13K R. +5 385
#note He saw CANER and had a free play, but still didn't play it. He also went over on time.
