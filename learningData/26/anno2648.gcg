#note I saw AERoNAUT, but didn't make the connection that it was definitely better to give my opponent a U to work with instead of an A.

#note Dave told Samantha "I really like that word."
>Noah: AADNOTU L2 D.TA +19 125
#note I knew this was a sucky play-it's awful, pretty much anything is better. I was focussing on scoring, but this isn't even that great at that. I don't know what I was thinking, but I remember I was way to focussed on finding an L column play. Just ignore this play. :-)

#note I thought about RICH and INCH, but I kind of wanted to get ENTOZOA, which seems like a good spot here. I guess it wasn't really a great strategy. However, I hate Quackle's idea of INCH instead of RICH. RICH makes bingoing on A column much more possible, and that is why. For some reason, though, INCH has a percent win of over 1% more. Weird.

#note I saw MENINX first, but didn't think there was any place to put the C. Only until after the game did I see ABACI. We thought that there was only a four point difference in score, but it turns out MENINX is 19 points better!
>Dave: EEFIKRS C5 KEF +33 385
#note As it turns out, this is four points behind, with RE(C)K leading.
