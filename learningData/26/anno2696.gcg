>Jeff_Clark: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
>Jason: AAEELLT 8H ALATE +12 12
#note Another tricky opening rack. Q likes playing short with ALE. (-2.2)
>Jeff_Clark: AADEEOR I4 AREO.AED +61 61
>Jeff_Clark: AADEEOR --  -61 0
>Jason: DEGGILL L4 LEGG.D +18 30
#note I don't know if it's because of Jeff's rack or what, but GILD at 9J is the surprising clear-cut favorite. (-13.6)
>Jeff_Clark: AADEEOR K8 .OEA +11 11
>Jason: AEIILNR 7C AIRLINE +65 95
#note "You can almost hear Alex (Fiszbein) say 'nice find'," Jeff said. Missed it at M9. (-6.6)
>Jeff_Clark: ADEIOPR M9 DOPIER +29 40
#note Thank heavens I ducked PRE(R)ADIO here.
>Jason: EGMNSST 8A GEMS +31 126
#note Missed SEGM(E)NTS. (-31.2)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AIITZ M3 ZIT +28 68
>Jason: AABFNST J10 FAB +31 157
#note Huh ... I just realized I played FOB at J10 vs. Milton keeping ANST. The N2 placement is marginally better. (-0.4)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AHIW B7 H.W +20 88
#note Counted as 22.
>Jason: ANOSTTW N10 WAT +33 190
#note Missed (NA)NOWATTS. (-37.0)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AHILRT O5 LATHIeR +87 175
>Jason: IJMNOST 6J JO. +27 217
#note Should've played the S, too. Or Q's pick of M(IS)JOIN. (-3.5)
>Jeff_Clark: EEOPSUU N6 PEE +28 203
>Jason: IIMNOST 10B NIM +19 236
#note IN, same spot, is slightly better. (-3.2)
>Jeff_Clark: ?NOSUUU F6 U.U +5 208
>Jason: AIOSTUY 14J YOU.S +32 268
#note A good mistake. Played YOU at 11D (Q's pick), picked it up to do this; 13 more points with two S's still out, I felt it was clear-cut. Turns out I blocked Jeff's ABOUNdS. (-3.5)
>Jeff_Clark: ?ABNOSU 11C NUB +16 224
#note Didn't know ABOUNdS has an anagram: BAUSONd, which plays at 5C.
>Jason: ADIINST 12D DIN +24 292
#note I really have no idea why I chickened out on DISTAIN here. I saw it ... I don't know. (-55.7)
>Jeff_Clark: ?AENORS 15F REAsONS +81 305
>Jason: ACDISTV N2 CAD +27 319
#note My only decent play of the game, setting up an unblockable S- hook.
>Jeff_Clark: EFKOQRT 9G KEF +32 337
>Jason: EEIISTV 1L VISE +40 359
#note Surprisingly to me, Q likes VI(E) at G13, 93.80% to 84.70%. (-8.1)
>Jeff_Clark: Q D6 Q.. +12 349
#note "If I don't play it now, you probably won't let me," Jeff said. Indeed.
>Jason: CEINRTX 10F XI +31 390
#note Q says the counterintuitive T(ET) at 5K is three better.
>Jeff_Clark: OOORTVY 13E TORO +12 361
>Jason: CENRT H13 .C. +5 395
#note This is -14.0 to (WAT)T(S)? How? I debated between this and letting Jeff play the V but blocking the big Y play at 5K.
>Jeff_Clark: OVY 5K Y.. +22 383
>Jason: ENRT 13L N.T +14 409
#note (-7.0)
