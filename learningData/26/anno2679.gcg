>Jason: AEIIILN 8H INIA +8 8
#note Why not ILIA? Good question. I'll get back to you when I have an answer beyond "I'm an idiot." Q likes passing II. (-6.9)
>Daniel_Milton: EEW K8 .WEE +14 14
#note Playing next to us, Joel Horn drew 14 E's in his win over Carol Rav.
>Jason: BDEILRT 7D DRIBLET +71 79
>Daniel_Milton: ADEINRS 9C RANDIES +68 82
#note Daniel made like four or five math errors this game; this one I didn't catch. Scored as 67. SERRANID as a double-double is 86.
>Jason: ABFNOST J10 FOB +31 110
>Daniel_Milton: AJY I11 JAY +31 113
>Jason: ?AANNST 14C ANNATeS +72 182
#note Wow. ANNATeS is the only seven. Hated allowing the juicy T- hook but saw nothing else. The only other bingo, STANNAr(Y), is superior. (-0.7)
>Daniel_Milton: DHO 15F HOD +34 147
>Jason: ?AAIOPS 13B APO +20 202
#note OMG, do I have to count SPO(R)A(N)gIA on the missed bingos tally? Can I petition to include a "no human being would ever find this bingo in a million years" clause into future missed bingo bets? (-34.5)
>Daniel_Milton: EEGN 15A GENE +27 174
>Jason: ?AILPRS 6F PA +24 226
#note I only got 23. At least now we're back to the correct differential. Close call here; RASP and SPAIL along row 12 have higher valuations; this a better win percentage. (-1.2)
>Daniel_Milton: ITTW 12D TWIT +22 196
#note Clueing me in to the fact that he doesn't see the ANNATES hook.
>Jason: ?EILNRS 5G LImNERS +67 293
#note Take your pick; it's basically a toss-up among all 10 playable ones. (-0.5)
>Daniel_Milton: CEOO D3 COOE. +16 212
>Jason: DFHORTU L2 FOU.TH +24 317
#note Q likes HOUR at 4K; scores and leaves a guaranteed 28 next turn with H(A)T(E). But why give up the juicy -I and -S hook at this stage? (-5.2)
>Daniel_Milton: IQ 11F QI +24 236
>Jason: DILRSTU B10 DIL.T. +36 353
#note "Never would've thought of that," Dan said. And I never thought of DILUT(O)RS at 3G. grrr... (-34.6)
>Daniel_Milton: GIOY A7 YOGI +27 263
>Jason: EMRSUUZ 3I ZER.S +48 401
>Daniel_Milton: CEEUV B4 CUVEE +25 288
>Jason: AMMRUUX M7 MUM +23 424
#note Q likes MAX, same spot, a little better. I guess I can see why. (-7.9)
>Daniel_Milton: AEGKORV M1 VA. +11 299
>Jason: ALRUX 3D .URL +7 431
#note (FA)UX is better. This was the only guaranteed out-in-two I saw. (-4.0)
>Daniel_Milton: EGKOR N9 OKE +21 320
#note Best.
>Jason: AX J1 AX. +26 457
#note Knappster later told me I was in first after round 1. :)
>Jason:  (GR) +6 463
