>Gary: DEJ H7 J.ED +12 12
>Cesar: ?EGGLNT 10E GLE. +8 36
#note GELD is apparently better because it doesn't give back an O hook (-1) exch ggn is also almost as good.
>Gary: UU F9 U.U +3 15
>Cesar: ?EGINST J8 SIGNETs +76 112
#note how silly.. sIGNETS scores one more. i can't count. but STEwING is the best here in terms of defense/etc. (-2.5)
>Gary: BIY 11I I.BY +18 33
>Cesar: EENNOOT L9 TO.ON +16 128
#note EON M11 is nice, i didn't think of inbye this turn. (-7)
>Gary: ?ADEEIT 14D rEADIE.T +59 92
>Cesar: EELNRSV H12 VE.L +33 161
>Gary: BDEI 15A BIDE +26 118
>Cesar: ADEMNRS 15K AMEND +35 196
#note i saw M10 REMAND and was deciding between that and my dumb move. i know REMAND is better, but the only way i can explain this here was i wanted to play aggressive. (and i'm sure you could make the case for REMAND being more aggressive than AMEND). (-4)
>Gary: AX 14A AX +40 158
>Cesar: GPRRSST E12 TR.S +12 208
#note A12 GRAB is better or BIDERS. i struggled for about 5 minutes wih this move. i laid down BIDERS and picked it up. (-2.5)
>Gary: EFFLNNU 13C FE. +14 172
>Cesar: GNPRSVY -GNPVY +0 208
#note keeping NPS is better than keeping RS here (i really need to look at the pool more often!) (-4.3)
>Gary: KOW M12 WOK. +31 203
>Cesar: AEIRRRS N11 RERA. +31 239
>Gary: HO I6 HO. +19 222
>Cesar: HILRSUV 5E VIRUS +25 264
#note the case E is suddenly pretty important here. i don't wanna be in this position.
>Gary: OOW M7 WOO +14 236
>Cesar: AHILNPU F2 UNH.P +18 282
#note bad move warning!. i did see L4 HULA, and really didn't want to play it because of the Q spot and because it created a less restrictive bingo lane. H1 PILAU is the sim winner. i should have seen it. i really didn't want to play UNHIP because i started suspecting i'd need a high point tile for scoring if it got any closer. (-5)
>Gary: AIT 3E A.TI +5 241
>Cesar: AAEFIIL 12B LIF. +31 313
>Gary: IQ 2H QI +22 263
>Cesar: AAACEIL 1I LAIC +11 324
#note last move LIFT simmed very close to FILE/LIFE  (O8), which i would have definitely played had i thought of CLIFT!! ILEAC there is 43 but 1I AECIAL is wining the sim. it does the best job of killing bingo lanes. at this point i just wanted to secure it and got lazy. my move is about 4 equity and win% pt down (-4). AECIAL is >99%.
>Gary: ACMNORY 8M .Y +5 268
>Cesar: AAEGMNO L3 MANGO +21 345
#note TAR G3 is simming higher. (-17). amusingly if i played it i would have drawn MANGONEL.
