>Sam: CEILRRS F8 .LIR +9 9
#note Quackle shows that the star play here is REC H7, which I agree with. It's a 4-point error. I could have given myself two S-hooks, and almost guaranteed an early bingo. Instead, I didn't bingo until Turn 12.
>David_Stone: BHO E10 HOB +25 45
>Sam: ACELRSX D11 CALX +39 48
#note Did not even look for a better play once I saw that he gave me a high-scoring spot for CALX. CAREX D11 scores 16 more points. A 7-point error.

>Sam: AEEMORS G8 .AME +24 104
#note I'm not sure if I'd be ballsy enough to play Quackle's choice, OE N14. However, I'm down by a lot already, and David might not know LEGATEE (he challenged it as an out play). Of course, he also might not have an S. 1.5-point error according to Quackle.
>David_Stone: ACEPS A8 SPACE. +42 201
>Sam: BEHIORS 7G BRO +29 133
#note Superleaves: EHIS=10.85, EHIRS=21.44. I played for points, and got bitten by a bad draw. 7-point error, as BO 7G is better despite being worth 8 fewer points.
>David_Stone: ISV M12 VIS. +14 215
>Sam: EHIIORS 12K HI.E +20 153
#note This was the game-ending mistake. With two disjoint S-hooks, OI 13I is the right play despite scoring only 8. I'm not down by *that* much. 8-point error.

>David_Stone: IQ O1 QI +35 336
>Sam: AAIIPRZ 11J ZAP +42 249
#note ZAP has higher equity, but PARIAN 3I is slightly better in win%. Didn't know it.

#note Doesn't show up in Champ Player's choices, but I was distracting him while fishing for the 2/9 chance of DINITRO J1.

#note Thought it was only DAVEN, and saw he didn't have an outplay. Ugh.
