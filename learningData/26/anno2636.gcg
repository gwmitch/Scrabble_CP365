#note This was an interesting decision. I thought of just trying BURR, but missed the better setup of BRR 7L.

#note I had high hopes of getting the bing down with this rack, but sadly it was not to be.

#note Close choice whether to fish with YAR/YARN/YARD 13K, or take the points and break up the rack.

#note Missed EGGhEADED A7! This one really bugs me, because I saw it right away after the game, as soon as I looked at the spot. Just played too quickly.
