#note Saw J8 OAFS 46, which Q likes best, but decided to keep the S...
>marcus: OOW 4C WOO +18 230
#note Blocks E1 DIABETES. Sigh.
>trashman: ABDEIST A12 .IDE +24 235
#note Doesn't even make Q's top 15. 3B BAD scores 2 more and has a much better leave.
>marcus: AIV 6B VIA +17 247
>trashman: ABNRSST 3B BAT +24 259
#note Also doesn't make the top plays. J8 BATS 30 best. Board is getting too clogged...

#note Q likes 14F RINSE 36, but I prefer creating a bingo lane...

#note Time to shed an S and fork the board. Scores best.
>marcus: EY 1N YE +26 318
#note Blocks ROSARIUM. Heavy sigh. 
>trashman: AIMORSU 14E AMI +22 321
#note Holding the case S, set up another juicy lane... 14C DUOMI does the same thing but scores 3 more and has a better leave. Missed it completely...

#note Foiled again...
>trashman: AGOORSU B12 .RA +19 340
#note Lost the game on this turn. Missed lots of better options hooking the G in row 1. RUGOSA scores 32 and takes control of the game. 
>marcus: JKN 8G J.NK +14 347
#note Fortunately, he can't score well, so the game's still afoot...
>trashman: AGLOOSU 1H GOO +14 354
#note Again make a suboptimal play. Q likes leaving one in the bag and playing JO, or 1A LOGO. Slip sliding away...
>marcus: AAGR 1A RAGA +26 373
#note Hmm... At first I thought I had mistracked, as I showed no R's were remaining. Apparently, this bag had 7 R's. I should have counted them, but I mistrack often, and didn't consider the possibility of a defective bag. Not sure what the ruling would be on this one, but this seals the deal...

>marcus: EHI 7D HIE +14 387
#note Apparently, there were only 3 U's in the bag, as I ended with ULL on my rack. Final is 390-372. Not sure whose bag this was, but I don't recall ever playing with an incorrect bag before...
