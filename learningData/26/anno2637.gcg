#note Superleaves: JN=-3.93, MNNU=-9.96. This 6-point leave difference would suggest a dead heat upon simulation. However, UNMEWS E6 sims almost 2 points better. At first, the 'Details' don't offer an explanation: We score about 6.3 more on our next turn after UNMEWS, but the opponent scores one more after UNMEWS. This puts JEWS up .7 or so on UNMEWS in a two-ply sim, given it is worth 6 more points. But the "rack leftover value," which is the leave after our next play, I believe, favors UNMEWS by about 2.6 points. I'm guessing that this means UNMEWS leads to better racks down the road. After dumping off the J, I have a good chance at a bingo-friendly rack after UNMEWS. However, I could often be hamstrung by consonant-heavy racks after JEWS. Of course, this is mostly just my postulation. Any thoughts?

#note I "know" ABODING, but I just didn't trust myself on it. That's why I forwent ABODED A10 here. Increased study is the only thing that can help with plays like these. 15-point error.

#note Simulation clearly prefers IF N9, which seemed excessively risky to me. Anyone like it? I guess I should be playing more aggressively...also, most plays here open up a TWS somewhat. 9-point mistake.

#note REDIP L11, which I didn't know, is best. Surely could have found RAPID L11 though. 3-point mistake.

#note This is Champ. Player's choice. Anyone like IF or OF N9, though?

#note Jeremy told me his rack after this play, and I thought it was very interesting. He liked VOICE, and I liked GECKO 2A. Champ Player's favorite is KORE F7, which supposedly wins 75% of games. I think that's because it uses my most fruitful spot. As it turns out, KORE would have won our specific endgame for Jeremy.

#note OKE 10M would have been 10 better, blocking my highest-scoring out.
