>Cesar: HIINOTX D11 .IXT +28 43
#note i actually didn't think of FIXIT, i think i would have played that instead of FIXT, but FIX keeping the T hook sims best. (-2)
>Rachel: AEMORRW H1 MARROWE. +95 149
>Cesar: AEHINOU C13 EAU +26 69
#note next time i gotta write down the scores when trying to consider plays... HOE keeping AINU is fine, i have consonants to play thru next turn. (-2) also EAU is kind of dangerous.

>Cesar: DEHINOS 1A HEDONIS. +95 164
#note the anagram is a little better (-0.5)

#note this is really an exchange rack, and i would have exchanged anytime, but down by so much i thought it was time to start hoping for miracles, maybe i could draw a U and play QUEAN or something next turn. i really should have exchanged though (-2) it likes keeping MNO.

#note lol
>Cesar: GHINQTV 12A Q. +21 208
#note exchange or 4C QINTAR, which i should see. i think i stopped caring after uPRISEN (and that killed the tournament too, because i still had a decent chance at second) it's all too close by win %
