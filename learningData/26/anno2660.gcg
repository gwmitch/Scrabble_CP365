>Pete: DEGILOX 8G GOX +22 22
#note Best.
>Stephen_Knapp: EFTW 7H WEFT +26 26
>Pete: BDEILOS L1 BOLIDES +87 109
#note only bingo, clearly the best play.
>Stephen_Knapp: AAOPSTW -  +0 26
#note did not anticipate a challenge, but I'll take it.
>Pete: ADEFHTV M2 FATED +35 144
#note Lacking anything resembling board vision at 9:10 in the morning, I missed the cool parallel plays at K4.  FATED is next after these.
>Stephen_Knapp: AABR 5H ABRA.. +18 44
>Pete: HLPTVWZ -LPTVW +0 144
#note Had I seen it, WALTZ K4 would have been some serious style points, but I exchanged.  Duck likes keeping HZ and I did too
>Stephen_Knapp: ?ADEORS 4B DROSErA +69 113
>Pete: ?AAGHNZ N6 HAG +30 174
#note HAZAN seemed a bit too suicidal.  HAG leaves well, scores well, and gives me options. HAND may have been better strategically, but I liked HAG.
>Stephen_Knapp: EIOO C2 OO.IE +10 123
#note Clearly dodged a hit here with Knapp being vowel heavy.
>Pete: ?AELNUZ 2B Z.NULA +34 208
#note ZEE in two places for 32 and my play of ZONULA for 34 are fundamentally equal in pure equity.  I liked turnover here, and keeping the E could let me score thirty something on a fish.  Now, I think I'd blay ZEE B6.
>Stephen_Knapp: ELOPS O6 SLOPE +40 163
>Pete: ?ACERUU G8 .URU +6 214
#note I hate UU.  EAU up top is probably best, but I got UU obsessed.  STupid me.
>Stephen_Knapp: HIN N10 HIN +27 190
>Pete: ?ACDEEW H1 WE +31 245
#note Best.
>Stephen_Knapp: CEINOSV 13H NOVICES +83 273
>Pete: ?AACDET 10A CADAsT.E +64 309
#note Wow, I suck.  Missed all the CAUDATE double doubles.  Even miss CAUDATE.  Find CADASTRE, which scores less, leaves opportunities for playback, and generally sucks in every way.
>Stephen_Knapp: JKO A8 JO.K +51 324
>Pete: EGMTTVY B6 MY +23 332
#note My punishment is this rack.  I wanted to kill the b6 hotspot, but ENVY was still clearly best.  good 4 % behing in win pct.
>Stephen_Knapp: INP E4 .NIP +12 336
>Pete: EGLTTVY 8C TYE +17 349
#note and it gets even worse.  I miss ENVY again, and I play the wholy awful TYE.  Huge error.  Just brainlock, really.
>Stephen_Knapp: IMRU L9 MURI. +18 354
#note And I lack the gut to challenge this off.
>Pete: GLNQTTV 12K Q. +22 371
#note LOFT wins sim, which makes sense.  Blocking the Q spot is too dangerous and doesn't score.  I alway blow endgame sequences.
>Stephen_Knapp: EIINRR B9 R.INIER +22 376
>Pete: GILNTTV 13A L.VING +20 391
>Stephen_Knapp: AE M8 AE +12 388
>Stephen_Knapp:  (TT) +4 392
#note We misscored and mis-recounted the game, and we submitted as a tie.  A lucky break I didn't deserve, seeing that I played poorly.
