#note DODOISm might be a little better, it's too close to tell at 1000 iterations
>Lawren: AEEGHLO -  +0 44
#note lost challenge
>Cesar: AABEEGG 11H BAGG.E +20 154
#note GAB is a little higher by valuation but lower by win percentage.
>Lawren: HU L3 HU. +25 69
>Cesar: AEEHIRR 12D HIREE +23 177
#note brier again is higher by valuation and lower by win percentage

#note should have seen F9 TYER or 8K TODAY (-3)

>Lawren: EFNRRSY -EFNRRS +0 134
>Cesar: LNORTWY N10 TROY +32 253
#note need to be able to see stuff like 10F WROTE. (-3) WRY or WYN also sim slightly higher by valuation and lower by win %
>Lawren: F G12 .F +9 143
>Cesar: JLLNNNW -JLLNNW +0 253
#note this is very bizarre. i would never think to keep the J on this trade, but it's simming highest by win %. i think it makes sense. at this point it's a scoring tile that i can keep widening the gap with. it's very close ahead of exch 7. keeping the N is wrong, there are three more unseen. (-0.7)
>Lawren: EIORSTU F2 STOURIE +65 208
>Cesar: ?BCNNPV -BCNPV +0 253
#note keeping the N is wrong again. BUNN is worth thinking over. keeping C? is best. (-5)
>Lawren: ADU 3C DAU. +10 218
>Cesar: ?AALNNV O7 LAVA +23 276
#note nothng wrong with D2 NAVAL... now i'm starting to play like crap. (-9). VAN 2B or D2 is fine too.. i really don't understand why i played LAVA. i think i was done trying to keep good leaves and now it's just time to score, the bag is not super promising?
>Lawren: ELZ D1 ZE.L +46 264
>Cesar: ?ELNNOT E5 NOT +14 290
#note (-5) NONE or LONE.. am i just blind to that spot? 2B TEENS is reasonable because it kills the Z. i honestly wanted to play LuTZ here but quackle hates it. (-4.5)
>Lawren: APS 1A SPA. +45 309
>Cesar: ?BCELNO 2J COB +22 312
#note G5 BENT is nice. COB seems so obvious, i wonder why BENT is better. 
>Lawren: CEEINOV 14H CO. +13 322
>Cesar: ?EELNRS F10 SE.ER +23 335
#note a horrible move. look at how good something like SCOWL is. ALE K13 sims best because of the nice leave.  with my move i knew the bag didn't look that great but i didn't think i'd draw no vowels. (-23%)  interestingly SERER is the static player's first choice, it seems as if i completely ignored the bag for the move, but i honestly tried not to. the better explanation is that i was at less than 2 mins at this point and realizing that i wasn't gonna have enough time to figure out a complicated endgame, so it was basically a crapshoot "i hope this works out" type of play. if i'd have more time, i'd like to think i'd have thought of SCOWL.
