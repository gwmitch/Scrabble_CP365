#note Club game, Madison, WI, nov. 26.
>Charles_Reinke: AEFGMOO I7 MOFO +25 25
#note Luckily this is good in SOWPODS, so Mark wasn't able to determine with enough certainty that this is phony.
>Mark_Kenas: DEMR J10 DERM +18 46
>Charles_Reinke: AEEGLNS 12F GENE.ALS +70 95
#note GASOLENE 5E is obviously superior.  I saw FENAGLES 4H But didn't want to open up the board that much.
>Mark_Kenas: IRT H1 TRI..... +39 85

>Mark_Kenas: J 7G J.. +20 105
>Charles_Reinke: AEPTTWZ M10 ZE.T +26 168
#note I have no idea how I missed so many better plays, like ZETA K9 or ZAP 11E. 
>Mark_Kenas: AD N10 AD +21 126
>Charles_Reinke: ALOPTUW O8 WOP +38 206
>Mark_Kenas: ACEERST 14G CREATES +85 211
#note Nice fit.
>Charles_Reinke: AHILOTU H12 .O.I +12 218
#note I would have played HAUT K11 had I seen it.

>Charles_Reinke: ?AEEHRT 1H .HREATEd +83 346
#note I didn't see REHEATeR 2H, but if I had I wouldn't have considered it.  My play is tied at the top with THREATEn, although this one is more likely to draw a challenge and is therefore slightly preferable (however, against a player like Mark, this doesn't make a difference).
>Mark_Kenas: EINV 13A VINE +29 284
>Charles_Reinke: ADNRSUY A13 .AN +18 364
#note I don't care what Quackle thinks, I'm going to block the triple-triple lane.  QINDARS 3G is an interesting option though, and it leads the way in terms of win%.
>Mark_Kenas: ?EOPSTW M1 .WOSTEPs +85 369
#note Not good, but really awesome nonetheless.  I didn't even hold.
>Charles_Reinke: ADRSUXY B12 S.X +41 405
#note Although SAX 15J scores more, I didn't want to risk DERMAS being phony.

#note Time is becoming an issue here...
>Mark_Kenas: AGN 4D GAN.. +18 415
#note Another phony by Mark.  This one has too many variant spellings.
>Charles_Reinke: ILOR 5D OR +11 465
>Mark_Kenas: BINV E3 V.. +6 421
>Charles_Reinke: IL 11J .L +8 473
#note Way down on time now, I miss LI 15J (making DERMAL, which I saw earlier) and the obvious TIL 13M.
