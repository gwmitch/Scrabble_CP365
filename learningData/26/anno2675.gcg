>Carol: IIII -IIII +0 0
#note Carol exchanges four tiles.
>Steve_: EIINWXZ 8D WINZE +42 42
#note Maybe I should have set up the X here with WIZEN, altho C player also goes with WINZE by a couple of points.
>Carol: EINRSTU I5 NUTSIER +77 77
>Steve_: IIIRTVX F8 .IX +26 68
#note G6 VIZIR
>Carol: ACMNNO H1 CONMAN +43 120
#note Guess I was conned on this phoney! A player the next board over even commented "nice play," but I can't say it had an effect on me letting it go.
>Steve_: EHIIRTV 11A THRIVE +35 103
#note Better to play HIVE and hold on to the nice TR combo; add in not opening the triple line and it's an open and shut case.
>Carol: BCERU B10 C.ERUB +38 158
>Steve_: DEEGGIP 13A P.IGGED +28 131
#note How do I miss PEGGED H10 for 45? I suck.
>Carol: AFMO 14F FOAM +33 191
>Steve_: EELORRT 15H LORE +22 153
#note I sacrifice ten points that TREE would have added for leave. Get it? Debatable. Q says its close between the two, and actually puts TORE on top by a few tenths in winning percentage.
>Carol: AEOV 15A A.OVE +42 233
#note Carol isn't letting up her rabid scoring pace.
>Steve_: EILOORT 12A O. +9 162
#note Q plays OOT G3
>Carol: ADW 11H D.AW +16 249
#note Carol was averaging 46 points for the last five turns after her opening exchange. Of course, I could have altered that had I challenged CONMAN*.
>Steve_: EIILORT 12K OI +9 171
#note Missed bingo number five for the tournament.
>Carol: DK J10 D.K +26 275

>Steve_: DEILRTY 2C ELYTR.ID +68 267
>Carol: ART 1A TAR +11 361
>Steve_: ABEELNU L3 NEBULAE +75 342
#note Had my bango ready to go, and didn't notice she set me up for a better one.
>Carol: ?AELOTU 1J AmULET +21 382
#note Carol misses a bingo in the A column that would have buried me with the J and the Q.
>Steve_: IJNQSST N6 JINS +33 375
#note QIS 3A comes out better since it doesn't let her score off the J.
