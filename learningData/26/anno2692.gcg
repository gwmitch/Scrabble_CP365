#note Static equity likes EPO(C)H by 5.6, but 3-ply sim x1500 iter's yields better win% for my play.  I didn't particularly want to open up the board anymore at this point.

#note greatest static-equity loss of game, -16.6.  Rationalization: I wanted to take out the most likely bingo lane on the board while denying my opp. thw middle TWS.  I ended up giving her the corner anywho*, so I should have chosen ABET 2F.  At least I knew it wasn't the best play when I made it!  I missed the E11 plays because I wasn't looking down there.  Three different ones were better, even in the sims.  Win% at this point is 99.84

#note I wasn't entirely surprised- I don't see SIMA too often and the main reason why I remember it is a reggae/dancehall song that goes "Sim-Seema!  Who got de keys to ma Beemah?" which I use to remember SIMA/BIMA.

#note best- worth emptying the bag.  I've clearly won the game at this point, though if I had wanted to maximize my spread, like in tourney, I may have anticipated her next rack...
