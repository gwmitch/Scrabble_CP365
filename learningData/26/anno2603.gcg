#note i didn't write the whole rack on this one - the R is a guess.  With the number of Es in the bag, I decided it was worth hoarding the one i had.

#note phew - I chose correctly.  this blocks the triple lane (mostly) and leaves me with a not-awful rack.  I considered trading UUV, but decided that this was better given the score and strong possibility that he could have an A.

#note i would imagine vaunt was a better play here regardless of leave, but i don't know what he had.

#note i agonized over FAWN 2A vs FUN, emptying tha bag vs not. i thought the timing was better for me if i didn't, but i'm bad at figuring this part out.  they sim fairly evenly (~63% win percent).
