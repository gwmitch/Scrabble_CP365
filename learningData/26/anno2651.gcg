#note Quackle gives IF a little bit more potency here.
>Mike_Baker: ?CEOORS H8 .CROSOmE +80 96
#note Best are COOtERS and COOlERS 9E, plus the sick CR(E)OSOtE.

#note Didn't know PEEPULS.
>Mike_Baker: AORV K10 ARVO +20 243
>Noah: AEGLUYY 13B .EYLY +28 259
#note I played this right away. I should have thought about it. Many plays are better. G11 are mostly best.

>Mike_Baker: BM 12D B.M +35 278
>Noah: GILLMRU 13J M.GUL +16 301
#note GLUM at B2 obviously, as well as GLIM N1 and B3 are best.
>Mike_Baker: ASX O13 SAX +39 317
>Noah: BEEILRT N10 BRI.L +30 331
#note BELLE N11 is best.
>Mike_Baker: AIIN O7 INIA +16 333
>Noah: EENQTTT -EQTT +0 331
#note TENET B2 and other plays like it are better. I guess since there are three As and 1 I left and there is an open U, this isn't so bad.
>Mike_Baker: AET L9 ATE +12 345
>Noah: ADENOOT 14H .OO +10 341
#note I didn't like ADENOT that much, I much prefered ADENT for some weird reason. I should have looked at what bingos it forms, and how it is VERY good wikth this pool. I prefered this to ON for some reason, wasn't really big on ADEOT. Also missed the BRILLO hook, O(X) is best.
>Mike_Baker: NRU B4 URN +10 355
>Noah: ADENQTT N2 QAT +34 375
#note I reasoned that this is better than QAT C2, which it is, but did not notice the superb TED N2 would make the endgame much happier for me.
>Mike_Baker: ACEILNO O1 NICE +47 402
#note LINAC is best.
>Noah: DEENTTT 3B TENTED +22 397
>Mike_Baker: ALO G5 ALO. +8 410
#note LOX 15M is best.
