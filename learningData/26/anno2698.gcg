>Pete_Zeigler: DEIIORT H4 DIORITE +70 70
>Jason: ELNORST 5E RET.NOLS +82 82
>Pete_Zeigler: AGHILTY K5 .IGHTLY +28 98
#note Pete: Wow, that's a bad miss.  YAH kicks butt.  I was caught up on racing for tiles, I must have decided I didn't need those 11 points.  Even GHASTLY is better. 
#note Jason: Blame the turnover mistake on me. After our start, I said something like "Let's try to break the shortest game record. 14 total turns!"
>Jason: FIIINPU G10 PFUI +14 96
#note Shoot. I thought FINI(S) was bad. At least this is second. (-7.7)
>Pete_Zeigler: AAAEHKN J5 .KA +36 134
#note I figured I couldn't turn down the points, and duck says I was right.  Perhaps because the multi-A bingoes are the first I study in each new set, multiple As don't scare me as much as they should.  AAHED 4D is an attractive alternative.
>Jason: AEEGIIN 8K .INGE +30 126
#note Close between this and AI(D)E, but with a C/V ratio of 38/27, I'll be able to get at least one consonant and solder on, right?
>Pete_Zeigler: AACEHIN N2 CHAINA.E +82 216
#note Jason: "Oh, that Pete," I thought. "Fishing for the challenge by not playing (R)EACHING." It was only after I started tracking when I realized he played it through the G, not the A. By then it was too late to hold. I'd like to think this is a mistake I wouldn't have made in the first game of the day. *sigh* Must. Pay. Attention. 
#note Pete:  I saw my rack, immediately saw the potential of HACIENDA and ACHENIAL.  I did not know ICEKHANA... when Jason's play went down, and the D or L were not forthcoming, I was unsure what to do.  I saw CHAINAGE, didn't like it, but figured it was just barely out of my probability range, so figured I'd give it a try and hope he lets it go or doesn't see the playable eights and gives me the D or L next turn.
>Jason: AEEEIIO -AEEIIO +0 126
#note Jason: Old McDonald had a farm ... I asked Pete if he needed vowels and showed the rack. After I passed, Pete jokingly asked what I kept. "The O, of course," I said. 
#note Pete:  There are 5 Collins bingoes with that rack, most likely.
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AFOPQS 3K QOP. +36 252
#note Best here.  A brainless 36 point play keeping ?S always makes me happy.
>Jason: AEOOOTT F9 TOO +17 143
#note TA(T)TOO at G3 requires board vision I don't possess. This is second. (-3.4)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AAFNSX O5 FAX.S +33 285
#note Wow am I stupid.  FAX is only 25 points of equity better. I find the cool play that costs me.  I wanted to tie the board up, because I like to force my opponent to be opening when I have the blank, but this play, while second, is a pathetic second.
>Jason: ADEOORT 6A ORATED +22 165
#note Oops. Missed TOREADO(R). (-37.4)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ANNRVW A6 .WN +18 303
#note Saw VROWS L1, wanted to play it, but couldn't leave the triple line open.  I missed the pretty NONWAR, but this play accomplished the goal.
>Jason: DEEMOSU L11 ODEUM +27 192
#note "I'm going to draw a blank this afternoon if it's the last thing I do!" I proclaimed. (Wrong again, Einstein. But let the record show it wasn't for lack of turnover.)
>Pete_Zeigler: ?AANRVZ D6 .ZAReVNA +90 393
#note Pete: The scary thing is, it didn't even take me more than a few seconds to see it.  The AAZV set off alarms, and it was quickly spotted.  I love the occasional cool bingo. 
#note Jason: I didn't know how to feel after this. Can you feel awed/impressed (at Pete) and p*ssed off (at my tiles) at the same time?
>Jason: EEEIMOS C12 EME +20 212
#note Should've just cut my losses by playing MIME/MEMO/MOME/MEME, but I liked setting up an -S hook and keeping trip-trip hopes alive for one turn. (-7.9)
>Pete_Zeigler: IILNRUW 15H ILIU. +21 414
#note Jason: "How can you have vowels?!" I thundered. "I think I see what you mean," Pete said after drawing. 
#note Pete: The IIU dump seems wise until you draw four consonants that match the three you kept.  still best.
>Jason: AEGIOSY B12 GAY +33 245
#note OK, the C/V ratio is 13/5. What're the odds I'll pull two more vowels here? (In this game, about 50/50.)
>Pete_Zeigler: BJLNRTW L1 BL.W. +26 440
#note best.  I'd been waiting a while to use that spot, and now, it was almost the only real option.
>Jason: EEEIORS 14A E..S +27 272
#note Ha! GAY followed by BLOWS. Alas, too late to have a Viebranz/McKenzie-esque game. And how the heck is EERIE at 4A 21.4 points better?
>Pete_Zeigler: BEJNRTV 4D JET +27 467
#note VERB was an option, but JET dumps the J, scores, and blocks the potential ATED bingoes on row 4 with the blank unseen.  I did not see BREVET, which appears to win sim.
>Jason: EEIORSU 1H OURE.I +24 296
#note When I saw this, I let out an "ooh!" and said: "If you're going to lose, play cool words and know your antelopes!" (For whatever reason, I see BEIORSU and always go for BOUSIER*.) And after all that turnover on literally almost every play, Pete JUST gets the blank. *sigh* Just as well; WTF would I do with it?
>Pete_Zeigler: ?ABDNRV 13G .NVAD.R +30 497
#note Oh, there's the blank.  And here's another stupid play.  I couldn't burn the blank for zero more points, which I should have.  VIBRATED 13F would have been real sweet.  Oh well, it was a bagging, and I didn't need to know what I was doing.
>Jason: CES N13 SEC +22 318
#note Thoroughly outplayed and outdrawn. Hats off to Pete. I think, after seeing (T)ZAReVNA, my tournament's low-prob bingo prize will be eligible for blank plays.
>Jason:  (?B) +6 324
