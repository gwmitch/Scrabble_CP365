>Ryan_Fischer: AEHLMOS 8D MOHEL +26 26
#note 8H MHO wins the sim, with its anagram following in different places.  ALMEH is 5th, mine is 6th.  I'd play ALMEH if I remembered it (ALMEH/HEMAL).  Drawing to SALE is okay, IMO, but only if you know all the words like the Quackster.
>Dave_Leifer: BGO 7E GOB +24 24
>Ryan_Fischer: AAADSTX 9G TAXA +28 54
#note Best, though lacking defense.
>Dave_Leifer: NORW 10J WORN +28 52
>Ryan_Fischer: AACDIIS L8 CA.DIA +24 78
#note It's one thing to study ASCIDIA.  It's another completely to realize that you have it, or ASCIDIA(N) in that mess of tiles!  Oops.

>Ryan_Fischer: IIOOSSY 8L .OYS +27 105
#note Hehe.  Bobbin' and weavin'.

>Ryan_Fischer: ??EIIRS O1 mISERIe. +80 224
#note And it pays off.  This is the second time I've drawn both blanks (at once!) versus Dave, and I'll do it one more time before tourney's end.  Crazy.
>Dave_Leifer: EMN 6D MEN +19 144
>Ryan_Fischer: KNOQTUV 2N Q. +22 246
#note I first flashed QUOT(E), forgetting to try TOQU(E), which woulda been best.
>Dave_Leifer: ARS 5C RAS +20 164
#note He took a LONG time, was clearly frustrated, and hated this play when he made it.  Wonder what his rack was.
>Ryan_Fischer: KNOTUUV 4A KNOT +38 284
#note Gave me a decent out for sure.
>Dave_Leifer: ERT A1 TRE. +24 188
>Ryan_Fischer: GITUUVZ 2A .ITZ +26 310
#note I always miss stuff like VIZ(OR).  Not a fan of that particular word, apparently.  VZ stuff tends to elude me.
>Dave_Leifer: DGI 12H GID +17 205
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGNUUV 4K VAGU. +18 328
#note Helps.
>Dave_Leifer: H N6 H.. +30 235
>Ryan_Fischer: DEENUUU L2 UN.U +4 332
#note Quackle suggests trading, keeping DEN.  I'm like, well, why don't I try to just get this game over?
>Dave_Leifer: ABR H12 .RAB +21 256
>Ryan_Fischer: DDEEEFU 13C FEEDE. +22 354

#note Fishing is stupid, just lock it down.
>Dave_Leifer: EEIORSY O13 SOY +28 322
