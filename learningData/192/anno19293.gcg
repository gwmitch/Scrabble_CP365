>Evans_Clinchy: AABEGPX 8G PAX +24 24
#note Thought about APEX for the 2 extra points, but stronger leave and defense prevailed here.
>Adam_Logan: NOO 7G ONO +22 22
>Evans_Clinchy: AABEGMN 6G BAG +27 51
#note Not sure if Quackle evaluates this position right - it's really hard to predict how any human, let alone Adam, will react to such a board-closing play. My gut told me BAG was best by far, though I suppose you could make a case for a longer play in this spot like MABE, BANG, AMBAGE or BAGMEN.
>Adam_Logan: III -III +0 22
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEEMNR -  +0 51
#note Yes, I passed. This was hilarious. So... obviously I can bingo here with RENAMES or MEANERS, but it's a weak bingo for 66 and it might give him a bigger one back - possibly even a triple-triple. He did just exchange 3, after all. If I pass, maybe he bingos first, and maybe I get the triple-triple instead! Without any inferences, the sim says passing is within 2-3 points of bingoing, and depending on what range of leaves Adam would x3 with, you could make an argument that the pass is better. But here's where it gets funny - I missed a better bingo! I have GAR(BAG)EMEN for 68, which doesn't expose any triples. Clearly the best play. If only I'd seen it.
>Adam_Logan: FHORT J2 FROTH +45 67
#note Basically the worst-case scenario - I pass, he scores a ton and he doesn't expose a 3x3. Was not expecting that.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEEMNR 2H EN.RAMEs +74 125
#note Sim prefers a less reckless bingo in line 4, scoring 70 instead of 74, like ENAMORED or ARGEMONE#. That's reasonable, but I don't mind a bit of volatility against Adam.

>Evans_Clinchy: DDIMPUV -DDIMPUV +0 162
#note This is where things start to get real weird. At this point the board is extremely closed, and I've made up my mind that the only tiles worth keeping are blanks and esses. Ergo, trade 7.
>Adam_Logan: IIIII -IIIII +0 149
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEIJN 5J .E +8 170
#note Shrug. Might as well take the 8 points before he does.
>Adam_Logan: IIIII -IIIII +0 149
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEIJNT -J +0 170
#note At this point I'm bracing myself for Adam's bingo. He must have an S or blank, right? Why else is he trading 5 instead of 7? If he's gonna bingo soon, I should keep the best possible leave to bingo back.
>Adam_Logan: IIIII -IIIII +0 149
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEINTT -T +0 170
#note This is the fourth zero, so Adam is forced to play something or he loses...
>Adam_Logan: N H6 ...N +4 153
#note ...so play something, he does. For 4 whole points.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEINT -E +0 170
#note Still trying to bingo? I guess?
>Adam_Logan: AEUV 10E UVEA +20 173
>Evans_Clinchy: AADEINT E9 A.A +6 176
#note Was really happy with this play - forking open bingo lines with a strong leave. Hoping to hit something big next turn.
>Adam_Logan: DOYZ D11 DOZY +37 210
#note Ouch. He scores big and I've still drawn nothing.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEINOTT 13C D.O +26 202
#note Sims best - keeping the board tight and my leave strong. Still hoping to hit a bingo in line D.
>Adam_Logan: CGILNY D5 LINGY +16 226
#note A cool play by Adam. He held CLINGY here and could have played it, but he deduced that I didn't have a hook for LINGY - the B's are gone, and I don't have a C because I would have played COZ last turn instead of DZO#. So he sets up the hook for big points next turn.
>Evans_Clinchy: EINSTTT E4 TIT +12 214
#note A convenient block for me, since I need to get rid of these extra T's anyway.
>Adam_Logan: CLMU 4A MULC. +48 274
#note Oops. Didn't block well enough.
>Evans_Clinchy: EINOSST A4 .ESTINOS +80 294
#note I missed (ES)SONITES in the top right corner! At least this takes out the triple.
