>Kevin_Bowerman: BEEGIRY 8H BEERY +28 28
#note Co-annotated by Amal and Kevin. KB: BEIGY or BIGEYE, I knew this was a bad play.
>Amalan_Iyengar: AADIMOV 9E AVOID +21 21
#note AI: Looking for a 2x2 but missed DIO(R)AMA
>Kevin_Bowerman: EGIIJNT E8 G.IJIN +28 56
#note KB: (R)EJIG probably, was mainly considering JITNE(Y) and this.
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAAMQSW D12 MAW +26 47
#note AI: Debating this and QI, but AAAMSW isn't that appealing
>Kevin_Bowerman: DEEESTU 15D SUEDE +31 87
>Amalan_Iyengar: AALNOQS 8A ALON. +21 68
#note Nowhere to play the Q but 10D
>Kevin_Bowerman: AELNOTX 9A LOX +39 126
>Amalan_Iyengar: ABEQSUZ K6 BU.QAS +34 102
#note AI: Interesting turn. Main choices are ZA, BU(R)QAS, and QUEAZ(Y). ZA holds well, but BURQAS sets up the Z. KB: I like QUEAZ(Y) and then ZA probably.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEFINRT 14H FAINTER +79 205
>Amalan_Iyengar: EEHNOTZ J10 ZEE +65 167
#note I hit the Z this time, but I wonder how often I will.
>Kevin_Bowerman: CHOOSTU O10 COHOST +56 261
#note Held and released
>Amalan_Iyengar: AGHNOTT 10B GO +25 192
#note HOT or TAG
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEORRTU 13K OUR +14 275
#note KB: I don't know what to do here; I hated this but didn't see anything better
>Amalan_Iyengar: AHNSTTU 12L HAT. +35 227
>Kevin_Bowerman: AEEPRTY L2 PEERY +27 302
#note KB: PEAT(Y) scores and one less and does not open. I saw it, but did not play it because I am bad.
>Amalan_Iyengar: DIMNSTU 3F MISTUN.D +76 303
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?AILNTW C12 AW +27 329
>Amalan_Iyengar: CEFILNT 14B FE. +24 327
>Kevin_Bowerman: ?EEILNT 4A ThEELIN +70 399
#note KB: vEINLET (which I missed) or LENITEs (which I did see) up top is probably better, with all the E's gone for (EM)E. 
>Amalan_Iyengar: CDIILNT 5L .ID +4 331
#note AI: I know I have to fork the bord hoping for AMI or another spot. I can't open the board and play off three or four tiles, so I went with RID, hoping for the blank or an A bingo

KB: I have no clue what I'd do here. I(MI)D is interesting.
>Kevin_Bowerman: AGIKOPR 7G KOP +31 430
#note KB: I was trying to outrun here, but of course this doesn't always win.

AI: Kevin breathed a sigh of relief when he drew the blank
>Amalan_Iyengar: ACILNRT 2B TINCAL +30 361
