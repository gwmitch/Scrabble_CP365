>Aldo_Cardia: AHOX 8G HOAX +28 28
>Chris_Tallman: EEHIMTV 7H THEM +33 33
#note HIVE I9 is standard, but I wanted to set up my V at J6. Its risky because it'll often be taken, and this also sets up the THEME hook, but meh.
>Aldo_Cardia: EMW 9G MEW +41 69
#note Big points, but my spot is left unmolested, so I'll take it.
>Chris_Tallman: AEEGIIV 6J VAGI +41 74
#note VEGIE sets up a big S hook, but it keeps a much better leave and scores 3 more. The sim likes it better by a bit and I thibk I agree - EIE goes nowhere on this board.
>Aldo_Cardia: EINORT L6 .ENITOR +28 97
#note Overscored by 1. 
>Chris_Tallman: EEFIINR M9 FINER +39 113
#note This is much better than the fishing plays - too many points.
>Aldo_Cardia: DGU M4 GU.D +22 119
>Chris_Tallman: EEGILSY 4K LE.GY +28 141
#note Thought about GLEYS 14J, which I probably should have taken, since it obstructs the scoring spot at K11, closes the board, and takes a 30 point lead that I can turn into something maybe. If I'm going to go for a more open board, then EGGY > LEGGY since ILES >> IES.
>Aldo_Cardia: KZ 11K Z..K +34 153
>Chris_Tallman: DINORSV O7 VINOS +42 183
#note Liked keeping DR but I should probably just take the 3 extra points. I was pretty relieved to have kept the S once he played ZONK.
>Aldo_Cardia: ACLSY 14J CLAYS +44 197
#note GLEYS would have stopped this, but then the ZONK hook..
>Chris_Tallman: ?DPQRTU O1 DUT. +24 207
#note Interesting draw and position here. DUTY is simming very close to QUaY/QUeY for 45, burning the blank and leaving DPRT. Interestingly, when I laid DUTY down but had not hit the clock yet, he started manaically shuffling his tiles - it almost made me take it back but...
>Aldo_Cardia: ?ADERRT 1H ReTARDE. +80 277
#note I guess I was do retarded to do so :) He had other bingoes playable, so whatever.
>Chris_Tallman: ?EEIPQR 2B PERIQuE +126 333
#note PRQ? to 126 points baby :P
>Aldo_Cardia: BEJU 1A JUBE +53 330
#note That sucked. He's right back in the game and I have to keep alert instead of cruising to a win :(
>Chris_Tallman: AAIINSU 3F INIA +22 355
#note Considered QUAI too to keep the bingo-prone ANIS, but I felt that playing that would lead to scenarios where I might need to bingo to win if he hits the E5 or C3 spots hard. INIA scores the most and sets up my S for a play making QIS with an eye towards outrunning him. 
>Aldo_Cardia: ER 3C ER +17 347
#note Taking out both scoring spots, kind of.
>Chris_Tallman: AAIOSTU 12K A..A +21 376
#note I draw poorly and can't hit the D4 spot very hard at all. This is simming 10% above the next stuff, AI J2 and exchanges. Points are at a premium, so I like taking 21 here. OUTS A4 leaving AAI is an option too, but then it gives up the A line.
>Aldo_Cardia: EFL 4A ELF +16 363
>Chris_Tallman: EINOSTU 5C SNOUT +20 396
#note I was committed to outscoring, but this is a pretty huge mistake according to Q - 18% down from (R)OU(E) L1 keeping EINST! I guess SMEW is open as well as the E and L of ELF, plus it gives flexibility, but jeez...
>Aldo_Cardia: ABCNO A3 B.ACON +30 393
#note I guess this is why the outscoring route isn't so great - he gets first crack at this spot.
>Chris_Tallman: EIIOOST L14 .I +3 399
#note Something weird is going on with Quackle's endgame analysis here... anyway, I was low on time here, and saw OTIOSE B8, but saw that it lost if played immediately. I also thought that it would be hard to block, so I played off my I and hoped for the best. He can block by playing NODAL like he did, or just simply WAP B7 though.  However, it seems like (O)TIOSE A7 does win! This therefore marks the first time (that I know of) that I threw away a sure win this tourney. It was a fun game nonetheless though!
>Aldo_Cardia: ADLOPW 8A .ODAL +7 400
>Chris_Tallman: EIOOST 9A SI +15 414
#note Low on time. Can't block both PAW and POW anyway. 
>Aldo_Cardia: PW D7 P.W +8 408
>Aldo_Cardia:  (EOOT) +8 416
#note I lost 10 on time,  so somehow the score was 402-417. We would've recounted it if that had not happened, but it looks like I would've still lost.. phew lol.
