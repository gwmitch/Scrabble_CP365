#note not the easiest move to find but bails me out nicely, can maybe score with the K at A13 next turn
>cesar: ?BELSTU 13H STUBbLE +81 213
#note FAIL. MASSIVE FAIL. even more than some other recent fails. (-9)
>jd: AHIKMQR A6 HAKIM +46 254
#note quackle quite likes HIKER at N10 as an alternative to HAKIM. I think the idea is to save the AM for H1, and also prevent him from killing me with STUBBLED (all four Ds unseen)
>cesar: CDILORU N7 CLOUDI.R +76 289
#note thats kind of lucky, i guess
>jd: EEINOQR 10K ROQ.E +14 268
#note difficult play, I can just play QI at B6 but I thought I would need the lane, and I also liked keeping IN for row 3 (although there are 4 Is remaining). will have to get very lucky to bingo, but I didn't see another great way of getting back into the game. additional bonus of ROQUE is that it gives me more chance of drawing tiles that actually do something useful. the Z could be nice.

#note i spent SO LONG TALKING MYSELF OUT OF PLAYING USUAL THAT I WAS POSITIVE IT DIDN'T TAKE A FLUCKING S!!!!!
>cesar: BGINTTT -  +0 338
#note after belting i still have like a 43% win chance!!! instead, why don't we challenge??
>jd: CDDFIOR 8L FO.D +36 386
#note dunno if I've ever played a bingo and its anagram as naturals before like that...pretty sick
>cesar: BGINTTT 4H B..TING +32 370
#note my win chances are considerably poorer now. double challenge sucks.
>jd: CDIORRY 4B .OIC +30 416
#note seemed best to block ZA plays, although if I play PARRY I do save C(ZA)R as a reply next turn if he plays on column C. still, seems worth it just to score
>cesar: ADENTTV O13 DEV +33 403
#note almost made him challenge it.
>jd: DEOPRRY 14J PYE +32 448
#note I was tired and didn't totally figure out what I was supposed to do if he blocked ARDOR. seemed like it would be good enough anyway. the best play is actually pretty sick - PAYOR and then REWED at 12F as snapback if he goes ahead and plays AHA or HA at 14J. this is 1 worse
>cesar: AAHNTT A3 HA +28 431
#note i honestly stopped caring. i saw his out too.
