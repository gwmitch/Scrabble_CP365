#note I considered this and V(O)GUE. This takes SN, which is problematic, but Michael isn't going to hit it too often. In short I whored equity.

#note I couldn't see a bingo here. BERNICl(E) is new to me. This looks better than the other options, especially since he might challenge. But maybe (V)IBRaNCE is worth it since the S is already really powerful, so better to make two good spots rather than one. Yeah, I'm liking VIBRANCE. Too bad I missed it.

#note I liked how this reduced his options and kept a good leave, compared to other plays that scored but kept problematic leaves. I stand by this.

#note I should just drop the S here too. I'm not really bingoing on this board, no point in trying, unless I play F(ORE)LEG I6, which I missed. 
>Michael_Fagen: AEMORST F2 .M +4 302
>Joshua_Sokol: CFGILRS 11G FRIGS +30 534
#note From Michael's last play, I determined exactly what his rack was. He wouldn't make the play he made if he had two A's, but he would if he had two E's. But if he in fact had two E's he would have bingoed. So his rack was MAESTRO. This means that he has a 50% chance of drawing into A1 (P)ROTEASE and a 50% change of drawing into 11H AEROSAT. Because of this, FRIGS is my play, since it ensures that Michael only has a bingo 50% of the time, and that he must see it. Michael is much more likely to see AEROSAT than he is PROTEASE, though I think he would have seen PROTEASE. In any case, with perfect information in a pre-endgame, I made the right decision! But in actuality, it's possible 11I FRIGS for 24 was better, since it gives Michael much less points back with his rack of ROSEATE. Hopefully I can do things like this more often. If I draw E, he doesn't bingo and I have many outs, and if I draw an A, he either finds PROTEASE or I also have two outs.
>Michael_Fagen: AAEORST H11 .OARS +18 320
#note I got lucky though, and he didn't draw the E. This is -4 to SORTA 12J, a word Michael didn't know. He tried to block CLE(F) many times but realized each time he was giving me a new out, so gave up and played this.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEL B1 .LEC +12 546
#note And he had missed this anyway, so it's all good.
