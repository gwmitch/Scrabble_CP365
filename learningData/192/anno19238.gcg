>Chris_Tallman: CINNOPZ 8F ZINC +30 30
#note Decided to play it here to avoid ZINCS/ZINCY hooks to the DLS's, I guess. Pretty sure ZINCO is good in Collins; a tiny part of me just wanted to slap it down here haha.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?EHNRTW G6 WH.TENeR +69 69

>Nigel_Peltier: ITTX 6F T.IXT +19 88
>Chris_Tallman: LNNOTUV E9 NOT +17 71
#note Another really unfortunate draw. NOT keeping LNUV and exchanging LNUV keeping NOT are the 2 highest-simming plays,  lolz.
>Nigel_Peltier: ELMY J8 YLEM +30 118
>Chris_Tallman: EELNNUV K10 LUV +22 93
#note Chickened out on VENULE! Thought only VEINULE... Even so, LUV is not even close to a good play; the NENE leave sucks.
>Nigel_Peltier: DIY D8 YID +20 138
#note Looks like he was setting up MY with YLEM!
>Chris_Tallman: AEEEGNN I5 E.E. +14 107
#note Not a good play; was too afraid to open things up, and I kinda need to gamble a bit here. VEENA/VENGE is one option, but I think I'd play AGENE 5J if I could do it over and just blow things wide open, keep EN, and hope for the best. 
>Nigel_Peltier: MU 12K .UM +16 154
>Chris_Tallman: AEEGNNR C7 NAG +18 125
#note I guess I'm just making random plays at this point - lots of things are better than this and it doesn't do anything.
>Nigel_Peltier: AEINO M9 ANO.IE +18 172
#note I guess he's dumping vowels here, but this seems prettay aggressive imo
>Chris_Tallman: AEEFNRR 14J FAR.R +32 157
#note I saw lots of A's left and picked this over FRE(E)R. Maybe FR(AY) A8 is a good idea too, idk.
>Nigel_Peltier: DR 8A DR.. +24 196
#note That looked like bad news to me...
>Chris_Tallman: AAEEINS 15J AE +9 166
#note Bite the bullet and play ANISE O11 given DRAY? I didn't think so; given the openness of the board, I wanted to counter-fish and hopefully get a bingo of my own. Either way, I'll be at a disadvantage after the upcoming few turns unless I get really lucky.
>Nigel_Peltier: ACEORST O8 COATERS +89 285
#note :(
>Chris_Tallman: AEIINOS H4 IN.O. +14 180
#note H6 IONISE is sick! My play seems ok; everything is under 2% now though.
>Nigel_Peltier: FU B6 FU. +16 301
#note Partially blocking the D
>Chris_Tallman: AAEIOSS 14G SEA...... +26 206
#note It seemed hopeless from here, so I gave up and went for style points lol
>Nigel_Peltier: HKOP 3F KOPH +26 327
>Chris_Tallman: AAGIOSW 2G GOA +21 227
#note I liked this play, forking and keeping a little hope alive.
>Nigel_Peltier: EGI A4 GIE +11 338
>Chris_Tallman: AEILSUW 5C WILE +16 243
#note Right idea, but lol LWEI C4 :|
>Nigel_Peltier: ABDDEIL 1I ADDIBLE +92 430
#note Good game thank you well played thanks bye
>Chris_Tallman: AEIQSSU D1 QUAS. +48 291
>Nigel_Peltier: ?BJRTV L7 JaB +15 445
>Chris_Tallman: EIS 2L SEI +16 307
>Chris_Tallman:  (RTV) +12 319
#note I drew poorly enough that this might have been unwinnable, but I certainly didn't do myself any favours with my plays either. 9-6 and back in the pack after my awesome start now.
