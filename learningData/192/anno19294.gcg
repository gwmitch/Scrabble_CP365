#note Leave sucks, but G(Y)TTJA is half that.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EIOW H8 .OWIE +12 46
>Ryan_Fischer: EIMPRTT 11D TEMP. +18 52
#note I saw PETTI.  I don't remember why I passed it up.  For me, MET gives back way too much.

>Ryan_Fischer: IIKRTTT A4 KR.IT +42 94
#note So that happened.  At least his bingo bailed me out.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABNRU H1 UNBAR. +27 143
>Ryan_Fischer: BFINRTT 12B FRIT +20 114
#note Played here because down I needed some sort of volatility on a rapidly closing board.  I don't know how sound my reasoning here is, though.

#note So he blocked V(A)NNING.  Back into the bag we go.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AIQ M2 QA.I +28 277
#note At this point, it seemed to feel as if Matt had XRAY# vision, 'cause he blocked MO(D)ELING, too!  Three Ts on my rack, then three Ns, I really wasn't feeling too hot about this game.  And now I'm down 112.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGILMNO N1 MIG. +39 204
#note MO(W) is an interesting option, sure.  But I think I need to get lucky and score to have any hope of catching him.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EOS O1 OSE +37 314
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ELNOOY K7 LOONEYs +70 274
#note NEOLOgY is a little more defensive.
>Matthew_Bernardina: VV C5 V.V +13 327
#note Well, that's unfortunate for him.  There's still a glimmer of hope.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEHLORR L9 HERO +33 307
#note Really wishing that D at 15A was a B right now.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EF B14 FE +23 350
#note Closing it down.
>Ryan_Fischer: CELNRSU M12 NU +10 317
#note According to champ, I had the right idea.  It recommends just fishing off the N.  At first I was thinking of fishing for DECURIONS, but figured I needed to go for something more sure.  I saw this possibility instead and needed to create some sort of distraction and hope for the best.
