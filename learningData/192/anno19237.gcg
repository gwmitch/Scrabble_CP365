>Chris_Tallman: AEFISTV 8G FIVE +20 20
#note First time playing the E-train. I was in for a ... well, you'll just have to see. I lied about going straight to board 1 too; that was after this game. 
FIVE and FAVE are close - the A is better to keep but FIVE takes the R, which makes it worse defensively. Meh. Maybe 8E is better to avoid those hooks to the DLS's, but idk

>Eric_Tran: AEEGINT I2 AGENTI.E +66 66
#note Eric takes one extra point and opens some more stuff. I might have played NEGATIVE, but from what I know of his playstyle, this kind of aggression is standard for him.
>Chris_Tallman: AIPSTTW H1 STAW +47 67
#note Debated between taking the points with STAW and keeping a bingo leave with 4H P(E)WIT. Both are simming closely. Quackle also suggests just TAW for 24, which is a little crazy but just might work!
>Eric_Tran: GHORU K8 ROUGH +29 95
>Chris_Tallman: AAIIPTY 13K YIP +29 96
#note I saw PITAYA/ROUGHY and almost played it, but that huge hook is pretty nasty to open. I didn't see PI(TA)YA F2 though, which is simming best, keeping a decent AIT, or APAT(H)Y, which scores the most. YIP is an alright play, but I prefer PITAYA F2, I think. Eric said he wan't sure if I knew ROUGHY, hence making his play of ROUGH slightly better.
>Eric_Tran: ETV J2 VET +38 133
#note Pretty devastating, since I had the X lined up for J2 :(
>Chris_Tallman: AAILRTX H6 IX.A +24 120
#note Lol, comical miss of the same word for 5 more at G7. I wonder what Eric must have been thinking here.
>Eric_Tran: ENOOZ N9 OZONE +43 176
#note Eric continues to throw caution to the wind hehe. I think he was debating at first whether to put the O on. 
>Chris_Tallman: ADILRTW O8 DRAW +42 162
>Eric_Tran: ABKN M6 BANK +28 204
>Chris_Tallman: DEIILRT N2 TILDE +22 184
#note Either fish or score with TIRLED or TIDIER. This play is the worst of both worlds and a clear mistake. 
>Eric_Tran: ?ADLMOT 1A DOLMaTA. +89 293
#note Kinda froze here and didn't think of holding until a few seconds too late. It looked pretty familiar, but since I know that -ATA endings are usually already pluralized and I knew Eric's reputation, I should have challenged this. Props to him for trying it and getting it by me though!
>Chris_Tallman: AGIIRUU -GIIUU +0 184
#note Yes, I just drew that. Deserve it for obvious reasons though haha. 
>Eric_Tran: EOPT 2B POET +27 320
>Chris_Tallman: AEEINRR D1 ..RE +12 196
#note Everything is under 1% here, but it seems to early to throw in the towel. I tried to create some hard to block lanes with this, but maybe just go all-out and play RA(P)E M11 despite it likely just losing me more spread?
>Eric_Tran: BCESU 10D CUBES +27 347
#note This does a pretty good job over destroying my new lanes.
>Chris_Tallman: AEINNRR O1 RANI +22 218
#note I decide to throw in the towel for real now and just play to cut spread by blocking this scoring spot and scoring 22 (my highest scoring option lol)
>Eric_Tran: IJQ 11I JI. +11 358
#note Obvious-seeming Q setup, but I was so focused on playing for a bingo that I missed it completely :(
>Chris_Tallman: ?EEGNOR I11 .OG +13 231
#note To be fair, the best play that blocks the setup scores 2 points and does damage to my leave. The sim wants me to play CONGEE and open up a 3x3 lane, which actually is a good counter-threat to his setup and might allow me to block it more effectively next turn if he feels compelled to block it. Instead, I try to create another easy lane to hopefully get a bingo down :(
>Eric_Tran: AQ 10J Q.A +63 421
>Chris_Tallman: ?EEINOR D7 ERE.tION +70 301
#note Yay!
>Eric_Tran: HOSUY 15D SHOYU +47 468
#note I actually didn't know this word before it was played here. Now I know SHOYU and CHANOYU :)
>Chris_Tallman: AFS 14L FAS +51 352
#note Stopped recording racks after this.
>Eric_Tran: CEILNU 14B LI.EN +23 491
#note The best play by 1 over LUC(R)E 8A
>Chris_Tallman: DLMR 13C M. +16 368
#note Also the best play by one
>Eric_Tran: CU 6K CU.. +8 499
>Eric_Tran:  (DLR) +8 507
#note This one was a meltdown on my end from TILDE on, and Eric took full advantage of it. Through 13 rounds, this was probably my worst played game of the tourney (but wait!) :)
