>Jason_Li: ABTTU 8D BATTU +20 20
#note There were 8 people in the division I was in at club, and the top 4 players were Jason, me, Emanuel and Michael. Of course, Emanuel convinced Bernard, our club director, that it made sense to pit me against Jason twice in a row, since it gave Emanuel, who was in 3rd, the best chance to win. This wasn't true. Emanuel playing Jason or me gave Emanuel the best chance to win, but Emanuel was content with playing Richard, since he liked his chances against Richard more than against either of us. These pairings were inherently unfair for most everyone in the division, but especially for me, who was playing the toughest possible field even before I was in 1st place. 
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIOPUX 9A PIXIE +28 28
#note I felt like I had to consider so many plays here. I ended up considering 9A PIXIE and F8 (T)UX. I felt like EIIOP went wrong more often than OU, especially on the respective boards that each play created. But I don't know why I failed to consider E5 IXI(A). That looks like a good play. I still prefer mine though, as extra volatility addresses my leave better.
>Jason_Li: ?AFGLOT I2 FLOTAGe +70 90
#note I wouldn't have challenged FLAGTO(P)s*
>Joshua_Sokol: DEJKOUU 4H J.UKED +52 80
#note I think I would have played KO(P)JE A7 if I had seen it, since I was unsure of JOUKED, and sure enough, Jason challenged.
>Jason_Li: IQ -  +0 90
#note but this time, I won the challenge. That hasn't happened in a while.
>Joshua_Sokol: AENOORU K4 .ORUNA +20 100
#note Now that I'm slightly more back in the game, I decide to start going for turnover + leave to bingo soon, as it seemed Jason didn't have an great play he was scared of me blocking, or else he would have taken a bit longer to challenge, perhaps. But if I take that route I should play UNROO(T) at 5D rather than this. 
>Jason_Li: IQ H1 QI +38 128
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHLOOY A7 HY.O +36 136
#note I miss EPOCH far too often. That's a much better play that HY(P)O or LOO(P)Y, the other play I considered.
>Jason_Li: HOP 3L POH +26 154
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEFLOT J2 FO. +33 169
#note 2K COTED looks good here. This does hit a lot but not nearly as much as it doesn't and instead I'm forced to make plays that do not score.
>Jason_Li: BDE 2M BED +28 182
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEELOT 8K .OTED +21 190
#note 2F CO(IFF)E is a nice play. I should probably play it, too. I really didn't know what to do here as you may see from my play. 7C COTE looks better than this, 5K (O)DE as well, but I was really clueless anyway. 
>Jason_Li: EIMRRT B2 RETRIM +27 209
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CDELLN H8 .NCaLLED +83 273
#note I almost played UNCULLED instead. Not sure if Jason would have challenged, but it's not a word. 
>Jason_Li: ACILSTW 15E WIL.CATS +65 274
#note nice find.
>Joshua_Sokol: EENNUVY A1 VENUE +36 309
#note And in my case I don't even look for a bingo, which I really need to stop doing with this sort of rack. If I see UNEVENLY I'm in such better shape. Now I have to worry about the Z-bomb for a while. 
>Jason_Li: IOR 5F RIO. +13 287
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRYZ 14J ZAIRE +103 412
#note Nevermind about that Z threat... I might have tried HYPOAZINE* if ZAIRE was blocked. 
>Jason_Li: AISV O12 VISA +48 335
>Joshua_Sokol: AEMNNSY 12E MAN.Y +10 422
#note It seems right to block as many bingos as possible and not rely on outrunning, so this play seems right. He still can bingo after this, but I reduce it to a strict minimum. Wrong. I don't understand why I didn't play MEAN(L)Y in the same spot. That's what reduces him bingoing to a strict minimum. Everything just about wins here but I am sacrificing a bit of win% that I shouldn't sacrifice. 
>Jason_Li: AGNOR C1 ORGAN +29 364
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINSS 6K .EINS +7 429
#note My time was out and I wanted to play SEA(MANLY). I doubted KORUNAS' validity though. SINE is better obviously.
>Jason_Li: EGW 11D WE +18 382
#note right play, even though he missed SEA(MANLY) and probably W(IS) at L13. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AES 13K SAE +16 445
#note -2, D4 SEA
>Joshua_Sokol:  (G) +4 449
