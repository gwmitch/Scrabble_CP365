#note the board seemed too open to bother sacrificing points to block, but this play sucks. there are very few vowels left so racks like EESU or EOSU can fill in nicely for a bingo. keeping the Y cripples my bingo chances. maybe OKAY?

#note wasn't totally sure what to do, but quackle seems to like it. wanted to minimize exposure to Q, but if I do draw it the A goes with it well.

#note this was a real stumper. it had been a long day (I was directing the tournament as well) and I don't know if I gave this the effort necessary to determine a best path. from his body language, I had a strong feeling that he didn't have the Q, which I ended up ignoring. my logic was that I could score decently with QIS if I picked the Q, and if he had it he would be in big trouble. but he should probably be able to outrun me from here if I pick the Q even with QIS. in retrospect, maybe just VOE at G7 saving some plays like AWING and CAWING? if I really trust my read I think that's the play. otherwise I think this is an OK try.
>Mike_Frentz: AAHIRTT 4G AIRTH +20 423
#note his actual rack. he has a single play that wins 7/8 in a vacuum - ATTAR at M2 is 7/8. however, my last play strongly suggests I don't have the Q, so mike wanted to find an endgame that could work in that case. however, this isn't it because of SNOW/VUGS/YAW. AIRTH at C10 does win with the Q in the bag, but at the cost of giving back QIS in a lot of endgames. He may just be 2/3 to win and hope he misses the Q.
