>Opponent: AEILRR 11H .LARIER +16 16
>Bill: FGIIJMZ -FGIIJM +0 14
#note I was disappointed but not surprised that FIZGIG got blocked. There are plenty of perfectly reasonable plays here but I felt like going for the 60+ points and not having a crappy rack. It seemed reasonable to risk losing tempo since he just drew six and I know he didn't leave an S or blank.
>Opponent: EEIMRTT K4 REMITTE. +70 86
#note It was sort of annoying that he drew a bingo after that.
>Bill: AEISTUZ 4H AZU.ITES +88 102
#note It all works out though.
>Opponent: LOO O1 LOO. +12 98
#note Not sure if he didn't know LAZURITES or just wanted to make the board less volatile. His word knowledge is good.
>Bill: GHINQRU 8K .HING +39 141
#note This keeps the QU combo and sets up a possible 44 with an I draw, but QUERN for nine more keeping the GI for CLOGGIER is also tempting. For what it's worth they sim really tight. A downside to QUERN is possibly giving opponent really heavy nonbingo plays at 14J-N.
>Opponent: HY J10 H.Y +30 128
>Bill: ANQRTUY 2J QUART. +70 211
>Opponent: ADEG N10 G.ADE +22 150
>Bill: CEKNOPY H1 COP.Y +36 247
#note I missed L10 PINKEY, picked this over 5D POCKY. I think the reasoning was just feeling safe with a bingo-plus lead and a scoring tile in hand.
>Opponent: NOW O12 WON +24 174
>Bill: ABEJKNV O12 ...K +33 280
#note I played this without much deliberation and it's definitely the right play in a vacuum, but in actuality he reacted to his draw very negatively as I was about to play. As long as I can trust that it wasn't a very good act, I think it's absolutely worth a try to exchange down to EJK and try for one of the four R's/blanks for JERK (110 or 106 with a blank). Unfortunately I only thought of this a turn later.
>Opponent: IIUU -IIUU +0 174
>Bill: ABEJNOV G5 BO +11 291
#note One of the most shameless setups you'll ever see.
>Opponent: AIN 1L NAI. +12 186
#note He might have a distant chance if he plays ANI here. That highlights how reckless the setup was (my defense is that it's just a club game).
>Bill: AEJNNUV F6 JUN +51 342
>Opponent: FIOSU 8A FUSIO. +30 216
>Bill: AAEENSV I11 .AVE +16 358
#note This game has not been about playing cautiously and I'm not going to start now.
>Opponent: EW H14 WE +20 236
>Bill: ?AEEINS A8 .IANcEES +80 438
#note Couldn't remember FAIENCES.
>Opponent: EM 7M ME +16 252
>Bill: AADDRSX 9K .AX +43 481
>Opponent: DEEILNR C1 REDLINE. +70 322
>Bill: ADDIRSV 2B D.VAS +22 503
#note Best endgame.
>Opponent: ?BFOPTT G13 FOB +22 344
>Bill: DIR 15L DIR. +19 522
>Bill:  (PTT?) +10 532
#note Chosen for non-S-containing-sevens defense and because I've got the hard part of the CLOGGIER extension.
