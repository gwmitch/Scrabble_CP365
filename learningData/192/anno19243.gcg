>Evans_Clinchy: AALOPPV 8G PAV +16 16
>Chris_Lipe: BEILO J6 OBELI +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AILMOPR K6 MOR +23 39
#note Spent a while looking for a longer word that fit here, but there were a bunch of possible hooks and I got confused and didn't wanna use too much time. MOIRA is the thing I missed.
>Chris_Lipe: EJTU G7 U.JET +23 43
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGILLP F10 PAL +23 62
#note Sim prefers PALAGI# by a hair. I liked this better - AGIL is a sneaky-decent leave, and the board after PAL offers a number of nice hooks for it. If I draw an N, for instance, I could hit an -ING bingo down column F.
>Chris_Lipe: ADW E9 DAW +31 74
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGIILS L8 SILAGE +28 90
#note I spent a while evaluating scores and leaves and hemming and hawing over different types of plays - score little and keep the board tight with something like VAGI, or play big and open with SILAGE. Turns out I was missing a far better play - GLA(MOR)ISE, which is fantastic.
>Chris_Lipe: IQ D8 QI +24 98
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEFIRT C9 FERIA +35 125
#note Appears to be best-ish. I very much like the board after FERIA. Wait for him to open first...
>Chris_Lipe: KZ 13K Z.K +32 130
>Evans_Clinchy: AENOTTY H11 TONEY +34 159
#note Sims best. No need to give back an easy TWS lane with something like YATE# B10 or NETTY 14B.
>Chris_Lipe: GOR 14H .RGO +20 150
>Evans_Clinchy: AEHNOTU B10 HOTEN +51 210
#note Didn't see UNEATH# 14A, but this is a smidge better anyway.
>Chris_Lipe: AO I7 O.A +17 167
>Evans_Clinchy: AEFNSUV A6 VENUS +30 240
#note I never, ever, ever play this way, but I thought it was worthwhile to sacrifice a lot of equity here and make a defensive play. I saw SNAFU 15K for 39 and AVENS 15K for 48, and FAUVES in the same spot as VENUS, but I gave it a long think and ultimately decided VENUS was better. It's really easy to control the board and stay ahead from here on out - I'm up by 73 after this move, and his only places to bingo are in lines F and N, both of which likely score little and give me big counterplays back to a TWS, so I'll still be ahead. The AF leave guarantees I'll have at least one vowel and scoring tile. The sim hates this play, but I really can't imagine losing after it.
>Chris_Lipe: AACEI 15K AECIA +36 203
>Evans_Clinchy: AEFNRRS N7 FARRENS +79 319
>Chris_Lipe: BDNUY O3 BUNDY +20 223
>Evans_Clinchy: CEEIIMX A14 EX +29 348
#note Maybe IMINE 13E, holding onto the X for later. Either one is decent.
>Chris_Lipe: TU K4 TU... +14 237
>Evans_Clinchy: CDEIIIM 4I CI.ED +16 364
#note With the blanks unseen and him fishing, it made sense to go uber-defensive here.
>Chris_Lipe: ?DGIOTT F1 DOTTInG +63 300
>Evans_Clinchy: ?HIIMOW 1D WI.Ow +36 400
#note Lazy endgame - whiffed on WIDTH and WIDISH.
>Chris_Lipe: ELNRS 13A L..RNS +22 322
>Evans_Clinchy: HIM 5C MIH. +18 418
#note Uh, WHIM.
