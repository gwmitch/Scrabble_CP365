>Phil: ?AIMOUW 8H MIAOW +28 28
>Winter: AMX 7G MAX +44 44
>Phil: ?ADNSUZ 6F ZA +35 63
#note Spent a while debating ZONDA vs ZA but felt like the consonant-heavy leave after ZA gave my ?SU a bit more clarity
>Winter: EHNRSU K5 UNH.RSE +40 84
>Phil: ?DNQRSU 11E SQUaND.R +84 147
>Winter: AEEF 10H FEA.E +23 107
>Phil: DEIJLTV L2 JILT +24 171
#note Holding the D for plays at 12k while taking out the only real bingo lane. Cashing DEVIL now seems blindly optimistic and JIVE 10b is un-thematic as fuck
>Winter: AGOTV 12A GAVOT +24 131
>Phil: DEGIVWY A10 WI.GED +36 207
#note Debated between this, DEWY and maybe even JIVY, and went with the most conservative play. Winter usually plays quickly but spent a solid 3-4 minutes on GAVOT, meaning he either sensed how unfriendly the board was already becoming, or he was spinning his wheels on a close-but-not-quite blank rack
>Winter: BE A8 BE...... +48 179
>Phil: BOPRVYY 3J PR.VY +26 233
>Winter: LLNU 12L NULL +16 195
>Phil: BEIOOUY O11 B.UEY +30 263
#note Missed ULYIE, keeping LOBO in tow
>Winter: HOOT B6 HOOT +21 216
>Phil: ADIOOPS N2 P.OID +30 293
#note I wasn't really sure what he was up to here with HOOT, so rather than take c5 PODIA for same score/slightly better leave (while still allowing big lines for both 7s and 8s everywhere), I chose to take 30 points while opening up nonvital but potentially heavy access to a triple. m2 AVO is cute but stupid at this score
>Winter: FGIT C5 GIFT +31 247
>Phil: ADKNORS O5 DORK +33 326
>Winter: ACEILOR 13G COALIER +84 331
#note Keep your eye on the unseen pool, this is about to get interesting
>Phil: AIINRST 15A .ISTRAIN +80 406
#note Take notice of the unseen pool here...
>Winter: N 15N N. +5 336
>Phil: AAEEEEE D8 AE +10 416
#note So yeah, my post-bingo draw was AAEEEEE, leaving a blank and mostly one-pointers unseen, and yet going 5-for-5 on the unseen Es saves me a ton of spread and possibly even the game. This play is necessary to block COrNIST but I did not expect him to cash his 6s in the A-column right away -- Quackle says HIE right away gains 2 points
