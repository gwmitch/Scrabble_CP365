>Joshua_Sokol: EINTUUW H8 UNWIT +18 18
#note Club tournament night. I juggled between UNWIT and exch UUW for a long time. I decided that UE was worth -5 and that EINT was worth 10, and the letters I'm giving Emanuel were worth 3, but that I was decreasing his avg. score a bit plus starting to shape the board a bit more defensively, so UNWIT was the play. I don't know why I ever thought this decreased his avg. score. That was stupid. It's close but in a do-over I would exchange. I was too averse. 
>Emanuel: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 0
#note knowing he was going to exchange I would have exchanged myself :/
>Joshua_Sokol: EFHLUUZ 11E FUZ.L +34 52
>Emanuel: COX 10D COX +58 58
#note blegh
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHLPQU 8E QUE.E +14 66
#note I chickened out of PULQUE. Big mistake. 10 points or more down the drain here.
>Emanuel: IKR J6 KIR +32 90
>Joshua_Sokol: AHHLLOP K2 HOLLA +22 88
#note I didn't want to increase the value of his S here, which I was clearly sure he had one of, so I didn't consider playing H(I)LLO or H(I)LLOA. I should have considered H(I)LLO though. He almost challenged this. 
>Emanuel: AEEMNSS 4G NAME.ESS +72 162
#note there's that S.
>Joshua_Sokol: HOPRRSV H1 PRO. +18 106
#note Most everything sucks here. I missed 3I HO(O)P and didn't consider fishing for 6 with H3 V(A)R. That doesn't look like a great idea. HOR(A) is probably better than this. Dunno why I didn't consider it. I also considered burning my s for 34 or 35 but I'm down way too much to do that, it's really valuable. 
>Emanuel: DIIM 3E IDI.M +24 186
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIORSV 13B HaVIORS +85 191
#note First time I had TOVARISH available and missed the spot for it! I think he has bad stuff so no need to keep the board too open, I think this is a bit better than 12H (T)OVaRISH.
>Emanuel: AVW 14A VAW +32 218
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABEEOR 15B EARlOBE +88 279
#note I saw the sick 2A OvERBEA(R) before he gave me a better spot. FOREBEAR plays there too

>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGOSY 1L OFAY +43 322
>Emanuel: AEEIJTT 3M REG +26 276
>Emanuel: AEEIJTT --  -26 250
#note Took me a while to pull the trigger on the challenge. It annoyed me that since we didn't have a challenge computer Emanuel was able to try and get information from Bernard, who took the challenge, about which 4 was invalid. He kept saying "ARES is good! It isn't good?" when in Scrabble plays are challenged for the purpose of not letting the opponent know which word is invalid. It was very unsportsmanlike, in my opinion, for Emanuel to try and get someone to say something about which word was invalid. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEGSTY 3M DEY +34 356
#note held and released...
>Emanuel: AG 10H .AG +13 263
>Joshua_Sokol: EGIJSTT K9 JET +28 384
#note "Of course you have an E"

Sounds like Marlon!
>Emanuel: BO L8 BO +16 279
>Joshua_Sokol: DGILNST M9 GLINT +29 413
#note Damn, L8 (BO)DING was missed. I also considered DIG M7 but I wanted to make sure I had a vowel next turn and that Emanuel couldn't make impossible to block setups like _____ next turn (I was paranoid), but it's valid to not want to have to burn my S after a hail mary setup like (BI)O or (BI)D at least.
>Emanuel: AG 12M .AG +6 285
#note I guess annoying things are still possible though so DIG still looks competitive with GLINT. BODING though.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIIINST O7 TIDIN. +24 437
#note I had the win, I decided to go for spread, which this does much better than plays that empty the bag such as TIDIN(G)S
>Emanuel: DNRU 5D DURN +13 298
>Joshua_Sokol: AAIOPST 4C OI +10 447
#note seems I mistracked and had him with TUNE. So this is 3 off
>Emanuel: EENT 14F NE +14 312
#note -2 to 3A TEN/NET
