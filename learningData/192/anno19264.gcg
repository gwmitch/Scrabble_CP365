>Joshua_Sokol: DEFLMPU H4 FUMED +30 30
#note Welcome to my first game against fellow annotator and Polish tall person, Mark Przybyszewski! To begin this game I chicken out of playing an inflection of a 5 that I forgot the validity of, FLUMP. I also chicken out of FLUMED! This is going to be a good game...
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ABHITWY G7 WAB +27 27
#note Mark's racks are obviously provided as well. Playing 5 tiles here with BAWTY or WITHY looks good here, but I won't discount WAB here without knowing his reasoning for it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELPPRST 5G P.RPLEST +74 104
#note No more PER(FUMED), which I actually missed, and which would be a big factor in favor of playing FUMED first turn keeping PL if FLUMP or FLUMPED were invalid.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: HIORRTY L3 TH.ORY +32 59
#note N2 YIR(T)H looks like a strong play here. So does this.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADGGHS F6 GAGA +25 129
#note Good thing HAGG(AD)DAS* was blocked, I would have played it. Hebrew words are so hard, too many variant spellings and yet not enough. GAG in the same spot has great merit cause of its defense and keeping a vowel for rack safety. I don't know, perhaps I should play GAG.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AIIRRTU 8L .URT +21 80
#note what a terrible draw. I2 URA(R)I or K1 URIA(L) look better than this, though.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEHIJS E9 JaDEISH +96 225
#note Mark's reasoning for not challenging this is that div 1 players my age just know the book from front to back. When he said that I kind of felt bad, cause I have one of the worst word knowledges in div 1...
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AIINRRR 15E .AIR +21 101
#note another terrible draw
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEEISV N8 .EVISED +38 263
#note I7 DIVE looks like a good play here as well. I chose to just score and end the game quicker at this point. I think I made the right decision.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: IINRRTZ 12D N.RTZ +48 149
#note Mark probably has to play N3 RI(T)Z here and hope to bingo next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABLMNWY N2 BAW.Y +42 305
#note 14B ABY(S)M looks better than this since it scores and takes out a spot that may be used later to keep the board alive. But it also increases bingo% for the immediate future, which I don't want. Interesting. I missed the play though so I don't know. 13I WAMBL(E) may even be right.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: IIILNQR O1 QI +37 186
#note scored as 36
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFLMNN M12 AMEN +25 330
#note I missed a few things here and didn't quite know what to do. I didn't know LEMAN, but M11 LEMAN looks like the correct play.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AIILRTV E1 TRIVIA +21 207
>Joshua_Sokol: DFGILLN 1A FLIN. +27 357
#note I believe this was necessary.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?IKLOOS L10 ILK +28 235
#note J4 S(P)OOKILy was most likely missed. 14B kIO(S)K scores 52 though! Wow.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGLNTU 3A LAUD.NG +22 379
#note If I can play more tiles I will. It looks like this or DAUT(I)NG in the same spot are similar in value. DAUT(I)NG reduces bingos more but the bingos it leaves score more and the leave isn't as good. I guess I should have played GU(I)LD though even though it doesn't block the F which is a remote line anyway and probably won't win Mark the game with the leave I'm keeping. It does reduce the amount of time Mark bingos in total.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?AOOOSX K12 OXO +18 253
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEEOOT -EEEOO +0 379
#note Making sure he can't bingo twice.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EO M2 OE +15 268
#note This was something I worried about earlier. Now it isn't much of an issue.
>Joshua_Sokol: CCENOTU J2 COU.E +17 396
#note There are only two consonants left in the pool, so this doesn't really block much besides the P. I still like it though.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?AEENOS 11D O. +5 273
#note and in fact I blocked three bingos. This looks like the right play.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINOOT A3 .ENTIC +27 423
#note For some reason I messed up my tracking though and thought that his N was an L. That's why I didn't play LECTION, which would otherwise be the right play. 
>Mark_Przybyszewski: ?AEEENS 4C NE.E +24 297
#note -3 to 14B SEN(S)AtE, a hard find
>Joshua_Sokol: OO O6 OO. +8 431
>Joshua_Sokol:  (AES?) +6 437
#note I can't keep missing or chickening out of bingos consistently and winning games like these, nor can I get away with consistent phonying. This win was a fluke aided by the way I drew and a stigma that Mark had about players my age.
