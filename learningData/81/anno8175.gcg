#note Getting cute.  Judy's just exchanged, and if she doesn't have a bingo, I want to force her to have to open.  While I didn't get burned, this didn't exactly work out as planned, and it made for a very unusual game.  My best play here is I8 TUI, which I didn't even look for.
>Judy_Newhouse: ACLN 11D CLAN +25 51
>Jim_Burlant: EHILOST D11 .LOTH +28 84
#note No-go #1.   Q prefers D9  LOCH 18 and D10 ICH 16 and does not like this at all.  Admittedly, this game might have taken a much different course if I had played or LOCH.
>Judy_Newhouse: ISW 15A WIS. +30 81
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOST 14A OM +21 105
#note No-go #2.  C12 AMIS and E13 MOA  are preferred by a little bit.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had as many no-gos if I'd opened the board up more with those plays.  This comes in within 3 points, however, and I do like the leave.
>Judy_Newhouse: BI C13 BI. +24 105
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIRST 12G SERIATE +69 174
#note My 75% winning chances are about to be significantly reduced.
>Judy_Newhouse: DEFGGIR N6 FRIGGED +84 189
#note Despite her lead Judy is still only winning 42%.
>Jim_Burlant: AGIINOS O8 DO +21 195
#note No-go #3.  This is decent but my fixation on the triple caused me to miss a much better play:  I8 DUI 20.  
>Judy_Newhouse: EHM 11K HEM. +34 223
>Jim_Burlant: AGIINOS M3 AGIO +15 210
#note Hmmm.  Q likes 12B OIL.  I'll concede that AGINS is a very nice leave, but isn't that play  more than a little reckless with BCFNNNNRRRRSTTT?? unseen?  Of Q's choices GONIA M3 (which I didn't see) is probably best, and this play sims roughly 1/2  point down on GONIA.
>Judy_Newhouse: DELNO 4J DON.LE +18 241
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIINS -II +0 210
#note Definite exchange situation, but Q says I should also throw in the A and it docks me quite heavily for this choice.  I'm winning 26%.
>Judy_Newhouse: NT K3 T.N +6 247
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINOS J3 A.O +8 218
#note When I saw this rack I was really beginning to think this was the one game on today's docket that just wasn't my game to win.  Fortunately for me Judy was struggling just as much as I was, so I could hang in.  Anyway - I don't know if I like the sim results here.  Even against an inferred N, 7G OVA is best.  This sims roughly 2-1/2 points down.
>Judy_Newhouse: AO 7G A.O +8 255
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNPS 13L AN +17 235
#note Q likes  PAN 13K, but that would render my S next to useless.  Perhaps I gave away too many scoreboard points with this choice, but this worked out quite nicely.
>Judy_Newhouse: EJT O1 JET. +33 288
>Jim_Burlant: AEINPRS 14F PANIERS +71 306
#note Best, back up to 51%.
>Judy_Newhouse: FK G6 K.F +15 303
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEEOQV 15G BE +22 328
#note Best, and I'm now winning 75%.
>Judy_Newhouse: W 2N W. +10 313
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEOQUV 3I Q.. +22 350
#note I've always wanted to play VAQUERO...and I guess I'll still have to wait, as this is no-go #4.  Q despises this play, and from a rack-building standpoint I can understand why as I'm breaking up Q and U.  But I like this play for its defensive value.  Besides snuffing out any bingos ending in D on row 2, she is now trailing by 37 and has absolutley nowhere to score.   Q's preference is 8k EQUID 25.  
>Judy_Newhouse: NRTU 6C TRUN. +11 324
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEOUV C1 OVUlA.ED +74 424
#note Perhaps a hair reckless, as VOE leaves me up 38 points and her only bingo line is through the U, but Q says that I'm right to put the bingo down (though D1 VAPOURED scores 84 - I didn't see it).  Q says the best plays are the D1 bingos like fAVORED, VApOURED, and SAVOURED and I can see why...or Y, as this threatens to give up too many easy comeback points if Judy has a Y.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?AIPRSY 1A PR.SY +33 357
#note Judy told me her rack after the game, and she took her clock down under 30 seconds before putting this down after having given up on the game.  She realized post-mortem that her best play would have been to fish off the Y at 7B and force me to decide what to block.  Had she done that I would have come back with CLOY just in case there wasn't a 3x3 I wasn't aware of in there, and that would have allowed her an out bingo of PyURIAS.
