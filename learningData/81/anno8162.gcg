>Ryan_Fischer: GHINTTU 8D HUTTING +80 80
>Brett_Haughney: ?BEOORS C2 BOOkERS +80 80
#note C3 sORBOSE 82 -- interesting.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEIOOSS 4A CO.S +18 98
#note I just sensed I was missing something.  Something I haven't seen yet.  I6 CO(N)IOSES 63.  This doesn't rank.  Q wants O(B)OES.
>Brett_Haughney: DEIJ 2A JI.ED +30 110
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIOPS 1D POISE +40 138
>Brett_Haughney: DELOV A4 .LOVED +36 146
#note Oops, it's (C)LOVEN.  Thisz bogus.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAILRT 2H TALARIA +70 208
#note Ah, the winged sandals of Greek mythology.  I just solidified this word a few days ago, oddly enough, so I was fresh on the fact that no mouse doth it take.
>Brett_Haughney: DOY 3I YOD +25 171
>Ryan_Fischer: CDIMOUZ J8 .IZMO +37 245
#note ZOIC is just dumb.  Saw it, passed.
>Brett_Haughney: ?FGNRSU O2 SURFiNG +91 262
>Brett_Haughney: ?FGNRSU --  -91 171
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDILUY K9 DAY +42 287
#note I can play CLOUDY or DAY.  :)
>Brett_Haughney: ?FGNRSU H4 GUNF.ReS +63 234
#note Last turn he had FURLONGS too, but I blocked it.  Also, FURRINGS.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEGILU L11 CUGEL +28 315
#note Q wants CUE L11 20.  Thisz bogus.  He held but let it go.  It's with a K only.  So we both got away with one phony.  Fine by me!  :)
>Brett_Haughney: ENRTX 14I EXT.RN +58 292
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIIOR O10 AERIE +20 335
#note Or G6 IO(T)A 17.  This protects me from disaster just a little bit more... I think.
>Brett_Haughney: AAEEMNR N10 MAE +25 317
#note D8 (H)ERMAEAN 78.  Next is (L)EAR which I mentioned as a possibility postmortem.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIINOP 15F FOIN +23 358
>Brett_Haughney: ABK 1M KAB +35 352
#note Or B6 KA 39.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEHINP B6 PA +27 385
#note Toss up between this and PHI.  I chose this to keep a better leave going to the end, but am not sure if it's worth the sacrifice.  2nd is L2 (R)HEA 25.
>Brett_Haughney: EILNRTV E5 RIV.LET +40 392
#note Told me his 7th letter afterwards.  Thisz a very nice play, but missed VIR(U)LENT in two spots to likely seal the deal.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHINQT 5G Q.INATE +32 417
#note I think QUAINT is better on second thought.  Let's see what Champ says...  Yeah, I didn't track at all this time around.  Q actually says play HIE, blocking WEN, then leaving QUANT to go out, or QAT for 27 if he blocks with W(AD)E.  Clever.
