#note I thought sacrificing the 5 points by playing here instead of at C2 was okay, but you can probably do just as much damage on the C column anyway. Definitely the wrong play, and I ended up getting burned for it.

#note Seemed like my best option - I have the last S and there's no A's left. My opponent also probably has the Q and will need to ditch it quickly on this board. In a 4-play sim this wins 18%. 13G K(I)T is best, I assume because it blocks the Q spot. In reality my opponent would still be able to play QU(o)D at A6, and my next rack would be GIIORST which I can't win with.

#note Taking the points won't score enough now, I have to hope to play on the O column when the bag is empty. According to Quackle nothing I do will win (assuming my opponent plays optimally).
>opponent: CDDHLNU A8 .UNCH +16 373
#note 13J DU(T)CH and J13 (UH) both win.
