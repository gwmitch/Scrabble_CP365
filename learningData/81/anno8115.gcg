#note so i wanted to try to draw moorages or moorings, and i also didn't want her to bingo. i spent a long time here - probably down to 4 minutes or so. vigs is better for taking out bingo lines.  too many cross purposes here. with this lead, should probably just focus on shutting board down.

#note as it turns out, vigs would've still left her with punitive. by some crazy luck, the draw works out in my favor.
