>Jim_Burlant: IILOOWZ 8G WIZ +30 30
#note Horrid leave but there are too many points to pass up.
>Chris_Cree: AIOT 9F IOTA +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: DILNOOU 10E UDO +21 51
#note Best.  UNDO 10D is also a strong choice and the sim is neck and neck between them.
>Chris_Cree: BEIJLPR -BEI +0 26
>Jim_Burlant: EILMNNO 11C NOM +18 69
#note Best on static evaluation but Q prefers that I open up with LOMEIN 11G 23.  Sim results make it clear that this is not a terrible play; I'm barely 2-1/2 points down despite giving up 5 on the scoreboard.
>Chris_Cree: ?DEEISS 12B DESpISE +76 102
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNP 11H PLAINED +74 143
#note Q prefers the 10I placement by roughly 1 point.
>Chris_Cree: BKR M10 B.RK +20 122
>Jim_Burlant: FIJNRST 14J FRIST +43 186
>Jim_Burlant: FIJNRST --  -43 143
#note For some reason, confused this with FRITH, which was utterly stupid of me - there's nothing to be gained by playing FRIST (if it's good, which of course it isn't) instead of FIRST.  
>Chris_Cree: GM J10 M.G +12 134
>Jim_Burlant: FIJNRST 13I JIN +25 168
#note Convinced that FRIST* was still good, opting for safety.

#note HEFTS!
>Chris_Cree: ABI I5 BAI.. +17 182
>Jim_Burlant: HORTTWY J2 THROW +38 241
#note Despite my bumbling, I'm still in good shape.  This is clearly best and I'm still winning 76%.
>Chris_Cree: FIRY C9 FI..RY +32 214
>Jim_Burlant: EGHIRTY K5 YEH +40 281
#note Best, and I'm winning 80%. 4j RIGHTY also worth consideration. Despite my mistakes I've got a solid lead and there are lots of good tiles in the pool and hopefully I'll land some of them.   If I draw an N I've got the makings of a good rack.   
>Chris_Cree: ADELQSU L1 QUADS +59 273
#note Chris told me after the game that this was his rack.  This brings Chris's winning chances back up to 297%.  However, my next rack in conjunction with his completely turned this game in his favor.
>Jim_Burlant: AGIILRT M2 TI +10 291
#note This positoin had me deer-in-the-headlights stumped.  The plays that are begging to be maed from this rack, B6 GRAIL and B7 GLIA did not appeal to me - I thought they threatened to give way too much back.  Also - those unseen U's caught my I.  Remember that my tracking reflected what was unplayed and still in my rack as well as what was unseen, I felt that I should close that down and force him to open up.   Q disagrees, saying that B6 and B7 plays are the ticket.  Whatever - given his next rack, it wouldn't have mattered a whole lot.
>Chris_Cree: ?AEEELT D3 ELEvATE +69 342
#note Well, he certainly opened up.
>Jim_Burlant: AGILOOR N2 ALGOR +25 316
#note B12 DOOR is the sim winner.  This choice sim mid-pack.
>Chris_Cree: CEU 14F CUE +16 358

>Chris_Cree: AO 10L O.A +14 372
>Jim_Burlant: EINORTV 3C V.T +12 342
#note Trying to set up the O hook that he's going to have to block.
>Chris_Cree: ELNOR F2 LONER +16 388
>Jim_Burlant: AEINORX 5B RO. +3 345
#note Believe it or not, I have a win...but it's pretty tough to see.  The only thing I saw was XENIA O5 which lost once he went out.  The win for me is RAX E5 leaving EINO.  His only V dumps either give me out plays of ENVOI if he plays VAV, or they don't score enough to block my ION(ON)E L7 out.  What I was trying to do here was hope he mistracked, having me on something like AAINX and tried to dump his V cheap which would let me sneak away with the XENIA out.  Oh well.  Too many mistakes.
