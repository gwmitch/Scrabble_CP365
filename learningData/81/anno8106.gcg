>Joel: EY 10F YE +31 130
>Dave: AIKLOTV K3 KILO +25 137
#note I debated between this move and KI 7A.  But I felt like KI didn't give me enough bingo chances, and the board wasn't going to be that conducive to big scores.  Also, with an A in hand I had the possibility of L column plays after KILO.
>Joel: EHNTZ 4H ZEN.TH +56 186
>Dave: AAGNOTV 5D TONGA +23 160
#note My mind was stuck on GRAVA* on column E.  I missed the really good play there: VAGRANT.

#note After already suffering two nine-timers from me in our first game and a half, Joel exclaimed, "Are you going to triple-triple against me again?!"  If his bingo had ended in an S, I would have.
>Dave: ACEIMPT 15H AMIC. +27 400
#note This is not bad, but with both blanks still out there, perhaps playing an extra tile with APIECE was better.  Joel said that this time I blocked his triple-triple: EPIGEOUS.
>Joel: ?EIOPSU E8 P.EvIOUS +74 475
>Dave: ?EGIPRT 12C GR.PIEsT +72 472
#note I think I just missed that this could be played at 12A for four more points.  Or maybe I didn't want to give shorter plays to the triple?  I think it's a bad error, because I need the points and playing at 12A leaves the board more open for a possible out in one.  With the way the tiles fell, Joel would still have won 504-503 with best play.
>Joel: BDDRRST 11K D.RB +14 489
#note Both this and BIRD 13K are best and amount to the same thing.  But not BARD, which gives the E hook on column O.
>Dave: AEFNO M9 FO.A +24 496
#note I thought I had to block DIRTS, but I missed Joel's second out.  There was nothing I could do anyway, so I might as well force him to find the tougher word.
>Joel: DRST 14D D.RST +10 499
