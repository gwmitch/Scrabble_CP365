>Toh_Weibin: AEFIILN 6I FI.I +24 75
#note VOW reeked of an S setup. I could not play FINIAL for that reason. Didn't think opening the TWS up was wise either.
>Tony_Sim: AEPV 4L PAVE +33 84
>Toh_Weibin: AEEILNN O1 AIN.E +15 90
#note Chose to play safe again.

>Toh_Weibin: ?CDEILN 1H DuLCINE. +83 173
#note This is the best move - however there's a cool word playable through F, R and T.
>Tony_Sim: X 2N X. +36 143
>Toh_Weibin: ADEEKOY D11 .OKEY +36 209
#note Missed KEYPAD D8. POKEY is IMO much stronger than YOKE 12A...
>Tony_Sim: ANZ 15A ZAN. +48 191
#note Except when this happens.

>Tony_Sim: EIORSTT M8 STOITER +75 266
>Toh_Weibin: AHIRSTU 1A RAHUI +42 330
#note Was thinking of taking out the S hook for STOITER, but was not entirely sure of RAHUIS or STOITERS. Didn't want a double challenge making me even more unsure of both words. Besides, this scored enough and left me with the S, perhaps to try STOITERS later. HIATUS/ STOITERS wouldn't have cut it because of the Rs in the bag.

#note Funny how JOTS 12H appeared top in CP.

>Toh_Weibin: EEEILTY (challenge) +5 400
#note Had to try taking out the spot after his fish, whether it was good or not. I was reasonably sure of it anyway (as compared to RAHUIS earlier)
>Tony_Sim: AEGLN A3 .ANGLE +30 357
>Toh_Weibin: EEEILTY L12 EYE +23 423
#note Played to block bingos through the E, which I felt were more possible than bingos from HAWM or HAWS.
