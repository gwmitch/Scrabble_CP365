>opponent: ADM 8G MAD +12 12
>scott_jackson: DEIIPTU 9F DUI +12 12
#note 7H PIU has a better leave and is worth a bit more, but I don't like sticking the U under the TLS. Quackle likes it significantly more than my play though. Probably because it gives a good bingo line with DEIT on the 9th row.
>opponent: EGTY H7 G..ETY +14 26
>scott_jackson: AAEIOPT 7G A.IO +17 29
#note Best is 11E APA(T)ITE 36. Didn't see it, though I looked for a 2x2 for a while. My play ranks fourth.
>opponent: AAEGIST 11E AGI.ATES +86 112
#note yeah that would have been better...
>scott_jackson: ?AEEPRT L6 PRETA.tE +70 99
#note Plenty of choice obviously, but I choose this as there's a small chance it would get a challenge. Held but accepted.

#note Best valid play is 12C WIPE 29
>scott_jackson: BEEEINN 12C BENE +21 135
#note At the top along with 12A BENNE. I should probably play the latter given I know my opponent's rack - the few plays he could utilize the B with give pretty bad leaves.

>scott_jackson: ADKOSTY 14F KOA +37 292
#note best. YOKED has a much better leave but I can't afford to keep the F14 square open with the Q and X still unseen.
>opponent: NORZ 13I ZON.R +48 282
>scott_jackson: ACDRSTY 8K D.CAY +33 325
#note CUSTARDY! The only bingo you can make with this rack. I know the word, but it's not exactly easy to see. My play gives around a 75% winning chance vs. 95% for the bingo.
>opponent: EIQUVVX 3C QUIVE. +38 320
#note opponent's actual rack. Best is exch. IQUVVX and exch. IQUVV. Best non-exchange is N7 V(A)V. 
>scott_jackson: DFIORST N10 FROST +47 372
#note Whoops, should have played FIRST instead to deny the EX hotspot. Wasn't thinking.
