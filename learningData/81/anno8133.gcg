#note This game is for the 2011 Eastern Championships Collins division title.  
>Matt_: BIOPQTV 7C BOP +19 19
#note 1 over for 20.  Hoping to cash QI next turn somewhere.
>Steve: AEEGP 9C PEAGE +29 57
#note Took awhile to decide whether to play the 2nd E.
>Matt_: INOQRTV 10B QI +35 54
>Steve: LLOU B10 .UOLL +28 85
>Matt_: ?NORRTV 11A T.RNOVeR +75 129
#note Very lucky to get a U in such a good spot.
>Steve: EEKS H11 .EEKS +30 115
#note I should be noting the front hooks here.  I don't.
>Matt_: ABDEFIS I13 FA +24 153
#note No I for BASIFIED.  Trying to keep the rack together to bingo again.
>Steve: AEOSTTU 7I OUTEATS +63 178
>Matt_: ABDEISY O4 BYS.I +49 202
#note Did see BAYSIDE* and thought of the tourney locale in NY.  Blind to the YU hook at J6, but this drew a 10 point challenge, which really helped me keep close later on.
>Steve: EENW A11 .WEEN +49 227
#note Ouch.
>Matt_: ACDEIOT G13 DO +21 223
#note For some reason I was thinking SOCIATED* was #, it's only SOCIATE/S.  Again I'm trying to keep the rack togetheras much as I can.
>Steve: ACILRZ 5I CRAZIL. +42 269
>Matt_: ACDEILT L3 LA.I.D +36 259
#note Yeah, I looked at this rack and missed ALL of the 7's.  I also didn't see the CREEKS hook.  And I thought I was being so clever with this.  CITADEL 10H is the play.  I didn't deserve to win this game.
>Steve: JO 6B JO +29 298
>Matt_: ACEIOTT 3G TACTI.E +26 285
#note Thought about STOICATE*, as I was starting to get desperate while the board got closed down.  I liked that this opened up another lane and scored at the same time.  
>Steve: GIMOTU 4B GOMUTI +20 318
#note Good defense here.
>Matt_: ?FINNOR H1 FR. +18 303
#note As he blocked my INFeRNO, I felt the need to open another lane, even if the F isn't a great bingo tile.  This also scores 18, and with the X out, I need to keep contact with him.
>Steve: GISW 15H .WIG +17 335
#note Blocking another lane.
>Matt_: ?AEINNO 5D ANI +16 319
#note The play of the game.  He called this "masterful", although I wish I had put more thought into it.  Basically, I'm threatening that I have the X, and I can play TIX#/XI for 51, which could be enough to overtake him if I score with the blank as well.  With the only bingo lanes being through the F and starting with a C (which I finally see at this point), he makes his choice.
>Steve: HMNRRSU 6F NUR +10 345
#note He decides I'm more likely to have the X, and takes his chances by blocking the hot spot.  I'm pretty sure this is what his rack was, and he can play something like HUMS 3A for big points.  I luck out that the X remains in the bag...
>Matt_: ?EEINOV 1D OVEr.INE +64 383
#note ...and that he didn't block my bingo lane.  Olaugh asked me how I knew this word.  It's pretty high playability, so I must have seen it by review of high-play 8's.  Maybe it showed up on JT.  I don't know, I just knew for certain it was good, and that even if I draw the X I've got the win.
>Steve: AHHMRSX 3C HAH +39 384
#note Either this or MAX 2B.  Rough draw for Steve at the end.
>Matt_: D 13A ..D +8 391
#note Such a crazy yet fitting end to the tournament.  Steve was a great and overworthy opponent in the finals.
>Matt_:  (RSMX) +26 417
