>Travis: ELOPTVX F10 PLOT +22 142
#note I played this hoping to get more value from my X later, and the Z if I drew it.  I didn't think it likely that Roger knew "PLOTZ".

>Roger: ?ANORST 14A ROANeST +75 121
>Roger: ?ANORST --  -75 46
>Travis: ABDEFOS E11 ABED +24 210
#note Completely missed the bingo, although even if I saw SOFABED I may have had to consider its validity.  ABED was a pretty horrible play by Quackle's standards, but it apparently didn't prevent me from racking up the points later.
>Roger: ?ANORST M11 T.RN +8 54
>Travis: ADEFORS 15G FEDORAS +91 301
>Roger: ?AOSZ N10 ZA +33 87
#note Very thankful not to see ADZ.  I pointed it out to Roger after the play.
>Travis: ?AEMNST O9 bATSMEN +91 392
#note I tried a little to get that M in the sweet spot, but I chose to play BATSMEN just because I liked the word.
>Roger: ?IOSTUW K2 OUTWIl.S +72 159
#note It's interesting to see the bingo isn't the best play here.  I think I would agree with Quackle to save the blank and play OUTWIT (not that I would have been so keen to consider both).
>Travis: EGILNOP D5 ELOPING +67 459
>Roger: EIL 14B LIE. +10 169
>Travis: EHIJRWY 4H WHI.EY +38 497
#note I wasn't sure WHITY was a valid Scrabble word, or I would have saved my E.  Really just looking for the A or O draw at this point.  I didn't consider WHIP, but that play seems less appealing to me anyway.
>Roger: ACN 15A CAN +19 188
>Travis: ADEIJMR 2J J.RAM +60 557
#note I saw MAJORED but I liked the DEI rack leave better, and I didn't really want to put that M next to the triple either.
>Roger: FHIS E2 FISH +30 218
>Travis: DEEEINR 2A REDE.INE +78 635
#note I almost missed this one - nowhere to put NEEDIER, and the F had to fit just perfectly.  Just another piece of evidence that I was extremely lucky this game.
