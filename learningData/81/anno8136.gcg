>Toh_Weibin: CEIKLNQ 8D CLINK +28 28
#note QI looks the best now, especially after his play.
>Andy_Kurnia: AEEIORT E4 AERO.ITE +82 82
#note He'd have ETAERIO anyway, if I played QI.
>Toh_Weibin: ABEEQUU 6C BU.QA +36 64
#note BA(R)QUE is the move here.

>Andy_Kurnia: PTUY 10B PUT.Y +24 140
>Toh_Weibin: AEFILOY 5G FOYLE +27 118
#note FOYLE looks quite weak, though I'm not sure what's the best here. CP suggests the hard-to-spot (C)O(T)YLE or (C)O(T)YLAE D8

>Toh_Weibin: ?AEEEIM A1 E.MA +27 187
#note CP suggests leaving the TWS open. Can't say I disagree.

#note Happy to spot this!

#note CP suggests an exchange,

>Toh_Weibin: FLNORRS (challenge) +5 334
#note Tried this as a desperate attempt to draw a bingo. Perhaps C9 R(U)N would be a bit better, but I was not at all hopeful.
>Andy_Kurnia: DEIOSTT L8 DOTIEST +75 458
#note Well, he'd have had DOI(L)TEST anyway.

>Toh_Weibin: NORS 9I ORS.N +14 362
>Toh_Weibin: NORS --  -14 348
#note SORN/FLIRS is the obvious move, but I thought it might have been SORNE/SORNED/SORNING. Whatever, the game wasn't mine anyway - so I tried this. It's UR SON, btw.
