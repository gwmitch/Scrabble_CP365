>Chris: GHLRRSW 8G OI +4 4
>James: EFIKTUW F8 KUFI +26 26
#note Best - good leave and best score. 
>Chris: ?AILLRS 12F SALLIeR +76 80
>James: EEOTTUW H12 .OWE +21 47
#note I'm not sure why I didn't play OWE or TWEE 11J. I have a feeling it's because I wanted to create as many openings as possible to play bingos through. 
>Chris: MNO E9 NOM +25 105
>James: AEPSTTU 7G TAP +14 61
#note I chickened out of UPSTATER L5. Even then, ATAP G12 is still better than TAP because it scores better the W and E are pretty useless to me for bingoing. 
>Chris: ACENNTY G11 C.MO +30 135
>James: EEENSTU J5 UTE +11 72
#note Quackle likes NEE J6 best, though I wasn't sure if two Es or EU would be more likely to frustrate my efforts. NEUMIC 11B is actually a very cute play that I like a lot, but also missed. It actually goes about opening new lanes instead of just doing something on old ones. 
>Chris: AELNNTY M9 QUASI +55 190
>James: AEEHNRS F14 HE +30 102
#note Best play - the point now is to try and get a bingo down, and it wasn't like HE N10 would be more beneficial.
>Chris: EHLNNTY I11 A.OE +21 211
>James: AEENNRS K2 ENSNARE +77 179
#note Probably better is RENNASE K2, since the E isn't put next to the triple letter. 
>Chris: DHLNNTY 2J V.NIAL +34 245
>James: EEHLTTW 4H WEL.H +34 213
#note Best - it opens up new lanes (which I need). THE 1M is favored by Quackle and if worth considering but if I play that I am basically signalling to him that he can start closing up the board. 
>Chris: CDNTTUY 15A RERID. +24 269
>James: BDEIRTT B10 BETID. +30 243
#note Firstly, RERIDE is bad and I had BETIDE 15A if I challenged. I held that for some time but decided to play BETIDE at this point since I would get to play it anyway. Quackle likes BID J11 but I thought BETIDE also opens more lanes and keeps pace with his score, both of which I can use at this point. 
>Chris: CNPTTUY A7 VERA +25 294
>James: ?AJNRST M1 J.N +20 263
#note I missed JURANTS - a bad miss, though the J would be put next to a DWS, which Chris has a good chance of using as there are 3 Os unseen. Still, that's the best play. 
>Chris: EGGINU O1 G.UEING +30 324
>James: ?ARSTXZ C9 ZAX +43 306
#note Best play. I need to keep scoring in order to put some side pressure on Chris. 
>Chris: CGIOPTY 5E TOYO +19 343
>James: ?ABIRST 3C BaRISTA +79 385
#note And I get lucky and have a bingo near the end to give me an almost unassailable win.
