>Jackson: ?AILNRX 8H ReLAXIN +92 92
#note This is a quintessential 'take the risk or play it safe' moment. Playing ReLAXIN at 8C is probably the most safe, but sacrifices 14 points. I often argue with a friend of mine about where to place denizen if given that word on your first turn. I believe in playing the game safely, even if it means sacrificing 10-20 points. I wanted to try something new this game. Also, since quackle is much better than I am, I know that it will take a number of big plays to beat it. If I get an S next turn, the game might be mine.
>Quackle: ADEERRZ 7I RAZE +38 38
>Jackson: EFIIMPW 9M FEW +24 116
#note I could have completely blocked the hook with EF (9N), but that would leave me with IIMPW, a complete disaster of a leave. Few scores some points and somewhat closes that area.
>Quackle: DDEJRSU 10G JUDDERS +76 114
>Jackson: AGIIMOP 11C IMAGO +25 141
#note Now I'll just play a bunch of tiles in hopes of picking an S.
>Quackle: INNNRRY D11 .INNY +28 142
>Jackson: AEGILOP K4 PLA.. +32 173
#note Missed EPILOG (12G). GOALIE in the same spot might have also been better than PLAZA.
>Quackle: DKNORRY 6J D.RKY +43 185
>Jackson: EGIOPTU O9 .IPEOUT +39 212
#note The S hook has been brutally slaughtered. 100 bucks says I will get an S next turn.
>Quackle: DFIINOR M3 FIN. +22 207
>Jackson: ?AGILOO E4 ApOLOGI. +66 278
#note Gotta love those 5 vowel 8s.
>Quackle: DIOORTV 14K VODO. +18 225
>Jackson: BEEHIUU F6 HIE +31 309
#note It was hard to play 3 tiles keeping 2 U's. The 31 points helped.
>Quackle: BINRSTV 4A VIBR.NTS +86 311
>Jackson: BEGRTUU 15A BUR. +27 336
#note It was either BURY or BUGS (1H). Kwak likes BUGS.
>Quackle: AAALOTW A3 A.OWAL +36 347
>Jackson: CEEGHTU H1 UGH. +24 360
#note I wasn't completely confident in UGHS. I thought it might be an exclamation.
>Quackle: AEEQTTT N2 TET +13 360
>Jackson: CEEIMOT 14B ME.O +22 382
#note Tie game! I missed MONIE in the same spot as MENO. EMETIC (12G) is best, in my opinion.
>Quackle: AEENQST O1 QATS +54 414
>Jackson: ACEEIST M12 CE.E +14 396
#note Just as I am waiting for Quackle to make its next move, I realise TET was a setup for QAT or QATS. Darn. Quackle likes CEDE the best. I felt I played reasonably well this game, except for the QATS mishap.
>Quackle: CEEEN 12G EN +13 427
>Jackson: AIST 13G SATI +20 416
>Jackson:  (CEE) +10 426
#note Should I be happy or disappointed about a 1 point loss to Quackle?
