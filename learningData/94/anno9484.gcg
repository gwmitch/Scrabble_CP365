>dacrON: ALLNQRR -LLQR +0 0
#note I got some of Lester's racks. Fill in the ones I didn't get with LOTS AND LOTS OF VOWELS!
>Lester_: ABIO 8H OBIA +12 12
>dacrON: AENORSW 9H WO +16 16
#note WO vs WON
>Lester_: AEENNRT 10G NEATER +19 31
#note Don't think I'd play this, but I see the point.
>dacrON: AENRRRS 11I RARE +22 38
#note I am not good at balancing leaves in situations like this. Do I fish off two Rs, or keep a decent leave (NRS) and take a guaranteed 14 more?
>Lester_: DEJKNUY 7D JUNKY +34 65
#note Lester noticed JUNKED after he hit his clock.
>dacrON: DGNQRST J7 Q.N..R +21 59
#note I'm not actually sure that trading is any worse, though I think the frequency of bingo draws probably increases the EV of points next turn after QINTAR.
>Lester_: EHU D7 .EHU +15 80
>dacrON: DGISSTV 8A GIV.S +29 88
>Lester_: OOTU A5 OUT.O +6 86
>dacrON: DNNOSTV -DNV +0 88
#note i really don't see anything worth playing here.
>Lester_: ADEX 12J .AXED +49 135
#note Scored as 46. For whatever reason, I only counted him as having put down ()XED, hence my 46.
>dacrON: LNORSTT 13M LOT +13 101
#note let's be honest. the pool is very AEI heavy. I don't feel like I'm gambling too much on drawing two vowels, but I'm not entirely sure what else there is worth playing here.
>Lester_: ADEG 14J GAED +14 149
>dacrON: ENPRSTT B3 PENT +14 115
#note I saw STREP, but wasn't sure if I was making it up. I'm sort of shocked my win percentage is so low, according to Quackle. I like this play (2nd to STREP, obviously), but is there anything else worth doing?
>Lester_: ADEI C3 IDEA +27 176
#note Lester said I couldn't have made a play that helped him any more. Ha. Notice where all the vowels are? :)
>dacrON: EILRSTZ D1 ZITS +59 174
>Lester_: IIIIIW -IIIIIW +0 176
#note Lester was going to play WIZ, but we had been coffeehousing the whole game, and I said I didn't have many vowels still. He decided to play the odds.
>dacrON: ?BEFLNR 10B FL.B +17 191
#note FRo(Z)EN was definitely second on my list, but this seemed too good to pass up. However, looking at it again, I wonder if this locks me in too much on needing to bingo at L2, and also conceding him the Z perhaps too often. But I think I can bingo enough with ERN? often enough just the same. Close call here.
>Lester_: FI 1B FI. +15 191
#note Ouch, missed it again!
>dacrON: ?ACEINR L2 CARNIEs +72 263
#note consiered (V)A(L)ERIC, but I really just want to get the bingo down at this point.
>Lester_: ?EHLNOV 3K H.VE +20 211
#note Lester felt the situation was getting pretty desparate, but I think HAVE just gives up too many hooks. Especially with O? to work with, this board isn't dead yet.
>dacrON: CEEIOSY O1 COSY +50 313
#note (V)E(L)OCE is new to me! Was excited to play SYCE, but I can't exactly complain about this.
>Lester_: ?ALLNOR N2 L.AN +17 228
#note What to do here, from Lester's POV?
>dacrON: EEIIMOU C8 .O.UME +30 343
>Lester_: ?LMORST 13A TR.MoLOS +60 288
#note MeRLOTS scores the most.
>dacrON: ADEIIIW 12C .AWED +39 382
#note 2 better than blocking P(I)G.
>Lester_: GP 6K P.G +6 294
#note Lester breaks 100 in bottom 6, me top 7. Both of us break 200 in 11. Just an ugly game.
>Lester_:  (III) +6 300
