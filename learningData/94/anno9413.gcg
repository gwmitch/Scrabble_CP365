>James: BDIILOT 8G LIBIDO +20 20
#note Best - there isn't much worth keeping from this rack. that being said, the placement of LIBIDO is tricky. I picked this to minimize the opponent's playback (the highest scoring play puts an I next to a DLS) and at a 2 point tradeoff it seemed fine. 
>Yukari: AFINOTV 7F MAX +25 25
>James: ?EGITTW K6 WI.GET +22 42
#note Tricky move. WIDGET scores well but leaves a volatile T? leave and leaves an easy counterscore spot. TEW 7J is an interesting alternative but GIT? and 6 points less are both considerations. All in all, I prefer my play because it also sets up potential extra bingo lanes, which TEW does not. 
>Yukari: EIMOPST 12F MOPIEST +90 115
>James: ?EELOTU 11A EELpOUT +68 110
#note Missed TOLUEnE 13B. Again, if I'd looked harder, I could have avoided potentially giving up a 3x3. 
>Yukari: AADEIRZ A8 HIV. +30 145
>James: ?FINOYZ 10J Z.IN +33 143
#note Honestly, I wasn't sure what to play this turn. The Z is a good tile overall, and can work with quite a few bingos. PONY H12 does open it to let me potentially use the Z for a bingo next turn (and in the absence of such, leave me with ZEIN 14F or ZEIN again), so it merits considering. Quackle slightly likes FUMY, which makes some sense because that does keep me in the game. 
>Yukari: AEILRRV C7 RIVA.LER +82 227
>Yukari: AEILRRV --  -82 145
>James: ?ACEFOY C9 FO.EY +30 173
#note Well, lucky me for the challenge. H12 PACY, FOLEY and 13G OAF all look to be good options, but I think FOLEY gives the best chances to bingo next turn. 
>Yukari: AEILRRV L3 VILE +19 164
>James: ?AABCKU H12 .ACK +36 209
#note Quackle likes PUCK - AAB? has more bingo probability than ABU? I guess. 
>Yukari: AEJNNRR 3J WA.Y +26 190
>James: ?ABEHQU 6D BAH +31 240
#note QUA B6 is favored - playing off the Q looks better than holding EQU? at this point according to it. That does make some sense, because BEH are easily playable off for points while QU- may be harder. 
>Yukari: EJNNRRS D3 DRU. +14 204
>James: ?CEGLQU I11 C.G +13 253
#note Best, I think - EQLU? is a good leave and I have sufficient leave to threaten something else. Quackle likes CIG but also likes CUDGEL 3B leaving Q?, which i am confused by, because there isn't much of a benefit to holding Q alone on this board. Personally, I would've thought QI 7J would be favored over CUDGEL. 
>Yukari: EFOR 4G FORE +13 217
>James: ?DEELQU D11 .LED +17 270
#note The thought here is to hold EQU? and go for a bingo on  another turn. PLED is a defensive form of this while DEL 2I is the offensive version. QI 7J is also worth considering too because DEELU? may be more adept at yielding bingos. 
>Yukari: AENPRST N4 PARENTS +79 296
>James: ?AEENQU O1 QUEAN +52 322
#note Best play - the Q's value is called in here. Notice that the move would be harder if Yukari had played TREPANS instead. 
>Yukari: JO C2 JO +24 320
>James: ?ADNORS 2E SADiRON +71 393
#note RODSmAN 2E is better for the defensive value. Neither play is likely to lose much, though. 
>Yukari: IT 1G IT +12 332
>James: AENNORT 9A .N.ANTE +15 408
>Yukari: AEGIRSU I6 GI.E +23 355
