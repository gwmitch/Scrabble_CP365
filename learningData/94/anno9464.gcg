#note I... shouldn't have put the A on the star.
>Steve_Bush: AIOT 7F IOTA +19 19
>Ryan_Fischer: ADENORW 6G WEND +29 47
#note 6F OWED 32.  Q doesn't like this too much, but it sure makes it hard to score without an S or B.

>Ryan_Fischer: ELNSTVY B4 L.VY +18 160
#note L(E)VY instead of N(A)VY to bingo easier.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEHNST C7 ETHANES +86 246
#note If I didn't play LEVY I'd have to find ATHLETES.  Yeah, Ls suck.  Hehe.
>Steve_Bush: AEEJ A7 AJEE +39 182
>Ryan_Fischer: CFRRUVX 12J .RUX +26 272
#note Okay, VEX instead of CRUX.  Was fixated on the double R when I shoulda worried more about the CFRV.  I guess.
>Steve_Bush: IKO 4D KOI +30 212
>Ryan_Fischer: ?BCEFRV -CFV +0 272
#note I don't know why I didn't just play through with BREVE, FEEB, FEVER, VERB, or BEEF.  I got the blank, got greedy, saw I had the B, and got a really stupid idea in my head.  Lesson learned.

#note HEBE is 5 more.

>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGHNRU --  -39 306
#note With two Ns left, H(E)RN is best.  I got really paranoid here.  Saw the newly open line and couldn't block and so I got greedy and played the phony.
>Steve_Bush: ENSV O11 EV.NS +36 311
#note Now if he gives me an E, though, I have HARANGUE (or UNCHARGE, which I didn't see).
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGHNRU 15L HUG. +12 318
#note Still paranoid and low on time, I block.  Dumb.  HA would've been just fine, as would HUNG.

#note What a way to blow a game and $50 bucks.  Yuck.
