>Chris_: CGKLNRZ 8F VAU +12 12
>James: ADDINTW G7 D.WT +14 14
#note It's a tossup between this, DAW in the same spot and WUD H7. None of the options sound that much better than the other. I picked mine because I thought DAW took too many hooks and that ADIN sounded okay as a leave. 
>Chris_: AHM 9G .HAM +18 30
>James: ADEILNP 10I LIP +15 29
#note Bad miss on all the words to the triple - ALPINE, ELAPID, ALIPED, all far better. I got too fixated on my unplayable bingo (PLAINED). 
>Chris_: EEGZ 11J GEEZ +42 72
>James: ADEENOY M9 DO.EN +34 63
#note Best play - best leave and best points. 
>Chris_: FU 12L F.U +22 94
>James: AEILOTY N9 OY +29 92
#note The options on this play are daunting but I picked playing OY because it scored well. TOY just seemed to be giving an extra 6 points to the triple...
>Chris_: AEEORVW O3 OVERAWE +105 199
#note Oh well. Hindsight is sugh a great tool. 
>James: AAEILRT F10 AIL +9 101
#note  Thinking about it, I shouldn't have been too eager to grab too many points with this play. AT 10F leaves me with a perfectly strong leave given the open letters (E, R) and the AT to play a hook to. LAV is an interesting idea since it also forces the board to open as well.

#note Rats. 
>James: ADEIRTT 15F ATTIRED +90 191
#note Best - only spot to play a bingo. 
>Chris_: NRTU 14C TURN +10 291
>James: BEHIINU E11 HEI. +26 217
#note I have to keep scoring points and opening up new lanes. With HEIR, I was hoping to draw a G and use BGINU in some fashion to make an -ING bingo to GHI. Quackle likes the more straightforward HENBIT C9 though, because it scores points. I think that it is also likely a decent play since TURN signifies some fairly horribly letters in Chris's hand (or he'd at least play a 5 to get the bonus). 
>Chris_: ACCGNO D7 COGNAC +40 331
#note Great find, and one that pretty much kills the game. A bingo chain is about the only way I can get back into this one, now. 
>James: BEEINRU 8A BRI. +18 235
#note I'm really at a loss on this kind of board. Trying to come up with new plays is beyond me. I picked BRIO to score a little and to give me a little shot through the R or B for extra bingo lanes (given the vowel-heavy EENU leave). 

Quackle likes NUB N1, which I guess could work if I get a 3-3 from drawing a G and Chris somehow can't block that at all (cough). REIN or RUIN 15A sound like decent ideas because they create a bingo lane with another R, but I already have one in that position. Very tough to come up with anything useful. 
>Chris_: EFIX B4 FIXE. +31 362
>James: ?EEGNRU 6H hUNGERE. +62 297
#note HUNGERER is not good. I missed MERENGUE 5H. 
>Chris_: ABET A1 BATE +27 389
>James: AQT C2 QAT +30 327
#note I can't figure out what my tiles were from hereon - the game was lost anyway. 
>Chris_: IJNS D1 JINS +65 454
>James: AIMNOPS 1D .IMP +15 342
#note Since the game was lost and it was a best of 3 finals, I just wanted to see if Chris could break 600. He looked like he was about to smack me.
