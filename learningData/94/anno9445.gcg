>Jerry: JNU 8G JUN +20 20
>whatnoloan: ILNTTTT -LTTT +0 0
#note Or TTT, but I prefer INT on this sort of board. 
>Jerry: II -II +0 20
>whatnoloan: DFGINOT I6 FO.D +11 11
#note Keeping a good leave after he probably opens (with or without a bingo).
>Jerry: ENW J5 NEW +20 40
>whatnoloan: AGIKNNT 4G TANKING +87 98
#note Wasn't sure about placement--it was unclear which one was more defensive.

>Jerry: GV M7 V.G +13 93
>whatnoloan: EEINORU 3C NEURI.E +24 191
#note Wanted to keep the bottom of the board tight while scoring well.
>Jerry: IILORST E5 STRO.ILI +90 183
#note Noo.
>whatnoloan: AMOSTUY 10G YOU +28 219
>Jerry: ?ACEEIU O8 .EUCEmIA +80 263
#note Noo.
>whatnoloan: AMOSTVY N12 YOM +30 249
#note ATOMY does open up a decent sevens lane. I don't know, it might be right. 
>Jerry: AHH D10 HAH +35 298
#note One disadvantage to YOM is that it allows plays such as this.
>whatnoloan: AAEOSTV 13B OVA +22 271
#note Opening some new lanes.
>Jerry: ADRW M12 DRAW +32 330
#note And this.
>whatnoloan: AAEESTZ 4A ZEES +52 323
#note Not especially happy with anything here, but 52 points seemed fine. 
>Jerry: IIST A4 .ITIS +42 372
>whatnoloan: AAACLTT C7 ACTA +14 337
#note Something like ACTA F11 seems to kill my chances pretty well. Here I am turning over tiles to get some of the better stuff.
>Jerry: IQ 14A QI +26 398
>whatnoloan: ?AELOTX 15A iLEX +87 424
#note I also considered some sort of fish. X(U) 10N might be more appropriate, for example, though it might be tough if I draw the A. 
>Jerry: ABEGMRR 11H REBAR +26 424
#note Jerry tunnelled in on the FONDUE spot, so he missed BERM and BARM, which would have made for a very close game. 
>whatnoloan: AOPTT 10K TO +6 430
#note Missed AT 12J.
