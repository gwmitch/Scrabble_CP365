#note H5 VAL(U)ATOR 62.  Ugh.  VOLTA, slotting the V?  Maybe.  Just learn to find the bingo.

#note Creating an -ST-ending bingo line.  Or SS, less likely.  Best statically, too.
>Cynthia_Seales: FHO 10B FOH +28 199
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AGRSTZ 14F ZAG +41 163
#note Last game of the tourney, morale down, lack of caring firmly intact, thought I'd roll the dice.  Not too smart.  Champ says... it's best?  Well, the Ys are gone, and I've got an S.  There's plenty of Es and Os, though.  Oh well.

#note Nice find, just one letter off.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DENSUW 14J WE. +14 352
#note I got to see a lot of what was left and where because of the phony.  It was too much to process and I was quite low on time.  Troubling.  I would be getting some vowels, and needed to lose the W.  Hard choice.  Champ with inference says 9A WE 10.  Nice as long as her 7th isn't an A or O, and it's not as if she'll score much there anyway (and I likely could).

>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADENSU O4 SNArED +28 380
#note Yeah, I saw SNAfUED but doubted it.  Lemme ask myself this question: why would I doubt such a silly word.  It's only BECAUSE of Scrabble that I'd SEE such a word in the first place, so of COURSE it's good!  ...and I managed to go over by a minute and change AND U-stick myself.  Very apt summary of my tourney performance as a whole.  :)
