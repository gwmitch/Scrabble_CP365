#note I didn't really think to play through this junk and lose my S.  I thought I'd take a page from the "C is good" book and keep it for a change.

#note Ugh: 15D WELT(E)REd 64.  J6 (PIX)EL 24.  B2 REWET 24.  All before this.  Now watch me self-destruct in a glorious blaze of, well... glory!

#note Okay, so I got really greedy here.  I couldn't decide on STEELIER or SLEETIER (let alone GLEETIER, TREELIKE, or ERECTILE), so I decided, hey, let's play a phony... which he so happened to know for SURE was phony 'cause someone else tried it on him.  Not to mention REpLETE was available for a quite satisfying 72.
>Scott_Garner: DOU L5 OUD +11 219
#note Then he went into the tank here and tried to block as many 8s and 7s as he could, and I thought, hey, let's make up another word!

#note (ERECTILE is still available.)  Just REELECT.

#note And so all I get is 58 points and this lousy t-shirt.  I might shoulda played one short of the TWS to hope to get the S and get back in it (with RELETTER).
