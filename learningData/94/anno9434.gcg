>James: DGILPTT 8G DIPT +14 14
#note I picked this because it was a decent leave (GLT is okay), DIPT can't be hooked onto, it scored okay. Quackle agrees with DIPT over GILT or exchanging (its other proposals). 
>Chris_: ABEII J8 .IBIAE +14 14
>James: CGLLSTT 11I G.LT +10 24
#note Trickier play - CLST is also a decent leave (but again, needs vowels, which is what Chris seems to have drawn in spades). TALC 12I may be more to my tastes because it blocks up some dangerous playing through the E, but I like GILT because I may actually need the E for a future play if this keeps up. GILT and TALC are Quackle's top picks. 
>Chris_: ?DEEMRV 9B REMoVED +71 85
>James: ACLOSTU M7 LOCUSTA +82 106
#note Best - the score (82) makes it worth playing. LOCUSTAE 13C is more defensive, which is thus worth considering as well (but is 10 points less). OSCULATE creates the same kind of problem play to a triple as LOCUSTA for 8 less and is not really worth thinking on for that reason. 
>Chris_: CIRUU D4 CURIU. +22 107
>James: EEENRSY 8L Y.RE +33 139
#note Best - it's good to take out the spot and it's also the best scoring play for me. Strange, though - had I played LOCUSTAE, I'd have YESTREEN L8 this turn! 
>Chris_: JMP 5C J.MP +30 137
>James: EENNOSS 4F ONENESS +70 209
#note Best - only bingo, only bingo spot. 
>Chris_: AFY 3F FAY +26 163
>James: AAGLNRS 2H RAGLANS +80 289
#note Best - only bingo, by far the best bingo spot (other is RAGLANS 2G for 11 less). Sorry, Chris. 
>Chris_: AENO 14L AEON +18 181
>James: ?AHOOOW 15H cAHOW +51 340
#note Well, given a 100 point lead, I just wanted to try and limit any chances Chris would come back to win this game. CAHOW looks to do that very well, because it stops any plays along that row or parallel to it. 
>Chris_: EIV O12 VI.E +33 214
>James: FKLNOOR 1L FOOL +46 386
#note Best again - points, stoping him from scoring... sound familiar? 
>Chris_: Q 7C Q. +21 235
>James: GIKNRRT H1 T...R +24 410
#note TRYER isn't good, but I didn't know. Otherwise, it's a good move given that there are no Ss left so it's hard to use the T. Also, the game's all but done pretty much.
