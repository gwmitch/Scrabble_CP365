#note Tricky starting rack. VIRUS is 24, and UN isn't a bad leave. However, I prefer exchanging to go for a bingo and I like INS instead of INRS since that just seemed a little too many consonants to hold onto for 1 vowel. 

In a way, I should consider also playing opponents, as I am playing Mark Stedman and not Schellenberg. This means maybe VIRUS is better because it's more likely this Mark doesn't know REOVIRUS, POXVIRUS, PROVIRUS or SUBVIRUS.

#note After seeing Mark lose a turn, I just wanted to get a really quick leg up for winning instead of going for a second bingo. KITBAG G6 holds L? and scores 17, which I didn't see but the 35 difference is about what a blank adds to a rack. I guess the last thing to consider is that the A is put in a potentially dangerous spot if Mark has the X, but then, it'll be my turn again. It's not entirely clear that he doesn't - from the lost HEINY, maybe OXY would've been played given the Y in his hand already but that's not something to take for sure.

#note Best - RETAX 6B is 4 more but it opens a hook PRETAX as well as opens more bingo lanes, which isn't what I'm looking for with a 130+ point lead.

>James: ABERTTW H1 WREA. +39 221
#note I missed TWEAK H1, which is better as it undoubles the Ts for a fairly strong BRT leave (as I'm pretty much supposing a vowel will be drawn). JOW 4D scores 26 as well and leaves BATTER, which Quackle likes a lot and is recommending as equal to TWEAK, but which i don't like because without bingoing, the rack isn't that great to do anything else. For safety's sake, ANEW O1 is also worth considering (33, cuts the 3x3 lane). 
>Mark: DIV N1 V.ID +8 73
>James: ABHRTTT 7H HA.T +17 238
#note THEBE 3F is better because I get to hold onto my A (I missed it, though). HAET I played to block up the I and D as bingo lanes, and because I (incorrectly) thought HAET was a past tense of a verb and didn't take S. So it was my attempt at a defense (which wasn't that great and THEBE at least does a credible job of blocking the R).

#note Best move - best overall leftover tiles I can get from this rack except for exchanging BFT or BCFT, but I don't need to at this point.

#note Best bingo choice. SELECTOR 2A creates a few more lanes.
