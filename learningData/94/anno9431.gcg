#note Best - only bingo and best points. I am so lucky. 
>Jesse: HIJR F4 HIJR. +31 57
>James: ?ACKLOO E2 COOK +37 104
#note I missed WOOLSACK 11D and OARLOCKS 11A! WOOLSACK is by far the best becaues it's 102. COOK actually is close to OARLOCKS by Quackle's estimation, mostly because it scores 37 and leaves me with the better chance of bingoing the next turns. 
>Jesse: GOS D3 GOS +30 87
>James: ?AGLMNY 11C GYMNA.aL +76 180
#note Okay, I actually thought this had some chance of being a word. My thought process was this: "GYMANSTIC pertains to GYMNASTS, so what pertains to a gymnasium? Oh, maybe it's gymnasal... wait, wouldn't that be gymnasial? Oh well, let's just play it and see what happens".

The circumstances when thsi arose were that Jesse was taking his time to play (he played in 3 minutes) and so I decided to just put it down in my normal fashion when he was done. He looked very confused when I put it down, held me, and continued to hold for 4 minutes. A good note for everyone is to not do anything out of your ordinary routine, even if you know the word is phony or good - it's a tell, like they say in poker. So, I just did my normal thing, which is look away from the board (for fear of betraying any reaction) and look at the games of other people. I also don't do the courtesy draw so I kept that up too. As it was, I was interested to see what would come of this challenge. I was in the final so the results of tihs game didn't matter to me. 

Jesse let it go. At the end of the game I asked if it was good, and he lookedl ike he'd eaten something bad. 
>Jesse: EO 7F .O.E +23 110
>James: EFIIORT C9 FO.IE +26 206
#note Best play - it scores well and leaves a strong leave in IRT. OI 12D (18, holding EFIRT) is worth considering except that it leaves an F on the rack. FROE 12A (35, IIT leave) has a lot of points but the F is likely to be played back on for about 24 or more, while IIT is by far a the worst leave. 
>Jesse: ELOW 4H .OWEL +22 132
>James: IIRRTUY F10 U.ITY +18 224
#note YIRR 12I holds the likely best leave of ITU, though UNITY got rid of the U and left me with a pair of Rs. Quackle likes UNITY over YIRR, though I think I like YIRR a little more. The other danger that results, I guess, is that in doing so, I create a lane that for a bingo for Jesse that's easier to use and also not so likely to be detrimental if he uses it. 
>Jesse: ?EEILST M1 TEnSILE +76 208
>James: EIIRRTU K2 UT.RI +10 234
#note Quackle likes TUI 1M best. EIRRT is not a bad leave, partciularly given the openness of TENSILE. I played UTERI for the better leave but I think TUI is the best in reflection. 
>Jesse: OZ 10B Z.O +37 245
>James: AEEHIRW 3I WE. +24 258
>James: AEEHIRW --  -24 234
#note I play all my games upside-down, turning the board usually only in some specific circumstances (like looking for a 9 or something). This time, I think my laziness caught up to me from before and I just gave Jesse the best way to seize the lead... 
>Jesse: IQT 2J Q.I.T +68 313
#note Like so. 
>James: AEEHIRW 1M .EW +20 254
#note From here, the onus is really on me to catch up. AEHIR is fairly good given the openings from the E along columns L or N, so I picked it. Quackle likes it best. It was a bit early to play other things like WAE or AWE C1, hoping to hook along B2 for a bingo with SEGO. WHA C1 is also not worth it because of the vowel imbalance left. I just really need to score a lot of points to keep up now. 
>Jesse: ADEIMN L7 MEDIAN +24 337
#note Jesse went through this later. He has the big lead and is trying to block me. This does a fair job of killing a bunch of lanes but a far better play for his purposes is AIDMEN. While it scores less points, it can't be pluralized and creates AE, both of which are bingo lane killers. 
>James: AADEHIR C2 HA +18 272
#note So, time to play desperately. The lanes left in the bottom right corner are ones I can't really develop without risking his further interference. HA was my way of trying to create another opening for a bingo or some other building plays to get back into this game. 

Quackle proposes playing ETA N1 (another opening, one that I can use very well with my H) or YA 14F (what better way to go out in this game than in a blaze of glory?). I can't fault them on those choices - any way you look at it, my comeback is very tough to envision. 
>Jesse: RTUV 10K V.RTU +10 347
>James: ADEFIRS 13I FARSIDE +90 362
#note And of course, I draw the bingo that actually fits. A high scoring one at that. Sorry, Jesse. 
>Jesse: INP O12 P.IN +27 374
>James: AADDLRT 1A TRAD +27 389
#note It's quite lucky that I drew As and Ds, and that he had neither or the lanes at the top are so likely to have been taken. Playing TRAD, I set up RAD B1 at the very worst next turn (for him to block, he can only play from the T or RE B1, the former likely to score nothing and the latter not playing off enough to keep pace with me since I will have the advantage of trying to play off on my turn. 
>Jesse: BEGNNOU J4 .EB +26 400
>James: AACDEL M9 E.A +10 399
#note It wins - it sets up YCLAD 14F. Jesse was very low by this time so I assumed he wouldn't see it. 
>Jesse: GNNOU O8 GN. +12 412
