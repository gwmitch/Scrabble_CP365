#note E4 CIBO(R)IA 22.  Ruled out FABRIC and COBIA.  This doesn't really rate.

#note Didn't want to play PUB considering how he's fishing.  Plays at 5K are unappealing.

#note Saw PHT and PST, didn't like 'em.  Champ does.  Also TH(Y).  Of note: 11A THu(M)PS 44.  SPY is probably better than SHY 'cause there are more Es left.  More likely I'd draw one, but also more likely he'd already have one.

#note I'd learn after the game that HE had all the vowels.  I don't know what's right here.  I was sick of fishing and missing.  Static doesn't give any exchanges.  I guess PST, ZAG, and ZAP are reasonable.

#note GUiTARS is tops, but I couldn't resist this.  Too bad it's no good.  :/  Of note: NUTGRASS, CUTGRASS, DUSTRAG, FRAUGHTS.

#note Just wanted to kill those lines and score, which I don't think is too smart right now considering how open the board is.  Static likes 12H PI(G) or BI(G).

#note An ASHY PETUNIA.  Well, this is 2nd.  Definitely wasn't expecting to draw the blank here.  PETALINE, ANTITYPE, TRIPTANE, PINNATED, TINPLATE, PATINATE, PATIENTS, PITTANCE.

#note Champ says B6 (J)EW 22.  Me, figured I'd block it up, lock it down.  All the plays are 99% anyway.  Of note: 13I W(A)D(D)IE 30.
