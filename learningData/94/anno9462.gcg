>Ryan_Fischer: ??BEGLU 8D BUGLikE +72 72
#note Whoops, it's bogus.  BULGERS, BUGLERS, BULKAGE, or any other of 100 words would do.  Heh.  This was somewhat defensive, which was why I played it.
>Pete_Zeigler: ABLNRTV E5 VAT. +14 14
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEFLO D8 .EEFALO +24 96
#note Or BEFLEA (2nd; way back).
>Pete_Zeigler: EHILOSU F8 .HOULIES +66 80
>Ryan_Fischer: AIMNOTU 9H TINAMOU +66 162
#note Almost didn't see this.  I feel like I'm playing decently this game, despite the phony.
>Pete_Zeigler: KOOT 15F .TOOK +27 107
>Ryan_Fischer: HNNPPRY 6B PYR.N +18 180
#note 10A HYP(E)R(O)N 23.  PYRONE or PYROPE at 14A.  I saw L7 NYMPH, didn't want to dangle all those hooks.  PHONE is cute, but wanted to shuck the Y.  Hence, PYRAN.  NAPPY rates a bit better there.  PYRAN sims pretty well, jumping to 3rd after a couple hundred spins.

#note Wow: C9 PHIZ 49 (!).
>Pete_Zeigler: IX 8N XI +36 165
>Ryan_Fischer: CFGHLNO 7J FLOG +16 234
#note J6 FL(EN)CH 28.
>Pete_Zeigler: ACSV 15A VACS +44 209
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDHIJN G11 HID +21 255
#note Totally whiffed on 6L HAJ 37.  Thought about JADIN(G) leaving CH, then got greedy and tried to fish for JACANA.  Another problem with HID is I'm killing lines I might need if he bingos elsewhere.  Which he does, blocking JACANA, which I miss, anyway.  HID sims 4th behind HAJ (1st).
>Pete_Zeigler: AERRSTY B6 .ARTYERS +71 280
#note I held and released.  Luckily for me I had just seen it.  Had to think about it for a second, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCEEJN L3 BANJ. +28 283
#note Totally forgot about JEBE(L).
>Pete_Zeigler: EEW M3 EWE +27 307
>Ryan_Fischer: CEENRRT J12 REC. +16 299
#note Figured I couldn't chance him hooking MERC.  Tried looking on column N, but couldn't come up with RENTE for 28.
>Pete_Zeigler: IO A8 OI +14 321
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMNRT 2A M..I +7 306
#note I figured I have to take a chance here to win.  A chance that he doesn't have the Q, S, or T, and I draw well into this opening and miss the Q myself or get the U with it (heh, yeah right).
>Pete_Zeigler: EGNO N2 GEN +19 340
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINRTW 1D TAWNIER +86 392
>Pete_Zeigler: EINORSU O7 O. +2 342
#note Champ doesn't try to block the Q play, I think, 'cause it's fixated on setting up an out-in-two with (M)URE and IONS for 32, ignoring my need to ditch the Q ('cause it doesn't score much, and IONS scores a good bit comparatively).
>Ryan_Fischer: AEQT 5E .ET +8 400
#note This or T(E)E to set up the Q.  He was really low on time here so maybe he'd miss it.
>Pete_Zeigler: EINRSU L9 .UNI +12 354
#note G4 U(T)S to block.  Or L9 (M)URINES to go out.
