>James: HHMNRRX -HHMNRRX +0 0
#note Quackle favors holding some of the tiles as almost all of them are useful on their own if I draw a vowel or two. I wanted to see more tiles and passed them all. 
>Kevin: EGKMRTU 9F KIF +28 50
>James: AACDETZ 10B ACETA +19 19
#note Quackle proposed ACTA, as it thinks DEZ is a better leave than DZ (it is) to the extent that the 3 points for the E are mitigated. ZA 10E is also proposed because it is the best leave but that has the worst playback and if he does play another defensive word, I'd have trouble trying to open the board up when down by a long margin. DAZE 7H is also a fairly okay leave but again, the position is potentially too dangerous for my liking at this point. Kevin is a very good player at taking opportunities presented to him. 
>Kevin: EGGMRTU 11D LABOR +29 79
>James: DEELOTZ 12B ZED +34 53
#note Best. 
>Kevin: EGGLMTU B12 .EE +24 103
>James: CELLMOT A13 MOL +21 74
#note Best - good enough leave to make it better than MOC. 
>Kevin: GGLMTUW 12G NEB +11 114
>James: CDELNTU 13I EDUCT +23 97
#note A miss - RECUT H11 is a good play for the leave alone. It also leaves the D which can be useful at 7H if I run out of options. 
>Kevin: GGLMTUW -GGLMT +0 114
>James: ?GILNSW D9 W... +8 105
#note I chickened out of LAWINGS here, forgot LOWINGS and missed WINGLETS and SWINGLE. Bad play. 
>Kevin: EORU 7H ROUE +11 125
>James: ?AGILNS K4 LIN.AGeS +82 187
#note About the same as NIGELLAS K4, I think. 
>Kevin: EIJMNSV 10J J.U +25 150
>James: AAEGIMU 8K .MIGA +33 220
#note Quackle pavors GUAIAC C5 though I like this to snap up the points. GUAIAC is more defensive and forces him to open up if he can't bingo soon. 
>Kevin: AEINOSV -AEIN +0 150
>James: AENPRUX M10 XU +26 246
#note I got greedy - LUREX 4K scores 40 and keeps a fairly good leave. It also helps to block a few lanes. Playing that, I'd have a 110 point lead and it'd likely take 2 bingos by Kevin (or a bingo and 1-2 big plays) to come back. 
>Kevin: ?AEIRVV 4E REVIVA.s +78 228
>James: AEINOPR J10 .O +11 257
#note The best thing to do here is to keep him on the back foot. JO signals bingo potential, which I certainly have on this board. 
>Kevin: DEFNOTY 7M HAT +24 252
>James: AEINPRT F3 P. +4 261
#note I saw that I had TERRAPIN but miscounted the number of spaces with the R! So Thinking on it for some time I decided to make another fish, and paid for it. 
>Kevin: DEFNOOY E2 PO.TEND +24 276
>James: AAEINRT 2B ARE.A +25 286
#note PA is favored by a large margin - this is likely because I threaten something at F1 and at D14, still. This is a useful case of not resting on your laurels - the bingo lane at the bottom is likely to be blocked unless I do something like PA to threaten another play. 
>Kevin: DFIORRY 1F GINNY +34 310
>James: HIINRTY 14F TINY +17 303
#note Quackle prefers TINIER 6A to other options. I do leave the HY, which allows me fairly good plays at A4 if I am allowed to play there, and also leaves then for YAG/HAG at N6, which is definitely worth consideration. I played TINY to try and make an easier bingo lane, but given teh three Ss there was little chance that would work to save me. 
>Kevin: DOS 15G DOS +30 340
>James: EHILORW F6 HO +28 331
#note About the only way I can come back if is I can keep making points and if he makes a mistake. 
>Kevin: EFORSST C1 F.OSTERS +74 414
>Kevin: EFORSST --  -74 340
>James: EIILRW 6N WE +31 362
#note And he did, but there's no way I can win. That being said, I shot myself multiple times en route to this point so I deserved it. 
>Kevin: EFORSST I6 T.SS +29 369
