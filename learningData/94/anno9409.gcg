>James: ADEIKMP 8D PIKED +30 30
#note Chickened out on PAIKED. That is a better play not only for the 2 points but because it leaves less choice tiles next to the doubles (K and D). 
>Ted: DERRY 9G DERRY +20 20
>James: AAIIMPU F4 UMIA. +13 43
#note UMIAK is a good leave (AIP) for the amount of points scored. The one thing to note is that exchanging is not favored by the computer even though the hand isn't very useful to do anything on this board at all. IMPAIR J4 or YAUP K9 are also better than exchanging; they start to score enough points that their relatively weak leaves (AIIM or AU, respectively) make up for the deficit. Also, IMPAIR and YAUP block up access to the TWS for now, which is a consideration that can't be ignored. 
>Ted: ADLOU D7 U.LOAD +18 38
>James: AEEEIOP E10 PEE +21 64
#note A miss on my part - PAYEE K7 and PEERIE J6 are better because of the high excess vowels I keep. 
>Ted: AV 4D VA. +12 50
>James: ABEGINO 6F .BOGAINE +63 127
#note Best - only bingo. weird since usually the 7-tile bingo (BEGONIA) is often easier to play. 
>Ted: AA 8K AA +8 58
>James: HHIMNTZ 5J HM +27 154
#note Quackle favores THIN 5J or NIZAM E1. The latter is because it scores far more points than anything else (44) but the former is very interesting to consider, because I am setting up a Z-play if I draw the right tiles without making it look obvious. For what it's worth, I like THIN or HIM 5K for that reason. To me, NIZAM is a little too volatile at this point, because there is usually a good chance I can use the Z in the future for my benefit and because of the open N. (as with either play, it would look like the most feasible way for Ted to claw back into the game is with a 3-3). 
>Ted: EJT M3 JET. +22 80
>James: ?HINTTZ 4L T.TH +22 176
#note Tricky rack now - I played TETH because INZ? is a strong rack and by far one of the best to go for bingos with. That being said, playing NTH F12 would leave ITZ? (comparatively strong) and leave Ted without a potential 3-3 lane. NAH E3 is one of the best scorers and is defensive, and is probably a better choice if one thinks his/her opponent has stronger word knowledge, as it is the best to give a shot of outrunning bingos.

>James: ?DEINUZ 12G UNsEIZ.D +86 262
#note Best - only bingo. 
>Ted: CIN O1 INC. +27 176
>James: BCGORWY 14J BRO.Y +32 294
#note Between GOBY C11 and this, it's pretty much a tossup. I was looking to score, perhaps kill the S (though it creates easy enough bingo lanes), and perhaps get a challenge. At this point, leave isn't that important for me because my goal is to merely preserve a lead and win the game. 
>Ted: EFIW 15G WIFE +34 210
>James: CGRTUWX C5 TUX +35 329
#note TUX is best because it scores 35 and doesn't create new lanes. Even though the leave isn't good again, it is starting to matter less - if I can match Ted's pace for another 3-4 turns, I will have almost limited his ability to catch up 100%. 
>Ted: IQ N1 QI +37 247
>James: ACGLORW C11 WOG +24 353
#note Either ALGOR C9 (which I missed) or WOG is about the best play. Both help to block up the only reasonable bingo lane left (unless 11s starting with INCH are seeable) and score well. ALGOR is probably slightly better because it plays more tiles, running the bag out faster. 
>Ted: EELNOOR -EELN +0 247
>James: ACEGLRV H1 VELCR. +42 395
#note It's almost impossible to lose at this point. To have a chance at winning, Ted would need to bingo twice in his next turns after this, which would mean I'd have to have nothing that could play along his first bingo to block him. If the game was closer, perhaps playing GUV G11 (leaving a good leave to work from) would be better as it would put the pressure on him to make an unblockable opening. 
>Ted: N 6B N. +4 251
>James: ?AAGOOS 13L O.A +22 417
#note Ted had the right idea but he didn't draw the right tiles. I can leave that opening and now fish for a final bingo. 
>Ted: F H8 ..F +7 258
>James: ?AEGOOS 2G O. +2 419
#note To block up his bingo chances while leaving my target spot open. 
>Ted: IL 9B IL. +4 262
