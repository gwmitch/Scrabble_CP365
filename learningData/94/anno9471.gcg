#note Played this 'cause I coulda sworn it didn't take an S.

#note I was wrong.

#note Not gonna play EPHOD, so this is fine.  Held and released.
>Pete_Zeigler: AINORST D8 .AROTINS +72 228
>Ryan_Fischer: DDGOORR 15A ROD. +15 190
#note It's not looking good.  Figured I'd set up a lane, balance, and hope for the best.  Settled on RODS instead of DORS 'cause I figured it'd be just a smidge easier to bingo to an R.
>Pete_Zeigler: EGO 14B GO.E +19 247
#note So much for that.  Now -AR.  Meh.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGLMOR 5H MAR.GOLD +62 252
#note Que sopresa!  What luck!
>Pete_Zeigler: ??EEIIS O1 wEIr.IES +113 360
#note Baaaaaaahahahaa.  But to Pete's credit, this is the ONLY 3x3.  Very nice!
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEFQW D2 QA.. +14 266
#note And so now I've gotta stare at this junk.  I held for a good long while, pretty sure it's good, but feeling so hopeless.  I missed a cool hotspot in F12 WEF(T) 35.  Just figured I'd dump the Q and see if I can clean this mess up somehow.  Not the best way to go by far.
>Pete_Zeigler: ENNTW M1 NEWT.N +18 378
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEFUW C9 FEW +29 295
#note Still WEFT.  FEW is close.  Keeps the U to play through the Q, and might even draw a bingo.
>Pete_Zeigler: AFOV 2J FOV.A. +40 418
#note Nice!  (Sigh.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEMRUY H1 CRUM.Y +54 349
#note Champ says 6B AY 20 is 9% to win.  I can see that.  But what two tiles?  Don't care enough to figure that one out, because there's no way the triple is staying, and more likely, he'll just hit it hard with either the X or the Z.  CRUM(M)Y surrenders, but with a bit of style.
>Pete_Zeigler: EEILPTX G2 EX +36 454
#note 6B ET 14 sets up PIXEL to go out.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEIZ 13G ZA +25 374
#note AE E10 sets up IZA(R) to go out.
>Pete_Zeigler: EILPT 13C P. +20 474
>Ryan_Fischer: AEI E10 AE +19 393
#note Low on time, didn't see 10B A(ER)IE 9 to go out.
