>Brian_Galebach: EILORTU 5I OUTLIER +67 75
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AABDIO O3 AB.OAD +36 56
#note No bingos.
>Brian_Galebach: JNO M3 JO.N +22 97
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIILMR N8 AIRMaIL +73 129
#note Best.  Also: SIMILAR, MILIARY, CRIMINAL, RAMILIE, IMPERIAL.
>Brian_Galebach: ER M3 ....ER +18 115
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGOWXY O14 OX +29 158
#note I was really concerned here with his fish which is why I played OX.  It's a bit too paranoid, I think, and though I saw OXEYE and OXYGEN, I really should've played one.  OXEYE, Champ says, is 63% 2-plies, even assuming an opponent's S.
>Brian_Galebach: Q 13M Q. +22 137
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEEGWY E4 WA.EY +22 180
#note G(L)EY or WEE(N)Y before this.
>Brian_Galebach: ADEENRT K4 A.TENDER +68 205
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEGLOY J9 EYE +32 212
#note Shoulda taken the Y spot with ELEGY as I first thought, but I didn't think leaving it alone with him drawing a random 7 would hurt so much.  Wrong.
>Brian_Galebach: GINZ 8A ZING. +60 265
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGLOTTV D1 VETO +32 244
>Brian_Galebach: EFM C2 FEM +33 298
>Ryan_Fischer: FGLPSTU 4G FUG +13 257
#note B5 UPL(I)FT 19 looks appealing.  I really was hurting for a bingo, though.  I thought FUG, with a couple vowels, would give me that.
>Brian_Galebach: CINO 12G COIN +14 312
#note He's become defensive.  It's now or never.
>Ryan_Fischer: KLPSTUW G10 PU.K +17 274
#note Okay, so it's never.  KLUT(Z), I didn't see.  P(O)ULT I did, but didn't see myself bingoing with KSW and lanes dwindling.  Champ says KLUTZ and POULT are about 11%, PUCK at 8%.  Hated doing PUCK given I didn't have an A, but my options were limited and I was low on time.
>Brian_Galebach: BCE 13D BEC. +12 324
#note Looks like I got him worried.
>Ryan_Fischer: HLNRSTW I10 WH.RL +27 301
#note For the want of a vowel.  Kamikaze time.  Though with THREE eses and the blank unseen this is probably suicidal.  He told me, though, that at the time of COIN and BECK, HE didn't have the eses which is why he was so worried.
>Brian_Galebach: ?AEEGST 15G GEStATE +86 410
#note 15G rESTAGE 89.  Oh well.
>Ryan_Fischer: ANORSTV 3B V.. +6 307
#note Champ says it's hopeless; play VAN for 22 at 12C.
>Brian_Galebach: IIST 1D .ISIT +24 434
>Ryan_Fischer: AHNORST 12A HORA +30 337
#note TORAH for 31.
>Brian_Galebach: AIS 14B AIS +11 445
#note Hook FEM for 12.
>Brian_Galebach:  (TSN) +6 451
