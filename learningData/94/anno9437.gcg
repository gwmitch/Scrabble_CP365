#note I really wanted to challenge, but I couldn't get some story out of my head where COEQUAL came up as a verb. Even Kenji thought it was good (though Noah knew it was phony - pays to know the 9s!)

#note M7 or O1? Quackle confirms my suspicion of M7 being better, yet somehow I couldn't get myself to play it.

#note ZIN? I think I undervalue 3V2C leaves like AEIRT. Theres only 2 As left, and two Is is still not very good, even without an I! I think I need to reevaulate how I make decisions like this one in the future.

#note I still want to keep the Y open, but maybe I can catch him without a bingo?
>JD: AAIILMN B1 MIL.A +18 402
#note Quackles pick is AMAIN. I'd be inclined to try and neutralize the D somewhat. Maybe the idea is that Jesse's lead is small enough, especially with ?? still out, that I will still win enough times with a smaller bingo (or maybe even without a bingo?) This is again a tough rack.
