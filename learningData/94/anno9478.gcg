#note Lots of options here. I looked at this, REGMATA, MEGARA, GAMAY, MAYA, RAGA, and AGAR. Prefered this to REGMATA because it was too rash. Preferred this to MAYA because I liked the leave a little better. Seemed like this was better than RAGA and AGAR because of points. MEGARA, GRAMA and GAMAY was tough. I wasn't sure how to choose between them. My board dynamics aren't very good, which makes it hard to know what to do. I think GAMAY might be best, though, because it provides a fairly open board, with some access to all quadrants. I was curious what Quackle's details chart would say on this play, but unfortunately it has somehow formatted weirdly, so I can only see a few details. Any idea how to fix this, smart people?

#note Seemed about right, though YE is another good choice that is more conducive to bingos. I thought BETU woud be a better leave, but ABETU might actually be. I liked YE.

#note Yikes. This is a tough rack, and this seemed like the best of a bad lot.

#note An interesting position. First of all, I am not a huge fan of (E)H, EH, or HE, as those keeps leaves with the V, which seems an especially bad tile on this board. This seemed like a good choice, but I think there's an even better one. Playing this at M7 is interesting, because it sets up a great scoring spot with (HOVEL)E(D), some decent scoring tiles, and an E. It's hard to say here. This is probably better though, because he has a great chance of having the E.

#note Some good options here, including JUDO, OOZE, and OUTDRANK. Even tho OUTDRANK gives back the most, I like it because it really helps cement Mike's position.
>whatnoloan: BEENOSW 12K .WE +25 352
#note A few options here. I can play this, go with the straightforward play of WEB 7M, or play OWE up there. I like OWE better than WEB because it gives back decent scores with the B and not much for him. I like this because it blocks a decent scoring spot for him but still keeps some okay place for my B. One major drawback to this is giving away easy Z spots. The thing is, there are still a few after such plays as OWE, and WEB, and it might be more prudent to block this spot. Tough to say, but I think this is a good option.

#note Very tough rack. The preendgame isn't looking good. I need to score here, but I also want to try to give away few scoring spots, which appears extremeley hard. This seemed to give me decent hopes of going out somewhere, but he can just block by playing on the O column, as I saw. I played this because I was low on time, and it was the best I could think of. What would you do here? Mike still had about 9 minutes left...
More analysis: What makes this pre-endgame so tough is the lack of good available spots, making an out-in-one nearly impossible for me this turn. James Leong comes up with a potentially good solution for this. It is to play NO(I)LS O6. This scores okay, putting me up a bit, and threatens some good plays, namely BI(N), BE(N) and BI. Unlike most row 6 lanes, it doesn't give Mike much to play with at all, weakening his chances of an out-in-two, while making my chances of this (plus a score!) quite good. Seems like a nice play. 
Finally, after much analysis, me and Zamez came up with the best play. Zamez found (I)NSOLE, and we determined that it loses with the F, but probably wins with every other tile. Good work, and case closed!

#note This is a nice find, but not a winning play. The best thing to do is SiGNE(D) O10. I have to play P(A)L, blocking his out play (the normal high-scoring play of SL(I)P gives him F(A)T), and he gets F(E) for huge, which barely overcomes my outplay of (A)IS 14E. We also found Fa(N)N(I)ES in the postmortem, but that is not good, because P(A)L just blocks and gives me (A)IS, except this time he has no way to overcome the high score.
