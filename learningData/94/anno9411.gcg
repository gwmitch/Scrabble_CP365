>James: ?ALLOPR 8D PALLORs +72 72
#note There's also POLLARD and PAYROLL, but I chose to play PALLORs so it couldn't be capitalized. 
>Gabriel: ADKNOPU 9C FAX +30 30
>James: ?BGIOTW I7 B.OW +13 85
#note I'm really not sure why I didn't play BLOW. As it was, I picked one to keep what I thought was the best bingo rack. However, Quackle says that WAX E7 is good, which is also true because the chances of drawing a bingo rack is fairly high. Same with a whole host of other plays that keep the B. 
>Gabriel: DKNOPUW D8 ..VAN +20 50
>James: ?GIIORT 11A RIG.TOnI +66 151
#note Missing IGnITOR 11G and IGNITROn/IGNITORs 12B - all better because they don't set up a 3-3.... 
>Gabriel: EHIOSTT 12F HOTTIES +81 131
#note Which Gabe had (THORITES). An important lesson - if you find a bingo, KEEP LOOKING for a bit to see if you can find something better if the one you found isn't really satisfying. 
>James: AEEIIRY A7 EYRI. +24 175
#note AIRIER A6 is favored slightly by Quackle over EYRIR. The leave is stronger (EY opposed to AEI) but I was worried about easy plays from B2-B6. This might be the best time to play AIRIER, simply because Gabe hasn't had the chance to refine his newly-drawn tiles. 
>Gabriel: NORZ K9 ZON.R +28 159
>James: ABEEGIM 13C BEAM +35 210
#note Best play - it scores the best and leaves an okay leave. GIBE 13A is not bad as well because it scores respectably (25) and leaves AEM (a stronger leave). 
>Gabriel: ACDEIIU J4 NUDE. +13 172
>James: EEGIOSV 14B VISE +32 242
#note Played to grab as big a lead as possible. Thinking about it, VENGE 4H looks slightly better. At 26, it is 6 less points but it also saves an S. 
>Gabriel: ARW L8 RAW +23 195
>James: AAEEGOT K2 GOATEE +28 270
#note Best play. 
>Gabriel: UU 4I U..U +8 203
>James: ADEIJNS 2F JADIN. +33 303
#note I played this to block up the G as a bingo lane (playing just two Us signified to me that Gabe had a good remaining 5 tiles to not exchange just UU or UU + some other bad tile in his hand) and to score well. I also assumed that if Gab would bingo, it would likely be at B1, leaving me with a good response play parallel to JADING to extend my lead once more. Perhaps a wiser defensive play is JIN 3G, especially because it leaves me with ADES, which is a good set to try and bingo with. 
>Gabriel: FGIINOS 1G MOKE +51 254
>James: CCEIIOS F5 COI. +8 311
#note This was a tough rack, mostly because I didn't see SECCO or CISCO B3, which would block up most of the top left from bingos. Because I couldn't see anything that I was satisfied with blocking, I decided to go for another bingo. To that end, maybe RICE 8L is better, as it scores 10 more and opens up more lanes for me, but I know Gabe is just as good with the words as I am. As such, I'd say CISCO is the best play at this point for me. 
>Gabriel: EGY M9 GEY +30 284
>James: CEEIIST 5E I.E +10 321
#note At this point, I thought it was too close to play anything particularly defensive and instead to save up my tiles for a bingo. CEIST is a strong leave, but perhaps playing RICE 13K (leaving EIST) is just as strong. 
>Gabriel: DF B10 F.D +28 312
>James: ACEISST B1 ASCITES +74 395
#note I played this over ECTASIS B1 for one reason: if I draw the Q, I want at least two possibilities of playing the Q. This had 3 - QI 4A, E4 and a chance at QAT 1A. 
>Gabriel: EHLPQTU 4A P.TH +24 336
>James: ADLNNR G1 ..NN.R +11 406
#note D3 AH to block SUQ. However, at this point I really didn't care and just wanted to finish the game.
