#note Champ says (T)ANKFUL, followed by FAUX for 46.  I got blinded by the hotspot I thought I just HAD to use.  KUNA is weak 'cause if I don't draw a vowel I'm sunk.  Shoulda played FAX at the very least.

#note I don't quite see how ONO(S) is supposed to help me come back from anything...  Even though the leave is horrendous, TRAN(Q) gives me ever so slight an edge to come back.  It's just essential to open that quadrant now and hope for the best.
