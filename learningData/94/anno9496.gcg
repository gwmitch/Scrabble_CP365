>Jackson: ?ACDENU --  -76 22
>Geoff: DILOTVV 9F DOT +17 37
#note Knowing my opponents rack and the good chance he might see something through the R next turn or with the JUGA hook, I opted to play DOT 9F, in the hopes he'll miss something like DUrANCE K1. Although I didn't notice VOLT, this reasoning eventually pays off.
>Jackson: ?ACDENU 7J .U +4 26
>Geoff: DEILNVV L3 LIVED +24 61
#note Could have seriously used an open O here.

>Jackson: AIQ N2 QAI. +28 130
>Geoff: HIMNOSZ O1 ZINS +58 148
#note I initially thought of MIZEN and erroneously HIZEN#, but as much as fishing for potential bingos by keeping the S, I couldn't refuse the points.
>Jackson: EFOOTUW 10F OWE +29 159

>Jackson: AENORSS M7 SENORAS +76 235
>Geoff: AHNOOPX L12 HOAX +56 230
#note Didn't even notice OX or anything here, focused on the two obvious spots for HOAX.
>Jackson: EEGRTT N12 GET +18 253
#note He put down TE(X)TER# for perhaps 5 seconds and then removed it, probably by recognising it looked too new to be TWL. I assume he missed E(X)ERT for 36, which in retrospect was much better than his play of GET.
>Geoff: LNOPRST 5B PLOT +20 250
>Jackson: AERT 15H RETA. +36 289
>Geoff: AINRRSW 3G WARN +25 275
#note Perhaps I completely overlooked the O on SENORAS this game, but my intention at this point was to keep as many bingo lanes open as possible, and none seemed better than HAG.
>Jackson: CHI B2 CHI. +22 311

>Geoff: EEIPRSY H1 PY. +24 309
>Jackson: ?IKNNRT 13B TR.NKINg +74 404
#note At this point he plays TR(U)NKINg, and the somewhat low score, considering the k could have packed more of a punch, caught me by surprise. I was wary of the word in itself, and held for obvious reasons, but I was holding OREIDES on my rack, and knowing my opponent just emptied the bag, based on the 86 points I get from OREIDES and the 26 from my opponents final rack, I knew I had an easy win, so I had no need to challenge.
