>Steve_Bush: EELTX 8H TELEX +40 40
>Ryan_Fischer: EEHIKLS K5 LEK. +16 16
#note Big miss.  Way to start out!  HE 7K 19 or HELIX for 30.  HIKE was the static top choice.  All of 'em sim with low 40% win pct.  LEK(E) doesn't register.
>Steve_Bush: FGINO 9E GONIF +25 65
#note Oops, he missed TELEXING.  This doesn't bode well for the game.  Looks like a closed board coming...
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEHIOS 10E OH +29 45
#note 5H CHE(L)OIDS 64.  I figured I was missing something.  OH's pretty icky but I thought it was my best bet.

>Ryan_Fischer: CEEIIUY 9L ICY +20 137
#note I figured I couldn't afford to not score another turn.  Q likes C12 (L)EI 18 or 13D EYE 21.  Saw the latter, but the leave was horrid.  Mine's not much better.  I was banking on luck.

#note O1 BAT(T)UE 24 gives me a 6.98% win pct.  Hehe.  Oh, what could I possibly be up to?

#note Well, not THAT.

>Steve_Bush: AAEGLOR 2F GOAL +21 384
#note You really hate to be in Steve's position here.  It's all I've done to luckbox into an undeserving win.  I mean, yes, I planned this to happen with A(C)E, but for it to fall into place like that even WITH him bingoing was so incredibly fortunate.  Champ fin 2E AGLARE, winning 97%.  All other plays don't score enough or block enough.  In practice, AGLARE only wins about 75% of the time.  GOAL, ~30%.
