#note I was all like "Please exchange!  Please exchange!"

#note Oops: 5E F(E)TCHER 60.  Thought this was soooo clever.  Even WEFT/FEVER Static likes better.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAFNRRT E3 ARF +22 160
#note ARF/FEVER for one more.
>Pete_Zeigler: AA 9C AA +14 96
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDMNRT 12C TAND.M +24 184
#note I lost an S here to an overdraw.  I thought of BARMEN but why not BADM(E)N.  Champ likes that best.  Or BATMEN or BEDAMN.  TANDEM is just fine too, apparently.  ARMBAN, TABARD, MBIRA, BADMAN, and BIRDMAN are of note.

>Ryan_Fischer: ABKORYY 3C BR.KY +36 220
#note D1 KAYO 41 is best.  Shoulda known this was too vowel heavy.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIRSU 15A IRES +36 302
#note Well, he's back in it.  Two blanks unseen, two eses, too.  I can't stop scoring.  Champ likes AURIS at O6 or K4 before this.
>Pete_Zeigler: ??GNOPT O8 POsTiNG +87 313
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDDIOU D1 BO.A +22 324
#note I13 BIO 24 is Champ's choice.  5I ABOU(N)D.  All these look so ugly.  I just decided to score and hope for the best.  Wish I coulda figured out how to lose a D and be happy with the play.  BOUDI(N) is an option.
>Pete_Zeigler: INSTT 15K TINTS +45 358
#note Held and released once I remembered the anagram pair.
>Ryan_Fischer: CDDIIJU 13L DJI. +24 348
#note Gotta hope for the Q here to win, I think.
>Pete_Zeigler: AIRV 1D .RAVI +30 388
>Ryan_Fischer: CDIMQSU K4 QUIDS +47 395
#note Finally an S!  Yeah, Pete was low on time here.  QUIDS loses to perfect play.  Q(U)ID is 50/50, whatever that means -- er, I followed the path and that means perfect play yields a tie.  When you sim it, though, MIC(S), Q(U)ID, QUIDS, SC(R)IM, and SC(U)D all win.  Odd.  It's not right either, as some of those plays C-stick me.
