#note this looks rotten, didn't even show up in the top list, but doesn't sim too badly. don't really know what reasoning to use other than "i don't want him to take an easy scoring spot" (-2) J4 WORM

#note i picked the best bingo, but quackle doesn't like bingoing here; instead play 1A DAH. totally makes sense.. but just a little. (-2.5)

#note nice... gigot was obvious before that, seemingly, but i can't take a chance. quackle is actually liking GRIG best, why? yeah. (-1.5)

#note with just under a couple minutes on my clock i had to make sure he couldn't bingo. well i had more than that and then had to retrack. i had to retrack at least 5 times at natl's....  i need a better tracking method. quackle likes 13H GRITTED by a lot more, because i'll go out next turn. i didn't have enough time to figure out whether he could bingo through the T or not, even though it's not too hard to figure it out.
