>D_Wiegand: FLLNNPY 8F FLY +18 18
#note Interestingly, 8G is regarded more highly (1.8)
>Verbie: ?AEGHRY F8 .RY +17 17
#note Missing LEtHARGY G8 (-18).  Had the opener been at 8G this would have been a more critical miss.
>D_Wiegand: DDLLNNP -DLNNP +0 18
#note Yes, even he draws like that sometimes.  I'd keep DN (and Quackle agrees, by 1)
>Verbie: ?AEGHIM E10 MIG +19 36
#note Missing 7H MEGAHIt (-21)
>D_Wiegand: DILNTUW H4 WIND. +16 34
#note 12B TWIG is also worth a look.
>Verbie: ??AEEHU 6G U.HEAtEd +61 97
#note Better bingos here- AtHENEUm or UrEtHANE thru the same N put the H on the TLS.  Nothing through the G.  (-8)
>D_Wiegand: LQSSTUX 13E SUQ +29 63
#note No need to panic about the Q- LAX K5 20 beats this by 2, but the real star is SQUAT K3 28 to drop another consonant. (-3)
>Verbie: DEENRRU L4 RE.URNED +68 165
#note I call a blank a T and the next rack needs a T.  Only other bingo is DURNEDER on line N.
>D_Wiegand: GLORSTX 7K L.X +37 100
>Verbie: ABDEORT K9 ABORTED +82 247
#note This is getting ridiculous.  Almost missed that this fit.
>D_Wiegand: GINORST 12A GOIN. +18 118
#note Quackle does not understand board conditioning the way Wiegand does.  I would have taken the points from the same leave with DOING 15K.  The duck thinks GOR J9 21 to be top (by 7 over the actual and by 1 over my idea.)
>Verbie: CEIOOPS 15F COOPE. +33 280
>D_Wiegand: AORSTVZ C11 V.ZOR +34 152
#note Nice block, given what I had lined up through there.
>Verbie: AIMPSST 15A TA.P +27 307
#note I'm concerned about the nine-timer lane, but better options are around that split the Ss, topping out at PES 5K 30 (-9.5).  If the scores were reversed I'd play PETSAI 14J 38.
>D_Wiegand: AENNSTW 14J W.ANS +45 197
#note The wonder-leave from WEN is actually worth the point sacrifice (by 1.5).  
>Verbie: BIIIMSS H10 IBIS +20 327
#note Best of a bad lot.
>D_Wiegand: AEENNTT K1 TETAN.. +20 217
#note Throw open more lanes rather than M10 TENANT or A7 TENTAGE to cash points.  Dave needs to put the board in motion.
>Verbie: EHIIMOS 1E HOMIES. +36 363
#note (-6) to HIE J2.  I'm converting two lanes to one hard one, but HIE makes that one lane the sort of thing only Wiegand can hit (a 9 through the HE).
>D_Wiegand: AEEILNV 5K ..VE +21 238
#note There's fishing plays like this, and cashing plays.  Q prefers the cashers like ALEVIN M9 or VALINE 2B.  But those are concession moves.
>Verbie: AGIIJTU 2B JUGA +29 392
#note Nothing else is close.
>D_Wiegand: AAEEILN A6 ALIENA.E +77 315
#note Finally a shoe drops.
>Verbie: DIILOOT N1 LOID.. +12 404
#note Should have seen HALOID with the same tiles (-8)
