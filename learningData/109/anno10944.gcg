>Brett: AEINNTW 8G VUG +14 14
#note Started off with a pretty nasty rack; I think I had vugg so I put down vug to set up my next move.

>Peggy: EHLLQVY H7 B.Y +8 8
#note She starts off tight...
>Brett: AEINNTW J8 GAP +21 35
#note I catch the other y, and make my play to set up vuggy.
>Peggy: EHLLOQV K9 LID +14 22
#note There goes that plan!
>Brett: EINNNTW 10J ..NEY +18 53
#note Decided to give a little with this move to try to get into the bag some.
>Peggy: EHILOQV M9 H.RON +24 46
>Brett: IIINNTW L12 MEND +28 81
>Peggy: AEIORSS 14F ERASIO.S +71 117
>Brett: ?RX 15F ReX +57 138
>Peggy: AAEFHIT H12 FL.. +18 135
>Brett: CENRRTU G5 BRA.O +23 161
>Peggy: AAEEHIT H2 DITA +10 145
#note After my last move my tiles were looking week...I had unite for H1 if she hadn't played dita.
>Brett: CENRSTU F5 AE +13 174
>Peggy: AEEEHPU 1G VEG +39 184
#note I had never seen edita* but I didn't even pause to challenge.  She put it down pretty confidently.  It could have been worse.  
>Brett: CCNRSTU -? +0 174
#note I think I drew a blank and then decided to ditch the 2 u's I had to set up a bingo.  
>Peggy: AEEHKPU 2H .OC +15 199
>Brett: CNNRSTU 4B QANAT +31 205
#note Ugh!  As soon as I toss the u's I get the Q!  Figures.  Luckily I had a non-q word.  I thought I could hit the double letter on 4A but that was wishful thinking.  
>Peggy: AEEHKPU C2 WR.CK +28 227
>Brett: ?EOOPST E6 POOrEST +71 276
#note Was happy to find a spot for this!  Still have trouble thinking iSOTOPE.  Really wish I saw POThO(L)ES at 13C.  
>Peggy: AEEHINU D10 FAIL +25 252
>Brett: EIJRTUW 4H .UI +3 279
#note I draw a J but can't play JEFE without another e.  I play TUI to kill a the last bingo lane.  Not sure if this is a good idea since tight endgame is usually not my strong point.  
>Peggy: DEEHINU 2B T.INE +20 272
>Brett: EEIJRTW 10B JE.. +30 309
#note Got lucky getting an e from drawing only 2 tiles... Had the greatest chance of getting an e from what was in the bag though.  
>Peggy: ADEHOOU B10 .OINS +24 296
#note She said she had to put this down.  It was the play...I had nothing to get to the triple word.  Felt I had to put something there though because it's highly volatile.  Tui was probably my favorite word for this game.  
>Brett: EIMRTTW A12 TUI +11 320
>Peggy: ADEHIOU 1A OE +8 304
>Brett: EHIMRTZ 3J HERTZ +42 362
#note I started to panic a bit because I didn't see a really great z play until I found hertz!  She complimented my play and thought that was really nice of her.  It finally gave me some seperation.  
>Peggy: ADEELUW N6 WALE.ED +35 339
#note Walleyed is good; this is not.  I still need to work on sniffing out some of these phonies.  I almost thought this was a bingo.  I ask her what she score was to confirm.  I didn't challenge and made my play to go out.  
>Brett: IM 5A MI. +18 380
#note Fun game.  I didn't realize how well I drew from the bag.  Peggy is a strong player.  
>Brett:  (U) +2 382
