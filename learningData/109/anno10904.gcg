#note Quackle likes the reckless 84-point bingos better than the sane 80-point ones... Quackle and I are ridiculous like that...

#note It would be nice to draw NIFTILY or NITINOL or something... fat chance. Sim says to get rid of the L and score a little extra with LOUIE D1.

#note Or INLY G7, which scores a bit more and doesn't shut down the bingo line. But honestly, how can I expect to bingo through that V anyway? I'll take the better leave.

#note Sims best by far. Looks like another one of those situations where the board isn't bingo-friendly, so I gotta try outrunning.

#note Couldn't think of a good way to open things up, so I figured I'd procrastinate on that. Maybe RUB 3K would work? Certainly worth considering. There's also JURAT D8 just for the points... I missed that one.

#note Trying to set up VAUNTIE and draw another E... but there's a much better way! NU 6K. That way I can draw the D for DEVIANT, the E for NAIVETE or the U for VAUNTIE. That's a 6/11 shot... although of course she can block.

#note Oh. Well then, I guess it didn't matter which setup I made.
