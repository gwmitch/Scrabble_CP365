#note This tops the sim by about a point over I6 (E)F. I hate just dropping one tile. 
>Scott_Appel: EEEP J7 EPEE +15 65
>Stefan_Rau: AGLOOSU D4 ...GOU +10 76
#note Oh, wow, this actually is best by a healthy margin. It seemed like such a cop-out of a  move at the time.

>Stefan_Rau: AILNORS 10G ALI.NORS +60 136
#note Not that I'm one to complain about a bingo, but it seemed like there were an unusual number of 60- and 61-pointers this tournament. This (or AILERONS) is the only one here.

>Stefan_Rau: EIIJKRS A7 KI. +30 250
#note Yeah, my brain kinda checked out here. I rejected (P)IKERS because I didn't want a huge-scoring bingo coming down the O column, but I can't remember what lame reasons I came up with for not going with KOJI or JOKIER. KIF is just silly.

>Stefan_Rau: EGIJRST 3J JI.TER +37 287
#note I'm just butchering this game. I wasn't crazy about JITTER at the time (Hey, why don't I just go ahead and double his chances of a triple-triple?), and it gets absolutely slaughtered in the sim. Playing for leave with J(O)G or blocking the lanes with J(I)GS look much stronger. 
>Scott_Appel: ?ADMNNU 1H UNDe.MAN +140 315
#note Clearly, if you want to see a triple-triple, the place to be is at a game between Scott and me.....this is the third one that's hit the board in our 11 meetings. Unfortunately, it's UNDERMAN# (also MUNDANER#....c'mon, what the frigging hell, OWL?). UNDERMANNED is perfectly good, regardless of lexical preference. I guess no one would believe me if I tried to claim that letting this go was the result of confusion from studying my elevens?
