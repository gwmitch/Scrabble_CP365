>Jim_Burlant: EEFNRUV 8D FEVER +30 30
#note Loath to give up both E's, but the FR leave (compared to NU) didn't seem like it was worth the 6 scoreboard points.  It takes a few hundred iterations in the sim before it eventually sorts out, but this is best.  VENUE wins roughly 1/2% less often.  FUN 8G and 8F ENUF are also worth consideration.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DMNOOOT 7G MONODOT +74 74
#note If/when Sam plays phonies, he usually dickers over them; he doesn't slap them down with confidence the way he did when he put this down.  I wasn't sure about this, and I realized after the fact that the legitimate word is MONOCOT.  Anyway - given my rack, I chickened out, as I didn't want to chance losing a place to play my bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNORU 9G NEUROMA +71 101
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CHT E8 .TCH +18 92
>Jim_Burlant: DDIIQTT 7C QI +26 127
#note I didn't like the leave with this, and Q doesn't either.  Q says I should play 6J DIT, which I considered.  I figured I'd just take the points and clean this crap out on the next turn.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AGGI 6H GIGA +27 119
>Jim_Burlant: ADDINTT 5I TAD +25 152
#note Best - 58% to win.  Not much else worth consideration.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: OOX D11 OXO +25 144
>Jim_Burlant: BDIKNOT C11 NOB +33 185
#note Bad, bad, bad.   Can someone please explain how I couldn't think of KNOB?!?  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AILV B12 VAIL +32 176
>Jim_Burlant: ?DIKOST N1 DaKOITS +87 272
#note If nothing else, this tells me that Sam genuinely believed MONODOT was good; he groaned as this came down.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HIIL 10K HILI +20 196
>Jim_Burlant: AEGILNT 2H AGENTI.L +60 332
#note About the only thing I got right here was that there was nothing that played on row 15.  This is bad again - GNATLIKE!  Despite my blundering, still 98% to win in a short sim.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: JW H1 J.W +39 235
>Jim_Burlant: CEEIRSY L2 .YE +12 344
#note Weak.  If I was going to play so cheaply, I  should have played LEY 15B.  Best is 15A CLERISY, which I didn't know.  This is pathetic.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: FIP 15A F.IP +36 271
>Jim_Burlant: CEIRSUY 4C CURIES +33 377
#note Getting UY was not exactly what I had in mind when I dumped off EY.  I did this to score 33 and turn 6 to go after one of the remaining SSZ?. Q agrees - this is best.  97.5% to win in a short sim, nothing else within 5 pionts.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?DEELNS O8 ENSiLED +82 353
#note I am STEE and STEE is me - HILI does not take the back S.  Shame on me for letting this go!!!! ENSILED doesn't play anywhere, but ENISLED does play at 11H for 87.   Even with this gift, Sam is only 14% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: AABERRY 14J BRAYE. +36 413
#note Or BAYARD.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AW 13M AW. +27 380
>Jim_Burlant: AEERRTZ 15G ZETA +43 456
#note Best is 15L RET, guaranteeing an out with either ZAIRE F2 or RAZE 15G.  This  - bleah.
