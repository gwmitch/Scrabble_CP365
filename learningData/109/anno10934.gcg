>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?AEEHSV 8C sHEAVES +82 82
#note Any number of bingos in this rack.  Other options include HEAVENS, HEAVIES, HEAVERS, RESHAVE, BEHAVES.  Little did I know this game was already over.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEILO D8 .EILED +20 20
#note Q doesn't like this at all, preferring that I instead dump off OE for 10 at 7C or 9C.  Given my next draw, this wouldn't have mattered.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BIZ E5 BIZ. +30 112
>Jim_Burlant: EEFIOOP F3 POOF +34 54
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: DKNRU C3 DRUNK. +30 142
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIMNO C11 EME +22 76
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  I hated this play because of what it did to the board. If I'd looked a little harder, I'd have seen that this would have played for 29 at D4.  Again, the only consolation I can take is that it would have been a handful of points of spread in a lost cause.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EGLT B11 GELT +23 165
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINOO G7 A.ION +10 86
#note The options all suck.  When I evaluated this position, I gave serious consideration to exchanging.  I thought that if I didn't create a potential opening to H15, Sam would shut everything down and the game would already be over.  If I exchanged he'd play for 25, or if I put this down I'd play for 10 and give back 35.  And yes, I was crossing my fingers he didn't have the J.  Best according to the duck is to exchange 6, keeping the E.  Exchange 6 wins 9%; this wins not quite 7.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AJW F10 JAW +56 221
#note I should have known better than to assume that he'd have missed the J with the bag 2/3 full.  <<Sigh>>
>Jim_Burlant: AEFINOY A13 FAY +37 123
#note At least I got one play right this game.  Up to 3.5% winning chances - woo hoo.  His next rack takes that to zero.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?ACRSTV 4F .VeRCAST +74 295
#note Believe it or not, Sam is "only" winning 99.5% with this choice.  What miracle can I conjure up to come back and win this game?
>Jim_Burlant: BEEEINO H10 BEE +21 144
#note Q says I need to trade the points for the more volatile board and play these tiles for 13 at B1.  Whatever, given my next rack it wouldn't have mattered.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IU M4 .UI +3 298
#note When this came down, I breathed a sigh of relief - Sam is known for this, where he'll just start playing for absolutely nothing and wonder what he's trying to accomplish.  While the game was pretty much over, I was still hoping that if I got a couple of breaks and maybe a late bingo, I could at least stem the bleeding while he dinked around for chump change.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINOO -IIOO +0 144
#note Enough of this crap already!!!!!   This was where I really came close to losing it - Sam had just played for THREE points and his lead still grew because I'd just drawn my 7th straight rack of garbage, and the +200 spread I'd worked for was on the verge of being completely wiped out.  As if it really matters, Q says the best play is to exchange 6 keeping the E, which wins 0.25%.  This wins 0.2% but sims with higher valuation.  Woo hoo.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ILL I4 .ILL. +6 304
>Jim_Burlant: AEHNRRU H1 RUN. +9 153
#note Not that it matters by this point, but I didn't consider plays that burned the E, considering that there were only 2 of them unseen.  I also wanted to unload the U.  Best is apparently H1 HARe.  3K HUE is tops statically, but it fares worse than this in the sim.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEIMNOR 13H ROMAINE +76 380
>Jim_Burlant: AEHINNP 4A PI.N +18 171
#note I'd made the decision that I wasn't going to burn my E for anything other than a spread-saving bingo - probably a big mistake.  20/20 hindsight makes me wonder if I should have just shut the board down and taken my lumps.

>Jim_Burlant: ACOTWXY O1 CA.Y +42 255
#note Not sure I had this rack right...not sure I had the O.  If I did, I missed COX or COXA 14L.  COX would have been a lot better than this, as it would have saved roughly 30 points of spread.
#note Annotation ends here, final score 556 - 255.  OUCH!!!!!
