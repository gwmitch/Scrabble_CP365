#note exchanging seems like an overreaction here. HILI or HIE are more acceptable, i think. I think keeping a Y for 12-14 pts didn't seem too appetizing. quackle puts exchanging at about 4.5 pts back.

#note missed behave for the better leave even though it is not as good defensively. (-2.5)

#note yeah, 6J ENVOI is a bit better. another miss. i don't know if i want to make that type of opening though. (-4)

>cesar: AEEIORT I7 O.E +8 227
#note N1 OE seems a bit silly but i guess it scores a bit more. or i could blow up the rack with 6J ARVO. i spent a long time on this move... i hate gambles. 8 pts for a 42% bingo percentage doesn't seem that worth it. 
>meyer: EGNOOSY 6C GOONEYS +67 298
#note i guess the other OE would have been worse for me
>cesar: ACEIRST F3 SCA.TIER +62 289
#note i dunno, should i play CANISTER?  quackle likes ERGASTIC again by a little bit. that would have been amusing. i didn't realize it scored one more. (-1)

#note gave him the bingo again, wouldn't have happened with ergastic :(
>cesar: ?ADFIMT 14A DIAT.M +30 319
#note i can't take quackle seriously with D10 FAT or FAT. i laid down FAD and just loudly muttered i can't do that and took it back like a crazy man. DIATOM seems the only thing that can give me a tiny chance to win this game...

#note didn't actually think of B11 FUJI... interesting play!! however i'm too far down for it to work. JUS is nice if i get the miracle bingo.
