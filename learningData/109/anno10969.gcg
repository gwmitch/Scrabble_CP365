#note Not bad but not the best. Quackles's top choices are (FA)VOR (which seems a little too gung-ho with two more S's out there) and 13C ARVO (which looks pretty solid to me).

#note Tough spot. Obviously I hate spending my only consonant and keeping four vowels, but if I don't play here, he probably will, and if he's got the Y it's going to be forty-plus. And as much as I'd like to drop one of those E's, EAT is suicidal. Quackle suggests ignoring the spot and balancing my rack with M11 A(L)EE or A(L)E.....that's a little too much entropy for my tastes.
