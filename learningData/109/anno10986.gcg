#note Made this play pretty quickly, maybe a little quicker than I should have. BOWL to set up the second to last S is a great option, and BOW looks pretty strong too with a vowel heavy bag. One of the benefits of ALOW is that it leaves an S hook that could stay open for a few turns, and gives me a T hook to the bottom triple. Still unsure which is best!

>Rafi_: DOSTTUV 6E TU.S +34 288
#note Wow. TOUTS sims considerably better than TUTS. I considered it because of the vowel heavy pool, but figured the O made the leave slightly more stable. With all the E's left I am likely going to have COVE or WOVE available for ways to score with the V next turn. The only benefit that I can see is that I bingo slightly more often with DTV vs. DOTV. Oh and one point... woohoo. Very surprised at the sim results, and not convinced that TOUTS is better.

#note Sweet play! Not liking my chances at this point.
>Rafi_: GIIORTV 8M .VO +18 330
#note I was debating here between AVO and VIGIL, but didn't consider ZIG, which looks best. VIGIL sucks because it gives back easy scoring plays. AVO is worrisome because of the 3 remaining I's but I do have some bingo chances with DIGERATI, IGNITRON, RIGATONI, IGNITORS, and maybe a couple more. COIR is also interesting - I didn't consider it because I was so hooked on unloading the V. Definitely a mistake.

>Rafi_: EGIIORT H12 .OIR +18 348
#note Didn't think of DIORITE, but after ZIN I'm pretty screwed if I play 6 tiles opening up a lane I would imagine. I put Chris on AEINR or AEINS or EINRS or AEERS or something, so the bag is something similar to AEEEFHIQUY (plus a couple) for me, which would be in bad shape after DIORITE. My thoughts with COIR were basically that I need to draw the H, N, or S, but he likely has the N, the S or both. I don't really know what to say about this play... any suggestions?
>Chris_Cree: AAEEFQU 10J E.E. +5 361
>Rafi_: AEGHINT 15A INGATHE. +89 437
#note In (almost) any other situation I would have challenged ERES off the board, but I would have hated to have lost the game and a chance at first because of a brain-fart on a 5 point play. I looked at the pool which was AEEFIIQRSUY - and didn't see any bingoes right off the bat (although SQUIREEN and DEIFIERS are possible with an EEIRS leave). I was just excited that I drew the bingo! In retrospect I should have held longer and noticed the possible out-bingoes and challenged to put my winning chances at 100%.
