>Mike_Wolfberg: KOW 8G WOK +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: ADOOPUU -OOPUU +0 0
#note Surprising that the sim prefers DOPA for 26, keeping the dreadful OUU. This sims second, about 3 points back.
>Mike_Wolfberg: AEMX 9G EXAM +37 57
>Evans_Clinchy: AADEFGI 10I FAG +25 25
#note For some reason I thought this would be better defensively than the 7F placement... since FAG is a bit harder to underlap than EXAM was. Sim says 7F is fine.

#note Well, there's my worst play of the year! Missed the S hook on QUIRT. Thus, no FLORINS. And thus, I lose.

>Evans_Clinchy: CEINORS B6 C..NS +32 324
#note On this board, I thought it made sense to give up on bingoing and try outrunning him. This does get me close. But Quackle suggests a couple of setuppy fishes that might work: OAR B6 and IN 7M are both interesting. I'm not sure what's right here.
>Mike_Wolfberg: DI N1 ID +14 347
>Evans_Clinchy: EEIORSV 7K EVE. +8 332
#note Quackle seems to like EVIL 5K, but that seems too easy to block. EVEN works open two lanes -- one for a seven hooking the S for SEVEN, and one for an eight through the V. Maybe he messes up and blocks the wrong lane.
>Mike_Wolfberg: ALP M1 PAL +19 366
#note Well, that is odd.
>Evans_Clinchy: BIOOORS 14M SOB +22 354
#note My only hope is getting a free turn, so I'll play this first and pray he challenges it. Assuming perfect endgame play, the best sequence is OORIE first and then this.
