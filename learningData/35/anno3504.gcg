#note this play was 9th best according to Quackle, but i hate all the leaves Quackle suggests here. combos i dont feel comfortable with at all.

#note the duck raises HAVOC for 46 from 8K

#note uh, yuck. i figured playing defense was a good idea here.

#note notice how many vowels we're dumping here? this might be a problem later on.
>xp: DEEIINT O1 INTI +18 98
#note Quackle HATES this move and says, "xp your an idiot," opting for ENDITE O1 for 33. OK, i can see that. but when you've drawn 87,000 I's, is it too much to ask for an I-free rack?

#note damnit, Ed's doing that thing where he plays all of his tiles. doesnt he get extra points for that or something.

#note well, the board is already well peppered with CHILI on it, so lets spice it up even more!

#note that play pretty much sums up that rack

#note BOX or COX? my thinking was play COX for defense, guard against that pesky Y.
>ed: DELOOTW 15G L.TEWOOD +63 292
#note OK, now here's where this game gets really interesting. What does Ed do here? does he bingo with a blank and S unseen? does he play WOOLED 2A for 37? tough call. given the circumstance, i think i would have played the bingo, just because the tilepool is godawful at this point Ð we have burned through almost all of the vowels and klunky counter imagineable is still unseen. so, without the bingo, he wont necessarily be able to catch me. nonetheless, it makes this game simply a question of who plunks down an S first on O15.
>xp: BEINNUZ 3I BUN. +13 280
#note of course, i was SURE he's got one or both of the ?S combo. my thought here was not to empty the bag. BENZIN for 46 at 2A is a good option as well. like i said, my thought was to not empty the bag, but i wasnt really thinking, because i figured that i was sunk.
>ed: ABDMMNY C8 MA.NDY +26 318
#note amazingly, Ed manages to avoid picking either the S or the blank, which happen to come out of the bag for me and leading to ...

#note ed's outrack of BJLMQVY just might be the worst outrack in the history of scrabble. so i get 200 for this outplay, and make it look like a rout. what a weird game.

#note if its a win over Ed, the game is bound to be strange.
