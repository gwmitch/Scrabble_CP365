#note COLOBI is slightly better.  Sometimes you just need to give up blocking the board.

#note Quackle likes ADOBE instead, but I don't think I agree.  There's a bigger problem than duplication here.  We're basically racing to the blank and Z.  I'll need at least one to win.

#note Again this was a misstep in the endgame that luckily didn't matter.  I thought ADOZE 15a went SPAZ/OW/ATOP for a 527-528 loss.  Seeing that, I thought this went APO/OW/AS for a 529-524 win, or other routes such as ASP/OW/MOA, a 529-525 win.  I was kind of being optimistic and stopped looking since I knew for sure that ADOZE 15a lost.  Turns out my route wasn't even close.
