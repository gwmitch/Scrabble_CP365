#note I guess METH. I'm not really sold on the leave as being that great,  but EGOT is also very, very bad.
>Opponent: EPSSTTV 8L ..VS +24 236
>Kenji: EEEGORT 14I EGO +23 186
#note GORE is definitely safer, but EGO isn't so bad considering his probable range here.  I like playing EGO based on implication.

#note WO is better here.  There's no reason to really expect he has the P, and it's not over even if he does.  The T is a very valuable tile here.  Note that TRANQ, the Quackle play here is awful.

#note This is a play I just ran out of time on.  I don't see ANY outs with any play.  I guess WOO c12 has a few outs, but heck, these all look terrible.
