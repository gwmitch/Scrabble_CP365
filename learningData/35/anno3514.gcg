#note I STILL would've played the anagram last turn, even though this worked out much better.

#note Very lazy.  RETSINA is better.

>Opponent: AEGOUVY E4 VOYAGEU. +80 347
#note Pretty devastating turn of events.  After turn 3 I was a pretty big favorite on a pretty safe board.  After scoring 131 points my next 2 turns, I am now about an 8-1 dog.

>Kenji: EGIMORT F5 MOG +22 345
#note MOTIVE is better.  EIRT ain't going anywhere in all likelihood after MOG completely wrecks what little is left of the board.  MOG for 4 less isn't much better.  Even if it does, I'm probably not going to win anyway, so the points are useful.  MOG is kind of an autopilot play, which is probably not too far from my mindset at this point.
