>Sue_Tremblay: ENO 8H ONE +6 6
>Matthew: FKNSTVZ J7 Z.K +16 16
#note I'm not sure why I tried to play through this. And Z(O)NK is obviously better. Trade FKNTV wins the sim. (-8.1)
>Sue_Tremblay: EOW 9H WO.E +20 26
>Matthew: CFINSTV L7 FIN +19 35
#note (V)OW for 9 sims best. Again, I'm making bad plays because there are no good ones. FIN sucks. It's a shame I had nothing ending in -NTS to fit in row 10. (-8.3)
>Sue_Tremblay: ILNO 10F LINO +15 41
>Matthew: CNSTUVV -CUVV +0 35
#note I knew Sue wouldn't let me have CUNTS! 43 points blocked and now I have to take 0! I let the sim run for a long time and my play barely edges out all others. I was tempted to turn over more tiles.
>Sue_Tremblay: ADELPY M3 PLAYED +35 76
>Matthew: NPRRSTX 5L P.X +12 47
#note I have a hard time exchanging twice in a row. But Quackle doesn't. Best is ex. NRX. Best non-exchange is RAX, and that word just completely eluded me for some reason. (-8.9)
>Sue_Tremblay: AQST 11E QATS +37 113
>Matthew: INORRST 12B TORI +19 66
#note Best is 12C. I saw it but wanted to open the board more and I thought NRS was a better leave than RST (it's not?). 7L (FE)R also sims high, but I'm scoring too low as it is. (-4.5)
>Sue_Tremblay: EORV B10 VO.ER +32 145
>Matthew: AGINRSV G2 RAVINGS +68 134
#note Missing the S(PLAYED) hook. Dur. (-5.5)
>Sue_Tremblay: ENSTW 13A N.WEST +42 187
>Matthew: AABDJUY 3B JUBAY. +36 170
#note What was I thinking? I don't know. But it blows all valid plays out of the water!
>Sue_Tremblay: ?AELRRT 14F ALTEReR +64 251
#note There's nothing better.
>Matthew: AAADEEH 15G AAHED +44 214
>Sue_Tremblay: ACDEHIR 1G CHAIRED +106 357
#note Oof.
>Matthew: ADEGMNT E2 M.GNATED +74 288
>Matthew: ADEGMNT --  -74 214
#note I was 50/50 and I'm not going to win this playing cautiously. There's only one eight with this rack. (-39.0)
>Sue_Tremblay: CLMOU 6B COLUM. +22 379
>Matthew: ADEGMNT 13K MAG +19 233
#note Trying to open it up for a bingo here, but Q says 2F A(R)MED which is hard to spot. (-16.1)
>Sue_Tremblay: FOU 4J FOU. +22 401
>Matthew: BDEEINT A13 .EB +17 250
#note I'm going to continue losing a bunch of points because I want to bingo so badly. (-8.5)
>Sue_Tremblay: ?EEGIOS N9 ISOGEnE +75 476
#note Inexplicably allowed this. It looked funny at first but then I remembered ISOGENIC. It's just GENOISE and SOIGNEE here. How long have I known this? (-75.0)
>Matthew: DEIINTT N2 TI +8 258
#note Blocking PIU.
>Sue_Tremblay: IU D3 .I +8 484
>Matthew: DEINT O1 TIED +28 286
>Sue_Tremblay: U 7L ..U +6 490
>Sue_Tremblay:  (N) +2 492
#note Total equity lost: 174.9
