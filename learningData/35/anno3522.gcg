#note An absolutely horrible play.  This rack is plenty good to fish with (TITS), and even if it weren't, STING 1h is a perfectly good option.

#note As bad as SITTING was, this might have been worse.  My thought was that I could draw QA or Q? and have either SQUAT o11 or QUOTA a4 for 70+ points.  However, I failed to realize that even on the very long shot that I hit it, I won't even win, as my opponent has very high point plays themselves most of the time and can go out in two.  I'd pretty much have to draw AQ? to win, and I have much better chances at winning trying to fish for a bingo (for example with OVA)  While not a bad idea, this was very poor application of good preendgame technique.
