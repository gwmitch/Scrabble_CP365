>Joan_Kelly: GLO 8G LOG +8 8
>Jason: DORSTUW 9F DOW +16 16
#note Curses, no open A to bingo through. Curses, no spot to play WUD. But this or WORD at 9H is Q's pick. (-0.2)
>Joan_Kelly: AHIK 7H HAIK +25 33
>Jason: AANRSTU K5 AU. +14 30
#note Another super-close call. Six plays within a point, take your pick. Q likes TUNA at L4. (-0.7)
>Joan_Kelly: CRRSUY L7 SCURRY +40 73
>Jason: ?AANRST 6B ANTiARS +70 100
#note RATAN(I)eS at J2 would've been sweet. (-1.7)
>Joan_Kelly: AAEILMR D4 MA.ERIAL +72 145
#note Thanks to this play, I had Madonna's "Material Girl" stuck in my head for much of the rest of the game. And now.
>Jason: ?EEEEFJ 4K JEFE +43 143
#note The game-turning play. I knew if I got a bingo with the S in the middle next turn, the game would be all but over. There was already a super-lucrative S hook ... why not create another? Esp. with her with a random rack and only two S's left? Q likes it, but now the game starts to get interesting.
>Joan_Kelly: BMO 8L .OMB +30 175
>Jason: ?DEENTV 11H iNVE.TED +72 215
#note DuVET(i)NE at E1 would've been superhuman. OK, good news bad news time. Good news, bingo goes down. Bad news, this is not a good board for a player up 40. With my hand in the bag, I said to myself "Draw one of the other two S's and you win this game." That became my mission for the rest of the game. (-9.9)
>Joan_Kelly: DZ N10 Z.D +33 208
#note When she put the Z where she did, my heart nearly stopped.
>Jason: ALNOPTU C9 PLANT +31 246
#note OK, boys and girls, fasten your seat belts, 'cause we're in for a bumpy ride on the way home. This turns over, it scores. Right now, I'm not as concerned with my leave as I am with turnover and trying to somewhat blunt these juicy -S hooks. (As proof, I'll tell you the this U doesn't leave my rack until the endgame.) Q's pick is (D)ONUT, which is palatable. (-7.7)
>Joan_Kelly: ENOV O11 .OVEN +34 242
>Jason: EFGINOU 3L FINO +31 277
#note OK, now she can't have free reign of either -S hook. But they're still both pretty dangerous. Duck approves.
>Joan_Kelly: X 6J X. +50 292
#note I'm not good at seeing X bombs when the X isn't on my rack. Hmph.
>Jason: EGIORUU B11 GUIRO +20 297
#note OK, this is not quite unfolding the way I'd like. I knew this was way gutsy, but I've already committed myself to this balls-to-the-wall strategy ... no time to get wimpy now. Pleasantly surprised Q agrees. Although passing keeping R or ER is an option.
>Joan_Kelly: CEIT A8 CITE +23 315
#note I breathe an internal sigh of relief as she slightly lets up on the scoring pressure.
>Jason: DEIOTUW 15A W.ODIE +36 333
#note "Living in a material world ... and I am a material girl ..."
>Joan_Kelly: IQS G13 QIS +33 348
>Jason: AABEOTU 15A .......T +36 369
#note D'oh! I saw this was ABOITEAU-I, but I didn't see the I as being able to be bingoed through! Argh! Not too concerned about the vowel-heavy leave ... AE plays at 9N for 23. Finally running out of places to score, I can't let her have this cheap 36. (-62.6)
>Joan_Kelly: HP 14E PH. +33 381
>Jason: AABEOSU O1 BO.S +37 406
#note The S is a most welcome sight. It's just about sewn up now. (-9.2, to BEANO at C3)
>Joan_Kelly: ETY 5B YE.T +23 404
>Joan_Kelly: ETY --  -23 381
#note Well, that was interesting. It took me like four minutes to challenge, because I knew I won by keeping it on and I had me losing by two with a wrong challenge. So I had to be near 100%, which I was. But still, I was having flashbacks to the Aune Mitchell game and INTWINES. I nearly kept it on to take the sure win. Eventually, though, I trusted myself.
>Jason: AAEEENU J10 A.ENUE +13 419
#note Duck is on crack. Zero chance AA at 9N is better for spread. (-19.9???)
>Joan_Kelly: EGIIRTY N14 YE +22 403
#note GYR(i), nine better.
>Jason: AEL C3 LEA. +14 433
#note A win, but with more stress than there probably should've been.
>Jason:  (GIIRT) +12 445
