#note I chose this over QATS to prevent a consonant heavy rack next turn.
>Bing: BCKLLMR F6 CL.RK +27 163
>Joey: AAGIIOU I4 IGUA.A +9 107
#note Well, that's definitely not very consonant heavy.  I should probably exchange most, if not all of this garbage.
>Bing: ?ABDILM H1 LIMBA +46 209
#note Obviously much better than BIMoDAL J9 (the only bingo).
>Joey: AIIOTTV B2 VITTA +24 131
>Bing: ?DEIOSU 1F SO.ItUDE +60 269
#note Missed DIEcIOUS 2G (6 more points).
>Joey: EEINOOR J4 OE +11 142
#note The same letters score two more points at G7.
>Bing: AELRTUU K5 RUT +16 285
#note I couldn't very well leave the big spot open, but a good alternative is LUAU J9, crippling the spot and cleaning up the rack.
>Joey: EINOORV 15C .RIVEN +33 175
#note I must have thought DEVOIR was French only.  That's clearly better than DRIVEN.
>Bing: AEEELNU E10 AE +15 300
#note Didn't see ANELE (2J).
>Joey: DFFOORT 2L OFF +26 201
#note This time saving OO worked out better.  Might as well play TOFF instead.
>Bing: EEILNUY G8 .EY +23 323
>Joey: DIORTYZ 14G DITZ +39 240
#note Keeping the Y for next turn.  Hopefully I'll still have time to bingo after that.

#note To block PIXY if he had it. 
>Joey: EEPRSXY O1 ESPY +49 322
#note PYREXES wouldn't be a nongo had I played TOFF!  I'm sure he would have adjusted accordingly but still....
