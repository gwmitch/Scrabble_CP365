>Jason_Keller: EILNNOV 8G NONLIVE +78 78
#note JI: *Sigh* What can I say? I hated it, but it's not in my prob. range, it's in his, and I've never seen him phony me. He picked a good time to start. Played like a Stradivarius.
#note JK: I guess I was feeling rather brash that morning, because it's not in my nature to phony unless it's a mistake.  I've been told to keep this under 10,000 words.  Someone later said that when she awoke that morning, she had no energy, was feeling so NONLIVE*.
>Jason: ?AELOOY 7M YO +18 18
#note JI: Gutsy. Probably too gutsy, which I thought even at the time (esp. since JK wasn't sighing as he is wont to do with clunky tiles). Ten plays simming within two points of each other, and I couldn't pick any of them. (-4.9)
>Jason_Keller: DEEGORT O7 DOGE +25 103
#note JK: Still feeling brash, my immediate thought was that YO was a setup for the O column, but I should have played GEODE for a few more points.  GO(I)TERED* crossed my mind given the previous turn.
>Jason: ?AEIKLO 7C KAOLInE +74 92
#note JI: Scores one more than hALO(L)IKE or KE(L)OIdAL, neither of which I knew.
#note JK: He should have shown KIE first to get back in psychologically.
>Jason_Keller: ACENORT E4 COR.NATE +90 193
#note JK: Slightly better than the other double-double, K5 ACTIONER.  I could swear that someone just said that that never comes up.
>Jason: BDEFIMV 6L FEM +30 122
#note JI: Things already looking bad for the home team. And they look worse when I whiff on BEDIM at N10. (-6.2)
#note JK: You're in New Jersey, my home state, at a tournament run by one of the clubs at which I am a regular, and yet you call *yourself* the home team?  The actual home team is in good shape here.
>Jason_Keller: AEORSWY N10 WEARY +51 244
>Jason: ABDFIVZ 12D ADZ +38 160
#note JI: Too obsessed with the D hook. VIZA(R)D scores the same, turns over two more with eight power tiles out, and leaves better. (-8.8)
>Jason_Keller: AHINOST M12 HAO +26 270
#note JK: Missing 4E CHITOSAN.  Otherwise the duck wants me to fish at O14 with OH.
>Jason: ABFGIMV L11 FAB +33 193
#note JI: Chickened out on GAMB. Missed IAMB. This may me a good time to mention that this was the first game of the day and I spent most of the previous night tossing and turning. Stupid nerves... (-7.0)
>Jason_Keller: AINNRST 10C IN.RANTS +62 332
#note JK: It took me a little while to find, but I got it.
>Jason: GIIMNUV 13B VUM +20 213
#note JI: Sim clearly likes VI(C)ING, but I don't mind this play. No matter what I play, winning chances are <1%. (-10.6)
>Jason_Keller: EEEHIST 4C TE.HIE +24 356
#note JK: Trying to turn over and speed to the endgame here.  Best in win percentage.
>Jason: DGIINOT A12 DOIT +30 243
#note JI: Missing INDIGO, but again, I think this play is defensible. (-4.9)
>Jason_Keller: ?EEGSTU 15A .UG +4 360
#note JK: I make a blocking fish here, forgetting that I have the case blank and am probably more likely to bingo.  Bad move.  Duck says G10 AGE.
>Jason: EGINOQX 3B QI +26 269
#note Q says there's no urgency to getting rid of the Q and likes OX at 3F. I disagree. I got two good OX spots and I need to score and create another line. This did the job. (-10.8)
>Jason_Keller: ?CEESTW H10 .EWEST +39 399
#note JK: I think I deserved a UW draw for the last move, but CW is close enough.  I go back to putting the foot on the gas here.
>Jason: EGILNOX I12 OX +39 308
#note JI: "Well," I thought, "at least I stand a good chance of keeping spread within 100."
>Jason_Keller: ?BCEIRS 3H aSCRIBE +73 472
#note JK: BICkERS and BIRChES are three points better and don't give back hooks, but this seals the win just as well.  I just went with the first thing that I saw.
>Jason: ADEGILN O1 GAD +27 335
#note JI: That was frustrating, to finally have the bingo and watch the board die. DEIG(N) at 8A is Q's pick. (-5.4)
>Jason_Keller: AJPSTUU 14F JU. +26 498
#note JK: Maybe PUJAS in the same spot?
>Jason: EILLNPR 15H .RILL +6 341
#note JI: Second, five back of PRILL at 2C, which I don't remember.
>Jason_Keller: AIPRSTU 8A TRAI. +27 525
#note JK: 2L TAPA is slightly better.  At some point around here, JI asked me if I wanted a cigarette or if I'd prefer to cuddle.
#note JI: Frank threatened to publish that comment on LJ, but since he hadn't, I'd hoped that I'd dodged that bullet. Since I ended up winning and JK finished third at 9-5, I can't be too upset with this result.
>Jason: ENP L1 PE.N +18 359
