>Jason_Keller: AIOOPST 8D PATIO +20 20
>Jason: BMOOSTW 7C MOB +18 18
#note JI: One of those racks that I punch in and immediately wonder why I didn't play WOMB(A)T. I thought this was a few more than WOMB at 7H or 9H ... nope, just one. Yeah, this play sucks. (-9.5)
>Jason_Keller: ILOSTVV G7 V.OL +12 32
>Jason: IOPQSTW 6D POW +28 46
#note JI: Or WOP. Hoping to cash in on the S- front hook soon.
>Jason_Keller: FIJSTUV 11E JUST +30 62
#note JK: FUJIS on this line is better.  I think I was concerned about losing vowels.  They could come back into my rack since I would be drawing five.
>Jason: BIQRSST I9 QIS +34 80
#note JI: No-brainer, so a random story. The attention whore in me likes the comments about the "official Jason uniform", but sometimes it goes a little far. A lower division player I didn't know walked into the playing room, leading her friend by the arm. "Look," she said, one arm pointed at each of us (we were on opposite sides of the room at the time). "Those are the guys I was telling you about. They dress like twins!" I felt like a zoo exhibit.
>Jason_Keller: ADFINTV J8 DIF +39 101
>Jason: BEKRSTY K5 TYKES +39 119
#note JI: Or at H11. Just whiffed. Given how this board is almost dead for S's, my unwillingness to raw into three consonants and no vowels, and the extra 14 points, adding the S was a no-brainer. (-2.8)
>Jason_Keller: AEINRTV 8J ..VEIN +42 143
#note JK: I think I may have written "CALM DOWN!" in large caps on my scoresheet at this point, because I was annoyed that 8J DIVERT was blocked, but this worked.
>Jason: ABDEGLR J3 GRAB +28 147
#note JI: The seven won't play, so I GRAB as many points as I can while keeping a potent leave. A lot of plays here (GAB, LAB, ARDEB, DEB, this) sim closely. (-1.6)
>Jason_Keller: AAAENRT 3I A.ATE +14 157
#note JK: I6 AA gives a super leave for a bingo.  Lots of places to play AA sim better than this, but many of them close off lines and could leave me snookered or hard-pressed.
>Jason: CDEEILN 4C DECLINE. +76 223
#note JI: I tried to sell doubt in this word with body language, etc., but I never was a good actor. JK holds but wisely doesn't challenge.
#note JK: I wasn't noticing body language.
>Jason_Keller: ADGINRT M7 D.RATING +76 233
#note JK: JI whined that I held his play and then laid down a TANGREDI bingo.
#note JI: I did not "whine". I just said "Are you kidding me?" about 19 times. :)
>Jason: AENOORU 14I AERU.O +18 241
#note JI: (T)AUON accomplishes the same goals without being overly ballsy. (-1.8)
>Jason_Keller: GHILRWX 15F WHIRL +37 270
#note JK: If you have a visceral reaction to my not playing XI here, I made a smart choice (or, at least, a smart choice at the time) not to leave myself with five consonants here.  Duck wants this at 15E for two points fewer, or 15G WHIR.  XI is well-back.  
>Jason: ?DEFNNO 12D FON +23 264
#note JI: I took a long time on this play. I hated that all my scoring plays blocked good bingo lines. This sims second, but the star play stuns me. FON(D) at C1 sims 10+ points ahead of the field? I never considered it. Same leave, scores seven less, and just asks for a huge counterplay in return. Not to mention it constricts row 2 bingos. How can it be so far ahead? Thoughts? (-12.2)
#note JK: It seems to be setting up two possible ways to bingo to a TWS?
>Jason_Keller: EEGLUUX L10 LUX +42 312
#note JK: O7 UNGLUE is preferred slightly.  I was thinking about scoring rather than ridding myself of drek.  It would have been a game-changer.
>Jason: ?ADEINR O1 ENDbRAI. +74 338
#note JI: In honor of Brendan Sullivan. Highest scoring bingo by 11.
>Jason_Keller: EEEEGUZ 13C ZEE +39 351
#note JK: Best... behind a bunch of exchanges.  I'm supposed to keep the Z here.  After reverse-engineering the bag, I see that AAEEOSY? is left, and I guess that maybe I could pull a reasonable six tiles, I win.
>Jason: CHMNORT 15N HM +26 364
#note JI: Tough call. I stupidly thought the pool was balanced (forgetting that this late, my rack vastly changes that assessment). I deduced from JK's body language that I needn't be worried about 2C bingos and shouldn't make a play like CORM (which I considered with ?S out). Just trying to stop him from making an EASY 32 points at O12. Whatever my logic, CP agrees. (-6.9, to CHON at 3A)
#note JK: If I had an EASY 32 points at O12, then I would have had an EASY 45 at 14B.
>Jason_Keller: AEEGIOU N1 OE +10 361
#note JK: Draw screws me here.  CP says L1 AUTO, I guess hoping that he can't bingo?  I feel like any play that I make here is going to lose, but now I'm thinking G2 AGIO?  Thoughts???
#note JI: It was hard to see JK winning after this play no matter what. In a situation like this, sometimes you gotta assume I have the worst of it, assume ? or ?S is in the bag and go from there. It's also a way to have a consistently lousy spread, though.
>Jason: CENORST 2C CORNETS +64 428
#note JI: Yeah, ES here was one of many lucky draws this weekend.
#note JK: I'm trying really hard not to make a snarky comment here.
>Jason_Keller: ?AEGIUY 14B GAYs +44 405
>Jason: A C2 .A. +12 440
>Jason:  (EIU) +6 446
