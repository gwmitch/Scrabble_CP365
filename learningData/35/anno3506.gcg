#note Another example of how a play that Quackle originally hates does much better in a sim than previously indicated.  Quackly likes fishing slightly better but I can't stand it here.

#note Quackle thinks I'm gambling a little too much here and likes the more conventional bailor or aboil.  ABOIL seems reasonable anyway.

#note These last two games are definitely not what I'm going for.  I feel like I didn't really have a choice in this one, but if we keep playing 550-450 games I'm not going to win in the long run.
