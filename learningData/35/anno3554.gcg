>moh: ADEJORT H7 JO +18 18
#note Everything except the J is bingo-prone, so I wanted to keep as much of it together as possible.
>johnny: DEIOOOV I3 VIDEO +24 24
#note I5 OVOID 24 is a little better, but VIDEO was a fine play, especially if you weren't familiar with OVOID (which is an egg-shaped object).
>moh: ADEEQRT 4H Q. +21 39
#note Another easy decision. Get rid of the Q and keep the very nice REDATE combo.
>johnny: GILNNOO 9F LOGO +18 42
#note GLONOIN was available, but it's not a miss at this point. Just another word to tuck away for a rainy day. Hooking (JO)G was right, but you could have improved your leave quite a bit by undoubling your Ns with Something like LINGO or GOON.
>moh: ADEEORT J5 ODE +28 67
#note I had to break up a pretty nice set in order to score, but the AERT is nothing to complain about. 
>johnny: ?GIMNNN 10I MaNNING +65 107
#note The only bingo! Nicely done!
>moh: AAEERRT O8 RA.E +15 82
#note I played off one of each of my doubled tiles and kept a nice AERT combo, but I might've given up too many points. O8 ER(G)ATE scores 9 more points and is probably a bit better.
>johnny: AAEFHIN 9L AH +20 127
#note This is a case where short word knowledge can make a big difference. K4 FEH (which also makes the oddish EDH) scores 33 and is pretty nice. Even better, the totally wacky HAAF scores 35 at 11J. Your AH was fine, given that you might not have known EDH, FEH, or HAAF.
>moh: AEEPRTV 8A REPAVE +38 120
#note REPAVE or PAREVE at 8A are pretty clearly best.
>johnny: AEFINNS 12I FANNIES +79 206
#note Another nice one. FANNIES was the only bingo, and you found the best placement (it also played at 11C).
>moh: GIKOOTU K3 TUG +18 138
#note Ugh! I got fixated on the 2W spot at 5K, but the real hotspot was at 10F (ELK). Bad miss.
>johnny: ADELLOY L2 CUP +24 230
>johnny: ADELLOY --  -24 206
#note Thank you for keeping me in this one with TU*.
>moh: EIKOTUX 10E OKE +36 174
#note Normally I'd rather shed a U over an O with UKE, but I wanted to set up a big spot for my X on the next play. If you cover 11E, which is not unlikely, you will probably end up giving me another big spot for my X at 12D.
>johnny: ACPSUYZ 11C PAY +26 232
#note It's probably best to get rid of the U here. Also, it's worth using your S to hook (ELK)S (the rule of thumb is that if you can earn an extra 8-9 points, go ahead and spend the S). 11B YAUPS 36 is a good play. Also nice is D10 YUCA 29. 
>moh: EIILTUX 12A ILEX +46 220
#note Easy and obvious.
>johnny: ?COSTUZ B6 CU. +11 243
#note Tough position. B12 (L)UTZ, which wins the sim, is unattractive because of the Z placement. And B11 S(L)UT doesn't score much, given that you'd be spending your S and opening a triple lane. I'd take CO(I)TUS at A10 (heck, I'd take coitus anywhere!).
>moh: BCIIRTU 13A TIC +28 248
#note It's the only place to score much on this board.
>johnny: ?ORSSTZ A11 Z.. +12 255
#note The best play is 10C ST(OKE) 27. The spot doesn't look very appealing, though, so it's easy to miss.
>moh: BHIILRU 9B RIB +21 269
#note Sorry about the phony here. CUER* is no good.
>johnny: ?FORSST 11C ...S +17 272
#note Interesting position. You're very close to a bingo, but short on vowels. Also, that F is hurting your bingo chances a little. 13L OFT 26 takes the lead and opens up a nice lane for the bingo you hope to play soon. With the N column also open, a decent draw should yield a bingo. Another option, while not for the faint of heart, is B12 (LI)FT. While it opens up the 3x3 lane, you have great tiles ti either use the T (of LIFT), or play parallel to my play through the T. Your play was not a bad play, for the record. You undoubled your Ss, but in keeping the F, you lowered your bingo chances, and bingoing* should be your #1 priority with a rack like this.
>moh: BHILLOU N4 HULLO +12 281
#note I considered plays like 14C HULL and 14C HULLO, but I didn't like giving you a lane that wide open. With your single-tile Z play, I assumed you had good bingo tiles, and probably the blank. My thinking, right or wrong, was that I'd like to kill the N-column bingos; the bingos along row 14 are a little harder.
>johnny: ?FORSTU A11 ...iS +39 311
#note 13L OFT is the play (again). (ZIT)iS scores 13 more points than OFT, which is not early enough to justify the blank use.
>moh: ADDIITY 6A A.IDITY +15 296
#note I was glad to see the blank on the board without a bingo, but it still left me down 30 with clunky tiles. I should have kept my best tiles together with a play like L5 YID 16. O1 DITA is not a bad play, but that Y is likely to limit my bingo chances.
>johnny: AFORSTU 13L OF +22 333
#note A play at O1 was probably in order. TUFA (for 30 to go up by more than 40), for instance, or FARO or FORA if you didn't know TUFA. After TUFA, the only bingo opportunities I have are from the S (A15) and to the T (O1). While that's not a dead board, with no blanks and a dwindling bag, it gives you pretty good winning chances (better than 80%). Your play, OF, opens up a really flexible spot for sevens; any seven than ends in D, T, S, R, or (unlikely) M will now play across row 14.
>moh: ADENRTW L2 WANED +30 326
#note WANED was definitely not the play. O1 DAWEN 38 is best.
>johnny: AMRSTTU A1 TRAUM. +27 360
#note You could have crushed my hopes with STRATUM at either 14C or 14F. Even better, STRATUMS at 15A. TRAUMA is the best non-bingo, giving you a better than 70% chance of winning.
>moh: AEERRTW 14F WATERER +73 399
#note The late bingo saves the day! Good game.
>moh:  (BEIST) +14 413
