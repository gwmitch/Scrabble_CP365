>Kate: AIMOOOR 8D MOIRA +20 20
#note I can't believe I'm at table one! This is my first time ever here, so I'm shaky as hell. Kate was sympathetic though
>Avery: BEENTTU 7C BUTTE +22 22
#note Didn't even see BRUNETTE, but this is second.
>Kate: BEIOOPU 9C UPO +16 36
#note BIOTOPE is what Quackle says, but the live coverage game says UPO is best. I like UPO
>Avery: AEEFLNO 6A FEAL +21 43
#note 6G plays didn't seem that good. Quackle likes FOAL over FEAL but I like this for diversity
>Kate: ?BDEEIO A3 BIO.EEDs +92 128
>Kate: ?BDEEIO --  -92 36
#note It took me forever to challenge this off. I was scared as hell lol
>Avery: CEELNOW A6 .LOWN +33 76
#note FLEW
>Kate: ?BDEEIO I7 BIO +17 53
>Avery: CEEFISW 5D FEW +30 106
#note Live coverage says FICE is better by .03%, but Quackle likes this by 6 points. I stand by this one.
>Kate: ?DDEEHI 9H H.IDEnED +67 120

#note JIMPER
>Kate: AEELNTT O2 TALENTE. +80 230
>Avery: DEEGRTU 10J DETER +29 249
#note Live coverage says this is 4, but GUIDE is easily best. 
>Kate: ADOOOYZ 5H AZ.DO +38 268
#note AZO 
>Avery: ?GNRRUY L8 R..URN +14 263
#note Barely makes it off of the static choices, but still sucks
>Kate: AHLOOXY 4E HOLY +33 301
#note I don't remember what her reasoning was for this, but I liked it. I like saving the O for row 2 though regardless.
>Avery: ?AAEGTY 11K Y.GA +36 299
>Kate: AEGKOVX N1 OAK +24 325
#note EVOKE
>Avery: ?AAENOT 2E TAO +14 313
#note Live coverage hates this, Quackle likes it. MOA maybe, but blocking the SHE hook seemed ok. she took a while on OAK so I figured her leave was subpar
>Kate: EGGRVVX B2 VERG. +18 343
#note VERVE, but frustration from a draw like that is reasonable
>Avery: ?AENRSU 13F UNlEAR.S +68 381
#note Live coverage and a sim agree this is best
>Kate: AGISSVX 10F XIS +32 375
>Avery: CI I11 IC. +5 386
