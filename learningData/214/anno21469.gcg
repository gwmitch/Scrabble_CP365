#note DORK seemed a bit wieldier of a leave than DKU after PROOF. Sim also likes KOTO because DPRU apparently bingoes 17% of the time here, which seems pretty high given that leave and the board condition, but I suppose the E in column K is hittable. I'd still take POUF.

#note The start of an annoying sequence that I badly misplayed. I was cognizant of my play turning the game into a race for the S some of the time and I didn't really want that, but FINED also yields some easier scores in a back-and-forth game where that might matter.

#note Yuck. So obviously my general thinking here was between NAOI and both placements of TOEA at first, missing TEABOX completely, and then I decided sacrificing some points to block BOXY would be worth doing. Except that I'm sacrificing way, way too many points to guard against plays that probably score in the low 30s at most, and that probably play elsewhere for decent scores as well. Obviously TEABOX blocks the Y hook while also scoring a boatload more points.

#note Another clunker. I don't think DITZ even crossed my mind as the perfect play to score just as well while also fouling up the increasingly dangerous bingo lanes. My move is just asking for Joe to finish me off with a bingo now, especially considering he's dinking of one or two tiles per turn at this point.

#note And on this turn, I was so close to playing THY and inexplicably decided against it because I was worried about plays like VALSE outscoring me. Again, blind to the idea of playing from 6K, this time with DUTY.
