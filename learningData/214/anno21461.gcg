#note Certainly considered BOX here too, but playing the sim-winning 14G SWOB (or STOW) never remotely crossed my mind. Eliminating the row 15 triple triple and setting up the X looks quite strong.

#note This was a super interesting move! I didn't consider B1 SHOEBOX whatsoever, but gave long consideration to BOX, OXO, and B8 HOTBOX. HOTBOX and OXO are closer to the same class of play, trading one type of volatility (triple triples) for another (massive non-bingo scoring plays). Of course, at this score, the massive non-bingo scoring plays are preferable. The nice thing about OXO is that I keep the heaviest hook to OPE remaining in my leave, the H, and if Doug somehow doesn't play there next turn, I often draw a word that plays down from A8 and seal off both 9x threats for good in a two-turn sequence. Hopefully, the way the game actually proceeded will be a useful lesson to me for future positions like this.
