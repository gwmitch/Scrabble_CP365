#note Feeling grateful that I had successfully made it to Nationals but still running on not much sleep after some stress the previous day. I had braced myself for being 0-2, so receiving an unexpected bye was a welcome surprise. Then I got to play someone friendly and drew three esses.

>Will: AEELNSS 11D LEAN +28 63
#note Pretty close with a lot of stuff. Cesar knows I have one S at least so playing LEAS over LEAN isn't giving any special info away. The sim results show that LEAS yields fewer points and bingos more often than LEAN, yet LEAN averages about the same number of points on my next turn. I guess the LEANS scoring plays I get when I don't bingo are just enough to push it ahead. Another option would be NAES, which yields nothing at all to the triple and makes the board even harder to bingo on without an S.
>Cesar: CDEFOR C8 FORCED +33 52
>Will: EEIIPSS B12 PIE +17 80
#note Almost did H11 SPIES, J8 SIPE, and D4 PEISE. Didn't consider just 8C FIE, which is by far most defensive and bingos the most as well. My play is just far too volatile and doesn't bingo enough to be worth that risk.

>Will: AADIIOU -AIIOU +0 172
#note Not quite sure I have the stomach for 14D AUDIO or J9 DIAZO and even M7 AUDIO is kind of scary - I think x7 was the play here. What's the point of keeping AD? Not adjusting enough to the availability of blanks in the unseen pool was a recurring issue for me, at least early on.

#note Not sure I even considered ZAX...must have still been in a waxy state of mind. At least WAXIER blocks the top lines a bit. Can't tell much about Cesar after BANJO.
