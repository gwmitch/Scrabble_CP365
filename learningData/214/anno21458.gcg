#note Close with MONTANES - maybe after his bingo just taking the extra few points works out better than if he were to have played a low number of tiles.

#note Interesting move here. I did WAUK to block easy ZA hooking plays, but only GSS still plays there from the unseen tiles, and the esses are likely usable elsewhere for good scores too like AMUS. It's also not even a bingo lane. With so many candidate plays available, I preferred a play keeping the N to try for DEPONENT, which scores nicely here - better than any play I have available on this turn, for example. L10 FUCK is a play with good upside, since it also keeps the W for HAWKIE/HAWKER 13I plays afterwards and also blocks the board a bit better than a play like H11 CAW, which doesn't do much to the board at all. 4-ply sim suggests a big jump in bingo percentage on my second turn after the play, whereas most of the other candidate plays (WAUK, CAW, 1A FANG) don't experience much of a jump at all from my first subsequent turn to the next. Would be glad to hear arguments for what to do on this turn.

>Will: AABCDFN 3I FA +24 352
#note I missed the full-on tupik of ALBINIC C5, which sets up the nice DRAFF B2 with an R draw and takes 4 shots at drawing the increasingly scarce vowels. Another interesting play is 2M FAB, which gets rid of my clunkers in a deceivingly non-threatening way while keeping a leave that can sometimes bingo and finish the game immediately. My play of FA isn't awful, but not as good as ALBINIC.

#note I miss a second tupik, M8 BEDPAN. After Trey just used up SS? and two vowels, I'm thinking I'm a favorite headed into this endgame. BEDPAN would have earned me a big extra chunk of winning percentage. At least BANED keeps two vowels and a consonant, which looks great headed into the endgame.
