>Joey: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Rafi: CEFGOTY 8D FOGEY +32 32
>Joey: ACELRST E4 SECT.RAL +90 90
>Rafi: ABCISTU D3 CUB +22 54
#note Thought about CUBIT vs CUB. CUB bingos 43% vs CUBIT's 30%, and Joey scores 7 points more after CUBIT. But 8 immediate points + not screwing up the left side of the board are important considerations.
>Joey: HOW F10 HOW +32 122
>Rafi: AILNSTT I2 LATTINS +72 126
#note I almost convinced myself that LATTINS was no good. D- for this play, because I took 4 minutes.
>Joey: ADGI H1 GADI +29 151
>Rafi: ?DEJMQR -JMQ +0 126
#note Didn't even consider playing through with Qu(AL)M for 41. If HOWE gets blocked, the bingo lanes on this board aren't really that great at all. QI is also better than usual because MAJORED/JUMARED/JEMIDAR/JEMADAR can happen. QuALM makes a lot of sense... too often if I bingo it's going to be a cheapie through the I that gives a lot back.
>Joey: EGIMR 13B GRIME +26 177
>Rafi: ?DERRUV B13 .UV +14 140
#note Took a long time on this turn before noticing this obvious #1 play by valuation upon simulation of all choices. The V is not easy for Joey to score on, and if he plays elsewhere I triple triple with evey O+vowel draw. All of my plays this turn were among the top 1 plays, as well as the top 10. A+
>Joey: AEOT 15A O.ATE +27 204
>Rafi: ?DEFRRY 6G RE.FY +19 159
#note Bad play. Took a long time again. For some reason I wasn't very confident of GRIMED but that shouldn't matter... I didn't even see all the best options there anyway. REIFY is awful for creating lanes, now and on future turns. 
>Joey: HIPP K2 HIPP. +30 234
>Rafi: ?DLNQRZ -DLQZ +0 159
#note Are you kidding me? I draw 4 consonants from a pool that contains more U's than B's? The shit I have to deal with. The Z didn't seem great to keep because how often is Joey really going to NOT use the HIPPY overlap? Considered ZN though for lucky ZING bingos or ZINE ZONA ZONE if I somehow still have that spot. Quackle prefers the Thai strategy of keeping the Z.
>Joey: AIILT L1 LITAI +31 265
>Rafi: ?DNOORX 12C OX +38 197
>Joey: DEO F2 DOE +11 276
>Rafi: ?DINNOR M5 aNDIRON +64 261
#note Went for the high volatility ANDIRON... didn't even look for NONDRIP. Also DOE indicates so JZ so ANDIRON hits me harder than it hits Joey.
>Joey: AAEINST 12I ENTASIA +74 350
>Rafi: ?AEERSV O8 AVER.gES +140 401
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-minute championship player.
>Joey: AQ K10 QA. +24 374
>Rafi: DIKNOOU 1L .OOK +24 425
#note LUNK > LOOK because the O's go better with the JZ left. Missed a TUPIK this turn... KO(I) in between AVERAGES and ANDIRONS. I should maybe just block with KOIN(E) because there are actually some bingos left in the pool... 8.6% chance actually.
>Joey: EJ 14M JE. +20 394
>Rafi: DIMNRUZ I11 R.Z +22 447
#note Championship player doesn't come up with REZ for some reason. It still wins 100%.
>Joey: BEELNUW 7A UNWE. +17 411
