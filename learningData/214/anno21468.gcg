>Will: ADGIMNN 9H NIM +19 19
>Joe: IIIII -IIIII +0 20
>Will: ADGINYZ H8 ..DY +8 27
#note Plays making UNI or GYP are so much more defensive, especially GID. UNDY is not a good choice.
>Joe: JTTU 11D JUTT. +30 50
>Will: AFGINYZ 11D .....ING +38 65
>Joe: ELOO 12A OLEO +28 78
>Will: AEFRTYZ A12 .YEZ +48 113
#note Hmm. I played OYEZ really fast, but FEZ does well because of the followup potential of 14A ARTY/EFT/JOEY, which I failed to consider. Still, it's hard to imagine that staying available for me.
>Joe: BDLO 13D BOLD +21 99
>Will: AAFLORT B11 F.OTA +36 149
#note Close, but not quite. FLORA because of the 5 unseen Rs and only 3 unseen Ts.
>Joe: ?AEIRRS 14E SIERRAn +69 168
>Will: AGLOORS 15J GOORAL +28 177
#note Missing AGLOO to keep RS together. A lot of second-best moves so far...
>Joe: EW 15G WE +28 196
>Will: AAELNSU 9G A...A +13 190
#note S hook madness
>Joe: ACDEIN M9 DANCIE. +24 220
>Will: CELNSTU O12 CUL. +9 199
#note Joe said he had ORIENTAL ready to go so it's quite lucky I didn't do 14M ET, as I had also considered.
>Joe: O G7 O.. +6 226
>Will: EEENSTX N9 EX +53 252
>Joe: AEEINRT O4 TRAINEE +88 314
>Will: ABEENST N6 BA +22 274
#note Sigh. Had ABSENTER written on my scoresheet and just couldn't pull the trigger - I knew some word or other in that grouping was phony and recalled postgame that it was ABSENCED* from Brian Bowman's BAT Premier from several years back.
>Joe: HM F6 HM +19 333
>Will: EEEKNST E5 KEET +26 300
#note I know I saw KEEN and that it accomplished the same things as KEET with a better leave, but I have no idea why I didn't play it.
>Joe: IRW 4L WRI. +14 347
>Will: EEINOSS 4C EOSINES +75 375
>Joe: ?DINRTV C1 INV.RTeD +72 419
>Will: AFIPQUV 1A QU.P +54 429
>Joe: S 1A ....S +16 435
#note Just a bit off this game, I guess.
>Joe:  (AFIV) +20 455
