#note Missed OILCAMP. Looking for something defensive against bingoes after YO. Maybe 9F TOPICAL and hope Jerry doesn't know the new S hook.
>Jerry: AEU 8A EAU +13 23

>Jerry: CDEIIRT 4F DITC.IER +80 103
>Jerry: CDEIIRT --  -80 23
>Will: AAIRRRT A7 T.RRARIA +59 180
#note Very tempting to play K2 TIARA and force RATICIDE or DIERETIC, but the upside of a second miss was pretty huge.
>Jerry: CDEIIRT 3J CITED +37 60
>Will: EENTVWX 5I W.XEN +30 210
#note Whiffed on VIEW, which is a gopik at most.
>Jerry: IIIIUU -IIIIUU +0 60
>Will: AEEOPTV 7C PAVE +22 232
#note Don't think I even looked for 8J plays here. Not the sharpest game for either of us.

#note 12A REDROVE or 13I VERSED look great.

#note I did this fully aware of the -ST bingo potential...just didn't seem like a big enough threat to play something else. Maybe F4 DOVE instead?

#note Checked my tracking a couple times to ensure I wasn't missing BEETROOT, and was fully aware that Jerry had BEIOORT - but didn't see what he was doing. Actually he had been trying for LIBRETTO with his eventual play as a backup. A clever plan...tricked me.
