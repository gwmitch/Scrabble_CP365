>Will: HINNTUY 8D HINNY +30 30
#note I considered UNITY and HINNY a tossup.
>Jesse: CEIRSUY C4 CRUISEY +76 76
>Will: AEORRTU 7H ORATURE +64 94
>Jesse: ?BIOTTX B5 OX +52 128

>Will: AGIINOT M7 .IGATONI +72 216
>Jesse: ?EIOSTT 4B S.OTTIEs +80 246
>Will: AJLORRT L12 JATO +46 262
#note Careless, definitely JOLT.
>Jesse: EELNOTW N10 TOWEL +48 294
>Will: DELNRRW O8 DREW +33 295
#note Thought about REWED, but it seemed to yield pretty nasty counterplay with an S and cripples the row 3 bingo line, which I felt I would need down tempo.
>Jesse: BEFINRS B10 BRIEF +45 339
>Will: DEGLNRV 13A V.NGED +22 317
#note The need for a bingo is getting larger. I played VENGED over LIVED and VIRL to try and grab that blank or an S most aggressively. It sims well, at least.
>Jesse: HIMNOSS 3G MHO +26 365
>Will: ACDEGLR N2 GALER. +33 350
#note GLEDE is better to keep the A for AMI, and playing from N1 to open the triple lane is probably better than GALERE to make it more difficult for Jesse to close everything off. It's still going to take a really good draw. 
>Jesse: AEIMNSS 15B SAMISEN +97 462
>Will: CDEILOU H1 OC.. +27 377
>Jesse: ?ANPPUV A7 PUPA +32 494
>Will: DDEILLU O1 DIE +17 394
#note NULL, then BETIDED is best, but I did play DIE with the hope that Jesse would miss the tricky ILLUDE and make what would otherwise be a sharp play, blocking my only out and retaining a couple decent Q scoring outs.
>Jesse: ?AAENQV 14G NAVE +13 507
>Will: DLLU E8 .LLUD. +14 408
>Will:  (?AQ) +22 430
