#note Tasha's Eventful Events in Reno, Episode 1 & Tasha's Endgame Misadventures, Episode 101.  I misplaced (or "accidently" destroyed) my scoresheets and so I have to annotate games by memory.  Fortunately (unfortunately?), I remember this game.  Vividly.  Oh, how I remember.  
>Tasha: ?CEEILR 8A RECLInE. +83 83
#note I made damn sure I didn't have a bingo with a P before playing this.
>Wallace_Schultz: BW 7G W.B +24 100
>Tasha: AADIOSV 6F VA. +20 103
#note I had two A's and I considered ADVISOR, VARIA, and VAT.  I decided on VAT because I wanted to keep as many lanes open as possible and to take out the most threatening 2x2 bingo lane.  I also didn't think it would be the greatest idea to break up my rack by playing off six tiles.
>Wallace_Schultz: ?ABKPRU 3F BR.AKUPs +84 184
#note O_O He doesn't know PRECITED.  Then again, if he knew the P-hook, he probably wouldn't have played RECITED where he did in the first place.

>Tasha: IIINRTU 11H INTI +10 214
#note I consider SUIT, and even exchanging again, but decided to dump both two I's and open another lane for mysel-Wallace.
>Wallace_Schultz: GINOSTU 10I OUTSING +70 392
#note This wouldn't be happening had I played SUIT.
>Tasha: AIORRUY O8 OR.Y +24 238
#note I mentally checked out here, but I immediately regretted not playing YUGA.
>Wallace_Schultz: EHLPW 7K WHELP +25 417
#note If he would have played this at 1D, I would have lost my cotton-picking mind.  Why couldn't I draw the P?  I would have made much better use of it.
>Tasha: AADDIRU 5D AD +15 253
#note Why didn't I just play DAD?

#note I'm trying to block an annoying X play.
>Wallace_Schultz: AERTX 12J EXTRA +37 512
#note But I forgot about TIX.
>Tasha: AADEGRS 8J RE +7 312
#note 14E SERA sims best, but shouldn't I be sticking Wallace with the J?  If that's the case, I like EON better.  I just didn't see it.

>Tasha: AADGS 10F .A +11 323
#note This is when I realized that I never stuck a player with a letter before in a tournament.  At least I don't think I have.  I was excited and hoping I don't mess up.  I did some calculations and realized that "slow playing" isn't the way to go.  It took me a minute or two, but I THINK I found the right endgame.  It's not hard, but I'm still going to give myself some credit for actually still caring enough to take the time to figure it out.  :D
