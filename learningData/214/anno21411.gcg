>Charles_Reinke: ?ELOPTY H2 PEYOTLs +80 80
>Matt_Canik: AEGITUY G1 GUY +24 24
>Charles_Reinke: DEGIIMR F3 DIRGE +18 98
#note Charles: Didn't see the point of keeping a bingo-prone leave here. I'm also mostly blocking easy row 8 bingos.
>Matt_Canik: AEIMNST 8A MANTISE. +88 112
#note Charles: "Mostly" blocking.
>Charles_Reinke: ADGIIIM C3 DIAMI. +20 118
>Matt_Canik: ?EEKVVZ B2 ZEK +41 153
>Charles_Reinke: AADGHIP B8 .PHAGIA +42 160
>Matt_Canik: ?EEIOVV 13A V.VE +20 173
#note Matt: LOVEVInE is 65, I didn't know it. OGIVE is probably better is too
>Charles_Reinke: ADENQTX 11A Q.NAT +28 188
>Matt_Canik: ?ADEIOR 12D RADIOEd +74 247
>Charles_Reinke: DEEJNOX 13H EXON +39 227
#note Charles: It probably doesn't make sense for me to open up an S hook with three unseen. 13G DEX performs better in the sim.
>Matt_Canik: ABRSSST D1 BASS +36 283
#note Matt: BASS? BAST? BASTS? I thought RST was solid here, but I have the last esses so holding two is pretty cool, especially with a spot like EXONS open. 
>Charles_Reinke: DEEEJNW 14J WEED +31 258
#note Charles: WEENED in the same spot is obviously much better. I wish I had seen it. Since I was pretty sure that Matt had another S, I played this so that he would use it on the N column while opening up another triple. The plan was to cash in on the new TWS while saving my N for dOW(N). However, I'm usually not going to come out ahead in such a sequence.
>Matt_Canik: IOORSTW N10 WORTS +50 333
#note Matt: In hindsight, this was a huge turn. If I play TROW at 15K, I kill all the lanes and set up a HUGE threat for me next turn. If I play this, I have opened a board that is otherwise dead. Is it ridiculous to pass 50 for 17 here?
>Charles_Reinke: ABEJLNN O7 JANE +38 296
#note Charles: Being able to play the J on the O column while saving an N was perfect.
>Matt_Canik: FHILOOU 15A OLIO +29 362
>Matt_Canik: FHILOOU --  -29 333
#note Matt: I had never seen APHAGIA before, but it certainly seemed like it took an S. On a turn with nothing else I saw, it seemed okay-ish to try. (T)UFOLI is a great option here, I think. 
>Charles_Reinke: ABILNOT 5H .BLATION +70 366
>Matt_Canik: FHILOOU L1 FLOU. +24 357
#note Matt: I am suddenly in a horrible position. I think FLOU(T) gives me the most chances to outrun him if he has a bad rack, plus holds the H to combine with the Cs I could draw for big scores. HUL(L)OO is another option. 
>Charles_Reinke: CEFNTUU 15H FUN +24 390
#note Charles: 12L CU(R)F is better. I don't need to cash in my N right now. If Matt has a big play down column M he could win.
>Matt_Canik: EHIILOR 1D .RI. +7 364
#note Matt: I think I'm sunk here, but Charles is low on time so I come up with a crafty ploy; I play this, sending the message that I was hoping to bingo, and then draw just one tile. I am hoping that tile is a C and I am able to surprise Charles with the surprise outplay of CHELOI(D) M8 for 48-and-out. Q says I also win 2/8 games with HO(L)IER or HI(L)LER.
>Charles_Reinke: CCERRTU 10D CURT +17 407
>Matt_Canik: EHILOO M9 HOLOI. +42 406
#note Charles: I have to let this go just in case it happens to be good ("adj. pertaining to holograms"?)

Matt: Charles has to let this go.
>Charles_Reinke: CER 3K C.RE +12 419
#note Charles: Missed that I gave myself a better out: 14D REC. I probably would have played this anyway since I wouldn't want to risk CARER being phony.
>Charles_Reinke:  (E) +2 421
