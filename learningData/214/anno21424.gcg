#note HOOD looks better defensively than the other options, but the board is still going to be wide open for a bingo almost no matter what I play

>Amalan_Iyengar: AEEGILM 14B MILEAGE +79 509
#note So before he played RITZ, I saw that I had MILEAGE in two spots. I also really really really had to go to the bathroom, and when he played RITZ, I threw down MILEAGE, assuming that RITZ blocked it. I didn't want to go to the bathroom right before I put down a bingo, because that might look suspicious. When I went to make my outplay, I saw that it actually played!
