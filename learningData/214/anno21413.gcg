>Jeff_Fiszbein: EHOR 8E HERO +14 14
>Reid: ABEEOTU 7B BEAUT +15 15
#note OBEAH at E4 is #1 (43.15%). OBE at 7E is #2 (41.98%). AUTO at 7D is #3 (41.78%). My play is #15 (40.43%). I had considered OBEAH but didn't like the leave or the positioning. I really wanted to get rid of the U. I think OBE is the best play here. This was a small mistake.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AIJL 7H JAIL +21 35
>Reid: CEFOOVW K4 FOW. +20 35
#note WOOF at 9H is #1 (40.15%). WOLF at K5 is #2 (39.6%). WOVE at 9H is #3 (39.5%). My play is #5 (38.78%). This is a small mistake. I agree w/ Quackle here. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AZ 8A ZA +37 72
>Reid: CEILMOV L1 COVE +34 69
#note My play is #3 (38.21%). #1 is MOVE (32.22%) and #2 is VICE (39.07%). This is a minor mistake, I doubt that there is a huge difference in the leaves. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEV 1L .AVE +27 99
>Reid: AEIIILM D4 ILI. +8 77
#note VICE from the previous play is looking much better now. AMIE and AMI at 9A are #1 (31.98Z%) and #2 (31.83%). My play is #3 (31.47%). I think my choice was better even though the top two plays score more. I really don't like II in my rack. I also like that it leaves the MILIA hook in the future. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEILSTU M4 DILUTES +67 166
#note DUELLIST at 5A scores 68, but I think Jeff made the best choice here. 
>Reid: AEEIMNR 9A AMIE +25 102
#note My play is #2 (13.05%). JOE at H7 is a surprising #1 (13.99%). AM at 9A is #3 912.57%). I disagree with Quackle here and think taking the points is worth it.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EINNPTU 10G PUNNIE.T +64 230
>Reid: ADELNOR 11C LADRONE +74 176
#note #1 play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: TUX C2 TUX +29 259
#note TUX at 8M scores 30, but Jeff may be smartly blocking lanes at this point. 
>Reid: BEIMORS 12A BIOME +37 213
#note BROME is #1 (13.17%). MIB at 12G is #3 (10.72%). My play is #2 (11.45%). I agree with Quackle here but it's not a big mistake.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GOY A12 .OGY +30 289
>Reid: ADDHKRS K9 D.RK +18 231
#note Wasn't sure about this one, but it's #1.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ??AIORT 13C TAbORIn +76 365
#note TABORIN is #3. YAKITORI for the triple takes the top two spots. 
>Reid: ADEHRSS 14H DASHERS +80 311
#note #1 play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: G I13 ..G +3 368
#note This was the safe choice.
>Reid: GOQRSTY 12J S.RY +22 333
#note STOGY and STROY at 2B are #1(3.33%) and #2 (2.93%). STY at 14D is #3 (2.42%). I like STY. I considered STROY but didn't want to take out the last bingo lane and give opp a triple. My play is #5 (0.67%). While the Q likely kills me here, I think my play is a medium sized mistake. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EF 15K EF +23 391
>Reid: EGOPQTW 15N OW +17 350
#note TOPE at N5 is #1. POW at 6I is #2. PE at B1 is #3.  My play is not in the top 15 according to 5 min champ player. My play is #6 based on valuations of all plays
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ACINNN 5D .INN +8 399
#note CANINE at I6 and ANIONIC at 5H are some nice plays here. I think Jeff just wants a two and out here. 
>Reid: EGPQT M12 .E. +12 362
#note PE at B1 is #1. PET and GET are next at 2A. My play is sloppy here. My play is #16 based valuations of all plays.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ACN B1 CAN +16 415
>Jeff_Fiszbein:  (GPQT) +32 447
#note No missed bingos here. 9 of my 12 plays were in the top 5. Other than some sloppy end game, I really didn't make any major mistakes here. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game. I don't think this game was winnable.
