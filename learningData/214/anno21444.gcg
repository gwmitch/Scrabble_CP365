#note I'm accidently setting up my S.  After the game, Joe made a comment about the S setup.  I told him I didn't even notice the spot until a turn later.

#note I always mess plays like this up, but I think I got it right this time.  I wanted to take out the scoring spot, but I also wanted to preserve a vowel so I eliminated plays like 13A PIC.  Somewhere along the way, I suddenly notice the bingo lane I accidently created and so I decide to make a fishy play.  I hope I don't draw two O's.  Joe said he read me as having IN for a bingo to the G but I didn't even notice the G.  I was focused on row 3.

#note The first thing I saw was PORNIES*.  But then I remembered that ORPINES doesn't have an anagram.  The second thing I noticed was INCORPSE and I laid down I-N.....and THEN I notice the G.
