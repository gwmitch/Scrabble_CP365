#note #1 play. I was waiting on the letter I and my prayers were answered. 
>Jon_Shreve: ABO D10 ABO +28 60
>Reid: EIINOOR 7G OI +9 85
#note OORIE at F2 or D2 are #1 (56.23%) and #2 (55.57%). OROIDE at H4 is #3 (54.32%). My play is #5 (53.92%). In hindsight, this is a medium size mistake, but at least the tile fairy thinks it's funny. Quackle thinks tile turnover is important here. I didn't think IRONE was too bad a leave. I agree with Quackle here.
>Jon_Shreve: AEV C11 AVE +26 86
>Reid: EEINOOR 6D O.E +5 90
#note Well, at least I consistently make the same mistake. OORIE at F2 is #1 still (48.53%). OORIE at D2 is #3 (46.90%). OROIDE at H4 is #2 now (46.98%). My play is #4 (46.89%). The mistake is smaller now though. 
>Jon_Shreve: EGMMY C3 GEMMY +40 126
>Reid: DEILNOR D2 NOD +17 107
#note All my early momentum has vanished. The last two choices have been relatively small mistakes but have been amplified. Missing OORIE is turning out to be a big issue. OLIO at D3 is #1 (37.89%). LOO at D4 is #2 (37.34%) and RODEO at D2 is #3 (35.80%). My play is #11 (34.32%). I agree with Quackle here. OLIO is a great play. Another suboptimal choice by me.
>Jon_Shreve: FGU 6H FUG +18 144
>Reid: AEIIJLR B2 JAR +28 135
#note AJI at 5J or B7 or B13 are the top 3 (32.74%, 31.16%, 30.16%). I really didn't like keeping both of my I here. I didn't see AJI. I considered GOJI, JIG, and REJIG. Quackle is spot on here. My play is #5 (28.36%). Another medium sized mistake. 
>Jon_Shreve: OPTTU K5 PUTTO +22 166
#note Nice hook here.
>Reid: EEIILLT A4 ILLITE +27 162
#note #1 play. 
>Jon_Shreve: EHINO 8J E.HION +39 205
>Reid: ADEGIXY 1A GAY +32 194
#note #1 play here along with YAG.
>Jon_Shreve: IRU 5K .URI +6 211
>Reid: DEEIKTX L8 .IKED +28 222
#note I considered HEXED at L8 #2 (45.28%) but didn't want to play both E. I missed the beautiful TEXT at 7K #1 (54.53%). My play is #3 (44.60%). Missing TEXT is a big mistake.
>Jon_Shreve: AACELNR 12G CALEN.AR +62 273
>Reid: CEEFSTX M11 F.X +31 253
#note I saw EXSECT in my rack but failed to even think about hooking CALENDAR. It is #2 (41.91%). The beautiful COEXERTS at N7 is #1 (45.10%). EXECS at O1 is #3 (31.50%). I wasn't thinking about using my ess here but, for the opportunities that were available, this was a huge mistake. My play is not even in top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #6 based on valuations of all plays.
>Jon_Shreve: AIL 10C L..IA +16 289
>Reid: CDEESTT O12 SECT +34 287
#note #1 play here. I had to open. My rack was finally ready to dance and there was no place to do so. 
>Jon_Shreve: ??NOQTU 15H QUOTieN. +95 384
>Reid: ADEENTW 14J WEN +30 317
#note TWEEN and DAWEN at O1 are #1 and #2. I completely missed the PURI hook. I failed to properly consider the blanks and played NI. Fortunately, Jon missed it too. WET, which is what I should have played if I had paid more attention, is #3. It would be the number 1 play if it was valid. 
>Jon_Shreve: EIPRRSS C9 S....R +10 394
#note Jon is focused on two and out here. 
>Reid: ADETZ J10 ZE. +32 349
#note EDIT at N3 is #1 to block Jon's out. I wasn't really paying attention here to the out. TE at 6N and ZIT at N4 are #2 and #3. My play is #6. Assuming optimal play from here by both players, playing EDIT reduces spread to 69. Playing TE reduces spread to 72. ZIT reduces spread to 77. 
>Jon_Shreve: EIPRS O1 PRIES +31 425
>Jon_Shreve:  (ADT) +8 433
#note This game was incorrectly scored officially as 433-348. No missed bingos here.  8 of my 12 plays were in the top 5. 9 in the top 10. There were some different choices early on that could have changed things w/ turnover. Missing AJI and TEXT made things tougher later. Missing EXSECT also increased spread. Playing an invalid word is rarely a good idea. This game might have been winnable if I had pulled a blank earlier. Overal, I give myself a C this game. C+ at best. Initially, I blamed this loss on the tiles.
