#note Exchanging D is #1 (55.02%). AD at 8H is #2 (53.58). DA at 8G is #3 (53.47%). I disagree with Quackle here even though the leave is strong. My play is #4 (52.92%). This is a minor mistake if at all.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?EEMNOR -  +0 0
#note Terry held for around 5 minutes and then finally challenged and lost. I particularly chose this word because I figured it might be challenged. Too bad it didn't make a difference in the game.
>Reid: AACGGNT G3 TANGA +21 45
#note GANG at G3 is #1 (63.64%). GAG at I3 and GAG at I8 are #2 (61.80%) and #3 (61.57%). My play is #8 (60.69%). This is just a small mistake. I liked my play here even though the leave is horrible. I agree w/ Quackle that CANT and ACT are better leaves.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?EEMNOR 10B MOREENs +75 75
#note NANOMETRE at 5G was playable. Also PROMENADE at 7A. Her play is best.
>Reid: CDGKOPQ E6 POCK.D +30 75
#note #1 play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: OW 9C WO. +25 100
>Reid: BGLLQSW -GLQW +0 75
#note Exchanging all but S is #1 (33.80%). Keeping LS is #2 (33.02%). My choice is #3 (32.49%). Not really a mistake here. I made the right choice to exchange.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AEEELOZ -AEEEL +0 100
>Reid: BEEGLNS F2 BEG +20 95
#note #1 play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EHH I3 HEH +26 126
>Reid: AELNOSS C9 ..OLS +16 111
#note SEA and SEAL at F9 are #1 (41.3%) and #2 (41.18%). ON at I7 and SAGAMEN at 4D are tied for #3 (40.58%). Looks to me like Quackle is as confused as me about what do do here. My play is #4 (40.39%). No mistake here.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ALS F9 S.AL +18 144
>Reid: AENSTVY 12F .EVY +14 125
#note HEAVY at 3I is #1 (42.56%) and a great play i mised. NAY at J2 is #2 (41.39%). MY is a surprising #3 (39.48%). My play is #4 (39.47%). This is a minor mistake. My opponent has several playable bingos.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EINORST 13I OESTRIN +72 216
>Reid: AEINSTX K6 SEXTAIN. +80 205
#note #1 play.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ACDEELO M6 COLEADE. +63 279
#note This play was the beginning of the end.
>Reid: IQRRTUU O11 RU. +4 209
#note On the bright side, at least I got a U to go with the Q this time. Quackle is as vexed by this rack as I am. RUT at 14H is #1 (8.81%). QUIP at 6B is #2 (7.75%) and OUR at 7M is #3 (6.69%). RUT seems like playing a game of chicken, opening another triple bingo lane. QUIP is valued because of points, but is risky and I didn't have an E to take advantage. OUR seems a bit silly but it does make a triple triple less likely. I thought had made a huge mistake here, but, suprirsingly, my play is #15 (4.22%). This is not a huge mistake. I wanted to better utilize the Q while dumping my doubles. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: OY N10 YO +30 309
>Reid: BEIQRTU 6B QUI. +35 244
#note #1 play here. While I knew it was risky, there were only two E unaccounted for, so I thought it was a good risk for the current points and the potential points. I was wrong. BRIQUET at 3A is #2.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EINZ A5 ZEIN +55 364
#note Because of course.
>Reid: ABEEPRT J7 REAP +35 279
#note AB at J9 is #1 (1.17%). BEAT and BEEP at J7 are #2 (1.07%) and #3 (1.00%). I saw BEEP but didn't want to use both of my E in case I might get the blank and have a chance for a bingo. My play is #5 (0.90%). This is a minor mistake and I'm okay with my play here. The chances of winning are extremely small. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: GV C5 G.V +11 375
>Reid: ?BEIITU 8M .IB +15 294
#note TUI at J1 is #1 (7.27%). Exchanging BIITU is #2 (4.33%). TUB at L13 is #3 (3.83%). My play is tied for #10 (1.5%). I will admit that Quackle's choices dont seem as crazy as they usually do in this situation. TUI creates volatility and forces Terry to address it. I like TUB. I probably made a small mistake here. I was just trying to score while keeping column L lane and row 14 lane open. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: IJT 12A JI.T +38 413
>Reid: ?EIIRTU A12 .UTE +33 327
#note TUI at J1 is resounding #1 (24.87%). Apparently, opening a triple triple lane never gets blocked in Quackle land. TUI at L13 is #2 (4.73%) and ETUI at L12 is #3 (3.17%). I took the points. My play is tied for #6 with no chance of winning.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: FF 15A .FF +9 422
>Reid: ?AIILOR J1 LIAR +19 346
#note I missed the #1 play EFFIGIAL at 15A based on valuations for 5 min champ. LIARD and LAIRD at 14E are tied for #2. AiR at J2 is #3. My play is #3 based on valuations of all plays. No home for my bingo. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: DRTUW 14H WUD +24 446
>Reid: ?IO 1H OI.s +9 355
#note BIO at 15F is #1. OILS is tied for #4 with many other words based on valuations of all plays. This was a poor play but it obviously didn't make a difference. 
>Reid:  (RT) +4 359
#note This game was scored incorrectly as 445-349. No missed bingos. 9 of 15 plays in the top 4. 12 of 15 plays in the top 10. There was some suboptimal play near the end, but overall I think this game was unwinnable. My draw after Terry played her last bingo did not allow me to catch up and took a while to recover from. I give myself an A- for this game. B+ at the very worst.
