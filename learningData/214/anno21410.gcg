#note With the rack knowledge, Q says I am supposed to play PIX here and avoid JAB for a bunch

>Matt_Canik: BDIPRSZ K3 BIRDS +29 55
#note I don't want to give Siri easy plays next turn, so I decide not to play ZIPS.

>Matt_Canik: MNPSTUZ M5 PUTZ +21 76
#note And now I don't know what to do again! This gives him the easy points, but can I *really* play TUMP for 14??? Q says yes, I should!

>Matt_Canik: DEFIMSU C9 F.U +10 197
#note Probably too volatile a play against the opposition, but it *really* limits his options while keeping the D hook for me. MUDFI(SH) and MUF(TI) are way better. MEDIUS O1 is also nice. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EILO E7 OLI.E +16 236
>Matt_Canik: CDEIMNS 12A CEDIS +39 236
#note MINCES O1 is better, I got obsessed with the hook I had set up.

#note I wanted to keep the D for NOD, kept a second consonant because the unseen pool is 17V : 17C

#note Spent a loooong time here. QUAIS/WILDS or Q?????S/UMS plays are scaaaary, but I don't think it's too likely he has one after his last play. I'm very worried about drawing the Q myself - this play allows me to play QuO(L)L next turn if that happens, with a very small chance it gets blocked. I can outrun the SUQ/SON play this opens up because Siri probably can't go out in one after those. QUE(L)L or QUI(L)T are other options, as is NOO

#note (H)AE/EAU/FEUDED is pretty. REL(E)t also is good, but this wins also.
