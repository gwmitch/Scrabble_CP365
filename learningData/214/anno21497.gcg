>Avery: ACLNSTV D8 C.NTAL +22 92
#note Maybe too desperate, but I had to hope I could cash in the A hook if she didn't know it. She didn't, but I never had a good chance to take it. It also takes an S, since it's a noun!

#note OVA maybe now, but since I'm keeping an A, I think it's ok to hold off

#note No clue what to do here. I was so paranoid about the two X spots that I took the higher scoring one and had to hope I could draw a remaining A to take the hook or take columns K or L. A sim has a lot of choices close to each other.

#note I think I have to block here regardless
>Leesa: ?AINOSU M9 A. +3 404
#note Leesa has no winning plays here. L8 ONRUSH values the highest since I have to find and play VARIX to win. EXILER loses by 1!

>Leesa: ?INOSU M13 SUN +19 423
#note Leesa has lots of plays here that win actually, but she was very low on time.
