>Magra: ?ADOTTU 8B OUTDATe +66 66
#note this ended up being a really cool game so sam gave me his racks afterwards. It might be better to play this at 8D to make opening 7s harder for him to play.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AABCLNX 9F LAX +24 24
#note I'd say COAX because the B and the C don't get along too well.
>Magra: AEFFORS D1 AFFORES. +80 146
>Sam_Kantimathi: ABCHINZ 2B HA.IZ +80 104
>Magra: ACIIMOY 1A MAY. +37 183
#note I saw COIF but didn't think it would be competitive. it turns out to sim just about even.
>Sam_Kantimathi: BCNNRRT 6B BR.NT +15 119
#note BRONC looks better
>Magra: CGIIMNO 3A MI +10 193
#note tough play, this. I spent a long time thinking. I ended up fishing for a play that's not a word: EXOGENIC*. ENDOGENIC is good. I think I would've gotten away with it. There are 11 Es which puts my chances of drawing the play at 1/3 or so while keeping an OK leave. I saw ZIG which quackle likes better. did not see CIMEX and AFFORESTING which all sim about even.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ACILNRY C8 .RANYLIC +78 197
#note nice find
>Magra: CGIINOT H8 ..CITING +54 247
#note dear god, I actually just missed NOTICING. eek. I even looked around for a while first.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ADIKLOR I2 KILORAD +73 270
>Magra: EHNOSTU 15E TOU.HENS +63 310
#note this is a good old-fashioned shootout shaping up here.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ADEEIRW 14J WEIRD +51 321
#note it's sam's turn to miss a bingo...he thought WAITERED was collins because that's what he's been studying. turns out WAITRESSED is good in ours too.
>Magra: EGIQSUV M9 QUIVE. +56 366
#note the miss ended up making a huge difference, because I wouldn't have had this play or my backup play of SUQ.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ADEEENS 8M ANE +28 349
#note really interesting and tough play. with an A in hand it's tempting to make a play that keeps it. Quackle suggests the nonintuitive EASE at O12 or KEENED up top saving the A, better by a couple of points. this is definitely a competitive option though.
>Magra: BEEGIOS 4G OB.IGEES +78 444
#note this has to seal the deal, right?
>Sam_Kantimathi: DEEERSW 2H S.EWERED +86 435
#note sweet find to put the game up for grabs
>Magra: ?AEEGOO 1N OE +17 461
#note what an interesting position to be in. I thought I analyzed this just right when I made my play. my play keeps a big play on the O column no matter what I draw. If I draw a V I play VASE. If I draw the P I play something. I have a guaranteed 42 if I draw the J (JOYs) and maybe better. The only two good plays I could see were PIVOT at 13G or JAUNT at 10B, and I can beat either of those. The only problem: I totally forgot about WEIRDO...I get the feeling just GOO/WEIRDO is the play if I see it. I'd be curious what other people think. 
>Sam_Kantimathi: LNOPPUV O12 PLOP +43 478
#note I was pretty much just shocked when he threw this down. Fortunately my draw is benevolent. If he had the J as well I may be screwed...
>Magra: ?AEGJOT 12A JA.GEe +48 509
#note interestingly, given my play of OE if the last two tiles in the bag are NV I lose to the sequence JALOP and then TUP.
>Sam_Kantimathi: NUV 10B V.U +14 492
>Magra: OT 1G TO +12 521
>Magra:  (N) +2 523
#note what a fun game. It wasn't perfect but at this stage in the tournament it was unexpectedly cool to have a barnburner.
