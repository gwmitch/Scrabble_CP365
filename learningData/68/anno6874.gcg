#note ooh. it's funny how the brain works. during this game, i had a very tough time deciding between this and wagon. as soon as i view it with a clear head, before simming, it is clear AVOW will sim much better. so while playing, my brain makes bad decisions.

#note lame. i should write down plays when i think of them. i forgot that i thought of ALODIUm. -1

#note shoulda just gone with my first instinct of 2E AH. also saw 3H GHEE. -2

#note D12 ELHI -3 (i think i need to keep that part of the board open, though).

#note interesting situation here. 13B DERAIL scores the most and has the highest "valuation" but it's not winninger than other plays. good learning experience in not always taking the highest scoring play, as tempting as it is right now. quackle likes F12 KID for some reason. 5G DERAT maybe too.

#note !

#note this time, it's just too difficult to pass up 50 points. also, he has the F.

#note another T, dammit!

>Me: ERRTTWZ G8 .ERT +12 276
#note i'm not going to call this a genius play or anything close to it. i'm also not throwing in the Z, keeping ERT. this is my only chance to win the game now. -5

>Me: AEORTWZ H11 AZOTE +74 350
#note victor had a very funny reaction to this. seriously, what a draw though.
>victor: CGNPSUV 6L PUG +15 368
>Me: ACHNRRW I10 CRAW +36 386
#note this game is unwinnable, but i had to hope he didn't see ENDIVES. THRAWN, which sims highest, just throws in the towel and ends the game. my move gives me a chance to win.
>victor: DEINSV J12 SNID +25 393
>victor: DEINSV --  -25 368
#note !
>Me: HNR 15H .H +5 391
#note ok, now it's my turn to freak out. i had no time here, i didn't want to chance another opportunity at him finding ENDIVES, and i wasn't 100% on HONER. so blocking endives. but ERN is a much better way obviously! just no time to make a rational decision.... -17 (costing me the game)
>victor: DEINSV N6 .IN +4 372
#note his only win is M6 US.
