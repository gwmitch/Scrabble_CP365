#note I would usually play PIG but wasn't sure if DATE was a good enough leave. turns out it is.

#note playing it up top takes out the S hook, but it turns out that it makes no more than 1 point of difference.

#note didn't think of MYRTLE. this is still better. considered fishing with MEL but this about 5 better. 
>Rachel_Knapp: EHO E10 HOE +23 125
>Magra: FIILNST E2 LIFT +23 124
#note thought about this for a long time. Decided that ILNST wasn't good enough and that ILNT seemed unlikely to score much. very close on the sim.

#note lucky me again. I spent a long, long time on this play, but I didn't really think about not bingoing. I probably should've given all the pretty lanes this gives her to work with. quackle suggests fishing AA or AE or maybe playing ANSAE or AIS at F10. my play doubles her chances of bingoing from 10 to 20%.
>Rachel_Knapp: EGIMRU H8 ..MIURGE +39 280
#note she's a good player.
>Magra: DEFLOOQ J6 FOO.LED +20 374
#note all of a sudden I kinda have problems. the blank is out and she could easily score a bunch with the X, giving her a clear channel toward winning the game. Playing the Q doesn't make sense, I think. I settled on this over FLOODS because it blocks more and plays through an extra tile. however, REFLOOD is just about the same but scores more.
>Rachel_Knapp: DELNNOX 3K LEX +46 326
#note she has one of the danger tiles
>Magra: INNOQTY N8 Q.T +14 388
#note what an insane position! all of a sudden, I am completely screwed. I have about 3 minutes and as I go through the combinations it seems like she has a bingo no matter what play I throw down. for spread purposes I throw this down to block the highest scoring bingos and set up a play for myself...
>Rachel_Knapp: ADENORW O10 ONWARD +44 370
#note unbelievably the ? is in the bag. I escape with a win. note that if FOOTLED weren't there NARROWED would've gone down. It also turns out my last play is wrong - if the R is in the bag, then her rack of ADENOW? can't bingo if I block the E and G by playing YOGIN or TONY. Under time pressure I found a reasonable but inferior option.
