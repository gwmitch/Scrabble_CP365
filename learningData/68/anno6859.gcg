>Ross: GINNTTU H7 NUT +6 6
#note -he told me he passed on NUTTING (wasn't sure)
>Jeremy: GIIKNRS 10F RISKING +70 70
#note 10E GRISKIN -0.5 / I forgot there was an anagram here.
>Ross: EIJV F6 JIVE. +31 37
>Jeremy: AADDORW K9 O.WARD +20 90
#note -4.1 11I ADO.  I don't like hanging on to the W, but this play cost me large.
>Ross: ?DEENST 15I DESTiNE +85 122
>Jeremy: AADFIOP E10 FADO +32 122
>Ross: CDEEPRS 12G RESP.CED +78 200
>Jeremy: AILLOPT D11 PILOT +28 150
#note I need a G to start with for GALLIPOT.
>Ross: EIX 15A EXI. +33 233
>Jeremy: AEILLVZ N8 LAZE. +35 185
#note -11.0 B13 ZA(X).  Strongly considered ZAX, but this creates two spaces to score, and I'm down.
>Ross: UU 8M U.U +9 242
#note I don't mind this play at all.  Gives me a bingo lane and doesn't score at all.
>Jeremy: ABILMUV 14B AB. +32 217
#note Even though the leave is tantamount to shit on a stick, that spot can't be left open for an easy 30.  Quackle agrees. 7K IAMB was close behind.
>Ross: OY 14N OY +19 261
>Jeremy: BILMOUV 7K VUM +18 235
#note -11.3 7K LIMB.  I'm keeping the O for OVUM.
>Ross: EOW J6 WOE +23 284
>Jeremy: BIIILOO -BIIILOO +0 235
#note I didn't just draw that did I?  I traded all 7. Quackle agrees.
>Ross: G 12C G.. +5 289
#note showing off a bingo prone leave, makes opening the board a bit risky even though I have to do it.
>Jeremy: EEGNRRT 13A ER +12 247
#note -3.8 K5 RE(V).  My play scores less, and is more aggressive with bingo hunting.
>Ross: AH O10 AH +21 310
>Jeremy: EGNRTTY M11 Y.T +21 268
#note -2.8 A8 GYREN(E).  Quackle puts my move with the highest win percent though.
>Ross: AACFR A8 CARAF. +45 355
>Jeremy: AEGLNRT K3 GANE. +23 291
#note -2.9 K5 LE(V).  That ain't gonna win.  9A (A)L - the other suggested better play, will get shut down too.  I think this is the play.
>Ross: ?EILOST L3 OI +11 366
>Jeremy: AELLQRT M2 QAT +35 326
#note -6.6 M1 QAT.  The wpct move is Exch. LQ which I considered, but a win would be a miracle at this point.
>Ross: BIT N1 BIT +37 403
>Jeremy: EHILLMR 7E L.M. +9 335
#note considered 9A AH going for S or blank with MILLERS, but I get hit with TOONIES if I do that.  Tried some other one tile fishes, but couldn't come up with a win.  Ended up blocking G1 oppo bingos like TEnSION which are quite possibly about to happen.  This is best.
>Ross: ?EINOOS O1 OS +30 433
#note Quackle says I9 O(K)E(S) for Ross. -12
>Jeremy: EHILNR 13I HE. +23 358
#note -3 14H HER(D) - low on time. Total 46 equity loss.
>Ross: ?EINO I2 mONIE +11 444
>Ross:  (ILNR) +8 452
