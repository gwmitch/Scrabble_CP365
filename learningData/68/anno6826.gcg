#note Uh...yuck.  Where do you even begin to clean this up?  QUackle doesn't like this at all, preferring I7 TAJ, G7 TAJ, and G8 AVOW. I felt that I had to unload at least one of the V or W and that the T's could wait a turn.  Then again, maybe this game would have turned out quite differently had I played G7 TAJ, which narrowly wins the sim.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?AEEHSW G7 HEEhAWS +79 89
#note Nice find.  And if I play TAJ on the last turn, what does she do with this rack?  Now I'm in trouble.
>Jim_Burlant: ASTTVYZ F6 TAV +20 41
#note VAT in the same location scores 3 more and opens up a hook for my S - don't know how I missed it.   And it wins the sim.  F6 ZA scores 37...but it just doesn't score enough points to justify the 5-consonant leave.
>Cheryl_Tyler: DEIIX 13B DEIXI. +28 117
>Jim_Burlant: IOSSTYZ D12 S.ZY +40 81
#note Best play, the sim winner.  11B ZOYSIA 36 also worth consideration.  I'm winning 28%.
>Cheryl_Tyler: CEOR B10 CRE.O +28 145
>Jim_Burlant: AIIIOST 4I .IAO +22 103
#note The sim winner, with J3 IOTA a close second - I'd rather keep my T if I have to keep 2 I's.
>Cheryl_Tyler: DRY 5K DRY +22 167
>Jim_Burlant: IINORST E11 NI. +22 125
#note 14D ZIT and ZIn sim just about interchangeably as the sim winners.  This choice sims roughly 3 points down.  I didn't notice the X underlap until later in the game.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EFLU E3 FLUE +16 183
>Jim_Burlant: AIMORST J6 AMORIST +71 196
#note The only playable bingo, and I'm back to 46% winning chances.
>Cheryl_Tyler: DEPQU 10I P.QUED +22 205
>Jim_Burlant: INNNOOU 11J .IN +30 226
#note Didn't see 12G WONTON, which is best.  Despite scoring 30 to WONTON's 20, this choice sims second, roughly 4 points down.  I figured that, in the absence of an N to play through for NONUNION, just try to score, stay in the game, and see if I could turn the remainder of the rack on the next turn.   WONTON wins 40%, and this choice wins 38.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AELP D1 PLEA +27 232
>Jim_Burlant: NNOOSTU 3L NOUN +11 237
#note I couldn't think of PUTON or PUNTO, and all I could see was POUTS and I didn't want to burn the S. I figured that I might as well throw caution to the wind and open another line.  But given her next rack it wouldn't have mattered a whole lot even if I took out 1H with PUTON.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?ADEIOR 1D .ARODIEs +80 312
#note And if I play PUTON on the previous turn, she still has ROADSIDE down the N column on this turn.
>Jim_Burlant: EGHOSTV 2I THO +30 267
#note Anyway - this sims with the highest valuation and comes in a close second in win percentage.  I figured that I would force her to defend O1.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ACT O1 CA.T +21 333
>Jim_Burlant: EEGGLSV 15D .EGGS +30 297
#note Didn't see M9 VEGES, which would have helped my end game prospects quite considerably, but this game is over except for the final spread.
>Cheryl_Tyler: KNRU N10 .RUNK +20 353
>Jim_Burlant: ELLMORV A14 LO +8 305
#note Hoping upon hope that AI are in the bag and I can play MAIL O12 for a late spread reducer.
>Cheryl_Tyler: BIT 3C B..IT +22 375
>Jim_Burlant: EELMNRV 14K LEE. +8 313
#note Having watched yet another game unravel for what felt like the umpteenth time this tournament, at this point I stopped caring and just moved tiles to end the game ASAP. REVEL D6 is clearly my best play.
