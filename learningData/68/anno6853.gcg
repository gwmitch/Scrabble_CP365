>dacrON: ?EEEILR 11H .ELERIEs +68 162
#note ...so whoa that I sat back down and promptly overdrew. I was very scared I'd lose the blank, but I was happy when he turned over EEI. I had 4(!) Es, so his throwing an E back in was excellent for me.

#note Didn't think this was good when I played it (not # either). Usually when you have no memory of a top 3k 7 or 8, it's because it isn't good. Yet I played it anyway. Deal-sealer.

#note wasn't sure enough on UN(B)I(D). And seriously, this play has nothing to do with GANJAH BOOZEs and QAT being on the board...I PROMISE.
