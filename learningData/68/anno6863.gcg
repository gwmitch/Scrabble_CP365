>Sam: AGLOP 8H GALOP +22 22
>Joey: DEGHIIO 9G DOGIE +23 23
#note HIDE I9 was intriguing, since it gave me a shot at GALOPING.  I decided against that because it would probably get blocked too often.
>Sam: AHW 7G HAW +32 54
>Joey: EEHINSU 7K HUE +17 40
>Sam: JO 6F JO +30 84
>Joey: AEILNSW N1 LAWINES +81 121
>Sam: BLO 1L BO.L +27 111
>Joey: AINRTVY 2I VINY +19 140
#note No idea what's right here.  This seemed fine, but I wasn't crazy about it.
>Sam: ELNOR 10I ENROL +27 138
>Joey: AINRTTT 11G TART +17 157
>Sam: BDEIRS 12D REBIDS +39 177
>Joey: EFINTUY M9 F.UTY +30 187
>Sam: ADIPR 5G PADRI +24 201
>Joey: CEINNQU E7 QUINC. +34 221
#note QUIN 4L was another option.  Little did I realize that I would be blocking my own bingo.
>Sam: X 8D X. +17 218
>Joey: CEEFNOR O3 EF +23 244
>Sam: AK 4H KA +25 243
>Joey: ACENORT 3E ARCO +16 260
#note Either I play here or open up a second spot, hoping to get the last bingo.  Tough choice.
>Sam: S K7 ....S +26 269
>Joey: EEIMNTT D1 MINT +25 285
#note Didn't seem too crazy to put an M in this position, even with Sam seemingly close to a bingo.
>Sam: AEINRST 1A RAI.ENTS +140 409
#note Well, I guess it was crazy.
>Joey: EEIOTVZ H11 ..OZE +45 330
>Sam: ?ADEEMO A1 .EMOlADE +83 492
#note No matter what Sam had, I knew this bingo was coming.
>Joey: EEGITUV J1 G.VE. +16 346
#note GEEZ 14E is actually slightly better because it blocks his best out play.
>Sam: ? E7 ......s +17 509
#note Good game, Sam.  Not as good as last year's game, though.  :)
>Sam:  (EITU) +8 517
