#note  THY 8G is clearly best; don't know how I missed it.  But this did work out.
>Laurie_Cohen: AGIOTU 8C AGOUTI +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: EHINSTZ I2 ZENITHS +82 82
#note Well, I got away with one, didn't I?  This is best, with nothing else simming within 10 points.
>Laurie_Cohen: MOY 9C YOM +28 46
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIRTU 2H A.URITEs +86 168
#note Luckbox!   Prior to Laurie's play of YOM blocking the 2x2 of sATU(O)IRE that I was going to put down, I was willing to trade 4 points on the scoreboard for the safer sAUT(O)IRE.  However, with the choices away from row 2 not even scoring 70 to this play's 86, it was obvious that I had to play on row 2.  I did not know LAZURITE, which wins the sim by roughly 2 points.  Laurie's next play makes it clear why LAZURITE is better.
>Laurie_Cohen: EJNOT 1D JETON +66 112
>Jim_Burlant: CDGILNR 5G CL.NG +16 184
#note Fail.  Didn't know most of the choices here and didn't think that I should turn the rack for 24.; 5E DIRLING (which I didn't know) and G1 OLD (which I didn't know the hook to make) are the winners.  This play - yuck. Of plays I know, DICING L1 is a decent alternative, saw GOLDING but wasn't sure about it.
>Laurie_Cohen: ACINORV N1 V.RONICA +65 177
#note Laurie is back in the game, but the sim says her winning chances are barely 30%.
>Jim_Burlant: BDIORVY O8 YOB +39 223
#note Another horrendous miss.  BOVID wins, with IVORY a 7-point runner up.  Either of those is much better.  I was too brain-locked by the collection of counters.
>Laurie_Cohen: BFF L1 B.FF +30 207
>Jim_Burlant: ADIRRVX M2 .AR +24 247
#note Cute play, but Quackle prefers M4 RAX, D4 VIRAGO, and 7C RAD.
>Laurie_Cohen: EHT 7C HET +32 239
>Jim_Burlant: DIRSSVX 11L VIDS +17 264
#note Finally, a good play.  This is best - nothing else sims within 5 points  - and I'm winning 61%.
>Laurie_Cohen: DOOP 2B POOD +26 265
>Jim_Burlant: AAINRSX 3B AX +40 304
#note The only other play I seriously considered was RAX 3A; I didn't look for Quackle's preference, L11 VARIX,w hich narrowly wins the sim after 1100 iterations.  I saw AX for 40 keeping AINRS and with that open T at G8, that was enough for me.    All three of these choices (VARIX, AX, RAX) sim within 2 points of each other, and nothing else sims within 5 points of them.As dangerous as I felt this hook was, the deciding factor for me was that I wanted to keep AINRS together, especially with that open T sitting at G9.  
>Laurie_Cohen: AEENPT A3 PENATE +39 304
#note Arrgh!  I know the bingo PENATES, so it stood to reason that it was acceptable as a 6 without an S.  Joke's on me!  I had no idea this was phony.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGINRS 10D SEARING +75 379
#note It doesn't get luckier than fishing EG to AINRS.  Any number of bingos play here at 10D and 10E, but this is the best one.  I'm winning 89%.
>Laurie_Cohen: AEEW L8 WEA.E +30 334
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIRRU 13L DUI +21 400
#note First off, I think we can ignore the sim here, as it prefers 13I DURRIE for the points - why give her an easy place to hook any number of bingos ending in E for 70+?  I 'd rather take out the easy hooks.  While a 13-L play was definitely the right call to take away the easy backhooks to weave, this play was the right idea with the wrong execution.  Given that Q is unseen, I really need to hold onto that U.  DIRE 13L probably should have been my choice. This choice is not smart, given the tile pool and the Q-unfriendliness of this board.


>Laurie_Cohen: KL H10 .LK +12 346
>Jim_Burlant: EIMQRRW 12F IR. +7 407
#note Tough options here, made so in no small part because of my foolishly playing the U on the previous turn; if I made the right play on the last turn, I'd have a no-brainer play of QUIRK that would kill her chances.  I felt that any scoring plays had to be put on hold while I blocked a potential bingo of ISOLEAD making ISOLEAD/ILKA.  Complicating this position for me was the fact that I didn't know any of the bingos ending in OSE in this tile pool, so as far as I was concerned I had successfully blocked with this play.  If I had known I had no block for any of the bingos in that pool, I would have done what Quackle suggests here: play for equity with SEW O2 for 30.
>Laurie_Cohen: ?AELLOS 13A cALLOSE +69 415
>Jim_Burlant: DEEMQRW 6M Q. +11 418
#note Lucky for me, the draw bails me out of the last 2 misfires.  Now that she can't go out, get rid of the Q.
>Laurie_Cohen: IU 7I .I +5 420
#note a little surprised she didn't hinder my row 14 plays with REI.  Having said that, I still win with practically any play I put down even if she blocks it (DREAM B10, MIRED 14F, etc.).
