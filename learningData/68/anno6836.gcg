#note this is round 29.  i'm in 2nd place, down 2.5 games with 3 to go, and i'm matched against richard in king of the hill.  if i beat him i keep playing him, and if i win all 3 i win the division.  let's do it.

#note F&%$
>Mike_Lean: EILRTUX M3 T.LEX +40 68
#note gj missing redux, would have probably changed the game.  oh well, at least this doesn't give him an easy 40 on the triple lane.

#note unveil 10B would have been sexy.  i'll take this over ovule M10 which quackle said was better, because to me it looks like he has an S and is fishing.

#note very slightly worse than nubia, which i'm not 100% sure i knew
>Richard_Spence: ADRT F2 RAT.D +12 242
#note making it very clear he's trying to block every bingo lane for me
>Mike_Lean: AEEINOT D9 O.INE +16 195
#note even though this didn't sim best, i thought this play was awesome.  i'm down 60 and it opens up 2 bingo lanes for me, since it's safe to assume he's going to do his damn best to close up anything i open.
>Richard_Spence: AO 6E O.A +15 257
#note expert.
>Mike_Lean: ?AEEINT C3 ETEsIAN +69 264
#note FINALLY.  i'll sacrifice 5 points and not give him an easy 50 points or 3x3

#note best
>Richard_Spence: LOP 14L POL +20 313
#note k now i know he has the last S, but i think it was pretty reckless to give me that E lane.  and if i play under POL he's screwed.
>Mike_Lean: ACCEPRU O11 PACER +36 316
#note boom goes the dynamite.
>Richard_Spence: EIRSW 15H WIRES +36 349
#note as expected
>Mike_Lean: ACEHLMU C11 HUM +31 347
#note this is where i screw up.  i mistrack and think he's holding IINP, but he's really holding AIIN.  so i know i have to block PIN C11.  after thinking for about 7 minutes, i decide to play HUM C11 for 31 instead of CHUM B2 for 33.  this will make the game 349-347 him.  he'll play PIN B3 then i'll play lacer 1D to go out and win by 2 plus his tiles.  let's get crazy.
>Richard_Spence: AIIN B2 INIA +14 363
#note DAMNIT.  apparently my last decision would have been much easier if i knew he was holding inia, because he had 3 spots for it and i had no chance to win.  did the best i could this game, played almost perfectly and still lost.  oh well, good tournament.
