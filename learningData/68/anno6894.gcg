#note a lot of interesting choices here. I have to assume he's close, and i wanted to give myself a good counterplay, or at least put off exchanging for a turn. Quackle likes gurus but that doesn't leave me many options with the z. What do you like here?

#note I'm guessing I didn't want to give him a cheap s hook, but that doesn't make much sense since there is already one. I suppose this is more open than B10 though.
