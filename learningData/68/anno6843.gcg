>Jim_Nanavati: EIP J6 PIE +22 22
#note OH M Y GOD HE IS SUCH A LUCKBAG!!!
>Winter: CDDLOOS K8 LOCO +24 44
#note I keep getting the hard racks.
>Jim_Nanavati: ?AABELT 9A rATABLE +66 88
#note And he keeps getting the easy racks.
>Winter: ADDMNRS 9J D.RM +17 61
#note Trying to leave that R open for volatility. Hate to give up my A given the racks I've been drawing.
>Jim_Nanavati: ELZ 8B LEZ +47 135
#note Goddamn it--a third luckbagging in a row???
>Winter: ADENORS M4 RANSO.ED +62 123
#note See, a non-trivial bingo, unlike everything that Yvonne and Jim played against me.
>Jim_Nanavati: ADH 7A DAH +24 159
#note Of course he has the tiles to take the good spot, while I've been a tile off for most of the last three games.
>Winter: ACEGJMO J11 JOG +20 143
#note With hot spots at A1, A9, and N10, I have to try for the better leave that JOG affords.
>Jim_Nanavati: AAEITWW A1 AWAITE. +36 195
#note Meanwhile, who'se getting the obvious plays?
>Winter: ACEEMTU L3 CAME +26 169
#note N10 still glaring and I STILL can't hit it. I wonder what will happen next turn. Anyway, I JUST gave up points with my J and that didn't work out, so I try to max on score to stay in the game.
>Jim_Nanavati: FNOTU N10 FOUNT +48 243
#note OF...COURSE.
>Winter: EINSSTU O7 UNITES +34 203
#note Again, I have to find much harder plays than Jim--it's never been easy for me.
>Jim_Nanavati: ESTW 15L WEST +42 285
#note So far he has only used time for rATABLE. Everything else insant.
>Winter: EFINOST 13L FO. +12 215
#note Again and again, one tile off from a good score!!!
>Jim_Nanavati: G 6L ..G +8 293
#note And he misses (ZA)G. When I dump a tile I'm sure going to look for the best place, and if I've got the blank I'm going to open another line.
>Winter: BEINSTV N2 NIB +15 230
#note Jesus, I can't draw into a bingo to save my life. ANd I don't understand why Quack likes B(YE).
>Jim_Nanavati: ?ADEIIN 13C IDEAtIN. +70 363
#note Yeah, like I didn't see this coming. I drove 500 miles for this???
>Winter: EILRSTV H12 V.RL +33 263
#note I have to take this spot, but I already know I'm going to get 2 Is next turn. And if I see LIV(I)ER I can't play it anyway b/c then I'll never bingo given what I've been drawing.
>Jim_Nanavati: IQ 12C QI +39 402
#note This dude has no shame.
>Winter: EIIRSTU 5A .UI +3 266
#note And just like that--his QI and my lame rack, and the game is over.
>Jim_Nanavati: GHO B1 HOG +32 434
#note Whatever. 5
>Winter: EINRSTV 1H INVERTS +89 355
#note This is me making a jerking motion with my hand.
>Jim_Nanavati: AEPRUXY 4C PREXY +38 472
>Winter: ER F2 RE. +12 367
#note Like I said, whatever.
>Winter: (AU) +4 371
