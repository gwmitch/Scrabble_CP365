#note Mark had been playing pretty slowly, and took a while to play CAROTINS, so I decided to play faster. This was a bad rack to do it on. After I hit my clock I noticed WASABI, which sims worse but would have worked out better in this instance. I would have liked to have the option to decide on it, anyway. And if I gave this rack more time maybe I would have found the star play, FABRIC.

#note Not bad, but ACTIN A11 would have been a lot better, keeping AR with four Ns remaining and blocking a hotspot.

#note After playing very quickly several plays in a row I slowed down to make this decision. I considered several different options: ZEINS/ZINES H1, ZEINS E11, ZEIN E11, ZIT 14F, and ZEP E11 were the ones I wrote on my scoresheet. I reasoned that I didn't want to open up bingo lanes by playing to the triple now, and wanted to get rid of my Is with two remaining. Keeping ENPS seemed to offer a good chance to score next turn.

#note After a long think Championship Player's favorite play is OI N5, supposedly winning 22% of the time. Mark was down fairly low on his clock by this point, so I figured he was more likely to miss bingos or winning sequences than normal.
>Mark_Edelson: ?DEILTT E11 TED +17 432
#note Mark had three winning plays here, but with time ticking down he simply had to slap something down.
