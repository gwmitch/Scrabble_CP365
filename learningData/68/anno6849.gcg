#note BIONT 13I supposedly wins 1% more often, as duplicate or triplicate I's may be a problem.
>Nigel_Richards: X C8 .X +17 373
#note An odd looking play. Look at his next rack, and see if you can figure out what he was up to.
>Nathan: DIIIJRT 12I JI.D +24 426
#note ROJI 13I is a bit better; this is 2nd best, winning 87% of the time. 
>Nigel_Richards: DELORWY B5 WOR.EL +22 395
#note Best. Did you expect anything else? Okay, knowing Nigel's rack had 6 of DELOWRY when he played OX, what was he doing?
>Nathan: IIORTZ 15A RIZ. +56 482
#note He was fishing for one of the three remaining I's for LOWRIDER in two spots, or an O for WORDLORE# at B2. I did not know WORDLORE#, but the game is close enough that trying to block is apparently wrong anyway.
