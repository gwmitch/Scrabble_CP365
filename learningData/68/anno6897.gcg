#note I wasn't a huge fan of this play in retrospect, but it's actually dead even with WENDING which was the other play I had in mind.

>Magra: CCEELMN 9C .E.N +20 49
#note what an odd play. CCEELN actually hits bingos with A, I and U but that doesn't help on this board. ZOOM is even with this.
>Joel_Elkins: I H8 .I +2 78
>Magra: ACCELMO G3 COMA +22 71
#note COCA does a tad better because of the overlaps joel has next turn on column H (ZAP/ZAG).

>Joel_Elkins: AILTX 4G .XTAIL +59 141
#note pretty nice play off of what must have been his second missed fish in a row.
>Magra: AACIOOP 10H POCO +19 126
#note gigantically terrible play. I guess CIAO is sort of hard to see.

#note with 3 Ss unseen I thought I had to make this play to stay competitive. however, the triple lane I'm giving him is actually just as bad as letting him have the S hook, making this a fairly large mistake.

#note note that TRUMPERS is not a word. I made this play because I have the case O up top and a guaranteed 42 points at the bottom left, and therefore figured I could score enough to win. quackle completely disagrees, telling me to make any play leaving EERST or EORST. I have no idea what the right play would be...to be honest my tracking was slightly shifty and I didn't realize I was leaving 1 in the bag, else I would've played TRUMPETS. Upon thinking about it more carefully I think the play is likely FEET at 15L which I didn't think about enough.

#note I really botched the pre-endgame. this hadn't occurred to me at all as a potential scenario. I also wasn't even positive that HOWKS was good and passed it up, which is a huge error - it's a lot easier to win a recount when you lose by 3 than by 8. Also, think about how much better off I would be if I had just played TRUMPETS. he would have another tile and probably would've let me play FORKY at 1E for a gajillion. So I blew this game in the preendgame.

>Joel_Elkins:  (KVY) +26 382
#note he made a nice play in the pre-endgame. WARTS may not be the best way of doing it but given his rack I believe it guarantees him victory no matter what tile he pulls. nice play, joel.
