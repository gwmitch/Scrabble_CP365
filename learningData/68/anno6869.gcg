>Evans_Clinchy: CINQRRW 5A QI +16 103
#note Holding onto the Q too long on this board seemed like it could become a major liability. The sim likes WIRY 4B, perhaps because it sets up the Q, but that seems kinda silly to me. I'd rather go for the sure thing and ditch it now.
>Kristina_Simon: BE 4D B.E +16 105

#note Or CRS. The two leaves appear to be about even here.
>Kristina_Simon: AIO A11 .AOI +5 110
>Evans_Clinchy: ERRSTVZ 13A .VERT +16 119
#note Quackle suggests REVS J4, which restricts bingo lanes against a fishy opponent and scores a little more. RTZ is a fine leave to work with here.
>Kristina_Simon: EO 12D OE +20 130
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGNRSZ C3 ZA +31 150
#note Or ZEE F2, but this seemed safer.

#note The board seemed to be shutting down a little at this point, so I wanted to take some points while it was still possible. SUPERB M2 was a dumb miss, though.
>Kristina_Simon: DEI 1L .IED +28 265
>Evans_Clinchy: ENOOPUX K5 PE +20 264
#note Ugh, what a terrible leave. OX I4 is definitely better than this. No idea what I was thinking here.
>Kristina_Simon: NOW 3F NOW +21 286
>Evans_Clinchy: ACNOOUX L6 COXA +28 292
#note I think it's stronger defensively to hold back the A.
>Kristina_Simon: AELNSTT 10I TALENTS +75 361
#note This bingo never happens if I just play COX.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEENOUY 8K O.EYE +45 337
#note Quackle suggests LEE K10, fishing for a bingo with ENOUY (possibly TOURNEY or YOUNKER in line 13). I went for the sure thing and took a pile of spread points. Winning this game didn't seem realistic.
