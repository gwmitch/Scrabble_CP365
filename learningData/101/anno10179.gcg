>dacrON: DEFKORU 6N FE +28 93
#note Toss up for me between this and K(AG)U. For me, the leave didn't quite seem worth sacrificing 9 points.
>Lila_Crotty: AQT 6F QAT +43 110
>dacrON: DIKORSU F8 .OK +20 113
#note KUDOS to me for not finding KUDOS. I was a bit thrown off by ZA and QAT, so I made an unnecessarily high-variance play.
>Lila_Crotty: BOO 9I BOO +16 126
>dacrON: ADIRSUU 11A RADIUS +25 138
#note Unsurprisingly, Quackle hates this play. I missed (HO)URI outright. I think I gave her too much credit for having a big leave, and wanted to take out WOK_, but slotting the R makes no sense in that case. Actually, come to think of it, I finally decided on this over URUS simply because I wanted to start fresh. With a U, lol.

#note lol.

#note one bingo fits at 10H.

>dacrON: ACEINSX M7 ..X +27 281
#note yuck, XENIA fits at A1. Getting careless here trying to go for the finishing blow.

>dacrON: ACEIINS A1 CANE +27 308
#note fshing one tile off is silly, as at this point I realized how weak ACEINS actually was. Not sure blowing up the rack like this is worth it though. I didn't think of fishing AI at C6.
>Lila_Crotty: CGINORS O1 CRING. +30 200
>dacrON: EIIIOPS -IIO +0 308
#note In hindsight, POISER probably is worth it, if CANE was worth it. Gotta be consistent.

>dacrON: APSTTUV 13H PUTTAS +26 359
#note I apparently completely made this up. At least it sims best. Though her next play shows that it's maybe not so great.
>Lila_Crotty: DE H10 ....ED +33 239
>dacrON: EILNOUV 15B UNLOVE. +12 371
#note um, VELOU(R) is a word. Seriously stellar play there.

>dacrON: ?DIIJLO 2J JaILO. +56 427
#note ...and I get rewarded for it. Quackle says to empty the bag and keep the blank, but Quackle is better at seeing [a lack of] potential outbingos.
