#note Well. P(AG)INAtED, P(AG)ANIzED, P(AG)ANIsED. DEPAINt 10G. PANDIEs is 5th. 
>jayl: EGORTUY 7D GUYOT +20 45
>squush: AABLQUZ 4H QAB.LA +54 147
#note Nice play squush! E(Q)UAL keeping ABZ for 72 points. I was very excited when I saw QAB(A)LA because you rarely play a U-less Q word when you have QU on your rack. 
>jayl: AEIMORS J3 O.IA +19 64
#note (B)IO is best.

>squush: EEMORTW 1A WOR. +33 296
#note W(A)ME, (K)REWE, WEE(K) then WOR(K). That is according to speedy player. I didn't know MORT was 1.5 points better than EEMT. Because of the 5 (!) unseen E's, I prefer WEEK by a bunch.
>jayl: ACGIOOR 14B AC.OO +24 299
#note CO(H)OG
>squush: EEIMRTT 15F EMITTER +82 378
#note For 2 placement reasons, I am willing to sacrifice the 1 point.
>jayl: ACEGIRS C1 .EC +22 321
#note WO(G) simulates definitely best at 6.3% chance of winning.
>squush: DDEIJTU 15A TI +8 386
#note Darnnn. I saw JUDDE(R) but didn't think it was a word. This turn is a disgrace to scrabble. If I draw one of the two remaining R's, I can hit (A)DJURED for 64, sewing up the game. JUDDE(R) is definitely best, with (A)UDITED closely behind. Oh, and bluehair? IT wins 86.13% and TI wins 86.09%. 
>jayl: AEGINRS 12G SERINGA +75 396
#note (A)NGARIES, (A)RGINASE.
>squush: DDEJRUY M11 J.Y +26 412
#note Darn (A)DJURED is blocked. Quackle simulation says J(A)Y wins 100% and DY(A)D wins 100%
>jayl: EEFPSU B10 F.U +14 410
#note ...And yet quackle says jayl can win by playing PE(L)F. F(L)U also wins.
