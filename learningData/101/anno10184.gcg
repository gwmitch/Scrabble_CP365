>dacrON: DGGHINY L11 DINGY +31 117
#note I thought of DINGHY, but I only looked at the board from upside down, so I though I was making DI. What a terrible play.
>Jan_Cardia: APU 15L .AUP +27 115
>dacrON: EFGHINO H10 HOEING +41 158
#note I personally like this better than FOH. the ING leave is just asking for trouble. Quackle of course disagrees. OHING makes sense too though.
>Jan_Cardia: BDDO 6J BOD.D +19 134
#note In keeping with the spaz tendancies of this game, Jan miscounted BOD(E)D as 21. She would have played BOD if she knew BOD(E)D was only 19, which would've blocked my next play.

#note Jan chickened out on a 2x2 here but wouldn't tell me what it was :(

#note no spot for COMSYmP. Correctly chickened out of MYOPiCS. COPY(CAT) is cute.

>dacrON: ?EEERRT 1F RE. +5 340
#note I was almost positive that fE(R)RETER and pREERE(C)T were good, but I really didn't want to risk the game here. After this play, she is forced to open the board, and I'm going to draw a bingo next turn anyway, so I'm not sacrificing that much here by being risk averse.
