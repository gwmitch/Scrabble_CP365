#note I could exchange or play HUCK or BUCK, but by playing this I take away a good scoring spot and still keep tiles that I think can score reasonably on this board.

>Noah: BCHMNOQ 11E Q. +22 236
#note No BOTCH or MOUCH. I just wanted to get rid of the Q here. These tiles can be useful later on.

#note Blocks lanes and keeps a reasonable leave, I also considered something like BLAME 6B, but this seemed better.

#note I can't always win this game, but this seemed best to me. Something like LEA is too few points and falls prey also to DELEADING or something. Quackle found an interesting play: AGIO 7E. It's not that great for spread, but it does leave one and the bag and probably outscore her when she does bingo. On the other hand, spread is a factor here, so this or ALAE or something might be better. Actually ALAE is better anyway.

#note ETUI 13L is much better. I was hoping she would just go fast since she had almost nothing left on her clock.
