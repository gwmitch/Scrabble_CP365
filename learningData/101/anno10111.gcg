#note marlon finally slowed down to the point where i got to track a bit... and then i had no idea what to do with this rack. i kind of hate throwing letters in the open.

#note i really considered just playing YO L1 and biding my time with this rack, but i figure taking the bingo means less time to the end of the game, which is less time for me to much things up. AmYLOSE 14H sims higher. i thought my bingo a) was prettier aesthetically and b) would give me better comebacks if he bingoed.
