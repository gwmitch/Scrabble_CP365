#note I've been in a big slump against Mike, lately, and I said "will I ever draw anything against you?" here. Seeing how the rest of the game went, I felt like a dick, and was glad when he called me on it later. Unacceptable behavior. Okay so the last game vs Leesa didn't help. But I felt bad for a few turns, and I think that letting my guard down there really didn't help me when I miss high prob bingos soon (grab popcorn now)

#note HERE perhaps.
>Mike: HMO 10D OHM +28 105
#note lol.
>dacrON: ?AEILQV K1 QI +15 63
#note right play?
>Mike: DERRSTT D9 T.RT +8 113
#note DREST looks BEST here.
>dacrON: ?AEILTV H7 V..IETALs +86 149
#note I'd like to say I was trying to draw a challenge here. If I was, I'd have played V(AR)IoLATE, which I did not see. This is just lame. I honestly think I thought VALETI(N)g wasn't a 2x2, but I flat out missed the others.
>Mike: ADENRSY 11G Y.ARENDS +74 187
#note That was preventable.
>dacrON: CELLNOO 15A COLONEL. +80 229
#note okay well that would've been prevented too...

#note Didn't know what to do here, so figured I'd just take out his spot?
>Mike: BEIISTU 7B .IBE +13 383
>dacrON: DEGINOP E2 PONGE. +18 448
#note I didn't see his other outplay, so the endgame streak ends here. This is 9 worse.
>Mike: ISTU 6J .TUIS +7 390
#note I apparently gave him SITU(P). Didn't notice SUI(N)T either. go figure.
