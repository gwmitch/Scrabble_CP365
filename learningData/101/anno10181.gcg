>dacrON: BCIORUY 8H CORBY +32 32
#note Slight preference to BUOY. It's hard to sacrifice that many points on a five tile draw, even if it is IU.
>KFC: EEF 9I FEE +25 25
>dacrON: EIIRSTU -IU +0 32
#note I don't think it's quite worth playng ETUI. EIRST is too strong.
>KFC: EFT 10J FET +33 58
>dacrON: CEEIRST 11D RECITES +75 107
#note So I thought of CERITES, and then promptly forgot about it, thinking it was just TIERCES/RECITES. moron.
>KFC: ILPU H11 .ULIP +24 82
>dacrON: DGIMNUV G10 V.M +12 119
#note I knew I was being greedy as I played this, but I couldn't get myself to play DIV(I)NG. Didn't know MU(R)ING.
>KFC: ANSTW M9 WANTS +31 113

>KFC: IZ 6J ZI. +32 145
>dacrON: EHINTUV D6 VENTU.I +22 161
#note This play is so bad I almost think I wrote my rack down wrong, but the H is on my next rack, so I guess not. All I remember is tilting a bit because of another UV draw, and wanted to be rid of them + reach for the blanks, but it's not worth sacrificing 10 points to HIVE.

#note EPIGON(I) felt too volaile. I feel like I autopiloted here - what to do? PINGO? EPIGON(I)?
>KFC: ?BEHIST N6 BITES +52 305
#note (G)oBSHITE is the only one worth playing because it scores 101.
>dacrON: DEIILNR O7 DIN +27 298
#note PINGO would've yielded (U)NDERLIE, but I'd still be in a hole, assuming she has anything at all.
>KFC: ?AHLNOR 14B HORNtA.L +70 375
#note LONgHA(I)R scores 86. She's betting that I dont bingo. I think that's the right thing to do, although I clearly left something decent after DIN.
