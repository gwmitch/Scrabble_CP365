#note Dominick wanted me to give him a P for PUGILIST.
>Noah: ??AFIMP 13D AMPlIFy +72 86
#note I thought of rIFAMPIn, but I didn't play it. It might be best, though the two scoring spots this opens probably even out okay, so I don't know.

#note I also noticed TRIBES, but didn't realize it scored more than this. This might not be much worse, or at all actually, because the T is more dangerous than the B there. BRIES is also an appetizing play, in more way than one :). I think that might be best.

#note My rationale was: since my rack isn't doing that much on this board anyway, why not block off the part of the board that will be difficult to contain later? The right side seems significantly easier to block, plus I save Z(A), so I like this play quite a bit. One downside is that this allows some setups: he could play JAR or JIN, and with AAADDIIINNNRR left, this could be a problem. On the other hand, I'll usually be able to block a JIN setup, either with an underlap or JINX or JINK, and I can often inhibit, if not completely block, a JAR setup.

#note Yikes. Then I missed ADZ, which often gives me trouble.

#note Really disappointed to find the star play after I hit my clock. I knew this wasn't great, but I was low on time and played it. If only I had spotted KR(E)M(LIN) in time :(.
