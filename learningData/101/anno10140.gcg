#note Spent a while here. I was nervous about keeping AEIT with L4 AWA. But there are consonants open in bingo lanes, so maybe I shouldn't be as concerned. Quackle prefers L4 AWA.

#note Ugh. That L just made me so nervous. I sacrificed way too much to block here. I should do the obvious L11 IVY.

#note I only wrote down KLNVYE, but I am guessing my last tile was an E. If so, I missedly N5 EVENLY.

#note 12D HEARKEN is such a good play. Bad miss.

#note This is such a bizarre sequence. Here I decided it was a good time to be defensive. I know my leave is bingo prone, but I figured Cecilia would be forced to open a lane and I could bingo there.
>Cecilia_Le: EGR 5A REG +17 266
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEELOST 14I O. +5 287
#note Not the lane I was hoping for. Now I do a 180. If I can't ensure that there are no bingo lanes, I want to make sure there are two. Like I said, bizarre sequence. Not going to do Quackle's A4 ORATE, since Cecilia bingos on the B column and I have no room for my own bingo.
>Cecilia_Le: BB -BB +0 266
#note Cecilia is under 30 seconds at this point.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEELOST 15C OLEATES +76 363
#note I should mention at this point that we are both really low on time. This was a pretty weird game with lots of short plays and exchanges. I'm at about 2 mins and Cecilia is at about 30 seconds.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BDHNQUU 7A .UQ +22 385
#note I have about two minutes to Cecilia's 10-15 seconds. Technically I don't have a win here. But realistically, I can win if she goes over time. Inexplicably, we both missed Cecilia's out play. I scanned the board for open vowels and concluded she couldn't go out in one, so I decided to play quickly and pressure her clock. Completely missed (E)DuCTS. None of the blocking plays win the endgame, but they make her find a winning out in two in 10-15 seconds, so B11 HUB, for example, gives me a chance if she misses 6A IDS in response. Basically, missing EDuCTS was a big error for the both of us.
