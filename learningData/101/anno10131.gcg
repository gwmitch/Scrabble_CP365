>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEORSTY 8G YE +10 10
#note YO is probably better leave-wise. But I liked the hookability of YE, in case Andrew plays defensively.
>Andrew_Friedman: HOO 9G OHO +19 19
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EKORSTT G8 ..K +10 20
#note Against a human who will presumably play blockishly after a play like KYE, I like YOK better to open more lanes. I didn't consider KOTO, but it's not open enough.
>Andrew_Friedman: CEGNOR 11C CONGER +29 48
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EFORSTT D9 FO.T +14 34
#note Other placement is obviously better. I wanted another line for a 7, but opening the line through the T is more important, as there are lots of spots for sevens already. Plus I give up AFOOT. Also, COFT and OF are probably better.
>Andrew_Friedman: AHOR 8A HORA +33 81
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIIRSTW F2 WIRIEST +76 110
>Andrew_Friedman: ENTZ 4D NE.TZ +48 129
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENOQSS -OQ +0 110
#note I was looking for a play like 5H AEONS, but somehow the obvious word eluded me. I need to kill that Z. This trade is pretty poor.
>Andrew_Friedman: LTU H1 LUT. +39 168
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENPSSX E2 AP.X +53 163
#note Better than EXPANSES, which I admittedly didn't see.
>Andrew_Friedman: UV F11 .UV +7 175
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEINSSW H11 .EWIN +27 190
#note Damn I chickened out on RAWIN. And RESAW is probably better too.
>Andrew_Friedman: ?ABCIRT 15A BACTeRI. +86 261
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADGIJSS 2A JIGS.. +34 224

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADIQRSU 12H .QUID +30 254
>Andrew_Friedman: DEFILN 2H .NFILED +38 314
#note Grrrrrr.... long hold and release. I knew it wasn't good, but kept finding perfectly fine uses for it in a sentence. So awful. This should have lost me the game.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEELMRS L6 EMERAL.S +62 316
#note Saw the obviously better MEASLIER when I hit the clock. I deserved to lose this game.
>Andrew_Friedman: AEE A1 A.EE +36 350
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABDDEOR 1K BARED +39 355
>Andrew_Friedman: APT 3K TAP +28 378
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ADEILO M13 OI +8 363
#note No idea what to do here, but this play looks to give me the best shot. I am not confident with the G and V unseen, which Andrew can use the kill the board.
>Andrew_Friedman: GIMNSUV K6 MUN +15 393
#note Andrew placed N11 VIMS, placed his finger on the clock button, and then withdrew his play and did this instead.
