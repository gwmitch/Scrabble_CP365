#note Probably went to the "hoard the X" well once too often. FLEX is preferred.

#note I arrived home to a facebook message from Matthew: "SYENITE... *shoots self*" I asked if he wanted me to keep mum about it when I posted. "Oh, just point it out. No shame in STEE moments," he said. True dat. (After FLEX, it doesn't fit, though.)

#note Matthew held before saying "oh, a noun" and accepting. I said "You should know, you are one!" Matthew pointed out that Stefan, Joel and I were the three foreigners at the table.

#note After the game, Matthew wondered if JARL at 5B was better. Quackle says he made the right choice.

#note Duck prefers PLENTY at B5 or PELF here. I don't. PE(O)NY I should've considered, though.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ADMORS 2G l.RDOMAS +78 254
#note Highest-scoring bingo. Solid find.

#note BANIA(N) is eight better. My plan to lull Matthew to sleep with my consistency worked; not counting the bingo bonuses, probably the lowest variance among turn scores in any game I've ever played.
