#note While EGINR is a good leave, I liked the 8 extra points, killing a hotspot, and opening a new harder-to-block lane. Quackle says go for EGINR.

#note Joel made it obvious that his rack last turn had sucked, so I wanted to put the pressure on.

#note I apparently completely misevaluated this play. Quackle wants me to fish in the top right, which I think is ridiculous. It's a pretty friendly pool, the game is tied, and his rack is random. Is it really worth putting the game down to fishing?
