>Ryan_Fischer: AAEFHSW 8H AWASH +30 30
#note Champ says this or HAAF.  I think spending the S, especially here, is right.  Just didn't quite work out for me.

>Ryan_Fischer: CDEIIRR F1 DERRIC. +22 68
#note K5 CR(OS)IER 36, B9 (I)RIDIC 22.  Just RIC(K) would've been fine for balance.  I just really thought this board was getting away from me, and I wanted to turn over tiles and try to make things as crazy volatile as possible.
>Erickson_Smith: AUY D9 .UAY +32 123
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEILPV 1B BIPE.AL +45 113
#note K5 PL(OS)IVE 48.  Okay, that's TWO 2x2s through OS.  Weird.  I'm very proud of BIPE(D)AL.  Making plays like that this whole game, but never able to catch him.
>Erickson_Smith: OX 8A OX +36 159
#note Sigh.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGNNOUV 3B GOVE.N +22 135
#note 4D UN(R)OVE 26.  Definitely.
>Erickson_Smith: AEINOST 2H ATONIES +70 229
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGILNU D1 .A.ING +24 159
#note B1 (B)U(G) 12 is what Champ says.  I figure to catch him now I need to score and get REALLY lucky.  And L(I)NGUAE for 32 is probably a good bet except for it killing the I and R.
>Erickson_Smith: DLW L1 W.LD +24 253
>Ryan_Fischer: ELLOSUU -UULLO +0 159
#note Figure I have to exchange here to have any hope.  The scoring plays break up the rack beyond recognition.
>Erickson_Smith: AJNN 11B JN.NA +24 277
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEGRS B1 .A.GER +24 183
#note Saw (QUAY)AGE.  Fun, but too much?  Might make him sweat, though.  Coulda considered (J)AGER.  I have the last two As.

#note Okay, tile gods.  Thisz a joke, right?  Let's see how he likes THIS!
>Erickson_Smith: BFLU 15D FUB +21 357
#note Put down FLUB before thinking better of it.  Not that I'd take the S hook right away anyway.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IOOPRU 4J OU. +4 269
#note C6 UPO(N) 23!  A perfect play, gives me some small hope.
>Erickson_Smith: M 13B .M +16 373
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IOPRTT F11 .T +2 271
#note Didn't want to chance TIPTOeR*.  Champ says fishing off the T is the right move, but it's just a matter of where.  It has a better valuation in some places than others.  1N (E)T 6 valuates at 115.7.  My playing where I did actually hurt me more.  Low on time, my thought process was hurt.  I thought I was helping, giving myself another place to play, but forgot even with that junk he could still slip something in.
