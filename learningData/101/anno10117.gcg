#note For obvious reasons, better than the only available bingo: EXIGENCe/EXIGENCy.
>Jason: BISTTUY 10F BUTTY +30 119
#note After Chris Lipe once told the story of Adam Logan playing OBTUSITY (with this rack, I believe), I always wanted to play it. So close...

#note (P)O(O)D is a better fish, although it leaves this spot open. Still the star play, though.

#note Or not.
>Jason: AHINORU A12 HO.R +33 250
#note OHIA at 14I: gutsy but beautiful. Wish I'd seen it.
>Jeff_Clark: EEFOTVZ 1L .OVE +27 322
>Jason: AEGINRU 2C ARGUEIN. +62 312
#note Not even Collins. Well, desperate times call for desperate measures... Back in the game!
>Jeff_Clark: EFHLSTZ 1A FEZ +56 378
#note Or not. That explains why he didn't even hold.
>Jason: DELNRVW H1 W.LD +30 342
>Jeff_Clark: ?ADHLST N6 HA. +30 408
#note Better than SH(I)TLoAD, which he should've played anyway just to play it. HADST at 15D would've been sweet.
>Jason: ADEENRV N1 .AV +18 360
#note Especially because then my REINVADE would've played.
>Jeff_Clark: ?ADFLST 15D FAD +25 433
>Jason: DEEMNOR O5 DOM.NEER +73 433
#note Never considered not bingoing, but CP says ZANDER gives me a 35% shot vs. 19ish% for MODERNE or this.
>Jeff_Clark: ?ALLSTT 3A LAS +30 463
#note Didn't know (F)LATLeTS or TALLiTS. aTLATLS would've been awesome.

>Jason: I A1 .I. +6 466
#note At least I got $10 for this. That was how my day went: Kept putting myself in position, kept coming up short.
