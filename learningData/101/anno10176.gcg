#note Spoilsport.

#note Right word, wrong spot. 9F.

>Jason: AEELMVY 6G YLEM +32 78
#note The race to the X is on! I kind of liked it, too; Pete's fixing to bingo and when he does I'll be further behind than I am now. Embrace volatility.

#note Pleasantly surprised to see this. C'mon, X!

>Jason: AEKPRTU 1K APTER +46 239
#note At this point, I was starting to wonder if I would become the first player in Scrabble history to turn over 60 tiles and not draw one power tile.
>Pete_Zeigler: ENOU E8 .OUEN +10 240
>Jason: IKLRSSU D11 RUSK +22 261
#note SUSLIK at 4J is the star play. SULK at F11 is best among words I've heard of before.
>Pete_Zeigler: ABILNO H10 ALBINO +38 278
>Jason: EIILNQS 1A QI +38 299
#note I decided to do that whole "keep a good leave" thing I've been hearing about. Now I was thinking since the odds were decent Pete would hit the X spot, I might need to bingo to blunt it.
>Pete_Zeigler: IX G13 XI +36 314
>Jason: CEIJLNS 15A JINS +46 345
#note There's a fine line between fast-playing someone in time trouble and being stupid. Heard of ZIN and ZA, Jason? In hindsight, J(IN)NI (though Duck likes just JIN).
>Pete_Zeigler: EG L1 ..GE +14 328
>Jason: AACEILO 14B LA.E +22 367
#note Lucky my blunder the prior turn didn't hurt me.
>Pete_Zeigler: Y 7I ....Y +31 359
#note WOOFY#. Pete's been studying his Collins fives containing FOY again... (He got a nickel or dime out of me from FONLY# at the Akron Collins tourney, a running joke between us.)
>Jason: ACIOPSZ K9 .AZI +26 393
>Pete_Zeigler: AEEMNT L11 ATMEN +31 390
#note Pete's got this whole "play phony fives when he can't challenge" thing down to a science. Scored as 33.
>Jason: COPS 14K P.CS +16 409
#note SCOP is a word. (See why my spread sucked so much for 20 rounds?) I started telling myself it might be Collins-only and I should play it safe.
>Pete_Zeigler: E K14 .E +6 396
#note (Minus 20 for time.)
>Pete_Zeigler:  (O) +2 398
