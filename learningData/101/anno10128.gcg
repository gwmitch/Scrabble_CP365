#note Or FEW? I thought CF would be better than CG with the two Ts open. Apparently they both bingo an equal amount of the time, which is very surprising to me considering what FEW does to the board. The big difference is what they give back. WAG gives the E hook and a nice overlap opportunity.

#note There is nothing great here. I really hated F4 GAY, but it outsims my play. I figured the Y can always score next turn, but the vowel heavy leave could be really awful. It seems the big difference is the fact that AEIOR is actually decently bingo prone. Plus 6 more points up front for GAY.

#note Oh, CURVEY is a word? Ok. Also, C2 VOYEUR is obviously better. Silly miss because I saw VOYEUR on my rack.

#note Missed 15D ZONKED which should have been on my radar. It's close. In hindsight, I should have been aware that the Z is not great on this board.
>Debbie_Stegman: APR J12 .AP +26 354
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: JNQRRUZ 4G Q. +22 344
#note I figured if I could just pull a vowel, I could get some points out of my power tiles. But apparently I trade JNRZ here. I think if I am keeping QU, I should keep N too for a shot at QUANGO. I'm surprised QU is considered the best power tile on this board.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DJNRRUZ -DJRZU +0 344
#note There are several routes to take here. But I decided to go for the bingo, possibly catching Debbie with one of these high-pointers. Now Quackle doesn't like trading. 15D DURNED instead? I am confused. I guess I am sure to draw vowels after that. I just then race with JZ.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEHLNRS 14B HERBS +31 375
#note Okay, changing my mind. The bingo likely isn't happening. So now I am taking points and hoping to draw a big J or Z play. 15K BINER sims best, I guess keeping the S and hoping to draw J or Z for a big play to TOOTS. But what are the odds Debbie doesn't have an S yet? Maybe I need to bank on that.

#note I am low on time and can't play this endgame properly. I definitely can't win, however.
