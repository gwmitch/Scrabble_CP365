#note This is Collins. I won't fault myself for allowing it. It looked perfectly reasonable and it's not one I would have studied yet. Oh well.

>Joel_Sherman: ADMNORS J5 RODSMAN +73 145
#note So I guess I could challenge this play too.

#note Or JUGA? L-hook seems a little more dangerous than the S-hook...

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AGIMTXY 6L MIX +59 215
#note Keeping STAGY for next turn.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABGLTUY O5 .TABLY +46 261
#note Maybe H11 BULGY and cash the T next turn? I dunno, there are a lot of Ts unseen and that S is the juiciest spot. I prefer taking this now.

#note 10L WAVY may be better. If Joel hits his bingo, I'll need one back. So I can't afford to blow up this rack with WAIVE. Mistake.
