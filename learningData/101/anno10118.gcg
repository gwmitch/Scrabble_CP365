>Jason: DIIMOTU C3 MID +26 132
#note Not so good. DIMOUT at 10H is the clear sim leader.
>Stefan_Rau: EEJORST 13C RESOJET +108 192
#note I didn't like SHEARINGS (it's good), but given the circumstances/my rack I wasn't going to raise too much of a stink.

#note Stefan told me what he left here after the game ... can't remember all of it, but know it included the S.
>Jason: ACELORV N8 LEVA.OR +36 259
#note Speedy approves. And given that I want to turn over tiles to draw a WEN hook and create offsetting hotspots, I like it.
>Stefan_Rau: EEEMRSY 15H SEEM +39 273
#note Duck prefers SEEMER, I prefer this.

#note Duck strongly prefers AEDINE. Given that there are only five unseen vowels, I'm not sure I agree. Having lost two games by single-digits in the early bird (would've been three if I didn't brain fart in the endgame vs. Keller), I was beginning to wonder if this was another game I was going to play/draw just well enough to lose.
>Stefan_Rau: KNU H1 .UNK +14 371
#note  But I knew I'd won after this play. Obviously Stefan has to do this with the U as his only vowel (N(U)K(E) or K(U)N(E) instead?), but if I draw the Q then I'm going to score well with it and if he does he's going to get stuck with it.
