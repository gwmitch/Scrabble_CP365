#note cant give him a spot. may as well be aggressive since A/I + GP is likely coming.

#note the other F! Counted FAINTER(S) as 70, but I want to be aggressive here.

#note I don't think this is too open, but I didn't consider EX(P)O which merits some thought.
>David_Engelhardt: ??EINNO 6A INtONEs +63 277
#note 15D INOs(I)NEs or O3 sONNIEs score 75.
>dacrON: ACEERXY N2 A.RY +24 304
#note I have no idea what to do here. My thought was to set up an X spot, since I amazingly can't touch the I. I thought of EXAC(t)ER and EXCRE(t)A, whose comeback potentials I didn't care for, but not EXCRE(T)A at the top. A bit volatile for me, but it makes some sense. Definitely overanalyzed this play. What to do?

#note fml.
>dacrON: CEEESWX 6I W.E. +16 320
#note And I follow up a terrible play with a great play. Quackle likes WE at 5D for 19, which I had down on the board, and saw this alternative as I was going for my clock. I like my play better because it makes what I am going for less obvious. any of LITU would help here.

#note whoa, that was unexpected, albeit the most likely draw.

#note sweet.

#note Just incase W(I)RILY was phony. This is 4 back.
