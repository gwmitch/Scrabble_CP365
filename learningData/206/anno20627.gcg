>Danny_Panganiban: BGNO 8G BONG +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: EINOPRY K5 PYRO +26 26
#note I didn't know PYRONINE. Otherwise, EINOPR bingos with just over 50% of unseen letters. Of course, I can't possibly know things like that during the actual game. PYRO didn't seem to give away any super cheap points. I can also play it for 30 at 9F.
>Danny_Panganiban: AEEJ L3 AJEE +31 45
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINNRT 9F CINE +18 44
#note Not having an O made me sad here. Also, this position probably warrants fishing, despite my attempts to get away from too much fishing. CRETIN bingos with AEIO, which already looks pretty good. I like C(A)N because it stops him from abusing the J too much.
>Danny_Panganiban: AGNT J3 GNAT +20 65
>Matthew_Larocque: IMNRRTV 3J .R.M +14 58
#note Not leaving any vowels last turn got me into trouble here. TRIGRAM and MIGRANT fit here!
>Danny_Panganiban: DO M3 .OD +22 87
>Matthew_Larocque: INRTUVW -ITUVW +0 58
#note Spoilers: Danny gets both the blanks, but I still end up winning this game. Q prefers keeping RT despite the bag.
>Danny_Panganiban: ENR M3 ...ERN +17 104
>Matthew_Larocque: ADNORSX 7G ODA +20 78
#note No reason to dink off the X and let Danny score all the points with it.
>Danny_Panganiban: VV -VV +0 104
>Matthew_Larocque: ENQRSXZ -KQX +0 78
#note I forgot to write this down, but I drew something like this and exchanged keeping ERNS.
>Danny_Panganiban: AW 8M .AW +18 122
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINRST 10I STEARIN +65 143
#note Seemed like the best bingo defensively.
>Danny_Panganiban: CEIST O10 .ICEST +33 155
>Matthew_Larocque: DEFLOYZ 14J FOLEY. +40 183
#note This could end badly, but 40 points is a lot.
>Danny_Panganiban: ENOP 15G PONE +23 178
#note He has NOPE  for 32 at N1, but I would have countered with ZONA.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFIIOZ 14C DIAZO +39 222
#note Wish I had seen ZODIA(C) or even AZOI(C). That would have really given Danny a hard time.
>Danny_Panganiban: AEX 15A AXE +33 211
#note He can play this for 42 at 11J.
>Matthew_Larocque: FIO 13M FO. +27 249
#note Missed rack.
>Danny_Panganiban: ELTU D13 T.L +16 227
#note Danny mentioned after the game that he should have played ETUI instead.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAHIRTU 11J AHI +26 275
>Danny_Panganiban: EIU C12 EI.. +14 241
>Matthew_Larocque: AGMRTUV B10 VUM +20 295
#note I'm not usually glad to draw a V to go with my U, but this turns the board into a bingo graveyard (good with those blanks looming) and there aren't even any Os left!
>Danny_Panganiban: DU 4H DU. +6 247
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGHIRT 5F GIE +7 302
#note I'm passing up an awful lot of points here. Despite what it does defensively, he still has the G13 option for scoring if he has the W, K, or B. The thing is, if he plays down to the D, the resulting s-hook is not easy to block. I'd have to keep the T to play UT/TAPED, or hope to draw an S or  a blank. Or a U for UDON. Maybe 13G HAG would make sense then.
>Danny_Panganiban: ITW 13G WIT +23 270
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHLQRT O4 THRA. +12 314
#note A grave brain fart, because I was fishing for QI/QI except I already have QAT! And getting Q stuck here would be a soul-crushing ordeal. F-
>Danny_Panganiban: U M13 ..U +6 276
#note It seems very likely that Danny would have won if he had something like SLUR 12G and an outplay next turn.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEKLQSV H12 Q. +21 335
>Danny_Panganiban: ??ILRSU 12H .IS +17 293
>Matthew_Larocque: BEKLSV L9 V..L +14 349
#note Instead of KAIL because I wasn't sure how else to get rid of the V.
>Danny_Panganiban: ??LRU F9 .URL +8 301
#note Danny has two words that play out.
>Matthew_Larocque: BEKS K13 K.S +14 363
#note BE(R)K/KE(R)B
>Danny_Panganiban: ?? N2 as +7 308
#note al for 17! I actually picked up the blank slip and threw it at him. Pretty funny.
>Danny_Panganiban:  (BE) +8 316
#note Danny went overtime - but amazingly I did not. A rare feat.
