#note Right spot, wrong word. VIG better. Normally take the QI, bt no Us out yet and that spot is begging for 45 points to be taken by Carla.

>Chris: CIIPQUV B6 QU.P +35 190
#note I had a bad feeling. Was hoping it would stay open a play. I was a favorite to draw another U and could get rid of the E hook

#note What a find by my Bunny! She said, "Send this to David." So, here you are, pal!
>Chris: EIITUUZ -ITUU +0 262
#note I don't like ZIT at all here. I exchanged ITUU. 4 other Ts out and I had my eye squarely on the -ED at O14-15
>Carla_Cree: EHNOY 3C HONEY +40 322
#note Carla knew the new YAS and capitalized
>Chris: ?EINRTZ O7 eTERNIZ.. +107 369
#note Pretty nice draw here and I got payoff. I called it 110. Just seeing the error now and we did not recount.
>Carla_Cree: ANOT K8 NOTA +17 339
#note When the game is toward the end and there are 3 letters out that hook a place, odds are opponent has a couple and leaving that hook open allows for an easy dump of what could be unwieldy tiles with 3 Ts and 3 Us out. Good move here by Carla.
>Chris: RTTTUUU 2C UT +9 378
#note Oh what a miss here. Rut is a lot better. I just knew I couldn't play TUT allowing JARL and had to block JAW
>Carla_Cree: AIJLOVW M3 J.IL +22 361
#note VIOL and a few others win. Tough to figure out and her clock was at 30 seconds. This gave her a nice out set up and alloed for VOW, then AVOW if I got cute trying to block.
>Chris: RRTTUU J2 TR.UT +9 387
#note Did not see OUTRE. Couldn't get cute playing NUT or OUR.
