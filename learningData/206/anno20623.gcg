>New_Player_1: ?EEGKOR 8D KEROGEn +82 82
#note Al being Al nails the only bingo in this rack. I almost hold but remember this good. Of course this is good, top 10,000 7 letter word.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEESTV F8 .AVE +15 15
#note Best play! Almost did nAVE J8 but saw this was an extra point and makes the board harder to shut down. VERA and AVER are RAVE's anagrams. After this place I hold EAST.
>New_Player_1: AFNOOQW E11 HOD +24 106
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAAENST K3 ANATASE +76 91
#note Best play! When I pulled two A's in a row, it looked bleak, but then I pulled an N, and five seconds of shuffling later realized I had ANATASE.
>New_Player_1: ?AGIMNT L9 TeAMING +74 180
#note Al thought he was a missing some incredible bingo. In reality he sacrificed only 2 points. MATTING, MASTING, MOATING, MARTING at L9 and eNIGMATA and AGMINATe at 3F would have worth 76 points. No sense in losing any sleep over this. And given Al's nasal congestion today, he needs a lot of sleep.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAELNOO L2 ALONE +20 111
#note 15J LA(G)OON for 21 points was the rockstar play according to Quackle. I can see why, AE leave is superior to AO leave plus a triple word is occupied and bingo lanes are left open. I'm happy enough with my play though. FYI, we were playing new 2's. Maybe even all of TWL15 but those scenarios never came up.
>New_Player_1: CEHIRST I6 CH.STIER +69 249
#note This was a good bingo but not a great bingo for Al. D4 CHIRKEST forming THE as well for 90 points is the rockstar play. 14F CITHRENS and CITHERNS for 74 points and I7 HERETICS are also better. Al's play gives away too many comeback plays in the H column as he is about to find out.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACFMOW H12 FOAM +50 161
#note Best play! What did I tell you about comeback plays?
>New_Player_1: BDRRTVW M1 QAT +32 281
>Jonathan_Lindh: AZ K11 ZA +48 209
>New_Player_1: BDIRRVW G7 F.X +42 323
#note No clue what my rack was, but I needed those 48 points.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CELSSWW 14A CLEWS +28 237
#note Best play again! I maybe behind, but I am making a lot of good plays!
>New_Player_1: BDIRRUV 15L .LIB +21 344
>Jonathan_Lindh: LNORSUW D12 WO. +31 268
#note I have no clue what my rack was. But once again like the ZA play, I needed the points.
>New_Player_1: DIRRUVY -???? +0 344
#note Al apparently had too many vowels...
>Jonathan_Lindh: LNORSUU -LNOR +0 268
#note And I needed vowels.
>New_Player_1: DIRRUVY A11 EVI.T +42 386
#note A12 VICE would have been more defensive. Al has the lead.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIRRST B5 STIRRED +65 333
#note I got the second play at least. E2 DESTRIER was the best play and I didn't even look there. I knew DESTRIER too.

>New_Player_1: DNOU 3A .OUND +16 449
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGIIRUU D1 GE.II +16 405
#note Ugly rack, but there is an out in two. Yay for well played endgames!
>New_Player_1: ??DIJNY 14J JI. +26 475
>Jonathan_Lindh: RUU 1D .URU +5 410
#note Only out play. Final Score was 475-426. Was there a tile missing? Quackle isn't functioning right today.
