#note He blocked NUGGETY so I decided to be cute.  If I draw one of the two A's, it's ON!

>Tasha: AGGRTUZ 2M GAR +29 396
#note Yay, it worked.  I spent a few minutes looking at the pool before playing GAR.  No E's in the bag made finding possible bingos surprisingly easy.  Okay, there's only one playable bingo, but if I read him right he doesn't have the right letters so I have nothing to be afraid of by emptying the bag.  But don't try this at home because sometimes I can be overly confident when it comes to knowing which bingos are left.  Why empty the bag in this situation?  In hindsight, this definitely wasn't a good id- BAH!!  I'm no chicken! I know I'm right about this!  Probability and all that nonsense is on my side! LET'S DO THIS!
