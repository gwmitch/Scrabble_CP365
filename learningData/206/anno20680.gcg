#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: OPT 7G POT +21 21
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGJSTT 9I JET +36 66
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EHI 10J HIE +29 50
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGPSTU F8 .UG +10 76
#note 5th best play! L8 GEE was best at 17 points. 9F TUP was 4th best at 24 points and highest scoring.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?AEILNT 11C ELAsTIN +68 118
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEKPST C9 KE.PS +32 108
#note Should have done this at L8 for 43 instead of 32.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: CEORR M8 CORER +15 133
#note I know HIER* was no good, but it set me up nicely.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEERSTU 13I DUETS +32 140
#note 8th best play! And highest scoring. 8M CUD plugging the triple for 18 points. I can see why; EERST leave.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: RY 8M .RY +24 157
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGIRTUW 12C .IG +19 159
#note If I have my rack correct, this is the 7th best play. WIRER or WIRE 12K is better.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ACZ N5 CZA. +35 192
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEORTUW J12 W.D +11 170
#note All plays sucks with no play to put OUTDREW. I'm not doing 10B WE Quackle!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: FI 12G IF +20 212
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEHORTU 11K TR.E +16 186
#note Did I really miss 12J WHERE? Boy this is ugly.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AAEELNO 6M A.O +12 224
>Jonathan_Lindh: ELNNOUW O10 UNWON +17 203
#note Best play! Somehow. There's nothing good on this board.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IO 13E OI +6 230
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEHLLNS N14 EH +14 217
#note 5J BLENCH for 33 if I have this right. My play was BAD!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DO 15L DO. +9 239
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABLLNS B13 ALL +8 225
#note This is the genius play of the game. It doesn't even sim on Quackle's plays but it opens up too more lanes, and clears off double A's and double L's. This play won me the game. E5 BLAIN is Quackle's best but I don't think it gives me a good chance to win. Fortune favors the bold, as this game proves.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AGIL 15A G.IAL +21 260
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEEMNS J1 BENAMES +71 296
#note Best play! BEMEANS in same spot for same points is tied for best. BASEMEN is the other anagram which is unplayable on this board.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EORSX 1J .OXERS +69 329
#note Heart breaking! Or is it? Wait until you see what comes next!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DENQTU A7 QUaNTED +105 401
#note Best play! Since Quackle is TWL06 mode, it likes 4H QUANT 48 points the best which I was originally going to play. However, I remembered the other lane ALL created and since DAS is now good, I served Tim this heartbreaker.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ABFIORV -  +0 329
#note Tim challenged in desperation. For 105 points and his remaining letters, I don't blame him.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AY K4 YA +23 424
#note 2nd best play. I somehow missed K4 AY and did K4 YA. Oh well. The last three plays were genius!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (FRABIOV) +30 454
#note Tim played much better the score indicated. He won't be encountering any of these miracle sequences in the bottom division at the BAT!
