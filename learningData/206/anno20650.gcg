>JD: AEFGKNO 8D KENAF +34 34
#note this would turn out to be one hell of a game! KENAF very nearly sims better at 8H due to the K being harder to underlap, I believe.
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: ALL H8 .ALL +7 7
>JD: ADGINOO I9 GOO +15 49
#note not a great play, ADIN doesn't really bingo very much, and I wanted to try to retain an open board. GOODIE at E3 looks nice

#note andrea overdrew, and I threw back an S - but she had another waiting!
>JD: AGIOSTZ 9C ZIG +35 180
#note missed opportunity here not to have played GROSZ at J10 setting up GROSZE? I didn't know andrea's game very well, so I decided to play it safe.

#note I really didn't want to leave O8 open, but quackle prefers CLOUD at M2 on a sim. The R is very valuable at this stage. that said, I like my choice given that I have a big rating edge.

#note 40% to win, supposedly
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: EHR 4L H.. +12 281
>JD: CDEELOS F10 CO.D +21 283
#note she's clearly close to a bingo. this play actually cuts her bingo percentage from 8% to 3% or so, so an ideal blocking play that also scores a little and sets up a lane for my S. BUT the big decision here was whether to try RECLOSED* for 88 or not. In retrospect I would like to have gone for it, but again I didn't have a good sense of Andrea's word knowledge.
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: AEEINRT O8 .ETAINER +79 360
#note uhoh
>JD: EEILQSV N12 QI +24 307
#note an unideal IQV draw
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: ABH 10K BAH +12 372
>JD: EEILSSV 14F SLIEVES +80 387
#note a miracle draw to get close, if I draw the X or blank I could pull it off!
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: ?AAIITX -  +0 372
#note at the time I couldn't believe she challenged, but other than TRIAXIAL she has no winning plays at all! the board is so constricted that she cannot score enough to catch me. thus, a reasonable challenge on her part...
>JD: DIOOTVW 4D VOW +27 414
#note all I have to do to seal the win is to block triaxial! I was worried about her catching me on spread, but really she has no good scoring plays whatsoever. I made my play hoping to bait her into ignoring TRIAXIAL by giving her a scoring play, but really I just need to block!! best is VODOUN.
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: ?AAIITX C2 aTAXIA +36 408
#note she should take row 15 first and save an X play for next turn.
>JD: DIOT 15G OD +20 434
>Andrea_Ross-Greene: I B10 .I. +6 414
#note I underscored VOW by 10 points so I only had this as a 6-point win!!
