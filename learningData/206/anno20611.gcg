>Shannon_Burns: HLOUY F7 U.HOLY +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CILPPS 12A CLIPP. +36 68
#note Tricky bingo. This is also phony, but I thought there was a reasonable chance it was good. Maybe he would think the same thing.
>Shannon_Burns: AIRU A8 AURI. +21 35
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFGIRS C3 FRIGA.eS +74 142
#note I assumed there would be limited bingos with this rack, so I didn't hesitate much when I saw FRIGATES. I really ought to know INGRAFT 100% since RAFTING and FARTING are common -ING words. mISGRAF(T)/ISoGRAF(T) also play for more points than this.
>Shannon_Burns: ?CEEIOT 4B E.ECTIOn +70 105
>Matthew_Larocque: AFMNRVX H1 FAV.R +33 175
#note I played this without much debate, it really cleans my rack up for good points and keeps the flexible X. Sim concurs it's best by far.
>Shannon_Burns: DEEIORS 1H .ORESIDE +89 194
#note Shannon had the right rack to capitalize, though, and suddenly my lead is completely gone.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIJMNOX 5H .EJOIN +27 202
#note This is probably too reckless, but it does play off the J while setting up more X spots. Still, a simple play like JO(T) keeps me neck-and-neck without offering easy points. Sim says I'm only at 43% to win vs 54-55% for JO(T). Significant mistake.
>Shannon_Burns: DDO 6J ODD +24 218
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEMNQX 4L BENE +28 230
#note This felt like a forced play, but it sets up another overlap that would also block my corner X spot. I'm pretty much relying on Shannon to have a bad rack. I'm not sure why I didn't play BEEN instead, it makes his potential counterplays less good. Sim agrees but the Q is going to slow me down.
>Shannon_Burns: ANU 11E U.NA +16 234
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEMQTX 12H MAXED +43 273
#note Far too easy for him to bingo here. He told me I blocked SULKING.
>Shannon_Burns: GIKLNSU O3 L.UKIN +30 264
#note Argh, I didn't like this word at all, but it bailed me out of the Q. Had to take the compromise.
>Matthew_Larocque: IOOOQRT N7 QI +24 297
#note Except I had QI/AMI which I somehow overlooked since I was so focused on his phony while I was holding.
>Shannon_Burns: ABEGLSS 10H BAGLESS +73 337
#note This, on the other hand, I actually thought was valid. I didn't even hold. I should have considered that winning would be pretty hard if this stays and made a desperation challenge. It's not always so easy for me to judge these situations in the middle of a game though - and I did think the word was good while not being that far behind in score.
>Matthew_Larocque: OOORTTW 2K ROTO +20 317
#note Under 8% chance - I mean I thought I had a better chance than THAT after ROTO.
>Shannon_Burns: AEH 9I HAE +24 361
>Matthew_Larocque: AGOTVWZ 2F ZO. +32 349
#note Too busy looking for my best play instead of his best play.
>Shannon_Burns: AEIMNRT 13I MINER +41 402
>Matthew_Larocque: AGTVW 7I AW +19 368
#note TWA, same spot.
>Shannon_Burns: AT B9 TA +11 413
>Shannon_Burns:  (GTV) +14 427
#note I don't feel too bad though, Shannon was due to win some games against me after I won four in a row in our first four meetings.
