>Andrew_Fisher: CIORTUV I3 VICTOR +22 22
#note I did think of the possibility of FAVOURITE here, but didn't reckon on just playing FAVOUR which sims pretty well. Here it isn't great to keep the U, so maybe VROU/FAR

>Andrew_Fisher: ADGLPSU 1E PULA +27 196
#note PULA ends up simming best or thereabouts, but disposing of the G is virtually as good (AGLU better than GULA). PUGIL M9 is another contender

#note TWOER would have been slightly better for Peter, making the game even tighter. Here I was concerned about easy sevens in column F, but the floaters of NIDGETS are also dangerous (hence YARER or YE in row 13 work well).

#note At first sight the raft of vowels is horrifying, but it does mean that Peter is starved of them. And there is a good resource, as it happens

#note An obscure out with BLUDE will not avail him
