>Mark_Peltier: AEINSST --  -66 0
#note Mark shuffled for about 5-6 minutes, but he wasn't able to remember any of the anagrams here. TISANES might be the most normal word here unless you think NASTIES is a commonly used word in conversation. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AABGILN 8D BAALING +76 76
#note I was faced with a strange situation. After Mark used up so much time and still didn't find anything, exchanging would seem like the obvious choice. But his rack is so strong, he's gonna bingo no matter what I do (or don't do). Now, I would never in a million years play *BAALING in a game versus anyone. But, given Mark's rack, I thought there would be a small chance that he lets this go and trades bingos. Crazy enough to work?
>Mark_Peltier: AEINSST I3 STANI.ES +61 61
#note ;) 
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIINO 3C IODINE. +18 94
#note This plays for 29 vertically. I think I was taking advantage of Mark using up so much time in two turns. Bad miss.
>Mark_Peltier: UUU -UUU +0 61
>Matthew_Larocque: CIMMOPT 2A COMMIT +43 137
#note I was happy with this find. But Quackle has to ruin everything - POT(A)MIC, a word I didn't know, scores 52.
>Mark_Peltier: ETTW H1 TW.ET +32 93
>Matthew_Larocque: CFGKLPY F6 FL.CK +32 169
#note P(A)CKLY scores 2 more points and gets rid of one more letter, but I didn't know that word either.
>Mark_Peltier: ERU A1 E.RU +21 114
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GPSUY 11C YUPS +33 202
#note Partial rack.
>Mark_Peltier: AE E5 AE +9 123
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAGIRT C11 .AG +14 216
#note One bingo here, worth only 59 but sure wish I had found it!
>Mark_Peltier: LX D10 L.X +38 161
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIORT 14B AIRbOAT +74 290
#note Or AVIATOR.
>Mark_Peltier: AFV -  +0 161
#note Mark challenged. Bonus!
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEELOR 15H OLDER +27 317
#note ERODE sets up hooks I don't want, which is why I went with OLDER and kept the worse leave.
>Mark_Peltier: AEFV 14K FAVE +27 188
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIIPT 15N HI +20 337
#note Not taking any chances.
>Mark_Peltier: OOUVY -OOUVY +0 188
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEINPT G12 NE.P +16 353
#note Unsure what to play. I just wanted to score decently and maybe he doesn't know POLDER. As it is, the board isn't too friendly for scoring so no reason for me to change that.
>Mark_Peltier: Q 7H Q. +22 210
#note Mark did hold, but let it go.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINTUZ L12 TZ.. +26 379
#note I like (MO)UND, but I also have limited places for the Z so perhaps it is best to take the 26 points here for TZ(AR). 
>Mark_Peltier: BHO J10 HOB +29 239
>Matthew_Larocque: DDEINRU K9 DENI +25 404
#note I very nearly played (U)RD to muck up that line, but decided that I was giving up a lot of points. I don't think I really saw the consequences of this - it sets up TWO bingo lines. Bad play. I still have (MO)UND!
>Mark_Peltier: GINORSU B4 SOURING +66 305
#note Of course, I beat myself up for not playing (U)RD.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADRRUY 15A AY +20 424
#note Sim likes (SHE)RRY or just R(AX). I'd go with the first one, try and end the game quicker.
>Mark_Peltier: EEEOOVW A8 OE +14 319
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DJRRU 13I Jo +24 448
>Mark_Peltier: EEOVW M9 WOVE +20 339
>Matthew_Larocque: DRRU 5B .RR. +4 452
#note My time ran out, there's like 15 plays better than this. You'd think I could have at least played R(AX).
>Mark_Peltier: E E11 .E +14 353
>Mark_Peltier:  (DU) +6 359
#note I was a little careless on some plays, but thanks to *BAALING, I was able to counter Mark's strong opening rack. That alone might have changed the whole outcome of the game. Never again.
