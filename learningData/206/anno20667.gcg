>Quackle: ?BCEIJO 10F JE. +26 26
#note Naive logic would suggest JOE or JIAO, but this does go to the top of the sim. Maybe because it's more defensive against sevens containing S? Even though I just drew seven? They're all close, anyway (valuation of BCEI? only 0.3 better than BCIO?)
>Bill: BHIQRYY 7E YIR.H +16 94
#note This should be really strong considering that I'm about 85% likely to draw a U on any given turn against Quackle, except I forgot that that percentage drops to zero when I'm holding a Q.
>Quackle: ?BCINOO 9G B.ONOmIC +73 99
#note So after possibly playing -S defense last turn, let's sacrifice two points to set up an -S hook in a triple lane. I don't get it.
>Bill: AABENQY 8A BANYA +47 141
>Quackle: AEINOSX 5F SI.OXANE +80 179
>Bill: EEIQRTU L1 QUER. +48 189
#note Ok, I guess the chance isn't 0% that I'll draw a U with a Q. It's just that if I do, Quackle will block the spot with a bingo.
>Quackle: ADEEMTU C7 U.TEAMED +76 255
>Bill: ?EEIOTU 1L .UIT +39 228
>Quackle: ACGILNS O9 SCALING +95 350
#note Oh, so it's one of those games against Quackle where it will just draw itself consecutive bingos until the game is out of reach. In other words, any game against Quackle.

#note sure
>Bill: DEGPRRS 10B P.R +11 327
#note Quackle says I shouldn't bother going for a bingo, because it knows what letters it's going to draw for me.
>Quackle: EFOPTVV K8 P.OVE +20 445
>Bill: DEGORSW 2J GO.RD +30 357
#note Missed WOG and didn't know DESCALING. 0.4% win percentage down the drain.
