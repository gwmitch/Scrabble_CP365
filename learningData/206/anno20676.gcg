>Matthew_Larocque: BDEEJRT 8G JET +20 20
#note Sucks that I can't do anything better with the J.
>Shannon_Burns: EIV J6 VIE +25 25
>Matthew_Larocque: BBDEQRX -BBDQ +0 20
#note Yeah, okay. I'll keep the X because I like the X.
>Shannon_Burns: AEFU 6G FAU.E +11 36
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGGLRX 5K REX +24 44
#note If he takes this spot, I can probably still hit him back and keep it even. The two gees stink pretty bad though.
>Shannon_Burns: DEHR 4L HERD +39 75
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DGGLNO 3M DO +30 74
#note They sure do. Plus I missed LODGING, which set this game down a bad path. Really, who misses ING bingos anyways? It's like the very first thing you learn how to do in Scrabble. Whoamygod - ING, incoming bingo in the next 5 turns.
>Shannon_Burns: CRU O1 CUR. +25 100
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGGILN 7J .GG +9 83
#note Ugh. I should have just tried SNIGGLE. It just sounded like a word that would be in the Scrabble dictionary. NEGLIGE GINGELI, it's hard to find bingos when they don't end in ING.
>Shannon_Burns: AELSV L7 .AVELS +22 122
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILLNT 12E TELLINg. +58 141
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILLNT --  -58 83
#note Phony anagram of a valid bingo - and I saw LINTLESS too, shouldn't I try that instead anyways? there's a bunch of other stuff too but let's just pretend this didn't happen.
>Shannon_Burns: AM 10J MA. +11 133
#note He wanted to make sure I couldn't play LENTILS.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EILLNT 11I NIL. +16 99
#note I'm sure glad I lost this game, because there's no justice winning like this.
>Shannon_Burns: DEIINOT 9B EDITION +73 206
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AELRTU 12D vAULTER +71 170
#note I knew about SEDITION, but missed SALUTER. True story. I don't even think I knew ESTRUAL. 
>Shannon_Burns: Y M3 ...Y +15 221
>Matthew_Larocque: NOQSSTW A5 TOWNS +33 203
#note But I'm gifted an S after Shannon goes for the fish. Really, that's just stupid.
>Shannon_Burns: OTU H12 .OUT +12 233
>Matthew_Larocque: BHKPQSY E11 Y.K +20 223
#note Fishing for QOPHS or QI/QI. Quackle swats away my logic in favor of K(A)PH to fish for QI/QI or some S play on the TWS.
>Shannon_Burns: ?CEEINS 15E CEN.IlES +60 293
#note He looked for awhile but couldn't come up with the higher scoring plays.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABHPQSZ B4 BAH +31 254
#note Firepower is getting a little heavy, have to hope I still have places to unload them.
>Shannon_Burns: GILOO C3 LOGOI +28 321
>Matthew_Larocque: FOPQRSZ 14F FO. +29 283
#note I played this too fast - he gave me a spot for FOP which is way better - I need more turnover.
>Shannon_Burns: ABRW D1 BRAW +42 363
#note Also, that was painful. FOP would have made a huge difference.
>Matthew_Larocque: IPQRSTZ 8D QI +44 327
>Shannon_Burns: MO 10B MO +23 386
>Matthew_Larocque: ADPRSTZ 14K DAP +11 338
#note He's gonna block, but I have to try and he is low on time (under a minute I think).
>Shannon_Burns: AEIINNP 12L .AE +3 389
>Matthew_Larocque: AERSTZ N9 RAZ.ES +48 386
#note BRAZES scores 51.
>Shannon_Burns: IINNP 5F NIP +14 403
>Matthew_Larocque: T 3C ..T +3 389
#note I went overtime after he blocked ZETAS. Otherwise, JOT. 
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IN) +4 393
#note Fumbled that middle section pretty bad, wish I had played SNIGGLE but it's easy to say a lot of things in hindsight.
