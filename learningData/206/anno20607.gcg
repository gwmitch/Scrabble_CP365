>Matt_Canik: ?DEISTY H6 DEnSITY +78 78
#note DYkIEST# is better here
>Jackson_Smylie: AGO 6H .AGO +10 10
>Matt_Canik: ADLORRS 11H .ROD +10 88
#note Pretty certain that Jackson didn't have the Z or J after his last play or he'd just play them, not set them up. In a really angry, tilty rage I am so worried that Jackson will 2x2 that I decide to block everything, while missing my own 2x2s in SORORAL or ROSTRAL. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AZ 10J ZA +65 75
#note He informs me that he did, indeed, draw the Z on his 3-tile draw last turn.

>Jackson_Smylie: AEEIMNT 5I MATINEE +79 154
>Matt_Canik: AIILRRS O1 RAIL.R +21 117
#note AIRI(E)R is probably better, of the words I know. 
>Jackson_Smylie: HLOT 12J LOTH +30 184
>Matt_Canik: BGIPRSY L8 GYP +25 142
#note BI(N)GY#, GRIP(E)Y, PIGS(T)Y (making TRODS#) look good too. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AJM F10 JAM +36 220
>Matt_Canik: AABEIRS 4L BAA. +24 166
#note I don't see ARABISE#, which I have never studied but should have assumed was good. Also AIRBASE. 
>Jackson_Smylie: DINORTT 7B INTORT.D +71 291
>Matt_Canik: AEILRSX 6B XI +52 218
#note Should I play RELAXI(N)S for 80 or hold AELRS for 28 fewer points? Q loves my play. 
>Jackson_Smylie: INOQU 2J QUINO. +70 361
#note Does jackson ever have to think about his plays or does he just score 70 every turn
>Matt_Canik: ?AELRSU D2 bALUS.ER +76 294
>Matt_Canik: CEEFNRS (challenge) +5 299
#note Does what I want to the board - opens marginal lines at C and 3 that Jackson will have to block for the rest of the tame, while making it difficuld to also address 14.

>Jackson_Smylie: EIW A12 WI.E +42 436
>Matt_Canik: BCDHKOV 3B CH.V +24 404
#note I think this is what I had? I have to draw the S for BOSK and Jackson has to miss SCHAV, I think, for me to win this game.
