#note i suspected this was a horrible move. my friend Victor, who's never played a competitive Scrabble game in his life, but was watching, told me I should have played B6 PLAGUE at the end of the game. wow, that looks a lot better. PLAGUER maybe better than that. (-17) I guessed right, I said at least a 15-pt equity loss on this.. Victor play Scrabble already!!

#note well, i was likely to lose even if I do plaguer since she had the blank. however the point is when drawing poorly to find everything. if i studied i would know swainish.

#note creating another bingo lane is crucial here, as weak as this is.

#note unfortunately unwinnable. I figured out that a C would give me friction/noritic but then if i do 12K LIN she gets requite/quieter, and there was no way to not set her up for that. if only the L was one down i'd have a 12.5% chance at winning. then I ran out of time and hope she mistracked somehow.
