#note this was a difficult choice. if I play FA at I13, I leave myself a hot spot for ZA that could stay open for many turns. I chose LUTZ because Ed's plays to date suggested he was close to a bingo, and LUTZ seemed to block the most of any of the play choices (against a random rack, it drops his bingo percentage from 18% to 13%). The top-simming play is FAT by a point. I like my choice.

#note ups my bingo percentage to 35%, which is not great but better than any alternatives

>JD: AACEIRU 3L EAU +16 182
#note I'm far enough down that I shouldn't be playing EAU here. I liked the fact that it prevented Ed from scoring cheap points, and still left some bingo lanes, but it doesn't make up the 16 extra points I get for playing UREMIC.

>JD: ACEHIRR 5F CHAR.ER +45 227
#note well, that's embarassing - I was thinking of CHARRIER but completely forgot that CHARIER is a word...also CHA(LUTZ) > CHARGER!

>JD: BGIIOOU 14L BIO +27 254
#note I can play BIOG now but I liked saving the hook, and saving -ING on row 2
>Ed_de_Guzman: AEILN O6 ELAIN +20 318
>JD: AGIOPRU I7 U.O +12 266
#note a weird play, I didn't know what to do. I really want to keep -ING for row 2, so no GIGA or RUGA. quackle's suggestion of POUR looks good for a few more points.

#note MILO looks like the play, creating a nice lane on column A

#note missed a great opportunity that quackle comes up with - TONED at 15E to create a scary new lane (although ed can block). this is a terrible setup...
