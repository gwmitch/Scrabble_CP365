>Joshua_Sokol: CDDEEOP H4 COPED +26 26
#note Welcome to game 1 of my last TWL06 tournament! I had every reason to play this word with the C on the star here. I chose the boring option
>Michael_Fagen: AEFLRTU I7 TEARFUL +69 69
#note took him a while to play this. He would have no bingo if I played the more defensive COPED, except for CRATEFUL+! REFUTAL was the anagram, neither of us was sure of FAULTER. I knew there was something weird about this alphagram.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEIOT 4H .ODEIA +18 44
#note I don't usually fear that Michael will close the board on me. Otherwise I could play A(L)ODIA or A(C)EDIA because I don't want to depend on drawing an S soon. (C)OATI is also nice, but I slightly prefer AT to ADE here as well as the extra points.
>Michael_Fagen: AJW 3I JAW +46 115
#note this was bad news bears!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINOST 5J OE +20 64
#note Unless I convinced myself that there had to be something I was forgetting. EEINORST is a rack I am familiar with. Somehow, in this game, the alphagram didn't click with me. It's a good thing I didn't lose much from not seeing ONERIEST and SEROTINE. This had better be the last time I miss something so high prob!
>Michael_Fagen: AIL 11I .AIL +14 129
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIINST M3 D.INTIES +72 136
#note considering the previous play of FAIL, this is by all means the right bingo to play.
>Michael_Fagen: AMSU L8 MAU.S +31 160
>Joshua_Sokol: BHHIORX G7 HOB +29 165
#note I'm not sure why I didn't consider G7 BOX. I did want to keep the X for either M12 HEX or 8L (MI)XT next turn though. I think this is a better play than BOX but I didn't consider it.
>Michael_Fagen: ORSY 10F SOR.Y +40 200
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHIRXZ 13E BEZI. +26 191
>Michael_Fagen: EFK 14D KEF +35 235
#note this play really hurt...
>Joshua_Sokol: AHNNRVX 8L ..NX +39 230
#note especially combined with this draw
>Michael_Fagen: ?OQRTTU 15F TORQUe +48 283
#note And Michael had the chance to completely decimate me with one play here! 15A QUOiT looks better than this, but 15B QUiTTOR is a killer.
>Joshua_Sokol: AHNRRTV 12H H.RT. +29 259
>Michael_Fagen: MY 14J MY +27 310
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGNRV 15A VENA +31 290
#note EGR is actually quite the improvement on EGN here, since ING words are near impossible to draw, and there are three N's to come.
>Michael_Fagen: DOT 12D TOD +21 331
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGILNR 11C GEL +22 312
#note This game is a very telling example of how important seeing high prob 8s is.
>Michael_Fagen: IV C9 VI. +11 342
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EINOPR 5A PEcORIN. +68 380
#note But then again, seeing lower prob 8s is also important. 
>Michael_Fagen: EEIINTU -  +0 342
#note If Michael wanted to win here, he could have played 3M (D)UI, giving him a very decent chance of bingoing next turn. Instead, he thought his best shot was challenging. I have been phonying Michael a lot lately, so that was a good call.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGLNRS A4 S.RANG +30 410
#note I know he doesn't have a bingo, since he took a while to challenge. So I should empty the bag here if I can.
>Michael_Fagen: EEIINTU O6 NI.IE +12 354
#note -3 to N10 ETUI
>Joshua_Sokol: AACGLW D2 AGL.W +18 428
>Michael_Fagen: ETU N1 UTE +9 363
>Michael_Fagen:  (AC) +8 371
#note I pulled this win out of my ass, for lack of a more appropriate thing to say.
