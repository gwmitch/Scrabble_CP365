>bingoboy: EEIIILS 5G ILEI.IS +7 33
#note This is an ISC game, I just wanted to play ILEITIS. In a tournament, I would always trade EII. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AALNNUU 4K .AUL +14 84
#note Quackle likes ANNU(L) H1 or ANNUAL 4B. 
>bingoboy: DEEEGMX 3M MEG +24 57
#note Scared of SAULT. This sims the best, despite setting up a potentially dangerous 2J-2N line. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AAFNNUU 2I FAUNA +16 100
#note Scores two more at 4C. 4C spot sims 1.4% better.

#note Not sure why this wasn't played at 1G.

>bingoboy: ?AEIIOT 7K .AOI +10 279
#note This was an interesting play, but in my mind it was very sound. I'm holding the last I and a blank, the pool is very consonant heavy. I feel fairly confident I will draw a bingo. NAOI sets up a 62 point Q spot that he will likely block if he doesn't have the Q. and if he DOES have the Q, which is somewhat likely after be played 6 tiles off, he will play QI 6N and leave the three bingo lines (11G, 14F, 13D) all open for me. I thought this was an awesome play, and 1000 iterations on a many-ply sim agrees with me. NAOI wins 93.1% of the time, next best option wins only 84% of the time. Yay!
>Jackson_Smylie: AHLMNPR 14F HALM +33 309
#note After NAOI, it is safe to assume I am holding ?I. That being established, HM 6N wins 45% of the time, whereas the next best option wins just 13%. He said immediatly after he hit enter for HALM he realized he should have blocked 6N. 
>bingoboy: ?AEINTW 11G vAWNTIE +70 349
#note vAWNTIE avoids all potential for a Q stick. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ACGNOPR L10 P.CARO +22 331
#note The game was lost to him, though, and it was ISC, so he threw in the towel. 

However, He has a play that will lose by just three points. What was it?
