#note One of three bad plays in this game, along with missing the bingo and not clearing out the junk with ANKH. However, 5J V(E)G/NRSZ? 7 is 3rd in the sim, after 3I GR(O)SZ 34/NV? and exchange GNRV/SZ?. I'm surprised it's that high, since it blocks the E, is unhookable, and has a consonant heavy leave. There are still 4 E's and 6 more vowels in the pool, though. I saw GR(O)SZ and considered it but was scared he would hook it. Now I realize I needed to (1) not block the E and ruin the bingo lane with VEG and (2) create a new E (or Y) hook with GROSZ.  I envisioned the worst happening at one of those two spots. But I needed to take the risk and take the points. I'm behind so much, so why not?

>Liz: ?BNRRSZ 3I BR. +8 215
#note If I hadn't blocked the E, I would have had BRONZERS! But where are  the vowels? I haven't seen one for three turns already. Quackle likes spending the blank with 3I BR(O)NZeR 40.
>Quackle: AEE K11 EA.E +37 391
#note That's where the vowels are!  And Matt gets 37 points out of AEE; pretty neat.

#note Until this occurs.

>Liz: ?GNRSUW 3I ...WN +20 298
#note Quackle prefers I9 (X)U/GNRSW? for 14; I have no idea why. I'd rather get 20 points and keep a vowel, even if it is a U. BROWN also opens a lane.
