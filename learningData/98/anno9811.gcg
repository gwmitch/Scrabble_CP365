#note this sims ok, but Q prefers row 14 plays REAVAIL, LARVAE, RIVAL - which I didn't like.  3k RA(K)I is also rated highly

#note this is 1.5% win behind 1L HO(W)E. which scores 16 more and creates rather than blocks a bingo line. i prefer HOWE.

#note this play i dont like.  it blocks that floating N which I might need.   I considerd 13H/I plays but didn't have the S and didnt want to make that line - but I'm behind and there is already an S spot under ZA, so my reasoning was poor.   Also simming well with the row 13 plays is (JA)CINTHE  for 40 - not sure about the value of that.
