#note H1 P(EWE)E is 4 points better, but this will also win.
>Hildebrand: ?AI 4M I.s +20 417
#note 5B ItA# is the most points, and I spotted it, but not wanting to give up, I played just two tiles hoping Adam would play a phony two or something crazy.

#note So I turned a 3 point loss into a 20 point loss, big deal.
