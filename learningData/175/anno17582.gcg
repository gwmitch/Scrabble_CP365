#note Darn! I saw all the L10 V?Z?R plays would lose to M12 ARE, but I couldn't think of making the blank a Y for VIZY, which ties - not only that, I thought for a fleeting moment I had plays like C3 VAPORIZE or VALORIZE, but didn't think to move the Z around and find VIZORING. I think I had something like 4 minutes left at this point, which should be enough to keep cool and spot those things.
