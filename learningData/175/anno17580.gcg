#note At first I was worried about plays like N10 ZOEAE, and then I realized there were no O's left, so I looked elsewhere. Still, I missed 5B GENIP. This still scored pretty well while retaining the nice ING. The Rs were also gone, and I didn't know LIEVES#,  so I thought this was solid defensively as well.

#note Interesting position! To me the options were this and D12 DUNK. Other competitors include 5J LANK, D9 KANZU, and 6B ZEK. I went with ODAL here for these reasons -  at the very least, the Z setup will mature into a legitimate threat after my 3 tile draw the vast majority of the time, and will be very difficult for Adam to block while also scoring anything. So the decreased score of this play will often be a nonissue as Adam makes a similar sacrifice to block. Another advantage of ODAL is that it is a slight hedge against Q draws - many times when I draw the Q, I will also draw one of the two remaining I's along with it, which will allow me to play QUIZ if Adam elects to block the Z. Lastly, I don't expect to be able to get past Adam here without taking a little bit of a chance - now felt like the time to go for it, as opposed to just continuing to remain behind a tempo until eventually losing the game. The great thing about D12 DUNK (and LUNK, but DUNK is better for points alone) is that the opportunities for the K with the ALNZ leave are really good. I can draw KANZU or KAIZEN# a lot, and it blocks the U if Adam is already holding the Q. Still, Adam will hold QADI 2B a lot here, and if he already has the U and I miss out on drawing IE, I'll probably be forced to make a similar play to this one on my subsequent turn. It's nice how many letters make a hard-to-block Z setup there on this board! (D, A#, L#)

#note This is one of two wins. The better one is 11D UNKEND, following with L1 (SMA)ZE or ZEA.
