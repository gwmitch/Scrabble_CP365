>Richard_Spence: FJMSTUW -FMJUW +0 0
#note Game 1 of the Boston Area Tournament EB - CSW division. I am still brand new to Collins, so I'm undoubtedly going to miss a lot of 3's and up.
>Marty_Gabriel: EVX 8G VEX +26 26
>Richard_Spence: EIIOOST 7H OO +15 15
#note Exchanging last turn was a decent move, although not when you can't do anything next turn.
>Marty_Gabriel: UY 9I YU +26 52
>Richard_Spence: EGIIJST 6F JET +29 44
#note I wasn't sure about GOE#...
>Marty_Gabriel: ?AEEHIR K6 HEApIER +73 125
#note Interestingly, HEAPY is good in TWL but HEAPIER/HEAPIEST are #.
>Richard_Spence: ?DGIISW 6J W.IG +19 63
#note Missed WIDGIeS. Not sure if that qualifies as a "missed play." WHIG is the best TWL play.
>Marty_Gabriel: EELW 8K .WEEL +36 161
>Richard_Spence: ?ADIKSU 12H KAU.I +28 91
#note "Missing" DIqUA(R)KS#.
>Marty_Gabriel: FHIRST N1 FRITHS +42 203
>Richard_Spence: ?CDMORS 1K COR.S +33 124
>Richard_Spence: ?CDMORS --  -33 91
#note A legitimate mistake here (only CORVES is good). Should've known CORF does not take an S. On top of that I missed SCOMbR(I)D but that would've been a tough find.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEEINST 13C ETESIAN +77 280
>Richard_Spence: ?CDMORS E7 COMRaD.S +74 165
#note Or SCROMeD#/ANS#. But I'm a CSW noob.
>Marty_Gabriel: IQ M3 QI +46 326
>Richard_Spence: ABPTUVY H12 ..VA +33 198
#note (KA)VA is the best of the TWL choices; YU(F)T# is better.
