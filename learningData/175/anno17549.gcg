#note Why would I make a valid play when I can play a phoney that gets rid of GUPW while scoring more than any available option?

#note I know he has ADOU, which means he has a U, which greatly increases his chances of hitting a 2J play here. But wait, how much does it actually change his chances? He'd need a T, an S, or the right combination of another vowel and another consonant. Even then, those plays offer me big counter opportunities if I pick up a big-point tile. Let's go.

#note Pool's consonant-heavy so I'm not as worried about holding AO. I saw BOOZY, but this holds AZO which will allow me to keep scoring on a board that is not good for that right now, in a game situation where I just need to outrun a bingo to win.
