>Jim_Burlant: ACFINPY 8D FANCY +34 34
#note Round 1.  Having not played a tournament since the late 1990's, Ed came into this tournament rated 1705 and was an unknown quantity to most of us.  As for this - this was an autopilot mistake, as I rushed this.  After the game I recognized the mistake:  I'd missed PACIFY at 8G for 40,  which definitely should have been the play.  But I benefit from this.
>Ed_Cunningham: ?BEINTT 7H BETTINg +67 67
#note Had I played at 8G like I should have, he'd be hitting ABETTINg for 80 and I'd be 5 points deeper in the hole.
>Jim_Burlant: DDFGIIP M2 PIDGI. +20 54
#note Little did I know that racks like this were going to be the order of the day for me.  Best is a play I didn't know - E4 GIDDAP.  This is a reasonable runner up in the sim.  Just shy of 34% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: DGI N1 GID +21 88
>Jim_Burlant: DEFQRSW 6L Q. +22 76
#note It's either this or exchanging FQW.  As much as I hate keeping FW, I can't justify turning down 22 points.  WAFER is also a reasonable choice.  
>Ed_Cunningham: ENORRW D8 .ROWNER +26 114
>Jim_Burlant: DEFHRSW 15A FRESH +51 127
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Couldn't think of SHREWD, which scores 6 more and unloads the W.  I saw HEWS and this and opted for this due to turnover even though it kept the W.  While the F is no prize, it's less putrid than the W.  SHREWD really needed to be the play. 
>Ed_Cunningham: EY E10 YE +25 139
>Jim_Burlant: DELNUVW 13A UNW.D +18 145
#note My last turn was a bit of a mistake but this one's on target.  This is definitely best.  43% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: AAT G7 A.TA +18 157
>Jim_Burlant: EILMMOV 4I MOVE. +22 167
#note Irritated when the last tile came out as the second M; I was hoping for an O for a sweet MOVIEOLA at E1.  Not much else to choose from here - this is best.  44-1/2% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: OZ J2 ZO. +32 189
>Jim_Burlant: DGIIKLM 5E KILIM +28 195
#note It didn't occur to me that, if I didn't play on the double-word, I could score more.  This word scores 2 more points if I play it one column further to the right.  39% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: ?ABIRSU C10 BA +18 207
#note Actual rack - he told me post-mortem he wasn't sure about AIRBUS so he opted for caution.  His best plays here are H10 AIRBUS and 6A URBIA.  14D RUB for 18 is also good.  He's still in good shape at 76% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGNOSV H10 DOVENS +45 240
#note Or DEVONS in the same location.  59% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: ?AALRU 6B AURA +12 219
#note He told me afterwards he had the L and was gambling that I didn't have one.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGLNT A5 ELEGANT +79 319
#note Relief!  It doesn't get much better than drawing AEELNT to a G and having two places to play it (ENTANGLE is the other bingo on row 14).  Now I'm in the catbird seat - 95% to win.
>Ed_Cunningham: ?CEILSU 14G U.SLICEd +72 291
#note His best bingo is 15H SPICULES but his prospects are still bleak:  SPICULES wins 17%, and this wins 11.
>Jim_Burlant: EHILPTX 15M HEX +45 364
>Ed_Cunningham: AJOT 4D JOTA +33 324
#note As he put this down I wondered whether he was tracking the pool closely enough; I suspect JIAO might have been a bit better for him here given the pool.
>Jim_Burlant: EILPRTU 11H .UTLIER +14 378
#note This isn't one of the original options, but it's one of only 3 plays that wins 100%.  I figured I was most likely to draw an O, and that I'd have outs all over the place with OP.  I was in for a surprise:
>Ed_Cunningham: AEIOOOR O1 OE +20 344
>Jim_Burlant: PS L10 S.P +10 388
#note Shocked when I saw the S as the final tile in the bag.  This or PIS in the same spot is the play.
>Jim_Burlant:  (AIOOR) +10 398
#note Outside of a mild mistake on the open that I benefitted from, overall, I'm pretty pleased with this one.  No major errors, and the only other significant equity loss came in a situation where I often struggle:  trying to process counter-overloaded racks. My mind often locks on those and I just don't see through them clearly.
