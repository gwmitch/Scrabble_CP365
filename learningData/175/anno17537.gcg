>Josh: EILRSTZ H8 ZIT +24 24
#note Let's say the traditional vertical H7 position is correct, which it probably is. I like being unorthodox because it messes with opponents that are used to rigid top-level optimalizing play. Maybe he'll think I have QI, XI or XU and bleed equity to block, who knows?
>Jason: ?AAEGIO 10D AgIO.AGE +64 64
>Josh: BEELRRS D8 BL.RE +20 44
#note I can't see anything that's possibly better than this. Can you?
>Jason: ENQUU K8 QU.EN +28 92
#note Well so long as he was playing this at K8 instead of K7 I asked him childishly why he didn't play it at K7, to which he acted like he messed up. That increased my confidence that he was setting another U up. Later he confirmed that thought, saying he didn't want to play QU(E)UE cause of all the hooks it yielded. 
>Josh: DEOPRSS 12F RESPO.DS +74 118
#note Saw DROPS(I)ES first but kept looking.
>Jason: JMOU 8A JUM.O +48 140
#note There's that U he failed to set up :P
>Josh: ?AIRSUY 8K .UAYS +54 172
#note I almost looked for a bingo here but I gathered that this was probably better anyway. F2 pYURIAS is 78.
>Jason: EFI 13G FIE +27 167
>Josh: ?DEHIOU O1 HIDEOUt. +86 258
#note I saw F2 HIDEOUs scored the same but this looks better in terms of board shaping. Jason said he would have had something if I played HIDEOUS. 
>Jason: AMRT N2 MART +27 194
>Josh: ADEFOSY C11 OFAY +27 285
#note My own coffeehousing messed me up here. I said "smart S setup" to hide the fact that I had the S, but then, since I had already almost decided to play C11 OFAY, continued and said "too bad you don't have the last S". Had I shut up, I might have seen M1 FADO or J10 (G)O(O)FY before I realized that I would telegraph my S... GOOFY has to be the right play as it takes out basically the only feasible bingo lane left.
>Jason: TTW M7 W.TT +12 206
>Josh: DEKSVWX H12 ..X +10 295
#note I drew WKVX! Finally a bad draw this game... He hasn't opened another lane so I decide to start closing everything off. DESK can wait another turn.
>Jason: EGN 4K GEN.. +12 218
>Josh: DEKSTVW 15A DESK +53 348
#note if he has a bingo this turn, I'd be quite surprised, but even if he does, I'm still ahead a bingo. This puts the game so far out of reach for Jason.
>Jason: EH 3L HE.. +25 243
#note no A? Guess not
>Josh: AINTVW L2 W..T +10 358
#note I forgot my last tile. This blocks both 7 lanes just about completely. But I can play just about anything now.
>Jason: CLO 5I CLO. +18 261
#note I think Jason gave up here
>Josh: ABDEINV B6 VA. +14 372
#note blocking TOLAR(J)EV :P
Didn't see this game him O(V)ER stuff, but it really doesn't matter. I should play AB(Y) at 14A I guess.
>Jason: IT 6J IT +12 273
>Josh: BDEINNR 9G B.N +19 391
>Jason: INV E5 VIN. +14 287
>Josh: ADEINRR 14A AN. +19 410
#note just took the points, which is finally the right thing to do 
>Jason: LP 6D L.P +11 298
>Josh: ADEIIRR 12A RI.. +8 418
#note OK so he set up a lane. I could block it, but he probably doesn't have anything and if he does, well then I'll probably bingo through it, right? I'm so greedy...
>Jason: ACEGILR G1 GLACIER +68 366
#note surprise! scored as 67
>Josh: ADEINOR 1A READIN. +33 451
#note oh come on, I didn't draw into anything even though I have the most probably rack in the game? bleh... let's just say I was being nice
>Jason: EO A8 .OE +10 376
>Jason:  (O) +2 378
