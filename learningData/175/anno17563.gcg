#note I'm going to do my best annotating Oregon Tile 2014! I finally feel organized enough during tournament play to record racks so here goes...
>Tom: AADQRTU H1 QUADRAT. +110 110
#note As always, i feel like i'm going to go 0-16 (or however many games the tourneys are) right before they start. I'd won 13 of 14 first games before this, but after this play it started to feel like i'd have to face psychological pressure this tourney for realz. Lets see how I deal with it (spoiler: not well)
>Chris: ADEIKLU 5C DUIKE. +22 52
#note I didn't know QUADRATED, so this play sims like 16th or something. KAURI and a couple other non-QUADRATED plays are better too. I think I was rattled by his big opening bingo and wanted turnover so I could be comforted by drawing a blank and a decent score to stay in touch with him. I also briefly considered QUADLIKE* lolz.
>Tom: ARX 4B RAX +41 151
>Chris: ?AELNOW 7H .OWpLANE +62 114
#note I knew that LOW A3 (the sim winner) was the best play, but I again wanted the comfort of getting more scoreboard points and the comfort of getting a bingo down. I find it much harder to pass up bingoes live than online, At least this was the only bingo; I looked at DOWN + ?ALE forever.
>Tom: ?EENORS O1 ENdORS.E +122 273
#note Scrabble is fun for everyone.
>Chris: AAEGHOZ G3 ZO.A +49 163
#note Cue the comeback? Here we gooooooo!
>Tom: BFO 3A FOB +30 303
>Chris: ABEHJOR 7C HAJ +31 194
#note I think this was my rack. I saw HAJ first and didnt see JOB but they seem equivalentish.
>Tom: IOTU 1H .UOIT +15 318
#note Well, I'm glad this blocked SCORABLE*, otherwise I may have lost a turn lol. Wouldn't have played it without looking elsewhere though and would've likely seen the bingo I played haha.
>Chris: ABCEORS 9I BORACES +75 269
#note I thought it was ACERBOSE* and was mad I had the A instead of the E. ACARBOSE is clearly the best play here since it adds the right kind of volatility to the game. 
>Tom: EGL 9C LEG +22 340
>Chris: CDGHLNT N9 .CHT +15 284
#note Thought of C(A)T(C)H, ECHT, and various exchanges. I like ECHT since it keeps me in bingo range better, sets up an S hook, and if he takes the O lane, he might give me bingoes occaaaasionaly lol
>Tom: ADIP 10G PAID +22 362
#note Get money get paiiid xD
>Chris: DGILNNU H10 .UDING +30 314
#note Briefly thought of 10% phonying with DUNLING C11 hehe. 10% phonying is when you're 10% sure its good but you think the situation calls for a phony :P. Also, he held this. He said he knew AUDINGS but was unsure if it was good without the S. If he challenged, my comeback plan may have been successful haha.
>Tom: GIOTV 14D VOTI.G +12 374
#note He reverts to blocking mode and consequently I start to think about faking fishing and going for the outscoring route. It's worked for me in the past :P
>Chris: INPTY 12K NIT.Y +24 338
#note Only have a partial rack here :(
>Tom: EEELR 12C REELE. +14 388
#note Yess only 14 points. Suddenly I feel like i'm in range...
>Chris: ELMNNPS I3 PES +41 379
#note Considered PES and YLEM, leaving that spot for next turn if i draw AE. I thought he'd block it a large percentage of the time so I went for the points. My play is winning the 2-ply sim by 5% win (14 to 9), so that's something maybe?
>Tom: EIMRSTV M1 SIVER +31 419
#note He didnt have garbage so the game is over, unfortunately :(
>Chris: AFILMNN L4 FAL. +26 405
>Tom: MT J1 .M +10 429
>Chris: IMNN 11N .M +14 419
>Tom: T 5K T.. +6 435
#note Final score recorded as 418-439.
