>DynoWZ2014: ?AGIORT 8F ROATInG +68 68
#note Saw I?G and immediately though of suffix - ING. Didn't take too long to find ROATInG.

Quackle suggested ORGIAsT. Same score but at least the s is in between the double letter scores, unlike my O.
>Quackle: AEEILLN I8 .ENAILLE +60 60
>DynoWZ2014: CEMNSUX 15D EXCUS. +48 116
#note Saw15D EXCUS(E) for a triple word.

Best word :D
>Quackle: AAAEOOO -AAAOOO +0 60
>DynoWZ2014: AEIIIMN G7 M.I +9 125
#note Too many Is! Saw G7 M(O)I but it was not a good word.

Never heard of 14A IMINE.
>Quackle: ACEELPS 12D ESPEC.AL +80 140
>DynoWZ2014: AEHIIKN D9 HIK. +11 136
#note Wanted to get rid of HIK so I played D9 HIK(E).

Quackle suggested 11C KHI which was also good.
>Quackle: ABDEMPT 11I .BAMP +30 170
>DynoWZ2014: ?AEGINS N8 tEASING +80 216
#note BINGO! ING and S? way too good. So many possibilities. PLayed N8 tEASING because the t was next to triple word so less points and possibilities.

Quackle's13A ANGrIES was good but I never taught of that.
>Quackle: DDEEEST O4 DEEDEST +90 260
>DynoWZ2014: BIOORTW N2 BIO +13 229
