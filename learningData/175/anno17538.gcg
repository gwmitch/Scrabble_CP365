>Josh: AAILNNY H8 INLAY +24 24
#note 3rd highest scoring game for me ever in this game. Ready to be bedazzled by my skill (luck)?

Here I couldn't find a plausible phony 6 to get by my opponent.
>Michael: ABL G10 ALB +16 16
>Josh: ACJNOTX 10D JAC.. +20 44
#note There are plays that score here. I missed them. 10D COX(AL) or 10C COAX(AL), but the star scoring play is 11F C(LA)XON, which I can't say I knew (only KLAXON). Michael might challenge, and this sets up my J at J10 (the J's favorite column!), but there are so few options for Michael next turn that won't interfere with that setup. My setup with JAC(AL) seems better because even if Michael underlaps with an O, I can reunderlap with my T and block the most lucrative 7 lane he has. Not to mention Michael probably would have gotten rid of an O if he had one last turn. JACAL may also be challenged too. 
>Michael: ILT D10 .ILT +22 38
>Josh: ENOOTXY 14B TOYON +35 79
#note Wow! I did not know the word that my rack forms! Or maybe I did, I'm not sure... Anyways here I was, busy using the secret JILTY* hook! Exploitation level over 9000?
>Michael: DH E9 H.D +20 58
>Josh: ACEERTX 15F EXACTER +103 182
#note If you were wondering how I scored so much this game, here is the beginning of it. I didn't know the anagram of this word, EXCRETA. 
>Michael: AINPRSS -  +0 58
#note Held and challenged. Michael knew EXACTOR but not EXACTER. Now it's up to him to figure out if it takes an S or if it's just a superlative of EXACT! (hint, it's both)
>Josh: FMORSWW 8A FROWS +53 235
>Michael: AINPRSS M9 SPRAINS +87 145
#note Ballsy! He didn't know if this was good, obviously. I held it briefly just to make sure EXACTER's definition in Zyzzyva linked to EXACTOR or vice-versa.
>Josh: ADMRUWZ 15A MAW +31 266
#note I didn't know MAZ(A)RD either! I decided against ZA because keeping the Z seemed like a good idea if I could score more than 30 elsewhere and since MWURD is a really unattractive leave compared to ZURD. I stand by this decision even though I wasn't bound to draw another A. 
>Michael: HOO 7B OHO +26 171
#note While Michael was trying to figure out if he should play OHO 7B or OOH 7A, the same decision (plus two points and extra threat) at L10 or L11 was trying to get his attention. Maybe people really do have trouble with vertical vs horizontal board vision...
>Josh: DORRSUZ 6B DORR +29 295
>Michael: GIV 12L V.GI +18 189
>Josh: ?AESTUZ O8 AZUr.TES +194 489
#note Still wondering when the magic is going to happen? The delivery has finally arrived! One box of luck for Joshy on the house!
>Michael: APT 5D PAT +23 212
>Josh: ?EEELMQ 8G Q. +11 500
#note 13A MEL(T) if I think I'm gonna draw one of the three U's left in the pool
>Michael: DKUUU L6 KUDU +13 225
#note I must be psychic. Michael in fact had all 3 of the remaining U's here.
>Josh: ?EEEELM 6J EE. +9 509
#note EEEEEK!
>Michael: BEE I11 BEE +19 244
#note scored as 20?
>Josh: ?EEILMV N2 VErMEIL +78 587
>Michael: GINU F4 U. +2 246
#note without a doubt Michael held ING here.
>Josh: AEGINNO 3E ION +7 594
#note I kind of mistracked here but I knew there were 3 unseen I's and Michael most likely only has one. So I decide to try and block him but draw another bingo as well, hopefully. He's awfully close to a bingo, so I think this play is the best option considering a close-to-bingo ING rack and a lack of another I.
>Michael: FGINO 5J OF +22 268

>Michael: EEGINRT 13A GEN. +25 293
>Josh: AD 14J AD +12 629
>Josh:  (EIRT) +8 637
#note there you have it! My highest club game and 3rd highest score ever! One off my game against Matt Graham and around 90 off my target! :D
