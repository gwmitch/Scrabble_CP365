>Jim_Burlant: ACGIILS 8G CIG +12 12
#note Terrible statically, but within 100 iterations this jumps to the top of the sim.  55-1/2% to win.
>Darrell_Day: EV I6 VE. +8 8
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILRS G4 RADI.ELS +63 75
#note He's blocked the 7's and the only playable bingoes are this word and its two anagrams down the G column.  I chose this because it was the only option that didn't have issues with vowel placement (RADICLES and DECRIALS put the E and I at G10).  Quackle agrees - this is best, and I'm 71% to win.  But not for long.
>Darrell_Day: ?AEENSY 4D YEA.ENdS +72 80
>Jim_Burlant: BEFGIIL 3B FIB +23 98
#note I only considered H1 GIBE and this; 5B LIEF didn't register with me, but I don't like it now.  LIEF, and the only other plays that outscore this choice (BELGA 5C, and 5E FEAL) have such dreadful leaves that they're non-starters.  Hence, my choice.  Q agrees - this is best.  51% to win.  As I was looking at my next rack of AEGILOR I was convinced this was going to be my game, as I had 2x2's both at K4 and 11E with SERAGLIO and GASOLIER.  Little did I know what awaited me:
>Darrell_Day: DEEIOTT 10D TOI.ETED +63 143
#note Ok, a 63-point bingo is an air ball...but look what he's done.  Not only has he drawn a bingo out of the bag, but the only place it plays kills every possible bingo I have.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGILOR H1 LOG. +15 113
#note With my bingoes both blocked, what to do?  At the time, I felt I should unload the G and, while AEIR was a bit too vowel heavy for my liking, I rationalized this by thinking that, with all the open consonants to play through/from, I was essentially fishing for an AEILR, ADEIR, or AEIRT 8.  Also, while it was probably too early to worry about something like this, I didn't want him to hit me with HAZE H1.  None of my options are especially good - best are apparently 2A GO, 11J LOGIA, or 2A GOA. This is not an unreasonable choice given who it is I'm playing, but if I had it to do again, GO or GOA 2A may be a bit better due to leave.
>Darrell_Day: ?DHIIMO D8 Is.HMOID +82 225
#note  I held this but let it go - Darrell has just gone through all his 8's and with his sitting on the blank already with a 30-point lead, there's no reason for him to try the phony.  Good thing I let it go - it's good.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIRTU 15A GAU. +18 131
#note Between his three straight bingoes and my unloading GLO and getting GTU back, I've lost my composure. As I sat down to start Quackling, I looked at my scoresheet and face-palmed, as I saw the play I never noticed during the game: LIGATURE 1H scores 80.  The small consolation I can take:  LIGATURE barely wins 18%, as I'm still trailing by at least 60 after his next turn.
>Darrell_Day: AAJNNTU B11 JUNT. +24 249
#note Actual rack.  If I don't whiff on LIGATURE, he's either playing JNANA F2 or NINJA on row 14 and I'm sitting on MOR plus 4 unknown tiles trailing by 59 or 67 points.
>Jim_Burlant: EIMORRT 2A ROM +24 155
#note Best, but it's bleak.  Courtesy of my blunder on my last turn, my winning chances have gone down to 4%.
>Darrell_Day: HPQ 2G Q.PH +26 275
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEIRT 5B TIED +24 179
#note At this point, I didn't know I'd missed LIGATURE...but this was the second time this game a bingo had been blocked...and I've given up. I also felt that fishing wasn't going to get me anywhere given the ebb/flow of this game.  Best is apparently E10 OI or E10 OE to prevent this:
>Darrell_Day: NO 11B .O.N +32 307
>Jim_Burlant: AERTUXY 1J EUTAXY +56 235
#note At least I make one decent play.
>Darrell_Day: AKW K10 .AWK +24 331
>Jim_Burlant: EENRRRU 2M RUE +31 266
#note Hated what this did to the board but felt I needed to at least minimize spread. Q agrees - this is best.  2% to win.
>Darrell_Day: ORZ 8A ZOR. +39 370
>Jim_Burlant: AEENRRT L12 EAR +22 288
#note Best plays here are variants on the same theme:  do something to open up row 15.  Q's preferred plays are L12 EARN and L11 NEAR.  Those make sense in theory, but not practice.  The problem is that, if I do slot the 3x3, Darrell is guaranteed to kill whatever I put down (if his rack was bad enough he'd do it for 5 points) where Quackle might let the thing sit there untouched.  In reality, this game is over and I'm just trying to manufacture a spread saving bingo, hoping that he doesn't have the N, S, or L he needs to hook it.
>Darrell_Day: AABCLPS 15H CLAPS +35 405
#note Actual rack.  The consolation I can take:  had I played somewhere other than down the L column, I'd have lost a turn desperation challenging the 88-point BAC(K)SLAP bingo he told me was going to put down!
>Jim_Burlant: AEEFNRT 14I EF +28 316
#note Too much auto pilot.  EF M12 scores 8 more...but given his next rack it wouldn't have mattered.
>Darrell_Day: ANSV M10 VANS +34 439
>Jim_Burlant: AEINORT A8 .OA +12 328
#note As good as anything - this gives me outs all over the board.
>Darrell_Day: BILNOW 13G NIB +17 456
>Jim_Burlant: EINRT 5K INERT +14 342
#note Everything else the same but I find LIGATURE, then I can categorically say the game wasn't winnable.  Beyond that mistake, the rest of the game was played within reason until it was clearly a lost cause.
