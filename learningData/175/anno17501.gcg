>Josh: AHJV 8G HAJ +26 26
#note spotted a V here
>Michael: AIINOOP 9E PIANO +27 27
#note I don't like plays like POI that leave me with 4 one-pointers on my rack that really aren't that good. So I chose the higher-scoring play that apparently has a worse leave but I don't believe a word. I could otherwise play OI/HAJI to set my P up.
>Josh: LOSTV 7C VOLTS +20 46
#note Michael was using a lot of time starting this turn.
>Michael: EGIIIOU -GIIIOU +0 27
#note 10G GIE? I didn't even see it. I just wanted my drek gone from my sight. Also, I might want to keep GE, G or I here because of the board (JOG/HAJI). But nah, GIE is the play despite the atrocious leave
>Josh: MOY 10I YOM +23 69
>Michael: BEFITUZ 10B ZIBET +46 73
#note didn't want to allot free points so no 11J FUZE, but maybe FUTZ?
>Josh: AIR J6 RAI +19 88
#note already used around half of his time
>Michael: EFNORRU 11J FOUR +27 100
#note hmm D3 UNRO(O)F looks right here, instead of giving him another hook for his S.
>Josh: ANW 11C NAW +34 122
>Michael: AEENQRT 12H QAT +28 128
#note Damn it I missed Q(IN)TAR C9, although that gives him an S hook for free, so it's not as humongous a mistake. Still a big one though. I've never played QINTAR in a game before and have missed it many too many times.
>Josh: IMN 13G NIM +27 149

#note rewarded for my mistakes yet again

>Josh: ACIRSV 14H SIC +28 177
>Michael: ?EGGLOU F4 GOU. +7 254
#note 1F GOUGE is obvious. I missed it cause I had started fishing for something awesome.
>Josh: AGIV 1G VAGI +29 206
#note making my job easier
>Michael: ?EEGLNW 1M WEN +26 280
#note wow, 5A WEEkL(O)NG is awesome, not a huge difference though
>Josh: ER M10 E.R +3 209
>Michael: ??DEGIL C3 beDE.IL..G +78 358
#note Man oh man oh man are there awesome options here. I really just played this for style points and missed the just as stylish maybe 4D 2x2 disconnected 9s. REGILDING ENGILDING and DEGLAZING.
