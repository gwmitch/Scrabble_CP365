#note Didn't think of a couple options here. JEU and OUZEL are also reasonable plays.

#note Actual rack. BESIDE seems like the right choice to me.
>Noah: AAEIRTT J9 ARIETTA +66 237
#note Three bingos here. AMARETTI scored too few and ZARATITE gave way too much back.

#note Actual rack.
>Noah: ?AIOQRU 13G QUI. +24 261
#note Strange mistake -- I confused QUID and QUOD and thought both kept AOR?. Played this to keep the I open for my good bingo tiles. Also thought about QUITtOR but didn't seem good enough. QUOD of course looks correct here.

#note Actual rack. Now SHEA seems like too many points.

#note Seems best, but someting else could be better. Quackle's pre-endgame solver is, as usual, no help. It thinks this has 10 valuation and QUITE has 46, but this actually has better valuation than any one-tile fishes.
