#note Gave up some equity here not being sure KNOTTER was good.

#note POTTIER
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIOSUU -AEIOS +0 103
>Steve: IILOORY O8 .OILY +13 169
#note I have trouble with these kinds of racks and playing on the lead, but this turned out to be best. One of the interesting runner-up plays is G6 (THO)LOI for 16.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ASU 10K SAU +15 118
>Steve: EIMOORT 12K ROOM. +20 189
#note 12J MOIET(Y) said to be best. N12 MOO is second, playing on a good leave, but with the opponent just burning an S, it appears he is readying to bingo.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: JO F2 JO. +27 145
>Steve: CEEIRTV K3 CERVE... +44 233
#note I was pretty happy to find this, only to learn later it was a 40-point error to miss the bingo! Not an easy find. btw; the third best play according to Q is (J)IVE for a measly 14.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EF 13L EF +22 167
>Steve: AAINRTT 14M TA +10 243
#note O1 TANTRA scores 27, putting the lead up near the century mark. Not one I'd usually find. This keeps a great rack and closes out an easy bingo ending in S.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EFIS 3I FI.ES +28 195
>Steve: ABGINRT 2H GIB +27 270
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DG 4J G.D +22 217
>Steve: ?AIINRT B8 INeRTIA +66 336
#note ANTIaIR scores four additional points. That would have come in handy, as we'll see. Also doesn't take the S hook.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?CELNST 15B STENCiL +84 301
#note The anagram scores 90.
>Steve: ADELMPU O1 MEDULA +36 372
>Steve: ADELMPU --  -36 336
#note And so the implosion begins. 2L MAP is said to win 99 percent, and the play I was set to make 1G MAD wins 97 percent. Time trouble factored in this mistake.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ALRRSUW 1G WAR +33 334
>Steve: ADELMPU 13B .MPALED +26 362
#note Two available plays that win 100 percent. 11B RUMPLED, and D9 DEPLUME. This wins half the time according to Quackle. I'm screwed if the Q is in the bag.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AIOQRSU 6I AR.O +9 343
#note His best blocks my only out, but it shouldn't win if I play optimally.
>Steve: LU D12 U. +8 370
#note I miss his high scoring Q play, and by not blocking it lose the game. Maybe I see it if I'm not down to under :30 on the clock, and maybe I don't
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IQSU 10F QIS +35 378
#note For the win.
>Steve: L L2 L.. +4 374
