#note FE(R)N looks better here.
>Castellano: BILNQTY 8G N.BLY +16 75
#note BIL(G)Y has to be right here
>Joshua_Sokol: CFGINNS 14A FISC +33 144
>Castellano: ADIOQRT 15A AD +27 102
#note A12 (H)A(F)T looks a tad better
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGLNN K3 DANGL. +22 166
#note I don't know why I just changed gears like this. It was a very dumb thing to play this, not only cause I give him bingo lanes but also cause I allow him to score. D7 GNA(R) looks much better than this. 
>Castellano: EIOQRTT J2 QI +34 136
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINOOU -ENOOUIE +0 166
#note I should play OU(Z)O here for sure. Just completely missed it.
>Castellano: EIORTTT 7K .OT +4 140
#note looks as good as anything
>Joshua_Sokol: LNNOOUV 6K .NU +8 174
#note time to "paranoid" block. I just have no idea what his range is here, I was quite afraid he could still bingo after this, since LOTA and LOTI are possibilities. But this play is much better than it looks at first, since if I draw an I I have VOL(UT)ION and I might even draw EVOL(UT)ION! Yet my leave seemed terrible here.
>Castellano: DEIORTT 3G IOD.. +10 150
#note well, I blocked something. Josh really wanted to open here. This is the first opportunity to make a sneaky opening... More on that later.
>Joshua_Sokol: LLNNOOV 2E LOON +10 184
#note OV(O)LO is clear as crystal but I missed it...
>Castellano: ?AERTTU M5 T..U +4 154
#note missing AbUTTER and sTATURE. Damn...
>Joshua_Sokol: ELMNUVV -ELNUVV +0 184
#note looks like the right exchange. I think I need to exchange to better respond to Josh's plays.
>Castellano: ?AEEERT E2 .EE +3 157
#note 12A (HERM)AE looks good. Maybe even (HERM)A
>Joshua_Sokol: AIMNSTY H1 A..MY +39 223
>Castellano: ?AEERTW N8 TARWEEd +74 231
#note hmm, other bingos look a bit better.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIINOST O8 AI +17 240
#note the problem with keeping four 1-pointers. I don't know if I should have left O8 open given that I am no longer in the lead and would rather have as many lanes open as possible.
>Castellano: ABJOPRR M13 RAJ +25 256
#note good play
>Joshua_Sokol: INOSTUW L4 WI.. +27 267
#note hmm, not sure about this, but what else is there?
>Castellano: BEGOPRV O13 BOG +25 281
#note BOP looks better. The G isn't too bad here. PROVE and BEVOR at D4 looks good too. Josh was running out of time.
>Joshua_Sokol: EINOSTU I7 O..T +18 285
#note Given his time trouble, I thought it very strong to finally see/make the sneaky setup. Even though there is still an S out, I am very doubtful Josh will see it. Underscored by one, I was nervous :)
>Castellano: ELPPRVX D4 PLEX +34 315
#note 5D PREX(Y)
>Joshua_Sokol: EHINOSU E6 HUE +20 305
#note I.... didn't alphabetize......

How many times are Josh and I going to hand each other the game here?
>Castellano: EEFPRVV N3 VEE +10 325
#note He chickened out of VERVE. That is the play, although I may still pull off the win if I have a bingo. He still doesn't see S(TARRIEST)
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINOSS I3 .O +7 312
#note I felt here that he had not seen the hook and would not, and he had barely a minute left. I therefore decided that I needed every point I could get so as to win without a bingo, and that I might not win if I took the safer option, B10 (T)O(E), which eliminates the possibility of him blocking STARRIEST with U(H)
>Castellano: CEFNPRV 11K CRE. +18 343
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINSSU 11E ES +15 327
#note I should just take UNAIS I guess.
>Castellano: FNPTV 1G P.N +10 353
>Joshua_Sokol: AINSU A6 UNAIS +23 350
#note wow
>Joshua_Sokol:  (FTV) +18 368
