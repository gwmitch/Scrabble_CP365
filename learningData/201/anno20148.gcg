#note HELP! Maybe this is simple in either the leave value and/or the position, but how is EMU valued at six points better than UNJAM?

#note YOGI, same spot.  Seemed a touch too aggressive to me given the number of O's unseen.

>Matthew_Ridout: ADLNOOU --  -26 341
#note Still forgetting the A4 hook, my Swiss cheese logic for entertainment purposes only was that if this stayed, nice points.  If it's challlenged, I'm that much more unlikely to get the Q.  It just felt like a Q-stick was a good way to win.  It was terrible, of course.

#note I think is was when he had drawn the Q, based on post-game chat

#note And so now I am 100% to win.  Not deservedly.
BUT!   Q indicates COW and COIL next turn put -him- at 100% to win.   Quackle, I can confused myself on my own, I don't need your help :P
