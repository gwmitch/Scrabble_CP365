>Noah: BEHMRUW I4 BREW +30 106
#note I'm not very good at racks like this one. There are so many options, all of which I didn't even see. What would you do? This has some merit, as it seems to create a closed dynamic.

#note Actual rack.

>Noah: AIIINSS H1 INIA +20 157
#note I really didn't like opening so many comeback chances, and was trying to come up with something more defensive. How about INTI 9F?

>Noah: GIIOORZ 2F ZI. +32 237
#note Maybe FORGO? II isn't so great but the Z is strong here and FORGO makes it a little easier for me to start shutting down the right side, I think.

#note Hm, didn't think of HOAGY K7. UU is not very good here but points sure are! I think I play HOAGY.

>Jim_Burlant: DEIL J7 LIED +23 309
>Noah: ABEORRU K9 RUB +26 328
#note RUBATO is really tempting, but I think I'm much stronger at the pre-endgame than Jim, so I felt this would be better -- he gets a lot of easy wins from (RUBATO)S. 
>Jim_Burlant: AE 2E A...E +18 327
>Noah: AEGOQRT 1C QAT +16 344
#note Not playing off the Q gives me more trouble later, so I'm pretty sure I just need to ditch it now. 14F QAT is tempting because of two scoring spots but the one I opened is so huge. QI is also available but blocking this scoring spot seemed important, partially to complexify. QAT 14E might be better, as if I can fade the really huge plays (YELK, LINED, etc.), I come out really well, and I can beat those sometimes too. Not sure!
>Jim_Burlant: INO D9 I.ON +22 349
>Noah: EEGKORT B12 GEEK +24 368
#note Not enough time left. This loses 7/8 endgames to perfect play and most of them are easy. I just wasn't able to calculate enough here because I had so little time, and intuition told me GEEK was the way to go. KEG is a better play, and appears best.
