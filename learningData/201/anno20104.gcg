#note My leave is not great here at all but everything else is upside. This blocks a great scoring spot and opens a worse one, but more importantly blocks the huge (SOAR)S hook...and Nigel obviously has an S. Wading through EIIN at a deficit when Nigel probably has good rack isn't pretty, but blocking is too great here.

#note There are a lot of options here. My analysis during the game was far from thorough. RETEM/REMET O5, fERMENT 14D, O4 TREEN, H7 SOME, 3L MEZE and 3J NERTZ all seems worthy of consideration. Not really sure what's best here, though I like RETEM.

#note I thought it would be great to keep the F here but it seemed that I just had to sacrifice too much on other fronts to do so.

#note I was really afraid of making a mistake here, especially with so little time left, and ended up just going with my gut with no time to calculate. As far as I can tell, POT wins 7/8 endgames, and this not nearly as many. Blah.
