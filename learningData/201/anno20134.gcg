>Steve: KLNRRTY G8 .RY +10 10
#note T(I)NKLY best, followed by K(I)RN. I probably should have exchanged tiles, keeping RT.
>Dan_Stock: ANUU 7I UNAU +8 20
#note I read Dan for a bingo type leave after his last play; glad to be wrong for once.
>Steve: AKLNORT 8L TANK +30 40
#note Was deciding between this and NARK. I chose wrongly, and missed the best play according to Q - TALK.
>Dan_Stock: EIIOPRT N5 POI.TIER +64 84
#note N and C are the only letters that allow Dan to bingo with this rack.
>Steve: ILMORTU O1 MULTI +28 68
#note I missed the 7-L bingo here, but even if you find it, it isn't easy to see where it fits. I also get away with this phoney, which I questioned myself on (after having played it). 
>Dan_Stock: ACEV 12J CAVE. +20 104
>Steve: AEEIOQR -AEIOQ +0 68
#note Quackle likes keeping IER, but I don't play well with more than one i in my rack.
>Dan_Stock: OOZ 10D OOZ. +36 140
>Steve: EGINRRS D7 IGN.RERS +72 140

#note ToUPEES scores 85. 
>Steve: ACEHLOW 11A OCH.EA +37 255

#note Quackle says to play G(R)AN here, followed by T(R)EF. This is said to be third best by C-player. FRENA in this spot scores a hefty 46 points but has a leave of 3 consonants. A short sim likes my play the best.

>Steve: AEGLNSS 3E GLA.NESS +62 383
#note Wasn't sure of LASAGNES for some reason; glad to have this as a back up.
