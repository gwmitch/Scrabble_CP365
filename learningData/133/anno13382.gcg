#note Not very good, I'm not giving myself a good leave when there are plays available that do so. Quackle significantly favors 9H HI, which in retrospect I like as well.

#note Best

#note Quackle approves
>Mary_A: ?CEEHRT 11F ETCHERs +82 139
#note Not really a whole lot I could do to stop this...
>Rob_R: GIIMOOT 8L .OIT +12 91
#note This falls a few points behind Quackle's choice of 10C TOOM. I certainly see the rationale, but the difference is 17% to 15% to win. In this situation, I will generally increase the volatility and give my opponent as much as possible to worry about. Despite the valuation, I think this gives me the best chance to come back.
>Mary_A: KLP J10 K.LP +20 159
>Rob_R: GIILMOY 14G LIMY +39 130
#note Not very good. I completely whiffed on CYMOL, though the leave weakens it quite a bit. Quackle is favoring 14H GOYIM, which I discarded across the board - I didn't really recognize the limited comeback potential if offered Mary.
>Mary_A: AVW 10D VAW +30 189
>Rob_R: EGINOOY 15D YOGIN +47 177
#note 15E GOONY is reasonable as well.
>Mary_A: DLR E9 L.RD +34 223
#note In my own defense, I did hold the play. I was relatively sure that it was a phony, but wasn't quite able to pull the trigger.
>Rob_R: DENORST 12D O.D +17 194
#note At least I got this play right!
>Mary_A: AADN 13J .ANDA +16 239
>Rob_R: ?BENRST O6 Bi.TERNS +69 263
#note This is second best, by quite a bit. The star play is lovely, and I missed it despite looking for it. 
>Mary_A: AR K4 RA. +28 267
>Rob_R: EIOOVWZ N10 WO +28 291
#note Quackle likes 13A WOVE, threatening WIZ or ZOWIE with an E draw. In a perfect world, that would stay open next turn...but I didn't think that it would and figured I'd be better served by trying to limit Mary's options. This starts a trend for the rest of the game.
>Mary_A: INPS 13B NIPS +22 289
>Rob_R: EEIOUVZ B11 ZO.E +26 317
#note Wow...I finally get a chance to play EVZONE and I swing and miss.
>Mary_A: EOTU D4 TO.UE +30 319
>Rob_R: BEIRUUV 8A VIB. +27 344
#note Quackle likes K9 BU(R). Getting rid of the second U would be nice...I overfixated on scoring as much as possible.
>Mary_A: AN N5 NA +10 329
>Rob_R: EEFIRUU 15A ER +20 364
#note I played this to block both the S and the O hooks, again trying to limit how much Mary could score. Unfortunately, it would behoove me to start worrying about the possible bingo. 4C E(T)UI wins about 85% of the time.
>Mary_A: A 11B .A +11 340
>Rob_R: AEFIOUU 4D .AU +3 367
#note One of three plays with the best spread, the others being E3 OI and C3 OI. No matter what, I need to block SECTIONS.
