#note Awww I thought HOER was CSW for some reason. Stupid mistake. This gives back some nasty parallels.

#note Very frustrating. I knew DGNPRAEO looked so familiar, but I just couldn't unearth the bingo. What's worse, I had another chance to salvage this rack, but missed JEOPARD. Ridiculously awful turn, and I deserve what's going to happen to me the rest of this game.

#note QUART puts me up by 16, but gives Patrick a great hook and empties the bag going into the endgame. It just didn't feel great. With what I drew and what I left in the bag, QUART would have won. Quackle says QUART is the play, too. But jeez, it still looks so bad. I mean, all I have to do is draw a vowel to LTTV? and I can surely outrun in the endgame with two in the bag. Right? Guess not. This endgame is karma for DOGNAPER and JEOPARD. What a gross game! Two weeks in a row of gross club games! Need to drink more coffee and suck less.
