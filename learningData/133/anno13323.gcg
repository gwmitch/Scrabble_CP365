>Rob_R: DEMPPUX 8D PUMPED +32 32
>Mary_A: ?AALNNT D8 .LANTAiN +70 70
#note Not quite Mary's dream play of LANTANA, but a pretty find all the same. ANN(U)LATE was available, though as it turns out I drew a C.
>Rob_R: CEILNVX 13C C.LIX +44 76
#note I was so focused on trying to ditch the V (14A VEX(i)L) that I nearly overlooked this. Always remember Jim Kramer's motto: "find a good play, look for a better play."
>Mary_A: ACDEN 15A CAN.ED +27 97
>Rob_R: AEINSTV 7H NATIVES +68 144
#note Best.
>Mary_A: ?AEHLTY 12F HEALThY +90 187
#note Best. Mary was definitely firing on all cylinders tonight!
>Rob_R: EGILOOT 9G EGO +20 164
#note Sims best, but N2 IGLOO(S) looks pretty strong as well if only for opening the board up some more.
>Mary_A: JY 10C J.Y +13 200
>Rob_R: BILMNOT N1 INTOMB. +34 198
#note Again, sims best. MOB 8M is reasonable, though that starts to direct the rest of the game into a slogfest.
>Mary_A: AGT 1L GA.T +21 221
>Rob_R: BFFLOOR 4J BOFF. +26 224
#note I wasn't terribly pleased with opening the hotspot, but I was equally displeased with an LR leave to play at 2H. Quackle agrees.
>Mary_A: AEW 5J AWE +31 252
>Rob_R: ALOORWZ 2J ZOO +35 259
#note I totally whiffed on 11B ZO(N)A. I elected to play ZOO as opposed to WAZOO because I wasn't making up ground while continuing to give Mary 30+ point responses, but the W seems pretty toxic here. Still, Quackle calls missing ZONA a 12.5 point error, which might even be underestimating the mistake.
>Mary_A: DEO 11B DO.E +29 281
>Rob_R: AEELRRW 13K EAR +12 271
#note Quackle prefers REPUMPED by about 4 points.
>Mary_A: IRU A12 URI. +7 288
>Rob_R: ELRRRRW -RRRW +0 271
#note Best exchange. I actually overdrew on this turn by having a tile stick to the edge of a band-aid...it was a U. Barf.
>Mary_A: HI J10 HI. +14 302
>Rob_R: DEEKLNR N10 KERNE +42 313
#note That was a fortunate draw. KERNE sims best and gets me back in he lead holding both the D and L to hook if Mary doesn't have an S.
>Mary_A: GIRT O8 GRIT +23 325
>Rob_R: ADELRSV 15L VELD +46 359
#note 15J RAVELS, scoring 6 more and emptying the bag, is ahead by about 4.5% wins and 15 points to VELD. I honestly don't see what makes it so much stronger.

I'd love some feedback on this position.
>Mary_A: I 3M I. +14 339
>Rob_R: AORSSUW 10C ...S +16 375
#note This wins, but it's not very good. O4 SO is best, if you happen to remember that BOFFO is a noun. I really don't know what I was trying to accomplish here.
