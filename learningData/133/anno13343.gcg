#note OF at N1 would've been great - I have the case T, and it neutralizes the htreat of him creating a hook at 2K.

#note the N seemed to help the leave but GLNT? is too unbalanced

#note it seemed that I would bingo after just about any bingoes on column O, and that Ed wouldn't be able to chase me down if he bingoed on column K. quackle likes TONG a lot, which increases my chances of bingoing a lot, but I also make it much easier for ed to bingo as well. I think I like PROW.
