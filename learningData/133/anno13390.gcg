>Mike_Early: LOX 8G LOX +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: BDEILPR 9H DIB +20 20
#note This rack makes only one 8,  PREBUILD.  The sim likes 9H PI a little better, saying that this play, the silver medalist, wins roughly 3/4% less often and sims 1 point down.
>Mike_Early: ALMOO 10D MOOLA +13 33
>Jim_Burlant: EFLPRUV 7B PURFLE +16 36
#note This is the sort of position I struggle with and will frequently misplay: overloaded with negative tiles, with none of the obvious dumps (e.g.:  FAUVE) available, and the only plays that do score require me to burn all my bingo-prone tiles just to unload one counter while I still have to keep negative tiles.  I hated this play but the brain freeze resulting from the clunk overload made me whiff on all the better options, like E9 POUF and D8 FUMER.  I saw PROVE  but didn't think Q would want me to keep FU.   Ruled out OVULE due to both volatililty and leave.  PURFLE does a great job cleaning out this nightmarish rack, but the resulting board position is so dangerous that Quackle is entirely right when it says this is a 10-point dog.  It wins 5% less often than POUF.  POUF or FUMER are best.
>Mike_Early: IJN 8A JIN +36 69
#note Just desserts.
>Jim_Burlant: ABNNOOV 11C VAN +20 56
#note Didn't like BOON 11B or ABOON 11A, and I didn't see the row 6 plays.  I also was dead set on unloading the V.  Not thrilled about keeping duplicated O's, but they're not the worst thing in the world.  Q agrees:  it's either this or ABOON 6F.  
>Mike_Early: EI C11 .IE +12 81
>Jim_Burlant: BEGINOO 6C BOO +17 73
#note And if I draw a second E instead of an I, I'd have GOBONEE.  Instead I have another inert rack.  Nothing really scores here - Q wants me to play B12 OBOE or dump the rack with 6G BOOGIE.  The B12 plays strike me as reckless - why repeat the mistake I made with PURFLE? I think this is fine - if I draw an R or S, my remaining EGIN suddenly becomes very potent. 36% to win.
>Mike_Early: EHNT 12A TH.NE +31 112
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGINU A8 .UG +11 84
#note Didn't even occur to me to score with this.  Q looks correct in its assessment of my play:  the play was 14A AUDING for 32.  Q says (correctly) that this sucks.  
>Mike_Early: DGIL 6G GILD +14 126
>Jim_Burlant: AADEINT D4 AD..N +26 110
#note Takes a while for the sim to sort itself out, but this eventually percolates up to the top of the sim.  Either this, 11C VANDA, or J9 BA are the top chioices.  The sim says they're all equally strong plays.  
>Mike_Early: ADEHIRR 11H HARRIED +80 206
#note 14A plays score 83 but they give me a clear shot at row 15.  Quackle wants Mike to play at 14A, and that's what he initially put down before pulling it up and playing here.  I personally think this is the better play for him. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEEIT 4C f.CETIAE +60 170
#note Nothing plays down the L, M,or N columns and there are no 7's in this rack, and everything available (this, Em(A)CIATE, or (A)CIErATE, all on row 4) scores 60.  The sim says (A)CIErATE 4D is the (marginal) winner.  17% to win.
>Mike_Early: CIKPR 14B PRICK +53 259
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ?AARSWY L8 StA.RWAY +86 256
#note Lots of style points for this choice, but the equally stylish AiRWAYS 15F scores 95.  32% to win in a short sim with this; AIRWAYS wins 41.  
>Mike_Early: EFGOY 3I FOGEY +43 302
>Jim_Burlant: AEEISTT 8L .ITE +12 268
#note Q likes M13 ETA - I don't.  Even if it's only a baby bingo of 60-some points, my gut says I need a bingo to get back in this game, and I thought that something like ETA M13 (Quackle's preferred play) made it too easy for him to defend the board with something like VOWED N7 or if he added resistance by underlapping the E and Y of FOGEY with something.  Then again, if I'd have played ETA, this would have been a much different game. 
>Mike_Early: IQS 7M QI +44 346
#note Post-mortem, Mike told me he had an S in his rack on this turn. Had I not opened this line up, he'd have played QIS 15A 48.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEENSTT 15F ATE +15 283
#note Be honest - how many of you would have found ENSTAT(IT)E N1 in this position?  Anyway - had I played ETA on the previous turn, Mike would have played QIS 15A for 48 and I'd have played INSTATE N1 81 and it would be a more or less even game.  Instead I have an all but certain loss now. As for this - still trying to keep my options alive.  I still had my eye on a bingo ending in SE at O1...but time was running out.

#note Time was an issue here.  I finished with 10 seconds on my clock while Mike still had 15 minutes.  Par for the course when you're playing Mike these days.  Best is NEUM 4L 21.
