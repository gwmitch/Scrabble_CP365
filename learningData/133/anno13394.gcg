>Jim_Burlant: ILNOSWW 7F WOW +21 21
#note Q says that either this or 7H WOW 18 are identically strong plays.  I'm assuming that the board positiion of the 7H placement - both eliminating possible X plays at I9 and giving myself the S hook down the K column compensate for the 3 points I'm giving up on the scoreboard.
>Chris_Schneider: AFILRRU -AF +0 12
>Jim_Burlant: AHIILNS 9I HI +18 39
#note Hated this choice because it's such a huge defensive liability (what with the C, D, E, M, N, P, S, and T back hooks it gives up down the 2x2) but I don't have anything available that doesn't open up too much, so I might as well maximize my leave value.  Q agrees with me - despite how much this gives back, this is best.  
>Chris_Schneider: EGINORT K5 GENITOR +88 100
>Jim_Burlant: ?AILNSX 8K .XIAS +60 99
#note You don't do much better stumbling ass-backwards into greatness by fishing X? to AILNS.  Yes, I saw the bingo at 12E which scores 80.  And I passed it up once I saw I could score 60 and keep LN?.  The sim confirms that bingoing is not best here - it wins 5% less often and, at barely 300 2-ply iterations, it sims 10 points down on this play, which is best.
>Chris_Schneider: ABDEILR J6 BI +22 122
#note Chris knew he missed something here; post-moretm he told me this was his rack.  While he wasn't going to prevent me from bingoing, this did change the game.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AELMNO O8 .EMOLiNA +80 179
#note Best bingo.  Other options include O1 MELANOUS, O1 ALMONERS, 11E AMELCORN.
>Chris_Schneider: AADELRS M3 SALAR.ED +72 194
#note Chris is back in the game - he's 49% to win in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: FIILOSV 14J VIOLI. +34 213
#note Best, but I'm more or less treading water - 53% to win in a short sim.
>Chris_Schneider: ESTZ 12I ZEST +35 229
>Jim_Burlant: EFIOSUV 4L V.U +12 225
#note No clue what to do so I figured I'd unload UV and set up an O1 play since I was sitting on the case S.  Q likes 10J FOOD but says this is almost just as good.  Food wins 43.2%; this wins 42.4 and sims not quite 2 points down.
>Chris_Schneider: ACER 13F CERA +20 249
>Jim_Burlant: BEFINOS O1 FOBS +38 263
#note Shameful!  I was reasonably sure that this was bad, but given how poorly the game had gone I didn't want to lose the challenge and watch my O1 play go away, so I let it hold. Also - given what this does to the board, the only danger is if he's got a bingo ending in T that plays at 9A and I'm about to come back for 38 points.  Again, Q likes 10J FOOD, but I'd make this play again - S is otherwise pretty useless on this board.
>Chris_Schneider: AMN 15L MAN. +20 269
>Jim_Burlant: EEINNOT N1 EN +13 276
#note Nothing really scores, but N10 ONE scores 17 and is a hair better.
>Chris_Schneider: DEGINOT -DEGIN +0 269
>Jim_Burlant: DEGINOT 6M .G +7 283
#note The best play here is utterly sick:  DOGDOM 10J 24.  Among the plays I should havefound were ODE N10.  This is weak.  I was hoping to hold the rack together so I could bingo on row 9, which in retrospect looks pretty questionable.
>Chris_Schneider: Y 12I ....Y +17 286
>Jim_Burlant: DEINOTT 10J T. +8 291
#note And if I'd played at N10 like I should have at some time in my previous 2 turns, he wouldn't have had ZESTY.  As for this - I just didn't want to open up.  Q wants me to play 6B DITTO - pfffft.
>Chris_Schneider: AY N10 AY +20 306
>Jim_Burlant: DEIINOT L2 DI.E +14 305
#note Well, I finally made a good play.  This is best.  
>Chris_Schneider: AP H13 .AP +15 321
>Jim_Burlant: HIJNOTU G12 J.HU +23 328
#note Strong play but not best -  6B JUNTO scores 37 and is best.  I was playing much more defensively.
>Chris_Schneider: EKPT 9D KEPT +18 339
>Jim_Burlant: DEINOTU D9 .UDO +18 346
#note Not at all thrilled about unloading the U with the Q still unseen but it's the right call.  This is best.   Back up to 48% winning chances.
>Chris_Schneider: GNR 10B GR.N +11 350
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEINOT K2 OD +10 356
#note I was pretty darned sure that GRUN* was phony.  But with me sitting on the blank and having a sure bingo in hand, I figured it might be good to let this stick if only to give me another line for an easy 8.  Q indicates my decision to pass up the bingos was correct, and the tile pool shows why.  If I bingo here with DEmOTING etc., he may have QI 8A coming back for 68.  Just the same, I may draw the Q if he bingos back (more on that in a second).  As for this choice, I had mistracked; I showed an N remaining instead of a T, so I thought I saw CARLINE and RELACING as possible bingos and I didn't see anything in the pool with which he could really hurt me if I put this down.  Best looks to be 6E DOT, scoring 20 qand taking the bag down to 1.  As it is, this lured Chris into another mistake.
>Chris_Schneider: AEEQRTU 1G QUART +46 396
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEINRT 2C aRENITE +73 429
#note As he saw my rack, Chris's question:  "You're gonna bingo out on me again?"  tHEREIN scores 79 at 2B.
