#note No 7's in this rack, and the only 8 was INTIFADA, which didn't play.  Obviously a fish was in order, but the big question was whether to take the extra 6 points to play the D with AID.  Even though I was sitting on the blank, I didn't feel comfortable giving Sam the 2x2 line to work with when my rack didn't have an E.  Q says I should take the extra 6 points, saying that AID J8 (sim winner) wins almost 1% more often than this, which is the sim runner up.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EELORRV H3 OVERR.LE +65 87
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEITU F8 AUDITEd +74 88
#note Chose this over row 11 plays because I wanted to take out the front hook to JUGA.  Also didn't think it was worth the extra three scoreboard points to open up the S hook to row 15 with AUDITeE or AUDIEnT, which score 77.  Q says I should have played on row 11 with DAUTIEs or AUDITEe and docks me 3 points for this.

#note Yes, I'm a dumbass.  It didn't even occur to me to look for a bingo in this.  If you miss 6F PARTAKEN as I did, this is best.  But this is a bad miss:  PARTAKEN wins 73%; this wins 58.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADEIILT 4B DILATI.E +74 171
>Jim_Burlant: ACENQTT 3C QAT +50 175
#note A no-brainer.  Nothing else scores more than 32 where this play scores 50.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: BDET H12 DEBT +36 207
>Jim_Burlant: CELNNRT 5G T.NREC +20 195
#note Nothing really scored here.  LORN 3G was a nice rack balancer but only scored 12.  The pool still looked pretty balanced, so I didn't think it was worth giving up the 8 points to keep the rack together.  All I felt I could do was dump the rack and try again. Q agrees with me:   LORN would have been a good choice, but this was best.  30% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EY I2 EY.. +20 227
>Jim_Burlant: HLNNSUX L2 LUN.H +20 215
#note Looked at the options and realized that landing an A or E guaranteed me at least 41 coming back on row 5 next turn, and A, E, or O potentially gave me 50 coming back at J2.  With this in mind, I felt the best play here would be to clean out the rack and give myself enough chances to draw A, E, or O.   I saw a potential G front hook to LUNCH making GLUNCH, but with at an almost sure 40+ coming back next turn I felt this was worth the risk.  Q mostly agrees, though it gives slight preference to SCHULN L4, presumably due to the possibility of a row 1 play making GLUNCH.  This is the runner up and it sims 1 point down on SCHULN.

#note As planned.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EOORW N2 WOOER +37 284
>Jim_Burlant: AHIINOS 15A OHIAS +38 303
#note Considered I13 HI but ruled it out as being too dangerous due to the unseen Z.  Besides that play, anything else that cleared out one of my I's and kept the S didn't score squat.  Meanwhile, this took out row 15, score 38, cleaned out the rack - in short, by far and away, the best play.  Q agrees - this is best, winning 49-1/2%.  Nothing else wins 40.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: INN O1 INN +22 306
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDILNZ 14H .IZ +34 337
#note Not at all thrilled to set up the easy back hook but didn't see much of anythng else.  And given that the O column was still alive, it wasn't like this was the only line he could hit, so I went for it.  Q says it's either this (the sim winner) or G11 DEL, which I didn't see until the next turn.   79% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EOSTV K10 STOVE +31 337
>Jim_Burlant: ?BDLNNU 10H .ND. +17 354
#note Saw G11 DEL but didn't like keeping duplicated N's.   Didn't see 14A NUB as I was fixated on not leaving myself without vowels.  This was the only play I saw which kept my vowel, even if it was the U.  Q likes 14A NUB and says this is a 13-point dog.  Perhaps, but given Sam's next play,  this may have been the best play I could make this game.

>Jim_Burlant: ?BELNOU M8 UNBO.LEd +70 424
#note You have to know it to play it- NELUMBO playst at O5 for 78, and M7 NOBELIUM scors 70.  Whatever, the bingos all clinch the game.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AFMRSSW 8L F.RS +33 392
>Jim_Burlant: EFIMO N12 .OME +27 451
#note The lesson here is to always find your opponent's best play and address that, which I failed to do.  D1 FOAL only scores 11, but as you'll see in a second, you'll see it would have saved me almost 10 points of spread:
