>Jack: AACLOOY D8 .OCAL +20 20
#note Championship player likes YO(D) a tiny bit better than (V)OCAL. Also, CO(D)A or YO.
>Isaac: AEW E11 WAE +24 50

#note quite the draw to my AOY

>Jack: EIKLNOR 1L .KON +24 155
#note ENOKI 3B or L(I)KEN. Sim reallly liks K(A)OLIN with or w/out the E. (I)KON is after KAOLINE.
>Isaac: EFW M3 FEW +30 124
>Jack: EGILMNR K4 GREMLIN +74 229
#note MINGLER for one more.
>Isaac: AEEEMOT -  +0 124
#note challenged gremlin
>Jack: ?DDGNRY 9J D.NGY +12 241
#note I considered DYED, DINGY, DUNGY. I didn't like how DUNGY allowed a potentially big TW play at H11 although it does make it harder to bingo on row 11. Champ likes DRY (F12 opening another S spot) and DUNGY best. The top 10 plays are all between 98.0 and 99.0% win though, DINGY included. I think I took a long time with this turn.
>Isaac: EP 2N PE +18 142
>Jack: ?ADNRSS 11H RADS +32 273
#note DANS(E)uRS, SANDeRS, StRANDS. Well... I didn't play any of those. I was really pretty much set on using one of my S's for GREMLINS and then bingo later. I don't know if 32 points is worth it. I chose RADS over RANDS (or NARDS, etc.) primarily because of AZ* or AX* plays. Also, I have the case N so I don't mind NS?. 

Champ agrees with me except for danseurs since it's 79. Again, the win% isn't a huge difference.

>Isaac: AMR C11 MAR +21 169
>Jack: ??ENPRS 14B PENSteR +77 365
#note Not sure what champ player is talking about. Sim likes SPURNER, SPENCER etc at 14E since it is pretty hard to bingo afterwards. ENCRYPTS is also up there. HYPERONS is 84 but too dangerous. 
>Isaac: CU H13 C.U +15 184
>Jack: BHIIOOX 8N OX +32 397
#note (D)HOBI is nice, taking out the bottom two lanes. OXO, XI, OX and everything else sims at 100%.
>Isaac: ITZ J11 .ITZ +34 218
>Jack: BHIIIOT 13J .ITI +8 405
#note Very low on time here. I'm not sure really what to do even after looking at all the choices.
>Isaac: G 9C G. +5 223
>Jack: ABEHIOU 7N BO +21 426
#note Why'd i got with BO, HO is clearly better. A point more and more potential for next turn. OBEAH is pretty cool since i have the last A and it makes it pretty hard to bingo.
>Isaac: EH 15A HE +19 242
>Jack: AEFHIOU F2 .UAI +13 439
#note I should just keep the I off.
>Isaac: EEJRS 6B JEERS +46 288

>Jack: EFHOOR C2 HOOF.R +26 465

#note Scored as 465 to 301 I believe.
