>Noah: III -III +0 0
>Carl: ADELSTZ 8D ZEALS +48 48
#note I spent perhaps too long on this rack, dithering between ADZ and ZEALS. ADZ wins the sim by 4.
>Noah: ADNSTV E5 ADV.NTS +44 44
>Carl: ?ADGTUX D2 GAUD +15 63
#note I thought about sim-winner DUX F3 but it seemed like Noah would always have a good comeback play. DANG 9C looks better in retrospect. I probably didn't consider it because it retained the bingo-crippling UX combo. (-12)
>Noah: AJR C1 RAJ +41 85
>Carl: ?BCCHTX -BCTX +0 63
#note I decided not to keep the T because all prospective bingos play to consonants. Nonetheless, Quackle says CHT? is about 2 points better.
>Noah: EINNP F2 PENNI +24 109
>Carl: ??CFHLS H1 FLySCHe. +95 158
#note At last I got something right, but even this took me too long, setting me up to make more mistakes later on.
>Noah: AX I6 AX +38 147
>Carl: EHILNTU J5 UH +30 188
>Noah: QV -QV +0 147
>Carl: EILNRTW K2 WILT +18 206
#note Quackle fishes with WAG 2B, but I'm not a fan of opening big lanes that I can neither use nor block. I thought it was more prudent to take start taking out lanes at this point, especially column K. That said, I didn't know TWILT#, which devalues my play considerably. (-15?) 
>Noah: DOP 9C PO.D +24 171
>Carl: EEGNORR 10E .ONGER +17 223
#note Once again, there are no standout plays. No ways to score, no fishes. This time, Quackle prefers the better leave after TORE 10E. (-4).
>Noah: AAI I1 AIA +13 184
>Carl: AEEEERR 9I EE +8 231
#note PEREA C9 wins the sim. I thought it was worthwhile to devalue the primary bingo lanes. PEREA can also be parallelled for a lot of points. (-8?)
>Noah: AFLO L3 FOAL +26 210
>Carl: ACEERRU 11J ECRU +15 246
#note I did not know PUCER#. (-6)
>Noah: EGORT H10 .ORGET +27 237
>Carl: ADEIIOR 15C DIORI.E +9 255
#note I was flustered at this point. OIDIA sims better, but, once again, it seemed like it would give Noah first crack at some easy points without leaving anything for me. Quackle says that fishing off IO is better by 15 points. I considered this, but looking at all the unseen EIO letters dissuaded me. Maybe this is a situation where I should fish not because I'm close to a bingo, but because there are no other reasonable choices. (-15)
>Noah: BEEIOT 14A TOEBIE +33 270
>Carl: ANOTTWY A11 NOW.Y +36 291
#note I decided correctly that TAWTIE# cannot be spelled with a Y. However, TOWNY and TWILT# fare better in the omniscient eyes of the duck. (-10)
>Noah: IMY L9 MI.Y +18 288
>Carl: ABKQTTV 1A VA. +18 309
#note Not only am I in time trouble, I'm angry to have drawn BKQV, the worst possible combination. VAV 7C is clearly better, and VATU M8 is better still because it takes out the bingo threat, cutting my losses. (-20)
