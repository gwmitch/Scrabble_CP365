#note Hmmm... Nah this isn't good. I think exchanging is right, but given I know he is about to open some vowels for me, I should trade tighter and go for a bingo. INT is not the best leave here, at all. Maybe just ex DD

#note BATTIK is great. Don't know that one. After that, all the plays are mediocre.

#note These racks have been really annoying and super time-consuming. I'm already down to 8:30 when I slap this down. What's worse is that Phil is now blitzing me, so the rest of this game is pretty hectic.

#note Missed GAWKY. And VIEWY is probably better too. Rushing these plays. I thought he might not know SWINGY and so valued this higher.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AADLOOV 13H .OVOLA +26 231
#note I was annoyed to have OVOLO blocked and my options were bleak. (I didn't see VODKA in time.) I decided he was unlikely to challenge at this score, and setting up a phony in a hookable spot could provide the momentum swing I need later on.

#note I don't actually want to bingo on this line. I just want to distract him from the better ones.

#note There's lots to consider here, and unfortunately the sim can't accurately accommodate for HOVOLA*, which is going to greatly impact our plays. My reasoning with the fish is that there are a lot of things that can go right. I could get a bingo and Phil may not be able to block all the lanes, especially since he's unsure of the hooks on the phony. I could draw one of CPF and hit SEARCH, SHAPER, SHARIF on the top row, which could outun him if he takes small points to block bingos. And lastly, I could just win if Phil tests his luck and tries to hook HOVOLA*.
