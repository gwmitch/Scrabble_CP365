#note I was kind of hoping that he wouldn't see the g hook and that I'd be able to use it later, since I'm pretty far behind at this point.
>New_Player_2: CEIIILQ H3 QI +26 245
#note So far so good, he blocked the triple lane there.

#note I guess roam is better here, but I liked my leave too much
>New_Player_2: AEEGGKO 13F GAGE +23 385
#note Awesome, now I'm positive he's disregarded the hook up top. There is still hope.
>New_Player_1: AIINORT 9H I. +5 292
#note Unfortunately, I didn't draw the right tile. I really need to bingo next turn.

#note Perfect draw. It's still a game if I can just keep scoring.
>New_Player_2: EJKNOUU 8A JOKE. +51 460
#note OK, now I need the g and a bingo...
>New_Player_1: AAAGILN L13 AA. +7 389
#note Analgia. Didn't know that one. Now I need to bingo out.
>New_Player_2: AEMNNUU F3 UNAU +12 472
#note Good, he still seems to have forgotten about the glittered hook.
>New_Player_1: ABGHILN 9G H.. +11 400
#note Now here is where I make the worst move of the game. I have around 35 seconds to spare, so I should've checked and seen EH, which would have won it for me. I also missed the much better fish, BABY, for 34, which also would have one unless Jason saw the hook on LITTERED. Given that he has FOX, EH has a value of -23 if you add it to Jason's next best move. BABY has a value of -19 given that I will draw an s next turn and play LASHING.
>New_Player_2: EFMNOUX J5 OX +56 528
#note Too much!
>New_Player_1: ABGILNS 1D ABLINGS +94 494
#note I managed to draw the right tile, but had I gone with baby or eh, I likely would have won either 508-500 or 540-528.
>New_Player_1:  (EMNFU) +20 514
#note Great score, as I had 5 bingos and still lost. A memorable game, even more exciting due to it being played in under 7 minutes.
