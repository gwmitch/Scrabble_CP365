>Rob_R: ?DNORWY 8D WORDY +32 32
#note This seems to sim best, though I was sorely tempted to play 8H ROWDY for the -ISH and -ISM extensions.
>Carl_V: AJLOPTV F6 JA.L +27 27
#note Best
>Rob_R: ?ACFINT H1 sANCTIF. +104 136
>Carl_V: DMNOPTV 2G V.MP +17 44
#note Best again.
>Rob_R: AGILNTW D8 .AWLING +28 164
#note Quackle has a slight quibble about whether to play this at D6 or D8. I guess the D6 placement is slightly more defensive, but personally I like more open boards.
>Carl_V: BDEHNOT 1J OBTEND +34 78
#note This is significantly better than any of Quackle's suggestions, because Quackle doesn't phony. I think I confused this with OBTUND. Of the valid words available, Quackle strongly prefers 14A BON(G)ED.
>Rob_R: EILMRTX 4H .IMEX +32 196
#note The stronger leave of 13B MI(N)X leads Quackle to favor it, though there is very little difference in winning percentage. Overall, this has been a very well-played game so far.
>Carl_V: EFHPRSV 3K PERV +31 109
#note Best. Scrabble is rough when you can make the best play four turns running (including making up your own best play) and you're still down by almost 100 points.
>Rob_R: EIILRTT 5J IT +18 214
#note Best.
>Carl_V: FHIQRSY C12 QI +37 146
#note Yup.
>Rob_R: EEILRTT E7 T.LE +14 228
#note Quackle likes J4 (MI)TE, which does have the benefit of creating a bingo line for whatever I'm hopeing to draw into with EILRT. It goes both ways, though...I figured Carl for a stronger rack than he actually had, and I didn't see the need to open a new bingo line for him to have the first shot at.
>Carl_V: FHORSUY C9 HO +26 172
#note Carl's still batting a thousand. Though the leave is unwieldy, this scores and sets up an S-hook for him to use. 10B HO(WE)S is rated well by Quackle, though I feel that it starts to raise the white flag.
>Rob_R: EEIORTZ B13 ZEE +36 264
#note Gotta take the points. This is best.
>Carl_V: EFHRSUY 15A F.U +18 190
#note 15A F(E)Y wins the sim, though B7 RUSHY is right behind it due to its much higher score. The UY leave weakens B6 FRESH significantly.
>Rob_R: IKORRST B6 KORS +26 290
#note I could have retained my S and blocked the simplest bingo line if I had thought of HALLO - G8 (D)ORK wins the sim.
>Carl_V: EHIRRSY O3 SHERRY +58 248
>Rob_R: AEEGIRT C2 TERGAI +25 315
#note If Carl can make up a phony six, so can I. I would've much preferred FIGEATER though. I also thought TERGAI was good...
>Carl_V: DDEINOU B2 UDO +17 265
#note Carl's winning chances aren't great, but this seems to maximize them.
>Rob_R: BEINSSU J4 ..NIBUSES +67 382
#note Definitely my best find of the year so far!
>Carl_V: DEILNOU 12H IN.OULED +74 339
>Rob_R: ?AAEGIO 8J .A +4 386
#note There are multiple winning plays here. A1 AgOG withstands OCEANAUT by 4 points, but having seen his potential bingo I tried to maximize spread by blocking it and giving myself a chance to bingo myself. I was running rather low on time, so I didn't have a chance to go through all the permutations of the one-in-the-bag endgame...it doesn't look like there's anything I can hit on the one tile fish. Quackle says the best valuation comes from M9 AGI(L)E.
>Carl_V: AACENOT D1 CANE +31 370
#note This is good, but CANTO nets a few more points.
>Rob_R: ?AAEGIO O11 A.AGE +21 407
#note I missed the star play here - N1 (N)O(V)EnA. This ties for second best.
>Carl_V: AOT A4 TAO +16 386
#note What a great game!
>Carl_V:  (IO?) +4 390
