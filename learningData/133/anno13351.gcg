>Jack: ?IOTU G8 .UOIT +15 15
#note Robin said she had the blank from the beginning, but crappy kicker tiles
>Robin: ?AENOSW F10 WOE +31 53
#note Any of the WEA?ONS for 86 are best. WOE sims under them, about 3% back.
>Jack: AEMN H12 AMEN +25 40

>Robin: BCELOST E12 BLOC +14 139
#note CEL(e)B 6F, COBL(E) 14D, BOL(E) 6F, BO(I)TE H6.
>Jack: ANPR 14B APR.N +18 94
>Robin: AEERSTZ 15A ZEE +42 181
#note ZA vs ZEE.
>Jack: ABDO 7H B.OAD +12 106
>Robin: ADFRSTU L3 FRAU. +18 199
#note FRAUDS M2 for 32 is best and second is FR(A)UD. I considered all 3, but I was paranoid of the double double, and paranoid of the S hook. TUF(A) sims well too.
>Jack: FI 3K I.F +18 124
>Robin: DEHKOST 13B KOE. +35 234
#note TSKED for 46. Championship player takes TSKED after KOE(L) and after OH(O) J5. It's 11 more points than my play, but opens up 2 more lanes. She's already extremely close, I don't think I should open up lanes. That's why I like OH(O) since it blocks bingoes through the A.
>Jack: GL 5K G.L +8 132
>Robin: DHILSTU 6I .H +25 259
#note A lot of E's out, I'll take 25 and shoot for DUELIST. I like SIDH 8L for 38. It might be hard to bingo with the D or H. Any other FRAUD hooks are pretty good too like SHUT, SHIT, SHUL. I think that my thought process was that if she bingoes with a GAL hook and I miss DUELIST then I'll have a nice shot at one of the TW. Plus, the lane she created with GAL is not likely to score big.
>Jack: ?AEGNNR N4 NEARiNG +68 200
#note pREGNAN(T) for 80, 1A.
>Robin: DEILSTU E4 DUELIST +72 331
#note (M)USTELID
>Jack: IMV D3 VIM +26 226
>Robin: CDEGIST O1 CITES +33 364
#note Well there were definitely a lot of plays better than CITES like DIGEST or DICES, but it didn't affect my chance of winning by much. GED O6.
>Jack: ERY G3 RYE +20 246
>Robin: DEGJOVX 8M J.G +30 394
#note I was getting nervous about the XI spot and then I drew the X. Lucky me, and what a relief. Take JiG here and hope for an I. 
>Jack: ADW C4 DAW +17 263
>Robin: DEIOTVX F6 XI +52 446
>Jack: AH D8 HA +20 283
>Robin: DEEIOTV 13H .OTIVE +24 470
#note (N)EVOID 15H. Good looking 8 tiles left. I was worried about MARLIEST, MISALTER, MURIATES, MURALIST. A bit go through the N but the only one that scores anything more than 59 is (N)EUTRALS. I was also very low on time so I saw MOTIVE and went for it.

#note ED(I)T.
