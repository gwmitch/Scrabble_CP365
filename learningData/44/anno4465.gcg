#note Didn't know AHEIGHT#, so missed 4 points here. Still, up by 134 now, shouldn't be too hard to close it out. Or is it?

#note Key play, and I didn't get it right. First wanted to do (A)ENEOUS, but then I saw I could take a pit stop and clean up my junk with EUOU(AE). I missed sticking an S on it for +18...I was thinking, yes, it opens up H4 nastily, but if Quackle gets that I'll most likely get it back or close on row 15. Wrong way to think at this score, though - why not play six tiles and quiet the board? Too impatient.

#note This wasn't terrible, but it was impatient too. Two N's aren't such a big deal that BANE or NABE same spot wouldn't have done. Quackle likes BENNE G3, and maybe so, but that seems a little riskier than I want to be.

#note I lost this game here, led astray by the quick 33 points. What I should have seen and didn't examine enough is that Quackle might well have the Q and nowhere to go with it. ZIN M11 (or something else there) takes away QI or QADI.
>Quackle: ACDEOQS 11K QAD. +28 376
>Geoff: GIJNNSY L10 J.NNY +30 391
#note nY#/YINS O12 plays out 7 points better than JANNY#. Got fixated on unloading the J. No way to win this now, too bad since I had a solid lead midway through. Didn't control the board as I should have and paid the price.
