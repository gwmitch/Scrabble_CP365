>Rahn_McKeown: EMNOY 8D MONEY +26 26
#note I like the defensive placement here.
>Evans_Clinchy: CGJNNNZ -CGJNNNZ +0 0
#note If he'd played it with the M on the star, I'd have kept NG and fished for MONEYING. But instead, I opted for a fresh seven.
>Rahn_McKeown: FGILNNU E7 F.ULING +22 48
#note Of course, he draws ING.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BIRRST G5 RaR.BITS +63 63
#note Or BURRIEST, BRUITERS, REBIRTHS, ORBITERS or ARBITERS.
>Rahn_McKeown: EJOT 12A JETO. +40 88
>Evans_Clinchy: AACEIQV A12 .AVA +42 105
#note I hate AJIVA here. I think it's easily worth the 3 points to keep QI on my rack. Could I be wrong?
>Rahn_McKeown: FOY F4 FOY +31 119
>Evans_Clinchy: CEIQTWZ E3 ZIT +35 140
#note Missing TWICE H1.

#note Uh, it has an anagram.
>Rahn_McKeown: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 193
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ADEORW 3H .EARWoOD +78 284
#note Or POLEWARD, SOWBREAD or SHADOWER.
>Rahn_McKeown: DRU -  +0 193
#note He held for a while, recognizing the alphagram ("oh, I always guess RAPEWOOD*), but not seeing the word. Eventually he gave up and challenged.
>Evans_Clinchy: BDELNPU O1 PU.DLE +36 320
#note BUDDLE is a little better. Don't think I knew the word.
>Rahn_McKeown: DRU 7M URD +17 210
>Evans_Clinchy: BEEHINX A7 HE +26 346
#note I knew my spread wouldn't matter -- as long as I won this game, I was playing in the final. So I got lazy and took out the triple the first way I saw how. EXINE is a bad miss.
>Rahn_McKeown: AAILNST L2 A.L +12 222
#note Chickening out on LATINAS, missing SANTALIC.
>Evans_Clinchy: BEGILNX N6 B.ING +28 374
#note I figured I was in no hurry to cash in the X... there were a bunch of good spots. Thought I'd balance the rack a little, shut down a bingo lane, and hold the X for a little while.
>Rahn_McKeown: AGINOST 1A AGNOSTI. +86 308
>Evans_Clinchy: EKLORTX N1 OX. +42 416
#note Yeah, Quackle thinks I should have played this X a long time ago. Oh well.
