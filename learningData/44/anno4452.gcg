#note knowing DEION(I)Z(E)D wouldve saved me a lot of torment
>Aditya_Kina: EH A1 EH +23 60
>Max_Karten: BEINOTZ 6B B.. +18 125
#note i overdrew on this turn and he threw back an A which cost me BOTAN(I)Z(E) and TRIA(Z)INE so i was pissed and not thinking clearly and WAY too determined to hit an -(I)Z(E) word on the next turn
>Aditya_Kina: II -II +0 60
>Max_Karten: ENORTTZ H1 TENOR.Z. +54 179
#note of course i see TENOR(I)T(E), and I know hes fishing and probably desperate to use a T, E, N, or O to hit an 8 so... yeah. i was telling sherrie about this play and adam logan was sitting right there and he just laughed, she called it a "dick move" haha. i asked him if it was that ridiculous of a word for people who you know dont study 8s and he kind of thought about how to nicely say "no its a totally ridiculous phony" but it just kind of came out as him laughing at me haha. easily one of my favorite plays from the whole tournament.

#note okay who lets TENOR(I)Z(E) go then challenges this totally plausible word? o yeah, he needed the T to bingo, thats right. damnit.

>Aditya_Kina: ADM --  -26 137
#note this was actually the part sherrie was calling a "dick move" haha.
>Max_Karten: GIINOST 3H .OTING +16 195
#note being a little too defensive here, something like (Z)IG or (Z)IT leaves me a nice chance to bingo

#note i was trying to force a (WAUR)S* play at this point so im not sure why i would play this, weird.

>Max_Karten: ACLMOSU 12A CAMS +28 457
#note not sure i have the right rack written down, i was only holding 6 tiles so i know its not right, but even if i had MUCOSA(E) and out idk that word. MUSCL(Y) and especially CLUMS(Y) im pretty sure were not options.
>Aditya_Kina: GIN A11 I.ING +24 339
#note he went out with I(C)ING leaving me with two one point tiles so something was definitely recorded wrong
