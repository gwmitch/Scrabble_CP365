#note Dangit, SUNNIES#. I saw it, thought it might be #, but wasn't sure enough to pull the trigger.

#note 12I COKE wins (secret Atari 2600 reference). Or 12K KOI or KO#, which I didn't think of for some reason despite spending a long time on the play...I was sort of thinking that I should create some more action for my S, and NOCK does that, but at maybe too much of a sac - 4 points, plus INS > EIS.

#note This seems like the obvious spot to play in, and I wanted to ditch the O, and AEIL seems like the most workable leave given the pool (GJLOORRRSTVY). I figured I'd be in trouble if Quackle played on the M column (JOL#, JOR#, JOT or JOY at M2).
