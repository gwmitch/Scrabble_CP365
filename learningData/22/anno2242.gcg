>Phil: EEIILMR D8 .LIME +18 59
#note I don't know any 5s (CEILI, IMIDE, MELIC). It's funny- Sam and I were just talking about how the L was a pretty good tile- Quackle prefers CRIME to CLIME.

>Phil_Polsky: AEHIJNP 8K .HLAM +42 173
>Phil_Polsky: AEHIJNP --  -42 131
#note It took me a really long time to challenge this. My precise thoughts were "would he really try a phony that looks that retarded?"
>Phil: GILNNTU L6 LINT +23 114
#note After 5000 iterations, Quackle favors NUT 12G by 1.1 points and TURN by .3% (.1 fewer valuation points). Why? LINT scores 12 and 11 more, respectively, and GNU isn't the worst of leaves. Besides, what -ING bingos will go on this board anyway?

>Phil_Polsky: AHT 8K ..HAT +24 182
>Phil: AADIPPR I3 PAP +20 214
#note I seriously overrated how bad the P was. DAP 12K is so much better, which I saw, but RAPID 12K is best (didn't know REQUIRER).
>Phil_Polsky: BEINR B10 BIN.ER +30 212
>Phil: ADIRSUW 15A D.AW +36 250
#note WAUR HI is so superior, can't believe I missed it. I'll have to settle for second best play here.
>Phil_Polsky: DOOR H1 ODOR +29 241
>Phil: GIRRSTU N6 GU.R +9 259
#note This play is fine, removing all the plays involving REQUIRER.
>Phil_Polsky: ??ABELO A4 ruBEOLA +75 316
#note Bad play by Phil. GLOBATE scores 82 (CEMBALO and BEEFALO score 83)
>Phil: EEILRST 2A RELISTE. +72 331
>Phil_Polsky: AEEETV C1 E.EVATE +22 338
>Phil: GNNOUXY 1C .X +34 365
#note This was a tough play for me, buy Quackle agrees with EX/XI.
>Phil_Polsky: AK B1 K.A +23 361
>Phil: GHNNOUY E2 .UNNY +16 381
#note Ok, this is a play a 500 player would make. Honestly, I don't know why I did it. YEH G1 is by far the best play, followed by VUGH 4C (according to championship player). 
>Phil_Polsky: ACEFJOS G1 S.C +20 381
>Phil: FGHJO I10 J.G +11 392
#note Champ confirms that JIG wins 100% of the time.
>Phil_Polsky: AEIOO H13 .OO +12 393
#note I was hoping he would'nt see AI D4, which he didn't. He was really low on time though.
