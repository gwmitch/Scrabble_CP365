>Sam_Rosin: ABIIIRY -BIIIY +0 0
#note Fifth place staticly, but wins the sim.
>Jason_Keller: DEEIOTT -EOT +0 0
#note I didn't really like my options here especially given his exchange.  Biggest score is 8G TOITED for 18 but lots of options, including my exchange are within 2 percent/4 valuation points.
>Sam_Rosin: ABGIMRT 8D GAMBIT +26 26
>Jason_Keller: DEEEIT 9E DEET +20 20
#note I'm missing a tile from this rack.  This is next-best from what I took down, but I really hope it wasn't an N that stayed in my rack, because then I missed DET(A)INEE E5 for a double-double.
>Sam_Rosin: AFNPRRV 7B FRAP +19 45
>Jason_Keller: EHINOTV C3 HOVE. +22 42
#note I wrote down HOTVINE for my rack here.  This is OK, but Q likes OVINE 10C.  I like the next two choices VINE 10D and VEIN 10C, which don't give up a front hook.
>Sam_Rosin: AEFNRVY D1 FRAY +43 88
>Jason_Keller: BDILNOT 7H BIND +16 58
#note Missing underhooks again.  This scores 13 more at 10D.  BLIND 10C is best.
>Sam_Rosin: EGNNORV K4 VEN.OR +20 108
>Jason_Keller: ?DIILOT 10E ID +24 82
#note Best, and better than the bingo that plays at 5F.  I wonder if Sam knows that one.
>Sam_Rosin: CGLLNOO 1D .LONG +27 135
#note Almost perfectly equal with GOLF. I prefered FLONG because of the challenge chance, since there was no ascertainable difference between it and GOLF. Perhaps a bit open to an X play, but GOLF allows OX 2A as well.
>Jason_Keller: ?ILLORT 5E TROLLI.s +64 146
#note Should've made the blank a D apparently.
>Sam_Rosin: CCDILOZ D10 DOC +17 152
#note Not a good play at all. The top plays are CHALCID 3B 16 and DOLCI D10 21, neither of which I knew. FLOCCI B7 is another better option that I didn't know. However, I certainly could have found COED 6A or CLOY 4A, two other higher-simming plays.
>Jason_Keller: AAAEHRT 2D .AH +29 175
#note I should dump a second A here for two points fewer (AAH B2).
>Sam_Rosin: ACILTUZ 8A ZA +38 190
#note My first reaction was to disagree with FUTZ B7 being better, as it seems overly risky with IIIUUUX still unseen. However, Jason's last play telegraphs that he doesn't have the X, making FUTZ much more reasonable. OCULI 8K, which I didn't know, is the sim winner, keeping the Z, which can score a lot on this board.
>Jason_Keller: AAEKRST 13B TAKER +29 204
#note KARATES using that hook kicks butt!  It would have been nice if I had seen that.  With what's in the bag here, two-tile dumps (KA) look next-best.  This cost me later.
>Sam_Rosin: CILNNTU B10 CUN. +12 202
#note OCULI 8K is again the sim winner, and I also don't know ONTIC 8K, which beats out CUNT. CULTI B10 is a play I very well could have found; no idea why I didn't find it, and if I did, why I didn't play it.
>Jason_Keller: AAOQSTU B2 QAT +36 240
#note  I decided against B1 QUA, going for points, J9 AQUA is Q's pick...
>Sam_Rosin: ?IILNTW I2 WIL. +8 210
>Jason_Keller: AEGOSUU 4K .UG +16 256
#note Had I played QUA on the previous turn I end up with OUTAGES here.  Many of the recommendations from Q here are exchanges.  Perhaps throwing back the Us is a good idea here, especially if I don't get them back.  I got through these gracefully, though.
>Sam_Rosin: ?IMNSTU N2 MISTUNe +78 288
#note Hated playing this, but I didn't know MUSTINg N2. ONIUM 8K might be better than this overly volatile play.
>Jason_Keller: AENORSU O7 ARENOUS +79 335
#note My thought here was "thanks for the better spot, Sam."
>Sam_Rosin: EEEIOSX A13 SEX +40 328
#note This phony (STAKER*) was key. However, it's not even best. That would be XI O1, which can score well due to the S. A leave of EEIO is never optimal.
>Jason_Keller: AEEEIPY 13J PAYEE. +22 357
#note Championship player says M1 PEA(G) is the way to go here, and I agree. I figured I would either outrun JO or draw the J here.
>Sam_Rosin: EEIJOOS O1 JO +31 359
#note There are a few plays that win here. I just screwed up. JOE 14H is great, setting up the JO play to the triple he can't fully stop. JOES 14H, JEE 14H, OI 14I, JEEP J10, and SI 14I ALL win. The frustrating thing is that I wrote JEEP down on my paper.
>Jason_Keller: EIIW 15A .I +9 366
#note J11 WIPE wins.  I fixated too much on the S hook.
>Sam_Rosin: EEIOS J12 O.E +7 366
#note Again, I screw up in a huge way. OI 14I and POI J13 are both winners. SEI 14I and PIE J13 both tie. I'm embarrassed at my endgame here--being low on time is no excuse.
>Jason_Keller: EIW L8 WE +20 386
>Sam_Rosin: EIS 10K SEI +20 386
>Sam_Rosin:  (I) +2 388
