>Phil: EEFPRSY 8G FEY +18 18
#note I debated FEY vs. FEYER for a while. Finally decided on the right move.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: BEIL 7I BILE +19 19
>Phil: EPQRSSW J6 Q. +31 49
>Sharon_Swerdloff: EHIKLMO L4 HOM.LIKE +86 105
>Phil: EEPRSSW -  +0 49
#note Challenged. I hate those -LIKE words. Recently challenged HALOLIKE at club...where do they come up with these?
>Sharon_Swerdloff: AGZ K3 ZAG +37 142
>Phil: EHPRSSW K11 PHEW +32 81
#note Weird. Quackle likes HEW 11K, then PHEW/SHEW 11J. PHEW scores way more than all of these plus it opens the board. I disagree with Quackle here.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: EFINNRU 9B FUNNIER +70 212
>Phil: ENORSSV 15G OVENS +37 118
#note I'm down 131 four turns in. I was furious. I just threw it down, knowing it was no good.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: ACLRW M11 CRAWL +27 239
#note Didn't even hold.
>Phil: JORRSTT 8A JO +32 150
>Sharon_Swerdloff: ADEOOT D6 ODO.ATE +18 257
>Phil: ADRRSTT M2 TRAD +21 171
#note Ugh, missed DRAT 10F using the same letters and not killing the PECS lane while scoring 4 more.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: EINO 8K O.EIN +17 274
>Phil: AMRSTTU O6 TA.TRUMS +63 234
#note I was happy about finding TANTRUMS, didn't even consider other bingos. STRATUM 14A scores 13 more, but provides for big counterplay (I still would've played it if I'd seen it)
>Sharon_Swerdloff: AEGGU C3 GAUGE +23 297
>Phil: ?IINPXY 14D PIXY +37 271
#note I saw each of Quackle's top four choices. PIXY, PIX and PYX E3 are retarded because they kills the 7 lane. PIX 9K might score 5 more, but the leave probably won't bingo. I still like my PIXY the best.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: ?ABDINS E1 BANDItS +75 372
>Phil: ?DEEINR 1A lINE.RED +149 420
#note Took me a little while to see the only triple-triple (my second ever in tournaments).
>Sharon_Swerdloff: CEIOORU -  +0 372
#note Challenged
>Phil: ALOOTTU 11D .OUT +8 428
#note I don't care what Quackle said. After a comeback that big, I was not risking any stupid crazy 8 letter out bingos through that T or E.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: ACEIRSV 15A VISA +29 401
>Phil: AELOT N12 ALE +24 452
#note OLEA in the same spot.
>Sharon_Swerdloff: CIR 12H RIC. +10 411
