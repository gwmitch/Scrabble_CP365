>Carl: IRRSTWX K4 WRIT. +16 16
#note Close. WRITER is a little better. But why does (S)IX F8 (RRSTW) sim so well?
>Maddy_G: ?ACERTU H8 .UTRACEd +80 148
#note It took 12 games before someone double-blanked me.
>Carl: EORSTTX J5 OX +52 68
#note Are there any 8s in EORSTTX? Don't look too hard.
>Maddy_G: AEPV L1 PAVE +34 182
>Carl: ERSTTUU 10H .UTU +6 74
#note Yes. I drew UU. And Quackle recommends fishing one of them off, keeping the robust ERSTTU. Or play (P)UTT. Sure.
>Maddy_G: ADEGP 1J GA.PED +36 218
#note That's some impressive word knowledge. The low-prob verbs can be tricky. BAPPED, for instance, is not acceptable.

#note ARB is a little better.

#note Fish all you like. All your options are equally miserable. Things are so hopeless that ESCORT 15J wins the sim.

#note Here, I'm hoping to stick my opponent with the Q and set up something with AHI if a bingo doesn't materialize. HAIR 2K or HAIK B12 are both significant improvements on this play. 
>Maddy_G: QT 12G Q.T +12 420
#note Not gonna happen.
>Carl: AEIILRT 13B LATI +25 314
#note Quackle considers this 21.9 points worse than the fish. WTF? What exactly am I fishing for, and where does it play? A. The bingo will never win. B. It will always be blockable. C. My opponent will sometimes bingo out. Just take the points.

>Carl: EIOR M3 OI +23 337
#note While ENERGY seemed on the surface to be a great finish to a game with more than a couple interesting 6's, my opponent unwittingly stuck herself with an S, of all things. Despite this, ENERGY sims second best behind GYRE 6A, which doesn't give up as many points. Were I in her position, I would have probably missed the threat too.
