>Jason: EIMQRTU 8D QUIRT +48 48
#note More good timing: First three I look at are MQR ... pretty low odds I'd be able to cash in this well. Of the four obvious options, this sims best.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AAEFRRV F6 FA.RER +19 19
#note Speedy likes playing shorter with FA(I)R or VA(I)R in the same spot by a bit. Can't fault this play, though. I never seem to be happy with my blank-drawing, but it's in part because I play too short early sometimes.
>Jason: AEEHMNU D8 .UEEN +28 76
#note Missed A(T)HENEUM, but can't be upset about that.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?AADHSV 13B DASH +31 50
#note Playing next to Frank and Scott Appel, Frank and I were worried this was our group of four. Fortunately it wasn't; our group also consisted of Paul Avrin and Robin Pollock Daniel. Three of us finished 2-1; poor Bradley was the whipping post. Nice comeback by him, to go from 1-5 to 6-5 after day two.
>Jason: ADGHIMR C9 MAD +21 97
#note Speedy says I picked the wrong one debating between this or GHI at E4, but it's fairly close. Hoping to cash in with a big H play at B10 next turn.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?AEIOVY 11C ..A.Y +18 68
>Jason: EGHILOR H2 REGOLI.H +64 161
#note See HOL(D)ER at B10 for 54, then look through the T, prompting the "GOTHLIER*! No! Not GOTHLIER* but REGOLITH!" train of thought.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?AEEIOV E4 VOE +17 85
#note Tough choices. VI(R)EO cleans the rack up better, but makes eights harder. After VOE Bradley's got a decent shot at bingos through the R.
>Jason: BEGOSTT G1 GOB +18 179
#note Sims best.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?AEINPT 10H sAPIENT +78 163
#note Bradley looked for nines with this rack. PrET(OR)IAN isn't worth it; (BE)PAINTEd scores 80, as does sAPIENT at 10H.
>Jason: EENSTTW B8 TEW +33 212
#note Another bingo miss, TWENT(I)ES. Should've looked harder through the I. Liked this play too much.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: BCEKNOT A5 COKE +36 199
#note Ooh, KETON(I)C as a double-double for 52! That would've been a heckuva find.
>Jason: CEENSTT 2F C..NET +16 228
#note Wow, top 15 options within 3.1 points. I picked the one on the bottom.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: BDDLNOT L8 BL.ND +22 221
>Jason: AEJRSTZ 8J ZE.RAS +51 279
#note Nearly threw back JZ before seeing this. ERSATZ at O8 for 57 is better, though.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ADIOOTU 1K AUDIO +23 244
#note Ah yes, the "play off four consonants, draw four vowels" sequence. When I pointed out the consonant dump-vowel dump sequence post-mortem, I said "Gosh, you must've drawn awfully." Bradley, always a gentleman, said "It could've been worse." Frank pointed to his game with Appel. "It could've been this!" he said.
>Jason: ?GIJLTU K5 JUT. +22 301
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AIIORTW L4 WO +19 263
#note Bradley hated leaving two I's with three unseen here. Maybe OW at 14B? Speedy's pick is daring, but maybe this is a time to be daring.
>Jason: ?GILNNV N5 LeV.N.ING +62 363
#note Bradley took a long time to play WO, without which I might not have seen this. I'm trying to find an alternative to V(U)G at 6J for 15, maybe kilingl the -S spot, going, "can I play an -ING word between the A and T? Well, the logical letter between them is the N. -ANTING ... holy sh*t, I have LEVANTING. Don't block, don't block, don't block..." Thankfully he didn't.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AIILPRT I5 PI +10 273
#note He needs one of the two E's I've already drawn. Speedy likes TIPI at 3L.
>Jason: EEFIMOO 14A FOE +20 383
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AAIILRT 15A AL +25 298
#note Wow. Last four in the bag were SSXY. Bad timing for Bradley.
>Jason: EIMOSXY 13G MOXIES +35 418
#note Really cute sequence I missed that's 18 better; MISE/(BLEND)E sets up OXY at O13 or 14E. I actually saw that, but I couldn't see a spot to play off EIMS. Dang not knowing BLENDE.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AIIRST 14I ITS +20 318
#note I had Bradley in time trouble; after PI he had 3:55, I had about 15 minutes. Under normal circumstances, I'm sure he would've seen IRIS at 14G, seven better. A very solidly played game from Bradley ... chalk this one up to the tiles (as you can chalk up most of my games here).
>Jason: Y 6A .Y +13 431
#note 1-0 and about to defecate on the board vs. Robin Pollock Daniel.
>Jason:  (AIR) +6 437
