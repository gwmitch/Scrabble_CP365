#note Exch. IOO keeps moving up in the sim, but after 650 slow iterations Quackle likes OORIE. I'd rather exchange. Opinions?
>Cynthia_Seales: EIKLLR 8D KILLER +30 30
>Phil: ?AEOPRZ E6 EP.ZOA +34 34
#note Wow, I missed POLARIZE/APHORIZE/VAPORIZE. Idk, obviously 86 points is worth it but if she has a D that's an automatic 50 point counterplay...at least. I'm not saying I wouldn't play these bingos if I saw them, they're just risky. EPIZOA scores a solid 34 keeping a 64% chance of bingoing. Obviously not the best play, but solid nonetheless.

#note Don't know the sweet ACARBOSE or CRAMBOS. This represented the 9000-1000 group on aerolith!
>Cynthia_Seales: EIMORRU F6 RE... +18 86
>Phil: AEEEHIU 4H AU.EI +12 125
#note HIREE is just asking to draw two vowels to fuck up your rack. Besides, it gives scoring form the H1 TWS. AUREI cleans up the rack, keeping the H for scoring next turn. Q votes: HIREE. I vote: AUREI.

#note CHAINES combines with 8 letters to bingo (all are consonants). Why didn't I put the H on the DLS... geez.
>Cynthia_Seales: AEGILNT 3B GENITAL +70 273
>Phil: DDEMORT 11J MOR. +22 269
#note Wow, game-losing play. I was so concentrated on the lower-right corner, I totally didn't look elsewhere. DOMED 4A is best by a longshot. FUCK
>Cynthia_Seales: IX 8M .IX +30 303
>Phil: DDENTVY H1 DE..Y +27 296
#note DELAY sims decently, but DAVY G11 is best. Missed it, I guess.
>Cynthia_Seales: AMU 2B AMU +22 325
>Phil: ADDNOTV 13J DOT +16 312
#note I guess the play-like-a-1200 switch went off about 3 turns ago. Idk why in the middle of games I just sometimes start to play like crap. It's weird, but scary. OCTAD is best, but ironically gives her a bingo. DEV H7 is a very close second, and doesn't let her bingo (obviously I didn't know this yet).

#note SIR N12 got an extra point (so what). I find it disturbing that after starting the day 6-1 and playing the first half of this game pretty solidly, I just collapse. I don't understand why this tends to happen to me but I seriously need to learn how to control it and prevent it.
