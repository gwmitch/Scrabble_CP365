#note SR: One of those "My god, what a load of shit--hey, wait a second....." racks. 
>Dave: AAENRST 12D A. +6 98
#note DK: That damn Stefan only makes bingos that don't take S hooks!
>Stefan: EHIJKLO J10 KHI +45 233
#note SR: KOJI in the same spot may be a smidge better, but offers Dave an even better S hook than the one he just made. 
>Dave: AENRSTU C8 SAUNTER +70 168
>Stefan: EJLLOTZ 4A JELL +42 275
#note SR: For some reason, I've been getting the J and the Z together a lot this tourney. How about that. 
#note DK: Think you've seen some offense already?  The really flashy plays are coming on the next two turns.
>Dave: AEEFGGW H1 GEEG.W +45 213
#note SR: Pretty play!
>Stefan: BIOSTWZ 11I ..OWBIZ +48 323
#note SR: I hate to keep dropping these heavies in the triple lanes, but that's a heck of a lot of points.....
>Dave: ?ADFGLR 2B FRAgGL.D +82 295
>Dave: ?ADFGLR --  -82 213
#note DK: I felt the game starting to slip away and thought it was a good time to put Stefan's word knowledge to the test.  He passed the test.  Objectively better is FILAR N10.
#note SR: "Dance your cares away, worry's for another day. Let the music play...." FRAGGLE*, GORG*, but DOOZER is good! 
>Stefan: NPRSTVY 13J SPRY +29 352
#note SR: Meh. This is a pretty crappy choice on my part. Quackle likes VINY at N10, which is stupid since I know he's got an L, but there are plenty of other better choices than SPRY. If I'd thought about what Dave might try next, I definitely wouldn't have been so cavalier about spending the last S. 
>Dave: ?ADFGLR O11 .ARF +17 230
#note DK: Having already lost a turn, I decided before Stefan's move that I was going to try this gambit.  Once he burned the case S, it was clearly a strong play.
#note SR: Oh, fiddlesticks. 
>Stefan: AEFNNTV 14M AF. +23 375
#note SR: Which way to go here? Take the 48 for FANJET? Or try to gum up that spot as best I can? I can't entirely kill it, but if he hasn't drawn an A or an E, AFF  makes it pretty much impossible for him to do anything there. Even with a big lead, I don't think I'd ever have the cojones to just cede him that spot. 
>Dave: ?ADEGLM 15K GAMEs +85 315
#note DK: Before Stefan played AFF, 15J LAMEDS and 3G MEGADEAL were almost the same score.  I was actually going to play MEGADEAL on the grounds that I would still be down, and leaving the ZARFS hook open for the second blank would increase the randomness factor in the result.  However, after AFF I thought it was better to take the extra points.  Also, the DL stands for decent leave.
>Stefan: EENNTUV A4 .ENNET +39 414
>Dave: ?AADLOT 14A cA.TLOAD +70 385
>Stefan: BEIOUVV H12 VI.E +36 450
#note SR: When I looked at my crappy draw and saw him putting down a bingo, I started having flashbacks to that loooooong streak where Dave always found some way to beat me. Fortunately I can get enough points here to stay a solid favorite. 
>Dave: DIMPQRU N10 Q. +31 416
#note DK: PIQUED ends the game too fast, but there's no real hope here, since Stefan is sure to block the bingo lines on rows 1-3.
>Stefan: BEHLOUV 2G H.LVE +19 469
#note DK: While I was waiting for Stefan's play, I fantasized one scenario where I would win:  If the B and H were in the bag, maybe Stefan would try to block with ON I1, giving me IMPRUDENT.
#note SR: Dave held this, giving me a couple minutes of terror that I might have blown the game by misremembering my fives, which I hadn't studied in many months.
