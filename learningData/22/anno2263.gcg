>Jason: AACHJRT 8G HAJ +26 26
#note First three I looked at were AHJ, the other four were a good leave, didn't see a five doubling the J, so I slapped it down. Missed RAJAH, but the leave's so good this is only marginally worse.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: QT H7 Q.T +12 12
>Jason: ?ACNORT 10B CARTONs +78 104
#note All four options (CANTORS CARTONS CONTRAS CRATONS) sim neck-and-neck.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EGMNOR C7 MEG.RON +30 42
#note Thought for sure the S or blank would follow. (Even though MEGARONS* is no good ... thanks, Sam and Cesar!)
>Jason: AADHIMU 8A HU.D +30 134
#note Speedy likes HUMID, but I don't like playing the I with HAJ on the board.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: LLOP D12 POLL +24 66
>Jason: AAIIKMU J6 AMIA +22 156
#note Gah! UMIAK! Chickened out on it against Easter in Ortonville and didn't see it here! Almost a 20-point mistake.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AEISTTV K8 STATIVE +87 153
#note Held, did the math, realized it's just outside the top 3K range, and accepted.
>Jason: IKNNOSU B12 KOIN +28 184
>Jason: IKNNOSU --  -28 156
#note Yeah, pretty bad. Against her, of all people, do I pick the time to play a phony four. I think Robin said she had a trip-trip through it if it stayed on, though, which mystified me that she challenged. Maybe I misheard, though; she was grumbling.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: CDIU 15D .UDIC +24 177
#note The only eights with the ?N?L???? pattern including CDIU are INCLUDES/UNSLICED and INCLUDED. Since Robin's STATIVE was her only play with a blank or S, she must've had INCLUDED. But why pass on 108 to go up a bingo on this board?
>Jason: IKNNOSU B12 KOI +26 182
#note BTW, the best play last turn hooked the -S to STATIVE, which I didn't think you could do. Thank goodness I didn't play Speedy's pick of K(E)NOS (which I considered), or Robin would've wondered why I didn't play OINKS.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: BEVY K3 BEVY +29 206
#note NOW she blocks the Z- hook!
>Jason: ENNOSUZ 3I ZE.US +52 234
#note Oh wait, she gave me this. Never mind.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: OW J14 WO +26 232
>Jason: DLNNOSS 4J L.NO +16 250
#note Yeah, there are better plays, but I really, really didn't want to telegraph that I had the case S. Plus, I wanted to create an opening.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AEFIW D3 WAIFE. +30 262
>Jason: ?ADINSS E5 DAN +24 274
#note Dream draw, and I miss all the bingos. SANDfISH and StANDISH at A1 are the star plays. This os only marginally worse than DIStAINS, DISdAINS or SIgANIDS at 12F and SANDhIS (which I know from the "WF study method") at N4. I was so flustered at this point, realizing I could well lose a game in which I drew ??SSS against an opponent I really wanted to beat by playing a phony four.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EY 3B YE. +18 280
#note At a three- or four-turn sequence around this point, as Henny Youngman might have said: "I thought I was in church! Every draw, Robin muttered 'Jesus Christ!'"
>Jason: ?FIRSSU L11 IF +22 296
#note With three R's out, I now agree with Speedy to play RIF for four more. (Why do the games in which I lose a challenge invariably become neck-and-neck?)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EEG M9 GEE +9 289
#note Ah, there are the E's I can't draw. Good block, but I started to calm down a bit here. Ahead, on turn, and even though bingoing will be tough, I can outrun if needed.
>Jason: ?BIRSSU 9F BU. +17 313
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: EE B2 E.E +12 301
#note More of the E's I can't draw.
>Jason: ?INORSS N8 SONSIeR +77 390
#note Good time to pick the O. "I'm shocked you have a vowel," Robin said as I put this down. I declined to whine about the fact that I'd only drawn one E to her nine. :)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AAIR O7 RIA +19 320
#note Played ARIA, picked up the A. Obviously she doesn't have the X.
>Jason: EGLNRRT O13 REG +15 405
#note Ah, this is why she was surprised I had vowels. And, (buzz)! Why block DEX when she has umpteen X spots and, when I'd draw the P, give myself no endgame flexibility for so few points? Dumb. Should've played (E)RG at C3 or some other better play.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ADEIOTX A14 XI +36 356
>Jason: LNPRT F9 ..LT +6 411
#note Blocking OAT at 11E. Q agrees.
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: ADEOT F6 DO +24 380
>Jason: NPR 2A R.P +9 420
#note Somehow kept equity loss to 113.6 (after the 112.2 against Bradley ... there's that consistency I've been searching for!). I've done worse, but OMG am I still embarrassed. But hey! I'm 1-0 against Robin, and except for the fact that I posted this mess for all to see, nobody needs to know how!
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: AET G4 ATE +11 391
#note Flawless endgame from Robin. 2-0, with a spread lower than it should be. Bowman asked how I did, and I said "I played horribly!" His face fell and he groaned. "But I won," I said, and he immediately brightened. :)
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel:  (N) +2 393
