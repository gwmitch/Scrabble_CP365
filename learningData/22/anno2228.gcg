>Phil: AIILMNO 8D MILIA +20 20
#note When Quackle showed OI 8H as its top choice, I couldn't believe it so I decided to sim. Apparently, leaving AILMN bingos 41% of the time on the next turn, which I suppose is the reason why, after 16,183 iterrations (not a typo) at 2 plies, Quackle prefers it to my play of MILIA by .01 win percentage (tied in valuation). Anyone agree with me on this one? This is one of the closest sims I've seen.

>Quackle: BDEEHRV 12A BREVE. +28 117
>Phil: ADGILNO 9C GON.DIAL +78 140
>Quackle: DHHLNTY 11E H.TH +30 147
>Phil: ??EEGJT C11 J.E +20 160
#note This play was pretty bad. I like Quackle's choice of JIG 7E, which I didn't see. Interestingly, Quackle also places 5 choices above my play, 4 of which use a blank (such as oBJET A11 or TaJ D2). I guess scoring 39 with a blank is perfectly fine if you keep another one.
>Quackle: DELNRTY 14B TRENDY +39 186
>Phil: ??EGOPT 15A POsT +34 194
#note POsT loses the sim to PIG 7E, but beats out a bunch of low-60-point bingos through the L.
>Quackle: ELNORTU A8 UNRO.E +24 210
>Phil: ?CEEGGS 15G EGG +20 214
>Quackle: AAILOTT 13G TAO +12 222
>Phil: ?CENSSU B2 UNCaSES +72 286
#note USaNCES in the same spot is better, but I don't know the word; as a matter of fact, UNCASES was a bit of a guess.
>Quackle: AACILPT 8J APICAL +35 257
>Phil: AEEFILW D1 FLAW +42 328
#note 42 points is nice, but so is ALEWIFE 10I for 80.
>Quackle: EIKORST 1D .ORKIEST +95 352
>Phil: ADEEIOV 10J AVOID +20 348
#note AVOID outvalues OI 2J by almost 4 points, but loses about .3% more often. DEVOICE M3 is best by a mile, a word I don't know.
>Quackle: AENNRRY L8 .R.NY +16 368
>Phil: DEEFMQW 12I DEM. +13 361
#note How EF M12 wins 39% of the time I have noooo clue. DEMY sucked- lost me the game. I guess I should've been focusing on scoring because getting stuck with the Q was only up to the tile gods at this point.
