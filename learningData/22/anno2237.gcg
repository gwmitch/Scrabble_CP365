#note Phew- best. Thought this wouldn't sim well.

>Peter_Barkman: DU 10B DU. +8 87
>Phil: AELSSST J3 LASTS +35 93
#note After playing off OH, I drew SS. Don't know the word tassels (apparently common). Anyway, I seriously debated LAST vs. LASTS. LASTS kept a better leave (in my opinion, probably wrong) and opens the board a wee bit. LAST is nice because ATT takes no back hooks, so the board becomes really shut down. I guess I didn't want it to be closed having an s and all. Oh well, -3 valuation points.
>Peter_Barkman: ADEGLTU 5D TA. +20 107
>Phil: ABCENOS 2J BACON +44 137
#note Even if I saw BEACONS, which I didn't, I don't know the word CLAST anyway so I wouldn't have been able to play it. BANCO is better than BACON, but I don't know it.
>Peter_Barkman: ADP 1M DAP +23 130
>Phil: EEESVVY 3M EYE +26 163
#note Sure, the VV combo isn't great, but how the hell does EVES 13A sim better than EYE? Not only does it burn my S for just an extra point, but it opens a huge hot spot. Is it really worth it?
>Peter_Barkman: ??EGIRT 1D vERTIGo +76 206
>Phil: EENSVVW D3 VE. +12 175
#note Quackle's faves: EVEN 4B, Exch. EVVW, and NEW C12. I knew this played sucked.
>Peter_Barkman: OPU 6B UPO +14 220
>Phil: ELNOSVW F11 WOVEN +27 202
#note Don't know the word ELEVON (O3), but WOVE is second best. I guess I tacked on the N for a better leave and turnover. Besides, I'm losing so opening the triple at least gives me some potential scoring options.
>Peter_Barkman: GINORTW 14C TOW.RING +66 286
>Phil: EELRRSU 4A RUL. +5 207
#note Ok, this blew. ISSUER 7H is best, with LUV 3B and REVUE 3B behind it.
