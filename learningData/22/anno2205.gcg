#note 7G MOA quickly rises to the top of the sim, but I hate what it does to the board, leaving P and U to play through with a U in the leave, plus a few lines for low-scoring sevens.

#note Fishing for AZIDE for 75. AZAN's leave is revolting.

>Will: ADEINRZ 8K AZ..E +75 316
#note My fish worked, but now I have to choose among AZIDE for 75, a play from H11 (AZIDE 78 or AZINE 75), and RENDZINA for 74. I opted for 8K AZIDE to prevent Quackle from cashing in on the 8L spot for cheap points. I'm by no means sure that this is best, though. RENDZINA gives the best shot at turning over the blank, which is advantageous since Quackle will be up a tempo on me after its play.

#note EoNISMS is 7 more points, but too reckless for my taste. MiRINESS (or fIRMNESS) gives up almost no decent counterplay, aside from 14F bingos. LARKINESS is ahead of MiRINESS on the static evaluator, but a) I wasn't sure it was a word; and b) it's crazy.
