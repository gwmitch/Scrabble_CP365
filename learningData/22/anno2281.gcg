#note Sims best, beating out FUBS.

>Matthew: EGHOSSS 8A GOSH +45 61
#note Sims best. GOSHES* is a phony.
>Ross: EHY 10B HEY +26 98
>Matthew: ENOSSVY K4 ENVOYS +32 93
#note ENVOY(S) C3 does indeed sim slightly higher. The third highest simming play is one I did not consider. ENVOY at 10J looks very interesting.
>Ross: ?CEEGIT 5E EjECTI.G +70 168
>Matthew: AAAIMSX F9 .XIA +27 120
#note Sims best. There is no really good way to unload two A's, but AMAS A7 is close.
>Ross: KNOW E11 KNOW +36 204
>Matthew: AAJLMSV 15A JAVAS +60 180
#note Best without question.
>Ross: IQ 11A QI +16 220
>Matthew: ?ILMOOU E2 MOU. +6 186
#note The bingo is MOdIOLU(S) which I had no prayer of seeing. MOU(E) is a weak attempt to fish and open the board. With this play, all the bingo lines are potentially blockable with one play. The best non-bingo play is simply (FE)U at 8G.

#note My attempt to block up the bingo lane and unload some double letters. It's not bad, but DURRA(S) and (FE)UD both sim better. Not sure if Quackle takes into account the fact that my opponent is quite clearly setting up a bingo. But I think ORA does much better due to that fact.

#note I just don't know PANDOUR(S). That sucks.
