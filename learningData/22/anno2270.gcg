#note What the fuck? I actually spent time considering LEG 10E and CRY, and went with the wrong choice of course. Plays like this make me feel so bad at Scrabble. I guess keeping four consonants isn't terrible here given the bag. ZAG G8 is best, and TEG 10E and CLERGY K1 are also good choices.

#note YARE L11 is best. Dunno why I needed to add the R. Alyssa held for a while.

#note Champ Player likes TO 6A. The problem with that is that she'll obviously block, and the sim doesn't take that into account. I considered TOP H2, which wins more than VITA according to the sim. However, if she has the S, I'm more than screwed. In the game, she would have slapped down WHINS 1D 63. TOP might be a smart gambit, though.
