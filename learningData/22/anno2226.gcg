#note didn't even think about RAJAH.
>cd: ENRT H8 .TERN +15 109
#note judging from this play, giving him rajah to play through may have given him a bingo.  we love hindsight.

#note i didn't like any of my choices here. i saw quackle's top picks of pot or pet (7c), but wasn't excited about three vowel leaves.  i thought a little more board opening might be good.  who knows.

>cd: DEEHIST J8 HEISTED +74 273
#note 11 more points at 3A, but maybe this board is better for him now that he has a lead?
>k8: ABBENTW C5 B.B. +23 231
#note not quite how i was hoping the trade would work out
>cd: ADEGGL K4 LAGGED +26 299
#note he said afterwards that he didnt' want to open up the board by playing HAGGED or HAGGLE.  i don't think it's worth sacrificing the points here.

#note i'm pretty sure i've lost at this point. didn't see (HE)AVEN, which is the other top choice in the sim...

>k8: ELNOPTT 8M .OT +15 273
#note quackle hates my play. i like that it at least gives me a lane other than SPORED.
>cd: AAAIIIUU -AAI +0 330
#note you'd assume he has a blank, right?  he doesn't -- he told me he drew it on last racks. i have no idea what his real rack was.
>k8: EFLNPTU J2 ELF +22 295
#note Q says ENUF at J1. that's the super-crazy hail mary, i guess. ELF gives me the only hook that isn't a blank, so if for some reason he doesn't have one, i can play there next turn. of course, i'm sure he has a blank...
>cd: AIIIRUU 4D .IA +5 335
#note i have no idea what to make of that play. with 11 unseen, if he doesn't have a blank, there has to be something better to do than play two tiles and block that lane.
>k8: INPTUUY 1J PUNITY +45 340
#note i really did think it was a word! he was low on time, still working on a rack that looked bingo prone... didn't hold.
>cd: EILNORT 2M TOE +17 352
#note no idea whether this was his rack, but it was close.  i'm guessing he had either EILNORT (trotline) or AELNORT (tolerant).
>k8: ?AIRUUV 1H Im...... +36 376
#note i have a play that gives me a 100% win percentage. i wouldn't have thought much of it if i had seen it, but it does give me an out in two and keeps him from playing the Im front hook. my play is second best.
>cd: ?AILNRR 14H LA. +13 365
#note three choices give him a 100% win. he goes three minutes over looking for something. i'm guessing he spent most of the time looking for bingos, but a small play would have done it, considering my leave.
