#note Yeesh, I rushed this play.  VEX and VEXT are obviously better.

#note The other placement is much more dangerous in both the O1 and O8 spots.  In my opinion it is not worth the four extra points...
>Joe: IIIIIOO -IIIIIOO +0 136
#note ...but if I had known he was going to do that.
>Dave: AENOOTU O6 TOO +23 193
#note Four T's and two N's unseen.
>Joe: AIR O1 AIR. +27 163
>Dave: AENORUU D8 U.EA +24 217
#note This is part of the right play, but I should have kept going with NOUVEAU.  Watch me get rewarded for my mistake.
>Joe: BIO C11 BIO +15 178
>Dave: AEMNORU C2 ENAMOUR +75 292
#note Placing the bingo at M8 is one more point, but there's no good reason to give him the S hook to row 15.
>Joe: AELO D1 ALOE +18 196
#note A funny draw for me, but a good one, as it takes away most of the ammunition for him to come back.  The ever present threat of TaJ B4 becomes important over the next several moves.

>Joe: DEEINTU M9 DETINUE +74 270
>Dave: ?EJKRTZ 15L Z.RK +81 413
#note Better than JEEZ or JERK because I'm still holding the letters for TaJ.
>Joe: AEILOST 14B ISOLATE +74 344
>Dave: ?EFJLNT H12 FE.L +33 446
#note An interesting moment.  I have JEEs H12, TaJ B4, Jo 4H, and JETLAG H1.  His best chance to come back is to bingo on row 11 or 12, so it's important to take those lanes away immediately by playing at H12.  With so many things to do with the J, there was no rush to play it right away.
>Joe: HU B5 UH +30 374
>Dave: ?JNOTWW A6 WOW +36 482
#note Careful now!  He had LICHTED on column A.
>Joe: CDEHILT 12K CH.LD +26 400

#note And I finally cash in the J.
