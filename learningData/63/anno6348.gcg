#note I was pumped for GR(E)W, but I'm pretty sure you have to cash the S here. too many tiles go next to MIR, and I am going to assume he has at least an E.

#note I'm feeling good here. I mean, it's not like he is going to bingo through the U and I will manage not to draw a bingo next to it, right?
>Dominick: ABDEILT B1 D.TIABLE +67 455
#note this seems to win 66-72% of the time. I3 (N)IL and (N)IB are up there. I guess in his position I'd take the bingo and hope for the best. I think there is an element of pride in these decisions though. Who wants to pass up a bingo for a play that wins more and run the risk of the scenario where the bingo WOULD have won.
