#note Joel: (annoyed) "Can you put the tile bag halfway across the table so I can reach it?" <sigh.>  Note: the tile bag was about two inches shy of center.

#note Joel: "hold please." (furrows brow, performs a few facepalms, grunts) "okay, challenge."Quackle: "TINING is acceptable"Joel: <GROOOOAAAAAAN>

#note -11.4 2H (I)F.  I sensed Joel's strategy shifting into damage control at this point.  I could be wrong, but I felt he wasn't going to let me bingo if I kept fishing, which is why I went ahead and did this.  After playing this I drew WPLCZ leaving a pile of garbage vowels for Joel.  I felt a shadenfreude tickle of excitement waiting for him to play, and hearing the impending <GROOOOAAAAN> when he drew AIU to his AEHU.
>Joel: AEG 12B GAE +18 235
#note Joel: <draws tiles> <just about falls out of chair>Me: "I couldn't believe it when I drew 5 consonants just there, this whole game has been kind of unreal. I drew everything."Joel: "Well this game has been very real for me.  More like a nightmare!  You must average 490 against me, I can't believe it."
>Jeremy: CLPSTWZ E10 C.ST +11 480
#note -50 equity!!! E10 C(I)S is that much better.  No matter. Still 100% to win.
>Joel: AAEHNUU B10 HA. +15 250
#note Funny, Quackle says the top move is B11 U(G)H.  HAG doesn't even register, but clearly Joel is off his game by now.
>Jeremy: ILPWZ C12 .LP +10 490
#note -19 J1 ZIP.  I'm getting too fancy with the endgame here, and miss how Joel can steal some points with this setup.
>Joel: AENUU A10 UN +9 259
#note 30 equity points better at C14.
>Jeremy: IWZ 14A ZI. +28 518
#note -10 H13 ZI(G).  I was getting low on time here and didn't look at that option.
>Joel: AEU A14 .A +33 292
#note 13C (L)U(T)EA gets Joel out with 4 more spread.
>Jeremy: W 6N W. +13 531
