>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEGLW B2 WEDEL +31 323
#note Took forever on this turn trying to figure out how best to close it up.  Champ sure took its sweet time, too.  It doesn't even pick WEDEL, but WE(T), WED, or GAW(K).  All of which I saw, but passed.  WEDEL sims so much better, too.  Lotsa Es coming, which initially sold me on the viability of the leave with the points.
