#note if lynn hadnt just played off a bunch of tiles after fishing for the last few turns then i may have gone with the slightly more defensive RESTATED/RETASTED.

>james: AAEEFIW D2 WAFE. +38 168
#note d1 WAIF and d3 AWA(R)E just edge out my play. better leaves.

#note these IIII's lay hidden for a few turns yet after i chuck them back

>james: DEIOQRY M2 QI +26 194
#note also liked 12j DORY or YOD.  i quite like those as i didnt really like setting up a bingo lane and a Q hotspot with all the III unseen.  playing QI k2 just felt weak
>lynn_cushman: DEELNRS N3 SLENDER +63 186
#note there's an 88 point bingo. if you can find it - it'w worth taking the time to try.
>james: DEFHORY O8 HEY +44 238
#note choose from a bunch of stuff to put here.
>lynn_cushman: LOX E1 LOX +27 213
>james: DFGLORS 2D ..G +11 249
#note ok. lynn took ages on the LOX play and after i'd factored in a few things, it seemed like a KI set up to me.   if i dont put this into the equation then it's a simple 12j FOLD play.  if you put KI into 'specify opps rack' then it easily sims best. G2 FORG(E) is also liked.  I dont know if my intution should be trusted......(lynn didnt have the K).
>lynn_cushman: AAIR 1E .AARI +18 231
>james: ADFLORS 11B FLORA +27 276
#note my A is probably too valuable here. should play FOLD instead.

#note or c11 (L)UV
>lynn_cushman: CINRU M9 INCUR +20 269
>james: ??IISTU 14G qIvIUTS +65 357
#note i'm not going to turn down the chance of playing QIVIUTS to try and find a better bingo in this spot (apparently 14d SUITING is best)
>lynn_cushman: CEOU 13A COU.E +16 285
>james: ABIIKTU A13 .UB +21 378
#note should've just played KIT 15f
>lynn_cushman: DEHJLT H13 H.D +21 306
>james: AIIKT 15A .ATIK +12 390
#note 13l I(R)K blocks lynn's best play (as it turns out i beat lynn for1st place by only 9 spread points, so i should've perhaps been more focussed during this endgame).
