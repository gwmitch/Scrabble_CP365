>Carl: ABOOTTU 8H ABOUT +16 16
#note Wisely chickening out on the plausible OUTBOAT* and the not-so-plausible AUTOBOT*. I didn't know ABOUTS#; fortunately, it didn't matter this time.
>Nick: AEKN L8 .AKEN +18 18
>Carl: DENOOTT M9 TONED +27 43
#note Another tough decision. Any of several plays in that spot wins the sim.
>Nick: EEINSTY 9C SYENITE +70 88
>Carl: AIOOTVW 8A AVO +20 63
#note Yet another difficult decision, but my choice here doesn't look so hot. I saw AVOW G7 and WOO K11, but I thought the 8A spot was too risky to leave. (In Collins, FY, NY, and KY are acceptable) Although it's cute to set up the W for D8, AVOW G7 sims much better.
>Nick: ?AFHIRS E7 FR.AkISH +76 164
>Carl: EIMOTUW N10 WET +38 101
#note Quackle prefers MEOW D12 and 13B OUTSWIM 13B, but that looks a bit myopic to me, expecially considering Nick's sense of board control.
>Nick: ABJS O7 JABS +50 214
>Carl: GIIMOUW D12 MOU +25 126
#note Best. Glad I talked myself out of MOUI*. It's MAOI# and MOOI# only.
>Nick: EEGR 15A GERE +25 239
>Carl: AAGIIOW D4 AGIO +15 141
#note Again, sim-leader WAI# C11 is too myopic. The board is already looking pretty congested. -6.
>Nick: CDENR B10 CENDR. +30 269
#note A Collins-only adjective, no hooks. For 5 points, why didn't I challenge?
>Carl: ADILOWZ A11 DA +10 151

>Carl: ?ILOUWZ C11 WIZ +72 223
#note This must be what sex feels like.
>Nick: ELMNNPV K6 PL.M +13 349
#note Passing up PLENUM to better ensure I don't bingo.
>Carl: ?LOORUY F9 .Y +26 249
#note I had no idea what to do here, but it turns out I missed OvUL(AT)ORY, which I didn't know. Maybe I should have tried (A)UROLOGY*. Against a lesser player, I'd give it a whirl.
>Nick: NNU B2 NUN +21 370
>Carl: ?FLOORU L4 FRO +16 265
#note Going for some kind of -FUL word. FLUOR(ENE) wins the sim, but it's all pretty much hopeless at this point.
>Nick: EIV M2 VIE +17 387
>Carl: ?AHLOPU E3 PHO +27 292
>Nick: ACIL 2J CLA.I +32 419
#note Taking out the very real possibility of a big Q play.
