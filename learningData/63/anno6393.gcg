#note Jeff originally put down POGonIA, maximizing score, which gave me JAMB for 54 coming back, so I was a little disappointed to see him change to this. But as you'll see, it'll all work out.

#note Jeff wanted to move the blank S in SOAPING so his bingo would fit. When he showed me HURDLIN, I so wanted him to play HURL/(OI)L. I would've bingoed out with SWEETLY, scored 646 (64.6 a turn, ahead of the tourney record and, if a club game, would've been second on that list behind Cresta's famous 830 in 12 turns for 69.2) and been maybe the only player ever to bingo on every single even-numbered turn. But Jeff saw the SWELTER/SWELTRY potential.
>Jason: EELSTWY N10 SWEETY +41 581
#note Then I was so mad Jeff didn't comply with my plans that I phonied him. :) STEWY here is correct, this is like 15-ish spread points behind.
