#note Arden Cup, May '10, round 19. Scott's racks unknown. Both Scott and I had a poor tourney, but this game was memorable, at least...

#note Argh. Not sure why I thought this took the -S. Missed EUCAINES at 11B, but found it next turn. ACEINSU + L = LUNACIES. Derp. This mistake, though, set into motion an interesting sequence...

#note Well now. Scott told me in his career to date, he had only played one triple triple in tournament play. I have no idea whether anyone has ever made 2 on consecutive plays prior to this, but there it is. Fantastico! This was also the high word of the tourney containing the letters in ARDEN. Scott also said that the bingos weren't anything cool, but who needs coolness when you score 354 points in 3 turns?!

>trashman: LN 7B L.N +3 482
#note Final recorded as 618-485. This was my high game of an otherwise pretty lousy tourney, even if it was 133 short of victory. It won the high loss prize. Scott had  never recorded a 600+ tourney game prior to this one, and it stood as high win for only one round, as Debbie Stegman's 631 game was recorded in the final round (against Scott). Another note: All TW squares were used, another rarity. Awesome game, Scott!!
