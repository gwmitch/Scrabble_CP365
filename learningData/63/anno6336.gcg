#note Seemed like a tough challenge. I thought it might be good, anyway. SmartEd.

#note Sure Quackle, Ill play HAO G13. Sounds like a great idea. I'll take the equity hit here.

#note I decided to open here and preserve the 14F X spot. I may need it to get back in this game. Gotta keep it volatile.
>Ed: AHPRY 14J HARPY +55 322
#note I held this for 12 minutes. Yes. 12 minutes. I was pretty sure it was good, but I had to decide if i had a good enough play to get me back in the game. This is where the game gets insane, if it isn't enough already.
>dacrON: ?EMNORZ 8A ZE. +42 256
#note sort of wanted to keep the 3x3 lane open and make him deal with it, but MNOR? is nice when there is AAAEEEEEEIIIII left. I figured down a bingo i could still catch up.
>Ed: AEGILRS M4 GLAIRES +68 390
#note ED! NO! MEANED! I'm sure he was thrilled to be held for 12 minutes with that rack lol

>Ed: BDENOUX --  -65 390
#note He played this instantly. I challenged instantly. I was pretty sure it was good. Go figure.
>dacrON: DEEGINX A10 DE.ING +33 381
#note I had about 3 minutes left here, so I had little time to factor in his rack. If I do factor in his rack, (A)X looks pretty cool, although I am not sure what I do when he blocks with D(R)IB. This is the best play if I don't know his rack, which given my time, is about what the situation was like. This play takes a hit given his rack because it gives him an insane play. Can you find it?
>Ed: BDDIMOR N2 DROID +34 424
#note So assuming almost nobody would find (N)IMROD low-ish on tme (or period), DE(W)ING isn't as bad as sim says it is.
>dacrON: EEIJVWX L1 JIVE +52 433
#note The game is unwinnable for me given optimal play, at this point. But that won't stop me from trying!
>Ed: AABEEMU 15M EAU +18 442
#note Ed has one winning play here. I will always wonder if I couldve found it.
>dacrON: EWX 8M .EX +30 463
#note This ties. (O)WE E(NO)W and (W(IS)E all win. I had 15 seconds on my clock after JIVE. I only had time to evaluate X plays before Ed played EAU, so I didn't want to risk (O)WE, although I did see it. Given how this game had gone, I was happy enough to have a tie. And leaving BAM open is a good distractor.
>Ed: ABEM 14D BAM +30 472
#note ...and it worked.

#note What a game.
