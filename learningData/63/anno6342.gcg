>Quackle: ADNRRSV -RV +0 0
>Matthew_Larocque: AADILMS H6 AMID +14 14
#note Simulation suggests exchanging an A is better than anything. Otherwise, ad and maid/amid are the best simming choices. My placement is apparently not optimal?
>Quackle: AADGNRS 7C GRAND.AS +67 67
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHLPSS 10B HAPLESS +80 94
#note Plashes... forgot that was a word, but it's also just asking to get burned. Plashe(r)s also opens the triple lane, for 4 more points. I think I'd still prefer hapless.
>Quackle: BGIIOUV D2 VIGOU. +20 87
>Matthew_Larocque: CCGNPUZ 9A CUP +22 116
#note I didn't feel like I HAD to play off the Z here immediately. Zinc could bite me back with zincy. I didn't want to keep doubled cees. I was debating either cup or c(l)ung, both which sim at the top, to my surprise. I didn't notice cu(i)ng, which has a very slight edge over the aforementioned plays.
>Quackle: ABDIOTT 2B BO.ID +30 117
>Matthew_Larocque: CGJNRRZ 5C C.Z +28 144
#note It's either coz or jog here... jog apears to be the better play. Z is certainly easier to work with, so I agree in hindsight.
>Quackle: AEEETTY F4 EYE. +27 144
>Matthew_Larocque: EGJNORR C9 ..RGO +16 160
#note This one had me stumped. I wasn't playing prong... no need to put myself in that much danger for no reason. I did think about ogre F1, and I did want to block that area. I just wanted to keep a vowel, although the bag does still have a fair amount of them. Dunno :/
>Quackle: AAEEITT 12B A.ITATE +18 162
>Matthew_Larocque: EHJNRTV 1E HENT +29 189
#note Hent or j(o)t is what it came down to, and I just felt that hent took out that dangerous area while scoring best and clearing off 3 consonants.
>Quackle: ?EEKNRU 9H .EbUNKER +68 230
>Matthew_Larocque: JNQRRVW -JWVQR +0 189
#note Now, this.... this is a rack. Quackle likes keeping just R. Whenever I do something like that I end up getting like 5 vowels.
>Quackle: EEMOOTU O4 METEO. +33 263
>Matthew_Larocque: ABENRWY N8 B.WEARY +50 239
#note Sure glad I found that, because I wasn't finding ANYTHING for awhile besides way or yaw for 36.
>Quackle: EIOORTU A4 EROTI. +27 290
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNOV 12L OV. +12 251
#note Surprised... I was sure I'd miss a bingo here, but there's nadda. I felt I needed to hang onto the last E.. and generally try to keep my rack in bingoable shape. That's why I didn't play vainer. Vino at N1 simulates best, followed by viola(s), then avion at N1.
>Quackle: ?FJOQSU I12 SUQ +22 312
#note Oh snap, what's Quackle trying to pull here? Must have the blank.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFILLN J13 NIL +20 271
#note Well, I wasn't playing leaf for 39. Not with that dangling hook of death, and a j/x/? not in my possession.
>Quackle: ?DFIIJO L3 DIsJOI. +30 342
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFILRT O12 LEAF +39 310
#note Leaf has a 1% winning chance, disjoint/ta(w) is 1.5%. Good game, Q.  Also, despite eyeing that nook under bovid, it completely escaped me that Q could cash the X there. : /
>Quackle: AFLNNOX C1 F.X +44 386
>Matthew_Larocque: IRTW K1 WRIT +12 322
#note Wri(s)t surely isn't that hard to find!
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ALNNO) +10 332
#note Got beat soundly, but I seemed to have played decently with what I had. Didn't miss any bingos... apparantly I only had the one? I've beaten Quackle, while playing much worse than I did here!
