>Killer_Matthew: DIOOW E3 WOODI. +20 20
#note table talk here, Matthew says "You don't know how bad I needed you to play an R".  I guess IRONWOOD?  And get the nod.  Infer that Mattew kept ON.
>Jeremy: BEEPSTU F2 BEEP +25 47
#note -3.7 3C BE(W)EPT.  Didn't see it.
>Killer_Matthew: KNOT D1 KNOT +38 58
>Jeremy: FLOSTUZ 1A ZOU.S +54 101
#note -5.9 1A ZOU(K).  Keep the S.  Yeah, oops.  I thought it had to have the S.
>Killer_Matthew: AEU G7 A.UE +7 65
>Jeremy: FLORRTU F10 FURL +28 129
#note -2.6 F10 FLUOR or FLOUR.  Don't like giving up the triple lane here personally.

>Jeremy: IJNOOQU K4 QU.I +26 284
#note 6B QUO(D). -15.2  Normally I'd play 10B JOE, but this is fishing.  I want to block the 2x2x lane. Too paranoid, and a bad leave.
>Killer_Matthew: ADEELRS L7 DEALERS +71 301
>Jeremy: DEGJNOO 11K J.ON +22 306
#note -3.2 10J DOLE.  I like JEON for throwing the NG ending possibility out there.
>Killer_Matthew: AILT L2 ALIT +32 333
>Jeremy: ?DEFGIO I12 OF +20 326
#note On Many Ply, this is the play of choice.  Matthew thinks B12 DEF(I) is really good, but I think he's biassed because he is looking at how useless his own rack is there.  We did one post-DEFI "fake draw" and my next rack came up with bingos in 2 places.  A6 wINDIGO or N8 pOINDI(N)G would have played with that draw.  Wondering what's really best here.
>Killer_Matthew: AX 14A AX +38 371
>Jeremy: ?DEGGIR N5 dREDGI.G +64 390
#note 47% to win.  Quack says A1 (ZA)G is 75.48% to win, but it's lying.
>Killer_Matthew: ACDEMPV 2K P.VED +22 393
#note This is the only play that wins.
