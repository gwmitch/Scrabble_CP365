>Ryan_Fischer: EILOSSU 6F .OU +6 38
#note If I'd've played the more risky (Y)OU, I'd've bingoed (if he didn't have one that blocked it).  Oh well.
>David_Gibson: U -U +0 14
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILNSS I6 SI +10 48
#note Q says just dump the S for (YOU)S.  A bit risky.  Then again, SI isn't that far off.  Q also suggests SI creating the (YONI)C spot.  Nah.
>David_Gibson: ER J5 RE +14 28
#note Bizarre.  It's frightening getting into a fishing duel with him.  Just waiting for things to explode...
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELLNS 9F DEAL +24 72
#note Decided not to play anymore games.  Best.
>David_Gibson: HOP 10H POH +26 54
>Ryan_Fischer: ILNNSTU -LUN +0 72
#note Absolutely nothing appealing.  Of course he didn't open an 8 line I could use.
>David_Gibson: AOTU 11J AUTO +13 67
#note Phew.
>Ryan_Fischer: INRSSTU 11E NUTS +17 89
#note Oops, missed L5 INTRUS(T)S 68.
>David_Gibson: NR K11 .RN +3 70
#note Again?  Okay...

#note 13H RHI(N)AL 26?

>Ryan_Fischer: ??AMNPR 15C RAMPiNg +97 301
#note 15F RAMP 50 is tempting, but so is going up a bingo on him.  Best, happily.
>David_Gibson: BCIT C3 BITC. +24 251
>Ryan_Fischer: DEGGOTV 8L DO.E +30 331
#note I didn't write down this whole rack, so I'm guessing.  Clunky leave, but I needed to take this spot.
>David_Gibson: ELU 14D LEU +17 268
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEGGTV 3L EGG +12 343
#note Taking out the last real line.  Hindsight: Oops, T(RAMPING).  *gulp*
>David_Gibson: IJ F2 JI. +27 295
>Ryan_Fischer: DEERTVX 9K VEX.D +47 390
>David_Gibson: ITW B13 WIT +22 317
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIORTT C9 TRITE +22 412
#note Q likes TOIT a little better than my plays.  It was what I was gonna play before he opened that spot.  Was worried about a high-scoring 6 at the triple, but I don't see too many.  BENAME, maybe.  Nothing with the K?
>David_Gibson: AEEFKMN D1 KEEF +46 363
#note Oh yeah, shoulda blocked KEEF.  That's what TOIT did.  And TRITE actually OPENS BENAME.  Eesh.  I was low on time, but no excuse.
>Ryan_Fischer: BIO B1 BIO +15 427
#note Well, I was waiting for it to explode, and explode, it did.  I can't count how many times I've been neck and neck with him only for him to get to the blank first, so this was kinda nice (although overkill).  Also: I shorted myself 11 points somewhere.  Weird.  I can't add.
