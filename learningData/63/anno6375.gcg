#note back in the day you couldn't pay me to keep AER, but nowadays i always do this. keeping ER though sims slightly better. sometimes keeping the two vowels sims better. for which racks? -1

>Cesar: AEIPRUV 8G VAU +12 12
#note i am extremely tempted to pass again but it doesn't seem right. quackle prefers the 8G placement with no inferences, but i didn't think enough about it. probably 8H is the most defensive in terms of getting a bingo down, and 8F may be the best way to ensure we don't hit the triple. ?

#note it literally took me 5 minutes to find this. that didn't seem like a good sign.

#note at a restaurant later, david asked us what we thought of overzeal, and everyone said they hated it. i was about to say "it's good" but then i didn't want to look dumb, and then i started thinking maybe i was making it up. but it is good! silly word.
>Cesar: AAEFORT 14J FEAT +35 136
#note i remember deciding between OAF at 14L and FEAT. i mistakenly thought that AERT was not worth 8 points more than AOR. it just didn't seem THAT strong, but i thought it'd be fairly close. i was wrong! it's much stronger than that. -5

#note RAMONA easily puts me back in the game. challenging a valid word doesn't. i just didn't recognize it, nor did i think of ovaritic*. when i wrote down the alphagram, victoria did jump out at me, but i didn't know if it was because he had just played it on me. i decided that i would have a better memory of it if it was a word. the problem is i've been through this range a couple of times and i must have just typed in the word and forgotten about it. i hate scrabble. -32.5
