>Ryan_Fischer: EFIOQRT 8G QI +22 22
>Winter: ADEEHSS I5 DEASHES +78 78
>Ryan_Fischer: EFOOORT H10 FOOTER +37 59
#note Missed 11E FOOT(S)ORE 94.  Whoops.
>Winter: AACEINS 13F ES.ANCIA +74 152
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AINOSX 14B sAXONI.S +90 149
#note I figured.  OX just barely surpasses sAXONI(E)S.  I figured I just needed to get back in it, and the 90 that brought would bring me to even.  I guess the blank is worth more than 47 here.
>Winter: EGLMOTU M7 OUTGLE.M +63 215
#note Don't quite understand the placement.  (That's bongo.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ABIIIRU H1 URBIA +27 176
>Winter: AELNPTY L1 PENALTY +85 300
#note Hi, Irving!
>Ryan_Fischer: EGIIKOR 1L .IKI +30 206
>Winter: ?ELNOTW B7 tOWNLET. +61 361
#note TOWNLE(s)(s) is a bit more; Q suggests OW for 35.  Obviously Q isn't familiar with the term for 5 bingos in a row.  Neither am I!
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGOPRZ 8A G.OP +30 236
#note Score, fish for ZEI(N) for 71.  There are a lot of plays that valuate better, but there aren't many lanes left now either way.
>Winter: DDGHNOO J9 OH +35 396
#note He put down (T)HO first, then saw HO, blocking a potential ZEIN play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEERVZ 12A Z.BRA +52 288
>Winter: DDEGMNO L12 D.M +24 420
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEEIRV N1 .EEVE +24 312
#note Best shot I have at getting back into it.
>Winter: DEGINOY O5 DOGY +30 450
>Ryan_Fischer: CEIIRVW 3J WI.C.R +22 334
#note I guess it's better to keep the R even with two unseen?  That can't be.  I like WINCER, not WINCE.
>Winter: ADEFINN J6 FA +28 478
#note He started to play F(I)N, then played FA.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIJRRV 2B ARRIVE. +36 370
#note JA(R) seems dumb.  ARRIVE(R) has the chance of sticking me with the J.  But I wanted the points and to save spread.
>Winter: DEILNNT B2 .N +2 480
#note Blocking T(A)J/setting up DENTIL; didn't see JU(G).
>Ryan_Fischer: JTUU A6 JU. +12 382
>Winter: DEILNT 4A DENTIL +21 501
>Winter:  (TU) +4 505
