>Jim_Burlant: CEIRSTU 8C ICTERUS +74 74
#note It's impossible to double the C without vowel placement issues.  Q agrees - this is the best choice, with the other option being CURITES 8D.
>Mike_Early: CIINO D7 I.ONIC +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: LLMOOST 7H MOL +13 87
#note You have to know the bingo to play it -  TIMOLOLS (the 7 is probability 16335 and the 8 is > 20000) plays at 11 C and scores 70.  If you don't know the bingo, the options suck.  Anything that scores better than this is very dangerous and probably gives back a lot more than it gets.  This choice sucks.
>Mike_Early: EIIX 10D .IXIE +28 48
>Jim_Burlant: ALNOSTW K5 WOT +18 105
#note Again, no really good options, but that 2x2 seemed like a sitting duck, and this set up my S depending on the next draw.  Q doesn't like this a whole lot, preferring E8 TWIN.
>Mike_Early: EEFM L2 FEME +23 71
#note And Mike throws me a lifeline.
>Jim_Burlant: AILNRSS 3G RAINL.SS +70 175
#note The only bingo, and it wins just shy of 88% in a short sim.
>Mike_Early: DGR H1 GR.D +24 95
>Jim_Burlant: DNNORTT M5 TORN +11 186
#note Once again, another post-bingo rack that doesn't have any scoring options available.  This doesn't show up in the kibbitzer's original options, but this winds up being one of the two best plays I can make from an extraordinarily weak lot.
>Mike_Early: Q 7C Q. +42 137
>Jim_Burlant: BDDFNRY 11C D.F +24 210
#note Tempted to throw back in, but the 24 pts barely make this worth playing through.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Mike_Early: ?AENRSV -?AEN +0 137
>Jim_Burlant: BDEJNRY F3 BEND +22 232
#note Pretty appropriate hook for me to make given how I've played for much of this day.  Either this or BRED are best.  For some reason Q prefers BRED by almost 2 points despite RNN unseen.
>Mike_Early: ?DEENOT N8 ENDnOTE +74 211
#note A little risky for Mike to make this play, and he wondered at the time if he should have.  Q agrees that he was right to be concerned - L8 ENDnOTE sims nearly 2 points ahead of this despite giving up 5 points on teh scoreboard.
>Jim_Burlant: AAAAJRY M11 AJAR +38 270
#note No, Quackle, not JAY M12 - be serious.  Not that AAY is a great leave, but as far as I'm concerned it's still better than AAAR, and  the defensive position of this play makes it much better than giving an S hook with S? unseen and me having just drawn a pile of dung.  
>Mike_Early: GPU O6 PUG +30 241
>Jim_Burlant: AAALTTY O11 AY +28 298
#note Despite the hideous leave, this is best - none of the other options scores more than 20.
>Mike_Early: AAEHHNY -AAEHH +0 241
>Jim_Burlant: AALSTTV 1H .AT +4 302
#note Yet another rack where I can't score more than 23 points with ANY possible play, and the only plays that score more than 16 require me to burn the S.  Predictably, Q does not like this at all.  But, given that Mike just turned 4, I guessed that he was trying to draw into an ING bingo, and defending that was my first priority.   Best play here per the sim is L13 TAV, which doesn't do much but balance a rack on a board that only has some limited bingo potential.  Perhaps LAVA 11H to block a possible EVZONE?  I dunno.
>Mike_Early: AIZ 14J ZAI.. +34 275
>Jim_Burlant: AEELSTV 15H VEAL +34 336
#note My previous position may have been a head scratcher, but this one's a no-brainer.  This is clearly best, and if  Mike can't bingo on row 5 this very turn, this game is probably over except for the final score.
>Mike_Early: OR 12B RO. +8 283
>Jim_Burlant: BEEIIST 13A BET +20 356
#note Worried (probably too much so) about his trying to hit a bingo with a blank C.   Sim winner is FEEB 2L; this is at the bottom of the heap.  This was the right idea with the wrong execution, as I probably should have played BEE for better rack balance (if you could call it that.).
>Mike_Early: GHOOPVY -GHOOP +0 283
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIOSU 2L .OU +18 374
#note  I was tempted to play OI E4, but didn't like the possible 40-point comebacks at D1.  Turns out this was a good choice - it's best.
>Mike_Early: EPW 14B PEW +31 314
>Jim_Burlant: EEHIILS E4 HI +19 393
#note The right idea with the wrong execution.  HEIST in the same location scores 40.
>Mike_Early: ?AHKOUY 15A HO +21 335
>Jim_Burlant: EEILSVY D1 VIES +34 427
#note Best, leaving me multiple outs.
>Mike_Early: ?AAGKNU 1A KNA.e +33 368
#note Best play for Mike.
>Jim_Burlant: ELY 9H LEY +17 444
#note Best.
>Jim_Burlant:  (AGU) +8 452
