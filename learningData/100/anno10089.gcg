>James: DEEINOT 8H ODE +8 8
#note I *never* know what to do with this rack - the 'close but no 6 letters is actually that great to have, nor are most 5 letter leftover racks'. Quackle's opinion varies but it seems that it likes exchaging, E, O or EO most but by a very small margin. I just wanted to try and make an open board and set it up for the future. That being said, my play is rated worse than the exchanges by a margin that's not totally negligible. *shrug* 
>Ed: IRRW J5 WRI.R +10 10
>James: DEHIINT K2 HIDE +26 34
#note I was secretly hoping Ed would play parallel to ODE on the bottom, making an ER, so I could play INHERITED. That being said, it's a tossup as a best move between HIDE, WITH/WIDTH/WHIT/WHID 5J, and HIE K3. I kind of like WITH because it allows for WITHE as a hook, but I kind of favored just taking the points for now. 
>Ed: ORTW 2J W.ORT +38 48
>James: EILNSTX 1N EX +29 63
#note I wasn't sure what to do here, because I liked holding the E for a bingo. But I decided the points were worth it too much. Quackle agreed. 
>Ed: BFOR G6 FORB +18 66
>James: ILNOQST F5 QI +20 83
#note Best. 
>Ed: ADLOU 1F DOULA +23 89
>James: ALNOSST L4 ON +16 99
#note I *knew* I was missing something here. SANTOLS/STANOLS. Sigh. 
>Ed: ?ACIRRZ 2A CRAZIeR +88 177
>James: AILNSST 10A INSTALS +71 170
#note Best but notice - this is a 32% win by quackle. STANOLS last turn was a 70%. The reason is because this gives Ed the momentum advantage. 
>Ed: BNT A9 B.NT +7 184
#note I'm very lucky he had nothing this turn. 
>James: EGMNOTT C1 M.GNETO +22 192
#note I was a little crazy on playing off letters because I was paranoid or a parallel play using ZA. That being said, MAGNETO isn't a bad play because it does clear the rack well. 

Quackle does suggest OCTET A1 or ROTTE M2. Both leave the GMN leave which isn't bad if I draw an I, and ROTTE makes a good opening for it. OCTET is favored slightly over ROTTE, MAGNETO and ROTTEN. 
>Ed: AINT A1 A.TIN +24 208
>James: DEELTUY M2 .UED +22 214
#note I missed REEDY M2 but I think playing for leave and RUED was fairly okay. Having a Y for scoring purposes isn't a bad thing, and there are two more Us in the bag. However, there are also six Es, meaning it's in my interest to try and dispose of Es too.

Quackle likes REEDY most, then RUED. 
>Ed: AEU 9A .EAU +14 222
>James: AEILTVY E7 VIT.E +23 237
#note I chickened out of DATIVELY I8 - I thought I was just trying to contort NATIVELY to work with a D. Not counting it, Quackle recomments TIVY 12A and VITAE afterwards. 
>Ed: ?EEGIOS 13A SOIGnEE +73 295
>James: AAILMOY D2 .OA +31 268
#note Well, I deserved the hole I got into. Best. 
>Ed: H 8D H. +19 314
#note This is the kind of play I'm not sure about - I really wonder what Ed's other tiles were. HUT scores, but I am not sure if it's worth it if I put the pressure on and he has no other good tiles. 
>James: ACEILMY 3G CAY +23 291
#note And I chicken out AGAIN. MYCELIA is good, and I thought it was just MYCELIAN. I also chickened out of AMYLIC 12G. 

I really don't deserve to be anywhere close this game. The problem is that Ed was starting to run low on time. I reasoned that if I could draw another A, I could play AM G4 or some other cheap play and keep catching up and perhaps catch him off time. 
>Ed: GY F12 G.Y +15 329
#note A good play, to block up my bingo chances. 
>James: AEEILMP 12F .APE +12 303
#note This is a really tricky play. I decided to play GAPE to make Ed think more and maybe go over time. AM 4G no longer could win me the game in present circumstances, nor could any other moves that don't open the board like ME 4H. 
>Ed: AKU 11I AUK +16 345
>James: EFILLMP C12 F.L +6 309
#note Ed had just run over time. I noted I had IMPEL 12K if I had to rely on it and with this play Ed would be stuck surrendering JV to me. 
>Ed: EJNSV L11 SEN +14 359
>James: EILMP 15A LIMP +42 351
#note Ed completely started to fall apart at this point. He was at 0:59 left. So I decided to make him play one more turn to see what he could do. 
>Ed: JV 7B J. +9 368
#note Had he played on L1, he'd have a tie... he played that quickly. 
>James: E I8 .E +7 358
>James:  (V) +8 366
#note However, he missed it (I guess that's the magic of playing upside down, since that meant the top corner O was so far from him) and I got to go out, have him lose 10 points on time, and win 366-358.

This was not a good game on my part - I should've won this with ease, but somehow I did win it anyway. It's a study in not giving up when you are making a pile of bad mistakes.
