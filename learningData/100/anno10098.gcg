#note Can't say I knew STOPT. Quackle of course doesn't want me to trade, but like, this Q is in the way! About 4.5 back of (B)OTTS, which I considered.

#note This is the point where G(ERMINES)S is definitely the best play. I challenged this word because it is ridiculous. Assuming I miss the star play here, maybe I should just ignore it and play SW(A)G. I know it blocks the board, but I've got an outside shot at Z plays in the bottom right, and given the tournament situation, I want to stay ahead of Jesse on spread. It's early enough in the game to still open later. Definitely not a good time to challenge. I think I was primed to want to challenge his suspicious words because he'd played PANINOS* earlier.

#note So I thought of ATRA(ZIN)E, but thought it needed two Os. I was definitely too preoccupied with trying to play damage control here, and spaced on that best play.

#note So I'm not going to win the game here, but now I've got a shot to keep my spread above his. This is my 6th game, but his 5th, so I'll be 5-1, and Jesse 5-0. He'd have to beat Peter in the 6th round to win outright.
>JD: AGGIINS I3 G.. +7 368
#note Only block. Ironically, the 2nd best play is G(ERMINES)S!

#note I bet you can guess what the best play is.

#note As it turns out, Jesse lost to Peter in the final round, so I qualified for BoB 2013! yay! :)
