#note Yeah, that's the way to start. Gave up after spending 3 or 4 minutes unable to find any of the bingos, as I just couldn't process the II? combination.  REPTILIA is the obvious play here.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: FFU 6H .UFF +20 46
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILLOT K4 LO.T +14 19
#note 2 for 2.  Any number of good bingos here, LOFTLIKE, FELLATIO, JOLLIEST, OUTWILLED.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EILNOO 9B EIdOLON +74 93
#note The duplicated O's restrict this rack, and the only other playable bingo is OINOmEL L7.  This is just about 25% to win.  While I've done everything in my own power to throw this game away to this point, the tile gods will ensure I have absolutely no chance the rest of the way.

>Jim_Burlant: BGIPSUX 12I B.UX +26 119
#note A sign of just how bad the day has been - I draw the X and can't land so much as an A, E, or O to go with it, landing low prob tiles and the two lowest probability vowels in this pool to go with it.  Was blinded by the presence of the U and gave up a little too much to unload it.  Best is apparently GIPS L3 if the sim is to be believed.  This guves up a little too much to unload the U.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EE 12E .EE +4 151
#note These are the kind of plays Sam is known for - mid-game, he'll just start dinking tiles for 4 or 5 points and not seem to accomplish anything.   His mindset is that he knows I need the E's, so he'd rather dump them cheaply than throw them back into the bag to let me have at them.  I dunno - I'd have to see his rack, but I have to believe he'd be better off exchanging than doing this.
>Jim_Burlant: GIMPQRS L2 GRIM +22 141
#note Mediocre play - I didn't want to burn the S just yet, though I probably should have for the extra 17 points.  But I've played Sam enough to know that he'll probably be dinking tiles off for another couple of turns.  I'm back up to 28%.  Q wants me to play L3 QI.  I don't like that because if he has an I, I play for 26 and gave back more than that when I'm already trailing.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: E G8 ..E +10 161
>Jim_Burlant: ELNPQSY 13I Y.P +27 168
#note Couldn't think of PYIN.  Q wants me to just dump the Q for 11.  I'd rather turn 2 tiles than 1 and score more points.  I have 2 places for QI so I don't think the Q is the priority.  I've climbed back to 35% winning chances in a short sim...but that's about to take a dive.

>Jim_Burlant: ELNQSSU M5 SUQ +27 195
#note Best is a bunch of row 13 plays I didn't see.  This is 4th or 5th best, and I was hoping to make it easier for msyelf to not have to start a bingo in S.  In reality I probably screwed myself with this choice, not that I was getting much help with the tiles either.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: E L11 E. +9 242
>Jim_Burlant: AAELNST D12 AL +16 211
#note Probably should have played ALAN, which wins 35%.  This wins 28.  Was hoping for an I, but hs next rack sealed the win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?DIORST 4A DI.eSTOR +74 316
#note Sam cannot bingo without slotting the 3x3.  He's winning 98%.
>Jim_Burlant: AEENSTW 8M SEW +31 242
#note Q likes WE(E) 14H.  This probably wasn't so good, but I wanted to open up a line he wouldn't be able to shut down so easily without sacrificing scoring.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IZ 2J ZI. +33 349
>Jim_Burlant: AELNNOT F12 .NOL +9 251
#note Desperation - the only way I see I can win is if I keep the threat of a 3x3 alive.  This is hemorrhaging spread, but that's irrelevant at this point.  q likes 8A LOTAH, but that's only going to stem the bleeding.  I need a 3x3 if I'm going to pull the miracle comeback and win this game.  This isn't one of the original choices, but it does percolate up and sim decently.
