#note Obvious exchange situation; Q says this exchange is best, with exchange AAOO and AAIOO trailing this by less than one point.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IU J8 .UI +6 36
>Jim_Burlant: AEEELSZ 7G LEZ +47 47
#note Too many points available compared to the plays with more turnover (only 3 other options score 30+) to not take this.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: HOTU 11J THOU +19 55
>Jim_Burlant: AACEELS K4 LACE. +16 63
#note There are no 7's in this rack, and the only 2 8's are ESCALADE and ESCALATE, and they don't play.  I toyed with LACEY but a smidgen of doubt crept in:  I worked with a gal named Lacey a few years back and couldn't remember if LACEY was legit or if it was only her name, so I opted for safety in favor of this.  HAving said that, there was no need to break up this rack.  Looking at the kibbitzer options, AE 12K (which I didn't see at the time)  looks like the best play out of a lot that doesn't have any really good scoring options.  Sure enough, the sim confirms - 12K AE should have been the play.  This wasn't awful, per se, but like I said, there was no need to turn the tiles here.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: MY 12K MY +31 86
>Jim_Burlant: AEMPSSV 3H VAMP +23 86
#note Predictable - Q prefers 3K PAVES and 3K PAVE, with this as a solid bronze medalist.  I didn't like PAVE because of all the easy back hooks (DRRRRRRSS still unseen), and the problem with PAVES was that it telegraphed the fact that I had two S's in my rack.  Short term, this worked out.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIV H1 VI.E +33 119
>Jim_Burlant: AEORSSX L3 SOX +45 131
#note At 1300+ 2-ply iterations, Q prefers (ZA)X I7  by roughly 2 points.   WHY????  It doesn't balance the rack. And it takes away the potential S hook at 9H, thus somewhat devaluing the S's that are still left.  As far as I'm concerned, there are way too many positives to my play of SOX to consider anything else.  Besides its 45-point score, SOX leaves AERS leave with IIIIIIINNNNNNTTTTT unseen.  Lastly playing the S gave me 14 more points than OX L4;  even if it was my only S, there were so many more points available with SOX than OX, that, even if it was my only S, it would have been the right decision to play it off.  This play doesn't telegraph that I'm sitting on another S. 
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AANNORT -AAN +0 119
>Jim_Burlant: ABCENRS 4D BRAC. +18 149
#note The BCN draw was definitely NOT what I was looking for, and I guess I got rattled.  CAB 6F was definitely the play. With RRRRR unseen Quackle docks me 10 points, primarily for 3 reasons:  ENRS vs. ENS; 3 extra scoreboard points for CAB; and most importantly, setting up the S hook down the E column that he really can't block if he doesn't have an S.  This isn't an awful play per se, but just like my play of LACED a couple of turns ago, it needlessly turns a 4th tile and I don't set myself up as effectively as I could with my play.  Quackle's suggestion of CAB is definitely the A+ play; I give this a B-.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EKNW 6E KNEW +22 141
>Jim_Burlant: EEFJLNS 2G F.LE +17 166
#note Brain dysfunction.  LIFE in the same spot scores 3 more.  Apparently, Q thinks the best play is to fish/dump the J off with JOY or M9 JEU.  No thanks.  I'm still winning 62% but am about to blunder away a lot of my winning chances.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EIJNST 9B INkJETS +73 239
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIJNST --  -73 166
#note I call bullshit on the dictionary here.  If INKJET is good (i.e., an inkjet printer), how the hell is this NOT good?   Best bingo is 9B INJECTS, and I cannot figure out why on earth I liked this in favor of INJECTS.   I guess I passed up JITNEYS because I wanted the extra point.  I honestly thought this was good.  Even if I don't !#% up this turn, I'm not quite 50% to win according to the duck. Pissing my turn away wins not quite 30.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEFITT O1 FATTIE +36 252
#note Sam spent a LONG time on this turn, and he told me after the game he realized he didn't have a way to block my bingo of INJECTS.  I wasn't paying very much attention when he was putting this down, as I was too relieved that  he hadn't blocked my bingo.  A couple of turns later I looked at this and realized he'd snuck one past me.  Against my rack of EIJNTS?, he's 72% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIJNST 9B INJEcTS +73 239
#note A short sim says this play is roughly 27% to win.  From here on, as you'll see, the tile gods give me zero chance.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AIO D9 .IAO +22 274

#note Better at 8A for 34, but given his next rack, it wouldn't have mattered.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?GINQRU B7 QU.RtING +88 362
#note Or QUIRKING.  Either one wins 97.5%.
>Jim_Burlant: BEOORTT N1 OBE +25 297
#note My best scoring option, but the best plays are apparently T(R)O(K)E and 10I RIOT. Not that it really matters - nothing wins even 1%.

>Jim_Burlant: AGNNOST 15K TONGS +27 347
#note Obviously, the long pole in the tent was the INKJETS/FATTIE sequence. Certainly losing my turn AND letting him get away with FATTIE gift-wrapped him the game.   And even if I still lose the turn with INKJETS* but have the presence of mind to challenge FATTIE*, it's a potentially different game. Even with perfect play on my end, this was definitely winnable but hardly a sure win;  it was still close enough that it was a tossup as to who could win.  Even if I made the right plays, the late tiles after INJECTS may still have completely collapsed.  And, given how much of this day went, I wouldn't be surprised if it would have panned out that way.
