>cesar: ADGIOSV 8G VIG +14 14
#note (-3) AVOID, which i saw, and didn't like as much. i know AO isn't a good leave, but i feel AVOID gives up a lot more points than VIG. maybe it scores too much more.
>trip_p: Q H7 Q. +11 11
>cesar: ADEORSX G8 .OX +14 28
#note SOX likely makes more sense after QI, but with such a strong leave i'm still drawn to VOX. (-2)

#note this is ridiculous. i was 100% sure this was good, and was happy when he held it and challenged! (-37)

#note i had a feeling DOC B12 was best, but i'm not fond of doing that after trip's last few plays. RHODIC is kind of cool, but no. (-9.5)

#note i am pretty aware a lot of the time when a play will not sim well, but, i still like toric. the better simmers are 12L ETIC, which seems ridiculous to me, 4A CRETIN, which also seems ridiculous, and K10 EH, which also seems ridiculous. i like trying to keep control of the board. after TORIC we can just play a closed game.

#note 2L HOE is better, yeah, but ONE 4L sims best. again, i didn't want to have to race to the S or anything volatile like that... (-4)

#note i didn't like TAGGED after the last move. i suppose i thought that if he bingoed after GAUD i'd still survive, but now that i think of it, that doesn't seem likely. the only real bingo spot is from the F and that scores too much unless he gets stuck with the J. (-13)
