>Matt_Canik: ?AEKOOY 8E OAKY +22 22
#note This doesn't give up a cheap B or M play. the TOKAY or KAYOS hooks both scare me a little, hence me electing to play OAKY.

#note Can't talk myself 100% into rE(L)OOkED. OkE(Y)DOkE and bOOgE(Y)ED are both two more. Never would have thought to make both blanks Ks.

#note Sims slightly below PODIA N2.

>Matt_Canik: ADEIRUY N1 YAUD +23 219
#note Completely whiffed MERC-MERCY. N12 YAUD sims 3% higher than any other option. I don't like how this yields easy points for her, but I want to shed this YU. Quackle also suggests REDIA or UREDIA N2/N1. 
>Becky_Dyer: AA O1 AA +23 247
>Matt_Canik: EFHIIRR 13E RIF +25 244
#note AA means she didn't have the X last turn. Only drawing two tiles of 32, I highly doubt she hits back with PIX. 
>Becky_Dyer: ELLNOP 14A POLLEN +30 277
>Matt_Canik: EEGHIRV 15F GIVER +34 278
#note Pivotal play here. The 5 outstanding options to me are EH 15A, GIVE 15F, GIVER 15F, GRIEVE 15F, or HIVE/MERCH N12. With all the As, Es, Ss, and Ts in the bag, there's a great shot she hits 15F if I don't play there. HIVE/MERCH is just too volatile for this situation. I figure I have to hit 15F. 

Then comes the dilemma of 'what should I play there?' Looking at the pool, I was 6 vowels and 17 consonants. As such, I want to keep the highest V:C ratio I can. So I chose GIVER. 6000 iterations of a many ply sim agrees with me here, putting GIVER 2% over GIVE, 4.5% over EH, 7% over GRIEVE, and 13% over HIVE. 
>Becky_Dyer: AENRSV 14I RAVENS +28 305
#note After this play, she overdraws. I turn over TTN and throw back N. 
>Matt_Canik: ABEHIRX 15A AX +48 326
#note Given the unseen pool, she can't block HAIR/HEIR 15L next turn without scoring next to nothing or throwing away one of the two remaining vowels, so I play here first, saving that for later.
