>Noah: ADIINOU F4 NUDI. +30 92
#note This seemed to neutralize most good scoring spots, though I guess column D is reasonable. The poins of NUDIE seemed worth it compared to AUDIO D1, and I wasn't a huge fan of AUDIO 14B. Another optionis UNAI C11. I still like this because of its score, but maybe I'm overestimating the strength of AIO.

>Noah: ?AADFIT 11F AFT +19 133
#note No FIAT, TAFIA or ADMIT because they give away cheap scoring spots.
>Betty_Cornelison: HPU 2B HU.P +22 85
>Noah: ?ADFINY 1A FAN +25 158
#note Unfortunately, I wasn't sure enough of HUMPY to play it. AY is clearly best.
>Betty_Cornelison: AELRRTT H1 RATTLER. +77 162
>Noah: ?ADEEIY 15F EYED +27 185
#note AY is still the clear best play.
>Betty_Cornelison: AJR 14H RAJ +31 193
>Noah: ?ACEINW 5H .ACEWINg +74 259
#note Something like CAW, AW or AWL is worth considering, but it seemed better to just clear the rack.
>Betty_Cornelison: ?CENORW 1G C.OWNERs +63 256
>Noah: AAENQTZ 13G QAT +31 290
#note Yikes. I didn't think of the RAJA hook this game. QANAT might be better. On the other hand, I'm partial to not giving up such an easy spot, so this might be the best play anyway.
>Betty_Cornelison: AELV O5 .AVEL +21 277
>Noah: ABEENNZ 4K NABE +30 320
#note Lots of interesting options here, one of which I missed. I thought of NABE, BA(I)ZE, AZ(I)NE, ZE(I)N and BENZ(I)N. BENZIN sets up the case A, but that is far too weak for this position. BAIZE and AZINE open another good bingo lane and don't keep much to excite on the rack. This sets up OBI, but that's not really too bad, because it probably won't win her the game if she gets it, and it'd come in handy for me if I get a bingo. Yet BENZAL is worth some strong consideration. I like scoring and keeping the Z and setting up OBI above, personally, but BENZAL's defensive aspects are certainly desirable.
>Betty_Cornelison: GI 4B GI. +4 281
>Noah: BEINRSZ 10K BIZES +26 346
#note My other idea was to play BEZIL 9K, which Championship Player says is best by about a percentage point compared to this. I could get a really bad draw and lose because Betty gets high-scoring plays, so maybe BEZIL presents those rare situations, even though it allows LEGGIEST, which is rare. Not sure, but this isn't too shabby.
