>Evans_Clinchy: DEEILOO -EOO +0 0
#note The exchange seemed pretty standard to me, but it actually sims a solid 6 points behind just playing through it with DOOLIE. The DEIL leave is weaker than I gave it credit for.
>John_O'Laughlin: IIILNQU -IIL +0 0

>John_O'Laughlin: CINPQUW E6 QU.NIC +34 34
>Evans_Clinchy: BDGJORY J6 JO.Y +30 100
#note Ooh, failed to notice that BOGY/BOYG# at 7I sets up the J nicely. That sims a couple points ahead of my play.

>John_O'Laughlin: AAMNPRR O4 .RAMP +30 108
>Evans_Clinchy: EFIMNSV M3 V.M +16 200
#note FIVE in the same spot sims best. The pool is loaded with A's, E's and blanks, so the IMNS leave works well.

#note Oops, TAHA# F12. I knew there was something longer I was missing.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?ELSUUX H11 EX +36 308
>Evans_Clinchy: AAGITTT H6 TA. +13 370
#note Ridiculous. I was just trying to balance the rack a little bit and somewhat obstruct plays through that B. Turns out this is a pretty terrible play, since I can block bingos with AGITA/TAIGA/GAITA# 3D or TAI# F4. But it ends up blocking his only bingo! SUBEQUAL would have fit in line 6. So lucky.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?AELSUU 6E .UA. +15 323

>John_O'Laughlin: ?EELRSU H1 SLE. +18 341
>Evans_Clinchy: ACGIITT 2F GI.T +9 418
#note This is where I blew it. All I have to do is find a word that blocks bingos in both directions, and I win this game easily. The pool is really scary now, so it's urgent to shut things down this turn. Can't blame myself too much for not knowing TIGLIC#, but ITALIC is a very bad miss that cost me the game.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?ELRSTU 1H .aLUTERS +75 416
>Evans_Clinchy: AACIINT 3C INCIT. +24 442
#note I don't think leaving a tile in the bag is an option -- I need to score as much as possible while digging for the F and/or W to score in the endgame. I liked INCITE both for the points and the board control of it... any counterplay he'll have will be too risky, since it'll open the triple for me. Many-ply sim agrees with INCITE, while the CP solver suggests ACINI, also a solid option.
>John_O'Laughlin: DEEIORR N10 DOREE +42 458
#note Only win. Nicely done.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAFIOSW D3 .AWS +28 470
#note This isn't a word, but meh+, whatever.
