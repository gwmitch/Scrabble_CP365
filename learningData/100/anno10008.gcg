>Jason: AEIJNOY 8H ENJOY +38 38
>Jeff_Fiszbein: OOX 9J OXO +33 33
>Jason: AAIMNRU 7G AMU +14 52
#note Missing AN(OX)IA, which sets up the M nicely. I was focused on keeping IN for ENJOYING. Sim calls it about a 10-point error.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GLLUY 10F GULLY +42 75

#note (Jeff showed me what he was exchanging.)
>Jason: AENNRST M2 TANNERS +82 275
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DGI 10L DIG +16 160
>Jason: AELRTVW N1 VAW +27 302
#note So far so good. Except for ANOXIA, I've been in lockstep with Speedy and the lead's 142. What could go wrong?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEILORT A4 IDOL.TER +60 220
#note Missing DOLERITE, I assume. But his mistake will work out handsomely.
>Jason: EEHILRT N5 EH +28 330
#note Instead of HOTELIER, I make a bad decision. EITHER or LITHER are way better for my situation. Somehow missed both over the board, thought of LITHER in the post-mortem.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ETW B4 TEW +32 252
>Jason: EIIILRT -IIL +0 330
#note Thus begins the "I don't know what the heck to do" portion of the game. Sim likes (F)ILET, which I considered. The S's are so key at this point I need to dig as deep as possible, but I hated scoring 18 and leaving IIR. (shrug)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EENV L1 NEVE +32 284
>Jason: AAEIIRT 1G RETAI. +18 348
#note Last five tiles drawn: IIAAI. Remember Jeff's AAIIV exchange? Sim agrees with this one; makes me happy.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EGHPSU O7 PUGS +27 311
#note Jeff's actual rack.
>Jason: ABIILTU 2H LIB +25 373
#note (A)BULIA! Sims neck-and-neck with LIB in equity, a little behind in win %. But I kind of prefer it to this, actually.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?DEHIRZ G6 Z. +11 322
#note (Jeff's actual rack.)
>Jason: AIMORTU 14F MOIRA +28 401
#note I wished I could calculate all 72 endgame possibilities like Quackle does. Duck says this wins 20/72, while (D)O at G13 wins 42/72 (and 50% of the time here with the bag DS). If Jeff had drawn the D here I make him find ElDRICH to win, and I'm not sure he knows that one.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?CEHIRS 3C RICHESt +79 401
#note That one hurt.
>Jeff_Fiszbein:  (DSTU) +10 411
