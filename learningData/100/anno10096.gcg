#note It seems like at every one day, I have one game where my brain just checks out. And I had a feeling that I was making the wrong opening play. Yuck. Uh, CORODY? This is about 8 back.

#note If I'm going to fish, why not open another lane, rather than partially obscure the main one? (R)EC seems OK.

#note Debated (I)RENICS, but I was feeling greedy...perhaps I should've gone with TA at 10J. At least I'd be fishing with a bingo lane, lol.

#note So Quackle of course calls for U(M), but I felt like stuff was getting out of hand. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do during these last 4 turns. And it shows in my winning percentage, which is at about 37% now, from

>dacrON: AAABLUU 12A BA.ULA +26 329
#note So I briefly debated between BA(C)ULA and AU(C)UBA, but I decided the points were worth it, with the bag being somewhat even on C/V. Quackle says I'm wrong, and AU(C)UBA is 4 better

#note This seemed as good an option as any. Maybe I could hit a big J play? Quackle says I am [deservedly] screwed.
>Peter_Armstrong: HIIJOQT 12H JO +36 425
#note And I catch a huge break here, as Peter didn't think of GROSSEST.
>dacrON: ADEITT M10 DIET +26 399
#note So I track like three times and think he has DHIIQ. I then figure out the winning endgame sequence, but think he has Q(A)DI for 50. So I just play the endgame hoping he will miss Q(A)DI. Note that he doesn't have a D. lol.
