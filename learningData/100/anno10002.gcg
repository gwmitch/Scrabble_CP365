>Joe_Miller: ACEHILS 8D CHIAS +26 26
#note Joe said he thought about LAICHES, but wasn't sure. It is a phony word. Also, I had BEFMNOQ on my opening rack and exchanged BFOQ but forgot to add it at the start.
>Noah: EEMNOTV I8 MOVE +23 23
#note Seemed to open up more than the other placements of MOVE. It's also more exclusive, since the other MOVE is conducive to shorter words by him, while this is more conducive to longer words and also gives two CHIASM hooks which he probably doesn't know.
>Joe_Miller: ELOOPT E7 P.OTO +20 46
#note He must have missed POTHOLE.
>Noah: EIJMNTT D11 JET +29 52
>Joe_Miller: DELNO H11 OLDEN +23 69
>Noah: GGIMNRT C12 MIGG +24 76
#note Some misses here. I saw GRIM J6 later, but not right away. Also, I missed the (PHOTO)G hook, and MEG is probably a better play than this. 
>Joe_Miller: ?AILOOR H1 wOORALI. +74 143
>Noah: AINNRTT 12C ..NTA. +19 95
#note I think I prefer this to TAN J8. PHOTON is interesting, but this seems good. Actually, I thought ANTIPHOTON was good but forgot about it on this turn. Turns out it's ANTIPROTON that's good.
>Joe_Miller: AIY 15A YA.I +27 170
>Noah: GIILNRT 14G R.TILING +72 167
#note I've gotten away with TIRINGLY before, and thought I might be able to now. But it was club, so I didn't.
