#note i am aware of puttying, but the OX setup is just too much to pass up.

#note very lame, i apparently didn't write down this rack. gah!

#note rowed is too ugly. yes. but crackle likes it. (-1)
>bruce_d: EORV H11 .OVER +27 46
>cesar: DEEGIKT 10F KEG +28 85
#note this is ridiculous. i immediately laid it down (it's the best play if grover's a word) and then i thought 'oh crap that's probably not good' as i am making the motion to hit the clock. luckily, it stayed.
>bruce_d: GIN 8H .....ING +42 88
>cesar: DEILNPT 12G P.D +9 94
#note no; DEINT is a better leave. i misvalued this. PLY (-4)

#note N10 ANIMI is a pretty cool guy. eh makes five overlaps and doesn't afraid of anything.

>cesar: ABDGIIM 14J GAMBI. +30 264
#note eek. well, better keep scoring. i will seriously give you a dollar the next time we meet if you can find the best play here. (-24)

>cesar: DEEHIOW 14B WHO +37 301
#note i TOTALLY chickened out on WHEE. i should probably review the 4s at some point. HOWDIE seems best but it slightly scares me. (-5.5)
>bruce_d: ?AILNST E6 NAILSeT +71 284
#note antislip!
>cesar: DEEIJOU M12 JU.E +26 327
#note JOINED is a better move for various reasons that i understand and some i probably don't understand. it seems to paradoxically devolatilize the board (and my leave) a little bit, plus it scores more. plus, the Q. (-7.5)
>bruce_d: DEW 13A DEW +38 322
>cesar: CDEILOS A8 COILE. +30 357
#note if i was playing for spread, i would go for M7 ZINC or 10M COL. i was too scared of a disaster. (-13)

>cesar: AADDNSS N6 DA. +19 376
#note ok now as long as i don't draw the Q i should be ok.
>bruce_d: O 8D O. +3 343
#note cool play

#note maybe i misannotated this and the QAT spot wasn't there. i refuse to believe we could have both missed it

>cesar: NQ 6J ..N +6 447
#note to be frank, i was super nervous this whole game. bruce killed me the first time we played and i was convinced i was gonna lose a game on the final day to get out of cash contention. maybe this is a good lesson!
