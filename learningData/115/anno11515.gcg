>Matthew_Levine: AEGU 8H AGUE +10 10
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACDKNS L8 SNACKeD +85 85
#note There's only 1 eight in this rack - UNCASKED.
>Matthew_Levine: AENW M12 ANEW +25 35
>Matthew_Larocque: CJLSTTU N10 JUT +33 118
>Matthew_Levine: AGO O8 AGO +21 56
>Matthew_Larocque: ACLOSTV 14J CA..T +28 146
#note Tight sim results, although this ranks pretty far down. Fishing with (DE)V actually takes the cake here. O12 AVOS for 33 and K4 CLOV(E) for 20 are the runner-ups. Seems like dumping the V here is important....
>Matthew_Levine: ?EEIORS 11E ESOtERI. +86 142
#note His best play by far, all the other bingos score 60 or 59.
>Matthew_Larocque: DLLORSV 12A DROLL +18 164
#note Still pretty clustered sim results. Q still wants me to shed the V. This ranks way down.
>Matthew_Levine: IQ 9G QI +23 165
>Matthew_Larocque: FINNRSV B10 FI.NS +32 196
#note Nothing else scores this good.
>Matthew_Levine: OW 15M .OW +29 194
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEINRV A8 EVE +23 219
#note Again nothing decisive is coming out of the sim. Playing longer with NIEVE or REIVE sims only a hair better.
>Matthew_Levine: ADIM 13D AMID +16 210
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINOOR A14 OI +8 227
#note H13 OI sims good as well, but I don't even have an L....
>Matthew_Levine: ABHT K4 BATH. +20 230
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIINOR 4H ORI.I +16 243
#note Sim suggests just playing OI again, at L4 this time.
>Matthew_Levine: BDIR 5E BIRD +17 247
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILNOY 6B OILY +16 259
#note This doesn't even show up on generate choices. It sims pretty horrid too. I never even noticed the (t)EENY spot. I didn't know YEELIN. Fishing off YE or YO sims better too. My play only gives a 40% win vs 59% for (t)EENY.
>Matthew_Levine: ENVY 3E ENVY +21 268
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEEGNT C3 TEE.NG +16 275
#note This sims best, if only to show how crappy my options are now.
>Matthew_Levine: PRX 4A PR.X +32 300
#note I'm going to need a big play to catch up now...
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEMRUZ J2 MA.ZE +39 314
#note Like that. Though H13 EMU beats this play in the SIM. I'd be hard pressed to turn down 39 points when I need them this badly.
>Matthew_Levine: AFL A1 FLA. +27 327
>Matthew_Larocque: EHORSTU I6 HU.S +29 343
#note The blank T still haunting me. (t)HOSE or (t)HOUS for 41.
>Matthew_Levine: ENPTU N4 UPENT +11 338
>Matthew_Levine: ENPTU --  -11 327
#note He couldn't go out, so I guess he just tried this out of desperation.
>Matthew_Larocque: EORT 3L TORE +10 353
#note (M)ETRO.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ENPTU) +14 367
#note Missed a lot of plays here and still eked out another win. Matt seems like a pretty good sport though.
