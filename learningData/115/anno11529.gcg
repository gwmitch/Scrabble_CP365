#note BEEN C12 or something like that, probably. this is kind of a "i don't really know what to do other than go for the blanks / end the game quickly / keep scoring" type of move. (-4)

#note VIE B1 sims best. goddamn i have no idea what to do here either. i can't be worrying too much about defense even after SUQ because i am down and i hae the blank. VIE doesn't seem right. neither does VIDEO. what's the right play? (-8)
