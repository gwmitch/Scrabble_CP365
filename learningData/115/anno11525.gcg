>Matthew_Larocque: CEIISST 8G CIS +10 10
#note What a strange rack. I struggled for a long time here. CIS/SIC, CITIES/ICIEST are pretty close. Exchange I is in the mix as well.
>Matthew_Levine: ADEHY 9I HEADY +29 29
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIIST G7 I.E +7 17
#note Haha. Throwing back the letters I just drew, EII, seems better than this meh play. Obviously I forgot about TEIID.
>Matthew_Levine: ADEKLST 6D STALKED +74 103
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIPSTZ D3 ZIP. +30 47
#note Pretty neck and neck with (S)IZIEST for 52 and ZI(T) for 24. P isn't a bad letter to keep, but is it worth dropping 6 points? I'm pretty far behind so I think I need to hang onto the S.
>Matthew_Levine: IX 10J XI +52 155
#note Well this should be tough to win now.
>Matthew_Larocque: EINNSTY 5I YIN +20 67
#note I'm already down to ~12% chance to win the game. YEN just might be better because of how many Es remain. I think I missed NI(T)TY and NE(T)TY for 26.
>Matthew_Levine: ABH 8M BAH +31 186
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGNST 4H NEGATES +81 148
#note No matter how many times I play NEGATES, it never seems to jump out like a bingo I should see instantly. So I wasted time here but eventually got over my "duh" moment. This upgrades me to 22%.
>Matthew_Levine: EOO 3B OO.E +26 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANNQTV 7L QAT +24 172
#note Don't have time to waste hoarding the Q around. ~26%
>Matthew_Levine: MM 2B MM +24 236
#note As soon as he played this, I had my eyes peeled for the UB combo.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LNNORV 4B LO.N +16 188
#note Didn't know what to do....I had to play something eventually. This could ruin the BOOZE spot, but that seemed like a longshot anyways. V(AI)N looks like the play I needed. ~23%
>Matthew_Levine: EGO 10M EGO +17 253
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FLNRRV M3 R.V +12 200
#note Well, with that terrible draw, I'm going to need some ridiculous fluke to pull this one out. ~21%
>Matthew_Levine: EENPRTU 2E PRETUNE +68 321
>Matthew_Levine: EENPRTU --  -68 253
#note Sorry Matt. I couldn't let you do that. Not with....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?FLNORR 2E FORLoRN +69 269
#note This on my rack. Well, actually I could have. But then I would have probably lost. Still the underdog as it is.... ~48%
>Matthew_Levine: EENPRTU 1F TEEN +23 276
#note I'm assuming he knows ELOIN, he must have just forgot about the spot. Or missed ERUPT in his rack.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFGIOW F9 WIG +14 283
#note Doesn't even make the generate choices list. But it fares decently in the simulation. (T)OWAGE ranks highest and it's 40%.
>Matthew_Levine: ACJPRU E10 PAC +24 300
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEFORS 13B FORESAy +78 361
#note I'm awful. Seriously. I could have played any number of valid words here, including making the blank a W. Interestingly, 1K AFORE outsims all the bingos. Either way, that blank + S draw just tipped the odds way in my favour. *OUTSIMS = MISSOUT, SUMOIST.
>Matthew_Levine: EJORU N1 JOE. +24 324
#note Somebody has the last O.
>Matthew_Larocque: AILRUUV O10 .VULAR +30 391
#note (EX)UVIA is a sneaky little play to setup my L. I still want that B, so playing 5 letters helps my odds.
>Matthew_Levine: ORUW O1 OW +47 371
#note OW indeed.
>Matthew_Larocque: BDIINTU A1 DUB +41 432
#note 97.5% with this play - almost seals the deal.
>Matthew_Levine: ADIRTUU 12H AUDIT +16 387
#note B9 ADRI(F)T, 14J DATUR(A). I'll admit I had no idea DATURA was a word either.
>Matthew_Larocque: IINT 12A TIN +11 443
#note No outs.
>Matthew_Levine: RU A10 RU. +3 390
#note BOOZER is better than going out. Heck, I wasn't even sure on that either.
>Matthew_Levine:  (EI) +4 394
#note I really shouldn't have won this. Matt said he didn't challenge FORESAy just because I could have easily played FORESAw. Yes, that does seem logical doesn't it. Too bad I don't play using logic!
