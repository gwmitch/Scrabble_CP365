>Ross_Brown: CEEOOSU 9C COOEES +19 31
#note Wayne is obviously fishing, so I try to make the bingo harder.
>Wayne_Barclay: AEILLRT 5B LITERAL +72 74
>Ross_Brown: DEGJRSU F8 R.JUDGES +85 116
#note Wayne almost challenges.

>Ross_Brown: ?CDDEEU 12D DE.UCtED +80 196
>Wayne_Barclay: AIMW 11J WAMI +29 136
#note I'm pretty sure that's not a valid plural of WAMUS, but just in case, holding heavy tiles, I decide to use the I instead of challenging.
>Ross_Brown: BGTUVXY M10 T.VY +20 216
#note Quackle prefers 10K TUX +27.

>Wayne_Barclay: EL A1 LE. +36 242
#note Wayne manages to squeeze 83 points out of that Z.
>Ross_Brown: AGLNOST 13C GON. +17 285
#note I did this for the leave, holding the case L for (OI)L. Quackle agrees.
>Wayne_Barclay: MOY 10I YOM +24 266
>Ross_Brown: AFLSTTU J3 FAULT +15 300
#note This is getting close; time to make a bid for the second blank.

>Wayne_Barclay: F B14 F. +10 294
>Ross_Brown: BEINNPV 11E B.N +22 361
#note Perhaps I should be blocking with a long word here, like VENIN, but this puts me far enough ahead that I might survive a bingo, and besides, I don't want to draw the Q.
>Wayne_Barclay: ?ADEINN 1A .ANDmINE +80 374
#note Again, I'm pretty sure "land mine" is two words, but he forwent (L)ANDlINE (and (L)INDANEs and INlANDE(R)), so maybe he knows this is good and is angling for a challenge.  Knowing he will draw the Q, with only a few spots for it, all I need is a good out-in-two to win.
>Ross_Brown: AEINOPV 2K AEON +14 375
#note Faced with 15H (S)PIV for the out, Wayne now has a choice of playing Q(A)T (two places) to save spread or blocking (S)PIV and allowing L1 P(ER)V +24.  Neither choice wins for him.
#note By the way, Quackle finds a fabulous alternative play in the same area; can you find it?
>Wayne_Barclay: GIOQRT G4 Q.T +16 390
#note Actually, Wayne didn't see (S)PIV coming; he might have done better to block it.
