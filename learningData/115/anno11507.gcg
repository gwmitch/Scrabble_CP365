#note Two spots for FEH -- M12 and K10. The former opens the (OF)T hook, which I'm likely to cash in since there aren't many T's left. The latter leaves the bingo possibility in line 14. Close call; sim prefers the former by about 1 point.

#note This appears to be best. There are ways to score way more here (like SEXT 14D for 39), but this board is open enough that chasing a bingo makes sense. Sim agrees.

#note Quackle thinks it's time to get desperate and swing things wide open. EOSINE 14J! Crazy, right? Do humans actually play like this? Is this what Nigel would do? Questions like this keep me up at night.

#note UNTIE may well be better. It's 3 extra points, and the E is easier to bingo through than the I, and it's also not a bad idea to dump an extra consonant, since the pool is so consonant-heavy anyway.
