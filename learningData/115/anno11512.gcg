>Paul_Holser: DEIKT 8D KITED +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: ADENNRX 9F AXED +44 44
#note Icky leave, but the only play that preserves a vowel is 9F AX, which scores 36 -  a few too many points to give up relative to this play's 44.  This is best.
>Paul_Holser: BBOO 10C BOOB +25 55
>Jim_Burlant: CILNNRY 11B LINY +30 74
#note This is a very strong play, but it's not best.  Quackle's #1 choice is the very slick (I)R(O)NY E8, which scores 29 and, more importantly, preserves my only vowel. IRONY wins 51.9%; this wins 50.9.  (-2.6)
>Paul_Holser: EEEEEEE -?? +0 55
>Jim_Burlant: CEJNPRR G6 PR.. +14 88
#note Paul actually exchanged 3 on his last turn - for some reason, Quackle kept putting an extra blank in the unseen pool which I had to edit out.  Strange.  Anyway - I considered this, KRONE (didn't know the R and N back hooks to KRONE) and exchanging.  I figured this would leave me a J dump away from bingoing while he would hopefully break up his rack. Quackle agrees with me, as it likes this or KRONER/KRONEN equally well.    After all - how likely is he to need the P?
>Paul_Holser: EIOQRSU 6G .IROQUES +73 128
#note If you needed one play to epitomize the kind of night I was having, this was it.  I hang a P - a P! - and it gives him the only bingo in his rack.  The sim is conflicted as to whether this or H1 RISQUE 79 is Paul's best play, as it's still toggling back/forth between the two choices at over 1000 iterations.  He's 62% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: CEIJLNR L4 JE. +20 108
#note Too caught up in the mindset of J-dump/bingo that I'd used to convince myself to put down PREX.  H8 DECLINER scores 36 and L3 INJURE scores 28.  Q likes 12A JIN - I don't.  Play for 25, give back at least 33 when I'm 40 points down?  No thanks.  That said, DECLINER or INJURE should have been the plays.  This is weak.
>Paul_Holser: ILNO 12A LINO +23 151
>Jim_Burlant: CIILNRT D4 CLIN. +22 130
#note The only 8 in this rack is NITROLIC, and it doesn't play.  This is best.
>Paul_Holser: FLU 5B FU.L +14 165
>Jim_Burlant: FIMRTTW B2 MIF. +24 154
#note I got paranoid about his coming back with sometihing like TURFY B2 38, so I wanted to take that out.  Best is apparently N2 TWITS and/or M5 FEW.   This wins roughly 2-1/2% less often and sims 4-1/2 points down on TWITS.  Certainly I should be able to land some vowels, right?
>Paul_Holser: O 4L .O +9 174
>Jim_Burlant: GHRTTTW M2 WH. +18 172
#note These kind of racks often give me trouble - I never know whether to unload all the counters or worry more about the one-pointers.  Best is apparently WROTE or TOTER M3.  This outscores everything but M2 WHORE.  WROTE should have been the play.
>Paul_Holser: AET N2 EAT +31 205
>Jim_Burlant: EGRTTTW O1 WET +30 202
#note Was set to play WET A1 when this opened up and I auto-piloted this.  TEW O1 scores 33 and should have been the play.  25% to win.
>Paul_Holser: DR 3A R.D +8 213
>Jim_Burlant: EGGRTTU J5 G.UT +5 207
#note No good options yet again.  Q's first 2 choices look idiotic:  I9 DRUGGET and I1 TUGGER.  Both play for peanuts and give Paul a triple line to work with while he's obvously closing in on something.  No thanks.  The third choice is one I considered but didn't think was necessary:  Exchange GGTU.  I thought with IIINNN unseen I'd wind up with IN and be sitting pretting with EGINRT in my rack.  32% to win.
>Paul_Holser: ?DINNPR 10H NoNDRIP +73 286
#note The only bingo for Paul, and he's 87% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIORT C10 ...GO +16 223
#note A very annoying rack - it looks like it should have something, but the only 8 in this is RAVIGOTE, and both V's are still unseen.  I probably should have played for points here with GORE A1, but I had had so much trouble with my last few racks (admittedly self-inflicted) that I was in fishing mode.  GORE wins 8%; this wins 6.
>Paul_Holser: AAV A12 .AVA +21 307
>Jim_Burlant: AEIRRST L8 TA.RIERS +70 293
#note The only bingo, and it's back up to 22% winning chances. 
>Paul_Holser: AEH 15L .HEA +21 328
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIVYZ 8L .IVY +30 323
#note Q ilkes F2 CAVY 29, but this is a respectable second.  CAVY wins 36%, this wins 27 and threatens CZAR on row 15 - IZAR may still allow him easy plays on row 15, which CZAR will signficantly reduce.
>Paul_Holser: EO A2 O.E +14 342
#note Smart play by Paul, blocking a possible ZORI/ZERO at A1.
>Jim_Burlant: AACETUZ 14I CZA. +35 358
#note I was nervous about his bingoing on row 12,  and the problems with ZEE 13K (Championship Player's choice) are that it didn't block a bingo like SOMEoNE 15C, and that it gave up 11 points on the scoreboard to this - critical given my deficit.  I felt I had no choice but to roll the dice and hope he couldn't bingo on row 12.  This wound up winning me the game.
