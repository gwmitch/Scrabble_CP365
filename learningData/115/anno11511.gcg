>Matthew_Larocque: EIINRTV 8B INVITER +78 78
#note This took a lot longer to find than it should have. VITRINE can also be played.
>Matthew_Levine: EGP 7G PEG +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFNTTU F8 .UFT +15 93
#note I saw UNFETT(ER) and I chickened out, thinking maybe UNFETTERED was an adjective. I was so disappointed in myself. It's the best play by far. While I'm at it I should remember ENFETTER.
>Matthew_Levine: DIS I5 DI.S +17 37
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILNT 5B ENTAILE. +68 161
>Matthew_Levine: ?NORSSW 12C WORSeNS +78 115
#note His only bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEILOZ 4A ZOEA +54 215
#note Sim says add the L for 58 points. Not a huge difference though.
>Matthew_Levine: OVX 13B VOX +45 160
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIILPQ 7B QI +26 241
>Matthew_Levine: EHM 3C HEM +31 191
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILLPW 2B AWL +26 267
#note Ok, this was a shameless and stupid play. I don't know how well Matt knows his fours, but somehow I thought I could sneak this past him. I didn't play PAWL, because I was trying to set up PLEAT next turn.
>Matthew_Levine: OY 14C OY +24 215
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHILPT 1D PILED +43 310
#note I chickened out on PITHED, and of course it's just fine. He probably would have left it anyways.
>Matthew_Levine: CNOU 11I UNCO +14 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DFHTTU 12L HUT +22 332
#note Ok, so this part of the game was kind of complicated. I wanted to hang onto the F to make a F(OXY) play. I also had a D to make (WOO)D. I was hoping to cash these in, so I made this play to kind of distract him. With the blank, the blatant set-up could benefit me too, so that's why I ended up playing HUT.
>Matthew_Levine: AKR H1 .RAK. +15 244
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABDFST 11D FA. +33 365
#note And sure enough, BeDFAST plays. I still don't even remember what that means, and I know I looked it up. At this point any of the juicy plays I have are 99.9% to win - I just took the 33 points since it scored best (aside from that bingo).
>Matthew_Levine: AJ 2H .AJ +26 270
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDGIST 15A BID +26 391
#note This time there's no bingo. GID has slightly high valuation but I don't think it's relevant.
>Matthew_Levine: CEI H12 .ICE +18 288
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGOST O6 pOTAGES +82 473
#note Any of 10 bingos or so score 82 - just play bingo roulette here. This seemed to be among the better defensive options.
>Matthew_Levine: BTU N7 BUT +13 301
>Matthew_Larocque: DEINRY 14H .INDERY +30 503
#note I guess I negelcted to write down my 7th letter.
>Matthew_Levine: AEMNORR K1 MARRONE +79 380
>Matthew_Levine: AEMNORR --  -79 301
#note A last ditch attempt. MARRON, AMARONE.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLO K2 ALOE +19 522
#note I should have blocked his next play, I just stared at RAJA the whole time.
>Matthew_Levine: AEMNORR 15L MEAN +41 342
