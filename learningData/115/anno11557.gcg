>Winter: ?ADFUUY 10L FAYs +27 442
#note Once I saw I was in the bag, my heat sunk, and I pinned my hopes on his having the L.
>Dominick_Mancine: EEINRSV 13E ENVIERS +68 448
#note But he didn't, and I totally deserved that loss. Complained for two days about how I couldn't get the tiles against the strong players, and when I finally did... SUPERMEGASUCK!!!
