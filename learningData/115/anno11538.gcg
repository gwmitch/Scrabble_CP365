#note Quackle prefers MEDIA, for some reason. My defensive instincts disagree.
>Wayne_Barclay: ANNU 11B ANNU. +10 134
>Ross_Brown: ?ADEEKR 11H KADEERs +90 344
#note I was positive this was good.  Seems to have been a cross-pollination of KILLDEER (bird) with Arabic surnames in my memory banks.
#note Of course, 11H KnEADER +90 (or C6 dARKE(N)ED +86) is the correct play.

#note Can you find the (two points) better bingo?  I wanted to fill this slot, and was happy just to see the D land in the optimal spot.

#note I probably wouldn't have tried this wild guess if the V and P hadn't landed on TLSs.  It could be a verb or an adjective, but its common usage in technical circles on the Internet is as a noun, meaning goggles that are worn over glasses (246,000 hits on Google with this spelling).  Maybe some day.

#note Wow, what a pile of junk, given what's unseen.  BUPPY doesn't play.  The safe play is B7 Y(O) +5 to block, but I couldn't resist the attraction of scoring 24 and leaving UPPY so that I could start the endgame with 4K P(REX) +13 and follow up with O4 YUP +33 or force Wayne to block same.
#note Quackle says that B7 Y(O) +5 loses 10 points of valuation on top of the 19 points of spread, but then, Quackle doesn't know that Wayne just fished off one tile, and besides, the block play leaves Row 4 wide open.
>Wayne_Barclay: AEGILNN A1 GLEANIN. +83 378
#note Some justice for Wayne in this game, at last, and a huge swing in the spread as a result.
