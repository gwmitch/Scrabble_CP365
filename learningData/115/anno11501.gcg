#note Yeah, OPIATE in the same spot. Didn't think of it for some reason.

#note Quackle likes BY C9 22. The board isn't that friendly to a bingo-ish leave now, but Q is likely to play at D1 and open a triple lane, so that might be part of it. 6B BAGGY is 7 less than BREY but keeps ERT, which might be enough better than AGT to justify forgoing the points. Seems to me like BREY# controls the board a little more, but it's early yet.

#note Yeah, weird play, I know. And probably not worth it at this score and point in the game. I know what I was thinking, though in hindsight I was overemphasizing it here - Quackle doesn't do as well on closed boards, and if Q takes a couple of turns to build a bingo, I might be able to shut things down even further. 
>Quackle: ABDDEOP 15A ABODED +40 174
>Geoff: DEEEFGO N10 FODGE. +38 228
#note What did I say about closing the board down? Never mind...too many points to pass up here, even though I could get hit back hard.
>Quackle: LNNPSTV -LNNPV +0 174
>Geoff: EEMNUUX 9I XU +35 263
#note A little better than XU is the sweet overlap EXEUNT at O10.
>Quackle: ACLNOST J1 COLTANS +76 250
>Geoff: EELMNTU 1J .ULMEN +33 296
#note CEMENT for 6 more keeping LU? Or LUMEN O7 to take out the O column? Quackle agrees with CULMEN. I figured now that the board is open, I'd need all the points I could get while still leaving decently and going for the blank and esses. Will probably still need a bingo to win. (Haven't had one yet...)

#note Thanks!
>Quackle: ?AEJLNR 5I R.J +20 284
#note Half expecting JAVELINA F3 to come back at me here, but nope.
>Geoff: EKOVWWZ O7 WOKE +38 414
#note Easy choice, what else would I do? WOKE is just enough to outrun the response bingos, though I'm going to be stuck with a ton of points.
