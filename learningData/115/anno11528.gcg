>Chris_Canik: EGLNQST -GLQ +0 0
#note Absolutely no reason to try for points with something wasteful like GENTS. 
>Justin_Sheridan: CIILY 8H ICILY +28 28
>Chris_Canik: ENNORST H8 .NTONERS +77 77
#note How lucky of me. Then again, in my club game immediately prior to this game, I exchanged on the first turn and drew into a bingo, just like this... except in that game, I lost by 238.
>Justin_Sheridan: DHU G11 DUH +25 53
>Chris_Canik: AEGINQT J7 Q. +11 88
#note I pull the trigger on the obvious fish too soon - QAT at F10 is 39 points, and a bit better than Q(I), according to Quackle.
>Justin_Sheridan: KRY 11G ..RKY +26 79
>Chris_Canik: AEGILNT 15A GENITAL. +80 168
#note Definitely not the correct bingo - leaving vowels below both the Double Word and Triple Letter isn't smart. TAGLINE(S) is probably smarter, or (S)TEALING, because it's more defensive.
>Justin_Sheridan: EHP 14D PEH +35 114
>Chris_Canik: ?AIJNVW A10 JAWIN. +21 189
#note Not a good play on my part. Things like (K)ANJI or JAI(L) are obvious and better. I just saw IJVW (which happened to be the first four I drew after the bingo) and went tunnel vision on trying to get rid of as many of those as possible.
>Justin_Sheridan: ACD E11 CAD.. +16 130
>Chris_Canik: ?EFIRVX K4 VEXI. +41 230
>Justin_Sheridan: BI 10A .IB +14 144
>Chris_Canik: ?AFFRUU C10 .UFF +24 254
#note FA(QI)R is cool, but not as good. It's not every day that you get to play through QI.
>Justin_Sheridan: AEGNRRS D4 RANGERS +81 225
>Chris_Canik: ?AEEORU 4H OEU.RE +20 274
#note REAROUSE is what I missed. I knew there would be something. AUREOlE very nearly fit right next to RANGERS with 6 overlaps. Why couldn't he have had MANGERS instead?
>Justin_Sheridan: DOP 8A DOP. +21 246
>Chris_Canik: ?AAELTT A1 LAcTATE. +77 351
>Justin_Sheridan: AABEM C1 ABEAM +24 270
>Chris_Canik: ?ILOSTW E4 TWO +33 384
#note I chickened out on (B)LOWIeST for some stupid reason. ABEAM blocked LOWLIEST, which would've been fun.
>Justin_Sheridan: AO J10 O.A +9 279
>Chris_Canik: ?DEILSS N1 DIESeLS +78 462
#note (A)SSoILED is fun.
>Justin_Sheridan: ENOOZ O7 OZONE +44 323
>Chris_Canik: EGMORTU 1H GROUTE. +30 492
#note I stopped myself from being sad about my non-go here because that would've just been greedy.
