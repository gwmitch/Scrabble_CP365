>Sue_Tremblay: ADFHPTT 8G HAFT +20 20
>deen: DEIPRRS H6 DR.PIERS +62 62
#note Best is 9E PRIDE. I really wanted an E for REPRISED or one of its anagrams...took a long time before DRAPIERS#, which both Sue and I seemed to think was a curtain maker...hmm.
>Sue_Tremblay: DEINPRT 13H .PRINTED +78 98
#note 10B INTREPID is positionally safer, but 13 points is a lot. Sue saw both plays and went for points.
>deen: EJNNQRT 11D TENN.R +12 74
#note N9 JENNET best. I word I vaguely recall, but didn't see. My play, which I didn't much like, doesn't even make the list - exch JNQ is near th e top!?
>Sue_Tremblay: AEEFIOO O10 FOO.IE +33 131
#note Best
>deen: AEIJOOQ 12K QI +37 111
#note I saw 12A JIAO, but thought it would allow too many points in return - the J might have some chances at 12N still. 6F QADI probably a better alternative, gets rid of another vowel.
>Sue_Tremblay: AEHSSUZ F4 HAZES +48 179
>deen: AEEJOOO 10B JOE +28 139
#note I prefer Q's 6H DOJO, same points, dumps a 2nd O.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?BISTUW N12 W.B +29 208
#note Again best - five #1 choices in a row!
>deen: AEEMOOY G4 MAE +27 166
#note Right idea, but G5 YEAH is 6 pts more and better leave.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?ISTTUU J6 TU.U +6 214
#note Q wants to burn the S for 16 pts with K4 TUTUS, but Sue's play is still 5th. She predicably joked about usurping Mr. Ulu's U's....
>deen: EEOOORY -EOOOY +0 166
#note This trade is 3rd ranked, 6D OOZED 15, and B10 JOEY 14 (really?) are top two...setting up that S hook looks a bit crazy to me, as well as column A plays...
>Sue_Tremblay: ?ACISTY 12C YA +16 230
#note A small miss here...E10 YEA is better play for these two tiles, for an extra 4 pts. Q likes simply 10B JOEY, keeping the A as a bingo fish.
>deen: AEKLRST B10 .ERKS +38 204
#note With TUTU, the S-hook on SHAFT is no longer available for TALKERS. No STALKER either. Q wants to fish K or KA for best bingo chances - I went for points...5th place.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?BCISTV 7C VIC. +13 243
#note I prefer VIBE to VICE here, same spot...Q wants to play K5 BITS 28 for the extra pts!?
>deen: AEGLOTV N4 VOLTAGE +72 276
#note Finally a break, although I almost missed it - was very close to D4 VOGIE 20, dumping the VG. A bit lucky.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?ABEEST 8L BE.T +27 270
#note Three missed bingoes, but all 9s! I might have seen one: L7 ThEBA(IN)ES 61, but no hope with the others - 4B BEEc(HM)AST 82 (!), and L6 ASBEsT(IN)E...Sue's play is 3rd, with a great leave, and actually a higher rank than the 60-ptr bingoes...lol 
>deen: DDGLMOO H1 GLOM +43 319
#note H1 DOOM is very slightly better in Q's estimation, but I wanted to keep a vowel despite the double D's.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?AAERSU 2H .AUREAtS +68 338
>Sue_Tremblay: ?AAERSU --  -68 270
#note A costly error. LAUREAT* needs the final E.

Best is 2A cAESURAL 68, which I would not have seen. I think I would have found what Sue played next or 2C AUREoLAS 61, but I'd be disappointed to not score more...still a bingo is better than nothing.
>deen: ?ADDIOX D3 IXOD.D +34 353
#note A cute play, and a held one, but the simple I2 OX or AX would have blocked the bingo lanes. I lazily assumed there might be something in any case, so went for tile turnover. Sue eventually accepted.
>Sue_Tremblay: ?AAERSU 1C ASsUA.ER +59 329
>deen: ?AILNNO C1 .NOA +21 374
#note Sue's last blocked K1 LANOLIN, but not sOLANIN, which I unfortunately didn't know! My play comes in 2nd after the missed bingo.
>Sue_Tremblay: ACGILNO 13A O.A +24 353
#note Q prefers to keep one in the bag with C12 YA 22. Sue's play emptied the bag.
>deen: ?EIILNY K5 YIN +16 390
#note Really? A bingo miss thru the B? L3 INEdIBLY 74 collects another 26 off Sue's rack - spread anyone? Gah...and I was happy to engineer a decent out-in-2....lol
>Sue_Tremblay: CGILNUW B4 WIG +24 377
#note 14B SWING or SWUNG are the same net score.
>deen: ?EIL 4K aLI.E +22 412
#note There are many outs, but this is clearly best.
>deen:  (UCLN) +12 424
