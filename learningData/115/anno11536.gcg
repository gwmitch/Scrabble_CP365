#note What are the chances of him having another U?
>Wayne_Barclay: IRTU 1G .UIRT +42 95
#note Actually, he has the fourth and last U.

#note There's a neat nine here, a word you may not know.
>Ross_Brown: BEILSSU N1 BUS +25 145
#note This signals that I hold the case S, forcing Wayne to block (OPeRANT)S.
>Wayne_Barclay: ABEN 8L BEAN +38 234
#note Not a bad block!

#note Nice rack, but I really need to open some bingo lanes.

>Ross_Brown: AEEORSW H11 SWORE +52 248
#note This was going to be 9L EWE +29 until he opened this big score.  I debated playing SWARE instead, but decided to keep the A despite there being four more unseen.  Bad choice…
>Wayne_Barclay: ADEILRX 13F EX.RDIAL +100 392
>Ross_Brown: ADEEENT -  +0 248
#note I could have looked for the bingo and found O8 (N)EATENED +80, but it seemed that the only chance to win the game was to challenge this off; Quackle says I have less than 10% chance even if I bingo.
#note Challenge lost.

#note Wayne blocked my bingo, but left the E hook open.

>Ross_Brown: ?AEENRT B5 REiNTA.E +65 328
#note Wayne blocked 15A vENERAT(E).  What is there across the K?  Not this (nothing that fits, actually), but it's worth a try.  Sounds like REUPTAKE.
