#note I was in a noisy bar at this time, NOT DRINKING, and watching my Scrabble coach on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, so my thinking is not the greatest. Quackle thinks XI 5D 30 is the best.

#note Quackle thinks EX 6M is the best play; I'm not sure why that's better than OX in the same place.

#note This is most likely where I lost the game. I played FATS instead of FAT, and that lack of flexibilty left on my rack killed me. FATS has a win percentage of 35, vs 57 for FAT

#note This is a lost game for me, but I made the right move in this situation by playing JUGA. I wasn't 100 percent sure that it took an A, and I knew he had one, but I didn't see any outplays witht at rack
