#note L7 EXILIC is best. Saw it, but wasn't confident enough in it being good to play it.

#note Sacrificing a couple of points to save the H for a play at H11. Was tempted to play HELP at D12, thought it unwise to open the 3x3 line at this score. Altho it doesn't come atop the computer's choices, PHT at 4K is cute and scores 38.

#note I don't think many of you saw the highest scoring bingo, coming down from 08.

#note I took some time with this play. Wanted to play NAG right away, for leave purposes, but the board really isn't conducive to bingos after that play. I liked GAR because there was only one other A available to take advantage of the front hook. C-player liked 12A RIATA, followed by 4L STAG.

#note Q-phobia kept me from making C-Player's best play here - OIDIA at A10. A sim shows A12 DOAT to be best.
