>Marsh: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 0
>Matt: BEEHLQU H4 QUEE. +24 58
#note I'm often in a hurry to dump the Q, but there's something to be said for 7G HE, keeping BELQU and getting a better score next turn.  This actually benefitted me though, as the game played out.
>Marsh: DEINNOT 9I INTONED +64 64
#note NOONTIDE is 68.
>Matt: ABFHLOT 8L BOTA +47 105
>Marsh: MOSSS L8 ..OMS +18 82
#note This play had me really concerned, turned out she had 3 S's. 
>Matt: FHIJLMU 5E FUM.LI +22 127
#note This is one of my proudest play so fhe tournament.  The top half of the board is shut down and I've dumped most of the drek from my rack.  Maybe I'll draw an A for K11 next turn.
>Marsh: DELSST D8 .ELDTS +20 102
>Matt: AHIIJUY C7 JAY +48 175
#note Felt better to take this now, and save my H K11 HUI next turn.
>Marsh: DFSU 7M FUD +29 131
#note Scored as 28.
>Matt: ?HIIRRU K11 HUI +28 203
>Marsh: EES 10I EE +12 143
>Matt: ?AAIORR 13B RO.ARIAn +66 269
#note No reaon to give her an easy bingo lane by hooking HUI#.  Time to play defense and grind this out.
>Marsh: AACT B11 CA.AT +14 157
>Matt: EEINNRR 15B .ERRINE +24 293
#note REAVOWING for 48, but again I'm in defense mode.  Besides fitting something in Row 14 the bingo lanes are shut down. 
>Marsh: AOSVY 4B SAVOY +32 189
#note Scored as 36.
>Matt: KNNORTW 14H WOK +27 320
#note More defense, although this might be paranoid.  4J KNOWN looks fine.
>Marsh: DEEX B2 DE.EX +58 247
#note Ouch.
>Matt: ENNPRST A5 PENT +31 351
#note Can't justify REAVOWING with that leave, I'll take the 31 and undouble my N's.  Man do I hate doubled N's.
>Marsh: BZ 3A B.Z +50 297
>Matt: AGHNPRS G7 H.P +24 375
#note No reason to do anything in the northeast quadrant now, that would just be opening for her.
>Marsh: AI 3F AI +9 306
>Matt: AGILNRS I3 GI.L +20 395
#note I may have broken CP with this position.  I just don't see where she's gonna bingo after GILL empties the bag, so I went with it.  
>Marsh: ?CEIORT 15J ORCEIn +36 342
#note E(UTE)TECTOId also plays for 36!
