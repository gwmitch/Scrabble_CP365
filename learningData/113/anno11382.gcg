#note it sucks having to bingo and give him good letters to bingo through.

>JD: AEGJOTV E5 JOG. +24 98
#note I am surprised that AEGTV is at all decent, but it scores as much next turn as AETV does after JOGS.
>Alan_Kait: FOX F4 FOX +63 134
>JD: ADEINTV G3 VAT +25 123
#note I was trying to block easy plays on column H while still keeping a good leave.

#note taking the points with FOZY is not a bad idea.

>JD: FIMORTZ A10 FIZ +33 268
#note I saw comfit and decided on fiz instead. fiz seems to do a better job of controlling the board. during opens I'm more of a fan of the james approach where you just play scrabble than the kenji method of changing how you play drastically in response to your opponent. that said, I believe you want to make lower-rated opponents make tough plays - and here taking column A takes away the easiest spot to find a play.

#note I was pretty happy with this play. it was a tough find.

>JD: EEKLNRS 11D ELK +22 334
#note in retrospect this is pretty dangerous with all the Ds out. INKLE is a nice option but it's close.

>JD: GLOY 11K LOGY +20 513
#note it's actually best now to play O at 11J, unblockably setting up GLEY.

#note that was a good close game to start with and get warmed up.
