#note Couldn't decide whether WIGGA# or WAGGA# was a word. It's both, of course.

#note This is statically in the mix, but the sim absolutely despises it. JINX K6 leads the way -- interesting. This board is loaded with floating tiles to find eights, so the bingo-prone EIRT leave becomes stronger.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EIMOTTT O2 TOTEMI.T +61 201
>Evans_Clinchy: IIIJKRT K6 JI.K +29 127
#note Sims better than TIKI N1. No reason to hoard the J with no plan to get rid of it. Let's move on and try to bingo soon...

#note That was lucky.

#note I think it's gotta be either this or LOFT in the same spot. Sure, OF 12D is the obvious equity play, but with this deficit, I need multiple bingo lines, so this is a step in the right direction.

>Brad_Whitmarsh: AIU 4B .UAI +26 409
>Evans_Clinchy: AADENTU 3E AUA +6 370
#note Debatable, but I like this best. I can either try to score and outrun with a play like RUANA A11 (looks unlikely to work), or I can open a bingo and pray. I think the two best plays here are AUA# and ATUA# in this spot... I went with AUA because the DENT leave seems to fit well with a pool that's loaded with A's and O's. Lots of different three-tile draws might hit.
