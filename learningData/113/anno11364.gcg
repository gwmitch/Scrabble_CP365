>Brian_Guilbault: AEN 8F ANE +6 6
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIMORR G7 I.FORMER +69 69
#note I was nearly positive REINFORM was fine, but still chickened out and played this instead at great risk. Also, RE(N)IFORM and (A)ERIFORM.
>Brian_Guilbault: ACEN E8 CANE +18 24
>Matthew_Larocque: ?JOOTTV F5 JOT. +15 84
#note What a mess. One of those positions where you question if this is really the best you can do. Sim says play this or V(E)TO.
>Brian_Guilbault: AHR F13 RAH +14 38
#note Don't have to worry about that anymore!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIIOTV 12G .OTIVE +24 108
#note (M)OnITIVE or a 9 through AR.
>Brian_Guilbault: LRUY D11 RULY +16 54
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEFINY 13L FEY +23 131
>Brian_Guilbault: ?CDENTU I2 CoUNTED +68 122
#note As he wrote down "O" on the blank slip, he announced "zeeeroooo". Does that mean I can challenge? lol. I knew what he meant so I didn't start some asinine arguement.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EINOOR C6 EROsION +62 193
#note Well shame on me for not seeing the disconnected nines for 110. Noob! This is really the only bingo I saw.
>Brian_Guilbault: DEKNOTT 3G KN.TTED +32 154
#note I'm pretty sure he told me he had KNOTTED on his rack - if so, he missed playing it for 96.
>Matthew_Larocque: BHIIIOS B6 HOB +35 228
#note With all those As, I should have thought twice about this. But I don't like the sim's choice of IBIS 2K. This board has several good hotspots so I didn't think I should have gotten shy about scoring.
>Brian_Guilbault: AOZ A8 AZO +51 205
>Matthew_Larocque: AIIIMST 5H I.IA +8 236
#note Yeah, why not just play A(N)IMI instead.
>Brian_Guilbault: ASX O13 SAX +40 245
>Brian_Guilbault: ASX --  -40 205
#note He gives me a break.
>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNSTU H14 MU +17 253
#note A1 ANIMUS, which actually has nothing to do with ANIMI/ANIME or ANIMA. This sims second.
>Brian_Guilbault: AWX D4 WAX +39 244
>Matthew_Larocque: AAINSST M11 AS.A +16 269
#note I wanted to dangle the A hoping to draw a bingo - it also stops any plays on the bottom row.
>Brian_Guilbault: BW L2 W.B +16 260
>Matthew_Larocque: IINPSTU N13 .IP +20 289
>Brian_Guilbault: IL O14 LI +21 281
>Matthew_Larocque: GILNSTU N5 LUSTING +65 354
#note I actually almost missed this, yikes. LUTINGS is valid too! And FLUTINGs. lol.
>Brian_Guilbault: OPS 8L PO.S +27 308
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGLQV J11 Q. +11 365
#note QA(T) cause it scores 17.
>Brian_Guilbault: DDEEGRS 11L D.. +12 320
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGILV 2L .IVE +23 388
#note I guess play GIVE/GAVE B12 because he'll score less next turn.
>Brian_Guilbault: DEEGRS O1 G.ED +24 344
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGL E1 GALE +10 398
#note Play it at B12, duh.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ERS) +6 404
#note A rare game with no scoring errors.
