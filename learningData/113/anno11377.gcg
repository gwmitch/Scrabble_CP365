>JD: BCEEOVV 8G COVE +18 18
#note with all the hooks this offers, COVE sims better placed al the way left
>DaCronic: AHMO G6 MO.HA +17 17
>JD: BEGNUUV F5 VUG +18 36
#note strange rack, strange sim results. I figured my play would be right up there but there are 5 options that sim above, including BEGUN at either K4 or F10, VAGUE and BUG. I have no idea how to choose, but is leaving UV really my best choice here?
>DaCronic: ACEHIL H10 HELIAC +41 58
#note sweet word! I held until I remembered HELIACAL being good.
>JD: ABEENPU F10 BEAU +26 62
#note kind of a gambling play, but I like gambling. maybe he'll sacrifice some points to block.
>DaCronic: EFSSU 14B FUSES +29 87
>JD: EINOOPR 15A REPO +33 95
#note pecorino was always going to get blocked, unfortunately.
>DaCronic: AII 12F .A.II +5 92
>JD: EIMNOOW K4 WOMEN +30 125
#note given his fish, this seemed like the best way to minimize his chances of hitting.
>DaCronic: AEINOST 15H .ANOEIST +83 175
>JD: AINOOPS L2 POON +24 149
#note in collins, I would have a devastating reply...ANOOPSIA at 14H. Too bad about OO#. again, I liked setting up a threat for him to worry about here so that conrad can't just shape the board to his will.

>DaCronic: EEERYZ N3 EERY +29 244
#note this is a pretty cool decision. He kept EZ, he said later.
>JD: ?BDILTT M9 BIT +26 269
#note tied at this point, I think it's too early to go for a move like BITT. all he has to do is play down column O and BITT was in vain.
>DaCronic: ?DEIRTZ 1M .EZ +45 289
>JD: ?DILTTW 13K W.LT +14 283
#note all of a sudden I'm down a bunch. I debated between this and TWILIT. I thought I needed to make a threat, but it's still so easy for him to play at O6 - TWILIT conceals the fact that I have the blank and gives me a better chance at drawing useful vowels like the A. against a sharp tactician like conrad this isn't going to cut it.
>DaCronic: EORY O6 OYER +26 315
>JD: ?DDIRRT 10J DI..T +19 302
#note I was lost here, but I have one top option...DIRDUM at 6B to throw open that side of the board. this doesn't accomplish much.
>DaCronic: AIQU J2 QUAI +48 363
>JD: ?DDGNRT 6D DR.. +7 309
#note gotta try something, right? quackle is bad at evaluating this position because it opens the board for me on the sim.

#note I went over by 10 - well done to conrad, he controlled this game at the end.
