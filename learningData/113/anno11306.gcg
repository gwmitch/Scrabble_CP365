>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEEGINS 7G GEE +17 126
#note MT: Thought I was opening an S hook, but it was already there.
>Lucas_Freeman: ?ILORRT 4B .ORTLIeR +68 202
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEINSTU I3 U. +3 129
#note MT: Sims close to playing off an E, too. I guess TINES bingoes more often.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEINSTZ 3A N.ZE +50 179
>Lucas_Freeman: ?AIPRRS J5 RASPIeR +65 288
#note LGF: Keeping my play as defensive as possible, though not being sure of GEEP kept me from playing RIPRAPS.

>Lucas_Freeman: BIIORTT 1N BI +25 313
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEFNOT F7 A..NE +29 281
#note LGF: AGEES* is phony. I didn't see the A at first, thought Matthew had played GONE. 
MT: Yikes! Did I really make AGEES*? I didn't even realize.

>Lucas_Freeman: BCIIMNU K4 MIB +31 419
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGHOWY 2C AHOY +36 349
#note MT: I9 HOAGY is probably better. Need to unload as many clunkers as possible for a shot at a bingo. But the unseen pool is wretched anyways.
