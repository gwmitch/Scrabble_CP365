>Jackson_Smylie: ?ILNOST 11B pONTILS +70 172
#note Well. I fail. I knew BEDUS* was no good, but I just didn't see any other bingos. I figured either he accepts, challenges bedus and pontils (= bingoes next turn), or challenges and only types in pontils (implausible, but possible). I guess I should have just seen the 20ish bingos available. SoLITON/STONILy are best. Damn.

>Roger_Cullman: IIIII -IIIII +0 57
>Jackson_Smylie: CEEGPRY F2 YEP +24 280
#note In general I don't like G's, but I figured YEP would be better than PEG, not just for the 5 point score difference, but because CERY and CEGR don't seem to be thattt much apart. Only speedy prefers PEG, sim perfers YEP, but G(AB)Y is best
>Roger_Cullman: ISX J6 XIS +30 87
>Jackson_Smylie: CCEGIRV 14B .EV +6 286
#note Tiansa'd. I didn't know CERCI, and REV is awful equity-wise, but he just doesn't bhingo unless he knows REEST (which I don't think he does). 
>Roger_Cullman: LOTU K4 LOUT +19 106
>Jackson_Smylie: CCGILNR 3K CLIC +23 309
#note I see CLING(Y), which keeps the nice CR and scores 24. But he could triple triple and I don't want him winning. I know CLIC* is a phoney. 

The reasoning behind CLIC* is that he has one bingo lane, and that is the one pluralizing IT. I cannot block ITS. My only hope of defending against a bingo is by giving him another bingo line. I am assuming he won't challenge CLIC*. If he doesn't challenge it, that likely means he will pluralize it if he can bingo with an S. Then I can challenge off his bingo. Quackle won't like it because it assumes Roger will not play CLICS* if given the chance. Also, if Roger challenges it off, there is a small change he opens me up for CIRCLING :)

#note Met gives me ZI(T) maybe next turn. Now that I have the ?, I'm not too worried about him bingoing.

>Roger_Cullman: LOS 8B SOL +27 243
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ADEIST O3 STAIDEr +83 491
#note I see no reason why he would challenge CLICS* after not challenging CLIC* unless he didn't see CLIC or something.

#note I'm really happy to have won this tournament - I haven't won a tourney since July 2011. I can't say I was mistreated by the tile gods, I got very good tiles in almost all my games. That being said, i think I played relatively well, although I could have played better. Happy face. Thanks to all my opponents to being gracious about luck and thanks for a great year at club.
