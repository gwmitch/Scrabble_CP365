>Chris_Canik: EGIINNV 8D VEINING +80 80
#note It sure helps to start with a baby bingo against someone clearly better than me.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AGILOSV G2 SALVOI.G +66 66
>Chris_Canik: ABILRTU I3 TRIBU.AL +63 143
#note Tough decision between TRIBU(N)AL and TURBI(N)AL. Because I'm not psychic, I pick one at random.
>Geoff_Thevenot: JO J2 JO +27 93
>Chris_Canik: CDEEIOO K1 COOEE +26 169
#note DE(V)O(I)CE is very pretty. Too bad I didn't know it. I really don't like leaving the C in the triple line, but the rack is too ugly to skip this play.
>Geoff_Thevenot: HINO 1K .HINO +42 135
>Chris_Canik: ADFGITZ 6K DITZ +43 212
#note F(L)I(R)T(E)D is pretty, and also better than DITZ. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?EEHLLR 11C HELLERs +78 213
>Chris_Canik: AAFGRRS 2M FAR +23 235
#note (L)A(R)G(E)R. Stop it, tile gods. Also better is AGRAF(E), which I definitely don't know. This is next, marginally better than FR(I)AR or FR(I)G at L4.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ABDTTU E3 ABUTT.D +20 233
>Chris_Canik: AEGIRSU H10 A.GUER +29 264
#note I don't enjoy blowing up this rack, but the bingo lanes are sparse anyway, so I'm not exhausting opportunities by doing so. This is best.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ENY O6 YEN +36 269
>Chris_Canik: ?INOQRS H1 QI +35 299
#note I was half-expecting to have missed a really cool 8 here, but I didn't. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AW 4C WA. +16 285
>Chris_Canik: ?DENORS 15A eNDORSE. +77 376
#note I don't like RODSmEN at B8, but I should've gone for iNDORSE(R) over eNDORSE(R). 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ST 3I ...TS +22 307
>Chris_Canik: AEFKMRY 12B KEF +35 411
#note Interestingly, Quackle likes KEF best. KYAR hits the double letter, but I agree that it's better to totally kill the lane. However, KAF would've been smarter, because the X is still in the bag for (HE)X. And just to spite me for not making the defensively correct play, Geoff has the X. Definite mistake by me.
>Geoff_Thevenot: ISX 13A SIX +52 359
>Chris_Canik: AADMORY 3B RAY. +29 440
#note Bahhhhhh. This is the play that makes me feel like I don't deserve the (spoiler alert) win. I chicken out on (KI)R(N) and/or (HEX)A(D). RAYA fits much more nicely at 14B. It's almost worse that I saw it and chickened out instead of just missed it entirely. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: E C11 ...E. +16 375
>Chris_Canik: ADMNOOW 2B OW +23 463
#note A better play is probably to make a lower-scoring parallel on ARGUER or DITZY/YEN to block potential bingo lanes. I can be assured that if he draws a bingo, Geoff will find it - and therefore I should really be playing a bit more cautiously. However, I at least realize that I absolutely canNOT empty the bag, just in case he does bingo. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: CEIPPTU 14H .UPEPTIC +90 465
>Chris_Canik: AADEMNO O12 MA.E +33 496
#note MANDA(T)E wins by one more point. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: M 13H .M +14 479
>Geoff_Thevenot:  (ADNO) +10 489
