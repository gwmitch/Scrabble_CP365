>Matthew_Larocque: AEILSWY 8G WILY +20 20
#note So it's the last round and I'm 10-3 while Juraj is 9-4. However, his spread is better than mine so I don't have a choice but to win. I briefly consider trying *WILEY, but I decide that games like these are not the time to try stupid things.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: OOP 7F POO +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFRSV J5 CAV. +14 34
#note V(OW) is a pretty good idea in retrospect. The leave will bingo with I, O, E, or U, as well as R H and D. It creates two lanes which I possibly overlooked.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: IY 5I I.Y +16 30
>Matthew_Larocque: EFINRSX 4G FIX +23 57
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ACEIRSZ 3B CRAZIES +96 126
#note Well that was depressing to see.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILNRS 5A LINDERS +72 129
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILNRS --  -72 57
#note As for that statement about not doing stupid things in important games.... I'm not very rational when the chips are stacked against me! Plus, I was sure there was a bingo is this rack. He told me if I had played *ELDRINS instead he might have accepted, confusing it with ALDRINS ENDRINS and DIELDRIN. After I lost my turn I actually thought ELDRINS was good and I missed it.

>Juraj_Pivovarov: BEK D1 BE.K +38 182
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELRS 1D .EADLERS +83 166
#note So I've got LEADERS and DEALERS for 68, and I feel like it just won't be enough points to catch up unless something REALLY lucky happens. So I execute stupid play #2 in an attempt to go all-or-nothing. To my surprise he holds and ultimately lets the play go. Oh, and I probably didn't even see DE(C)LARES for 76 or I likely would have ended up playing it.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: OSSTT 9D TOST +13 195
#note I can only assume he had another S, and he was trying to neutralize this bingo line.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHIORW 8A WHOA +36 202

>Juraj_Pivovarov: ENNRSTU 10G STUNNER +67 272
#note Damn. Caught some momentum but he shuts me down.
>Matthew_Larocque: DDDILOQ -DDDOLQI +0 238
#note I didn't think I could afford to limp along with a Q that might not go anywhere, time to turf this dreck and try to get a blank. Sim still likes B12 ODD better.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIOV 12A .OVIE +20 292
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEJMRT M10 .AMJET +30 268
#note Who's afraid of a 3x3? Not me, not now!
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AEFLRT 15I FLAT.ER +33 325
>Matthew_Larocque: BDDDEIR 4K BIDED +29 297
>Juraj_Pivovarov: LOU O1 LOU. +15 340
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DOPQRU M1 QUO. +28 325
#note And the Q returns to ruin my attempt at a comeback. I did consider dumping it for 11 points, but what were the chances of a playable bingo? would I find it if I had one? Granted a small chance is better than nothing. Looks like the only bingos I could hope to get were PRODUCE 14C, ROUNDUP/TROUPED underneath MOVIE, and PRODUCE(R) O8. Despite all this, I had a 52 point play here that I never even came close to seeing. I would have been just as well to play QUODs N6.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?EGGINU 14A .GgING +22 362
#note He wanted to play GrUNGIE(R) but he couldn't pull the trigger.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DHPR L10 .tH +25 350
#note Too flustered and low on time to find the best plays all in the same spot.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EU B2 E.U +10 372
>Juraj_Pivovarov:  (DPR) +12 384
#note I ended up with 329 after the timer penalty. So close to a tournament win! I've had very few wins, but a lot of runner-ups and third place finishes. Juraj was humble about it, but I probably didn't deserve to win after that *LINDERS abomination.
