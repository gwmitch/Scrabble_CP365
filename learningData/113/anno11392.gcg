#note Little bit confused ZA F9 or ADZ 11I. Chose ZA because it was safer.... However....

#note My ZA enlarge his POLARISE!!!!
>Christian_O.B: ?AAILTT 7F LAT +18 64
#note Stupidity happened here.... Saw only RATTAIL but no place. Missed 7B LATItaT for 72, C6 TALIPATs for 72, D5 TAILcOAT for 66. And I should only place 7G AT for 17 leave LAIT? if I can't find bingo

>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: CEIKO D8 CO.KIE +30 164
>Christian_O.B: ?AEINTV 13C V.NTAIlE +72 161
#note Reason I chose this because 13C VENTAILE offers so many scoring oppoturnity (since all bingo I found will create high scoring spot, then I chose to open as much as possible, that he couldn't take all in one move. VENTAILE can be hooked AVENTAILE, with I in 13H and E in 13J, for additional high scoring spot, However...

>Christian_O.B: ACENOOT 15H COO +20 181
#note Quackle suggest only dump O in E10 LO for 16. I never studied OCTANE? stem, so I chose COO for 4 extra points

>Christian_O.B: AEHINTW M7 WHEATIN. +90 271
>Christian_O.B: AEHINTW --  -90 181
#note That was one of my stupidest gambling in whole tournament... Wait, probably in all scrabble tournament I joined
>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: IP 11D .IP +36 323
#note At that point, G.M Ricky was already 152 points ahead, HE WILL BE 6 VP ahead 2nd position, and with only 6 round to go with over 1800 points bigger spread from 2nd position, winning this game WILL GUARANTEE HIM to got 1st place with 6 rounds to go
>Christian_O.B: AEHINTW N10 WHA +37 218
#note Wanna know my winning percentage according to quackle, with 152 points behind and that remained tile? 1,1%. LOL

>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: UY L11 YU +35 398
#note I cannot use or block effectively that spot!!
>Christian_O.B: ?EINOTT N2 TOnTINE +70 307
#note Even with bingo my winning probability still LESS THAN 1% here
>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: INV O1 VIN +22 420
>Christian_O.B: EIORSSU 14D SUI +24 331
#note Actually I don't saw I can make SERIOUS here... Luckily no place either
>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: BE 12H BE +15 435
#note I don't know exactly why he chose this play. Probably aware of my Q
>Christian_O.B: EEOORST 2B OO +14 345
#note Very difficult analyzing here... Actually, AGAIN I didn't saw I can made OESTRONE or ROESTONE in 4H for 76. However I probably not choose to bingo in this situation if I spotted too. The 3 last tile was very, very unbalanced, with unseen Q.

So if I dump 2 tiles, and open other spot to bingo, if he already draw Q, he will forced to dump Q for only 11 points, and emptied the bag, if he can't make move that score 25 points, and his F will cost him victory, if high 70 bingo (over 75 points) will be just, just enough for me to win this game. This strategy and luck if I got bingo in my last turn will not work either, if he pass his turn, forced me to pick last tile.

Generally STORE is better than STEER, but for somehow I believe that STEER is more conducive now to form a bingo with 10 unseen tile (AFGLLNQRRS), except for Q. Q	uackle agree, after several time checking with championship player choice, it valuate 12B OO leave STEER give me approximately 15% to win, while 12B OE leave STORE give me approximately 10% to win

He IMMEDIATELY played LI, block the only Q play JUST AFTER I PRESS THE CLOCK, and STILL NOT TAKE THE REPLACEMENT TILE. It was very clear sign that Q still in bag, and I have to pick 2 from 3 last tile in bag, with Q. If I got Q, it will be impossible for me, to win, EVEN IF HE PASSED all turn and I play all best play with last 7 tile.
>G.M_Ricky_Purnomo: AFLNRRS 6M L. +2 437
#note Actually, if he don't block the only Q spot and play any move over 20 points here with F, the margin will be too big for me to catch him and he will guarantee to win
>Christian_O.B: EEGLRST 1C REGLETS +80 425
#note K2 REGLETS score 86 points, but I don't 100% sure that JIRD can be added S. So as I counted REGLETS C1 has already give me victory, I chose safe play
