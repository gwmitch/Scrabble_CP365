>Matt: ABEFNOZ 8D BONZE +38 38
#note Huh, BONZA#.  I guess that awful BF combo is worth 10 points for ZONAE.  It also doesn't give up the easy R hook.
>John: PRRU I6 PURR +25 25
#note RURP# is two more.
>Matt: AAFLNOV 9E FAA +26 64
#note Hah, the first two options are FLAVA# and AFRO#.  I like FLAVONE as another option, this is meh with the bad leave.
>John: ACOT 10B COAT +18 43
>Matt: CEILNOV C9 V.ILE +24 88
#note Maybe CLOVE J2?  I don't think I realized that spot scoredas well as C9.  I hate L's and N's together, which is why I passed up VOICE.
>John: AGLNO 12A GA.LON +18 61
#note ANALOG for 26 (though it opens the 3x3), also GOLLAN#.
>Matt: CDKNORS A12 .ROK +27 115
#note No open I or E, and didn't know GONK#.
>John: IMP 6F PIM. +16 77
>Matt: ACDINSW 14A .W +10 125
#note Only one 8 in this rack.  I'm not sure this is the best rack to fish to, something like WAD or DAW 13E is better.
>John: ?EGNSTU 13E NUGgETS +64 141
#note Also SURGENT#, ENGLUTS, NUTMEGS.
>Matt: ACDEINS K6 ACIDNES. +72 197
#note Scored as 70.

>John: HILOT L4 LITHO +30 171
>Matt: DEIISTV M3 VIDE +24 221
>John: GOX 5E GOX +35 206
>Matt: IIJLQST -IJLQ +0 221
#note Well that's not the draw I would like.  Lots of A's and E's to come, so keeping the L is probably alright.
>John: DEENU H10 DEN.UE +21 227
>Matt: AEEISTW J11 WE.A +16 237
#note Or WITE.
>John: ?AADEMS M8 SAMEDAy +73 300
>John: ?AADEMS --  -73 227
#note The valid playable bingoes are SMAAkED, SEAMAiD, and SAMbAED.  I've only seen SAMEDAY* as a hyphenated word, so I figured a challenge was pretty safe.
>Matt: AEILQST 7C QAT +33 270
#note Almost played this at 4D, then realized it gave him MADAmES atop AG and TOP.
>John: ?AADEMS 4D DAM +22 249
>Matt: EHILRSY 3C YEH +28 298
#note I am serious that this is my rack, and don't call me SHIRLEY*.  This makes 2 bingo lanes that start with S, so that hopefully I can respond when he hits back.  
>John: EI 3M .IE +6 255
>Matt: EILRSTU O1 UL. +9 307
#note I knew I needed to block the 3x3, but LIEU is probably better with 2 I's still out.  One benefit to ULE is that he can't bingo to the L in row 1.  With 2 R's unseen maybe URE# is the idea, it woould have made my next turn much easier.
>John: ?AENOST M8 SENATOr +67 322
#note ONSTEAD#/ONSTAGE# are 75 up top, and block my best play.
>Matt: EFIRRST 2A RIFTS +36 343
#note  I had him on BIIJNOY, so I saw BRIONY as a possibility after this play, but knew I had him J stuck afterwards.  Even ORBY isn't enough to outrun this.  Quackle's neat set up of REF N11 (followed by STIR O12 or 2E) is best
>John: BIIJORY A1 O.BY +39 361
>Matt: ER 14E ER +12 355
#note Final score recorded as 375-361.

>Matt:  (IIJR) +22 377
