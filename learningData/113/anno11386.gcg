>Matt_Canik: AEEELNU 8H ULNAE +12 12
#note Elected to play ULNAE over EAU or exchanging EEU because LN seems fairly unsynergistic. Quackiepoo disagrees.

>Matt_Canik: EEIMMRR M5 RIM +22 34
>April_McCarley: HP H7 H.P +8 28
#note April makes plays like this from racks of 7 consonants. So I can figure she's holding 5 consonants and is quite likely to draw into more. 
>Matt_Canik: DEEMQRT N4 DEEM +27 61
#note I like setting up O1 here because unless she draws 2 vowels, she probably won't hit the spot.

#note This holds EGLO for GLOZE next turn. Nifty. 
>April_McCarley: LNOOR G9 ORLON +12 89
>Matt_Canik: EGILNOP H1 GLO.E +45 190
#note This was a tough turn because there were so many good options. I looked at GIN(Z)O, GLO(Z)E, PO(L)LING, POLE H12, and PONG H12. I elected to play GLOZE here because I held the IN to go with that G I placed at 1H. Quackle thinks that's too cute and wants me to play GINZO.

#note She told me after the game that FOUNd held two As. So I guess she didn't want to play FAUNA.

#note I just played the first bingo I saw here. It's a club game and I didn't need to hear about how lucky I was getting any more.
