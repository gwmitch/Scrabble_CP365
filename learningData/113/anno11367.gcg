>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGIOS 8H AGIO +10 10
#note Another tournament deciding game. I'm starting to have a really bad track record with these. :/
>Mike_Ryan: ACIPRST K2 PISCAT.R +74 74
#note I held without realising this anagrams into APRICOTS.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGLMRS 4D GERMLES. +74 84
#note Phony, but unlike most of my phonies, at least this is SLIGHTLY plausible. He let me have it. With GLE(A)MERS in two spots I didn't actually need to take the risk here, but I probably would have thought "no, that's GLEANERS" to myself.
>Mike_Ryan: FLOO 5B FOOL +21 95
#note He was about to play LOOF instead but didn't like the implications.
>Matthew_Larocque: IMOORTU H1 MOU.T +21 105
#note This was tough to decide on. IM(P)ORT is a lot of points but I could get killed next turn. About 4-5 plays are clustered up, but O(P)IUM wins the sim.
>Mike_Ryan: DEZ 3C ZED +34 129
>Matthew_Larocque: INOQRSW 4A QI +26 131
#note or QIS for 40?
>Mike_Ryan: IXY 2K .IXY +32 161
>Matthew_Larocque: NORSVVW 6J V.V +17 148
#note  VROWS 10G/VOWS 10H are pretty close behind this. Still, VAV is one of those words that saves your ass more often than not.
>Mike_Ryan: FKLUY 9D FLUKY +25 186
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LNORSW D9 .LOWN +22 170
#note This felt wrong, like I was just suffering from word knowledge failure. But literally nothing is standing out in the sim. SWORN 10K seems stupid though.
>Mike_Ryan: AAB 1M ABA +31 217
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDIORS 13B SO.gBIRD +76 246
#note Or S(N)OwBIRD. There's a lot of bingos here actually. Didn't see DISRObe which goes down for 80 points - beats out SO(N)gBIRD/S(N)OwBIRD.
>Mike_Ryan: ACDE H11 AC.ED +33 250
#note I put a hold on this, Mike said after "I think it's one of the new ones". I guess I need more than 6 years to learn all the "new" words heh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHINOW 10F HI +32 278
#note I probably missed WHO(S)E for 38, HAW(S)E plays too which I didn't know. I still think this is ok.
>Mike_Ryan: AAEINRT 12H .ARINATE +75 325
#note That didn't help.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNOTW 13M WON +26 304
#note Ok, I seriously thought forever if WANTONE(D) was valid, but I just couldn't remember what the word meant. It could have been an adjective for all I knew. Either way my chances are really low if I don't play it, and damn it, the word is fine. I didn't have a problem playing GERMLESS, so why turn into a wimp now? Deserved loss for not trusting my gut.
>Mike_Ryan: GNOT 14K TONG +24 349
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEENT 9K .EE +4 308
#note Now look at the mess I'm in for "playing it safe". Bravo.
>Mike_Ryan: ?ADEERT B7 READiE.T +74 423
#note He didn't really miss all the words at 15A?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHJNT 8A J.E +30 338
#note Just play HAJ 8M or HAET A8 for the points.
>Mike_Ryan: RU M7 RU. +4 427
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHNPST 11K HAP +37 375
#note H(U)P 33 is cool, but I saw an out with TENS so I didn't hesitate.
>Mike_Ryan: EIINU 15F NU.IE +6 433
#note He's better off to play (AX)E for 20.
>Matthew_Larocque: ENST N6 TENS +14 389
#note This is only the 4th best play. SENT 6D, ES 3M, and TENS 6E.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (I) +2 391
#note I was underscored by 2, while he was overscored by 2.
