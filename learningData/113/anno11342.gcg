#note is there a better move? is HOUR better? at 5K? D3? those look like they give up too much points and are kind of reckless, especially 5K HOUR. but HAO also looks kind of crappy...

#note CRAP!! WHAT DO I DO? stuff like I11 NU, 8J NU or UN, 7L NU and 12H NU are looking best. especially after her two tile play. i did not really think too much of the two tile play when i did NATURE, although i knew it was burning equity. i think i like 7L NU. just dumping a U seems too easy to block.
