#note you thought last round was ugly? well, be prepared for the game that set scrabble back by twenty years, to the days before bingos.
>JD: DEIOOTU 9I OUTDO +14 14
#note outvie sims best. I guess setting up the hook is not a bad move.

#note ABUNA#
>JD: EEEEGIZ 8M GEE +15 53

>JD: CINRTTY N5 TYN. +15 107
#note it seemed like it was time to close the board as mch as possible given that he must be getting close. I believe I saw TYIYN and passed on it. quackle likes tyiyn much better bien sur.
>Ron_Gideons: ADOS 10K S.DA +25 121
>JD: CHIRRTT N10 .ITCH +20 127
#note quackle is bad at closed boards. I have no intresting in playing AIRTH. I guess I can see THIRTY or THIR being better.

>JD: AEIRRTV B12 VAIR +35 162
#note it's pretty awesome for me if he keeps opening and I get to close.
