>April_McCarley: AEILNOR 8D ALIENOR +66 66
>Chris_Canik: AEIINSU J6 AU.EI +9 9
#note Starting off with a mistake... awesome. Q likes U(N)AI H7 a little better, and also INU(L)ASE, which is probably best, even if Q has it second to U(N)AI. AU(R)EI is close, though.
>April_McCarley: HMO 9G HOM. +34 100
>Chris_Canik: ?CFINSS 7I C.IFS +24 33
#note F(A)SCINeS. I saw it and chickened out. Also COM is phoney. This is a close second (third) to FINS K5, if COM is allowed. I'm terrible at this game, apparently.
>April_McCarley: AFLP K10 FLAP +23 123
>Chris_Canik: ?BEENQS F7 Q. +11 44
#note Interesting simulation states that Q likes QuE(A)N better than Q(I). I guess the 35-point difference is worth sacrificing the blank to Quackle. I disagreed... but given my last two plays, I'm obviously not at my best in this game.
>April_McCarley: A 6J .A +4 127
>Chris_Canik: ?BDEENS 14H BEDSENt +86 130
#note My play in this game is atrocious. BEDSENt is a phoney, but if it's allowed to be simulated by Quackle anyway, it is best. Highest-simming legitimate bingo is (A)BSENtED.
>April_McCarley: ?ADEINR 15C sANDIER +88 215
>Chris_Canik: AEIRSSY L10 SAY +30 160
#note Hey, I finally make the right play. 
>April_McCarley: IWZ 14B WIZ +42 257
>Chris_Canik: AEIRSWX 13A WAX +49 209
>April_McCarley: DU J12 DU. +16 273
>Chris_Canik: EIJRRSV D7 J.RVIS +32 241
#note My third phoney of the game. Not even a good one - JIVER(S) or JIVE(S) in the M column is better by a good margin. This is next-best.
>April_McCarley: BIKL M3 BILK. +22 295
>Chris_Canik: EEEGLRV 11B GR.EVE +20 261
#note Not the best play, once again... but at least it's valid. Quackle likes things like EVE N1 or REG(I)VE 11A better... I dislike the free triple word that either of those plays give her. I've gotten to a point where bingoing isn't a prerequisite for winning at this point, and so I need to outscore her - handing out free triple word scores isn't the way to do that. Honorable mention goes to VEL(I)GER 11A, though. 
>April_McCarley: D 11B ......D +12 307
#note She's fishing... that's not good for me.
>Chris_Canik: ELMPTUU 4J UPL.T +14 275
#note Yet another miss of the proper play. Q likes MU 15L, and then either PLUTE(I) or TUMUL(I) better at 4H. Once again, I'm not a fan of the free triple these give her, but I won't pretend to have seen PLUTE(I). 
>April_McCarley: NO 3J NO +8 315
>Chris_Canik: EEIMOOU 15L MEOU +37 312
#note If I hadn't seen this, I'd've just quit playing this game for life. It's the only scoring play Quackle recommends over exchanging.
>April_McCarley: GO 13G GO +10 325
>Chris_Canik: AEEIOTY N2 YE.I +20 332
#note This is where I'm just asking to lose. Sure, let's give her a free bingo lane after she's fished for three turns. Even despite this, Q has it fairly high on the simulation list. (V)IE or (V)OE F11 are better, as well as EY(R)A or AE(R)O at 9B. Then again, she made a very disgruntled noise when she drew after GO, so I'm tempted to believe she still doesn't have a bingo.
>April_McCarley: TTTT -TTTT +0 325
>Chris_Canik: AEEHOOT O5 TOEA +15 347
#note I want to quickly correct my mistake from the previous play, and TOEA is the only way to do it and still hit the triple. I can't effectively block the G(NU) hook, as H(OP) or T(OP) leave hooks. I'm also a bit more worried about this spot than the B4 -ING spot, even though I and N are both still in the pool.
>April_McCarley: EGR O1 REG +23 348
>Chris_Canik: ACEHNOT B9 CO. +8 355
#note Despite playing absolutely terribly during this game, I actually play the endgame correctly (and intentionally, too). There are two winning plays here. However, we've miscounted our game, and we have the score at 358-348 right now in her favor (ALIENOR was inexplicably overcounted by 10, and BEDSENt was overcounted by 1). CHAN(G) loses with these scores, whereas CO(G) wins. Basically, anything that blocks TROTTIN(G) and doesn't give her a comeback on the triple wins, which is rather simply accomplished by CO(G).
