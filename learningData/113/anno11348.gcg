>Matt: DEEELYZ 8G ZED +26 26
#note Oh was it ever tempting to swap an E for a chance at LAYDEEZ#.  I do see Q's point that ZEE > ZED now.  Not sure what I was thinking then.
>Marsh: DDMUY I5 MUD.Y +18 18
>Matt: AEEILOY H1 YALIE +31 57
#note Whoa I thought this was good for sure.  Just YALE#.  ALEYE# is 40 and best.
>Marsh: EFH J4 FEH +35 53
>Matt: AEGIOQS 4J .OGIE +18 75
>Marsh: ADG 3K GAD +22 75
#note Scored as 23.
>Matt: AAOOOQS -AOOOQ +0 75
#note Yeah, that's not very pretty, let's start over.

#note If I've annotated this right, this plays for 52.
>Matt: DEENNPS 1K SPEND +38 287
#note The S is kind of week right now, so I'll SPEND it for 38.
>Marsh: AIINOTT L3 ..ITATION +61 252
#note Awesome! At first I heard 16 and thought she had played a non-bingo.  Kind of want my S back now.
>Matt: BENORTU K9 BOUT +22 309
#note Since I can't take it, I don't want to get hit myself.  Sacrifices 4 points from N6.
>Marsh: IX M7 XI +36 288
>Matt: EENORTV 9E OV.R. +13 322
#note Pretty ugly, nothing wrong with taking the points with NEVE.  I didn't want to give an easy bingo lane back with both blanks out.
>Marsh: ?AEFRSU A7 A.UiFERS +70 358
#note QUAFFERS is 119, but this seals the game after my last draw.  She wasn't sure, and I'd take the sure bingo as well.
>Matt: AEENPTW E11 W.P +16 338
#note I needed to block SUITLIKE without giving back anything else.  TANE# or NETE# B10 does that and leaves an outplay.
>Marsh: ?EIKLTU 14A .ILKs +24 382
>Matt: AEENT J11 NAE +8 346
#note blocking UTE to go out, leaving EXIT for next turn.

>Matt: ET M6 E..T +20 366
#note We made a couple of mistakes on her score, ended up at 388-368.
