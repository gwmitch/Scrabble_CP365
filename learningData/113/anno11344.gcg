#note I was all set to play LUXE 10H until this popped out at me.  Find a play, then find a better one.

#note Right idea, wrong execution.  DEL/(E/T) 2 over.  
>John: AEFI H1 FAI.E +24 237
#note Yep, that's a phony.  I knew FAINE#, and this seemed reasonable since I don't have my #-5's cold.  He could also have just played AFIRE too.  
>Matt: AEHOPTU 15F OUPH +32 314
#note Yeah, no reason to tack on the E and give him a big comeback at 14J.  
>John: OO 6I OO. +16 253
>Matt: AELOTTT N2 TO.AL +22 336
#note No E for TEETOTAL.  I really didn't like this play after I made it, since I gave him another bingo lane unnecessarily.  Something like TOUT 10B looks much better.
>John: EIR 11I REI +19 272
>Matt: AENOOTT O6 OAT +11 347
#note Ditched the A since there were 3 left to draw, vs. only one O.  He's obviously close to a bingo, so I'm taking away the triple I opened last turn, but I'm not sure still what is right here.
>John: AHI E4 AHI +31 303
#note Oh crap.  Should have played down column C last turn apparently.
>Matt: DEINOOT 14H OON +14 361
#note I chickened out on OINTED#, which layed at 14 I blocks the most lanes. It's probably not enough though on this board if he has one or both blanks.  This is kind of meh, but could lead to an answer to his bingo next turn at least.
>John: ??ABEER 12G tEnEBRA +80 383
#note Also phony.  I knew it was a sticky E in TWL, and I held for a while as I attempted to work out the possibilities for my comeback.  If he plays cErEBRA or one of the other bingoes available I'm probably sunk.  I decided to let this go and respond, since I figured the 10 extra points if I'm wrong would be crucial.
>Matt: DEEFINT N10 FIEND +42 403
#note Well, I'm not going to beat myself up for not knowing INFEFTED#.  I figured this scored enough to outrun him in the endgame.
>John: CDLQRST L3 Q.T +14 397
>Matt: ADETV 11C V.. +9 412
#note Seeing the TWINK hook would have been useful here.  I al least should have seen VADE# M7.  This is awful because it gives him a great comeback with no vowels.
>John: CDLRS F7 C..DS +22 419
>Matt: ADET 1H .ATED +11 423
#note Again blind to M7, but I think I was also low on time here.  Ugly endgame but effective.
>Matt:  (LR) +4 427
