#note After a simiulation, M2 QI hits the top, then QADI, then this.  I guess QADI is less dangerous based on what happened next, but QI just seems silly to me, better leave be damned.

#note Quackle wants me to fish off one vowel.  I like opening another bingo lane, and just DI seems too easy to block.
>Marsh: BDRUX K9 .XURB +28 295
#note She mentioned that she was puzzled by what my last move meant, so just went for points and balance.  She mentioned having a D at the time, so BRUXHED is definitely right, she just chickened out IIRC.
>Matt: AEEIRRT 13C TEARIER +74 284
#note I still have RETAILER up top if she did block, but I'm back in it now.
>Marsh: ADH H12 H.AD +36 331
#note Blocking ZEBU for 75.
>Matt: ABGJUVZ M12 JAG +46 330
#note Quackle agrees to take this spot first, saving the Z for M7 next turn, but it suggests BAJU# and VAG# over this.  I thought I had to keep the B for BIZ next turn.  I like VAG# best now, holding onto the J and Z for later on a pretty closed board.
>Marsh: EFINS 14B FINES +35 366
#note NIFES# is 38, but with the K still out unnecessarily volatile.
>Matt: BELTUVZ 7K B.Z +45 375
#note I decided to cash the Z now, and hope to play through the UV next turn.  
>Marsh: OW 2E WO +18 384
#note Excellent play by Marsh here.  She's set up two triples, and if she has the K and a blank here she's going to hit one of them for big points.
>Matt: EHLLTUV 1D VET +21 396
#note I saw KNIVes up top, figuring she had both blanks at this point, and played this.  I liked HULL 1F better, as it gives me more flexibility in the end game, but I'm sunk at this point.

>Marsh: ?AIKNNV 15A KANe +31 415
#note This leaves VIN to go out, and even with the other blank I can't score enough to win.  At least I blocked KNAVe up top. 
>Matt: ?HLLU C3 .aH +14 410
#note Hey, I actually did this right!  I have DULL or LULL to go out next turn, and her outplay is removed.
>Marsh: INV 15H .IV +7 422
#note She didn't see LULL (I almost missed it too).
>Matt: LLU 1H .ULL +4 414
#note We both miscounted some plays at the end, final score recorded as 427-413.
>Matt:  (N) +2 416
