>Michael_McClennan: CDEIINT 8B INCITED +76 76
#note IDENTIC 8F is more defensive.
>Jackson_Smylie: AAEGIOU F4 AGOU.I +9 9
#note -5.0 GUAIA(C).

#note -3.3 AMA. 
>Michael_McClennan: DELNRST B3 TENDR.LS +65 155
#note He spends over 5 minutes on this play and doesn't know/forgets that TRINDLES is good.

>Michael_McClennan: EJOY C1 JOEY +43 198
>Jackson_Smylie: BEOOTTU A10 OUTBET +29 108
#note I knew OUTBET* was a phoney, but I know to be in this game at ALL I need to get some points and some bingos. Any other play was something like (D)OUBT or something worth nothing. I figured I needed OUTBET to go unchallenged.
>Michael_McClennan: IVY 1C .IVY +18 216
#note (T)IVY...?
>Jackson_Smylie: CORRUUW 13A .URROW +22 130
>Michael_McClennan: ??BFINR 12E BaRFINg +72 288
#note Wow Mike. FuRIBuN(D). You really slacked off on your low prob 8s studying. Also BeFRIeN(D) and BoNFIRe.
>Jackson_Smylie: AACORUX 9F .XORA +41 171
#note I am 100% fail. I saw (F)AUX but somehow talked myself out of its validity. God. Wow. I just thought it was FALX and I was kidding myself. Stupid me. -9.1 FAUX.
>Michael_McClennan: EIV H12 .IVE +30 318
>Jackson_Smylie: AACDOPU 11D PACA +35 206
#note Win %: 0.22. It's called losing.

#note T(A)P...?
>Jackson_Smylie: DEIORUW 10J WUD +28 234
#note Although WUD doesn't take an S and there is a chance I draw one of the 3 unseen S's, it still allows me to bingo. 
>Michael_McClennan: DEEGIST L3 DIGESTE. +74 397
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIORSZ 14G O.ERSIZE +100 334
#note Boooooom. I won't win, but I will make ensure I'm pleased with this game. 
>Michael_McClennan: AEMN 15L NAME +39 436
>Jackson_Smylie: EEGHNNO 2F ONE +12 346
#note I'm pretty sure I got this endgame right, so I'm happy.
>Michael_McClennan: LLOQS 4K Q.S +12 448
>Jackson_Smylie: EGHN H1 H.NGE +33 379
#note I didn't play perfectly, making mistakes on AGOU(T)I, AA, and (I)XORA, but I felt I played quite well, especially with O(V)ERSIZE. I was quite pleased with the turnout of this game even though it meant my chance of winning the tournament was 25%ish (artificially raised because my rating is higher than my opponents').
