#note where's da O when you need it? also, neither of us were actually sure this was good. it is.

#note greet, turtle and gut all sim close. I don't mind TEG, since there are a lot of different kinds of inferences to make about it potentially.

>JD: ELLNRTU 5I LUNT +14 99
#note I'd rather play NULL
>Conrad_BB: MRY F6 M...RY +31 134
>JD: EEILNRZ L2 NER.Z +28 127
#note this play shows bad judgement. I open a lot and keep nothing particularly good. keeping the Z is fine on this tight board. a play like REIN looks quite good, or REBAR.

#note meh? need some kind of lane, but no N is available so I'd have to draw the blank. maybe just or?

#note I'm blocking at this point. maybe I should still keep wishing but conrad will block if it looks at all threatening.
>Conrad_BB: AHS L10 SHA +26 394

#note ZETA holding the F sims best. This threatens a sneaky out, but conrad is too good!
