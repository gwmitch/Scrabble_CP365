>Jeremy: AEIORUU -AIOUU +0 0
#note Quackle's choice, exch IOUU, keep AER -2.8
>Ross: DFI H7 DIF +14 14
#note Opening vertically makes baby Jesus cry.
>Jeremy: AEIORWZ I3 ZOWIE +32 32
#note Seems pretty clear cut.  ZOWIE at G3 sims a bit worse giving away the TWS too easily.
>Ross: DOTY J4 DOTY +29 43
>Jeremy: ANNRRUV 4H V..UN +26 58
#note edges out K3 VAN.  When in doubt, ditch UV.
>Ross: ILOTT G8 TOIL +13 56
#note Ross put down TOIT first, so I know he has a T on board.
>Jeremy: AABNRRR F10 BARN +24 82
#note there aren't any really good moves here, but this is the best of them.
>Ross: HIKT 13C THI.K +34 90
>Jeremy: AAERRSU 11C AUR.. +10 92
#note 12A UREA -6.4.  I don't really like stringing a scoring lane wide open like Quackle says. At this point we've each been going for a bingo for four turns each.  I'll take the defense with a tidier leave.
>Ross: DEFOX I9 FOXED +35 125
>Jeremy: AEEIRSW J10 WIRE +42 134
#note Scores, defends, keeps a tidy leave, and sets up the S if I don't draw a bingo.
>Ross: GHT K2 TH.G +30 155
>Jeremy: AAAERSV K8 AVES +40 174
#note K11 SAVE -2.2.  I totally disagree.  That move is suicide.  Gives Ross a high scoring bingo lane, and if he lands it, I'm painted into a corner with no way out.
>Ross: GINP 8K .PING +33 188
#note Ross pointed out that PING fit nicely at 12A for four more points.
>Jeremy: AAEJNRT 3K .AJ +28 202
#note Quackle agrees.  I was torn between this an N6 JA(N)E.  I liked JA(N)E because it blocked some bingos, but keeping AENRT that seemed like a silly idea.  Let's go offense now.
>Ross: BDEEY 14J DEBYE +43 231
#note I held this for over a minute.  I looked really bad at first, but it kept looking more and more familiar in time.  Funny thing is I'm sure I've played it before.
>Jeremy: AENRSST M5 STA.NERS +60 262
#note M5 ART(I)NESS and STA(I)NERS win the equity race, but 03 STRAN(G)ES locks down the board with a 31 point lead.  Because I was only 90% sure on STRANGES, I chose something definite.
>Ross: AEILMNT O6 TE.MINAL +62 293
#note yeah, that cost me.
>Jeremy: ?AEGOPR 12A PARGE. +44 306
#note PARGE(R)* is phony, however I like this play.  It's plausible, and puts opponent in a bind.  Best non-phony is 15L AERO,  phony is +10.7 points better, but -25.7 points worse than AERO if I have to pick it up.
>Ross: IQ N2 QI +36 329
#note oof
>Jeremy: ?ACCLOO A12 .OCO +24 330
#note Probably the closest I'll ever get to COCOBOLA or COCOBOLO.  POCO appears to be correct.
>Ross: ELO 15A .LEO +5 334
#note catch a huge break here not getting hit at O1 with a word with an I in it.
>Jeremy: ?ACLNRU 15M ARC +22 352
#note how to play this?  I go for both points and turnover.  Going out first in two more turns seems key.   Going for a bingo isn't going to happen.  Quack say 2J UT at 63.75% wpct, valuation of 15.9.  My play is just 33.44% and -0.6 valuation. (-16.5 Many ply)
>Ross: AIS O1 AIS +35 369
>Jeremy: ??LMNU 10A LUMs +20 372
#note N6 UL(N)a is best.  We figured out 10B UMp would win setting up NiL / LUMp next.  I didn't spot Ross' best play, and this cost me the game.  I think I had 0:50 on the clock when I settled on this.  Completely whiffed on thinking of pUGH.
>Ross: EEOU 9K .E.O. +16 385
#note That's a nice play.  Wish I had spotted it.
>Jeremy: ?N G13 .iN +6 378
#note E11 (REI)Ns is 8 points, but not enough.  -2.  I didn't want to do a recount after this (just a club game, not worth the effort).  Ross is the most accurate scorer at the club, and he usually catches mistakes.
>Jeremy:  (EU) +4 382
