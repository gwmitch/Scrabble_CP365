#note Just trying to open things up so he'll score very little while shutting it down. And if he DOESN'T shut it down, I'll prolly just bingo.

#note I have the L and the blank, I made this play to force him to burn his S to block my assumed 30+ pt play.

#note Hello Mr. S

#note Ugh. RACkFUL. I looked for -ful, but didn't even think about that. This won in all scenarios I played out and I didn't want to try anything else overly flashy for fear of me doing something stupid. Not at all a perfect endgame, but with a mix of me not being totally stupid and me bing fairly lucky I was able to pull it out.
