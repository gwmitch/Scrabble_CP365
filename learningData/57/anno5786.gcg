#note Duck prefers keeping ABLE on the exchange. I know it's a good combo, but I prefer a couple more tiles turned over.

#note Jeff, who played WoADWAX against me in our session last Sunday: "I always seem to find low-prob bingos against you." Me: "Please stop." :)
>Jason: BEGIINV E3 VIB. +18 81
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DIMNORT C3 MIN. +26 178
#note Fortunate to block Jeff's bongo.
>Jason: AEGILNO H1 AGON +24 105
#note Fishing into LINAGE on this board just isn't doing it for me. Disagree with Speedy here.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DOR I1 ROD +18 196
#note Jeff played ADO at F9 before realizing the DA# two. "No Collins," I warned. :)
>Jason: EIIKLUW F10 KIWI +37 142
#note The spot stays open, and a crappy IKUW draw is made more palatable.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AQT E11 QAT +53 249
#note Scratch that last comment. :)
>Jason: AEILNSU N3 INULASE +71 213
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EILNOV B1 VIOL +20 269
#note The double-double through the O would've been a shoo-in for best ORTONVILLE word. Jeff took a long time here and starts to get in time trouble.
>Jason: CEFOSTY H10 FOY +23 236
#note Missing the double-double through the O.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: Y 12D Y.. +18 287
#note Jeff took a long time on this turn, too, but didn't give me his rack after the game. So by now I'm sure he has at least one blank.
>Jason: CEEJRST O9 REJECTS +103 339
#note That looks like momentum walking over to my side of the table...
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EGP I11 PEG +17 304
>Jason: AEMRRUU 1A U.EA +24 363
#note Now it's interesting. I'd guess Jeff is at about two minutes, maybe 2:15-ish at this point. FOY and REJECTS were almost insta-played while he's taken a while the past three turns. I considered something like ARM(O)UR or RUM(O)UR with plans to kill the bingo line to the S next turn if he missed, but in the end, decided to score and maybe outrun the bingo. The leave's bad, but lots of A's and E's to draw in a slightly vowel-heavy bag.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?DENNOT 15H cONTEND. +77 381
#note Now he's down to about a minute. Obviously the 10 points could prove costly if he goes over.
>Jason: DHMRRSU M3 HUM +32 395
#note Played very fast. Seems best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AACEIOR L2 CARE +29 410
#note In time trouble, he misses the five in this spot that could've been really bad for me.
>Jason: ADFIRRS K10 ADRIF. +20 415
#note I screw up twice here (three times, if you count over-scoring this by two). The play itself is lousy (CP likes a FIARS-type play at 14A, but I'm more concerned with the fact that it took five-plus minutes to play. I mean, I look five minutes, try to figure out a winning sequence, go for the out in two ... I'm setting up the Z but hoping in his haste he'll miss the spot if he's got it, which is probably stupid. Given that the blank is out, he's probably got it and will probably see it. I finished with like 12 minutes ... do I take ten minutes on this play? Or recognize that my pre-endgame just sucks and play bad quickly?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?ABEEIO O1 BIsE +29 439
#note Jeff has a lot of wins here, and this is one. However, I didn't stop to think; the leave-inference part of my brain shuts off in the endgame. That he blocked that spot means he must think I have a vowel. I assume he's caught up on his tracking while I diddled around before ADRIFT.
>Jason: PRSTZ 10J Z.P +34 449
#note A play like PAR or PARS loses under optimal play; Jeff plays O(AR) to block TZ(AR) and Z-sticks me. But with Jeff at like 15 seconds, can I assume sub-optimal play? Regardless, I didn't see Jeff's win here and thought I was fine; must block ODEA (I whiffed on AEON ... ZAPS loses by one post-recount), must score with the Z, must leave guaranteed out (GRITS, ORTS). Easy game, 3-1, woot, etc. But if I see Jeff's win, what do I do? Get fancy?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEO J7 A.O.E +22 461
#note Now it was my turn to break the NASPA Code of Conduct. Hats off to Jeff for a great play under time pressure, not getting rattled with the clock ticking and momentum on my side post-REJECTS. He definitely deserved second.
