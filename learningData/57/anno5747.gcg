>April_McCarley: BOOT 8E BOOT +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: CEGMNST G7 M.C +13 13
#note This choice sims 3rd, taking a hit of approximately 3 equity points.  But this choice sure worked out well given my next draw.
>April_McCarley: ILLMNRV -ILLMNR +0 12
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGJNST 10E JESTiNG +76 89
#note Best placement; the I6 placement is a 5-point dog in the sim.
>April_McCarley: TW I9 W.T +9 21
>Jim_Burlant: ADIILVY E10 .IVY +34 123
#note Best. TIDILY H10 also worth consideration.  
>April_McCarley: CEIT 12C CI.ET +20 41
>Jim_Burlant: ADIILUZ K10 .UID +12 135
#note C10 LUCID wins the sim, with my choice taking a hit of not even 2 points in the sim. Pretty much a matter of stylistic preference more than being a clear-cut case of being a good play as opposed to a bad play.
>April_McCarley: DU 13I DU. +7 48
#note I have to admit, this play puzzled me; I thought she should have played at 13K to open up, not 13I.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNZ C9 LAN.ED +20 155
#note Wasn't sure if ZINCED was good so I figured I'd try to set up the Z for the next turn.  Not even one of the original choices, this beats out all of Quackle's suggestions (except ZINCED) in the sim, though it understandably coughs up huge equity (roughly 21 pts) to ZINCED.
>April_McCarley: ILOP H4 PILO. +14 62
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEIQZ B10 ZA +64 219
#note Not surprising that this wins the sim, but what's interesting is that it's just barely best, also giving strong consideration to QI I3 or 14A QADI, the latter of which I don't quite understand.  
>April_McCarley: UX 6H .UX +26 88
>Jim_Burlant: EEEHIQY I3 QI +25 244
#note Highest valuation play but K4 EYE wins the sim by win-percentage by a few hundredths of a percentage point.  I'm at 98% winning chances.
>April_McCarley: ERTT 4H ..TTER +16 104
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEHOY K4 .OEA +19 263
#note I held her last play of PITTER*, but given this rack I let it go because I felt taht 19 points for this play still added 3 to my lead, and it sure beat exchanging.  Quackle rates this as the second best choice, losing by a statistically insignificant amount to 3K EYE.   Given this lead I'd just rather clear the vowel overload and worry about scoring next turn.
>April_McCarley: GRU E5 GRU. +14 118
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGHOY B13 HEY +29 292
#note Urp, bad miss of 14J plays, with 14J HEDGY 62 winning the sim.  Fortunately the lead is so great here that this game is almost over but for the final score.  Still a bad miss though.
>April_McCarley: MO A14 MO +33 151
>Jim_Burlant: ADEGLOV M1 OVE.GLAD +78 370
#note Was considering VEG 1I when I then noticed the R at M4.  Wasn't entirely sure this was good, but figured that I could afford to risk losing a turn if it wasn't.
>April_McCarley: AFIKRRW -  +0 151
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: ?BENORS N7 SORBENt +69 439
#note Gotta know the bingo's to play them.  Interestingly, outside of the 3x3's that I didn't know, Quackle says my best options are a bunch of 4's
>April_McCarley: FHO 1L H.OF +42 193
>Jim_Burlant: AEIKNSW 2J KNA.E +53 492
#note Just goes to show it's easier to play with good tiles than bad tiles.  It's not like this is a bad play or anything, but WANKS O4 scores 67, and I'll very possibly have a play on row 2 for 25 or 30 points next turn.  Probably costing myself 20 or 30 points of spread here.
