#note Given the inference that Brian is close toa bingo, I forego playing for equity here.  The idea is to either force him to find an 8 to/from/through the M and/or O...and if he has a 7 it is going to have to give me something back at one of the triple-words.
>Brian_Raines: ADEEINS I5 ANISEED +65 65
#note He makes a subtle mistake with this placement, costing himself 4 points.  Additionally, it gave me more points when I bingo'd back.  Quackle's preference was the 9E placement.
>Jim_Burlant: AELMNRT 7D TRAML.NE +74 82
#note Best. 47 - 48% winning chances.  Incorrectly scored as 75.
>Brian_Raines: IV K5 VI. +12 77
>Jim_Burlant: EGILOPW 11G WO.GE +20 102
#note No real standout plays here.  Sim winner is 11D PLOWE(D), with this choice taking a 2-point hit in the sim. 
>Brian_Raines: ?NRZ D4 NeR.Z +46 123
>Jim_Burlant: IILOPRT 8A RIT. +39 141
#note Since he burned the blank this cheaply, I'm running sims against an inferred blank until otherwise noted.  This is best, nothing else comes close.  
>Brian_Raines: EFHIOPY -EFHI +0 123
#note A random rack, I have no idea what his actual rack was.
>Jim_Burlant: CEILOOP 12B POLICE +25 166
#note Much better if I play at H10, which I missed.  This cohice takes a 4-point hit in the sim, probably due to the leave of O as opposed to OO.  Still, I should have been looking for the 10H play.
>Brian_Raines: NTY E11 T.NY +14 137
>Jim_Burlant: EILOSTY B12 .OLY +18 184
#note Yuck.  Sim winners are 13-C YIN and YON - not sure why I missed those.
>Brian_Raines: AA A14 AA +23 160
#note Incorrectly scored as 20.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEISST 13G DESISTs +79 263
#note Shocked when I saw the blank in my rack - I couldn't believe he had burned his blank for 46 when he had the much safer ZA for 31 a few turns ago. Anyway, pretty easy choices here.  This sims marginally better with the blank at 13K rather than the dw.  REally?
>Brian_Raines: DIN 14H DIN +15 175
>Jim_Burlant: EOOOPRW C3 WOO +15 278
#note Geeez...blind to 8K plays again.  8K WOOER is much much better than THIS.  Bleah.
>Brian_Raines: HU 15G UH +36 211
>Jim_Burlant: BDEOPRX C11 P.X +42 320
#note Knew that last play with the H was coming.
>Brian_Raines: EGQSTUU -EGQ +0 211
>Jim_Burlant: BDEEKOR A3 BROKE.ED +66 386
#note Amazing how poor my board vision can be yet I can see this in a split second.   I confound myself.
>Brian_Raines: AEIINRT M6 INERTIA. +59 270
>Jim_Burlant: AFGLOTU 8L F.AL +33 419
#note Not the best play, but this had an unexpected benefit...
>Brian_Raines: AABFGUU -  +0 270
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGOTU O7 A.E +3 422
#note Non-existent board vision strikes, explaining why I missed D11 OLEA and practically any of the star plays.  This is beyond weak.  I didn't want to dump my U because of the unseen Q, and I went way overboard trying to hold onto it. Fortunately for me this game is over except for the final score, so I'm sacrificing spread. 
>Brian_Raines: AFGHU H1 FAUGH +47 317
>Jim_Burlant: GUU 1H .UG +7 429
#note I did not write this rack down and only recalled that, once again, I was making sure that I had the U in case I drew the Q. 
>Brian_Raines: ABQS 3F SQ.AB +27 344
>Jim_Burlant: EEIOTUV 2J OUTVIE +30 459
#note Well, I've woken up from my nap now.  This is clearly best.  
>Brian_Raines: CJR O1 R.C +15 359
>Jim_Burlant: E 14E .E +7 466
>Jim_Burlant:  (J) +16 482
#note Final score recorded as 484 - 356.
