#note bingo miss 1. AUtO(C)OId.  bizarrely my play is only 1% win worse.  AUTOCOID is closely related to AUTACOID. i shouldn't miss the hormone bingos.

#note don't know why i knew PALESTRA took an E back hook. Probably because i'd seen PALESTRA so much due to constantly missing APTERAL+S in study.  Anyhow, 11c FOE is probably better.

#note bingo miss 2. 15a HANDWrI(T) - didn't know it. my play is 2nd, but drops in the sim. h2 WHIN is better as is 3b WH(OP), 3i WA(GO)N or m1 WHA.  Even h1 WAHINe is better (which i considered). Though my play is only 3% win back (67%).
