>Jim_Burlant: AAACNOR 8F ANOA +8 8
#note This position is essentially a matter of style preference more than right/wrong; this choice loses fewer than 2 points to 8G ARCANA (which I didn't know) and exchange AA.
>Nancee_Mancel: EKL 7D LEK +13 13
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGGMR E3 GRAC. +16 24
#note Quackle's top choice is I7 GAG, which I felt gave up too much for a decent, but not incredibly potent, combinatoin.  Had I played that, however, this game would have taken a much different course.  This play gets slammed by the sim.  Not sure why I didn't look for 8A MEGA, which again would have drastically altered the course this game took.
>Nancee_Mancel: BDEE 9F BEDE +27 40
>Jim_Burlant: BEGIMNT 4D B.IM +16 40
#note  Nancee was the only player to get a phony past me this tournament...and she's done it again.  I held this...but couldn't bring myself to challenge it...and this play really caused me much trouble later in this gtame.  Anyway:  to this position.  Didn't know most of the choices and didn't want to part with my E.  This takes a pounding in the sim for obvious reasons...
>Nancee_Mancel: JSTU H1 JUTS +46 86
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEGINT 3H .wEETING +66 106
#note Mild equity hit here for this cohice; EJECTING 1G wins the sim...but if I had known how the rest of the game would progress, WEETING J9 would not have been a bad choice and it would have saved me lots of grief.
>Nancee_Mancel: LUU 2L ULU +14 100
>Jim_Burlant: EIIORRS O3 .IRO +6 112
#note Surprised I don't take a much bigger hit for this play, which is really terrible.  But again, hindsight is 20/20.  If I had known just how defensively she was going to play I never would have done this and I would have dumped the rack woth GORIER.  This is another choice that comes back to haunt me.  
>Nancee_Mancel: AY N5 AY +28 128
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIRRS 7M RE +9 121
#note I realized by now that BEDE* was phony, and I was pretty sure she knew that too, so I didn't take the chance on BEDE*/SERRIED.  Since she was obviously starting to play the shutdown game I felt it more important to open up a new line...surely she can't shut this down that easly, can she?
>Nancee_Mancel: CEEX L5 EXEC +19 147
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIIRT K3 .IDE +25 146
#note Given that I didn't know DIAERETIC (honestly, how many of us under 1900 wouold find that?) this was all I could come up with.  Turns out this is the best play, beating out the bingo.
>Nancee_Mancel: ANOZ 8A ZONA +45 192
>Jim_Burlant: ?FIMRRS B7 F.RM +15 161
#note Gotta know the bingo to play it .  Forgive me for not knowing the 19800 probability URSIFORM.  Now I'm in trouble.  Quackle prefers fishing off one of the R's with REX - I'd rather draw 3 to SIR? and hope to hook form with my S on the next turn. 
>Nancee_Mancel: AQU 3B QUA. +32 224
>Jim_Burlant: ?DINRRS G8 ..RD +5 166
#note By this point I'm starting to get concerned - if I'm sitting on SIR?, how hard should it be to draw into a playable bingo for crying out loud?  Again, I felt I had to simply pepper the board with open lines and hope.  Quackle prefers 6J REX and J6 DIS to this.  
>Nancee_Mancel: LLOST 12C TOLLS +16 240
>Jim_Burlant: ?INOORS A8 .OO +18 184
#note Now I'm seriously on the verge of completely unraveling.  Not only is she drawing into plays I've been looking for (since the MEGA whiff I'd been looking for an 8A play but never had one), and not only is she successfully killing the board, but it is steaming me to watch her use her S and X to not even try to score, and this has me so rattled I missed the only playable bingo, (D)IShONOR (not necessarily an expert-level find but definitely not a trivial find).  The bingo only has 25% winning chances and this play comes in at just under 21.  This game is rapidly slipping away from me.
>Nancee_Mancel: AOV J5 OVA +39 279
>Jim_Burlant: ?EINNRS J9 SINNERs +68 252
#note And now I make the fateful play.  I don't recognize the legitimate backhook to BEDE but put this down out of desperatoin, as I only have 10% winning chances anyway.  I thought that maybe  BEDE* was good because Nancee didn't even so much as hold me...though her next rack may have had something to do with that...  Learniing point:  Quackle says the best play here is NE 11A 25, bypassing the bingo.  Can I really afford to wait any longer to put this down?
>Nancee_Mancel: ADIOSVW 15H DI.AVOWS +212 491
#note  I just could not believe this was happening and was too stunned to continue annotating - suffice it to say I just moved tiles as quickly as I could to end this fiasco as quickly as possible.  Final score recorded as 307 - 533.  OUCH!!!!
