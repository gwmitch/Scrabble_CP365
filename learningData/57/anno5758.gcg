#note Tweakish - 5g F(ER)RIC, d10 F(A)RCI, C(A)LIF or 12C FLIR all a bit better.  i didn't mind my play holding the L for OIL and hoping to draw an O for f10 JO. maybe too cute.

#note i played this as i couldnt find any plan B. I knew it took an S back hook too. One of those situations where i think 'maybe i'll be lucky', rather than thinking more.  Q likes fishing off the G or playing thru the N at L5 with ANERGIC, CARING, CERING, LACING, GALENIC.  Maybe even 14b CIGARET?

#note didnt see an 8 from the W or to the T, but figured one to the T was more likely - so i blocked with this.  There are 2 possibles from the unseen pool - BUSHGOAT & OGHAMIST. Turns out i blocked the latter.
