>Verbie: DEFGIII H7 FIG +14 14
#note -10 to FIDGE, which I had not known
>sonofaulay: DEOOORY -DEOOO +0 0
>Verbie: DEIILOR G6 OIL +12 26
#note Keeping the L (with just OI) is +.7 to this.  Defence likely a key factor (fewer hooks)
>sonofaulay: AIOPTU 5F UTOPIA +20 20
>Verbie: DEEIKRX 4D KEX +37 63
#note obvious.
>sonofaulay: BCELU D1 BUC.LE +17 37
>Verbie: ADEIIRU 1D .URIED +27 90
#note Should have seen DAUBIER, might not have realized it's even more than +3 to this (+8 in fact)
>sonofaulay: Q J4 Q. +11 48
>Verbie: AAAINOW C6 AWA +12 102
#note Immediate punishment for not dropping the A.  Why did I not see the C5 placement? (-2)
>sonofaulay: EFT 8A FE.T +24 72
>Verbie: ACDINOS 2H DOC +18 120
#note -12 to 4J QAID.  Relieved there aren't any bingos here though.

>Verbie: AEHIINS 3C I.H +21 141
#note It's what had to go.  
>sonofaulay: EO 9G E.O +12 105
>Verbie: AEGINSS 6J SAG +22 163
#note -9 to KEXES!  I'd rather keep the E though.
>sonofaulay: EI L6 .IE +5 110
>Verbie: EIMNRST 10B MINTERS +81 244
#note best spot.
>sonofaulay: ADEINST M8 DETAINS +71 181
#note At this score, G needs to open up space.  That's why this instead of the very stylish (and 16-extra-points) 11A.
>Verbie: BEENOPT L12 POET +26 270
#note Tried too hard to keep an E.  BEEP scores 8 more, and the plus to value is 8.4 by Q's figuring.
>sonofaulay: RTY B2 TRY +21 202
>Verbie: BELNORU 15H BURN. +21 291
#note Weak.  -8.5 to UNBOLT leaving ER vs ELO in my play.
>sonofaulay: EMOV K8 MOVE +24 226
>Verbie: EHLNORS 11E OH +19 310
#note -4 to the very cute HON(GIE)S L3.  A slew of plays at N9 starting with H are in between.
>sonofaulay: AIJOR M2 RIOJA +29 255
>Verbie: ?ELNRSV H12 VER. +13 323
#note -4.5 to VOLE 4L.
>sonofaulay: ANYZ 12B ZANY +38 293
>Verbie: ?AELLNS 13A LANES +34 357
#note Stylishness goes with LANcES N9 for 1 more (giving away an out play though)
>sonofaulay: ?DNW N1 WeND +21 314
#note Had I done the mass-overlap last, this would be at O6 for 25.  So just as well.
