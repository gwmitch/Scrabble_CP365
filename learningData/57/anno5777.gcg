>Chris_Cree: AAJLP 7H JALAP +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: ADENRSU M4 DANSEUR +76 94
#note Quackle prefers M6 ASUNDER and L2 UNDRAPES by a hair.  Incorrectly scored as 75.
>Chris_Cree: DEY 9F DEY +27 57
>Jim_Burlant: IIOPUYZ 4I PYOI. +22 116
#note Urp.  Too fixated on clearing out the garbage to look for the best play.  Way too many scoreboard points given up here.  ZIP L3 is best (didn't occur to me to play the Z) with L5 PIPY (which didn't occur to me) coming in a close second.
>Chris_Cree: CEITW 5E TWICE +24 81
>Jim_Burlant: IIMOUUZ -IIOUU +0 116
#note Quackle prefers 6K MUNI, and the rest of the options are exchanges.  I didn't see MUNI.  Despite Quackle's opposition to this particular exchange I elected to keep MZ since they're both positive tiles I and I figured I'd be able to come up with a nice-scoring play with them on the next turn.
>Chris_Cree: EEEKLRS 10A SLEEKER +76 157
>Jim_Burlant: AILMSTZ A7 ZIT. +39 155
#note Best, beating D6 MAZIEST and A8 ZAS.  Really?  I didn't choose this because I thought it was best; poor board vision struck again and I thought the position was a tossup between this and ZAS A8.  Duck says I'm at 45% winning chances with this play.
>Chris_Cree: AQT B6 QAT +45 202
#note Ouch - if I'd seen the allegedly "wrong" play of MAZIEST on the previous turn, the sequence would have been 56 - 39 instead of 39 - 45.  Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: AGLMNSU 8M .MU +15 170
#note Nothing really stands out here, with the top 10 choices simming w/in 4.5 points of each other.   I felt it best to open up the O column  and ditch the U.    Quackle prefers  L10 ALGUM  L10 ALMUG, or 11D MAN.  This play is roughly a 3-point dog in the sim.
>Chris_Cree: AAFIM 4A MAFIA +28 230
>Jim_Burlant: AGLNSTV A1 GLA. +21 191
#note This is the major miss.  For some reason my board vision was non-existent and  I was too fixated playing at A1.  Terrible.  The other mistakes to this point  have been recoverable and a case could be made that my not playing the Z when I played PYOID came out in the wash after he bingo'd.  But this blunder really costs me for reasons you will see soon enough. The clear winners are 11D LAV or TAV, which there is absolutely no excuse for me missing.
>Chris_Cree: HOO 3C OHO +30 260
>Jim_Burlant: GGLNOSV L9 NOGG +16 207
#note Quackle prefers C9 LEGONG (which I didn't know) and C9 VEG to this choice.  I felt it important to turn as much of the rack as I could; I'm at 10% winning chances now.
>Chris_Cree: BIN 11D NIB +30 290
>Jim_Burlant: ?ENOSTV D9 V..T +14 221
#note This is where I pay for missing TAV or LAV a few turns back.  Had I made the proper play on that turn, the V would no longer be rendering the bingo that I need unplayable. Instead I have to waste another turn scoring only 14 points.  This is the best choice according to the sim.
>Chris_Cree: UV 11J VU. +14 304
>Jim_Burlant: ?DELNOS O8 .NSOLvED +77 298
#note One of the two best plays, the other being UNSOLDEr in the same location.  Roughly 33% winning chances.   For reference, I had replayed the game with the same draws had I found TAV a few turns back; the bingo I would have drawn would have had me at 42% winning chances and I'd be tied now (or have a slight lead) instead of being down 6 with him having a turn - a huge difference.  
>Chris_Cree: EO M12 OE +7 311
>Jim_Burlant: ABENRRR L3 R.B +9 307
#note Auackle prefers 2E BARREN, keeping R, presumably for turnover to get at the blank.  If there was somewhere safe for me to play off BRR I'd have done that.  Because of the S hook I coudln't hit at 13D and that unseen blank, I felt I should just open up another line since I didn't like my chances and I didn't have a good block.   BARREN ostensibly wins 42%, but given his next rack I think it's safe to say that my winning chances are zero.
>Chris_Cree: DEEINRS 13B RESINED +76 387
#note Chris is now at 85% winning chances.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINRX 14A REX +33 340
#note I prefer this play, as it takes the bag down to 1.  Quackle prefers RADIX H11.
>Chris_Cree: ?EIIOTU 2L cUTE +11 398
#note Chris took about 5 minutes on this turn and he told me after the game that the A was the last tile in the bag, as he was trying to make sure he had a bullet-proof block for a potential bingo of ANTICAR.
