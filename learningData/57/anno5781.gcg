>Jim_Burlant: AEMOSTY 9H YOM +17 17
#note Gotta know the bingo to play it, and I had never seen ATEMOYAS.  As far as the non-bingo options go, this play is rather questionable.  I didn't need to run the sim to know how bad it was.  Why?  While it leaves a dynamite combination, it nullifies the positional advantage I have from possessing the S because YOM doesn't take a back S.  The best non-bingo play is (depending on stylistic preference) MOSEY J6 37 or 9H YO 14.  But this choice was stupid.
>Marty_Gabriel: EHORSTU 10C SOUTHER +71 95
#note Marty makes a bit of an error here, as he sacrifices 8 points by using this placement instead of the 10H placement.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGSTW 11I AWE +16 33
#note Gotta know the bingo to play it.  I was looking for the T for WATTAGES, but didn't know WASTAGES (and would not have tried it if I had seen it, thinking it would have been a made-up word ending in AGE).   I'm just trying to open a line for my S here since I short-changed myself by playing YOM earlier.  This is why I'm playing off the E instead of the second A.
>Marty_Gabriel: BFU 12K FUB +21 116
>Jim_Burlant: ACGSTUZ C10 .CUT +12 45
#note Sim winner is C7 ZAGS 26, which didn't occur to me at any time though it does make sense, as it does a nice job opening the northwest quadrant.  The first play I saw was ZAS N10 but wasn't happy about the CGUT leave.  So I looked for the better play and spent a couple of minutes trying to remember whether I had ever seen SCUZ* as a 4.  Discretion was the better part of valor so I passed on that, and was so fixated on dumping the U that this was what I came up with.  This play sims equally to ZAS N10; I'm truthfully surprised this play doesn't cough up 25 equity, I thought it was horrendous.
>Marty_Gabriel: GNOP D12 PONG +28 144
>Jim_Burlant: AGOOSTZ 15D .AZOO +45 90
#note About the only good play I make for the next 3 turns, this is the obvious winner simming at 20% winning chances.
>Marty_Gabriel: ABCDE M9 CAB.ED +32 176
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEGST F12 GEE. +16 106
#note Didn't know the first choice of N10 GESTE.  Thought about 8M SEG 26 to open up since it was clear he was doing an excellent job of scoring and controlling the board but this is where the cumulative effect of the day's events were starting to catch up to me.  Because of all the swill I drew during the Reeves game and I had a couple of ill-timed bad draws against Cree in the previous round, I thought SEG could wait one turn while I cleaned out the rack; he seemed to be hesitating when he put down CABBED on the prevoius turn.  This choice actually sims in the top 3 or 4, but at a huge (12 points) loss of equity to N10 GESTE.
>Marty_Gabriel: KSU 8M SUK +35 211
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEGST O6 DE.E +9 115
#note So much for my intuition; he did have the S and now I'm in real trouble. Since I don't know any of the scoring plays (didn't know GESTE) I have to open up.  EEK O6 woiuld be the best open given my rack, but can I afford to put the vowel at O6 and risk  giving him something like HEAVY for 57 points?  I was hardly thrilled, but given that I had to open up and that I didn't know any of the scoring plays, my options were pretty limited here.
>Marty_Gabriel: EHM N13 HEM +27 238
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGIRST 6M GI. +7 122
#note Damn - could have used one of those Es that had clogged my rack for a few turns, as I would have had ERGoTIS(M).  ANyway - I didn't know most of the choices and it didn't occur to me to play AGISM for 25.   Terribly weak. FUBAR 12K 20 is probably the one option I should have seen...but I was seriously brain locking by now.  This game wasn't just going badly; this was going horrendously.  I'm down to 5% winning chances here.
>Marty_Gabriel: ADINORT -ADINOR +0 238
#note This is a random quackle rack; I have no idea what Marty's rack was.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAIRST 5G ASTeRIA +65 187
#note Didn't know most of the choices.  I'm up to 10% winning chances now.  My joy at being almost back in the game was tempered when I saw my next rack.
>Marty_Gabriel: IX N10 XI +54 292
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: DFJRSVW -DFVW +0 187
#note Yuck.  Normally I'd toss the J but thought that I might be able to score with it if the exchange left me something that wasn't bingo prone.
>Marty_Gabriel: AAIR 4L ARIA +18 310
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIJRS 6A JERrIDS +72 259
#note That certainly worked out well, didn't it?  An interesting option is 6B JERIDS 36, bypassing the bingo and keeping the blank.  Makes sense in theory - but given how late it is, can I afford to pass up the bingo?  I think I have to put the bingo down and simnply hope he's drawn to a rack of iiioooV or some such hideousness.  
>Marty_Gabriel: DEIV A6 .IVED +48 358
#note Just when I thought I had some chance in this game, I'm redead.
>Jim_Burlant: AILLNNO E4 NO.L +8 267
#note At this point I've checked out of the game and am just moving tiles to end it as quickhly as possible, which means I explode the deficit further.  When I saw this rack I knew the game was pretty much a done deal except for the final score.

#note Annotation stopped at this point - final score 305 - 440.  Don't know how I even managed to top 300 in this one.
