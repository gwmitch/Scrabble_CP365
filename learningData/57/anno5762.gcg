>james: AEEIQSU 11B QUEE. +34 223
#note worse than d4 EQUI(P), 4b QUEA(N) or EQUI(N)E.  tho i wanted to keep those lanes possibly open for 8s

>james: AEEIOSW E5 OW +21 244
#note very close in the sim between this or 6a OWE/WOE/WAE or 6b WO. all of those are too spicy for me, tho i didn't like blocking 8s thru the N or D

#note f13 I(C)Y is liked, or fishing of AY/YA at 6b,c3,13d.  i like the EVIS leave of my play.

#note maybe O8 FER, FEH. tho i like keeping the E, but maybe 16 points is too many to not take.
>champ: EILOOSZ 5K OLI.E +16 343
#note i think this is a horible play, so i re-simmed it and it does come out way ahead - 28% win, next best is 21% b2 OS. Personally, i quite like 6b LO for quackle here.
>james: ACEFHRR O1 CHAF. +51 423
#note i think the risk of something like this was too big for Quackle to play OLIVE.
