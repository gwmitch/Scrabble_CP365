#note The other option is HULA. I thought I'd go with the more bingo-prone leave, since there are strong bingo tiles out there and I might hit something soon.

>Evans_Clinchy: EILNRTU B11 .UNT. +24 222
#note This doesn't do anything to open bingo lanes, but what am I gonna do? UN J2? No thanks...

#note Woohoo! I get a bingo in the one bingo lane available, and it takes no hooks! I win, right?
>Dave_Leifer: ?ELOORS 12I LOOkERS +70 369
#note Oh. Wrong.
>Evans_Clinchy: FGNTTUW O8 TUFT. +24 361
#note I have no bloody clue how TUNG 14K is supposed to win 8.33 percent of the time. You've stumped me yet again, Quackle...
>Dave_Leifer: ACDKLNO M7 CLOAK.D +36 405
#note Yeah, that'll do it.
>Evans_Clinchy: CDEGNOW K11 W..N +14 375
#note My sleep-deprived, low-on-time logic was that the best endgame sequence had to involve blocking BORN K11. Never mind that DOWNED 1J scores about a trillion points, or that he has another outplay anyway...
>Dave_Leifer: BN I11 B..N +6 411
#note ...yeah, that one. Not that it really matters in the end. This was Dave's win.
