#note Actually sims high!
>Them: EORSTTU H4 TOUTERS +66 66
#note Now I know OUTSERT; I figured you'd have played STOUTER if you didn't know this was good. Oh, and you cheated yourself out of 2 points.
>Me: BQTTUUW 4D BUTU. +14 14
#note Gee, maybe I should have kept a U. Or better yet, 10H (S)UQ.
>Them: AIN 5C AIN +14 80
>Me: EEKQSTW B2 WEEK +30 44
#note Strange, quackle actually considers burning the S with WEEKS for 6 more points. 
>Them: CEILNRS 8B RECLIN.S +63 143
#note LICENSER and SILENCER also fit, but are less defensive.
>Me: ACOQRST F2 QA. +32 76
#note I'd have played QATS if I'd known I was going to get another S...
>Them: ADMN A1 DAMN +36 179
#note DAMN, I'm down by a hundred points!
>Me: CORSSTY F2 ...S +22 98
#note COY sims high, but I don't like RSST for a leave. Missed COSY or ROSY at I2.
>Them: EIVV 10D VIVE. +19 198
#note Hopefully I'll remember that this isn't good from now on.
>Me: CGORSTY 7A COY +23 121
#note Q likes GOY with the CRST leave slightly better.
>Them: AG C2 AG +24 222
>Me: FGLRSTU 6G G.LF +16 137
#note Best way to score a little and try for a better rack.
>Them: BDDEOOT -BDDEO +0 222
>Me: DRRRSTU -DRRRU +0 137
#note If I had know DURRS for sure, I'd have played it. Best exchange is DRRU, but I'm tired of having consonant heavy racks.... I also almost played TURDS but then I'd be closing the only bingo lane and using the last S.
>Them: AH 9B AH +25 247
>Me: DEEOOST D10 .OE +12 149
#note Trying to make the board more open, hoping to make something happen. Top sim.
>Them: NOZ 11B ZO.N +30 277
>Me: ADENOST 12D .NDOSTEA +63 212
#note Glad I found this! Wish I remembered it takes an L, not that it ended up mattering. Holy crap, though, I overscored it as 79! Oops.
>Them: NOO B11 .OON +26 303
>Me: BDDEIPT 11K BIPED +28 240
#note Trying to keep it open and score the most. Also top sim.
>Them: ?AEEILM O4 rEMAILE. +80 383
#note I won't question REMAILED/REMEDIAL again.
>Me: AADJRTW A13 JAW +50 290

>Me: ADFGIRT 13J FRIG +26 316
#note GID or GAD at C13 score better, but this worked out..
>Them: Y 13A ..Y +26 431
>Me: ADEORTT 14F ROTATED +79 395
>Them: IIILPRR 15G PI +22 453
>Me: ?EH N6 Ha +28 423
#note I thought of EdH N4 on the car ride home. It would've caused a tie score with our incorrect scoring. I probably would have offered to quackle it and send you any discrepancies though.
>Them: IILRR 7F LI. +11 464
>Me: E 7F ...E +9 432
#note Great game! I'll have to consider making it close after a 143 point deficit to be a moral victory.
