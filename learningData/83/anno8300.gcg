>Jim_Burlant: ?AEFLSU 8H EASeFUL +76 76
#note Any number of bingos - 8B rEFUSAL or 8D FErULAS - are just as good in the sim. But this had unanticipated benefits.
>Tracy_Bowman: QT -  +0 0
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AABEMNO K5 AMO.BEAN +94 170
#note Can't ask for a much better start!  Tracy hasn't even laid down a tile and she's down 170 - 0 and her winning chances are already 3%.
>Tracy_Bowman: AEHNPQT I7 Q.T +23 23
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEIIR L8 .ERIAE +30 200
#note My favorite play this game.  This was held, but released.
>Tracy_Bowman: HPT M12 PHT +31 54
>Jim_Burlant: AABDIOX N5 AXI. +27 227
#note Knew BIAXIAL, but not BIAXAL.  BIAXAL is a little better.
>Tracy_Bowman: ADIMT O1 ADMIT +29 83
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEEOW M3 WOE +15 242
#note I wasn't sure WOAD could be extended with ED, so I passed up WOADED 2J, which is the sim winner.   I started to clamp down on the defense because, if she didn't have a bingo ending in S this board could shut down very quickly.  From this point on, I force her to open.  However, her almost total lack of vowels makes it impossible for her to do so, which turns this into a real slog.
>Tracy_Bowman: PRY 10J P..RY +24 107
#note While it's not Tracy's fault she can't land any vowels, this was the second big mistake she made this game (the first being her challenging EASEFUL).   Given what this play did to the board, it would have had to score a lot more than 23 points to justify making it.  While PRY J3 only scores 13, it would be virtually impossible for me to defend, and it would still leave the potential S hook on QAT alive (if she had an S).  And it would force me to have to keep playing.
>Jim_Burlant: AABCDEO L2 BAD +23 265
#note Predictably, Q says I should play L1 BEAD.  Pffft.  Like I said, make her open up.  Why should I give her an E to bingo up to?
>Tracy_Bowman: DELL J2 DELL +11 118
>Jim_Burlant: AACENOU H8 .AU +5 270
#note Believe it or not Quackle actually likes this.  If she's challenging EASEFUL it's doubtful she knows any of the low-probability bingos that would play to the U on row 10, so now I only have rows 2 - 4 to defend, unless she opens up a hook by playing something at 9G.  And, worst case, even if she manages to hit something at G9 (not the easiest thing for her given the pool), it will give me something back on row 15.
>Tracy_Bowman: FHILOUV -FHIL +0 118
#note Not sure exactly whether she tossed 3 or 4 into the bag, but I have this written as an exchange.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEHNO I3 HE +20 290
#note Q prefers that I leave rows 2, 3, and 4 open for bingos by playing HE N1.   I figured Q wouldn't like this much, but really - how badly can she hurt me if she doesn't have DISC in her rack?
>Tracy_Bowman: GIN H4 GIN +12 130
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEINO K1 OE +8 298
#note Q prefers AE N1.  While defense is the order of the day, I want to have the best rack possible in case she does manage to open up.  No way I'm burning the case A if I don't absolutely have to.  I can affort to sacrifice the 4 scoreboard points with this lead.
>Tracy_Bowman: EJ 10F JE. +26 156
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEINR 2N E. +6 304
#note No, Quackle, I'm not going to open the board up for her.  For some reason, Q says I should throw her a lifeline with G9 CEE.  Whatever, it's just theoretical equity at this point - everything wins just under 100% at this point.
>Tracy_Bowman: CNO 11E CON +21 177
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOR D7 RECOIN +24 328
#note Not interested in rack building, just trying to end this ASAP by turning as many tiles as I can. That said,  CORIA D8 would have been better, as it takes no back hooks.  I couldn't think of it.
>Tracy_Bowman: EFT 8A FET. +21 198
>Jim_Burlant: ADIIINU A8 .UNDI +10 338
#note Q says I should exchange.   And in a closer game where I had to worry about manufacturing another big play, I probably would.  But given my 130-point lead with this board, why prolong the game by exchanging?  I'd rather kil the A column, reduce B column opportunities, and make sure the bag is 4 tiles lighter.  No argument that the AII leave sucks, but with only 1 I in the remaining bag, it's not likely I'll get another one.  This isn't one of the original kibitzer choices but it sims respectably.  
>Tracy_Bowman: G F10 ..G +11 209
>Jim_Burlant: AGIIKRV B6 VI. +14 352
#note Q prefers J12 KIVA - pfft.  This is second best in the sim, but I'll take this play's defensive strength over KIVA's points any day.
