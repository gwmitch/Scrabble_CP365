>Joey_Mallick: AGILOPU 8D POILU +20 20
>Evans_Clinchy: AGIMOOZ E5 GAZ.O +30 30
#note Quackle likes the other GAZOO better. I liked going on the offensive with this placement and setting up OM.
>Joey_Mallick: AACFGNR D1 FANGA +29 49
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIMOOS 1B MA.IOSO +36 66
>Joey_Mallick: CDIJNRS 10B JINS +43 92
>Evans_Clinchy: DELLRRW A7 WELD +37 103
#note This is fine statically, but WILLER C9 sims considerably better. I can hold onto the D and look for a better play in this lane later.
>Joey_Mallick: ACCDEOR 7C CO. +21 113
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EFLRRR C9 R.FLER +20 123
#note Even though this gives me three letters to play through, and the LR synergy isn't great, FIRER is still better. Hmm, okay.
>Joey_Mallick: ACDEMOR 12B C.AMORED +78 191
>Evans_Clinchy: ??BHRTY H11 H.RBY +39 162
#note Awwww, bummer. There's only one bingo here, and it's ridiculous. Props if you see it.
>Joey_Mallick: AOTTTUX F4 TAX +55 246
#note It was B(U)TcH(E)RlY. That was the only freaking bingo.
>Evans_Clinchy: ??ARTUW 2H WRAUghT +75 237
#note The challenge grid just keeps getting worse.  At least I avoid the mental headache of doing defensive stuff to make bingo-ing harder for him.
>Joey_Mallick: EOQTTTU 13H .OQUET +36 282
>Evans_Clinchy: AEIINOS 2A OI +12 249
#note Sims best. I didn't even consider IONISE N9. That looks a little crazy.
>Joey_Mallick: BLNTTTU 12L BUTT +24 306
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIINS 14B I.E +6 255
#note You can stop watching now. Basically the next million turns consist of me dinking away vowels. This sims best, for what it's worth.
>Joey_Mallick: DEEGLNT 14L GELD +21 327
#note I didn't see DANEGELT J1, but blocking this lane seemed wise, based on the previous plays made.
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEHINS A13 AHI +25 280
#note Maybe just HA, to keep a slightly more bingo-prone leave.
>Joey_Mallick: EEENPTV O8 EVEN. +24 351
#note Joey was close to hitting the triple-triple EVENTIDE here, which woulda been pretty sweet.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEENNSV 3B DE. +14 294
#note Not sure why I did this. I think I was desperately grasping at bingos like UNNERVES and VAINNESS.
>Joey_Mallick: EIIPRST L2 .RIPIEST +70 421
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNNSV I4 AVENS +17 311
#note I've always wanted to play this word. It's not a good play. I don't care.
>Joey_Mallick: EIKY N6 KEY +25 446
>Evans_Clinchy: NN 7K N.N. +5 316
