>Jim_Burlant: AEIKOSW 8D AWOKE +26 26
#note Best, with the 8H placement simming  points down.
>Nancy_Scott: AERV E8 .AVER +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: IIJOSTT 13B JOIST +36 62
#note Best, nothing else worth consideration.
>Nancy_Scott: BCEI 7H BICE +13 35
#note Her best play that I can see with this rack fragment is CEIBA D4 or B13 JIB.  Either of those choices still lets me bingo, but for low 60's instead of what I was about to hit.
>Jim_Burlant: FGINRTT K5 FR.TTING +98 160
#note Best, winning 92%.
>Nancy_Scott: IX J10 XI +52 87
#note Just once this tournament can my opponent not come have a comeback play to my first bingo of at least 50 points? :-)
>Jim_Burlant: EFLNOQU 8K .OQUE +45 205
#note Best.  14B OF is also a very strong choice.
>Nancy_Scott: ?ENRRST O6 RE.NTeRS +58 145
#note Best play is O8 ENTERERS.
>Jim_Burlant: ADFLNOW 14A DOWN +41 246
#note Putting this down, I figured, "Ok, as long as she's not sitting on OY I should be ok."  I preferred to unload the W with this; the sim is conflicted between this and 14A FOND. Even at 1100 iterations the two plays are toggling back and forth for win percentage honors, though FOND wins the valuation battle by almost 2 points.
>Nancy_Scott: OY 15A OY +37 182
>Jim_Burlant: AFLMMNN I5 MA.N +19 265
#note Q prefers 9C FLAM to this, Q doesn't like this very much.
>Nancy_Scott: AHOTU M8 .UOTHA +38 220
>Jim_Burlant: FILMNRU H2 FIRM +16 281
#note Obviuolsly the best play is FILUM...but once I again I talk myself out of a word I've seen but am convinced I'm making up.  This is weak, but the draw completely bails me out of this blunder.
>Nancy_Scott: AEY 12C YA.E +31 251
>Jim_Burlant: AELNRSU 2H .UNERALS +76 357
#note Luckbox!  This is best, winning 96%.  
>Nancy_Scott: IP O1 P.I +15 266
>Jim_Burlant: DEGHOSV 15D SHOVED +47 404
#note Best.
>Nancy_Scott: ?DEEEIT 4A TwEEDIE. +68 334
#note The only playable bingo and a beautiful find.  I'm not sure I'd have found this with triplicated E's and a blank.
>Jim_Burlant: ABGIIOP A4 .IBIA +21 425
#note Q doesn't like this much, preferring 3C plays like POI or BOA.  Whatever, this game is over except for the final score.
