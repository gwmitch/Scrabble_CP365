#note Best.  Was a little worried about giving the open A hook down the 2x2, but I felt this rack had to be cleared out.  I'm not crazy about the CFT leave but I didn't think that ACMT was worth giving up 7 points given that my next best option was G7 FLAG.
>David_Pearl: ?ADEINT 9B pAINTED +69 77
#note Surprised David didn't take out the 2x2 with the AGAMA front hook but hey, I'll take it.  Play incorrectly scored as 70.
>Jim_Burlant: CFIKOTU 6I FUCK +22 42
#note Laughs all over as this came down, and I asked David, "Does this take an IT extension?"  :-)  Anyway...how often do you have these letters in your rack without this being the best play?  Sim likes 8A COFT; this gives up too many scoreboard points. I think a good compromise would have been KIF 6G, which I also didn't see.  This is so-so, as there's too much rack grooming going on; I was too busy trying to unload the U and the K and KUFI wasn't available for more than 15 points.
>David_Pearl: FLOT 8A LOFT +33 110
>Jim_Burlant: HIIJORT L6 .OJI +23 65
#note Best.  I was worried about giving back 30+ at O8, but an even bigger threat was looming.
>David_Pearl: ABEEIST 10I BEASTIE +79 189
#note David is winning 88% with this, his best bingo.  But not for long.  Play incorrectly scored as 80.
>Jim_Burlant: EHINORT O7 HER.INTO +86 151
#note Hanging by a thread, I'm back up from 12% to 21%.
>David_Pearl: BNRSU M2 BURNS +28 217
>Jim_Burlant: AAELPSU E4 PULA +20 171
#note No really good options available; this is one of the top 3 plays.  Q prefers 4L PRAU 14.  Is the L really worth 6 points given this board?
>David_Pearl: PW K9 P.W +20 237
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIRSY N13 AY +22 193
#note This is the runner up - sim prefers 2J YERBA 36.  This worked...in the short term.  I'm sitting at 23% winning chances.
>David_Pearl: W 13M W.. +12 249
>Jim_Burlant: AEIORSV 15H OVARIES +89 282
#note Briefly considered trying this at 15I for 39 more points but thought the better of it.  This is the best bingo, and it wins 58%...but not for long.
>David_Pearl: ?EEGNRU 4C Ex.UNGER +74 323
#note David was trying to draw a challenge with this choice, as he also saw 14B REBEGUN.  While the sim says REBEGUN is best, this play certainly did me in.  I was looking at a 54-point rack-cleaning HERTZ until this blocked it - now I not only had to play for 31, but I was stuck with all this dreck as well.  Terrific play by David.
>Jim_Burlant: EHRRTVZ J14 Z. +31 313
#note My thinking at the time was that, having played David, if I didn't take this out now, it wouldn't be around on the next turn.  And, having expected score 54 with this turn with HERTZ, it didn't occur to me to have to shift gears and view this as a time for a setup play, but that's what Quackle suggests...and I think Q is right.    Q's top 2 choices are 10A VERT and C2 EVERT.   VERT's strength is that it clears the rack, with the HRZ leave and EEEEIII unseen, it does set up a potential 84-point VIZIER.  In this particular game VIZIER would not have been possible,  since he was sitting on 2 of the 3 remaining I's.  EVERT is also strong as it sets me up to front hook it with something like ZERO 1A.  And with row 1 open, it might distract his attention from 14J.  
>David_Pearl: CEIIMNO 11D INCOME +24 347
#note David was puzzling over this position; he initially put down imino, picked it up, and put down this choice, as he was going for turnover.  Another intersting option he didn't look at was COMBE 2J.
>Jim_Burlant: AEHRRTV 12A HART +26 339
#note And if I had made one of the setup plays Quackle recommended last turn (I'd have gone with EVERT 2C) , I'd be sitting on ZA for 63 and would now be leading 360 - 347.  Q's preference is  prefernce is N1 RAH 25; this sims within 1/2 piont but 1-1/2% fewer winning chances.  Whatever.
>David_Pearl: ADIQ B11 Q.ID +28 375
#note And even if I hit ZA for 63, he'd have come back with QAID 12A 52 and I'd still be trailing by 39 points, as he did have the A as well.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEGRTV H1 VER.E +27 366
#note Q prefers TEGG H1, presumably to set up my best chance at an 8.  That line isn't likely to stay open against David, so I went for points.
>David_Pearl: EEIN 1E NIE.E +8 383
#note This isn't one of the original kibitzer choices, but this is by far the best play David can make with this rack fragment.  It wins 75% while none of the other choices even win 65.
>Jim_Burlant: DGLOOST C1 DOG.S +14 380
#note I have a bunch of out-in-two sequences with this LOST DOG rack, but no win.  A better sequence loses by roughly 10 - 15, but I can't do better.  Whatever.  This game really came down to who landed the X, as even if i'd made the recommended setup plays and hit something big with the Z, David would have still had his 54-point Q play and I still would have been down 30.   The question we'll never know the answer to - if I turn the extra 3 tiles instead of dumping the Z, does it get me the X?  Or does he still get it?
