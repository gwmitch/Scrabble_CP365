>Jim_Burlant: DELORRT 8G LOR +6 6
#note Believe it or not, this is best.  DERT is too powerful to give up the D for only 4 more points.  Score one up for the new words.
>Matt_Canik: BFFO 7H BOFF +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: DEMRTTV 9H TERM +16 22
#note I struggled here.  I don't care if I'm getting rid of my positive consonants or not - 3 unique tiles remained, 4 tiles turned with a bunch of positive stuff unseen...I have a hard time justifying an exchange when I can do that and score 16 in the process.  Quackle makes clear why I struggled so much with this turn:  exchanging DMTV, exchanging MTV, MTTV, or TTV and my play are virtually indistinguishable in a sim.  Style preference.
>Matt_Canik: AAEMT J7 .E.MATA +22 42
>Jim_Burlant: ADGOPTV 10D GAVOT +23 45
#note I saw L4 GAVOT but was only 50/50 on whether BOFF took the back O, since I could not remember ever having seen that played.  If the play was good it scored 33, but since I was unsure about it I didn't want to risk playing for 0, so that left this as the 100% safe compromise play.  GAVOT L4 is the correct play here. 
>Matt_Canik: EINO K9 .ONIE +26 68
>Jim_Burlant: CDLNPSW E8 CL.W +18 63
#note Q says I should play at E9 with PAWN or DAWN.  Makes sense since those plays don't give back easy points at 8A.  And PAWN gives me a potential 8A play hooking my S.
>Matt_Canik: EITY L8 YETI +26 94
#note Why on earth did I think TERME was good?  I need to challenge this off.
>Jim_Burlant: CDENPSV 12A VENDS +36 99
#note If overloaded with clunk, turn as many tiles as possible and score while doing it.  This is best.
>Matt_Canik: EGZ B11 G.EZ +28 122
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEPTY M5 TYPED +32 131
#note Took forever to find this, but I was pretty happy with it.  Apparently, M7 CADE is a hair better, presumably because it keeps the Y fo a 5 starting with Y at N10 on the next turn.
>Matt_Canik: AIOQTX 8A TOXI. +45 167
#note I think this was an accurate rack fragment - not 100% sure.  Post-mortem Matt second-guessed this play.  Sitting on the case T, he felt he should have played OXIC, forcing me to block - if I even could - whatever he was setting up (in this case,  QAT A6) on the next turn.  Had he done that, he would have really forced my hand and my only viable option would have been JO for cheap to block.
>Jim_Burlant: ACIIJSU K4 CUI. +18 149
#note Surprisingly strong choice, most likely because it gives me a good shot at JUICE 4H on the next turn.  Q gives a slightly higher preference to L3 AJI;I felt I hadto unload the U with 3 unseen.
>Matt_Canik: AINQR A5 QIN.AR +15 182
#note I can't remember his exact rack, but he either had a duplicated I or N on this turn, and he was chasing a blank with both unseen.
>Jim_Burlant: AHIJRSU B2 HAJI +39 188
#note I probably should have taken the extra 10 points with HAJIS, but this worked out.  FWIW, a sim says I was right to keep the S.  41% to win.
>Matt_Canik: OSW C3 WOS +43 225
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: ?AIPRSU A1 PUR +26 214
#note Wasn't entirely sure of the S hook on FERMATA (yes, it does take the S) and all I could see  in this was SPIRUlA.  RUPIAHS, PYURIAS, and PRIAPUS play on row 14 for 77 and 81.  I should be bingoing here.
>Matt_Canik: ELU 4B ..ULE +24 249
>Jim_Burlant: ?AHILOS 8L ..AH +30 244
#note More uncertainty and not wanting to take chances. This is the best non-bingo.  Still increasing my winning chances to 63%.
>Matt_Canik: AA C14 AA +13 262
>Jim_Burlant: ?BILOSS O1 SLOBbIS. +95 339
#note Go figure - all the whiffs to this point and I find SLOBBISH.  That said, BOSSILY 14H would have been better.  81% to win; BOSSILY wins 86.
>Matt_Canik: EO E3 O.E +6 268
>Jim_Burlant: ?IKNRRU 2E RINK +14 353
#note It's this or 2K KNURL to block a potential ADENINE out bingo on row 2.
>Matt_Canik: ADEEINN H1 E.ED +33 301
>Jim_Burlant: ?DENNRU 15C .RoUND +21 374
>Matt_Canik: AGI 3L AGI. +10 311
