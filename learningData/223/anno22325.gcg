>Marilyn_Wilkins: ABTTY 8H BATTY +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEINP K6 PA.INAE +18 18
#note For some reason I didn't know PAEAN, but I opted to go against my usual pattern here and just open up like crazy. I once scored 261 in a game because I decided to make a parallel play for 21 after my opponent opened with a bingo, when I should have just created as many floaters as possible. I thought about that game here. If I am lucky, she doesn't know the D hook, which I do.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: INTW L4 TWIN. +28 56
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEOSS J8 .OEA +14 32
#note Okay, don't panic yet.... and don't signal an S. I know I'm blocking stuff here, but would an exchange really be better than playing this?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: LM I7 L.M +17 73
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENSSS 4G SENSA.ES +59 91
#note Natural three-S bingo! Never again. It may not appear like a freaky rare occurrence, but I'd think that of all the instances where you have three esses on your rack, only a tiny fraction of the time is there a playable bingo. I kind of shrugged to Marilyn that it was "only" 59, but she responded that a bingo is a bingo. That it is.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ?DIMNOR 3B MINOReD +72 145
#note She must not have known the D hook, MIDIRON scores 85.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHINRU 2A UH +24 115
#note Reasonably low-risk with no ems left.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: DEGRV E1 GR.VED +22 167
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINOR 1C OR.ANDIE +83 198
#note Thankfully, I do know several eight letter words. Just playing ANEROID would have certainly been a lot worse.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ERZ L12 REZ +28 195
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIOOQR 6B QAI. +34 232
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AFT M13 FAT +33 228
>Matthew_Larocque: EEFLOOR 2J FLOOR +45 277
#note Scoring points is fun.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: BELP 1L PLEB +44 272
#note I did not expect that harsh of a response.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEGI N14 GI +34 311
#note Partial rack... think I had 3 Es here, last letter might have been an N. Dangerous play, but it's been a frenzy of scoring so I wanted to keep the momentum going I guess.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: VW C5 V.W +13 285
#note Caught her at a bad time?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEENO 15M ..E +9 320
#note Okay there's two bingos here. One is absolutely ridiculous and only a computer or Nigel Richards would ever find it. The second is findable for people who know eights or words with three Es in them. Since I don't fill the above requirements, I have to make this defensive play to clean up the mess I made last turn.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: IKRST 8A RISK +49 334
#note I ended up blocking KIST for 62.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEENO E8 sECONAE +74 394
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEENO --  -74 320
#note Choking mode: Active. I actually though SECONA was a six, and SECONAL was the adjective. I should probably get demoted to the division below me. 
>Marilyn_Wilkins: X A1 X. +27 361
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEENO 5C .O. +8 328
#note I'm already starting to pass out from the choke. I need to keep the S open so it takes her longer to block everything.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: CELO 10F COLE.. +20 381
#note I was seriously questioning the spelling here, but how badly did I want to botch this game? Because once it's triggered - the slippery slope of bad decisions, it's relentless and you start to panic and start asking questions you don't know the answer to. All I knew is I could still bingo and possibly win, so I wasn't going to challenge the stupid looking *COLEEN.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEEHN G9 H.E +10 338
#note I knew neither RECHANGE/REVANCHE, and there's a lot of ugly two-tile draws I could end up with here. I almost gave up and played (L)ECHEs  for 39 because I was still coughing and gagging. That would have been terrible.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: DJUY 12E JUDY +27 408
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEINT A8 .EACTINg +80 418
#note I dodged more than a few bullets, drawing IT, and Marilyn unable to deal with both threats.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (GIOTUU) +14 432
#note Managed to scrape by a game I attempted to lose. For some reason I only gained +10 from her letters, as if the G did not count. Then I lost 10 from time (I went over on the H(O)E play).
