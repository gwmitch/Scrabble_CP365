#note I missed the word DHOBI exerywhere this turn. Sloppy turn. I much like K5 DHOBIS for 36 here. Though it was early in the tournament and spread was important, and QADI is definitely the spread play, as it allows for a more open board to suit my lead as well as my leave.

>Josh: AAIKORS E11 ASK +32 220
#note This again was a sloppy play. E5 KA is correct here. I had this overthought scenario in my head of blocking everything but AS words down column B.
>Jeffrey_Jacobsen: EFZ 11I FEZ +37 166
>Josh: AAAIORU -AAAIORU +0 220
#note I had this hint that he didn't have very good tiles with FEZ, so I thought it was a great idea to go for the goodies. I should probably keep AR without that inference.
>Jeffrey_Jacobsen: NNOW 13E .NOWN +14 180
>Josh: ?CFLRSU B5 FULCRaS +72 292
#note Sneaked this by. If it's challenged off, he's screwed anyway. Already running low on time and will either open a spot for me or shut himself down probably.
>Jeffrey_Jacobsen: AELM 12J MALE +28 208
>Josh: AEHINOT A1 ETHION +37 329
#note Was mighty distracted this turn. I missed H12 H(W)AN and H13 (W)HO, both of which aren't better than this but still.
>Jeffrey_Jacobsen: EO H13 .OE +18 226
>Josh: AAGIIPT 13K PITA +32 361
#note This was definitely a spread-gaining play. I missed 6D PAT(T)I(N)G and PIt was just fine, but I didn't like the leave at all.
