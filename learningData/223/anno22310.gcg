>Jim_Burlant: ADEIINO 8D OIDIA +14 14
#note I couldn't decide what was right here and after debating between this and fishing of OI for 4, I felt that, since anything keeping a decent leave had vowel placement issues, I should just take the 14 points.  A sim indicates that this position is a matter of style preference.  The 10th best option wins within 1% and sims within 2 points of the best choice.  Any of the placements of OIDIA, 8H OI, IODINE are good.  Exchanging IO or AIO are also good choices.

#note Good play, but not quite best in Quackle's eyes.  Q likes 9E DENY and 9C MANED a little better, presumably because they don't open up the huge spot for an H.  I dunno - I think it's a little too early to be that worried about one of only 2 H's considering that this scores well and leaves me the best remaining combination of tiles I can have after this rack.  I'm fine with this.
>Patricia_Barrett: AESV E5 VA...ES +40 63
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENOR 11B REA.ONED +59 100
#note Only bingo - 60% to win in a short sim.
>Patricia_Barrett: CHNO D11 .NCHO +22 85
>Jim_Burlant: EEERSTY H11 .YERS +36 136
#note Chose this over EYRES because I wasn't 100% sure EYRE took the S and wasn't taking chances.  That said, if the duck is to be believed, I should just fish with YEH 14B.  Maybe, maybe not.  67% to win.
>Patricia_Barrett: INW 15A WIN. +21 106
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIIST I9 EI.E +11 147
#note The rest of the options (e.g.:  ICE 13C, 14D HIE) leave me EEIST which isn't bad, but it does have a little more potential to leave me vowel overloaded than EIST.  This is best.
>Patricia_Barrett: IOZ 13A ZOI. +30 136
>Jim_Burlant: ?EFIOST 14G F.OSTIEr +74 221
#note Thought I might have missed something better, and I did:  TREFOILS scores 86 at 14G, and SEMISOFT on row 15 scores 83.    Still in good shape at 87% to win.
>Patricia_Barrett: Q L13 Q. +11 147
>Jim_Burlant: EHLNORS 15M HER +24 245
#note Saw SHEN (one of the new words) and wasn't entirely sure of it, so, as I did with EYERS, took the sure 24.  I played off the R because LNOS struck me as a hair better leave-wise and there are 3 R's unseen and only 1 N.   If I'm more sure of my words, SHEN is the play here.  Given the board position and score, the consolation is that I have room to get away with this mistake.  Her only bingo lines are row 5 (the V isn't the easiest thing to extend into an 8) and the J column (which will only yield air balls). 
>Patricia_Barrett: AT 10A TA +8 155
>Jim_Burlant: AELNOSX J8 OX +18 263
#note I thought that she was awfully close to something, and that she probably had at least one, if not two, of the three unseen E's in her rack.  I felt that if I played off my E to play something like EXALT or NEXT down the A column, I wouldn't see one again and  I'd be in a potential dogfight if she hit down the J column.  I felt that, since the 18 points added 10 more points to my lead and left me a good combination (especially with EEERRRTTTT unseen) that could reply to her probable bingo.  
>Patricia_Barrett: TT 9H T..T +13 168
>Jim_Burlant: AAEELNS 7I ALE +14 277
#note And the strategy pays off...except that I suck and fail to recognize the new 8, ELASTANE, which would have double-doubled through the T in TEXT.  Bleah.
>Patricia_Barrett: F 8J .F +11 179
>Jim_Burlant: AEILNSU L1 INULASE +70 347
#note At least I find this.  Yippee.   It's this or its new anagram, INSULAE, and I'd rather not give her the S to play to.
>Patricia_Barrett: ?ACEITT 5G CApIT.TE +68 247
#note Other bingo options are PITTANCE 2G and ChAPATTI 5H.

#note Yikes!  Just shuffling tiles to end the game and not wanting to play CAPITATED until she's played off the V so I don't give her an easy DIVE.
