>Matthew_Larocque: HIJNTUY 8G JUN +20 20
#note I liked the defense of this.
>Jason_Krueger: OOW 9E WOO +17 17
>Matthew_Larocque: FHIMTTY 10F MYTH +41 61
>Jason_Krueger: AEHY J10 YEAH +42 59
#note I didn't expect him to outscore me the very next turn...
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFILLT K11 FLAT +31 92
#note As I play this, I wonder if he will attempt *FLATE, which is why I didn't play FLIT instead.  Not really a good reason to play this instead of FAIL or FLAIL, though.
>Jason_Krueger: BEEGNR 15H GREEN +29 88
>Jason_Krueger: BEEGNR --  -29 59
#note It's a trap!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILLNOP E4 PILLO. +22 114
#note I know he has GREEN now, and it doesn't seem like he can do much of anything with those letters, so I play this and hope to beat him to the punch. P(HA)LLI is 28 if I recognize that as the plural of PHALLUS, but I have to wonder if he lands an -ING 8 through the I. I wondered about *PILLONS but it's PILLION in my rack.
>Jason_Krueger: BEEGNR L12 BEEN +32 91
#note Interesting that he didn't play this last time.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AINOOZ I1 ZONAtIO. +68 182
#note I strongly debated if playing ZOO for 30-something was better, but felt that playing a bingo would just give me more momentum/turnover and a sure 68 points right now. If I'm really lucky he won't have a good response using the Z.
>Jason_Krueger: DGU J2 DUG +21 112
#note He sort of lets out a sigh and says he doesn't have anything for it. I was actually pretty shocked I got away with it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEEILO 1G CO. +42 224
>Jason_Krueger: ERUV 4H V..UER +28 140
#note Play off  DUG, then VU.... nobody wants to be in those shoes.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADDEEIL M2 DE.AILED +76 300
#note His dump leads to me having a bingo where I shouldn't have had one. I felt bad for Jason because this game seems to be completely favouring me right now.
>Jason_Krueger: AEMN M11 MANE +35 175
#note He has doubts on HAEM so has to play the lesser scoring play.
>Matthew_Larocque: BESTW 8L W.ET +33 333
#note Missed rack, taking out obvious scoring spot with undesirable W....
>Jason_Krueger: IRV 6B VIR. +15 190
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEIOSU D1 BEAU +26 359
>Jason_Krueger: DIR 1A DRI. +21 211
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIOQSX L1 QI +24 383
#note Bad miss of the N10 spot. Probably even better to tack the S on for 43.
>Jason_Krueger: EP D6 .EP +17 228
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEOSTX C8 AXOTES +47 430
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEOSTX --  -47 383
#note I was ignorant of OMA at this point, and thought this was worth trying to see if he let it go. Still, it's almost never a good idea to play a stupid phony. The game is never over until it's over. That's one thing I do know.
>Jason_Krueger: INT K6 NIT +11 239
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEOSTX B1 .AX +20 403
#note See last turn.
>Jason_Krueger: GR 2D .RG +8 247
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEOSST 11C TOEAS +29 432
#note Without he X, now I suddenly notice this. Also TASSO for 31.
>Jason_Krueger: IO A3 OI +12 259
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFRSST 12A CRAFTS +48 480
#note I once, many years ago, let Jason play a 3x3 on me. I still won, by like 40 points. But, he told me to always think to myself "what is the only way I can lose this game?". Now, I AM safe from even the worst ending here (STRICKEN or UNSICKER), but this type of carelessness won't always end so well. I should resist the points and just block the T so he can't bingo.
>Jason_Krueger: ?EGINRS O1 RaNGIES. +80 339
#note I quickly notice GRINCHES and painfully watch him shuffle letters for 5 minutes before he plays his backup outbingo. A win is a win, but it isn't always glorious.
>Jason_Krueger:  (KS) +12 351
