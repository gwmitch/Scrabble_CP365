#note Yuck.  It's either this or exchange 7.  My own preference is that there's nothing wrong with keeping an E.
>Darrell_Day: BERRV E7 R.VERB +22 46

#note Or  HEIR.  This is marginally better due to leave.

>Jim_Burlant: AINQRRU 15D .AQUI +48 82
#note Not thrilled with the NRR leave, but 48 points is 48 points, and none of my other options scores 30.  MURRAIN is the distant runner up, and that scores 27.  This is best - 39% to win.

#note Landing a blank was good, but the rest of this rack was hardly what the doctor ordered.  Q says I had more or less the right idea, but that I should have kept MN?, presumably because it thinks that B6 will be available. That said, Championship Player's evaluation suggests that it's style preference as to what to keep, as the top 3 exchanges (this is one of them) all win within 0.7% and evaluate within 0.7 points of each other.  
>Darrell_Day: IX 6B XI +53 149
>Jim_Burlant: ?CENORZ 5C REZ +28 110
#note This is best statically and it sims well, but it's not best .  One of the new words, CUZ, scores 25 at 14C and is best.  I never recognized it.  This is a very strong runner up, winning 0.4% less often and simming 1 point down at 1000 iterations. 34.5% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AEFOU A7 .AEFOU +39 188
>Darrell_Day: AEFOU --  -39 149
#note As Chris Cree is fond of saying, most phonies are illegitimate children of legitimate parents.  The word Darrell was thinking of was WAMEFOU.
>Jim_Burlant: ?BCGNOU G2 BOUNCi.G +65 175
#note Or BUNCOING in the same location. 54% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AEFINOU H1 FOIN +33 182
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AAIJLRT 14H TAJ +28 203
#note I debated between two plays:  AJAR 4A 33, and this.  I opted for this because, with 5 T's unseen, I didn't want to keep a T and wind up with tripllicated T's on the next turn.  The duck feels this turn is more or less another instance of style preference:  JAR 4B (which strikes me as reckless due to all the possible words like CLAW, FRAY, etc.) ostensibly wins the sim, and this is the runner up.  AJAR sims marginally behind this.
>Darrell_Day: AENP 4A NEAP +27 209
#note Then again, what does he do with this if I play AJAR?
>Jim_Burlant: AILRTTW A7 .AWL +30 233
#note It's either this, WILT, or A1 TWIN.  I don't like keeping duplicated T's, but 9 points seemed like a bit too much to give up to unload them, and the duck agrees.  The game is a wash:  50% to win.
>Darrell_Day: FLNORSU 6F S.ORNFUL +67 276
>Jim_Burlant: AGIKRTT A1 TRA.K +27 260
#note Best play here is a word I didn't know:  M3 TITLARK for 34, and this makes sense:  the pool has AAATTT unseen, it scores 7 more than this, and turns 6 tiles instead of 4 with the blank unseenl .  The consolation:  it wouldn't have mattered.
>Darrell_Day: ?AEOPSS M2 SOAP.EsS +72 348
#note If I had known TITLARK, he still would have back hooked it with APPOSES, SCAPOSE, SAPOTES, or PETASOS on row 10 and my bingo wouldn't play.  This or SEPALOUS in the same location are Darrell's best choices.  Of note:  SOAP(BO)xES 2C.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIRTT J5 G.ATTIER +61 321
#note Only bingo, but it's bleak - 9.3% to win.
>Darrell_Day: OY L4 YO. +26 374
>Jim_Burlant: EILMSTT 4L ..M +8 329
#note  I'm sitting on the case S and without a good scoring play available (MET for 20 at K11 just seems like it's throwing in the towel as it blocks the column and I need a bingo), I felt I should open the triple up to see if he could defend it.  This isn't one of the original options but the sim really likes it:  it's either this or 14C TUM, and the sim indicates either wins as much as the other.  Depending on his rack, if I draw a D (the most probable tile in the pool), I may have an unblockable STILTED.
>Darrell_Day: OY 5J .O..Y +39 413
#note Then again, the best laid plans...
>Jim_Burlant: EEILSTT 8M .ET +6 335
#note Another fishing situation.  Best is ostenstibly I1 ET for 12 but it would not have mattered.
>Darrell_Day: ACDE 12J .ACED +16 429
>Jim_Burlant: EEILOST N10 TI.ES +16 351
#note TIES O1 scores 25, but whatever.  There really wasn't anything I could have done about this.
