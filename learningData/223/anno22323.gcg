#note It's a close call between this or exchanging.  Maybe it was wishful thinking on my end but I felt that with an I already out and 2 more in my rack, the I wasn't as likely of a draw as it would otherwise be, so I decided to risk it.  The duck thinks this is nominally the best play, but exchanging IQ or IIQ sim as equally valid options.

#note Ugh - yet another bunch of mediocre options.  I didn't like ZOARIA because I didn't like giving back all sorts of easy points if he had AD or FA in his rack.  This isn't bulletproof but it'll be marginally tougher for him to hit for huge points at 8A than if I give him H12.  The duck says I should just take the extra points and turnover with ZOARIA.  The consolation:  he was bingoing no matter what I put down here.  50% to win (ZOARIA wins 51-1/2% and this sims 3 points down) but not for long.
>Steve_Glass: ?EINTTU D7 NUTTIEr +68 96
#note Other options include TENUITy D9, QUOTIENT E7.  This or the D6 placement are best.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIIRR J3 RAGI +11 58
#note Yet another bunch of mediocre options as I continue to run the tile treadmill.  It's this or the same word at C12 or J9.  28% to win.
>Steve_Glass: DIJN J9 DJIN +31 127
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMRUX 10G XU +28 86
#note I saw 28 points, the AEIMR leave and didn't look further.  I didn't even notice XENIA 12H, but it doesn't matter - the duck confirms that, despite the points given up, the AEIMR leave with this choice is so potent that this is the correct choice.  27% to win.
>Steve_Glass: FMOO E4 MOFO +20 147
>Jim_Burlant: AEILMRY D4 MY +31 117
#note It comes down to two choices:  D2 LIMY or this.  I felt 31 and keeping this rack together was more than worth it and didn't look for anything else.  The duck takes a while to sort itself out but it eventually agrees with me.  28.5% to win.
>Steve_Glass: CDEORST 13H COSTED +33 180
#note Q thinks he should just fish the D somewhere.  Or maybe OD K10 for 21.  Regardless, I was very glad to see that he floated the D:
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHILR M6 RAILHEA. +64 181
#note Only bingo but I'm still a bit of an underdog:  38% to win.

#note Wow:   I spent so much time looking for the O1 play that wasn't there that I then merely focused on something on row 2 or 3 that would take out the TRAGI possibilities.  The best play here is absolutely sick:  AEROBeS K2 scores 91.  If ou miss that, the rest of your options are in the 70's, as this was.  The points I missed here cost me the game. 
>Steve_Glass: OR H13 .OR +15 231
>Jim_Burlant: DEEEOUW H1 WE. +24 277
#note I considered 2L plays and was so scared that he was close to something that I didn't want to give him somewhere for an easy 7.  I felt this was a play-the-board-before-playing-my-rack position, which is why I chose this after much deliberation.  Q says I should have just played WEE 2L and bitten the bullet.  Q may be right here.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEEOUW 1A WA.ED +33 310
#note At this point I wasn't worrying as much about building another rack as I was about putting points on the board.  Q agrees with me - this is best.  68% to win.
>Steve_Glass: FKR L12 K.RF +42 303
#note OUCH!
>Jim_Burlant: BEOOUUV 2L BOO +20 330
#note This is where  I really felt like I lost the plot.  If he had only scored 20 - 25 on the prevous turn, I'd have probably exchanged.  But I felt the need to keep putting points on the board.  For whatever reason, this tournament I repeatedly couldn't think of the word BUTEO, so I whiffed on that.   It tells you how bad this last draw was that my previous play won 68% and my best option this turn barely wins 38.  If I had this turn to do again, I'd probably pass 7 tiles.

#note Q thinks this is awful, but Steve told me post-mortem that he was going to bingo to the R if I hadn't blocked.  VENTURE or UNTRUE look a little better in retrospect.
