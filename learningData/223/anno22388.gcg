#note When I played WEEPY I noticed SWEEPY. I instantly forgot about it. Good thing it didn't cross Sary's mind.
>Joshua_Sokol: AANORRU L8 .OURA +15 174
#note I could have just been patient and defensive with C2 RUANA, but things weren't looking good for me on a closed board, given that I can't score much in my next moves and there are many spots in which Sary can score.
>Sary_Karanofsky: DEIOV L2 VIDE +29 196
#note She missed VIDEO here.

>Joshua_Sokol: EEGINOR H11 .GONE +24 240
#note ERIGERON being blocked, I now have to cross my fingers and hope for something next turn. There are too many ways for her to burn me on H10 or H11. I can't leave that spot open. I have to be offensive here. Fishing is also not an option as Sary plays defensively. Maybe I'm overestimating the likelihood of her scoring down column H versus the likelihood of her getting a bingo down through my floaters, and 11A GOR(S)E is actually correct. I don't think so.
>Sary_Karanofsky: AEENSST 14D NEAT.ESS +62 294
#note That S(WEEPY) hook is costing Sary a lot of points. Nevertheless, she still would have gotten a bingo down had I played GOR(S)E. But that play does much better against opponents who see and know S(WEEPY), and I was still blind to it myself.

>Sary_Karanofsky: OVW 13C VOW +26 320
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IKLNRS N6 .INKLeRS +63 357
#note Now it's my turn to sacrifice a whole lot by missing S(WEEPY). RELINKS and LINKERS play for 97. Although I am in good shape after this, I am definitely not out of the ballpark, as you will see.
>Sary_Karanofsky: DIX -  +0 320
#note Sary challenges, and instantly regrets it. Had she played I11 (N)IX(E)D this turn, she most likely would have won.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIINOP O13 ION +11 368
#note I'm stuck having to sacrifice points here to block IXTLE at 15K. That seems to be the only easy way for me to lose.  M12 ION was the best play that blocks IXTLE, but I didn't think I could withstand (N)IX(E) and YELD or YETI down at O12. I can block the Y-bomb but it didn't seem like I could afford to. These are all very unlikely scenarios but again, it seemed the only way I could easily lose this game. Anything that's tough for Sary to work out was not anything I was worrying about. Even a top player might have trouble with this 1-in-the-bag pre-endgame. 
>Sary_Karanofsky: DIX I11 .IX.D +44 364
#note I regretted not playing ION for 8 at 15J when this came down, but it seemed setting up my P at M13 overcame the points I lost by not blocking NIXED and only allowing NIXE.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFIIPU O7 FE +26 394
#note This is 11 points off a play I missed followed by another play I missed. E12 A(WE)E and 8A PFU(I). Oy.
>Sary_Karanofsky: ILRTY 12K L.I. +6 370
#note good block of PIU, but this is 20 points off the simple out in two; 9K (DO)R(K)Y+G1 LIT or vice versa.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIIPU 5C ..I.AI +16 410
#note This might have been my worst play! I set up an out for Sary unwittingly. -17 to a play I didn't see once again, C7 UP. Don't worry, it gets better...
>Sary_Karanofsky: RTY 9K ..R.Y +23 393
#note -17 for Sary as well, as she obviously misses that a player of my caliber just gave her an outplay. I do not blame her.
>Joshua_Sokol: PU H4 P.U +8 418
#note And I miss C7 again! Congrats me.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (T) +2 420
