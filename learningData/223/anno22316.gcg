>Dave_Stone: AELO 8H OLEA +8 8
#note Context:  I had watched my previous 3 opponents out-bingo me 10 - 5; each one had followed up a bingo with a bingo out of the bag and each one had an X or Z play for at least 54 points while I was struggling with racks and many poor draws.  This game was where this started to get to me, affecting my play.
>Jim_Burlant: CCDILNR J3 CIRCL.D +18 18
#note I don't have any really good options; what this play comes down to is, "which 18-point rack dump do I want to make?"  Q gives slight preference to CLERIC J6 and RANCID K7.  That said, nothing really stands out in the sim and anything is more or less as good as anything else.
>Dave_Stone: GHU 3J .HUG +20 28
>Jim_Burlant: AGHLNOW 5G WHO.L +22 40
#note Ugh.  Board blindness.  HOWL 4L!
>Dave_Stone: EES 6F SEE +15 43
#note Uh oh...
>Jim_Burlant: ADGNNOR 4C ANDRO +18 58
#note Less may be a bit more here:  NOD 7E is 17 to this play's 18.  No reason to have to blow this apart, but the one-two punch of mistakes he makes on the next sequence is what turned the game in my favor.
>Dave_Stone: ABEINST 9B BANTIES +63 106
#note He must have missed OBEISANT, which plays at H8 83. He told me he didn't like BASINET N1, as he felt it gave back too much, which left this.  
>Jim_Burlant: FGIINOW C8 W.IFING +28 86
#note It's this or BOWFIN B9.  BOWFIN may be better against the computer, as that wins 29% to this play's 28%,  but against Dave this was the best play I could have made, as I caught a huge break:
>Dave_Stone: EIOQSUU -  +0 106
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: EOPPSTT 4L POT +21 107
#note You gotta know it to play it:  14A PEGTOP scores 34 and is best.  This is a respectable second:  49-1/2% to win.  
>Dave_Stone: ADNRUU 14A UN.UARD +22 128
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEKPST O1 KEPS +40 147
#note TThe only bingoes I could identify in this rack were the obvious PERKIEST/PESKIEST, and they don't play.  The only playable bingo is a word I didn't know:  SPIKELET 12A for 80.  Best non-bingo is 3A PEKE, but given how I've been drawing in this tournament, I don't want to have to burn both my E's.  This is reasonable, but not best, if you don't know the bingo.
>Dave_Stone: AETT 15E TEAT +19 147
>Jim_Burlant: EGMRRRT 12A GR.M +18 165
#note I couldn't remember if it was GRUM or GRUN* that was the phony and was taking no chances.  GRUM A12 scores 27 and is the obvious play here.
>Dave_Stone: JOY 3A JOY +36 183
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEMRT N4 .EAMsTER +63 228
#note TELEMARK!  This is awful.  TELEMARK wins 89%; this wins 70.  That said, for about the only time this tournament, I was about to finally land the right tiles at the right time.
>Dave_Stone: ABEOV M9 ABOVE +31 214
>Jim_Burlant: IILNSVZ 11J VIZ.. +34 262
#note Now it's looking really good:  this scores well, and I have the case S for a potential play at O11.  This is best, and it's 82% to win in a short sim.
>Dave_Stone: AEINT A1 TA.INE +42 256
>Jim_Burlant: ?DILNOS 1A .OLIDiNS +77 339
#note Only bingo.  92% to win.
