>Jim_Burlant: ADHILOX 8G HOAX +28 28
#note Not sure I agree with the duck here. Q wants me to play HALID or HALOID to set up the X on the next turn.  Not sure the spots at G7 or G9 stay open on the next turn.  I'd rather try to build the bingo rack.
>Joey_Krafchick: OO J7 O.O +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADDGIL I7 D.G +19 47
#note FAIL.  The 2 bingos that play are DIALOGeD and the new 7, ADeLGID, and I whiffed on all of them.  The only thing I saw in this rack was ADDLInG, pADDLING, etc.    In a sim this barely registers as more than a minor slip...but this is probably the only missed bingo I had this tournament that actually impacted the win/loss, though it wouldn't have stopped him from bingoing on his next turn.
>Joey_Krafchick: ACNOORT K1 CARTOON +72 82
#note If I find any of the bingos on the last turn, he still has CORONATE.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGILU K9 DUG +15 62
#note Fail X 2.  I spent forever looking for something on rows 2, 3, and 4 (there is nothing) and the only 7 I could think of was LANGUID/LAUDING.  LANGUID/LAUIDING don't play and tthe bingo I couldn't think of was GAUDILy, which would have scored 74 at L7.  his is beyond lame.  If I miss the bingos I should at least be able to find LUDIC or CAULD on row 1. From this piont on I can't win the game.

#note I finally get one right.  31% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: EIISSSY O1 YES +27 158
#note Couldn't think of CISSY - definitely looks best here.
>Joey_Krafchick: ?BDEELN E5 BLEED.Ng +90 256
>Jim_Burlant: FIISSTT 12K SIFT +20 178
#note Simply trying to balance the rack and set up a hook for my other S.  11% to win...but not for long.
>Joey_Krafchick: AAEEEMR N6 AMEERA.E +64 320
#note Only bingo for Joey.  In case you're keepng track, this is the second consecutive opponent to have back-to-back bingoes and a power-tile bomb within 5 turns of each other.
>Jim_Burlant: FIJMRST 14J FIRMS +58 236
#note I might be better of here keeping the S and playing RIFT O6 for 44...but I saw 58 points and that was that.  No matter how you cut it, it's beyond bleak:  RIFT wins 3.3%, this wins 2.3.
>Joey_Krafchick: AEIPTW 15E TAWPIE +38 358
>Jim_Burlant: EEJNOTU 6B JOU.E +30 266
#note Maybe I should just throw in the towel and not worry about rack building any more, given that this gameis pretty much over already.  O5 JEON scores 45.
