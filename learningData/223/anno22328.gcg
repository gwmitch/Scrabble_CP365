>Jason_Krueger: AEERV 8D REAVE +18 18
#note This round we started playing repeats, and Jason didn't have to wait long to play me again and hope for a better draw.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DLNNRT F7 L.ND +9 9
#note Sets up an E, that's about all I can do.
>Jason_Krueger: AABL 6F BAAL +26 44
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CDINNT H5 C.N.D +8 17
#note I hesitated on this just because it kind of clogged the board and made bingos harder to play. DINT/REAVED? Probably.
>Jason_Krueger: AKOY E10 OAKY +25 69
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IILNTT C2 TILTINg +72 89
#note Didn't know (K)ITTLINg, and I should at least play TITLINg instead.
>Jason_Krueger: FGU B1 FUG +21 90
>Matthew_Larocque: ?MNORRS A1 OM +32 121
#note Literally draw ?S after that bingo. 
>Jason_Krueger: ADIOR 5H .ARDIO +20 110
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DENRRS 12A DRiN.ERS +80 201
#note No breaks for Jason.
>Jason_Krueger: HU B5 UH +28 138
>Matthew_Larocque: EELORST N5 SOLERET +71 272
#note In the old dictionary, this bingo is homeless.
>Jason_Krueger: HOW A12 .HOW +33 171
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEENQS 8L BE.N +27 299
#note NIQAB!!!! I really need to see that.

>Jason_Krueger: EFI D3 FIE +26 218
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIRSU K5 .UE +4 325
#note Too greedy, B10 AU(R)EI is 23.
>Jason_Krueger: IU 9H .UI +5 223
#note What's he got?
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIPRSW B11 W.AP +31 356
#note WASPIER blocked.
>Jason_Krueger: EEIJT O11 EEJIT +41 264
#note Jason said it gave him great pleasure to play a new J-five.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIPRSV 15H PERVIES. +92 448
#note Ridiculous.
>Jason_Krueger: AMYZ -  +0 264
#note He might as well, PERVY might have been a stand-alone word.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIOOTX M13 AX. +20 468
#note If I play something like OX 13H, he probably plays M10 MAZY and I get to play TI(Z). But that's impossible to know. I also don't have to play the X right away. M2 AGI(O) is neat, setting up OXO.
>Jason_Krueger: ACMNSYZ L10 MAZY +41 305
>Matthew_Larocque: GIOOTT K9 TOT +19 487
#note This gives him a better play, I should have played TO(i)T instead at least.
>Jason_Krueger: CNS J8 C.S +14 319
>Matthew_Larocque: GIO D8 .IG +9 496
>Jason_Krueger: N I14 N. +2 321
#note M5
>Jason_Krueger:  (O) +2 323
#note Jason wasn't too antsy to play me for a third time. Unfortunately, there would be a third time.
