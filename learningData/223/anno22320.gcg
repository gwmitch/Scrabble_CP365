>Jim_Burlant: DFIMNRS 8G FIRM +18 18
#note It's either this or FIRMS, and I prefer to hold the S.  Q agrees - this is best. 
>Mike_Early: AIKRST K3 KRAITS +30 30
>Jim_Burlant: DDGNNSW 6J W.ND +16 34
#note I don't like giving up the potentially huge Y hook, but there are only 2 of them and the bag still has 73 tiles in it.  Q agrees - this is best.  
>Mike_Early: EP 3K .EP +18 48
>Jim_Burlant: DDEGINS 4I GI.D +18 52
#note After wisely passing up REDDINGS*, given the problems I had building a rack in my previous game, I got too protective of my promising rack.  I need to look to score here and not try to build bingo racks.  What surprises me is that this only gives up 3% winning chances to N2 DINGS, which is the play I should have made.  That said, he was going to bingo this turn no matter that I put down here.  52% to win, but not for long.
>Mike_Early: AEGIRST N6 SEAGIRT +73 121
#note Or STAGIER.
>Jim_Burlant: DEMNSUW 8M M.W +24 76
#note WUD 2L gets rid of both the UW combo, but the board position is way too dangerous.  This is best.  27%, but his next turn made me very nervous:
>Mike_Early: BI I2 BI. +7 128
>Jim_Burlant: BDENPSU 2L PUB +24 100
#note Now that BIG blocks potential bingos, this isn't so dangerous.  Surely I can draw something good to DENS, right?
>Mike_Early: ?EIILRT 11G fLIRTIE. +64 192
#note 7C NITRILE 69, or TROILITE on row 12.
>Jim_Burlant: DENOOSS O1 OS +14 114
#note Right idea, wrong execution. 1L IS scores 2 more.  But apparently, I should abandon the fishing with ODEON 12H 28.  11% to win, and ODEON wins 12.75.
>Mike_Early: AA J1 AA +10 202
#note Play incorrectly scores as 69.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENOS 9L DO.E +17 131
#note Right idea, wrong execution:  EGO 9M preserves the D.  The only loss is a handful of equity points, as everything wins between 10.9 and 12.5%.
>Mike_Early: ?AEELNO 9C ENOLAsE +69 271
#note The star play is H7 LINOLEATE for 77!  Anyway -  Mike is 98.8% to win but the scary thing: he wasn't even close to being finished.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEHNNS 8A NAH +23 154
#note Coming on the heels of heartbrerak hotel against Orry and my 238-point disaster against Cree, his ENLOASE bingo was where I officially crossed Caro's Misery Threshold and stopped doing anything more than moving tiles to end the game.
>Mike_Early: AEFY H11 .EAFY +36 307
>Jim_Burlant: AENORSX O12 AXON +39 193
#note And once again, an X, Q, J, or Z shows up when it gets in the way of a promising rack, forcing me to break it up...
>Mike_Early: CEILORT 13C LORIC.TE +78 385

>Jim_Burlant: CDESTUU 5D EDUCTS +25 276
#note TUQUES for 45 to get above 300, but like I said - I was beyond rational thinking at this point, given the severity of how badly I was being bagged.
