>Kunihiko_Kuroda: ACEINTU -ACEIN +0 0
#note my 2-5 first day had me playing Japan's lone representative at Worlds.
>JD: AACDEET 8D CAAED +22 22
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: CER 9G REC +15 15
>JD: EGGITTZ 7G GIG +19 41
>JD: ENTTUYZ (challenge) +5 46
#note TEG is a smart play that sets up ZEA for next turn. this is much worse. he challenged GER which is new in CSW12.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: NRU 6H RUN +13 28
>JD: ENTTUYZ 5E NUTTY +29 75
#note I was overly eager to get TRIDE# on the board and attempt to draw another 5 point challenge. just playing YUTZ this turn is the way to go, although it is fascinating that keeping EZ and keeping ENT score the same number of points per turn for me next turn, showing the power of the Z in CSW.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: AEP 4C PEA +12 40
>JD: ABEINNZ E7 B.NZAI +34 109
#note I may have been distracted into this play by the fact that my opponent was japanese. Q suggests either the more defensive option of BENZIN at 3D or ZINEB at K3, keeping EN does not upgrade my leave significantly over AN on this closed board with lots of vowels left.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: ?AEIRRS 13B RAISERs +82 122
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: BEO (challenge) +5 127
#note it would've been pretty entertaining had this come off the board, but I was thinking of BONSAI.
>JD: ?EFLNNT 11A FENT.NyL +60 169
#note the almost certain bingo and 3x3 potential of FLINT makes it a major upgrade over bingoing immediately. I was not playing very well.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: BEO 10A OBE +28 155
>JD: GHLSUXY K4 GUSHY +28 197
#note this play sucks, the X isn't doing anything particular on this board. Much better to just play LUX and hope to draw one of the 7 Os for a cheap play of GOOFY for 48.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: EIOORST 3B SOOTIER +79 234
>JD: ADILNPX A13 PIX +45 242
#note after playing terribly for most of the game I finally find a good play.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: AJM 2A JAM +35 269
>JD: ADLNOOV H1 VO. +18 260
#note at this point it's all about the points on this closed board, ONNED at F10 is best.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: DITU L2 DUIT +18 287
>JD: ADELNOO 8K .ODLE +30 290
#note my tempo for opening the board is not good, and he has had a few turns to groom his rack, but I did not want to resort to fishing to win with the score this close.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: IQ F2 Q. +31 318
>JD: AILNORT O5 ORI.NTAL +59 349
#note to continue my pursuit of bad scrabble, I somehow could not find ANTIROLL over the board, denting my winning chances y 10%. I also play my second potential opponent-themed word of the round.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: OW 9B OW +24 342
>JD: DEFHIMV M1 FEH +31 380
#note there were no bingos that I was particularly scared of, but it seemed better to keep a tile in the bag for tempo purposes. Playing over here helps a little bit with potential high-scoring plays like KADES/WADES but I should really play VIM leaving THIEF for 40 at the bottom-left.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: EO 1M .OE +18 360
>JD: ADIIMVW 10J DIMWI. +18 398
#note 11 worse than just playing WADED, but DIMWIT is probably best if I don't think he's going to spot KADES.
>Kunihiko_Kuroda: AEEKLS M10 .EEKS +24 384
>JD: AV 2J VA.. +16 414
>JD:  (AL) +4 418
#note this may have been the most consistently worst-played game of mine from this year, if not superseded by a later game from this tournament. miraculous that I won.
