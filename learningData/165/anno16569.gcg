>Mack_Meller: ACEGTYZ 8H CAGEY +30 30
#note A big thanks to Mack for providing most of his racks. This was probably my luckiest game of the tournament!
>Siddharth_Murali: DEEMTUV 9K DEV +19 19
#note I felt that the attrocity of the U was partially negated by the M. I played this over VUG because i didn't think the leave was much worse. This sims pretty well.
>Mack_Meller: ABDNTTZ 7I ZA +45 75
#note BATT for 29 looks good, saving a much better leave and getting ZAG next turn, or perhaps a much bigger Z play.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EFIMTU 10F FUMIEsT +80 99
>Mack_Meller: BCDDNTU 6J BUNDT +28 103
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EEISUW 11D EWE +17 116
#note The other options I considered were WEE in the same spot and WEE(D). I chose not to play WEE because letting Mack hooking the A and the T causes me to lose board shape, especially since I'm the favorite to bingo at f12 next turn (the board will be tight after that). WEED is similarly defensively weak in the long run. I didn't even consider WE/FE, because although E's are good, I do not want vowel glut. This sims alright.
>Mack_Meller: CDLO 12C CLOD +30 133
>Siddharth_Murali: ?IMNOSU O3 MOUSINg +86 202
#note I didn't know SPUMONI. Although that gives back an S hook, it is much better long term defense. 
>Mack_Meller: BILOORU 3K BLOO. +18 151
#note A tough spot to be in. Maybe BROOM, 'cause of all the R's in the bag.
>Siddharth_Murali: AHHINNQ 4J QI +15 217
#note This is mediocre. Mack told me after the game that maybe I should exchange, but I simply did not want to give him a free lane. My mistake was not knowing ABLOOM. I hate playing HAH there because there are three esses out but NAH there looks okay.(C)HIN is just moronic.
>Mack_Meller: IRRSUVX 9G XU +41 192
>Siddharth_Murali: AGHHLNN N2 H.N +14 231
#note NOH in the same spot is best. I just completely whiffed it.
>Mack_Meller: IJRRSTV L1 TI.S +34 226
>Siddharth_Murali: AGHILNR 1H HAIN. +24 255
#note Bad, bad, bad. I should either play LIGHT or ALIGHT.
>Mack_Meller: FJKRTTV -JKVFTT +0 226
#note Don't have the exact rack here, but this is the only reason I won!
>Siddharth_Murali: DGLOPRW 2F PLOW +25 280
#note GOWD, another bad miss. That makes it just so hard for him to do anything, pretty much.
>Mack_Meller: AAAEOST 3F AA +10 236
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEGINR 4A READING +79 359
#note And of course, not only do I draw a bingo out of GRD, but he gives me a perfect spot to play it.
>Mack_Meller: AEEEOST C12 .EE +10 246
>Siddharth_Murali: EFIIITV A4 .IVET +24 383
>Mack_Meller: AAEGOST 3A GOA +24 270
>Siddharth_Murali: EFIIORY 14B R.IFY +38 421
#note I thought this was defensive enough to justify taking the points.
>Mack_Meller: AENORST 15F ATONERS +79 349
>Siddharth_Murali: EEIKLOR B7 LIKE +14 435
#note I lost like over 30 points on this endgame. lol

#note If I bagged someone this tournament, I least wanted it to be Mack :/.
