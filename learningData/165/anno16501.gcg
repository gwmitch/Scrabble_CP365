#note YO is totally better. The reason I exchanged was because I'll obviously bingo more often after AE? than AEEQ?, but that's no reason to make things easy for my opponent. The position dictates YO. This is a serious leak in my game! (-7) 
>Ruth: AHP 9E PAH +25 35
#note Interestingly, Elise plays OPAQuE F7, with YO about 1% back. I don't understand that.

#note If you spotted this, well done! But it's not the awesome play.

#note I nearly missed this. Those don't look like bingo letters, and that doesn't look like a bingo lane. And yet, it fits! FOLKsONG: #3 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown!

#note Drat. No WILLIWAU for me today.

>Carl: IILLNRU 1B ILLU... +11 385
#note I was pretty happy to have found this, but INURE N4 wins slightly more often. Can't resist them style points.
>Ruth: AAUV -AAUV +0 343
>Carl: EEEGINR 15F RE.....ING +45 430
#note If FOLKSONG wasn't as flashy as previous entries, other big plays like this and JASMINE help make up the difference. If I had actually gotten to play WILLIWAU, I think I'd have to give this game the #1 spot.
>Ruth: AY 12G AY +23 366
>Carl: DEEENRV C1 .EVERED +26 456
#note Quackle Championship player fishes with AWEE G12. DEENRV hits bingos with the A, N, and T, but Ruth might well block.
