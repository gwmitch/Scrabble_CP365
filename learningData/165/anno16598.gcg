#note the competition was going to be tough for the morning.
>JD: DEEHOUZ 9G OH +14 14
#note with the Z in hand, quackle suggests that I am hurting myself by playing OH and not creating any future scoring spots. it is against my instincts to sacrifice points to open the board, but in this case I can see how HULE# would start to clean up my rack without giving any huge scoring spots.

#note a gamble based on his last play but much better than anything else I have

#note for the 4th time this tournament, I incorrectly play a bingo - CLEVE at B10 takes away some big scoring plays and bingoes 68% of the time next turn. perhaps this is a collins adjustment I need to start making.

#note damnit craig!
>JD: ABCILPQ 6J QIBLA. +39 354
#note should be trying to keep the board as open as possible, I think playing at C2 is a little better now - none of the lanes at the top-right is all that great. I was really hoping to draw something on column D.

#note I have a real chance, keeping KIPP as insurance is really nice.

>JD: IMOPPRT 1E IMPORT +36 424
#note this is the only play that wins any endgames - if I draw the S, he plays KORO to block KOPS and then I play SAP/SNY and win by 1 point! this did not happen, but at least he also didn't bingo out with SAILBOARD
