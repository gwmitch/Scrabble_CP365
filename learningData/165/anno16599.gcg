#note the only time before I played Hubert Wee, the dictionary was inexplicably set to TWL and I challenged off UPLEANED#.

>JD: ALTUWYZ 5G WAL.Z +34 112
>Hubert_Wee: ABEEELS 6A SEEABLE +68 130
>JD: CEIOTUY A4 CO.EY +39 151
#note CESTUI# might be the weirdest word I can think of. "he, that one"? Nice definition. Anyway, I sadly whiffed on the runaway best play, SOCIETY.
>Hubert_Wee: AF 5D FA +23 153
>JD: GIIJMTU F8 .IGIT +11 162
#note the tricky RIMU at 7J scores more points without giving too much back.
>Hubert_Wee: ADL E9 LAD +19 172
>JD: AJMNNUV B8 UNJAM +35 197
#note UNJAM gives up a lot of extra points compared to JNANA, although the leave is much less ugly.
>Hubert_Wee: IO C10 OI +13 185
>JD: LNNOOUV 4F VOL +16 213
#note an ugly position, NOON at 4E leaving LUV wins the sim. it's not like NOUN is any better as a leave.

#note not a great draw, at this point it seemed like I had to gamble on him not being able to hit this spot, even though the S blank and N all hit here.
>Hubert_Wee: ?AAIORR O4 ORARIAn +82 409
#note game over, +5 for him to be sure
>JD: ABEGNNR 15K REGNA +29 343
#note I might have been hasty to throw in the towel, the lane on row 15 is still there if I can pull the S. I think GRABEN on this move at N1 has a real shot if I can pull the case I and N.
>Hubert_Wee: KOW N4 WOK +43 452
>JD: BEFINUX H12 ..NI +25 368
#note low on time, I wanted to block the S hook but instead I should've played BRUX on this turn to set up a nice out.
>Hubert_Wee: DEGNPS D3 DE..NG +26 478
>JD: BEFUX 3I B.UX +16 384
>Hubert_Wee: PS L6 SP. +8 486
#note two games in a row against strong opponents in which I didn't play badly, my game against craig was strong, but in this one I made some sloppy mistakes early.
