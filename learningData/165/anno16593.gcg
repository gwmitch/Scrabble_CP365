#note I spent a long time on this play trying to figure out what would keep the board most dynamic, with the thought being that the sooner I bingo, the sooner I get back in the game - OOP is a smart play that leaves me with an extra lane on row 6 (not that easy to hit, but better than just an S hook) and bingo-friendly tiles
>Nakul_Prabhu: BRW F7 W.RB +15 85
>JD: ADEFLNU D3 FLAUN.ED +74 92
#note the UNFABLED#/FUNDABLE# combination was not one I knew, although I had studied DEARNFUL#
>Nakul_Prabhu: IMNOR C9 MINOR +30 115
>JD: EJKSUWX 6J JEW +57 149
#note big error, JEUX is surely better
>Nakul_Prabhu: HNU B10 HUN +33 148
>JD: AKRSUUX M2 KURUS +32 181
#note instead of burning my S, I could've had a much more flexible leave if I had kept KSW instead of KSUX, which sounds more like the name of a bad radio station.

>JD: AAABGST N1 GA. +20 239
#note it takes a little bit of nerve, but ABAFT sims much better than my play, as does BAFT. with two blanks unseen, I need to be getting further into the bag.
>Nakul_Prabhu: EGIINSZ 11F SEIZING +94 286
>JD: ?AABIST O5 .ABITAnS +89 328
#note a lucky draw
>Nakul_Prabhu: EEY N9 EYE +30 316
>JD: AEIIOOT 12H TOO +20 348
#note an interesting position, the last blank is still out there but there is also a serious shortage of vowels. I was scared of the potential cheap QI play at 10J and wanted to take it out, quackle prefers OAT but every turn where I leave the Q spot open is another where he can hit it, and I felt like I could beat him on skill in an even game.
>Nakul_Prabhu: DEOVY A11 DOVEY +47 363
#note damnit, this isn't a word but I knew something like this was good (LOVEY# and DOVIE#) and the 5 points seemed like they would cost me some win percentage. But what I should've realized was that I was going from being something like a 80% favorite to just a 40% favorite to win.
>JD: AAEIILR C2 LIAR +31 379
#note the blank is out there and there are lots of consonants to fill in my vowels.
>Nakul_Prabhu: CIOR L8 COR.I +22 385
>JD: ?AAEEIR 13H AA +19 398
#note fortunate to draw the blank. the Q is the most important factor here but I'm now fine with drawing it. EA at B1 is very smart - creates a spot on column A where Nakul cannot play. Time was tight so I just took the points. The V is bad news too.
>Nakul_Prabhu: DEIV 2H VIDE +17 402
#note we post-mortemed this play extensiely, he figured he was blocking QI and he knew he had to get rid of the V as well.
>JD: ?EEINPR B1 PERN +36 434
#note this was agonizing since I had started to doubt myself on PERN#. actually my best play here is EVER at H1 (he still gets TALAQ# through ALA) but this was safe.
>Nakul_Prabhu: DEQST I1 Q.S +13 415
>JD: ?EI 13L sEI +12 446
#note even though I again made some significant mistakes, it felt good to play a close endgame and play real scrabble again.
>JD:  (DET) +8 454
#note by the equity numbers this was one of my worst sessions of scrabble of the year, but at least I walked away with 3 wins.
