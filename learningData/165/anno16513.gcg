#note Sorry I don't have the full game annotated. Chronologically, this one came first, and, as with #5, I didn't know I'd be doing a series around it. If anything, it'll just make the awesome play easier to find.

#note Quackle prefers LAR setting up the A, instead of ALAR setting up the T. (-3) 
>Opp: EPT J6 PE.T +12 24
>Carl: BERSTUZ 5H BUST +19 61
#note This play is so awesome that Quackle doesn't even consider it! Give it a chance, though, and it sims ahead of ZEBUS 12A and LUTZ F11. Notice the possibility of SPELTZ (a kind of wheat). All told, it's totally worth it to burn the S here. But there's more to it than that...
>Opp: EMNU H11 .UMEN +24 48
#note BUST may be awesome, but is it correct? Elise (slightly) favors BURETS 5E. I think I understand why this is. 1) BURETS scores 4 points more. Since the ER combination by itself is worth about 4 points, it's basically an even trade, especially as there are many Es left to draw. 2) Keeping bingo tiles isn't so important because I'm probably going to score 70 next turn no matter what I draw. 3)  BURETS is more defensive, restricting columns D and  E without opening column L. 4) BURETS turns over more tiles, seeking the blanks..... But there's more to it than that!
>Carl: ABEERRZ 10J ZEBRA +75 136
#note You might cringe at BURETS because it betrays that Z was the tile I kept-- no other letter would make BURETS a reasonable play! This is doubtlessly why BURETS outsims BRUTES. See, BURETS sets up a second spot for the Z at 4H. There are 48 5-letter words ending with ZE. Opponent cannot safely block SPELTZ because I'm reasonably likely to have an even better play at H1. But there's more!
>Opp: KNOTU 12A KNOUT +30 78
#note There's a large element of psychology in BUST vs. BURETS. BURETS is audacious; my intentions are obvious, but little can be done to thwart them. With BUST, the inference is much weaker; opponent is fairly likely to assume I kept three consonants, including a duplicate S.  An imperfect player is more likely to make a mistake after BUST, whereas after BURETS, a straightforward play at H1 is often correct, and obvious to any novice player, whether or not they understand the position. To that end, BUST may be correct after all-- against all but the best players.

#note Remember David Sklansky's Fundamental Theorem of Poker: Whenever your opponent plays their hand differently than they would have had they known what you held, you gain.
>Opp: Y H7 Y. +5 83
#note Whether or not it was correct, let's hear it for BUST:#2 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown! Give yourself full credit if you came up with BUST or BURETS, half-credit for some other Z setup.

#note Starting with KNOUT, the positions are all fake. I just wanted to make the game seem longer than three moves and I needed more space for the commentary.
