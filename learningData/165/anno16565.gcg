#note Yes, this actually happened. Joel said "interesting placement" and I fell off my chair laughing.

>Joel: ??EINOR H7 ..ERtIONs +95 124
#note This (combined with my previous blunder) *almost* put me on tilt. But there was still a whole game left to play.

#note My only intentional phoney of the tournament, I believe, and a timely one at that. BOGIE BOGEY BOGY, DOGIE DOGEY DOGY, FOGIE FOGEY FOGY, but only POGEY POGY. No valid plays come close.
>Joel: GK 9G K.G +30 315
>Rafi: ADEHIOT 10J HOED +36 319
#note This was a hard choice between HO, HOE, and HOED. My thinking was that it was unlikely for me to bingo on this board, so points and turnover for the esses (for EFS or a late setup) were the most important things. I really wanted to get rid of an I though, as there were 5 unseen. I didn't see PODIA, which is another good choice... the H spot will be open next turn a reasonable amount of the time, and PODIA dumps an I. On a 4-ply sim, PODIA wins followed by HO then HOED.
>Joel: ADIL 1K .LAID +27 342
>Rafi: AEEFIST 12K EF +28 347
#note FIE maybe? 4 fewer points to dump an I? I think EF is better, but it's close... the rest of the pool isn't vowel heavy so I probably will draw at least another consonant if I draw an I. Too bad SAFETIED doesn't take an S.
>Joel: BDEIST 15A DEBITS +36 378
#note This ended up being a big mistake, as BIDETS doesn't work well for bingos OR overlaps.
>Rafi: AEILSTU 14A EAU +20 367
#note Couldn't find a good fish... quackle wants me to fish but the only reasonable one is CAB, which hits UTILISED, MUSTELID, DILUENTS/UNLISTED, DILUTERS, and DUELLIST. One of the lanes is pretty much guaranteed to be blocked though, which cuts my chances in half. With the drecky pool, I thought EAU might be enough to outrun in the endgame... maybe I can get a play to the ED for 30+. Very hard decision... I might have played CAB if I saw how often EILSTU hits.
>Joel: ILNUV A9 UNLIV.. +12 390
>Rafi: EILNSTT 4J ..T +14 381
#note LAB hits TENSITY/DISTENT. Didn't see that as a possibility. I saw that the pool didn't play well on this board and hoped that I could conjure up a win with better endgame tiles. I did see S(HO)R(N) as a possibility if I drew an R, and thought that having OUTHOWLS as an option could help me eke it out. Against a perfect opponent, LAB might be best (25% win) but against a human, PIT might win more than 25%? Hard to say.
>Joel: DIIMMRY 2M ID +15 405
#note According to championship player, DIDY (threatening MIM) is the only win.
>Rafi: EILNRST J9 S..R. +23 404
#note I have a few wins here, including this play.
>Joel: IMMRY B8 MM +10 415
>Rafi: EILNT M5 LINTE. +9 413
#note Glad to eke this one out after a dreadful start!
