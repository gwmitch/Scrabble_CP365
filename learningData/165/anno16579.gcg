#note tough decision, I saw WUXIA at the bottom-right, but I don't think I can really afford not to take this spot for this many points. WUXIA does turn over an extra tile and get rid of the U, which is why I agonized over the decision.

#note I analyzed this position about as thoroughly as is possible. From my perspective, he has 16 racks that bingo on column A, 18 on row 14, and 12 that do both. The bingos that play on column A score too much for me to outrun. Therefore, I should attempt to block what I can and try to outrun row 14. YU at 10C blocks ENVYING, while still leaving 7/36 racks that bingo there (an instant loss). From there, I have to hope to draw tiles like the G, N, R, V or Y (MAUGER, AIRMEN, ARMURE, MAUVER, AREFY respectively). The total analysis is that I have a 53/72 chance of winning with perfect play after YU, although in reality it will be difficult for me to find all of my best plays under time pressure, and in this case I in fact failed to find my best play.

>JD: AEIMRUY E7 .YAM +26 431
#note the I and the Y were in the bag, the I is a loss, this is a tie that I missed...AREFY at 12K is the play. 7 better than mine.
