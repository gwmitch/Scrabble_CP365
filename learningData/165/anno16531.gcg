>Josh: ?ABIKSW H7 WAB +16 16
#note Good draw to start things off. Thanks to Mack for providing his racks.
>Mack_Meller: DEGILUW I8 WIG +18 18
>Josh: ?AAIKLS 6B ALfAKIS +81 97
#note didn't think anything could possibly score more than this. I didn't know the other 81-pointers, KALmIAS and KALIAnS. 
>Mack_Meller: DEEJLOU J6 JEED +40 58
>Josh: ALNRSYZ E5 L.ZY +32 129
#note I considered Z(A)NY, and the sim likes it better because of the -ISH and -ING hooks I didn't account for, and G(LAZY)

#note CAGE(R). I was only 99%

>Mack_Meller: AINRU 2A UN.AIR +22 182
>Josh: BEMNQSU A1 N.MB +33 290
#note I considered B(A)MS for defense.
>Mack_Meller: AINNORT K5 NO +13 195
>Josh: DEIQSTU 1F EQUID +47 337
#note I considered QUITE, EQUID and EQUIDS here. What made me play EQUID is the worst case scenario of D1 FLARING or something like that. EQUIDS is really worth considering because of the added defense, where plays starting at I2 are harder to obtain and 1L bingos going down don't play anymore. The downside is the fact that I don't have the S anymore. The 3 plays are simming extremely close, QUITE having a slight edge.
>Mack_Meller: AEGINRT B8 GRIE.ANT +78 273
#note I think that this is a very good choice by Mack. I held it, I'll admit.
>Josh: EHMSTTV C11 H.ME +33 370
#note Here I considered L4 VET, L4 METH and C11 H(O)ME. I wanted to get rid of the 3x3 threat. Another very interesting turn that is up for debate.
>Mack_Meller: ?AFHRTT D1 H.FT +37 310
#note Ouch
>Josh: EEISTTV H11 .IVET +27 397
#note I considered VET L3 and (R)IVET here. (R)IVET is simming exceptionally well, ahead of VET, and I don't know why. My thought process was that I didn't want him to have the occasion to fish for a bingo on lane 15, I wanted to score as much as possible and I saw the vowelly pool and wanted to threaten Mack with bingoing too. Not sure if this is right.
>Mack_Meller: ?AELORT N12 TOR. +25 335
#note Sick play.
>Josh: DEEOOST 6J ..E +10 407
#note Here I wanted to drop one, score as much as possible and threaten the most bingos. 9H (BID)E is simming best because I still have SOOTED L3 if I don't draw a bingo/if Mack bingoes and pluralizes JOE my bingoes I could drawn may not play. Another really interesting move.
>Mack_Meller: ?AEILOT O6 vIOLATE +76 411
#note If he plays F7 KA/ZA he wins if he draws the S. Otherwise he loses. 
>Josh: DENOOST A13 DOE +27 434
#note I obviously saw SNOOTED. But again, I was only 99,9999999% sure and I couldn't risk it. Other plays are better than this but it took me too long to calculate that this won, so I didn't look for anything else.
