>Josh: ?AELNOS 1D tOLANES +81 236
#note TWEAKER*!!! I jumped on this the moment I noticed it and then questioned if WEAKE(R) was a good play. Weird. Also, notable is 11E rELOANS. I didn't see (TOE)A.

>Ed_Liebfried: ?DEGNOS O8 DONGlES +88 390
#note NOODGES.
>Josh: CHIORSS 15H CHI +38 480
#note I should have looked harder. -12 to CHOIRS and I chickened out on CHIROS cause I was mispronouncing it in my head. I played quickly and told Ed I didn't want to waste his time. Not an excuse.
