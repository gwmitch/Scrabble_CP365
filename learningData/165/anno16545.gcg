>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEHNO -AEO +0 0
#note So a 2-ply sim likes 8F AEON best, and other AEONS as well before my play, and it also likes keeping EN more than AEHN. My thought process was that playing wasn't worth 8 points, and that even if my opponent scores less than 8 points more next turn, having a more balanced leave would largely make up for that. I kept the H and the A because they were for scoring if ever I didn't draw too well.

#note I kind of liked where this was going, although I had no idea how Jason played on low entropy boards.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEHINPR I6 PI. +19 30
#note hmm, I missed NI(G)H. That isn't that good of a thing. 
>Jason_Ubeika: DO 9F DO +14 36
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEHKN 10F EEK +24 54
#note Here I go keeping my handy AEHN leave again. I didn't like that he played DO for some reason. I didn't consider KNEE 10D, which seems quite worthy.
>Jason_Ubeika: ADEORST E7 ROASTED +78 114
#note Ah, that's why I didn't like DO
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHMNS 13B HEA.SMEN +86 140
#note I really hesitated to play this, but the longer it took me to play, the more likely it was to get challenged, and since I was unsure of it, I laid it down rather quickly. 
>Jason_Ubeika: ABFL -  +0 114
#note He took around 3 minutes to challenge, or something that felt that long. Every second felt like an eternity, but I knew that the longer he held me, the less likely he was to challenge. Turns out nothing happened as I expected, and the word was acceptable.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAGPSTY H12 P.AG +30 170
#note oooh, B9 APAT(H)Y is cool. I don't think it's the right play though. Better to take out the best scoring spot? Although 11G YAG does that too! The sim likes APAT(H)Y a lot, which I'm uncomfortable with.
>Jason_Ubeika: ABFL D5 FLAB +21 135
#note 12A FABL(E). Bad miss
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILSTY 12D Y. +20 190
#note too fishy I suppose? 12C AY(E) was also under consideration

#note I didn't know of VELAR(S). I looked for something there. Seems right.

#note I really hoped he would 3x3 after this cause this is ridiculous
>Jason_Ubeika: ?AEIOTT O1 TE.ATOId +122 299
#note I said "cool" after this play. It was genuine :)
>Joshua_Sokol: CHNOUVY 12H .OUCHY +34 425
#note didn't like NO(T)CH. This takes out the 2x2 anyway
