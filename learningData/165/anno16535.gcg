>Josh: AADGLPT H6 GLAD +12 12
#note This was already a difficult turn to start things off. I considered DAG, GAD, ADAPT and GLAD. I didn't like adapt because of its extensions and its leave, I didn't like DAG/GAD because of my lack of perceived options for next turn. I thought that even if he played GLADE or GLADY he wouldn't score too much.
>Greg_Heidler: ABOTU I7 ABOUT +20 20
>Josh: ACEINPT J10 PANIC +33 45
#note I saw PITTANCE immediately after I played. I missed H11 EPACT which is also really good.

>Josh: ??ERRRU G8 fURRiER +66 167
#note I guess I should have seen MUR(D)ERER. This takes S and Y, which I didn't account for
>Greg_Heidler: VY 12J ..VY +20 164
>Josh: AFGORRU L3 FRAG +30 197
#note FORA is considerable too

>Josh: AEGIPSZ F4 GAZE +36 326
#note I gave up on playing defense here, which was likely wrong.

#note Chickened out on PENATES here :(
>Greg_Heidler: ACEHOST A3 .ACHOS +36 295
#note Greg says this was probably his rack. In which case he missed ESCHA(L)OT, which I would have challenged I think. Ouch. He went over on this turn.
