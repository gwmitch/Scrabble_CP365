#note an interesting move, quackle likes yirr at 13L which would never occur to me. I played HORNY to be more defensive, but with the IN in hand quackle likes being a little more aggressive. If he plays through the R I get free rein of the bottom-left, and maybe even a 100+ point -CHING bingo or something.

#note row 15 looked dangerous, but in fact a lot of the letters that go there are gone (and I have the W). Should take the points for ONTO, which I saw but eschewed.

#note in response to an obvious fish, it seemed worth trying to force him to bingo opening a 3x3.

#note rosinate lowers his bingo percentage by about 5% and would've helped here specifically.
>Martin_Harrison: ADILNOR 2B ORDINAL +72 374
>JD: ADEILUW 1A LWEI +35 432
#note I think I considered UNLAWED and passed it up. UNLAWED takes out the most obvious lane and lowers his bingo percentage from 5 to 3%, but if he does miracle bingo I can't catch up, whereas with LWEI I should still be able to chase him down.
>Martin_Harrison: EV 13M V.E +12 386
>JD: AADDIUU 8A AUDAD +31 463
#note tough spot to empty the bag, but he doesn't really have plays that hit the N, and I block the bingoes I could see on row 7. quackle says he bingoes 3% of the time after AUDAD, I don't think I outrun him if I empty the bag.
