>Dave_Koenig: AEEILLO 8H OLEA +8 8
#note OLLIE#, a skateboarding term that originates from the nickname of an American skateboarder, is a decent option, but this is a bit better for vowel-consonant balance.
>Sammy_Okosagah: EEHKT J6 TH.EK +24 24
#note Interestingly, Sammy had another E here and passed up THEEK# 7G for 6 more points, because he did not like creating the big possibilities of six-timing the J or Z at 6J.  With both AKA# and OKA, there are many parallel play possibilities.
>Dave_Koenig: AEEILMV K8 .LIVE +24 32
#note I had trouble deciding here, as there were many close choices.  But after the game, Sammy said he liked my choice best.
>Sammy_Okosagah: ADEERTY 6G YAT.ERED +66 90
>Dave_Koenig: ACDEIMW 5K WAMED +41 73
#note WAME is not a verb, but it does have the CSW-only adjective form WAMED#, which I fortunately remembered correctly.  The extra point over MAWED will be significant.  I realized that this play was giving big scores back to him on row 4, but I needed to take the points, as nothing else with this rack was close to as good.
>Sammy_Okosagah: AEFT 4L FETA +41 131
>Dave_Koenig: ?CEIIQU 9B QUICkIE +71 144
#note The only other place to play this bingo at 7A is clearly inferior, because of easy plays to the triple making QI.
>Sammy_Okosagah: ABT 3K BAT +29 160
>Dave_Koenig: ADJNPRW H1 PRAJN. +69 213
#note This is the term for "supreme understanding" in Buddhism, and it is one of Scrabble expert and Dr. Ian Weinstein's favorite words.
>Sammy_Okosagah: BHIINST D6 INH.BITS +84 244
>Dave_Koenig: DILORWZ J12 WIZ +40 253
#note I did not know the beautiful CSW-only adjective WRIZLED#, which does not lose the D, which in retrospect I would probably slightly prefer over my play, but it's not a huge difference.
>Sammy_Okosagah: UX L12 XU +44 288
>Dave_Koenig: AADFLOR 4C ALFOR.A +34 287
#note Another cool J word ending in A.  This one means a saddle bag and comes to English by way of Arabic and then Spanish.
>Sammy_Okosagah: EEGP M10 GEEP +36 324
>Dave_Koenig: ?CDIOTU 2A InDUCTO. +74 361
#note I was tempted to play N12 DOUC# here instead of the bingo, but in the end I decided that the point difference was a little bit too much to sacrifice.  On the one hand, he doesn't have very big tiles out left to score with on A1 in response.  On the other hand, it allows him to score pretty well even with small tiles.  Also, it needs to be considered that with the board starting to get blocked up, if I delay I might regret not playing a bingo with the blank when I could.
>Sammy_Okosagah: EIMN 1A MIEN +40 364
>Dave_Koenig: INNOOOY 5E YO +28 389
#note This is an interesting moment.  My play doesn't seem to have a great leave, but looking at the remaining tile pool, I saw that I had a decent chance to draw into exactly the bingo that I did hit.  On the other hand, if I had played ICON E8, I would have set up a sneaky spot for BOYO, putting the Y next to the blank K.
>Sammy_Okosagah: AEGNORS 11B OR.GANES +68 432
#note One of two CSW anagrams of ORGANISE.  The other is IGNAROES#
>Dave_Koenig: GINNOOS 1G S.OONING +64 453
>Sammy_Okosagah: DLORSUV N9 LORDS +36 468
#note This is the best Sammy can do.  Any other play loses.
>Dave_Koenig: R A1 ..R +5 458
#note My only play to tie.
>Dave_Koenig:  (UV) +10 468
