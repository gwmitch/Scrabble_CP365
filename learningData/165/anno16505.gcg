>Joshua: GLO 8G LOG +8 8
>Josh: ADEIINW 7H WADI +18 18
#note I was pretty lost here. I knew I played the best static play but I had no idea if it was good. 
>Joshua: EOSTX 8K SEXTO +41 49
#note Meh, not that bad.
>Josh: AEEFIIN J2 FAINE. +20 38
#note Cool, this is phony. I should probably just go with 9F FIE.
>Joshua: AHM N6 MA.H +15 64
>Josh: AADEIOZ I3 ZOA +47 85
>Joshua: EPR K1 REP +24 88

>Josh: ?DEIINY 10N YE +34 147
>Josh: ?DEIINY --  -34 113
#note I feld I had to try it because I was confused. lol
>Joshua: R 5H R.. +3 108
>Josh: ?DEIINY 9F YIN +16 129
#note I didn't know what to make of his fish, so I just hoped to bingo back.
>Joshua: DEIORST 10H TRIODES +81 189
>Josh: ?DEEGIO 10D EGO +13 142
#note oh wow, 5F GE(RAN)IO(L). That's great.
>Joshua: FNO 11D FON +29 218
>Josh: ??DEIRU 12F DoURInE +72 214
#note I looked hard, but I have blank blindness. I couldn't see UntRIED, oUTrIDE and DUstIER, and I also missed UnbRI(EF)ED and UnR(EF)InED, although I wouldn't have played them. InDUcER is better than this to.
>Joshua: AHIO 13K OHIA +20 238
>Josh: AEMNRUY N2 MA +22 236
#note L1 UM. D8 RE(EF)Y. Both better than this.
>Joshua: EGV G3 VEG +16 254
>Josh: ENRTUUY -UUY +0 236
#note I literally chickened out of YURT. It looked so bad. I thought that I would have RE(GRAN)T next turn almost every time, which is why I decided to go for a bingo as well.
>Joshua: ACK 4D CAK. +20 274
#note I guess not.
>Josh: BENRTTW 12A WENT +34 270
#note I need to make something happen here. I'm not in a good position.
>Joshua: AJR N12 R.J +20 294
#note Good play.
>Josh: BORTUVY A8 VROU. +33 303
#note I jumped on this the moment I saw it. Blocking his setup is just a death wish. I need to score.
>Joshua: ABCEIIS 15M CAB +32 326
#note CEIBAS and BIAS are better than this. At first I thought Joshua should have played E4 (A)I, but I didn't realize that I would have been able to play my Q with QU(AI) or QU(AI)NT if I had drawn it.
>Josh: BNQSTUY E2 QU.NT +28 331
#note Only win. 
>Joshua: EIILPS 7C LISP +22 348
>Josh: BSY 14I BYS +18 349
#note I held him until I could make sure I would win after recounting, since I was only 99,99% sure of QUANTS.
>Josh:  (EI) +4 353
