#note I find it hard to believe that Quackle thinks TINSELS reduces opp's score by the most. I guess it's just marginal.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AAEHIUU 8M AHI +20 68
#note Gabriel said this was his draw. Jeez. He played this frustratedly, and instead should have exchanged keeping EH or AH.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EFGIRY F2 REiFYI.G +83 148
#note Oops, FERRYING.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AETUU 2A AUTEU. +12 80

>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: DIJR D1 J.RID +42 122
>Joshua_Sokol: AGOORVV C6 AVO +25 203
#note Aw crap, ARVO in the same spot seems so much better. I was afraid after playing AVO that Gabriel would at some point overlap making H(A) and that I wouldn't be able to block the triple lane he was opening.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: OPW 7M WOP +31 153
>Joshua_Sokol: GOOPRRV K4 GROOV. +20 223
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AAH B4 AAH +31 184
#note yup, this is what I feared
>Joshua_Sokol: EEOPRTU 10L UPO +18 241
#note I briefly considered 10K RUPEE but there is 0 reason to make such a dangerous play when S? are out. Maybe I shouldn't have opened another lane but I was starting to get a little bit worried that I would need to have a counter to his _HA plays
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: OW J5 OW +28 212
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEERTX 5D .E.ER +18 259
#note Trying to set up some points with my X. I really didn't like what EXERT did in terms of both my leave and the board's position afterwards.

#note (PI)NNACLED would have been awesome to draw. Also turns out its anagram is CANDLEPIN, which also would have played!!! Champ wants me to fish off my my N at G14 or my L at J5 whereas the sim likes my play. I wanted to avoid having missed something Gabriel could have had. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ADEIKLT B11 LEAK +20 390
#note -13 to TEAK. Gabriel didn't have enough time. He said afterwards that TEAK was so much better.
