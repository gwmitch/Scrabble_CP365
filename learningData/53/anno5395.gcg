#note so that's 3 "best" moves in 3 turns, according to Quakcle. this NEVER happens, so i'm going to enjoy the fact that i'm actually playing like i know what i'm doing.

#note i wondered if SATIRIZE took an R on the back. it does.

#note best according to the duck. 5 for 5. then again, its not like these moves are terribly difficult. i think i used 4 1/2 minutes of my clock in this game.

#note seriously, how is that not good? i call bullshit on the dictionary on that one. NoN(I)SSUE at 10B would have been pretty sweet. ah well, i'm going to win anyway.

#note nuts game. fun game. the fact that 10 of my 11 moves were duck approved is, well, unheard of for me. i'm sure i'll fuck it up the next time we play.
