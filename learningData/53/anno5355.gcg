>Joey: ADEILOQ 8G QI +22 22
>Noah: AEEHOST -OE +0 0
#note I didn't like HOE, but OE is probably fine. I liked exchanging because it seemed to put Joey in a tougher position.
>Joey: ADEFKLO H6 KO. +7 29
#note Not much to choose from here.  This seemed to limit his options the most.
>Noah: AEHJSTZ 6F JA.E +31 31
#note Quackle favors ZEK. To me, it doesn't look like the J would be so great after that. Leaving 4 consonants and no vowels is a drawback, but I liked setting up an S for hopeful points and keeping the Z.
>Joey: ADEEFLR 5I FEDERAL +77 106
>Noah: ADHSSTZ J2 HAZ.S +45 76
#note HADES is cool, setting up the other S, and also providing fewer Z comebacks, like...
>Joey: AEOOOSU 4J .OO +31 137
>Noah: DEEMSTX 6M EX +52 128
>Joey: ACEOOSU 2J .OCUS +20 157
#note Probably CHOUSE instead.  The board was getting pretty tight, so I didn't mind the inferior leave so much.
>Noah: DEEMMST I8 STEMMED +76 204
#note Scored as 77.
>Joey: AADEOTU H12 ODEA +29 186
>Noah: BEGIOSY 10F BOG.Y +25 229
>Joey: AINNOTU 11I .OUNT +19 205
#note Too bad this isn't a 16 by 16 board.

>Joey: AGIINOW A11 .WING +39 244
>Noah: AEGHITY L7 HAYI.G +28 340
#note Tsktsk to me. Chickened out on HYING and missed NIGHTY.

>Joey: AAEIINP 7L .IE +21 343
>Noah: EFLLNTU 3C F.LL +14 433
#note Missed TEENFUL, which looks better than anything else.
>Joey: AABINPR G2 BAP +17 360
#note I couldn't find any way to open the board effectively.  Even a miraculous bingo would fall a little short.

#note I knew it was either ETNA or ENTA*, but picked the phoney one. Doh!
