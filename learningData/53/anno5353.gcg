#note I looked at UNSEWING but figured it was no good.  I know UNSEWED and UNSEWN -- you may remember me posting on CGP a while back about how SAW, SEW, and SOW have the property of both UN...ED and UN...WN being good, while HEW and MOW can only be UN...WN -- but I figured they were just adjectives, not inflections of the verb UNSEW. Because of this game, I now know that of the SAW/SEW/SOW/HEW/MEW family, only UNSEWN/UNSEWED are verb forms; all the other -ED/-N forms in this group are adjectives.

#note I didn't know SWINGY, so I couldn't play the 7s. At least CINEASTE is the best 8.

#note Ugh. I convinced myself SCURVIE is good, before realizing at the last minute that it's spelled SCURVY, then I panic when I don't immediately see another bingo staring with S, thereby failing to see plenty of not-too-difficult finds such as SURVIVE, S(O)UVENIR, and STUIVER (anagram of REVUIST/VIRTUES).

#note You had shown your blank at this point.  I could have tried to block the triple lane but my leave would have been miserable.  Playing this gives me a 48 point lead, and I figure your bingo will be 80-90 points.  I'll concede the lead to clean up my rack and we'll duke it out the rest of the way.
>Tim: ?EEIMRS O2 SERIEMa +87 187
#note I saw plenty of double-double bingos but decided to take the triple lane instead, in case you have an S. I also choose a deliberately obscure word, hoping to draw a challenge.

>Tim: AHIIRSS M9 HI +20 298
#note I got bogged down in my own thought process again: I look at things like SA(S)H but decide to sacrifice some points to avoid leaving myself two I's. But instead of playing the simple HI(S) for 24, I stupidly play HI for 20 instead. And of course you play ZA(S) there in a couple turns.

#note Trying to be cute, setting up IF(S), instead of the simple and strong RI(S)KS. This is where I usually go astray -- overanalyzing and overcomplicating.  I have to remind myself to play simple, strong scrabble: double-check for bingos, look for hot spots and hooks, take the points when in doubt, etc. etc.

#note Things are looking bleak, but if I don't take IF(S) now, you might block the spot.
