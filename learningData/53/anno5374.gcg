#note MIX actually sims slightly better here: really, Quackle? SYRINX worth considering but I think MAX is best.

#note Quackle likes RIN G12, which seems like a weird play if I want to bingo next turn. Surprised it sims so much better than my play (5 pts). STIR 13G I can see, since it's really hard to block after. Don't think my play is so bad though, I think it's better than RIN or SIR G12.

#note Struggled a LOT with this play. Still have little to no idea what is right. I wanted to keep FO for a possible 15L play, and also have a small shot at bingoing 15A. I also thought plays like FAVE B12, Quackle's favorite, were basically game over. Maybe I didn't give enough thought to just outrunning Chris here, since there are some scoring tiles out. Not sure what I should have done.

#note Apparently VIRL 9K wins 2.78% of the time. Not sure what the draw is, as even drawing ET loses to a block of PROJET.
