#note One of those "I'm sure I'm missing a bingo" racks. The only playable one is from the S, a low-prob word I've never heard of (although maybe Lipe has), so I can't feel too badly.
>Matt_Robin: EIIRSTV I1 REVISIT +72 126
#note Missing the 9A placement?
>Jason: ?ELRTUV 2H R.VoLUTE +86 159
#note Dangerous, but since the next-highest-scoring bingo is 69, sims best.
>Matt_Robin: AQ H4 Q.A +45 171
#note Matt and I dealt with opposite problems here; after the game he told me his rack was the Q and six vowels (no U).
>Jason: MNNSTTY O1 T.NNY +27 186
#note Phony. Shouldn't have risked it. TENTY or NETTY do just as well.
>Matt_Robin: OPW B2 POW +32 203
>Jason: IIMSTTU J6 MI +23 209
#note Missing the cute MI(T)T, 7G.
>Matt_Robin: AEEGOPR A4 APOGEE +36 239
#note Clearly best. Matt said after QUA leaving five vowels he drew PW, scored with POW, then drew three more consonants. Hmph. My three-consonant draws Saturday seemed to always come with leaves like ?LRT. < / whine >
>Jason: INSTTUU L2 .ITU +8 217
#note Duck likes UNIT(Y) or a play I nearly made, TUTU at B9. Surprised this sims about 10 behind ... didn't think it was *that* bad.
>Matt_Robin: DDR 5K R.DD. +20 259
>Jason: ENOSSTU F2 ....S +18 235
#note I know the OUTENS anamonic is "ESTRANGED CUBS". I knew any seven in this rack could play. I was rattling off every OUTENS bingo .. except the one plus S. The closest thing I saw was OUTNESS*, which I couldn't play with a straight face. Having burned a lot of time on the SPHERULE miss, with Matt playing fairly briskly and me needing time for the endgame, I couldn't take too much time here. TONUSES. Damn.

>Matt_Robin: ADH 10D DAH +29 331
>Jason: ?EINRST 11E ESTRINs +85 325
#note Matt's play ensures my second blank doesn't totally go to waste.
>Matt_Robin: ATW 3K W.TA. +26 357
>Jason: AEEFIMO 1G FE. +24 349
#note No need to panic over the four-vowel leave: unseen ratio is four vowels to 11 consonants.
>Matt_Robin: DEIINRY H11 .EDRY +30 387
#note Matt's exact rack, which he wasn't happy with at the time, making me think I had an opening. Of course he couldn't play the superior RINDY (after which I win by four under optimal play) ... no, he has to do this.
>Jason: AEILMNO 13A MELANOI. +74 423
#note A fun not-but: My first thought, at Matt put this on the board to debate its merits: "MELODIAN*! No, wait, MELANOID!"
>Matt_Robin: BFIILNZ B10 ZIN.B +72 459
#note Wah!
>Jason: EG 1M GE. +11 434
#note *sigh*
