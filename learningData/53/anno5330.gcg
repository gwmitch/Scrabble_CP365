>Craig: ACIRU 8H AURIC +20 20
#note a bit of apprehension when Craig played this.  He noticed perhaps the -ULA -LED -LES extensions.

#note 0
>Craig: EOSZ L8 .OZES +32 52
>Jeremy: BEFGOST K11 BEFOG +32 50
#note -3.3 K11 FOB.  Quack thinks it's not enough points to risk exposing a TWS lane.  Funny when I was drawing tiles the last one I turned over was an O.  I was saying, c'mon A!
>Craig: DEIO 15K .EOID +24 76
>Jeremy: DMNORST H4 DORM.NTS +63 113
#note -0.2 h4 MORD(A)NTS.  My bingo is phony. I played the correct bingo, but then changed to the phony at the last second.  I hate H4 MORD(A)NTS.  It looks wrong.  Anyhow, this was one of two phonies I played this tourney.
>Craig: AIQU 11D QUAI. +28 104
>Jeremy: AEINRRY 12B RAINY +45 158
#note 0.  sets up a big hook for the next B or G, but scores like a mofo#.

#note Scored as 72.

#note This play scared the hell out of me.  I thought a triple triple was coming down.  Turns out he had one.  BANAU(S)Ic.

#note 0.
>Craig: AK 3I KA +25 341
>Jeremy: DEEIMOU B1 UM +18 416
#note -14.1 on Many Ply sim.  2J ME is the best at 60.33% to win.  I understand why it's better after seeing what Craig did.  My play is only 44.88% to win with the rich tile pool.
>Craig: H J2 H.. +15 356
>Jeremy: DEEIIOR 15A ROD +30 446
#note 0.  Nine minutes to figure out a play, but I can't block all the bingos on this board.  It is too wide open.  Just taking the points is best.
>Craig: ?ACELST 1D CAbLETS +91 447
#note One of eleven 91 point out bingos.
