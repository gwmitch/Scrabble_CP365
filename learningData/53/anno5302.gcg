>Jason: CEEHLNX 9H HEX +25 25
#note Tough call. (W)HENCE is a cute set-up, and seems to be Duck's pick.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ADRY 7H YARD +25 43
>Jason: CDEELNZ K5 ZE. +26 51
#note Not exactly getting max value out of my power tiles, eh?
>Elaine_Glowniak: GOR 6K .RGO +7 50
>Jason: CDEHLNT 5H CHE. +18 69
#note Uh, Jason? Even though ERGO doesn't take an S, it has a back hook. Almost a 30-point error, ugh.
>Elaine_Glowniak: QSU 10I SUQ +32 82
>Jason: DILLNOT 11K ILL +28 97
>Elaine_Glowniak: NOTW O6 TOWN +27 109
#note Yeah, *that* back hook. I'm sitting there going "if I lose this game, I can point to the play where I lost it."
>Jason: ?DEINOT M8 OuT.INED +66 163
#note Only playable.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ?EILPRY 13G REPLYI.g +66 175
#note Ditto. PYRI(C) may be better.
>Jason: DEENTUV 15H VENDE. +36 199
#note Sims best, probably because it kills both triples.

>Jason: ENOOSTU K3 OO... +15 244
#note I do get a little superstitious sometimes. For example, part of the reason I made this play is because I did the same thing against Zeigler in the previous game, Saturday: turn ZED to OOZED. "Besides," I thought looking at the pool, "it's very unlikely she can hurt me too badly unless she's got the J."
>Elaine_Glowniak: FFIJ L1 JIFF +65 290
#note Oh, (expletive).
>Jason: EKNSTTU 1L .UNK +45 289
#note OK, not too bad, though. I may have lost a bit of momentum, but it's still an even game, I have a great leave with a vowel-heavy bag and I'm a better tracker with a better endgame.
>Elaine_Glowniak: ANP G1 NAP +21 311
>Jason: EGRSTTT 3J T..T +14 303
>Elaine_Glowniak: GNU 14E GUN +9 320
#note A little disconcerting that she's playing off consonants with a vowel-heavy pool (and blocking the board's only bingo lane).
>Jason: DEEGRST 13A GED +22 325
#note Spent a lot of time on this play. Had I been more sure of DE(BA)G, I could've saved myself a lot of stress. ERG in this spot is clearly second. The problem with ERG is that Duck will be giving Elaine a lot of vowel-heavy racks in these sims; I know from her previous play she can't be very vowel heavy. Giving her an open E seemed like disaster potential; if she bingos and I don't have a bingo back it's game over. But yeah, DE(BA)G. Grr.

>Jason: EEERSST N1 .EST +16 341
#note Call the Pope. CP agrees with me on a tough pre-endgame play. Figured I had to block AI or OI there. This scored decently (on this board, anyway), gave me endgame tempo. Concerned that I'm only three up, but again, I have faith that my endgame's better.
>Elaine_Glowniak: AI 2G ..IA +12 350
#note Oh yeah, she gets almost as many for dumping AI there. Hmph.
>Jason: EEIORRS 10D ROSE +16 357
#note Best. Figured I was blocking her only out in two.
>Elaine_Glowniak: AILOST 15D LOT +9 359
#note Missing her only winning play, in this spot. Can you find it?
>Jason: EIR 14A .RE +17 374
#note (R)ATIOS blocks this and scores enough to win. Whew.
