>Matt_Canik: AEEOTUV 8H UVEA +14 14
#note Not really sure why I chose to play it here. Clearly dangerous for the s/l hooks hitting a DWS, but I didn't want to give up an easy 30-pt play on a DLS either. Idk. Quackle says UVEA, OVATE, and VOE are all about the same. 
>Ken_Kasney: ACEEFRS L2 REFACES +85 85
#note A sign of what's to come. 
>Matt_Canik: EEINOST 4L .E +5 19
#note Enh..... nothing plays and I'm always awful about fishing too much, but it's gotta be the right thing to do here, right? The duck also suggests OE for 9 but mneh, I get an extra lane here, I guess. 
>Ken_Kasney: ARTZ N1 TZAR +32 117
>Matt_Canik: EINOSTW 9B TOWNIES +64 83
#note Yeah. Only bingo, no real question here. 
>Ken_Kasney: LPU 8A PUL +19 136
#note Wondering why PUT/P(REFACES) wasn't played. Whatever. 
>Matt_Canik: AAADFIT 10E AFT +31 114
#note Someone very wise once told me to take points over leave in the majorite of situations, so I chose this over A(W)AIT/(PUL)A. Quackle says both are equal. 
>Ken_Kasney: ?DERSUX J2 EXtRUD.S +69 205
#note Meh. I THOUGHT I was catching up...
>Matt_Canik: AADILOW 10A LAW +19 133
#note I became so obsessed with trying to play WADI or something like that to dump a bunch of vowels that I entirely missed a number of better plays making NAW. ALOW was probably best. I fail. In my defense, it's the first real MISTAKE on my part this game. 
>Ken_Kasney: BIN 11C NIB +27 232
>Matt_Canik: ADIIOOT O1 OAT +28 161
#note Tons better than anything else, but DO(X)I(E) wins style points and a distant second. 
>Ken_Kasney: HOY K8 .HOY +25 257
>Matt_Canik: DGIIIOR I3 OI +14 175
#note Remember when I said someone wise told me to take points? Someone else wise told me not to exchange, and I decided to try and play through this. Quackle disagrees, saying 'change GIIIO'. 
>Ken_Kasney: AMP H1 MAP +33 290
>Matt_Canik: DGIIRSY 1E GRI.Y +11 186
#note At this point, I my primary thought is 'dump YI somehow to work for a bingo'. Well this is the only non-exchanging way to do that, and sims a close 2nd to CIG 6L
>Ken_Kasney: EEEE -EEEE +0 290
#note Maybe I'll catch a break. It was during this turn that I decided 'you know what? I want to win this game' and I started playing more recklessly. 
>Matt_Canik: DIJNSUV 11H VIN. +10 196
#note I don't know if LOWN takes an S. I'm sure he knows, but I need to take risks to try and win this game. VINY leaves JUS, and I figure I have a decent chance at a T for JUST 12A 50. 50 points sounds pretty good. VINY also opens a triple lane from the V which oculd net an easy 30 points, or the L back hook for a little extra help. 
>Ken_Kasney: H M4 .H +10 300
#note Interesting choice on his part. I figure he's probably NOT fishing for a bingo because there's no where for one to be played, which leads me to thinking he's fishing forsomething like LIQUOR 10A. That, along with the amont of points it scored, gave me the guts to play this. 
>Matt_Canik: DEJMSTU 12A JUST +50 246
#note We wrote down our scores, did our things, and then as soon as I pulled my letters out of the bag he groans and realizes LOWNS*. He seemed pretty upset about it, but what's to worry about? I'm still down 100. 
>Ken_Kasney: AIL A12 .IAL +33 333
>Ken_Kasney: AIL --  -33 300
#note In his frustration, he quickly sets down JIA. I'm expecting the O, but down comes the L. I challenge, and he's really kinda pissed at himself. Perhaps, maybe, I have a chance?
>Matt_Canik: BDEEILM A12 .IBE +39 285
#note Suddenly, bingoboy is back in it!
>Ken_Kasney: Q I10 Q. +11 311
#note My turn! I'm only down 26!
>Matt_Canik: DEEKLMN L10 ELK +27 312
#note Here's another benefit of VINY earlier. But that unseen blank is really unnerving me, which made me think for a while before playing here. But I really didn't have any points anywhere else. 
>Ken_Kasney: DEIL E1 .LIDE +14 325
#note He's clearly trying to set up a bingo lane with GLIDER/GLIDES/GLIDED. Bleh. 
>Matt_Canik: DEMNNOR 6A MODERN +21 333
#note This was tough. MODERN does well for blocking and pickng up some points, but VENOM scores a bit more. With his recent fish and the unseen blank, I assume he's at/near a bingo. I didn't know/see MONDE B2, which probably would have been a little better than this. Also possibly notable is BONDMEN, but I think the unseen pool makes that inferior. 
>Ken_Kasney: ?AGIR H11 .IRGA +30 355
#note Well, he didn't bingo.... but this essentially clinches it for him. 
>Matt_Canik: CDGINOT 14A .ODING +28 361
#note GG TY
