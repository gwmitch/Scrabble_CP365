>Rob_Robinsky: AEIJOPV 8E JIVE +28 28
#note Quackle agrees with the placement after 1000 sims.  Honestly, it comes down to who I'm playing and what I'm leaving.  I would go for 8G in a heartbeat if I had any of the hooks.
>Opponent: ?CINOTX H8 .XaCTION +101 101
#note EXACTION and EXCITONS are pretty close.  Personally, I prefer not to put an S of any kind to set up an easy plural to the triple.  OUTJINX is a cute alternative, though the bingos are better.
>Rob_Robinsky: AIMOPST 15B TAMPIO.S +65 93
#note I wrote down the alphagram, but APOMICTS sticks in my craw at least half the time.  I know it, I've played it, and obviously I've missed it as well.  TAMPIONS is second best though.
>Opponent: EMRRY I4 MERRY +29 130
>Rob_Robinsky: ABDNNOO E5 BAN.O +28 121
#note ABOON looks better, but I have serious reservations about DN as a leave.  Too many cheap extensions to BANJO, though...I don't need the volatility that badly yet.
>Opponent: OW F5 OW +30 160
>Rob_Robinsky: ABDNOTU H1 TABUN +31 152
#note Just completely missed ABOUT.  TABUN is second best, albeit far back.
>Opponent: GOOP D9 GOOP +17 177
>Rob_Robinsky: AACDORR B10 CARRO. +28 180
#note Quackle favors ORAD D3.  I guess I can see its point.
>Opponent: EEZ C11 ZEE +45 222
>Rob_Robinsky: ADDEELT 10F DE.LATED +65 245
>Opponent: HO 14E OH +30 252
>Rob_Robinsky: AFKLNUY 2F FL.KY +31 276
#note I shouldn't miss FLAUNTY.  FLAKY isn't very good anyway.
>Opponent: AEIILTT K4 TITILA.E +82 334
>Opponent: AEIILTT --  -82 252
#note The turning point in the game.
>Rob_Robinsky: AAEEINU M9 A.IEU +14 290
#note Knowing that I'm not giving up a bingo makes this look even better.  By far the best to clean up the rack.
>Opponent: AEIILTT K8 TI.I +8 260
>Rob_Robinsky: AENNRSW D4 NAW +26 316
#note AZON is favored by the sim, but I don't like holding a W against this pool.  Or in general, really.
>Opponent: EIL C2 LEI +8 268
>Rob_Robinsky: ?EHNRSU N3 UNHoRSE +61 377
#note My opponent has shown that he's reasonably close to a bingo.  I seriously considered playing AZON again, figuring that with the blank I should still be in good shape even if he fits.  However, finding the bingo that gives almost nothing back along column O is in my opinion best.  Any bingo ending in S or R gives back a ton of hooks...UNHORSE doesn't.
>Opponent: ADERTV 1J ADVERT +47 315
>Rob_Robinsky: DEFGINS 14J FIGS +23 400
#note Blocking QUASI wins the game.  Holding the S is worth risking drowning in consonants, even the Q.  I thought that it would be better to try to play for an outplay...I guess not.  FES I13 is Quackle's choice (and my rejection).
>Opponent: AEGIQSU L4 QUASI +33 348
>Rob_Robinsky: DEGN B1 GED +17 417
#note I didn't see his best outplay.  AZON saves 15 points of spread over GED.
>Opponent: EL G6 LE. +17 365
>Opponent:  (N) +2 367
