>Matt_Canik: FOORSTT 8G FORT +14 14
#note Maybe OFT. Idk. I liked the idea of getting FORT(IFIED) or FORT(IFIES). Call me Marlon. 
>Glenda_Short: AEIX J5 AXI.E +28 28
>Matt_Canik: EGKOPST 4J TOKE +29 43
#note Quackle is flipflopping between this and KEG K3. I liked taxite. 
>Glenda_Short: OV 6H VO. +13 41
>Matt_Canik: AEGMPRS M2 PR.GAMES +84 127
#note Nice. She didn't block it or anything. This is round 11, and this is only the 4th game where I bingoed first. All four games where I WAS the first to bingo, I won. And I went 4-8. Heh. I didn't miss any bingoes during that time though, so I guess it's partially just bad luck. But this game makes up for all the bad luck in the world. 
>Glenda_Short: AFJTTUY -  +0 41
#note She challenged. 
>Matt_Canik: ABMNNWY 8L W.AN +33 160
#note Completely missed WYN N6. Whoops. This is 2nd. 
>Glenda_Short: EIILR L8 .ILIER +20 61
>Matt_Canik: ABEMNOY 13I EMB.YO +28 188
#note AMBOYNA N8. See, it's plays like THAT that separate me from 2000-rated players. I still have my reasons for making this play (props if you know it)
>Glenda_Short: CLOST 10F COLTS +31 92
>Matt_Canik: AENNTVY O12 ENVY +47 235
#note Bahaha. 
>Glenda_Short: AAA -AAA +0 92
#note Yeah, bad luck on her part =\
>Matt_Canik: ?AENRTT 15H TEnANTR. +83 318
#note i saw this right away, and threw it down. It's not like me to see plays like this... I was proud :)  Also had eNTREATY and ATToRNEY. 
>Glenda_Short: IP K3 P.I +14 106
#note It was here that I realized that I was already up by over 200 and still had the potential to make it more. 
>Matt_Canik: ABIQSUU 14F QUA +34 352
#note Yay easy finds. 
>Glenda_Short: AFOR E11 FORA +27 133
>Matt_Canik: ?BEIISU D10 SIB +23 375
#note I thought about this for longer than I should have. I basically had the game won and SHOULD have started defense. But how often do I get to win games by 200? Much less 300? So I decide to keep myself a lane open and go for the 300-pt win. 
>Glenda_Short: AEEEU -AEEEU +0 133
#note :)
>Matt_Canik: ?DEISUZ C5 UnSIZED +86 461
#note Or upsized. Either way. Sorry, Glenda. 
>Glenda_Short: DLO 8A LO.D +21 154
>Matt_Canik: EGHNRTU 5B H.NGER +20 481
#note Well, HURTGEN is the name of a Call of Duty battlefield. But there's not many points to be scored here, and I feel kinda bad, so I'm just playing fast. 
>Glenda_Short: EEJ N1 JEE +30 184
#note Yeah, only one O left... I see what you did there. There's no way I'd actually block that play for her at this point... The way I've bagged her I have to let her have something. 
>Matt_Canik: AACETUW 15A ACUTE +32 513
#note LOL Yeah I was almost positive this was good. Whoops. WAUK L1 woulda been nice too. 
>Glenda_Short: O 1N .O +27 211
>Matt_Canik: ADGHINW F2 HAW.D +24 537
#note This and then NIGH for 14 was my original intent. Was shooting for high game, but at the same time on the board next to me Fran Silver was putting up a 5-bingo, 608 point performance. Oh well. 
>Glenda_Short: ADIILNU 3C ILI.D +16 227
>Matt_Canik: GIN O3 GIN +9 546
#note Eh, (BO)ING was 1 more. Big whoop. I'm 4-7 at this point anyway. 
>Matt_Canik:  (ANU) +6 552
