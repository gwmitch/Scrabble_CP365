>Joey: AEIMPUV 8D MAUVE +26 26
>Kenji: AFGJNUY H7 J.U +10 10
#note Joey had to win by 58.  MAUVE helps the board turn into a shootout on the right side, while MAUVE limits the top left quadrant.  Now the whole top of the board is in trouble.
>Joey: EHIIIOP I9 POI +15 41
>Kenji: ?AEFGNY 9C FAY +22 32
#note FEY is better.
>Joey: DDEHIIQ H11 HIDED +38 79
>Kenji: ?EGNSUY 14B GUErNS.Y +76 108
#note I'm not positive what the blank was.  It was either the R or the E.
>Joey: ACEGILQ G12 QI. +28 107
>Kenji: AEIOORW J9 OWE +38 146
#note Gin!  Losing this game by a lot seems almost impossible now.

>Joey: ABGILRT C12 GR.B +14 147
#note Rather weak.  I wanted to leave the A8 spot until I had a bigger play there, but LIBRA seemed good enough.  Better yet was BILAYER E5!
>Kenji: AEEIRRT A4 RETIA +30 221
>Joey: AAHILOT 8J HALO +18 165
#note Another big miss.  HIATAL scores a lot more and opens up more lanes.
>Kenji: EEFIRST 9L IF +20 241
#note Not all that sure here.  I'd like something more defensive than this, but I don't see anything.

>Kenji: AEEIRST N9 SERIATE +74 315
#note Now the outcome of the game isn't really in question.
