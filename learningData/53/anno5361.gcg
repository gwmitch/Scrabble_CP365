>Jim_Burlant: AABMOUY 8F BUOY +18 18
#note Whoops.  This was my first game of the day and I'm guessing the morning coffee hadn't kicked in yet.  8D BAYOU wins the sim hands-down. -13.  Nothing like vomiting away 5.5% winning chances on what should have been an easy opening rack.
>Spencer_Sun: EPTW 9H WEPT +21 21
>Jim_Burlant: AAMMNPW 7H PAM +23 41
#note -4.5 pts.   Sim winner is 7H MAW 24.   I personally thought that setting up my other M would be a good idea, but the duck doesn't agree.
>Spencer_Sun: ?EIINST F8 .rINIEST +63 84
#note Spencer spent several minutes on  this turn before settling on this.  I would guess that he had the same trouble seeing through the duplication in the rack that I would have had.   This play was incorrectly scored as 64.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGMNW 15F .WANG +27 68
#note Position is a virtual tie between 12C  MAWING and my choice, with the former nominally winning the sim.  My feeling is that if I don't take row 15 out Spencer certainly will on the next turn.  Since I don't have tiles to open another triple line, this was my choice.  This sims around 49% winning chances.
>Spencer_Sun: CLORV 13B CLOV.R +24 108
>Jim_Burlant: ?DIJMNU D10 JUD. +24 92
#note Best, even beating B10 JUICeD and B10 JUN(C)o in the sim.  Given how close the sim is, the lesson I'm inferring is that for 70 pts the blank should be burned, but not only 62 when I'm still in the game.  This choice sims at just under 53% winning chances.
>Spencer_Sun: ADRS K4 RADS +18 126
>Jim_Burlant: ?ILMNNQ 11C Q.I. +26 118
#note Took a while to find this play and it was a tough call about whether to take the points or exchange because of both the leave and the fact that it killed most plays down column B.   Ultimately, I felt 26 points were too much to give up.  This play sims best, just under 42% winning chances.  Note:  Spencer's last play makes it very clear he's sitting on another S, and from now until otherwise noted, sims are being run against an inferred S.
>Spencer_Sun: AKO 14H KOA +22 148
>Jim_Burlant: ?MNO 4I NO.M +12 130
#note Unfortunately I forgot to write this rack down and have no idea what it was. It wouldn't surprise me to find out that I missed some 8 through the A or the R.  Anyway, I didn't like what I saw going on w/the board and felt I should open a line for an easy 7.
>Spencer_Sun: ALS 10D .A.LS +23 171
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEELNO 3C ENnOBLE +77 207
#note Best, simming just under 55% winning chances.  
>Spencer_Sun: AY 2E AY +27 198
>Jim_Burlant: EGGIRUX 4C XU +31 238
#note Best - one of only two plays simming above 50%, the other being 3k GURGE.
>Spencer_Sun: EEIRRST 2I TERRIES +71 269
#note Sigh.  This tournament had been very difficult to this point...and I really had to gather myself to make sure I didn't let this get to me.  Regardless, Spencer is at 60% winning chances with this play.
>Jim_Burlant: EGGIINR O2 .NIGGER +30 268
#note I spent a couple of minutes on this turn debating the merits of fishing and felt that, if I fished, Spencer would play at 1M or 1N and the likely GAINER bingo wouldn't fit on row 13, and where would I be then?   Thus, I decided I had to play at O2.  While I was right to play at O2, Quackle punishes me quite harshly for burning the R, preferring SIEGING.   My concern was that with HH still unseen and Spencer having just drawn 7 tiles, playing anything ending in ING could have given him a 30-point play with one of the H's.  This choice, while scoring identically, takes a 9-point hit in the sim compared to SIEGING.  Is the second-to-last R really worth 9 equity points given this board?  The other options quackle prefers are F2 YOGI or B13 CIG leaving RINGE as the obvious bingo fishes. In any event SIEGING sims at 36%, and this play comes in at just under 29.  
>Spencer_Sun: CINOT 1A TONIC +28 297
>Jim_Burlant: DEHIIOT 13I IDIOT +23 291
#note Didn't know the first choice.  This choice is second best, at 24% winning chances.  First choice is DHOTI in the same location, simming at 32%.
>Spencer_Sun: AEU 10J EAU +13 310
>Jim_Burlant: AADEHLZ N8 ADZ +35 326
#note Saw HAZE 12-L and when I was calculating the score kept coming up with 36 points, not 46 which swayed my decision. If I'd scored it correctly I'd have played that in a second.  Anyway - I felt that if I wanted to win the game I had to prolong it as much as possible and that meant playing short.  Quackle does not like this choice at all, which sims at 37%.  I like this play lots more than Quackle does and you'll see why as the game unfolds...
>Spencer_Sun: EEV 11M VEE +20 330
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHHLR 12L HE +26 352
#note His V dump opened up a spot where I could play short and outscore him.  I had initially put down HA keeping the E, but thinking that I was going to play short I had thought I might need to keep the A just in case I had to play AH 2A.  I hadn't fully recognized the impact of this decision yet, but it proved very beneficial to me.    I was too fixated on lengthening the game to consider the better play of HER 11I, guaranteeing me an out next turn with HALF in two locations but I didn't see this.  Even with this imperfection, I'm also putting the onus on Spencer to make the right play...
>Spencer_Sun: EFIOT 11I FET +23 353
#note And he misses it.  IF 3L wins 100% and I'm helpless against it.  Fortunately for me he doesn't see it.
>Jim_Burlant: AFHLR M5 HALF +17 369
#note After double-checking my tracking and recognizing that he had out-plays both at 2A and 14M, I had to adjust the strategy.  After a couple of minutes, I found the win.  Relief!  Note:  Final score recorded as 369 - 367.  No recount was asked for.
