#note i was trying to decide what the easiest way for him to come back would be, and I decided that it would be easy to stick an X or something like that at 10B. he could also score a lot in the 4th row, but at least i'll be likely to have a comeback there. Quackle likes 4C TOW and  TWO better though. perhaps it's also the added antisynergy of the AO combination. (-4.5)

#note didn't see the very nice 3C WHINGE, but WHIG up there is fine too. I think I was just stuck on the COURANT hook. (-13)

#note i know that quackle won't like this move, but I am interested in trying to win at this point. can i really let that spot go? i do understand there are still bingo possibilities on this board, but I can have a comeback in the other two lanes. the problem with ID is also that it's a big telegraph to sam that i don't have the blank, which could lead him to a big exchange next turn as well. quackle prefers K4 DUCI.

#note C8 ERA sims best, or D1 AE. CARdIAE and CAvIARE are next. I think I wanted to avoid a disaster, but all these plays have a 100% win chance, so there must be no possible disaster. 12C AA has a pitiful 98.7% win chance. (-1.3)

#note quackle says -51 to just MI, since I will have an out-bingo with 6 out of the 8 remaining tiles, but i'm not taking this equity loss, sam can just block me. shrug. obviously XU is dumb because of melinite. when i looked at the log for the last sim (the AA move) it kept giving that as the only way i could lose, but it's assuming i'd miss melinite...
