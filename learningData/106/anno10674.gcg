>Matt: ?AFINVV J5 VIV. +12 12
>Andy: DEEILOT G4 ETOILED +64 70
>Andy: DEEILOT --  -64 6
#note TOILETED is the bingo here for Andy.
>Matt: ?AAFJNN 9E JNANA +19 31
#note And knowing his rack I give him ENTOILED/DELETION.  Lucky that he didn't find it.  
>Andy: DEEILOT E9 .OE +20 26
>Matt: ??AFHRU 7B cHAUFeR +68 99
#note Also FRAUgHt.  This drew the challenge, and I'm in good shape, or so I think.
>Andy: ABDEILT -  +0 26
>Matt: EEGILOY 12C GEY +28 127
#note N oreason to give him a 3x3, hence GEY.
>Andy: DE F7 .E.D +19 45
>Matt: CEEHILO 8C EH +23 150
#note Silly play, no reason to create an X spot now and let him back in the game.  I like CHIGOE now, which I didn't look for.
>Andy: EIL 5H LI.E +14 59
>Matt: BCEILOT H1 CIBO. +30 180
>Andy: BMU 9A BUM +21 80
#note Could have been worse.
>Matt: AELOQRT G2 QAT +31 211
#note Clogging lanes and scoring, but I don't clog well enough.
>Andy: EINORST 1H .OINTERS +83 163
>Matt: ELOOORY A8 O.OL +18 229
#note I should stick the E on, since the Y isn't really much of a consonant, and it's 6 more points.  Ugly.
>Andy: EOP 10A .PE +30 193
#note And know he's starting to climb back in.
>Matt: CEORSTY L3 TORY +22 251
#note Yeah, CORY over TORY if I'm gonna play here.  Thought it was important to take out that LIVE hook.  
>Andy: ADEGS M1 .GADS +30 223
#note Yep, i deserve that.
>Matt: CDEENSX 6I N.X. +25 276
>Andy: EKLMNNZ -  +0 223
#note He told me after that he only remembered NIXIE.  He was trying to challenge early and often so that he didn't get phonied to death in D1 that weekend.
>Matt: CDEERSZ G9 .DZ +18 294
>Andy: W 4G ..W +12 235
#note Well he's close to something.
>Matt: CEEORSW 10I OWE +17 311
#note Yuk, not great.  I like N1 ROW better, opening a second S hook is actually a good idea since I'm close to bingoing as well, and that scores 7 more.
>Andy: EL 12G EL +17 252
#note Uh oh.
>Matt: ACELMRS 11J EM +21 332
#note OWE blocked MARCELS from going down this turn.  I'm not sure what my goal was with this play, this isn't very good though.
>Andy: AEGNRST O1 .TRANGES +80 332
#note Uh oh.
>Matt: ACLPRST D11 P.C +11 343
#note He's been fast playing me, and now I'm starting to panic a bit, and thus make a stupid play.  This gives him PECK plays back, not to mention leaves the ADZE(D) hook available.  Quackle suggests SALP 13G, which I really like now.  
>Andy: IIKRU H12 .URK +24 356
#note We discussed this play after the game, he thought he needed the points, at the expense of keeping the I's.  I think LIRI or IRK is the play, considering there are still I's unseen.
>Matt: AALNRST 13G S.LTANA +34 377
#note I saw there were 5 I's left in 9 unseen tiles. then plunked this down in an effort to go out quickly, even drawing two I's I have IRIS.   Champ Player agrees that it's the only 100% win.
>Andy: ADIIIIO 14H .AID +16 372
>Matt: FIR 9K RIF +15 392
#note Needed a lot of fortune to overcome bad play in this game to say the least.  Spending so much time on early blank racks also got me in time trouble against a speed player like Andy is, and is a reminder why I like to play on the faster side myself.  
>Matt:  (OIII) +8 400
