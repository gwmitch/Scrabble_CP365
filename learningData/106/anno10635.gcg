>Jason_Randolph: AINOOTY 8H ATONY +24 24
#note After ~1000 iterations (all figures given are to 1000 iterations or so), quackle likes this choice 4th best, behind oy and yo by about 1.5 points, and toyo by .5 points. Admittedly io is a terrible leave, but I likes me some points. Speedy quackle likes this choice best, however.

>Momma: AEHV L4 HEAV. +28 28
>Jason_Randolph: ABDIJMO K3 JAMB +47 71
#note Jamb is clearly best, ousting job by 3.7 points.
>Momma: AZ M3 ZA +28 56
>Jason_Randolph: ADGIORT 9C GORDITA +68 139
#note Quackle prefers playing gordita here rather than over atony by 1.6 points. Perhaps the fact that so many a's are seen makes a painful counterplay off this placement to a8 less likely?
>Momma: ??EELRT E4 LoiTE.ER +74 130
>Jason_Randolph: AACGHLR D11 AARGH +28 167
#note After a bunch of iterations, quackle decides it hates this move, marking it 10th. However, speedy quackle puts it 3rd, behind galah and horal, two words i didn't know. (Yeah yeah, i know. High fives, Jason.)
>Momma: EFIWY 4A WIFE.Y +38 168
>Jason_Randolph: ACELPTU 15C C.APEL +39 206
#note Quackle prefers caph, but i think the e and l are worth an extra 6 points. Maybe the difference is on the counterplay?
>Momma: KNO A1 KNO. +33 201
>Jason_Randolph: DENRTUU 13B NU.TURED +74 280
#note Only bingo, best play by a long shot. Took me forever to see for some reason.
>Momma: BO F2 BO. +14 215
>Jason_Randolph: DEIOOTU 12I OUTDO +15 295
#note Ootid is a better play. Touted also sims higher after a bunch of iterations. However, it's so damn close it seems negligible.
>Momma: ACLS B10 CLA.S +26 241
>Jason_Randolph: EEGIOOS C1 GOO. +16 311
#note Bogie seems to pass up goof after a bunch of iterations. However, with 2 s's in the bag and the lead, I hesitate to open up a lane like that. Again, close call.

>Momma: EX A14 EX +29 270
>Jason_Randolph: EEEFIIS 13M FIE +22 333
#note Speedy player likes fie best, but after a bunch of iterations, it likes several choices better. Probably shouldn't open up a trip-trip like that with a lead late in the game.
>Momma: ELR O12 L.ER +15 285
>Jason_Randolph: EEIIMSW K10 WI.E +14 347
#note Wite seems to be the play here, edging out gem e14
>Momma: IST 5I TI..S +19 304
>Jason_Randolph: DEIIMRS G1 DIM +20 367
#note After a bunch of sims, this takes a very close second to id in the same spot.
>Momma: IQ 4H QI +23 327
>Jason_Randolph: EIINRSV 1G .IVINERS +89 456
#note Also inviters a7, but for 20 less points.
>Jason_Randolph:  (ENNPSU) +16 472
