>Jackson_and_Alex: BDENORT 9I BOD +19 19
>Hiba_and_John: ETU K9 .UET +10 26
#note School scrabble :).
>Jackson_and_Alex: BENORTT 10J B.T +23 42
#note Sigh, BENTO, BETTOR. BUT is third.
>Hiba_and_John: EHM 12K .HEM +18 44
>Jackson_and_Alex: AEKNORT M5 KAROTEN. +70 112
#note I love school scrabble. It is the only place ain which you can mercilessly phoney after you've established the fact that you know a bunch of words.
>Hiba_and_John: DS M5 ........D +28 72
>Hiba_and_John: DS --  -28 44
#note Firstly, they think of putting the S on KAROTENE, which would be quite satisfying to challenge. Secondly, they play KAROTENED. I don't know what the logic is. 
>Jackson_and_Alex: AAEGLRZ 8L Z.EA +69 181
#note Yeah we're really  luckbagging. 
>Hiba_and_John: DS 10J ....S +9 53
#note They wronly assumed that if the word didn't take the D hook, it couldn't take the S hook. It was actually good that they reasoned that though, as it led to another play that didnt' get challenged off. 
>Jackson_and_Alex: AGILLRR N2 GLAIR +26 207
#note GLAIR over GRAIL because of challenging possibilities. 
>Hiba_and_John: DI 2L DI. +5 58
>Jackson_and_Alex: AEELMRT 1G REMETAL +86 293
#note Saw METAL/THEME, but sir greedyguts wants his bingo...
>Hiba_and_John: NTU N12 .UNT +12 70
>Hiba_and_John: NTU --  -12 58
>Jackson_and_Alex: ?AEFIJR O11 FERIA +38 331
#note Wow we are getting inordinately lucky. My logic with this turn was: 38, largish J play, bingo. Probably faulty logic, but It turned out well. 
>Hiba_and_John: NQTU 14N Q. +22 80
>Jackson_and_Alex: ?AJLUVW 6J JAW.. +31 362
#note I apologize for phoneying overboard, but we wanted to make sure we met the 250 spread cap as it was a 4 game tournament. I don't personally consider phoneying poor sportsmanship, but i'm sure many disagree.

>Hiba_and_John: CPTY E1 C.PY +11 95

>Hiba_and_John: CT B1 C.T. +6 101
>Jackson_and_Alex: EINOORW 7H OW +26 503
#note Between OW, DOWNIER, and DOWIE, I like OW because of the bingo-prone leave.
>Hiba_and_John: ADR 10D DAR. +7 108
>Jackson_and_Alex: EINOORX 11D OXEN +49 552
#note Oh, we missed EXO(D)OI. I feel we are misplaying many turns in this tournament. This turn was between (D)OXIE, OXEN, OX, and OX. 
>Hiba_and_John: ST D10 ..TS +10 118
>Jackson_and_Alex: EIIORVY A4 .IVEY +36 588
#note Had they not played (DO)TS, we would have played REVY underneath OXEN =). DIVEY over DEVOIR because DIVEY scores 6 more and gives me the adrenaline rush of a phoney. I think I am starting to feel bad now. 
>Hiba_and_John: NPU 13A PUN. +12 130
>Jackson_and_Alex: ?IIIORS L12 .I +5 593
#note Gosh, I haven't luckbagged so hard in a long time. HI has the HIghest valuation. It also bingoes the most. 
>Hiba_and_John: AEGILOO A13 .IE +15 145
#note Having not tracked, they didn't know we had a bingo. I guess they could have deduced it from our last play, but it really doesn't matter at this point. 
>Jackson_and_Alex: ?IINORS 14F SIRlOIN +66 659
#note In the last game I didn't write down my racks. We won by 391 (phoneys F(R)EEaBLE (thought it was good, turns out only REEFABLE is good in abeeeflr) and HOH :D). Total 4-0 + 1293. 
>Jackson_and_Alex:  (AGLOO) +12 671
#note Round three, Toronto School Scrabble Championship, 2-0 + 376, after this game 3-0 +902.
