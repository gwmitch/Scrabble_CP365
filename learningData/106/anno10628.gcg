#note my hesitation was warranted, especially with the exchange two. QI is better. however, the sim assumes he'll see NIZAMATE, which is not 100% true. (-6)

#note i insta-played QI, but J6 FEZ is worth serious consideration too. (-1)

#note crap, what do i play? L11 FIX looks cool after his move, i think. (-0.5)

#note ok fine i give up
>cesar: EINOORU 11C ROUEN +18 195
#note NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. 11B OURIE probably looks better but i don't want to give up another high scoring play. 11C ROUE may be a little better than my play. best of all is exch OOU which i didn't really consider. my win chances are really low now. (-0.5%)

>cesar: ACEORUV 3B OVERCU. +26 309
#note difficult situation here; VACUA 4D has to be better than OVERCUT because of the leave and turning over less. i bingo a lot more often. another blunder... (-3.5)
>bruce: EKP D1 KE.P +30 404
>cesar: ABDLUVW H12 ..A +6 315
#note awful situation here. i have to block both lanes. since spread is important in the tourney i need to block the bingos in either direction and i couldn't figure anything else out. any ideas? quackle likes just playing 1A BULK. one of the problems with AHA is that SANDALED is still playable, so BULK is fine.
