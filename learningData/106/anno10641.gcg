#note Wow I really suck. I didn't look for too long this turn as I felt the game was one no matter what I played. I sacrificed 1-8 points with a variety of plays like OR(G)IaSTS, (E)STRIOlS, (E)ROTISmS, and STORIeS/its anagrams, played with SMATTERS.
>Lee_Fingold: AISV J12 VISA +23 168
>Jackson_Smylie: ABDEMNO M5 B.MOANED +66 386
#note At first I was sad because there was no H for HAMBONED, but then saw bemoaned! I think I really rushed on these last two racks, not stopping to look for the (obviously) better placement at 4G/7D. Yuck, 14 points down the drain.
>Lee_Fingold: FUZ F3 FU.Z +36 204
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIIIOR 12H .E.IE. +20 406
#note Everything wins 100% of the time except for (V)OI(D)ER, which I almost played. I decided against it because of the (slight) possibility of a triple triple. (L)E(V)IE(D) is best, and best for style points :).

>Jackson_Smylie: DIIOQRV 8L V.ID +36 442
#note I have two spots for Q(I), so I'm not worried about being stuck with the Q. An interesting option I didn't consider is (A)VOID off of the A in VISA. As there are no S's out, it does not open up the triple lane, and It gives me a spot to play QI for 39 rather than the 22 in the other spot. V(O)ID's Valuation is higher though.
