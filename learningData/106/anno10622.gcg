#note This would have been a painful orphan in Collins. Anyways, I should do VOIDED here. I guess I misevaluated the danger of letting John possibly hook it.

#note I need to train my brain to think of clever setups. C3 VAGINA is really tricksy. Sure, it could go horribly wrong, but it's not like FGNV is foolproof.
>John_Stardom: INTW 1F .NWIT +24 50
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BFGKMNV F7 F.NK +26 100
#note Sim gives a slight edge to trading. Meh, I think FINK is worth it.
>John_Stardom: AEERU 10B EURE.A +12 62
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABCGMNV 4D C.MB +20 120
#note Bad. I missed the star play VOCAB and nothing else is even close. Big error.
>John_Stardom: ILOOPST 2I TOPSOIL +78 140
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABGGNSV M1 B.NG +14 134
#note I saw GOBAN, but I forgot about GOBANG. But the play here is probably N1 VIG, which makes a lot of sense. I was not sharp this game at all.

#note Turned down AVOWS because it seemed too easy to kill the board after that. Also... was I really holding onto this V since turn 2?
