#note oh goodness. i calculated the 75% win if he doesn't have ROSEOLAR (well at least i think FIB wins the rest of the games, with enough time on my clock), but then i didn't want to lose to roseolar.  so i go and play this, which i was pretty sure was good (i would certainly have to be more than 75% sure, although i could have also acted irrationally)
