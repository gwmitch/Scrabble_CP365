>cesar: ?EEEIIT J13 TIE +7 92
#note i need to learn when to give up. obviously, opening two triple-triples with a blank in hand may win more games than not doing so, but this leave is too crappy, it's not going to work. 3J TINE keeps the V open and scores more. also TIE gives a lot back. however, the two moves are very close in win %... is there a better, less ridiculous fish?
