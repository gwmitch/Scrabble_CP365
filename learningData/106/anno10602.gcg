#note Not sure why ZOWIE F10 is so much better. FFU can't be that much better than EIOW, can it?

>David: ENRVX H4 VERN.X +20 61
>Mike: AEIIORS A12 .AIR +21 125
#note AIRWISE A9 sims a fair bit better; given that it's only the first S of the game, that seems reasonable.
>David: IORSTUV 5A VIRTUOS. +72 133
>Mike: EEILOPS A5 .OILE +24 149
#note PORE 6F is simming a little better; I think it's a little too desperate to leave the triple line open at this score.
>David: AEH 4F HA.E +17 150
>Mike: AAEIOPS C3 PA.EO +16 165
#note APORIA in this spot is better; didn't see it.

>Mike: AACEISS D2 CAS. +26 213
#note CESTA, of course. Actually, ACTA C3 leads the sim, but I disagree; the doubled S feels like a real liability. I'd play CESTA.

#note How is playing this at 1E more winning? I need the points, and I basically need to leave the Q in the bag for David.
>David: DEELNRT N8 .NTLERED +72 446
#note Even if the Q is in the bag, this (or anything, really) wins.
>Mike: EEGHINQ 1I QI +24 336
#note NEIGHED 15H, not that it matters. *sigh* While I don't feel like I blew any games outright, I just wasn't completely sharp when it mattered.
