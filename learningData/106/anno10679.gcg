#note Quackle likes FIQUE, but there's no way I'm leaving NWW. Tough rack. Besides I might be able to play it next turn!

#note Not really sure what to do here. I wanted to at least create another bingo line, albeit a weak one. Quackle really likes RAJA/JUN.

#note Might as well go for broke. This or LAKER 4A rate best. I don't really get LAKER because he can just play through the L and I'm not going to score enough bingoing through the other one.

#note Here's the important position. I found afterwards that GO/JO will work (well it won't win, but it will be close) if I can try EH/EO. Quackle claims that the only move that has a chance of winning is RAJ, which I considered, but that tells Rob my complete rack, and he can simply block my best scoring bingo. For example if I hit THRONGS/ELKS he can block with SLY.
