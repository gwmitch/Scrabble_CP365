#note Or WOG, but I liked that I got points and didn't give as much of a spot back for Robin.

#note And just like that, the power tiles were gone.

#note Wasn't really sure what else to play. Though this is volatile, it's equity is just so much better than anything else.

#note I saw the next best plays of TOYISH and HIE, but I wasn't willing to sacrifice so much to play them, especially since they left plenty open too. While this isn't what I'd prefer to do, it seems necessary.

#note I thought CORGIeS was good, so played here. I really should know better by now, since I've played CORGIE* against Dave Wiegand (it was challenged off). Turns out she missed GRaCIOS(O) here, but this seems like a fine play anyway. One option is something like FET N7 to set up the Y. Though she would take the lead after playing something like CRaGS, I would have the better leave going into the pre-endgame. I thought of FET, but insisted on blocking the "bingo."

>Noah: AEFFIRT A6 FI. +7 426
#note It looked like her only win was CRUSTInG/RUCTIONS. I could play (dO)FF and hope to draw the P for DIPTERAN if she plays CRUSTInG, or I could do this and hope she doesn't find RUCTIoNS. Perhaps the other option was better; I'm not sure.
>Robin_Levin: ?CIRSTU 14C RUCTIo.S +68 445
#note Turns out there is a play that both of us overlooked: ICTeRUS! 
>Noah: AEFPRRT B2 PRATE +25 451
#note Missed FRET 15A.
