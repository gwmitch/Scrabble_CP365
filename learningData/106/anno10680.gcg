#note i just held forever and this was so ridiculous that i had to challenge. i was reasonably sure that it was a word but to have such ugly letters and the perfect letter for a bingo seemed like there was a bigger chance i was remembering wrong. (-39)

#note the problem wth me is that i will plain just get frustrated and run down the clock and make some random move sometimes. i was already super low on time here and did not like 3A OKE.. come on, that's not going to work and is ridiculous. missing C3 KHET is ENORMOUS but i actually think i saw it.

#note it is still important to keep scoring. by playing TOEA i've committed myself to bingoing to save the game. 5D EAT keeps a bad leave but keeps up the pressure. who can stomach making a play like that, though? ugh. this game is hard. (-8)

#note quackle likes C12 IOTA best, i disagree. it's easy for him to kill the lanes with a parallel play and hope i don't get anything through the M. or play something like AZIDES. bah. (-10)
