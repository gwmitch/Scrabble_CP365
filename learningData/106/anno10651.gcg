#note This game is a good example of how small errors accumulate and make a big difference.  I don't manage a consonant heavy rack as well as possible for several turns and it ends up coming back to haunt me.  This play seems reasonable because I am setting up the S for big plays from 8L-O, but in retrospect I like playing long with TSADDIQ better.  It avoids consonant trouble, blocks bingo lines, and digs farther into the bag with both blanks still out there.

#note This is a situation where my lack of CSW knowledge let me down, but even sticking to TWL words, I probably should have played something like NESTLED 15B just to score more points and get myself out of consonant trouble once and for all.  My favorite play here is LEDDENS# 15B.

#note 9B TWIN was one point more, but the important thing to take out of this is that rack mismanagement on the last couple of turns essentially lost me a turn here.

#note I completely forgot about LUR#, and it cost me on a few turns of this game.  FLUB B10 is the star play here.

#note As on the last turn I had a much better play of FLIT B10.  I was intentionally holding onto BT in hopes of drawing an E for TEABOX, but FLIT does that also, while scoring better, holding the S, and playing off an extra consonant.
