#note I smelled the weakness of this play, but I just couldn't see the other option. I even knew, as I played the C, that I should have played the G instead. Ugh.

#note Oh, I know he's up to something sneaky.

#note YOU KNOW HE'S ABOUT TO BINGO!!!
>Winter: ?AEIINO 13B IO.INAtE +70 358
#note Didn't really want to bingo, but I couldn't score otherwise, and I knew this guy was going to hit it. Had to hope he had missed the bingo somehow, or that I missed the Q.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?EIKNST -  +0 314
>Winter: AAILMQT -  +0 358
#note Obviously he's trying to duck the Q, no point in letting him bingo out. My only hope is that the K is in the bag, because I think I can stick him.
