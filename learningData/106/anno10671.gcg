#note Tough call here.  There are a bunch of close plays.  This is no automatic bingo on the next play, but I kinda liked this for setting up various ways of fitting a seven.
>Matt_Bernardina: AEINNST J3 INANEST +67 81
>Dave_Koenig: ADELMPR 6B PALMED +26 37
#note I wouldn't have known IMPARLED# even if it fit.  Your mileage may vary here, but I liked playing long to assure an open board for a while.
>Matt_Bernardina: AHN 5C NAH +30 111
>Dave_Koenig: ?BEIMOR K9 EMBROIl +72 109
#note Damn, I had a nice bingo here.  IMBOWER 4B.  Tricky to spot that MNA#.
>Matt_Bernardina: AAGY 15G GAYA. +24 135
>Dave_Koenig: ?BEEEVX K4 EX +38 147
>Matt_Bernardina: COV D2 VOC.. +20 155
>Dave_Koenig: ?ABEEIV L2 VIBE +38 185
#note BIVIA# would have been nice here if I knew it.
>Matt_Bernardina: AAGLRST 14B GASTRAL +85 240
#note Yeah, it's TWL and I should know better than to challenge.  Clearly I'm rusty.
>Dave_Koenig: ?AEIOOS 12I OO.IE +10 195
#note ONOS 6I scores enough here to be worth burning the S perhaps.  On the bright side, my play does create some nice lanes.
>Matt_Bernardina: NZ 14J Z.N +63 303
>Dave_Koenig: ?AAIRSW M7 AWAIt.RS +87 282
#note There is one other very impressive bingo here that scores a little bit more.  I won't spoil it for you.
>Matt_Bernardina: PUY 13A PUY +29 332
#note Strange that he did not play this at 15A for three more points.
>Dave_Koenig: CFJKLRW 3C J.WL +28 310
#note Why not JOCK?  Because I was fishing for the word I played next.
>Matt_Bernardina: ENRU 12C RUNE +14 346
>Dave_Koenig: CEFKNRT 3I F.K.ER +48 358
>Matt_Bernardina: GIT 8L T.IG +27 373
>Dave_Koenig: CIILNOT A8 INCLI. +33 391
#note This one got a long hold from Matt, but no 10 point bonus.
>Matt_Bernardina: U I12 .U +3 376
#note At this point things are looking very shaky for me.  I see that he may be close to bingoing off the C or the G, and that I'm likely to eat the Q.  Plus I have very little time left.
>Dave_Koenig: DEHOQTT B8 DOH +35 426
#note Maybe OH is better to save the D for later?
>Matt_Bernardina: EEIOSTU C9 OE +15 391
#note These endgames are tough, because I want to hold onto enough tiles that he can't slow play me to death, but if I go to slow and he goes out right away, it might be enough to win.  I couldn't see any outs for him with the time I had left.
>Dave_Koenig: DEQRTT 10A ...R +9 435
#note The idea was to deke him into spending his T there, so that I could play AXED and then TAXED.  But this should lose.
>Matt_Bernardina: EISTU E11 U. +4 395
#note ETUIS 11E wins!
>Dave_Koenig: DEQTT 5J ...D +12 447
#note Now I'm safe.  He'll get one T spot, and I'll get the other.
