>XP: ??DENNY 7E DEY +28 40
#note XP's actual rack. While he had bingos here, this isn't too bad.
>Noah: AAGLNRR E3 GRAN. +14 45
#note Contemplated GARLANDER*, but wisely decided against it. 
>XP: ??AENNU 4A UNdE.rAN +66 106
>Noah: AABILMR A4 .MBRA +27 72
#note Lots of plays to choose from here. Didn't notice ALBUM, although there are some good aspects to this, like opening up the bottom of the board. I could potentially play ALBUMINA, which he might not know. Wasn't a huge fan of BAM, but didn't see AMBARI or BAALIM, both good options, of which AMBARI seems better. This isn't a bad play.
>XP: AHJ B8 HAJ +34 140
>Noah: AEIILNU 11B ILIA +22 94
#note Quite poor. Saw INIA B3 and UNAI C6, but not UNAI at B3 or ENNUI B2, which are significant improvements over this.
>XP: ETTX 3G TEXT +25 165
>Noah: ELNOSTU 2F LUTE +21 115
#note Seems like I could make some waves up top some f the time. Quackle suggests TO(L)U, UMBRAL or YOWL. I didn't really consider fishing, but ENOSTU is a good leave to fish to. TOLU doesnt seem too bad either. I'm not sure.

#note Another suboptimal play. Saw NANNIE but didn't think it was good.

#note Not quite sure what Quackle is trying to say here. Apparently GORY wins 43% of endgames and this wins 23%? I think Championship player is a little generous for both of them!
>XP: AENPTUV 15H NAV. +30 362
#note Best is to V-stick me, but XP just needed a win. This is matchplay, spread doesn't matter.
