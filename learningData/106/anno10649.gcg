>XP: ABOV L4 ABOV. +20 20
>Noah: ADIRTUX 7I XU +36 102
>XP: ?ACEEHN 6J HA. +28 48
#note XP's full rack.
>Noah: AADIIRT M2 DITA +16 118
#note Seems like he has a good rack, so I didn't want to be too agressive with something like RADII or ABRI. I thought of STADIA, which is defensible here.
>XP: ?CEENRT 5D CENTERs +72 120
#note CENTREs plays at N1 for 86!
>Noah: AIILRRT H1 TAIL.R +21 139
#note Should play AIRIER here. Also, RICTAL is good! Now I finally know what Robin was thinking of when she played RICTIC against Zar at the Orlando Nationals!
>XP: EGOOSST C5 STOOGES +70 190
>XP: EGOOSST --  -70 120
>Noah: BIILMOR D1 BORI. +24 163
#note Blocks GOOSIEST. Didn't see IMBROIL*, which could have been a good attempted phony.
>XP: EGOOSST C2 GOO +17 137
>Noah: AAHILMW B1 HAM +29 192
#note Well, I obviously can't just play SAHIWAL here. This seemed a reasonable alternative, though HWA(N) seems alright as well.
>XP: EISSTZ 9F ZITS +31 168
>Noah: AEIILVW M8 .WIVEL +32 224
#note I know he has the S, but I can't sacrifice too much here. Gotta play SWIVEL.
>XP: ENQRSUY 12K QU.RY +42 210
#note XP's full rack.
>Noah: ADINNRY O8 RIND. +27 251
#note I thoguht the ANY would be a reasonably good combination in the coming turns, and also liked blocking the potent scoring spot on column O. 
>XP: EENNS N1 NENE +19 229
>Noah: AENPSUY O1 AY +28 279
#note Didn't quite like playing PAUSE here. Maybe I should have played YUAN 10D instead of this.
>XP: EIMOSTU 14G TIMEOUS +74 303
>Noah: DEENPSU 15H DUNE +32 311
>XP: AGP 13H GAP +23 326
>Noah: ?EEEPSW F2 WEE. +15 326
#note Strongly considered ES as well, but I think I should try to block scoring spots, since the pool is good for scoring, and keep a good leave. Hopefully he doesn't have the D so I can get ES next turn if necessary.
>XP: JN 10L J.N. +13 339
>Noah: ?ELOOPS A1 OS +26 352
>XP: CDEGKOR K2 KEG +13 352
#note XP's full rack.
>Noah: ?AEFLOP 10D FLAn +23 375
#note Got a little worried here. This is a fine play, though there are certainly better ones.
