>dacrON: ABITUUV B4 TUBA +21 201
#note (B)UBU is nice, but I figured I could give myself a quick comeback if he hit the EM spot, take it out partially, and score a few points. Quackle agrees.

#note V(U)L(G)US 6D looks to be the play. Can't say I knew it. Can't play (O)UZO, sry Quackle.

#note Glad to see him play there - I still couldn't take it
>dacrON: CIKLOTZ H12 .OCK +30 286
#note (HEM)LOCK! I look at the spot, but couldn't find it. Also blind to (R)ITZ, which is also better. I figure with just ? left, I should try to keep scoring, and this saves (C)OZ for next turn.
