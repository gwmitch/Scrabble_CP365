#note taking the points with OOTID is best. (-2.5). also, some slightly better exchanges, such as keeping ADT or ADIT.

#note i need to get into the habit of writing down all my racks, or at least trying to reconstruct ones i may have missed after the games. i think i had the J too.

#note geez cesar WRITE DOWN SOME RACKS. maybe the best plays are that obvious, but you never know what i may have missed. i did have the J but not the i, as I mildly lamented not having BIJOU.

#note i thought i had made the dumbest play ever here, but i was not that big of a fan of 11C JIAO. first of all if i draw the T i have a big play at E9, and the J seemed worth trying to score huge with. JIAO is also giving back a big play. this was another tough situation. (-1.5)

#note ugh, that is bad. this play would be ok if VROOM weren't a word; i just gave that spot a cursory look. i saw 10B IVORY which is better too. (-23)
