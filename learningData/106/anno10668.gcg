>Tara_and_Derek: ALTUV 8D VAULT +24 24
#note Round two, Toronto School Scrabble Championship, 06/03/12. I am currently 1-0 + 374. 
>Jackson_and_Alex: DEFMRSS E7 F.RMED +24 24
#note :( no fremd. F(A)RMS, S(U)RF, F(A)RDS, FR(A)MED, all sim above farmed. interesting.
>Tara_and_Derek: EIKNSV I3 KNIVES +28 52
>Jackson_and_Alex: GHIOOSS D10 OHO +27 51
#note I like what HOG does to the board, but I think I may prefer OHO, not sure. I saw GOO(D)ISH but thought it was invalid. darn.
>Tara_and_Derek: ACP C12 CAP +20 72
#note n1 sis.
>Jackson_and_Alex: GGISSTW 15A WIST +32 83
>Tara_and_Derek: EJ F6 JE. +31 103
>Jackson_and_Alex: CEGGINS 5I .GG +10 93
#note Considered C(I)G for a while, and I liked the volatility because there is only 1 unseen S, and I liked EGINS. I also liked 4 more points, and CEINS wasn't bad at all. Yegh.
>Tara_and_Derek: AINNO 4K ANION +15 118
>Jackson_and_Alex: ACEEINS O3 E.CINA +24 117
#note A(P)IECE 14B. Nice one squush. We considered (FE)E, but didn't think there were enough lanes after the N in ANION inevitably got blocked. (COD)E accomplishes the creation of new lanes, but, 7 points is justnot enough. I don't see any huge problem with ENCINA. 
>Tara_and_Derek: ADEIMOR N8 AIRDOME +76 194
>Tara_and_Derek: ADEIMOR --  -76 118
#note They looked at my reaction after putting down airdome, and apparently I didn't give of any telling features taht I was about to instantly challenge!
>Jackson_and_Alex: EEIILRS G8 .IE +4 121
#note Wow I'm just sucking this game. REI, SPIELER, SPILE, SPIEL, PILEI, LEI, LIKE, PILE, REI, PIE, THEN LIE. I liked LIE, and still like it, but I agree other plays are better.
>Tara_and_Derek: ADEIMOR H10 ROAMED +32 150
#note There is no need to block radiomen, as they don't know it. I also didn't think they'd see RADOME, but roamed is still 32, blech. Their intention with this play was to block the lane I created (accomplished by creating 4-5 new lanes!). 
>Jackson_and_Alex: EEILRSU N8 LEISURE +70 191
>Tara_and_Derek: EGPR M2 GR.PE +16 166
#note PEG 11F
>Jackson_and_Alex: IORSUUY M9 YOU +23 214
>Tara_and_Derek: I 4H I. +3 169
#note I hear Tara whisper to Derek: If that E (points to E in LEISURE) weren't there, we'd have REIGNITE. I then assume they have EGIINRT, with blanks maybe. I don't see why they would play IN, as it accomplishes nothing. They are just not going to bingo on this board.
>Jackson_and_Alex: IORSTUW 15L WIST +41 255
#note I like this play, as it blocks the 14 row, and hard to hit bingos along the L column. I tell Alex we don't need to worry about bingos unless they find a disconnected 9. 
>Tara_and_Derek: ??AEINR 13F RE.AINde. +72 241
#note ...Don't speak so soon Jackson. And JACKSON YOU MISSED THE WIST -> TWIST HOOK YOU SUCKKK. (btw this is jackson talking). 
>Jackson_and_Alex: AALNORU K9 LAUA. +10 265
#note I don't like LAUAN because inb4 AY, but I also like it because it cleans up the rack, scores a little bit, and blocks a Q spot that they are inevitably going to hit. AL(P) was better.
>Tara_and_Derek: FZ J12 F.Z +40 281
#note Nice find.
>Jackson_and_Alex: HLNOORX 10J H. +13 278
>Tara_and_Derek: DOT 7K TOD +18 299
>Jackson_and_Alex: DLNOORX 4G L.. +3 281
#note In retrospect LO and JO was better than LIN. I saw ORDO which sims best, but didn't like it because it defeats the purpose of blocking QAT. 
>Tara_and_Derek: BBEY 3I .EY +17 316
#note Tara wasn't certain her tracking was perfect, so they blocked QI. From my last play they could have deduced I didn't have the Q though, and it was unlikely I would have drawn it after a one tile play. She should pass here (she doesn't have the Q here). She was talking about passing with her partner, but (thankfully) turned it down. My legs were shaking vigourously from nervousness when tara hovered her hand above the clock, about to pass. Passing is right because she ensures she wins. Her other three tiles here
>Jackson_and_Alex: ADNOORX 10B DO.. +11 292
>Tara_and_Derek: BBEQTT L6 B.B +14 330
#note They wanted me to play AX(E) so they could play Q(A)T through it. Nope, not doing that.
>Jackson_and_Alex: ANORX 6F .O +9 301
>Tara_and_Derek: EQTT 14C .ET +7 337
#note Again hoping I would play AXE, again, nope.
>Jackson_and_Alex: ANRX J2 N. +4 305
>Tara_and_Derek: QT 15K T.... +8 345
#note They had to score 11 poitns to win.
>Jackson_and_Alex: ARX 1J AX +12 317
>Tara_and_Derek: Q -  +0 345
>Jackson_and_Alex: R 1I R.. +10 327
>Jackson_and_Alex:  (Q) +20 347
