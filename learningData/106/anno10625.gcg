#note It seems risky, but there aren't many tiles that can hurt me too badly, and I've got a free shot to draw to DDDDNNNRRRTTT with ACEI.

#note Can you find my best play?
>dacrON: ACDEINT N7 C..INATED +78 366
#note N(E)CTA(R)IED is the game winner, likely, based on how things played out.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: ?DENNTU D8 iNUND.TE +68 399
>dacrON: DGOORTZ F10 ZOR. +33 399
#note No win here for me. I figured this play gave him the best chance of messing up. As if Kenji would mess up an endgame with 10 minutes on his clock.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CEGL 13K G.L. +10 409
#note This is the best play, two other plays win by one, and a bunch tie.
>dacrON: DGOT O14 DO +21 420
#note C(R)E(D)O also gets the win. This made the series 1-1.
>Kenji_Matsumoto: CE 11J EC. +10 419
