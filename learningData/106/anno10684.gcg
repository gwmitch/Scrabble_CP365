#note I have no good explanation for this horrible play. I had just played an annoying game and I think I just lazily assumed that playing through the E couldn't score as much as something parallel at D12. I actually remember thinking that this set up DRY for the next turn if I stayed consonant-heavy, which wouldn't be an issue if I bothered to look for and count any D-column plays. The failure to at least see HYPED or HYPER (coincidentally, the two best plays) is just baffling. I wish I knew what causes really awful plays like this, because I always feel like I'm concentrating every turn.
>Chris: ENOSW J7 ENOWS +30 56
>Bill: DIRSTYZ I3 DITZY +33 83
>Chris: EIIPRV 3C PRIVIE. +28 84
#note Phony. I decided that it seemed reasonable enough to verbify PRIVY to mean letting someone in on a secret. It also probably subconsciously looked valid because of PRIVIES and PRIVIER.
>Bill: ?ENORSW 8A SWoONER. +83 166
#note UNSWORE fits nicely at K4 for three more. No double-doubles.
>Chris: ADELNU 5E LUNA.ED +32 116
>Bill: ?DDFORV A4 FORD. +13 179
#note Chris seemed unsatisfied playing LUNATED. I think he realized that the board dynamics were rapidly turning against him.
>Chris: CU H1 CU. +15 131
>Bill: ?DIMOTV 6D VIM +26 205
#note Give me a break, Quackle, there's no way you can tell me with a straight face that this play at 13A for two more has a higher win%.
>Chris: O 10J .O +5 136
>Bill: ?CDIOQT 9J .TIC +11 216
#note I knew this was probably somewhat weak, but I figured it was a decent way to keep the board under control, taking sevens back out of the equation, keeping C the only letter to play through without specificity, and I the only other one even with specificity. I had some slight doubt on ODIC. I also was hoping for the last H or S for B10 QOPHS. L8 QuOIT for 52 is certainly correct, forking the lane into two very restrictive lanes and of course scoring a ton more. I didn't notice it.
>Chris: A B12 .A +4 140
#note Poor Chris. Man, does it ever suck being reduced to this.
>Bill: ?ABDGOQ A13 BOG +22 238
#note I was fully expecting to rid myself of the Q this turn, but the fish required a response. Too bad, because there are some fun sevens to be had in ABDGO??. I looked at the first letter that I drew, and if I had dumped the Q I would've had DOGBANE playable the next turn.
>Chris: AEGIKNR 1H .REAKING +110 250
#note Yikes. I don't feel sorry for him anymore.
>Bill: ?ADELQU 14A .DALiQUE +136 374
>Bill: ?ADELQU --  -136 238
#note I had a strong feeling that this was Collins-only (I don't study it yet, but I got the new CSW and like to idly page through it), and this is a particularly bad point in the game to be exposing my full rack and sitting on the Q for another turn. However, I wasn't SURE it was Collins-only, and I'd have to slap myself if I passed on a 136-point bingo.
>Chris: AA 10E AA +17 267
>Bill: ?ADELQU M9 .ALQUE +34 272
#note I had to swallow hard to make this play, knowing that he probably had a good leave. It was quite a relief to pick up the case S on the draw. Quackle knows no fear, giving my aggressive tack the gold star in the sim.

>Bill: ?ADHRST 15G DeARTHS +110 382
>Chris: A 11M .A +2 328
>Bill: EIJOOOR O9 OORIE +9 391
#note Best -- one point better than either taking JO immediately or the highest-scoring spot for OORIE.
>Chris: ABEGILM D1 BA.M +22 350
#note Meh.
