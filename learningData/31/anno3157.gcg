#note Damn, I played poorly Monday morning. I was really pissed off during the first few moves here, after Gibson hampered my chances of winning. My dual openings strategy was stupid, should have traded 6 or played something like GUIRO.

#note Great find. I held.
>Sam_Rosin: ADEMORV A8 OVER.AD +33 144
#note I agonized over this play, but didn't see/know an easy option--VAMOSED in the same spot. The poor positioning of the V is overcome by the six points.
>Marlon_Hill: FLN 2F FL.N +15 254
#note Curious to know Marlon's rack here, he may have said but I forget it.
>Sam_Rosin: DDEEEMN 13G EMENDED +83 227
>Marlon_Hill: AILNOOP D4 POOLIN. +22 276
#note Correct rack. Looks like a good play to me in terms of rushing towards the end of the game. Quackle isn't thinking about that, and has a few plays like APO 12K and MOO H13 ahead of it. APO looks worth considering at least.
>Sam_Rosin: EHHMQRS 12L HERM +37 264
>Marlon_Hill: AIILO O12 .OIL +18 294
#note Marlon had this and two more vowels I can't remember, something like AO. 
>Sam_Rosin: ?AHQRST 14N Q. +22 286
>Marlon_Hill: IOO 7C O.IO +5 299
#note Marlon had at least a few more vowels here.
>Sam_Rosin: ?AHRSTT 10I .HAT +32 318
>Marlon_Hill: AAEEISZ 6L .IZ +35 334
#note The actual rack. I'm pretty sure Marlon was unhappy with his draw.
>Sam_Rosin: ?IIRSTV 14C ReVISIT +74 392
#note The sim might slightly prefer something like VIS 3B, but I was confident Marlon wouldn't have anything big on row 15. I knew he had an A (he put down AZO E5 before playing WIZ) and UU (he put them face up on the table after drawing them). 
>Marlon_Hill: AAEESUU 15H SAU +27 361
>Sam_Rosin: AEGKNST 6B KN.T +22 414
#note I put down the S then took it back, which was really dumb. SNAG 7L is best, followed by TOKE C6 for the out.
>Marlon_Hill: AEELU B10 LE. +14 375
#note LEAN 3A, LEU C2, and EAU C2 are all best.
