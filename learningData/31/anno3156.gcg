#note Couldn't convince myself VANADIC was good, thought it was a figment of my imagination given VANAD*. It's from VANADIUM of course. Would have played that, but feared a challenge.
>Marlon_Hill: ?DEHILO 13G HILlOED +89 147
#note This would have been a nongo had I played VANADIC.
>Sam_Rosin: ADMNORV L10 MOV.D +22 118
#note After 1,500 iterations, other plays simming closely are DEV L12, NOVA 12L, DORM 12L, MOVE L10, VODUN 10B. I like my play though.

>Sam_Rosin: ACDEIIN C10 DI.A +16 202
#note This play sims poorly, about 6-7 equity points back of the leaders. I sort of liked it at the time. Plays simming well include ICED 4A, CADI and CEDI 4B, AIDED 14J, ADVICE C10, CANID 4B. With all four esses out, this board is probably more open than it seems. Would probably play CEDI 4B with a redo.
>Marlon_Hill: ADEHOPS 2C ODAH +39 289
#note Marlon's correct rack.
>Sam_Rosin: CEEILNU B4 LEUCINE +68 270
>Marlon_Hill: EPSSU A8 SUP +29 318
#note Part of Marlon's rack--I forget the rest.
>Sam_Rosin: EFMOTTY A1 MOTEY +41 311
>Marlon_Hill: EENS 4D NEE +23 341
#note Again, I forget the rest of Marlon's rack.
>Sam_Rosin: FITTTTU 14F FIT +22 333
#note Laid down TITI first, then remembered SUP. This looks susceptible to S-ending bingos at 15A, but if he has one of them I'm screwed anyway (column M). However this play does give him some good comebacks like SWIG for 30-something, or even worst-case scenarios like BASSY. TITI sims better with the inference--is it safer despite the seemingly lucrative S-hook? Most plays there are probably only 20-30 points I guess. This was a tough play to make no matter what I did.
>Marlon_Hill: AAIRS 15C RAIA +10 351
>Sam_Rosin: EGOTTTU 5G T.T +15 348
#note Still within striking distance; I like this play.
>Marlon_Hill: EIQRRSY M6 YIRRS +18 369
#note Marlon's actual rack. I didn't like this play, then and now. He was inferring that I was fishing from FIT and TIT, but this sets up another lane at N1/L1. Some of Q's favorite options in the sim are QIS M8, QI/QIS J4, and QIS J1. I sort of like QIS M8, blocking the most fruitful bingo lane for decent points.
>Sam_Rosin: BEGLOTU 8L G.UB +27 375
#note This is best, tied with a few other plays in the same spot at 87.5%. I first laid down OUTBEG, which would have lost to QI 7L. With one in the bag, no harm in laying something down to see it on the board, unless you suspect your opponent mistracked.

#note Um, OWLET 2I!!! This sacks a theoretical 25 equity points, 24 in actuality
>Marlon_Hill: EGNOQSS 15H SONG +24 393
