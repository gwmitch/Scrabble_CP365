>Jason: DINRRTU 8G DURR +10 10
#note I considered URD ... not sure why I passed on it. I also considered phonying and hoping Chuck gave me the E for INTRUD(E)R, but that didn't seem optimal. This sims about a point behind either URD placement.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADEGZ K7 GAZED +38 38
#note I drew the A on the pick to go first. "Geez, playing no. 1 AND I'm going second?" he said, laughing. "You can concede now if you'd like," I said. "Director, can't you do something about him?" he said. (Carol Rav then hit me over the head.)
>Jason: EEGINST 11D INGESTE. +70 80
#note Glad Q prefers this ... the choice between this or SIGNETED becomes key later.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ASX L8 SAX +39 77
>Jason: AEKLNPY J10 K.Y +44 124
#note Wasn't sure enough of KELPY, but I much prefer a PLANE leave to an ANE leave. Especially since after this, we've played 14 consonants and seven vowels (Paul Epstein would say 13 Cs and 8 Vs...) and the pool's about to become even more vowel-heavy. This is only simming about a point behind KELPY.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ??AITTW D6 WAITl.sT +70 147
#note Q wants Chuck to pass on the bingo with WATT or WAIT at 12A. They're simming about six-seven points ahead of this, the best bingo.
>Jason: ABELNPU C5 BAP +22 146
#note Last time I remember having this rack, I made a big mistake, missing PRUNABLE vs. Bowman in the Hudson final. This time I had this rack, I made a big mistake, missed UP(GAZED). (U)NU(S)ABLE would've been quite sweet too, and prevented the impending disaster. A 25-point mistake.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ANNOQTU H11 .QUAT +72 219
#note "That's the amount of respect you're showing me!" I said. "You'd have gotten even less if you gave me the O for NONQUOTA or the G for QUANTONG!" he retorted.
>Jason: BELLNUY E3 BULLY +34 180
#note "Here's a fitting play," I said. "For which one of us?" Chuck said. "Both of us, I think," I said. I can't say I agree with Q's pick of LUNY in the same spot. That sims about 1-2 points ahead.
>Chuck_Armstrong: NO 3C NO. +10 229
>Jason: CEHINST G1 SNITCHE. +66 246
#note Big mistake no. 2: Chuck took so long to play NOB, I had plenty of time to look for the playable bingos. I whiffed on NITCHES' anagram (STHENIC, B7). When I see ACEHINST in study, I always see CHANTIES and miss ASTHENIC. Here I couldn't see either! This sims 17 behind ASTHENIC, but considering what Chuck's rack is, it's a more costly mistake than that.
>Chuck_Armstrong: CEELNOR 1B ENCLO.ER +89 318
#note Obviously from Chuck's fish, I'm worried about trip-trips ... he puts down one tile at a time, he's got CLOSE down and I said "uh-oh." Then he put the N down and I'm thinking "NONCLOSE*???" Then he put the E down and I relaxed a little. He put the R at A1 to make RENCLOSE* and I couldn't keep my poker face, making a "WTF?" look. He laughed. "I thought I'd test you," he said. Rob Long and David Ross even looked over to see what was going on. (Oh yeah, and if I play ASTHENIC, COER(C)E is prolly Chuck's best play. Hmph.)
>Jason: AHIIMOO 2B HAO +30 276
#note This or (C)HIAO, which I thought of just after hitting my clock.
>Chuck_Armstrong: JU 13B JU. +20 338
>Jason: DFIIMOO 14B OM +30 306
#note Glad this finishes a hair ahead of DOM ... I agonized between the two, but wanted to play fast. Chuck took a long time to play JUT and had less than four minutes at this point.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EOPR 15A REPO +38 376
#note Gah! DOM prevents this! Just one of those games ... my two big mistakes each got whacked and here I zagged when I should've zigged.
>Jason: ADEFIIO 5G .OIFED +24 330
#note FO(l)IA is clearly superior ... about six points, Q says. Banking on a lucky draw to get me back in the game.
>Chuck_Armstrong: DEIT 4I TIDE +26 402
#note Chuck, if you don't want those tiles, I'll take them... :)
>Jason: AAIILRW B5 AW +35 365
#note Surprised RAW is slightly preferred by Q.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EF 6I EF +33 435
#note Chuck insta-played all three plays after JUT. Carol Rav was done and, seeing the speed Chuck played this and his clock, said: "Who needs time?" I retorted: "Not when you've got mindless decisions!" :)
>Jason: AEIILMR 3L MI +14 379
#note Another 25+ point pre-endgame equity hit. MI(l)IA is CP's clear pick and the valuation leader by far, but then he blocks the last bingo lines ... how am I winning after that? I'm banking on the reasonably probable NV draw for RAVELIN or IN(T)ERVAL or something of that ilk.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EGV N1 VEG +20 455
>Jason: AEIIILR 1K ALI.E +27 406
#note Another big pre-endgame hit as RIVE sims 10 better than LIVE, almost 20 better than this.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ANNOOSV A3 VAN +12 467
#note SOON at 13J first is better, setting up N(O)VA. Only a two-point error, though.
>Jason: IIRR F9 RI. +6 412
#note Best, correctly deducing that I can't play R(IFF) because I need to leave an out. (Plus, everybody else was done and Carol Rav might have killed us for prolonging the endgame.)
>Chuck_Armstrong: NOOS 13J SOON +19 486
#note Steve Anstandig asked who won. "He did," I said. I pointed at the spot for ASTHENIC. "One big mistake," I said. "Can't make mistakes against Chuck." Said Steve: "And sometimes you can not make a mistake against Chuck and it still isn't enough." Indeed. I doubt many people are saying that about me, too. Forget the rating system, Chuck proves again who the true king of Michigan Scrabble is.
>Chuck_Armstrong:  (IR) +4 490
