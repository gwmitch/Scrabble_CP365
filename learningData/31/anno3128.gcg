#note Quackle prefers a variety of exchanges, most f al keeping DEZ or BEZ. BEG might also be a bit better than this.

>Noah: ACDITTZ L10 Z.DIAC +42 75
#note A close decision between DITZ 10D, AZOTIC L9, and this. An extensive sim gives this a small edge.
>Demigod: EEEOPRT 10L .EE +20 88
>Noah: AIIISTT O6 TITIS +28 103
#note This time it's another close choice-between TIPI, TITIS, and ATTIC. Didn' consider TIPI-however, Quackle sems to merit it a bit better than this. Fortunately, only a minute mistake.

#note Bad play, CHAM 15L is better.

>Noah: AAIOORY C9 A.IARY +20 181
#note Knowing the word ARROYO here would have been really helpful. Looks like all placements of that are better. Quackle also prefers OFAY A9 to this by a little bit. Huh.

#note This game gets more and more annoying every turn. I decided to play desperation, but this might not be so smart. Quackle doesn't like this, and it seems quite right. I should have thought of a more creative play like AGO in the same spot. It's still desperate, but a little better played. Quackle is near certain to take this spot, while setting up the DAGO hook will probably yield more fruitful results. Overall though, this situation is looking pretty hopeless.

>Noah: ?BDEEOU B13 OBE +28 224
#note Didn't know BEROUGED, and I don't think I knew OUtBREED either. Quackle's favorite bingo is BErOUGED 2D (?) and its favorite play is BODE J1. BODE seems right. But why did Quackle have to play XI!
>Demigod: ACNNORS 2C CRANNO.S +65 411
>Noah: ?DEELOU D1 U.ODELEs +68 292
#note Missing LOUvERED. This sims better, although I don't trust it, and somehow this wins one-fifth of a percent of the time. CRANNOGS was definitely game over
>Demigod: AKLNSTW 1G AW. +35 446
>Noah: FHILQTV 14F QI +35 327
#note I saw HEFT, which is actualy 4 points better. It hardly matters now.
