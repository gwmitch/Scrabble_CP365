#note putting it away?
>dacrON: AEGNPSV A12 PANG +44 391
#note Only way to win the game - what else am I going to do. Figured it was phony, but had to try. That said, Q disagrees that PANG is better than PAVE. I think it's a great idea to keep the E for next turn.
>Jan_Dixon: ADJRTUZ N6 ZA +34 426
#note She held for about a minute, and then let it go, because she thought ZA would win. Can you find my winning play? Once you find it, can you find the inhumanly insane winning sequence?
>dacrON: AEFISV 5D FIVES +44 435
#note FIVES is three points less than FAVES - I missed (EX)I(t). FAVES is tied with FAVE M7, (BREW)IS 4D(!). (-3). There are a couple other wins, but unless you know BREWIS, you gotta see HOWF...

>dacrON:  (DR) +6 448
#note This might be my best played game ever... (-4). The sequence after her 2nd bingo is just ridiculous.
