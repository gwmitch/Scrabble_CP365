#note Darn! Opening long is wrong here, with TOY as best.

>Noah: INNOSVW J10 WON +29 53
#note Quackle prefers INWOVE or VOW 9G by a smidge-probably to conserve the SIXTEENS hook.

#note The great leave of AELS is enough to merit playing PIA M2, apparently. Quackle also prefers PAH and AA.

>Noah: AAAOSUZ -AAOU +0 214
#note Good-I need a huge bingo and other plays to pull this game in my favor. Of ourse, this still barely wins at all. Quackle likes keeping OSZ and AZO all about equally with this.

>Noah: BIILLRS G5 LIB +26 290
#note Wow. Didn't think of the fantastic LI G5, which wins about 1% more games than this-it fishes for BRULZIES. An excellent play I wish I had thought of.

>Noah: BFILORS C7 FLORI.S +30 320
#note Whiffed on BRISTOL/STROBIL, which would play if I drew a blank to, say, 14A EF. This isn't to bad though-guarantees an out in one unless opponent bingos with something like MOUSAkA.
>Demigod: ?AMOSUU 8A MO. +15 467
>Noah: ABM B14 MA +18 338
#note Doh! I was thinking about having 1 tile to draw, not two when I said that it guaranteed an out in two. Oh well. Quackle's play is quite elegant, a wonderful out in two. Blocking the high scoring one isn't even in my interests because MOLA gives me inability to go out and sticks me with BM.
