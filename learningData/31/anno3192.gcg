>Noah: DELSSWZ 9G ZED +34 82
#note Quackle likes I7 ZED. I guess it is worth the sacrifice of points to keep a consonant and set up the S.

#note Quackle likes QIS. To set up JUS?
>Dave_Wiegand: ?AEGGIU 3B GArIGUE +74 193
>Noah: EIJNRSV M5 JIN +17 164
#note This is second best, but the fantastic VI(EWE)R is far better.

#note Apparently, this is a bad play. I didn't realize that. WHOA 10D, which I saw, is best.
>Dave_Wiegand: EKNT 8A KENT. +30 372
>Noah: ABDNOSU 9K .OB +20 310
#note So I missed ABOUNDS!!!! I saw it a couple minutes later. I also didn't know BAUSOND, which would have done very well in this situation. Quackle also lies BOUND, ADOBE better than this. BAUSOND would have won 25% of the time, ABOUNDS about 10% of the time. (considering he has HEROINE, more if we don't consider that) Ugh.

#note AUDIT 11H.

>Noah: AAILSTT O2 STAT +27 354
#note Didn't know ALIST, which is four points better. Should've played WAIT before playing SLAT as opposed to this play.
