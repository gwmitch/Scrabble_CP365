#note Joey: I couldn't find anything great here.  I was hoping for a big play at A11 next turn.

#note Very nice job by Joey here, quickly slapping down the optimal two blank bingo.
>Dave: EIIMPRX E10 XI +31 170
#note Shame I didn't have an O to play through.

>Dave: AAEIMPR 13J AMIA +42 212
#note I spent a while on this rack, as I suspected I might have a bingo.  I thought of playing off the N, and I even thought to myself, "hmm, does PERMIAN plus an A make anything?"  But I completely failed to remember PEARMAIN.  Perfect example of a word that's so deep in my cardbox system (currently in box 10, haven't seen in 330 days) that I haven't practiced it enough.  I may have to take Will Anderson's advice about lowering the maximum number of days it can sit idle.

#note And of course after my miss, he immediately beats me to the place where my bingo would fit.  There are other ways of playing here, but given that there's no guarantee future bingos will fit, it seems to make sense to take the points this way.
>Joey: AEEEEGT C10 AGEE +22 235
>Dave: CEKNOPS L1 POCKS +42 290
#note Missing another bingo through the T.  I can forgive myself for this one, as it's a harder find and I still have a good chance to win after this play.
>Joey: BEEJLTY 4A JEBEL +46 281
>Dave: AENORUY 11J AY +29 319
#note I would have been happy to keep playing more tiles here, but I just didn't have any long plays that were nearly as good as this.
>Joey: IILOTVY 3H V.LO.ITY +32 313
#note That's why he's Joey Mallick.  Played very quickly, of course.
>Dave: AENORRU O3 .ARNER +30 349
#note Who knows what to do here?  Being greedy and turning over tiles seemed for the best, and I was already running low on time.  I considered fishing for RIOJA, but I couldn't justify slowing down too much on this turn.
>Joey: EIIMNOS A1 MIS.OIN +48 361
#note Dang it, Joey's pulled into the lead.  I'm sucked into burning more time holding his play and trying to remember its validity.  I've got a drekky rack.  I've messed up my tracking.  And I'm running out of time.  I do manage to keep my cool and not go overtime the rest of the way, but I squander opportunities that I wouldn't have if I had managed my time better.  I gotta give Joey credit though; his fast play helped put the pressure on me.
>Dave: DIIOORU C1 ORI.I +14 363
#note Goes a long way to cleaning the rack out, but not the best timing.  Probably better to just play OBI.  At the time, I mistakenly thought there was an extra L out and that I was going to get hammered by FLEW D12, but I could not find any decent play that took the spot away.  I was lucky to draw the L myself, or I would have.
>Joey: BEFGNRW 14F FR.G +15 376
#note I've caught up on my tracking by this point, but don't have much time to think.
>Dave: DELOUV 15C VOLE +13 376
#note Ah, UPDOVE, I can win!  Oh damn, it doesn't fit!  Omg, seconds left, what to do???  I thought of DEV H1, but didn't see how I would go out with my other letters.  I saw OVULE 1D, but totally missed playing it at 7K, which is the last remaining way to clinch the win here.  I am sure that I would have found it with more time.  So many opportunities to win this one, frittered away.
>Joey: BENW D1 WE +20 396
#note Joey: WEB N7 gives me one more point to spare.
>Dave: DU K1 UD. +11 387
