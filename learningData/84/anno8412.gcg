>Evans_Clinchy: AEEJLPS 8D JAPES +44 44
#note Quackle prefers JEEPS since it doesn't slot a vowel next to the DLS. Meh. I guess.
>Marty_Gabriel: EEFILNR E6 FL.NERIE +72 72
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEHLOS F8 .OH +31 75
#note Unfortunately ARSEHOLE takes the pound sign. OPAH is ours though. Coulda played that.
>Marty_Gabriel: ADEGIRS G1 DISAGRE. +62 134
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEHLST 3A HEATLE.S +72 147
#note Anamonic for HEATLES -- CRAPPIEST SPORTS SUPERSTARS.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEW 2B WAE +26 160
>Evans_Clinchy: ADGNTTY 12D D.NGY +28 175
#note DITTY in the same spot is another option, but I wanted to keep the T's for the TWAE hook. Quackle vehemently disagrees, since the AGN leave is a lot stronger than ATT. Oh well.
>Marty_Gabriel: KNU 1G .UNK +27 187
>Evans_Clinchy: ADNOTTV 5G .AVOT +18 193
#note Not great defensively. Sim suggests NTH A1, which scores more and doesn't open anything up. Interesting idea.
>Marty_Gabriel: BEW 1A WEB +35 222
>Evans_Clinchy: DEINORT K3 IN.ORTED +59 252
>Marty_Gabriel: APU H12 .AUP +27 249
>Evans_Clinchy: EIOSTTV A3 .OTTIE +30 282
#note I've got a slight tempo advantage here, right? So why get adventurous? Rather than open a second TWS spot with VETO L1, I thought I'd close the existing TWS with HOTTIE. Quackle disagrees. (This is a theme here.)
>Marty_Gabriel: ?EGLMNU B8 LEGUMiN +78 327
#note Worth noting that LEGUMIN still plays elsewhere if I don't give him this lane (line L). So HOTTIE wasn't the worst play in the world, I guess.
>Evans_Clinchy: NORSTVX 9J V.X +13 295
#note Gotta ditch the S and set up a bingo lane. This works.
>Marty_Gabriel: ?ABLORY 15H .ROBAbLY +95 422
#note Oh snap.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEMZ J13 AZ. +32 449
#note Best. Slow-playing out is better than playing AMAZES now.
>Marty_Gabriel: IIRU 10K .U.R +16 488
>Evans_Clinchy: EM H3 .E. +7 456
#note Low on time, I failed to do the math. It's actually better to go out right away with EM 14N than to dink him one tile at a time. Besides, I missed the best E spot -- FER 6E is one point more. Doesn't matter, I still lose.
