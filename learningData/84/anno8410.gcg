#note Best.  8D VOILE also worth consideration.

#note I always get confused between CUBER, which is good, and CONER*, which is not.  Q does not like this at all, preferring H1 CUBER and 10D CUBE, which I didn't know the back hook to make.  While CUBER is the better play, this had one unexpected benefit:  if I had made that play I would not have caught the break that probably decided the game.

#note You have to know the bingo to play it.  I didn't know GERARDIA, which would have played at 5D for 90.  I figured that I'd play this and we'd trade bingos after he put down TALIPEDS.
>Jesse_Matthews: DEILPST H1 PILED +30 51
#note Except that, after several minutes he gives up, unable to find TALIPEDS.   Lucky for me he was exhausted from having to drive 2 hours to catch a 6 AM flight from Seattle.  Call it a hunch, but if I play him earlier in the day I would bet he doesn't miss the row 5 bingo.

#note Best.
>Jesse_Matthews: HWZ F10 WH.Z +27 78
>Jim_Burlant: GINPRTT 5E TR..ING +36 182
#note Best - nothing else worth consideration.  My favorite play this game, and it wins 88%.
>Jesse_Matthews: KO 10B KO. +26 104
>Jim_Burlant: AAACPTV 11A VAT. +24 206
#note Didn't know the best choice, 11I PATACA.  This is the runner up and it sims within 2-1/2 points.  I was concerned about slotting the triple and was a little leary about the potential S hook at 13C, but not knowing PATACA limited my choices.   After the game, Jesse told me that no matter what I put down, he had a big comeback.
>Jesse_Matthews: ??QS 13A QiS +46 150
#note Jesse told me post mortem that he had 5 consonants and both blanks in his rack.  I inferred the second blank, and sims will be run against an inferred blank.
>Jim_Burlant: AACILPT A13 .AT +36 242
#note No-go number 1.  Too many points to pass up, nothing else worth consideration.
>Jesse_Matthews: DIMSY K10 MYSID +35 185
>Jim_Burlant: ACEILPU H12 .ULP +21 263
#note That hurts a lot - no-go #2, as he just blocked my intended bingo of PECULIA.  I was beginning to get concerned, as I had (correctly) assumed since his Q play that he was sitting on the other blank.  I don't agree with Quackle here.  Against an inferred blank, the sim says I should just fish off the U with 10K MU.  This sims mid-pack.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?EIIMOT 1H .IMIEnTO +86 271
#note Best bingo.
>Jim_Burlant: AACEILS J12 .AIL +13 276
#note Now it's my turn to whiff.  I saw ALCAIDES, which didn't play.  Unfortunately, I missed CANALISE.  This could have cost me the game.  I was getting very concerned, as I saw this slipping away from me and I had to remind myself to stay focused.  The best non-bingo options are 15K SAICE and 15K SCALE; I thought MYSID was an adjective and therefore would not have taken an S.
>Jesse_Matthews: EE 10F .EE +19 290
>Jim_Burlant: ACEENSS 3G C.EANSES +78 354
#note At least I found this one, and it wins 89%.
>Jesse_Matthews: EGORU 4A ROUGE +16 306
>Jim_Burlant: EIIOTTU A4 .OUTE +15 369
#note Couldn't think of UTERI, which is a hair better than this.  But this is a a solid option that sims very well.
>Jesse_Matthews: O 11K .O +5 311
>Jim_Burlant: DIOT M11 DO +10 379
#note I don't have this rack written down correctly, but with 3 in the bag I opted to force him to empty it.  I do recall debating whether I should have put down DOIT, but that's all I remember about this rack.

#note I was apparently unable to read my own handwriting.  Though the play of QiS was scored correctly as 46, I read the 150 as 156, and these extra six points propagated through to the rest of the game.  Final score recorded as 410 - 382.
