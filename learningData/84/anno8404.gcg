#note Yes, I thought of CUTEY, but I didn't think it was worth it to keep EJ. One consideration is that this is a scoring board, not  bingo board. That migt make CUTEY better, since EET is kind of boring on this board. Looking back, maybe CUTEY instead.

>whatnoloan: EENNTUV K4 VENU. +16 66
#note Some plays I considered here: VENUE, VEN(G)E, UNEV(E)N, VENU(E). I liked UNEV(E)N and VENU(E) because they gave Bharat less to work with, and UNEV(E)N might be better in hindsight, since it gives even less, I think.

#note Meh. Time pressure, so I didn't have solid thinking here. Luckily I'm not in much trouble here. Looking again, I kind of like (J)O(I)N, saving the case T and blocking sevens.

#note Quackle likes NOW D12, setting up NOWT. This just keeps too many tiles to go for an out in one.
