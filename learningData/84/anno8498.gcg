#note glottis ok
>Huguette_Settle: BJ H7 J.B +12 12
>Matthew_Larocque: DILNSTT 10D DINTS +21 29
#note Pretty yucky. I could exchange, but 20 points seemed like just enough to make the play. EXCH DLT actually sims at the top, along with LIST for 19.
>Huguette_Settle: DKN E9 K.ND +18 30
>Matthew_Larocque: HILNSTT 13A THINS +26 55
#note Geez. Grabbed another S, but forced to burn it again just to make a decent scoring play. Sim prefers to keep LNT by playing THIS or HIST instead. Or, the sim winner, (T)ILTH for 9 points. Sure I could bingo with NST if I actually draw vowels, but I'm not so far.
>Huguette_Settle: HO I6 HO. +18 48
>Matthew_Larocque: FIILLOT B10 LIT.O +20 75
#note I did not know FILLO with 2 ells. That looks like the right move at 2J. FLIT/HI/JOT takes second, this is tied for 3rd with LIT in the same spot as FLIT.
>Huguette_Settle: AOZ A8 ZOA +38 86
>Matthew_Larocque: ACFILRT J7 TALC +27 102
#note This sims badly, but I think Quackle really likes keeping C in the leave, and I don't. It suggests FLIT or FRIT in the same spot as before.
>Huguette_Settle: AGO K5 GOA +19 105
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIPRWY A13 .YE +23 125
#note EDIFY is a word I continue to miss. It plays for 36 here. Quackle also prefers getting rid of the P for some reason, but I dislike Y and W, so one of those had to go.
>Huguette_Settle: AEIU 12D A.IEU +18 123
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIPRRW 13H PI +9 134
#note Ok this was a very awful move, I can't remember why I did it. (T)W(E)RP looks like the only thing worth playing here based on the choices. I tend to make bad plays when the game is close in an effort to keep scoring, I guess.
>Huguette_Settle: MU J7 ....UM +10 133
>Matthew_Larocque: FIIRRRW -FIIRRRW +0 134
#note Sim says keep an R for an extra .5% chance to win.
>Huguette_Settle: AOV B6 OVA +19 152
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEQRU 11I Q.A +24 158
#note Lots of options here, I just kind of crumbled and didn't know what do do. QUA(HOG) is neat and is the sim winner. Next best options are (M)ARQUE and (JOTA)s/sQUARE for 59. The 69 point placement is understandably quite dangerous.
>Huguette_Settle: ?EEFLRS 14I FEELeRS +77 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEIRU O12 RU.E +15 173
#note Yikes bad play alert. DECURIES seemed vaguely familiar, but I wasn't sure enough, and didn't want to risk loosing a turn and leaving that S hanging around. Several other bingos available here, including a flashy REtICU(L)E.

 I had to play there, so I got rid of the U and left it open for potential bingos. Still, I can't keep missing golden chances like this.
>Huguette_Settle: EIP 9C PI.E +18 247
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEINX 12J .IX +26 199
#note I had no reason to miss XENIC here, and that sims better than the 84 point EXIgENC(e) to boot. Blah.
>Huguette_Settle: EIU 9J .IEU +5 252
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEEGN C3 GENE +12 211
#note Paying for my earlier missed chances with crappy options now. Sim says CEE 10N has the slight advantage. I would think I need LIEU for an s hook, though.
>Huguette_Settle: AA 2B AA +10 262
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BCDEEM 4C .MBED +20 231
#note This actually sims pretty high, I wasn't sure how to deal with this rack. It alternates between this and MED M8.
>Huguette_Settle: ELRSY 15E LYRES +30 292
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACENOT 3G OCTANEs +74 305
#note Talk about a lucky break. I didn't have time to go through every bingo I could find, I literally slapped this down as fast as I could, as time trouble was looming and I couldn't afford to lose points that way.
>Huguette_Settle: VW J2 V.W +17 309
>Matthew_Larocque: FNRR E4 .RR +10 315
#note Dumping the F is a priority, but I saw that I had multiple places to play FN next turn to go out. so I kind of  hoped she would make a blunder next turn :/
>Huguette_Settle: DIORW L1 DR.W +20 329
>Matthew_Larocque: FN L8 F.N +10 325
#note I'm not sure if she didn't count how many points WORD/WE/Os was, or if she just played fast in an effort to make my time run out...either way the game was hers, but I salvaged it into a tie.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IO) +4 329
