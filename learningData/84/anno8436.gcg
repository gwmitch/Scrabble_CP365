#note jesus i missed the best play ever here. janes may be better than my bingo. the best play is jiveass in about fifty spots. (-30)

#note oh gives up too much and doesn't score as much next turn. the only reason it's any good is because it scores a lot now. F10 OGHAM seems to be the right play, but maybe not, it's close. 14D HOG is also ok.

#note this is a bad fish. 14A UM is obvious; there is no reason to not play it. i wanted the board to be more open, but i already have two S spots. UM scores more and i bingo more often and it gives up less. bad, bad move. (-12)

#note crap and now i need to bingo cuz i screwed up the last couple moves. luckily this seems like the best fish here. MOUSES L8 was something else i considered to start over....

#note actually, by win% taking the bingo is a small mistake. DIAZO at O6 sims best. whoops. (-0.5%)

#note chris's last two tiles were LI (he laid them down, pretending to triple-triple). he was like a letter away from torpidly and then probably drawing the blank. sheesh! he also mentioned something about being unable to "draw his dick out of a tub of lard", making the tables around us laugh. i wonder how that would work...
>cesar: BCEIINY 4A Y.NIC +28 444
#note D2 VINIC may be a bit better, probably because i can score huge next turn with an A or O draw. (-6)
