#note A meltdown moment. I spent flipping forever trying to figure out what Joan was trying to do last turn. I couldn't determine which two letters she had transposed, and since I didn't see any bingos through the other letters, I thought it was safe to fish. 
>Joan: DENOORS C7 NOOD.ERS +72 108
#note OMG! How did I miss that?!?! I looked for possible bingos through the L and saw nothing, absolutely NOTHING! Jesus tap-dancing Christ, how blind do you have to be? And here I am forgoing COULEE and COLONEL thinking I'm safe. Ugh, stupidest move ever... So I spent a moment here to cool my jets, perchance to shore up this mess of a game.

#note Five days later, I was reiminiscing about this game, and how odd it was that I didn't see NOODLERS, having just studied all the 8s without an A before this tournament, and given a full glimpse of the order Joan intended to play her tiles. Suddenly it dawned on me that NOODLERS was not a word! I let out an ear-piercing scream in the middle of Uncle Ted's funeral and was consequently disinherited.
>Carl: NT B7 N.T +8 438
#note Ok, I didn't scream, and it was at Scrabble club, not Ted's funeral. But he still disinherited me, the cheap bastard.
>Carl:  (AIN) +6 444
#note Everything is true about this story, except Uncle Ted. No joke. Uncle Ted = bogus. This game = happened.
