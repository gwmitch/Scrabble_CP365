#note i held for a while but honestly, i don't know words, and he coulda probably played anything past about 11000 in probability and i'd let it go. btw that's my achilles heel. also i thought maybe sporotic was good :D. the way i will calculate equity loss for an accepted phony (i had a couple this tournament) is to compare the difference in equity for the opponent with these letters making a phony and passing. this will be harsh and i didn't do it this way for orlando natls (so i'll go back and fix those games there if i really want to compare how i did in the two tourneys). 20.5 equity here.

#note completely chickened out on KEVEL, i would have almost certainly challenged it as well. gah. 4K KEEVE is also nice. (-30) (20.5 for the accepted phony)
