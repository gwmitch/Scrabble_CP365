#note Nice job by Will challenging off a Collins only bingo.  COOKLESS and HOOKLESS are good in ours.

#note This play didn't feel very good and sim agrees, preferring D7 OBELIA

#note It was an interesting choice between FOU at N12 and N13, and FEU N13.  They all have advantages and disadvantages.  With the blank, I liked keeping the row 15 bingo lane partially open.  But with six O's played already, I'm thinking FEU might have been a better choice.

#note ILIUM was the play I was looking for here.
>Dave: ?ADENQW N3 WANE +30 272
#note Normally with the blank you want to dump the Q quickly, but I keep drawing good scoring plays that keep it.
>Will: AHILTUV 10C LATH +32 272
#note Saving the powerful IUV leave. I thought about VITA and not sure why I concluded that IUV +6 > HLU + a tougher board to open

#note I seriously flat-out missed 9I JO. Ridiculous.
>Dave: ?DEIINQ 5E QaID +38 367
#note With three other D's out and a tight board, this was definitely the right moment to burn the blank.  The only question is whether I should have played EQuID.  It does give him a little more to latch onto, but considering how vowel heavy the bag is, it might be a good idea.
>Will: ADENPTU 14E UNADEPT +70 352
>Dave: BEIIINV 6D NIB +31 398
#note I'm not sure if this was a smart or dumb thing to do.  He's made the score close, and points are at a premium.  However, if he gets the case S, I've just given him a very nice hook.  VIE in the same spot also plays an extra vowel,  but 9 points is a lot to give up here.
>Will: ADEOTUY 15E TOYED +48 400
>Dave: EEIIISV 9I V.E +22 420
#note Fortunately I had plenty of time on my clock to think about this endgame.  IVIES C2 is the natural play to unload this junk, but I really didn't like the endgame timing.  There's a good chance he can win with a good out in two.  There's no rush to use the S.  Meanwhile, I've got a good scoring spot for the V, which also takes away what is likely to be his best scoring play.  It's true that I could be laboring through the rest of this endgame with all this drek, but I probably have enough of a lead to absorb the damage.
>Will: ADEGIUV 7A UVEA +13 413
#note I am open to suggestions for what to do here. I think my best bet is to start up the I-stick strategy now, but I wasn't really attuned to it until the endgame was upon us.
>Dave: AEIIIRS A7 .RAEI +15 435
#note I saw that I was going to get stuck with an I, but by setting up a spot for one this way (as opposed to AUREI) I forced Will to use one of his tiles to block it instead of chasing after more points.  I don't understand Championship Player's valuation of VIA as two points better than this play.  If you follow its recommended line of play for both sides after both of them, you get the same final margin of 13 points.
