>Andrew_Fisher: KMOORST G3 MOOKT.RS +69 69
>Edward_Okulicz: DGIRSTW H1 GRID +33 55
#note Taking the points is best here, though GOWD 4F sims pretty well, and GODWIT(S) on rows 5 or 4 would be OK.
>Andrew_Fisher: AEIPRVY 10E VE.PIARY +70 139
>Edward_Okulicz: ?FHHSTW L8 WH. +16 71
#note Edward was getting irritated with my good fortune at this point, flinging the tile bag down after resorting to his two-tile dump. It looks as though WHO 5E would be slightly better, the R often being helpful subsequently.
>Andrew_Fisher: ABDILNN I3 BAND +24 163
#note PINDAN H10 scores best, and I weighed it up but preferred the leave with the floating G. 
>Edward_Okulicz: ?AFHSTU 8L .AFT +30 101
#note Edward wasn't sure enough to play GHASTFUL here (also overlooking FRAUGHTS/FLAUGHTS)
>Andrew_Fisher: EILNNQT -NQ +0 163
#note Simulation is pretty keen on PINNET and PINTLE H10, but in the end the exchange gets the nod.
>Edward_Okulicz: ?HOSTTU K10 .UTH +14 115
#note Not clear if this is the correct rack (Edward couldn't remember afterwards), but there are a couple of low-scoring bingos available.
>Andrew_Fisher: EEILMNT H10 .IMENT +39 202
>Edward_Okulicz: ??ORSTZ 13B eROTiZ.S +102 217
#note ZO 7M sims pretty well, retaining the two blanks while scoring handsomely. But this or RIOTIZES appears best.
>Andrew_Fisher: EEELOOU -EELOOU +0 202
#note Quackle is partial to OLEO 12C, leaving EEU. I don't like it. I kept one E back for possible use at 14C.
>Edward_Okulicz: AGINOSW 12A GNOW +33 250
#note Best score here seems to be RAWINGS 2H, but ANOW 14G wins the sim; Edward now has the lead, and takes a defensive tack.
>Andrew_Fisher: AEEGRTX 14B TEX +40 242
>Edward_Okulicz: AEEINSU 1F EU.ENIAS +60 310
>Andrew_Fisher: AEGIORR N8 .AIRGOER +78 320
>Edward_Okulicz: BEEILOU 15L BO.E +27 337
#note LIBERO 15J looks best here.
>Andrew_Fisher: CDFLOOP 2C COOF +30 350
#note I never thought of FON 14F - with the vowel-heavy bag, the CDLOP leave is not too shabby. FLOOD 2B was unappealing as it is easy to overlap.
>Edward_Okulicz: EILNUUY J5 UEY +15 352
#note Retaining IN is good policy with the G available, and this is also the last U with the Q unseen. Edward's play looks good, Quackle also suggesting YUKED and KUDU (which keeps the Y for scoring)
>Andrew_Fisher: ADELLNP D1 P.LLED +24 374
#note Chosen over (e.g.) POLLAN as the A guarantees a Q play (QAT in two spots, and perhaps even QADI 6B)
>Edward_Okulicz: ACEILNU A7 LACIN. +27 379
#note Edward told me he suspected this was a Q setup, but couldn't do a lot about it. Possible strategies here - assume you'll avoid the Q and aim for a bingo, the bag being quite friendly; score and try to outrun the opponent; or protect for a Q pickup by keeping the U. With the inference from my last play, erroneous though it may be, I would lean towards CLUEING A6, squandering the U but still keeping the A for QAT while scoring highly. Quackle also quite likes DUCK 6D leaving AEILN, possibly remunerative in two sectors. Edward's play falls a bit between two stools.

>Andrew_Fisher: AADEINV O6 AI. +3 377
#note I was extremely pleased with my play here, taking several minutes to find it. The main problems are QIS B6 for 36, and the outplay of EQUITES O4 which it is imperative to address. After ploughing through all sorts of possibilities, I hit on the setup for VANED which just squeaks home against QIS, meaning Edward has to try a different tack. Anyway, to my left Daniel Piechnick had been announcing his scores in silly voices to Edie Mueller, and proffering stupid puns or mispronunciations at every opportunity. It was getting very annoying, and after a few minutes trying to ignore him, I stopped the clock and told him to shut up. As it happened, Edward was desperate to go to the toilet, crying "Thank God you said that!" at the opportunity to relieve the tension and his bladder. Daniel was penitent.
>Edward_Okulicz: EEIQSU M1 .UQS +26 405
#note We were down to a minute or two each by now. QIS delivers a loss, and SUQ loses to DAVEN in column C so Edward is forced to burn the S.  However, at this point the bumbling tournament organiser Tim Reddan decided to stride to the front of the room and loudly announce the novelty prize for the previous round (a word related to shopping, or something equally dull). Edward exploded at him, leaping out of his chair with saliva flying and telling him to STFU. Took him a while to calm down after Tim wisely retreated.
>Andrew_Fisher: ADENV E5 DEV +23 400
#note Now I'm technically thwarted, with my outplay of DAVEN losing. So to plan B, playing out in two and seeing what happens in the dying seconds.
>Edward_Okulicz: EEI C2 .EE +16 421
#note ZEE G13 and CEE C2 provide the same score. In his stressed state, Edward overlooked my best outplay (somewhat hidden by the blank tile) and went for the wrong choice.
>Andrew_Fisher: AN 14F NA. +19 419
#note Whew! Extraordinary game, not just for the off-board activity.
>Andrew_Fisher:  (I) +2 421
