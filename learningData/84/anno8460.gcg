#note Not so good. I was trying to dump some of these vowels without opening anything too crazy, but I underestimated how crappy INOU was. UVEA 7D keeps AINO and looks considerably better. There are a few other things better than JAVA...
>Joel_Sherman: AEEVW 7I WEAVE +26 117
>Evans_Clinchy: BIINORU L7 .IBRIO +24 128
#note I thought this would be a solid play, setting up the N for next turn. Sim thinks BUNION D8 is better, though. Interesting. Keeping an R to hook WEAVE is a nice idea.

>Evans_Clinchy: CEEIMNU 13J MENU +24 152
#note Didn't know NEUMIC, which plays at D10. This is second-best.

#note Sim prefers ICHOR by a little bit. I just wanted to score more points and find those blanks, amigo.

#note Joel went four minutes over on his clock looking for a bingo. Turns out there is none. ANTIFUR and RUFFIAN/FUNFAIR are the only sevens in this rack.
