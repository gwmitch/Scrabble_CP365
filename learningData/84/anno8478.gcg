#note This was a frustrating case where the needs of the board and my rack didn't coincide.  I can't justify giving him all those hooks to row 15 with YOGI.  YOGA is a bit safer but has the same problem.  Also, with limited places to fit bingos, YOD 6F to keep the A instead of the O didn't seem worth the four point sacrifice.  I asked Joel about this turn afterwards.  He preferred my play to all of the alternatives.

#note With a couple of places to play the Q already and a likely A draw giving me QAT 10F, I liked taking the points this way instead of rushing to dump the Q.

#note Yeah, this guy's pretty good.

#note Didn't think of N1 ADIPIC here, which is a play I really like at this score.  It's the only thing I would do differently in this game, in retrospect.

#note I figured keeping the good synergy of the MB coMBo might give me better bingo chances than playing MAZE.  Slotting the G for potential -ING bingos wasn't bad either.

#note MAUND?  No thanks.  I'd rather keep the M than the B, and keeping the A is good too.
