#note Quackle likes ZOA 8G, which surprises me. Pretty weak defensively, no?

#note This will sound stupid, but I swear it's the truth: I saw ARCHAEA but missed AG. Yup, that happened.

#note This is kinda silly. At this score, why open the EVENT hook and force myself to worry about it for the rest of the game? Quackle suggests a very nice alternative -- just take out line O now with FEMS for 23. Didn't think of that. It kills the board pretty nicely -- if Edley bingos after FEMS, it's gonna be a crappy 62-pointer that offers me counterplay.

#note Normally, my style is to make an equity-robotty-type play like LOO or NOO here. But I figured with the lead, I'd take a worse leave in exchange for shutting down line N. I'm trying to get better at making plays like this.

#note This is a solid nine points back of the sim leaders, but I kinda like it. It totally kills his chances of bingoing in this corner, which something like COSIE O1 (Quackle's pick) doesn't.

#note Quackle says VOILE, leaving me with six tiles next turn. Hmm, not sure. I think I had to pee and wanted to end the game faster.
>Joe_Edley: EIIOSTY 2B SO.TY +47 350
#note TEIIDS J10, followed by YO 2F, is nine points better.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEHR 11K REH.. +20 461
#note The best sequence is RE 13I followed by EH/BAH up in the top-right corner. I don't think I looked in that corner at all. Oh well.
>Joe_Edley: EII 6F .I +11 361
#note Joe's best play is his first name. He's supposed to use his E to block my E.
