#note SAU O13 is a good play, but considering how good this board is for S's at the moment, I like this aggressive approach too.
>Adam: EEINSW O8 NEWIES +42 107
>Dave: AENOSST F5 SO.TANES +62 130
#note I'm glad I had a bingo, but it's sorta bad luck that I had nothing better than this.

#note KANE 11C?  No thanks.
>Adam: AOV M3 OVA +35 228
>Dave: AFINQRU 8A QUAIN. +48 277
#note I briefly considered whether I could play AFQUORIN B8 and manage to hold my finger over the corner of the F while I drew tiles with the other hand.

>Adam: A 4L A... +20 276
>Dave: CDGLPPR C7 P.LP +12 325
#note It's more important to block as many bingo lines as possible than to chase after a few more points with PULP here.
>Adam: AIMNR H10 R.MAIN +33 309
>Dave: CDGIIMR 15D DICI.G +12 337
#note This still seems totally right to me, both because the N was his most likely place to bingo and in order to turn over as many tiles as possible to try to get one of those blanks.
>Adam: BG L3 B.G +19 328
>Dave: BEEFIMR 1L BRI. +10 347
#note I had to block TOASTING.  Now if he just managed to leave one of the blanks in the bag, I will win.
>Adam: ??INOST 5C iNO.ITeS +62 390
#note Nope.  Adam told me he got the second blank on his last draw.
>Adam:  (EEFMT) +20 410
#note Usually, you'd think that if you had limited Adam Logan to 328 points and no bingos by the time the bag had emptied, you'd be in good shape.
