#note PREX is a bit better.  Keeping the extra E and more bingo lines open is worth a little something, but not five points here.

#note So much for my chance to demolish him.
>Dave: DEHILOS 14E .H +26 214
#note Very close call between this and OHO.  There are quite a few tiles I can draw to bingo, but it's also quite likely that many of them could get blocked by his next play.

>Dave: DEILOOS 6F DO.E +16 230
#note This is one of those really tough in-between situations where I don't have ways to score much, and the board is still bingoable, but it's not certain that bingos will fit.  My general sense is that an in-between move which still scores decently well but doesn't break up the rack too much is the right idea, but I'm not sure whether I did it very well.  Maybe OLIO 5J?  Meanwhile, I have my eye on drawing the M for MISBRANDS for six turns in a row.

>Dave: CEILOOS 5B LOCO +18 248
#note With the last play making bingos even tougher, I thought it was time to start going for points and scoring tiles more aggressively, hence I preferred this to COO in the same spot.
>John: PRZ K2 PR.Z +30 253
>Dave: EEIILOS 12L OI +14 262
#note Didn't really have a choice here, but this didn't seem bad at all with only one L unseen.
>John: ABELNRU N8 NEBULAR +83 336
#note Doh!
>Dave: DEEIILS 8L DI.E +21 283
#note DIESEL O4 is a lot more points but is tantamount to giving up the game.  He will block the A line, and there's no hope of ever bingoing on this board again.  I'm still hoping to hit MISBRANDS, which might be enough to get me back in the game without a bingo.
>John: AGOTT O3 TOGAT. +8 344
>Dave: AEILSUV L4 .AVE. +20 303
#note VILLAGE B2 is a nice daredevil play I didn't think of, which hopes to draw something to fit on row 1 or column A, but the tile pool does not inspire much hope.
>John: IO G13 IO. +10 354
#note I knew he must have had the blank when he made a move like this.
>Dave: ILSUUWY 3C ULU +10 313
#note UWY draw?  The tile gods had it in for me this round.
>John: ?EEEIMT O12 sEEM +22 376
#note Of course I'm sitting there thinking, "Dammit, I've wanted to play MISBRANDS all game, he draws the damn thing and doesn't see it."
