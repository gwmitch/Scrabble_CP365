#note Sadly, SNEEZER won't play, and Mike didn't give me a needed I. Q slightly prefers GEEZ, GEEZER, HAZER, and SNEEZE at J2.

#note Wasn't crazy about this play. Neither is Q, as it isn't on its list. 4K RUED 33, or just RUE, keeping the D to hook in two spots. I whiffed, but I also wanted to open the board holding the blank...

#note Good game, Jim! Er, um, Mike! (Al mistakenly turned in a scoresheet with "Jim P" written on it, later claiming he mixed up the name of the former basketball player, and father of John Paxson, who played on the Bulls championship teams with Michael Jordan). It became a running joke for the weekend...
