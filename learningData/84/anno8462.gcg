>Ian_Weinstein: ABIKT 8H BATIK +32 32
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIINV J6 VI.AE +18 18
#note Sims a couple points ahead of the field. INVITEE is nice statically but doesn't play great defense.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEHMOS M3 MAHOES +36 68
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEINTT L8 .ITTEN +20 38
#note Not so great. Sim prefers TEE N4, which I considered, but it just felt wrong to give Ian such easy counterplays. Keeping EE with KITTEN is pretty weak, though.
>Ian_Weinstein: FNU L4 FUN +29 97
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEOOOS H7 O.OE +6 44
#note This looks really stupid, but I'm pretty sure it's best.
>Ian_Weinstein: DN 9G D.N. +11 108
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEEOSU K10 AE +11 55
#note Don't care what Quackle says, I hate EAU K11. Taking away an S-hook lane is a terrible idea. ODEA M11 -- exact same problem. Perhaps I should have considered UDO K11, though. I dunno, I was just desperately trying to find some way to dump vowels that scored more than, like, five points.
>Ian_Weinstein: IIIII -IIIII +0 108
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEGOSU N2 DUG +21 76
#note The sim likes GENU 13J, which forks open bingo lines N and 14. An interesting idea that I didn't think of.
>Ian_Weinstein: FNOS O1 FONS +41 149
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEGOSS 13J GE.OA +12 88
#note Sim prefers AGONE in the same spot. Sure, it's two points more, but I wanted a more aggressive play to open a TWS line. Down 73, that seems to make sense to me.
>Ian_Weinstein: ELOZ N10 ZOE.L +68 217
#note ...although it does enable him to do that.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EERSST 11B EaSTERS +69 157
#note There are 87 possible bingos here (I got really bored and counted). Quackle likes VERSETS best for defense; I liked this for slotting the E's under TLS squares and opening a little volatility. Shrug. Whatever.
>Ian_Weinstein: CIRX B10 X.RIC +60 277
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIJORT O7 JOTA +44 201
#note RIOJA is better. I should be conserving that T with only one left. Plus, you know, points are nice.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?AGNPRW F10 P.W +14 273
#note Saw all three bingos in line 1 (WRAPPING, PRAWNING, PARAWING), but decided to pass 'em up and try to find something better next turn. Probably a dumb idea. This board is gross.
>Ian_Weinstein: AEILRUV 14A A.ERVULI +65 430
