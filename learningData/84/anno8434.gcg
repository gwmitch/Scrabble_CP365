#note VINOS C9 leads the sim by a little bit. I considered that, but I kinda liked the volatile option that opens an S-hooking lane keeping BLS?. With only a small early lead, figured it couldn't hurt to play a little more open.

#note Um, not a good play. Missed MYOMA and CYMOL at the bottom right. I tunneled in on this J spot, stupidly.

>Evans_Clinchy: ACIMMOZ N10 MA.ZO +44 298
#note Wow, COLZA for 78. Just completely missed it. Awful. That woulda been 74.70 percent to win; instead this is 58.34.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AEX H1 AX.E +36 296
>Evans_Clinchy: CIMOTUW 15L WOT +27 325
#note Major turning point. I figured I had to take this spot, both for the points and for blocking the juiciest bingo line, since I think Brian has the second blank. Quackle disagrees. I guess that because MATZO takes HST hooks and I have the last of those tiles, I should hold onto the T and play elsewhere. The top simming moves are COWY O9 and MOW L7.

#note Best. Nice play.
>Evans_Clinchy: CFIMORV 6B COVI. +20 413
#note Also best. Can't block the CAGE spot in a way that scores decently, so just take points.
