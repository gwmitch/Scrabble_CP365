#note Other options are OY, YO, ION K5, exchange IO, exchange O and (A)I. I think exchange IO is better than this. After this, Zamez can block stuff off and make lots of bingoes not fit. Exchanging O might bingo more than YO or OY, since spots often get blocked by Zamez, and they also open up great scoring places. EIINRT is really quite good. ION just doesn't seem that great, blocking some potentially useful lanes. EINRT is apparently better than EIINRT, so I guess I'd exchange IO in hindsight. OI sims best, but I think Quackle might underestimate Zamez's blocking potential.

#note I just couldn't come up with much to be satisfied with here. None of the options are that great, so I thought this was fine, saving good tiles, but not giving away big scores. But how worried should I be about big scores? This game is confusing...

#note PUTAMEN, this, MUN, UNMET and MUN, and PUN are all options. I dunno. The bingo lanes aren't looking so friendly here, so maybe just something like UNMET or PUTAMEN or PERM? This seems alright, but this is another case of baffledness.

#note I thought of GA(V)E, but not of MO(V)E. Maybe that's better here, keeping a stabler leave and blocking a good scoring spot? Then again, is it worth keeping the O to use for SO or something? These seemed okay, scoring well, and EOS is fine I hik.
