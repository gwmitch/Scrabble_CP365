#note Static evaluator prefers CHEGOE by a fair margin, but I dunno.  I'm already part way toward one of the extensions, and I think I'd rather have EE than U as a leave.  There's also a better chance of good scoring parallel plays after CHEGOE.  I'd sim it if I weren't so lazy.

#note I suppose it would have been too greedy to ask for that S to stay open.
>Dave: BEEINOT M8 .BONITE +31 171
#note I'd take this over BOITE L1 regardless of what the sim says, and that's entirely because of the game score.

#note I accidentally overscored this by 3, and neither of us caught it.

#note Pretty lame, but I saw that  she might have AILMENT/ALIMENT on row 14 and wanted to block it.  At first I was going to play GROK G10, but I thought that would just give up easy points on the H column.  The much nicer and smarter way to block the lane was ANORAK.
