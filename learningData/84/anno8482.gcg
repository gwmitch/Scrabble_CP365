#note Quackle likes the other placement better. Not sure why? Adding RE to the beginning would be too easy for my opponent.

>them: AEEHNRT K5 HEARTEN +101 121
#note I was psyched that I bingoed first.. til this.
>me: ?FGOOSV L3 GOOF +26 89
#note Whoops, it's 8 more points on the other side. My eye should be drawn to the TLS space, but for some reason it wasn't.
>them: BE J10 BE +22 143
>me: ?ORRRSV 11G R.V.. +8 97
#note 'I'll be checking this move on quackle', I said. Q likes (BE)VOR better, which I don't like, if I'm going to make a low scoring play I'd rather keep at least one vowel.

#note Luckily, it worked out.

#note Mike's not letting me off easy.

>me: ?EFILNO E3 FLExION +70 241
#note LObEFIN? Well I was was looking for a word ending in IN, but I didn't know it. OLEFINs I saw for one more point, but figured I'd play the less common one. 
>them: ACCEIO 4B COE.IAC +28 237
#note Here's the thing with Mike: there's a 50-50 chance that this word is either good or bogus. Fortunately after holding, I convinced myself that it might be another spelling of CELIAC. I was right.
>me: AINPWXY D8 WAXY +33 274
#note Wow, D8 YAWPIN(G) for 52. I don't think I even knew YAWP. WIN(G)Y is next, with my play coming in 3rd. I liked the idea of scoring and keeping the X but couldn't find anything that came close, and I can't expect to beat Mike without high scoring plays.
>them: DEJK C3 J.KED +38 275
#note See.
>me: IMNPRRT B6 MINT +25 299
#note I don't like anything that leaves me four consonants here, even though Q says L8 NIT. Just learned PIRN but haven't seen it enough times yet, I would've played it for the MRT leave instead of PRR. I'll end up playing off PRR on my next turn...
>them: MU A7 MU +24 299
>me: EINPPRR J2 P.RR +18 317
#note P(U)R with the S unseen? Uh, no. Now if I knew I was going to draw it...
Anyways I like my play, even if Q doesn't. It seems to be the best scoring one while keeping a decent leave with a slightly wacky tile pool.
>them: ALOT 15A ALTO +19 318
>me: AEEINPS L8 NAE +24 341
#note Again, it's too close to fish. Best.
>them: OY 10A OY +31 349
#note Oy, indeed. Now I really wish I'd remembered PIRN.
>me: EEIPSTU 13B PIE +14 355
#note I spent a lot of time on this play. (TA)U sims highest, and I guess 9 out of 14 of the unseen tiles form a bingo, but that means I pretty much have to bingo to win. M8 SUPE for 32 scores the most, but I didn't see it. I ended up deciding to take out this lane since it seemed the easiest place to score with a Z, plus I get to keep the S and hopefully use it to score next turn. It works out.
>them: EILOT M10 TELOI +16 365
#note What I didn't realize is that if he had ZA, it plays at 14A for 43 now...
>me: AESTTUZ N6 ZETAS +45 400
#note Of course, I didn't see 14A ZA, but it's just as well because it's a losing play. Glad I saved the S now!
>them: ADEHIN O6 AHI +40 405
#note I hoping I wasn't missing anything better than this.
>me: TU F6 UT +9 409
#note 13F TU(G) is one more point.
