>scott_jackson: HIIORUY -IIOUY +0 22
#note Better to keep the Y also with the G10 spot, plus a vowel. I didn't bother since there's a decent chance an E gets put there first. 
>opponent: AK 7H KA +21 42

#note best
>opponent: ADIQ 13A QAID +37 103
>scott_jackson: BEIIRTW 8A TWI.E +30 183
#note best. TWIBI(L) leaves ER but doesn't score enough to compensate. 
>opponent: EMNORTT J1 TORMENT +70 173
>scott_jackson: BFINPRU B12 F.B +16 199
#note I really wanted to ditch BFU but I didn't see BU(M)F. There's nothing on the triple line that gives a leave with any synergy. Best is BUN(T), my play is a couple % points back. 
>opponent: AEILN 1H EN.AIL +21 194
>scott_jackson: IILNPRU 5E UNPIL. +16 215
#note Awkward rack. Should've played PU(R)LIN instead but I missed it. My play gives too many easy scoring hooks. 
>opponent: AENRY 4A YEARN +26 220
>scott_jackson: EINORTW 3F INTE.ROW +76 291
>opponent: DE 1H ......ED +27 247
>scott_jackson: BOOOPVY 4L YOB +31 322
#note 3A BOYO, which also blocks any big thread ending at F2. My play is second best, but by an 8% margin. 
>opponent: ELM A1 ELM. +27 274
>scott_jackson: GOOPRSV B6 VO. +17 339
#note I didn't like SOPOR/SPOOR because the leave is so awkward. I like to ditch the V and the doubled O if at all possible, hence VOW. Quackle still likes the S plays though as well as GOOP 2C. 
>opponent: DGINSTU K5 DUSTING +116 390
#note DUSTIN hits DUSTING, ouch!
>scott_jackson: AEGOPRS 2E APO +23 362
#note 2D GAP preferred somewhat. I would've played OP if there weren't three A's still unseen. 
>opponent: AAII -AAII +0 390
>scott_jackson: AEEGRSV 2A .EV +12 374
#note Simulalation prefers 04 SAVER by a few % points.
>opponent: ARSZ 8K .ZARS +72 462
#note Ouch. And leaving one in the bag as well. Anything less and I can bingo out to win, having just picked up the blank. 
>scott_jackson: ?AEGIRS 15B SERInGA +83 457
#note Nothing wins, as I expected. If there wasn't the threat of QAT in the bottom left I would play C2 V(I)A. I also can't maximize my score with SAGGIER because that would give big points back to the H. 
>opponent: ADEHIOT 14E HEAT +22 484
>scott_jackson: U 10J U. +4 461
#note nice game. The closest I can get if is the T (lose by 9) or A (lose by 11) is in the bag. 
>scott_jackson:  (DIO) +8 469
