>Randy_Morrison: FGHSSSX -FGSSX +0 0
#note I told him to keep HS.  SS is the only thing Q evaluates better.  Sim says... after 1000 2-ply S and HSS are up 50%.  SS and HS are 3rd and 4th.
>Ryan_Fischer: BCIOORY 8H CORBY +32 32
#note Q evals BOYO .2 above this even though it scores 14 less(!!).
>Randy_Morrison: HIKS J6 KI. +17 17
>Ryan_Fischer: AIINOPS I7 P.I +16 48
#note Yeah, shoulda figured POI is better, but needed an S hook.  Q likes 9I PSOAI 35.
>Randy_Morrison: AX 7L AX +22 39
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEINOS K8 .EDSONIA +72 120
#note Totally whiffed on (C)ODEINAS.  Whoops!  'course I know of diocesan codeinas; just didn't see the spot.  I'd get the spot later at least.
>Randy_Morrison: EHNS 15K .SHEN +27 66
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADIIOR 13E RADIOI.g +61 181
#note I SAW (C)ARDIOId!  Missed the spot again!  And I really thought what I play next was oh so clever!

>Ryan_Fischer: AEGNOTV H8 .OVET.NG +47 228
#note CONATIVE fits there too.  V(I)GA is 3rd.
>Randy_Morrison: EGO E11 GO.E +10 101
>Ryan_Fischer: AABERRS 15A BARER +30 258
#note If no POI then BARESARK plays!  I forget GORER* is bogus.  It's ROGER.  Q says (K)ABAR is best.

>Ryan_Fischer: ADEINPZ 3E ..Z +25 484
#note Champ says B10 PI 23 (or PA).  I just fished the Z for the hell of it.  I didn't track, and sure didn't *expect* to pull another bingo.  It sims fairly well for the short time I ran it.
