#note The sim gives the edge to FED. BLMS is nice synergy, and FEM gives up the E hook.
>Logan: ?AEHHNT 10D HeATHEN +75 89
#note Yup. Shoulda done FED.

#note Adam took this over other solid options to kill HEATHENS after I telegraphed an S.

#note Almost windmilled (BA)CK before I stopped to think. Not only is CK more likely to save a consonant heavy leave, but I am setting up a big CLANK/CLINK/CLONK/CLUNK if I pull the right vowel. And of course, setting up my S on row 15 is great.

#note Of course, now that I've drawn CLONK, I talk myself out of it. Stupid!! KEX is a weak fish, but it looks pretty okay considering I need some major luck at this point. KOS just didn't seem like it was going anywhere. But yeah, CLONK is obviously the play.

#note There's no real way this game can be won. Just playing for a pity bingo at this point. But with the 8-14 con-vowel ration, I can probably safely do IF here.
