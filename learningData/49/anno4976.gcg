#note "Haha! I've got you now!"
>Matthew: ADILNOS 12G N.L +3 11
#note "Yes, it seems you've finally got me, Mr. Ulu."
>Mr._Ulu: IINOOPT 15F PO.ITION +61 153
#note "Any last words?"
>Matthew: AADIOST E7 A.O +2 13
#note "Actually, before you do me in, I have one final request."
>Mr._Ulu: BIIKNOT G8 .ITO. +16 169
#note "Which is?"
>Matthew: ACDIOST 9D I.D..S +11 24
#note "Tell me, Mr. Ulu, how you came to be a supervillain and why your one aspiration is to rule the Scrabble world."
>Mr._Ulu: BBIKNOY 13H .IB +9 178
#note "Oh no, I'm not falling for that one!"
>Matthew: AACEORT L12 TAC. +12 36
#note "Why, whatever could you mean?"
>Mr._Ulu: BKNORUY D9 .NKY +22 200
#note "I've seen the movies. The villain has the hero by the throat and gets distracted explaining his plot for world domination, only to have his plans foiled."
>Matthew: AAEEEOR 14L .ORE +14 50
#note "Oh come on. I know you can't resist a monologue. Besides, you have this game firmly in hand. What could happen?"
>Mr._Ulu: BCEORUU M11 BOR.. +20 220
#note "I suppose a 150 point lead is basically insurmountable. Very well. My story begins in Uruguay..."
>Matthew: AAAEEIY 12C A.E +6 56
#note "That's predictable..."
>Mr._Ulu: ACELLUU J13 .U. +7 227
#note "Hey! Did you know the "mono" in "monologue" means "one"?! As in only one of us can logue. This is not a bilogue or a multilogue or whatever the heck a two-person conversation would be called!"
>Matthew: AAEEILY 13A AYE +16 72
#note "Okay! Yeesh. Sorry..."
>Mr._Ulu: ACEELLU F13 CE. +9 236
#note "As I was saying. I'm was born in Uruguay in August, 19U4."
>Matthew: ADEHILO 10A LAI. +6 78
#note "(Man these U jokes are going to get old soon...)"
>Mr._Ulu: AEHLLSU B6 ALUL.E +8 244
#note "My parents, Ursulus and Fred, had another son. One they favored more than me."
>Matthew: DEHOOST 9A E. +4 82
#note "Dude. As if you used the American spelling."
>Mr._Ulu: EEHMRST A5 SHE +13 257
#note "That's right. I had a brother. Senor Bunch."
>Matthew: DHOOSTU 14A DO +19 101
#note "I mean the Canadian spelling even lets you use another U. What the hell, man?"
>Mr._Ulu: EEGMRTW 6A ..RT +7 264
#note "Yes. Senor Neb Bunch. My parents wanted him to carry on the family tradition. I come from a long line of U-masters, you see."
>Matthew: HOPSTUV A12 H.. +11 112
#note "Zzz..."
>Mr._Ulu: DEEGMTW F8 ..EM +22 286
#note "But only one of us could inherit the family business. And they chose him."
>Matthew: AOPSTUV C4 TO.S +9 121
#note "I wonder if anyone's actually played ZZZ in a game?"
>Mr._Ulu: DEGRRTW 4C .EG +8 294
#note "I was so mad."
>Matthew: AFMPUUV E2 VU. +7 128
#note "I mean not as some stupid play. I wonder if ZZZ is ever actually the best play."
>Mr._Ulu: DRRRTVW 3D W.D +12 306
#note "I vowed revenge. I travelled to the only other place where the U-power can rival Uruguay: Tuktoyaktuk. There I trained under the Eskimos."
>Matthew: AFIJMPUX 14D AP. +5 133
#note "They prefer Inuit."
>Mr._Ulu: DERRRTV -  +0 306
#note "Once I had mastered the ways of the Ulu knife, I travelled back to Uruguay and captured my parents and brother. I froze them in ice and vowed to thaw them only once I have overtaken the world with my U-power. Then they will be my slaves."
>Matthew: FJMQUXZ B13 ..U +6 139
#note "Oh, are you done?"
>Mr._Ulu: DERRRTV D14 .T +3 309
#note "Yes! Weren't you paying attention?!"
>Matthew: FIJMQXZ 5C .F +15 154
#note "Oh, er... yes! I especially loved the part about the... leprechaun?"
>Mr._Ulu: DEERRRV O8 VERDER.R +167 476
#note "You mock me! Now I will finish you once and for all!"
>Matthew: AIJMQXZ -  +0 154
#note "Challenge. Oh it's good. Lucky guess."
>Mr._Ulu: ?EF N9 FE +16 492
#note "Mwahaha!"
>Matthew: AIJMQXZ 12L ..M. +6 160
#note Matthew: "Dude. You totally could have gone out there."
#note Ulu: "I know, but I decided to give you one last breath of air before I end this. I like to play with my food before I devour it!"
#note Matthew: "But... what if I, like... stick you with that blank and then tile out for 300+ points to win?"
#note Ulu: "Don't be preposterous! That would be impossible!"
