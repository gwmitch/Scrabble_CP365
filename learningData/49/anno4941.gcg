#note I think I just sort of refused to believe this rack didn't bingo. So I kept coming back to LMNRTAEO because I just knew there was a word there. As I realised later, the word I was thinking of was Montreal and LAMENTOR* is the phony I always anagram when I see that word on road signs. Durr.

#note Quite a few dumping options here. 9B UNAI sims best. BEDOUIN and BEAU are interesting too.

#note I don't like a lot of the options Quackle suggests. It feels like I need to bingo to win this game, and C12 WIG or FIG won't help me do that. I don't want to close lines and I don't want a shitty leave. Trading doesn't sim too badly, but Q says it's not the time, yet.
