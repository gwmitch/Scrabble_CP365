#note I guess it's either this or exchange - probably right to take the 10 points and the star.

#note Not a good move. While this is defensively okay, the vowel-heavy leave is a major problem. YOGEE/DIDY is a big improvement.
>Carl: ACEMRTT D4 TA +7 155
#note Interesting idea - not sure I would have thought of this. He does need to keep the board open, and Quackle's choice of MET 7H is far too easy to defend.
