>Goofus: ?CCEHKNOPRU 8A COCKPUNcHER +168 168
#note To my great surprise, Gallant insta-challenged this...of course the word came back good, and I rode him mercilessly both to and from the challenge station: "Duh! One who punches people in the cock? How could you challenge that?" Maroon.
>Gallant: EINRSTW -  +0 0
#note So okay, I challenged a bit hastily. We got back, he drew his new tiles...and then it dawned on me, wait, his opening play contained 11 tiles - clearly a regulation has been contravened? So I called the director over, his name was Mr. Wire or Weer or something, and explained him the deal. He then looked right at Goofus and said, "Now cut out that funny stuff", and left before I could say any more. Oh well, down 168, lemonade from lemons and all that. (Neither of us noticed that the play should have been scored as 218 until Quackling it later.)
>Goofus: AAALNRX C8 .ARNALAX +86 254
#note Deep bingo knowledge I have. Deep! I also like strip clubs.
>Gallant: EINRSTW G8 .W +9 9
#note A mere bingo won't do here; I've got to at least take one shot at the Tabasco sombrero.
>Goofus: AIMSTTV I1 MITSVAT. +68 322
#note MITSVO, MITSVAT, MITSVATH, MITSVAGIHIM...
>Gallant: EEINRST 5E STER.INE +94 103
#note Have to keep the 3x3 lanes clear, I think.
>Goofus: OOOSTVW 13A VO.OST +9 331
#note No explanation necessary.
>Gallant: ADGGIII 4B GIGI +14 117
#note Scrabbler reference, free of charge.
>Goofus: EIJNOUW F10 JEW. +30 361
#note Yeah, Quackle hates it, sue me.
>Gallant: ADDEINQ J2 QI +64 181
#note Some respite for a weary traveler, a man of Willowdale...
>Goofus: IIINOPU K8 .IUPIONI +70 431
#note Five. Vee. Eight. Hizz.
>Gallant: ADDENUY L2 UND.ADY +63 244
#note Oddly, I was 100% sure of this hook. Had mixed feelings about taking it, though, since it obviated the possibility of the -DOMS extension. These are the sorts of subtle considerations that top players of many years' standing take into account.
>Goofus: ADENOOT 15B E.ODONTA +101 532
#note Took the lower-scoring bingo for defense; the 3x3 ONO(I)DATE opens up too much.
>Gallant: BEFFMST 1H F. +21 265
#note (No static at all)
>Goofus: AABGHIL 12H GAL.BIAH +90 622
>Goofus: AABGHIL --  -90 532
#note Not one of the 137 legal spellings, apparently.
>Gallant: BEEFMST 15K .MBET +36 301
#note Quackle estimates my winning percentage at -13.4% at this juncture. Yes, this means that my chances of winning the *next* game have been reduced by 13.4%.
>Goofus: AABGHIL N10 GAIBL. +26 558
#note I didn't even bother to think whether this was good or not. I'm up by 200+, might as well just start making shit up.
>Gallant: EEFRRRS 2L .RF +12 313
#note I do have the case S, such as it is.
>Goofus: ?AAEHLL B11 AH.L. +27 585
#note Again, no explanation necessary.
>Gallant: EEOORRS 14J E.O +9 322
#note "Music For Airports" was my favorite album, I think.
>Goofus: ?AEEELU L13 E.. +7 592
>Gallant: EEORRSZ O2 SERREZO +108 430
#note A serrezo is a revolutionary who has spilled blood for his cause. That's according to my dictionary at home; the Scrabble dict says that a serrezo is a "angry red person -S".
>Goofus: ?ADEELU B1 LAU.ED +24 616
#note tournaments ought to be determined by spread!!!1!!!
>Gallant: Y 13K ..Y. +18 448
#note Invoking the rarely called upon "emergency Clabbers" clause for my out play.
>Gallant:  (E?) +2 450
