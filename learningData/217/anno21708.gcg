#note Why do I keep letting my opponents play phony fives on me? I held for about two minutes but let it go in the end. There's some momentum to be gained here if I challenge.
>Charles_Reinke: EHHIOUU 5K HUH +28 169
#note I8 (B)I(J)OU is nice. At least I'm saving those letters for next turn!

>Charles_Reinke: EEIIOUW -EIIOUW +0 169
#note Nope, still don't see it.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAOORRY C12 YA +21 286
#note I had no idea what to do here. Everything scores poorly and keeps a weak leave. C11 ORA is the exception, but do I really want to open the left side of the board? Probably. There's also K9 AGORA which at least accomplishes something on that side of the board. Though the E hook is risky. YA is bad. 6-7 pts back in the sim. Weak!
>Charles_Reinke: ABENOQW 8L A.EW +24 193
#note E(N)OW is way better. 
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIOORRT K9 A.OROT +16 302
#note Part of a two-turn plan to kill this quadrant.
>Charles_Reinke: BEMNOPQ L1 MOB +19 212
#note I didn't see the higher-scoring (R)EBOP or EN(T)OMB. It might be worthwhile to leave those bingo lines open for now, though.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IKOORSU 12H KOU.OI +30 332
#note I should mention at this point that I need to win this game to clinch a playoff spot. If you think my plays look paranoid, that's because I was playing super paranoid!. ROOKIE is a lot of points to pass up. I just wanted to delay Charles' bingo as long as possible so that I could outrun him. I probably should not have deviated so much from my typical play style in these games.

>Charles_Reinke: DISTTVW 3G W.D +19 319
#note No good way to open the board here. I'm pretty much guaranteed to lose I think. Quackle likes F4 VI(E)D a lot for some reason.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEGLRS O6 LA.S +20 390
#note You know you've reached critical paranoia levels when you're blocking eights that end in W. Burning the S could make things dicey for me next turn if Charles creates an S setup. Probably not worth it considering I'm blocking literally one bingo. (He's more likely to bingo through EL.) I was really nervous about this game, if you can't tell. Wanted that 14 wins!
>Charles_Reinke: EINSTTV 13B T.. +3 322
#note Matthew will be able to block this setup if he has any vowels at all, but it was worth a try.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEEGNR 14A NE +8 398
>Charles_Reinke: CEINSTV N8 ..N +5 327
#note I was fishing for an R so I could try a phony VERTIC(EL)S* because it's all I saw. Even if I somehow get to play it I'm going to lose anyway.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEEGRT 1G G.. +4 402
#note More extreme paranoia. This does block SEMIVOWEL, though!
>Charles_Reinke: CEIMSTV M11 V.M +16 343
#note Scored as 14. It's like I want to lose.
