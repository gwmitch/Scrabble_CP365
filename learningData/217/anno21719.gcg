>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEEHNOO C9 .EECHO +22 68
#note 9G HOE is definitely better. Not sure why I didn't play that. Very clear mistake

#note I spent forever on this turn. Nothing really stands out, but maybe I should sacrifice some points to keep that D out of the triple line

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ILOQTV A1 VOLTI +30 265
#note QI was tempting, but VOLT? isn't going to bingo or do much of anything on this board very often. VOLTI at least has some promise: digging deep into a bag with UUSSZ unseen.
>Jesse_Day: FI 13F IF +20 285
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AGIIQW -AGIIQW +0 265
#note Horrible error at a crucial junction. The Q setup with WIGAN will basically never stay open, but at least it's a better plan than taking 0. I needed to stay within striking distance.

#note MEGAFAUNA H1. It would have lost anyway, with what was in the bag
