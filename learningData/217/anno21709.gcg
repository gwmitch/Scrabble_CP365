#note Disclaimer: this was the last round of the day before the playoffs and both Orry and I were clinched. We were surprised to find our rather meaningless game was at Board 1. Both of us having played high-pressure games all day, I'm not sure either of us tried as hard as we probably should have.

#note Interesting position. I decided to be greedy and keep the blank while setting up an X spot. I like it!

#note Yeah it's a bizarre choice to pass up 10 pts from INCASED or even 4 pts from MONACIDS. I kind of deliberately took the weird play to see what would happen. After this play, I can kill the board very quickly. My lead isn't actually big enough for this kind of hijinx. Oh, and I completely missed NONACIDS for 89. Yeah... wasn't all there this game.
