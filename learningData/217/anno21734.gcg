#note it is super frustrating that i could not use the spot at 15H with any F play!! it's also frustrating that AUBERGE fit nowhere a few turns ago and even with my bingo my win % now is actually pretty low. I really, really should have just taken the points here though, this is a pretty big mistake. i would have against a top player, but i wanted to decrease volatility somehow, but if she has the S (or the Y) i am pretty boned. -3

#note i have NO idea what to choose between LIRI and RIN. quackle likes LIRI equity-wise but by win % it's pretty close. either way i need to bingo like yesterday. -3

#note drawing RI again is just hilarious.

#note i know this isn't right, but i completely ran out of time. i could not figure out how to open to the left. maybe ETUI/MEOU aren't actually that easy to block though. i really should have done one of those as a backup, because URIC will never win even if i draw a bingo.
