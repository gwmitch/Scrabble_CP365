>Tony_Leah: EGHLY 8D HYLEG +32 32
>Evans_Clinchy: DEILRVX 9G XI +37 37
#note Close call between this and VEX. Interesting sim details on VEX - Tony will average about 3-4 points less than after XI, and I'll be 40.3 percent to bingo with DEILR. Maybe it's better.
>Tony_Leah: ENRSU 7C RUNES +30 62
>Evans_Clinchy: DEFLRSV 6B FEDS +31 68
#note *gulp* I guess it's closed board time. (I could play just FED, keeping the S for HYLEGS, but it felt right to take the points and clear out an extra consonant.)

#note Quackle loves plays that are super closed here, like ORAL or RORAL in line 13, but I don't think that line makes much sense against a human on a difficult board. With the blank in hand, I don't mind playing more open and going for the quick bingo.

#note Not sure if I see the appeal of fishing - sim recommends EGO G2, but I didn't feel like this board was open enough to make it work. I'm fine with taking the points here. (Though I wish I'd seen LOGGIE, keeping the case N instead of an O.)
>Tony_Leah: AIPP 1A PIPA +29 280
>Evans_Clinchy: AAMOOTV M1 .AVOT +18 300
#note Just gotta keep scoring and balancing here to stay competitive. This works OK. It sims second-best behind AVO 11E, a tight fit that I didn't see.
