#note I talked myself out of WILLIE here. Clear mistake. Need to study which words are good both -Y and -IE because this is a consistent error of mine.

#note It's important to note that I just need to not lose this game by 103 pts to win the match. So I'm playing this turn as if I have a 150-pt lead. I'm blocking the X bomb and the easy S-bingo line. I think it's fine.

#note Hyper defence against his S. Maybe it's silly, but the longer I hold him off his bingo, the harder it will be to catch my spread.

#note OWSE is clearly better. I was prety nervous this game and people were crowding around.

#note Srtting up a massive X bomb is risky. But he didn't have it when he did OOH.

#note Not quite sure what my logic was here. I should do J10 EDIFY to make it almost impossible for him to get the 2 bingos he needs to catch my match spread. This at least blocks one bingo lane. You can definitely see my nerves catching me in this game. I played better in the first 3.
