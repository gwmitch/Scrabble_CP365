>Evans_Clinchy: ILNOORT 8G LO +4 4
#note Quackle is rarely a fan of my goofy short openings, but this one actually sims best by a considerable margin. There just isn't an attractive alternative here. LOO, LOTION and exchanging are all pretty bad.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EWX I6 WEX +24 24
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EINORT 9C OTaRINE +79 83
#note Of course I get incredibly lucky and draw E? to my leave of INORT.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: TUV E8 V.UT +12 36
>Evans_Clinchy: AIMRSTW 8A MAW +29 112
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AEIRU 12B URAEI +17 53

>Brad_Whitmarsh: GNU 3J .UNG +14 109
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEEEOS 10I DEE +22 237
#note Sim recommends a more defensive play here since my rack isn't very good. DONEE L1 is nice and blocky. I can see that.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: BGNR B10 BR.NG +28 137
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEORSU L3 .EUROsES +69 306
#note Didn't see REPOUSSE 4E, but I'm fine with this play since it makes it a little tougher for him to land multiple bingos and come back.

>Brad_Whitmarsh: CIPTY N2 TYPIC +47 238
>Evans_Clinchy: ADIKLOP A4 KOP +31 400
#note Convinced myself that ATYPIC wasn't good! It is. I have KOAP for 58.

#note Messed up this endgame pretty bad. I'm supposed to play SAIL 8L to block his HIN outplay.
