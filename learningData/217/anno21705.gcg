#note I spent quite a bit of time here. Nothing is clearly best. I placed a bit too much value on leaving that floating N open for ING bingos. It was a bit too big a sacrifice ahead of 9F OGEE and 6I EGO. Only about a 2-pt error.

#note Obviously REWAXING is worth considering. 17 pts was too much for me to give up, though.

#note I thought I was forcing him to play GREENBUG or SUBGENRE by blocking his bingos up top. But I completely missed his OWL3 bingo on row 11! Good thing I didn't do something silly like 5A RESAT, thinking it blocked all his bingos.

#note Boy was I ever clueless on this turn. Any play worth playing opens up spots for Joey. In the end, I felt like it was most important to not open any bingo lines. FACEUP... kind of does... if you consider the Z bomb from O1 to be a bingo line. I still think it's fine, because what else is there to play?

#note I let my time tick low on the past couple turns and Joey is playing fast. This play is lame as lame can be. I tend to just grab points when I'm nervous and low on time. I can do better. Pretty hard to lose after this, though.
