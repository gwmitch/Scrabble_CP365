#note was pretty off here. I suspected exchanging or VOG would be a little better, but I forgot about VLOG. i didn't mind doing this too much, but I didn't think of VOLAR which is better as it doesn't take an S. -4.5
>irene: AEIPRSU I3 UPRAISE +71 71
#note she might try upraiser if i do VOLAR though. she said she wanted to try it.
>cesar: EGGOQTY 9E GOY +25 49
#note EGGORTY looked familiar as a rack, but because i don't know my words very well i was unable to find TOGGERY - this is a very big mistake. GORGETY looked dumb as a word, and i had a feeling i was missing something. -11.5

#note around this time i started to have a feeling i would not draw anything for the rest of this game. this doesn't happen often, if at all, and especially not when i am significantly higher rated than my opponent. since she was at 4-0 and i was at 3-1 i needed to win this game to have a shot at winning. i didn't play the other WAWL because i didn't want to give up easy points, but maybe i should make the board a little more open. -1
>irene: IRS 11C SIR +27 139
#note she likely has another S, and hopefully low scoring letters.
>cesar: EEGILNT 2J G.INE +26 118
#note i did not want to fish. it's a good leave and there's an R open, but J6 ET for 10 points does not seem like it will bingo often enough to be worth it. i also thought maybe i could bait an S hook on this. -2.5

#note i'm not going to draw well. EEL > EEN though. 5D TEENER looks best. this is also a pretty big mistake, especially if i think she kept a good leave, but who knows what she kept. -4

#note here i am just going for JEEZ for 90 points. i have no other chance. i don't know why quackle likes 14E TUFA besides keeping the E? if i play anywhere there she's likely to take row 15. it's unfortunate that LUNET gives up a bunch of points, though, because even JEEZ wouldn't be enough.
