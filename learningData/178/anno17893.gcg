#note I wasnt 100% sure POMO took an S so I didn't play that. It's simming ~1.5 points over LOOPY. I guess I will say "OOOOPSY!" to that miss.

#note several N4 bingos score 3 more points than this, but give a lot back. I saw (and originally laid down) pEREONS 12A, but decided that I didn't like giving back B10.

#note actual rack

#note I've mistracked and see an unseen P instead of that G. I didn't see anything in the pool, and knew i'd survive anything I overlooked, so I just played twenty.
