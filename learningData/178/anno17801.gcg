#note This is the game for second place; my brother had clinched the devision last game.

>Thomas_Reinke: AILLMMU I7 M.MI +30 116
#note Seemed like every candidate play opened too much stuff. This play sims best, which absolutely validates the time I spent on it.
>Paul_Epstein: AY K4 AY +25 125
>Thomas_Reinke: ADILLRU N6 URIAL +18 134
#note I hated this play after what came next, but it's apparently a victim of hindsight bias since it sims fine.
>Paul_Epstein: AEINSST O2 TISANES +84 209
>Thomas_Reinke: CDJLSVY -CDJLVY +0 134
#note Quackle has a bunch of cockamamie suggestions that include keeping other letters or even scoring points. Those suggestions, as previously indicated, are cockamamie and can be rejected outright.

#note Scrabble really is all about timing.
>Paul_Epstein: G K3 G.. +7 249
>Thomas_Reinke: ABELNNS 11E BAN. +12 232
#note Quackle wants 14G BEND. What am I gonna do after that? Might as well move an extra tile and try to get an I. That's right, I'm making a conscious effort to draw more I's. If you don't want to deal with it then you can just leave. You heard me.

>Paul_Epstein: BEJLNOX -  +0 263
#note Challenged. I was fairly sure but when an 1900 player challenges you even QI starts seeming weird on the way to the challenge computer.

>Thomas_Reinke: ACEGNPT N12 NAP +24 376
#note I should be blocking lanes I just opened up.
>Paul_Epstein: FO 15E OF +12 315
>Thomas_Reinke: EGJLTTX 13J .X +9 385
#note Luckily I can dump one of the scorers and not empty the bag.
>Paul_Epstein: ?ACINOR 3D CAROmIN. +62 377
#note 12J ZA gives me a chance to mess up, if he draws the Y he can play CORNIFY or something if I don't block. He passed up E1 bingos citing unknown high scoring comeback plays, probably assuming I had the Y.
>Thomas_Reinke: EGJLTTU B10 JU. +27 412
#note Almost played H1 JEML, I wasn't paying enough attention to the blank slip.
>Paul_Epstein: Y 7F .Y +11 388
>Paul_Epstein:  (GTTLE) +12 400
#note A fun end to a fun tournament. 15-5 +1078, a result I can attribute entirely to the Collins division's existence.
