>Chris: EGGIINO 8D GOING +18 18
#note Thought of GOING D8 and exchanging keeping GINE. I've never seen GIEING played even though obv GIED... GOING is winning the sim anyway, 1% up on GIEING in the same spot and 2% up on the exchange. 
>Matthew: AELNRUU 7F LUAU +14 14
#note This game is going well so far :) He scored 14 and the board is closing. I can't compete with Matthew on word knowledge so I need this lol. GOING did block NEURULA; sadly it didn't seem to tilt Matthew enough to cause him to make many mistakes this game :P

>Chris: AEEHIIX 6I XI +20 38
#note Though of this and AHI H9. Wanted to keep the board closed and put some points on the board, so played this. I think i like OHIA E8 now, since it keeps a much more dynamic leave and he could easily open a big X spot fot me after his response. 
>Matthew: BDN F6 B..ND +18 32
>Chris: AAEEHIO E3 OHIA +18 56
#note Thought of OHIA in 3 different spots and various exchanges, keeping AH or EH. Didn't consider D5 HOAGIE for 10, which is winning the sim. This placement was very unfortunate and Matthew pounced on it faster than a tenatcle snagging an unguarded muffin.
>Matthew: ADEMPRY 3C PY.DERMA +90 122
#note Nice lol. I had no idea whether it was good but I didn't challenge despite Matthew's reputation partly because of a conversation about phoneying that occurred at lunch and partly because he'd seen me challenge off 2 words in previous games and I don't think he knew much about my challenging tendencies before that. 
>Chris: ?AEEESW 4G SEAWEEd +84 140
#note The J2 spot is already dangerous anyway and this scores too much morethan K6 to not play it.
>Matthew: ACEOTVZ 2I AVOCET +60 182
#note He said he kept a Z here so he was gonna hit J2 anyway. Sick. I'm might just make Jeremy Hildebrand's suggested Bad Muffin t-shirt...
>Chris: EEEFILO D2 E.E +22 162
#note I thought the F was worth keeping here because of K5 and M1. M1 FEE and this are tied at the top of the sim. 
>Matthew: ISYZ N4 SIZY +46 228
>Chris: EFILLOT 1F FOIL +27 189
>Matthew: AGINRRS 10B GRAN.SIR +64 292
>Chris: EJLOORT 2B JO. +24 213
#note My racks get messy after this so they might not be 100% correct. 
>Matthew: DUW 1M WUD +28 320
>Chris: CDELRRT D8 .R.CED +20 233
#note DELT or CRED hooking GRANDSIRE keep some hope alive since they keep the board more open, but I whiffed on the GRANDSIRE hook despite knowing it or at least knowing that it made perfect sense. 
>Matthew: AEHMNT O7 ANTHEM +47 367
>Chris: KLNORRT 11K KRON. +18 251
#note All plays are now under 1% to win unsurprisingly. This is fine.
>Matthew: ?AEOOST -AEOOST? +0 367
#note Exch 7. Susurrus's favorite play ftw :)
>Chris: BILPRTT -BLIP +0 251
#note Change 4, didn't record rack
>Matthew: AEIU 13C A.IEU +14 381
>Chris: ?EOSTTT 13I TOTTErS +76 327
>Matthew: IQ 14B QI +24 405
>Chris: ABENOPT 12J TAE +21 348
#note Very bad. Missed TAN(GOING) and TEOPAN C15 but at least it doesn't affect my win % :P
>Matthew: EFILLV 15A VILL +38 443
#note TEOPAN would've prevented this too. 
>Chris: BNOP 14H BOP +26 374
>Matthew: EFR 15G FE +27 470
>Chris: N M13 .N +2 376
#note The game ended here. Maybe we were missing an R. Final score recorded at 472-373.
>Chris:  (R) +2 378
