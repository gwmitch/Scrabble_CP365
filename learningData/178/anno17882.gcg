#note Sims well along with ECHO...I wanted to keep CERU rather than ARU and sacrifice a few points.

>Joey_Krafchick: CERSSUU M7 URUS +16 341
#note I was kind of wanting to play US(H)ER, but leaving one U with an unseen U still late in the game is risky, so I figured I'm getting rid of both, scoring something, and I'm not creating a much better lane. I'm not actually sure if a bingo starting at M7 is more likely than something starting at N9, but with no blanks out I wasn't too paranoid.US(H)ER is +2 but URUS has a better win %
