#note Knowing that she probably knows JESTINGS, I want to know that out...and nicely enough it blocks 2 others lane and cuts the board off with the C!

#note With 5 unseen E's I'm not taking 6 less points to play less defense...Quackle says GO(L)F or F(L)OG are good

#note Quackle hates this but I see at as I'm taking a good amount of points to block the biggest threat on the board, by far. After this, even a blank only gets her a baby bingo anywhere, and I'm up 100. I was enticed to play ANUS for the flash, but I was disciplined enough, thankfully. And maybe I'll draw the blank anyway ;-)

#note I played this, despite the leave, because she can't cash in on this triple now, and no bingo chances are allowed with so unseen N's out for the -ING ending at 1H
