#note it may look ugly but it sims best. keeps the best leave and doesn't allow for any huge comeback plays.

#note was considering ELUTES 15a (29) but didn't even see EMULES# in the same spot for six more. although something shorter like ELM j4 (28) or even j5 EM (22) may be better options for the next rack or so. although i didn't feel too bad about FLUME.

#note nine in the bag, so i'm not out of it yet. but the board and the available tile pool (especially the J and X) suggest too many scoring opportunities to mount a complete comeback. that's why fishing is not an option. have to score some now, hope for a miracle soon after.

#note i mean, i could fish off the G and hope for ROPEWAY but he'll either block that or kill me with the J. (sidenote#: if someone who goes to watch a live performance is a PLAYGOER, then how come one who attends a religious service can't be a PRAYGOER*?)

#note the end result looks a lot closer than it really was. it's tough enough to beat this guy at any time, but even harder to do when you don't get the breaks.
