#note Pretty bad defensively. I should either take the solid equity play of (UN)ZIP or play ZIG L8 for the strong leave and defense.

#note Deserved that.

#note I figured that with a small lead and not many bingo lines available, it made sense to start closing the board. Quackle disagrees, simming both 2-ply and 4-. UVA# 13F, which I strongly considered, comes out looking best.

#note Quackle suggests ROUPING G5, which is balls-to-the-wall crazy but quite possibly brilliant - keeps RT, which is the perfect leave for this strong bingo-prone pool, and sets up an opening to bingo in line 4. I didn't really think to go that route - figured it made more sense to block up the existing bingo area and win ugly.

#note Damn, I had a good shot to win this game - I just didn't have enough time to think about why Rob passed and how to respond. If I figure out that he's plotting to bingo with a nine through PI, I can block and win! Either UNWIRE# or UNWARE# at 11C is the play here.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?EENORS G3 ENtRO..ES +62 441
#note Genius play by Rob - he knew all along that he had the bingo, but he waited to play it because I might have WATERIER 3A in response. Indeed I did. Game-winning pass!
