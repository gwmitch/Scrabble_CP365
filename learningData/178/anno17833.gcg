#note An interesting moment.  Normally I would take an easy 52 point play like AX J5 in a heartbeat when it keeps a dynamic 5 tile leave like CITER.  In most early game situations it is well worth doing that instead of a play for a dozen more points that breaks up the rack.  However, I didn't like what AX did to the board.  Suddenly, if he has an E, it's very likely that he will make a good scoring play on column K, due to all the back hooks for EA.  Once this happens, suddenly the board won't necessarily look very good for me to get bingos down.  Note that things would be very different if I had an S on my rack, due to PEAVEYS and SJOE#.  I could make a more defensive 52 point play of EX, since EE# doesn't have as many back hooks.  But I still run into the same problem that I may be leaving myself without a lot to do on the next turn.  For these reasons, it seemed to me to make more sense to take the higher scoring EXCRETA right away.  Interestingly, a two ply sim from Quackle favors AX by 3.7 over EXCRETA, and EX is about 1.8 behind EXCRETA.  However, after the game Geoff agreed with me in favoring EXCRETA because of how it controls the board.

#note I didn't think of WRAWL#, which scores 10 more points in the same spot.  It's probably somewhat better than my play, but not nearly a full 10 points better, both because it opens the triple lane and because the FRI leave is much stronger than FI.

#note This is such a nice play because it plays off exactly the letters I want to play and scores well for this board, but it's not nearly the best play.  This is a textbook example of "if you find a good move, look for a better one."  N1 INFER is 43 points, doesn't give too bad exposure to the triple lane because he needs an E for the O5 spot, and turns over a couple extra tiles with blanks unseen.

#note I'm happy with this play, which is tied for the highest scoring with FERRONIERE#, which we'd only likely see if Nigel Richards were playing.

>Dave_Koenig: ABCEGNT 9F GAB. +25 270
#note Another play I was quite happy with, as it scored well, kept a great leave, and took away his bingo lanes down columns F and J.  (Making SJOE# or JOES, for instance.)  It was immediately rewarded in a nice way.

#note A very nice play from Geoff attempts to keep making a fight of it, but unfortunately for him, I do not slow down.
