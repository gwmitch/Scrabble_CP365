The S hook is going to be important, so I'd better draw an S ASAP.

>Matt_Canik: AIRRSSU 8D U. +6 281
#note this can't be a good play. no Ds out, I forgot about the H hook though! and the L is unseen for FLEX, which will get him right back in the game. Still, I feel like we'll be equally likely to get the L since he'd have played it last turn if he had it.

#note WOW UGH TAKES A FRONT V HAHAHAHA
>Geoff_Thevenot: L C12 .L.. +28 295
>Matt_Canik: AAEJPSV H1 JAVAS +54 353
#note This was a really tricky turn, and I didn't know how to analyze it. JAVAS/SIRRAS wins pretty much any time Geoff can't bingo through the A. VAS/SIRRAS holds JA(VAS) to allow me to score next turn while giving geoff only a V to bingo with. VA(M)P wins Q's champ player, but I don't know what that really means. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?BEINNU -  +0 295
#note Geoff said he was 95% sure that SIRRAS was good but thought he couldn't win after this. I got REALLY lucky my blunder didn't cost me here. Geoff was in time trouble and is rusty. He won't miss INURB(A)NE at nationals.
