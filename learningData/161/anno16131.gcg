#note Whoa WRANG is a bad miss...
>John_Dalton: ?INORTU H8 .RUpTION +74 74
#note TRUNNION is a cool word I didn't know that plays 2x2
>Matt_Canik: ?DEMORT J8 sTORMED +75 99
#note pROM(p)TED 2x2 86, D(O)OMsTER 82. Damn.

>Matt_Canik: IIOPTTU E2 TUITIO. +14 149
#note Missed PUTTI(E), but I wonder if this is a decent enough play against John since he's such a slow player... an open board = more options = more thinking = he's going to go further over time?

TOIT L9 is also strong. 
>John_Dalton: GILZ 2B GLI.Z +70 212
#note Shit
>Matt_Canik: AAEEEOP D4 PEA +22 171
#note Wait, I'm going to end up winning this game by 160 without ever bingoing? (spoiler, sorry)

OPE for 31 is better here.

>Matt_Canik: ADEEGKO 1A KAE +26 197
#note Yuch GEODE for 38... I was trying to keep -ODE for a play there but I missed the fact that I could already play there!
>John_Dalton: FO 3B OF +26 260
>Matt_Canik: BDEGLMO L9 LOBED +41 238
#note Wasn't sure enough about GLOBED to play it. John also has less than 2 minutes now, so I know his score will be a lot lower than it looks right now. 
>John_Dalton: FN 6C N..F +15 275
>Matt_Canik: GIMOORY G2 YOGI +28 266
#note Aaaand now he's over time. I don't think I need to risk GLOBED again- I just need to score points and outrun him. (GLOBED is valid)

>John_Dalton: I 9L .I +3 287
>Matt_Canik: ABMORVY 8M MOB +25 322
#note I think it's a wiser decision to try and block his spot the best I can and hold ARY for the D11 spot.

#note Totally leaving that C in CAVY open to get him to burn more time looking for a third bingo in RUSTICAL/CURTAILS (there isn't one). He's about 5 minutes over now.
