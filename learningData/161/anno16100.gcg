#note Oops, missed VIRGA in the same spot. This was scored as 41, yikes.
>Martin: EFOV N4 FOVE. +19 52
>dacrON: ?EGLNYY M2 GLEY +26 136
#note I didn't notice what I'd done until later in the game. Against a lower rated opponent, such as Martin, I think this is a calculated risk worth taking; that said, I didn't notice it for quite a few turns (A(GLEY)).

#note seemed like a good idea.

#note Still haven't noticed A(GLEY) yet. DAGO is obviously best.
>Martin: N 10M .N +4 158
>dacrON: ADDIOTU O10 OUTADD +30 377
#note OUTDID is 8 trillion times better here, but I still haven't seen the A hook. OUTDID is just better anyway.
>Martin: ADEINRS 6E RANDIES +77 235
>dacrON: AEEIISW E4 WI.E +14 391
#note I put IWIS down, then realize A(GLEY) finally, then don't even play WAES for some inexplicable reason involving bingoing again on drawing the J or Z. Some sort of misreasoned greediness.
