#note Not really sure about this play either. I think YAWPS might be a bit better. YAWPER still leaves the T open and hard to close, while YAWPS closes ES.

#note I think the other option is RUM C1. I don't think I can do ROW C1. Can I afford to start

#note This is a really odd play. VERB seems like it would be bad, keeping STTV. But I think it actually makes sense. STTV scores well most of the time next turn. Plays like VERVET/VERVE/VERB/VAST are super risky because he's probably buidling up to a bingo. Exchanging keeping EST doesn't seem worth sacrificing 18 points at all.

>Noah: CNOSTTV 14A COV.T +20 272
#note Maybe VAST because the C is pretty strong to score through, and I score more points. I was worried about TAURINES plays but really the C is worse.

#note Really, really bad play. DOCS has to be correct here. I only thought of TICS which may still be better.
>Matthew_Steele: ?AEFMRS A12 FA.E +39 335
>Noah: AFGIINN M1 FAIN +30 360
#note Should've played FANG. Matthew is down to 10 seconds here and he could go over and not see RaMS. Then I would win. Gotta give your opponent chances to screw up! This scored "thirty" in the game because he went overtime.
