#note A spiffy Q setup too, if he doesn't play there. (Wish I had Elise so I could look at heat maps, I wonder how often he plays there)
>Paul_Holser: HKLOS 14J KOHLS +67 134
#note He spent forever here, which makes me highly suspicious that he had a blank. 
>Matt_Canik: ?DDLOQV -DOQV +0 64
#note Q prefers LOV(E)D here by several points. I am SO bad with the Q. 
>Paul_Holser: WY 14F Y.W +22 156
>Matt_Canik: ?DLNRUV N11 LUV. +7 71
#note This is like the worst game ever. He's about to bingo and I just exchanged then played LUV(S) for 7. Q says V(I)RL for 8 is slightly better. Yay scoring 8 points instead of 7 after an exchange!
>Paul_Holser: ?CEENPU 11A PEdUNC.E +72 228
#note OPULENCE/PULICENE are 2x2s for 94. 
>Matt_Canik: ?ADFNRS 10B FAN +30 101
#note On one hand, I feel like I should leave the 3x3 open. On the other hand, with a lead this big, he never actually lets me have it. I figured I'd just run with the equity here.

#note Just sort of given in at this point... GIG(HE) is a nice option to give me a fighting chance, though
>Paul_Holser: ARWY 3I W.ARY +30 319
#note Could you stop having perfect blocking plays that still score 30+ points, paul?
