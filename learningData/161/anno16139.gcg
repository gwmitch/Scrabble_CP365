>JD: AEEINPT 9K PIE +15 44
#note I thought I was smart by blocking the lanes on the right, but really I'm just sacrificing a point and blocking my own spots to bingo and giving him free points if he has B or G.

#note this looks like my best chance that doesn't involve witchens
>Olaugh: ?ADIJLY L1 JAILs +50 406
#note john has quite a few wins. I found his best sequence - DAILY sets up JIbB at A1. he also saw after the game that he can play JILBAb and win by 1 point. also he scored this as 48.
