#note 2nd worst beat in my short tourney career.  Was low on time...and tracked 95% of the game...and assumed he could do nothing with 2 u's.  Definitely learning the hard way...but learning.  
>Roger:  (LONST) +10 431
#note 4 letter overlap, through a g and two u's!  He put down augur first and then realized he had a bingo.  Still shocking.  Controlled most of the game to had it go down the drain.
