#note DITZ and ZING don't let me bingo all that often and block the 2x2.

>Matt_Canik: ?ADNNST F7 p.NDANTS +64 77
#note I saw STANDDOWN and DOWNSTAND* and couldn't decide which to play, so I played this. Damnit STANDDOWN is good.

#note Steve is a defensive player. He HATES things like this and I figure he will, in the immeidiate future, play along 14H for almost nothing to try to block the spot.

>Matt_Canik: DDEILRR 6A LED.R +19 304
#note This was one of the more difficult turns I've had recently. Apparently I messed up for two reasons: 1. this play sucks.  and 2. I also managed to phoney Steve for the 4th time in 5 games with LEDER*.
>Steve_Glass: AEG 14H GAE +13 316
>Matt_Canik: ?DGIIRV C11 VIG.R +18 322
#note NO IDEA what to do here. RIDGI(L) is a good option I didn't notice, but it holds that clunky V. What should I do? Fish? Score? 
>Steve_Glass: AQT M3 QAT +30 346
>Matt_Canik: ?DIOUUV 15G VOID +42 364
#note As unsexy as it is to go into an endgame with UU, I think I have to here...
>Steve_Glass: EEFIRRS 4C R.REFIES +62 408
#note are you fucking kidding me?
>Matt_Canik: ?MSTUUY 6I hYM.S +51 415
#note I saw the sequence of MUTUa(L)/Y(E)S and calculated that it was slightly better, but this play is so sexy so I made it.
