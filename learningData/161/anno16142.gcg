>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIOPY H11 APO +10 78
#note Whatever the right play is here, it surely can't be this. I guess I felt the need to semi-block such an easy bingo line. I didn't find OPI(ATE) which is winning the sim. AYE instead of APO sims better too. I literally played APO instead to keep my E.
>Noella_Ward: DEIW H11 ...DE +24 55
>Noella_Ward: DEIW --  -24 31
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFIOY G12 OY +22 100
#note Nothing good here really, this sims best but my rack isn't going places.

>Noella_Ward: DEIW 13G ..WIE +15 46
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEFIRU 12J AFIRE +23 123
#note Going for defense instead of playing FEUAR.
>Noella_Ward: DITZ 14K DITZ +35 81
>Matthew_Larocque: AADINTU F8 AUDIT +15 138
#note Geez these racks are bad. Of course, so is the board....if you don't have an S.
>Noella_Ward: BEN E9 NEB +23 104
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIINUU H6 UN.I +6 144
#note Okay, this was ridiculous. I can't believe I didn't exchange here. I can't believe I wasted time on my clock thinking about anything here. A repulsive play, no doubt. 
>Noella_Ward: ?GMNNOR D3 MORNiNG +74 178
#note The beginning of the end.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDEIOU 3B DU.BIE +24 168
#note Haha, not even a word. Neither is DUMBY or DUMMIE, just DUMMY or DUMBO. I forgot that DAUB takes an E.... A(M)EBOID scores 30 points too.
>Noella_Ward: Q F2 Q. +31 209
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGNORX 15N AX +38 206
>Noella_Ward: ELLSW 15G WELLS +32 241
#note Could have been worse.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACGNOOR 6B CO.GO +16 222
#note Was going to play COO(N) but like the ARN leave, plus CO(N)GO makes it hard for her to shut down that part of the board.
>Noella_Ward: OV N10 VO. +14 255
>Matthew_Larocque: AHHNNRU I3 HUNH +19 241
#note I've managed my time even worse than usual this game. H is usually a good scoring letter to keep, but the board is pure crap so turnover for the blank seems like the only thing worth doing here.
>Noella_Ward: GRT 4G TR.G +8 263
#note Scored as 7.
>Matthew_Larocque: AFNPRSS J2 FA. +20 261
#note Must have missed (H)ARPS here.
>Noella_Ward: STY K4 STY +18 281
>Matthew_Larocque: NOPRRSS 8A POR. +18 279
#note Whiffed S-hooking MORNiNG, that's too bad. Also didn't see (F)RONS.
>Noella_Ward: AM 9A AM +12 293
#note According to my scoresheet, I neglected to write this play down. I also have her exchanging 3 letters at this point in the game, but that doesn't work (and there wasn't enough left in the bag anyways). No idea what happened there.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEENRSS 2J .ENDS +18 297
#note Missed ES(TOP) and (R)E(T)S. I also debated just (F)END but cmon she must have the blank.
>Noella_Ward: ?EEELRT 1M EEL +14 307
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIRS F14 IS +13 310
#note Still ES(TOP) and (R)E(T)S.
>Noella_Ward: ?ERT A8 ..RTEd +8 315
>Noella_Ward:  (EIR) +6 321
#note -30 for me. The UN(C)I turn was so bad, it's not a stretch to say it could have cost me.
