#note TAK(E)R is the other option. Or TAKER/EWER, I guess.

>Noah: FIINPQU H1 QUINI. +48 198
#note Didn't seem like QUOIN was worth it.
>Nigel: AEINSTW 13A WANIEST +79 175
>Noah: EFGLPRV 2F FR.G +16 214
#note I thought about GULF also, but didn't want him to open off row 1 there as much. FIVER giving up so much scoring didn't seem right. PERV/PELF I thought were more likely to lead to a loss.
>Nigel: EHX 12B HEX +51 226
>Noah: AEJLLPV D2 JELL. +24 238
#note I just figured this gave up less equity than JAPES/JAPE. Quackle agrees.
>Nigel: IZ A13 .IZ +45 271
>Noah: AABINPV 3A PAV. +18 256
#note Again sacrificing a lot over PAVIN.
>Nigel: COS A1 CO.S +27 298
>Noah: ?ABDINN 15A .IN +12 268
#note It seems like HAD is the other option. I thought it was better just to take this away entirely.
