#note A few more points for hooking ZOAEA, but I had slivers of doubt about what it took (both E and S), so I just did this, trying to play as I would in a real game, particularly without double challenge.

#note So this is the position I wanted to talk about, just because this sort of thing comes up a lot - how do you evaluate whether to be more concerned about your opponent hitting a bingo, or catching up with scoring plays late in the game? I can either play here or on the bottom triple for essentially the same score. The bottom triple is easier for Quackle to hit and score well on, whereas playing where I did blocks two good lanes. Also, a case could be made for N6 QUAG (though I don't think that's right). So how do you make the decision? Does it need to be heavily dependent on looking for possible bingos in the pool and determining probabilities? Can you look at the game score and a range of possible bingo scores and make some assessment of whether you could stay in control of the game after a bingo? If so, how is this done? I would greatly appreciate if experts who know how to approach these questions could at least point me in the direction of how to do it. Of course, feel free to comment on any other turns, too.

#note Naturally, the bingo comes through my bingo-defense play. Reminiscent of Wiegand's BROWALLIA.
