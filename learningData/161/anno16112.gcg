#note I doubted LUNET. But even if I were sure it were good, I don't know if I'd have played it. I'm down by 37 right now. I'm opening up 13I as a really easy-to-score spot and scoring 28 (23 in my eyes with LUNE instead), and I'm very likely to get outrun, especially with the high-scorers HPPVW unseen. Maybe it's premature to be thinking this way, but it seemed to me like my best chance to win this game was to open a sneaky bingo line and hit it. Hence TURN, putting the R and N in the bingo lines to maximize my chances of hitting it.
