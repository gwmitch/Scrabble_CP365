#note Q likes DOZY a bit more. COPAY N1 is also an option.

>Matt_Canik: ABDIINP 4I ABIDIN. +22 259
#note This was a really tough turn. I don't know if I should be trying to kill things off after COO or what. I considered BINDI 2F 29 and API(A)N F5 30, as well as BID 8K. What's defensive and what's just paranoid? Does this make any sense for messing up the long-term openness of the board? I'm now one row 8 play away from shutting everything down.

>Matt_Canik: AEEFILP N6 PEA. +27 286
#note Still confused about what to do in terms of closing. He's just played 5 so I think his bingo odds are quite low (he probably held something like vowel + S), so should I just grab the equity?
>DDDDD: ELX 3K LEX +44 253
>Matt_Canik: EEFILLV 7J ELEV.. +13 299
#note Now it's really hard for him to bingo!
>DDDDD: VW F7 V.W +9 262
#note And now it's even harder!
>Matt_Canik: FIJKLQR 11B J..K +30 329
#note Drawing JQK is about the best thing that can happen now- on a close board, I can keep scoring points and I've got to shut it down if he tries to open. 
>DDDDD: AI 3J A...I. +20 282
#note Nice!
>Matt_Canik: FGILQRR 10K GIRL +23 352
#note This is weak to -EST or -ATE or a few ridiculous overlaps. Should I just exchange instead, or take the risk that he doesn't have a bingo?
>DDDDD: ENOS 11K ONES +30 312
>Matt_Canik: EEFNQRT 12I RENT +21 373
#note FRET 6G is really cool, but I have to close this stuff I think. 
>DDDDD: DHOS F11 SHOD +28 340
>Matt_Canik: EFIOQSU 15F SUQ +45 418
>Matt_Canik: EFIOQSU --  -45 373
#note I was fairly certain SHOD took an S, but not 100%. I don't make this play if I'm not certain I can win anyway. 
>DDDDD: FU 7B FU. +12 352
#note I guess he had a crazy fish in mind?
>Matt_Canik: EFIOQSU G13 FOE +22 395
#note I hold SUQ/TINTS or QU(IN), and both of those otherwise give up big points to Darrell. I'm not playing them yet and making him hold his I. 
>DDDDD: AINNTUW 14A WAT +19 371
>Matt_Canik: IQSU 13L SUQ +29 424
#note With (E)NNUI as a threatening out, I have to play it now.
