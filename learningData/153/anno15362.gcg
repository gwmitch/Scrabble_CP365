#note Whoa, AMN is better than EMN, even as a bingo leave. AEMN is the best leave of all, statically and on a sim. I think I keep too many more CCV leaves than CCVV leaves.

#note I didn't think of YEH here for some reason. Sim details show opponent scoring about the same next turn after each play. That seems odd to me. Are row 4 plays just not that good? I guess that must be it. YEH sims better because it scores more and because the next turns scores are similar enough for both plays. Okay, sure. I'm inclined to agree with the sim on this type of play.

#note I thought for a while about this then challenged, because I wasn't sure of it as a word, probably a little less than 50% sure, and if it gets challenged off Shannon has crap.

>Noah: INOPRST 9I TROPINS +65 232
#note There are three bingos available here: FROSTNIP, TROPINS and ATROPINS. Whatever I play puts me down a turn which I need to make up before the game ends. I don't see a reason to play ATROPINS. It doesn't really do anything to the board that would make it better than the slightly higher scoring bingos. Not sure about the other two though. Besides the J, the column A scoring spot after FROSTNIP seems as dangerous as the row 1 scoring spot after TROPINS. In fact setting up the J is more of a boon because if I am down and that's the sort of advantage I want to put me in command of the game. Both plays keep a reasonable amount of good bingo lanes open. In terms of short-term equity, then, the plays look similar. It looks like it's harder to block bingos long term post-FROSTNIP, as there are bingo lanes in several places, though FROSTNIP also makes it harder to open the top of the board by weakening columns B and C for mid-range scoring plays. I'm not sure which play I prefer -- they look really close.

#note Would anyone play QUIP here? I thought about it, and it seems like an interesting idea. At this score though, sacrificing the points didn't seem worth it. If I was down a bit more I might prefer QUIP.

#note DOTAL is another option. This seems to make sense because after DOTAL he can usually close the bottom of the board (and thus most of my chances) efficiently.
