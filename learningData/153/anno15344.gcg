#note kerb seems worth it
>JD: DEMNOWY 4J YOM +31 311
#note blocks some lanes, leaves good points for next turn. weedy, quackle's choice, doesn't seem to do as good of a job of taking out lanes.
>Kolton_Koehler: ?AEHKNT 12H .ETHANKs +82 333
>JD: DENOTWZ O7 DOZEN. +45 356
#note I liked the w-k-- setup that playing dozens created. quackle does think I might be able to outrun with WED at 6J though (he's quite likely to hit that spot if I don't this turn)
>Kolton_Koehler: AAADIPU 6J PAD +35 368
#note he's in a lot of trouble, but PIKA keeping a consonant may give him a better chance.
>JD: EEISTWY N10 YI.ES +55 411
#note seems that I should be safe after this play as long as I don't get Q or J stuck, but even if I do draw the Q I have a great shot at an A to give me places to dump QAT. If I can't draw an A it's going to be a tough endgame.
>Kolton_Koehler: AAILOPU 10H .OUP +8 376
#note PULA holds him to a 15 point loss since I eat the J.
