#note Missed SIXMO, which I like best. I played this to keep an open board for my bingo leave and not open as much to score with, as opposed to something like OX 9E or OXIMS D4.
>Jerry: AFFT D8 .TAFF +22 88
>Noah: DEMOOSV F7 V.MOOSED +70 92
#note Which VAMOOSED is better? I chose this because it seemed like it offered worse scoring opportunities for next turn. I guess my judgment was correct, as this is valuated a couple points higher on simulation. On the other hand, I do prefer an open board, especially against Jerry, and the other VAMOOSED seems better to get me that. I probably should've played the other. I played this very quickly because I didn't feel like I should waste time on an insignificant decision. But this is a significant decision, as the board configurations after the different VAMOOSED plays are very different. It wouldn't be hard to decide which was better.

#note Nice!

#note Between this and RAW, my intuition went with this. Quackle backs it up in a two-ply sim.

>Noah: AAHIILT 3G HA.I +18 153
#note I wasn't a big fan of this play but didn't see much else that looked good. There's a cool option here though: IXIA B6. IXIA keeps a better leave than this, and opens an annoying bingo lane for Jerry to worry about. The A1 scoring spot seems annoying, but simulation shows that it's not even close to as dangerous as 2J. The one think I like about HAJI is that it makes a more friendly board to work with. But then again, that one A line is all I need, because it's just hard to deal with outside of his own bingo.

#note I didn't want to play BIB 4K and keep such a bad leave for this board, but now that I've thought more about the position I see that this has to be a mistake. Blocking row 4 is very important, as it's not only Jerry's main scoring spot, it also gives an easy way to block the (LINAC)S hook. Row 4 plays both are very common and make this game much harder to win. I'm lucky he didn't have one.

#note Jerry's actual rack here.
>Noah: AEIPQSU L12 QUAI +34 299
#note I thought about PIQUE, but determined that PIQUET scores would often be too devastating to overcome, plus this keeps the other S hook open. Really PIQUE's only advantage is the points but his responses mostly make them irrelevant.
>Jerry: ORTT 13I TRO.T +20 382
>Noah: AENPPST K1 P. +4 303
#note I thought about a few choices here: Fish T, fish P, fish A and PETNAPS. PETNAPS never won so I wasn't going to play that. Fish T won with only the R and TROUT implies Jerry didn't have the I, so I wanted a rack that hit the I. This hit other bingos like PENATES besides the winning SAPIENT, so I played it. Missed PE H7 but this somehow sims better, not sure why.
