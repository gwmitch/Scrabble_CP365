#note I was really, really kicking myself over this play after the fact. I saw EXAMPLED immediately after, no idea why I missed it. likely cost me the game as the tiles lie, as well as any chance I had at top 5.

#note kombu is obvious. OM at 15H is kind of interesting too...what bingoes am I supposedly hitting? steaming after missing EXAMPLED, which is why you shouldn't get angry at yourself for making mistakes! given his next play I'm in trouble no matter what, but still, gotta keep playing optimally

#note I was furious about exampled and thus went for the gratuitous stylish play instead of just playing TIKI. He's always going to block but at least I force the play out of him. My play might work if I draw the Y, but not otherwise. On further reflection though this may actually be the best play since I'm not sure if TIKI gives me any chance of winning. my odds are small no matter what.
