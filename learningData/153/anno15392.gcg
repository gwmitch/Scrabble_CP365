#note #1 play. unless you consider the slightly better option of tossing all my tiles up in the air so i can distract my opponent and grab the blanks from the bag.
>ladder_diva: BIOR 9E BIRO +23 23
>freak_by_ovens: BHLNOPT 7G PHON +31 59
#note hey! i'm two for two! stop the game now before i make a suboptimal play!
>ladder_diva: EEIKV K5 KIEVE +34 57
#note believe david said he chickened out on KEAVIE#. he also first laid down KIEV# before deciding to tack on the extra letter. will it come into play later in the game? stay tuned to find out...
>freak_by_ovens: BLNNPTT -BLNNPT +0 59
#note duh. the duck initially says to play 9j B(E)NT and then kicks itself in the head when it realizes how stupid that would be.
>ladder_diva: AACHY L1 CHAYA +38 95
#note sensed a little hesitation as he begrudgingly laid this down. can't understand why.
>freak_by_ovens: ?ADENST 1H ENDo.AST +140 199
#note oh yeah. that's why. time to relax, right?
>ladder_diva: EIILP 2F PILEI +24 119
>freak_by_ovens: AAELOOT M3 TOEA +24 223
#note not bad, but 8k VOLAE# tops the list. yup, makes sense.
>ladder_diva: FFNORU 3C RUNOFF +51 170
#note ruh roh. time to start worrying.
>freak_by_ovens: AEELORV 8K .ALVE +36 259
#note VOLVE# is a word. heck, so is VOLVA. fine, no worries.
>ladder_diva: EIW N6 WI.E +31 201
>freak_by_ovens: AEINORT 10A OTARINE +85 344
#note what's the worst that could happen here?
>ladder_diva: ?GILNNO A8 GL.NOINs +131 332
#note yikes. don't hit the panic button yet.
>freak_by_ovens: AIOSSWY J9 YWIS +23 367
#note more collins misses. b10 TOWSY# is way preferable...
>ladder_diva: ADILMRU 12A .RDALIUM +78 410
#note ...and doesn't allow him to play this.
>freak_by_ovens: AABOSUZ 9A .UZ +45 412
#note not dead yet! yeehaw!
>ladder_diva: EGRX 2A GREX +35 445
#note grrr. stop scoring, kid.
>freak_by_ovens: AABEOST 13C OBA +22 434
#note with four in the bag, i noticed i held four of the six remaining vowels. opted for OBA as it scores 22, keeps an awesome leave, and creates a lane for a 7LW - which didn't exist beforehand.
>ladder_diva: CDEGSTT O7 D.TECTS +16 461
#note he's obviously aware of my vowel bounty based on OBA. so with one in the bag, he can't really shed the E without either scoring decently or using up enough tiles to have at least one outplay...but that doesn't really matter here. he basically has to hope i don't hold AEJMRST or anything from the AEEMRST family. and even if he attempts to block it, my comeback will undoubtedly score more and odds on, he won't be able to play out.
>freak_by_ovens: AEJMRST 14C RAMJETS +96 530
>freak_by_ovens:  (challenge) +5 535
#note yup, that happened. and in this situation, the challenge for the additional five is required. you know, just in case.
>freak_by_ovens:  (EG) +6 541
#note in my 16+ years of playing 'professionally', i have never had a game quite like this. the dueling nine-timers, the excited highs, the stomach-churning lows, the crazy ending. that's scrabble, folks.
