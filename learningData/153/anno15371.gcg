>Michael: ?EEIILS 6B IdE.LISE +60 88
>Reid: AGIOSXY D12 OXY +30 120
#note OXY (60.33%) is #5. AX (62.87%) at 7H, XI (61.02%) at 7I, and YOGIS (60.51%) at 12A are the top 3. I considered XI, but wanted both the X and Y out of my rack. In hindsight, giving Michael access to the X was not a great move, but I was able to bingo the next turn.

#note SAVANT (71.39%) is #2. PAVANE (72.32%) is #1 at D1. ATAPS (70.04%) at O1 is #3. I had considered PAVANE, but decided to knock out some of the triples before I created more.

>Michael: DEOP C1 DOPE +26 402
>Reid: CEILOOU A3 COO +22 412
#note LIEU at N8 and UNCOIL at 12I are both winners. NUCLEI (50.00%) at 12J is #3. COO is a loser at #6. I had planned on having LIEU as my out and was crossing my fingers it wouldn't be blocked. I had the right idea but the wrong order.
>Michael: ABOTT N10 AB +10 412
#note AB for the block is the best play here.
>Reid: EILU 14B L.. +16 428
#note LAY is #5 based on valuations from 5-min championship player. EL at F12 and VINEAL and VENIAL at L1 are the top 3.

#note #1 play here.
>Michael:  (EIU) +6 438
#note This game was officially scored as 436-425. UTTERING was scored incorrectly as 70. AMNIC was scored incorrectly as 42. No missed bingos. 8 of 11 plays were in the top 5. 7 of 11 plays were in the top 2 choices. A poorly executed endgame loses the game. Overall, I give myself a B- for this game.
