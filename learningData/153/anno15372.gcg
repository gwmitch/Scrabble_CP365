#note I didn't like this word, and it sounded like Darrell knew words pretty well, as when Alan Stern asked how many people studied four hours a day in the last year, he was one of the people who raised his hand, so he would probably challenge if this wasn't good. It isn't worth giving up a likely turn to play this over bEAUTIFY. So why did I play it?

#note Wanted to block the most dangerous lane on the board and turn over an extra tile for the blank and score a bit more, hence none of the BOONS. I probably should've considered that the extra tile also gets me close to Js and Qs, though. Sure, this board is friendly to the Q and the J isn't bad either, but I at least should've thought about that as a potential downside.

#note Darrell told me his rack. He was mad because he thought I blocked the least dangerous lane on the board and his bingo just so happened to fit there. I told him why he was wrong.
