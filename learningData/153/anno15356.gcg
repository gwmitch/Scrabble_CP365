#note I can see obelism or midsole being a point better
>Robin: AGGIIRT D8 .IG +6 6
#note might be better to dump the other G as well with no N in sight

#note 2200-rated drawing

#note plt is more useful than bit, which I should've realized.
>JD: BEILPTX 13C PLEX +37 180
#note seems like ibex leaves me a more useful set of letters (PLT). also quackle wants me to play at K4, which I do not like.
>Robin: ACDEERV 14B REAVED +48 126
#note nice

#note sacrificing way too many points for pseudo-defense, the board is just as open to bingoes regardless of this play. I didn't want to play CURIE at K2, but CUTIE there or JUICE both sim better. JUICE gives her one turn to hit a 7 but seems to allow me to control the board better next turn.

#note quackle prefers AW at 15C slightly but I should respect the setup.

>JD: AEGIKOT 15A KEG +32 266
#note finally drew the case G for this potentially dangerous lane. Quackle likes a temporizing move like KETO at F2 but I'd rather not create more lanes for her to work with long-term.

#note maybe louma? the G could be a desperation lane
>JD: AINOPWY N10 YAWP +44 373
#note noway is a little better, yawp also allows for some high-scoring fishes for her potentially
