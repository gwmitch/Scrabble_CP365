#note saw CUNDY# but couldn't decide: a) whether it was acceptable or; b) whether i wanted to keep a W.

>freak_by_ovens: ACEIOTU 8A CUTIE +28 50
#note guess COUTA# is slightly better. hey, i'm not a master of CSW-only 5s. yet. EUOI# 9h is an interesting play but no way i'm forgoing 11 points this early.

#note with everything that's on the line in this game, this definitely made me feel more at ease. now to draw one of those blanks...
>get_off_the_oven: AIJO 6B JIAO +32 83
>freak_by_ovens: AEIMUUW -AIMUUW +0 132
#note no freakin' way i'm playing WAU(L) i1. EAU 9j looks intriguing, especially the M setup. but there are other available hooks and the UW combo negate that thought.
>get_off_the_oven: DIS H1 DIS. +15 98
#note hmm. well, at least i know one of his remaining tiles.
>freak_by_ovens: AEEEFOS 9F FEE +20 152
#note ALOE i3 is so much better. even OE/EE 9i is an improvement.
>get_off_the_oven: DDEEERS A7 S.REEDED +64 162
#note stop making me nervous. i was close to adding on a nickel but was pretty sure i'd seen it somewhere before.
>freak_by_ovens: AEHOQST 5J .OH +29 181
#note keeping the A for a potential QAT, which fits in one spot for negligible points. excitement.
>get_off_the_oven: CINOV 3B COVIN +24 186
>freak_by_ovens: AAEIQST 1F QA.I +14 195
#note QASIDA is a word?!? man, i quit this game. no, wait, my play is still best. suck it, lexicon.
>get_off_the_oven: ITZ 12A .ITZ +28 214
>freak_by_ovens: AEISSTU 9J SAU +19 214
#note took a while on this one. really hated cutting off multiple S lanes. perhaps EAU/S 13c?
>get_off_the_oven: BORTU L8 R.BOUT +18 232
>freak_by_ovens: EGHISTU 14G HUGIEST +72 286
#note congrats to HUGY# for being the only CSW adjective that *doesn't* compare. (before i receive hate mail, i'm aware there are at least two of three others that share the same characteristic.)
>get_off_the_oven: EFGL 15E FLEG +38 270
#note looks good, although i believe geoff said he missed GAREF(O)WL#.
>freak_by_ovens: AAEENPY 10E AYE +37 323
#note clean up the mess, score well, knock out most of row 11, and maybe - just maybe - pick up one of those blanks.
>get_off_the_oven: GW 11K W.G +14 284
#note oh, boy. really likely he's holding one blank. almost sure he's got both...
>freak_by_ovens: AENPRRT 13G TRAP +27 350
#note TRINE b10 adds another point but i'm now in the business to cut down bingo opportunities. make it as difficult as possible for him to score big.
>get_off_the_oven: A D12 .A +11 295
#note bet he had something playable but wisely chose to leave one in the bag and let me make a mistake...
>freak_by_ovens: EMMNNOR -  +0 350
#note ...unless i make one first. passing may be a game-losing decision. c'mon, i'm up 55. so i can score 32 for MIMEO/MIMER b11 and there's no way he'll be able to score more than low 70s. with whatever he gets off my rack, it won't be enough. why give him the chance to fish and create an unblockable situation where i could lose even with MIMEO/MIMER? stupid, stupid, stupid.
>get_off_the_oven: ??ABELO N5 OBLAtEs +72 367
#note (scored as 70) geoff took a few minutes here but fortunately didn't opt for the fish of (R)E. so if he did that and i do MIMEO/MIMER (for an 85-point lead), then...oh, i still win. he has to use a blank as the 7th letter down the N column with the B on the TLS and that only scores 78. and along with the six from me, then i'd win by ONE. oy. i hate thinking.
>freak_by_ovens: EMMNNOR O8 MOM +38 388
#note yep, that'll do it. exhale.
>get_off_the_oven: R L3 R.. +6 373
#note geoff. gentleman, as always.
>get_off_the_oven:  (ENNR) +8 381
#note final recorded score: 388-379.
