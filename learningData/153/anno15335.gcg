#note counter-intuitive to me that cozier is better since it puts more nice letters out there for mack to work with, but croze gives up a lot of cheap points. poxy at I7 is interesting but a bad idea, I think.

#note another huge error, GILNOT has great fishing potential on this board - I can hit a lot of bingoes in spots that are quite hard for mack to block, like LENTIGO or SOLATING/SLOTTING/STOOLING. I have a 52% shot at bingoing as opposed to 10%. this is leaving a ton of win percentage on the table.

#note quite proud of this play, quackle can't come up with it but it wins 2/8 because I draw an unblockable out if I draw the L. Mack later told me he drew the blank when he played JUT, so I guess I had a shot. this play also blocks plays like WEAVE, VASELINE and VALUE to preserve spread.

#note best is SEA at 14L to set up VILE (which isn't worth me blocking) but this is enough
