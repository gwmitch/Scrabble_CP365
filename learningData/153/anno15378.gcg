>Cris: LOOT 8G TOOL +8 8
>Reid: CHIMNOR H4 HORM.NIC +69 69
#note My play is #2 (67.62%). HORMONIC at 17 (68.91%) is #1 and at H7 (67.13%) its #3. 
>Cris: AU -  +0 8
#note Amazingly, Cris challenges the bingo. I was pretty confident when I played it, but his challenge made me wonder how the hell the word got in my head if it was invalid.
>Reid: ?EEGVVX I3 VEX +31 100
#note #1 play.
>Cris: AU 3I .AU +6 14
#note Cris seems unfazed by the slow start and sticks with his normal balancing strategy.
>Reid: ?EGINRV K5 VERsING +94 194
#note #1 play. INVEIGHER at 4B is #2.
>Cris: AN 2J AN +10 24
>Reid: CDEEEIT 5E DET.. +26 220
#note DETOX (98.93%) is #2. DEICE (98.96%) is #1 at 11E and DEICER (98.90%) at 6C is #3. The leave is risky here, but I wanted to keep up the scoring pace.
>Cris: AEINPST E5 .EPAINTS +72 96
>Reid: CEEILNR 8A ERIC. +30 250
#note Cris' bingo knocks out my DECLINER. My play is #1.
>Cris: DEOW D12 OWED +24 120
>Reid: EFILNRU 15A FUN.I +27 277
#note FUNDI (98.96%) is #3. DIREFUL (99.31%) is #1  at 15D and FUNDER (99%) is #2.
>Cris: ADEORST C2 ASTERO.D +74 194
>Reid: EEKLLRR 2B L.RK +16 293
#note LARK (93.76%) is #10. LARKER (95.57%) is #1, LAKER (95.35%) is #2, and LEAKER (95.07%) is #3 at 2A. The top 2 choices have good leaves, but I preferred my choice because of defensive considerations.
>Cris: MY F1 MY +35 229
>Reid: ABBEELR C12 BAR. +29 322
#note BARN (92.90%) is #8. BELLE (94.88%) and BELL at J6 are #1 and #2. AMBER (93.29%) at 7G is #3. I still like my play here.
>Cris: EJU 4A JU.E +38 267
>Reid: ABEELYZ 1F .AZY +54 376
#note #1 play.
>Cris: AQT B11 QAT +24 291
>Reid: BEEGLPS 1K GLEBE +31 407
#note Since the board is essentially closed, I decided to gamble and use both of my E to keep up the scoring pace and hopefully pull the last blank with tile turnover and ensure the win. While I've opened the board, I'm hoping I can still keep a 1 bingo buffer between us. GLEBE (99.11%) is #3. BELLE (99.55%) and BELL (99.19%) at J6 are the top 2. I agree with Quackle here. BELLE scores as much as GLEBE w/o opening the board. It's not a huge difference, but with Cris you need to be careful, especially with a blank still out.
>Cris: F F5 .F +26 317
>Reid: DEGOPSU J6 PO. +23 430
#note POL (97.25%) is #7. ANODE (98.27%) at 2J is #1 with good scoring and great defense. GNU (98%) at 10J is #2, and UPO (97.83%) at B4 is #3. I agree with Quackle here.
>Cris: OW N1 .OW +16 333
#note Cris is balancing and opening up the triple bingo lane. The bingo is still out, so this is dangerous. While the game is likely unwinnable, I want to preserve my spread now.
>Reid: ADEGSSU 4L AGS +17 447
#note AGS (99.93%) is #11. The top 10 plays are all winners according to Quackle. AGUE at J11 and M3 and EGADS at M1 are the top 3. I disagree with Quackle here. I think AGS blocks nicely and only opens slightly in the M lane. The 4 I outstanding could make a bingo tough. I'm not so much worried about the win as maintaining the spread.
>Cris: I E2 .I +6 339
#note Cris likely had an I problem too.
>Reid: DEILNSU F9 DUI +15 462
#note NU at 10K, POLL at J6, and NU at 10E are the top 3 choices. All 15 top plays are winners. Again, I know I will win, I just don't want Cris to get a last bingo. While my rack is close to bingo prone, and NU would have a great leave, Cris might still bingo. I disagree with Quackle here. DUI is #6 based on valuations of all choices.
>Cris: ?AEHIOT M3 A.IO +20 359
#note  There is no bingo for Cris to play. EOLITH at L10 is the best play.
>Reid: EELNS 7J ..ES +12 474
#note ORES is #4. LINS and LIES at 9J are the top 2 and EELS at N6 is #3. I wanted to block Cris' H.
>Cris: ?HIT 12K sHIT +22 381
>Cris: ?HIT --  -22 359
>Reid: ELN 11K .LEN +5 479
#note GLEN is #2. LINE and LIEN are #1.
>Reid:  (HIT?) +12 491
#note No missed bingos. 13 of 15 plays in the top 10. 10/15 plays in the top 5. Overall, I give myself an A- this game.
