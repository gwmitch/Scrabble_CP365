>Emily: AELSTTT 8D TATTLES +66 66
>Reid: DHIINTY 7I YID +22 22
#note YID (23.97%) is #10. DISHY (27.87%) at J6 is #1; HID (25.36%) and HI (24.58%) at 9I are #2 and #3. I agree with Quackle here. The leave for DISHY is better and the triple letter is not exposed.
>Emily: ABW 6J WAB +33 99
>Reid: AEHINST 5G SHEITAN +89 111
#note #1 play. ABSINTHE (45.08%) is #2 at L5 and HESITANT (41.04%) at D1 is #3. I didn't see any other bingos except the anagram and ASTHENIA.

#note #1 play.
>Emily: IKLNSY O4 SLINKY +55 226
>Reid: DEMOTVZ 6D .DZ +33 192
#note ADZ (21.1%) is #3. MATZO (23.76%) at 6C is #1. ZEMSTVO (22.93%) at 11A is #3. I agree with Quackle here. The leave for MATZO is still good, it scores more, and opens the board. ZEMSTVO is not worth the defensive risk although it has the advantage of tile turnover. At this time, Emily has the last blank, so tile turnover would not be as important.

#note #1 play.

#note #1 play.
>Emily: EEGI F11 .IEGE +10 389
#note And the blocking phase begins.
>Reid: ACEEHRR M7 HER. +22 298
#note According to 5-min championship player, EF (1.85%) at 7C, RE (1.71%) at C3 and DEAIR (1.62%) at E6 are the top 3. Quackle is trying to create hooks for a potential bingo. HERN is #2 baed on valuations from all choices. I don't agree with Quackle here. I don't think my play is that bad.
>Emily: OO 1H .OO +10 399
#note Another block.
>Reid: ABCDEFR 15A DEFAC. +39 337
#note DEFACE (3.75%) is #2. FACE (5.2%) is #1 at C1. FACE (3.00%) at 13C is #3. I like my play here.
>Emily: AIN 14A ANI +18 417
#note Another block.
>Reid: BINOPRT L8 BO. +17 354
#note Quackle is still trying to win this game. I had pretty much given up at this point. BRO (14.33%) at C2 has a suprisingly higher than expected chance of winning. BRIO (11.47%) and BIRO (9.67%) at C1 are #2 and #3. I have to agree with Quackle here, I gave up too soon. BOA (7.4%) is #6.
>Emily: EIU 15H .IEU +4 421
#note A final block to seal it up almost completely.
>Reid: AEINPRT 13A PAR +31 385
#note According to 5-min chamiponship player, PART, TARP, and TARN at 13A are the top 3. PAR is #3 based on valuations from all choices. Playing PART or PART allows the beautiful out of SENTI at 5G. This reduces the spread by 10 points.
>Emily: CEMOOQU 4A QUO. +24 445
>Reid: EINT 14K NITE +10 395
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (CEMO) +16 411
#note No missed bingos. 10 of 12 plays in the top 10. 8 of 10 plays in the top 3. Emily just had the early momentum in this game. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game. My endgame was weak and I probably didn't try to open the board enough.
