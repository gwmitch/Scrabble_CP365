#note thanks to avery for supplying his racks. smart here to pass up the 12 extra points

>JD: AAENRTT 10F AT +11 28
#note trying to make this play too complicated, this does make it more likely I get a bingo down but also gives him cheap points. actually, quackle's favorite is TAN at 10G, which makes sense even though it bingos quite a bit less next turn (the 7 extra points are worth it and he has a harder time scoring)
>Avery_Mojica: DERRSUW 11E DREW +26 71
#note maybe waur?
>JD: AEENRTX H11 .AXEN +48 76

>Avery_Mojica: DDEIRSU --  -61 71
#note I played this before long long ago against alyssa
>JD: EEEERTT E4 TEETERE. +71 147
#note I was kicking myself for not at least thinking about leaving the play on the board to give myself teetered, without spotting the other spot...
>Avery_Mojica: DDEIRSU I12 DUD +22 93
#note but! I now give him sturdied. not always an easy find.
>JD: ABEILLW 14B BEWAIL.. +32 179
#note hoping he has all 1-pointers and can't play here
>Avery_Mojica: CEIIRST 10I ERISTIC +68 161
#note nice
>JD: ?EILOOR K1 wOOLIER +69 248
#note huge turning point in the game that I can't hit the 3x3, quackle says that playing LOOIE at 8A might almost be worth it but I would much rather get the bingo down.
>Avery_Mojica: AIJMRUY 2J J.RAM +60 221
#note juicy to clean up the rack looks worth the point sacrifice. he was trying to get plays down fast against me because I spent a long, long time looking for bingoes in CEILOOR? (only colorize)
>JD: AABGILM O10 .AMBIA +45 293
#note with two Gs left, thought about GAMBIA on the left instead but quackle agrees on this play. I think he held for a little bit
>Avery_Mojica: AFHINUY 15A YAH +36 257
#note unify would've helped clean his rack up a lot but this does actually sim quite close since it takes away a lot of cheap points for me and keeps the F for 13C
>JD: CGLNSUV 3M GUV +24 317
>Avery_Mojica: AFINNOU 4A FOUN.AIN +82 339
#note clutch find!
>JD: CLNNOOS 8A CLON. +24 341
#note I drop from ~75% to ~35% in one play, need every point I can get so NONCE would've definitely helped.
>Avery_Mojica: ?ADOQUZ 3G QUA +46 385
>JD: GNNOSST H1 ST..G +18 359
#note quackle likes a play like INGOTS to flip over as many tiles as possible, but then all avery has to do is block the lanes on the bottom-right and I don't really have a path to victory. My leave is unideal here but I don't see any other way to win at this point, even if I draw the Z or something. incidentally, if I play NONCE last time I have GOLFS this turn for 27 and I'm only down 11, so playing CLONE really cost me (I was under time pressure)
>Avery_Mojica: ?DFGOSZ B2 ZO. +24 409
#note grosz for 68! this does block though
>JD: LNNOOST K9 L.ON +8 367
#note after a level of analysis beyond what any sane person should perform of all the possible two and three-tile fishes, and constraining with the assumption that the only way to win is to hit the C on the left (he will almost certainly block the bottom-right) I conclude that I should've fished off NO somewhere aiming for LECTIONS, which is 5/90 (or 40/720). Second best is LO at 3/90 (24/720) fishing for NICOTINS, and my play is the best 3-tile fish with a 19/720 shot at bingoing, meaning that I sacrificed 21/720 winning equity (2.625%). my work here is done.
