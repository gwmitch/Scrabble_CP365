>Reid: AEGLOOR H6 GOO +8 8
#note GOO (51.35%) at 8G is #1. GOORAL (50.68%) at 8D is #2, and GOO (50.57%) at 8H is #3. My play is #4 (50.43%)
>Zev: GIW I7 WIG +24 24
>Reid: AEILLRY G5 LAY +26 34
#note #1 play.
>Zev: EEMZ J4 MEZE +45 69
>Reid: ACDILRT K2 CRIT +20 54
#note LAD (43.68%), TAD (41.68%), and RAD (41.18%) at K5 are 1-3. CRIT is #34 based on valuations from all choices. This is not a good play.
>Zev: EFIPTY 4C TEPIFY +46 115
#note Zev is able to get a phoney past me. I assumed there were two different spellings for tepefy. Big mistake here.
>Reid: ADEEHLM 5B HAME +32 86
#note HAME (28.25%) is #4. LAMEDH (30.96%) at L4, EDH (29.27%) at L3, and MALE (28.29%) at L4 are 1-3 respectively. Opening the triple word S hook is certainly not a good idea in lieu of the scoring optinos. Missed opportunities here.
>Zev: ERSTV A1 VERTS +37 152
>Reid: ADEEJLN 6F J.. +27 113
#note #1 play.
>Zev: ADNW L4 DAWN +31 183
>Reid: ADEEELN H1 EEL. +21 134
#note #1 play.
>Zev: IORU 2D OURI. +7 190
>Reid: AADEHNQ -  +0 134
#note It is unclear what transpired during this turn. I do not believe I exchanged, so it's possible I made some mistake and got a word challenged off. The only thing I have on my score sheet is the word GALAH. I dont have an L on my rack, so it's possible I misrecorded this rack as well. Whatever the case, I ended up with a zero score.
>Zev: ENOORSS 10C SOONERS +67 257
>Reid: AADEHNQ 11E HAD +29 163
#note #1 play.
>Zev: KOOT 12B KOTO +22 279
>Reid: AABENPQ 13A BAP +28 191
#note BAP (2.01%) is #2. BAP (2.65%) at 9E is #1. NAP (1.74%) at 13A is #3.
>Zev: AGIV M1 VAGI +23 302
>Reid: ?AEILNQ 9B QI +15 206
#note Missing REQUIN (14.29%) at H10 is the final mistake. QI (2.65%) is #2. QIS (2.19%) is #3 at C8
>Zev: IO A13 .IO +15 317
>Reid: ?ABELNX 1M .EX +39 245
#note VEX (5.54%) is #2. IBEX (6.83%) is #1 at 1M and BAL (4.79%) is #3 at 9E. While VEX is not that bad, IBEX is certainly better.
>Zev: CU 1H .CU +5 322
#note This is likely a balancing play, so Zev likely has the 2nd blank at this time.
>Reid: ?ABDLNU 6B AB +18 263
#note UNBALED (35.67%) at M7 is #1. BAL (17.83%) is #2, BUD (11.08%) at 8C is #3. My play is #4. Another huge mistake.
>Zev: EE 1A .EE +6 328
#note Likely still balancing.
>Reid: ?DFLNTU B12 ..F +30 293
#note KAF (21%) is #4. CLAD (24.5%) at 2K, DUN (22.67%) and DUNT (22.53%) at 7B are #2 and #3 respectively. REFUND (1.92%) at H10 is the highest scoring and would be a great choice if Zev did not already have the last blank.
>Zev: ?AEISTU M7 AUgITES +67 395
>Reid: ?DLNNTU 8M .N +2 295
#note TUNNEL at 12I, UNLET at 12J and CLAN at 2K are the top 3 choices. My play is #38 based on valuations from all choices. Im trying to create another bingo lane.
>Zev: ADILN 12I NAIL.D +14 409
#note Zev blocks my RUNDLETS.
>Reid: ?DLNRTU O4 DURNs +27 322
#note LAIRD, DRILL, and DRILY at K10 are apparently the top 3 choices. My play (#8) is tied for the highest scoring play of the top 15 choices offered by Quackle 5-min championship player. Quackle is trying to block Zev's out play. The spread is cut by 4 pts if this strategy is pursued.
>Zev: NR K11 R.N +6 415
>Zev:  (LT) +4 419
#note 12 of my 15 plays are in the top 10, 11 are in the top 4. There is an unknown error on turn 6 and a missed bingo. Overall I give myself a C+ this game.
