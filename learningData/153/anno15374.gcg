#note Mack gave me his racks for this game.

#note An option I didn't consider is WHA, which is also good. A simulation has these plays neck and neck.

#note DAUB/BAUD block a scoring spot and keep a very useful S and leave that is likely to bingo. Definitely better choices..

>Noah: ?DENRST 12F uNDREST +75 194
#note I wasn't sure about this rack. uNDREST scores highest by far, but D column bingos might give me a better chance to win, by keeping more lanes open. After uNDREST, lanes are easy to close down. Then again, I still have forking opportunities, mainly along line 13, and sometimes Mack may just not have a good rack for blocking. Also it's possible Mack doesn't control the board very well, but it's hard to say whether that's true, with so little data about his play.

#note We talked about this play for awhile. Turns out there is a sick play here that is clearly best.

#note Damn, I missed a lane here, and thus a bingo.

#note This is a tough play. We talked about it a bit after the game. I suggested TREATY to do basically the same thing and turn over more to get to the blank. Of course, that also leads to fewer balanced racks, and Mack doesn't have much of a lead here. AITY keeps balance. It also keeps WHARFAGE (the cool play I mentioned earlier) for next turn, though again, neither of us saw it. WHARFAGE could be correct here, but it sucks to give your opponent advantage on getting to the blank while leaving lanes open. What do you think about this play? It's tough, right? Mack's play seems good. Is it best?

#note Didn't want to lose if EROSIvE wasn't good for some reason. SOIREEs also plays there.
