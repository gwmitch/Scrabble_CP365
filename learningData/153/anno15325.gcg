#note looks to me like guaco is the play I wanted, leaving the good lanes untouched while keeping a decent leave. would've played it had I thought of it. I knew I had to really work to keep the board open given my past experience with scott's defensive style

#note lots to hit, not necessarily easy or worthwhile for him to block and I could always backdoor into merchant if he blocks for no points

#note tough choice between FINCA or FOCI, with either one he's likely to just play on row 4. maybe FINCA looking to hit the X?

#note after my subsequent draw I really thought I had him given that I knew he had no vowels...would've been less optimistic if I'd realized that I had 10 points less than I thought.
>Scott_Appel: MR G3 M.R +15 366
>JD: AAAENOS 2A ANOA +20 358
#note this was a tough deliberation between ANOA at 2A and AEON at 2B. ANOA afforded me a much better chance at an out, whereas AEON didn't allow for plays down from the A or cheap plays across on row 3. Eventually I went for drawing the out. the funny thing is that, thinking the score is 348-366, my best play is ANOA hoping to draw ANISE or the S, whereas at 338-366 I'm supposed to play AEON trying to draw the blank or the S for ASSAI and a 1 point win.

>JD: AENS --  -18 358
#note instead of finding anise under heavy time pressure, my warped brain comes up with what I think is a one point win with NAES*. I would have been kicking myself for missing anise, but of course the inevitable recount would've been bitter as well
