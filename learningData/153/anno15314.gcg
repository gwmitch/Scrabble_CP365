#note I failed to look for bingoes hooking BRITH with -SI-, MAGNESIC is definitely worth it. just a question of spread at this point. I figured I would just keep fishing until I hit row 15 if he didn't open it for me.

#note an interesting fish, I had to go through each of the racks and see what he would hit. he hits some racks no matter what (UNDRESS) but I eventually figured I would take the points. BUNKO catches up with BLEAK because it blocks DANSEUR at A3 (while still allowing sunders/sanders/sundaes on the right) but may be slightly better because I'm more likely to go out next turn with that leave.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADNRSSU M1 SUN +12 286
#note this is a smart play except that I have UNDOER to go out, which we both missed.
