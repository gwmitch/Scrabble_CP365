#note seemed that he was trying to play very defensively, he has this for 18 more points though

>Webster_Phillips: AARV O7 VARA. +24 78
>JD: BCDFINZ L8 BIF.D +28 143
#note seemed easier to generate points down the road with the Z, but more importantly I'm now well on my way to shutting the board permanently with a big lead since bifid doesn't hook...once I take care of ABYE it's going to be very hard for him to come back
>Webster_Phillips: AAMNTX 12D TAXMAN +36 114
>JD: CEILNNZ M7 ZIN +30 173
#note proceeding with the plan

>JD: CEEELNO L4 CEE +19 192
#note cee instead of nee just so that that quadrant really can't be opened anymore
>Webster_Phillips: IORT 13C TORI +21 135
>JD: ?EGLNOU 13H GENU +15 207
#note trying to find ways to keep the game moving while macking him open for me and my blank
>Webster_Phillips: GNPU 14K PUNG +18 153
>JD: ?AELLOQ 15J LO +7 214
#note quackle suggests the cheeky LO at 14G, but if I supply the blank the standard deviation of 14G increases dramatically. I'm fine with my move.
>Webster_Phillips: DHI 14B HID +20 173
>JD: ?AEELLQ 15A LEE +17 231
#note could burn the blank for QAT but having the blank makes me much better able to respond to setups.
>Webster_Phillips: AI 9C AI. +6 179
>JD: ?AFJLQS 6C JA.L +13 244
#note tough decision here. seems like I want to play off at least one power tile to avoid future disasters. dumping the Q and letting him take the bingo on column B might be advised, since I usually get such good playback, but I opted for a strategy that blocks two bingo lines (ABYE/-AC- still available). I'm happy with my choice on further analysis.
>Webster_Phillips: ARUW B9 WAUR +16 195
>JD: ?DFLOQS 11A S.Q +12 256
#note I took the opportunity to dump the Q, but I think DOLT at J4 should be better - block an easy scoring spot and drop his bingo percentage all the way to 0%. that said dropping the Q does make me much more flexible since I must do it sooner or later.
>Webster_Phillips: ?AEOPST 4G OuTPA.ES +70 265
#note I actually wasn't thinking about this spot at all during the game. quite the surprise. POSTRACE/POSTFACE gives him a much better chance I think, or even ASLOPE non-bingo.
>JD: ?DFLOWY 3C FLaWY +43 299
#note I was a little low on time from all the tricky moves earlier in the game, this is fine, top is DOW at 3M which forces KOS at N2 to block FLOSSY.
>Webster_Phillips: EEIKORU 2B REEK +28 293
>JD: DO 1D DO +17 316
#note quite the game.
