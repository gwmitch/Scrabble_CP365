#note I thought about WON 13K too. It's a tough decision. WON gives Carl scores that are a bit better next turn. Of course I also score better, as I have a stronger bingo leave, and there are better scoring spots open next turn. Of course, EINT isn't as conducive to the scoring spots. What about entropy? Well, what's the two plays don't seem very different in terms of entropy. What about long-term board dynamics? I still can't see much of a difference. The two plays seem very similar. What do you think, how to differentiate the plays?

#note I didn't think about the QI overlap possibility, but it's quite remote, as he almost certainly kept neither tile on his exchange.
