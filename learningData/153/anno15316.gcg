>Ross: EHY H7 YEH +18 18
>Reid: AELNUUU G9 UNAU +11 11
#note UNAU (37.13%) is #3. Strangely, ULU (#1, 38.29%) did not leap to mind during this play. I tried to fight through the horrible opening rack, but I have to agree with Quackle that dumping UUU (#2, 37.85%) is a better choice. I should have exchanged here, its still early and the leave is great.UNAU is poorly positioned.
>Ross: DEIOTV 12F O.TVIED +24 42
#note Obviously I don't have the full rack to judge, but this seems to be a horrible play. Perhaps it is a setup.
>Reid: DEILTUZ J8 UTIL.ZED +72 83
#note #1 play.
>Ross: AEJ 15H JA.E +36 78
>Reid: AMORSTW 8J .OTWAR +30 113
>Reid: AMORSTW --  -30 83
#note MEW (61.54%) at 14I, WORM (61.4%) at K5, and MEOW (60.98%) at 14I are 1-3. My play and carelessness is a huge mistake here. I meant to play OUTWAR.
>Ross: AFINR 8J .NFAIR +39 117
#note I thought this play was apropos in lieu of my bungle.
>Reid: AMORSTW 13C WORM +22 105
#note #1 play.
>Ross: GHT D12 G.TH +24 141
>Reid: ?ABFSTY 14I F.Y +19 124
#note FEY (48.63%) is #5 according to 5-min championship player. FASH (49.52%) and BATHS (48.89%) at 15A are #1 and #3 respectively. BEY (49.30%) at 14I is #2. While it is early in the game, I usually don't play my S for 30 pts.
>Ross: LSU 15A LUS. +21 162
#note This seemed like a waste of an S to me, but perhaps he had 2.
>Reid: ?ABDPST M7 B.P +13 137
#note TOMB (49.68%) is #3 and PA (49.09%) is #3, but BAPTISED (56.54%) is #1. Missing the bingo is unacceptable. BAP (46.83) is #7 even though it clogs up some bingo lanes.
>Ross: EX 14A EX +38 200
>Reid: ?ADNSTV 15H ....D +16 153
#note VINAS (30.59%) and DIVAS (29.93%) at 10I are the top 2 choices. JADED (29.23%) is #3. I had also considered DAVY (#4, 28.60%) at 7E and VID (#7, 27.20%) at 10I.
>Ross: NOOS 11J .OONS +17 217
#note I think Ross is trying to block the bottom half of the O lane w/ this play. Otherwise, it's a rather silly play. Again, he may have another S.
>Reid: ?ACNSTV 7E CAV. +16 169
#note #1 play.
>Ross: DIP F6 P.ID +20 237
>Reid: ?AINSTT O1 INSTATe. +74 243
>Reid: ?AINSTT --  -74 169
#note NYSTATIN (33.28%) at K1 is #1, TANiSTRY (28.62%) at O2 is #2, TAG (25.84%) at 12B has a great leave and creates a triple bingo hook. I was desperate for a bingo and talked myself into playing the phoney even though I'm familiar with its 4 anagrams. Missing bingos here essentially ends the game.
>Ross: AEIILST O3 LISTE.IA +59 296
>Reid: ?AINSTT K1 NySTATI. +64 233
#note NYSTATIN (4.41%) is #2. OSTINATI (4.68%) is #1 at 4H, and TITANESS (4.28%) at 5H is #3.All the other 6 bingos that are playable are in the 5 lane.  Another mistake here. I was proud of this play until now.
>Ross: AMO J2 MOA +24 320
#note Ross continues to shut the board down.
>Reid: AEEEEEI -EEEEI +0 233
#note My exchange of EEEEI is #7 (1.83%). Quackle wants to dump everything but the I (3.57%). I think it's silly to not at least keep an E. I suppose this rack is fitting consider all the missed opportunities leading up to it.
>Ross: GOW I3 WOG +24 344
>Reid: AEGIORR C11 RA. +9 242
#note GROG (1.92%) at 12A is #3. ROC (2.77%) at E5 is #1 and WIS (2.817%) at C13 is #2. I attempt to create a bingo hook with my play. GROG does the same thing, but it has a better leave. My play is #34 according to valuations from all choices.
>Ross: KOR B10 KOR +23 367
#note Ross shuts down the bingo lane.
>Reid: EEGINOR E5 RO. +14 256
#note Quackle apparently thinks that Ross is going to open the board for me. According to 5-min championship player, GOATEE (0.07%) at 4H, and SENGI and SINGE at N11 round out the top 3. My play is #21 based on valuations from all choices. I played ROC to open another bingo lane. I'm just trying to reduce spread
>Ross: ER F4 RE.... +11 378
>Reid: CEEGINQ D4 QI +25 281
#note My play is #4. QI at N4 is #1. QIS at 5M and NIECE at 1K are #1-3. I'm okay with my play here. Even Quackle finally realizes this game is unwinnable.
>Ross: EIN 1K .INE +5 383
>Reid: ?BCEEGN N11 .CENE +14 295
#note I had failed to track properly this game (typical), so I was unaware of Ross's out. I believed I could get another turn. RECOATED at 4F, COATEE at 4H, and CELEB at C5 round out the top 3. The top 2 plays block his out while scoring well. My play is #9 based on valuations from all choices and is a horrible play.
>Ross: AEEL N3 ALEE +16 399
>Ross:  (GB?) +10 409
#note Two missed bingos this game, two lost challenges. I failed to properly track as well. 10 of my 15 plays were in the top 10 and 8 of those were in the top 5. This game was lost early but was still winnable at turn 6. Overall I give myself an F for this game.
