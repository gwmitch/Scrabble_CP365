#note Quackle likes this play a lot, to my surprise. This was a tough play because of the leave, but blocking the 3x3 was necessary I think especially considering there aren't other good scoring options eleswhere. VA(LI)D isn't too bad either, it's defiitely worth considering.

#note Quackle likes LOAF 12A by about a whole two points over my play. It also like K6 OFAY, but that's pretty dangerous for only 21 points.

#note Nice find. Only bingo.
>Joey_Krafchick: AACDEFR 8J ARCADE +40 283
#note My draw into AAF bailed me out for sure. Quackle likes CA(LI)F for 28, leaving ADER, by about 1 point. This board isn't great for bingoing, especially with no blanks unseen, so I think rather than being fixated on bingoing I should just take the 12 extra points.

#note Championship player says play SEI 5K. I figure because I have the last S I should save it for that spot in the pre-endgame/endgame. (F)IG is 2 points worse. I also considering GO(F)ER which is another high option, but I'm not taking the risk of having 3 I's on my rack in the endgame.

>Joey_Krafchick: EIIORSY 6M OY +35 378
#note The only unseen bingo possiblility I see would be PATENTO(R), which leaves him a very small chance of bingoing, 1/8 I believe? I figure I take my 35 point play instead of sacrificing points by blocking row 13. Championship player says my player is fine, winning 75% of the time, along with SOY and SEI 5K.
