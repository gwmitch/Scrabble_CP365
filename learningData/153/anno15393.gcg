#note Interesting rack. All I could think of was (W)EAL and exchange and this, but EAU G7 is also an option. I'm fine making this play and blocking the most dangerous line on the board.

>Noah: AACHOOZ K5 ZOA +28 309
#note AZO ZOA and COHO appear to be the options here. I didn't choose COHO because the Z did not seem that strong post-COHO and a sim says I am correct. AZO vs. ZOA. You can more fruitfully parallel ZOA than AZO with ACHO, but on the other hand, ZOA makes it harder for Joel to make openings on column L. I'm fine with ZOA.

#note This is Joel's actual rack, which we talked about after the game. It's an interesting rack. Wanting to preserve the CHINOOKS hook, there are a lot of plays he can't do, like TYPE 12K and even PYE L6. He did this over GaPY because plays off the Y opened the board for him. Other options look like YET L7, TYPE 5C, UNPEG 4C and PYE B1. The blank is quite useful here...maybe YET? Interesting play.

#note I didn't see (Y)ODH here. It's the other option worth considering.
