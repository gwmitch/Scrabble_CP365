>Leesa: ACEKLSY 8G LACKEYS +90 90
>Reid: DEEEIUW L4 WEED. +24 24
#note #1 play. 
>Leesa: BFO K3 FOB +29 119
>Reid: EEILORU J8 .UE +9 33
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, OLE (12.86%) at M3, OILER (12.56%) at M2, and LOUIE (12.06) at 9D are #1-3 respectively. KUE is #8 based on valuations from all choices.
>Leesa: IQTU 10F QUIT. +34 153
>Reid: DEGILOR M2 GOLD +24 57
#note GOLD (8.15%) is #5. GIRO (8.81%) at J2, LOG (8.66%) at J4 is #1. LOG (8.66%) at J4 and IDOL at J3 are tied for #2. DOG (8.42%) at J4 is #3. I agree with Quackle here. GIRO scores a little more, also has a good leave but creates 2 vital bingo lanes.
>Leesa: ACO J3 OCA +26 179
>Reid: EEEIJLR 7E JEE +14 71
#note JEE (4.65%) is #2. REI (4.84%) and LEI (4.55%) at 11D are #1 and #3 respectively. Things were nto looking good. This doesn't use the J well, but I didn't want to keep lugging it around in my rack.
>Leesa: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 179
#note Obviously rack is unknown. With such a large lead, Leesa can afford the luxury of an exchange.
>Reid: EGIILNR 11D GRIN +23 94
#note A nice rack and nothing to do with it. GRIN (7.16%) is #10. LI (8.73%) and GIN (7.85%) at 11E are #1 and #3. REI (7.878%) at 11D is #2. I agree with Quackle that keeping the ING is important, but I was getting tired of balancing and decided to use my G for points. REJIG (#4, 7.76%) at E5 is the highest scoring of the top 15 plays.
>Leesa: EFH 6F FEH +33 212
>Reid: ?BEILNO 12C BO +14 108
#note BO (7.88%) is #14. BINGO (10.86%), BIOGEN (10.61%), and BILGE (10.11%) at D8 are #1-3. Apparently, scoring is more important here. The blank makes all the leaves in the top 3 strong.
>Leesa: ?ANPRSZ 2D PANZeRS +79 291
#note While it didn't matter, I had forgotten SOCA was valid in the new dictionary.
>Reid: ?EILMNT M8 .MELTINg +74 182
#note SMELTING (1.48%) is #2. SMALTINE (1.69%), STILLMEN (1.19%) are #1 and #3 respectively. 
>Leesa: DEIOV 8A VIDEO +39 330
>Reid: EIIINOY 15K YO.IN +24 206
#note YOGIN (0.17%) is #3. YONI (0.21%) is #1 at 13C. Exchanging IIIOY (0.18%) is #2.
>Leesa: AA 3F AA +17 347
#note Leesa finally has to balance!
>Reid: AEIILNX N10 XI +52 258
#note Missing EXILIAN (9.16%) is horrible here. Until now, I thought this game was played pretty well. XI is #3 based on valuations from all plays. IXIA at N9 is #2 based on such valuations. With 2 I still out, IXIA is probably worth the extra 8 pts and opened triple bingo lane.
>Leesa: DORU 1A DURO +23 370
>Reid: AEHILNN 1H HA +29 287
#note HA (0.57%) is #7. LEAN (0.72%) at 13B, HAUL (0.68%) at 9H, and HAEN (0.63%) at D6 are #1-3 respectively.
>Leesa: GIP 4D PIG +16 386
>Reid: AEILNNR 5D AN +12 299
#note According to Quackle 5-min championshpi player, EARN (4.9%) and ERN (4.57%) at 13C are #1 and #2. AIRN (3.93%) at 13B is #3. AIRN blocks up 2 bingo lanes. I specifically didn't want to play at 13C because I didn't want to plug up another lane. AN is #15 based on valuations from all choices.I don't think my is that bad.
>Leesa: ETV 6B VET +19 405
#note Not sure why Leesa didn't play VET at 13B for more points to block the lane.
>Reid: AEILNRT 13B RETINAL +78 377
#note #1 play.
>Leesa: ERST 12K RE.S +18 423
>Reid: AMOTUW N1 MOW +27 404
#note MOW is #5. DAUT, DUMA, and DATUM at A1 are the top 3. Those 3 plays block Leesa's out. I had mistracked and I thought she had TIES, so I didn't see any way to stop her outs and thus went for the points.
>Leesa: IRST A1 .IRTS +7 430
>Leesa:  (ATU) +6 436
#note This game was officially scored at 400 because I incorrectly scored RETINAL as 74 instead of 78. I missed a bingo. 10 of 13 plays are in the top 10. 8 of 13 plays are in the top 5. I wasn't able to track properly. Overall, I give myself a C+ this game.
