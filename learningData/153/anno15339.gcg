#note intriguing, the J is such a hindrance on this wide open board that quackle likes JEED at 13G opening another triple because I bingo 55% next turn off of my ELRV leave! not sure if that move would occur to me over the board, but I guess it dos make sense.

#note trying to get too cute, should just take the points and move on with the nice ACLR leave. what am I planning on doing with CFIRX on my rack? two blanks unseen, game's not over yet

>JD: CFIORSX B7 C.IF +17 270
#note more weirdness, why not just play XI for the 110 point lead? coif just makes me much less responsive if he does somehow bingo.

>JD: INORSSX O8 ORNIS +32 302
#note should absolutely tack on the S for ROSINS with two blanks and another S unseen, definite mistake

#note well, I played really stupidly for most of the middle of that game, but I guess it doesn't matter. most likely wound up costing myself a lot of spread though.
