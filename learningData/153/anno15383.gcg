#note Wasn't sure about this play. Thought about YEA, AME(N)ITY, (G)AIETY and YAM. (G)AMEY and YE(N) are options I didn't consider. I played GAIETY because it kept the board much more open than YEA while not opening as much scoring as AME(N)ITY and keeping a better leave than AMENITY, and I have started this game down a bit. YEA actually sims better than this because it decreases Scott's bingo chances to almost 3/5 of what they are after (G)AIETY. It makes even more sense because DINGY likely kept either low-scoring tiles or the X. On the other hand, I don't really like making a play closing the board and putting me down. GAIETY may have worse equity than YEA, but I think it has a better entropy too, which is probably what I want here. In that case, AMENITY could be a better play, because it opens up the top of the board and the bottom of the board. I may have overestimated the scoring it gives up as well--it's not very dangerous.

#note PROF is also an option. I guess they're pretty close.

#note Thought about VOWE(L) and CIVI(L). I chose this because CII looked like a terrible leave for scoring here, and bingoing didn't seem likely with it either. The WOE seems like an okay combination though, despite the EEOO in the pool. That was my judgment. Was I right? I don't really know. Anyone have input here? I don't see a sim being enlightening here because I'm going into a pre-endgame situation the next turn. I'm not sure how to determine which play is better.

#note JOE is a better play, because it's harder to block.
