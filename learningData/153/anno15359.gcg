#note OI (24.08%) is #7. REPAIR (28.03%) at C3, PRAIRIE (27%) at C4, and AIRIER (26.42%) at C6 are #1-3 respectively. Not using the Q here is a mistake.
>Robert: AEIMSTZ 10I MAZIEST +76 176
>Reid: ADEIPRT 11E DIPTERA +119 174
#note #1 play.
>Robert: AHLOS 12K SHOAL +30 206
#note SHOAL at 10B is higher scoring, but Robert is likely blocking here.
>Reid: GHOOORR H11 .HORO +36 210
#note #1 play.
>Robert: N 4D N.. +12 218
>Reid: ACGIMOR 10D CAM +26 236
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, OTALGIC (51.04%) at O9 is #1, CORGI (49.14%) and GAMIC at 5I are tied for #2, and MIG (48.91%) at 13L is #3. CAM is #28 based on valuations from all plays.
>Robert: ADEGIIN 14D DEAI.ING +64 282
>Reid: CGINORR 15K ORGIC +30 266
#note ORGIC (23.20%) is #2. GIRON (24.94%) and RIGOR (25.4%) at 15A are #1 and #3 respectively. Not sure why my play is not #1. It scores more and seems to have a better leave. Perhaps there are too many N left? More than likely, taking out 15A spot preempts scoring from opponent.
>Robert: EFLO 15A FLOE +28 310
>Reid: ABNRTUU O6 BUTU. +21 287
#note BUTUT (14.77%) is #2. AUBURN (16.03%) is #1 at 5J and TABUN (14.14%) is #3 at 5I.

>Robert: ?DEEGST 4H EGESTeD +72 422
>Reid: ?IIKNOR N2 NO.I +10 347
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, REINK at M3, KIND at N1, KEIR at 12A are the top 3 choices. While I see Robert's out and block it, there were many higher scoring plays. My play is not even in the top 50 based on valuations from all plays.
