#note Would anyone choose another play, like DEUTZIA, TAXIED etc.? They don't seem worth it to me but I'm curious if I'm missing something.

#note I was really frustrated during most of this game, and had one of my worst attitudes about the game. I kept thinking my mantra for this tournament, roughly "Find the best play, don't worry about anything else", but it was hard. I've talked about this before in my annotated games, but much of this feeling is about respect. My disrespect for Amit as a player makes me mad because I felt like he was getting so lucky this game. I need to respect players and embrace that any player has a chance of winning against anyone else to get over this. I need to continue to focus on the best play rather than other unnecessary things. Anyway, I missed a better spot for these tiles.

#note I thought about FAENA and FAIN, but didn't think about FA. According to Quackle, FA simply increases my equity too much not to play it, and that seems correct to me.

#note Probably the most frustrating play of the game, see my earlier comment.
>Noah: EGIIOOS 2H O.I +24 258
#note Tough decision, and i considered OBI and GOODIE. Surprised to see OBI actually has a much better average score than GOODIE for me next turn...I guess because the pool is so consonant-heavy. In that case, OBI seems like the clear choice. At the time though, I wasn't too sure about the EGIOS leave, even though OBI scored more and seemed to leave the board more open.

#note Really wasn't sure about this play. My goal was to outscore Amit with a lucky draw here, scoring points to help make that possible. Plays on row 15 seemed hopeless, as they didn't score enough. I wonder if RATOON M5 could work, hoping to draw something good on column N while he has little there. But when does this actually happen? Anyone see a creative shot for a win here? Just an awful position as far as I can see.
