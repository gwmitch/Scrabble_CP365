#note I insta-played this. This is probably one of the worst things I did this tournament: played too quickly. I could've played VOE here. I'm not sure I would've (though I can't see why it would be a bad idea), but I certainly should've at least thought of it and about it.

#note Played too quickly again, perhaps. Though I did look for a while on his time, so maybe I just wouldn't have seen the play here period. It's OUTTUR(N).

#note Actual rack. It looks like BEACHIER was missed here.
>Noah: ?DEOOPU C1 D.OOP +26 242
#note Man...missed ROUP! This appears to be better than normal because of the consonant heavy pool, though the U is never that great. Even if this is better than ROUP, it's still a play I should've thought of.

>Noah: ??EEMUY B9 MY +32 274
#note Interesting rack! I thought about MY B9, EYE L4, and MUlEY L1. As far as I can tell, these are still the options worth considering. I suppose MY L4 is also an option, but I like keeping the (PROEM)S hook open. This is also why I didn't like EYE, and to some extent MUlEY. MUlEY is a bit different as a play though, as it scores quite a bit better than other plays. I'm still not a big fan though. It opens up a place to play the Q for one thing, while making me more vulnerable to Q draws. EEU?? really isn't that bad with such a consonant heavy pool. I think I'm still okay with this play. Are there things I haven't explored about it, though? You tell me!

#note I considered this, EXpULSE, cULEXEs, and LUrEXEs and (V)EX. Didn't really see the point in play (V)EX over this. It just didn't look this play yielded bad draws. The Q is not a problem, and if I don't get it, he does, and I should have the advantage, with my points. Plays on column M can lead to a Q-stick loss.

>Noah: ??AEELU M3 EUcLAsE +76 392
#note Did I just not think of fishing here? I knew this would lose to a J-stick. I can just play something like (EM)U and win all the time.
