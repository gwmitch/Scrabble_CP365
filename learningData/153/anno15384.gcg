#note Saw CHADAR, but wasn't 100%. I actually liked this better, and sim agrees

#note I see a ton of possibilities immediately. I know Whitley knows all the words too, so it'll for sure get extended at some point. It would take a while though..

#note yeahyeah
>Nick_Fraher: ADEEEIY 12K EYED +21 181
#note An interesting position. EYE F5 sims better for obvious reasons, as does EYE 12K, which I just wasn't gonna play.I saw them both, but I had some bogus reasoning about why I should play EYED instead. (-4)

>David_Whitley: EORU I5 ROU.E +16 183
#note Down 100, he needs to open
>Nick_Fraher: EILMOUU F4 MOUE +13 254
#note Unfortunately, I can't capitalize or do much of anything. Sim lat 4 play likes  H1 LOUIE, but I'm scared of it. David's a great player and can easily fork it or blow the board wide open. Just too much entropy for me
>David_Whitley: ENTT O7 TENT +18 201
>Nick_Fraher: ?AEIILU N4 LIEU +8 262
#note I miss the only really solid plays here, 4B ILIUM/ILEUM. Board vision Nick, aargh. They score better than anything else, clean up the rack, and only give him an I to play through while opening up a line for myself. This is such a good play, can't believe I missed it. LIEU 3rd in the sim, (-15). (God that's a lot)
>David_Whitley: BKO E3 KOB +30 231
#note Continues to outscore me and groom his rack
>Nick_Fraher: ?AEIIQR O3 QI +15 277
#note I should really have seen his bingo lane, but what am I gonna do with this rack anyway? Slightly behind D4 RAI in the sim. The more I think about it, the more I like RAI. If he does bingo, I have big comebacks on 1 with my Q. Plus, I'm unlikely to bingo on this board, so why not save it for points. This is just me falling into patterns instead of thinking outside the box. (-2)
>David_Whitley: ?EEESVW J1 WEEVErS +72 303
#note sneaks in the unlikely bingo
>Nick_Fraher: ?AEIORT 1J .AITER +30 307
#note oh my god, he only gave me a W. I'm not a fatalist, but every game with him turns out like this. We discussed this play at club for a good while, but I stood by waiter over other possibilities. 
>David_Whitley: ADNNRTT D4 TAN +21 324
>Nick_Fraher: ?ADOPTY K5 PAT +28 335
#note PA doesn't empty the bag, but I wanted to give myself as many changes at WINGEDLY/WINGOVER/WINGLIKE/WINGIEST as possible. (-3)
>David_Whitley: ELST 15A ....LETS +36 360
#note oh cmon. of course. I have to desperation challenge after realizing it's unwinnable in endgame (I'm holding DIIOUY? and he has two outs)
>Nick_Fraher: ?DIIOUY -  +0 335
>David_Whitley: DNR 2I R.ND +10 370
