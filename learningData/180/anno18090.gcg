>Josh: ADEHIRX H8 RADIX +42 42
#note Championship game, we're both 2-1. I don't have good spread so I need to win to be in the money. A good start as I draw better than average for a first turn.
>Emanuel: BOW G11 BOW +25 25
>Josh: EHILOPQ 12D PHL.. +34 76
#note But now that QOPH is blocked, I can no longer play my Q. Given that getting rid of the Q is the most important thing for me to do next turn I feel like I should set it up somehow. I therefore considered PEH at I7 and PHL(OX) to try and figure out if they were worth taking over the standard play of POH or HOP overlapping Emanuel's last play. POH in my opinion is far better than HOP because Emanuel is more likely to bingo before me at this point with the Q in hand for another turn, so I should be reducing his opportunities. POH doesn't take any hooks. But I felt like the opening I created with PHL(OX) was quite unlikely to be blocked without creating a new spot for QI. I'm wondering if I'm wrong about any of this. I think I need to set my Q up somehow, and PEH seemed to be more likely to fail than PHL(OX). Hmm...
>Emanuel: EHU 11C HUE +26 51
#note well damn, that wasn't supposed to happen.
>Josh: EEEIOQR -EEIOQ +0 76
#note Maybe my play was wrong! :P
>Emanuel: ACINOSU 14A ACINOUS +81 132
>Josh: AEIIKNR A12 AR.K +27 103
#note I really really didn't want to leave a huge spot open but maybe I should... (BI)KINI looks good, (D)IKE or (BI)KIE even more. But that's good for me and only me, it gives Emanuel a lot more points though. But my possible leaves are just so bad, so maybe I need to focus on grooming my own rack and hope that he doesn't have something hard-hitting.
>Emanuel: EFY 10B FEY +30 162
>Josh: CDEEIIN 10H .ICE +13 116
#note Damn I was close to knowing EDENIC but I wasn't sure enough of it. It plays at 15G. That's a 20-point mistake right there. 
>Emanuel: GILRU K9 R.GULI +14 176
>Josh: ADEIMMN 15D AIMED +46 162
#note And another really useful 6, DAIMEN, plays at 15C for 52 here. Perhaps ADMEN in the same spot is better than this too. Upon further analysis it looks like it. But DAIMEN for sure!
>Emanuel: AEU J13 EAU +11 187
#note A break!
>Josh: ?FIMNNR 9A RIF +28 190
#note So it was between C13 N(I)M and 9A RIF for me here, and I decided to play RIF for some reason. That reason was that there weren't any great spots to bingo and I felt that since Emanuel was most likely to play to the R in RIF, I would have a good bingo lane to work with next turn most of the time he plays to the R, and if he doesn't, well then I can make use of the triple word score. But my leave is just so much worse that it's probably not a good idea to do what I did. My bingo percentage drops 25% between RIF and N(I)M apparently! So I'm really not making the right plays this game.
>Emanuel: ?EEISTY A2 YEaSTIE. +80 267
>Josh: ?EIMNNV I7 VEN.N +23 213
#note This time I considered V(I)M and VEN(I)N, and again I should have considered N(I)M. I felt like keeping two Ns was a bad plan, since 1) there were three of them left and 2) if I can't bingo next turn I most likely can't score either, which is important. This is why I played VENIN, but NIM would work with that logic too. 
>Emanuel: ADOOPRT B1 PORT +25 292
#note Actual rack. B2 ORDO looks right. B1 TARDO also looks good, as well as L10 DOT.
>Josh: ?BEIMNT G3 BITuMEN +74 287
>Emanuel: ADIOV H1 VOID +39 331
>Josh: AGOQRTZ 6F Q.A +31 318
#note Q, we meet again. I'm in trouble. I felt like I couldn't just not play my Q since I can score with my Z later on. I mean that factor alone should eliminate ZOA for 41, because I'm stuck playing QI for 22 next turn. But wait! I didn't noticed that ZOA set up Q(AID) too! So that makes ZOA good enough, I imagine. I still don't think it's correct, since the Z is just so much more flexible than the Q anyhow... Not sure what to think now.
>Emanuel: AELO E3 OLEA +20 351
>Josh: AGORTWZ C2 WAT +29 347
#note Gotta play this over (O)RZO I think. Not sure though. I feel like ORZO gives far too much back
>Emanuel: ALNOT 3G ..TONAL +20 371
>Emanuel: ALNOT --  -20 351
#note The real boiling point of this game has arrived. Emanuel plays a Collins-only 7 that I instachallenge off.

Now that I've caught a break, I need to figure out what BITONAL means for Emanuel's last two tiles.
>Josh: DGGORSZ 13I G..D +8 355
#note So I see that BITONAL would have opened up J2. So I immediately infer that Emanuel has a J. I then figure he doesn't have an S as he would just play J(AI)L for 11 in that case. So I shoot.

What I failed to notice was that if Emanuel had the J, he would have J(EL)LO as a clear play for 40. So therefore I can't infer a J, right? Well it seems weird that he would grant a huge J spot from his play. He did think about it for many minutes... So instead of being baffled I make the wrong inference, even though it's still unlikely he holds the other S here.
>Emanuel: AELNOOT 11K .O +3 354
#note So this was Emanuel's real rack. He wanted to fish and partially block what I set up.
>Josh: GORSSTZ 2H .RZOS +34 389
#note So I didn't play GROSZ because I was sure it was a loss at this point since I was under the impression that Emanuel had JETE or JEAN for sure. But after (G)O I really should have realized that something was up. I just didn't have time to figure out what was going on. This play loses if JN is in the bag, which is kind of probable in reality after (G)O. I don't think there is a sure win here.
>Emanuel: AEEJLNT 1L AJEE +39 393
#note -4 to (S)EJEANT. Since I had almost no time left SEJEANT might have caused me to lose as it would grant me no out. 
>Josh: GNOST M7 TONGS +12 401
#note -11 to NOGS M10, but I had the win and that's all that mattered. I was out of time anyway. What a crazy game this was.
>Josh:  (LNT) +6 407
