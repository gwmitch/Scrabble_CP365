>Geoff: ?DERRTY 8H DERRY +26 26
#note Tied with 8F DRY. A bit surprised: didn't figure playing short to be worth it here.
>El_Pato: ADNNOSU 7I DOUN +21 21
>Geoff: ?EEPTUY 9I YEP +31 57
#note No bingo yet, so let's take some points. UEY# 9G 25 opens things a little more and leaves better, but YEP still beats it by 3-4 in the sim.
>El_Pato: ACEINSS 10C INCASES +69 90
>Geoff: ?EGINTU D6 UNTI.GEd +68 125
#note Too many choices. Figured that scoring 2 less was worth knocking out the C and E columns. D8 TENURING opens up and scores 4 more. Not really convinced that's a great idea against Quackle...
>El_Pato: EFLOOSV F4 FOVEOL.S +72 162
>Geoff: HLMMQVW 9C Q. +42 167
#note Don't have to think too hard about this one.
>El_Pato: ?EFGOTZ E3 FEZ +57 219
>Geoff: HILMMVW C3 WHIM +28 195
#note Another clear choice, despite the unhappy LMV leave.
>El_Pato: ?CDGOTX E10 .OX +41 260
>Geoff: ELMRTUV C12 VERT +29 224
#note VET same spot a bit better in equity, but VERT tops the list in win percentage.
>El_Pato: ?CDEEGT 15A DE.ECT +30 290
>Geoff: AALMNOU B2 LOUMA +39 263
#note Fits in there nicely. Nice to have then for N(AMU)#, too. (Also for DETECTION, which could certainly come up.)
>El_Pato: ?AGIOTU 14F AUTOInG +65 355
#note Gah.
>Geoff: AAILNRS 5E ..ARIAL +32 295
#note Scores, keeps the A-column N hook, possible future opening via plays from H1. Best by 3 over A5 ANIL.
>El_Pato: AADHNOR A2 ADHAN +46 401
#note Pretty.
>Geoff: IIKLNOS 15L OINK +31 326
#note Quackle likes KI(T)S a point more, or IKON 15L, or KOI 13I. Very minor differences. I thought DOUN# might take an S (was thinking some word like that did - it was DOONA#), so negative kudos to me for that.
>El_Pato: EEINORT A8 ORIENTE. +80 481
#note Ok, that's enough.
>Geoff: EIIJLST H10 .EJI.S +63 389
#note So there.
>El_Pato: AABGPRW 4J BAWR +24 505
>Geoff: BILT O12 BIL. +13 402
#note BIRL H3 7 blocks Quackle's out play, but it works out the same on spread.
