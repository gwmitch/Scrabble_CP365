#note Not much else to do here.
>El_Pato: EHNOOSZ J6 ZE.O +33 33
>Geoff: EIJNNOR K3 REJON +37 49
#note A point better than JEON in the same spot. Could get hit back pretty hard, but it's early.
>El_Pato: EHINOOS L4 HOO +43 76
>Geoff: EINNOOP K9 POON +16 65
#note Eh, chicken play. M6 NOOP# 23 opens L8, I7 PROO# keeps two N's, didn't think of PRION# I7, M6 NOPE is 21 and keeps an I instead of an E. My play doesn't really accomplish much. 6-point error, maybe.
>El_Pato: AEIKNSS 13G KINASES +91 167
>Geoff: EILNSTU 11F ELUTI.NS +58 123
#note Oh, dangit, UNTILES# 9B 66. I still think of that group as having three, not four - ancient remnants of TWL disease. I liked this better than INSULTER to obscure H12, but Quackle doesn't agree.
>El_Pato: AAEIMUW 10F WAME +38 205
>Geoff: AADHTVY H13 .VY +27 150
#note Whiffed on DAVY 12C, which seems right, and M6 TAVAH(S)#, which seems righter still.

>Geoff: AADEEHT 14F TA.AH +42 192
#note Yay, finally got my headquarters out of my hindquarters and made a good play.

#note Ok, back in it.

#note Easy. Board isn't very bingo-friendly, though...
>El_Pato: EILORTY N2 ROILY +57 334
>Geoff: AEILSTV O1 VEST +31 331
#note Didn't see 15A SILVAE, jeez, but don't think I'd have played it anyway. I need to keep vowels and that O1-O4 line can't just sit there. VEST sims best, very close to VESTA (I want to keep the case A) and 12C LIVE (I did think of playing there but decided against it)
>El_Pato: DEEFFTX M1 FED +25 359
>Geoff: AGILMNU J2 GUM +20 351
#note Right spot, wrong idea. Why not LUM (I have both the last A and the last G) or just UM? Though GUM does set up -ING. UM is at 43.5%, 12A LIGNUM 40.6%, 1H INGULF (didn't see it, would have probably played it) 37.82%, GUM 37.5%, LUM 37.4%. Other problem is that if Quackle has the U, a block at I1 is possible (though I might get something back from it)
>El_Pato: CEFNTUX I1 FUN +14 373
>Geoff: ?ADILLN 12D LIN +12 363
#note Think I absolutely have to block WEX here, and Quack agrees but prefers LID instead. Not sure why; I want to keep it for IF or oF/DUG H1. LID 65%, LIN 61%, everything else way back.
>El_Pato: CDEITWX 15E DEW. +23 396
>Geoff: ?ADILP H1 ID +29 392
#note 1E PILAF wins 100%. I saw PILAfF (doesn't win) but not PILAF. Ouch ouch ouch. 
>El_Pato: CITX 13C XI +20 416

#note Best I can do.
>El_Pato: CT 10M .C. +11 427
>Geoff: A 14N A. +10 423
#note A very winnable 2-point loss, to say the least. Let's see: leaving points on the table with POON, not coming up with UNTILES#, not seeing ZOOT/TAVAHS#, playing GUM instead of something better, missing PILAF. All those plays were findable with my skill set. That's not advanced strategy; that's just making the shots. But I'm not saying this to get down on myself here - it's a challenging game, and it's supposed to be. A great many players can make top plays here and there, but doing so game in and game out is really hard. Steady, consistent play-finding more than anything else makes the very best players what they are. And it should tell you that a whole lot more games are winnable than you think, even given the luck of the draw.
