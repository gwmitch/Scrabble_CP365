>Spherulitic: EINNOSW 8G NOW +12 12
#note NOW to set up more hooks with a good leave. ENOW takes the mouse so if he hooks it I might still have a spot. 
>Winter: AFL F8 ALF +21 21
#note ANOW doesn't take the mouse.
>Spherulitic: EHINNSX 7F HIN +22 34
#note Setting up the mouse in another place, even if just for an X play next turn.

#note My goodness.

>Winter: AGORT K8 GROAT +19 143
>Spherulitic: EGJNSTT J11 JET +21 146
#note JET E5 is probably better but, ugh it kills the upper right quadrant. I hate doing that.
>Winter: EILORST 14I ESTRIOL +81 224
>Spherulitic: DEGLNST 15E GLENT +20 166
#note GLED / GELD Is the better equity play.
>Winter: AY 15N YA +26 250
>Spherulitic: ?ADIINS L4 AvIDINS +80 246
#note Quackle has L8 INDIA very close ahead of bingoing here. Giving up 35 to keep S? on a board with now two sweet S hooks, hmm...
>Winter: OTW 13G TOW. +22 272
>Spherulitic: CEINPRR M13 R.P +18 264
#note Wow the right play is really cool and I completely missed the spot!
>Winter: ATUV E4 VAUT +21 293
>Spherulitic: BCEIKNR 6J BR.CK +29 293
#note This is an interesting spot. There's BRICK, there's GIBER, there's something like M2 KEB.... If opp has S? I'm unlikely to win anyway. If he's got the mouse he'll hit O column for like 30 and I'll have another shot at a bing thru one of the A's. The other plays have plusses and minuses similarly -- GIBER scores less, hard to block and score but easier to bing; KEB could give awa a play on N column that scores 30, or a 2J play that scores 40. Dunno.
>Winter: EIPS O6 SIPE +32 325
#note Before putting this down he put down SEPIA would would be a sweet Z setup (except with the Z he'd have SIZE or SPAZ or something so nevermind.)
>Spherulitic: AEEILNR 4D A.E +12 305
#note So damn annoying. I need to create something else he'll play on row 5 and kill everything. As it stands he can still block everyting with a play at 5D or something.
>Winter: AEZ 9C ZEA. +23 348
>Spherulitic: EHILNOR N6 .HOR +22 327
#note Q likes HOLIER here, leaving one in the bag and leaving miracle bingo lanes thru the H and thru the A, or perhaps thru the K. KHOR is certainly wrong. 
>Winter: BGI C4 GIB +14 362
>Spherulitic: CEEEILN D3 E. +2 329
#note Championship Player says I'm drawing dead.
>Winter: ?AEMORU B2 ROAM +25 387
#note C4 GIBE would have blocked Winter's outbingo.
