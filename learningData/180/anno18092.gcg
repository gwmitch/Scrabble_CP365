#note I laid down B-O for BOVID, but changed my mind.  I considered VIDEO, but decided I like DI better than AB.  I was also under the very wrong impression that ABOVE doesn't take an S.

#note I saw OXALATE (but not the spot to play it until after I hit my clock) and I passed up OXALATES at N2.  I would have played 15I OXALATE had I noticed the spot.

#note Passing up the bingos.

>Tasha: ?ELMNTT N10 MET +25 241
#note I'm no longer deliberately passing up bingos at this point.  I just missed the spot for MANTLET and I downright missed MANTELET.  The hell is wrong with me?

#note I really REALLY didn't want to play this as worst-case scenario always applies with Scott.   I'm about to get burned.  
>Scott_Garner: NYZ 1L Z.NY +78 357
#note :(  This wouldn't be happening had I played MANTLET.
>Tasha: AEIOPTU 2J PIA.O +41 348
#note Well, at least I had a decent comeback.

>Tasha: CEEHIRT 5E CHERT +23 420
#note I laid down RETCH at first, but realized that RETCH gives back ORGAN.  I didn't see that Scott had a play just as good elsewhere, but CHERT sims best anyway. I don't really know WHY CHERT is better than RETCH if Scott still has SAGO but I played the RETCH sequence out and the best play is ORGAN instead of SAGO in that case.  Beats the hell out of me...
>Scott_Garner: AGNORS 12F SAGO +18 449
#note Best play for Scott.  I didn't see this but it doesn't matter because I had to block his  outplays on row 5.
