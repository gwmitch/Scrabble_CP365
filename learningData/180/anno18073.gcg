#note Q likes NEROLI which really scares me. The game could easily be all but over after NEROLI if opp has a bongo. Thought long and hard about IO or OI E4 because it opens the board in a way I really like but even with 19 points, I'm going to be fighting another terrible rack next turn. Q says my exch was second-best after NEROLI.
>Winter: BQSU 3C SQU.B +38 180
#note He did have a mouse and would have played something like NEROLIS / SUQ and sealed off the lower left quadrant in the process. Negative instance, I know.
>Spherulitic: EGGIKNU D1 GU.IN +34 137
#note Q likes KUNE or GUNK. GUQIN lets me make a play at 1A later, tho, which will score OK and open A column. That seems important on a board that's not very good.

#note Didn't see APT / THOWL. Q says it gives me 1/10 ish to win but that doesn't seem right. One play can block B & C cols and row 10 leaving only smth unlikely in row 13 or a very specific fit in M column. And oh the bing won't even win if he can score with the Z or smth.
