#note Off to a nice start.
>Mothra: CIOORRU K5 COU.OIR +36 36
>Geoff: BEEHIRT J10 HERB +32 112
#note Eh, brain cramp here. HEBE is clearly better than HERB in that spot - I saw HEBE, just spaced on it when it was time to commit the play. Though just BE (which I considered) sims a little better, despite scoring 10 fewer points. Hook I'd forgotten about: BERTHE#.
>Mothra: CEFINRS 6H INF.RCES +73 109
>Geoff: AAEIIOT O5 O.TIA +15 127
#note Sims best. Don't think I could really afford to leave the spot alone, though TIBIAE or BOATIE# would have cleaned up one more vowel.
>Mothra: EIJMQTV G7 J.VE +26 135
>Geoff: AEEILRX N9 EXILER +60 187
#note Ah, that's better.
>Mothra: AEIMQTZ M11 QAT +41 176
>Geoff: AAFMNNU F10 FANUM +37 224
#note Critical play, and I don't think this is quite right, though the top 3 plays all sim very close. I do get needlessly aggressive sometimes, and this is a good example - with both blanks and 3 esses unseen, it's too likely that FANUM is going to get hooked. FEM/MAUNNA# for 31 is better than either FANUM for 37 or FAUN F10 for 28, I think.
>Mothra: EIMNTWZ N2 WINZ. +45 221
>Geoff: AAADDNP 11C PAN.DA +34 258
#note Not the draw I wanted, but it cleans up nicely here. I'd better pick some goodies this time, though...
>Mothra: ?AEEIMT 15F sTEAMIE +87 308
#note And there it is. We'll be scrambling from behind now.
>Geoff: ADDIOPT M3 DIA.T +38 296
#note Not crazy about DOP as a leave here (though PLED or PEED are possible at O12 with the right draws), but 38 points is well worth it.
>Mothra: ?GINRST C7 STRi.ING +74 382
>Geoff: DDGHOPV O1 GOV +33 329
#note Ouch. Time to clean up the worst of this junk.
>Mothra: BEEKOOS 8A KE.O +27 409
>Geoff: DDHLPUU L12 DUP. +25 354
#note Didn't think of HUDDUP# at 5C, though I can't see that blocky a play making sense here. I didn't really consider exchanging, which simmed a bit better than what I did; at this score, it didn't seem like I could afford to take the zero. In any case, I'm under 2 percent to win now.

>Geoff: DEHLNOU A6 EL.HOUND +67 421
#note Won't be enough, but quite a nice pick from the bag there.
