>Emanuel: DENRY 8H NERDY +26 26
#note game 1 of a 19-game1-1 tourney to simulate the Las Vegas MSI even next month!
>Josh: ?ELNNOW 7G NOW +22 22
#note I looked agonizingly for 7s or 8s but I saw none. There were in fact none available. This is the best equity play and static play, and it sims best. But that doesn't make it right. Your approval makes it right!

>Josh: ?EELNNT --  -66 22
#note I've phonied with this before. I've probably also phonied with this while missing TUNNELED before too. This was one of those times. 
>Emanuel: ADEEILS 5F AEDILES +77 136
>Josh: ?EELNNT L2 TEN.EL. +20 42
#note And now LENiENT plays, how fantastic! I hope you are all approving of my plays!

>Josh: ?GINRST E8 RaTINGS +66 108
#note I looked very long on row 3 but yet couldn't spot S(O)RTi(E)ING! That seems better than 2A STRINGe(R), but maybe taking the 74 points is right here. I saw (WE)STeRING but was unsure. I played this so that the board would stay as open as possible so I can mount a comeback.
>Emanuel: AQ 2J QA. +32 195
>Josh: ADEFIUX 12D U.FIXED +52 160
#note Oh goodie 8A FIXU(RE)! I don't even remember that being valid, but I wonder if it's better than my play. I think it has got to be.
>Emanuel: AAHW 14B AWA.H +38 233
>Josh: AAIOTYZ 13A AZO +45 205
#note I held AWASH because it blocked a fantastic ZOY(S)IA, which forks a scoring spot and a bingo lane, but then again, if for some reason AWASH is invalid ZOYSIA would give Emanuel 43 points for HAW, so even if I doubt AWASH challenging wouldn't be amazing. I chose here between the 45-point AZO and the 41-point AZO at 15F. The good part about this one was that although it does leave Emanuel the possibility to score very well at 15A, it's less possible now than it would have been if I left the letters AWA untouched. But the good thing about the other AZO is that it opens a 7 lane, which I may need. But it's not necessary to be desperate nor is AITY going to bingo very often. Another good thing about 13A AZO is that if I draw a P or a U I can play down to the O and open up the board even further, which would be a good idea with my deficit. 
>Emanuel: EIMOTV 15F MOTIVE +40 273
>Josh: AACIPTY A8 PITAY. +45 250
#note Too bad there's no open L for ATYPICAL! The other 8s that I didn't see were CAPACITY and RAPACITY, the latter of which I didn't know. Held and released, followed by a murmur: "that's a nice phony"
>Emanuel: ILMST 3G M.TIL.S +39 312
#note both of us are scoring beautifully.
>Josh: AACEGLR 15A AGER +40 290
>Emanuel: OOT 11G TOO +16 328
>Josh: ACCELNR D4 CANCEL +27 317
#note CERCAL is available, as well as CARCEL. Both CERCAL/ and CARCEL are new to me, as well as CERCUS. ACELNR bingos a lot here so C(OX) rivals my play. B6 CLAN closes things down, not sure I want that, but it's simming well too cause of the strength of CER 
>Emanuel: DEINORU B2 DOURINE +74 402
#note Zooks!
>Josh: ?AFIORU 10I FAItOUR +69 386
#note 3B (O)F wins if I draw the S. I thought this won if I drew the I, but that's not even true. So I should play (O)F.
>Emanuel: BBHIKSV O7 SHI.K +36 438
#note L12 KHIS, but I don't challenge that.
