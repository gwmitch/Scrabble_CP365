>Kevin: EGN 8G NEG +8 8
>Geoff: BFJORSV 9H FORB +19 19
#note First I thought of JOB 7F 20, which is easily best, but I think what I didn't like was the closed board shape. Though with Kevin's small opener, he surely kept a bingo-ish leave...exchanging was a bit better than FORB (keep ORS simmed best). I probably overvalued JSV vs. FRSV here.
>Kevin: EEN K9 .EEN +12 20
>Geoff: AAIJSVY L6 JIVY +34 53
#note This or AJIVAS same spot for 44 was my debate. Shouldn't have been; given the leaves and limited value of the S on this board, I should have taken the points. 
>Kevin: CEENORT 12E CRETON.E +72 92
>Geoff: AAHIOQS 10F QIS +38 91
#note Let's keep two A's again. QIS seems like a must-play here, though I am not liking the board right now.
>Kevin: BDR 7J DR.B +10 102
>Geoff: AAEHILO 8L .IAL +25 116
#note Don't have to play the H at row 13 this time...I chose VIAL over VAIL wanting to keep the board more bingo-friendly, I remember. VIAL sims best, 1.5 over VAIL, details say it is a shade more bingo-conducive/offensive.
>Kevin: EFIRV 7D FIVER +22 124
#note Misscored as 17. How did neither of us catch that...
>Geoff: AAAEHOS 13H AHA +23 139
#note Ooh, didn't think of A(N)OA J11 for 8. Given that AHA and HAAF D4 have defensive issues of their own...I don't know, though. Could see it backfiring a little too often, though maybe I'm overworrying about it.
>Kevin: DIT 11K .DIT +8 132
#note Hmm. Bingo fish, I assume. No R (else DRI(F)T)...
>Geoff: ACEIOOS 10M OI +10 149
#note This game is hard. D4 COOF I thought hard about, but it seemed more restrictive than just leaving the left side be for now. OI at 6I might have been better than what I did. Sim winner was 14I OE 15 - neat jujitsu play there, didn't see it.
>Kevin: GILNT 14J GLINT +28 160
>Geoff: AACEORS D3 CARA.E +24 173
#note ROSACEA won't go. I'm being impatient here. Quackle probably thinks this is nuts, but let's see...eh, not that bad. E11 OCA is the obvious fishing-type play, and it wins. 8A ORCA 27 is second; CARAFE is close to it.
>Kevin: ADTX 8A TAX.D +42 202
>Geoff: ?GMNOSS 14B MOSSiNG +72 245
#note GNOMiS(T)S was the only other one.
>Kevin: ?EHKRTU 3B HU.KsTER +86 288
>Geoff: DLMNOPP H1 PO.M +33 278
#note Pool is hugely vowel-heavy from my side now, so I don't mind keeping consonants here so much. 2A POM 28 is actually simming a couple of points better. Not too many plays he could have at H1, true (though OYEZ would kill me), though he's more likely to block the spot than Quackle would so I'm not as likely to have the spot for myself next time. 
>Kevin: ILOO 13B OLIO +23 311
>Geoff: DELNPTY O13 PYE +34 312
#note Liked this better than B2 PHYLE, though maybe turning over another tile to get Z/S/good vowel would help. The two plays are about exactly tied in the sim. This may well come down to who gets the Z.
>Kevin: AAEEIUW 5C U.AEI +10 321
>Geoff: ADLNTUZ B8 .DZ +33 345
#note Oh wow, yeah, 2A NU setting up ADZ. I still have (A)DZ if he blocks it. That's 100 percent to win; my play is second at 86.
>Kevin: AOSUWW 6L .OW +26 347
#note This is where it gets weird, though we didn't notice. I was low on time and just assumed I'd mistracked; didn't have time to fix it. There were two E's missing from the set. Also, this was misscored as 24. 
>Geoff: ALNTU 2A TUN +18 363
#note This or O5 AL wins 100% (given the tiles we were playing with, it's possible some other plays do too)
>Kevin: ASUW O4 WAS +24 371
>Geoff: AEEL 13L LA +13 376
#note Best, given my actual rack of AL. Final score 378-364 (should have been 378-371).
