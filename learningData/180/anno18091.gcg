#note Quackle suggest GITS, but I don't like what that does to the board.

#note Phony.  I gave this a cursory glance and thought, "I don't know how to spell this word, but I think it has two I's."  I'm going to review the five vowel eight list as this is the second time this happened to me.  Anyways, I prefer to be 100% positive when challenging and so I didn't bother holding.  If I didn't suck, I would challenge this off and play ICTERUS next turn.

#note Omg, this play actually sims high (top play is the similar 6C DONGA).  I'm happy to see that this is a good play because it's actually a weird play for me.  This is good.  This means I'm shedding the old Tasha and being born anew! :D  I considered shorter plays on row three like GOA and ODE, but didn't like either of them.  I thought of 6D ODEA, but keeping GIN is not good on this board.  If I draw into a bingo, where would I play it?  I decided on DOING because it turns over five tiles with both blanks unseen and scores 33 points.  It's always good to know how to score against Scott.

#note Oops.  This is probably my biggest mistake of the game.  See what I was doing was I was setting up DAZE for next turn. What I SHOULD be doing is playing 11B WADE.  I'll possibly have a big Z play next turn with the right draw.

>Tasha: AINNSSU 13B NUS +21 314
#note I considered ANUS (sims best) and 2J SUNNA.  I played NUS because I have an A (and there's only 2 unseen) but I forgot that it also takes an O.
>Scott_Garner: ?EOWY A12 YOWE +46 383
#note But Scott didn't forget.  :(  After the game, he said he had the blank at this point.

#note I'm going to lose this game unless Scott miraculously has an ugly combo on his rack - like BFF or something.  
>Scott_Garner: ?EFIRTT O1 FRIsETT. +80 481
#note Because he was talking aloud to himself and shuffling his tiles, I knew an F must be in the bag and I'm definitely gonna lose.   :(  I wrote EEFIRTT? and I saw FRISETTE/FRIZETTE and an unplayable FETERITA.   I didn't see FRETTIER and probably would have challenged it.  Scott saw REFITTED, but wasn't 100% of it.  He saw FRISETTE and FRIZETTE but thought one spelling was good and the other wasn't and didn't know which.   At this point, I was hoping that he would perhaps chicken out, but he finally played FRISETTE because he was down to mere seconds and determined not to mess anything up.  After he played it, I told him that the word is good with both an S and a Z.  Back to my previous move: AGONIST.  I played this situation out by hand twice to see if it was right to bingo here (instead of fishing to bingo out) and I thought of fishing off the O at C11 leaving AGINST.  Both times I played this out I drew an A.  If Scott bingos with FRISETTE and I bingo out with AGAINST I lose by 39.  However, considering that Scott wasn't quite sure of FRISETTE/FRIZETTE, it's more likely he would have bingoed with FITTERS at 2A and I'll lose by much more than 39 because there's nothing for me on column O.
