#note Saw HEATEDLY but this is the type of play that makes an opponent want to throw up. Sims best.

#note 7 I's unseen, maybe (A)IDFUL to block the lanes and have a reasonable shot at GINZO for 75? FUNDI O1 is also a sharp play. Was a little miffed that FUZIL was blocked lol. Note the score after this play.

#note I've now become aware of the possibility of XI followed by KIF, which sets up an essentially unblockable S lane aside from a tiny 2 letter word beginning with E.

#note Jon played BINT super quickly, so he almost certainly left NT and not the Q. WAGE hits QUERIST in TWO spots for 100+ AND SQUIRTER for a HUUUUUUGE double-double! I'm looking at 1/4 to hit really, as Jon drew 3 of the last 4. The B for RUBIEST won't be fun to block either, as would STOURIE/SCUM.
