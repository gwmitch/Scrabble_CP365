#note It's close with exchanging. I had been exchanging on a lot of opening racks this tournament and I was a little tired of it.

#note Feeling snakebit on awkward draws, decided to keep the E. Otherwise, the options are ZEAL, GLAZER, BENZAL, all of which I considered. But felt like a no vowel draw would kill me. This is probably an error, and GLAZER is probably fine. Or ZEAL.

#note Tough position, but I think I have to blow up the rack. If I don't take the spot and Joel has an S or ? to take the spot, I'd finished. I'll take the 44, draw a blank, and have a shot at the lead with a bingo. I hope.

#note No idea whatsoever about this play. JURAT 12K? There's a 0% chance Joel doesn't shut down the O column immediately. And it just burns through the bag that much faster. Seriously had no idea here.

#note !
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABHJKRU F3 BURKA +23 368
#note Didn't have a lot of time to spend here, but this has gotta be the play, right? Block a lane and leave as few tiles in the bag as possible. Digging for the L in the bag is pretty important since I have no other way to block a 7M OI setup. So right there I'm losing 1/6. I'm guessing I can win all the other draws  with some sort of block for his setups. Drawing 5 is also nice so I can guarantee threatening JO or JETE if Joel tries to outrun instead of bingoing. Any ideas for alternatives to BURKA? Like I said, I was very low on time here.
