>Chris_Lipe: AEILX 8H AXILE +26 26
>Dave_Koenig: ?DEGORV K3 GROVE.eD +74 74
#note I didn't see 7D oVERDOG for five more points, but it's not that much better because of the dangerous 8D spot.
>Chris_Lipe: AEINN 7E INANE +19 45
>Dave_Koenig: IMMRSWY L10 IMMY +25 99
#note Right word, wrong spot.  I'm still not used to spotting the MNA# hook, which allows this to be played for 39 points at 6F.
>Chris_Lipe: EIIKN 4H KEI.IN +30 75

>Chris_Lipe: JLT C7 J.LT +20 95
>Dave_Koenig: AELSTTV I6 V..T +15 162
#note I missed another big play here: VALIDEST# through ID for 48 points.
>Chris_Lipe: OPU H1 POU. +30 125
>Dave_Koenig: AELSTUZ 5C LUTZES +41 203
#note I was happy to burn the S to score this well, protect my lead, and take out row 5 from him.  However, LUZ 6E is a stronger play that I missed.

>Chris_Lipe: ?AEEHPR A4 PREA.HEd +67 216
#note I'm not the only one who missed opportunities in this game.  Chris had PRESHAPE for 104.

>Chris_Lipe: EFIRY B10 FIERY +53 269
>Dave_Koenig: EEFGGRS 2M FEG +23 307
#note I wasn't sure about back hooks for SPORIDIA.  Here I was just playing my rack and the score as best I could, but it was a nice side benefit that I took out the O1 spot.  (L is the only back hook.)
>Chris_Lipe: BOO A13 OBO +24 293
>Dave_Koenig: CEGNRSS 11A ..SCERN +28 335
#note I missed the high scoring JOLTERS, but this also is a strong play, since I hold the last S to make a play to H15.
>Chris_Lipe: ADNU 3B DUAN +23 316
#note After the game, I mentioned to Chris that it would have been cool if he had the L here for ULNAD 3A.
