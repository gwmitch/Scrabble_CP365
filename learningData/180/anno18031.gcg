>Dad: AEW 7H WAE +24 24
>Siddharth_Murali: AEGHLNR 6G LARGE +34 62
#note This play is okay but GNARL destroys the sim, opp averages just 16 as opposed to 28+ after this, HARL/HERL, ARGLE, or RHEA.
>Dad: GIV K3 GIV. +16 40
>Siddharth_Murali: EHNNOUZ 2J ZONE +42 104
#note Spent a long time making sure to not miss anything worthwhile since this is horrible defensively... (G)UN for 8 is simming better! GUN is really awesome, as not only it shoots for ADRS for an 80 point play but it also safeguards the spot and makes him much less likely to block the spot with his own O, and even if if i don't draw ADRS then I can slap ZONE for 45 while hardly giving playback... creative!
>Dad: BDE N2 DEB +42 82
>Siddharth_Murali: HJNORSU M2 .H +20 124
#note ONRUSH is what I missed... this seems to be pretty good as I have an off-chance of bingoing in two juicy spots, but HEN's defense is prob stronger than this off-chance.

>Dad: AEMNT K10 MEANT +24 271
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEEFMW 4I WA.F +20 285
#note Close call, I'm really not sure how to judge whether this, FEU, MAFIA, or WAG, or WAE is best although I think I can rule out WAE because of the S hook, and eliminate WAG or MAFIA since opp avg. is 5 more than WAIF or FEU, so I think this is at worst second best and FEU is prob better because of the 4 points, and AEEM only averages 1 more than AAEMW for me next turn.
>Dad: ABEINTT J12 BAIT +19 290
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEIMOS 15G OMI. +18 303
#note Very happy with this choice over MAE or EMIT, as I'm using my scoring tile to score resulting in a bingo-or nothing leave, so I would rather open a line for a fighting chance, and given the pool i bingo a bit more with OMIT than EMIT.
>Dad: AET O12 TEA. +16 306
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEIINS G8 .IE +7 310
>Dad: EN F10 NE +8 314
>Siddharth_Murali: AEFINOS E10 OF +23 333
#note OAF bingos 7% more, which is surprising, I thought AEINS was more prone because of the shortage of vowels in the pool, the line OAF sets up is really the same as the line above OMIT, and this sets up SONE anyway, someone explain?
>Dad: CGILNOO D4 COOLING +77 391
>Siddharth_Murali: AEINPSS 14A SAPIENS +74 407
#note Chose rightly here, sure he can bingo out more but stuff like QUIPU after PANSIES can happen often anyway, and this limits Q plays to an extent given that no T's remain, if there were T's then PANSIES would be the obv choice I think... this wins 46%, PANSIES 39%
>Dad: DEILPUY C11 PUL.Y +24 415
#note DULI(A) and DUL(S)E win by 1!
>Siddharth_Murali: DIOQRUY 6B QU.D +34 441
>Dad: DEI 4B DI.E +7 422
>Dad:  (IORY) +14 436
#note Played decently, but lucked out enormously as I was still supposed to lose.
