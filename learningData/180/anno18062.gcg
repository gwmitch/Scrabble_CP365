#note Actual rack. OKEH looks good but maybe she liked the extra lane.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABCGNST 14C BANG +23 303
#note This is probably an overreaction, and really my first mistake, i should just probably take the points with STANG and not really infer that strong of a rack... -7

#note Really hardly any errors to be found, and I could  have still lost had she found OARLIKE. BANG might be a slight overreaction, but that was only 5 points back on equity, and if that's my main error, then I really need to just focus on tuning in and staying really sharp every game like I did this one.
