#note Maybe keeping EHN is a touch better.  HUE doesn't impress me much.
>Brett: ?BDGORY 8G BOGY +20 20
>Dave: EEFMNNT 9F FEN +14 14
#note BOGYMEN is cute, but not quite as good as this.
>Brett: ?ADIRRW J6 WR. +17 37
#note Missing a magical bingo.
>Dave: EEIMNNT 10H EMINENT +66 80
#note This wasn't hard to find, since Polatnick had opened with it against me the previous round.
>Brett: ?ADHIOR 11B HAIRDOs +73 110
#note see if you can find the 10.  Good luck.  I shouldn't have feared the S in the triple lane so much and taken the 80 points, especially because the position I took isn't exactly defensive.
>Dave: AEILOUW B9 AW.ILE +40 120
>Brett: DEFHNOS A6 FOHN +32 142
#note shedding the N probably wasn't best (especially with only 2 unseen).  HA set's up my D, E and S whereas NA only sets up my E.  Also if I draw one of the many A's or I's I'm looking pretty good.
>Dave: AIOORUV 5J AVO +22 142
>Brett: ADEEIKS A12 KADI +58 200
#note LAKESIDE is easy to miss here, especially when your eyes are locked onto a 58 point play, but Brett's comment about the bingo being volatile is sheer nonsense.
>Dave: ?IIORTU 6A .RUITIOn +64 206
>Brett: AAEENRS 10E AE +15 215
#note dammit.  didn't even really look for the two through the T.
>Dave: AEINSTU E5 U. +4 210
>Brett: AEENRSX M8 AN.EXERS +82 297
#note "HOLD!!!" I said.  I always remember that one of INDEX and ANNEX takes RE- and -ER but the other only RE-.  Actually, this exact one has come up in games before.  I probably would have thought about it longer and challenged it off, if I didn't have this comeback.
>Dave: ACEINST 15H CINEA.TS +149 359
>Brett: CEEILSZ L8 ZE. +45 342
#note pretty straight forward.
>Dave: EGLMSTU 8L ..GS +42 401
#note I was *very* tempted to play MUG, but I'm glad I didn't.
>Brett: ACEILSV 4A VESICAL +87 429
>Dave: ELMORTU O1 MOULTER. +83 484
#note could have really done without this.  I was in the game until this really.
>Brett: BDGILOP L12 OP +30 459
#note after simming Champion's plays: GOB(S)=14, GO(O)P=14, C9 GO(A)D=27,3B BOP=26, 3B DIB=23, L2 GOB(O)=14, and C1 GIB(S)=14 are all "better".  I see now what is so bad about OP.  Closing down the E lane makes it way too easy for him to shut down the board.   With two good lanes already open, I really don't think GOBS is necessary, but def better than OP.  I guess I just wanted to play short, hold my IL in case I draw the J (JILL) or Q (QI) but hope he draws the Q without the U and needs to play for 11.  That's a lot to hope for, but I thought it better than throwing things open for no points and giving the game away.  Any thoughts?
>Dave: EOPQTTU L4 P.T +10 494
#note I thought I was in great shape to win here, but the one thing that could mess me up was JILL 4L.  This move temporizes just right for the endgame while holding good scoring plays QUEER, USQUE and QUA.  There is one downside to holding the Q here, which is that I could draw the J, as in fact I did.
>Brett: BDGILRY D10 G.RLY +22 481
#note with my draw things are pretty bleak, but BY might be better for 31.  I just wanted to play off tiles and hope I could go out in 2 with him holding the J and Q and only being able to play off 1.  I drew the D to my BID and that is that.  RIG(I)DLY scores 30 and plays long too, but I didn't see it.
>Dave: AEJOQTU F2 QU. +32 526
#note I saw that USQUE would give me outs in two places, but with the case A this looked like such a strong setup.  I scanned the board carefully but missed his out play.
>Brett: BDDI D1 BID. +10 491
#note Oh man.  fuck.  I had an out I missed that would have given me the win.  ugh.  Dave was hoping I would block with BI and set-up his JABOT.
