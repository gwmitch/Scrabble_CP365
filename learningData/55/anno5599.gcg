>Jim_Burlant: AEFLNOR 8H OF +10 10
#note This was not an autopilot opening rack, and I spent a minute or so debating whether to go long or short.  Quackle prefers 8D FLORA 24, with this choice coming in third.  And I suspect that, if I were playing a 1700 or 1800 level opponent I would have gone with FLOREA.  Against this opponent I took a different tack and was rewarded for it.
>Pam_Stubblefield: BCEI 9E BICE +13 13
#note If  Pam had opted for the much more defensive BI 7H, this game might have turned into a slog...but this play gave me just what I needed to start the fireworks.
>Jim_Burlant: AELNORT F4 RELAT.ON +62 72
#note Quackle gives slight preference to ORIENTAL F7.
>Pam_Stubblefield: AGY E3 GAY +26 39
>Jim_Burlant: AEEPTUW D4 WEEP +36 108
#note AWEE D3 wins the sim by a hair. 
>Pam_Stubblefield: IIKST 12B TIKIS +27 66
>Jim_Burlant: ALMNSTU B10 MU.ANT +28 136
#note Quackle prefers 8A LUMS or 8A MUNS, both scoring 32.  While the leave is better with those choices, I still prefer turning this rack.  I thought the S was worth more than 4 points given the hook at 10H.
>Pam_Stubblefield: AHOX A8 HOAX +55 121
#note Ouch.
>Jim_Burlant: AFILSUW J6 AWFUL +24 160
#note Best, at 66% winning chances
>Pam_Stubblefield: EO A14 OE +14 135
>Jim_Burlant: CDIIOST K10 ODIC +16 176
#note I take a mild hit for this choice, with the sim winner being ADIT 13B 24.  I was too fixated on unloading the O to look anywhere other than K10 plays.  Incorrectly scored as 14.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EEEOSY O1 O.E +9 348
#note Arrrrrgh.  Shame on me for not recognizing EYESOrE.   Even compared to the non-bingo options, this is a bit weak.  TYEE 4K would have been a much better choice given that I'm sitting on the case S and one of the blanks.  
>Pam_Stubblefield: DN 13A D.N +16 243
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEERSY 4K .YE +12 360
#note I'm sitting on the second-to-last E,  I have the S and the blank - why not open another line to guarantee a bingo?

>Jim_Burlant: BGJLUVZ 6A LUG. +7 441
#note This is where I pay for missing EYESOrE...by drawing a rack that is quite an eyesore!  While I got SANtERO down to seal the win, I think it's safe to say that, if I found EYESOrE 2 turns back, I probably woiuld have landed most, if not all of these scorers because of all the turnover.  And if I landed them 2 turns ago I would have had time to unload them.  Even if I only dumped them for chump change, I'd have still gotten between 30 - 40 points for them AND not  given her 36 points points back for those tiles at the end of the game.  Conservatively, that's a 70-point swing.  Anyway, saw this and went into brain lock, taking several minutes to even find this.  I realized my error right after I hit my clock.  JUBE 6A should have been my play, of course. I thought I might catch a break if she couldn't go out...but no such luck.  Good thing for me this game wasn't closer, or this could have killed it for me.
