#note this is the most dangerous spot to me, but duck likes playing jo giving me some bingo chances for next turn. I dunno, I just feel like given my word knowledge i'm going to score more on average with ajs than with aerss. I'm almost guaranteed 38 for ja(r)s/(neutral)s so this is my play.

#note no matter how hard i tried, I could not understand this play. I assume he missed vi(men), but this can't possibly be right, can it? This seems like the type of play someone would make if they don't take their opponent seriously.
