>Jim_Burlant: BCINSWX -BCW +0 0
#note Quackle prefers tossing the X and keeping the C.  
>Bonnie_Redland: AFINT 8D FAINT +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: EINORSX D8 .OXIER +32 32
#note Quackle prefers 7F XI 22.   I would have fished if I could have played off OX without either giving up too many points, obstructing the S hook, and/or taking out the T in FAINT.  I felt that if the T in FAINT got blocked and I didn't draw another one,  ENORS could lead to more problems for me than it was worth, given my limited word knowledge.  Scoring 32, drawing 5 to SN with SSS??JQZ still unseen isn't that bad, is it?
>Bonnie_Redland: CO 10B CO. +18 42
>Jim_Burlant: EHNSSST 9C H.NS +24 56
#note Quackle's preference is HOTNESS C9, which I didn't see.
>Bonnie_Redland: BEMRT 11C T.MBER +26 68
>Jim_Burlant: AEMRSST I2 STREAMS +72 128
#note Urp.  H1 SMARTEST is obviously better.  Bad miss.
>Bonnie_Redland: AEIKRVY -AEIKRV +0 68
>Jim_Burlant: EELNPTY H11 .EPLY +33 161
#note Best, at 86% winning chances.
>Bonnie_Redland: ADO 4I .OAD +10 78
>Jim_Burlant: DEEJNRT K3 J.DE +24 185
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  5H JEED for 8 more points is much better, and it's the sim winner.  But, as was often the case this tournament, I wound up benefitting from my mistake.
>Bonnie_Redland: GO 3K .OG +25 103
>Jim_Burlant: EIINNRT L6 TINNIER +68 253
#note If I'd made the right play on the previous turn, I'd be sitting on a no-go, as the 7 wouldn't play and the only 8's in TINNIER are TRIENNIA (which would have been blocked by JEED) and INVERTIN (both V's still unseen).   Better to be lucky than good, I guess.
>Bonnie_Redland: ?ADELTU N3 sALUTED +70 173
#note I think it's safe to say that, with this being game 4 and neither of us having had lunch yet, the morning coffee had worn off and neither Bonnie nor I were hitting on all cylinders.  Just as I missed SMARTEST for 83 when I played STREAMS, she missed ADULTErY on row 15 for 86.  Possibly a game changer, but probably not, given that I wound up with the last S (luckbox!).
>Jim_Burlant: EGOPQVZ 2F ZEP. +35 288
#note While I don't think this is a bad play (92% winning chances according to Quackle), the sim says GLOZE 14G is best - looks about right.  Points are identical but GLOZE does a better job clearing out the rack.  And if she hits something big down the O column I still have a much easier chance of coming back on row 2; in that scenario, ZEPS limits me to the less lucrative lines on rows 5, 6, 14,  or 15.  And, defensively, ZEPS is still susceptible to something like THORIAS or GLORIAS 3A.
>Bonnie_Redland: KOW K11 WOK +32 205
>Jim_Burlant: EGIOQUV 13A QUI.E +28 316
#note Quackle prefers 14G GLOVE 28, keeping QUI.  I guess it doesn't like potential comeback plays at A11 or A12, and it prefers to not burn QU.  I don't agree here.  I'd rather unload the Q, though I concede that GOV is no blessing as far as leaves go.  My feeling was that, since this put me up by over 110 points, the worst-case 54-point FIQUE would still leave me with a healthy lead.  I'm still at 94% winning chances with this play.
>Bonnie_Redland: GV B12 V.G +14 219
>Jim_Burlant: GNNOTVY O8 TONY +30 346
#note Best, ostensibly with 99% winning chances.  Is that percentage really right, given that there's a blank still unseen and a nice bingo line on row 5 she can still hit?
>Bonnie_Redland: AB J6 BA +26 245
>Jim_Burlant: AGIINSV 3C VINA +25 371
#note 2B VIGIA wins the sim. I preferred not to open any lines for potential 8's by playing VIGIA at 2B - not with the blank unseen, anyway.
>Bonnie_Redland: AFLUW N11 AWFUL +27 272
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIOOS 15A AGIO +27 398
#note Quackle prefers 14E SOILAGE, emptying the bag, which I didn't see. This play simmed second.  Had I seen SOILAGE I still would have passed it up, not wanting to empty the bag if I absolutely didn't have to.
>Bonnie_Redland: CHII 15K CHI.I +42 314
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEORS 5E EROD. +12 410
#note This was the end of the 4th game of the morning session, and I think it's safe to say (as if some of my other mistakes this game didn't make this obvious already) that I was hungry, probably tiring, and as a result I was making poor decisions.   I must not have tracked this correctly because I was convinced, with a blank still at large, that she could still possibly bingo on row 5.  If I had bothered to look across the table I would have seen that she only had 5 and played DOSE 4D 30.  But I wasn't alert enough to do that.
