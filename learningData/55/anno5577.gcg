>Mason_Schambach: EHTW 8F WHET +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: ?DHIPST J5 DIPSHiT +75 75
#note Wasn't sure this was good but elected to put it down figuring that, since I had the blank, if I lost the turn I'd still bingo shortly.  Turns out it's good, and guffaws all over as this came down.
>Mason_Schambach: CELNO K3 CLONE +26 46
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNNTY 11G GEN.LY +20 95
#note Better at L7 for 8 more points.  But look how I'm rewarded for my mistake on the next turn.
>Mason_Schambach: ERTX H11 .XERT +60 106
>Jim_Burlant: AGINSTU 13B UNITAG.S +74 169
>Mason_Schambach: ABK 12D KAB +36 142
>Jim_Burlant: EFINOSZ F8 .IZ +35 204
#note Sims within 2 points of F6 ZOWIE, the best choice.  
>Mason_Schambach: MO 14F MO. +27 169
>Jim_Burlant: EFNORST 12L OF +20 224
#note Spent a couple of minutes on this turn specifically looking for an open E for SOFTENER and still somehow managed to miss the open E at H8.   This choice is the best non-bingo option.
>Mason_Schambach: ABG 13L BAG +30 199
>Jim_Burlant: CENRSTT 6F CRET.. +14 238
#note This wasn't good - should have just fished off the C and T at B12.
>Mason_Schambach: V E11 V.. +12 211
#note Scored as 14.
>Jim_Burlant: DEINSTU O7 DUNITES +84 322
#note Better to be lucky than good.  My reward for the suboptimal play of the previous two turns is to draw into an easy bingo.   Quackle says I'm now at 94  - 95%  winning chances with this play, even with a blank unseen.
>Mason_Schambach: EP N10 PE +22 233
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIIOW 3I AE.IA +16 338
#note Given the size of my lead and that the bag is under 30, my strategy was to force the issue with turnover, with the aim of emptying the bag as quickly as possible,  I didn't see I10 ANISE, which is the best play.  I don't take much of a hit here and I'm still well over 90% winning chances here.
>Mason_Schambach: FIN N6 FIN +19 252
>Jim_Burlant: IILORSW 4F LIRI +7 345
#note Didn't see the star plays in this position (WIPE and WIPER 7H)  but once again,I was just looking to turn as much of the rack as possible.  To show how cruel this game can be, this play - which really wasn't that defensive, and frankly was quite weak, blocked the bingo, OVERRUN, he was going to put down on the next turn.  Sometimes it's just better to be lucky than good.
>Mason_Schambach: ENORRUV B8 OVERR.N +24 276
>Jim_Burlant: EOOSUWY A6 YOW +42 387
#note Best.  YOWES scores 9 more but this play wins the sim despite giving up valuation.
>Mason_Schambach: AA A14 AA +8 284
>Jim_Burlant: AELOQSU B2 QUALE +39 426
#note Quackle prefers 5D QUA which I think is absurd - why would I open up a line for easy 7's with A? still unseen?  I like this better, as it takes the bag down to 1.
>Mason_Schambach: DMU 4A M.UD +20 304
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIJOOS 14J JESt +40 466
#note And thus completeth the bagging.
