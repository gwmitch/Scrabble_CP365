>Scott_McDougall: EHU 8F HUE +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: BCGIJNS G7 J.G +21 21
#note I thought he might be trying to set something up here.  This is best.
>Scott_McDougall: GO 7G .OG +15 27
>Jim_Burlant: BBCILNS -BBC +0 21
#note I didn't like the thought of using my S this relatively cheap on this turn, so I opted to exchange.  Quackle prefers 10G SIBB 26, or J7 SIBB 26.
>Scott_McDougall: AEFRY 10F FAERY +39 66
>Jim_Burlant: ACILNNS 11J ANIL +13 34
#note 1st choice is H10 ENCINA, which I didn't know.  This choice takes a pounding in the sim, though outside of ENCINA none of the options are particularly good.  I figured I'd turn 4 tiles, open a line, and see what happened.
>Scott_McDougall: EINV 11C VINE +19 85
>Jim_Burlant: ACELNRS L7 LANC.ERS +72 106
#note Chose this because every time I put down LANCIERS, it gets held.   Sure enough, Scott held me, but released.  I didn't get the chance to ask him afterwards what his reasoning was for releasing.  Sim prefers J1 LANCERS by a hair.
>Scott_McDougall: HMOTU B10 MOUTH +40 125
>Jim_Burlant: DIIIOPT 8K P.TIO +21 127
#note Reluctantly made this play because I couldn't find an I dump that didn't give up too many points.  Look how I'm rewarded on the next turn. (14J POSIT wins the sim btw).
>Scott_McDougall: AEFOV A6 FOVEA +37 162
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIMNS O7 D.MINIES +62 189
#note The only playable bingo.
>Scott_McDougall: UX A12 XU +36 198
>Jim_Burlant: ?EKNOTW N13 WOK +29 218
#note Ouch - this is pathetic.  Didn't occur to me there were bingos in this rack.  NETWORK!  WONKIEST!  
>Scott_McDougall: IQ 14J QI. +32 230
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEENTY B5 YE +14 232
#note This is very weak - way too much of a fish.  I definitely should have taken out 15A with something like TYE,  EYE, or AYE, and I realized this right after I hit the clock.  But look how I'm rewarded on the next turn.
>Scott_McDougall: AGOT 6E GOAT +23 253
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENSTW 4A WANTErS +82 314
#note In what is becoming a familiar mantra, better to be lucky than good.
>Scott_McDougall: ?CELORT J1 LECTORs +73 326
>Jim_Burlant: ABDIPRU 15E UPBRAID +100 414
#note How to find a compound word:  I initially saw PADI 15G.  Then I saw PAID 15H for 3 more points but wasn't thrilled with the RUB leave.  Saw BRAID leaving UP.  Braid leaving "up"...UPBRAID!   Scott had played a very good game and was understandably shocked when this came down.   I'm now at 91% winning chances; of the other choices, only 1G BURLAP sims above 50%.	
>Scott_McDougall: DITZ C6 DITZ +32 358
>Jim_Burlant: AABEELN 1F ENAB.E +24 438
#note Didn't know any of the other row 1 choices.
>Scott_McDougall: DEIORRS 12D DORSIER +88 446
>Scott_McDougall: DEIORRS --  -88 358
#note I was surprised when this came down, but what else could Scott do if he wanted to win the game?  Given that this was his out play, there was no question about whether or not to challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AL 2F LA +10 448
#note I felt badly for Scott - he had done a terrific job manufacturing one high-scoring play after another, only to have to lose to me drawing into so many bingos that they more than compensated for play that was, at times, dreadful.  I told him after the game that he had really played a strong game.   This game was much much closer than the final score.
