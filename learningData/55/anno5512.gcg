>Lou: DPU H7 PUD +12 12
>Dave: ANNNNOT G6 NONA +17 17
#note Despite the two N leave this has got to be better than trading, because it leaves a pretty low scoring board for the opponent.  Perhaps ANON is slightly better as it leaves the board less S friendly and doesn't give the Z spot at I9.
>Lou: II -II +0 12

>Lou: ADEILNS 10H SNAILED +71 83
>Dave: EHLNPST F9 PHT +22 53
#note Totally didn't think about TOPH.  Oops.
>Lou: AEUV L8 VA.UE +24 107
>Dave: DEFLNSW M9 W.NDS +40 93
#note I was so caught up on this play that I didn't even consider FLAW or FLAWED on row 9.  Although they have the virture of keeping the S, this play is much stronger defensively.
>Lou: AEGM E4 MEGA +28 135
>Dave: EEFJLOS D1 JEFE +52 145
>Lou: ABNO 1A BAN.O +42 177
>Dave: IILOSXZ 2A OX +40 185
#note The points are far too good to worry about the two I leave here, even with six more remaining.  Plus, I'm hoping to draw a T for BANJOIST.
>Lou: EEILRY E10 EERILY +27 204
>Dave: IILMRSZ 15A SLIM. +39 224
#note This play really needs to be made, but it was painful to break up the chances for BANJOIST and MIRZA K9.
>Lou: BET D11 BET +21 225
>Dave: IIIORRZ B11 ZORI. +28 252
#note I thought about the cute BORZOI, but this is clearly better.
>Lou: HOY C4 HOY +17 242
>Dave: FIIIRRU -IIRRFU +0 252
#note Trading a lot of tiles is called for with both blanks unseen, and the two more R's remaining don't make holding onto one that worthwhile.  But I kept an I just to hope for BANJOIST again, which could be a difference maker.
>Lou: ??CGIRS J7 CRe.SInG +63 305
#note Interesting.  Lou could use one blank for BANJOIST here, but it's not clear that it would be a good choice.  With an already blocked up board and holding CG on his rack, bingoing on the next turn or ever again in this game would be no sure thing, especially if I play on the K column.  He has other bingos that score a bit more, but this one seems to keep the board very tight.
>Dave: AAEEITT B5 TAE +14 266
#note I was feeling pretty desperate considering that the N column looks like my only spot to bingo, and he might block it at any moment.  I considered taking an exta point with TEA or ETA at 7A, but I thought that might be too reckless.  This play also has the advantage of creating a distraction on the A column, but one which is not as likely to be so high scoring as to put me away.  Still, my chances are grim, especially now that the possibility of BANJOIST has disappeared.
>Lou: LOTU A6 LOUT +20 325
>Dave: ACEIIRT C10 AI +18 284
#note Just dropping the I might seem like a good fish, but I didn't see anything I could draw that would actually fit.  Still, there's another place I could have played that hadn't occurred to me quite yet.
>Lou: EFGOR N5 FORGE. +19 344
#note This seems a bit reckless, though losing should still be unlikely.  A bingo by me isn't necessarily going to win, so maybe something like GONERS 13H.  If he knew that I couldn't have QUOD, GED would also be a good choice.
>Dave: ACEIRTV O1 CRAVE +47 331
>Lou: ADIKQUW 6L QU.D +26 370
#note Lou was down to just a few seconds.  Missing my out was understandable, but any play that blocks it wins easily.  Even if he doesn't but finds his high scoring play of QUAD I12 he still wins.
>Dave: IIORT I3 TORII +18 349
>Dave:  (AIKW) +22 371
#note The start of a very fortunate day.
