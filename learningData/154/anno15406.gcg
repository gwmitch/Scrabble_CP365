#note Quackle likes V(E)R(Y), which I considered, but I didn't want to play through ORRTW. 20 points plus whatever I score next turn is probably not as good as 0 + next turn. If it were 25+, maybe I would have played it.

#note Championship player says play (E)FF at H11...but my logic was that I'll take my points on this closed board to keep up. Had I see (S)UQ I probably would have played that. Unlike the other games this tournament, I actually spent a lot of time on this turn/game, also. Had there not been an unseen blank and U, I may have reconsidered.

#note In hindsight, I played pretty bad this game, but drawing the blank at the end allowed me to make a nice endgame set up. Key mistakes looking back we (J)O and maybe CUFFE(D).
