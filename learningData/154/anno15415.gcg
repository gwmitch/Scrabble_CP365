#note 7I HA sims best by 2-3 points. I don't like that fish at all, CG isn't good.

#note OTTA(V)A sims best. I like my play, I have an S while there is only one remaining early in the game, and it opens things up for me with my bingo-prone tiles. I stand by it.

#note I passed up IVOrIES to block this of course, Quackle says I should still play the bingo. If the bingo scored more and/or didn't open up a 3x3, I may have thought differently.

#note MAU(V)E sims slightly better (less than 0.5). I considered it, but the bingo lane that it opens beats any available lane that is currently on the board, which is partly why I played somewhere that didn't block anything. I was also fine with my play because there are significantly more consonants than vowels in the pool, so my leave doesn't concern me. I'll take the 28 points.
