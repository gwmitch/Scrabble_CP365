#note Quackle prefers VOLT(S) but I'll take my points. Neither play helps the board really, also keeping the K on this board isn't really doing much. Obviously LTV isn't great but 24 vs 16 is enough to sway me one way over the other.

#note Championship player says play V(A)C 13G...I'd have to get a pretty good comeback draw though to make that worth playing. My play puts me down 40, if I fish I'm gonna gave to bingo. With no blanks out still, I'll play through it.
