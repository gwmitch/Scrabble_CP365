>freak_by_ovens: AAELMNO 8D AMOLE +16 16
#note there's a word called MELANO# but i'm not playing that at 8d. had i seen it, ALAMO in the same spot would've worked out better.
>chic_navy_lens: EKOPY 7D POKEY +37 37
#note if that's pokey, then where's gumby? <hides in obvious embarrassment>
>freak_by_ovens: ACHINTX 9H XANTHIC +84 100
#note thank heavens for collins.
>chic_navy_lens: AAU 8J AUA +14 51
>freak_by_ovens: ADEENNN 10J DEAN +28 128
#note take the points. leave the consonants.
>chic_navy_lens: AHN 7L HAN +17 68
#note looks like someone's going in solo. (ok, i'll stop now. at least for this turn.)
>freak_by_ovens: ABEENNW N1 BAWNEE. +28 156
#note quacklin' is torn between e4 ENWOMB (26) and this play. here, i'll break the tie and kill the hook he obviously set up.
>chic_navy_lens: EEILRRS I1 RELIERS +75 143
#note (scored as 74) game on, folks.
>freak_by_ovens: FLNORTU J2 FONT +34 190
#note the lovely e5 DWS-DWS ROOMFUL (48) is available. so is the one at 5e (FORLENT# for 40) and the nice multiple-hook m2 FOUTRA# (39). at least i'm cutting down a bunch of reasonable bingo options.
>chic_navy_lens: GIOV 1E VIGO. +27 170
>freak_by_ovens: DILLRTU O1 ID +24 214
#note this is simply awful. i mean, what could you possibly expect to do next turn with this remaining collection of crap? 2f DIREFUL (27) is all sorts of awesome. d7 PALLID (18) and even m9 INDULT (14) are better overall.
>chic_navy_lens: CEIRT D7 ..RETIC +22 192
>freak_by_ovens: ?ALLRTU 14B LUsTRAL +77 291
#note that was quite the miracle draw. was happy to see the I for the sub-60 bingos. almost wet myself when i noticed this higher scoring option. (fine, i didn't get *that* excited. after all, i had to convince myself that either word involved in my play was legit.)
>chic_navy_lens: ?DIIORZ 15G IODIZeR +106 298
#note with three Ss unseen and your opponent picking seven fresh tiles, would you move it over for the extra 28 points? evans first laid it down for 134 but settled on the lower figure.
>freak_by_ovens: EGINOPT 4H P..GO +22 313
#note phew. although once again, my board vision failed since m2 POET (32) didn't register anywhere on my radar.
>chic_navy_lens: AOSVW N11 AVOWS +39 337
#note ah, yes, there's an S.
>freak_by_ovens: EEGINTY O4 YENTE +56 369
#note this definitely saved my ass, despite the constant nagging. although i'm not out of the woods yet...
>chic_navy_lens: BFU 13K BUF. +18 355
#note this play is unbelievably good. so good that it needs to be mentioned for best strategic play...if that prize is still being offered. (can't figure out why it's great? wait a bit and you'll understand.)
>freak_by_ovens: EGIOQST 15A QIS +40 409
#note notice anything i may have missed? oh, dear lord, i'm a moron. and i can't claim time pressure, as i had at least 10 minutes left. guess i should just be happy he didn't have the Q.
>chic_navy_lens: EIJMRSU 3L JE. +35 390
>freak_by_ovens: DEGOT 12J DOG +20 429
#note still oblivious to that high scoring area, so i'm still shedding like an autumn tree. but i think i'm good from here on in.
>chic_navy_lens: IMRSU 11C S.RUM +14 404
>freak_by_ovens: ET 13F ET +9 438
#note the b10 play scores three more. silly normal TWL hooks.
>freak_by_ovens:  (I) +2 440
