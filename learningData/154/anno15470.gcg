#note At least these plays that I'm agonizing over aren't totally awful.

#note J1 SUDSED keeping a blank is pretty cool.

>Thomas_Reinke: ?AAEIMS K1 MAlAISE +81 211
#note I didn't consider the open A. ANAEMIAS is an easy find and clearly the right play.

#note That A hurts me again. ACQUIREE.

#note This gives back potentially huge plays making BERTHA, but who cares? 46 points is 46 points.

#note On second thought, nah, let's block that spot.
>Joel_Sherman: DEW N2 WED +31 324
>Thomas_Reinke: ANNORST 1M NOR +17 359
#note I took a long time here. I figured he was setting up another place for QAT and wanted to block in case he missed. I didn't consider that he could have QUA as well as QAT in the other corner. Still, this isn't a horrible play.
>Joel_Sherman: AQU A1 QUA +42 366
>Thomas_Reinke: ALNNSTT N7 SLANT +15 374
#note Not the draw I wanted. This was the only way I could see to get a possible out in 2. TAN or ANT can be blocked, but then UNTAXED seals the game. I thought this was the winning play, but I didn't see the response of O9 NEIF, which is his only winning response.
