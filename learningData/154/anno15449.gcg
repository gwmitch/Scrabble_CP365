>Joshua_Sokol: CHLTTW -WTL +0 0
#note This is the club tournament final game against Michael. He has to beat me by 148 to win. Keeping CH is apparently better than keeping TCH. 
>Michael_Fagen: ?AACDEI 8B AECIDiA +74 74
#note Great... ACEDIAS seems best here.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEHLSTY 7A THY +27 27
#note CHESTY means proud. Had I known that I would have played it. Also, LECYTHIS, which I didn't know, and CHASTELY, which upon seeing it I would have gone with. Bleh...
>Michael_Fagen: EIOPRR A1 PRERIO. +30 104
>Joshua_Sokol: CEFLNOS E5 FOL.C +20 47
#note I wasn't sure of FLOC here... :( A few plays look better than this. This isn't too too bad. Other options are (HA)LF, OF 9F (I really didn't want to play that), and FON 9A.
>Michael_Fagen: AEGHNTZ 9A NTH +29 133
#note There are a few plays that look better than this.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEINQSU D3 QUIN +33 80
#note I considered SQUIB. This looks fine.
>Michael_Fagen: AEGIRRZ 9H GRAZIER +72 205
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEGSSY -  +0 80
#note I insta-challenged this. I had never ever ever seen GRAZY, let alone GRAZIER. Big mistake. I didn't know it was a noun either, but that fact doesn't change much after the next two turns.
>Michael_Fagen: EEEIKOU K9 .OUK +34 239
#note Only good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEGSSY 8L BYES +50 130
#note Well, nevermind. I should have deduced that it was a noun and played GYBES O5
>Michael_Fagen: EEEGIVW 10J W.G +34 273
#note It may be better here to block the spot WOG blocks, but I think he needs to play as volatilely as possible here, so 6A (O)W looks better.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGLSUX B2 EX +31 161
#note Wow, I missed 7E (L)EX... I guess the blank I messed me up... Well at least this gives me 10 more points if I play a (P)L or (P)R bingo up top...
>Michael_Fagen: EEEIOUV 12H EVO.E +26 299
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGLSU 13B BELUGAS +74 235
#note Cool. I'm less worried now.
>Michael_Fagen: DEIMTUV 14A VIM +28 327
#note Michael is playing pretty well here! 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEIOPS O1 ADIPOSE. +92 327
#note Nice draw for me. It's now pretty close to impossible for him to beat me by 148.
>Michael_Fagen: DDENRTU M12 DUD +24 351
#note This is totally the right play here considering the necessary volatility required to win by 148.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ILMNNT F6 MI. +25 352
#note I considered playing MeLT L15 here to protect spread, but I did not deem it worthwhile, due to other hotspots that were still on the board. Turns out it may have been correct. Other options are (L)IMN 7E which I missed and NIM N1, but I preferred leaving the board more open and scoring a bit more.
>Michael_Fagen: AEJNNRT 15L JEAN +63 414
#note Ouch.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALNNTT E12 L.NT +4 356
#note What to do here? I should not have played L(U)NT, for sure, to keep the (P)L possibility open at A1. Maybe I go for points here with (P)LANT... I wasn't even thinking about how to win. Just how to not lose by 148, which is getting less possible every turn.
>Michael_Fagen: AFINORT N1 FIT +25 439
#note He can't really win by enough now, so nothing changes the outcome here. I would play FANTO(D) for the best chance of 148-point victory, in the off chance that I have LNRSTTW and he bingoes next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEINT 6H rATANIE. +61 417
#note Now I should be trying to win, therefore bingoing is not the correct option. I can't lose by 148 unless I empty the bag. The best play is almost certainly (AG)EN(ES)IA, which I should have seen, as I was searching for 11s in that spot. Sim says it wins around 30% of the time, which is much better than 2%, which is what I get from bingoing.
>Michael_Fagen: AENOORW B6 W... +31 470
#note Apparently (N)OW is the best play for him.
>Joshua_Sokol: LORST K2 TORS.L +12 429
>Joshua_Sokol: LORST --  -12 417
#note Worst play of the game? lol, this should be good. Pertaining to the TORSO.
>Michael_Fagen: AENOOR 15D A.ONER +21 491
#note Bleh. Well I won the tournament...
>Joshua_Sokol: LORST 1A .LOTS +18 435
#note Missed SL(U)T and SL(U)R13K again.
>Michael_Fagen: O F13 .O. +10 501
>Michael_Fagen:  (R) +2 503
