#note Missed D(I)ZEN, which Quackle likes way better than my play, but there are 4 S's and a blank out, so maybe it's fine to pass it up anyway. (-4)

#note I passed up BOVID here because I had to take the L4 spot just in case she had to Q. I know, it's paranoid, but I can't afford a 45+ point play. Also, only 1 unseen ), so I don't have to worry about her playing in the 5 row so much. But BOVID is right, nonetheless. She probably doesn't have the Q based on her last play, and I really shouldn't have kept VM. (-11)
