#note Setting up the b as well.
>Ed_de_Guzman: EI L6 .I.E +13 282
>Adam_Ginzberg: ABCEORZ 2B CRAZE +55 400
#note How do you solve a problem like that dangling s. Both blanks out, although i dont think there are a ton of triple triples with an s in that position. Right idea with craze, but croze is obviously better. No legitimate way to block the triple triple. Holding the b for 10N seems apt especially after going up nearly 120.

#note That's unfortunate.
>Adam_Ginzberg: BCFGIOT N10 BIGOT +41 441
#note After my draw to BO my win chances are down dramatically. My only hope is if the blank is in the bag.
