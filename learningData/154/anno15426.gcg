#note Looking back, weren't your actions thus, you POS?
>Geoff: AABEMOS F5 ABOMA +27 135
#note ffs I really gaffed here. I really would have loved 3 A's here, ABOMASA came to mind here. Perhaps karma is just around the corner..

#note Okay... =D
>Sam: EEELRTV L5 LEVERET +78 285
>Sam: EEELRTV --  -78 207
#note This is where he gets himself into shit. He tries this play, which I held for quite some time actually, but eventually I challenge off the phony EQUIPT*, though EQUIPE# is good.
>Geoff: ?HIOSUY 10J HUI +31 315
#note I took a while on this play. Ultimately, I came to play HUI, and champ likes it too. I didn't want to play HOY or anything because I liked the Y for J14. (SINFUL)LY is still possible too. I definitely like this play though.
>Sam: EEELRTV E7 LEVERET +88 295
>Sam: EEELRTV --  -88 207
#note Frankly, I think LAN looks more plausible than EMAS. But A) I'm up 108 points B) You just played a phoney elsewhere and had it challenged off and C) don't you think if that WERE good, I'd have noticed that to be your only bingo spot since I KNOW your tiles and done something to block it? Dumbass.
>Geoff: ?AANOSY 14H NAY +34 349
#note I passed up on YAqONAS# here, which in hindsight might be worth doing. I really wanted to milk him for all the spread points I could. So I really liked NAY for 34, I've got the case S and blank and A good draw could score big points on lane 15. I didn't think of YOjANAS#...
>Sam: EEELRTV 11E RE..... +36 243
#note Well finally he makes a play he should have done 6 turns ago. Conglaturations.

#note SADDO: pl. DOS or DOES someone, especially a man, who is not fashionable or interesting or has no friends; a person perceived as contemptible or pathetically inadequate; Sam Kantimathi.

>Sam: CENT E2 CENT +16 355
#note I thought this play was weird. Trying for some miracle bingo? I honestly did not know.
>Geoff: AADILTT 15K A.IAL +36 566
#note Champ prefers AT 14E. Fishy little bastard.
