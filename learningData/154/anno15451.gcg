#note In a vacuum ex. U looks pretty good, but I always give plays like that a signiciant minus against humans. It outsims this by a couple points.

#note I spent WAY too much time here debating the optimal 67-69 point bingo. As it turns out, 10A sims best.

#note Wow, 11D VIM ekes this in a sim. I would never play that.

#note Drawing into QUITE/QUOTE almost every time. BUT psychotic Quackle suggests something totally different: 6A EVE. Whoa. I dunno, it seems like that gets blocked most of the time, and then I am left with very little if I miss QUITE/QUOTE. It's not that I'm drawing into huge plays on row 14-15 very often. But EVE is the massive sim winner by over 7 points here. I guess EVENT gives back a dangerous line. Crazy

#note Wheels start to fall off. There's not really any reason to shed both consonants. That could cost me. Something like 13G GOO or M12 EGO is fine. This might be hindsight talking.

#note Quackle's not a fan. I'm supposed to do L1 CERIA and draw into a Z miracle. Maybe David drew AIIOORR or something
