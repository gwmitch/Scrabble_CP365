#note Missed FRETTY. I played this over DOTTY because they seemed close and I thought this had a chance of getting a challenge, because I thought DORTIER was good in Collins (it is), and Komol had shown some confusion.

#note I probably have to play BOVID here, unfortunately. I only saw it just after I hit my clock. It really is a shitty play to have to make but the 20 points seem worth it. At this point I started to get really frustrated about the game. I stopped focusing on making the best play and instead focused too much on how lucky Komol was getting. Luckily I didn't have to make too many hard plays this game, but this is always a bad attitude to have.

#note Eventually I just excepted that I probably wasn't going to make a good play here. This is what I thought of after a bit of strategic thinking mixed with annoyance. After this play I started focusing not on what to play but instead on my attitude and trying to get back into the "make the best play" mindset. Looking at the other available plays, I actually think I like this play anyway, but it seems like there could be better possiblities with a rack like this -- just so many options to consider.

#note There is an awesome bingo here! I think Komol actually saw it and chickened out of it. (We talked about it after the game.)
