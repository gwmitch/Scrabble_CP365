>jd: DEGRVXZ 8G VEG +14 14
#note I was already 3 games off the lead by this point and not feeling that great, but I had to settle in and relax and focus.

this is a tricky little play. it would not occur to me to slot VEG or VEX at 8H, but doing so allows for some really big snapbacks next turn.

#note yeah, I flat out missed dextrin here. I blame gambling until late at night at harrah's. dextrin sure is a major upgrade.

>jd: EIINRUX J2 XI +36 83
#note I passed up nixie but it actually sims a little better than this. I figured I would be closer to a bingo this way.

#note I was hoping to block to block the easiest bingo lane with this play. however, a much better way of being defensive here would be FUB which is really nice. I don't think I had time to fin dit.
