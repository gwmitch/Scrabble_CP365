>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EGIIOSS 8G OI +4 4
#note I have a pretty rock-solid rule of thumb to never open with a two-vowel two. I don't know why I chose to violate that here. I guess this just didn't seem like an exchange rack. Anyways, Ex. GIO, OI, and Ex. GIIO sim close.
>Anita_Rackham: BDEL 7G BLED +20 20
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEGIISS 9D SIEGE +19 23
#note This gives too much back. I think I just didn't see 9G SEI.
>Anita_Rackham: AEGIMRT D2 RAGTIME. +74 94
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIOSUWY 8A YOW. +30 53

>Anita_Rackham: ACHNT 1E NATCH +32 146
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEFINQS -  +0 75
#note Ugh... that's brutal. Of course it's an everyday word, but I just swore I didn't remember ever seeing it in study. Yuck.
>Anita_Rackham: DFI 10H DIF +20 166
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEFINQS 11I FEND +26 101
#note Same word at K10, I guess? Stupid me, I wanted to set up QIS, but of course K10 FEND does that too.
>Anita_Rackham: AAW B4 AWA +16 182
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEIIQSU L8 QAI.S +50 151
#note I don't know. Am I not losing by enough to try something like this? Too early for creativity. Just do EQUIDS.
>Anita_Rackham: AEINPTU M3 PETUNIA +86 268
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIMNSUY L2 YUM +28 179
#note Ugh. Open your eyes. Two squares down, duh!

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ??EORRT 12C sORTERs +67 331
#note Looked for more points but didn't see 12D TORREFY. Limited how much time was worth spending on this.
>Anita_Rackham: KOO H12 .OOK +24 343
#note Anita has ~17 minutes left to my ~4 and she is blitzing me.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BLNPRUZ C1 P.B +22 353
#note Quackle isn't crazy about this. It actually likes 14G BOURN. I dunno. I was running low on time and my main plan here was to draw the right vowel to get a big Z play. Turning over two tiles is the wrong way to go about it though.
>Anita_Rackham: LOX M13 LOX +31 374
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ELNRUVZ 14E VEL.UR +13 366
#note Plan here was to draw an I to threaten outs in two places, or an A for the nice scores. Although I4 ZINE wasn't likely to be enough. It doesn't look like this wins ever, but does anything?
>Anita_Rackham: EIIRSTV A3 IT +6 380
#note Anita can win by ignoring my Z and playing N5 IT to threaten a big out with GIVERS backup.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ANZ F6 ZA +39 405
>Anita_Rackham: EIRSV 13B VISE +24 404
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: N E1 ..N +8 413
#note Questionable play by me and weird luck to win it, but I'll take it.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (R) +2 415
