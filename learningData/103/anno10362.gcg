>Matt: ?ACEGRT 9B CiGARET +68 68
>Kevin: EKNOS K4 KENOS +26 40
>Matt: ADEIIIR L2 IRID +25 93
#note Risky creating the V hot spot, plus saving 3 vowels.  Just didn't want to play through 2 I's next rack.  Performs slightly worse than AIDE?R L3 and INIA 6J in the sim.
>Kevin: ADQS 2J QA.DS +70 110
#note That's another good reason not to do IRID I suppose.
>Matt: AAEEIRW 7G AWE +24 117
>Kevin: EGP E8 G.PE +14 124
>Matt: AAEILRR 1M AIR +14 131
#note RAI 3H is one more and makes the board more open, something that should benefit me.  
>Kevin: EMNOORT C6 MOT.ONER +70 194
>Matt: AAEILRV 5D REAVAIL.. +76 207
#note So much for VELARIA 12A.  Happy to have this as backup, since REAVAIL and LAVALIER were much riskier.
>Kevin: AEGP 4A PAGE +24 218
>Matt: ABENNSX D11 EX +39 246
#note 1 A vs. 3 E's unseen, hence EX over AX.  Quackle agrees, but AXMEN 6A is another interesting choice that runs equal to EX.
>Kevin: IOTV A4 .IVOT +30 248
#note AXMEN makes that spot harder to hit.
>Matt: ABLNNSZ 4H ZA +44 290
#note Best, but the pool is starting to look pretty bad.
>Kevin: DNO B12 DON +21 269
>Matt: BCLNNOS A13 NOB +20 310
#note I was all set to play COLZA for 48, not believing my luck, but then he played DON and I got scared a bingo was immenent, coming down row 15.  If I sim against E?, COLZA still wins, this is 2nd, back 8 points..  I thought I could draw an O later and hit COLZA then.  
>Kevin: ABOT B2 BO.T +14 283
>Matt: CIIILNS F2 INI. +6 316
#note Holding onto CL for COLZA still.  Quackle hates my play, suggesting ILIAC for 15 in the same spot.
>Kevin: CHI B7 HI. +17 300
#note It was around here I noticed not a single U had been played. Concerning since I don't have this game locked up.  
>Matt: CEFIJLS -FJ +0 316
#note Wow, this sims best, but I've suddenly become an underdog in this game.  Now I'm hoping for a bingo at 10H or an O for COLZA.
>Kevin: MTU D1 MUT.. +10 310
#note He seems content not to open the board either.  
>Matt: CEHILOS H1 COL.. +48 364
#note Lucky me.  
>Kevin: DEU F11 DUE +9 319
#note Now he has no choice but to open.
>Matt: EFHIJSW 13E J.W +17 381
#note Yeah, I drew FJW to HIES.  Sadly JEWFISH is homeless as a bingo.  I wanted to leave 1 or 2  in the bag and obstruct his bingo chances.  Quackle likes JEFE, but I felt that gave him too many easy chances at a 7.  
>Kevin: ?ESUY 11C ....Y +9 328
#note I forget his exact rack, but I know when he showed it to me his bingo was SYNURAE 10H.  Probably UNEASY?.  It loses if he bingoes now though, since I have HAFFETS or HAFFITS for 40 as a comeback.  
>Matt: EFFHIST 14F TEFFS +27 408
#note Well, mine is the worst of the 3 wins.  There's LEFTISH for 29 which wins by 4 after he bingoes with URINAtES, and ELS/CiGARETS, which prevents him from bingoing at all.   I tried to come up with all AENRSU? bingoes possible, saw that TEFFS would squeak by, and played it.  Wish I'd thought of ELS, since it so effectively shuts down his responses.
>Kevin: ?AENRSU 10H SURNAmE +67 395
#note No recount, as he was satisfied with the result. 
>Kevin:  (HIU) +12 407
