#note oh no, whelkier is a word! I've absolutely never seen that word. that would've made a huge difference - jump from 40 to 90% win percentage. this is the advantage of knowing those low-prob bingoes.

#note this gives up too many easy points. I have no great choices but this gives back a lot of points without really threatening anything. GID at C2 actually gives me a 20% chance of bingoing, which I sorely need.

#note I have some winning chances but this is not the way to maximize having the blank - taking the points for AHEAD is pretty good (I could draw BEFLEAED!) but the winner is ELF at C2 which is clever. I was running low on time but I sure wish I had seen AHEAD. she will probably make some kind of defensive play, but maybe I get to fish for a play on column H if she does block. I think ELF is overrated but I do like it as a play.
>Leesa: EEMNORZ C1 MEZE +33 384
#note I did not draw very well. she should play at F2 and leave two outs (enorm morn and roman)
