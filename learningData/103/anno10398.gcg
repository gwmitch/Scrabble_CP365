#note I didn't see EXPENDER 13B, which suits a bingo-prone leave nicely while Dave is pulling six random tiles. I did consider HORRENT and HORNET C1, but I was perhaps overcautious not to break up a strong rack. EXPENDER is the play I was looking for but didn't find.

#note I should have dropped the R as well and played DREW 2A. I don't like LEW 2B here with the front A-hooks unseen.

>Lucas_Freeman: DEGINRT K1 DIG +15 308
#note With junk in the bag (QU looked useless on this board. I didn't want it), it never occurred to me to play more than three tiles here. But DIRGE 13I is a nice point grab. DIG leads to a bingo more often, but probably not often enough for the point differential. Dave isn't going to bingo, and DIRGE puts me at even odds. DIG actually worked out, though.
