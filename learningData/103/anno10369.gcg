#note this is a big rack. I would think SIZER might be better because of the fritzes spot. I don't know if I totally understand the sim results that say ritzes is better. I guess sizer does give up 2x2s and such. I would probably play sizer had I thought of it.

#note tihs game is pretty even. I could really stand to see one of my better plays here (OLIO for more points or the cool spot for ORIOLE at M4). actually though, I do like that this play takes out the easiest lane on the board...I'd rather make her have to do something more complicated to win.

#note catenoid would be a litle more defensive but I figured working on my spread wasn't a terrible idea.

#note just exchanging leaves more lanes open and leaves me with a better leave anyway.

#note I lucked out here that she didn't know talesmen....or see misrelate!
>jd: AAGGMNU 12F GAGMA. +12 491
#note now that I know the Q is in the bag I should be able to play perfectly...although quackle doesn't factor in the fact that she will almost certainly miss talesmen (not to mention misrelate). actually I like the look of gunman in case she doesn't see quag out, but really playing QI at N6 is perfectly fine.
