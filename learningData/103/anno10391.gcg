#note quackle thinks this play sux. the top simming plays ae AI at 11F, PACIEST at 13H or AECIA at 11B. All of those are very  unintuitive to me. the real problem is that there are a ton of vowels unseen so PIA doesn't hit bingos very much. I guess paciest is ok.

#note a lot of plays sim very close, but as far as I see it the only real options are exchanging or playing this. I can see VEG at N2 having some worth but the leave looks too disaster-prone. all in all I don't like quackle's suggestion of SEE at F12 at all.

#note good timing for him, time for me to bail out of this rack and hope he doesn't score too much.

>jd: CEOQUUW C12 QUO. +28 258
#note holding onto the q is tempting but no play really leads to me scoring that much in future.

#note WOW is preferred at L10. without much happening on this board, keeping a spot to score with the C next turn is a good idea.

#note well, he had to try something. without inferences quackle wants me to play something like JEU, but quackle is out of its mind.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?AEELNS F7 pLA.. +17 290
#note this play is totally ridiculous but he absolutely has to do this!! kinda awesome when your best choice is far and away burning a blank for 17 with 12 tiles left in the bag. he only had one blank too.
>jd: EIJRTTU G6 TI +5 333
#note this is another one of those times when quackle sims don't mean anything unless you use them intelligently. quackle is playing the positions after TI wrong. the only real number that matters is the bingo percentage. as far as scoring plays go the only ones that TI gives him are SEXUAL, XENIAL, EXEDRA or EXUVIA. those get him almost level but all give me J plays to score and pull ahead. Long story short, I don't lose this game after TI, as the sim results show if you pu it on many. I considered JUPE because it makes it hard for him to fish again next turn but bingoes like RETINUES fit.

>Sam_Kantimathi: ?EENNSU D7 o.EN +20 329
#note ridiculously enough his best play is No at H5 for 2 to block my out! I end up almost getting U stuck if he does that, but it sure is hard to see.
