#note I was a little down and frustrated at lunch about being 7-5 and many games out of first. now I just needed to focus.FFF

this play sims wayyyy worse than I imagined. ghi which I totally didn't consider does everything better - more defensive, bingos more, scores more now even.

#note he had some stuff here - I swear I've absolutely never seen TRISTFUL before. I figured I would know it and I needed it to come off the board pretty bad.

>jd: ABIKOQS 4C QI +26 277
#note I thought QIS looked a little dangerous, but there aren't that many Is and he's not going to score quite that much there in general. the sim evens out between qi and qis. I figured keeping votives/bosk in reserve wouldn't hurt.

#note goddamnit, I definitely thought about outbakes, and it totally looks familiar, but somewhere along the way I decided it was too ridiculous to actually be a word. duh. this is a large mistake.

the board is probably a little too open for this play either - he's probably going to hit a bingo sooner or later, and there will be lots of lanes when he does. quackle prefers koi.

#note it seems like he would've done better playing 1 or 2 tiles - this really takes the pressure off.
