>Eric: NNOO 8F NOON +8 8
>Matt: EFLNRTY F6 FE.NY +27 27
>Eric: ?ACCDEU J4 ACCUsED +75 83
#note Man, it seems he does this to me every game.  
>Matt: ILOORTY K9 ROOTILY +75 102
#note Phony, but I felt I needed to try something before falling into a hole against him.  Eric is very apt at running away with games early.  Scored as 83 (doubled the Y inadvertently). OLITORY#.
>Eric: EI 5I I.E +10 93
#note Geez, he's close again, or so it seemed to me at the time.
>Matt: BEGRSTT 7C BEG.T +15 117
#note I justified this move by his fish, thinking he didn't have high point tiles.  However, BEGOT dumps the same ltters for 1 more point and is much safer.  BEG is even better; the ERSTT leave is pretty potent.
>Eric: EFIN 8A NEIF +46 139
#note Yep, I deserved that.
>Matt: AKNRRST 15G NARK. +36 153
#note The S isn't great on this board, so it's OK to burn it for 48 (RANKS/NARKS H1).  If I'm aiming for defense, KNARRY is better.
>Eric: EILOPT H1 POLITE +33 172
#note TICE#.  Didn't think to hold until after he drew tiles.  It's one I've played myself in a TWL game and got away with.  I think I was relieved he blew up his rack more than anything.
>Matt: LRST 13J T.RL +8 161
#note Miscopied my rack, but I think I only had 1 vowel and a duplicate R.
>Eric: AWX G2 WAX +31 203
>Matt: ADNORSZ 14F ZONA +39 200
#note Vision fail. 9A ADZ 52 is best by a mile.
>Eric: AEIITTU A6 UI.TAITE +59 262
#note And ADZ blocks that from happening.  
>Matt: DEERSSV N10 VERSED +41 241
#note The duck agrees with burning the D.
>Eric: EH O14 HE +29 291
>Matt: AABJSSS L2 JABS +33 274
#note Took a calculated gamble he wasn't going to challenge off his own phony, and it paid off.  I am tempted to petition for ASSJABS* to be added to Collins after this rack.
>Eric: DG 3K G.D +10 301
#note I'm guessing he has the other blank now.
>Matt: AGIIOSS 2L .IG +25 299
#note Didn't want to open the 3x3 with JIAO.  With the 2 S's on hand, I was going for a set up and banking he wouldn't use the blank there on this turn.
>Eric: ?DELQRU 13A .L +2 303
#note He told me his rack here, the curious play was an attempt to draw into sQUIRED or sQUARED O2.  He also debated dumping the D or R and going for LIQUEFIED/LIQUEFIER, which would have been sick.
>Matt: AAIORSS O1 OSAR +27 326
#note Straightforward, score 27 and block the best bingo lane.
>Eric: ?DEEQRU C12 ED +14 317
#note I think he drew the last E here.  Quackle likes QUiTE or QUaTE for 51.  He's not likely to score more with the blank on this board.
>Matt: AAIMOSV B4 VIM +24 350
#note I thought this spot had to go, incase he was aiming for QUORUM or QURSH.  The riskier spot is still 12H, so the Champ Player recomends VITA 12I, but this is 2nd
>Eric: ?EPQRUW 11C PEW +22 339
#note I think he mentioend he missed 12H as a spot for the Q.  Of note: PRE(ACCUsED) 24.
>Matt: AAHIMOS 10C AHO. +27 377
#note This is 3rd, after AMAH 10A (followed by AVISO, and he can't block without giving up on the Q) and AERO 9I, which sets up HAMS or HIMS for 48 next turn.   
>Eric: ?QRUU D13 sUQ +25 364
>Matt: AIMS N4 AIMS +14 391
#note Scored as 13.  Final score recorded as 402-364.  This put me within striking distance of 1st place going into the final round, but he squashed me by 200.
>Matt:  (RU) +4 395
