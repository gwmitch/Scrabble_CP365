#note Marilyn is awesome. it was cool to get to play her here. I played almost entirely women through round 12 which is also cool.

pretty much a crapshoot betwen this and pareo. I would rather exchange and see how they react if I'm not sure between two plays like this.

#note I swear this would never occur to me as a rack to phony with, except the word WEAPONER* was literally on the board next to us in the game between leesa and joel sherman, and I was hoping that marilyn would have noticed. unfortunately for me, she hadn't, and the rest of the game went downhill from here.

marilyn's reaction when I explained to her what the hell I was doing was to say "you bad boy."

#note it wouldn't be a bad idea to play weapon and leave her with less information about my rack.

>jd: ABGNOTU 11I BAG +26 204
#note ack, in collins I would have gunboat for a lot. instead it doesn't fit and I have to do this. I played BAG instead of GAB because I figured it would allow for more bingos in the long run.

#note why wouldn't I just take 16 points here? I am confused. I think I maybe should've played VIA anyway. quackle is not great for playing through this kind of position.

>jd: AEEINST H12 ..E +3 227
#note with the As unseen as well this is probably a dumb play. maybe vie?

>jd: AEINOST H1 .OE +6 233
#note really I should've played here two turns ago. quackle is not really helpful because it makes dumb plays.

#note I looked for a long time and this was the best I could come up with. actually though playing RED at 3G does 1 better.

#note oh no! believe it or not this is a 78 point mistake - I should play off everything else and then play the B there to go out.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: Z -  +0 479
#note fortunately for me she made a huge error of her own

#note at 7-5 with alright spread things weren't looking so hot. moreover the losses had a lot to do with me making silly mistakes. I'm worried that I complained at lunch. I just felt tired.
