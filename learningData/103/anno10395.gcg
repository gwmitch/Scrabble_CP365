#note starting to look like a very defensive game - given that my rack is so clunky I think that's a good thing for now
>Noah: ?ABDENP 7C BAP +25 59
#note Looked for something through OX, but could find uNBOXED, which may be best since bingo potential isn't looking super high on this board. On the other hand, if I don't get a bingo I'll often have the opportunity to play (POX)ED next turn, which might make BAP worthwhile.

jd: I would play unboxed
>Jesse: EFJORRR 10B FOR +20 58
#note quackle likes joe, which surprises me because of how awful the leave is. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up exchanging next turn. the leave of for seems to offer much more potential.

#note ooh, I totally didn't notice that noah had opened the hook for AFORE by playing poxed. In that class I might play JAW at A9 not give up easy plays on column A - although JAW at A9 would make for some very powerful extensions to keep track of.
>Noah: ?FNNNRT -FNNN +0 118
>Jesse: ?EENRSU 11E .ENtURES +66 171
#note I could also play jeers and not bingo this turn, which may be worth it because of how easy it is to score on column A. I don't bingo that much next turn after jeers though.

#note Maybe a different fish? JO has merit. He definitely didn't have an S last turn, so there's still some hope in RIGS. I should give my best fish, playing OUR or YOU.

#note jd: blocking the rig hook just in time...
>Jesse: AEINOST O4 TISANE +30 277
#note  noah: Crazy play, but it's not too bad at all here!

jd: this play doesn't sim so hot until you start throwing in some inferences. I put him on an S when he played RIG and he must still have it. JEU suggests a pretty strong leave that he blew up because the K crippled it. What TISANE does is that it foces him to bingo through the tough lane on column M, from the G on row 14 or occasionally finding a way to hook a bingo on column N). It also takes out potential big scoring plays that his S might allow him on column O with the many high-point tiles remaining. In spite of all this sweet-talking this is a satine rack I'm blowing up - but there are a lot of land mines in the bag which I'm not going to get to bingo with.

long story short I don't know if this is right but I'm satisfied with the logic that went into it.

#note how ironic that I would actually read brian williams' latest babiest bingo update and then miss aroynted, number 1 expertest bingo. oops. I'm not even sure I looked over there.
>Noah: ABILSSV N10 BASIL +31 281
#note Continuing to make setups for my S.
>Jesse: AAELORZ 14J ZOEA. +34 342
#note noah: Foiled thrice!

jd: I had to stare at this rack for awhile before I could find anything I felt that great about. with the Q lurking I wanted to try to preserve a Q play while also trying to block QIS or VISE on row 15. I lose one endgame, and that's when I pull QI out of the bag, in which case he gets to play VENENOSE (the same bingo I missed in the last round of new orleans)! Ironically I hadn't finished looking over all my new orleans games yet. At least VENENOSE didn't cost me a game either team.
