#note I always, always, always, always count the tiles and check under the board and surrounding area before starting a tournament game. But the tiles were already bagged and for whatever reason, I was feeling lazy, and we agreed to not bother counting. So, Murphy's Law, this set was missing a T. Blugh.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEFINNR 6B REDFIN +16 62
#note I hated the direction this game was taking. All of the options here were bad or set up her S. So I blew it open. Quackle actually approves.
>Lydia_Keras: OX 5E OX +37 100
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEENRTW C2 ATWE.N +20 82
#note That S inference was talking me out of a lot of good plays. But (D)EWATER is obvious and I dunno how I missed it.
>Lydia_Keras: AHO B2 HAO +29 129
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEEIRUV M9 U.C.RVE +26 108
#note Whoa, I was like 100% sure this was good. Maybe I was thinking of DECURVE? Which is incidentally the play I should have made... at D6. Another silly miss.

#note 150 points through 9 turns... I was ready to make a move. This seemed like a good time to phony.

#note Keeping my T's for a TWEE play.
>Lydia_Keras: EY A4 YE +23 299
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: INOSTTU A1 UT +16 272
#note Blugh. Missed the obvious TINFOILS. That puts us on even ground going into a potential bingo-exchange.
>Lydia_Keras: CI 13B IC. +10 309
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GINOPST A8 POSTING +89 361
#note I couldn't find a smart way to try and get the out-bingo. I figured my best chance was that she somehow didn't have all of ??S.
>Lydia_Keras: ??EIISU M1 UtIlISE +67 376
>Lydia_Keras:  (DNPT) +14 390
#note The T was later found on the floor. Real score was 388-361.
