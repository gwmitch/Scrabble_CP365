#note I2 RIDLEYS really doesn't give that much back. It might be worth the extra 2 points, but it's a wash.

#note Eh... the top-simming play is 4A HEAVE? That seems really weak. I guess K8 EIDE should have been worth considering. I think I was too nervous relying on the barely-a-consonant letter H acting as my only consonant in a vowel-heavy leave. If... that makes any sense....

#note Couldnt choose between this or C5 NAH for the defense. I figured the board was already open, so why not make it more open? I wish my logic actually made sense, but this play is probably fine.

#note Somehow I missed the words up top: ODEON and ODEA. I like ODEA for sure.

#note Hmm... should I be playing short here? 7F FA sims as well as this play. I guess the CLAMPS bingo lane is hard to kill, but it is still only one lane. Of course, FA does more than fish, but I was paranoid about leaving that B column open.

#note F7 WAX is the top simming play. Makes sense. It's a point more, and it leaves open a critical scoring spot for me. STEY is 35 there, why block it? It's a good backup plan if I miss my bingo. This is a pretty big error.
