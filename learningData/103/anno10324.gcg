#note I very nearly played LOITdRER here, having written down that blank on my sheet as an E. That would have been embarrassing.

#note It was a nice lead while it lasted....
>Stefan_Rau: EGGGIIW 6H GIG +15 148
#note Oh, come on.....all three Gs? Cripes. No really great options here, but for what it's worth, this wins the sim. Choices are so crummy that H1 WIRE comes in fourth, IGGG leave notwithstanding.

#note Had I known the last three tiles in the bag were BEU, I might've considered fishing for a 164-point BEZIQUES. But probably not very seriously.
