>Stefan_Rau: AGNRSSU D4 NU.GRASS +70 144
#note This is about how the draws go whenever I play Jason....he's totally due for about three 600 games against me, with how lucky I've been in the past. Will today be the day to reverse the trend? 
>Jason_Ubeika: DEFOOT C9 FOOTED +41 60
>Stefan_Rau: AAIIINV 2E AVI.IN +20 164
#note Aaaarrrgh....totally whiffed on 7B VI(G)IA. That's much better than this. 
>Jason_Ubeika: ADEIMRR 1I MARRIED +89 149
>Stefan_Rau: AEEIOPU 4H .IAOU +14 178
#note Quackle prefers 14B A(D)IEU by a tiny bit. I don't think I agree. 
>Jason_Ubeika: LTV K3 V.LT +14 163

>Jason_Ubeika: CELNRST J7 L.CTERNS +64 227
>Stefan_Rau: AIJOQUU 14F QUAI. +34 301
#note Fortunately, plenty of reasonable options for this scary-looking rack....but, really, Quackle? You like 13G QUI(N)OA better than this? Um, no thanks. 
>Jason_Ubeika: HITWY 1A WITHY +59 286
#note Oh. That is many points. 
>Stefan_Rau: ABJOSUZ 7M ZA +45 346
#note I was feeling pretty confident after this draw....take 45 now, setting up a 52-point J play next turn. 
>Jason_Ubeika: ?CGILRY 11F GLYC.RIn +76 362
#note Oh, crap.

#note See, this is where I would usually stupidly bungle the game away by cashing in the S-spot too soon with S(O)PH or something, then facepalming as he underlaps QUAI for 40-odd. I completely whiffed on the 45-point PHT in this spot (I *always* forget that word), but this actually has a much better winning chance (81% vs. 60%). The only play Quackle says wins 100% of the time, though, was in a third spot that I didn't even consider: B10 SHAPEN for 49. 
>Jason_Ubeika: ADEEILN B11 NIDE +24 456
#note Jason has one win here, that neither of us saw at the time: N10 DE(BO)NE for 40, followed by the tricky-to-see outplay of 7F IL(I)A(L) for 19. 
>Stefan_Rau: APSTW O12 S.AP +31 487
#note 14M SAW is three points better. 
>Jason_Ubeika: AEL C1 .ALE +10 466
>Jason_Ubeika:  (TW) +10 476
#note This earned Jason twenty bucks for high loss, not surprisingly.
