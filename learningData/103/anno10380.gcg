#note meh? I couldn't figure out what to do with this rack. KOP sims even. sure does make the board complicated with all the potential extensions.

#note there's gotta be a case for blocking the extension but this seems worthwhile.

#note it seemed like it was time to take away the extension here. setting myself up in the process is good too. quackle likes ROMS, but you gotta figure she might have been saving up to hit one of the skimp extensions.

#note this gives up a lot of equity to block. a play like DUSTY or STUDY gets the game over faster and retains the X to score with.

#note I knew when I made this play that I had dados in reserve. however, there's probably a good case for playing dados now - she's not that likely to bingo, and I may end up drawing some tiles that allow me to score more than 14. however, the tempo is bad because it may allow her to win with an out-in-two depending on what tiles I end up with. they are quite close on a 4-ply sim (dados is ahead on 2-ply, but the 4-ply may reveal the long term issues with playing dados).

#note things i considered: V(IN)O L11 to draw FIREBUG to go out, VIG to block plays in O and hopefully go out next turn, ORBY 11E. i just went for the play with the most points at the end. VIG wins the sim.

#note I took forever to make this play because I was suddenly worried it might just be dadoes. dadoes is in fact good. dodos would have solved my problem too.

#note I definitely got the better end of the luck in this game.
