>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFIMTY 9G AMITY +25 25
#note Relieved to see I didn't miss anything here.  Hate keeping F? but it's not terrible.  Two left scores 1 more, but opens the 3WS.
>Liz_Gottlin: BDEINTT 10E BIT +9 23
#note 10B BITTED 20?
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAEEFL E5 FAcEA.LE +98 123
#note Well, if I'm drawing like that, F? is fine!  Also: FLEA(B)AnE for 74.
>Liz_Gottlin: ADEMNRT F4 DAM +27 50
>Ryan_Fischer: IIJNOOP 7J JOIN +22 145
#note G8 J(AT)O 26 has a really weak leave.  Hard to say.  I'm fine with mine.
>Liz_Gottlin: EGINRRT 8A RING.R +27 77
#note 10I RE 24, leaving the potent GINRT and an E wide open.
>Ryan_Fischer: DGINOPV 12A PONG.D +26 171
#note PONDI(N)G for 28?  I missed VOGI(E) for 26.  Can't see how.  Weird.  The IV leave on PONGED isn't great, but at least...
>Liz_Gottlin: AAAEPST -  +0 77
#note I get the challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIINNOV 8L NEVI +29 200
>Liz_Gottlin: AAAEPST 10I TEA +30 107
#note And at this point, I've blocked A(N)APAEST in two spots.  Eric Harshbarger played that on me as a 3x3 a few years ago in Atlanta.  (P)APA will bingo fastest, I'm pretty sure.
>Ryan_Fischer: DDINOOS A12 .OOD +21 221
>Liz_Gottlin: AAEEHPS 11J SHAPE +50 157
#note Pretty: C3 SAPHE(N)AE 80.  Seen it, but doubt I'd find it.  SPAHEE one back is also 50.

#note 11H RE(SHAPED) 22.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGLRSY C2 LaYER..GS +78 367
#note Definitely wasn't expecting to bingo keeping SY, let alone play a 9.  13G aRGYLES 89 is best, though.  YEARLINGS, RESTYLING, and GLYCERINS also played here.  B10 GL(O)RY 38 is a nice delay.
>Liz_Gottlin: AELRTUW 13A .W +10 210
#note 14A (O)UTLAW 34?  Or take D1 before I do?
>Ryan_Fischer: ABENORW D1 WARE +35 402
#note Didn't think she'd buy (D)OWNBEAR*.  2B E(L)BOW 36?  WORE is better.
>Liz_Gottlin: AELORTU 15H OUTLEAR. +77 287
>Ryan_Fischer: BNOX 6L BOX +36 438
#note I forgot to write down this rack.  :/
>Liz_Gottlin: CESTU 13I CUTES +35 322
>Ryan_Fischer: CEILNTU -  +0 438
#note Champ says 2A UN(LA)CE 20.  This is the plural of CUTIS.  Oops.
>Liz_Gottlin: HIOSZ M5 Z... +13 335
#note Champ says (W)HIZ to block WINCE, no doubt.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEILNTU 1D .INCE +30 468
#note Champ says B12 (OW)N to go out with LUETIC or DUCTILE.
