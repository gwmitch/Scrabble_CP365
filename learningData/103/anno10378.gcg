#note in the context of the tournament I was a game back and down a bit on spread on the leaders. I needed to go 3-1 or 4-0 and pick up a bunch of spread to have a chance

>Caesar_Jaramillo: CLOPS J4 CLOPS +20 65
>jd: AEENOTW K5 OWE +25 117
#note with 5 Ns and 4 Ts left, not to mention two blanks, I might as well take the points with TOWNEE.

#note it felt like I should be able to score more with this rack.

depending on how crazy I'm feeling I could play AZO at C12 too.

#note it seemed reasonable to try to hit a bingo. just taking some points and trying to hit through the G looks maybe a little better than my play because I am giving up a lot of points. but it doesn't matter too much.
