#note I would expect vum to be a fair bit more defensive than ovum, but the numbers say it's not necessarily. ovum has a slight edge on the sim.

#note quackle is seriously not a fan of this play, but assuming she plays pretty defensively I need this lane pretty badly. I'm not a big fan of playing across at 8A because she can just play on column B and I will only be left with tough lanes to hit.

quackle's dislike of EEL is because it offers cheap points to the triple, but I think quackle significantly overestimated my bingo chances after LEV or REED.

#note it's a cool word, but I have to wonder why she wouldn't play at column H.

#note omg I'm actually in the lead! I figured that I would tack on the E because I need all the points I can get, and there won't be much bingoing from this point out.

#note I figured she had the Q, but it turned out that instead she exchaged and kept a great bingo leave - however, that's not going to be of any use to her on this board.
>jd: AEHNNRS A6 .N.H +17 313
#note with the Q out I really wanted to minimize turnover. this and ICHS were the two most important plays ofthe game

>jd: AAEKNRS I8 ...A +9 322
#note at the time I didn't think I had an alternative to this play, but quackle comes up with two plays that it thinks do better - KAAS at F2 or GAR at 11K. KAAS wins 90%, GAR 83%, my play 80%.

so the question is, what do those numbers mean? first of all I believe GAR is the function of misplays - responses to my opponent playing on row 12. quackle has me averaging 46 points a turn next turn if I play GAR. this is not a realistic number. As far as KAAS goes, I think I can see the idea. KAAS creates a Q spot if I draw QI, and I'm set if I draw QU. Even if I draw the Q and am going to get stuck with it, I have a 40 point headstart and I should still be able to outrun her. KAAS feels counterintuitive to me, but I can accept that it may be the right play.

>jd: AEKNRSU F2 KENS +24 346
#note I was trying to figure out a way to stick her with the Q. ultimately I was satisfied with this play because if she doesn't pay attention and plays QI I respond with QUA for 36, so it effectively sticks her. quackle's favorite of FERN at 12L setting up ANKUS and AUKS as outs actually does 1 worse - it doesn't come up with KENS as a suggestion.
>Glenda_Short: AEIQRSW M11 RAW +21 331
#note she should block my out. in fact playing QI sims as good as AR (best play that doesn't give me QUA) since it gives her sewar to go out.

#note phew! I was never sure I would win this one.
