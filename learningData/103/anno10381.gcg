#note Couldn't decide between this and QUOTED. This sims best, but I would obviously reqret not playing QUOTED over the next few turns...

#note I should ditch the freaking QU with PIQUE. Quackle likes just VOWED. I really didn't know what to do here, but F9 QI fishing for DEPUTIZING was really tempting...

#note Missed 15J AEDINE, but I think FOINED is good. The board isn't looking to hot and the F is pretty big. Plus the vowels are scarce, so AE is fine as a leave.

#note His rack. He regretted burning his vowels here.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEGOSS O12 ASEA +24 265
#note I had no idea what to do, but burning vowels seemed wrong. I was starting to run low on time here. N1 SAGA sims better. Crazy.

#note Does B8 DOSAGES block more bingos? It looks like it. Sim results show oppo has a slightly better chance to bingo after my play. For some reason I thought it wasn't likely he could play parallel to the D with the vowels unseen. But the WEBBED hook should have been on my radar (it didn't even occur to me... blugh.) Quackle says my play sims best, but that doesn't make sense. My win% is directly tied to his bingo%, barring some weird J stick or something.
