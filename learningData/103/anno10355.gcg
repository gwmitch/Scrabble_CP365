#note DESEX might be better, because it is much more conservative.

#note Actually blind to DOPE here, duh. Contemplated PONGID to draw a challenge, but decided against it. Actually, I guess EGIN isn't super stronghere, so DOPE might not be a superb play. I'm fine playing this.

#note Interesting play. This or H(o)G seems best, and the points of this are to much to pass up here.

>Noah: GGIMOST 14L M.G +14 302
#note Hoping he doesn't have the S, because I can make some waves.

>Noah: GINORST O11 GRIST +27 329
#note No good reason to fish here, so I cashed my setup. Actually, something like IR(E) may have been reasonable here.

>Noah: EINOOOR 6B OORIE +13 342
#note Didn't want to exchange, and this seemed like the best way to try and keep my lead. The bag isn't that scary, so hopefully I'll be okay.

>Noah: ABINNOT F1 BOTA +22 364
#note Yuck. Mistracked and thought he had CETUVY. Didn't even check the tiles on his rack! I saw the winning play of BONANZA, but thought I should block this "good spot" for his C. BONITO is best here.
