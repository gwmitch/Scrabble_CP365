>Lucas_Freeman: EILPSTV 8G PIT +10 10
#note Crescent City Cup, New Orleans LA. January 2012 (CSW12). Round 3.

I should have exchanged the V here. PIT is terrible. Not sure what I was thinking.
>Marty_Gabriel: AHOT J7 OATH +21 21
>Lucas_Freeman: AEIKLSV 11E VAKILS +34 44
#note Completely missed the L-hook on OATH. VAKIL plays at 6F and retains the S. This is an ugly way to open a game.
>Marty_Gabriel: ?EORTTX K1 EXTORTs +77 98
>Lucas_Freeman: AEEOORS J1 OO +17 61
>Marty_Gabriel: ABDINSU 5H UNB.AIDS +61 159

>Marty_Gabriel: DEI 2J ..IDE +26 185
>Lucas_Freeman: EILRRSU 6B SURLIER +63 175
#note No way am I playing LURRIES 9B with FF unseen. I'm not that desperate yet.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEGNO 5A GENOA +22 207
>Lucas_Freeman: EIMNTVW 12F WIN +21 196
#note VAW F10 looks like a clear winner here. MV has terrible synergy in a leave. 
>Marty_Gabriel: ADY 13E YAD +25 232
>Lucas_Freeman: EEIMTUV 1H EV.. +21 217
#note Marty complimented this play for opening a bingo lane, but he must not have known what I kept. The basic EMU 1M does fine with three lanes already open. HUMVEE 10J is an interesting choice I didn't even consider because I was too cautious about spending both E's. 
>Marty_Gabriel: AAGIOT 9E AGITA.O +20 252
>Lucas_Freeman: CEIMRTU L8 CRIME +33 250
#note Jumped all over the R-hook and didn't even glance at 8A where CRIME plays for 5 more points. I'm only beating myself. 
>Marty_Gabriel: EHOPU 8A OUPHE +44 296
>Lucas_Freeman: ?LLNTUW M10 NULL +16 266
#note UNWORTH D2 cleans up the junk a little better, but I didn't know it.
>Marty_Gabriel: BINR A1 BRIN. +27 323
>Lucas_Freeman: ?EEFGTW 1M EWT +26 292
#note Didn't know WEFTaGE 14I. 
>Marty_Gabriel: M D4 M.. +10 333
>Lucas_Freeman: ?CEFFGZ M4 F.zZ +25 317
#note MOR told me the Q was one of two in the bag. If I were to block the lone Q spot with ZIFF M4, I lose to N in the bag (ODEA N4) despite the Q stick. Played FIzZ instead to eliminate Marty's scoring options. If I didn't block the I, and Q were in the bag, Marty would have Q stuck me anyway with my useless blank. 
>Marty_Gabriel: DEENOQR N12 DOE +14 347
>Lucas_Freeman: ACEFG 14B CAFE +23 340
#note CAFE played for two more points at 4F.
>Marty_Gabriel: ENQR O13 REN +14 361
>Lucas_Freeman: G 10L ..G +8 348
#note Marty went one minute overtime, and I managed to win one of the worst games I've ever played by solving the endgame. Scrabble is a crazy game.
>Lucas_Freeman:  (Q) +20 368
