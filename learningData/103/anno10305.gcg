>Suhas_Rao: CHIN 9E CHIN +24 24
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AFGLMU 7H FUG +17 41
#note I briefly considered FrUGALM(AN)* before thinking better of it.  :)
>Suhas_Rao: ACOO E9 .OCOA +18 42
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AAELMM 12B AMM.LAtE +72 113
#note Matt saw my phony after the game and I said, hey, two Ms, two As, what am I supposed to do?  Settle for MALM?  (Really find ANALEMMA?)  But leave it to him to find the legitimate 9, MALAM(UT)Es!
>Suhas_Rao: EU C11 E.U +10 52
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEENOO 13I DONEE +21 134
#note Highest scoring, 3rd static.  A(UT)O does a bit better.
>Suhas_Rao: AEIKRSS K4 KAISERS +80 132
>Ryan_Fischer: ADFGIOY 8K .DIFY +42 176
#note This or FOGY.  It's easy to counter FOGY so that's why I chose EDIFY.
>Suhas_Rao: ATV L3 VAT +26 158
#note Closing the board...
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEGIOP 12L PAGE +26 202
#note Highest score, worse leave.  I tend to be good at finding crap like that.  7M PIA 25 for the paranoid.
>Suhas_Rao: NPU 14J PUN +28 186
>Ryan_Fischer: AIJNORR G11 R.JA +19 221
#note Champ wants me to play JO(G) which has me ahead 57% of the time after two plays.  That E/S/T hook is clearly more threatening to me than to Q.  I figure by playing R(A)JA I move the hook over giving up a few points if he does hit it at the expense of making it harder to hit.
>Suhas_Rao: EZ N8 .EZ +35 221
>Ryan_Fischer: IILNORS 15E NISI +24 245
#note SIRLOIN no go, just wanting to kill that hook.  If he hits the Y, I'll eat my hat.  And I am HATLESS (HASLETS/SHELTAS).  To me, ROSIN looks much better.  The sim really likes R(E)OIL.
>Suhas_Rao: WX B11 W.X +27 248
#note Well, it's open again.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELNORTY 14A OY +44 289
#note Had to take a deep breath to make this play.
>Suhas_Rao: BL 14F B.L +23 271
#note More fishing...
>Ryan_Fischer: ELNORTW 15L TROW +31 320
#note Or TOWN, leaving ELR.  WROTE at least forces his bingo into the triple lane unless it ends in vowel/E.
>Suhas_Rao: IIOO -IIOO +0 271
>Ryan_Fischer: EELNNOS A8 LENO +18 338
#note Debate of whether to play LENO or LONE.  Never play LENO.  Heh.  I wasn't expecting a bingo ending in -IL, obviously, so I didn't think it'd make much difference.
>Suhas_Rao: ?DEILRT B3 TEnDRIL +65 336
#note There's where I eat my nonexistent hat.  Three bingos hitting the Y, and a 9 through AT: fILTR(AT)ED for 59.  DIRECTLY, DEVILTRY, TRENDILY.  It coulda been worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: BEHINSV 4A H.BE +26 364
#note Champ likes B(E)VIES.  I don't wanna spend the S yet.  At least there's no scoring stuff in the bag, but there's an off chance he's got a bingo, including three more that hit the Y.  Oh well.  I liked this for scoring and keeping the S.  (More scoring next turn!~)
