>Karris: AAGU G8 .UGA +13 13
#note He set down AJUGA at first, but decidd on this after some reflection.
>Noah: EINNORZ 10B ZONIN. +38 64
#note I could play GINZO, but I'd rather not give him a scoring spot for his A. 
>Karris: ABDERST E8 TR.BADES +72 85
#note John saw the best play a few seconds after he hit his clock.

>Noah: CFGILRW L10 GRIF. +18 293
#note I thought CLW would be better than GRW, and couldn't stomach CGLR at all. I'll stick with my decision not to play WIFE, but Quackle actually prefers GRW to CLW. I don't understand this.

#note Patience is rewarded. (Y)EA and OE both save this play in reserve for next turn. TOEA does that too, and blocks a bingo lane. It's a pretty weak block though, so I prefer the other two. To be honest I didn't really care at this point, but this still seems instructive.
