#note we've all found out since mike moved out here that he's a seriously tough customer, but this was actually one of the first times we've played in a tournament.
>Mike_Frentz: AIILO 7I AIOLI +13 13
>jd: ?DIIOOS 6D OpIOIDS +72 92
#note I stared at this rack for ages and only saw BIOSOLID which I wasn't sure about (it's good) and then finally saw this. passing up the 6 points is apparently a 2 point mistake, but I don't mind it.

#note I thought smeek was collins for some reason but it doesn't matter. he almost challenged!

#note I really wasn't sure this was good - it must have shown from the way I played it because he challenged.

#note meh? there were really no good options with this rack except fishing even though that's a dumb thing to be doing up 200. in the end it doesn't really matter.

#note the obvious choice is, well, to take the 65 points - but he's going to be able to Q stick me. it turns out that it's still the best option over playing QI now.
>Mike_Frentz: FGIOTTY H5 T. +2 255
#note he is totally right to Q stick me here, but it does allow me to block his best play on row 3
>jd: FLQU B1 ..L +4 544
#note isn't quelf a board game? I was trying to play off my own tiles as slow as possible. quackle actually says it's not woth blocking C3 at all, which I find surprising. So far as I can tell quackle is actually misplaying some moves along the way because when I go through the whole thing, blocking ZAG is 6 better.
