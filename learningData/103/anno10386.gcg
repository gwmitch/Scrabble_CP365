#note VAU I never saw it either, even if I made rubeolar I would have still lost in the recount, Deen missed 2 points for levators should have 74, I gave myself 28 points for jab it should have 24 oh man and 2 more extra points for detain. I was even claiming 24 points for Qat which Dean, caught I need to count better!
