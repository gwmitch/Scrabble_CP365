#note Right spot, but BEDU looks better here.

#note It's a big sacrifice over GHAZI and HAZY, but it seemed worth it to block off more of the board, especially since Bruce is just going to block himself in.
>Bruce_Ward: QT F7 Q.T +23 199
>Noah: GISTUVY 14J GUTSY +39 273
#note Perhaps VUGS instead. The Y will be valuable for scoring, while the V is pretty clunky as usual. 
>Bruce_Ward: EELNW N10 WE. +32 231
#note Bruce was disappointed that I blocked his monster play.
>Noah: EGINNRV K8 GENI. +16 289
#note Didn't know what to do here, but I figured blocking the last good bingo lane was good. The question is: is it good enough to block? Should I just do GIV(e)N or something instead?
>Bruce_Ward: AMP E10 AMP +31 262
>Noah: EINORRV I10 VI.R +10 299
#note Just didn't know what to do here at all. This probably isn't very good, but I didn't want to open. Didn't see (S)I(G)N, which looks good.

>Bruce_Ward: EIL G10 LI.E +12 298
>Noah: AAEMNOR 14E AE +10 329
#note Why not at O10? This seemed like a good leave to keep, plus it didn't open up the board. 
>Bruce_Ward: NOO 4H NOO +12 310
#note I was hoping to get the same tiles to play at K4, but alas.
>Noah: AFMNNOR 3J MORN +16 345
#note Didn't have much time, so I just picked something. Anything should win. Afraid to do FON becausemaybe I missed a bingo in the pool.
>Bruce_Ward: EELOTTT C12 TOT +11 321

#note FORE is 7 better.
