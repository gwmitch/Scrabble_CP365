#note 14B DOE(T)H 34?  I like keeping it tight even though I'm better at an open board.  Counterintuitive, sure, and probably why I didn't fare as well this game.

#note Or OAF.
>Rahn_McKeown: IT A7 TI. +15 200
#note ETIC or OTIC in play.  He tells me later he had OVICIDE, chickened out.
>Ryan_Fischer: DELOOOU -LOOOU +0 198
#note Q says keep DEL.  Nah.  Ls suck.

#note Here's where I lose the game.  The "right" play isn't exactly right.  PED is much safer, but I so wanted to play another consonant.

#note Le'dammit!
>Ryan_Fischer: EELLRST O8 RE.ELL +21 233
#note 6A ELL 11 leaving ERST.  Yeah, I need to bingo back soon, but where?
>Rahn_McKeown: ?DEIIOV 13L VIO. +14 289
#note I think here's where he must have had OVIcIDE.
>Ryan_Fischer: EHMOSTW D4 SHOWM.. +36 269
#note Haha.  Well, flashy is what can keep me in the game, but Murphy's Scrabble law is oftentimes when you've found flashy there is flashier.  So while SHOWM(EN) is spiffy, SOMEWH(EN) is even spiffier!  :D  11J WOT 23... but I don't see myself bingoing on this board right now anyway.
>Rahn_McKeown: IK C3 KI +14 303
#note Oh... crap.  He's got one or both blanks now.  I'm probably sunk.
>Ryan_Fischer: EENORTT 5C T.E +19 288
#note When will I learn EE > EO?  I'm so fixated on undoubling I forget that too much.  Still, I think the hooks for THE are more potent.

#note Great, now I've got to block when down and pray.  Isn't this a fine kettle of fish?
>Rahn_McKeown: ??EINOZ 2C sOZINEs +73 379
#note Duh, Rahn.  How could you miss A1 EpIZoO(TIC) 84?  I mean really?  The bingos don't even show up on the static radar.  That's how screwed I am.  F2 ZONE 40 is "best" static.  Champ says 6C E(O)N 13.  I have no idea why.  :)  Of note: bIZONEs for 75.  Fishing off the O for (G)O(A) sims pretty well too.
