#note I overdrew before this play and he tossed back...I can't remember. He flipped over the H and the N. good thing I still got a bingo down. overdraws make me sad.

#note viced never occurred to me, but if you treat the FF and the Z as two separate strong scoring units, you can see why it would work out better than the highly antisynergetic CEVZ. FFZ averages 3 more points a turn next turn than VICED. that said, I'd be a little hesitant about giving conrad more lanes after what looks like a fish last turn - but you have to figure he's probably going to hit it whether or not I give him a lane.

#note against fast players like leesa and conrad I've been trying to make sure to get the easy plays down faster.

>jd: ACDELTZ B10 CLADE +38 216
#note this was a challenging decision that took up a lot of time. CLADE sims a few points off of the scoring plays with the Z. I thought at first that the top-simming play of ADZ at B12 is pretty nuts, but the more I look at it the more it's intriguing - his last play may suggest that he's consonant-heavy. ultimately the problem is that there's just not that many great spots for the Z.

#note bad luck for him, he probably didn't read me as having QZ. Note that ESTU bingoes more than ENSU. I'm not sure that UN really have any synergy relative to UR or UT (although UL is ugly).

#note I might as well score some points since I have no particularly good blocks for SPICA. that said, I hadn't started paying attention to the lane on row 15 yet - it might be worth playing HI at A14 to shut that down.

#note I managed to get myself low on time and tried to jam BOOT on the board before I ran out of time. Unfortunately one of my tiles was only half-in, which I pointed out mostly-jokingly to conrad. Given that the tournament was over and placement was set anyway, tyrannical director xp ruled that my play was going to come off the board. we would've been cool with the ruling one way or the other.
