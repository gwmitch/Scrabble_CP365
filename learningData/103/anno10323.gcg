>Joey: ?DEHIIO 8G OI +4 4
>Jason: ADFJSSV -ADFV +0 0
#note (Ditch the J. Too hung up on not throwing power tiles back. In hindsight, keeping SS looks best.)
>Joey: ?DEEHIO 7G HOE +22 26
>Jason: GJNRSST H6 J..NS +12 12
#note (Umm, why not through the other OI? Or JOIST? Still clearing the "first game" cobwebs out that morning, apparently.)
>Joey: ?DDEIKO J5 KIDDOEs +74 100
>Jason: AGGRSTT K4 GAT +22 34
>Joey: DEENNPY F8 PENNY +17 117
#note I didn't see DEPEND 8J. It even has New York as a leave, whereas PENNY keeps Delaware. (As you can see, I would have preferred Joey play DEPEND.)
>Jason: AADGRST 12C GRA. +16 50
#note (How'd I miss GAYDAR? Shaddup.)
>Joey: ADEMMRT 8J .AMMED +45 162
>Jason: ADEFOST L4 OF +26 76
>Joey: ?ERTTUU 11J .UTURE +10 172
#note Jason suddenly wondered if I had called the blank an F. I mentioned that it might happen later. Inarticulate mirthful sounds ensued. (It took me a while to get that joke. And I was mostly happy because my bingo stayed open.)
>Jason: AADELST N2 DEALAT.S +72 148
>Joey: ?EEIRRT D6 TERRIE.s +58 230
>Jason: BEIIINR M1 RIB +21 169
#note (Seeing BI(D)I would've been nice, especially given how this enhanced Joey's play.)
>Joey: EFILPTU 1F UPLIFTE. +92 322

>Joey: EOOQWXZ B6 ZOO +67 389

>Jason: AELNSUV C12 .UV +16 302
>Joey: AELOTWX O11 .XTOL +60 477
#note This stuff always happens when Jason plays in an Open or me. (lol! I'd forgotten TSAHTMIAO. In hindsight, I was probably being a little overdramatic, and part of it was due to my own shortcomings. And, as Joey pointed out in his NO anno vs. Ubeika, "always" is a little narrow-minded.)
>Jason: AEILNSV 14G ALEVINS +83 385
#note (According to CP, I am supposed to forgo the extra points and play VALINES instead. Almost did it over the board. Good to know.)
>Joey: ABEIOWY H12 WI.Y +42 519
#note (Congrats to Joey for improving his average against me in six games to 511. That's pretty impressive.)
>Jason: CS 2B S.C +10 395
#note (As in "This game makes me...." So much for the pipe dreams of winning it all.)
>Jason:  (ABEO) +12 407
