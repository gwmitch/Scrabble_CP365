>Sykes: ENTTY 7H TENTY +17 33
#note Scored as 18 in the actual game.
>Steve_: AEIRUVY E6 AVI.RY +24 43
#note About seventh down the list. V(O)YEUR is best. Never saw it.
>Sykes: ?DEFFNO 10H sENDOFF +76 109
>Steve_: EEEISUW 11K EWE +28 71
#note My impulse was to jump on the O column and burn the S for easy points. Luckily I took my time and found this, which is easily best.
>Sykes: HHOR 6B HOR.H +27 136
>Steve_: BEEILSU 12I LUBE +30 101
#note Behind BLUE at 12k, which I didn't see, but would have a tough time justifying even if I had.
>Sykes: IIIII -  +0 136
#note Chris exchanged six tiles.
>Steve_: BEGIIPS O7 BIGS +35 136
>Sykes: AQ K5 QA. +24 160
>Steve_: EEILPST L4 PI +19 155
#note Right idea, but a major miss not to keep going and playing PIL(Y) or PI(T)Y for 12 more points. I was bumming that his play blocked my bingo.

#note Duck likes taking 22 for a drop of an S at 8k. My play doesn't even come up in the list of choices, and it sims poorly against QATS. I like it, as it opens a hard to block bingo line and yet still scores some points. But it's probably better to wait a turn or two for this gambit and let Chris struggle on the closed board to score points or risk opening it up.
>Sykes: CORRV H13 .OC +18 308
#note Chris feels compelled to play defensive to a degree. After the game he said his leave after this move was terrible and that it included two Rs and the V.
>Steve_: AAEGISS A11 SAI.E +24 273
#note Alas, I saw the non-go. I need points, duck agrees this to be best.
>Sykes: AINRRUV 15H .URN +6 314
#note I was happy to see Chris getting defensive here, and started to think I maybe could win without bingoing.
>Steve_: ADEGIOS 5C GO +16 289
>Sykes: ADEERVZ 4D DEV +22 336
>Steve_: ADEINPS G4 AD +11 300
#note Playing DIN 13L as suggested by the duck can get me within about 15 when all is said and done. A tile tracking error cost me a bunch of spread. I was a tile off, and down to my last few seconds.
