>Matthew: ADENOSU 9I UDO +11 11
#note This play just edges out OVA, AVO, and VAU.
>Craig_Rowland: GINSW 10J SWING +26 40
>Matthew: AEHNSVZ O6 HAZES +61 72
#note I don't know SWINGE, so I spent my S in vain.
>Craig_Rowland: JO N5 JO +18 58
>Matthew: BDKNUVW 7J BUNK +22 94
#note Best.
>Craig_Rowland: IPRT L4 PRI.T +16 74
>Matthew: BDMQTVW -BDMQTVW +0 94
#note Best again.
>Craig_Rowland: DEN K9 ..NED +18 92
>Matthew: ACEEIRY M3 YEA +26 120
#note Best again. But CE(D)ARY is a pretty second place. Good thing I opted out of *EYECARE because I was sure that was good.
>Craig_Rowland: AF N2 FA +15 107
>Matthew: ACDEIRS 12E DECIAR.S +74 194
#note Only bingo.
>Craig_Rowland: ELRT H11 L.TER +15 122
>Matthew: ?BMRRTX 14G B.RM +14 208
#note This play is tops in win %, but is just slightly behind BeRM and BaRM at 1O for 40 pts. I did consider those plays. But I opted for the 14 pointer because a 100 pt lead isn't THAT hot when I'm leaving the E and R wide open at the bottom. B(E)RM scores low, but makes my lead less surmountable.
>Craig_Rowland: EERW O1 WERE +35 157
#note Live and learn. I guess I should have played there.
>Matthew: ?DNNRTX -DNT +0 208
#note Wow. Leave it to me to pick the worst possible exchange. All the best plays throw the X back in the bag. I figured on a non-bingo friendly board, high point consonants become more desirable as the main source of points. I lost about 5.5 equity on this play.
>Craig_Rowland: AEHIOOS -AEHIO +0 157
>Matthew: ?FGNORX 13D GOX +23 231
#note FOX is best, but again I'm opting to prepare for a tight board and keeping a 4-point tile. 2.5 pt equity.
>Craig_Rowland: AEILMST 15A MISALTE. +87 244
>Matthew: ?FINORT 13K .IF +16 247
#note What sucks more than you bingo getting blocked by another bingo? No top play scores over 18 here. DIF sims pretty well, but FOR(DO) is the strong play I missed. Opens up a line for my blank when Craig likely does not have bingo tiles.
>Craig_Rowland: OOP 14B POO +24 268
>Matthew: ?ENOORT 4K O.. +5 252
#note This is my first low-simming play of the game. Q wants me to take the points with ENROOT at J15. I like my chances with TONER? to bingo at the line I just opened. It's not easy to block.
>Craig_Rowland: NU J4 NU +8 276
>Matthew: ?CENORT G2 CONTRi.E +64 316
#note Good block by Craig. But I have CONTRiVE! But count on Quackle to always one-up me. Best is CONCERTI. I wish.
>Craig_Rowland: ?DEEILV 6B sLIVE.ED +63 339
>Matthew: AAEHIOT 11D AAH +33 349
#note I thought I needed to take the points here, but ACHIOTE up top is best for pretty much guaranteeing an out (barring a Q draw).
>Craig_Rowland: GILQTUY B1 QUILT. +28 367
#note Ok so here's where I had to start thinking. I'm down by 18 and I have AEIOT to Craig's GY. There's a winning sequence and it took me ten minutes to find.
>Matthew: AEIOT 4A E.ATIO. +16 365
#note An appropriate find considering my sentiment at the time.
>Matthew:  (GY) +12 377
