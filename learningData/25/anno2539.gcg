#note Correctly passed on ICER; one of those that should be good but isn't. Still, Speedy likes VAST at 10F, which I discarded as the S-hog I am.

#note Yeah, I missed a really high-prob bingo. If I hadn't been playing so fast, I like to think I would've seen it. I was pretty sure something played through the L; I just couldn't see it.
>Alex_Fiszbein: Q 7G Q. +42 261
#note I believe this is where I laid a "You stinker!" on him.
>Jason: ADEINST A8 SEDATIN. +83 187
