#note Best barely edging out 8F CAVY.
>andy: ABEY 7J ABEY +18 18
>Jeremy: AEEEFRS 8L FEAR +47 71
#note 8L FERE -1.1 Obviously for the more balanced AES leave.  I was thinking about challenging ABEY* off but realized if I did, I'd be playing I6 FA(V)E for a gain of 12.  Andy scores -18 to my +47 this way for a gain of 29.

#note paid for that error.

#note 4C cUTESIE would have been fine, but I couldn't remember if that was good. 1E EqUITES sims best, and H8 (A)UdITEES scores best.  My play is simply too risky when I have much safer options.  I started putting down CErUSITE, but I thought the R would be slightly less risky. -14.5 equity loss to best play.
>andy: CEORSTU 15A COURTE.S +140 282
#note not the start to the tournament I wanted.

#note Best.
>andy: AQST 10J QATS +40 322
>Jeremy: BDIOPRU 3J UPDO +29 229
#note 11I DIB -3.2 equity. I'm far enough back I'm considering 3F *UPBROID.  
>andy: XZ K9 Z.X +38 360
>Jeremy: BEHIOPR 11B PHOEB. +26 255
#note F2 REBOP -9.9 equity.  Still it's under 1% to win.  I was trying to unload all my clunkers, but I took out the best bingo lines on the board doing it.
>andy: ENW C10 W.EN +20 380

#note Best.

#note -1.3 equity to 2F RAIA
>andy: DEINNRU -DEINN +0 389
>Jeremy: AEEHRRW 10A WA. +18 319
#note b9 RA(PE) wins 5.23%.  -0.7 equity.  My play wins just 2.25%
>andy: AIIN 2F INIA +14 403
>Jeremy: EEHINRR 3A ERRHINE +77 396
#note -9.3 equity loss (on Many play) to 4C ERRHINE.  According to Quack, the win percentage play is N4 HIE keeping ENRR... in hopes of bingoing out.
>andy: ?GIILNV A2 L.aVING +30 433
>Jeremy: ADMTU D2 T.UD +16 412
#note -4 equity to 10E MA(T)T.  I have just 20 seconds.  Mind you Andy did not play quickly, but I'm still frantic.  A tough luck game where I paid large for two mistakes.  The Eiffel tower wasn't lucky for me this time.
