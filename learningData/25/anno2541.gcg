>Matt_Robin: BRUX 8F BRUX +26 26
>Jason: AELMOOP 7H MOO +20 20
#note Carol sat on my side and watched basically the whole game. "Tournament names are not acceptable," she noted.
>Matt_Robin: EGO 9G EGO +26 52
>Jason: ?AAEILP 10E APE +14 34
#note Knew I was missing a bingo. Well, at least I don't know APhELIA.
>Matt_Robin: IIIII -IIIII +0 52
>Jason: ?AHIILR 11E HILA +32 66
#note Speedy says HILI is 1.9 better.
>Matt_Robin: DEIIPRT K7 RIPTIDE +76 128
#note I tried to impress Matt by pointing out the anagram afterward (another rack I always whiff on). I don't think I succeeded.
>Jason: ?CIORST 12A CORTInS +87 153
#note Earning me $1 for that round's prize (high bingo) and a "cute play" from Matt.
>Matt_Robin: EEGIRZ A9 GRE.IZE +57 185
#note Held, but correctly unchallenged. Beautiful play.
>Jason: ACEGKLY L3 CAKEY +38 191
#note Took me forever to see the stupid hook. Just behind LACKEY and CAKY, same spot.
>Matt_Robin: FHO L11 FOH +34 219
>Jason: DDGLQVV -DGLQVV +0 191
>Matt_Robin: ANN B11 N.NA +34 253
>Jason: ADEFJUW 5J JU.ED +34 225
#note Carol walked by; I pointed at the rack and said "I exchanged to get this!" She asked: "What'd you have before?!" Didn't know JAUKED; slight error.
>Matt_Robin: NTU 14L NUT +16 269
#note He was clearly not thrilled with this play, which made me (correctly) think he didn't have an S.
>Jason: AAEFINW 15M NAW +22 247
#note "Interesting" stat: In games 3 and 4 combined, I drew one N. Sim moves this block-y play up with ?SSS out, but it's still behind six others, including plays I considered like WIFE at M9 or FIAN(C)E at 3H.
>Matt_Robin: ?DEIMTT N5 .EMITTeD +65 334
>Jason: AAEEFIV -  +0 247
#note Don't know hooks (EMITTED). Don't know fives (DEMIT). Didn't see ADMITTED in the same spot. Adds up to a lost turn and me right behind the 8-ball.
>Matt_Robin: ANN O6 NAN +21 355
>Jason: AAEEFIV 3J FA.E +18 265
#note I could not trust myself on FACIAE and rationalized it by saying I didn't want an E in the triple column anyway.
>Matt_Robin: ATV N1 VAT +22 377
>Jason: AEGILRV 1L VI.A +42 307
>Matt_Robin: ORW I11 ROW +18 395
>Jason: EEGLQRS 2I GEL +15 322
#note Yep, pick up the Q just as it's too late to exchange. Of course, I deserve it for the missed bingo and bad challenge. But all is not lost; Duck gives me a 2.12% win opportunity. I could pull the U and have a bingo with this rack.
>Matt_Robin: BI F6 BI. +13 408
>Jason: EEOQRSS 7E Q. +11 333
#note I can't win, but it limits the margin of defeat. Thought for sure I'd eat it.
>Matt_Robin: DILOSUY 14F LOUSY +25 433
#note "What a lousy play!" I commented. Ducky also says it's lousy, though I don't know why. I had him low on time.
>Jason: EELORSS 15E LOSS +22 355
#note I might've found SLOES if Carol wasn't rushing me! :) Besides, this was too fitting.
>Matt_Robin: DI 9A .ID +7 440
#note Neither of us saw the other 7-point out until Wedell pointed it out. Again, equity lost almost equals margin of defeat. I'm not too upset over this one.
>Matt_Robin:  (EER) +6 446
