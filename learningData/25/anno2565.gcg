>jeff: AEHIIIL 8G HILI +14 14
#note This is clearly the best play, and ILIA 8F and HILI 8E (!) are also preferred to exchanging. 
>hector: DEEGILP 9E GIED +16 16
#note Best, a slight edge over PELE 7F (never considered that for some reason) and GHI G7 (yeah, good save, but I'm not gonna play that way). 
>jeff: AEIMRRW J6 WA.R +15 29
#note The star play is ARMIGER, and WIRRA is also preferred. WAIR and WEIR, interestingly, sim neck and neck. 
>hector: AEEJLPR K3 JAPE +31 47
#note I started to play JAPER, then I took the R back, because I'm hopelessly devoted to the letter R. Anyway, the Duck says -1.5. 
>jeff: EHIMNOR E2 HOMERIN. +78 107
#note This rack will make three potential eights, if you're so inclined. This round-tripper makes Jeff about a 67-percent favorite to win. 
>hector: EFLRTUX 3K .UT +20 67
#note I looked for a while, suspecting there was a better play and there is, LUREX D3. Ack. JUT is second, 4.4 back; at least it sets up a likely FLUX or JUTE/FLEX next turn. For the aggressive and crazy, consider the kamikaze ARTFUL 7J. 
>jeff: ADEMNTY 2A DEAT.Y +42 149
#note The hook-friendly D column provides most of the goodies: MAYED, MATEY, YAMEN. There's also MEATY and MEANY at N2. DEATHY still wins 80 percent of the time, but it's 8 valuation points back. Sometimes it's easy to miss good plays when the board is this fertile (see my LUREX miss a turn earlier). 
>hector: EFLRXZ L1 FL.X +54 121
#note I didn't write my full rack here and the missing tile (A, B, I) tells a story. If I had the A, I missed RELAX N2. If it's an I, the miss is REFIX. Find a good play, then find a better play, blah bah blah. And just because your anticipated play is there, don't take it immediately! I put down FLUX pretty quickly, like the hack I am. 
>jeff: BLMNUVV C1 V.V +18 167
#note Nasty rack, but the best play. My lucky FLUX hit and Jeff's crummy draw chops his winning percentage down from 80 to about 59. 
>hector: ABEIIRZ 1H BRIE. +30 151
#note Wow, this is pretty dreadful, a blunder (Q: -18). For some reason I completely flaked on the B-Y potential at 1F. A 750 player can come up with BIZ, or BIZE, and anyone good should see BAIZE pretty easily. Worse yet, I never even saw FRIZ! I'd like to blame this on Game 7 and being a little tired, but that's weak. I suck. Leave it at that. The leave scared me off FAZE, and I figured ADZ or ADZE would be there later. 
>jeff: BELMNOU N2 LEMON +29 196
#note If you have 11,000 sevens in your book, you should bingo here. I didn't know it. The slight favorite otherwise is BELON N2, followed by ODEUM A1 and NUMEN 8A. MELON, LEMON and LUMEN are close. 
>hector: AAAEINZ O6 AZAN +41 192
#note There are a lot of interesting choices, but AZAN comes out two points clear of the field. I did see all the main options for once (NAZI O5, ADZE A1, AMAZE 4D, AZINE O6) and I had no strong feel that AZAN was best. 
>jeff: BOQRTUY 7C QU.RT +32 228
#note Much the best, ahead of the N8 options and BORTY L6. 
>hector: AAEIIOS A1 I.EA +18 210
#note IDEA wins the sim, though ADIOS A1 hangs around (with three esses and two blanks unseen, the first S isn't that valuable, but why would you want to draw to AEI otherwise?) and AMIA at 4D (?) wins the percentage fight. There are a lot of ways to extend IDEA down to or through A8, but with the Z out of the game, most of them aren't that tasty. 
>jeff: ?BELOOY N8 BOY +22 250
#note There's one playable bingo on this rack (I didn't know it, not that way). The best non-bingo by far is OY D4. Quackle prefers BOYO to BOY (no reason to keep the O, really), and the cute play is EMBOLY 4D. 
>hector: ADIOSSU B4 AIDS +26 236
#note I saw a way to score with this rubbish rack and took it pretty quickly. I had the right spot but the wrong play, DUOS is a lot better. There are a handful of plays ahead of AIDS and they all rid the U (AUDIOS in row 11 comes in second). As a Michigan guy, I should know not to trust a leave of OSU. 
>jeff: ??EGLNO 11H LEGiONs +70 320
#note Jeff's now better than a 93 percent favorite to grab the rubber game. 
>hector: EGOOSSU H11 .OGOS +21 257
#note This is the best winning percentage play (just under 4 percent), but there are some preferred valuation choices (GOYS is best from that angle). I'm hoping to get really lucky with a quick bingo, but things look bleak. 
>jeff: CINNRTU L10 C.RN +12 332
#note So long as Jeff doesn't take a nap, he's probably home. UN at D4 is an interesting fish, scores 14 and the leave plays nice with all of those floaters in the H column. 
>hector: ADEERSU 4D E.U +10 267
#note Relatively speaking, I actually missed some pretty good plays. Take another look. 
>jeff: INPSTUW I10 P.W +13 345
#note Back to my last rack, FLUXED would actually kick the winning percentage up to 12; still a Hail Mary, but that's how you steal games (or at least spread). As for this position, UPTOWN is the best game-clincher, mucking up things nicely and racing towards the end of the game. 
>hector: ADEEORS O1 DOSE +37 304
#note There are three good options here, I found one of them (my reward is a 17 percent chance at winning). There is one way to score 38 points, and it gives a 21-percent shot at the bailout. Answer next page. 
>jeff: AINSTTU 4J T.. +10 355
#note DONEES M9 scores 38 on the previous rack (less preferred by the duck is DONEE in the same spot). As for this rack, there is a bingo, fairly high-prob but not that easy to see, IMHO. No worries, Jeff has something bigger and better on the way. 
>hector: AEEIORT 6E .E +8 312
#note I was pretty fried, I know there's almost no shot at this play working. 
>jeff: ACINSTU C7 .UANTICS +90 445
#note Beautiful play. I thought we were playing world rules and I decided to give Jeff an extra five points. Wait, I lose my turn? Stupid double challenge. 
>hector: AEIKORT -  +0 312
#note See if you can find the 40-point play. I opted to put the 312 points on account. 
>jeff: F J1 .F +13 458
#note RESOAK 14A was best on the previous rack. Jeff's 13 are best here, in two spots. Well played, amigo. 
>jeff:  (AEIKORT) +22 480
