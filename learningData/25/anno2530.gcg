#note Had Jerry given me one of the Us he traded, I would have been grateful. GOALIE wins the sim here, if only because there really aren't any worthwhile exchanges.
>Jerry_L: HI 8G HI +10 10
>Carl: ACEKLMN 7F CALK +24 24
#note Several plays do better here. I considered things like CLANK F6 or MACK F7. I figured that CALK kept his bingo options to a minimum.
>Jerry_L: EP I7 .EP +18 28
>Carl: ?EGILMN 10C MINGLEs +72 96
#note I felt that this bingo made things toughest for my opponent, who is certainly close to a bingo. You might prefer MELtING 10F for the extra 4 points.

>Carl: AFGTTYZ L4 TA.FY +36 132
#note Smooth. Unload the junk and set up a big Z play.
>Jerry_L: ?BEILOU M8 OBLIqUE +77 189
>Carl: ADGTWYZ O4 WA.DY +51 183
#note It's a shame burning the D for OBLIQUED, but this is clearly the best play. G(YO)ZA is an interesting alternative, but the leave is even worse and it burns the very valuable Z.
>Jerry_L: DINOR 14J DIN.RO +22 211
>Carl: AEGSTWZ 15M SEW +44 227
#note This time ZA wins the sim.
>Jerry_L: AEOQRTU 4F TORQUA.E +68 279
#note Two Q-bingos! Too bad I didn't play ZA, huh?

>Jerry_L: DNORU H10 .NDURO +27 306
>Carl: AAEEGNT H1 AGE. +15 296
#note GEAR is better. I'm likely to draw an I for some -ING word.
>Jerry_L: JU 2F JU. +27 333
>Carl: AEEINPT 3M PE +16 312
#note I spent a long time on this rack. I went through all the different things I could draw after JET F2 and decided-- correctly-- that it wasn't worth it.

>Jerry_L: AIOSTVX D9 V.SIT +16 373
#note This would have been a prime candidate for Most Strategic Play. Here Jerry sacrifices the S to ensure the win. Yes, he could have played the X now at G12, but I might bingo. Now he sets up MOXA C10 or OX G12 and blocks seven, count em', seven lanes! How VeXATIOuS of him.
>Carl: CEIMRRT 5B CRIME +29 368
#note When Jerry played VISIT, the camera did one of those disorienting "zoom in while panning out" tricks that makes the background seem like it's moving relative to the stationery subject. **How could he have known that I had bingos through either of the two Is in that column?** It was like he could see into my soul.
>Jerry_L: ANOX G12 AXON +43 416
>Carl: EGILORT 1L TROG +30 398
#note My composure shattered, I miss his outplay. GROT scores more besides. I'm officially on tilt. If the game against Tiekert didn't do it to me, this one did. Fortunately, this was also the last game of the day, which is a pretty good time to be on tilt, relatively speaking.
