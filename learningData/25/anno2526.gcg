#note Close second to Q's fishy suggestion: YOD.

>Matthew: ACDEISU J5 DUI +8 34
#note EDACIOUS is a high prob bingo I have just never seen before. I never was one who studied all the 5-v-8's. But the CDS+vowel bingoes should be coming up in my study soon.
>Jeff_Clark: AEINTZ F5 TZI.ANE +39 52
>Matthew: AACEGLS D4 CAGE. +22 56
#note This is disappointing. Another miss. I don't know SCALAGE and I chickened out on GLACES. French words throwing me off.

>Jeff_Clark: CFIO 4L FOCI +33 111

#note Q can't decide. SLEEK is points, but MOLE is nice too.
>Jeff_Clark: AEIRRSV 9H ARRIVES +68 179
#note Wow. Jeff misses the 3x3. And thank God because I've had enough of getting smoked with one of those every time I leave a triple lane open for one turn.
>Matthew: EEMNRSU O1 MUR.NE +24 190
#note My play sims poorly. 11B NEUME is a nice find. 11E MENU is second.

#note Best bingo, but (RE)SOUNDED is neat.
>Jeff_Clark: AEILV -  +0 280
#note Challenged
>Matthew: EHNNTTU H1 THUN. +39 346
#note It takes me way to long to convince myseld that THUNK is, indeed, an acceptable conjugation of THINK. Whoda thunk it?
>Jeff_Clark: AEILV 12K ALIVE +26 306
>Matthew: EGILNTW 14J WET +33 379
#note I'm lucky to have a balanced rack here, let alone a potential bingo rack. I overdrew by 3 and Jeff was able to give me the choice garbage on the overdraw procedure.
