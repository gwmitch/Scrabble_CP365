>Fred: ELTWY 8D WETLY +30 30
>Phil: AACINPT 7C CAP +19 19
#note Huh, Q doesn't love it. Top choice is TAP for 11 points, followed by PA for 12 and PAW for 8. I'll take the points to dump the C.
>Fred: AJNORSU G2 JOURNA.S +68 98

>Fred: CO E4 CO......... +32 130
#note Sweet.
>Phil: ADDEMUU D11 AMU +22 115
#note Some cool plays better than this: DADGUM 14B (never seen it), DUNAM 13C (don't know it), MOUNDED 6D (sexy).

>Fred: EFIOOTY 15A AZ.n +36 177
>Fred: EFIOOTY --  -36 141
#note Not sure what he was thinking here; I guess a combo of AZAN and AZINE.
>Phil: DDEEFIW F8 .EWED +42 173
#note Best, also makes the board look really cool.
>Fred: GMR 15A GR.M +30 171
#note If AZIN* would have only been 36 and used a blank, why not just play this?
>Phil: DFINOQS H1 DO +18 191
#note Yes, the Q is bad, but I didn't think burning an S for 4 points was worth losing the Q, especially because I'm keeping QIS for next turn if I need it. I still like DO. Exch. FOQ or DFIOQ are interesting options too.
>Fred: ?ITX C3 ToXI. +26 197
#note He said at the time that he knew the play was bad. He could've played TIC in the same spot, setting up the X.

>Phil: BELOPTY I11 PLY +25 343
#note A prime example of me not knowing leaves. BOY and POLY/PLOY sim best, followed by BY (all in the same spot). I like BEY, considering the 7 Es unseen.
