#note Wow. Turn 1, Game 1 of a big tournament and I miss a high probability bingo. I didn't know this one, somehow, since I thought about playing GELATE or LEGATE. That hurts.
>Viebranz: CLOZ E4 COLZ. +32 32
>Steve_: AEILSTW 7G WAIL +23 33
#note Duck likes WIZ. Understandable. It's another error, but not as monumental as the last one. Fourteen games still to annotate, and I'm banking that I've already seen my biggest blunder. Then again, I'm not betting the house.
>Viebranz: IIIII -IIIII +0 32
#note George exchanged five tiles.
>Steve_: BEISTTY K3 BYTES +28 61
#note BITSY a couple of points better.
>Viebranz: AJOT 3I JA.OT +44 76
>Steve_: BHIINOT 4B BIT.HIN +30 91
#note Confusing it with BITCHEN. I get lucky to not lose a turn here.
>Viebranz: KST N2 TSK +29 105

>Viebranz: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 143
#note George exchanges five tiles.
>Steve_: ADELPRU N6 PAL +26 236
#note I settled on this play thinking it balanced defensive and offensive traits. It would have been nice to have seen PADRE, which scores 38, enough to try and outrun George to the finish. Q likes UP at 3F.
>Viebranz: ACEORST 10H COASTER. +64 207
#note RECOATS at D8 is worth 13 additional points.
>Steve_: DDERRUU H10 .RUDER +30 266
#note I wanted a spot to play RUDDER, but I too miss the hook sitting at D8. But Q likes this play or CURDED better, anyway.
>Viebranz: EEINNRV 13A INNERVE. +76 283
#note Bangos hurt. Ouch.
>Steve_: ADEOUUV A12 V.ED +36 302
#note Another "Wow" revelation from the duck. Best is UVULAE at 6b, leaving open the hot spot and prioritizing the leave. I wonder how many experts there are who would have made that play. Richards? Gibson? Cap? Even if you see the option, that's a hard trigger to pull. Yet it has a 30 percent win percentage to 25 for VIED. BTW, DEVOU(R) at 11c is second best, and wins 28 times out of 100.
>Viebranz: FI 7C FI. +19 302
>Steve_: ADEOOUU L8 AU.OED +16 318
#note In an even heat with OUTDO in the same spot. Exchanging and keeping ED is only a couple of percentage points behind these plays, 37-35.
>Viebranz: ?GIMNOT 15D MOTo.ING +63 365
#note First blank shows up in the bottom of the 10th. With just six tiles left in the bag after George replenishes his rack it's easy to realize he's favored to get the other one, too.
>Steve_: DEHOOUU 3F UH +23 341
#note ruh-roh. This and SHOO k10 both have win percentages of 12. I saw SHOE, but not SHOO. My hope was to block the easy Q spot and get lucky to stick him with Mr. Squiggly.
>Viebranz: EFN M12 FEN +23 388
>Steve_: DEOORUY N13 YOU +23 364
>Viebranz: IQ 6B QI +36 424
>Steve_: DELOR L2 D.E +18 382
#note Didn't know LOOED, which scores 14 more, but it's academic now.
>Viebranz: ?ANPR 12D PA +18 442
>Steve_: LOR 11J LO. +12 394
#note Two missed out plays, which I attribute to time pressure.
>Viebranz: ?NR 14C aR +10 452
