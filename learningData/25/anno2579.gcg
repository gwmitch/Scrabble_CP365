#note I thought I should save the Y for row 4, but I guess she'll probably score there anyway.

#note I didn't see YETI, but I thought I may as well score some points. Are plays like YOGI 10C or SUINT 7E (which I didn't know) actually better?? I might play YETI, but I don't thinkI woul really go for any of Quackle's other top plays.

#note I see that it is better to play these letters as UNITER, but why does IRONE dominate the sim? Weird.

#note FOLIOUS is sweet! I wish I knew it.

>Noah: EGIOOPR 9N OI +6 428
#note I wanted to block all bingos (except for nines, which I doubted she would find) and leave some in the bag. This seemed the best way to do it.
>Chris_Mazucca: ?AQT J2 QuA.T +35 274
>Noah: EEGOPRR L12 PRO +24 452
#note I'm close, but ROP(E) M2 is even better because it blocks my opponent's major spot and still sets up a high scoring play.
>Chris_Mazucca: ILNRV M2 LIV.R +16 290
#note I wouldn't have thought OIL 14L was actually better, but it is! I wouldn't ever have played it. It is only one point better, though.
