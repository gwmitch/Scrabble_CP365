#note Admittedly a weird exchange. I probably should have just kept the highly synergistic IN. -1
>Mark: ADIRT 8H TRIAD +16 16
>Evans: EEHINNS 9K HEN +15 15
#note Missing ENSHRINE. What is it about playing Mark that makes me miss bingos I obviously know? -34

#note I didn't see KEA 9G, but I'm not sure that I like it anyway. What's so great about the ADGIR leave? -2ish
>Mark: AAMNT 12A MANTA +26 78
>Evans: ACGIRTW C8 CAWI.G +26 150
#note I wrote CAWING and WRING down on my scoresheet and mulled over the values of the leaves ACT and RT. I guessed wrong. -2
>Mark: FIMTU N6 MUFTI +25 103
>Evans: LNRRTTV -LRTV +0 150
#note The only non-trade worth considering is 14G VERT. That looks awful, and the sim agrees. As for which exchange to make, I'm not too sure. Keeping NRT seemed right to me because of the open E in row 14 -- given the pool, I thought I could draw a TONIER? bingo or something. Q prefers two consonants to three; keeping RT sims best. -1
>Mark: AP O7 PA +31 134
>Evans: ?ELNORT L5 RON..LETs +68 218
#note RETINOLS 15A is three points better. This play is best because of the Nine Style Points. NSP > EP every time, right?
>Mark: GJO K4 JOG +29 163
>Evans: ELOOOXY I13 OXO +25 243
#note XYLEM! Statically only a six-point error, but not taking out the TWS when I get the chance is really awful. -8

>Mark: V 14G V.. +13 203
>Evans: EEIOSST 12A .....S +20 290
#note Pretty bad. I have no idea what compelled me to fish with a leave of EEIOST. I really like OE B14 on second thought --  EISST is much better. -9

>Evans: ABEGILT J11 .ELT +27 343
#note Statically this is -6. The sim seems to favor a play in column M hooking OR to make ORB -- GIB, GLIB, GIBE, GAB, etc. A two-ply sim has me at -7 here; CP puts me -3 behind GLIB. I suppose I could have kept a better leave than ABGI, although I do like points. This move isn't too terrible.
>Mark: BFLU M2 FLUB +23 340
>Evans: ABGIISU E5 ABU. +12 355
#note I'm under extreme time pressure at this point -- under 30 seconds, if I recall correctly. IBIS C2 dominates the sim -- it keeps AGU, which both keeps the U in case the Q is in the bag and keeps a balanced leave for going out next turn if I don't draw the Q. Good move -- I wish I'd had time to find it. Luckily I can still win.
>Mark: DOQ 7D Q.OD +29 369
>Evans: EGIIS 2M .IG +14 369
#note Best! I found an unblockable win with 9 seconds on my clock, yay!
