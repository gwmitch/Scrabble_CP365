>Jeremy: ADEINPT 8D PAINTED +76 76
#note best.  I like games that start with a choice of bingos.  Like Quackle, I had DEPAINT as a first choice, but after mental simulations, PAINTED seemed best.
>Sid: ABN 9C BAN +14 14
>Jeremy: FHRRRUZ I4 FURZ. +27 103
#note FUHR(E)R I4 edges out my play in win percent, but my play is the equity winner.
>Sid: NN 5H N.N +3 17
>Jeremy: ?EHRRWY 10D YEW +28 131
#note I forget that opening triple lanes while holding a blank is often beneficial. 10A WHY is the play.  -11.3 equity.  Seems a tad harsh, but I didn't keep a vowel.
>Sid: ILL 4I .ILL +16 33
>Jeremy: ?EHORRY M2 HOY +29 160
#note Sometimes the leave says it all; "ERR?".  Yes, error.  Bingos missed here are HEROnRY and ORpHREY.  I forget the FILLE hook, so I turn down HERRY which is the best non-bingo.  -32.2 equity loss.  M3 HEROnRY is best.
>Sid: AAN 1M ANA +19 52
>Jeremy: ?EGHNRR 6G HE.N +16 176
#note 13.1 equity.  J2 GR(IN) is best.  I've burned over half my time now looking for unplayable bingos.
>Sid: GO 2M .OG +21 73
>Jeremy: ?DEGIRR N1 ..R +5 181
#note 4.3 equity.  1K GR(ANA) is best.
>Sid: IMS K2 MI.S +20 93
>Jeremy: ?DEGIOR 9I DOGgIER +85 266
#note Legal bingos are 11F ERGODIc, 11F ERODInG, and 2D IDEOGRa(M).  My bingo is okay (better equity play than legal moves), but *FURZED is a phony and I know it.  This was a time savings move.  Sid was putting me under time pressure.
>Sid: CO O7 CO. +15 108
>Jeremy: ?AABIUV K9 .UAVA +18 284
#note 7A VAU. -7.0 equity
>Sid: LX N8 L.X +28 136
>Jeremy: ?BIMOUW 11E WOMB +41 325
#note best
>Sid: IOTT 12F TOIT +20 156
>Jeremy: ?AIIISU O7 ...IA +16 341
#note The leave is the pits, but Quackle agrees.  Best.
>Sid: ADEEGOT 12K .OE +12 168
>Jeremy: ?FIISSU M11 F.US +14 355
#note 6M IFS. -10.9 equity.  All plays here have a 100% win.  I'm playing for spread now.
>Sid: DEK H11 ..KED +36 204
>Jeremy: ?AEIIJS 14E AJE. +27 382
>Sid: ACERV 15A CRAVE +44 248
>Jeremy: ?EIILOS 7F OI +12 394
#note 7K OLEI(C) has highest equity. -4.6 equity
>Sid: U 2J U. +6 254
>Jeremy: ?DEIILS 13H .I +10 404
#note ideally, I want to avoid that Q, and play a bingo.  Quack likes 6M IDS for equity on Many play.  My play is back -2.8 points.
>Sid: ET 14M .ET +6 260
>Jeremy: ?DEGILS 2I G.. +6 410
#note objective is still to avoid the Q, keep I in case I get it, and try to bingo out.  Quack says 2I S(UM).  My G(UM) is -18.0 points back on Many Ply.  There is no need to block the U as nothing Sid has will play there.
>Sid: ERT 13C RET +9 269
>Jeremy: ?DEILPS 12A PLED +28 438
#note Championship Player picks 7L SPI(C).  Valued at 58 points.  My play PLED is valued at 43 points on Many ply.  -15 equity points.
>Sid: EQRST 14J ES +14 283
>Jeremy: ?IS 7M SI. +17 455
#note -1 equity point.  I should play the blank first on the DLS, and save the real S for S(ILEX) on the TLS for the extra point.
>Sid: QRT G6 ...T +8 291
>Jeremy: ? N6 s.... +11 466
#note best.  Not a gem of a game by any means. Total 115 equity points lost over 18 turns.  Thats -6.38 per turn.
>Jeremy:  (QR) +22 488
