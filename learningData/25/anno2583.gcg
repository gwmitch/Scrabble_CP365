>Jeremy: ADEIRTY 8F DIETARY +80 80
#note After two morning coffees and three lunchtime coffees, this takes me 0.0001 seconds to slam down.  Yay for luck.
>Evan: AEPQRTU G4 PRAT.QUE +80 80
#note Oh man, it's going to be one of those games
>Jeremy: AEOSUVZ 12A ZOUAVES +128 208
#note Boom-shalack-a-lack-a boom.  How terribly unfair this is to the Boom King. I don't want to get too cocky now because there are still two blanks unseen, and with Evan, this game isn't over.
>Evan: EFIOX K3 FOXIE. +32 112
#note noting that Q,Z,X have come out in consecutive turns, Evan jokes, next you play the J.
>Jeremy: EEIIJLU E10 JI.E +28 236
#note I oblige.  Best is 3K (F)UJI my first instinct. -5.3 equity. I don't feel like enabling a hot S hook, but then again that Z is wide open.
>Evan: NOO A12 .OON +39 151
>Jeremy: EEILPRU L2 PERI +30 266
#note Drat. He blocked my childish bingo.  I'm not sure what imaginary force led me to believe that playing off my best four letter leave was a good strategy.  H1 PULI is best.  -5.4 equity.  I didn't want to hand out points at this stage so I'm being a bit conservative with my play.
>Evan: ADI M1 AID +26 177
>Jeremy: BCEELUU H1 CUBE +32 298
#note best.  The initial adrenaline shot is wearing off around here, but my math is still atrocious.
>Evan: GINOR 14C GIRON +23 200
>Jeremy: ?AAELMT 15F MALTAsE +83 381
#note it's very close.  Quackle likes my play the best after 500 sims.  MALeATE is better by 0.6 valuation points, but down 0.01% win percent.  A8 META(ZOON) keeping the blank is 1.6 valuation points better, but also down 0.01% win percent.  I'll take the -1.6 equity penalty because it's so close.  Evan suggested that MALATEs might have been best because there is no S hook.  See what happens next.
>Evan: CEIORSV M9 VOICERS +91 291
>Jeremy: AABEHMT 14J HAA. +31 412
#note I am not even looking at -ZOON extensions.  META(ZOON) is best by a mile.  I chose HAAR just to block a rich 5 letter word line.  -31.4 equity.  Yech.
>Evan: IK F6 KI. +36 327
>Jeremy: BDEEMNT I2 MEND +22 434
#note -4.3 equity.  Best is J7 B(A)DMEN.  I'm starting to get a little worried about the open C at 1H.
>Evan: GGLNO 11J OGL.NG +16 343
>Jeremy: ABESSTT E4 BAST +22 456
#note N1 BASSETT locks up the game.  I thought it was a proper noun.  Even so N1 BAST is the best nonbingo.  -67.3 equity.
>Evan: WW J10 W.W +17 360
>Jeremy: DEFLSTT O11 .LEDS +24 480
#note best.  Block the 3x3x lane and preserve the win.  Best in valuation, although Quackle puts 6J F(I)L ahead in win percent.
>Evan: ?ENO A8 ENtO.... +48 408
#pay attention here, this has a creative endgame for me.
>Jeremy: FIRTTUY 1M .T +2 482
#note Evan sees my bingo through a U before I finish drawing new tiles.  My play here is best.
>Evan: HLN C11 L.N. +10 418
>Jeremy: FIRTUY O1 TURFY +54 536
#note best.  115.3 equity loss on the game.  Most due to a bingo miss.
>Evan: H 6J H. +13 431
>Evan:  (I) +2 433
