>Dan_Stock: FGLO 8F FLOG +16 16
>Pete: AGHPRVZ -GHPV +0 0
#note Duck likes PARVO best.  For so few points, and drawing at three consonants, no thanks.  I like the exchange here.
>Dan_Stock: DPY H7 D.PY +10 26
>Pete: AINRUYZ F8 .IZ +35 35
#note Missed NAZIFY and ZAYIN, buy they are only slightly better.  
>Dan_Stock: III -III +0 26
>Pete: ANNRSUY 10H .AY +17 52
#note At this point, I'm not liking this game.  Duck says burn the S here.  It's probably right; after his exchange, turnover makes sense.  UNSAY is Duck's favorite.  YAY finishes 11.5 points behind.  Bad error
>Dan_Stock: AEEINRT 11I RETINAE +71 97
#note And I pay.  
>Pete: NNOORSU O8 ROU.N +18 70
#note He puts an E in the middle of the triple line,and I'm helpless.  ROUEN finishes .1 behind NEURON... I'll take the tenth of a point equity loss for the slightly better leave.  
>Dan_Stock: DEFI M9 FI.ED +26 123
>Pete: HINOOSV L6 VINO +13 83
#note As bad as my tiles have been, at this point, I'm thinking "it could be much worse."  Unfortunately, By drawing into NOS was less than inspiring.  My blanking on YEH (yeah, I suck) meant I missed the best play.  I still like VINO... good leave, and it opens the board up while I'm trailing.  
>Dan_Stock: EJKO 12F JOKE +23 146
>Pete: ADHIMOS 13F OH +27 110
#note I was bitter about the lack of an open L, as I learned HALIDOMS just this week.  I decide, unwisely it seems, against OHIA, as I'd not had much luck drawing into 3 consonants.  OH scores a little less, but ADIMS is a leave I'll play to.  If I draw an E,pretty much all of the one point consonants hit. 
>Dan_Stock: ISW J6 WIS +23 169
>Pete: ACDIIMS 5H IMID +21 131
#note Didn't know IMIDIC.  IMID finished just behind.  At this oint, I finally realized I had yet to draw an E.  I was stunned to still be in this one.
>Dan_Stock: MU 4H MU +18 187
>Pete: AACRSTU 14B CARATS +38 169
#note My play finishes only behind ACARUS 3H, which I should have deduced from ACARI.  CARATS does score well and doesn't leave a big comeback, like CARAT would in the same place.  And with a six tile draw and 8 E's unseen, I'm bound to get one, right?
>Dan_Stock: ?ELNRST 3G SaLTERN +76 263
#note sheesh.
>Pete: ABHRTUV 2F VAR +21 190
#note And the bag continues to be a hater.  Duck likes BUHR, which I saw, but I didn't want to kill the line.  HURT was another option, but I thought it was a bit aggressive, despite the deficit.  BURA is probably the play I should have picked... stupid me.
>Dan_Stock: QT C13 Q.T +24 287
#note so much for that line...
>Pete: BHOOPTU 2K POUT +20 210
#note You have to be kidding me.  BOOTH is one of many better plays... I reached the point here that I was getting stupid, out of sheer anger.
>Dan_Stock: AGNW 1L GNAW +41 328
>Pete: BGHINOS 9E B. +4 214
#note BIRO finishes just barely above a few fishes.  I figure it gives up the game... BI opens a line I can theoretically use for a miracle comeback, or at worst, maybe HONGI for a good score and a new line... BOD 13K wins sim at 1.17% for reasons passing understanding
>Dan_Stock: EL 10D LE. +16 344
>Pete: GHINOST 11C NOG +22 236
#note NOG was a no brainer for me.... I needed an S hook, and NOG creates a decent one.
>Dan_Stock: AACEI N4 AECIA +15 359
>Pete: ABHIOST F12 ...A +11 247
#note and of course, the bingo I catch doesn't fit. I fish for an E, with 5 unseen (and a blank) out of 11... maybe?  Just once? Puh-leeese?  BAH o3 wins sim, winning just over 10%.  JOTA, less than .5%.  Ouch.
>Dan_Stock: EE K11 .EE +3 362
#note well, there's a couple of them
>Pete: ?BHIOST B5 BOTHIeS +68 315
#note I miss HOBBITS.  Find BOTHIES.  Unfortunately, fishing the B is the right play, winning 40% of the time. (although I don't see it.  to win, I need to bingo and catch opp with the X.  LOX is bloody obvious, and HIOSTX? only makes 1 8, ETHOXIES.)  BOTHIES did win me 10 bucks for high B play.  and it drew a challenge, which helped my spread.
>Dan_Stock: DEEELRU -  +0 362
#note essentially a free challenge, costing only spread.  
>Pete: X D10 ..X +20 335
#note and I manage to lose a game by 11, without an E.  This was frustrating but educational... it shows that no matter how ugly the racks are, there are winning chances available (usually).  I give up on games like this a bit too easily, and I really have to keep my composure and keep fighting.
