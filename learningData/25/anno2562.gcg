#note the female donkey is best. 14F JE(n)NY.  I saved JENNY for next turn thinking I wasn't going to bingo next, and the J had more potential. -8.o equity
>Mark: AHIOSST 12E SHO.TIAS +72 234
#note I held this.  To be honest I didn't know if SHORTIA took an S so I thought about it for a minute.
>Jeremy: EIJNNTY E2 JI.EY +36 238
#note I wrote JENNY a dozen times on my score sheet.  I'm not sure how I ended up playing this instead.  With two open G's on the board keeping IN has to be good. -16.2 equity.  I am retarded.
