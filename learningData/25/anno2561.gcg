>Jeremy: ?CIJNRR 8G JIN +20 20
#note best.  Not much variety really.  JIN or exchange.
>SamH: EOTV 9F VOTE +24 24
>Jeremy: ?LLNRRT -LLR +0 20
#note.  There are lots of good exchanges that sim within 1 point.  Quackle likes exch. LLRRT best keeping just N?. -0.8 equity.
>SamH: AAEEGLS -AAEEG +0 24
>Jeremy: ?ANORTT H7 T..RATiON +77 97
#note I put down T(IT)RATiON.  Pick it up.  Put down ATTORNs pick it up, put down RATTONs, pick it up, and go back to T(IT)RATiON.  T(IT)RATiON is just one point better, but strings the board wide open to bingos.  This is what I decide will be best against an opponent I feel I have better bingo knowledge against.  -1.5 equity points, done intentionally.
>SamH: AEEIRST 12D TREA.IES +66 90
#note well, he would have bingoed anyway.
>Jeremy: EKMQRRU 11J MERK +28 125
#note Mark Przbzthbltzprtlptzwzski (sitting beside me watching) asked after the game why I didn't play J10 QUEER.  I forget why I didn't, but he's absolutely right.  I have the K hook for JINK later, so K isn't so bad to keep.  Plus QU(E)ER is points.  At the time I really wasn't in the mood to discuss the game, so I just let him scold me and bit my lip while I packed up the game. -8.2 equity.
>SamH: AEIU E10 AU.EI +10 100
>Jeremy: CGGQRUY J11 ..RCY +18 143
#note If I had drawn some vowels, I'd be taking a 40 point turn here -- but I didn't, which makes keeping the QU look even stupider.  Quackle likes 14C GR(I)G.  Ditch consonants.  -5.1 equity.  
>SamH: AEM M11 .AME +20 120
>Jeremy: EGGLOQU N12 GEL +19 162
#note 14A LOGG(I)E sims best in win%.  7H TOGGLE is best in valuation.  My play is at a -8 point equity loss.
>SamH: ?AELOOS O7 AErOSOL +81 201
>Jeremy: DGHOOQU N8 HOG +24 186
#note neat.  I have QUOHOG but I can't play it.  Quackle like N8 OOH keeping consonant heavy leave DGQU.  My play is only -0.7 points back.
>SamH: ANOX J5 AXON +38 239
>Jeremy: ADIOQUW K3 QUAI +39 225
#note I have bingos to score, so I decide it's time to chuck that damn Q.  Quackle likes K3 WADI for 8 less keeping OQU back.  -1.9 equity.
>SamH: IPZ L2 ZIP +47 286
>Jeremy: BDEORVW I3 WEB +17 242
#note I really only have a bingo line at column D.  This is a board opening move, laying a decoy for Sam to cash in that TWS, in hopes of giving me a second line when he does.  The problem is keeping DORV isn't going to bingo very often, but often a play from H1 will set up my V for some points.  Quackle takes the points at 14B BOV(I)D keeping much better tiles.  -15.3 equity.
>SamH: ADDE H1 DEAD +34 320
>Jeremy: DHIIORV G3 VOID +29 271
#note My play is tied with 14A VIRO(I)D.  I kind of prefer VIROID for making the board more volatile.
>SamH: DU 1F DU. +5 325
>Jeremy: BEFGHIR 2L .IG +26 297
#note botched this one.  I can't bingo keeping so many clunkers.  G11 F(A)B is the play keeping EGHIR.  My play is -1.0 point back.
>SamH: FL F12 .LF +29 354
>Jeremy: BEFHORT D4 BEFROTH +87 384
>Jeremy: BEFHORT --  -87 297
#note I get creative here and make up a word.  If it stays, Quackle says I win 61.65% of the time, which makes it hard for Sam to pull the trigger.  He holds the play for what seems like an eternity, and makes the correct choice.  The best legal play was 4C FORB(ODE). -36.5 equity points, but no regrets.  That was my bid for the win, and it was foiled.
>SamH: AELNNRT D4 LANTERN +68 422
>Jeremy: BEFHORT 8B RO. +3 300
#note Low on time, I can't find a way to set up a triple triple, so I set up a big hook hoping for carnage on my next turn.  Hopefully I can recoup some spread points.  -24.8 equity.  8A HEB(E) is best.  Just take the points.  Don't get fancy.
>SamH: CSY B6 SC.Y +11 433
>Jeremy: BEFHNPT C3 FEH +25 325
#note 7A E(C)H(T) is the play.  I can salvage a big F play after all if I do that.  Too little time to thing about it.  -26 equity.
>SamH: IISUW M1 W.S +36 469
>Jeremy: BNPT 5C ..P +16 341
#note best at this point.  I've already done the damage to botch this game.
>SamH: IIU 8G ....I +12 481
>Jeremy: BNT 9A B. +7 348
#note 11G B(A) is one more. -1 equity.
>SamH: IU 6F I. +5 486
>Jeremy: NT 8M T.. +6 354
#note best.
>SamH: U M7 U. +3 489
