#note Sims best, although OUTLAY and LAYOUT are close.

#note PUNG is better, obviously. -5
>Rod: ?DHRRSV M7 ..RD +6 159
#note Interesting play -- sets up an S hook and keeps an HRSV? leave that is in business if he can draw a vowel. Quackle prefers exchanging, but this play has its merits.
>Evans: ADEGIJX 2J JA..ED +64 219
>Rod: ?EEHRSV O8 .EVERiSH +101 260
#note Best. Nice find.
>Evans: GGIINXY B13 XI +27 246
#note I like this better than the higher-scoring N13 placement because it keeps bingo lanes open. Quackle disagrees. -2
>Rod: ANOW O1 A.OWN +39 299
>Evans: CEGGINY 14J YINCE. +38 284
#note Wow, I feel stupid. Not only is this phony, but it's 10 points worse than just playing YINCE at A4.
>Rod: ENOVW 15G WOVEN +40 339
>Evans: AEGGQRR A5 RAGE +21 305
#note I missed the slightly better row 13 spot, where some nifty overlaps offer GAGER, EGGAR and AGGER. My play sims 6 back -- even behind GAGE in the same spot, which is strange because I like un-doubling consonants.
>Rod: DOS L12 DO.S +25 364
>Evans: CDGNQRT -CDGNR +0 305
#note Admittedly, this was a very weird exchange, but I desperately wanted to score with the Q. I kept QT because I there were two I's for QI A14 44 and two A's for QAT14F 39. Quackle prefers keeping just an N, presumably to dig for AEINST bingos? I dunno. -3
>Rod: BI C6 BI +8 372
#note Good thinking.
>Evans: AEEEQST 14F QAT +39 344
>Rod: D G13 D.. +9 381
>Evans: EEEGRST 5A .E +2 346
#note I asked Rod about this play later, and he seemed to like it. Basically, we agreed that it was either make this really lame fish or admit defeat on the spot. If I want to give up on winning, the spread play is EGO 13J for 14 keeping EERST, but I'd rather take my chances.
>Rod: AEINRST 4B ANESTRI +68 449
#note Oh well.
>Evans: EEGRSTZ J7 .EEZ +34 380
#note This was kinda dumb... seeing as he's C-stuck, why not play GEE first, take the free 4 points, and then drop the Z? Oh well... time pressure's my excuse here. I had taken a lot of time thinking about my fish last turn.
