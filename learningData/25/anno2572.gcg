#note 7H AA edges out four different exchanges. My exchange is best of them.

>Matthew: ACENNUZ 7H NUANCE +16 16
#note Soooo proud of this play. Looked bleak with only two spots on the board that I am able to play on, but I make a play that turns over 6 tiles AND sets up my Z. Kismet would have me draw into an A for my genius.
>Winter: ERX 8M REX +32 75
>Matthew: EMOSSUZ J6 Z. +31 47
#note I just did a /facepalm. I must have been asleep to not tack on the extra S for 14 more points. Jeez Louise.
>Winter: EFILPR M3 PILF..ER +28 103

>Winter: ADHL 1H DHAL. +27 130
>Matthew: BEEKORS -  +0 79
#note Challenged. I swear I'd never seen that word before. And I've read through all the fours a billion times. I thought he was just stumbling on DAHLS. No idea there was an anagram there.
>Winter: ADENT K5 TA.NED +25 155
>Matthew: BEEKORS L9 KORE +27 106
#note Geez. N2 KOB sims better by quite a bit. I wanted to open the board up, not make a a play that gives Winter an easy comeback if he has an N.
>Winter: DEINORT 12F ORIENT.D +60 215
>Matthew: ?BEGLOS 11B BOgGLES +74 180

>Matthew: EIJOPVW A14 JO +36 216
#note Slightly edged out by 2J WO(W).
>Winter: AE C13 AE +22 253

>Matthew: AEIIPRR 8A AIR. +12 243
#note Good thing my bingo didn't play, because I wasn't seeing it for some reason. Hopefully I would have if there were a spot for it, though. AIRT sims second behind 13I RAI. Both accomplish the same thing.
