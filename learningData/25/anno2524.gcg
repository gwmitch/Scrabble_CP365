>Matthew: ADEGIMS G9 MIG +19 19
#note Hey, there we go! A high-prob miss! DEGAMIS hasn't entered my cardbox yet, but I vaguely remember having seen it before. Most good players have this word down, I imagine.
>Su_Edwards: EKNOT I4 TOKEN +18 36
>Matthew: AADENSU 11E AU.ENDS +36 55
#note Oh my God. Another miss. SAUNAED is one I have not added to my bingo box yet, but I took a look at the DNS+vowels bingos just last week in preparation for adding them. Damn damn damn. No excuse for that miss. Crappity crap.
>Su_Edwards: ABETU H1 BEAUT +29 65
>Matthew: AALRRUZ 12A LAZAR +32 87
#note Feels good to make the right play at last, even though it seems to look so wrong.
>Su_Edwards: AAM 13A AMA +38 103
>Matthew: BENRTUV H11 .VENT +36 123
#note I miss the chance to snag the other 2v2. BUT(TO)NER is another miss.
>Su_Edwards: CLO C9 COL.. +19 122
>Matthew: ?BEORRU 2A BOURtRE. +72 195
#note Three bingos from the T are better. TRUEBORN and TABOURER aren't known to me, but TROUBLER should have been easy. Gotta love the weirdness of my choice, though. Especially against a non-expert.
>Su_Edwards: EHX -  +0 122
#note Challenged. Try to solve my next rack. There is one star play.
>Matthew: EFNPRWY A11 F..WY +42 237
#note Woo! I found the star play! Nothing else is close. It took forever, though. I spent minutes trying to find the move the went through LA and spent two high-point consonents. *PLANY, *FLARY... something's gotta work! I found the one that spends my three ugliest tiles.
>Su_Edwards: EHX -  +0 122
#note Challenged.
>Matthew: EEINOPR K4 PEREION. +70 307
#note My nice leave is rewarded, and the rout is on.
>Su_Edwards: EHX L3 HEX +43 165
>Matthew: DEIITUW -WUDII +0 307
#note Ugh. I don't know why I would pass tiles when such easy points are available in column M. Weak, weak play.
>Su_Edwards: AIQ C1 Q.AI +26 191
>Matthew: DEILRST 13G R.LISTED +72 379
#note Even when I'm bingoing, I'm making the wrong move. (B)RISTLED, duh!
>Su_Edwards: AH M3 AH +28 219
>Matthew: ?EGNOPT A2 .OP +10 389
#note GENOTyP(E)! GOdP(AR)ENT! But LMAO... my play sims higher than both! So... erm... I saw them but meant to pass them up. Yes.
>Su_Edwards: DII D1 I.ID +32 251

>Matthew: ?EGNORT 15C REGOT.eN +59 465
>Matthew: ?EGNORT --  -59 406
#note ROeNTGEN blocked. BURGONET and TETRAGON missed. Phony played.
>Su_Edwards: EITU L12 E.UI +10 275
>Matthew: ?EGNORT 3L ..G +7 413
#note I guess I missed BURGONET this bingo too. I should learn that word.
>Su_Edwards: IS 14A .IS +39 314
#note Ok... I think I can bingo with this next rack.
>Matthew: ?ENORST O3 SENaTOR +79 492
