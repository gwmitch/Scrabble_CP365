>Alex_Fiszbein: DGHKOOR 8F GROK +18 18
>Jason: EEEFINO F6 FO.IE +19 19
#note Was vacillating on dessert, looked at the menu and saw a Coke float and knew I had to have one. It didn't disappoint.
>Alex_Fiszbein: DEHHMOW E4 WHOM +33 51
>Jason: ABEEINS D4 AE +19 38
#note OMG! How on God's green earth did I miss the hook?!?! Talk about brainlock!
>Alex_Fiszbein: ADEHMOY C2 YODH +38 89
>Jason: ABBEINS B1 EBB +32 70
#note Counted as 31. Oops.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEMOQVW E10 WOVE +25 114
>Jason: AILNOST 13C TO.NAILS +70 140
#note After Alex hit his clock, I said "This rack should look familiar." :) Championship Player says I'm incorrect in eschewing the nine points for LATINOS/(WOVE)N in favor of safety.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEEIMQR 14B QI +24 138
>Jason: ??DILLO 15A LILO +29 169
#note Comparable to all bingos except hILLOeD at 15A for 85. This is only 73.5. The luckboxing begins.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AEEMRST J2 REMATES +73 211
>Jason: ??DEIRR 1I acRIDER +80 249
#note Wasn't 100% on DECRIER, the only other 80-pointer.
>Alex_Fiszbein: CEGJTUU H11 JU.CE +45 256
#note This seems like a good time to mention that Alex has lost 3.6 equity points total, all on turn 3 (HOMY).
>Jason: ACNNNSX K4 AX +40 289
#note I felt good having looked at ACSX until I saw NNN. But wait, luckboxing will ensue. (Somehow counted as 42. I'm blaming it all on the fact that it was like 1 a.m.)
>Alex_Fiszbein: DEGINTU 11H .UTE +22 278
>Jason: AACNNNS A1 NAAN +34 323
#note Do I have a better two-tile pick than AA there? I say no. Don't say AO; it doesn't play anyway.
>Alex_Fiszbein: DEGINST 10I NIDGETS +72 350
#note Missing ING(E)STED and SIGN(E)TED along row 3.
>Jason: ACEINSU 15H .UCAINES +83 406
#note OMG, I had a trip-trip! IS(S)UANCE! I was even more of a luckbox than I realized! But seriously, AEIU into CNS? Why can't this happen more often? I then threatened Alex if he bingoed.
>Alex_Fiszbein: EFLNPTZ L4 PELF +42 392
>Jason: ADGITUV O7 VUG. +24 430
#note Wasn't sure of VAGU(S). Speedy likes this better anyway, but I hated emptying on the number.
>Alex_Fiszbein: AINRTYZ F2 ZIN +40 432
#note Easily best.
>Jason: ADIOPRT 14K APOD +28 458
#note For whatever reason, I thought PAROTOID fit. This, PADI and PAID are my wins.
>Alex_Fiszbein: ARTY D8 TRAY +19 451
#note Super-fun game. 3-3 on the night (should've been 4-2), him 5-1 on the night (should've been 4-2).
>Alex_Fiszbein:  (IRT) +6 457
