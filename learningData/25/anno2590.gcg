>Matthew: BENOOWY 8G BOYO +18 18
#note EBONY obviously better.
>Rebecca_Lampert: AGZ 7F ZAG +22 22
>Matthew: AEHNNTW 6G WAN +18 36
#note I'm trying to remember why I didn't tack the T on. I must have had a reason.
>Rebecca_Lampert: ILT J4 LIT +14 36
>Matthew: EHINTUX 9J XU +18 54
#note I'm not sure what this play is trying to accomplish. I make a fish, yet at the same time close the board up. What am I thinking? I was probably tired.
>Rebecca_Lampert: AAII 4H AA.II +12 48
>Matthew: EGHIMNT 3H HM +22 76
#note METH two spots over sims a bit better.
>Rebecca_Lampert: FLT K2 FL.T +18 66
>Matthew: EGHIINT J1 HI +14 90
#note Playing too aggressively on a board that isn't going to let me bingo anyways.
>Rebecca_Lampert: EGIN 1F NEIG. +27 93
#note And I give up free points.
>Matthew: EEGINTY 10H GEY +36 126
#note Make a right play for once.
>Rebecca_Lampert: EEJ 2D JEE +16 109
>Matthew: ACEEINT C2 ANTIC +25 151
#note Doesn't make Q's initial top plays, but sims pretty close to the top. EJECTA is best. I don't like keeping EE, but it's worth it to make such a board-closing play, I think. I'm prepared to nickel and dime my way to a win if I have to. Just gotta block that AALII hook next turn...
>Rebecca_Lampert: ?ELORST M2 cOSTREL +70 179
#note Bollocks.
>Matthew: ADEEENQ D2 .EAN +30 181
#note Best.
>Rebecca_Lampert: ACP 8L C.AP +33 212
>Matthew: ADEEOQV -ADEOQV +0 181
#note Keeping DE is a bit better, and ADE better than that. Freaking Q.
>Rebecca_Lampert: MORRSU N8 .RMOURS +30 242
>Matthew: EEKNOTT 11E KETON +23 204
#note For a moment, I squint until one of my T's turns into a Y. Then I return to reality and play a phony. Wire crossed with KETOL.
>Rebecca_Lampert: EFN 13L FE.N +14 256
>Matthew: AEESTVW 14I WAVE +17 221
#note Second best. 12K WE is good.
>Rebecca_Lampert: IPRU 12B PURI +18 274
#note Rebecca missing some chances to close the board down and seal up her win.
>Matthew: ADEESTV 5A VE.. +7 228
#note Loses in the sim. I thought it was an okay play. It might distract Rebecca from the better bingo lines. Guess I was wrong.
