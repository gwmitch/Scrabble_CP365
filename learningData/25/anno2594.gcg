>Eugene_d'Eon: EGILOST I13 G.L +13 253

#note 12K IN(N) probaby best by about 23.7.
>Eugene_d'Eon: EFIORST 5C FOE +23 276
#note 12J FIR(N) was my only real hope according to Quackle, but i was done on time and gave up.  a many plies sim puts the loss at around 50, but that's hard to trust so near to the end game.
>Nick_Carter: ??IJNNO 12J JIN. +37 378
#note quackle likes 14N ON better than JIN(N).  by about 50 points.  wow.  JIN(N) seems like a no brainer.
