#note FANwISE would have been cute.

>Steve_: ILQTUYY 2A QU.Y +32 210
#note QUILT/RANI is best, but that would require me to be more alert for hooking possibilties. The error costs 20 points, but just 13 in valuation due to what would have been a YY leave.
>Eric: DGINRS H10 GRINDS +32 107
#note This is how you use a hook; however, I'm glad to see those nice tiles depart Eric's rack six at a time and not seven.
>Steve_: DIILTTY L8 TIDILY +29 239
#note Here I rightly use a hook, but the wrong hook. Making GRANT instead of GRAND with the same play moved down scores five additional points.

#note I found a hook! There is still hope for me.
>Eric: EERT 8L .REE +12 168
>Steve_: CEIJLTT 4B T.IJET +26 369
#note Better to play JITTE(R) in the M column, which I saw, but I'm of the impression Eric is managing bingo prone tiles so I want to set up other scoring lanes.
>Eric: AEKP D10 PEAK +36 204
#note Nice overlap play. Looks like my impression was wrong.
>Steve_: ?AAABCL F10 AA +14 383
#note Didn't know the 99 point bingo that makes the blank an O, but I'm disappointed not to get the maximum for the AA dump. Too lazy to look, I guess.
>Eric: EOSW H1 WOES +39 243
#note Scored as 40 in the actual game. Laziness again.
>Steve_: ?ABCGLO 1D BOG +19 402
#note This missed bingo was only 95 points. Funny thing was, I was disappointed he blocked my potential play of BACkLOG.

>Steve_: ?ACELOO 15M .OO +9 411
>Eric: O E4 .O +18 291
>Steve_: ?ACELNS M2 CLeANE.S +75 486
#note A number of different bingos score more, starting with NuCLEAS(E), or C(O)NcEALS for 80.
