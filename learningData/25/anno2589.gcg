>Matthew: EEEJLTU 8G JEU +20 20
#note Best, but JUTE is very close.
>Steve_Ozorio: ARW I6 WA.R +9 9
>Matthew: EEGLRTT J5 TEG +16 36
#note GET for a point less sims better?
>Steve_Ozorio: CILTU K1 CULTI +18 27
>Matthew: ELOORTT L2 TOOTLER +77 113
>Steve_Ozorio: ABIV 8K B.AVI +30 57
>Matthew: BFFIIQS M7 F.B +24 137
#note BIFF is best. Mine is not as bad as it looks, though.
>Steve_Ozorio: CEY 2J C..EY +32 89
>Matthew: DFIIOQS M1 F.OD +26 163
#note Second to 10K QIS.
>Steve_Ozorio: GO 1M .OG +26 115
>Matthew: HIINQRS O7 Q. +11 174
#note Again, 10K QIS. I gotta admit FABS was looking fishy to me. Didn't want to risk it. Besides, I love was O7 QI does to the board.
>Steve_Ozorio: EU 9I .UE +7 122
>Matthew: ?HIINRS 10D NoIRISH +90 264
>Matthew: ?HIINRS --  -90 174
#note One tile turnover draws into a blank. Lucky. But darn I blocked my own RHINITIS! Anyways, *WAURS is a phony and Steve knows it. It's a shame because I was so proud of NOIRISH.
>Steve_Ozorio: DO H6 OD. +15 137
#note Uh oh. Credit Steve with a fumble there.
>Matthew: ?HIINRS 5B SHINIeR +73 247
>Steve_Ozorio: EO 4D OE +10 147
>Matthew: DHOPRXZ 3A DROP +19 266
#note I passed up the best play N8 VOX. I didn't like the leave. Somehow I liked HXZ, though.
>Steve_Ozorio: EP A1 PE. +18 165
>Matthew: ADHTWXZ 6A WHA +35 301
#note B2 T(R)A(S)H edges out my play.
>Steve_Ozorio: EY A6 .YE +27 192
>Matthew: DNRRTXZ 8A .X +9 310
#note I have to ignore Quackle's advice here, because I don't think it's taking into account that Steve has turned over just two tiles SIX turns in a row. He is bound to be toying with bingo tiles and I want to make the board impossible for him. I like my play and feel I have a good enough lead to justify a leave of DNRRTZ.
>Steve_Ozorio: II -II +0 192
>Matthew: DMNRRTZ C2 M. +4 314
#note Steve has to be holding gold by this point. Seven turns in a row with 2 tile turnover. Again, I justify my ugly play in the name of defence.
>Steve_Ozorio: AI N8 .IA +12 204
>Matthew: DNRRTUZ -DRUNT +0 314
#note I can't put off trading anymore and I don't have a play that doesn't open up the board even more. Q likes 7C DURN, but Steve will surely bingo back.
>Steve_Ozorio: IS 9A SI +21 225
#note This is nine consecutive turns with 2 tiles turned over for Steve.
>Matthew: AEKNNRZ 9A ..ZER +24 338
#note I don't know how SIZAR eluded me, and I don't know how SIZER sims better anyway. This play is best.
>Steve_Ozorio: ?AELLSS F9 SALLiES +75 300
#note I'm not stopping a bingo on that rack.
>Matthew: AIKMNNU 15F .UNK +24 362
#note ANIMUS is the top play I missed.
>Steve_Ozorio: EGINOR C9 .EROING +34 334
#note Ack. Nice set of tiles there. I wonder what his seventh letter was that he didn't have a bingo on this board?
>Matthew: AAAIIMN G10 MAIN +17 379
#note I had completely mistracked. Unseen according to my sheet was AADGINNV. I saw Steve with a 25% chance at INVADING for the win. So I blocked it.
>Steve_Ozorio: ADENNTV O10 TANNED +26 360
#note ADVENT a better play. But yikes. This move was miscounted as 39 in the game. I was sweating more than necessary toward the end, it seems.
>Matthew: AAIT H10 AT +10 389
#note The score I see on my sheet is 378-373, so I take a full 2 minutes to guarantee he has the V, and another 4 minutes to make sure this play sticks him with it.
>Steve_Ozorio: V 13E V.. +5 365
>Steve_Ozorio: V --  -5 360
>Matthew: AI N14 AI +11 400
>Matthew:  (V) +8 408
