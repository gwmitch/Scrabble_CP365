#note best
>Craig: AIN I6 NA.I +15 15
>Jeremy: HIISSTU 10G SUSHI +30 66
#note 10I SHIT -2.3 equity loss.  Second place is 10G TUSH.  Both keep two lousy vowels and an S.
>Craig: ?AIRSUV L4 VARIoUS +77 92
>Jeremy: AEFIMTT K5 FAT +26 92
#note I2 best. FEMI(NAZIS) is pretty cool, but barely makes the top 15.
>Craig: EPT M7 PET +21 113
>Jeremy: EIMOOTT 11E MOOT +16 108
#11E TOOM. -3.5 equity loss.  I couldn't remember for sure if it was good, so I took 2 points less.
>Craig: EIKLOX H1 OXLIKE +56 169
>Jeremy: ?BEFIIT -  +0 108
#note I hold the play.  Craig just blocked BEaTIFI(C) at G1 for 65. I don't really like OXLIKE, so I challenge.  If I'm wrong, I still have a blank in hand. The play stands.  The correct play is 11J IF. -40.9 equity loss for the incorrect challenge.

#note best by a mile
>Craig: DGNR 4F GR.ND +7 198
>Jeremy: ?ABEINT 12B BeTAINE +81 214
#note 1H (O)BTAINEd -8.6 equity. I spotted (O)BTAINEd 1H almost as soon as I hit the clock.  Played this much too quickly.  I was just thrilled about having a 4 tile overlap there.
>Craig: EMNOORT B8 TROM.ONE +78 276
>Jeremy: ADDEEQV N9 EVADED +41 255
#note 15A D(E)AVED -2.4 equity.  Normally I'd have played 15A D(E)AVED, but I think I need a volatile board combined with bad tiles for Craig to go for a win.
>Craig: EHILOO A4 HOOLIE +47 323
>Jeremy: AAELQRW A13 LAW +37 292
#note best, although I really need a U for my Q now and/or an S to slot at O9.  Not great turnover.
>Craig: JU 13M J.U +20 343
>Jeremy: AAEQRRW 3C WARE +20 312
#note B2 AWARE (max turnover to get to U and S) -3.8 equity.
>Craig: DE 4C ED +17 360
>Jeremy: AGNNQRR 2A GNAR +20 332
#note with this draw I'm pretty well sunk.  My play maximizes win percent, and is the top valuation play as well.  About 11.19% to win here.
>Craig: ACESTU O4 ACUTES +31 391
>Jeremy: EGILNQR -  +0 332
#note -26 equity for the challenge.  My only hope is (if I'm not sure on ACUTES to challenge, and then plunk QI at N6.
