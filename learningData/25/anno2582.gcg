>james: ACEIOPR 8G COP +14 14
#note better to score points here - PICARO, COPIER or PACIER.  Even CORIA.
>dave_koenig: UU -UU +0 0
#note this really was the exchange
>james: AEINRST J5 ANESTRI +69 83
#note even i can find a bingo here.

#note best
>dave_koenig: AIMNRST F2 MARTINS +76 86
>james: EGGINUV 3K .UG +22 141
#note this is the second best play.  The best i got nowhere near - H7 V(O)GUEING - also spelled VOGUING apparently.
>dave_koenig: LOW G1 LOW +23 109
>james: EGIILNV 1G .IVING +36 177
#note now this one i did see and consider... i spent a while thinking about it and as i hadn't studied it didn't go with it.  I think against a lower rated player i just go with this.  Again my play is 2nd best after this missed bingo - LIVE(R)ING.  
>dave_koenig: KNO G6 NO.K +21 130
>james: ADEEILV E3 VEAL +32 209
#note the best plays use the N1 or N2 spot with the JUG-A hook.   VIALED, VAILED, VEALED, LEAVED.  Mine is -3% but is better defensively imo.
>dave_koenig: GOO I5 GOO. +20 150
>james: DDDEISU 10D DUDS +21 230
#note DUDDIES obviously came into my head.  It's no good, but DUDDIE is.  Q likes other stuff a little better than mine - I11 DUDE - but that looks crazy to me, as does 9I S(T)UDDIE (not that i knew that one).  I11 DUD i may have played if i had this over.
>dave_koenig: EHNO 11C HONE +24 174
>james: DEEEISZ 12A ZEES +59 289
#note now this is the key move...... the thinking of Q is that it likes 12A ZEES, and so did i.  It also goes with N3 SEIZE/D.  Talking with Dave after he thought that 12b ZEE was better for me. All the win% are >98% here, but that's probably misleading - I'll go with Dave's experience - he's probably right here.
>dave_koenig: ?AEIINT A8 TrIA.INE +194 368
#note this is why maybe sacrificing those 22 extra points may have been worth it.
>james: AADEERR N2 DARER +28 317
#note this is -5% on the win.  13c REDEAR, READER, REREAD are liked the best as they open another lane.   In my spot EARED is better.
>dave_koenig: X C11 ..X +26 394
>james: ACEEOTW 12K AWE +17 334
#note a percentage point behind M6 OWE or M5 WOE.
>dave_koenig: IQ B7 QI +13 407
>james: ABCEOTY 13K BOT +27 361
#note this is not great either.  M5 YOB is best.  L1 (G)OU(T)Y is cute. They're the best.  Mine doesn't really achieve much - even BOTA would be better. it sets up two lanes and  maybe i'd get the blank
>dave_koenig: ILLT C6 TILL +21 428

#note best
>dave_koenig: HTU 8L H.UT +33 461
>james: AACEEMP 14L PAM +25 406
#note at this point i stopped thinking a little - N11 PEACE is certainly the best.
>dave_koenig: ?DEIRRY 15G DRYERs +35 496
#note best
>james: ACEE 14E ACE +14 420
#note 4d C(ER)E is best, which i thought but then 2nd guesssed myself on it.
