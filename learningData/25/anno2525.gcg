#note I'm not sure why this play sims so poorly. Am I being punished for keeping the O? Top plays are J5 OM, M12 MI, and L3 OVERLY.

>Matthew: EILORTW J4 LOW +29 130
#note Close up top with just OW. I like this play because it sets up the S I plan to draw.

>Matthew: AGINRTX 15H TAXIN. +45 244
#note Not bad to take points after oppo's big score, but best is 4D AX. I can see why it would be great defense with a promising (albeit vowel-lite) leave. 37 points to boot. I like closing that G, though.

#note Tops is E2 FETTER... but the GG leave? I might sacrifice the points. (If I see FETTER).

#note Super Lockbox wielding deadly baby bingoes come to commit violent crimes. TINGEING better.

#note Jeez. Fern won't go away, will she?
>Matthew: ABELMOU 7H OM +22 353
#note Best.

>Matthew: ABBEKLU 13G BLAE +24 377
#note Sims okay. Tops is KAB(O)B which I should have seen. BBK on my rack should be setting off all sorts of sirens with those K?B?B words. I like BLAE over BLAB because big consonents are going to win this game, and I like saving the B.

>Matthew: BEEEKQU D10 QU. +12 389
#note Not quite the top sim, which surprised me. The threat of a Q-stick was very real on this board and it was my only way of losing. Am I missing an obvious spot for my Q on a later turn?
