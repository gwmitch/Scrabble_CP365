#note 4J ERA looks best -- scores 19, keeps a decent AEIN, and blocks up the board a little bit with a good lead. Missed it. -5 statically, -8 after simming.

#note Close call between playing VAU 3L or VIRID C3 or making this exchange. The valuation puts the exchange first, keeping AR and digging into a fairly good pool to draw bingos and run up the score, but in terms of winning percentage, VAU is best. Style choice, maybe? I still like my trade here.

#note I thought hard about this. Reasons not to challenge: 1) I can just bingo and outrun him; 2) he must know it's good if he didn't just play OUTSTAY. Reasons to challenge: IT REALLY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A WORD! Oh well. Made the wrong call here.
