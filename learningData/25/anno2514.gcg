>Andy_Saunders: EVX 8G VEX +26 26
>Matthew: ADFILOS 7H FOIL +23 23
#note Obviously a move I made too quickly. And obviously inferior to FID and FIDO.
>Andy_Saunders: DJLOSS L7 SLOJDS +38 64
>Matthew: AADESTY 9I YA +26 49
#note I had a hunch (J)AY would be best, because Andy was likely not holding the last S already. Q tells me my hunch was right. YA is second best.
>Andy_Saunders: KRU 8L .URK +24 88
>Matthew: ADEPSTY J6 P.T. +26 75
#note Haha. I guess I should have kept going with PITAYA. I wish. PITA is not bad. It's behind PITAYA and simply AY.
>Andy_Saunders: ADEHN 11G HANDE. +22 110
>Matthew: ?ADESUY 10L .AY +21 96
#note I had scribbled *DAYSURE on my scoresheet and was sure there was a bingo that looked something like that. However, I was too chicken to pull the trigger. Lucky I didn't, because it's DASYURE and that was the only bingo. A miss, but I credit myself for almost seeing it!
>Andy_Saunders: CEIM 12D MICE +21 131
>Matthew: ?ADEHSU D7 UnSHA.ED +63 159
#note I thought I was missing a pile of bingoes here, but only two play. Best is SUBHEAD at C7 for 81.
>Andy_Saunders: EFIOO 14A FOO.IE +24 155
>Matthew: BILORRT A12 RI.T +24 183
#note Q likes BOR(A)L at 11A? I can't justify leaving that F hotspot open.
>Andy_Saunders: GNOR H11 .RGON +31 186
>Andy_Saunders: GNOR --  -31 155
>Matthew: BILLORZ K3 ZORI. +32 215
>Andy_Saunders: ENOR 3K .ONER +28 183
>Matthew: AABLLNT 15F LAB +17 232
#note Perhaps my lead isn't big enough yet to start blocking lanes? My play isn't bad, but LAB 2L and BLA(ZONER) are best.
>Andy_Saunders: GN N2 G.N +8 191
#note Uh oh... he's fishing.
>Matthew: AAILNTU C3 AULIN +15 247
#note *AULIN. Yikes. I think I got a wire crossed in between AUXIN and AULIC. Hopefully that's my last phony five of the tournament.
>Andy_Saunders: GM C13 M.G +20 211
>Matthew: AEIIOTT O1 TO.AI +24 271
>Matthew: AEIIOTT --  -24 247
#note No joke. I am THAT bad. Felt like a tool the second I hit the clock.
>Andy_Saunders: DG L2 G.D +16 227
>Matthew: AEIIOTT D2 TITI +16 263
#note Quackle wants me to make IO(L)ITE 5A. Alright, how do I input into Quackle that Andy has obviously been building a bingo rack for several turns and is trying desperately to keep the one line open? I like my play best.
>Andy_Saunders: Q 6B Q. +31 258
>Matthew: AEEEOSW O1 WO.E +30 293
#note Precious points.
>Andy_Saunders: EET E3 TEE +18 276
>Matthew: ACEERSW O6 WA.ES +26 319
#note Q likes WAE at 13G. I have to say I thought the biggest threat was a 6-letter S word coming down from JAY rather than a 7 starting at 14G.
>Andy_Saunders: NU F5 UN +8 284
#note Andy spending turns building a bingo rack is hurting him now. His one point tiles losing to my W's.
>Matthew: BCEIPRT 13G PRICE +24 343
#note Didn't make Quackle's list, but immediately sims to the top.
>Andy_Saunders: ?AANORV 14K NOVA +16 300
