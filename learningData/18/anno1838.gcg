>Will: EEEKNTT I5 KENTE +28 66
#note Static evaluator likes KEET, because ENT is a better leave than ET. I played KENTE because it doesn't give up a front S-hook. On the sim, KENTE is slightly ahead of KEET, which is slightly ahead of KETENE, but they're all neck and neck.

#note SOWING is the play here. I don't like IY, but I guess it beats IO.

#note Hoping to bingo next turn, which turned out well.

#note I would have played it safe with CHIPOTLE, had he not blocked it.
>Doug: ACFOOTV A1 CA.OOT +36 320
>Will: ??DIIPS O8 SaPIDIt. +92 364
#note CAHOOT blocked the only triple-triple, SPHIngID. I think I would have found it; I know it, but by the time he played CAHOOT, the only thing I had seen through the H was SHIPsIDe.
>Doug: EEFNRVX 2J VEXER +64 384
#note Damn.
>Will: AEIJNOU H1 JU.E +36 400
#note I agonized for a while about whether to play JUTE at H1 or 12A, and it seemed to me there were too many counterplays from the J with DEEEFLNNRUY unseen. My play was second best, winning around 32%, but JUTE at 12A wins about 37%. As it happens, with the way the tiles fell, I would have won had I made the right play.
>Doug: DFLNNUY 5I ..NDLY +28 412
#note Doug finds one of the two plays which wins 5/8 of the time, the other being FENNY. (I wish he had played FENNY, because I'd have won.) 
>Will: AEEEINO 6C AE.IE +17 417
#note This is the best endgame sequence, but I spend a while looking for a winning one. Maybe if I had played AERIE immediately, Doug would have used those last 16 seconds and gone overtime. Still, better this than missing a winning sequence.
