#note After challenging off his outplay, we proceeded to hit each others clocks several times each for some reason, but Jesse chose not to enforce the six pass rule.
>jesse_matthews: ?AEEFR M3 FE.j +26 361
#note Jesse put his tiles down, and I told him to designate the blank as a J. I promised I wouldn't challenge, so he obliged. I held the play to mess with him, and eventually let it stand. Challenging and then passing sims 3 points higher, but I didn't want to get tackled on the way to the challenge computer.
