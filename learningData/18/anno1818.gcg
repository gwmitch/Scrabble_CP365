#note Not the ideal play, but wanted to keep the board closed to guard against bingoes, since I was sure opp was closer to a bingo than me(almost goes without saying with QEMN....)

#note Opp's got another lane anyway, so figured I might as well open another lane allowing better play-back after a bing.

#note Didn't know Quinol(O8) which is definitely the best play for 45.  Played union partly to block, partly to setup for quote next turn, hoping to draw a T(4 unseen)
