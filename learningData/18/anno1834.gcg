>Ryan_Fischer: IIIIMNO -IIIMO +0 0
#note IMINO keeping II is best; forgot that one.  I still don't think I understand the logic behind keeping high-point tiles on an exchange.  I've always thought that when you keep one you risk the chance of drawing another, making it harder to bingo.  After 1000 4-ply it's keep IMNO then IMN then play IMINO, THEN my exchange.  I just don't get it.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AFINR 8D INFRA +18 18
>Ryan_Fischer: EILNSVW H7 V.W +9 9
#note It's very close between this and W(I)VE D7 10.  Though mine comes up 2nd most of the time, slipping into 1st every now and then, I think I'll keep the E, thanks.
>Harriette_Lakernick: PU D7 P.U +5 23
#note Oh, it's gonna be one of THOSE games, is it?  So defensive.  Not to worry...
>Ryan_Fischer: EILNSTW E6 WI.TLE +24 33
#note I thought my playing WINTLE even though she blocked is creative.  It sims 6th after 1300 4-ply.  It at least gives the board a bit more breathing room while I draw 5 fresh to NS.  Throwing the W back in is one suspicious option.  WE(F)T F6 and TWI(N) E5 both score 18 and balance, but I'm looking to get things moving a bit more.
>Harriette_Lakernick: CIMSU 12C MUSIC +28 51
>Ryan_Fischer: NNORRSV H12 SORN +26 59
#note Risk you take with drawing 5, though SORN is the best scoring play by far.  It's either this or exchanging, and do I really want to continue to fish on a board that's not conducive to it?
>Harriette_Lakernick: IK 14F KI. +17 68
#note Fine, clog it up more.
>Ryan_Fischer: NRSTUVZ -NRUVZ +0 59
#note It's (L)UVS for 19 or exchanging.  I think I threw all back but ST.  Quackle hates it.  It likes TUN 13B after 400 4-ply, but what do I do with RSVZ if it misses?  There are 5 plays it likes before an exchange, keeping RST.
>Harriette_Lakernick: IIMR 15C MIRI +13 81
>Ryan_Fischer: ENSTTUY 13B SYN +28 87
#note I don't know what possessed me to play SYN.  Maybe just that I can now say I have.  Best scoring play, but the leave leaves something to be desired.  Best is YET 13B 22.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AO 7G O.A +11 92
>Ryan_Fischer: EHRSTTU 10H SHUTTER +74 161
#note I luck into another S and a bingo.  I played the 2nd half of this game better than the first, though I think at this point SYN mighta been my only questionable move.
>Harriette_Lakernick: AELX 6I AXLE +29 121
>Ryan_Fischer: EGLORUV F2 VULGO +26 187
#note It's nice when racks play themselves.
>Harriette_Lakernick: DFOO M3 FOOD +29 150
#note AERY, EYRA, YEAR, YARE... but which one?
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEERRY N2 AERY +26 213
#note HAH, I got it right!  Whoo!
>Harriette_Lakernick: BELT O1 BLET +33 183
#note She tells me I blocked NOBLEST, which I played in a later game.  Cool.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEHINR 4B CHAR.IE +26 239
#note I was so fixated on ARCHINE (not CHAINER*/RECHAIN*) not playing that I also got fixated on a cool word I just learned, and played it instead.  It breaks up a lot of promise, but killing the top of the board somewhat is nice.  AH(OY) is the play I shoulda been looking for.  (C)H(I) for 21 is also awesome.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EJNO L8 JE.ON +40 223
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADDEGN 8L .ADE +36 275
#note I didn't look too long for a bingo, wanting to neutralize the J.  They're all common, though.  uNG(R)ADED is the only flat out winner, 'cause of the defensive quality, I guess.  As and Es to play JANE through, sure, but it doesn't open the lower TLS.  I'm fine countering her J play with my own though, keeping the blank and waiting to see if something develops with the C in the other quadrant.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ANQT D1 QAN.T +24 247
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEGNP H1 PAG.D +27 302
#note Missing Po(U)NDAGE J8 65, this is second best.
>Harriette_Lakernick: B 5L B.. +12 259
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DENOOZ B4 .OZ +34 336
#note She's fishing, time to shut 'er down.  This is where I get myself into trouble, leaving the board open way too long, hoping to bingo myself.  sNOOZED is a no-go.  I thought I had to play COZ now and empty the bag.  It's actually a pretty horrible play despite the unlikeliness of a bingo.  I should just dump the O and play it out from there.  Subanagram match: From the N it's (N)EGATIvE.  From the C it's (C)hIGETAI.  Both incredibly hard to see, and she was shuffling furiously.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?AEGIIT O10 sTAGIE +31 290
#note She could have extended (KIR)IGAmI, but she did that instead.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?AEGIIT --  -31 259
#note I dodge a bullet, she had no bingo there.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEEENO B4 ...ENED +23 359
#note Best.
>Harriette_Lakernick: ?AEGIIT 13J GAsT +20 279
#note She doesn't counter (COZ)ENED either, with something like ImAGE.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EO A8 OnE +16 375
#note Best, and I finally feel like I'm playing okay, though it's obvious I still have a long way to go.
