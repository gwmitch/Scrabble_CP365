#note neither of us was completely sure that this was a word.
>ben: AEEISTT I8 .EATIEST +62 62
#note but it gave him a bingo (actually a choice of two bingos), so he left it on
>kate: AADILOP H13 POI +27 51
#note why not PIA? i have no idea.
>ben: COTU G4 TOUC. +13 75
#note at which point i can't remember whether TOUCHE is a word.
>kate: AADILSS H1 ALIAS +23 74
#note choosing not to leave the S in the top line by playing SALAD for more points.
>ben: IX J10 XI +52 127
>kate: DEGOSSZ K7 DOZES +46 120
#note taking out the scary spot, sacrificing two points from the other placement (plus, still not sure if WHAP is a word, don't want to risk getting WHAPS challenged off)
>ben: AY L8 YA +29 156
>kate: ?GLNRSW 1F WR.NGLeS +61 181
#note saw all three, maybe should've played WARSLiNG to try to draw a challenge.

#note there's an even better nine that I didn't know
>ben: ACT A12 CA.T +27 198
>kate: ADEEINO 11D ADENI... +18 271
#note i'm not sure if this is exactly the tiles i had, but it was close. I wanted to take out the T and saw this right away, and liked it for style value.  not a great play by any stretch.  I did think about it for quite awhile (for me), though, so that's a partial victory.

>kate: AEEEOOO -EEOOO +0 271
#note meh.  he blocks COOEE, so I guess I trade.

>kate: ABEFFGU M9 GAFFE +43 314
#note lucky draw
>ben: KLLV 13K KV.LL +12 259
>kate: ABEERUY O11 AB.ER +30 344
#note KVELL blocks my stylish BEERY.  I don't see BARLEY and don't know BURLEY, but I'm also hoarding the Y to make (TOUCH)Y later. 
>ben: OV F8 .OV. +18 277
#note fishy, fishy. at this point, in my mind, he must have the blank.
>kate: DEGINUY M1 .UEDING +22 366
#note eight in the bag... i decide to block the easy seven lane, taking knowledge of opponent into account.  My play creates a second Q spot, so no big deal there. I keep holding the Y for scoring opportunities... and ben has a better ability to muck around at the end and create wins, so i want to get to the end more quickly rather than less.

#note this is the first time EVER that i've played a stupid SOWPODS three.  grr.
>ben: ?EEMORT B5 MOThERE. +63 351
#note if it's good and i challenge, i lose.  either way, if i don't challenge, i win.  i guess i won't challenge.
>kate: DHIIORY 9E H.Y +31 397
#note not 100% sure about HYDRO, don't want to lose and be taunted.  go with the sure thing.  Blah.
