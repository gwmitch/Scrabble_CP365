>Randy_Hersom: DEKY 8G DYKE +24 24
>Sam: ADEHORT 9I AH +18 18
#note Saw DYKED, of course, but didn't trust my word knowledge. Not a good start to the tournament. Quackle likes K8 DOTH best, and so do I.
>Randy_Hersom: ASTV K5 VATS +27 51
>Sam: DEELORT 10F DOLE +16 34
>Randy_Hersom: LUV 6H ULV. +15 66
>Sam: CEEGRST 7K .EG +6 40
#note Liked this play a lot, it gives me three legit bingo lanes. Quackle likes LEG equally (.3>TEG); does anyone else like LEG more than TEG? TEG sets up three S hooks for my terrific CERST leave, while LEG sets up one. Also, It's probable he has an S given VATS, so he could take the S hook of LEGS leaving me almost nothing.
>Randy_Hersom: AAMNST N2 MANTAS +25 91
>Sam: CEENRST 11A CENTRES +73 113
#note Only bingo. He blocked the badass TENRECS for 85.
>Randy_Hersom: DEIM O1 DIME +35 126
>Sam: AAEGHRY A11 .HARY +51 164
>Randy_Hersom: CEEFINR D6 INFEC.ER +84 210
>Sam: AAEEGIW 8A WAI. +30 194
>Randy_Hersom: OZ B6 ZO. +32 242
>Sam: AAEEGII M3 GAE +25 219
#note Q and I like this best--a tough leave to stomach, but worth the 25 points in my opnion
>Randy_Hersom: IQS E4 QIS +26 268
#note Annoyingly, Randy and I both added 242 and 26 to equal 278, cheating me out of 10 spread points this tourney. I double-check almost every score, so this sort of thing rarely happens. At least it didn't affect the outcome
>Sam: AEIIITU -IIIU +0 219
#note Quackle likes keeping AET better than keeping E on equity, but likes keeping E in terms of win%. In hindsight, with both blanks out, I like going for turnover and keeping just E slightly better than my play.
>Randy_Hersom: EGIOTUW L2 WOG +31 299
>Sam: AAEILLT 13C A.ILLATE +70 289
#note If I can draw a blank, I'm back in the game.
>Randy_Hersom: ENTX 12J NEXT +24 323
#note He drew BOTH blanks on this play.
>Sam: BDIIJOR 14H DIB +28 317
#note I thought about this play for a long time, and made a poor decision. ORIBI, which I considered, looks clearly best. I can draw an O for JOW, I block more effectively than DIB, I play 5 tiles angling for a blank. ORIBI is also the highest-scoring play.
>Randy_Hersom: ??ENNPU 15C UNPENs +33 356
>Sam: IJOORRU 2J JO. +29 346
#note Ugh, I hate positions like this. Down by 39, he probably kept the blank and even if he didn't, he probably drew it. I just went for the points and hoped to get miraculously bailed out; basically, I was cutting spread. 
>Randy_Hersom: ?BIRTU 4B BRI.UeT +36 392
#note Held on this, but decided not to challenge even though I'd never seen it. It sounded legit, and with my rack, I couldn't win anyway.
>Sam: IIOORRU H1 ROU. +12 358
#note I'm a little confused on how to figure out this endgame with Quackle, but I think ROU(X) looks best.
>Randy_Hersom: FOOP B2 FO. +16 408
>Sam: IIOR 11L OI +13 371
#note Didn't notice OPE/POI--thankfully, neither did he.
>Randy_Hersom: OP 3H .PO +17 425
#note Not really the way I wanted to start off, but I played all right--by my count, I dropped 28.3 equity points in this one.
>Randy_Hersom:  (IR) +4 429
