#note It may seem crazy, but here's my logic: the Q is still out there, and if I don't keep a U, the golden rule is that I'll always draw it, and assuming I draw it, QUE is a nice set of letters to work with

#note Interestingly, L3 D(OWE)D 10 sims highest. It took me a while to figure out that by doing that, I could miracle draw into OBLIQUE by getting an O and an I (or the blank for one of the two) from the bag. He of course would have to not block it.
