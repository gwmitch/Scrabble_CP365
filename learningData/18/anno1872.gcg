>Ryan_Fischer: EHORRRT 8G THRO +14 14
#note RHETOR is the clear winner.  I know the word, hard to find unless you're aware of it in a game context.  A lot of common words are like that.  As soon as I hit the clock, I forgot about the W hook I was leaving (and was totally oblivious to the E and B hooks, too).  Didn't come into play, though.
>Rick_Wong: MO 9G OM +15 15
>Ryan_Fischer: EINORRU 10E OUR +8 22
#note Trying to get the best leave possible, even if it did sacrifice a bit of defense (something I've been told D2 players worry TOO much about, and therefore maybe I shouldn't focus on so much).  EURO, OURIE, and URINE, using the E hook, do best before my play.
>Rick_Wong: INX 11C NIX +38 53
>Ryan_Fischer: EEINRSS 11G SEINERS +68 90
#note This was played on me in my second tourney and I challenged.  I missed the E hook for a 2x2 with its anagram, SEREINS, though.  Has one more, too.
>Rick_Wong: ACLT H11 .CLAT +30 83
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AIINTV L8 VIT.AINs +78 168
#note Being a VISITANT NATIVIST is best for the economy and for this board, but that's a little bit off for me.  Top 12k 8s.  He held me for a bit on VIT(R)AINs, though.
>Rick_Wong: BEI 8L .IBE +27 110
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEEINU 15C INdUC.EE +60 228
#note There was a LOT of juicy stuff that didn't play here, so it took me a long while to settle on my play.  There is a disconnected 9 based on the top 2000k 8s, so it's relatively easy to find if you're familiar with the word ('cause it ends in S).  At 62, it's the best play.  Mine's 2nd.  Also of note is 15F IN(T)UmE(s)CE 59.  Heh.  And yes, I am drawing like a beast, but I'm not missing too badly either, which makes it all the more painful when it falls apart.
>Rick_Wong: ADO 12C ADO +26 136
>Ryan_Fischer: DINQRTY 10I QI +28 256
>Rick_Wong: AGLOOPU O1 APOLOGU. +86 222
#note Nothing to say except "Very nice play."
>Ryan_Fischer: DMNRTYZ 13K D.TZY +36 292
#note Best play, but it would come to hurt me later.
>Rick_Wong: EHP O12 H.PE +48 270
#note Whoda thunk a Y there wouldn't be safe?  I wonder if there's merit to my KEEPING my Y to hook next turn?
>Ryan_Fischer: DFGIMNR 14H .RF +29 321
#note Best again.
>Rick_Wong: AJ 10L .AJ +28 298
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGIMST M7 M.D.. +18 339
#note Conrad warned me this guy knows all the 5s.  I thought this one seemed right, though.  There is at least one other word like this referring to the qualities of a mythological figure, but I guess that's no excuse.  :)
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGIMST --  -18 321
>Rick_Wong: AEU 14B EAU +10 308
#note This is where it all started to go downhill, 'cause outta the corner of my eye, I keep looking for that B, or trying to figure out how to stop a monster play there without giving too much back.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADGIMST 2L GIM. +18 339
#note I shoulda played this in the first place (or GAMP, same spot), or GAM(B) N5, which is best.
>Rick_Wong: DEL L2 .LED +12 320
#note Clever little hook setup.  I can't really block without giving too much up myself.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEFNSST K4 FENS +25 364
#note It's FEND or FEDS in the same spot.  Right idea, though.
>Rick_Wong: EE 6K .EE +10 330
#note Kills his own hook, but whatev.
>Ryan_Fischer: DKLORST 6J K... +18 382
>Rick_Wong: Y 10D Y... +14 344
>Ryan_Fischer: DLORSTW 4K ..W +9 391
#note WOL(FE)D 4H 17, but I really don't feel like opening it.  R(I)OT M1 18 is the best of the non opening moves.  Mine is second.
>Rick_Wong: AO N12 A.O +37 381
#note Helpless to stop this for the longest time.  I don't know what I could've done except NOT play D(I)TZY earlier.  Thoughts?  As a sidenote, he'd've been safer playing (Z)OA, as it prevents hooking (AZO)N as I'll do later.  Of course, he needs the volatility more than I do.
>Ryan_Fischer: DLNORST 13A LO +4 395
#note And now I really feel I have to stop the B hook.  It's been lurking for so long, but who's to say it isn't still in the bag?  And OF COURSE, it's so clear now.  D(ADO) is the move that stops that silly B hook!  Champ picks it with an 89% win percentage (58% in actuality after simming for about 600 spins 4-ply).  :)  Ideally, I play off two tiles here, but it's risky dumping that O now because of how few vowels there are.  Forming DOE for an extra 4 points is an option.  The problem with my move is something like A(L)BA or A(L)BS is still hittable.  The former for him, the latter for me.  And of course, this nightmare...
>Rick_Wong: AEGRV A8 GRAVE. +33 414
#note And OF COURSE, the B is still in the bag.  He must've just been really heavy on vowels then.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABDNRST 10A .B +10 405
#note I have to stop his play of (A)W, and hopefully W-stick him now (he has one spot, but for only 5).  The Championship player is wrong here (a first?)  Its sequence has me losing by 16.  I only end up losing by 12.
>Rick_Wong: ITW 5N W. +5 419
>Ryan_Fischer: ADNRST 15L .AN. +16 421
>Rick_Wong: IT 8A .IT +4 423
>Rick_Wong:  (DRST) +10 433
#note Oh well.  At last AFTER the screwup I played the endgame better than Quackle could for some reason.  If it weren't for MIDAS and LO, the rest of the tourney would be a vastly different story.  If I had to get a Scrabble tattoo, it would be something like "mistakes kill."
