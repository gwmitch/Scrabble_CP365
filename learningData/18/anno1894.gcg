>Kevin_Rickoff: IJRSTU 8D JURIST +42 42
>Ryan_Fischer: DEPRRTW E8 .PDREW +24 24
#note This is the high point.  Totally bogus, and barely sims better than TW(I)RP.
>Kevin_Rickoff: NNOU 13C UN.ON +18 60
>Ryan_Fischer: ?RRTTTU -RTTU +0 24
#note Ew.  And no, Quackle, T(O)RT is totally insane.
>Kevin_Rickoff: ?BEEILN H1 BEELINe. +80 140
>Ryan_Fischer: ?MNOPRT 5C TROMP.Ng +72 96
#note Missed ORP(I)MeNT, which I would learn soon after.
>Kevin_Rickoff: EEY 6E EYE. +36 176
#note ...but I don't deserve THIS.  Mine's better defensively, and the TLS would've been exposed anyway.  -_-
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEIINQ C12 Q.ID +14 110
#note This is pretty sad.  QI 6B 33.  Disgusting.
>Kevin_Rickoff: AWY 15A WA.Y +45 221
#note Held on this for a while because I'm so used to seeing it as WADI.  Luckily a similar situation came to mind and I came to my senses.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEINOT 11D E.ECTION +70 180
#note This, or CENO(B)ITE, which I'd learn soon after, too.
>Kevin_Rickoff: AEGILST 2H .GALITES +72 293
#note Grrr.
>Ryan_Fischer: AHKLOUV 10J HOLK +34 214
#note Should be HAKU 1J, though at this point I'm finding it REALLY hard to give a shit.
>Kevin_Rickoff: BFO 14F FOB +31 324
#note The nerve.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEOUV 15H AVE +30 244
#note I'm so out of it, I'm inverting the hooks for the B, and I'm thinking only an A will do here.  EAVE is so much better.
>Kevin_Rickoff: AEMNV 14J MAVEN +42 366
#note And that's why.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEOORUX 12K OXO +23 267
#note Yeah, I just wanna go home.  There are at least two spots at which this scores better.
>Kevin_Rickoff: AGGLR 3C GARGL. +18 384
#note He takes out a line.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIRUZ 2B RAZE +42 309
#note I play this instead of DAZE to throw more volatility into the game.  I never cash in, though.
>Kevin_Rickoff: ACIRSST O9 SACRIST +91 475
#note This is why.
>Ryan_Fischer: DDFIOUU -  +0 309
#note I challenge, 'cause what the hell?  I'm not 12k deep into the 7s and won't be for a while.  Sure it's an anagram of a 6-plus-S, but WHAT TEH EFF?!
>Kevin_Rickoff: AHI 1K AHI +23 498
#note He misses here for once.
>Ryan_Fischer: DDFIOUU N6 FIDO +18 327
#note Best.
>Kevin_Rickoff: AEIT M5 AIT +12 510
>Ryan_Fischer: DUU 13M DU. +18 345
#note Best.
>Kevin_Rickoff: E O1 E. +6 516
#note And the nightmare is over.
>Kevin_Rickoff:  (U) +2 518
#note So I played like shit and drew like shit.  I'm just thankful he didn't try to ameliorate it.  The perfectly shitty ending to a perfectly shitty first half.  Calgon, take me away!
