>Jesse_Day: AMNQTTU 11F QU.NTA +30 66
#note it looks like a small thing, but QUAINT is definitely better for not giving back all the hooks offered by QUINTA. It's not like lester isn't going to know them all.
>Lester_Schonbrun: ABW 12K WAB +21 101
>Jesse_Day: EFLMNTV 13L LEFT +24 90
#note I have no idea how I didn't have the hooks to QUINTA in mind - possibly still steaming from the last loss? I sure hope not. In any case, this is a terrible play, and FLAM rocks the house.
>Lester_Schonbrun: FGI O10 GIF. +12 113
>Jesse_Day: AELMNUV 14K VELA +32 122
#note this play may sim best, but I felt the rest of the game feeling that I'd missed a really big opportunity, because I'm one tile off from UNGIFTED for the 117 point triple-triple. Believe it or not, I played my play in part because I was worried that he might be going for the same play! Given his actual rack, it turns out that he was just trying to improve his leave, but VELA was a bit of a blocking play too. I really don't have any good plays that keep the tiles I need anyway - the best I can come up with is LAV at 10K, which I think just sacrifices too much, even with three shots at the D. What do you all think?

>Jesse_Day: EIJMNNO 2A JOIN +28 186
#note quackle likes JOINT better because it gives up fewer big plays - to the triple or overlaps. I guess I just wanted to stay out of the way of the open lanes on the board.
>Lester_Schonbrun: EX 3B EX +44 241
#note of course, this is one of the consequences of playing JOIN versus JOINT.
>Jesse_Day: EEMNRTW 13C REW.N. +22 208
#note down just under a bingo, why not open another a lane for him to worry about instead of allowing him to block? Quackle MEW at 2H or 5D...I like REWIND because it's harder to deal with the new lane.
>Lester_Schonbrun: OOU I6 OU.O +17 258
>Jesse_Day: EEMNOST 10J EM +18 226
#note Ouch. time to go review my high-prob 7s. Especially painful because I would've had a good shot at winning the game given what transpired.
>Lester_Schonbrun: OO 6D OO. +3 261
#note uhoh.
>Jesse_Day: AEENOST 15L ETNA +32 258
#note $#)&#)$*&!@#)$*@! It's not an easy find, but goddamnit, I deserved to lose with misses like that.
>Lester_Schonbrun: AA N9 AA +9 270
#note if I had hit TONEMES earlier, I would very likely be up by fifty by now.
>Jesse_Day: DENOSVY J2 ENVOY +34 292
#note At the time I thought this was the game losing play; that was before realizing I'd missed two easy, easy bingos. Sure, ENVOY scores a bunch, but who cares? He's going to bingo, and my worry should be bingoing back as soon as possible. I thought afterwards that my try to win the game should've been IVY at 4F. Quackle also suggests ENVOYS at M5, which blocks the two easiest lanes, akthough he almost surely has something else. In a regular old sim, ENVOY is second  (to ENVOYS at the same spot...I guess burning the S makes a lot of sense). Assuming that he has his actual rack, however, IVY is basically dead even. So maybe ENVOY wasn't so bad, but it sure felt as though I was giving up.
>Lester_Schonbrun: ?AEIPRS L4 tRAIPSE +77 347
>Jesse_Day: DDGLORS 6L .G +3 295
#note Fishing for one tile in the bag and one alone - the C for CODDLERS, hoping that he blocks the wrong one. It's 82 if I hit it, so with luck if he blocks it I'll have enough to squeak out a win. Quackle, of course, hates it and prefers plays that empty the bag...how is GOLDS going to win anything? So far as I see it, CODDLERS wins 1/11 times, and I don't see anything else that's anywhere close. Suggestions, anyone?
>Lester_Schonbrun: ABHIIOY 5D BY. +30 377
#note a smart play. I guess this is the sort of occasion where CODDLERS loses anyway.
>Jesse_Day: D 15H .D +3 298
#note ooh, I love it - fishing for an unblockable outbingo that doesn't exist! I thought that I had DORSALS and ROADLESS if I drew the A, but DORSALS doesn't fit! Not that it matters anyway - the game is over, I just hemmorhaged some more spread for the sake of it.

>Lester_Schonbrun: AI C13 .IA +6 407
#note I evidently screwed something up, because I had him going out for 10. Did he sneak one by me??
>Lester_Schonbrun:  (R) +2 409
#note So happy I got to play Lester! I'm not even sure why. I just liked playing one of the old-timers of scrabble (I hope he doesn't mind me calling him that). So far as the game itself, I did enough stupid things that I clearly deserved to lose. I may have to look into working on those high-prob 7s....no, seriously. I just plugged the top 500 7s into my cardbox, and 501-1000 are next.
