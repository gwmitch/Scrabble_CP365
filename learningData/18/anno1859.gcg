>Rob: FINOSUU -FUU +0 0
#note The duck has a hard time picking a favorite between 8D FUSION and 8G FOU.  Exchanging FUU sims a bit more than a point behind.
>Peter: II -II +0 0
>Rob: EIIINOS -OII +0 0
#note I suppose this is why.
>Peter: Q -Q +0 0
>Rob: EILNOSV -V +0 0
#note It's basically a toss-up between VOILE and -V for Quackle, but given our Mexican Standoff, there's no doubt in my mind that exchanging is best here.  I should be in good shape should he hit his bingo first.

#note PTY(A)LIN is a bad miss here, but at least I got the booby prize.

#note Playing off more consonants is better here.  D(A)NGLY 5G is best.

#note Quackle prefers opening things up a bit here, favoring M7 WO and 8J WA(D)IES.  AW(E)E  is a few points back in the sim, but I still think I like it best.  It sheds another vowel against a relatively vowel-laden bag, and leaves the board somewhat restricted for Peter to bingo on.  The vast majority of the time, he will be creating lines even as he bingos, which is not necessarily the case with either of Quackle's choices.  Yes, an easier bingo line is not a bad thing when holding a blank, but Peter can put a serious crimp in my plans if he beats me to the bingo.

#note I'm overvaluing the S on this board...it's a great tile for bingoing, but it's not likely to help me get the bingo on the board.  14A VIS is the play here.
>Peter: ?ACEGIN B2 CoINAGE +77 375
#note Well, this isn't good...
>Rob: ?DIJSSV 4A V.DS +24 307
#note Do I blow the blank now and hope for S-hook heroics later on, or do I hold the blank and the J and hope for other heroics?  A tough call, but the sim (barely) bears me out here.
>Peter: EGR 4J REG +16 391
>Rob: ?AAEIJS 6L .AJ +26 333
#note (R)AJ and (R)AJA are essentially tied in the sim.  Dropping another vowel is a nice idea, but I think Quackle is seriously underestimating the power of the A hook.  If Peter has the last A, c'est la vie.  If he doesn't, then he certainly has to alter his play to try to block.  I'll take any chance I get to dictate play while down 70 and a blank in hand.
>Peter: ORT 7K T.RO +17 408
>Rob: ?AEEHIS J11 ...H +30 363
#note I saw and rejected the bingos, rightly figuring that I would be quite unlikely to be able to eke out a win after Peter cashes in on the H1 hotspot.  However, the question is what non-bingo play is best here?  Quackle prefers M9 (Z)EE, and in retrospect I agree -- it achieves vowel/consonant balance, allows me to handle drawing another E with no problem at all, and holds the H in reserve.
>Peter: GO 8N GO +20 428
>Rob: ?AAEEIS M9 .EE +20 383
#note The duck favors dropping the S for equity-saving spread purposes, but going for the Hail Mary wins about 39% of the time.
>Peter: NTU 6B .UNT +4 432
#note Peter is correct to leave the O at O8, given that I've just played off two vowels, but he was overtime at this point and had to quickly decide whether to block the S or the C.  I can't say for sure without knowing what his rack was, but it's all but impossible to block both without creating a lane for sevens.
>Rob: ?AAEISU 2A A.EqUIAS +61 444
#note Just call me Doug Flutie.  Peter went two minutes overtime, final score 470-412.
