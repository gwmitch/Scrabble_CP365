#note Happy to find a tricky best play here, but it took me a little longer than I liked to make sure I didn't have a bingo. I also wondered about potential extensions to FLOCCI, but turns out that they're all to FLOC - stuff like FLOCCULATE or FLOCCULANT.

#note this move didn't make sense to me, though it might in part be because he didn't know CAMERA took the E.

#note I played my bingo pretty quickly, and it took him about a minute to hold it before challenging it off. I'm not usually the type to intentionally phony, and I hardly have an olaughesque reputation that allows me to do so, but, well, I thought I would get away with it. When I got back I saw that I had ANEARED, and quackle reveals that I have DRAINER, which I think I would've seen; then again, I also saw IRADE, so I knew the points were available. I suppose that in retrospect I'm not unhappy with making the play I did, but it set the tone for the rest of the game, and certainly cost me a whole lot of equity. Some mathy stuff suggests that I needed about a 72% chance of him accepting for it to be worth trying the phony...I might've given two-thirds, but then again I missed the big plays at the time.

#note as expected, his next play blocks most of the spots, although it leaves the E on CAMERA. it's hardly time to get worried, but I still hd a hard time finding a play that adequately balanced scoring enough and keeping a bingo leave. quackle likes almost none of the two tile plays of AR, except for REAR at 12J, which prevents him from using that spot to score next turn and gives me an R as a bonus. But the winner is DARN at L12 downward, which I suppose I should've thought harder about - I thought it offered too much back compared to my play of DARER, which still takes out that spot, but I think the lanes it leaves me are a lot better, including a new E hook, and maybe even a bingo to the triple unless he plays there. AENR isn't really any better than AER anyway.

#note wow, talk about overkill. However, I actually found what is by far the best bingo - I really thought there might be something that hooked DE as well, but I guess I'm glad that I actually found a good play. He just about challenged as well - as I mentioned, he didn't know CAMERAE.
>Webster_Phillips: OTV O12 VO.T +33 148
#note I waited for KILOVOLT and MEGAVOLT and the like for a while afterwards, but I don't think I ever came that close.
>Jesse_Day: BDEINOT 15E DOBIE +26 141
#note lots of choices come up, but quackle seems to agree with me. the fishes don't pay off.
>Webster_Phillips: LOQU G4 QUOL. +15 163
#note why not down one?
>Jesse_Day: AEJNNTU 5E JA.NT +24 165
#note a pretty solidly mediocre play, dissolving the nucleus of a good rack. I guess QUOLL made me fear a big play to the triple, but JAUNT doesn't really help, either. quackle seems to like JUTS at F10 or JUNTO at E9 - I don't get JUTS at all. I sort of liked JAUNT because it allows me Q plays with a good draw, but JUNTO has to be better. Why is JUT so competitive?
>Webster_Phillips: DE 5E .....ED +30 193
>Jesse_Day: ENTUWXY 4G .UEY +27 192
#note problems with time pressure starting now. I really wanted to hit OXO, yet my play did almost nothing to facilitate an X play, and instead allows big plays. Quackle likes my play ok, but much better is YOU at 6F, obviously. why not score two more points and keep a vowel?
>Webster_Phillips: DEFOS 3I FEODS +42 235
>Jesse_Day: HIMNTWX E11 WH. +18 210
#note this felt like a terrible play, but it ends up only being bad. There's absolutely no reason not to play FIXT, which leaves me down 13, rather than playing for an O that I don't need. But the best play is somehow dropping the W at 6F, which allows me to play the X for more next turn with a good draw, and at least gives me a half decent X play and an ok leave therafter.
>Webster_Phillips: B 6F B. +20 255
#note the board is shutting down in a hurry, another reason why dropping the W would've been appealing.
>Jesse_Day: EILMNTX K7 M.X +21 231
#note I wake up with a good rack, but my winning chances are still no more than 30% or so. FIX isn't quite as good.
>Webster_Phillips: AIPS 9D PIAS +28 283
>Jesse_Day: EILNPTU 8A LITU +20 251
#note strongly debated playing SPINULET. I think he would challenge. My winning chances have dropped a bunch, but I like my play for keeping a couple of active spots on the board. Quackle thinks URP at D12 is better, but I'm pretty sure that's just from misplays.
>Webster_Phillips: GIIV A4 VIGI. +13 296
#note blocking my bingo
>Jesse_Day: AEGINPT L1 GA. +7 258
#note so close to something that fits on the right. Quackle dislikes my play greatly, but once again that has to be because it doesn't block in the sim. GAD at least makes him have just the right tiles to be able to block all my lanes. quackle's darling is APT or APO, both of which are great until  he blocks the S. APO makes even less sense because it blocks DARERS in case I draw the S. I thought about playing VIGILANTE out of spite. Why is there no Y for EGYPTIAN? I could just be thinking about the entire positiong wrong - maybe I should just play APT, keep a good leave, force him to block and then hope to make up the spread with fortuitous drawing/hitting a miracle draw to the T, but GAD seems better.

#note another blocked bingo, though this one was clearly going to happen. At this point I have to hit a bingo to win. I didn't think of fishing for PENITENT or APERIENT on the left, though those occur to me now. My play sucks because it actually blocks a perfectly good lane that I should be trying to hit. quackle seems to like plays that empty the bag more, such as REPIN up top, PEIN in the same spot or TIEPIN on the B column, but all three seem inaccurate given what webster's next play would be - even though he'd have to empty the bag, I'd have nowhere to bingo, except maybe hitting the very top with TIEPIN followed by a ridiculous draw. PE is clearly wrong, but what else makes any sense? I sort of like quackle's suggestion of VEEP at 4A, which scores enough to make a bingo on my part probably a winning play, and keeps tiles that work on row 2, while also giving me one more shot at the blank. PEH also seems reasonable for allowing be a shot at RENITENT/STERNITE, but I think that's actually unlikely to win me many endgames due to tempo issues. But the best one tile fish is probably dropping the E at 12D, which gives three shots at drawing PROTEIN from the bag when I think he's more likely to take out the M column, especially if he doesn't have the S. Really I think it comes down to dropping the E or EN or ER at 6I, but I don't know how to choose between them. I would probably pick dropping the E just so I have a specific plan to win, especially low on time.
>Webster_Phillips: ?AEEITW M3 .WEATIEr +62 388
#note so much for the fishing. actually not that unlikely that he bingos given how good the pool is.
>Jesse_Day: EIKNORT 2F KOI +21 290
#note under time pressure, I miss the best play. The right play is pretty cute, and maybe a little bit counterintuitive.
>Webster_Phillips: NORU D11 OU. +21 409
>Jesse_Day: ENRT B8 .NERT +7 297
#note I always think INTER is phony because it's the name of an italian soccer team. Sometimes I think scrabble would be easier if I had less memories of real things clogging my head.
>Jesse_Day:  (NR) +4 301
#note I played better than I thought I did at the time, but at the same time this game was fairly discouraging - I have one or two of these games every tournament, where it feels as though I have all the chances in the world to pull out the win and some kind of gaffe followed by little mistakes lets the game trickle away beyond my grasp. A lot of my problems in this game were due to time pressure as well, which I had mostly avoided on the first day (at least by my usual standards) and would become more and more of a factor over the next few days as I got more tired. Another way of looking at it is that I gambled the game on him accepting my phony bingo when I didn't need to.
