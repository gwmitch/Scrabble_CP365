#note Quackle says that playing 3I (Z)AG 13 instead of my play is better. I don't get that...

#note My play is the highest scoring, but waaaay low on the list of choices. K9 A(R)ECA 14 and L9 A(R)CADE 18 are among the highest simming

#note My play is 2nd. Quackle suggests that BOX in the same spot is best; I couldn't disagree more. I like mine better...

#note For whatever reason, I told myself that playing where I did was better than scoring a few more points by playing on the bottom. I figured this would allow me a better shot at winning. Another example of 'overthinking'. Shoulda just played on the bottom...

#note As it turns out, playing on the bottom would have prevented him from being able to play this bingo, which would have prevented me from challenging his play unsuccessfully.
