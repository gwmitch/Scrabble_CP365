#note saving the D for the hook might not have been best, but I thought it would be sort of a toss up.

#note about as bad of a draw as your going to see.  At least I had a vowel.  I put down FUCK(S) first, but thought better of it because of the [BMW] leave.  This way I have a shot at one of two Rs for WR(E)CK too.

#note WORTHY scored a little more, but I liked keeping YOK for YOK(S) at 14J for 35 or on the triple column for 30.  Maybe I should have turned over one more for a chance at an A for the STHENIA hook.
