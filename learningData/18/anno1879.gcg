#note Kibitzer prefers DOE or OE slightly, but I like my move to keep the board as open as possible, despite the slightly inferior leave.  I also leave open the possibility of drawing a C.
>Looby: BCOTT F5 OBT.CT +18 66
#note I guess he didn't have an N.

#note The only other thing I would seriously consider in this position is WIG in the same spot, but the board didn't seem friendly enough for the J.

#note OBTEST is a verb, but OBTECT and OBTECTED are both adjectives.

#note Ugh.  I was faced with a hard decision here, but my move is awful.  Before his play, I was planning to play -UWW, but now that I saw he had bingo letters, it affected my thinking.  I saw he had bingos off the G and wanted to block them.  Things like TALLAGES/TILLAGES/TOLLAGES jumped out to me, but I didn't see the G starting bingos, nor STELLATE off the T.  What's worse is that I gave him a better bingo spot.  By the cold light of day, taking the points with WEIR C10 seems reasonable, though I dismissed it quickly during the game.  But in hindsight, my preferred play is -UWW anyway.  Since he is going to bingo, I want to give myself the optimum chance to bingo back.

#note The main alternative I considered was POW C3, but the six extra points and keeping open row 3 seemed better than keeeping the E.  Kibitzer prefers a move I did not see, TWO 10F.  I guess SUPER is a pretty good bingo leave, but even more importantly it creates an S hook when there are none on this board.  WEPT H1 just makes it too easy for him to close down the board.

#note Frustratingly, I have no better bingo here.  Took me a while to convince myself of that though.

#note My move is probably best, but IMP E3 is a cute play I did not see.

#note I should have burned an extra consonant and scored three more with NERVY.

#note I didn't think I had a choice but to do this.  I thought I needed every point I could get, as he was likely to hit me with the Z on the next turn.  Of course, this is likely to allow Z plays on column A, but I gotta hope and pray that I get lucky.  Championship player sees it differently, preferring IRONY L11, which it thinks wins 61% of the time for me.  I suppose the idea is that I have FORM or FIRM on the next turn to shed consonantage.  If he plays the exact same way as the game, IRONY still loses by 4.  The way the tiles actually fell, I think my position is hopeless.
>Looby: CEGINOO B2 INCOG +37 404
#note Well played by Looby.  Despite drawing the Z myself, I'm lost here, because I can't shed enough points off my rack.
>Dave: MORYZ L11 ZO.. +26 428
#note I had managed my time fairly well for a change against Looby, and now I took almost all of the remaining time to look for something better, but it was not to be found.  That's the problem with saving time for the endgame sometimes. The improvements to be made were on WIRE and ENVY and maybe FIORD.
