#note this was awesome since we've been using this on CGP/LJ as a verb for comic result! 'Don't Hodge me, man!'  Anyhow, she didn't know that, just said 'I guess it's hodgepodge only.'  Despite the unsuccessful attempt, I respected her challenge policies- play-by-play judgment.

>Gigi: EP -  +0 96
#note This surprised me a bit- it's a common word but maybe she thought I misspelled it?
>Jeffrey: CCLMNRY 15B MY +18 241
#note D11 CYM(O)L best, -22.9.  I'm shocked setting up (MY)C isn't rated higher- I also didn't want to give the TWS up/ let her have it.
>Gigi: EP 9K .PE +6 102
#note 'Very punny play!' I told her, concerning the board.
>Jeffrey: CCGLNOR D12 CR.C +35 276

#note Perhaps my worries about her having good tiles were unfounded!
>Jeffrey: ALNOSTV M3 VOLANT.S +74 350
>Jeffrey: ALNOSTV --  -74 276
#note known phoney but I thought if she knew VOLANTE she might not know it's not -S.  She did challenge, although she didn't know VOLANTE.
>Gigi: HNO 8M HON +23 137
>Jeffrey: ALNOSTV N5 VOL.ST +19 295
#note Once I realized what I had I knew I had to play it, challenge or no.  Silly duck doesn't want me shutting up the board quite yet = -12.6.  I make the best play for this turn next turn.

>Gigi: DEO 5L DO.E +8 145
>Jeffrey: AEIKNOY 4H KOINE +34 360
#note i don't agree withe the duck here- it wants OKAY 4J but that keeps the bingo lane open?  Pshaw! I guess putting the K before the TWS can be dengerous, but after her fishing play?  -4.2
