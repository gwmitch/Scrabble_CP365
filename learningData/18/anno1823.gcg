#note i considered CRAGGED but could not convince myself it was good. it's probably not that likely to draw a challenge but i felt like i couldn't afford to lose a turn now. QI 15A also sims better than my positioning of MICKEY. [-8]

>Cesar: ELNNOOR 8K LO.EN +21 352
#note this was a very tough choice. i really wanted to take the A1 spot but then i'd get outscored so i tried to just go for leave. since i have the only two Os there's a chance that if he has the J he won't be able to use it, and i could always draw for it? my move does sim highest which may imply that i was on the right track...
>Peter: BIN A1 NIB +22 370
>Cesar: CIINNOR 13K IONIC +23 375
#note IONIC sims clearly at the top.. i'm not exactly sure why, but my reasoning is that it gave me a shot to go out next turn if he's stuck with all the heavy stuff, and if not, then i draw some heavy stuff and can hopefully outscore him. IONIC also scores a lot.
