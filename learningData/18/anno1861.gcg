#note Nice start, a bit harder find if you haven't studied it (like me), so I was happy to see it.  It's all downhill from here, though.
>Dennis_Taylor: EEILT 7C ELITE +10 10
#note Such a weird play.  What could he have left?
>Ryan_Fischer: AFILPSU E4 PFU. +18 90
#note I KNEW I was missing something, but just couldn't put it together.  PAI(L)FULS/PAI(L)SFUL!  PAI(N)FUL also played as a 2x2 for 48.  PILAF shoulda been obvious, too.  I went for balance, and I guess the answer to the question about what I coulda done is solved.  Sigh.
>Dennis_Taylor: AEJ J5 AJE. +27 37
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEILST 7I A. +7 97
#note Missing STA(P)ELIA.  Just hadn't gotten that far yet.  My own fault.
>Dennis_Taylor: ??EIOTY M8 .ErOTInY +70 107
#note At least he didn't find the best play.  bIOTYpE or IsOTYpE B2 87.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHILST 9A HALITES +66 163
#note Shouldn't've missed LATHIES(T) or HELIAST.  Oh well.

#note Figured he had the S here.  He later told me he didn't.  Gutsy then.  I kept my eye out for (N)ERT(Z).
>Ryan_Fischer: AAAEHIO K2 OHIA +18 235
#note Why couldn't I see AAH C2?  That's just sad.  I also thought about taking AH 10E or something, just to be safe.
>Dennis_Taylor: INX 10D NIX +55 263
#note And yeah, I should have.
>Ryan_Fischer: AACDEEG C1 GAED +28 263
#note Best, for a change.
>Dennis_Taylor: DENRSTU 2H UNS.RTED +72 335
#note He missed UNDREST, which woulda REALLY killed me.

#note Taking (N)ERT(Z) is pretty much outta the question now since I have the last E.  My computer decided to speed up for this sim a bit, so I was able to run 3000 4-ply on the Champ's choices.  xNOVV is best, I'm guessing, because there is an N and several Os in the pool.  G4 NOV(ELS) is interesting in that it scores.  It ends up being second best, but I have to draw pretty perfectly to get an S and a bingo with a V.  (IN)VENT is an option because it opens a lane, but at the expense of the last E.  It will be usable, though, so that's possibly part of the benefit.  My play, throwing in the two Vs, is third.
>Dennis_Taylor: AG 10M .AG +5 369
#note He blocks, but now I have to play through the G to bingo, which, yeah, is a little harder with no E or S (and no A for that matter).
>Ryan_Fischer: DENORRT D9 ..RO +8 307
#note Maybe I should've taken NERTZ, as it simmed second best after 5000 4-ply spins, and was a Champ's choice.  There ARE still a whole lot of draws that can win, though my win pct is 5% now (6% for (IN)TRON).  (YA)RD and D(EH)ORN are also options, the latter being a good, significant extension of EH.  (IN)RO barely shows up, probably because it doesn't score too much.
>Dennis_Taylor: OW O8 WO. +21 390
>Ryan_Fischer: DENORRT 6B OR +8 315
#note Ugly deja vu.
>Dennis_Taylor: OW 1A WO. +21 411
#note ...for him, too.  This is what Scrabble must be like in hell.  :P
>Ryan_Fischer: BDEINRT L1 B.ED +31 346
#note Feh, just take the damn points.  Though NERTZ and BRIN are plausible options, and NERTZ, oddly, has a 16.5% win percentage after 1500 4-ply spins(!).  Earlier I did a subanagram match on the pool, and there are a number of 7s and 8s possible.  Doubtful that I'd see many of them, but I guess the hope that the S is out there or the 8 plays is what drives this.
>Dennis_Taylor: NOV G4 NOV... +9 420
>Ryan_Fischer: CINRRTT 12C T.RN +4 350
#note A pretty bad draw, but not the worst possible, and it's my own fault.  Now to find an out in two.  (FE)RRIC is interesting, but won't do me any good.  (EX)TINCT is an option I didn't see.  The champion's sequence is (HE)IR, (BUNK)O, (O)N, (ZITI)S, C(rAG), L(O), (YA)R, (pass), (MU)T, (pass), T(OR) and out for a 422-449 loss.
>Dennis_Taylor: LOQSV O12 SO +18 438
#note I don't know why I thought T(O)RN was necessary.  Figured I'd best play it first in case I was stopped from losing all those consonants.  Again, it slipped my mind his consonants were worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: CIRT A3 CRIT +10 360
>Ryan_Fischer:  (LQV) +30 390
#note I end up losing by 48, a 21-point swing, forgetting an out-in-two really isn't necessary when the opponent has such a crummy rack.  Well, I missed STA(P)ELIA and PAI(L)FULS, so I can't complain.  This is getting more and more depressing, but I know what I have to work on at least.
