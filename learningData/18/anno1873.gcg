>Sam: I -I +0 0
>Dave: AEELRTU 8G LEU +6 6
#note I debated whether it was better to play here or exchange again.  Sam's not a big word studier, so I thought I might be able to tempt him into hooking an S on LEU.  I also figured that my play would make his likely bingo response lower scoring.
>Sam: EINRRST H2 INSERT.R +59 59
>Dave: ?AAEMRT 5E AMR.ETAs +86 92
#note I didn't spend much time worrying about which bingo to play.  This one does give him an S to play off of, but it also doesn't take any hooks and doesn't slot any vowels.

>Dave: AAADISX N5 AX +52 501
#note I initially saw AX 14I, but given the very strong remaining tile pool for bingos, I didn't want to give him easy hooks into the triple lane.  So I was ready to play XI 14J, keeping the worse leave for defensive reasons.  Then I noticed the safer way to play AX.
>Sam: ?DEORSV 15H OVERDoS. +89 365
#note He had a better bingo, but I still would have bingoed out.
