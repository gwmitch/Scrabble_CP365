>Alex_Fish: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>me: AEEGIOW 9F OI +15 15
#note Okay, so maybe exchanging keeping E is a better idea, but I just hate giving opp two turns to start sometimes. Sometimes being less paranoid is a good strategy...
>Alex_Fish: AEMT 10C TEAM +22 44
>me: AEGNOUW C8 OU.GNAW +24 39
#note What a miracle...
>Alex_Fish: ESTV 15A VEST +36 80
#note He did have a blank at this point, I think...
>me: ?AENRSX D7 AX +34 73
#note I didn't even think of AXON. I think I made this play in ~15 seconds. AX is only a couple points worse...but clearly 2nd best.
>Alex_Fish: ?AGMNTT B2 MATTiNG +79 159
#note oops...
>me: ?EENPRS 6D REPiNES +76 149
#note probably the best, or REPENtS, same spot.
>Alex_Fish: EIV C1 VIE +20 179
#note okay...
>me: IILOOSY 12A YO.I +22 171
>Alex_Fish: DGILNRS E5 L.D +11 190
#note I blocked D(A)RLINGS, he told me. He noticed (VEST)IGES posibility, but not (VEST)INGS...
>me: BCILORS H1 CORBI. +39 210
#note I was actually considering CORBIELS* here, but knowing Alex hasn't studied that far, I figured he wouldn't know CORBEILS (he confirmed this later). Just learning now CORBIN is phoney. I thought (like CORBINA) it was a fish...and I wouldn't have held it if he played it against me
>Alex_Fish: AGINRS 14B A.ING +32 222
#note I thought he didn't have a bingo here, but that seems pretty unlikely...
>me: BEJLSUW J2 JUBE. +30 240
#note turn the J into an I and he blocked (VEST)IBULE...
>Alex_Fish: EILOR 15F OILER +18 240
#note what was that last tile?!
>me: AEHLOSW A1 HAW +38 278
#note hey there A!
>Alex_Fish: AFY 14I FAY +20 260
>me: AEELOST L8 OLEATES +76 354
>Alex_Fish: CEOTU 11H COTE.U +16 276
>me: DFIILPR M5 FLIP +14 368
#note My play is 4th, and silly enough, given my play, I spaced on the best play. I think FLIP trumps the 2nd and 3rd best plays (FLORID J8 and TRIP 4B). Also, I'm fairly certain he thinks COTEAU takes an S, so I want to leave it open, if possible. -14 as far as equity goes, but, I wasn't going to see RIFLIP, so I find it hard to be mad...
>Alex_Fish: ANZ A9 ZAN. +16 292
>me: DDEINOR L1 DIODE +23 391
#note Paranoia maybe? I guess I shouldn't be too concerned about going for points, but I figured he would make a COTEAUS* play, and I could go out. Moral of the story? look at the pool...
>Alex_Fish: DEHKRSU N9 HUSKED +41 333
>Alex_Fish: DEHKRSU --  -41 292
#note Okay, I got that much right...
>me: NRR 2A ...R +6 397
#note Way to go, now try going out...
>Alex_Fish: DEHKRSU 8K H..ED +33 325
#note we both missed the best play!
>me: NR 13L .RN +6 403
#note A total equity loss of 20 disregarding RIFLIP, most all of it coming on DIODE...So I'm happy with this game...learn your sixes kid!
