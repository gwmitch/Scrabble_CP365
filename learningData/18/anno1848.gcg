>Jeff_Martin: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 0
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEFINV 8E FAVE +20 20
#note FAVE has less hooks than FIVE, don't slot the 2x2.  Quackle seems to support my reasoning.
>Jeff_Martin: BEG 9D BEG +14 14
>Ryan_Fischer: EGINNOO D9 .OOING +18 38
#note Missing IONOGEN 10C.  Top 4k 7s, not quite there yet.  ONO 10D is the next top play, but I don't like the hooks it leaves at the DWS.
>Jeff_Martin: AKO C12 KOA +27 41
#note Sorta clogs up the board, but also creates an S hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEGNNT 15A CAN +23 61
#note #8046 - TANGENC(E).  Got a long way to go.  I could only dream of guessing at that.  "The state of being in immediate physical contact."  Who knew?  So I might as well balance, and take the N hook, which is just fine.

>Jeff_Martin: RT 10C T.R +9 50
>Ryan_Fischer: EGLNNTW B13 TW. +29 90
#note Best, and this is where I start putting time pressure on him.  Nice change of pace.
>Jeff_Martin: DE F8 ..ED +14 64
#note Go fish.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGLNNO E13 GEN +17 107
#note It's easier to hook NEE than score from the N.  I could be wrong.  (D)ONGLE 11F is also an option, but I'm learning, why open it up?
>Jeff_Martin: LMU 9H LUM +8 72
#note Let him do the opening.  Finally the lightbulb goes off  (Okay, I'd have it with FAVE(S) anyway, but it's the principle.  :))
>Ryan_Fischer: BELNOST K4 NOBLEST +74 181
#note I am amused by the fact that just last game I blocked NOBLEST for my opponent, something I might question the validity of, and then I play it the next game.  :)
>Jeff_Martin: AEINRSV B4 RAVINES +77 149
>Ryan_Fischer: DDHIORT A7 HOD +35 216
>Jeff_Martin: FHTY 8J H.FTY +25 174
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEIJRT M6 JI.TeRED +84 300
#note Serendipity that he opened this.
>Jeff_Martin: IRTZ L12 RITZ +53 227
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AEIIPW A1 WIPE +33 333
>Jeff_Martin: AM L3 MA +12 239
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AILOUU 15J lA.ULI +42 375
#note I had a choice here: greedily fish for another bingo and leave the Z open, or put the game away now.  Actually (B)I(J)OU is a great fish that solves most of my problems, save the Z.  lA(Z)ULI is second best.  LOLZ, I got distracted and let the sim run over 4000 spins 2-ply, and my play turns out to win (although it likes the other L being a blank better -- and I actually understand why now).  :)
>Jeff_Martin: DEY C3 DEY +22 261
#note He wisely passes up the higher score to give him a chance to cut spread with another bingo, however unlikely.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIOOSUX 15E .IXE +33 408
#note OXO M1 is just stupid for a first choice.  (B)I(J)OU pops up again as an option.  My (N)IXE is most sane, I think, though it doesn't sim best and they're all about 99+% wins.
>Jeff_Martin: AA 14G AA +13 274
#note I bet his is the kind of game that gives me migraines.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIOOQSU 3L .O +8 416
#note Kill this mini hotspot and fish for SEQUOIA or another killer Q play.  I'm not gonna play (J)O -- I'll let him open that up.
>Jeff_Martin: O 6M .O +11 285
#note And he does.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIOQRSU O1 SQUIRE +58 474
#note Sorry.  (He must've been steaming that he lost to an idiot that missed the more risque anagram.  Sigh.)
>Jeff_Martin: AILNPRS 2J PLAN +19 304
#note PSI 13G 27 scores best; I have an out in two places.
>Ryan_Fischer: CEOU 3C .OUCE +9 483
#note Study of 5s pays off.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (IRS) +6 489
#note I was lamenting the fact that I didn't break 500 ONCE during this tournament.  This woulda been that game.  If I'd been on the receiving end, I'd want to throw things.  I missed IONOGEN, TANGENC(E) and RISQUE, so it could've been much worse.  There's a debate floating about Livejournal about how spread is/isn't an indicator of skill.  This is a small bit of evidence that yes, yes it is.
