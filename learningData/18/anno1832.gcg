#note i really hated leaving that H wide open. don't know what to do in these types of situations, but since the score is so close i'd like to go for volatility and hopefully give me a second scoring lane. i didn't see D11 ZONE which seems like an interesting play. N13 CIG sims best, and then O13 HER and HIE. i guess quackle doesn't like leaving it wide open. [-3] but it's such a crapshoot..

#note an INSANE play. i literally could not see anything better. i was scared of the lanes at the bottom. if he bingoes at the top i at least have a 3W to come back, but at the bottom he'll score 80 and it'll almost be a sure loss. that was my reasoning, turn over a lot, hope for that S or second blank and hasten the end of the game since i have a decent lead. C9 GOWNED is a nice play and sims best, along with a million other plays. [-13]

#note SO RELIEVED to draw QI. 15H AW has higher equity but after QI it's very hard for him to bingo.

>Cesar: AAEGTTT 1K AGATE +28 393
#note i figured tht AGATE was going to win. i don't see a disaster scenario but many games i'm sure he's going to bingo out and lose by 10. quackle does not like emptying  the bag. [-3.5]%. where's the disaster? i even calculated if i have BWVGTT on my rack and he bingoes out he needs a 71-pt bingo with ALLRST? and i don't see any.
