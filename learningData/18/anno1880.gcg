>Verna_Richards_Berg: BERV 8F VERB +18 18
#note You're placing it here why?
>Ryan_Fischer: EOPRRYZ G7 Z.P +27 27
#note Saw OY(E)Z of course, didn't want to give up the TLS.  500 4-ply has Z(E)P 4th.  OYEZ, ZERO, and PREY in the same spot are ahead.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: ?DEEFMO H8 .EFOrMED +93 111
>Ryan_Fischer: ENORRWY 11G W.RRY +22 49
#note 3rd after WOR(M)Y and (F)RY after 550 4-ply.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: CEOO 15D COOE. +11 122
>Ryan_Fischer: BDELNNO 10K BOND +18 67
#note Missed ENNOBLED.  Bleh.  All I could see was BLONDINE.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: AM 14F MA. +23 145
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKLNNU 12A UNLINKE. +79 146
#note Probably my worst moment of the tournament.  My head's just not in it.  What's worse is I see the D wide open after I've hit my clock.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKLNNU --  -79 67
>Verna_Richards_Berg: AAEGP 7I AGAPE +15 160
#note She does too unfortunately.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIKLNNU 12B LUNKIE. +25 92
#note WOW, LUNKIE(R)* is phony!  It's what helped me save a lot of spread later on.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: ?AIIINT B6 INITIA.s +61 221
>Ryan_Fischer: AJNQRTU A6 QUA +55 147
#note Bleh, how could I miss QAT for 73?  I was so fixated on finding a place for QUANT, I guess.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: ADEILNT M1 ENTAIL.D +68 289

>Ryan_Fischer: AAEINTY E10 YA. +20 224
>Verna_Richards_Berg: AEELORT 5H AEROL.TE +66 370
#note MAKE IT STOP!!!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINOST 2G ENATIO.S +83 307
#note Feels good to get one of my own.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: HO 1H OH +26 396
>Ryan_Fischer: CEINRUW 3I WIN +27 334
#note I saw the C(LUNKIER) hook and was glad to have finally drawn the C.  I wanted, though, to see if I could draw a bingo.  So I'd save the C to see if I could draw another tile to cash in there as well.  That's why I took WIN first.  REWIN is definitely another option, but not with my E the only one.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: TV H4 V.T +10 406
>Ryan_Fischer: CEFIRSU A12 CURF +53 387
#note Now, a tricky situation.  CURF or CUIF scores 53, emptying the bag.  This means I can't draw a bingo, and will have to hope to go out with the X in order to win.  If she has the X, I can't win.
>Verna_Richards_Berg: ISX 3E SIX +35 441
>Ryan_Fischer: DEISTU C1 DUTIES +26 413
#note DAMMIT, DUTIES has an anagram.  I missed 6 points for this.  A valiant comeback, just to fall short anyway.  And still, too many dumbass mistakes. She was very gracious and kind after the game, which makes it a bit easier to swallow.  Crazy game.
