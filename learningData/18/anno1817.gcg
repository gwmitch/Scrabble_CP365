#note oh sweet!  that 5 I saw played at Can-Am!  Oh, but there was a 7?  Damn, -49.3
>Mark_Rosenberg: AEEILRT F2 ATELIER +74 78
>Jeffrey: ABGHIOS E4 HA +19 37
#note Saw the best move, didn't like it for some reason, probably wrongly afraid of the H leave
>Mark_Rosenberg: FY I7 F.Y +17 95
>Jeffrey: BEGINOS D5 BIOGENS +67 104
#note ...not looking hard enuf for spots: -11
>Mark_Rosenberg: DENO 10B DO.NE. +14 109
>Jeffrey: ?AEIORZ J9 AZO +37 141
#note I knew both 8s but didn't try hard enuf to find them- too concentrated on the short play.
>Mark_Rosenberg: ADENNST 2C AND.NTES +61 170
>Jeffrey: ?DEIKRV -  +0 141
#note Grumble!  I knew it was an adverb, didn't think it goes -S obviously
>Mark_Rosenberg: HRTU C9 R.UTH +23 193
>Jeffrey: ?DEIKRV C1 D.K +16 157
#note didn't see the best play
>Mark_Rosenberg: BGI 11H BI.G +14 207
>Jeffrey: ?EEIIRV K3 VEInIER +74 231
#note knew the bes- play word, should have found it: -10
>Mark_Rosenberg: CEINSTU 5H CUT.NISE +60 267
#note hold and wise fail to chall.

>Mark_Rosenberg: IMO 1A MO.I +27 327

#note with II out there, I do not like the top play, rather ditch some junk
>Mark_Rosenberg: ANOPTU M1 UTOP.AN +20 347
>Jeffrey: GOOQSUX L1 XU +36 333
#note wasn't looking for best spot for this again, but keeping M8 open for me proved to be key: -15.2
>Mark_Rosenberg: AIL N7 AIL +5 352
#note ...so this is him blocking a big SUQ play, rightly, except i have them all over the board,so not final...
>Jeffrey: ?AGOOQS 13G A.O +8 341
#note this is where the static eval's SUQ.  I see his elementary outplay of JI(V)EY and know I have to block, otherwise I lose.  They dock me, but obviously it's the only way to win... 
>Mark_Rosenberg: EIJY 12A JE. +18 370
#note ...so now it's an out in 2, this is obviously his only play with a hope of winning, provided I don't see his outplay.
>Jeffrey: ?GOQS B8 GO. +8 349
#note Hehe, no such luck dude! This endgame wasn't that hard, but boy does it feel good to do it right!

>Mark_Rosenberg: IY I13 .Y +10 380
#note either this or the catty-corner G12 spot works
>Jeffrey: ?QS 4A QiS +30 379
#note ...as it stood, I didn't feel the need to take a chance on (ROUTH)S so I went for the 1-point win.  At least twice the scores had been mis- and re-aligned, so I felt pretty good about the math.  Boy did this (final, irrelevant to $) match elicit the puling!
