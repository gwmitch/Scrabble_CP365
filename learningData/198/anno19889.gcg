#note Of course BLINK 3C is safer, but the more aggressive play seems warranted when down 73.

#note Key mistake here - I tunnelled in on ditching the Q and didn't realize that TWINY 2B plays for 53.

#note An excellent play by Brett, limiting my chances to fish for a winning outbingo. I was considering the possibility of REPRIEVE before he blocked here.
>Evans_Clinchy: EILPRRV M10 .V.R +14 390
#note I spent a long time on this position, and I couldn't find anything better than EVER. I'm pretty sure I have to empty the bag because no effective one-tile fish exists - my only hope is to play two tiles, hope to draw the nuts and hold an unblockable bingo in two spots. This sets up EVERT so that A? wins - PLAITER and TRIPEDAL. Drawing O? likewise gives me POLITER and REPOLISH. This isn't much, but it's something. I'll be impressed if anyone discovers a better fish here.
