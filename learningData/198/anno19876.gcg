#note unfortunately, my second missed TWL bingo of the tournament - I was hoping he would put out a T, but somehow I missed the very similar word through the H...RAILBUS 2x2 is also an upgrade on my move.
>Brett_Smitheram: AEITTTW 10E TWAITE +26 58
#note brett's actual rack - as it turns out, I am not punished for missing AIRBRUSH because it would've given him ATWITTER.

#note worth sacrificing 17 points to keep the S or not? on this board, I actually thought so - there aren't a lot of scoring spots available if I don't hit a bingo on this board. my play also blocks some of his bingos. quackle says VIGS by 3 points, which is probably fair.
>Brett_Smitheram: ?DEGIOS 15D SOoGIED +85 235
#note brett can also play GNEIsSOID through the N and I, which is pretty sick

>JD: BEINOOQ 12K INBO. +28 243
#note I am in major trouble. I liked INBOX here to set up the nice Q spot with a good draw. I can also play QIBLA now which sims extremely close, but I think leaving the top part of the board more open is good.
>Brett_Smitheram: AK 14F KA +34 344
#note turns the big ZA spot into a slightly smaller one

>JD: ?ELNOPU B1 PLEUrON +78 367
#note well, my winning chances now exist, at least a little bit. apolune gave back too many cheap points and this way the P at the top gives me a new bingo lane to try to hit.
>Brett_Smitheram: ACLOZ A6 COLZA +58 441
>JD: AADEOTW 4J AWETO +30 397
#note entertainingly, I missed AWATO#, but actually AWATO is a terrible play because then he can bingo out with INFAMED# 2/8 times, which I didn't know was a word. no winning chances or fishes to play for that I could see at this point.
>Brett_Smitheram: ADDEFMN 4A F.MED +30 471
>JD: ADI 3M AID +14 411
#note a very short 10-turn apiece game. should've found airbrush, otherwise not much to change except maybe vigs
