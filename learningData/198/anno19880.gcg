#note YEASTIER is 77 but this seemed like the right situation to play more closed.

#note Sims best - it's good to keep the Z for a second big play later. The dream scenario here is hitting ZONED or ZINEB or something at 13I a couple of turns from now.

#note Ugh, a brutal spot. He's opening the triple and I have no way to block, or score much myself, or set up much of anything. Sim says to open the board with something like FANG C12 and hope to get lucky.

#note I didn't have nearly enough time to permute out all the endgames here, but the gist is this - I should be 2/8 to win here. The last tile in the bag needs to be the R or S for me to have a chance. If you go through the endgames, UNGET# 14A, NEGATE 2I and UTE M1 all win against his rack of AAADFOR or AAADFOS. Unfortunately my GEE play is 1/8, not 2/8. If I draw the R, my only outplays are UNITER/TRIUNE/TUNIER#/RUNLET, and he can block them all and win easily. Turns out this didn't matter, since the last tile was the A and I was screwed, but still a significant tactical error. My own fault for getting in time trouble.
