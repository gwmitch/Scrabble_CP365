>Olaugh: IQ 8G QI +22 22
>JD: ?DGHORS I6 GOSH +25 25
#note my first missed CSW bingo of the tourney. I've seen DROOGISH# before but not studied it. however GOSH sims very close.
>Olaugh: BDEMOT 10I TOMBED +26 48
>Olaugh: AAINOX (challenge) +5 53
#note wow, surprise hook! CSW loves indian food
>JD: ?DENRST 11C TENDReS +74 99
#note oops. should make other E blank. I was pretty nervous for some reason.
>Olaugh: AAINOX H1 ANOXIA +66 119
>JD: AABIPUV I1 BAPU +33 132
#note quackle will have to forgive me for not knowing PAXIUBA#, which is a little better than my play
>Olaugh: AIJO 10B JIAO +33 152
>JD: ADHIKVY M9 H.AVY +36 168
#note difficult rack. KHEDIVA# is new to me (the wife of a KHEDIVE)
>Olaugh: AEGUV K10 .AUVE +20 172
#note I think part of John's reasoning was that I might not know the MAUVER# hook. he also could have played VAGUED# at N5
>JD: CDEFIKL 14F FLICK.D +35 203
>Olaugh: EFGGU N5 FUGGE. +19 191
>JD: ADEEELW J1 AWE +38 241
>Olaugh: AENO 15E AEON +25 216
>JD: DEEILRT 15K RILED +36 277
#note if I think John is likely to challenged LIEDER it would be worth playing that - but RILED is a better play otherwise.
>Olaugh: MOOT O6 TOOM +40 256
>JD: EEILNRT M3 TRINE +25 302
#note Q says to play the E as well with RELINE or LENITE to increase my chances of drawing a useful tile like the blank or Z or S.
>Olaugh: EETW L1 TWEE +22 278
>JD: AELNOSZ D8 ZO..A +48 350
#note I was reluctant to play ZOAEA# because I picture him playing through the Z and forking the board. however, if I play TOZE quackle says that Olaugh has a decent percentage chance of hitting a 9 through IT or ON, so this definitely looks best.
>Olaugh: IRT 8A RIT. +39 317
>JD: EILNRSY 7B LI +8 358
#note quackle doesn't come up with it, but pretty sure my block is the best...he only has a 5% chance of bingoing (hitting RITZY)
>Olaugh: ?LPU E5 PULy +23 340
>JD: EEINRSY 14N YE +23 381
#note best is NIE and ZOAEAE
