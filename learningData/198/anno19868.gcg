>Abdullah_Abbasi: ABJU H6 JUBA +26 26
#note unusual placement! in retrospect, he might have been setting up the Z, which is cool
>JD: AABDNOR I2 BANDORA +78 78
>Abdullah_Abbasi: COZ H1 COZ +57 83
#note he put down the one for 61 at G7 but then picked it up
>JD: IILOORR J4 OIL +22 100
#note this play is way worse defensively than OOR because of how easy JOL# is to overlap. my CSW defensive instincts are not always finely tuned
>Abdullah_Abbasi: EOQTU K2 QUOTE +50 133
>JD: IMOORRY 7K RIMY +27 127
>JD: INOORTY (challenge) +5 132
#note this play sucks - not sure why I didn't find any of the good plays. just MOORY somewhere should work. I think I was trying to decide if NOOR* might be good.
>Abdullah_Abbasi: ACN G7 CAN +25 158

>JD: EIKOPSS (challenge) +5 215
#note there we go
>Abdullah_Abbasi: AFLO 8L F.AL +47 205
>JD: EIKOPSS L10 POKE +40 255
#note I may have actually seen POSIES at N10 and passed it up to save the Ss for row 10. should just play it, 54 points is too much to pass up and there's two blanks out
>Abdullah_Abbasi: EIT 10E TIE +11 216
>JD: ??IIMSS 11D MISSIle +77 332
#note I was way off my game for some reason. didn't even look for any of the easy double-double bingos on column E, and then passed up MISSILRY. not only that, but in CSW EMISSILE# is good so my play isn't even defensive. sigh.

>JD: AADNRTW O14 DA +22 528
#note best play is WARST#/REEN#. did not know WARST#. my endgame here was a colossal mess. I mistracked.

#note missed warst again. I have no idea what I wanted to accomplish with this play

#note Abdullah is a talented young player. too bad for him that the draw was so uneven, because he had me in time trouble.
