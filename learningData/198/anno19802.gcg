>Norman_Wei: EEENRTU 8D TREEN +12 12
#note quackle says : TUREEN,TENURE
me says: EE#

>Michal_Josko: EFGILNT 7G FELTING +79 79
#note no csw bingos here, 8 bingos on board available. this or 9g most points and no.1
>Norman_Wei: ?EOQTUY L3 QUEY. +34 46
#note coquetry 88, quietly 77.
queyn# no.4, nice find!
>Michal_Josko: AIILNRU D6 LI.U +4 83
#note quackle likes UNI# M1. I was about to play QUAI, but it would be obviously too offensive
>Norman_Wei: ?EORRTZ 9G ZERO +52 98
#note no 1!
ROZET# no.2 new for me
>Michal_Josko: AIKNNRV M2 KIRN +42 125
#note tough decision here. found most point play, quackle slightly likes better VINA ,VIN#( which i considered), VAIN in the same M row
>Norman_Wei: ?BOPRTY 10J PORTY +34 132
#note another nice # find. most points for that or BORTY. quackle still slightly prefers BY N1 or K4. i disagree with n row

>Michal_Josko: ADINOSV 5I DOV.. +18 143
>Norman_Wei: ?ABCDIM C9 MAC +17 149
#note DICAMBA lol?
>Michal_Josko: AIINNSS N1 NIS +30 173
#note thats no.1 for me and i dont care that quackle likes INNS,ANNS# and SIN same row. SIN would possibly open bingo line so definitely no for me. And INNS , losing 2 n's at this point could be costly too. So thank to COLLINS for NIS#
>Norman_Wei: ?BDEEII 11C .IDE +14 163
#note i dont know what i would do here. BEEDI,DIEB#,BRIDIE# seems to be good choices

>Michal_Josko: AHINOSW 10E OW +29 202
#note i consider one of my words that i mentioned in transition group - WHIO#
again tough decision, leaving ainhs looked strong to me.
also thought about HOW h4
WHOA NO.1
>Norman_Wei: ?ABEHIO 12F BOHEmIA +88 251
#note NO.1! - NICE FIND.
second option for 10 less - e1 BEHAVIOR
>Michal_Josko: ACHINST 11H CH +19 221
>Norman_Wei: AADEGOT H11 ..EAT +30 281
#note few nice collins choices - chado#,chota#,chode#
>Michal_Josko: AINOSTV 10A OV. +14 235
#note very behind now, risking a lot
still no.2 for quackle. would he risk too?
>Norman_Wei: ABDGORU A8 BR.AD +30 311
>Michal_Josko: AEIINST 4C ISATINE +69 304
#note only bingo available, one more space for it for 3 more points  which i didnt see 
>Norman_Wei: DGNOOSU H1 DOO. +15 326
>Michal_Josko: EFLRSTW 13G F.W +39 343
#note missed FELWORTS, which i seen somewhere lately. FEW is no.2 . also considered EF/NE/KIF 
>Norman_Wei: ?GJLNSU G3 J.G +36 362
#note JUSTLING(101!) and JUSTLING!
norman saw only homeless JUNGLES, and i noticed homeless JUNGLIS#. JUNGLIST# was new for me too(which i should know, if i knew JUNGLIS#), not sure if i would spot JUSTLING.
JIG# is 3rd quackles choice
>Michal_Josko: AELMRST O1 AT +19 362
#note martlets maltster 

>Norman_Wei: ?ELNPSU 1D PLUN.ErS +63 425
#note very interesting situation here, situation im not comfortable with. quackle prefers not to bingo here, because my letters can make bingo too and help me win. i guess quackle wants to me bingo first and then you can run out and win.
so how did the story end?
>Michal_Josko: AEILMRS 15C LAMIS.ER +61 423
#note and quackle was right. i bingoed too. MARLIEST for 22 more
Norman : "what the hell" :PPP
well,  good game
