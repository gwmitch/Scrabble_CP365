>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABBE 8G BABE +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIINV 9F VIA +14 14
#note I liked the defense here.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IIII -IIII +0 16
>Matthew_Larocque: AAACEIN J7 A.CIA +9 23
#note Hard play. AA 7I sets up the AE hotspot. 7J AECIA would be nice if I had a high point letter to use either of the hotspots. I ended up trying to get a little more turnover although this still sets up a hotspot.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DEGMU K3 DEGUM +22 38
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEENWY J2 YEW +25 48
#note I wanted to play WEENY but it's really easy to play a word ending in Y. I know, stupid reasoning when none of the plays are particularly good for defense, so I should just take the points. I think my logic for this YEW was that if he parallel played it creating AWE/OWE/EWE, I might get another comeback with a 5 ending in D or R. I play too scared sometimes.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EIP L6 PIE +15 53
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEINOR M6 OE +15 63
#note There's not really any good non-fishing plays.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EENOTTU 11F OUTE.TEN +66 119
#note Good find, Siri. One of those racks where if you don't see the bingo, you have to play for measly points and then you go downhill the rest of the game.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIKNR H11 .RAIK +30 93
#note There's more Rs than Ns left, but TAKIN and TANKA are the sim winners. I guess the difference in the leave values is too great.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DIMN 12C MIND +17 136
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOSXY 12K OX +38 131
#note Sim thinks I'm throwing away too many points - but I thought keeping a better leave was worth it. I'm not that far behind yet.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GHI 4J ..IGH +24 160
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOOSY G13 YO +20 151
#note Okay, this is too fishy for the leave. I didn't know SOOEY, but OYES is 38 points. Plus, if he has a strong play with an S, then I'd be in big trouble. A(N)YON M10 would have been cool if I knew it, maybe he overlooks the E hook?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IQ 13B QI +30 190
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHLNOS I1 HOLA +31 182
#note Lol, this isn't even a word.  Sim doesn't even like it, either. It's true that this S isn't doing a whole lot on this board after I kill WEIGH.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ORT 1F ROT. +21 211
#note Siri counters a phony four with another phony four. What division is this again?
>Matthew_Larocque: AENNRSU N4 .UN +16 198
#note Tack the S on?
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?CELRRS 14D REC..LeRS +66 277
#note Siri follows up a phony four with a nine letter bingo. I predict I won't be able to redeem myself nearly as well.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENRSV 15A DAVEN +35 233
#note Wasn't 100% on VANED.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DISTU 5E DUITS +20 297
#note NO. That's MY phony S-hook!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGNRST 2A STiNGER +74 307
>Siri_Tillekeratne: FZ C1 F.Z +28 325
>Matthew_Larocque: AINOOPW D2 .AW +23 330
#note I played this too fast. I need to just take the points with WOP. My win% goes waaay up if I play WOP. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EEFJS 6B JEFES +40 365
#note To be fair, I didn't foresee that kind of a play either.
>Matthew_Larocque: ILNOOPT 10L LOO +17 347
#note I'm not really sure what he has, so I just make a setup in case he doesn't go out.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ALR B6 .ARL +11 376
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (INPT) +12 388
#note Too much dinking around, some boards you just take your points and run. And I had no good reason to hang on to that S.
