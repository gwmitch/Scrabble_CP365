>JD: DEENQSU 8D QUEEN +48 48
#note in an unbelievable feat of synchronicity, JM and I both started 6-0, leading to us being in 1st and 2nd place, before BOTH losing our next 6 games to go to 6-6. outrageous. but now it was time to break the mirroring, unless we tied of course
>Jesse_Matthews: AFLOU 9F AFOUL +26 26
#note he almost played FOAL at 7G, which would've worked out very nicely for me
>JD: ADILRST 10D DIRT +18 66
#note my play probably is not fishy enough given the quality of my letters. quackle suggests DI/QI which bingos about 50% of the time.
>Jesse_Matthews: AGU 10I GAU +13 39
>JD: AAACILS D8 .A.IS +30 96
#note not a terrible idea here to just play QADI, but GAU could be a bingo rack with an S. this is much less volatile and taking a 60 point lead.
>Jesse_Matthews: AEIK C11 KAIE +24 63
>JD: AAACELN 14A AN.LACE +30 126
#note poor logic here - I didn't want to play ANLACE at 8J because of the bingo lanes that it opened, but this just offers jesse massive points for free. not only that but he will get to score points while cleaning up bad racks also. should play at 8J.
>Jesse_Matthews: ADDOU A10 AOUD.D +27 90
#note what does jesse do with this rack if I played ANLACE at 8J? the answer is, not much
>JD: ?ADRTWY 15G TAWDRY +53 179
#note epic draw power
>Jesse_Matthews: EGP 11K PEG +20 110
>JD: ?MSTVXZ B8 VoX +53 232
#note burning the blank definitely looks right. quackle suggests ZYMES at L8, but I love the long-term control of closing off the lefthand side.
>Jesse_Matthews: EELRR L7 LEER.R +19 129
#note ARGH jesse phonied me! totally inexcusable to let that happen in 5-point!
>JD: IMNSTTZ 8K Z.INS +42 274
#note missed MIZ# which is much better
>Jesse_Matthews: GJO 13G JOG +39 168
>JD: AIMNSTT N6 MI.T +12 286
#note quackle kind of wants me to fish and keep AIMNST, but that seems pretty maniacal given my 100 point lead
>Jesse_Matthews: FORW 7F FROW +33 201
>JD: ANNSSTV 11C ..NS +28 314
>Jesse_Matthews: EY 10N YE +31 232
>JD: AINPSTV 12H PAV +21 335
#note I can also just fish the V or play PAVINS at O3 to set up my case S.
>Jesse_Matthews: CEIORT O1 TERCIO +37 269
>JD: HINOSTT O10 .THION +39 374
>Jesse_Matthews: B 14N B. +8 277
>JD: EHLNOST N2 HO +22 396
#note I wanted to block EMBODIER/BIOMETER. for some reason apparently doing it with HE is better than HO.
>Jesse_Matthews: ?BEEIMO J2 BIOMEs +27 304
>JD: EILNST K1 TINSEL +30 426
#note definitely got the better of the tiles - poor jesse. not my best game management with ANELACE and ZEINS but good enough this time.
>JD:  (E) +2 428
