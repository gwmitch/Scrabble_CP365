>Steve_Perry: ABP 8G BAP +14 14
>JD: ?ANNSUY I7 S.UNYArN +64 64
#note I was quite proud of myself for finding the only bingo here (a CSW one no less) but I can definitely see why NY at 9F wins the sim - save a shot at a double-double and not giving back cheap points to the triple word score.
>Steve_Perry: JNNS 12H J.NNS +40 54
>JD: BCDENRU 9C BUNCE +18 82
#note bad logic on my part - the scoring potential around the J and SPUNYARNS scared me, so I opened the board further. but in the process I made my rack worse. I didn't know that BUNCE took a D, so I didn't find BUNCED at K10 which takes out some of the venom of SPUNYARNS. but failing that quackle just recommends BUND.
>Steve_Perry: AET H12 .EAT +36 90
>JD: ADIORRW E8 I.WARD +20 102
#note seems like I was just really off my game for some reason - missed the fairly straightforward WORDIER/ROWDIER to improve my rack. also missed ORDINAR# double-double which sims even with those two.
>Steve_Perry: AGV 8B VAG. +19 109
>JD: DELORXY D11 DEOXY +50 152
#note a nice substitute to playing well is drawing all the power tiles
>Steve_Perry: ALM C13 LAM +34 143
>JD: AELMRRZ F12 REZ +40 192
#note I chickened out of ALOD# here, which I think is fine given 5-point challenge.
>Steve_Perry: EINT 10G TI.E +11 154
>JD: AELMQRR K9 LAR. +13 205
#note don't care what quackle says here, surely this is a golden chance to seal up the board
>Steve_Perry: EGLT J4 GELT +9 163
>JD: ?AEKMQR I3 KAM +21 226
#note erm, MARQUEE 2x2 for 47 more points is surely too much to pass up
>Steve_Perry: AEFIOSW -AEFIOS +0 163

>Steve_Perry: DFIOOPT H1 PI. +21 243
>JD: FIIILOO 1H .OLIO +8 479
#note I need to block POETISED. quackle wants me to block with POI instead, because my plans next turn score much more on average.
>Steve_Perry: DEEIOST 15A DE.. +35 278
#note he should play TOISE at 5A first and save DEMY for next turn.
>JD: FIIO B2 FI. +12 491
#note I saw TOISE and blocked, but the way to do it is to play IO at 3B to set up IF/FIT for next turn.
>Steve_Perry: EIOST 11B IO..TE +26 304
#note nice play
>JD: IO 14M IO +12 503
#note further proof that it's better to be lucky than good sometimes - my first 3 moves were all fairly big errors, and missing MARQUEE was not spectacular.
>JD:  (S) +2 505
