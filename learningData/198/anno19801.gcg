#note My first time playing Christopher. It's cool to get a chance to play new people.

#note One of the most frustrating second turns in recent memory. I didn't see a way to keep EST. I didn't see a way to score points. I hated every single play I saw. I briefly layed down MO(V)ED, but I wanted to ditch a T and keep a vowel. Looks like F13 MOT is the play - those TWS squares scare me more than they should. I don't know, I'm starting to play Scrabble in super turtle mode.

#note Ugh.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHINSS 12C HI.ES +34 66
#note HI(V)ED? Close call.
>Christopher_Sykes: ABEIIKT 10A BAIT.IKE +68 118
#note Held this for some time. Thought I saw it somewhere. I probably did, as a phony. Too bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEENST A8 DE. +18 84
#note Super high-probability bingo miss after opponent phony, does not good Scrabble play make.

#note *insert sound of toilet flusing* - my chances of winning the game.

#note At least I didn't miss a 3x3. He said ANTISALE wouldn't have stayed on the board very long.

#note The X makes it too hard to bingo, I should play it now. Dumping it for 18 at M12 wins the sim pretty handily.
>Christopher_Sykes: CGNRU L8 CUR.NG +24 281
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGRXZ J10 Z.G +33 231
#note Now my bingo is going to get even further delayed. I need to give up the X obsession and play Z(A)X.
>Christopher_Sykes: ?ABLPRV 4H PRoVABL. +84 365
#note Game ovah.

#note I'm sure Christopher wasn't expecting WWU on his final draw. There's three other bingos, which all score 68 instead of 64.

#note A decidely brief game.
