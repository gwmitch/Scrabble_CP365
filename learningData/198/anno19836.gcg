>Brett_Smitheram: ??ACHLU 8G CLAUcHt +78 78
#note Brett wanted to bingo with duplicate letters in order to minimize my chance of bingoing back, and he also hoped that an obscure word might increase the chance of me challenging.  Though the word is low probability, it is good in TWL, and I was familiar with it.  However, it still gave him an advantage for a different reason.  I knew the word from the OSPD as a past tense of a verb, and I assumed it did not take the S or any other extensions.  But in CSW, CLAUCHTS# and CLAUCHTED# are good.  This means that Brett had these possibilities for the rest of the game, but I did not.
>Dave_Koenig: AEGHJOY 7I JO +36 36
#note Despite what static evaluator says, this play is much better than an underlap of HAY or HOY first.  Holding the H, I am likely to get first crack at the underlap, whereas in the other order, I risk getting stuck without something good to do with the J.
>Brett_Smitheram: AKMO 6J MAKO +27 105
>Dave_Koenig: AEFGHPY 9G HAY +47 83
#note PHAGE 9F is a significant improvement, not so much because of the two extra points, but because of how much more quickly it cleans out this rack.

>Dave_Koenig: EINNNTV 3G INVENT +22 182
#note Before Brett's play, I was just resigned to a play such as VENIN 5B.  However, OUK looked clearly like a fish from a bingo prone rack, so it made sense to take out the lane and score a few extra points, even though I burn some potential out of my rack.  I did not know VIENNA#, which plays nicely at K1.  Championship player ranks VENIN, VIENNA# and INVENT all relatively close together, but given the inference that he has a strong rack, I am happy to stick with my choice.

#note Very lucky for me that he dangled the R.

#note Quackle simulation prefers INWOVE 13I here by about 4-5 points over other plays.  WINNER is among a crowded group of plays that are all in a virtual tie for second place.  Why is INWOVE better?  Probably because turnover is very valuable here.  The remaining tile pool is good, without many awkward middle value tiles that would hurt you, and there are spots to score with the Q and Z and S's, not to mention the CLAUCHTED# extension.  Finally, with no N's and no blanks remaining, there is no risk of the INWOVEN extension to the triple.

>Brett_Smitheram: UY 2J YU +28 338
#note Interesting that he played this here rather than at J14.  It may be a sign that he is holding the Z.
>Dave_Koenig: DEFLQRW 14J W.LFED +42 388
#note I considered WOLFED or WOLFER.  There is one more D out there and no more R's.  The D risks ZEDS, AZIDE, and AZIDO, but the R risks IZARD#, ZARI#, ZERO, and DOZERS.  It seemed like about a wash, so I decided to just take the extra points.  However, WOLFER would have been the better choice for the simple reason of the CLAUCHTED# extension, which of course I didn't know.  It turns out that Brett saw all the rest of the E's anyway.
>Brett_Smitheram: ESZ O12 ZE.S +72 410
>Dave_Koenig: AIQRSTT M1 QIS +44 432
#note This is definitely the play that gives me the best chance, as I not only maximize my score on this turn, but also set up QAT to the triple that only I can hit.  Alas, his tiles were too strong such that I have no way to win the endgame.  But I don't know that anything else would have worked any better.
>Brett_Smitheram: DEEIILX N1 ID +23 433
#note This is fancier than he needed to be, but he still narrowly wins.  The idea is to block QAT, while setting up a second spot for EXILE at O2 and still holding EXILER 15F in reserve.  The immediate EXILER would have won much more cleanly, as would have the best play EXILE L11.
>Dave_Koenig: AOORTTT 15F ORATO. +23 455
#note I calculated that ROTOR lost by four after EXILE going out.  Then I saw ROTATOR, which was only a three point loss.  Then I saw ORATOR, which was only a two point loss.  But I couldn't get it any closer than that.  I suppose an open E for TATTOOER was a bit too much to hope for.
>Brett_Smitheram: EEILX 14C EXILE +20 453
#note This is the aforementioned two point win.  It turns out he has the slightly better EX L11, when after my out with ATT or TITI, he wins by four.
