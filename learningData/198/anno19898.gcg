#note Initially I thought a fishier play was a dumb idea, but I may actually be very, very wrong. Playing off an I yields a bingo with almost every single tile in the bag besides the I's. The R doesn't bingo, but it gives me QUATRAIN for 51. Since I didn't realize the potency of fishing here, I instead went for lots of turnover to draw the blanks. A pretty significant error, it turns out.

#note Not sure why the sim prefers the more defensive placement at 7C. I figured I needed some volatility since I'm at a tempo disadvantage now.

#note Thought about emptying the bag with SCROG# O11 and hoping to outrun him in the endgame, but that looked hopeless. I decided my only chance was to fish for a bingo and hope he doesn't block. This hits something playable in lines A and/or O with 4/9 tiles I can draw - the A for ENACTOR, the F for FUNCTOR, the I for bingos in two spots (CAROTIN or CISTRON) and the S in both spots too (CANTORS or CISTRON). Worth trying.

#note The W draw was not ideal, but at least this high-scoring play cuts some spread.
