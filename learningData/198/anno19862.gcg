#note his last play was obnoxiously timed to block my big play of CHOOK/CARBO. I figured that with no way to dump the Q I needed to play as many tiles as possible and try to draw QI at M2. a couple of other suggested choices are ECO at 2I, which can give me QAT unblockable, or BRACERO at F5 which is a little less dangerous and flips over an extra tile. Phil's rack is more likely to be a bingo than usual after HUE - actually, I think this leads me to choose BRACERO, because then if he bingos at the bottom I can still hook SHOOK, whereas if he bingos on row 14 after BRACE all of a sudden my lanes are not very good.

#note I dunno if this is the right play - it gives him some free points, but it's a good distraction from him trying to block my lanes. an alternative I missed is WEEP at 14B to set up a big S hook, but maybe I'm not down enough to feel like I have to make that play.

#note big error, I did not think of EMPARED# even though I may have seen it once or twice. it really would've prevented him from killing me with his next play on row 15.

#note like so
>JD: ADILNOS O3 SOLDAN +31 377
#note a really big miss, I should play SLOJD. this drops my win chances from 49% to 39%.

>JD: AIINOTZ 15A ZO +37 414
#note after lucking into picking up the Z I figured I was in good shape, but I underestimated the danger of him bingoing because of GU blindness. actually, I have one play that is far and away best - SITZ at B3 to block row 7. as it turns out, he still would've beat me by playing FIGJAM# (assuming he sees it), but I cost myself a lot of win percentage by failing to identify the lane.

#note should play TISANE to block IF

#note actually a pretty well-played day of scrabble for me - 6-2 was a nice reward. unfortunately, the end of my game with phil was my worst stretch of play. knowing EMPARED would've helped greatly
