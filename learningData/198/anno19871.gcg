#note I wasn't going to try HITHERS# unless I absolutely had to - it's CSW only. actually just playing SEZ at 1M is also better. ST blindness. but my play is still very strong on win percentage since I'm 90% to bingo next turn.

#note I was probably a bit too worried - spent a long time trying to find a different play than FEU at 14J, but even if jim bingos for 100 at this spot I can just block row 7 and the game will be over. I chickened out of PENE# at 13E which is a better play.

#note the definition of MONTEM# (which I didn't know) is too good: "A custom of Eton boys." wow

#note SAOLA# is the best play evidently

#note I need to block SOAK, but the best way to do is to play PLOW and save FUNDS for C1 next turn
