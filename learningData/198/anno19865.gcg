#note austin is a good player who beat me in 2013 worlds.
>JD: ADIKP J5 KID.AP +21 21
>Austin_Shin: ADINPQR K3 QAID +43 51
#note quackle agrees that I'm right to forgo QADI for 3 more points. I think if I wasn't holding the N then I should play QADI (this way, if he overlaps QI I get QIN back).
>JD: INOU 3K .UOIN +28 49
>Austin_Shin: EFNNPRV L2 F.NNER +33 84
#note definite error, should really play FIVER to block the easy scoring spots at the top right. FUNNER gives up 52 points per turn average versus 42 after FIVER.

#note wow, nice play! I guess he had RETEAMED also

>Austin_Shin: EEIRSUY E9 .URE +24 309
#note YU at 8A seems like a better try - I could hit SEVERITY or something if I'm lucky, and maybe I can try to hit some miracle double-double like NOSELITE or VASELINE in 2 turns.
>JD: OV B9 .OV +9 398
>Austin_Shin: AEILNSY C7 YE. +14 323
#note he actually blocked YEALINGS. this is why I should've played YU
>JD: INV B5 VIN +13 411
#note this play is actually not a 100% win for austin depending on his other letters - I think any bingo through the V in VIN like OVATIONS or EVASIONS wins the game for me.
>Austin_Shin: AILNOSS 13L OS +28 351
#note one tile off - would love to know what he picked from the bag!
>JD: AEOTTWY A6 TOY +26 437
#note best is YAWED at 7F
>Austin_Shin: AILNS 5B .INALS +18 369
#note not a lot to be done differently except for playing FIVER. 0-2 lifetime against Austin at this point.
