#note Lots of possibilities here. I can be super-fishy with something like GAU# for 6, or more fast and loose with BACULA 6H or ACTUAL D10. This seemed like a happy medium - relatively decent score and leave without opening anything too crazy.

#note Probably my first time playing this word - like not as a hook, just the tiles A-T-S off my rack.

#note This looks like a pretty clever play to set up my C, but it's actually a huge mistake. LOUS# is way better! It takes only the C in front instead of CFG, and the ACRST leave is much more likely to bingo than ACRSS. I need to get better at seeing possible hooks for CSW-only short words.

#note This sims best. The more open plays like OVARIAN are just kinda suicidal. I need to wait for a better situation to open.

#note I thought I was so smart for finding a pre-endgame setup that won 4/8 endgames! I just need to draw an E for ANKERITE/INTAKES, L for KALINITE#/ANTLIKE or U for ANTINUKE/UNAKITE. He can block both lanes with BAG and BELON/BOULE but that will just give me an eight through it. But - it turns out winning 4/8 endgames is terrible here, because I can just keep scoring and not worry about setting up a bingo. ARK G7, scoring 28 and keeping AINT?, is 100 percent to win against his weak endgame rack. We were both low on time and I wasn't able to suss this out.
>Adam_Logan: BEELNOU C10 BOULE +20 375
#note A rare endgame mistake from Adam! I believe he had me mistracked with AEIKNT? and thought I was guaranteed to win. Turns out all he needs to do is block my bingo.

#note Very fortunate to win this one.
