#note a clever and annoying play by alastair to block most potential bingos, except that I actually missed my second bingo of the tournament - SHEERLEG# to the G, which I've never seen before.

#note this play was not an easy find - TAVA at L6 isn't bad either, but with a deficit having more lanes should be good.
>Alastair_Richards: CDEIILN 1H IND.CILE +176 351
#note noooo. I had a read on him having a huge play, because he was frowning a bit while staring at his tiles during my move. sigh. nothing to be done

#note this could be an exchange, but the pool is really, really heavy on vowels at this poit.

#note I must say that I was rather surprised when this came off the board - I was resigned to losing by 324
>JD: AAEEILO 14L EALE +16 318
#note maybe blocking is the wrong idea, seeing that my tiles are not bad - I could use the extra turn to fish with CIAO, or even just exchange. but I thought the leftover stuff in the bag was pretty poor. probably I should fish for a turn and then block.
>Alastair_Richards: ?BEEGOW 13J BEGO +24 553
#note this play also blocks QIN, which is smart. he has the blank so if he does the pick Q he'll be able to play it off more flexibly.
>JD: ADIOOPT 2F PATOI. +25 343
#note COOP takes out some more bingos he could've drawn and saves QAT on the left, although he can probably find a way to block. my play just gives alastair more potent bingos
