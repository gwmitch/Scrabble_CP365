#note I liked this play because it forks the board, leaving ETHE# bingos on row 6 maybe if he blocks
>Calum_Edwards: AEY N1 AYE +26 365
#note wow, that's a lot of points to sacrifice!
>JD: ADFFRVW 8L FA.D +36 352
#note the double F didn't seem very useful here. need him to have garbage and to draw an E for FIVE/JOBE#. maybe time to get desperate and play WAVE at F4 setting up AWAVE?

>JD: EFIRRVW L10 F.VER +35 387
#note better knowledge of collins would've helped me find my best chance here: taking the points for FEW and then trying to draw RIVERY#. My odds of drawing EY or ?Y are 26/120 combined, which is a fantastic opportunity. of course, some decent fraction of the time he will block the spot, but still worth a go.

#note an 0-3 finish to worlds - didn't play too badly, just didn't work out.
