#note my first time playing Bahrain's lone representative. dead heat between OXO and ORIXA or AXION
>Irfan_Siddiqui: BO 7I OB +19 19
>JD: AGIKNRV 6F VIRGA +37 57
#note KIVA almost catches up by not offering a play to the R on H6. on the other hand, his last play suggests that he probably has mostly 1-pointers, so the sim values are not quite right.
>Irfan_Siddiqui: AEILRRT 9B TRAILER +61 80
>JD: AAEIKNV 8A VIAE +31 88
#note spent too long on this play for no particular reason. I also tried playing KAIE and IR, which would've ended badly. definitely worth me playing NAIVER - when he can't play on row 8 I could easily score 60.
>Irfan_Siddiqui: HLOP 7B HOLP +23 103
>JD: ACKMNTU 10G MACK +29 117
#note I am surprised that TUCK is only a point or two worse - guess AMN has much better scoring potential on this closed board

>JD: EEINNTY 3H .INETY +20 305
#note I burned a lot of the rest of my time choosing between NINETY at 14I and NINETY at 3H. Ultimately I figured I was taking out more bingos by blocking at the top of the board, which seems to be true (30% versus 24%). on the other hand, if he does get the bingo down I will need all the points I can get, and the bingos on row 14 are probably worth more. In retrospect I should play it at the bottom.
>Irfan_Siddiqui: ?AEFLRS 14H FALtERS +82 314
>JD: AABENUU 2J ABUNA +33 338
#note in this case, I would've had a slight lead instead of a deficit. the game is now a dead heat. I should absolutely play ABUNE instead of ABUNA to save the A for ANY. aside from that, ABUNA scores tons of points but also probably loses if he has the O (7/17) or J? (15%ish). all in all, I think a gamble with taking, especially if I play ABUNE.
>Irfan_Siddiqui: DEM L1 M..ED +22 336
#note I'm not sure if he should bother blocking - should probably just hope that I also missed on the J and O. he thought it was a J setup
>JD: ?DEJPUW L11 JEW.D +36 374
>JD: ?IPTU (challenge) +5 379
#note JEWED wins 34/36, blocking NONWHITE and THIONINE but loses to THIONINS when I draw TW (THIONINS is TWL, but I actually did not know it was good). At the time I was worried about outrunning WHO at 6B for 46 also, so I do need to score some points if I block. I did find a 36/36 win that Quackle failed to spot: JUdDER at M9 blocks the bingos and outruns if I draw two consonants. Actually, if I play JUDdER (putting the D next to the double word score instead of the blank) I lose two endgames (drawing NN and NW)!
