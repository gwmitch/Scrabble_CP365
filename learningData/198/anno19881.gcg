#note Sim approves. UEY#/UTU# is 6 points more, but this offers the superior leave and the YOUR hook.
>Abdullah_Abbasi: EFLT 11I LEFT +36 80
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EIJMRR G2 JIRRE +28 90
#note Oops, missed the LEFTE# hook to play this for 8 points more.

#note I've been wasting a ton of time every turn looking for nonexistent bingos, and Abdullah plays really fast. I'm already starting to run super low on time already, so I've basically given up on finding the best play every turn and I'm just slapping down something fast and reasonably good. MARLITIC for 84 is best here.

>Evans_Clinchy: AEGGKST 13C KEG +21 298
#note It might not be worth the significant equity sacrifice to play this instead of GAK# 11C. I knew this probably wouldn't block all bingos, but it might force him to play a weaker one that offers me more counterplay on one the TWS squares. This was a really rushed decision... wish I'd had more time to think it over.
>Abdullah_Abbasi: AEINORT 14C OTARINE +75 311
#note Well, that was a worst-case scenario
>Evans_Clinchy: AFGPSTU 15A FAP +33 331
#note Not sure. Maybe FUGS 6J for the leave or GUPS 15A for the points? I chose the in-between option...
>Abdullah_Abbasi: EPW C7 PEW +24 335
>Evans_Clinchy: AGRSSTU J2 SAG +22 353
#note Ouch, ZASTRUGA is a huge miss. I liked keeping the U for Q insurance, hence no SUG# over SAG, but... this is a 25-point mistake.
>Abdullah_Abbasi: EIL L3 LIE +14 349
>Evans_Clinchy: EINRSTU 15I NUTSIER +76 429
#note Another miss - TRIUNES making OONT# is 12 more. I was just rushed to get a bingo down.
>Abdullah_Abbasi: A 9B A. +5 354
>Evans_Clinchy: DELOTTU A7 LOTTED +33 462
#note Saw DUETTO# in line N with all the overlaps, but I needed this to block his easy QAID/QADI/QIN# plays.
