>Gerry_Carter: ??AILTV 8D VALIanT +74 74
>Dave_Koenig: ABJNRYZ G7 J.Z +37 37
#note I did not remember ZANJA#, which looks best here.  But this play is not too much worse.
>Gerry_Carter: EGGIRSW K8 SWIGGER +83 157
>Gerry_Carter: AQU (challenge) +5 162
#note I challenged SWIGGER, not VALIANTS.  They're both good in TWL.
>Dave_Koenig: ABIINRY 14I BI.YANI +28 65
#note I did not know the CSW-only spelling of this word BIRIYANI#, which plays at 10H.  Without that, I decided to play for maximum volatility to give myself a chance to come back.
>Gerry_Carter: AQU J10 QUA +69 231
#note It's not looking good for me.
>Dave_Koenig: DNOOORX L12 OX. +43 108
#note Oops, ONYX or ORYX in this spot was worth 11 more points.
>Gerry_Carter: ELS 15M LES +19 250
>Dave_Koenig: DEHNOOR 15D HONORED +102 210
#note Suddenly, I'm back within striking distance.
>Gerry_Carter: EILOU 14B LOUIE +25 275
>Dave_Koenig: AAFFMNU 9K .AUFF +15 225
>Dave_Koenig: AADMNST (challenge) +5 230
#note I missed this word in a game against Helen Gipson at the last World Championship, and I was happy to see him challenge it.  It's an awkward spot to play in, but I have no other way to clean out this rack nearly as well.

>Dave_Koenig: EEILOPT 13K ..PO +39 374
#note At first I laid down EXPEL in this spot, but then I thought better of it and changed to EXPO.  I absolutely need to bingo again, and the better vowel-consonant balance is critical here.
>Gerry_Carter: EINR O7 IN.ER +24 437
#note Ugh, a UW draw was about the worst thing possible, but I did not give up.
>Dave_Koenig: EEILTUW 5B WI.E +18 392
#note You need to take some big risks to come back sometimes.  Though there are two more T's unseen, I have to hope he doesn't have any, and that I can threaten something on the A line, while there is still one other line open.
>Gerry_Carter: ADP 4A PAD +17 454
#note He blocked NEUTRAL/TWICE, but all is not lost...
>Dave_Koenig: AELNRTU I2 UNLEAR.T +60 452
#note I hit my bingo!  But I'm still not quite caught up yet.
>Gerry_Carter: CEEEGIT C3 E..CT +28 482
#note It turns out best play is GEEP# A1 followed by OTAKU# 2E, which results in a tie!  Gerald plays the best scoring play, but he accidentally sets up a big out for me.
