#note dunno what I was thinking - this could be a smart play if I was deliberately trying to set up an S hook he might not know, but actually I'd forgotten VENDINGS# is good. should really just play EMENDING.

#note I think he might've been guessing on the hook! he seemed surprised at the challenge computer. I realized after I challenged that I'd seen this before.

>JD: AERRTUY (challenge) +5 185
#note I wasn't sure enough about KAYOES to play it (it's good in TWL). actually my best play here is an awesome word I've never seen before: SOKAIYA# (no -S), which has a rather interesting wikipedia article

#note quackle likes PENCE, which makes sense - more likely to draw new useful tiles instead of holding on to junk. I considered it but didn't play it for some reason.

>JD: EEMNPQR 11F .EMPER +20 296
#note In response to Stefan's fish, this is actually a nice time to drop the Q. I block a lane he might be fishing for and have great chances of drawing SPEARMEN/SPERMINE/PETERMAN#/PETERMEN#, although I didn't know the last two bingos. Of course, he may block my bingos if he bingos next turn, but there are no other promising places to drop the Q at all. TEMPER does cut into his bingo percentage a bit at least.
>Stefan_Rau: AI 12H AI +12 224
>JD: ABINOOQ 13I ABOON +22 318
#note oof, another huge miss - I didn't look for NIQAB# in this rack. NIQAB has the disadvantage of setting up a big S hook, but I will be up by 112, and his bingos should give me back counterplays on the triple word score line.
>Stefan_Rau: ?DEGIIS A5 DIGEStI. +86 310
>JD: IILLQUX B8 XI +20 338
#note it really would've paid off to dump the Q at some point on the previous few turns. LOX seems a little better than XI, taking away a scoring spot and saving a draw for LIQUID at B1
>Stefan_Rau: ADERTT B2 RATED +30 340
>JD: ILLNQUW 12L WILL +28 366
#note things were not looking great. RATED does not guarantee that he had an O, because he looked like he considered playing TARTED instead. but, he most likely just drew one. I figured that I needed to create a counter-spot, but the better way of doing this is the clever NOWL at L12 to set up QUILL on row 15. I can still draw the A from there if he blocks for QUA at A1. In the line I've chosen I am only relying on a lucky draw.
>Stefan_Rau: ORTW C7 WORT +26 366
#note I guess he was saving the other O for row 1? this cost him the game as it turns out - WORT on A1 wins against my rack. but that doesn't mean he didn't make the right decision.

>Stefan_Rau: DGINTU O10 TU.ING +21 387
#note oh god, my second phony allowed of the tournament. I even know what a TULE is. the funny thing is that he can just play UNGILT# in CSW, but still, why not challenge? : (
