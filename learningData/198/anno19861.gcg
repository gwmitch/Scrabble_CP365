#note interesting, he has JAKS/BOUCHEES or just JAK holding the S. did he just miss it, does he have another S or is he just vowel-heavy?

>JD: AINNOTY 10J YON +30 217
#note I can play ONY for 4 extra points but I figured I would need the new lane. quite likely he will just play on column I next turn and kill my bingo lanes otherwise.
>Craig_Beevers: WX 9C W.X +26 289
>JD: AAIILNT I1 ANI +22 239
#note I was a bit stumped. I played ANI at I1 hoping that I could still bingo on column J with a good enough draw. I think AIA at 13L is pretty clever, but the leave is much worse, especially with only 13 vowels left. quackle's favorite is just playing ALIT for 2, but then I am in trouble if craig blocks YONI. I think best is ITA at 15F which leaves the top of the board untouched.

>Craig_Beevers: CMO 9K MOC +18 386
>JD: DEILOST E4 OD +24 308
#note his last move surely means that he has an S. I can open the left side of the board, but it seemed fair to play as few tiles as possible and hope he misses his bingo.

>Craig_Beevers: BY 14B BY. +21 475
#note nice play - maybe I should've taken my points at 15A last turn.
>JD: IINOSTV 12J VISION +38 372
#note playing VINO at D1 instead leaves SITZ for next turn if I draw the Z. this play ends badly if I draw the V or the Z.

#note nice pre-endgame play by Craig to pick up some spread
