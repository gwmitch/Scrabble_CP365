#note Final game at club tourney. I'm 3-0, Jason is 2-1 and I have 143 spread on him, so I have to lose by less than 72 to still win. So I'm already in the mindset that I shouldn't really be trying to win this game, rather I should be playing as defensively as possible to a certain extent, to prevent a blowout.

#note This isn't the first time this game where I am stuck deciding if I should blow a million equity points to block a gaping threat. I decided better of that this time, and saw that the long-term defense of this play was just far too much to pass up for short-term defense (playing something blocking the AMOEBA_ spot. I also actually forgot that AMOEBA took an S, an E and an N rather than S, E and L.

#note little did I know, I had my own extremely improbably bingo occurence myself. Although given the circumstances, playing 15H UNSHUT could be worth it here!

#note There were quite a few options here. I had to address the biggest threats on the board somehow, it seemed. Those threats were, in my opinion, first and foremost, the X spots at 14J and 8D. Those bring Jason easily within striking distance of his 72+-point win goal. The problems with blocking those spots this turn are that 1) JAG does not at all infer an X, although it may be within Jason's range some of the time, and 2) I'm sacrificing my ability to address other threats by blocking one of the X spots. If I block the 14J spot, I am sacrificing turnover, which is important here since I want to end the game as soon as possible, and also leave value, ILMOQ being pretty bad. If I play 8A WA(U)L, I am getting rid of the less likely X spot while creating another threat, the 8 line I am creating at A8, which seems to be, all things considered, just as big of a threat as a play like EA(U)X or DO(U)X/RO(U)X.

#note Not sure this was my leave. I was pretty focused on this spot, I didn't really consider much else, so I'll consider this play a board vision error even if it isn't an actual error.

#note Jason said he played this cause it left the board in a better state than if he played through the P. Remember that he needs to win by a bingo and this only brings him barely ahead.

#note This play...
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEHINQ 13B HEE..D +32 346
#note This play was really really bad for me. Not only did it massively reduce the value of the play I was going to make, 13B HEE(DE)D, but it also did not give me any good plays. Now that the game is virtually tied, I have to make sure I can outrun Jason, since it would seem I am no longer a favorite to win. But that's fine, I don't need to win. I just need to lose by less than 72. But after his play, what is the best way to do that? I can't play Q(A)ID or Q(A)DI, that lets him score 60 points with his blank or S and leaves multiple bingo threats unaddressed on this board. I can play (A)HED and block the triple-triple, but then I can't respond to anything he does since I still have the Q and nowhere to go with it. I can play DIN(K) or HIN(K), since they block a lot of bingos and give me a spot for my Q, but they don't score a lot, and Jason can still bingo or have a huge X play. So I am in a bunch of trouble. I think HEE(DE)D was my best shot. Hoping he can't pulverize me in two turns, and allowing me to discard my Q virtually every time. Before VODKA, HEEDED was a great play since it got rid of the lane a play at 8A would create.

#note ok, that's not the worst that could have happened
>Joshua_Sokol: INOPQST 8A PO.T +28 374
#note Now that I'm just going to lose, I need to protect myself from losing too bad and block EA(U)X. Hopefully it will be enough.
>Jason_Li: AEIOUVX 14A VEX +45 441
#note We had both mistracked each other here. Jason lost 11 points in the endgame.
