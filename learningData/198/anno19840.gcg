>cesar: CEHNQST 8H TENCH +28 28
#note dang it CEHNST is an awesome leave! -Q! -11.5 .. but i was totally miscalibrated here as a variety of exchanges all sim ahead of TENCH. I think maybe the Q sucks.
>ed: KMOU L8 .OKUM +28 28
>cesar: FIIPQSV 11K Q.IP +30 58
#note ed wondered about my aggressiveness here but like does anything else make sense at all? QI keeps an awful leave. i have the S. i gotta play QUIP.

>cesar: AFILMSV O7 MAVIS +47 105
#note lol, i wrote down FAVISM on my scoresheet and was like nah. i've given up on ever knowing all the words. maybe when i'm in my mid 30s and satisfied with the rest of my life. -22
>ed: BERTT I4 BETT.R +10 63
>cesar: FFILOOR 4I .OFF +24 129
#note huh, i guess knowing words is important this game :( you'll see an even worse one later ... BOILOFF. -19
>ed: AEU 5K EAU +21 84
>cesar: IILOORR H8 .ORII +8 137
#note i didn't wanna play ORIOLE at 5D but maybe it's ok after EAU? no idea. maybe not. thought i'd keep the board more closed... -2.5
>ed: INOTT 5D TONIT. +12 96
>cesar: ELRU 4C RULE +16 153
#note keeping that on the board is one of the worst things i've ever done. i really hated it but thought i could still keep the board closed but i didn't even write down my leave so RULE is probably also terrible. 
>ed: GINW E4 ..WING +10 106
>cesar: CEOOPRV 8A COVE. +33 186
#note i was stressing out over this move for the rest of the game, but i lost this game on my very bad moves prior to this. first off COOP at 3B is wrong so no. i thought that i had made a tactical error by not playing M3 COUPE for the same number of points but keeping ORV instead of ERV. i'm still not sure if COVEN is an error, but maybe it's not as bad as i think. I'm heavily favored to win after it and the situation on lane 14 is actually super open.. so.. what do you guys think. is COVEN fine?

#note missed PYRO at 15A >.< .. wow i really played this game badly!! ROUPY M3 is also cool though.. only saw PROUD there for some reason. i was kind of speed playing the entire 1st day. this might have been my most unfocused tournament ever. -8

#note saw AGRYZE# but i'm playing the wrong dictionary
>ed: ?AADENS A5 DrA.ENAS +61 270
#note i guess this is why i was stressing out over COVEN...

>ed: OX 15H OX +42 312
#note great i'm gonna lose now
>cesar: AEENRUW 14A AW +22 304
#note is there any realistic way to win this game? AW/ABETTER seems to win slightly more games somehow?
