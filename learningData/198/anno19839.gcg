#note you know things are weird when 2G WIVE is simming best. maybe, MAYBE WAIVE. VAWNTIE 2D is also an interesting alternative. this is an interesting move and I have no idea what's best. I went for the points and volatility but it didn't work out. perhaps TWIN too? (-2)

#note i think this game might have gone differently had i found REEXPORTS. otherwise I need to do VOLE and keep a better leave. REVEL is kind of stupid .. one extra tile for the turnover and Us/Ss/blanks is not enough to justify MO over MER! MOVE F2 might be fine too... poor move, that. (-14)

#note beautiful play

#note REEXPORTS again, but at least it's a little closer this time. (-1)

#note none of this crap would have happened without... reexports maybe? who knows. why did tiramisu fit so nicely. C12 ODEA/ANOA sims best by far, and it's the clear spot but i was holding on to hope and didn't want to block the crappy B9 lane.
