#note the leave after FIX seemed most conducive to bingoing. IY after AXILE was hard to stomach, but that or NIXY sim signficantly better (5 points). bingo percentage after FIX is 15% versus 30% after NIXY.

#note I thought I was blocking his only outs, but this isn't the case at all. Not only do I give him FRIVOL but he already has ERVIL and VIRLS as better outs at the bottom-left. I was all set to play ABO before but the right play is FUBAR.
