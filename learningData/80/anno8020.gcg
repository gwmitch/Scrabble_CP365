>Chris_Cree: EHI 8G HIE +12 12
>Jim_Burlant: EENNVWY 9F WENNY +24 24
#note  This scores 28 at 7I, but that placement makes things too easy for him.    While only scoring 24, this limits him quite a bit.  The sim agrees.
>Chris_Cree: AAEMNQY -AAEM +0 12
>Jim_Burlant: ADENOSV H7 V..O +7 31
#note This was me getting cute. Q docks me 3 points, preferring 10D AVO, which I didn't like.  I wanted to set up my S and make it impossible for him to do anything if he didn't have an S.  Or, if he did have an S, this would fish it out.  This play turned things in my favor, as Chris told me after the game that it blocked his intended bingo of TAUNTER on the next turn.
>Chris_Cree: AENRTTU 10J AUNT +13 25
#note This is Chris's best play.
>Jim_Burlant: ADELNRS 11B DARNELS +74 105
#note Best bingo.
>Chris_Cree: ?EGIRTU L4 UtTERI.G +68 93
#note Sim prefers L8 TENURING and GENITURE. Is it really worth slotting the 3x3 for barely 4 extra points?
>Jim_Burlant: EGORSUW 12A WORE +31 136
#note Hmmm...Q does not like this at all, preferring 3J WOG 17 by roughly 4 points.  I realize GSU is nothing to write home about as far as leave  and that he could scoire something at 13C....but really - is this worth giving up 14 points on the scoreboard?
>Chris_Cree: EOQRT 4H TORQ.E +16 109
>Jim_Burlant: AGISTUY N2 GUSTY +50 186
#note Pretty good, but there were two better options I didn't think of:  N10 YAGIS and N10 YUGAS.  The N10 plays also score 50, and they don't potentially give as much back as this one does.  If I had played YUGAS, this might have turned out very differently, as you'll see later.
>Chris_Cree: CHOU O6 OUCH +32 141
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIST A12 .ADI +24 210
#note Board vision failure.  This is the sim runner up but the best play is clearly K4 QAID.  I didn't see it.
>Chris_Cree: ACEIV C7 CAVI..E +38 179
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEIST J4 .EE +5 215
#note In retrospect, this was a bad omen for much of how the rest of the tournament would progress:  a very ill-timed bad draw that caused my game clinching rack to come one turn too late.  Quackle prefers 10E AE 14...eh.  I also considered, but rejected, J2 AERIE because of those unseen F's.  Q doesn't like this much.
>Chris_Cree: ABDILOO 5B DIABOLO +72 251
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOST 12I AMOSITE +88 303
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOST --  -88 215
#note What goes around comes around; just as I blocked his TAUNTER early on, he's now blocked my AMOSITE.  Or has he?  How certain do I have to be about whether UTTERING takes an S to not put this down?  Of course, if I could have seen more than OM 6E or MOAT 4A and found DISTOME 14A, I might have taken the more prudent path and this game would have been much closer, win or lose.
>Chris_Cree: GMPR 8A GR.MP +39 290
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOST 4A MOAT +27 242
#note Safe to say I'm now rattled.  I'm still blind to DISTOME and any of a number of better choices.  Not finding 6E OM really put the final nail in my own coffin.
