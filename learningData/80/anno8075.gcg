>Andy_Kurnia: HIKO 8G HOIK +22 22
>Toh_Weibin: AAEGINS G8 .A +6 6
#note This is 2nd on CP's choices and I still prefer it to AE, which was 1st. Too much volatility with AE, IMO, and AEGINS gives quite a decent chance of a 4 timer next turn.
>Andy_Kurnia: GJO 10F JOG +33 55
>Toh_Weibin: AEGINST K5 TEASING +94 100
>Toh_Weibin: AADEMNO (challenge) +5 105
#note Nickel for HOIKS, which I wasn't 100% sure of anyway.
>Andy_Kurnia: ABGHI 11B BIGHA +31 86
>Toh_Weibin: AADEMNO L1 ADENOMA +80 185
#note Was thinking of playing MAKO J6 until I saw the bingo.
>Andy_Kurnia: OPRT 1H PORT. +21 107
>Toh_Weibin: AEFIORW H10 .OWFER +51 236
>Toh_Weibin: ADEINOW (challenge) +5 241
>Andy_Kurnia: DIMOY B9 IM.ODY +40 147
>Toh_Weibin: ADEINOW A12 WINO +50 291
#note I honestly didn't see WOAD, but I'm glad I didn't. WINO is a stronger move in my opinion.
>Andy_Kurnia: ETV A7 VET +20 167
>Toh_Weibin: AADEELX M2 AXED +51 342
>Andy_Kurnia: LLU D11 .ULL +10 177
>Toh_Weibin: ACEILTT C3 LATTICE +76 418
#note LATTICE/ TACTILE anywhere score the same number or points. This is obviously the best option, in that case.
>Andy_Kurnia: Q I7 Q. +21 198
>Toh_Weibin: ?EIPRRY 13H .RIPpERY +82 500
>Toh_Weibin: ACDEOUU (challenge) +5 505
#note Probably learnt this from a Word-Of-The-Day feature.
>Andy_Kurnia: FT 2L ..FT +16 214
>Toh_Weibin: ACDEOUU O1 U.U +9 514
#note This was just me being greedy (and safe). I didn't want him to play a 9x with the Z, which seemed possible with the esses and the blank in the bag. COURE is otherwise a -duh- play, but who cares about 26-point moves when you're so far ahead?
>Andy_Kurnia: IN 2H IN +8 222
>Toh_Weibin: AACDENO O8 DANCE. +39 553
>Toh_Weibin: ?ABEORS (challenge) +5 558
#note At this point, Andy was giving 5 points to any word he was remotely unsure of. Was considering DANCEY or CYAN which would be a better blocker. DANCEY is obviously stronger since there are no As, no Os and so many Es left in the bag. Oh, by the way, there's ?SSSZ left too.
>Andy_Kurnia: EINZ D1 ZEIN +52 274
>Toh_Weibin: ?ABEORS 15H .EBOARdS +80 638
>Toh_Weibin: V (challenge) +5 643
#note Also REAbSORB. I could have played a fish here which might net me more score for an out bingo but I wanted to secure 600 points.
