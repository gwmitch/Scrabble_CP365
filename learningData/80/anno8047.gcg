#note little did I realize that this move would cost me the game! I totally wasn't considering AFOOT. LEX is significantly safer. I wanted to play here because I thought the Q and Z were most likely to hurt me on row 12 but instead I set up an even bigger spot...

#note jeez! great play.
>jd: AELMOOU 1F ALOE +29 384
#note this play sucks since it doesn't really give me a specific way of winning. quackle's suggestion of OUZEL sets up some big hotspots that I have a shot at doing damage with.
