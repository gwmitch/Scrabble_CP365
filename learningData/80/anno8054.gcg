>Bob: ILLTW 8D TWILL +18 18
>Matt_: AGINNPV E8 .AVING +26 26
#note Things started slow, but that would change in a couple of turns.
>Bob: TX F7 T.X +19 37
>Matt_: ACIINPY 12B PYI. +18 44
#note Didn't know TWILLY takes a #-Y back hook.  I played PYIN instead of PINY because of the S hook, but I'm getting burned either way next turn.
>Bob: ?OPZ B10 Zi.PO +74 111
#note He said he had the second blank at this time as well.  PINY saves me 20 points in this case.
>Matt_: ACEINOT 9H ACONITE +65 109
#note Also ANOETIC#.  
>Bob: ?DEEGLV N2 sELVEDG. +88 199
#note Nice find by Bob here.  I challenged since it was only 10 pt. penalty, and was hoping to play TUNNIES in column O.
>Matt_: EINNSTU 2H SUNNIE.T +59 168
#note NOUNIEST# scores 3 more.  PUNG 13B 26 is an interesting option as well.
>Bob: IQ L1 Q. +21 220
>Matt_: AEIORRS D1 ROARIES. +68 236
#note Yay Collins!  Bails me out of a tough spot.  Bob good-naturedly complains that he's drawn both blanks, QXZ, and I've pulled ahead anyway.  
>Bob: AAADEIO 10B .A +11 231
#note Fishing for something obviously.
>Matt_: CDFHKRU 2B FR.CK +48 284
#note I'd really like to play along row 8 through the G, but UGH keeping that junk just wasn't worth it, so I decided to score.  Had he blocked FROCK I probably play the POO list 6 at 6J.  

>Bob: ABELRST O9 STABLER +96 327
#note He thought ZIPPOS was phony, hence why he played this at O9.  Of Collins note: TABLIERS# for 72 and BRANTLES# for 70.
>Matt_: ADHHOOU 1A HOU. +28 312
#note Keeping the 2nd H to score next turn as well, eschewing HOHA.
>Bob: EMU N13 EMU +22 349
#note I guess he was shutting down bingo lanes, although there are still plenty available.  Playing this at 1H scores 5 more.
>Matt_: ADHORSY 1G HOY +38 350
#note DYS(C)HROA 81!  I didn't pull the trigger on 15A ASHY because I figured ZIPPOS must be no good.  Would have scored 70 as Bob said he'd have challenged it.  This ended up working out anyway.
>Bob: EOW C12 .OWE +33 382
>Matt_: AADJNRS A14 JA +40 390
#note JINDAR* was sticking in my head for some reason, must have cross-pollinated JANDAL# and QINDAR.  Taking the points here is the way to go.
>Bob: FOR 4L RO.F +22 404
#note Blocked my 2x2, but he can't block all of my bingoes.
>Matt_: ADGINRS K6 DAR.INGS +70 460
#note Though about RAIDINGS#, but went for the sure TWL bingo.  He held for a minute before accepting.  Good to note that WAVING does take an S in Collins.
>Bob: BEIOU 12H BOU.IE +24 428
>Matt_: AADEENT H11 A.ATE +21 481
#note CTENE# blocks his best outplay.  If I'm playing here, ABAND# is better.
#note IDEM 3F scores 32.  Not the best played endgame, but still a fun shootout to get things started.
