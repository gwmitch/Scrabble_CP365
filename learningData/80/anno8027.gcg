>Matthew_Larocque: AAOPQST 8G QAT +24 24
>Mike_Ebanks: INOR 9G IRON +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: AOPRSSU 10A UPSOARS +79 103
#note Didn't know this bingo had an anagram. Always good to get a head start on Mike Ebanks, he always gets early bingos on me...
>Mike_Ebanks: AJP A8 JA.P +39 62
>Matthew_Larocque: DEILRTV K5 DRIVEL +25 128
#note This one is pretty reckless, and Quackle knocks on it for that. Suggests VI(O)LET.
Sometimes I'm just in the mood to try volatile plays, especially if I'm starting out with pretty good draws.
>Mike_Ebanks: UUVW -UUVW +0 62
#note Impeccable timing!
>Matthew_Larocque: AACEFST 11H FATS +36 164
#note Need to look harder for those compound word bingos. Probably better to keep the T here, or at least play FAST so he doesn't get easy TWS points.
>Mike_Ebanks: AANU H11 .AUNA +27 89
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFMOW I13 MOW +25 189
#note Holy crap WAMEFO(U). Or COW(P)EA. In terms of words I know, MOW seems pretty good. I have a decent lead so can't let the board get out of control open.
>Mike_Ebanks: EE 10I EE. +14 103
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEFIIT 8K .ATIC +33 222
#note Yeah I know I'm opening it again, but for good points and it unclunkifies the rack a little bit.
>Mike_Ebanks: BO G13 BO +20 123
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEFIIY 11D FIE +23 245
#note I remember spending a really long time on this play. I was worried about the S in UPSOARS. I didn't really see anything else, missing EDIFIE(D), and not knowing DEIFIE(d).
>Mike_Ebanks: ?IKLRST C3 SKILTeR. +76 199
#note Damn, I KNEW this was invalid. If I have a decent counter, I'm more inclinded to let it slide, but still...
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEIOUY 4A YO.ED +34 279
#note Tricky find, FATS(O).
>Mike_Ebanks: HN M7 N.H +11 210
#note What's going on on his rack....
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEIRTU A1 BUR. +27 306
#note BE(D)U for pure balance, but I want to keep scoring decent points here.
TEREBI(NTH) if you're a real word nut.
>Mike_Ebanks: NY 15G Y..N +18 228
#note Welp he still needs vowels I guess
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGIRT 12B GET +20 326
#note You mean G(L)EETIER is actually good? Good grief.
>Mike_Ebanks: EGL B12 .LEG +12 240
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEIOR 3E OREIDE +13 339
#note Kind of a stupid play, and I felt stupid playing it. The game was going pretty slowly and I just wanted to get it finished before Mike caught up. Quackle wants me to fish, but I don't feel like my letters are really worth fishing with.
>Mike_Ebanks: AENZ H1 AZ.NE +45 285
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILMOV 15A O.IVE +39 378
#note This or MOVIE for 42? Champ says neither, instead close down the O column with VOMI(C)AE. I didn't know that one, but scoring points will probably still net me a win most of the time.
>Mike_Ebanks: CEINW 2J WINCE +49 334
#note Suppose MOVIE would have been superior because it's so easy to score points up here.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ALMOTU 6E AMUs +25 403
#note Ignoring the bingo, there's a good number of superior plays here. Need to learn more short words - but I should have seen WINCE(R).
>Mike_Ebanks: DGHIX 14A H.X +27 361
>Matthew_Larocque: LOT 1A .OLT +7 410
#note (C)OLT or (C)LOT

I always run my clock down to the wire, damn me.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (DGI) +10 420
#note Mike with 359, too lazy to find out why.
