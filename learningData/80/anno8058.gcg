>Jeremy: ?GLOOOT D1 OnTOLOG. +74 172
#note -2.9 D1 TOpOLOG(Y).  Also TOpOLOGY TOcOLOGY TOkOLOGY and OTOLOGy play.  I only saw the last one of the options.  Mark was already getting pressured for time so I didn't take too long thinking. 
>Mark: AABIMN 1A AMB.INA +33 228
#note I thought for sure a triple triple now, but he stopped one short.  A tad risky.  It's a race to the first S.
>Jeremy: EFFILRV 14I RIFFLE +35 207
#note Quack goes with B1 (M)IFF on win percentage, and 14I FIVE on valutation -0.4. It's very close.  I don't mind adding a second hotspot to improve my chances of hitting one of them, and turning over six tiles to hit one of them. 
>Mark: AAW E3 AWA +23 251

#note -6.3 3A VIT(TA)TE.  Missed it.

#note Brain: "Try STUDDI(L)Y". Me: "Shut up brain."  Never listen to your brain.  It trickses us.
>Mark: EEINORS 2H .IONEERS +74 368
>Jeremy: AQSTTUU 10B QUA.T +36 386
#note 12.9 N10 QUAT(E) for 3 more points, and about 18% better odds to win.  Is this that bad?
>Mark: IOOZ 12K ZOOI. +30 398
#note QUARTZ didn't happen, or it may have been worse.
>Jeremy: DKNPSTU K9 PUT. +30 416
#note 3H (I)NPUTS on win percentage.
>Mark: ENW L1 W.EN +22 420
>Jeremy: DGHKNST J5 H.NG +8 424
#note I5 D(A)KS is the only win according to the duck.  Mark goes out with 4J LU(N)IES and I win by 1 point.
>Mark: EILSU O1 I.LE +15 435
#note 4 wins and a tie here.  I9 LEISU(RE) 10B (QUART)ILE 9H SLI(P) 9H LIS(P) and 11B ISL(E) for the tie.
>Jeremy: DKST G6 ...KS +36 460
#note Whew.  I was going to do T(S)KS next at O1, but since that got blocked I found my winning play.
