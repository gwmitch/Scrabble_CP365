#note winning the battle of "low-scoring two point fishes". a pyrrhic victory if there ever was one. tanuki sims pretty even.

#note the terrible leave after any play on column O scared me, but my play sucks. I didn't think of OVA at O6 which leaves a somewhat tractable set of tiles.

#note my play seemed like a good try, but championship player suggests it only ends up winning one of the endgames if both sides play it right. however it is the best play of the bunch.

#note if she wants to get cute she can actualy play REIFIED at 5D to block both of my ILEA spots. this play does the trick though.
