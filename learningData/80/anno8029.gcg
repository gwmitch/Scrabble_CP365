#note Wasn't sure what to here, but figured it would be best to keep a consonant and the hook. Quackle likes just playing PAEON.

#note I also considered REPAVE N1 but that's too dangerous for five more points, and ER > EN anyway. Hence I was surprised Quackle prefers that play a large margin (5%) over mine.

>scott_jackson: EHIORRR E2 REHIR. +18 129
#note I was kind of lost here without a D available, but I figured I had to get rid of two R's. However D9 ICHOR scores enough to be worth the somewhat worse ERR leave. My play is pretty low on the list.

#note I thought this was pretty bad, but there's no good move that clears up the G's very well. C12 ORCA is best.

#note A8 SToLPORT 86, one of my favorite words (it's an airport with short runways)
>scott_jackson: BORRUVZ -BORRUV +0 321
#note While this looks bad (especially since I an just play BORTZ) it actually sims very well 4-ply. 81% vs. 83.7% for BORTZ. Even if my opponent bingos again on the next turn to catch up she'll be drawing into absolute dreck, while I'll be drawing six into a very good pool.

>scott_jackson: ?EGINRZ N1 ZI. +28 349
#note With only one A left and the pool how it is, I'm not really worried about what my opponent will do in the bottom right. My goal is to draw as little out of the bag as possible. Quackle likes 9M ZED which even further minimizes the chance of a bad draw. I actually mistracked and though all the A's were gone - if I realized one was left I would have played ZED.
