#note Joel said something along the lines of "Since exchanging five worked so well the first time, I'll try it again!"
>Dave: DNPRSTU 6D DUPS +35 64
#note It's a close call whether to play or hold the S here.

#note Joel took a long time on that play, while I tried hard to remain calm and not betray what I was holding on my face.

#note With a 219 point lead already, it might seem this game isn't of much interest.  It's true that Joel never came close enough to really threaten me, but the relentless way he continued to pour on the points for the remainder of the game is quite impressive and entertaining.  Playing well in these situations in order to conserve spread is an important element of strong tournament performance.

#note I can afford to play defensively and not chase after maximum equity here.

#note Joe Edley pointed out to Joel after the game that he missed a bingo through IN.  After the hint, it did not take Joel long to find MEDICINAL.

#note It appears that UNS J6 followed by ZIT is Joel's best continuation here.
>Dave: LR I10 ...R +9 499
#note Joel pointed out to me here that I missed dropping the R at N2 here for 3 more points, a possibility that I had thought of a turn or two earlier but had forgotten about.  However, we both missed the best place for the R: L6.  If I had found either of those plays, this would have been my third 500 game in a row, after putting up lopsided scores against Weinstein and Luebkemann.
