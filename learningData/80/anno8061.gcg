>Dave: AADEINR 9I ARANEID +65 65
#note This is undoubtedly the best placement, both because the D is much harder to triple-triple through in second position than seventh, and because the row 7 placement gives up big Q and X plays.  However, it turns out that with Joey's particular tiles the other placement was better.
>Joey: CFILORS 10C FROLICS +69 85
>Dave: EINOORX 8M OXO +50 115
>Joey: GOPPRTW 7J GROW +22 107
#note Not so good.  GAWP K8 is much better.
>Dave: ?EINNRU E4 pREUNI.N +78 193
#note There's not a big difference between this and REUNIONS, but I prefer this.  Why this when there are three S's to hook it, but only two P's for the front hook?  Because if he's going to hook it, I'd rather force him to spend an S which could be useful elsewhere to do so.
>Joey: CMPPRTT -CMPPT +0 107
>Dave: EINQSTV 12C QIS +32 225
#note Admittedly, I didn't think about CIVETS at all, which is the equity play.  But given that I already have a sizable lead, I like playing this way better to keep the board tight.
>Joey: AEORTUU H10 .OTEAU +27 134
>Dave: AENPTTV C12 .AT +24 249
#note Eh, this is pretty lame.  INAPT G10 is much better, both for equity and defense.
>Joey: JORU K3 JURO. +24 158
#note Apparently I forgot what I kept here.
>Dave: EEENPTV 3K .EEP +26 275
#note It's a pretty small difference between this and VENUE, smaller than Quackle would lead you to believe.  Holding onto the V can be useful for blocking things up later.  The bigger problem with VENUE is that it gives him the possibility of creating more openings with a play from H1, while still keeping the bottom of the board wide open.  If I were behind on score, I would seriously consider PEEVE 6C.
>Joey: HOSW 8A SHOW. +45 203
#note More incompleteness, but I needed a play like this.
>Dave: ADENNTV K9 .DVENT +20 295
#note I like the way this closes the board, but if I had seen VAUNTED 4I, of course I would have played it.  Basically, this game was an embarrassment of riches, and I didn't need to find my best plays to win.
>Joey: AEHILLY 14A LA.ELY +34 237
>Dave: ?AADFGN 6B FAN.GADa +74 369
#note First I saw FANDANGO, but this was much better defensively, both to avoid opening the triple-triple and to block the A column.
>Joey: EHIPY A11 PHY.E +51 288
#note Unless I missed a bingo with whatever else I kept, this can't be all that bad.
>Dave: DEIKLOT H1 KILTE. +36 405
#note Don't blindly trust Quackle's static evaluator without considering other factors.  This is much better than KELOID both because of the remaining pool (two T's, no O's) and because it avoids giving him an open E.
>Joey: ABBEGIR N1 BA. +14 302
>Dave: CDIIMOU 2E OID.UM +17 422
#note Even a bingo isn't going to catch me at this point, but there's no reason to leave easy stuff open for him.
>Joey: BEGINRS 13G B.GI.NERS +84 386
#note I still can't believe I drew this, even though I was fishing for it.  There was less than 1 in 100 chance.
