>Dave: CEGOPTU 11D COUG. +22 34
#note Keeping PET instead of GET here seemed worth the two point sacrifice.  Quackle agrees.  The fact that the C prevents parallel plays on row 12 also makes it harder for him to block the board.
>Bruce: ALX J5 AXL. +27 113
>Dave: ?EEPRTU 5E dEPUR.TE +86 120
#note I was all set to play SUPERjET before he gave me a better bingo.  REUPTAkE is perhaps a tiny bit better than this, both because it slots fewer vowels and takes fewer hooks.  However, since the board is so wide open anyway, it's not necessarily bad to keep increasing the volatility.
>Bruce: DOV F2 DOV. +12 125
#note This seems like a strange play, both because the same word could have been played at L2 for 4 more points and because the D could be used to hook DEPURATE.  
>Dave: INSSTUY M2 NUTSY +26 146
#note UNITY and STY score enough more than this to probably be better choices.  That being said, there is value in taking the DEPURATE hook before the opponent does.
>Bruce: EGIMNOS 2C SMI.GEON +64 189
>Dave: BEINRSZ D8 ZIN.S +52 198
#note AZINES scores two points less and keeps a slightly worse leave, but avoids slotting the Z.  Is it better?  Not when the H1 spot is wide open like this.
>Bruce: ACJK 1I JACK +33 222
>Dave: BEHIORY 3B HOY +29 227
#note Missing OYEZ.  Although this has a better leave and the board is still open for bingos, that's too many points to pass up.

>Dave: AEGLOVW G5 .LOW +22 409
#note Fortunately I had plenty of time to work out this endgame.  This is the only play that Quackle comes up with that it thinks wins.  It blocks both NIT 6F and PINT G5, while threatening to go out.
>Bruce: INRT 14K .IRT +10 419
#note This is a tough situation for Bruce.  Quackle finds a couple of ways to make it a one point loss, but nothing better.  TIT 11K, blocking the out and setting up RIN 12L is one way, but DEVA seals the win.
