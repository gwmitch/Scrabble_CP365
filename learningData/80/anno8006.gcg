#note All easy choices so far. This is significant because Adam plays lightning fast and keeps pressuring my clock.

#note Deciding not to open up a Q/X hot spot with LIENTERY.
>Logan: ADFIR 1D AFR.ID +33 175
>Tunnicliffe: EGOPTWW O1 W.W +27 262
#note GAWP is miles better. I was about to play it, but then had a sliver of doubt. Against Adam I always seem to let the sliver of doubt win.
>Logan: EHP F4 PEH +37 212
>Tunnicliffe: EGIOOPT E5 POO +28 290
#note I saw PIGEON and POTION, but for some reason they felt defensively weak without really improving on POO's score. But news flash: POO also opens up the TWS. PIGEON is significantly stronger.
>Logan: ABJU 2B JUBA +35 247
>Tunnicliffe: EFGILOT 14A FOIL +27 317
#note Shuts down a ton of bingo lines. Gives me the best chance to win.
>Logan: AEX 3J AX.E +46 293
>Tunnicliffe: EEGINOT 8A TIGON +27 344
#note This is a werid play. It wins the sim quite handily. But It felt like I was undoing the work I did last turn. However, I need to keep scoring, since Adam is constantly pressuring even without a bingo. TIGON forces Adam to bingo, but ensures that bingo will only score 60 or so.
>Logan: DQU B6 QU.D +34 327
>Tunnicliffe: CEEINSU G10 ECU +14 358
#note I hate this play. What I wanted to do was shut down the last bingo lines. But what does ECU do? Barely weakens the B and doesn't even touch the A. That said, ECU does actually sim second best, miles behind the star play. That play is C4 CUING, which shouldn't have been hard to see. Not only does it score points and unload the U, but it kills the two spots on the board which will dominate the endgame. CUING = 75% to win, ECU = 64%. What a bad time to miss such an easy play.
>Logan: ??GINST 14F be.TINGS +61 388
#note Adam spent about ten minutes here. I'm glad he didn't fish and then make me decide whether BANISHED was a terrible play. At any rate, I am not doomed here. Go ahead and play my endgame. I accomplished something significant in leaving ~11 for the endgame, since Adam has been putting me into time trouble in all our previous games.
>Tunnicliffe: ADEHINS 3C HAD +36 394
#note Unfortunately, I mistracked. I spent five minutes playing the endgame with AIORST unseen. Then, for shits and giggles, I decided to double-check my tracking. Crap, the A is an N. So then I had to replay the endgame with 6 minutes. Still enough time. My first though was that I needed to underlap JUBA first. Adam has too many points there with ROTS, and I won't be able to keep pace. The problem is that once I recalibrated my endgame to account for the N I now knew about, I didn't recheck all of the hot spots. I failed to consider how many points Adam could get playing parallel to QUOD. My winning and tying endgames do not block the JUBA underlaps. They play parallel to QUID and threaten enough points the next turn.
>Logan: INORST C6 IN.OTS +27 415
#note SIN(G)E, threatened HAD in two places was a very, very findable tie. And I shouldn't have had any trouble seeing it. This endgame failure was a combination of mistracking and tunnel vision. One of these days, I would like to correctly play and endgame and win a game as a result.
>Tunnicliffe: EINS 12K SINE +17 411
#note My winning endgame was cleverer, though. HIN(G)ED, threatening S(H)A(PES)! Even if Adam blocks, I eke out a win by 3! Awesome! Blah! I wish I didn't blow this endgame.
