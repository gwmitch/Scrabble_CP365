>Mike_Baker: DGLO H7 GOLD +12 12
>Verbie: AIOORUY 9F OI.Y +12 12
#note Should have seen AUDIO 10F.  (-7)
>Mike_Baker: ADIQ E6 QAID +23 35
>Verbie: AEEFORU 6C RO.UE +16 28
#note Between this and URAEI/ AUREI 8A, it's a tough call.  I decide that dropping the O is worth the 2 point sacrifice.  (Q says:  Darn close.  -.3)
>Mike_Baker: ?GGILNN C3 GNa.LING +72 107
#note I wasn't going to be stopping much- he staill had DaNGLING 10h.
>Verbie: AEEEFOU 4A FA.E +22 50
#note Not a mistake per se- just .2 behind EAU B9
>Mike_Baker: ACL A1 CAL. +27 134
>Verbie: AEENOUX B10 AXONE +33 83
#note Comfortably best.
>Mike_Baker: AEMNRST 15B SMARTEN +93 227
#note Missing the A6 is going to cost more than 3 points...
>Verbie: ?AEFSUV A6 FAVUsES +104 187
#note And a hold call.  I had other places, but next best was 11D for just 81.
>Mike_Baker: ADEHLOT 8G T.OLHEAD +70 297
#note Now it's my turn to hold.  Then I realize...
>Verbie: APRSUVW O4 WARPS +81 268
#note ... that I can give the headache right back to him!  (However, I should trade points for leave:  this is -3 to VARUS O4 75.)  He's not willing to try to turn this into a jaw-breaker play.  Good for him, he'd get bitten.
>Mike_Baker: DIMNOR L3 MINOR.D +20 317
#note Not knowing Mike's other tile, I don't know if this is an error or not.  Still too many open lanes for this to matter. (In the absence of seventh tile info, Q likes MO C12.)
>Verbie: BBITUUV K2 BUBU +28 296
#note umm... yeah.  Nothing within nine points.
>Mike_Baker: OORZ 14H ORZO +35 352
>Verbie: EEITTVW 10F WE. +31 327
#note Missing EVITE 15K 38. (-8.5)
>Mike_Baker: AEY 15J AYE +23 375
>Verbie: EIJKTTV 13K JIVE +41 368
#note I'm still right on his tail... (top) I need (R or S) (a way to get a mid counter above it) (Mike to be short of power).  THRIP would be just dandy.
>Mike_Baker: EIN N8 .INE +7 382
>Verbie: CIKRTTT O12 CRIT +42 410
#note I lie a bit:  I had mistracked and thought the R's were all played.  Worse, I saw an N not crossed, which caused me not to see the H still up.
>Mike_Baker: EEHIIPS M1 HIP +30 412
#note holds the S since I'm not going out anytime soon
>Verbie: KTTT L12 K. +12 422
#note Stuck.
>Mike_Baker: EEIS K8 .IES +17 429
>Verbie: TTT N13 .T +8 430
#note Or maybe it was the equivalent TUMP 3J
>Mike_Baker: E F9 ..E +6 435
#note or 1L EH
>Mike_Baker:  (TT) +4 439
