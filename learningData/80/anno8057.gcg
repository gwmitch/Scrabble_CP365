>Dave: AAINORX 8H AXION +26 26
#note I'm more than a little surprised that Quackle's static evaluator favors ANOXIA here.  I'd rather keep AR than R and not slot a vowel.  The leaves aren't quite good enough to make short plays worthwhile.
>Joe: ACDENST K4 TACN.DES +94 94
>Dave: AEORRRS M2 ROARERS +79 105
>Joe: ?ADEIPR 11D PREDIAl. +70 164
#note A mystifying play for multiple reasons.  Row 2 bingos score more than enough extra to offset the poor defense.
>Joe: ?ADEIPR --  -70 94
#note Then there's also the fact that PREDIAL is an adjective in OWL.
>Dave: FIIILRW J10 FIL +29 134
#note For the next several turns, I wished that I could play IWI#.
>Joe: ?ADEIPR 2H RAPIe.ED +82 176
#note This would have made a lot of sense on the previous turn, but after FIL he had better options on row 13.
>Dave: EIIJORW 1F JOE +36 170
#note Count how many turns I have to make a play that keeps multiple I's in this game.  At least I'm still scoring well.

>Dave: HIIORTW 14G WHIT +28 250
#note Quackle likes continuing to hoard the I's with WO 1N, but I was sick of them already!
>Joe: FO 15H OF +40 319
#note Joe underscored this by one.
>Dave: DEEHIOR 1N HE +29 279
#note I definitely prefer this to HO with all those E's remaining.  I underscored it and the next play by one point each.
>Joe: CNNOT H7 C.NNOT +9 328
#note Assuming he had no better scoring options, this makes a lot of sense, both to turn over tiles and to make bingos more difficult.  What would you do now if you were in my shoes?
>Dave: DEIILOR N1 ..ILED +27 306
>Joe: AEG 5C GAE +16 344
#note Continuing to block up the board.  My comeback chances are looking pretty slim at the moment.
>Dave: IILORVY 6E IVY +20 326
>Joe: AADNP 13C PANDA +24 368
#note Joe and I discussed this play after the game.  Although it did not work out for him, it strikes me as exactly the right thing to do.  For one thing, his lead isn't that big so he needs to keep scoring.  For another, my best spot to bingo is from 12A.  For another, although I might hit ZA 12D, he would then have tempo on a tight board.  Finally, the S, Z, and blank are still out there, and he wants to try to beat me in the race.
>Dave: EILNORT D7 ORIENT.L +68 394
#note Terrible luck for Joe.  My previously unplayable bingo goes down, and I pick up the blank and Z.
>Joe: BEGOSUV 15A VUGS +37 405
>Dave: ?AEEUZ 8A AZU.E +42 436
>Joe: BEO 11B BO.E +12 417
>Joe:  (E?) +2 419
#note Official score: 434-418.
