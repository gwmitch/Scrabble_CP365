>Jim_Burlant: AAEGPRY 8H GRAPY +30 30
#note Many good choices here.  Sim gives the nod to 8G GRAPEY, with this play trailing by not quite one point.
>Ben_Withers: AEG 9J GAE +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIMOW 10G MIAOW +26 56
#note Q gives this the nod over the 7F placement but I have to wonder - is that really right?  Or is 7F better despite scoring 25 to this play's 26?
>Ben_Withers: ADIOP 11C PODIA +20 36
>Jim_Burlant: EIKQSTU 11K SUQ +42 98
#note I actually took a while on this position.  After seeing the obvious SUQ I gave serious consideration to K8  (PAW)KIEST leaving QU, as I was very tempted by the high probabilty of a Q play coming back that scored at least 50 on the next turn either at 12A or on row 15.  But I thought the better of it and put this down.  This wins the sim at 70%; PAWKIEST sims 8 points down.

>Jim_Burlant: BEFOSUZ 13C FUZES +43 263
#note Hmmm.  While this play sims with second  highest valuation behind 3G ZEBU (really?), the 2-ply sim says G3 FOU, 4C SUBZERO, and 13C ZEBUS win more often.  This wins 95.7% and FOU apparently wins 96.6.  The case for the counterintuitive FOU (which I didn't even consider) is that it doesn't burn all the ammo and it also kills  (or at least seriously inhibits) bingos on rows 2 - 6, and Ben won't be able to put a 7 down if he doesn't have an S.    I saw this and saw 43 points, 5-tiles turned and felt it was good enough.   I probably should have put down ZEBUS 13C, as it would not have created a potential X bomb.
>Ben_Withers: ?DENNOS 5C SONNE.eD +66 178
#note 5E cONTENDS or uNSTONED score 82.
>Jim_Burlant: BBDDLOO 3D LOBB.D +16 279
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Never heard of BEBLOOD and couldn't think of BLOODED.  Just wanted to turn as much of this rack as I could and clear it out, which it does...but definitely I should have thought of 3C BLOODED.
>Ben_Withers: HWY 6B WHY +30 208
>Jim_Burlant: ACDIOOR 4J ODOR +13 292
#note No good options.    The only play that scores decently is 4E AD 25, which I rejected as being way too dangerous.   I saw plays like VICAR 2H or AVOID 2G and didn't see the point in playing for cheap and giving  lots more back on row 1.  Also considered (A)CAROID 1H 11 but didn't like giving back 60+ if he had OX (kinda stupid logic when you consider I had already created one potential X bomb on my FUZES play). With no good plays available I figured I should just turn 4 and try again.  Championship Player said I had the right idea but once again, the wrong execution:  too bad I couldn't think of ODIC. The 2-ply sim actually likes this play a lot.   Sim winner is 2G AVOID with this play trailing by 0.4 points at 1200+ iterations.
>Ben_Withers: IN E13 .IN +12 220
>Jim_Burlant: ACEHIRX 15A CHAI.E +36 328
#note Obviously a row-15 play is the ticket, but which one?  Q prefers 14D INARCH or ENRICH or INCHER.  Why should I give him an easy lane for a 7 with this pool?  I opted for CHAINE as opposed to CHAIN because of (a) all the unseen vowels and (b) wanting to maximize turnover in order to shorten the game.
>Ben_Withers: EINNRST 2H .INTNERS +79 299
#note Even with this play, which is clearly best, Ben is only winning 14%, probably because the blank is still out.
>Jim_Burlant: FIOORTX O2 .OX +18 346
#note I saw no bingos at the time and only see one potential bingo, a MATERiAL airball, on row 1.  And given that pool he'd have really had to thread the needle to get it.  I was more worried that if I didn't block potential plays hitting O1, he could sneak past me in an end game since I figured he had the blank and I didn't, so my main objective was to cash the X and eliminate the threat at O1. Championship player prefers 1D IXORA 13, presumably for turnover to get at the blank, and it doesn't like this play at all.
