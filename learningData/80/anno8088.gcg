>Victor_Chua: ACEIQU 8D CAIQUE +40 40
#note I casually asked Victor if he'd kept the Z with this play, and he told me he might have missed the word if he did have the Z :). Nah, that's impossible, coming from a Millennium Cup winner.
>Toh_Weibin: DDIMOOR D8 .ORMOID +24 24
>Toh_Weibin: ADEILRZ (challenge) +5 29
#note Really did not know what to play here. Though DIM F9 is really not a bad play, CORMOID with the 5 points is marginally better. Anyway, need to open up and draw well.
>Victor_Chua: AH E11 AH +23 63
>Toh_Weibin: ADEILRZ I2 REALIZ.D +81 110
#note Yes, like that. I COULD have played it safer with F4 LAIR(I)ZED or I7 R(E)ALIZED in response to his move, but I figured his fish was very likely to net him a bingo anyway, so I should try to score as much as I can to offset it.
>Victor_Chua: ABEILNR 4E INAR.BLE +72 135
#note Turns out LAIRIZED would have given him a 4 timer.
>Toh_Weibin: EFIORTU K3 F.UORITE +72 182
#note Another choice between this and OUTFIRE - but I took the common-sense route, I think.
>Victor_Chua: JO 3G JO. +37 172
>Toh_Weibin: INOSTWY 11H YOWS +44 226
#note TOWSY is probably the play here, but I'm really not sure of my words. Anyway the letters STWY bring me bad memories, especially with an E.
>Victor_Chua: ACEF 5C CAFE +30 202
>Toh_Weibin: AINNTVY F7 V.NY +18 244
#note No idea what's best here, though CP suggests stuff like (R)AVIN 10D and ANTI C11. My move is somewhere round number 7.
>Victor_Chua: ?EINOST 14B SE.ITiON +70 272
#note Excellent choice by Victor not to attempt the S hook. I'd have neutralised the clock in a jiffy (and anyway I'd avoided the S hook earlier with YOWS).
>Toh_Weibin: ADEGINT 15H DATING +38 282
#note Somehow I think a fish here might have done me some good, though this is the best on CP.
>Victor_Chua: EHTV C2 VET.H +26 298
#note Yeah, another nice setup.
>Toh_Weibin: AAEEGUU -AAEGUU +0 282
#note Could have done UVEA, but was worried about giving him 50 pointers from 1D and keeping an average-at-best leave. Should not have worried so much, though - the tiles in the bag look rather conducive to AEGU. Should at least have kept the A when I changed, a mistake I immediately regretted.
>Victor_Chua: EIKT 1A TIKE +45 343
>Toh_Weibin: DEEIMOX 15A MIX +47 329
#note MOXIE 13I would have been very nice, but I missed MNA totally. EX 13E would have been a very strong fish too, but I just didn't see the MNA possibility and dismissed the move. Deserved to lose the game.
>Victor_Chua: AGNW 13G GNAW +23 366
>Toh_Weibin: DEELORS 13C D. +28 357
#note Weak again. Anyway, was getting low on time and hoped to draw a decent consonant from the bag. CP throws out an interesting possibility of O(V)ELS 2B, though I think O(V)EL should be better (it sims second).
>Victor_Chua: ABELNTU B6 ABLUENT +70 436
>Toh_Weibin: EEELORS 7K .E +2 359
#note Er, desperation move.
>Victor_Chua: ?GOPSU N10 GrOUPS +33 469
>Toh_Weibin: EELORRS A6 ROE +25 384
#note SLOE, duh.
>Victor_Chua: AP C9 PA +18 487
>Victor_Chua:  (ELRS) +8 495
#note This was not a game I played well from midgame-onwards.
