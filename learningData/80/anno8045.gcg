#note Just after playing this, I noticed CONATUS for four more points.
>Joe: ??EEGLR H1 LEvERaG. +74 86
#note And this would have scored four more points had I played CONATUS.  So it's a wash.

#note I was worried about a W bingo, since that would have scored too much to overcome unless I drew a bingo.
>Joe: ADEILNN 14C ANNELID +62 361
#note Well, that backfired, but at least I had a decent counter-play.

#note I didn't think Joe could go out, but I mis-tracked his last rack.  For some reason, we both seem to play sloppy games against each other.  If we had a roto team, we should be called The Sloppy Joes.
