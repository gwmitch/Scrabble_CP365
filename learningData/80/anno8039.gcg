>Tunnicliffe: AEEMOST -EO +0 0
#note I hate racks like this. I think I made the right call, though. Quackle prefers 8H OE, but I hate that play against a human.
>Hildebrand: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Tunnicliffe: AEHMSTT 8G MATH +18 18
#note Really tight with HM. I can't see having a very open board after HM, though. And I like setting up my S.
>Hildebrand: BRU J6 BU.R +15 15
>Tunnicliffe: DEEOSTV 10D DEVOTES +83 101
>Hildebrand: EI F10 .IE +6 21
>Tunnicliffe: ADEINOT 6J .O +4 105
#note Saw H8 ATTAINED, but missed ANTIDOTE, which sims best. Yeah, I dunno. I probably would have played ATTAINED if Jeremy didn't just fish. But I really shouldn't have been paranoid about giving him ED to play through, since those letters are already available on the board. But also, I just wanted to be able to reply to his bingo. This is probablyy a mistake, but I bet I would make it again.

>Hildebrand: BHOO E2 BOHO +30 122
>Tunnicliffe: ACDEFPR 12D PR.FACED +84 261
#note Jeremy took forever on his previous turn, so I tracked off my letters and spent a couple minutes imagining weird parallel plays which would block both my spots for the bingo.
>Hildebrand: EWY F1 WYE +36 158
>Tunnicliffe: ?AIITUU -IUU +0 261
#note I didn't like LUAU. Here's why: the best way for me to lose is to spend several turns trying to fix a bingo rack and scoring 10-12. Keeping IIT? risks that. Also, Jeremy needs to open the board this turn, not me. And when he does, I can pounce. This is a 6-point equity error, though, so ouch.
>Hildebrand: EIMNORS M9 MERINOS +83 241
#note He saw WINSOMER after he hit the clock. That would have been a scary play, tightening the score without giving me bingo lines for my blank.
>Tunnicliffe: ?AAIOTY 1F .AY +27 288
#note Pondered 8A ATONY, but this is way better.
>Hildebrand: TUX N8 TUX +57 298
#note WHO'S THE LUCKSACK NOW??!?! ;-)
>Tunnicliffe: ?AAGIOT 15F OTAlGIA. +77 365
#note Oh wait, it's still me. This placement is obvious to me, (but not to Quackle for some reason). As it turns out, he had VIZSLA for a billion, so my block was apt. I noted the lack of H's and Y's, so the dangerous line on row 14 wasn't a big deal. Although the J could hurt, and I imagine that's why Quackle favors O2 OTALGIA by a hair. I guess I got lucky.
>Hildebrand: AZ O7 ZA +39 337
>Tunnicliffe: CEIKNOU 14F NUKE +23 388
#note Time to shut down that J spot, although it's unlikely he has it after ZA.
>Hildebrand: EGIV 13A GIVE +20 357
>Tunnicliffe: CILORSU B10 CUR.O +26 414
#note Or A11 LOGIC accomplishes the same thing.
>Hildebrand: LP 14L P.L +14 371
>Tunnicliffe: GIILNQS C7 QI +44 458
#note Jeremy was at less than 2 minutes, so I played this lightning fast without considering his last play. Stupid. I should have at least spent time considering that it was a setup. Even if I work out that FJELD is the worst case scenario, I think I still have tom play QI. I need to outrun the bingo threat.
>Hildebrand: DEFJL O11 FJELD +78 449
#note Undercounted by NINE!!! Yeesh!!!!!
>Tunnicliffe: GILNNNS I1 SLING +17 475
#note I think this was the only win? Not like it was hard to find. Although in the real game, I had a lot more breathing room thanks to the FJELD undercount.
