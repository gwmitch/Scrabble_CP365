>Winter: AENOUUW -OUUW +0 0
#note Admittedly I fucked up here--I should have dropped the A too, even though Quackle says it's basically the same.

>Alec_Webb: AEGORTT 8D GAROTTE +70 70
#note You have to marvel at the improbability of it. In 8 straight games, my opponents, who aren't even all at my level, have managed to bingo first, and usually within two or three turns.	
>Winter: AAEINSU F6 AU.A +6 6
#note Who knows what might have happened if I had dropped the A last turn. Anyway, I knew Quackle would favour the points, but I was going for hooks.
>Alec_Webb: PX G7 P.X +47 117
>Winter: AEIJNSU 10B JEANS +37 43
#note And I saw JAUNTIES, too, instantly, but I haven't studied any 8s. Anyway, I needed to get some points on the board and hope to get lucky.
>Alec_Webb: ADEO 11B ODEA +28 145
>Winter: HIIRTUU 12E HUI +12 55
#note I've now drawn four Us in four draws.
>Alec_Webb: IVW J6 VI.W +18 163
>Winter: EIOPRTU 13F POUTIER +68 123
#note Stupid.
>Alec_Webb: II 9I I.I +10 173
#note I smell a bingo coming, but meanwhile...
>Winter: NOQRRVW -NOQRVW +0 123
#note Look at this draw. Second exchange.
>Alec_Webb: ?AIMNOR D1 MAjORIN. +76 249
>Winter: CEGLMRU H12 C.LM +45 168
#note If I can just draw well after this...
>Alec_Webb: DKN K8 D.NK +28 277
#note Of course, the block.
>Winter: CEFGRRU L12 F.UG +20 188
#note These fucking tiles. Anyway, F(R)UG is obvious, despite what Quackle says, to open the board.
>Alec_Webb: BELO E2 LOBE +23 300
#note Of course.

>Winter: CEENRRR 14K R.ER +10 198
#note Beyond ridiculous.

>Alec_Webb: AO I13 .AO +9 309
>Winter: CELNRST 2C C..L +8 206
#note Desperation sets in, combined with disbelief.
>Alec_Webb: HOST O12 HOST +38 347
>Winter: ENRSSTV -VSN +0 206
#note ,Not sure how else I'm going to bingo. I figured I've got to throw the S back in, bingo, draw the S to bingo again to the H, and stick him with the Q.
>Alec_Webb: DIY C4 YID +21 368
>Winter: EEFLRST N6 REFLETS +69 275
#note And, he challenges.
>Alec_Webb: BEEN O5 BENE +37 405
>Winter: ?ADNOVZ 1F ADZ +41 316
>Alec_Webb: Y B10 ..Y +13 418
>Winter: ?GNOSVW B10 ...S +14 330
#note I'm going to lose, but I figure I might as well try to fish for an A or I for AVOWING. As I'm debating this, I calculate that there is no way in hell that, after the day I've had, I could draw the Q.
>Alec_Webb: AEEIINT 6J .IE +6 424
>Winter: ?GNOQVW K5 Q. +22 352
#note Of course, today was the day that probability went out the window.
