>Amalan_Iyengar: EKLNORU C11 LEK +30 177
#note OKE is bad. LEKU and KLU(G)E are best. I was looking throuh the G, but I didn't know KLUGE. LEK is next. I know lek. OKE is just bad. Equity lost this turn: 13.1. Total equity loss: 17.5

#note More board vision problems. MUNGO is 4th, after GUNROOM, RUMOUR, and UNMOOR. I didn't know GUNROOM or UNMOOR, but I did know RUMOUR. ON is definitely 4 points better than ORU. Equity lost this turn: 3.2- total equity loss: 20.7

>Amalan_Iyengar: CDFHORU 4K .UOD +28 229
#note hm. I wasn't really expecting (Q)UOD to sim so high, but its apparently the best play. I think that it's because nothing else scores as much, and CH is very good. I also just didn't see any good plays that didn't use both vowels. Equity lost this turn: 0. Total loss-20.2

>Amalan_Iyengar: AIRSSVW E11 WAS +34 294
#note I was debating WAS and VAS here, and I decided to go with WAS because I have the S, and there is 1 S in 38 unseen tiles, so chances are I'll bingo with that. Score is pretty close, and there are no other lanes.  No Bs or Cs left, or F, so I think there's a pretty good chance that I bingo on this soon. Total equity loss-20.2

#note I don't see any good plays on either triple again, and I don't want quackle hitting big on the 1 line triple, so I think i'll take the lower score for better defense. Apparently, that's just a terrible idea. 1000 sims manyply has me losing 14 equity. Total equity loss: 34.1. Not really sure why it's so high, as you wouldn't expect the equity loss to be so much more than the point difference.

>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEINRY 3M Y. +20 464
#note So I'm pretty sure Quackle can't bingo at this point, so I have to score and make sure Quackle doesn't score. No triple lines left, and the biggest scoring spot is M4, so I'll go ahead and take that. Quackle wants me to fish here, which I think is kind of ridiculous, playing AY for 5 points 5C. Looking at average scores, apparently i score an average of 54 points there, and i have a bingo chance of 52%. I'm not really seeing how. I lost 11 equity on this play. I don't get it. Total equity loss: 45.1
