#note I considered being cute with PILAR, since it could tempt the S-hook, but decided to go with what I thought was the best play. But actually, the sim favours PILI.

#note It was probably worth it to burn the S here, but I was hoping to use my S to kill the S-hooks on ENS and LOUNGERS.

#note An equity black hole, but I didn't see many ways that this could lose. 13L GECK probably wins due to just outracing any bingo. But still, might as well make it hard for him to hit two bingos. Also kills and X spot.

#note I think I botched this? At least the sim is telling me I only win 85%. I figured even if he has XYLEM, I am scoring a bunch up top to pull ahead. Do I really lose 15% here? I mean, I get that 1F GOBY is better. Not sure how I missed that
