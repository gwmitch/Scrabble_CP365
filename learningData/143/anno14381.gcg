#note An interesting choice between this and OPAH C8, which I didn't see. This has the advantage of scoring more points, while OPAH keeps a better leave and doesn't open a great new line for Yuki. ADELR probably isn't as good after OPAH as it usually is though. Also, Yuki doesn't bingo much more after PHAsE than after OPAH next turn, but PHAsE is much more conducive to repeated efforts to bingo. She probably has bingo tiles given her last couple plays too, and I would guess that her range is ahead of mine. Should I play OPAH to keep things tight, or PHAsE to score and go for the blank? Tough decision.
