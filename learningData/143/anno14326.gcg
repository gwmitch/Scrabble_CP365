#note THIONIC is pretty good, and THIO sims better too.
>Evans: OPPR I2 PROP +19 93
>Rafi: ?CDHIOO H1 HOOD +42 130
#note I actually saw the bingo, but HOOD is a better play. Unfortunate that I wasn't able to play such a cool word.

>Rafi: ?ACGIIL F7 dIAL.GIC +68 198
#note Seems like there should be more, but this is the only bingo.

>Rafi: ADEEELL 13H .ALLED +22 241
#note This was a little bizarre on my part, not noticing the far superior WELLED. DELE/ES is also a good option.
>Evans: ?AMNORT C9 fORMANT +89 278
#note Very nice overlap by Evans, and a gutsy play as well. I held on REVOLUTES* for a while, but couldn't remember whether it took the S or not. This would have been a big turning point as I could have blocked the bingo lane - I should have realized how big of a swing my decision was before releasing the hold.
>Rafi: DEEEIKQ 15A KI.ED +33 274
#note With 3 U's unseen, KITED is better than QI.

>Evans: EFGOR O2 FORGE +20 350
>Rafi: EIOQRUU 2N E. +10 312
#note Didn't notice QUID, which gives me a fighting chance - the E hook is very difficult to block without having the only other E, and according to Zyzzyva I can also draw TOREUTIC or TUTOYERS down below. My play gives me a 1/12 shot at TURQUOIS, although it might be better to distract with ED or NE to make it look like I'm setting something up.
>Evans: ST O2 .....TS +36 386
>Rafi: IIOQRUU 7C QUO. +22 334
#note Thought this was better than QUID because of the E hook. Blahhh.
