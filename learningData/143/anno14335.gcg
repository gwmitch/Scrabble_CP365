#note I thought also about WEFT I11 and FoRWENT/TELESCOPER. WEFT is a pretty volatile option, as the ideal result is an S draw or a draw that makes use of the blank as an S. I think the presence of the big Z spot strengthens WEFT, as a play there opens up three lanes with which to use my excellent NR? leave. Also, if Peter can't use row 8, I have a decent chance of drawing a play like ZONER there, which would put me in great shape. I think I like FoREWENT, as it puts me up a bit on a board that is strong for scoring and not for bingoing. I'm not really sure though, as using the available scoring spots tends to open more volatile scoring/bingo spots. FoREWENT is less volatile than WEFT, and I'd say their equity is pretty similar (WEFT's is probably better), though FoREWENT is more volatile than it looks. A tough decision.
