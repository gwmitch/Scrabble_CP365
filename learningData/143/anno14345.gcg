>Amalan_Iyengar: AAILRRU -  +0 0
#note wtf? KAURI sims best. I challenged. I am so smart.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: BHO 7E HOB +18 100
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAILRRU 9C AURAL +13 13
#note Haha. wow. what a terrible play. I was thinking URARI and AI before she played HOB. LAURA 8a is best. This play is just crap.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: ?AGIOSS L5 SOA.InGS +74 174
#note dangit. SOAKINGS* I see LASSOING, but I figure SOAKINGS could easily be good.
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEIRRTW 6C DREW +34 47
#note Again, this play is just crap. TAWDRIER is the best play obviously, and then WEIRD 10F. Again, I was looking for stuff there the previous turn, but it didn't show up on my radar. I'm just playing so bad this game.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: OZ 6J ZO. +32 206
>Amalan_Iyengar: AIRTTUX 10F XI +56 103
#note well this is obviously the best. The best real word is TAX, which was my first choice. I wasn't sure about BALI, and I knew BAALI. I am still playing so badly.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: AFMO 8A FOAM +45 251
>Amalan_Iyengar: AGRTTTU -GUTT +0 103
#note Wow. I made the right play!
>Teresa_Schaeffer: INQU M3 QUIN +41 292
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEGPRTT 5D APT +34 137
#note APT is best. (QUIN)T(E)T is sexy.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: IVY 4B IVY +30 322
>Amalan_Iyengar: EGLRTTU A1 GLUT +29 166
#note GLUT is best among the plays I know. GUTTLERS is the only bingo, and then GUTTLE a1.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: CCEIOTU -CCEIOT +0 322
>Amalan_Iyengar: ADEEIRT 12F READIE.T +60 226
#note Hmm. Quackle thinks READIEST is best. I missed ITERATED, and I'm not quite sure why quackle likes READIEST best. ITERATED seems to open up the board more, since I'll still be down by a bingo after.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: CNOT H11 C.NTO +21 343
#note Wasn't sure if it was good, but I figured it opened the board a lot.
>Amalan_Iyengar: BFIINNR N2 FIN +25 251
#note I saw IBRIN, but didn't see any good places to play it. Wuackle is all over the board on this one. It's alternating between BIN, FIN, BRIN, and FIBR(O)IN, although it seems to be settling on BIN. I think I agree with it on this one. The B doesn't have great synergy with INR compared to th F
>Teresa_Schaeffer: JY 15G J.Y +13 356
>Amalan_Iyengar: ABEHINR 14H .ABERIN +35 286
#note I was fairly sure I could get away with TABERIN, and I knew she had an S, so I was hoping she would hook it.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: IPRST O4 STIRP +28 384
#note She meant to play STRIP
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ADEHNO 15K HEDON +43 329
#note Missed the two bingoes here- (F)OrEHAND and (L)ONgHEAD, but HEDON sims after FOREHAND. I should have seen FOREHAND, but I wasn't looking fo a bingo in that lane. whoops.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: EM O1 ME +17 401
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AELOOV A8 .OVEOLAs +92 421
#note Best. I thought FOVEOLAR was good, but I didn't want to risk it. FOVEOLAS seems to be simming tenths of a point above FOVEOLAR, not sure why.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: DEEEEGR -  +0 401
#note challenge
>Amalan_Iyengar: EEER 10J ER.E +5 426
#note (G)REE is the best, then RE(DREW). ER(n)E is way down, but I didn't want to open anything in case I missed something. I'm not really sure why it likes GREE here.
>Teresa_Schaeffer: CDEGSUW G1 DUCES +17 418
#note hahahahaha (G)WEDUCS is best here. I was pretty sure APTS*, but I couldn't risk it, because i would probably lose.
>Amalan_Iyengar: E 1G .E +9 435
#note best
>Amalan_Iyengar:  (GW) +12 447
