>Charles_Reinke: ADEEEST 14F DE. +15 64
#note Lots of plays to consider here.  7G EWE keeps a better leave and creates some more hooks.
>Carol_Dustin: AQT K10 QAT +27 54
>Charles_Reinke: AEEIOST L9 TIES +29 93
#note Quackle thinks I gave up too quickly.  I never know when to keep fishing and when to just take the points. L12 TOEA balances fishing and scoring, whereas the leave after this play is horrible.
>Carol_Dustin: EHNO J6 HONE +20 74
>Charles_Reinke: AEENORT K4 ATONE +19 112
#note I still have a fishable rack even after the horrible leave from last turn, but with no S for SWOP, any fish now needs to open up a new line.  I strongly considered K5 OE, which sets up my T and R.  This play doesn't really open up any new lines, and it gives up high-scoring plays at L1.
>Carol_Dustin: ELMY L1 YLEM +34 108
>Charles_Reinke: DEGLRTZ J2 ZED +39 151
#note 1H LEDGY is an option, but I didn't see how I was going to cash in the Z after that, so I elected to take the points now.

>Charles_Reinke: BEGLLRU 3C BUGL.R +16 198
#note 15A BURGLE.  I was too attached to my E, since there are so few of them left.

>Charles_Reinke: AAEILOU 2F A.O +14 241
#note Only down by 10 here, but the AIO draw makes it a lot harder to take and maintain a lead.  I should exchange to go for the S's and remaining blank.

>Charles_Reinke: AELNRRW 6D WR.. +7 270
#note Apparently this gives me better Win% than anything else, but with this play I am basically praying for a bingo or a high-scoring 1A play.
>Carol_Dustin: EJ F12 J..E +12 297
>Charles_Reinke: ADEGLNR 1A RANGED +34 304
#note The leave after F1 DAL gives me bingos with an I, S, Y or blank.  It also prevents her from scoring big on row 1, and leaves me with RANGED next turn if I don't draw the bingo.  With this play, I just hope she can't bingo and I can go out. 
>Carol_Dustin: ?IORSVY A1 .eVISORY +92 389
#note Nice find by Carol.  This and the absolutely ridiculous 15A ISOPRENE are her only winning plays, presuming I find C10 LIRAS.
