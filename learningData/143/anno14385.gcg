>Yuki_Loritz: EFKR 8E KERF +22 22
>Jerry_Lerman: EEIRRWZ E5 ZER. +34 34
#note Short sim shows ZE(E) at F6 for 32 as about 5 points better, and 7F WEIR for 22 as slightly better
>Yuki_Loritz: DEM F6 ME.D +25 47
>Jerry_Lerman: EGIRTWW -WWG +0 34
#note Much betteris G7 GREW for 21 points - about 12 better than trading here.  WRIT isn't a horrible leave.  Don't know why I passed it up...perhaps didn't see it.

>Yuki_Loritz: EEF G7 F.EE +26 73
>Jerry_Lerman: EGIILRT 11E GIRL +18 52
#note Better here are REGILT H10 for 29 (which I noted on my score sheet with a ? -- I guess I wasn't sure it was good) and 7E (REF)IT for 14 - just a fraction of a point better.
>Yuki_Loritz: AADMN 12H ADMAN +21 94
>Jerry_Lerman: EEGIPTT 11K PET +20 72
#note 11K PETTI in same spot - for 24 - sims about two points better.  PEG there sims about one pt better  TEG is about the same as PET.

>Yuki_Loritz: COY 13H COY +25 119
>Jerry_Lerman: AEGIITU -AGIIU +0 72
#note Simulation advises exchanging  - and keeping none or keeping ET or AET are swapping in and out as 'best' choices.   After 1000 iterations, my choice - keeping ET - seems stable at top - about 1 point better than alternatives.
>Yuki_Loritz: OT 12D TO +7 126
>Jerry_Lerman: EHJPSTV 14F JEST +37 109
#note Finally!  I got one right!  Sims 1.5 better than VEST in same spot

>Yuki_Loritz: ASTV I6 VAST +21 147
>Jerry_Lerman: AEHPRVY 5G PEAVY +34 143
#note HEAVY sims about 1.5 points better, and scores 2 points more

>Yuki_Loritz: ABO 13C BOA +16 163
>Jerry_Lerman: ?AHLORR H1 HAOL. +27 170
#note Sims best, whith RHO at 15D for 16 
3 points behind
>Yuki_Loritz: ADW 14B DAW +24 187
>Jerry_Lerman: ?LORRTU 15A TOR +17 187
#note 15A ROT is preferred by about 1.5 - I guess because it doesn't create a TORN/TOWN one tile dump play.  3G L(O)UR for only 6 is also slightly preferred, as is (H)URL for 7. 
>Yuki_Loritz: AW G3 WA. +23 210
>Jerry_Lerman: ?GILORU 15E GOR +15 202
#note My choice falls near the bottom of the sim - about 4-5 points behing 4K OUR for 11, J3 GU(V) for 7
>Yuki_Loritz: ISX 10L SIX +31 241
>Jerry_Lerman: ?AEILUU -UU +0 202
#note Best is trading away UUI, since there are still 6 Is unseen.  It sims 3.6 points better, with 43% winning chance versus 41% after my trade of UU
>Yuki_Loritz: ?EGHIST 15I EIGHThS +97 338
#note Quackle understandably likes 1H (H)EIGHThS for 104 - but not everyone knows that HEIGHTHS is a word.  No problem:  EIGHTHS yileds a 99.66% winning probability.  (I didn't need a simulator to tell me I was lost after this play;  I recognized it immediately over the board!  :-)  )

>Jerry_Lerman: ?AEIILN M13 AI. +6 208
#note Missed the obvious bingo (H)AIRLINE for 83, unless I tracked my tiles incorrectly.  That's possible, sinc ethere was some confusion here on my scoresheet, due to my running short of time.
>Yuki_Loritz: EN I1 EN +9 347
>Jerry_Lerman: ?EIILNU J1 NIL +16 224
#note NIL simulates best or nearly best in terms of winning percentage - not quite 3.5% chance.  I'm hoping to draw HENEQUIN, HENIQUEN, or HENEQUEN for 87.  Of course, that still won't make up the point deficit I'm facing, but it'll be worth some style points. :-)

>Yuki_Loritz: DNU O12 DUN. +7 354
>Jerry_Lerman: ?EILRUU N8 LU. +10 234
#note 3J (L)ULU for 8 supposedly offers 7% winning chances.  My LUX only 1.3%
>Yuki_Loritz: BEINNOU O8 IN +14 368
>Jerry_Lerman: ?BEIORU 9M B.. +16 250
>Yuki_Loritz: CEINOQU O6 QU.. +13 381
>Jerry_Lerman: ?EINORU O4 RE.... +16 266
#note Just about out of time here (couldn't track any more racks), I miss the opportunity to use the blank as the Q and play HENIQUEN/HENEQUIN) for 30.
