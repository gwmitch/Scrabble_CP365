#note As always, Nigel provided me with his racks. XU looks like the better option here. 
>whatnoloan: EEEINRR 4H .EINER +18 42
#note I had some trouble deciding between VEINER and ERNE. It seemed to me that ERNE wouldn't give back much less than OXLIP already does, and that VEINER would have slightly better points + leave, but Quackle suggests that I'm wrong, likely because two tile fishes above OX score better than two tile fishes above ERNE, and because EIR is better than I thought. This probably also opens the board more than ERNE, which isn't something I really want against Nigel.

#note Wasn't sure about UNGULATES but I'm glad I tried it.

#note MIRTH fits nicely at L8.

#note I overdrew and Nigel flipped over AJN. He elected to put back the A.

>whatnoloan: ?CDEFIT 8A FETICiD. +92 285
#note I thought about this play for awhile, considering DEFiCITS O1, DEFICITs 13G, CiTIFIED 13G, INFECT H10, and this play.  I couldn't decide which made for a less volatile board, except for CiTIFIED, which didn't score enough for my liking. In the end I played this because it was most likely to draw a challenge.

#note Just QU(A) looks good here.

>Nigel: ?AEIIOR 2E OI +10 259
#note ILIAL 7G is a cool option here, and seems best.
>whatnoloan: AAEMTWZ 1F AMAZE +51 394
#note I actually didn't notice the Z(IN) hook at all, and ZETA is another good option here. Apparently I score more next turn after AMAZE, so I'd still pick that.
>Nigel: ?AEEIRT 14G REA.IEsT +85 344
>whatnoloan: AORTVWW H13 T.W +18 412
#note This was a tough play. I considered TEW and REAVOW, which both have merits. This blocks off the most dangerous scoring lane, while REAVOW turns over more tiles and blocks all lanes besides row 15, but seemed to leave me more vulnerable to scoring plays. In reality, this is incorrect, as even HOPED 15D leaves me very likely to win this game. However, TEW allows fewer bingos than REAVOW does, so it seems that TEW has to be correct, especially since row 15 bingos are on average more detrimental to my winning chances than column A, B, and C bingos.
