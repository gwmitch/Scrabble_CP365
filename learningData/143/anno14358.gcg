>Mary_Atwood: AEMTY 8H MATEY +28 28
#note MN vs WI 2013, round 2.
>Charles_Reinke: ?EHIOOP 9H OHO +25 25
#note Missed WHOOPIE and ISOPHOTE, the latter of which I saw but chickened out on.  
>Mary_Atwood: AJK K5 JAK. +30 58
>Charles_Reinke: ?DEIILP 10H LIPIDEs +87 112
>Mary_Atwood: LOT L4 LOT +17 75
>Charles_Reinke: CGGIRST 3L CIG +18 130
#note GIG or GRIG at M3.  I think I was fixated on the LOT hook.
>Mary_Atwood: ELTW 11E WELT +20 95
>Charles_Reinke: BGRRSTU F7 BURG.R +13 143
#note Either this or N6 BURGS.  This adds some bingo lines to the board that BURGS does not.
>Mary_Atwood: RUU N3 .URU +7 102
>Charles_Reinke: CEOSSTT O1 COST +31 174
>Mary_Atwood: AENV O6 NAVE +23 125
>Charles_Reinke: EEGIOST 12A GOITE. +23 197
#note Lots of I's and N's left, so perhaps not a good idea to open the board for easy-to-find -ING bingos on the triple line. Over the board I briefly considered L10 DOGIE, which sets up my S and keeps EST.  
>Mary_Atwood: FX C11 F.X +26 151
>Charles_Reinke: DEHLMQS M9 H.LMED +32 229
#note I've never played SHEQEL, but even if I had seen it, I wouldn't have thought MATEY took an S.  I could also dump the Q for 32, although the spot will probably stay open for next turn, and this gives me a shot at QAIDS with lots of A's and I's in the bag.
>Mary_Atwood: ERW A12 .REW +24 175
>Charles_Reinke: ?AENQSY 6J Q.. +32 261
#note I could also go for bingo-like points here with plays at 14J.
>Mary_Atwood: UV 12K VU. +16 191
>Charles_Reinke: ?AENOSY G1 NOSEgAY +75 336
#note Didn't see SOYBEAN or CYANOSED, which are safer.  Pretty much the only way I can lose is if Mary triple-triples.  A lot of non-bingo plays are better for that reason.

>Mary_Atwood: IZ B1 ZI. +24 230
>Charles_Reinke: AADENRR 5B ARRAN.ED +66 468
#note I guess NOSEGAY worked out.
