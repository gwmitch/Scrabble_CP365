#note MN vs WI 2013, round 11.  I saw APOGEIC, got it confused with APOGEAN, and ended up not playing it.  What to do after that is hard to determine since nothing hits either of the DLS's.  AGIO leaving CEP looks best since it gives me three vowels to play through.

#note KNUBBIER!  Why isn't KNUB a word?  Also saw BUMKIN but thought it needed the P.  Not playing well this game.

#note Now that I'm in possession of an S, it makes sense to set it up on column E.

#note If I'm going to play through this, I should be blocking bingo lanes, not creating new ones.  Exchanging everything but MT looks good with the amount of A's and E's left.

#note I was all set to play VELUMS*.  Luckily it got blocked before I could try it.  Setting up my S seems correct.
>Joe_Gaspard: AGOR J10 .ARGO +26 332
>Charles_Reinke: AAELSUV 15F AVULSE +36 352
#note I saw the possibility of O1 JATO/JOTA, but didn't see how blocking it with VAT could win, since he will probably score too much with the J anyway (K5 HAJI, 3F JOLE).  But with the J in the bag, either VAT or AVULSE will win.
