#note You could maybe infer he was vowel-lite after DREK and then want to avoid hanging that A out there. But I dunno. This sims about even with 7E BIO, which might be a little better with said inference.

#note I was way too focused on unloading the V here. But with the available lanes, it's actually a solid bingo tile. Silly to overlook the strength of the EIRV leave on this board. 12B GIFT sims best.
>Adam_Logan: EEEORSY J5 EYESORE +80 212
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABFINOU K11 FUB +26 102
#note Felt dumb afterwards for not playing FOU, but they actually sim equally. Surprising.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEINNO L1 EONIAN +33 135
#note Two high-scoring placements for this word. My logic for this one is that if I play at H10, it's really easy for Adam to play parallel to that word, or just through it, to completely kill the bottom half of the board. Right now, that part of the board is still conducive to S-hooks, and I want to keep it that way. H10 EONIAN leads to a dead board too quickly.

#note I spent a ton of time on those first four turns, and was paying for it now, with only 3 minutes left. Surprisingly, this play is about as good as it gets.
