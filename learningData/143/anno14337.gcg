#note I didn't notice RAFTERED 12H, which also scores 78 and makes the game harder for Leah to play.

#note This was a tough decision and there are many plays to consider. Exchanging, placements of IO, IO(D)IC in both spots, and CES(T)OI and COSIE are all options here. I liked my play because it scored well enough, and kept a decent leave with an S, which is conducive to the board. It also didn't give back as much to Leah as plays like OI 13J. CEIOS is still a bit of a lame leave though. Quackle likes my choice, but what do you think? How does my opponent change the decision?
