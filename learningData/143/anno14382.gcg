>Nigel: ACEJORX B4 CAJO.ER +34 104
#note Nigel provides his racks again for this game. I like RAJ here, as CAJOLER looks to lead to a much more wide-open board than RAJ does, and 37 points with CEOX is still great.

>whatnoloan: ?KNOOUZ A10 OUZO +26 48
#note I didn't see OUZO 7G which looks strong here. I chose this over OUZO D11 because of the Z scoring spot, but perhaps I just shouldn't be too afraid of that.
>Nigel: BEEEORR 7F BEER +17 159
#note BRE(V)E blocks my best options for playing sevens.
>whatnoloan: ?DKNPTU E2 PUK.D +12 60
#note I didn't like the cheap scores PUNK and DUNK gave away. PUNKEST does the same thing they do. An interesting option here is G6 DESK, keeping row 4 open but also retaining a poor leave. Quackle always seems to tell me that I overestimate the potency of scoring spots, saying for example that Nigel's average score after PUNKEST is only one more point than after PUKED.

#note AIN B12 works.
>whatnoloan: AGINNOS 9B ..ON +16 155
>Nigel: AEIMNRU 2A UNRI.E +20 214
#note U(P) is pretty cool here, keeping a great bingo leave and setting up a great scoring spot if Nigel can't draw a bingo.

#note Why not just MOA or MO here?

>whatnoloan: AEESTTY 4E .YTE +12 285
#note I can't see myself winning this game without a bingo. With that in mind, YET and TYE on column J mostly kiss my winning chances goodbye. I need a new lane.
>Nigel: ADEQRSW A1 Q.A +36 347
>whatnoloan: AAEHSTU 1A .UA +16 301
#note Tough decision here between J9 HAUT and QUA. What I didn't like about HAUT is that it blocked the P, making it easier for him to block everything I could do, but thinking about that more, the P isn't useful to bingo through either. According to Quackle, HAUT bingos about as much as QUA, so I should definitely take HAUT for points, as there isn't really an advantage to QUA otherwise. I had thought QUA bingoed quite a bit more than QUA.
>Nigel: DELRSTW 9K .WL +7 354
#note Lots of available plays here, from AWL, WIT and the like to blocking plays like DWELT 3H. I think WIT is a better choice than AWL, because it makes it harder for me to block all of Nigel's bingos with my own bingo. DWELT, on the other hand, doesn't block enough bingos to be good.
>whatnoloan: ADEHSTT N4 DEATHS +19 320
#note There don't appear to be any winning plays, while this minimizes Nigel's bingo chances. 
>Nigel: BDEIRST O1 BIDERS +48 402
#note I added to BIDERS's score because I went over on time.
