#note I'm guessing she had the X even though SQUEG isn't a good play anyway.

#note I thought also about NOG 5I, but missed NAG 9F and NAGS I5. When comparing this to NOG, I saw the (YEN)S hook as a pro, while realizing that the spot NOG opened was both higher scoring and less likely than the row 5 scoring spot. I chose this because of the row 10 hook that this gives me, which seems like a good advantage. Not sure that's right though. NAGS is an interesting choice. I like it because it makes her play harder most of the time. I don't like so much that it's a pretty closed choice, but that's not the worst thing when you consider that the board can easily be opened later if I want it to be. I'm not so sure about this play, though taking the points with NAGS looks a bit solider than anything else at the moment.

>whatnoloan: DEINRST N3 TINDERS +69 137
#note I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to infer bingo tiles after WAN. The next two plays had me second guessing myself, but I think I was correct and it was just somewhat bad luck. I chose this because it looked more conducive to my 7 tile draw than to her 4 bingo tiles plus 3 other tiles. The other TINDERS made a board which I would say is less scoring and maybe more bingo friendly, though this is still pretty bingo friendly.

#note FINO 2A doesn't seem defensible. IF and WIFE and SOFTIE are the other options. I don't see the appeal of the former two which Quackle has a huge boner for. Opponent scores less after them than after this but...that doesn't do it for me. Any input? I like not keeping a shitty leave and going for the blanks which are EXTREMELY important here.

>whatnoloan: ABCEHSU 15F BA.UCHES +66 296
#note So it seemed like I was dead without trying something here. I didn't want to try something for too much like BABUCHES or KABUCHES because they just seemed too likely to be challenged. What do you think, should I go for the higher-scoring phony? Should I phony at all? (Spread does matter at this point in the tournament, otherwise I don't think not phonying is defensible.)

#note What about OHIA 14K? The strategy with OHIA is to draw J?, and that's also the strategy for OUTHIT (if she gets the J I'm usually screwed over by JEU, and if she gets the blank I'm usually screwed over too) but OHIA gives me a higher scoring option for J?, potentially weathering (ZA)P plays, and isn't that easy to block (especially if you aren't attentive). I like OHIA here.

#note This game was really frustrating to play but it was almost as frustrating to Quackle because I found that during the game I missed a lot of opportunities for good plays because I was annoyed that a much weaker player was getting consistent easy and cheap plays. Well, that happens sometimes but you should be able to deal with that rather than just steaming and missing AWAITED, INTIS, and OHIA and playing turns too quickly.
