#note I only saw UNOIlED, NEUrOID and DOUrINE. This was the most defensive of those plays, so I chose it. However, qUOINED does the same thing better.

#note I'm really happy about this play. I was about to play HIRED 9F, but noticed the flaw in that plan. Then I thought about HEIR, but realized I could just play the E, and bingo with a lot of stuff. I'm not saying this is an especially great play in general, but it is specifically for me, because I miss a lot of good midgame fishing opportunities.

#note I found this play difficult but missed a simple option -- UP 10A, which must be best.

>whatnoloan: BGOOSST A13 BOG +24 301
#note I didn't like plays on row 6, giving easier access to the top right quadrant, and also considered B(U)GS. BUGS still kept things pretty open though, and kept a substantially worse leave, so I just took BOG.

#note STILLERS is phony. Can you find the best valid play here?
>Mark_Milan: AJT A6 TAJ +60 283
>whatnoloan: AAABERS B2 ABA +20 409
#note I also considered BA(L)SA here, and AA 11N might be reasonable as well. I'm probably just supposed to take the points, as this board doesn't have any great S hooks and also isn't prone to case S setups. AERS doesn't seem too bingo-prone here (well, nothing does).
