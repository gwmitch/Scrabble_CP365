#note Dammit, if I make the right play, I deny him the bingo.
>Chris_Lipe: CEFIORS L8 CO.IFERS +84 117
#note Still annoying that this guy always gets the bingoes.

>Winter: EFGMNST 8L ..EF +36 160
#note Another in a string of Collins words, starting with EUTAXITE and TAENIATE from last night's game, that could have won me this game. I hate it when I play a string of games that are just out of reach because they just happen to require word knowledge that is just beyond me.

>Winter: AAEOOPR G3 PRAO +16 354
#note I can practically smell the blank and ess on his rack. Assuming that, blocking both lines is a must. Obviously Quackly won't do it, but Quack can't read his body language, and Quack doesn't know that if he can't bingo, he has trouble.

>Chris_Lipe: ALNT C2 LANT +16 354
>Winter: AADEORR D2 OD.A +13 367
#note He has the ess, obvi. I saw ALANT, but I litereally just started on the hook 5s two days ago, and am far from learning them. Barring that, I have to block. Quack would never block, but it's a must-do play. Penalizes me 22 pts, on top of 17 for the previous play.
>Chris_Lipe: DEO H1 DOE +16 370
>Winter: AEIRRRR I2 RARER +14 381
#note Based on the tile pool, a bingo is not a slam dunk, but I still have to block, just in case. Start with AIRER, but unsure of PER, and then decide keeping a vowel is better for going out.
>Chris_Lipe: ?EEHOST 14B TOSH. +22 392
>Winter: EINR 11A REIN +9 390
#note And he gives me the winning play, but rather than look for the safe REIN, I immediately convince myself that RENI* was good, confusing it with RENY and FENI. Only seen the 4-letter Rs two or three times, and then again while looking at hooks, but RINE has not stuck yet, and I cost myself what would have been a sweet win, being double-blanked as I was.
