>Jeff_Fiszbein: NRTUY 8H RUNTY +24 24
#note We shook hands before our 14th tournament game and I said "Let's have fun," as is my usual. "We always do," he said. Indeed.
>Jason: CDEINOP I8 .NCOPIED +65 65
#note The highest score+leave is 26.7, so it's good I got creative here with this phony. Probably should've looked harder for double-doubles through the T, but I just went with the adage "if it's giving you a headache, make it give your opponent a headache." And, when I asked a few friends "You like UNCOPIED*?" after the game, Viebranz, Knappster and Pianowski all liked it. Jeff held, and was genuinely surprised when he looked it up after the game. Stunningly (to me, anyway), there's only one eight in the rack. You see it?
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AARVW 15D VAWAR. +51 75
#note After the game, Jeff asked if this took an S. I thought it did, he didn't think so. It does. (It also makes it hard to challenge UNCOPIED* if he's got this coming back.)
>Jason: ABEEEPW L4 WEEP. +26 91
#note In honor of my next opponent. Did not know BEWEE(P).
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EFGLR 11H G.LFER +20 95
>Jason: AABEGIS K4 ABA +25 116
#note If I'd been caught up on Jesse D.'s annotated games, I would've known WEEPY takes the S front hook and maybe made a different play. Did not see the star play, the four-overlap (C)EIBA. AI(R)BAG's nice, too.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IMV J2 VIM +24 119
>Jason: EGIKSSY J6 KI. +34 150
#note SKY at 3L is better. Stupid SWEEPY.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: Q 3I Q. +21 140
>Jason: DEGMSSY M9 GE.MY +26 176
#note "I thought you had the vowels," Jeff said. Nope, all in the bag. Did not know (E)MYDES at 14I for 36, Q's favorite.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: OX N9 OX +53 193
#note "Be gentle," Jeff said after he hit his clock. "Sadly, I won't be," I answered.
>Jason: ?DEINSS O3 SNIDESt +77 253
#note For whatever reason, could not trust myself on the only 79-pointer: mISSEND. I put down DISSENt and Jeff said "I register my dissent to that play." For whatever reason, I decided to switch to the anagram and I said "You can register your snidest dissent." As he tracked, Jeff said "two S's and a blank?" Yup, I is luckbox.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: JO N2 JO +20 213
>Jason: AAFIOOT N5 OAF +20 273
#note Here are those vowels I was hearing so much about. "20's not a bad score on this board," Jeff said after I hit my clock. "Yeah, this is like our game at Arden," I said. "And who won that?" he asked. Yeah, guess I shouldn't complain. :)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: III -III +0 213
>Jason: ADEGIOT 7B GODETIA +63 336
#note Pick a dream draw into IOTA and the rout is on. "If I'd known I was gonna draw like this, I'd rather have played Lloyd Mills!" I said.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEHNRST E2 HEART.NS +72 285
#note As Jeff started to put this down, I thought "c'mon, give me the open R..." Thanks to Jeff for making the choice of the only one that does.
>Jason: ABEILTT 5B TIT.ABLE +60 396
#note Against somebody else of approx. equal rating, playing a goofy-looking 2K-3K prob bingo, I might've "Hollywooded" a bit, not playing so fast and confidently. But given Jeff's science background, I figured he'd know this as a "word" word as opposed to a Scrabble word. He held, though, and quickly said "That's some bad English." After about 30 seconds he challenged and, trying to let him down easy said, "It's bad English, but it's good in the book." Jeff was still shaking his head as we walked back from the challenge station, saying "It should be TITRATABLE." "What was that we were saying before the game about the dictionary having no rhyme or reason?" I asked. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EL -  +0 285
#note One more note: Knappster always has his "You like (word)?" quizzes to me, so I laid UNCOPIED* and TITRABLE on him (he went with Jeff on each) and told him the story behind each. As he always does when I tell him a word he doesn't know, he incredulously asked "How do you know that word?" I told him it was in the probability range I've been studying. "125 to 150?" he asked. Har de har har, Knappster. :)
>Jason: ACLOSUZ N13 AZO +29 425
#note Jeff pointed out I had four bingos and asked if I'd ever gotten five. I'm pretty sure I haven't, so I spent the rest of the game pishing away spread trying to get it, hence not playing the clearly best ZOA at 14E here, 'cause I didn't want to close the line through the I down. "How'd you know I didn't have an A?" Jeff asked as he turned the board around. "'Cause I played the last one," I said. Jeff looked at his tracking sheet and said "Oh. (pause) A wise guy, eh?" If I didn't put Jeff on my "five favorite opponents to play" list on that one meme, I should've. Love playing Jeff.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EL L10 L.E +24 309
>Jason: CILRSTU G3 CU. +10 435
#note If I'd seen RITU(A)L at 4A, I might've wisely given up on bingoing. I'm still not seeing multiple overlaps as well as I usually do.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEN J11 .END +22 331
>Jason: HILRRST 15L RH. +7 442
#note As I was thinking here, Jeff showed me his EIIOUU and said "Want a vowel?" I could've deduced that the three unseen tiles were ?NO after that, but I didn't want to abuse the privilege. Hoping the blank's in the bag. Again, if I'd seen THI(O)L there, would've done that. Although, RH(O) sims better, as I can really cash in if the blank's in the bag. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EIIOUU F7 .UI +7 338
#note Q likes OUp(H)E, which will be Jeff's next play. So much for him unwittingly giving me a NOSTRIL opening...
>Jason: ILNORST 14E LOT +16 458
#note Two behind NORT(H)S. For style points, play INOS(I)T(O)L; it works out the same. "Why didn't you play TON in the same spot?" Jeff teasingly asked. Um, because I didn't want to give you an out play? :)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EIOU 2B OUp.E +18 356
#note Best.
>Jason: INRS 1F RINS +14 472
#note 7-6, and I have still not dropped below .500 yet. Kind of like Albany in reverse, where I was .500 like four times and always lost the next game to drop below. Still, though, not winning this game by about 150, which I probably should have, would hurt in the long run. I learned a valuable lesson from this game: Scrap and claw for every stinkin' spread point. I never imagined I'd be in a spot where spread mattered, but I was and lost a lot getting hung up on goofy stuff like trying to get a fifth bingo. Never again.
>Jason:  (I) +2 474
