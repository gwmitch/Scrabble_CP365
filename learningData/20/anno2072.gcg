>Michael_Early: AI 8H AI +4 4
#note Does anyone NOT hate when there opponent's open like this? And a question: is it ever correct to play a two-vowel two-letter word to open? I honestly don't know.
>Sam: GIILRRT J8 RIG +11 11
#note RIG is pretty crappo* (huh, COPPRA and COPRA). GRIT 9F is the big sim winner. It makes sense to me in hindsight, especially when you consider that Mike almost certainly did not leave a Z. This sim of course can't take that into account, but it's an additional factor.
>Michael_Early: ??AHNST 11E TArNiSH +87 91
#note ASTHeNiA and ATAgHaNS are the best two, each scoring two more than TArNiSH. Mike must have missed a bingo on his opener, I think--SHAITAN in some form looks possible no matter what his leave was. 
>Sam: EIKLORT 10C TRIKE +38 49
#note Wow, plays like this look unconscionable in retrospect. If I found the right spot, why can't I spot KOI right there? Even LIKE or TIKE would have been an improvement here.
>Michael_Early: CV H7 V.C +8 99
>Sam: DELOPSS K3 PODLESS +76 125
>Sam: DELOPSS --  -76 49
#note Don't remember where I tried this, but this looks like it would be best if PODLESS* was a word. Apparently I enjoy hemorrahging spread in tournaments just for the hell of it. Of the real plays, SOP B10, PLODS 12A, OPS 9D, SLOPED B10, and SOLED B10 jump to the top. I don't particularly love any of these plays, as I should try to keep that S-hook open. However, both of the plays that don't take advantage of STRIKE (PLODS and OPS) give easy scoring opportunities for the opponent. SOP B10 might be best in that case, setting up another S-hook and keeping the premium leave.
>Michael_Early: JOST K5 JOTS +26 125
>Sam: DELOPSS L4 POD +24 73
#note Nothing really wrong with this. And it's defensive because POD doesn't take a front hook, right?
>Michael_Early: AEEORXY -AEEO +0 125
>Sam: AEELRSS M5 EARLESS +73 146
#note Learned it when Heidler playd it on me in Round 2. I'm fine with sacking seven points instead of playing RESEALS/RESALES B8.
>Michael_Early: ALNORXY C10 .ARN +8 133
>Sam: AAILOWZ 12A ZO.I +46 192
>Michael_Early: ANO A12 .ONA +39 172
>Sam: AABELLW H11 .AWAB +33 225
#note Missing BOWEL B11.
>Michael_Early: GQU 14F QU.G +34 206
>Sam: EEGLLMN L9 NEEM +26 251
#note The sim strongly prefers ELM L11 to NEEM. The leave seems to be the only issue here; I don't think ELM is any better than NEEM defensively. Actually, scratch that, ELM blocks QUAGMIRIER. No wonder it's better.
>Michael_Early: FFO 15H .OFF +15 221
>Sam: ADEGILL 13H .ALL +13 264
#note GLADLIER, which I considered at the time, is good! GRILLADE also. I'll know this word by probability soon, though I guess I could have used it here. GLIAL 3I, along with a myriad of other row 3 plays, is best...if POD had a front hook. Which it doesn't. Right?
>Michael_Early: DEEMOT D4 DEMOTE. +22 243
#note Held this phony for a while. I was pretty certain it was no good, but then I doubted myself. I was fine with DEMOTER* because it blocked the only bingo line, and I could block all the bingo lines it set up. Because POD doesn't have a front hook. Right?
>Sam: BDEGIRV C3 VIBE +29 293
#note Glaringly inferior to GIBED C3.
>Michael_Early: HPY B6 HYP +35 278
>Sam: DEGIORX E5 DEX +52 345
#note Wasn't happy leaving column A open, but a play there seemed somewhat unlikely, and DEX was just too many points to pass up.
>Michael_Early: DI 8M .ID +12 290
>Sam: GINORUW O6 WU. +7 352
#note Of course, a block is necessary, regardless of what the sim thinks. I liked keeping the O for a column A play.
>Michael_Early: EIR 15D REI +15 305
>Sam: EGINOOR 8A O. +12 364
#note I really don't know why I didn't lay down the I for OI and six more points. I had a reason at the time, I know. GOOIER A1 is probably best, but I didn't know RHEME back in Orlando. 
>Michael_Early: Y 7D ..Y +13 318
>Sam: EGINORU 4B G.. +5 369
#note This is a good play because he might have a high scorer like CUTLET to the triple with THEME. And there aren't any bingo lanes, because POD doesn't have a front hook. Right. (Even if I recognized APOD, I dunno if there was anything I could have done about it here, except for playing GLIAL way back when I played WALL.
>Michael_Early: AILNTTU 14A .U +4 322
>Sam: EINORTU A5 UT +12 381
#note Not, not, not a good play. However, I did think we were going to be nickle-and-diming, because POD doesn't take a front hook. PTUI 4L is best, blocking his highest-scoring row 3 plays.
>Michael_Early: ACEILNT 3H TINCAL +25 347
#note None of Early's best plays actually involve the front hook of POD. BOFFIN 15H is best, leaving CLEAT I3 27.
>Sam: EINOR 2D IRONE +9 390
#note IRONE 4F, anyone? Don't even think I was low on time, though I don't really remember. As you may imagine, I was pretty flustered when he played the front hook to POD. Which I hadn't noticed ALL GAME. I even remember thinking to myself, "hey, what's he gonna play there, IPOD? haha I'm so smart and good at scrabble, he can't bingo on this board definitely, why is he fishing on a dead board?"
>Sam:  (E) +2 392
