>Noah: DEEHIMY 8G HEY +18 18
#note YEH is more defensive.
>Matthew_Steele: ALORSTU 7F OUR +12 12
#note Matthew says he noticed ROSULATE just after he hit his clock.
>Noah: DEEIMOZ E5 ZED +31 49
#note The best play is EM at 6E is better. That's because I usually get a high scoring play or bingo after EM, and ZED gives higher scoring counterplays to my opponent.
>Matthew_Steele: AD F5 AD. +26 38
#note Such as this.
>Noah: EIMNNOT 9H MENTION +72 121
>Matthew_Steele: EFLST 8A FELTS +41 79
#note And this.
>Noah: AEFINOR K5 FAIN.ER +40 161
>Matthew_Steele: ADIIL L2 ILIAD +20 99
>Noah: CGIKOOW J6 WO +30 191
#note Why not WOK!! DIdn't even look there.
>Matthew_Steele: AGJ 8M JAG +44 143
>Noah: CGIKORU D8 .RUCK +22 213
#note I knew the great TUGRIK, but didn't see it. That is clearly best.
>Matthew_Steele: EV B6 VE. +14 157
>Noah: ABDGIIO 10M BIG +25 238
#note BIO and BIOG G2 are both a smidgen better.

>Matthew_Steele: BU I11 U.B +15 308
>Noah: ?AEIOVW G13 WO +25 342
#note Why not at 10F, good question.
>Matthew_Steele: ORTU 14K TROU. +10 318
>Noah: ?AEEISV 2K V..E +16 358
#note Quackle wants me to fish for nines with stuff like (A)VA. I like setting up the O hook, personally.
>Matthew_Steele: AX B13 AX +38 356
>Noah: ?AEHINS 5D A..N +13 371
#note With perfect play on both sides, SHA at 5M is the best. Opp then plays QI and I go out with (S)EmIN(A). This is four points better than my endgame, if it is perfectly played, but it's also ridiculously hard to find, especially considering I didn't know SEMINA, which is, apparently, a plural of SEMEN.
>Matthew_Steele: IILNQY 15J QI +13 369
#note INLY is best.
>Noah: ?EHIS H1 HIrES +38 409
#note Any play at 8A is best.
>Noah:  (ILNY) +14 423
#note Well I came back from being a total idiot in the last game(although I still made some bad moves here) to play O.K. I continue to play well, I think, in this 8-game winning streak.
