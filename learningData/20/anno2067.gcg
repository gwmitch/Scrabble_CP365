>C-Wood: EGHOORS 8F HOG +14 14
#note This is where Chris learns a bit about placement...

>dacrON: ?EGNOOQ F8 .OG +11 11
#note I think I made this play for style. Keep in mind I was running on about 3 or 4 hours of sleep.
>C-Wood: EGHORSV E3 GROVES +28 42
#note I really don't hate this play, even though Quackle does. I guess I just like that it really opens the board

>dacrON: ?AELNOQ -Q +0 11
>C-Wood: HIILOSZ 3C ZI. +26 68
#note I think ZIG is better ZORIL. Especially given that I just traded 1. 
>dacrON: ?AAELNO 7H AbALONE +60 71
#note Forgot shogi. As for AEOLiAN or ApNOEAL, just, lol.
>C-Wood: HILOQSS 6M OH +28 96

>C-Wood: AILQSSU O1 QUAILS +54 150
>dacrON: EEMOOSU 8L MESO +43 144
#note Out of frustration, knowing I was playing badly, and knowing he probably wouldn't challenge anything i played...
>C-Wood: CEEISVW 11B VIEWS +30 180
#note keeping the pace...missed the D2 spot though...
>dacrON: EOOTTUY 10F .OUTY +17 161
#note OUTVOTE was a big too open for my taste...missed the best play again anyway...
>C-Wood: CEEJRTX 11J EJECT +33 213
#note playing off just the X at 9G for 35 is interesting. Could he know the hook?
>dacrON: ENOPRRT H10 .PTORN +27 188
#note talked myself out of of repot. I liked opening some lanes here though
>C-Wood: ADIRTUX O11 AUDIT +36 249
#note whoa...he knew it *proud*.
>dacrON: AEEFKRR C6 FREAK.ER +84 272
#note Fortunate.
>C-Wood: ENNNRWX N13 EX +39 288
#note I feel like he has to play the X here, although I guess there are enough unseeon tiles to wait one more turn and get ride of some Ns here...
>dacrON: FIIPRTU 4D F.UIT +28 300
#note Is this the first time I made a correct play?
>C-Wood: ?DNNNRW 13G D.WN +14 302
#note interesting rack.
>dacrON: ADEIPRY 8A PY. +24 324
#note I like PYE, because there is a huge chance i will get an L or an N to the ADEIR leave.
>C-Wood: ?EEINNR 5K RIN +10 312
#note Quackle of course doenst like this, but his win % is still at 60%
>dacrON: AADEILR 10C .A +8 332
#note I draw a bingo every time i play AT H3. But for god knows what reason I didn't play it. I guess I deserve to lose cuz of this. What would you do here?
>C-Wood: ?AEENNT 15D ANTE.NaE +58 370
#note the harder find of the bingos, but pENTANE is better...
>dacrON: ADEIILR H2 DI. +4 336
#note I'd have won if I'd played AT...I had like no time left so I just threw my play down, Quackle likes it though

>C-Wood: BCDIL 3G B.D +18 388
>dacrON: AEILR 1H AILER +33 369
>dacrON: AEILR --  -33 336
#note wtf!!!!! didn't think of ARIEL. I figured AILER was good!
>C-Wood: CIL L10 C.IL +12 400
#note So just like that, student beats teacher in their first meeting. How can I not be at least somewhat happy?
