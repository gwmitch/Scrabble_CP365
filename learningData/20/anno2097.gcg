>Lou_Cornelis: ENTUW H8 UNWET +18 18
#note Lou paid a lot of people a very high compliment when he told me before we started how much fun he was having at this tournament, how everybody in Division A not only knew everybody else, but seemed to be friends with everybody else. And this was with Lloyd Mills and Harriette Lakernick in the division! :) It's at times like that I'm relieved to be in what Viebranz terms the "drama-free Midwest."
>Jason: ACEERRU 12D CURA.E +16 16
#note An inauspicious start: First I spaz and drop a tile as I'm pulling in out of the bag and then I miss CREA(T)URE. Looked for a bingo, just didn't see it.
>Lou_Cornelis: VWY G11 W.VY +22 40
>Jason: AEJQRST -JQ +0 16
#note Maybe fish-happy; Q certainly hates it.
>Lou_Cornelis: IZ 10H .IZ +35 75
>Jason: AEORSTU 9B OUTEAR.S +64 80
>Lou_Cornelis: ?ABDEOR D2 BROADEs. +70 145
#note cARBO(Y)ED is the best bingo, at 80.
>Jason: DEELORS 13I RESOLED +71 151
#note Expertly drawn, Jason! (Missed (Y)ODELERS for seven more.)
>Lou_Cornelis: AIIO O11 OI.IA +21 166
#note (breaths sigh of relief) Must've been frustrating to make a pick like that on such a rich board.
>Jason: FHIKLNY L12 F.LK +32 183
#note A bunch of plays score 30-33 and have approximately equal leave. Q seems to like KH(A)LIF, 32 at 5B.
>Lou_Cornelis: AMO 14J MO.A +26 192
#note Held. For whatever reason, I didn't recall LOAM having an anagram. Must, must, MUST review fours before NYC, hopefully (but doubtfully) before Ortonville.
>Jason: AEHINUY 10A UH +26 209
#note Q likes YEH at E5, but to me, I'll sacrifice ten points to leave AEINY vs. AINU. On a board like this, I really don't want him to get two cracks in a row.
>Lou_Cornelis: AEEPV 14B PEAVE. +32 224
>Jason: AEIINTY 15A TINY +48 257
#note I took forever to make this play. It looked like the pool was consonant-heavy, making an AEI leave OK. If not, I may play YETI and sacrifice the 15. But, my track and count were off. Double-checked my count, OK. So I re-tracked the game, but found no errors. Triple-checked my count and found my mistake. "Ugh!" I said, fixing it. Lou noticed and chuckled. "I had it tracked right, I just can't add!" I said.
>Lou_Cornelis: DGINT 5C D.TING +16 240
>Jason: AEEGIIO -AEGIIO +0 257
#note OK, so the pool was consonant-heavy, not that it helped me. Still, this was one of just five exchanges vs. 13 for my opponents. And Q likes neither of my exchanges this game, saying I should solder on and play GIE at 15H for 17.
>Lou_Cornelis: INOP H1 OPIN. +27 267
>Jason: BCEILRS F8 C.B +13 270
#note WTH kind of word is CORBEILS?
>Lou_Cornelis: Q 3G Q. +21 288
#note The fourth time my opponent plays Q(I) for 11 or 21. I tell you, if I'd drawn like my opponents had, 24 blanks or not, you'd still be listening to me whine.
>Jason: EHILMRS 11A HM +20 290
#note It's a little frustrating, I play H(I)M at F4 for 14 then think "C'mon, you can get more out of HM!" Then I see this. Why isn't that voice always turned on? Why is it only on sometimes? And should I have sacrificed the point to play it at N10, like Q says? Questions, questions...
>Lou_Cornelis: ?DEEGOT N5 GOaTEED +65 353
#note Lou's a nice guy, but he's got to learn how to share blanks, as he drew all four in our two games. Of course, it's probably my fault for using my maple-leaf Protiles so nicely given to me by Pianowski. Maybe I should switch to the plain white or purple vs. Canadians... BTW, this is the only bingo. Held briefly.
>Jason: EEILRSX O7 XI +41 331
#note Q likes EXI(T)S to pull within three, but I like this play. Better to bingo, obviously, and I can still outrun if I need to.
>Lou_Cornelis: AAFJNNR 6F FA +28 381
#note When Lou told me his rack here, I said "Did you have ..." and it turns out he had JNANA at M1, which he told me was Jim Nanavati's personalized license plate. Q likes RAJA in the JNANA spot a little better; both about kill the board.
>Jason: EEILRST 2H .ERLITES +74 405
#note PELTRIES is vastly better, but I forgot it and was just so pleased the bingo line stayed open.
>Lou_Cornelis: AJLNNRS 2B JA. +24 405
#note At first I thought, "Crap! He can make a J play at L1 and win!" But all the good plays give me an out and give up (J)IAO. Now it gets interesting. Lou played JINN at L1 (Q's choice), then JINNS, then JINN, then JIN, then (under a minute on the clock) he picked up the J and played JA(B), hitting his clock. But he left the N at L3. I was pretty sure I could challenge, so I called Amanda...
>Jason: AGIO -  +0 405
#note ...and I asked what my options were. Yes, I could challenge the play off. But I noticed that I had an out with AGIO at K1. So I asked if I could keep it on (of course I could). "But how would it be scored?" I asked. She looked like she wanted to castrate me with a rusty spoon.
>Lou_Cornelis: LNNRS L2 .N +2 407
#note And, after consultation with other directors, it was determined both words would be scored, a ruling I was fine with (and would've made myself, if I'd been directing). And since I couldn't figure out how to input such a play into Quackle, I made it JAB-pass-IN, also breaking up this long story into parts.
>Jason: AGIO 1K AGIO +19 424
#note Of course, astute readers will notice I had (L)OGIA as an out if I challenge, winning by 62 (or 37 more). Did I mention that I p*ssed away a lot of spread this tournament? My second-best endgame after challenging (OI at 1L, his RAJ(E)S at 9K, AG at 11J) also wins by 25, although RAJ(E)S is hard to see. I should've held and done the math ... I assume that would be within my rights to hold the JAB/IN play. Anyway, a fun, fun game. And I would've said that even if I lost.
