>Jason: AHNOORS 8H OHO +12 12
#note Q likes HONOR, but I wouldn't call this a horrible play.
>David_Johnson: IQ 9G QI +23 23
>Jason: AEINPRS 7H PANIERS +74 86
#note At first thought "dammit, how could he block everything?" Then I remembered the front hooks to OI.
>David_Johnson: EHMORTX L7 .XOTHERM +106 129
>David_Johnson: EHMORTX --  -106 23
#note I actually liked this word; if I had an S then I probably would've let it stay and -S hooked it. But for 106 and with my rack, I had to be sure.
>Jason: FFIOTUZ M6 F.IZ +26 112
#note (Q)UIFF would've been beautiful; missed it. I specified his rack and Q still says to play FUZ(E), which gives him HEX at K3 for 53! Does the rack specification only apply to sim? Help! (FWIW, I'd play FUZ(E) if I didn't know his rack.)
>David_Johnson: EHMORTX L7 .X +34 57
#note Clearly best.
>Jason: ?CFLOTU K4 FUC. +18 130
#note Q puts it and TUFOL(I) neck-and-neck. Among words I know this is clearly best, but...
>David_Johnson: EHMORT L1 HOME +36 93
#note ...I kind of forgot I'd be giving this up. This sounds like a good time to mention that I'm terrible when I know my opponent's rack.
>Jason: ?AELLOT 1L .ALO +21 151
#note Well, I can't complain that it took until Round 6 to put something on the "Grob tally." Don't know ATEn(O)LOL.
>David_Johnson: DERTY M1 .YER +33 126
>David_Johnson: DERTY --  -33 93
#note If I'd been more confident in my fours knowledge, I wouldn't have taken almost 30 seconds to challenge.
>Jason: ?EEILRT 10E LEIsTER +76 227
>David_Johnson: DERTY M1 .YED +36 129
#note OMG, this is no good?! I so suck.
>Jason: EIINOPS 11C POI +14 241
>David_Johnson: ADRT 12B TAD +18 147
>Jason: EGIMNSU 13C MEG +30 271
#note OK, if he doesn't want to take advantage of my board-opening play, I can play shut-down too.
>David_Johnson: AAGR N9 AGA +19 166
#note Counted as 17 and uncorrected. I'd corrected a couple scoring errors of his this game, but this one I missed.
>Jason: EGINNSU 12H GUNNIES +75 346
#note Wedell sits next to me, sees I have ENSUING set up and goes "Heh." Why not just point at me and exaggeratedly mouth "he's got a bingo"? Sheesh. Obviously it didn't affect David's play, though.
>David_Johnson: KOR H12 .ROK +27 193
>Jason: EELNRSU 4I UN... +9 355
#note ULN(A)E at 11K is a beautiful play (and best). Getting a little greedy here, but I'm about to go 4-2. Who knows; spread may matter!
>David_Johnson: JT I3 J.T +18 211
>Jason: BEEELRS K9 B.E. +12 367
#note Then Wedell pulls out his PDA thingy and looks up KEEBLERS*! Double sheesh!
>David_Johnson: AT 3G TA. +11 222
>Jason: BEEILRS N5 BE. +14 381
#note "Grob tally" is up to 2 as I miss EROSIBLE.
>David_Johnson: EY H1 YE. +18 240
>Jason: ?EILRRS 14G L.RInERS +68 449
#note I love, love, love drawing the second blank in a situation like this. (rolls eyes)
>David_Johnson: DEIOV 4C VIDEO +20 260
>Jason: ACNOUVW O4 VOW +26 475
>David_Johnson: DI C4 .ID +7 267
>Jason: AAACNTU 3C AA +22 497
#note For whatever reason, I had LNRSTTW unseen. Since he was in time trouble, I didn't really want to re-track.
>David_Johnson: LNRSTW 1F WR. +9 276
>Jason: ACNTU E4 .UCAT +16 513
#note (E)C(R)U at M12 is one of about a zillion better plays.
>David_Johnson: LNST 13C ...S +7 283
>Jason: N 3L ..N +5 518
#note My spread goes from +27 to +270 in one fell swoop. 4-2 and I'd be happy with two-game splits up to 11-9. Little did I know the Tile Gods had more in store.
>Jason:  (LNT) +6 524
