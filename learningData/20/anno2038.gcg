#note Huh, this was a weird play in hindsight. Don't really remember what I was thinking. In any event, ETA F7 looks to be the play, as AINORT bingos much more often than AINRT (according to Quackle). Ex. A is second best.

#note This play sucked really badly. Something like GIVE or VEG in the same spot is far, far superior. Those two are tied atop the sim. GIVE is neat because it leves the O hook for row 7, but I'd probably play VEG given a redo. Wow, I can't believe I made a play this stupid, it's almost like I had just slapped something down speed-style.

>Robert_Quigley: BY F14 BY +31 108
#note This play took forever to count, because Robert got 30 instead of 31, and I had the opposite. We finally resolved it after a minute or two.
>Sam: AEGITUW F6 W.. +14 153
#note My thinking was that I'm blocking the two most fruitful of the three bingo lines, both row 5 and row 6 bingos. I think the problem is that I only have a 45-point lead after this, and it's fairly easy for him to reopen the board. Quackle likes more straightforward plays, such as TAWIE 5C or AUGITE 4D. TAWIE is nice when you consider that it takes no back hooks. Looking back, it's far superior to my play.
>Robert_Quigley: EGN 9C NEG +15 123
>Sam: AAEGITU 10F GA. +13 166
#note He just blocked the nice AUTOMATE D4. I had also seen I could fish the E for AUTOMATING D4 102 if he hadn't played at the spot. Quackle prefers things like LOGGIA E7, TEGUA 13J, and VAGUE 10J, which I don't like. Those all give Robert easy places to score. VAU 10J and LOGIA E7 are options I might consider, though I didn't know LOGIA. I don't think there's too much wrong with this, though.

>Robert_Quigley: BE 12J .EB +13 162
>Sam: ADEFNTU 13L AFT +16 207
#note I think I got too worried about potential opponent bingos here. AFT blocks the S-hook, but leaves the T and U open for eights. UNFED 1D scores enough to be worth it. 
>Robert_Quigley: ?DEHNOR 1B HO.NDERs +83 245
>Sam: DELMNUX 10B XU +27 234
#note Quackle favors CULMED 8J, which I didn't know. XU is sort of defensive, which isn't good, but scores enough. I got sort of screwed by the closed board I created when Robert bingoed, showing the folly of many of my earlier plays.
>Robert_Quigley: IP 2A PI +18 263
>Sam: DEFKLMN L12 ..NK +15 249
#note The best play staticly*, so maybe I underthought this. C9 NUKED wins the sim easily, despite keeping four consonants. I think the vowel-heavy bag and SSSS? lurking make NUKED worthwhile. Dunno if I saw it or not.
>Robert_Quigley: ADEHO 8J .OHEAD +48 311
#note The play I missed against Marlon. Held this for a while before letting it go. I was influenced by having played the next game adjacent to Robert's game against Rod (I think Robert won by 1), and was impressed by his word knowledge. A small sample size, I know, but he seemed like a studier.
>Sam: DEFLMOR 15L .ERF +33 282
#note I noticed an interesting gambit here, but forwent it: EL G1 2. There are bingos with 17 of the 24 unseen tiles (AEEEIIIIIORRSSSS?). The only problem is that some of them might be blocked if they can only be played in one spot (DEFOAMER, FOREDOOM, DEFORMED, DEIFORM), and I might not have seen some of the bingos (DEFOAMER, FOREDOOM, etc.) However, I still have good odds, and most of the bingos are high-scoring. KERF, on the other hand, scores 31 more points now and gives me more chances to draw an S or the blank. Any thoughts? Would anyone play EL here?
>Robert_Quigley: AIJ K5 JIA. +22 333
>Sam: DLLMOOS 2F OM +15 297
#note I sort of liked this play, fishing for SOLIDLY 3G. Quackle's favorite is SOLDO L1, which looks like it'll lose to strong human play every time. 
>Robert_Quigley: ?CIRSSU M3 CrUIS.RS +72 405
>Sam: DILLOSU 7A LI +13 310
#note Fishing for DELOUSED O1. Yes, he'll almost certainly block it, but might as well give Robert a chance to screw up. It also sets up IS 8A if and when he blocks (if I draw the EE)
>Robert_Quigley: EIILRSY O6 YI. +7 412
#note RIDLEY O6 is Champ's choice. It keeps the IS for IS 8A or SIN 14J
>Sam: DEELOSU 3F LEUD +18 328
#note ELUDE 3G is best, keeping OS for OS 8A or SON 14J
>Robert_Quigley: EILRS 8A IS +24 436
#note Robert actually had an out here. Can you find it? SINE 14J is the best play other than the outplay.
>Sam: EOS 14J SO.E +26 354
#note sIDLERS I1, which I inadvertently set up! We were both fairly low by this point, though.
>Sam:  (ELR) +6 360
