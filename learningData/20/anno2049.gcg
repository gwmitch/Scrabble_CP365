#note Should play OAR.
>Joan_Mocine: ?HIS B1 SHIn +13 272
#note (F)EH is the best play. Why didn't she find an H ender.
>Joan_Mocine:  (AO) +4 276
#note I don't get it, sometimes I play pretty well, but sometimes I play like crap. I think I play too fast, and I need to get over that. The worst is that, sometimes, I'll see good plays, but miss super-obvious ones. I think my quick play was my weakness in this game. But what I need to know, and what I am having a tough time answering, is, why is my play so inconsistent!
