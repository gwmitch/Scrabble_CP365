>Jason: CEEEIUW 8F EWE +12 12
#note Nothing too appetizing, obviously. Q sims a few plays ahead of this, but they're all close. I'd say this is one of those "style" plays, where you could ask 10 experts and get like six different responses.
>Lisa_Slankard: EZ F6 ZE. +32 32
#note Before the game, Lisa made a comment like "I like playing you, 'cause I feel we're of about equal ability." Technically, since I'm now 1708 and she's 1620 I should be offended, but I'm not. Despite polar opposite vocabularies/study methods, we are pretty evenly matched. 4-2 against her after this game, which is about right. She donated both of our meetings in Albany.
>Jason: ACDEFIU 9H FUCI +15 27
#note Mediocre. Q likes FU(ZEE), which is cute.
>Lisa_Slankard: ADITU 8K AUDIT +23 55
>Jason: ADEEMNR N4 REMA.NED +69 96
#note Missed REDEMAND and DEMANDER. "That was probably a mistake," Lisa said, but I pointed out that I had REMAINED as a double-double through the I in FUCI if she hadn't blocked. "Oh," she said, brightening a bit. (Dammit, Jason, if your opponent's about to implode, light the fuse! Don't talk her off the ledge!)
>Lisa_Slankard: IMNV 5K VIM.N +20 75
>Jason: EEIJNNS 10B JINNEES +88 184
>Jason: EEIJNNS --  -88 96
#note Genius, find your best play and find a better one! So hung up on whether or not to try JINNEES*, I missed JENNIES! STOO-PID!
>Lisa_Slankard: III -III +0 75
>Jason: EEIJNNS L1 JINN. +40 136
#note Dammit, I guess this counts as two on the "Grob tally," eh? STOO-PID! (Kiddies, this is how to lose 200+ points of equity in one game. Don't play like Uncle Jason.)
>Lisa_Slankard: ?DIORTX 2G TRIOX.De +84 159
#note "Hitting nothing," she mumbled. Forgot to double it. Sadly, I didn't catch it either. I held (and she said after the game she "was pretty sure she made it up"), but it's good, as is TRIOXIDS.
>Jason: EEELNOS 1L .EON +37 173
#note Nearly played EEL at 1G before seeing that no, she didn't block all my J plays. Fortunate, too; she had (J)IAO to dump if I left it open. A few times this tournament my brain saved me from potential disaster at the last second.
>Lisa_Slankard: AAIO H1 A.IA +15 174
>Jason: EEELLSY M11 EELY +17 190
#note I nearly exchanged keeping ELS before I saw what I'd be exchanging. Q likes YELLE(D).
>Lisa_Slankard: OO 6F .OO +12 186
>Jason: BEELORS L12 BE +18 208
>Lisa_Slankard: IR 3J RI. +14 200
>Jason: ELORSST 4B OLESTR.S +66 274
>Lisa_Slankard: CGO K11 COG +21 221
#note Scored at 19. Now shorting herself 19 points total; we have the score as 274-202 here.
>Jason: AABGHKN 3A KHAN +33 307
#note I liked the defense of this over B(L)ANK, but Q prefers it. I still like this play, though.
>Lisa_Slankard: IR A1 IR. +21 242
#note Lisa made a comment like "why do we play this game?" as she put this down. "What else would we do on a nice day outside?" I tried to joke. No response.
>Jason: ABGGHOP 5B BAG +21 328
>Lisa_Slankard: EY 6F ...EY +25 267
>Jason: GHLOPSS O11 HOLPS +40 368
>Jason: GHLOPSS --  -40 328
#note Ah, the always-fun insta-challenge. Lisa said after the game HOLP is a past tense verb. Damn people who attach meaning to the words they study!
>Lisa_Slankard: F H8 ..F +9 276
>Jason: GHLOPSS O11 SHOPS +46 374
#note Let's go back to the "only play common words" strategy, hm? Lisa was complaining about her inability to draw S's way back in round 7, and she was obviously displeased that I'd pulled all four in this game.
>Lisa_Slankard: APV 7C PAV. +12 288
>Jason: ?GILLQU 11C QUILLs +37 411
#note I was stunned to pull the blank; what were all her fishy plays about without a blank or S? Dumb play, but her mood was so toxic I just wanted the game over, to get away from the table before I breathed too deeply and got some myself. The sad part is, I think I saw QUaG for 53 at 8A and just didn't want to empty the bag on the number. Something stupid.
>Lisa_Slankard: AORTTUW C11 .UART +28 316
#note Her turn to miss the play at 8A. TWAT's 21 better.
>Jason: ADEGT 14B G.ATED +20 431
#note Yeah, not often you win by 146 (technically 127) after having two phonies challenged off. Lost 200+ points of equity, 170+ on turns 4, 5 and 12. After Berofsky's defense team finds out who put the invisible tack on his chair, I'm having them find out who hit me over the head with a shovel before those three turns.
