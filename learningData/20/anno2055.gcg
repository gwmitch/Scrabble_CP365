#note Didn't think this play was so bad at the time... Quackle ikes BIFID 12D for 22 or NAIF where I played IF.

>Phil: ABDIRSV 7E DIB +21 129
#note Best play was BOVID E7 for 22. Shoulda seen it.

#note Quackle likes it- something I figured when I begrudgingly played it.
>Seth: EINRU A6 INURE +28 268
>Phil: AALMNRS B6 NA +14 248
#note At least he didn't punish me too badly. MAN at D4 sims better, nothing too bad with NA though.

>Phil: AEELMRS B9 ..E +10 258
#note Phew- sims well. One of those plays where I figured Quackle would hate my choice.

>Phil: ADELMRS 9K D.RM +15 273
#note This play was pretty weak. I lpayed it to open some sort of lane, knowing I could at least hook my A to score big without a bingo. However, DERMAL 15J scores 33 keeping S- a much better play, but a word im not 100% on.
>Seth: AOOTT M2 TATOO +24 366
#note Both of us thought it was good for some reason. We both claimed to have seen some weird alternate spelling of TATTOO and assumed that was it. Anyone have any clue what we were thinking of?
>Phil: AAEILSS O3 ALIASES +82 355
#note Was proud of this find.
>Seth: EFK 5C KEF +36 402
>Phil: EINPTUY N1 YIP +28 383
#note At this point, I knew the Q-stick was a lock. There were two spots for the J, so I didn't bother blocking that. YIP scored 28, leaving me outplays. 
>Seth: CJLOQV C2 JOC. +34 436
>Phil: ENTU 1N .E +15 398
#note OK, so I didn't have much time left on my clock. I remember seeing UNMET and realizing that it lost by 10. So i figured I'd just play off one at a time hoping to catch up.
>Seth: LQV 6D L.. +7 443
>Phil: NTU 6L ..T. +6 404
>Seth: QV -  +0 443
>Phil: NU N9 .U +6 410
#note Here I was, evaluating my options with like a minute on my clock. I see JUN for 10, but I know I need 11 to tie. I was so pissed. I kept looking- i see MUN for 7, which is at least an outplay. Then I suddenly realize- holy crap, play it as two separate words!
>Seth: QV -  +0 443
>Phil: N N9 ..N +5 415
#note From what I saw/see, the only way to score 11. So pumped when I saw it. Anyone see a winning combination?
