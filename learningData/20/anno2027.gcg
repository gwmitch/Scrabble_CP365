>Jason: ?ACLSSU 8D CLAUSeS +72 72
#note Came thisclose to playing SAC when I finally saw this. Probably the worst of the bingos, though. Saw CASUaLS but chickened out, missed CAUSaLS and CUtLASS.
>Randy_Greenspan: CEINX 7G XENIC +46 46
>Jason: EILPRRT F8 .LP +11 83
#note And I get whacked for picking the wrong bingo, as he scores and blocks my PALTRIER/PRETRIAL. My first big mistake of the tourney; missed the star plays of PELTRI(ES), PERLIT(ES) and REPTIL(ES). Chickened out on TRI(L)LER. Not even on Q's radar. If I'm going to take five minutes on a play, I should probably make it at least decent, hm?
>Randy_Greenspan: AHY 6H YAH +39 85
>Jason: DEEIRRT 5B RETIRED +74 157
>Randy_Greenspan: BDLN C3 BL.ND +20 105
>Jason: AEIRVYZ D8 .RAZY +38 195
#note Q likes VE(L)A or VA(L)E at 4A or ZAI(R)E at F2. Can't remember which of those I considered. Randy wasn't happy after this play, but when is Randy ever happy during a game? :)
>Randy_Greenspan: DIIMT 5J TIMID +23 128
>Jason: EITTUVW 4K TUT +18 213
#note Q likes WIVE(D) better, but I'm in "Princeton offense" mode at this point.
>Randy_Greenspan: Q E4 Q. +11 139
#note One of the reasons I had a +705 spread despite an even bingo split is that my opponents were making plays like this a lot while I had a 93-point Z play and a 78-point Z play in the tourney.
>Jason: EIIOVWW F3 WI.E +20 233
#note Why didn't I play WEIR? Good question. If I get an answer I'll let you know. Was I taking the closed board to an extreme here? Hard to imagine I'd be concerned with bingos through the W...
>Randy_Greenspan: BGNO C12 BONG +21 160
>Jason: EIMOOVW 15A VO.IE +30 263
#note Missed I(N)WOVE; too satisfied with this.
>Randy_Greenspan: AHKN B10 KHAN +31 191
#note Wedell's sitting next to us (on Randy's side), and during this rack he pulls out his PDA thingy and checks a word! I didn't mind it here, but when he looked up my BEELERS* rack vs. David Johnson in round 6, I was ready to slug him!
>Jason: DEMORVW M2 MO..VE +24 287
#note As Dunlop would say, this was my losing play. Not because I missed OVER(DYES). Not because, despite playing VOMITED against Randy in our MM '06 game and learning the anagram, chickening out on MOTIVED anyway. But because I'm trying to tie up the board and missed the front hook to MOTIVE...
>Randy_Greenspan: ?AEFSTU 1G SUlFATE +92 283
#note ...you know, this one. After this, I pondered my next rack and I noticed the clock was neutralized. I pointed it out, but when Randy hit it, it ran on his time! Anyway, we replaced the clock, writing down our times, etc. and figuring out when we'd be overtime. As Randy went up to talk to Amanda at the beginning of this exercise, I turned to Wedell and said "I'm such a f***wit. I totally forgot the hook!"
>Jason: DEFILRW N7 FLEW +23 310
#note Didn't know or remember SULFATE took the -D, missing the great plays at N1. The little break to resolve the clock issue probably helped me. I mean, I'm still up and Randy has a random rack from a super-vowel-heavy pool. I tried to remind myself that.
>Randy_Greenspan: JU 9M J.U +18 301
#note Ruh roh. Somebody's closer to bingoing than they should be...
>Jason: ADIOOOR 14C .OO +7 317
#note Yeah, you know that vowel-heavy pool thing? Well, it sure looks like he's got none of it while I picked AOOO. Oh how I wished JOO* wasn't just in Spazzble! Probably should've exchanged here, but I figured this made it a little harder to bingo.
>Randy_Greenspan: AEGINPR 13E REAPING +65 366
#note "Sometimes," I think, "there IS justice in this game. I don't deserve to win and now I'm not going to."
>Jason: ADGIORS H13 .OD +18 335
#note Felt like I needed to open another lane, but Q seems to like plays dropping the G at 12A. AG, GO, AGO, etc. Looked for an unblockable big set-up for the S, didn't find it. I think after this play, I had about 55 seconds left.
>Randy_Greenspan: AEEIOOR J10 IRO.E +9 375
#note At the time of the clock malfunctioning after SUlFATE, I had 9:01 left, Randy 10:38. Therefore, I would be overtime at 15:59, Randy at 14:22. As he debated between this and OOR(I)E, his clock ticked under 18, 17, 16 and 15 minutes, me going "C'mon, tick faster!" I think when he'd finally hit his clock here, he was over time, and I'd had my winning endgame planned out.
>Jason: AAGIRST M9 .AGRA +31 366
#note Best, and almost insta-played once I determined his last rack/this was better than RIATAS at 15J.
>Randy_Greenspan: AEENO 2K NA.E +16 391
#note NAE at L10 is three better, and the simple (Z)A is two better. (I can't believe that spot never got used.)
>Jason: IST 14M SIT +20 386
#note Pay no attention to the score! I had about 12 seconds left; he went about 1:30 over. Again, I always accept donations. I win 390-371 and am 2-0 and flying high heading into a round 3 game against my "daughter," Carolyn Easter.
>Jason:  (EO) +4 390
