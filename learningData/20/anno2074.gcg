#note Humongous mistake. NEW 6H is so much better. The board isn't even bingo-conducive anyway, so why sack 17 whole points to keep a more bingo-prone leave?? This is just mind-bogglingly stupid. I'm also giving here a potentially big play on the O column. Yes, QAIDs is open, but a bingo from EIS isn't 17 points more likely than IOSU.

#note Good block, mostly taking out all five lines for eights.
>Sam: ADEIIIO -III +0 304
#note Yes, this play looks odd from the outset, but here's what I was thinking: After my draw and her play, I'm unlikely to bingo. If I can draw the Z, a 3/23 chance, I'll have ZOEAE 6B 45. That'll put me right back in the game. I didn't see any other ways to win this game without severe mistakes from Debbie. The flawed sim prefers AIOLI 13I 6, but that relies on Debbie not blocking/making mistakes.
>Debbie_Stegman: GT 3M G.T +14 362
>Sam: ADEOTTZ 6B ZO.A +42 346
#note The sim likes DATTO N11 30 slightly better. It seems very reasonable, keeping ZEE 6B stashed away for next turn. 
>Debbie_Stegman: EHN N12 HEN +29 391
>Sam: CDEILTT K9 .LD +8 354
#note EDIT, the sim winner, doesn't seem to have any ways to win as I see it. COSET J6 looks like a fine play that I didn't spot. If I pull AS, NS, SU, or SW, I have a bingo hooking to make COSETS. This play was a fish for CITRATED/TETRACID, which didn't seem too unlikely with AARRRR unseen. I didn't see or know COSET, by the way. 
>Debbie_Stegman: ARW O13 RAW +27 418
>Sam: CEIIRTT B6 .IT +12 366
#note Didn't seem like much else to do here but play this and hope for the right draw. The sim likes SIC I1, but doesn't consider that Debbie's almost definitely going to block the D at K11. 
>Debbie_Stegman: ANSV 10B VANS +21 439
>Sam: CEIRRTT C9 C.TTIER +24 390
#note TIC A7 is 9 points better, and CARTER or CART in the same spot are also superior. I seriously considered playing CRITTERLIER* 13E here, which would have completed my Long List phony attempts trifecta (ISLANDESS*, CRITTERLIER*, and OVERFATTENED*--a 10, 11, 12). Pop Quiz: Name any of the five 11-letter words that end in LIER: the words that would have fit at 13E.
>Debbie_Stegman: BIRU 15A BU.R +21 460
#note BUR A7 is four more points.
