>Elizabeth_Wood: EENTY H8 TEENY +24 24
>Noah: ?BIKLMO 9A wOMBLIK. +73 73
#note I wasn't sure about stuff like cOMbLIK(E), but I thought I was positive this was good, remembering it as meaning WOMBY. Funny. (T)OMBLIKe is easily best.
>Elizabeth_Wood: MNU F6 MUN. +12 36
>Noah: ?EGLSTV 7E G.V +11 84
#note Another bad miss. I actually think I didn't look through the O, even though I looked for bingoes. I need to make this a rote habit, looking through everywhere for bingoes, every time (well except if I have like QVV).
>Elizabeth_Wood: AQU E4 QUA. +32 68
>Noah: ?AELLST C8 S.ALLEsT +68 152
#note I didn't look for a double-double at all, I don't think. Again, just like last time, I need to look more.
>Elizabeth_Wood: AFY 10B F.Y +37 105
>Noah: ADEINSS 15A DI.A +18 170
#note Quackle likes stuff like DE(T)AINS, for some reasons I've lately been hanging on to extra esses, even though I know that it's not a good idea to.  
>Elizabeth_Wood: I 4E .I +11 116
>Noah: ENNPSSV A12 VEN. +12 182
#note O.K., what does this mean, sim likes (L)EV????? Someone explain please.
>Elizabeth_Wood: EIR 12A .I.ER +16 132
>Noah: AAGNPSS G2 GASP +20 202
#note Sim likes SA(E), probably because plenty of Is are left.
>Elizabeth_Wood: EEGIN 5G .EEING +18 150
>Noah: AEHNOSU H1 HOE +23 225
#note NOH is worth the points, besides, AESU doesn't look so bad.
>Elizabeth_Wood: ITZ J2 ZIT. +33 183
>Noah: ANNRSUW L1 WRUN. +26 251
#note WAN(G)UN is ubercool.
>Elizabeth_Wood: DIL 1L .ILD +24 207
>Noah: AFNOSTX 11F NO.TAX +26 277
#note The other placement is better because...
>Elizabeth_Wood: BDO 10J BOD +31 238
#note ...Of stuff like this.
>Noah: ACFISSW 9K CAW +27 304
#note FISC makes sense, because it sets up the case S, and doesn't give my opponent any shots at that triple, except for from W.
>Elizabeth_Wood: C L8 C.. +9 247
>Noah: FIOOSSU 8L .OIF +32 336
#note Of course (C)OOF, which I didn't see, is best.
>Elizabeth_Wood: AEPRRT 12J PARTER +38 285
>Elizabeth_Wood: AEPRRT --  -38 247
#note Thank you, Everything Scrabble.
>Noah: EORRSSU M7 R..ER +16 352
#note (F)OURS is best, I think because it blocks bingoes. She might have (F)OREPART, for all I know.
>Elizabeth_Wood: AEPRRT 12J PAR +30 277
>Noah: AHOOSSU A7 HO. +15 367
#note (N)O(s)H is the place to play these letters.
>Elizabeth_Wood: EO 2N OE +11 288
>Noah: AIJOSSU B4 SOJA +32 399
#note Another nice endgame position, can you find it?
>Elizabeth_Wood: ADEERTT A1 TREAT +23 311
#note DERATE is best here. C'mon, she didn't even think of TREAD?
>Noah: ISU 1A .UIS +5 404
>Noah:  (DE) +6 410
#note I'm really glad I'm annotating all these games. Most show really shoddy play, and I think it's good for me to look at this. There are a bunch of easy things I keep missing, and heres the main center of the issue: I USE TO LITTLE TIME ON MY MOVES. I make weird use of my time. I've noticed I play really well when I don't have the most amazing options, because I take time to weigh the plays. Remember, when you see a great play: ALWAYS LOOK FOR A BETTER ONE.
