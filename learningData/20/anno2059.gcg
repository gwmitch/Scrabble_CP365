>Jason: ANNNOSY 8H ANNOY +24 24
#note The first six I looks at were ANNNOS, and I wanted a C. This wasn't bad, allowed me to set another near-land-speed record in making my play. Couldn't imagine I was adding one to the Grob tally: SYNANON?!?!
>Melissa_Routzahn: AGLW K5 AGL.W +18 18
>Jason: ADINORS M2 INROADS +79 103
#note OK, so after this game people like Knappster, Carol Rav, Carolyn, etc. are (mostly good-naturedly) giving me sh*t for how loudly I'm announcing my scores, esp. bingos. Which can't be right; this was my only bingo of the game. Anyway, I know I get a little loud, but Mannella gave me sh*t in Dayton (before I was cool in his book) for mumbling my scores. I'm just trying not to give off tells and I like how saying each score in a (projecting confidence) clear tone. Next game Easter sits next to me and after says "I don't think I heard anything from you that game." "You've all got me paranoid now!!" I practically shrieked in response.
>Melissa_Routzahn: EGLORV 9C GROVEL +15 33
>Jason: EFLORUV D4 FERVO. +26 129
#note Missing the 106-point double-double OVERF(O)UL: A mere 85.9-point mistake to go with the 44.7 points lost for missing SYNANON. Didn't know it could be spelled FERVOUR, too; damn Canadians.
>Melissa_Routzahn: MO N6 MO +23 56
>Jason: ABIILTU O4 BIALI +39 168
>Melissa_Routzahn: DERTU E8 R.UTED +16 72
>Jason: AAEOTUU -AAOUU +0 168
#note Normally I like playing ballsy with a play like (G)ATEAU (which Q recommends). But up this most on a board dead for sevens, I just didn't feel like opening that can of worms.
>Melissa_Routzahn: FIK C3 KIF +30 102
>Jason: EEJOTTT G6 TOT. +15 183
#note Got a little obsessed with the front hook to ANNOYS. JETTO(N) at I3 is best ... sadly, I don't think I knew JETON took another T.
>Melissa_Routzahn: LUU F4 ULU +9 111
>Jason: ?EEIJTW D12 WE +23 206
#note Again, normally I like JEWE(D), but I didn't like it here. Q does, though; this gives up almost as much. Considered J(E)W as well, but didn't like the leave. I dunno, guess I played like a wimp this game.
>Melissa_Routzahn: AHOR C11 HORA +28 139
>Jason: ?AEIJTT 10H TAJ +29 235
>Melissa_Routzahn: MNP 4F .MP +10 149
#note Played P(A)N at 14B before picking it up to play this. Without knowing the leave, I think P(A)N's a better play.
>Jason: ?AEEITT N2 TAE +17 252
#note ETA(P)E's slightly better, but I'm not it a board-opening mood.
>Melissa_Routzahn: EEINSSZ 15C SEIZES +56 205
#note The good thing about this play was that I knew her leave, and, conversely, that the other blank's in the bag.
>Jason: ?AEEIQT H1 QuI. +42 294
#note I felt like if there was ever a time to burn the blank for points, this was it. Still, Q thinks just playing it straight with QAT(S) is best ... but I really didn't like drawing into ?EEI.
>Melissa_Routzahn: IN J10 .IN +10 215
>Jason: AEEEHIT K11 TAE +12 306
#note When this didn't appear on Q's radar (not even championship player), I thought "maybe I took board-closing to an extreme," but put it in sim and it rates pretty high.
>Melissa_Routzahn: CD 12B C...D +11 226
#note Beautiful play. For a second I thought I couldn't block.
>Jason: AEEEHOP B10 PE. +18 324
#note Again, not on Q's radar (not even championship player), but best in sim, and I assume the margin increases giving Melissa the blank or S.
>Melissa_Routzahn: ?CDEENN 2D DENo.NCE +67 293
#note Only bingo.
>Jason: AEHIIOX 1A IXIA +40 364
#note Looking at her last rack, I said "Well, at least I kept the vowels from you!" Clearly best; scores the most and sets up a guaranteed out.
>Melissa_Routzahn: BGRSUY 14G BURY +23 316
#note The cool three-overlap BUYS at A9 is 12 better.
>Jason: EHO J1 E.HO +9 373
#note Missed HOE at L13 for 12. Oops. I improve to 3-0 against Melissa and finish the first half 6-4, gaining about 19 points to approx. 1680.
>Jason:  (GS) +6 379
