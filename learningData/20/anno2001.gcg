#note This play doesn't even show up in the kibitzer's first 15 choices, yet sims best by a full two points. It's not hard to see why.

#note Not like I played all that well through the rest of it, but this is my "what the christ" play of the game. I sort of knew I had missed something painfully obvious on the previous turn and was starting to get cranky. I probably had like 5 minutes left at this point too. Still, wtf are you doing here.

#note I actually kind of like this play as a sort of gambit. I didn't have nearly enough time to figure out if it was sound though. I still retain winning chances  of about 25%, which isn't too far off from that of the litany of spread-safer plays. Random metal aside: Flo MOUNIER* is the drummer from Cryptopsy. Didn't give it much chance here.
