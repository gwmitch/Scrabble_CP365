>Jason: EHILLOS 8D HOLLIES +78 78
#note The first one I looked at was the S, I put the tiles on my rack from right to left, and it was basically spelled out when I pulled the last tile (which I think was the second L). Yup, I'm playing my daughter! (P.S. Did not know HILLOES.)
>Carolyn_Easter: ?ADEGIN H8 .DEAtING +77 77
#note Hey, who gave her such a good rack out of the bag? Third-best bingo behind (I)mAGINED for 80 and AmID(O)GEN for 86.
>Jason: AINQSTX G13 QI +44 122
#note Carolyn's always so nice to slot her bingos where I can get huge counterplays.
>Carolyn_Easter: AEFIINS F4 FINA.ISE +65 142
#note I made the obligatory "What's the high loss prize?" comment. Counted as 66 and uncorrected.
>Jason: ANRSTTX 9C TAX. +26 148
#note The cute R(E)T(A)X is beautiful; alas, I missed it. Plus, the cheap points for the easy extensions might not make it worth the risk. But Q says it's best.
>Carolyn_Easter: ADITV E11 DAVIT +24 166
>Jason: NPRSTTW 5D TW.RP +20 168
#note When Knappster did one of his "You like (word)?" quizzes that night at dinner about TWIRP, I could tell him this story. A nice rack cleaner-upper.
>Carolyn_Easter: BORZ D2 BOR.Z +32 198
>Jason: GNOPSTY 15A SPOT.Y +36 204
#note I tend to overvalue the S, but here I correctly jettison it for points.
>Carolyn_Easter: UY B13 YU. +16 214
>Jason: CDEGGNR 12C GR.D +25 229
#note After the bingo and before this play, I drew 17 consonants and four vowels. After this play and before my last pick, I drew three consonants and 11 vowels. When I summed this game up as "I couldn't draw a vowel, and then I couldn't draw a consonant," I wasn't exaggerating. :)
>Carolyn_Easter: IOR C9 .RI.O +22 236
>Jason: CEEGNOO 6B CO.E. +27 256
#note For whatever reason, I'm seeing plays like this a lot more than I usually do.
>Carolyn_Easter: ?AEIILN J8 .ALINIzE +59 295
#note She's got two bingos to the triple: (G)AINLIEr and (G)LIAdINE. However, it may be worth it to close the board here. I asked why she didn't play fINALISE. :)
>Jason: AEEGNOO G7 A.E +23 279
#note Q says to dump the extra E (somehow missed it) or play G(L)EE.
>Carolyn_Easter: JW 3C J.W +26 321
>Jason: EEGNOOR K9 GONE +21 300
#note At this point, I'm remembering how Carolyn passed 1500 and qualified for top div. at MvO. I'm thinking "What've I done agreeing to do that tourney?" :)
>Carolyn_Easter: ABCK L12 BACK +44 365
#note Ow.
>Jason: AEEORTU H1 TROU.E +27 327
#note I figured I needed to open the board and race for the case S. This did both. Q rated it sixth, but all the top plays are close. I'd still play this, esp. with seven vowels and 12 consonants out.
>Carolyn_Easter: EEF 15L .EEF +33 398
>Jason: AAEESUU 2G U.EA +6 333
#note When the first one I looked at was the S, I thought I was in good shape. That the other four were AEUU was frustrating, especially given the unseen pool now. I hated shutting the board down for eights, but what else to do? (E)AU at 6H is intriguing. Missed it, although Q likes UREA two of the three times I asked.
>Carolyn_Easter: DHLMMNV 3G H.LD +28 426
#note She took a while here. Carolyn likes to talk to herself and kept saying things like "I can't block" and "Does he have it?" For my part, I put my tiles in alphagram order and didn't shuffle, trying to project confidence. "And he's just sitting there with a good poker face, like he's supposed to," she said. She said she wasn't sure of H(O)LM, which looks like a guaranteed win.
>Jason: AEORSTU 4J OUSTER +18 351
#note "That should be enough to outrun the bingo," I said and Carolyn gasped. "That I don't have," I concluded. The N was in the bag. NRT, I have NATURES. NOT, I have SOUTANE. NOR, I have ARENOUS, all of which technically win by one. But remember that FINALISE is overscored by one; I think I'm down 94 here, not 93. I always take ties and Carolyn does too (as I learned when I sat next to her Lakernick tie later in the tourney), so we wouldn't have recounted. As it is, I got bupkis. *sigh* Still, can't pish away 22 points by missing (C)ARE at 14L, setting up (HOLD)OUTS, which I wouldn't have seen. And I'd only lost 10.2 equity points to this point, too.
>Carolyn_Easter: MMNNV N3 M.M +7 433
#note (U)MM at K4 is ten better.
>Jason: A 2D .A +9 360
#note Didn't notice she gave me a better out. Still, can't be upset. Played near flawlessly until the endgame, I've bagged Carolyn repeatedly the past few years, and she was 0-2. I needed the reality check anyway. :)
>Jason:  (NNV) +12 372
