>Steve_Pellinen: ACLOZ 8D COLZA +38 38
>Jesse_Day: DDEIJOU D5 JUI.ED +16 16
#note Somehow at the time nothing seemed reasonable except for JUICED, but JUDO is obviously better. Not a great start, especially if he has an O.
>Steve_Pellinen: ERYY E10 EYRY +23 61
>Jesse_Day: ADELOUV F10 VOE +36 52
#note it's this or LUV, which I'm not sure I looked at. They sim about evenly, but I think the board isn't quite open enough for me to prefer LUV.
>Steve_Pellinen: AEE 5C A.EE +22 83
>Jesse_Day: ADELNUW 9G AWL +25 77
#note my play seems to sim best, but I sort of like UNDREW. But taking the points is likely right.
>Steve_Pellinen: STW 12D W..ST +18 101
#note think he has an S?
>Jesse_Day: DEFGNNU 6F FUND +29 106
#note either this or FUN. Setting up the I wasn't a big deal to me, and quackle agrees. They sim neck and neck.
>Steve_Pellinen: AEILRST 4F REALIST +72 173
#note Awfully hard to choose a placement because they're all about the same score, but maybe RETAILS at the same spot to not put the S at the head of the double-double. 
>Jesse_Day: ?EGINTT K4 .TETtING +82 188
#note I guess SETTLING is a little bit better. didn't really think about anything else besides my play.
>Steve_Pellinen: BOU 13B BUO. +23 196
>Jesse_Day: ADEMPPR 14A DAMP +38 226
#note I thought about PREAMP, but I wasn't 100% on it being good and DAMP wasn't really that dangerous of a play. They sim about even - I suspect because it's easy for him to take the new hotspot at the bottom left without giving anything back. I hate to say it, but I might've thought about trying PREDAMP given a spot. I mean, if PREPAVE is good...
>Steve_Pellinen: DE 15A ED +24 220
>Jesse_Day: AEIPRVX 3H PAX +29 255
#note looks like a big rack, but nothing that great to do here. Quackle says TAXI at H12, seemingly because, well, it scores the most points. PAX is also worrysome as far as board dynamics for setting up a very nice S hook with two and the blank unseen. I don't get how EPRV keeps up with EIRV, though. Any ideas?
>Steve_Pellinen: Q 7C Q. +21 241
>Jesse_Day: AEINORV C3 OV. +12 267
#note quackle actually likes playing TROVE by a couple. I don't think that's the right move, though, because he seems to have been fishing, at least to some degree, for the last couple of moves, and giving him that E seems like a bad idea. Quackle also likes VIATOR, but I'll take my reasoning - OVA blocks the easiest S hook on the board and best bingo lane. maybe I was fixating too much on the S, but it seemed best to respond to a threatened bingo with a fish of my own, when outrunning him isn't possible.
>Steve_Pellinen: EHIR 8K .HEIR +33 274
>Jesse_Day: AEINRST 15D STEARIN +84 351
#note well, drawing ST to AEINR never hurts.
>Steve_Pellinen: BKNO 2B KNOB +27 301
#note scores and opens more lanes to deal with...
>Jesse_Day: EIIMNOS N6 IM.NO +11 362
#note this is a nigh on game-losing move at an important juncture of the game. My thought process was basically that it blocked the most dangerous set of lanes and set up my S for a potential play up to the triple if I end up neading the points. But IMINO at the bottom also blocks the easiest lane on the board to hit, and even more importantly, scores 11 more! I'm not up far enough to play IMINO at the other spot - by going up by 72 I allow myself a chance to respond if he does bingo next turn. IMINO at the bottom even interferes with bingos through the E as a bonus.
>Steve_Pellinen: OO 7I OO. +8 309
#note could actually have dumped them to play TOOM for 7 more...have to wonder if that could've cost him the game, given the final score...
>Jesse_Day: CEIINSU 14J UNCI +12 374
#note I could've ended the game then and there if I'd just seen INCISURE - cardbox says that I'm 3 for 9 on it, so it's perhaps not that surprising that I miised it. In fact, its win percentage is lower than some of the non-bingos anyway! Quackle is kinda fond of the crazy fish of IREFUL through REF and the L, which I sort of like - its timing is good, making him pick up 4 tiles if he bingos, and leaving me with a good flexible leave to counter. The problem with that might be that it allows him to keep fishing without allowing me enough spread or enough tiles in the bag to start blocking the lanes. My play is about as good as bingoing, but better is INCUS - makes some sense to me because it leaves me up 75, and if he does hit the top lane or the right he only gets 1 tile, which often scores less than picking up 2 (at least in my experience). I'd love to hear someone else's opinion on all this.
>Steve_Pellinen: ?AEGGIR 1D GARIGuE +89 398
#note wow! steve makes the best bingo against me all tournament, right up there with Edley's TRACHEA. By finding the improvement on the obvious stuff like NAGGIER, steve increases his win percentage by 25%!
>Jesse_Day: EFHILST O10 FILTHS +44 418
#note lucky me that I had a very timely draw. Looking at it now, I have to wonder - did I doubt myself on ELFISH and play FILTHS because I knew I had the win in hand, or did I just not see it? It really doesn't matter in the least, but I'm very surprised that I didn't play ELFISH. I hope that I would've seen it if I had to.
>Steve_Pellinen: AR 3C .RA +12 410
>Steve_Pellinen:  (E) +2 412
#note I didn't do a great job of holding onto my lead, but it was nonetheless very satisfying to do just enough to be able to hold onto a win, and to finally go above .500 for the tournament! At this point I even had visions of returning to the golden pastures where the 1800s dwell. Little did I know that this would be my last win of nationals.
