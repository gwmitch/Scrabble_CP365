>George_Viebranz: ?BFJLRS -BFJL +0 0
>Jason: AACMNRY 8G CANARY +30 30
#note Jason: Did not know CAYMAN. Now I do.
>George_Viebranz: ?AFRSTU J8 .RF +14 14
#note George: Missed a few bingos that I should know (FURCATES, for example), but my play isn't awful.
>Jason: AAEMNRS K10 AM +13 43
#note Jason: Yeah, there's a lot worse six-tile picks than AAENRS. Three spots to play off AM for 13 points. Naturally, I choose the one that Q rated 15th-best the first time around and off the radar the second time. Q likes playing AM at 7K, and I'm surprised it's so clear-cut.
>George_Viebranz: ?AESTUU 12G AUTEUrS +69 83
#note George: Luckily, the best bingo is the only one I could find.  I don't know SUBACUTE or AUGUSTER yet, but I got by on this one. 
>Jason: ADENRRS 13B ERRANDS +77 120
#note Jason: It seems like a lot of times this tournament I could counteract an opponent's big play with one of my own, like this game.
>George_Viebranz: EEEHIIN G6 NI.HE +15 98
#note George: Hahaha... not even close to being a halfway decent attempt at making something that could be considered "a play."  HI(R)EE down in the bottom left is best.
>Jason: BDEEGIL 6A BLEEDI.G +66 186
#note Jason: Genius here is thisclose to playing BLE(E)D at B10 or something when I finally notice. Oh, there's an open N. And I have IG. Do the other five letters make a verb? Eureka!
>George_Viebranz: EEEEIIO -EEEIIO +0 98
#note I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come out from under the table, because this sequence should only happen on PUNK'D.
>Jason: ?BDDEHP 5D HEP +31 217
#note Jason: One of a number of good options. Take your pick; it's probably got between a 95-97% win rate.
>George_Viebranz: AEJLORT A4 JA.OT +66 164
#note George: Hey! There's a good play!
>Jason: ?BDDGIN B10 BID.D +30 247
#note Jason: Again, hard to make a bad play here. GIB(E)D or BING(E)D in the same spot are roughly equivalent.
>George_Viebranz: EILRVVW L3 LIVER. +24 188
#note George: Another pathetic attempt.  To be fair, I don't know W(HE)RVE, but there are better options.  I guess it does open things up though.
>Jason: ?EGIINU M9 GUI.E +16 263
#note Jason: Dropping 3.5 equity points through six turns is boring, so let's add a missed bingo to the tally. Among words I know (FIGULINE doesn't qualify), this is best. Chose it over GUI(L)E for fear of a big X bomb at 2J.
>George_Viebranz: KOTTUVW F9 OW +31 219
>Jason: ?IIMNWX H1 MIXIN. +51 314
#note George: And I'm all, "really?"
>George_Viebranz: EGKTTUV -GKTVU +0 219
#note George: K(HE)T.  But I was really done with this UV combo.
>Jason: ?IOOSTW E10 OW +16 330
#note Jason: I was waiting for someone to make a cool J play along row 4, hooking the S or T to HE. My inability to see the S as anything but a bingo tile hurt me here; (J)OWS or (J)OIST is best, I think. Don't ask why I didn't play this at A14. Well, you can, but I don't have an answer.
>George_Viebranz: EENOTTY D4 T..Y +20 239
>Jason: ?IKLOST 2F KO. +17 347
#note Jason: I'm surprised I only missed one bingo here. I saw KILOb(I)TS, but didn't have the guts to pull the trigger. I hate even potentially losing turns in a situation like this, esp. after what happened vs. McKenzie. Besides, the good non-bingos are close equity-wise.
>George_Viebranz: EEFNORT D12 T.EF +22 261
>Jason: ?ILSSTU 15D .LUtISTS +80 427
#note George: I'm like Biggie, givin' ends to my friends.  It feels stupendously awful. 
>George_Viebranz: AEENOOR 3G E.ON +16 277
>Jason: EGOPQVZ 6J ZE. +32 459
#note Jason: Having won the game, my brain was in one of its patented "Yay, let's shut off until the next game starts!" moods. G(E)EZ through that E; Q says nothing else is close.
>George_Viebranz: AAAENOR A14 AA +9 286
#note George: There are even 3 better places to play AA.
>Jason: GIOPQTV M2 QI +26 485
#note Jason: Wasn't sure if this was best or not, but Q says it is, so who am I to argue?
>George_Viebranz: AELNOOR B2 ONO +15 301
>Jason: CGOPTV N8 COP +26 511
#note Jason: Wow, I didn't realize the level of garbage George drew until I saw his racks. Props to him for taking it like a man. I'm so glad that combined we left with 100+ more rating points than we started. Nice tourney, George.
>George_Viebranz: AELR N3 EARL +9 310
#note George: REAL would have gone nicely in the spot for which I unknowingly set it up. 
>George_Viebranz:  (GTV) +14 324
