#note Good thing I got rid of that UW combo last turn, huh?

>Carl: ADEIMTU 8A MAUT +24 77
#note Why not IDEM? What in the name of Gurgleby Falton was I thinking? Or if I must unload the U, I could have at least played DUMA. Jetlag or stupidity? You be the judge.

>Carl: DEIINOR 12C ID +16 93
#note And I should have seen that OI in the same place is much better. At the time, I remember thinking that the O hook for AD might come in handy; besides which, I might draw the Z. As Johnny Cochran would say: That does NOT MAKE SENSE!

#note Quackle prefers DROLL D1. It wins three times more than DIRL! (.21% and .07% of the time, respectively.) Clearly, this is where it all went wrong.
>Ian_W: JOTY N6 JO.TY +39 429
#note Not for nothin' do they call him the JQXZ doc.
>Carl: AFKLORS O5 KORS +53 299
#note Ok, would you have taken the points here, or would you have done the more conservative KAF 4C? Or perhaps KORS N1, which wins sometimes, according to Quackle?

#note I should have switched gears to block my opponent's out-play. LEVY 3A is best, followed closely by AGLEY. Or if I'm gonna do something dumb, I should have at least have played LEAF, the correct dumb play.
