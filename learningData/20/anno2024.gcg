>Sam: EELOPTU 8D LOUPE +16 16
#note Jeez, talk about a poor start. I've seen the word EELPOUT before maybe once or twice, and I probably wouldn't have challenged it, but to be honest I would never have found it. The good news is it's in the next set of 100 I'm gonna add to my cardbox. At least I made the right choice between LOUPE and TOUPEE...
>Orry_Swift: EFINORU D7 F.UORINE +72 72
#note This might not have stung so much if I had had a bingo of my own to start the game!
>Sam: EENRTVX 14A VEX.R +30 46
#note XU 9C and EXERT C11 both sim slightly better. XU is actually pretty interesting on this wide-open board, and perhaps I should have considered it. In hindsight, I like it better than VEXER.

>Sam: ?ANSTTT 3C STATT.Ng +68 156
>Sam: ?ANSTTT --  -68 88
#note Wow, this is incredibly embarrassing. TATTINGS, ATTAINTS, ANTISTAT, TITRANTS, and NATTIEST are the real bingos here. Of course the kicker is that I saw NATTIeST on the way back from the challenge booth. If you're going to play a phony bingo, at least take enough time to check for real ones! I didn't know the other bingos very well at all, but TITrANTS is best. And to think these aren't the worst of my errors yet...
>Orry_Swift: ?EGLNOS 3C rESOL.NG +70 234
#note Nice block.
>Sam: ?ANSTTT F2 T.T +5 93
#note Quackle prefers TATS F11. I think my play has more merit, though, with only one S unseen and both blanks on the board. 
>Orry_Swift: AHM E10 HAM +32 266
>Sam: ?ADNSTY 1B DyNASTY +87 180
#note STANDbY, which I wouldn't have trusted to be good even if I saw it, is 96 points at 1F and best. I even chickened out on DYNASTs, which would have at least served as challenge bait, if nothing else.
>Orry_Swift: EIKMOST 10H .MOKIEST +68 334
>Sam: ADEHIJR M9 H.JIRA +40 220
#note JEHAD in the same spot is easily superior. Just didn't see it. In a normal game I'd be pissed at myself, but this was probably one of my better plays in this game, despite the huge error. Drowning in a sea of equity loss.
>Orry_Swift: AEFORV O4 OVERFA. +42 376
>Sam: CDEENTZ -  +0 220
#note Yes, I challenged OVERFAT. See, my reason was that I had just learned OVERFAST, and for some reason had a vivid memory of looking up OVERFAT and it not being good. DITZ 12L is best.
>Orry_Swift: ABBE K10 .EBAB +26 402
>Sam: CDEENTZ O4 .......TENED +60 280
>Sam: CDEENTZ --  -60 220
#note Hey, nothing to lose here except...my dignity. And a million more equity points. ZED 4B is best among plays that score points.
>Orry_Swift: IOQT 6G Q.OIT +16 418

>Orry_Swift: GIP 5J PIG +20 438
>Sam: CDELNOT 12K .L.N +12 265
#note Both setting up the D for O12 and distracting him from my real plan--fishing for AR for DEMOCRAT I8!
>Orry_Swift: EW N6 WE +28 466
>Sam: CDENOOT J5 ..C +7 272
#note There's gotta be a great chance to pick an I here for DEMOTION I8, right? 1/3 by the odds, and he didn't even play an I on his last play, so possibly even higher than that. Maybe I should just cut my losses with DECO O12 for 37.
