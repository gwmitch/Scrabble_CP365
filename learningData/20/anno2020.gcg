>George_Viebranz: DDLRRSU 8G RUDD +12 12
#note This looked like the only choice other than exchange.  Q likes it.  
>Randy_Greenspan: ?DILNTU K2 INDULTs +70 70
#note One of those words I "know" but don't know.  Sounds good enough, and I know I can hit back.
>George_Viebranz: AEILNRS 4F ISLAN.ER +70 82
#note SUV BELONGED TO GREENSPAN.
>Randy_Greenspan: EIKLMNN 9B LINKMEN +70 140
#note Maybe I should have held this.  I didn't know it, all I really had to convince me it was good was that it sounded good.  That rationale has bitten me in the past, and will bite me again in the future. 
>George_Viebranz: AEELTWY E6 WEA.LY +32 114
#note Q's 6th best play, but only 2.2 points back from TRAWLEY M3.  WETLY and WELLY H1, AYE 10E and TWEAKY E5 are also better.
>Randy_Greenspan: AEGOU M2 AE.UGO +16 156
#note "AER U GO givin' me a spot for my bingo!"  (thank you, thank you... I'll be Quackling all week)
>George_Viebranz: EIMORTT N6 OMITTER +72 186
>Randy_Greenspan: AOW H1 AWO. +21 177
#note A.W.O.L., the final track on the Beastie Boys' Paul's Boutique, samples the following songs:  "Good Times" by Chic, "Good to Go" by Trouble Funk and "Loran's Dance" by Idris Muhammad.
>George_Viebranz: ACEHIVZ 8A ZA +35 221
#note Who ordered the ZA, chives on the side?
>Randy_Greenspan: ADIS N1 AIDS +27 204
#note DAIS O8
>George_Viebranz: CEFHIUV J2 HU. +29 250
#note I hate to keep the V, but this scores and covers a volatile spot.
>Randy_Greenspan: EOPX O12 EXPO +45 249
#note The only person I can remember being on the Montreal Expos is Andre Dawson.
>George_Viebranz: CCEFIOV M11 FOCI +26 276
#note 4th best.  FOLIC 10C is gorgeous.  I did not see it.
>Randy_Greenspan: IQ L14 QI +23 272
#note Fun fact: If you want to do a pattern match in Zyzzyva to find all the 8s ending in I (???????I) but forget to change Anagram Match to Pattern Match, you end up with 16,127 words.
>George_Viebranz: ACEJNOV 2F JO. +29 305
#note 2nd to CAJON D3, which I did not see. 
>Randy_Greenspan: GG C8 G.G +18 290
>George_Viebranz: ACENOSV 10E .AV +20 325
#note Best.  I don't know where I'm going to bingo, but I don't know what else to do.  He blocked (AL)COVES, which I would have played hesitantly due to the fact that the blank is still out.
>Randy_Greenspan: ?EEEFRT J8 .EFEREnT +69 359
#note Whoomp.  There it is.  
>George_Viebranz: ACEINOS 15C CANOEIS. +83 408
#note One of the 13 racks I know cold.
>Randy_Greenspan: Y 1N .Y +15 374
#note At this point I'm fairly sure he can't bingo again.  I have the last A and O, so the D lane isn't a threat.  He's either over on time or very close to it.  Still, I don't feel like I'm out of the woods.  He might see something I don't.
>George_Viebranz: ABHORST 14F HOB +35 443
#note Best.  
>Randy_Greenspan: EENPRTV 13C VENT +20 394
