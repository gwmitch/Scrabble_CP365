>Jeremy: ILNNTTW 8F TWIN +14 14
#note Best.
>Lou: JO F6 JO. +26 26
>Jeremy: EFLLNRT J8 ELF +22 36
#note J7 FELL beats this by 0.1 points, close enuf.  My move closes the board, but also keeps too many consonants.
>Lou: AGS 9D GAS +15 41
#note I can see Lou must have another A and another S setting himself up for a hook here.
>Jeremy: LMNNRTW -LMNW +0 36
#note I draw nothing but consonants, and keep NRT.  Quackle likes keeping just NR or RT, but both are within a half point.
>Lou: ACIINNS C7 NIACINS +78 119
>Jeremy: ?BEGNRT H3 BERaT.NG +61 97
#note Missed 11A BR(I)GhTEN for 9 more.
>Lou: AAEE 5G A.EAE +10 129
>Jeremy: BEEHOPU B2 PHOEBE +40 137
#note Best.
>Lou: DUW A7 WUD +27 156
>Jeremy: DEINOTU 3H .OUNTIED +74 211
#note It's the only bingo.  I don't know many anamonics, but BEDOUIN plays through consonants of CLOUDIEST.  There are some cool words in that set.
>Lou: EILRRTU 13C .ULTRIER +60 216
>Jeremy: ?ADDEEL O1 LA.DErED +158 369
#note I take about four minutes to summon up the chutzpah to play it.  Pretty sure it's good, and if I strike out, I can bingo next turn guaranteed.
>Lou: AIV C1 VIA +26 242
#note Lou knows it's good.
>Jeremy: GMORRSV H12 V.MS +39 408
#note Best.  Quackle says I have a 99.88% chance to win.
>Lou: AOP D2 APO +23 265
>Jeremy: CFGORRX 15D FROG. +13 421
#note Best. Closes the board and wins 99.99%
>Lou: IIZ L1 ZI.I +46 311
>Jeremy: CEHNRUX E4 XU +27 448
#note Dang.  Lou blocks my2J XU.  Quackle likes 14F HU(M) or HE(M) above my play which sims nearly the same.  All are 99.99% winners.
>Lou: AKOY K9 OAKY +29 340
>Jeremy: CEHLNRY 11B L.CH +18 466
#note I have LYNCHER unplayable.  Lou overdraws while I look at this rack.  I see IOT, and toss the T in the bag.  I have also mistracked and crossed off the other T.  So I am going for NERT(Z), unaware that Lou has TROO(Z), or worse.  The top play here is 6H (a)RYL which wins 100%.  My play of L(I)CH has a really high valuation, but only wins 97.96%.
>Lou: EIMOORT 1F MOTORI.E +107 447
#note WTF!  Where'd that T come from.  Dang it.  Am I going to lose because of that error?
>Jeremy: AENQRSY L12 AERY +32 498
#note EASY or AERY or 2A A(PIA)RY are the same.  Best at -2 valuation.
>Lou: T 11B ....T +10 457
#note Phew.
>Lou:  (QSN) +24 481
