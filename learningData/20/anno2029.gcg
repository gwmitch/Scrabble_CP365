>Kelly_McKenzie: AINORSW 8D WARISON +78 78
#note Given what would happen next, Kelly wondered after the game if this was the best placement. Q says take the points.
>Jason: HHILRUU 7G HUH +37 37
>Kelly_McKenzie: ABCORT E3 ACROB.T +22 100
>Jason: EILORSU K5 LOUSIER +89 126
#note Yeah, with an opening rack of HHILRUU, I figured I'd have about 124 through two turns. (rolls eyes) I don't think I have a better three-tile pick here than EOS.
>Kelly_McKenzie: EX F5 EX +52 152
>Jason: FGJKNRT 3C FR.NK +34 160
#note Why I'd rather be consonant-heavy than vowel-heavy. You can sometimes score 34 with seven consonants, but you ain't doing it with seven vowels.
>Kelly_McKenzie: ?EEGILU 11D bEGUILE. +66 218
#note Said he wasn't sure of it. Only bingo. I should've at least held, but I didn't want to risk losing a turn and having my comeback blocked.
>Jason: ACEGJPT J4 TAJ +53 213
#note Quite happy that the A was the first one I looked at. Again, what's high loss prize?
>Kelly_McKenzie: DDELM H10 M.DDLE +36 254
>Jason: CDEGGPS L4 PEG +26 239
#note Missed the star play of P(E)GGED at J10 or 10J.
>Kelly_McKenzie: AIO F10 A.IO +7 261
>Jason: ACDGSTW 10J W.D +28 267
#note It's close between this and adding the A at 10I for MAWED. The pool's vowel-heavy enough MAWED should be OK, but I still like WED.
>Kelly_McKenzie: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 261
>Jason: ACGIOST D6 CA. +24 291
#note Q really hates this play (eleventh-best, although I only ran it once) and I don't know why. Thoughts? I really don't see how the ten plays above it (four of which start at H1) are better.
>Kelly_McKenzie: AETZ 12A ZETA +48 309
>Jason: ?AGIOST A12 .IGS +42 333
#note OK, Grob, how do we handle this? Obviously there are bingos here, but ZIGS' equity is 70.5 compared to the highest-scoring bingo being 70, neither of which block this hot spot. Q agrees with me on this play. Obviously I didn't miss all the bingos; I say you bow to my genius and not count it against me. OK? :)
>Kelly_McKenzie: FIR M3 RIF +23 332
>Jason: ?AEOQTY 13C OY +19 352
#note I don't know why I didn't play QA(T) at 4H; just didn't feel like it. Maybe to set up (L)IQuATE? This is fairly close, though.
>Kelly_McKenzie: UY 14A .UY +20 352
>Jason: ?AEIQTT I3 QI +23 375
#note Considered (L)IQuATE, but I overestimated Kelly's leave after GUY. Shouldn't have been scare of opening another lane by playing it at 2B, either. Q says the latter's best, LIQuATE third, mine fifth.
>Kelly_McKenzie: ENP N2 PEN +17 369
>Jason: ?AENOTT 13H .ETONATe +68 443
#note Would've been nice to know TOmENTA and play it at O4. As it is, I'm still sweating bullets.
>Kelly_McKenzie: DNV O12 V.ND +33 402
>Jason: EIMNOOR O3 IONOMER +90 533
>Jason: EIMNOOR --  -90 443
#note Yes, I is idiot. Not much more needs to be said.
>Kelly_McKenzie: EV B10 VE. +14 416
#note Kelly now knows the three in the bag and could fish for a specific combo, but he was in so much time trouble it would've been impossible to figure it out so fast. (HO)VE(L)/(M)E(WED) might've made me throw up.
>Jason: EIMNOOR O3 MERINO +39 482
#note A guaranteed win, after I tried to give it away.
>Kelly_McKenzie: AAEILST L12 A.TI +10 426
#note Obviously he had better plays, but again, he was in real time trouble.
>Jason: BO N6 BO +22 504
#note Played Kelly four times, scored 500 in three of them, two giving me "high game of the tourney" prizes. Sorry, K-Mac. 3-1 heading to lunch.
>Jason:  (AELS) +8 512
