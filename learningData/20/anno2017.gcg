#note Setting up ZA F10
>Steve_Pellinen: EIRTW H11 TWIER +38 60
>Sam: AAGHIUZ 11E HA.. +14 30
#note Again setting up ZA/ZAG for a minimum 64. It's fairly unlikely he'll block this. Unsurprisingly, Quackle hates this, ranking GHAZI F11 best. What do you think: Was this an inspired setup, or was I just getting too cute? I think it's the latter, but all opinions welcome.
>Steve_Pellinen: DEIRTUU I4 PILOSAN +73 133
>Steve_Pellinen: DEIRTUU --  -73 60
>Sam: ADGGIUZ F10 Z.G +64 94
#note I held my breath, hoping that Steve wouldn't find OPALINES. Against another player, I might play GIGUE to block, but I decided to take a risk here.
>Steve_Pellinen: DEIRTUU 7A PIANOL.S +63 123
>Steve_Pellinen: DEIRTUU --  -63 60
>Sam: ADEGISU I2 GAUDIES +73 167
>Steve_Pellinen: AILNOPS H1 PAN +20 80
#note Why not LAP in the same spot?
>Sam: BBEEOTY G13 BYE +25 192
#note I saw WEBBY, but wanted to shut down some lanes given Steve's decent leave (ILOS). Maybe I shouldn't have worried too much, but ER are premium tiles to play through for eights. Quackle prefers WEBBY.
>Steve_Pellinen: IILOOOS 5I .IOL +10 90
>Sam: BEEENOT 4K BEEN +20 212
#note Quackle prefers BEETLE, but I liked shutting down the S-hook for sevens.
>Steve_Pellinen: D 6I .D +14 104
>Sam: AEOOTUW 3M WOO +24 236
#note Further closing down the board. Steve's obviously close, but he'll have to be able to hook his bingo to the A, start it with T (GAUDIEST), make an eight with the W in TWIER, or play a nine.
>Steve_Pellinen: EINOORS F1 EROSION +63 167
#note And it does fit. I assume that Steve kept EINORS when he played ID, but luckily I didn't get ROSINED (none of the anagrams fit either).
>Sam: AEGJRTU 1A JUGAT. +45 281
#note BIJUGATE 13G, which I didn't see, is cool. Had I seen it, I'm not sure I would have played it--Steve just had a full draw to pick some good stuff (SSX??), and I'm danging the full GATE of the play. 
>Steve_Pellinen: DEFT 2L DEFT +36 203
>Sam: EELNORX E1 .ELEX +48 329
#note I thank our friends Radiohead for this play (for those of you who don't know, the opening track of "The Bends" was called "Planet Telex").
>Steve_Pellinen: CHINR C1 .RINCH +24 227
>Sam: ?NNORVY -NVY +0 329
#note NERVY 15F is my play +11 points +defensive value. Ugh.
>Steve_Pellinen: IKP 6L KIP +22 249
>Sam: ?INORTT M6 .NTROITs +68 397
#note I didn't want to slot anything in the O column with a seven at 9I. The neat INTROvERT 15A is best, but of course I didn't see that.
>Steve_Pellinen: ?EMRRSU 15A MURdER..S +80 329
#note Great find, Steve! The only other bingo is dEMURRERS, which I would have certainly held. I think the ERER pattern is pretty tricky; when he was laying it down, I thought to myself, "What sort of word ends in ERERS?" before he put down MUR?
>Sam: DEILOTV 13G ..D +8 405
#note Fishing for one of the three As for VIOLATER. I definitely got way too cute this game. INVEST 4B looks best.
>Steve_Pellinen: AAAFLVY 8M .AV +18 347
>Sam: EILLOTV 6H L.. +4 409
#note Now is a better time to fish, though still improper. He's probably holding at least one more A given TAV. Something like J9 VIOLET is fine. Just wrap this one up.
>Steve_Pellinen: AACFNOY 10M .F +13 360
>Sam: EILOTVY 7C YO +29 438
>Sam: EILOTVY --  -29 409
#note VOTIVELY is good!!! I saw it, but chickened out. I had no idea though, and would have challenged if someone played it on me. I tried to get smart here with GRINCHY/YO.
>Steve_Pellinen: AACMNOS B6 ANCOMAS +76 436
>Steve_Pellinen: AACMNOS --  -76 360
#note Put a scare into me.
>Sam: EILOTVY 12J VIT.LE +20 429
#note Best for those of us who don't know the word VOTIVELY.
>Steve_Pellinen: AACMNOS K9 MAN.OCA +22 382
#note This doesn't work because it gives me OY J9 for 30. CAMIONS or ANOSMIC through the same I are best. He went over on time here, so his final score was 372, not 382.
>Sam: OY J9 OY +30 459
>Sam:  (S) +2 461
