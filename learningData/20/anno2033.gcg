>Gary_Smart: MOW 8G MOW +16 16
>Noah: CHLRRRX -HLRRX +0 0
#note I knew CH was synergistic, just didn't even think about keeping an H.  Exchange LRRX is the best.
>Gary_Smart: IQ 9F QI +17 33
>Noah: ACEFIRT 10E FIR +26 26
#note I knew the hooks were very dangerous, but didn't play accordingly. FICE is great, because of a better score, defense, a good leave.
>Gary_Smart: ?DEFGST J2 FiDGETS +80 113
>Noah: ACCEOTT 4H CA.ET +22 48
#note Missed a lot of plays here, including TOCCATE, which I didn't know, but would have played if i found it, even if i wasn't sure.
>Gary_Smart: BHIR H1 BIR.H +36 149
>Noah: CILOORT E10 .LOC +18 66
#note I've got to look for bingos, through ALL THE LETTERS, EVERY TIME. I think I looked a little here, but not thru the R, where the nice TRICOLO(R) would have played. I haven't analyzed any of the other games from labor day besides the first two, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was my worst one.
>Gary_Smart: EOPRU 3C POURE. +18 167
>Noah: EIIJORT 7H JO.TIER +31 97
#note I created equity! I was surprised this was not good.
>Gary_Smart: ENNY 2J .ENNY +22 189
>Noah: AEEIKMU -  +0 97
#note A stupid challenge. I remembered trying to play FENNIES once against Quackle, but it isn't good. I should have checked for FENNY. It's an adjective.
>Gary_Smart: LOWY 12D W.OLY +30 219
>Noah: AEEIKMU H12 .EUK +33 130
>Gary_Smart: AEEHNSV N7 .ESHAVEN +94 313
>Noah: AEGIMNN -  +0 130
#note Another bad challenge.
>Gary_Smart: BIO 1K BIO +15 328
#note Why not OBI for 9 more points?
>Noah: AEGIMNN O8 MIEN +39 169
#note I didn't know the nice N(O)NIMAGE, unfortunately. This is 2nd.
>Gary_Smart: ?AAEIRS C3 .ARAdISE +60 388
>Noah: AGGLNRV 8A GR.G +24 193
#note GAVEL is nice, because GNR is an excellent leave, I think.
>Gary_Smart: ADDDEL B10 ADDLED +26 414
#note (R)ADDLED is 10 more points.
>Noah: AAALNUV 12L VA. +18 211
#note I wanted to try to get LAZAR or LEZ to cut the spread, but VA(R)NA helps accomplish this along with keeping a better leave.
>Gary_Smart: Z 6B Z. +31 445
>Noah: AAALNOU B4 LA.A. +19 230
#note ANA is more points, and thats the concern here.
>Gary_Smart: NTU O13 NUT +13 458
>Noah: ANOOTUX C13 OXO +38 268
>Gary_Smart: EIIPST 5E PIT. +18 476
>Noah: ANTU 5L AUNT +6 274
#note Why not TUNA!
>Noah:  (EST) +6 280
#note Well, missed a ridiculous amount of stuff this game. I've got echelons to go until I get where I want to. I need to think about moves more(and think more clearly) and look for those bingoes! Also, studying will help a lot.
