#note Awkward rack here.  Kibitzer seems to prefer the higher scoring plays, which all keep the JZ.  I preferred to give up points for the turn to shed one of the two high pointers.  Two reasons for playing this hear instead of through the I: to block the K-column and to keep the spot for FIZ open if nothing better develops.

>Dave: BCEEFLR D8 C.BER +24 69
#note There are several similar scoring plays here.  I liked this one for leaving only one high pointer on the rack without shedding two many points.  The fact that I've still got the FE 10F spot for the next turn is also in its favor.

#note I don't think I've had a single game with Johnny O in which he hasn't made at least one stylish play.

#note I debated for a while between this and FAB 10B.  FEMUR E11 is another good play that I might not have seen. (I really don't remember.)  In the end, I liked this one because it not only scored, but took away what could be a good scoring lane for him.  I also thought ARTU was not that bad a bingo leave with all the letters that were open.

>Dave: AIORRTU 9L OUR +9 151
#note I missed the very nice play RATIO 14B here.  However, given how far behind I am, this might be nearly as good.  I keep my best bingo leave and create another lane, if I can draw an S.

#note John wisely plays for turnover and blocking bingo lanes over the next few turns.

#note The beginning of the comeback.

#note I was 100% sure that there was a bingo through the E, but I couldn't remember if it was this or SWATHIER#.  Eventually, I convinced myself that this was the right one, but not before burning a lot of time on the clock.

>Dave: ADEMNSU C1 MEDUSAN +82 359
#note At this point, I'll bet that John was having memories of the furious comeback I mounted in our last game.  Turns out the final spread of this game would be the same as that one.

#note I figured I needed the points and needed to take away the easy Q plays from him, and maybe just maybe if he couldn't get enough tiles down quickly I could steal this one.  I searched for alternatives until I was down to about 19 seconds on my clock, but eventually settled for this.  Turns out this loses 100% of the time, if he plays correctly.  There is ONE play that gives me a ONE POINT win if ONE specific tile is in the bag.  I never would have had time to figure it out during the game.  This play really has nothing to do with strategy.  It's just a brute force calculation of sequences of moves for the two of us.  Turns out the right tile wasn't in the bag anyway, but it is instructive to see that there is hope even in seemingly hopeless situations.
>O'Laugh: EEKOQRS 2B S.EKER +32 428
#note This is the one play that outruns me, while letting me go out next turn.  But even better was ROOSE 10G, which blocks both of my spots for PANIC.  Still, John can be forgiven for taking the sure win and expediting the end of the game, since his meatloaf dinner was still sitting right next to the board uneaten.

#note This time I was the one who was four points short.
