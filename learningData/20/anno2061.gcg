>Jason: EEEHIWY 8F WHEE +20 20
#note I just didn't like WHEY in the same spot keeping EEI. But Q does.
>Dan_Stock: ?LNOPRT I7 T.RPiNOL +62 62
#note P(E)TRONeL's one more, but Dan knows what he's doing slotting that I where it is.
>Jason: BEIMMTY H13 BEY +30 50
>Dan_Stock: ?DDGNNU 11D DeNUD.NG +86 148
#note Like I said, he knew what he was doing slotting the I where he did.
>Jason: IIMMRTU -  +0 50
#note It was like EXOTHERM ... I liked it but I felt obligated to challenge. Maybe it's a frustration mistake; I dunno.
>Dan_Stock: EVX 12C VEX +40 188
#note You know, Stocky, when you said before the game you were "drawing like a fiend," I would've taken it on faith, you didn't have to show me. :)
>Jason: IIMMRTU J14 MU +21 71
#note U(N)TRIM/(VEX)T is nice; alas, I didn't know it. How do you UNTRIM, anyway? What, I trim my beard then try to untrim it by putting the hairs back on?
>Dan_Stock: DEOV 10C DOVE +30 218
#note Hats off to Dan on a great tourney; 11-5 before an 0-4 Monday and we're each at 1708. Dan started 0-1 and when he saw he was playing Mills in round 2, he said "well, looks like 0-2." When he led at 4-1 after five, I asked how he went from 0-2 to 4-1. "I went four and negative one," he deadpanned. Fair enough. :)
>Jason: AIIMRTT 9B AIM +17 88
#note Q likes TI at 13E.
>Dan_Stock: INNSTTU K4 STUNTIN. +68 286
#note As Chick Hearn used to say: "This game is in the refrigerator."
>Jason: EIIJRTT 6J J.T +26 114
>Dan_Stock: ADEIU M3 ADIEU +25 311
>Jason: EFIIRRT 15D FIER. +15 129
#note Somehow Q puts this third; I'd have guessed somewhere around 33rd. Of course, when you're dealing in hundredths of a percent and only run it once, you can get goofy results. 
>Dan_Stock: IOP 14B POI +15 326
>Jason: AEGIORT 7E GOA +16 145
#note AGIO at J1's kind of cool, sets up a trip-trip. But as it is, I'm only concerned with spread/respectability.
>Dan_Stock: AE 15A AE +10 336
>Jason: AEEILRT 4D ATELIER. +68 213
#note I may hit 300 yet!
>Dan_Stock: AA J10 A.A +14 350
>Jason: ACCLQRY 8A CAY +33 246
#note Missed the cool plays along row 6: ACYL, LACY, RACY all making AG, COW and YAH. As I look at the score, I think "OK, 104 difference, back to respectable..."
>Dan_Stock: EFINORS A1 FORENSI. +92 442
#note ...and deservedly whacked for my mistake. One day, in a game not on ISC, I'd like to get away with a mistake, or even better, get rewarded for it like my opponents seem to. So much for keeping it respectable.
>Jason: BCLOQRW 6F BRO +31 277
#note Somehow, Q says I have a microscopic chance of winning by exchanging and keeping RW. I'd love to hear that one. Top 13 plays are exchanges.
>Dan_Stock: ITZ H1 ZIT. +39 481
>Jason: CILOQRW N2 QI +24 301
>Dan_Stock: EGKLOSS 6A .KEG +19 500
#note Q says the counterintuitive SKO(A)L or KOL(A)S at D1 net 16, while this comes out to -2.
>Jason: ACHLORW 3C CHAW +36 337
>Dan_Stock: LOSS 1A .LOSS +9 509
#note Didn't leave myself an out, so he should bleed me by playing SOL(I) at 2E and keeping the S. Hard to go through a 20-gamer without one of these. Although I got JQ; so I shouldn't complain. :) Back to mediocre at 6-6, with four of the losses games in which I lost less equity than the margin of defeat (and I'd deluded myself into thinking I'd played decently vs. Cornelis except for WINTERLY). I was getting frustrated; lunch came at a good time. Little did I know I would embark on a six-game win streak that would net almost 600 spread points and end with me leading the tournament.
>Dan_Stock:  (LOR) +6 515
