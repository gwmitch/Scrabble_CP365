>Jason: AAJNOUY G3 JAY +30 30
#note A beautiful play which I missed is YUAN at G5, setting up JO at F6 for 54 next turn if unblocked. I even tried to find a play putting the U there to set myself up and couldn't.
>Lou_Cornelis: IIII -IIII +0 20
>Jason: AGNORSU I2 GAUR +17 47
#note My probability study tells me I should "know" OURANGS. Hmph. Also missed (N)ONSUGAR. Mediocre even among the non-bingos. Again, I take a while on this play and it still comes out way wrong. I think I'll just adopt the "Leong blitzkrieg."
>Lou_Cornelis: ?ACKORT 8F cO.TRACK +66 86
#note Surprisingly, no sevens in this rack, and this is the only eight that plays. Nice find.
>Jason: BINNOSS J1 NOBS +23 70
#note Before, I might not have ditched the second S in a situation like this. I'm starting to see the value in it, although I still think the second S gets a bum rap.
>Lou_Cornelis: AGHINRT L8 .HARTING +82 168
#note Lou's rewarded for his good find the prior turn with a timely good draw.
>Jason: CEINQSV N6 QIS +46 116
#note See, but this is why I hate jettisoning the second S. Now I have no S's and there are only two to draw.

#note WTH kind of word is VERECUND?

#note Ow.

#note Plays like M(E)LTON, M(E)RLOT, M(E)NTOR, M(E)RLON are better ... I need to open the board.
>Lou_Cornelis: EHNOP 15D PHENO. +42 317
#note Yeah, I don't think this is gonna be my game.

>Jason: EEILNRT 10C ILE. +11 224
#note I liked this play. Keeps a good leave with a boatload of vowels out, creates an S- hook (I'd need to draw the S or blank to win anyway) and the possibility for eights on a board where I'm not gonna score anyway. Naturally, it's not on Q's radar.
>Lou_Cornelis: AFO 14D OAF +36 377
>Jason: EINRTWY 9E Y.W +27 251
#note I had WINTERY set up, I saw the L and I thought "even if WINTERLY is no good, he probably won't challenge 'cause he'll still be more than a bingo up after his play." Then I thought: "WINTERLY?! What, as in a manner like Winter? 'He treated his 900 opponent Winterly'? 'He treated that attractive woman Winterly'? Come now, let's not pish away spread out of frustration. I nearly flipped out when checking it after the game. *sigh* Make that three missed bingos this game.

#note Yay for pity bingos!
>Lou_Cornelis: ?EEFIPR 8A F.IP +36 456
#note Best.
>Jason: DEIT A1 TIDE +21 355
#note After the game, Lou apologized for "drawing everything," even though I got half the power tiles. At first, I'd chalked this one up to the tiles, but who knows how things change if I find OURANGS (which I should know)? Chalk it up to operator error, esp. since I lost 130+ points of equity on the three missed bingos alone. Plus, after ten rounds my opponent's average was a very low 372.8 and their high score was Easter's 434. I was due for one like this.
