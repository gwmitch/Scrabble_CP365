>Steve_Grob: AADGGHX 8G GAG +10 10
#note Close, but no HAGGADA or AGGADAH, shoulda played me DAGGA.
>Jason: ERSTTUV H7 V.TU +7 7
#note Jason: Q says this or (G)UV at I8.
>Steve_Grob: ADDHSWX 11H SHWA +28 38
>Jason: AABERST L6 ABREAST +81 88
#note BREAST is a low-prob stem, but I studied it back when I was neglecting my fours and eights because it takes almost everything. Love the anamonic, assuming I remember it correctly: "TODAY HBO SHOWS YOU BREASTS ON LIVE TV."
>Steve_Grob: ADDEIOX M9 XI +36 74
#note I was happy to find some vowels, but played this too quickly. Oxide M3 scores the same but turns over tiles and has a better leave.
>Jason: EJLLNOP M3 JELLO +33 121
#note Jason: The only play, and it took me a little while to find.
>Steve_Grob: ADDEEOT N10 DOTED +30 104
#note DOATED is a tad better, altho it opens a 3x3 line.
>Jason: DENOPTV O7 VOTED +35 156
#note Jason: Given the dearth of N's compared to T's, DOVEN in the same spot is better.
>Steve_Grob: ?AEENTW M12 AWE +28 132
#note Wanted to play WhEATEN in the O column, which Jason took. Didn't see where it played in the J column. Oops. This might be preferred, anyway, unless you've got a prop bet for missed bingos.
>Jason: FIINNOP N1 PION +23 179
#note Jason: The first equity lost of the game. But I like this play; I assume Steve is close to bingoing, probably along row 15, and since I can't block I'll set up IF at a minimum next turn.
>Steve_Grob: ?EILNTT 15G eNTITLE +78 210
>Jason: ?CFIKNS O1 IF +32 211
#note Jason: This or the Q-approved KI(P)S, which I considered but didn't play.
>Steve_Grob: AADELNU 7H .AU +11 221
#note AAL k7 scores nine more points, but Q prefers my play by a tenth of a point in valuation.
>Jason: ?CKNOSY 14D COKY +27 238
#note Jason: Q likes CONKY better. Glad I wasn't missing bingos.
>Steve_Grob: ADEGLNZ K1 GLAZED +38 259
#note Speedy player suggests my play, but Championship player prefers LAZED in the same spot, holding back NG. Easy to see why and it's not even close. Something I never even considered.
>Jason: ?EEIMNS 1E MEEtIN.S +83 321
#note Jason: This, sEEMING(S) or the cool SMEEkING. I knew neither.
>Steve_Grob: AEINPRU 14I UP +22 281
#note Jason: Looking at my rack, you'll notice what Steve blocked with that play.
>Jason: IMOOOQR 9F MO.OR +18 339
#note Jason: I almost played ROOM at 2C, but even with my hair-on-fire style I wasn't willing to be that gutsy. Ran Q twice; both times ROOM wins at an 84% rate. 
>Steve_Grob: AEHINRY 10B HAIRY +42 323
>Jason: FIINOQU 2B QUOIN +40 379
#note Jason: Very fortunate to pick the U here; without it my QI plays score little and give up a big comeback. I figured this was a no-brainer, esp. to leave one in the bag, but Q says QUINO(A), which only scores 17, is close. How's that? Must be worried about bingoing.
>Steve_Grob: ABCENNR 13G BAN +23 346
#note Speedy likes this, C-player says it's BA(I)RN for 20, and my play doesn't even show up on the list in C-player. You want to play fast, or like C-player?
>Jason: EEFIIRS B10 .EIFER +24 403
>Steve_Grob: CENRR C1 C.RER +14 360
#note Jason: CR(I)ER at D8 or (MI)NCER is one better.
>Jason: IS 3A SI. +14 417
#note Jason: Not often I open a tournament by losing 12.1 points of equity (8.0 on MOTOR). Add that to good timing and I'm off to a 1-0 start.
>Jason:  (N) +2 419
