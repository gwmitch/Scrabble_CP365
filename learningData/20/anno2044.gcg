>Beardo: EEGIIQT 8G QI +22 22
#note Sneaky: A new land speed record! Break out the party favours!
#note Beardo: Almost played this before looking at the last tile, but thought "No, if it's a U then I should play QUITE." Took 11 seconds total. And I challenge FAVOURS because I'm an ugly American. :)
>Sneaky: ?EFGNNO 9H FON +12 12
#note Sneaky: Also not acceptable, but imagined: NONGr(I)EF*
#note Beardo: Evan correctly assumed I wouldn't like FELON(I)NG*.
>Beardo: EGIIJLT J7 JI.GLE +18 40
#note Beardo: Missed JILTI(N)G; three more points and a slightly better leave.
>Sneaky: ?EEGNRS 13G GENdERS +84 96
#note Sneaky: I was considering GENERa(L)S for two less, but it provides more letters to play through.  And he would've found PILOTA(G)E had I opted for the DWS-DWS.
#note Beardo: JILTING would've cut down on his options here.
>Beardo: AEILOPT L6 EPILATO. +72 112
#note Beardo: Thanks to Evan for the open R. Held briefly.
#note Sneaky: And then released for open consumption.  I sometimes confuse the new bingos, which would explain why I thought AGENTED was Collins in a later game.
>Sneaky: EFHINRY H11 FI.RY +36 132
#note Sneaky: C'mon, ducky, stop agreeing with me so darn much!
>Beardo: ADIILPT 11D PILA. +20 132
#note Beardo: Gah! I whiffed on the D- front hook to EPILATOR with LIPID, PAID, PADI, PLAID, etc.! Not even in Q's top 15! Curses!
>Sneaky: EHNNRRU D11 .RUNE +16 148
#note Sneaky: I'm still shocked Quacky and I are seeing eye-to-eye.  Give me some bad news, please!
>Beardo: DEILMOT C13 MOD +25 157
#note Beardo: As you might guess, MOD at 5J is slightly preferred by Q.
>Sneaky: CDHMNNR 8L .NCH +27 175
#note Sneaky: I think I was laughing since I was *this close* to exchanging.
#note Beardo: This would start an interesting sequence that had both of us chuckling. P.S. You'll notice Evan hasn't come close to making a mistake yet.
>Beardo: EIILOOT K3 OLIO +10 167
#note Beardo: Gah! Chickened out on OOLITI(C)! For whatever reason, I can not wrap my mind around the fact that it's the team Hickory plays first in "Hoosiers" AND the tea! Maybe losing 12.8 points of equity and taking 7% off my win chances will teach me for good!
#note Sneaky: Yeah.  Take that.
>Sneaky: DEMNRRW 3I DR.WN +22 197
#note Sneaky: OK, now that's better.  DREW B11 scores more, but it uses my only vowel.  I can live with 11 less and an EMR leave...
>Beardo: AEEITUV 2G UVEA +16 183
#note Beardo: Gah! I missed VITAE at B10! Didn't even look at the spot! I so suck!
#note Sneaky: Aw, I don't think you suck. :P
>Sneaky: AEMOORT 1I TEAROOM +87 284
#note Sneaky:...and I can also live with an AOOT draw.  Little known personal secret: I will the tiles to get in line and sometimes they comply.
#note Beardo: Yeah, when your opponent goes from having a non-go to having three spots for the bingo ... not cool. Note that if I play VITAE, it's still an orphan.
>Beardo: AEISTXZ B10 ZAXES +93 276
#note Beardo: This nearly jolted poor Evan out of his seat. I'm pretty sure it was higher than any of my 35 bingos.
#note Sneaky: Correction: I jumped up a bit because someone left an invisible tack on my chair.  My defense team is looking for the culprit as we write.
>Sneaky: ?AAEINT C4 ENTAsIA +69 353
#note Beardo: Evan joked that he needed to end the "Idalski jinx" here because I beat him at MM, a shot at referring to my 0-4 record against him as a "mini-jinx" before the tourney. But when a guy draws like this post-bingo and comes back in round 20 to screw me out of serious $$$, screw mini-jinx, it's a full-fledged hex now! :)
#note Sneaky: At least I missed HAEmATIN for 83, since I forgot about ANTHEMIA's anagram when I was running through the alphabet.  And psst, don't tell him, but I palmed the blank when I ran to the washroom during the finale... ;)
#note Beardo: Director! Rather, unbiased director!
>Beardo: CIIKTUY 8A CU.K +42 318
#note Beardo: For the record, I'm 1-4 against Evan in tourneys, plus 0-2 in friendly games. And I won't even mention how many of the 10 blanks he's gotten in our five tournament games! (P.S. It's eight.)
#note Sneaky: And I won't mention how I racked up 12 out of the first 14 blanks in this tournament.  There, now we're even. :)
>Sneaky: BEEORVW 4A BR.VE +26 379
#note Sneaky: BREVE is not even on Quackle's original list of choices, but jumps to #2 right away in sim (and not far behind WEEVER).  Translation: I'm not that stupid.
>Beardo: DIISTUY M10 YID. +18 336
#note Beardo: And, I just noticed, both of my blanks were used on non-bingos. In five tourney games vs. Berofsky, I haven't played a blank bingo yet! How weird is that?
#note Sneaky: It's a bit weird.
#note Beardo: Haven't you heard of rhetorical questions in Canada?
>Sneaky: AAEEOSW 2N WE +24 403
#note Sneaky: I did see AWE at 2L, but completely missed the extra E for 34.  And I guess I was stuck in the mindset of not emptying the bag.
>Beardo: DHISTTU 5E THUD +20 356
#note Beardo: FWIW, Matt Robin is a terrible rack-stalker. I don't mind if you stand five feet away and take a peek, but when you're literally two feet away and staring a hole into my rack, esp. when I don't know you, you're getting smacked in the face. As he watched our endgame, Evan joked "I didn't know Scrabble was a spectator sport."
#note Sneaky: I believe there should be rules against rack-stalking. For the record, Matt didn't realize that comment was directed toward his actions. I also 'asked' Matt what tiles Bowman had on his rack late in our game.
>Sneaky: AABEGOS F4 S.AG +21 424
#note Sneaky: I recall taking way too long on this move.  I've gotta stop getting into Hoekstra Mode at times.
>Beardo: ISTT F9 TI.T +6 362
#note Beardo: If I'd seen his out, I would've played S(H)IT just for the giggles. (rim shot) The old me might've said "68.3 equity points lost in a 75-point loss, unwinnable." But if I play VITAE instead of UVEA, then he can't bingo and pick seven tiles from a rich bag. Bottom line: I didn't play at the level I needed to play at to beat a player of Evan's caliber. Simple as that.
#note Sneaky: Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Shecky Green! And I'm guessing you didn't place the 'Stop Whining' notice on the Division B board? ;)
>Sneaky: ABEO O4 OBEA. +11 435
#note Sneaky: I'm not even sure I immediately realized there was an outplay.  But I'm guessing I lucked into a lot on Day 1.  C'mon, kid, like I said: you shave the beard, you win the tournaments. ;)
#note Beardo: Except for its infancy stages at Petoskey, I've gained rating points at every tournament I've had it. It's the main reason it's still here! Good game, Evan.
>Sneaky:  (S) +2 437
