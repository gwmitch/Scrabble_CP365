>Marie: ABEKRSX -  +0 26
#note She challenged the play, thinking that because CLAIMANT was good, CLAIMER probably wasn't.
>Phil: AGIINNW 6J W.IN +15 159
#note After WIN(C)ING (How did I not see that?) WAIN is fine.
>Marie: EHTV 4H VET.H +34 60

#note For 2 points, I thought it gave less options for counterplay than ANTIGENE.
>Marie: AX F5 AX +50 110
>Phil: ADEFORS L8 OF +16 243
#note Ew. OAF/FAX is best. I think I just got bingo greedy after my start and wanted to fish.

#note Only bingo again and my second bingo bango of the game! I remember Sam telling me how he played this word in a tournament. At this point I was excited about hitting 600, something I've never done. My high game is 597 against Linda Wancel in Philadelphia this summer.

#note BIO in the same spot is better. 
>Marie: OY O14 OY +17 279
>Phil: IIIPRTU L12 TRIP +28 577
#note When I looked at this rack, I thought "oh well, no 600 for me." I decided to take the points, hoping for a good draw (out of some good unseen tiles) to reach the milestone.
>Marie: ?AAISTT 4D ..S +22 301
>Phil: IINOU 3L OI +9 586
#note I saw ION for 13 in the upper left corner. Then I saw OI and realized that the followup play of JIN/JUN would break the barrier.
