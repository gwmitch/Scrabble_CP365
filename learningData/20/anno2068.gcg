>C-Wood: BCGIKLT J7 G.CK +21 21
#note He wasn't 100% on beck.
>dacrON: EINRSVZ 7F ZIN +18 26
#note Wins the sim by a large margin (!).
>C-Wood: ABEILTT K10 ABET +18 39
#note Tough play here. I personally like BATIK...
>dacrON: EORRRSV 12H ROV.R +18 44
#note wanted to try REV(E)RSOR* so badly. ROVER is right though.
>C-Wood: BDILNTT F2 BLINT. +25 64
>dacrON: EGILRSX 13G LEX +38 82
#note Quackle likes me so far.
>C-Wood: DEEEHTU E4 HUE +23 87
#note Do you see the sweeeeeeeeet bingo here? Chris makes the best play, otherwise, here.
>dacrON: DGINRSS D1 DINGS +35 117
>C-Wood: DEEEEIT 1A DEE. +18 105
#note EERIE is cool. EEIT isn't the worst possible thing, just don't draw a bunch more Es.
>dacrON: CILRSTU F11 URIC +23 140
#note 6/6! 
>C-Wood: EEEIOPT 14I OP +20 125
#note What would you do here? I think OE in the same spot is best, but that's a tough call.
>dacrON: ILQSSTT L8 QIS +29 169
#note Complete misread here. I had him on a bingo rack, so this was supposed to force him to use the row 9 lane. Still the 2nd best play...
>C-Wood: EEEEIRT 15J EERIE +10 135
#note A bit risky for me...any merit to playing off two Es?
>dacrON: DELSTTY N13 TY. +12 181
#note (RE)LY 12H is best. I had him on E?, and with that as an inference, (RE)LY still wins. There is RR?? unseen, so it seemed worth blocking...
>C-Wood: EFHSTVY H12 ..FT +29 164
#note Wins the sim.
>dacrON: DEFILST M7 FID +29 210
#note space out, whoops.
>C-Wood: EEHOSVY 2A EH +23 187
#note I like EVES best in the N column.
>dacrON: AAAELST O13 AA +9 219
#note Oh right, only 1 A has been played up to this point. Figured I'd take out the annoying row, and save the AURIC hook for my AELST leave.
>C-Wood: EMORSVY E9 YOM +24 211
#note haha M(AA)R. YOM is not bad though. ERSV can work out here
>dacrON: AELOSTU D10 LATU +15 234
#note not a very good play. didnt even think of playing AUTO in this spot. I think fishing to AEOLST is retarded. No, I know it is.
>C-Wood: ADERSTV N6 VAS +31 242
#note best play by a landslide. It's a play like this that I Realize Chris already has a pretty good understanding of how to play scrabble
>dacrON: EOOOPSW K5 WOO +15 249
#note uh oh.
>C-Wood: ?ADERTW A1 ..WATEReD +92 334
#note Nice find! *Proud*
>dacrON: EGINOPS 10D ..P +26 275
#note So my genius play of the game. I thought there were only 6 spots, and therefore thought EPIGONS didn't fit. Ironically, I think that may have won me the game. As for my play, I was about 50/50 on P(URIC) but figured he wouldn't be in a position to challenge it. The main problem with this play is I dont have much to do if a draw an A. I should've just checked to see that EPIGONS fit...
>C-Wood: ?AAIORU J2 AURA +11 345
#note Moral of the story, Chris: Don't empty the bag in this situation. Everyone learns it at some point, I guess its best to learn during a for-fun tournament, The winning play is really cool, and I can't help but wonder if I'd have seen it. Can you find it?
>dacrON: EGILNOS B8 LEGIONS +78 353
#note didn't even think of the L(AURA) hook. a luckbox draw wins it for me. I thought I'd played this game terribly, but apparently, I played it pretty well. In any event, I'm very impressed with the level Chris is already playing at.
