#note Yes, HAB is no good, and no, there is no reason not to play 3L BOCK. I just whiffed the spot and figured I could get away with this.

#note M8 MALTOsE, D1 MAzELTO(V), 5B LOMEnTA. At the very least I simply have to see LOMENTA in this spot. My time situation wasn't superb but I easily had enough time to quickly go through the alphabet with this rack. Brutal miss.
>Kevin: A H4 .A +11 383
>Will: ?ILOTTU M11 TUT +14 420
#note No great way to block the line he just opened. Just have to hope he either doesn't hit it, or that I can bingo back through it. I'm expecting something like TEETERS, TETTERS, or TREVETS, so I feel good about ILO? through that.
>Kevin: EEGRSTT 6B GETTERS +76 459
>Will: ?DEILOT L7 TOILED +27 447
#note After GETTERS, I'm so agitated that I don't even bother to track, thinking I've surely lost unless I bingo through the G. I use all my time and go two minutes over looking for bingos that play, and of course, there are none. But if I'd bothered to look at my tracking for even a second, I'd see that Kevin has a V, only one spot to play it (11M TAV), and if I block that spot, I can easily dump a tile at a time for a large win, or just play this, then FUJIs/Os for an 11 point win.
>Kevin: V -  +0 459
>Will: ? 11K b... +6 453
#note I'm so stunned that he passed that I just slap this down without seeing the best spot to avoid losing another 10 on time. I already lose 30. This is exactly the type of loss that no Scrabble player who aspires to be any good should ever endure. If I just relax and keep my wits about me I easily win. A total mental meltdown. Final score is 459-431.
