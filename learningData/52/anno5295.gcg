>cesar: ADEIOTY 8H TODAY +26 26
#note it seems to be very close between toady, today, oy, and yo. i guess it depends on style? i'm afraid of vowels, so i'd rather take the points if i'm keeping a vowel-heavy leave. TOADY wins the sim, i'm not exactly sure why, besides it not taking an S. (-1.2)

#note conrad told me that he messed up in this play and should have kept STONE. the T by itself is not 7 points obviously but STONE may be better than ONES by more than that. quackle likes HAW better by about 2 and a half points, so it's not really that much of a mistake. 
>cesar: AEHOOSZ O6 ZOEAS +55 146
#note this is kind of a careless mistake, OOZES is probably better because of the better leave and the H hook, although I suppose I could still get burned by it. what do people think? (-4.5) I think I was trying to play quickly to minimize the probability of a challenge, because I really wasn't sure of it.

#note REFILE is just a tad better. (-0.2) I think it's just a matter of choice. actually, I kind of disagree with Quackle. maybe it's a defensive consideration.

#note i can basically end the game by finding PErMEANT, but i spent forever on this move looking for a bingo, finally settling on PENATE*. it's conrad's turn to insta-challenge a sticky-s phony. (-10.5 ... hey, that's what quackle says)
>tenniz: ENQU 2J QUE.N +68 335
#note now i'm in trouble
>cesar: ?EEMNPT J12 PET +15 375
#note quackle likes 13N PE best. it says my bingo chance is a lot higher, with the somewhat rotten tile pool it may be right. (-8)
>tenniz: ?DDINRU O13 D.. +7 342
#note quackle gives 6D ID a 44% chance of a win, with any other move losing for sure.  DYE however is a very good move against a human like me who is pissed off that he's about to blow a game. it gives him a 50% chance at UNRIMED in the C column or DRUMLIN in row 3. I could still block by playing in column E but I could always be an idiot.
>cesar: ?CEIMMN 3I MIM +25 400
#note 6C MI has the most valuation.. quackle is thinking i can bingo out with CrEMINI :) i decide to take no chances. (-16.5)
