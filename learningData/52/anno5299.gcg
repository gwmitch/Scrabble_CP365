>Evans: ADEIITX 8G XI +18 18
#note This is a cool opening rack. I opted to open short here even though ADEIT is a risky leave -- blowing up the rack with TAXIED for 32 just didn't seem worth it to me. The sim has TAXIED ahead by a point, followed by IXIA and DIXIT, then this.
>Seth: ADEIIOT 9F OIDIA +21 21
>Evans: ADDEILT 7H DILATED +66 84
#note Opting for the more defensive of the two placements, giving up four points. The sim is a dead heat, with my play ahead only slightly.
>Seth: AMP 10D MAP +23 44
>Evans: AEHNOOR 8K HONOR +40 124
#note Thought about OOH 11C a little, but 40 points is pretty juicy.
>Seth: ACEHNTT 11E ETCHANT +107 151
>Evans: AEEEJNP 12K AJEE +24 148
#note I thought really hard about playing JEE at 9B -- it keeps a solid PANE leave and sets up my A for a big TWS next turn. And there are already four A's gone, so it's not that likely that Seth has one. But AJEE is nine more points, a similarly decent leave, and stronger defense. Decided not to get cute here.
>Seth: FGLO 13K GOLF +38 189
>Evans: ENPRUVY H11 .YPER +51 199
#note Ugly leave, but 51 points is 51 points.
>Seth: IK N10 KI.. +21 210
>Evans: NNRTUVV -NRUVV +0 199
#note The only question is what to exchange. I think that given the board and pool, keeping NT makes sense. The sim prefers RT slightly -- I disagree since three R's are unseen and there's already an R to play through on this board.
>Seth: FOO G11 .OOF +25 235
>Evans: IMNNSTT M3 TINM.. +16 215
#note A desperately needed opening of this corner of the board. Maybe with a good draw, I can get back in this thing next turn.
>Seth: AEOZ L1 ZOEA +52 287
>Evans: ENNSSTU 1L .EST +39 254
#note Ugh. I hate keeping NNSU after this play, but I really don't have a choice. That Z triple lane has absolutely got to go, and this is the only way.
>Seth: EGLTU 5H GLUTE. +28 315
>Evans: BNNRSSU H1 BRUN. +27 281
#note Scoring a bit, balancing a bit, giving myself a prayer. Maybe if I get really lucky, I can bingo in the next turn or two. Not likely though.
>Seth: ?CDIINO D3 CONIDIu. +76 391
#note Ouch. Not only is that an awesome word, but it really kills bingo lanes and makes my comeback next to impossible.
>Evans: ELNQRSS 3G S.Q +23 304
#note Missing SELS 14K for 50 points. Maybe my play is better anyway, but what good is a solid leave on a board like this?
>Seth: AVV 6C V.VA +12 403
>Evans: EELNRSW 8A REW.N +24 328
#note Maybe I'm not quite 100 percent dead. Now I have two R's open for TWS bingos... I could always draw REGULARS or RENEWALS or something like that.
>Seth: ?BEGRSU A2 GRUbBE.S +61 464
#note ...or maybe he'll just bingo instead.
>Evans: AEEILSU E5 E.E. +21 349
#note Umm, no. Not even close. Nice work, self. Best is dropping the U at I14 -- I can still play ELS next turn after I block...
>Seth: ARWY 14E WA..RY +25 489
#note ...this. Nice finish.
>Seth:  (AILSU) +10 499
