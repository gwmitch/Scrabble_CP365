>Sam: ADFRU 8D FRAUD +26 26
#note After I typed in this play, I clicked on the button that said "Commit FRAUD," which is a good description of what I did when I told Appel immediately after this game that Sam and I had played a good one.
>Dave: GHJLOPT G7 J.G +21 21
>Sam: AEIU E7 U.AEI +10 36
>Dave: HLOOPTY 7G .OY +20 41
#note Clearly my brain was not attached.  I didn't like HYP or HYPO D11, and I knew HOOPY* was phony.  I didn't know PHYTOL.  But how did I miss HOOLY, HOOTY, and LOOPY?
>Sam: ETW 10C WE.T +9 45
#note Sam first laid down TEW D11, and then decided to play more aggressively.
>Dave: EHILOPT 6H HOPLITE +82 123
>Sam: CDEEINT B8 ENTICED +84 129
>Dave: ABCENNT A6 NAB +27 150
>Sam: ?EEFIRX 5B REFIXEs +89 218
>Dave: CENOOTW 4A CONE +32 182
#note I would have preferred to play the W and keep the C, but I felt like he gave me too high scoring a spot here to pass up.  Again, I wasn't thinking clearly.  Quack rightly prefers WO 4C.
>Sam: SU J5 U.S +19 237
#note He started to make a play on the O column then changed his mind.  Even without that feint, this play telegraphs a strong rack with at least one more S.
>Dave: ADEMOTW A13 MOW +31 213
#note Not crazy about keeping the O column open for him, but this play is so much stronger than anything else I have.
>Sam: KU C2 KU.. +16 253
>Dave: ADEMNOT N5 N.MATODE +63 276
#note I wrote down ADEIMNOT and completely did not recognize that there was a bingo in it!  I am clearly very rusty.  On the bright side, I'm taking away O column bingos...
>Sam: EENRSSV L6 .NVERSES +80 333
#note ...so of course his bingo is to the I.  LULZ!
>Dave: ABEHIOT O7 OBI +33 309
#note Ooh, a good move for a change.  Keeps the H for a big play at O12, or maybe O1-5.
>Sam: IQ 11J QI. +24 357
>Dave: ?AEHNRT O12 HART +42 351
#note Taking a 42 point play and keeping the blank seemed better than bingoing, though one could make the case that the board might get too crowded for bingos soon.  HANT is the obvious play, but that's the case N and there are two R's left to draw.
>Sam: LOV 15L VOL. +11 368
>Dave: ?AAAENT 13E ANATAsE. +59 410
#note I first laid down ANApAEST, but when I saw the high probability of getting hit with ZAGS, ZAPS, or IZARS, I changed my tune.  Good thing I did, as he had at least two of those plays.
>Sam: GR I12 G.R +4 372
>Dave: ADIILLY 14F AI +10 420
#note LULZ again.  My attempt to block and give myself two outs just increased the score of his GROSZ play.  AIR was the right way to do this.  At least I still win.
>Sam: GIOPRSZ 15D ZIPS +33 405
#note Not only did Sam miss his big play, he complimented me on my boneheaded play.
>Dave: DILLY 4I IDYLL +25 445
#note Sam challenged, giving me a moment of terror that I had misremembered DUPS.
>Dave:  (GOR) +8 453
