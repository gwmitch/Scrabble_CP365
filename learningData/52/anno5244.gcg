#note Quackle likes CUD by a fair margin. Can't say I agree.

#note Best on score (except for 3x3-opening plays for 1 more point).

#note I was disappointed that TITLARKS got blocked, but this seemed like a fine alternative. Somehow I never saw TILAK, much less STIRK 5I.

>Bing: BEIMOSY 3F SYMBIO.E +94 221
#note The wide open style pays a dividend.

#note Very glad this didn't get blocked.

#note Kind of a self-describing play, but I couldn't see any other good options.

>Bing: EGGNPTU 4A NUGGET +25 427
#note I had been planning on NUGGET/ST#, so when it still fit I put it down quickly (Pakorn was down to his last minute at this point). But I could have played GETUP/WISP, which might be better, not least because it doesn't give Pakorn the easy ZEIN play and he would need to think. Of course, he could have had an easy play like ZINES underneath GETUP.

>Bing: LNNOPRS N5 P.RLS +15 442
#note Endgame blunder! I have no idea why, but I was sure I had seen REARINGS*. Practically all -INGS words are good in CSW, but not this one. Incredibly, I saw a different winning sequence (starting with NURL B3), and had plenty of time left, but still played the phoney. If Pakorn hadn't been down to his final seconds, he surely would have challenged. Kids, don't try this at home. Please.
