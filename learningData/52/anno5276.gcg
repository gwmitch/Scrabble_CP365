>wall-e: BEMOORW -BEMO +0 0
>moh: AORSSTZ 8G ZA +22 22
#note Tough opener, I thought. Quackle's sim suggests that TZAR is the best play, but I didn't like breaking up some pretty promising bingo tiles. Quackle says that ZA and ZAS are essentially tied.
>wall-e: EIINO G4 IONI.E +17 17
>moh: LORSSTX 10G SOX +26 48
#note Didn't think of the LIONIZE hook! 3G LOX is best. Or SOX/ZAX. But not my play. Definitely not my play.
>wall-e: AE 9I AE +13 30
>moh: DLRRSTV 4F V.RL +8 56
#note T(ZA)R/R(AX) is an interesting option, pretty much even with V(I)RL.
>wall-e: ?EEEHIT I9 ..E +10 40
>moh: BDIQRST 12I DRIB +26 82
#note J2 QIS 40 is probably best, athough I was enamored by the big setup I was creating if I draw an A (QAT 11K). DRIB sims just behind QIS.
>wall-e: AEY H1 YEA. +21 61
>moh: EGQSTTU K10 QU.T +26 108
#note Wow, this just wasn't my game. M9 QUEST 56 is clearly best.
>wall-e: EINPS 14J PENIS +40 101
>moh: AAEGPST 6B PAGEA.TS +69 177
#note The only bingo.
>wall-e: IJKO 15G KOJI +49 150
>moh: ACEELMM 13M MEM +24 201
#note MEM is best.
>wall-e: ?EFLOUW 1A WOEFULl. +110 260
#note Ouch! Much better than B5 U(P)FLOWEd.
>moh: AACEEHL 7I HEAL +20 221
#note This play confirms what we already thought: I just wasn't making good decisions this game. Ugh. There are a dozen better plays.
>wall-e: IOV L4 VIO. +14 274
>moh: ACCEGNR 8K NACRE +35 256
#note Best.
>wall-e: DR 5K R.D +8 282
>moh: BCEGGNT C3 BEG.T +18 274
#note Easily best, but I don't like my chances after Wally's two-tile dump.
>wall-e: ?ADIORR E5 R.ORDAIn +82 364
#note That should do it.
>moh: CEGHNOU D9 ENOUGH +29 303
#note Certainly my chances are slim, but maybe, just maybe, I draw a miracle bingo out of the bag. ENOUGH is best.
