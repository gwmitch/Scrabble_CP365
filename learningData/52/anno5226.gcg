#note This is phony. I considered challenging, but my rack was telling me I could probably leave it on and still win.
>Matthew: ?CEHIRS 2I HERoICS +88 441
#note This and 4I HERoICS are the only bingoes. I strongly considered passing the bingo up, fearing an outbingo from David could win it for him. Quackle says bingoing is a mistake, giving me a 76.12% chance to win, while 8L ECHE wins 88.85%. Tsk. Poor decision making.
