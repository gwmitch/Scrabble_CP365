>Sam: ?KLLMOQ 9F MOLL +23 49
#note Had I known KILOMOLE I probably would have gone with QI. Thought about trading--Quackle likes playing through, and I'm never sure in these situations so I just went with MOLL.

#note Didn't like spending my blank and keeping this leave, but it has to be worth it.

#note Yet another tough decision where I elected to play through and Quackle liked it.

>Sam: AEGKMRT 10I MA.K +19 180
#note KA E10 might be slightly better, but it's not so strong, and the C column is a pretty weak line anyway. Don't mind MACK.

>Sam: GLNOPRS A12 GL.. +8 216
#note SLOP 15L is simming best, followed by LOPS M7, then POLS M7 and my play of GLAD. I really don't like SLOP--it basically throws away my one advantage here just for points, and if I don't draw the S or blank I might get into trouble quickly. LOPS is a little more interesting leaving the G hook out there, but I liked my play to hold onto the S with two big spots for it.

>Sam: ?IILNOV M4 VIOLINs +73 370
#note For some reason I convinced myself it was worth it to sacrifice the points. Quackle doesn't think so, and I'm pretty sure I was wrong.

>Sam: DEITUWX O5 TEW +16 386
#note Erm okay Sam. I was really worried about the S, obviously. Don't think this craziness was necessary though. Just playing DUIT is probably best, and it sets up the X--it wins the sim even giving Dannene a partial rack of ERS.

>Dannene_Drummond: AEEIRRR 4G REARRI.E +74 391
#note I was worried Dannene could win if I lost a challenge, so I let this go. Sigh. Should have just worked out the endgame and realize I win no matter what. Cost myself tons of spread here.
