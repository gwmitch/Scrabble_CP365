#note nothing good to open the board, so i'm just trying to wait it out a little with a decent rack, hoping he does something that i can respond to with a bingo. potentially too focused on leave when the score is this close.  GEY 3a looks good.

#note didn't spend enough time on this.  OMELETTE didn't seem like enough to win looking at the bag, but if i had seen the 3x3 in ?EELMORT, of course i would have played it. this looks like the best play if you aren't smart enough to know your gene replication terminology and/or high prob eights.
>petez: ADEHK 15F KHEDA +51 435
#note not sure why he played it here instead of through the 3x3 lane, but it worked out either way.
