>Bing: ELNOTUU -OULU +0 0
#note Oddly enough, this exchange slightly outsims playing the same tiles for 9 points (VOULU#, which I missed).

>Bing: ?AAEGUV J2 VAGUE +25 159
#note I missed the critical hook, ESSE#. Since I'm down by so much, it might be better to leave it this turn, but it never occurred to me.
>Pakorn: ABELORR L1 LABORER +77 360
>Bing: ?AAGNPP 11E PAGAN +32 191
#note Missed APPAyING#, and inadvertently killed the best bingo line (ESSE#). Not the way to win.
>Pakorn: Q 10J Q. +31 391
>Bing: ?AEEPSW 10F PAW +34 225
#note Missed the cute AWE 13M.
>Pakorn: LOY 13L LOY +32 423
>Bing: ?EEESYZ 9C ZEES +28 253
#note Desperately trying to open something. I could have just played EYE M2, hoping for a Z play at 15N next turn.

>Bing: ?DEEIJO 3B JOE +22 316
#note Trying to salvage some spread with this setup, but it's probably better to just take the points with JEDI#. (As it turns out, that would given me a final rack of IONISE?, and Pakorn might have had to spend another overtime minute finding a block.)
