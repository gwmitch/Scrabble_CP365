>jasonkb: ?AGITTY E7 ..TTY +20 48
#note (BI)TTY has highest static evaluation and... one of the worst sim results. Quackle likes GAITT# 6F which I considered but didn't consider actually choosing. The details of the sim are intriguing (for example the "rack leftover value" is 6 points higher for GAITT# than BITTY).

>jasonkb: EHINNOX 4B HEX +46 401
#note I considered EXON but... was scared of a big play making OXO and me no longer having an O. Quackle thinks EXON wins 41% and HEX 36%.
>Nigel_Richards: ACFN L8 F.ANC +28 424
>jasonkb: GINNOOP 5A GIPON +36 437
#note After the game, I kicked myself, thinking that PO# F14 might have worked out better, but Quackle doesn't indicate that wins any more games. Had I played PO# Nigel would have played ALAAP# D11 and I would be dead no matter which two of three tiles I draw. I imagine most endgames work out like that after PO# -- Nigel makes a long word and goes out in two anyway even tho there's one in the bag. Or if he has clunky letters and an O, makes a play making OXO.
>Nigel_Richards: AAADELP F10 AAL +14 438
#note He is very good at endgame.
>jasonkb: MNOOV 6A OM +27 464
#note Best is OMOV#/FRANCO# 13L.
>Nigel_Richards: ADEP F14 PE +22 460
>jasonkb: NOV L2 ..V +12 476
#note I saw his best outplay but it didn't occur to me to stop it =P  Best is NO 13K making FRANCO#, which I didn't know (it doesn't take S!) or (L)O(GO)N 12F.
