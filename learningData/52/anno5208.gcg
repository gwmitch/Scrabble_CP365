>Dave: BIILNOT 8D BLINI +20 20
#note Maybe BIOTIN or BIONT.  The important thing is to play long with this rack.  There's no leave that's powerful enough to make it worth playing a three or four letter word here.

>Dave: ELNNOTX E10 NEXT +24 44
#note I didn't see my high scoring play of ANNEX, but that gives up big K column plays hooking ANNEXE.  This play also exposes the X, but it's a bit safer defensively for exactly the reason you'll see in the game.
>Kwak: EEGHIPS D11 PEE +34 44
#note Yeah, he can go parallel and score off the X, but two can play at this game...

#note I'm not going to draw into a bingo next turn, unless he fortuitously opens a spot for me, but this is still better than SURD/SILEX right away on the basis that I'm unlikely to get anything better for the Z.  If the board and my leave were conducive to bigger Z plays, then one could make the case for holding onto it.

>Dave: DDLORSU H1 SLO.D +39 253
#note Objectively this is the best play, but if there's anyone you'd want to consider playing SUDD/SILEX against instead of this, it's Quackle.  But you know me; I don't like to play scared...

>Dave: ACIRRTU M12 .UR +12 351
#note Although this does give him a nice lane on row 15, with the strong pool to draw into and several bingo lanes, it makes sense to play aggressively.

>Dave: ACHIRST A12 SITH +37 388
#note Sigh.  I spent a lot of time on this play, stared at the nine letter alphagram through ER, and still missed my bingo.

#note It's often a tricky question whether to play long and empty the bag or prolong the game with a short play in these situations.  Two key questions to ask yourself are (1) does he need a bingo to beat me? and (2) can I win even if he bingos?  If the answer to (1) is yes and (2) is no, your best bet is usually going to be to empty the bag as fast as possible regardless of how many tiles you keep.  The idea is to give him as few possible turns to hit the bingo.  It really doesn't matter that he'll get a bunch of extra points from my rack when he does bingo, because in the cases where I leave a few tiles in the bag, he'll hit his bingo and go out faster than me anyway.  My play also has the advantage of closing out several of the bingo lines.
