#note My only other consideration was AZUKI E8, but I liked setting up my F for 8L. The two plays sim very closely, with my play slightly ahead after 5,000 iterations.

>Sam: EEEIORT 4K .OE +12 136
#note This play took me a decent amount of time. OE L3 sims best, with RETIE 5A, FOE, and FEE 4K all about two points back and TOE 7C a point behind those. OE seemed like a pretty weak play for me, giving him a nice scoring spot that he can often use without giving me another spot in that corner. FOE didn't really accomplish much, but it kept a nice leave and didn't give him the scoring options that OE and RETIE opened up. RETIE at least has the advantage of somewhat obstructing out the G(RANTING) hook. I really don't mind FOE, though.
>Mitchell_Brook: GNOW A6 GOWN +34 127
>Sam: BEEEIRT 9C BEE +15 151
#note Quackle rates BEE and BEET 5C as best, about 3-3.5 points better than my play. Maybe I overvalued the strength of the 4D spot those plays opened up, but I could see too many games unfolding where Mitch played for big points up there and I had no bingo spot or had to bingo for small points into the triple lane. I preferred making him open up a spot and not giving him many scoring options. Not sure what's better here.

#note VAUNT seems clearly better.
>Mitchell_Brook: IORT 12A ROTI +20 292
>Sam: EHLNSSU 10F HUN +27 302
#note Some other plays that Quackle likes such as SLUSH and SLUE 13C don't make any sense to me. After a bit of thinking HUN seemed like the obvious choice. Quackle likes SLUSH a good amount but it seems risky with the Y out, and it also leaves a lot at the bag's mercy.

#note Stupidly missed JEU with my time ticking down, and thought JOT/JET were his only J plays. BED 4D is best.
