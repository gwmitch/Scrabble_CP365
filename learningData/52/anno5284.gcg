#note All turns simmed >250 iterations on 2 plies.

>Matthew: EEGINOT 8E EGE.TION +60 138
#note So it's going to be one of those games.
>Jeremy: ?ADFLMU J5 FLU.DrAM +65 159
#note Wasn't sure on E6 Dr(E)AMFUL -11.7, but I would have played it if I didn't find this.  Contest for high P/A words today, I was disappointed I couldn't fit MUDFLAp anywhere.
>Matthew: CENNOOR 5J .ON +12 150
#note 11E CORON(A)E -15.0
>Jeremy: EENTXYZ K10 EX +37 196

#note 1L ENOW -3.9
>Jeremy: EGNTUYZ 4K YUTZ +41 237
>Matthew: ACENORT E1 CAROTEN. +70 246
#note Quackle likes the E3 CAROT(E)NE positioning leaving a risky S hook.  I think most players would play it this way.  -1.7
>Jeremy: AEEGNQR L10 GENERA +29 266
#note Close between K1 Q(I) for 11 and a good leave, and L10 GENERA for 29 but Q stuck.  Quack likes my play by a point, but I couldn't have gone either way depending on the day of the week.  The deciding factor was tile turnover to get to the second blank.
>Matthew: HIILTTU 15G THULI. +27 273
#note 12D LITHIU(M) -0.9.  15G LITHI(A) is also better by 0.2 which Matthew wishes he would have played after this happened.
>Jeremy: ABDEIIQ 14F QI +33 299
>Matthew: ABGINOT 1A BONA.I +33 306
#note D2 BOTA -0.5.  A lot of plays are close here.  I put BONACI on hold because I couldn't remember it in my sixes even though I knew BONACIS was good.  I didn't challenge though.
>Jeremy: AABDEIL D3 ABA +22 321
#note D3 ABIDE -15.2.  Geez, it didn't seem that bad.  I thought keeping back the L and D for ammo at 11M would be a good idea while staying somewhat bingo prone.
>Matthew: DGIIOPT 3C P..TI.D +36 342
#note Awesome find by Matthew.
>Jeremy: ADEILOR M11 LODE +31 352
#note We won't tell anyone I might have missed DARIOLE if it played.  This bingo should be a slam dunk but I seem to have lost track of it.  -0.9 F6 DO(G).  A lot of close plays near the top of the list.  I think it's crazy not jumping on those points and gambling on a bingo.
>Matthew: GIORSSY 13G GOYS +34 376
#note Best, barely beating H10 GOYIS(H).
>Jeremy: AAEHIJR F6 HE.IRA +35 387
#note My thinking was to bank 12H JAM for next turn, and try to scoop the blank with tile turnover.  Switching to a Many ply sim now, my play is 35.58% to win.  Best is 12H JA(M) at 47.88% to win.  Best valuation was 2A AHI at 22.7 to my 17.0.  -5.7  Can someone explain why I should play JAM?
>Matthew: CEIIMRS 12A CRIMES +37 413
#note Many Ply says E10 EMIC at 73.23% to win and a valuation of 23.8.  CRIMES is in 3rd place at 57.58% to win, and a valuation of 1.4. -22.4
>Jeremy: ?AFJRUW B10 JA.FUl +62 449
#note 13C FUR wins by 15 blocking Matthew's out of KA(M)I.  This works too, but it only wins by 2 and brings on a recount.
>Matthew: AIK 15A I.KA +24 437
