>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: DEEHSSU 8G HUED +16 16
#note well i managed not to screw up this move
>Rebecca_Slivka: FGO 7I FOG +23 23
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: BEISSVW 7C WIVES +22 38
#note Rebecca: "so why didnt you play this at L3"
xp: "uh ..."
>Rebecca_Slivka: CHT I7 ..TCH +14 37
#note fortunately she is vowel challenged at the moment and cant take advantage of my stupid play
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: ABDEPSS 8A ABED +37 75
#note best not leave that open
>Rebecca_Slivka: AELTX H11 EXALT +65 102
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: AEOPRST L1 PROTEAS +82 157
#note i played this instead of ESPARTO L6 because it scores more, except for the fact that it doesnt score more because i didnt do the math right. math is hard.
>Rebecca_Slivka: ?GINOPS 1H ShOP.ING +158 260
#note yeah, i deserved that. the insta 3x3. SlOPPING would be more appropriate, given how i am playing
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: EIMNORW 13H .IRWOMEN +78 235
#note she 3x3'd before i had even looked at my tiles. i turn them over and think "hey, i can play (A)IRWOMEN at 13H!" without a) even looking for (T)IMEWORN for 101 or b) even noticing the A at 8A to play it for 92! what the hell is wrong with me?
>Rebecca_Slivka: AACEQUV N9 AQUA. +34 294
#note Rebecca debated about this move a long time. it sims way better than any other choices, VAW K11 being 2nd best.
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: ABEINST O3 BANTIES +82 317
#note who needs to play well when you can just be a luckbag? i mean, uh, I'm practicing good rack management. yeah, thats it ...
>Rebecca_Slivka: CELV L11 CL.VE +22 316
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: AIIJORY K3 JAY +47 364
#note really cannot screw this play up, even if the leave sucks
>Rebecca_Slivka: DIMT 15K D.MIT +24 340
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: AEIIORR 15E RIO. +4 368
#note this move sims about 845th best. i could hear Quackle laughing at me. i have no idea why i made this play.
>Rebecca_Slivka: NU H1 .UN +3 343
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: ?AEFIRZ 6B ZA +37 405
#note 3 pretty good plays to choose from that are close ? FA 6F, ZA 6B, FRIEZE F2 for 46 ... i set up FRIEZe on my rack at one point but didnt bother to look for an open E on the board! this is how i roll - spaz and get bailed out by good tiles in lieu of any actual good play. fortunately, Rebecca is drawing seaweed at the moment.
>Rebecca_Slivka: EKL 14D LEK +35 378
#note gee, maybe i should not have given her a big spot for the K. she played SUN to setup another K spot, in fact, since her tiles are shit at this point
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: ?EEFIRU G11 FE +23 428
#note the duck likes fishing with JOE here, or FEU for 19 at N4. REFIX at 12D came to mind also. this isnt that terrible of a play, i dont think
>Rebecca_Slivka: NO G2 NO +8 386
#note her tiles are garbage at this point
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: ?EGILRU 4A LIGUREs +68 496
#note I R LUCKPANTS! pretty much any bingo will work at this point, so i just threw down the 1st bingo i saw
>Rebecca_Slivka: ADINOTY A1 DAI.Y +27 413
>Chris_Patrick_Morgan: EIORR 9A ROE +18 514
#note maybe the lousiest 514 game i've ever played, but it was club, and club is supposed to be fun, and Rebecca and i were laughing throughout
>Rebecca_Slivka: NOT E11 TON.. +10 423
#note a very fun game to play
>Rebecca_Slivka:  (IR) +4 427
