>Kapsalon: ACDEENU I1 .ACE +20 374
#note 6H NEC(K)? If we're going for the Q, the A could be helpful, and even so, the A is helpful on ths board. That said, (T)ACE seems to be the best balance of all factors involved here.
>Shark: ILLNORY A11 ORL.N +18 384
#note LI(O)N versus ORL(O)N. LORY leave versus ILY. The O is a much friendlier tile here, but the I is very helpful as Q insurance. If we draw the Q after LI(O)N, we're in huge trouble, but if we don't draw an E after ORL(O)N, we're also in some sort of trouble. LORY seems to be a better leave so long as we don't draw the Q (77% of the time). But perhaps the upsides of the LORY leave don't outweight the downsides, as opposed to ILY...?
>Kapsalon: DEELNTU N5 ELUTED +16 390
#note Debate away! The best we came up with was to go for an out next turn. The main other options were those on the F column. Plays like LUTE and INDULT block most of the opponent's good Q plays (QUIRK, QUICK, QUIRKY), forcing them to play the Q on line A. However, looking at a lot of these situations revealed a pretty bleak picture even after blocking. See anything better?
