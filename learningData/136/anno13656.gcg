#note (P)REBINDS might have induced her into a challenge if I actually knew the word was good.
>Noella_Ward: MO H1 MO +26 38
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADORWW 9C DRAW +27 128
#note Just play WAW.
>Noella_Ward: EIR 8A IRE +12 50
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DIMNOY J2 OY +19 147
#note MY(R)mIDON holy poop. Seems like in this tourny I drew early blanks and then proceeded to whittle away my clock deciding how to fish.
>Noella_Ward: EHNS 10C HENS +39 89
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DDIMNT 5E MIND.D +20 167
#note I'm pretty sure this is the rack - no bingos. MIDD(E)N I didn't know.

>Matthew_Larocque: ?GHITTW A6 WH.TTInG +64 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GHITTW --  -64 167
#note I really take a big crap here and don't even notice the W hook on HENS, or the valid bingos.
>Noella_Ward: EINQU C2 QU.IE +28 129
>Noella_Ward: EINQU --  -28 101
#note Noella trying to help me out.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GHITTW B2 WH.T +20 187
#note I block her Q play but WIGHT for 59 is too wicked, and TW(I)lIGHT/TW(I)nIGHT aren't bingos you come across every day.
>Noella_Ward: EINQU D9 ..QUIN +30 131
#note Ruh roh.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEFGIT C13 TEG +14 201
#note I might have found this bingo if I wasn't distracted! I attempted to play it in a certain popular word game on facebook and it was rejected. Really now. That's just lame.
>Noella_Ward: AET A1 TAE +19 150
#note Still no s...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEFIL B14 FA +25 226
#note I could play FA(G) just to end the suspense, but it's the final game so you know I need to do some choking. Amazingly there are 2 nines though TI here, and one playable seven that I was not familiar with. Finally, an eight through the I also plays.
>Noella_Ward: IIIIOOO -IIIIOOO +0 150
#note Maybe I'll be ok afterall.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEFILS 15A F..S +44 270
>Noella_Ward: EORV 9H OVER +14 164
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEEIL K7 AE.IC +14 284
#note Shockingly there are no bingos, and this isn't even a word! Spectacularly bad.

>Noella_Ward: AGUZ N6 GAUZ. +22 215
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIILPR 6C ICE +11 388
#note I... I don't know. I have nothing good to say. I was fishing for PA/ZA? Yeah something like that. Should have played PI M3 like I wanted to.
>Noella_Ward: AOV M10 .OVA +14 229
>Matthew_Larocque: ILPRTX L13 PIX +24 412
#note Wrong.
>Noella_Ward: ?ABU 15H BeAU. +39 268
#note Coughed up a little too much spread there I think, but I didn't go overtime! That's impressive for me against Noella who throws down tiles like lightning bolts.
>Noella_Ward:  (LRT) +6 274
#note Fairly good tournament, winning is tough when Eric Tran is in the field. Had a chance at second place if I challenge *ABBATIS in my game against Juraj. Managed to reclaim that coveted 1600 that I don't even deserve *shrugs* time to study!
