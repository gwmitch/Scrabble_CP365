#note Didn't want to leave the easy points on the L column open, but this might not be worth it. I missed the best play LINGULA, which does everything I wanted to do here.

#note Wow, this is edged out in the sim but J5 OP, which I didn't consider at all. The leave bingos a decent amount of the time, but it also kills the easy points there. Interesting. But ISBA is fine too.

#note It sucks because I've actually played a decent game up until here. But talking myself out of MUCHO was a boneheaded move that could have cost me the game. I thought it was Collins, because I didn't think Adam would have set it up. REDOX there seals the deal on this game. I was just so worried about losing my turn.
