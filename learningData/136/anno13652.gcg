>Avery_Mojica: AIKLNOU 8G KUNA +16 16
#note I don't like KAOLIN because of the E hook.
>Chuck_Riordan: BDGINOS I6 BO.DINGS +66 66
#note I3 placement 2 more points, but this is more defensive for the triples.
>Avery_Mojica: EEIILNO 11G LI.IN +10 26
#note This sucks. INDIE 9G better.
>Chuck_Riordan: ABELNOT 13B NOTABLE. +72 138
#note Eek!
>Avery_Mojica: EFIIOOV -FOOIVIE +0 26
#note Alright, I'll exchange already!
>Chuck_Riordan: COW 14A COW +25 163
>Avery_Mojica: DDEHSTV -DHV +0 26
#note Relatively high on the sim actually. I do not need consonats at this point. But I'm done for with this game. I think...
>Chuck_Riordan: FU 6G FU. +8 171
>Avery_Mojica: DEERSTV 12C VET +27 53
#note Best. Not bad. At least I'm scoring now!
>Chuck_Riordan: ?AEINPT 15C sPINATE +92 263
#note Nice plays. I'm done for. I think...
>Avery_Mojica: ADEGRSW 11D WE +22 75
#note I think I virtually gave up at this rate. I would have found a better play. I shouldn't do that though. Funnily enough, RED(LININ)G is acceptable for 31. lol
>Chuck_Riordan: EGIV 5D GIVE +21 284
#note L11 Placement better, but he probably has an O.
>Avery_Mojica: ADGNRSX 10H S.X +53 128
#note I just need to start scoring.
>Chuck_Riordan: HU D4 U.H +14 298
#note Sounds like how my game is going, huh?
>Avery_Mojica: ADEGNRS 4G DANGERS +77 205
#note Well I didn't see the LINING area either. This is second best.
>Chuck_Riordan: DFMR K2 FR.MD +22 320
>Avery_Mojica: ?EEOOTZ H1 ZOE. +39 244
#note Keeping an O for a possible OGIVE hook bingo
>Chuck_Riordan: AAIR C6 ARIA +11 331
>Avery_Mojica: ?AEOORT M3 O.TEOlAR +68 312
#note Now, I did find SOrORATE, but not TEAROOm. I got this confused with OSTIOLAR. He actually complimented me on this, and didn't even hold it. I'm back into this after a 210 point deficit.
>Chuck_Riordan: IQ N2 QI +24 355
>Avery_Mojica: AEIMORU O1 MI +23 335
#note With a consonant heavy pool, this shouldn't be too bad. Isn't my logic great?
>Chuck_Riordan: AYY B4 YAY +34 389
#note Yay indeed.
>Avery_Mojica: ACEEORU 8L C.UE +24 359
#note Best
>Chuck_Riordan: JT O7 J.T +10 399
>Avery_Mojica: ADELOPR A5 PAROLED +94 453
#note !!!! A2 LEOPARD is even better. I'm not complaining though.
>Chuck_Riordan: EHLORST L8 .HOSE +33 432
>Avery_Mojica: EI 5M .IE +3 456
#note Did this really just happen? I won after a 210 point deficit? Either way, great game to Chuck.
>Avery_Mojica:  (RTL) +6 462
