>Quackle: EEEIIIN -EEIII +0 0
>Bill: EGHLRSU H4 HUGER +26 26
#note LEUGH# - to laugh (to express mirth by explosive inarticulate sounds). This helpfully clarifies the OWL definition for laugh (to express emotion, typically mirth, by a series of inarticulate sounds), which failed to exclude wordless singing and yodeling.
>Quackle: ?AEKNSX G3 KEX +33 33
>Bill: EILOSTV 6H .OV +15 41
#note OLIVETS# (a button shaped like an olive)... dang, I should be seeing that by now.
>Quackle: ?AADNSU K6 SAUNAeD +72 105
>Bill: EHILMST J10 HM +31 72
#note This sims best though HUMLIE# (a hornless cow) and HUMITE# (a particular impurity in marble) score 42 and might be worth it since the board is pretty lousy.
>Quackle: CEFLOST I6 .F +18 123
>Bill: EEILOST L9 ESTOILE +84 156
#note ESTOILE# - in heraldry, a star with wavy points. The heraldry words are one of my favorite categories.
>Quackle: CELOQST -Q +0 123
#note I definitely lucked out with Quackle drawing the Q on a one tile fish when I just put an E in a triple lane. In fact, I REALLY lucked out...
>Bill: ACILNPT 15H PLAN.TIC +158 314
#note PLANETIC# - pertaining to a planet or planets. Takes an A front hook (also Collins-only) and anagrams to PECTINAL#. Sorry, but any dictionary that doesn't include planetic is rubbish.
>Quackle: CEELOST 8A SELECTO. +83 206
>Bill: AELMOPU A1 AMPOULE. +89 403
#note Not much strategy this game, just some cool plays.
>Quackle: DFIINRY 2A .INIFY +44 250
>Bill: AABIINR 1F BANI +25 428
#note Oh jeez, BRAINIAC! Just one of those games where almost every rack is a bingo rack. I found most of them, but this and OLIVETS eluded me.
>Quackle: ABDEJRW 14J JE.AB +97 347
#note It's never easy with Quackle. Yes, as you suspected JELAB# is yet another spelling of THAT WORD. All told, there are (at least) fourteen in CSW.
>Bill: AAEIIRT E2 .AIR +14 442
#note I kinda stand behind this play. I noticed that AEI, and vowels in general, were getting scarce, so I wanted to keep one of each and I didn't mind losing the R since there are four unseen. I still would've played Quackle's choice of G13 AIA, but I didn't know APLANETIC (I'll allow dictionaries without aplanetic to exist in peace).
>Quackle: DRRTTWW G7 T.WT +19 366
>Bill: AEEIORT 2H ETAERIO +72 514
#note ETAERIO# - an aggregated fruit like a blackberry. Probably my first game with three CSW bingos.
>Quackle: DEIRRWY M1 W.RY +20 386
>Bill: ?AGOORV D6 OV.RGOAd +72 586
#note Interestingly VORAGO# (a gulf) is a word, and TOWT does take an S, but OVERGOAD is the only bingo because VORAGO only pluralizes -ES.
>Quackle: DEIQRSZ C12 ZED +39 425
>Bill: DEINNOU D6 ........ED +19 605
#note I'll be good for once and play defense as opposed to just running up the score at the expense of spread. This is best.
>Quackle: DGIQRS 4D Q. +22 447
>Bill: INNOU F10 UNION +13 618
#note Again, I figured I'd be honorable and not wring out a few extra points by letting Quackle get IDS for 29. However, this actually IS my best option for personal score, because Quackle can go out - GIRDS or GRIDS forming NED# (a young hooligan) and HASS# (an oatmeal pudding made with sheep's gullet). NED, as you can imagine, is a pretty basic CSW word, but I'd never seen HASS.
