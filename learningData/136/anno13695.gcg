>Gunther_Jacobi: CEHIOST 8H OH +10 10
#note A few ways of going about this. Q likes exchanging O-34.9 Q's second choice is ETHIC 8H-33.1...OH 8H-32.1...ECHOISM is good, not ECHOIST...although I considered the phoney.
>Peter_Huszagh: EGO J6 EGO +12 12
#note This would be much better at 7G for two reasons: its safer and scores three more points.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?CEISTX 5E CoEXIST +115 125
>Peter_Huszagh: AE H4 A.E +11 23
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEGIOTZ F4 O.ZE +32 157
#note This scores as well as 4K AZOTE without opening column O. Although OOZE has defensive drawbacks as well.
>Peter_Huszagh: AEGILRR 9B GLARIER +62 85
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEINOT E7 AE.ATION +68 225

>Peter_Huszagh: ANSTY L3 NASTY +32 135
#note Maybe just play off the Y? 
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADFJLMN M2 JAM +32 355
#note B6 FL(AG)MAN 27 is pretty raw, and only 1.1 back.
>Peter_Huszagh: IMOTV N1 VOMIT +48 183
>Gunther_Jacobi: DFLLNRT 12C FR.LL +16 371
#note Airballed D(A)FT 10D 34.

>Peter_Huszagh: ADDEI O4 AIDED +33 216
>Gunther_Jacobi: BDNPTUV 10H BUNDT +15 386
#note All plays seem bad here, yet not quite poor enough to exchange. I saw Q's first choice PUB, but went for more turnover. 4.6 back.
>Peter_Huszagh: EEIOOUU -EIOOUU +0 216
#note With such a strikingly heavy pool of consonants, getting hit with seven vowels is pretty unbelievable. Crazy.
>Gunther_Jacobi: GLNOPRV G1 GLOV. +15 401
#note Since Peter said he exchange 6 vowels, I went for this play with more confidence than in any other scenario. Although Q likes PROV(E) better. 1.6 back.

>Peter_Huszagh: IO J1 .OI +9 252
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEINPRU K10 .UP +12 448
#note Q likes (T)URNIP L10. I considered that, but if he picked the Q, I don't want him to dump it for 31.

>Gunther_Jacobi: ADENNRS O12 E.N +4 470
#note Q likes DARNE(L)S, which I was inclined to play first...Q doesn't see E(R)N until I activate the sim, the prefers it over DARNELS by 4.0 after +2600 iterations.
