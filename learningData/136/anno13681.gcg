#note Immediately saw ERINGOS g15, possible SIGNORE f15 (not sure about LATI)... However the real question, is not judging play 100% sure a word or try higher with risk getting challenged of... Was a bingo a right play now? With 5 unseen tile, poisonous  Q, and clunky medium tile V and  and 100 points behind, play bingo now may result getting bad combination and cannot score well in next turn... instead, try make 1 spot for bingo..

Interestingly, Quackle never mentioned ERG was a right play... After repeated many times, the reason was eventhough another O is still bag, Fadlan still have momentum to keep his lead, no matter how bad his rack... if Fadlan has taken O, it will be suicidal set-up. However since he immedately challenged OORIER, it was a obvious sign that O still in bag

Quackle suggestion, was not play a bingo, but play ERGO, forget about set-up for 21 crucial points, leave 2 letters in bag and forced opponent to play only one tile in order to leave the last letter in bag, so the game not ended yet.

#note 6K QAID for 18 was a certain win... Playing Q and leave 1 letter in bag, unduplicate D eventhough it leave high-scoring bingo line in last column. With crucial 1 tile still in bag, Fadlan will have to score again with 7 last tile vs 1 tile which I take (since it's almost impossible he still didn't got O after QAID)

Playing DEAD has so may disadvantage, first it won't dump Q, using the only vowel, also not really blocking. Don't forget it only score 9, which is 9 points less compared to K6 QAID for 18

2 new things to learn in endgame... If you cannot block your opponent effectively, try to find another way to keep scoring high in 2 or 3 moves, and calculate the score and risk carefully. Since he hold C and V, the only dangerous medium tile is W, with only 1 medium tile, the maximum bingo there will be slightly above 100, which made him still retain the lead. The main reason why I win here, because Fadlan was too wary about set-up and didn't realized what really matter now..

#note O7 DOWNIEST or O7 DOWNSIDE. There are other possible bingo DOWNSIZE but will be countered by COVED/DOWNSIZED. Even if he play QAID, which got smacked by SNOWIER for 107, the balanced tile ACDELOV will yield him enough point to still lead even opponent go out faster... He calculated correctly that he will lost by 2 points... So just challenge
