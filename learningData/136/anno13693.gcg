#note ACIDEMIA. Awful. Didn't even look for the 5v8. That's a huge weakness of mine... four vowel rack and realizing that I should look for bingos through another vowel. As it turns out, he would have 3x3ed through my A, though.

#note And here I blow the game by completely whiffing on OESTRONE. What an obvious hook to completely blank on. ROUND wins by 1. TOTATE is just me hoping he screws up because I didn't see a win.

#note Man, it sucks to make three simply terrible blunders to blow a game like that. I definitely could have had this one. Oh well, I guess it's been a while since I laid an egg this bad; as long as it doesn't become habit. Moving along...
