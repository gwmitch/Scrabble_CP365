#note The only play I considered was I3 FANJET, but I ddn't play it for obvious reasons.  It's also ironic that I see it NOW when I didn't the turn before.

#note I didn't notice that this also plays at 10D until about twenty seconds into Dan's turn.   But playing it at K7 is better anyway.

#note I immediately said "challenge" but without hitting my clock.  Then in true Tasha-like fashion, I had to THINK about it.  But then I came to my senses and remembered that it's spelled with a Y.  Not only that, but it's not on the five vowel eight list.  Doh.
>Tasha: ADEIRRY A7 DIE.ARY +36 243
#note It took all I had not to play the bingo here.   I took about a minute looking for any huge Z plays on column A.  I don't think Dan would use the blank for a non-bingo (no matter how high scoring the play), but I'm not going to take any chances.

#note The only good thing about CIAO is the points.  I'm very much ahead, so I'm not worried about that spot.  COG is fine.

>Tasha: ABLPSUU J10 UP +14 352
#note I chickened out on LUPUS.  I had it set up on my rack.  The problem is I also had PULUS (confusing it with PUPUS) set up on my rack until I came to my senses (ULUS does NOT take a P back hook).  Naturally, I then started second guessing myself.
>Dan_Terkell: EPW H12 W.PE +39 217
>Tasha: ABEHLSU A1 HAULS +32 384
#note My least favorite play of the game.  I chickened out on BLAHS.  It is time to review my fives.  Actually, I don't need to review my fives.  I need to review my FOURS and pay attention to what takes an S.   I didn't see HABUS, either.  
>Dan_Terkell: ERTX 8K .XERT +60 277
>Tasha: ABDEGOR O3 BOGAR.ED +63 447
#note I was very close to bimboing out here.  As soon as I looked at my rack, I instinctively knew that I had a bingo through the T.  I thought of ABROGATED, but that's a nine so of course that doesn't work.  I wrote down ABDEGORT on my scoresheet and saw BOGARTED, but that's a seven so that's not going to work because it doesn't play anywhere.  I then settled on playing BROAD, but fortunately,  I came to my senses and it's a good thing too because I had an audience.  No need to have an eyewitness to what would have been a Hall of Shame moment.
>Dan_Terkell: EIINRSW 3M RI. +22 299
#note I'm not sure if this is Dan's exact rack (perhaps he had a blank thrown in somewhere), but he apparently  missed WINERIES here.  
>Tasha: AKNNNRY 12K .NAKY +32 479
#note 12K SNARK and SNAKY sim best.  I thought I messed up by not playing on column N (I thought of playing YARN).  I played SNARK at first, but then took my tiles back to play SNAKY.  I hate keeping K-Y.  
>Dan_Terkell: ?INNSVW O12 .INS +21 320
>Tasha: EMNNORV 15H .NVENOM. +14 493
#note I know I didn't make the right play.  I just couldn't resist the chance at playing this word (while blocking his outplay of course).   But I immediately regretted NOT playing a proper endgame since I didn't even break 500.
