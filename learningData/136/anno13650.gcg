#note Oh man, ALC(A)LDE is too cool. Chickened out on C(A)LVED which is what I really needed. Sim isn't too fond of this but the show must go on.

#note VEG(ETA)L is the play that I figured existed but wasn't within my scope. (A)UKLET is a cool dump although I'd probably just play (A)UK instead.

#note It's not like this rack screams "bingo". It's not a huge miss but it sure would have been a fun play (Hint: plays through the N). I also missed (Z)OUK.

#note I thought this was phony so I was really hesitant to play it. There's so many cooler plays here! (O)OGONIaL, (O)INOLOGy, OLINGOs and LOGIONs hook PARRY, I wondered about SPARRY but didn't know for sure. (D)OOdLING and (D)rOOLING are perfectly normal alternatives so lucky for me I didn't phony.
