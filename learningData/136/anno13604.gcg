>John_Dearchs: NOW 8G OWN +12 12
#note Oh look, he gives me points
>Winter: AAHNOTU 7G HAO +28 28
#note ??? favors leaving AAN, AO, ANO???
>John_Dearchs: CNNO 9E CONN +20 32
#note Okay, this was brainless on my part. No idea why I thought this was Collins.
>Winter: AEINTTU -  +0 28
#note FUCK!!! Even as I challenged, I had a feeling their might be something, but only UNCINATE, UINTAITE, and AUTUNITE had jumped out at me. I have trouble with TUNICATE.
>John_Dearchs: PS F8 S.P +18 50
#note Great. He's going to have fun with eses.

>Winter: AEINTTU E9 .UT +14 42
#note Sims well, but I had a bad feeling anyway.
>John_Dearchs: A -A +0 50
#note I smell trouble.
>Winter: AEEIINT 12D TENIA +18 60
#note Not 100% on TENIAE, and keeping the E is not horrible.
>John_Dearchs: JLRS H11 J.RLS +36 86
#note Figured.
>Winter: DDEIIMR 6H MID +22 82
>John_Dearchs: ?GILOOT 13H .OOTLInG +68 154
#note Lame.
>Winter: DEHIPRT O11 DI.HT +33 115
>John_Dearchs: DEZ J12 D.ZE +34 188
#note Awesome. More power tiles.
>Winter: AEEGNPR 11H .EAN +37 152
#note Hate to ruin my chances for a bingo, but I need to score, and more hooks in case I can draw an ess (fat chance of that).
>John_Dearchs: IQ N10 QI +34 222
#note This motherfucker's going to draw all the power tiles, isn't he.
>Winter: EEGPRWY L12 P.EW +26 178
#note Type a note here!
>John_Dearchs: DIL 5I LID +15 237
#note Here's where the travesty starts.

>Winter: AEGORUY L4 YOU +17 195
#note Stupid, but nothing compared to what John is about to do.
>John_Dearchs: U 14N U. +12 249
#note This is going to get sad.
>Winter: AEEFGOR 13C FORE +25 220
#note Gotta give myself a hook, low-prob thought it might be, because if John bingoes to that S, the game might be over.
>John_Dearchs: GR J3 GR.. +6 255
#note This guy is actually going to let me catch up. But that G--with only one O, it's trouble.
>Winter: AEEFGTV 14B VEG +23 243
#note VEG is obvious. John clearly will have trouble bingoing to the G versus the ess, and he's low on time. If he cannot bingo, he WILL lose, even with the motherfucking X.
>John_Dearchs: B F12 ..B +11 266
#note This guy.
>Winter: AEEFRTU 15C TAU +16 259
#note I like my Es for E(N)A(T)E or (L)E(Z).
>John_Dearchs: V 11M V.. +7 273
#note Wow.
>Winter: AEEFKMR K10 E.A.E +23 282
#note I hate the leave, obviously, but I finally take the lead, but I'm still fucked with what happens next.
>John_Dearchs: C 10D C.. +7 280
#note GODDAMN IT TO HELL!!!
>Winter: ABEFKMR M1 FAKE +27 309
#note The rest of the game is just waiting for the bingo.
>John_Dearchs: OX 1M .OX +39 319
#note MOTHERFUCKER!!! I KNEW THIS  MOTHERFUCKER WOULD X ME!!! THAT'S SEVEN POWER TILES!!!
>Winter: ABEIMRY 2L R.MI +29 338
#note I waned (O)BIA, but you know he's just going to score off that spot. I couldn't do it. Quack likes these plays that give back a hook, but that's stupid given all John is capable of doing is trying to bingo.
>John_Dearchs: S 5I ....S +18 337
#note This motherfucker has both esses.
>Winter: ?AABELY 3H YA. +8 346
#note I have no choice. I have to hope he bingos and that I bingo out.
>John_Dearchs: R L4 ...R +7 344
#note AARRGHH!!!
>Winter: ?ABEEIL H1 AB.E +30 376
#note AARRGHH!!! I SAW BAILEES BUT TALKED MYSELF OUT OF IT!!!

Even worse, I could still have won it if I had a blocking play, but everything I saw allowed him to hook (Y)E or (Y)A!!!

FML!!!
FML!!!
FML!!!
>John_Dearchs: AEINRST C4 RETAINS +67 411
#note Oh look, he misses the good plays, to boot.
>John_Dearchs:  (EIL?) +6 417
