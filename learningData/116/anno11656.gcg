>Avery_Mojica: EIILPPR 8G PIP +14 14
#note I found LIPPIER, but it didn't look right.
>Aaron_Daly: BIINT 9F BINIT +21 21
#note I don't always double-check the math of my opponents... Scored as 19.
>Avery_Mojica: CEILRRT 10E REC +20 34
#note I thought RELIC would open up too much.
>Aaron_Daly: AA 10J AA +8 29
#note If he had moved it one space to the left... Or put it at 11G... More points than this at the least. Hm.
>Avery_Mojica: EILRTTU 11I TUI +13 47
#note Maybe UT would have been better. 2 Points less overall, 2 points more in valuation.
>Aaron_Daly: EEY 11C EYE +16 45
#note Two spaces to the right and he doubles the points of this play...
>Avery_Mojica: AEILRTU 12B UTA +18 65
#note Why do I ALWAYS miss Uralite, then see it right after the game is done? Way to go, genius. I should know this.
>Aaron_Daly: AGO 13C AGO +21 66
>Avery_Mojica: EHILRSU L4 HURLIES +75 140
>Aaron_Daly: EJRV 8K J.VER +45 111
>Avery_Mojica: ADDHKRU 12K DUH +18 158
#note Who else knew DHAK was a word that is rated below 1200? Sheesh. I did know KHEDA, I wasn't looking around there though. I should have. Watch this.
>Aaron_Daly: ?IILNOZ O1 LIONIZe. +101 212
#note Ouch. That really sucks. Actually, if he had written this down on the "Highest Scoring Bingo" sheet, he would have won it, since George Asaka had the highest, but was going to get a place prize. That's a really confusing story. (George got 104 from the word OVERHAND.)
>Avery_Mojica: AADIRSY 6J YA.D +16 174
>Aaron_Daly: EMW 13L MEW +30 242
>Avery_Mojica: AAILORS 5D SOLARIA +69 243
>Aaron_Daly: ?EEORST 7B SOlERET +70 312
#note He took a long time with this play, since he wanted to find a parallel play to SOLARIA. There isn't one. This was scored as 72.
>Avery_Mojica: AIKLNOX 8A LOX +41 284
#note I thought about MEWL, but it didn't look right. And the good play there is KAOLIN, which I definitely didn't know. I was tempted to play KLAXONS because of its beauty, but this was more defensive.
>Aaron_Daly: BEGOT 4A BEGOT +28 340
>Avery_Mojica: AIKNNOT A1 KNO. +30 314
#note Wins the valuation, KNIT and KNOT at N2 are 4 more game points.
>Aaron_Daly: Q 2N Q. +22 362
>Avery_Mojica: AACINOT H1 ACTO. +24 338
#note I needed points. And this had a good leave. This next play of mine will be awesome.
>Aaron_Daly: EFW N7 F.W +13 375
#note He can't block my big play. He said afterwards that all he could do was open up more spots for it and/or give me more points.
>Avery_Mojica: AEGIMNS 14D SEAMING +76 414
#note I was really happy to find this.
>Aaron_Daly: DDEENRV H12 VE.N +33 408
#note NERVED 2A wins the valuation by about 3. This is second and has 5 more game points.
>Avery_Mojica: FN B3 F.N +11 425
#note Wow. I beat Aaron. Twice. I feel really good about myself right now.
>Avery_Mojica:  (RDDE) +12 437
