>Avery_Mojica: ?ABEILT 8G LIB +10 10
#note I'm so smart. I missed every bingo. I thought of LIBRATE but wasn't sure.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEJNRTU H3 JAUNT.ER +66 66
#note Good one.
>Avery_Mojica: ?AEGITU F6 AUGITEs +68 78
#note *sarcastically* Yeah, I totally would have found BIJUGATE.
>Matthew_Ridout: CQWXYYZ -CQWY +0 66
#note I don't know what he had, but he exchanged 4.
>Avery_Mojica: DFILRTV 11C FIV.R +22 100
#note I found the best play. Good for me.
>Matthew_Ridout: EGN 12B GEN +17 83
>Avery_Mojica: DDLRRTT -DDLRT +0 100
#note Dumb consonants.
>Matthew_Ridout: NOT 13A TON +21 104
>Avery_Mojica: AEERRTW A13 .EW +18 118
#note WATERER doesn't play. This was the best play.
>Matthew_Ridout: EEP 3H .EEP +14 118
#note VEEP E11 was best. This works out later for me though, wonder why he opened it up so much. Quackle keeps saying this is worth 13... This is worth 14. Hm.
>Avery_Mojica: AAERRTU 15A .AUR +8 126
#note It was a risk. I liked it though.
>Matthew_Ridout: ELSW L3 SLEW +28 146
#note Wow. Using an S for that? I wonder what's going on with his racks.
>Avery_Mojica: AAENRRT K5 NARRATE +87 213
#note I like SLEW now. This play took a total of 13 seconds. Then again, I used his time to find NARRATE, which took me a while for some reason.
>Matthew_Ridout: MO J5 OM +27 173
>Avery_Mojica: ADHISTY L11 THY +20 233
#note Uh. RHYTA is a word? I bet any 1100 ranked player would know that. I figured by now he was fishing, and THY would block off many of the plays. He complimented me on it later, saying it was a good move.
>Matthew_Ridout: CINU 8K .UNIC +24 197
#note I tend to learn my 5s by playing Matthew.
>Avery_Mojica: ADEEISX M12 AE +19 252
#note All my available X plays opened up too many points for him. I didn't like it. This blocked the board down even more, plus it scored decently. I figured I could play the X later and get at least more than 10 from it.
>Matthew_Ridout: COZ E4 COZ +39 236
>Avery_Mojica: DDEINSX J10 INDEX +38 290
#note I liked this play. So did he. However, I didn't realize my racks to come would disagree. XENIC 4A looks cool.
>Matthew_Ridout: AO 4D O.A +10 246
#note He told me later he had an S, and he was planning to play a bingo, hooking the S to play SOCA. I didn't know that was a word. So I didn't bother blocking it.
>Avery_Mojica: ADDDKMS N12 DAK +29 319
#note Good play, I was hoping to get some vowels out of the decent pool. Little did I know that all I was going to get was, well, crap.
>Matthew_Ridout: AGIORST O1 ORGASTI. +86 332
#note Ouch. That's gonna bite me later.
>Avery_Mojica: BDDHMQS 7N Q. +22 341
#note I probably should have exchanged. I don't know what I was thinking. My tracking was correct this game, so I don't know what I was doing.
>Matthew_Ridout: OY 2J YO +30 362
>Avery_Mojica: BDDHMPS 1K HM +18 359
#note I'll block off the triple lane. I couldn't make out my tracking, but there were a ton of one-point tiles left and I figured he'd find some random 7 I had never heard of.
>Matthew_Ridout: EIL O10 LIE +13 375
#note LIVE E9 was better. I don't need him finding the best plays though. I have a chance to win. Lowest seed vs. Top seed and I'm this close? I can do it! Wait. My racks. Well this is stupid.
>Avery_Mojica: BDDFPSV D3 F.B +12 371
#note I was amazed that my last draw was the F and the V. The only high-scoring tiles. In my head, I said "Goddammit" to myself so many times, I lost track at 30. ;)
>Matthew_Ridout: ?EIIOOS C2 OI +14 389
#note He missed ISTHMI 1H. Good thing he didn't notice it, 14 is better than 35 in this scenario. For me at least. I want to prove that I can play close.
>Avery_Mojica: DDLPSV N7 ..S +12 383
#note I can't believe I drew one of the two consonants left in the bag. L and S. And it wasn't the S. I was really irritated at this point. I don't think I showed it though. I hope I didn't. But Matthew was surprised when he drew the last 3 vowels out of the bag (he knew it based on his tracking.)
>Matthew_Ridout: ?EIOS 15N SI +15 404
#note He missed all the plays to go out. I guess he figured he would extend his points as far as he could since I wasn't about to go out any time soon.Then again, if he would have gone out, he would have gotten a bunch of points off of me. So it wasn't too bad. POISE, NOISE, and HOISE for those wondering.
>Avery_Mojica: DDLPV 13I P. +7 390
#note Wow. That's the best play.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?EO H13 OEs +11 415
#note OPEs, OPEn, OPEd, whatever. Still good. I'm glad I was able to play a rather close game with him. He said afterwards that I easily got outdrawn, and if it was a friendly game, he would have called it a tie.
