#note PAH probably isn't as good as usual. Conrad hesitated on QUOD, so it seems fairly reasonable to put him on a vowel-heavy leave. I actually didn't think of that during the tournament. I also didn't see BRAND 9K, though that might not be right if we believe he is vowel-heavy. Not sure if this is right though...DPS isn't anything to write home about.

#note Or the other FED. His leave after ICE is pretty good on average, but not good enough that I should try for my own bingo. I think I need to do this in hopes of blocking next turn, rather than play FED O13. Conrad thought this was a bad idea given ICE, but I don't agree.

#note There is a really really really really sick play here. I don't think it wins games but it is too amazing.

#note GAPS is a little better.
