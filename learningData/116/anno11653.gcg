>Avery_Mojica: AABELNS I9 .A +7 149
#note I'm surprised this is 9th on Quackle's list. SABAL, SABE, bleh. Most of the higher plays used the S or the N. I'd save them. Besides, this was 24.4, the highest (SABAL) was 28.6. Not a big difference.

#note Did he know POUFED?
>Avery_Mojica: BEEEPRS N4 REP +26 208
#note BEFOULED. Nice find, Quackle. REP blocks the triple better than BEEP.
>Aaron_Daly: EKOW O1 WOKE +39 243
#note Drat. By the way, on our scoresheets by now, we had miscounted quite a bit. It showed 242 - 211.
>Avery_Mojica: BEEEOSU -BEEOU +0 208
#note I still miss BEFOULED. I exchange.

#note Wow. I found the best play.
>Aaron_Daly: EGILRS O10 LIGERS +31 299
>Avery_Mojica: ?EGNRST 1L GN.. +10 244
#note Woken is better. I saw it. But i need to open the board. This endgame is awesome though.
>Aaron_Daly: ABO N12 ABO +21 320
#note Mistake on him. Because...
>Avery_Mojica: ?EJORST M12 JOT +44 288
#note Yep.
>Aaron_Daly: RUU L1 .URU +10 330
#note This was the worst mistake. He could have exchanged. This helped me though. Because...
>Avery_Mojica: ?EENRSS 3F ENSuRE.S +66 354
#note Booyah! I missed SNEERERS. But I played this confidently. He help for a long time calculating if he challenged and if he could have won. He challenged it eventually and lost.
