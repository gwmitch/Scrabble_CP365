#note He exchanged two. Not sure what it was.
>Avery_Mojica: AENNQRS -NQ +0 55
#note Dammit. Not a Q. And a repeat consonant. This is a bad omen.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEIRSTT 11E ARTIEST +91 134
#note The exchange worked well for him. Good one. But ouch.
>Avery_Mojica: AELNRSU 10E LEU +13 68
#note I didn't feel like opening up the board for some reason.

#note I could have sworn this was good. Confused with PRAWNS most likely? He did spend about 3 minutes holding this. He said he liked that it made him think. Then again, after being down 121 points, what do I have to lose?

#note Well. I actually did find CAMEOING in his rack. Didn't remember to tell him though. I held on this, but do I really dare to challenge a much higher rated player than me? Not a chance. P.S. there was MAGNESIC and GENOMIC playable too.
>Avery_Mojica: INRSSTV 14F VIS +23 189
#note DIVANS. Gotta remember that. Good hook.
>Matthew_Ridout: DEIO O11 DO.IE +24 376
>Avery_Mojica: FNNRSTT -FNRT +0 189
#note Well. This reminds me of our earlier game. Ridout must be laughing on the inside.
>Matthew_Ridout: EQTUU H1 TUQUE +47 423
#note OMFG. Are you kidding me? This guy is getting everything. But honestly, now even I'm just laughing it off.
>Avery_Mojica: HNRRRST 2G H.RT +9 198
#note I can't believe I drew 3 Rs. This is just B.S. But I'm still laughing it off. I should have known RUTH. Or THR(ow)N.

>Avery_Mojica: FHNNRRS M12 F.RN +7 205
#note And yet I still didn't get any vowels. Matthew and I were having a good laugh though. I didn't think about exchanging for some reason. But Quackle says I found the best non-exchanging move.
>Matthew_Ridout: AEY E4 YEA +17 464
#note He missed putting it at N4, N2, and 7L.
>Avery_Mojica: CEHINRS 1J INCHES +44 249
#note I finally got vowels. Good enough. It didn't matter. Watch what he does.
>Matthew_Ridout: ?EINOST O1 .tONIEST +74 538
#note He said "In all funniness, let me show you my rack." He showed me. We both laughed. That was unbelievable. And I was left with this s**t? Well that was interesting. And in all the humor, he missed the same word at 1A. LOL - well another well played one to Ridout. 293 though. Ouch.
