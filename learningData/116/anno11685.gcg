>Kolton_Koehler: DIP 8G DIP +12 12
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?FGHRSX H7 F.X +13 13
#note Quackle approves.
>Kolton_Koehler: AEIKNPS J4 KEPIS +24 36
#note Quackle fails to even acknowledge KEPIS. (D)AK KI(F) KA(F) rank well. KE(P)I I6 is Q's runner-up to (D)AK G8. KEPIS gives up to much for not enough.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??AGHRS 5E cHAnG.RS +90 103
#note There's at least 14 90pt 2x2's here. I preferred making the first letter one that's unhookable.
>Kolton_Koehler: ADEZ L1 DAZE. +34 70
#note This and ADZE 4L come out equal.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELRTUV 10D VAULTER +78 181
#note I was held here.
>Kolton_Koehler: AET M1 ETA +33 103
>Gunther_Jacobi: ACHILOR 1F CHLORI.. +42 223
#note If row 1 hadn't been blocked I would've attempted the phoney: CHOR(D)IAL for 176. CHLORI(DE) beats HI(AT)AL 2J by a significant margin.
>Kolton_Koehler: E J10 .E +2 105
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAELRSU D9 U.EAL +16 239
#note Was hoping my opponent would expose an O for AUREOLAS. Plays through the V rank best, but its (V)AU D10 that leads the pack. AELRS hits a lot. U(V)EAL is 9pts back.
>Kolton_Koehler: GY 11C G.Y +24 129
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEERRSW 12H SWEARER +75 314
>Kolton_Koehler: AEILNU N8 ALEU.IN +18 147
#note I held on this phoney. I knew ANEURIN...but this just looked suspicious. Kolton is a world class boggler, so that combined with the fact I had a decent rejoinder convinced me to allow it.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AIMNNOT O8 MON +31 345
#note I missed several cool sixes here: MANITO O4, AMNION O3, TINMAN O5, NOMINA O4. Suprisingly, MON O8 takes the gold medal.
>Kolton_Koehler: DOW O13 DOW +26 173
>Gunther_Jacobi: AINNSTT K10 ST.IN +25 370
#note K11 T(A)N for 10 and T(U)N 9C are the star plays here. Having the case S, I should have been more alert to my own possibilities and gunned at running up the spread.
>Kolton_Koehler: CIN F1 .INC. +14 187
#note Creating a lane.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABNNOTT M12 .BON +27 397
#note Quackle agrees.
>Kolton_Koehler: AJO H12 .OJA +33 220
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABGNQTT M6 QAT +18 415
#note Q(A)T 15G is 1.2 ahead. B(U)G 9C is also interesting.
>Kolton_Koehler: IO 14H .OI. +13 233
>Gunther_Jacobi: BGNOTUV N3 GUV +20 435
#note This or VU(L)GO 13B.
>Kolton_Koehler: MY 9C Y.M +20 253
>Gunther_Jacobi: BDENOOT 3C BON.ET +16 451
#note DOOB(I)E 2B seems to be the play, blocking anything to the Y or through the N. BON(N)ET valuates at 0.2.

>Kolton_Koehler: EEFIIRT 1C TRI........ +18 271
#note TRICHLORIDE! A phoney, yes, but it seemed plausible.TREF or REIF or REEF 4A for 30 are obviously the plays, but this gets some style points indeed, as well as an optimal out play for me. And by the way, there are only two five-letter front extensions for CHLORIDE (as I now know), TETRA and HYDRO.
