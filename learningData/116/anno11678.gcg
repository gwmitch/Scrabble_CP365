#note FADS is definitely the play here. I passed up stuff like DEFATS because it gave so much back (underlaps). FADS does sort of the same thing. I loved how EFS didn't open up too much, but with my tiles, I should be trying to open the board up. This wouldn't be bad if I had an R for REFS, but it makes no sense with my current leave.

#note Attempting to correct last turn's mistake. I liked this more than TAJ.

#note This is Collins. Ugh, I need to freshen up my fives knowledge. It looked fishy to me, I swear.

#note I debated between this and plays on the C column (TOEA, OLEA). C column plays are nice and defensive, killing the dangerous A column, but JIAO keeps the board wide open with a bingo-prone leave. Maybe I was wrong to play open with a lead, but with a rack of one-pointers, I won't hold a lead on a closed board for long. At any rate, I don't think it's an easy decision here. My play definitely did not work out.

#note Liked this over TWINY, but I completely whiffed on WINTLE, which keeps the Y to score next turn.

#note In hindsight, I should not have inferred bingo tiles from Adam's play. Why would he kill the L if he has the blank? Stupid for me not to realise that. Instead I played some knee-jerk bingo defense and don't block the real scoring threat on column C. C1 OWE is definitely the play.
