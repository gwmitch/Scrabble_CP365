>Jackson_Smylie: ?AEINRU 8B ANEURIn +64 64
#note I thought ANEURIn didn't put a vowel next to a dls. This puts a U in the double double which I like. I also have a small hope she'll stick an E at the end.
>Yvonne_Lobo: AEGGINT H8 .EGATING +80 80
>Jackson_Smylie: GNOUUYY 10H .UY +15 79
#note Gahhhhhh I balked on U(N)YOUNG. I had already lost too many challenges this tournament, and unyoung just doesn't make a whole lot of sense as a word. U(N)YOUNG would have saved me. Also GUYO(T). 
>Yvonne_Lobo: EEILSTT 14G E.TITLES +70 150
#note Her clock is around 18 minutes at this point.
>Jackson_Smylie: CDGNOUY L12 UG.Y +24 103
#note Gahhhh balked on UNGOD(L)Y. 
>Yvonne_Lobo: DF G7 D.F +22 172
>Jackson_Smylie: ACDIJNO 12B ADJOIN. +30 133
#note I am not playing JA(R). ADJOI(N) looks nice, as well as CONID(I)A. JI(A)O is fine. 
>Yvonne_Lobo: KLW B11 W.LK +22 194
#note The thing I hate about trying to catch up is that your opponents make plays too :(
>Jackson_Smylie: BCIILRR D4 LIBR. +14 147
#note I always get mixed up over LIBRA vs LIBRE*. BIRL(E) is good in the same place. BR(O)IL, RIBI(E)R, and B(O)RIC are all good, but I like how LIBR(E)* opens things up and doesn't rely on the M column and the N column (unless I get an S).
>Yvonne_Lobo: CMOP N10 COMP. +17 211
>Jackson_Smylie: ACINNRW E11 W.N +12 159
#note I suppose RAWIN is good for volatility, but I prefer WIN for the possibility of hooking them. W(O)N is a few points down.
>Yvonne_Lobo: OVV 5C V.VO +20 231
>Yvonne_Lobo: OVV --  -20 211
>Jackson_Smylie: ACINNRZ J6 ZINC. +39 198
#note CZARIN(A) is cool.
>Yvonne_Lobo: OVVX K11 OX +27 238
>Jackson_Smylie: AHINRRS B7 R.H +6 204
#note OX closed the S hook on GUY, and ZINC(Y) closed the I in LIBR(E). I don't need to bingo. R(A)H plainly sucks. RAH is just better. K5 RAN is good as well.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ATVV K5 VAT +25 263
>Jackson_Smylie: AAINORS 13L .A. +16 220
#note O(D)A looks good now, I didn't know AINORS was 4 points worse than AINRS. I can just try to sneak into the lead, as the prospect of bingoing doesn't look too good. I don't really know what I was trying to do here besides score more than 10 and hoping she opens. i was also hoping for something good on the triple. ANI is nice as it gives me the R hook. 
>Yvonne_Lobo: ADMPV E3 PAD +20 283
#note She put down MAP first which doesn't give me a lane. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AINORRS 9J .OR +5 225
#note I(ZA)R scores and opens, I like it. I could also play RA(J) and score. I think I(ZA)R is just clearly right. Damn.
>Yvonne_Lobo: AEIMSTV M7 VIM +26 309
>Jackson_Smylie: AEFINRS 3E .ANFRIES +65 290
#note She couldn't block my bingo. I should have just scored more so I didn't have to keep fighting after my bingo.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ADEEHST -  +0 309
>Jackson_Smylie: AILOOQR J2 Q. +31 321
#note I really needed that challenge. 
>Yvonne_Lobo: ADEEHST H1 HE.T +33 342
#note HA(F)TED, or if she doesn't know it HE(F)TED.
>Jackson_Smylie: ABILOOR 13B .OO. +23 344
#note Nothing else scores.
>Yvonne_Lobo: DESU 15A USED +33 375
>Jackson_Smylie: ABILORT 4D ..B +9 353
#note I didn't see any way to outrun, as she very likely has the S and ? or at least one of them. I feel I need to bingo to win, and with 5/9 tiles being E's, I need to fish for an E. I can fish off the O to get TRIABLE/LIBRATE, but I assume she will block the A column as ostensibly more bingoes will play there. If she had checked her tracking, she could have blocked the bingo I fished for, but I had to hope she would just immediatlely pounce on the A column.
>Yvonne_Lobo: ?AEEEOS A6 OE +4 379
>Jackson_Smylie: AEILORT 1A AEROLIT. +86 439
#note Very exciting finish, waiting for her to block the A column or the 1 row was extremely nerve-wracking. We were looking at the preendgame before adding her rack to my score and mistakingly included the O in the addition.
