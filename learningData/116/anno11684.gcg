#note This is from a one-day in San Antonio, managed by Caesar Jaramillo, who's sort of a superman of Directors, traveling all the way down from Lubbock.  July 15, 2012.

Nice to see I can change my rack in Quackle now - as long as the move committed isn't changed, it doesn't erase the following moves.  I think it used to erase my turns if I just changed the rack in some bad ol' version of Quackle, like 0.96.  Yay, Quackle 0.97!! You rule!

I'm on some kind of Super Brain diet to improve cognitive functioning.  Let's see if it helps!

First rack: don't remember it but the leave is some subset of 
WARP + HIT + BANDI.O? . For utopia+x, Quackle recommends to play UTOPIA for 18 on 8H or 8C.





>Early: DEILNOU 9G UNOILED +74 74
#note This bingo is valid but paradoxically one can not "unoil" something.



>Leeds: APRW 8L WARP +51 69
#note My rack here may have been actually AIPRTW? and in that case, I missed WIRETAPS. 

>Early: DEPUV J6 UPD.VE +22 96
>Leeds: ?BEHIOT K11 HIT +22 91
#note Missed some bingos, and why did I use the T? Didn't want Mike to use my HI hook too easily, was my thought.

>Early: LNOO K3 LOON +10 106
>Leeds: ?ABDINO 13F BANDI.Os +76 167
#note Not OBs(I)DIAN, not OBsID(I)AN, not DeBONAI(R), but .....
>Early: AJT I4 TAJ +20 126
>Leeds: EEFRRSZ H3 FEZ +30 197
#note Quackle's "ask championshp player" is telling me FEZ is slightly inferior to REEFS 14G for 43, keeping ZR.  




>Early: IQ M7 Q..I +24 150
>Leeds: AAMRRSS L1 MAARS +28 225
#note MAARS sims best from AAMRRSS and that is what it seems my rack was.  I wish I had played MARS instead though.




>Early: ?EFILNT 1H FILa.ENT +158 308
>Leeds: AAGNSSV H11 VA.G +9 234
#note Quackle likes VANGS better for 30.  This turned out to work pretty well.

>Early: AELRY 14B EARLY +47 355
>Leeds: CEIRSSW 15H SCREW +69 303
#note I noticed WISEACRES doesn't play.
Quackle's "bogowin" estimated win percentage is about 10%.




>Early: ACEOTU O5 OUT.ACE +11 366
>Leeds: EHIKNSS A12 KINS +48 351
#note Quackle likes KINS ok.  So sad about KNISHES not fitting.

>Early: EIR 15H .....IER +39 405
>Leeds: EGHIRSY A8 GHER.... +48 399
#note Look at me! Mike complimented it as a great find, but he is going to win anyway.


>Early: ADOT B7 TOAD +24 429
>Leeds: EIIMNSY D10 MISE.Y +30 429
#note Sim shows my choice was 7 points behind YE 8D because of the nice S hook.  My regret was that I'd not played MIRY. I'd assumed Mike could play like Quackle, and Quackle would not let me go out in two this week.


>Early: BEEGOOT E7 BEGOT +24 453
>Leeds: IN G3 IN +12 441
#note Went over by 3 seconds looking for an out play that didn't use NI .

So the adjusted score is 453-435, I lost by 18.  Could be worse, Mike got a triple-triple and a won high word prize for the division.

My main lesson from this game is to try once in a while to keep good combinations of consonants: that is what Mike does, and he gets some excellent bingos from that.


>Leeds:  (EO) +4 445
