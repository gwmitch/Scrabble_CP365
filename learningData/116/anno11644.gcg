#note I guess Jesse probably doesn't want to telegraph the S, hence no QUADS. QUASS might be too much to pass up though.

#note I realize this is a 10 point equity sacrifice compared to TORT. But I thought this had a good chance of giving him no bingo. One point Jesse made is that he could draw JEST anyway and put me in big trouble. Maybe I should just play TORT and wait.

>Noah_Walton: JLMMORT J2 J.LT +27 350
#note I thought the Ms would be good on this board, but JORAM blocks a lot of good places to score, so maybe that's right after all. I think I overrated the Ms by a lot.

#note I didn't think of O(W)E 7G. OWE gives me more chances at big plays along column B, which I will probably need to win the game. The O doesn't really do anything helpful on this board. Also, it doesn't seem like playing two is that much different than playing one in this circumstance, so OWE looks like a better play.

#note (O)NTO looks better.
