#note K5 IN(FAN)TA.  I initially put down 11H (A)VAUNT which sims a bit better, but I didn't want to get Z'd at F10.

>Wayne: DEEIORU --  -77 115
#note FOUS# (and UFOS#) incidentally.  Who says Collins screws you up?  That's twice I recognized a Collins four this series.
>Jeremy: BCEJMPW 4H C.P +10 156
#note I overdrew, and Wayne saw MIC.  He threw the I in the bag.  I was attempting to block SO(U)RDINE at 4G, but I kind of goofed up because of something I didn't spot.  H4 JUMP looked good at first, but JUMPS lands on the DWS and is costly. 12D JEW wins the sim knowing INDORSE is Wayne's rack.
>Wayne: DEINORS N3 DINEROS +73 188
>Jeremy: ABEJMRW 12D JAW +35 191
#note 12D JEW? it's close.
>Wayne: EILNORV O1 OVEN +30 218
>Jeremy: BEHMQRS N11 MESH +27 218
#note I considered trading here because Q is a lousy tile on this board.  O7 SH is lovely for pts (missed it!), but 6F BREAM wins the sim.  If you play MESH, it goes at K2.

#note G5 LEAP.  I'm not sure if I got the N right on Wayne's rack here.
>Jeremy: BCEGLQT -BCGLQ +0 241
#note Quack says exch BEGLQT keeping C!  I wouldn't have done that on this board.
>Wayne: EEIIKLN 5I ..KE +16 282
#note 3K ELI(DE)
>Jeremy: ?EIRTUZ L1 ZaIR. +46 287
#note Duck says D12 (J)UTE, but ZaIR(E) sims pretty good.  I counted it as 56 points not 46.  Oops!
>Wayne: AAEIILN M1 AI +14 296
>Jeremy: ACDEGTU G9 TA. +18 305
#note 10B CADGY.  I feel compelled to keep the U for the Q.
>Wayne: BEEILNY 15M .YE +37 333
>Jeremy: CDEGGQU D12 .UG +11 316
#note 2J QU(aI) 20% to win.  Missed it!  Also 4E EGG(CUP) 15%.  sheesh!  Just about overtime, I inexplicably make a crazy play ditching the last U hoping for some extreme endgame luck.  JUG is just 7.5% to win.
>Wayne: BEILLNW 14B BI. +12 345
#note 14A WIN(G) is 53% to win.  This is just 22%.
>Jeremy: CDEGLQS 15A GEDS +41 357
#note 13C L(U)G is 25% to win.  this is 12.5%.  The last tile in the bag is.... THE BLANK!!!
>Wayne: EILLLNW 8N .W +15 360
#note 3K L(I) wins 100%.  It is the only game winning play for Wayne.  However, I am in my first minute of overtime, and need to think hard.
>Jeremy: ?CLQ 3K Q. +11 368
#note Lucky I didn't spot 2J Qu(aI).  This is tops.  If you spot the out.
>Wayne: EILLLN 6H N.. +6 366
#note 6M NEE, one better.
>Jeremy: ?CL 1I CoL.. +15 383
#note whew!  wild ride.
