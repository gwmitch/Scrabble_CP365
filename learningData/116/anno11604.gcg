#note I was torn between trying VAPIDER* and playing faired. eventually I decided it was no good, but I didn't even bother looking for a superior play - fervid would've been miles better...

#note I held for a bit. this is a nice play.
>JD: ?ADNRSV 13K D.VAN +21 263
#note this is a bit of a gamble but clearly the best way to maximize my position in an even game.
>Jon_Shreve: ?ABBOUX B2 UnBOX +85 321
#note I believe his leave was ?ABU, so he was thinking about just playing BOX. that said this wins the sim handily.
>JD: ?EEMNRS O6 REiNSME. +80 343
#note the game is basically a dead heat.

>JD: CEEKLLT 10K L.CK. +23 366
#note I felt great about this move, seeing as it blocks a lot of the remaining bingo lanes and scores. but that's not really what I should be worried about here - with a very vowel-heavy and one point tile-heavy pool I need to try to guarantee scoring for next turn. the best combo I can keep that'll achieve that seems to be CEKL, which has the potential to lead to good scoring plays on column N or respond to any plays he makes there. Thus the two best plays are LET at M8 or LECH at I9, with LET being best. after LUCKS I will have a very hard time scoring. non-intuitive play!

>JD: EELOSTY 10E SY. +30 396
#note thank goodness, I found one of my two best options here. I did not see SEEDY at all but I had SYN ready to go with a few minutes left on my clock and kept looking down to the wire.
>Jon_Shreve: EIT M2 TIE +15 386
#note pretty awesome play that describes itself!
>Jon_Shreve:  (EELOT) +10 396
#note I recounted it just for fun and the scores came back the same. what a tense end to day 1!
