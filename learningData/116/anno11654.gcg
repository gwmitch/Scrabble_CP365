#note it ain't looking so good all of a sudden. I liked that this set up the potential G hook he might not notice and kept things open in general.

>JD: EENORTU D3 OUTRE +16 279
#note I did not spot UTERI/BRAZER, which looks really good. points are good and I have ok lanes already, although the best ones at the bottom can all be blocked. TUREEN is not a bad choice too.

#note I didn't even spot my best play (VAUNTY) but exchanging is pretty intriguing with the bag looking as it is. I could maybe keep a C.

#note doh! this is phony! I figured I was screwed no matter what but I could've given myself a chance!
