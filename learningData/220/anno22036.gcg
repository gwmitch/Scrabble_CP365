#note Basically Andrew had beaten me handily TWICE before this game, so I'm not happy having to play him again.  His style of play is somewhat frustrating because he tends to close the board down rather quickly.  Like he will go out of his way to take away potential hooks.  Anyway, Whoever wins this game gets 3rd for the tourney.  3 players had the same record but I had the highest cum.

#note couldn't decide between playing boa at 10J or jab.  Thought he was sitting on an S and didn't want to create a easy word to hoook.

#note boa would have blocked this off luv but he could have played it off boa for less.

#note amazingly this is the only winning move.  playing qi at 12A leaves open (A)UK as an outplay for the win.

There was a little bit of drama because originally the game was scored 343 to 344; the recount utimately ended the game 345 to 344.  underscored fog and qis by 1 pt each.  That was a rollercoaster ride.  After losing 2 recounts at Nationals this came as a relief.
