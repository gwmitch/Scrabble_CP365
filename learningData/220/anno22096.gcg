>Dave: IIIIIII -III +0 0
>Randi: EEGIIST 8G GIE +8 8
#note Oh hey I don't know what to do. You know, for a change.
>Dave: AHORSTX I2 THORAX.S +81 81
#note Well I clearly should have known that trade 3 means he's going to draw into that :)
>Randi: EEINSTW G1 SWEETIN. +64 72
#note I decided to play the bingo even though I didn't know if it was a bingo. If I'm gonna go down, I'm gonna do it with style. 
>Dave: ABEHRT 1A BATHER. +48 129
#note But he didn't flinch!

>Randi: AMNORWY F4 YAM +31 103
#note I didn't love this. 
>Dave: GU J6 GU +23 152
>Randi: DDJNORW E3 JOW +44 147
#note Dislike leave, like points.
>Dave: ERTZ 3I .ERTZ +34 186
#note That hertz! Okay, not really, I just really wanted to make the joke. :D
>Randi: DDINORT L1 DI.TO +16 163
#note No idea what to do. 
>Dave: FGLNU M5 FLUNG +17 203
>Randi: AADENNR 8M .AN +9 172
#note So this was probably not the best, but the board was weird (other than the BAT) and my rack was beginning to look vaguely bingo-y. Also, I didn't know what to do. 
>Dave: ILPU C1 .ULIP +14 217
#note I presume he saw through my not so devious plan... and probably had a weird rack. 
>Randi: ADEINOR L9 ANEROID +73 245
#note Yay bingo!
>Dave: ?CIINOP 15E PINaCOI. +86 303
#note Yay bingo for me, not him. Also I have never seen this before and decide to be bold and challenge, but of course its good. How do I do that in the Quackle?
>Randi: ?DEEOOY K10 OYE +26 271
#note Okay so here I see that I could play it up a couple spots for way fewer points and that will leave the E and the R bingoable, but I feel like he'll see through that plan. Also this keeps me in fighting distance and also there are a few other lines. I also figured I could potentially get through the ER. Definitely didn't like this much though. 
>Dave: AEEI O6 AI.EE +5 308
#note Well there goes one of those other lanes... 
>Randi: ?ADENOS A1 .ANDOrES +86 357
#note ... good thing I didn't want that one anyway!
>Dave: EOV 1L .EVO +24 332
#note No 80's band will help you now, Dave :)
>Randi: AABCLQR F14 Q. +31 388
#note Would have liked to do something fancier, but at least this takes out the line there. And doesn't get me stuck with the 	Q. 
>Dave: EILRTUV B7 RIVULET +66 398
>Randi: AABCLRS 14J BA.LS +38 426
#note Well I missed BERASCAL, largely because I didn't know it. I tried to get down from the E to this spot, but I couldn't find anything. This puts me out next turn for sure, though.
>Dave: DFKM 5K D..F +22 420
#note He didn't trust KOFF, which I appreciate, because I didn't know it.
>Randi: ACR C13 ARC +14 440
#note Aaaand I'm so relieved that I'm going to win this that I miss that it will triple. I should pay more attention to things like that.
