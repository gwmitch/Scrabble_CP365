>Eman: ADNR 5G ..NDAR +32 55
#note should have exchanged OQ last turn!
>Josh: AENOORS 4H .OONER +27 64
#note hoped to get a challenge from Eman on this new word, and/or hoped to be able to pluralize while he wouldn't be able to. We were kibitzing after he let this go and I told him that it was a word after he said "nice phony".

>Josh: ?ELNOOS J7 LOON.ESt +59 148
#note Not much was going well at this point. I was unlikely to win, BOONERS* was unlikely to occur, and I had to play a bingo for less than 70 points! 1st division problems, I guess. L8 cON(S)OLES is 7 more, but allows him to score 7 more as well, but for the sake of board shape, I need to keep things open for bingos, and cON(S)OLES probably accomplishes that better than LOONIEST.
>Eman: JTU 2M JUT +30 199
>Josh: ADELNRX 12A AXLED +31 179
#note I have nothing to say about this turn. JUT bothered me and must have thrown me far off course for me to have made such a horrendous blunder.

>Eman: ?EEIKLT N4 sLEEKIT +72 300
>Eman: ?EEIKLT --  -72 228
#note At least Eman was not thinking straight either.
>Josh: AEEIRRU 8J .URARI +21 304
#note I realized I couldn't block everything, so I decided to block (T)EnTLIKE and score. I should have thought longer and realized that U(T)ERI O1 was better, but I had somehow mishit the clock earlier and lost like 6 minutes.
>Eman: ?EEIKLT E3 sLEEKIT +80 308
>Josh: AACEEWZ N6 WA.EZ +45 349
>Eman: BF M7 F.B +31 339
>Josh: ACEIOST O10 ASCITE +44 393
#note This had to be the play, right? Whoa! ASCITES does not lose the S. WHOA! I MISSED ECTO(P)IAS and should have blown this game too. Although if ASCITE is challenged off, I will probably end up seeing ECTO(P)IAS, which is stupid!
>Eman: HIMNSTV L11 .MITH +28 367
#note Emanuel missed a really cool play here in 12J (E)THNI(C). But the best play is 2F SH(T)UM+, which I'm sure he wasn't familiar with. -9
>Josh: EGIOTY 1G GY.O +30 423
#note I'm supposed to stick him with his V, but we didn't have time for that. And this is best because he challenged!
