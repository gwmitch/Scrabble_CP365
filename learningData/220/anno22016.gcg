>Josh: ?ENORRY 7A ONERY +21 21
#note I missed ORANGERY and CRAYONER, two words I was unfamiliar with, and HERONRY, which I just didn't know. I did see it as a possibility, but no way I'm playing a word I'm not 100% of so early with 5-point challenge. 9B RORY# is better
>Andrew: EIVV D7 ..VIVE +24 90
>Josh: ?IMORUW 13B WORM +31 52
#note Considered this and VROUW. VROUW could be better due to its leave, but I think in Collins I should take the 9 points.
>Andrew: COX 14A COX +43 133
#note Wow. This was a crazy volatile play, as HO or HE plays at 15A will often be left open for a prolonged period of time. I hoped he didn't have an H already.
>Josh: ?EGINTU I2 GUNITEs +66 118
#note Oy, I missed H1 TEGUmIN(A). I didn't look for long enough, as I had lost a lot of time on my first turn.
>Andrew: ENZ 10B ZE.N +33 166
>Josh: IJKLLPU 4G LI.KUP +26 144
>Josh: AAEJLLS (challenge) +5 149
#note I hoped JUNKPILL* wasn't Collins or something. Challenged.

#note No open B, aw...
>Andrew: IMNNOTU 5D MUNIT.ON +104 301
#note He thanked me for blocking MOUNTIN(G), as he would not have seen this otherwise. Also of note, (A)NTIMUON# H8.
>Josh: AELLSTW 4A WALE +30 209
#note Welp, two Collins bingos in and out of my head during this annotation. SETWALL# and SWALLET#. I imagined there was something. :#(
>Andrew: ABNR A1 BRA.N +30 331
>Josh: CEFLSTT 14E EFT +18 227
#note ALEF takes a T in this lexicon. :/ This was a tilty* play. 3A ALEF was definitely better, and I saw it.
>Andrew: EFHIS H12 FISH +49 380
#note he said he also considered HE at that hotspot I was talking about earlier.
>Josh: ?ACDLST M2 CASTLeD +81 308
>Andrew: AEGITU L8 AUGITE +20 400
>Josh: BDIIOOT K11 BIO +22 330
#note dunno what to hope for here. Either a bingo or the H, but I don't think I can hope for an S after AUGITE. BITO# in the same spot might be better but I don't want to interfere with the H.
>Andrew: ADPQRSY G7 Q. +21 421
>Josh: ADEIOTY 15B OYE +26 356
#note My thought process was very complex here. I considered that I would either have to hit a huge HOY or HEY at 15A or a huge bingo to win. That was the simple part. The difficult part was assessing what Andrew's range was after QI. It just seemed that he didn't have the H. Given how unlikely it was for me to win, I decided that I should pull for a bingo down from N8 or from the H in FISH, and that should be enough to win in some scenarios. The pool looked decent for that avenue, but I think the more I look at it the more 15C YOD makes sense instead. Two D's left for (AD)D and lots of consonants. YOD can win a certain amount of the time, since I'm blocking plays at 15A and there is really nowhere else to score well. OATY might also be correct at 15C, as it scores more, and every point counts if I want to win. But after the game, I thought that I should have played off OE somewhere, probably at B6 or with E(C)O at L2. This bizarre play would be a fish for the H as well as a fish for an unlikely (H)YDATIDS at H15 for 101 points. If I play ECO to distract Andrew and then HYDATIDS after HE, we tie (!), but if I play OE for 2 more, I win by 2 after I get 22 from his rack! That's 12-42+101+22. So that may work. If instead I draw the H, I can play HEY for 77 next turn, which isn't sufficient it would seem, although perhaps I can win if it's part of an out-in-two after Andrew makes a weak fish next turn. What OYE did that I didn't realize is that it set up H(OYE)D#, so this was the worst of any of the plays blocking the hotspot I could make. 

In conclusion, it seems that I have to either score and hope for the H, as the spot is impossible to block, but I also need to retain my Y for maximum points, so I actually can't really score, so that route doesn't work. The best route to take would be to go for a bingo, and it seems OATY or YOD at 15C accomplish that best. 
>Andrew: DDEEERS G14 .E +7 428
#note Quackle suggests the same fish Andrew made, but at 2H instead, for the possibility of (H)AEREDES with an A draw. I was hoping that he would make a fish with 8L (AD)D if he had both eses (which he didn't), so that I could respond with G(ADD)I. That's because I also needed to hope that H(OYE)D# was a word.
>Josh: ADGHIPT 15A H...D +63 419
>Josh: UNKNOWN (challenge) +5 424
#note I realize Quackle doesn't have the new words for CSW15 yet... Guess this annotation may be missing a few things! I saw his rack, missed DRESSED (I was obviously subconsciously hoping he had nothing anyway), but decided to try this. I have to block his bingo obviously, but maybe he doesn't see it... Challenged unsuccessfully, but all I gain is 5 points, which are nothing compared to what is to come.
