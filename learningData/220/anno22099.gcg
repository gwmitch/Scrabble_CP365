#note He told me this was his rack after the game. I slightly prefered JILL, but Lloyd and Quackle liked NINJA a hair more.

#note As a relative underdog in this game, I like how PERDUE makes this a race to bingo in the 14 row.

>Lloyd_Mills: AEIMRTU 15M MUT +21 331
#note Lloyd and I discussed this turn quite a bit after the game. He loses most of the time to X plays at 15M so he wants to address that spot. I didn't notice this until now, but ITEM seems to do the same thing but way better. Q hates both choices and, predictably, wants him to fish. 
>Matt_: ?EINRVZ 2I .VZoNE +50 357
#note If I just play VIZ(O)R like my gut said, I win this game (although I should after this play, too!!!) But I got scared that I was missing something huge and decided to play this instead. I didn't see his EX(E)DRA play, but I did see (E)XEDRA, which I blocked with this. 
>Lloyd_Mills: ABDEIRX 10I EX.DRA +37 368
>Matt_: IR M4 .IR +3 360
#note Oh jeez. IR(E) at E13 is the game-winning play. I didn't see it over the board and Lloyd didn't mention it. Dang, that's awful. 
>Matt_:  (BI) +8 368
