>Randi: AGHNSTX 8G HANG +16 16
#note i already don't know what to do... help!
>Jenn: LLOT F8 TOLL +15 15
#note Lil' Miss Thang over here...
>Randi: BEFSTVX 11E F.EX +28 44
#note I also don't know what to do here. This is going swimmingly. Like when my tube swam out to sea :)
>Jenn: DQU H6 QU.D +14 29
>Randi: ABESTVY 12A BEATY +34 78
#note Seemed slightly risky given her last play, but I didn't know what else to do. 
>Jenn: ?EFNNOR 12H iNFERNO +76 105
>Randi: BDLSTUV B11 V.LD +16 94
#note I couldn't find anything to do over yonder by the fire, so I decided to create an additional spot, one for which I had two exciting hooks. Also, I didn't know what to do. :)
>Jenn: ADLNOUW 15A tTICKY +60 165
>Jenn: ADLNOUW --  -60 105
#note She was so focused on remembering that VELD took a T that she misdesignated the blank, I think. Also, now I really don't know what to do because I know that she has a blank. Eep!
>Randi: BMOSTTU 15A STUB +36 130
#note Help meeeeeee
>Jenn: CIKYZ M10 ZI.CKY +48 153
#note Oh gee golly gosh look what she missed last time. Good grief. 
>Randi: AAAMOTW 14K WA.A +22 152
#note No idea what to do whatsoever. That's kind of the theme of this game. This one in particular, I mean, though probably also crossword game as a whole. 
>Jenn: ?AGIILNT J2 TAILIN.s +62 215
>Randi: ACEMOOT 15H CAMO +29 181
>Jenn: EJNOS O8 JEONS +50 265
#note I think she may have overscored this?
>Randi: EEGIOOT 5I O.EO +8 189
#note Ugh okay this is obviously wrong but I have no idea what to do at all. I really should have traded, obviously. This blocked up the board and was terrible. 
>Jenn: ENSV 3I V.NES +24 289
#note See now I took out the I and she takes out the A and the T. I really don't know why I didn't trade last turn (or make the obvious good play that you will see and I did not). 
>Randi: EEGGIOT 9D GO. +4 193
#note Okay so now I begin this insane process of reopening the board for no points with awkward tiles. Will you still love me at the end of this game?
>Jenn: AIW 6L WAI +13 302
#note Okay so she played WAI somewhere for 24 points and I can't figure out where. I continue working on reopening, trade in a couple of turns, and eventually get a bingo down. Its painful and ridiculous. Clearly I should have traded when I played OLEO or done something else that you will tell me about... but what should I have done before that?
