>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: IIII -IIII +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: GIORTTZ H7 GOT +8 8
#note I wanted a closed board against Robin, so I thought this play accomplished that. This isn't standard, but I'm OK with it, especially after an exchange. I think ZIG would have been good too. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: BIJ G8 JIB +25 25
#note of course sometimes things don't got so much as planned...
>Joshua_Sokol: ILORTVZ 9F R..Z +23 31
#note I6 LOT looks OK, I didn't consider keeping VZ here. V(IT)RIOL is alright as well. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 25
#note I think she exchanged 7
>Joshua_Sokol: IILORTV I9 .ORIL +15 46
#note But in that case I don't think I would have played this. I think she exchanged 2 or 3 upon further reflection, so this I deemed safe enough. She was also kind of unhappy about her draw so I assumed she didn't have a 7. Maybe in that case I should play (Z)IT. Maybe in all cases I should play (Z)IT.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: DELNRSS 12H R.NDLESS +72 97
#note yup
>Joshua_Sokol: AIOPTUV N10 VI.TA +32 78
#note Here I considered two plays after looking. PIVOT(S) and VI(S)TA. PAVI(S) should have also been a consideration, and it seems a bit better than PIVOT(S) just on the merit that it doesn't allow counterscoring at N10 for my opponent. VI(S)TA reduces scoring a lot and makes having an S much more important than previously. There are two left, and Robin is a favorite to have an S, so that's not really a good thing, although given her lead she may sacrifice to block the opening if she doesn't hold an S, which is around 3/4 of the time or so I think? So yeah, also given my deficit it's going to be hard to outplay her and win at this point. VI(S)TA also blocks a ton of the right side of the board, which I don't really want. PAVI(S) or PIVOT(S) aren't much better, though... I think I like this play best, though I don't *like* anything. That'll teach me for playing ZORIL over ZIT. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: EEILNOS 15H OLEINES +83 180
#note Oh, and that too. This is probably better than the higher-scoring LESIONE(D) because of its point-reducing merits. 
>Joshua_Sokol: CLNOPUW K8 WOUN. +18 96
#note I didn't realize UNCLP bingoed around 7% next turn. That makes WO for 28 worth thinking about a bit more. I already need some sort of miracle. I think WO 14J is a better play for that need.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: DINY 8K .INDY +39 219
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIKLNP N2 PLINKE. +48 144
#note I couldn't decide which of PLINKE(D) or CLINKE(D) was most likely to be valid. I decided it was PLINKE(D) and that the U hook it set up was also a plus. It's good! So is CLINKE(D), but I was sure of neither.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: ?AACDEF E9 FACADEs +91 310
>Joshua_Sokol: ACFRUWY 1L WAUR +48 192
#note I'm not sure if this was actually my rack. It probably wasn't but it was a rack similar to this one in which my highest score was with WAUR and I had a clunky leave. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: AENO 15A AEON. +15 325
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDEFMY 13C FA.DY +34 226
#note this was probably my rack too. I was unsure of FA(D)DY too but I'm 2/2 this game with maybe phony word attempts, which is in stark contrast with annotated game 18487 in which I go on a phonying rampage against the same opponent cause I thought each word was good. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: EU 11E .UE +18 343
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEMST 5H CASEME.T +74 300
#note A breath of hope!
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: IORT H1 TORI. +24 367
#note What is she doing?! This would seem to facilitate a full comeback for me... She said she kept AIO or some other 3 vowels.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IOQUVX -V +0 300
#note This was a really really interesting turn though. I noticed that I could play QUOt(A) at 12A for 53, but that didn't seem like nearly enough to mount a full comeback. Perhaps it is in a lot of scenarios? VIX looked extremely unpromising. So I felt I needed to get rid of the V somehow. What better way to do that than to exchange and fish for a 1/3 shot at drawing into an awesome bingo? Robin didn't seem like she was in a hurry to close things down, even after a very fishy play, and if she did decide to overlap TORIC next turn, it would sacrifice points and leave most of the time and I would still have great scoring options. This seemed like my best shot, but perhaps the more standard (N)IX(E) is the right play at J12. (This was a fish for QUIXO(T)ES, QUIXO(T)IC and QUIXOT(R)Y.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: AEGIOPR 3C PROGE.IA +76 443
#note But a fourth bingo ruins my chances of ever mounting a comeback, and as Robin said, she had held 3 vowels before this play. Even she said that this was lucky. No matter, I should never have played (Z)ORIL, especially with the tells I received from my opponent. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIOQUX 1C QUIXO.Es +74 374
#note At least I hit it... :P No use in trying to win this game, it's over. 
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: BEHHMTV 6J HM +32 475
#note Mistracking, Robin begins a false endgame. This is but 2 points back though, luckily enough.
>Joshua_Sokol: AGT L1 .AG +7 381
#note This, though, even with perfect tracking, is 4 back. I thought that her best play was J2 HE, so I wanted to block it. I should instead play 12D T(A), blocking other plays and threatening GA(M) for 12, or vice-versa.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: BEHTV 12B BET. +21 496
#note correct!
>Joshua_Sokol: T G3 .T +4 385
>Joshua_Sokol:  (HV) +16 401
#note Choke number 3 complete.
