#note exch P. I also didn't know PITMAN on PITMEN. Also confused EINT and AENT. -10ish
>Josh: NOQU 8E QUO.N +14 14
>Carl_Johnson: AEEFNTU E8 .UATE +28 42
#note I might want to play QUEEN to prevent extensions. In any case QUEAN looks better than QUATE in terms of point giveaways and leave value. 
>Josh: CEEIINS 11A NICE.IES +68 82
>Carl_Johnson: EFNOSTU A8 FOU.T +27 69
#note I think I should play this over fishing so Carl's score doesn't get out of reach
>Josh: DNT 12D D.NT +20 102
>Carl_Johnson: AEELNNS F10 N..E +10 79
#note EN or NE/E(QUATE) look a bit better than this

#note Why do I do these things? This would be high prob and I've never seen it in my life

>Carl_Johnson: AEIMOSX 8M .AX +30 191
#note L3 MAXI scores a bunch and doesn't really give anything back, so I think that may be a bit better. I didn't like AXIOM L1 cause of what it gave back.
>Josh: BHO 6F HOB +28 237
>Carl_Johnson: AEIJMOS 5E JO +23 214
#note Perhaps I play L11 (R)IOJA. I didn't want to take out any lanes, which is why JOE/EQUATE was not a consideration for too long, despite its benefits relating to leave+score
>Josh: GHU N4 UGH +27 264
>Carl_Johnson: AEEIIMS L11 .EI +13 227
#note again 7B AMIE doesn't make sense to me. Anything else I missed?
>Josh: GIZ L3 ZIG +29 293
>Carl_Johnson: AEIMNST 3I MAI.ES +48 275
#note I didn't want to play a bingo that didn't score much and/or and gives back a ton. I felt like my deficit was too large for that to actually work. I also wanted to open up the board a bit and reduce scoring opportunities for Carl. I felt that MAIZES did that pretty well. I also felt like my leave was much much better than nothing. I estimated it at something like +10 given the pool. But I only bingo around 15% all things considered after this play, and there are too many tiles to draw, so even though it's very very likely he doesn't have the S after ZIG, MAIZES doesn't score enough to be worth it. INMATES opens up another scoring spot, so I have a much better shot at winning after that.

#note And yet, I luck out enormously. 
>Josh: ADILRY 15G ARIDLY +44 370
>Carl_Johnson: BDGLRVV B13 V.V +9 365
#note I didn't have any vowels here but I forgot to write down my full rack. I was blocking easy points at 15A but E(V)E or O(V)A is still way too many. 
>Josh: AEEEOOP O7 O.O +10 380
#note blocking (A)RB. He thought he still had E(V)E for free.
>Carl_Johnson: BDGILRR D14 .D +5 370
#note not knowing B(ED)R(I)D cost me a lot of spread here, but still, no wins. This is 14 points back.
>Josh: AE 10H .EA. +15 395
>Carl_Johnson: BGILRR -  +0 370
#note I wasn't sure this was valid so I challenged, since it looked like, with Carl's time trouble and all, I had a shot at a win.
