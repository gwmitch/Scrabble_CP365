#note J: Lest I forget in the future.  JOTTY doesn't compare, JUTTY is only a verb, and JETTY compares AND is a verb.
>Will: HHIIINR L3 HI. +16 215
#note W: Interesting decision here - not sure whether I should play GHI C1 and force Joey to find TUTTIES - I suppose it's worth the two points to find out. I figured he was a lock to see it/be sure of it.

#note W: I guess BUHR is a lot more points. IIIN is so horrendous and the H could score okay at 2F sometimes, but not often enough.

#note W: Another pivotal play. I missed ECHINI but luckily for me it's probably best to keep some vowels so CHIN seems about as good or better. However, I did not appreciate the beauty of I11 ZINC here. Because of the C out in space there, it's impossible to block every lane except possibly by playing through the C, which would score next to nothing and use up precious vowels and mostly lead to easy-to-win endgames. Joey playing from the C with a six letter word to the DWS would also be bad, but he might not have a great play like that with only three vowels left. If he has the other blank and spends it to play with ZINCs/ZINCy I get a crack at the N to win the game and with a 1C/2V leave and a slew of good bingo tiles available it's a pretty good bet that I have something available.

#note W: Had I played ZINC I would now have RAIDERs and REoRDAI(N) here. Darn. Not only that, but I have a tying sequence - tRAD 12G. This is better than gRAD in the same spot even though both of them set up (ZA)IRE for the win. This is because after gRAD, Joey can block ZAIRE with (ZA)Ny and I won't be able to go out with IRE. After tRAD I guarantee myself two outs. Had I made the right pre-endgame play I wouldn't have had to find this sequence anyway :(
