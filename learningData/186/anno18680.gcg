>Cheryl_Tyler: AEOT H6 TOEA +8 8
#note Round 1, I show up late (huge surprise), find I've lost two minutes on my clock, and my eye is already hurting (I have eyestrain issues, and at some point during the previous week in Toronto, I'd strained my eye, despite hardly being on the computer at all. If you're wondering why I now wear glasses sometimes, now you know.
>dacrON: DDHIMPR 7E DIM.RPH +19 19
>Cheryl_Tyler: INOY I9 YONI +20 28
>dacrON: ?DEHIRW H12 HIED +45 64
#note Classic first round jitters for me. I would've played WH(I)RrIED, had I known it, but I opted for this over WHIrRED, which seems somewhat silly, in hindsight. The W isn't a very good tile for bingoing, and it's usually only worth passing up a perfectly good bingo if you're going to bingo next turn - hence the sacrifice now for benefits later.
>Cheryl_Tyler: ?BEIORV 14A OVERBIt. +78 106
>dacrON: ?ELLRSW L7 SWiLLER +92 156
#note I debated SWeLLER as I didn't think it took an S, but then I got scared and thought maybe it did and I'd lose a turn.

>dacrON: AAFGOVY 8L .AVY +39 219
#note I thought about G9 FAVA to set up OY, but I didn't think it would increase my average score much, especially when I am sacrificing 6 points now. I also save FAG or FOG for next turn, and could re-set-up a vowel at 10F. Quackle says it's close, with an ever so slight preference to FAVA.

>dacrON: CGINOTX 10B COX +44 295
#note There is no reason to keep ING here. Take the 6 extra points, make the (AY) hook useless, and shut off the board that way. ING should only be kept if it will help you score more. It will help me bingo more, but when I don't bingo, I will score less, especially when I now need to shut off the board.

>Cheryl_Tyler: ISS 14J SIS +31 297
>dacrON: DNNOUUZ K3 NUDZ. +36 357
#note Not crazy about opening the board, but at this point, I pretty much need to.
>Cheryl_Tyler: AERT L2 RATE +17 314
>dacrON: AENOOUU 1L UNAU +21 378
#note (K)O(R)U(N)A is gorgeous, but it's pretty hard for me to lose after UNAU, especially with the bag consonant heavy.
>Cheryl_Tyler: EJRR O4 JERR. +23 337
>dacrON: BEEFGOO M3 BEEF +35 413
>Cheryl_Tyler: GILMOSU G9 MUG +20 357
#note MIG nets three more points next turn, as it saves (K)O(R)U(N).

>dacrON:  (ILO) +6 444
#note Cheryl played a very nice game to start the tournament - I just has a bit more firepower in COX and NUDZH.
