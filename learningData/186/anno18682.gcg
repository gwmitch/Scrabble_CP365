#note Matthew: "We meet again. Please don't beat me by 1 point and take my cat. I sure hope your vowelitis curse is still afflicting you."
>Nigel_Richards: ??EEIOU F2 EUlOgI.E +58 58
#note Nigel: "Haha! I am still cursed! But watch as my vowels do not hinder me from bingoing! Kitty will be mine!!"
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EILOPRS D5 PRE.OILS +74 94
#note Oh wait, this is a real game.
>Nigel_Richards: BDGIR 2A BRIDG. +20 78
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IIRRSTU -IRU +0 94
#note I missed A2 BRUIT which looks perfectly worthwhile. LIRI blocking all my bingo lines and keeping the U felt not worth the 8 points. I would definitely have taken BRUIT if I'd seen it (mistake), but still value the exchange above a lot of other plays.
>Nigel_Richards: DTZ C1 D.TZ +28 106
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IRRSSTW 9C W.R. +13 107
#note I admit I succumbed to Nigel scaredness here, as I decided there was a chance the superioir PROW was CSW. WORE is a little worse.
>Nigel_Richards: AHPU C9 .HAUP +35 141
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IIRSSTT 5D .R.TISTS +40 147
#note Time to take the points, I think. Though STIR G2 and IBIS A1 are just as good. IBIS is the mindreader's preference.

>Nigel_Richards: EIJU 1G JUI.E +42 246
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEFLOTU C6 OF +20 236
#note Maybe K8 FOUL? This seems fine
>Nigel_Richards: AGLV 3I V.GAL +26 272
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AELNNTU 8J .LUANT +21 257
#note This play takes me forever to see and I let my time dip to under 5 minutes with still plenty of turns to go. Luckily, Nigel doesn't start fast playing me. Quackle prefers 4J CAN by a couple points. Bingo chances and points blocking. Makes sense, but ELUANT is good too
>Nigel_Richards: AFTW 4L WAFT +34 306
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEHINOY O1 YEN.E +24 281
#note Now I start bleeding points to time pressure. HONEY is a clear 4-5 point favourite. I'm crumbling here!
>Nigel_Richards: DENO 7H DO.EN +17 323
#note Nice blocking play.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GHIIMNO N1 OH +25 306
#note 4H HIC a better version of this play. This was a pretty sloppy game from me, thanks to spending forever on the RRSTIIU rack (still missing BRUIT), and the LNNTAEU rack.
>Nigel_Richards: ANQR O8 .RANQ +24 347

#note A miracle!!
