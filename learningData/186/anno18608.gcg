#note This is a semi-weird play, throwing the board wide open. Possibly a corrolary of having drawn so poorly, hoping to get a blank finally. I took about 7 minutes here, trying to decide if a play like this was justified. My reasoning is that 1) I'm really only opening up a big S hook and medium E lanes, as the B and G are weak lanes, the R is already available. The immediate lanes aren't that threatening. 2) I'm grabbing 6 tiles with 2 blanks unseen, instead of many alterative plays (FUB) only grabbing 2. I'm also going for the Z which Jeff doesn't have (otherwise ZEE atop SWART). 3) My other options kinda suck. RE(F)UGE opens a big lane and leaves the clunky BP, and BU(R)GER scores fewer and opens an S lane. All in all I was happy with AUBERGE at this score - up 54 is not that safe of a lead so I have to keep scoring points! Sims best, but in a different universe I might have preferred FUB or PURGE/PEH, as I have a chance to start locking down the board here if Jeff doesn't open it soon.

#note O(R)PINE is a sweet overlap and closes the board! The small mistakes are really hurting me this tourney. EINO is a strong leave with 11v 26c in the pool, but I'm also opening a lane on the other side of the board which is bad considering that ORPINE is available.

>Rafi: EEINOOT D12 EON +15 265
#note Wanted to play TOONIE to go for the blanks, but EON semi-blocks the highest scoring lane and EIOT is solid with 8v 24c unseen, including NNNNRRRSS and a blank. TOONIE and E(B)ONITE sim about even with EON.

#note OOOOH ZAPATEO for 36 is cool. I really wanted to play ABOIL to block the best lanes, but I couldn't justify opening a double-double and scoring only 11, especially with EON-S also available. Thought of OBELI after the game, which is perhaps better than ABOIL? I figured my bingo chances were quite high after OD, but in fact they are only 46%. Another problem with ABOIL is the pool - 6v 20c. I was worried about playing ABOIL, getting bingoed on, and drawing 4 consonants and no blank. My poor picking has jaded me this tourney. ABOIL is totally fine... I block the biggest threat and give myself 4 chances at the blanks, and I can withstand even a lucky double-double if I draw ok! Big mistake, and I should have seen ZAPATEO also. I could have also played TABLOID! That was probably the play... 6 tiles while leaving a precious vowel. DAMN. Stupid play. TABLOID is the play.

#note Blocking the best line. I should be fine with a blank draw!

#note (R)E(E)NACToR making NEON is so cool.
>Rafi: AAEKLST 14F KA +34 351
#note I can withstand a lot here, but not a bingo. AKELA/AR is better though... I block the bingos and force Jeff to outscore me with an out-in-two. I should have thought for longer. Terrible play. No reason not to try to induce a mistake! Jeff bingos 35% after KA, and there really aren't many AKELAS plays that can hurt me. If I draw one vowel and have an outplay, Jeff is in big trouble!
