#note This isn't quite as bad, but I can't see why I didn't do H12 YEAR here. I know I wanted to get some action going in the upper left quadrant, but YEAR opens up too.

#note I thought AIRTING would make it easier to bingo again than TRAIKING would, but 7 points is too much. I don't think I counted. Playing very lazily in this game.
