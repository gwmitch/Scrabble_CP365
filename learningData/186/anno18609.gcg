#note Cool
>Rafi: EHINRUW E3 WHINE. +30 76
#note Wasn't 100%, but I was pretty confident when I played this. However, ERU is quite an improvement over RU, so WHINY may be better anyway. Draws a challenge.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: HNOY -  +0 62
>Rafi: DGIORRU 6B ROU.DI.G +16 92
#note ROUGH gave up too much on an otherwise unfriendly board. DIR isn't going to bingo enough to merit opening a big spot.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: HNOY 10F HO.NY +27 89
>Rafi: AEEIQRS 9C QI +30 122
#note First put down QI/HI to set up a bingo lane, but decided it wouldn't stay open enough (plus I don't have great tiles for underlapping HI). Keeping the board tight with a lead is nice as well.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BEL 3B BLE. +18 107
>Rafi: AAEEORS 4E .AO.E +8 130
#note Frustration is really setting in. Feeling like no matter what I do I cannot draw a bingo. I wanted to play TOEA but it gives back so much that I couldn't pull the trigger, especially with Terry seeming confident about her rack. TOEA sims best, but I don't necessarily agree here.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: CIS 10B CIS +32 139
>Rafi: AEEEIRS 3H .AERIE +23 153
#note More frustration. At least I have a nice dump!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BDEK L2 B.KED +24 163
>Rafi: AAESTVV 11J AVA +17 170
#note The ultimate frustration here. VV??? Can I catch a break? Keep in mind that my last bingo was 3 games ago. Quackle prefers keeping it closed with VAST/FAERIES by 1%.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?DEMNTU N1 DUsTMEN +81 244
#note Scored as 91, which I didn't notice. As Cesar would say, -10.
>Rafi: ?AEOSTV O7 AVOSETs +82 252
#note Not keen on playing SOLVATE with the Z unseen.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AIJOPRU 13J RIOJA. +24 268
#note Terry originally put down JAUPs but changed her mind.
>Rafi: AFGNPTW A6 GNAW +36 288
#note Missed GAWP. Played this immediately, but I had a few minutes to find GAWP as Terry took awhile on RIOJAS. Preferred GNAW over WAFT as it scores more and the F is strong on this board.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: GPU 9J PUG +14 282
>Rafi: EFOOPRT 2J FO. +31 319
#note FOR is simming best, as it blocks bingos and gives me nice overlap potential with things like TEMP. Few unseen tiles go after JO here!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ADEINRT 14E ANTIRED +69 351
#note :/
>Rafi: AELOPRT D2 O. +2 321
#note If I knew I was down only 32 instead of 42, I might have played PLEAT which could win. I was hoping for an O draw and something really ridiculous. PROLATE and no ZOIC + a botched block? I ran out of time trying to conjure a win.
