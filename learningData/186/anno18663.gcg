>Joshua_Sokol: BBFGIPR -BBFGIP +0 0
#note Game one! This was the most controversial game of the whole tournament. If I were a good tournament player, whatever happened this game wouldn't have happened. 

I could have played FRIG here, but BBP is just disgusting. I think it's close between FRIG and the exchanges. And what exchange do I make if I exchange? PR has good synergy and I considered it, but it goes wrong when I draw a few consonants. Keeping R is safer, but it could also go wrong with a ton of one-pointer draws. And keeping IPR is the most bingo-friendly leave, but the tiny negative aspect of IPR is that it doesn't go for SSSS?? as much as the other exchanges. It's extremely close here; I think either of the 3 exchanges are valid, and it isn't worth it to think about them all too much.
>Jim_Burlant: ALMOO 8D MOOLA +20 20
>Joshua_Sokol: CIRRUUY G6 RU.Y +12 12
#note I wasn't 100% on CURIU(M) here and failed to consider (M)URRY. I saw CURI(O) and hated the leave, but it's not much worse than CIRU. CURIU(M) is obviously the play here. -10 or something. :/
>Jim_Burlant: ENOX 9B OXEN +25 45
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACIIRU F2 CURIA +19 31
#note My first bailout rack of the tournament AND my first turn in which I missed a 9! A(ME)RICIUm would have been fantastic to see and draw a challenge on. I almost chickened out on this word. 
>Jim_Burlant: ITZ 5C ZIT. +26 71
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADIRSV B7 AV.DIReS +80 111
#note VIzARDS or VIzARDS at I2 keep the board bereft of bingo opportunities for my opponent, yet only but me 30 points ahead. I thought that taking extra points here was a better route to take, since if I draw badly next turn, I'm not necessarily in trouble if I'm 40 ahead rather than 30. 
>Jim_Burlant: BEH 4D HE.B +30 101
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AHNOOR A11 HONOR +38 149
#note A1 HARpOON is a bingo. 2B cOAN(C)HOR is also a bingo. CORONACH is the anagram of COANCHOR. So for this turn I learned a new word, and sunk lower on the blank bingo finding scale. Not that this was a huge mistake. Rather that I need to see HARPOON on my rack. 
>Jim_Burlant: EMW C11 MEW +37 138
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADLOUY H1 DULY +53 202
>Jim_Burlant: QT 7A Q.T +13 151
#note Jim and I both agreed that this was a mistake, postgame. He needed to leave A1 open for himself and his leave actually wasn't that strong. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AACEIO H8 .ECIA +13 215
#note I played this because I remembered AECIAL as being invalid, but also cause Jim's leave seemed very strong and so I wanted to take out the only 7 lane on the board. But this donates a few more 8 lanes to Jim's bailout fund anyways, and 3C AA exists. 
>Jim_Burlant: II -II +0 151
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEOTTW 10D TOW +22 237
>Jim_Burlant: ABGN 3A BANG +21 172
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEETT I1 ETA +12 249
#note Now in completely opposite logic to last turn, I decide to block 8 lanes and provide a new 7 lane for Jim. TA(B) is a good play here.

Oh, and I miss CATENATE and write down CATERATE*.

Oh, and I OVERDRAW. Very fortunately for me he sees ITE and throws away the T, missing the S I just drew and the blank I've been holding due to having missed bingos earlier on. 
>Jim_Burlant: EIINNPS J3 PINNIES +66 238
#note So to add trainwreckage to this game, while I overdraw he lays down PINNIES, so I hold him before we do the overdraw procedure, and once the procedure is over, I breathe an invisible sigh of relief while S? are still on my rack and decide that I'll challenge this word I have never seen before. Apparently it's a normal word and means the same thing as the more obscure PINAFORE, which I obviously knew as a Scrabble word only. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEIIS -  +0 249
#note My lead is shattered
>Jim_Burlant: DEKP 11G P.KED +24 262
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEEIIS 13A ...IE +7 256
#note So now I don't have any lanes, which would have been fine had I safeguarded my lead. I need to play I(D)EA at K10 this turn, but this is fine, and much better than I think it is, cause.
>Jim_Burlant: ALV 13H LAV +15 277
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEIST -  +0 256
#note I challenge AECIAL as I thought I would from the start of the game. I didn't want to start doubting myself after unsuccessfully challenging PINNIES, even though AECIAL did look like a word. I remembered AECIA on zyzzyva as not taking any hooks, so at least I'm consistently wrong. 
>Jim_Burlant: GJ B2 J.G +22 299
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEIST K10 I.EA +12 268
#note Now it seems I made the right play, although K13 AA looks interesting too. 
>Jim_Burlant: FOU K4 FOU +23 322
#note Damn, now he's more likely to have the other F too. Outscoring doesn't appear possible unless he goes over. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALRSST K10 ....L +6 274
#note But perhaps outscoring is still possible if I play something like L2 LAST or D12 S(I)LT, because they both also threaten bingos... I don't really know how to measure what the right play might be here. Quackle doesn't either really. But it seems that LAST is the right play. This is too easily blockable. 
>Jim_Burlant: E I13 .E +2 324
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGRSST 5J ..G +4 278
#note At what point to I try to outscore rather than bingo? A good player should be able to block just about everything here. His clock is quite low, though.
>Jim_Burlant: DORT L7 TROD +9 333
#note Jim takes a while to play this and goes over by around 53 seconds. It is a good block.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AFRSST 15K STAfF +31 309
#note So this is -2 to L12 TSAR. My priority was to make him lose 7 more seconds and tie or win.
>Jim_Burlant: EEIN 8L .EIN +12 345
#note 14M NEE or 14K (L)INE work. Jim falls to -1:00, to my delight. 
>Joshua_Sokol: RS D12 S.R +14 323
>Joshua_Sokol:  (E) +2 325
#note So we look at his clock (-1:00) and I say: so that's -20, and the final score is 325-325. Jim agrees, and stresses the fact that he could have played one second faster and won. I say that this game wasn't his to win, that I was really unhappy to have had to settle for the tie. We sign the sheet, neither of us asks for a recount, and we send the sheet in.

It seemed that Jim was not aware of the fact that -1:00 is still only -10 points. I certainly was not, and had been playing with -1:00 as -20 for as long as I can remember. Later on he realizes our mistake somehow and tries to get the director to review the game. When I realize what had happened, it makes me feel like an idiot and a terrible person. Just 5 seconds of thinking about the situation and the idea that -1:00 should be -20 makes no sense whatsoever. So we both try to get the directors to review the decision, in vain. What a catastrophe to start things off, and perhaps it played a role in what was to come in terms of my results...
