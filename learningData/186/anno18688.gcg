#note I hate playing VILL here, as I want an open board against this particular opponent. I guess I could play VILL with the second L on the star.

#note Bad play. All the A's are unseen, so I really like the DELT leave, but I can score more points and leave the N open with G(I)ED for 17. E(R)G(O) has the highest bingo percentage as it opens up a great lane, but it also scores only 9. DOGE is another decent option. I need more points and/or better bingo lanes here... GONE is lacking in both categories.

#note Maybe save the L because there are no L's unseen? So gross.

#note Not sure what to do here, and pretty demoralized. I know Roy is likely to go out of his way to block, so it seemed like a good idea to keep a strong bingo leave but to ultimately go for a big Z play to get within striking range so that I only need one bingo to win instead of two. ADZ/ADZE score 49 and 55!
