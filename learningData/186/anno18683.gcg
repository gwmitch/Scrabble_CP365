>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AFNOOSU K8 .OOF +18 18
#note Various placements for OAF do well in the sim. 7L OAF is pretty solid. But it was maybe too soon to force the issue. Not a fan of 7H OAF.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AILORRT L4 ROIL. +16 177
#note Eh. I hate this rack. How often will TAILORER* fly? I say not very often. 10A ARIL and ROIL both sim pretty high, which is a sign that this is a crappy position to be in. ROILY sims equal to those and feels much more sane

#note Getting lucky to match Chris's explosive start.

>Chris_Sykes: BDN 5K B.ND +14 278
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAAEIUY 1E YAU.IA +9 300
#note Chris overdrew on BOND and I tossed the case S back into the bag (letting him keep CE). It helped my breathe easier with the BONDS spot open. AURAE and AUREI sim a point or two ahead of this. I guess because the Y is going to help me score points in a tight game.
>Chris_Sykes: ?ACJK O1 JACKs +73 351
#note After the game, Chris was upset that his overdraw forced him to burn a blank that would have been very useful later on. I point out that, without the overdraw, he may not have had the tiles to make this play at all. Incidentally: JACKS has a lot of extensions that I do not know.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEOPTU 2A POUTED +38 338
#note With the vowel-heavy pool, I'm definitely not going to go for a bingo. Let's hope he's got crap. I completely missed AUTOED. AUTOED scores 4 less and slots a scary A in the triple lane. But look at the unseen pool. There are almost no scoring tiles. So putting the A there is not a big deal, and keeping the P on my rack most certainly is. I think this is a big error and Quackle agrees. Take a drink for -10 equity loss.

>Chris_Sykes: EE 12L E.E +12 379
#note dunno what his rack is, but this is definitely his best play
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEGOOT N7 TOEA +15 423
#note Best, it seems. Need to block EERIEST, but still lose to RETIREES if S in in the bag.
>Chris_Sykes: EEEIRST O8 RETES +41 420
#note I knew full well this was phony but I'm just going to take my win
