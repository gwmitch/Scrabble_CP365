>Joshua_Sokol: AFIIRRT 9E FIAR +24 24
#note TRIF(O)RIA! A new word! I was about to play FAIR but I noticed it took a Y hook so FIAR seemed a bit better. Hilarity ensues? This is twice now.
>David_Whitley: ?AAILSS I7 AsSAILS +79 107
#note David must have noticed his bingo played after FAIR and when I switched he noticed it still played.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEILRT 13C LEERIE.T +68 92
>David_Whitley: BY 10F BY +34 141
#note when he played that I asked "Is that even allowed?"
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDRTUU 12A DUAD +24 116
#note Seems right but it sucks :/

>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIMOR 7G OG.M +24 191
#note Perhaps GEM 10B to keep the board under a bit more control.
>David_Whitley: DEEENSV 15C VENDE.SE +63 243
#note David was kicking himself for seeing this but missing the easier find, VENDEES. I held this, but I remembered it from somewhere. Great word!
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEIIRW K9 WEI. +14 205
#note Now I'm in trouble, gotta try to keep the board opened here. I had forgotten W(ASSAILS) or maybe never knew it. Playing WEIR or WEE with WASSAILS is a great idea. 
>David_Whitley: MOTT 6J MOTT +24 267
#note David also kicked himself for making this play since it made the board more open than it was. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEINR L2 CREA.INE +77 282
#note Bailed out. 
>David_Whitley: GOR 7C GOR +16 283

#note No I, scary.
>David_Whitley: IP O1 PI. +47 352
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ANOOST 6J ....O +9 367
#note I chickened out of SANTOOR. Time to review again! This wasn't a huge huge mistake but obviously I should always play the bingo
>David_Whitley: HNT M9 NTH +14 366
#note I think he has to play (N)TH at M9 given my last play?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AENOST O6 SENATOr +76 443
#note Missing SOuTANE and SANTErO under a lot of pressure.
>David_Whitley: AFHILNZ N5 Z.NA +17 383
#note If I didn't have an out 5C L(AG) is awesome, and so is (SENATOr)IAL, although they don't win the game. I think I missed my out anyways, but he blocked it with his play. -11 to H(A)IL in the same spot.

#note -1 to LI(C)H
