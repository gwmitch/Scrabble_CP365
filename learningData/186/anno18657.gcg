>Josh: ?ILOSST H7 pISTOLS +64 64
#note Before the game started, Rafi, who was sitting next to me, asked if he could draw all of my tiles for me. I said no thanks. He asked if he could just draw one, since he apparently draws well. I said "OK, fine". 

Needless to say, I drew my first 6 and Rafi pulled out a blank from the bag. Hysteria ensued, and Jesse called the director, finally just saying "OK fine, whatever, I'll allow it". 

And then I fail and I didn't play H8 SOLoIST. This was all I saw in this ridiculous moment.


>Jesse_Day: DETX 11E DET.X +26 26
>Josh: BEFINPT 10D FIB +27 91
#note I didn't see 10D BEFI(T). This is something like 5 points worse.
>Jesse_Day: AEMMSTU 13A SUMMATE. +76 102

>Josh: AILNNNU 8C ANNUL. +7 140
#note I think this is a good play, but it looks like UN(BE)N(T) is even better. I was focused on short term defense so that I could use my time better once Jesse would have to think about his next play, most likely. But I also missed UNBENT. 
>Jesse_Day: AANPRST 10H .AP +20 122
#note I blocked SPARTAN.
>Josh: CCIINUW 9J UNCI +11 151
#note He played TAP rather quickly, so it seemed his leave was pretty good. In that case I decided to block the gaping opening that he had just created instead of playing C4 WICC(A). But that's really stupid because of UNCIA... I didn't realize UNCI had that hook at the time. Another perhaps misled play.
>Jesse_Day: ANRSTZ C3 STANZ. +50 172
#note Damn u! I think he should play ZA even though he probably had another consonant. 
>Josh: CEGIOOW -ECIWOOG +0 151
#note WIGEON is a word I don't remember. K5 COIG(N)E works too. I also thought the X was still out. So this is a very bad play as 50% of the exch 7 was hoping for the X. 
>Jesse_Day: EORTV L7 VE.TOR +24 196
>Josh: EEEGNRR B9 ERE +16 167
#note Blocking GREENIER :/

This was blocking the X spot that didn't exist. 
>Jesse_Day: ACDELNR 5B C.LENDAR +72 268
#note putting my C to good use!

#note Gotta be right
>Jesse_Day: AIO 15L A.IO +18 375
>Josh: AGHHIOV 14B HAO +30 286
#note This was obviously the pivotal turn. It was my only chance to find the possibility of winning. It seemed to be between giving up and playing OGIV(E) or playing HAVI(N)G F1, and then I saw HAO. HAO gives me the possibility of drawing into B(E)HAVING, or maybe from Jesse's perspective, down at D15. But nothing was available in reality down there. So this looks like the only thing that can win. He is vowel heavy, and he hopefully decides that he can outrun the most stuff by playing down at 15D.

I thought he probably had the blank but I had to hope he didn't. This draws into B(E)HAVInG O4 in reality and outruns a lot. It scores 107!
>Jesse_Day: ADIIO 15D OIDIA +27 402
>Josh: BGHILOV O1 BILG. +30 316
#note I almost drew into it! But he did in fact have the blank, unfortunately. This is the right play, as it is the only play that guarantees me an out in 2.
>Jesse_Day: ?AEIY N9 AYs +33 435
#note Also right. Damn you Jesse!
