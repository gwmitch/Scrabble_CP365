>cesar: CDINQSU B10 QIN. +33 129
#note spent way too long on this; there's a lot of similar plays here, but SUQ J12 and N6 QUID win out. QUID seemed too easy for him to overlap or score off of, and SUQ seemed unnecessarily volatile, but my play leaves too bad of a leave. (-5)

#note oh. i guess SATAI# would still have lost to any number of UG#/TREFA# plays, but he'd have to know TREFA#. i probably shouldn't beat myself too much up for not knowing SATAI#. of course, this is decidedly lamer.
