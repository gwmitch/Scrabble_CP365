#note LIFETIME would have been helpful...I was really close to playing FILM, but wanted to go for broke for leave with the row 12 line as my target. Still, putting an E there just gets me hammered far too much for this to be worth playing.

#note As good a time for this as any...a lost challenge here would end up giving me the game, as I go out with HAO in the new spot and get a ton from AAEOSYY. Spread still kind of matters, because I can still win the tourney if I lose by small enough margins. Stefan held for quite a while and was eyeing RISTRAL* with extreme suspicion, but played it safe.
