#note Bah, first of all, GOOFY is probably a little better. KW certainly feels like a big improvement over FW. Anyway, KOTOW looks like a winner here.

#note Confused by this position...no leave is great so I should probably take points (NEIF).

#note OUTWENT is better. Little sloppy thus far.

#note I can't win any post-RAGOUTED endgame after this, so I challenged. It looked so good, but I thought it might conceivably be just PRAXES. Never a great idea to cough up that much spread, though.

#note Low on time, had the right idea couldn't tease out the right play of BEAD setting up GOUT.
