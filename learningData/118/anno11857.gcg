>Gunther_Jacobi: AAAIMNU 8D MANIA +20 20
#note Exchanging was my first idea, but I wanted to gamble.
>Dave_Johnson: BEIIT E4 TIBI.E +16 16
>Gunther_Jacobi: ACENNSU I4 NUANCES +71 91
#note Pretty good draw after leaving AU.
>Dave_Johnson: AOTU H1 AUTO +18 34
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEGOOT 8A EGO...... +42 133
#note I think some Scrabble players are this.
>Dave_Johnson: EEF J2 FEE +17 51
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELORRT D8 .ORTAR +18 151
#note I tried to convince myself RE(S)TORAL was valid. I almost layed it down twice but chickened out. Losing my mind.
>Dave_Johnson: EO 6D O.E +7 58
#note Very harsh draws for Dave here.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ELLOVVX 3J .VOLVE +24 175
#note While Dave was cogitating I was praying for an open O. (E)VOLVE wasn't an easy play to make being that I know he's very near a balanced rack with an S or a blank. But this is best.
>Dave_Johnson: EW J6 WE +28 86
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEHKLX O3 .XHALE +72 247
#note With KA---ready to roll next turn at N6.
>Dave_Johnson: AJR 7A RAJ +40 126
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEIKNT N6 KANA +38 285
#note N6 KA is preferred. AEINT is strong. This asks for a potential Z play.
>Dave_Johnson: Q G7 Q. +21 147
>Gunther_Jacobi: EIIIRRT L2 T.RII +10 295
#note Quackle likes RI(V)E N1.
>Dave_Johnson: ?BEILRS K7 BeLIERS +71 218
#note RiSIBLE 14B and many others come out ahead of this. I needed an open E.
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEHIRTW C7 ..W +27 322
#note 47.5!!! Quackle digs this!
>Dave_Johnson: FO 6A OF +31 249
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEEHIRT 12F DITHE.ER +76 398
#note Dave held. I wasn't positive.
>Dave_Johnson: PUY 14D YUP +26 275
>Gunther_Jacobi: CDGIOSS 9M G.S +23 421
#note Or G(A)D. Killing the Z.
>Dave_Johnson: DIY H12 .IDY +24 299
>Gunther_Jacobi: CDINOOS 13B CO.N +14 435
#note Going over on time as expected. DO(G) is correct at M7.

>Dave_Johnson: NZ 5K Z.N +24 323
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?DIOPSU A12 PaDI +33 468
#note DIPSOs, PSO(C)ID are the good plays. This is bad.
>Dave_Johnson: DGLMT G10 GL.M +11 334
#note At 5C is 2pts better.
>Gunther_Jacobi: OSU N12 SOU +19 487
#note And why not challenge...I go over 2 minutes. 473-340.
