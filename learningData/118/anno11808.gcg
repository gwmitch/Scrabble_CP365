#note C-Player likes the fishing move of playing off BEU, either with 10D RUBE, 11C BLUE or LUBE at K9 or 11D. A quick sim shows my play to lose about 10 points in valuation, and about five percent in winning chances (70-65). Getting rid of the U probably a big factor, as none have been played thus far, along with the powerful EHIS leave.

>Steve: ?AEFISU 6E IF +30 209
#note 6F FEU slightly better, again probably due to leave.

#note 4F KEG a little better: only two U's and the Q still unseen.

#note I thought, afterward, that this was a big mistake to try and play thru this rack. Best to exchange now, CP says to keep the M, CM, or R as first three choices, all giving an 83 percent winning chance. But a 3k simulation puts VIG on top, probably since there are few bingo opportunities on this board.
>Josh_Kopczak: ADGQRST 6B T. +4 277
>Steve: CDLMRRT 9B CR.D +11 356
#note Here is the problem with not taking the exchange last time: we are revisited with the same dilemma on whether to play or exchange, only on a more dangerous board. This time, CP likes 3J CRAM, ignoring the setup on the A file. A sim once again moves my play above CP, but just under 5J CRIT.
>Josh_Kopczak: NO 8L .ON +3 280
>Steve: ILMNPRT 13K PRINT +24 380
#note Finally, a vowel! the best play is the beautiful 14B P(AD)RI for 32. PRINT is second best and we're 96 percent to win!! Yeah, right.
>Josh_Kopczak: DE O13 .ED +12 292
>Steve: AAELMOR K4 MALE +26 406
#note Really shameful to admit I missed the A-hook at 9A, even after mentally going thru the alphabet. A4 AREOLA, or A7 ALAMO would have been nice. No excuse for not seeing MORALE at A1, however. CP likes 7G MOA, but it has to be disregarding the human factor of all the fishing that's been going on across the board. MORALE sims best.
>Josh_Kopczak: W 14B W.. +24 316
#note Scores and fishes at the same time. I had hoped to catch a Y and play MADLY here, earlier.
>Steve: AIOPRRT N12 I.RO +15 421
#note The blind spot to the hook keeps the error rate multiplying. Still, ATROPI(N) best at N2.
>Josh_Kopczak: A F13 .A +4 320
#note Drawing out the agony.
>Steve: ACNOPRT N6 CO. +11 432
#note I don't need to see the A hook anymore to guarantee a win, according to CP. M4 TOP does it, supposedly. A sim says its 99 percent.
>Josh_Kopczak: EOQSTTU A2 TOQUETS +131 451
#note Bingo. Game, set, match. This game left a mark.
>Steve: AGNPRTY B1 YAP +24 456
#note PAY in the same spot scores an extra point, and doesn't give anything back. As if it matters.
