>Leeds: ABIINNT 8D BINIT +20 20
#note Championship Player told me BINIT is better than BIN.  A 3 ply sim is entertainingly showing BIN and BINIT as very close in value, so after 3500 iterations they are still swapping places rapidly.

#note Missed a nice bingo from the B, oops!
Wanted to play INERRANT which I just learned (goes with RETIRANT and INTRANET) and then it was Blocked.  (I guess you could say it was xi-blocked.)

>Leeds: EEENRWY F10 YEW +25 59
#note Looks like WEENY would have been better for 10 points.  I am trying to pretend I'm mired in a Division 2 closed board game; of course Becky is better than that!


>Becky_Dyer: GORTU 10F .OGURT +12 62
>Leeds: AEENNRT 9I NE +8 67
#note My EN isn't an awful choice, but not the best either.  (D)EN E11 is a better implementation of the same idea, and even makes a place to play for me.  TERNA(T)E is a good 2x2, didn't see it.  Thought about GANNET and GENERA and GARNET (there's GERENT too).  Thought they weren't defensive.

>Leeds: AAEENRT C10 A.ER +18 85
#note Apparently I'm playing like a Chicken since I didn't just put AE on ZA

>Becky_Dyer: DHU 6H DUH +19 107
>Leeds: ?AEINTV L4 NATIVEs +86 171
#note Haha finally a stem bingo I can use!

>Becky_Dyer: HMW 12I WH.M +24 131
>Leeds: BDEFLOQ -QFB +0 171
#note don't remember what I kept  maybe I kept DOLE for balance or DEL probably would be an actual good thing to keep.  Seems like I kept COLE for some reason actually.

>Leeds: CEGIMOO 4H COOI.G +12 222
#note Was afraid to put O(XI)ME because then Becky could have the Y for 6F

#note Now there is no other way to reasonably avoid exchanging immediately, and exchanging tiles is the worst thing that a person can do, because Nigel Richards rarely does it, although I think I remember he once did it three times in one game!

>Becky_Dyer: APRTY 6B PARTY +38 292
>Leeds: AEIIOOU 15G OI +14 267
#note Now I am clearly losing so the only way to win is hope to become very lucky.  This is bad logic, because I should always try to improve my chances as much as possible.  Think of the Bogowin!  May the Bogowin be with you!

>Becky_Dyer: EEOPT 5A TOPEE +28 320
>Leeds: AEFIJSU 6L .AJ +26 293
#note Now I am trying hard to think as Becky is talking about how bad a play TOPEE was, discovering she has no vowels.  She did not expect me to be hoarding 7 vowels on my rack.  I am the one who started off the kibitzing and coffeehousing by commenting before I played OI, and at the end she generously forgave my 37 seconds less than zero showing on my clock.  Thank you Becky!  You play very well!
