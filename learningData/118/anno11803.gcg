#note this was dumb. I even thought it was dumb when I tried it, but the potential payoff was too huge to ignore, especially with him drawing seven.

#note another absurd two-tile draw. n4 SAINTED scores best but it pretty unsafe.

#note looks best. other moves give me better balance, especially with IT unseen but don't score as well.

#note This was the move I was interested in. It was 2/8 times. Playing off TIT wins 3/8 times, I'm assuing because it saves the O for B13. Close! 

As played (G in the bag) I can't win no matter what. That was probably the worst tile I could draw.
