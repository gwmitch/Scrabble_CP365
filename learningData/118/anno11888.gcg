>Mike_Ryan: IMNOSST 8D MONISTS +74 74
#note I kind of recognized this, but wasn't positive so I held.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACFITV F6 VI.CA +20 20
#note Maybe (M)AFIC which I forgot was a word. The simple (I)F ranks high but VI(N)CA is in the mix too.
>Mike_Ryan: AELNORY I4 ORNA.ELY +63 137
#note Ouch...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEFNOT H11 OFTEN +41 61
#note The only bingo is F(R)ONTAgE and I didn't know it. This isn't too shabby though, scoring 40+ with the blank still in hand.
>Mike_Ryan: DEELNOR 13A REDOLEN. +70 207
#note Haha. I learned this word simply because Mike played the same word against someone else.
>Matthew_Larocque: ??AAGKQ H1 QuAG +50 111
#note Nice. With a deficit this large I need all the help I can get.
>Mike_Ryan: EJLW B10 JEW.L +62 269
#note Geez, what did I ever do to you, Mike?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEIKST 1H .uAKIEST +113 224
#note LOL that was ridiculous. Plus I think it's funny that both the blanks are Us and they both went on the Q.
>Mike_Ryan: EFT 14F FE.T +30 299
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIIRSU 2J HI +32 256
#note Wow, HAR(MONISTS). Never even occured to me. There's a handful of other extensions too. RISHI is a pretty neat looking play at 2J.
>Mike_Ryan: ACETX 7F .X +34 333
>Mike_Ryan: ACETX --  -34 299
#note Mike loses focus and gives me the break I need....
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIRSUU 6H U.AU +6 262
#note Too bad I have to dump  after a pretty awful draw. (L)UAU works too and I missed AURU(M).
>Mike_Ryan: ACETX 3C EXACT. +32 331
#note I don't know his last 2 letters, but he must have missed (R)AX for 40 and C(O)AX for 42.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINPRS 4D IN +24 286
#note Absurd... there's not a single bingo here. I got pretty frustrated when I couldn't find anything and thought I was missing something super obvious. Much time was wasted here before I finally played this. Keeps the rack in decent shape, all I can do....
>Mike_Ryan: BILO D11 OB.LI +16 347
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEPRS 3J APED +29 315
#note This was a critical miss. If I had played A11 PA(R)ED using the same letters I probably would have won the game. I did notice the spot but I let it slip by me this turn. Sigh.
>Mike_Ryan: BDEO A11 BO.ED +39 386
#note And Mike doesn't make the same mistake, taking the huge points.
>Matthew_Larocque: AHOPRSU 4K SHOP +41 356
#note Stupid. Keep the S, then he's pressured to try and block it without opening anything. I don't really track during non-tourny games but regardless I'm basically resigning to a narrow loss here. Just a really poor decision.
>Mike_Ryan: EY E10 YE +19 405
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIRRUW -GIRUW +0 356
#note Again the tracking... I didn't check how many Rs were out. I think I saw WR(AN)G but I wasn't sure about it. A big Z play would help here but I think Mike needs to make a big error to lose now.
>Mike_Ryan: IU N4 .IU +7 412
>Matthew_Larocque: AAGRRTZ O6 TZAR +41 397
#note Lucky draw.
>Mike_Ryan: DEMOW N8 MOWED +25 437
>Matthew_Larocque: AGGIRUV E2 V..G +16 413
#note I kind of shake my head and just complete the game....
>Mike_Ryan: INRR M11 RIN +11 448
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIRU L12 GUAR +24 437
#note RAGI scores 25.
>Mike_Ryan: R F12 R.. +6 454
>Mike_Ryan:  (I) +2 456
#note Good game, I had a few lucky-as-hell draws - but screwed up too much after to make the comeback.
