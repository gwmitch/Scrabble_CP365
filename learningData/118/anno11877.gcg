#note Make or break! I had two options in mind, either I score with QUENAS (14a) to block the bingo lane in the 15th row, or go for QUALE 12g and hope that Sulaiman will not bingo out.
>Ronald: AAENQSU 12H QUA.E +56 354
#note Based on unseen, I thought that GRIEFERS was a possiblity, and I could lose the game if that was his rack. (Note: GOODSIRE was another one as I checked it after the game).
>Sulaiman: DEFIORS F2 FID +22 333
#note Sulaiman has DEFIORS as his final rack and no possible bingo, and so the Gulf Scrabble Championship title belongs to me!
>Ronald: AENOPRS 15H PERSONA. +83 437
#note Sulaiman was not tracking the tiles, so I went out with a last bingo!
>Ronald:  (EORS) +8 445
