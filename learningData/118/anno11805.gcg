#note i really wanted to try EWOK but there are probably limits to Collins' permissiveness. FEEL/FEE/FLEE here sim best; this is a mistake. (-7)

#note fishing for something in column O. 11M BUT/BUN are the clear winners here though, ah i love tricky quackle. those plays don't come naturally to me. (-7.5)

#note saw FAIX# but there are too many good racks that could get me. FAX 5F is the surprising winner with a 70% win. how?? apparently i get a bingo 83% of the time after it!? (-23)

#note the winning play here is goddamn TAGMA#; i lost another game on another collins 5 too. you dumb dictionary. probably shoulda just taken MAGoT for 17 instead of losing more spread, i guess.
