#note Very surprised I didn't see ABAYA 6G; maybe I didn't know it back then? That must have been the case.
>Keith_Smith: CEL 5K CEL +26 44
>Sam: AGMNTUY 4L MANY +36 89

>Keith_Smith: INOQ D4 Q.OIN +30 109
>Sam: AFHNRUY 2J YAH +41 205

>Keith_Smith: IJV O1 JIV. +51 160
>Sam: ?FNORTU 9F FUN +24 229
#note Didn't spot the common-word bingoes TURNOFf C7 or UpFRONT C8.

#note SItUATE or SInUATE L7 score a little more.
>Sam: ?ELORST L7 SETtLOR +73 302
#note STEROLs L7 is probably a little better because it doesn't surrender an S-hook. Overscored by two points.
