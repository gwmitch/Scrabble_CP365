#note Yuck. This sequence was no fun, but there just wasn't much else available.

#note I chose this over YELP to keep the Y for ZINGY, but completely missed THEY for 8 more points.

#note I guess this was an okay move with this rack, but I didn't feel great about it. Funny, the A-hook seemed like a bigger worry than giving the S to play through...

#note "I really don't know what I should've done here. Maybe EAU 10D, since I have to think I'm closer to a bingo than him, though a J-play could be just as crushing as a bingo at this point. I also thought of AIL M13 and dismissed it for some reason; thinking back, it's a lot smarter to hold the U at this point in time. ALIAS H11 might also work fairly enough because it holds the U and sort of makes bingoing more troublesome. This single move cost me the game."
