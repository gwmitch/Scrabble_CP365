>Harriette: AEIJMTT -  +0 0
#note Harriette traded in five tiles to start the game.
>Steve: EEFGINW 8G FEW +18 18
>Harriette: BNOU I4 UNBO. +11 11
#note I didn't even blink at this phoney, for two reasons: I saw a front S- hook possibility, and recognized it that way; also it wasn't worth very much. You have to know your words cold to challenge an 11-pt. play.
>Steve: DEEGINP J4 PEED +24 42
#note Second best to the 2x2. A six point error.
>Harriette: AEIMOST K7 ATOMIES +72 83
#note I pay the stupid tax for not challenging off the phony on her previous play.
>Steve: ADGIINT 12D INDIGAT. +74 116
#note Realized this wasn't good shortly after finding it, but early enough in the game to see if it will fly.
>Harriette: CELNO 13A CLONE +18 101
>Steve: DLOUUVZ H1 LOUD +29 145
#note Just slightly better than the higher scoring COZ, according to Q, but not even close in my mind.
>Harriette: ??ACENR L1 CRANErs +74 175
>Harriette: ??ACENR --  -74 101
#note Missing one available 3x3.
>Steve: AEEUUVZ B10 UVU.A +20 165
#note Knew enough not to set up a 3x3 line on row 15 after seeing her two blanks, otherwise I might throw one of the duplicate Es on the end here. Duck agrees this is best, regardless.
>Harriette: ??ACENR 1H .AuNChER +83 184
#note Several bingos along row 15 score six more points.
>Steve: EEERRYZ 15A EERY +42 207

#note 2F ZOOM.
>Harriette: DNR 10A N.RD +17 275
>Steve: EIKMORT 2J MO +21 293
#note Terrible. MIKRO(N) best followed by TOME(S). Equity error of 12+ points.
>Harriette: OX 2M OX +37 312
>Steve: AEIKRRT A4 KERATI. +48 341
>Harriette: EILOQSS -  +0 312
#note Harriette trades in four tiles.
>Steve: AAIORTT B1 IOTA +14 355
#note I liked this play at the time, especially since my opponent just traded in four tiles. I figured if she had the Q she was likely to have put it back in the mix.
>Harriette: NPY 1A P.NY +39 351
#note Oops.
>Steve: ABEHLRT M1 ..B +8 363
#note I ate up a lot of time thinking of what to do here, and put myself in time trouble. I wanted to keep the A as an insurance policy for the Q. Best is EATH at N8.
>Harriette: GS F10 G..S +18 369
>Steve: AEHILRT K4 ET +17 380
#note Now is the time to play one tile. Instead, I empty the bag. ugh.
>Harriette: EGIOSST O1 .OSETS +17 386
#note She misses a bingo, (not that I would have found it), but with me going over on time, it won't matter. 
>Steve: AHILQRV 7F QI +18 398
>Harriette: GI 6A .IG +6 392
#note I went two minutes over on time. Game score was recorded as 414-376.
>Harriette:  (AHLRV) +22 414
