>Pete: BCGGIST 8G GIG +10 10
#note Exchanging BGG sims best.  I've been trying to exchange less... maybe I just need to recognize when to exchange.
>Mike_Weepie: MNOU 9E MUON +13 13
>Pete: AABCSTT E7 TA.BAC +24 34
#note Best.  I almost passed on this, thinking I was confusing it with TOMBAC.  
>Mike_Weepie: BIJ 10B JIB. +31 44
>Pete: AEOSSTY B10 .ATOS +24 58
#note Wow, this one is just a stupid, stupid miss. I was afraid of giving back a huge score along the A column with JOEYS.  I think I do better when I stop worrying about what my opponent's may do... particularly is the early game.
>Mike_Weepie: EHP A13 HEP +31 75
>Pete: EESTXYZ J6 ZESTY +51 109
#note Decided against saving the Y for next turn, and duck agrees.  Had I not had the X, I would probably have saved it.
>Mike_Weepie: DIR C10 .RID +28 103
>Pete: EEIILMX F6 XI +27 136
#note Decided to play small here.  EEILM is not as strong a leave as I evaluated it over the board.  considered MILIA, MILIA and ELEMI K10, which I didn't know, with its nice double X setup are both better than XI.
>Mike_Weepie: ?GINNPR H2 RePINN..G +64 167
#note Very nice, only bingo. 
>Pete: EEEILMR -  +0 136
#note And now, I challenge unsuccessfully.  I wrote out the alphagram DEEINNPR on my scorecard, and in a momentary mindfart, which I can only explain by too much caffeine and too early in the morning, I don't remember it.  Free turn for Mike.
>Mike_Weepie: AADLNV K2 VANDAL +33 200
>Pete: EEEILMR I10 EEL +10 146
#note Tilt play here... trying to clean my rack and open the board, but so many plays do this better, like LEE L3.  Duck likes EME i2, but I wanted to stay open.
>Mike_Weepie: AKY 13G KAY +30 230
>Pete: DEEIMRW 8A DERM. +33 179
#note I didn't think this was a bad play when I made it, but duck hates it.  Duck likes fishing with WE L3, which on reflection makes sense.  I wanted to score, and I hoped I could catch well.
>Mike_Weepie: ?EEFLRT L7 FERTiLE +76 306
#note He missed a bunch of better bingoes to the D in the A column, but it's academic... this about does it if I don't bingo back fast.
>Pete: AEEIOTW 14D TOWIE +24 203
#note Duck gets hyperagressive, with OWE j13.  Had this happened a couple games later, when I was out of contention, so would I.  I wanted to build a rack, but not get run over on spread.  Duck lives WAE 14F is that place, and WOE L3 better as well, among others.  WOE should have been my pick.
>Mike_Weepie: ACIV 2D VICA. +16 322
>Pete: AEEOUUW 4J U.AU +8 211
#note Nothing like an EOUUW draw from a somewhat promising unseen pool to let you know you're gonna lose.  I go UNAU, duck exchanges 6.  The best non-exchange, per duck is UVEA D1
>Mike_Weepie: NOO 7A ONO +12 334
>Pete: DEEOORW 2K .OWED +24 235
#note The neat ROWED underlap at 15C, and OWE F13 win sim.  VOWED is kind of weak, but by this point, frustration had set in.
>Mike_Weepie: OU O1 U.O +12 346
>Pete: EEHINOR J13 OR +15 250
#note oh, so now I draw a bingo rack... gee, thanks bag.  HO M13 actually wins about 30% of the time, per duck.  My play is second at about 13%, no other play in double digits.
>Mike_Weepie: Q 11K Q. +20 366
>Pete: EEHINST 15J THEINE +33 283
#note best valuation.
>Mike_Weepie: AEFILRS 15C SAFER +29 395
