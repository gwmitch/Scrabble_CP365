>Doug_Brockmeier: ELMPSSU E2 SLUMPE.S +74 94
#note Ugh, this isn't good. Made enough sense to me. The real bingo here is RUMPLESS, and the real ones in the seven are LUMPERS and RUMPLES. 
>Sam: ?DEMNOR H1 DORMiEN. +89 89
>Doug_Brockmeier: AEEV 2A EAVE. +16 110
>Sam: CEGHNOV A1 V.NGE +33 122
>Doug_Brockmeier: DW 4D W.D +14 124
>Sam: CHORTTY 4H .OTHY +26 148
#note Didn't know BOTCHY D8, which is easily best.
>Doug_Brockmeier: EGLO D8 .OGLE +18 142
>Sam: CDIKLRT K3 T.ICK +28 176
>Doug_Brockmeier: AA C1 A.A +12 154
>Sam: BDFILRX 2G B.LD +11 187
#note Wow, this play sure looks horrible. FIX C12 and DIB 6A are good options.
>Doug_Brockmeier: AEI F3 I.EA +19 173
>Sam: EFILRUX 11C F.UX +28 215
#note VENGEFUL A1! Should have seen this extension opportunity as soon as I played VENGE. 
>Doug_Brockmeier: AEIPRRS L7 ASPIRER +76 249
>Sam: EILQRUW 13I QUI.ER +50 265
>Sam: EILQRUW --  -50 215
#note Remember when I got away with QUIRER* against Idalski? This is where it comes back to haunt me. 
>Doug_Brockmeier: FIZ 13K F.IZ +32 281
>Sam: EILQRUW N10 WUR.EL +52 267
>Doug_Brockmeier: AHI 15L HI.A +33 314
>Sam: ADIIOQY 13B QADI +38 305
>Sam: ADIIOQY --  -38 267
#note Now I'm down by so much that I have to try BOGLED*, which seemed alright to me (couldn't BOGLE just mean BOGGLE?). OIDIA 10F is probably best.
>Doug_Brockmeier: GNOO O8 GOON +22 336
>Sam: ADIIOQY -ADIIOQY +0 267
#note OIDIA 10F again sims best, though by very little over my exchange.
>Doug_Brockmeier: JO 10B JO. +32 368
>Sam: EIINRTT 14E NITRITE +66 333
#note Drawing a natural is the best thing that could have happened. Underscored by four points.
>Doug_Brockmeier: DEOT 15F TOED +28 396
#note Great block.
>Sam: ?AEIIQU 9I QUI. +25 358
#note With a slightly different draw, I might have actually won this insane game. gENII G6 is three points better, keeping QUA N6 and QUARE H11.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ACNOSY M5 CAY +26 422
>Sam: ?AEI 3K .AwIE +13 371
#note tINEA or tENIA G6 are both a point better.
>Sam:  (NOS) +6 377
