#note Statically this is awful, but the AAE leave isn't that bad when there are a few consonants (M, G, D) floating to bingo with. The sim is nice to me... this isn't a lot worse than AVO 1M. -3.
>Randy: ASV 1L VA.S +49 349
>Evans: ?AABEFT F4 FAT +19 222
#note Okay, so I'm not gonna find FABULATE. Whatever. But I have no excuse for missing all the fives (TAFIA L11, ABAFT D11, BEFIT L11) that I could be playing. I'm just further fucking up an already fucked up board, and I'm down 150. -21

#note I missed BLINDSIDE! Nines are crazy.
>Randy: ATY D9 ..ATY +23 411
>Evans: ?EILNOS C13 OI +14 286
#note This time I missed TOLIDINES, which is more findable since it's just the plural of a high-prob eight. Sigh. -9

>Evans: ??CELNS H3 NuCLe..ES +60 346
#note This turn was fun because Adam, Joel and Looby all gathered around me after the game to figure out which valid nines I missed by playing this phony. The five correct answers are SCREENFUL, PRECLEANS, CRENELLES, NUCLEOIDS and LUCIDNESS. Interestingly though, Quackle wants to pass up all five. CREEL G7 keeps NS??, leaves two in the bag, and according to CP has a 17 percent chance at stealing the win. I have no freaking clue why.
>Randy: AEMNNOT F11 AMENT +13 446
#note Best sequence is extending FAT to NONFAT and then going out next turn with REMATE G8. Also REMANENT G8 isn't that good a play, but it's kinda cool.
>Evans: AILNR G13 RAI +11 357
#note I didn't see AGAR... RIN or RAN at G11 is best. -7
