>Jason: DEMNQRX 8G REX +20 20
#note I don't know why I didn't exchange. I don't know why I didn't play DEX instead. I don't know why I'm 1800. I just don't know. (-16.8)
>Keith_Cejmer: ?AEHNSW 7H WASHmEN +79 79
#note I know Keith phonies a lot ... so I don't even hold. I suck. But so does he for missing a 101-point ENSWAtH(E), not just playing WAHiNES in this spot. So say I.
>Jason: DIIMNQS J5 QI. +14 34
#note MI at 6I is slightly better. I stupidly went "must get rid of Q ... must get rid of Q ..." (-1.1)
>Keith_Cejmer: IINTW K4 WIT.IN +48 127
#note Well, this is looking like a round 3 replay.
>Jason: DEIIMNS L1 MINES +42 76
#note Q likes the fish of MI(REX), which I didn't see. I just wanted to grab points before this game got out of hand. (-4.7)
>Keith_Cejmer: BDLN 2J BL.ND +28 155
#note And I allow Keith to clean up a consonant-heavy rack. Go me.
>Jason: CDDDEFI 8M FED +28 104
#note Just trying to grab points and hope the rack cleans itself up. Duck approves.
>Keith_Cejmer: AOV 1H OVA +22 177
>Jason: CDDIKNP F8 PICK +31 135
#note OK, we're scoring decently. At least we've seemed to weather the opening barrage.
>Keith_Cejmer: EF 9M FE +25 202
>Jason: ADDEMNO M2 .OD +19 154
#note Note that the D on my opening rack is still here. And if I'd played DEX and the rest of the game unfolds as it has, I have MADRONE here. But since I don't, I make a fish I wasn't happy about. But Duck says it's the clear play.
>Keith_Cejmer: Z I6 Z.. +31 233
>Jason: AABDEMN 1N AB +15 169
#note Didn't know BEADMAN. At least I picked the best non-bingo, which is kind of like the Blazers saying they picked the best non-Michael Jordan in that infamous draft. (-54.1)
>Keith_Cejmer: GOR 11C GRO. +18 251
>Jason: ADEEMNS D5 MEANDE.S +74 243
#note Did not know DEMEANS' anagram (should, but don't), which plays for 11 more. (-13.0)
>Keith_Cejmer: ?AEILRT O8 .ETAILeR +83 334
#note Now I know how many of my opponents this year have felt. (Scored as 80.)
>Jason: ACLPRRU 8A CUR. +18 261
#note Well, this sucks. I'm sitting going "Double-blanked again, gonna be 1-3, this sucks, this really sucks," esp. since the only power tiles left are JS. But, this is the board to come back on. And when I saw this, I relaxed a little. Another good bingo line, ALPR isn't a bad leave with E's to draw, maybe Keith gives me a free turn with a phony. No need to call in my obituary yet. Q likes URP at C5, which mystifies me. (-9.6?)
>Keith_Cejmer: AORVY E1 OVARY +36 370
#note Not seeing a bingo in my rack, I figure my comeback hopes are almost dead.
>Jason: AEEILPR 15H PEARLIE. +83 344
#note Until I pull this out of my nether regions. $20 for the best PURPLE word, second year in a row I've won it (SPOILER last year). Alex could've beaten me out with PROPANE for more points, but Paul Epstein blocked the best spot. I offered him the envelope the $20 came in ... oddly, that didn't make him feel better.
>Keith_Cejmer: OOOUUU -OOOUUU +0 370
#note Ooh, baby! Pass six combined with my great draw, and suddenly I've gone from near dead to favored. (Keith was upset after this game, but later, after winning his last three after this, we talked about the game a little. This was his exact exchange, which I guessed from looking at my tracking.)
>Jason: EIJNSTT 1D J.T +18 362
#note Looking at OOOOUUU unseen, I like COUNTIES or COONTIES. Still plenty of other bingo lines if I don't hit that, plus, now I can just outrun him, maybe.
>Keith_Cejmer: ALOT 2C LO.AT +23 393
>Jason: EINOSTU A8 .OUNTIES +83 445
#note I will the OU out of the bag and we're home free. Keith was upset at himself for not blocking, but how? Remember, at this point we're close. He can't block the C and score and I can probably outrun him with O(V)INE where he played LOVAT if he does.
>Keith_Cejmer: AEGGHIY J9 AGGIE +13 406
#note OMG, Keith has a win! See it?
>Jason: OOTUU 11J .OUT +10 455
#note Missed his good out. (G)OO is clearly best, threatening a (T)UTU out for me. (-15.0)
>Keith_Cejmer: HY 12D .HY +30 436
#note It's just not my nature to fold up the tent because I'm down 100. Usually it just leads to heartache, but when it pays off like in this game ... ooh, how sweet. It took four games, but now I got my sea legs under me and the confidence flowing.
>Keith_Cejmer:  (OU) +4 440
