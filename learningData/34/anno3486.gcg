>Sam: ?ADEILM 8D MIsDEAL +74 74
#note DEcLAIM 8F looks best, despite giving back the -ERS and -ING extensions to the triple. 
>Jon_Shreve: CINY D8 .INCY +24 24
>Sam: DEHQRTZ 7I HERTZ +42 116
#note ZED 7I sims best here. I guess the Q isn't so bad when an I draw leads to QI C9 44, but I still don't fully get why ZED is best. Maybe it just makes more sense defensively? It also keeps the T and H for QAT or QOPH and opens the D for QAID. I even wrote the two options of ZED and HERTZ on my scoresheet.
>Jon_Shreve: ACEEERT L6 E.CETERA +76 100
#note Great find!
>Sam: DEILQRW C9 QI +44 160
>Jon_Shreve: JNU B10 JUN +52 152
>Sam: DEGLRUW K9 WUD +27 187
#note WTF, did I not see DJIN?!? WUD A8 is obviously and easily best.
>Jon_Shreve: AFOY A12 OFAY +36 188
>Sam: DEGLNRR 13J GN.RL +12 199
#note Better than the handful of DJIN plays.
>Jon_Shreve: IST O13 SIT +16 204

>Sam: AEOPSTX 10F PAX +39 360
#note Didn't spot EXPIATES H8, which is 1.5 points better or so.
>Jon_Shreve: IOSV N10 VIO.S +36 283

>Jon_Shreve: BOW M3 BOW +26 309
>Sam: EENOOST 7E OE +5 394
#note Q prefers TOES 14I, which seems like it opens up row 15 with IIOO still unseen. OE B7 gives up big K plays at 6F. I sort of like my play, blocking the most fruitful lanes, but it's not necessarily best or anything. TOE 7E actually looks like a big improvement.
>Jon_Shreve: GI J13 .IG +7 316
>Sam: EKNOSTV 15H VE. +21 415
#note The sim likes TOKENS H1, but this looks obviously right to me. 
>Jon_Shreve: ENOOPRT F6 R.. +4 320
>Sam: ?KNOOST 5E KOTO +19 434
#note The sim strongly prefers KNOT 5D for some reason. Jon will surely take advantage of that S-hook, I'd think.
>Jon_Shreve: EHNOPST F4 P.... +6 326
>Sam: ?AGHNOS 3B vANGS +17 451
#note No idea why I played this. I guess I was scared he had a seven I wasn't seeing? Anyway, iSOGON H1 is best, followed by HANGOvER 1H.
>Jon_Shreve: EILMNST 1H MISENT.. +33 359
>Sam: HO J10 HO +31 482
#note Maybe I just wanted to leave myself this, but that's certainly not a good endgame sequence anyway. 
>Sam:  (L) +2 484
