#note fresh off my last drubbing, I see this rack.  I'm messed up more opening play or exchanges situations this weekend than I can recall.  I didn't like what PIX left me, or how it left the board. This exchange is awful... shoulda ditched the X.  Exh. TVX wins sim.
>Carolyn_Easter: ?AEFLOT 8D FLOATEd +76 76
#note And now, I get hammered with by an opening bingo.  I'm about ready to blow up.  
>Pete: EINNSTX 9G NIX +41 41
#note Keeping the X ends up working, tho.  Brainless and best.
>Carolyn_Easter: ARW 7I RAW +19 95
>Pete: EENRSTV L1 VENTERS +85 126
#note Woo hoo!  REVENANTS is cool, but scores far less, and since I didn't see it anyways, I'll take my bingo.  I'm in a game!
>Carolyn_Easter: ABFOSUU E4 FABU.OUS +102 197
#note Oof.  Beautiful find.  Originally scored as 92.  I recounted while Carolyn was retracking late game, and found the error, informing her immediately.  It definitely could have impacted the game.  
>Pete: ?AAGHQT G7 Q..AT +24 150
#note I sacrifice the points for an open board more balanced leave with the blank.  GARTH 6J woulda been sweet. Party on.
>Carolyn_Easter: AHIJ D1 HAJI +46 243
>Pete: ?ABEGHL 2C H.nGABLE +69 219
#note I miss GALABIEH.  HANGABLE works ok.  
>Carolyn_Easter: IO H1 O.I +15 258
>Pete: GIMNORS K5 MO. +26 245
#note I don't see the cool MOVING up top, but I liked the fish.  
>Carolyn_Easter: IIIII -IIIII +0 258
>Pete: GIMNRSS 5D S.NG +20 265
#note MOR and MORS wins.  I wanted to dump the G, in a position and rach when I should have held it.
>Carolyn_Easter: AELU 1K U.EAL +24 282
>Pete: DIMNRSU D10 MUD +18 283
#note MUSH, which kills the RAJ/TAJ possibility, is interesting, but MURID, which I didn't know, is best.  MUD is second.
>Carolyn_Easter: AIO 1C O.IA +16 298
>Pete: IKNORSY 3K I.KY +22 305
#note I miss IKONS, but my play sims best.  I didn't want to open at this point, and kept things tight.
>Carolyn_Easter: ILOOV H11 OVOLI +38 336
#note If it seems like I'm getting outplayed, well... yeah, I got outplayed for a lot of this game.
>Pete: DNORRST 6J D..R +16 321
#note clearly best.  wins sim by 8% points, keeps the S with a leave with some bingo potential, on a now volatile board.
>Carolyn_Easter: EPY G13 YEP +27 363
>Pete: ENOPRST 14A PETRON..S +76 397
#note I catch, but Carolyn blocks the eights.  Fortunately, the 9 smacks me in the face.  She holds for quite a while, but wisely accepts.
>Carolyn_Easter: CEE A12 CE.E +33 396
>Pete: ACDENWZ N1 .N. +12 409
#note I mistrack here, and play way too short. I miss the killer setup of NEWT C11.  the only block she would have only workes if I don't draw a T.  My play is idiotic, thinking there was one more N in the bag than there was, and wanting to avoid a big play there by here in a nip and tuck game.
>Carolyn_Easter: DEN C9 DEN +14 410
>Pete: ACDIIWZ B8 ZA +14 423
#note WAIF 4B, threatening WIZ, is best.  ZA starts a race.  while her tiles are better.
>Carolyn_Easter: EEGIRRT 12A .RE. +12 422
#note She also has me mistracked, making her unwilling to play big.  TI/OBIT, blocking my best C play, is best and any long word from the V or TO wins.
>Pete: CDIITW 4H TIC +13 436
#note ED/DINKY sims best.  TIC sets up a two play out sequence for 15 that can be blocked, but gives her a better spot for the G to lure her away from it.  Messed up end game with very little time to figure it out.
>Carolyn_Easter: EGIRT 3G G.E +16 438
#note Blocking the O, or VIG wins.  Taking the points loses.
>Pete: DIW E13 D.W +7 443
#note DOW sews up the game.
>Carolyn_Easter: IRT A9 TI +6 444
>Pete: I M3 .I +8 451
