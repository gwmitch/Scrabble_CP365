>glenda: BDEIT 8D DEBIT +20 20
>moh: DEFLOOP 9G FOP +26 26
#note Easy breezy. FOP scores well and leaves DEOL, a promising start. I like when they're this obvious.
>glenda: AEHS D8 .EASH +18 38
>moh: ADELNOW E10 WOAD +30 56
#note E10 WOALD 32 would normally be a reasonble play here, but Glenda just used an S for DEASH, implying she might have another waiting in the wings. Given that likelihood, I refuse to make row that wide open for her with WOALD. 
>glenda: ADIMRTU -ADI +0 38
>moh: EELNNNQ -ELNNQ +0 56
#note So much for my promising leave! This is a clear exchange. It's pretty close among keeping [ELN], keeping [N], and keeping [EN]. I wouldn't consider any other exchange here, including throwing them all back. There's a certain stability that's guaranteed by keeping at least EN, and that's what I settled on.
>glenda: AEIOSTZ J4 AZOTISE +79 117
#note Nice play...even nicer is 10L AZOTISE for 92!
>moh: EEHNRTX F12 HEX +41 97
#note As flashy as 4I N(A)RTHEX 50 is, HEX is the play.
>glenda: BIOOR 5G BOR.OI +34 151
#note Consecutive cool zed words!
>moh: ?EGINRT 11H REsTING +80 177
#note REsTING was better at M3. Unfortunately, I had settled on my play before she made hers. That's generally a bad idea.
>glenda: EIJNPRU 6B JUNIPER +94 245
#note It turns out the doyenne of Okie Scrabble can play! Stellar three-turn sequence!
>moh: DEEIORT M7 ORIE.TED +72 249
#note The only bingo.
>glenda: CINU H11 .UNIC +24 269
>moh: AANNNOS N1 ANONNAS +70 319
>moh: AANNNOS --  -70 249
#note Big blunder. I misspelled the word. It's ANNONAS. She challenged ANONNAS* right off!
>glenda: AAK 8L A.AK +27 296
>moh: AANNNOS M2 NANS +26 275
#note All of the top plays hook BORZOI here. I didn't want to open row 1 with NONAS, NANAS, NAANS, etc., but I had to get rid of two Ns and an A. Pretty obvious when it's put in those terms: M2 NANS 26. 
>glenda: DUW N1 WUD +21 317
>moh: ?AEELNO O1 ENOL +37 312
#note Timing, sweet timing. With no bingos available, Glenda gives me the perfect fit to get right back into this game.
>glenda: FGO 4F FOG +20 337
>moh: ?AAEELV N13 LEV +20 332
#note This position is tough. On the one hand, I'd really like to open up a bingo lane or two since I have the blank and a decent supporting cast for a bingo. However, I was really worried about plays starting from 14J: QUI(D)S, QUA(D)S, QAI(D)S all put the game firmly in Glenda's hands. But it's not just the biggies there that worry me, as there are other medium plays that would be hard to recover from, and it's the only spot on this board that Glenda has any real chance to score with. That said, EVA(D)E would have been a fine play. I obsessed about her responding with a huge play from O12 that hooked EVADER or EVADES. My N13 LEV made sure she could not respond with a high-scoring play, but it cost me too much in terms of leave (two As at this point! Seriously?). N11 (G)ALE 20 wins the sim, with N11 (G)ALEA 22 just behind. Another cool option: B6 (J)AVA 14 for the bingo lane setup.
>glenda: MMU 5C MUM +28 365
>moh: ?AAEEGL 4C AG +19 351
#note With a consonant-heavy unseen pool, I wasn't that worried about keeping ?AEEL, and AG scores enough to keep me right in it. At this point, if Glenda gets saddled with the Q or even a tough V rack, I can probably pull it out even without a bingo. 3C GALE 15 wins the sim, but I didn't want to draw that many tiles. As I said, the more I can avoid the remaining CQVYY, the more likely I win this game.
>glenda: ILRSTVY B2 TRY +19 384
>moh: ?AEEILR 2A A.ELIERs +59 410
#note Had I been able to set up a second good bingo alley with a single-tile play (preferably an E), I would have seriously considered it. It would have cut my Q- and V-stick chances in half. A bingo here is not enough to outrun her if I do draw a toxic tile as I empty the bag. But no setup is available, so I have to take the bingo and cross my fingers. (The other bingo was (T)REEaAIL, but it gives up a huge place for QAT.)
>glenda: CILQSTV E1 Q. +11 395
#note So Glenda got all the clunky stuff that I was trying to avoid. I really was lucky here, as many final draws stuck me with unplayable tiles. Any Q draw is easy for Glenda to force the stick by mucking up E1, but so are a bunch of other draws that include the V, or maybe even the C (although the C(AW) and C(RESTING) options for a C would make it tough unless my other tile was also sticky).
