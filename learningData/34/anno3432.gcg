#note Another terrible pre-endgame play. Only bingo I saw given the pool was NIGHEST at K1. So, I tried to score, and leave (H)IRED for points if he had it. Missed the cool AM(I)R at 13L. (-7.9)
>Alex_Fiszbein: DEGHNST 12I S... +16 359
#note Alex's correct rack. Cute play, although at the time it caused an eyebrow arch. But I then saw what he was up to.
