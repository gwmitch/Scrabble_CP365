>Jeff_Clark: ACGIRST H7 CIG +12 12
#note Jeff was good enough to provide his racks.  He saw TRAGICS, but wasn't sure on it (GASTRIC is there too).  CIG creates a board that likely requires an S or bingo to be really playable... he's got an S, and if I don't, it's liable to get ugly.
>Pete: AJLNNUW -JLNUW +0 0
#note my exchange doesn't show on the static choices, but finishes neck and neck with exchange 4 at the top of sim.   Any play I could make opens more dangerous lines, leaves drek, and doesn't score.  Exchanging was the only option that made sense.
>Jeff_Clark: ARRSTVY 10F VASTY +34 46
#note Best.
>Pete: AEENOOP 11J OE +9 9
#note well, that sucked.  Another great draw for me.  POOVE is the best of a bad lot, with my play second, about equivalent to AEON in either placement.  
>Jeff_Clark: HLORRUX 7E LUR.H +15 61
#note Duck plays the anagram, which makes the potential X play a little easier, as OX plays over CHURL and not LURCH.  Right idea, tho.
>Pete: AEINOPQ F4 PIQ.E +36 45
#note I guess the Q bailed me out here, allowing, nay, forcing me to take his X spot.  Of course, I didn't recognize the play as an X setup, so I left a new spot.  OPAQUE and QUA are best.
>Jeff_Clark: ADKNORX 12J DRANK +29 90
#note Duck takes the X spot now, but I like playing DRANK over one square, which sets up a second X spot, and opens the board while I'm scuffling.  If I play to the triple, he's scoring a mininum of 40 next turn.
>Pete: ALMNOPU 13L MOAN +26 71
#note I still haven't caught on to his X... MOAN is a bit of a frustration play. I didn't want to leave a big play through the K with the TLS DWS combo.  I really misevaluated the threats here. LOUP E2 is best.
>Jeff_Clark: BDOSTUX E3 BOX +46 136
#note Duck finds the supersweet DOUBT 14J, which saves the X spot, and opens a potential new one on the bottom row.  It's followed by DOUX and BOX.  BOX keeps the board tight, which works to Jeff advantage here.
>Pete: DLNNPRU 4C PL.. +16 87
#note Duck exchanges to PR or plays UNBOX.  My play, which finishes well on the static evaluator, gets hamered by sim.  I'm feeling like I'm getting run over... the board is not friendly to a comeback, and the bag has been rather ugh so far.
>Jeff_Clark: DGISTTU 14J GUIDS +45 181
#note best.  
>Pete: DEINNRU 8B NUDI. +10 97
#note I finally draw a seven, but the odds of getting a seven down seem slim for the foreseeable future.  Of course, the eight thru the P doesn't fit. Feeling the game slipping away, I try to open the board and take my chances drawing at ENR.  Duck fishes the N with AMIN. NUDIE finishes far behind... I was too desperate, too early.
>Jeff_Clark: AAEHTTY 9A YAH +24 205
#note DEATHY is best, but YAH nicely ties things up.
>Pete: EENORRS 15L RE +15 112
#note best, followed by EROSE on row 15.  
>Jeff_Clark: AEINOTT 15I TO +5 210
#note NATATION is fun, INTO and TOPI wins sim.  TO makes this board ugly and leaves one weak line with a 98 point lead.  The longer plays to the triple there sim better, but seeing that I just made a fish, I wouldn't play them.
>Pete: DELNORS A9 .ONDERS +39 151
>Pete: DELNORS --  -39 112
#note I miss YODLERS, and out of sheer desperation, frustration, and three games worth of pissed-off ness, try the intentional phony.  Other than YODLERS, ONTO is best.
>Jeff_Clark: AAEFINT 10A AN +14 224
#note AFT 6I is best, replacing the best remaining line with a tougher one to use.
>Pete: DELNORS C2 LO. +10 122
#note I feel obliged to open here.  Duck likes LO 3B for the 2 extra points.  
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEFIMT 1A MIfF +41 265
#note Jeff chooses this over FEM keeping the blank.  duck keeps the blank.  I would too, with one line still open, that if bingoed on, opens the triple line.  But MIFF pressures me to bingo twice, and assume he may have the second blank already.
>Pete: DEENRSW A9 ..WNERS +42 164
#note best.
>Jeff_Clark: AAESTTW B12 ATE +14 279
#note ATE wins sim, killing all the new lines I've opened.
>Pete: DEEEJOZ 7E .....ED +13 177
#note I blow up the last remaining line for sevens.  OXID, setting up a potential Huge Z play with a lucky draw, is the only reasonable play.  Another funky draw threw me off here.  
>Jeff_Clark: ?AOSTTW 6J WATT +31 310
#note TOWPATHS plays, abut wins less often than passing.  WATT wins 99.98%.  SWOT 6I wins sim.
>Pete: AEEFJOZ 15G JA.. +33 210
#note I miss ZOEAE with the newly created spot, and the FEAZE spot as well. and JEFE... I think I had just reached the breaking point, and got officially fed up.  I hate when that happens, and I have to find a way to avoid it.
>Jeff_Clark: ?CEGORS N3 CORSaGE +71 381
#note CORTEGES is one more point.
>Pete: EEEFOOZ 5J OF +30 240
#note FE M9 wins sim, setting up a BOZO play if I catch the B.
>Jeff_Clark: AEILNTV 8L VA.I +36 417
#note VIGA doesn't leave a Z play, but with the Z unseen, that's risky for spread.
>Pete: EEEIIOZ F10 .IE +6 246
#note I was fishing for the R for TZAR. VEE L7 does the same, and adds a point if I catch it, while making it less easily blocked..
>Jeff_Clark: BEILNTU L3 BUT. +18 435
#note Jeff blocks AZOIC.  LEUTIC is best.
>Pete: EEEIORZ M6 .Z.R +47 293
#note best.
>Jeff_Clark: EILN 3L .I.E +16 451
#note best.
>Pete: EEEIO 11N OE +10 303
#note best.
>Jeff_Clark: LN 11E N.L +8 459
#note best.  and that's three losses in a row for me, and I'm ready to throw a board at someone or something.
>Jeff_Clark:  (EEI) +6 465
