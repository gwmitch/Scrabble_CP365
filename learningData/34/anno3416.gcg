#note No, Quackle. I am trading here. I am trading whether you like it or not. I am down 50 points, soon to be more, and I need to bingo. Scoring 16 points with some dinky little play like DUNT L12 is not going to help me bingo soon. DLNP makes me want to puke. -9?

#note Bizarre turn. Dackman is really trying to block my bingos here, I guess -- first he puts down PEWIT and stares at it for a minute, then he picks it up and puts down URETER 14B to stare at that for a minute. So I know how whole rack, and both of those plays look fairly awful. Why not score some points with a play through OGEE, like UTERI or WEIR?

#note Statically this is -17, but it skyrockets in the sim. It's behind two different placements of TSK, 15F and 15A, which us understandable because those score a ton, but my play is good because it opens a bingo lane and gives me a chance to win.
