#note Duck likes WILE in the same spot. I was a little leery of sticking an E out in the middle of row 15, but it's the right thing to do and keeps the rack balanced.

#note This play doesn't show up in C-player's list of choices. It plays GUEST in the same spot, but also likes REWET at 5H.

#note Second best to L3 WOOS, this wins three out of four games according to Q. The valuation numbers are all over the map in this position, and I don't know how to interperet that. e.g. The valuation for WOOS is 40.3 and for TOO it's 0.2. What I really liked about this play, however, was the threat of a monster play to the tws with my W.
>Brian: EENRT 8K ENTER +28 320
#note Brian takes out the spot, but at least he has to use up bingo prone tiles to do so.
>Steve: AEGLORW 2J .OWEL +22 340
#note I felt this was the play that cost me the game; altho it's listed as winning 73 percent of the time it's just too many letters to take from the bag with the Q being a huge factor. C-player likes SOW at F4. I regretted not playing AXLE after the game.
