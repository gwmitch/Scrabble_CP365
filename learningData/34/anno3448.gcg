>Steve: EHMOORS 8D HOMER +28 28
#note Highest scoring play, but far from the best. Top three in order are OH, MHO, and HOMO, showing the power of leave, especially early in the game.
>Pete: LNOTUWY 8A OUT..... +39 39
#note Played before I could blink.
>Steve: ACGIOOS 7D AGO +16 44
#note Missed bingo, bit of a tough find. And you need some 'onions' if you're going to play it.
>Pete: ALNRTWY 6C TRAY +41 80
>Steve: CEILORS I2 RECOILS +75 119
>Pete: EEIJLNW H1 JEW +46 126
>Steve: AEEINOU -AEIOU +0 119
#note G3 EAU is best, which I saw and rejected. Interestingly, IN is preferred leave in Duck exchanges, and AN, and N, before the EN leave.
>Pete: AEIILNN J5 IN +10 136
>Steve: EEMNSVZ C3 VEN. +14 133
#note Major blunder. MEZES B2 scores 46. Next best is the cute V(ER)SEMEN for 30 while keeping the Zed.
>Pete: AEHILNN 2B HENNA +28 164
>Steve: CEIMSWZ 4B M.ZE +30 163
#note 4A ZEES is best. Grab the points. Next is 5H Z(OI)C, and then 4I (C)WMS.
>Pete: DIIILLT -  +0 164
#note Pete passed five tiles here.

#note 12B BEWIGS.

#note f1 bags or gaps. 
>Pete: ADIKLOT 14B ...OK +23 237
>Steve: EGNPRSS G11 PEGS +21 251
#note F1 GAPS. Only a 17-point equity error.
>Pete: ADILOTU F10 DUO +14 251
>Steve: ?BENPRS F1 B.PS +24 275
#note Better late than never when it comes to taking advantage of this consonant dump.
>Pete: AAIILTY K2 TAIL +14 265
>Steve: ??ENRVX G8 .X +17 292
#note plays for an extra point at 9A.
>Pete: ADGIIUY H7 A.ID +16 281
>Steve: ??ELNRV 10H .EV +15 307
#note Missed bingo, not terribly hard to find, but it's the only one. I hated this play when I made it, and still made it anyway. Mainly because it opens the board for the opponent, who is going to have a hard time scoring otherwise, but aslo since it ditches the valuable E. If I just trade the V I'm very likely to bingo next turn.
