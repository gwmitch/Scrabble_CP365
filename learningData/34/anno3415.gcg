#note He held. It's good.
>Brad: CEORSST 7B SECTORS +63 63
#note SCOOTERS is 5 points more.
>Evans: AEEKLRT J6 KE. +20 87
#note RETACKLE. Damn. -52
>Brad: JO 6F JO +52 115
>Evans: AELOQRT 9F QAT +16 103
#note I seriously considered trading one here (or maybe two, QO). I also thought about QAT M6, keeping ELORT, but I didn't want to block bingo lanes when I was losing and my rack was bingo-able. Come to think of it though, taking out that SIT hook blocks a lane itself, so it has the same problem. I should have just played QAT M6 and kept the nice leave. Trading Q, then trading QO, sims second- and third-best, followed by my play. -3
>Brad: AHX N7 H.AX +30 145
>Evans: ?ELORRW C2 ROWLE.Rs +70 173
#note Bingos that are less phony than this -- REFLOWER, FLOWERER, TROWELER. Adam pointed out all three in a matter of seconds.
>Brad: ?EILNRT K4 ELaT.RIN +85 230
#note SILENTER scores one extra point because it puts a natural I instead of a blank next to the K. But whatever.
>Evans: AEHOUYZ L3 AHOY +41 214
#note Missing YUTZ M6. I did look at that ZA spot, but I looked down from the T, not up. I considered playing HOY instead of AHOY to hold onto the A and fish for TZAR, but then I realized there was only one unseen R. (Brad, if you happened to notice me glancing down at my scorebook and visibly scowling, you now know why.) Anyway, YUTZ is a bad miss. -12
>Brad: DEIIM 10D IMIDE +30 260
>Evans: ABEITUZ 4C .IZ +30 244
#note FUCK. I missed BRAIZE 2B for about a million (read: actually only 74) points. Also, I think I was wrong to pass up BEAUT J10, which I did see. Scores being roughly equal, I'd rather keep the IZ than the ABETU. -40
>Brad: EOO E2 OO.E +26 286
>Evans: AABDETU 1E BEAUT +37 281
#note ABATED and BATEAU in the same spot score more. -4
>Brad: IVY 2I IVY +19 305
#note No M1 spot? Quite defensive.
>Evans: ADDGINU 2E .DD +19 300
#note Hahaha, DUDING is good. I missed that at L10 and AUDING at M10. My play isn't awful, but it's not one of the best options either. -4
>Brad: EFIL 11B LIFE +27 332
>Evans: ADGGINU 1K AGING +32 332
#note Wow, I did not look through the R in INFECTOR at all. GUARDING is the bingo; ARGUING is also better than my play. -65
>Brad: IPU J10 PIU +23 355
>Evans: AABDEUV B10 B.ADE +28 360
#note I continue to miss that R -- EARBUD is best. Also, the sim really hates my play, because it scores 28 but keeps a mediocre leave and gives him tons of counterplay. BLUED in the same spot would be better, as would UVEA O10. -19 (that's a little harsh, but my play was pretty bad)
>Brad: AGNP A12 PANG +42 397
#note What else did I expect?
>Evans: AMNRSUV O10 UNARMS +36 396
#note I can't think of anything better here...
>Brad: EELNOST 12D STOLE +29 426
#note Missing TONELESS/NOTELESS.
>Evans: AUVW 14M VU. +16 412
#note No excuse for missing VAW B1. None at all. I lose anyway, but still... ugh.
