>Pete: EHILORT 8D HERIOT +26 26
#note Mike and I started 3-0.  Now, We're playing again after getting beat up for the better part of the last 9 games. I was tempted to try an "accidental" phoney like HOTLE* or HOLET* and maybe set up an 8.  I decide instead to play big.  EOLITH is the better play, however.
>Mike_Weepie: ?AGILMR E7 G.RMInAL +70 70
#note Who the heck did I piss off to have this happen?
>Pete: CFILORU 9G FROLIC +30 56
#note Now totally thrown off and a bit panicked, I decide to play big again.  Duck likes the fish with FUG almost as well...
>Mike_Weepie: ?EINORT K4 pOINT.ER +78 148
#note In my last three tuens of scrabble, my opponents have played four blanks on me.  Is it Monday yet?  
>Pete: AENNOSU 14A ANNU.OSE +70 126
#note After a minute of mental bitching about the ugliness of the rack, and another minute of bitching about the lack of an R that would fit for UNREASON, I finally decide to look through the L.  ANNULOSE... cool. Mike holds, but doesn't challenge. darn.
>Mike_Weepie: DIV H12 VI.D +36 184
>Pete: AABDORT 15A BOAT +40 166
#note I see a couple cool eights, but the eight letter is not there to play through... TAGBOARD woulda been sweet.  BOAT is easily best.
>Mike_Weepie: JU 7C JU. +24 208
>Pete: ADDEKRU J6 KA +34 200
#note The lack of an open N saves me from wondering is UNDARKED* is good, and if I should risk it.  KA and DUKED are at the top of sim, and I was getting paranoid about an X or Q bomb at J6.  
>Mike_Weepie: EIILRW L1 WILIER +37 245
>Pete: ABDDERU 2J BR.DE +28 228
#note I am a chicken.  I saw BEDWARD, but figured there was no was it was good.  I took the highest scoring reasonable play I could find.  
>Mike_Weepie: INY 1L .INY +35 280
>Pete: AADEPSU 12D U.PA.ED +24 252
#note I was very proud of this play.  I'm getting beat, I'm 1-4 on the day, the bag is doing me few favors, and I am still fighting to make good plays.  best.
>Mike_Weepie: ACMO 1G COMA +28 308
>Pete: AENQSWY 3G WANY +23 275
#note My reward for a nice play is this rack, Q and all.  I didn't know SAWNEY M9, and didn't consider NEWSY M6 (must learn 5s).  WANY os well behind those, and a few others.
>Mike_Weepie: EET 4F TEE +12 320
>Pete: EGQSTVX 13G S.X +40 315
#note I almost had a moment here.  GTVX draws at this point of the tournament are infuriating.  I choose right with SIX over QATS. 
>Mike_Weepie: AFGOPSZ 5E ZA +24 344
>Pete: AEEGQTV 6F VEG +29 344
#note VEG was the only option I really considered, and it wins sim.  I saw VERGE, but I wanted to Save an E, and with two Ss remaining, VERGE was asking to be hooked with a seven ending in S.
>Mike_Weepie: DEI 11I DI.E +19 363
>Pete: AELPQST 4K ..P +4 348
#note Fishing for the U.  CLEPE which I didn't know, and PES give the best winning chances.  This play was a mistake.
>Mike_Weepie: F L11 .F +10 373
>Pete: AEGLQST M12 EL +9 357
#note I liked this play.  almost assured that, if he doesn't bingo, I can get the Q off, and if he fell asleep, I could win.   Duck finds a bit better, but I don't see the wins with it, unless I draw the U.
>Mike_Weepie: ENOOSTU N13 ONE +8 381
#note Other than the outbingo, this is best, per duck.
>Pete: AGHQST O11 QAT +16 373
#note I'm better off eating the Q, and playing GASH M7.
>Mike_Weepie: OSTU M7 OUST +19 400
>Mike_Weepie:  (GHS) +14 414
