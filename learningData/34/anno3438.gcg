#note Or THEELOL, which I didn't know.
>Jason: ?EEFIOV H1 FE +20 50
#note Q says to ditch an extra vowel. FOE at H3. (-3.8)

>Dan_Pratt: AEEINPR I6 PERINEA +70 199
#note *sigh*
>Jason: ADIMNNX H12 MINX +55 201
#note OK, up two after the fifth, I got an ADN leave, he's got a totally random rack. It's still there for me to win.
>Dan_Pratt: AELLTW J2 WALLET +27 226
>Jason: AADNNTT J10 ANT +16 217
#note Bunch of close plays. Q likes NATANT at K6, which I didn't know. (-2.2)

#note Nice that this stayed open, but now I have to brace for the -S bomb...
>Dan_Pratt: AAJR 13K AJAR +37 284
#note ...that doesn't come.
>Jason: ABDELRZ 15L BARD +48 330
#note Q likes BALD, but with RRR out, I'll sacrifice a point or so of equity to ensure future balanced-ness. (-1.2)
>Dan_Pratt: ORRY 2J .ORRY +22 306
>Jason: EELQSUZ 12A ZE.S +46 376
#note I'm looking good now. Assuming he plays from the Z, I got QI for 34 with an I or (T)OQUE or (T)UQUE by drawing an O or U. Should he bingo, he's emptying the bag and I should be able to run. (L)EZ is slightly better in win %, but I still like this play. "For God's sake, Jason, don't blow this endgame," I thought.

#note Boom goes the dynamite. Only guaranteed win ... and I'm home. (-16.8, to POL at B6)
