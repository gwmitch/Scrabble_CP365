>Harriette_Lakernick: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>Jason: AEEINOP 8D PAEON +20 20
#note So much for her playing a D. Q is not liking this play. PIANO and its EE leave is preferred, which surprises me. (-2.5)
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINPRRS E5 SPR.INER +90 90
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINPRRS --  -90 0
>Jason: EEEIIOT -EEIIO +0 20
#note I didn't even see her real bingos, but I don't think it makes a difference here. Inputting Harriette's rack, keeping EIT is a little better, says Duck. (-1.5)
>Harriette_Lakernick: EINPRRS G4 PRIS.NER +62 62
#note The three bingos through the E score a little more.
>Jason: ACEERTW F10 WAE +29 49
#note Needlessly worried about E11 plays and a potentially ugly board after WE. Looking at it now, it's clearly the only play. Le sigh. (-8.3)
>Harriette_Lakernick: EQSTU 13C QUEST +37 99
>Jason: ?CEOORT E3 COROn.TE +74 123
#note Or COROT(A)tE, which I didn't know. (-0.1)
>Harriette_Lakernick: DT 11E D..T +32 131
>Jason: AFGHILN D4 HAG +29 152
#note Another minor mistake. Duck likes FILA, H1. (-3.2)
>Harriette_Lakernick: BEIZ H1 BIZE +53 184
>Jason: DFFGILN 14B FIND +32 184
#note I just didn't like what D(U)FF gave back. Q tells me to quit being a weenie. (-12.0?)
>Harriette_Lakernick: AGN I2 NAG +25 209
>Jason: AFGJLOR C3 JOG +32 216
#note For the first time in the tourney, I make the Q-approved play.
>Harriette_Lakernick: EIMOX 12H OXIME +33 242
>Jason: AAFLMRV 13J FARM +29 245
>Harriette_Lakernick: CORW L8 CROW.. +14 256
#note (Counted as 17. Recounting opponent's play FAIL.)
>Jason: AKLORSV 8L .ALK +30 275
#note Considered, but passed on, L(UN)K. I'm surprised how far ahead it is in sim. (-6.4)
>Harriette_Lakernick: AD 11J DA. +31 287
>Jason: OORSVVY 2G V..Y +18 293
#note Near the top of a bad bunch of plays. Q likes OV(A) at M6, an interesting gambit. I need to learn to see those set-up type plays. (-1.5)
>Harriette_Lakernick: AEELTUU 7G .ULU +7 294
#note She played E(L)UATE, then picked it up to do this. Nice to know the unseen ?S was in the bag. Also nice that she must've whiffed on the -L hook to VINY ... ELUATE or LUAU there lead staticly.
>Jason: IIOORSV N5 OVO.I +16 309
#note Nearly missed this. That would've sucked.
>Harriette_Lakernick: BD D12 B..D +18 312
>Jason: IIRSTTY 9I YIR. +11 320
#note So frustrating that I don't have an O1 play. I was in terrible time shape at this point (about 3:00 left after this play, maybe?) and finally grew tired of looking and slapped something down. I wasn't too concerned about her O1 plays since the H is the only big tile out. Missed TITIS at O1 and TI(V)Y. (-6.8)
>Harriette_Lakernick: AEELN O1 ANELE +20 332
>Jason: AIISSTT N1 TI +10 330
#note Not a nice time for Noah's Ark over here. Now I was under two minutes, so I just blocked her best H spot and left one in the bag. Nearly fell over when I picked ?E. CP's clear pick is SI at J4. That wouldn't have occurred to me in a million years. (-23.3)
>Harriette_Lakernick: HINT M2 HINT +23 355
>Jason: ?AEISST B5 AScITES +65 395
#note Thanks to Jeff Fiszbein for teaching me this word a couple weeks ago. Shaky start to the tourney, but I erase my 0-2 record vs. Harriette. 
>Jason:  (EELU) +8 403
