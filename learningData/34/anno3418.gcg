#note I played this because it keeps a decent leave and opens the STAG hook for a bingo. Little did I realize that HOE does the same thing and keeps a better leave. -4

#note I passed up AUK 13G, the sim favorite, because I wanted to keep my bingo options open. EIST is a better leave than AEIST, though, and I have the STAG lane and the open RE in REJOIN for bingos anyway. A small mistake. -4
