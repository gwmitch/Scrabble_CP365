>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: HILPSUV 8G LUV +12 12
#note k8: i was giggling at woadwage options of LUVSHIP* and LUVHIPS*.
>Jason: ?AEIOUX I7 U.EA +9 9
#note Duck likes the X setup ... to a point. Still prefers EXU(V)IA. (-1)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EHINPRS J10 HIP +29 41
#note k8: there are bingos. sigh. i looked for AEHINPR and just didn't quite get there. i should get an anamonic. PAINER: FEMS PET GENT HECKLED. Yeah.
>Jason: ?GIOORX 12J .OX +24 33
#note One of my lasting memories from Chicago will be looking out at the room Monday morning ... knowing that most of the 118 people who weren't sitting at the table I was at would have liked to be there. I shared this with Kate before our round 19 game as a kind of encouragement but she wasn't in the mood to hear it. :)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EIINRST L12 .I +9 50
#note k8: for what it's worth, i saw the bingo as soon as the game was over, AND i do have an anamonic for the seven (woman shoved stuck flagpole), so at least there's that.
>Jason: ?DFGIOR K9 FID. +28 61
#note My favorite story from the weekend: Cahnmann calling Sunday night and saying that Kate had told him that she felt like a poser at the top table with Brian and Joel. But I was there, so that made her feel better. "Don't tell her this, but I feel the same way," I said. I heard laughter in the background. "Am I on speakerphone, g**d*** you?" I asked.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EINRSTT 13D RETINTS +68 118
#note k8: didn't feel like opening the triple lane more for the extra two points hooking XIS, but the J2 spot makes good sense.
>Jason: ?BGLORT 12B GLOB +22 83
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AABCIPS H11 PA.IC +30 148
>Jason: ?AGJORT B10 JO. +27 110
#note Considered burning the blank ... Q likes JAGGs or JAGGy there. (-2)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ABEINOS C9 BOI. +20 168
#note i dunno. i liked this leave better than keeping an I, and it scored okay. it opened the big scary A hook, but i couldn't find anything better. Q likes OBI G11 and BO C9. i prefer my play.
>Jason: ?AGORTW G3 WATeR.OG +67 177
#note Ooh, WARThOG at D4! (-21)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAEEENS H1 NEE +14 182
#note this move felt obvious to me at the time, but it doesn't even show up on quackle's top plays.
>Jason: ADEEFNT 8A DEAF +43 220
#note What a totally lame-brained mistake. Saw this was FATTENED-T, and then DIDN'T LOOK AT THE BOARD FOR AN OPEN T! When I noticed it while my hand was in the bag, I gasped. Embarrassing. I deserve to lose for that. (-54)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AADEMSZ F1 AMAZED +53 235
#note Nice. She would've had AMAZE for 85 if I had seen FATTENED.
#note k8: one of those, 'if only there were a disconnected A I for MAZAEDIAS*' - this is the kind of thing that isn't helpful during a game, especially since MAZAEDIA is already a plural.
>Jason: EEGKNST 14B SKEG +27 247
#note Didn't know K(ET)ENES. Decided to play the S for 10 more ... maybe a mistake. (-9)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ADILOST B1 SODALIT. +72 307
#note k8 - my brain was so done here. it took me a long time to find this stupid bingo.
>Jason: ?AENNRT J1 lANTERN +62 309
#note I may win after TANNERy, M6. I just couldn't stop thinking "Why'd I miss FATTENED, this game should be over..." (-8)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: LNOSVWY M11 WYN +38 345
#note k8 - WAVY 4A edges out my play in sim, but i prefer this. i want to keep the one scoring/blocking tile right now.
>Jason: ACEHORR A1 OH +26 335
#note Whoa, ARCH(F)OE for 44! (-20)
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ELOQSVY 1J .OVELY +45 390
#note k8 - the bag looks reasonably friendly, but there isn't really much i can do about it.  take the big score, draw one of the IIUU out of the bag and try to score with the Q.
>Jason: ACEIRRT L3 CIRRATE +75 410
#note Best in wins, somehow N5 placement almost 12 better in valuation.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: IMNQRSU 14M SUQ +34 424
#note jason says: "Nice play," I said. "If I have you tracked right!" Kate said. Don't know if I was tracked right, but good enough. The person who deserves it wins it.
#note k8 - the bag cooperates and gives me a good option.  this is one of those where if i did something dumb with tracking and he has an I, i'll have to kill myself.  happily, he didn't, so i live to play another game.
>Jason: EEU D8 .EE +20 430
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: IMNR 15N MI +49 473
>Jason: U 2E U. +4 434
#note Missing the seven-pointer. Glad Kate won to salvage a tough day.
>Jason:  (NR) +4 438
