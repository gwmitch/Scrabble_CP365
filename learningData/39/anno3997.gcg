#note I didn't know DeCENARY, the only bingo here. Of the non-bingo, Quackle likes BRANDY best easily, which seems right, as it is quite open. DEXY is also a favorite, saving B bingos and such, as well as CHILI.

#note Missing the better INCRuST. I should have gonewith my first instincts and played CISTeRNA, which wins a LOT more than anything besides INCRuST.
