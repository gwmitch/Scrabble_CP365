>Jeffrey: AABIMOS 8B ABOMASI +74 74
#note And my first OBAMA 7 played in club!(there are 12) Tim had this in a quiz at St. Johnsbury club back in October, I believe, and I have also drilled it before.  I vaguely remembered it as a biological word- it's the plural of ABOMASUM, the fourth stomach of a ruminant animal, for example a cow.  Quackle likes 8C best in the static eval., but I don't like the giveback of six vowel-adjacent DLS spots and and S going to the TWS -3.6
>Tim: IPY 9B YIP +23 23
>Jeffrey: EENTTVW 10D TEW +19 93
#note 10A plays like VENT or WENT much better, although with an open I, I like VENT for a leave -7.6
>Tim: AACT 7H ACTA +11 34
>Jeffrey: EKNNSTV K5 KN.VE +24 117
#note best
>Tim: DEIN 8K .INED +30 64
>Jeffrey: ?FNNPST H6 F..N +7 124
#note PST 10J slightly better, I could have at least made it F(AI)NT too -1.8
>Tim: AIORX L1 IXORA +32 96
>Jeffrey: ?EJNPST 3I JET.N +40 164
#note Best
>Tim: GHLNRU 1H HURL.NG +33 129
>Jeffrey: ?MOPRSU 11E MOP +27 191
#note Here I miss the confidence for the tricky s-hook for O1 and its best play, SUMP.  Hurling is a British sport like a combination of American football and field hockey, it seems.  Most of the sport -INGs take Ss.  I wouldn't have challenged if he had hooked it, that's fer shirr. I also missed bingoes like 4C SUPReMO, L8 (I)MPoROUS, and E1 SUPeRMO(M) though. -37.8 
>Tim: IQ G5 QI +16 145
>Jeffrey: ?AERSUU 2L .U +12 203
#note Ugh.  more O1 S-plays missed plus 12G AUtEURS, M8 (N)EURUlAS, J9 bUREAUS, and N5 URA(E)USEs. I just got shaken by the UU rack, I guess -27.2
>Tim: AEGHL B7 H..LAGE +16 161
#note I've never seen this one but it was only for 16 and set me up, so not worth challenging.
>Jeffrey: ?ADERSU 14A ASsURED +98 301
#note best second to SUpERAD(D) O1.  Lack of symmetry there, SUPERMOM is good but no SUPERDAD. - 18
>Tim: BNO 15F NOB +20 181
>Jeffrey: ACDOOOU 2F COO +16 317
#note DUO 12D better, or J5 OO(T)
>Tim: FY A13 F.Y +32 213
>Jeffrey: AADEOUW C11 DOW.E +40 357
#note best, although with a leave like AAU the points have to be great!
>Tim: GT 9J G.T +6 219
>Jeffrey: AADEIOU O6 AU.IO +6 363
#note 13G AUDIO is better, both for points and taking out bingo lanes, -2.5
>Tim: ?EEEILV -  +0 219
>Jeffrey: ?ADELTZ N4 LEZ +63 426
#note I know TEAZLeD 12F (somehow got distracted and didn't play it) but didn't see wALTZED.  I saw ADZ at the same spot but there was another LE left and no AD, so I figured it was worth preventing the dupes  -11.7
>Tim: R 6F R.. +8 227
>Jeffrey: ?ADEEET I3 .EE +10 436
#note Probably pretty unwise for me to not block lanes 12 & 13 here, still trying to score one last binger give my conducive tiles.  Q likes 12E ETA -4.2
>Tim: EILRRST A1 TIRLERS +79 306
>Tim: EILRRST --  -79 227
#note I know TIRL is a sound, and have never seen this LISTER branch.  It does look close to BIRLERS, who are log-rollers.  In his position I would have fished one last time by playing off the R, like 12B (GO)R.  It turns out the remaining tile pool was IS, so he would have had either 12F SILTIER or A1 LISTERS.
>Jeffrey: ?ADEITV A1 DEVIATe +87 523
#note best is TArDIVE A1 -4
>Tim: EILRRST N10 TIRLS +18 245
>Jeffrey: IS O1 SI +42 565
#note ...and so now, with little to lose I make the (HURLING)S play, and it comes back good...
>Jeffrey:  (ER) +4 569
