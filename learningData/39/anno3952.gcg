>David_Koenig: ADIW 8G WADI +16 16
>Pete: AEEEINN 9F NENE +18 18
#note I like this play... It finishes with ANE and NEE at the top. I liked what this play did to the board.  
>David_Koenig: DINT 10G DINT +21 37
>Pete: AAEEILM H8 ...MALIA +33 51
#note my phony crushes all the legitimate plays.  Didn't even draw a hold, which might have a little to do with his next play.
>David_Koenig: BDIIJLR 12G J.ILBIRD +86 123
>Pete: ?CEEEHR M6 CHEERE.s +84 135
#note The best of the many bingoes.
>David_Koenig: QTU 14F QU.T +33 156
>Pete: HIOORRS 8L H.RO +33 168
#note If SHOO hadn't left so bad, I probably would have picked it... I also considered ORRIS... but HERO wins sim. 
>David_Koenig: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 156
>Pete: IIORRSY O8 .RRIS +26 194
#note my weakness on 4s costs me.  SORI is best by a freaking ton.  
>David_Koenig: EE J12 .EE +21 177
>Pete: EIIOPSY 15D POI +19 213
#note at this point, I feel fairly in control... I'm resolved to keep it tight, build a rack and make him open.  POI wins sim.
>David_Koenig: ACDELS 15J SCALED +34 211
>Pete: EEIMRSY 14N YE +23 236
#note Easily best.  Also considered the cute HEM 7M, which scored less, left worse, but used a cool hook I learned a few weeks ago.
>David_Koenig: OPU 7E UPO +15 226
>Pete: AEIMRSV 6G VIM +20 256
#note I liked my play holding an A and a strong leave.  Duck preferred MAVIS, which I find too aggressive here.  
>David_Koenig: AFLOT 5G ALOFT +35 261
>Pete: AEGRSUV 8A VAGUS +32 288
#note So depressing.  I see my cool seven, but DK's nice prior play blocks it.  My play is best by a ton, nearly 10%.
>David_Koenig: BKN B7 B.NK +20 281
>Pete: AEGIRXY E4 GYR.. +18 306
#note I actually missed the X spot on this play... While my play is cute, it's well behind AX, or even YEAR 4I.
>David_Koenig: AEG C6 GA.E +16 297
>Pete: AEFIOOX 11K AX. +37 343
#note It took me way too long to see the X spot, leading to time trouble.  Best.
>David_Koenig: ATU D2 UTA +12 309
>Pete: EFINOOW 2B FO. +12 355
#note I read this play as an attempt to open either a bingo line or a big Z play of some sort.  FOU kills the line, and with me holding the case I, requires the blank for him to make a big Z play.  FOU finishes second at 69% to the counterintuitive FOOT at 74%.
>David_Koenig: ENOOSTT 1A SOT +16 325
#note Best.  he kills my best Z spot, while keeping BANKNOTE alive and leaving other outs available.
>Pete: ?EINOWZ F2 ZeE +35 390
#note I was time short, and had him mistracked.  sOZIN is best, but my play does the job.  
>David_Koenig: ENOT B7 ....NOTE +28 353
>David_Koenig:  (INOW) +14 367
