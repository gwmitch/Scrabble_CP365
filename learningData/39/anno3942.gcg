>Jason: AEELOST 8C OLEATES +66 66
#note Nice to open up with a no-brainer. The placement will prove significant shortly.
>Brian_Cappelletto: CDEILOO 7I OCELOID +65 65
#note Thanks to Sam Rosin's annotations for teaching me this word. :)
>Jason: AAEOUUW -AAOUUW +0 66
>Brian_Cappelletto: ADEHNSS E4 DASH.ENS +98 163
#note I believe this can be classified as a momentum swing. Maybe I should start considering the letter I slot for double-doubles when deciding on bingo placement.
>Jason: DEKLOOW O4 WOO.ED +45 111
#note Phew ... WOODLIKE, LAKEWOOD, KEELWOOD are all bad. This is best.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AGUZ K3 GAUZ. +30 193
>Jason: AEIKLMT D1 KAMI +36 147
#note Missed MOATLIKE and MASTLIKE. And (GAUZE)LIKE. (-49)
>Brian_Cappelletto: CEFRU 1A FUC.ER +45 238
>Jason: AEGIILT G2 LITIGA.E +62 209
#note Four naturals in eight turns. It was definitely a far prettier board than our first game.
>Brian_Cappelletto: ENRTW N5 TW.NER +39 277
>Jason: IIOPQTT H1 QI +35 244
>Brian_Cappelletto: INN I1 INN +18 295
>Jason: IOPRTTY M9 POTTY +37 281
#note I can't really complain about how this game unfolded. This is the third play in a row Brian left option A open when I really had no option B.
>Brian_Cappelletto: AEEMNRR C3 MARE +28 323
#note (Brian's exact rack.)
>Jason: HINRTVY 4J V.RY +20 301
>Brian_Cappelletto: ??AEINR A1 .IbRAnNE +80 403
>Jason: EHILNTU 9B UH +18 319
#note One mistake in nine turns and my win percentage is under 1. That's the thing about the greats: They slice and dice you so skillfully that you don't even notice you're bleeding to death.
>Brian_Cappelletto: DERU 10G DURE +18 421
>Jason: EIJLNOT M2 JO. +26 345
#note Or JOEY. JET(T)ON, 12J, leads in valuation. (-6)
>Brian_Cappelletto: AB 2M .AB +24 445
>Jason: BEILNTV N1 B. +4 349
#note Wanted to play from the U in DURE ... missed UNVEIL. Fishing for VENALIT(Y). (-5)
>Brian_Cappelletto: AFIOPSX 12J FIX. +28 473
#note Duck says it's two better one row up.
>Jason: EGILNTV 13G GIVEN +22 371
#note UNVEIL hurts me again. (-15)
>Brian_Cappelletto: AOPS 11K PO.S +41 514
