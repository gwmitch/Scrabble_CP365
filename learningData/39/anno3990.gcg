#note Saw SCROUNGER, but wasn't sure of it. This pay sucks. Quackle likes setting up O with GNUS I guess. I don't like giving my opp an easy 30-50 points personally. GUNROOM is its second favorite, which I don't really know.

#note I like this play a lot. It empties the bag, but it does leave me with five tiles. It blocks almost all bingos, and looks like it only opens a few (a quick check with Zyzzyva tells me PEIgNOIR, PROcHEIN, and PYRENOId are the only ones). It also looks like it takes care of gigantic Z plays. Champ player likes fishing, and this isn't even on its radar, so I simmed Champ Player's choices with this many-ply. Ultimately, Quackle prefers SUB or US (at either spot) after a 3769 iteration sim. Maybe because of the decent score and great chance of bingoing, but this seems more like a blocking situation than a bingoing situation to me. Thoughts?
