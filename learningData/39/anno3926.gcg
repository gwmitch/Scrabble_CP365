>Lisa_Odom: INZ 8G ZIN +24 24
>Jason: BDORRYY 7H BODY +18 18
#note Missed BRYO(N)Y. (-8)
>Lisa_Odom: CR K5 CR. +16 40
>Jason: EFPRRTY J7 .EFY +32 50
#note Duck likes FE(R)RY instead. I can see that. (-4)
>Lisa_Odom: OU 10J .OU +6 46
>Jason: EOPRRTT M9 TROPE +23 73
#note Knowing that Lisa was close, I don't like a play like PRETOR, which gives back the triple. PR(U)TOT's a cool word I didn't know. (-3)
>Lisa_Odom: ?ALNOSU N4 zONULAS +72 118
#note Maybe for three more at 9B?
>Jason: AEHIRTU O6 AHI +31 104
#note Duck likes UH, L12. I don't. And I can't understand how the one extra point for HIE sims better, too. The A-ZINE hook that important? I'd still play this. (-3)
>Lisa_Odom: BCEI 12I BICE. +22 140
>Jason: AEINRTU F6 URANITE +75 179
#note As Chuck might say, my last play was proven right. :)
>Lisa_Odom: EVX E4 VEX +35 175
>Jason: AAMORRT O1 RAMA +23 202
#note I know AAMR has two anagrams. "RAMA/MARA," I think. No, it's MAAR/MARA. I always type in RAMA first, though. My brain didn't get to the "not RAMA, but..." part. At least I got away with it. But it doesn't excuse missing MORA in that spot. (-4)
>Lisa_Odom: LOSW N12 SLOW +28 203
>Jason: AAINORT 15M A.A +18 220
#note Giving Lisa an S, this leads sim.
>Lisa_Odom: AEHLSTT 13A HALTEST +80 283
#note Best*. High-prob enough that I should know the real bingo, which doesn't play here.
>Jason: EINOPRT 10A POINT.ER +62 282
#note Must've missed TERPINO(L); it's clearly better. (-1)
>Lisa_Odom: EF N1 EF +22 305
#note This play mystified me. I assume Lisa's close ... but where's she going to bingo?
>Jason: ADEGTVW A12 W.AT +42 324
>Lisa_Odom: GJ C9 J.G +19 324
>Jason: DEEGLOV A4 DEVELO. +45 369
#note Very happy to see this. One of my favorite plays of the tourney; wins sim by a mile.
>Lisa_Odom: D 5A .D +3 327
#note Ruh-roh.
>Jason: GIINOQU B2 QUO. +31 400
#note Nearly played (A)GO at B13 to block the only lane, until I saw REMISED/EDS was probable given the pool. Sans inference, sims best. Even if she bingos from the T, GIN (maybe KIN) at C1 could outrun.
>Lisa_Odom: I 2B .I +11 338
>Jason: GGIIINN C2 .NN +14 414
#note Not the prettiest rack in Scrabble history, but the duplicate Ns do the job of blocking SMERKED at 1C. Lisa has nothing from the T no matter what's in the bag. CP only mentions GINNI(ER), but this is also a guaranteed win.
>Lisa_Odom: ?DEEKMS 4I DESK +27 365
#note Was surprised Lisa made this play relatively quickly. Figured she'd use up most of her time looking for a miracle (like SEEDMaK(ER)*, as Joey suggested).
>Jason: GGIIIR 15A .RIG +7 421
#note Thought I was taking away her best out. Missed EM(E)u at 12D.
>Lisa_Odom: ?EM 3H rEM +13 378
#note And so did she.
>Lisa_Odom:  (GII) +8 386
