#note This sims pretty evenly with 4F ADZED 37 and 4J DAZES 37 and 4J DAZE 35.
>Steve_Grob: EILRSTU 9H RUTILES +61 175
>Brendan_Sullivan: GINPSSW M3 P.W +16 115
#note I felt like GINSS could pay off quickly, and this gave me an extra S hook. N9 SWINGS 36 sims well, and I guess taking points when they're available this early in the game is usually right.

#note Gah* I saw SEISING and thought, "Wait, SEISE isn't a verb or a word!" Yes, it is both.

#note I ran through this anagram set in my head but somehow still didn't spot that PAVISES plays at A2 for 95.

#note 1F BUOY 35 sims better; ERT is a nice leave.

#note I wasn't thrilled about oopening a bingo spot on row 11, but I didn't see any enticing alternatives. Had I seen it, N4 DOBRAS 20 would probably be my move.
>Steve_Grob: ADEILNO 2B DO +11 311
#note Steve told me his rack here after the game.

>Brendan_Sullivan: EILNOPR N13 PI +16 366
#note I was pretty much baffled here. I have to assume he has the S based on previous moves, so AC(I)ERATE isn't a threat. That leaves CESAREA(N), which is why I felt compelled to play at this spot. I already had used up a lot of time on previous moves and this one, already, and wanted to leave at least a minute and a half for the final rack.
>Steve_Grob: AEK A1 KAE +25 360
>Brendan_Sullivan: CELNORT K7 CO.NER +16 382
#note At this point, we are both low on time (I had about 0:30 when I hit my clock after this move, and Steve had about 0:10) so the endgame is messy and shoddily-played. I didn't have enough time to look for underlaps around the board, so playing through the I seemed best and my brain just froze and I played the first (and pretty much only) word I thought of.
>Steve_Grob: AEEERS 13H ERASE +15 375
#note J8 STERE is a game winner, as are L11 SEER/REES setting up TEA/TAXI next.
