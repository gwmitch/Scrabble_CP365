#note Very tough position with no good plays available. ENG I7 might be slightly better.

>Bing: EPPSSTV 12B PEPS +24 73
#note Another unappetizing choice. VETS, keeping PPS, is possibly a little stronger (4I to take the TEGG hook).

#note Seemed like a good idea. I didn't like to give up on the rack with SOAVE.
