#note Really didnt want to risk OVERDUST. My plan was to play OVERT, kinda forcing him to play with the O and get a double double off next turn.

#note Quite a strong dump
>Goutham: EGIMNOR 2L MIG. +31 316
#note Really wasnt too sure what to play here. I think i should have tried fishing for either AEGIRINE or GERMAINE but that would require me getting it immediately the next turn. (Basically i need to dump the O and pick the A straight. It was something i was considering but i felt playing MIGG and scoring just was better. Looking back though, i had no real options to bingo next turn so that was probably a bad play. Probably should have just fished off MO by playing MOL and pray that i get AEGIRINE. Also can pick up EARNING or ANGRIES etc.
