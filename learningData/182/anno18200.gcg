>Mack_: ACEEGOS 8F EGO +8 8
#note Chose this placement over 8H to put an O in the H column instead of an E. The only hook is an S on either side, so that factor is immaterial. Quackle actually likes 8H by half a percent, but I think I like 8F for the above reason.
>Joey: ADIQ 9C QAID +27 27
>Mack_: ACEGINS I5 CEASING +67 75
#note This looks more defensive than INCAGES since it exposes fewer floaters and the C is effective for blocking the upper right quadrant.
>Joey: AGILNRV 6F RAV.LING +66 93
>Mack_: EIPSTWX 10B PIX +38 113
#note L4 is too easy for Joey to use after XI, so this is better.
>Joey: ?AINORU 11F ORI.ANUm +66 159
>Mack_: BEOOSTW 12D BOW +21 134
#note I thought about BESTOW in the same spot to score more and go for more turnover, but decided that going for the bingo was more important here than garnering another 14 points. Quackle agrees by over 2%.
>Joey: AINU 13B UNAI +14 173
>Mack_: EHOSTVY K2 YESH.VOT +84 218
>Joey: AY 10H A.Y +29 202
>Mack_: ABEIIOZ 3I ZO.AE +48 266
#note I figured that Joey probably kept decent tiles, and possibly an S, on his last play so couldn't bring myself to do ZOmBIE. Since I will be up nearly 70, I went for ZOEAE, the lower variance play. ZOmBIE is crushing the sim, but I definitely prefer ZOEAE here.
>Joey: DE 12D ...ED +21 223
>Mack_: BEIIIJL F2 JIBE. +30 296
#note This looks best, as JUBILE is way too reckless here.
>Joey: CEOPT 3B POET.C +26 249
>Mack_: EHIILOR M9 HO.IER +24 320
#note Failed to consider 4A HEIR/HEIL for some reason, but this play actually sims better anyway. I'm not really sure why, though, since the 8K spot isn't too dangerous given the pool and HEIL scores more while keeping a slightly more vowel-heavy leave, which is good considering the consonant heavy pool. I'd definitely play HEIL if I had to do it over.
>Joey: EFKR 4A KERF +48 297
>Mack_: ?AILNRU N4 INsULAR +79 399
>Joey: EFU -  +0 297
#note Seeing no other hope to win, Joey challenged.
>Mack_: DDMMRTW L10 M.M +27 426
#note I figured this play left me quite likely to draw into something at O1.
>Joey: EFU 13G FEU +26 323
