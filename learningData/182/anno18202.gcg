>Mack_: CENRSUV M9 V.NUE +24 56
#note While I didn't like giving back the A hook, I didn't want to sacrifice so many points with VAU and liked CRS much better than NRS, hence not L8 CURVE. Another upside to VENUE is that, while Robin is very likely to have a back hook to CURVE, VENUE only takes the S. Quackle actually likes VAC, which I definitely wouldn't do, in a short sim.
>Robin: ADTU 8L DAUT +30 113
>Mack_: CINORRS 9H .OR +15 71
#note This looks about as good as it gets here -- it scores and unduplicates my Rs, leaving me in good shape to bingo soon.
>Robin: AEIIMNT O2 INTIMA.E +61 174
>Mack_: CIIINRS 3K RICI. +14 85
#note As unappealing as this is, there isn't really much else. K10 ACINI is worse since it blocks the AVENUES hook.
>Robin: A 7H .A +12 186
>Mack_: BEHINST 14G HENBITS +78 163
>Robin: AEILORT 8A AEROLIT. +77 263
>Mack_: BDDEERS D5 DES.RBED +74 237
#note Rats, I saw BEDDERS but immediately dismissed it thinking it was phoney. This is about 5% worse according to a sim.
>Robin: HPW H12 PH.W +45 308
>Mack_: ?AAANUW 2I AWA +16 253
#note At this point, being down 70 points and a tempo, I felt I needed either one very high scoring bingo or two bingos, so chose to further open the board with this play.
>Robin: AGLO 1H GAOL +25 333
>Mack_: ?AGIJNU 5C A.JUrING +82 335
>Robin: FOY E11 FOY +31 364
>Mack_: EFNNORX L10 .EX +40 375
#note Very bad -- missed 11K XENON here, which is much better. As it turns out it wouldn't have made a difference, but a bad mistake nonetheless.
>Robin: EGILLST A5 LEG.LIST +60 424
>Mack_: FINNOPR B6 FO. +30 405
>Robin: Q 2N Q. +44 468
>Mack_: INNPRTU 10A .N +4 409
#note At this stage in the tournament any remote chance of winning is more important than a few spread points, so I choose to fish for the blank for TURNIPs and hope Robin somehow messes up.
>Robin: ?CEOOVY 14A COVEs +27 495
>Mack_: INOPRTU 4H PI +16 425
