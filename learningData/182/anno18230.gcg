#note 1:55.
>Mack: ADGILNV 4J LAVING +28 50
#note I was somewhat reluctant to blow up my rack, but this looks fine.
>Joey: BDESTTY O4 .YBED +36 54
#note 0:25.  Scored as 39.  Had I known it was only 36 I might have played BITTY, which would have changed the dynamic quite a bit.
>Mack: ACDFRST M3 D.SFRACT +86 136
>Mack: ACDFRST --  -86 50
#note Wow. I really thought this was good. A smart and good challenge by Joey.
>Joey: IRSTTTT -TTT +0 54
#note 0:58.  I was saved by the DRASTIC: BOIL PET anamonic, otherwise challenging would not have been as easy.
>Mack: ACDFRST M3 F.D +14 64
#note Thought about DRIFT to set up ADRIFT, but given that Joey knows I have an A and that he ay very well have an A this seems better.
>Joey: AILRRST 8G L.R +3 57
#note 1:00.  Not exactly lighting up the scoreboard lately.
>Mack: ACJORST G3 JO. +25 89
#note Also considered CAJON, but given that Joey fished off two consonants didn't want to give him the A in the double double lane.
>Joey: AEIRSTT N8 ARTIEST +71 128
#note 0:21.
>Mack: ACIORST 11H AORIST.C +70 159
#note 0:21.  Drat, I wish I had played IRATEST.
>Joey: AGLLMTU H11 .LGUM +27 155
>Mack: ?EETVWY 6J WYE +37 196
>Joey: AAEILOT M11 .OEA +16 171
#note 0:31.  Usually I would keep an E, but there were many unseen.
>Mack: ?EFKSTV L9 VE.T +20 216
#note As awkward as this play looks, there isn't much else. K10 KIF, the other move I debated, sims about 3% worse.
>Joey: ADHILNT 10I HAL. +20 191
#note 0:56.
>Mack: ?FIKQSU 14G K.FI +13 229
#note I figured that, being down 40 on a closed board, Joey will often open the board and give me a good spot for my Q.
>Joey: DIINNRT 9C INDRI +11 202
#note 1:55.  Still looking for E's (and blanks)
>Mack: ?EOQRSU 8A ROQUE +62 291
#note I saw pIROQUES (missed cONQUERS but that is barely better), but this is clearly better than the bingoes here.
>Joey: ENNOPTU E2 UNOPEN.. +22 224
#note 2:03.  This board was that.
>Mack: ?EIIMSU F6 MU +22 313
#note Tough call here. I wanted to leave the R open so that I could have a shot at a counterbingo if Joey bingoed. This play is not bad, but D3 EMU looks better to unload the extra vowel.
>Joey: ?BEERTT A1 BaTTERE. +80 304
#note I forgot to write down my times from this point on.
>Mack: ?EEIISS 10B IS +16 329
#note I hated maing this play, but I was down to about a minute on my clock and had to play something. Apparently I should play 3A TIE, which wins 73% to IS's 60%.
>Joey: ACEIOXZ 12D ZOEA. +28 332
#note Actual rack. Joey said after the game that he wanted to block the possibility of AIrHOLES, and was considering a number of plays such as this, COXAL, A10 AZOIC, and ZOECIAL*. Given that I have B2 HOISE at a bare minimum and probably A10 ASHIEr, it will be very difficult for Joey to outrun me as he needs to make up about 70 points on two turns. It seems very difficult for Joey to win with a valid play, so might forcing me to challenge off the phoney ZOECIAL* be the way to go? Given that I am in severe time pressure, I may incorrectly assume I can still win without challenging it off. As it turns out I was pretty sure it was phoney so almost definitely would have challenged, but given my time pressure I could definitely see it working sometimes. This is a very tough call though, and no move seems clearcut.
>Mack: ?AEEHIS A10 ASHIEr +39 368
#note Not much I can add to what Mack said.
