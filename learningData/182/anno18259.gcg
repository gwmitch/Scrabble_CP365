#note Yes i know this is garbage but challenging it off really doesnt do me any good.
>Goutham: ?AENPST O8 Pa.EANTS +149 244
#note Pretty obvious that i shouldnt challenge here. Anything i bingo allows him to destroy my life.
>Sinatarn: TV D4 V.T +12 222
#note Another bingo coming my way sigh

>Goutham: AAHOOUZ 14G OUZO +34 383
#note OUZO is primarily to block off the last bingo line.
>Sinatarn: EJ 6B JE. +31 379
#note I have the momentum of the game now, especially since i drew a H last turn.
>Goutham: AAHHORW 13B WHOAH +51 434
>Goutham: AAHHORW --  -51 383
#note A couple of things you can learn from here.

1. Never play phoneys
2. The words u use in daily life can decieve you.
3. Think carefully before playing your move
4. Never play phoneys and
5. Never play phoneys.

Yes i said never play phoneys 3 times, but that is just that important.

Even WHOA would have been a bad play. I should have just play WHA keeping the other H to either score HAO at 6N or with the C at C12.
>Sinatarn: ILNR 11K R.N +12 391
#note This may not have been the best play but then again i dont know what was on his rack. He may only have had one vowel  and none of the few strong tiles left but again i'm not too sure. 
>Goutham: AAHHORW 11E WHA +35 418
#note Atleast now i came to my senses
>Sinatarn: EIMNR C9 MIN.ER +26 417
#note Pretty much know he has the S now.
>Goutham: AHIKORU N6 HAO +35 453
#note I thought a long time here and i do believe the correct play is HAO for 35. I was considering play AUK,ROK,HOKA,OUK etc but he could play something like BOYS that will completely destroy me. By playing HAO i actually do score about the same as dumping the K and i force him into a bad position next turn. If he scores with MINCERS or OHS, I can play the K for over 40 points and still win. If he blocked the K spot, which he did, i could still play KEY at 3K which will still narrowly give me the win. In other words, picking up the K and not laying it down immediately won me this game (and thus i reiterate the importance of carefully considering your options before doing anything) 
>Sinatarn: BDLOOST B8 LOB +25 442
#note I had YUKE for 40 over points so he couldnt really play BLOODS/OHS. He opted to play LOB instead.
