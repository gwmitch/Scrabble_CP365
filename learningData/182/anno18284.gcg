>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEINRS 8G SANDIER +68 68
#note Best choice apparently.
>Betty_Cornelison: IP J8 .IP +12 12
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEEIWY 7G EYE +19 87
#note Missing EYEWEA(R) is bad, Q's optimal. This is almost 17pts back!

>Betty_Cornelison: CEILLOS 11D COLLIES +75 87
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEIIRSW K4 AIRW.SE +26 113
#note WIRIE(R) and WARIE(R) I both saw, but I justified this because it scored more and expended and S that wasn't particularly useful on this board...but maybe that's not entirely accurate reasoning due to row 9. AIRW(I)SE is 4.3 back.
>Betty_Cornelison: DDEOZ L10 DOZED +38 125
#note DOZED can be played for 5 more in a stealther location. 12I.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?AEGIRT D4 ARGEnTI. +70 183
#note I was actually laying down REA(C)TING, seriously, but assumed it didn't fit. Blah. That was the proper play.
>Betty_Cornelison: AH M12 AH +31 156
>Gunther_Jacobi: EMMOQUY L1 QUEY +62 245
>Betty_Cornelison: FILT 8A FLI.T +21 177
>Gunther_Jacobi: EGMMOTU M3 MEM +28 273
#note Q's top is MUG N10, and leads over any alternative by at least 5pts. I avoided plays there for defensive purposes along with the fact I wanted to save my U for row A.
>Betty_Cornelison: FINX H11 .NFIX +48 225
>Gunther_Jacobi: ABGNOTU 1L .UAG +42 315
>Betty_Cornelison: BBVV -BBVV +0 225
>Gunther_Jacobi: BGNOSTV N10 BOG +25 340
#note It was between this and VOT(I)NG, Q's top. My instincts were saying VOTING but something made me play BOG, which is really only 1.0 worse than VOTING.
>Betty_Cornelison: ACO O8 OCA +19 244
>Gunther_Jacobi: DHNNSTV I6 V..D +16 356
>Betty_Cornelison: ?AEENOT B4 ANTE.OpE +59 303
#note E(l)ONGATE is the highest scorer.
>Gunther_Jacobi: HIJNNST A1 JINN +39 395
>Betty_Cornelison: OPU N5 UPO +15 318
#note The same play at C3 is very clever, but closes a lane.
