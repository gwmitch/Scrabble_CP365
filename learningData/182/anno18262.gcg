#note Something to note here would be that Martin overdrew one tile and i was able to get the last E off his rack and into the bag.

Knowing this i really should not have played revoke right off the bat.  The right play i think is to have played either DIVE or DIKE and threaten a bingo. With 3 Is left and plenty of nice tiles left as well, i think i would have had a decent shot of drawing a bingo. That would cause Martin to have to block there and allow me to play along the A column and score. Without the E, Martin would also have been unable to really do much at the A column. REVOKE now that i think more about it was really quite a bad move. WHATS MORE I EMPTY THE BAG LEAVING ME WITH 7 TILES TOO... No way i can out in 2 before him then.

#note Yeah he just wins pretty easily if i play revoke. DIKE would have been much better
