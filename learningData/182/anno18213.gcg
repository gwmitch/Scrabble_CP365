>Mack: BEEITVY 8E BEVY +24 24
#note Chose this placement since the Y is harder to bingo to than the E. Quackle agrees in a short sim.
>Joey: ?DEIORU E6 tU.EROID +70 70
#note 1:45.  Special thanks to Mack for his racks and commentary in this game.
>Mack: EEFIIRT D1 FEIRIE +27 51
#note Also considered D4 FIE to go for a bingo since I am down. I ultimately chose this since it scores more and goes for the esses and remaining blank more. The two plays sim virtually equally.
>Joey: ABEEFSS 1A BAF.S +39 109
#note 0:29.  Seems like a waste of an S, but it doesn't really help much to keep it.
>Mack: HMNRTVZ 3C M.RTH +28 79
#note I figured this placement of MIRTH kept open more lanes, which is desirable since I am losing. The two placements sim within half a percent of each other, along with 12D VIM, which I really don't understand at all.
>Joey: AEEEIST 10A EATE.IES +62 171
#note 0:18.  Having the right floater sure came in handy.
>Mack: DKNOTVZ A6 ZONK.D +60 139
#note And it came in handy for Mack too.  60 points with a TV.  What more could you ask for?
>Joey: ADNOQST D12 QAT +49 220
#note 0:15.  Nothing like a couple of quickies.
>Mack: IOTTUUV C13 TUI +16 155
#note I really had no idea what to do here. I missed the stylish (QI)VIUT, which definitely looks best here. I was debating between TUI and exchanging, and ultimately decided the 16 points was just worth it. I should probably have traded though, given that I am in an 80-point deficit.
>Joey: ?DLNORS 11G RONDeLS +68 288
#note 0:55. Just making sure no other bingo was available.  (There wasn't)
>Mack: AOOTUVW 2G AVOW +23 178
#note At this point nothing even wins 1% of the time. This looks about as good as it will get for this turn.
>Joey: AAAMNNX 12G AX +38 326
#note 0:30.  I carelessly missed the 2A spot.
>Mack: GLORTUW M4 LUGWORT. +67 245
#note (Mack) If I want any shot whatsoever at winning, I pretty much have to try this. I figured there was a good chance I could slip it by Joey, since LUGWORM, LUNGWORM, and LUNGWORT are good but no LUGWORT*.
(Joey) I knew that.  Just wanted to give you the impression that you could sneak something by me in the future.  ;)
>Joey: AAIMNNP 8L M.AN +27 353
#note 1:38.
>Mack: EGHLNOO F5 OH +26 271
#note This looks fine, but matters are still extremely bleak -- 1.3% to win in a short sim.
>Joey: AEGIJNP L1 JAPE +46 399
#note 0:17.
>Mack: EEGLNOR J8 GOL.ENER +64 335
>Joey: AAGIINY 15H AI.ING +24 423
#note 1:16.  I didn't think RAYING was good.  I must have confused it with TRAYING*.
>Mack: EEIILOT 1L .OLE +33 368
#note I thought about fishing for ELECTION and NONELITE, but that seems pointless as Joey will just block. I thus opted to play for spread with JOLE.
>Joey: ACDNPSY N12 DAPS +22 445
#note 3:46.  I thought he had NEUSTIC to go out but my tracking was off.  ADUNC 5K is best.
>Mack: CEIITU O7 I.CITE +13 381
#note The best endgame, as it forces Joey to take the lower scoring out of I1 CONY instead of 13L CYAN.
>Joey: CNY I1 C.NY +10 455
#note 0:34.  Time of game: 33:01 (11:44 for me, 21:17 for Mack)
>Joey:  (U) +2 457
