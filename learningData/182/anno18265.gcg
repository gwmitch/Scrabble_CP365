#note How did you know i had another U waiting haha
>Goutham: CDEINSU L5 INDUCES +73 332
#note I kinda just had this feeling that Tony was waiting to lay down SHOEINGS so i just went for it.
>Tony: EM 14E EM +33 295
#note I admit i thought HAEMS was invalid. It's actually HAETS that is invalid.
>Goutham: ADLNORV K3 VOL +16 348
#note Yeah i kinda knew JIVE_ will cost me dearly but at the same time i wanted to close the board off (Was still thinking HAEMS wasnt good)
>Tony: EIRZ 3K .EZIR +34 329
>Goutham: ADNORTT N1 TR.TON +16 364
#note Took like 7 minutes to make my move here.
I was considering may options here but all of them were unable to block the board off. So at the end i just disposed as many tiles as possible, opening up 2 scoring lines to give me an insurance when Tony scores off of one of the lines.
I admit ROTTAN or RATTON would have been better.
>Tony: MTU 1L MU.T +27 356
>Goutham: ADGJN O5 DANG +23 387
#note Did not record down my rack sadly. Pretty sure DANG was really the only thing i could play though anyway.
>Tony: ANNY 13J .ANNY +20 376
#note CANY may have been better, not exposing the Y to the double.
