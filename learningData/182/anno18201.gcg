>Robin: EEE -EEE +0 0
>Mack_: DEGJNTV -DGJV +0 0
#note I could try to play through with VEND or JET, but given that Robin probably has a strong rack I preferred to groom my rack.
>Robin: EEEE -EEEE +0 0
>Mack_: ELNTTTW -LTTW +0 0
#note The same logic from the previous turn applied here, hence my passing up WELT.
>Robin: ?AEGNSS 8D GAyNESS +68 68
>Mack_: AELLNRT E8 .L +2 2
#note Ignoring six-pass scenarios, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the first time someone has averaged only two-thirds of a point over the first three turns. 
>Robin: DDIKO I3 KIDDO. +18 86
>Mack_: AELNRTT J8 .LATTERN +62 64
>Robin: DEFIIOT G8 .OTIFIED +64 150
>Mack_: AILNRRY 14B INLAY.R +36 100
#note Saw ANILITY on the double double, but especially being down almost 90 wanted to get rid of the second R. Quackle concurs in a short sim.
>Robin: EOO 15F O.EO. +29 179
>Mack_: AAEIORS 3I .ORAI +18 118
#note Didn't notice the stylish K9 ARIOSE, but I like this better given my deficit.

>Robin: EHIINN 1G HINNIE. +33 278
>Mack_: ACMOPTT 8L ..PT +27 253
#note At this point I figured I'd need to bingo to win, so opted to open another lane while keeping a strong leave. A short sim agrees with my choice.
>Robin: EJT 2F JET +33 311
>Mack_: ACEGMOT E5 CAT..OG +40 293
>Robin: MOY 3E YOM +31 342
>Mack_: EFGMOUW D12 GU.F +24 317
#note Waffled between this and WOLF, but decided on this due to the two unseen Us. 
>Robin: DHI K11 HID +32 374
>Mack_: ?EEMOUW M11 WE +19 336
#note Though the pool is junky, I won't be able to outrun Robin without a bingo since she often has plays like 10B ZERO and, at a bare minimum, 13I ZED available. While it would be ideal to open up another lane, there really is no good way to do so with this rack. I could do 13A EM, but the WU combo is too hideous to keep. As bingoing through the I in INLAYER seems impossible, I basically have to hope to draw something to the T and have Robin not block. While this seems extremely unlikely, I don't have much other hope in this position.
>Robin: AV O8 .AV +6 380
>Mack_: ?EMORRU 4K OM. +23 359
#note I can actually cut the loss to 8 points if I find F6 MaYOR, as Robin's best play is then 13I ZED and I go out with K3 RECUR. I was under severe time pressure, though, and had to lay something down.
>Robin: BERUVZ 10B ZER. +33 413
>Mack_: ?ERRU 13M ERR +18 377
>Robin: BUV 6D V.U +8 421
>Mack_: ?U B10 .Uz +11 388
#note -10 to me for overtime, so 421-384 final score.
>Mack_:  (B) +6 394
