#note So now at this point in the game, i knew that there were 2 Fs left with an I and an O left. (I had an I) The 5 letter word with the F is kinda obvious here but he actually played QAT instead.
>Goutham: DEEIRSV 15C VERDI.ES +63 406
#note Since Manop played QAT instead of going ballistic with the F, i was thinking he either does not have it or is just holding onto it (Which he probably wouldnt because i could have it too so you should really just take it as soon as the opportunity presents itself.) So my options were to play DIVER, DIVERS or VERDITES (I did not know SKIVERED sadly, that would have been the best play regardless). I was thinking since he probably doesnt have the F play ready, i should just bingo. DIVERS would have been the better play if i were to assume that he would have the F play ready. I also didnt really know whether he had both vowels or just 1. If he just had 1 (which he did) then DIVERS would definitely be the play to make. He would have to use his one vowel to score and i still will have 2 to outscore him and win. Honestly i had hoped he would just play the F instead of QAT (as he should have done if he had it) so i could play DERIVES and just seal the game.
>Manop: FGIMNRS 14J FIRMS +52 428
#note Sadly he did have the F play available. Whether he just drew it off the 2 tiles from the bag, i dont really know. But either way i have lost at this point.
I calculated that DIVERS would have won me the game given he had this rack.

#note Really all i can do now
>Manop: GN K1 G.N +6 434
>Manop:  (G) +4 438
#note I guess the probability of me winning by playing DIVERS was higher then the probability of we winning by playing VERDITES so i should have acted on that. Of course SKIVERED wins no matter what but yeah i dont know too many words sadly.
