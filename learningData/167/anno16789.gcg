#note Spent forever here. MUHLY-FEE doesn't really imply fishing to me, they're just plays that score a lot on this board. FEE indicates that he was probably a little vowel-heavy last turn. I don't really have an issue with opening the board here. Should I? 
TAV 11A isn't great, sets up DEVA which I don't have.
IV(Y) sets up my T but scores 9 and gets blocked quite often.  
Quackle's favorite play is (DE)V for 7.

#note Close call equity-wise between JOTAS/JATOS L1 and this, but I think this takes the cake since I'm down so much already and want to open more hooks and volaility.

#note Increasingly worried about the shape of this board. Trying to open the left side up. I should just play SAUTE/JIVES for 31 and see what happens. 
>Eric_Cahanin: ?INOPRS N9 PRISONs +87 275
#note If we want to play that game, he would have just bingoed with SAUTES/PRIsONS.

>Matt_Canik: ?AINOPT 6B OPuNTIA +70 194
#note Played up here because if I have any shot at winning this game, I need a lot of lines to be open. I should probably just throw in the towel and grab the extra points.

#note Sets up QAT, and if he plays on the N2 side I get QI or QAT often.

#note Eric averaged over 51 points per turn this game. 

BRAVI was a massive swinging point. I can't know he has a 98 point 3x3, but if I keep things tight this game might come out way differently.
