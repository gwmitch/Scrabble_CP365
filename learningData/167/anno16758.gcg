#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures Episode.... Whatever.    After the game, Scott said he left QI.  He wanted to set up his Q for a decent play at I7.  Or he can always dump the Q at F7.  
>Tasha: AEELMNV 9B VELAMEN +72 72
#note But I ruined his plans.  :(
>Scott_Garner: IIIII -IIIII +0 28
#note I don't know why I did it this way.  I know he threw the Q back in.

#note M8 COIN is a bit better.  I like COIN.  Blocks any bingos on row 13 and eliminaetes any set ups on row 14.

>Tasha: CEGILOS M9 GI. +17 242
#note Scott took a very long time last turn and the whole time I'm thinking, "Please don't block ECLOGISE.*"  I'm so glad he blocked it.  It saved me some humiliation.  I think I was confusing it with ECLOGITE.
>Scott_Garner: FNU N13 FUN +19 214
>Tasha: CELNORS N2 CLONERS +74 316
#note I was playing CORNELS at first then switched it to CLONERS half-way through.  I made the right play.  Afterwards, Scott said had I played CORNELS, he would have bingoed through the R.  I told him that's why I played CLONERS instead.  I figured it's harder to bingo through an O than an R.  I'm strategizing! :D

>Tasha: ADINTWZ M3 AW.D +28 344
#note YES!  I always mess racks like this up, but I think I'm learning.  For the longest time, I just wanted to play 15L ZIN.  It's my natural instinct to just want to play off tiles like the Z ASAP, but this time I just knew it was the wrong play.  Because, you know, I always make a play like ZIN with racks like this and it's always wrong.  But I couldn't even see anything else.  Right when I resigned myself to ZIN, I see AWED.  INTZ is much better than ADNTW.  And I can always play ZIN next turn.

#note Scott has really good board vision.   He's also doing well right now in New Orleans! Woohoo!
>Tasha: BGLPTW -  +0 366
#note I challenged.  I learned AERIED. This is when things start to get a little funny.

>Tasha: BGLPTW -BGLPT +0 366
#note I exchanged 6, but I forgot what my last tile was.  I didn't have any vowels.   Anways, I kept the W because I felt it will help me in endgame if I draw the last A.  Drawing AH will be even better.   I  considered playing B(AA)L, but exchanging is mandatory.  What tiles you decide to keep is solely dependent on whether or not you suck.
>Scott_Garner: EHIIIRT 6F THRI.E +15 338
#note Actual rack.  
>Tasha: ADIIRTW O3 AW +25 391
#note The only playable bingo I saw was DIPLONT and I didn't block it because I figure from Scott's last play that he doesn't have it.  He played off two vowels - including the case E - in a consonant-heavy pool.  His rack must suck.
>Scott_Garner: GIINP 12A ...PING +32 370
>Tasha: DIIORTT 5D TRIO +15 406
#note I took several minutes here trying to think of the best endgame.  I think I found a good sequence in 5D TRIO --->  L1 DIT.   TRIO leaves unblockable outs in two spots.  I figured that there can't be anything much better than what I found.
>Scott_Garner: BDIL 4I BID +10 380
>Tasha: DIT 14I D.. +10 416
#note See what had happened was I suddenly decided that TALA isn't a word.    I need to stop second guessing myself.  I also need to study the fours again.
