>Jim_Burlant: EEIKNOT 9E KOINE +25 25
#note While this creates a potential X bomb on row 10, this scores and balances the rack too well to not take the chance.  Quackle agrees - this is best.  9F KINE (the runner up) wins roughly 1/2% less often and sims 1 point down.  Just shy of 46% to win.
>Craig_Sjostrom: AY 10E AY +32 54
>Jim_Burlant: BEFORTU 11C FUB +34 59
#note Best.  For comparison's sake, 11C FOB - the runner up - wins 3% less often and sims 7 points down at not even 1000 iterations.  Given that the board position is the same between the two plays, that shows the relative value of keeping EORT instead of ERTU. 
>Craig_Sjostrom: IX 10B XI +30 84
>Jim_Burlant: AEELORT -OE +0 59
#note Tile drawing failure.  With no 8 available, I didn't like any of my options. 9A plays didn't appeal to me as I thought they gave too much back, but in retrospect that's deceptive:  in reality, he's probably not going to be able to overlap with anything meaningful at 8A, and without a power tile he probably won't get anything than an average play back down the A column - something I failed to consider at the time.   He's obviously close to something and I don't want to leave myself AEO and float an E for him to play through, which ruled out TRIFLE C8, and RIFLE C9 was risky because it gave him easy plays back.   (Not to mention all the easy back hooks TRIFLE or RIFLE gives him if he needs them to bingo).   Both Championship Player and the sim think this is a reasonable play, but not best.  Champ's choice is 9B ER, which doesn't look so appealing if we pretend he has an S.  Pick your poison. 
>Craig_Sjostrom: ALOOPTT -AL +0 84
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLRRT 9A GAR +21 80
#note If I'd seen INTEGRAL H8, that would have been my choice.  INTEGRAL needed to be the play, and the rest of the options suck.  This is the best of the sucky options, but it's still a crappy play.  INTEGRAL wins 45%; this wins 41 and sims 9 points down.
>Craig_Sjostrom: ?ADEPRT J3 DEPARTs +70 154
#note I3 TRAPESED scores 73.
>Jim_Burlant: ELLORTY 3J .OLLY +18 98
#note His bingo killed me, as he blocked both placements of my bingo. Looking at the options,  I didn't know any of the 6's I needed to know to make the best play here:  TROLLY 8J is best.  TROLLY wins 21-1/2%; this wins 20.2 and sims roughly 4 points down.
>Craig_Sjostrom: GUV A6 VUG. +27 181
>Jim_Burlant: EGLRSTT 12A GLET +25 123
#note Phony.  With no open I or U to play through, what else was I going to do with this crap?  My best legitimate plays are either C8 GRIFT or GRIFTER and those barely win 17%.  This wins over 20 and sims 7 points better than any of those.
>Craig_Sjostrom: FIT A12 .IFT +24 205
>Jim_Burlant: DLRRSTT -DLRT +0 123
#note I'm in serious trouble here - 12% to win.  Quackle agrees - this is best.  Q thinks TROD K1 is also worthwhile - huge deficit or not, that just looks like it will throw gasoline on the fire. I'd make this play again.
>Craig_Sjostrom: AC 6A .AC +10 215
>Jim_Burlant: EIJORST L1 JO.T +38 161
#note Wondered how much of the rack to turn but felt the EIRS leave and 38 points made this the best play.  Q aqrees - 19% to win.
>Craig_Sjostrom: CEENORS 13D ENCORES +64 279
#note Fortunately for me, he doesn't find NECROSE D1 for 79.  He's still 95% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEIRS 12I DEARIES +73 234
#note Best bingo, but still only 13% to win.
>Craig_Sjostrom: EHS 5J .ESH +30 309
>Jim_Burlant: AADINRT O5 RADIANT. +77 311
#note Asleep at the switch.  I was simply so glad he didn't take the O column out that I didn't notice the phony PESH* until afterwards.  Anyway - this is my only bingo and it wins roughly 35% in a short sim; that win percentage is probably depressed because the blank is still at large.
>Craig_Sjostrom: EINNO 1J EN.OIN +39 348
>Jim_Burlant: ?AABEOS N6 BOA +26 337
#note Amazing what landing the case blank does for your winning percentages.  The only 7 in this rack is AMOEBAS, which doesn't play.  I thought I might have missed something through the R (there are no bingos here)...but decided that, with the D column and row 15 being possibilities, scoring 26, defending against the Z and drawing 3 to AES? was a good play.  Q agrees - this is best.  I'm almost 70% to win.

#note Best bingo.

>Jim_Burlant:  (TU) +4 471
#note Craig went roughly 1:30 over on time.  Final score 471 - 401.  Played well in spots, played iffy in others.  The first exchange wasn't necessary, though admittedly it was not an awful play.  GAR was a board vision failure, and I didn't know enough words to make the right play when my bingo was blocked.  And I needed to pay attention when he put down PESH*.   But I still managed to right the ship and pull it out.  Safe to say that against any of the usual suspects I play against, this would have been a sure loss.
