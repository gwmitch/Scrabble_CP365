#note Tough one. No real standout play. I am maybe too worried about leaving this spot open. A lot of the time, he hasn't got much. Might be worth the risk to take more equity with 3G NAP or 5E FAGIN. But they all sim pretty tight. Like I said, tough one.

#note Seemed the leave was more workable that with ENEMY. Definitely close, though.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEINNNO D1 BOIN. +22 171
#note Again no standouts. Other options are B(R)IN and BE(G)IN. Felt like keeping the best possible leave was important here, since Adam is turning over lots of tiles into unseen blanks.

#note Surprisingly favorable sim results for H1 ANOMY, which I did not even seriously consider. Scoring 41 and opening a bingo lane seemed automatic. But ANOMY blocks row 1 somewhat and keeps the X for a very likely play next turn. A lot of the time, that play is C3 XI, which also opens a lane, or just something parallel to CONFERS. I think AXE is fine here, but ANOMY is a neat alternative.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADELNNO 1D .LONDE +27 239
#note Now I definitely want to do ANOMY. The fact that I wasn't seeing it did not help. Significant miss.......

#note I've let myself get fairly low on time with the trickier racks from earlier. Now I have this annoying rack and not a lot of time to figure it out. I dunno. My play sucks. But I kind of hate all of Quackle's top plays. I need to bingo, and Adam is likely to block lanes next turn, if he can. The existing lanes are not reliable. I wanted to open a new one. What I should have done was C3 MU, which achieves what I needed in a far less panicky fashion. Two goofs in a row and suddenly this is looking super grim.
>Adam_Logan: AGY A1 GA.Y +42 365
#note Oof. Yup, MAVIN sucked.

#note Wasn't expecting to have both bingos blocked. :-( I need to open a bingo line here, but I missing an opportunity to make a real strong one: B3 AALII. Basically, I need to draw the Q and bingo with it. Or leave it in the bag and catch him with it.
