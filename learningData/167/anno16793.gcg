#note I was about 40% sure this was a word, but against Joey I don't think he has the stones to challenge it. GAPEY*
>Joey_Krafchick: ACDEHRS K2 SEARCH.D +78 78
>Matt_Canik: AILOOTU 6J O.ULI +11 41
#note U(P)O is probably better. I wasn't realy interested in keping 5 mediocre 1-pointers together, but I think I need to. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EOWW 9G WOWE. +36 114

>Joey_Krafchick: AUUV M3 UVU.A +18 132
>Matt_Canik: ?AABFIO J2 OBA +17 95
#note I like forcing a race to this hook with a deficit on a shit board. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EORSU 1F ROUES +21 153
>Matt_Canik: ??AAEFI 11E FIE +20 115
#note FAscIAE is a bing that scores 74 here. Sim prefers passing itand playing FIE, but I didn't even see it. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AFIT 12C FIAT +22 175
#note As Joey draws after this play, he knocks a tile onto the table from his rack. It's a J.

>Joey_Krafchick: EITX 3C EXIT +40 306
>Matt_Canik: HLMORTZ 1B MOR +24 319
#note Saw EXTOL but not EXHORT. OH holds 5 cononants drawing into a consonant-heavy pool. I need to get rid of this spot. Somehow I missed MOL though. 
>Joey_Krafchick: EGK B6 KEG +21 327
#note He sets this down, looks at his rack unhappily for a while, counts the remaining tiles, and then plays it. 

I conclude from this that he's holding 4 consonants with this play. Is that reasonable? 
>Matt_Canik: GHLMNTZ N5 N.GHT +14 333
#note NTH N1 is a cool play because I draw ZING a lot, but Joey blocks that most of the time. NIGHT sets up HM and good plays. I'm concluding that joey held four consonants and this will make his life really difficult. NIGHTY is a worry but it's not too likely and my M play still scores more than his NIGHTY play will. I loved this play.

#note Good game. I've got the case E. It's going to take a shitty Q stick and some help for joey to win this game. 
>Joey_Krafchick: AQT 11K QAT +28 390
>Matt_Canik: EIILLMN O8 MI +35 404
#note The game is over here. Choose to cash the M now and the E later.
