#note This is a big miss. MOIRE 12H is best by a good bit, but I already missed that spot with AIRY. At the very least, why didn't I play R(E)MOTE?

#note GILLED blocked VIOLATER, and there's nothing in this rack that fits under KI. If I had played off the I someplace else, I would have had AVOdIRE 13F for the win. Playing the I elsewhere is about 17% win, so my intuition was right that KI would be easier to hook on, but wrong by this distribution of luck. I went over several minutes trying to make sure I wasn't missing a bingo.
