#note I didn't like OI at E11 because it partially blocked the A and there weren't many consonants to bingo through. after a play on row 7 by him next turn it seemed quite hard to bingo. on the other hand, OI may keep the board open by encouraging him to play at D12. Q says playing OI is 4 points better, but I think exchanging again is fine.

#note close between jeez, gizmo, maize and jive. I thought his last play suggested he was quite likely to have an A, so I decided against gizmo. his fish last turn suggests he is more likely to bingo, so it seemed more possible that he wouldn't hit the J immediately. the most important thing with this kind of rack is to plan a way out of it, but in this case I didn't have much in mind besides taking the points and figuring the Z would be easier to play than the J.

#note unmew is a few better, I thought GMNW had a better chance of working out than FGZ, because I will likely need to bingo asap, but the Z can pick up cheap points with fuzed/fuzee or feaze or something.

#note I again have a bingo (SAPOGENIN, which I didn't know) but this is definitely the best play, setting up a difficult lane to block unless he plays at 15A

#note all of a sudden, I realized that he had no vowels, and that I could fish for the 3x3. setting up XI here is not relevant, he can always play a blocking play at 8M, just distraction.
>Joey_Mallick: BCDLPTW H1 BL.W +39 530
#note unbelievably, joey saw that I had a 3x3 but had the score wrong (me with 10 points less) and therefore DIDN'T BLOCK because he was going to win anyway.

#note with 15 seconds on my clock I found the only winning play, but circled THE WRONG LETTER (an S) on the designation sheet...and only realized it a minute after the end of the game!
