#note felt like there was a bingo in this rack.  A(D)ROITER is the only bingo which is what I was looking for.  Spent at least 2 min on this rack.  Fora isn't even on the list.  Q likes my leave though.  
>Judy: AELOZ 8K ZOEAL +56 72
#note AZOLE is better for 22 more pts.  I've seen two big azole misses this tourney.  Somewhat concerned about Judy's quick start.
