#note I shold really not hold on to IIIU- Wait I can score 31? Okay I guess I'll hold on to IIIU. 

Quackle's valuation of IIINU is -28 points. Lol.

#note I'm assuming he held AEINRT after his last play. I can't *know* he did but given all the context that seems quite likely. I went through and figured out if it was more likely that he draws a bingo at the bottom-left or top-right. I concluded top-right and blocked it. But this was certainly a misplay- I didn't notice RETINAE fit at N2 yet and should have done something to knock out L and N at the same time. I have to hope he didn't draw RETIRANT or RETAINER
>Jason_Broersma: AEINRTU G7 U. +3 376
#note Still extremely likely he's holding AEINRT in my head. 
>Matt_Canik: CIOPTTW G10 TOP.C +9 420
#note I want to empty the bag here to avoid giving him another chance to fish for RETINAE/RETAINER. He'll likely open a new line for himself by making a play at I13 or something so I can't take out one line now and one later. If he picked up an E on his draw (20% chance to me) then I lose probably lose, although if I draw an O he's left with CFG and maybe I can eke out an endgame with W(EF)T affording me a lot of points.
