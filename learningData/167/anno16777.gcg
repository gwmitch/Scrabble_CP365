#note The reason she wins this game is because she opened vertically. 
>Matt_Canik: EEGILMO G5 EGO +11 11
#note I got destroyed by this turn. I had no idea what to do and I ended up getting way to fixated on breaking up the GOM combo. Sim prefers EM for 19. I think everything available here sucks. -6

#note Down 130 already, I don't really want to give up another turn and fall behind anymore. Maybe I can get lucky with my pull here and work through. Quackle doesn't think so, but it's quite close. -1(?) 

What's the consensus on exchanging when you're down? Is it something to do more or less?

I hold AEN here....

#note ...and pull UUVY! While she bingos again!

>Matt_Canik: CEIIINR L8 ICIER +19 99
#note This is me throwing in the towel. If I were really trying to win I'd probably play RICIN in hopes of making M a decent bingo column.

#note Yes! 100 points!
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ANNWY 15J .WANNY +39 380
#note SWANNY is a random 6 that doesn't have any other forms. I don't feel bad about challenging this.

>Matt_Canik: BDDHNTU O11 BUDD. +13 195
#note Thought about playing TH(EME) to bail me out of draws into the Q. Decided against it.

>Terry_Kang_Rau: EIRV 2D VIE +14 477
#note So the 1 power tile I drew this game ended up being the Q that I drew twice and ended up getting stuck with. 

Did I play poorly? Absolutely. But yeesh, this was probably the most miserable game I've played in years.
