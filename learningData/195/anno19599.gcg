#note Missed OUTGUN, which opens up a lot of space and keeps a good leave.  This play is good defensively though, and I expect to slowly catch up.  TONGUE might be better at creating space though.

#note Sim likes K(EN)!  Aggressive, but looks really good.  I was too focused on blocking the x2x2 threat.
>Matt_L: CGIRU K5 GU.... +14 143
>E_Tran: AEFLMST 6J F.MET +34 244
#note Aggressive, but he's only had 5 tiles of turn over in the last two turns.  The safer play is J3 FLAMEN, which I didn't spot.
>Matt_L: CIPRR M2 PRIC.R +22 165
>E_Tran: ?AALOOS O6 SOLA +23 267
#note Ick.  He's just gotten some decent turnover, so I this I have to make this scared blocking play.  Against lower rated players, I always try to restrict their easy scoring plays.

#note I've got about 8 minutes of clock; Matt has 2 or 3.  My biggest strategic decision is deciding how long to shuffle and waste time before laying this down (the longer I take to play this, the more likely it will draw a challenge).  I ended up only dawdling for about 3 minutes, and it did not draw a challenge

#note I see SYENITE SIENITE and STIBINE as possble bingos.  Blocking those has to be the best valauation play I figure, though champ likes 15M JOG.
