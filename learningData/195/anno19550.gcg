>Norman_Wei: AJY 8G JAY +26 26
#note so far i played against Norman twl only. Finally i pushed him to try CSW. since 3rd move, racks are actual. lets see what happened

>Michal_Josko: AIIMNOS 7I MOI +18 18
#note i think it was my first rack.
MOI# is not bad. i didnt remember MOAI#.  if i would, i think i would play it. 
quackle suggests better OI AI IO, AMI but i dont wannna# keep m or o
>Norman_Wei: DSU J5 DU.S +21 47
#note with this given tiles, UDOS 2 points more. JUD# would save S
>Michal_Josko: AINNSST K4 NIS. +16 34
#note because i had problems with laptop , i had to wait till next for this move. when i turn on scrabble, i noticed possible 8 that wouldnt see day before- INSANEST. no E on the board unfortunately.
NISI according to quackle slightly worse than SAN# NAS# AN
>Norman_Wei: AA -AA +0 47

>Michal_Josko: ADHLNST 9F DAH +23 57
#note knew dahl not dhal. DAH most points tho
>Norman_Wei: ADILNSU 10H SUNDIAL +68 115
#note I is blank. several bingos there

>Michal_Josko: ELNSTUV L3 LUV +23 80

LUV no.2

#note NO.1
>Norman_Wei: AEINOOT A12 .ONE +39 187
#note aah, norman messed order of his racks that he sent me. i think this is the right one.
ENTOZOA new for me. i personally like ZOOT# which takes only Y
>Michal_Josko: ENRRSTV M9 R.V +7 165
#note could do VAR which was no.1 but wanted to show of with RAV#, which isnt bad either. if i would go for points,VERST VERTS REVS  VENTS VERS# in row O are the options.

>Norman_Wei: BEILMTW 12K BLEW +25 212
#note ibetwlm
quackles choice no.4- WIMBLE, WEMB# WITE are higher

>Norman_Wei: DEIIMOT 13L IDEM +39 251

#note appologies to Norman. he send me raqcks in correct order, i just screwed order of RAV# and ZOOEA#. hope everything at the end will look ok.
>Norman_Wei: AEIRRTW M2 WATER +31 282
#note considered myself this spot with all possible DIV# hooks - ae,i#,o#,s#
>Michal_Josko: ACEITTX N1 TEC +25 301
#note in my mind: 
1)xi,wex#/mi/ - quackle choice no.1
2)tex#/we/lax - quackle choice  no.2 
3)tec/we/lac- quackle dont like it much,  but i tried to spot later in row o AX EX or OX.

another cool move that i didnt see was defect/zooeae# 
>Norman_Wei: BEEGIIN O1 EE +18 300
#note that didnt work for me
>Michal_Josko: AEIOTTX 14N XI +48 349

#note punch no.1 in a face - possible triple with WEXE# blocked
>Michal_Josko: AAEIIQT 15M TE. +19 393
#note punch no 2- q from bag. i dont see Normans tiles but praying he will open row d. most points for TEC#, quackle still hates it

reminder : I in sundial is blank, so i had to extend bag in quackle. blank is not available
>Norman_Wei: AGKLRUY G13 K.. +12 406
#note 1st and 2nd quackles suggestions: YUKO#,KAYO would be dreams for me since i would be able to get rid of the q. its not always good idea to listen to the duck
