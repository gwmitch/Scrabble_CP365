#note Hahaha.  Major rack vision error.

>Sean_Wrona: ?AOSUVW 6J VAW +41 102
#note I have no idea why I played VAW instead of VOW.  Because I was thinking of OUT bingos maybe?  OU probably do go together better than AU and this does sim better so even though I think this was a counterintuitive thing to do now, it was probably right.

#note The board vision meeting is adjourned.  Major error.  I'm not sure I even looked for bingos once I saw this.  SOJA might be worth doing over bingoing, but I didn't see that either.

#note I didn't see/consider YANG here, but one thing I must say is that even though my greatest weakness is not bothering to look for plays in spots I consider dangerous, I *usually* have good instinct at finding some safer play elsewhere.  I still think I'd play YANG if I saw it.
