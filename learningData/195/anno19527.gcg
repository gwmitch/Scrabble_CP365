#note MT: Jesse won't let me get a bingo down if I don't open up immediately. This seems necessary

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEIIORT K3 .OA +24 184
#note MT: So many I's unseen. I was just hoping to get lucky. O1 OI might be better since it bingos so much more often. I figured that fell too far behind. It's close
>Jesse_Day: AEHMNTU 4D HUMANE +29 250
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIINRST 5D IT +13 197
#note MT: Spent a while here. I considered opening up the bottom row with 14G ID or something similar. But a lot of the time, Jesse responds at D12, blocking the lane (although sometimes opening a new one, but then I'm too far behind. I figured the extra points for my play was going to be important. And that it wasn't that easy to block. Also considered INHUMANE, but I dunno, I'd rather fish to sevens.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEIIMRW B10 WEIR +32 292
#note MT: I missed a great opportunity in B8 MEW, setting up my case A. It's interesting, but I think WEIR is the play. It sets up some crazy stuff, but a lot of that stuff was already scary with the B10 hot spot.
>Jesse_Day: ?OQTTUY 14J QUOT. +34 325
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AIIIMNP 15J IMPI +35 327
#note MT: Nope. Didn't solve it in time. This always loses to TEXT or something. I need to play A12 PAIN and draw the blank, threatening IMpI as my out. Lost 1/8 of a win here.
