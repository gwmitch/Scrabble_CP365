#note Yikes.  I actually thought this was good for some reason even though it was WELL within my probability range.  Unfortunately, alcades/geladas weren't (even though I vaguely knew both of those were words, I didn't think of them).  Major error even though I got away with it (did I only get away with it because she had UPWAFTED and wouldn't have been able to bingo otherwise?)  I still think I'd probably challenge here if I knew it was bad and just play UPWAFT since I'm still a tempo ahead even after UPWAFTED probably...  But wow, this is embarrassing.

#note I actually *forgot* this was good and was just guessing it must be.  When something is so easy to anagram based on its alphagram it doesn't remain very memorable, but after this, JERRY and his cousin JENNY have remained at the forefront of the mind.  Can't forget words like that no matter how easy they are to anagram.  That horrified me after the game, but at least I was right that it's valid.  Sheesh.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: ABEINTU G2 UNITAB.E +65 226
>Cynthia_Pughsley: ABEINTU --  -65 161
#note I don't even remember where she attempted to play UNITABLE.  After Benjy Boy got away with that against me at Poughkeepsie, I certainly have not forgotten that, so I was almost gleeful when she played this because I could challenge with certainty.  That also meant I didn't write down her placement or score so I don't know what her exact rack was.  I *think* she played it through the L though.
>Sean_Wrona: AEGISTZ G7 G.AZIEST +72 222
#note Try harder.  This play provides horrible scoring defense for plays at H12 so obviously two of the three AGATIZES are better, but this must be better than AGATIZES F8.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: ABEINTU J8 .UB +23 184
#note Oh, if her rack actually was this, it makes GLAZIEST *way* worse than AGATIZES which I somehow missed/ignored because it gives her INTUBATE.  However, I don't know what letter she tried to play UNITABLE through (it could have been the A or something), so I don't *know* that this was her rack.

>Sean_Wrona: AAIIOTU M1 TAO +22 335
#note The defense makes this fairly acceptable but the horrific leave is obviously why it's really not.  I still need to play UTOPIA, which I didn't see.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: AEIOT 10F A.O +14 213
>Sean_Wrona: AFHIIIU -FIIIU +0 335
#note Okay, notl ooking for plays here is pretty bad although I think few could fault me for making an exchange anyway, since even after HAIR, I leave FIIU.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: EILT 15N EL +11 224
>Sean_Wrona: AEHIOWY 15H WHO +36 371
#note Major error.  I missed a lot of great crosswords that scored more and gave me much better leaves.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: IPT 2L ..P +14 238
>Sean_Wrona: ACEIILY L12 YA.E +32 403
#note Well, now I finally find something there, too little too late.  But AIRY is obviously better, yet I somehow missed that.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: AEINRRT 12A RETAIN.R +70 308
>Sean_Wrona: CFIIILN 13B FIN +23 426
#note Missed INFLICT.  Major board vision error.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: EN 7E EN. +6 314
#note What is this fishing for since it takes no front hooks?
>Sean_Wrona: CIIL B10 CL.. +15 441
#note Whatever it is, I'd better take care of the threat.  And I failed to record what tiles I drew here.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: Q E11 Q. +22 336
>Sean_Wrona: DIINORX N9 OXID +29 470
#note Whoa, INTI is freaking cool.  I would not have considered UNDENIABLE.  And that is indeed undeniable.  Not an error though.  This play is hardly worse.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: EU J4 E.U +7 343
>Sean_Wrona: EGGIINR 10B .IG +6 476
#note I'm not really sure why I'm fishing when the board is pretty much shut down.  It wasn't a horrible thing to do though.
>Cynthia_Pughsley: CKOOO 1G COOKO.. +39 382
#note She told me she was fishing for this for a while so maybe that's what ENG and EMU were about, and I have had moments when I've been uninspired and fished for things like that which weren't mathematically worth it, so since she wasn't going to win the game anyway, I can see why a cool extension might redeem it for her.  She probably actually enjoyed herself anyway, which gives her a leg up over me, since I never seem to be able to enjoy anything.
>Sean_Wrona: EGIMNRR E3 GENR. +12 488
#note I think I saw that she had VIED and must have wanted to block it but couldn't find a good way to do it, so instead I played something stupid and didn't even dump the M.  This is bordering on a major error.  I should have been able to hold her to under 400 (and when I was freaking out about how I gave up 400 points in 9/12 games by about this point, this could have helped my mental health in future games) but I blew it.

Major errors (3): ALIASED (phony when I had real bingos), WHO (board vision), FIN (board vision)
