#note Major strategy error.  What was I trying to do?  Create a very weak hotspot for OXO on row 10?  That has considerably less value than just playing OX now and saving a decent leave.

#note Major play-finding error.  I was obviously preoccupied with dumping two Ns that I missed the better row 5 spot to do it and blew up a potentially good leave, not to mention giving him an easier bingo spot.

#note Major error.  FANG is actually likely much better defense as well as having a superior score and leave (although I would still have to worry aobut ING bingos after FANG, so I guess the main difference is the leave.  However, there are still a lot of column M bingos he could conceivably have while I could have shut that down with FANG.)

#note I'm actually supposed to fish here?  I guess I can see that since there are only 2 tiles left and they're pretty good, but I'm still not going to call this an error.  Learned some useful words I shockingly didn't know like every other bingo I had with this rack.
