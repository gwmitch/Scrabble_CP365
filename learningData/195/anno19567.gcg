>Brian_Galebach: FIR H7 FIR +12 12
#note *Yawn*

The final day! Can I go 3-0 and stay positive?
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGOTUW 9G G.OW +11 11
#note I didn't like the risk associated with OUTG(R)EW but I think I have to play it anyway. I also considered 10D TOGUE but I really really really wanted to see what Brian could accomplish on a closed board. 
>Brian_Galebach: IJLST K5 JILTS +33 45
#note hopefully this meant we would be able to see, but I had other plans
>Joshua_Sokol: CDEENTU 8K .UNED +21 32
#note I could have kept things closed. I should have kept things closed. I5 CUE or G5 CUE are just so much better...
>Brian_Galebach: EH J6 HE +28 73
>Joshua_Sokol: AACEIRT M4 CARI.ATE +62 94
#note Aha, ACIERAT(E) is 12 more. Probably worth it. 0/3?
>Brian_Galebach: ABDELPU G1 DUPABLE +72 145
#note yes, 0/3
>Joshua_Sokol: BGIMOPU 1E PO.IUM +33 127
>Brian_Galebach: EINRSTV 11H REINV.ST +72 217
#note ok Brian, that's enough
>Joshua_Sokol: BFGHORU O11 .HROB +42 169
>Brian_Galebach: AEIRTW 13I WARTIE. +28 245
#note I think he struggled between this and playing AW somewhere. Don't worry, he obviously made the right play
>Joshua_Sokol: AADFGMV 2F F.D +31 200
#note Maybe 2B FAVA. I'll stop going into detail though

#note Instachallenged. I knew COOLIE was a word so I didn't think COOLY was and even if it was I had to challenge?
>Brian_Galebach: ??IOSSY C6 .lOSSIlY +72 530
#note Wow! He has so many awesome options! Did any of you know LYCOPODIUM? Other bingo is GOSSIPRY. That's probably more likely to be a word than GLOSSILY but Brian probably knew both.

#note At some point during this game I just got up from my seat and took a small walk. I was really really agitated.
