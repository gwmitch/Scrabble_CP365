#note Note to self: Be afraid.  Be very, very afraid.  You lost a game to Heather McCall in much the same way.  Not that there's anythingh wrong with this play per se, but I can't fish endlessly and let her back into the game by scoring higher plays.

#note Oops...it appears I just did that.
>Sean_Wrona: AAEINOS B1 .O.A +14 334
#note Major strategic error.  Too bad a leave for how little I'm scoring.  I guess I agree with the sim that NAOI is better than this because it scores and better than AGIO (which would normally be fine holding the last S) because she could hit XI/OX or something easily and make it very hard on me.  Really, I need to score at this point and not fish for bingos she's likely to block.  I end up doing this sometimes when there really aren't great scoring options.
>Ruchi_Gupta: EGILT J3 LEGIT +23 331
>Sean_Wrona: AEEINSU 5C E.E +14 348
#note This was a very hard position.  The tournament is so long ago I can't remember my thought processes but I wanted to make sure I had two spots for an outplay and I wasn't able to do it.  I did eventually calculate that her best-scoring play wouldn't outscore UNAIS, but I had her best-scoring play as EXED, not EXITED, so this very easily could have been a loss.  I'm glad it wasn't.  It is a 100% win over EKE.  At least I had the sense to make sure I had one outspot.  The star play is ENSUE/ELEGIT.  Wow, that's slick, I know ELEGIT is a word and it leaves two outplays.  That play is beautiful.  I was actually concerned she was going to play FAX after this block UNAIS and somehow outscore me, but I guess that's not possible.

I spent 10 minutes on this play with 4 minutes remaining.  Did I spend enough?  Well, it's unlikely I'd have thought of the LEGIT-->ELEGIT hook in another 4 minutes.
