#note MT: Aw, should have kept looking. CHARRY is the star play. Tsk.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AACNTXZ N1 ZAX +47 271
#note MT: I like it even better after WE, since maybe he has to bingo and leave the spot open for me. It's still a weird looking play to me, though.
>Jesse_Day: ADEEITT 1L DA.E +48 250
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACENOTY H1 NOTA.Y +35 306
#note MT: COYER and COSEY are the other choices. If I think it's possible to stop him from bingoing, COSEY might be the play. But the board is so bingo-friendly it might just be better to keep it open so my bingo chances remain high too. COYER is a couple points up on this and COSEY is one pt up. Shrug.

#note MT: Didn't see CONFUTE, which looks decent as well.

#note MT: I lose to JUDO, but if he has that, I probably lose to JO anyways. So blocking JO and keeping FLAM for 30. Saw HOOVED and HOOVER as the only threats through the V, but I just hoped he wouldnt have them. Or JUDO obviously

#note MT: Uhh... I think I missed VEX and was paranoid about being V stuck or something.
