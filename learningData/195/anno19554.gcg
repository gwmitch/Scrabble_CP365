#note Sam forgot HOWK.  So admittedly did I saw this position.  That's another one of those words that is so easy to anagram it doesn't remain memorable.

#note I have no idea why I chose VIES over VISE.  I'm thinking it's because I held the blank and this would make it easier for me to bingo next turn.  It might be right.  It does sim better.

#note The problem is this essentially forces all my bingos to end in N (or admittedly ERS, but obviously if he has an E, which is almost certain, he will block with a UTE play as he did).  Still not going to call it a major error.  I mean I could easily bingo off his next play after this as well.  Yeah, AUTO/AUXIN are probably better since they create a second spot.  I needed to think more counterintuitively probably.

#note I described this play after the game as "Sam choking and me trying to choke it back to him", prompting Brian Bowman to tell me in my hotel room that I need to stop being so hard on myself.  At least about this.  I have plenty of other good reasons to be hard on myself.  I misunderstood the real threat during the game.  His play of UH much earlier indicates that the major threat is -ED bingos especially with 4 Es and 2 Ds left in the very small pool.  RENAILS/NAILERS gives him an easy spot for -ED bingos making them essentially unblockable.  I *have* to play ALINERS here but screwed up because I didn't want to put a vowel next to the TLS, which was totally irrelevant since nothing there scores higher than a G.  I need to play ALINERS, hopefully draw a D, and block the DUH spot.  I just got lucky here.  I consider this a major error, no matter how it sims.  (And it actually won the sim, but I usually only do 500 iterations at 4-ply and that's probably not nearly enough.)  I don't care.  ALINERS is the only play worth doing and I see that now.

#note So I just lucked out and he didn't draw a bingo.  This is still a mistake since I'm giving him an easy hook with END and I know he has the last D.  I'll be less harsh on myself and not call it major.  RENAILS was the major error.
