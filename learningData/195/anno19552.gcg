#note Not sure why KUFI is appearing to be much better than this.  I didn't see it, but I don't see how the ELIO leave is all that good on this board.  I'd rather keep a K after this play with the KHI/ELK possibilities.
>Mad_Palazzo: ?INOSTV L3 NOVIsTS +75 93
>Mad_Palazzo: ?INOSTV --  -75 18
#note Wow, and she could have played those exact letters in the exact same order to form a 9.
>Sean_Wrona: ?IKLOOY 7I KOI +27 40
#note So I inadvertently blocked all her bingos with this but despite knowing what her entire rack I didn't look for what bingos she had.  Does that make this a success or a failure?

#note Missed EUPNEIC.  Oh well.  This can't be much worse since it would likely make it much harder for her to bingo.
>Mad_Palazzo: ?AERSST E3 ScAR.EST +64 110
>Sean_Wrona: ADEGIJR 3B JAG. +24 172
#note Missed JERID, and I must have played JAGS instead of JIGS because there are so many more As than Is remaining, but I still think it's wrong.
>Mad_Palazzo: FZ K11 F.Z +40 150
>Sean_Wrona: DEIRSTU 4E .URDIEST +70 242
#note I guessed she would be likeliest to challenge this of the three bingos.
>Mad_Palazzo: ADEN -  +0 150
#note I was right.

#note This is the first game where I would say I made no major errors.  It felt like my best game of the tournament while I was playing it, and I'm glad that the sims backed that up.  For somebody as awful at board vision as I am to find something like TWINE/LITU, I figured I was doing well.  Although EPICURE instead of EUPNEIC did end up being a bit of a spread-killer due to FEZ/SANG.
