>Harriet: EFHIOPR 8D FOREHIP +88 88
>Harriet: EFHIOPR --  -88 0
#note Tom said this one was worth a try. I agree but unfortunately for Tom, I know a lot of FORE- words. He would get this to stick on somebody at club though.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEEGPR 8D CREEP +24 24
#note It was either allow the 36 point benjamin H8 (CREEP)IER or allow G7 FOH for 30 points. I'm not sure I made the right call with D8 CREEP instead of H8 CREEP as G7 FOH leaves better rack balance for Tom then H8 (CREEP)IER would.
>Harriet: EFHIOPR 7G FOH +30 30
#note Tom made top play here according to Quackle.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGMNORU 9G MEG +27 51
#note Double double E5 MOURNER for 36 points simmed much better than G9 MEG that I played. Note to self: watch for those double doubles.
>Harriet: CEEIPRT 6H RECEIPT +80 110
#note Another top play by Tom. Maybe allowing FOH was a bad idea. This was the only bingo he had. I held briefly to check IE vs. EI spellings.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?LNOORU D6 UN.OOLeR +68 119
#note I saw the correct line but played the phony UNCOOLER* instead of the valid UNICOLOR. I knew UNICOLOR too. No sevens in this rack and only two 8's. HOURLONG was the other eight and it was not playable. Tom didn't even hold this. He frequently likes to challenge my words.
>Harriet: ARR K5 R.AR +8 118
>Jonathan_Lindh: DOWY 8K .OWDY +39 158
#note I don't remember my rack here.
>Harriet: BGLO 5E BLOG +22 140
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?BEGMOT 11C G.OB +14 172
#note Missed bingo alert! I missed B13 BE(R)GAMOT for 82 points. I was somewhat familiar with it too. My play sims 8th best and creates a lane for bingos starting in a vowel or Y. Note GLOB is much better than it's anagram BLOG because there are more hooks onto a B than a G. BE(R)GAMOT is much better though than GLOB and this was a screwup. I'm sure BERGAMOT was not in Tom's range and would have been (unsuccessfully) challenged.
>Harriet: ADEINRS C1 SARDINE +73 213
#note Bleh, ARSINE bingo. Only playable in that spot. B13 SERRANID is 74 points vs. 73 points for SARDINE and SERRANID is 1st choice. I say its coin flip due to potential comeback play on the triple word score in the H column. Did you know SERRANOID is a valid common 9 that does not take an S?
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEEFMT B2 FEE +27 199
#note I think this was a brilliant play on my end. I cleared out my excess E's scored 27 points and created a 7 lane for myself while holding ?EMT for the leave. Quackle likes FEET B2 for 31 points better but I think mine is better because it keeps bingo lanes open while I have the blank.
>Harriet: ADILT A4 TIDAL +26 239
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEIMNT 1C .EdIMENT +80 279
#note Bingo! My setup worked as intended! Keep the lanes open with the blank and balance your rack. Quackle likes N8 DEMENTIA for 82 points better and rates SEDIMENT as the 2nd best play. I'm starting to think Quackle is suffering from DEMENTIA, as (D)EMENTIa leaves a great comeback oppurtunity on the triple. My play puts me up by 40 points with all of the blanks out and no good comeback oppurtunities.
>Harriet: EHIIST M8 .HITIES +34 273
#note That's racist! Also note the T hook to make WHITIEST that I did not see. GRR!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AJNNOWZ 10L W.Z +35 314
#note Got the second best play again. Quackle likes J9 AZON for 40 points, gaining 5 more points and closing down the board more. 
>Harriet: AINOVVY 11K IO.A +24 297
#note AZON would have prevented that.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AJNNOTU 12J ANT. +22 336
>Harriet: ADESU O11 SAUDE +26 323
#note Yes this is phony. I thought about holding but Tom snuck that by so fast I didn't think it was worth challenging for 26 points. Learn more 4-6 letter words!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAIJNOU 9C J. +17 353
>Harriet: IQ 13I QI +23 346
#note There's the Q!
>Jonathan_Lindh: NNO 10B NO.N +19 372
#note This was a good find. I don't know if it was the best play as I stopped writing down my racks at this point, but 19 points with the letters I had was very good.
>Harriet: AKSUVXY 13B VA.Y +20 366
>Jonathan_Lindh: ILSTUVX G11 SIX +26 398
#note This is where knowing and remembering WHITIEST would have come in handy. K15 IXTLE for 34 points. Quackle's simulation does leave open the possibility of a V stick if I9 GUV gets taken. Quackle's O4 XIS is terrible because Tom has 2 A's so he could play KA/AXIS for 17 points. I'll stick with my play.
>Harriet: AAKU E3 KA. +9 375
>Jonathan_Lindh: LTUV 14J LUV. +14 412
#note Found the best play! Saw 3rd place I9 (G)UV and looked for a better play. This is much better. I think I played a well played endgame.
>Harriet: AU B13 .AU +12 387
>Harriet:  (T) +2 389
#note BERGAMOT. I'm going to remember that one. And I still think Quackle may be developing DEMENTIA.
