#note Missed ZANY, but they are pretty close.

>Sykes: CEENPVY 6F PEC +27 238
#note VEEP keeps CNY.  CNY is not a horribly leave.  I was too paranoid about closing the board, but it's open enough I need to take the equity here.
>E_Tran: GMOO 13G G.OOM +10 170
>Sykes: EEMNSVY 12K ENVY +24 262
#note Again, making a 7 pt sacrifice and not making ENVY/GLOOMY.  The remaining bingo lines are all terrible.  This is a proper time to sacrifice pts for board shape I believe.. so maybe PEC, too, wasn't too terrible

>Sykes: ILOQTTU M3 QUOT. +28 329
#note QUOIT(S) is the standard equity play.  I thought the board would be uglier after this play.  But, looking at all those i's int he pool, I've got to do QUOIT(S)
>E_Tran: IL N2 LI +16 302
>Sykes: CFIIILT 11J IF +26 355
#note I couldn't find the sweet play of CLITIC.  This continues to muck up the board though.

>Sykes: CHIIILT 2E LIT.IC +19 374
#note C2 LITHIA is the best way to block all the lines.  I didn't spot it.
