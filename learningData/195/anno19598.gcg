#note Given the current board shape, my play here should be less about equity and more about finding ways to blow the board open.  12F DOBRA might be a good choice.
>Emil_R: AA 6I AA +10 51
>E_Tran: BCDEOOR 5I BOO +18 74
#note This board shape is pretty bad for me.  5G DOBRO would be better.  5J COB is better for defense.

#note I liked how this opens an S hook he may not know.

#note No great options.  This is best for equity, though it gives up two easy S hooks.

#note Considered (RE)IN I11, hoping he doesn't think of REINK.  But, this is too easily blocked with short 2 letter plays.  I want to wait for the K to get played, and I can make RIN.  Or maybe another setup will arise.
>Emil_R: HO G2 .HO +23 313
>E_Tran: IINRSTU H12 .UT +3 302
#note with the H dead, this setup looks pretty good.  A play like ZI(T) would hurt, but this can be difficult to block.  Sim is not convinced of my setup, saying H12 RUIN or F4 RUIN are best: about 8 win% better.  sizeable mistake
