#note I would play WAB in retrospect
>Ed: EEIINQT 9G QI +25 25
>JD: AEIJLTW 9K TAJ +24 52
#note ed played QI very fast. to me it suggested he might have a bingo rack since he's usually more methodical. my placement of TAJ gives up a lot of equity relative to WIT or TAJ at 10H, but I was willing to do it for the board control.

#note grrrrrrrrr...chickened out on EMETINE
>JD: EILOOVW 10F VIOL +31 83
#note the board was heading in a good direction with this play
>Ed: AELNTUU M9 .AUNT +24 67
#note considered JUNTA.  not sure how to decide which is better.  If I remembered the Y hook, I probably would have gone with JUNTA

#note A6 CRUXES
>JD: AEORRTU A6 ROUTE +18 165
#note played this instead of ROUE to flip over an extra tile with both blanks lurking

#note I did not find ADEPTER at C3 for 3 more points!
>Ed: ADDGKOS C3 OD +19 289
#note 3A DHAK.  This was a tough rack for me -- I didn't see any plays that I liked.  DHAK looks fine.
>JD: GLNOOSW D3 GOWN +31 288
#note or WOG, sim is close
>Ed: ADGGKPS -ADIP +0 289
#note 11A DOG? doesn't seem like it scores enough
>JD: EEILOOS E4 SEEL +25 313
#note my play fail to show up on quackle's top 50 static suggestions. ed's x4 suggested that he was buiding a rack around the S or blank, and thus it seemed like a bad time to open with WOOLIE. I can also play OE at E5, but that ust allows him to score on column F and doesn't get me closer to any tiles that I need. in summary I thought that the board was ugly enough to justify my play, but perhaps WOOLIE or OE win me more games.

#note 14L PYA.  completely missed the Y hook on JAUNT

#note nice play
>JD: AAIKLNY 14M YAK +36 383
#note my only win! I saw GALYAK and realized it wouldn't be enough
>Ed: ?RV 3I VaR +18 373
#note I'm not sure that I should've tried to outrun him with SEEL, but in this case it was enough!
