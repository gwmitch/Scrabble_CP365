#note I needed this win just to at least have a winning record (I so badly underachieved compared to my expectations) and because I played my most horrific game of the tournament against her earlier when I attempted DENIMLIKE* and GRENADED*.  I have not uploaded that and will not upload that because I used most of it as scrap paper for the trivia contest and lost a bunch of the plays.  (I also lost my first two wins as well, so it isn't JUST because that game was terrible).

If I may be blunt, I'm not off to a roaring start.  Major error.

#note So instead of playing the real bingo I certainly know for one point more, I miss that and play a word I didn't realize was phony?  Awesome.  Truly awesome.  Major error.

#note Wow, that's sloppy.  Borderline major error even though the game is decided.

Major errors (3): NUB (rack vision), LUNT (rack vision), CONNATES (needless phony)
