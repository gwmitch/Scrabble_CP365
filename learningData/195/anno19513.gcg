#note Missed IODID which does this better. But 9H ID might be even better for giving nothing back. I was feeling really tired and anxious during my games with Joe. And sure enough, they ended up being my worst played games of the tournament.

#note Bingo miss. DISSEISE looks familiar, but it's not actually in my study range, so it wasn't revealing itself to me. Tsk...

#note My tracking is way off and I'm completely unaware of how vowel-lite the bag is. I need to cash the DJINN spot now and turn over one more tile with DAWN. At the time, I though that set up ZA. But... yeah, my tracking was off. This is a crucial error to top off a pretty poor game.

#note It's looking grim for Joe here. But he'll get a welcome surprise in the bag.
