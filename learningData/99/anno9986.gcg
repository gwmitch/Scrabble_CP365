#note challenge
>Joe: EORUX F3 ROUX +56 196
#note I didn't write down most of my racks.  I remember having an E because (R)EX wouldn't work.
>Linda: ORT B10 ROT +16 54
>Joe: EGILNOS 3F .ESOLING +72 268
#note I was 50% on BREAKINGS, so I chickened out on ELOIGNS/LINGOES/LONGIES/LEGIONS and went for the safe play.
>Linda: IQ H1 QI. +36 90
>Joe: NOOYZ 14A .NOOZY +52 320
>Linda: AF 15D FA +29 119
#note Scored as 28
>Joe: DEEILNS K2 S.DELINE +68 388
#note Still 50% sure on BREAKINGS for ENSILED/ENISLED/LINSEED.  I found another option that worked.
>Linda: CDIOT F8 .DIOTC. +15 134
>Linda: CDIOT --  -15 119
>Joe: AAGILNT C1 ALGINAT. +70 458
#note At this point I'm starting to get a little excited that this could be a personal record. ALGINATE.

>Linda: DD M7 D.D +9 163
#note not sure if this was an attempt to block or what.  D(I)D 2G scores a couple more.
>Joe: CDEHPRT F8 .CH +16 553
#note I wrote down this rack.  Sim says D7 HARPED.  I say that I'm really close to a column O bingo.  12A ITCH may accomplish this better, but with both blanks out, I'm also creating an S hook.
>Linda: I 1H .I +11 174
#note thinking she must be close to something
>Joe: ADEEPRT O7 R.PEATED +62 615
#note Didn't know DEPARTEE.  Saw 12F ADEPTER, but thought I could set up another bingo by playing to the right.  Both blanks still out.  I probably could have gotten away with N8 REPARTED* for more, but if this was going to be a big game, I wanted it to be legit.
>Linda: AP N10 PA +22 196
#note Scored as 26...wow i really wasn't paying attention

>Linda: ?STU 13G bSUT +10 226
>Linda: ?STU --  -10 216
#note I feel kind of bad that this happened, but she hit her clock.  All part of the game.  I didn't realize what she was trying to do till she was pulling it off the board.
>Joe: ?NRU 10H RUNs +14 703
#note Didn't see D10 UNRoOF, didn't know SIDELINER. for ?URN choices.  Final score recorded 709-209.
