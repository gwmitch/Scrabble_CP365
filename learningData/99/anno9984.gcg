#note The sim says to exchange leaving CE, CEI, CEK, C, or E.  I'm sunk either way, but it's a good idea not to fall too far behind playing through drek, or so I've heard.  Still, why do that when you've got hubris like this?  :P
>David_Gibson: ADINTTY E8 DITTANY +81 81
#note :(
>Ryan_Fischer: CDEEIII G5 DIC.IE +17 31
#note EDENIC for 24, leaving II?  I didn't know it.
>David_Gibson: BMOOR H1 BROMO +39 120
#note Held and released.  It's been too long.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHINNR F10 HIN +32 63
#note NAH might be a little better.  Shuts down less, and leaves me the A to play through.
>David_Gibson: JY 3G J.Y +25 145
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEINR 4H .ANIA +19 82
#note I think MEANIE is too aggressive.  Not that this is much better.  REEN(JOY) is cute, but not cute enough for the leave.
>David_Gibson: MX K3 M.X +24 169
>Ryan_Fischer: EERRSUW 12B REW.. +16 98
#note WE is simple enough, creates an S hook.  I was fixated on getting rid of that R, balancing.
>David_Gibson: IRTZ 14A RITZ. +34 203
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORRSU C5 REAROUS. +60 158
#note Decided against CAROUSER 'cause I wanted to leave that side of the board alone.  Figured it'd be too easy to close it off, hit me back.
>David_Gibson: BLOOP B2 BLOOP +42 245
#note Maybe I'm wrong.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIOTTU A5 GOUT +24 182
#note TAUTOG and AGOUTI are too fast.  Figured this was the best balance of points and leave.  Need a bing again and fast.
>David_Gibson: ?EILLNS M1 aINSELL +72 317
#note Notta chance.  This is clever because if he senses I'm bingoing, he can hit 1L hard.  And as it stands, I can't do either.  BELLINGS and ILLNESS are better.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEILST 1K AL.TE +15 197
#note Hated it, had to do it.  TE(L)IA is interesting.

>Ryan_Fischer: ADEFGRS I8 DEFRAGS +76 303
#note Great, I've cut the lead to 77.  Now I'm gonna draw the blank, bingo again, and win.  Right?  RIGHT?!
>David_Gibson: VW 12H V.W +13 393
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEFIQV E1 QI +15 318
#note Can't block, Champ says (S)IEVED.  Ugh.
>David_Gibson: ?ACIOSU O1 .dACIOUS +86 479
#note All the bingos were vertical, yet I was laid out flat.
