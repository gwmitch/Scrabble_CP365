#note Wasn't sure about placement--perhaps 8D is a bit better due to overlaps.
>Leesa: OO I7 O.O +12 12
>Noah: AEEIKOS K8 .OKE +16 42
#note I wanted to go for a bingo, so not a huge fan of ASKOI and OAKIES(T). Especially against Leesa, an open player, on a board that's going to be pretty open for awhile, I may as well shoot for bingoing.
>Leesa: GIR 12K RIG +17 29
>Noah: AEFIOST J11 OF +15 57
#note There are some other plays available here, like FO(G)IE and FOE, but I thought there was a good chance she had S or ? because of her fishing.

>Noah: EENORUV H11 VOE +13 292
#note It was either this or ROVEN. ROVEN just might be better because it only opens one big lane, closes some other minor ones, and gives a very easy way to close next turn. On the other hand, it keeps the bottom open as well, and I find the bottom much more dangerous. Yet VOE still allows some bottom bingos, so maybe just ROVEN.

#note Tough bingo here! Neither of us could see it: ScIO(L)IST.
>Noah: CDELMRT D10 CE.T +6 408
#note I spent a long time here. Quackle indicates that the best play is (U)M, because she has to sac points to block big stuff like RED(U)C(E).
