#note I can see why this seems ok in static eval and suffers in the sim. I'm keeping consos, but blocking the A and one of the I's. NADA or DATA is better. Or maybe burn the S with DISH?
>Hildebrand: ?ENORUV 3C UN.ROVEn +78 112
>Tunnicliffe: DILNSTW G2 W.LD +8 60
#note Maybe tack on the S?

>Tunnicliffe: AEFLNTY 5G .AFTLY +26 297
#note Didn't see FETIAL L4 (altho I looked there) or 8K FLY. Saw H1 LEVA but turned it down. DAFTLY was weak and I knew it.
>Hildebrand: EGI C12 GIE +11 293
>Tunnicliffe: BEENOOX 15A BONE +26 323
#note EXON is insane. And I dont need to rush the X. I still like this play.
>Hildebrand: EU J9 .U.E +7 300
>Tunnicliffe: AAEJNOX 14B J.AN +42 365
#note Have this and LOX to choose from. Both score well and weaken (but dont block) bingo lanes. Tough call.
>Hildebrand: IK J2 K.I. +17 317
>Tunnicliffe: AEMOSTX G11 .OX +38 403
#note I pondered this position for a long time. It seems that going up 85 will make it hard for me to lose even if he does bingo. Unless he hits a really big one. I dunno, I probably fucked this up.
>Hildebrand: ACEEHRS 15H .EACHERS +101 418
#note SHIT!
>Tunnicliffe: AEMMSTU B6 SUMMATE +69 472
#note Can't win, so guess on this. Oh shit, it's good. Didn't expect that.
>Tunnicliffe:  (EER) +6 478
