>Noah_Walton: AAGOQRX 7F GOX +27 27
#note Or QUAG. I thought this was more defensive in the long run, but actually that doesn't make much sense. So maybe QUAG, since I'm playing Isaac.
>Dr._Lethal: EEY 9E EYE +14 28

>Dr._Lethal: EFT B6 FE.T +15 43
>Noah_Walton: EEEHQRT -EQ +0 56
#note Felt EEHRT was better than EHRT because it gives me a higher likelihood of drawing something like FEATHERED. u
>Dr._Lethal: EIOTW C2 TOWIE +21 64
>Noah_Walton: EEHKORT D1 KORE +40 96
#note Or HOWK, but EHT seemed more conducive to the board than TREE.
>Dr._Lethal: IIIII -IIIII +0 64
>Noah_Walton: EEHNQTT E2 TENTH +28 124
#note My old nemesis is back again!
>Dr._Lethal: V -V +0 64
>Noah_Walton: ADDEENQ 10F ED +20 144
#note EXUDED is pretty neat. I think I like this better given his exchange, but EXUDED isn't bad,
>Dr._Lethal: CEP 11D CEP +22 86
>Noah_Walton: ABDEINQ 6E .AD +24 168
#note Or CEBID. But I preferred this because it kept things tighter.
>Dr._Lethal: ?AIILST A8 .ITALISe +85 171
>Noah_Walton: BEINOQU 14A .EQUIN +34 202
#note Bye bye nemesis!

>Dr._Lethal: ?ADILOS M8 hALOIDS +81 275
>Noah_Walton: ELLORSZ 12J ZOR.L +28 266
#note Figured my chances after ZILL were around 50-50, while my chances after this were closer to the chance he had no S this turn. Seems like a good play.
>Dr._Lethal: AIN N9 NAI. +14 289
>Noah_Walton: EILMPSY O8 YIP +32 298
#note I saw LIMPSY. I did not know it worked with an E. Of the other plays, I like this because it limits his option and keeps the S, which is strong. Something like IMPLY isn't controlled enough for my taste.

>Dr._Lethal: AEMNRV 3H VERM.AN +26 325
>Noah_Walton: CFGNORU H1 GU. +21 391
#note I missed FUR(L)ONG. This is the right endgame idea, but wrong execution. FOU(R) is the correct blocker and best play.
