>Evans_Clinchy: EIJOOQW I6 QI +19 19
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ??MNTTV J5 ViNT +23 49
#note This is Brad's rack, and VINT# looks best! How often do you see a 23-point play with a blank on turn 2? Crazy.
>Evans_Clinchy: DEIJOOW K7 DOWIE +29 48
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AFT G8 FAT +22 71
>Evans_Clinchy: BDEJOST L4 JOBS +36 84
#note Neither of us was sure whether KYBO# took an S. It does, and JOBES# 11D for 49 looks best here.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: ?AEMNST L9 ETAMiNS +77 148
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEMOTU 15F DEMOTE. +30 114
#note Not so good. Wish I had known MOUSTED#.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: APX M3 PAX +42 190
>Evans_Clinchy: EIILTUV 14F ETUI +19 133
#note VLEI# looks a little too ballsy, but it does lead the sim in win percentage. Maybe ballsy is good when losing by this much. ETUI valuates best, though.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: CELLOST 11A COLLETS +75 265
>Evans_Clinchy: AIILNOV A5 AVIONI. +36 169
#note Didn't know VILIACO#
>Brad_Whitmarsh: DEER M11 REDE +23 288
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEHILN 12B HAIL +27 196
#note This valuates well, even though it blocks bingos. Gotta score as much as possible at this deficit.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: CEOR N2 CERO +36 324
>Evans_Clinchy: AEFGNSZ 13F ZAG +37 233
#note Missed F(OH)NS.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: AER J10 ARE +14 338
>Evans_Clinchy: EFGNRSW B10 F..NS +51 284
#note Found it one turn late.

#note Shrug.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EHINPRU C3 PU.H +20 391
>Evans_Clinchy: AGIR 13A ..G +16 355
#note Brad was down to a couple seconds, so I figured pushing him over would net me a few spread points.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EINR 4C .N +8 399
>Evans_Clinchy: AIR 15N .A +15 370
#note At this point I still didn't wanna go out, because I didn't think he had an out either.
>Brad_Whitmarsh: EIR 8D REI.. +12 411
#note I didn't see that one.
