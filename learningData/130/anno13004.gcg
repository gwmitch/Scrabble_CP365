#note given his last play I felt pretty good about INTWINE (trying to cut down on his bingoes) but quackle much prefers upping my bingo percentage next turn by playing WIN...given a leade I still think INTWINE going up 49 makes the most sense.

#note didn't matter too much, figured I would block a cheap X play here. I have the case Es, but I would rather not play APE so he doesn't know that that's the case

#note I shouldn't give him a shot at GAFFER. playing IF is fine. I may even draw a bingo.

#note conrad's nifty endgame actually beats championship player's suggestion since I didn't block lacunar
