#note nicely spotted
>JD: AEEGRRT 2A REGRATE +76 397
#note astonishing, I totally didn't see GREATER at A1. Only saw REGRATE. likely cost me the game...
>Doug: GKO A1 G.OK +42 441
#note it's hard to say how much better GREATER would've been, but it looks like it wins me something like 20% more games.
>JD: BEIIRSW 1G BREWIS +41 438
#note I couldn't see anything better but the best play is ingenious and counterintuitive...BIS at 13L sets up WEIR as an outplay keeping WIRE up top so he can't sacrifice too many points to block. BREWIS is 6 points back overall. they both still lose
