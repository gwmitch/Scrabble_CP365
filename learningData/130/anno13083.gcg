>Matthew_Larocque: ABHINOZ --  -40 0
#note Yeah... no
>Wendy_McGrath: IPRTW 8H TWIRP +26 26
>Matthew_Larocque: ABHINOZ K5 BAI.N +14 14
#note Well that really mucks things up. This play is terrible too. I missed (P)HOBIA and ABHO(R). I don't know why I felt like I HAD to play a word vertically instead of a short parallel play. 
>Wendy_McGrath: IMV L4 VIM +24 50
>Matthew_Larocque: HOORTTZ J5 OH +34 48
#note Hey, now I know TOROT is a word.
>Wendy_McGrath: AQ H6 QA. +12 62
>Matthew_Larocque: EHORTTZ M5 TET +19 67
#note (P)OTZER.... forgot that was a word. Also, (P)OTHER. I opted against Z(A) because the Z seemed more useful than that. But maybe I should be trying to get in bingo shape faster rather than sooner.
>Wendy_McGrath: ?AEFGLN 9B FLANGEs +74 136
>Matthew_Larocque: DGHORSZ D8 H.RD +12 79
#note Taking a gamble for ZIGS or ZAGS. However this could be a disaster if she has a Y. Sim says just play Z(A)G.
>Wendy_McGrath: EILS 12A LIES +28 164
>Matthew_Larocque: CDGOSTZ B11 D.TZ +28 107
#note Sheesh. Now the sim wants Z(I)G to set up my S.
>Wendy_McGrath: EF 11D .EF +14 178
>Matthew_Larocque: CGOORSS F11 .ROG +12 119
#note Eh, what the heck. I have two of them so why not? GROSS N2 is 35 points though.
>Wendy_McGrath: EX G12 EX +36 214
>Matthew_Larocque: CDIOSST H12 CODS +48 167
#note Nice. My odds are still kind of slim, however.
>Wendy_McGrath: AJO 15H .OJA +11 225
#note Interesting that she passed up JO 8A.....if she just continues to outscore me it would probably be much more effective.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIOSTUY 15A OY +33 200
#note YOU for 25 instead? I mean, I dislike Us and almost never keep one on purpose, but I didn't expect YOU to sim clearly ahead of YO.
>Wendy_McGrath: GIKN 12F ...KING +28 253
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIRSTU C7 EE. +9 209
#note Pretty painful, but I I know if I open up another spot she's going to block and sacrifice any scoring plays that she might have.
>Wendy_McGrath: BEEN B4 BEEN +10 263
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IRSTUU -UU +0 209
#note Damn. There's my rescue bingo and I barely even looked because of the ugly doubled Us. I'm not playing URUS N2. I'm surprised the exchange ranks so far down, given the sim wanted me to sacrifce 8 points just to play the U off my rack.
>Wendy_McGrath: CDIT 5B .DICT +16 279
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IRRSTW D3 WR.T +14 223
#note Maybe WRI(T) F2 instead? Yeah I think that's way better, puts the W and R out in the open.
>Wendy_McGrath: EINU F2 UNI.E +9 288
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IRSY 7G Y. +9 232
#note Dunno the rack but I probably didn't have a bingo because the Y is bingo kryptonite.
>Wendy_McGrath: IO 3D .I.O +8 296
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAILRS N7 AeRIALS +60 292
#note I literally chickened out on SOLARIA. Come on.  I also completely overlooked the D hook for UNITE. I didn't even know the G hook. This choice was......  less than optimal, that's for sure.
>Wendy_McGrath: AEPR O5 APER +24 320
#note Lucked out that she didn't have anything better here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AMNOOSV A1 NOVA +29 321
#note I draw a convenient out-in-2, while she has 3 Us. This was a stolen game.
>Wendy_McGrath: AELUUU M13 ULU +10 330
#note Since I'm going out, LEA 11J is better for her.
>Matthew_Larocque: MOS H1 MOS +23 344
>Matthew_Larocque:  (AEU) +6 350
#note I got a -10, still eked out a questionable victory.
