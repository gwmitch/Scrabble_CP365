#note doilter#. i can't be TOO mad, but i can be a little mad because it's in my list of 7s that i barely studied right before the tourney, instead of spending more time studying to not just waste my $100 entry fee. (-30)

#note LINO scores 3 less but is comparable, maybe a bit better. LODEN is best. (-2)

#note awful awful awful awful awful awful awful. i was looking for a move like ENARM#, but even though i don't know it, i saw and should have played MAMZER 10I. that's fine. I also saw MERMAN in that spot which is also fine. this is not fine. why am i so worried about blocking the bottom. keep scoring. (-8)

#note basically gifted him the bingo and win

#note it's between tzar and gram. i didn't see tzar. :/ still, i could get lucky and draw ES :P (-1)

#note now i'm screwed. i'm not sure why the hell i kept ZN, RZ is surely better, but keeping CR may allow me to maximize my luck. (-4)

>cesar: EEFINNZ 10J F.ZE +24 256
#note M9 ZINE. i can't quite understand why i didnt play it; it sets up my F if anything else and scores a little more. i think the main problem i had is that i thought i needed to bingo NOW. i can still get bailed out by a good draw, and after ZINE/FE maybe i'll have a bingo rack that won't miraculously be blocked :/ (-10)

#note well, so much for that
>cesar: EINNPTX D11 ..X.N +16 272
#note i mean i laid down NIX but then took it back thinking that's not gonna win. i don't even know why i'm trying to win, there's no way to win anyway, so just play NIX or NEXT or something like that. (-3)
