>Tasha_Asberry: ?CEFINR 8D CoINFER +78 78
#note FaNCIER for two more points.  And I'm only posting this club game because it's the very first game that I consciously tried to pay attention in end game.  I'm trying to improve, you see.  Will I find the correct sequence or will I make a Tasha-like blunder?
>Al_Helfgott: EFW 7I FEW +24 24
>Tasha_Asberry: EORTUUY 9H EURO +20 98
#note Al told me after the game that I blocked a bingo with EURO (he had something through the N).  Of course, 7E YOU also blocks the bingo and keeps a better leave.  To be honest, I wouldn't have played it had I seen it.  Well, if I were playing Andrew, I would have played YOU had I seen it.  But I'm playing Al so EURO is better.

#note ...
>Tasha_Asberry: AEKTUVY 5K YAK +40 138
#note Any number of threes or fours can go here and I saw them all.  I chose YAK because it's the only play that scores more than 35 and prevents any parallel plays at 4L.

>Tasha_Asberry: AIINPTT 11B PITA +20 194
#note If were playing Ellen I would have just played PAINT (I saw it and passed it up).  But I'm playing Al, so a play on row 11 is better.  I do like TITIAN better though.  I was actually looking for a six that would fit nicely, but I just didn't see it.

#note Trying INBOX* would have been downright insulting.  I passed up on K11 BOX (which sims near the bottom) because I wanted to block row 1.  I didn't think he would have a 3x3, but there's no need to just give up an 80 point bingo.

>Al_Helfgott: EGGILNS N5 SNIGGLE +74 390
#note This play surprised me.  I saw bingos in the pool, but not this one.   In fact, I almost held the play, but didn't.  I don't even remember LEGGINS/ NIGGLES/ SNIGGLE.  Man, I just got through reviewing the low prob stuff.  Mid prob stuff next then!
>Tasha_Asberry: EEGIRTV O11 RIVET +29 487
#note Okay that's it.  I'm tired of this messing up the endgame crap.  I'm gonna practice real hard and I'm gonna be an endgame master by February!  I was just trying to block DAZE while giving myself an out.   Well, this is improvement from how I usually do in endgame.  Normally, I'll make a play that has a valuation of -9.5 or something.
