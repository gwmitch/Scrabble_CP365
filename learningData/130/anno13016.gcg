>Wes_Y: ?EENRST H8 .NTERErS +74 86
>E_Tran: ABEILMN 11E MIN.ABLE +98 166
#note Wasn't completely sure on this.  I knew MINABLE was good though, and figured most of those take the E.  I also thought it was likely he wouldn't challenge, as he kibitzed after LIFTGATE that he had no idea, but would trust my word knowledge.
>Wes_Y: ACIO -  +0 86
#note He challenged
>E_Tran: AHIJTWW L10 J.W +26 192
#note Should I take the points here with HAJI?  It's a lot of points.  Or go crazy and play HAJ to set up my I?  Sim seems to like 12C WHIT, as JAW has a lot of synergy.
>Wes_Y: ACIO M7 CIAO +19 105
>E_Tran: AHIOQTW 10F QA. +65 257
#note The board is so tasty.

#note So tasty
>Wes_Y: EKR 8L K.ER +39 154
>E_Tran: BDDELOR B12 BOLD +20 338
#note Ooh, 13A BODED is beautiful.  My only concern is not letting him bingo 3 times to catch up, so I first want to block off 15A.
>Wes_Y: AAEG 15A A.AGE +27 181
>E_Tran: ?DEOPRR 5E PREDa.OR +90 428
#note This is pretty safe, and he might not think of the Y-hook.  Honestly, at this point, I want a blowout and to make a personal record.  So, maybe PARROTED would be better, to set up a big X (or Y) spot.
>Wes_Y: OOT O13 OOT +16 197
>E_Tran: IINNNOU 3J .NION +10 438
#note Thought INION was phoney, and he might put an S on this, and I could get a free turn.  That could've been bad.  Of course, this blocks the bingo line at O, and that's dumb, too; I should try to hit it myself and hit 600 or 700.

>E_Tran: AEFISVX B9 AX +52 555
#note At this point, I finally realize I have a shot at a all-time personal high, and I want to keep all dangerous lines open
>Wes_Y: DTY 8B T.DY +20 238
>E_Tran: EFIRSVZ B5 IF +28 583
#note aww, he blocked FRIZ for another bajillion points.  I'm hoping to draw an A/O, and hit the A1 spot.
>Wes_Y: ACUY 15H .AUCY +14 252
>E_Tran: EIORSVZ A1 ZEROS +48 631
#note This is bad.  I missed ZORIS.  I might also be V stuck (though he hasn't been tracking).  
>Wes_Y: HIOSV 13A H.S +36 288
>Wes_Y: HIOSV --  -36 252
>E_Tran: IV 13F VI. +7 638
#note Misadded somewhere by 10.  If I played ZORIS, I could've added another 6 points, for 666!
