>Chris_Cree: DDEHKNS -DHK +0 0
#note He said his rack was SHEND + K + another clunky consonant, so he traded three holding DENS
>Matt_Canik: AHIIRTT 8G HIT +12 12
#note Normally I'd open with AIRTH, but not after he trades 3 after thinking for 2 minutes. 
>Chris_Cree: DEEINOS 7H OE +8 8
#note He said he drew this. 
>Matt_Canik: AAEIPRT 6G APTERIA +69 81
>Chris_Cree: ADEHINS 5J HA +19 27
#note And then this. Q likes ASH 9G. 
>Matt_Canik: BDDOPRW M3 BRO.D +20 101
#note This was tough because I knew he was close to something and didn't want to open anything up. B(A)WD looks much better.

>Matt_Canik: DEIKPTW 5E WET +28 129
#note KIW(I) nice whiff matt
>Chris_Cree: CEILRSY F8 CLERISY +81 186
#note Suddenly, he's stopped bitching. Yeah, luck evens out sometimes. 
>Matt_Canik: ADIKOOP 12C AIK.DO +24 153
#note Not crazy about any play that opens up tons of scoring opportunities for him, like OKAPI/ABROAD or OKAPI(S).

>Matt_Canik: JNOQTUW A11 JU.ON +45 240
#note Had a hard time deciding between JUPON and QUOT(E). Didn't want to play the U without the Q, but it was too many points to pass. Quack said it's the right call by ~3 points.

#note I don't see a pressing need to bingo here. I will have nice racks with these blanks for the est of the game, so I figure I'll just mess around til I draw a bingo that hits ABROAD or he opens up something better. This sims above the only playable bingo, TRu(D)GeRS for 60.
