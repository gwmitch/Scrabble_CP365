>Matthew_Larocque: CCDEEEO 5E COE.CED +48 48
#note What were the chances of that happening? One of my favourite non-bingo plays in this tourny.
>Miriam_Gregory: DETUV F2 DEV.UT +16 46
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEEELS 8A ABELES +38 86
#note I phonied on purpose but it wasn't necessary.... I just didn't "see" the bingo, har har. She did hold, but probably let it go because of her impending bingo.
>Miriam_Gregory: ?GIRRST C3 GRItT.RS +70 116
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFIIOT 6J FOE +30 116
#note I kinda have to play here, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
>Miriam_Gregory: AW 4K AW +14 130
>Matthew_Larocque: AIILMST I3 MI. +14 130
#note Maybe this is stupid, setting up an E I don't have after she played short. Meh.
>Miriam_Gregory: INOORTT A5 ROT.TION +59 189
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILRST 7A .A. +7 137
#note I didn't know (D)IASTRAL. RA(B)AT is incredible.
>Miriam_Gregory: EJU M3 JEU +26 215
>Matthew_Larocque: AILNRST L6 .NTRAILS +68 205
#note Hahaha what the hell. It's not that I was trying to be defensive, I never even looked at the E at H8. Amazing.
>Miriam_Gregory: AGO 8L .OGA +15 230
>Matthew_Larocque: EHILQXZ 2H LEZ +40 245
#note Sets up HEMIC, maybe she won't know it either. Q prefers playing QI right now for 35.
>Miriam_Gregory: ?GINPRU 13E PRUnING. +62 292
#note This is the second phony played on me involving cutting tree branches. Next time I just need to challenge any variation of PRUNE. Except UNPRUNED. That one's actually a word. *MISPRUNED is a phony but has the valid anagram SUPERMIND. But I digress.
>Matthew_Larocque: DHIIMQX 12I QI +24 269

>Miriam_Gregory: AHW E10 WHA. +24 344
>Matthew_Larocque: IIMNOTX 11K M.NI +12 320
#note I was banking on her not figuring out what I was doing here - I need a big X play. Quackle wants me to take the sure points. The top simming play is B12 OXIM which gives me a chance to score well next turn, but it could also backfire. Champ likes (n)IX quite a bit better.
>Miriam_Gregory: EF B10 FE +29 373
#note She plays this without hesitation.
>Matthew_Larocque: IOTX 10N XI +50 370
#note Didn't write this rack down.
>Miriam_Gregory: ALNNPUY D11 AY +25 398
#note Quackle says her best move is NA(R)Y.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKOOST 14A TOKES +31 401
#note I see that she can't do anything at all here, nor stop me from going out.
>Miriam_Gregory: LNNPU 9K U.P +15 413
>Matthew_Larocque: IO F10 OI +17 418
>Matthew_Larocque:  (LNN) +6 424
#note Lucky to win despite her blanks and letting her phony stay on the board. AND getting away with my own phony + blatant X setup.
