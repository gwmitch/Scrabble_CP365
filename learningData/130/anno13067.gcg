#note I was looking for an 8 through the N but I couldn't find one. Because there isn't one. This is a really bad play though.
>Beth_Palmer: EH O4 HE +20 185
>Avery_Mojica: ?BEIIMX 11E XI +22 166
#note Awwww BEMIXI(N)g for 88 at L5... I should have at least seen M3 IBEX.
>Beth_Palmer: ENO M3 ONE +19 204
>Avery_Mojica: ?ABEHIM 12D HIE +26 192
#note Missed BEAMIsH 12A and BoHEMIA 7A. Ugh.
>Beth_Palmer: EGL M7 GEL +13 217
>Avery_Mojica: ?ABBCMO K5 COB +31 223
#note Wow... CaBOMBA. I'm missing all sorts of bingos and I thought there was something in EIILNPU?. I'm so good. I wasn't sure about CABOB either.
>Beth_Palmer: QT K10 Q.T +12 229
>Avery_Mojica: ?AABELM 7C AMEBA +17 240
#note Don't even ask me what I was thinking here. Maybe I wanted her to challenge, hoping she only knew AMOEBA? I don't really know.
>Beth_Palmer: GIZ 8A ZIG +42 271
#note That works too I guess

>Avery_Mojica: ?ACDIOS E1 SOCIAl.D +70 310
>Avery_Mojica: ?ACDIOS --  -70 240
#note So it isn't a word. I remember I was playing on ISC a while back and an opponent tried ASCOPIED on me... I almost did that. The only bingo is ACIDOS(E)s. 
>Beth_Palmer: MNO 6C MON +17 308
>Avery_Mojica: ?ACDIOS 13A CODA +19 259
#note I'm just hoping she'll take the triple at 15A and give me a chance to make an 8.
>Beth_Palmer: ?INOTTU 14D TOUTINg +64 372
#note *sigh* oh well. TUiTION is better.
>Avery_Mojica: ?EIKRSV A11 RE.KS +36 295
#note RICKS is a word and I didn't know it. I kind of gave up at this point.
>Beth_Palmer: LT H13 L.T +9 381
>Avery_Mojica: ?INOORV N10 ..V +7 302
#note Wasn't sure of DEVON.
>Beth_Palmer: RS D5 R..S +22 403
>Avery_Mojica: ?EINOOR 12K .O +8 310
#note There's one tile left in the bag. It's a risk, but I can make the spread pretty close if it's a D or an E is what I'm thinking. What do I have to lose?
>Beth_Palmer: DEGRUUW 13L WE +16 419
>Avery_Mojica: ?EEINOR 4D pIONEER +76 386
#note I would have played PEREION but after remembering INGOTER wasn't good and INGOTED is, I just couldn't do it. Amazingly, there's a better bingo. And it's a 10 letter word. And it's C2 cINE(MAG)OER. :D The final score is 419-395 on my sheet... I'm missing my points!
