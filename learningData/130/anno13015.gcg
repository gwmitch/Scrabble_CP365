#note Bill played PLATED, but missed the center square.
>E_Tran: AEEEIWW 8H AWEE +14 14
#note Inferring PLATED, sim likes exchanging.  I figure Bill will miss a lot of the 8s I may set up for him... but that might be a bit risky.  Should exchange, and let him blow up his rack.

#note This game is gonna get ugly.  I know I'm a much better player, so should welcome an open board, but I wanted to be safe and play a closed-ish board with an S/blank, hoping he opens, I snatch the only spot, and then my job of closing the board is mostly done.

#note Better not to bingo here?  RIG or IGLU are worth considering.  I didn't like any options, so I made this standard play.  Should think longer here about not bingoing.
>Bill_P: EFINS 14J FINES +55 132
#note Pretty much negates my bingo
>E_Tran: DDLLNNY L12 L..Y +22 205
#note Was afraid of a big play at 12L.  Given my rack, I should be playing LINED or NIDED.  Y counts as a vowel, and my next rack could get really ugly.

#note G4 Bond was tempting, but I wanted to kill the most dangerous line.  He's unlikely to bingo thru the M.  Want to keep the game tight.

>E_Tran: BDFHNOS 4K FOB +21 278
#note Am I too paranoid here?  I didn't want to give any lines, if possible.  FOHNS, FOND/MIKED score a lot more, but give him a oneshot chance at bingoing to make it close.  Also considered FOHN 4K.  But, it seems the cons outweigh the pros

>E_Tran: DGHMNNS -DGMN +0 292
#note Though about just HM (two spots for it), but was afraid I might draw two consonants, and he would open the board and I would be helpless.  With the case S, G(I)N is good, but a tad risky.  With a vowel heavy pool, keeping HNS is fine.

>E_Tran: CHNOOST B10 CO. +13 305
#note Saw the possibility of HOSTA O11 next turn.  The B line isn't too much of a threat; I should be focused on blocking up that open V, and making sure he can't fork the board.  Instead, I made this play, going for HOSTA.  Just taking points with HOST, or 6K TOSH are also good.  TOSH blocks any future threats in the O-line, so I think I prefer that.
>Bill_P: AEGR 2J GRA.E +26 261
>E_Tran: DHNOOST O1 OD +20 325
#note 6K TOSH scores, and blocks bingoes.  O1 SNOOD also does the trick.  I was still focused on HOSTA - figured the points would help me outrun even if he bingoed.

>E_Tran: AHNOSTU O11 HOST +32 357
#note I finally get HOSTA, but to play it I have to empty the bag.  *sigh*  1K OH is safest, duh, in case he has a bingo ending in A.
