>Josh: ?EEIIOX 8G OI +4 4
#note Game 1 at club! What a crazy rack to begin the night with. I fried my brain trying to justify this play, but in the end, it seemed best, as it set up my X better than the other OI. I also considered exchanging keeping the X, not keeping the X, and an 18-point X play. Nothing looked appetizing, and this seems like it would induce the most mistakes. I think I should have played OI the other way though, since although it doesn't set up my X as well, if I do manage to play XI next turn, it won't be as dangerous as playing EX on the other side of OI, as EX takes many front hooks and XI only takes an S.
>Michael: EGLOV 7G GLOVE +19 19
>Josh: ?EEEISX 9F EX +36 40
#note This turn, I consdiered EXES and EX. EX seemed better since my leave seemed to hit a bingo more often than the leave of EXES, and since I retained a hook to GLOVE. But the numbers prove me wrong here, and I concur. Indeed I bingo more often after EX, but the six points actually seem worth the reduction in bingo%, just barely. I might agree with this, only since it's counterintuitive to throw my S away here.

>Michael: EEJPUVZ --  -26 37
>Josh: ?AAEKTW 1H WATA. +30 152
#note Maybe WATA(P)E instead. It's close. Considered both, thought KE was too much balance to throw away for 3 points. Of not, K5 TW(E)AKEd is 61, but not worth it!
>Michael: CNNTY 3K T.NNY +16 53
#note He probably missed CYT(O)N this turn and last. He probably didn't know the word.
>Josh: ?EEKLOQ 5K Q. +22 174
#note let's see if I can hit my fish
>Michael: AFGN 10B GAN.F +34 87
>Josh: ?EEKLOS O1 KE.hOLES +176 350
#note wow. Only thing luckier than my S draw would have been an H draw!
>Michael: ACLP 8A CLAP. +36 123
>Josh: AIILRUU B8 .I.ULAR +16 366
#note Playing this for the long-term benefits of preventing a 3x3 from being opened, and cause it scores and doesn't really open anything.
>Michael: DEZ A13 ZED +52 175
>Josh: AADEIOU 2D AUDIO +15 381
#note I could also just score with ZAIDA or A(N)ODE at N2, the latter of which I missed. I preferred opening scoring spots for no reason. N6 ADIEU is 19 too, and I missed that too.
>Michael: ACMR 1A CRAM +40 215
#note Apparently I blocked his bingo. It was probably CARMINE, as he kibitzed that he wished this were Collins, after saying that I had blocked his bingo.
>Josh: AEMORRT 13A ..MARRO +38 419
#note I thought I was just making up a hilarious phony. Nope, this is a word... What?
>Michael: EINO J6 O.INE +12 227
>Josh: BEFIJTY N5 JET +27 446
#note Let's start closing things down just to secure the win? Meh, what else should I do? Nothing stands out. When in doubt, just play defense...
>Michael: EGHIW 3A WEIGH +35 262
>Josh: BEEFISY 3G FEY +32 478
#note Maybe 14D BEEFY, since he can't really hit me hard there. Quackle obviously hates it, but I should have continued the trend of playing defense I think. Nah, greediness works too.

#note so damn lucky
