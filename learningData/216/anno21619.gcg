#note wow, GUNSI(G)HT is new! That's probably better than this, defense-wise. I had studied this alphagram, but still wondered if SHUTING was good or not. It didn't matter here, but still. Get it right! Jason challenged this out of desperation.

#note 12L PAAN scores well, leaves a tad better, but doesn't block nearly as much, both short-term and long term, as Jason will have difficulty maintaining scoring while keeping the board open now. Otherwise a play at N10, although unlikely after PAAN, can score while opening things up. I don't want that. If I can prevent that, I win the game. Also, PAAN allows for too many underlaps that also score and open.

#note I had no idea what to play here. Probably just CRI(P), eh? I wanted to block his S well and leave him with clunk.
>Jason: DGKNRST G2 K.N +15 294
#note I guess I had nothing to worry about... This endgame is tough. He shouldn't spend his K yet unless he's playing M6 DR(E)K I think, but this whole endgame needs a larger analysis, as Quackle can't really predict what's to happen, since this endgame takes too many turns probably.
>Josh: CEEMOR 9M REE +14 470
#note missed his best scoring play... Just play (L)EER. I thought LEER and REE were equivalent since it seemed I reduced his score by 3 points. I probably just should have played (H)O for 5 though, which I considered. It just seemed like this ended up doing better in the end.
