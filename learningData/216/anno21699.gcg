#note Lots of time spent looking for a better play, but there's not much else. The sims suggests N1 FUTILE or 6M FIE as other possibilities. FUSTY is also worth considering. They all sim close. I'm fine with FAULT, but not happy about my chances after it.

#note This was the most difficult turn. Looking at the plays available, I think it's clear I tunnelled hard here. I only considered 14A AX, M13 AX, and 3F RAX. Other plays that should have been on my radar are B10 XENON and O5 YARN. Clearly I was too focused on keeping the blank and unloading the X. Both AX placemenets block bingo lanes which my rack wants to keep open. The 14A one also opens up a scary spot for my opponenet to cash, so that was easy to rule out. In the end, I picked AX over RAX because I wanted to be able to win without a bingo if necessary. And because it felt like I still had plenty of time to get my bingo down, with lots of ways to open the board up top. XENON is winning the sim over my play by 3 points. Pretty bad that I didn't even consider it! But I'm surprised that taking a 21-pt lead is apparently worth burning my X?. I would not have played it even if I'd considered it during the game.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ANNRST C7 RANTiN.S +60 302
#note I strongly considered PINNA and NEXT as nonbingo options. But I should not assume it will be easy to get a bingo down next turn. I'll just take it now and try to race the the important unseen tiles (Y seems like it will be big).
>Chris_Cree: AGOU D1 GUA.O +10 285
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEIORTY A11 TOYED +39 341
#note I remember being somewhat low on time and using this turn as a chance to catch up. I played this quickly. So no, I didn't see or consider the OGEE underlaps of OYSTER and DESTROY. Not sure if those are any better though.
>Chris_Cree: LO D8 LO +8 293
#note Nice S setup by Chris.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IIMNRRV 1A VIR.IN +30 371
#note Easy choice to block the seven line, but I'm also scoring points to outrun bingos in other spots. I can't block everything.
>Chris_Cree: D 5D .D +12 305
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACEMORR 15K C.EAM +37 408
#note Understandably, I tunnelled in this corner of the board. Surprisingly, the best play is not under AX! It's 3C CARROM. (Just a one-pt error.)
