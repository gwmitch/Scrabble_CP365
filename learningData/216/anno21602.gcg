#note DISROOT and RISOTTO at 8G are top two (70.27, 69.92)%. OCTROIS at 8F is #3 (69.88%). My play is #9 (69.31%). This is a minor mistake at most. Pretty much any bingo here is fine.

>Reid: CILRSUY 8E CRU.SILY +67 129
#note RUSTICLY at 10E is #1 (90.53%). CRUSTILY at 10D is #2 (90.28%). RIOTOUSLY at H7 is #3 (84.08%). I could have sworn my bingo was valid. I was thinking of CRUISY. This could have been a big mistake. My play is tied for #2 based on valuations of all plays.

>Reid: DEEILST K8 .ISTELED +68 234
#note TILLED at K6 is #1 (83.83%). STILLED at K5 is #2 (83.58%). ED at 9L is #3 (81.82%). I finally intentionally played my first ever phoney. Scott was in a funk even before the game started and my 2 bingos to start did not improve things. I figured he would accept this bingo as just another run of bad luck. It worked great. My play is #1 based on valuations of all plays. Unlike CRUISILY earlier, I don't consider this a mistake.

#note This game was officially scored incorrectly as 464-397. 1 missed bingo and an unintentional phoney. 10 or 11 of my 12 plays were in the top 5. 11 or 12 were in the top 9. If not for the missed bingo I would give myself an A here. But, overall, I give myself a B+.
