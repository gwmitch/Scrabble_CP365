#note This was a really tough turn. Very difficult to quantify my leaves. I played this to score, keep a couple of spots open if I draw an I, an A or AT. So my priority was allowing myself to get rid of the Q as soon as possible. That's really stupid. I can just play QA(T) this turn and shed my Q. If I'm going to keep the Q, I need another, stronger, priority. Stronger defense and a stronger leave should have been that priority. Therefore, I should play LOWE at 9F, which I forgot about during my long decision. This was a bad play.

>Josh: EEGINPR M4 PEERING +70 177
#note Saw all the bingos. I thought PREEING and PEERING both took a front S, but was more sure that PEERING did, so I played it to minimize confusion. I also saw the much safer PERIGE(A)N, but I liked that PEERING made the board volatile when Jason seemed to be weak for scoring. This could have gone wrong though, so I probably should have opted for PERIGE(A)N. If Jason hits one of the spots hard, I'm not a favorite to win the game. That said, I think PEERING is better than PREEING, as PREEING doesn't take a front S, and I'm giving Jason a clear shot at the only hotspot. He's played 4 tiles, so maybe he drew something score-y, although probably not. Hmm...
>Jason: BORY 8A BOY.R +30 170
#note Yeah, PEERING was bad. Although it did have the benefit of tilting Jason if he couldn't hit either of the spots.
>Josh: ?AEIIKS 3K KIS +36 213
#note Here's where I start blowing the game, one missed bingo after the next. I will never miss AKINESIA ever again! Also, KIEl(B)ASI.
>Jason: OOX C3 OXO +31 201
>Josh: ?AAEHIN L6 AAH +23 236
#note It does get worse people, don't worry. I looked at HEA(D) words for a good minute and a half and couldn't come up with NAILHEA(D)... I also missed the tougher HAcIEN(D)A.

#note suddenly I'm in trouble, but still a favorite.
>Jason: EJN 10B JE.N +28 300
>Josh: ?AHINOS 4J HAS. +28 293
#note Trying to create a difficult lane to block and score. Not sure this is the time to do this, but this also scored really well. The fact that there are two remaining F's makes this a bad play. NI(K)AH is interesting, but if he plays to the N he doesn't give me a lane. Not worth the risk. I think I should play it conservatively with 7G (A)HA.

#note Thought this was unblockable! There are two D's left, silly... I think I should just play GU(L)F at 13L.
>Jason: D 8L ...D +24 369
#note perfect scenario for Jason, as he leaves one in the bag and scores...
>Josh: ?CFGTUU 13L GU.F +16 364
#note unsure what play to make here.
>Jason: ABDNPRT 14C ........D +22 391
#note apparently -3 to 7F D(A)B. When we post-mortemed, Jason suggested that instead of LATERIZED. He was running low on time.
>Josh: ?CETU 4B E..T +11 375
#note I mistracked, I thought he had an I instead of a P. We thought I could win with (A)CE, but that's not true. It loses by 2.

#note This was clearly not my best game! What a disaster, but at least I didn't actually throw the game in the end there. Just on every previous turn ;)
