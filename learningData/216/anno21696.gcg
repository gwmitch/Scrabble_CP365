#note 4H GIAOUR is the other option. I shouldn't have been so worried about blocking IXIA overlaps. Nick's last play suggests he doesn't have good tiles to play there. This is a ~3 pt error in the sim because the leave is that bad.

#note It's possible I am being too paranoid. But 3M QI sets up a really easy spot for Nick to get back into the game. Something like BOSK would bring him within 10. A bingo would devastate me. NIQAB scores 12 less, but it makes the board much harder to bingo on. I think it's the right play. Quackle does not agree, but it maybe doesn't realise that I plan to play the rest of the game as blockily as possible.

#note I was nervous of MARROWY, but was hoping Nick wouldn't have it or would miss it. Or that it would be phony.

#note He's got no possible bingos through the K or hooking WATTS. I can never be sure enough, so I made the pointless block leaving one in the bag. The proper play is to empty the bag. I can't lose in any case, so this is just a spread loss.
