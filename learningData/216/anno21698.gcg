#note Close with a bunch of other plays in the same spot. FILE, FILET, FE, FLEET, etc. I'm not sure why I was averse to keeping the P. I would do FILE in hindsight. Looks like a mistake.

#note I was completely blind to the E hook on JEEZ. Unbelievable! New word blindness is still a big factor. WETHER is 69...

#note My reasoning was that I would need a bingo, but that the M column bingos weren't going to score enough. This opens up high-scoring lines and also digs deep for the blanks. This logic is based on me still not seeing JEEZE

#note Finally I spot JEEZE and almost fall out of my chair. I also realize that because of Jesse's KEN placement, he almost surely doesn't see the hook either. I realize this game is still winnable. I just need to score enough points this turn and then draw a high-scoring bingo either hooking JEEZE or to the Y. My hope is that Jesse will block the Y if he doesn't see JEEZE.
