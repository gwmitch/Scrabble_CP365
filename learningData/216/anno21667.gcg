>cesar: EFHMRTX 9H HEX +25 25
#note quackle likes just FAX keeping EHMRT.. I guess it is the best bingo leave but I really don't agree. HEFT, maybe. -4

>mikey: LLUY M10 .ULLY +20 126
>cesar: AEILMTU L7 ULT.MA +26 81
#note N2 MULIE is the most balanced, open, and therefore best. i forgot about the A hook on WET so ULTIMA/WETA there is also a good choice. -3.5
>mikey: EHTTY N2 TYTHE +33 159
>cesar: ABDEEEI M3 BEE +31 112
#note i actually didn't see M3 BEAD but I'm surprised it's that much better than BEE. I guess it does score. -4
>mikey: IRV 4J RIV.. +16 175
>cesar: ADEIMOZ O1 ZA +35 147
#note i wasn't ready for OYEZ yet, but who know, it could work. i misvalued ZORI. ZIRAM for 42 is best by a little. -3
>mikey: DO 14M .OD +14 189
>cesar: ADEIIMO 5G AIMED +24 171
#note i'm likely in trouble after YOD; so maybe taking the double-double on row 5 may limit the damage. Still, OIDIA 11E looks so much better than my move that I probably have to play it. stupid WETA. -7
>mikey: ?AEFINS 11C FANcIES +75 264
>cesar: ADEIKOQ 10B QI +36 207
#note i was not meant to play this game well at all; i've missed the best move almost every turn. this time it's 6F QADI. i tend to do this when i feel like my win chances aren't good. -9

>mikey: EP 15N PE +25 289
#note damn it, he has a good rack again.
>cesar: ABDINNO C9 B..IDA +30 279
#note maybe i should play G1 NOB, it just seems so dumb when i'm down. I missed 4D BOINK, which gives me a better chance at a bingo. -2
>mikey: ?EEEORV D3 OVERsEE +74 363
>cesar: DNNOPST 6H SOP +36 315
#note quackle agrees that burning my S and playing 6H SOP is my best chance to win. i simply need a lot of points and to get super lucky. A bingo after B12 POND will not win (not to mention it blocks lanes).
>mikey: AGIO 2F GO.IA +12 375
>cesar: DINNRRT 5A DIN.R +12 327
#note of course i saw RANID but i thought it would be too easy to block the only bingo lane after that. I'm aware that an -ATE or similar play is available on row 1, but that is weak. my chances are still pretty bad. -7

#note well, that's an annoying draw.

#note 1G CERT is cool. need more practice on these new wordz. -6
