>Josh: CNT -C +0 0
#note I exchanged 5 consonants keeping NT. Apparently CN is a slightly better leave. Who knew?
>Emanuel: ADEEINR -E +0 0
#note exchanged an unknown tile keeping ADEINR.
>Josh: IMNNOOT -  +0 0
#note Well, he's close and chances are he'll bingo and give me one of the letters I need! This has got to be the correct play! Strategic pass for the win :)
>Emanuel: AADEINR 8F ARANEID +70 70
>Josh: IMNNOOT K5 MON.TION +90 90
#note Could not have worked out better. Especially since he challenged!
>Emanuel: ?AFGIIL -  +0 70
>Josh: AGKRTTX 10H TAX. +27 117
#note Completely missing L4 TAX for 6 more after spending minutes? Check!
>Emanuel: ?AFGIIL 12F FAILI.Gs +74 144
#note I held this but it had to be good. I just knew I had to be wary of FAIL words, since FAILERS* and stuff

>Josh: AENORTU D5 OUTRAN.E +70 216
>Emanuel: CLNW 5B CL.WN +20 198
>Josh: AAELTUY 6J Y.U +40 256
#note I whiffed on LAY(O)UT here in the same spot even though I looked for a longer word... That may very well be better than this. 
>Emanuel: EENORST 3F ONER.EST +70 268
#note yeah, definitely LAYOUT for the more flexible leave.
>Josh: AADEILT 2A TAILED +29 285
#note Now I'm in trouble. I have to hope to draw really nice scoring tiles or really nice bingo tiles. Otherwise I'm kind of screwed.
>Emanuel: ?EEORSS L8 .OS +18 286
#note Emanuel took forever here looking for really tough bingos. He thought CORELESS was no good, missed S(C)lEROSE, and missed TETROSES on column M. What is the other bingo that he missed? If you find this on your own, you are very good at this game! Hint: it's in your interest to find this word quickly... SE(G)O is the only non-bingo play that makes sense. He was down to 4 minutes after this.
>Josh: ADEQUYZ H1 QU.Y +60 345
#note And I had nothing to worry about. But I can't believe what I missed! Wow!
