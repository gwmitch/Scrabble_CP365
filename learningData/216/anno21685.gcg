#note last game of nationals. this was tough because i don't want to play closed; 7F VEG seems the obvious equity choice and I spent about 3-4 minutes debating between that or 7E WEEK. eventually I decided I wanted a more open board. quackle says i'm wrong, giving up too many points. -3.5

>cesar: CGGNNUV J4 VUGG. +17 38
#note this is a pretty terrible draw. VUGGY is probably fine, although GUNKING is very slightly preferred by Quackle.

#note that is a nice draw to CNN.

#note -12. there are many better plays, such as C8 HaDITH, 1C sCHROD, or C10 HITHeR. ORCHiD is actually one point worse than this though.

#note i have FIVE out plays and i missed all of them! for bonus points, find all my out plays. hint, 3 of them are the same word and it's a new one, another one is also new, and the final one is the coolest. -5
