>Reid: EEIKOST I7 E.K +13 13
#note KETO or KITE at J6 are top two (54.03, 52.65)%. TOKE at J8 is #3 (52.49%). I spaced on the CEL hook. My play is #6 (51.61%). I agree with Quackle. This is a medium sized mistake. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EJOS 10F JOES +35 45
#note If Siri had an ess every turn, he would be a world champion.
>Reid: EEEIOST F10 .EE +10 23
#note OE at 11F and TOE at 11E are top two (40.18, 38.97)%. My play is #3 (38.75%). I disagree w/ Quackle. This is a minor mistake at most. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ILRV 13D VIRL +19 64
>Reid: EGIMOST J1 EGOTISM +70 93
#note #1 play. So glad I got a bingo early and that this was unlikely to turn into one of those defensive boards. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IINRW 1F WINI.R +27 91
>Reid: ?AIILTX 4J .AXI +22 115
#note TIX at I3 is #2 (73.38%). I'm still getting use to that word. ILEX at 11D is #1 (74.04%). I agree with Quackle. TIX at 4J is #3 (72.54%). My play is #4 (72.44%). This is a small to middling mistake.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BELS 3I B.LES +35 126
>Reid: ?AAILNT 2A ALATIoN +68 183
#note TAILFAN at E1 is #1 (74.32%). ALATION at 14G is #3 (66.02%). My play is #2 (69.54%). This is a medium sized mistake because of positioning. I agree strongly with Quackle here. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEFM 1A FAME +54 180
>Reid: ACDENOT 5D CATENO.D +102 285
#note #1 play. Finally got the separation I needed. This game is over. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IY D12 I.Y +18 198
>Reid: AHRRSUU 4F UH +12 297
#note KURU at 9I is #2 (95.96%). RASH or HAS at 3A are #1 and #3 (96.33, 95.63)%. I really didn't want to use my ess here. #2 is best for balancing though. My play is #10 (94.47%). This is a small mistake although Quackle thinks I should take the points and keep the momentum. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DFT 11E D.FT +23 221
>Reid: AHRRSUZ 14A HAZ. +38 335
#note RASH from before is still #1 (97.77%). RAS is now #3 (96.80%). My play is #2 (97.38%). I disagree with Quackle here, but even Quackle thinks it's minor. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IN 15A IN +23 244
>Reid: PRRSTUU K7 URP +10 345
#note MAUT at C1 is #1 (97.99%). USURP at K7 is #2 (97.55%). My play is #3 (97.48%). I disagree w/ Quackle here and didn't want to use my ess. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BEN 3A BEN +31 275
>Reid: AORSTUW C6 OUTWARS +67 412
#note #1 play.

#note #1 play. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?DEOOTU L9 OUTDOnE +70 358
>Reid: AEGGOQR 15H GORG. +21 457
#note QUA at 7B and QAT at 11J are top two. My play is #3. At first I didn't agree with Quackle, but Quackle has it right here. If I play QUA or QAT, Siri has two outs and I will win by 80 or 79. While I will win by 89, this is because Siri will miss his out. Siri could have reduced spread to 66. I saw one of the outs, didn't see the other. I was hoping to save my Q for the other places. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: NORY B5 OY +26 384
#note Siri goes for points and misses his out at M1 with ROSINY. 
>Reid: AEQ 11J QA. +24 481
#note #1 play. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: NR 13K N.R +6 390
#note PORN at 9K scores 7. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (E) +2 392
#note No missed bingos. 10 of my 13 plays are in the top 3. All are in the top 10. My end game was a little weak, but overall I give myself an A-/A for this game.
