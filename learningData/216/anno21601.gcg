#note #1 play.

#note #1 play.

>Reid: AEFKORV 7G VA..R +22 76
#note FAVOR and FAKER at K3 are #1 and #3 (57.35, 53.72%). I didn't remembe that LOR was valid. I considered KNAVE at F10 (55%) but didn't want to give Robin the easy triple. My play is #8 (52.34%). I like #1. This is a small mistake. 
>Robin_Levin: BBI 12C BIB +40 84
>Reid: EFHKNOS K5 KO. +14 90
#note FOHN at F8 is #1 (56.01%). FES at 13B is #2 (55.05%). SOH at I11 is #3 (53.95%). Quackle really thinks I should use my ess here. In retrospect, I agree. I really didn't want to use it. I like #1. I considered #3 but didn't want to use my E. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #52 based on valuations of all plays. This is a at least a medium sized mistake. I didn't think it was that bad, but I failed to generate any momentum. 
>Robin_Levin: JO 10E JO +27 111
>Reid: EFHINST L4 FIN +20 110
#note KOR looks even worse now. I blocked my own bingo. Quackle still wants me to use my ess. FINS is #1 (50.31%). NEIF and NEIFS are next two at L3 (50.06, 49.82)%. My play is #6 (48.29%). This is a small mistake at most. I didn't want to use my E.

#note #1 play. 
>Robin_Levin: AMN M3 MAN +22 147
>Reid: AEHSTUX N5 EXHAUST +93 227
#note #1 play. This finally breaks up this silly logjam of a game. If I didn't get this bingo, I doubt I would have won this game. 
>Robin_Levin: ?AEGILT 14F ALIG.TEd +63 210
#note ATHELING is 72. LICHGATE and LITHARGE at 14G also score 72. 
>Reid: ?EIMORT O9 MOIsTER +82 309
#note #1 play here. This play, plus the board position, pretty much ends the game. 
>Robin_Levin: CDEOS O1 COEDS +39 249
>Reid: CEGIRRS 15A CRIERS +29 338
#note CRIS at 15E is #1 (95.52%). RICERS is #3 (94.45%). My play is #2 (94.67%). I agree with Quackle here, but this is only a small mistake. 
>Robin_Levin: ORW 13L WOR. +21 270
>Reid: ADEEGOT 15H DO +21 359
#note AGES or ATES at 12L are great plays for top 2 (99.83, 99.80)%. OAT is #3 (99.08%). My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My plays is #12 based on valuations of all plays. This is a medium sized mistake because of board position. It could have been worse. 
>Robin_Levin: DEIV L10 VIE..D +30 300
>Reid: AEEGSTU 13A GAES +30 389
#note #1 play. I figured there was no reason to hold the ess anymore. Robin is not trying to win, she seems content to reduce spread.
>Robin_Levin: DEL M7 ELD +23 323
>Reid: AEILTUZ K10 AT +14 403
#note EXHAUSTER at N5 is #1. LODE at M12 is #2. AZON at F8 is #3. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #6 based on valuations of all plays. I don't consider this a big mistake, just a failure to fully take advantage of the board. 
>Robin_Levin: AY N2 YA +25 348
>Reid: EILUZ A11 ZI. +14 417
#note Top two from last turn have not changed. TE at K14 is #3. My play is #5.
>Robin_Levin: EEIRU 15L .EE. +7 355
#note Robin's play is #5. RIFLIP and ERUV are two and three at I4 and G4.
>Reid: ELU G5 LU. +6 423
#note LUV is #2 to the infamous word that keeps taunting me. LOPE is #3 at 9G.
>Robin_Levin: IRU F8 IR.. +4 359
#note Robin's play is #4. ER at 12L is #1. RIFLIP is #2. ROPE is #3.
>Reid: E 5F E. +2 425
#note #2 here. 
>Reid:  (U) +2 427
#note This game was officially scored incorrectly as 422-360. No missed bingos. 9 of my 15 plays were in the top 2. 12 of 15 plays were in the top 8. Missing EXHAUSTER kept taunting me, but I wasn't the only one. Overall, I give myself a B here. I hate these type of games, but at least I got the win.
