>Reid: ?AAEHIT H4 HETAIrA +76 76
#note #1 play. Almost missed this one. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: ?ILNORY 11D hORNILY +78 78
#note Manop misses LYRICON at 11E for 96.
>Reid: CIMNNOR 10J MONIC +34 110
#note I was proud of my play until just now. I missed the bingo NONCRIME at 5A. MONIC is #2 based on valuations of all plays.
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: EGOOY G3 GOOEY +33 111
>Reid: IIJNRVW 3B JIVIN. +34 144
#note #1 play. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: DOS I3 DOS +15 126
#note Manop is likely setting up his bingo. 
>Reid: AARRRUW M9 W.RRA +24 168
#note #1 play. Would have been stunned if it wasn't.
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: AIMNSTT 2H MATTINS +77 203
#note MATTINS at C9 scores 84, but I think Manop was focused on his hook. 
>Reid: ALRRTUX 1G XU +39 207
#note #1 play. I considered 1L but my spot was more volatile. Apparently, I blocked his bingo too. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: GKO 12L G.OK +28 231
>Reid: ADELRRT O12 .ART +24 231
#note YAR at 7G is #1 (43.86%). OR at N12 is #2 (43.07%). DIRL at L1 is #3 (42.14%). I considered LEAR at 1L but didn't want to use my E. However, there are plenty of E in the bag. Quackle doesn't like the play anyway. My play is #7 (41.02%). This is a small mistake at most. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: ABEU 1L BEAU +38 269
>Reid: ADELORT C3 .DOLATER +61 292
#note DELATOR is #1 at C7 (67.32%). LEOTARD is #2 at C8 (66.12%). TAILORED at E1 is #3 (59.57%). I missed the THORNILY hook. My play is #5 (51.67%). This is a medium sized mistake. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: AEZ 8A ZE.A +42 311
>Reid: DFHIILU 12A FLUID +31 323
#note #1 play. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: ELW A12 .LEW +30 341
>Reid: ADEHIPS 13E APHIDES +73 396
#note #1 play. DIPHASE is 72. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: FGI -  +0 341
#note Manop loses his challenge. 
>Reid: EEEQSTU E5 QUEST +42 438
#note I'll never figure the mind of Quackle. WE at 15A is #1 (99.8%). LED at I11 is #2 (99.67%). HE at G13 is #3 (99.63%). My play is #9 (99.25%). This is a minor mistake at most. I think Quackle thinks I should hold back so that I'm more likely to go out first. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: FGI 14J FIG +30 371
>Reid: BCEEEOP D1 CO.E +30 468
#note WEB or WE at 15A take top two. PEC at N8 is #3. My play is #10. The top two take out Manop's best V play, but I can't catch him with it. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: ENNRV 14A .VEN +14 385
>Reid: BEEP N12 .BE +19 487
#note #1 play here. 
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm: NR 7G ..RN +8 393
>Manop_Phiphatboonserm:  (EP) +8 401
#note 1 missed bingo. 8 of 12 plays in the top 2. All plays in the top 10. Without the missed bingo, this could have been one of my best games ever. Overall, I give myself a B+.
