#note His rack - he made the same mistake I would have, as I never would have seen ECTYPAL. If you don't know the bingo, this is best.  
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIJLO J6 JI.L +27 27
#note His not having floated the A made this much more difficult.  While I have a few options that score (this, JELLO J6, or J6 JOLE), none do a good job balancing the rack and unloading all the decidedly non-bingo-prone clunk.  Q says I should maximize my points with JELLO J6 leaving FII.  I sort of see that, but that might not get me somewhere if I don't draw into an IFIED, IFIES, or IFIER word.   Whatever - this worked out very well.
>Gregg_Speicher: AALOPRU L6 PO.ULAR +22 54
>Jim_Burlant: EFIMOST 10D FOMITES +84 111
#note The other bingo is SETIFORM 12F 64.  This is clearly best.
>Gregg_Speicher: AIQR D10 .AQIR +34 88
>Jim_Burlant: BEENNRT E5 ENTER.N +32 143
#note This was not auto-pilot - K11 BEN looked very tempting due to the ENRT leave. But the problem I had with it was that, if he did something to block up the E or F columns, my bingo might not play.  So I figured I'd turn 6 tiles, maximize my score (this scores 32 where nothing else available scores more than 24) and maybe get lucky and draw a blank.  Quackle says this is a very strong choice (2nd best according to both the 2-ply sim and Championship Player) but not best.  The sim says k11 BEN is best; Championship Player likes 9E NEB, and it says this wins roughly 1-1/2% less often than 9E NEB.  66% to win.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEHV 8A HEAV. +45 133
>Jim_Burlant: BEGNSUZ K11 ZEBU +54 197
#note What was I saying about getting lucky?  This is clearly best.  81% to win.
>Gregg_Speicher: AX J13 AX +54 187
>Jim_Burlant: CEGNSST 15K SCENT +46 243
#note The only 8 in this rack is CONGESTS, and there's no open O anywhere.  The play here is obvious:  take out one of the two row 15 S hooks.  I chose this both for the points figuring that if I had a bad draw I could probably salvage points with something at 15A, which he can't hit if he doesn't have an S. And I liked that this kept multiple bingo alleys open; if I play SCENT 15D as Quackle indicates, what do I do if he bingos down the A or B columns?  Q says this is a 2-point dog and wins 1% less often than 15D scent.  76% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: AEGGLOS H10 .OGGLE +30 273
#note Statically (i.e., strictly score plus leave with no regard to board position) Quackle wants me to play at 15A with EGOS, EGGS, etc.  While this is once again a strong choice (83-1/2% to win, simming 1.8 pts down on the sim winner) the slightly better play is 15A GOAS if Q is to be believed.   Quackle also likes M11 GAG 26.  I might have opted for GAG if it left AELS instead of ELOS.
>Gregg_Speicher: AIMO D2 MIAO +14 218
>Gregg_Speicher: AIMO --  -14 204
>Jim_Burlant: ADEESUW 15A AWES +43 316
#note Now it's time to pull the plug on the S, no doubt.  Too many points are available for a 15A play relative to anything else for me to justify holding onto the S.  Quackle agrees - it's this, WAES, or DUES.  95% to win.
>Gregg_Speicher: AIIMNOU 14M MI +16 220
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINOU D4 UDO +13 329
#note I had to miss one somewhere.  The only options I have that score decently are F7 IDEM 24 (which creates easy lines for 7's) and L4 UNPOPULAR which leaves a seriously vowel overloaded DEEIO.  Since none of the scoring options are particularly good, I might as well just groom the rack for cheap.  The plays that look best here - all of which I whiffed on - are F10 plays like MEOU, MEOUED, or MENUDO, take your pick.  Still 95-1/2% to win.  
>Gregg_Speicher: AEF 14A FEA. +31 251
>Gregg_Speicher: AEF --  -31 220
#note Ewww...I've often wondered why, if UGH is good, EW is not.  No matter, it's not in our dictionary, so off it comes.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRU 6J .U.E +13 342
#note This is the best pure rack balancer I had, but it's the wrong play.  What complicated my decision was that I wasn't sure whether YCLEPT took the S (it doesn't), and I thouight that if it did, this wasn't opening up anything that wasn't already three.  Best per the duck is L4 UNPOPULAR.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEFO 14B OA. +18 238
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEINRS O8 RaNDIES. +82 424
#note Or NERDIEST in the same location.  There are no options available down the O column that double the D.  Per the duck, the game is now officially over except for the final score.
>Gregg_Speicher: EFIIRTT F4 IF +12 250
>Jim_Burlant: DGIKOOR G4 DIRK +25 449
#note Quackle is to be taken with a grain of salt here.  I'm less worried about him hitting down the A column than I am about letting him have an easy 7.  Q wants me to let him have an easy 7 somewhere.

>Jim_Burlant: ADINOTT A8 .INT +7 468
#note And I fall asleep at the switch. I need to look at the pool and recognize that he has an out bingo and block it.  Instead, I get cute, thinking I'm setting myself up to go out in two...
