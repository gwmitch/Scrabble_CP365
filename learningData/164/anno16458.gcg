#note Where to put this? Both sims suggest 8F, but that's unlikely to work. The "book" placement would probably be 8G, but that's likely to lead to problems as well. I don't mind this; the W isn't the easiest thing to work with in the double-double line.

#note Loving the setup potential, especially with EX G13 as backup.

#note I'm not seeing a path to victory after QUOITS 3C, the winner of both sims. AZO in this spot is probably a hair better, though, with so many E's to draw. As the tiles lay, QUOITS would've been right, but not for the reason you might expect...

#note TApparently fishing off OE somewhere has miniscule winning chances? Gunning for what, exactly?
