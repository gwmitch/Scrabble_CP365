#note The context:  this is the final round KOTH game. I'm in first place with 4 wins, and nobody has more than 3 wins.  If I win the game, I win the tournament, period.  If I lose, I may not finish in the money.  As for this rack:  bingoes all over the place with this, but this scores 90 and none of the others (D8 FORMANTS, 7G MATRONS, I4 TRANSOM, etc.) score above the 70's. This is best.
>Darrell_Day: EGI F4 GIE +12 36
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALSTUU 12D U.UAL +12 102
#note FAIL.  I suspected I missd something but the duplicated U's take this rack way past any probability range I have ever studied.  I saw mUTUALS but wasn't sure if MUTUAL took the S.  I never saw the anagram, UMLAUTS, and didn't know SUTURAL and would have never thought to look for pUSTULAR.  The best non-bingo if I want to live dangerously is ULU D12.  Glad I only saw this given his next rack:
>Darrell_Day: ACEIKLS 13G SACLIKE +89 125
#note Clearly the best bingo for Darrell - of note is the sick 5A EKISTICAL.  Darrell is 55% to win with this, but not for long.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AARSTW K7 WiSTAR.A +70 172
#note Surprisingly, nothing available for more than 70 points here. That said, 10B WARRANTS looks a hair better - I never saw it.  Other options include M6 RADWASTE, M8 AWAITERS, and M7 TEAWARES/SEAWATER.  This was held, but released.  65% to win.  
>Darrell_Day: DOO 10B DOO. +9 134
>Jim_Burlant: DEENNPQ 8J P.NNED +27 199
#note Good, but apparently not best.  Quackle says I should play the other E for 4 more points with L3 PENNED.  Regardless, this worked out.  70% to win.
>Darrell_Day: FNO 7G FON +22 156
>Jim_Burlant: EIILQRT 9I QI. +26 225
#note Believe it or not, I almost missed this, as I had been fixated on playing QI 9A for defense.  If my lead were on the order of two bingoes I might do that,  because in that situation, I could afford to give up 42 for TRANQ so long as I didn't give back a bingo.  But with the game this close, the play gives up too much. Quackle agrees:  this is best, and the 9A placement wins 6% less often and sims nearly 14 points down.  84% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AGR 9A RAG +14 170
>Jim_Burlant: EILOORT A4 LOOTE. +21 246
#note It was getting late in the day, and as tough as the latter half of the Holser and Early games had been, I was starting to wear down.  I initially considered WOO 7K to balance the rack.  While that play does well statically, it fares terribly in the sim.  I rejected it because I thought that if I played WOO and he took out the A column, I'd have a no-go.   At the time I put this down, I was content with it - 5 tiles turned, IR leave (probably the best thing I could salvage given this position).  When his next play came down, I realized I'd made a pretty bad mistake.  LOITER, TOILER, or ROOTIER  are better choices.
>Darrell_Day: AIRY B3 AIRY +32 202
#note Just desserts - and if there were justice he'd have hit a huge X bomb on this turn.
>Jim_Burlant: BDIRSTU 2B DUB +30 276
#note I was very upset when he put down AIRY - not because he had the tiles to score there, but because I'd made the sort of mistake that I flat-out know better than to make when I played LOOTER instead of LOITER or ROOTIER.  And this caused an even bigger blunder, as I never recognized the 7 in this rack.  Sad, but true.  I briefly looked for 8's (there are none in this rack) and just didn't look hard enough to find the 7.  I'm still 94% to win, but I should have been 100%.  This is pathetic!

>Jim_Burlant: ?IORSTV 15A VIRTuOS. +83 359
#note And lucky for me, this is Scrabble - it doesn't matter how poorly you play when you double-blank luck-bag your opponent.  TRAVOISE in the same location scores 92 but whatever - this one's over but for the final score.  And at this point I lost whatever focus I had and just moved tiles to end the game.  Quackle never ceases to amuse me - my winning chances are 99.66%.  What miracle can Darrell conjure up to win this game?
>Darrell_Day: ILV M12 V.IL +7 236
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINYZ 1D AZIDE +53 412
#note And when it rains, it pours.  I wondered if I should keep the A in reserve for later, but I looked at the pool, decided that, since AZIDE didn't give back any easy 7's, I should just hasten the end of the game.  
>Darrell_Day: IJ 7C JI. +23 259
>Jim_Burlant: EEGNTXY 15M .EX +30 442
#note Auto-pilot at this point.  Best is a play I didn't exactly look very hard to find:  14B TEENY 54.  
>Darrell_Day: EHINOPT J11 HE.P +32 291
>Jim_Burlant: EEGHNTY 3B .NY +24 466
#note Cute, but TEENY 14B scores 54.  Yeah, you could say I lost focus once I knew the tournament was clinched.
