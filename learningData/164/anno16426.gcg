#note Nine-letter bingos usually have a degree of awesome to them, and this one was no exception, especially as it is the only bingo. A HERALDIST is someone who practices heraldry (decorating medieval shields and tapestries). And there you have it: #10 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown!

#note See the Wikipedia entry for "Variation of the Field," which features many Collins-only words having to do with heraldic shields. If I had a shield, it would be "chequy# gules and argent", but with three little protrusions on each side of the red squares. Wouldn't that be precieux?

#note That's a pretty awesome play in its own right! In our previous game, Eric got down SUBDWARF, which deservedly won a prize. Eric knows a lot of words!
>Carl: AGNSTVZ 3K V.NG +16 224
#note VANGS O9, setting up the Z, would have been sweet. Always ask: "What would Nigel do?" (-4)

#note What a luckbox! Now watch me bollix up the endgame.
>Eric_T: EIILQST 15L .ELT +18 359
#note Nice! Ensuring one of two big Q plays.
>Carl: AO B14 O. +4 495
#note BRONCO. -6 Dunno what I was thinking here. I think I was short on time and didn't see QIS O1. I just saw the 14A hotspot and insta-blocked without looking for something  better.
