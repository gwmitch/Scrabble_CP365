#note Held this for a while, as I hadn't seen it, but decided it made enough sense.

#note Not sure why the sims are liking IF A12/FIE F6 so much. Is AIOTT really that good a leave? It certainly isn't helped by the board, especially after FIE.

#note Quackle agrees with me, while Elise prefers to take the points with ETNA J3. I'd probably still play PIA, but points could be at a premium on this board, so I can see what Elise is saying/

#note BIVALENTS! I saw it, and just didn't believe it took the S. COVALENT and DIVALENT don't. Grr...stupid dictionary.

>Mike: CEEKNST M2 TE.K +22 308
#note STEEK or SNECK at J6 looks best. The punishment would be swift and severe (and perhaps mildly unjust).

>Mike: CEENOSS 8L CO.E +33 341
#note Not understanding why plays down column O (SEEN/EONS/NOES/ESNE) are so much better.

#note Challenged GUMSHOED; while there might be some slim chance according to the computer, it's probably not going to work against a live opponent. Since anything I do is <5% to win, and I'm <95% sure of GUMSHOED, the challenge is >99% right.
