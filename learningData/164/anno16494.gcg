>Matt: EEILRSY H7 YE +10 10
#note Albany round one. EERILY and RILEY sim a bit better than this.
>Benjy: EFIRY 6F FIERY +33 33
>Matt: EIKLPRS 5E KIP +27 37
#note Nothing to think about here
>Benjy: ?HPQS D1 QoPHS +66 99
>Matt: ELORRSU 9E LOUR +12 49
#note ELRSU is apparently a good leave, which makes a couple of plays better than this.
>Benjy: JOW 10D JOW +36 135
>Matt: BEGIRRS 11E BERG +30 79
#note Best
>Benjy: DGO 12D GOD +24 159
>Matt: AACIORS 5J OCA +15 94
#note I played OCA to give myself an S hook. But quackle disagrees, thinking I should still play CAPO.
>Benjy: ITW 4H WIT +16 175
>Matt: AGINRSS L4 S.NGRIAS +70 164
#note Here we go. Scored as 68.

>Benjy: EO C3 OE +17 192
>Matt: EEISTUV 1D .UITE +42 206
#note An M would sure be nice here. This is best.
>Benjy: AEELNOT 2F TOLANE +18 210
#note I was scared because I thought he would put an S down.
>Matt: AENSTUV H11 .UV +8 214
#note GANEV and AVENS score a little too much to pass up.
>Benjy: ADEELN 1J ANELED +28 238
>Matt: AEEINST 14E ETESIAN +69 283
#note Only bingo.

>Benjy: FLORU M9 FLOUR +37 275
>Matt: ?ABIRTX 15K AXITe +59 342
#note Right idea, wrong execution. The best idea is EX, which fishes for bingos such as DIATRIBE, but the second best play is eXTRA, which has the key point of opening up an A instead of an E for Benjy to work with.
>Benjy: ADMNO 15A NOMAD +30 305
>Matt: BCEIMNR B1 MIB +21 363
#note And... I pick one of the three moves that win 100 percent of the time, albeit the worst one. B(AL)M and BE do the same thing.
>Benjy: AADHITZ A1 HA +38 343
#note His best outplays involve setting up AZIDO

>Matt: CEENRV B12 CER. +12 375
#note Best, because it blocks AZIDO
>Benjy: ADITZ 6L .AZI +33 376
#note AZIDe and DITZ are 2 points better
>Matt: ENV O5 V.NE +21 396
>Matt:  (DT) +6 402
