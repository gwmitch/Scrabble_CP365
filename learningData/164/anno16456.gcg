#note You didn't have to wait very long for that one, did you? #6 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown, it's  EXOCYTIC-- which means "pertaining to cellular excretion."  Personally, I've never pooped an iPhone before, but if I did, now I have an adjective for it! ::drum fill:: But seriously folks, stick around, there might be a pre-endgame to figure out.

#note Brownie points if you can spot the other bingo in ?CCIOTXY.

#note If you think Quackle is just gonna lie down and take it, you would be wrong.

#note By the way, do you think I cheated, giving myself a suspiciously low-probability bingo to start against the computer? There were no witnesses, and you can manually enter any rack you like against Quackle. I swear to god, that was what chance gave me. You'll have to take me at my word.

#note Ok, skeptics: I played 107 games against Quackle this year, winning 47 of them, and this was the only one in which I made anything close to an awesome play. Now does it seem more believable?

#note  I determined that there were no 7s (columns A, I) and no bingos through the A. SUNSTONE and NONGUEST play through the O, but you must also worry about SNUGNESS 1H. OH takes out all these threats, and is one of only a few plays that always wins, no matter which tile remains in the bag.
