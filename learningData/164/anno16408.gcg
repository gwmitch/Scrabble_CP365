#note Quackle says this is best
>Jason_B.: ?DEGHRT J5 THR.nGED +74 74
>Allen: IIJMNNR 11G MIN.R +14 42
>Jason_B.: ACENNOT 6C NANOTEC. +65 139
>Allen: AADIJNR 10B JARINA +35 77
#note Thought about putting it at D1, which Quackle likes better but thought that I might prevent a big score from him without giving him the big J play to the triple.  Looking at it now I realize that I should have done it to keep the board open.
>Jason_B.: EFIW 5B WIFE +31 170
>Allen: DIPV C9 V.PID +30 107
#note Getting pretty discouraged - gave up tracking for a while ;-)

>Jason_B.: AFTT L4 FATT. +22 192

>Jason_B.: NQU E8 QU.N +26 218
>Allen: ABC C2 CAB.. +18 158
#note Trying to open up anything for a bingo line...
>Jason_B.: BOX A13 BOX +44 262
#note Ouch
>Allen: ?EILLTU 3B T.ILLEUr +58 216
#note Didn't see (C)ULTLIkE.  Saw the only other bingo.  Still scrambling
>Jason_B.: ARW 7F WAR +19 281
>Allen: ADEOOOR M2 ORAD +18 234
#note Getting rid of the Os seems to be a priority - but I still think I have to score something to get back in it.  Quackle likes the O dump plays of (R)O(T)O or even exchanging OOO better - but regardless my percentage chance is in the single digits
>Jason_B.: EIL N1 LIE +12 293
>Allen: MOOZ 2H MOZO +40 274
#note This is a real Hail Mary - is there any way he cannot have an A or an E when there are 8 of them left?
>Jason_B.: AUV O3 VAU +13 306
#note Jason decided to block the bingo line instead of taking the points

>Allen: EGK 1G KEG +42 316
#note Wow!  I'm actually in the lead!
>Jason_B.: EY 12J .EY +16 322
#note Setting up a possible S play?
>Allen: HIIOPSU D12 PUSH +43 359
#note Double Wow - my percentage chance of winning went from 9% to 74% in 2 turns!
>Jason_B.: EEEEINS 15C S.EENIE +30 352
#note Nice find by Jason with the drek that he has
>Allen: AIIOST 2A TA.O +18 377
#note Had a feeling he was going to try a desperation play - this would get me more points than with the leave from 7A OAST.
>Jason_B.: E 11B ..E. +17 369
>Jason_B.: E --  -17 352
>Allen: IIS J14 IS +15 392
#note Game Won, and I figure I have 2nd place.

But - Jim N and Sinna who were over 100 pts above me in spread tied!!  I win the tournament with a 4-2 record.
