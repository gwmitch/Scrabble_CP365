#note Didn't think of BARM instead, setting up the H. Quackle thinks it's a hair better than Elise does, but it's not a huge error either way.

#note This felt terrible as I played it, but I couldn't come up with anything better. There's a reason for that: There isn't anything better. (Though NOBLE instead is worth considering.)

#note Did not think to burn the blank here. mIZUNA 8J is best, according to the sims; I don't think I like it quite as much as they do, but I can see it. ANNU? isn't a super-powered leave, and the F isn't too dangerous. It's close.

#note Quackle suggests either this or JUT 15F; Elise wants me to burn the blank with JUDAs K3 (um, no), else take JUT or exchange. I'm still playing this.

#note Over the next several frames, you will get to see a clear demonstration of both my brilliance and my stupidity.

#note Attempted SHITE*, challenged off. It should be good!
>Michael: EEMY O11 .EEMY +33 346
#note Phony. I have no defense for this one.
>Mike: EEHIIST 14M HI. +16 266
#note Quackle likes EH 12L, HEIL B10, or TEIID H1. Elise suggests SEI 12K, but there's probably more mileage to be gotten out of the S.
>Michael: CEIW 8K .WICE +42 388
>Mike: EEIRSTW 12K SEW +38 304
#note Not sure what Quackle's choice of YEW 11K is trying to accomplish. I'm fine with switching course here; now I need these points, a bingo, and some good fortune (or a mistake) to steal this one.
>Michael: FIT M1 FIT +20 408
>Mike: AEINRTU 4A URANITE +73 377
#note RUINATE sims a hair better; I guess if I leave the Q in the bag, there's a chance I could stick him with it if he plays through the U and I block the other Q spot.
>Michael: DEEQU A1 QUE.ED +48 456
>Mike: CEGIOOV 3E VEG +25 402
#note CAVIE C3 is a point better.
