#note Going into this game, the scenario I mentioned two rounds ago has come to pass; I'm two games and 481 spread points behind Rafi, meaning I need to win these two games by a combined 241 points. That may or may not color my strategy going forward. On this rack, there is no bingo (although I probably wasted a couple of minutes looking), and anything that keeps a reasonably leave sims near the top.

#note Looking at the game in Quackle, it's pretty obvious there's no Q-stick available. Over the board, however, with the blank not marked with a T, it's not so obvious--to either of us. There are no wins here.
>Rafi: DENQS 3C D. +12 433
>Mike: AEIIPR 10N .I +6 373
#note Still no wins, and I'm not getting much closer. Even blocking QAt doesn't help.
>Rafi: ENQS 3L .EN. +18 451
>Mike: AEIPR C8 .I.E +8 381
#note Still nothing, although now I can get back within 29 (for all the good that does me).
>Rafi: QS 8M Q.. +11 462
#note "Oh, wait!" Rafi exclaimed as he finally noticed the spot, and we both had a good laugh. Props to him; he outplayed me in these two games, and basically outplayed everyone over the course of the tournament.
