#note Yup. That's where OVERAPT should have gone. This should cost me the game. Tell you what, if you found the spot for OVERAPT, give yourself an extra kudo point, because you outdid me.

#note #12 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown! Simple, yet effective, setting up VOTES or STOVE (forming SCUD). CUD is what the simulator Elise would play: that which gives the opponent the smallest room for error. Maddy has exactly one winning play at this point, also a common word. What is it? Answer on the next page.

#note Correct answer is ACNE B7, the only move that blocks both threats. There is an element of psychology to this position. I *did* see ACNE prior to CUD, but figured that it wasn't obvious, and there is a reasonable chance that my opponent might give up after a cursory examination, thinking "Why would he make this setup if it were blockable?"
