#note Second best. GLOWED 9C wins the sim.

>New_Player_1: EHHRSTW 9E THEW +23 47
#note Sim says leave off the T. But I don't think 4C and 0V is a great idea. 
>Quackle: ?CDILWZ 5J CW. +20 74
>New_Player_1: AHNORRS 6I SOA. +33 80
#note The leave is much worse than I thought. In retrospect, playing THREW last turn would have been better. This doens't make the top 10. 
>Quackle: ?ADIILZ 10F ID +19 93
>New_Player_1: HNNNRRY E9 .HY +25 105
#note Sim says to give up with this rack and exchange HNNNRY. But I think this is too many points. It's close though.
>Quackle: ?AILOUZ D11 AZO +29 122
>New_Player_1: NNNNPRR -NNNNPR +0 105
#note NR over R. Given the vowely pool, this makes sense. I'm ready for my next rack to be AAEEIOR.

#note UNRULIER. I figured there's no way I'd get a bingo with two Us in it.

#note I thought this board was pretty good for keeping a bunch of high scoring letters. I didn't like the risk involved with BOINK K14.

#note Again, I should give up on the bingo here. FINALE wins one third of the time. This wins less than 20%.
