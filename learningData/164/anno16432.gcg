#note A tough choice. I figured that given the score, I had to play volatile. After Q dumped vowels, I figure maybe he drew total crap so that he'll have to waste a turn to block the triple word score. Sim ranks this 2nd at about 21% to win. SHIVA wins 1% more often.

#note Not too good. 5A JET sims best but it seemed like too much of a waste of a good letter. It wins 18% of the time, this wins 12%
