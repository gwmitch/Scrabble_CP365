>Bryce: ?EGNNRU 8D GUNNERs +68 68#note This is cusswords game #4 for me, vs. Peter Armstrong, the highest rated player I've played in a tournament.  Quackle likes ENURiNG a touch better, but I am not sad.
>Peter: JU F6 JU. +26 26
>Bryce: DIIMOPR 6F .IMP +15 83#note Considered PIROG/PIROGI but decided on this, even with the beautiful Y hook.  This is only a little behind PIROG but way behind PRISMOID. 
>Peter: LMX G5 L.M. +16 42
>Bryce: DEEINOR 5I OE +6 89#note Third best behind 5G LO and I6 PORE.
>Peter: ANAGOES D3 ANAGO.ES +70 112
>Bryce: DEEINRU J8 .UE +4 93#note Considered EAU in either place, but I liked the opening this made.  E3 DUE is best.
>Peter: HEX E3 HEX +51 163
>Bryce: DEIIINR E10 IRID +12 105#note It seems EIR is a better leave than EIN, so NIDI is preferable.  QCP puts C2 ID on top but that looks ridiculous to me.  Hope he doesn't have the Q!
>Peter: QI D12 QI +47 210#note Doh.
>Bryce: ABEGINS 4I SABEING +81 186
>Peter: WLDERED M3 W.LDERED +80 290#note I held this for a bet but thankfully let it go.
>Bryce: AFLNNTY 8L F.AY +42 228#note Quackle advises me not to spend my blank and go with FLY at C1 or C3.
>Peter: VAC C13 VAC +30 320
>Bryce: EFLNNOT C3 NOT +31 259#note Speedy likes this the best, but Championship Player hates it, maybe because it doesn't open anything and I am down a lot.  C1 FON is on top.
>Peter: TOO K10 TOO +8 328
>Bryce: EFILNRS 7M .F +10 269#note I think, an E or O away from a 3x3!  Maybe he won't block it!
>Peter: TAO 15A TA.O +21 349
>Bryce: EILLNRS 10D ..LL +6 275#note Maybe should've just played one L at 14B, but I liked leaving the A8 lane open with this leave.
>Peter: OIDIA N10 OIDIA +21 370
>Bryce: ACEINRS 14H CESARI.N +62 337#note Better than SARCINAE since it prevents parallel plays (I assume...that was my reasoning at the time.)
>Peter: VIE H12 VI.E +39 409
>Bryce: EKRSTYZ 14B Z. +44 381#note I considered 2A ZEK but figured that was nuts.  It is in fact not nuts at all.  
>Peter: PU L12 PU. +18 427#note This looks like an "I have the blank" play.  It is.
>Bryce: EKRSTTY 9C Y. +9 390#note The only hope I thought I might have is SKITTER, and it's unlikely the blank is in there anyway.  Q likes 4B TONE, which is basically hoping the last two in the bag are A?.
>Peter: ?ABEHOR 3L O. +7 434
>Bryce: EKRSTTT B7 TSK +17 407#note I figured it would be hard to get to the triple easily since the word would have to end in two vowels.  I didn't know BOHEA.
>Peter: ?ABEHRW O1 WHi. +30 464
>Bryce: ERTT 2I TRET +9 416#note I am perfectly happy getting within 40 points of someone as good as Peter.
>Bryce:  (ABER) +12 428
