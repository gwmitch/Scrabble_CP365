#note this or D8 VIATIC, which is almost tied. i think i like taking the points better.

#note 5A DAG sims a little better, presumably because of the significantly better leave. (i have a much higher average score after dag, and a lower opp average score). i think i still like tragic, tho... (-1.5)

#note HIP C9 and 12N IF are better. for both HIP and IF my next score is significantly higher, which means FILES is a great leave with what i have, and looking at the pool it seem as if FELSITE/etc is the most likely thing to draw.  i guess it's a close call. i don't like fishing here when HIES catches me up. what do you all think. (-4.3)

#note with a many ply sim, my move is second to ROWAN, which i saw and considered for a long time. i really didn't like the OWE setup with the Y and P unseen, and couldn't figure out how best to block it. if i do FOWL and draw an ET (the most likely draw, although certainly the chances are still low) then i have a bingo. (-6)%  my fallacy is not keeping the F for scoring when scoring is essential now. my average score after ROWAN is higher than after FOWL because of the F.

#note and i throw away the endgame. THORIA, which i briefly saw but just passed up (apparently, since it didn't have an S i didn't recognize THORIAS AIRSHOT SHORTIA -- i recognized the words as 7s and not 6s) wins 100% of the time. i only had about 3 minutes at this point and spent a lot of it trying to figure out if 14B ARGON won, and figured out that if the E was the last tile in the bag, which is very likely, ARGON loses by one point. then i spent a while trying to figure out if i could fish off the R for ANORETIC and set up another bingo but couldn't figure anything out. finally, i looked back at the H, because i hadn't seen ANY play from it (and i needed to block HEAPY/PEAVY to win) and with a minute left i couldn't see anything better than HAINT and just gave up and hoped i could somehow pull out the endgame. THORIA DAMN IT!!!!
