>Sam: DDEELST 8G LED +8 8
#note I had a strong hunch that TED 8G would be better, but didn't follow through on it, disappointingly. Superleaves confirms that DELS is .28 better than DEST. However, the best play is actually Ex. D, which sims a point better than TED (and 3 better than LED). 
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AJP H5 JAP. +13 13
>Sam: ADENSST H5 ....D +15 23
#note JAPES H5 sims over two points better than JAPED, which surprises me. AENSST makes 2 more sevens and 37 more eights than ADENST. However, ADENST makes sevens with two more letters than AENSST, and its bingoes will score slightly more. Still don't really get it, though.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AEW 9F WA.E +17 30
>Sam: AENOSST 5H .OTS +22 45
#note Considered OS I5 13, but didn't think that the T was worth 9 points to the leave. I was wrong. OS sims about 2.5 points better than JOTS. JATO and JOTA 5H are also very good choices.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: NW I4 N.W +11 41
>Sam: AAEENSS J4 E.A +15 60
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: IQS 3G QIS +31 72
>Sam: AEHNOSS H1 AH. +18 78
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: AEGHIO 10A HOAGIE +21 93
>Sam: ENNNOSS A7 NOS. +21 99
#note Saw NONES 11C, but wasn't entirely sure of it. It sims basically equal with NOSH. 
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: OOTY B4 TOYO +17 110
>Sam: EEINNST 11E TENNIES +88 187
#note Held this one for a while.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: ACUV C9 V.CUA +28 138

>Jeffrey_Jacobson: EZ -  +0 138
#note Challenge
>Sam: ?CDIKNU N1 DUCKINg +92 340
>Sam: ?CDIKNU --  -92 248
#note I thought after the successive long hold and challenge I could get away with a phony. Not a good idea.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: EZ J10 Z.E +32 170
>Sam: ?CDIKNU 4B .UCK +20 268
#note DUCI A1, which I considered, looks better. Shouldn't have needed to get rid of the K so much.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: FLO 12A FO.L +22 192
>Sam: ?DEGINR A12 .RIG +24 292
#note Wow, this is humiliating. I even specifically looked for eights down from the E. ENERGIDs, ENGIRDEd, and ENGIRDlE all play. I remember getting caught up in only looking for -ING bingos, which is very intermediate. A mistake I hadn't made in a long time.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: MV C3 V.M +20 212
>Sam: ?DEINOR 13H ROsINED +78 370
#note Looked for a while, but didn't see GuERIDON 15A 80. To be honest, I wasn't even sure it was good. 
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: ?AGILTU M6 LIGATUr. +60 272
>Sam: DEEFIOR 8K FO.IE +30 400
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: RR M1 .RR +6 278
>Sam: AABDERY E2 BA.ERY +30 430
#note Did not know the anagram pair of BAYADERE/BAYADEER at all. That would have been sweet. This is a bad play even of the non-bingos, RAKED E2 is best.
>Jeffrey_Jacobson: BEIPTUX H13 .EX +30 308
>Sam: AD 2J AD +12 442
#note AD 14L is three more points, but I didn't know LIGATURED.
>Sam:  (BIPTU) +18 460
