>Steve_Knapp: AEIRZ 8D ZAIRE +48 48
>Jason: EEGLLRS E5 LEG.L +12 12
#note Correctly passed on GELLERS, but missed (A)LLEGERS!
>Steve_Knapp: LNWY 6D N.WLY +19 67
#note "I've decided to try something new," said Steve, who'd been drawing copious amounts of vowels (and one of 14 blanks) all day. "So this is how the other half lives."
>Jason: ?EFIORS 9H FORtIES +66 78
#note 66 is all I can get with this rack? Yes.
>Steve_Knapp: ADL 8M DAL +17 84
>Jason: EENOUWX 7M OWE +20 98
#note Debated between this and EXEUN(t), the two clearly best plays. Speedy likes this by a tick.
>Steve_Knapp: AAEERST 5H AERATES +69 153
#note Dammit! EXEUN(t) would've blocked this!
>Jason: ENNORUX K9 .UX +18 116
>Steve_Knapp: EOTT 10F TOTE +14 167
>Jason: EEINNOR 4J ONE +14 130
>Steve_Knapp: AEKM 3J KAME +35 202
>Jason: DEGIINR 4F DIG +16 146
#note "That looked painful," Steve said. Indeed, I felt like I had to open, but this doesn't do much good except for -ES bingos. (But Speedy's pick of (X)I does nothing.) Am I banking on drawing one of the unseen ?SS next turn? I did not fancy my comeback chances here.
>Steve_Knapp: IQ 11E QI +24 226
>Jason: ?EFINRS 12D FINgERS +84 230
#note ?S were the first two I looked at. I is luckbox.
>Steve_Knapp: ACEV 3C CAVE +21 247
>Jason: INOORUY L11 IRONY +33 263
#note This or YOU at 2M are the only plays.
>Steve_Knapp: ACU 15L .UCA +27 274
#note "I think I need to block that Y," he said. "Do I have to block that Y?" he asked me. (Yeah, he probably needed to block that Y.)
>Jason: INNOPTU 2F PUNT +24 287
#note Wait, NON(GAY) is good? Championship Player's pick.
>Steve_Knapp: BP D2 P.B +14 288
>Steve_Knapp: BP --  -14 274
#note Steve always plays upside-down ... I'm a little surprised this doesn't happen more often. Even if he plays it right, though; I'm probably going to win. "I get to put something in green!" I said. "I had four reds before this!"
>Jason: ADIINOV 1H OIDIA +29 316
>Steve_Knapp: BP D2 B.P +14 288
>Jason: ABDNOUV 13K V.DUN +18 334
#note Almost played B(O)UND before seeing this. Steve seemed surprised I knew it. Better yet is V(O)DOU, though.
>Steve_Knapp: T F10 ...T +4 292
>Jason: ABEHHJO 2M HAJ +31 365
#note A nice time for a EHHJ draw, especially since I overdrew after OIDIA and Steve threw the H back, which goes nicely at 10H.
>Steve_Knapp: GIMORST 14B TRIMS +25 317
>Jason: BEHO 10N HO +31 396
#note Whoa! HE at 6N, making (S)H(WAS)! Steve made sure I didn't have an out, then said "Oh, he doesn't know the fives in that!" I retorted with OBEAH and, after a pause, BOHEA. I know them because I didn't block them against Berofsky in Pontiac like I should've in a bollixed-up endgame. BOCHE, too, which I didn't know.
>Steve_Knapp: GO O2 .OG +13 330
#note A respectable 4-2, with a chance to tie for the lead at 5-2.
>Steve_Knapp:  (BE) +8 338
