#note HEW F4 is a marked improvement here, not sure why I didn't play it. WUSHU G6 is at least as good if not better than HEW, though, blocking the main hotspot and keeping a much better leave. There's also the chance Kay will try to put an S on WUSHU, as I once did. The only downside is that it opens up another X hotspot at F10 just as it closes down the one at F6.

#note Kay mentioned that she didn't really want to play this as she laid it down. JEwELING H5 67 would have been more defensive in that case.
>Sam: ?EHLTUU 1I .EHU +15 110
#note Quackle likes ULU 7A and LULU 5I slightly ahead of my play. ULU is interesting, and I might have played it, especially with all 9 As still unseen for a quick HAJ 1G.

#note Was so preoccupied with using up the triple that I didn't notice HOTTED N2. AHOY and HOTTED are in almost a dead heat, anyway (.3 equity)

#note Kay's fishy last play dissuaded me from some of Quackle's choices (POUTED L7, ROUPED D8, UPDO L6). However, OP B6 sims much better, and I should have seen and played it. FEU 5E also sims strongly, probably due to all the AEIR still out for sevens. DENOPT is stronger than it seems.

>Kay_Patterson: BEIMRT O6 TIMBER +36 255
#note I don't know Kay's seventh tile, but TIMBRE O6 or simply TIMBER O7 both seem a lot safer. 
>Sam: ADEIRUV 11J VARIE. +18 326
#note The fifteenth choice statically, but it rises to the top quickly upon simulation due to its defensive strength.

>Kay_Patterson: EOSV 10B VOES +33 308
#note This scores a bunch, and I don't know Kay's other tiles, but it seems to really reduce her chances of a comeback. 
>Sam: AADEGIT O13 DAG +26 361
#note Championship Player picks out ALAE 5H, which is nice, considering I keep the D for the DUKED hook next turn.
