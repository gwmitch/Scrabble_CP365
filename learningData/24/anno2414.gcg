>Chris: AEHIMSW 8F WHIM +24 24
#note 8H WHIM (not intuitive) -0.3 points (almost no difference)
>Jeremy: ADFLMOV 7E FOAM +25 25
#note 9E DOM, -3.7 points for FOAM
>Chris: ?AEINST J6 NASTIEr +73 97
#note 9E TEASING for 81 is best, -13.7 points. 2nd and 3rd are (MI)NISTAtE H7 and (MI)SEATINg
>Jeremy: DLNNVWY 11I W.NNY +22 47
#note 9C WYNN, -5.3 pts.
>Chris: ACCIIST I2 CACTI +12 109
#note 6B ICTIC for 36, -26.8 equity pts.
>Jeremy: AADLOPV 6E OVA +42 89
#note Best.  M9 PA(Y)LOAD and L9 VA(N)LOAD are in the top 5.
>Chris: EGIRSSV L6 SERVI.GS +76 185
#note Best.  Also the only bingo.
>Jeremy: ADEFILP M3 FELID +29 118
#note M6 IF for 20 keeps ADELP.  My play has a higher valuation by +0.8 equity points, but a lower win percentage of 10.03% compared to 10.61% for sacrificing next turn bingo volatility.  However there is still a blank tile unseen, so turnover isn't bad.  And interesting 2nd pick is DE(SERVINGS) at L4 for 30.
>Chris: BDORSTY L2 BOY +31 216
#note Best!  Too bad you can't keep a vowel with those nice consonants.
>Jeremy: AAIPPRZ N4 PAP +34 152
#note F5 A(VOW) keeping AIPPRZ.  Why?  For the win percentage.  I would need to draw an E and then I'd have ZAPPIER or APPRIZE.  The R at 13L is open for APPRIZER.  My play has a valuation of +4.9 more than the best play, but wins only 10.77% compared to 11.96%.
>Chris: DDENRST O1 DREST +34 250
#note O5 REDD for 27, -2.0 equity pts.  Quackle may be valuating the NST leave too highly on this somewhat closed board.
>Jeremy: AIRRRUZ 13L .URA +8 160
#note Exch RRU.  -10.8 equity points.  3F AUR(A)R is interesting as it sets up the Z.  My play is very aggressive and gives away too many points.
>Chris: DEENOUU O11 UN.U +5 255
#note The top play is a doozy to find.  12I  E(r)U(G)O for 18.  Chris' play is 2nd best in a 2 ply sim, but I bet Marlon Hill is tearing his hair out somewhere over this play.  Still -14.0 equity points.
>Jeremy: EEINRRZ D3 ZEIN +33 193
#note D4 ZIN spends less tiles and keeps EERR which looks worse, but it also doesn't put a Z beside a DWS.  I like volatility down 100 points, so I don't care.  My play has +1.1 more equity points than the best play.  ZIN is 6.12%.  My play is 5.91%.
>Chris: ADEEIOO 3C A.IDO +32 287
#note 3A DOO(Z)IE.  -6.7 equity points.  I can appreciate the fact that AZIDO gives me nothing to work with for bingo lines unless I have the blank, but Quackle doesn't see things like humans do.
>Jeremy: BEIOQRR 2E QI +29 222
#note Best.
>Chris: EEEEGOT I8 .EO. +15 302
#note 1F GEE is the only play with a positive valuation here.  -17.8 equity points.
>Jeremy: ABEKORR 1F KOB +35 257
#note 1F KOR keeps ABER for 6 less points than 1F KOB that keeps AERR.  My play is a better equity play by +0.2 again, but win percent is 9.09% to 9.54%
>Chris: EEEGOTT N1 OE +11 313
#note Exch. EEGOT. -2.9 points to best play.  Exch. EEGOTT is highest valuation, but slightly less win percent.
>Jeremy: ADEJRRU C2 J.R +12 269
#note 2 ply sim says 4A JAD(E). -5.7 equity points.  I like this play a lot.  It sets up a decoy for opponent to bit the A1 line and open up a bingo lane for me, or forces opponent to cover bingo line, at B4 but in the process probably gives me a better lane.  Quackle's "Many" ply help gives a wrong answer of H7 (MI)R.  That play depends on Chris opening with board willingly which he is simply not going to do unlike the simulations which just go for point grabs.
>Chris: EEGHNTT H7 ..G +10 323
#note 4G ET(C)H.  -11.0 equity points.
>Jeremy: ADELLRU B4 ALLURED +67 336
#note Best.
>Chris: EEHLNTT A8 EH +26 349
#note Sim set to Many ply now with >15 in the bag.  A1 LETHE scores 49 and is best.  -17.0 equity.  Win percent with LETHE is 44.93%.  A3 EH is just 13.93%.  Not only is scoring important now, but getting to that last blank and X with a huge hot spot on the board.
>Jeremy: ?EGIORT 15I GOITREs +86 422
#note GOITREs or GOITERs wins 100%.  Best.  Both have same valuation.
>Chris: AELNTTX -  +0 349
#note C8 AXEL.  -68.0 equity points for the challenge, but if it's the only way to win, a good choice.
>Jeremy: E K11 .E +5 427
#note Best.
>Jeremy:  (AELNTTX) +28 455
