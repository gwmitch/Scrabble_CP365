#note nice move. i spent a long time on my next move...
>Cesar: ABCIILZ B6 ILIA. +14 372
#note i think my move was decent. it doesn't show up in the kibitzer, or even when i click ask championship player, but when i add it it's in second place (albeit a far second). 12J BILK seems to be the best move. is this correct? i know iliac keeps no vowels, but the bag is vowel heavy (11 out of 19) and his move suggests there might even be more vowels in the bag. plus if he didn't hit the bingo he might try to open another spot, and keeping the B for BI is helpful. however, a bingo could still fit. (-9)
