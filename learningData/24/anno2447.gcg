>Quackle: EIMRRTU 2B RUM +20 289
#note 8a I(L)EUM is best.  RUM is second.   I'm not over thrilled about having two RR, but the 8a spot could do with being killed.

>Quackle: BEIIRST 2M BI +12 301
#note (FROW)STIER for 42 is best. .  That word probably won't be that useful in the future, but FROWSTY may be.  This was a bit of a gamble - I liked to play with some volatility as I know have several lines to play off - Quackle doesn't hate this play, but it also has a habit of being over aggressive.
