>Evans: EIOQRUW D10 ROQUE +32 56
#note I always forget that keeping the Q isn't that bad when I keep a U and other vowels with it. This play is a fairly big mistake. DOW 9E, keeping a strong leave of QUIRE, seems best. -9
>Jesse: BEILNSU 15D SUBLINE +96 112
>Evans: AEEEHIW 14H HEW +37 93
#note I got a little too hung up on taking the points here... this play scores most but sims well behind plays like AWEE and EWE that hold onto a consonant. -7
>Jesse: EFGKORS 13I FORKS +48 160
>Evans: AEIIVYY 14M IVY +20 113
#note YAY 7G is really that much better?! It scores nicely, but EIIV is garbage, isn't it? A baffling -13.
>Jesse: ??EEGMT O7 GEoMETr. +89 249
>Evans: AAEEEIY -AAEEIY +0 113
#note Thoughts? The sim favors AYE N10, but down this much, I'm desperate to draw a bingo rather than keep AEEI and gamble. Quackle says -6. Thoughts?

>Evans: DEIMORT F8 .OM +25 138
>Jesse: AEEGLOR K8 GAOLE. +14 285
>Evans: ADEHIRT N5 DEARTH +41 179
#note Sims about even with EARTH... although Jesse argued later that there's no reason to waste the D here. I'm inclined to agree in hindsight.
>Jesse: AEINPRU 5G UNREPAI. +72 357
>Evans: CDINORR L10 DOR. +27 206
#note At this point I'm ignoring win percentage and just going by valuation... and oooh, DRINK in the same spot is a lot better. -7

#note Fishing for ENCINAS/SWAT or NASCENT/TWAT or something. I've basically lost interest in Quackle at this point, but my play's not that terrible.
