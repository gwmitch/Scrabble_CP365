>rodzilla: EELLNOS H8 .OLLEENS +74 74
#note Nice find by Rod. I played DEMOTIc because it would prevent most 7s without an S, but now I was regretting my choice.

>rodzilla: IX I9 XI +36 110
>wisemonkey: ABCGIOO J8 GOBO +34 137
#note I was going to play CAMBOGIA D6 until Rod played XI. I missed COBIA 9A, but GOBO sims best.

#note Just after I drew this rack, the hotel fire alarm went off. I thought about my rack as we were standing outside, but because I couldn't see it, I kept thinking of words that involved different letters. It wasn't until we sat back down at our games that I saw the obvious play.
>rodzilla: AEILRTU 5F URALITE +68 307
>wisemonkey: DEHKPTY 4A KYTHED +50 355
#note There are more than 10 plays here in various places that score over 40 points. I was overwhelmed by choices in every quadrant of the board. I found the second-best one, missing KEYPAD H1.
>rodzilla: IJOR H1 RIOJ. +60 367
>wisemonkey: ADEPRUZ 4L PREZ +58 413
#note I was vacillating between PREZ and ZERK, but PREZ sims much more strongly.

>rodzilla: EGNV B10 G.VEN +26 426
>wisemonkey: EFMNORT O1 FRO.E +51 503
#note Rod blocked FRONTMEN for 88! I didn't know FOMENTER, but FROZE is the best play anyway. Even if I had, I think I still would have chosen FROZE leaving one in the bag and killing QUIZ. Quackle says FROZE wins 96%, FOMENTER 91%.

>wisemonkey: AEMNRST --  -78 503
#note It never occurred to me that this might not be good. I thought a permeant was something that permeates. After Rod took it off, I figured it must be permeant, like perchance. It's actually just an adjective relating to permeation. Fortunately, I can't lose.
>rodzilla: GIIOS D11 .IG +12 472
>wisemonkey: AEMNRST 15A ASTERN +31 534
#note Best is STRIA J2, blocking DIOLS.
