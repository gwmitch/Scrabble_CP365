>Mitchell_Brook: AEIRU 8D AUREI +12 12
#note URAEI 8H would have been safer for him.
>Sam: ADEFLUZ 7G FAZED +43 43
#note Holding onto the D with FAZE 7G is better.
>Mitchell_Brook: CIINRT 9H NITRIC +15 27
>Sam: CDELUVY L8 V.CED +30 73
>Mitchell_Brook: OPW 6J WOP +32 59
>Sam: ALOSUWY 5K YOW +36 109
#note Quackle likes WAY 5I by a point, don't believe I saw it.
>Mitchell_Brook: JO M3 JO. +26 85
>Sam: AAILSUU N5 LUAU +16 125
#note This is really risky, but I think it's a necessary risk. I have to exchange otherwise, and it's 16 points. 
>Mitchell_Brook: INX O8 NIX +36 121
>Sam: AABEINS K11 BAA +21 146

>Mitchell_Brook: ?DEEIRT 12A InTE.RED +72 203
>Sam: BEGKPSU B10 BU.KS +32 260
#note Did I really not see PUKES O1? Or did I really forego it for this? Accidentally scored as 30 instead of 32.
>Mitchell_Brook: HLMMOSY 4L H. +26 229
>Sam: ?AAEEGP N10 AGAPE +31 291
#note Again, risky, but I liked it. Also hoped that Mitch wouldn't know the back hook, which he didn't. PEA A8 is another good option.
>Mitchell_Brook: AGGN O12 GANG +35 264
>Sam: ?ELMNOO D4 MOOL. +20 311
#note Didn't see the bingoes: LONgSOME and LONESOMe 5A. Didn't know the former, but someone told me the latter and its anagram once. 
>Mitchell_Brook: ELLSY O1 YELLS +38 302
>Sam: ?ADENRT 1H ARDENTl. +86 397
#note Would surely have played pEDANTRY 1H had I seen or known it.
>Mitchell_Brook: EFINORT F8 .IF +29 331
#note No play gives him any winning chances. This blocked the only Q-spot, though he didn't realize it at the time.
>Sam: EEHMOQT 2H MEET +21 418
#note Not a terrific play...TEE 2H is best, 16 whole points ahead of this according to Champ. Player.
>Mitchell_Brook: EINORST 13A S.IN +24 355
#note REE 11D is best here, with COR M9 not far behind.
>Sam: HOQ J9 .HO +19 437
>Mitchell_Brook: EORT C1 ROTE +12 367
#note Slow-playing me works out better for him...THORITE J9 is best.
