>Steve_Krieger: INZ 9C ZIN +24 24
#note Steve really does make some nice plays. Remember seeing him find SAMOVAR at MM ... and earlier in the tourney, against George, he played a nine (looks like WAtERLI(NE) and trip-tripped with SIGMOIDS for 167, which George was obligated to challenge.
>Jason: AAOOORS -AOOO +0 14
>Steve_Krieger: AHNTU 7G HAUNT +24 48
>Jason: ADLORRS 10B RAD +20 34
#note Championship Player likes ARDOR at 8K. Steve said the first thing even remotely critical of me after this game ... didn't seem to like this play given the hook potential.
>Steve_Krieger: ELORTW A8 WROTE +32 80
#note Put down TROWEL, then picked it up. He got 33; I got 27 'cause I forgot to score ORAD. When we agreed on 32, I said "hit me" and Jeff Clark reached across the table and pretended to hit me. "Oh, I thought you were invoking the Brian Galebach Rule!" he said. We then explained it to a puzzled Steve.
>Jason: ELNORSS I5 SO.L +12 46
#note Didn't know LORN(N)ESS. I hate, hate, HATE plays like this; Steve even said "Well, that tells me something." I feel the equity loss from holding onto the second S is less than telegraphing part of your leave.
>Steve_Krieger: ACILMU 5G MU.ICAL +22 102
>Jason: AEEGNRS M3 EN.ARGES +72 118
#note MUSICALE is good! I doubted it.
>Steve_Krieger: LOX 4F LOX +39 141
>Jason: FFGIJOO 10J JOG. +28 146
#note Championship player likes JIG(S) instead ... kinda unorthodox, but I see why.
>Steve_Krieger: ?DEEILY 3A YIELdED +84 225
>Jason: EEFFIOU A1 FE. +27 173
#note Might've overthought this; tried to stop a repeat of round 11; created an opening ... not a great one, but an opening. But FOE at 11I is fine.
>Steve_Krieger: EINPT B2 T.EPIN +24 249
>Jason: EEFIOSU 11I FOE +25 198
>Steve_Krieger: AKP 4L K.AP +38 287
>Jason: EHIOSUW O1 WHU. +36 234
#note Championship Player gives WHI(P) the edge by a tick. Must be because of the four I's out.
>Steve_Krieger: DI 8M .ID +15 302
>Jason: EIOORSV 6M .VO +14 248
>Steve_Krieger: EIR C9 ..IRE +28 330
>Jason: BBEIORS J10 ..B +12 260
#note Bit of a goofy fish; but three A's for ISOBARE, three T's for ORBIEST, a D for DISROBE. 3 to 1 shot at a playable bingo. But BI(L)BO at D1's clearly better.
>Steve_Krieger: AN 12H NA. +11 341
>Jason: BEIMORS 13G MOB +26 286
#note Championship Player likes MOBS for 14 more ... must want to pin my hopes on drawing the blank/outrunning.
>Steve_Krieger: ?AINQRT 14F QATs +47 388
#note Perhaps surprisingly, Championship Player likes playing for the bingo and playing Q(I) at 6A. Guess it makes sense, if I bingo then he goes 7-on-7 with the blank in a close game. If I fish (which I would), he'll almost certainly bingo.
>Jason: AEIORST -  +0 286
#note Yeah, there are potential wins if I solder on, but I felt obligated to challenge even though I was pretty sure FABS was good. Even if I play O(H) to get within 92, fishing for the N for RETSINA at 15B, given that Steve can play GRID to kill the spot and go up 117, and get stuck with at most 22, I don't have a 95-point out bingo.
>Steve_Krieger: DGIR 15D GRID +25 413
>Jason: AEIORST D3 .IRA +8 294
>Steve_Krieger: CEINSTY F8 .EINY +26 439
#note (D)ICTY is one better ... I can C-stick him otherwise, I think.
>Jason: EOST F2 T.. +5 299
#note Another Division-13 level endgame. I thought this was his only C play.
>Steve_Krieger: CST 13B S.CT +6 445
