>Jason: HIIMRVX 8G MIX +24 24
>Brian_Bowman: EO 7H OE +15 15
#note Brian sat down with a McDonald's Sausage McMuffin (or whatever it was) and asked if he could eat it during play, a la Viloria to Graham in NYC. Winter then commented: "You couldn't pay me to eat that!" (Since when did he become Morgan Spurlock?)
>Jason: HHIILRV 6I VIRL +22 46
>Brian_Bowman: DDEEILN K6 .EDLINED +70 85
>Jason: HHIKMOW L12 HOWK +51 97
>Brian_Bowman: EFR 15L .ERF +33 118
>Jason: AEHIMNZ N10 ZANIE. +70 167
#note Like against Krieger, no equity loss in the first four turns. But watch me make up for it at the end.
>Brian_Bowman: AGOT O7 TOGA +26 144
>Jason: AHMNRRU J12 HUM +27 194
#note And the lousiness begins. If I'd known MURRHA, I play it at N2 and who knows how different things are? I knew this play was ballsy with both blanks and all four S's out ... too ballsy. Speedy's second pick, but Championship Player knocks it down to ninth. Even HA for 28 at J10 (leaving MNRRU) is better.
>Brian_Bowman: ?ACNSTU 15D CoNATUS +92 236
#note Yes, it's going to get away from me in a hurry.
>Jason: AEENORR 8E RE...E. +17 211
#note This or (VEX)ER.
>Brian_Bowman: EIILW E3 WILIE. +18 254
>Jason: AENOPRY D2 YAP +29 240
#note Missed (W)EAPONRY. Then missed a whole scad of better plays by chickening out on P(REMIXED).
>Brian_Bowman: ABDEGIR N1 BRIGADE +82 336
>Jason: EEENNOR C1 EON +23 263
#note ENRO(B)E at 1J is slightly better, esp. given what's coming next.
>Brian_Bowman: AJU 1L JU.A +63 399
#note Uncle! "That's it, I'm eating my breakfast at the table every single first game of the day from now on!" I said. "And I'm 85% kidding on that."
>Jason: BEEINRV 1A BE. +15 278
#note Probably JIVE or JIBE, but I was in stubborn mode. Plus, my spread already stank, what was the harm in playing for a miracle win?
>Brian_Bowman: Q 10J Q. +31 430
>Jason: CEGINRV 6D V.CE +15 293
>Brian_Bowman: AFY M7 FAY +27 457
>Jason: GINOPRR B3 GORP +21 314
#note Yeah, stupid PREMIXED burns me again.
>Brian_Bowman: ?ADIOST A6 OuTSAID +81 538
#note Le sigh... "If it's any consolation, it tastes terrible," Brian said, pointing to his breakfast. "I could've told you that!" Winter said. Thanks for killing the joke, sir.
>Jason: INORSST 4H SORTIN.S +72 386
>Jason: INORSST --  -72 314
#note It was that I thought it was good. It's that I saw RIN(G)TOSS, which I knew, SORTIN(G)S and STORIN(G)S and, for a good five minutes, debated the merits of SORTIN(G)S vs. STORIN(G)S, going "RINGTOSS, SORTINGS? RINGTOSS, STORINGS? Just RINGTOSS? All three?" I looked at the A and I for literally two seconds, never saw (A)RSONIST or (I)RONISTS. As some point during that self-torture, esp. since I finished with 8+ minutes, I have to go "OK, do I have bingos I know?" Bad, bad mistake. 91-point spread hit.
>Brian_Bowman: ALNOTTU B11 TOLU +13 551
#note Correctly blocking, though Q says TOLA is one better, which I don't get.
>Jason: INORSST F1 TINS +20 334
#note Didn't know ONTI(C), the only better play. Ugh. On the bright side, at 6.5-2.5, -156 I'm still in shape to 1) maybe have the lowest spread of any tournament winner ever and 2) be the first person ever Gibsonized with a negative spread. To paraphrase John McCain: "And you will know my name!"
>Brian_Bowman: ANT C12 TAN +16 567
#note Counted as 17, the stinkeroo. :) As expected, a fablously played game from Brian.
>Brian_Bowman:  (ORS) +6 573
