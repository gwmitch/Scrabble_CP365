>the_mallard: FIIMSVX 8G FIX +26 26
>james: EENORRT H6 OR.ENTER +59 59
#note easy bingo find - i prefer OR(I)ENTER to REOR(I)ENT as to not lay the E in the double-double lane.
>the_mallard: CIMMOSV 12B MISMOV. +28 54
>james: EIIORWZ C9 ZOW.E +54 113
#note second easy decision in a row, nothing else is close.
>the_mallard: ABCHLNO B10 BA. +28 82
>james: ?IIOQRT I5 QI +13 126
#note one of those racks where dumping the QI and getting on with things is better than anything else
>the_mallard: ACHLNOO A6 LOCHAN +44 126
#note LOCHAN & CHOLA are the two options, the former scoring 9 extra points.
>james: ?GIORTU J8 TOURInG +77 203
#note I couldnt see any other bingos, but there are 2 fortunately worse than mine - B1 OUTGRIn & 11H (T)UTORInG..............an interesting word Q throws at me in the option list is GOMUTI.
>the_mallard: BDDELOS 15H DOSED +35 161
>james: EEEJLOW L11 JEWE. +32 235
#note my first mistep.  the definite spot is to the -D down column L.  I played JEWED, though there is a better play -   JEWELE(D). The latter has a 3% better win percentage than the other three.  4 equity points lost.
>the_mallard: BEGKLPP F10 BL.G +13 174
>james: AEILNOU 5I .UOIN +28 263
#note 5I - (Q)UINOA is the prize play.
>the_mallard: EFKNOPP L1 KOPP.E +38 212
#note well, i've never seen that word before, another way of spelling KOPJE apparently.
>james: AAAELNT 1L .ATA +24 287
#note i went for (K)ATA over (K)ANA purely as there was one extra T over N's.  Q says that the better two plays are still thru the K -  A(K)ELA & AL(K)ANE.  -1%.
>the_mallard: ?EFINRR B1 REFRaIN +78 290
>james: AEEGHLN A1 EH +26 313
#note K10 HA scores 10 more but i wanted to block the A1 spot and leave AEGLN over EEGLN.  It has a 66% win compared to my 62%. This could be due to there being four unseen AAAA............ ......Also, Q prefers EH being placed at M13 over A1 by 4% also - i'm not too sure why. It scores 1 point fewer and isn't that defensive. Perhaps Q likes to be open and aggressive with my quite balanced rack.
>the_mallard: DIIRSTT 3I DRI.T +20 310
>james: AAEGILN K10 NA +26 339
#note Q really prefers to just fish off an A in one of 9 places. The best of these is 11J (R)A(J).  This move is 14% win ratio better than my NA in the same spot.   It's hard to know why -  am i so much more likely to bingo by fishing?  Is ridding the N from my GELIA rack making it that much worse than GELINA on this board.... can i really find enough spots for an -ING bingo?
>the_mallard: AEISSTU N5 SAU +20 330
>james: ACEEGIL 8L GALE +25 364
#note best - i wish i had that N now, but the SAU-L hook was lucky.
>the_mallard: AEINSTV M8 .VIATE +49 379
#note a nice play worth emptying the bag for. It and AVIATES are 31% better than the next best play M10 VANE for 37.
>james: CEILTUY N13 TYE +18 382
#note a bizarre moment - I only focused on the N11 spot - SANDY is a great winning play for mr mallard - 39 points and an outplay.  I never looked elsewhere and TYE gives me (A)ULIC to go out at least.  Q suggests all sorts - C(R)UELTY, (F)LUTEY, (A)CUITY, (A)CETYL, (F)YCE, (F)LYTE, (F)LUYT, (F)LUTY.  All score >20 and none win as none block.  My play wasn't suggested, but it seems obvious and should win 100% of the time (but we know Q can get it sums wrong sometimes)
>the_mallard: ADNSY 4A D.Y +9 388
>james: CILU 2K L.CI +23 405
#note suddenly it's gone South.  the duck doesn't think i'm winning any more - all plays are 0% - this scores most, but i cant block all the outplays..
