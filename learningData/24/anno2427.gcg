>Sam: ADFIMOV L4 FOV.A +24 100
#note FOAM 6G looks a little better here.

>Sam: DLMNNNP G7 P.ND +11 148
#note Oh my god, this sims horribly. WTF didn't I exchange? Keeping DN or MN or anything is better.
>Mark_Berg: AERSTV 13I VASTER +35 180
>Sam: EEILMNN E5 MEL.NINE +90 238
>Sam: EEILMNN --  -90 148
#note Fucked up the numbers and erroneously thought this would be outside my range. Game-losing move.
>Mark_Berg: ILORT M9 LOIT.R +7 187

>Mark_Berg: GOTU F3 GOUT +15 202
>Sam: EEGIOOS 12K .I.E +16 200
#note Many similar plays, OGEE D2 is probably better.
>Mark_Berg: EX J13 .XE +26 228
>Sam: AEGIOOS I12 A.O +15 215
#note ISAGOGE 3C can't be better, I have to somewhat block, I think. 
>Mark_Berg: EF H14 FE +28 256
>Sam: BEGIIOS D10 BIOG +20 235
#note Q suggests going for turnover with GOBIES D1 or BIGGIES 3C. This was a big mistake.
>Mark_Berg: KNU 13D .UNK +14 270
#note Again I needed to go for turnover!!! NEWIES D1 is nice. 
>Sam: EEINSSW 15M SEW +25 260
#note Again, there are two blanks in the bag, and I need to play for turnover. NEWIES D1 would be superior. 
>Mark_Berg: OY N9 OY +28 298
>Sam: EINSUYZ 3C ZIN.Y +44 304
>Mark_Berg: AN 4C AN +19 317
>Sam: AAEIMSU N2 AMIA +17 321
#note Champ. Player barely prefers AMIA N4 for two more points. I thought leaving one tile in the bag was a better idea, but maybe not. I was also hoping he didn't know LAMIA.
>Mark_Berg: ??CDELR B4 CLEaReD +69 386
#note The two bingoes that win 100% of the time are DECRiaL B4 70 and RaDiCEL 1H 90. There are also a bunch of suggestions that yield 87.5% winning chances, and this might be one of them, but it doesn't show up on Champ's choices.
>Sam: EEIQRSU A9 RISQUE +29 350
>Mark_Berg: S 4A S... +7 393
#note PEHS I7 is 9, and BIOGS D10 and PENDS G7 are 8. He verbally considered RISQUES*.
