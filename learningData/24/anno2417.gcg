>Jeff_Clark: LUU H8 ULU +6 6
#note Knowing how much Jeff likes to hedge, and since we both had ratings-related goals (1750 for me, 1700 for him) with wins, at my suggestion, we agreed to split any prize money 50-50 . I liked it because I couldn't bear the thought of coming away with nothing from a 8.5-3.5 start ... which would've happened after this loss if I hadn't hedged. As it was, I got $125, half of Jeff's second-place $250.
>Jason: BCEGIOY 10F BO.GIE +17 17
#note A little frustrating that none of my consonants make twos with the U.
>Jeff_Clark: BEKNOSW 11B BEKNOWS +95 101
>Jeff_Clark: BEKNOSW --  -95 6
#note Like Linda's UNMOUNDS*, big score, ugly rack, ugly word. Kind of obligated.
>Jason: CCDELTY 11B CYCLED +35 52
#note Hopefully Chuck doesn't see this, a comment Jeff made as I put this down. :)
>Jeff_Clark: BEKNOSW B9 BE.KON +32 38
#note Ooh, nice. Didn't see that. "Can't leave that open," I said. "Why, what do you think I have?" Jeff joked. "I don't think, I know," I said. :)
>Jason: ADGNTTT A13 GAT +17 69
#note Stupidly put TAG down first. Q likes TATT(E)D.
>Jeff_Clark: AHSTW A7 THAW +39 77
>Jason: ?DNORTT K4 aTTORN.D +82 151
>Jeff_Clark: EISVV L1 VIVE +30 107
>Jason: AAEIINR 1K A.IAN +24 175
>Jeff_Clark: ESX L10 SEX +33 140
>Jason: AEILMRU 2N MU +18 193
#note Considered UM at M12 ... if I hadn't spaced on the -T back hook to SEX, I might've. Missed Q's pick of A(R)MURE at 8J.
>Jeff_Clark: DI C11 .ID +30 170
>Jason: AEIILQR B6 QI +33 226
#note "You know what they say," I said, "Play the U, draw the Q."
>Jeff_Clark: NOZ 7I ZO.N +23 193
>Jason: AAEILOR C6 ILEA +27 253
#note Earning a "nice play" from Jeff.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AOPSTW 13I POSTWAr +89 282
#note cOWPATS, same spot, is two more.
>Jason: AAAEEOR O12 A.EA +12 265
#note AAEI? Really? "I am officially tired of drawing vowels," I sighed.
>Jeff_Clark: EIOPRRS 14D PROSIER +71 353
#note Really?!?!?! "I am not tired of drawing bingos," Jeff said in response. I held, but it mostly a pouty/trying to see if I was obligated thing.
>Jason: AEIINOR 15F ION +19 284
#note All I could think of was "This is how 1750 gets ripped from my grasp? Pulling AAEE, IIN while he's pulling PROSIER from the bag?"
>Jeff_Clark: MY N12 M.Y +30 383
>Jason: AEEEIRR 8K .ARER +21 305
>Jeff_Clark: DFGORST F10 ..G +6 389
#note Fishing for the E.
>Jason: EEEFIJU N6 JE. +26 331
>Jeff_Clark: DFHORST D3 FROST +32 421
#note Q says FROTHS at D1 is 30 better. (E)D at 8C is 32 better, setting up the unblockable out of FROTHS. (Underscored by 2.)
>Jason: EEFILNU C2 FIE +24 355
#note I saw the right play; I didn't make it. LUNE at J2 blocks the out and guarantees I'm out first. Instead I went in the wrong order. I'd just totally lost focus at this point.
