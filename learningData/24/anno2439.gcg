>Carl: ENOORSU 7A ONEROUS +66 152
#note Why does the duck want me to play OUTSNORE A7? I greatly prefer ONEROUS. I'm up 62 on a closed board. Though Kenji is better then me on 9s, they're too improbable to be much of a threat.

>Carl: AGHLNUW 15L WAUL +47 229
#note Almost missed this play. It's easy to overlook plays that empty your rack of vowels or consonants.
>Kenji_M: ADIKM E2 MIKAD. +26 204
>Carl: ADGGHIN F3 DAG +17 246
#note Stuff like EDGING B9 or HIDING 3B win the sim. DAG is way down on the list, probably because of the dangerous parallel plays down column D. (As if OUTSNORE wasn't as dangerous! And EDGING allows a 100-point QUAG.)

#note Quackle wants me to burn the S here with SHINE O4.
>Kenji_M: ABLO D3 BOLA. +41 315

#note Or TRINING D9. It's close.

#note I would have been 100% on IMAGINgS, but I missed the only other bingo. The good news is that this is the last bingo I would miss for the rest of the tournament. Another interesting possibility here is A(BIDI)NG 3C.

#note With more time, I might have found R(E)E(C)hOED or ExODERM. I finished the game with just a couple seconds left.
