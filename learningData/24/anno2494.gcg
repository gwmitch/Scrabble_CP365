#note At least she held for a while... -24
>Cecilia: ALMT 8G MALT +12 12
>Evans: DEIKNUV 7H NEUK +16 16
#note Missing a whole bunch of things, the best of which seems to be DUKE 7F, although keeping the D and just playing UKE seems fine too. This play is a hideous -9.
>Cecilia: ATT 6H ATT +16 28
>Evans: ADGIRRV -DGIRV +0 16
#note Hmm. If I had seen VIRGA 9C, I might have played it, although it seems kinda lame to open the board for eights with a dinky little 19-point play. VIRGA sims way best, but I still kinda like my exchange, simply because it keeps the board closed and digs five times for all the unseen goodies in the bag. -14  (yikes)
>Cecilia: ?AEORSU L3 AROUSEs +73 101
#note Well, I guess she's bingoing anyway...
>Evans: AFIOPRY K2 OFAY +37 53
>Cecilia: CEHIOR M9 HEROIC +38 139
>Evans: ADGIOPR M1 PIG +26 79
#note PODAGRIC? Seriously? I gotta learn some words. -47
>Cecilia: AHIOV 11H HAVIO. +24 163

>Cecilia: EF N9 EF +31 209
>Evans: AEINOTV E11 OVINE +25 235
#note Ouch! I missed the (SHE)A hook. NATIVE is 51 points! This is a bad miss. -23
>Cecilia: BDIN O6 BIND +28 237
#note And now she gets the spot. This kills me.
>Evans: AENSTTW 12L W.T +22 257
#note TWO in the same spot is worth TWO more points...
>Cecilia: ACNY 14B CAN.Y +36 273
>Evans: AAEGNST D5 AGNATES +61 318
#note Not good. Missed the S hooks to form ANAS or SMALT. This is the worst of the three bingo lanes. -9
>Cecilia: IU 1M .IU +15 288
>Evans: BEEIJLL E2 JIBE +30 348
#note Again I must respectfully disagree with the duck. JEBEL sims best here, but why am I sticking a J in the TWS lane when she's losing and can easily pick up a pile of points with JEED or JOLE or something stupidly easy like that? A perplexing -7.
>Cecilia: EGLN 8A GLE.N +18 306
>Evans: DELLQRS C13 L. +4 352
#note I like this play. It blocks ZAX, un-doubles the L's, and leaves one in the bag. Quackle disagrees. Thoughts?
>Cecilia: OUZ 2H OUZ. +33 339
>Evans: ?DELQRS 3B SQu.RED +37 389
#note Close. Best is QIS 1F, leaving me an outplay of RILED/SOD next turn. -5
>Cecilia: EORTX B8 .OX +26 365
#note OXTER 9B scores 41! Tough find though.
>Evans: L 11D ..L +5 394
#note Missing OWL L11. -3
>Evans:  (ERT) +6 400
