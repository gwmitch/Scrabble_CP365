#note Speedy opposes the fish; says to play ZAS for 46 at J6.

#note Maybe I get a challenge from playing ERrATAS?

#note Linda counted it as 21 ... must've tripled instead of doubled. "Must've been wishful thinking," she said when I pointed out her mistake.
>Jason: ADELOTU B4 OUTDEAL. +63 190
>Jason: ADELOTU --  -63 127
#note Blanked ... thought it was OUTLEAD and OUTDEAL. Oops.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ETW F4 TEW +32 74
>Jason: ADELOTU 12A DALE +22 149
#note Equity hit, but I felt she was close. Wanted to turn over, score, and shut down lanes.

>Linda_Hoggatt: GIS A12 .IGS +18 92
>Jason: AAOORTV 4K OVA +17 190
#note Best to play the one that doesn't take the -S hook, given her last play.
>Linda_Hoggatt: DEEHIPS 3A DEEPISH +91 183
#note Bad, bad, bad. I need to hold, see I have ARiETTA off the H and a guaranteed bingo, and challenge it off. But I thought, after my bingo, I'm a bingo up with ??SSS gone and still in good shape, whereas it's closer to a toss-up if I challenge wrongly. Plus, I thought I'd seen this before.

#note Right spot, wrong word. R(E)NIG's Speedy's pick.

#note Two Q(I) spots, and I thought I was blocking the best bingo line. I would soon learn I wasn't.
>Linda_Hoggatt: EEGLNOS K7 LONGEES +77 365
>Linda_Hoggatt: EEGLNOS --  -77 288
#note Could've let it go; QI at N2 is a win. But 1) I didn't notice until after the challenge and 2) I was 99+% sure this was bad.

>Linda_Hoggatt: EEGLNOS K9 OGLES +23 311
#note Plays at O3 are best ... blocks my only big play.

>Linda_Hoggatt: EN 14A .EN +14 325
#note I pointed out that if she had a 14-point play, it'd be 444-333. Then she found it and we laughed about it, then Jeff asked about lunch plans. As they talked, I said "You mind making it official? You still haven't hit your clock yet!" :)
