#note It took me a while to find this spot, which scores better than anywhere else on the board.  But once I found it I rushed the play.  I should have played FEVER instead, even though it would have actually turned out worse, since I picked up the other Y immediately.

#note Sim likes more than a dozen plays better than this one.  None of them impress me all that much, and some of them look downright stupid.  Perhaps MORAY E2 is a bit better defensively than my play, but it's the only play Quackle suggests that I might make in place of this one.

#note This sims very poorly, but I can't figure out why.  VALONIA I6 is a nice play I did not see, but otherwise I don't have many good options.  Although Quackle likes several exchanges here, it just doesn't make any sense to me to play like that at this score.  I've got a slight lead and bingos are unlikely, so I want to keep the game moving as quickly as possible.  My play also sets up a spot for OAF B2.

#note I took a long time on this play, and it's a really important moment.  At first ZOWIE seemed like a good idea, not only because it scored well, but because he was likely to score off the Z if I didn't.  But a look at the remaining tile pool convinced me that it was too dangerous to stick an E out in the N column.  In particular I thought of RETINITE, which is exactly what he would have had.  However, I underestimated his chances of bingoing from 15H.  I probably should have played OF 14J to block that lane.  Although it allows him to fish one tile to open the N column, my rack is versatile enough that I should be able to block easily.  Also, I'm in good shape in the non-bingo endgames because I have more scoring tiles.  Championship player thinks the top three plays by winning percentage are DEAF 11K 87%, OF 84%, and APOD 77%.
