>Jason: EIILRRT 8G LIRI +8 8
#note Didn't think LITER was strong enough to sacrifice 8 points.  Sim seems to like it all right.
>Bing: BDIKNRV J6 BR.NK +27 27
>Jason: EEOQRTZ K3 ZERO +30 38
#note I would have played BORTZ had I seen it, but it sims close to ZEE and ZERO.  Surprisingly (to me), h7 QI *cleans up* on the sim by 10 points!  I'll have to do some thinking on this. [-10]
>Bing: DDEGILV 4H VEG.D +28 55
#note I had resolved in this game to hold anything I didn't know before accepting it rather than just trusting my much more knowledgeable opponent.  My 5s are not that good but I was pretty sure that I would have had to have seen this, and eventually I got up the stones to challenge bing.  I saw this as a turning point in the game not because of its impact on the board, but rather on my psychology.
>Bing: DDEGILV --  -28 27
#note Umm, I guess this wasn't such a smart move. It might be a little better than DEVILED 4F, if I could get away with it. Nice challenge.
>Jason: AEIOQTV L2 QAT +39 77
#note I placed QAT for 39 and then definitely noticed that given he has DEGV on his rack, an A gave him GAVE/ZAG/ETA and an I gave him VIG.  At the time I decided to roll the dice, because I'm going to need a little luck to win this one, but if I had it to do again I might have chosen something else.   For what it's worth QAT wins the sim, probably just on the strength of scoring so much, but anything that allows the opp to play VG for 50ish must be regarded as at least a red flag.
>Bing: DDEGILV M1 VIG +51 78
#note Lucky to survive the faux pas.
>Jason: EINOUVX 1M .EX +39 116
#note Uh... I have no idea what happened here.  What a strange move.  I think I only considered the E, I, and U. :)  [-6]
>Bing: ADDEELR H4 DERA.LED +62 140
>Jason: IINNOUV G1 UNION +11 127
#note Just plain didn't see VINO at G3 for 18.  My move is pretty indifferent.  I didn't want to get paralyzed by overthinking  and wasting too much time debating amongst my poor options (a common problem for me), but this was a weak move.  [-8]
>Bing: DEGINPS 2A SPENDI.G +78 218
>Jason: ILMNOOV 10D MOVI. +18 145
#note VIOLO(NE) is nice here.  I just wanted to get rid of the damned V and undouble the Os while keeping things  open.  A smallish mistake.  [-3]
>Bing: AAAGOUY D8 GA.AY +26 244
>Jason: ?HHLNOW C11 HOWL +30 175
#note Yeah, NOHOW is better.  I wanted to try and get back in it with a triple S hook, and leave things wide open, but those 10 points would be nicer.  [-8]  Not exactly world class play so far, eh?
>Bing: ADEFOTU 8A FUD.E +30 274
#note Slightly annoying that FADEOUT wouldn't play, but things were still looking great for me. That would quickly change.
>Jason: ?BEHINO A8 .IsHBONE +104 279
#note At least I saw this quickly, getting back in the mix.  Was planning to play SHINBONE had FUDGE not been played.
>Bing: AAEIORT A1 O.TIA +18 292
>Jason: AEEJOSU 11J SAJOU +36 315
#note Scores the most, has the most equity, is volatile.  All things I want :)  I'd do it again.
>Bing: ACERTUY L11 .URY +28 320
#note Another nongo, CAUTERY. I didn't think EUCARYOT# would have much of a chance.
>Jason: ?AAEEOS D1 A.OA +10 325
#note AE(R)O wins 4% more.  I didn't see it.  I looked at AREA or AREAE there but thought that was too easy to score 42 for him, so probably prematurely rejected the spot. [-6]
>Bing: ACENRTW E8 .N.W +34 354
>Jason: ?EEISST 15C SESTInE +82 407
#note I was 90% on SAJOUS and was determined not to lose the game on a stupid hook when the scores for the two different spots were so close.  It does sim a couple of points of equity and a couple of %ge points worse than simply hooking SAJOUS.  But the real key here was drawing the case S.  [-2]
>Bing: ACEFRTT N10 C.RET +26 380
#note Best sequence. As long as Jason didn't fall off his chair, the torch would be passed.
>Jason: CEELMPT C1 T.MPLE +34 441
#note I spent 9 of my remaining 12 minutes finding this.  I completely retracked, forced myself to look for every place where FAT could play, checked the score, tried to see if there were any tricks at all.  I thought about C(R)E(E)P for a long time, then hit upon PELT, then TEMP, then finally found the right idea.  I didn't want to be the goat with so much time on my clock and $1000 at stake.
>Bing: AFT O13 FAT +25 405
#note So that's it.  Nothing spectacular from me--just somewhat lucky, a couple of largish mistakes and quite a few little ones.  It was a good game from a competitive perspective and I enjoyed it.  Hats off to Dave for a great game despite being outdrawn on the power tiles.
