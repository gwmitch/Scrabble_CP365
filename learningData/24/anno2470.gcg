#note The Quack favors 2J DEvOIR 28, 2J GIvER 26, 2I GROvED 26 and 9E ROADEo 24 here. My play does score less, but 1) I see it as less dangerous and 2) I think my leave on this play is better than any of the leaves from the others. Thoughts?

#note Quackers likes K5 OBELI 30 or K5 OH 23 better. I disagree.

#note Mine's way down. Apparently anything 11I ending in S/SHEWN is better than exchanging. I yet again do not understand.

#note This is one of several endgames I can honestly look at and say I blew. I had 1 minute on my clock, so I went with playing LITERATIM/EMeU and thus blew the endgame. I have an easy win here, and I'm sure I would have found it with more time.
