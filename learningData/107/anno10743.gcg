#note I held this for a long time, but I didn't think a 1400 player would just throw down some bullshit on someone much higer rated than them, so I figured she's seen it before or something. MISCITES is the valid bingo here. 
>Matt_Canik: AEIILOZ N13 AI. +16 271
#note I elect to play here first because on this board, that looks like the spot where she could score the most, and I'm absolutely willing to take her on on a closed board.

#note I know the R hook is scary, but this play is just so much better than the others that I'm willing to take the risk. 
>Debbie_Scholz: NU 15A UN +8 306
>Matt_Canik: ADILPPU 15D PAD +28 360
#note Given that she just took almost 5 minutes and then played this, I'm assuming she has the blank. The 2 line is really the only place she can bingo, but AI blocking that just doesn't make sense right now. This puts me up by so much that I can still outrun her bingo. PUD(D)L(E) scores 32 and looks to be better, but I didn't see it. 
>Debbie_Scholz: FIRT D8 FRIT. +21 327
>Matt_Canik: EILNOPU N1 OI +16 376
#note So looking at the two lanes, I see a lot more possibilities that play in the 2 row than the E column. I've gotta try blocking one and shouldn't empty the bag. A many-ply sim where I've specified a blank on her rack says OU(D) wins 65% of the time, and this comes second at 61%. I don't really understand what OUD does at all, except hold EILNP so I can maybe bingo back, but I just don't think that seems right.
