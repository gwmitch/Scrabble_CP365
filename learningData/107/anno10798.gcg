#note I played this over JOUNCE/JAUNCE to avoid giving the huge hotspot at F2. Also I'd rather keep AEN than a single vowel.

#note this sucks, I have no good way to take advantage of either red square and I'm blocking off possible bingo lines. Best play though.

#note I felt I just couldn't leave this spot open with QXZ out. I could play NIT, but I realized I didn't need to bingo to win. Quackle likes leaving the area open with O12 METE, which I think is a bit insane.

#note second best to F12 OX, which is a move I don't understand. LEZ allows me a chance at least for AXON/EXON E2 or for AX C12.
