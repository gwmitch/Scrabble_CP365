#note Yeah that was a great find by Shaun.
>Geoff: ACIIRSU 9G A.URIC +13 263
>Shaun: ?AINRRT 14F ReTRAIN +67 287
#note Lowest on champs ordering of bingos. He was worried of playing TARRINg, which be put down, because of the unseen F's that I might have FOOL, FEOD, etc.
>Geoff: FIILRSU 15K FURLS +35 298
#note Didn't get the E for FUSILIER. FURLS is significantly lower than FUSIL, which I did not see.
>Shaun: ADEHMOR 5J HOARD +32 319
>Geoff: EIIOOVW 13E VOW +25 323
#note No way could I do Champs choices of WIVE or WOVE -- if he FETA or META, I'm toast.
>Shaun: EEFM O11 FEME. +11 330
>Geoff: EEIIOPU N11 OPE +18 341
>Shaun: AGINP M12 AG +23 353
#note He playing PACING at least once, maybe twice and was considering that. I saw him gesturing at the I on ANURIC, and thought he was worried about NIXE -- he said he was worried about IXIA, even. Had he played PACING I would have likely played AXIL, though I never got the chance to think things through really for that hypothetical.
>Geoff: EIILNUX K8 N.XIE +24 365
#note Champ gives EXING an 18.75 win% and DUI a 12.50 win% NIXIE has 0.
>Shaun: EEIJMNP B1 JEEIN. +28 381
#note We went over this in postmortem. Shaun plays JEEING here, which loses the game (he missed DULIA under time pressure). On further reflection, he liked JEED, which is one of 6 wins. If played correctly, JEED and then PIE for 18 wins by 1 point.
