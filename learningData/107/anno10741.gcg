#note I was quite confused after he played BITT, it's like he just made the play I was going to make.

#note Ugh. I knew PLAG(U)Y too. 
>Winter: ADEEGRS M4 DRAGEES +72 181
>Matt_Canik: AIIJLRV 8L V.IL +33 200
#note I'm not sure if I want to play JIVY and leave the 8L spot open for him. 
>Winter: ??ELLOV 4F VOLLEye. +72 253
#note Really? hOVeLLE(D) is 78 but aggressive.
>Matt_Canik: AAEIJRR H1 JAR. +33 233
#note So concerned about breaking up the doubles that I didn't think about JAIL. Bad oversight. 
>Winter: AGN 3G G.AN +18 271
>Matt_Canik: AEIINRS 7H .I +8 241
#note I strongly consider NI(P)A because I don't want to get caught up fishing here, but that kills the 9 line, which is probably my best shot at a bing here. The sim likes the fish, but the sim sucks at closed boards. 
>Winter: HLNOU 11C UNHOL. +24 295
#note I play one tile and you open it up?
>Matt_Canik: AAEINRS 10F NA. +12 253
#note I wasn't paying attention to V:C ratio here, but 17 of 30 unseen are vowels. Probably should have done something different, like maybe 9G AD or something. The sim wants me to play AI 12D, but I just think that's stupid, I shouldn't kill my best line. I played NAG because if he hits his F or H there, I'm suddenly down 80. But given V:C ratio, I think this isn't too smart.

>Matt_Canik: AEIRSST G3 ..A +4 276
#note I really should have played AS instead of A. I need the extra points, but I wanted to be dead sure that I had a bingo instead of picking up more vowels or a WU or something. The lane is unblockable, which is tight. 
>Winter: EER C13 ERE +12 370
>Matt_Canik: EINRSST 5G .S +14 290
#note I bingo with 8/9 unseen tiles, and if I bingo out and he draws the W maybe I'll win? He's got 2 less points somehow.
