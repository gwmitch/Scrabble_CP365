#note bad move, I figured there were many Es left, but even so FORA is significantly better.

#note this is a surprisingly interesting move. I didn't see anything that good, but CWM at 4B keeping ACLNT wins the sim by a lot. there are only 7 8s with ACLNPT?? but the pool happens to be anomalously vowel-heavy, which means I'll hit stuff like PENTACLE, PLACENTA, PLATONIC, PLATINIC and PLANCHET surprisingly often. talcum also has the negative side-effect of setting up an X spot.

#note this is the key move of the game, and I am pretty sure my choice lost me the game. If I don't block the P now he has a bingo percentage of 40% versus 20% or so after EEK. In addition, EEK sets up SOX/EX for 35. However, I thought there was some chance that his bingo might give me an X play. If I play EEK and he bingoes I lose for sure. Finally, I have to dump the Q at some point anyway and it doesn't look like there will end up being a better spot - I may even end up getting stuck. quackle gets this one wrong because it doesn't play the rest of the plays right, so I don't know how these plays really stack up. My ultimate logic was that I had to unblock the rack by dumping the Q at some point, and I might as well do that now before he has the chance to create more lanes. But now I think that the EEK-SOX combo gave me a better chance to win.
>James_Porter: ?IMNORY 2H .NORMItY +78 388
#note if I'd played EEK he would be in a tough spot - he could play MOPY at 1F to block the X play and would then be very likely to draw an out-bingo that I couldn't block without eating the Q.

>James_Porter: EHOT 1K EH +22 410
#note his best play is actually EH at L1 to set up HIT/TOT.
