#note I thought I needed to keep the I open or he would play some dumb blocking play at row 14 and I wouldn't bingo. a sim kind of bears this out - if you give him a rack like HAJ that leads to good blocks on row 14 my bingo percentage drops precipitously.

#note that's the case E - I considered burning my last S but turned it down. quackle's favorite is actually RECUTS which I didn't really know was good.

#note he laid down CRAP and switched it to TAPIR.

#note I actually have a pretty good chance of winning now. no play looks especially great.  I kind of like taking away the easy play from the C.

#note kinda screwed, might as well create another lane

#note aaargh. wayne makes this play instantly...
>JD: ?INOSSW 6B WINS +25 296
#note and I miss my gamewinning outbingo. I had about 30 seconds, went through the vowels and then decided I couldn't see anything right away. I can even go over by a lot and find it and still win. I thought I might have a chance to win even without bingoing if wayne screwed up and therefore didn't want to go over - but it's tough to balance that with exhausting all the bingo possibilities under heavy time pressure. what a shame.
