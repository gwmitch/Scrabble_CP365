>Matt_Canik: BFOSSTW 12I WOST +28 61
#note This should be SWOB, which I just don't see for whatever reason. STOW sets up a nice S spot, but I think that gets blocked very very often. 
>Ricky_Sirois: UV G6 VU. +8 56
>Matt_Canik: ABFGNOS 9E FOG +20 81
#note F(R)OG scores two more with the same leave, I just got excited about the hook he opened up.

>Matt_Canik: ?AAGRST 4F cARTAG.S +59 233
#note SAGA(CITY) holding RT? for 42, but since I didn't know that and didn't see GASTR(U)lA(E), I played this. 
>Ricky_Sirois: AM 3L .AM +28 215
#note I didn't think this was a B setup, he would have just played JAMB methinks. 
>Matt_Canik: DIILOTT 3G TOIL +16 249
#note I didn't see anything else that made sense. DO(E)/(A)D(ZED) is 30, static prefers holding DIL with TOIL but given that no Ls have been played and I am holding the last Ts, this could be better. 
>Ricky_Sirois: ANV 2M VAN +26 241
>Matt_Canik: CDEIIOT 2D CITED +17 266
#note I think about ZORI for a while, then decide without the L or S it's not worth it. TI 1N makes it hard for him to play, but he's always got a free 17+ in that spot. I wanted to set up DOR->ODOR with this play.
>Ricky_Sirois: IO 1H OI +21 262
>Matt_Canik: AAEIORS D2 .IAO +12 278
#note wasn't crazy about this, but wasn't crazy about anything here. IO(T)A L10 seems like a better play, but I just didn't see it. Also, I don't see EXPOS->EXPOSE all game. (It ends up costing me the endgame)
>Ricky_Sirois: AEKL C3 KALE +32 294
>Matt_Canik: AEFNRSU B6 FUN +27 305
#note (FERA)CITY. I really considered playing FUR instead because it's got a much lesser chance to be overlapped. I remember looking at tracking and seeing two Ns left and no Rs, but I guess I saw wrong. 
>Ricky_Sirois: IMNU A7 MUNI +28 322
>Matt_Canik: AELLORS 14E REALL. +19 324
#note I realized today that I have no idea how to play a preendgame. This looked like a decent choice to me, I had two places to play the Q if I drew it, and I think I can go out before him if he plays the Q in SUQ, QIs/sKI, or anywhere else. 
>Ricky_Sirois: ?BIIQRU B1 QIs +28 350
>Matt_Canik: ENOS M12 SONE +16 340
>Matt_Canik: ENOS --  -16 324
#note I didn't see NEONS/EXPOSE, which is the only valid winning out. SONE loses by 1 (he has two points less on his score), so I have to try this. 
>Ricky_Sirois: BIRU 15G BI +23 373
>Matt_Canik: ENOS 10K .EN +5 329
>Ricky_Sirois: RU O1 U. +6 379
>Matt_Canik: OS N10 SO +12 341
#note So my clock didn't beep and I felt like I played this game well within my time, but somehow I ended up three minutes over and lost an extra 30 points. I was using one of those red fliptimers and I found out later in the tournament that those don't always change when you push the button, so I'm assuming that's what happened. (He had like 12 minutes left too iirc)

Overall, I think I played this game fairly well, a couple silly mistakes and then the endgame whiff really hurt, and then all those CITY extensions that I didn't know definitely hurt too.
