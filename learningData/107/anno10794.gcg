#note fatal is just asking for a stackwar, and with CM on my rack, I think I will come out of one of those ahead. Quack wants me to play FACT 9H or FLAM 7E.

#note I am tempted to set up (N)ERVINES for NERVINESS, which I bet he'd miss and I see. But he has an S and I don't know if he'll see it or not, so I don't gamble here.

#note Geoff and Doug have finished their game and I can overhear them talking at this point. If Geoff won, I could not win the tournament. If Doug won, I need to win by 75 more than he won by. From their conversation, it sounded like Geoff won, so I just quit trying and set up an easy out-in-2. I didn't look for plays of his, so I miss NEXUS/GIROS. As it turns our, Doug won by just a little, and the spread I lose on this turn really haunts me- I lost out on 1st by 3 spread points.
