#note ELK at 8H is better, because I have the S and it doesn't take any other hooks, unlike LEK.  (-3.5) unfortunately, my word knowledge is as always, pretty spotty, so i wasn't sure if ELK took an S or LEK took an S.

#note JISM is probably pretty close but i wasn't sure of LEKS again.

#note i figured it was better to play it safe and take 4 less points. how lame. (-4)

#note he missed PHENACiTE. sheesh! 
>cesar: AEELQUZ H10 .LAQUE +54 184
#note (-0.5) CALQUE. it probably doesn't matter, but what makes it slightly better? quackle says i score more after it. maybe it's because there are 6 As unseen and only 1 L unseen, so i'm more likely to have a good play through 12H with the L there.

#note huge, massive screw up. i was close to 100% on PRIORY, but i wasn't worried about that spot. after his last few moves the big bingo spot looks to be down column L. if i block it then i can kill the last lane afterwards, but i guess he would open up on row 3 or something like that. yes i know there are plenty of F starting bingos but i wanted to take a shot. in a tourney i hope i would play BOY/PRIORY. i hope i would do that anyway. note to self: don't try weird things at club. (-25)

>cesar: ABEIRTT 4I A.BIT +28 368
#note after that worst-case scenario you'd think i'd be tempted to play something like D12 TRET and grit my way through victory, but luckily i've learned a little bit of the scrabble.
>nick: APY 11K PYA +28 364
>cesar: AENRTTV 10L AVER +26 394
#note heh. i had about 4 minutes left and i believe nick had about 1 minute, and there were people gathering all around us and a loud recount going on next to us. if the boisterous LA club scene doesn't make us immune to noise i don't know what does. in any case, this was one of those times where i have no idea what to do. overall 3L TAV looks like the best play, and championship player picks it (41.67% win), with mine in 2nd place at 36.11%. I'm not sure if quackle plays out the endgames properly, but when we were looking at this play afterwards i thought he'd seal the game if i did TAV and he had the S and blank. now that i look at it, it's actually not that easy to score all that big off of TAV. the main advantage of it is seems to be the probability that i go out; i don't see how else to win after TAV. the main reason i played AVER is because absent any other indication i'll go for the points, and secondly because he had a minute left. (-5.5%)

#note WOLVeR/S are the only winning play, he was set to do D12 SMeW and then changed it to this at the last second and went over
>cesar: ANOTT 15G T.N +3 397
#note kind of freaked out here; G14 NO is a little better, and i went over time too! (-3)
