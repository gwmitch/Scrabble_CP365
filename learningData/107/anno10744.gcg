#note I inexplicably miss SPAVIN/OGHAMS and PAVINS/OGHAMS. I see PINATAS and PAV(A)N. Generally, I would play PAVAN, but the tournament had a NASPA membership renewal for the top two NASPA words, so I played this. OGHAMIST is a good extension, which is strange because OGAMIST*. Exchange V is an interesting option that I didn't consider at all. 
Overall, I lose 9 points of equity on this play but earned a $30 NASPA membership. I think $30 > 9 points, don't you?

#note RACLETT(E) is an 8 I didn't know. He set this down, moved it and set CLATTERY down, then came back and played this.

#note I really think about exchanging here to try to pick up the blanks, but decide against it because there's nowhere to play them.

>Matt_Canik: AEIIRTU -AIIU +0 292
#note I trade 4 for the extra shot at the blanks. He's not playing like he has either one. 
>Neil_DeWitte: UUUU -UUUU +0 324
#note He says on this exchange, he draws 3 Is. 
>Matt_Canik: ELORTTU 4D OUTREL. +22 314
>Matt_Canik: ELORTTU --  -22 292
#note Since he only exchanges 4, I think that maybe he does have a blank already. Makes me very hesitant to play this, but I do. I'm convinced that this is a word. Neil has shown shaky word knowledge in prior games this tournament too, so I was surprised he challenged it. 
>Neil_DeWitte: III -II +0 324
#note He told me he exchanged II and drew ??. FML. 
>Matt_Canik: ELORTTU 4D LOTTER. +22 314
#note I want to exchange again, but I can't- that would be the 5th consecutive 0, he could just pass and win. I miss UTTERLY for no good reason.

#note I'm now incredibly low on time. A many ply sim gives this and only this a chance of winning (~6%). I've just gotta hope I pull a miracle out of the bag.
