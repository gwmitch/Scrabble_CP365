#note I felt really good about how I'd played up to this point. this one is a close call - I'm not sure why I decided to take the points but I didn't want to get in a fishing battle with robin. I figured my chances would be best served by taking the points and trying to gum up the board down the road.

#note this is a pretty tough tradeoff - I can play TWIN/WE and collect 11 extra points and try to outrun and potential bingo, or I can go for some kind of partial block. I wasn't thinking so much about the D, but really there are no dangerous spots besides that - the TSADE hook is low-prob, and a bingo on row 2 is likely to give me a lot of points. that said, if I play TWIN I will have a really good chance at outrunning her too. close call, but I'm ok with my decision here.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: EFL M11 .LF +12 320
#note I was a bit worried about X plays, so it relieved me that she blocked this spot. without a short high-scoring play this turn I figured she wouldn't be able to catch me.
>JD: IINOOPP 12K PO.IO +26 387
#note as robin said after the game, "wow, polio was a godsend". I actually had a better play that I didn't see - PEPINO keeps some vowels in preparation for what should be a consonant-heavy pool.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: ?EINRSX 4F .EXtRINS +98 418
#note damnit! I think she had to draw an X bingo to win (after signalling that she didn't have it last turn). I don't get ELF - there are other places to play the X but this is potentially a high-scoring one and she should want the volatility.
>JD: AFINPRR O1 INFAR. +30 417
#note man! she totally didn't have the X before so she must've drawn it and then bingoed with it. I'm not really sure if there's any other bingo that gives her a chance to win. she also drew an outplay. this is a bit worse than infra at 14A if she sees HAET.
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel: AHT J2 HA.T +15 433
>Robin_Pollock-Daniel:  (PR) +8 441
#note It wouldn't have taken much different for me to go 8-0, but this was still a really good first day.
