#note jesse duel! it sucks to make a game-losing play on the opening play. He took a couple of minutes to play it, I knew BREGMA, BREGMATA and BREGMATE, and I wasn't sure about BREGMAS*. that should've been a big red flag, but after staring at it for about two minutes I let it go. stupid!

#note the math on bregmas: I'm now 17% to win the game, says quackle (those numbers tend to be more accurate early in the game), versus about 44% if I challenge it off and exchange. I may be better than that if I assume he's going to play bregma and hold a z on the exchange, and also my general knowledge of his rack may help me in the long run. on a side note, quackle prefers WREN - I thought about WREN to keep the S open but PRAWN seemed to lead to a more open board.

#note he almost played cupper (which I might have challenged unsuccessfully) and then switched to this.

#note with how good the pool looks, keeping a longer leave with DUNK bingoes twice as much (jumping from 25% to 50%). with the two blanks out it's tempting to turn it over more, but on the big open board it's worth taking a shot at the bingo.
