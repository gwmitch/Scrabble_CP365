#note I used up basically all of my time here - this was the best shot I could come up with. maybe just BIG at C11 is better.
>David_Whitley: NRT C5 R.NT +5 387
#note this is exactly the kind of play I was hoping he would make with very limited numbers of consonants in the bag. he had to do it too, since I had HIDINGS (not that I had spotted it yet)
>JD: ?DGHIIS C10 GHIS +28 403
#note worse than JIHADS by 1 - I didn't see FINALE. I think my best hope is that he misses FINALE and OLEFIN.
>David_Whitley: ?EFLN 1A FiN.LE +24 411
#note I thought I was going to win right up until he spotted this play.
