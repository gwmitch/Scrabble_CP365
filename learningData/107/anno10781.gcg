>Siri_Tillekeratne: EIOPRR 8G ROPIER +18 18
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEESY -AAAEY +0 0
#note I guess AYE for 15 is probably ok, but I hate keeping doubled As.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AHRV K5 HAV.R +22 40
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHOSSU J5 UH +31 31
#note I liked this, makes it really hard to score anything without an S, and I have 2 already.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABG 7F GAB +14 54
>Matthew_Larocque: EFIOSST 10E SOFTIES +76 107
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BEN 9D NEB +11 65
>Matthew_Larocque: CEMOQTW 8A COME +30 137
#note Oh hey, COWME(N).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DEINT H10 .INTED +24 89
#note I'll just spoil this now - this is the highest scoring play Siri makes for the entire game.
>Matthew_Larocque: IKOQTWZ B6 ZO. +32 169
#note Sure, WOK looks worth it, I don't mind hanging onto a Z.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AY 6G YA +16 105
#note He changed to this after orignally playing AY over to the left.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIKQTW 13F QA. +13 182
#note Time to chuck the Q and take out some bingo lines.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: CIN 6B .INC +15 120
>Matthew_Larocque: AIKPTTW 14E KIT. +25 207
#note Harder to score down in the corner than if I had played WIT(E).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EILO D2 OLEI. +10 130
>Matthew_Larocque: ALPTWW C2 WAW +32 239
#note I don't know what my last letter was, but this was surely the best move.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IIUUU -IIUUU +0 130
>Matthew_Larocque: DILPTUV 15B PULI +13 252
#note Board is pretty ugly, maybe I should have just messed up the N or the D. I just figured this was one of the only places left to score.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EX 9K .EX +20 150
#note Why not (V)EX for the T hook?
>Matthew_Larocque: DEJRTTV J10 .VERT +10 262
#note Killing the N and the D.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: NNRU 2A UN..RN +22 172
>Matthew_Larocque: DDJLSTU A1 J.T +30 292

>Siri_Tillekeratne: FI 10M IF +22 212
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEMOS O6 DAMOSEl +83 399
#note Also saw MASOnED which I wasn't nearly 100% on. It has two anagrams that score much better than this play, and MEADOwS does the trick all the same. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EGILRS 1H .InGLERS +80 292
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EGILRS --  -80 212
#note Siri doesn't have any bingos..... harsh, man!
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGNOT N1 GOATEE +23 422
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EGILRS 13L GELS +20 232
#note He missed all kinds of good plays with (EVERT)S.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAN B6 ...N +13 435
#note At this point we assumed the game was over..... and only saw afterwards that we forgot about two letters still in the bag!
#note -10 on my clock so it ended up 429 - 230. Rough stuff, Siri!
