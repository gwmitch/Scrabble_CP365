#note CORIVAL# -- of course when mentioned to that CORRIVAL is good after the game, I wouldn't have thought it meant the same thing.

#note Needed an A for DRAWLIER. LOWRIDER nearly plays, if the entire board is up one row.

#note I thought he was fishing, so I was wary of slotting that S there. But champ likes it best. He held but ultimately released. SERIALISE is also acceptable in TWL, surprisingly. Would you play ZAIRES/JOULES and not risk the potential trip-trip and block all the open triple lanes that can be bingoed on?

#note TONETICS. Had see it recently, but didn't see anything when looking at the rack. Was fishing for the I anyway.

#note Low on time and still found the best play -- beautiful play as well.
