>JD: ADEEINU 8H ADIEU +14 14
#note I beat mike by 353 earlier in the tournament for my only win in my first 8 games. after winning narrowly against kevin lee twice in a row getting to play mike again was my reward.
>Mike_Ryan: EELNORT I6 RE.OLENT +62 62
>JD: AEGGNOR H1 GRANGE +29 43
>Mike_Ryan: IVY H13 IVY +29 91
>JD: ADHOPTW 11E POTH.AD +52 95
#note for some reason I chickened out of towhead. I guess this was almost as many points. but the P is better on a wide open board to bingo with (25% keeping a P, 13% keeping a W).
>Mike_Ryan: ADEERSU 4G U.DERSEA +68 159
>JD: EILSTWZ F10 Z.WIE +39 134
#note I stared at this rack for ages trying to choose between ZOWIE and fishing the W (EILSTZ hits lots of huge bingos on this board). At this point it hadn't occurred to me to put an S on UNDERSEA yet. If I saw it, ZITS/UNDERSEAS would be best.
>Mike_Ryan: CIOU K2 CU.IO +14 173
>JD: BGILSST O1 GIBS +35 169
#note I thought I was phonying him, but this is good.
>Mike_Ryan: AP G9 PA. +19 192
>JD: DELRSTX M3 T.LEX +40 209
>Mike_Ryan: LOT K11 .OLT +5 197
>JD: ADFRSSU N6 FUD +37 246
#note I thought about tacking on the S but it seemed like there were a lot of useful spots for them. however, FUDS also limits his scoring potential on column O, which makes it worthwhile.
>Mike_Ryan: ?EEELRT 2A RELEtTE. +68 265
#note I just about challenged this until I parsed the word correctly (not one who relets)
>JD: AAIRSSW 1A AWA +31 277
>Mike_Ryan: EFNOT O8 OFTEN +36 301
>JD: IIIIRSS N10 IRIS +14 291
#note the odds of this particular draw were 1/3276. quackle wants me to just take the points with SRI.
>Mike_Ryan: AKNO M12 KOAN +27 328
#note I'm screwed...right?
>JD: IIJOQSY 2N Q. +22 313
>Mike_Ryan: CHO D2 .CHO +18 346
#note this was kind of painful to watch. he almost played CHOW/PO and then just seemed to be looking for any place to play the same tiles...it's hard for me not to think that any other play that keeps the board closed (OCA, NOH) wouldn't win him the game. even with this play I'm still a huge underdog.
>JD: BIIJOSY C5 JIB +24 337
#note as it turns out, I had mistracked and thought he had no vowels (I had him tracked to MMNNRRV?). However, I think I still ended up with a good play. championship player's numbers aren't working too well (its favorite play of YOB at E5 only wins one endgame in reality. in practice I like my play because I would expect to win 4/8 endgames - drawing the A, the N or the blank. If he didn't actually have a vowel as I expectedl he would be in all sorts of trouble, but even so he's under a lot of pressure.
>Mike_Ryan: ?AMMNRV B6 MAViN +31 377
#note he has a couple of winning plays but this is not one of them. he has to block my out and then be able to outrun NOSY. the only plays that do this according to quackle are MeM/MeN followed by VAW. this is a trap!
>JD: INOSY E5 YONIS +42 379
#note phew.
