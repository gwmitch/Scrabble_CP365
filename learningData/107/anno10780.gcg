>Matthew_Larocque: LOPPSUU H4 POPULUS +78 78
>Matthew_Larocque: LOPPSUU --  -78 0
#note I threw this down really fast and missed the real bingo..... sometimes I just want to see how people react.
>Noella_Ward: IJN 8G JIN +20 20
>Matthew_Larocque: LOPPSUU 7H PUPU +16 16
#note PULPOUS still plays.
>Noella_Ward: DEILOT F3 TOILED +21 41
#note Hmm... wonder what the 7th letter was?
>Matthew_Larocque: HILOSSU 8K HILUS +32 48
#note Forgot if it was HILUS or HILUM, but it's this.
>Noella_Ward: AEGIY 3B GAIE.Y +28 69
#note I really hate this word, always think it ends in ITY. I held for quite awhile.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEOOST G8 .O +10 58
#note Time to study bingos with doubled Os? And maybe OE is better than this.
>Noella_Ward: ADEERUV M4 REVA.UED +64 133
#note Ok, so my logic is I've got tons of bingos now, and I wasn't 100% on this so I took the hit to check it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACEOST -  +0 58
>Noella_Ward: AAERW 10F AWARE +25 158

#note Oops, HOAXE(R) instead.
>Noella_Ward: MO 12K MO +30 213
>Matthew_Larocque: AABIKNS E5 KAB +36 228
#note I don't exactly study obscure words with this low of a probability.
>Noella_Ward: DFI 14H DIF +33 246
#note Well that was ballsy.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFINQS 4I FAQI. +34 262
#note Ouch. I assumed there was nothing down on the bottom row, but I whiffed the awesome 90 point FAQIrS. I'm bracing for the worst having left that ridiculous spot open.....
>Noella_Ward: CENT 15G CENT +39 285
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENRSTW N2 WEST +34 296
#note Wtf, how can I not figure out WeSTERN(S).
>Noella_Ward: GV D2 V.G +14 299
>Matthew_Larocque: ?INORTY 5J TI +28 324
#note I'm kinda low on time - threw this down for easy points and hoped I'd score a bingo that won't take a long time to see. This does better than (G)YraTION in the sim though.
>Noella_Ward: RRRR -RRRR +0 299
#note Was glad when she did this - nows my time to pull ahead!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENORY B2 A.ONY +34 358
#note Again, I figured there was bingos, but I was in a rush so I was pretty sure I could outrun her with this play. Of note though - (CENT)ENARY!
>Noella_Ward: BINT A6 BINT +25 324
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEENRR 5E ..R +7 365
#note She played BIN, then changed her mind. Then she played this instead. I grabbed the blank slip and wrote down U, planning the play ENDuRER. D'oh, TE isn't a word! Well, now she knows it aint in the bag lol.
>Noella_Ward: ILLR 9A .RILL +6 330
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEENNR O1 RED +20 385
#note I even thought PREVALUED might be good, but totally forgot about it at this point. I couldn't be sure anyways. I was already at -10 from the time so I had to play something fast.
>Noella_Ward: EORZ D11 .ROZE +34 364
>Noella_Ward:  (?ENN) +6 370
#note We did a recount, I gained 1 point, and I very nearly botched this one.
