#note this is definitely interesting and i spent >5 minutes on this. i saw the Q plays, AUDIT, CUTIE. TUI was actually the last thing i spotted when i had already spent too long and i slapped it down. what i liked about it vs. cutie is that it kept the CE for COENZYME. that's about it. i wonder if that's why it sims higher... QUIT/QUIET/QUAI just don't seem correct to me. why play those? AUDIT is definitely better than TUI though, so i should have done the thing where i write down plays and compare them... next time. finally, DUCI and DUI are also ok. quackle sometimes is insane though, so QUIT sims best. (-6)

#note better to be lucky than good. sidecar sims best because of the X most likely! (big-ass row 3 plays) i shoulda looked at the bag more closely. i was dumbly concerned about an S hook that's not that easy to hit. (-1)

#note i was too chicken to play ALANDS because not completely sure. M11 AND and O5 LARDS are significantly better. (-34) (really, that much equity? blah)
