#note 7D OF is fine... why did i play this? (-9) my game totally breaks down against certain people! david whitley had beaten me already once, and now that we're playing for the tournament my only objective is to win the game (i'm a game ahead), so i think what i'm doing here is trying to devolatilize the game. it turns out that FORETOP will score less points afterwards than most of the other moves, but its standard deviation is lowest, so in some dumb way i succeeded? 9F FOOT is also fine, or 7B COOF, or 9H OF. none of those seemed right to me, i didn't want to fish with what i thought wasn't THAT strong of a leave, but the pure equity part of my game tells me those have to be right.

#note (-3) OKE is fine too. i didn't like the ACGI leave, but i wasn't really trying to be defensive. i think i had some misguided turnover thing this game.

#note although i blocked this

#note -2 ABRI. amazingly by this point i have like 14 minutes left on my clock. yes, i spent like 11 minutes on those first three lame moves!

>cesar: ?AEIINR 10E .RINEmIA +59 134
#note i spent so long looking for a 3-3, and was playing so slowly overall that after this i was down to like 11 minutes vs over 20 for him. i spotted urinemia quickly, but i spent so long looking for something else thru the N that i FORGOT i had spotted something, until i looked again and found it, and didn't even look at the K or G for more than like a second. i don't understand what i was doing here. (-11.5)

>cesar: ADDELOP 12I PO.ADED +30 164
#note too desperate, APOD keeps a better leave at L12. although, i don't like what that does to the board. (-5) in any case, my screwups the past few turns make my win chance super low.

#note the bag bailed me out a couple of times, but now i have like 5 minutes on my clock and there's basically no way to steal this game. anyone think of anything?
