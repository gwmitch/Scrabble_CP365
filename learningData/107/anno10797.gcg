>Wendy_McGrath: EIJV 8E JIVE +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: BCGOOTW 9C COOT +20 20
#note I was sure Quackle would hate this, I mean BGW is pretty awful no matter how you slice it. There doesn't seem to be any standout plays that I missed though.... so whatever.
>Wendy_McGrath: EW 10D WE +20 48
#note Quite the dangerous play there, Wendy.
>Matthew_Larocque: BGILOSW 11A BOWLS +48 68
#note 48 for this clunk? Cool beans.
>Wendy_McGrath: GNRU A11 .RUNG +27 75
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGINTU I7 TrUEING +75 143
#note 3 bingos play for 77 - at H8, H1, and 15A. This sims about equal though.
>Wendy_McGrath: ERT F6 TR..E +17 92
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AGIIKS J6 KIS +34 177
>Wendy_McGrath: AABL K4 BAAL +21 113
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AFGIIY L4 YA +26 203
#note I couldn't decide on all the plays I had here. I figured something like FAY L2 or L3 was just giving her easy counter plays. I didn't know IG(N)IFY. So I kind of liked YA because it didn't give her much to work with. I must have missed YAGI though, cause I kinda like that now that I see it.
>Wendy_McGrath: CEIORX 6B XERO.IC +32 145
#note Wendy just loves her long JQXZ words.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFGIIU 7B IF +27 230
#note Q also likes FIGU(R)E. Can't really argue, it dumps the U that's holding me back.
>Wendy_McGrath: ADP A7 DAP +25 170
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGIMOU 13I .OUGE +14 244
#note I took a long time on this play, too. Didn't see (KA)GU. If I know GONIA, shouldn't I know GONIUM too? With the second blank I wanted to open aggressively.
>Wendy_McGrath: FRTZ 11G FR.TZ +34 204
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IMNOTU H1 MUONI. +33 277
#note I didn't spend much time looking for potentional bingos once I saw this play. I figured it would probably be just about as good as bingoing, and chances are I wouldn't know the bingos anyways.  GUMpTION for 80 beats this, but M(U)TINOUs is slightly behind it.
>Wendy_McGrath: ILNOPSS 2G P.LSIONS +74 278
#note Held, but figured I could outrun this play even if it wasn't good.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEENOT 1L TOEA +22 299
#note Again, if I know NEONATAL, why wouldn't I know NEONATES? Because my Scrabble vocab has absolutely no rhyme or reason.
>Wendy_McGrath: Q 5G Q. +22 300
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEMNRY 5C RAY +30 329
#note ANYMoRE for 96. I'm basically rushing at this point - I saw RAY for 30 and just played it because I figured it was "good enough". I hate the letter Y, so I'm usually better off ditching it and drawing an easier bingo >_>
>Wendy_McGrath: ADE C9 .A.ED +29 329
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEIMN N7 ErMINED +70 399
#note Wow I got so frustrated here. One of those racks where there should be a million bingos to chose from and I can't find crap. I saw this bingo pretty fast but I wasn't 100% it would fly, so I tried to find alternatives. DENIMED and SIDEMEN are the only other words that play, and I couldn't come up with them. So, with falling into time trouble I had no choice but to get a bingo now. Hence I threw down ErMINED and she quickly challenged.
>Wendy_McGrath: AEHLNRV -  +0 329
#note Sweet!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHIT O7 HEAD +39 438
#note Q likes HA(r)T or HA(r)D. Prolly cause I let her score 37 next turn.
>Wendy_McGrath: AEHLNRV M7 HEAL +37 366
>Matthew_Larocque: IT G11 .IT +7 445
#note 14J for 10.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (NRV) +12 457
#note -20 points off of my score. I didn't exactly play like a near-expert here (or anywhere else in this tournament for that matter) but somehow I managed to improve my rating anyways. I must be lucky as hell or something.
