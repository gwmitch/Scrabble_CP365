#note If she had an S, I'm very certain she would have played down N2. So I deduce she didn't have an S when she played this, and she confirmed that suspicion after the game. 
>Matt_Canik: ?DEILTT 5M .T +2 371
#note Since we're assuming she didn't have an S, that meant two of the 3 tiles in the bag when she drew were esses. That means there'a a 66% chance I pull one now. If I do, I have T(E)L(E)vISED 15G 80 as an outbingo. To make sure she doesn't play ENIGMA there, I've got to give her somewhere else to play. Pretty much any play she makes there won't outrun me except SIGMA, which I don't really expect her to see. So I think there's a 66% chance this wins. 
 
AT also appears to be a solid play, but if she plays GAMINS N1, she can outrun any and all possible bingos. 
>Fran_Silver: AGIMNSS O4 MASSING +92 514
#note I asked her after the game what she drew after AW and she said she did indeed draw SS. So my hunch that she had neither was correct, and barring her seeing SIGMA/UTA, I had a 66% chance to win the game. But of course the plan blows up in my face instead. Goddamnit.
