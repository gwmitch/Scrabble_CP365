#note I don't know CHIVA(R)I, but that looks to be the play. A(R)CHIVE also scores one more point.

#note SPIROID distracted me from seeing PRESIDIO, which was silly. I pass on SPIROID 2x2 here because I want to stop him from hitting 15D cheap and I feel like there's a really good chance I can bingo next turn. 

A sim shows that this is kinda silly, POI only makes him score about 4 less points next turn, and I only score about 8 more next turn.  And clearly, PRESIDIO is the play here.

#note It seems pretty evident that he's close to a bingo, but there aren't too many places to play it. If he DOES hit one, this gives me a prett good shot to hit him back.
