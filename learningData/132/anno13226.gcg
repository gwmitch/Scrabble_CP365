>Dave_Koenig: FOO 8G OOF +12 12
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEGMRV F7 GRAVED +26 26
#note Shorter plays sim way better than this. Just GOV# for 13 appears best.
>Dave_Koenig: ACIP E11 PICA +27 39
>Evans_Clinchy: DELMOTY D10 MOY +35 61
#note Didn't remember that PICAL was good. MELODY to the triple for 48 is best; this is second.
>Dave_Koenig: ?DNOUUV C5 VoUDOUN +72 111

>Dave_Koenig: DEIQU 12J .IQUED +40 219
>Evans_Clinchy: BBEHMOS O7 BOMBE. +39 210
#note BOMBED, MOBBED and HOBBED in the same spot are all about equal.

>Dave_Koenig: ELR 14B REL.. +24 273
>Evans_Clinchy: CFHHNST K11 F.SH +37 278
#note Keeping four consonants is usually bad, but CHNT is a pretty dynamite combo. This looks best, though you could make a case for NTH M7 to set up SNAB#.
>Dave_Koenig: AGNOR M3 GROAN +25 298
>Evans_Clinchy: CEHLLNT 5C .ETCH +26 304
#note Correctly decided that setting up the case C with H(UM) wasn't worth the point sacrifice, since my rack isn't flexible enough to cash it in. It's good to take the points. But I missed the really sweet spot for (RELAX)E(D) -- HEN for 36 there is better than VETCH.
>Dave_Koenig: EITY 15A YETI +31 329
>Evans_Clinchy: EGILLNN B7 GILL +22 326
#note Another mistake -- firstly, didn't know VETCHLING, and secondly, NILL is way better than GILL for both the leave and the G setup.
>Dave_Koenig: AAIORRU 4I OURA.I +12 341
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNRSZ 3G REZ +44 370
#note Gotta score with the Z here, preferably in a way that blocks as many bingos as possible. REZ# could easily lose, but it's the best option I've got.
>Dave_Koenig: AENNRTT D4 R.NTE +22 363
#note Luckily he has ENTRANT, so his bingo is indeed blocked.
>Evans_Clinchy: AENNSS 15M SEN +25 395
#note SENAS# 2F and SENSA O1 are both better, but I'm not gonna mess around here with a word I'm not 100 percent sure of.
