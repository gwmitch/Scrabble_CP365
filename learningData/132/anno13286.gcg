#note I saw JOULES, but then forget about it as I was THINKING.  I was going back and forth between JOULES and G6 FOUL.  I decided that FOUL was silly and then started looking for a J play on row 11 or row 12.  Eventualy I forgot about JOULES and played the 8 point mistake here.

#note Al's fun to tease.  I laid down my tiles s l o w l y and he started bemoaning over the X before I played the Y.

#note I mess up exchanges like this a bit too much.  QUINOA sims best, but I'm going to ignore that.  Exchanging 6 and keeping the N is really where it's at.  I guess it's not a good idea to keep an A and I since there's so many left?  Yeah, that's it.  Okay, got it.  Moving on.

#note This wouldn't be happening had I not bimboed* on JOULES.  I just have to stop making mistakes and play perfectly every single time.   Piece of cake.

#note I strongly considered shoving my rack down Al's throat, but thought perhaps that will be a little rude.  And I may not be able to come to club anymore.   So I resisted the temptation.
>Tasha: ACCELTY 2J CLE.T +30 278
#note My least favorite play of the game because I know I'm screwing myself.  Not only did I not see YCLEPT (which sucks because I've been dying to play that word for some reason), but I didn't see ACCEPT either.

#note Play MERC and save the Y for next turn.  Okay, this is starting to get embarrasing.

#note Okay.  Here we are.  Pre-endgame.  I had ten minutes on my clock. I've learned to manage my time wisely for endgame.  That's an improvement!  Anyways, I wanted to fish off AO but didn't see a suitable play.  The first fishing play I found was H13 TOGA.   I used about two minutes looking at the pool to see if there's any PLAYABLE bingos with any two tiles and I didn't find any.   Besides, Al isn't exactly asleep.  Then I noticed the possibiity of an 8 through the C.  CANOEIST is possible if I fish off AG and draw IN.   There's only one little bitty probem with that:  Again, Al isn't asleep.  Fishes like that DO NOT WORK on these kind of boards.   They're dumb.  If the board is closed and there's only ONE available bingo line, I'm not going to waste time fishing because my opponent WILL block.  Well, I didn't block in a certain Arden Cup game, but that's beside the point.  I'm an exception.  So then I decided to fish off two vowels in a spot that isn't as easy to block.  I thought of G3 EVADE.   I wasn't too crazy about giving up the case E, but I liked the possibility of now being able to have playable eights with the right draw on TWO lanes instead of one.   That's good, but keeping the G and getting rid of the E is not.  And this will have to be a VERY lucky draw and Al would have to block the wrong lane.  It's much more likely that he'll block COASTING because it's easiest and the only bingo I see on row 3 is AGOUTIES anyway.  Not good, not worth it.  Anyways, Quackle suggests playing 13H GOAT.  Nope, not the play I'm looking for.   I may as well play TOGA if I'm going to play that.  In the end, I didn't fish at all because I couldn't find a play that fishes off the right tiles - AO  in this case - that creates a lane that isn't easy to block.  Such a play DOES exist and I wish I would have saw it over the board.

#note If I'm still jacking up endgames by episode 10, I'm going to take up something easier.  Like Monopoly.
