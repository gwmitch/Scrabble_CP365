>Gunther_Jacobi: ILNORRU 8G LOUR +8 8
#note (Game 2) At 8F is 0.3 better, yet I wanted to avoid cheap TWS front hooks down column E. Maybe Quackle forsees a COZ or FIZ or something similar from F8.
>P.K._Gott: HM 7H HM +22 22
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAIIINR 6I ARIA +11 19
#note Missing RAIA for 6 more. ARIA is bad and dangerous.
>P.K._Gott: CILP 9E CLIP +20 42
>Gunther_Jacobi: ADEIINO E5 IODI. +16 35
#note G5 AIO(LI) is clever, best and overlooked. I considered big turnover plays from E9, which turn out to be better than my choice.
>P.K._Gott: AERU 8A AURE. +18 60
>Gunther_Jacobi: AELNRSS A8 .RSENALS +77 112
>P.K._Gott: EW F6 WE +29 89
>Gunther_Jacobi: BBCEIOV K5 B.B +14 126
#note COBB D3 would've been ideal, leaving EIV. For some reason I gave too much value to the CEIOV leave. COBBIER, VOICER, VOCAB...many choices here as well as chances to go wrong. After some sim, EBB 5J and C3 COBBER top the list.
>P.K._Gott: FKLO D2 FOLK +28 117
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEEIOTV C1 VOTE +25 151
#note Didn't know ORECTIVE!!
>P.K._Gott: GN B6 GN. +8 125
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEINORY B13 YO +19 170
#note FOLKY is definitely best, yet with a play like GNU I thought I should disrupt the lower left quadrant.
>P.K._Gott: ADEN 10G DEAN +20 145
>Gunther_Jacobi: CEEINRS M6 SINCERE +68 238
>P.K._Gott: AERWX 13I WAXER +50 195
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?AEGIIS 8L I.IA +15 253
#note 14H AEGIS! Or EGIS. INIA is 8.3 back.
>P.K._Gott: DIM 14J MID +34 229
>Gunther_Jacobi: ?AEGQST 12H QAT +32 285
>P.K._Gott: EGOUV 15F VOGUE +33 262
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??EFGHS 12L F.H +32 317
#note N10 FEHS 54 is monstrous. 95.6. I kept considering burning a blank for plays like HEFt at 15L. I played much more conservatively, however. To be honest, I never even looked at WAXERS. Yuck.
>P.K._Gott: DEOP 2A PO..ED +32 294
#note Good phony. I had no idea this was invalid.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??EGJST C12 JET +35 352
#note Q likes spending the S here. To perhaps maximize the possibilty of drawing  a vowel or two? While simultaneously leaving one in the bag? Hm...After some sim JET starts to lead>102.0
>P.K._Gott: ENTTY 1E NETTY +29 323
#note FOLKY provides a second play, yet gives almost no hope at a bingo even if she draws one of the two unseen blanks.
>Gunther_Jacobi: ??AGOSZ 2I AZyGOuS +125 477
#note There are so many cool Z plays here that aren't equivalent to this, just neat. Up two.
>Gunther_Jacobi:  (INTU) +8 485
