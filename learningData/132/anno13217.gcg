>Kolton: AGLOSUY C9 .OALY +29 47
>Nigel: CDGHOPS 7F HOG +17 50
#note Too hasty with this play - DOG in the same spot looks a bit better.  I chose HOG for the additional lane it created, but the leave from DOG has more scoring potential. 
>Kolton: ??EGMSU J5 GUMShoE +69 116
#note awesome plays include MUSKEGS, MESHUGA, MAGUEYS, B(L)UEGUMS...  however Kolton's play is pretty awesome in that he had the D hook in mind, whereas I don't think I would have thought of it.
>Nigel: CDIPRST 11H PR.DICTS +76 126

>Nigel: ADJLOUW O11 .LOJD +42 168
#note Missed SAJOU in the same spot. probably should have considered WUD O7 as well.
>Kolton: EEFHIIT O1 THIEF +44 222
#note another option is FI(C)HE M9 for 45...

#note FUG U, FUGU!
>Kolton: AEEIORZ A10 ZO.IER +45 281
#note probably safer than something at A4
>Nigel: AADGLTU M2 GLAD +22 253
#note I just learned 3 words, all of which are better than my play: DU(C)AT DU(C)TAL & DU(C)AL.  I probably should have played this at 6C but I didn't notice the spot.
>Kolton: ABENORU M7 BAN +30 311
>Nigel: AAEEMTU 6D EAT +18 271
#note Quackle also likes TEAM 4D (...), EAU 13F (makes an interesting lane) ... I don't know. Nothing looks very good here... any suggestions?
>Kolton: ENORTUV H11 .ROVE +33 344
>Nigel: AEIMRUY C4 YUM +14 285
#note Other plays that seem decent are M11 CYMAE, 11E YE, or L3 AY
>Kolton: BINNTTU 15G B. +4 348
#note gives shots for a bingo to the G while blocking some lanes
>Nigel: AEEIIQR 4H QI +44 329
>Kolton: INNPTTU 2G PUTTIN. +12 360
#note Quackle says PUTTO 13K is 7 better, but we shouldn't let the robots tell us what to do.
