#note All clearly best so far.

#note Fine play. Another possibility would be TWITTED (12D), going for turnover with the 2 blanks unseen.

#note The only play that comes close is UH (11D), keeping the potent EGILN, but 12 points is too much to give up.

#note I would have gone with MEDIALS, but it's a minor quibble.

#note This seemed like a clear choice: huge score, retains the Z for a minimum of 30 next time. Actually, there were some other interesting choices. ZYGOID (15J,60) keeps FOH (B2,33) in reserve (or vice-versa); or there's FIZ (3M,43) keeping YODH (13C,41). What a rack!

#note I think this was as good as anything. EBON (2A) sims highest, but keeping the UV combination seems hopeless. Then again, he could draw ORR.
>Bing: AFOORRZ 3M ZOO +49 472
#note I thought I could survive a bingo, but it may have been right to block the 5C line. This seemed better than AZO so as not to set up the N-hook.
