#note Carol challenged the play, possibly because she misread my hesitation. I hesitated about placement, however, and not about validity.
>Steve: AEGINPW E5 WEA.ING +44 110
#note missed PAWNING and thereby 9 equity points.

#note I saw Q's best of GAP at 10h, but decided on this one because it turned over tiles and took out a bingo row. It proved to be right when she challenged HAIKA.

#note Saw the lesser scoring bingos here (63, 61 points), but wanted to avoid getting stung with a power tile down the H column. I think this played out to be right, as the JX and Z came off her rack shortly thereafter.
