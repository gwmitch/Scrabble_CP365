#note  I labored over this one.  The computer like EXEC=26[AIS?] and SEICHE=33[A?] before mine.  The two bingoes SEApIECE are 5th and 7th.

#note by far the dumbest move of the game.  I think I like I(D)OL best, but AGIO/AHI/GIN/OMEGA is pretty sweet.

#note this wasn't really a very strong play.  It does a pretty good balance job, but opens up needless lanes in a close game with some good tiles in the bag.

#note I like this play better than all of the 1 and 2 tile plays that Quackles suggests.  I would really like to hear input if anyone has any.
>Lisa_S: AELRSSU K11 SALE +28 362
>Brett_H: AIILNW O4 WANL. +15 366
#note  Such a bad play.  One of the reasons I played such a bad end game, is because she had misaccounted a play early in the game and I thought I had clinched.  Plus I was VERY low on time.  I thought I had a 2 point win after her comeback.
>Lisa_S: RSU 14H RUS. +6 368
#note  After the adding of my tiles, the original score we had was 366-364 in my favor.  Whoops.
