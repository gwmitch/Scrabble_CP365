>Brett: AABEMRT 9H BA +14 14
>Dave: DDEOOST 10H ODD +20 38 
#note completely missed EDDO, but it's only 6 more points and I prefer this leave
>Brett: AEGIMRT J2 MIGRATE +78 92 
#note This is where knowing your opponent is a good thing.  Dave doesn't have a history of looking for hooks to longer words.  It was a gamble that payed off...well, sorta.
>Dave: AEORSST 5D ROASTE.S +82 120 
#note sure enough I jump on the 2x2 and don't look at EMIGRATE
>Brett: ADHHOUV I1 HUH +26 118
#note best
>Dave: ?ACFILY D2 CLA.IFY +38 158 
#note I missed some cool bingos here: CALCIFY, CRAFTILY, FIRECLAY, and FANCILY.  I spacled on FLAME taking an A front hook too
>Brett: ADINOVZ H1 OVA +47 165
>Dave: ?EEJRSW 11B JEWlERS +88 246 
#note I did not at all like this play, but let it go convincing myself that it was another spelling and that I didn't really need to challenge.
>Brett: ADEIINZ 8A ZAN. +48 213
#note unfortunately DIAZINE didn't play anywhere.
>Dave: GLLNTVW F4 V.W +17 263 
#note Quackle prefers 6B GLINT 18, but I'm happy to dump the VW pair 
>Brett: DEEEIII -DEEIII +0 213
>Dave: ?CGLLNT C10 C.LT +12 275
>Brett: EEOOPQT 12A PO.O +37 250
#note POLE was probably best here.
>Dave: ?ADGLNR A12 .ANG +21 296 
#note LANDGRAB would have been a cool find had I known it
>Brett: EEEINQT 4J .EE +10 260
>Dave: ?DELNOR 15A .OLDENeR +83 379
>Brett: EINQUTT B6 QU. +32 292
#note  another orphan.  Woe is me.
>Dave: DEIIRUY 2B DI.EY +38 417
>Brett: EINNTTU 3L NUT +8 300
#note  just dumping the doubles.  Looking pretty hopeless.
>Dave: AEEIKRU 1A EEK +30 447 
#note I don't like the leave, but it scores well.  And Quackle seems to agree
>Brett: EIIINNT N1 IN.I +8 308
>Dave: AGIORTU O4 TRAGI +24 471
>Brett: EIINSTX K7 IN +15 323
>Dave: BEOOPRU 14F UPO +16 487
