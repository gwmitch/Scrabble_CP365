>David_K: INP H7 PIN +10 10
>Dave: ?AEELOO G7 OLEA +16 16
>David_K: ?CINOSU 11D COUSINs +71 81
#note Oops.  I forgot OLEA doesn't take an S.  This play fittingly came just a few minutes after we talked about how David is Jeremy's second cousin and how the naming scheme works for more distantly related cousins. 
>Dave: ?DENOTW J4 lETDOWN. +64 80
#note I didn't know BENTWOOD.  LETDOWNS or DOWNIEST seem to be the next best options.
>David_K: FR F10 F.R +27 108
>Dave: KLMNUWZ D9 MU.K +24 104
#note CLUNK or UNMEW are both better
>David_K: AERV C6 RAVE +14 122
>Dave: ILNNOWZ 5G WIZ.N +34 138
>David_K: FITU 6B F.UIT +18 140
>Dave: ELMNOTY 4J .EMONY +30 168
#note I didn't know MYLONITE, and I wasn't sure about MUCKY which rules out most of Quackle's favorite plays here.  
>David_K: EPR O1 PRE. +27 167
>Dave: AADHLRT H1 LATH. +36 204
#note LATHI is probably best, but I clompletely missed the AMUCK hook and so failed to even consider ARVAL or LAVA.
>David_K: HO 3M HO. +24 191
>Dave: ADLRSUV 8J .VULAR +30 234
#note Missed AMUCK again.  ULVA is best.  Though when playing less experienced players, it's good to keep the board more open, which I need to get better at.
>David_K: EILST 2J LISTE. +28 219
>Dave: ADDOOSY A5 DADO +27 261
#note After trying not to be an ass and play phoneys against a non-tournament player I break down and do it.  I really thought this was good.  I think someone has played it against me.  Probably Brett.  13B DAY is best, but again, I'm unsure about MUCKY.
>David_K: EEG 1G G.EE +7 226
>Dave: CDEORSY 13B COSEY +43 304
#note Still unsure about MUCKY.  13B COY is best, but I do like my play here.
