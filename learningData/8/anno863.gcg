>Jerry: AEHINOO 8H OHO +12 12
#note Better than OHIA, mainly for the increased defense (the leaves are about equal).
>Bing: FIKOOPT 9H FOP +24 24
>Jerry: AEIINPR J6 PR..INE +19 31
#note Interesting choice. I would probably play PEIN (10I). 
>Bing: EEIJKOT K3 JOKE +34 58
#note INKJET (11I) sims slightly better.

>Jerry: AEILTUV 14G E.UVIAL +25 132
#note This scores decently and clears the rack, but the 15L hotspot is pretty dangerous. TUI (I13) is a safer option.
>Bing: AEELMOU 15L MOUE +36 183
>Jerry: ADNRSTY 13G Y.N +23 155
#note TRY (7I) is clearly better.
>Bing: ADEEILV 12D VE. +16 199
#note Seems best.

#note Very strange play - CROW (12L) looks obvious.
>Bing: ?ADEELU 5C DEvALUE +69 286
>Jerry: CDEILOS 4A CLOD +29 261
#note Fine. Keeps the score close and opens a new bingo line.
>Bing: ABCGRRT A1 BRA.T +27 313
>Jerry: AEIIRRS 1A .RIARIES +83 344
#note (Challenged off) A big break for me, since RARITIES was playable.
>Jerry: AEIIRRS --  -83 261
>Bing: ACGHNRS O4 CHAN. +13 326
#note Had to block the T, but ARCH (12L) would have been much better.
>Jerry: AEIIRRS F5 .IR +5 266
#note Nothing looks very promising now, but fishing off the IR is certainly reasonable. It might be tempting to try RIVET (12B) for the extra 3 points, but even if that doesn't get pounded by a big G play, it's likely to result in the main bingo line (15A) getting blocked. 
>Bing: AGNRSSZ 6B ZA +35 361
#note This seemed okay at the time, but leaving 7 in the bag ran the risk that Jerry would be able to bingo and draw another unblockable bingo. ZAS (M2) might be better, though it looks strange knowing opponent has the last A.
>Jerry: ?ADEIRS 15A hARDIES. +86 352
>Bing: EGNRSSY 9L S.NS +19 380
#note With best play, SYRENS (8A) comes out 2 points better.
