#note Missed 10G FOLK for 47.  It scires 6 more points, doesn't open a lane and keeps a consonant.

#note Vera played D4 CONES at first then took it back when realizing that NI* isn't good.  I played YA here to block the O since I know she's sitting on ENS and possibly a blank.  
>Vera_Bigall: PS 6D S.P +31 182
#note I realized here that Vera probably doesn't know that OVOID takes an S.

#note I almost played GOLFS here but after much thinking about the pool I played FOCAL instead.  The pool is vowel-heavy but there's also some high-point tiles.  Vera just drew a random rack and unless she has EEHWRYZ on her rack right now, I'm going to win.  If I draw all the consonants, I can outrun her because that means she has all the vowels.  If drawing the Z,  I can play N12 ZEBU and I can dump H, W, or Y for points as well.  Worse-case scenario is 3I WAZOOS with me drawing AAII.  But if she has AOOSWZ, she wouldn't play WAZOOS.  She'll play O1 ZOO.  So FOCAL it is!  All I need to do draw is two vowels and two of the high-point tiles! Piece of cake! I GOT THIS!
