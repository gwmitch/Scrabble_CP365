>Jonathan_Lindh: AAAEKRU 8H AURAE +12 12
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 1: When this dreck appears on your rack for the first play of the tournament, it is often a bad omen. This time it wasn't. Best play!
>Chris_Kulig: ?ACINST H1 eSTANCI. +80 80
#note 2nd best play for Chris! H8 ANTACIDS, K5 FANATICS and a few others are 86.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AABKOSY J6 YA.AK +30 42
#note Terrible miss. KABAYAS was 64 on a 2x2! This probably cost me this game! Mine was the best of the non KABAYA plays. -26.5
>Chris_Kulig: ERRTU L4 URET.R +12 92
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABCIOSV 5K B.AVO +20 62
#note 2nd best play! 2E OVISAC is best by -1.6. A minor miss that would be huge.
>Chris_Kulig: ?EEITTV N1 VETI.ErT +80 172
#note Best play by Chris! I thought only VETIVERS was good.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGIJSS -  +0 62
#note As I was walking to the challenge computer, I remembered VETIVERT was good too. Oops.
>Chris_Kulig: EX O8 EX +33 205
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGIJSS 1L JI.E +66 128
#note Best play!
>Chris_Kulig: HU G3 UH +14 219
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACGMOSS 11J SMOG +27 155
#note Best play!
>Chris_Kulig: LTU O8 ..ULT +13 232
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACDFLS F3 CALF +28 183
#note Best play!
>Chris_Kulig: NNO 2K NON. +15 247
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDDOSY L11 .DD +10 193
#note Oops. 13K DYADS for 33. Mine was too fishy. -19.4
>Chris_Kulig: EGL G8 LEG +11 258
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADFORSY 13I FAD.Y +34 227
#note Best play!
>Chris_Kulig: GHINNPR 12G PHI +17 275
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEOORS E6 OE +7 234
#note DOSER 14J is probably better than mine.
>Chris_Kulig: IP 9I P.I. +18 293
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEORSW 14J WO +29 263
#note 3rd best play! I suck for missing BROWSED. This and KABAYAS were just inexcusable.
>Chris_Kulig: INZ 15H ZIN +42 335
#note I deserved that!
>Jonathan_Lindh: BDEEGRS 7G G. +13 276
#note Fishing the G is right but possibly K13 DOG for 6 more. ZING extensions are very dangerous though so maybe my play is right.
>Chris_Kulig: IQ 13F QI +17 352
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDEERS D7 BEADERS +76 352
#note Best play! I debated doing the new word REBASED to draw a challenge for a few less. I made the right call.
>Chris_Kulig: ENNOORT 1A ROTENON. +74 426
#note Fantastic play by Chris! I didn't deserve to win this after two massive and inexcusable misses of KABAYA and BROWSED and the failed challenge of VETIVERT.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIILORW B1 .WLIER +22 374
#note WORE B2 is 6 better but I was very low on time.
>Chris_Kulig: MS 11C M.S +10 436
#note O4 SOM is 13 and 6L EMES is 12. THis was Chris' 3rd best option. -3 for him.
>Chris_Kulig:  (IO) +4 440
#note Bad start but I would play better games than this one.
