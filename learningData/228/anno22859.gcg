>Guy_Ingram: LOOP 8E POLO +12 12
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 6: The Hideous Game! I botched this one horribly. I should have had a W in this one for sure. To make matters worse, my stupidity had an audience at the end of the game as Tasha Asberry was watching the last few moves when I had several major blond moments.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACEFIO E7 A.ACE +18 18
#note I rejected the FACIAE plays which are Quackle's favorites because I thought they opened up too much stuff. APACE is 7.9 back but I think it is fine. Maybe 9D OAF?
>Guy_Ingram: ABEM D4 BEAM +20 32
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFILMOO E1 ALOOF +30 48
#note Best play!
>Guy_Ingram: ATX F1 TAX +27 59
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?IIMNRT 7H MINTIeR +63 111
#note This was a mistake. I needed to NOT play the bingo here and play 1A IMITATOR for 90, a non-bingo 3x3. That's the play! My mind was focused on the unplayable INTIMATER which I actually knew as a 9 I studied. -27.2
>Guy_Ingram: ?DGIIOT J1 IODaTI.G +63 122
#note Thankfully Guy misses DITTOING for 86.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABIRVVW 4H BR.VI +24 135
#note C1 VIVA for 25 is apparently best. Mine is 4th. -3.8
>Guy_Ingram: GRZ 1H GR.Z +42 164
#note OUCH!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEGRVW D11 WAVER +29 164
#note Best play!
>Guy_Ingram: NOUY 15A YOU.N +24 188
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEEGIU N1 GAUDIE. +22 186
#note Best play!
>Guy_Ingram: CDEHI 13A CHI.ED +30 218
#note Why did I let this convincing phony go? It blocked REVOLTER which I was going to play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EELORRT O1 OR +17 203
#note 2nd best play! ORT in the same spot! -.6.
>Guy_Ingram: AEEOQST 3M Q.A +27 245
#note That should not have happened.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFLPRT 10E .LEFT +12 215
#note F5 FETOR! This is where my blondness kicked in! ACtually it kicked in when I didn't challenge off CHIVED*. -11.2
>Guy_Ingram: EEJ 6F JEE +31 276
#note FETOR blocks that too!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEHPRSY C3 HARP +33 248
#note Fishing off the Y with OXY 3E or 11G HEAPY are best. -9.4
>Guy_Ingram: NW L6 W.N +7 283
>Jonathan_Lindh: EINNSSY A10 SYN. +10 258
#note SYN J10? Maybe. I'm afraid the board will get shut down though. Mine is OK but not great!
>Guy_Ingram: EILSSTU H10 .UNDIS +33 316
>Guy_Ingram: EILSSTU --  -33 283
#note This play is around the point Tasha began watching our game, just in time to watch my stupidity come out. I did know FUNDIS* wasn't good so I took that off.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINSTU I3 E.E +10 268
#note Don't know my rack.
>Guy_Ingram: DO G2 DO +19 302
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINSTU 3B U. +5 273
#note OH NOES! ENSUITE! I11 is the play!
>Guy_Ingram: KLNSU H10 .LUNKS +42 344
#note I flunked this game that's for sure.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINSST J10 SITES +22 295
#note OH NOES! AGAIN! I missed both SESTINES and the inexcusable LITENESS for 68. LITENESS gives me the game by a point. If I don't go over which I did in this game by 2.5 minutes I win by a point with LITENESS. This was my worst game of the tournament along with the Willl Anderson game. -73
>Guy_Ingram: IT 14H .I.T +8 352
#note 2nd best play! TI K11 is better.
>Guy_Ingram:  (NE) +4 356
#note Since I lost 30 on time, actual game recorded as 357-266 so margin was correct just not our scores. My stupidity had an audience this time!
