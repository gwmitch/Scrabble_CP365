#note I played QUAI instead of QUIP because I know she has a blank and I just emptied the bag.  If I play QUIP, she can bingo out with something like PINNULAR.  I didn't see anything with an I with the remaining pool, and if she bingos out, I'll rather it be chump change on column N.

#note Final scores recorded as 534-332.  After the game, Huguette asked me if AGGIE took any hooks.  I told her I'm pretty sure it takes a B and when I played BOP, I wanted to play 1H PUB but just couldn't pull the trigger.  She checked on her phone and yeah....BAGGIE is good.
