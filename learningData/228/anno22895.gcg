#note Idiotically missing BEGLOOMS... that rack looked familiar and I just didn't think of it. At least I managed to secure my second consecutive 50 point bonus.

#note Can you believe this shit? I leave two I and I draw 3 more I? I have so many I, I can't believe my eyes! The Z plays well on this board so it's not worth playing through with ZITI. Looking to nab a blank to eventually secure a career high third 50 point bonus of the game.

>Rafi: GLMOQUY 1F QU.LMY +20 380
#note Considered QU(A)LM, MY, and QUO(L)L as well. I actually thought I was up by 10 more points because Will underscored OUTWILED (which I discovered next turn). After QUALMY, if Will doesn't immediately bingo I can shut down the lanes completely... there is nowhere else to even set anything up! Also, the lanes available aren't that strong and I can outrun a good portion of his bingos, withstanding the devastating 50 point bonus that most bingos provide. There's a huge case to be made for QUOLL... it leaves just the A which is often an airball bingo, and the Y has some scoring/outrunning potential. One thing that swayed me towards QUALMY was that Will almost never has the H (otherwise FOH) so I frequently will have the flexible-scoring H in the endgame for an out in two to outrun. After QUOLL, if an A bingo hits the triple I'm in worse shape BUT that's not super likely. MY also has a lot of merit... 30 points, and I can draw QUA for 41 sometimes to outrun almost anything. Tricky spot! I think QUALMY is stronger with an additional ten point lead... I might have played something different knowing the correct score. But then again QUOLL is stronger too.
