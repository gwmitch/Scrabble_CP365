#note Q says PILI...I suppose after SNOWY his likelihood of having an S is higher, so maybe PYLON is ill-advised.

#note It occurs to me that I never counted ROTUNDA vs OUTDRANK, and was basically just trying to weigh what I preferred between opening a more dangerous threat for nine-timers (ROTUNDA) or a more dangerous spot for bingos and scoring in general (OUTDRANK). If I had realized ROTUNDA was 11 more I might've opted to play it...
>Guy: ?AENOST 4A NOTEpA.S +70 204
#note ...but as it turns out, Guy had options through both plays - many through an R in 7th position, but only one through an O in 7th, TEASPOON.
