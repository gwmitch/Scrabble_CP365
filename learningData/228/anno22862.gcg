#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 7. I don't recall my rack here but it was bad.
>Kate_FC: EILNOTV F8 YOB +25 25
>Kate_FC: EILNOTV --  -25 0
#note I don't recall Kate's exact play, but involved YOUK and me challenging it off.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAFHNOT 9H HAAF +23 37
#note Best play! Scored as 24. Maybe the other other HAAF instead?
>Kate_FC: EHOPR 8K EPHOR +44 44
#note Not the first time I got burned on a triple with a fairly optimal play.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGNORTT 10K TONG +15 52
#note 2nd best play! 7H DOT for 20 is best. This is fine too. -4.3
>Kate_FC: GIO M7 O.I.G +11 55
>Jonathan_Lindh: CDEGNRT 7D DREG +13 65
#note Best play! Kate blocked DRENCH on her last turn sadly.
>Kate_FC: EILRY D7 .IRELY +22 77
>Jonathan_Lindh: AACNOTY 6F YA +30 95
#note Best play! Doesn't this board shape look terrible?!
>Kate_FC: BER K5 BER... +22 99
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACNOQTU 8A QUA. +39 134
#note 2nd best play! Maybe this is better than Quackle's best QUOTA because it gives less back. BUT HOW DON"T I SEE QUOTA? -11.
>Kate_FC: BO J6 BO +22 121
>Jonathan_Lindh: CIINNOT 9A IN +15 149
#note Note the unplayable bingo. 3rd best play! UNCTION B8 is 1.5 better but this is a tossup.
>Kate_FC: EIITV B8 ..ITIVE +24 145
#note This play blocked my UNJOINT for 60 which I saw.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACIJNOT 5B JOINT +30 179
#note Mine is -5.8 behind L4 JO but that play gives away cheap points if she has an O. I go with mine.
>Kate_FC: ACDL L3 CLAD +24 169
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEEEIL 3J CE.AL +18 197
#note Bad from an equity perspective but I'm not trying to give away easy points. 13A EVE maybe?
>Kate_FC: F I8 ..F +10 179
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEIIMS 4D MIS +27 224
#note N2 ELEMI? 4D MISE plays with the theme of taking out cheap spots. I chickened out and played MIS instead.
>Kate_FC: DEZ 2M ZED +41 220
#note ELEMI prevents this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEEEIPR H3 EEEW +17 241
#note Rack not recorded but I love this play. This hotspot needs to be taken out and I have WAY too many E's.
>Kate_FC: NV 12A V.N. +14 234
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEEINW 3B AWA +17 258
#note 2nd best play! I considered Quackle's favorite O10 AWEE as well. -.5 so tossup. I do mine again.
>Kate_FC: AMNOPUX 11D .UMP +16 250
#note I suspect Kate has a blank now!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEINNOR 2B NOR +21 279
#note ^A EON is the equity play but bingos arent that likely on this board and cheap points should be taken out. This does that.
>Kate_FC: ?RSTTUX 14A T.XTUReS +66 316
#note Quackle's suggestions are strange here. Kate's bingo only is the 3rd best play! STURT or STRUT at H11 keeping an X and blank are somehow best although I doubt it. I think she has to play the bingo here and cross her fingers. Valuation is close though, only -1.1
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEILNS 13G NELlIES +70 349
#note ENSILES for 80 at 15F is what I wanted here. I just wanted to play a bingo and get my W. Blank blindness strikes again! -10.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ADIOST) +14 363
#note Ugly ugly game from a beauty perspective but fairly well played. Glad to know I can grind out one of these games against a 1800ish player!
