#note so it's day 4 and i have a small shot at cash if i win the next 3, but i have a disorder that is called Lack Of Focusing At Scrabble Tournaments Even Though I Am Spending Lots Of Time And Money To Play This Stupid Game, so even though I consider the possibility that, you know, I may have a good leave in my rack, i don't bother thinking about HONG for more than a millisecond. i wouldn't have thought HORDE would sim best, however. -3

#note sims very similarly with GUILT.

>cesar: AADILST D8 .ALID +18 63
#note about two or three turns later, when i had a more clear head, i looked at this rack again and diastral immediately popped into my head. it is such a horrible feeling to be playing for 10 years, and for cash and to miss a bingo, especially one this easy. i'm exaggerating a bit for effect but i desperately need to find a way to learn all the words properly. this was basically the game. -32 also DATIVAL if i'm going to suck.

#note quackle is wrong. 10F QIS means he can play down for the Q and set up a big hook. right??  -1 (actually, quackle ALWAYS sims this way, how do we fix it?)

#note of course it's my fault for missing diastral. this is one of many double blankings i received.
>cesar: AEEINUX O6 XENIA +47 253
#note i liked this play a lot. if he has the Z then c'est la vie, but i need to give myself the chance to draw it.

#note i have NO FOCUS! what's so hard about finding ROMP? if this was an annotated game and i was doing well i would find it. at least i should try to cash right? -6
>robert_f: EEGO B2 OGEE +14 324
#note this is a nice play.
>cesar: DEJLNOR A1 OD +12 358
#note quackle says 2A JO is winningest. i should have believed it. i don't really know why i played this. i didn't like JO because i thought he could outscore me but my vowel is extremely important here. I definitely have to play up there, if not for the possibility of BONNETED (i didn't actually think he had that, i thought he was setting up YOGEE), but because there's too many ways for him to score lots of points. i thought i'd get outscored after JO because of the A in XENIA and an out in two by him. (not to mention BETHORNED, which i'm not sure he will see but he had more than 10 minutes because i'm super slow). i guess i should go through the possible endgames at some point soon. i thought if i kept the J i could set up JO then JOLE etc at E, or JEES, etc etc.
>robert_f: BDEENTY L12 Y.. +12 336
#note he basically has a trillion ways to win this game.
>cesar: EJLNNR E7 J. +9 367
#note i'm not going to take the equity loss for JEU 7A because he didn't see bethorned, quackle.

>cesar: ELNNR 11K ERN. +15 382
#note and then i literally had 12 seconds here and missed several wins!!!!! i even thought of XENIAL at some point. horrible endgame playing :(

>robert_f:  (LN) +4 382
#note See how this game is a tie, and not a loss? I counted OD A1 as 9 instead of 12. I recounted the game, and I counted it as 9 again. Pretty hopeless.
