>Colin_Hyde: DEIOORW 8D WOODIER +80 80
#note Well I've been meaning to start annotating games for a while. So that's what i did today. Let's see how this plays out
>Tim_Mason: BEGMPRS E7 P.MBE +22 22
#note Q likes EMB(O)G at E5 keeping PRS. I can't say I knew EMBOG (Probably time to brush up on my 5s). B(E)G sims second. In hindsight EMPRS was probably a good leave, but I opted for the highest scoring play. 
>Colin_Hyde: CHHNU 7I HUNCH +32 112
>Tim_Mason: AGGIIRS 12A GIGAS +30 52
#note Sims second to IGG @M8. Felt like burning the S was necessary to score. 
>Colin_Hyde: EEV 8M EVE +23 135
>Tim_Mason: AEIOORW 9H OWE +28 80
#note (M)IAOW 9E. OWE sims third. Also WOO(P)IE 7B
>Colin_Hyde: OZ F6 ZO. +36 171
>Tim_Mason: AILOORS G3 ALOO +16 96
#note Bad play. Annoyed that the bingo didn't play so I started to play aggressively. ROO(D) G5 is the play
>Colin_Hyde: ELN A12 .LEN +15 186
>Tim_Mason: EIRSUYY F6 ...EY +44 140
#note Best
>Colin_Hyde: DIR H1 RID +15 201
>Tim_Mason: AIORSUY L4 SAU.Y +42 182
#note ORACY is a slightly better obviously because it doesn't use an S. I have a weird hatred of U's. I try to get rid of them as quick as possible. 
>Colin_Hyde: BEEET 4C BEET.E +24 225
>Tim_Mason: ?AIIORT 1C sARTO.II +58 240
#note I KNEW THERE WERE BETTER WORDS. Obvs the 3 from the V are all better. This among the worst of the available bingoes. 
>Colin_Hyde: PU K4 UP +18 243
>Tim_Mason: AACFILR 2J FRAIL +45 285
#note FACIAL in the same spot. 
>Colin_Hyde: EINTU 5A UNITE +20 263
>Tim_Mason: AACDFMS 6A MAD +22 307
#note This was a stupid play. I don't know what possessed me to play so defensively. SAMF(U) is the best and a word I didn't know. 
>Colin_Hyde: AGL 1M GAL +17 280
>Tim_Mason: ACFIKST 3C AFT +35 342
#note forgot KAF was a word. At the time I liked the CIKS leave. I saw FACT(UM) but thought I was confusing it with FACTOID. 
>Colin_Hyde: CHJQRVX -QVXJHRC +0 280
>Tim_Mason: ?CIKOSS K9 SICKOeS +81 423
>Tim_Mason: ?CIKOSS --  -81 342
#note I thought this word made sense. But alas. A4 K(UM)IS is the play. 
>Colin_Hyde: JR D11 R.J +12 292
>Tim_Mason: ?CIKOSS G10 SICKO +24 366
#note Setting up the S hook which I now know. 
>Colin_Hyde: ENT N8 .ENT +9 301
#note what is happenning
>Tim_Mason: ?ADNSVX 9M X.D +43 409
#note O11 AxONS dummy. This is second. Yay for CSW15 words!
>Colin_Hyde: HINQRT B11 Q. +11 312
#note I should have considered blocking the Q. I don't think he saw 12G (C)INQ which scores 5 more.
>Tim_Mason: ?ANSV 12J NAVeS +22 431
#note LOL good one Tim. AVeNS O11 and SAViN are of course better. I was low on time at this point I think.
