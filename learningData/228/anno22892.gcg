>Jonathan_Lindh: IOTTUVW 8G VOW +18 18
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 15: I get a rematch with Mr. GRISTED* himself who played that phony on me at Nationals. I held for the longest time but accepted it because I had a bingo. It's either VOW or OUTWIT here. Quackle likes 8D OUTWIT best.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: EL 8G ...EL +11 11
>Jonathan_Lindh: CHITTUY J7 T.CHY +21 39
#note TWITCHY I7 is Quackle's best. This is back aways but probably fine. -7.9
>Matt_Dewaelsche: BEGLOS L3 GLOBES +33 44
#note I thought Matt was laying down a bingo. He wasn't.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIJSTU 5K J. +18 57
#note 4th best play! JUDGE was a terrible terrible miss. I was tired. -18.8
>Matt_Dewaelsche: AEGR M4 AGER +26 70
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEISTU K11 ETUI +18 75
#note Best play!
>Matt_Dewaelsche: APR L11 RAP +24 94
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDEFQST 14J Q. +31 106
#note I like QI best but Quackle actually likes FISTED 14J for 42. I think it cuts either way.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: EIL 15H LEI +20 114
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDDEFST N6 DEFT +25 131
#note Best play! Misscored as 24.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: ?AIORTY -AI +0 114
#note Matt exchanged. Not actual rack.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDDENS N1 BAND +18 149
#note This was horrible again. 3I BADGED. SO MANY MISSES! -19.4
>Matt_Dewaelsche: EH O1 EH +32 146
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIMNRS H7 M.D +6 155
#note OOH! SMIDGEN 3H! -10.4
>Matt_Dewaelsche: AIN O8 AIN +26 172
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EINRST 10B TRIENeS +67 222
#note There are about 10 zillion bingos and all are worth 67. The difference comes on comeback from Matt. I like 14B RETSINA best even though my play scored exactly the same. BECAUSE...
>Matt_Dewaelsche: GIINNOZ D7 ION.ZING +88 260
#note Great play by Matt! I suspected something like this might happened. All of my close decisions have back fired on me.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADEFITX E1 FIXATED +89 311
#note Best play! This was the turning point of the whole tournament. I was 7-7 at this point, having lost 3 straight and just being blown out by Will Anderson. This play saved the tournament for me. I would win 5 of my last 6.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: KLOY 1E .OLKY +45 305
#note Matt is not giving up. Good comeback by him.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENORSUV 3C VO. +26 337
#note Best play! NERVOUS is unplayable. RAVENOUS doesn't fit by one square.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: AT E10 .AT +30 335
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENORSUU -UU +0 337
#note UNIONIZING D5 for 24! That may be the play. I decided to be risky and dump UU and fish for the bingo!
>Matt_Dewaelsche: MPRUW 4D W.RMUP +38 373
#note Great play again for Matt. UNIONIZING blocks this. However...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENORRSS B6 SNOR.ERS +60 397
#note I hit my bingo. I misscored this as 58.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: AACEIOU M13 OCA +20 393
#note Best play for Matt! This is actual rack!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEIOU A6 IOtA +18 415
#note Second best play! The best play is the hard to see but SO beautiful 6B SOLEI for 24 leaving EAU to go out at O4, C13, A13, or I2. Mine is 2nd best. I was well under 20 seconds at this point.
>Matt_Dewaelsche: AEIU C13 EAU +15 408
#note 2nd best play for Matt! He misses this word at O4 for 2 more. Still Ok though.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EU 14M .UE +10 425
#note I played it 3 seconds left on my clock. This is best assuming Matt finds his bets out next turn. if not 3L GEN keeping U is actually better! Keep in mind I'm about to run out of time!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (I) +2 427
#note Score recorded as 424-408. This game was a turning point in the tournament.
