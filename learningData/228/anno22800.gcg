>Cecilia: IINTY 8H TIYIN +18 18
>JD: ABCEGTW 7G WAB +24 24
#note I saw BEWIG at K5 which sims best, but for some reason I thought WAB was 26. even then BEWIG is definitely the play, pushing my bingo percentage from 13% to 29%.
>Cecilia: DIMO 6H MODI +21 39
>JD: AACEGPT 5K PAC +22 46
#note the ACET leave is way stronger than AEGT, and so GAP is worth the 4 point sacrifice - I thought this might be the case at the time, but went for the points instead.
>Cecilia: ?DEILOT N2 DELTOId +76 115
>JD: AEGMNTV O7 TAV +23 69
#note I wanted to leave the top-right undisturbed and open the board, but Cecilia is very likely to score quite a few points at the top-right - might as well cover that spot myself and play something like VEG at 3M.
>Cecilia: ?ABIKLR 3G BARnLIK. +84 199
>JD: EGJMNNU H1 JE.N +36 105
>Cecilia: FOTU 9I TOFU +27 226
>JD: EGIMNSU J8 ..U +8 113
#note wasn't sure how best to fish. all of the options like GUM at 10L or JUG at 1J sim very close.
>Cecilia: AARY 11J RAYA +21 247
>JD: EGIMNST 12H MINGE +43 156
#note this is CSW-only!
>Cecilia: AFO 13G OAF +24 271
>JD: EEHPSTU N10 PHUTS +43 199
#note I thought that my S was somewhat expendable with 3 more unseen, but HUMATE at H10 clearly surpasses my play
>Cecilia: NO H12 ..NO +18 289

>Cecilia: GILR F10 GIRL +16 338
>JD: AEEENST 5J E.... +12 268
#note hard to tell whether to play off two Es or just play EPACT. the easiest path to victory I saw was drawing the X and then drawing a lucky bingo that still fit. JEE makes it more likely that I draw the X, but also ends the game faster.
>Cecilia: OOSTUZ 14B OUZOS +40 378
>JD: AEENSTV 15A VENA +40 308
#note I chickened out of VENTAGES here for some reason, but VENTAGES will probably never win me the game - VENA is probably a better, albeit improbable, shot
>Cecilia: GRW E2 GR.W +16 394
#note there are a very limit number of bingos I can have on row 10, but I guess from cecilia's perspective I couldn't have any of them.
>JD: EEILSTX 6B IXTLE +25 333
#note best play. next best is the interesting LITES at 6A
>Cecilia: DENRR E2 .....ED +12 406
#note nice block - WED at 5E scores 6 extra, although then I can slowplay with CEES/SWAB.
>JD: ES 15L ES +9 342
#note 1 point better to slowplay. went over on time
>JD:  (NRR) +6 348
