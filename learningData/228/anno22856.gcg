#note BRR sims two pts better, so Rafi wants to sim 4-ply. Also it likes the 8G placement of BYS ;P Simming 4-ply doesn't change anything. BYS 8G is at the top then by 4 pts!

#note MILD is interesting, knowing that he has an S.

#note This is a super interesting play. -5. Rafi liked DOUTING in the airport, I didn't even consider that it could be better than keeping INOR and blocking a likely lane. However, INOR is not a very good leave. If we use inferencing, it is very likely that Rafi has ES plus a very strong leave. I strongly wish I had considered TROU 5K, which is awesome and goes to the top with this inference. A lot of people don't know it doesn't take an S but I did! :(

#note Rafi picked the worst bingo, but he insists it's the best one. He's probably right because of what it does to the board. -3?

#note IRON is better because my LIR will work better through ON than another R. -2

#note The pool is very friendly to EIRSTV, so GIP sims a lot better than REVISIT.

#note This is why Rafi didn't win NOLA, because he missed F2 HEFT. =)

#note i wish i'd seen CAPON, it's a much better leave and it forks the board. (or PONCED) -4

#note EEJIT C11 is better: sets up a lane and a better leave for playing QI. -4.5
>4chan: ?ABEOOU C5 OBOE +14 364
#note OBOE sets up a bad lane for me and the U is better than average because of the Q.

#note 3G ZIN is 8 better, because it sets up TELE at the top right to go out.
