#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 11: THE BATTLE OF THE JONS! I started this game immediately after I beat Lila Crotty after being triple tripled on. I was hyped on adrenaline and coffee for this game. This was the best play.
>John_Karris: AAIRZ E7 Z.ARIA +30 30
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFORTU I5 FOU.TREE +63 153
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFORTU --  -63 90
#note I saw the best play D12 FOU for 22 setting up my R and keeping a great leave but decided to try this stupid phony. I confused it with the valid FOURCHEE!
>John_Karris: KLOO D12 KOLO +30 60
#note John makes me pay for my recklessness.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFORTU F12 FOU +18 108
#note Best play.

#note 2nd best play! F6 VAW for 28. Bad miss. -9.2.
>John_Karris: GUU I6 GU.U +7 104
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACEEIRT 6H A.E +6 127
#note My fish was dumb. F6 TAWIE. -TOO MUCH!

#note Everything sucks here but HAO D8 fishes the same letters for 5 more points. -5.
>John_Karris: BDE C13 BED +25 189

#note Best play!

>Jonathan_Lindh: AELNRST 3A SLANTER +70 255
#note THE PHONY! John lets this go without a hold. Best valid play is ZOARIAL and BOLO. This was huge because with 2 blanks out, I will probably be picking up at least one.
>John_Karris: IJN D1 JI.N +38 270
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ELNQTY F1 LY. +14 269
#note Quackle has this at -6.4 back but I really like this play. ENQT? has synergy with the S plus I'm cutting off the J to an extent. If I pick up the blank or the last remaining S, QATS and WISEST becomes a game winner.
>John_Karris: FIN 15M FIN +25 295
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEINQT A3 .QuINTED +131 400
#note Best play! Look at the cat dragged in! My highest scoring word of the tournament and my 2nd highest in TWL tournament play period. Highest was CHROMITE for 185 against Lynda Finn in Madison.
>John_Karris: LOY 1D .O.LY +45 340
#note The J wasn't blocked after all.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEGHNT N1 THoNGED +83 483
#note best play! And only bingo! So lucky!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (EEGNSUV) +22 505
#note This game went from a game where I would have been held below 350 and lost to a game where I scored over 500 and won by 165. This game wasn't my best played of the tournament. But it was good enough.
