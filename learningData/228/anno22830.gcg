>Jesse: AAGIRTU 8D GUITAR +18 18
#note JD: all commentary by me has JD in front; other commentary by joey
>Joey: ?ADEORS E4 cARO.SED +82 82
#note I could play AERADIOS again!  But it's two points fewer.
>Jesse: ?AABBSW D10 WAB +24 42
#note JD: spent a long time looking for something unusual. no 7s or 8s in TWL or CSW it turns out
>Joey: AADLNUU I2 UNDULA. +10 92
#note An M would have helped.  This at least got rid of a lot of junk and disrupted the board.
>Jesse: ?ABOOSY F10 BOYO +33 75
#note JD: I saw all 3 TWL 8s (GOOMBAYS, DAYBOOKS and BAYWOODS). In CSW15 I have FOYBOATS#. instead I score.
>Joey: ACILRST 2H C.RTAILS +74 166
#note Now I needed to undisrupt the board.
>Jesse: ?AALRSX G12 AXAL +41 116
#note JD: glad quackle supports my instinct here. with the blank in hand it seemed worth it to open the 3x3 and hope he can't play there, and maybe draw a 3x3 on column O.
>Joey: CILMQTZ 15E ZI.L +39 205
>Jesse: ?EHORSY J5 HORSEYs +91 207
#note  This sure looked good to me, but SHOWERY is the only existing bingo.  JD: only one real bingo is available: SHOWERY. instead, I confused HORSEYS* with HORSIE being new (HORSEY is also good as an adjective) and got away with a big score here.
>Joey: CEIKMQT L1 M.CK +30 235
>Jesse: EEGGNRT H10 EGG +16 223
#note JD: quackle loves fishing a G for a shot at ESTROGEN/ESTRANGE 3x3. Why not at this point? I can also draw an I which is guaranteed to give me a bingo at a number of spots. EGG is a couple of points worse on sim.
>Joey: EIINPQT 5D Q.T +12 247
>Jesse: EEEJNRT G6 JE.E +13 236
#note JD: a little bit better here to sacrifice 2 points and keep EENRT which is 4% closer to bingoing (30% v 26%)
>Joey: EFIINPP 6C FI. +17 264
#note JD: he missed a better spot to play these two tiles...
>Jesse: ENRTUVW -UVW +0 236
#note JD: I debated between keeping ERT and ENRT with 4 more Ns remaining. the bingo percentage with ENRT is higher, but I also run into more bad racks. even on a sim.
>Joey: EFIINPP E13 FI. +28 292
#note I did these turns in an unconventional order.  In the end, it only cost me Quackle efficiency.
>Jesse: EENOORT H1 E.O +17 253
>Joey: EIINOPP 1D OPIN. +8 300
#note Missing SINOPIE, which is way better.
>Jesse: EEINORT O2 .EROTINE +77 330
#note That makes SINOPIE even more way better.
>Joey: AEEIMPT 7B PE +11 311
>Jesse: ENRSTVW 8A WE +19 349
#note JD: I can take one of two approaches - either try to shut down the bingo lanes on right and left sequentially and hope to outrun, or rely on my superior bingo leave (I have the last R and S) and try to build a bingo of my own to retoirt in case Joey bingos. As it turns out I think the disaster potential with NRSTV is too high. Might as well exchange down to ERST now and hope to draw a letter that goes on column A (joey probably doesn't have AAO) or just to draw a bingo. also by exchanging now I leave VV in the pool, so if Joey does bingo he may have to cope with a toxic final rack.
>Joey: AEHIIMT G3 HI +19 330
>Jesse: NNRSTUV N7 TURN +12 361
#note JD: he surely has to be blose to a bingo, so I wanted to block the right side of the board. however the V is in the bag so ideally I would figure out some way to avoid it. Also, I was super-low on time, so I liked that TURN gave me perfect info if joey fishes again, but I didn't have the time to exploit that information. perhaps ERUV is the play - blocks almost as well and ditches a V now.
>Joey: AAEIMOT 11H .A. +3 333
#note At first I thought I would need a bingo, but if it appears that a V stick was a distinct possibility.
>Jesse: DENNSVV 2A VEND +19 380
#note JD: amazingly, no play wins from here! I thought of NEVI at 14B but didn't realize how good joey's out-in-two was and therefore just tried VEND under time pressure. NEVI actually requires quite precise play on Joey's part - he has to play AIM at 13C blocking DEV, and then I can't block on column K because any block still gives him an out-play.
>Joey: ADEIMOT A1 A.ID +30 363
#note Blocking SEV, although there were more creative ways of doing it.
>Jesse: NSV L1 ....S +13 393
>Joey: EMOT K9 MOTE +29 392
#note I could slow play, but this was good enough for me.
>Joey:  (NV) +10 402
