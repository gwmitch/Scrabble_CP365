#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 9: This tournament went well, but why did they change how the prices were distributed to the Class people? 11th got what I was supposed to get...somehow. To make matters worse, Joey wasn't even around to collect the money he won!

#note 4th best play! I was convinved this was best but N7 pROFITER for 93 hooking OBOLI is best. Also N2 ROTIFERS and N2 RETIFORM. I knew all these words but these were hard to see. -10.
>Patricia_Barrett: EGINRTY 12L YING +32 110
#note This was Pat's actual rack. She missed the new word RINGLETY at G4. I know YING is phony. I don't why I accepted this. I was focused on my next play.

#note Score recorded as 436-368. Allowing YING was a horrible, careless move, but my total equity loss for the entire game 17.9 excluding the UNITER block which was right to close things down. This was one of lowest equity loss games ever.
