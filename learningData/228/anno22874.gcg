#note I was contemplating whether or not to flip the board over or throw the clock  at the wall when Kolton made this play.  Right when I decided on throwing the clock, I realized that he didn't block my bingo after all.

#note It took me the longest time to play this because I was chickening out.  I knew there were four bingos in this rack and I couldn't remember whether or not DANGERED or GRENADED* was phony.  Kolton held and I'm like "Oh shiiii....GRENADED* is the right one!" But he doesn't challenge.  After the game, I sadi I wasn't quite sure if DANGERED was good and he said it was because he remembered that ANGERED takes a D.
