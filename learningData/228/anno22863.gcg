#note Simply dropping the U for XU bingos nearly 80% next turn while also fouling up strong scoring plays on row 13, but ECU is a not too shabby 50+% and 11 more points.

>W: CEEMNOY 14J YEOMEN +51 382
#note I looked for a while for a play along row 2 that hooked MM or MY, but neglected to consider overlaps that didn't quite reach that spot - 2A ENEMY. My play sims closely with ENEMY but at this score and with JZ lurking for easy bombs through YEOMEN, ENEMY is clearly superior.
>Joe: EEGIINT 2H .EIGNITE +72 361
>W: AABCOPR 15L PARA +46 428
#note Considered BECAP and BAP, which sim a touch better. I didn't quite put together the puzzle of this turn. I was still quite concerned about heavy power tile plays through YEOMEN to the triple, but after REIGNITE and my draw of two As, it was going to be much more difficult for Joe to hammer me there. JANE was out, and JINN/JINS would've required much more precise draws of the case I, and all of the Z plays that fit there also require that final I (ZINE/ZING/ZINS) - no more O's for ZON? plays. Given the heavily reduced threat of that spot it makes a lot of sense to play for only slightly lower scores up top, retaining much better chances for a potentially game-ending bingo by shedding the B and still scoring quite well.
>Joe: BEJL O1 J.BEL +45 406
>W: BCENNOZ 4A BONZE +40 468
#note The normally appealing G3 ZERO was immediately discarded because of the 4 consonant leave with a consonant-heavy pool to draw from. However, I was very close to doing 12J BONZE for the same score, as it looked to slightly reduce Joe's bingo chances, particularly the ability for him to play QU- bingos from K4, at a cost of yielding huge BONZER/BONZES hooking plays - which I felt I could withstand after taking a 60 point lead. Championship Player considers this to be a massive mistake and I have to agree.

#note As is customary against Joe an excellent draw bailed me out.
