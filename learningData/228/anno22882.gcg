>W: ABDERTZ E4 BRAZ.D +36 36
#note Considered BIZ, TABERED, and BRAZED here. If I felt it were more likely that Ed's responses would make a place for me to play ZA at F10 after TABERED, I might've done that. Quackle likes BRAZED least, but it looks OK to me.

#note F2 VOE/VEE looking decent to me now, especially after CIS.

#note Debated between C3 HOP and APHONIA for a long time, and given Ed's last few turns, it was probably a bit foolhardy to open such a huge spot, but it seemed possible that Ed had a blank and no S and it wasn't really as scary as it looked. CP prefers HOP slightly.

#note Time pressure starting to be a factor for me here...I spotted TAILPIPE but didn't feel I could play it and allow Ed to negate my advantage even without a bingo, or take full control with a bingo of his own. I simply didn't think of SPILITE.
>Ed: ?EILRRT A8 .RTERIaL +74 357
>W: ?EILMTU C3 MU +22 320
#note Again seeing the 8 through the A and not wanting to pull the trigger, and missing the 7 I would have played, MULLITE. I had something like 2 minutes left here.

#note Considered holding off on the bingo here briefly but the clock was ticking...

#note Couldn't ask for a better draw...lucky to escape this one.
