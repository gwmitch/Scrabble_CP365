>dacrON: DDENNTU 8G DUN +8 8
#note Thought about DUNNED or DUNTED, and against many opponents is the obvious play. I am OK with the sacrificed points and equity here against TEAM KOLTONICUS. I wasn't sure if DUNNED was good, and might've tried it if DDENNTU bingoed with more tiles, but it didn't, and it's good anyway. I may have gotten the challenge from Kolton though. I stand behind my play in this situation, though.
>Kolton: EIVW J6 VIEW +23 23
>dacrON: DENOSTT 9H TO.N +13 21
#note I chose TO(W)N over NO(W)T because it set up the -ED line, but NO(W)T also sets up an ED line - whoops! In hindsight, that makes NO(W)T better because it sets up the same lines but gives less back.
>Kolton: EGIORT 10D GOITER +15 38
>dacrON: DEEESTY L8 EYE +18 39
#note Throwing the D on for two more sims slightly better - makes sense now that my other ED lane is gone.

>dacrON: ACDIOTT 11C DOIT +19 92
#note I thought of DACOIT, and found this spot, but didn't put the two together. 8 more points is helpful here. Not a huge fan of 6E (Q)AT.
>Kolton: OU C11 .UO +8 97
#note Kolton spent a long time here, long enough that there's no way he was looking at an all-natural rack. Definitely factored into my decision making process throughout the game. Sure enough, he did have the blank here.
>dacrON: ACEINST M2 CINEAST +72 164
>Kolton: ?AAELMX 12B L.X +42 139
#note 12A EA(U)X scores more, opens more, and keeps a more balanced leave. There is a bingo here, AX(O)nEMAL, but it is almost certainly not the right play.
>dacrON: AORSTUW L4 OW +19 183
#note Kolton has the blank, so I really don't want to play in column N. I thought about adding the T on too, for the addition control it applies to the board; that said, there's only 1 T left, and the T provides some good strength to my rack, I think. Maybe that doesn't outweigh the control as well as limiting the comebacks at K1.
