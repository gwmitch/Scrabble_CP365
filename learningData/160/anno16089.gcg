#note After the first two games of the afternoon, I was so shocked that a bingo materialized, that I didn't even give my rack credit for being a 7. It's that kind of thinking that so often does me in, and I get punished brutally for it. Maybe I'll learn this time.

#note M2 WIGS wins the sim. Probably because W(A)G blocks too much to sacrifice 21 points.

#note This seemed like a good opportunity to sneak one by, versus 4A MILIA. It also got my head back on straight, reminding myself that I'm a capable player and that RENDZINA hasn't killed me.

#note I don't see how playing at M1 can ever win me the game. I don't really see how this does either, but I thought maybe it'd allow me something I didn't think of.
>Nigel: ?DEENUX 4L .E +5 421
#note Actual rack.
>dacrON: AEELSTT 3B .T +8 333
#note Don't think I can trust a sim here. Nigel's obviously got some firepower on his rack - I'm hoping the X isn't among it and I can sneak LATEXES down with a lucky draw, while he misses a draw. Even that's unlikely to make a play like this. And even so, this seems like a pretty reliable play for bingoing next turn anyway to cut spread.

#note Deserved this loss. Although it is reassuring to see that after I put my head back on straight, I played quite well (I think?)
