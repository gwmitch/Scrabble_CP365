#note 3F VAN sims best, but it seems a bit risky to put everything on the GETUP lane. Granted, KC has few options after VAN, but I'm not even necessarily back in the game if I do bingo with GETUPS next turn...even then I need the right 2 or 3 tile draw. But I wonder, if I can hook (AGE)R next turn and set up the S and hope that A(G)E wasn't a fish, that perhaps I can backdoor my way into this. All that thinking aside, I'd rather just go for a most likely bingo and try to get back into this game ASAP.

#note 3F RAN is an obvious improvement on this play.

#note 6E LO is the only play worth making here. It's sad that this game has gotten so desparate that I need to fish for QINTARS, but even just the T gives me TRANQs. Of course she could have the S by now, but that's a risk I have to take. Definitely not thinking clearly anymore.

#note This is a poor play. Admittedly I missed the awesome L8 spot, where dropping the O doesn't hurt me I draw into the abundances of Is remaining. Things are bleak regardless, but that gives me a legitimate fighting chance, I suppose.

#note The game appears to be over, so I figured I'd sneak some spread in.

#note KC has LAE(T)RILE here.
#note D4 (C)O(I)NING is 11 more - cool!
