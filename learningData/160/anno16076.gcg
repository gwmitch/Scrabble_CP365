#note Final game, we're playing for last place... 
>John_Stardom: ?EILMNO 11D LIMO.eNE +82 82
#note Nice find.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEKORSU G7 KOA +29 97
#note I think I'm making my leave up. I can't read what I wrote.
>John_Stardom: RTU I5 RUT +12 94
>Joshua_Sokol: DEINOSU 5F DOU.INES +68 165
#note I decided against INSOU(L)ED last second. I don't know why.
>John_Stardom: AFMR 4L FARM +36 130
>Joshua_Sokol: CGHIIUW O1 WHI. +36 201
#note I hoped he wouldn't see extensions to this. I had WHIMSICAL in mind.
>John_Stardom: AZ F4 A.Z +33 163
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIOOOV D8 OVO.O +18 219
#note D9 OO(L)OGIC I guess.
>John_Stardom: EJNT 8A JET.N +36 199
>Joshua_Sokol: CDGIILR 14E GRID +17 236
#note I meant to play GIRD. I should have played RIGID. I didn't know RIDGIL, but that seems best. Oh wait, I was fishing for WHIMSICAL.
>John_Stardom: BHT 10C B.TH +34 233

>John_Stardom: CIL 2L LIC. +18 251
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINOUY 3K OI +9 291
#note Ultra blocky. Probably not right.
>John_Stardom: ANP J4 N.PA +30 281
>Joshua_Sokol: AENPTUY 9B TA. +15 306
#note I felt better now that the lines were closed down.
>John_Stardom: ADN 14J DAN +19 300
>Joshua_Sokol: EENPUUY L12 P..Y +26 332
#note I'm really just hoping to outscore at this point. This looks really bad.
>John_Stardom: AER 15L .ARE +21 321
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINSUU -EUU +0 332
#note I need a six at J8 next turn.
>John_Stardom: DEV 4C DEV. +16 337
#note John is making good plays, but he's low on time.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINSWY 8J SINEWY +46 378
#note I blocked his SQUEGS bomb and secured the win. SWEENY is better because of the sheer number of E's in the pool. I didn't know it.
>John_Stardom: EGQSSU C12 SUQ +26 363
>Joshua_Sokol: BEEFTTU 10K BUTT +12 390
#note I thought he had a W for some reason so I didn't want to give him points with FEEB 3A. It's better to play 9M FEE first, but I was scared he could block both BUTT and BUTTE. Scored as 11.
>John_Stardom: EEEGLOS 15A ELSE +28 391
#note O10 SEGO is best by 1 point. LOSE instead of ELSE would have been appropriate and ironic. Sorry, John...
>Joshua_Sokol: EEF 9M FEE +31 421
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EGO) +8 429
#note I forgot to add his 8 points to my total score too, so final score 420-391. Oops. Turns out John had WHIMSIED and WHIMSICAL on LIC(H) turn.
