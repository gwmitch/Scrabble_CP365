#note I thought I botched up this turn but it sims really good.  A few plays are within 2 points, but this is not bad.

#note I didn't even notice the bingo MAQuETTE for 104, but it sims worse than QAT anyhow.  73 pts and keep a blank? woohoo!

#note Quackle likes 11E FE best.  I really wanted to fish off just an E for (V)IDEOFIT# with four I's unseen, but I can't really open another easy bingo lane doing that.  Adam will block the bingo line.  I thought of just (GUIDE)D so I can fit (ASH)E(D), but I'm not likely to bingo starting with E.  So I thought DEFOG might threaten something if Adam's rack is dreck.  Quackle hates it.  What do you do here?

#note Not a great endgame play, but I'm 0% to win anyhow, and out of time.
