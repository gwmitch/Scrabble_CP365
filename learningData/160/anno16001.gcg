>Doug_Lundquist: AAAIQU 8D AQUA.IA +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DDEILR K5 DRILlED +99 127
#note I wasn't 100% on AQUARIAL but it made too much sense.
>Doug_Lundquist: HOOW J10 WOO +30 47
#note I saw an H.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENOTTTY D8 .TONY +16 143
#note I guess you could call this an equity blunder. I thought ETT was at least a positive leave.  I also missed TENTY/NETTY L10.
>Doug_Lundquist: DEHV L10 DEV +25 72
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEGTT I7 G.E +12 155
#note I guess TAG/DEVA isn't terrible, as there's still only one s hook. Everything else looks way too dangerous.
>Doug_Lundquist: BH G7 B.H +24 96
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEKLTT 13I CLEAT +35 190
>Doug_Lundquist: AEFR E10 FEAR +28 124
>Joshua_Sokol: GIKLNPT 5E PIK. +20 210
#note My play is simming well, behind 6J P(R)INK and C12 PINK, both plays I would never make with a decent lead. Maybe just K(I)P here is stronger, or maybe I should go with P(R)INK and stop being paranoid.
>Doug_Lundquist: EIMNO L1 MONIE +23 147
>Joshua_Sokol: GGLNOTY 2J GO.NY +26 236
#note GO(O)GLY is cool. This is probably the most defensive play I can make.
>Doug_Lundquist: EEJSS N10 JESSE +64 211
#note 2 S's still out, this is scary.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABGLOTU O8 BLOT +29 265
#note GAOL maybe?
>Doug_Lundquist: FOX 4D FOX +39 250
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEGIU 1L .EAD +28 293
#note I had no idea JESSE took a D. This play could have spelt disaster.
>Doug_Lundquist: HRSU 15L RUSH +37 287
#note Whew, could have been worse.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGILTU 1F TEGUA +21 314
#note I was scared to make this move, but at least T only allows AIO. I couldn't be too afraid though, since it's a close game. 3-plied this and LUTEA and TEGUA are oscillating.
>Doug_Lundquist: EINNS 6B NINES +26 313
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIILRT B3 gLI.TIER +59 373
#note I took soooo long to make this move. I was second-guessing EVERYTHING. TINGLIER? GLINTIER? Is it just RETILING? Is NITRILE an adjective? I failed to see fIRELIT 2A during this whole time staring at the N. It's the obvious winner of any sim you will ever do, but somehow it loses sometimes. gLI(N)TIER and fLI(N)tier are next, and 3C TIL is in close 4th.
>Doug_Lundquist: AINPTUW 3E PAW +31 344
#note A9 WAIN is ahead of everything else, as it sets up T(WAIN) for next turn. I'm convinced that I'm Z stuck.
>Joshua_Sokol: MORZ A8 MO +26 399
#note -33. How in the hell did I miss (C)OZ I13? I think I was low on time, but still.
>Doug_Lundquist: INTU 12L .I. +8 352
#note -2 to 11I N(ODE)? why?
>Joshua_Sokol: RZ 12D ..R +6 405
>Doug_Lundquist: NTU G7 ...T +9 361
#note I gave him YARN...
>Joshua_Sokol: Z -  +0 405
>Doug_Lundquist: NU G12 NU +10 371
