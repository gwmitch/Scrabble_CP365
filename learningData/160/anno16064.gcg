#note I didn't know OUTRIDER was 100% valid, and my placement seems better defensively. Still, I think it's best to get 7 more points in this situation.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIOUV D2 VOI.E +20 211
#note I missed the pretty likely better 13D AVE(N)UE. I really hoped I would draw some consonants here, or that Jason would also need to play something with a low valuation, but he has already bingoed twice in a row before me and played VEG which seems to balance his rack, and I haven't drawn another S or a blank, so I'm not happy with this move. I think AVE(N)UE is a great improvement.
>Jason_Li: AX 13L AX +38 218
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEJOTU C3 JO +38 249
#note Fairly happy to have drawn this. It seems like this is going to be a scoring fest unless Jason bingoes again, but none of the spots are that good.
>Jason_Li: HMRT J10 TH.RM +18 236
#note I'm starting to think that VEG was a forced play with at least 3 other consonants, and that AX didn't balance his rack very well. I'm happy that this play gets rid of the lane created by OUTRIDE.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABCEETU 13B BEATE. +21 270
#note I don't know why I missed 13C BUTE(N)E. It's a rather large improvement. I had just played Robin the day before and played a phony similar to BUTENE while thinking of BUTENE. I could play I12 (D)AUB here too, which blocks a big scoring spot for the S I'm sure he has. I also overvalued my leave, which is apparently 8 points worse than CE. This is a bad move.

#note Would anyone play D9 UNIT(A)RY?
>Jason_Li: FGLO 12A GOLF +46 317
#note This was pretty unlucky I think.
>Joshua_Sokol: AINRUUZ A7 RAZIN. +48 351
#note Hoping for a miracle draw after this, as the blanks and SS are still out...
>Jason_Li: ?EEIPRT K2 PRE.TIgE +59 376
#note The sim is close between this and EPI(S)TlER. The only thing I see better about EPISTLER is that there's a chance I'll challenge. Other than that it seems to me that PRE(S)TIgE is better defensively. 
>Joshua_Sokol: DOOOPUU -DOOOPUU +0 351
#note Not the rack I was hoping for. If I keep a D I have a smaller chance of drawing SS?, which I think I need to win. I am replacing 7 of the 12 tiles in the bag with this crap (I guess PD is OK) so maybe I can also outscore in some scenarios. I thought this was my best play of the game, as I did think it through, but I don't see myself winning because of it. The sim doesn't think maximizing my chances at ?SS is the way to go. It prefers keeping O, DP, D and P over keeping nothing. I'm not sure why. This is a very tough position, though, that's for certain.
>Jason_Li: AF 11E FA. +24 400
#note Not playing many tiles so as not to draw what I threw back in is a good idea here I think, and Jason was aware of this.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AADELN 11L AD +17 368
#note Another pretty tough turn. I was happy to draw the blank and some good stuff, of course. I felt like I needed to bingo to win, and outscoring wouldn't work since I know that Jason doesn't have the worst of the pool, even if he just drew my UU. Therefore, I don't think the sim's choice of B8 DAN will ever work, even if I draw OP back for the overlap with (AD)O and (ZA)P. I think outscoring without a bingo is impossible at this point, and he really can't block this setup.
>Jason_Li: ADH B8 HAD +34 434
#note Too many :P
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEELNS N5 LEAvENS +64 432
#note I drew an S as well, wow! The sim somehow thinks that I can win if I play 8K (g)LEAN (which he can just overlap and block), 2K (P)LENA or (P)LANE, which in the even that it yields a bingo for me he can probably figure out how to block or just outscore, and N13 EEL, which will likely lose to any 4-letter play that hooks P(EEL) (bringing his score to at least 470 to my 384 where I would then need to bingo through his 4th tile to outscore), which he has around 1/3 to 1/4 of a chance of having, or he can just hook an S to L4 EL and basically seal off the only lanes there are, unless I can overlap his play down lane M and still bingo, which probably won't happen. I basically have to draw an S in all of these scenarios, which he has a very very high chance of having at this point in the game (7-tile draw after PRESTIGE, then after a 7-tile exchange I didn't draw it, 5 tiles drawn by him since then, that's 12/19 unseen tiles). So anything at this point is pushing my luck, especially not bingoing, I think. LEAvENS is the best bingo according to the sim. Also, I think the score is closer because Jason underscoring OUTRIDE by 10! What do I do?

#note After a recount, I lose by 10 more. Ugh. This was a good game, though.
