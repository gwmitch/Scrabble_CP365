>Nick_Fraher: ADEIVW 8D WAIVED +34 34
#note This is probably one of the worst performances I had all tournament. You've been warned :P
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGHLOT E3 GOTCH. +24 24
#note 7C GOTH looks pretty strong given the C(HI) possibility next turn.
>Nick_Fraher: DKU 6C DU.K +21 55
#note Then again, in hindsight, Nick would have capitalized with KHI instead, which would have sucked.

#note `Would anyone burn the S here?
>Nick_Fraher: BOX 4D B.X +24 79
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILNSY 4D ...Y +16 54
#note First miss of the game. I'm pretty sure I didn't know ELYSIAN, but I should've, to be playing at the top of div 2... Should I play AY or YA instead?
>Nick_Fraher: OP F2 PO. +21 100
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFILNS F6 .A.F +16 70
#note Second miss of the game. This one is just stupid. I was upset that there wasn't an I to play FINALISE through. How does it then not click that I have FINALES on my rack? I really need to review the words I know.

>Nick_Fraher: GJO 13A JOG +28 358
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEILM 15A AE +9 282
#note I guess I imagined the SI spot would be hard to block, but I think I have to go for points with K5 (F)AME
>Nick_Fraher: MOT 3K T.OM +10 368
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILMU N2 A.IE +12 294
#note I missed UMIA(Q) but this looks like my only shot at forking him. Hoping to draw the R or that he just can't score enough to outrun me.
