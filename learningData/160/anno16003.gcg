>Kent_Nelson: BHO H7 HOB +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFMNOR G4 FOREMAN +79 79
#note Not sure what placement is better. This seems the most defensive out of the 3 79-pointers.
>Kent_Nelson: ?DEEIRR 4E DI.fERER +72 88
#note Phony, but really not worth a challenge due to his other options and my uncertainty. He had In(F)ERRED, pRE(F)IRED and RaRE(F)IED for more.
>Joshua_Sokol: AACLRTX 3B TAXAL +29 108
#note Just J4 (R)AX may be correct here. Also, this is phony. So I got you back, Kent.
>Kent_Nelson: LNOO I8 LOON +16 104
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIIRTU H1 CUI. +15 123
>Kent_Nelson: QT C2 Q.T +12 116
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIKOTT J3 G.OK +19 142
#note This was very bad. 5D KOT(O) seems obvious to me now. I find that I liked TT too much during this tournament, but even so, KOT(O) for sure. I knew AITT wasn't more than 9 points better than AGIT...
>Kent_Nelson: ANSV M1 VANS +26 142
#note Yes, DIF(f)ERER* takes an s for DIF(f)ERERS*.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEISSTT B3 .ASTIEST +64 206
#note Would you look at that, I was rewarded for a bad play. I couldn't stomach opening a 3x3 for 2 points, but maybe this is just as dangerous. With this mentality I should play A(R)TSIEST or A(R)TISTES, L3. 
>Kent_Nelson: ?AEGNRT A8 ReAGENT +83 225
#note If I played I(N)STATES, he would have spent a huge amount of time looking for an inexistent 3x3... Now it's a race toward the case S.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEINTYZ 12E DITZY +36 242
#note I considered not playing my Z here for points next turn with J10 DEITY or something of that nature. It's hard to tell which is better, but I instantly regretted playing this when I saw that the Z aligned with a triple. I think I should just play it safer with YET, YETI or DEITY at J10.
>Kent_Nelson: CIO H12 .OIC +45 270
#note Yup, easy points he shouldn't have.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGINP 1K PA.ED +36 278
#note Maybe PA(V)ID with the abundance of Es in the pool and the already-existing I on  H14.
>Kent_Nelson: EEJ 13C JEE +23 293
#note Don't know why he played it here instead of just upstairs at 11C. JEE(D) is more points, even.
>Joshua_Sokol: DFGIINW 2L W.D +25 303
#note My mindset was that I had FI(X) next turn, and this still left (WAD)I if I were to have a bingo down O in the near future. I felt like I needed to bingo since I wasn't going to draw the S, I just knew it. The sim doesn't agree, it wants me to play FI(X) this turn.
>Kent_Nelson: AHLOS 15A SHOAL +51 344
#note There it is...
>Joshua_Sokol: AFGIINN D1 FI. +28 331
#note I really feel the need to bingo now.
>Kent_Nelson: EIU E3 ..IEU +12 356
#note Well, maybe not! That isn't a lot of points...
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIINNO 11H A.ION +26 357
#note I also held the case A.
>Kent_Nelson: ELUY 12K YULE +23 379
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGIMNP N10 PE.ING +30 387
#note I spent the longest on this turn. My mindset was that I had OM/MI next turn if he played something that left him with unusable tiles next turn, and B(U)M G2, (NU)MB L11 and M(I)B G14 to go out if need was. Championship player thinks my only wins are 14E IMP(I)NG and 14G G(I)BE, which block his best plays, but this wins. 14H (I)MPINGE wins too. I didn't know the word. IMP(I)NG wins by the most of what I can find. Championship player sucks at some endgames...
>Kent_Nelson: ERRUVW 14G V.EW +18 397
>Joshua_Sokol: BM L11 ..MB +8 395
#note I'm supposed to not go out here and play the B or 10I (O)M, but I felt it was better to be safe than sorry, even though I was quite sure of my tracking. This would have been a whole nother story if I had lost on the recount... The best sequence wins by 10 rather than by 4.
