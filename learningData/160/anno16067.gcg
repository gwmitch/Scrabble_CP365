#note I looked for a little while, didn't see anything, then saw ERIGERON immediately when I started entering this rack. Oh well, it was only 59 points, but obviously a lot better than fishing for 8.

#note Now this is a lot worse than last turn. I remember thinking about FINGERER and not thinking it played, somehow. I was actually playing two games at once, but that's just weird. Also somehow missed FIGURER. Really perplexing. Also some other things better, but those are the big ones.

#note Because of playing two games I wasn't tracking. I did notice ther Z was out, so I figured I'd get another turn and looked for a good out in two, but I didn't see anything great so I figured I'd just take points here. If I was tracking, I'd have had the opportunity to certainly miss the beautiful 14A CENT, setting up an unblockable FYCE, which is best by a whopping 36 spread points and could've gotten me to 759.

#note VEXT/GENT for 11 more, you idiot. A fitting end to the worst-played 700 ever. I hope I can someday get another one and do it in style.
