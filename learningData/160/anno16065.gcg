>Joshua_Sokol: LLNNRTT -LLNRT +0 0
#note Not quite sure why I kept NT here. Maybe because I felt I had a better chance of drawing another R than drawing another N. Still, I think I should have kept RT. I also considered playing TROLL, but that wouldn't do me any good.

>Joshua_Sokol: FLNORSV 15A FOL. +24 97
#note I missed FLOR(A). LRSV is also a better leave than NRSV, so FON(D) over FOL(D).
>Marlon_Hill: IQU 10B QUI. +33 200
#note I felt like the game was already over at this point.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGNRSV H11 .VENS +33 130
#note What good does C7 V(U)G do?
>Marlon_Hill: DELMPT 13G T.MPLED +32 232
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGIRRZ 12L DIG +19 149
#note 8A GARD(A) for sure. I wanted to fake having the case S so that he would lose equity and block, but it wasn't the best of ideas. I felt I was already doomed anyway. Seeing GARD(A) might have given me hope. I didn't think playing F6 ZA accomplished anything, same with J7 ZA(X).
>Marlon_Hill: EV N10 VE. +15 247
#note Well that bluff worked I guess.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIRRSZ F4 RAZE +37 186
#note Though it isn't much of a bluff if you actually draw the case S... Again I thought ZA or ZA(X) accomplished nothing, and SIZE just blocked one of my only lanes, so better to open things up.
>Marlon_Hill: DEHK 8A KHED. +45 292
#note Punishment for missing that spot twice in a row.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOORSU -OOU +0 186
#note I don't know, 4D OU(R)IE? I'm trying to maximize bingo % for next turn and prolong the game as best I can.
>Marlon_Hill: GLNORTY 15H .TRONGYL +89 381
#note Cool word, might have baited a challenge against someone else, but I knew it. I like words like STRONGLY/STRONGYL and FLUTY/FLUYT.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEIRSY 7B AY +23 209
#note I got the B I wanted. Do I play 3C YERBA? probably. I didn't want to block myself here.
>Marlon_Hill: ?ACMNOO 5E M.CArOON +94 475
#note Damn, nice.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIINRS 3F BI +21 230
#note I saw BRINIES and I just stopped thinking straight I guess. I thought it didn't play anywhere. But that makes no sense, since I played BI... Not that it matters at this point, as I actually do want Marlon to win this tournament, so why not give him some spread to work with? :P
>Marlon_Hill: EEW 6J WEE +31 506

#note Does this mean I win?
>Marlon_Hill: AAO 14G A.OA +20 526
>Joshua_Sokol: EILRRSU 10L LU. +6 259
#note I'm not simming this but I bet this wins it, since he would have to play (E)T to block, for 2, keeping terrible crap.
>Marlon_Hill: GI 1H .IG +7 533
#note blocking the best he can. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIRRS 8G ...A +20 279
#note I'm not drawing the T... but it's worth a shot!
>Marlon_Hill: EIIOOTU 14N OE +16 549
#note -3 to 11A OI.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIRRS M5 SRI +23 302
#note I didn't really know what I was doing, and I was low on time. I chickened out on (BIN)ARIES, and didn't track. I also didn't think AIRERS was a word.
>Marlon_Hill: EIOTU B10 .UIT +13 562
#note -13 to 4B OUTE(R).
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIR 6B RAI +19 321
#note Still didn't like AIRE(R).
>Marlon_Hill: EO 2J OE +9 571
>Marlon_Hill:  (E) +2 573
#note I made some mistakes, but overall it seemed like this game was unwinnable. Althouh you never know what would have happened if you made the right play every time.
