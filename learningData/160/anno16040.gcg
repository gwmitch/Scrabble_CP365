>Siddharth_Murali: INOPRSV H7 VINO +14 14
#note Considered VINOS, but this sims best.
>William_Clark: AEEGRTT 8G A.GRETTE +60 60
#note Scored as 59.
>Siddharth_Murali: AANPRST O8 SPARTAN +110 124
#note High word of the tournament against the eventual champion! Unfortunately, he wouldn't fall for my reverse hook bait.
>William_Clark: AW J6 WA. +14 74
>Siddharth_Murali: ACFKOOU N10 KOA +37 161
#note Sims second to FOU for 31 in the same spot.
>William_Clark: BEIRTU M3 TRIBU.E +22 96
#note Scored as 24.
>Siddharth_Murali: ACEFIUZ 4L F.IZ +52 213
#note I think I would play FUZE K3 37 on a do-over even though it sims second to this. It's about 0.9% behind but that's not enough for me to deviate from my playstyle.
>William_Clark: EEG O1 GEE. +42 138
>Siddharth_Murali: ABCENUU 10G B.UNCE +12 225
#note Shows up as 11th on the sim after 5,000 iternations. Not good. Still, it drops my winning chances from 84.8 to 82.3% so although a bunch of plays are better this isn't that bad of a mistake. Just board shaping paranoia.
>William_Clark: EFL K10 .LEF +18 156
>Siddharth_Murali: ADITUVX 14I VATU +19 244
#note I'm taking this over 12H DUVET, L12 TAXI, M12 VATU, 12J VEX, M12 TUX, and 11D DIVA (the plays that sim better). Especially M12 VATU. Is Quackle oblivious to defense? This is still only 2% off.
>William_Clark: IIIIIOU -IIIIIOU +0 156
#note Forgot how many he exchanged.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEHIIOX M11 DEX +29 273
#note This is just more paranoia, but this doesn't seem like a bad play. The obvious OXIDE sims best but I'm just not playing that.

>Siddharth_Murali: ADILLOR 3G LIDO +14 315
#note I spent really long on this turn, but it sims second best. I just didn't find the easy bingo. :/
>William_Clark: JOY 11E JOY +33 291
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AAAILR 4A mALARIA +64 379
#note This is only marginally behind bingoing above for 68. I'm playing this any day though. TALARIA is the only other bingo and it's a word I did not know.
