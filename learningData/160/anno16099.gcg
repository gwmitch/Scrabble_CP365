#note So I thought this play scored 18, and felt pretty dumb when Doug correctly identified my mistake. For 15 points, this play is no longer worth it.. If I throw in a +5, it barely wins a sim, so for 18 points, I'm still probably better off trading. Keeping the A(!) wins the sim, with keeping the E right next to it. Keeping PE is quite a bit further back. These exchange plays are tough to evaluate correctly, as I don't feel like I've learned anything by having Quackle tell me keeping the A is best. My mistake aside, thoughts?

>dacrON: ANORRUX 11J XU +27 135
#note Was all set to play 11J ROUX, and then second guessed my instinct and changed to this play. When you're going for a very controlled board, it's important to not let paranoia influence your decisions.
>Doug: OW J1 OW +26 101
>dacrON: AAENORR 6F A.ORA +10 145
#note Doesn't seem worth it to give up on my controlled board strategy here with 11D ORA(T)E or 11C ORNA(T)E. I keep a balanced leave that works well with the pool, and he's going to have to open at some point. Also, I still have a modest lead that should aid me if things go south from here.
>Doug: QU 2F QU. +32 133
>dacrON: EEFNRRT 11D FRE. +18 163
#note QU(A) was not helpful for my cause, and now I'm forced to make a play like this one. The bright side is, there are lots of AAAAAEEEEEIIIIIIII for me to draw to go with this ENRT leave, and I should have lanes to work with next turn.
>Doug: ACEP 12A PACE +32 165
>dacrON: AEINRTW B6 ANTIWE.R +71 234
#note I like the board position after ANTIWE(A)R more than TAWNIER. His potential simple plays through the A I'd put at I13 will score points and open a rough lane to deal with. True, he can bingo more after ANTIWEAR, but his scoring options are a lot worse if he doesn't have one. That's the probability I like more here. Also, the longer it takes him to bingo, the more I can control the board, which is not as likely after TAWNIER. Am I missing any solid reasoning here that makes TAWNIER better?
>Doug: AEILT A4 TELIA +28 193
>dacrON: ABDEGIM C2 GIBED +22 256
#note The point sacrifice is just a bit too much here. I liked saving AM for AQUA next turn, while blocking off the higher scoring lane. Doug just played off 5 tiles, so he could have anything. My thinking was on the right track, but I gave too much thought to the IIIII remaining, which biased my thinking a bit too much. BADGE or GAMBE seem pretty interchangable here as the best plays.
>Doug: SUV 2A VU.S +16 209
>dacrON: AAKLMNT 13D TANK +19 275
#note I do risk a J? or Z? play despite my case A, but that seems highly unlikely after VUGS.

>dacrON: ABLMNOT H12 BALM +42 317
>Doug: HOS E4 OH +29 262
>dacrON: JNOORTZ 12K TROOZ +50 367
#note Considered 15H (M)OJO and 15F JO(M)ON (laid down the latter one, even, so he knew I had the J!) to block the last lane. The problem I then foresaw was that Doug could easily make a 2 tile play at 6L that I might not be able to block effectively enough. I didn't think he had all of ??S, but I thought there was a chance he might after next turn. It seems like I can outscore Doug with J firepower if he bingos through the Z (worst case scenario) most of the time. I'm inclined to think I made the right play here, and if you don't already know what's coming, I think you'll see why I want to believe that (although I do regardless of this game's actual final score). :)
>Doug: EIIIMST 6L .IM +11 273
#note Doug's actual rack here. He noted that he was one off of ITEMIZES. Even with a play like ITEMI(Z)ES, he only wins if ?? is in the bag. Unfortunately for him, he has no shot at a win here. But fortunately for me, he gives it the old college try.
