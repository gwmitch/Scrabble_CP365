>Andrew_Fisher: DNPRSST 8F PST +10 10
>Alastair_Richards: EJLRU G3 JUREL. +22 22
>Andrew_Fisher: ADLNRST H1 DRAT +30 40
#note Conscious of my vowel shortage/bingo leave, Alastair was likely setting up an A or O overlap in column H, so I was glad to draw the relevant tile.
>Alastair_Richards: ?AAERTZ 7G .AZARETs +79 101
#note Turns out I blocked JAZERANT
>Andrew_Fisher: LMNNOSU L2 UNSOL.MN +76 116
>Alastair_Richards: ABIOO K1 BOOAI +24 125
>Andrew_Fisher: CDEFILQ J6 Q.ID +34 150
#note The choice between QADI and QAID turned out to have an impact later on, but it seems clear to avoid the vowel at J9
>Alastair_Richards: EGU I3 GUE +22 147
>Andrew_Fisher: CEFGIIL 2J F..LIE +34 184
>Alastair_Richards: INNOU M9 UNION +15 162
>Andrew_Fisher: ACEGIRW 1N AW +32 216
#note Great to see the scoring powerhouse bereft of options. This is where I rued that GAWCIER wouldn't fit, but the same word at 5A isn't too bad - still prefer to take out the O1 spot
>Alastair_Richards: ADHIOTY F5 AH +28 190
>Andrew_Fisher: CEGIRTY E3 GRYCE +42 258
#note I considered the quietish CLY M1 here leaving EGIRT (more defensive), but couldn't resist this scoring opportunity
>Alastair_Richards: IX F8 .IX +28 218
>Andrew_Fisher: AEEGITW E9 TAWIE +27 285
#note With two successive two-tile plays from Alastair, it looked as though he was homing in on a good rack. This led me to TAWIE, hampering bingos in column D and delivering TWS counterplay if he colonises row 14. Simulation gives the nod to the overrash WAGE L12, or WAGER 4A
>Alastair_Richards: ABEELOR 1A LEEBOAR. +92 310
>Andrew_Fisher: AEEGIIT D11 AGEE +23 308
#note Hmm, a pretty poor play here in response to LEEBOARD. I think it's the top score, but the leave is not ideal; nothing is really very palatable, with GEIT L12 simming best and leaving AEI
>Alastair_Richards: CEINORV 14B OV.RNICE +89 399
>Andrew_Fisher: EIIMOTV B1 .MOTIVE +40 348
#note This is the pivotal point, with six in the bag, one good bingo lane (15I) and two not so good (A1, B1). The deficit of 91 means I have to score solidly and maintain bingo lanes - realistic options are EVICT H11 (kills row 15 but scores well), VOMITO 12H (scores OK, leaves the above lanes free) and my choice, EMOTIVE B1. It empties the bag, giving no scope for Alastair to block both TWS lanes, but clearly relies heavily on a favourable pickup
>Alastair_Richards: DFKOPSY L12 POKY +44 443

#note Phew...
