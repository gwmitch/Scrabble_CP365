>Joshua_Sokol: ?EINORS H6 IRONiES +64 64
#note I played this thinking B(IRONIES) was good and that she wouldn't know that. This is a land mine waiting to explode. I should have looked for a more defensive word, such as ORcEINS at 8F.
>Kay_Patterson: ASSWY 12H .WAYS +22 22
#note I imagined another S.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIKPUU -PUKDIU +0 64
#note I obviously missed KUDU(S) here. I didn't write down what I kept though. Probably an E.
>Kay_Patterson: AQST G6 QAT +29 51
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIRUY -IIYU +0 64
#note This is really looking bad. I think I kept EDR.
>Kay_Patterson: BEEPS 11K BEEP +32 83
#note I was 95% sure she had the s here. This is looking really bad...
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEGHRW 10F WH.G +18 82
#note 10F WE(i)GH? maybe. I'm ready to hook IRONIES next turn.
>Kay_Patterson: HIMST O11 SMITH +48 131
#note Ouch.
>Joshua_Sokol: BDELMOR 5H BOLD +23 105
>Joshua_Sokol: BDELMOR --  -23 82
#note I didn't know BROM(E), but I thought this would draw a challenge. I started doubting right before I hit the clock... It's BRIONIES.
>Kay_Patterson: EIVV 11C VIVE +25 156
>Joshua_Sokol: BDELMOR D10 L.MB +16 98
#note Fishing mode commenced, I'm pretty frustrated with myself. This is not the right play.
>Kay_Patterson: ?CDEKNS J4 DiCKENS +84 240
#note Not sure she knew LIMBI or LIMBA for SNiCKED and SNaCKED. I held this for a really long time. Underscored at 82.
>Joshua_Sokol: DELNORT 14A RETOLD +31 129
#note More frustration.
>Kay_Patterson: OPT A12 PO.T +27 267
>Joshua_Sokol: EILNNNO M8 NON. +5 134
#note More bad desperation fishing.
>Kay_Patterson: AEUX 15F EAUX +36 303
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILNO E11 .IO. +15 149
#note How did I go from bingoing first turn to losing by almost 200?
>Kay_Patterson: ADDEJRU L3 ADJURED +90 393
#note OK, that's enough! :P
>Joshua_Sokol: AACEINR 13C A.. +14 163
#note Yuck.
>Kay_Patterson: FFI 4L .IF +7 400
#note Kay seems to be fond of setting herself up. This is a really good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEINNR 4C CRANNIE. +74 237
>Kay_Patterson: AFIT -  +0 400
#note Challenge. I didn't think it was good either.
>Joshua_Sokol: LLOORTY N2 LO.TY +38 275
>Kay_Patterson: AFIT O4 FIAT +33 433
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGGORZ H1 ZOR. +39 314
#note ZO(N)E and hope for the O I guess. Probably just better to protect spread.
>Kay_Patterson: AAEIIRU 14I AUREI +16 449
#note Champ likes C3 I(C)IER one point better than this.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGGLOU 2D GEOL.GUE +64 378
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGGLOU --  -64 314
#note Probably cause it blocks E(C)LOGUE, but I had something else in mind. I thought it had a good chance of being good. I guess it's just French getting in my way.
