>Will: AHRSTYY 11G TRASHY +46 80
#note Totally could not decide between 7H THY, 11K YAH, and TRASHY...they sim extremely close.
>Ian: CEO 12L ECO +26 76
>Will: AADKNRY 7I KYAR +35 115
#note Another coin flip type move with KAY. An extra point and tile pick to draw and get S? seemed good after ECO.
>Ian: ?ADEERT E4 fEAT.RED +82 158
>Will: AADENNO H11 .ADON +21 136
#note RADON is probably fine, but I don't think I even considered D8 CANON/CANOE/CANOED, which is pretty bad. The score isn't out of hand yet.

>Ian: EGGJO 13C JOGGE. +34 266
>Will: AEEINOV D2 VEENA +26 202
#note Don't think I considered 8L EAVE. Not good.
>Ian: ?EIILTW M2 WILIEsT +79 345
#note I'm sure Ian still finds LEWISITE after EAVE but it's certainly a little harder than WILIEST.
>Will: BEEIMOO 2B MO.IE +24 226
#note OBOE seemed foolhardy.

>Ian: AILNSTU O2 INSULA.T +59 439
>Will: ALNOORW 1A LAW +31 320
#note NAW seems to be better...I guess I threaten a couple outs with FLOOR and ORLONS after picking the F and S.
>Ian: GINOSVZ D12 Z.ON +28 467
>Will: FNOOR 14B FO. +21 341
#note Lazy endgames were a major problem for me - rarely did I have major time pressure. Considering not a lot of spread separated me from third, pretty bad effort on my part.
