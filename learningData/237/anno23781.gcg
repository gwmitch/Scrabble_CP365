#note Eh, not sure of my reasoning for this. In the name of not opening a big scoring hook with EXOTIC I instead played DOTE which turns certain tiles into massive scores on row 6 hooking OX and EM (and closes the board at a small deficit).

#note I considered ZAG for the extra 8 points, but apparently I bingo slightly more after ZAG compared to VEG as well, which is quite surprising to me. With that information ZAG becomes obvious. VIG maximizing my bingo chances is worth a thought too.

#note Major vowel shortage here, so I kept both of mine instead of 6B YOB - also, BY sets up MYC, which could be handy.
