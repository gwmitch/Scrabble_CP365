>Jesse: BLW G6 BL.W +14 14
>Will: AEGHHIX D8 .EIGH +24 52
#note I laid PAX down and then picked it up because it looked to yield big scores...but simulation says PAX yields less than WEIGH or AWEIGH down column D. Weird. However, I totally missed AWEIGH 9F setting up the huge PAX play. I'm not sure that's necessarily best, though, because it would look really weird to Jesse that I would sacrifice so many points to make a volatile spot.
>Jesse: CDIOR 12C R.ODIC +15 29
>Will: ACEHOTX 7B HOAX +37 89
#note I regretted not doing COXA/COAX after I played. Opening the board and keeping the nice ETCH combo helps me both bingo more and score more (just ETH 13C hooking WEIGHT is a great fallback).
>Jesse: FRY H4 FRY +20 49
>Will: CEEETTU 7G .EU +15 104
#note Ugh. My thought process here was - I wish I had an L for LETTUCE. Too bad I don't. Oh, cool, there's a place where I can insert an E to make FRYER. Too bad my longest L words are LEET and LEU. Also, much simpler plays like H12 CUTE/CETE are much better too. 
>Jesse: ?AILSTY B3 TrAS.ILY +73 122
>Will: ACEEOTT A8 TEAT +25 129
#note Tacked on the T for a couple more points and peace of mind about extensions.
>Jesse: ADIQ F10 QA.I +34 156
>Will: ACEEGOR 5H .ACEGOER +72 201
>Jesse: IOVZ O1 VIZO. +54 210
>Will: AENNNOO H10 AN.ONE +24 225
>Jesse: AEU A1 EAU +11 221
>Will: INNOOSU 14B NOUNS +31 256
#note Put down UNIONS and picked it up because I got scared of the M underlapping, but NOUNS can get hit pretty hard too and leaves the gross IO. Although there aren't very many vowels left, UNIONS is certainly the play.
>Jesse: DEEM 15A DEEM +41 262
>Will: DEILOOV E5 VE..L +32 288
#note Flat out missed J2 VOICED.
>Jesse: ABM 4L AMB. +30 292
>Will: ?DGILOO 14H .OODLInG +72 360
#note I was fully aware of the J?G? possibilities after this NOODLING placement but I was under the mistaken idea that the row 11 NOODLING made a bad J spot as well. However, I realize now that I hadn't tracked my own tiles, so I thought two O's were floating when in fact 11H NOODLING was pretty safe from J bombs.
>Jesse: IJS O12 JI.S +60 352
>Will: ADEKNRS 6K RENDS +49 409
#note Crazy draw seals the game. Quackle wants me to play the K for not a lot of points but that seems pretty scary with the score so close.
>Jesse: FINPTTU M11 PFU. +18 370
>Will: AKRT J11 TAR.K +9 418
#note 2 points better to block TINCT with J4 ACT.
>Will:  (INTT) +8 426
