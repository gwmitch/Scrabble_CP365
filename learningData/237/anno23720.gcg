#note Standard equity says to play WUZ in this spot, but WIZ holds FU(Z)E for 60 next turn. He can play there sometimes but idk....? I like this play. 
>Steven_Alexander: OOU O12 OU.O +42 364
#note aaah crap! I didn't think about that possibility too!
>Matt_Canik: EFIJRRU F10 JU. +27 375
#note I figure I'm in really bad shape here but the best-case scenario is that he has the Q and is unable to go 2-and-out because he has to give up his best letters.... I have to hope the Q is on his rack so it's ok to give up the U.... Q says this is my best shot.
>Steven_Alexander: ADIQSST 3A QAD. +28 392
#note It's rather deceptive, but if Steven plays QAT or QIS or QI on the upper M column then I don't think I can go out in two and score enough.
