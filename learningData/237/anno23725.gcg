#note Duck likes ditching the Q at E7 for 11 points. Just over three percent in winning chances, and over 5 points in valuation.

#note tough choice here and I make the wrong one. 2j PREZ is best; it's second in valuation to I11 URB and first in winning percentage. ZEP is 11 percentage points back in wp (79-68), and 15 back in valuation (20-5) after a sim.
H11 ORB is just behind URB.

>Steve: ABILRRS 5B ABRI +23 316
#note 8k BASIL for 40. For some reason I wasn't confident that ZOSTER took an -S, but even so, I never saw the BASIL possibility.
>Elaine: HO N5 OH +29 282
>Steve: LORSSTW 13G WORST +19 335
#note Scary situation with both blanks still unseen.  This wins a sim, significantly.
>Elaine: ?AAAERV J2 VA. +18 300
>Steve: ?ILNRS 10K LoRN +15 350
#note Not very good in terms of point spread, but it wins.
