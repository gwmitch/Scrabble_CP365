#note I'm passing up the bingo in both spots because the Z is unseen and I'm definitely not sticking an E in that position in the 3x3 lane.  My bingo aint going anywhere.

#note I'm ignoring GENTILE because I'm being defensive and stuff.  Over the board, I thought I saw OUTGOING as a 3x3, but I have the last G and it doesn't play anyway.  Even if I don't consider a possible 3x3, GLEETING is still better because it doesn't open any lanes but GENTILE does.

>Tasha: AIKMOTY 15K OMIT +12 471
#note I tracked correctly and figured Richard's best play is 15K OUNCE so I'm going to block that while giving myself in out in more than one spot.  If I'm going to take out his best play AND go out next turn, I have to play OMIT first instead of the numerous plays on row 13.
