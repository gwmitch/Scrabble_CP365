#note The bag was empty, but I still had 8 tiles unseen.  Pool looked like AAEHILS? on my side.  I counted the A's about 20 times and still came up with 2 unseen.  So I thought Matt had two As so was I gonna do something incredibly stupid on this turn.  But then I came to my senses.  If 8 tiles are unseen, I'm OBVIOUSLY mistracking and Matt most likely has AEHILS? on his rack.  I almost played TUX, but I decided to play it absolutely safe.  I wouldn't want him to score over 700 or anything.
