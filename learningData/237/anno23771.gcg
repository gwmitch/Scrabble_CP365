#note Hated to close column K, but couldn't find anything else I liked better.
>Joe: GGIMS F2 MIGGS +25 153
>Will: ABHKOSY 9H BO.Y +29 112
#note SHAKY was tempting, but I wanted to S-hook HOODLUM in a way that opened multiple quadrants if I could.
>Joe: R 6D R.. +18 171
>Will: ?AHKSVX 13G KVAS +31 143
#note After Joe's play, I think changing course was clearly correct here - he's certainly closer to bingoing than I am, so I need to forget about opening for a few turns and try to block/outscore while the board is so bingo-unfriendly. It helps that I have a lot of heavy ammunition for scoring in hand.
>Joe: P 11J .P +24 195
>Will: ?AAEHJX H13 .EX +39 182
#note D10 RAJA setting up the H was tempting, but I score much better with VEX and might get something better than 25 points next turn too.

>Joe: EF 14A EF +22 233
>Will: ??HILTZ A8 gLiTZI.. +75 296
#note Didn't think of KLUTZIER, a clear improvement because it sets up a nice scoring spot for the H at B10.

#note At about this point, our clock died and we had to go hunt for a new one.
>Joe: GNU L6 GNU +18 271
>Will: CIIIRTT B5 TITI +7 330
#note Couldn't quite stomach G1 TITI, but it might not be the worst idea to block the M and I and make a "scoring spot" that actually doesn't offer much. I'm keeping CI to try and pick an N that would basically end the game with CINQ.
>Joe: DE A4 DE +7 278
>Will: CIIORSW L11 OW +15 345
#note Might've misjudged this situation. I think simply playing M2 COIRS or CROWS scores enough to outrun anything Joe can play down column M. Instead, I score much less and may actually allow a couple more bingos to go down. I'm still going for CINQ, but Joe's play of GNU might suggest a slightly increased likelihood that he has at least one of the two remaining Ns.
>Joe: F 10A .F +12 290

#note The play is probably XERIC.
