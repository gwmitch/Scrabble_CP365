#note Considered M9 QAIDS and 14J SERAC, with honorable mention to N10 CASQUE. CASQUE closes the board while allowing Orry to retain tempo by scoring well to the triple, so I discarded it. QAIDS at least doesn't let him whack me in response, and the CER leave is actually pretty decent for hitting bingos down column J hooking FOUR - I didn't really think of that. I think I would do QAIDS if I could do it over. M9 CRED setting up ACRED/QATS is pretty interesting but the low score is tough to stomach and it puts me in a huge hole if Orry has an A himself.

#note This is a bad turn to trust simulation because Orry is going to play so differently from what sim suggests. I was torn between E10 BO and 7F QI. I was concerned that many of the Q plays I could draw after BO down column D required precise two-tile draws on only a 3 tile pick, and most would place a Q out in open space at 8D, which would be a disaster for the board. Of course, QI also helps Orry close things down. QAT at 10E was tempting because I have an I in hand but so many of Orry's responses will score huge and close the board even more afterwards (he could have an I or a play like E10 QUALE or QUELEA). Still not sure on this one.

#note I don't think I can take a score of less than 10 with FLINT or FOUNT here...I need points and a strong draw right away or it won't matter. If Orry blocks all the new lines, maybe I can still draw A? and play with AJAR.

#note I missed G13 TIE - need those extra points. I bingo less, but I win more often when I do.

#note Down to not a lot of time - I'm mostly going for various draws that let me play NEUROM(AS)T.

#note Very nice - I could have ETHICIAN or MINUTIAE, but they would still lose.
