>Jim_Burlant: ARTTTYZ 8H RATTY +24 24
#note Hmmm.  Should have played TATTY.  Thi is runner-up, roughly 3 points down.
>Fran_Silver: EMW 9G MEW +26 26
>Jim_Burlant: EEHITUZ 7I HUE +27 51
#note Best, despite the points given up on the scoreboard to 10F ZEE.  
>Fran_Silver: ?DEKLLN 10B KNoLLED +81 107
#note Best bingo for Fran, and this is winning 67%.  
>Jim_Burlant: BEIOTTZ E9 B.ITZ +32 83
#note Q prefers 6I TOT by not quite 3 points.  Hmmm.  I'd rather score 32 and hope to bingo somewhere on row 6.
>Fran_Silver: ABRT 6F BRAT +22 129
#note Better at 6J for 26, but this worked in Fran's favor.
>Jim_Burlant: EILOSTU C5 OUTLI.ES +60 143
#note Ack!  Too bad I couldn't think of REDO - OUTLIES plays at 11H for 69.
>Fran_Silver: DINT 11H DINT +16 145
>Jim_Burlant: AFGHNOX 8A FA.X +66 209
#note Benefitting from my mistake on the last turn.  This is clearly best and it wins 77%.
>Fran_Silver: AINPV D2 PAVIN +24 169
>Jim_Burlant: CCGHNOR 3C R.NCH +28 237
#note Missed a plethora of good plays here, most of which I didn't know.  H1 CONCHA is the star play. This is very poor.  Of course it didn't occur to me to think of the back O hook.  Fortunately I don't get burned too badly for this. 
>Fran_Silver: D 6B D.. +8 177
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGOOO 2A GOO. +16 253
#note Not remembering the RANCH back hook killed me here.  H1 GOO is obviously the play.  But then again, if I make the right play here, I don't catch the breaks that gift-wrap me the game on the ensuing turns.
>Fran_Silver: ?ADEILO 4G AmIDOLE +69 246
>Fran_Silver: ?ADEILO --  -69 177
#note Good thing for me she couldn't think of mELODIA.
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGNOV K4 COV.. +20 273
#note The legit 7's in her rack are MELODIA, ISOLEAD, OEDIPAL, DIAZOLE, GEOIDAL, and DARIOLE.  I couldn't block all the 7's, but I figured I'd force her to have to make the toughest finds she could make out of her rack:  either OEDIpAL or EcO(C)IDAL.  What I didn't expect was that I would be given another break just as good as the last one.  Against her rack of adeilo?, this play wins 81%.
>Fran_Silver: ?ADEILO 2G ELODIAs +66 243
>Fran_Silver: ?ADEILO --  -66 177
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGNWY 1A AW +29 302
#note My words after I held the play of ELODIAs:  "That is as phony as a 3-dollar bill.  The question is whether I should let you have it."  With YAWN for 53 and YEW for 47 available as comebacks, it was very tempting to let her have the play.  Alas, I felt she was too likely to come back with something even bigger and the game would still be in the range of 30 points.  Better to add more to the lead and force her to find the bingos she is struggling to find.  That said, EGGY A1 or AGENCY 4G would have been much better choices than this. This was autopilot.
>Fran_Silver: ?ADEILO H1 IDOL +29 206
#note "Oh yeah - THAT back hook."
>Jim_Burlant: EEGNQRY 1G Q. +11 313
#note You have got to be kidding me - the 6th time in 6 games I have drawn the Q.  Puh-leez!
>Fran_Silver: AFO F12 OAF +27 233
>Jim_Burlant: EEGNRSY 15A GREENS +31 344
#note Not surprisingly, Q doesn't like this at all, preferring 15C GEYSER.  Why give her a line for an easy 7?  
>Fran_Silver: EP G13 PE +29 262
#note Play incorrectly scored as 28.
>Jim_Burlant: AEEIRUY H14 YE +24 368
#note Another positoin trying to turn lemons into lemonade.  I can't score, no matter how I slice it I can't really defend effectively with this rack... but I can eliminate the synergy problems and take out the triple for 24 points.  Takes a while to percolate to the top of the heap, but this play sims best against an inferrence of e?.
>Fran_Silver: ?EGIRSU 2H .RUGgIES +72 334
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINRU 1N AI +14 382
#note Not sure I have this rack written correctly.    If this is the actual rack, SAURIAN is best.
>Fran_Silver: AJOS L11 SOJA +28 362
#note Hmmm...wondering if a tile was not drawn?  The annotation is accurate but the pool suggests there is another E unseen that Fran never played and I never caught this.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINRU 13J IN.URE +26 408
>Fran_Silver: EEMO 4K .OME +16 378
#note COME was Fran's out play - we must have dropped an E somewhere and not found it.  Final score recorded as 408 - 381.
