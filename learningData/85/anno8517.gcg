#note I had been hoping to land a big blow with EXAMINES, but I was still in fine shape with this play.

#note That bag was looking pretty scary. Possibly VENAE 2I to try for defense.

#note A no-brainer, but unfortunately it tipped the fact that I had a huge rack.
>Conrad: DEEORST 8N E. +9 332
#note Wisely forgoing the bingo, judging that emptying the bag was practically certain to lose. 
>Bing: ?EIIMNS G14 .I +8 355
#note It seemed much too dangerous to bingo now (although it would have in fact worked).
>Conrad: DEORRST N10 OR. +14 346
#note The other main choice is to force the issue with TROD 2H. That would have succeeded beautifully as it turned out.
>Bing: ?BEIMNS D4 MIlNEBS +74 429
#note Ill-considered play. I thought this put me far enough ahead, but there were lots of losing out-bingoes (fORESEEN, REEDieST, etc). It's much safer to take SUB 13G, leaving 1 in the bag.
