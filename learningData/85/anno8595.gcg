#note sweet
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EN I8 EN +8 12
>Matthew_Larocque: EESSUVX J4 VEXES +34 34
#note Either spot is pretty much exactly the same.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: INO 4J .INO +14 26
>Matthew_Larocque: GLPSTUW 3K PUG +24 58
#note I miss a lot of words that end in -UP. This does pretty good sim-wise, but G(E)TUP underneath VINO has the clear advantage.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEINRTW 7B TAWNIER +65 91
#note TINWARE plays for 79, 14 extra points. Could be that NOES is easy to overlook perhaps?
>Matthew_Larocque: ADLSTUW G9 WAULD +25 83
>Matthew_Larocque: ADLSTUW --  -25 58
#note Was thinking of YAULD obviously, Siri didn't hesitate to remove this. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: OTY 8A TOY +25 116
>Matthew_Larocque: ADLSTUW 6C WAUL +29 87
#note That play helped my rack immensely.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ADO 5A ODA +14 130
>Matthew_Larocque: ADHIOST G9 TOADISH +67 154
#note You can resemble a toad, but not a frog. Also, a word I didn't know, double-double T(UN)DISH. 
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AIJL F10 JAIL +59 189
#note yipes
>Matthew_Larocque: AADILRZ A1 DIAZ. +75 229
#note I was able to fire right back though!
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AQ 12D QA.. +28 217
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCILRT 15E BA.T +27 256
#note Damn this turn was tough for me. Word knowledge failed me, not knowing superior plays like C(H)ITAL, C(H)IRAL, ARC(H)IL or LIC(H)T. Not to mention BACIL(LI) for 35. :/
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EF 5I F.E +22 239
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFILRR 13B FRIL..ER +37 293
#note Nailed this play however - It's miles ahead of anything else.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ?EMNNOS N4 SNOwMEN +70 309
>Matthew_Larocque: ACCEIKY 8L CY.A +42 335
#note CY(M)E works too, but doubled Es aren't anything to fret about.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: BL 11E B..L +22 331
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CEEIKM B10 KIE.s +42 377
#note I can't remember what prompted me to burn the blank here, but I must have thought I could continue to outscore him if I didn't let up. MEEK for 29 at 2L sure looks a lot better. My play sims pretty awful and just playing KIE(F) instead ranks near the top of the pack.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DG E5 D..G +12 343
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEMPRU L8 .RUMP +22 399
#note (C)ECUM same spot is favoured over this by a decent margin. I miss these words a lot despite knowing the plural forms (CECA).
>Siri_Tillekeratne: GHU K11 HUG +32 375
>Matthew_Larocque: CEERSTT 3A .CT +10 409
#note So far I've played pretty well for what I'm capable of. But, all it takes to lose a game is for your brain to self destruct for a couple turns. Which is what happened here. I saw the huge hotspot, but wasn't sure if CERE took an S. I assume I didn't know CETES either at the time. Or TERCE, TERCET, CERTES. Basically word knowledge failure. However, despite missing all those, I can still win....
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EIINORV 14J VENIR +40 415
#note If I challenge this nonsense off. No excuses, I didn't even have to think for a moment if this was a word. but I didn't challenge. Why the heck not? I was about to run into overtime and I knew I could win even if it stayed on. Fair enough reasoning. All I have to do is play ROTES 15K and the game is mine. Easy enough right? There's no way I can lose right? I mean I couldn't possibly play a phony word and lose my turn....
>Matthew_Larocque: EEORST O11 OERST +27 436
>Matthew_Larocque: EEORST --  -27 409
#note No I have to do something so unfathomably stupid it makes zero sense and words fail me to try and explain it. OERST isn't even a word, just OERSTED. And my thought process of "he must have thought VENIR was a word, why else would he play such an obvious phony?" was just plain terrible. Even IF this was a valid play, ROTES is a billion times better anyways. Frig...this was so bad that my next game was a disaster and a free win for my opponent.

Unfathomably#... weird
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IO 10B .OI +7 422
>Siri_Tillekeratne:  (EEORST) +12 434
#note -10 for time, though I think I could have safely afforded a bit more time to knock some sense into myself here...
