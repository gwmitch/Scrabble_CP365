>Jim_Burlant: DLLRSXY -DLLXY +0 0
#note Q says 8G DRY is best - really?  Keep 4 consonants including duplicated Ls and a possibly useless X for only 14 pts?  No thanks.
>Michelle_Davis: ACW 8G CAW +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIRSS G8 .IS +6 6
#note Another tough call.  No matter how I slice it I'm telegraphing that I have another S.  IS or SI down the J column score more but threaten to give back way too much.  And turning 3 tiles with AIS or 4 tiles with IRIS didn't feel right.  With LLLLNNNNNNTTTTTT unseen I want to keep AEIRS together at all costs.
>Michelle_Davis: BDEEINR H10 INBRED +38 54
#note Michelle told me her rack after the game. Fortunately for me, she wasn't sure enough about BENDIER to put it down.
>Jim_Burlant: AEINRST 15A STRAINE. +80 86
#note Or 15H DETRAINS.
>Michelle_Davis: IPZ A12 ZIP. +25 79
>Jim_Burlant: DLOPRVW F10 PLOW +26 112
#note Solid play, but not best.  PLOWED 14D is best. This is third-best, roughly 6 (!!) equity points behind.
>Michelle_Davis: IST 12A .ITS +26 105
>Jim_Burlant: ADEORVV 12H .RAVOED +26 138
#note Q prefers B10 VOID by a handful of points - I'd be willing to give up 7 points for something like AERT or AENS, but AERV?  No thanks.  With ?? unseen I'd rather turn the rack, hit the reset button, and try again.
>Michelle_Davis: EMM 13M MEM +25 130
>Jim_Burlant: ADHINTV N8 INVA..D +40 178
#note Best, and it wins 66%.  But things were about to get tougher.
>Michelle_Davis: DENO O6 NODE +26 156
#note Phew.  That could have been worse.
>Jim_Burlant: EEGHNQT -QEG +0 178
#note Totally unnecessary exchange.  I couldn't think of HENGE and didn't like any of the other options because I was blinded by having drawn the  Q for the third straight game.  MEG O13 would have been a decent play.  This?  Stupid.
>Michelle_Davis: IJO J10 JI.O +27 183
>Jim_Burlant: EHKLNNT M6 NTH +14 192
#note Didn't see B10 KNIT, which Q syas is best - looks right.  This is 6 points down.
>Michelle_Davis: CTU L8 CUT +21 204
>Jim_Burlant: EKLNQRY L3 RYKE +24 216
#note Too frazzled by the Q's reappearance to find my best play:  EN(V)Y K10.  This isn't one of the original choices but it's second best, albeit at a huge equity loss to ENVY.
>Michelle_Davis: AELSX C8 EXAL.S +42 246
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNOQY 8A GL.Y +36 252
#note Best, but I'm only winning 35%.
>Michelle_Davis: AAT B6 TA.A +15 261
>Jim_Burlant: AEGNOOQ O13 .OG +21 273
#note D3 GOONEY and OOGENY are the star plays.  Saw OOGENY, but for some inexplicable reason didn't want to play my E - given this pool, totally unfounded...but it turned out to be the right decision.
>Michelle_Davis: BHOT 3K B.OTH +20 281
>Jim_Burlant: AELNOQU A4 QUA +24 297
#note BOTH hurt a lot, as it blocked QUERN/ QUARE for 48.  I didn't like this given that A?? were unseen...and neither did Quackle.  But I felt I didn't have much choice.  Q prefers NOH O1 for 18, which makes sense on an unambitious level: sets up QUEAN on the next turn.  
>Michelle_Davis: EEEE D7 E.E +16 297
#note I don't recall the rest of her rack but she told me post-mortem that she had 4 e's in her rack this turn.  This was the critical position for her - in retrospect 4K EYE might have been much better.  Both of us were shocked by the end draws, and I'll explain in a minute.
>Jim_Burlant: EGLNORU E1 LOUNGER +68 365
#note Relief! Risky to put down the bingo but I didn't know GUENON ^6J, which is best.  This is runner up, but it winds up winning.
>Michelle_Davis: ?EEFIOU 1A FUtI.E +27 324
#note Her best play is FLOOIE 1D.  Both of us were astounded to find blanks in our racks - she thought for sure that, with the way I'd been turning tiles in the early game, I'd landed one or both of the blanks.  I, in turn, was concerned this one was slipping away and was shocked to find my final 5 tiles being AFIR?.
