#note Better at 9E for 67 or 9C for 68.
>Bryan_Pepper: ?ACEENT 7B CANTEEn +64 70
#note Many better choices for Bryan here - 5E CREATINE, 5E ENACTIVE score 86.
>Jim_Burlant: ENNPTUZ 5G UNZ.P +32 97
#note No-brainer best play - nothing else worth consideration.
>Bryan_Pepper: IMNX 4D MINX +35 105
>Jim_Burlant: EEHHNRT 3C HEH +27 124
#note Q doesn't particularly like this, docking me not quite 3 points.  Q prefers the K11 placement.  I wanted a more bingo-friendly board, as I didn't want to have to rely on finding an 8 that might not be there if I didn't draw an S.
>Bryan_Pepper: DEFY K9 DEFY +37 142
>Jim_Burlant: EINRSTT B7 .ITTERNS +74 198
#note Since INTEREST/INSETTER were blocked, this is best.
>Bryan_Pepper: ERU 5C RUE +23 165
>Jim_Burlant: ADLORUW 8A L.DO +24 222
#note Had the right idea, wanting to defend against the easy QI.  However, this was the wrong execution.  LAUD A8 is definitely the play.  I didn't see it.
>Bryan_Pepper: ABF L11 FAB +35 200
>Jim_Burlant: AEGORUW M12 WO +27 249
#note Q wants me to dump the G for 4 more points, but my gut told me he was sitting on an S and I didn't think it was worth the risk of opening up the triple.  My instincts proved right.

#note Thank God for small favors.  Or big ones, in this case. Bryan told me after the game he thought he was putting down littlest and didn't pay enough attention to what he was doing.  But this made my next move more problematic.  He's got any number of 7's down the N column as well as 8's on rows 11 or 12.  Given the probable sequence of events I felt my best bet was to forego building a bingo rack.  Instead, I opted to turn as much of the rack as I could; with luck I could land a goodie like the case S or if I was really lucky, a power 5 like JAKES that could play at L1.  Q agrees in principle, preferring REGAUGE by quite a bit.  I saw  REGAUGE but wasn't sure enough to put it down.
>Bryan_Pepper: ?EILSTT N6 LITTErS +70 270
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGJKR 8L KA.A +39 306
#note Best, despite the points given up to H10 JAEGER, but it's close - this wins by roughly 3 points, and Q says I'm winning 67%.
>Bryan_Pepper: PY 7M Y.P +25 295
>Jim_Burlant: EGIJRVW H10 VI.WER +36 342
#note The winner is a power word I rarely find, REJIG.  This is a respectable second.
>Bryan_Pepper: IMV 9E VIM +19 314
>Jim_Burlant: AEJ K3 JA.E +15 357
#note The one crucial rack I foreget to write down, and I really outsmarted myself here.  I felt like he was trying to set up something like QUAGS L1, and I got paranoid about blocking that.  I thought this was smart at the time, but his next play shows me otherwise.
>Bryan_Pepper: BGOS L2 BOGS +46 360
#note Completely deserved.
>Jim_Burlant: ACDDGQT M1 QAT +48 405
#note Championship player says 2 plays win 100%:  G11 QUAD, and this.  I didn't see the first; my feeling about this one was that, worst casing it, I play for 48 and he comes back on row 1 with the obvious QUA, and that would leave me row 14 to dump enough of this rack to seal the win away.

#note Couldn't think of CADGED.
