#note I basically played this whole game distraught over the massive botch that was my previous game; causing me to fail very badly. Anyways, there's no reason to play short with this mediocre rack, need to get some turnover and play begot or begone or something like that.
>Donna_Carruthers: AE G8 .AE +8 24
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEGLNT G3 GLEE +11 22
#note I assume TAKIN wasn't a learned word yet, but it's the only good thing with this rack and this position.
>Donna_Carruthers: ?GIOOST I3 TOOlI.GS +62 86
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINRTU H10 NEURIC +30 52
#note Not a valid word, but guess it sounded good enough to her. It still sims kind of meh despite scoring better than anything valid. Dumps too many good letters I guess? 30 points is 30 points though and I don't have a blank or an s or anything so big deal.

>Matthew_Larocque: AAEILST 6I .A +3 81
#note Sinking back into bad habits. I missed the 9 letter word, and figured TISALE was a good fishing rack. Sadly it does not make a 7 using another T. Amazingly this sims right near the top though.
>Donna_Carruthers: EJO H1 JOE +34 185
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILSTT 15C TESTI.AL +71 152
#note LOL there's desperate and then there's.... whatever this was, I know I'm trailing by 100 points vs the lowest rated player in the division, but really. Thankfully my opponent must have brain farted too because she actually let me have 71 points for a common english word that isn't even spelled right, and another word that most everyone would assume does not take an S hook. Good grief.
>Donna_Carruthers: VVW -VVW +0 185
>Matthew_Larocque: DDOPRSU K2 PROUD +19 171
#note Pride was not among my thoughts on this day, that's for sure! POD E5 is an alternate play.
>Donna_Carruthers: ENQRS 12G Q.ERNS +30 215
>Matthew_Larocque: DHOOS E4 HOOD +24 195
#note Didn't write all of this one down... can't really say much
>Donna_Carruthers: AVW D3 VAW +33 248
>Matthew_Larocque: AGHLLSV 13L HALL +19 214
#note VA(N)G that's a safer play. Quackle also says dumping most of these letters is probably in my best interest.
>Donna_Carruthers: DI O13 .ID +12 260
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGNOSV M13 .VO +6 220
#note Yikes, what was my plan with this play? At this point I might as well grab 20-25 points and keep it close, EF is still hanging around if I luck into a bingo ending in R or D.
>Donna_Carruthers: NY 15L Y.N. +12 272
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGNRSU 2K .UNG +14 234
#note Setting up my S, Quackle wants me to use it up for 22 by playing FU(N)S/S(HALL).
>Donna_Carruthers: AM 1N AM +15 287
>Matthew_Larocque: BEFIMRS -FMB +0 234
#note With what's left in the bag, there's a half decent chance I might draw some bingo stem word that can hook EF. But, Quackle vomits on my choice here. It still likes FI(N)S for 22, and there's BIM(AH) or (O)MBRE too but I didn't know about them.
>Donna_Carruthers: ?ADENTT C6 TAuNTED +66 353
#note Welp epic low scoring game is very likely at this point
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIIRST 4C R.. +6 240
#note I think I stopped thinking now
>Donna_Carruthers: AZ 14B ZA +24 377
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIIRST 4K .TIC +12 252
#note Hey (AKIN)ETIC. That might have given meaning to this otherwise weak and painful game.
>Donna_Carruthers: BEFIMRY 9I .RIMY +15 392
>Matthew_Larocque: EIRS K11 I.S +14 266
#note why did I delay this misery....!
>Donna_Carruthers: BEF 8A FE. +15 407
>Matthew_Larocque: ER L7 RE. +6 272
#note RE(V)
>Matthew_Larocque:  (B) +6 278
#note Plus a bunch of points deducted from the timer. EXCELLENT

I somewhat made up for this by having a good showing in the main event - granted not without some fumbled games, but a good showing nonetheless.
