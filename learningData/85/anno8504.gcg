>Chris_May: GILMNOU H4 MOGUL +22 22
#note Chris says he wasn't sure enough of GONIUM here, but MOGUL may be better (retaining the -ING possibility). MOU is worth a look for its handy leave, despite a poor score.
>Naween_Fernando: EGGIKLR 7G R.GLIKE +16 16
#note The board is not sympathic to this rack, simulation throwing up such unappealing options as MIGGLE, GIG I7 or KEG G3. Naween spends several minutes here, and in the end opts for a turnover tactic.
>Chris_May: ADEINNU J2 UNNAI.ED +63 85
#note The only bingo.
>Naween_Fernando: AGOSTUZ M1 OUTGAZ.S +86 102
#note Ditto.
>Chris_May: BDEIQTT 2L Q.IT +26 111
#note Normally it is best to shed the Q as quickly as possible, and that holds true here (with a preference for undoubling the T) although it opens the TWS lane. BOTT is the best play at 1L, but you are left with an albatross around your neck.
>Naween_Fernando: EEHIIRT O1 I.HER +27 129
#note A strong knowledge of fives is helpful here, Naween's play scoring well and leaving an acceptable EIR. The sim slightly favours NEIGH 4J, probably too risky in a game situation.
>Chris_May: BDETTWY 5G B.W.T +20 131
#note Best score here is from YEW K3 (35), but Chris makes the call to dump some incompatible consonants instead. It's a good judgement, BOWAT equal with YEW in the sim despite netting 15 fewer.
>Naween_Fernando: CEEIORV G7 .EVOICE +19 148
#note Naween was set to play OVERMINE before it was blocked (note the O- front hook to VERMINED). I quite like EVO K9 here, leaving an E hook with a pleasant CEIR to draw to. Naween is on the turnover trail again, a fair call in the circumstances.
>Chris_May: ABDEITY 14B BAITED +36 167
#note Chris wasn't sure of BAYTED, which looks best. The I leave shouldn't be problematic with only three to come.
>Naween_Fernando: ACDFIRV 15A FARD +41 189
#note There's a very cute 51-point front-extension available on row 8 (see end). Naween's choice looks solid; the alternative to scoring in row 15 is to dump the bad tiles, e.g. VIFDA C10, but that doesn't earn enough. 
>Chris_May: ?ANNOUY 13A NOYAU +39 206
#note FARD plays into Chris's hands, simply adding a few more points to what was already his standout play. NOY in the same spot runs second in the sim.
>Naween_Fernando: CEINOSV 11G .NVOICES +76 265
#note One bingo on offer, and Naween picks the more defensive position, minimising floaters.
>Chris_May: ??AHILN 13G .xHALINg +76 282
#note Clearly wise to take the bingo here, with openings fast disappearing. Chris's EXHALING matches ETHNICAL for score, with ELAPHINE or HASSLING also available (and inferior)
>Naween_Fernando: ADFOPRT A8 PARDO. +30 295
#note Simulation goes for DOF 14J ahead of Naween's better score. I'm not convinced by DOF, though PARDON is probably more vulnerable to bingos.
>Chris_May: EEJPSTW B7 JEW +22 304
#note Chris was unhappy with this play in retrospect, calling it a game-losing mistake (because the alternative that he overlooked, JEWEL, is much harder to deal with from Naween's viewpoint). JEWEL does look strong, opening up an E floater while leaving column B intact; bolder players might like the temerous JOE 10F, leaving the SJOE hook available.
>Naween_Fernando: AEFLOTY C4 FOLATE +33 328
#note Naween was conscious of the bingo threat in the west, putting an end to it with this splendid 6. The alternative FEATLY at C5 scores more but spends the Y, possibly useful at J14. The move also leaves just three in the bag at a critical point, earning a lead that may be enough to counter X plays - especially as AX at J14 would allow a likely -E hook, and placing the X at D5 would be vulnerable to OXY.
>Chris_May: EEIPRST 7B ..P +12 316
#note Chris is now forced to make an opening, PESTIER and RESPITE having no home, but a win looks to be a distant prospect. The unseen tiles (AEMNORSXY) are powerful, but dumping just one tile is pretty easy to overcome (options include FE 4C, EEL 8F, Chris's JAP and maybe HE I13). Two-tile plays empty the bag, meaning Naween has full knowledge, but some are relatively tricky to address. Options include RE D3 or B3, nice with the P- hook; or PE in the same locations, relying on a pickup of A and/or O. Hard to say which is best against a resourceful opponent.
>Naween_Fernando: EMNRSXY E5 NYS +25 353
#note Quackle's static evaluator foolishly thinks EX 14I is best, but with a glaring opening up top, it is imperative to prevent bingos from AEEIORST (any of AERIEST, EROTISE, ETAERIO, OARIEST, OTARIES, ROSEATE or SERIATE would work). Pretty much anything that hooks JAP will work, or various overlaps involving FY. Most remunerative seem to be NYS D3 or MONY 5B, and Naween's NYS E5 is equally efficacious. 
>Chris_May: EEIORST 14J ROSE +16 332
#note Chris must merely play out in two to minimise the loss.
>Naween_Fernando: AEMRX 15H AXE +33 386
>Chris_May: EIT D2 TIE +16 348
>Chris_May:  (MR) +8 356
