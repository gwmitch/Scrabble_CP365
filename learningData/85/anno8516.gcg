#note yuck! i think the right play is to exchange again.
>judy: ELOPRSY L4 LEPROSY +90 104
#note this was misscored as 88!
>cesar: ADEEEST 4G TEASE.ED +60 82
#note "this sucks" i muttered... oh wait i have a word!
>judy: ACHLNRU 5K H.N +24 128
#note judy later told me she was extremely close to CHECHAKO depending on what letter i put out (!!!)
>cesar: INNOPSW 3M WON +27 109
#note even though there's 8 i's and 4 o's unseen won is still better than win. the O must really suck.
>judy: CHMR I2 CH.RM +16 144
>cesar: AEINPRS 10C RAPINES +70 179
#note jesus christ i need to start studying again like immediately. PANIERS cesar! (although after 1000 iterations rapines is barely on top anyway...)
>judy: CKT D9 T.CK +20 164
>cesar: ?DEIIOV 3A OVIcIDE +75 254
#note if i could inference consonants maybe invoiced would come out on top.
>judy: ENX 8L .XEN +33 197
>cesar: AEFITUU B2 U.EA +14 268
#note fuci 2g or d1. i normally hate defense, but i didn't want the triple to stay open that long (-6.5)
>judy: AFILNQT 4A F. +18 215
>cesar: EFIRTUW O1 FU. +18 286
#note fuci again.. or wiftier e2! wiftier is likely the right play. why am i fishing? (-0.5)
>judy: BB E2 B.B +7 222
>cesar: ADEIRTW 7L .AW +22 308
#note ugh! why am i fishing and blocking a spot simultaneously! d4 caw has to be worse though. the star play here is R(EME)DIATE.. i wish i didn't suck. (-2.5)
>judy: NU J6 UN +10 232
>cesar: ADEEIRT H7 R...DIATE +39 347
#note seriously though, maybe 11B RECITE is better with all she's been telegraphing...
>judy: ?GILNTZ 13F Te.ZLING +104 336
>cesar: AAEGISY 8A YEAS +36 383
#note i thought of 13B GAY but it seemed wiser to take the points. i'm aware plays like this sim poorly. it would have been a slam dunk if GAY still left the S open.. (-7.5)
>judy: ADILORT 15B TAILOR.D +60 396
>cesar: AAGIILR 12K LAARI +21 404
#note ok, so i found the only play that wins here, but...
>judy: IOOQTU B11 QUOI. +28 424
#note ...
>cesar: EGI 2E .IG +17 421
#note somehow, judy accidentally underdrew after tailored, picking just 6. i didn't notice and had like 30 seconds left and thought i had mistracked, because why was there still one in the bag -- it was very confusing. i ended up picking the E and being unable to go out with it!! :(
>judy: OT 9N TO +10 434
>judy:  (E) +2 436
#note that hasn't happened to me before. we called the director and in the rulebook it basically said if i didn't catch the underdraw the game keeps going. (although, apparently, if i had played LAARI and told her she forgot to draw the last tile, before i drew it, it still would be my tile because i had already made the play, according to the rule?!?) she felt bad at the end.. i bet it will come out that at the end of the year she'll beat me by one game to win club.
