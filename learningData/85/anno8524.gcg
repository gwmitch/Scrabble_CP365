>Paul_Thornton: BHOT 8G BOTH +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: AAENNUY K8 YUAN +27 27
#note Best - 7H placement gives up 3 equity.
>Paul_Thornton: ?DEEIIN G3 INEDI.lE +62 80
#note 11E INDIGENE is Paul's best bingo, which scores 66.  This is a 3-point runner up.
>Jim_Burlant: ADEILNR 4F I.LANDER +70 97
#note Whoops - 4C placement scores 72.
>Paul_Thornton: GHO J10 HOG +30 110
>Jim_Burlant: AKLMSVX 10D MAK. +20 117
#note No idea what to do in this position. 10F VEX 21 is apparently best.  I didn't want to sacrifice the S so quickly, which ruled out plays like N2 MASK and N1 KVAS.
>Paul_Thornton: AILRRU E7 RUR.L +10 120
#note Critical decision by Paul.  No matter what he put down, I was going to hit something for at least 30 with the X, but was still going to be saddled with the V.  He initially put down LIRA 11C, but pulled it up.   This choice allowed me to go on a run of scoring he couldn't match.  11G URARI and 11A URIAL are apparently Paul's best plays here, though URARI is certainly dangrous given the front O hook.
>Jim_Burlant: DILOSVX D6 VOX +40 157
#note No-brainer - this is best, nothing else even worth considering.  And from here on I'm off to the races.
>Paul_Thornton: ORTW L10 WORT +26 146
>Jim_Burlant: DEILOST 6G .ELTOIDS +64 221
#note The only playable bingo, it wins 84%.
>Paul_Thornton: IJ I3 J.I. +19 165
>Jim_Burlant: ABCENPY 3L PACY +30 251
#note Best in terms of win percentage but 3L BEY has higher valuation.    I'm winning 87%.
>Paul_Thornton: AG O1 GA. +21 186
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEINV 2J VIA +19 270
#note I don't have a good block on row 13 (VIG is too easy for him to extend to 15H and create all sorts of lanes) and don't have a good block down the N column.  However, I can dump my V and shut down row 1.  Quackle agrees with me - this is best.
>Paul_Thornton: ET D10 .ET +12 198
>Jim_Burlant: ABCDEEN 13C CANED +26 296
#note Hmmm.  Q prefers BEANED 13B by a few points - why open that much more up?  Now BANED would have been better than this due to leave reasons - I didn't think of it.
>Paul_Thornton: FZ F12 F.Z +35 233
>Jim_Burlant: BELMORS 3C OBEL. +16 312
#note Decent, not great, choice.  3B EMBOLI wins.  14J BESOM scores 38 but is reckless given my lead.
>Paul_Thornton: I D3 .I +8 241
>Jim_Burlant: AMQRSTW 14I QATS +23 335
#note Q prefers I11 MAW.  Pfft. I'd rather kill the board and limit his bingo options to airballs down the N column which will have to give me something back either at O8 or O15.
>Paul_Thornton: FIT 15H FIT +31 272
>Jim_Burlant: AIMOPRW 5N OW +7 342
#note Q doesn't particularly like this, preferring 2C plays like WOP or MOW, but this gets the job done and forces Paul to open.  And it certainly worked out well for me.
>Paul_Thornton: ENU M6 .UNE +7 279
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIMPR N9 RAMPIkE +76 418
#note And if I'd taken long enough to find it, I'd have found EMPORIA for 88.  Oh well, the game is clinched regardless.
