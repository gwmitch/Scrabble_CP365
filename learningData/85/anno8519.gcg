#note I liked this play, because it looked conducive for board-closing. He probably won't let me close it more so easily, but I do have my good friend the C to help me out. Also, Dave Johnson is more of a closed player, which could be helpful.

#note Didn't see much I could do to destroy his nice opening, so I closed the eight lanes and planned to close the seven lane next turn if he didn't bingo. If he bingos, I'm still up usually.

#note This seemed fine, as I couldn't see any bingos for him in the pool. DRIBS might be a tad better, though.
