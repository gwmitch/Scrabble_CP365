#note i didn't want to have to worry about the hotspot with K10 ADIEU. 9H NISI is another close choice. (-1)

#note i correctly deduced that FANOS would be better than a bingo to the i here, so i didn't look for it (CASEFIED).

#note this isn't THAT much worse, but escalope is the bingo.. oops :( MAE 13K looks great too. (-8)

#note sheesh it fits at L9 for 20 more.. (prating)
>cesar: ?ACEEOS N1 CAsEOSE +83 359
#note i was happy i found this; it seems slightly winninger than acerose/acetose.

>cesar: EILORUZ A8 .REZ +31 390
#note i was low on time but concentrated and found prez. noticed i only had one out spot. looked for other end game combinations but everything seemed to lose. then i thought, why not try flipping the plays? LOUIE first, but then i thought "there's no spot for ERZ". STUPID. i deserve to lose this game. i told david "it doesn't matter that i won it" (-100%) LOUIE now is the only winning play.
>bruce: AFGOR N9 OF +28 399
#note luckily, he didn't see my out play
>cesar: ILOU 5A LOUI. +7 397
#note i still had like two minutes left that i could have used on the endgame, but i thought i would need them if he blocked louie. he said he could have easily done RAGE (there's no way for me to win then)
