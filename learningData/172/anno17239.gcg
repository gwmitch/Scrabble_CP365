>Reid: ?EEEIRT H7 RETIE +10 10
#note RETIREE at 8G (70.19%) and 8C (69.95%) are top two. EREMITE (69.77%) at 8D is #3. This is another headshaking mistake. While entering my rack in Quackle, I immediately see EREMITE. TEENIER and EERIEST are also avilable. My play is 53 based on all possible choices.
>Ted_Rosen: CDINW 11D WINC.D +24 24
>Reid: ?EELMNY 12C YEN +24 34
#note AMYLENE at G3  (66.63%) and UNMEETLY at 9C (65.41%) are the top 2. AMYLENE at I1 (64.8%) is #3. MYELINE is also available. I had considered MYELINE but coudn't remember if only MYELIN was valid. YEN is #5 (63.88%).
>Ted_Rosen: AFN 13B FAN +28 52
>Reid: ?EILMNV 12I EVIL +17 51
#note My play is #4 (57.12%). EM at 14B (60.73%). YAM at C12 (52.8%), and VINE (57.17%) at E10 are the top 3. While EM is the highest scoring, I don't like the weak defensive position. YAM must sim high for balancing reasons, I think it's a poor choice. I like VINE best.
>Ted_Rosen: INZ 13G ZIN +28 80
>Reid: ?AIMNOR 8A ROMANIs. +80 131
#note IGNORAMI at K5 (69.09%) is #1. My play (67.68%) is #2. ROMANIZE (67.43%) is #3. Other bingos composed the rest of the top 15.
>Ted_Rosen: MORU E4 MOUR. +14 94
>Reid: ABDGJOT D1 JOTA +46 177
#note JABOT (83.62%) is #1. JAG at 14A (79.62%) and JOG at D3 (78.48%) round out the top 3. JATO (78.28%) is#4 and my play is #5 (78.10%)
>Ted_Rosen: ABEIOSS M8 ABIOSES +82 176
>Reid: BDGHLOR 8L H.RD +36 213
#note #1 play. GARB and BALD are #2 and #3 respectively.
>Ted_Rosen: AORW 1D .OWAR +45 221
>Reid: ABGILOT B1 OBLIGAT. +76 289
#note #1  play.
>Ted_Rosen: IO C2 OI +15 236
#note Nice little balance and block play.
>Reid: ?ADEPPT I2 TrAPPED +76 365
#note PUPATEd (76.8%) is #1, APP at F4 (70.5%) is #3. My play is #2 (75.8%).
>Ted_Rosen: LLU 6I .ULL +8 244
#note This may have been a balance play, otherwise, I don't see why PULL at 5I wasn't played.
>Reid: CEOSUVY 14J YOU.E +32 397
#note According to Quackle 5 min championship player, COVEYS at M1 (99.97%) is #1, SCOUSE at 14I (99.96%) and CUSSO at 14J are tied for #2, VOYEUR at N3 is #3 (99.95%). Quackle likes the points here, I went for points too, but I wanted to keep my ess for a possible bingo. VOYEUR balances well and blocks but is a little too low in scoring. YOUSE is #2 based on valuations from all plays, although it opens up a triple lane.
>Ted_Rosen: EGK 14A KEG +33 277
>Reid: ACEHSUV 15A AH +42 439
#note #1 play.
>Ted_Rosen: DEINX 15G INDEX +53 330

>Reid: FT 4H F.T +10 478
#note FET at N13 and EFT at 13M are tied for #1, FAT is #2.
>Reid:  (EESG) +10 488
#note 10 of 12 plays in the top 5. 7 of 12 in the top 2. Unfortunately, I misesd two bingos to start the game. I got a little lucky this game. Overall I give myself a C+.
