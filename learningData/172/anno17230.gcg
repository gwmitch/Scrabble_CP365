#note At least I didn't whiff on this. E3 WH(E)RVE is wherve considering. Puntastic!

#note V(A)LLATE, 3G. That's new! I didn't consider fishing here with L(A)V and I missed T(WE)LVE. VAL(E)T looks better than this too. This was an intermediate play. Perhaps fishing is correct.

#note this makes my previous play worse.

#note Here's another mistaken play. I didn't want to play MONEY at this spot because I had none of the S?? that pluralized it. I basically jumped on this because it scores and keeps a very very flexible leave. The only other thing considered here was YEOMEN C2. I missed a star play of ETYMON at that same spot, 14F ENEMY, and an incredible TEENY(BOP) at B1! 11J MOTEY could be an alternative. I wanted to get rid of (PIANO)S and the (NO) lanes in PIANO, but I think taking out lane C is a better idea now that I think about it, since the lanes I'm blocking give me chances at coming back whereas lane C does not. In any case Michael may have challenged! Notable cool overlaps that don't seem worth the risk are 14E TONEME and ENEMY.

#note lol, and he didn't know this spelling either. 
>Josh: ACELMRR N10 C.MAR +36 286
#note I would have played C(Y)MAE against anyone else, but I played this because even though I was mostly sure it took an S, he doesn't know that and that's leverage. He might even challenge. I should have considered what could have happened next.

#note this is why I'm posting this game. What in the hell do I do? I saw my bingo, LIQ(U)EURS, but that must not be right, because as well as the fact that the E at M15 looks just as if not more dangerous that the U at H1 given the pool, I am creating two more lanes with (RS) in LIQUEURS. After checking, there are 87 bingos through the U with the unseen pool, probably half of which Michael knows, so let's say 50 words. Ending in E, there are 350, and Michael probably knows around half as well, so almost 200. Therefore, given this factor, it must be correct to block the E over the U. Emptying the bag like I did though, I'm not sure. I thought that I shouldn't give Michael another chance at something by leaving 1, and that hoping for a counterbingo (as outscoring seemed impossible otherwise) was futile. Also, unfortunately, there is also 7I to worry about, and there are 190 7s that play there starting in S, and 8 starting in Y. 

In short, many factors seemed to render my emptying the bag argument even stronger, since playing 5 tiles at 15H still leaves Michael two decent spots to fish off a tile for if need be. 

There are a few more important factors to be considered. I could fish for something myself, but that's really unreliable, and I could try and infer something from RAJ. But there's really nothing I can infer, is there? RAJ would be played with so many racks. I guess there's something to be said about playing RISQU(E) or SQUIR(E) and hoping for one blank and therefore a chance to strike back. Anyways, turns out I had no chance.
