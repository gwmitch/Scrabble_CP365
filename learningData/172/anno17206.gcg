>Matt_Canik: ?AAEGMU 8F GAUM +14 14
#note Q prefers AGUE by almost a full point here. It also likes GAUM in the other placement, which makes very little sense to me since the M is so condusive to overlaps and it takes an S. Heh. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEILRTY 9H TEARILY +69 69
>Matt_Canik: ?AAENUW K4 UNAWA.Es +90 104
#note Well that was extremely fortunate.

>Matt_Canik: CEINORT 6H CRE.TION +64 168
#note Well that was extremely fortunate too. (G)ERONTIC is one more. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EEINORS F4 ERIN.OES +63 160
>Matt_Canik: AKOTTTU 4C TAK.OUT +24 192
#note OUT(S)KAT(Es) is a hell of a lot prettier than this, but they score and keep the same. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: DILV M3 LIV.D +22 182
>Matt_Canik: BEIIQST N2 QI +24 216
#note Geoff's odds of having an I here are pretty low (my Poisson approximation showed him at somewhere between 35-40%! Thanks Adam!) so I decided to try and set up my second I up here while also blocking some big plays using the N in creation.

Q has this winning a sim. I feel so smart!

#note Later in the game, Geoff really started kicking himself for not playing MOuRNED at C8 for 5 fewer points. I don't really know how to analyze the situation, though Quackle agrees with his choice on a 2-ply sim by about 2 points. Thoughts?
