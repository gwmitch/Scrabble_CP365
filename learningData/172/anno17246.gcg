#note This choice is terrible statically but it fares very well in the sim.  After a thousand iterations the sim is still a virtual dead heat between this or a word I didn't know, NOVELLE, which plays at E7 and scores 20.

#note FAIL. It was only several turns later that possible front extensions to AVOWED occurred to me.  Between my annoyance at drawing a U the instant I threw the Q back and drawing this garbage, I was so fixated on grooming the rack that I never noticed the obivious extension, UN(AVOWED).  Pathetic.
>Chris_Cree: ?EFGLOR C6 LE.pFROG +74 133
#note Terrific find!  
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEHPT D3 EPHA +20 38
#note Couldn't think of ETAPE, which plays both at B11 and B2; that would have been better to unload the extra E.  This is so-so.
>Chris_Cree: JT 12B J.T +20 153
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIKLT 5D .IKE +22 60
#note I had to get one right some time.  This is best, but it's bleak - 7-1/2% to win at this point.
>Chris_Cree: GINRS H1 GRINS +33 186
>Jim_Burlant: EILLNST 1H .ILLNETS +80 140
#note Best bingo, and I've increased my chances to 17%.
>Chris_Cree: AMR F2 MAR. +16 202
>Jim_Burlant: ABCDIOU C2 ABO +22 162
#note Weak.  Saw CUB C1 and and didn't like it (a) because of the unseen H and Y, and (b) the vowel overloaded leave.  Then saw this.  Apparently, B2 COBIA is best, but this worked out.  Sort of.

#note Cute play, but not quite right according to the duck.  At the time, I figured that, if I turned the rack, anything he used to extend the C would give me bingo lanes. The sim indicates that I played in the right place but I needed to keep the C and hook FUNDI myself.   Makes sense given the unseen Q and Z.   Regardless, pulling the blank has increased my winning chances to 26% from the 15% they were on the last turn.

>Jim_Burlant: ?AILOTU O1 .OLATIUm +74 252
#note Bingoes all over the place, but nothing is available on row 15.  Other options are TUTORIAL on row 13 or down the N column, J4 OUTSAIL, and TROUPIAL on row 11.  This is best, but I'm still in the hole - 31% to win.
>Chris_Cree: OY 6I OY +18 270
>Jim_Burlant: ABDENOX N5 AX +52 304
#note What an awesome post-bingo draw!!!  For the first time this game, I'm in the driver's seat - 60% to win if the duck is to be believed.
>Chris_Cree: ACEERST 12H .CERATES +72 342
#note Aaaargh!!!!  I always confuse which of the ACERATE/ACIERATE pair takes the back S and D.  He put this down and I held it, as it blocked my intended OBTAINED bingo.  I thought about it, saw that he had a bunch of other bingoes for comparable points and outsmarted myself, thinking he had to be trying to draw the challenge.  Between that and my having a comeback that brought me within striking distance, I opted to not risk the win.  Too bad, as I needed to take this off and put my own bingo down before he would have replied with RETRACES.  
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEINO B12 .AB +27 331
#note Apparentely, I should be turning as many tiles as I can and play M7 BANDITO for 28. I dunno - I don't think there are as many I's in the bag as Quackle does.  At any rate, this isn't looking good - 21% to win.
>Chris_Cree: EZ 14F ZE. +32 374
>Jim_Burlant: DEIINOQ O10 QI. +12 343
#note It's official - with the Q coming back from the dead at the wrong time, I'm toast. 
>Chris_Cree: HIM 13L HIM +29 403
>Jim_Burlant: DEINOOV K7 VOIDE. +20 363
#note Or DEVOIR in the same location.  Whatever, it's a moot point. 
>Chris_Cree: EINNRTU 14J UNITER +35 438
>Jim_Burlant: NOS 15B SON +17 380
#note Poorly played on my end.  Missing UNAVOWED was horrendous, EPHA was weak, ABO I had no clue what to do, and I then overthought things when he put down ACERATES*, costing myself the win.  If I challenge that off, we trade bingos, but I'm in the driver's seat and still leading by 44 points after he replies with RETRACES.  Instead, I threw the win away.
