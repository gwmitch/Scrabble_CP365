>Jim_Burlant: ACDEOOT 8D COATED +24 24
#note Any number of ways I could go with this.  I considered going short with COO but, if I was going to give up a lot of points on the scoreboard, the board position/vowel placement scared me away from it.  I opted for COATED instead of COOED due to vowel placement.  It takes a few hundred iteratons before the sim starts to sort out:  this is best.
>Chris_Cree: BNU 7F BUN +15 15
>Jim_Burlant: ?INNORY D8 .RONY +20 44
#note FAIL.  I didn't know NONLYRIC and whiffed on NONDAIRY I5.  The only thing I saw was CRONYING*, which I was sure was phony.  If you whiff on the bingos, this is safer than CORNY in the same location, which is why I passed on CRONY.  In retrospect, I wish I'd played CORNY.
>Chris_Cree: GKOW 6G GOWK +29 44
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEFINU E10 FE +19 63
#note Hit the clock and realized the mistake.  I was being way too protective of my E and leaving myself too vowel heavy with this.  FEE E10 needed to be the play.
>Chris_Cree: EFZ F10 FEZ +43 87
#note And, as if my own self-chastising wasn't enough, he hit me with this, all due to my mistake on the previous turn:
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEINOU -IOU +0 63
#note Frustration - there is no reason to exchange here.  Interestingly enough, while this isn't one of the original kibbitzer options, it sims in the top third of plays.  50% to win.  Best is apparently 12C OYEZ 22.
>Chris_Cree: AADJLOX -AADJL +0 87
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAENST K6 SANTErA +75 138
#note Or SEALANT or SEAWANT.  70%  to win.
>Chris_Cree: AEI G12 AI +14 101
#note Chris put down plays like TIE K9 before pulling them up and settling on this.
>Jim_Burlant: ILMNRUV 10J V.LUM +24 162
#note A little uneasy about not defending the easy hook he's opened up, but there's not much I can do about it with this rack.  Q agrees - this is best.  74% to win.
>Chris_Cree: ?EEEILT 14B EELIEsT +68 169
#note Best bingo for Chris, but he's still only 41% to win in a short sim.
>Jim_Burlant: HIINRTV L12 HINT +26 188
#note I missed a really cool extension here that would have changed the trajectory of this game:  H1 INTHRONE scores 45.  This sims as the bronze medalist but that's only because INTHRONE is the only good option I've got and everything else is vastly inferior.  INTHRONE wins 57% and this wins 47.
>Chris_Cree: OPSW 15K S.OWP +30 199
>Jim_Burlant: IIRUUVY 13L .VY +18 206
#note Terrible draw, and an even worse play.  His play of STOWP absolutely killed me, as I had figured him to either take out 15H or O15, but not both of them.  The play I never saw was VINY 14J since I was just too shocked that he managed to kill both of 15H and O15.  As for why I opted to play through this garbage with IVY instead of exchanging:  my thinking was that the  board was shutting down rapidly and if I took the time to exchange, he probably scored well.  And if the exchange went well, I'd have probably broken up a rack for cheap. Most of the rack killers are gone from this pool, so I figured that I might as well try to grind.  VINY would have been good.  This is atrocious.
>Chris_Cree: DEH 15A EDH +29 228
>Jim_Burlant: IIJNRUU 14J JU. +28 234
#note This is why you need to stay calm - I was just miffed that for the second straight turn his garbage took away what I'd been intending to do, and board blindness set in.  B10 JURIED does a much better job clearing out this crap and doesn't leave him room to make the setup play he made later. The B column didn't register with me as having any plays available.
>Chris_Cree: PS H12 PS. +27 255
>Jim_Burlant: IIINRUX 9M XU +38 272
#note I'd rather be lucky than good.  I'm still only 40% to win with this.
>Chris_Cree: GL N7 GL.. +7 262
>Jim_Burlant: AIIINOR O5 NAOI +21 293
#note I debated whether to play OI or this.  OI leaves things tighter, but I also thought that the turnover would be helpful since there were still AAAAIII unseen and I needed to do something about these racks.  Q agrees with me - this is best.  And, despite my horrendous play to this point, I'm back to 53% winning chances.
>Chris_Cree: ET C9 ET +16 278
>Jim_Burlant: AACDIIR M2 CARDIA +25 318
#note I figured that, since Chris obviously had the S, I might as well open since, if he hit with his S, I'd have nowhere else to go.  Q says I should play I6 WADI and build a rack.  I dunno - I'd make this play again.
>Chris_Cree: QT 3L Q.T +12 290
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIMOR 4K MI.I +36 354
#note It's either this or MOIRA 4J.  I chose this for defense - now he has to bingo down the B column.  Q gives marginal preference to MOIRA, but I'm in good shape here:  75% to win.
>Chris_Cree: ADEGORS B3 DOGEARS +64 354
#note Too little,too late, for Chris.  
>Jim_Burlant: AELNOOR A1 LOAN +21 375
#note Late day fatigue creeping in.  Best would have been A1 REAL.  Regardless, I still win.
>Chris_Cree: BEIIRR A7 BE +22 376
#note C7 BEET Scores 27, but it wouldn't have mattered.
>Jim_Burlant: EOR 3A ..ORE +12 387
>Jim_Burlant:  (IIRR) +8 395
#note Games like this are why I'm very glad we don't play 8 or 9 games per day in a nationals.  This was the last game of the day and my brain just wasn't working at all - I got lucky, when I kept drawing power tiles right when I needed them.  I sure played like crap.  After 3 tournaments of being fairly sharp, I was due for a bad one.
