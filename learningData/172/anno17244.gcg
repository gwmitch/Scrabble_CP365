#note Despite giving up 6 scoreboard points to E7 HIDDEN, this unloads the V and takes away the easy OUTGIVE back hooks.  Truthfully I didn't look very hard once I saw this; the sim says the other play worth making is HIDDEN E7 30, and as a matter of fact, it prefers HIDDEN by roughly 0.3% and 0.8 points at 1000 iterations.  In retrospect, with what this did to the board, HIDDEN might not have resulted in my making as many mistakes later.
>Darrell_Day: DEGGIRS I2 DIGGERS +73 88
#note Quackle may prefer 3B DISGORGE, but for this game, this was the best choice Darrell could have made as it swung the game into his control.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADHLOR J5 OH +29 79
#note Best statically, but the sim is justifiably a diferent case.  The best play here is utterly sick and not many of us rated under 2000 would find it:  CHOROIDAL 3D scores 63 and is best.  I nver even looked at D1 for the obvious plays like DAH/RAH;  - I was probably way too paranoid about something like a potential X bomb.  This is the 4th best option, but really, if I didn't bingo here, DAH or RAH needed to be the play.  This makes the board way too easy for Darrell to defend.

>Jim_Burlant: ?ABDELR E6 AB.D.R +28 107
#note I know BARLEDUC (which plays at 1A), but that's way past any range I've ever anagrammed and won't beat myself up for missing it.  That said, there was another admittedly tough bingo to find:  LIBERATED E7.   If I'm finding ABIDER in this location, I should be finding LIBERATED in the same place.  This sucks.

>Jim_Burlant: ?EEILLU 10D ....UE +10 117
#note Quackle gives slight preference to D10 VEIL...but against Darrell, I need a little more volatility than that play offers.  I need to create a situation where anything I open up can't just be shut down in short order, and this accomplishes that.  25% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AY L3 AY +20 190
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILLNO 11I hELLION +63 180
#note I chose this instead of NIELLOs because, even though NIELLOs scores 64 to this play's 63, the one extra point I needed on the scoreboard was going to be more than cancelled out by all the easy plays he would have if I floated an S instead of an N.  Quackle agrees with me - this is best.  33% to win, but not for long.
>Darrell_Day: DEEIMNS N8 DEM.NISE +84 274
#note Small consolation - even if I'd played NIELLOS for 64, this would have been his comeback.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIQUW O4 FIQUE +72 252
#note Best, but it's still bleak - 17% to win in a short sim.
>Darrell_Day: AFJNT 15J FANJ.T +51 325
>Jim_Burlant: ABLORTW M7 BOW +28 280
#note Q wants me to chase the blank, but the only means I have of doing that is a word I didn't know, BARLOW, which plays at D1.  This scores as well as anything else I have available.  6% to winl.
>Darrell_Day: IKNO 14I KINO +21 346
>Jim_Burlant: ?AALLRT L8 LA +15 295
#note Q says I've got the right idea with the wrong execution.  It wants me to play  LALL for 2 more.  Makes sense - one more shot at an E and a slightly more balanced leave.
>Darrell_Day: AC D10 .AC +18 364
>Jim_Burlant: ?ALMRTT G7 T.L. +18 313
#note With all those E's and the S hook on row 13 it didn't occur to me to dump the rack and score.  RAMTIL 13J scores 30 and leaves T?.  This is my second best option but it only wins 14% and sims 13 points down.
>Darrell_Day: IR 3L .IR +6 370
>Jim_Burlant: ?AHMRST 13A HAMSTeR +83 396
#note Back in the game, but apparently the best play is not to bingo; Q says I should play 13A MARSH for 29.  Not sure I understand that logic.  This is 40% to win, MARSH ostensibly wins 46.
>Darrell_Day: EEIRT A10 EIT.ER +30 400
>Jim_Burlant: AENPUWZ 13M W.Z +30 426
#note If I had to grade myself honestly, I got maybe 6 of 12 plays right in this game.  While, from Darrell's perspective, it might have looked like I played well and all you saw was what I was putting down, the reality is that I missed way too many plays to have a shot at this one. One has to wonder what happens if I find LIBERATED.
