#note That's right.  I was able to find CREPITANT and knew it was valid yet I forgot that PLAINED was valid.  How can I know CREPITANT and not PLAINED?  I guess it's because PLAINED is so easy to anagram on Zyzzyva that it doesn't remain memorable, and I guess it's because I tend to remember every word that was mentioned in Word Freak because I've read it more than I wish to admit, and I later realized CREPITANT was mentioned in Word Freak.  After this, I deserved to lose.

#note I can't believe I actually thought this was good, but it was pretty convincing and gave me a (remote) shot.  If I'd played PLAINED, that would have changed everything.

#note Since the board was seemingly completely shut down for bingos with no esses or blanks left, for the rest of the game I was focusing on fishing for the last T or D for QINTAR/QINDAR, which I felt was my only shot.  I did not hit it.
