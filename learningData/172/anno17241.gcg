>Jeff: ?AEFFKR 13A KEF +30 261
#note As I played KEF I commented to Cheryl that I was glad to see her play her C because of the synergy with the K I was slotting in the triple alley. I did not know the bingo that I missed.

>Cheryl: AANOUVW M8 .NAVOW +26 500
>Jeff: AGMNOPT 14D TAMP.NG +22 507
#note I put Cheryl on hold for about 5 minutes on this play. I was fairly certain that UNAVOW was not acceptable. I wanted to see if I could win if I did not challenge. I saw 2 out plays for her ADU. DUAD=8 at 15A and dUAD=4 at O8. I figured I would win 517-516 if I did not challenge and I played TAMPING. Completely missed GAMP and TAMP at L12.
