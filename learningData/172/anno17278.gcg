#note He didn't know the word but knew not to challenge.  Pretty pathetic that I missed so many obviously superior plays that I needed this just to stay in it.  I DID do a good job of keeping him from bingoing after TRAIN but my scoring defense as usual was horrible.

#note David had three S's and a blank on the next turn and he told me that, so I had to block, but there HAD to be a better block than this.  This did not score nearly enough.

#note Wow.  I can't believe this.  Mother of board vision fails causes me to choke another one...

#note Well, if he'd seen any of his bingos FEZ vs. ZONE wouldn't have made any difference...
