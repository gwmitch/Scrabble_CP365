#note Didn't want to roll the dice and slot the triple line by playing YURTA, but C-Player says that's best.

TERRINE
>Pete_Zeigler: ABEORST I8 SORBATE +82 154
>Steve_Grob: AEIKNRT 4B KERATIN +77 190
#note I was very tempted to pass up the bingo for KINA and 59 points with an ERT leave, but this is correct. C-Player prefers the 4D placement by a tad.
>Pete_Zeigler: DEFN H12 FEND +49 203
>Steve_Grob: ?CDEFII 13G F..ICIDEs +86 276
#note Six more points than EDIFICe, albeit more dangerous. I couldn't pass up the style points. Best is a different 9 for 84, likely because it doesn't slot the 3x3 line.

#note THIS, IS A PHONEY. Hard to challenge if you're not sure at this stage.

>Steve_Grob: ADEIIOU L4 IDIO. +16 319
#note Probably don't have enough onions to play B2 AI(K)IDO, even if I did see it. Would have liked to play L3 OIDIU(M), however.

>Steve_Grob: ?EESTUV F2 VE. +14 413
#note Felt I had to block the 3x3 line to assure the win. C-Player plays VET at A11. Looking now, with help from Zyzzyva, it would have been interesting to play (L)UV at 1B. Holding the case blank and with two P's unseen, there is a chance for something like E(LUV)IATE or P(LUV)IOSE for major points.
