#note -4.7 7I GROOVE.  I think I became a bit unfocused here, I was wondering if he was fishing, if I should be blocking, and what I should be blocking.  I think I overanalyzed and did something wrong when I should have just played normally.  I wrote WAKE UP on my score sheet after I played this.

#note -3.6 L12 FEEB.  NOR > EEN as a leave.  Clearly I haven't woken up.

#note -6.5 15F NEUME.  Didn't spot it.  MENU at 12A is pretty good too.

#note -0.7 2L MIX.  With all those T's unseen it seems like suicide.

#note Nice play.
>jeremy: CDEGLMY L1 YL.M +26 231
#note -11.3 5E MYCEL(OI)D.  I actually entertained GLYCEM(OI)D*. I saw 8A GEY, but it gave up my only vowel.  I didn't want to open the board holding 4 consonants.  Provided I didn't see MYCELOID, which play do you prefer?

#note Quack has N10 DE winning on wpct, but this is the equity play.  They're very close.

>jeremy: ?DGLNUY 8A GUY +31 292
#note Another Y!  And a blank!!! I must be chanelling Bihlmeyer. I may have a chance now.  That Y is the key.  I can score and open the board for a shot at an -ING bingo.  My odds to win are over 50% for the first time this game.
