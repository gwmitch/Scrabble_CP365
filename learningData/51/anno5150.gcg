>Harshan_L.: MNX H7 M.NX +13 13
>Jason: AEGORTV 10F VO. +21 43
#note Love the board configuration, esp. with a 30-point lead. But, this being Collins, the game still ends up a shootout.
>Harshan_L.: III -III +0 13
>Jason: AEEGIRT F10 .EG +7 50
#note Not really sure what's right here. Hard to put complete faith in Quackle here given that I wanted to keep the board fairly closed and he just passed three. Didn't know VEGO# until Quackling this game, though, so maybe this isn't the closer I want. Exchange??? Doesn't seem right. FWIW, (N)EG is the sim leader. (-2)
>Harshan_L.: ES H7 ....ES +16 29
>Jason: AEIRTTT I1 TITRATE +64 114
>Harshan_L.: EELNSST 1F TEN.LESS +77 106
#note I probable should've given him the nickel (five points) here to check, but I figured since he had gobs of other bingos, he was baiting me. I regretted not challenging when he admitted he wasn't sure after the game, but it is good (and ours).
>Jason: CEEINRT 5D CENTI.RE +90 204
#note Nice post-bingo draw, lead by almost 100, we've burned through most of the good bingo tiles, I've played near-perfect. I know Harshan's a fantastic player, but I'm feeling good about life right now.
>Harshan_L.: DDOWY 4K DOWDY +37 143
>Jason: GHIIOPR 3L HOI +30 234
#note Whoa, PRIG(G)I(S)H! This is neck-and-neck with it, though.
>Harshan_L.: ??AINOU 2A cAUtION +70 213
>Jason: EEGIPRR N2 R..GE +18 252
#note My losing play. Considered GRIPE/(ME)G, but went with this. Asked for Thevenot's advice on this position and had a really good conversation. Feel somewhat vindicated that it leads sim by three points, but would welcome comments on it.
>Harshan_L.: ADEIMOW O6 MIAOWED +99 312
#note Owie. Not only did I give him a spot to play this for 99, but GRIPE or GRIPER making MEG turns this into an orphan. That was my day one at Worlds. Zagged when I shoulda zigged, zigged when I shoulda zagged. 
>Jason: AEIPRSU J7 UPRAISE +66 318
#note SPURIAE#/(VEG)A#. I knew neither. (-4)
>Harshan_L.: ACLOV 13C VOCAL +30 342

>Harshan_L.: AFN 15A FAN. +33 375

#note RI(C)H, E11. Although it wouldn't have mattered, as you'll see. (-14)

>Jason: IJLPRUU 8L JUR. +19 403
#note JUP(E), 11L. I knew I was probably making a mess of things, but really didn't care. (-18)
>Harshan_L.: AABDFOY 14J DOF +26 483
>Jason: ILPU 3A .IP +20 423
#note Saw he had YABA# ("Yet Another Bloody Acronym" ... you can't make this stuff up) for 26 (N11) and 21 (15K), so just decided to maximize score minus leave. Oops. Also hurt that I didn't know P(HEEZE)#. (-12)
>Harshan_L.: AABY 15L YABA +51 534
#note Made an audible groan as he put it down. Dumbass. Frustrating to lose six equity points total the first nine turns and lose by 115. Just your typical 900 Collins game (actually 536-421; they do the add/subtract with tiles left on opp's rack).
>Harshan_L.:  (LU) +4 538
