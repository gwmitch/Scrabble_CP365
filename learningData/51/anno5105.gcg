#note interesting.  4K (A)H keeping ILNOPT is the top play before the sim.  The sim likes H1 THIL(L).  My play is a phony.  I knew HOLP meant HELP, but it's an expression, and it doesn't take an S.

#note Libero held the play.  He said he would have challenged but it gave him this high scoring play.

#note This was the game losing move.  I am destroying too much bingo real estate by doing this.  I was hesitant about doing it, but there are a lot more turns to open the board later.  I'm sure I'll bingo eventually. I'm obviously to used to playing against Quackle, not humans.  For the record, Quack likes 2K (G)O(O)F by about 7.
>libero: NO 2K .O.N +19 249
#note an intentional block.  Still have that R at K3 though.
>jeremy: ?AEEHVY F2 HEA.Y +30 219
#note If that T was open, I'd be playing HEAVYsE(T) right about now.  The sim winner is O1 (G)YVE which I think is much worse.
>libero: EIIMS H1 SIMI.E +27 276
#note Another bingo block.
>jeremy: ?AAEGRV 3A RAVAG. +20 239
#note It's the old V in the middle trick.  Impossible to block all the bingo lanes now!  I admit this move is a tad bit aggressive, but it could also work and get me back in the game.  Quack likes 3C GAV(E)
>libero: DIL A1 DI.L +18 294
>jeremy: ?DDEMSZ D2 M.ZED +34 273
#note The duck likes D(A)ZED in the same spot instead.
>libero: EORTTX C6 EXTORT +25 319
#note That makes it tough to bingo.

#note Duck says F10 (C)UB has a 18.04% shot to win.  Quack's skill at finding nines is better than mine though.  I ran out of time trying to come up with a way to win.  My play creates a line at L9 which nothing will work with, but if I draw ACR I could win if I know sUC(TO)RIAN given Libero doesn't block that.
