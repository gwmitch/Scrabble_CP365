#note dead even on a sim between tacking on the A and not.
>Mike: ADIQ C7 QADI +41 41
>JD: ADEITWW B10 TAWED +26 70
#note TAWIE makes it a little more difficult to kill me on column A, but for 2 points less
>Mike: HIP A13 HIP +32 73
>JD: AIJOUUW F6 JU. +26 96
#note with a godawful rack why not take the chance to shut the board down?

>JD: AEEIRRU 6F .EU +10 134
#note the only quackle suggestion I would consider playing is UREIC, I guess, but I am perfectly happy with my play - force mike to play on a very defensive setup, and I figured there was some bingo percentage down from the C with my rack
>Mike: EEHMOST -EEHM +0 119
>JD: ADEIPRR E10 PI +12 146
#note juniper looks great. didn't see it. my play is non-awful.
>Mike: KORY H8 .ORKY +18 137
>JD: ADERRTV 12F DR. +7 153
#note on such tight boards it's best to be greedy with points - again, missed a chance to extend JUN to JUNTA.
>Mike: AEENRST 5H NEAREST +66 203
>JD: AENORTV L4 R.NOVATE +80 233
#note the advantage of keeping a decent rack is being able to retaliate when things finally open up, but junta last turn was still too many points
>Mike: ABGITTY M9 BATTY +37 240
#note mike's actual rack
>JD: AEEFHNT K9 FEH +41 274
#note I thought I was in good shape at this point
>Mike: ?GILSSZ N2 GLI.Z +70 310
#note epic draw for mike! this is his actual rack at this point 
>JD: AEGNOOT O6 AGONE +29 303
#note the board is still so tight that playing here takes out one of the easiest ways for him to score (his points per turn drops from 36 to 30!). also, I really need a blank to compete, and this flips over an extra tile.
>Mike: ??ARS 12L S.AR +34 344
>JD: AEEILOT 13F OE +9 312
#note as it turns out I'm doomed, but what else am I supposed to do here? maybe ROLE at O12 to again go for a blank and create a lane? Mike did a nice job of reverse-telling me - I thought I saw a bit of a frown when I put my play down.

#note out. of. time. LLAMA actually blocks his outs.
