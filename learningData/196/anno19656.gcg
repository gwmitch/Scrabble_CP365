>Daniel_O'Dowd: AIILSTT F7 TAIL +11 11
#note 4/6/14: I notice TRIALIST straight away. That at least is encouraging - more bingo study has honed my ability to say "hey isn't there a bingo here". So the only question is to striate the other candidates. I think removing L was right on two counts: it makes it slightly harder for her to bodge up the board, but also it gives me an extra +e draw. That's slightly more important at the opening. The positioning is a little off perhaps: L is not quite as intuitively useful-feeling for eights as a second T might be. TAI/AGAR is probably a little keepy for my endeavours. Quackle shows GART/LITAI for 14 as also being very useful to play. 
>Trish_Matthews: EO G7 E.O +12 20
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEEISTU E5 EAU +9 20
#note Not sure what motivates such a play as EGO, possibly just a vowel heavy nongo. In that case I should strive to make a second opening. If I was being slightly defensive I could make a case now for playing AU(R)EI but then the odds of her having an -S for TAILS are quite high so that perhaps is oversimple. In the same vein I think URAEI would be a blunder: just one good tile gives her a high score down H. I'd say EAU is justified for sure, EIST with a floating R and E is a good situation to be in and the floaters are at right angles along with two -S hooks available. Quackle agrees with the move.
>Trish_Matthews: DEFUZ D2 FUZED +41 61
#note It turns out she was being defensive quite possibly, but now powers ahead with the first heavy score of the game.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EEIILST 2B LI.E +14 34
#note So the bag is a little vowel heavy, specifically, with I, so I should be careful if I'm playing a lot of tiles off. I see no bingo, there's no easy place to score a lot, and I'm running a deficit already. All of this explains my gambly move LI(F)E, but I can't be sure there isn't better by a long stretch. That said, it's hard to find anything else - LEZ would be a move of a man who had to just keep it tight to win the tournament by spread in g7. In fact Quackle tells me there's TILERIES, and approves of LIFE among a few others. (F)IE is even better but my move is point-greedier which takes precedence at this stage of my tournament career. LE(F)TIE keeps IS which is undesirable with the bag as it is. One reason I did so well in this tournament was that I was able to stay entirely calm in such situations - I had no tanks or melts like online, because of bad situations like, this, which pass.
>Trish_Matthews: EPRX 1E PREX +43 104
#note And bang, I get hit badly, but not my problem.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ?AEHIST 11F STHEnIA +73 107
#note Since I immediately picked up a bingo to get right back into things. Curiously I seem to have rejected HASTIER/AGARS, presumably on an insecurity of plural, which scores a few more. Top score is the double double ASHIEST, ASTHENIA from the centre makes 86, and Quack prefers SHEITAN slightly to STHENIA. Presumably this is partly due to the A at the end being vulnerable, but I don't see that as a worry. It might also be because H 5s are quite easy so I am giving points away there that are more important than E being there what with X already out of the bag.
>Trish_Matthews: NNNY L10 N.NNY +16 120
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ELOORTY H11 .OLEY +36 143
#note But part of the putting H there was that I had surely as good a chance as her to use it - and here was one such example. I wonder is HOOEY better - the bag isn't so heavy so maybe that's a gamble too far. Quackle finds only HOOLY and HOOTY better (E is that much better than O apparently). HOYLE is also new, and HELOT.
>Trish_Matthews: GV C1 V.G +20 140
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ABNORTU 2G RUB +16 159
#note I can't play TABOURIN unfortunately. I'm looking at BEE/BOUN/ODA perhaps as slightly superior to ER/RUB, though I can see I was looking for OUT- bingos or something, it's a little inflexible. Or there's BEGO/BOUN too. BU(Y) in 14 might also be worth it. The new hook ASTHENIA yields ABOUT, or there's BA(Y)OU if you look hard enough for 32. ARNUT is a new five. 
>Trish_Matthews: RW 14J WR. +17 157
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AENOOTT C5 TOO +11 170
#note TOO is at least giving me an idealist leave. I think something like BO/OATEN is also ok though probably. OONT/OW/OR is a new four that does best with the goods. Quack prefers a higher scoring move such as ASTHENIA/EAT though to many others. TE/TOO(N) for 13 is also rated highly in 10. 
>Trish_Matthews: ADIT 8A DITA +22 179
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AAEEMNT 3I EMANATE +75 245
#note A nice second bingo now put me in the lead despite not being at my best so far. ENEMATA also plays, and MANATEE.
>Trish_Matthews: DIQSU O3 .QUIDS +78 257
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EIJORRW 8L JOW. +22 267
#note Unfortunately it wasn't my game - she immediately snagged a huge Q score, so I was behind again. There aren't that many vowels in the bag now. EIRR felt good enough to be pushing another bingo so JOWS it was. I could have perhaps been more willing to score higher, though this does do well. Quack wants to play ROJI two columns higher for 5 more, keeping W, though my move is fine.
>Trish_Matthews: FHO N6 HO.F +37 294
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEEINRR M7 R.E +16 283
#note One point of ROJI is it might have helped me to stop a play such as HOWF. AEINR would be perfect for bingo hunting. Hence my motivation to play ROE when I could score better. WRYER would achieve this perfectly, or EL/EAR/ASTHENIA. Still, I'm giving myself plenty of chances and playing the way I think I should.
>Trish_Matthews: CNO B6 CO.N +27 321
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ABEINRV 1A VA. +29 312
#note I was unlucky to pick these letters, and decided score was important now. AIVER/ASTHENIA is too far - BEAN/BIO is maybe acceptable. BEGO/BRAVI for 25 is a better move, as is AN/NAB.
>Trish_Matthews: MO G14 MO +13 334
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BDEEINR 4I DINER +30 342
#note Nowhere to play the bingo, didn't feel DEBRINED* was a risk worth taking. So I scored as heavily as I could. Lots of moves aer better though. NIDE leaving BER, BIDE leaving ENR, etc. I mean the move has huge static valuation, but the negative leave equity makes it that much less attractive. Still, for my first tournament, I can't overly worry about such things - I remember I was also battling the clock, and I'm still very much struggling with leave v score considerations in the middlegame, let alone pre-endgame.
>Trish_Matthews: ?AGIIST A8 .IGITAlS +82 416
#note Unfortunately she gets a bingo to render things moot. Oh well, she did everything she needed to in this game :) 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BCEKLPS K1 PL..KS +24 366
#note So now I had to find the best endgame move, and at the time I was thusly focused purely on point greed and tile removal since I knew she could be out next turn. I apparently didn't do well here - better is KEBS/BEDE/MID/ANS for 40 leaving CLP, or other such parallels. But I guess I had no time and I lacked endgame composure often at the time.
