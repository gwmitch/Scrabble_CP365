#note Quackle really wanted me to exchange here. Best valuation was exchanging QWX, then QTWX, then QX. I love the X and probably should have seriously considered exchanging. I took a while for this play. 
>Jason: GP H7 P.G +6 20
>Jennifer: ELRSWXZ J8 SEX +34 46
#note And my failure to exchange last turn catches up to me with some tough consonant synergy. Quackle's preferred play was SEX at 10H for one point less.
>Jason: OO 10I O.O +10 30
>Jennifer: ELLMRWZ 11K MEW +24 70
#note I wanted to play MEWL here, as did Quackle, but like an idiot I couldn't remember if it was good. I get MEWL and MAWN mixed up a lot and can never remember with confidence which one takes the L and which one takes the N.
>Jason: ?ACEEOT 11C COATEEs +67 97
#note Quackle greatly prefers ACETOsE at 10A.

>Jennifer: ?ADDGRV D6 DRAG +29 241
#note I played DRAG to create the phony *NUG, which Jason did not challenge. 
>Jason: AEHINOT K9 T.. +7 246
>Jennifer: ?ADNORV L6 NOVA +14 255
#note I disagree with Quackle here. Jason's one-tile fish told me that he was close to bingoing. I couldn't simultaneously kill the bingo line above BIRR and take out the ET hook line he had just created, but I thought the ET line was more dangerous so I played NOVA there. It's still possibly to bingo with a parallel play next to down to NO in NOVA, but I hoped it would make things harder for him.
>Jason: F 7L .F +5 251
>Jennifer: ?ADINOR 8L .AIN +26 281
#note Huge miss here by not seeing any of the many playable bingos: DIATRON, ANDIRON, ORDINAI, ADORING, ANEROID, ORDAINS.
>Jason: AAEINST 3E ENTASIA +59 310
>Jennifer: ?DEEFOR O2 FOREtE.D +62 343
>Jennifer: ?DEEFOR --  -62 281
#note Second critical mistake. I didn't realize how close the game was and that I could conceivably win without bingoing. Jason's bingo on the prior turn freaked me out into thinking that I had to bingo to win. So I ran down the seven or so remaining minutes on my clock looking desperately for a bingo. I missed the valid bingos OFFENDER, FOREFEND, and FOREDONE. Instead, I played the desperate phony outplay bingo *FOREtE(N)D and hit my clock with 0:00 remaining. Jason challenged it off, of course.
>Jason: AHIOT O5 THI. +7 317
>Jennifer: ?DEEFOR H1 DR.Ft +36 317
#note At least I got this play right. My clock was running into minus time here, as I had not left any time for me after the last play because I hoped it was my outplay. When I realized how much this scored, I realized that I could have won without bingoing and should NOT have tried a phony bingo as my outplay. Still not enough to overtake Jason, and the minus 10 for running over on time sealed the victory for him.
