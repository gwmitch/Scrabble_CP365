>Jennifer: AEEGNNO H4 AGONE +14 14
>Brian: GOX I4 GOX +26 26
>Jennifer: AAEILNT G4 TALE +26 40
#note Ugh. Huge miss here. ALIENATE is one of the few 8's that I actually do find in Zyzzva. Didn't see it here.
>Brian: EGIJR I8 REJIG +16 42
>Jennifer: ACINPRS 12B SCRAPIN. +78 118
>Brian: AEP H12 .APE +18 60
>Jennifer: CDFHRSW E10 WH.RF +28 146
#note Quackle prefers DWARF in the same spot here. I like that better and would have played it if I had seen it, as CHS is a much better leave than CDS.
>Brian: BDETU B10 BU.TED +30 90
>Jennifer: ?ACDDES 3A CADDiES +75 221
#note Um, Quackle prefers I dump DE at A14 and hold ACDS?. I take my bingos when I see them.
>Brian: AOZ 2B ZOA +52 142
>Jennifer: BDELOTY 1D BOLTED +45 266
#note Quackle pferes BOTEL to hold the DY leave. I briefly considered #BOYED but didn't think it was good. It isn't (in TWL).
>Brian: OW A14 WO +29 171
>Jennifer: AEIOSTY A3 .OYEST +36 302
>Brian: ?EIITUV 14H .UtITIVE +74 245
#note OMG. I did not realize until just now that *PUtITIVE is phony. It's a word in legal land! I feel like I always run into trouble with legal and neuro words, the ones I should know best.  The correct bingo would have been PUnITIVE.
>Jennifer: AEEINRR O10 EERI.R +21 323
>Brian: IMV N8 VIM +24 269
>Jennifer: AILLNNS 15K NAN +11 334
#note I was super paranoid about Brian bingoing and thought these lanes were more important to block than the underplay at 2H or 2I. In hindsight, this seems like a poor play.
>Brian: EHI 8L HI.E +42 311
>Jennifer: AILLOSU J9 LO +17 351
#note Still suffering from bingo paranoia here and afraid that Brian is setting up the S hook on HIVE to make SHIVE. I wasn't 100% sure the hook was good, which is why I did not take advantage of it myself. Instead, I do this lame play that Quackle hates.
>Brian: OQU M11 QUO.. +28 339
>Jennifer: AFILSTU M6 FA.L +9 360
#note FA(I)L: verb, to make a subpar play that leaves a horrible leave going into the endgame. 

(I did not know FISTULA(E) at O1.)
>Brian: AKRT G9 TRA.K +16 355
>Jennifer: IISUY 11K SU. +24 384
#note At this point, I know my leave was going to be bad, and was just hoping to score enough points that I could outrun Brian's end plays.
>Brian: MNN L10 M.N +14 369
>Jennifer: IIY F1 .Y. +14 398
>Brian: N 14A ..N +6 375
#note Okay, I'm not sure quite what happened with our math here, but the score we reported was me winning 404-387.
>Brian:  (II) +4 379
