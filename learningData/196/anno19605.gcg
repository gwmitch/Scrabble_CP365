#note LoL.  GOXES is an improvement.  It's obvious now, but I was spending too much time looking for imaginary bingos

#note D4 MOFETTE is very nice.  Simple play like N2 FIT is ok.  I was too focused on blocking line 11, but I need to be doing more / scoring more

#note Laid COLONIST first, but figured this was pretty safe, while also blocking the open P.  Should've just taken COLONIST. The pool is heavy on highpointers; this gives him avenues to dump them for pts
