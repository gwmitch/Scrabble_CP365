>Matt_Canik: ABDEGJO 7H BOG +21 21
#note Wow! BEG is actually winning. I saw it, liked that it held both AG and OBE, and then was like "no that's way too cute". It's only like .4 above BOG
>Patricia_Barrett: AILP 6I PAIL +25 51
>Matt_Canik: ADEIJRR L3 JAI.ER +28 49
#note There's really no reason to hold DEIR on this board. I'm not bingoing unless pat opens stuff.

>Matt_Canik: ABCEFOZ H11 FEZ +28 237
#note FAZE is really scary to me. Pat responds with a 14B play and sets up an S hook that I don't have. That's no fun. Did I overthink this?
>Patricia_Barrett: ILOO O6 OLIO +15 205
>Matt_Canik: AABCNNO 13C CON. +19 256
#note I think I'm trying to block SWITHE here. ABACI is way better

>Matt_Canik: AABEMNR O11 AMEBA +42 298
#note BRA(K)EMAN but that might be wrong anyway, she can counterbingo for like 90 a bunch from a pool of SATINESATINE??
>Patricia_Barrett: ?AINNOS 15H SONAtIN. +71 294
>Matt_Canik: EGLNQRT 5K Q. +44 342
>Patricia_Barrett: ?AINOSS G3 NO.A +8 302
#note Pat used a ton of time on this turn and finally threw this down with 0:14 left. Q says S(C)AN wins88% but I think there may be some faulty logic there.... regardless I don't think she should be playing to bingo now. If she pulls the E I think she wins most of the time.
