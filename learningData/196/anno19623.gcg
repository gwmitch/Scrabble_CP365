#note ah, yes. this game. I was looking forward to you.
>JD: DDKNORR F6 DR.NK +24 24
#note it had been a long day. this play felt appropriate.
>Doug: AO G8 .OA +22 56
>JD: DELNNOR D2 ENDLON. +18 42
#note seemed to give fewer points back than OLDEN
>Doug: MUY H10 YUM +21 77

>Doug: EGIINT 3B IG.ITE +16 93
#note neither of us felt like scoring points apparently
>JD: BEILNRT H1 BIRL +29 95
#note or berlin to continue me and doug's obsession with turnover this game
>Doug: ITT 5B TI.T +8 101
>JD: AAAEENT A5 ANTAE +20 115
#note this play felt wretched at the time, but it sims best! averaging a nice 22 points per turn each
>Doug: ?HMOORT 12A MoTORHO.. +86 187
>Doug: ?HMOORT --  -86 101
#note this was a spectacular find, but he had BATHROOM at the top that both of us missed!
>JD: AAEFIST J5 TAFIAS +29 144
#note lucky it wasn't CSW, because MOTORHOME# is good in that dictionary! in retrospect I dislike my move - I'm not going to outrun him from this spot, I should probably take advantage of the extra turn to try to groom my rack for a bingo. the board is too open for me to block. in retrospect, definitely a mistake.
>Doug: ?HMOORT K3 MHO +20 121
>JD: EEELNSS L2 SEEN +25 169
#note continuing my nice trend of scoring in the mid-20s
>Doug: ?DORT M1 ROD +22 143
>JD: EEIILSU 11B ILEUS +21 190
#note I figured there was a lot of value in blocking column B, but again, I'm probably not up by enough to keep blowing up my rack and hoping to outrun him. after all, LONERS is still available. just TUI at B5 wins a sim. if I do play here I should probably play LIEUS.
>Doug: ?ACIRT 8J .ATRIC +27 170
>JD: ?EEEFGI 1M .EF +18 208
#note quackle suggests being a little more proactively defensive by playing either IF at 12C or FLEE, taking away some cheap scoring plays.
>Doug: ?ABHORU M6 HA.BOURs +82 252
>JD: ?AEEGIJ 11K JE. +20 228
#note I was a bit complacent here, thinking that I would get my bingo down and be able to win from there...but the pool is loathsome, so that's hardly a certainty. playing JIG on this turn is a huge deal! I take away cheap points with the Q (although he still has B2), and AEEI? will fill in very well with the pool. on the other hand, I didn't know if doug had thought of PILEUS yet. still should probably play JIG.
>Doug: DEOPPQY B10 Q. +31 283
#note ugh!
>JD: ?ADEGII K11 .IG +11 239
#note I was out of time and ideas by this point, and missed ALGICIDE! but even ALGICIDE is probably not enough to win often due to the horrendous remaining tile pool. still, my changes of bingoing next turn are so low that I should probably go for it.
>Doug: WY 10L Y.W +22 305
#note nice block by doug. I guess he had the S. I was thinking about fishing for PICOWAVE before he blocked.
>JD: ?ADEIPW J13 AW +17 256
#note My play wins if I draw the E, which is 8/36 with a random rack.
>Doug: CEOOPSV 15G COVE +33 338
>JD: ?DEIPVX N1 .X +38 294
#note ran out of time, should play POXED/PILEUS to clear 300
>Doug: OPS O10 SOP +18 356
