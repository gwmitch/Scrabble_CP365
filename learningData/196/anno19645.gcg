>Matt_Canik: ILNOPRY 9E PIN.Y +22 50
#note I agonized over this turn for a good 5 minutes. I decided to play PINNY over PORNY here because Mike is going to need an -IF/-EF word to score well along the 10 row...
>Mike_Early: CFIU 10C CUIF +34 50
#note hahahaha of course

>Mike_Early: DEE H12 .EED +15 205
>Matt_Canik: BDHIRST 15A DRIBS +44 230
#note Answer: PIGGIER/PIGGES are both good. 
--
Would anyone play BIRDS here instead of DRIBS to create a lower-volatility board because he can't bingo to the B?

I didn't know BIRDSH(O)T, but that's clearly right

#note So glad this wasn't at N5.

#note Fishing on closed boards is wrong, but I don't think this is a fish as much as it is an S setup. I should probably have thought longer and played TULE, because that way if I draw a high-scoring tile I can hit it on O4 and get way more points.

#note Wow that's lucky
>Mike_Early: FGHU 1H F.UGH +48 334
>Matt_Canik: ?AKLNPR A12 PAR. +20 368
#note Want to hold the K for K(AE)s. Scoring 20 then 36, I pretty much can't lose this game unless he has a bingo that fits on this board, even if he has Q(U)I(Z)
