>Noah: ADEFFOO 8H OFFED +28 28
>Conrad: AEIRRST K5 ART.RIES +82 82
>Noah: AACEOOT J6 OA. +14 42
#note Missed AERO, which is also good, though this is reasonable because AERO lets him score better on row 10.
>Conrad: ?AEGSVY 9B GArVEYS +70 152
>Noah: ACEIOTW L3 WAITE. +28 70
#note Thought about COW(r)ITE and COWIE(S)T, but those plays put me on a fast track to a closed board. This doesn't.
>Conrad: Q 10J Q. +31 183
>Noah: AACEEOO D7 OC.EAE +20 90
#note I don't love taking up more space and keeping AO, but there's not much choice here.
>Conrad: EHMP L12 HEMP +38 221
>Noah: ADLOOOU 15L .OOD +21 111
#note Also thought about ALOUD, but it just felt like this accomplished everything better, except for leave, which it seemed was similar between the two plays. Too lazy to explain the thought process in more detail right now. I do like this because it feels like it keeps the board a bit more how I want it -- better control of space, scoring spots a little easier to handle.
>Conrad: ACILNT C2 TINCAL +21 242
#note I thought Conrad probably had an N here, because TICAL M9 was available.
>Noah: AELOPRU M9 PULER +30 141
#note This rack baffled me. I wanted to play off OPU, but the plays that did that seemed really horrible for me -- COUP blocks lanes, UPO B2 blocks lanes and opens scoring spots, UPO E4 blocks lanes and scores poorly, UPO M2 might be good. All the long plays (COPULA, CUPOLA, COPULAE, COPULAR, OUTLEAP) either block lanes or open good scoring spots or both. That left PULER and PEARL, and I liked keeping AO and a bit more comeback-friendly board shape. Finally, to compare between UPO M1 and PULER, I think I like M1 UPO -- the scoring it gives up doesn't look good enough to justify not playing it, especially with so many good places for Conrad to score here already, and UPO still leaves a great board. Quackle says he does score about 6 more on average after UPO, but that yeah, UPO is otherwise just so good here. Seems like a significant mistake.
>Conrad: GUV E5 VUG +18 260
>Noah: AABJLOW M2 JOWL +46 187
#note Thought about JOW but I didn't think AABL was a significant improvement and wanted points here. 
>Conrad: ?ADORTY 11B bO.TYARD +72 332
>Noah: AABINUZ 8A ZA +36 223
#note Can't really make it back in here, I don't think, and even so this seemed like my best way back in. Stuff like JUN, BUNA, NIZAM is too desparate and falls prey to outscoring a lot, and just not hitting many draws, I think.
>Conrad: NN C9 .N.N +8 340
>Noah: ABINRSU 14E URBANIS. +66 289
>Conrad: EGIKLNR 3B K.NGLIER +65 405
>Noah: DEIISTT 15G ID +22 311
#note Wasn't actually thinking about winning here, which I can maybe still do, but I don't see it right now. Certainly spread isn't important here, hehe, so maybe I just try something crazy.
>Conrad: HI N10 HI +28 433
>Noah: BEEISTT 4A BI.E +28 339
#note Conrad knew I had this rack because I excitedly showed it to Betty.
