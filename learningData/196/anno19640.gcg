>Lenny_Moir: DO 8G DO +6 6
#note And so it was that my first game was underway. Let's focus on the good things I did in this game.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EIMNORZ 7H MOZ +19 19
#note So apparently I declared this move as 21 originally. That makes patently no sense, and is a clear sign of the total unfluency in my first game. What also strikes me is how I didn't play MOZ/OD/ZO for 11 pts more. I can't hold that against myself in my first ever game though. EINR was an ideal leave so I didn't have to contemplate too much on this move. Perhaps there's also merit in ZO/ZO, though that doesn't seem to leave much of an opening for a bingo anyways. So the other move to contemplate would be (D)ZO, which leaves a hotspot. Using non-clock thought (this is where I do as in poker, and try to think perfectly to future-apply to games), he had an O, so that would tend to rule out his having possessed a J/K/H/Y sort of tile, especially if burning D, which lends credence to the idea he is sitting on something like EINRT or that sort of strong set. He could have an F or something like that, which isn't so much of a worry with a front O. (D)ZO doesn't seem like a move that lends easily to his reply closing the board, especially with what seems like a fish. But I still haven't done much bingo study - most of what I've done is the bread and butter, so perhaps I should make EIMNR my first 5-stem to study a group of words in, since it means I get a huge batch of 108 bingos all in one and more than that many eights. So I lose points for the positioning being off, but MOZ is fine as a play - it's aggressive! 10 Days Later: Actually I may well have been deep looking at MOZ positioning in game, that strikes a chord of logic. MOZ/OD/ZO looks a bit more closed because only DO- is a realistic hook then, and my tiles are so good that I don't want to risk my play being surrounded. In that case we see a trait from the very first move of positional aggression over the conventional scoring tenets, it will be interesting to see if this continues.
>Lenny_Moir: ANY J7 .ANY +24 30
#note Now we see he had Y - his (Z)ANY play closes the top right of the board for now. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AADEINR 9B ARANEID +70 89
#note I get to play a bingo on my second ever turn. Sweet indeed! Good job I studied everything before the tournament, as you will see later. I imagine (though I can not be sure) that I chose not to play the bingo from F8 since his play so far makes an S a real threat. I accepted quite readily that my move opened the triple up for a high score - I can't play scared, I was in Division B for heaven's sake, I was not expecting more than 2-3 wins.
>Lenny_Moir: ETW 10B WET +31 61
#note And he wisely takes a chance to score well. I guess he's an aggressive player too though, I imagine he was still keeping the ideal leave for a return bingo early on.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EEEIIOP 8A OPE +26 115
#note My pickup was poor so I would have contemplated changing, but the triple is gleaming, and I have the early initiative. As of yet I wasn't sure of MOZE but it was an option for later - OPE is the only strategically compensatory move asides changing that I saw. We have to say his average score on a board like this should be 20 something, but it just takes one clunky letter for that triple to be a real threat, and the board is quite closed at the moment, so it seemed justified. And besides that, this is dirty scrabble - aggressive, practical-based. So I leave EEII - how is he to know that? 10 days later: I can still only see OPE, so it's time to ask Quackle. It wants to play in the same place, EPEE. I must have forgotten to consider that move or have been trying to play quickly (relatively slowly in fact, therefore trying to conserve time). So I lost 10 points here. PIOYE plays but I couldn't be sure of that. The move is fine, so a big tick for me so far.
>Lenny_Moir: TUU K10 UTU +11 72
#note Clearly being afflicted by poor luck, but this vindicates my previous move in a way because UTU from the triple would of course score a lot more. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EEEIIOR K3 EERIE +25 140
#note It was good fortune to get the EERIE dump available, with my MOZE hook an easy risk in the situation, while counter-opening the top of the board in case he bingos in 13. Keeping ER (with only one I out, don't risk duplicates!) is the only other comparable move, but EERIE is on top by a huge amount.
>Lenny_Moir: ?AALRST 13E LARiATS +62 134
#note And at last his persistence pays off. AsTRALS would be slightly stronger by not opening the triple, I'm sure there is something better perhaps in column L. In fact Quackle doesn't want to play in L (or can't). It suggests E4 ASTERNAL as a doubledouble through the N. I was right about ASTRALS and it can be played with PAWA/ERES/ATT. Lots of words here.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BIIJNOW 7C WINO +22 162
#note So I have some powerful tiles on the rack to counter his comeback. JOW/AW doesn't solve my I problem, and equally makes a snapback score easy. It would be a choice if I had no other scoring moves, but I do. WINO deliberately opens another hotspot, hoping to use it for my J. BIJ is far from a good leave, but it's nice to see I wasn't playing at all scared. I imagine I was also led by his willingness to create a hotspot - so that I have at least a chance to come back if he lands an X there. 10 Days Later: WINO is a 22 point play that opens a K/Y/H vulnerable hotspot. If he takes that X spot he set up suddenly; I've lost 35 points equity there and then, and then when I play J off I regain some. In the cases where he has no hot letter, he sees that WINO is an odd move and blocks that spot, and I may end up losing 15 points equity from the -J play. He won't be losing that much by blocking. JOW/AW is a 36 point play that opens the triple lane. It takes out the previous TWS hotspot and if he has a four that ends in A/O and has a strong tile in from 15A, for a 30ish point score; more power to him. That isn't the worry: the worry is that he will sit on a hot tile and be able to cancel out my J play with say, LOP/PERV or something of that level. I think realistically the threat beneath is lesser, and not playing J off was clearly a very aggressive chances-maximisation move that echoes my earlier positioning oddity with MOZ. It is the second score sacrifice I have made in this game (which is as tight as it can be), which puts my total equity at about -25. In a game online while post-fluent I'd probably be confident enough to play JOW/AW, but this begs a further question: surely the consensus candidate is to play JIB/LI/AB, which is not only harder to hook down to the triple lane from, but keeps INOW which is perfectly serviceable. Though if I'm going to play normally I should play JOW because BIIN has as much potential and it's 6 points. I'm sure I thought of that but decided to be aggressive in the game, but the actual level of aggression here really surprises me. This will be a major talking point of the first game. After thought, Quackle ranks JOW/OE/WE as the top move - I didn't even look there - scoring 36 and blocking the top of the board, but then it posits WINO! This is very interesting. BOWIE (as in knife) is a new word. I didn't consider J2 because I want to keep the board open in case the game is tense, but I think perhaps this is a hint that I can't afford to be so dogmatic and that I could do better by saying on a micro level "my rack leave is poor, therefore, a move that closes the board is good", which is what I do online in fact a lot in my games which look quite odd where one move I close then I open. Clearly I have some strategical mishmashery to resolve with "Aggression" in terms of plays, and "Greed" in terms of scoring, and when the two collide so neatly.
>Lenny_Moir: EFL H12 F.LE +30 164
#note More opening, and quite naturally taking out a dangerous spot. WINO creating the hotspot is easily disguised since it seems the only good place to be playing off the W with mediocre tiles. I also had possibilities of snagging a JI* four in H12 myself.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BIJOPRX 14D POX +55 217
#note An embarrassment of riches here! Again, POX doesn't give away that I have J as a threat, though PIX strikes me as better for obvious reasons. Strange error! 10 Days Later I find it highly ironic that having worried about X, I now land it! At first sight POX looks a little off; Quackle agrees but the main point is that in-game I thought "oh I'm more likely to get {A/O} from draw than I, so POX is okay" not realising I needed that O for JO/JO or the setup is meaningless!!
>Lenny_Moir: OO 15D OO +11 175
#note Either he is a weakfisher, or he is struggling to make meaningful scores, or fears I will bonk into the triple and is waiting to get a bingo to come back at me with. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ABIJLRT 6F JA +50 267
#note And this is an easy play to make for yet another big score. I can't tell you whether I thought long enough to observe that TAJ scores 5 more, but I may well have subconsciously kept T simply because it's T. I am therefore curious to understand what factors in evaluation prompt engines to prefer these dumpy moves - I thought the average score per tile should be 10, so why does JA for 50 rank below TAJ for 55? I note JELAB and BAJRI as new words.
>Lenny_Moir: EI 11K .IE +3 178
#note He's definitely sacrificing too many points turn by turn, it's got to the point where I can start to rackrifice.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BHHILRT N10 BRITH +36 303
#note This was a risky move, I applaud myself for playing it in terms of score seeking, knowing that even if he bingos I then lead and have plenty of chances since he would need then a third bingo. His passive play of the last few moves (F(i)LE, OO, (T)IE) has enabled this and made my life much easier. 10 Days Later, this is another clearly risking aggressive move, such things are borne of playing Elise and having good experiences on ISC. It isn't as much risking as simply scoring so much each turn that strategy as a concept doesn't need to be applied. To be fair the move also works as a rack dump - remember you have only one vowel! Quackle finds nothing else near this. BHEL, THIBLE, LITH, HETH, are noted though.
>Lenny_Moir: CIST 15L CIST +38 216
#note I challenged CIST, but hey look - I made him burn an S. I mean sure he might have another, but he might be rackrificing small too which harms his long term chances since I can now close the triple lane. 10 Days Later: There, look - another example of morphous strategic thinking, that's the sort of thing you struggled with in chess because you were always looking in the microlevel, and not modifying the plan enough. More importantly you recognised that his move was totally disconnected from your making BRITH as the best move you could make. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: CHILLSU O6 CULLIS +33 336
#note With precisely this sort of move! What a move. CULLIS we weren't sure of, but it was in, and does a perfect job of making it seriously hard for him to now win. This is what playing Elise does for you! 10 Days Later: Yep, CULLIS was brave - good risking. CHI is a better move though if you're prone to playing phoneys in time pressure or games slipping - imagine if CULLIS had been challenged off and he plays a bingo down O, and you have no time to come back. CUSH, CHILLI (with two L's), LEUCH, LICHI, SULCI, CHIELS, CHILES are new words here.
>Lenny_Moir: EV F9 .VE +14 230
#note Yet more weak play - he must have had poor rack management going on, and wasn't willing to change out.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEHNORS L1 HORA +28 364
#note And look at this! I stick an H brazenly into the triple column to further advance my own score. I'm keeping ENS so you never know what will happen if he tries to play left of the H. 10 Days Later: I instantly see HOARSEN but my earlier play leaves it unusable. To frustrate him further another rackrifice would be appropiate: HENS/HE/RE/IN/MOZES near closes the entire board scoring 44, and leaves barely any spots of value for him to use. But I credit myself indeed for not playing scared in any way here. Since his only chance to win comes from bingos this is entirely justified here. L3 HAEN is a new strong words too. Though to be fair all the top choices are giving me 99% winning chances so I can't criticise HORA since it scores.
>Lenny_Moir: BDEMNU 3G NUMB..ED +34 264
#note It's a nice score, but it's tantamount to playing the lottery - he might get a bingo but he won't win like this. Smaller plays that have a punch are called for especially if he has DEMN on his rack. Something like M3 ERM/MUD for example or even NUMBED, just avoiding my being able to close down the lane a bit more easily.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEGIINS 4F DIG +14 378
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEGIINS --  -14 364
#note My first phony in this tournament is a result of time trouble. I have long known that my observation sometimes goes out the window in such situations but I kept calm because of the 100 pt lead. I now see the superior DIS(H)ING for 36 which eliminates all danger. In fact there's the tripletriple DINGHIES available! I'm almost grateful I didn't play that in my first game, if I'd scored over 530 I'd have never heard the end of it.
>Lenny_Moir: AKR 1L .ARK +33 297
#note So that's a negative swing of 60 points right there. The effects of phonies, secondarily affected by lack of time - no wonder I practised 20 0 online.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEGIINS 2F DIG +14 378
#note Accordingly this is a bit of a risk - there's a blank unseen, as well as AEGNT. What if he bingoes from A1? I am then haemhorraging points and have to find a perfect endgame. This is a very weak move. Play INSIDE/EN instead if you're confident but there are a lot of heavy tiles left. This would be a spot to have a deep think. DEG/NE/UG would be worth it, the 2nd row is untouchable and I can just slowly play off my tiles. 10 Days Later: This last part is rubbish, NE has plenty of hooks. DIG does fine because the odds of him having a bingo that goes from A1 are low and the game will be mine anyways. DINGIES apparently also plays here lol. MOZED (verb)/DIG for 23 also does fine, but DIG was a lock move, good job.
>Lenny_Moir: AQT 1E QAT +18 315
#note Thankfully for me he had to eat the Q so I got to focus on greedy endgame tile-dumping. He should play Q(IN) to hope for an -S bingo.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EINNSVY 4C VINES +20 398
#note Most moves win so it doesn't matter what I played on that level. Strongest is NEVI/TINE/GUV/MI for 30. ISATIN, INBY, SYEN, ESNE are new.
>Lenny_Moir: EF 5D FE +19 334
>Daniel_O'Dowd: NY 11E Y.N +12 410
#note Missing Y(EA)N/BY/EN for 4 more points. A very polished first game!
>Daniel_O'Dowd:  (?GG) +8 418
