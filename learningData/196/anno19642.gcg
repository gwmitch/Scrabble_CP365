>Jennifer: AAEILNT G4 TALE +26 40
#note Ugh. Huge miss here. ALIENATE is one of the few 8's that I actually do find in Zyzzva. Didn't see it here.

>Jennifer: ACINPRS 12B SCRAPIN. +78 118
>Brian: AEP H12 .APE +18 60
>Jennifer: CDFHRSW E10 WH.RF +28 146
#note Quackle prefers DWARF in the same spot here. I like that better and would have played it if I had seen it, as CHS is a much better leave than CDS.
>Brian: BDETU B10 BU.TED +30 90
>Jennifer: ?ACDDES 3A CADDiES +75 221
#note Um, Quackle prefers I dump DE at A14 and hold ACDS?. I take my bingos when I see them.
>Brian: AOZ 2B ZOA +52 142
>Jennifer: BDELOTY 1D BOLTED +45 266
#note Quackle pferes BOTEL to hold the DY leave. I briefly considered #BOYED but didn't think it was good. It isn't (in TWL).
>Brian: OW A14 WO +29 171
>Jennifer: AEIOSTY A3 .OYEST +36 302
>Brian: ?EIITUV 14H .UnITIVE +74 245
#note OMG. I did not realize until just now that *PUtITIVE is phony. It's a word in legal land! I feel like I always run into trouble with legal and neuro words, the ones I should know best.  The correct bingo would have been PUnITIVE.
