#note Saw the only playable bingo, but was only ~75% sure.  Since the nonbingo isn't that much worse, I didn't want to play the high variance game of "possibly lose a turn, possibly gain a turn".  I also miss REDUX for some extra pts and better leave.

#note Too much bingo defense, or just right?  Favoring defense is the fact that Juraj has gotten very low on time.  The longer I block, the more his clock ticks, giving me a huge edge.

#note Maybe BOATE(R) to force bingos that end in A.  But now he has 4 tiles of turnover into a drecky pool.  Going for pts/equity is okay, giving me chances to outrun Juraj.
