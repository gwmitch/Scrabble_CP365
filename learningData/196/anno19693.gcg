#note S(H)ARIF is nice. I can't remember if CHOPIN takes the back E. In-game, I decided it didn't so I set up my S for a big play here.

#note This was a really rough turn to me and at the end of the game I was pretty sure I had made the wrong decision. Emptying the bag now stops Paul from fishing for a bingo and making a setup play. That seems like something I want to do after BO - he seems very bingo-prone and I don't want to allow him the extra shot. There are several marginal lines open and he has the ability to create more really tough-to-block lines with his next play by dropping a tile beneath TWAINS. So I'm hoping he's missed a bingo here. 

That being said (and I do think that emptying is the right philosophy), *how* I empty is important. ARIA doesn't score much and doesn't hold well. But I don't really see other things to do that don't open bingo lines. Maybe AWARE in the same spot, but I liked how ARIA stops cheap plays like (W)OVE. I forgot ARIA took the front V for VARIA though.

#note Whoa, was *not* expecting the last 5 in the bag to be vowels.

#note I am not sure of VARIAS (good) and SARC* (no good) but I need to block that sequence.
