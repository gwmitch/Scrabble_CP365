>Jerry: ?ABGHIO 15D BIGOs +75 101
#note jerry's actual rack. a few plays sim reasonably - best is BIOGS to set up the HA, but SAHIB, BIGOS, SHOGI and BIOGAS are not that far off.
>JD: AEEIIUY 9G E.U +23 92
#note pretty much a dead heat on the sim between ECU and exchanging. best exchange is actually to keep Y, which is cool. I figured I had a good enough chance of being bailed out with a WAXY play next turn to make it worth playing through.
>Jerry: HO G12 OH +23 124
>JD: AAEEIIY -AAEII +0 92
#note I was able to recognize that my best exchanges involved keeping the Y. from there it's difficult to choose between keeping Y, AY and EY - EY is a better leave than AY in a vacuum, but in this particular situation there are more ?AY plays than ?EY. the sim is within a half-point on all three.
>Jerry: DEL 10F DE. +14 138
#note he can also play DEWAX here
>JD: ?AEIPWY J6 WAY +34 126
#note my obvious play of WAY is now problematic due to him playing DEL, which screams that he has a bingo leave, and possibly an S (or an A for AWAY, for that matter). I figured at the time that I had no alternatives, but if I I think he has a 40+% chance of bingoing then I can play WE at I13, still leaving myself WAXY for next time (and a bingo about 30% of the time per quackle). In the end, I thought the range of racks he could have to play DEL was sufficiently wide that it was worth playing WAY.

#note wow, good thing I didn't have to find (A)CET(I)FIER! a challenge here would've been nice, I was pretty sure this was good. tears the board wide open

>Jerry: AHO A13 HAO +34 406
>JD: DLRSTUY O12 .ULY +24 375
#note this was a bad spot. there are very few vowels left. it would be nice to keep the D open, because he will most likely block the E next turn. I don't really have new lanes that I can threaten to make. in a sense, I'm waving the white flag by not creating a new threat. Quackle comes up with a lovely idea - TYRED at A3 to threaten LUTZ if I draw the Z. it seems worth trying something like that and trying to bait an error.

#note not much to be done unfortunately
>Jerry: GI N3 .IG +5 439
>JD: DERSTTV M12 ..V +6 393
#note I was fishing for DOTTERS due to a lack of apparent alternatives (presumably he has the O), but now I see some alternatives. Playing VET here actually gives me a nice chance of hitting some 9s through -RE-: SPATTERED or ROISTERED. ROISTERED would be especially dangerous because I would also have STORIED at O3, but again I'm not likely to draw the O. I can also play DEV and just hope that he misses TERATISM.

#note I started to go heavily overtime. DIKERS is a sweet play at the top that I missed, this is second
