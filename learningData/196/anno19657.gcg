>Daniel_O'Dowd: DFOOPR 8H PROOF +28 28
#note So game 6 was very enjoyable, it went quite smoothly for me but this wasn't due to Sam, who played finely. It helped that I got a good score on the opening. 
>Samantha_Beckwith: DEEGIN L8 .EEDING +24 24
#note This is an overly defensive move, surely. It's the other end of my style of play which dictates that if in doubt, score greedy - but that's within the diktat of needing enough tiles to bingo with the next turn. Why not PROOFING for example, which would really show me up? 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEEGNOV I4 GOVE.NED +65 93
#note I remember spending a while here, before finding GOVERNED, looking at things like VEGO. Another new word is VEGGED, and there's DOVED, OVENED, DOVENED.
>Samantha_Beckwith: AEHP J10 HEAP +33 57
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ADINOQR J2 QAID +40 133
#note This game was the antithesis of round 5 - the tiles were flowing for me quite clearly. Quackle prefers QIN/PI for 14 less keeping ADNOR which doesn't make so much sense to me. 
>Samantha_Beckwith: EEUU 2J .UEUE +28 85
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ANNNORS 1L ANON +22 155
#note The game is going nicely for both players - The Q helped her solve her vowel crisis which in turn boost-scored my N dump. NONAS and ANNO, and ANAN, and SUNNA are new. This is best though.
>Samantha_Beckwith: CET K4 TEC +22 107
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EINORRS 14D IRONERS +73 228
#note A second bingo this early on really lifted me high, and there was no way I was risking FEEDINGS.
>Samantha_Beckwith: ILTT 15A TILT +18 125
>Daniel_O'Dowd: FIRSSWX H13 W.X +39 267
#note The advantage of the positioning of my move was that it left two triples open, nevertheless, I was lucky here. Since this highscores, nothing is superior. FIXIT and FRIS are new as is WISS.
>Samantha_Beckwith: UY M13 YU +23 148
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AFINRSS M6 IFS +21 288
#note Again I was making strong effort to keep the best leave. Quackle shows new word FRASS/NYS/GUS for 46, then prefers YUS/SIF for 24 as defensivism. DEAD/ANI/PINY/ANI for 30 is also valid apparently, but I'm already a 98% favourite anyways.
>Samantha_Beckwith: ?EIIRST N9 wIRIEST +80 228
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AADLNRS N4 LAD +15 303
#note 90% lol. CNIDA is a new five. ADDEND across 11 is best, because it makes some more openings. 
>Samantha_Beckwith: HOW O7 WHO +28 256
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEGNRST E7 STRANGE. +68 371
#note Certainly she can score, but that's partly cos I'm letting her, and powering ahead with bingos! ESTRAGON is also there, and GRANTERS is valid.
>Samantha_Beckwith: AMZ 13B MAZ. +42 298
#note Yet another superbeefy score, this is a real heavyweight clash.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ACEMORT A10 COMA +27 398
#note So it's time to start closing things down. COMART, OMERTA are better, CREMONA, CAMOTE, COMATE are also new.
>Samantha_Beckwith: ABLO 8A BLOA. +24 322
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ABEJKRT 7C JE.T +38 436
#note Top kek. KSAR is new. BRAK too.
>Samantha_Beckwith: UY F10 YU +28 350
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ABKR 9B AB +24 460
#note JOB/BRR is slightly stronger aparently, as is the new five ARIKI through 3 disconnected letters lol. KNUR also new.
>Samantha_Beckwith: ?IV G5 VIs +16 366
>Daniel_O'Dowd: KR 5M K. +17 477
#note What a great game :D
>Samantha_Beckwith: IL 9G LI. +8 374
>Samantha_Beckwith:  (R) +2 376
