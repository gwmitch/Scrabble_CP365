#note The cool thing about the Memphis club is that all kinds of people just drop by!  This night Dan and his wife Joyce were in town (something about Joyce avoiding her parents :D) and hit us up!  I never played Dan before but I met him at Nationals this year so I was excited!

#note This play is not Tasha-like because it demonstrates unusually good board vision for me.  But it's also Tasha-like* because it rightfully ignores Dan's fishing.   I dismissed any plays on column C (E hook to TUI) because row 14 is also available.   Playing on column C also leaves column B open.  The pool has a lot of vowels and with a blank, Dan could easily bingo with a word starting with a vowel if I play something silly like C2 GREAT. Unless I play to the right of the S in CETANES, any blocks on row 14 would just open up the board further.  The pool looks pretty and I'm sure Dan has the blank by now so he's going to bingo regardless.  I shouldn't be pussy-footing around when I should be scoring instead.  Over-the-board, I felt that the only bingos that would hurt a bit would be C1 HEIFERS and A14 FLASHIER.  FH bingos = bad.  Anything else = who cares?

#note Meh, who cares? :D If I were Superman, I would have played 14D SLAG last turn.
