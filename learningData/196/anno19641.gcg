>Daniel_O'Dowd: FIRSTTT 8G TIT +6 6
#note So, IRST is a nice fragment. FIRST isn't worth the leave or score. I contemplated RIFT /STT but I didn't want to get bogged down in such things early on. It does leave nice healthy floaters though and TT is hardly the worst duplicate. I did also contemplate changing but then what do I leave? I logically wouldn't be able to change while keeping I because any 3 tile leave is vulnerable to a duplicate, RST is prone to bad pickups spoiling things, and ST is not keeping rack control. F is a nice tile to have on second moves too, so the modest start of TIT it was. 10 Days Later: Playing TIT as a security is a fine idea - basic ABC Scrabble. I note the ideal FRITT is playable and I'm not so sure about playing TIT over changing since changing keeps a vowel and this move doesn't - somehow I totally didn't think in the game about having one vowel only here (VC in general was a bit weak at times as a low priority). So I think I would do better changing to leave IST to maximise E pickups and stuffs, though Quackle prefers to keep IRST for obvious reasons. Furthermore it's quite possible that FIT is a better opening move, by score (+6) and since T is better than F in a single duplicate as far as bingos and shizzle. In fact FIT comes top after 4 ply simulation, and then the changes, so TIT was the sort of weak move I am sometimes prone to play because I am afraid to change out with risk. Keeping IRST or playing FIT would be far better - I guess keeping F was my idea of positional aggression in the same vein to game 1.
>Sylvia_Swaney: DIN 9F NID +11 11
#note If she's playing off such letters she either has duplicates or is trying to be slightly defensive. Probably just getting rid with a high probability four-set.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AFNORST 10F OF +17 23
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AFNORST --  -17 6
#note Phony number 2, surprisingly; despite my looking at all 3s I listed on the train. I was aware we were in a bingo-arms race but the comedown of 3hrs sleep had started I guess. I imagine that was part of her idea with NID - make it harder to score. FID is good - so FANO is possible, though a bit loose. Maybe F(ID)O keeping ANRST is ok. I now see (NID)OR/TO as well, keeping AFNST, and anticipating a long war. 10 Days Later: I still play phony 3s online, I need to get advice about it because besides bingo knowledge the phony 3s are my biggest weakness. Quackle gives me the advice to play FID/FAN (keeping ORST) for 17 as points grabbing. FON/NO/TIN also plays well, or F(ID)O as I suggested. Or just FID/FA. I guess I should look at a list of ALL the x-letter 3s and absorb them in to my head anew for a few days at a time, then cardbox myself on 3s, just try to reinforce those so much that I never have to think about phonies. FARO/FORA are new.
>Sylvia_Swaney: ABNR 7H BARN +16 27
#note Not so risky a move as it looks really, a five starting in a vowel from the N is not so easy to come by, and it's clear she has a good set of letters if she's playing RN off.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AFNORST 6F FRAT +25 31
#note And finally my game starts to scoring. 10 Days Later: Is there merit in NA/AFROS? I doubt it, S for 13 this early is too much though predictably Quackle has a cum at it. Humans aren't quite knowledgeable enough to burn S like that. FON/NO/TIN for 15 scores highly too because of ARST but I was probably on balance right to get my game going with the higher scoring move. NONFAT and FANON are new.
>Sylvia_Swaney: ?AILOSZ L1 ZOrILAS +107 134
>Sylvia_Swaney: ?AILOSZ --  -107 27
#note So she plays ZOrILAS* and I had seen it that morning in cardboxing ZORIL, and knew it took two L's, so I challenged it off. :D Instead of this move, NA/AZOnS at minimum gives a 51 point score. ZOA/OF/AR for 31 leaving ILS? is superior, more aggressive yet is AZO(N) leaving yourself the L hook for 26, and an ILS? leave. But AR is easily hooked so AZON would be a mistake. Quackle shows OZALIDS, and the newish 5 AZIDO as an improvement for 71 keeping LS. AZLON, AZOIC, AZOLE are also new. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AFLNOSY 10D FLY +30 61
#note Seeing she had two good spots for Z, I didn't worry about passivity, I simply got back into the game. 10 Days Later: I evidently either didn't spot or care about her playing AZOnS (blank plus S not important with huge scores regardless, since unlike bingos you preserve good tiles here, which is a more threatening situation). What's wrong with playing NO/OFAYS? It scores 47! That's 17 for an S and LN to leave, there is no bingo through A Y or S with those letters. Presumably I disliked the idea that she would reply ZA/ZA/AY for 47, but I think this is a better idea. Still if I was concentrating on playing my own game to avoid sitting sunk in thought I can't criticise a 30 point play that leaves ANOS. Well, basically, FLY lets her play AZONS saying "hey, I'll give you your high score anyways so I can maximise my own score", whereas OFAYS says "I see you have Z?S, I'll trade off one turn where you have to get rid of your Z for 0 score (meaning she lost a full turn value), and I keep a meaningless lead". Hm, I can entirely understand why I did this as I did, even with AZONS in the air. A computer would play OFAYS but the value difference is less than 0.5: On balance I played the stronger move for me. This is good to see! :) Quackle after thought plays OFAYS and finds FONLY/NY where I played FLY, for more points. FLAY is also valid. 
>Sylvia_Swaney: ?AILOSZ 5E ZOA +31 58
#note So she misses or doesn't want to play AZONS (AZIDO is stronger). AZIDO 84.6, AZOnS 72.5, ZOA 69.7, then a 4 ply sim. ZOA outranks AZONS on win percentage but AZIDO would be worth it still by 5%, or 10 points in the immediate. Partly due to floaters and score immediacy. In either case it's kinda moot, ZOA is not a critiscible move.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AEHNOST 11C HAO +21 82
#note HAO was a confident move - in fact HOA also plays too. ENST is an ideal leave and I'm scoring ok. Quackle prefers to open up with (F)OH or (F)OHN, which is a purer move for those who are more confident on that many AENST-containing bingos. AHENT to the triple, HOER, and HONER are new. Most of Quackle's preferred moves are slightly rack-pure; but if in doubt go for points.
>Sylvia_Swaney: ?IILNSU 12C INSULIn +84 142
>Daniel_O'Dowd: CEENRST 11H TENRECS +71 153
#note And I am immediately rewarded with my first bingo of the game too. I imagine I chose to play above INSULIN to avoid the E falling below a DWS square. That's an odd one frankly - below seems better to me today. 10 D L: I imagine also the idea was that (TI)??? was harder to exploit on a triple word score than ?(IT)??, which to an extent is true. Perhaps that was the effect of my lack of sleep kicking in a bit, since it's my first truly defensive move. But what stopped me playing CENTRES/BARNS for 10 more points? Perhaps the same thing - in the first game that wouldn't have bothered me at all, but now even it doesn't, I gain the DLS so any threat to the triple is nicely neutralised surely. I note after analysis that CENTRES is valued at 83 where CENTERS leaving a hotspot is valued at 77 - important. CENTNERS is new, and is a doubledouble. Quackle agrees about TENRECS being better below as well - this is clearly the sleep thing coming into play and affecting me.
>Sylvia_Swaney: DENOOW 4G WOODEN +28 170
#note I guess she was having trouble finding a concise high scoring move. At any rate I was reasonably calm in this game.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ACEIJRW 3I JAW +46 199
#note It was a nice pickup but still, CEIR is a perfect leave, and her hotspottery laxity lets me score big to take the lead after our shaky start. Couldn't risk JAWER* or something lke that. Quackle shows WICE, WICCA, JEWIE, and ACCREW as new words, but agrees with JAW of course
>Sylvia_Swaney: EEGP 2J GEEP +26 196
#note I challenged this, and wondered whether EGAD was valid in singular.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ACEIMRX 12K EX +38 237
#note But first I had the X to play off. And the score overrides any concern about the A v E leave debate, since I took over the initiative two turns ago. Quackle shows some improvements :) First off, MAXI/IGAD! MACE/HIC/FANE for 39 is also superior. AMICE/EGAD, and L8 CIMEX, or N9 CASEMIX. 
>Sylvia_Swaney: GHNO 1L HONG +49 245
#note HONG I also challenged, it's one of the newer playable 4s and is a nice score - clearly her own hand in the setup, and not a bad idea it wasn't either. If I had more time I could have considered a bit more over whether to play up there with P first or not, which seems clearer here, but I did right in the game to keep my clock going. Already in this game I finished with time, a huge achievement. 10 Days Later: You were focused on your own score not stopping her own, nothing wrong with that.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: ACDIMRU 8K UMIAC +38 275
#note I played UMIAC?! I knew that it's the alternative spelling of UMIAQ without ever having played either, just through cardboxular osmosis? I didn't even blink about playing it! Fucking hell. This 3 hrs sleep thing is almost becoming a guarantee of greatness! I wasn't afraid to rackrifice either - DR is a fine leave fragment and I'm removing the vowel imbalance. Quackle finds nothing else of note. MUIR, MUSCID, MAUD, DUCI, DUAR are new.
>Sylvia_Swaney: Q M7 Q. +21 266
#note Invariably players at this level seem to also struggle with the power tile dumping problem, just as the 1100s do online. It's one thing I don't do, I am far better as we see in later games on when to dump for Q draws and when to just play it off.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: DEEILRS N4 REDI.L +22 297
#note So not sure of EGAD, I considered it a mutually negative space, and it's the only opening on the board. I wasn't sure of RESLIDE* enough to justify trying it (which I would have no hesitation in doing since a bingo there would be near a game killer). But REDIAL is a great find, I usually have a lot of trouble scoring high with small tiles, but I'm forcing her to open up at risk here. 10 Days Later: I can understand this move but it's odd how at the end of a game humans can be diametrically overdogmatic about having to close, despite being able to play rackrifices with abandon earlier on. If I was struggling to score I have to approve the move, however, if EGAD is indeed the only opening, it would serve me to try RESLIDE*, since if EGAD is ruled out, then to win she will have to outscore me completely, but if it's good, it kills things. Quackle suggests plenty of superior plays. 13A LIEDER/HIE/FAND/LOSE/UR is new. GADI/IRE/EWER the same. HID/FANE/DE the same. DEIL is also new, REDE is new. GADDER too, with FRATE. Put simply there are lots of moves I couldn't know, scoring therefore was fine.
>Sylvia_Swaney: EV 5L EV. +8 274
#note Clearly a draw-fish, but I wasn't quite so worried. Perhaps I should have read into the move a bit more - to be fair though I was already under 5 minutes.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: EEILPRS 10I PIER +29 326
#note Again, this set of letters is just outside my current bingo knowledge, but PIER is a great parallel play that scores well and really pressures her to come up with the goods. Not much more you can do than that! Quackle shows superior plays based on new words and prefers PEEL to PIER for Win percentage but nothing of importance, and puts me 82% to win now because of the low odds of her finding an -E bingo which don't let me catch up.
>Sylvia_Swaney: EI O1 .IE +4 278
#note This is the sort of odd move I didn't expect to see from 120+ players. 4 points isn't justified. The only justification would be a positional, 3-4 tile rackrifice in row 1, scoring decently while making out like she's going to bingo straight away next turn, or, if she knows EGAD, make what looks like a desperation distraction play from the S down the bottom. It's a great shame I dont' know what her rack was - perhaps I can find out.
>Daniel_O'Dowd: BELMSUY 13A YUM +32 358
#note I decided that Y in the 13th isn't a dangerous thing to give away, I'm creating threats and scoring, and that's more important in case she DOES bingo up in 1. Quackle prefers BUM (ELSY is a decent fragment) but that sort of thing comes down to day-mentality. BLUME up top, another new word, would force her to take risks. But YUM does all you said it to, and it's a clear sign I wasn't playing passively yet.
>Sylvia_Swaney: OO 12N OO +5 283
#note Again, this is just not right - if you have bad tiles change; otherwise why not open up!
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AABEGLS A12 G.BE +36 394
#note More autoplaying here, not much needs to be said, except look at how I'm already after just 2 games, playing the same sort of Scrabble as I do online. No fear. No issues. I was apparently keeping S for bingo help and that's valid - the only higher ranked moves score no more than this. The interesting thing is just that playing In the A file guarantees a win apparently. A8 BASELY (stealing good tiles from draw I guess partly), A11 BA(Y)LE, SAGELY, ABYES, BAYES, and GAYAL are slightly stronger for win pec. But my move is second highest by score valuation which is the important criterion.
>Sylvia_Swaney: ?ADEIRT 1D RaDIATE +80 363
#note And the bingo finally turns up, 3 turns too late. Quackle suggests she tries for AD(Z) for 13 or R(EVE)T for 30. Presumably this is to do with me emptying the bag then her bingoing out. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AAKLOSV 13M AVO +20 414
#note AVO is a really nice play, I had even set up TIKAS on my rack here :D Quackle shows new words: ALKO's/LA/TIL/PENK/ERES. ASK in the same place. Prefers the immediate TIKAS because it dumps more tiles. I can be pleased having shown no time loss here though. AVO wins though and what's important is you calculated that for even if she went out and avoided going over on time.
>Sylvia_Swaney: STU L8 .U... +14 377
#note Granted, MUREX is a nice endgame find, but she had plenty of time she could have used to strategise earlier. She missed UTS/AT/SOVS for 22, reducing spread. 
>Daniel_O'Dowd: AKLS H11 ..KAS +27 441
#note What a great thing to be able to play TIKAS in an endgame. KAS/AA/SOVS was stronger but you were saving time. 
>Sylvia_Swaney: ST 13E ST +8 385
#note And her outplay misses ST/SOVS/OOT. So I was 2-0 after 2 rounds! Never would have believed that. And I didn't lose any time penalties in this game! Just 1 phony per game so far. The third game was my disaster.
>Sylvia_Swaney:  (L) +2 387
