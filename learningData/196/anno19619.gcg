#note The only play I considered was VODKA because it's the only play I could find that gets rid of the V and unduplicates the D and O. But I thought VODKA was stupid because it scores so little and Scott can blow me up at C9 next turn.  VODKA sims best, though.  Meh, HODAD's fine.

#note POLYPNEA sims slightly better, but it's not as cool as a word as PLAYPENS.  There's also two COLLINS bingos, but they don't score nearly as much and they're not as cool as PLAYPENS either.
