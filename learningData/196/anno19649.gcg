#note Need to keep the V for V(ACUITIES). Wasn't sure whether ELV or ENV was better. ELV "felt" better to me somehow but then I figured that the overall greater strength of the N would make ENV better. Quackle likes ELV by a bit more.

#note Thought about NIEVE and ENVOI here as well. EINS just seeme so good on this board (many bingo lanes few great scoring spotsthat don't open stuff), and against Dave in general, that I took this. I could do NIEVE so as not to open up a nice lane after OE, but there are already a lot of lanes and any bingo by Dave will open a lot for EINS so I like a more proactive strategy here. The three plays are all fine though.

#note Pretty ugly but the spot is too strong.

#note This is really bad. I was just amazed by how poor the options were here and also tired so I guess I didn't think this play through well enough. TYE is so much better.
