>Jason: EEJLMMT 8G MEM +14 14
#note Little FPS here. I somehow talked myself into the fact that EJLT was six better than EMMT. The obvious JET is the play. (-6.0)
>John_Luebkemann: ARUW 7H WAUR +18 18
>Jason: EJLTWYZ 9F WYE +30 44
#note WETLY is a little better, but this is OK. (-0.5)
>John_Luebkemann: AGGI 6E GIGA +15 33
>Jason: BEJLOTZ K5 BO.TZ +32 76
>John_Luebkemann: ES K5 .....ES +36 69

>John_Luebkemann: INN J10 .INN +13 82
>Jason: ?AAEILV 14G AVAILEd +75 179
#note In hindsight, I like Q's pick of VALI(D)AtE, which I passed on. (-6.6)
>John_Luebkemann: RXY 6K .RYX +30 112
>Jason: CEOOPRT H12 CO.E +36 215
#note I'm loving how this board is looking, esp. with a 100-point lead.
>John_Luebkemann: ?EINORS 15A INdORSE. +76 188
>Jason: IOPQRTV 14A QI +37 252
>John_Luebkemann: AEGIRST 12A AGRESTI. +74 262
#note John Luebkemann shouldn't need to pull a SATIRE rack out of the bag to beat me! Argh!
>Jason: KOPRTTV M2 PORK. +28 280
#note Q likes TR(E)K at L12. Didn't consider it. (-6.6)
>John_Luebkemann: HI 13L HI +17 279
>Jason: DLOTTTV A8 VOLT. +24 304
>John_Luebkemann: ACEH 8K .HECA +42 321
>Jason: DFLPRTT -DFLPT +0 304
#note Man, it was frustrating to go from three vowels to two vowels to one vowel to no vowels after the bingo while trading forehands with Looby. Given the 10-14 C/V ratio of the pool, I probably should've soldered on. Q likes FL(E)D or D(A)FT. (-6.8)
>John_Luebkemann: EINNOSU 9K .IN +24 345
>Jason: DLOOORT L1 ROTO +20 324
#note D'oh! Whiffed on TROD at 12L. (-4.3)
>John_Luebkemann: ADT 12L TAD +22 367
>Jason: DEEILOP 2J PO..ED +34 358
#note I spent at least 10 minutes on this play, I think. Q likes this, but I still don't see how it wins almost 30% of the time.
>John_Luebkemann: ANUU 1G UNAU +16 383
>Jason: BDEFILT 2A BEDLIFT +94 452
>Jason: BDEFILT --  -94 358
#note Had to try, even though I almost played the best play of FLI(R)T. Now he bingos out with FLANEU(R)S. (-108.0)
>John_Luebkemann: AEFLNSU 1N FE +29 412
#note Whaaaa...? -85 for missing the out bingo.
>Jason: BDEFILT E3 FID.ET +22 380
#note Missed FILBE(R)T. (-12.0)
>John_Luebkemann: ALNSU C8 LUNA.S +14 426
#note Took the free challenge. Frustrating. Played so good before the desperation phony, but it wasn't to be.
>John_Luebkemann:  (BL) +8 434
