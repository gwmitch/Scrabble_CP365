>Paul_Avrin: ?AEFLRU 8D FAiLURE +76 76
#note "Of course," I think.
>Jason: ADEERTT D8 .ATED +18 18
#note No spot for TREATED, grr. Missed (i)TERATED ... blank visualization problem, maybe? (-28.0)
>Paul_Avrin: AQ 10B QA. +32 108
>Jason: DEEEJRT J6 JE.D +28 46
#note Shoulda kept the D. (-7.5)
>Paul_Avrin: PT 9C P.T +17 125
>Jason: CDEEORT G8 .ECTORED +63 109
#note Paul held for literally six minutes. I wanted a challenge ... I used to read at Mass, Mass readers are lectors. We often used "lector" as a verb. "Your mom lectoring Midnight Mass again?" I might be asked. After the game, when I learned it was no good, I explained this to Frank. "That doesn't mean it's in the dictionary," he said, rightly enough. No real bingos.
>Paul_Avrin: ?EIPSTT 14B PEtTI.ST +72 197
#note "Of f***ing course," I think. (Keep in mind, I'm still thinking that him not challenging LECTORED* is a bad break for me.)
>Jason: CELNORX K5 COX +42 151
#note This, REX or LEX at 15A. Naturally, I picked the worst one of the three. (-3.1)
>Paul_Avrin: EGNOU 11G .ONGUE +14 211
>Jason: EKLMNRS 11C L.K +19 170
#note Missing MERK at 12L. (-5.8)
>Paul_Avrin: EGNV L10 V.NGE +18 229
>Jason: AEFMNRS 15A FEM +32 202
>Paul_Avrin: ADIV 15L DIVA +43 272
#note I was not a happy camper at this point, needless to say.
>Jason: AINRSWZ 9J .RAW +24 226
#note Never considered anything else; this scored and opened. Q likes WAR at 13A. (-3.1)
>Paul_Avrin: EW H11 .WE. +22 294
>Jason: AEIINSZ N6 ZEIN +42 268
#note Paul seemed surprised I was playing off an E, but what else? Nothing, that's what.
>Paul_Avrin: AENOR O4 ROAN +18 312
#note Paul played EARN at O5, said "No, I can't do that" (why?) and played this instead (why?).
>Jason: AAIILST 8M A.S +29 297
#note ILIA at N1 is a little better. (-1.9)
>Paul_Avrin: IIII -IIII +0 312
#note "I can't believe it ... I'm going to be behind," Paul said just before the exchange.
>Jason: ABIILTY 7M Y.. +23 320
#note Need to get rid of an I with two on my rack and four unseen. I(C)Y/Y(OWES) does that. (-5.8)
>Paul_Avrin: ARY 13A YAR +27 339
>Jason: ABIILLT 13L .ILL +10 330
#note Why not (G)LIB? I think I want to keep a high-pointer in the situation, but I'm not sure. I like (G)LIB now. (-4.9)
>Paul_Avrin: OS 10N SO +20 359
>Jason: ABBIRST F4 RABB. +14 344
#note I felt like I needed to open the board to win. BAB(U) is better. (-12.1)
>Paul_Avrin: INO E3 ION +12 371
#note Still have hope...
>Jason: HIIMOST D1 HIST +30 374
#note Whiffed on the front hook to OWES again. (C)HI is best, winning half the time, as does I(C)H. (-17.7)
>Paul_Avrin: EGHINUU 3J HUEING +27 398
>Paul_Avrin: EGHINUU --  -27 371
#note Bunch of wins, obviously.
>Jason: IIMOO O12 I.I. +5 379
#note Only one win here, (H)OMO wins by one. I was down to like :30 after the challenge, though, Paul about a minute. I saw I(L)I(A) as an out, but that's blocked with (L)U(V), so I did that first, not realizing I needed to block plays through the H. (-9.0)
>Paul_Avrin: EGHINUU 3K HUING +25 396
>Paul_Avrin: EGHINUU --  -25 371
#note His wins are fewer, but still there. (H)EIGH, HIG(H) win. HUN(H) ties. Paul pointed out that I should've let this go because I have a better spot for MOO. Nice of him to say two minutes into the post-mortem, I had about :15 post-ILIA.
>Jason: MOO G2 MOO +10 389
#note MOO(R) or MOO at N2. But whatever. I escaped and that's all that matters. Let the comeback begin!
>Jason:  (EGHINUU) +22 411
