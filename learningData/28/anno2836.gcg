>Mason_Shambach: PY C11 Y.P +40 99
>Jason: EHINTUZ L11 .ITZ +28 182
#note Considered NU(D)ZH, but wanted to keep the H for J10 plays. More FPS. (-12.7)
>Mason_Shambach: AEJRS J4 RAJES +36 135
>Jason: BEEHINU J10 H.BE +30 212
#note This won me a POO list, though it shouldn't have. I went to the bathroom before the prize ceremony, and as I walk in I hear Jeffrey Nelson say "tailskid", which was odd. I put this down, but then Adam Logan scored 45 for WAZOO. When he realized his mistake, I offered to return it, but he said I could keep it. Anyhow, I should've played (Z)EBU. (-9.2)
>Mason_Shambach: DE 14L .ED +26 161
>Jason: EGIINSU O11 GUISE +35 247
#note I played this very quickly and Mason (1-6 in the EB and 0-3 coming into this game) said "You gotta be kidding ... oh."
>Mason_Shambach: IIII -IIII +0 161
>Jason: AEHINOQ K5 HO +29 276
#note Surprised Q likes playing the N for only four more. (-7.4)
>Mason_Shambach: AEMNNRS 14D MANNERS +75 236
#note I almost held Mason on this. "MANNERS, MANNERS ... people that man?" I figured it out while he was counting, and when I told him after the game, he laughed.
>Jason: ?AAEINQ L4 QI +28 304
>Mason_Shambach: EF 15G EF +32 268
>Jason: ?AAENTX 10F AX +25 329
#note Thought this was a no-brainer, but Q says to play it at 15D for one less. Huh? Why shouldn't I open a lane with this leave? (-1.8)
