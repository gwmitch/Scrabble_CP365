>A: IMNNOOX 8G NOX +20 20
#note Best.
>Dewin: AAEEGOY 7G AYE +26 26
#note Best.
>A: GIIMNOR 9H MOI +25 45
#note Best even though MO is more defensive.
>Dewin: AAAEEGO -AAEG +0 26
#note Best.
>A: GINNRSW J2 WRINGS +29 74
#note I lost 7 equity here with the 2nd best move. The power of fishing is supreme here. EXON would give me 6 7s if I picked up the correct tile. With floaters, the number ups to 50. 50 is too good to be true!
>Dewin: AEGGMOT 3H MO.TGAGE +76 102
#note Best.
>A: EILNOTU 4B OUTLINE +71 145
#note I don't care what Quack says. This IS the best placement.
>Dewin: IOPPRSV O1 PR.P +33 135
#note The new POEP would be my choice and it wins handily. The plays keep fluctuating because our scores are close but I have to stop the sim at 824 iterations else I'll be stuck here. PREP, the 4th best move, loses by 5 points. 10F PIP, H1 VOMER are valued similarly to PREP but beat it based on Win %. [PREP]ARED and others are a threat.
>A: ABEIINS L1 BI.AE +22 167
#note BIGA beats BIGAE/BAGIE by 4. I thought the EINS synergy didn't matter much here compared to the 2 extra points, but I was wrong. I took 2 minutes 45 seconds for this play and still didn't make the best move. Sigh.
>Dewin: ADIOSTV B2 AV.ID +26 161
#note For a while, 10J DIVOT took the lead and I assumed it was due to Quack's unbridled attacking style. B2 OVOID wins after 429 iterations. B2 AVOID is 2nd, 2.5 points behind. 
>A: AAFINSS H1 FA..S +30 197
#note 703 iterations and 10J FAINS wins by 0.2 over FAMES. I didn't like FAINS because it opened, but...it suits Quackle's style I guess. I do have the S and can immediately capitalize on IFS, but I prefer a similar score, an okay leave of AINS and a more locked position. I took only 1 minute for this because I thought it was obvious enough, but I was wrong.
>Dewin: CELNOST F2 CO.N +12 173
#note Dewin was doing well until now. COIN is out of the top 10 and sims 11.4 behind. A5 TELCO is easy to miss, as is A6 ONCET (3.2 points behind). A simple 10I NOT is 3rd, 5.6 points behind but I don't advise that. I would miss the top two choices and go for CLON K8 (5.2 points behind NOT, 4th in sim) to 'mix it'. 10I NO (7.4 back) and K8 CLOT (6.9 back) round up the top 6. I think CLOT might be safer but it is easier to bingo with CLONE after the opponent takes the A8 triple.
>A: AAIINOS E3 I.IA +14 211
#note I rushed through this move and paid the price. After 847 sims, ILIA is 5th, 6.4 points behind A6 AIA. AIA is obviously best because it takes the elusive triple, leaves a nicer INOS and gives a new bingo line in return of the one it takes. Surprisingly, AIA A5 is 2nd, 2.5 points behind A6 AIA!!! A6 INIA is 3rd despite the sucky AOS leave, and K5 AI is 4th. ANOS is really a sucky leave and I should have noticed it.
>Dewin: ELLNSTU M3 .LL +7 180
#note After 865 iterations, M3 ALL is 9th (not in original list), 9.1 behind K9 LUNT. K9 LUNET is 2nd, 0.7 behind. K9 TULLE, 3rd and 1.3 behind, is new to me.
>A: ANOORST A6 OON +12 223
#note Missed SANTOOR! And it's not even new. ALL telegraphs a bingo, so I blocked with OON. I lost 45.9 equity here. A5 OONT/TOON are 4 better than OON because of score, I suppose.
>Dewin: EENRSTU 10B RETUNES +70 250
>Dewin: EENRSTU --  -70 180
#note MOIT is good and Dewin failed to realize it. TENURES/TUREENS hooking MOI, or safer NEUTERS/TUREENS/TENURES D6 are the plays I'd consider.
>A: ?AERSTZ D6 pATZERS +83 306
#note I know K8 STAREtZ but I missed it. STARETZ doesn't give Dewin an advantage, by the way. Very fortunately, PATZERS sims highest.
>Dewin: EENRSTU N5 TENURES +64 244
#note Missing K9. It's a tough call right now for Dewin and if I were playing for him, I'd take my time to see if blasting the board open would pay off. Personally, I'd agree with Quackle and take the gamble with K9 TENURES (which leads the sim but valuation doesn't matter here because it's a gamble).
>A: ABEEFHR O6 FEH +49 355
#note FEH is obviously best but I just had to take my time. I'd pay for my slowness with the next move.
>Dewin: ?ADDITW M10 WADI +23 267
#note The blank! I will consider C10 WAID as a gamble once again, since if WAIDE is taken, I might be able to play in the 15th row. Right now, valuation is not much of an issue since winning is more important. WAID C10 leads by Win %, and WADI is quite far behind...about half the Win % of WAID. The VCVC arrangement also encourages parallel plays...so I'd rather WADD or WAID.
>A: ABDEEKR L7 REBAKED +102 457
>A: ABDEEKR --  -102 355
#note Couldn't afford to take my time. If I knew DEBARKED I'd play it straightaway, but I had to try REBAKED. :S:S:S
>Dewin: ?CDJLTV -CJLV +0 267
#note Guess he didn't know BERAKED. I was gonna say something mean but with the blank unseen to me, changing might be a good option for Dewin if he didn't already have the blank. Keeping CL? is best here. His leave of DT? beats LT? for reasons I don't know, but CL? wins by a mile over those two. 13L JILT squeezes in 2nd.
>A: ABDEEKR L7 BERAKED +102 457
#note The correct bingo.
>Dewin: ?DHOTTU 11B HU.T +14 281
#note C10 HOUT, N13 TUT, 11B THRU/HURT/TURD, N13 DUH are the only moves with a Win % greater than 0. I like HOUT because it opens better. HURT means your bingo must have S as the 3rd letter, but you'd lose anyway so you might as well bait your opponent to block with HOUT.
>A: CEJRUVY B8 YUC. +23 480
#note Wasn't sure of CHEVY. I know CORVETTE is good, but CHEVY?! Since CHEVROLET* is a brand and obviously no good, I thought CHEVY might just be a figment of my imagination. HAHAHAHA. I was running out of time and so decided to just score and take the win.
>Dewin: ?DEIOQT F9 QIs +20 301
#note 11J DIKAS is best, followed by 13L DIVE from me to block DIKAST!!!!!! Wow even I won't see that. That's the difference between me and say, Marcus or Hubert. :P
>A: EJLRV 2A J.RL +11 491
#note I was seriously low on time. How on earth does Pakorn do it man? JA 7C wins whether or not Dewin decides to milk his tiles.
>Dewin: DEOT E11 .OTED +8 309
>Dewin:  (EV) +10 319
