>David_Lewis: ADEOOR 8D ROADEO +16 16
>Jason: DEGIPQY F7 Q.ID +18 18
#note Again, I wondered if I made this play too fast. Very close, but Q likes G(R)IPEY. (-0.9)
>David_Lewis: AFGRT 7I GRAFT +17 33
>Jason: AAEGPSY 9I YAP +23 41
#note Q likes YAG by a bit. (-2.8)
>David_Lewis: ABP 10J BAP +27 60
>Jason: AEEGNOS 11H AGONE +31 72
#note Or GONE, leaving the hook. (-0.7)
>David_Lewis: AEIIIRT D3 RETIA.II +66 126
#note Nice find. And he's about to get rewarded for it.
>Jason: AEEMMST C2 MEM +22 94
#note Didn't know STEMMA at 12J. (-6.3)
>David_Lewis: ERUZ H11 .ZURE +72 198
#note Dammit! Almost sacrificed the five points to play MEM at 12F, too.
>Jason: AEEGSTT N5 GESTATE +72 166
#note Yay for bingos that only neutralize your opponent's Z-bomb. Q likes the other bingo, G(R)EATEST. (-1.3)
>David_Lewis: ADEFX O11 FAXED +56 254
#note When he played AX at O8 and picked it up, I knew I was in trouble.
>Jason: CELNNSS 12J SEC +36 202
#note Whoa! SENS(A) at 12K is awesome! (-4.1)
>David_Lewis: JKU 14L JUK. +30 284
>Jason: LLNNSTW -LLNW +0 202
#note After seeing Evans sim some games during/after the prize ceremony, I think we need to start a "I never make the exchange Quackle wants me to make" club. It says to keep ST. (-1.6)
>David_Lewis: BDLOO C9 BLOOD +31 315
#note David, I can't catch up if you keep scoring 30-some...
>Jason: CEINSTV 9M V.C +12 214
#note C(O)VIN at 12B or VINC(A) at K3. Can't just score 12, no matter what the leave, at this stage. (-3.1)
>David_Lewis: INVY 5J VYIN. +24 339
>Jason: EILNSST 15B SETLIN.S +59 273
#note Dammit! I considered C(O)T at 12B the turn prior; if I had, I could've played SNIVELS/S(COT) at A6 for 90! Instead, I only have this lameness.
>David_Lewis: ?AEINOT G1 tETANOI. +72 411
>Jason: EHIILRW 1D WHI.IER +48 321
#note I considered WI(t)HLIER* as a spread saver, but at 4-2 going into the last round, a lost challenge is this situation is really stupid. As it was, this was held but released. Q says HI at F2 wins very, very rarely. WHI(t)ER leads in valuation. (-3.1)
