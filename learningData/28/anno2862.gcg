>Ben_Schoenbrun: CEE 8G CEE +10 10
>Jason: AGNORSU J2 OURANGS +68 68
#note I'd looked at AGNORU, and thought "S would be nice." That was my week. Missed this vs. Cornelis in Pontiac; it stuck. I think I studied it shortly therafter, too.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AJSU 4H JU.AS +40 50
#note I thought this was good. Dammit.
>Jason: AAIRTTW K4 .WA +24 92
>Ben_Schoenbrun: CDNOR 2I C.NDOR +18 68
>Jason: AEIIRTT N1 I.RITATE +60 152
#note How different is this game if he plays CORDON?
>Ben_Schoenbrun: III -III +0 68
>Jason: ??IOOSS O7 OSmOsIS +76 228
#note That's kind of an embarrassment of riches. 8-for-8 in blanks Sunday and the best I can be is 2-2. Missed SOrOSIs for five overlaps and 82. (-8.0)
>Ben_Schoenbrun: AEHMNOR 13H MENORAH. +78 146
>Jason: ADEEOTV 12D OVATE +23 251
#note VETOED's a little better. (-4.5)
>Ben_Schoenbrun: EY N10 YE +27 173
>Jason: DEEGINO E10 GI.E +16 267
#note Missed IOD(I)N at 1K. Still, this play is pretty defensive, which is what I wanted to accomplish. (-)
>Ben_Schoenbrun: DH 1M H.D +26 199
>Jason: BDELNOW L8 BOWLE. +28 295
#note I played a lot of these boards during the week ... by now I'd become an expert at them.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: IRX H11 R..IX +42 241
#note Jeez, *nobody* lets me run and hide!
>Jason: BDENPTU 14G P.NED +19 314
#note Missed PUB/P(REMIX).
>Ben_Schoenbrun: KLPU G5 PLU.K +19 260
>Jason: BFMTTTU 13B FUM.T +26 340
#note Happy to see this ... nearly exchanged.
>Ben_Schoenbrun: ADIIO D6 OIDIA +11 271
>Jason: ABINTTV C7 BAT +22 362
#note Just trying to block the Q play, ensuring I'll draw it while in the bag. VAT at 14A leads in wins? No way. VITTA at C3 leading in valuation? That I can buy. (-14.2)
