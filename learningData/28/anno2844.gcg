>Jason: AEEEHLU 8F EAU +6 6
#note Didn't know LEHUA. Don't know why I didn't just play HUE. Or pass into EL. (-5.9)
>Joel_Sherman: EJZ F7 J.EZ +40 40
#note And I probably should've gone with the A-on-the-star placement. Other than that, EAU's fine. (rolls eyes)
>Jason: AEEHLLV G8 .HA +30 36
#note Again, against super-experts, I'm going to try to gum the board up when possible. Clearly best.
>Joel_Sherman: NY 10F ..NY +16 56
>Jason: AEELLVX 11I AXEL +27 63
#note I considered VEX/(EAU)X, but this scored two more and I liked the leave better. (-6.4)
>Joel_Sherman: DKOU 12I KUDO +44 100
#note OK, now I see why VEX wins sim...
>Jason: AELRRSV -RV +0 63
#note R(ED) scores four and the leave is practically as good. (-3.8)
>Joel_Sherman: EEILNRW L11 ..RN +4 104
>Jason: ACELRRS 13C CARRELS +84 147
#note Know the CLEARS anamonic (PUCK STOPPER DOMINIK HASEK CLEARS WAIVERS), but it's been so long since I looked at that stem, I wasn't sure of the bingo. Something internally told me it was this and I was relieved it was unheld.
>Joel_Sherman: ANQT D10 QAN.T +28 132
>Jason: EEILLNO C11 LI.E +12 159
#note Given his last two plays, I'm trying to minimize S plays and score decently while keeping a good leave. NE(R)OL (didn't know it) at E11 is better on both counts. (-5.5)
>Joel_Sherman: GHIO 14J HO.GI +34 166
>Jason: ?CEELNO O9 ENCLOsE +86 245
>Jason: ?CEELNO --  -86 159
#note EChELON or COLLEEN at 15E ... *sigh*.
>Joel_Sherman: IITT 15G TITI +17 183
>Jason: ?CEELNO 14B C..E +14 173
#note EChELON(ED). (-18.6)
>Joel_Sherman: ORSVW M7 VROWS +28 211
>Jason: ?EILNOT 8L O. +3 176
#note I wrote TOENaIL(ED) down and just doubted myself, probably gunshy after HONGIS*. (-24.7)
>Joel_Sherman: DEGIU K5 GUIDE +18 229
>Jason: ?EIILNT 5D rETILIN. +66 242
#note "OK, Tile Gods," I thought with my hand in the bag, "bail me out from my stupidity." (-0.8)
>Joel_Sherman: GIIV H1 VIGI. +30 259
>Jason: ABEFNRS B10 FAB +24 266
>Joel_Sherman: DEOP A7 DOPE +26 285
>Jason: EMNOORS 2H .ONOMERS +74 340
#note In hindsight, MOONR(I)SE to be more defensive? I wondered. No, this sims almost 20 points better.
>Joel_Sherman: ABW 1K WAB +23 308
>Jason: AFMOPTT 4C FA +12 352
#note Looking at SYNURAE or DASYURE even with the blank in the bag, I knew I had to block B1 bingos. I like Q's pick of FOP, though. Limits the odds of outrunning and doesn't give him a chance to fish off the Y. (-4.1)
>Joel_Sherman: ?ADENRS O2 .ARDiNES +77 385
#note Joel said he picked the blank after WAB. I think Joel picked this bingo so he could make the blank "I as in Idalski". "I don't deserve to win this one and therefore I won't," I think. 
>Jason: EMOPTTU 3K PUT +33 385
#note TEMPT or TEMPO as 3B is four better.
>Joel_Sherman: Y 9E Y.. +9 394
#note Missing the 14-pointer, but that pales in comparison to my mistakes. I can't lose a game like this, when I outdrew him so bad. I just can't.
>Joel_Sherman:  (EMOT) +12 406
