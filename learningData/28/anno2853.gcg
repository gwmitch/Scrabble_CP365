#note this is ok along with a lot of others. The stand out play is D8 (P)AKEHA, but I didn't know it.
>jeremy_franks: DEINRST H3 NERDI.ST +60 91
>curley: AAEGHIR 10E A. +13 56
#note I wasnt keen on this. I wanted to keep the IG with the N open - Q likes scoring with HA i9 or 10b, or AH 10c, or AAH 10b are liked.  It's only 4% win back though. I'm still not sure of what I think is best here.

>curley: AEGHILR 3H .ARGILEH +76 132
#note Jeremy and I wondered which spelling would win out in a sim - it's this version by 0.1%.  I think I'd still do it this way despite what comes next.
>jeremy_franks: ??AEIOT O1 Ac.IOTEs +140 247
#note if i'd done it NARGHILE there would be no triple-triples.  The other one here is ATHETOID.
>curley: EEIIOQT 10B QI +37 169
#note only play worth considering
>jeremy_franks: BEFILOS N7 FOIBLES +74 321
>curley: EEINOTZ L1 ZE.N +46 215
#note Before Jeremy's move I was willing an M for ZONETIME/MONETIZE.    This play is best at only 2% win.
>jeremy_franks: LPW 12L PL.W +26 347
>curley: EEIORRT 1G EROTI.E +48 263
#note best, getting up to 3% win now.

#note the sime prefers getting rid of IF in various ways (eg 11b, 5d) leaving BUDER. I quite liked my play as it opened lanes up even though my leave wasn't amazing.
>jeremy_franks: EJV 12A J.VE +44 431
>curley: BEEFGOT A12 .EFE +58 375
#note This scores the most by far, but in teh sim A14 FE leaving BEGOT wins by a little.
>jeremy_franks: AST C12 .ATS +30 461
>curley: BGIORST K3 .IG +12 387
#note I left the worst leave here - GIRST is by far the most likely to bingo next leave (an 8% win).  The stand out play is F6 BO(RAX), closely followed by 2i BO or k3 (G)OB.  My leave of BORST just isn't likely to score enough.
>jeremy_franks: MY 5D MY +28 489
>curley: BHNORST A3 THROBS +51 438
#note with HN being in the bag, it turns out that my only bingo from the last rack would be THRONGS - so it turns out (G)IB would have been the winning play.
>jeremy_franks: CGLUUY L9 GUL.Y +11 500
>curley: N 6A .N +4 442
#note I had fun with this one - and Jeremy, it turns out VATS was 30, so you did make 500!
