#note WEB, 9H. (-2.7)
>Michael_Bassett: AIMRS 8K AMIRS +32 58
>Jason: EIILNTW 9K WIN +20 38
#note We talked about the game later, Michael saying "After I played this, I thought 'Oh, I'm putting an S in the triple lane against Jason Idalski, what have I done?'" I had no idea he knew who I was. Anyhow, is this too close-y? Sim likes this or WIT ... figured -ERS and RE- eights were still open. (-1.6)
>Michael_Bassett: ?CDITUV O1 VIaDUCT. +95 153
#note WHAT?!?!?!?!?! As I told others the story, I said "I thought I was having a bad dream!" Said George Viebranz, sitting next to me during the game, "I thought I saaw you pinching yourself after this play." "I was! I exclaimed. (Seriously, I was.)
>Jason: AEIILTT M8 ..ITIAL +14 52
#note Q likes fishing with TI at J9. (-3.9)
>Michael_Bassett: AZ N3 ZA +24 177
#note "OK," I tell myself, "He's going to have to make a play without a power tile eventually..."
>Jason: AAEENTT N7 A.ENA +22 74
#note Bad play. Missed A(ZA)N and EATEN at L11. (-9.9)
>Michael_Bassett: BOR 9E BRO +16 193
>Jason: AEEEQTT 12L Q. +22 96
#note Q calls this "Q panic" and suggests TEE at 10D. (-6.1)
>Michael_Bassett: OX E9 .OX +24 217
>Jason: AEEENTT D10 TEE +17 113
#note Leads in wins; EATEN at O11 leads in valuation. (-0.1)
>Michael_Bassett: ?DEIORS 13D SOlDIER +64 281
#note Esp. looking at this ugly board, I thought. "OMG. I'm going to lose. If he ever had respect for me, Winter (at the tourney) will think I'm a total loo-loo."
>Jason: AEEINTU O11 UNITE +21 134
#note ETUI at 10G leads in valuation. (D)UE has the highest win rate at .25%. (-0.3)
>Michael_Bassett: V 11C V.. +13 294
#note Not sure if this is a fish or defense.
>Jason: ADEEFMO 6G FOAM +33 167
#note Wasn't sure of DEFOAM. At this point, there's no way I can risk a lost turn. FEED(L)O(T) or FEED(BOX) would've been cool. (-7.4)
>Michael_Bassett: G H5 G. +3 297
#note Well, I gotta hope he keeps missing, obviously. I figure at this point if he just goes 15 a turn, he should be fine, esp. on this board.
>Jason: CDEERWY H12 W.RY +42 209
#note For the first time in the game, I make the Q-approved play.
>Michael_Bassett: EG I11 GE. +9 306
#note (Counted as 10.)
>Jason: CDEEELT 4F ELECTED +77 286
#note I remember having CDEEET and thinking "L! L!" It worked. Then I had to hope the spot stayed open. Don't know if he'll see the S- hook, but I better not hang it out there just in case. (-1.6)
>Michael_Bassett: GO G11 GO. +11 317
>Jason: DFHINNP N13 HIP +32 318
#note Because GEE was underscored, I have 318-318. I'm praising myself for getting back to even, then went "There's only 24 tiles left and he's on turn! Being tied is nothing to congratulate yourself on!!!"
>Michael_Bassett: E 15H .E +5 322
>Jason: DFHLNNU 3C FUND +19 337
#note Given the pool, I can see why he's fishing.
>Michael_Bassett: AR 15H ..AR +7 329
>Jason: AHKLLNS K3 L.K +14 351
#note Hey, S, thanks for coming. Trying to block OPIATES/O(DE), etc. Q likes 5C plays HALL or KHAN. (-4.5)
>Michael_Bassett: EI L4 .IE +10 339
#note Not giving himself a chance to out bingo. I can breathe again.
>Jason: AHLNOPS 5C PHON +22 373
#note (U)NLASH. (-14.0)
