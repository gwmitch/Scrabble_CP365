>Kevin_Colosa: ACIKMRS 8D KARMIC +38 38
#note Nice play. Kevin and Marci Mikesell's e-mail address is karmicvine, so it was doubly cool.
>Jason: ABHINPT 7E BAH +29 29
#note Should've added the T. (-1.6)
>Kevin_Colosa: AEY 9D AYE +23 61
>Jason: CEFINPT 10B FIT +21 50
#note Q says fish off the F at F6. I'll buy that. I certainly wasn't enamored with this play. (-2.8)
>Kevin_Colosa: EU I8 .EU +6 67
>Kevin_Colosa: EU --  -6 61
#note Put down (F)EU, picked it up to play E(C)U ... and just forgot to put the letters in the right place.
>Jason: ?ACEHNP 11A PANaCHE +90 140
#note Set to play ACHE/(KAT)A, I see P?N ACHE. Hey, PANaCHE! Oh, if only IP* played. Hey, wait, can I put the second A under KATA? Indeed I can. (-0.1)
>Kevin_Colosa: EERU A11 .UREE +24 85
>Jason: BJOUUVW 6F BOW +34 174
#note This is how the tourney went: Even when I pulled racks like this (which was seldom), I had spots to score and at least put off the exchange. Then I'd often draw well enough to prevent the exchange.
>Kevin_Colosa: LT G10 L.T +3 88
>Jason: IJORUUV H2 VROU. +12 186
#note Probably shoulda thrown back keeping R. No reason to open after that fish. (-2.6)
>Kevin_Colosa: DNOTU 3H .OTUND +16 104
>Jason: AEIJLSU N2 JAIL +30 216
#note I passed on JA(N)E ... this scored almost as much, kept the E, and didn't allow a cheap J play in response. It opens the triple, but he's just played off five. I stand by this play. (-6.6)
>Kevin_Colosa: GLP K2 G.LP +14 118
>Jason: AEEELSU O5 ALEE +14 230
#note EASE at 6L has a slight lead in win %, but this leads in valuation.
>Kevin_Colosa: DEENORS 15A .NDORSEE +80 198
>Jason: EEFIOSU 14G FOU +13 243
#note FEU at N8 is Q's pick. Maybe this was too defensive? (-3.7)
>Kevin_Colosa: MN 4G N.M +9 207
>Jason: EEIIOSX 13I XI +34 277
>Kevin_Colosa: NT 14G ...NT +14 221
>Jason: ?EEIORS L8 OREIdES +73 350
#note Missed OnERIES(T)/(XI)S. (-3.3)
>Kevin_Colosa: IQ K11 QI +45 266
>Jason: DEGIIOV N8 DIVE +19 369
#note I didn't think about killing the line with column M plays. IVIED at M6 is best. (-7.1)
>Kevin_Colosa: NSY O11 SYN +12 278
>Jason: GIIOOTT O1 GO +18 387
#note I can't believe TO instead helps my spread by an average of 23.5 points. But that's what Q says, so that's what the equity loss is.
>Kevin_Colosa: ARZ I8 .ZAR +25 303
>Jason: EIIOTTW K7 OWE +13 400
#note TWO, same spot, is three better.
>Kevin_Colosa: AADGS J1 GA. +11 314
#note AD at 14C is five better.
>Jason: IITT N13 IT +6 406
#note Thought I was blocking the best out, but he has 10 elsewhere. Take the extra two points with (H)IT or (IN)TI.
>Kevin_Colosa: ADS 13A .ADS +10 324
>Kevin_Colosa:  (IT) +4 328
