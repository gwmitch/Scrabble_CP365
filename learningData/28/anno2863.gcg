>Jason: EGILORS M2 GLORIES +74 144
#note Stuff you do when playing 41 games in five days. I count this play, say "24," and hit my clock. "Uh..." Mona said. I realized my mistake. "So those DO get a 50-point bonus?" I asked.
>Mona_Larsen: DEPU 2J PUD.E +30 164
#note Other stuff you do in your 41st game in five days: Let a phony go by which you KNOW is bad ... because you've had a conversation about "Pudge" Rodriguez' name being bad! I put this in, about to click "Commit," then go "Hey wait, this is phony!" grrr...
>Jason: DFIMUXZ D12 FIZ +40 184
#note Missed D(O)UX at 4L. (-)
>Mona_Larsen: AD 14B AD. +26 190
>Jason: DGMOUUX 1H DOUX +49 233
#note Now I see D(O)UX, but it's not the best play.
>Mona_Larsen: NRW 4L W.RN +26 216

>Jason: BEGHIST 15H BETHS +42 321
#note Missed BIGHTS. (-0.6)
>Mona_Larsen: Q 11K Q. +22 333
>Jason: GIINNTV 4A INV.TING +65 386
#note I saw INV, saw the N then thought "T for INVITING through that I." That was my week. But I kind of knew this was fool's gold unless I found a power tile on my pick.
>Mona_Larsen: ?ADEOSS 9B O. +4 337
#note Missing ADEnOS(E)S, SEASOnED (which I pointed out after the game), (I)SOlEADS and SEADOgS. But this is a guaranteed win.
>Jason: EEELOOT O3 O.E +3 389
#note First thing I saw was A(N)iSEEDS. Only things I was seeing off of OM were DEbASES and rESEDAS, both of which I thought it was reasonable for a 1400 to miss. So, deliberately sacrificing equity hoping for a choke job.
>Mona_Larsen: ?ADEESS A7 SEDAtES +80 417
#note Oh, that too. And others. An anti-climactic end to the week.
>Mona_Larsen:  (EELOT) +10 427
