>Pat_Hardwick: EEM C11 EME +20 46
>Jason: DHIILUU -DHIUU +0 20

>Pat_Hardwick: EJ 10F JE. +26 86
>Jason: EILNNOS G10 .N +2 25
#note This is not quite going the way I want. 25 through four turns is not exactly the "assert your superiority" strategy I was going for... NO at 10A? (-1.5)
>Pat_Hardwick: UX I10 XU +27 113
>Jason: EILNORS E2 LORINE.S +68 93
#note Don't know why I didn't play NEROLIS. Keeping the -S hook open, maybe? They sim close, this leading.
>Pat_Hardwick: APT B13 PAT +15 128
#note No fair! I can't play JASON*!
>Jason: AEGIQTY D1 QAT +26 119
#note GAI(L)Y for 34. I always want to pitch the Q too soon ... I'm getting better at not being so afraid of it. (-4.5)
>Pat_Hardwick: IM A14 MI +22 150
>Jason: EGHIKOY 6D I.KY +21 140
#note Didn't know BRAWLY. GOY at I6 is the play. (-9.6)
>Pat_Hardwick: DO C5 OD +16 166
>Jason: EEEGHOO 5G OGEE +10 150
#note Too gutsy with three S's out. Don't know what I was thinking. But Q likes it. Odd. Of course, Pat probably has an S by now ... I give her an S, this prolly gets whacked. (-0.1)
>Pat_Hardwick: OSU 1A SOU. +39 205
>Pat_Hardwick: OSU --  -39 166

>Pat_Hardwick: ?AAGSSV N6 SAVAGeS +76 284
#note Whoa. Nice find by Pat.
>Jason: AEENORT 8L RO.E +24 307
#note With two T's and a P out, this is gutsy, but Q agrees to a point. TROVE wins sim. (-1.1)
>Pat_Hardwick: DF 9M F.D +23 307
>Jason: AEENRTT K8 TERNATE +72 379
#note Missed the -T hook to SAVAGeS. (-10.7)
