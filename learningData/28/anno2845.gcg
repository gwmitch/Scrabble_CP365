>Jason: KMORTTU 9G MOT +20 57
#note O(A)KUM is one of the few goofy fives I know. I looked for plays through the A, just missed it. (-4.7)
>Joel_Horn: ENOP M2 PEON +17 65
>Jason: ABIKRTU K3 KAB +32 89
#note This or ABRU(P)T, which I didn't see. (-0.2)
>Joel_Horn: III -III +0 65
>Jason: EEEIRTU K8 .UREI +10 99
#note Stupidly passed on (L)EU ... scores one more and the leave's better. Dumb. (-8.3)
>Joel_Horn: DEIOSTZ 10C DOZIEST +85 150
>Jason: EEFNSTT L10 EFT +23 122
#note In hindsight, I like FET at N1 for offsetting biggies/an opener board with a NEST leave. Just couldn't bring myself to be that ballsy, even with Joel with a random rack. They sim close, with L12 FET just ahead, another gutsy play. (-0.3)
>Joel_Horn: EHIRT E10 .ITHER +36 186
>Jason: DEINQST -Q +0 122
#note Too fish-y. QI at N1 is suicidal (Q's clear pick, though), but at M9 it's fine, esp. given the current C-V ratio. (-21.5)
>Joel_Horn: LV 14D L.V +14 200
>Jason: DEINSTW N1 WIN +22 144
#note Again Q likes the ballsiness and says this is best.
>Joel_Horn: ?IILNNT N5 TINNILy +66 266
#note Nice find. Should've held, and maybe even challenged, since it was such a bad rack and maybe the game. But it's good. Joel wasn't sure.

#note Q likes SABI(R) at 15A. (-12.0)
>Joel_Horn: ?DQU 14K QUoD +35 355
>Jason: ACEIOST G12 OCA +15 218
#note I need to learn to play COATI for 32 or COATIS for 41 and give up the ghost. I get too stubborn sometimes. (-12.4)
>Joel_Horn: ALRR A11 R.RAL +15 370
>Jason: AEHISTX B14 XI +38 256
#note I knew, knew, KNEW this would happen, but it was still annoying as heck when Joel sighed loudly and threw up his arms. I fought the urge to say "Wanna check the total score again for me?" Lord knows what he would've done if I'd played TAXIS for 53 (4% win) or HAST for 50 (highest valuation). (-7.7)
>Joel_Horn: ERU 11A .UE +12 382
>Jason: AEGHOST G5 HA. +13 269
#note HOSE, HOST or HAST at 15L. (-47.8)
>Joel_Horn: AEGORSS 5D GOS. +16 398
#note Somewhere I forgot to track an I (XI?), so I'd mistracked and didn't have the time to fix it. Best.
>Jason: CEOOSTV 6B COOS +17 286
#note SCOT at 15G. (-10.0)
