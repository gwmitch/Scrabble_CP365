#note A dumb play, but hear me out. I played like a loo-loo vs. Lipe. I knowingly played like a loo-loo vs. Winter. I'm very, very tired. (In fact, when I see who I play, I think "OK, 11-9 is fine.") I know I probably need to bag him to win. What better way to create volatility? Saw the G- hook, the C- hook after I hit my clock, didn't know the D- hook. In hindsight, I play RUMpLES instead, 3.8 equity points behind the leader. Which isn't to say I'll always play RUMpLES against the Dackmans of the world. Didn't know/see Q's pick of MULLERS. (-10.4)
>Joe_Dackman: IJT F6 JI.T +27 27
#note And, like I said after REGROWTH vs. Jesse, I'd much rather try to beat super-experts at coin flips vs. Scrabble. I could tell Joe hated me. As soon as the clock was neutralized, he pointed to this play and said "Statistically ..." (shakes head) "Statistically, this just isn't worth the risk."
>Jason: ELOPRRY B6 LO.RY +18 90
#note Missing PYRROLE(S). (-63.0)
>Joe_Dackman: C 8A C....... +33 60
#note Yeah, I kind of dodged a bullet. He seemed to accept my "apology" in that I said I should've played RUMpLES.
>Jason: EELNPRT H4 PELT. +10 100
#note (I)NEPT, 7F. (-7.7)
>Joe_Dackman: X 7B .X +34 94
>Jason: ?EFGNNR I3 FEN +16 116
#note OK, luckbox, but I am winning the turnover battle 15-5. Now I start playing semi-decently.
>Joe_Dackman: EIINRV 4F VI..RINE +26 120
>Jason: ?DEGNRU K4 .NDUlGER +86 202
#note Only double-double. Took me a while to find, too.
>Joe_Dackman: EQY 7J Q.EY +20 140
>Jason: AAEGNOR 8M AGA +17 219
#note Missing (b)ARONAGE. (-37.5)
>Joe_Dackman: BEIMST A10 BEMIST +46 186
#note The way we're burning through consonants, vowel-itis is a distinct possibility for one or both of us.
>Jason: EHINORW 9M HOW +34 253
#note No-brainer board-closers make me happy. Q likes the J10 placement, but I'm already playing as much defense as possible. (-1.0)
>Joe_Dackman: AAAAAAA -AAAAAAA +0 186
>Jason: AAEIINR 3L ARIA +14 267
#note Missed INIA at B12. Bad defense! (-13.1)
>Joe_Dackman: IOOOOOO -IOOOOOO +0 186
#note Yes, that's two consecutive "pass seven"s if you're scoring at home. "If I can't win this game, put me in the Scrabble Hall of Shame now," I think.
>Jason: AEEINNT C10 EATEN +18 285
#note Now we're deliberately, as opposed to stupidly, giving up equity. Not playing TINEA, TENIA, ENTIA at 2J. Not opening up the board against Joe Dackman, not even after passing seven. No. No, no, no. (-11.8)
>Joe_Dackman: OORV D4 VROO. +30 216
>Jason: DDINOTU D11 DID +20 305
#note Passing on Q's pick of DU(A)D. DONUT does the job just as well, though. (-15.6)
>Joe_Dackman: EPZ 2J ZEP +39 255
>Jason: AFNOTTU J10 FOU +29 334
#note Leader in win %. The needlessly risky FOUNT leads in valuation. (-2.3)
>Joe_Dackman: EO E11 OE +15 270
>Jason: AABDNTT L10 DAB +22 356
#note Or DATA. (-3.4)
>Joe_Dackman: AHIO M12 OHIA +18 288
#note (Counted as 19.)

#note ANT, 6M. (-2.0)
>Joe_Dackman: CESU 10F SUE +19 341
#note Best.
>Jason: ALNO 10N AL +16 433
#note Joe asked me what my record was (after being "audited" for RUMbLES). I told him 12-8, and he gave an almost-sarcastic chuckle and threw the initial-ed winners' slip in my face. OK, that's an exaggeration, but he did flip it to me with a little too much vigor. But since he finished 11-13 (IIRC), I guess he had reason to be upset.
