>Jason: ??BRTUU 8B aRBUTUs +70 70
#note Jesse said this was the only game in the main event he was double-blanked. I remember playing Viebranz in Pontiac and him bingoing with AUTeURS. We co-annotated even though I bagged him, and we saw he could've played ARbUTUS. For whatever reason it stuck and as soon as I saw it, it went down. Hoping for the challenge.
>Jesse_Day: DFGINTU -  +0 0
#note JI: Which I got. After about 90 seconds, Jesse reminded me that I could courtesy draw ... I'd forgotten since I was so focused on staying still, not giving tells and sending telepathic waves to get him to challenge. Jesse also said this was the only challenge he lost all week.
#note JD: I was wrong. Adam challenged a play of mine off (sigh). I looked for a while and didn't see any of the other bingos in there, though there are actually a bunch, of which I might've seen TUBULAR and KRUBUTS. some other cool words in there: BURGOUT, BURNOUT/OUTBURN, UNBURNT and RUBOUTS. Ultimately, I decided that I just had to know if it was good or not. Great play by Jason again. Also, this was indeed the only time I was double-blanked in 24 games of main event.
>Jason: AENNRRX 7F AX +36 106
#note RE(T)AX or, surprisingly to me, EX. (-1.2)
>Jesse_Day: DFGINTU E7 F.NGI +31 31
#note TUFTING was my choice if I didn't challenged. just hoping for a lucky draw. could also do FUD at E7 or DIF at 6D, the last one is best according to quackle. FUNGI seemed the most opening of the plays.
>Jason: ENNRRVW 11D W.VERN +12 118
>Jesse_Day: DEINRTU C1 INTRUDE. +70 101
#note I'm not even sure I thought of UNTIRED or UNTRIED, but this actually is almost level with them for whatever reason.
>Jason: CEEHNRZ 1A CH.NE +33 151
#note Missed ZE(I)N. (-10.5)
>Jesse_Day: EIOQTVW F6 Q.. +32 133
#note have to decide whether to play this or WOVE first, and clearly chose wrong. I was worried about losing my Q spot, but that's very unlikely indeed and this allows better things to happen - specifically, WOVE gives QUOIT with a miracle draw. I was worried about the new spots I was opening as well, but there are already places to score, I guess.
>Jason: AEILRSZ H11 .AZER +45 196
#note Whiffed on (W)IZ. (-1.8)
>Jesse_Day: EIOTVWY 12A WOVE +38 171
#note hanging on for dear life
>Jason: ILOSSST 9C SO.S +33 229
#note JI: My favorite non-bingo from the 41 games.
#note JD: this jason guy is pretty good
>Jesse_Day: DHIIITY B10 HY.ID +40 211
#note JI: Dammit, Jesse, go away!
#note JD: again, trying to stay afloat with mediocre leaves.
>Jason: IJLMOST 14F JO. +26 255
#note In honor of the former No. 1 in Connecticut. :D (Although I seemed to be trying to keep him the current No. 1, given that I went 2-0 vs. Jesse.)
>Jesse_Day: ABIIOTT A12 .AIT +26 237
#note a mediocre play. I saw BRAZER but didn't realize it was good. probably a worse equity error than quackle thinks because it thinks I'll cash the spot next turn with the B. ugh.
>Jason: AAILMST 4A MA.TIALS +78 333
#note JI: I wasn't sure, but when Jesse didn't even hold, I figured it was good. It's not.
#note JD: wow. so much for dealing with phonies well. Saw ALARMIST as he played it and figured this was the anagram. ugh.
>Jesse_Day: BDIKOTT H1 KOB. +30 267
#note best play that doesn't use BRAZER, and fortunately at least competitive.
>Jason: AAEGLNP I1 APE +21 354
#note My turn to whiff on the front hook to RAZER. Surprisingly, this isn't too far back in sim; again, Q probably assumes I'll use it next turn. (-5.1)
>Jesse_Day: DEIILTT 13H .IT +13 280
#note I need something to go my way, fast, but this is still not that great. DITA or DUIT looked a little bit better. The D doesn't help that much, and the spot for the I won't make a huge difference.
>Jason: AEGLNNP 10H GAPE +31 385
#note Now I see it. GANE is better, though, despite sacrificing six points. (-4.2)
>Jesse_Day: DEEIILT B1 .I +14 294
#note JI: Jessse said he drew the S on this fish.
#note JD: yeah, Jessssse did. I couldn't figure out how else to give myself a chance without hitting something now, and none of the plays that burned through tiles looked all that great.
#note JI: Jessssssse needs to stop making fun of my typos. :)
>Jason: LMNNORR K6 RONN.L +12 397
#note I really liked what this did to the board. Q says I'm an over-defensive weenie. (-8.7)
>Jesse_Day: DEEILST 15H .ELISTED +80 374
#note still not even that close to jason, but this is start. I wasn't positive that this was good, actually. yikes.
>Jason: AADGMOR L10 DAM +23 420
#note The star valuation play is DO(N)G at 9I, setting up the -A hook. (-13.3)
>Jesse_Day: CEILOUY 8J U.COIL +33 407
#note JI: Jesse said he considered (N)OIL. This is a good play.
#note JD: I couldn't figure out any outbingos to hit. NOIL is the best setup play, but it's not that hard to block, and he can also probably ignore it and win. So this seemed best because it guarantees outs. Interestingly, quackle thinks YE at either of two spots is competitive, presumably because it leaves UNCOIL as the next play.
>Jason: AEEFGOR N10 FORAG. +36 456
>Jesse_Day: EOY M12 OY +25 432
#note slightly better than the outplay.
>Jason: EE O8 .EE +8 464
#note JI: Game of the tournament for me. I apologized to Jesse after the game because he was in second at the time, while even at 9-7 my odds of cashing seemed about as likely as a day trip to Mars. I hereby retract my apology, since Jesse finished second even without this game. :)
#note JD: Another really good game for jason. I made enough mistakes that I didn't deserve to win this one, and I'm glad that it was against Jason.
#note JI: Eh, draw the stuff I drew in those two games and half of Division 1 can look like Adam f***ing Logan.
>Jason:  (E) +2 466
