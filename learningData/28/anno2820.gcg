>Evans: BDEENSU 7J BEDU +12 28
#note I didn't know BEDUNCES. Did I even know BEDUINS? I feel like I should... -42
>Joe: ADEO 8A ODEA +22 35
#note It also plays at 10D. Quite cool.
>Evans: EFINOSX 6K FOX +30 58
>Joe: ADEIIPR 10G PERIDIA +69 104
>Evans: AEEIJNS M9 J.NES +40 98
#note I am awful with big points-leave dilemmas like this. I thought keeping AEI wasn't that bad because there were a wide-open D and S to bingo with, and it sims a little better because of that, but this is still really wrong. JADE B6 is 14 points ahead statically, and still way better after simming. -9
>Joe: MOOZ 11E ZOOM +42 146
>Evans: AAEFIRY 12D FAY +34 132
#note Of course I missed the FOXY hook. I saw AERIFY on my rack but never considered finding a spot to play it. That sucks. This is the best non-FOXY play, for whatever that's worth. -30
>Joe: ALWW 7A WAWL +35 181
>Evans: ?ACEIIR 12K AR.IC +20 152
#note This wins the sim. I like sticking a consonant in a good bingo lane here.
>Joe: INRU O8 RUNI. +21 202
>Evans: ?AEEIIL 13B LIE +11 163
#note I was correct that this is better than ILEA, which is shitty defense. I missed IDEA K9 though, which is an awesome fish. My play sims second-best. -3
>Joe: GHOT 14A GOTH +31 233
#note I wonder if he missed THO 6A?
>Evans: ?AEINSV E1 VAhINES +79 242
#note I should know SAVINES, hmm. SAVINES VINASSE. Good anagram pair. This word has sentimental value though. -12
>Joe: EEKMS 15D SMEEK +47 280
>Evans: ADEELOY N2 LEADY +59 301
#note Suuuuuuure, NOW I see it.
>Joe: INORRTU 2A URIN.TOR +70 350
#note This is an awesome stroke of good fortune for Joe. Given the pool, he's probably suspecting that I'm near a bingo, but this scores 70 AND sets up a potential Q play to get back in the game after I bingo. This is huge.
>Evans: ?AEGORS 1G GAROtES +83 384
>Joe: AHILNQT A1 Q.INT +45 395
#note LATH O1 is best. Even if I block his QUIN outplay, he still has QI at D4 for 46. Guaranteed win either way, though.
>Evans: NOTTTV 3K VOT. +14 398
#note I'm supposed to play TO 6B, blocking his best outplay of HADAL.
>Joe: AHL B6 H..AL +19 414
#note Wow. The best sequence NOW is to drop the L at 4D, blocking my TINT out, because he has three  huge HA spots (6B, 14F and the nifty 2J).
>Joe:  (NTT) +6 420
