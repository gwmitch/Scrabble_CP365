>Chris_Lipe: ??FGMSS -III +0 0
>Jason: DDHHNTV -DDHHV +0 0
#note Again, I make the wrong exchange. Q likes a DN keep. (-0.3)
>Chris_Lipe: ??EILSS 8C SImiLES +62 62
#note Seriously? (Personally, I liked SIckLES.)
>Jason: AALNOTW 9G ALOW +17 17
#note Close. AWOL on top of the LES. (-1.9)
>Chris_Lipe: AAEGINO C3 AGONI.E +20 82
#note See, this is a phenomenon Pete Zeigler and I talk about: 1800s foresight. Like when Peter Armstrong made an inferior bingo putting a R in a double-double alley and double-doubling with NONDAI(R)Y. 1800s foresight! Chris, 1798 coming into the tourney, just missed. Knowing he'd draw EGOMANIA - M, he made the blank an M ... but he must've forgotten about his setup. (Sorry for the ball-busting, Chris.)
>Jason: BINTUWZ B1 WIZ +41 58
#note Was late getting into the tournament room. I hate arriving early and stressing myself out, so I stayed in the hotel room for a bit. On ESPN: Air Force football. On ESPN2: Northwestern basketball. The triple option and the Princeton offense. Sweetness. I actually was a little late making it to the tourney room ... I hated tearing myself from the tube.
>Chris_Lipe: ACCDDDE 1A A.ED +30 112
>Jason: ABENPTU B5 BAP +21 79
#note (D)UP is cool, but I have to assume he has an E and I'll get whacked. Still, it's Q's clear pick. (-10.1)
>Chris_Lipe: CCDDINO D4 ODD +26 138
>Jason: BEENTUU E2 UNBE +32 111
#note Happy to see the cute UNBE, I missed the superior TUBE. (-1.6)
>Chris_Lipe: CCEIMNT D8 .NCITE +18 156
#note Whoa! (EL)ENCTIC!
>Jason: EEHSTUU F1 UH +26 137
>Chris_Lipe: CEGHMRR 13C M.RCH +32 188
#note "Bad Boy" fives Chris has played on me this tourney: 1. While parting with the E, MERCH/(INCITE)R would seem to be the play.
>Jason: AEEISTU 10J EAU +12 149
#note Q likes E(C)U by a bit. (-0.6)
>Chris_Lipe: EGOORTX 11I REX +44 232
>Jason: EINRSTV 14G INVERTS +67 216
#note Argh! I had umpteen bingos (including INVERTS at G11 for 82 and VENT(U)RIS for 74) before Chris' play, then he scores 44 and this is my only playable bingo. I had a feeling this just wasn't my game.
>Chris_Lipe: DGLNOOT 15D TONDO +34 266
#note "Bad Boy" fives Chris has played on me this tourney: 2.
>Jason: AIIKOOP 7E OKA +18 234
#note I don't like Q's pick of POI at 14A. But a close second is KOI(S) at M11, which I do like. (-7.0)
>Chris_Lipe: EGLORTV 6G GROVEL +23 289
>Jason: AFIIOPR L4 PI.AF +28 262
#note Best in valuation, but FI(R) at E11 has a better chance at winning, which I can see. Obviously Chris doesn't have the S; probably should play like I'll draw it because I don't see winning without it.
>Chris_Lipe: AELQSTU M3 QATS +43 332
>Jason: AFIORRT N2 FIR +28 290
#note That E11 spot comes up again (FOR or FIR), along with A(F)RIT at 8K, close in valuation to this with a superior win percentage. If I'd known AFRIT, I'd have played it.
>Chris_Lipe: EEILMNU O4 ELEMI +31 363
#note "Bad Boy" fives Chris has played on me this tourney: 3. Held and released.
>Jason: AEIORTY 12J RETIA +27 317
#note A certain stinkeroo nearly made an "I'm going to get assraped ... please use lube" comment before playing Chris in the late bird but instead just said after the game: "That was fun. You were firm yet tender. Thanks for practicing safe Scrabble." Uh ... ditto here, I guess.
>Chris_Lipe: GJNTUY M11 J.G. +24 387
>Jason: OY 14B OY +17 334
#note After his opening bingo, Chris just kept me at arm's length the whole game. Not much I could do.
>Jason:  (NTUY) +14 348
