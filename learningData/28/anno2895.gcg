>Winter: CEILPRU 8D PICUL +24 24
>Jason: EHIILMZ -  +0 0
#note Went with my gut and challenged. My gut was wrong. Plus, paranoid here thought he saw Winter going for the bag awfully quickly... (-38.4)
>Winter: EEEOOOR D8 .OOREE +16 40
#note Two turns, two red entries on the phony chart. Must. Review. Four-vowel. Sixes.
>Jason: EHIILMZ 9G HIM +26 26
>Winter: ?BEGNOS 10H BONGoES +72 112
>Jason: EILTUYZ K10 .LITZY +38 64
#note Missed ZL(o)TY. (-9.8)
>Winter: EGLNNRS 12J L.NG +10 122
>Jason: EEFISTU 14I FU.EES +40 104
#note (Scored as 42. Winter caught the mistake a few turns later.)
>Winter: EGNNQRS E7 Q. +11 133
>Jason: AAIJNTW C10 JAWAN +50 154
>Winter: EENNORS 15C SENORE +37 170
#note Up to three red entries on the phony chart. I did not like this, but S-less myself, he can play NOSE or ROSE for only six fewer, blah, blah, blah...
>Jason: DEIITUV 11B V..IED +20 174
#note Missed UVEITI(C). (-11.2)
>Winter: ABIKNTV E10 B.T +23 193
>Jason: ?CDIOTU 14E UDO +19 193
#note Missing OUTChID(E), OvIDUCT(S), COnDUIT(S) and nOCTUID(S). At least this sims roughly equal to the S bingos and I didn't know OUTCHIDE. (-11.7)
>Winter: AAIKNRV B13 KA +23 216
>Jason: ?CIIMRT 15M MIC +27 220
>Winter: AINNORV 13F ANI +12 228
>Jason: ?ADIRRT 14A R.. +3 223
#note I've forgotten to track JAWAN, so I have six A's out as opposed to four. I see that if I can draw an A, I can make a dramatic play. DARI(C) is Q's pick. (-7.1)
>Winter: ANOOPRV 11M NOR +9 237
>Jason: ?AADIRT F1 DRAmATI. +75 298
#note I told you I could make a dramatic play. Maybe missing DIAbETIC vs. Evans helped me be more alert to -IC bingos. And was that a "nice play" from Winter?
>Winter: AEOPRVX 12G OX +40 277
#note In the post-mortem, Winter said have shouldn't have played NOR, let me bingo, and kept the X for a column O play. Meanwhile, I was hoping he'd miss this spot.
>Jason: HIILOTW 1F .HOW +33 331
#note Missing WI(D)TH. (-21.1)
>Winter: AEEPRTV 3C REP.VE +30 307
>Jason: AGIILST I1 .IS +20 351
#note Q says (V)IGA is a guaranteed win. (-21.6)
>Winter: AAFTTUY E3 .AY +27 334
#note He took so long to make this play I did "rest my eyes" for a little bit.
>Jason: ADEGILT 2H L.GATED +29 380
#note Really wanted him to leave GL(A)DIATE open so the score would look like I knew what I was doing. D(I)GITAL, same spot. (-6.0)
>Winter: AEFTTU D1 FE.T +26 360
#note 1M plays don't give up a better out.
>Jason: I 1C I. +5 385
#note As Knappster would say: "Split blanks, split S's, split power tiles. A nice even draw!" (shakes head) What a stupid I am, but the tiles bailed me out.
>Jason:  (ATU) +6 391
