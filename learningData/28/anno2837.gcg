>Jason: BEHNRTW 7H BETH +31 31
>Winter: ADIINSU 9B INDUSIA +68 100
>Jason: ILNORSW 10H LOW +20 51
>Winter: AEILLOR D3 ARILLO.E +70 170
>Jason: INNORSU K10 NOUN +15 66
#note Q likes the 9K placement, which I considered. In hindsight, I agree. (HE)INOUS/(LOW)N woulda been sweet, too. (-4.1)
>Winter: AOZ C3 ZOA +50 220
>Jason: FIKNORS 12J F.NK +22 88
#note Lousy play. K(U)FI has a better leave, missed F(U)NK at E8, missed Q's pick of FO(E) at 10B. (-8.0)
>Winter: AACEFRS N6 CARAFES +88 308
#note Shades of my 585-330 loss to Winter in Rocky River in Feb. '08...
>Jason: EGIOPRS E3 PERI +37 125
#note Missed P(I)ROGIES and PORGIES. (-34.0)
>Winter: Q B8 Q. +11 319
>Jason: EGGIOSY O7 GEY +35 160
#note Clear valuation leader. GOYS at 11E is slightly better in wins, .20% to .15%.
>Winter: DOR M9 DOR. +27 346
#note I know I'm getting trounced, but there's no need to be insulting!
>Jason: GIOOOSW B5 WO +14 174
#note I knew I should've passed; I just couldn't stomach it. (-4.8)
>Winter: AEV 13I VE.A +18 364
#note (Scored as 19.)
>Jason: GIIIOOS 14L GOO +12 186
#note Now I really should've exchanged. Opening is a double-edged sword with both blanks out. Q likes keeping OS. (-17.4)
>Winter: ENY 15M YEN +25 389
>Jason: AEIIIMS -AIIM +0 186
#note AIS at F1 must give me a microscopic chance; despite its valuation being -11.5, it tops all the 0.00%s. Best in valuation.
>Winter: RT E8 R.T +7 396
>Jason: EEIILST E8 ...ILE +12 198
#note "Oh jeez," I think, seeing the 198 after this play. "Just let me get to 250." (My low in a tournament is 240, BTW, vs. Grob.)
>Winter: ??EHNRU F9 .H +27 423
#note Winter said he made a mistake here...only looked for words hooking the S to RUTILE. Missing UNHo(L)iER, but this is close, says Speedy.
>Jason: BCEIMST I5 IB.. +13 211
#note Missing C(L)IMB shows you where my brain was. Next to us, Evans was playing Lipe. Evans made a bag-emptying play, Chris checked the bag and Evans said "Yes, I've finished drawing the bag." (-27.8)
>Winter: ??ENRUV 12A ViRU.ENt +76 499
#note "Sorry," Winter said as he put this down, a la the 585-330 drubbing. "You can trash me in your blog." Evans laughed. "Ditto," he said to Chris. (Lipie and I each needed a hug after the game.)
>Jason: AEGJMST 14B JAMS +33 244
#note Wish I'd seen JETSAM, same spot. (-19.1)
>Winter: AIPTT H1 PITTA +26 525
>Jason: CEGMSTU J2 GEUM +16 260
#note Didn't know (T)ECTUMS. But I could've seen EMS at F1, eight better than this. (-11.0)
>Winter: DEI 3J .IDE +10 535
>Winter:  (CST) +10 545
