>Jason: AGRSTXY 8F GRAY +16 16
#note Didn't know STYRAX. Do want to learn the power tile sixes soon, though. (-17.0)
>John_Morse: FOOP 7H POOF +20 20
#note Bradley Robbins' dad asked to sit down beside the table (where he could see both of our racks and watch the game). Neither of us had a problem with that. He was reading a lot during the game and left before the end.
>Jason: AEILSTX 8K AXILE +65 81
#note Missed (F)LAXIEST. I hadn't played or studied any in 2-3 weeks to stay fresh for this marathon. As I played this, my hands were shaking badly. (-).

#note Only bingo.
>Jason: DEHIILT 8A HILT +31 181
>John_Morse: NRTUU A6 UN.URT +9 146
>Jason: DEEIIIN C10 .INE +14 195
#note Ducky likes (G)ENII, but I disagree. This is a very close second. (-0.1)
>John_Morse: AEGRT B2 GREAT +20 166
#note Those are his bad tiles?
>Jason: DEIIINP 4A P.IN +18 213
#note Missing (R)IPIENI. Didn't know this took the -ED; that is also superior. (-5.2)
>John_Morse: EH 10M EH +21 187
>Jason: BDEEIIZ 11K ZED +36 249
#note In "points, points, points" mode, I missed BEEDI and BIDE, same hook. (-15.2)
>John_Morse: EIRRSSV 13B R.VISERS +63 250
>Jason: ABEEFII H12 F.EE +33 282
#note Gah! Thought B(R)IE was bad. (-1.6)
>John_Morse: ENO D12 O.EN +20 270

>John_Morse: OT B12 O.T +9 279
#note Or at 3A for five more, but it blocks a bingo line.
>Jason: EIINNSW 13K SEWN +31 346
#note Q likes (E)ISWEIN at 14H by about one percentage point more, but this leads in valuation.
>John_Morse: AD A14 AD +11 290
>Jason: CDIILNO 3D ODIC +12 358
#note Tough call. Emptying on the number is always dangerous (as I'd prove in the late bird twice in a row). But the board would be almost dead for bingos after this, killing two of the three lanes and not giving him a chance to fish. OL(E)IC at 14F wins the most, 88.4%. OL(E)IN has a similar win percentage (81.9% to 82.4%) and the highest valuation. (-17.8)
>John_Morse: ACEILMT F2 M. +10 300
#note A WTF play.
>Jason: ?DIJLNU 1E JaIL +34 392
#note When I saw the J, I thought "Sh*t, that's supposed to stop him from bingoing!" Then I saw the blank and relaxed.
>John_Morse: ACEILT 14M EAT +15 315
#note Missing ATELIC as the out.
>Jason: DNU 15K DUN +11 403
#note Shaky start, but got the job done.
>Jason:  (CIL) +10 413
