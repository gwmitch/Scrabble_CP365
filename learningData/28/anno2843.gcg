>Karl_Higby: ?ADEEKM 8E MAKE +20 20
#note Karl spent a long time on this rack and wondered if he'd missed a bingo with this rack, but he didn't.
>Jason: EIINORU E3 IONIU. +16 16
#note Glad to see this. Close, but Q likes OURIE/(MAKE)R.
>Karl_Higby: ?DEEINN I2 INDENEs +69 89
>Jason: ADEGIRT 2H D.GERATI +78 94
#note Only bingo. Let's see who can draw better and hit the hot spots.
>Karl_Higby: ALOP 1L OPAL +36 125
>Jason: CELNTTY 3M YET +34 128
#note Ooh, (PA)TENCY or (PA)TENTLY! Nice. This is just decent. (-6.2)
>Karl_Higby: EGLU 1E LUGE +24 149
>Jason: AACLNPT D4 LAP +20 148
#note I wish I could say I was setting up ACT(A) at F5, but the truth is I only saw it later. Q likes PLAT a little better. (-1.2)
>Karl_Higby: ORU 4I .OUR +10 159
>Jason: AACCNOT F5 ACT. +30 178
>Karl_Higby: ADDR H5 DAR.D +14 173
>Jason: ACENOTW J4 .WE +20 198
#note Weird ... it seems like when I took a long time to make a play (like here) it was justified because there were no really good options and I made if not the best, one of the best plays. Like here, as Q approves.
>Karl_Higby: IR G8 .IR +12 185
>Jason: ACNOOTU 11D COUNT +22 220
#note Grateful to be able to turn over with ?SSSS out, but I played so fast I missed TOUCAN. I'm a little surprised this wins sim.
>Karl_Higby: EINRRT D9 RI.ER +14 199
#note He put down INERT at 12H, and while I work on not giving tells, I felt my eyebrow arch. "Holy cow," I thought. "SSS must all be in the bag." (I'd just drawn ?S.) Arch or not, he picked it up to do this.
>Jason: ?AJOOOS 14D SOJA +35 255
#note Turnover works, as I pluck three power tiles.
>Karl_Higby: ALNTX 15G LAX +32 231
>Jason: ?FGOOYZ 13G GOOFY +21 276
#note Q likes FOG(E)Y at 12A. In a minute, I'll wish I'd kept that O. The GOOFY-ness (wink, wink) is about to begin. (-6.5)
>Karl_Higby: AQT C8 QAT +18 249
>Jason: ?HSSVVZ K11 SH. +18 294
#note Karl asked what I left here, and when I told him he pause and said "OK, that makes sense." Missed V(AR)S/(IONIUM)S, which I'll see in time for the next turn. (-7.1)
>Karl_Higby: BEE J10 BEE. +22 271
>Jason: ?BSSVVZ 9B V..S +16 310
#note Dammit, if I'd played V(AR)S last turn, I wouldn't be hemorrhaging equity! Now that I see it, Q wants n(E)V(U)S at K1, which I never would've seen. Ve(R)B, another possibility I considered, leads in valuation. (-11.6)
>Karl_Higby: EN C5 NE +14 285
>Jason: ?BFSTVZ 3D F.Z +24 334
#note n(E)V(U)S again. (-20.9)
>Karl_Higby: EIIMNOW C12 WO +19 304
#note Best.
>Jason: ?BHISTV E13 B.T +10 344
#note Stupid nEVUS! I was proud of this play, too. (-15.0)
>Karl_Higby: EIIMN B11 ME +10 314
#note (R)IM is best by seven (and 27 better than this), blocks the out.
>Jason: ?HISV L7 sHIVS +17 361
#note While I would've liked vowels to go with the power tiles I hoarded, I can't complain. :) And since I can I-stick him, I should nickel-and-dime him. (-32.0)
>Jason:  (IIN) +6 367
