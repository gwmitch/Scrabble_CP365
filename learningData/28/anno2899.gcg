>Jason: ELRRTTZ 8G LEZ +24 24
#note Debated between this and exchanging into RET, but I remembered simming games with Evans post-EB talking about how Q hates throwing Z's back. Made the right call.
>Lloyd_Mills: IQ 9F QI +15 15
>Jason: EGNRRTT -GRT +0 24
#note Or keeping RET. A dead heat.
>Lloyd_Mills: DEINP 10E PINED +26 41
>Jason: EEIINRT E10 .IE +10 34
#note Correctly passing on NITERI(Z)E(D)*. Q likes just (P)I. (-5.3)
>Lloyd_Mills: EU I10 .UE +4 45
>Jason: AEFINRT H12 FAIR +42 76
#note Bunch of plays in this spot. FAIN has the slight edge; I'd just as soon do this. An N has been played, an R hasn't. (-2.4)
>Lloyd_Mills: INOW D12 WINO +26 71
>Jason: DEELNRT C11 DEL +18 94
#note No need to blow up the rack with L(A)TENED and leave this open, esp. how he's been fishing. (-0.8)
>Lloyd_Mills: EF 14B FE. +17 88
>Jason: EENRSTT D4 TENTERS +75 169
#note Or R(A)TTEENS or NETTERS. Near dead heat.

#note Missing SANGARE(E) for 22 more.

>Lloyd_Mills: AKOY 3G KAYO +45 194
>Jason: ?AHNOOW 5I HAO +28 286
#note Missing WAHOO, same spot. (-17.2)
>Lloyd_Mills: IJRV 8A JIV.R +45 239
>Jason: ?ANOOUW 2F WO +20 306
#note Two surprises: 1) That WOO instead leads in win percentage. 2) That WON instead leads in valuation. (-0.8)
>Lloyd_Mills: BMOUX 2J BUXOM +56 295
#note Normally, a play like this would be met with an internal "sonofab****!" But Sunday, I just told myself that he'd run out of big tiles to play and I had a slight lead on turn with the last blank. Go win the game.
>Jason: ?ACNOUU 3L UNAU +25 331
#note The only play. "Nice dump," Bradley Whitmarsh said looking at the board later.
>Lloyd_Mills: BY 7G BY +24 319
>Jason: ?CEGLOP 14F CL.P +18 349
#note Lousy play. A bunch of stuff better, including (WO)G. (-14.9)
>Lloyd_Mills: NOT J12 NOT. +23 342
>Jason: ?AEGHOR 1M HAG +32 381
#note Missing HAGROdE. G(ON)ORrHEA also plays, but it sims below this. (-13.2)
>Lloyd_Mills: ILM 6K MIL +10 352
>Jason: ?DEEORS O8 EnDORSE. +74 455
#note Oops. I had (U)RODElES the same as EnDORSE(e). (-2.6)
>Lloyd_Mills: DGIORST K9 GRIDS +24 376
