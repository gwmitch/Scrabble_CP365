>Sal: BIILN 8D BLINI +20 20
>Evans: ADNNOPS F6 PO.ND +18 18
#note I think I know DIPNOANS... NONPAID DIPNOAN sounds familiar. This is the best non-bingo. -36
>Sal: GORV H7 V.GOR +9 29
#note How strange.
>Evans: AAENOSY 11H .AYON +16 34
#note The sim likes RAYA better, which is interesting. Is ENOS a great leave on this board? I guess so. YEAN 9C is also a good option, which I flat-out missed. -4
>Sal: IMR J8 RIM. +15 44
>Evans: AEGHISU 7H .UG +19 53
#note This is sort of fishy -- maybe VAGUE is better. The real star play, though, is AGUISH 12D. Didn't know the word. -9
>Sal: EIQUU D7 U.IQUE +34 78
>Evans: AADEHIS 8J .ADISH +36 89
#note I set up that VUGH hook on purpose, and then I missed AAHED for 34. Stupid. -9
>Sal: ABCOR E2 CARBO +22 100
>Evans: AAERSTW L1 EASTWAR. +76 165
>Sal: DEJO 5J JO.ED +32 132
>Evans: AEIINOV 1H OVIN. +24 189
#note Quackle wants to play VOICE 2B, which indicates that Quackle doesn't care about the E sitting there in the freaking triple-triple lane, which indicates that Quackle is stupid. -3 my ass.
>Sal: FLOS 2J FO.LS +47 179
>Evans: AEILMNW C11 MAW +22 211
#note After FOALS, I can't really infer much about how good Sal's rack is. He may have just blown it up to score 47. So creating more bingo lanes seems to benefit me if I'm holding a leave like, say, EILN. I opened the EMU/AMU hook for a reason. I like this play. I saw Quackle's choice, 12K WAME, but passed it up. -1?
>Sal: OPTTY 12K POTTY +36 215
>Evans: ?AEGILN 14B ANGELIc +77 288
#note I spent FOREVER looking for a bingo in that B column -- something ending in -ETAL or-EGAL that would score boatloads. Turns out there's nothing. ANGELIC is great defensively and sims best.
>Sal: EKZ B10 ZEK +48 263
#note Too bad I couldn't use that spot, huh?
>Evans: ?AEEFLU 4A FUnE.EAL +80 368
#note The only bingo.
>Sal: CDER O11 C.DER +33 296
>Evans: EEEHTTX 13E HEX +45 413
#note I thought about THEFT A1, but instead I spent a few minutes making sure there were no possible triple-triples in the pool. There were not. So I took the points and played HEX, figuring I couldn't possibly lose. Quackle still wants to play THEFT, and I usually trust CP in situations like this... maybe HEX is wrong? Not sure.
>Sal: AEINRST A4 .AINT +24 320
#note GAINST 9H would have been sick.
