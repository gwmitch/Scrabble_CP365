#note Dammit, Bradley, didn't you know you were supposed to give me the G so I could play DIGERATI for the second time vs. my opponents' once? I'd have taken the N, too.
>Jason: ADEIIRT G9 AI +9 9
#note Q likes ditching the I. (-4.2)
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: DEHOP F10 HOPED +36 62
#note What happens a Cheesecake Factory stays at Cheesecake Factory, but I had to share this best example of Bradley's wit, a la Rod's LJ post. We're waiting for our table and sharing records. Bradley was 7-5. "You might cash," Terry said. "If Evans can be 9-3..." Bradley said.
>Jason: DEIIORT 12D DO.IER +20 29
#note I'm done with fishing and decide to turn over. This would prove about as good an idea as playing the late bird. Q likes TRIODE at I4. (-5.1)

#note Stupid! VERIT(E) leaves XI! (-33.0)

>Jason: EIRTX 10M XI +30 282
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: IN J13 IN. +5 450
