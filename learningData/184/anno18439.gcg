#note I wasn't a big fan of playing this, since it leaves me with nothing on this board, but hopefully Zev's play gives me back something.

>Jackson_Smylie: DLOPQUZ F12 DOZ. +34 207
#note In a realllly good position now, one high scoring Q play and the game is essentially over.
>Zev_Kaufman: IPU A13 PIU +22 110
>Jackson_Smylie: CLNOPQU K11 CLON. +14 221
#note I wasn't sure enough of CLOQUE to play it, it's much better than my play. I was likely playing too scaredly this turn, but if I can get through another turn without him bingoing, the board could be really dead thanks to CLONE.  It also sets up a potential Q play.
>Zev_Kaufman: EW 10D .EW +29 139
>Jackson_Smylie: EIPQTUX 12H QUI.T +48 269
#note At the time I simply played QUILT since it didn't put the T out there as a bingo lane, but QUOIT leaves G13 open, which is a nice spot for my X.

#note CHUGGIN is in the bag, which would most likely win if he plays it, I have to block.
