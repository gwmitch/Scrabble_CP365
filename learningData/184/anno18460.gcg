>Josh: ABFIOSU H7 FOU +12 12
#note Quackle actually likes playing FUB here over my play. It's interesting, and I see its merit. So maybe -1?
>Bruce_Ward: ELMO 10F MOLE +19 19
>Josh: ABDDISS 11E BIDS +29 41
#note I wondered if MOLEY* or MOLED* were good but I thought better of them. This looks right though. ADS is probably a bit better than IDS.
>Bruce_Ward: EVX 12D VEX +42 61
>Josh: ADNQRST 13F TRANQ +29 70
>Bruce_Ward: ?EILRTT K7 TILTERs +76 137
>Josh: ?ADEERS L2 REsEDAS +71 141
#note Damn, this turn I had missed (MOLE)S(T). REDAtES J4 is the play. This is almost a 10-point error.
>Bruce_Ward: AGP I6 GAP +17 154
>Josh: DEEMRST M5 DERM +23 164
#note Add that to a bingo I didn't know that I had, DEEMSTER, then you have around 50 points of error thus far. This is still not that good of a play. 
>Bruce_Ward: AIL K3 AIL +17 171
>Josh: BEIOOST N6 BESOT +37 201
#note I think I should play just BO here. I considered it very shortly and dismissed it too quickly. BOS also looked alright but this does too. I wanted to give Bruce a headache here
>Bruce_Ward: ITU 10K .UT.I +5 176
>Josh: CILNNOO 12K .OLIC +20 221
>Josh: CILNNOO --  -20 201
>Bruce_Ward: APY 2K P.AY +24 200
#note I didn't notice S(PAIL) here, probably cause it didn't make sense for him to set it up
>Josh: CILNNOO 1M NOO +16 217
#note I was pretty sure INIONS was valid so I didn't go with INION here. This was really the same deal as last turn save knowing not to play ROLIC*. I was scared he had the Z and I avoided it for one turn, but I really had no choice here besides going crazy and playing CON(VEX). 
>Bruce_Ward: DINY 12K .INDY +26 226
>Josh: CHIJLNS N12 .JIN +24 241
#note First turn when I missed SPAIL. This was an insane move by me. 
>Bruce_Ward: GORW 15K WRO.G +30 256
>Josh: CEEHILS 8G C.. +7 248
#note SPAIL.
>Bruce_Ward: HN 3J H..N +20 276
>Josh: EFHILRS H13 .HI +18 266
>Bruce_Ward: EE D12 .EE +6 282
>Josh: EFKLRSV 14B KE.F +22 288
#note this sucks. I chickened out of KEV(I)L
>Bruce_Ward: EINRT 15A NITRE +39 321
>Josh: AACELSV 15G A. +2 290
#note (H)A/(N)A at 14H was the first thing I considered but it didn't block Z(I)G. I wanted to win at least every time he had the Z, which is 5/8 at the least. I didn't play V(I)A cause the V is actually very useful unless I draw the Z. 
>Bruce_Ward: W 13C W. +22 343
#note Bruce actually drew the Z after this play. Not to be results-oriented, but it seems like he should pass in just about every scenario, whether he has the Z or not. He's in the lead. 
>Josh: U M10 .U. +3 293
#note Not a good draw. This only wins 25% of the time, if I draw the O, unless Bruce messes up. (I)V(Y) O10 wins only if I draw another U. Which means that Z sticking was only viable if Bruce didn't have the W to score. 
>Bruce_Ward: AAGIOUZ 4I GA.. +9 352
>Bruce_Ward: AAGIOUZ --  -9 343
#note He took all of his remaining time obviously and then just played this, thinking that the blank S was something else.
>Josh: ACELOSV 1E ALCOVES +93 386
#note The luck of the lucky
>Josh:  (AAGIOUZ) +34 420
