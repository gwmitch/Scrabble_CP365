>Jackson_Smylie: EHLLOTT H1 HOLT. +27 87
#note It's between HOLTS and TETHS. I like grabbing points, but LLO is really dreadful. The board isn't great for bingoing, but ELT will give me a much better chance. Quackle puts HOLTS a bit above TETHS.

>Jackson_Smylie: GIIINOT 4K OI +7 173
#note Tough decision here, no option is good for me. I liked OI better up top since it didn't block the 13 lane, but I realize EL doesn't take many hooks, and the ones it takes aren't currently on my rack. blocking the 3 lane partially isn't a good idea. Everythign sims pretty close togeether.

>Jackson_Smylie: EGIINTY 10A I.Y +8 181
#note I need to catch a lucky break or two to win this game. I really wanted to score some points so that a potential bingo would get me back in the game. EYING 12K is good.

#note 9H MU(L)BERRy is one of the best plays ever. I didn't see any bingoes through the G (there aren't any), but I saw RAISO(N)NE fit, and that is more likely than average to be on his rack, since AENORS, AEINRS, and EINORS are very reasonable leaves he may have kept.

#note I wasn't sure enough of sIMAR to play it. I was completely shocked to have won this game, I had to catch many a break to do so.
