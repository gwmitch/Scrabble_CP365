#note I think pressing the button on the clock is some sort of mental trigger for me. Or rather the sound is.  I often find the best plays right after hitting my clock.  Scott took a very long time on GALA and the only bingo I saw the whole time was DECAPOD.  I looked through the R and I and didn't see anything.  When he laid down the G at A6, I'm thinking "Good, DECAPOD won't be blocked. " Yet as soon as he hits his clock, I play PRODUCED.

#note Missed DEV for 26.  I wanted to play 10G BEEF, but decided not to do so for whatever reason.

#note I forgot to write my rack down.  I know I had BRY.  I had the B last turn and I remember thinking of GRAPEY.
>Scott_Garner: IQS J6 QIS +39 247
>Tasha: ?BENRYZ C2 BREeZY +58 300
#note I thought this play was interesting.  The very first thing I considered was VERY, but I rightfuly decided that was stupid.  Then I thought of BEVY instead.  BEVY is little bit better but I eventually see BREEZY.  Then just BY instead.  The deciding factor for BREEZY over BY was the fact that Scott used the case S to play QIS, killing column J.  Because all the Ss are gone and I have the last blank, I felt that it was to my advantage to burn the blank for 58, especially since he's catching up.  The tempo and board will also be under my control.  If Scott doesn't bingo in the next two turns, I should win this game.
>Scott_Garner: EITU K3 ETUI +19 266
>Tasha: AEEHNOX D3 EX +38 338
#note I almost played M9 HEAVEN (sets up OX), but I felt that playing HEAVEN was counter-productive.  If I'm going to play HEAVEN, then I should have played BY last turn.  See I'm going for board control.  I also didn't like the idea of giving up both Es.  So I played EX.  L2 EXON accomplishes the same thing and is better.  I missed it.
>Scott_Garner: IIT 6C .ITI +15 281
>Tasha: AEHKNOR L3 NOH +23 361
#note The only plays I considered were THANK (dismissed quickly) and L1 KENO (strongly considered).  I played NOH over KENO because it's easier for me to control the board that way.  
>Scott_Garner: ADIM B1 MAID +36 317
>Tasha: AAEJKRT M10 JA.A +28 389
#note I was very close to playing A1 ART, but once I realized RAB* isn't good, I considered just AT.  I simply didn't want to have to deal with the J in pre-endgame so I played JAVA instead of blocking column A.  I know I'm about to get burned for ignoring the spot, but at least I'm aware.
>Scott_Garner: LOW A1 OWL +42 359
>Tasha: CEKOORT 3J K..T +16 405
#note Woohoo, I got it right.  I mean, KENT is not the BEST play (well it is if using Championship Player), but it's still strong.  I took a very long time here mainly just eliminating plays on column N.  I missed KENO, but I'll be honest here.  I was under the impression that KENT takes an O (the good news is that I was chickening out while Scott was taking his turn) and I'm setting up COOKER on column N.
