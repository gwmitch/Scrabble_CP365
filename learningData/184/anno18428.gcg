#note I'm definitely capable of finding ELATERITE for the 2x2, just wasn't quite on my A game.
>Siri: ETW 8M .EW +18 66
>JD: AAFNNOV L1 FANO +26 163
#note if I want to be defensive on this move I can play NOVA at 10E  to block, or I can also just play FANE at L3 - but I'm fine with playing for equity here
>Siri: DEL 1L .LED +24 90
>JD: AENPTUV 10E UVEA +23 186
#note quackle suggests that UVEA does not decrease his bingo percentage that much, but it definitely forces him to find harder bingos.

>Siri: GH E9 H.G +14 122
>JD: GINPQTY K9 .YING +18 240
#note a complicated move - I would like to block and also further my chances of playing off the Q. quackle suggests just dumping the Q now, which seems reasonable since I can respond more flexibly if he bingos. this play doesn't really block much anyway.

#note my position has steadily gotten worse, but all I need is a vowel to cash the J.

#note I ran out of time here and blew the pre-endgame - he has one possiblye bingo, EMBODIER, which I should block with SI at 10M.

#note he has embrued for 40
>JD: AIIRSST A10 SITARS +23 378
#note best is TIES at 2F to block BREDE and save ARILS out
