#note just take it one turn at a time basically here; it's very important to try to catch up asap.

#note it's still early, but my chances don't look very good at all.

#note 9G PE actually makes a huge amount of sense here. play it short and try to bingo asap. PE gives me the best bingo chances next turn. taking the R scoring spot is not as important as bingoing as soon as possible. even though this is a mistake, it only results in me winning 1% more often, so i wonder if i should only beat myself up 1% harder.
