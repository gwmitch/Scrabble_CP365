#note I looked for at least 5 minutes and couldn't find a bingo here. There wasn't one, but perhaps I should have phoneyed. I felt the need to maximize my bingo chances next turn, which this play effectively does. But in terms of average score, a play like 10E AI averages about the same as A(W), since it scores 7 more. I think this play is necessary at this point though, since I'm already at less than 20% to win against a perfect opponent, so maybe something like 40% against Roland.
>Roland_Fillio: EX 12C EX +36 156
>Josh: AEILRST 13H SALTIER +81 125
#note So now I'm at a bit more than 20% to win. In terms of optimal strategy, I've been making good plays so far, but I could maybe have done more so far in terms of exploitative strategy. So far I've only made an even better play than the best valid play twice.
>Roland_Fillio: ?GLNPTT M3 PLoTT.NG +74 230
>Josh: BHORSTT B10 THROB +34 159
#note This looks right, although BORSHT in the same spot scores 10 more. I think the S is worth more than ten points here, for hooking THROB and also for bingoing. The board after BORSHT also looks conducive to a comeback, but the comeback seems more based on luck than on anything else. I still feel like I can win this game if I outplay Roland. B11 THROB is also interesting. My play is more standard, I guess.

#note And yet I forget probability 2017, so I no longer have anything to complain about
>Roland_Fillio: ADEIRU A6 UREDIA +28 276
>Josh: CDOOSST O1 COD. +21 180
#note And to follow up I make a pretty bad play here. J11 SO(L)D looks right as Roland might not know SOLDI and SOLDO and might not challenge SOLDS. Maybe J8 (R)ODS so I don't have to worry about that factor, or just COD(E)S or COO(E)D.
>Roland_Fillio: DDEEILN 5F ELIDED +26 302
#note He first put down DENILTED*, probably confused with DENTILED, and then this. It would seem J6 DI(R)LED is the play here.
>Josh: JLOOSST N2 JO. +44 224
#note Interesting choice between JO(E) and JO(E)S here. I didn't want to inform Roland that I had an S, so I felt that overrode the slight leave value difference I perceived between SLOTS and LOTS as well as the point difference between the two.
>Roland_Fillio: AYY A13 YAY +36 338
#note But it didn't matter I guess. JO(E)S it is.
>Josh: LOPSSTV H1 VOLT. +27 251
#note Perhaps I should add the S even though it's phony. Or perhaps I should play L11 SP(I)V. I think the latter is better, but not by much, since I'm still down if I bingo post-SP(I)V, so scoring is at a premium.
>Roland_Fillio: INZ F2 ZIN. +33 371
>Josh: EEFMOSS 4A FOEME. +30 281
#note Yet again I miss a better play, J11 SE(L)F. FOEME(N) was basically throwing in the towel if I was playing someone better than Roland.
>Roland_Fillio: EGINNU C3 G.NUINE +20 391
>Josh: ?PQRSSU L11 QU.P +30 311
#note Here I think I have to hope for the U. It would seem difficult for me to lose if I draw the last hook for QUIP, (QUIP)U.
>Roland_Fillio: AUV 15J VAU +24 415
#note I tried to get him to chicken out of QUIPU with a very confused look on my face...
>Josh: ?AORRSS 1F AR.OS +22 333
#note -6 but -3 in reality. AR(V)O gives me (U)S(U)RpS 6A, which I missed.
>Roland_Fillio: AHIMO 10D HAO +30 445
