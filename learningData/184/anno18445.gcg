>Matt_Canik: ?ACDIIN H7 CoNIDIA +70 70
#note INDICIA is good since it puts another I out. Matt played CoNIDIA since I might not know the hooks to it (I prove very quickly that his logic was sound!)
>Jackson_Smylie: EINNOTT 13H .NOINT +14 14
#note I saw CoNIDIAN, but talked myself out of it. Also missed INTON(A)TE!
>Matt_Canik: EILORTZ J10 TRO.Z +36 106
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIPRRT 8G P.RTIERE +60 74
#note PRETERI(T)
>Matt_Canik: ADEEILO 7K ODEA +16 122
>Jackson_Smylie: ADLNSUU O8 SULU +42 116
#note Didn't know SULDAN. 
>Matt_Canik: EEIILNU 11F UN.E.LIE +18 140
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ADLMNT 10D DAM +22 138
#note I was somewhat worried about an X bomb, and DAM looks good anyways.
>Matt_Canik: HIORSVY 14M IVY +20 160
#note SHIV(ER)Y for 40!
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ALMNTY D8 MA.LY +28 166
>Matt_Canik: AHLOORS C7 OOH +24 184
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEJNNT L10 J.N. +22 188
#note I saw JENNETs but once again was not sure of the word. Quite the game for bingo misses on my end! ENJ(OI)N is really nice, offering another bingo lane.
>Matt_Canik: ALORRSW B8 RAW +25 209
#note RAW is really dangerous with two F's and a P out, ARROWS is another option but it too takes hooks (but they aren't as scary since they wouldn't score asmuch, and fewer words have BFHMNY as a second letter. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEFKNT A6 KEF +57 245
>Matt_Canik: GLORSST E4 TROGS +22 231
#note FROMS*. I didn't feel like I was in a position to challenge, especially since I was about 50/50 on FROMS.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?CEGNRT 6D C.G +10 255
#note No great lanes available, but I'm sure I will get a bingo down soon enough. Blocks the X bomb as well.
>Matt_Canik: ALOOPSV C12 AVO +17 248
#note I feel like COG really implies I'm holdling well. I could be working through consonants, but still it's very likely I would score so little. Either I'd exchange if my rack was terrible, or I would try to score as much as possible. AVO is gutsy. 

OVA in the same spot is sweet, setting up the L. It's moot because of lINTERS in this case.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EINRST 15C SINTERs +78 333
#note Not a bad draw
>Matt_Canik: DEHLOPS 6K POSH +43 291
#note I think HYP gives matt the best chance of winning. POSH could really only win if I play suboptimally (not blocking the T in trogs). 
>Jackson_Smylie: ABBEIIX O13 B.E +24 357
#note I want to score decently and save points. ABIIX is a decent scoring leave here, and the pool is so bad for bingoes I'm not worried about blocking the T.
