>Matt_Canik: ?ACDIIN H7 CoNIDIA +70 70
#note I know the hooks to CONIDIA and I don't think he'd be certain on them. I played it here because this placement leads to a closed board a lot, I think. 
>Jackson_Smylie: EINNOTT 13H .NOINT +14 14
#note Jackson misses the CONIDIAN hook for TONTINE and INTON(A)TE. 
>Matt_Canik: EILORTZ J10 TRO.Z +36 106
#note (D)OZIER may lead to the board I want more often, but this is definitely the higher equity play. Thoughts?
>Jackson_Smylie: EEIPRRT 8G P.RTIERE +60 74
#note Damn that hook
>Matt_Canik: ADEEILO 7K ODEA +16 122
#note Want to obstruct the S hook he's eying
>Jackson_Smylie: ADLNSUU O8 SULU +42 116
#note SULDAN is a cool word
>Matt_Canik: EEIILNU 11F UN.E.LIE +18 140
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ADLMNT 10D DAM +22 138
>Matt_Canik: HIORSVY 14M IVY +20 160
#note I talked myself out of SHIV(ER)Y for 40... 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ALMNTY D8 MA.LY +28 166
>Matt_Canik: AHLOORS C7 OOH +24 184
#note Don't want to set up THAE, like setting up the S on OMS. Jackson isn't playing very fishily right now and I'm holding well so I don't mind opning bingo stuff. Maybe I play HOL(M)?
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEJNNT L10 J.N. +22 188
#note JENNETS is 86
>Matt_Canik: ALORRSW B8 RAW +25 209
#note I'm setting up the front F hook, which is sort of risky. But I'm also setting up OMS while blocking everything else and holding about as well as I can while scoring reasonably. Sim says I overthought and should just play WO 6N. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EEFKNT A6 KEF +57 245
>Matt_Canik: GLORSST E4 TROGS +22 231
#note Was about 30-40% this was a word (it's not) but I NEED it to be, I'm in horrible shape. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?CEGNRT 6D C.G +10 255
>Matt_Canik: ALOOPSV C12 AVO +17 248
#note I didn't think COG was a fish because it didn't really make sense to fish on this board. I thought he was working through junky consonants. I didn't think he was holding ENRT?. OVA makes just as much sense and sets up an L- I have the last one. As it turns out he'd just play Linters there though. OVAL/CONIDIAL gets me burned at 15A a lot but maybe I need to try that. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EINRST 15C SINTERs +78 333
#note good game
>Matt_Canik: DEHLOPS 6K POSH +43 291
#note H(Y)P is a good play I didn't see- scores 33 and holds DOLES. But jackson is always blocking that T next turn. I'd have to pull a 9 through the (ER) in the M column. I'm just hoping Jackson locks down and scores very little and I can catch up. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ABBEIIX O13 B.E +24 357
#note Pool looks so bad for bingos that jackson doesn't really need to worry.
