>Jackson_Smylie: DEIMOTU H8 ODIUM +22 22
#note ODIUM surely has the best equity here, and there's a chance Steve misses podium and sodium, and may not know odium takes an S. I think this is my first time opening vertically ever.
>Steve_Ozorio: EGIORSV 11B GREVIO.S +74 74
>Steve_Ozorio: EGIORSV --  -74 0
>Jackson_Smylie: EEHNNOT G11 NOH +16 38
#note Many options here - NONHE(M)E is a cool word I didn't know. NEON G8 leave him with very few options. HEN I11 looks good, although it creates a lane below that I don't want to worry about. I can't trust the sim, since when I specify his rack, it has Steve making the best equity play. 
>Steve_Ozorio: EGIORSV 11F G.. +4 4
>Jackson_Smylie: CEELNPT 7E CLEPT +22 60
#note PLENC(H) is a cool word. I know he is holding EIORSV, so I like blocking SODIUM, and maybe baiting him into playing CLEPTS or NOHS? I don't think it's likely he'd play those, though.

#note BX will score a lot next turn, it's a good leave. This is a perfect rack to have on this board.

#note Steve misdesignated the blank. sorry :(

>Jackson_Smylie: AANRSTY --  -81 305
#note This was a very ridiculous play, there is absolutely no reason to phoney here. My thought process at the time was that Steve might think if he challenges and it's good, I could block toreutic next turn and surely win, so he would just take toreutic now. But in reality he knows NOH doesn't take an S. This is a really unnecessary risk to take, when I can play AY(E)S F1, block his best bingo, and still be in the lead if he bingoes again. Sometimes I need to take a step back from the game board and not be greedy, and not let any frustrations with a no-go affect the play I make.
>Steve_Ozorio: ?EIORTT 1A TOREuTI. +80 258
>Jackson_Smylie: AANRSTY 2A AY +22 327
#note F11 (G)RAY is a nice play, since there is just one more S in the pool.

#note When I played JADES, I noted the possibility of BANJO in my head, and of course miss it when it comes up!

#note I'm going to draw VY, so FINDING sets up T(I)VY, and leaves IVY 10H.
