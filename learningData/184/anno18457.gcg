#note Orry held my last play. I thought he was holding TERRINE but he was actually unsure of AGONE, since he knew that AGONES was the plural of AGON.

#note In return I hold DIPROTIC.

#note I was pretty unhappy after drawing what I drew here. I didn't think that the total of the mistakes that I made this game made up for him having played COOTY*. 
I mean do I really keep UU and play for 28 points here? Or do I play 15B GUID? The pool sucks, and I'm down. I knew I was in a bad position.

#note The 4 I miss the most though, is ONYX. And that play would have been very important to see here. I wanted to keep S(I)X for next turn and 
block the most dangerous spot, but this is something like a 15 to 20-point mistake. Still doesn't really account for the 40+-point mistake that was COOTY* though

#note There's really nothing to play here that wins more than once in a millenium. It was really frustrating to be me here, but I had no idea ONYX was my fatal error.
