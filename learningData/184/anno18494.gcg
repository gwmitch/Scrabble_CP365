#note Wow, YOWED is a word?  How come I didn't know this?  Even after seeing every five several times?

#note My scribbling was too unclear for me to see what the fourth letter I exchanged was between the BCG and Q.  I'm hoping it was an L, but I'm fearing that it was an O.

#note Not smart.  Glad he didn't have a bingo with the S he played on the next turn.  CWM is hard to see, but obviously a billion times superior.

#note I almost played SARGEANT here (shudder) thinking it was a valid spelling.  I was pretty sure there was something here.  Horrific whiff especially since he bingoed the next turn.  I'm certainly well familiar with TANAGER.

Also, did I really think I'd likely bingo with only one consonant on the next turn?  I needed to at LEAST play GAB obviously given that bizarre miss...

#note Okay, so despite my error, I DID bingo with only one consonant.  Luckbox.

>Sean_Wrona: CEIIORS 4G OI +19 249
#note ISOMERIC, however, is a pretty forgivable miss.  I have not studied that before and while I wouldn't challenge it, it's not something most intermediates would be likely to find - maybe even most experts.

#note I don't know what my leftover tiles were and this is an important turn to know what they were to see if I had any chance of winning, but I don't really believe that I did...
