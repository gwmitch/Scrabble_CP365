#note I was happy to see that Y.
>Jackson_Smylie: ?CIJOST 10G JO.STICk +71 83
#note Missed JOCOSITY for 16 more. There was a prize for lowest probability word, and JOYSTICk had a pretty great shot at winning that, but Lloyd opened with MACCHIA in his last game!
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: AFO 11J OAF +23 57
>Jackson_Smylie: AACINTW F6 CAW +26 109
#note I was pretty close to playing ACT(I)NIA. I want to have a lot of turnover since the JOYSTICk S hook will be huge. I didn't like the hooks ACTINIA opened, and I liked the equity of CAW  bit better. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: EINX 4H .IXEN +30 87
>Jackson_Smylie: AAGINST O5 AGAINST +94 203
#note Not sure if the 6 point sacrifice is worth it to not open up the N2 spot. 3I is already big, and will be taken very often, but with a Z, K, and Y out (other tiles too, but those are most worrisome), I didn't want to worry about that spot. Quackle puts ANTISAG up, I think in hindsight I agree.
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?EFGRSY 3I KORAE +52 139
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ?EFGRSY --  -52 87
>Jackson_Smylie: BDEHLOR 3I BEHOLD +53 256
#note Sets up KEX, and he has an O, but without a second O (he would have played KAROO probably if he had OO) the spot isn't very dangerous, and if he hits it I will likely get points on the triple. The next best play there is BORED, which sets up points as well.

>Jackson_Smylie: BDENNRS 12H BENDS +41 315
#note It would be nice to hold onto the case S, but it's not worth much on this board anyways, and BENDS pretty much seals the game.

#note Just trying to run away with points.

#note Talked myself out of GLUTE, thinking GLUTES was possibly sticky S.
