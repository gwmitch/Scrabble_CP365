>Matt: EEINRRS 8C RERISEN +66 66
#note I think this is the best play
>Joey: ELLNSTY F7 T.NSELLY +71 71
>Matt: DEIOPRT H1 PROTEID. +86 152
>Joey: AJY G3 JAY +45 116
#note He scored this at 47 and I corrected it during the endgame. This becomes extremely important.
>Matt: EIILOOT 7D OO.I. +14 166
#note Not a lot of good choices here, but this looks best. Do you agree?
>Joey: ADEILOT 1H .ETALOID +86 202
>Matt: EEILMTU 12D MU.E +12 178
#note I missed EMU
>Joey: FI 2M IF +22 224
>Matt: EFILOTU 3J FOUL +20 198
>Joey: HISV H12 SHIV +41 265
>Matt: AEHINRT L3 .H +10 208
#note Q says HUE. I see what it means, but at this point it's bingo or bust, and I don't want to get screwed for a few turns with TRAIN
>Joey: ADOW 10B WOAD. +17 282
>Matt: AEINRRT 15H .ERATRIN +86 294
#note Phew
>Joey: ABEK 14K BEAK +40 322
>Matt: ?ABCIMT 13J IAMB +36 330
#note Best by far, and the only thing to consider
>Joey: AUX J3 .AUX +30 352
>Matt: ?CDTUVW -DTUVW +0 330
#note I probably should have played WUD here, but I figured I'd probably need a bingo. I don't think that this is as big of an error as Quackle says, however.
>Joey: GGI K6 IGG +14 366
>Matt: ?OOPQTZ 14B ZOOT. +34 364
#note I hated doing this, but it's probably about 50 50 that he has an A and I have to try to catch up and stay positive. Q concurs that this is best, but nothing's over 50%
>Joey: AVW 15A VAW +43 409
#note Damn it
>Matt: ?ACENPQ 4D QAN.. +28 392
#note Only choice.
>Joey: ?CDENTU C13 C.. +16 425
>Matt: ?CEGNNP K5 P...iNG +52 444
#note This wins 50%, everything else wins very infrequently
>Joey: ?DEESTU 5B DUiT +22 447
#note TiE, DiE, and DUi all on the Q win. Joey thought, however, that DUiT would win, because he still had JAY overscored in his mind.
>Matt: CEENR B1 CREE. +16 460
#note CREED/CERED are the only ways to win
>Joey: EES I7 S.EE +14 461
>Joey: EES --  -14 447
>Matt: N 11F .N +4 464
#note What a game to put me at 6-1
>Matt:  (EES) +6 470
