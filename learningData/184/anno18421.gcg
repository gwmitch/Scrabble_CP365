#note telegraphing an A here with an excellent rack. i somehow did not think of DAUB, partly because i liked putting the B there so didn't think much further on it -- but if he has an A already, it doesn't matter! lol. (-4)

#note a lot of interesting fishes. i liked 12D USE but i really was uneasy about the Z or X possibility catching him up right away. 12D USE sims best, but it's not terribly far ahead. (-3)

#note this spot can wait. taking the T is more important. quackle likes DONUT, but DAUNT's gotta be better keeping the A, right? quackle also prefers NOSE to DOSE but not too many spots to bingo really. (-7)
