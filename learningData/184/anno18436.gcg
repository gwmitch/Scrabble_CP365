>Avery: CEMOPSU H7 CUM +14 14
#note even between playing long with COUPE and CUP/CUM. CUM is easier to overlap, but EOPS evidently outbingos EMOS
>JD: EEEFGLN 9F FE.E +11 11
#note seemed to leave the most useful possible leave without giving up easy comebacks
>Avery: AEEIOPS 7E PIE.E +11 25
#note a short fish might've been better for avery here - giving free access to the triple word when there previously wasn't one is much worse defensively playing EAU/EF/AE looks nice, giving very little back.
>JD: EGGLNUY F2 LUNGY. +20 31
#note I was trying to choose between LUNGE and LUNGYI, and decided to play for an open board, but LUNGE takes away by far the easiest scoring spot and scores 8 more - GULPY also sims even with LUNGE, 3 ahead of LUNGYI. I think I'm actually fine with my choice. 
>Avery: ADHIOSV 8A SHIVA +49 74
>JD: AEGIKLO 7A OAK +30 61
#note wrong letters available for bingos. missed HOGLIKE fore more points.
>Avery: CDLMOOS 4D CO.DOM +24 98
>JD: AEEGILV 10B VEGIE +26 87
>Avery: IIILLRS B10 .ILLI +16 114
#note nice dump, avery was trying to play fast against me.
>JD: ALOQRTU 3H LOQUAT +39 126
>Avery: ?AIORRS L2 R.SORIAl +66 180
#note the most points he can get here is playing ROSARIA at N1.
>JD: ABDNRRR 11E DRAB +26 152
#note really poor effort, completely spaced on the possibility of playing BRR. not even s
>Avery: DFGHNOS 5K F.HN +20 200
#note nice idea to set himself up, but just GANOF wins a sim
>JD: ENNORRY H11 .ONNY +33 185
>Avery: DEGOSTT 8K G.TED +21 221
#note Q suggested STODGE at O5 cashing in the S as well, but GATED is pretty good
>JD: AEEERRZ K8 .AZER +31 216
>Avery: AEOPSTX 12K .ETAX +40 261
#note reasonable idea to hold onto the S, but he might as well play PRETAX and give himself an extra shot at the blank + 6 more points
>JD: EEJNORT O11 E.ERT +36 252
#note need to block the X and draw a big J play, either at 14J or O1. Keeping JNO actually makes it easier to do this than EJN (4 points more per turn next turn for me) but keeping the second-to-last E is valuable.
>Avery: AAOPSTW O1 TAPAS +35 296
#note PAW at J12 would give him a great chance of interfering with my scoring plays. this leaves him at 60% win instead of 70% (ATAPS also better)
>JD: JNORSTU 14F JU. +26 278
#note tough to see how to win here - there's only one bingo lane at the bottom which he will surely block. A few options I see are JO as a distraction at G1 to fish for RUNNIEST/GAZERS/ET at the bottom, or playing STONE at 13K now to catch up on points and try to draw the blank and hope his leave is awkward. ultimately I decided just to take the points and see if he makes the right plays the rest of the way.
>Avery: ?BDEIOW H1 BE..W +30 326
#note he's 100% win here already with blank draw
>JD: INORSTW 13K STOR. +34 312
>Avery: ?DIINO 15D IrON. +19 345
#note I only have WINOS out so he should block at A4 with DINOS.
>JD: INW A4 WIN.. +12 324
>JD:  (DI) +6 330
#note well done to avery. I gave up my chance of coming back with inaccurate plays such as OAK and DRAB.
