>Matt_Canik: AELOOSW H7 WOO +12 12
#note If I win here, I'm gibsonized for 1st. If I lose, Gabe and I play next round for the championship. However, the world cup final is about to start and we both really want to watch. So I'd better win now- Andy Saunders has greenlit the idea that we play the last game in the hotel bar.

>Matt_Canik: ?ADEOSY J9 SAmOYED +82 136
#note Plays for two more at I4, but this gives the long-term shap I want and creates a really cloasble board if I can make a play at I8. 
>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: ACENT 15J .ECANT +36 110
>Matt_Canik: DEEFIOU I8 DEF +28 164
#note Generally this play is FEU no-brainer, but I really wanted to shut things off now.

>Gabriel_Gauthier-Shalom: IQ C11 QI +24 264
>Matt_Canik: ACEEIMU 4D A.EMIC +22 261

#note I held this for almost 8 minutes until I had 0:09 on my clock. I can only lose by 1 if it's good. I have to challenge.
