#note This is fine. I smell his clock running down, and I'm going to use that against him.
>Winter: AFLOSTV 2J FLOAT +38 153
>Peter_Armstrong: ?AEEKRR N1 s.REAKER +71 218
#note Not a problem.
>Winter: ELPSTVY 8L VE.Y +42 195
#note I'm actually feeling fairlly confident, because he's VERY low on the time, and the board is not that friendly to bingoes.
>Peter_Armstrong: LOX 5D LOX +35 253
>Winter: ELLPST M7 P.L +16 211
#note This was a tough one for me, whether to take points or fish for the bingo, and whether to play PEL or PELL.

Quack approves.
>Peter_Armstrong: DEOW H11 .OWED +33 286
>Winter: CEEILST 1D SECTILE +85 296
#note +5, which is amusing because I played SECTILE(S)* a couple of games earlier against Cheryl, and it stayed on.
>Peter_Armstrong: AAAAA -AAAAA +0 286
>Winter: CDEGGQR I10 C.RED +20 316
#note Peter is really low on time, and after his exchange, if he can't bingo he almost certainly loses after I hit the 36-point Q play (with all those As in the bag). Unfortunately I couldn't take out that D--that's my biggest threat, besides the hot spot at 1L.

Obwiously, Quackle doesn't like my blocking play, but Quackle doesn't understand the time sensitivity and my knowledge that Peter gets flustered when he's low on time, so a tight board benefits me.
>Peter_Armstrong: AAM 1L MA.A +33 319
#note Okay, with that out of the way, I have a solid edge on this board if I can take out that D.
>Winter: AAGGIQT 8A QA. +36 352
#note If he doesn't bingo immediately, I'm golden.
>Peter_Armstrong: NO L1 ..ON +20 339
#note Whew.
>Winter: ABEGGIT B12 BIGG +21 373
#note Once again, hitting those 4s hard is paying off.
>Peter_Armstrong: EU F1 .UE +7 346
#note He's desperate.
>Winter: AEGINTZ 12B ..Z +28 401
#note This was dumb. With just seconds on Peter's clock (or maybe he was already over), I decided that he had no bingo, and that I could go for spread if I drew (Y)EASTING.

Should have looked harder.
