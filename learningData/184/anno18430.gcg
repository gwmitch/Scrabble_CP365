#note I'd never played Josh before but he has a rep for being defensive, so I figured MOOSE would be much more dynamic in opening the board

#note what an odd move. I inferred the case S at least.

#note I can score 30 no problem, but I really need to bingo once or twice to get back into this one. LAW upgrades my bingo percentage to 18% next turn, so I stand by it though it is non-intuitive. I'm likely in trouble if he plays on row 6 anyway, just have to hope he leaves it open.

#note probably not a great idea, but I wanted to represent an X setup and force him to block for no points - it seemed like my best chance of catching up. the best equity play seems to be EAGER at 9A but I liked my plan.
>Josh_Sokol: D B9 .D +7 368
>JD: BEEEGMX 3G X. +34 400
#note his last play now seems to suggest he has the other blank, which is bad news. it's going to be tough to outrun him and none of my blocks look great - Q suggests BEMA at 2L to set up EX. my play gives him more time to fish
>Josh_Sokol: G F11 ..G +4 372
>JD: BDEEEGM 8A EM +18 418
#note EM means that I have a decent chance of hitting BODEGA next turn, which probably still won't be enough to outrun, but gives me a chance at least.
>Josh_Sokol: ?ILOOST 14F SOLITOn +67 439
#note quackle thinks he should fish again, but I think this is wrong - I could make it much harder to bingo by playing something like DOC at K11, and the G also sinks him.
>JD: BDEEGNN 15L EDGE +23 441
#note best play is BEDECK for 7 spread points extra. given the actual pool of CNNO, I was 2/6 to win because I C stick him if he draws CN out of the bag.
