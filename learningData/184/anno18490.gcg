#note BIAXAL, which I didn't know, sims the best and I agree.  I wasn't sure I understood why TAXI and TAXA come out better than TAX though when I'm holding an I and an A though.  It did backfire since he bingoed hooking TAX, but he still would have done so after TAXI or TAXA anyway...

>Sean_Wrona: DEHLLTW D12 TH.W +28 209
#note Clearly I was neglecting the value of the H for some reason and not looking hard enough for other spots, or I ignored them because I wanted to leave the row 2-5 and column L bingo lines open.

#note 21:15
>Sean_Wrona: ABDEILL 1E BIL. +10 219
#note Clearly a play where I lost it because I couldn't see other options and didn't want to block existing bingo lines.  Even ILK is probably better than this since it sets up BILK plays (but that's dangerous because of more likely SILK plays...)

>Sean_Wrona: ADDDELS M11 D.D. +12 231
#note Yet another example of my greatest flaw - not looking for scoring plays when they are infinitely better than my fishy plays.  It's not like I am UNABLE to find things like added, I just have tunnel vision and don't look for them.

>Matthew_O'Connor: FFGINOS 2B GONIF +51 341
#note And since I left that hotspot open, the game is completely over.

>Sean_Wrona: ADEILOS C13 A.O +23 254
#note With five o's remaining, I decided to fish for BIODIESEL (it's cool that I saw this, but still rather unlikely, and if I was going to do this, maybe AH/AG would have been the better fish.  He blocked the spot on the next turn anyway, so it doesn't matter.

#note As Carl Johnson once put it, what's the point of fishing when you need more than a bingo to win?  And this was one of my stupidest fishes in ages...  I definitely paid for it too.  I fully understand why dropping just an E is better, and I have literally NO IDEA why I did this.

#note Okay, he'd have had NONSECURE if I had correctly played MOTE instead of MIG, but I doubt he'd have found that...

Perfect example of a 250-point loss that had little to do with luck.  Okay, I probably wouldn't have won with the luck that I had, but that's no excuse for giving him the line he needed for 3 of his 4 bingos (admittedly, he still had other bingo spots on each of those turns...)
