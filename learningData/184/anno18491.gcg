#note This is *way* too transparent to work and a very stupid thing to do when I already had ADZ...  I would not do this against an expert player, but I managed to get away with it this time.  I can see why HAY is preferred because I can keep ADZ, ADZE, DAZE, etc... to play afterward.  And score almost as much as LAD and ZA scored combined anyway...

>Sean_Wrona: AERSYYZ 10F ZA +64 169
#note And then I'm so fixated on ZA that I seriously miss ZESTY on the next turn.  If I could control my tunnel vision and just see all my obvious plays the way most people at my level seem to be able to do, I could win Division 2 at Nationals.  But I don't hold out much hope of learning to do that in three days.

#note Yeah, IVY/IVIS is the thing to do.  IVY/BY is stupid if she has a T and VERY/BY is stupid if she has an E.  Sigh...  I ended up bingoing there fairly soon but still...

#note I think I was half-fishing for the AIRPOWER extension here but that's not necessarily enough reason to choose this.  I don't think this is too bad though.

#note Oops, had I seen BECOMING I probably could have kept her from bingoing because I doubt she'd have seen PENCILER or PELERINE (I might not have either, but it depends on the day...)
