#note I saw VAS first, then forgot about it.  This is about a 10 pt mistake.  
>Cesar_S: ?DEHIKN 10F KIND. +20 34
#note Turns out I'm genius and prevented him from using that K-VAS hook  cesar: yeah i would have had a bingo. i didn't want to play HIKED after his S telegraph, putting him on something like ANS or ARS but I think overall that HIKED has to be the right play, scores 31, it's aggressive and i have the blank, etc. (-1.5)
>E_Tran: AAELNRS 9H NA. +13 30
#note Though about NANA to set up my S.  But Cesar seemed close to a bingo, too.  I'd rather let him open the board.
>Cesar_S: ?EEEEHT 7I E.E +14 48
#note so putting him on ANS after this still makes EVE sim best. I think there are very few scenarios under which EVE does not sim best, yet, is it the wrong play? maybe? who would play EKE instead of EVE? should i have played IVIED or HIKED?

#note i don't know what my other two tiles were here, but they were two consonants like ND or something similar.
>E_Tran: AAELORW N1 AW +25 211
#note Sim is liking AW or OW at 15N for defense.  It cancels out the x3 lane, and doesn't provide easy overlaps.  OW is also preferred to AW at N1, since OH takes fewer hooks.
>Cesar_S: DDNPPRT -IIIII +0 184
#note lol? keep PR for the 15L overlap possibility is better. (-1.5)

#note Blocking the bottom right is more important than the the pros of GUILE.

>E_Tran: AEENRSW O10 NEW +14 271
#note I was really tempted to do J2 WAN.  Its risky, but very likely to pay off.  On the other hand, the board is very dead, so I can play to hang onto my lead/tempo.  Sim favors 11D WEAN or 11E WAN.  WEAN is completely fine; it allows us to trade pts and get to the endgame.  I was too leery about the hotspot, but it's not too big a concern.
>Cesar_S: EMNPRTY 12H PYR.. +13 247
#note quackle will probably be wrong about plays that don't open the board, so MYC J12 , 4J YUM, etc don't make sense even though they score more or have a better leave. so this is not a -6. KEMPT though, maybe?

>Cesar_S: AEILMNT --  -76 247
#note cesar: i was about 95% sure that MINTABLE was phony because i only remember BAILMENT, but in my exhaustion and annoyance over NAN i somehow thought i might get away with it. I didn't think that melanite or metaling would win. i don't know, it's weird.

#note I mistracked.  Despite giving him this big play, its only 5 pts back.
