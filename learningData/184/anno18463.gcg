#note Ugggh I completely missed BHUT, which looks obvious. I thought Jim might not be sure of the hooks, but it's not worth the equity loss on BHUT.

#note I suppose I could bank on him missing ABROAD again and play H6 GLUG. As it turns out, that likely would have worked. But even if it does, I might have to exchange next turn anyways. I dunno, maybe I should have done GLUG.

#note Really bad. This hurts my bingo chances significantly. I don't know why I didn't just do ABA or something.

#note Already running really low on time here. So playing lots of tiles and giving myself a potentially easy play next turn seemed appealing.

#note Played this immediately with less than 3 minutes left. Wanted to save time in case I needed it for the endgame. M11 ROIL is probably better for forcing the game to end quicker
