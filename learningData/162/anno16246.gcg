#note Trying to stay pretty defensive. Not sure if this is correct
>Craig_Rowland: EINNRST 6C INTERNS +63 92
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CEILMT 12B LiM.ETIC +78 121
#note I was confusing this with LIMNETIC, which was also playable. So is L(I)ThEMIC.
>Craig_Rowland: AAIRU D3 URA.IA +14 106
#note No flinch from Craig, so I continue to think LIMBETIC* is a word.
>Joshua_Sokol: EHHMORU 8A HOR.H +33 154
#note He held this one though, that I only learned from a previous game between Ross and Jackson. I didn't even check it after I saw it on their board, so it could have been phony.
>Craig_Rowland: ALNV H11 V.NAL +24 130
#note Craig is playing quite faster than I am, so I'm starting to worry and cut down on overanalyzing my plays.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGIMSU A8 .UGE +8 162
#note Probably wrong, but it could work.
>Craig_Rowland: CKP 3C P.CK +24 154
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEIMST C11 M.B +12 174
#note I should probably just score here.
>Craig_Rowland: DIQ 5C Q.ID +46 200
#note M(A)ID would have prevented that.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILST 14F LE.DIEST +63 237
#note I still have to play fast here. I sort of recognize that there's a good chance of something being on my rack, but I don't try too long to see it. ISLETED is hard to see, but it seems an improvement over LE(A)DIEST.
>Craig_Rowland: ALUW L10 WAUL. +16 216
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGIOOR H1 REAGI. +27 264
#note I wasn't going to see ORIGA(N) or have the guts to play it if I did see it since I don't know AGINORS that well.
>Craig_Rowland: ENOSX 3H .XONES +42 258
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEIOO 1F OO.IE +5 269
#note I saw how dangerous that O in AXONES was and felt the need to play this. Things aren't looking too well. Hopefully Craig has a lot of consonants.
>Craig_Rowland: JOY L1 JO.Y +44 302
#note wow, dodged a bullet there. Craig said he kept the J with AXONES.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEITVW 1L .IVE +42 311
>Craig_Rowland: ?ADGPSY K9 PAY +31 333
#note There are a few winning plays here and PAY isn't one of them. It looks more like a 65% win. If Craig draws either the W or the Z, he loses. The winning plays are 5J GASP, K9 GAP or DAP, and K5 PA(T)SY.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADETWZ M7 ADZE +31 342
#note This is the only play that might win, since Craig has to see his only win with his tiles. This sets up a second twa out for me if he decides to play aDS N9.
>Craig_Rowland: ?DGRS O1 .DGeRS +7 340
#note He saw it. So close :(
>Craig_Rowland:  (ATW) +12 352
