#note It's either this or 9F/7F KAF.  I chose this because the 7F/9F placements don't really defend anything, and I thought Chris might have something up his sleeve with an S on the next turn; this provides a smidgeon of resistance down the K column and scores almost as well.   Q gives marginal preference to the 9F/7F plays; I'm fine with this.

#note As many times as Chris has had 4-tile exchanges result in ERS + blank bingoes against me, the last thing I wanted to do was open.  The problem with this position was that practically all my options force me to do that if I want to score anything.  Best is ostensibly G7 GYVE, but  I diidn't want to give him the 2x2 line to work with after his exchange; I chose this, hoping that anything he did hit would open up for me, or more likely that he'd have to break his rack apart and grinnd for a bit.  I lost on both counts, and from this point forward the game rapidly deteriorated.
>Chris_Cree: ?ADEGOR K2 DOGEARs +81 95
#note Only bingo for Chris.  And what was it I was saying about his exchanging 4 into a blank bingo?
>Jim_Burlant: ?EELNRZ 3J Z.NE +26 54
#note The question - to play the R or not with ZONER.  Quackle agrees with me - it's best to not play the R.  REZONE 3H is also a good option; while ZONE wins the sim,  in retrospect I wish I'd played REZONE, as I really needed to do a better job keeping the board alive.  39% to win.
>Chris_Cree: BEILR N1 BIRLE +28 123
>Jim_Burlant: ?EELOQR 1L LO.E +21 75
#note Too bad I drew an O instead of an equally probable I, as RELIQuE for 100 would change this game's trajectory quickly.  I considered this, ROLE O5, and ROQuE O5 for 41. 20 points didn't strike me as being enough to pull the plug on the blank, and I thought that whatever he came back with down the O column would still create a line for a 7 that I could hit.   The sim is a toss-up; this choice and  ROQuE are toggling back and forth within 0.2% winning chances and 1 equity point of each other well past 1000 iterations.  In retrospect, I sure wish I'd played ROQUE.
>Chris_Cree: CINTU O5 TUNIC +23 146
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEHOQR I5 HO +12 87
#note Crap.  I expected him to score 30 - 35 down the O column, but I sure didn't expect him to be able to play something ending in C, which really gums up the works.  I sacrificed pionts here to keep the board alive. Quackle wants me to play L3 NOH for 23.  That seems to guarantee I'll just die a slow death by 1000 paper cuts.  20% to win; NOH L3 ostensibly wins 29.  Either way, this isn't looking good.
>Chris_Cree: EEIPTW 4D PEEWIT +30 176
>Jim_Burlant: ?EENQRU F2 QU.EN +36 123
#note Hard to believe that a rack with EENQU? has no playable bingoes, but no bingoes play.  This is best, and QUEER in the same location is a close second.  27% to win - still not looking good.
>Chris_Cree: CFU H1 FUC. +27 203
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEIPR 10N BA +18 141
#note Missing BAGPIPER and RIPPABLE.  If you whiff on the bingoes, this is a solid choice...but I really needed to convert on BAGPIPER or RIPPABLE down the D column.  BAGPIPER wins 28%; this wins 25.  Surprisingly, I only cough up 6 equity with this choice.
>Chris_Cree: ANVY 11K NAVY +27 230
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEIIPR D1 DRI.PIEr +64 205
#note Can someone please explain how I can see DRIPPIER but not recognize DIPPIER?  It's one thing for me to not recognize a low-prob word like BAGPIPER with a blank G.  But missing this is horrible!  12F DIPPIER scores 80 and wins 29%.  This wins 18.  Bleah.
>Chris_Cree: AAH C1 AAH +27 257
>Jim_Burlant: EOORRSU 12J OUR +12 217
#note At least I got this one right.  Back up to 20% winning chances.  Woo hoo.
>Chris_Cree: AM B2 MA +24 281
>Jim_Burlant: ENOOORS -OOO +0 217
#note I saw the obvious C6 ONO and, for only 10 points, didn't like what it did to the board.  I felt that, all things considered, I should try to land one of the T's.  Maybe I should have kept an O and exchanged 2, not 3 here, but whatever.
>Chris_Cree: MOS L3 .OMS +30 311
>Jim_Burlant: AEINNRS 13D INSANER +61 278
#note Or INSNARE.  Kind of a bad sign when your only bingo options barely score 61 points. 7% to win.
>Chris_Cree: IJLT 12A JILT +42 353
>Jim_Burlant: DGLSSTX I12 L.G +8 286
#note Only 4 tiles left in the bag, so I can't exchange.  I did this hoping to set up something he couldn't block down row 15.  I should have known better.  Best looks to be GEDS or GELS 7C.   I have to laugh at the sim - GELS and LEGS/GEDS win roughly 8%.  What miracle could I pull off to win this game even if I find them?  
>Chris_Cree: AW H13 .AW +21 374
>Jim_Burlant: DEISSTX A12 .ETS +33 319
#note Missing SIXTIES B9, not that it matters except for spread.
>Chris_Cree: DEOOORT C7 DOOR +14 388
>Jim_Burlant: DISX 13L SIX +23 342
>Chris_Cree: EOT 14A .OTE +11 399
#note This one definnitely required more skill than I was capable of mustering.  Missing BAGPIPER and putting down the DRIPPIER air ball instead of DIPPIER reduced what little winning chances I had to zero.  But the only real sloppy play came after the win/loss was already decided.  How I missed SIXTIES is beyond me.
