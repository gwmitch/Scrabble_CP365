>Joshua_Sokol: EEENOSU 15H .UE +4 340
#note More defense. I kind of inferred a bingoish rack after so much work on John's part. There were 2 blanks in the bag too, and only M and P to score with on J14

#note More blocking. He can't bingo or score anymore.

#note Since he wasn't playing so many tiles a turn, I guess I wasn't too lucky to draw this blank. I really wanted to play gOOSIER but I was too afraid it wasn't actually good. I knew how good it was defensively.
