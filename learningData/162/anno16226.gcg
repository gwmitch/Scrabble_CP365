>Doug: CGINRTW J6 WR.T +15 15
#note Quackle likes WR(I)TING and WR(I)NG. D: Also considered G4 WRIC(K)  
>Koltonicus: AEEHIOS 10H HOE +18 36
#note K: I gave consideration to K5 HOE. This is more defensive. Quackle likes I7 O(D)EA setting up ETH
>Doug: ?CEGINT H7 r.C.ETING +95 110
#note Doug did good job
>Koltonicus: AEIOSSZ 12E AZO.ISES +84 120
#note The only bingo with that rack.
>Doug: AIIJNTX 13E TAX. +49 159
#note This and 13B JINX are pretty close
>Koltonicus: DIMNRUU 11A DURUM +26 146
#note K: So whatever.
>Doug: IIJLNWY A8 WIN.Y +48 207
#note This is right,,, slightly better than windily. K: I'm just glad he didn't have QINT or something more wrathful
>Koltonicus: BIIMNOT 11K MIB +24 170
#note 11K BI sims evenly with this
>Doug: FIJLPRV -FIJLV +0 207
#note Quackle, you really would play (ZA)P here? You cray.
>Koltonicus: IINOSTT C8 INT.OITS +68 238
>Doug: AEGLPRY 15A RA.PY +39 246
>Koltonicus: DGLOQRV -DGLOQRV +0 238
#note Exchanging is the only real option here. Maybe keeping GO for the ZAG hotspot
>Doug: AEEGHLO 14F GO.E +36 282
>Koltonicus: ?AEEEFR 14A EF. +24 262
#note K: I saw J12 (S)AFE right after I hit my clock
>Doug: AADEHLO D3 HALOED +29 311

>Doug: AEELOOR E3 ALOE +21 332
>Koltonicus: ?EFILNR L3 FLINdER +78 361
>Doug: EJORRTU F2 JO +31 363
#note JOT sims ahead by a little. D: The T is useful for something on row 15 like GROUTIER and helps if I draw the Q
>Koltonicus: ADGILNS N5 LADINGS +73 434
#note An extremely lucky draw given the crap remaining in the bag
>Doug: ENORRTU O1 RETRO +20 383
#note Somehow championship player seems to think that O8 NU wins 2.78% and M2 RE 1.21%. Something at 5K would result in a possible Q stick
>Koltonicus: CEEPQVV 5K Q. +22 456
#note K2 VEEP is best. For some reason
>Doug: ABNU 4D ..BA +18 401
#note Doug had very very little time left and missed I3 BUNA and 1K UNBA(R)

#note C1 PEC for 32
