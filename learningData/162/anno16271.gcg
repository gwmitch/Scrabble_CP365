#note Lowlight Moment #2 - Kolton (who's cool as hell by the way) doesn't challenge but he knew it was phony.  He didn't challenge because he had a nice play on row 15, hooking the E to make CORVINE.  I'm averaging about 4 bimbo moments a tourney.   I must have forgot CORVIN* was phony despite playing the exact same word TWO ROUNDS BEFORE!!!  COVIN is what I should be playing.  To be continued...
