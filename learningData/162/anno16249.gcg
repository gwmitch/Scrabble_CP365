#note this is a big strategic mistake that is not immediately obvious to me. looking at the numbers makes it a bit more obvious though. it should be pretty damn clear that ZONER is giving up WAY more points than ZERO, for only 12 more points (plus GINO is a better leave!)  why did i stop being rational and take the points? one factor that went into consideration was his VAV, and thinking that if he is fishing i'd make him dump his good rack, but why would i want him to do a 40-pt fish? makes no sense. (-9)

#note that's what i am for giving him this play
>cesar: EIKNOTU 11K KI. +35 301
#note i overvalued "OUT" and didn't realize that EINTU was a much better leave than ENOTU. makes sense. (-6)

#note turning point type of play? the play i wanted to make here was 14B TOONIE but it just felt like it gave up too many points. but so does my play! actually my play gives up slightly more points. i didn't want to open up a bingo lane, but i might be ahead by enough. what do you guys think? (-7)
>bruce_w: DETY 2K T.YED +30 289
>cesar: AAEGITU E7 AGITA +24 341
#note this was a bigger turning point play, but now i'm not going to be ahead by enough anyway. quackle likes augite/gateau at 14B; i like GATEAU as there is no O left or IN so the lanes it opens are actually not that strong. i was mostly annoyed that i had played AGITA instead of TAIGA. i didn't want to play TAIGA because i was worried he could even catch up without a bingo (something like TRAYS?) but that is less important than shutting down a lane. (-4.5)

>cesar: AACEGTU O12 GA.A +21 362
#note i was somehow unable to see GAULT. it's very likely i was low on time, i'm very slow and don't make good use of my time when it's my opp's turn. that's bad. (-9)

>cesar: CEEFTTU B7 C.UTE +12 374
#note wow, C7 CRUET is awesome! CHUTE or TEUCH sim best though. maybe i should do TEUCH, but it looked like there were too many bingos from the S.
