>Joshua_Sokol: EEGJNTW H7 JEW +26 26
#note Last game in a tight fight between Montreal and Toronto's teams against a player that I have choked against or gotten epicly beaten by twice already. Let's hope that doesn't happen.
>Jason_Broersma: HIINOOR I6 HONOR +28 28
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EGGNQT J5 TEGG +30 56
#note Didn't like keeping unnecessary consonants here. The sim likes J7 EGG a bit better than J6 EGG for aggressiveness purposes and both a bit less than 1% more than my play. I'm not convinced TEGG was an error.
>Jason_Broersma: ?IIIII -IIII +0 28
#note exch IIILM, kept I?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADNOQU K3 QUA +28 84
#note Do I play K4 DON? I don't like that QUA sets up A(QUA) but usually I can just come back with a bingo on the triple, I think. Sim very slightly prefers not to go for the bingo, cut opp's score and play DON. I score around the same on average after DON than after QUA apparently.
>Jason_Broersma: ?IORTWY L4 TROY +21 49
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DINOSV -V +0 84
#note The sim wants me to play VOIDS or VINOS here over exchanging my V. I just didn't see myself scoring or bingoing after VOIDS.	
>Jason_Broersma: ?IIIIIS -IIII +0 49
#note exchanged iouw, kept IS?
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DFINOS 11C bODFINS +79 163
#note Only bingo in here was INFOlDS. I looked at FOdDINS* but didn't like it and looked at bODFINS* and liked it enough to play it. I was confusing it with BODKINS. No hold.
>Jason_Broersma: ?CINSUX 12B NIX +39 88
>Joshua_Sokol: DEFRTTT M2 FRET +21 184
#note Chose this for blocking purposes, as the AQUA hotspot is still open. It's close, apparently, but FRET comes up on top of the sim's choices by a slim margin.
>Jason_Broersma: ?CEPSTU K8 SUsPECT +75 163
>Joshua_Sokol: IKLNTTY H11 .ITTY +27 211
#note I didn't see 13C TYIN, which is topping the sim by a decent amount. I did this thinking he may have drawn another S after suspect so this would block the hotspot a little bit, but the 4 extra points that TYIN gives me seems to outweigh that detail.
>Jason_Broersma: DEEGLSW 13A WED +22 185
>Joshua_Sokol: BKLNRUZ 12J Z.RK +34 245
#note Here I considered Z(E)BU 12J shortly, Z(E)K and BULK(Y) 15D. I missed a good counteroption, 13E KLU(T)Z. I think I should have gone with BULK(Y) for defense and for saving the Z for a bigger score. Not a huge mistake if it really is one, but interesting nonetheless. All of these five options sim quite close to each other.
>Jason_Broersma: EEGILMS 15K SMILE +41 226
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEILNU 14B BILED +38 283
#note Yeah but... it's INEDIBLE, not UNEDIBLE. I did look there but missed it. I think I would have played it. 50 point mistake right there. I also missed 14K (T)UBED, which looks quite appetizing. Finally, BILED is phony. it's BIELD. BEDU same spot looks decent as well.
>Jason_Broersma: AEGIIRV 2H VIGA +25 251
>Joshua_Sokol: EMNOOPU H1 O.UM +36 319
#note Seemed quite an obvious play, but it may be less so than I thought, with 10D POO not too far behind.
>Jason_Broersma: AAEILRV 10D VAIL +34 285
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEINOP 14J E.APE +30 349
#note I felt like I could probably outrun him at this point. Sim prefers to block (ZERK)S and play 13M AE. Cool idea, but again, E(T)APE isn't looking like a huge mistake.
>Jason_Broersma: AAEHLRU N1 HAE +24 309
>Joshua_Sokol: ADINNNO O1 ANION +42 391
#note This sims best, but I didn't see that it was creating (TART)A(N).
>Jason_Broersma: AAAELRU G4 AE +6 315
#note At this point I saw the pool from my perspective, which was AAAELOORRU. Game over. I just outscore if he can irk out a bingo. We were kibitzing and Jason said that there was the possibility of something starting in A with (TART)A(N), which I heard as (TART)E(N), which I didn't think was good. He kept saying that he couldn't even fish for anything. I showed him that he couldn't even get the S, which I had on my rack. Then he found this play, which performs pretty well with an apparent 2% win or so. From his perspective, he has to draw OR for AURORAL, which is available in two spots. 4G A(M)A does better than that, which can draw into more things. Since he knows I have an S, he has a 1/18 percent chance to draw his bingo. Slick play. Before he did this I was telling him that if he pulled off the win I would idolize him forever. Promises are promises.
>Joshua_Sokol: BCDEINS 4F B.. +7 398
#note I saw what he was going for, and that he had a 2/3 chance of having it after his play. I briefly considered that if I blocked and he had AURORAL he would try TARTAN and that TARTAN was phony. I had 9 minutes on my clock. I decided that I wanted to be greedy and fish for a bingo and that either he would have to lose spread and block me or try a phony. All of this considering took only a few seconds and I laid this down and hit the clock. If I had only thought about worst case scenarios instead of being overconfident. I had so many ways to outscore for sure.
