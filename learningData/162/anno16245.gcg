>Joshua_Sokol: DEINOUZ H4 ZONED +50 50
#note How on earth does exch U even compete with this? Jeez... Maybe because all game I never saw BLA(ZONED).
>Zev_Kaufman: EEILOPR 6B LEPORI.E +64 64
>Joshua_Sokol: GIILRUX 7C XI +38 88
#note I also don't understand why LUR(E)X is competing with XI. I can save LUR(EX) for next turn.
>Zev_Kaufman: DIORT 5G T.ROID +18 82
>Joshua_Sokol: GHILRRU C3 LUR.. +24 112
#note I guess I can still save LUREX and play 4J GHI.
>Zev_Kaufman: IQ 4K QI +39 121
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEGHIR 8D GIE +14 126
#note I guess I didn't look at the A/I tile distribution and played 8D GAE instead.
>Zev_Kaufman: MN 4B M.N +10 131
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEEHRY 3L YEH +25 151
#note Or HEY. I actually thought HEY took an S. 
>Zev_Kaufman: DNO 2M DON +21 152
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEFORT 1N FA +30 181
>Zev_Kaufman: AEINNSS M5 SIENNAS +67 219
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIORRT 11F REORBIT. +70 251
#note This was a huge mistake. I have phonied with REORBIT(ED) before and it was accepted so that is why I thought ORBITER/REORBIT was a thing. Zev held me for a while and I was really surprised when he let go, as I realized it was bad after hitting the clock. He was more disappointed at himself after the game was over.

>Zev_Kaufman: EFR N6 FR.E +32 314
>Joshua_Sokol: ACGGLSV -GAGCVL +0 321
#note I really thought this was a good play, I felt like I needed a blank to win, but the sim doesn't like it. Does someone have a suggestion? Maybe keep the C too? The L? The pool is quite vowel heavy I guess.
>Zev_Kaufman: AINU 10C UNAI +11 325
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACJOPS J2 JO +30 351
#note Nice draw I got.
>Zev_Kaufman: IOTV H10 V..ITO +33 358
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACLPST 15C CAPiT.LS +62 413
#note It took me forever to see this. I've just never seen or anagrammed anything with CAPLTS in it, whether it's an I for COALPIT/CAPITOL or an E for POLECAT. I should have seen CALTR(O)PS, a word that I'm comfortable with. I was very close to playing (O)PTiCALS* or G5 (TI)P when I saw CAPITOLS. 
>Zev_Kaufman: AAAY -  +0 358
#note challenged cause this tournament wasn't based on spread.
>Joshua_Sokol: CGGSUUV C9 V.G +11 424
#note I saw the pool and stopped worrying.
>Zev_Kaufman: AAAAETY J10 A.AYA. +15 373
#note Blank in the bag, crazy.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CGSUU 13J .UCaS +18 442
#note -3. He challenged anyway.
