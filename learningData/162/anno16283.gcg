#note I thought it wasn't a good idea to throw away such promising tiles for 28, but nothing really jumped out at me. This is neck and neck with 2 other plays, (I)MPANEL in the same spot for 28 as well, and the fishy (E)M 7L for 7. They all have merit, the two longer plays score a bunch more and with ??SSSS out, playing 6 is not the worst thing to do. The fish does give a nice lane though, and leaves good stuff.
>Chris_Kulig: ELZ M1 LEZ +50 162
#note Ouch.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEIJOOR N1 ORE +26 124
#note Missed (K)OJI completely, which is much better than anything else. I also missed Quackle's second favorite play, COO(T)IE N10. This seems fine. The other main plays I considered were COI(L)ER 1J and and (M)O 12H (Since on the board, D,E,R,S all bingo with CEIJOR). They finish 4th and 3rd respectively on the sim, surprisingly. However, a bunch of plays sim close to those two, so it's not a huge deal to miss those.

#note Miss (K)OJI once shame on me. Miss (K)OJI twice shame on me again.
>Chris_Kulig: IIIII -IIIII +0 198
>Morris_Greenberg: BCGIOOT M9 COGO. +20 168
#note This and COGI(T)O N9 seem best, the sim switches back and forth between them. BIOG 2H isn't far behind, and the awesome GOBIO(ID) H2 is next in line.

>Morris_Greenberg: ?ABEHIT 14B HABITE. +30 222
#note Yup, I did just miss THEBAIn(E), also HABITu(D)E. Speedy player likes this next best after the two bingoes, but it looks wrong to me now. It really closes down the highest two bingo lanes, and doesn't really open up anything better. If I miss the bingos, N12 E(T)H looks a whole lot better.
>Chris_Kulig: NRU 13A RUN +15 271
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AABINN 15C BANI +21 243
#note Did not know cINNABA(R) nor BANIANs. This seems like the best non-bingo.
>Chris_Kulig: IRST O6 STIR +23 294
>Morris_Greenberg: ??AAENU 12G A.A +12 255
#note Wow, I missed NAUsEAs completely. This is why I should study during the year. However, bingoing here is not necessarily right. Both plays score 60ish, and with HVWWY, he has a great chance of outrunning me since he's only down by around 10 after NAUsEAs. Still, this is not the best non-bingo according to Quackle, it likes N9 UN or AN, probably because it's a very consonant heavy bag. I would never have thought to leave 3 vowels with the blanks though.
>Chris_Kulig: DENOW A8 DOWNE. +33 327
#note After seeing his rack, it makes a lot of sense Quackle liked the N9 spot last turn, it blocks most of the high point 31 point plays like AW, OW, AH, OH, and AY.
>Morris_Greenberg: ??ELNSU 2J US +9 264
#note I saw UNLooSE B4 for 70, but completely missed the awesome 9s like eUgLEN(ID)S and NUcLEo(ID)S for 77! I was pretty low on time though. I thought US was a creative play that would be better than a 70 poitn bingo, since, I'd be losing with the bag empty after a 70 point play, while this gives me an unblockable high-ish point lane. Right idea to not bingo and create a higher point lane, bad execution. B5 LUNE is killing the sim with over a 60% chance of winning! The problem with US is that while he can't really block it, my chances of bingoing there with one of HVWY is pretty low, which are the only bingoes that would be high enough to outrun Chris.
>Chris_Kulig: EHILRVW H5 WH.. +11 338
#note If you infer ?? after my last play, no play wins 100% of the time here for him. VIR(ID) H4 looks best though.
>Morris_Greenberg: ??AELNR 1D RELeArN +70 334
#note I had under 2 minutes at this point so I didn't think this out as much as I would've liked. I was choosing between this and L(AMA) 12F. L(AMA) wins about 32% of the time, all bingoes win about 2.5%. Huge mistake.
>Chris_Kulig: EGILRVY B5 GYVE +22 360
#note He missed (P)IU.
>Morris_Greenberg: IU J13 .IU +7 341
