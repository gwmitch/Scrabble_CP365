#note -8 because i missed HAZARDS. a disappointing miss but it's not a huge mistake i think.

#note bues is a better leave actually, so pow is better (-1)
>mike_baker: IIII -IIII +0 139
>cesar: EGJOPSU 7D PUJ. +13 254
#note i can assume he kept CE? here. B1 EGO is undoubtedly the best move. do you guys agree? why did i not play it, or why did i play PUJA instead of JUGA? JUGA is a decent play. (-9)

>cesar: EGIOSVY 10J GOY +21 275
#note being that i utterly failed at controlling the board, and i'm actually fairly low on time now, i need to start making equity plays. i think this is right, even though it opens up two more lanes. what else makes sense?
>mike_baker: DGO 11K GOD +23 245
>cesar: AEIPSUV 9C PEAV. +16 291
#note my time here is very low, i think i was at about ~3-4 minutes, which is bad. i am going to start tracking where i spent the most time, but the majority was spent on HUN and PUJA, two moves that ended up being terrible, so i don't know what i'm doing. i knew this was going to be bad, but i wanted to just play something and didn't realize until i hit the clock the QI spot it opened up. i also considered SUE 12K, (YO)U, F9 AVE, or DIVA, all of which make some sense. i don't understand the train of thought that led to peavy and that makes me keep making plays like that. but i do know it had to do with my remaining time, so i need to be faster. (-12.5)
>mike_baker: EITT C9 .ETTI +14 259
>cesar: IIMOSTU 12J ISM +31 322
#note at ~2 minutes i decide i can try to outrun him. i didn't play B10 MI because there's a lot of easy ways for him to score i think. however i think it still puts me up by a bingo plus i keep an S! my S is very important. i need to play faster. (-9.5)
>mike_baker: Q 13B Q. +11 270
>cesar: AIIORTU D11 OI +10 332
#note it's gotta be a time thing, but my thought was basically that playing 14A OI was giving up too many points and i wouldn't be able to hit the triple lane myself. but chances are he won't hit it as the lane requires more specificity than the one on column N, plus it's 16 more points!! i have to take it...
