#note I took a long time here because I was trying to decide on the right bingo.  I have a nice lead so I ignored FATTIES at 14F because it opens up a major bingo lane on row 15.  I thought of passing up the bingo to play FIAT, but then noticed the open S.  If I play the right bingo, I can get rid of four lanes.  So I play FAINTEST instead.  Will said he thinks I made the right play.

#note Lowlight Moment #3:  I'm going to review my fours again.  I didn't write my rack down here, but I could have played BEAU.  And it all went down from here, folks.  I played like a bonehead from here on out and ran my clock down to mere seconds.  To be continu- wait, Will already posted his version.  Saves me the trouble.  Aw, man...I could have added his racks....
