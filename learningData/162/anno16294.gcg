#note It's a really good thing I drew all these E's. I thought he had EIRSTV? on his rack and that I was done for, that I would lose and John would be gibsonized, since at this point he had just enough wins for me to catch up to him. This turns out to be the best move.

#note I really didn't understand why John was grumbling as I had him with a million bingos on his rack. Turns out I mistracked and he was complaining about there being so many e's left and him drawing none of them. I really lucked out after making some bad decisions in the preendgame.
