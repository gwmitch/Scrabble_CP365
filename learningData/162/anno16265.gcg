#note Confusing position, burned almost all my time on it. HEMIPTERAN/AA would have been an insanely stylish play but I am but a mere mortal. I did RADIAL to block EX/XI but I think Jerry will not have that enough to make it worth blocking, especially given that he'll just play on row 1 and score 40+ anyway. Quackle likes fishy plays after the HEMIPTERAN fit, but that seems an unnecessary risk. I think this is an OK play regardless to save a few points and reach for the X myself - but of course, 14E AA was the star play.

#note I have the case hook to GO so this seemed pretty strong - but Quackle says it is quite weak compared to D3 TWO. TWO offers much better defense, not allowing plays like D4 TOY afterwards, and keeping TIES is pointless on a board like this - keeping the other W for scoring is more valuable.
