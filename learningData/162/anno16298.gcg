#note These exchanges were either ridiculously bad luck, frustration or a mix of both. John wasn't happy to be playing me so many times, but I was the only one that could catch him at this point.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFFLNV D10 F.EF +20 320
#note Really unsure why I played this, besides its defensive merits. There are many superior plays.

>Joshua_Sokol: MNRSUVW D3 V.W +9 397
#note Securing the win, but H1-H9 seems more dangerous than what this blocks, so this is better at 6E.

#note I noticed the spot after he played JUT, and just finalized my blocking.

#note C9 HI(D)DEN is really cool
>Joshua_Sokol: AENPRRS G1 RAPS +26 468
#note 6A (HI)NS to block his out. Spread was completely irrelevant at this point, since I had a tie, he was up by .5, and I had around 800 points of spread more than John.
