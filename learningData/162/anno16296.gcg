#note I saw CHARIOT and wrote down HARICOT. I didn't think it was a word in English, but in French it's the common word for the string bean family. Same in English, but I really had no way of knowing at the time :(

#note Oh boy. I think I took a while to make a play here, but I have thought TORILA* was a word so many times before. This doesn't seem like the right play even if Paul doesn't challenge.

#note Here I was starting to worry a fair amount. NO was a good play and I drew the Q. I think I should play 3H C(EL)L but then he's less worried about drawing the Q... hmm

#note Seems the counterintuitive F7 (BO)L(T) gives me my best chance here. Paul could have saved himself had he played (X)I instead. He's running out of time and I think I am too. My chances are basically a coin toss now if Paul plays perfectly
