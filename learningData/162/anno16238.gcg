>Joshua_Sokol: AEENNOR 11H ONE +25 58
#note (H)EREON is a worthy option.
>Craig_Rowland: ?AILSTU 12B TULAdIS +71 114
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEENRR 13H EARNER +21 79
#note 13D ARENE, I chickened out.
>Craig_Rowland: FOOR 12L ROOF +28 142
>Joshua_Sokol: DDEEINT O12 .END +24 103
#note DENTILED, ENDITED. Not words I should be missing.

>Craig_Rowland: EGO 9E EGO +10 240
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADEHLN D3 HANDLEs +76 250
#note hANDHEL(D) is another bad miss. I didn't know HEaDLAN(D). It would have prevented what ensued as well.
>Craig_Rowland: SSV 13A V.S +16 256
>Joshua_Sokol: AILMORT C2 MOLA +26 276
#note Not sure what to do here. Sim is liking C2 TOM and E2 LIMO much more.

>Craig_Rowland: DEFS B1 DEF +31 332
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIRTTW F6 WE +28 334
>Craig_Rowland: LSS H10 ....L +8 340
#note There is the reason that hANDHEL(D) is so much better than HANDLEs.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIRTTTY 14D TITT.E +10 344
#note Probably the best option for me. I also considered I13 (A)IR, but he just plays S(R)I and outscores.
>Craig_Rowland: ACGISS L4 CASI.G +18 358
#note He has 15A ASCI available.
>Joshua_Sokol: EORRUVY G3 VERY +25 369
#note Apparently this is my best shot. It's almost a 50% win according to the sim.
>Craig_Rowland: BJKOOSW 5K J.W +26 384
>Joshua_Sokol: GIIORU 6L .ORI +11 380
#note Best by 17 points. I have to hope he chickens out on B(I)SK, but that's not going to happen.
>Craig_Rowland: BKOOS O5 B.SK +30 414
#note M11 B(OR)K is apparently best.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIU -  +0 380
#note Challenged cause I'm playing for the win and you can never be too sure.
>Craig_Rowland: OO 9L .OO +5 419
>Craig_Rowland:  (GIU) +8 427
#note So I missed important bingos but at least I played well otherwise.
