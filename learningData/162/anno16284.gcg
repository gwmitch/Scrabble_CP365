>Chris_Kulig: AIJOR 7D RIOJA +22 22
>Morris_Greenberg: EEOPQSY 6B SEEPY +39 57
#note Ooh, missed POESY in the same spot for 2 more.
>Chris_Kulig: ?AEEIMX L8 .XIME +28 50
#note He spent awhile here, I liked AMIE 8A, but either play is reasonable. EX 8D is also good.
>Morris_Greenberg: EIOQRUU 8A QUIRE +54 111
#note I really did consider QUERI(ER) D1 for 2 less since I have another U so I have a much better chance of scoring on the triple with the Q than he does in most situations. However, it is risky, and I didn't like how it made the 8A triple so many more points. Still, QUERI(ER) sims about 2% higher.
>Chris_Kulig: ?AEENTV 12E VENErAT. +61 111
#note Boy, am I lucky he missed K6 VE(G)ETANt.
>Morris_Greenberg: EGIOOUY K5 GOU.E +23 134
#note I was mad that he blocked (G)OOEY. This and OU(T)GO are moving back and forth as the best option in the sim.
>Chris_Kulig: ADF M10 FAD +28 139
>Morris_Greenberg: EFHINOY N10 FE +35 169
#note Setting up the Y.
>Chris_Kulig: ACRT H11 R.CTA +21 160
#note Could've blocked my setup with TAR(IFF)!
>Morris_Greenberg: AHINORY O7 AHOY +43 212
>Chris_Kulig: EIS 13L SEI +37 197
>Morris_Greenberg: GINRTUU A8 .UIRT +15 227
#note Might as well fish for (QUIRT)ING since I have the last G.
>Chris_Kulig: AHP J4 PAH +32 229
>Morris_Greenberg: DGKNSUW I3 WUD +20 247
#note Wanted to keep the NG, sim agrees as D(A)WK J11, this, and J11 W(A)UK are the best 3 plays.
>Chris_Kulig: CEINNT N2 INCENT +22 251
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BGKLNS J8 .LK +27 274
#note Burn the blank now for (QUIRT)iNG? I thought since he can't play it, I can wait, although, it's very blockable, so perhaps play it safe.
>Chris_Kulig: ABOS H1 BOAS +32 283
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BGINSZ A8 .....ING +54 328
#note Wow, which of BIZNaG(A)S 15B, ZINGS L1, and (QUIRT)ING do you play? BIZNaG(A)S wins the sim, unsurprisingly because it blocks most of the remaining bingoes.
>Chris_Kulig: ELO E10 LO.E +14 297
>Morris_Greenberg: ?BORSWZ L1 BROWS +32 360
#note I am feeling pretty good at this point, just made a play that seems reasonable, with SZ? and a 60 point lead, it's hard for me to lose here.
>Chris_Kulig: AEILNOT 15H .LEATION +77 374
>Chris_Kulig: AEILNOT --  -77 297
#note I accidentally blocked TAIL(B)ONE in the process I guess.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?LNRTVZ 15G T.V +6 366
#note Lots of plays win 100%. Since I know DD is in the bag, I figured I'd make it so he can't block both ADZ spots.
>Chris_Kulig: AEILNOT B13 TAO +15 312
#note He had less than a minute.
