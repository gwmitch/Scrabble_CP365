#note So excited that this word still played that I missed the much superior placement one spot over.
>Nigel: IT 9B IT +11 160
>Will: AINOOUX 12K OXO +45 242
#note Almost did AUXIN after the strength-signal of IT but I figured most of the time I'd just be needlessly giving up points, and the game is pretty close.

>Will: AABENSU O7 UNBA. +21 293
#note I was not aware of what I was doing with this play until next turn, sadly. If I want to avoid future problems with UNBAN I should play O8 BANNET, and 14J BEANS scores a lot too.
>Nigel: IQS K5 QIS +32 297
>Will: AAEHOOS 13C HO. +24 317
#note Now I see it (N9 AZO) - fortunately I drew the final A. I just have to hold onto the last A's like the precious jewels they are until hopefully landing the Z. If Nigel gets Z?, that'd be bad news regardless.
>Nigel: EEKLLRZ -KELLER +0 297
>Will: AACEOSY 13I COY +18 335
#note Counterintuitive, but I didn't mind playing this - F10 NAY is a normal and decent play but after Nigel's x6 it seemed likely he picked up a blank, and taking out the easiest line was a worthwhile goal. The stronger I think Nigel is here, the better COY becomes - and at the very least I know 6 tiles in the bag are for sure not blanks so his rack is better than an unadjusted Quackle sim thinks it is.
