#note i thought vitta would sim a little better, but wasn't 100% sure it didn't take the S and didn't want to deal with that. still, i was like 80% sure so i should just play it. (-2)

#note tough move here, i think BEE might be better. i'm forcing her to end the bingo in E if she wants to use that lane rather than give her some options like ED, ER, etc. i thought of REFINE as well and was unable to see that it's actually a pretty decent move. i thought it needlessly opened up bingo 8 lanes, but it opens up what, 1 8 lane?

#note i didn't really consider an exchange here. i didn't want to be too consonant heavy but i need the blank (and the S too probably) to win. IOdIN sucks, i need to be super lucky for her not to use the spot. EIdE maybe.
