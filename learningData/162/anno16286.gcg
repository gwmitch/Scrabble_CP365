#note Final game of the matchup! Even though I've played a bit sloppily, it's tied 2-2 meaning this one is all or nothing to move on. I go first since I have more spread. Unfortunately, I decide to make my biggest mistake during this game at a crucial moment. This opening rack is interesting, any of XYST, TAX, and STAGY seem reasonable. Seems like a rack for the TWL strategy page on facebook.

#note Didn't like the triple (F)IXT opened up, and missed DITHE(R)Y. This sims second behind DITHE(R)Y, (F)IXT is third.

#note Didn't like what (R)EIFY and (R)EEFY opened up. This sims second after (R)EIFY.

#note E(XU)DE is an awesome play I completely missed. Thisis second best.

#note He asked after the game if SAMOVAR was a proper noun or not. I'm lucky he talked himself out of it.

#note Only bingo that plays there for him, best.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEINNOP A13 APO +24 252
#note This is a mistake, I was overly focused on a short word here, and completely missed A11 PANNE.
>Chris_Kulig: BDEI N10 B.EDI +28 274
>Morris_Greenberg: EEINNNR O12 NENE +23 275
#note I was choosing between 3 plays NINE O7, NENE O12, and (YOUR)N L8. Although (YOUR)N is cool, there are only 1 S and 1 D, so INNER(V)E_ in the A column is very unlikely, and the other bingo lane on column O is very likely to be blocked. I decided to play NENE over NINE simply because of the extra 7 points. I could be burned in either spot, and although it's easier to make a play in the NINE spot, the NENE spot will score more on average if he can play there. These three plays are the top 3 plays in the sim, and are within 0.3% of each other winwise. One other play that is just behind them is (PA)NNE 14A to set up another bingo lane. All 4 seem reasonable, thoughts on which is best?

>Morris_Greenberg: AHINPRS 10H NAH +28 303
#note He is getting pretty low on time, and I wanted to pressure him. So, I spent little time on this play, this and PAH in the same spot both seemed reasonable, I thought the P could be more valuable at this point though. This is actually third best according to the sim, with HIN E5 being the best, then PAH, then this.

#note Key thing to note here: 1 vowel in the pool, a ton of junk otherwise. Therefore, setting up my S and keeping all of my vowels is a REALLY good idea. This wins 89% of the time, and with C7 T(R)IP crushes in the sim. What trip does that is nice is blocks one of his 2 spots for M(O)CK, and it scores 21 to make it a closer game. Still, both are really strong plays.
>Chris_Kulig: DEKMNVZ 14F ZE. +34 356
#note Z(O)NK is a bit better, he's at 83% win here, vs. 85% with Z(O)NK.
>Morris_Greenberg: EIILSTT F5 ET +15 323
#note Note to self, realize how many points STILT or STILE actually is! I completely shank this endgame, I try to be cute and stick his V here, but that's completely unnecessary. I should go out in 2 so that he is stuck with a ton of stuff because he can't play most of it in this coming turn. I played sort of sloppily in this matchup, and deserved to lose as I did. It is frustrating though that I could've won it had I actually thought about the endgame more. This was good practice for getting back into scrabble, hopefully I won't botch a tournament endgame in this way in the near future.
