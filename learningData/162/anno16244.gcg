#note note that exchange 7 is wrong here as many people would do (and better than just keeping the R). DIR is better than R.

#note one of the things to do here is to not be negative. it's funny how much different tournaments are than casual games. in a casual game i wouldn't even give alations a thought and just keep playing. in a tournament game i start thinking about my record, or how i need to win this game, or that it's not a blank bingo so he might draw the blank, etc. that needs to stop.
>eric: BEGOOT G4 BOOT.EG +12 90
#note now i'm thinking of how he's going for the blank and might get it.
>cesar: AINRRST H1 TRAIN +25 68
#note fishing is wrong here, TRAIN brings me close enough already. i was making decent strategic decisions i would have screwed up a couple years ago... or on the third day of any tournament.
>eric: EET H12 .EET +25 115
>cesar: DEHINRS M7 NERDISH +86 154
#note to me it was pretty clear that NERDISH was a much better move than HINDERS for defensive reasons. a big tile at L8 can burn me but it doesn't happen that often and WEET suggested he might be vowel heavy.
>eric: JNO 8L J.ON +57 172
#note that's unfortunate
>cesar: AHLMTUX F5 HM +29 183
#note i failed to see HALLUX over the board but i very easily saw it in quackle. i need to start bringing my own one-sided scoresheets (i like taking notes in the back but i usually will default to whatever the tourney has, which isn't good). it might have been better to just make my own. i barely had any note taking space on the tourney scoresheets.

>cesar: AAELTUX 2F LU.EX +30 213
#note LUXATE sims best here, but only by about a point. i really did not want to play that. maybe i was feeling paranoid after JEON, but i think even then i'm just giving up a lot of points. i don't like volatilizing the board in general when i don't need to. (-1)

>cesar: AAFRTUV D1 FRAT +31 278
#note K3 FAVA or TUFA are worthconsidering here or even 9C FAUVE or 4B FAVA. FRAT is not a very good play because it gives up a lot and it keeps a terrible leave. but i find things wrong with all the other plays. how do i open the board if i do K3 FAVA? he's just going to overlap there. tough move i don't know the answer to. (-7)
>eric: CEE J1 E.EC +13 323
#note he laid this down incredibly quickly.

#note sheesh, i missed an awesome bingo here!! although honestly i'm likely to lose after it since it empties the bag and he just can plan an out in two (-47)
>eric: EO 9K .O.E +16 416
>cesar: ADEEINZ B10 ZANIE. +70 411
#note zanier or zander? clearly the bag is vowel heavy and i would like to go out next turn.
>eric: DIIOOSU 11B .UDIOS +25 441
#note it was only a matter of time for him to find the only win and he had over 10 minutes on his clock.
>cesar: DEEK L12 .E +12 423
#note don't know what i'm hoping for here.
>eric: IO 5E ....O +10 451
#note he would have tried OILILY if it came down to it so i was going to lose the game no matter what.
