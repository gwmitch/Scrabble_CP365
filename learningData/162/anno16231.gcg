>Joshua_Sokol: ?LMRSTU H7 LUM +10 10
#note I start the game off missing LUSTRUM. I guess I didn't look for long enough.
>Roger_Cullman: AIIRY 7D AIRI.Y +14 14
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIRSTT E5 SH.TTIeR +90 100
#note I guess TR(I)lITHS, TR(I)STIcH and TH(I)RTIeS are more defensive here. I didn't know the first two. Would anyone play 8A SITH here for greediness purposes? I feel like I will score like 30 next turn anyway and RT? doesn't really guarantee an 80 points+ bingo next turn.
>Roger_Cullman: EEY D3 EYE +14 28
>Joshua_Sokol: AAAGHRZ 6H GAZAR +47 147
#note I could potentially keep the Z for next turn here with something like 12C AA(R)RGH, which may have drawn a challenge, but I obviously didn't spot something that awesome. This is probably still better though, as the H is nice on this board too because of H(AIRILY), H(M) and C1-C6. The only large downside could be a 2x2 by Roger.
>Roger_Cullman: ?EIMNOR I9 MORaINE +71 99
#note R(A)dIOMEN was that 2x2.
>Joshua_Sokol: AADEGHT H14 AH +32 179
#note Oh my God. HEADGATE for 185. Good thing that 1) I didn't know it and that 2) there wasn't any high turn award for this tournament. I also missed a shitload of other plays, HAED and AHED H12, AAHED H11, HAD H13... I really don't know where my headgate was at this turn.
>Roger_Cullman: FOX 5K FOX +38 137
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGPQTU 13H P.QUET +42 221
#note I don't think I want to play QUAT(R)E. It seems like it would give me too much to worry about later on.
>Roger_Cullman: DIOT 4L DOIT +29 166
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGKUWW 12L WAUK +44 265
#note Aww, he blocked GAWK.
>Roger_Cullman: NOS 3K NOS +31 197
>Joshua_Sokol: ADGNNRW O8 DRAN. +30 295
#note I guess O4 (T)WANG is a slightly better idea, not that it really matters.
>Roger_Cullman: DEI O1 EDI. +15 212
>Joshua_Sokol: AGINOSW C3 WO +25 320
#note Me no scared.
>Roger_Cullman: AEILNOT B4 TOENAIL +67 279
#note He didn't see that B1 ELATION fit. He also blocked my GUINEAS :(
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGINSU 14F GU..INE +35 355
#note Or GU(AN)IN or A5 GAUN. They all look like very decent choices. Choose one!
>Roger_Cullman: DEOV 15L DOVE +40 319
>Joshua_Sokol: AGNSSTV 8A V.T +18 373
#note I missed GNAT/GNATS A5 for scoring purposes. Those seem like good plays.
>Roger_Cullman: EF J10 FE +28 347
#note N10 FE(U) is one more.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGNOSS N10 NO.S +30 403
#note At this point I was having so much trouble retracking that I even called the director to ask if we needed to make sure no tiles were missing. Roger suggested I just count that there were 80 tiles on the board, which I did, and which there were. For some reason I couldn't count that all the Ts and Ns were gone... I was actually trying to find my mistakes for a whole 5 minutes, since I still had 18 minutes on my clock at the start of the turn.
>Roger_Cullman: BJ -  +0 347
#note NOUS was Challenged.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEGIS F6 E.A +14 417
#note I still thought NT were in the pool, so I didn't play E3 AE, which I briefly considered. This play was correct, but so was any play with AE really.
>Roger_Cullman: BJ 10D J.B +18 365
>Joshua_Sokol: ABEGIRS G10 BIG +21 438
#note I spent a while looking for some cool plays but I saw none. 12A BRIE(R)/BRIA(R) look like my best choices, but that's if Roger doesn't challenge JIBB.
>Roger_Cullman: CCELLP -  +0 365
>Joshua_Sokol: AERS D12 EARS +14 452
>Joshua_Sokol:  (CCELLP) +24 476
#note Could've hit 600 if I had known to play H(E)ADGATE, but not to worry, I still had high game for my game vs Jackson.
