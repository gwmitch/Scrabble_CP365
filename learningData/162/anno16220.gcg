>Matthew_Larocque: HNU H7 HUN +12 12
#note Seriously, how could I not at least write down the first rack?
>Eric_Tran: IUUVV -IUUVV +0 0
>Matthew_Larocque: AELNOST G4 TOLANES +70 82
#note I7 ETALONS? Well it is 1 extra point, but allows him to bingo to the S which I wasn't a fan of.
>Eric_Tran: IIPT H1 TIPI +24 24
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIQSTX 2G Q. +11 93
#note I'm drawing really well here. But let's not get too excited, I'll find a way to nosedive this game into the ground.
>Eric_Tran: FINO F9 FOIN +19 43
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMSTX E11 XI +38 131
>Eric_Tran: AHOY D12 HOYA +34 77
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEMSTV 14A CAV. +24 155
#note Not the draw I was hoping for, but I'm still in decent shape. However, I was too focused on keeping my leave strong... so I never even considered plays like VAC(A)TE or C(A)VEAT. Although this keeps a good leave, he's almost guaranteed to outscore me with the nice opening I'm giving him.
>Eric_Tran: BEESZ A10 ZEBE.S +66 143
#note yeah, that was bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLMST 15D .LGAMEST +83 238
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLMST --  -83 155
#note And this.... well.... it's kind of tragic really. I spend far too much time on most turns, but I did not spend nearly enough on this one.
>Eric_Tran: CEIR 15D .REIC +21 164
#note No second chances.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGLMST B9 GAME +30 185
#note Tough call, GAM or GLAM are probably better. After my epic fumble though, now I'm paranoid about giving him any kind of a chance to hammer me. Sims says GLAM > GAM > GAME > GLEAM.
>Eric_Tran: ABK I6 KAB +22 186
>Matthew_Larocque: DLLORSU 6D LUL. +6 191
#note Here we go - miss a bingo and never get close to another bingo all game. My win % is already starting to plummet. Should I just take the points with DUROS C6? I think I was slightly unsure if DURO took the S, though.
>Eric_Tran: AF 14F FA +28 214
>Matthew_Larocque: DORSTTU 4D TUT.. +10 201
#note Yeah, okay. But now I know PRUTOT is the plural of PRUTA, and I didn't even know PRUTA which is a form of currency from Israel.
>Eric_Tran: ?AENRRT 13G REgRANT +68 282
>Matthew_Larocque: DJOOORS 7A DOJO +22 223
#note Now that I have an S-hook to work with, need to go for broke. So uh, gimme bingo?
>Eric_Tran: EIVW 3A WIVE +22 304
>Matthew_Larocque: ADIOORS A5 DO.O +18 241
#note You can't deny me forever, tile bag. Of note - ARD(U)O(U)S is mind-blowing. 41 points playing through 2 disconnected Us? Perhaps my only chance at redemption. I pretty much can't win anymore.
>Eric_Tran: IO 12L OI +10 314
#note Now now, Eric, no need to rub it in.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIILRS 6I .I +8 249
#note I kinda hate these single tile fishes, but what else? SAILER is a pretty strong leave that warrants the gamble, and plays like RETAILS/REMAILS/REDIALS would play down the N column.
>Eric_Tran: DEEGW K4 WEDGE +28 342
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILRRS 1H .RAILERS +77 326
#note Ok, so I did get to bingo again.
>Eric_Tran: ?DEENPU N1 .EPUgNED +74 416
#note But so did he.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGMNRSY 8K .MY.S +42 368
#note Accidentally doubled the Y instead of the M for some reason and scored it as 45.
