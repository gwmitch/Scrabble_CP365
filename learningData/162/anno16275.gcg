#note Decisions, decisions. Didn't think this one through much, and there's quite a bit to think about here. PEH, PECHAN, HEP, ZEP, CHEAPO, CHEEP. HEP > PEH because of scoring spots. CHEAPO and CHEEP seem better than PECHAN because it gives back a lot more next turn, something I didn't really consider fully. Kind of dislike ZEP because it is close to HEP/CHEAPO while allowing a bunch of easy overlap plays. I would guess AEZ is better to keep than ACEZ and so play CHEEP probably, since the E seems easy to use and maybe I can take advantage of CHEEPY*.

#note Maybe better to play ERA/ER because of the S hook. Played this because I thought I might get a challenge, maybe that was a bad judgment.
