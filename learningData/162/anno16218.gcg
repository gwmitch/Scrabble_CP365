>Shannon_Burns: DUW 8G WUD +14 14
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ERSTTU 9B TURTlES +66 66
#note Surprised I didn't find (U)nTRUEST... which is best by far, this is a distant second.
>Shannon_Burns: ACEGOU D6 COU.AGE +22 36
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEFIIS 10G DEIFIES +79 145
#note I've always been extremely lucky when playing Shannon.
>Shannon_Burns: EEFINNT M4 FENNIE.T +63 99
#note I did hold, I didn't even know FENNY.
>Matthew_Larocque: ALNORST 8L L.ON +15 160
#note Ugly miss, exposing my lack of review with high probability bingos. I did waste a lot of time here too. 7F LORAN for 24 sims a hair better than L(I)ON, I didn't know LORAN.
>Shannon_Burns: GIOY L1 YOGI +34 133
>Matthew_Larocque: AEERSTW 13D SWEATER +73 233
#note Forturnately I get another bingo right away.
>Shannon_Burns: AEIOPRV I1 OVERPAI. +66 199
>Matthew_Larocque: BDHILLM 14F HM +32 265
#note Flopped between this and 1H plays. M(O)LD(Y) leads with H(O)LL(Y) second. HM is about 6th. I should have figured he'd take the spot next turn, but I was also trying to kill off the X-bombs.
>Shannon_Burns: EJN 1G JE.N +33 232
>Matthew_Larocque: BDHIILL 1L .ILL +21 286
#note I didn't really like keeping both ells, but the sim isn't going for it. I sure as heck didn't know (C)HILI(A)D though. 
>Shannon_Burns: AANQ B5 QANA. +16 248
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCDHII A6 BAH +45 331
#note Keeping the high pointers worked out well.
>Shannon_Burns: EX J5 EX +54 302
#note Wonder if he already had the X and figured QANA(T) would ensure he still gets to cash his X in next turn?
>Matthew_Larocque: CDIIMRY 15G ICY +29 360
#note This is the rack I wrote down - but it can't be right becauase I looked for plays like CRIM(PE)D and there was nothing that worked. Maybe I had a P instead of an M, but then I miss (AM)P plays which seems silly (and a couple of bingos I didn't know). The rack of CIIIMRY makes sense, but that also doesn't seem right because I was looking for 2x2s.
>Shannon_Burns: LO H6 LO... +17 319
>Matthew_Larocque: DIIMPRV 12F PRIM +30 390
#note IMPI or PRIMI C2 are good plays too, and they obstruct bingos.
>Shannon_Burns: U 6L U. +2 321
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDIOOV 2E AVO +23 413
#note N11 OVOID valuates much higher, but in terms of winning % it's really close between 4-5 plays. I think Quackle prefers turnover plays here, but after that 2 point play Shannon surely has the blank.
>Shannon_Burns: AG 3G GA. +19 340
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDINTZ O6 NA. +3 416
#note Wasn't sure what to play off to block here. If I actually do get the blank, I'll have A1 BlITZ, BORTZ is another possibility. Sims says forget about that and just score points now. I suppose dropping as many points as I am here isn't worth it. 
>Shannon_Burns: KORST 1A STORK +36 376
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDIOTZ K9 B.Z +28 444
#note Wow, the blank actually was in the bag. I miss many better plays because no time left.
>Shannon_Burns: DER 12A DER. +7 383
>Shannon_Burns:  (?DIOT) +10 393
#note 3 early bingos kind of allows some breathing room, I didn't even win by that much due to some questionable choices.
