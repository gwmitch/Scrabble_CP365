>Linda_Wancel: GO H6 GO.. +6 26
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDIRW 6F WI. +15 36
#note Don't remember my last tile but I think I should play BAW(L) or something. I know I had an S or a T.
>Linda_Wancel: DEINRTU E4 UNTRIED +74 100
>Joshua_Sokol: ABDERST D9 DABSTER +78 114
>Linda_Wancel: BDU 15B BU.D +7 107

>Linda_Wancel: EV 13B VE. +12 119
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKPRT M9 KRAIT +34 172
#note I thought everything else gave back too much. Not sure I knew T(U)PIK this early.
>Linda_Wancel: JT 4D J.T +20 139
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEIPY 11K YE. +24 196
#note I didn't know MOORY though. That sucks...
>Linda_Wancel: AF C10 FA +16 155
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIILP -AAIILP +0 196
#note I didn't want to open anything at all, as she seemed to be keeping strong leaves, but that may be me overestimating her skill level. I have trouble figuring out what lower-rated players are up to when they play 2 at a time. I think F9 LEI is a good idea. I wanted to go for the blanks. I think exchanging everything is also decent as there are 7 E's in the pool.
>Linda_Wancel: GNO F9 NOG +20 175
>Joshua_Sokol: EELLNRY G2 LYE +21 217
#note I think I considered giving (BURD)ENER a try. It's good. This didn't look too terrible considering there's already a floating T. Actually, I wrote down BURDENLY on my scoresheet, not BURDENER. BURDENLY is phony.
>Linda_Wancel: N 11B N.. +5 180
>Joshua_Sokol: ELNNPQR -LNPQ +0 217
#note Unfortunate draw here. Maybe I should keep EPR.
>Linda_Wancel: ?AGINSS 2G .ASSoING +70 250
#note There it is...
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRRS 11K ...R +7 224
#note I figured she needed an N to realistically capitalize on this play.
>Linda_Wancel: AINP 1H PAIN +35 285
#note She had it, but didn't deem it necessary to block a fishing play such as YEAR.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIINRS 13F RAINIES. +60 284
#note I spent so long here. Play and learn, I learned this game that SENARII was very difficult to find unless you recognized the alphagram. That's 25% more winning chances thrown in the garbage.
>Linda_Wancel: AE 11F .AE +4 289
#note hmm, this does seem like a decent blocking play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEOQRU N6 ORCA +14 298
#note Scared of the blank I guess? I don't think I'm supposed to be, even after she played AE for 4.
>Linda_Wancel: AM 1N AM +15 304
>Joshua_Sokol: EOOPQUV M2 .OPE +12 310
#note I literally had no idea what to do here. I took forever. I think I should exchange them all. I was afraid she could score with (PAIN)T/TI__ or something.
>Linda_Wancel: CE 4K CE. +14 318
>Joshua_Sokol: IILOQUV 5B LIO. +13 323
#note I think I need to play (S)UQ and hope for the best.
>Linda_Wancel: FZ J12 F.Z +35 353
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HIQUVW B2 QUI.l +26 349
#note I missed (FIZ)z, and Linda thought I lost because of that, but QUIz loses if she plays the endgame correctly. I literally had no time left. The only win is 14M sUQ.
>Linda_Wancel: EEELTT H11 .L.TE +18 371
#note wrong but she wins anyway
>Joshua_Sokol: HVW 3B .H +10 359
>Linda_Wancel: EET N1 ..EE +15 386
#note -4
>Joshua_Sokol: VW 6N .W +5 364
>Linda_Wancel: T 15H .T +2 388
#note -9. She didn't see 1H (PAIN)T after all.
>Linda_Wancel:  (V) +8 396
#note Boy, what an upset. Linda was now my biggest upsetter.
