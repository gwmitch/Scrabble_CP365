#note I challenged.  I was confusing this word with another high-prob phony.  GAPIEST* maybe.

#note Fortunately, Bruce doesn't challenge.  I was told (by another player looking at the board after the game) that CORVIN* was phony.  Also note that I had a D and could play the legitimate CORVID.

#note Whatever.  I need spread.  BE GREEDY!!!  But if I wanna fish, this isn't the right way to do it.  Not only am I blocking row 1, but I'm giving up a vowel.  The pool has plenty of vowels, but I'm only fishing off two tiles.   I should have played ELM instead.  Yeah, this play is bad.
