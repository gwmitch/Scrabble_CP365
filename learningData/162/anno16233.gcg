#note Turn two and I've already missed a bingo. I didn't know CETOLOGY.
>Vera_Bigall: AMY 7G MAY +24 75
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEELTT 9G TEE +14 64
#note Maybe I should play ELECTEE despite the danger it causes.
>Vera_Bigall: AHR 6H RAH +23 98
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHLOPT E10 HOE +28 92
#note EPO(C)H looks good here, even though I want to get a _____RATE word.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?BLSTVW -BVW +0 170
#note Not sure how big of a deal my exchange not being the best static exchange is. I should actually play BL(E)W though.
>Vera_Bigall: EISV 1E VISE +30 167
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALRSST N1 ARTLeSS +79 249
#note I didn't know if LASTERS was a word. She didn't challenge the phony CENTUPLET*.
>Vera_Bigall: AEILNSU O7 INULASE +76 243
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DGJNRR 1M J.G +33 282
#note I didn't think R(A)J was better. Boy was I wrong. I think the 8% difference in the sim has to be significant.
>Vera_Bigall: BEEF C10 FEEB +37 280
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADNRRR -RR +0 282
#note I guess I9 (E)RR.
>Vera_Bigall: AX 2I AX +52 332
#note Knew this was coming, couldn't really prevent it.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ADNORU M7 pANDOUR +68 350
#note Only thing I saw, horribly enough. At least it's at the top of the sim.
>Vera_Bigall: NOW L10 OWN +24 356
>Joshua_Sokol: IKORTUV 8K OV. +10 360
#note Things are looking pretty shabby unfortunately. My play was bad and I knew it. I'm supposed to play K9 ORT even though the leave is horrendous.
>Vera_Bigall: IM 10I MI +10 366
>Joshua_Sokol: DIKRTTU 11H RUT +10 370
#note I considered N12 TURK but it gave back way too much. I knew this was bad though... I'm making really bad pre-endgame plays with low time.

>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIKLT 15F DI.TLIKE +68 438
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIIKLT --  -68 370
#note There's only one win and it's the less plausible LIKE word, TID(E)LIKE, rather than DI(R)TLIKE*. I thought it was the most likely to be good and I couldn't find anything that won.

#note My time ran out in a tournament game for the first time since the BAT last year. I lost 20 points.
