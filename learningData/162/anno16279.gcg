#note Kolton (who's cool as hell by the way) doesn't challenge but he knew it was phony.  He didn't challenge because he had a nice play on row 15, hooking the E to make CORVINE.  I'm averaging about 4 bimbo moments a tourney.   I must have forgot CORVIN* was phony despite playing the exact same word TWO ROUNDS BEFORE!!!  COVIN sims slightly better than my phony.

#note Quackle recommends that I play on the lower left side of the board with something like DIGIT or TIGHT.  I saw all those plays, but I ignored them as they do nothing but screw me over.  I need to keep lanes open, not close them.  I thought of exchanging (keeping IT), but exchanging just makes it easier for Kolton.  I played PHI to score and to open another lane.  The timing is off because I'll definitely be exchanging next turn, but I can probably still make something happen.

#note I considered playing a lower-scoring bingo (OUTSIDER and TOLUIDES are the ones I was thinking about), but 86 points is just too many points to pass on.  Besides, it's best that I use this spot than somebody else.

#note The other plays I thought of were VINA and VIVE.  I mistracked and thought there was a U out.  (When Kolton played DUTEOUS, I for some reason thought one of the Us was a blank).  I didn't play VINA because I thought he could play VAULTY afterwards.  I was clapping myself on the back when I pulled the F out of the bag.  If I were to ignore all the one tile plays Q recommends, VINA is the play that gives me the highest winning percentage.  Tracking correctly is important.
