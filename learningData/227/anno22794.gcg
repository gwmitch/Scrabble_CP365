>Jonathan_Lindh: AACEGSU 8D GUACA +20 20
#note Cold Weather: Hot Scrabble: Jon Goes On A Tear! Part 5: PHONY! 8F AGUE is the best valid play which I saw but I figured I gamble. Tim didn't even hold.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ABEPT E8 .PBEAT +20 20
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEENNS I2 ENNEAdS +66 86
#note I should just do 14c ENSNARE for 69 which I saw. I didn't like how much ENSNARE gave back so I pluralized my own phony. Just do ENSNARE and save yourself the nervousness. -3.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ADZ D10 ADZ +55 75
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILPRW F12 PAWL +33 119
#note 4th best play! PAW is better in this spot apparently. 13A WIRETAP for 44 is insane and best! -9.3.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ORRY 15F .ORRY +24 99
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIILMOR 14J MILER +39 158
#note 3rd best play! I disagree Quackle. MOILER isn't that much better than MILER and much more dangerous. -9.1 to Quackle but I would do mine again.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: BSTU O12 BUST +35 134
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADINOOT 3B DONATIO. +70 228
#note 2nd best play! I don't see the best 3G DONATION. My play may be better but Q says -2.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DEENNTT 2H D.TENTE +23 157
#note This was Tim's actual rack. 6F TENANTED was his only bingo for 63. This was 5th best. Costly error.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFGHOO A1 COOF +49 277
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFGHOO --  -49 228
#note COHOG JON! I confused this phony with the valid OZONATION. I shouldn't be making these kind of errors.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AIIN 1E INIA +24 181
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEFGHOO L12 GO.F +24 252
#note Still COHOG. 5th best play! -12.2
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?DEERTU L1 U.REnTED +72 253
#note 2nd best play for Tim! 5E nEUTERED was the 2x2 for 82.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEEHOY 5E ECHO.Y +28 280
#note 10th best play! I saw 2B EYE which is Quackle's best and went with ECHOEY for turnover and try and bait a challenge. EYE gives a lot back. -7.9
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: FILLMVW -FILL +0 253
#note Well this worked because Tim has to exchange.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEGIMSV 2A VIG +23 303
#note 5th best play! 13C METAGE is great. My play is better than VEG because there are 4 I's out! Quackle says -6.9 to METAGE but mine is just fine.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EJOQVWX M6 OX +36 289
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEFHKMS K7 HEMES +36 339
#note 8th best play! KEEFS in same spot keeping HM. I agree Quackle but this is still pretty good. -8.7.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ILO J10 OIL +11 300
>Jonathan_Lindh: FIJKLVW 13K L.W +24 363
#note Best play!
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AIIN N9 INIA +10 310
>Jonathan_Lindh: FIJKRRV O7 KIF +35 398
#note Best play! Was INIA the right call?
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EOQSU O2 SUQ +31 341
#note 2nd best play for Tim because I hold JRRV. 10A SQUAB for 36 is his best play! -5 for him.
>Jonathan_Lindh: JRRV 13E ..J +18 416
#note Best play! Great endgame for me.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EO N5 OE +9 350
#note 2nd best play for Tim! 4C OE is 12. -3 for Tim.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr:  (RRV) +12 362
#note Another well played game. About 59.1 lost equity although MILER and VIG were initentional equity losses. I need to COHOG and KEEFS but those were only moderate mistakes.
