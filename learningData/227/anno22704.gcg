>Jonathan_Lindh: DEELNRT 8G LENT +8 8
#note 12th best play! I saw LEND which is what I would have done after I hit my clock. -2.1 and you'll see why this is bad.
>David: EV J6 VE. +14 14
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDEEORT 9F RODE +16 24
#note -5.3. DOTED keeping ER at K7 is apparently best. I think this is OK.
>David: INW 10I WIN +14 28
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?DEIOPT L8 PrOTEID +81 105
#note Shoot! This at E5 is 92 and best. Another 2x2 miss but this ended up working. -11
>David: DGNNORT -  +0 28
#note David challenges! I thought he might! Now he is about to get hosed because I know the hooks for this!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEHLPR 15G PLAsHER +97 202
#note Best play! Also sPHERAL HARELIP and RALPHEd.
>David: DGNNORT -  +0 28
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIIRTU 8L .URI +18 220
#note 3rd best play! PTUI in same spot is a little better. -2.

>David: BGINSSU K10 .UB +18 46
#note Actual rack! 11C BUSINGS is what he should have done. He had BUSSING or BUSINGS when he played my bingos. Ouch! 8th best play for him.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEIMOTU N6 MU.A +12 232
#note I was trying to block here. Should have seen 14J IODATE. -15.
>David: EFGINSS E8 FESSING +78 124
#note Best play for David!
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIIOOST D7 OI +9 241
#note 3rd best play! O1 OTIOSE is Quackle's fave but blows up the rack. Fishing I feel is best. -1.8 but I do again.
>David: CDEGIN C3 CEDING +32 156
>Jonathan_Lindh: EHIOSTW B6 HO +29 270
#note 3rd best play! Not terrible but 14B WEIGH for 40 a bit better. -8.1.
>David: ITZ 10B ZIT. +33 189
>Jonathan_Lindh: EILRSTW 12D W.LT +14 284
#note I had no clue what to do here. 4A LWEI? -9 apparently but this is ok.
>David: AEY H11 AYE +25 214
#note This is NOT ok. Of course this is phony but a bad challenge is the only way I lose.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEFIRRS B10 .ARFS +34 318
#note 2nd best play! 4A FAERIE is best by 2.4 but my play scores the most and doesn't open anything. I do my play again.
>David: OTU A13 OUT +16 230
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGIILRY O2 RILEY +16 334
#note ooph! GIRLIE A1. This was a mistake. -15.6
>David: AX N2 AX +31 261
>Jonathan_Lindh: DGIJKOV A4 JIG +26 360
#note 4th best is this accurate! 7I KEG is best. Mine is -4.7
>David: AAEEORS 4A .E.R +22 283
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEKMNOV 1J VENOM +23 383
#note Best play!
>David: AET C13 TEA +21 304
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABDKNOS E2 BOSK +32 415
#note It's hard to analyze this endgame. Mine was tied for second best behind KNOBS, BONKS and BANKS. However, I wasn't sure on PLASHERS. WOuld he have been Q AND C stuck? I don't know. This seemed ok.
>David: AACOQ 14L .OC +14 318
#note This tied for best with J12 OCAS.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADN F1 DAN +14 429
#note Oops. 11A NADAS for 15 or F1 DAN for 14. This is 3rd best. -3. I'll call my endgame -4.
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (AAQ) +24 453
#note Fairly good game. ABout -80 in lost equity but some of it was on blocks which Quackle doesn't register that well. No missed bingos!
