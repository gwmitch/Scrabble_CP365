#note There's 4 winning plays here and despite being a bit low on time, I manage to miss all of them (which all involve playing RECHOSEN at some stage):
>Akkarapol: ACLT 3K ACT +13 385
#note He's got a ton of wins here but is very low on time and I think my AERO play kinda threw him off a bit (he probably wasn't expecting me to play something so idiotic)
>Naween: IPU 6M PIU +11 383
#note So apart from not seeing RECHOSEN and blowing the endgame, I'm fairly happy with my overall play in the opening round. FWIW - Adam Logan did spend a minute after the game as well and didn't see a win - which makes me wonder if RECHOSEN was indeed available....I mean how do you miss that???

#note Forgot that BURGH and BRUGH were both good.
