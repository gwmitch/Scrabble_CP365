#note Maybe he missed B(HAJI)! Dunno what his other tiles were.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEINPS J9 EPEE +22 50
#note I took a while here. Fishing off the E didn't seem fortuitous enough to merit the points sacrifice. Indeed it only bingos with 31/86 tiles left unseen, so 36% of the time plus the letters Michael may give me to play through. So I decided, "you know what, screw these E's".
>Michael: EMOW G4 MEOW +26 53
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFILNS 11B FINALES +85 135
#note 4D FLA(M)INES, if I knew it, may have gotten me a free turn! Plural of FLAMEN, neat.

#note Baby, let me show you my bingos.

>Michael: AGLRXY --  -69 141
#note Michael was unsure if this was the new word. It definitely merited trying.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEINTZ 6J Z.NED +39 317
#note Emanuel and Jason were blabbering and crowding my board to say how well I draw, and Emanuel let the whole world know I had a blank. I guess that's the Montreal club for you guys if you ever come and visit! No filter, nothing like sanctioned tournaments! This unfortunately caused me to lose focus and not actually block Michael's X very well as I intended to do. Good thing it didn't matter. K5 (ATOMISE)D is a great play here, as is L10 DITZ. This, not as much, but still OK.
>Michael: AGLRXY 4J G.LAXY +42 183
#note It ended up being fine, as Michael wasn't going to use the spot I gave him anyway.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?IINTUU -IUU +0 317
#note I guess I should just play through with L10 TUI, since it scores and blocks.

#note 8A OURE(B)I is nice. Missed it. But playing short has its merits given the tile pool, so this may have been correct. Who knows.
>Michael: CQ C10 C..Q +30 273
#note there is that Q I was half hoping for.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIRTUU F11 .UAU +6 425
#note Considered (CINQ)UE, (L)UAU and U(L)U here. I wanted to block a lot of stuff, but keeping the A is great for flexibility and I might even be giving him a bingo hooking a blank S to LUAUS. (CINQ)UE is also fine as a play that forces Michael's hand after an already forced play. Forced plays are the plays that can pretty reliably telegraph unbalanced racks. Some of the time CINQ holds well, but an overwhelming majority of the time, unseen tiles aside, it does not. So CINQUE it is, just keep scoring! :)

I would play ULU in a do-over for spread purposes.

#note But this, this, was definitely not supposed to happen. 
>Michael: DILNRTU G10 L.ND +16 320
#note -12 to the tough M1 D(I)L(A)T(E)R. Michael mistracked, otherwise he would have blocked my best spot with 7K (M)UD.
