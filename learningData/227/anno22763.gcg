#note He put down DONG first, so I assumed ANS with an R or T or maybe D or higher tile like CMP. 
>Jackson_Smylie: ABDDERS 15H BREADS +40 123
#note also considered ARDEBS for 3 more, which definitely might be better... but I really liked what this did to the board (even though the A isn't friendly to the S), I was fairly sure UPONS*.

#note considered UNJAM, but with this lead I'm happy with VUM - if he bingoes I can either bingo back for more or triple triple (if he plays at G1 perhaps), and this forces him to open where I can pounce.

>Jackson_Smylie: EIRRSTU L4 RUSTIER +73 336
#note thought about sultrier, which opens a couple scoring spots which is favourable to me. rustier opens up a C and T hook but closes plays on the 5 row like KAF and such which can be hard to deal with (although I do have 5e). I didn't see a big difference in what each did to the board shape for bingoes - after sultrier any bingoes (except those hooking neonates) will give a lot of scores back, but then rustier scores more and gives the T hook and leaves B and C open. Q says matt bingoes about 2% more after rustier. I'm also up 200 after this play so all of this thinking is basically moot.

#note I considered ENTIA to take out the rustier hooks, which also seems okay cause there are only 2 Es left. I prefer that a bit in retrospect, or maybe exchanging down to just EN, cause I don't see a huge use for the A here.

#note keeping az seemed better here, and having an E at 5d for z plays.
