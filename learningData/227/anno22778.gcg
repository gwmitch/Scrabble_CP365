#note Very close to a bingo at 12a but not quite. Turning out to be a very frustrating game where he seemingly has all the answers.
>Weibin: AEU M10 AUE +12 345
#note I couldn't work out what this play meant. Maybe he was trying to set up a big Z, Q or J play.

#note This kind of epitomises how I was running. My best play is JOW for 39 - but that guarantees him a bingo most of the time. I can't even effectively take out the tripe file at a1.

So basically the game ended with some more spread for Weibin but at least I managed to not give away another bingo.
