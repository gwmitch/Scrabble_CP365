>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIOTT -EO +0 0
#note I had my moments of amazing drawing in this game, but this is mostly Jason drawing horribly badly.
>Jason: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 0
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEITTV 8D VITTlED +78 78
>Jason: AEOR 7G AERO +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: EGLNQRW 6J GREW +21 99
#note Do I drop my Q now? Do I exchange?
>Jason: AEEIR K1 AERIE. +12 28
>Joshua_Sokol: ILNNNPQ 2J P.NNI +26 125
#note I didn't know PINN(A)L, but at least this sets up my Q with an I draw. I had this doubt about if PENNI took anything, though, and it does. Not only does it take an S, it takes an A! Lucky Jason didn't capitalize, probably because he didn't realize either. Big mistake.
>Jason: AAE 3J A.EA +18 46
>Joshua_Sokol: EFLNOOQ 4G LOON.E +25 150
>Jason: AEILLO D6 AL.EOLI +20 66
>Joshua_Sokol: AFGKQRU 6B QU.RK +48 198
#note This play is only correct because of the other huge spot on the board neither of us knew about... I should play QU(A)G otherwise to be safe. I'm already way ahead, no need to let him back in it.
>Jason: IPTY E10 PITY +28 94
#note Yes, I will pity you once this game is over.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAFGISU B6 .UAG +14 212
#note Missed SAIGA, which is far more sane. This was completely insane, but I trusted my intuition! I missed I7 (RE)FUGIA which is the dump I was looking for. Anyways, you cannot believe what happened next.
>Jason: UX 1N XU +36 130
#note At least that annoying uncertainty was gone. Yes, it was unlikely he had the A, I think probably around 1/4 times or less, but I'm not good with that sort of math, but look at what I drew.
>Joshua_Sokol: AFFHISZ A8 HAFIZ +108 320
#note As I announced my score as 108, Jason inquired "that's it?". :(
>Jason: DLOR H1 DRO.L +18 148
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEFISY C12 FAY +24 344
#note Aargh! I doubted FACIES. Didn't seem like it made sense as a word. It's a dead 6 that I must have remembered from somewhere. Bleh. At this point I'm just playing for spread.
>Jason: BIMSTU 15C SUBMIT +43 191
#note Wow! He had an S!
>Joshua_Sokol: CEINSTV A1 EVICTS +61 405
#note I would have played INVECTS* 14H against some people, but not against Jason...
>Jason: BIMNORW 14H IMBROWN +92 283
#note See, it could have been worse, Jason! c:)
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENOST 13M AE +16 421
#note I figured I might lose to something like JOUNCES + a good endgame. Boring, I know.
>Jason: HJOS 12K JOSH +40 323
#note Second time my name was played at club that night.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DENOST G6 S..iN +24 445
#note I almost attempted UNSORTED/PENNIN, but PENNIN looked horrible over the board, so I decided I was making it up for sure. But wow, K11 f(J)O(R)D setting up DENTS is hella cool. Wish I would have seen that! This is 19 points off.

>Jason: CDEGN L11 C.G.N +13 336
#note -4 to blocking VOTED with 3A (I)CED.
