>Jonathan_Lindh: CEGLORS J7 G.L +7 107
#note 6th best play! CELORS is the preferred leave but my fish is fine. -5.1 to the duck but I'd do it again.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: FG L2 G.F +24 48
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEINORS 10D RECOINS +74 181
#note 2nd best play! Arrgh! Look for the 2x2 Jon! E5 INCLOSER is best although my play has some merit based on shutting down the board. -16

>Jonathan_Lindh: ACFHIOR 12D CHOIR +38 219

#note 2nd best play! 5H AEON for 17  keeping 3 E's is somehow better. -1.1
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: ARTZ 14I TZAR +35 111
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEEOOU 15G OBA +18 259
#note 5H AEON for 17. I was being defensive. -9

>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGKLT G2 TE.K +25 478
#note Quackle is stupid and thinks I can bingo. I can't. Look at the board. This is the best of the non-fishes and best.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: INOR N5 IRON +15 292
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ADGLM M5 GAM +24 502
#note Best play according to Quackle but in reality 2nd best. Tack the blank on as an A for one extra point because Tim is going out. -1.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.: EOS 13B OES +12 304
#note Best play and only out for Tim.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr.:  (?DL) +6 310
#note About -65-70 lost equity some of it unintentional. Lost about -4.5 equity per turn this game with over half it came on the INCLOSER miss and OSIERED. Well played game overall.
