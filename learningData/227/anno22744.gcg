#note Marldoom game from February of 1997.  ACBot was the actual opponent.

#note Just getting warmed up, folks.
>ACBot: DEEIIQX 4L Q.ID +32 165
#note Glad that QI was invalid at this time.
>Joey: ADILTVY 1H VALID.TY +203 332
#note If this game actually counted, Mr. Landsberg might have been getting a little antsy at this point.
>ACBot: AEEIMRX 10A EXAMI.ER +83 248
#note "Truly a fine play", for the sixth time time already this game.
>Joey: ?ABEEOP 9A BOP +30 362
#note ABO is obviously better here.  POSEABLE was still 17 years away from acceptability.

>Joey: ?ABEEFW 11D EF +24 386
#note I had forgotten all about this game until I remembered that this where I first learned WEBFED, but that isn't the best play. BAW(BE)E is.

#note Usually a game is unwinnable when one player has 332 after 3 plays. Technically that remains true....
>Joey: ?AEMOTT C2 TA. +20 493
#note Missing several rather pedestrian bingos by today's standards. The good news is that I could draw TWOSOME if I draw OW. But then he (it?) would have TERRAIN and I would instead say OW!

#note For the record, had I found TOMENTA last turn, it would have been a 601-576 final. To see how I avenged this loss, change the 22744 to 3180.
