#note I also considered G8 DOJO. But it just gives up so much and accomplishes so little. Quackle sim is giving an edge to G5 LOID for the small chance I get to cash JO. It's pretty damn clever and I wish I had seen it.

#note Jesus we aren't gonna have any vowels for the endgame
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CDDEINV 3F VEND. +12 231
#note No idea what to do this turn. But VENDU is not correct. B8 COVE at least accomplishes something by blocking a precious vowel Lloyd may need to play through very soon. I should have done that for sure.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CCDFINO 10A OF +26 257
#note The pool is now 4 vowels 18 consonants. I can totally catch up to Lloyd if he's got drek. This is going to be a messy finish.
>Lloyd_Mills: AEEMRST 14I STEAMER +74 322
#note This shocked me. I'm not easily shocked.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CCDINSW 15L WIN +25 282
#note I could not see any way to win here. I'm setting up the K, Y, D, G, and S and hoping to draw the A (the last vowel) so that I can cash it in. Of course, Lloyd will obviously have G(EN) at the very least o crush this plan. It will maybe work if his rack is BDHKLQN or something. The other option is CWMS which I should have spent more time considering. It hopes to draw the A and maybe the K or something to score points through the R. It also protects the E from easy blocks. If Lloyd doesn't have the A, H, or the Y, the R is mostly unblockable after CWMS. I can then score there and Q stick him to catch up. It's a long shot, but probably more likely than whatever WIN hopes to accomplish.
