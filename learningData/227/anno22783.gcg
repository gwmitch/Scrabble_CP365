>Ella: ILMO H6 MOIL +12 12
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGKMRU G5 pUGMARK +82 82
#note Was relieved this still played! Find the 2 and 3-letter steals for PUGMARK!
>Ella: DOR -  +0 12
#note Challenged, of course. No one in their right mind wouldn't unless they knew it. No one at club knew this word, amazingly, as Emanuel and/or Jason usually have a very good combined word knowledge, Jason of all the higher probs and Emanuel of the more obscure words.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEENS -EEE +0 82
#note Seemed like a good time to exchange, but 11E EE(K), obviously. Missed it!
>Ella: DOR 11D DOR. +18 30
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGHNNS 12C NAH +23 105
#note Missed a 5 I didn't know in SANGH H11. Probably the play there, but it'S close. Didn't like the inflexibility of HE or HA at F6.
>Ella: IIPR I9 PIRI +17 47
>Ella: IIPR --  -17 30

>Joshua_Sokol: AENNOOS 14A NOO +15 150
#note I'm crazy. But you already knew that.
>Ella: AEY F6 YEA +39 84
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIINSU -UII +0 150
#note USNEA. :/ I saw UNAI a second too late, it's worth playing at 11I. And EINS is significantly better than EINS in general, which makes the difference in this position, despite the A being a better tile for the board than the I.

>Ella: EJT H12 JET. +19 132
>Joshua_Sokol: CDELRUV 13G V.LURED +32 264
#note Honorable mention to 13G D(E)CURVE. That's better than this :(
>Ella: EO K11 .E.O +13 145
>Joshua_Sokol: ACFGHTV L12 F.H +33 297
#note ugh, stupid miss of H(E)FT. Once again Jason and Emanuel had been distracting me from the background saying I drew well. They even agreed I had just drawn well after VELURED. I sort of got frustrated and basically told them that if they thought this was a good draw, they were idiots.
>Ella: IIIII -IIIII +0 145
>Joshua_Sokol: ACCGSTV J6 VACS +23 320
#note Now this S draw was really lucky. Goodbye board.
>Ella: EIOOT 8J .OOTIE +27 172
>Joshua_Sokol: CDGIRTT 7L GIT +13 333
#note meh
>Ella: EE 6J .EE +10 182
>Joshua_Sokol: ACDENRT N7 ..C +5 338
#note Should be going for spread but I am too tempted by completely closed boards.
>Ella: EW K4 EW. +12 194
#note Well, I guess -E(E) or -S(E) bingos are still possible. She should play WE(E) instead.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADENNRT J13 .N +12 350

>Joshua_Sokol: ADELNRT M1 LANED +24 374
#note I knew this was phony. I'm mean.
>Ella: IPY J2 YIP +22 232
>Joshua_Sokol: BIILQRT 3I Q. +21 395
#note Whew, no Q stick for me.
>Ella: AW 1M .AW +18 250
#note Lucky she didn't have IXIA to overlap LANED!
>Joshua_Sokol: ABIILRT N1 .B +24 419
>Ella: EX 6N EX +19 269
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIILRT 15J Is +17 436
#note What a one-tile draw... I guess my clubmates were right!.. Here I just decided to stick myself and complicate the endgame. Silly, but I am doing it for Ella, so she can learn, right? Right?
>Ella: DEIRSU O4 DE. +13 282
#note Not realizing I set up ISSUED. Lucky she missed it too
>Joshua_Sokol: AILRT 14F AI. +15 451
#note -7 to something that doesn't stick me as much. (VIE keeping the A, duh)
>Ella: IRSU 8E R... +6 288
>Joshua_Sokol: LRT -  +0 451
>Ella: ISU 10M US +13 301
#note -15 to F6 (YEA)S, ending the game in a double stick
>Joshua_Sokol: LRT 10L L..T +4 455
#note -5 to UT! Didn't realize I could do that. No excuses! Cool endgame...
>Ella: I O10 .I +2 303
