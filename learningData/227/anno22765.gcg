#note hue, huic, adieu, something else? thoughts? am liking hue more now.
>Matt_Canik: AAGIOPR J6 A.AGIO +12 259
#note it's hard to assume too much about my racks right now, though I'm pretty keeping more balanced than not. APORIA is nicer for outrunning but it opens up more. 
>Jackson_Smylie: AEEENQS F9 QA. +14 250
>Matt_Canik: EILPRTX 11J .XLIP +28 287
#note depending on how he thinks I'm holding, something like XI could work, or PLEX up top, and what the game plan is.
>Jackson_Smylie: CDEEENS O11 SCENE +45 295
#note CENSED to reach for the blank perhaps. I think he has the blank after OXLIP, although am definitely not 100%. CENSED is nice also to stop 8J plays. 
>Matt_Canik: BDEIORT L8 TRI.OBED +78 365
>Jackson_Smylie: DEIILOR F1 ODI. +11 306
#note not too happy with this play but also not happy with much. Perhaps I play TOIL or something but I want to keep as much open as possible... ODIC doesn't do much now but perhaps I can open the top next turn. I want to keep my E.
>Matt_Canik: AEFLNNO 15F FENLAN. +33 398
#note F(I)NALE for 38 is pretty sweet. fenland opens up a scary z bomb.
>Jackson_Smylie: EFGILOR 14J FO. +29 335
#note couldn't see a reasonable way to hit the Z then bingo.
