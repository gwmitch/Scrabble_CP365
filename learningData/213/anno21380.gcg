>Reid: AFHINOT H4 FAITH +30 30
#note #1 play using 5 min Championship Player.
>Greg: AGRZ 5G G.ZAR +30 30
#note ZAG at I3 is better.
>Reid: CHNNOOU J4 N.CHO +16 46
#note This one stumped me. CAHOUN at J4 is #1 (50.95%) accomplishes what I was trying to do. Dump the double letters and the U while eliminating the triple letter.
>Greg: DENPS L1 PENDS +38 68
#note Nice to have esses so early.
>Reid: AANOOUU 1L .AUA +18 64
#note Quackle thinks an exchange should be made here. In hindsight, I agree. Exchanging AOOUU (31.39%) or ANOOUU (31.27%) or AAOOUU (31.08%) are the top 3 choices. My play is #4 (30.98%). I don't think this a a huge mistake but exchanging may have grabbed a blank or an ess.
>Greg: AX K7 AX +23 91
>Reid: BNOORUW 7A BROWNOU. +65 129
#note #1 play here. Almost missed this one because I wasn't really looking for a bingo with this rack. I was proud of myself for a minute until Greg made his next play.
>Greg: GIINRSU A7 .RUISING +86 177
#note Damn. This one hurt.
>Reid: EGMMPRR 2K P.RM +26 155
#note #1 play here.
>Greg: CILOSTY 11A .YSTOLIC +76 253
>Reid: EEGLMQR G10 Q. +11 166
#note Qi is #5 (3.35%). It's not good when Quackle thinks two of your last 3 plays should have been exchanges. Exchanging EGLMQ (3.796%) and EGLQ (3.69%) are #1 and #2. MERGER at B2 is tied for #1. Exchanging EGMQ is #3 (3.52%). CREME is #4 (3.49%). Im okay with my play here, didn't want to exchange with the huge current spread. Leave is not great, my play is certainly not horrible. I do think Quackle's playing choices are good for score and tile turnover.
>Greg: ?ADEIOT L7 gODETIA +82 335
#note TOADIED and TOADIES score 83. Game is pretty much over at this point.
>Reid: EEEGLMR H11 .REME +30 196
#note GLEEMEN at E1 is #1 (0.36%). I can only imagine that this is due to tile turnover and volatile positioning. MEAGRE and GLEAMER at 13J and 13I are #2 (0.27%) and #3 (0.2%) likely for the same reasons. My play is #7 (0.14%)
>Greg: BEY G13 BEY +27 362
#note Greg just needs to lock up the board now.
>Reid: EGLNOVW 13K V.W +18 214
#note WOVEN at E3 is #1 (0.08%). While this balances and scores well, it takes out a nice lane in E. WOVE at F6 is #2 (0.07%). This balances well but uses the E. However, there are plenty of E, so I shouldn't have been so worried. LONG at M10 is #3 (0.06%). This is okay for points but seems horrible for leave. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #9 based on valuations of all plays. While it's obvious, it creates lanes and hope. WOVE may sim better, but my play doesn't feel all that bad.
>Greg: EL I3 LE. +19 381
#note With a play like this, Greg likely has the S. He doesn't have the last blank at this point. This is a balance and score nicely play.
>Reid: EEGLNOV I13 GEN +25 239
#note GEN is #6 (0.05%). EVE at 14M (0.29%), DOVE at 9L (0.22%), and VOE at F6 (0.12%) are the top 3 respectively. I think Quackle is sucking dregs here with EVE and DOVE. These plays will be easily blocked. I like VOE. I went for more points rather than a better leave though.
>Greg: AIKR D11 .RAIK +28 409
#note Padding the lead. He certainly doesn't seem too concerned about the S hook on VAW.
>Reid: EELOOTV 10J VO. +14 253
#note I think this game has broken Quackle. OE at K10  and SOLO at C11 are tied for #1 (0.13%). TOOL and TOO at 6C, ELEVON at E2, OVOLO at C3, OOT at 6D are all tied for #2 (0.07%). There are no other plays that can possibly win. My play is not in the top 15 but is #21 based on valuations of all possible plays.
>Greg: EJ F6 J.E +26 435
>Reid: EELLOTT C9 LO.EL +18 271
#note DOLT at 4L (0.07%) and ET and 6B are the only possible winning simulations here. LOTTER at B2 is #3 based on valuations of 5 min championship player. My play is #4.
>Greg: DEFISTU N8 FEUDIST +86 521
>Reid: ADEINTT O3 TAINTED +95 366
#note #1 play obviously. Greg has 500+ and he doesn't even have to use both blanks. Turn was scored as 85 instead of 95.
>Reid:  (?AEIO) +8 374
#note Game was officially scored incorrectly as 511-365. No missed bingos. 7 of 12 plays are in the top 5. 9 of 12 are in the top 7. Other than NACHO, I really don't see any obvious mistakes. VAW and VOE are not glaring errors. Not passing worked out because I was able to bingo with BROWNOUT. Overall,l I give myself an B+ this game.
