#note Reid comments: GUV or VUG at 8G are top 2 (67.08%, 66.58%). GUV at 8H is #3 (66.13%). My play is #8 (62.78%). Quackle preferes balancing to points to open. With my blank, its probably the better choice. Medium size mistake here.

>Matt_Canik:  (E) +2 475
#note This game was incorrectly scored officially has 475-419.
The missed bingo and challenged phony lost this game. Other than that, a suboptimal opening is the only real mistake. 11 of my 13 plays are in the top 4. 12 in the top 8. Overall, I give myself a B-/C+ this game.

Matt missed a bingo. 12 and possibly 13 of his 14 plays are in the top 6. I give him a B+.
