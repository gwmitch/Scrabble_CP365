#note I thought about OVULAR, but the board seemed nice and open for potential bingos.
>Bruce_Ward: CEEITT 5E TEC.ITE +36 186
#note I challenged! only TEKTITE was familiar. also, he blocked GORDITAS, so I should challenge if I'm like 25% unsure or more given expected value.

>JD: EEIMNOS 13K O.E. +14 310
#note quackle suggests scoring more points with MENO at O10. the bag is not great, so EIMNS is not a lock to bingo - and the pool is quite heavy on consonants, so EIS is less bad than usual.
>Bruce_Ward: ABR J11 BAR +18 335
>JD: EGIKMNS 14G GINK +39 349
#note this move didn't give me much of a chance to win. alternative plays that are better are KI  at 14J which doesn't open the triple and fishing with YOK at I9. I think YOK may be the best chance I have, a play like BAR for so few points suggests a bingoish leave.
>Bruce_Ward: ACDOS 15F CODAS +49 384
#note I lose
>JD: EMOQRSW 13D MOWER +20 369
#note I thought that maybe I could still win if bruce mistracks or does something ridiculous and I draw the U or blank to go out with SUQ. for pure spread quackle suggest MORSE at 13C.
>Bruce_Ward: ?DENPSU 12C DUP +24 408
#note at least I blocked SPURNED. Best is the cute SNEAP at 4B for 60.
>JD: AQS E11 A.. +10 379
>Bruce_Ward: ?ENS O9 aNES +16 424
#note he should slow-play me by starting with VEXES.
