#note DONG is also reasonable, but I thought not really since I hate the G and I thought the challenge potential existed and I needed a different, less S-based board.

#note I thought there was a chance he had the S, even though he would've had UNISONS.  He could also draw that or an overlap, and it's probably better against Sal anyway.

#note Going all in here.  I don't see a reason to keep gambling, and if I close the lower right quadrant Sal's not going to be able to play out of it.  This seems like the best option for reducing bingos while still giving me options if things go wrong.

#note All of my options are terrible.  I need to distract him from column o somehow, and this seems like a reasonable option.
