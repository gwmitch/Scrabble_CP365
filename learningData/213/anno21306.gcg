#note Great start!  I saw this and figured that, coming off his 5-tile exchange, I was going to be off to the races

#note E3 COOEEING scores 68 but this is a beautiful find!  And it had an unexpected benefit:
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEEIT -  +0 40
#note Redefining the extent of human stupidity.  Instead of noticing that his play floated the N I needed for DETAINEE, I chose to fixate on his word.  Since CONENOSE looked like something I should have seen in study by now, I challenged and cost myself the game.  The rest of this deteriorated pretty quickly as you'll soon see.  Bingoing back wins 54%; being a moron and challenging a word I have no reason to challenge wins 28.  Nothing like throwing away 24% winning chances and 58 equity points with a perfectly avoidable decision.

#note Yes, I saw REWOVEN as a threat, but there were only 2 N's unseen and I didn't like the idea of keeping AEIOU? and exchanging on the next turn. This is another stupid play by me in a game full of them.

#note Not that I've played worth a damn to this point, but it's a sign of how this game was going that he floated me the Z and I had to just watch it dangle there.  Obviously I need to do something about row 1 and SCUDO looks a little better to leave myself a hook.  That said, no matter how I slice it, it's beyond bleak.  1.3% to win.
