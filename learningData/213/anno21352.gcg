#note Club tournament 7/29/2015. I came late, so I had to play two doubles. Two games at once, twice. My first two were against Michael and Ella, and this time it was Michael and Emanuel. I had a lot of spread, and I was 2-0. Michael, Emanuel and Jason were all 2-1, and I had a lot of spread, so I figured I should just focus on one of my two games, the one I was drawing better in, to give myself the best chance! Turns out, this was that game.

#note Given my time pressure (50 minutes for two games), I felt like I should keep the board open to make my decisions easier, and I shouldn't waste time looking for bingos that are usually better for my winning chances. I get stuck thinking hard on closed boards, so I preferred keeping things open.

#note I don't know what this was. It was an attempt to control the board and make my S valuable if Emanuel tries to open things up further. But it wasn't a good play.

#note of note: 8A ENTI(T)LE(D) for 43! I didn't think he could even win with a 3x3, so I decided against playing 1B ZEIN, which I saw. Although given the likelihood of him hitting a 3x3, I should make the play anyway.
