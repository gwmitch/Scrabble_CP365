#note Cesar's Comments: -3 shoulda kept BEL.

Reid's Comments: Exchanging HJKV is#1 (46.70%). Exchanging BHJV is #2 (45.28%). Exchanging HJV is #3 (45.27%). Cesar's play is #11 (44.67%). 
>Reid: ADINNNR H7 NAN +6 6
#note The beautiful NANDIN at 8G 8H or 8D takes the top 3 (50.65%, 50.56%, 50.47%). My play is #10 (47.98%). This is a medium sized mistake. I completely agree with Quackle here. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEEEHNT I6 DEE +10 10
#note Cesar's Comments: DENE is exactly what i was looking for. this type of situation is very important. G7 EH or G8 HE would be fine too. i don't know what really gets to me when i make moves like DEE, but i was aware that it was probably wrong. I think that while I'm in the game, something like EH or HE vs DEE/THEE just seem close enough to a wash. -5.5

Reid's Comments: HE at G8 is #1 (49.98%). EH at G7 is #2 (49.91%). HE at I8 is #3 (49.87%). DEE is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #18 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Reid: DGINRRV -DRV +0 6
#note GRIND at 9E is #1 (46.77%). NERVING at 7H is #2 (46.58%). #3 is VIRGAE at 8D (46.26%). My play is #6 (45.99%). The win % difference is so small that this is a minor mistake at most. I like VIRGAE best.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DEEHNTU G8 HUED +18 28
#note Cesar's Comments: maybe HE. not a fan of just G8 HUE. however, maybe? don't know what to put him on. also considered 9G UNDE. This one is a bit closer but i'm still bleeding equity on little and important play like this. the first person to bingo is always favored to win so when opponent opens short, exchanges 3, etc it seems important to take the extra time to make the right play. I think by the end of this play I had already spent like 7+ minutes. -2.5

Reid's Comments: HUE is #1 (55.33%), TENDU and HUNTED at 9F are next two (55.05%, 54.17%). Cesar's play is #6 (53.87%). Small mistake at most. 
>Reid: AEGINNR J8 NEARING +71 77
#note ENGRAIN at J7 is #1 (63.71%). GRANNIE at F9 is #2 (62.98%). My play is tied for #1. Saw ENGRAIN but missed the hook. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEFLNST F10 FELT +31 59
#note FEN and FET are #1 (39.83%) and #2 (38.88%). Cesar's play is #3 (38.73%)
>Reid: ACIMORY 13B COMI.Y +34 111
#note MORAY and ORACY at 14B are top 2 (74.81%, 74.64%). CORY at 14C is #3 (68.51%). My play is #6 (67.22%). I wasn't sure about FELTY. This is a medium sized mistake at the least. I had been proud of this play until now. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEENRSY D10 ENE.Y +20 79
#note Cesar's Comments: kind of sad about this error. I was pretty sure I was going to try FELTY, then i somehow forgot about it? i wasn't 100% sure of it, but I really was going to try it (it's new, and i did sort of remember feltier/fertile) and then once COMITY came down I started thinking that i was already down by a bingo, and lost track of my thought, then said "oh cool, ENEMY". -12.5. something i will have to work on...

Reid's Comments: YE, YER, and YEN are top 3 (39.34%, 38.29%, 38.27%). Cesar's play is #9 (32.56%)
>Reid: AAIRRSW J2 WIRRA +23 134
#note #1 play.
>Cesar_Del_Solar: EEEQRSW K5 EWE +23 102
#note Cesar's Comments: -2 QI. considered it to fish. this board is already hideous and i'm down a bingo.

Reid's Comments: QI at 3I is #1 (27.26%). EEW at K4 is #3 (26.63%). Cesar's play is #2 (26.68%). Cesar has a tough choice here, he can sacrifice points or plug up the board with QI. It's a minor mistake at most because the rack is so tough anyway. 
>Reid: AHJPSTX B10 PAT.H +36 170
#note PAX or TAX at I1 are top 2 (81.42%, 80.15%). PAX at L3 is #3 (79.11%). My play is #4 (78.96%). I figured I couldn't bingo the next turn anyway, so I thought I'd save my X for some cheap points next turn. This is a small mistake, but I'm okay with my play here. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ACEQRSV L1 VARECS +43 145
#note #1 play.
>Reid: ?AJLOSX I1 LAX +40 210
#note My gamble from last play paid off and my spots are still available. JAILS at 12H is #1 (93.20%). LOX is #2 (92.89%). OX at I2 is #3 (91.96%). My play is #4 (91.66%). I considered LOX, but wanted to keep my O for a hook at A10 using the J. This is a small mistake at most. I didn't want to use my ess, so I didn't even consider #1. I specifically didn't want to make a play like #3 and and give Cesar an easy triple. I like my play here and I disagree with Quackle. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: IIIILQV I12 QI +26 171
#note Cesar's Comments: i deserve it due to bad play earlier, but it is pretty frustrating to be debating so hard between QI, VAREC, VARECS to almost catch me up, and then he drops down LAX for 40 pts in three seconds and I draw 4 i's. quackle likes C9 QI better for some reason, but i need as many good lanes as possible.

Reid's Comments: QI at C9 is best (8.16%). Exchanging IIIIQLV is #2 (7.51%). Cesar's play is #3 (7.19%). I agree with Cesar's placement, but exchanging might be worth the gamble at this point with all the I. 
>Reid: ?AEJORS 1F JAR. +33 243
#note #1 play.

#note #1 play. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: DIILOOS N1 .OID +16 217
#note Cesar's Comments: or viol, w/e?

Reid's Comments: OI at C9 is #1 (0.74%). IDOL at A8 is #2 (0.73%). DILDO at E2 is #3 (0.60%). Cesar's play is #5 (0.59%). I disagree with Quackle here, I think Cesar made the best choice here. There are more hooks to the D than the L and VOID scores more than VIOL. The game really is unwinnable at this point without a triple triple soon. 
>Reid: BLNSTTZ D1 Z.ST +46 370
#note #1 play.

Cesar's Comments: holy toledo
>Cesar_Del_Solar: AILOSTU O4 OUTSAIL +78 295
#note Quackle likes OUTSAIL at 5A better. (1.00%). Cesar's choice is (0.67%). I like Cesar's choice here better too. 
>Reid: BILNRTU A8 BRUT +24 394
#note BOTULIN at B1 is #1 (99.87%). INBUILT at 13J is #2 (99.47%). TURBIT at A2 is #3 (99.42%). I was trying to block a triple triple because the blank was out. I don't think my play was that bad. My play is not in the top 15 of 5 min champ, but it is #1 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?EFMOOU A14 OF +20 315
#note #1 play here. Cesar's win percentage has skyrocketed to (17.83%). 
>Reid: GIIKLNO 13I ..KLING +24 418
#note GINGKO or GINKGO at 14J are top 2. BILK at 8A is #3. All top 15 choices win the game. My play is not in top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #24 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Cesar_Del_Solar: ?BEGMOU L8 GrUMB.E +26 341
#note Cesar's Comments: ew. also, i should block his higher scoring out with B4 iMBUE. -3

Reid's Comments: Cesar's play is #2. MOSEY at 3B is #3.
>Reid: IOP B6 POI +15 433
#note PISO at 3B is #1. TOPI at A2 is #3. My choice is #2. 
>Reid:  (O) +2 435
#note No missed bingos here. 8 of 13 plays in the top 4. 11 of 13 plays in the top 10. Overall,  I give myself a B+ this game.

Cesar had some tough vowel heavy racks but played great. No big mistakes. 8 of 13 plays in the top 3. 11 of 13 plays in the top 9. Overall, I think Cesar gets an A- here.
