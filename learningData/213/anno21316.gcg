>JD: ACEHIRV J6 VI. +15 15
#note not having a spot for ARCHIVE was a tough start to this one.
>Jerry_Lerman: AADEFKT I7 K.EAD +27 93
#note quackle likes KAIF at 7H here, keeping a good leave and not opening the triple.
>JD: ACEEHOR H11 OCHER +42 57
#note another non-go to start the game! HOE actually sims slightly better.

>JD: ADEGILS G1 GLADIES. +62 119
>Jerry_Lerman: AEENRUV 1C AVEN.E +42 213
#note probably tack on the R for the 3 extra points?
>JD: AIIRTWX 10H T.XI +38 157
#note I really liked creating this S hook for potential future use
>Jerry_Lerman: CEHNPRU 5B PUNCH.ER +80 293
#note ouch!
>JD: AINRUWY 14B UN.AY +32 189
#note win chances are down to 1.5%

>JD: EIINRUW 13G W.INIER +36 225
>Jerry_Lerman: AEILRRZ L12 Z.AL +28 347
#note jerry liked ZEAL to block the R lane, but plays like RAZER or AZURE also block useful lanes for me. RAZER sims about 5 better (he's still the heavy favorite)
>JD: ?ADOOPU L4 APODOUs +81 306
#note it ain't over yet!
>Jerry_Lerman: EEILORR 15J RO.LIE +18 365
#note quackle suggests ROLLIE at 2E to block another bingo lane, and also not give back the E to bingo to (though that lane will be deceptively hard to use)
>JD: DEIJSTU 10B JU. +26 332
#note need to get quite lucky...
>Jerry_Lerman: AELMNRT 3C MENT.L +16 381
#note my moment of good fortunate. he ran low on time and missed MATERNAL!
>JD: DEIOQST M3 QI +24 356
#note QUOD at 9K seemed easier to block.
>Jerry_Lerman: ABEFGRY M6 FEY +24 405
#note FAY at M6 wins every endgame. FEY wins 35/36...
>JD: BDEIOST N2 BIDET +43 399
#note whoa, I have a chance!
>Jerry_Lerman: AABGRT O1 BA +16 421
#note jerry has a tying play!
>JD: OS E10 SO +19 418
#note if jerry wasn't under time pressure he would see ABUT at bottom-left - but instead he didn't notice I had JUTS/SO, and so he tried to block at top-right. what a surprising comeback!
