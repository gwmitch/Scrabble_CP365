>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ABFRSS 8G BARF +18 18
#note One of my best played games! 9th best play. Quackle likes 8D BARF more but I chose the leave of SS? and ability to hook onto BARF. I didn't see BARFI at the time though...
>Lisa_Odom: EITY K5 YETI +24 24
#note There's that BARFI hook. No biggie!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?ALNSSZ 6F LAZiN.SS +70 88
#note 3rd best play? But only bingo? Quackle likes passing on the bingo with 6J ZEALS for 36 points. I like playing the bingo! 
>Lisa_Odom: ORUVW M1 VROUW. +24 48
>Jonathan_Lindh: FILPRRS 4L P.RR +14 102
#note 12th best play! Quackle likes 4L FURL for 16 and 2J FLIRS for 32 much more. I just wanted to balance my rack.
>Lisa_Odom: MOU 1L O.UM +30 78
>Jonathan_Lindh: AFIIJLS 2J FAI.S +38 140
#note Best play! Here's where my dominating streak starts.
>Lisa_Odom: IO 9G OI +10 88
>Jonathan_Lindh: BEEHIJL 1G JIBE +44 184
#note Best play!

>Lisa_Odom: ?DEEINN O4 .EpINNED +74 162
#note 2nd best play for Lisa. Raise your hand if you saw E4 ENGINED and GLAZINESS for 80 points. GLAZINESS? Pretty advanced stuff.
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEEHLUY N10 HEY +33 217
#note Best play! Tied with YEH in same spot for equity of 33.9 points.
>Lisa_Odom: ACDEP M11 PACED +31 193
>Jonathan_Lindh: CELORTU 15F CLOTURE. +86 303
#note Best play! Lisa briefly held this, and then played...
>Lisa_Odom: INX 14H NIX +55 248
#note I hate being X bombed after a great bingo. Fortunately for me...
>Jonathan_Lindh: ADDEEIT 10D IDEATED +73 376
#note Best play! Seeing a pattern?
>Lisa_Odom: EGHLNST 3D LENGTHS +73 321
#note Best play for Lisa! I don't think this fits if she did ENGINED and GLAZINESS.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EIKMOVW L10 WOK +47 423
#note Best play! I think this was the nail in the coffin.
>Lisa_Odom: AGNOU 2B GUANO +24 345
#note What a strangely appropiate word for Lisa given how well I'm drawing and playing.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIMOTV K11 MO +39 462
#note 2nd best play! How did I miss K11 MOVER in the same spot for 62 points? I'm not sure I lost that much spread in the end, if any though. MOVER would have emptied the bag too. Lisa had the Q at this point as well.
>Lisa_Odom: Q 7N Q. +11 356
>Jonathan_Lindh: AAEIITV 4A VITAE +33 495
#note 2nd best play! 4A AVIATE is better by an equity of 21.4 to 19.8 despite scoring 1 point less. AVIATE also avoids VOLTAGE which comes next while still scoring the same.
>Lisa_Odom: AEGLORT A4 .OLTAGE +33 389
#note Best play for Lisa! Tied with VORLAGE in same spot. Should have done AVIATE which I didn't see. However, I don't track in club games anyway. And not so good in tournament games either.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AI 8M AI. +14 509
#note Best play! One of my best games all year! And still room for improvement. 7 out of 12 best plays. 2 out of 12 2nd best plays. 1 out of 12 3rd best plays (LAZINESS only bingo, I'd do it again). Several of the equity slips I don't regreat doing either because of the position and the leave. This was crazy!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (R) +2 511
