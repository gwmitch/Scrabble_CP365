>Jim_Burlant: ACEEFMR 5I F.AME +20 44
#note I saw CAVER 4H but didn't like the EFM leave.  I couldn't find anything else that unloaded the F, so I put this down.  The sim indicates this is one of my 3 best plays.  The other two are 4H FEVER (best, wins 56%, I never thought of it) and 5I CLEF.  This wins 53% and sims nearly 7 points down.
>Orry_Swift: BDEIK N1 BIKED +36 60
>Jim_Burlant: BCEILRT 1K BRI.E +30 74
#note This turn drove me crazy, as I searched in vain for the 8 through the A that I couldn't find (there is none).  Statically this play comes down to 9F LIB or 3K BILK.  Evaluating this I chickened out on BIBE (was 50/50 on it) and felt that for 30 pts it would be better to clear more of the rack since I was unloading both my vowels.  The duck thinks I should worry a little more about rack building than points here:  the sim winner, which I rejected due to score, was L2 CLIMB.  This wins 2% less often and sims 3-1/2 points down on CLIMB.
>Orry_Swift: IIW 3L WI.I +22 82
>Jim_Burlant: CDILMTU 9D TUMID +24 98
#note You're kidding me - TALMUD* and TALMUDS* are phony, but TALMUDIC is good?  If you miss the bingo as I did the play is one of the 5's along row 9, and this is as good as any of them.  TALMUDIC wins 70%; this wins 49.
>Orry_Swift: AFIOOOP 10B FOO +16 98
#note Actual rack.  These tiles score 8 more at 2J, but his main concern was shutting down 8A.  
>Jim_Burlant: CDLNTYY E8 D.LY +23 121
#note Yikes!  Best is apparently 10B FOOTY for 36, which I never saw.  Makes sense - besides the extra scoreboard points, it keeps the L to go with the other Y.  This is best of the rest.
>Orry_Swift: AIJNOPT 2J JO +29 127
#note Actual rack.  This was an interesting position for Orry, as he gave strong consideration to ADAPTION to set up his J for the next turn.  And with 2 blanks unseen, it gives him that much more turnover.  But this is best.  
>Jim_Burlant: CDNSUXY 6J .XY +29 150
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  ONYX clears one more consonant out of the clunk and scores 3 more.  
>Orry_Swift: AEINPST 11D P.A +13 140
>Jim_Burlant: CDENSTU 12A DUCE +30 180
#note I chose this instead of CUDS because, with 8 E's still unseen I figured I would be a shoo-in to land one.  As for the sim:  this was the best play available that I was capable of making.  That said, ADDUCENT, which I didn't know, scores 45 at H10.
>Orry_Swift: AEEINRT 12F ARENITE +68 208
>Jim_Burlant: NNOSSST A12 .ONS +15 195
#note Saw this and put this down on autopilot to prevent easy plays like DAZE. The best equity play is one that makes sense against Quackle but I have reservations about it against a human opponent:  SONS 10G.  If I had this to do again, SON 10G might be the play since, leave notwithstanding, playing off 2 S's like that tips a little too much off to Orry.
>Orry_Swift: UZ C12 .UZ +28 236
>Jim_Burlant: ENOOSST 10G SOONEST +75 270
#note I finally get one right.  The M7 placement scores 1 more but gives back way too many easy plays at L8.  This keeps things more or less shut down.  64% to win.
>Orry_Swift: AI 14A .A.I +26 262
>Jim_Burlant: EGNNPRT H12 .RNE +12 282
#note While it was possible that Orry was merely clawing for points on a dead board, it was weighing on me that both of us had spent so many turns playing off garbage that almost all that was unseen were bingo-prone combinations, especially with both blanks at large.  Defense against easy row 15 7's was the priority, which is why I rejected plays like PENT and GENT K9 that top a sim.  I considered TEN 15D bt thought it likely to give back an easy 7 that I might not be able to underlap.  I rationalized this, feeling that the E would be easier for him to play through than extend, and if he had an 8, he had an 8, that's life.  In retrospect, TEN looks an awful lot better:
>Orry_Swift: ?CELORW 15G W.LCOmER +62 324
#note If you're Orry, do you bingo or not?  Orry was very reluctant to put this down, and for good reason.  If I have the blank to go with otherwise unbalanced garbage like AAAGUV, this will lose the game for him.  But the rest of his options are just as dangerous and they don't score well, so he has to take the points.
>Jim_Burlant: AGINPTT 14M PAT +18 300
#note Nice rack...but not for this board. :-(  Best is apparently 13H RATING 25, but it wouldn't have mattered:
>Orry_Swift: ?AEEGL O9 EAGLE.s +60 384
#note And if I play RATING, he still has EAGLEs for 57.  At this point I mentally checked out and just started moving tiles to end the game.
