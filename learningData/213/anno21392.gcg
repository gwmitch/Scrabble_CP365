>Sal_Piro: ENTW 8G WENT +14 14
>Reid: GINNTUU J6 TU.U +6 6
#note Missed UNTUNING at I2 and other places. During the game I was whining inside about my double U to start. TUTU is #8 based on valuations of all plays. Huge mistake to start.
>Sal_Piro: ENOVW K3 WOVEN +26 40
>Reid: EFGINNN L2 FEN +21 27
#note #1 play. 
>Sal_Piro: BCIPU K9 PUBIC +26 66
>Reid: EGINNQR 12J Q. +11 38
#note My play is #2 (36.17%). CINQ is #1 (38.71%) and I missed it even though I'm famiiiar with the new word. Exchanging NQ, which I considered, is #3 (33.16%). This would turn out to be another mistake even though I accepted the inherent risk.
>Sal_Piro: EORSS L8 ROSES +47 113
#note OS at L11 has a better valuation here, but Sal said that he had three esses in his rack at this point so he decided to use both and it blocked my bingo.
>Reid: EGINNOR M3 NEGRO +29 67
>Reid: EGINNOR --  -29 38
#note NO and NOG are #1 (24.28%) and #2 (22.76%). RENO at M1 has save win%. WEN at 3K is #3 (21.79%). I was so focused on my missed bingo I carelessly played one of the most well known invalid words. As soon as Sal said hold, I took it off in disgust.
>Sal_Piro: ABD M1 DAB +33 146
>Reid: EGINNOR 8L .ING +15 53
#note ON at 7G (9.98%) and ON at 9G (9.71%) are #2 and #3 respectively. DON at 1M is #1 (10.09%). The synergy of REIGN is just too strong. I was aiming to open up the board. My play is not in top 15 of 5 min champ sim. My play is #35 based on valuations of all plays. Another mistake.
>Sal_Piro: AEFG N6 GA.EF +21 167
#note With a comfortable lead, Sal can afford to block up lanes and scores nicely here.
>Reid: EEIMNOR O1 MERINO +30 83
#note MERINO is #3 (6.39%). ERMINE at O10 is #1 (7.43%). DOM at 1M is #2 (6.46%) . I didn't even see ERMINE. I still like my play and this is not a big mistake.I was hoping for turnover and to pull a blank.
>Sal_Piro: ST 11K ..TS +16 183
#note Sal has so many esses he can afford to use them to block. An early lead and a tight board will give you that luxury.
>Reid: AAEJRTX 9G EX +25 108
#note REX at N2 is #1 (13.76%). ATE and ARE at N1 are #2 (10.33%) and #3 (10.04%). I completely missed WEBER. Missing this play is a huge mistake because it was a momentum shift. My winning percentage actually went up here. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #14 based on valuations of all plays.
>Sal_Piro: EL 7G EL +20 203
>Reid: AAAEEJT N1 AT +24 132
#note My play is #3 (4.53%). ATE at N1 (8.2%) and TEA at N2 (6.99%) are the top 2 respectively. Missing WEBER is the mistake that keeps on hurting.
>Sal_Piro: AEIOSTZ F1 AZOTISE +91 294
>Reid: ?AAEEJR 1F .JAR +33 165
#note AJI at 5D is #1 (1.41%). RAJA at F9 and AJAR at 10D are #2 (1.34%) and #3 (1.33%). This is Quackle in a fever dream of winning. My play is #9 (0.65%). I disagree w/ Quackle. I don't think this is a huge mistake even if I knew I was going to lose at this point.The leave aint pretty but there aren't many E left in bag.
>Sal_Piro: DIY G3 YID +25 319
#note Sal closes some more lanes.
>Reid: ?AEEHMR E5 HAREEMs +114 279
#note #1 play. I incorrectly scored it as 107.
>Sal_Piro: ADIOR D8 AROID +24 343
>Reid: DKOPRTY C11 POKY +33 312
#note Not getting a blank here pretty much ends the game, but it was fun getting close.  POKY is #3 (13.33%). DORKY at C11 is #1 (14.57%) and KA at 7M is a surprising #2 (13.60%). I'm guessing these percentages would be a lot lower if Quackle knew that my opponent had the blank.
>Sal_Piro: ?AAEILO C2 AEOLIAn +66 409
>Reid: DGILRTV D1 GIRD +26 338
#note VLOG at 4A, DRY at 14A and YIRD at 14C are top 3. While VLOG looks attractive, giving my opponent a fat triple at the end doesn't. I knew my choice was poor, but didn't care enough to worry about the endgame.  I like VIGAS at 6B, but I didn't see it. My play is not in top 15 of 5 min champ, but is #2 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Sal_Piro: CHILNOU 13H CHI. +26 435
#note Quackle likes ON at B14 better and LYNCH at 14B is the top score at 42. 
>Reid: LTV 4F ..LT +5 343
#note TOD at 12B, TA at 7M, and TI at 6B all have the same negative valuation. My play has has a much higher valuation when evaluating using all plays. Not sure why 5 min champ thinks other plays are better. I guess it thinks Sal is going to give me a place to play the V.
>Sal_Piro: LNOU H13 .ON +15 450
>Reid: V -  +0 343
>Sal_Piro: LU 15F LU. +3 453
>Sal_Piro:  (V) +8 461
#note The game was incorrectly scored as 459 to 348. This was a winnable game. Missing the initial bingo was devastating. Losing a challenge didn't help. No real end game. Missing CINQ early was bad. 6 of my 13 plays where in the top 3. 7 in the top 10. I give myself an F this game.
