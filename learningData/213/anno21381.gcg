>David: AEGMUZ 8D ZEUGMA +56 56
>Reid: EEELMOR 9H EME +19 19
#note Right word, wrong place. EME at 7H (28.64%) is #1. ZEE at D8 (28.19%) and MEZE at D6 (28.11%) are #2 and #3 respectively. My play is #4 (27.96%)
>David: HU 10I UH +31 87
#note Well, it could have been the X up top.
>Reid: AEILORR D4 ARRO. +28 47
#note My play is #2 (25.88%). ZORIL at D8 is #1 (26.52%). I saw ZAIRE (24.88%) but wanted to keep my E. I agree with Quackle here, ZORIL is better because it keeps E and at least one R.
>David: OPXY 5C P.OXY +34 121
>Reid: AEIILOS 6G AIOLI +12 59
#note My play is #3 (20.97%). OI is #2 (21.09%) and REI at 6D is #1 (22.58%). While REI has a worse leave, the point difference is certainly worth it. I agree with Quackle here, small error on my part. I was hoping to pull some tiles and get a blank. I had considered OI, but missed REI.
>David: AGW 5I WAG +27 148
#note David now has a comfortable lead.
>Reid: EEKLSST 11E KELTS +24 83
#note My play is #10 (17.48%). KELP at C2 is #1 (21.55%). KELTS and KEETS L1 are #2 (19.98%) and #3 (19.48%). KELP is more defensive. My KELTS is more conservative but I have to agree with Quackle that is worth the points to play at L1. It also would have blocked my opponent's first bingo. This was a big mistake.
>David: EHNNRSU L6 SHUNNER +78 226
#note Winning without getting blanks in the next few turns is likely impossible at this point.
>Reid: ADEEEOS E10 E.E +7 90
#note TOEA at H11 is #1 (2.22%). ADORE at 6A is #2 (2.12%). OE at 10F is #3 (2.07%). My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. I think TOEA is horrible. I think Quackle suffers when games are unlikely to be won. While TOEA creates volatility, it seems likely to be easily blocked. I like OE. I did not like my play here. It is #31 based on valuations of all possible plays. Obviously, I was trying to balance.
>David: IOQT 8K Q.OIT +42 268
#note Because of course.
>Reid: AAADEOS K11 AA +10 100
#note My play is #6 (0.2%). SOAPED at C2 is #1 (0.28%) due to points. I didn't even see it. ODEA at D12 (0.22%) is #5. Exchanging AAADO, AAO, AAAO, or AAA are all equal or better than ODEA. After being unjustly rewarded on my last balancing turn, I double down on stupid and try balancing again.
>David: DEFY N6 ED.FY +22 290
#note Not sure why David doesn't just play DEIFY. A good score and block of the bingo lanes.
>Reid: AADEOPS 4F APO +23 123
#note APOD (0.31%) at D12, ADORE (0.26%) at 6A, and OPA at 4F (0.21%) are top 3. Not sure why my play is not tied for #3. There is very little difference between the two. Based on valuations of all plays, it is tied for 2nd with OPA. There must be more hooks to the A than the O. I disagree with Quackle here. I think my play is okay.
>David: CEIW H11 .WICE +42 332
#note I feel like a fish in a barrel.
>Reid: ADEIORS 14E IDO.RASE +67 190
#note #1 play here.
>David: BR 10D R.B +21 353
>Reid: BCIJLNT 12B JIB. +26 216
#note JIBE is tied for #5 with many other plays (0.01%). CLINE and NIBLET at 12A are #1 (0.14%) and #2 (0.10%). JILT at O3 is #3 (0.05%). I have to agree with Quackle here. Top 2 plays, while having bad leaves, do open up board and increase turnover. Blanks are still out. My play is highest scoring of the 15 from 5 min champ. 
>David: EFV C11 F.VE +20 373
>Reid: CDDGLNT 7B CL.D +11 227
#note CLOD is tied for #2 with exchanges of CDGLT and DDGLT (0.07%). Exchanging DDGNT is #1 (0.13%) and CLAD at J12 is also #1. I'm having classic vowel whipsaw. Too many early and not enough late.
>David: ?INTTUV -?INT +0 373
#note David likely had a lot of vowels here.
>Reid: ?DGLNOT 15L DONG +29 256
#note #1 Play
>David: ?AEIORT 3H gOATIER +65 438
>Reid: ?IILNTV 15A VIrL +31 287
#note This is just sad. I saw INVITAL during the game but didn't see the hook until reviewing this game. I need to pay more attention to the blanks. My play is #3. VISIT is #2.
>David: NNSTTU 2J TUT +13 451
#note BES at F10 is better here because of points.
>Reid: INT O12 TIN. +6 293
#note My play is #2. TIAN at J12 is #1. I didn't see it.
>Reid:  (NNS) +6 299
#note Missing INVITAL was a huge mistake. Not passing in the middle of the game was probably not a good idea. Play was suboptimal early on, but not glaringly so. 9 or 10 of 13 plays were in the top 5. 11 or 12 were in the top 10. EKE was a bad play. While this game was likely unwinnable, I give myself a D+/C-
