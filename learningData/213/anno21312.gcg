>JD: AOORTTU 8G OUT +6 6
#note taking the points for OUTRO is better. the additional OR leave is not particularly good.

#note he blocked my bingo, which was fairly likely. many plays sim very close. this is reasonable.

#note failed to think of VIOL at N7 until after hitting my clock.
>XP: IQ 14I QI +28 130
>JD: EINOSVW 8M .OW +18 158
#note the EINSV leave is not worth sacrificing points to keep, should just take the points for VOWEL (which actually leads to me bingoing more).

#note elodea is a couple of extra points.

>JD: EIIOTTY 6C TI.Y +16 267
#note quackle suggests TOMMY or IOLITE as improvements - I strongly dislike what IOLITE does to the board, turning it into a permanent shootout. TOMMY looks good.
>XP: ACNR E10 NARC +14 229
>JD: EGIORST 7N GO +11 278
#note quackle loves turning over tiles on this play with the two blanks unseen. after GRIOT, my play the next turn is only 6 points worse on average than after GO. definitely GRIOT!

#note the question is, can XP win without drawing the E?
>JD: DENRSST G10 TRENDS +22 373
#note not the correct endgame since it gives big X play. key realization is that after his best play of EXEC, he can't actually go out in two, so I should start by slow-playing with OWTS at O7 and see what he does.

#note still good enough.
