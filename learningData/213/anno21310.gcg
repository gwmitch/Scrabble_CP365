#note I was really confused by this turn. Q wants me to play AA in a bunch of different places. Yuck. ANOA 5J is also simming well... ew.

#note WHIFF! VI(S)OR is a much better play here.
>Orry_Swift: ADEJNP 11A J.PAN +28 234
#note Orry first sets down J(A)PED, then J(A)PANED*, then plays this. Since he's holding ED, I think the odds of him drawing a big play along 14J are quite high next turn
>Matt_Canik: GINORSS N13 SIG +17 203
#note So I want to knock out possibilities there, right? 

Thinking about this later in the game, it may be better for me to play small and not block the spot, then anticipate counter-bingoing in the 15 row. But a small fish will give away a prone leave and scare him off the spot entirely... I don't know man.

#note My chances in this game seem to be going pretty fast. I want to point the board, but just don't have the tiles to do it. There are plenty of Ls left for row 5, and if I can draw 3 vowels on a rack then there's a real chance I can bingo in the 6 row or the M column, though none of those are extremely friendly lines.

Maybe I shouldn't open this spot up. A tell from Orry made me think he may have had a junk rack here. I was wrong.

>Matt_Canik: AIOORST 14F TOO +13 241
#note Maybe I can sell out hard for the bingo with OO(F), but I think Orry just counters for 40+ a lot and effectively ends the game. A play like A(G)O holds a more balanced leave, but I don't mind VVCC here because my bingo lines revolve around me having a bingo ending in a vowel.

#note I've got to open another line here and hope I pull something that plays along row 6 or row 3
>Orry_Swift: AH 14J HA. +29 345
>Matt_Canik: ?EFLQST L3 L.. +4 271
#note I think I'm sunk here. I played this to try to make Orry think I don't have the Q, freak out and set up a spot to play the Q, and then allow me to play the Q. It wasn't a good plan but nothing seemed like it was.
