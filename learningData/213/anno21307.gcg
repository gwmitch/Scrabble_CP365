>Matt_Canik: AELNORT H7 LO +4 4
#note Actual rack.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EMOOOU -OOOU +0 0
#note Exchanging is the correct call, though Q thinks I should have kept one of my O's.  The difference in the sim is negligible (exch OOOU wins 0.4% less often and sims 0.9 down on exch OOU).  Just shy of 57% to win.
>Matt_Canik: AADENRT G7 AD +10 14
#note Actual rack.  And Matt can't draw a bingo to AENRT.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEMPP I7 AMP +21 21
#note Are you kidding me? Both P's on a 4-tile pick from a full bag? This position had me stumped; I don't know why I couldn't think of PEP I7, which balances the rack better than anything else and outscores this by 4 points.  
>Matt_Canik: AX J9 AX +29 43
>Jim_Burlant: ?BBEEPW 11I WEB +26 47
#note Ok, ths is getting a little ridiculous.  Get rid of duplicated P's, then draw BBW on a 3-tile pick out of a nearly-full bag?  I may have whiffed on the previous turn, but there was no getting this one wrong.  The W and one of the B's absolutely have to go.  
>Matt_Canik: ADENRTV K3 VERDANT +77 120
>Jim_Burlant: ?BELOPS 12H POSaBLE +95 142
#note All sorts of bingo optoins:  POSEEABLE 4H, PueBLOS 12D, 12C POSaBLE...but this is best; this scores 95 and none of the others scores more than 88.  53% to win; more or less a crapshoot right now.
>Matt_Canik: ALNRTTY -ALNRTT +0 120
>Jim_Burlant: DDINSYZ 4H ZIN.S +48 190
#note Yeah the leave is garbage.  But 48 points is 48 points; none of my other options (DIZEN 4H,, 13G ZIN) scores more than 34.  The rack will have to wait.
>Matt_Canik: AEHR 3I HA.ER +43 163
>Jim_Burlant: ADDGIUY M7 GAUDI.Y +30 220
#note I love this play:  I unload an N-less G, a U, and a Y for 30 points.  It doesn't get better than that, and Q agrees.  This is best:  74% to win and my next rack will take that figure into the 90's. 
>Matt_Canik: AFLT G2 FLAT +23 186
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEEITU 13C aUDITEE +79 299
#note None of my other bingo options (DETInUE, ErUDITE 13B) scorer m ore than 70 while this scores 79.  This is best and it's just shy of 96% to win.
>Matt_Canik: AJT 2L TAJ +25 211
>Jim_Burlant: CEILORU E9 CLOU. +16 315
#note Statically this is towards the bottom of the list but it's a very respectable choice in a sim. I'm leading by 88 points with the blanks gone and this play kills the D column as well as anything on row 9.  The only bingo line it gives back is something from 10A for low 60's, which will give me counterplay down the A column.  Q says I mostly had the right idea, though I should have played CLOURED for 4 more. I can see that - it's not crucial for me to build a rack, and with 5 E's at large I've got a good shot at drawing another one.
>Matt_Canik: ENTTY 14A NETTY +31 242
>Jim_Burlant: CEFIRVW A12 VI.E +33 348
#note And if I play CLOURED, he doesn't get NETTY.  Reiterating a point - given my lead and this board, I'm not worried about rack building.  I want to defend and score, and this accomplishes that.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Matt_Canik: KR H12 ..RK +30 272
>Jim_Burlant: CFNORUW 15F WO. +10 358
#note I wasn't overly happy with this turn but was so preoccupied with defense that I just wanted to shut down row 15.  The better play would have been RUNOFF 2B for 40.
>Matt_Canik: HOO 11A OHO +14 286
>Jim_Burlant: ACFNRSU J2 F.. +14 372
#note More missed scoring.  I was just looking to not open anything up for him since row 2 didn't seem like a good line.  Better would have been 2B SCRUFF for 44 or 1H SNAFU for 32.   That said, the difference is merely equity here.  Everything wins at least 98% and change.
>Matt_Canik: IINO 9A IONI. +8 294
>Jim_Burlant: ACMNRSU A6 UNC. +18 390
#note At this point I got obsessed with a MAG(AZINES) extension.  I saw this and figured  I'd set up my just in case I didn't land one of the G's and I didn't see any playable bingoes in the pool.
