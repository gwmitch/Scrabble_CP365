#note should I play VERATRIN instead for one fewer point? I might be able to take advantage of the E hook. IRREDENTA is also possible.

#note i saw 2D FAQIR but it seemed super simple for her to score decently in row 1. this is a tough move. I should probably still do FAQIR, because if she scores in row 1 she'll open the board, plus CST is a better bingo leave. -1

#note i saw E11 FLIC but I have a sixth sense about these things, and I was pretty sure she had an S. i should have asked her, but I'd put a small amount of money on it. i should still risk it. -5
