>insidious: EHIORSX 8H OX +18 18
#note An amazing game against ISC's best bot, Nyx, which runs simulations. Many interesting strategic decisions this game. I will try to provide detailed commentary for both sides. This trumps Mack's recent game against Quackle easily :p jkjk :)

>Nyx: ADDENRT 7H TAD +17 17
#note For Nyx, playing short is definitely better than playing long here. But what to play? There's TAD, TED, DAD, and DA to consider. The only worthy long option is DATED 7f, since it's noticeably more defensive than DATED or DARNED/DARTED at 7h. However, I would rule DATED out because Nyx's main consideration should be to make things as tight as possible after my fish, yet hold a strong leave, to increase his chances of bingoing back should I bingo. I would also rule out 7h TED here, which actually almost sims best. This is because I average around 3 points fewer per turn with a random rack, probably because of (AX)E underlaps. However, I don't have a random rack; I have a bingo-prone rack the vast majority of the time after OX. And so, since I'm going to bingo around the same whether Nyx plays TED or TAD, there's absolutely no reason to hold ADNR instead of DENR, since Nyx needs to bingo in return. That leaves TAD, DAD, and DA. DA's main advantage 'seems' like it would force my bingos to open triple lanes; however, (AX)E bingos are a huge deterrent to that. DENRT is too consonant heavy and relies on me opening vowels, so it's unneccesary. This leaves TAD and DAD. I think this is just a matter of preference. TAD wins the sim and is around 0.5 better than DAD, without the inference. But even with the inference, it doesn't change much. I'm almost never having an O for (DAD)O, otherwise I would always play OXO (barring something like EOORSTX, then it would be close). So it's basically a matter of whether Nyx wants to gamble with ENRT, or play it safer with DENR, a leave that bingos only 2% less but holds the D for a little non-bingo insurance. I'd take TAD here, but I think DAD is fine too.
>insidious: CEHILRS 6I LI +19 37
#note For me, this wasn't too hard a decision, because I realized that LI is quite obviously better than something like LICH (LI keeps a dynamic bingo/scoring rack, gives back less). However, Quackle's second favorite is just LAX, which I didn't even consider. Quackle suggests that my bingo % is 64% after LAX to 49% after LI, but I'm not sure whether I buy that. I feel like Nyx can just easily dink and keep things tight after LAX, whereas perhaps his only scoring options after LI play from either 5j or 6k, further opening the board for me. So I'll take LI here.
>Nyx: DEENQRW -QW +0 17
#note Since exchanging is clearly better than playing, this position is more trivial than usual, since we are just comparing leaves and we don't have to worry about things like board shape or defense. So which is the best to keep? Nyx kept the intuitive leave. But, (!!) Quackle likes just exchanging Q the best! Nyx bingos 6% less, but averages the same score, implying that his bingos score more and his non-bingos score more too. I would still exchange QW here.
>insidious: CEHRSTU 8G C.. +12 49
#note A very unorthodox play by me! I eliminated plays like CUT and CRU, so the only things I considered were just C(OX) and 5j HUT, the 'standard' play. However, C(OX) is just the option I was looking for. Because, despite Nyx playing short and exchanging short, I'm still the big favorite to bingo starting in an S (With an N, O, T, or blank draw). And yet I'm taking away a lot of Nyx's bingos, and should Nyx bingo, a lot of draws will allow me to bingo back. Another advantage is if Nyx misses, and I hit, the whole top left quadrant will be shut down, facilitating my progress to win this game. Quackle reports that I actually bingo MORE with this play than after HUT. Honestly, after deep thought, I saw no point of HUT at all. There is no board consideration to it at all; it would just lead to a shootout, and all quadrants would be opened. Not something I want to do, considering I'm not even sacrificing my bingo %. I'll take C(OX). 
>Nyx: DDEENRR I6 ...ER +13 30
#note Nyx's LAXER doesn't even show up on static but wins the sim. This is because all of Nyx's other plays open the board (an advantage to my LI play). So Nyx just played this, limiting my bingo opportunities and limiting the score of my bingos, should I bingo. I would take LAXER too, but Nyx seems to be in trouble here, as I am now a lot closer to bingoing than he is.
>insidious: EHIRSTU -U +0 49
#note I missed hitting a bingo here. So what to do? The main options are -U, HUT or HI at 5J. My reasoning is the exact same as last turn, yet it's much more clear this turn- because I bingo 84% next turn after this play and only 61% after HI and 46% after HUT, both of which open options for Nyx also. So this should be best. I'm a huge believer in keeping lanes open that are beneficial to me more than my opponent, rather than just opening the board entirely. 
>Nyx: AADDENR 5J DA +11 41
#note Nyx's main question here is where should he play off the letters AD? There's 5j AD and DA to consider, k5 AD and g8 CAD. CAD actually knocks out a lot of random-rack bingos (through the R, presumably- I bingo 3% less with a random rack), but it lets a lot of high-prob bingo racks play, so I would eliminate CAD. Nyx's optimal strategy should be preventing my bingos and letting my bingos open the board for him, rather than increasing my bingo chances and hoping I miss, and having his bingos open the board for me. Therefore, it seems best to keep it tight, though counterintuitive. For this reason, I prefer 5j AD for 10 over 5j DA or k5 AD, since it keeps things slightly tighter.
>insidious: EHIPRST L3 HIPSTER +82 131
#note It's between this, or HIPSTER one space higher for 80. My main consideration should be which play allows Nyx to bingo less often. I really wasn't sure. It's really whether I think Nyx will bingo less often through the I of HIPSTER, or bingo with a 7 on the left side of HIPSTER, and also partially obstructing the R in LAXER. Quackle confirms my choice is more defensive, for what it's worth.
>Nyx: ADEEINR M3 ED +19 60
#note I don't understand this play at all. I would just play (H)E here, and it's very intuitive as well as reasonable, and Quackle likes that by a very wide margin.
>insidious: CINTUVZ 10G VI.TU +10 141
#note More unorthodox! I could play any one of the 37 point Z plays at the top right, but VIRTU completely annihilates the board, both short and long term. Quackle likes VIRTU and CENTU better than any of the Z plays, actually. After VIRTU, Nyx bingos WAY less than any other option. So it's actually not unorthodox. And not to mention that my leave is a lot more flexible than my leaves after any of the Z plays.
>Nyx: AEINNQR J10 .RANQ +34 94
#note Easy choice here.
>insidious: ACILNNZ K12 LAIN +19 160
#note An overreaction, or just right? ZIN for 37 is still there. Quackle says this is very close to ZIN without any inference, and this destroys the sim with any kind of S inference, so I'll take this.
>Nyx: EEGINRU 6L .UE +5 99
#note Surprisingly, Nyx really has no other choices here. Quackle likes (R)UE best, but SUE makes it harder for me to block.
>insidious: ACEFNOZ 8K F.AZE +51 211
#note A turn where I don't have to think finally arrives.
>Nyx: EGIMNOR N8 .EROING +38 137
#note Fishing is totally out of the question here. It's between this and MONGER, and I would take this.
>insidious: CGMNORU 2M MUG +18 229
#note This is the only play that keeps both a flexible leave and doesn't open anything- it shuts down miracle bingos to the E in FEAZE. I'll take this.
>Nyx: AEMOOST O12 TOOM +29 166
#note I'd take OGAM here, but I guess this is okay. Nyx was probably interested in flipping another tile.
>insidious: BCEENOR L12 BE +21 250
#note I considered BE and OBE, and went with BE to keep the more flexible leave (CEONR) to respond to Nyx's potential plays (CENR is the more standard, bingoey leave). But I missed NEB, which I think is best. CEOR is even more flexible than my leave, and flips an additional tile. 
>Nyx: AELSSTW O1 A.LETS +28 194
#note This is an easy choice to flip over as many tiles as possible, and keep SW for insurance since the board is un-bingo friendly at this point in time. Quackle also likes S(N)AW 15j, which only flips 3 tiles and keeps a bingo leave, so I think that's wrong.
>insidious: BCEENOR M11 BE +16 266
#note Happy I found this! Quackle likes OBE in the same spot a little better, but again, I wanted to keep a flexible leave rather than a bingoey leave.
>Nyx: ?DOSSWW 15J S.OW +23 217
#note Nothing else worth considering.
>insidious: CEENNOR 9K E.N. +14 280
#note Nothing else even close to this play, either.
>Nyx: ??ADISW N1 D.I +14 231
#note Interesting position! No play opes the board, barring something like VAW, which can be delayed, since I average 10-15 more after VAW (on an otherwise dead board) and it can too easily be shut down anyway. Nyx can always open from the V in a more subtle way if needed. So now the main decision is whether it should dump HIPSTERS for 22, or play DUI. I'd take DUI, since the case S is very valuable for the long term, even on a dead board and even with both blanks on his rack.
>insidious: ACENOOR M14 A. +9 289
#note I love this play! It keeps it tight and saves CORO(NAE) for next turn, to respond to a play like (C)A(V)E or (C)O(V)E. But should I just play CORONAE now? I didn't think so, because I thought Nyx was much less likely to have a scoring play starting from the I in VIRTU than with the R of CORONAE. And since Nyx has been slowly catching up, and will be behind by only 58 minus a turn after this play, limiting scoring is once again relevant. Quackle says Nyx averages 28 after CORONAE and only 13 after AGO! So I was right here. I can always play CORONAE next turn if need be :)
>Nyx: ??AFLSW H7 ..W.e +12 243
#note Awesome idea by Nyx! I'd play this over HIPSTERS. TOWIE sets up all the case letters for him and gives me NOTHING in response (I only average 10 ppt). But it burns a blank. Still worth it, I think. I'd take this.
>insidious: ACENOOR 13F CORO... +11 300
#note And now CORONAE is just the play I need, and it is a much better play this turn than last turn. Quackle hilariously suggests CAN(DID)... 
>Nyx: ?AFLNSY G12 F.Y +9 252
#note I think this play is forced. All of Nyx's options are terrible. This at least makes me react, instead of do nothing. Quackle suggests FID at 4k, but Quackle is assuming I'm going to play a 3 starting with the R at h13, which I'm never ever doing here.
>insidious: AEHIJNP H13 .AJ +35 335
>Nyx: ?AGLNRS -AGLR +0 252
#note I'd just play HIPSTERS here, since every play does nothing at all. I don't understand the exchange. The case S is less valuable than earlier, even though the board was closed earlier, because it had a chance of being pryed open by setups. This board isn't going to open.
>insidious: EHIINPT K4 H. +12 347
#note I didn't feel like there was any point in exchanging, when I can score. And I saw no reason to play F11 HIC, PIC, or TIC. I also saw no reason to keep the H, although it's a great tile, because it's a horrible defensive tile. So I played this, making sure to keep the P, since iNyx plays at f11, I can respond defensively. 
>Nyx: ?INSUVY 10G .....S +22 274
#note No other options.
>insidious: EIILNPT -  +0 347
#note The only plays available are F11 PIC, TIC, PEC, TEC (No reason to play any of those) and (R)E 10N, but there's no reason to play the E either. Thus, I passed, which destroys the sim, lol.
>Nyx: ?GINUVY F13 .rU +9 283
#note Can you believe this! Nyx doesn't have a single play that DOESN'T burn the blank, and Nyx cannot exchange. Thus, Nyx MUST burn the blank or pass! So Nyx should optimally pass back, and I should pass back again, and Nyx should play the blank. Amazing stuff!
>insidious: EIILNPT 15D PI. +8 355
#note I didn't see any bingos this gave back, so I played this.
>Nyx: EGIKNVY 12D KIE. +27 310
>insidious: AEILNOT E10 AN. +6 361
#note Quackle actually thinks I played the correct endgame, to my surprise, but it may not be correct- I'll let you figure out the endgame on your own.
>Nyx: GNRVY 10C RY. +6 316
#note However, great game with very interesting decisions! Hope my commentary was useful in some way.
