>Alastair_Richards: ?AFIKLT 8D FLoKATI +84 84
#note my first time playing Alastair, I'd seen him play really well in a couple of games at my table.
>JD: CDHIOPX 9F POX +32 32
#note OXID at 9E wins a sim by a bit, I guess because it makes it easier for me to overlap next turn. in spite of keeping a vowel POX doesn't actually bingo more often next turn.
>Alastair_Richards: ?EEIRTU 10C sUETIER +81 165
>JD: CDEFHIN 11B FIND +25 57
#note I'm now already in "desperately keep board open" mode
>Alastair_Richards: AEERS K8 SAREE +24 189
#note smart play
>JD: CEEHIRT L9 HERETIC +93 150
#note lucky me
>Alastair_Richards: HIZ 15L .HIZ +54 243
>JD: ALORSVY J12 VLY +23 173
#note the problem with this play is that I really need to create an S hook if possible. failing that, quackle's suggestion of TYRO at I8 is a decent temporizing move.
>Alastair_Richards: IQS M7 QIS +30 273
#note it was basically a guarantee that he was going to play over here and cut out the easy lane. at least I have a couple of lanes to try to hit still.
>JD: ACDORSS D8 .O..D +18 191
#note this play seems to give me a real chance at pulling some kind of comeback if I can hit row 13 soon enough
>Alastair_Richards: OO M13 OO. +18 291
>JD: ABCRSSY N12 BY +13 204
#note my first play of the game that looks like a big mistake, I just give him cheap points and he can block my lane on row N. Quackle has some good suggestions - BYRL at E5 would be a nice way to open the board, or I could also play ICY or SATYR for 33. any of those 3 options are way better than my play.
>Alastair_Richards: AERTW O8 WRATE +32 323
>Alastair_Richards: BINNR (challenge) +5 328
>JD: ACOPRSS F6 CO... +14 218
#note I could also tack on the S for 10 extra points. It would decrease my flexibility a bit, but I probably need all the points I can get. Also, my last move really killed me - I was still in striking range until giving him free points with my last move.
>Alastair_Richards: BINNR 14E BRINN. +13 341
>Alastair_Richards: GIMNTU (challenge) +5 346
>JD: AGIPRSS 9B AP. +15 233
#note quackle hates it but I'm not giving up yet...I need as many lanes as I can get my hands on.
>Alastair_Richards: GIMNTU A4 MUTING +43 389
>JD: AEGIRSS B1 AGRISES +82 315
#note better than nothing, I could still win if I draw the J
>Alastair_Richards: AJ A1 JA +57 446
#note ok, well I guess not then
>JD: AAEOTUV 15A VAUTE +31 346
>Alastair_Richards: EEW C1 WEE +33 479
>JD: AADDNNO H12 DO.A +21 367
#note should've just played DONNA at D2 trying to draw an out.
>Alastair_Richards: GLLMOOU 6F .OLUGO +13 492
#note not quite the right idea, MUIL at J6 is best
>JD: ADENN G13 D.N +13 380
>Alastair_Richards: LM K5 M. +8 500
>JD: AEN 4A ..NAE +21 401
#note I think I made a pretty good effort of this until playing BY on move 6.
