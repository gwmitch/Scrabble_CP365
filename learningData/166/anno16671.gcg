>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AMORTX 8A MAX. +39 241

#note I'm not sure what I exchanged here, but it can't have been good. LORN is much better. I was looking at CORN, but hat woud kill my only spot for a good Z play

>Matt_Bernardina: DIS E5 DI.S +35 324
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?FIJOUU D2 J.hU +24 327
#note This is an interesting turn. There are a few options. F(O)U for 22, leaving him to block the entire lane that I have, and leaving me with a weak J play next turn. JEhU, burning the blank for 4 extra turns, and JEU. U(P) for 6 wins the sim, with an 18% win chance. After that is (M)U. I'm notsure why though. I knew I couldn't play JO(E)s or anything like it
