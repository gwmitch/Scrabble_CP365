>JD: ?DFHIMR 8H HM +14 14
#note should HM always be placed at 8G? my placement at 8H is worse by a whole 3 points, and I apparently allow more points while bingoing less. hmm. also, quackle says to take the extra 4 points for FIRM.

>JD: ?DEFIIR D7 .ERIFIeD +80 94
#note I believe I saw DEIFIER but chickened out of it. hmm.

>JD: ?AEFSTV --  -92 275
#note unfortunately, on this play I got confused with MAUVEST# which I knew was good. Even after this mixup I am still a prohibitive favorite.

>Joanne_Craig: GIIOST K5 O.IGIST +32 214
>Joanne_Craig: AEMNORU (challenge) +5 219
#note nice play given her knowledge of my tiles - I think I had studied this but it looked dumb enough that I challenged anyway
>JD: ?CEISTU 12H nEUSTIC +75 375
#note It took me approximately 93 minutes to see this word. somehow I didn't even think of JUSTICE. Also, the bizarre CESTUIS makes a reappearance.
>Joanne_Craig: AEMNORU 4G NEUROMA +80 299
>Joanne_Craig: AEMNORU --  -80 219
#note I was half-expecting her to try the hook here.

>JD: ILNPSUY M3 YUP +37 435
#note PUISNY# is hilarious, and also the correct play
>Joanne_Craig: AEENR 8K .REEN +21 252
>JD: ACEILNS 3L ..C +10 445
#note too bad for me that she blocked SANICLE (assuming that I remember OUPA#). no idea what I was thinking here, should just fish the I for FIL and hope to hit the N for a bingo, although I can still hit some bingos after MYC and I do block her easy bingos.
>Joanne_Craig: ADEGRRS N6 GR.ED +15 267
>JD: AEIILNS A1 SALINE +27 472
#note she has RUSA#/URSA at the right so I should really block
>Joanne_Craig: ARSU 1A .URA +5 272
#note she somehow had me mistracked
