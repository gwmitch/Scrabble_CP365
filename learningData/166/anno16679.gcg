#note I spend almost 9 minutes trying to overlap and get a few extra points, and then...
>Diana_Grosman: EHKNRST 13F TH.NKERS +90 104
>Winter: ADDIOTW 12K WOAD +27 98
>Diana_Grosman: MOP 11J POM +31 135

#note So it begin.

>Diana_Grosman: EZ F8 .EZ +35 170
>Winter: EJLLOTV 12B VOLTE +18 116
#note Yep, I figured, that if I had been playing optimally, I could have squeezed out a win. I figure that any 1900+ player would have won even with these tiles, but I'm rusty on seeing the 5s that don't come up that often.
>Diana_Grosman: AQ I6 QA. +13 183
>Winter: BCIJLRS J4 CRIB +27 143
#note I knew that Quackle would give up the J, because it favours the bingo leave, but against a player like Diana, it's a mistake to give up the easy comebacks. If the board gets tight and she runs out of easy scoring, I can slowly catch up.	
>Diana_Grosman: EGRSY O8 GREYS +40 223
>Winter: CEJLRSX C11 J.LE +22 165
#note At some point I HAVE to catch a setup, or I will lose.
>Diana_Grosman: AF N10 FA. +33 256

>Diana_Grosman: NO 8M NO. +4 260
>Winter: BCIIIRV 4J .IVIC +24 249
>Diana_Grosman: ADDS O1 DADS +35 295
#note Probably shoulda tried to stick the C on there.
>Winter: BGIOORU 14A OB. +33 282
#note Still winnable.
>Diana_Grosman: AE 14G A.E +10 305
#note Especially if she keeps doing stuff like this.T
>Winter: EGIIORU 11C .EU +26 308
#note Okay, it's on. If my tiles don't go to hell, I win.
>Diana_Grosman: NO 7M ON +8 313
>Winter: GIINORU N1 IN +11 319
#note Cannot let her bingo. That's the only way she wins, if the tiles are balanced. Obviously Quackle hates it, because Quackle wants to bingo. It doesn't understand how to play weaker oops.
>Diana_Grosman: AMNT M1 MAT.N +23 336
>Winter: GIOOPRU 9J GIRO +10 329
#note Of course if I continue to duck a balanced rack, I will need to play perfect to win, and I'm not there yet.
>Diana_Grosman: EE 15H .EE +5 341
>Winter: IIOPUUU 14M PIU +15 344
#note Wow. Just. Wow.
>Diana_Grosman: AEEEGHW K3 H.E +16 357
#note All but two of her suggested plays win. Of course. How many times does a player draw 3 Us in a close endgame and go on to win
>Winter: DILORUU A13 L.. +10 354
#note Not sure why Quack is telling me that L(OX) wins.
>Diana_Grosman: AEEGW 7L E.. +3 360
>Winter: DIORUU 6N OI +9 363
#note Missed her out play, but I was toast anyway.
>Diana_Grosman: AEGW G4 WAGE. +10 370
#note So, I'm still hunting for my first win of the year.
>Diana_Grosman:  (DRUU) +10 380
