#note Not thrilled with some of the other options. HAE 7E gives up huge overlaps. I think this limits damage while not giving too much offense. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: DENNT E6 T..NNED +22 54
>Matt_Canik: AAEIRSU 12D A.IEU +14 29
#note URAEI, A(D)IEU, U(N)AI were the three candidate options. URAEI gives up lots of points, UNAI literally scores 6. Sim likes this play the best.

#note This, (T)UQUE 14H, and QUA(N)T 10B were the choices. He played PILI really fast which implied another I, but then I saw there was only one left and realized that he might just have other vowels. 

In hindsight no, it's pretty obvious he's got another I here and I shouldn't set it up like this.
