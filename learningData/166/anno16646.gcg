#note WINDUP is 2 more
>Joshua_Sokol: EILMNSS 10F SIMNELS +78 94
#note I only saw LIMPNESS after playing this, although this looks fine and scores more. PLENISMS is also good
>Joel_Wapnick: EORTX 5D EX.ORT +30 74
>Joshua_Sokol: GGOQRTV 4C GRO.T +27 121
#note GROV(E)? GORG(E)T? Exchange? GORG(E) might be interesting too if I draw an A for QAT/GORGET. I really just wanted to score and since GRO(U)T also blocked the H1 triple spot I decided it was the play.
>Joel_Wapnick: AARY 7A RAYA +20 94
>Joshua_Sokol: DGQSUVW B6 V.W +17 138
#note Great draw! Here I had to decide between VUGS which could yield me a really nice QU play that Joel is unlikely to block or V(A)W which partially blocks the dangerous spot Joel has opened. I chose the latter as I could still set up my Q if I wanted to or just get rid of it next turn, if I'm lucky for good points.

#note I preferred not to double my i's here. GO(E)THIT(E) J3 is a cool option!

>Joshua_Sokol: EGIOTTY 2A GOY +31 331
#note I realized that I failed to consider H3 GY(R)O or T(Y)RO after this play. They probably aren't correct despite their defensive merits but I'm just unhappy I failed to consider them during my turn
>Joel_Wapnick: ?AAADPS C9 PAnADAS +86 342
#note nice! I didn't hold this cause I had no friggin idea
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EIOTTT 15A TO.T +15 346
#note There's the game. I missed J1 TOIl(E)TTE!
>Joel_Wapnick: AIMU 11J MA.UI +40 382
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEEIIT 14B B.IT +22 368
#note 4J BITE Is quite obvious. I was paranoid of 14B, something that is really stupid.
>Joel_Wapnick: BCEHN 4J BENCH +31 413
#note It's at this point where I do something ridiculous. I draw 4 tiles out of the bag! I reluctantly say "I overdrew" and I mix my tiles on the table. I'm crossing my fingers because probability is on my side, but only ever so slightly. Joel turns over an E that I don't need, a T, and then MY BLANK! :(:( He says "I think I'll take that" and chuckles. I start crying (not actually). He says "well, I guess I should play 5 tiles". UGH.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFILOT N3 T.IO +9 377
#note But I don't give up. I still try to find the best play, which I fail at. N7 TELO(I) gives me the most spread. At least I knew what to block.
