#note should really just play BARIUM, this leave isn't going anywhere

#note I could also play WOMB which seriously lowers his options.

#note BOUDOIR looks a little better, the board gets thrown open but I have a good leave to build with. this gives him lots of easy points.

#note with both blanks out there and four Ns to complete my rack, I should be turning over more tiles, so GAK or SKAG are both reasonable. also, KOURA# (which I didn't know) just scores a lot more.
>Wayne_Kelly: IQ A11 QI +26 194
>JD: ABGIORS J1 OB +21 175
#note he could play QI with a lot of different leaves, so I shouldn't be that scared of opening, but OBA definitely looks better than just OB - the A doesn't help that leave especially, and I give myself an extra chance at the blank. I almost played BON instead, in which case his bingo wouldn't have played, which is the risk of this play.

#note no regular play seemed to give me any hope of getting back into this game, at least if I played this and drew the miracle draw it would be hard to block.
