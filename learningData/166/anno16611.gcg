#note quackle much prefers a fishy move like OD at 9H, which creates two nice lanes and bingoes 55% of the time. that seems much better. my play also makes me bingo less than MEAD at 7F even though I am likely to have the better leve. not good.

#note john said he thought he would win after this play. I challenged. It is good in CSW but not TWL.

#note tough call because I have the case letter that goes at 8A (the A) so I should be in no hurry to cash this spot. but it scores too much to pass up.

#note the moment of truth, apparently this wins 5.5/8 endgames. I could see that drawing a vowel was a win but the other endgames are challenging. He would have to play perfectly to take any of the other endgames.

#note john totally outplayed me, but I luck out and snag this one at the end.
