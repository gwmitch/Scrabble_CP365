>Evans_Clinchy: AEIILOT -IIO +0 0
#note Sims best. I hate vowelly openings like OI and low-scoring long openings like AIOLI.
>Piotr_Andronowski: OOOOOOO -OOOOOOO +0 0
>Evans_Clinchy: AAELRRT 8H AR +4 4
#note This looks stupid but I'm pretty sure it's best.
>Piotr_Andronowski: JO 7H JO +22 22
>Evans_Clinchy: AEELRRT J6 ALERTER +74 78
#note A lot of things sim close. I figured this would be the slightly more defensive option - no S hook.
>Piotr_Andronowski: ADEENNS 12E ENSNA.ED +70 92
>Evans_Clinchy: ABDIOWX H11 I.BOX +42 120
#note DEWAX 11I sims better by about 2 points. That surprises me - I thought the ADW leave was much more exciting, especially with a couple good spots for the W open. I might even get a -WARD bingo making JAW, though that's a long shot...
>Piotr_Andronowski: FZ K11 F.Z +40 132
>Evans_Clinchy: AADILNW 9F INWA.D +29 149
#note Doing that thing where I turn over tiles with both blanks unseen. That's why I chose this over just WARD, or WALD# K5. Both of those sim 1-2 points better.
>Piotr_Andronowski: MOO 13K .OOM +33 165
>Evans_Clinchy: AAELLRY O8 REALLY +49 198
>Evans_Clinchy: AAELLRY --  -49 149
#note THIS IS THE WORST PLAY EVER. ZOOMY* is a terrible terrible terrible phony... but also, if I think it's good, I'M MISSING TWO BINGOS. *castigates self*
>Piotr_Andronowski: GNPR 14F PR.NG +18 183
>Evans_Clinchy: AAELLRY 11C LAY +22 171
#note This sims a bit behind RYAL# 14L, a very strong defensive play. I figured I needed some volatility now, though, playing from behind. LAY gives me the ALAY# hook and a chance to go on the offensive.
>Piotr_Andronowski: ACFIM B10 MAFIC +43 226
>Evans_Clinchy: AAELOOR A7 ALOO +16 187
#note Tunnelled in on this spot... figured it would be easier to bingo with the A there. Sim says just to take the 4 extra points with ALOO# 10D for 20.

>Piotr_Andronowski: EIOU C3 EUOI +19 351
>Evans_Clinchy: BDEGLVW 13A V.EW +20 320
#note I really didn't want to play BLEW, even though it's great equity-wise. Thought it would make the board too easy for Piotr to control, with bingo lines disappearing fast - maybe if I keep BDGL, I can draw E's and blanks and hit BEAGLED up top. Quackle says quit whining and take the easy 35.
>Piotr_Andronowski: DEEOST L1 DE.OTES +49 400
>Evans_Clinchy: BDGILTY M2 D.Y +17 337
#note Shrug, I dunno. This at least gives me a chance at bingos in multiple spots - there's BLIGHTED up top, OBLIGATI in line F and BOLTING, BELTING etc in line D.
>Piotr_Andronowski: ??AEINU D1 gUANInE +79 479
#note Bleh, whatever.
