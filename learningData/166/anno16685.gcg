#note this is a bit unfortunate since i had two Ss. i guess it's not all that improbable.

#note i was almost convinced DEFFS* was good. DEFF* isn't even good. i was somehow completely unable to consider the simple J4 CLEFS. (-5)

#note (-2) CLEFS, just dump the S for it for a better leave. DEF is worth a thought too.

#note this was the mistake of the match. big strategy fail. i have the case S so her hitting the top row is really not that likely; it could happen and yes i'd be screwed, but if i play RELIC i actually still have a pretty good shot to draw QUINSIES next turn. this is a good example of a situation where you have to carefully weigh probabilities. as a risk-averse person, i was worried of her low chance of bingoing to the T ruining everything, plus as always i was low on time so i hadn't seen RELIC yet (just CEILS, which is basically the same idea but makes QUINSIES much less likely). i figured i could outrun a bingo with QUINSIES a lot of the time.

#note basically gg. my only real shot is to fish for RELEARNT and hope she doesn't block it, i think.
