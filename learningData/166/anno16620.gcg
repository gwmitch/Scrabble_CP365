#note Wasn't positive about TRIPPER. It's good.

>Dave_Wiegand: IIIII -IIIII +0 114
>Evans_Clinchy: DFJSVWY F4 J.W +21 135
#note Sim slightly prefers VOW instead of JOW. Keeps the J for a big play later. Good idea.
>Dave_Wiegand: BCENO D11 BONCE +30 144
>Evans_Clinchy: ADFOSVY 15A FAY.D +36 171
#note FOVEA sims better. I figured shrug, why not score 3 extra.
>Dave_Wiegand: AA G4 A.A +21 165
>Evans_Clinchy: OOOQRSV -OOOQV +0 171
#note Maybe ORS is the better leave here. Running low on O's, might as well keep one.
>Dave_Wiegand: NU C12 NU +12 177
>Evans_Clinchy: EMRRSTT F11 TERM +22 193
#note Best by far. Can't be too fishy here - gotta keep scoring.
>Dave_Wiegand: ANS 3A NAS +31 208
>Evans_Clinchy: IIRSTVZ L1 ZITIS +58 251
>Dave_Wiegand: DEIOR 1J DO.IER +48 256
>Evans_Clinchy: AILORUV B11 VARI. +25 276
#note Brutally difficult. In a close game like this, I just wanted to score a decent amount without opening any big counterplays. This looks decent. VOAR# in the same spot is comparable. I don't care much for wide-open moves like ELUVIA N1 here... sorry Quackle.
>Dave_Wiegand: AEINORT J4 A.OINTER +62 318
>Evans_Clinchy: DEHLLOU I10 HULLO +16 292
#note This is unorthodox, yes, but I need a bingo here to catch up, and this gives me a second bingo line to work with (HULLO takes A/O/S hooks). If I just play NODULE 8J, he can make an overlapping play that blocks everything. This at least gives me a chance. If I draw the blank and some other good stuff, and he has QVY and other garbage... hey, it's possible.
>Dave_Wiegand: AAM 15H MAA +24 342
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEOSTV N1 .VO +12 304
#note Best - it unloads the V and a vowel, and makes it much easier to fit a bingo in line O. I'm hoping Dave has the Q here. If he does, he has to block, which is very difficult, and even if he does, I'll have the more flexible endgame rack. Might even Q-stick him.
>Dave_Wiegand: EL 4N EL +10 352
#note Brilliant play by Dave. I had DYESTER# ready to go. No dice. Now I'm extremely low on time.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DEESTY K10 YEED +31 335
#note Best is MOY 14H, which blocks him from playing QATS/MAAS#. It wins. Way too time-troubled to figure this out. Damn.
>Dave_Wiegand: AEOQST F1 Q. +11 363
#note A rare endgame mistake from Dave, giving me a chance to win! He was low on time too.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ST G10 TaS +14 349
#note I have 7 seconds left and a blank to designate (there's an obvious joke here, but I'll stay away). I slap down the first thing I see. The winning plays are OOTS/MOTS/HOTS at 14H and SAT at L10. Oh well.
