>Qwertyqwaf: EILNSTX 8G NIX +20 20
#note I went for leave over points here, although the two choices are pretty close
>Blueducky: ?EINOQV I6 VE. +14 14
#note Dropping the Q is normally a good decision, in this case, you should probably play H7 Q(I) or J6 VOE hooking (NIX)E (likely words you don't know)
>Qwertyqwaf: EEJLSST 9F JEST +33 53
#note Balances rack well, scores well
>Blueducky: ?INOQRS F9 .OIN +13 27
#note Pretty good play here, best is either exchange q, 10E NO or F9 (J)O
>Qwertyqwaf: BDDELSY 12D BE.DY +30 83
#note Best play, even thought it is not the highest scoring
>Blueducky: ?NQRSUZ D10 RU. +5 32
#note Q and U are best friends. Do not seperate them unless you are getting a lot of points or you have another U (or you are dumping the Q and the U is synergic to the rest of your leave)
BLANKS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER U! blanks=28. I'll explain that later.
>Qwertyqwaf: ADFGLST 7E GLAD. +16 99
#note FST is worse than I thought it was lol. Still a fairly good play
>Blueducky: ?HNQSWZ G6 W... +7 39
#note HNQSZ? is NOT 7 points better than HS?. You aren't going to get anything really good with this leave, no matter what you draw.
>Qwertyqwaf: EFHORST 13A FRESH +33 132
#note This is a really bad play... Most of the best plays hook (RUB)E, which I did not see. I am also giving you an R to bingo through, which is not a good idea for me at this score.
>Blueducky: ?HNOQSZ A13 .iZ +42 81
#note This is alright, most of the better plays, you definitely do not know the words, although exchanging may be better than this
>Qwertyqwaf: EIMOOTY 11H MOIETY +29 161
#note Highest scoring play, and get's a lot of turnover, best play by a good margin.
>Blueducky: AHNOOQS M9 HA. +13 94
#note This play should be Q(I), NOOQS is NOT a good leave
>Qwertyqwaf: ?ACDEEO L6 rECOA.ED +83 244
#note Highest scoring play, your last play made this more points, thanks <3
>Blueducky: CINOOQS J10 Q. +31 125
#note Best play, by a lot!
>Qwertyqwaf: AGILPRT K3 PILAR +17 261
#note This play is not good
>Blueducky: CIINOOS 3I CO. +10 135
#note You can have a much better leave for the same amount of points with M13 OI 
>Qwertyqwaf: GLNPRTW 4J W.NG +21 282
#note LPRT is not that good of a leave, but 21 points is definitely worth it, this is best
>Blueducky: AIINOST M1 TAN. +10 145
#note IIOS is a whole THIRTY-ONE points worse than AINST, M13 OI is still the best play.
>Qwertyqwaf: ALLPRTU 13I PUR.A +22 304
#note This play isn't that good, double L's aren't very good.
>Blueducky: EFIIOSU E5 FI. +14 159
#note With a bad rack like this, you're gonna be wanting to look for points, or a good leave. Points is the case here, with a play like 1J SOF(T)IE 39 is the best play, even thought IOU is a really bad leave.
>Qwertyqwaf: AILLNOT 2M .L +4 308
#note I was taking advantage of you right here sort of (SORRY), and creating a high scoring bingo lane, that I expected you would not block, and from your plays, I could tell your chances of havinga biingo were quite low. This is an example of a fishing play, as I hit a 7 letter word with 12/28 of the tiles in the bag, and 10 of those words play at either O1 or O2 for 74+ points. Not a play that I'd likely make in a game, as it is too risky, but against you, I thought I could pull it off :P
>Blueducky: EEIIOSU 4J ....S +9 168
#note Nothing scores well here, and there is no way to have a good leave without exchanging. EEIIOU is a REALLY bad leave, almost FIFTY POINTS(!) worse than ES, which is the best to exchnage down to.
>Qwertyqwaf: AILNORT 1H AROIN. +21 329
#note I missed my fish (and you blocked my lane), and there are no good bingo lanes left, so I should just go for points or to close up some lanes (with a play like B10 NO(R)). As a demonstration game, I wanted to score, and open new lanes.
>Blueducky: EEEIIOU I13 .IE +5 173
#note EXCHANGE (only leave an E)
>Qwertyqwaf: BDLOSTT 15D BLOTT.D +39 368
#note Takes out the immediate threat of a high-scoring play on row 15, and is my highest scoring play.
>Blueducky: EEGIKOU M13 .GO +4 177
#note Although IOU is also a bad leave, you should play GEEK D3, as it scores well.
>Qwertyqwaf: AENOSUV O1 VAU +21 389
#note I'll explain this play when I can talk to you, it is a good one tho.
>Blueducky: EEEIIKU 6K ..K +6 183
#note PRE-ENDGAME IS THE HARDEST PART OF THE GAME! I'll talk a lot about pre-endgame to you when I can, but note that as you are already emptying the bag with this play, and I have a playable bingo no matter what tiles I have, you should block, or at least play more tiles, such as simply adding an I at M7
>Qwertyqwaf: EMNORST 2B MENTORS +74 463
#note MONSTER and MENTORS at B2 do the same thing and are tied as the best play. Good game, well played, but you still have a lot to learn! :)
>Qwertyqwaf:  (AEEEIIU) +14 477
