#note Missed FUGIO, which is best by far. Beautiful play - scores 20, unloads the ugly vowels and sets up a Z play for 60+ next turn.
>Howard_Warner: ADDN E4 DAN..D +41 237
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IIIOSU 2A IO +16 221
#note Exchanging sims a couple points ahead. 16 points is a lot to give up, but there might not be enough floating consonants on this board for IISU? to be a promising leave. Tough call.
>Howard_Warner: EHJU 1J JEHU +29 266
>Evans_Clinchy: ?IIRRSU 5C I..R +13 234
#note Damn - RISORIUS#. Thought I might be missing something here.
>Howard_Warner: BO C3 OB. +26 292
>Evans_Clinchy: ?GILRSU 11D GLoRI.US +82 316
#note Missing BUSGIRLS, but I think this is better anyway? Limits his ability to bingo back.
>Howard_Warner: CEKU J4 CUKE +23 315
>Evans_Clinchy: AIOOPRT 10F POO. +25 341
#note Missing PAROTIS# K5. Definitely playing that if I see it. Need to score and turn over tiles with plenty of good stuff left in the bag. Keeping the AIRT leave isn't that important here.
>Howard_Warner: ?CEEINT 15H .ENEdICT +83 398
>Evans_Clinchy: AILRRST 12A LARI +16 357
#note I liked this because it opened another area for bingos. Other options for doing that include RIAL 12C (which makes TRIAL, URIAL and PRIAL#) and CIRL# 4J. This is an interesting position. Not sure what's best.
>Howard_Warner: IMNX K5 MINX +44 442
>Evans_Clinchy: DEMPRST M1 .MP +14 371
#note Pretty sure it's correct to keep DERST here - don't want to play off too many tiles, since there's a lot of clunkers in the bag. Pre-endgame solver recommends AMP B12 instead, even though it blocks the triple. I guess UMP blocks sevens starting in S, and there are plenty of those possible with this pool.
>Howard_Warner: ELSW B10 WE.LS +32 474
>Evans_Clinchy: ADERSTV A7 DEVA +29 400
#note Wow, that's embarrassing. I had ADVERTS to bingo out! Not enough to win or anything, but still an idiotic blunder. I was short on time and only had a couple seconds to decide whether STARVED had an anagram or not.
>Howard_Warner: EIOUY N2 YOU +30 504
