#note exchanging does not seem like a reasonable response here, and I don't like BIST even though the CNT leave is better - but is CIS better than CIST? CIST gives up very limited bingo opportunities but CIS denies them altogether. However, if I do play CIS he can just fish again by putting a tile at 10G, and then my rack will be awful. tough call.

#note in this case my play backfired terribly!
>JD: BEFNQTT -BFQT +0 55
#note I hated leaving the bottom open, but wasn't sure enough about BENET#. Even so, it may be better just to exchange now on a board with very little potential to offload the Q, and just hope he can't kill me too badly at the bottom.

#note somehow rafal blocked both of my bingos!! weirdly, quackle loves ZANTE at 14K, opening two huge spots at 15L and column O simultaneously, the idea being that I will at least be able to hit one of them (61 points per turn average). I don't think I could ever come up with ZANTE over the board.

#note missed LANTANA, a nice chance to open things up and blow through an ugly rack

#note ABRIDGE is a couple of extra points, missed it for some reason.

>JD: CEMOSTY M8 .YTE +28 239
#note quackle suggests just taking the points for STEEM# at 15H, but I don't think I was certain enough about its validity to risk trying it. Instead, this play keeps my case O (useful for the OPAH hook).

>JD: DEFPQRS I2 Q. +11 362
#note it's tough to leave row 1 open, but at least if he kills me at 1A then I will probably get a response on row 4. I played it here instead of N7 because if he has a bingo like RIESLING or SWEIRING# I would just give him 11 extra points.
>Rafal_Dominiczak: EILSW 4A WILES +39 355
#note I guess he had the other I, because otherwise I think he would've played SLEW.

#note all in all my most entertaining game of the tournament. I guess winning feels good too.
