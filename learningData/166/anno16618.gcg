#note Way, way too defensive. EXED I6 is fine. I don't know why I'm shutting things down with an 18-point lead on the second turn.

#note Sims best. REGINAL is dubious since it leaves me no plan for the Q on a dying board. Dropping the Q for 11 is interesting, but the board isn't tempting enough to justify fishing.

#note Best. Paul made a devious little play to fork the board open here, and this closes reasonably well, limiting the bingos he can fit in line E. It also scores nicely and digs into the bag to draw the unseen ??SSSS.

#note Yeah, TICKS and TOCKS# at 2J score a ton of points, but he might have a bingo in line F! Heh.

#note Dumb play - I thought I was blocking EMBASTED*, but that's not a word. EMBASTE# is a past participle and takes no hooks. The actual bingo I need to block is DESPATCH A1. I fail. Luckily he didn't have it.

#note Yep, this is best.
