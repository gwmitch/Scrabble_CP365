#note Nabbed your racks/commentary, Will. Hope that's OK! :)

#note Will: I chickened out WAGELESS (and TWIGLESS, I guess). I also spent a really long time failing to decide correctly about those words :(

#note Will: I should have done N1 COVE. VIG is not horrible.

#note Conrad: So close to some good stuff - not quite worth it to fish here.
>Will: ACIINOR 15J IRONIC +29 303
>dacrON: ADEIIMT 2G ID.M +29 339
#note Conrad: I missed AD(E)EM. MA(W)ED doesn't seem like such a good idea here.

>dacrON: ABBEINT 14L BIB +28 367
#note Conrad: Runner up to M3 B(U)TANE, which is a fantastic play. I didn't really even look for it - a shame.
>Will: AINOPRR 13K RAP +25 347
#note Will: Wow, 13L APO seems to be the runaway favorite, followed by RAP. I guess once I pick an E, INRR won't be so bad? I'd rather not risk it.

#note Will: Another pivotal position. CP comes up with K9 OF here, going for broke for the bingo in two spots, apparently. EDIT: that was with Quackle 0.96...I just updated it to 0.97, and it now comes up with the much more reasonable 13H TO. Actually, my winning chances after TO are likely slightly higher than Quackle suggests: from my POV, Conrad must have left at least two vowels after ENATE, maybe even three, and since the two tiles I would need to connect with for bingos are both consonants, that's good news for me. Too bad I couldn't tease that out over the board.
>dacrON: AEEOPQT 6C TOQ.E +14 396
#note Will: If I make the wrong play of REIF, I can go out in two spots with HONAN and win! Conrad plays his top endgame.
