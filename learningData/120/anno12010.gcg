#note This was an extremely weird play. It doesn't sim that well, though I don't find it to be a particularly terrible play. S(H)RI is what I was looking for, I suppose, as I wasn't about to make an obvious play like CRIS 12H

#note The infamous FALTERS rack. I immediately thought there were no bingos in the rack ("ha, flaters, as IF"), and almost asked Dave jokingly if there was anything in Collins. Then I spent 4 minutes working on endgames, and then blurted out "OH!" To which Dave responds "Duh!"
