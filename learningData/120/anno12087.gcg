#note There are several better plays.  VATIC would have left him without much to do.

#note I wanted to play GATH# here, which is the best play, but I wasn't confident enough that I was remembering it right.  It's better than this play both because of the ING leave and because the G tile in the A column is less flexible for him.  However, as it turns out I drew three more N's on the next turn.

>Dave_Koenig: AEGNNNU 4J GUNNE. +14 188
#note I didn't spot the good scoring spot on row 10.  GENU looks like the best way to take advantage of it.  That being said, what this play does to the board is helpful for my comeback chances.

>Dave_Koenig: ?EINOSU 5E NIvEOUS +81 301
#note I liked this more than other bingos in the same spot for two reasons: the N tile on the E column is helpful for bingos, and the E makes the H1-H5 spot more dangerous.  I need the volatility.

#note Surprisingly, I'm in the lead, but it is short lived.
>Geoff_Thevenot: DEIJORY B3 JOYRIDE +72 433
#note Geoff told me that he drew the J and Y after fishing off two tiles.  How often does that bingo for you?
