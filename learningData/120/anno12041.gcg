#note I saw ORDO, but wanted to create another line. Just taking the points seems normal/best.

#note Too cute. 50 points is way too much to give up. I have to play SORBATE, or at least BOAT, instead of stupidly keeping the O for ODOR with a huge -E? hook down column D.

#note If I lost out to anybody on spread by a small amount I would have been pretty pissed at this, and that could easily have happened if the last few rounds broke right. I didn't spend nearly enough time looking through the alphabet - GYNAECIA is 66 more points and doesn't offer enormous comeback.

#note I should just play at 15K. I missed LYSES, but could still have done WISES. Pretty weak effort in this game - the tiles bailed me out.
