>Ben_Settle: III -III +0 128
#note Well then.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHLNRS 15A LEASH +36 337
#note Didn't know HANSEL. (FADE)R still an option.
>Ben_Settle: IJOST 15L JIST +65 193
>Ben_Settle: IJOST --  -65 128

>Matthew_Larocque: ?U B13 .e. +18 518
#note Yeah.
>Ben_Settle: GI F9 G.. +7 266
#note He sees I'm at -0:59 and knows I'm going to try and beat the clock. Of course, he could just play (PE)G for 8. But he feels the phony 3 gives him a small victory :P

#note I wasn't fast enough, -1:01. But I still kept my score over 500.... yeah. And I  keep my rating afloat above the 1500 mark.... for now.
