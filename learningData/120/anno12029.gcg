#note Kenji started to play FR(A)...I assumed this to mean he had the G, as FR(A)T would make no sense. Unfortunately, he had the T, and was about to give up, then thought better of the idea. I thought I would block a bingo ~ 2/3 of the time, and only a couple of the remaining racks would still bingo for him. I think this is the right play.
