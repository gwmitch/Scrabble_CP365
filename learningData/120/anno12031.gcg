#note I chickened out WAGELESS (and TWIGLESS, I guess). I also spent a really long time failing to decide correctly about those words :(

#note Wow, 13L APO seems to be the runaway favorite, followed by RAP. I guess once I pick an E, INRR won't be so bad? I'd rather not risk it.

#note Another pivotal position. CP comes up with K9 OF here, going for broke for the bingo in two spots, apparently. EDIT: that was with Quackle 0.96...I just updated it to 0.97, and it now comes up with the much more reasonable 13H TO. Actually, my winning chances are even higher than Quackle suggests: from my POV, Conrad must have left at least two vowels after ENATE, maybe even three, and since the two tiles I would need to connect with for bingos are both consonants, that's good news for me.
