>Ben_Settle: ACOX H7 COX +24 24
#note After a really terrible last tournament, I was looking for some big wins. I sure was feeling a lot better, I just needed to draw more than 2 out of 12 blanks!
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFILN 10G NAIF +28 28
#note Didn't like FIE I8, that makes it too easy for him. FEAL or NAIF both sim good, but I thought keeping the L hook might be helpful. Of course, I completely forgot about the E hook this entire game.
>Ben_Settle: AL 9F LA. +14 38
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIILOT 8A IOLITE +23 51
#note COXAE miss #1.
>Ben_Settle: BDGIN D7 B.DING +20 58
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEHMTY 7F TE.H +17 68
#note COXAE miss #2. A lot of words play down there, in addition to E(N)EMY 26. Without seeing that, I set up TECHY for next turn.
>Ben_Settle: DEJNOT A6 JO.NTED +17 75
#note Without kniowing his full rack, JO(I)N must still be better.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEMNRWY J6 WYE +30 98
#note COXAE miss #3. ENEMY 41.
>Ben_Settle: ART 11I TAR +13 88
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BEMNRT 12J BERM +26 124
>Ben_Settle: ASZ N10 ZAS +41 129
>Matthew_Larocque: ?MNPRTU 11M M.P +13 137
#note Kinda tricky. Since the board is near impossible to bingo on, I thought making an obvious opening was dangerous considering the tightness of the scores. Sim likes (M)UMP T(R)UMP and UN(JOINTED). M(A)P is 4th. I waited to see if he'd open, cause I know he often does when things get congested.
>Ben_Settle: DO B5 DO +16 145
#note Just like that!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANRTUW 4A WAUR +26 163
#note Yikes. I saw TRA(P) but strangely didn't think of WRA(P), and even better - UNWRA(P). (JO)WAR is just cool.
>Ben_Settle: Y 6A ..Y +13 158
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ENORST 3C NORiTES +72 235
#note Not so good. I just knew I was asking for trouble setting up the Q bomb. I seriously passed up mONSTER and mENTORS because they scored 2 less. I just forgot about NEsTORS entirely.
>Ben_Settle: P K11 ..P +5 163
#note I smell a blank.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGHINOV 4H HOEING +39 274
#note VOGIE 14J.
>Ben_Settle: GLO 2A LOG +12 175
#note GLO(W)? Not so good, Ben. It's double the score and forms a TWS bingo line.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACNOSUV O7 UNCA. +38 312
#note Making up for missing UNWRA(P).
>Ben_Settle: UV M2 VU. +14 189
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIOSV 14J VOIDS +40 352
#note Making up for missing VOGIE.
>Ben_Settle: EERU 2K RE.UE +16 205
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIKRT 1H KITER +35 387
#note Not so good. RETAKE neutralizes both the TWS and the Q bomb. Even just playing KI, EKE, etc saves me a lot of spread here. I may have won the game but this type of error could have cost me if the score was closer.
>Ben_Settle: ?EFILQS 2F QI +63 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AAAEI 5D AA +7 394
#note Low on time.
>Ben_Settle: ?EFLS O1 L.aF +30 298
#note He was going to play out with FEeLS B11, so I put my letters on the table BEFORE he hit his clock. The he decided maybe he didn't want to play out yet. My bad.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEI 6I A.E +11 405
#note A(VOIDS) for 12 points.
>Ben_Settle: ES 1A ES +14 312
#note He missed S(L)E(W) for 21.
>Ben_Settle:  (I) +2 314
