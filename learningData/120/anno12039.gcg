#note I missed ACI(D)ITY here. Was only looking for 5s 6s and 8s that the thought of a 7 didn't even occur to me!

#note Really concerned with the vowel situation, here, so I thought it was best to hold onto one.
>David: ADMNRTU L1 MURA +28 313
>Conrad: BDHLORS C7 H.B +31 365
#note In hindsight, BL(U)SH is so damn obvious. This may well have been a game losing play.
>David: DEFINOT 2J FO.ND +34 347
>Conrad: DLLORST M7 STROD. +31 396
#note I think counted this 35. All of a sudden I'm in lots more trouble than I expected. It appears D(E)L(I) or (PA)LL are the best plays here. I don't really think I considered the option of him outrunning me without a bingo, which is really dumb because often he can. In a large way, I have to hope he drew the Q. If I play D(E)L(I), I can usually go out in 2 if he has the Q, and he has to go out in three, allowing me to hang on.
>David: ACEINTZ 1D ZINCATE +139 486
#note And that, my friends, was absolutely soul-crushing.
>David:  (LLQW) +32 518
#note Final score recorded as 518-400.
