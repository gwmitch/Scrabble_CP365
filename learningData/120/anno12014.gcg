#note A pivotal position. David would not play LOVE (as opposed to VOLE) without something pretty monstrous, and probably the blank. If he has something to the L, I'm screwed anyway, but I can at least try to cripple the top lanes and keep myself in the game one more turn. MURA comes in right behind MORULAE in CP's estimation. I really don't think MIAOU is a realistic option.

#note David's rack. I blocked LINOTYPE.
>Will: AEEIIOP L7 .AOI +17 401
#note NAOI is CP's pick. Just have to hope he has some unwieldy combo that won't bingo to the L or score.
