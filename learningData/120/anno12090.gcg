>Matthew_Larocque: BDEIINS 8D BINDI +22 22
#note The simple BI sims well too.
>Ken_Middleton: IOTX F4 TOXI. +28 28
>Matthew_Larocque: EEHIIST E5 HE +29 51
>Ken_Middleton: GINO D8 .OING +16 44
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIOSTT D4 IT +10 61
#note I almost played TOITS for 26, but it didn't quite seem worth enough points. Then I thought about TOIT in the same place. Strangely, I missed (EX)IT for an extra point.
>Ken_Middleton: UUUVV -UUUVV +0 44
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEIOST 13A jOISTED +77 138
#note I liked this choice, it renders the TWS next to useless for scoring.
>Ken_Middleton: AEP 3C APE +15 59
>Matthew_Larocque: CEGLOQR B10 COL.G +28 166
#note At first I saw COL(O)R, but I caught this which is a nice improvement.
>Ken_Middleton: EIMRU 14E EM +22 81
>Ken_Middleton: EIMRU --  -22 59
#note "Yeah. You're right. There it is. TE."
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELLQR H7 Q. +11 177
#note Bizarre that I never considered exchanging here, but sim still agrees with this.
>Ken_Middleton: EIMRU 7H .UIRE +15 74
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEELLR 8L RALE +18 195
#note He has an M so..... I passed on AREAL B2 in order to block this.
>Ken_Middleton: JMN J6 J.N +26 100
>Matthew_Larocque: AABEEEL N7 A.EE +6 201
#note Didn't know ABELE, just ANELE. ABLE isn't a bad leave though.
>Ken_Middleton: HM F12 H.M +14 114
>Matthew_Larocque: ABELNOY 2E BALONEY +70 271
#note It's amazing that I saw this - I never find bingos with the letter Y.
>Ken_Middleton: DMO 1H MOD +35 149
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGIKWW 15E KEIF +42 313
#note Shameless phony, I could probably abuse this more than I have against lower rated players.
>Ken_Middleton: ESSV L4 SEV.. +16 165
#note He mentioned after that he had multiple esses, so I'm making the assumption here.
>Matthew_Larocque: FGNORWW B2 FROWN +32 345
#note Or WRONG.
>Ken_Middleton: INPS M3 PIN +14 179
>Matthew_Larocque: GOTUWYZ A4 GOUTY +45 390
#note Ok, that was ridiculous. I had to feel bad about such a fluke. Scored as 47.
>Ken_Middleton: ESS 9G ES +19 198
>Matthew_Larocque: AATTUWZ 11D .UT +16 406
#note I doubt he knows RHEME but whatever. Q still hates this.
>Ken_Middleton: ARRS 10K RAR. +4 202
>Matthew_Larocque: AADTVWZ 7N .W +10 416
#note I think this is my rack, didn't write the whole thing down. I opted to leave one in the bag, but I should probably just play ADV(EN)T. Of course, I didn't actually see that play. Q hates this.
>Ken_Middleton: AER K10 .EAR +8 210
>Matthew_Larocque: AACDTVZ J12 ZA +24 440
#note I have to dump the Z, even though he can counter-score with it. Though, I guess ADZ J13 is an option.
>Ken_Middleton: ?ALSU 5H LAd +12 222
#note He has many out plays, I don't even know some of these words! SHAUL, SULFA, SURAL. Oddly he misses scoring with (ZA)S.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDTV N2 VAC +25 465
#note I'm almost at -20 so I play this super fast to avoid a further penalty.
>Ken_Middleton: SU 14I US +18 240
>Ken_Middleton:  (DT) +6 246
