#note I could do 14D OUD or 2D CUM here too, which I thought about. I was a bit baffled here.

>Will: ABBEGMN N8 .BB +13 280
#note At this point, I am attuned to the possibility of MUONS M1, which looks like it could be killer on this board, so I am not willing to give up MN. My play is okay, but J10 EBB is better for the extra points and tile pick.
>Eric: IQ 9A QI +16 302
>Will: AEEGMNU M10 AGUE +14 294
#note I was happy with this play, though J10 and L10 EMU are simming at least as well. This keeps MN for MUONS, doesn't offer too much counterplay (well, at least not a wide variety of plays - Eric can hook his S for a bingo or good score, which seems like the only downside to AGUE), and I doubt the S is still available to draw for SUQ anyway, making the U expendable.
>Eric: HKN 12L H.NK +32 334
>Will: ELMNOOW O12 .OEL +24 318
#note Hoping to induce Eric to block MOWN for next to nothing so that MUONS will score enough to win. Better than no plan at all, I guess.
>Eric: DEIRST E13 IDS +21 355
#note This is best...it's tough for Eric to lose here.
>Will: MNOW M1 M.ON. +44 362
#note MOWN and MUONS are equal in equity (not that I knew that during the game), but I need to induce Eric into going over or doing something crazy.

#note He finished with 0:00!
