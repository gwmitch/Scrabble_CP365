#note I considered VUGH but not VUG for some reason. my play still sims better.
>Judy_Newhouse: LR F6 R..L +17 34
>JD: EFIRSUX 10B XERUS +37 87
#note the board is likely to remain relatively tight, making a fish a weak move - but XU at 5A is interesting because it sets up REFIX. If she can't play there herself I am quite likely to score 48. That said, against a lower-rated player I am confortable with taking the guaranteed points for XERUS.

#note is dementia any less scary after her short play? I hadn't really considered it, but it may be mildly preferable.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?EIMNST O8 M.ETINgS +140 232
#note in this case she had the 3x3 no matter what. SEDIMENT would've scored 18 more. through the A she wouldn't have been able to double the M.
>JD: ?AABCET 15H BEArCAT. +92 312
#note scary because of the Z! but still best

#note damnit! I saw the possibility of ZAMARRA the turn after but didn't spot it on this turn. it doesn't end up making a huge difference, just spread.
