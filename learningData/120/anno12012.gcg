#note I really didn't like this word, but with my rack of AAGIOSU thought maybe I should call it a wash because the results of a failed challenge could be game-ending. Eventually I summoned up the cojones, though, which is good, because he drew AADLOTU.

#note He has ERRHiNE, but it seems like he would have found it last turn before playing HUNgERER, so I decided to just ditch the rack.

#note I got Boggle-player-itis here, and chickened out on COPAY, thinking it was hyphenated. Embarassing.

#note D7 ACT(I)nIAS.  Thought it also scored 72, oops. Only one bingo through the S in IDONEOUS and it's not a 2x2 - can you find it?

#note I'm surprised Quackle says everything here wins 100%. I mistracked until I had about 40 seconds left on my clock before noticing NETTLER, and then hastily blocked it with anything I could find. Leaving it alone and leaving one in the bag seems to work just fine, though, according to Quackle.
>Jason: ELNRTTZ 2L T.LE +8 308
#note Right idea, but best to just play L(A)T, making it much less blockable. But he knew I had 1 second on my clock, so it'd be OK.

#note Again, only had 1 second on my clock.
