#note NG has synergy so I didn't think exchanging here was that clear cut. It seems against the norm to open a double-double, as people always tend to make plays like this shy of the DWS. That still opens a double-double if they have an S or blank - and opens a decent place for any bingo with an S in it anyways. *shrugs*
>Ben_Settle: IORT I6 RIOT +15 15
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEGGNT J4 TEGG +24 38
#note Maybe I should have played this down a square at J5. I also considered GANG J5. I missed the cool fitting GA(D)GET.
>Ben_Settle: FIR K3 RIF +24 39
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEKLN L5 fLANKED +67 105
#note There's another bingo here that I've never seen before. Cool.
>Ben_Settle: AEMZ K10 MAZE +40 79
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINNOT 5A ANOINTE. +68 173
#note I miss this bingo often for some reason. Thankfully I'm playing a lot sharper than my last couple tourneys - being well rested makes a hell of a difference.
>Ben_Settle: AHJ 4A HAJ +37 116
#note Heartbroken he took my QANAT spot, but not unexpected.
>Matthew_Larocque: AACNNQT B3 Q..AT +16 189
#note Missed CA(JO)N.
>Ben_Settle: ?EILRSU 14I LUStIER +82 198
#note Despite back-to-back bingos, Ben is back in it.
>Matthew_Larocque: AACNNRU O12 CU.N +27 216
#note I didn't know CURA(R)A, which gets some turnover at least. ANURAN is new to me as well.
>Ben_Settle: DIP 15H DIP +24 222
>Matthew_Larocque: AAMNRRW 6A M.WN +32 248
#note I missed (JO)WAR which the sim prefers.
>Ben_Settle: AE 9I .EA. +25 247
#note Nice score for dumping two vowels...
>Matthew_Larocque: AALNORR M10 NOR +12 260
#note Blah. I didn't know (HAM)AL. That's kind of important here. I only thought of (HAM)ES. I can still play (JOW)AR.
>Ben_Settle: EIV 8L .EVI +21 268
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELORV C4 ...AR +19 279
#note Now I see it, but it's not that great with my current rack. (L)OVE (L)EVO (R)OVE. Or (HAM)AL obviously.
>Ben_Settle: CEO N6 CO.E +15 283
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFHLOV O7 F.LO +14 293
#note Missed M6 AV(E). This ranks pretty far down there. I must be bad with closed boards or something.
>Ben_Settle: BOSW M2 BOWS +24 307
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHOOV N1 VOE +22 315
#note OHO, I need points.
>Ben_Settle: ARTY F2 RAT.Y +18 325
#note I had PEA(T)Y ready to go. Then I panicked wondering if there was hooks other than B. There is not.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHOPY G1 DEY +22 337
#note Dumbass, play on the other side. The X is still out! I lost this game right here.
>Ben_Settle: EX H1 EX +46 371
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIOPUU E1 UP +17 354
#note PHI(Z).
>Ben_Settle: GIILSS 8B S.I +19 390
#note Yes milk those esses Ben. Hard to outrun them on a closed board. :/
>Matthew_Larocque: AHIOU 13J H. +13 367
#note *shrugs*
>Ben_Settle: GILS H5 ....S +17 407
>Matthew_Larocque: AIOU 8F AU.. +4 371
>Ben_Settle: GIL 2M ..G +6 413
#note IGL(U) to go out.
>Matthew_Larocque: IO 12M .O. +5 376
#note And I miss my out, but I'm at around -0:55 into overtime...
>Ben_Settle: IL F8 .IL +5 418
>Ben_Settle:  (I) +2 420
#note Even though I only drew the one blank and the measly Q, I still had a shot to sneak a win in here. No sense in tracking if I can't take advantage of it, I guess.
