#note A potentially terrible mistake - playing this one space to the left prevents Scott from bingoing.

#note Quackle prefers 12L PEEP. I really wish I had done that, because PEER opens the door for some much easier bombs at N10.

#note The pivotal decision of this game. Sim prefers getting rid of the Q now, and in hindsight, I agree - drawing the X or the Z along with the Q creates big problems for me, whereas drawing either of those with CDEIR means I will probably score something nice somewhere. If Scott has a rack flexible enough to bingo throught he G or H, it's likely to bingo elsewhere too (since it probably has a blank in it).

#note Incredibly, I am now at 0% win in this game, thanks to a combination of Z bombs and bingos that I can't address.
