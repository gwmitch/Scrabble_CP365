#note I would have tried (TRAVELING)S#. Only STARVELING in TWL, which Dave Wiegand was quick to point out upon inquiring of him.

#note Can you find the 2x2 through the C? I probably would've found it as a natural, but was unable to with both blanks. I did see O8 isOBATH, but it seemed silly. No other bingo I saw seemed to score enough, so I decided not to bingo. Quackle doesn't hate me for it, but isn't particularly pleased either. BAH just isn't a good enough play. The real question then, if I don't see the 102 pointer is, do I play isOBATH? Of course, I should have given what happens later, but still...

#note SHELTY is good! I saw that and was like, uh no. Also ETHYLS is plenty good, too.

#note He challenged MEINIES, so I thought I was set. But this is his actual rack...
>dacrON: ADLMPTT 6H MATT +20 332
#note my remaining three tiles were from DLPR - I forget which.
>Jason: ADEFILY 14E .AYFIELD +72 345
#note I didn't expect this in a bajillion years. He saw it after the challenge.
>dacrON: ABDLPRU 15H AD +27 359
#note And with an ill-timed draw, just like that, I'm a huge underdog.
>Jason: EORU 15L EURO +19 364
>dacrON: BKLPRUX 9C K.X +28 387
#note ...and now I'm a huge favorite.
>Jason: DEIILNT L7 DE.I +14 378
#note Fortunately for me, the T was in the bag. On his rack? There are some endgames I can lose due to (REF)T.
