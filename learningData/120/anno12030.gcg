#note This play may well have been the turning point of the tournament for me. I'm really tempted to just go for the column O bingo, and this play seems to accomplish that well. Unfortunately, with her fishing off one tile, it seems as though maybe I need to give up my S and block the main lane here, and bet on her not hitting (MARLINE)S. What should I have done? Also keep in mind that Robin has studied all the words, and with all other lanes blocked, may well try (FOXING)S, which would sink me. I'm pretty confident she'd try it if she had to, since she's obviously seen it many times before.

#note I hated blocking the hook, but I'm in serious trouble now, right? Do I play in the bottom left and hope for the best?
>Robin: AAEELOZ H13 .OZ +42 364
#note That sucked.
>Conrad: ADDENST 3M DAD +22 351
