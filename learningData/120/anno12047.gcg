#note Aargh, what a bad play...UH is so much better. I thought this was OK and my clock was reaching the sub-10:00 danger zone, so I slapped this down quick, but it was a pretty bad error.

#note The two plays I considered here, 2A AH and 15J OUTSEE, sim closely together at the top. However, CP massively prefers E10 HEN or HONE, estimating that my win% is at least 80 after either. I almost played OUTSEE, putting all my eggs in one basket, and as it turns out, I would have easily won, but that doesn't make it the best play. Blocking the FORBS line and leaving the vastly inferior 1A line seems obvious in retrospect. Also, I should have anticipated Chris's likely next play. Was HA really a terrible mistake?

#note Yup
>Will: EEEOSTU E10 TU.E +8 371
#note Well, at least I got this move right, though it's now officially too late. with any vowel in the bag, I will lose to (FORB)S bingos, and with S and D in the bag, I'll lose to row 1 bingos. I will lose the game no matter what if the G is in the bag.
>Chris: ADEINRS 1D SARDINE +80 406
#note And that's what I drew. I feel as if I surely should have won this game and cashed :(
