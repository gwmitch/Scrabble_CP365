#note At the time, I wanted to block bingo lines.  Thinking back, I think I should be wanting to keep lines open.  He is likeliest to bingo down O, in which case, I'll probably want to bingo to catch up.  G9 REOIL is nice; didn't see it.
>Jesse_M: IIIS -III +0 132

#note The only bingo.  "the blank is a Q!" I exclaim as I start to put down my play.

>E_Tran: ALOOUUX -OOUUL +0 317
#note Quacks choice is 13B LOX for 33 pts.  The leave just looked so bad; by keeping AX I should still be able to cash it in next turn.  Sim also likes keeping LAX more than AX.

#note This was a friendly game, so I wanted to give Jesse a shot at a x3x3.  sim says a13 AXE

#note BOOM!!
>E_Tran: GIKLOOS D2 O. +2 359
#note Jesse is already over time 2 minutes at this point.  9k SOOK is a good setup that keeps two lanes open.  I thought my play was cute, as it is can be very difficult for him to block.
