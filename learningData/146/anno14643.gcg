>Jeff_Fiszbein: CDORW 8D CROWD +28 28
#note 2013 Arden Cup, Round 19.
>Charles_Reinke: AELNORT 7F LO +11 11
#note There is no point not fishing with this rack.  This seems like the best fish available.

>Charles_Reinke: AEEFGKO C9 FOG +20 101
#note I didn't like any of the column B plays (GEEK, FAKE, KEEF) because they gave back too much.  Then I play this stupid play, which makes it way too easy for Jeff to score 40 or 50 points at B10.  The safest play would be something like 6G FAKE.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EE 11C .EE +8 83
>Charles_Reinke: AEEEEKW B10 WAE +32 133
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ADPS A12 PADS +37 120
#note Thankfully, he had to burn his S to take out the huge hotspot.  Underscored by 1.
>Charles_Reinke: EEEEIKZ B3 KEEZE +48 181
>Charles_Reinke: EEEEIKZ --  -48 133
#note This is embarrassing.  The worst part is I didn't really think it was good, but it fixed my rack so much that I talked myself into it.  Should play 2C HEEZE, which I didn't see until after Jeff made his own play.  
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EEINST B2 ThEINES +83 203
#note Once I saw I could have played HEEZE last turn, I was quite upset with myself.
>Charles_Reinke: EEEEIKZ 15A .EIZE +24 157
>Jeff_Fiszbein: CRUX 6G CRUX +38 241
>Charles_Reinke: AABEEKR H1 BEAKE. +51 208
#note With the E-heaviness of my last few racks, there is now an acute E shortage.  I didn't see A5 KEBAR for the same amount of points, but this is better as it opens up a few lanes for eights.  I could play BARKER if I'm really concerned about keeping an E, but AR is definitely better than AR.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IJN J3 JIN. +18 259
>Charles_Reinke: ADEIRTU A7 DUIT +30 238
#note Miraculously, I draw the last E.  A5 AUDIT is better than my play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ILT 3J .ILT +22 281
>Charles_Reinke: AAEORSU F13 OUR +20 258
#note Apparently OAR in the same spot is slightly better.  AAES doesn't seem that much worse than AESU, but the U helps in case I draw the Q.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ABM L1 BA.M +22 303
>Charles_Reinke: AAEMPSV 1K A.AMP +33 291
#note Didn't see G11 VAMPS, which gets me within 3 points.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: Q 5A Q. +11 314
>Charles_Reinke: EHNRSVY E4 HEY +34 325
#note 2L ANY.  This play leaves me in bad shape if I don't draw two vowels, which is likely considering there are only six unseen vowels.  Quackle also likes 12D SHY.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?GIINOS N1 .ISdOING +86 400
#note Jeff initially made the blank a G.  I was disappointed that he changed it to a D, but looking back, he was going to bingo no matter what, so it really would have made no difference for him to phony on this turn.
