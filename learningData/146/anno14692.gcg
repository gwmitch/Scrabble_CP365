#note Deen's rack. I think his play is fine.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEHIRTW H7 T.W +20 56
#note Passing up points from WHITE, but leaving Deen with very little. I dunno, maybe I should infer an S from the short KUE play and avoid making a board where you can only score with S. In any case, I like my leave.
>Deen_Hergott: ?CEEHRU I9 EH +12 64
#note Deen wasn't sure of EUCHRES/EUCHRED. It would have been cool if he'd played EUCHRED and I responded with a bingo from the same conso group!

#note Or 3G YO/YE? I dunno. Deen's play was fishy and I liked gumming up the bingo lines a bit.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEEIOSU O7 A.IEU +6 206
#note Meh, didn't like EAU. Because why not set up an S for myself? But Deen surely has an S too at this point. It's close anyways.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EIORSTV 1A ROVE +27 261
#note I dunno. The plays I seriously considered were VIS, VISES, ROVE, and VISOR. I dismissed VISOR pretty quickly because it killed bingos and didn't get me close enough to justify doing that. I hated leaving the N2 spot open, but I knew that if I play there, Deen would just play parallel to MEMENTOS to kill all the bingo lanes. With ROVE, I figure I will either bingo or hit a bingo WI play next turn. And I open a new lane. But I dunno, it doesn't sim great. VISOR wins the sim and VIS is close behind. Then IT is next... and I admit I didn't consider that one at all, but it's pretty similar to VIS. This is 4% back. Playing positions like these correctly is what makes the good players good.

#note Man. It was an okay game for me until I somehow missed RARITIES. How did I manage that? Dammit that's embarrassing.
>Deen_Hergott: AEGILNT 15A GELATIN +81 406
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADFOOST N12 FADO +36 359
#note Hoping to either get a miracle bingo or somehow outrun with a big GELATINS play.
>Deen_Hergott: BDGIMNR 13G MIB +30 436
#note We determined after the game that Deen either needs to play off one tile (13L OBA) or block the E (BRIDGE). He was under a minute, so my speed plays earlier in the game paid off.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABLORST B8 STORABL. +74 433
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (ADGNNR) +16 449
#note Ugh. Most errors this game were small or debatable, but whiffing on RARITIES was inexcusable. I'd say this game had a high-ish degree of difficulty with few obvious plays, but I wish I'd done better with those tricky turns.
