#note INCANT
>Darin_True: CEGORUV 2J GRO.VE +28 150
#note debated VOGUER K2 and this for a while - VOGUER is better
>Avery_Mojica: AABILNN 1F LABIA +24 154
#note CANNIBAL

#note took a while with this play, didn't see K9 SAUCY or A8 STAGY
>Avery_Mojica: AGHIJNR B6 HARIJ.N +43 225
#note He said he didn't see HIJRA 11G - this is a cute play though
>Darin_True: ABCEISW C5 CAW +26 252
#note CEIBAS comes out best according to championship player
>Avery_Mojica: ?EGLNSV O1 G.E. +42 267

#note Again passing up a 64 point bingo for when i really need the blank
>Avery_Mojica: ?LNNSUV -LNUV +0 267
#note CP likes V(AMP)S for some reason
>Darin_True: ?ADEEOS A6 ADO +31 308
#note Forgot about ELODEAS and OEDEMAS.. best non-bingo
>Avery_Mojica: ?AINOOS 5C .OO +10 277
#note He spent a while with this rack. Nothing except NAINSOOK.
>Darin_True: ?EELNPS 7E EL +12 320
#note Didn't think about PENSILE. I'm actually in the back of my head fishing for something that can give me the points to win this.. not a cheap 60 point bingo. In the back of my head i thought "pterins pterins pterins"
>Avery_Mojica: ?AIINSW 5K WA. +25 302
>Darin_True: ?ENPRST 12D PTERiNS +80 400
#note PTERINS!
>Avery_Mojica: ?DIIINS H5 IN... +13 315
#note He didn't see INSIPID.
>Darin_True: DEMQUUV 14A .UQUE +28 428
#note SUQ gives him easy 90 point plays, and based on what I ended up drawing, I only win by 3. (I calculated the worst possible scenarios) This gives him only a 74 point bingo and dumps a bit more. Maybe O8 is an improvement.
>Avery_Mojica: ?DEIIOS 15E DOIlIES +74 389
#note OXIDISE or IDOLISE at 2B is best, but he had only a minute left.
>Avery_Mojica:  (DMUV) +20 409
