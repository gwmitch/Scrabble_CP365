#note Missed ADAGIOS/AGAMIDS. Whooops. GADI is best nonbingo, then DAGS. I need to review JXQZ 5s. GADJE and GADJO are good, and neither take an S.

#note Again, missed the bnigoes. DAG is prety bad. I shuld have taken the points, sinceI have a blank anyway.

#note Right spot, wrong play. VIPERS here is best. Does a great jobshiutting down the board, whichi obviously want to do. Quackle then likes Q(AT), which I disagree with, because it just leaves the entire 14 lane open.
>Liz_Gottlin: ADEEIST 6C IDEATES +70 188
>Amalan_Iyengar: EEPRTVV E5 P.RV +18 266
#note Quackle just wants me to throw open the board here, again. I don't know what's best here, but I don't think it's PERV. Maybe VAV. It's a tough play. VETIVER scoresthe best, but i don't think i's worth it to open like 3 lanes.
>Liz_Gottlin: BEW M1 WEB +28 216
>Amalan_Iyengar: DEEOOTV D4 DO.O +18 284
#note Not sure what the best play here is. DODO is obviously best for defecne, and I think DEVOTE is justwrong, een thoughit scores th most. That's a lot of lanes opened, and it gives them a lot to work with, as well as leaving the C lane open.
>Liz_Gottlin: EMOU L10 MEOU +28 244
>Amalan_Iyengar: AAEEOTV 10D AVO +13 297
#note OVATE sims best, bt again, it throws open waaaay too many lanes, for too little points.
>Liz_Gottlin: DFI 15L FID +25 269
>Amalan_Iyengar: AEKW I10 WEAK +28 325
#note Best. I just studied my K 5s in the car, and I'm 99% sure that WEAK does not take an S.
>Liz_Gottlin: ACENRT H1 TRANC. +27 296
>Amalan_Iyengar: EHNORTY 2F HO.NY +27 352
#note ERYTHRON is the play here, which I didn't know. NORTHER is next, an d is much better for defense, as HORNY gives up the ES(T).
>Liz_Gottlin: AEL F4 LE. +8 304
>Amalan_Iyengar: AELRTTU 1D UTA +9 361
#note n1 me. I know playing TURTLE here is wrong. UTERI is obviously right, but even with UTA, could I just not find UTA and THORNY?
