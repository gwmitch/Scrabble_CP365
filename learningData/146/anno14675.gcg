>Mike_Early: DELL 8E DELL +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: ?AINSTW I5 TAWSINg +70 70
#note Nothing plays down the H or D columns and the F column options (FAWNIEST, SWEATING, etc.) all score 64.  This is best. 
>Mike_Early: ADRSTTZ -  +0 10
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIOPSU 11E PIrO.UES +82 152
#note Either this or PISHOGUE are the only double-doubles available.  The row 5 bingos (POSTIQUE, POUTIEST, etc.) all score 68.
>Mike_Early: EGP 6H P.GE +11 21
>Jim_Burlant: ABHNORT 10D NOH +31 183
#note Lots of strong choices, but I didn't even look for anything past this, as I wanted to take away this hot spot.  Q indicates it's either this or THROB at 12K or L4.  I personally don't like the 12K play - why on earth give him a 3x3 to work with while I'm sitting on a lead like this?
>Mike_Early: KOOT L11 .TOOK +28 49
>Jim_Burlant: ABIRTTU 15H BATI. +33 216
#note Or BATTIK 15G.
>Mike_Early: ACE E5 ACE. +14 63
>Jim_Burlant: EENRTUY M13 YE +22 238
#note Statically this is best, and it sims with the highest valuation.  That said, Q gives marginal preference (0.05% winning chances) to L2 TUYERE.  Regardless, this did work out.
>Mike_Early: AEMX 4B EXAM +36 99
>Jim_Burlant: ENORTUY L3 TOURNEY +80 318
#note Only bingo.
>Mike_Early: AAM 3A AMA +32 131
>Jim_Burlant: AEFGNNR 2A FER +37 355
#note Quackle says I should pay attention to rack balance by unloading the duplicated N with FERN.  With this lead there is no good reason to do that, as FERN opens up row 1 for him where this gives nothing back.  Q thinks this is a 6-point dog - be serious!
>Mike_Early: IU 3L .UI +6 137
>Jim_Burlant: ABFGNNR 8K B.GAN +24 379
#note Not sure I have this rack written down correctly - unsure if the 7th tile was a V or R.  Regardless,  Mike's play was a warning shot that I had to do something to obstruct the O column for the S he was obviously sitting on.  If the 7th tile was a V, VEGAN 8K was the call; otherwise, if it was an R, 8K BEGAN was the call. Regardless, the idea is the same:  make sure he has at least some resistance so he can't hit an easy 7 with his S. 
>Mike_Early: AEIRSTU O5 URA.ITES +59 196
>Jim_Burlant: FJNOSV 5K F.N +22 401
>Mike_Early: ENV N1 VE.N +14 210
>Jim_Burlant: EGJORSV 1K GRO.E +30 431
#note Again, just defending lines to make sure there's no miracle play that will enable him to come back into the game.  Q is being oblivious to the board and saying I should play 12B JOGS.   I'd make this play again.
>Mike_Early: DEILTW 12A WILTED +40 250
>Jim_Burlant: DIJLOSV A12 .ILD +24 455
#note Normally would unload the O, but I'd rather keep the O to go with the J.  Again, just making sure he can't hit any miracle plays down the A column.  Q prefers B10 VOIDS for 34.  Whatever.
>Mike_Early: ADIOQRZ 6A AZOI. +36 286
#note Mike slapped this down on auto-pilot.  He still had 20 minutes on his clock while I was down under 2 minutes.  He realized post-mortem that he could have held his A so as to set up an exclusive hook for himself.
>Jim_Burlant: CDJOQSV 2J JO +28 483
#note I suspected Mike would rush things through and not Q-stick me, and my hunch proved correct.
