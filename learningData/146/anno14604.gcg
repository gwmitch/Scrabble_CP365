#note Once again, I play a phony I'm maybe 40% sure of much too quickly against a great player. If I had thought about it, I would've just played SEXY, but for some reason my instinct is to play a quick phony, even when there's little harm in deliberating. I've done this against Carl before, and it cost me then, too.

#note Wow this play is actually really terrible. I missed HUNH which is just so much better. I saw BUHL, but I thought this was better. HLNU is REALLY bad though.

#note I didn't play LOTIC because I thought WAD blocked it. Yes, really. LOTIC is probably a better play than this. I wasn't sure about OOH, as I disliked ILNT, but it's not bad here. ILNT pairs decently with an E on this board, and if I draw an A I get MERCHANT.
