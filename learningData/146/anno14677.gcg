#note I seriously considered exchanging 5 here, keeping RE...but couldn't justify doing it when I could clear 5 tiles out of the rack.  Normally I'd put down VOMER with this set of letters, but with the Q in hand, it sents up a Q play if I draw an I.   Quackle agrees with me:  this is best.  That said, exchanging 4 keeping EMR or exchanging 5 keeping ER are also viable plays according to the duck.

#note FAIL!  For the second straight game the letter I need for an 8 has been floated...and it's been placed somewhere that I can't play through it.  I whiffed on ALL the short plays at H1.  Also - I thought Chris might not have known that this took a back S, so I thought it was worth the risk to get cute here and play this.  Chris was the only opponent in this field who I would have tried this play against.  In retrospect I should have just looked to go short with H1 RIP.

#note Now I was starting to get a little frustrated - drawing to unique tiles on every turn, the racks were repeatedly being killed by the duplicating bingo tiles:  the AATT sequence on turns 2 and 3, the dupe R's that killed the rack on the last turn, now the duplicated N's.  I screwed the pooch on my last turn, but there's no getting this wrong - this is best.  30% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: ILLOPSY O1 LISP +37 183
#note This was Chris's rack - he said he'd have had SLOPPILY through a P.  POSY would have scored 49.  Regardless, my gamble backfired and he's still in good shape at 71% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DEENNR L3 .NtERNED +68 193
#note Best would have been INTENDER for 70.  Regardless, back in the game at 45% to win.
>Chris_Schneider: BNOY K9 BONY +25 208
>Jim_Burlant: ACGIOXY J5 OX +52 245
#note I wondered if I should play AX or OX given what was left in my rack but felt that I still had YA at 10J if he couldn't take the spot.  Q says I should play AX, but in reality the plays are pretty close:  AX tops the sim at 63.4%, and OX sims 1 point down and wins 62.6.
>Chris_Schneider: HOO J9 OHO +36 244
>Jim_Burlant: ACCGIJY I11 CAGY +17 262
#note Missed my best play here - JIC(AMA) D4 scores 34.  This is reasonably safe - the only possible play that can burn me is HAAF - but once again, all the clunk in the rack threw me and I missed the best play.  JICAMA was the play.   
>Chris_Schneider: HOO 12C OHO +28 272
>Jim_Burlant: CIIIJNS 13A JIN +30 292
#note If you don't see JICAMA (yup, missed it again), your options are limited.  JICAMA wins 58%; this wins 46 and is second best.
>Chris_Schneider: EU A13 .EU +30 302
>Jim_Burlant: BCEIISU H14 BI +19 311
#note  I figured I'd tighten things up and leave him nowhere to score while leaving myself COHO/CIS for my next turn.  Q says that if you don't play SLUICE this is your next best option.  
>Chris_Schneider: AADFLRS G13 FA +17 319
#note This was his rack.  Q prefers that he play longer with L12 ALFA for 26.  Regardless, this certainly worked out for him.  
>Jim_Burlant: CDEISUU N2 S.UICED +40 351
#note All those A's, E's, and I's in the pool and I draw the case U?  Are you kidding me?  With a 20 or 30-point lead (very probably the case if I find JICAMA) I probably play defensively with something like K3 TUI, but the current situation forced my hand, or so I felt.  It was obviously risky for me to open the O column, but my reasoning was that if he didn't have the bingo this very turn, worst case he'd be coming back for 25 and I'd be in the driver's seat with a slight lead on a mostly dead board.  The sim mostly agrees with me, though it feels that I should hold the D for better balance.  But, given his next rack,  this was the worst play I could make. The option that looks much better now - of course, the one I couldn't think of - was M10 SCUDI.

#note JICAMA was tough to see, but I still should have found it. But the game-altering mistake was PARTIAL.  If he has two normal 25-point turns instead of the 77-point scoring bonanza I gave him with that blunder, instead of trailing by 10 on the SLUICED turn, I'm up 25 - 30, I play conservatively and force him to try and catch up on a mostly dead board.  Missing JICAMA wasn't great either, but PaRTIAL was the mistake that gave this game away.
