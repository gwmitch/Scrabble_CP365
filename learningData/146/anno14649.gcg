#note thought about this and haaf. it's close. I'm down so I prefer this.

>jd: ADHILOR 1N HO +20 94
#note should really play HOD here even if it makes my lanes slightly tougher to hit

#note this is a nice defensive play.
>jd: ADIILRW 5G AIRW..D +11 126
#note I like this play even if quackle doesn't. On a sim I think quackle thinks WRIED is best because it expects John to play down from the W as a result, but he has just revealed that he may not make that kind of play.
>John_Gaines: EOQTU 6C QUOTE +18 197
>jd: ?EIILTX M10 .IXIE +24 150
#note I totally missed the overwhelming best option, which is to burn the blank and play ELIXIR/QUOTER.

#note lucky me, except that I missed my best play - GOLIATH.

#note I always miss ouzo. sigh. this is a very bad play. maybe if there was an I left and I could draw UNIONIZE it would be smart.
>John_Gaines: FK K13 K.F +10 253
>jd: DEOORTZ F2 ZO. +32 347
#note he's clearly real close to something. I could block with DOTH, says quackle. but my choice is fine.
>John_Gaines: ABDEEGL A4 .ADGE +27 280
#note phony, but...
>jd: DEOOPRT B8 TROOPED +76 423
#note ok, I'll leave it on. as kenji would say, the math equals the math.
>John_Gaines: BCEELNS A13 BEL +22 302
#note I was ultralow on time as usual so I was hoping he would do this.
