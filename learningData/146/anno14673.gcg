#note Round 12.   Q says I should play at 8F.  My problem with that is that it telegraphs too much to a human opponent and the setup is too lilkely to give back something with an H, W, or some other counter.  I'd make this play again.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEHORTU 9B OUTHEAR +69 69
#note This is the third time in my last four tournament games against Sam that he's opened with an easy-to-find bingo right out of the bag. This was also the fourth time in 12 rounds an opponent had hit me with an opening-rack bingo.  And this was the second straight game in which an opponent opened with a bingo.  With all the difficult games I'd had to this point, this is where it started catching up to me and affecting my play.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGMNSX 10A AX +50 74
#note I've done something quite impressive here:  I've found a way to make a horrendous 50-point play.  10E AXMEN scores 70 and doesn't give back what this does.  Punishment for this indiscretion was immediate.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GINOOZ 11B OOZING +42 111
#note While post-mortem analysis makes it clear my play of AX gave him what he needed for this, all I saw at the time was that, yet another opponent was getting a ridiculously easy draw while I was drawing garbage and more garbage.  Caro's Misery Threshold was beginning to set in.
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEGMR 12C MAD +41 115
#note Or MADE.  Of note:  A10 ABRADE.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: IJOST K5 JOIST +37 148
>Jim_Burlant: BEGLPRV 6I GR.VEL +14 129
#note Yuck.  Couldn't think of BEVOR 6H 18.  This bites me in more ways than one.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AEEIOTY -??? +0 148
#note Now I've completely cracked.  While I've made the occasional mistake in other games, analysis of my other games showed that, other than punting a bunch of spread in end games that didn't decide the win or loss, to this point I've played about the best tournament I was capable of playing and that, by and large, I'd earned the right to complain about my tiles.  But at the time, given all the difficulty, this was becoming too much.  For the rest of the game, as you'll see, I lost my focus and just fell apart, making some rather embarrassing mistakes.
>Jim_Burlant: BCFIIPU J8 .UFI +21 150
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?EEIORT O1 EROTIsE +81 229
#note The lesson here is to maintain composure and pay attention to what's going on.  I did neither.  Matter of fact, I didn't even hold when this came down.  All I saw coming on the heels of his easy opening rack bingo, his Z play, and his J play, was that his 3-tile exchange yielded a rack with EIRT? in it while I was dealing with BFIU and I cracked.  If I'm awake and challenge this off the board he's winning 50%.  Instead I let him increase his winning chances to 82%.  
>Jim_Burlant: BCDINOP 8M BOD +42 192
#note My best legitimate play is BICEP M3.  This is about the only thing I did "right" this whole game, as I actually gain 10 equity over BICEP.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AADEHIR N2 AHI +23 252
#note Sam had AIRHEAD but missed the A hook at L9.
>Jim_Burlant: ACINPRW E5 WINC. +26 218
#note Yeah, you can say I'm rattled.  M3 WANE scores 35.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: AERUU M8 .UREAU +18 270
>Jim_Burlant: AEELPRV F2 PAVE +20 238
#note Missing PREVALUE, and VERA M1.  Did I mention I was rattled?

>Jim_Burlant: BEEILRY A10 .BYE +32 270
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EEW 2C WEE. +9 306
#note Not that I have played worth a damn to this point, but this play made me almost want to go through the roof.  He "knew" I was going to bingo on row 3.  Puh-leez! He just guessed right.
