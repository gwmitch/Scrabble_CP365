#note EAU, URAEI, and various exchanges all sim within a couple points. I dunno, I never get these opening racks right. I don't like EAU, I know that.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADEMY 8D MAYED +28 28
#note EAU would have given him a YAM overlap to kill a lot of lanes. That's why I prefer trading.

#note Need to figure out how to not burn 6-7 minutes on racks like these. But maybe it's worth it. Anyways, URARI is a little better. Once I gave up on the bingo I was too annoyed to put a ton of thought into the best nonbingo.

#note Like a pro. Sim is pretty clearly favouring QIS. Yeah, the S is not too valuable on this board. Mistake.

#note I can't believe how many bingos you can make with BCRS?AIO that don't start with B.

#note Jeremy said he lapsed on FRISKIER
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DELORVW J7 .LOVED +19 296
#note Alright, so here's where I start to get cute. J2 WO is the obvious play. It scores. But I decide to block as many bingo lanes as possible and cleverly keep the W for a likely J2 play next turn. BUT... 33 is maybe too much to give up. It goes a long way to outrunning a lot of bingos. Whereas GLOVED is at risk of losing to a 15H bingo. I dunno, I never trust Quackle's sims with plays like these, because it doesn't realize I plan to try to keep Jeremy off of a bingo from here on out. Still unsure here.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: BUZ 11I Z.BU +30 256
#note Felt stupid that I played to block bingos when he clearly wasn't even close to one.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GMNRTTW L9 GR.NT +12 308
#note Thought I'd have to explain myself to Quackle, but it's the sim winner.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: PT E7 T.P +19 275
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AMPTUVW J1 AW +27 335
#note Definitely worried about 15H, but I risk being outrun if I take a crappy score to block it.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CERTTV N1 .EV +12 386
#note I had no idea what to do here. I actually considered trading, but I thought no way is that the right thing to do. But all the top simming plays are trades. Tsk. Guess I blew it. Though I still win 99%, apparently, but that's skewed because Jeremy is closer to a bingo than Quackle realises. My reasoning with LEV is that I might as well make SOME effort to lower his bingo odds. I dunno, what's the play?

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CORSTT N10 CaRTO. +26 412
#note His only good play is 4L AXAL, so I should block with NARCO. I just made the comfortable out-in-two.
