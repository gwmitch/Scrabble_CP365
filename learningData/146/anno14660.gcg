#note Trying to be a little too cute. Q just wants me to take ENUF/IODIDE. I think against a human opponent, this is probably somewhat better because he'll go out of his way to block. -7 according to Q.

#note Hold AERS, draw CKQ. I wasn't sure what was right here. SACK make it really hard for him to score anywhere but O1, and he'd need an M or X to do that. SACKER opens a lot more up. I didn't know SCREAK, but that's a cool front S hook. Exchanging seems to be bad here. -5

#note sigh
>Matt_Canik: EIMMNQR B3 MM +10 282
#note Joey's been showing that he's consonant-heavy for several turns. If I can catch him without a U, it's really possible that I hit QI/MI after this play. It's volatile, yeah, but I need that in this game I think.

#note Missed this rack. 
>Joey_Krafchick: NO N9 NO +10 354
#note Joey doesn't have the S at this point. I don't really know what that accomplishes though. 
>Matt_Canik: ABEINQT M8 QAT +20 314
#note I've really just gotta hope I pull the S and shed the Q, with a C and two Vs out it's really easy for Joey to kill the board next turn.

>Matt_Canik: BEINORV 9L V... +7 321
#note Joey always dinks like that when he's close, even when he's up 50 and just needs to outrun, and even on closed boards. I'm inferring that he has bingoey stuff and the S, and I'm just trying to draw BICORNE or BORNITE or something to him him back. Q likes B(R)O

#note Joey laughs after he draws here. 
>Matt_Canik: BCEINOR -  +0 321
#note Q says fishing the E and pulling the S is the only way to win. I just passed and decided to try and bingo back after he plays or something.
