#note she put it down, picked it up for a minute or two and put it back down. it's collins. there are no bingos in ours.

#note quackle actually likes ETYMA best. I thought that playing QATS to block the cheap potential -ING bingo would be worth it. It does cut her bingo percentage from 89% to 53% or so. her potential bingos on column O (GAYETIES in particular which she has ~4% of the time) score quite well, but I think this really comes down to just taking the points and settling for the high-scoring potential comeback if she does bingo on the bottom row - those bingos won't score that well and I am quite likely to score well, and she will bingo eventually anyway.

#note amusive seems too crazy, but it sims right up there. this still gives up a big play.

#note I had UNBAN to close column O but I concluded that this was a more dangerous spot for her to use. that's a fine decision but at the very least I should've played NUBIA. even if I do play UNBAN she'll play ELECTRIC and take a big lead anyway.

#note what else? quackle says KUNA at H12 may be better since it doesn't give up a big play on the triple. the story of this game was me giving up cheap plays to let her get back in it. this is just another example.
