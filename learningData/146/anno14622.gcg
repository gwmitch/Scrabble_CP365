#note passed up refalling because I wasn't totally sure about it and I figured it was likely to draw a challenge. instead, flanger drew the challenge anyway.

#note could really use that vowel now. preferable to keep a balanced rack when trying to defend a lead in case of disaster draws. kept the Z in case I draw an A for cheap ZA play.
