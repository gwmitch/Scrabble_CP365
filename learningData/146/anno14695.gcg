>Bernard_Gotlieb: MOW H7 MOW +16 16
#note Maybe he can win this time.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHIIZ 7G A.IE +8 8
#note I really really wanted to keep HZ here.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEFNRST J6 F.NESTRA +71 87
#note Nice.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHILOZ 12H ZO.IL +48 56
#note Wasn't 100% with FENESTRAL, but I'm too far down and I have to open more points that he might not be able to get.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: GGIVY 6E IVY +22 109
#note Good.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHIOTX H11 A.OTH +51 107
>Bernard_Gotlieb: FGIT D3 GIFT +26 135
>Joshua_Sokol: EINQTUX E6 .NQUIET +32 139
#note A bunch of plays better than this. I wasn't certain of the (FENESTRA)E hook. EQUIT(A)N(T) 11C looks good, but both that and QUINTE(T)14B  give him good comebacks with an I. QUINTE K1 also seems pretty dangerous, as Bernard is a U magnet and there are still 3 in the bag.

>Bernard_Gotlieb: DP I11 P.D +19 154
#note He said he didn't have any vowels here for 3 turns.
>Joshua_Sokol: BEIILOX D12 IBEX +46 185
#note I am lucky.

#note INDaGAT(E) here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AACDEHR C12 HA +24 321
#note Look at the awesome tiles I'm drawing! Unfortunately I missed the great find HEADRAC(E)... I knew it too... HADE or HAD 06 here. Bad mistake.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: AEGLORS B6 GAOLERS +71 322
#note GALORES is much better. I might have even challenged, which would have been stupid.

>Joshua_Sokol: CCEERSU 14J SECURE +34 396

>Joshua_Sokol: ENT C7 NET +18 439
#note I said challenge here. I really didn't like RAPT. But Bernard wouldn't have any of it.
