#note WAFT is kinda meh.  I didn't play FRANK because I rather liked keeping one vowel.  I've been worse wrong, but the leave is pretty clunky.

#note Perhaps KIF is too optimistic.  F(R)ANK might be a bit better.  FA really can't be.

#note I'm not a fan of any of these plays.  If the board was a little more friendly to the X, dumping it would be ideal.  Playing RISQUE for 45 seems to be missing an opportunity, but I guess it's okay.  XIS fo 32 is another option.
