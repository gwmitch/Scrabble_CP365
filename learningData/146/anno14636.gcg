#note NONRURAL.  Not only that, but I chickened out on 9D LORAN, which is the best non-bingo play.
>Scott_Jackson: COY N1 COY +28 84
>Charles_Reinke: ?AEFLRS 9B REFuSAL +76 158
#note Another huge blunder: wasn't 100% on TONNEAU taking the S.  I thought it might only be X.  FELSPAR is 97 points, and I saw it, but took the play I was sure of.
>Scott_Jackson: AHILSTU 10H THULIAS +68 152
>Charles_Reinke: EINRTVW M9 W.VER +30 188
#note WAVIER might be better since there's a lot of I's and E's left, improving the prospects of an NT leave.
>Scott_Jackson: EWY 14L WYE +33 185
>Charles_Reinke: AIKNNOT D9 .INK +22 210
#note With six I's unseen, it seemed wise to get rid of mine.

#note I was mad at myself after the game because I thought I missed SCIAENID here.  Turns out it didn't fit.  With two E's open for eights, I thought ACINS was a great leave.  6B CANID makes it too easy for him to close the board.

#note Can't see any way to win at this point.  If I play C3 POH maybe I can pull IMPLEDGE out of the bag, but even that won't get me enough points.
>Scott_Jackson: ?JOS O4 JO.St +65 506
#note It all goes back to not hooking the S on TONNEAU.

#note He can't go out, so I do this just to guarantee a 400 game.
