#note Best.  Of note:  PINYIN 8D.
>Matt_Canik: BEJR E7 J.BER +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: ADHIOPR F8 .OH +31 61
#note An annoying rack - with 7 unique letters, all of which are positive tiles, this rack looks like it should have an 8 of some sort in it, but it doesn't.  It's either this or NAH in the same location.
>Matt_Canik: EILSV 12A VEILS +39 67
>Jim_Burlant: ADDEIPR B8 DIAP.RED +78 139
#note The only other bingo is the same word for 10 fewer points at B6.    68% to win.
>Matt_Canik: IQ A7 QI +42 109
>Jim_Burlant: AACDDLO A14 DO +21 160
#note Not thrilled with the unbalanced leave, but the only places to play ACOLD (7H/9H) open way too much up and don't do anything about row 15.  This is best.  Nothing else is worth consideration.
>Matt_Canik: AGNNSUX -AGNNSU +0 109
>Jim_Burlant: AACDGIL H6 GA. +7 167
#note Board control.  He's just exchanged 6 and is sitting on a more or less random rack.  Unless he has AZ or IZ in his rack, he's probably not scoring squat.  And if he bingos it's not going to be huge, and it will open some nice lines for me.  Q prefers the comparatively offensive G6 DANG for 17.  Maybe, maybe not - to me it plays with fire by giving him some big plays at H1.  For high 20's I'd put down DANG, but not for 17.  Perhaps this was a bit too cautious of me for this stage of the game, but this worked out better than it had any right to.
>Matt_Canik: EF C9 FE +20 129
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEIIL 7H .ECIDIAL +63 230
#note Luck box!  This is good, but a better bingo was available that I didn't know:  ALGICIDE 6F scores 70 and is much safer.  But with the luck Matt was having this game (if you could call it that), it didn't matter what I did, as he drew nothing but garbage and more garbage.
>Matt_Canik: AEMRU O4 MAU.ER +33 162
>Jim_Burlant: AEHSSUX 6K SAX +24 254
#note  Though this gives up 12 scoreboard points to L3 HEXADS, its defensive strength makes it a very sound choice.  HEXADS wins the sim at 91-1/2%; this choice wins 1% less often, simming barely 2 points down.
>Matt_Canik: IPT 5I TIP +20 182
>Jim_Burlant: AEGHOSU J7 .OUGH +15 269
#note No really good choices here - other options include 4L GAUM, 6F HUGE.  I didn't want to obstruct row 10, but this is the only play I have that unloads the crap and allows me to keep AES.  And I can still back hook COUGH.   This wins the sim.  4L GAUM is also a good choice.  92% to win.
>Matt_Canik: BELT N2 BLET +18 200
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENNSU 4D dUENNAS +68 337
#note Chose this over 11G UNSHAVEN for the board position - he has to hit the N column now, or he's going to need an S to bingo because my next order of business is mucking up the southeast quadrant. 
>Matt_Canik: AOZ K11 AZO +34 234
>Jim_Burlant: AEMOORU L11 OAR +36 373
#note Now that I have a 103-point lead, I'm not as concerned about leave as I might otherwise be.  That said, I don't want to completely hamstring myself by maximizing score and leaving myself with a rack that has to be exchanged on the next turn.  ROAM L10 scores 44 but leaves me with a putrid EOU.  This still scores well, leaves me an M, and adds as much resistance to row 14 as ROAM.  Q prefers ROAM, but whatever - everything wins in excess of 99.5%, though the fat lady has not yet officially sung.
>Matt_Canik: EGT M12 GET +27 261
#note A very reasonable risk for Matt to take - there's only one A still out  and I only turned 3 tiles.  If I don't have it, the S, or the blank, there's nothing I can do to block.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOOU 15K MIAOU +29 402
#note Lucky me.  On my 3-tile pick I draw the case A.
>Matt_Canik: KVWY -VKWY +0 261
#note I don't know the other three tiles, but Matt flashed these as he was about to exchange.
>Jim_Burlant: ENNOORT 5D ON +9 411
#note Quackle likes a bunch of longer plays like 3C TONNE, 5C TONNE, and 3D ENROOT.   But having just seen what Matt threw back into the bag, I wanted to limit exposure to this ghastly pool and thought it would be better to play short.  While I don't need the bingo, he's sure to open something and if I can draw into the right tiles, hey, why not?  Anyway, if you don't play long, your options are all limited to dinks like this.
>Matt_Canik: W I3 W.. +10 271
>Jim_Burlant: EINORTV 2F VENT +22 433
#note Q gives slight preference to VERT because there's still an R in the pool where the pool is out of N's, but whatever - the main thing is to make sure that I shut down the bingo line he just opened.
#note Annotation stops here - the only thing of note being that I was a dumbass and forgot that HAO takes a front C-hook, thus missing my out-in-two and flubbing 10 - 15 points of spread in an otherwise meaningless end game.  Final score 462 - 321.
