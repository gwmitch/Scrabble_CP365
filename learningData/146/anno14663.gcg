>Darin_True: AFILMRU 9C FAMULI +20 85
#note This was an interesting rack. He chose the best play though
>Avery_Mojica: ?INORTU 8A RIOT +23 124
#note I suddenly realized that if I take the points now for the bingo, he will catch up quickly and I will have no way of catching up, since my word knowledge compared to his is nothing. I need to keep the blank and score later, while scoring right now with my other tiles. I'm just not a fan of 60-some point bingos when you have options to save for a bigger one. No double-doubles. I found the bingos though. This is the best non-bingo.

>Avery_Mojica: ?KNNPTU 10D TUP +28 183
#note Couldn't remember if PUNKA was good or not. This and TUP are about even
