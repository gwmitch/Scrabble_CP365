#note Didn't like the headache the hook on 10H would bring later in the game. GERANIOL even sims better, interestingly.

#note Nice. INIA is a close option, giving me fewer comeback.

#note Quackle points out FA, which bingos about 80% of the time next turn.

#note I didn't think of DUI 10J, which is a good option. I like this, because I'd prefer a closed board with my lead. What do you think, is DUDING or DUI better? DUI is a higher equity play, but also higher entropy.

#note Nigel didn't look much for bingos because he figured this would be compettive, especially since it blocks the row 15 scoring spot. I pointed out cOMEtARY in the post-mortem, which we discussed. There is a very good play here though. Can you find it?

#note I also considered VOLTI 12F. I liked this because, despite the big equity hit, it blocks the most dangerous bingo lanes when Nigel clearly has a blank. A sim absolutely despises this play. I figured if he bingos after either VIER or VOLTI, he probably wins the game, whereas if he doesn't bingo right away, VOLTI probably gives me a more competitive shot. It looks like he just doesn't bingo enough, especially since I can't assume much outside of the blank, so I should just take VOLTI. My play is probably better than Quackle reports, but it still doesn't look right.
>Nigel: ?ABJMOS B2 JAMB +34 287
#note Fortunately I blocked JOBnAMES. Nigel didn't think of just JAMBS D1 here, which actually would've worked out quite badly for him.
>whatnoloan: EHKOPST D1 KOPHS +43 322
#note I didn't want to open a big P lane with POH. I missed a good option here thoug: KOP 11D. KOP blocks lanes pretty well, while also saving a huge S(I)TH (which I saw!) for next turn.
