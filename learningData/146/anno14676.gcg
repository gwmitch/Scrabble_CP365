#note Coming into this game, I was feeling pretty good - my game against Mike was just what I needed to get on track and I thought that after two very difficult days, I was finally going to get a few games in which, for a change, things broke my way.  It tells you the kind of tournament I was having that my best play (this is clearly best) had to float just what he needed.

#note Now this is downright cruel.  Not only did my play float him the low-prob tile he needed, but he's floated two R's...and I can't play through either of them.  As for this choice - I didn't think of AZOTIC F1, I didn't like ZOA H4, and I felt like the southeast had to open up.  AZOTIC clearly wins, and the rest of the plays - this, 5G AZO, M3 ZAIRE, H4 ZOA, L8 AZOTE - these sim interchangeably and are all solid runner-up choices. But AZOTIC was definitely the play.  (-5.6)

>Jim_Burlant: ABIOTTU 11I BUI.T +14 61
#note Don't ask me how, but I just never saw the obvious play here:  K10 TABU.  This clears the rack nicely but gives up way too much on the scoreboard.  This sucks.
>Paul_Holser: DEIW 4K WI.ED +28 142
>Jim_Burlant: AAAENOT 12F ANOA +9 70
#note Couldn't think of ADNATE O3, which really looks like the only O column play that's worth making.  I thought the AA leave was too unbalanced with any of the other choices I saw.  This is another weak play.
>Paul_Holser: AJPU 11C PUJA +28 170
>Jim_Burlant: AEFRSTX O4 .RAFT +27 97
#note At this point I'm seriously frazzled, as the last thing I wanted to see was the X.  This isn't good in the sim's eyes, and now that I see the options,I see the play I should have made:  OX I8 should have been a no-brainer.  This is horrendous!

>Jim_Burlant: ?EEGSVX H12 .XES +33 130
#note Just opening up the board - as far as I was concerned, the row 13 S hook wasn't open enough to fixate on holding my S, and I figured that EGV? was a hair more bingo prone than ESX? (Q wants me to play VEG 13A - I get it on the next turn).

>Jim_Burlant: ?BEIIOT 10F BI +21 182
#note I auto-piloted this becuase I missed 15A BOITE.  BOITE is clearly best.  This is my second best scoring play, but it gums up row 9 (though my thought process at the time was that, since I still had the O, I'd hopefully hit an 8 starting in SO on row 15 on the next turn).  One interesting choice that would have backfired big-time is F1 BIOTIC to open the board.  
>Paul_Holser: AEILPRT O1 PRE..... +42 260
#note Paul told me this was his rack.  He deliberately passed up PARTICLE; whether or not you agree with his decision, it's the move that saved the game for him.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIOSST J3 OS +15 197
#note Had Paul played PARTICLE on his previous turn per Quackle's recommendation, it would have been criminally unjust, as I'd be hitting ISOTOPES for 140 and he'd be trailing by 40 despite my having played like an idiot.   Instead,  this was an epic fail on my end.  I spent a long amount of time alphagramming this rack and all I could come up with was BOSSIEST/MOSSIEST, and I just never saw SONSIEST, which is the only playable bingo.  In the absence of finding anything useful, I opened a line.  SONSIEST wins 31%, but as dismally as I've played to now, SONSIEST might have enabled me to win as you'll see in a second.
>Paul_Holser: IQ 9G QI +44 304
>Jim_Burlant: ??EIRST 15H .orRIEST +73 270
#note This is preposterous: my last 3 tiles fished have been a pair of S's (on a board without a meaningful S hook) and a blank.  Had I found SONSIEST I'd be sitting on the second blank and only trailing by 30 - still potentially winnable with the right draw.  As for this - SEROSITY, SENTRIES score 74 to this play's 73.  Whatever.  10% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: ACDHNRT 15A RANCH +44 314
#note You have to know it to play it - H1 DATCHA would have been huge here as sort of a last hurrah.  At least I get to keep the score respectable with this.
