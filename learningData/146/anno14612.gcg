>Geoff: ACGORTZ 8F CZAR +30 30
#note Not a good start here; the leave after ZAG (CORT) is well worth passing up the extra 4 points.
>Quackle: AEFLMMT 9G ALEFT +27 27
>Geoff: EGIIIOT 10E TIGE +23 53
#note Awful leave, and the open K column and K8-O8 line are a concern, but there's nothing useful to do there with this rack. 23 points is enough to play through.
>Quackle: AEMMNUU K5 AMEN.UM +44 71
>Geoff: EEEIIIO -EEIIIO +0 53
#note But if you keep IIO, sometimes this happens. No-brainer here.
>Quackle: GIKNOOU L11 OUK +18 89
>Geoff: EIIOPPU M10 PIPI +37 90
#note Back to keeping three vowels again, but Quackle's OUK creates a fine scoring spot on the board.
>Quackle: GILNOTV 7H VOT. +19 108
>Geoff: EEOORTU L5 EURO +22 112
#note EURO scores reasonably, keeps a decent consonant and keeps the board fairly quiet. The N11 spot scores 26 (TORO or TORE) but keeps a poor leave while needlessly opening the board. 4H OUTRE (using the RAMENTUM hook) is second best.
>Quackle: GILLNRY 10J Y. +29 137
>Geoff: EENORTV N5 OVERNET +82 194
#note Only bonus available. Fortunately Quackle couldn't take too much advantage of our troublesome racks before, and now we're ahead.
>Quackle: GILLNRW E10 .WILL +16 153
>Geoff: ?ABEEIN 14B BAN.IEuE +72 266
#note Quackle prefers the 13B placement of BANLIEUE by half a point of equity. 14A BASELINE does about as well. 
>Quackle: GINRSTW 12A WRIT.NGS +84 237
>Geoff: AGIIJOQ 15A QI +37 303
#note I didn't think of GAJO 15H, which would have taken out the  hottest spot and scored 44, leaving two places for QI next turn. It's close, about 1.5 equity points, but I'd have played GAJO if I'd spotted it. JIAO 15A scores 45, but leaves the horrendous GIQ.
>Quackle: BCDDRUX N13 DUX +30 267
>Geoff: ADGIJOS O14 GI +39 342
#note Ack! Didn't see GADJO or GAJO...or JIGSAW down the A column. Was too fixated on the new X spot (and bumming 'cuz ADJIGOS was blocked!)
>Quackle: BCDDEOR A7 BECRO.D +45 312
>Geoff: ADEJOSY O1 JOYED +54 396
#note Despite my bad miss last turn, the tile gods remain friendly. With two more S's to come, JOEYS for 59 is better here.
>Quackle: AADEENO O7 AEON +27 339
>Geoff: AAHHNSS 15G SHAH +46 442
#note With the last blank unseen and a bingo-prone pool, Quackle looks ready to strike. I can't really block every good line out there, but fortunately I can use the H15 spot to outrun about everything. SHASH scores an extra 7 points but empties the bag. Quackle actually thinks SHASH is fine, though, since as it turns out no out bingo Quackle could have would outrun me, and if Quackle doesn't bingo (not bingoing happens about 1/3 of the time) there's a chance I could draw an unblockable out bingo of my own to increase the spread. Either play wins 100% for me.
>Quackle: AADEFST C6 ASAFET.D. +86 425
>Geoff: AILNORS 15A ..S +26 468
#note I thought Quackle would bingo, but not THAT particular bingo! And the blank was the last tile in the bag. We're safe now; the question is whether to block ASAFETIDAS or not. Since the play is 26 and nowhere else gets Quackle's blank more than 13, it's worth just dropping the S to block here. (If you're not sure of the validity of the S-hook, B2 ARSINO for 25 is the next best play, two points worse on balance.)
