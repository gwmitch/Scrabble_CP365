#note quackle's favorite is AY. Had the pleasure of going over this with jason and he pointed out that short plays that make it hard for your opponent to score often win the sims...AY is like that.
>Ken_Louie: ABEIORS J7 ISOBARE +71 81
>jd: AFNNORV F2 FANON +27 40
#note fon wins by a couple. I guess fanon sets up a big spot for him.

>jd: CELNSTV K3 .VENT +19 168
#note pretty weak. VOLT or VENT would both be better. took too long to play the blank bingo, started running out of time already by this move.

#note thought about trying glacees*. but he may not know glaceed.

#note tough call...dropping the U for the fish wins the sim, but if he blocks then it might not pay off too well. I like my play ok.

>jd: DINNOSU 5C UN... +10 279
#note tough call. quackle likes this ok. Due at 9E actually wins the sim. non-intuiitive, but INNOS bingos a little more (possibly from the C).

#note dino potentialy gives him free points on column A. redon looks best.

>jd: ADHLQRS B1 QAD. +28 327
#note terrible! I have a great fish for holards to steal this game if I just play QI somewhere. C11 would be particularly good since it makes it harder for him to block this lane. this play can win some games but I wasted my best opportunity.
