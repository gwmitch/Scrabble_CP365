#note ouch
>Avery_Mojica: ABEISTV -BIV +0 139
#note I just hate Vs. So much. Bad play, but it was very much instinctive... should have given it more thought.

#note I wish she had done LACK so I could have A or S hooks...
>Avery_Mojica: ADEIOST 6C SEDATIO. +61 200
#note TOADIES opens an S, and I didn't want that based on the fact that she had been getting lucky with tiles in the first game.

#note I wanted spread points... so this is a bit better than TWEEDIER if I can get something for a set-up. She can't block it either and I only saw FILIATE in the pool.
