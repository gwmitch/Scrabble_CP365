>mattr: AEKTW 8H TWEAK +34 34
>sneaky: ACIIMNR 9K MIC +20 20
#note Hemmed and hawed through my choices after realizing the 7LW wouldn't play and no available 8s.  (K)ARMIC never occurred to me.
>mattr: BHTU 10I BHUT +29 63
>sneaky: ?AHINRW N8 HAW +25 45
#note Even though this is dangerous, I felt this was the right thing to do at the time.  Second best to HANdWRI(T) (damn, that's tough to find).
>mattr: ILS O7 LIS +33 96
#note Hmm, why play the S for only 12 more when you only have one of them? (You'll see later he didn't have any other ones.)
>sneaky: ?AINORS H1 ARsONIS. +74 119
#note Looks like there should be more, but it's either this or ORgANIS(T).
>mattr: ELP 6F PL.E +12 108
#note Guess he's getting close to something.  Better not to overthink the situation and move on.
>sneaky: AIOOPRU 11E POORI +18 137
#note Of the plays that use up more tiles, POORI scores the most.  Quackle prefers either of OURI(E)/(PLIE)R (16), POROU(s) (16), and (s)OUARI (12).
>mattr: FGU 10D FUG +22 130
>sneaky: ALOSUYZ G11 .OZY +26 163
#note Another tough decision, where I must've spent at least 3 minutes.  Howard the Duck says 'quack, quack', er, play SOYUZ 12l for 13 more.  I like my play, as it keeps the S and a flexible leave on an open board.
>mattr: AEGNORT 12I NEGATOR +73 203
>sneaky: AADLNSU H13 AAL +25 188
#note For some reason, I ignored the D-hook on PLIE or else it could've been ULNAD for 24.  Being behind, I felt there was no need to shut down lanes and score slightly less.
>mattr: DGIU J3 GUID +22 225
>sneaky: DEINSTU 1H .UDIENTS +80 268
#note Had he gone one spot higher with his move, I still would've had the nice overlap DUNITES at 9a.
>mattr: FOY 9C FOY +26 251
>sneaky: BILNRRT 4G B.T.LIN +18 286
#note Mildly shocked to see my play sims first by a small margin over L(YA)RT 14f (12) and another gap down to BIN 13l (20).
>mattr: ACEV O11 C.AVE +30 281
>sneaky: DEEMORR 3L MERE +20 306
#note With 5 Es unseen, I thought it would be best to shed both of mine.  Ducky is telling me MORE in the same spot, E(N)ORM m3 (20), and MOR(A) 13l (22) are all preferred.  Fine, whatever.
>mattr: IQ 8B QI +16 297
>sneaky: DDNORTX 13L DON. +19 325
#note Another headscratcher, but it's the only play worth playing on this board.
>mattr: EJO 14K JOE +17 314
#note Multiple Es usually aren't a negative, unless it's 3 of them and/or with a bunch of other vowels.  Just saying, maybe JO 5e (22) would work better.  But, yeah, I'm clueless as to his other tiles.
>sneaky: ADIRRTX 2F DI.T +11 336
#note I can't understand why I'm initially being told not to block the bingo lane with a blank unseen.  Of course, when I enter DIRT and start the simulation, it's clearly the favourite.  Duh.
>mattr: ?EEEESV N1 .E.SE +20 334
#note This play looked more awesome at the time, although it turns out he has a few different winning moves.  Still a nice find.
>sneaky: AANRRX 7C RAX +18 354
#note I prayed for something better, but there's nothing else even worth considering.  Oh well.
>mattr: ?EEV 3C nEVE +15 349
#note He said he would've tried EVEs or VEEs/YUPs if he had to, but why possibly risk it when there's a guaranteed (recount-pending) win?
>mattr:  (ANR) +6 355
#note Recount didn't change either final score.  Dang.
