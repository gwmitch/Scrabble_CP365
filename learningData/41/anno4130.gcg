#note BAGFUL H1 is a cool 6 (BAGSFUL/BAGFULS).
>Carl: ACGIIIN G11 I.IA +5 193
#note pretty sure I'm reading the rack correctly. Assuming it is right, something like C(O)NGII suits my fancy.
>dacrON: DEEEEFG 11J FEED +25 240
#note thought I was making up FIDGE, oops. EDGE is better too - I think I may have talked my asleep brain out of the D hook, lol.
>Carl: CGGIMNS 15G CIG +25 218
#note tossup between MIGGS and the G(E)M 11C dink. This play is a ways back (sorry, Carl).
>dacrON: CDEEEGI 13I EDGE +21 261
#note DEICE seems unnecessarily risky.
>Carl: AGHNSUV M1 VUGHS +43 261
#note Ow.
>dacrON: ACEEINS M9 CA.IS +36 297
#note CA(V)IE went against my conservative playing, but it really is a better play, so I probably should have played it, since I did see it. Talked myself out of CE(D)IS yech. This is so dumb, because I am giving him a free 30+ comeback in row 1. So dumb of me. Humans use logic for a reason.
>Carl: AAINOVW 1L A.OW +33 294
>dacrON: EEENOTT 2L T.NE +19 316
#note And I pick up my 11th E. Jeez. Too chickenshit to play THEE, which is a bit better than T(U)NE.

>dacrON: EOSTTTX O4 .OTETS +24 368
#note so I am definitely going to take out the O column. Unless he just drew them, he definitely doesn't have both blanks. My play is obviously an X setup, but the S doesn't have much use on this board, and I need the points and potentially an extra tile. MOTTES sims worse, even though it is better as an X set up. The issue is that he likely hits the spot for 30 or so, and then I have to draw well to get bailed out. Ideas here?
>Carl: ?IINNOW N9 OW +31 378
#note wins 1/8 of the time. Carl found the play with the best chance INION after the game. As it turned out, I'd have had to find FLAXe(N) B10 to win the game, if he had played INION. INION wins with the A or T in the bag, and ties with the L in the bag. OW only wins if I manage to leave the blank in the bag, which I thankfully didn't.
>dacrON: ?AFLOTX 6I .AFT +31 399
#note FLAXe(N) is still best. Makes me wonder if I would've seen it if he'd played INION. That said, I was at about 1:30 after (M)OTETS, so I just took the sure win.
