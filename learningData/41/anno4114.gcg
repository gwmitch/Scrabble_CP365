#note i couldn't convince myself not to challenge with the high score and unfamilirity. I know INLY is an adverb, INLIE*/INLIES*/INLIED* - I recognize it could be an adjective but it still seems like I would have seen it.  In any case, it's new and it's good.

#note i need some vowels. i need to leave the underlap available and score some points to stay in striking distance. it was either this or BI for 8, which quackle would much prefer to my play.

#note i'm focused on the lane through the A. i have -ATED underlap possibilities with the CENR, 4/12. i don't want to draw a lot of tiles and risk Q or J. BAD is the best possible play according to quackle at 34% chance.
