#note we had just had a conversation the day before about the myriad spellings of GANEV.  maybe that's why this got to stay. at this point i'm not convinced that i've played any valid words yet.

#note umm.. i can't read my writing. i might have ?DR or ?DL as my leave.  this is in response to the trade one. take out the easy lane.  i'm guessing i had ?DR based on playing WRING instead of WING.

#note oops. i had meant to block the outs, but this leaves KEBOB.  also, i screwed up this gcg file somehow.  it thinks there's an extra A now and i dont know how to get rid of it.
