>Flossie_Swint: EIINNOY 9C IONINE +22 22
>Flossie_Swint: EIINNOY --  -22 0
#note Thinking of IONONE, perhaps?
>Jason: EEIIOWX 7F EX +36 60
#note The leave didn't concern me too much after Flossie's play ... I know at least four vowels are on her rack, so consonants available to draw. Still, EXI(L)E is better. (-3)
>Flossie_Swint: EIINNOY D8 .ONEY +22 22
#note From her last play, we now know her full rack.
>Jason: ?CEIIOW 10B WI.O +15 75
>Flossie_Swint: NOW C9 W.NO +27 49
#note Reading the double as a triple, she scores this as 35 and I don't catch it, so focused on the nice spot for the J that I just drew. So for the rest of the game, I think she has eight more than she actually does.
>Jason: ?CEEGIJ B12 JIG +35 110
>Flossie_Swint: ILR E5 LIR. +18 67
>Jason: ?CEEEIS 5C CE.ErIES +59 169
#note Almost passed on the bingo. (L)ICEnSEE is best, CEE at D3 second, this third.
>Flossie_Swint: IMNOORT 4I MONITOR +76 143
>Jason: AADDELO O1 ADO.ED +24 193
#note DAEDAL, 3G, is pretty cool. This, DAEDAL and ADO at 3M all sim within a hair of each other. Stylistic, I guess.
>Flossie_Swint: EF N1 FE +21 164
>Jason: AAAALNT A13 AAL +14 207
#note Holy balls, ATA(r)A(XI)A! Now I'll never get another chance to play four A's at once. NALA, 3J sims best. (-3)
>Flossie_Swint: EIPQU 9H EQUIP +28 192
#note Weird things happen on my board. First, there was Carolyn Easter calling her 11-point TUBING 22 in Pittsburgh. Then, the eight point error here. Then, Flossie calls this 38 (again confusing double and triple). In both cases, opp. wished they could retract their play after I caught the scoring error. The DLS squares are darker than most, but still. A couple scoring errors while playing on it at PFACT, too (including a DLS-TLS mixup again). Weird. I kind of like the "home board" advantage, though.
>Jason: AANTTUV N6 AVAUNT +18 225
#note Time is right for turnover. Would like to get something to show for this turnover besides copious amounts of A's eventually.
>Flossie_Swint: GGVY J8 V.GGY +17 209
#note At least I'm not the only one dealing with clunk issues.
>Jason: AAINSTU O8 ANA +19 244
#note OMG, more A's! Considered (V)AU ... FPS? The board was not bingo friendly at all for any E-less rack. I felt like taking out the spot was important. Make her bingo (after a four-tile dump) to catch up. Maybe VAU's better, but I like this play. (-5)
>Flossie_Swint: ABEK 3J BAKE +37 246
>Jason: ISTTTUU -TTUU +0 244
#note TTU into SUIT? Really? Then frustration sets in and I miss the star play of (P)UTTI. (-10)
>Flossie_Swint: ACDL 2H CLAD +21 267
#note A nice scorer/board-mucker. Remember, I think I'm down 31, not 23, so I'm not exactly pleased with the proceedings to this point, esp. considering I've played decently and gotten a free turn.
>Jason: EINPSST D7 P.....S +28 272
#note Nooo! SNI(P)PETS! Argh! Here I was patting myself on the back for my fanciness here. Fail! Not to mention that the board is so S-friendly I probably should've kept the S. (-40)
>Flossie_Swint: FIR F2 FIR. +15 282
>Jason: EHIMNST 12I M.TH +24 296
#note I don't know why I thought I could bingo through the P ... twice I've missed eights through it. I decided to turn the game into a race/hope she would open. Gotta like the leave with RRRTTT out. But still ... SHIPMENT. Wish I could anagram. (-49)
>Flossie_Swint: R 2M R.. +7 289
>Jason: EINOSTU L8 U. +5 301
#note If I'd known I was up seven, I probably do this sooner. I'm waiting for her fish that opens, but I think I'm one down and now not so sure about a race. TO(G)UE is the obvious play ... didn't know/see it. (-68? OMG)
>Flossie_Swint: R L3 ..R +7 296
#note No! Open!
>Jason: EINOSTT I4 ..T +5 306
#note The four-turn span from hell is now complete, as I clock in at more than 200 equity points lost during it. TO(G) at 11H is Duck's pick. Probably should be simming inferring ?S, although I don't think ?S is guaranteed. ? or S is remotely possible. (-52)
>Flossie_Swint: ?RSZ 3C ZoR.S +28 324
#note I nearly wet myself when she played all three power tiles for 28.
>Jason: BEINOST 11H BO.IE +29 335
#note Best, by three? Whoa. It wins by seven under optimal play (or loses by one pre-recount). This was an "OMG, all my good S plays hooking to MYTH give her out plays and I'm down to 30 seconds, oh crap, oh crap, oh crap" play. Still banking on opponent error, that she won't see/block my only out or that her out in two sucks and I get enough from my 14- or 13-point S play (JOYS, MYTHS).
>Flossie_Swint: DETU 12B ...ED +16 340
#note Phew. The out stays open.
>Jason: NST D1 ST.N. +10 345
#note Whew. Pulled that endgame out of my nether regions. Prolly didn't deserve it, but I'll take it.
>Jason:  (TU) +4 349
