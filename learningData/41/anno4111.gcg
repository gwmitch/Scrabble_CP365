#note Quackle likes SPIV 12E for reasons I can't quite discern.

>Nathan: ACINPSV D1 VINCA +30 166
#note PAVIN 13C better.

>Nathan: AGIIOPS 1A SPI. +27 193
#note Q doesn't much care for this, putting it 7 points behind PINGO 3B.
>Noah_Walton: BU B1 .UB +14 193
>Nathan: AFGINOU L10 GIN.O +30 223
#note Bleh. Another poor move. GONIF 13C is the star here.
>Noah_Walton: EEHMR 13C REHEM +34 227
>Nathan: AFHLRTU A3 ARTFUL +34 257
#note Finally a good play.
>Noah_Walton: SV 10D V..S +14 241
>Nathan: ABFHKPQ 2G Q.PH +26 283
#note And I'm rewarded with this draw. I was so intent on QOPH I didn't see KHAF 12A for 50. Sim puts them neck and neck, but I think dumping the Q is the play here.
>Noah_Walton: AEENORS 14A ARENOSE +92 333
>Nathan: AABFIKW 12A KAIF +47 330
#note Great fit by Noah, and I get my big 12A play anyway.
>Noah_Walton: JO 12H JO. +18 351
>Nathan: ABEIMNW 15G WAB +32 362
#note He's obviously got the blank. Should I block the line through the A at H4? Or just score and pray? Q likes ITEM 3G even without giving opponent the blank. Also, I should have looked more closely at my tracking. WEB, not WAB is the play due to the 4 unseen E's. 
>Noah_Walton: X A14 .X +27 378
>Nathan: EIIMNRY 3G I.EM +32 394
#note I thought this was a real nice play, but Q gives it only 30% winning chances, vs. 58% for MITIER in the same spot. I can see the logic--Noah's going out in two if he can't bingo, even with one in the bag. So I should play as many tiles as possible to minimize what's left on my rack after my next play.
>Noah_Walton: ?CENOR 1J ORCEiN +38 416
#note Wins unless the Y is in the bag. Q says CONEY M9 always wins.
