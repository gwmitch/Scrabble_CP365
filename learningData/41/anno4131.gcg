#note felt like being stupid for turn 1. Sounds like a plan, yes? Seriously not a good time to try and get him to play R/S for me. Ex. G is cool. I should've thought of that...
>Ian: AFGR 8F FRAG +16 16
#note lol...good thing he put the R in...
>dacrON: DEGIOPT G8 .IDGETOP +64 64
#note Ian: "Nice ploy." hehe.
>Ian: ACK 15G .ACK +36 52
>dacrON: DEIIMTU F12 DIM +27 91
#note MU(F)TI
>Ian: AHLPRS K10 RALPHS +35 87
>dacrON: CEEINTU 12K .EU +6 97
#note (insert good play here). In hindsight C(L)UE was better, but that still sucks, blech. I was trying for a copout luckbox draw, and I was rewarded appropriately.
>Ian: LX M11 L.X +20 107
>dacrON: CEINNTV 13C INV..E +18 115
#note sigh. everything sucks here. And he's probably going to bingo soon, too...I should, uh, start playing worth a damn now.
>Ian: DEGLORS J2 LODGERS +72 179
#note DO(G)GRELS is 4 more and much more defensive.
>dacrON: CNOQRTW H7 Q.T +14 129
#note f everything lol...
>Ian: NNNTT -NNNTT +0 179
#note okay, so I get an extra turn to catch up
>dacrON: CNNNORW -NNNOW +0 129
#note Uh, okay Quackle, i dont think CNN is a good leave. Also, R(E)NOWN seems kind of silly, but I guess an argument could be made for it? I stan by my play
>Ian: ??BETTY 2D BiTTEr.Y +63 242
#note best plays seem to involve not bingoing...or BuTY(L)aTE...
>dacrON: ACDENRS 1K ACNED +38 167
#note Drawing a bingo here sure helped. I suppose I deserved this position, as I had been playing like my head was in the clouds. Time to play worth a damn, yes?
>Ian: EILOTU D8 OUTLI.E +16 258
#note Not sure what to make of this...
>dacrON: AAEMORS 5H SA.AMORE +72 239
#note back in it...
>Ian: FIN H1 N.IF. +36 294
>dacrON: ABIORRW 15A WAIR +33 272
#note blech, still less then a 5:1 underdog here.
>Ian: HOO 4L OHO +27 321
>dacrON: ABIIORZ 8A BOZ. +45 317
#note I considered B(OR)ZOI for a minute, but if he hits anything big with the I, I am toast. BOZ(O) brings me almost to a tie. The top plays are all within 1 win% so whatever. I like BOZ(O).
>Ian: EENN D2 .ENNE +14 335
#note ...?
>dacrON: AAIIIRS 5C I.IA +8 325
#note down to 1 minute after this play. AIRS is good, and a good draw gives me a chance. Probably not the best play, but it seemed safe enough to give me a chance.
>Ian: EENTUUV O5 .VENT +24 359
#note V(E)N(A) wins 75% of the time. This and TU(T)UE(D) win 50% of the time. It goes downhill from there.
>dacrON: AIJORSW N10 JO +27 352
#note This is the best play, but in the optimal sequence, it loses. I had to make this play quickly, especially after he blocked the (X)I setup for JOWARS
>Ian: EUUY 13M .U +9 368
#note obviously.
>dacrON: AIRSW C3 WA.R +28 380
#note I guess Ian must have been out of time too, as he was also making his plays without recording the score.
>Ian: EUY 6F YE +26 394
#note YU(L)E wins, of course, but I think he thought he was down a lot more.
>dacrON: IS I12 IS +14 394
#note Yeah yeah, I(D)S is better. This was all I had time to play without my clock running out. Wins by 2.
>dacrON:  (U) +2 396
#note I played like crap in the first half, which does happen sometimes on the first game of the morning, but I was happy to pull it together enough to come back here.
