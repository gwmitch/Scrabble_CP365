#note I played this instead of NIDIFY because I liked DI, and I got a letter towards (BLITZ)ING. Quackle tells me to play NIDIFY here.

#note An interestng position. OKA, KA, KALONGS, LAKINGS, all look reasonable. Quackle puts the plays in the above order. What would you play?

>Noah_Walton: CGILMNO 5G GNOMIC +32 275
#note I like this play because of what it does to the board. Quackle likes (A)M also. Again, WWYP.

>Noah_Walton: AAFLRTW M6 AWF.L +15 290
#note Also an interesting decision. Quackle puts this close between FLA(MY) (which I thought of) and FA(U)LT(ED) (which I did not think of). This sims 3rd. FLA(MY) blocks HIMS and opens up another line. All things considered, the new line is probably less dangerous because the paralells aren't that devestating and the bingo is a little less likely. I think FAULTED is the play here, though, as it closes down any X spots Nick has, and that really seems like about the best you can do here. This play keeps a decent leave, but it leaves juicy spots open.

#note I guess I must have thought of JAR(S) here but not come back to it. I like JARS a lot better.

#note Another interesting moment. Do you play this, or something like RO(V)ER or LO(V)ER going for a bigger bingo next turn? It is a tough call. This worked out well in the end, though.

#note I feel like this was part of his rack, because he said he was shooting for VERNIX or XERIC.

#note GA(V)E or GI(V)E are a little better, but they all win.
