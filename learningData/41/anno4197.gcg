#note Sim prefers GEEZ 6C.

#note DIF 10D looks a bit better here.

#note CALVE 8K scores the best, but opening the board doesn't seem right. Other options include WANDLE 13I and the neat EXCLAVES 6E.
>Bing: ?AEGNOT B3 .rONTAGE +65 213
#note I took forever on this rack, trying to find something better; somehow the safer TONNAGEs 11B eluded me. (Trying ONsTAGE/DOGGOs* was a nonstarter against Carl.)

#note This was probably quite wrong, some would say bordering on insanity. Fishing off the A has decent chances of working. As it was, I caught Carl with an improbable rack and managed to survive the kamikaze opening.

#note I did see CITOLE 11H, but thought I should take out the triple. Lots of indecision in the midgame had run down my clock considerably by this point.
>Carl: EELRRSU H2 UL. +3 347
#note Nice setup. But it had the effect of blinding both of us to the rest of the board.
>Bing: CEIORTW 11H CITO.E +34 391
#note Soon after I put this down, I saw to my horror, RESURVEY! Yikes. The best play seems to be WO N1, setting up ETIC.
