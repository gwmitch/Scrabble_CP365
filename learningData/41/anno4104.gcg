#note i saw all three unplayable eights here - yay.

#note well, it looks like a word to me.
>k8: EEGIOST 8M EGO +25 216
#note stupid EGOTISE* - only plays to the N which is in the wrong place. grr.

#note i did consider AIRIEST here, but i didn't love it.  it takes out the bingo lane, which is probably good, but the tiles are so pretty! and the game is still close.

#note lucky lucky (but it does play for a dbl-dbl if she doesn't give me the lane)

>k8: AAEKLRS 12H SLAKE +34 352
#note LARKERS (which I don't know) is the proper play here. i need to block the two bingo lanes that i think exist (which are through the R and hooking an S to DENOTIVE - we will learn later that this isn't a word, but i am absolutely sure that it is at this point. it turns out DONATIVE is the word I'm thinking of that takes the -S).  So... I see KRAALS, which I don't love since it doesn't score that well and burns the S, and I see SLAKE, which scores better, but doesn't block the R completely.

#note Lisa said after the game that she would've almost definitely challenged DENOTIVES* had she noticed, but she was too focused on whether her bingo still fit.
>k8: ADEMRTW 13J WARMED +37 389
#note i was hoping she'd bingo with the blank so i could stop worrying abot it.  this took some chances that she could set something up in the bottom that i couldn't block on subsequent turns, and scored well, and moved us toward the end of the game. Q wants me to play W(E)T J6.

#note sets up nice QIS plays next turn. had i seen REJECT, i probably would've played LEG, but i didn't.
