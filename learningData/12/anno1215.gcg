#note You’ve screwed me again, Pennypacker!
>Kelly: ELNRRTZ 7H TZ.R +26 59
#note Ugh. Found the second-best play, but didn’t spend long enough looking at I7 to spot the fairly routine ZE(K).

#note Dismissed burning the blank to play various (S)EX words from 8J, even though I was pretty sure CP would like those plays best. Keeping the blank, the IN? combo is strong, so I should have been willing to take a few extra points burning the E with (P)LEX.

#note CP likes BI-1G best, but I went against that because the bag is starting to get vowel heavy. Still, CP likes BI by almost 3 percent. Second was BI(R)IANI-C9, which would have been cool if only because I’ve yet to play a AIII seven despite knowing them for two years now. Maybe they aren’t all that useful.
>A.G._Pennypacker: DEEGOOO 3C GEODE +20 212
>Kelly: BEGIIIQ 6D QI +15 198
#note Damn, almost talked myself into BI(G)GIE-C1. Anyway, what are the chances I’ll draw an I yet again?

#note Looked to see if VI(O)L would fit at 12A, but didn’t notice it would play at 4A. I suck.
>A.G._Pennypacker: AAAEFHS 2A HAAF +28 271
>Kelly: AILORVY A1 A.OY +42 285
#note Against all odds, I drew a seven, but it doesn’t play anymore after MIB. Turns out there’s a fairly common eight that plays in two spots, but that would require anagramming or skill of some kind.

>Kelly: EILLORV 13I LIVRE +26 311
#note Why didn’t I just play LOVER instead? Beats me.

>Kelly: DGLOOTT 14G GOLD +24 335
#note Apparently, fishing with G(AGA)-C1 is the only play with a shot at winning. One of the E’s would give me an unstoppable TOOTLED at O5 or 15H. I’m slowly starting to become more aware when an endgame is hopeless even if the score seems close, but I couldn’t bring myself to fish here, hoping to perhaps draw a miracle out-in-one. Maybe next time I’ll do better.
