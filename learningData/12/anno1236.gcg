#note Here's the beginning of the end.  I became so fixated on bingoing that I gave up a really easy win.  I spent a lot of time on this rack, knowing that I know very few 7s or 8s with both C and Y... but I figured I could find a word I knew that I didn't study.  I was looking for -ACY and -ARY words and found nothing.  SORCERY was a desperation play with less than 2 minutes left on my clock.  
>George_Viebranz: ??CERSY --  -77 302
>Daniel_Milton: EH 1N HE +28 353
#note Another shot at it.  I go over on time so much that now it is necessary for me to bingo.  
>George_Viebranz: ??CERSY 14G YaCkERS +73 375
#note Desperation.  Both phonies.  Daniel: "That doesn't take an S either."  Thanks for the tip.

>George_Viebranz: ??CERSY L8 dEC.Y +28 330
#note At this point I was so demoralized and disappointed in myself, I am surprised I even found 28 points.  I was now more than 5 minutes over on my clock, so I actually only scored 270 in the game.
