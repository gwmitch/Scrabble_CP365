#note No need to fish when you can play IDEALIT(Y)-H1.

>Kelly: AEILRST E3 ATELI.RS +66 109
#note REALIST-9F is worth 3 more points. At least I didn’t miss a double-double.

#note Now this felt good, getting down a bingo I wouldn’t have known a month ago. I went with this over HA(E)MATIN-5C because I didn’t want to place the S-hook on the DWS, and thought it better to open up two hotspots rather than one. CP disagrees by 2 percent.

#note Between this and the grooming play COO(N)-B2. I thought 12 points was too much to give up in a close game, and CP for once agrees.
>Gavin_Trefoil: ADEIOUW 5J AUDIO +17 241
>Kelly: AACFNOO 6N FA +26 258
#note Awesome! I gave up 5 points to jump on the easier spot to use, holding an A in reserve for 15A, and CP loves it.

>Kelly: ACMOOTU A14 MA +27 318
#note So much for the lovefest. It was time to clean things up, and it would have only cost me 6 points to play TO(F)U-3J, continuing to hold the A.

#note It turns out OUTCOUNT is one of those stupid OUT-words. I think the dumbest one might be OUTFABLE, but am willing to listen to counter-proposals.

#note Well, I don’t know what happened here. I went though my bingo list: TOLUOLE, UNLOOSE, OUTSOLE, OUTLOVE ... it’s right there on my rack. I still don’t know how that disconnect happened, but it cost me the game. Not an inspiring occurrence a week before your toughest tourney to date.
