#note This rack was the cosmic sign that my tourney was gonna suck.  
>Steve_Ozorio: FILM L4 FILM. +26 54
>Pete: ACEIRUW -IUW +0 22
#note Duck likes CURIAE K1 and CAW 6H.  CURIAE is crazy aggressive, with no leave, and CAW is really defensive with an excellent leave.  If I had to do it again, I'd probably exchange again.

#note The Only playable bingo.
>Steve_Ozorio: AEGNNOT 10H NEGATON +75 150
>Pete: DGJLRRS M9 J.G +19 113
#note Apparently, this is my reward for finding the hi prob bingo.  Duck liked my play, and it won sim, but part of me is partial to exch. DGJLR, which was my other option.
>Steve_Ozorio: AAHY 4D AYAH +27 177
>Pete: DLRRRST -DLRR +0 113
#note Best.
>Steve_Ozorio: KOW J3 WO.K +21 198
>Pete: AEIQRST M3 QA.I +35 148
#note Best.  I considered burning the S for 13 more points with QATS, but being down by so much, I felt I had to keep the S.  Turns out, it was the right choice.
>Steve_Ozorio: ACELLNU -ACE +0 198
>Pete: EPRSTUV O6 PERVS +39 187
#note Duck likes fishy play GUV 11M.  I wanted to score, as his exchange told me he was likely to bingo soon, and I wanted to kill the O column to minimize the damage.  I knew I was pretty much screwed regardless as I watched him work his rack.
>Steve_Ozorio: ??BEENS 12G BENamES +78 276
>Pete: CENRTUU H12 .CRU +18 205
#note I saw UNCUTE 13B, but chickened out.  May play was not the best option equity-wise, but I needed to throw the board open and hope for some love.
>Steve_Ozorio: ABEMR 3A BREAM +27 303
#note This is one of the frustrating moments of the game for me.  He screwed up big.  BREAM/RAYAH is clearly better with those tiles, and putting the B in A column is giving me a free shot.  If there were any justice, I'd have had EENORTU.
>Pete: DEENOTU 14C DEUTE.ON +63 268
#note Best.  Only bingo... With a really good draw, I can come back and win this thing if he doesn't score big on the A column...
>Steve_Ozorio: EELSZ A3 .EZELS +54 357
#note nevermind...
>Pete: AAHOORS B5 AH +37 305
#note Duck likes AHA rather than AH, but I wanted to keep the C column clear for an 8. 
>Steve_Ozorio: EGIINT C8 IGNITE. +22 379
>Pete: AAIOORS 12C .A +4 309
#note  Frustration, panic and idiocy combine to bend me over and make me their bitch.  Duck likes surrendering with AIRS O1, but the real play is IOTA 12A, which sets up the S hook, and gives me a fighting chance at drawing something.  I was fishing for the case L.
>Steve_Ozorio: IILORVX E10 VOX +36 415
>Pete: AIIOORS N2 OI +15 324
#note AIRS best again, but only a minor mistake.
>Steve_Ozorio: DEIIILR 11K RI. +15 430
>Pete: AIORSU O1 AIS +23 347
#note URSA kicks ass here.  I must review the strange 4's.
