#note NUCHALs at C2 is eight more. This is why I sometimes hate bingoing against experts.
>Mike_Baron: DEIKM 1C MI.KED +42 66
>Jason: EFGIIIN 4A FINI.G +28 124
#note To play at 4A or 4C? Naturally, I picked the one championship player disagrees with...
>Mike_Baron: FMU A1 MUF. +36 102
#note ...and I let him clean up his rack and score 36. I'm terrible with extensions, but I see (MUFF)LERS and (MUFF)LING immediately. (So did he, naturally.)
>Jason: AEEGINO H7 O.A +15 139
#note The beginning of a fatal case of FPS. I want to keep the ING combo. In hindsight, AGONE at H11 (which I almost played) is far superior, second to (F)OE at 3A in equity and sim.
>Mike_Baron: ?EIQU H11 EQUId +74 176
#note He said I blocked QUESTION through the T, but so does AGONE. Leaves of NO, NS and OS all have 87+ point bingos, so he "missed" more bingos than me! (fist pump)
>Jason: BEEEGIN I3 BEING +26 165
#note Decide to forget about MUFFLING. BEE at I5 is best.
>Mike_Baron: DEOO C1 .OO.ED +18 194
#note This play really struck me as the difference between the mid-1800s and people like me. He wrings 18 out of an obviously vowel-heavy rack with a find I know I wouldn't have made. I'd have probably been too busy internally whining.
>Jason: AEELORW F10 AWE +21 186
#note Forget MUFFLING; I'm 3/4 of the way to MUFFLERS with four S's unseen! C'mon, Tile Gods, quit mocking me!
>Mike_Baron: ENVY 14F VE.NY +27 221
#note Beautiful board fork.
>Jason: EELOPRR D8 .OPER +18 204
#note Who cares about ELOPER at 15J? I'm leaving LER with four S's unseen! C'mon, I'm trying to beat (and impress) Mike f***ing Baron here, Tile Gods! Daddy needs a new Midas!
>Mike_Baron: ARX C11 RAX +24 245
>Jason: AEILNOR 3I .OA +5 209
#note I hated this play at the time, but only later did Quackle tell me how bad it was. It's time to cut my losses and play down column B (ALOIN, esp. since we're short of E's, is best). I'm trying to bait him away from the MUFF extension and give myself a chance at bingoing (tight board with a bunch of A's, S's and T's unseen drawing into LINER) but the leave doesn't justify scoring 5.
>Mike_Baron: AAGIS B9 SAIGA +24 269
#note OK, only two S's left to draw to.
>Jason: EILNNOR I12 IN. +18 227
#note Another punt. One last chance for MUFFLERS, assuming he plays at A13.
>Mike_Baron: TV K2 T.V +6 275
#note Hopes of bingoing all but dead now.
>Jason: ELNORWZ A8 LEZ +49 276
#note I nearly messed this up by playing WON at A13 to give myself one more chance. Eventually I did the right thing, though. Now that I look at the pool again, with two E's, L's, R's and three S's unseen, he may have been close to MUFFLERS. Part of the reason this game was total frustration: Just played the I, so no WIZ at A13, no Z(AX) play starting at A13, no hope of bingoing after drawing WZ...
>Mike_Baron: AELO A12 ALOE +31 306
#note Beautiful overlap. Running short of vowels now (seven of the 23 unplayed). Good chance he left RS, so maybe I blocked it.
>Jason: LNOPRSW 5H R.PS +26 302
#note Guess what I drew after giving up on MUFFLERS?! grrr... WINS is a lot better (best equity-wise), but I had bad visions of ditching the case N and drawing RR. I really gave away equity in the middle part of this game. SOWN at K5 instead? Championship player gives OWLS at J9 a 31.36 percent chance.
>Mike_Baron: BERSU J8 RUBES +25 331
#note Again, beautiful. Scores, leaves one in the bag, slices, dices, makes julienne fries. The works.
>Jason: HLNOOTW K9 NOH +28 330
#note Best, but no hope of winning. I think no matter what I play the previous turn, I'm done drawing HOT plus whatever.
>Mike_Baron: ADIIRST 2E .ID +17 348
#note DIT at L1 is five better.
>Jason: LOTTW 15J OWL +12 342
#note VOW at 4K or WO at L1 are four better.
>Mike_Baron: AIRST M11 AIRTS +17 365
#note Misses S(T)RAIT or S(T)RATI for 20. It's always disappointing to lose a 20-some point game in which you dump 60-some points of equity. But hey! He told me I played well (hope he doesn't see this or he'll retract the comment), I hung with an 1851 despite drawing three power tiles, no tough decisions about going to Minnesota. No worries. This game, in part, gave me a shot of needed confidence heading into the main event.
>Mike_Baron:  (TT) +4 369
