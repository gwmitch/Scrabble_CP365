#note I noted the fishiness of his play, and then managed to make a play that neither scores, blocks, nor leaves the optimal leave.  My play pretty one day.
>Daniel_Milton: ACDEINS I2 CANDIES +68 76
>Pete: EEIQRTV G5 QI +13 27
#note this and Q(I) 6H are about even as per the Duck.
>Daniel_Milton: KNOW 4H K.OWN +34 110
>Pete: EIORTTV 2I .ORVET +26 53
#note Best.  
>Daniel_Milton: PTU E4 TUP +15 125
>Pete: AAIIRTT K4 .AIT +14 67
#note Sheesh.  I miss (Q)A(D)I 5G.  I'd gladly pay you Tuesday for some board vision today.
>Daniel_Milton: ELRSU 10B RULES +19 144
>Pete: ABIRTVY G8 .Y +22 89
#note obvious fish at an E.  When making it, I was almost sure I was making a huge mistake, but it actually finished second as per Quackle, only 2.1 behind BAY.  Lots of E's unseen, plus 8's.
>Daniel_Milton: AEHMS 8K SHAME +50 194
>Pete: ABILRTV D8 VI.LA +24 113
#note Missed again.  Duck likes VITA D1, which seems insane... opening the 1 Row woth a consonant while holding no vowels?  Villa only sacrifices two points, and gives a vowel to play thru, plus hook possibilities.
>Daniel_Milton: DEN 9M DEN +17 211
>Pete: BEFLORT 7M FET +29 142
#note Dumb miss. FOB 3M clearly best.
>Daniel_Milton: EJO D2 JOE +24 235
>Pete: ABFILOR 3M FOB +28 170
#note Not knowing FRIJOL, FOB worked ok... and FRIJOL was less than 3 points better,  Pretty tho.
>Daniel_Milton: AADEGNR B8 AR.ANGED +70 305
>Pete: AHILRRZ A8 ZA +68 238
#note I missed a bingo here... raise your hand if you found (A)RRHIZAL... had I seen it, I still think ZA is the better play.
>Daniel_Milton: OW A14 WO +29 334
>Pete: HILNORR 3B RH. +12 250
#note wanted to fish at a reasonable rack... RHINO had a win % of 1.5 or so, all other options below 1%.  Dumb error on my part...
>Daniel_Milton: CEU B1 EC.U +12 346
>Pete: IILNORS 13D SIRLOIN +68 318
#note which worked out as I catch perfect.
>Daniel_Milton: INY H12 Y.NI +33 379
>Pete: ?DGILPT O7 ...D +5 323
#note another place where I don't understand the duck.  It likes G(E)D, and says it wins nearly 50% of games.  Any reasonable block kills me.  My play sets up an S hook and draws at 3 unseen Es for PIGLETs the A for PLAITING, or the blank. Doesn't guarantee a win... a big X play kills me, still.
>Daniel_Milton: U J13 .U +4 383
#note I'd imagine that there's a better block out there.  Don't know his rack tho.  
>Pete: ?EGILPT 11I PIGLETs +73 396
#note Yahtzee!  I hit... now I need the X or the ? to be the last tile in the bag.
>Daniel_Milton: ?AEEIRT 15J TRIAgE +21 404
>Pete: X J10 X. +25 421
#note And I should have bought a lottery ticket.  I gave myself the chance, and I was happy with my over the board analysis.
>Pete:  (E) +2 423
