>Mark_Kenas: AEEW H6 AWEE +14 14
>Jason: AACDILO G6 LOAD +23 23
#note OK, I think, now we're starting to play defense.
>Mark_Kenas: ?AILORU F1 UxORIAL +69 83
#note His only playable bingo. Toto, we aren't in Division 2 any more... He (and I) scored it as 70.
>Jason: ACEIOOS 4D OO.IE +12 35
#note Q likes OI at F9. Drawing into three vowels, a consonant and an S is fraught with peril, but the pool's so consonant-heavy now, it's not that big a risk.
>Mark_Kenas: ?EKNRSY 1D Yo.NKERS +104 187
#note There's a clothing/department store (IIRC) called Younkers in West Michigan. So now I have their commercial jingle ("Come to the right place: Younkers and Elder Beerman") stuck in my head.
>Jason: ACDFNSY -  +0 35
#note On the way back from the challenge computer, he said "I thought it might be British," so it wasn't a horrible challenge. I mean, I'm thinking "game over" at this point. Put it this way: If I play FANCY for 36, my win percentage is like between 3 and 4.
>Mark_Kenas: MM E3 M.M +26 213
>Jason: ACDFNSY E7 FANCY +36 71
#note By the way, I (heart) the play off four, draw four vowels, play off four, draw four consonants sequence.
>Mark_Kenas: FGO I9 FOG +22 235
>Jason: ABDEIST H11 ABIDE +36 107
#note Totally choked by missing the open R for REDBAITS. My excuse is that I was trying to avoid looking at YOUNKERS for sanity's sake. :)
>Mark_Kenas: AZ D8 ZA +44 279
#note Yeah, not looking good for the home team here.
>Jason: DGNQSTU 13G Q. +21 128
#note QU(I)D is better, esp. with plenty of unseen I's.
>Mark_Kenas: ITT J7 TIT +11 290
>Jason: DGNSTTU C9 GUT +12 140
#note I'm thinking of how, way behind vs. Winter in Rocky River, I made a similar play, only to watch him ZA me for 64 two turns later in my 255-point loss. But, gotta try to make something happen at this point.
>Mark_Kenas: AEI 14F AI.E +18 308
>Jason: DEINSTX B10 XI +52 192
#note The gamble pays off. Up to a .97% win percentage here. Get on board, the comeback train's pulling out of the station!
>Mark_Kenas: EELPS A11 SPEEL +33 341
>Jason: DENSTUV 8J .NVEST +39 231
#note Best, but a win percentage of .39% now. BTW, I (heart) playing off two and drawing UV. Did it twice against Anstandig at club on my birthday, and once here. What can I say? My future's so bright I need to wear shades!
>Mark_Kenas: B 3E ..B +17 358
>Jason: CDEGINU O4 EDUC.ING +63 294
#note That's EDUCTING*. He let it go, perhaps because I had (S)EDUCING by PLAYING THE LETTERS IN THE SAME F***ING ORDER! Sheesh. I'm hoping to draw the case D while in the bag.
>Mark_Kenas: AP 7M PA. +19 377
#played PE(C), looked at the tracking sheet, saw only two E's were out, played PA(C). At least I know I can't play my E for anything less than a bingo.
>Jason: DEHILOS J7 ...H +28 322
#note Choke job no. 2. I knew this wasn't good, but I wanted it to be good so badly, I made it good. Pissed all over the good post-bingo draw.
>Jason: DEHILOS --  -28 294
#note Took about three seconds.
>Mark_Kenas: ORT J13 ORT +13 390
#note On the bright side, I'm pretty sure he's not considering the EDUCTING front hook, given how easy it is to block and how he's blocking everywhere else but that.
>Jason: DEHILOS B14 HO +22 316
#note If I'd had an ounce of patience, seen this and TITH* were comparable ... ugh. But I still ain't quittin'!
>Mark_Kenas: EH J7 ...HE +33 423
#note I sure hope he saw this before my error.
>Jason: ADEILNS 3I SNAILED +82 398
#note Yahtzee! However, I have no win now. (PE)NALISED, however, apparently has a couple theoretical wins.
>Mark_Kenas: INORTUV 2A VINO +19 442
#note VI(E)R blocks JEW and leaves the unblockable UNTO at 2A, making it 15 points better, but Mark was in deep time trouble.
>Jason: JRRW N2 J.W +31 429
#note CBB asked after the game if I could've won by not phonying and playing HO first. Well, if I play HO I'm down 62. Assuming Mark plays TITHE, I'm down 95 with seven in the bag. SNAILED gets me within 13. Down 13, Mark on strike, seven on seven, assume I have the J, he's in time trouble ... I dunno. It would've been more interesting than the endgame we had, which was over in like 10 seconds after he played VINO.
>Mark_Kenas: RTU 11L TRU. +5 447
>Mark_Kenas:  (RR) +4 451
