>Cesar: ACDHOSU 8G DUH +14 14
#note [-1] thought of OUCH, but didn't know where to place it, and didn't see HOCUS, but really is HOCUS better than DUH? it's close.
>James: HOW 9H HOW +21 21
>Cesar: ACNOOSU 10I NOO +18 32
#note NOHOW is better. [-4]
>James: DEOPUV 11D UPDOVE +31 52
>Cesar: ACNRRSU G5 CUR. +8 40
#note i saw CURRANS, chickened out on it, didn't want to play something like that on james. i need to study my words better!! [-40] Also, this is probably the worst fish, I had to add it to the list and it was dead last. BOOOO! I don't know about 12A CURN though. or (V)ARUS or 12I RUN.. these all seem weird.

>James: IMRY O12 .IMY +27 115
>Cesar: CEGIOTZ M11 Z.IC +30 144
#note this is tough..M11 COZIE seems to win but that seems dumb. so does DITZ. i don't know what's right here, but I' trust quackle for now. [-5] 13G GITE actually makes sense so i might go with that.

#note right word, wrong spot. L10! [-8]

#note i refuse to give myself that much equity loss. i don't see any triple-triples, but i don't know my words enough to not freak out. apparently, this move only has a 91% chance of winning, almost everything else has a 100% chance! i actually logged the data to a file with quackle, and started going through it -- and several moves have him bingoing out with TOLERATE 3G. THAT STILL DOESN'T WIN! what's quackle talking about?
