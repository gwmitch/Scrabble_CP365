>Mark_Przybyszewski: AEHLO 8D HAOLE +24 24
>Pete: ?HRRUWY D8 .URRY +22 22
#note The duck prefers AWRY E8 by 0.6, but I still prefer mine.  I'll go to war early on with ?HW on an open board.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AEFM 9F FAME +23 47
>Pete: ?ADHORW J6 WARD +27 49
#note I missed DORHAWk (oh well) and HA(R)ROWeD (less excusable, but still).  But my pick was just bad.  even missing the bingoes, DHOW J9 is clearly best
>Mark_Przybyszewski: BEGLU K2 BUGLE +21 68
>Pete: ?ADHILO 4F HIDAL.Os +78 127
#note Best.  
>Mark_Przybyszewski: LOX 3E LOX +40 108
>Pete: EENORTU 8J .OUTER +21 148
#note Duck likes ROUEN 2B... only a minor miss equity-wise, but from a board control standpoint, far superior to ROUTER
>Mark_Przybyszewski: IPRV N5 VIP.R +12 120
>Pete: EIKNOOT 2K .OOK +20 168
#note KOTO M6 requires a modicum of board vision, so naturally I missed it (4 pts. of equity lost).  I preferred keeping the E to the six points for EBOOK.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: FI 10D .IF +31 151
>Pete: ADEINTT 11B DI.T +14 182
#note Big error.  DIRT doesn't even make the list.  Duck likes the fish of TA 7F.  I liked opening the board, but had I been paying attention, I'd have taken TA.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: IPU 3M PIU +24 175
>Pete: AAENNTV 2D VAN +18 200
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EN J1 NE +17 192
>Pete: ACEINNT B4 INCANTE. +69 269
#note A real decision here.  I saw and considered the other available bingo, (U)NCINATE. But with Mark fishing, and only a three point difference, INCANTED made much more sense.  Sim bore my decision out.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: EIMNRST L8 .NMITERS +72 264
>Pete: ?DEEIOY A7 YE +26 295
#note Best.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: QT I3 Q.T +22 286
>Pete: ?DEIOSZ 14J ZO.IS +68 363
#note I missed the f'ing sweet 9 for 113 D(EM)OnIZES, and DOZINESS.  I saw a number of bingoes, IODIZERs and IDOLIZES, but I thought that 68 while keeping E? made more sense.  Sim liked the choice over the bingoes I saw.
>Mark_Przybyszewski: AGJS A1 JAGS +42 328
>Pete: ?ABDEET 11H BEAD.EsT +70 433
#note My ZORIS is rewarded with a nice draw (out of an admittedly friendly bag), and it's all over but the endgame. Missed better bingoes on the 15 row, JETBEADS (didn't know) and BESTEADS (didn't bother to look).
>Mark_Przybyszewski: CEGINOS 1L NOSE +30 358
#note Pretty play, wins sim.
>Pete: AEW 1G WEA. +21 454
