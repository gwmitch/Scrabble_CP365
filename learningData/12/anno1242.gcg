>Pete: ACIIRSS H6 RAI +6 6
#notes I hate hate HATE racks like this with no play that is better than awful.  Duck likes ASCI.  I couldn't make myself burn an ess for so few points.
>Chris_Lipe: BHO G7 HOB +26 26
>Pete: CDINSSW 10C WINDS +22 28
#note Best.
>Chris_Lipe: DEIT I4 TIED +18 44
>Pete: CIKLNST D8 CL.NK +28 56
#note About even with LICK F5; I like the better rack balance (IST) of CLINK as opposed to LICK (NST).
>Chris_Lipe: EFU J6 FEU +36 80
>Pete: EEILSTV H1 VILE +27 83
#note Inexcusable. I saw the sevens (except LIEVEST, which I blanked on), I did not see the front hook of HADE.  I am a moron.
>Chris_Lipe: ILO E10 .OIL +18 98
>Pete: EFGNSST K4 FETS +30 113
>Chris_Lipe: EVX L3 VEX +45 143
>Pete: EEGHNSY 14C GEY +15 128
#note For some reason, I got paranoid when he played NOIL about him having a Y.  I was so obsessed with blocking the spot for no good reason that I missed the far better HEY.
>Chris_Lipe: AEIM 8A AMI.E +27 170
>Pete: ?BEHNST A8 .BSiNTHE +89 217
#note Had to play what I did, but some of the sevens on the rack (HENBITS, BENTHOS) are so much cooler.
>Chris_Lipe: AGUZ E4 GAUZ. +30 200
>Pete: EGNOPRT 4A PRON. +22 239
#note Duck hated this play far more than I expected... 13 behind GORP F3.
>Chris_Lipe: AJU A1 JAU. +39 239
>Pete: AEGIOTT -AGIOT +0 239
#note I can deal with the exchange being suboptimal, since I was not going to find TRITOMA B3.
>Chris_Lipe: ?ELORSY 1D fLYO.ERS +63 302
#note not the best bingo... Duck likes not bingoing here (OY B1 by 9.5 pts.), but who cares?  It's a beautiful find.
>Pete: ADEMOTT F5 AM +22 261
#note Duck likes OW, but with an A heavy bag, doubling the A would make my life very difficult.
>Chris_Lipe: OW B1 OW +29 331
>Pete: AADEOTT 7B AT +10 271
#note So I draw AA.  sheesh. and then miss ADIT F1... I suck.
>Chris_Lipe: IP F12 PI +15 346
>Pete: ADEOORT 6A OD +17 288
#note Best.
>Chris_Lipe: EO 2E OE +13 359
>Pete: ADEIORT 3L .ET +12 300
#note I was waiting/hoping for Chris to dump the last unseen O.  I was saving VET for that point.  ADIOR is not optimal... but it beats SATIRE? without a place to play it.
>Chris_Lipe: AQ N1 QA. +24 383
>Pete: ADINORR O1 ID +45 345
#note Duck says just play the I for 33, and it's right.  ID for 45 concedes the game, in essence.
>Chris_Lipe: ACEGINU C2 AG.N +16 399
>Pete: ANORRRT M2 R.T +13 358
#note Altho the 3rd R woulda been bad either way.  I spent a lot of time on the endgame here, and while not perfect, I did see the possibility of the I stick, and I pulled it off.
