#note Quackle doesn't think too highly of this play.  I missed XYLAN and UNSAY, but am surprised this ranks lower than YAULD for 24.  I would have thought AS was a better leave than NS and 4 for more points.  Or DUN for 2 more with a ALSY leave.

#note I didn't see INVALIDS, and guessed EXURBIA took an S since so many nouns do.  For 93 points I figured it was worth a shot, and it was.
