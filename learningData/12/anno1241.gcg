>Vince_Castellano: BIM 8G MIB +14 14
>Pete: AFIIKNR 9F KIF +21 21
#note Missing KAFIR as a pretty underlap.  I get too lazy on opening racks.  I chickened out on the much cooler FIRKIN... I learned it from the name of a chain of bars in Ontario, but thought it was a made up word.
>Vince_Castellano: ARV 10E VAR +21 35
>Pete: ADDINNR 7H DARN +18 39
#note Thank you for reentering Division 3.  The Staircase is on the left.  Duck likes DAN by .6, so it's a wash on equity. I wanted the extra tile of turnover and opening the board, and I was willing to sacrifice first shot at the triple on Row 7.  
>Vince_Castellano: EEHISWY -EEHISW +0 35
>Pete: BDILNOU K2 BUNIO. +16 55
#note And having no idea that UNBID is good, I miss the play to use said triple.  BUNION is just bad.  I was obsessed with killing Row 8... heck, UNION setting up the hook woulda been better, almost.
>Vince_Castellano: DEINRRT 3G INTR.DER +72 107
#note When I exchange, my rack doesn't appreciably improve, He exchanges six into a hi prob bingo.  This is my tourney, in a nutshell.  
>Pete: ADEGILO 2A GEOIDAL +74 129
#note Of course, now my hi prob bingo plays, so it's not all bad.
>Vince_Castellano: EOOZ 4D OOZE +29 136
>Pete: AACEOUU A1 A.UE +18 147
#note And then back to drawing dreck.  EAU 5E is significantly better, but requires the board vision of an 1100, so I naturally missed it.
>Vince_Castellano: EIILMST 11G ELITISM +74 210
>Pete: ACGOTTU L8 COA.T +20 167
#note I thought COAST was OK, boy does the Duck disagree.  GAMUT is almost 10 equity points better.  For some reason, I always miss GAMUT.  Many other better plays though.
>Vince_Castellano: AEJ L1 JA.E +48 258
>Pete: GIOPTTU N2 G.OUT +16 183
#note Why play GROUP for more points and a better leave when you can play GROUT?  At this point, the last four plays were causing me to lose composure a little bit.
>Vince_Castellano: AEORVW O6 AVOWER +38 296
>Pete: EEEHIPT M9 HE. +23 206
#note I had never heard of LETHE.  I have now.  
>Vince_Castellano: FHNO 5B FOHN +29 325
>Pete: EEILPTU 1G PULI +24 230
#note LETUP woulda been nice to the triple.
>Vince_Castellano: CP C1 C.P +14 339
>Pete: ?ADEEST 13I yEASTED +72 302
#note.  DEAREST woulda been better scorewise, but I wanted to keep the board as open as I could; I figured I might need another bingo, and the unseen pool had great bingo potential...
>Vince_Castellano: ?AEINRY 14D INlAYER +66 405
#note Which he proceeds to take advantage of.  Interestingly enough, INLAYER, and all other bingoes, sim badly.  
>Pete: GNQSSXY D13 Q. +11 313
#note So now, I get the power tiles.  Lovely. I spent 6 minutes on this, and still F'ed it up this badly.  I had him tracked right... I missed the spot for WELT at 15I; I thought his only out was 15A.  Turns out, OWLET was there too.  Naturally, had I realized he had the out, SEXY N12 was my play.
>Vince_Castellano: ELTW 15I WELT +16 421
>Vince_Castellano:  (GNSSXY) +34 455
