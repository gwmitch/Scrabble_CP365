>MarkS: ABEU 8G BEAU +12 12
>Jason: ADIINSV K2 AVIDINS +79 79
#note had I seen it I might have opted for the 4 overlap placement for 76; however, just going for the points sims best by a point.
>MarkS: ADELORS 9C ORDEALS +71 83
>Jason: INSTTTZ 8A ZIT +38 117
#note the mistake.  Quackle prefers 6j Z(I)T for 32.  Keeping a vowel seems to be important enough to ditch 6 points.  I considered and (rightly) rejected ZITIS for 48.
>MarkS: DGOP 2J P.GOD +30 113
>Jason: EENSTTU E2 UNTESTE. +68 185
#note the two placements are pretty much equivalent.  Only bingo.
>MarkS: AKO J4 OAK +38 151
>Jason: EMNORTU 5A ROUT.MEN +60 245
#note only bingo again.
>MarkS: JO 10B JO +28 179
>Jason: ?ACEEHM O1 MACHEtE +111 356
#note I saw MACHrEE as well during the game but since they both take S I decided to not put a vowel by the TLS.  Turns out these are the only bingos.
>MarkS: FIS 8M IFS +60 239
>Jason: ADEIPRW H1 PRAW. +42 398
>MarkS: EILLRWY A1 ILLE. +18 257
>Jason: DEGINTU N8 .EUDING +28 426
#note The fast player likes (J)UDGE to begin with, but FEUDING sims best by quite a bit.  Who needs all those hooks when I have none of them?  More non-gos.  Talk about drawing synergistically.
>MarkS: ABEL 11K BLA.E +16 273
>Jason: ?EINOTY 6C NO.Y +34 460
#note I spent a lot of time here looking for bingos and eventually bailed out with NOSY.  Turns out that I missed nothing, though I was a bit paranoid.
>MarkS: OX 3K .OX +47 320
>Jason: ?EFHIRT 13G FRIgHTE. +86 546
#note the first bingos I saw were REFIGHT/FIGHTER/FREIGHT so I was primed to look with the G.  Surprisingly (at least to me) this was the only bingo available.
>MarkS: GOW H12 G.OW +30 350
>Jason: CIINRVY M5 RIC.N +14 560
#note yay!  I found the out in 2, with VINY and JIVY both available. Before I found QAT I thought he might have to play Q(U)A and leave me VINY/QI/AY but then I found AQUA blocking that, and then the obvious QAT.  Duh :)
