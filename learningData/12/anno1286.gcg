>Jason: BERSSUU 8G RUB +10 10
#note WTH kind of word is RUBUS? Q likes passing U ... is the BUSSER leave that good?
>Jon_Shreve: EVX 7F VEX +26 26
>Jason: AEEGSSU J5 AGUE +15 25
#note Quackle and I will argue about playing off the second S for minimal points until the end of time, I think.
>Jon_Shreve: AAH K3 AAH +22 48
>Jason: DELNOSS L1 DOLES +28 53
#note A "where was my brain then?" moment: I punch the rack in, and go "Why didn't I play BOLDNESS? I think I saw BOLDNESS and chickened out. WTH did I chicken out on BOLDNESS; it's a f***ing common word!" If I get that down, maybe it's a different game.
>Jon_Shreve: AIIMR 1J MI.AIR +27 75
>Jason: GNOORST J1 .OG +12 65
#note I don't know if I should know TROGONS or not. I'm guessing no.
>Jon_Shreve: AACEI 9C AECIA +13 88
>Jason: LMNORST 8A NOM +19 84
#note Quackle likes plays like MELTON, MELON, MERLOT, etc. at D8. Maybe if I'd done that, I could've fixed my consonantitis before it became fatal. This game was full of ifs.
>Jon_Shreve: DD 2L .DD +19 107
#note He scored this as 18; I didn't check it.
>Jason: BGILRST 10A BIG +14 98
#note BL(AHS) is pretty cute. And Q's play.
>Jon_Shreve: DEOPRST 11C SPORTED +77 184
>Jason: ELRSSTT E9 .L.T +6 104
#note Hey, now we were catching up on our consonant playing! I thought the odds of drawing a vowel here were in my favor.
>Jon_Shreve: FI 12G IF +20 204
#note He said he drew four I's after the bingo. Never would've guessed by his ensuing plays. (Meanwhile, I see all these unseen I's and think I'm close to the SISTER stem.)
>Jason: CERRSST H10 R..ERS +27 131
#note Nope, no vowel. Chickened out on R(EF)ECT.
>Jon_Shreve: EITY D11 .IETY +32 236
>Jason: ?CEOSTW 15A COW. +36 167
#note missed CROWNETS, CROWSTEP. Best of the non-bingos.
>Jon_Shreve: LZ 13G L.Z +27 263
>Jason: ?EKNOST 13B OK. +14 181
#note I couldn't believe I couldn't find a bingo. I must've spent five minutes on this rack. I was glad there's only one playable bingo to miss: STENOKY.
>Jon_Shreve: EIILNOT A1 LENITIO. +77 340
>Jason: ?AEFNST 10H .eFASTEN +72 253
#note RAFTSmEN two rows below is 97. Didn't know that one, either.
>Jon_Shreve: IQU O7 QUI. +39 379
#note Dammit, I can't extend it to QUININELA*. Exact same spot on the board, though!
>Jason: EEHNTUW I2 HEW +21 274
>Jon_Shreve: AEV 14F VE.A +30 409
#note He said the blank was one of the last two left after this play.
>Jason: EJNNOTU H1 JO +33 307
#note This is the right play ... after UN(S)ENT.
>Jon_Shreve: ?ANPRY 15H .PRAY +28 437
>Jason: ENNTU O7 ....TE +16 323
#note Hey, I've already blown 150 points of equity, what's another 14?
