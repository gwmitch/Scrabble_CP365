>Jason: AEEORTU 8G EAU +6 6
#note Quackle seems to like passing EOU.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EFW 7E FEW +22 22
>Jason: AENORST 6D SENATOR +76 82
#note Yeah, I drew ANS into EORT. It was that kind of tournament. Note to self: Check for double-doubles next time instead of going "Ooh, what overlaps can I make?"
>Martin_Weisskopf: EQR I5 R.Q.E +25 47
>Jason: FHILORT 10F FROTH +42 124
#note The five options (FILTH, FIRTH, FORTH, FRITH, FORTH; and try saying that list fives time fast!) are about equal.
>Martin_Weisskopf: EOV 5I .OVE +16 63
#note Martin made a comment like "It better get better in a hurry" as he played this, but I knew I wasn't out of the woods yet.
>Jason: ?EIILOT F9 I. +5 129
#note Very frustrating that no bingoes played.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ?ENOSSY K7 SENSOrY +80 143
#note Incredibly, Martin can play SENSORY for 99. See where?
>Jason: ?AEILOT 12D vIOLATE. +64 193
#note I had a feeling while in the bag that I'd pull an A. That kind of tournament. Wanted to throw the V in the open quadrant. Not kicking myself over missing ALOETIc/c(ROQUET) for 15 more.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ADIP M2 PAID +23 166
>Jason: DEIIIIS 13K .ID +14 207
#note FPS rears its ugly head. Want to give myself an -S hook. I figure if I pass III, even if I get a dream draw like ART, it won't be easy to bingo and then I'm not scoring much two turns in a row in a race situation. I'm figuring YID, pass, bingo and I'm in control. Just out-thought myself.
>Martin_Weisskopf: CLMUY 2I CLUM.Y +34 200
#note Said his leave was AR in the post mortem. Regardless, a good way to score and clear drek.
>Jason: BEIIIKS 8A BIKES +42 249
#note Nearly made a mistake and played BI at 1N. Then I remembered how badly I outbingoed opponents in Elyria and still finished with a way negative spread/Cesar talking about "playing for the bingo" too much. No blanks or S's left, only four E's, very little chance for him to bingo, even through an I. J, X and Z unseen. RUN!!! So I did.
>Martin_Weisskopf: BJ E11 J.B +24 224
>Jason: DHIINUZ D3 ZIN. +26 275
#note Crap, no E. At least the racing to the good stuff worked.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AIN 3B NA.I +26 250
>Jason: DEHIOTU 14B OUTED +33 308
#note How do I miss the (should be) easy to find bingo? I'm in race mode. Score and block, score and block, score and block. I'm so relieved to have the E; I can block! -ED words score; can I use the H (yes, with THOUED, which I didn't know)? Never even considered that I might have a bingo myself. Spent more time wondering how badly plays down column A, making ROUTED or TOUTED, could hurt me. If I'd lost because of this, I'd have secluded myself in a HIDEOUT permanently. :)
>Martin_Weisskopf: LLRT B6 TR.LL +9 259
#note "Not looking good for the home team," Martin (a Cubs fan) said. I was able to give a little sigh of relief here, given my rack.
>Jason: ACEHIRV A12 HIRE +40 348
#note Thought about VERA (best play), but liked threatening VAC/C(ROQUET). For whatever reason, didn't notice that VERA threatens HIC/C(ROQUET). (Again, why am I at Table 1 playing for the championship?) 
>Martin_Weisskopf: DEMO 15E DOME +39 298
>Jason: ACGNTVX 8K .XACT +66 414
#note Like I said, keep AC hoping to draw the TX. Keep up with my genius here, peeps! (Seriously, I nearly missed this. No matter, I can enter celebration mode now.) For the record, this is one of two plays where my play matches Championship Player's best play.
>Martin_Weisskopf: P C2 P. +4 302
>Jason: AGGGINV C13 V.G +14 428
#note "Sure, NOW you have a bad rack!" Martin says in a bit of gallows humor.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AAENORU O6 OU.EARN +8 310
>Jason: AGGINW 4L W.NG +30 458
#note And this is the other. Even I can't mess this up.
>Martin_Weisskopf: A C8 .A +10 320
>Martin_Weisskopf:  (AGI) +8 328
