#note I didn't know BENNET.

#note I loved this play, even if it blocked a 102-point play for me.  Whether this was good or not, I didn't know... but I didn't think he was making it up, and I had at least 30 tpoints in return.  
>George_Viebranz: ADEIKNS 15D .ANKED +33 53
#note My anamonic (though I didn't make it up) for the RANDIES eights is "SUV BELONGED TO GREENSPAN"... I thought it might be funny to get one of those down, but I took the 4th or 5th best play.  There is a bingo from the B that I didn't know.

#note Missed InITIA(L)S.  This was 2nd.

#note No-brainer.
>Randy_Greenspan: AGRUU 7G AUGUR +14 150
>George_Viebranz: ?AGNOOS K4 GAd.OONS +82 190
#note almost did lAGOONS 12H.  Find a play, find a better play.  I have no idea how I know this word.
>Randy_Greenspan: ADLLO L1 ALLOD +23 173
>George_Viebranz: CDEJRTY 1J TR.YED +30 220
#note I was deciding between this and TR(A)CED.  I played TR(A)YED because it was 3 more points and I figured TR(A)YED had would be slightly less extendable than TR(A)CED.  The only problem is that TRAYED* is not good.  He leaves it though.

#note Best despite the stool-like leave.
>Randy_Greenspan: DEORSSW O4 WORS.EDS +66 290
#note I held him for a few seconds here.  
>George_Viebranz: ACEEGIY J3 YAG +16 302
#note Not even on the list.  Best is GIE J9.  I didn't see (HAEM)I(N).
>Randy_Greenspan: AIQU E4 QUAI. +28 318
>George_Viebranz: CEEINOT F3 CINE +25 327
#note last U was still unseen.  He told me later that he had FI(Q)UE if I didn't block.
>Randy_Greenspan: BI J9 BI +23 341
#note Another great play.
>George_Viebranz: EENOOTX L11 OXEN +24 351
#note Best.
>Randy_Greenspan: CEFINSU K13 FEU +28 369
#note This was the beginning of the end for Randy.  Either CUIF or ENUF M10 give him a sure win.  CUIF is 40 points and ENUF is 36.  Either one of them leaves him with ES(TRAYED) if not an out.  I missed that too.  The worst I saw was something like FUN M13 or something else in that spot for 24.  So even this 28 scared me, until I saw what it gave me. 
>George_Viebranz: EIOT M11 TIE +30 381
#note with either CUIF or ENUF, I don't have nearly enough of a reply.  This puts me up 11 and I'm out in one more.  
>Randy_Greenspan: CINS N13 SIC +17 386
#note if he did CIN(E) 14A, then I win by only 1.
