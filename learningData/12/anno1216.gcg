>Kelly: CEILNWX K7 C.LEX +28 28
#note Quackle always seems to want me to ditch the X ASAP, then the time that I do it, it says the top two plays are C(O)WL and (O)WL. Make up your mind, you damned duck! At least CULEX was third.

>Terry_Funk: ACDERTZ 6G D.TZ +34 67
>Kelly: EHHIIWY 2E WHI.Y +22 136
#note I now know you can spell it WHINEY, too. WHINY comes in a tie for second with WHI(Z), holding the Y for possible OXY plays. I considered just playing WHI(N) for that reason, but if Terry has an O that’s likely going to be gone next turn.
>Terry_Funk: ACELOOR L10 COO +25 92
>Kelly: AEFHIIP 13L PHI +24 160
#note I hated this play when I made it, but it still came out on top of the sim. Maybe that’s a step to improvement, being able to make a play even if it’s going against your natural tendencies.
>Terry_Funk: AAEJLRT G4 JA.E +30 122
>Kelly: AEFIILN 14M IF +25 185
#note Hated it again, and again it’s on top. I would have played the second choice, FIN(I)AL-N10 if I had been certain it was good, or the awesome FEI(JO)A-4D had noticed it.
>Terry_Funk: ?AEKLRT 15G RATLiKE +101 223
#note That sucks.
>Kelly: AAEILNQ 1A LIANA +23 208
#note Should have just dumped the Q for 10 and moved on. It might have been worth grabbing points if I could keep an I or A with it, but this is just asking for trouble.
>Terry_Funk: DEEIRUU 14B UREIDE +24 247
>Kelly: ABEOPQR 13E BOP +25 233
#note I really should have seen BARQ(U)E-B10, or stopped being stubborn and dump the Q.
>Terry_Funk: AERRTUY 3A YURTA +22 269
>Kelly: AEEGQRS B13 Q.A +12 245
#note CP says just dumping the Q is better than playing off the A with it, to the point that xch Q was second choice.
>Terry_Funk: EEFGNOR O14 FE +24 293
>Kelly: DEEGRSV E11 RE..D +16 261
#note Ever wonder what sort of play can cut your win percentage by 17? Here it is. I was trying to open things up, but top choice is G(A)ED-15A by a large margin.
>Terry_Funk: EGINORS M2 REGIONS +75 368
>Kelly: BDEEGSV 4J VEG.ED +28 289
#note Again, trying to open more lanes and score enough that a bingo will actually matter. Top option is V(E)G-12D, which I really don’t like at all; seems like an invitation to a human player to happily shut down the rest of the board and coast to the win.

#note The proverbial snowball in hell.
>Terry_Funk: AIMNNST O1 MIN.S +24 406

#note At least I got the final play right!
