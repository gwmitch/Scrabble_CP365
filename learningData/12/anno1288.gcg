>Jason: AENPPRT 8G PAP +14 14
#note WTH kind of word is PETNAP? "Trying to use smear tactics?" Sam asked.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AHIO J5 OHIA +23 23
>Jason: AELNRRT 5E REALT.R +28 42
#note I think Sam said something like "Kids today ... no respect for bingo tiles." I'm not sure if I heard correctly/if he was joking or not. Anyway, it's my best play, so who cares?
>Sam_Kantimathi: EIOWZ 4A ZOWIE +56 79
#note Somebody tell Carol Rav.
>Jason: ADGKMNT 3B DAK +35 77
#note Thus begins my tour de force, or, more accurately, tour de luckbox.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?ADEFSU K8 SnAFUED +79 158
>Jason: EEGIMNT 10F GEMIN.TE +67 144
#note Nearly one of those "where was my brain then?" moments. I knew while waiting for Sam to play that I had GEMINATE - A, assuming I couldn't play MEETING/TEEMING. Then he gave me the A and I forgot. I almost played GEM at 6D!
>Sam_Kantimathi: GMU 2A GUM +28 186
#note Sam said he debated between CUM, GUM and HUM in that spot.
>Jason: DEEINOR A4 .ONER +42 186
#note I'm pulling D's at opportune times, obviously. Q likes ZEROED with this second; I disagree. But maybe I'm overvaluing the GEMINATED spot.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ?CEEHIL B8 ELEnCHI +78 264
>Jason: BDEIORS N8 DISROBE +88 274
#note Q likes BORIDES/(GEMINATE)D instead. I don't. If you're gonna make the board dangerous, made it doubly dangerous so you can whack him back after he whacks you. Of course, this attitude probably contributed to my 455 opponent average after 16 rounds.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AGIL H1 GLIA. +21 285
>Jason: ANQRRST 3G Q.NTARS +54 328
#note Of course, this is the negative aspect; you could have nothing in either spot. Nearly played QI, then "Oh, QINTAR gives me more opportunities to draw vowels" then "Oh, that S will hit the double word! Yahtzee!" Thanks for the I, Sam.
>Sam_Kantimathi: DIT O12 DIT +17 302
#note Beautiful play. Obviously a garbage rack, but gives himself a chance at major points later. If I play there, the bingo line stays open.
>Jason: AENNORY M12 YON +32 360
#note Didn't want to take a chance on DISROBER. This doesn't really block the spot that well. Like I said, my one hiccup.
>Sam_Kantimathi: BOTU 2K BOUT +20 322
>Jason: AEINORV O4 VIREO +45 405
#note I had Sam in time trouble (he insta-played BOUT), and totally forgot the "order of a turn" procedure in the rule book, grabbing the tile bag as soon as I made the play. Sam called me on it. Oops.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EIOTV H10 .OTIVE +36 358
>Jason: ACJNNSX 6E AX +53 458
#note Was nice to pull the case three power tiles on my last draw.
>Sam_Kantimathi: AWY 1M WAY +35 393
#note OK, I need help here. I have Sam playing WAY for 36 to give him 395. But all legitimate ways to play WAY make the ensuing endgame impossible. I seem to recall C(OR)NS being impossible after he made his play, so this is my best guess. I can't believe I would miss a phony three there! I'm almost 100% certain the board is configured correctly. Sam, are you out there? (For the record, WAEFUL/W(AX) is best, Q says.)
