#note It was clear to me that the best long play with this rack was ANLACE.  That would have been Rod's choice, and sim favors it by 7 over this play.  However, I am quite sure that Joey Mallick would like my play better.  To me it just feels wrong to burn through so much good synergy for only 22 points on the opening play.
>Rod_MacNeil: ADGU 9E GAUD +10 10
#note Interesting that he sacrificed a point by not playing this at G8.  Maybe he didn't want to create all the back hooks for GAE when it was a pretty clear read that I was close to a bingo.

>Rod_MacNeil: ABEK 4D B.EAK +32 42
>Dave_Koenig: AEEJRTZ H1 JER. +45 121
#note It made sense to me to sacrifice six points here to keep the Z instead of the J.  Z is much more versatile and likely to allow me to score more on the next play than the J would.
>Rod_MacNeil: AEOSV 5H SOAVE +32 74
>Dave_Koenig: AEEOOTZ L1 ZOEA. +48 169
#note Just think about how much worse shape I woulda been in on this turn if I had J instead of Z.

>Dave_Koenig: EGINOST J5 .G +7 176
#note This is clearly a fishing rack, but Quack prefers GO 7H by 5.5.  The duck is probably right on this one.

#note I missed a bingo here.  Can you find it?

#note Clever move: probably trimming his rack for a bingo, and also setting up a ridiculously high scoring X spot.
>Dave_Koenig: ?EINPRT 14C INTER.aP +67 466
#note This seemed like the best way to bingo, to make it as hard as possible for him to bingo back.  Sure enough, he told me afterwards that I blocked one.
