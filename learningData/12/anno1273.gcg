>Marci: AENOTZ 8D ZONATE +50 50
#note I immediately note the hooks: O- and -D. But no S. I can't WAIT to draw an O!
>Matthew: CEIKTVX 9G XI +36 36
#note EXIT is better. I was trying to soften the blow of a CKV leave with some one-pointers. I need to consider the score more.
>Marci: ABER D8 .EBRA +32 82
#note I immediately note the possibility of ZEBRAS + S. This board is shaping up to become pretty fun.
>Matthew: CEKRTUV 10F RECK +27 63
#note (-11.9) VET in the same spot. Keeping UV is a no-no.
>Marci: AAWY 11I AWAY +26 108
>Matthew: EGIITUV L10 G.VE +22 85
#note (-9.7) Bad, bad play. GIVE/KAE is correct.

#note ZEBRASS is gonna happen! Gimme an S!
>Matthew: IILMNTU 7I MULTI +18 182
#note I was 50/50 on this one.
>Matthew: IILMNTU --  -18 164
#note I have to give her credit for that gutsy challenge. She knows her stuff; I do not.
>Marci: DEF J6 FED +32 287
>Matthew: IILMNTU -MULITI +0 164
#note (-15.1) This is frustration kicking in.

#note This play hurts. Not only do I play off my only S, killing my ZEBRASS dreams, but I block the OZONATED play. But whatever. After ELEVEN turns without a freaking O, I think it's safe to say I'm just not going to draw one this game, right?

#note ...
>Matthew: NOOOORT H1 TOO. +12 268
#note I didn't want to spoil the simplicity of my last note, but I actually did have a bingo possibility: OCTOROON through a C. And yes, I did see that over the board.
