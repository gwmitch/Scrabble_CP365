>George_Viebranz: CFNOOOS 9E COOF +20 20
#note Second best.  COOFS K4 is 16 more points.  I may have done that if I had seen it.  
>Maria_Fernandes: HIN E9 .HIN +18 48
>George_Viebranz: AGINNOS 13C AGON +20 40
>Maria_Fernandes: LUV 7J LUV +8 56
>George_Viebranz: EINNSTU 10H TUNNIES +67 107
#note 7 more points at M1, but I am not stupid (sometimes).
>Maria_Fernandes: GW 11D W.G +7 63
#note Hmm... I wonder if she has an S.
>George_Viebranz: ABELLRT 12C BA.E +34 141
#note Not even the best block.  BLA(H) 10B is #1. I didn't see it.  It's worth far less but the leave is much better.  Probably would have still done this.
>Maria_Fernandes: ?DEEEIS 14E SEEDIEr +79 142
>George_Viebranz: AHLLRTV L9 V.LL +14 155
#note Second to V(E)LAR M9.
>Maria_Fernandes: AIS H12 AI.S +18 160
>George_Viebranz: AAEHIRT N3 HETAIRA. +63 218
#note Pretty lucky draw.  I'll probably never be 100% on all of the spellings of this word, but I figured I was more sure than she was.  
>Maria_Fernandes: JNU M2 JUN +32 192
>George_Viebranz: AAEFIUY O7 FEY +43 261
#note Look at that shitty leave.
>Maria_Fernandes: DEX 15J DEX +23 215
>George_Viebranz: AAIPRTU 13J PAIR +28 289
#note Best!
>Maria_Fernandes: BO 12H .BO +12 227
#note It was here that I became 99.99% certain she was playing up.
>George_Viebranz: AEITTUY M13 .AY +21 310
#note Wish I had seen A(R)TY M12
>Maria_Fernandes: ?AEEMST D3 METAnES +78 305
#note SCOOF* is no good of course.  I was 50/50 on it, but I was fairly confident I could pull out a win without challenging. 
>George_Viebranz: EIIRTTU 5D .UIT +8 318
#note Like I told Ubeika in the game before this, I can't go a tournament without playing a phony 4.  Problem is, I never know they're phony until later.  This one stays, thankfully.
>Maria_Fernandes: LO 4K LO.. +8 313
#note Not a bad setup, I guess.
>George_Viebranz: CEEIRTT 8A CIT. +18 336
#note I wonder about this play.  I knew she wasn't going to bingo with what was unseen, but I still might have been able to.  
>Maria_Fernandes: IQ 5J QI +26 339
>George_Viebranz: DDEERRT F5 .D +7 343
#note This is the play that drove both of us crazy.  There were two in the bag, I know because I counted them 3 times.  When I reached in for the third time, she said, "How many times do you have to count?!" to which I replied, "You're not supposed to talk on my time."  She continued, saying, "Just put the bag down and feel like this!" I told her to please be quiet.  If I thought I was going to lose the game, I might have called the director.  If I was a nastier person and knew for a fact she was playing up, I might have said something like Pete suggested: "That shit doesn't fly in D1."  But I figured I'd stick it to her by pulling out the endgame, which I was still confident I would win.  
>Maria_Fernandes: KR B8 .RK +17 356 
#note as far as I can see, WORK(I)NG B4 gives her the win.  It's 2 more points than (I)RK, it blocks decent plays through the M and leaves her with an out, probably.  I'm not sure what the last tile in the bag was, though, so she might not have had it.  
>George_Viebranz: DEEPRRT 3A PER.ED +22 365
#note Not a definite game winner.  I'm going out for at least 6. I figure she'll go for WOP A1 for 24, WAGON 2E for 21, or WAG/WAGON B13 for 23.  If she does WOP, she has 10 points on her rack, and I can go out for 10 with R(E)T B2.  If she does WAG/WAGON B13, she scores 23 but leaves 6 on her rack.  Then I do R(A)T 14A for 8 and tie. If she does WAGON, she only scores 21 but she only leaves 2 on her rack.  Then I do R(O)T for 9, get her 2 and lose by 1.  But she only has a few seconds on her clock, so I doubt that she would have figured any of this out.  
>Maria_Fernandes: AGNORW A1 WO. +24 380
#note And goes over on time to boot.  
>George_Viebranz: RT B2 R.T +10 375 
>George_Viebranz:  (AGNR) +10 385
#note She signs her initials to the tally slip before the score is written down and leaves the table.  What a baby.
