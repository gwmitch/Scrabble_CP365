>A.G._Pennypacker: CMRUUUX N7 C.UX +29 54
>Kelly: DEEIIPR 9F RIDE +23 71
#note Looked for a double-double, but never saw DE(NA)RII-K5. RIDE and IRE-9G tied for the two spot.
>A.G._Pennypacker: IMRSTUU O8 .MU +18 72
>Kelly: ?AEILPT E5 TALIPEd +90 161
#note Behind fLEAPIT, which doesn’t place a vowel next to the TLS. Major style points for PERI(NA)TAL, but no extra points. Scrabble isn’t fair sometimes.
>A.G._Pennypacker: EIPRSTU L8 .ISPUTER +74 146
>Kelly: ?DEJLTU 13I JUT.ED +44 205
#note Second to JUsTLED-12C, which would have required knowing the word and remembering that TALIPED isn’t a past-tense verb and takes an S.
>A.G._Pennypacker: DEHHIMT 14J HI.D +34 180
>Kelly: ?AGKLSW D10 WALK +28 233
#note Again, that S-hook would have been good to remember. WALK comes in third behind GAWKS and WALKS at 12A.

>A.G._Pennypacker: ACEIIOT 1B E.OTICA +30 252
>Kelly: BEILNOV 2H LIVEN +18 332
#note I wanted to do something with the V to take out the best bingo lane, but BOVINE was a better way to do it. The duck also likes a bunch of plays using the L-hook for EROTICA, another hook I remember seeing at one point but didn’t notice.
>A.G._Pennypacker: FGIOTWY 1K WIFTY +53 305
>Kelly: BENNNOS C9 NOB +16 348
#note I wanted to either clean up my rack or block row 14, but couldn’t find a way to do either that I liked. CP favors NOBS-14A, which I thought was too dangerous. NONE-3L would have sacked a few points to accomplish something, at least.
