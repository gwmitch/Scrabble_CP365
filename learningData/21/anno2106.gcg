>D_Ruby: ADEFNOU 8D FOUND +26 26
#note Strangely, FONDUE is +3.  Why is a leave of A 1 pt better than AE?  This may also be defensive considerations concerning putting the U on the star, I don't know.
>Verbie: BELMRST F6 ST.MBLER +70 70
#note Drew a hold call.  TEMBLORS E3 is +4.
>D_Ruby: ACEEGIP 11E E.EGIAC +40 66
>Verbie: EFINRWW H11 .WINE +39 109
#note Oopsie, watch for the snap-back of NEW-FOUND 8A 45.  Shedding the I in addition makes back 1 of equity but I'm still -5 here.
>D_Ruby: ELPRSUZ J10 Z. +31 97
#note Correct to not add the P here.  But by 7?  Is the P really a +10 to this leave?
>Verbie: EFIMRRW 12C WIF. +25 134
>D_Ruby: EGLPRSU L5 PURGLES +73 170
#note Where to start?  I didn't challenge because I saw GULPERS was one more point, and more obvious so I thought there was a trap play going on.  Next, it was mis-scored as 75.  But the big miss here is that SPLURGED H1 89 is available!  -16 net, if I shoot it down it's -89.
>Verbie: ?ELMRRY 8L .REY +24 158
#note WRY C12 18 keeps the E, which is a big deal here, making up the score differential and then some.  This play is -3 to it.

>D_Ruby: ACEIORT 14G A.ORETIC +74 266
#note Missing the H1 bingo lane again.  This time it's CERATOID for 12 extra.
>Verbie: ?AELMRS 5H cLAM.ERS +72 241
#note Now it's my turn to miss putting a bingo on a triple- I realized this on the Thursday following:  LaMASERY O1 89!  Chickened out on MAStERLY there for 86 OTB.
>D_Ruby: OX 6I OX +52 318
#note Rack not known.
>Verbie: ?ABNPTT 13K BAP +28 269
>D_Ruby: AADEHLO O1 HOLE. +27 345
#note Unless I am reading this rack wrong, this is an appalling play.  Keeps two A's and not the E, and on top of that ODAHS drops the right vowels scoring 12 more points, combined value missed = 20.
>Verbie: ?AINTTT 15A TITANaT. +76 345
#note Finally someone hits the "right" bingo!  Either blank-as-I of TITANITE is right there.

#note Total equity loss (counting the unchallenged phony at face value rather than at full value and charging me for not challenging):  Ruby 49, Verbie 29.
