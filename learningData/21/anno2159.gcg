>Mike: BEIKMNR 8H BRINK +32 32
>Eric: AANOR L3 ANORA. +20 20
>Mike: EEELMNQ M2 NEEM +22 54
>Eric: ?AAEILN H3 INArA.LE +60 80
#note Missing BANALIzE, which might have drawn a challenge as well.
>Mike: DEEILQR G3 QI +44 98
>Eric: IIIOOO -IIIOOO +0 80
>Mike: ?DEELRU 10D UnRE.LED +62 160
#note So, of course, I take the lowest scoring of about twenty bingos here. Best is the beautiful RELUm(IN)ED 4B (UNDERLINE also works, but opens the 3x3).
>Eric: CDEIJ D9 J.ICED +32 112
>Mike: ABILPUV F4 PUB +18 178
#note PULVINI 4C, a word I didn't know in a spot I probably wouldn't have seen, sims about 6 points better.
>Eric: OWW C13 WOW +31 143
>Mike: AEILUVV 15A VA. +27 205
#note Virtually tied with VIVA B10. I don't see much to choose here; any opinions?
>Eric: CLO B12 LOC. +30 173
>Mike: EIILUVZ 12D .IVIL +11 216
#note Can't I trade that U for a third I? (And how often do I say that?) VULPINE 4C or VOWELIZE 13A are both about a 5-point improvement over this.
>Eric: DGO K3 GOD +29 202
>Mike: EEGIRUZ 12D .....IZER +46 262
#note "Hold, please," I hear from across the table. Crud, I wasn't too sure of it, but figued I didn't have much else going on here. Now I'm about to lose a turn on it, as he's stopped the clock for the challenge...
>Eric: HIM -  +0 202
#note ...and we get a rather surprising (to both of us) green screen.
>Mike: EGPRSSU M9 PURSE +44 306
#note Missing SPURGES N5; PUGS might also be an improvement over PURSE in the same spot (for defense, I guess).
>Eric: HIM N8 HIM +28 230
>Mike: EEGNSTX O8 EX +54 360
>Eric: EIU H12 .IEU +12 242
#note "Alright," Eric says, "let's see how badly you can hurt me with this."
>Mike: AEGNSST A8 STAGE +24 384
#note The answer: Surprisingly little, actually. Plays at I3 (such as SAG) sim best, but I think it has to be better to start taking out lanes.
>Eric: DFOOS 14J FOODS +43 285
>Mike: AHNSTTY B7 THAT +20 404
#note I'm just clearing the T's out of the way, as there are still three to draw. HASTY I1 sims best, which seems a little strange; however, anything is 100% to win.
>Eric: AY G6 AY +22 307
>Mike: AGNOSTY I1 NASTY +33 437
#note STOPING 4C (there we go again with that line!) is best.
>Eric: EFNORTT 1F FRO.T +24 331
#note FORNENT 1D is best for Eric here.
>Mike: GO N1 GO +10 447
#note One play - or in this case, one challenge - can swing a game. Not to say I wouldn't have won without the extra turn, but it certainly didn't hurt.
>Mike:  (ENT) +6 453
