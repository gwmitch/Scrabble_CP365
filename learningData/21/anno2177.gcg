#note Surprisingly, after 1000 iterations, Quackle likes OD in the same spot. Why keep AHRSS when AHRS scores 4 more points?

#note Ugh. First of all, I should have tacked on the I for 3 more points. Second of all, I shouldn't have missed my bingos. Well actually, I don't know HARRISA or RAPHIAS, but I could have found SHARIAS or PARIAHS (both hard finds for me).

#note I really liked this play. Even if I knew Q's choice of ARECA M3, I wouldn't have played it. AE puts me up 38 points and blocks the better lane (the other being to the C in the C column). Not only that, but if she bingos she will automatically open the triple lane, which will leave me big counterplay options.

#note Didn't challenge PUDGE* This lost me the game, along with another poor play later on.
>Phil: NNOORST H5 NO +7 277
#note Quackle significantly prefers NONET 14J. I just wanted to open a lane, knowing she almost definitely didn't have a bingo, and I could easily draw one out of the bag keeping NORST.

#note Wow- absolutely horrendous. ODD N13 by far.

#note I wanted to set up the S hook without giving her scoring options. Can't believe I didn't see the front hook to NOW.
