#note Interesting question whether it's better to play an S here or not.  Using the S scores two more and probably gives me a slightly higher chance to bingo.  But it also gives away that I have a second S.  Keeping the S likely allows me to score higher when I don't bingo, and it also slightly decreases his chance of bingoing on the first move.

#note DEGAS in the same spot is better.

>Dave: CENSSTT K9 SCENT +25 74
#note I thought it was a tossup between this and CENTS in the same spot, but SECT 11H is better defensively than either of them.

#note This worked out really well for me, but XYST J6 is stronger.  I liked my play better than XYSTI 14A, because I'm opening up two high scoring zones on columns M and O, so that I can grab one after he gets the other.

#note Good timing has left me with a nice lead on a pretty tight board.

#note I was very tempted to try to draw for the OVERJOYS extension, but this has to be right.
>GI_Joel: IORS 14C SORI +17 162
#note Joel took a long time on this play and was clearly frustrated with his rack.  He bluffed me into thinking he had the last S, which becomes important a few moves later.

#note Quackle's favorite plays are all exchanges, but I prefer my move.  Because of his SORI play, I thought he was holding an S, and I wanted to make it harder for him to make a play on row 5 hooking SIZAR.  I also took out the N2-N6 spot where he could easily hit me with an H ending word (or even TRANQ).  My leave isn't great, but at least I've gotten rid of all the duplicates.

#note I don't know what I should do in this endgame, and I'm not convinced that Quackle does either.  I saw two possible bingos for him, MUNCHERS A1 and HUNGERS B5, but the score is too close for me to go all out to block both of those possibilities.  My first thought was ATEMOYA E1, but with a high chance of drawing two consonants, I thought I might not be able to go out next turn, and he was likely to hit me with some good scoring parallel plays. (e.g., HEW D3)  I thought about adjusting that with ATOMY to hold onto more vowels.  Somehow, I convinced myself I would get smacked by D column plays in that scenario too, but with nothing to cross in front of the Y, I don't know what I was worried about.  But then I got the idea to split the scoring tiles over two moves to do more with them.  My play was designed both to take out the HUNGERS spot and to hang onto the letters for YENTA 15D.  It turned out to be a moot point, because the worst case scenario happened to Joel: he left both of the remaining vowels in the bag after bingoing.
>GI_Joel: CGHNRSW 15F SW.NG +11 355
#note Joel can't win now, but Quackle finds a clever way for him to minimize the deficit:  LAWS K4, setting up CHINE 3K on the next turn.
