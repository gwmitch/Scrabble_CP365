>Dielle: EFRTUU 8D FUTURE +26 26
#note Before this game, I took a few extra minutes outside, running up and down stairs, breathing, self-talking...anything to get the last game out of my head. The last thing I need when playing someone of Dielle's caliber is to be emotional.
>Mike: ?AILORX 7F uXORIAL +95 95
#note Draws like this will help.
>Dielle: DNOOT 8K TONDO +26 52
>Mike: EINORST K5 ST..IONER +86 181
#note I was about to play SNOOTIER, then said, "No, there's something better than that." I found (RE)ORIENTS, but something nagged at me, "Look again." Then I found this, which is equivalent to RESTATION. This drew a hold. (Why isn't this voice there all the time?)
>Dielle: JO J10 JO +52 104
>Mike: AABEGIW 12J B.IGE +28 209
#note BEWIG in the same spot is an improvement; if you're going to leave two A's you may as well score while you do.
>Dielle: AIIV M10 VI.IA +18 122
>Mike: AAEHNPW 6D PAH +29 238
#note WAP in the same spot is better; I guess it depends which hook you prefer to leave. Actually WHAP is right behind, and would probably be my choice if I had it to do again.
>Dielle: EGMRU O11 GRUME +37 159
#note Oops. This is how games get blown--by letting phonies through!
>Mike: AEEENSW D3 WEE. +18 256
>Dielle: ?AIMNOV H2 OMNIV..As +64 223
>Dielle: ?AIMNOV --  -64 159
#note Hold, please.....I have a bad history with challenging/letting things stand against Dielle. It seems like too often, I trust her to know her words. But this one looked so wrong, I had to challenge. (There's another reason I had to challenge, actually...)
>Mike: ADENRSY 4C Y.ARENDS +63 319
>Dielle: ?AIMNOV 3B VO. +28 187
>Mike: ACDLTTY A1 CLAY +49 368
>Dielle: ?AIMN D8 .IN +6 193
#note Wonder what she drew here; perhaps another IN?
>Mike: AADITTW 11D DAWT +24 392
#note Time to start playing defense.
>Dielle: ?AIKMN 9C K. +11 204
>Mike: AEIILST 14E LAITIES +71 463
#note Or, time to start bingoing again. This is third best, though. Didn't know VIGIA took the S; should have seen (C)ILIATES up top.
>Dielle: ?ABIMP 13G BAP +29 233
#note (Misscored as 28.)
>Mike: AENOQRS H12 Q..S +69 532
#note The hits just keep on coming...
>Dielle: ?AFNOOU -FOOU +0 233
#note Ouch for having to exchange down 300.
>Mike: AEFNORT C6 OF +18 550
#note Or at 3F. But really, does it matter here?
>Dielle: ?EEHINZ 15A ZEcHIN +67 300
#note I held this momentarily, having never seen it, until I saw what her final rack (and mine) would be.
>Mike: ADEENRT 1A .ANTERED +86 636
#note Final score officially recorded as 660-299. Sorry about that, Dielle.
>Mike:  (CEGLMOU) +24 660
