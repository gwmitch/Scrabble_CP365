>David: BEIV 8G VIBE +18 18
>Mike: DENPTWZ J7 W.PT +11 11
#note Taking the points with ZEE J6 is half a point better, but I really hated the five-consonant leave.
>David: IT 9H TI. +13 31
>Mike: DEKMNSZ 6F MENDS +28 39
#note The sim winner is ZEKS in this spot. However, against someone like Gibson, who is known to be very defense-oriented, I want to keep creating opportunities to score. This and the previous play fit into that theme. Quackle says I'm wrong by 8 points, but in this circumstance, I don't think the margin is that wide.
>David: EU F5 E.U +5 36
>Mike: AHIKNOZ E5 HANK +43 82
#note Or KHAN; they're about a point apart. (Maybe KHAN accomplishes what I want better...)
>David: AIIN K10 INIA +10 46
>Mike: CDDIORZ 13I DI.ZO +34 116
#note Missing ZIRCON H1 for 60. Ugh - I didn't even look at the spot. This is 14 points back.
>David: ?EEILRS 12C SERvILE +67 113
>Mike: CDEEORS L4 RECODES +77 193
#note So, of course, I'm unjustly rewarded.
>David: JOT 13B JOT +26 139
>Mike: AAILRTX 14L AXAL +42 235
#note I'm not sure I understand this one. There are five As left to draw, and only two I's. I know IRT is generally a worse leave than ART, but is it really two full points worse, given the tile pool?
>David: ABNOORT 4H ROBO.ANT +62 201
#note Beautiful find!
>Mike: ILNQRTY O12 YI.L +33 268
#note Just barely ahead of QAT on win%. After all, it's not like I'm not going to have a spot to dump the Q next turn if needed.
>David: GOY 14A GOY +38 239
>Mike: CFNOQRT O1 FON. +21 289
#note Come on, Mike. If you're not going to dump the Q, at least score points! FROCK 8A is the winner. Minus 30.
>David: AEU 15B EAU +21 260
>Mike: ACQRTTV 8A TRAC. +42 331
#note This sims basically even with QAT at M3, which has been an option the past several turns. I didn't even look at QAT 4C, which wins handily (about 78% to 75%). However, TRACK guarantees me 23-26 for QAT next turn, while QAT gives me troubie if I can't find a vowel in the bag. I'd probably play QAT, but I wouldn't be happy about it. (Somehow we both added 42 to 289 and got 321. Left uncorrected.)
>David: ?AEGIMU B2 qUAGMI.E +82 342
#note You're welcome. (Misscored as 80 and uncorrrected.)
>Mike: DFGQRTV M3 Q.T +26 357
#note I had Q generate 50 choices and ran a many-ply sim. After 500 iterations, the top *nineteen* choices are exchanges of some sort (keeping just an R sims best, for what it's worth). I guess that means the play is to exchange. Still, I'm in decent shape if I can just catch a couple of vowels to hit the 15L spot....
>David: EERSW 15H EWERS +40 382
#note ....before he does. Oof.
>Mike: DFGHNRV 4A V.NG +24 381
#note Best. Note that after my bingo, I looked at 24 tiles - five vowels and 19 consonants.
>David: AEILOPU H1 POU. +18 400
#note PRAU E11 is a 4-point improvement (proof left to the reader). I know, when I'm making so many mistakes, I shouldn't be pointing out David's.
>Mike: DFHR K3 F.H +30 411
#note After this game, David was very complimentary of my play. (Little did he know.) I think he's extrapolating from too small a sample size, personally. On the other hand, when you've got David Gibson praising your play, you're in a pretty good spot.
>David: AEIL N9 ILEA +11 411
#note Final score recorded as 415-401.
>David:  (DR) +6 417
