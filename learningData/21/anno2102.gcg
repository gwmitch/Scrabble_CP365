#note Someone will probably accuse me of results-oriented thinking here, but I like playing this way. Yes the POO leave is shitty (hurr durr) but aside from the X spot at C9 there are no intermediate hotspots left on this board. I like the combo of best score while killing the best non-bingo scoring spot.

#note The point of ISC as I see it is that you can try stuff out that you wouldn't bother with in a game that counted for something. It always amuses me when certain people pull their hair out over someone making an odd-looking play in an online game, but I guess Internet = Serious Business. Anyway, in a tournament I would just play OXID without much second thought, but here with six As and two ?s to come, why not give it a shot? Now if he had played something like GORE instead, I might give it a closer look in a real game.
