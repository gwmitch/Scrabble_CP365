>Carol_Ravichandran: AGKU 8E KAGU +18 18
>Jason: AACDEIX 7G AX +23 23
#note Didn't like it at 9E, although her counterplays there could give me counterplays coming back. Dunno.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AGNV 6D VANG +15 33
>Jason: ACDEHIN D3 CHI.E +26 49
#note I think I overthought this position, although this play isn't horrible, even though it isn't in Speedy's top 15.
>Carol_Ravichandran: DN E5 D.N. +26 59
>Jason: ADEEINR 7G ..E +11 60
#note Accompanied by Carol's "that can't be good."
>Carol_Ravichandran: HWY 6I WHY +25 84
>Jason: ADEINRV 5C V.. +7 67
#note Oh, man! VINE(Y)ARD would've been a sweet find! Carol said "Stop that!" and I said "Really? You want me to stop scoring 11 and 7?" She answered: "Well, you can keep doing THAT." I'm still confused.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ACDENST C7 DECANTS +86 170
#note Whenever one of us breaks 100, it's always "X dalmatians." So, confirming the score, I said "170 dalmatians," to which Carol said "Where're we gonna put them all?"
>Jason: ADEILNR 11B I.LANDER +68 135
#note "You may now bingo," Carol said after hitting her clock. Only saw the "lame" (as I said) I(S)LANDER before going two rows up. The only two bingos. The less impressive "135 dalmatians," followed by my "ruff!" after Carol said it.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ?AEFIRS 10E FAIRESt +79 249
#note Nice fit, but it's 89 if she knows WHY takes an S.
>Jason: EEORTTY 12C .OY +25 160
#note "Quit toying with me!" Carol said.
>Carol_Ravichandran: BORW 12H BROW +23 272
>Jason: AEEERTT 5J EAT +21 181
#note OMG! ET(C)ETERA is good?!?!?! How ridic! I think I actually saw it, too. I think I should've gone with (REB)ATE here, which I saw.
>Carol_Ravichandran: GMU 4K MUG +24 296
>Jason: EEEPRTU 13J PEER +21 202
#note Again, not a fan of Speedy's better options, expect for PU(C)E at 3B. Still, can't knock opening two lines in the spot I'm in.
>Carol_Ravichandran: LO 3D .OL +5 301
#note Hmph. Well, gotta hope she misses, can't exactly go playing defense.
>Jason: ENOPTUZ L11 ON. +26 228
#note (BROW)NOUT would've been awesome.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ?ABELST 14D BATtLES +69 370
#note Was going to play it at 14H with four overlaps before my play, which explains why she missed the handful of better bingos. She scored it as 70, I counted and got something else. So we neutralized and she re-scored. "69?" she asked. "I got 69," I said. "That's something you shouldn't tell your mother," she said. Touche!
>Jason: EIPRTUZ M2 ZI. +26 254
#note About this time, Carolyn and Jeff F. go to the challenge computer. I missed it, but after the result one (playfully, I'm sure) hit the other. "Violence!" Carol said, which is the only reason I noticed. "She challenged her own word!" Jeff said. Turns out Carolyn played THWACK for a bunch and Jeff held. He let it go and -S hooked it, and Carolyn held and eventually challenged. "Tried to put the double screw on, huh?" Carol said when she heard the story.
>Carol_Ravichandran: EIRT 15A TIRE +20 390
>Jason: EELPRTU 2J PUT.ER +46 300
#note I figured she couldn't challenge here. Pianowski's gotten me using "futz" as a verb, and my dad always used "putz" as a verb, as in "Quit putzing around or we're going to be late!" I hated it, but like I said, unless she knows all her Z sixes (which I doubt), she can't risk losing the turn. And it's far better than any of my legit plays. For her part, Carol said "I don't trust you" as soon as I hit my clock, but let it go.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADFT O1 D.AFT +39 429
>Jason: EIJLMOQ B14 Q. +22 322
#note Well, so much for "out bingo while catching her with JQ to pull off a miracle." Fishing for the O, which I would hit. My body language/sighing must've been really negative here, because she said "You know, it's OK to lose to your mother. It's in 'Reader's Digest'." 
>Carol_Ravichandran: INO 15G ION +18 447
#note "And those are the good ones!" Carol said. I think she forgot to count tI, as she got 17.
>Jason: EIJLMOO 1G MOJO +43 365
#note The fish works, and yet Q says playing the M at 10B is two better, which mystifies me. I'm too lazy to figure out why.
>Carol_Ravichandran: IIOSU G1 .ISO +14 461
>Jason: EIL M9 LIE +6 371
#note I lamented her blocking not only LEI at 2E for15, but (COL)LIE "for the 'ruff' factor," I said. She agreed it would've been cute. Other than the two missed bingos, neither of which I'm too upset out, a fairly solid game. "I'm the luckbox ... for a change," she said. Rightly enough; I started like 9-0 against Carol, bagged her repeatedly. 4-2, decent spread, but I knew nobody was running away with it. I felt like I still had a chance to win the tourney, which I did.
>Jason:  (IU) +4 375
