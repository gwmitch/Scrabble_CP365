>Evans: CEEFRTU 8G FEU +12 12
>Alyssa: EJX I6 JE.X +27 27
>Evans: CEKORTT G8 .ROCK +15 27
#note Why did I see a need to unload my great CKR synergy? Why did I NOT see a need to un-double my T's? This play is awful. COT or ROT or TOT at J5 would be fine.
>Alyssa: LMR 7H M.RL +10 37
>Evans: AEIIMTT J9 IMITATE +76 103
#note I chickened out on MILITATE! I am terrible. Also, L1 is better placement -- better to dangle an I in the triple-triple lane than an E.
>Alyssa: IIII -BDEL +0 37
#note Guess I'll block that triple now...
>Evans: AAEGNSU H12 AGUE +25 128
#note WAIT A MINUTE! Did I just miss GUANASE? Seriously?! Well, no... I didn't miss it... I actually spotted it, and then convinced myself it wasn't good! How do I do things like this? This makes me very sad.
>Alyssa: BOST K5 BO.TS +24 61
>Evans: AADENSW F9 AW +28 156
#note I actually know WEASAND! Really, I promise! Oh wait... it doesn't play, so I don't get to redeem myself. Oh well... fishing it is.
>Alyssa: ACEH 8K .HECA +42 103
>Evans: ADEINSV L4 VID +21 177
#note Yeah, I missed ENVIED for 42. Terrible.
>Alyssa: OZ N8 .OZ +34 137
>Evans: AENORSW O8 .WA +22 199
>Alyssa: DEGOST E6 GODETS +25 162
>Evans: EINORSY F6 OY +17 216
#note I saw COZY/OY, but for some reason I decided I liked what this play did to the board. I was wrong.
>Alyssa: ?EEILLN D1 NELLIEs +73 235
#note See? Wrong.
>Evans: DEINRSV M7 D.V +26 242
#note Missing INVERSED. Wow.

#note Missing PTERIN O1.
>Alyssa: AENRS D11 EARNS +14 410
#note STERNA is best, but it's hard to care when you've got the match won. Congrats Alyssa!
