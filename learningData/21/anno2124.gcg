#note Best play after the crazy PEMBINa(S).

>Phil: ?ABENOY F2 BAYONE.s +77 161
#note sOYBEAN/SIMP is 6 more points, but even if I saw it, it's too open for my liking.
>Denise: ACLP B6 CLAP +24 62
>Phil: ABDDEGL E3 BAD +27 188
#note I saw Quackle's choice, GARBLED L4 but didn't like it for some reason.

#note I'm glad Quackle agrees with passing up FIX for 20 points...the T hook is just too dangerous.

>Denise: EEEEIOV --  -73 116
>Phil: FILQSUX 4L FIX +41 336
#note I knew her rack, and knew that she could really only get about 30 from the T with something like LUNT. Plus, FIX scores 41 and sets up QUID M2. I prefer it to Quackle's FIXER L2.
