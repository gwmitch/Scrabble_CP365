#note Now my opponent is toast! Little did I know that things were about to get quite a bit breadier...

>Carl: AAEEEGN C10 AGEE +12 239
#note Again I undervalue the G. SEAT 3E is best.

#note Fishing with (KI)R wins the sim by about 8 points. This puts me down about 13 points total for the game.
>Keith_S: GILNO K5 LINGO +30 243
>Carl: AIJLNNR F8 .AJ +29 302
#note A dreadful play. NINJA L1 is 12 points above it. Now I'm 25 points off of perfect. Would I need those points later?

#note Still wrong. The sim prefers INLY I2. I find that questionable with the B unseen.
>Keith_S: LOW F13 OWL +17 298
>Carl: AIINNRS O5 SIR.NIAN +59 385
#note Losing the challenge cost me a tempo and my opponent handily seized upon this. Now he has two scary lanes and almost certainly has the blank. SIRENIAN is about even money with ANILIN 15C.
>Keith_S: ?ACDITW 15D WI.DCATs +101 399
#note I think it's fair to say that Keith earned this game.
>Carl: AEEEEIO M2 EE.IE +10 395
#note You know something? I sort of like losing this way, knowing that a better player would not be in this position. In this case, the better player put me in this position. How quickly the tables turn. At least I didn't muck up the endgame for once.
>Keith_S: ABDEFFO 12H OFFED +32 431
#note Best! Blocks my best out and scores well. Were it not for the threat of OLEA G10, what would the right play be?
>Carl: AEO 3G .OEA +8 403
#note Changed my mind and decided to mess up the endgame after all. OLEA L7 is best. Remember, I took 12th place at this tournament, which is really really good! So far, I've played 2 out of 6 endgames correctly. On the plus side, I've missed no bingos.
>Carl:  (AB) +8 411
#note A grand total of 75 points below Quackle. And if you think this is bad, you ain't seen nothin' yet!
