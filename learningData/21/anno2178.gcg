#note YOWIE is waaay to open for me. The only other option Q suggests is exchange keeping ES, which I probably should have done. However, I didn't want to go down 40 early against someone much better than me.

#note At least I can't say I didn't look in the spot- I did ask her if she thought MARTIALY could be good. Too bad I missed MILITARY and LIMITARY for 102 each!! That woulda been hella nice.
