>Phil_Wertheimer: BIJOU 8D BIJOU +34 34
#note Of note, this is the fifth time I'm going first in the seven Philly games. Also of note, Phil is an asshole for refusing to share his racks. Of even more note, this is our first game in a tournament, and I'm wearing the vest.
>Sam_: AAEEMOO D4 AMOE.A +20 20
#note Tacking on the E for AMOEBAE D4 is better by about four points. I guess it takes away the hook possibilities and avoids the two-vowel leave.

>Sam_: BDDEKNV L1 KE.B +30 317
#note Stupid play, VERB is clearly better and I don't know why I didn't play it.
>Phil_Wertheimer: AFO K10 OAF +26 316
>Sam_: DDDMNVZ -DDDNV +0 317
#note I liked the synergy here, but keeping Z might be better to give myself another shot at pulling a plank.
>Phil_Wertheimer: ACERT J7 TRACE +30 346
>Sam_: EEHIIMZ 14K M.ZE +34 351
#note I had some reason for picking this over HAZE B12, but it seems questionable to say the least. HAZE looks much better.
>Phil_Wertheimer: DENRV N10 VEND.R +18 364
>Sam_: DEHIIPP 12H HI +22 373
#note Championship Player picked DYE 10B...huh. PI 12H looks like an improvement over HI as well, which I wasn't sure about.
>Phil_Wertheimer: ?ADILRU 1L .ADI +27 391
>Sam_: ?DEIPPR N1 .RIPPED +30 403
#note Didn't know DIDaPPER N1. DIPPED is two points better here.
>Phil_Wertheimer: ?LTUW B3 WeLT +17 408
#note WYe or WYn 10B are best.
