#note I put some thought into OREIDE vs. trading. I don't really like the idea of throwing away a good rack to score 18 and keep just an I. Maybe it's a style thing. Quackle is on my side by about a point. Not sure though.
>Alyssa: ABGHN 8D BHANG +28 28
>Evans: DEEIRSV I2 DERIVES +75 75
#note SHRIEVED is a lot better. Duh.
>Alyssa: ?AEENTT 4F ENT.EATy +66 94
#note Double-doubles through the I: TETANIZE, TETANISE, TETANIES.
>Evans: ADEFIIU D8 .IFID +22 97
#note Maybe if I'd kept a consonant here, this game would have gone differently. I missed FIAT H1.
>Alyssa: EFM 3K FEM +29 123
>Evans: AAEEOOU -AAEEOOU +0 97
#note Am I supposed to keep something here? An A? An E? Both? Not sure.

#note I ended up holding onto this U for way too long, and it was a hell of a bingo-killer. This scores the most but is clearly wrong. KAURI 3C or OUPH E5 is 8-9 points better.
>Alyssa: DEG K3 ..DGE +20 179
>Evans: ANOOSTU E5 OAT. +20 179
#note Dumping two vowels with 3F ROUE sims really well! KINA at 11C scores really well, too. My play is a five-point error. Sounds about right.

>Evans: ACNOSUV D3 VAC +21 200
#note Is it just me, or is HAVOC a really hard word to see? -7. I'm not playing too well this game.
>Alyssa: AALLO L8 .ALLOA +18 244
#note First time seeing that word played for or against me. Cool.

#note Isn't it weird how I can play like garbage the whole game, never hold a lead longer than one turn, and then all of a sudden steal this game with a 90-point bingo? I feel so cheap.
>Alyssa: RTU B12 RUT +14 335
#note I thought she was putting RID there to set up GRID with either the G or the blank. Turns out the G and the blank were precisely the last two tiles in the bag. Weird.
>Evans: EEINOUW M7 ..W +26 396
#note I figure that because she has two lanes (into GRID and through the I in CILIA), I won't try to stop her from bingoing. Instead I make a one-tile play, scoring 26 and keeping one in the bag. If I had known she didn't have the G or the blank (!!) I most definitely would have played ZOWIE.
>Alyssa: EENORTX A14 EX +29 364
#note CP likes IRE E10. I don't know why.
>Evans: EEGINOU H1 GEN. +20 416
#note I was short on time. This play is wrong. Oh well.
>Alyssa: ?ENORT 14D sTON.ER +10 374
#note With my terrible rack, it's actually best to slowplay out with either TOLLER 10J or a play from E10 (INERT, INERTS, INSERT). I'm not gonna score anything anyway...
