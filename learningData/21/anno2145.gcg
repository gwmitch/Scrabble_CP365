>Jeff_Fiszbein: FOOP 8E POOF +18 18
>Jason: AEIOPRS 9C SOAPIER +78 78
#note Missed SOAPIER/S(POOF) for three more. Didn't count FE originally, so I got 73. Thanks to Jeff for catching the mistake ... I've beaten Jeff once on a recount, would've hated to do it again.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DEIMTT D9 .MITTED +24 42
>Jason: AEEGJSX 15A JEE. +36 114
#note "You were supposed to play all singles," Jeff said.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: HKNT 11B TH.NK +24 66
>Jason: AAGMNSX B13 AX. +20 134
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ELY 10G LYE +20 86
#note "This was a bad play," Jeff said in the recount. I told him I didn't think so; scored decently, opened a touch. "You didn't see my leave," he said. Fair enough.
>Jason: AAGMNOS 8A AMA +17 151
#note Should've played MOA, same spot. Not too terrible a whiff, though.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: NOW 7A NOW +26 112
>Jason: GLNNORS F6 GL.. +11 162
#note Just barely makes the list, at 15th. I like Q's pick of (K)LONG, which I didn't know.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ENRW 13A W.N.ER +18 130
>Jason: GNNOORS 6F .ONG +6 168
#note Again one away from LORGNONS! And again a lousy play! Don't know why I didn't play GOON at 11I, other than an irrational obsession with shutting the board.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GLLUY 11I GULL +14 144
#note As I hit my clock after GONG, Jeff said "Must be nice to have a lead." After the game, he said he kept the case Y to hook.
>Jason: AINORSV L8 VOI.A +24 192
#note Put down VIOLA, then thought I should play the one that doesn't -S hook. Yeah, I won't play GOON and keep NRS, but I'll play this to keep NRS. It makes sense to me. :)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: INY 8L .INY +30 174
>Jason: ?ENQRSU O4 QUER. +27 219
#note D'oh! I saw REQUiNS and forgot about the spot! Bad miss.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BBIOR H1 RIBBO. +39 213
#note "Even though this gave you a bingo, I still think it's the right play," Jeff said in the recount. Totally agree.
>Jason: ?DDENRS 2H .NDoRSED +76 295
#note I actually picked up my tiles to play D(I)D at M7 before I looked through the I one last time. Somehow, now I see SaRD(I)NED immediately. Ah, how my brain works... Again, totally not seeing the NOW -S hook.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: FITU L1 F.UIT +24 237
>Jason: DEHOTUZ N6 HO.ED +36 331
#note Speedy agrees, but I still think I should've played HO at 1N.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AET 1N AE +17 254
#note Jeff put down (F)ETA before realizing he'd made TE*.
>Jason: AACCTUZ 3F CU. +8 339
#note Well, I drew CACA. (rim shot) And looking at that beautiful pool, too late to exchange, me in time trouble (I had about 2:30 left after this play), I gotta worry. This looks like a situation where I saw Speedy's best play of CZA(R), looked for something better (I really wanted points for the Z to outrun Jeff's bingo), didn't find it, forgot about CZA(R). A beautiful thing about CZA(R) which I missed is that it blocks all D1 bingos. I think I'd wizened up on the NOW hook by this time. Horrible play. I even like sacrificing the three to make CU(R) and block -R bingos to the triple.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIRSTV D1 VERITAS +85 339
#note Only bingo. "Tie game," I said to confirm the score. He was off, but we fixed it. "Oh, and there's a nice surprise in there for you," I said as my clock was started. "The blank and Z?" he asked. "No, just the blank," I said. "The blank and Z would be TWO nice surprises."
>Jason: AACISTZ 4A ZIT.S +24 363
#note "Then it doesn't matter," Jeff said, "'cause whoever has the Z's gonna win." I relaxed when I saw what he had/he couldn't score well. Still, I didn't see a great spot. I put down CZA(R) before realizing that gave him bI(Z)E to win by two! Uh-oh. Clock's ticking. I have four wins and a tie here, so naturally I pick the worst win. ZI(T)S at 5J and 5B win by three, SIZ(E) at 2A by two. This wins by one, and ZAS at J4 ties. Jeff thought I had a better Z play for sure, but it turns out it's only a marginal one.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EI M11 sEI +11 350
#note Jeff missed yE(T)I at C2 for 13, which I only saw late in the post-mortem. He thought this was 12, so he was disappointed that he didn't play bI(Z)E or sI(Z)E. He finished with :02, I had :12 left. "You two play too fast," Carol Rav said, looking at our clock. Not my best-played game, obviously, but it's always good to get the heart pumping early in the morning (and start 1-0).
>Jeff_Fiszbein:  (AAC) +10 360
