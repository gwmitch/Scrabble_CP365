>Phil: BDFILNT 8D BLIND +22 22
#note I debated BLIND and FLINT for a good minute. F/T has nice synergy so I opted to sacrifice two points for the leave. Quackle strongly prefers FLINT though.
>Sinacola: IQ 9C QI +25 25
>Phil: AFNNOOT F6 FO.N +15 37
>Sinacola: DIM 10B MID +29 54
>Phil: AGNOORT A8 GOA +19 56
#note Ick. AGOROT, which I don't know, is best, followed by ORANG, TONGA, GROAT, and GROAN.
>Sinacola: FOSTY 10F SOFTY +31 85
>Phil: JNOPRTT E5 JO +23 79
#note Omg. Saw JOTTY, then thought to myself "that's no good- you're thinking of JETTY and JUTTY."
>Sinacola: EY H10 .EY +13 98
>Phil: NOPRSTT 12D POTT. +20 99
>Sinacola: ?AINORS 7H ORdAINS +61 159
>Phil: AEEGNRS L2 ANERG.ES +70 169
#note Quackle somehows prefers GESNERIA for 4 more points. It gaves way too much options to score big for my liking.
>Sinacola: ALP 13C LAP +18 177
>Phil: AACDLNR M1 CLAD +23 192
#note After a long sim, Quackle likes CRAAL 2J, then CANARDS, neither of which I know.
>Sinacola: AC 5J CA. +10 187
>Phil: AELNRUW 1M .AW +24 216
#note JOWL/WO is nice.

>Phil: EEIINRT J4 I.E. +7 241
>Sinacola: IO O9 OI +10 295
>Phil: EEIMNRT 2K M..E +16 257
#note Wow- INTERMALE in the same spot for 84. For normal people like me, M(OI)RE is really nice, scoring 36 and leaving EINT; too bad I don't know any 5s.
>Sinacola: BGHRTUV 1J UH +12 307
>Phil: EEINRTV 15K EVITE +38 295
#note I knew I should have played EVENT, because of the unseen X.
>Sinacola: BHU I1 HUB +20 327
>Phil: AEENRTZ 13J NERTZ +33 328
#note It sims best by far, but I knew he would have the I and screw me over. RAZEE in the same spot would have worked better.
>Sinacola: EGINOVX 11J OX +23 350
>Phil: AERTU M13 .U. +3 331
#note Nooooo. I was so close to guessing CARET/CLADE, but didn't think CLADE would be good. Should have guessed, seeing as I was definitiely going to lose if I didn't. Should have thought that through.
>Sinacola: EGINV 5H VI... +10 360

>Sinacola: EGN B10 ..G +6 366
#note Missed his outplay of GENU 2F.
