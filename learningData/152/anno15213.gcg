#note Also considered I2 COMBO, BROMIC, and TOMB. COMBO looks quite good defensively - not sure what I liked so much about BRITT.

#note Not really sure how much credit to give Komol here - he took a long time on URSA, but played NICOL quite fast. I knew MOOL would not normally be that great but if I put him on an S, maybe it becomes a little more reasonable. I certainly like it better than Quackle does. 7L OM doesn't appear to accomplish much, which is why I didn't play it, but it isn't too far off from the best scores I can get in this spot and keeps the most balanced leave.

#note Of course GYBE normally but I'm trying to play it safe...not sure why I didn't do PREP though.

#note I missed the lone out, almost played something like 14G BIS anyway, blocking by accident. 14D TIBIAS is best.
