>Chris_Tallman: ?AAOVVW -  +0 0
#note Exch like 5
>Joshua_Sokol: DJKOPTU H5 JOUK +30 30
#note I think that this is the best placement. Yes it gives him a 2x J word but that would mean the double letter next to the U is intact for my next move.
>Chris_Tallman: GINO 5H .INGO +26 26
>Joshua_Sokol: DEMPSTU 9H STUMPED +80 110
#note Wow JINGO doesn't take a mere S. Well, good thing this placement is much better defensively. And yes, lucky draw.
>Chris_Tallman: DEILNST 7H .NLISTED +61 87
>Joshua_Sokol: ABBEINR O1 BRAINE. +33 143
#note This isn't correct. Better to just play BRIDE. Also, I now know RIBAND is also good with two Bs. 
>Chris_Tallman: EEIVW 2J VIEWE. +40 127
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEGMOY 10J MY +30 173
#note Champ prefers YOG(I) and BOM(B). I'm not sure why. If he has a C I could hopefully bingo with MYCS next turn (I guess that's unsure) and if not I'm still in a great position to win.
>Chris_Tallman: ACNTUWX 11K CUNT +32 159
#note Chris had a laugh at this rack.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABEGOS 12E BOdEGAS +71 244
#note GrOSBEA(K) I vaguely remember. Missed it though. GAzEBOS looks around the same strength as BOdEGAS or BOrAGES.
>Chris_Tallman: ARWX H11 R.WAX +45 204
>Joshua_Sokol: EFFIILT N4 LIF. +32 276
>Chris_Tallman: AGNR 11C GRAN +20 224
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEFHIT 3L HE +25 301
#note I don't remember why I decided to keep the F over the H. 
>Chris_Tallman: AALV C9 VA.AL +26 250
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFIOQT 14G Q.T +12 313
#note To block
>Chris_Tallman: DEILORZ 2H RE...... +14 264
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEFIOO 1C FOODIE +39 352
>Chris_Tallman: DEZ B12 ZED +39 303
>Joshua_Sokol: AAHIOOT 1K OHO +31 383
#note IOTA 3E seems to be the best block. DHOOTI also looks promising.
>Chris_Tallman: ?CINSTU 3C TUNICaS +79 382
#note This is phony?!?!?! wow...
>Joshua_Sokol: AAILRTY 4A ALIT +16 399
#note LIT is awesome here. Sets up RAYA and (D)A(T)ARY. Wish I would have seen that
>Chris_Tallman: AEEIOPR A4 .REPA +21 403
#note He thought AREPA was better than APORIA and I disagreed. I was right.
>Joshua_Sokol: ARY 13A R..AY +16 415
#note I also should have played RAY on AREPA... hehehe...
>Joshua_Sokol:  (EIO) +6 421
