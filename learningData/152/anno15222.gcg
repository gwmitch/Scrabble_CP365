#note ISOTHERE is the play - I saw it, but I considered ESOTERIC to be more defensive...

#note Pretty close between JOE and JO.
>Trip: ADHIP O11 APHID +50 213
#note Oh yeah. At this point I realize I had SCATTER/ESOTERICA and should have played ISOTHERE over ESOTERIC and feel like a fool. It's game 30 at Nationals. I guess Trip still had this for 45 across the board, but still.

#note EX scores better and keeps -ING.
>Trip: BKOR 4A BORK +38 284
>Will: AEGNOPV M3 GAN.V +26 375
#note GENEVA is better than GANEV but 4H PONCE takes care of the SKA hook nicely.

#note 2A REDOWA might be a smidge better, it's hard to play atop it with a bingo that doesn't already play along row 15. This outruns well enough though.

#note I played very poorly/carelessly and once again drew well enough to mask it.
