>Reid: AEINOPT H4 POINT +20 20
#note Exchanging O (53.03%) is #1, OPIATE (52.76%) is #2 at 8C and OP (51.88%) is #3. While I agree with Quackle that my racks is close to a bingo, I dont think my play is that bad. It must be the AE leave that Quackle doesn't like. I considered POINTE (#10, 50.71%). My play is #26 pased on valuations from all plays. In hindsight, I like OP best. I'm not a fan of fishing.
>Amit: DDIY 9E DIDY +22 22
#note RELANDED (76.85%), EXPANDER (76.43%), and REHANDLE (76.41%) at E4 are 1-3.
>Reid: ??AEENR 8H .ERrANEs +71 91
#note There are so many possibilities in this rack that the top three choices by Quackle vary. Double doubles at E4 are the best choices here and I didn't even bother to look there. My choice is #3 based on valuations from 50 choices. Quackle freezes up when evaluating all choices.
>Amit: DU 6F DU. +8 30
>Reid: BIINOOT N2 NIOBIT. +22 113
#note NIOBITE is #9 (78.73%). EOBIONT (81.86%) at N8 is #1. BIO (80.08%) at 8D is #2 and OBI (79.79%) at 8C is #3. 2 and 3 are more more style, but for some reason I just decided to play a longer word here.
>Amit: ASZ O1 ZAS +40 70
>Reid: HLMORWX F8 M.X +28 141
#note MIX (77.17%) is #4. WHOM (78.78%) at 8C, PHLOX (77.69%) at 4H, and WHOMP (77.31%) at 4D are 1-3. I really didn't want to part with my only vowel so I guess I didn't consider any plays that used it.
>Amit: DILOY E9 .OILY +27 97
>Reid: AHLORVW M3 WHA +39 180
#note #1 play.
>Amit: AERSTTU O8 .TATURES +74 171
>Reid: EGLORUV 5B VULGO +21 201
#note VULGO (58.87%) is #4. UNGLOVE (64.81%) at M7,  VELURE (61.18%) at 13C, and VOE (61.12%) at D10 are 1-3. 
>Amit: EFIORSW 13H FROWSIE. +80 251
>Reid: AEEFJRR 12B JAR. +22 223
#note JARL (22.80%) is #10. JAW (27.67%) and JEW (27.07%) at K11 are 1,2. JAY (26.81%) at 13C is #3. JARL (23.04%) at D2 is #9.
>Amit: AEEGNNP 15H PANGENE. +86 337
>Reid: EEFLRRT N10 FE +28 251
#note FE (0.95%) is #3. REFELL (1.31%) at D1 and FERAL (1.13%) at C9 are 1,2. Quackle assesses my chances of winning at this point as dismal.
>Amit: ADQS C3 SQ.AD +34 371
#note Amit continues his momentum.
>Reid: EELORRT 11C LO.TER +23 274
#note This is just sad. I see LOITER but fail to see LOITERER (3.18%). LOITER is #5 based on valuations from all plays.
>Amit: GHO 13A HOG +31 402
>Reid: ACEEIOR L1 COIR +37 311
#note COIR (0.00%) is #14. I was just thinking about reducing spread at this point. Quackle believes REOIL (#1, 2.58%) at D1 and OCREAE (#3, 0.83%) offer a glimmer of hope. AERIE (#2, 1.00%) doesn't seem to score enough to matter. My play is the highest scoring of the top 15.
>Amit: CI A13 .IC +24 426
>Reid: AAEEMTV K5 VEE. +12 323
#note TRAVE at J7, RAVE at K8, and VAR at J6 are top 3 plays. I wasn't really into playing the end game here. My play is #34 based on valuations from all plays. This is a stupid play.
>Amit: AKU 12K AUK +29 455
>Reid: ABEMT J6 MA.T +24 347
#note MART is #2. BARM is #1 and MARE is #3. At least I picked the right place.
>Amit: EILN I2 LIEN +11 466
>Amit:  (BE) +8 474
#note 7 of my 12 plays are in the top 10, but few are in the top 5. I missed a bingo. Overall I give myself a C this game.While the game was probably unwinnable, the spread didn't need to be so large.
