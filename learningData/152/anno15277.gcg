#note Alright, so second straight tournament where my first play is a phony. I figured it was worth a shot. But yeah, I realized this was not a word.

#note I missed SWANNED and honestly completely forgot it was a word. Pretty big miss.

#note With a more reliable S hook open, the sim gives a slight edge to fishing with 10I AA. It's also nice defense.

#note I might not be winning by enough to risk this cute play. It could easily backfire. I wouldn't have done it if I'd seem C6 ZEBU.

#note Dopy phonies aside (I wouldn't have played them against most players), this was a bit of a clumsy start to the tournament. I'm not please with my SWANNED miss, and my board vision was lacking when I whiffed on EYRIE and GHAT. And AZO was certainly a strategical letdown.
