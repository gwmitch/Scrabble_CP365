>Matt_Canik: BDEHISY 8G BY +14 14
#note Sim prefers BY B on the star.
>Ted_Barrett: ?IOORTT 9F TOO +14 14
#note Ted said "I had TORTONI with a blank N." Well ted, why didn't you play TORTONI then? Or TOROSIT(Y) for 83? Or even OOT for an extra point? 
>Matt_Canik: DEHIPSV 10H DEV +22 36
>Ted_Barrett: ?AIORRT K8 tRAITOR +70 84
#note ORATRIx is the play.

#note Good work ted

>Ted_Barrett: DEGILPS 13C GLIDE +22 106
#note Ted said this was his rack. 
>Matt_Canik: ADEEINO 14J O.EAD +25 192
#note I don't know if it's appropriate to open up an S hook this big with a lead. Its the equity play for sure, and BYS is likelu not getting blocked any time soon.

>Ted_Barrett: AEEKMOT I8 EK. +34 304
>Matt_Canik: ACIIILR 6F .IALI +9 275
#note I chose this play because with three Ns available, the C column is still quite friendly. Also, how the fuck did I draw the last three Is in the bag?
>Ted_Barrett: AEJMOTY N2 JO +24 328
#note JAM N1 is really nice, holds OY for next turn. Also JA(N)TY for 37. 
>Matt_Canik: CFIRUWW -CFUWW +0 275
#note FUWW is a perfect draw... said no one ever. There are no 7s or 8s with FUWW in them.

I threw back the C because there were very few vowels left so I wanted to keep as many consonants as possible, plus I wanted an extra shot at the blank. 
>Ted_Barrett: AEEMNTY 13M YA. +25 353
>Matt_Canik: IMNORRZ H4 ZO. +22 297
#note I just didn't know what to do here and essentially threw in the towel. Something like ZIN(E) probably gives me the best chnance, keeps AZINE open and the 2 row. Still, I think this game is lost at this point. 
>Ted_Barrett: EEEMNTW E3 EME +18 371
#note Idea: fork the board when winning by a bingo with an unseen blank. 
>Matt_Canik: ILMNRTT 2B TRIM +20 317

#note "My tracking was shit so I didn't want to empty the bag"
>Matt_Canik: CELNRWX J3 XEN.C +14 331
#note I think I'm going to draw the A for reasons I won't divulge.
