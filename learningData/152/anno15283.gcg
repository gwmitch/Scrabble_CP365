>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEGIRT 12D GRADE +19 335
#note I got too caught up in trying to keep Carl off a bingo that I missed the offensive opportunity of H1 GNOME. GRADE is really weak.
>Carl_Johnson: FGI 3B FI. +14 258
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ACINTUY E11 A.TY +14 349
#note Considering the biggest looming threat is the X, not a bingo, maybe I should forget blocking and go into outrace mode with 11E AYIN. Another weak play.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADEEILT 10B DELTA +20 390
#note I don't know what to do here. I decided to shorten the game. This only wins 62% apparently. Giving up possible HOLDINGS is a big no-no. All those dinky bingo blocking plays where I should have been racing really hurt me in the end.

>Carl_Johnson:  (EEI) +6 390
#note Obviously forgetting ALMUDES is bad, but I'm mostly worried about how awful my strategy was while holding a commanding lead. GRADE, ARTY, and DELTA were terrible. Very bad assessment of the biggest threats and figuring out how I was most likely to lose.
