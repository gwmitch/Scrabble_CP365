#note Leave values slowly sinking in over the course of several years. Also the A in VAVS is a possible bingo line, so shedding the A is better for that reason too.

#note I have just played FANEGA leaving E?. I go to draw my replenishment tiles and find that I have threaded my hand through the drawstring of the tile bag somehow, and am kind of stuck. When I try to get my hand out of there, I accidentally jerk the entire bag out of my other hand, sending it flying/spilling tiles out all over the floor. In shock at what I have done, I raise my hands above my head like an NBA player indicating that he has not committed a foul. Chris seems more amused than upset and quite reasonably calls for the director. John and Sherrie come over, scrounge around for all the loose tiles, and count them to ensure the right amount is inside. Then I try once again and successfully redraw my 5 tiles, which end up being FEDX? A little awkward, but not much to be done about it.
