>Geoff_Thevenot: ACINRS -  +0 0
#note Dunno what he exchanged, but I'm thinking he held ACINRS.
>Matt_Canik: AEEFJSV 8D JEFES +46 46
#note Even after the exchange 1, I think I have to play JEFES here.

#note Takinghe risk that he doesnt ave a T for TAXON and I'll score some big points next turn. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: BINRTUY A7 BUTYRIN +101 191
#note But he did. I also held this for a long time. 
>Matt_Canik: DMOOTTV D2 MOTTO +18 92
#note I think the board stays open more long-term after this.

#note Wahoo! I phoneyed Geoff! 

He held this for a while but let it go. I'd imagine it's #?
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEU 11I U.EA +22 344
#note ...or maybe I just gave him a 22-point counter. 
>Matt_Canik: GGIILRU -GGIILU +0 160
#note I just exchanged out of frustration.

>Matt_Canik: AEFNRSW --  -113 160
#note This is pretty much my only chance to get back into the game, but Geoff was having none of it. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EPT B6 TEP. +16 425
>Matt_Canik: AEFNRSW 4K WAFER +38 198
#note I'd imagine he's close to something after a play like TEPA. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEIIIRT O4 .ETIARII +74 499
#note ugh.

#note Things get weird here. Geoff checks to see how many are in the bag and accidentally pulls the remaining tile out. He doesn't see it. I say "I'd be fine if you put it back in the bag" but he said "no, I should punish myself, I should check the rules". He checks them and misreads what they say, so we treat it as a standard overdraw, except I have to turn over the one he pulled out of the bag. Well, as luck would have it, the blank was in the bag. Obviously, I put it back in the bag. 

The ruling was messed up, though. Geoff is supposed to let me pick two more of my tiles and from there, I get to place one of MY OWN tiles back in the bag and keep what was in the bag if I so choose. We misinterpreted them. 

I am certain Geoff didn't mean anything malicious in this (even though he was playing and directing at the same time). 

As it turns out, even without the knowledge of the blank in the bag, I think Geoff would still make this play. But he spent a long time before he did it...
>Matt_Canik: BGIIKOY H12 .I.K +24 294
#note Which makes me think he sees bingos along both 3 and 15. I spent some time looking for bingos in both spots and came up with a few convincing-sounding phoneys to play in both spots, but somehow overlooked CHAIReD along 3, so I didn't take the time to block it. CHAIReD is the only playable bingo he's got. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ?ACDHIR 3F CHAIReD +76 606
#note And thus, this is how you lose by 333.
