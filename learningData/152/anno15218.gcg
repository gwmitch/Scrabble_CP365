#note Will: Maybe PUTT, DMNY is much more synergetic.

#note Will: Wading through this can't be productive...need SX? urgently.

#note 5E?
>Will_Anderson: AEEEPTU 8M .UE +11 176
#note No good board forks available. Not sure what I can realistically do here.
>Noah: AACEOOS D8 CO.ES +26 296
#note No, it's not a good leave, but I like what it does for the board.
>Will_Anderson: AEEFOPT 8A EPA.T +27 203
>Noah: AAEGLMO 9A LOG. +23 319
#note Continuing to block. I liked this over MOA because of the consonant heavy pool and score.
>Will_Anderson: EFHKOTY F9 H.OKEY +24 227
#note I play this in full confidence of its validity and its noun-ness, and passing up KYTHE; maybe I need to pour on as many points as I can and hope for a 9 through IN or to open more effectively later.
>Noah: AAEEMTW E13 MAW +17 336
>Will_Anderson: ?EFILTT N8 ..IT +10 237
#note If Noah challenges, I get LEFTIST/HOOKEYS for almost 100; after MAW G13, I would have had SWIFTLET for 100+. Here I am trying for FLATLINED/FLATLINER/FLATLINES.
>Noah: AEEEEST 12J SETAE +15 351
#note I think I should play this or TEASE here. As much as I like keeping the S, blocking the UNIT hook seems important. I didn't see that this set up GOXES. I'm not sure if that makes it better or worse. If he plays GOXES it forces him to use his last E which is somewhat helpful, and he might not even be able to play it. Hm. I think I should play TEASE here. Actually, thinking about it, I'm not sure why I played SETAE at all.

>Will_Anderson: ?BJLMNT K5 J.B +24 302
>Noah: ADEEOST 15C TA.SED +50 433
#note Maybe I should do something else. Like READ G10. See, I held HOOKEY and wasn't sure it was good. Maybe he can come back if he challenges it off. Another play, like READ, saves HOOKEYS so I can maybe play it later with more sureness, while also not opening lanes for Will. 
>Will_Anderson: ?ILMRTU -  +0 302
#note Will: Can't win if it's good, but I am nearly certain it is - given that, my already slightly subpar spread really needed protecting.

>Noah: BCDORRT A4 CORB.. +13 474
#note Thought about RUNTILy* but didn't like it. REDO is two better.
>Will_Anderson: ?ILNRTU 14J RUTIN +19 329
#note Best play is LIRa 3G.
>Noah: DRT 11C R.D. +21 495
