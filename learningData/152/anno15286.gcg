#note Yikes, disaster situation as he blocks everything. Quackle is talking about exchanges, but I thought it was important to open a lane. Kind of a big mistake betwen POSTER is a much better leave.

#note I missed a number of better plays, but they all kind of float around and nothing is clearcut. L12 BOIL apparently gives me the best win%, but I don't see how.

#note All-around clumsy game and a well-deserved loss. Word knowledge costs me essentially two lost turns in a row (since I am forced to fish after my bingoes are blocked) and I blew chances to win after that despite getting the tiles. Yuck! Now I'm 8-2 with two very winnable losses. Suffice it to say I was drawing quite well at the start of the tournament.
