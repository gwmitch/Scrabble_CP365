#note OK, let's block the double word to setup a triple word score!  I put it down so quickly.  Devestating.  
>katya: DEX 10H DEX +65 81
#note Major blunder.  Yap was an obvious X play and I got an open up a triple letter.

#note I needed to chill thought this might clear some vowels and stop an easy s play.

#note officially lost the game right here.  Still not sure what word I was thinking of.  Should have just kept grinding it out with maybe varier or something.

#note Wish I had seen RE(D)ARGuE 13B in time.  She says she would have challenged.  Then I drew the other blank the next turn.  I really wonder if that would be the case.  AEEGRR? are really workable tiles.  And a U would have been floating over the triple letter and triple word.  If the she had the Q that she plays 2 turns from now, I would be sensible just to let the bingo go and play QuIT or whatever for 66 pts and neutralizing the bingo.

#note Need to learn new words! Don't know TABAnID I know lABIAT(E)D though.  A tabanid is a bloodsucking insect. I'm capable of labiated, and considering she drew crap near the end I might have fought back into it.
