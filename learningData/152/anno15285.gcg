>Scott: ?AEEHNR A8 .REtHANE +92 148
#note There was a better play, but I had wasted a bunch of time on the first couple plays, so I didn't look for one after happily spotting URETHANE.
>Noah: AGUV D4 VAGU. +18 173
>Scott: AINORTZ 6B ZI. +33 181
#note I definitely thought playing away from the P was right to keep extra bingo lines open, since I'm keeping a strong leave.  Quak prefers TOPAZ, which is fine, but it's not how I generally play when the smell of a bingo is in the air.
>Noah: EIK 12A .IKE +22 195
>Scott: AALNORT 3E RAT.ONAL +60 241
#note bad job on my part not spotting PATRONAL.  and i think it was laziness, because i'm pretty sure i would have had RATIONAL not been there for me.  
RATIONAL proves good to me in one way though...
>Noah: EILNOST K1 EL.TIONS +66 261
#note I fell asleep on PATRONAL, opp missed the E hook I had just set up.

#note I found this a very tough position.  Quak likes VOYAGE 14E best, which is surprising. Though it does turn over 5 tiles, key with SSS? still to come. I think its second choice of TONEY 4K is more tempting.  YEA sims rather far back.

#note Another tough call.  At this point I'll only win if I bingo and he does not.  So I opt to keep the board open by playing JET.  Turns out to not be a great call--sim suggests I should play 3 tiles to get an extra chance at the blank even if it makes the board a little more blockable.  JIMP and JISM are apparently best
>Noah: BEEIRSU M8 .EBURIES +72 475
#note Given my position in the tourney, spread was meaningless here.  Gotta challenge and play for the win, even though I was about 98% sure it was good.
>Scott: ?EILPSS -  +0 365
#note i challenged.  REBURIES was good.  bad spread!
