#note PANDY is another option, but I prefer giving him less tiles to work with. Wasn't sure whether giving up the DWS with S hooks was appropriate, but change 5 doesn't really imply an S. 
>Doug_Riblet: ILLN 9I NILL +12 12
>Matt_Canik: ADEKLNR 7F LAND +22 40
#note Spent a really long time here. Nothing is astounding. LAND opens up this board, and Doug is a strong player on closed boards. 

Q prefers his to all the other options by over 2 points.

>Doug_Riblet: IQS 14K QIS +24 57
>Matt_Canik: CDEJMNO 12J JOC. +34 156
#note I deliberated between this and JOCKED* for a while. Glad I opted out of that play. 
>Doug_Riblet: ?CEENOR N1 ENfORCE +80 137
>Matt_Canik: DEGIMNW 1J WING.D +36 192
#note Paranoid after getting 3x3ed twice at nationals. MEW(E)D seems stronger if I want to block that spot, holding GIN. 
>Doug_Riblet: FHO O7 FOH +33 170
>Matt_Canik: EGIMSTW E4 TWIG +23 215
#note I spent a long time on this turn, and I'm really glad I did. WIG in the same spot is also a decent option, but with a lead and a modrately strong leave, I'm content not  gambling with the new hook spots. 
>Doug_Riblet: ?ABDERU 4E .URBAnED +76 246
>Matt_Canik: AEEILMS 15G ELEMI +32 247
#note Awful. I talked myself out of MEALIES. 

There's no way I deserve my rating. 
>Doug_Riblet: FOX N11 FOX +45 291
>Matt_Canik: AINORSS H1 SNO. +18 265
#note We're approaching the point where I need a bingo or a big Z-play to win this game. This opens up a line that he can't block without sacrificing a ton of points and leaves the board nice and open, and still holds an S for 8A if outrunning becomes the strategy here. 
>Doug_Riblet: AEEUV 2E AVE.UE +26 317
>Matt_Canik: AAIRSUZ 8A IZARS +54 319
#note Oh wow that was a fast Z draw. 
>Doug_Riblet: ABINR 1A BRAIN +26 343
#note Doug's really low on time right now, which means an endgame is tilted highly in my favor. 
>Matt_Canik: AEITUVY 9B AY +29 348
#note If Doug has PE or OP I'm screwed, but if he doesn't then I think this puts me in a really good position- 3 in the bag and a slight lead. 
>Doug_Riblet: AHP 14G PAH +19 362
#note Phew. He drew EO after this play. 
>Matt_Canik: EIMTTUV B1 .IVET +16 364
#note This appears to outrun everything to me. (ZA)RATITE for him will win next turn though, which I didn't notice until just now. Thankfully he's under 0:20 left and didn't have time to see it either. 
>Doug_Riblet: AEIORTT 13G OAT +21 383
>Matt_Canik: MTU 5I MUT +19 383
#note Phew.
