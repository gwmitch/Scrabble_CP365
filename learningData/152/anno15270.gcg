>Joshua_Sokol: ABEIMPY H8 EMBAY +32 32
#note PYEMIA.
>Stephen_Sneed: IORRU 8D OURI. +6 6
#note He laid down OURARI and then kept the R.
>Joshua_Sokol: HIINOPT 12C POINT. +22 54
>Stephen_Sneed: ??AMNOR E3 eNAMO.Rs +66 72
#note I blocked a lot of his pointy plays :P
>Joshua_Sokol: AHHIOTZ D3 HATH +37 91
#note I like this because it gives me points next turn, almost guaranteed.
>Stephen_Sneed: ABRV G4 BRAV. +14 86
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIOOUZ H1 OUZO +47 138
#note Like here :)
>Stephen_Sneed: ADINR I2 NADIR +27 113
>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEEIS -EE +0 138
#note I think my thought process was something along the lines of I didn't want him to know what I had at all and I didn't want to open something for him by playing EE, but I should just score, I think.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACCEILS 13H SCALIC +39 177
>Joshua_Sokol: ACCEILS --  -39 138
#note Why? I didn't need to do this...
>Stephen_Sneed: AX B13 AX +38 161
>Joshua_Sokol: ACCEILS 3B AC.. +16 154
#note Hoping this setup will work
>Stephen_Sneed: EF 15A FE +25 186
>Joshua_Sokol: CEEIILS A1 LICE +32 186
#note it did, but I'm not in a good position...
>Stephen_Sneed: EFN B2 F.NE +26 212
>Joshua_Sokol: EIJKSWY 10B JEW. +29 215
#note whoawhoawhoa, (AN)Y(BOD)IES? I should have seen that, even though it's the wrong play...
>Stephen_Sneed: ENS J3 SEN +24 236
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKSVY K5 KIVA +36 251
#note I don't understand why SKIVE sims better here, as I'm pretty sure he has another S and I need to keep mine
>Stephen_Sneed: DDIOORS 9H .IRS +19 255
#note Jeez
>Joshua_Sokol: DELOSTY 13H STYLED +35 286
#note OLDY looks great here. He might think I'm setting up a hook that doesn't exist and he might be scared and try hooking it with a G or something.
>Stephen_Sneed: DEIRSTU M6 STURDIE. +62 317
#note Ouch. Well STYLED blocked STUDIER at least.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGILOW L12 W.EL +26 312
#note Here's where I need to set up points for myself because I really don't know how to win besides Q sticking him or bingoing through the L. This wins the sim, but I'm still in trouble.
>Stephen_Sneed: DEG 8K .G.ED +27 344
#note I held this, didn't like it, but dismissed it since I didn't have the Q and he was likely going to draw it. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGINP 15J PA.ING +27 339
#note I don't remember my last tile here. I don't know what the best way to score the most points is, but this worked out.
>Stephen_Sneed: ELOOQTT 14I OE +16 360
#note LOTTO is best here, but he wasn't sure of what I had.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGO N4 EGO +10 349
