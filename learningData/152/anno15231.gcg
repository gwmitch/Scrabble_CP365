>Jesse_Matthews: DILOORT 8F IDOL +10 10
#note This is one of those times where you wish you were going second and get the tile you need for an 8 from your opponent (A or C here). Quackle likes a varity of plays using both Os here. I don't understand...why?
>Leesa_Berahovich: MOW 7F MOW +22 22
>Jesse_Matthews: ??DORTY 6G sTROYeD +70 80
#note I see F4 DoR(MI)TOrY for 67 here and correctly pass on it. The equally common DefOR(MI)TY for 77 is neck and neck with 6H ThYROiD for 77. Both are better than my play.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AHOY 5J HOYA +42 64
#note Comeback plays like these are precisely why I can't be missing best plays, even if 2 blanks are involved. Something for me to work on.
>Jesse_Matthews: ADINNTT 4K TAD +29 109
>Leesa_Berahovich: BO 7J BO +19 83
>Jesse_Matthews: INNNSTX F7 ..NX +29 138
>Leesa_Berahovich: AEIN 10F .ENIA +14 97
>Jesse_Matthews: INNNRST -NNR +0 138
#note Suggested better plays are J9 N(A)N 3, Exch. NN and I10 (I)NN 3. Perhaps the two three point play suggestions are due to the current nature of the board, but I don't see the need to play them. Leesa's play suggests that her tiles are decent one-pointers, so I'd rather allow her the opportunity to bingo and open the board here post-exchange than set up a hook for her for three points and have the board be totally screwed up. As for the exchange option, I'm always paranoid about holding on to so many consonants, so I'm not sure why holding onto INRST is better than holding onto INST.
>Leesa_Berahovich: CEIKLNO 8K NE +11 108
#note This looks extremely fishy.
>Jesse_Matthews: EFILNST K10 LIFT +27 165
#note The duck prefers fishing the F on the board somewhere. I'm still paranoid about the board getting shut down after a bingo hooking NE or underlapping XENIA in some way. I figured LIFT accomplished scoring and keeping the board open. Am I too paranoid?
>Leesa_Berahovich: ELPRU 12H PUR.LE +28 136
>Jesse_Matthews: ELNQSSU M9 QUE.N +48 213
#note QUE(E)NS sims about the same here. Given all the Es to make -LESS words and the nature of this board, I don't mind keeping an extra S right now.
>Leesa_Berahovich: CKO H12 .OCK +36 172
>Jesse_Matthews: CGLSSVW -CGLVW +0 213
>Leesa_Berahovich: AEP J12 .APE +14 186
>Jesse_Matthews: BEIISSS 14F BI.E.S +26 239
#note Quackle suggests 14J (P)SIS for 29 and N9 IS for 19 over my play. IS is crazy after her last play, not happening. PSIS scores a few points more than my play and keeps things locked down, but I'm scared of -IC bingos in Row 14. I feel my play forces her to break up her rack to keep up with me in scoring, or fish somewhere on the right side of the board. With two more esses after my play, I feel like I'm well in control of the board.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AEIRTT 15A RATITE +25 211
>Jesse_Matthews: AGHILSS 14A AH +22 261
#note 14B HIS for 26 is much better than my play. At the time I was concerned with blocking, but AH allows for a lot of -ST bingos in Column C so I'm not really blocking at all.
>Leesa_Berahovich: GIMR N7 GRIM +34 245
>Jesse_Matthews: EGILRSS O8 ES +24 285
#note I'm concerned about a potential play of O6 JOES for 56 points here. Quackle suggests 14F (BICEPS)ES for 29, which I'm not a fan of. I'd rather remove the potential for huge nonbingo plays and give myself a chance at a comeback play if she bingos in Column C next turn.
>Leesa_Berahovich: AEGU 13B AGUE +16 261
>Jesse_Matthews: EGILRSU C10 GLE. +6 291
#note Right thinking, wrong vowel. For god knows what reason I put down the E instead of the U. GLU(G) is way better. This has the potential to be a game losing play.
>Leesa_Berahovich: ORW N12 ROW +26 287
>Jesse_Matthews: CINORSU O13 ROC +23 314
>Leesa_Berahovich: ADEEJST E11 JE. +20 307
>Jesse_Matthews: AEFINSU 15L FUS. +20 334
>Jesse_Matthews: AEFINSU --  -20 314
#note Here's where I make an intentional mistake, but I'm probably wrong for doing so. I'm very concerned with the two Vs and the Z still in the pool. There's a good spot at 13A for one V, but drawing two Vs would be devastating here. If I drew two I'd need my A and my I to dump them in one turn, so I need to get rid of my U. I see FUS(C) as a reasonable phony. If it's challenged off, great, I'm not drawing into the Vs. If it stays on and I draw the Vs, also cool, I'll deal with them next turn with VIVA or VIVAS. 
>Leesa_Berahovich: ADNSTVZ 13A V.... +15 322
>Jesse_Matthews: AEFINSU 15L FIS. +20 334
#note Now that one V is down, I'm ok with playing FISC and emptying the bag.
>Leesa_Berahovich: ADINSTZ 9D ZI. +12 334
>Jesse_Matthews: AENSTU 11A TE. +3 337
#note Having spent way too much time trying to figure out the pre-endgame, I'm down to about 20 seconds here and I make an absolutely awful play. This gives her a winning play of DAVI(T) but...
>Leesa_Berahovich: ADINV A8 DIN. +15 349
#note ...she plays DIN(T) instead.
>Jesse_Matthews: ANSU N1 ANUS +13 350
#note I need to leave more time on my clock for endgames. That one was absolutely abysmal and I got extremely lucky.
>Jesse_Matthews:  (AV) +10 360
