#note This is the opposite of game 29: I'm fairly certain this game means significantly more to Will than to me, even if I hadn't just dropped 4 straight.  2nd through 10th really just means a different sized check.
>Will: ?ADENPS E3 PENDAn.S +70 84
#note I see SPAVINED but worry about the hotspots and continue searching for 4x'es. I correctly decide not to pull the trigger on UNPASTED* but eventually get frustrated and play this and forget about SPAVINED. I really wish I were joking.
>Kenji: CNRTUVW 4A CURV.T +28 48
#note I thought I had an R instead of an N, but that looks impossible.  Definitely had a consonant so this is my rack by process of elimination.
>Will: ?AIOPRS A1 PIS.AtOR +149 233
#note At this point I have realized that there is pretty much no chance I will ever draw this well at Nationals again, and I should just accept that and try to get better for future years. I imagine there were about 10+ other players in the field who would have won this tournament drawing this way.

#note At this point, Will needed spread, and I wanted to go home.  On the one hand, I wish I would've tried a little harder here rather than throwing this down in 5 seconds, whereas if the spread meant something this is a 5 minute rack.  On the other hand, I really wish tournaments wouldn't put completely demoralized players in positions where they have a major influence on who finishes where.
