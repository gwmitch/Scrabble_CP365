#note Carolyn Atchinson strikes again!  I was well aware of Carolyn's win over Joey Maliick at the New Orleans open.  So she is capable of pulling off a big win.  Clearly my 5th seed to her 122th mean nothing.  Still not sure why I didn't draw the 134th seed instead.  I thought swiss pairing went 5th highest vs. 5th lowest for the first game.  Anyway, the warning signs were on the wall.  

I basically talked myself out of feting.  And thought I could bingo in the immediate future.

#note Clearly I need to study 3's because I challenged dol.  A dol is a unit of intensity.  I guess I didn't get that far in chemistry.

#note She takes a long time on this turn...she flashes the g on the triple letter, then she switches it out with the Z to play zingy! Is this really happening?!?

#note Not sure what to do...I need a bingo fast.  I have the case s and might be able to luck out on the triple word...

#note Just like EXUENT versus Mallick, BARBY slipped under the radar.  Only Barbie is valid folks.

#note There you have it.  When I make that many blunders I deserve to lose.  Forgoing a bingo, challenging a 3 and failing to challenge/notice a phony.
