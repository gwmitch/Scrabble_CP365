#note This is the key decision.  I think I still like this line but there are other lines that are admittedly reasonable, especially if I want to avoid shootouts (which I do, both for tournament position and because of my opponent).
>Will: EELOORT G1 RETOOLE. +61 61
#note Just for what it's worth, Will and I do not like the fact we're playing each other at this point.  We were rooming together and had gotten to know each other pretty well over this tournament, especially once I thought it was okay to talk about real life stuff once Will was "out of the tournament" (Will won 18 of his last 20).  It always sucks especially when one person has so much more to gain than the other.
>Kenji: DEEIIRZ 4F I.DIZER +38 60
#note I am not happy.  Almost all of whatever strategic edge I had on Will basically just flew away.  I am now behind in a word knowledge/board vision war, which at an even score is somewhere around a coin flip.

#note Nice to see that my technical knowledge still means something.

#note Dagger.  I'll admit I started tearing up when I saw this play.

#note I love you dude, but please, one time, tell me you just got the ugliest draw you have ever seen in your entire life.

#note 4 off of 10D AFOUL and M7 EYE
>Kenji: EKNORTV 10L .OKE +20 456
#note I have no idea what I was doing, especially since I saw OKEH.  I did miss VENEER, but I think I just got frustrated and put something down.  I do have Nigel in pretty good shape in spread at this point, but more would've helped incrementally.
