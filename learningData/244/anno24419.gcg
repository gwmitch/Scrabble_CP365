#note cool, a closed board scenario - definitely something I need more practice with. oftentimes in these positiions it's really important to cover spots right away that both of you have easy access to. in thise case it's super easy to score at 14B, so blocking that with something like JEEP/JIMP or just playing EX are preferable.

#note I was really hoping I might draw MENHIR at 14F for 40 with an R. failing that, this play sets up more points on A12 (MEGILP if I see it)

#note MEGILP is a pretty awesome play at the same spot.

#note bold play on his end. would help a lot if I had a stronger response. I thought about AGO here also, but there are too many Is remaining for me to feel comfortable.

#note not sure what to do from here other that open and pray. Perhaps AGGIE to make the board more open, but I didn't like the fact that it would give back such cheap points. that said, I have to take a chance on something, and hoping that the vowels are in the bag is as reasonable a gamble to take as any.

#note gotta block KORAI, but spending my vowel leaves me very vulnerable to setups. CLEF is the play I was looking for.
