#note BRAVO keeps much stronger leave.
>Lloyd_Mills: DOQ C7 Q.OD +25 67
>JD: EFIIRVX H4 FIXI. +19 64
#note a lot of competitive options, from RIVAGE setting up XI to just VERB or BRIEF. I like FIXIT because his rack is probably better than average (he's been building for 3 turns), and it closes up the board while increasing my chances of bingoing faster.
>Lloyd_Mills: CEIPR D3 PRECI. +35 102
>JD: CEKMRVZ 5C Z.K +32 96
#note quackle likes sacrificing a few points this turn with VERB, which closes an easy scoring spot on row 15 and saves the Z to score with next turn.
>Lloyd_Mills: ?AEINOS 15A NIO.AtES +131 233
#note guess that was an extreme example of why VERB might've been right!

>JD: EEFNUWY C12 EF +28 284
#note I guess I have a chance...running out of time with hard moves earlier. quackle likes FEU at C1. getting rid of the U certainly helps the leave.
>Lloyd_Mills: ADEHILN N7 INHALED +65 354
>JD: EHNTUWY 3A WHU. +24 308
#note not really sure why I didn't just take the points for HEWN here - I guess it seemed like UTY was never going to lead to a win whereas at least ENTY might bingo. still should take points.
>Lloyd_Mills: JLOW O4 JOWL +25 379
#note his turn to make a very strange defensive play!

#note ATONY to block DADA
