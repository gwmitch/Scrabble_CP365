#note given my excellent draw I actually have a chance if I can draw a blank...

#note unfortunately, didn't know VESSAIL which would've made life easy. Instead chose between SEV and VET. While the points of SEV are appealing, I felt that the E hook after VET would require Nick to sacrifice a lot of points to block, and I still have a shot at bingoing on row 14. probably SEV is the play in retrospect.

>JD: ?EEILSS 15F tIELESS +82 331
#note the problem with VET now is that I'm going to have to block unless I have the blank...hence why taking the points for SEV earlier might have been preferable (if I do bingo, I have a decent lead and can block with impunity)

>JD: AAGGIKL L1 GAG.. +10 341
#note desperation try to block the EVET hook under time pressure, but likely not good enough, and may not even win even if the blank is in the bag. Quackle advises just playing KAI and praying he doesn't bingo, but he was under some time pressure and I didn't want to give him row 2.

#note the win is in my grasp! all I ahve to do is play BLAG saving KI...or any other play that blocks RULERING#. I know RULERING, was just uncertain given spread that I could still win if I blocked, and therefore gave him another shot.
