#note Sacrificing a few points to play this in a safer way, rather than starting on the A column or playing from 7H, which would give the T hook to the O column. I asked Komol afterwards which he would have done, and he liked my choice, though 7H is reasonable too.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: DOY 8A DOY +30 56
>Dave_Koenig: AEEHMRU 10A HAME +31 100
#note A few similarly scoring plays here, but I liked this better than 7H HEAUME, for example, both to keep the dynamic ER and not to open too much for him.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: EIKRS A10 .IKERS +54 110
>Dave_Koenig: EIMORUU 11D MEOU +20 120
#note A tricky choice here. I like playing in the 11E spot better than playing at 7H, which needlessly gives him letters to bingo through and exposes the 8O triple.  He might not have huge scoring potential on this board, which gives me time to untangle from my vowel heavy rack.  I considered playing 11 EUOI, sacrificing a few points to keep a better MRU leave instead of IRU, but I didn't like giving so many hooks at 12D, which was likely to be his highest scoring spot on the board. RUMOUR 14A is an interesting choice that I didn't think of. Though it allows row 15 underlaps, he has to have an E to hit the spot. And if he does not, I might be able to use my E on the next turn.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ALPST H11 SPLAT +37 147
#note Komol had another S and was able to make a big score on this board, but this is nothing to fret about. The key thing is that I left him a board where he had to burn his S to make a good score.
>Dave_Koenig: ACEIRTU 15F UR.ICATE +61 181
#note He blocked my higher scoring SURICATE, but at least I still bingo.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: IIII -IIII +0 147
>Dave_Koenig: AEGIOPT 13F PI.OTAGE +76 257
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ACEN 7F ACNE +33 180
>Dave_Koenig: EENRRTV 14J EVERT +40 297
#note A nervy play. This seems to take a big risk, in giving whoever draws the final S a big advantage with the O column hook. However, nothing else scores close to this spot. The points are too good to pass up.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: IRZ 6D RIZ +63 243
>Dave_Koenig: FFINRUW C3 RIFF +36 333
#note This was a word knowledge failure on my part. I knew I wanted to play one of NIFF, NUFF, RIFF, or RUFF in this spot, and I would much rather not keep the U with the W. Also, there are four N's unseen and only one R. However, I felt unsure of all of those fours except for RIFF. (I spent a lot more time studying the fives before the tournament, and could have told you for sure RUFFE was good, but I couldn't remember if it was good without the E.)  On the positive side, there are a few more I's to draw and only one other U, while the Q is still unseen, so there is some value in keeping the U. Furthermore, if I do draw the Q, I have just set myself up for QUIN 4A. And the UN combination is better than the UR combination, though there is obviously a risk of getting multiple N's here.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: DDELNRU 6I RUNDLED +73 316
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ?EEIILN (challenge) +5 321
#note This seemed a little funny to me, because I didn't think RUNDLE was a verb. I was right. RUNDLED is an adjective only, and NURDLING has no anagram. Funny enough, it was in my cardbox, last quizzed 144 days ago and just came due up during the tournament. If I had been studying during the tournament days, I would have seen it again.
>Dave_Koenig: AANOUVW O5 A.OWN +27 360
#note This is a big miss. VODUN for 39 was a much better play. I did not want to play DOWNA because it opens up the N10 spot for a big J play.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ?EEIILN L4 sI.ELINE +68 389
>Dave_Koenig: AGILNUV 2A VUG +26 386
#note No spot for my bingo. I have VAILING for a few more points here, but I didn't like that way of playing for a few reasons. Though I take a one point lead, he has tempo in the position, and there is a good chance he just drew at least one of the J or Q and will be able to score with it. (And even if not, he might have a good play from A1 to the V.) With the remaining tile pool and my AILN leave, I have a better chance of bingoing than he does, so it seems worth rolling the dice to hit something on row 3 or 4.
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: JNO 4A JO.N +38 427
>Dave_Koenig: AILNOQS K9 QIN +41 427
>Komol_Panyasophonlert: ABEGOTY 5G BOGY +27 454
#note Komol worked his clock down to less than a minute here, and came up with this play, which is one of his better ones. Unfortunately for him, there is no play making the WEMB hook that uses enough of his tiles.
>Dave_Koenig: ALOST O11 LOTSA +27 454
>Dave_Koenig:  (challenge) +5 459
#note Komol and I both thought he had a won game, because my out play of SOLATE N1 does not score enough to catch him, and my high scoring play of KATS 12A will lose to EAT/JOINT. However, on further examination I saw the higher scoring out play for LOTSA, which I thought was good, but felt a bit unsure. (It was just added in 2015. I didn't remember LOAST, which was already in the dictionary and would also have won.) But I needed to go for it to win, and when Komol challenged it, I was so nervous. The computer ruled it acceptable, and I pumped my fist in victory. I was so excited by this win that I was practically shaking during my entire lunch break over the next hour.
