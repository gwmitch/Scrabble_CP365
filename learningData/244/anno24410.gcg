>Seth_Lipkin: ADS N10 ADS +24 238
#note uh, I should probably block row 14
>JD: CDEEIOR M2 ECO +13 218
#note since seth clearly has some ammo in his leave, I felt like it was really important to create a counterthreat that could be troublesome.
>Seth_Lipkin: AFST 2J FAT.S +32 270
#note I guess he has the case S too
>JD: DDEILOR 1H DOILED +44 262
#note although LOIDED is an extra point, DOILED allows bingos on row 2, which actually increases my bingo percentage noticeably on this anemic board.
>Seth_Lipkin: ELOORSW 14A WOOLERS +79 349
>JD: CFIKMRR A13 C.M +30 292
#note I played CWM to buy time more than anything else - prevent seth from cheap points at 15A, score a few, get to score next turn and hopefully figure out a strategy from there. MURK at 5K actually leaves reasonable letters although the pool is awful.
>Seth_Lipkin: AEY 14M AYE +26 375
>JD: FIKRRTZ 5K T.RK +24 316
#note sim prefers FILK or KAF 11E, neither of which are going anywhere fast. then again I suppose neither is FIRZ. maybe just TIZ for max points?
>Seth_Lipkin: EIOTUW D9 OUTWI.E +22 397
#note turns over tiles nicely, but he just gave me a nice lane!
>JD: AAFIIRZ 3G ZARF +36 352
#note path to victory dubious. Q thinks my best chance is to play FIAT and fish fir ZINGARO/ZINGARI/ZINGARE (odds: 12/220) - not a bad try at all! Would've been cool to think of it over the board, although ZINGARI is fairly likely to get blocked since it would only fit at E3.
>Seth_Lipkin: OV H3 .VO +10 407
>JD: AGIIINX C12 AX.N +47 399
#note slightly better to start with GIN at 7G threatening IXIA.
>Seth_Lipkin: EHINNP E7 INN +5 412
>JD: GIII G9 GI +16 415
>Seth_Lipkin: EHP C7 PEH +25 437
#note all things considered, I think I kept the spread close here. Too bad I missed the nigel play of FIAT.
