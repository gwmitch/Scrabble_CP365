#note Lipe sips his coffee. is a comeback on the cards? maybe not, as Lipe shakes his head. Sims agree with only a 2.12% winning chance

#note Quackle Championship Player's Best: 6A FALX 38 (100.00 Win%)

Quackle suggests now that Lipe has minimal chance of winning.

Vicary's play block the opportunity of a 9-timer comeback from Lipe.

#note Looks like Vicary will only lose Lipe has a bonus... (unless he plays O4 HA(L)FEN 48 or O4 FE(L)TY 45).

Quackle Championship Player's Best as above.

#note No win for Lipe. SOZ was in the bag and maybe he almost had the optimum draw.
