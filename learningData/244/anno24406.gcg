#note rafi had ST with this. PROTEGEE would've allowed MYC leaving ERST

#note Rafi is still going to be up a tempo, so I wanted to create a new lane to play on row 6 (TENTERING and such)

>JD: ADEIKNS 13F .A.K +25 219
#note there was a shortage of one-point consonants in the bag, as well as Es, so I figured I should hold onto my good leave instead of cashing in with SKIED.
>Rafi_Stern: AGOT 12K .AGOT +20 260
#note fortunately I put rafi in a tough spot where he can't do all that much to block.

#note ridiculous J? draw leaves me in commanding shape.

>JD: ?EEIISX N5 EX +50 335
#note a further embarassment of riches. I thought about SILEX burning the blank for 29 more, but the pool is really weak, and I preferred to try to bingo myself.
>Rafi_Stern: ?BHLU 4L BUHL +33 326
#note the downside of not burning the blank - the pool is full of clunky consonants that he might be able to use to score well if I only draw crap the rest of the way.
