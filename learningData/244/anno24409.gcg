#note for some reason I foolishly excahnged both As instead of just one. ACEINS combines great with vowels. No reason not to exchange A!

#note a conservative play I can make here is TWEE at 14J - keeping the B sucks, but the flipside is that putting the W into the triple lane gives Muffin extra points. If the board were more open then ditching the B would be a more pressing need.

#note so many vowels. I can also just play OUR, but with a reasonable number of unseen Es decided to take the points. the bingo differential is about 32% to 42%.

>JD: CDGILNR O2 DING +22 269
#note I had 5 turns to draw a bingo, but couldn't do it, and now things are bad. YEZ is pretty alarming because of overlaps on row 10, although YEZ is so many points that he doesn't have to have an A yet. In retrospect, I probably need to bingo to win and should keep column O open. I shied away from ENGILD at B9 because it would lead Matt score easily at A12, but I'm at the point where I need the variance, and that way I would have two lanes to hit (G8 and O2). They sim even but I'm sure ENGILD is the play.
