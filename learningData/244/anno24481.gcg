>Aabid_Ismail: AWX 7F WAX +28 52
>Kevin_Bowerman: EINRRYY L9 EYRY +22 101
#note Can't read much from his rack after WAX, so he could have kept bingo tiles or scoring tiles. I figured that it was more likely he would have had a scoring play at A8 after EYRY 9D than that he would have a bingo. I also liked my prospects of bingoing next turn with INR and an open G. A sim disagrees with me, and thinks I should have taken 4 extra points at 9D.
>Aabid_Ismail: AEHNORS M3 HOARSEN +78 130
>Kevin_Bowerman: INORSST I8 .ISTRONS +62 163
#note He blocks RIN(G)TOSS, TORSI(o)NS and NOSTRI(L)S with his last play, so I am forced to bingo for 62 and open up a huge scoring spot on which he is unlikely to give me a scoring spot back. EYRY 9D would have worked out much better for me here, depriving him of a bingo, forcing him to find NOAH#, and then bingoing either with T(O)RSIONS B7, or a bingo on rows 3-5. Such is life.
>Aabid_Ismail: CINQ 15E CINQ. +48 178
>Kevin_Bowerman: EFOPTUW 12D TWOFE. +26 189
#note Hated WOF N2, but WOF 6E is far stronger. POUFTE(R)# is also better than this in every way, as is OUTWEP(T).
>Aabid_Ismail: EFNO 13C FOEN +23 201
>Kevin_Bowerman: GIIMPUV N1 GIMP +29 218
#note I played this far too quickly. With such a close game and such a closed board, I should continue the pressure of a closed board with VIG(S) or VUG(S), to keep a solid leave for scoring and keep him from scoring.
>Aabid_Ismail: AEIIRR O4 AIRIER +27 228
#note Without GIMP on the board he would be scoring hardly any points with this rack, and keeping lots of 1 pointers. I should have recognized on GIMP just how few >1 point tiles are left and blocked the 11E spot, the best place to score with low value tiles.
>Kevin_Bowerman: ADILNUV 1H VALUIN. +36 254
>Aabid_Ismail: IIU -IIU +0 228
#note Said "Exchange 2", almost hit clock, then took them back and thought for a minute or two. He quite clearly has a strong leave after this play, but often not a blank. Most likely, he has a lot of vowels on his rack, but with a blank in hand, he would most likely just drop AE, AI, OI or OE something similar at 11E, hoping to bingo on column N or row 3 or 5
>Kevin_Bowerman: DEELOOT 11E ODE +29 283
#note I didn't realize all that during the game, but luckily my best equity play still blocks the easiest lane and the best scoring spot. A TWOFER if you will. TOO(T)LE(R) is sick, and I would have played it if I had spotted/known it. Thought about plays there but didn't know it.
>Aabid_Ismail: ?AELMNT N9 oMENTAL +82 310
>Kevin_Bowerman: EIIJLOT 15L JI.L +57 340
#note Should probably keep an L for L(OWE) over the T? Not sure it really matters much.
>Aabid_Ismail: ABER K11 ABER +23 333
>Kevin_Bowerman: EIOOTTU J1 .OUIE +13 353
#note Didn't know UTI(S)#. Sadly I was unsure on T(EF)# as well, so I didn't play UTE(S). Luckily I would have to deal with this anymore, as I am going back to twl. This sims 2nd to UTI(S)#

>Aabid_Ismail: AADDEGI 6D EGAD +21 392
#note Only win for him.
>Kevin_Bowerman: EOTUV D6 .VOE +8 396
#note Spent forever looking for a win, and got down to about 30 seconds, so I played this, hoping for him to make a mistake. UTE(S) is best
>Aabid_Ismail: ADI 10G DI.A +14 406
#note I was really upset after this game, because I thought I had made the best play every turn and still lost. However, TWOFE(R) and GIMP were both fairly large mistakes. Still room for improvement, but I still think I got unlucky, losing a game where I played well to a non-expert player. Winnable, but very tough.
