#note Q prefers REJOIN over JOINER because it thinks I'm more likely to hit the column H scoring spot. On a tight board that could be the difference in the game.

>JD: ABELNSS M4 SLAB +23 276
#note BONNY looks better - I didn't spot it for some reason. AELSS bingos twice as often, although if I miss I may score less.

#note I only had two minutes to play, and under time pressure this was all I could think of that blocked the best two ZA plays and saved an out (ANGST). Afterward I realized that DOGAN or GONAD at E1 saving TAVS would be slightly better.
>Randy_Hersom: ABNZ C13 BA +20 371
#note Randy spent about 10 minutes on his endgame. Unfortunately for him, he thought that the CSW-only THON# might be good and that I was saving GNATS at C9. Furthermore, he thought he was up 16 and not 13, and he didn't see that my out on row 14 was worth more points. He put the winning play of ZA on the board at E1, then picked it up and switched to BA at C13, which he thought would win by 1 point!
>JD: AGNST 14K ANGST +15 354
#note Even GONAD would not have been enough to win (a 1-point loss), but ironically I think it's more likely that he would've found his winning play of AZO at 5B. I thought that he had missed ANGST as an out, but instead I profited from an unlikely word knowledge hole in Randy's game.
