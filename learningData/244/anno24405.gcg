#note AWA unnecessarily makes homeless bingos playable - AVOWAL is the play (I saw it but didn't like the lack of vowel in the leave)

#note SIZE at N1 takes away about half of the row 3 bingos. Will be challenging for him to beat me if he has the blank and can't bingo. This is a good time for a 6-ply sim, where the leave value of the blank is much lower in actuality because he may never get to play it for a bingo. Q has SIZE at 56% win versus 44% after OOZE on 6-ply. That makes this a substantial error.

#note given the pool, nothing lost if I fish with OP/UP, but I was too low on time to feel safe doing it and tried to take a sure win instead, scoring and also making bingos through the L harder if I mistracked. this is not a great play for spread! PEGBOX is sweet. At least I still win even if I draw the G or T. After fishing a P I'm 50% to draw an unblockable out-bingo (or maybe even INVEIGLER at 3B for 96)

#note not a great ending - could've lost if he had the blank and bingoed.
