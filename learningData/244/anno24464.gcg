>cesar: AEHIRTU 15K EH +20 246
#note at this point i started playing hyper-paranoidly, due to BORAXES and the other ridiculous occurrences this tournament (COSINES, HEKTARES, freaking WORKSITE), which doesnt make sense because there's still a weak lane on column N, and i think i may have actually played ELBOW and not annotated it correctly. H12 SHUT is the obvious play here. -13.5 but i don't care because i did this on purpose.

#note missing TURNERY and making a mockery out of Scrabble. no idea what i'm doing this game. none of this would have happened without EH. MY is also worth thinking about. -11

>cesar: AEEIRTT G2 TET +11 328
#note please just stop looking at this game while you can. it was an experiment in trying to learn to play defense while in the middle of the biggest tournament of the year. quackle likes doing dumb things like 14B ET or 14A TE though. really? ? -23
>alec_s: COP 14A COP +28 318
>cesar: AEGIORV 15C OVA +15 343
#note my chances of winning according to quackle seem to be much lower than i think (about ~63%) but i actually don't know how quackle calculates win % with sims. is it just the % of sims that have me ahead after two plies, or does it use the bogowin table always? overate looks better. he doesn't have much flexibility to hit the lane at 15 even with the blank. but no i'm not doing that with the blank unseen. -7
