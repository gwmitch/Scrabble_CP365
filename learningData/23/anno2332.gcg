>Jason: DEINRTY M7 Y.D +13 24
#note Why did I not think TINDERY was good? Gah!
>Brian_Bowman: AEEMNOR O1 ENAMORE. +92 187
>Jason: DEINRRT -DR +0 24
#note "I am nothing if not stubborn," I said as I put the tiles down.
>Brian_Bowman: AOZ N2 AZO +43 230
>Jason: EIKNRTT F5 KNITTER +77 101
#note OK, let the "comeback" begin... Counted it as 75.
>Brian_Bowman: INUW J4 UNWI. +16 246
#note Held, in part because when UNW went down, I thought the E was next, momentarily forgetting this possibility.
>Jason: AACIIOT K2 IOTA +14 115
>Brian_Bowman: AUW 5C WAU. +22 268
>Jason: ACEHIIR E10 HAIR +27 142
#note RACHE(T)'s leave is crap, but it scores and opens more.
>Brian_Bowman: SV 12D V.S +24 292
>Jason: CDEIILT D1 CILI.TED +82 224
#note Nearly missed this. Fortunate it stayed open.
>Brian_Bowman: NORY 1D .ORNY +30 322
#note Matt Graham played John Viloria next to us; John's board was one of those from the '04 Nationals, the square ones with wooden edges. One was coming off, and Matt got so annoyed with it, he took it off, and, with force, put it on the table, startling both of us. He apologized, although it wasn't on my time so what did I care? :)
>Jason: BEEGRSX J1 EX +50 274
#note I've cut the deficit from 206 to what I think is 50 here ... unfortunately, that'd be as close as I'd get.
>Brian_Bowman: GISV 14B VIGS +24 346
#note "It's almost like he wants the board closed!" I said.
>Jason: ABEEGRS 8A ABE. +21 295
#note I correctly passed on (R)EBARGES*.
>Brian_Bowman: ?AELNPS A6 AN.bLEPS +62 408
#note Although, maybe he'd kept it on because he would've had SPAN(S)uLE as a trip-trip, the kind of stupid word Brian would know. :)
>Jason: BEEGRST L3 REB +23 318
#note In hindsight, definitely B(E)G at C7, which I considered.
>Brian_Bowman: FM C7 F.M +24 432
#note John asked Matt before the game if he could eat his breakfast while they played and Matt agreed. As John laid down yet another bingo, Matt said: "Sure, you can eat your breakfast as you mercilessly kick my ass!" with emphasis on the last four words. The three of us laughed and then Matt said "I'm 85% kidding on that." I don't think John laughed as much at that one, although Brian and I found it funny. Matt's so funny he should do stand-up! Oh wait...
>Jason: ADEGQST C13 Q. +22 340
#note Maybe I can hit the E for (R)ESTAGED. Maybe QATS at 10J to limit the deficit.
>Brian_Bowman: JNO 2B JO.N +24 456
#note Stefan and David entered the day as the only 9-2s. After Stefan lost, with Jesse playing Koenig at table 1, Stefan stood behind Dave and held up a handmade "Go Jesse!" sign, which made me laugh and grab Brian when we walked by saying "Did you see what Stefan did?" After the last game, when Stefan beat Jesse but not by enough to overtake him, Stefan showed him the sign. "Be careful what you wish for," Frank said. "Yeah," Stefan said. "Jesse, you went too far!" 
>Jason: ADEGGST 12D ...A +7 347
#note Fishing for the A for GADGETS/STAGGED.
>Brian_Bowman: ACEEILO 13G ILEAC +12 468
#note Since I don't have the bingo, Q likes it at 3C.
>Jason: DEGGOST H12 S.OG +27 374
#note Missed S(L)OGGED for 18 more in the spot where I(L)EAC could've gone.
>Brian_Bowman: EO L7 O.E +11 479
#note Brian was so nice, saying: "I really didn't want to do that to you at this stage of this tournament." The tiles didn't go my way, but who knows how different it would've been if I hadn't chickened out on TINDERY?
>Brian_Bowman:  (DEGT) +12 491
