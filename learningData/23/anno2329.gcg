#note right spot, but WAIT is better at the same spot just because it doesn't set up that lane. with a bad rack, you don't want to enhance volatility...

#note I guess this is the worst-case scenario here, but WAIT would've avoided it.

#note I could play HAW here to block up the bottom-right, and I considered it, but it really doesn't help me much with winning this game, and the sim sort of reflects it.

>Magrathean: AGGNTTU N8 GUTT.. +9 233
#note a really frustrating move that I must've spent five or six minutes on. unfortunately, there really wasn't very much good to do here. Quackle suggests GUT or TUG at 11I, which seem a bit defeatist. I chose GUTTAE because it opens things up, and a parallel play on column O creates a very nice new lane. interestingly, quackle seems to say that guttae is less volatile of a move relative to GUT or TUG, maybe because the board wouldn't necessarily have much to offer to him without the new spot I'm offering.

#note I should've recognized that PEAN was significantly better than GANEF. It leaves lanes at completely different quadrants of the boards that are tricky to block. It even scores more. evan's response illustrates why this is such a bad move.
>Evan_Berofsky: CILV 2F CL.VI +18 361
#note I basically hurried the end of the game by playing GANEF when I didn't need to, without giving myself particularly good lanes anyway.

#note quackle preliminary indicates a few wins, but after looking through some endgames it appears that quackle is simply neglecting to block in the preendgame player. that's not to say that my play is right, but I was at least trying for something - drawing an S or both blanks would give me SLURRIER, which happens not to be good but which I felt was worth a try. But playing the H at M3 offers an actual try, drawing for SURLIER, which should still never work. Another try is LEU at O12 and hope that evan doesn't realize that D hook bingos are dangerous. my play is not terrible from a spread perspective, and could've won me the game with a different draw and a slightly more liberal dictionary.
