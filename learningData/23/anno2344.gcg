>Phil: AADEENV 8D DEAVE +22 22
#note Essentially tied with VEENA.
>Phil_Polsky: ACDHTW E3 WATCH.D +32 32
>Phil: ?AFINNO 7H FONtINA +66 88
#note Chickened out on FANIONS...don't know FAVONIAN.

>Phil: CEELOTX 9H EX +23 144
#note I don't like Q's choice of EXEC 4L. Missed COXAE 4B which I like best, chickened out on DETOX D8... not a great play -8 evaluation.
>Phil_Polsky: ITZ 10F ZIT +39 165
>Phil: CEGLOOT D1 COOL +27 171
#note I knew Quackle would prefer COOT- I hate the L though.
>Phil_Polsky: DEOS 1D .ODES +24 189
>Phil: EGINRRT L7 ..TERRING +74 245
>Phil_Polsky: IMP 15L .IMP +27 216
>Phil: ADEILUY C3 YAUD +37 282
#note I considered YAULD but I didn't think EI was 6 points better than EIL. Especially considering I'm going up a bingo after this play- it's not like those extra 6 are so vital.
>Phil_Polsky: AFO 11E OAF +28 244
>Phil: EHILLSU N11 HILU. +20 302
#note I had the right idea, but didn't see HELIUM.
>Phil_Polsky: AJSY 12C JAYS +45 289
>Phil: ?BEILPS C12 .IB +24 326
#note This play took me forever...apparently JIBE is best? How it's 13 evaluation points higher is seriously mindboggling.
>Phil_Polsky: ABN B13 BAN +22 311
>Phil: ?ELOPST A12 POLE +43 369
#note I didn't want to bingo unless it was for a lot of points (passed up on TOPPLES 2G). Too bad I missed PISTOLE, KLEPTOS and TUPELOS on the A line. 
>Phil_Polsky: IQ K13 QI +24 335
>Phil: ?ELRSTT 2G LoTTERS +61 430
#note LATS D11 might be really sexy, but I don't agree with not bingoing here. After LOTTERS, bingos only really play from B5...not very likely.
>Phil_Polsky: AAV 1M AVA +20 355
>Phil: EEGGOS 4L EGG +14 444
#note Missed the sweet EGOISM O3.
>Phil_Polsky: NRUW 10J WR.N +15 370
>Phil: EOS O10 OES +12 456
#note Forgot that YAUD took the S.
