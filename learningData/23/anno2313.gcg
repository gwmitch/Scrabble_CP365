>sr: AADDIIT --  -14 0
>k8: FNOORTU 8G UNROOF +26 26
#note SR: I guess I confused AGITA and ADYTA here.
>sr: AADDIIT 9E DITA +11 11
#note SR: OIDIA K8 12 would have been much better here.
>k8: ABENOTY 10H BAYONET +77 103
>sr: ABDGIIM 8A IAMBI +39 50
>k8: ?ACEIMR N8 MA.RICEs +72 175
#note SR:  AEROnOMIC K5 98 is awesome. I think the row 11 words--ChIMERA 11D, ClAIMER 11C, etc.--are better here.
>sr: ADDEGIT O4 GAITED +45 95
>k8: EEHIPSW 15L WI.H +39 214
#note Q prefers underlaps of HEW or SHEW in the 11 row. I prefer to take out the triple lane.
>sr: DEOOTVY 11I TOY +29 124
#note SR: TOYO 11I looks best...amazing how I can play TOY and miss TOYO.
>k8: AEEKPRS 7A SPEAKER +92 306
#note SR: Great fit, and the only bingo!
>sr: DENOOTV 12L VO.D +20 144
#note SR: And after I picked my tiles, I noticed that she even blocked my bingo.
>k8: EGLNOSU 12D LOUNGE +21 327
#note K8: takes out a lane... trying not to be stupid/greedy.  Not so friendly a fishing rack that I was overly tempted.
>sr: EEILNOT I1 ENTOILE. +60 204
#note SR: Desparation phony.
>k8: AFLQRSX 1H R.LAX +60 387
>sr: EEGOSUW 13C WOE +16 220
#note SR: Quackle's only play with ANY win% is WEES 10B, clocking in at 0.01%. This wasn't too bad, I think, though I could have played it for an extra point at 7K.
>k8: EEFJQSU 5H F.QUE +34 421
#note K8: blocks a bit, leaves me trying to draw for the -ERS.
>sr: ?EGIRSU 3D tURGI.ES +60 280
#note SR: Actually the only bingo in EGIRSTU?, believe it or not. Is RELAXERS 1H better? It has higher equity, but this has a higher win%.
>k8: DEHJRSV 1H .....ERS +45 466
#note K8: SHRE(WIsH) for 48!  Glad for my lead at this point, since my rack is looking pretty messy.
>sr: ACINNST 6I .INT +23 303
#note SR: I didn't know STANNIC 14E, meaning 'pertaining to tin.' Sn is the chemical symbol for tin, as the Latin 'stannum' means tin. STANNUM is also good in our dictionary, meaning 'tin.' Anyway, LINN 6I sims better here, and so do CANST 10B and STANNIC. STANNIC could be a little risky because of the potential to get Z or V-stuck (the J would play at E11 and K7 after STANNIC).
>k8: ADHJLVZ E11 Z..AL +28 494
#note SR: ZA N5 is best here by a little.
>sr: ACNPS 4L N +6 309
>k8: DHJV D6 J.. +12 506
>sr: ACPS 15D C.ASP +36 345
#note SR: I went over on time here by a minute, so the final is 506-355. I hadn't even noticed I was low, I guess I wasn't really paying attention. Not too big of a deal.
>sr:  (DHV) +20 365
#note K8: this was one of my better games as far as equity loss per turn goes, but that doesn't factor in mistracking and accepting a phony bingo (even if I was pretty sure it was phony).  I think Sam is better than me.
