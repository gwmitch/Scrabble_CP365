>Scott_Appel: AAINPRS 8D PARIANS +74 74
#note Looked like he was going to play PIRANAS before seeing the vowel placement. Scott had just come off an endgame win against KFC that sounded genius ... Kate made a pre-endgame play and picked it up. Scott thought "why wouldn't she like that play?" and realized the E must be in the bag; fortunately for him since he needed the E. She made a one-tile play, he fished for the E, got it, and ended up winning. I'm sure Kate could provide more details ... if she's recovered. :)
>Jason: DEIQRUY D8 .IQUED +36 36
#note So much for him passing and opening with QUERY... :)
>Scott_Appel: AAFIOTT 7H FIAT +18 92
#note Scott says he should've played it at C12. He also considered OAF in that spot (Speedy's second choice), he said after the game, but was concerned about the -S hook.
>Jason: ABNNORY 6J BARNY +37 73
#note Another bingo miss, although I defy you to show me the human that would've seen the nine. I was just relieved to have a decent play, something I didn't see before FIAT.
>Scott_Appel: AGLOOST 5F GALOOT +26 118
#note Scott was disappointed he didn't play LOGO at 5I here; same number of points and a better leave. Too bad I couldn't pay tribute to Estelle Getty and make the BOTCHA- front extension. lol (P.S. The nine last turn was NONB(IN)ARY.)
>Jason: AIMNOOO C11 MOO +22 95
>Scott_Appel: BDEIPST E8 .DIT +34 152
>Jason: ADEEINO H1 IDEA. +21 116
#note This took me longer to see than it should've.
>Scott_Appel: BEEIKPS G1 KEP +28 180
>Jason: EGHNOSZ 2F Z.. +33 149
#note Ah, for an A ... with only three left, though, it's not worth fishing for.
>Scott_Appel: BEEIIRS 2B RESI... +34 214
#note BREE(ZED) keeps the S. Four more and Q says IIS is superior to BEI.
>Jason: EGHNORS 1A NOH +25 174
#note Another bingo miss. I should probably know GORHENS.
>Scott_Appel: ABDEILN 3A BANI +29 243
>Jason: EGJORSU 6E JOG +21 195
>Scott_Appel: CDEHLVW N2 CHEV. +32 275
>Jason: AEORSSU B5 AROUSES +67 262
#note It took me a couple turns before I realized the significance of this play, although it explained why Scott chuckled when I put it down.
>Scott_Appel: ?DELOUW M3 OW +25 300
#note Four out of the past five turns Scott's made Speedy's choice.
>Jason: EEGILTV H7 ..VE +10 272
#note I spent a long time with this rack. I felt like I had to open before it was too late and I was torn between this or the really daring (IN)VITE, or maybe (IN)VITEE. Championship player puts neither on its list, liking (IN)VEIGLE, which I don't think I knew. VET at 14A is next, which surprises me. I mean, Scott plays through the V for 18 minimum and then what?
>Scott_Appel: ?DELRUX A8 XU +56 356
#note ...well, if I knew he had that, I'd have played (IN)VITE. Very seldom would making the best bingo be a 23-point equity loss, but that's how far ahead of R(E)fLUXED this is.
>Jason: EGILLTY C5 GEY +25 297
#note OK, now we've entered "how the heck am I possibly winning this game?" time. Gotta turn over, hope to hit a blank, but need to score too so he can't outrun the bingo. This does the job, but I need to find the best play and then a better one. LEY is two less, but the GILT leave's far better, esp. with two N's out.
>Scott_Appel: ?DELMNR 10G M.LD +11 367
#note Can he possibly have neither blank?
>Jason: CEFILLT L1 LIFE +37 334
#note The only play. Can I possibly outrun?
>Scott_Appel: ??AENRU M6 .EURoNAl +66 433
#note Not a guaranteed win, surprisingly. A quick search says why, though; I could have TREENAIL, TREELAWN, LITERATE, etc. through the A. (N)EURAxoN is, though. I like a play like (Z)A, another guaranteed win. Given the unseen pool, I can't score, I have to open ... you're almost guaranteed a bingo out as I try in vain for a blank.
>Jason: CEILTTW 8L C.LT +27 361
#note WITE or WILE at L10 is nine better, making him find R(OD)ENT to go out. WITE threatens this if he doesn't.
>Scott_Appel: ENRT L12 TERN +15 448
#note Second game in a row this was his out play. Meanwhile, why was I leaving such good tiles in the bag? :) A pleasure to play Scott, and his compliment of my play afterward (you hear that, Robin?) was a nice ego boost. Scott may not have been totally pleased with his play in this tournament or this game, but it looked very solid before and after I knew his racks.
