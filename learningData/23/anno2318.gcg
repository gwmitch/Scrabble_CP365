>Jason: AADIIIO 8D OIDIA +14 14
#note When I'd looked at ADIII, I really hoped for an O to clean this mess up. Naturally, I picked what Q says is the wrong placement.
>Cecilia_Le: IY F6 YI. +15 15
>Jason: AIOOPQS 9C QI +23 37
>Cecilia_Le: LNO 7E L.ON +12 27
>Jason: AMOOPST 9H POM +13 50
#note Missed PO(LI)S at E5. Adding the O to make POMO is Speedy's second choice.
>Cecilia_Le: ADEGR 10F GRADE +28 55
#note It looks like we added 27 and 28 and got 53. Oops.
>Jason: ?ANOSTV -OV +0 50
#note At least I didn't miss a bingo, but I probably should've played NOVA at 11J, which I considered.
>Cecilia_Le: AEW 11I AWE +24 79
>Jason: ?AEJNST K3 fANJETS +84 134
#note Fished into ANST? and pulled a J, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the E to bingo. Didn't know JEsSANT at L8 for 99.
>Cecilia_Le: AETZ J2 ZETA +38 117
#note Cecilia said I blocked AGATIZE when I played fANJETS ... don't know if the blank was involved.
>Jason: AMOPRTT L1 MATT +26 160
#note Close. MOTT in the same spot. (Find your best play and find a better one!)
>Cecilia_Le: AAFV 12K FAVA +25 142
>Jason: EEOPRUU 8K .ROUP +24 184
#note This is no good?! Seriously?! Wow, I was sure. (Q)UEUE is 20-some points better equity-wise; maybe I got obsessed with blocking the -S hook. Plus, after (Q)UEUE, I have a hook tile at the ready if she whacks me with an S play along column O.
>Cecilia_Le: OX M12 .OX +26 168
>Jason: EEEILOU 14K LU.E +22 206
#note Again, too fixated on blocking the hot spot. Should've played (M)OUE or (M)EOU; but I feel OK drawing into four vowels given the 14-30-1 ratio of the unseen pool.
>Cecilia_Le: EEEEE -EEEEE +0 168
>Jason: EEFILLO 15H FILO +23 229
>Cecilia_Le: CHI 10A CHI +27 195
>Jason: EELORTU A10 .OLTER +27 256
#note Right idea, but COULEE, CROUTE, COUTER and COLURE are better. Of course, when you draw RINSE as I would, you'll usually be OK.
>Cecilia_Le: DEEN 1K E.END +24 219
>Jason: EEINRSU O4 RESU.INE +61 317
>Cecilia_Le: EEII -EEII +0 219
>Jason: BCEINTW 13A .WICE +20 337
#note Fortunate to be able to kill the bottom of the board.
>Cecilia_Le: DKORU D11 DU.K +22 241
#note Played DROUK at 14E before realizing it made UF*.
>Jason: BGGNSTY 15C BY +30 367
>Cecilia_Le: BER 3G BER... +11 252
#note I told Cecilia after the game I thought this was a good play, but she didn't agree. Empties the bag, but it looks to be the only way to open.
>Jason: GGINRST 4E GRIT +13 380
>Cecilia_Le: ?AHNOSV O13 ASH +30 282
>Jason: GNS M7 N.GS +8 388
#note "Gosh, your racks must've been awful!" I said after the game. "Yeah ... they weren't good," Cecilia said. Somehow, 2-1 against Cecilia and 3-2 in the tournament.
