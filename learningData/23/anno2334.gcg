>Joe_Edley: EIPRV 8D VIPER +28 28
>Jason: ACIKMPQ 7G PACK +27 27
#note We started very early; I noticed somebody obviously watching our game but didn't think much of it. Assumed it must be a lower-rated player wanting to see Joe Edley assert his greatness against some schmo.
>Joe_Edley: ?ADEIRU K5 REsIDUA +90 118
#note Not even a "thank you." :)
>Jason: AIMNOQR 10H MAQ.I +36 63
#note Q(U)OIN's Speedy's choice, but it's too daring for me. It also puts Q(U)INOA and Q(U)A ahead of this.
>Joe_Edley: ?EEEFTT 5F FETTE.Ed +60 178
#note The mysterious woman left the table shortly after this (perhaps recognizing a lost cause when she saw one). Joe said "I nearly missed this ... that would've been embarrassing with her watching." Yeah, 'cause I'm sure she found the bingo is EEEFTT?. How can you not bingo with that? :) A slight mistake from Joe: FETTErE(R) and EnFETTE(R) score 10 more.
>Jason: ENOORVY 8K .VORY +45 108
#note No open C. Curses.
>Joe_Edley: EILORT 12H TOILER +22 200
#note The woman re-appeared (our tablemates hadn't sat down yet); Joe turned to her and asked: "Are you a writer?" She was, with the New Yorker. "I got that sense from you," he said. (I later learned she was watching Sal Piro play Frank and talked to both of them.) "Do you know who I am?" he asked. She said she did, pointed at Ira and said she knew who he was, but looked at me and said "But I don't know who you are." I replied: "And you'd have no reason to!" (Maybe if I'd just introduced myself, I'd have made it in the New Yorker. Alas.)
>Jason: AEHNOOR 13G OOH +22 130
#note Joe then commented that if she looked at the standings, his name wouldn't be very high. (He started 1-6, -666 and Sherrie's commentary said he drew three blanks and eight S's through eight games. Yikes!) I chimed in: "Yes, could you put in your story that right now I'm ahead of him in the standings?"
>Joe_Edley: EFH 9E FEH +34 234
#note I later found out that she talked to Sal and Frank for a while. "Did you mention me?" I asked Frank. "It's not all about you!" he said. It's not?!?! How disconcerting...
>Jason: AEGILNR O8 .EARLING +89 219
#note Nearly missed this. THAT would've been embarrassing. I've overcome the first wave, but the second wave would do me in.
>Joe_Edley: ABCW N7 C.AB +26 260
#note Played B(R)AW/AE/WA* before seeing his mistake.
>Jason: AILNOSU H1 UNLI. +18 237
#note First mistake. UN(FETTEREd) for 24 is the star play.
>Joe_Edley: ENTW 4L WENT +27 287
>Jason: AAAEIOS -AAAIO +0 237
#note Yeah, this was a "you're not winning this game" draw.
>Joe_Edley: UX N13 XU +31 318
>Jason: AEIJNSS O1 JES. +33 270
#note The writer came back and stood behind me. Just for her, I set up _ASENJIS and JAS_INES. (Hey, how many chances am I gonna get?) I think I've got to be ballsy and play JINS at 10B, even with three D's out. (As it turns out, that would've given him GELADAS for 93.)
>Joe_Edley: AADEGLS 2B SELADA.G +78 396
#note Apparently the writer also saw part of Robin's game and asked how she did afterward. When she heard Robin lost, she said "But I saw you play all your tiles once for the bonus!" to which Robin said: "Yeah, all that did was get me within 150! He had three!"
>Jason: AAINNSW 3K NAW +28 298
>Joe_Edley: ENOZ 1A ZONE +49 445
#note A "Raftery" play. The dagger!
>Jason: AINORSU 14I OUR +11 309
>Joe_Edley: DIIMOS 14B IDIOMS +32 477
>Jason: ABDINSY 13C ABY +31 340
#note D(A)Y or D(A)B at E1 is six better.
>Joe_Edley: GOTT 15B TOG +20 497
>Jason: DINS 10B DINS +15 355
#note "You should've gotten me yesterday; everybody beat up on me yesterday," Joe said. Indeed, Frank termed it "beat up on Joe day." Cool to lose 24.1 equity points against a legend and be complimented afterward. Like I said, one of the top 10 games of my career.
>Jason:  (T) +2 357
