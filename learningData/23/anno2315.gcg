#note aviate [-4]
>Tim: ATX 9E TAX +39 39
#note i shoulda seen aviate
>Cesar: AAEHOOS 7H OOH +9 33
#note i saw 10F OE and just didn't realize how strong it was. the next obvious choice is 7H HAO. call it a sixth sense but i talked myself out of it with a J unseen. OOH though is much weaker than OE. AAHOS is not a worse leave than AAES, and the board is also better for me after OE. however, i do like playing open. [-12]
>Tim: J F8 ..J +26 65
#note he had the J!
>Cesar: AAAEIRS 6J AA +11 44
#note AHA is better. it's not terribly obvious to me, but maybe because i'm down i want a better bingo lane. [-5]
>Tim: ?IILMTU L6 LIThIUM +71 136
#note nice.. now i'm in trouble
>Cesar: AEEIORS 8L .OEA +12 56
#note 8J IOTA sims better. am i going to find the top play already? [-2]
>Tim: ENW K11 NEW +20 156
>Cesar: EGIRSTZ 6F ZIT +35 91
#note didn't think i could get away with GRAZIEST*. K5 ZA sims slightly better. [-1]
>Tim: DFKNNQR O7 D.RN +5 161
#note lower rated players tend to make plays like this. always keep up the pressure. in his defense, it's also possible he could have kept a monster leave, though, and there's something to be said for blocking the most dangerous lane.
>Cesar: EEGOPRS J9 PEG +12 103
#note i agonized over this move for a while. i wanted to play J11 GROPE, the highest scoring move (which also keeps a nice leave!) but this is a good example when the move is blatantly wrong. if he goes to the right after GROPE i'm going to have a pleasant time trying to open the board. N6 GEE sims best. PEG was kind of desperate, the P is good for me to keep with this leave. i'm also screwed if he goes NEWS/ something to the right.[-6]
>Tim: BEFKNPQ J5 N.. +6 167
>Cesar: EEIORRS O7 ....ER +8 111
#note just frustrated here. I9 OR keeps a better leave and scores more than DARNER. i was kind of hoping for a challenge. [-3]
>Tim: EV N6 VE. +17 184
>Cesar: CEEIORS 10F .EE +20 131
#note here i make another bonehead move. i realize that i'm going to need to catch up with scoring so i should stop fishing ... but i didn't see M7 COO!! [-6.5]
>Tim: DEHIRSY G8 ...D +12 196
>Cesar: CILOORS F4 CO. +14 145
#note so frustrated but it's my fault for giving up the Es. COO is the right play again. [-7.5] i'm 0 for 9 now on making the top play. i wanted to open up another lane, but this is kind of desperate for that purpose.
>Tim: EHIRSSY -IEHRS +0 196
>Cesar: GILOPRS 5D GL.P +18 163
#note the top simming play! woohoo!
>Tim: LU D3 LU. +8 204
>Cesar: FIIORSU -FIIU +0 163
#note i saw N10 IF but i was so frustrated at this point! is that even right? i also thought of N11 FOUR. [-9]
>Tim: EY 11N Y. +5 209
>Cesar: DFIORRS I3 FRO +12 175
#note terrible. F. [-13] (hint see M7 spot again)

>Tim: DEEH 15F HEED +40 316
>Cesar: AFOQRTY 1G OFAY +33 285
#note 3C FLY might be better, but then again, i didn't wrte down my exact rack for this move :( i'm fairly certain i had the Q, cuz i remember wanting to dump it and realizing it i needed it to score, as crazy as that sounds.
>Tim: BLSU 3I .LUBS +20 336
>Cesar: IMOOQRT 13F ROOM +32 317
#note [-0.7]% 4K MOO and B1 QUOIT apparently give me a little better chance of winning. at this point i was just hoping i could outscore him, but i still needed a lot of luck.
