#note 9H sCOOPER 71 scores 2 more points but I wasn't 100% sure it was good.

>Ross_B.: AEFGRTU --  -86 125
#note I thought it might be good (it looked semi-familiar) but I also knew he plays phoneys.  I took a chance and it paid off.
>Brad_W.: CEEINOO K5 .ENECIO +18 269
#note 15A O(T)IC 27 looks like the best.  Knowing his rack and getting a free turn, I decided to play off a bunch of tiles and try to draw an S or blank.
>Ross_B.: EFGRU 8J R.FUGE +42 167
>Brad_W.: ILORUUY 6B ROILY +37 306
#note 6C OILY 34 looks better.  Better to keep the R with the two vowels.
>Ross_B.: AMRZ 10J Z.RAM +42 209
>Brad_W.: AAINSUU A14 NU +14 320
#note I decided to take out the obvious hotspot, although I'm not sure how dangerous it actually was.
>Ross_B.: NTT 11A ..T.NT +36 245
#note Pretty good when you can score 36 points with NTT.
>Brad_W.: AADISUY J4 D.Y +28 348
#note I knew I was asking for trouble here, but he was scoring chunks of points and I felt like I needed to maintain my lead.  O5 ADI(E)US 24 is a cool play because it takes out both hotspots at once.  I did pick the only scoring play that didn't burn the S.

#note After the game, I looked at this play as the one that lost.  I had just drawn the blank and, being up 61, felt that this guaranteed the win.  So I stopped trying to make the best play and decided to fish off my three clunkiest tiles for few points.  I missed a couple of bingos I didn't know.  I like O7 P(E)DS because it takes out both hotspots.  The only way he wins is if he gets a bingo, so blocking the obvious bingo lanes should have been a priority.
>Ross_B.: AGIILNT N1 LIGATIN. +74 351
>Brad_W.: ?ADRSUV O1 AD +18 379
#note I couldn't figure out what to do here.  I wanted to dump some of my clunky tiles somewhere for points, but I didn't want to leave the TWS open for him.
>Ross_B.: OW O4 WO +20 371
>Brad_W.: ?EIRSUV 3L VU. +14 393
#note 12G VIRUSEs 83 is an embarrassing miss.  To be honest, I didn't know what SENECIO meant and I was paranoid that it didn't take an S.  O10 S(P)IV 27 looks like the best non-bingo play.  It scores, it leaves 1 in the bag, and blocks a major hotspot for the Q.  I didn't see the play or the hotspot for the Q.
>Ross_B.: EIQU O11 .IQUE +51 422
#note Oops.
>Brad_W.: ?EHIMRS 3F SHE +27 420
#note This game is still winnable but I don't have a lot of time.  Actually, I had 2 or 3 minutes but I couldn't solve it.  My instinct was to play L1 HI(V)E 28, but I didn't see any possibilities with the MRS? leave.  Finally I had to make a play as my clock wound down.  Turns out my instinct was right.  HIVE is the play because it gives me 1H M(A)RSH 27 to go out.  I wish I had seen it.
