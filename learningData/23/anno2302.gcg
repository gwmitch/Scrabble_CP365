>Magrathean: CDFRSTT -DFT +0 0
#note as usual, the wrong exchange. sure, the C is nice, but keeping RST is just more useful. The C is better as an addition to an already good rack than as a starting point.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EELOOQT -EELOO +0 0
>Magrathean: ACDMRSW 8G WARM +18 18
#note yuck. I seem to have a blind spot for finding CWM as an opening play, since the same thing happened at nationals.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: EHNW 7J HEWN +18 18
>Magrathean: CDELNSU K4 DUC. +14 32
#note oh no! I talked myself out of UNSCALED. It sounded silly. how unfortunate.

>Magrathean: EIIINSU 4K .UI +8 123
#note all of a sudden, keeping the second I is a huge liability, which makes sense - the T was the best spot for that rack to hit, the bingo percentages are actually higher with EINS by a good 15%, and if you miss again EIINS is a terrible place to be.

#note i'm not sure why this is any worse than FOX. NEXT is about even with both of these.

>Magrathean: ?EJLPRT J10 JE.P +29 383
#note unclear that it matters very much what I play, but JET and JEEP both have big counters and JET at C9 doesn't, which means that I should probably play the latter.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: AEFQSUY H12 .FAY +30 310
>Magrathean: ?AEILRT N2 RETIA +33 416
#note what a cute move! the best two plays are both supertricky - NEcTARIAL as a disconnected 9 and TAILSKID! My play should still seal the win.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: DQSU 14F QU.DS +53 363
>Magrathean: ?AEELLO O1 LEE +17 433
#note very low on time indeed when I made this play, but it works out to be two points worse than the cute ANODE at I11.
>Joe_Bihlmeyer: BBOU 11J .BB +14 377
#note it's actually a point better for Joe to block my out by dropping the O at 13I.
>Magrathean: ?ALO 13J .OLAr +12 445
#note in turn, I should drop the O at 13I, then play DAhL/NA/LIROTh/EL to go out. adorable. but I'll take the win.
