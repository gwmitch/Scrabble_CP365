#note surprised this sims highest. i was kind of frustrated and really wanted to play MAYO/ON or 10G EON (which is second best). i think EON is the best play if you assume opp kept a great leave, which he probably did with BY.

#note it likes B12 GUV [-5]. this move probably merits some discussion. i passed it up because i was likely to bingo next turn anyway, and didn't want to give him easy points by possibly hooking it, but leaving the H open gives him EASIER points, so it's definitely right to play GUV there.
