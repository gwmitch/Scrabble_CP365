#note Phony.  I didn't think it was good, but I also knew it was probably too plausible to be challenged.

#note CLaQUER A9 is best, my play is pretty bad for dumping the U with the Q still on my rack.  My reasoning was that I will always have two spots to play QI next turn.

#note ENDEMIAl 4H is 96 points!  I know the word but I didn't even look in that spot.  I was so excited after seeing AcETAMIDE that I played it right away.  I had learned it after looking up ACETAMID in Zyzzyva and seeing the E hook.

#note Sims best, although plays like GREEDIER and SRI G3 are interesting options.

#note IRRUPTS 14H is better, but I don't know the word.  It took me a while to find this.

#note GREEDSOME is awesome.  Quackle's static evaluator doesn't like my play, but I like it because it leaves GOLEM B2 next turn.
