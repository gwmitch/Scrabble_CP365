#note In this felicitous game, Ross comes from behind to beat a much better player who gets both blanks and all four S's.

#note Bradley's a fabulous player without all of this tile support.  Ye gods!
>Ross_Brown: AEFGRTU 11F TURFAGE +86 211
#note Desperate.  I don't believe I have ever sailed a phony past Bradley, nor has he ever tried to play one against me.

>Bradley_Whitmarsh: CEEINO K5 .ENECIO +18 269
>Ross_Brown: AEFGRTU 8J R.FUGE +42 167
#note Not sure what he was thinking here, since he knew what tiles I was holding.

>Ross_Brown: EGINQTT 11A ..T.NT +36 245
#note I thought this was pretty clever.  Still a couple of N's left unseen to make an -ING or -IN(G) play.

#note Bradley held this one - not sure why.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AD O1 AD +18 379
>Ross_Brown: BIOQUWW O4 WO +20 371
#note I could have fobbed off the Q for nothing, but leaving two W's?  Better to hope for some -QU- magic.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: UV 3L VU. +14 393
>Ross_Brown: BEINQUW O11 .IQUE +51 422
#note Yeah, something like that!  There are two unseen A's that could give me the WAB play I need to win.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: EHS 3F SHE +27 420
#note Even with a final S and blank, Bradley is nearly sunk.  He can't play into the open, because I have BWANA and NAWAB as out plays.
>Ross_Brown: AABNW C2 WAB +24 446
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?IMR 12H MIRs +17 437
>Bradley_Whitmarsh:  (AN) +4 441
#note Bradley also lost 10 points for going over on his clock.  This was the only game he lost in Early Bird #2, as he persevered to win first prize.
