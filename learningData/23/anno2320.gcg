>Jason: JLPQTTX -JLPQT +0 0
#note The first three I looked at were JQX and I had to chuckle. Speedy likes just keeping the X ... odd. Although in situations likes these, Speedy and Championship Player often differ.

>Jason: ADINRTU K5 AID +22 51
#note One of those racks I never seem to handle well, where every play seems like it's either breaking up a great combo or scoring too little/is too fishy into a rack with no E, S or blank and risky. Not a bad play, though.

#note Can't complain about that post-bingo draw. 64 in five turns, then 78 and 63. Gotta love this game.
>Aaron_Bader: BELRV 13J VERB.L +22 180
>Jason: DEGGIVZ 1E .IGGED +33 238
#note Missed ZIGG(E)D at K9. Too focused on killing the P spot or the O column spot.

#note I <3 the VZ combo! :)
>Aaron_Bader: CDO 2A COD +23 237
>Jason: AENNSVZ N1 VENA +25 289
#note OK, I guess I'll break it up now, esp. since both blanks are out and I best be turning over fast.
>Aaron_Bader: ?EEILRT 10A RETILEs +73 310
>Jason: AENNRSZ D8 ZA.RE +48 337
#note Gah! Missed (R)AZERS for 75! At least it was my only mistake of the game, though.  And grrr... How much better has my turnover been than his? And I still can't catch a blank, when I'll probably need one to win.
>Aaron_Bader: AABI 8A BAI.A +48 358
>Jason: EINNSTY K12 Y.N +6 343
#note I was proud of this play and glad Championship Player agreed. He can't block both spots, and there's a very good chance I can hit through the E on row 12/on row 13, or have flexibility along row 15, whichever he blocks. But he can't kill both and I'm drawing into a dynamic leave.
>Aaron_Bader: ?EKORUW 15G WORKs +39 397
#note Since EYEN doesn't take the S, Championship Player likes KUE at 11I, followed by a bunch of row 11 plays like WOKE. Giving me the S, sim likes WOKE to win about 88% of the time, WORKs about 72%. Can't fault the play here, though. As you can see, the bag was quite good to me.
>Jason: AEILNST 13A ELASTIN +81 424
#note Yeah, picking AL from a bag of ACLNU was about as good as I could do. We found three wins: CU gives me NEUSTIC and AC gives me CIN(E)ASTE, plus this. Thanks, Tile Gods. 5-2 and flying high at lunch.
