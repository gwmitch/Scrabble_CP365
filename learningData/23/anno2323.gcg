>Jason: CEEFIIN 8E FICE +18 18
>Seth_Lipkin: HIMORST I5 RIMSHOT +79 79
#note Ba-dum-bum! (Where's the high hat?) Grateful I didn't play FICE with the I on the star, or it's 108.
>Jason: EEINRTV F6 RE.NVITE +71 89
#note Gah! INVE(R)TER as a double-double for 94 is good! Didn't trust it.
>Seth_Lipkin: ?AEOQRS 12A QuAES.OR +104 183
#note I wondered why Seth took any time at all to make this play; now I see EQuA(T)ORS/(RIMSHOT)S is seven less and doesn't slot the Q in the triple. Championship player gives this the edge, though.
>Jason: LMOTTUY J10 YOM +31 120
#note MOULT, same spot, is superior.
>Seth_Lipkin: BEENOOZ C9 ZOE.E +48 231
#note Seth, already taking pity on me, declines to make his 80-point play(s) at H1 here. While looking at Total Scrabble to come up with trivia questions for Elyria, I saw the highest-ever two turn start is Craig Rowland's 200 (surely that's been beaten before or since). Anyway, 263 would've been quite the three-turn start. Can anybody beat that?
>Jason: ?AHLTTU H12 .UTH +21 141
#note Hated parting with the U with that Q in the triple, but board open-age and point-age is required.
>Seth_Lipkin: ABDFGNO B10 BO.ND +40 271
#note Seth played GANOF at K11 for 30 and picked it up to play this. Speedy agrees.
>Jason: ?ADLNOT 5H T.iNODAL +66 207
#note If I can draw that third blank, I'm back in it! :)
>Seth_Lipkin: AFGGLOU N2 GUL.G +22 293
#note Good defense and a nice garbage-dump, but Speedy likes FUGA(T)O at H1, which I don't like. FUGA(L) at O1 would be my pick, but then again, you can't play with Quackle during a game (although we'd make a great pairs team...).
>Jason: ADDEISY A12 .AID +48 255
#note Don't know DAYSIDE. I actually, after the fact, wondered if I should've passed this up 'cause the spot's near-unblockable, but that's probably stupider than the stupid stuff I normally do.
>Seth_Lipkin: AEEFIOV E2 FOVEA +24 317
>Jason: CDEEOSY K11 YE +26 281
#note Normally when I have 255 through six, I'm not down a bingo. :) Liked the setup for the case O.
>Seth_Lipkin: BEGIJNW L1 JING. +42 359
>Jason: CDEEIOS O5 .ODE +18 299
#note Too obsessed with opening the board too soon? Maybe CODE at L10?
>Seth_Lipkin: AABEKUW L12 WAUK +48 407
#note In the words of Bill Raftery: "The dagger!"
>Jason: ACEIIRS A8 RIA +14 313
>Seth_Lipkin: ABEEIPT 15L .EPI +30 437
>Jason: ACEINRS B2 ARCSINE +74 387
#note At dinner, we were talking about the bingos in our game, and I said "Don't forget that great find at the end!", leading to a round of "I thought you'd challenge"/"Yeah, I almost held" jokes. "What's that, top five in probability?" Bowman asked.
>Seth_Lipkin: AABESTX 13L .X +18 455
>Jason: LLNPRUW K11 ..W +22 409
>Seth_Lipkin: AABEIST F2 AI +13 468
#note When I saw what Seth had, I said "Hm, is he leaving outs with that?" Answered Seth: "Mayyyyyybe!"
>Jason: LLNPRTU N8 PULL +12 421
#note Best to play something like PURL(i)N, leave the out in two. But Seth was in time trouble and wouldn't have dinked and dunked me anyway. At first I attributed this to Seth's fast start putting me behind the 8-ball, but chalk this one up to the INVERTER and DAYSIDE misses early.
