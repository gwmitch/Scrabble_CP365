>Mark_Miller: EFY 8G FEY +18 18
>Jason_Keller: DEGNPVX 9F VEX +29 29
#note I didn't consider I7 PYX, which is close and saves the E, but this is best. 
>Mark_Miller: ALORV 7H VALOR +28 46
>Jason_Keller: DGLNOPS K5 GL.P +14 43
#note A case where I overvalue the S.  Q says M3 GLOPS is the play, and in hindsight, I wish I had made it.
>Mark_Miller: DEEINST M5 DESTINE +70 116
>Jason_Keller: DINORST N5 OD +17 60
#note I considered TRINOD(E)S*, and then smartly decided on something that was not phony.  Most of the candidate plays are fishy; this is only slightly worse that G8 FED and 10H TOD.
>Mark_Miller: AINPT O1 INAPT +34 150
>Jason_Keller: DINRSTZ L11 DITZ +31 91
#note I realize there's a Y out there, and figure this gives me a chance to score big with a non-bingo sometime down the line.  I should have found DIZEN 11J, though.
>Mark_Miller: AADOOSU 14J LE.ES +32 182
>Mark_Miller: AADOOSU --  -32 150
#note I thought, hey, that looks pretty bad.  I apparently pumped my fist when the challenge came up in my favor.  I could certainly have used the break.
>Jason_Keller: NOORRSW N11 WORN +21 112
#note 14J ORZOS leaving NRW is comparable?  OK, so it scores more and makes that Y hook on DITZ difficult... and?
>Mark_Miller: EGLSU O7 GLUES +26 176
>Jason_Keller: EMORSTU L7 .UM +16 128
#note If I'm fishing for a seven-letter bingo here, I ought to give myself a chance to play it next turn, but the only candidate that Q likes better than this that gives me a chance at it next turn is 10G UT.
>Mark_Miller: AEU O13 EAU +13 189
>Jason_Keller: AEEORST F9 .OE +8 136
#note I'm trying to set up a line here, thinking that his response will give me some options.  Anyone want to explain M14 OE?
>Mark_Miller: AEEINST 12C ETESIAN +73 262
>Jason_Keller: AEHORST D5 RHEOSTA. +62 198
#note I picked poorly here.  Good find, but I had this lined up as EARSHOT and didn't realize it played in the J column.  The D7 option works for three more points.
>Mark_Miller: ?AEEILR 5A pEA.LIER +64 326
>Jason_Keller: ABGHNOW E11 W.B +28 226
#note I have less than a 1 percent chance of winning.  Championship player likes N1 HOB.
>Mark_Miller: ACI A5 .ICA +15 341
>Jason_Keller: AGHIJNO N1 HIN +23 249
#note Missing H11 GANJA, as well as B8 HAJ[I], but at this point my chances of winning are approaching epsilon.
>Mark_Miller: QUY G3 QU.Y +26 367
>Jason_Keller: AGIJNOR B8 RAJ +28 277
#note Championship player says that H11 JAGRA is best in terms of win percentage, and that my play is best in valuation...  I'm interested in the prospects of C8 JO and 10B JOT as well, though my chance of winning is still low.
>Mark_Miller: CO 14J CO. +20 387
>Jason_Keller: DGIIKNO H1 KOI +32 309
#note No play wins here.  KINGED B1 scores more.
>Mark_Miller: ?ABFMRT 14A FARMs +26 413
>Jason_Keller: DGINO A12 IN.O +24 333
#note Seemed obvious.
>Mark_Miller: BT B4 B.T +11 424
>Mark_Miller:  (DG) +8 432
#note I feel a tad relieved that I didn't play as poorly as I thought in this game.  After eight turns, my equity loss was about 32, and after pEARLIER I was pretty much sunk.
