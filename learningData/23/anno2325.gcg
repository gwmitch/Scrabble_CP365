>Jason: DEILUUW 7J WUD +12 12
>Steve_Tier: AIQ L4 QAI. +28 40
#note Hmm...wonder if I blocked QAT at 7I.
>Jason: EEILSTU H8 .EU +6 18
>Steve_Tier: EEPVY I10 PEEVY +21 61
#note What makes it even more embarrassing that I didn't challenge this off is that it blocked my LOGIEST. Dumb, dumb, dumb.

>Jason: AEILOST 6D ISOLATE +69 90
>Steve_Tier: ABD O1 BAD +32 131
>Jason: ACEEINO G9 OCEAN +19 109
#note Not even on Q's radar. Must not have seen (V)OICE.
>Steve_Tier: HOPT 5C PHOT +29 160
>Jason: AAEFINS F11 FA +12 121
#note And the deadly case of fish-itis starts. One of those turns where the angel on my left said "Play SAFE at 8L," and the devil on my right said "No! Fish, fish!" For whatever reason, I kept listening to the devil, even though I know 12 + AEINS is not greater than 40 + AIN, esp. on this board.
>Steve_Tier: EGM 7D MEG +21 181
>Jason: AEINNSW D4 W... +24 145
#note Only 1.9 points behind the best plays at 8L, but what am I hoping to hit? INSANER/INSNARE doesn't fit, INANEST/STANINE doesn't fit, it's dead for sevens with the L, D, and probably any vowel. Just got stubborn.
>Steve_Tier: EINRTTV H2 VITT. +9 190
#note Put down INVER(N)* at 13B before seeing his mistake and playing this. I might've let it go ... would've given me SIREN(I)AN and ended this insanity.
>Jason: AEINNRS 5K N... +10 155
#note Too many "misses" given the unseen pool, esp. given that the word has to end in S and the spot can be blocked easily. Plus, it's tough to open this board.
>Steve_Tier: AELR 13C LEAR. +16 206
>Jason: AEIINRS J14 AI +11 166
>Steve_Tier: GJNO 3G J.NGO +22 228
>Jason: EIIMNRS 8A RIMS +35 201
#note I finally make a decent opening play. Championship player agrees.
>Steve_Tier: HTU A8 .UTH +7 235
>Jason: ?BCDEIN D10 BIC. +16 217
#note After the game, Sal Piro notices the (RUTH)ENic potential. "Yeah, I know that one," I said, then thought "Wait." Look at this rack and groan. Really stupid mistake No. 2.
>Steve_Tier: DORU K11 DOUR +16 251
#note Say this about Steve, he played some dynamite defense.
>Jason: ?DEENOO L11 OD +15 232
#note Bad mistake No. (whatever we're up to): Should've played OE, same spot. Two fewer but a better leave, harder to block.
>Steve_Tier: AILNORY M11 RAYON +24 275
#note Put down LORAN at M9, then RAINY at M11, and I think. "Holy balls, the blank and X are in a nine-tile bag."
>Jason: ?EENOST 8L SONE +31 263
#note Q says there's a clear-cut favorite, which kind of surprises me. NO at 14E for 15 wins 83.45%, according to a 1001-iteration sim giving Steve IL. OE and ONE at N13 are in the 60s, while this checks in at 57.15%. Hard to say if NO wins, given Steve's rack. He can't X-bomb me at N14 because of bingo comebacks down column O, and if he blocks row 15, I may be able to hit down column N with a three- or four-overlap play, esp. if I have both blanks.
>Steve_Tier: AIILLRX O8 .LIXIR +14 289
#note Hats off to Steve. Q says this is the only win. (Note to self: Never, ever, ever underestimate anybody who's playing in a Div. 1 like this. Ever.)
>Jason: ??EENRT O8 ......Ed +42 305
>Jason: ??EENRT --  -42 263
#note Just as I praise Steve, I have to fault him here. He said "I need to challenge." No you don't. Play AL at N13 for 16 and win by six. Why risk it? Yeah, it's probably no good, but saying "I have to challenge" is 100% wrong.
>Steve_Tier: AL C3 LA. +15 304
#note Blown games suck. 5-5 and not in a good frame of mind heading into round 11.
>Steve_Tier:  (??EENRT) +10 314
