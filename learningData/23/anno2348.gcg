>Jason_Keller: EOORSTX 8H OXO +20 20
#note Prefers 8F; I guess it's harder to bingo with an S from that position?
>Diana_Grosman: ERU 9H RUE +18 18
>Jason_Keller: EEINRST 10B ENTIRES +64 84
#note I started laying down RE(OR)IENTS H6 and picked it up because it didn't go down to the TWS.  This and RETINES in the same spot are pretty even as the optimal play.
>Diana_Grosman: ADVY K9 DAVY +27 45
>Jason_Keller: DILLNSU C10 .ULL +8 92
#note IDYL 12I is best, but I think I looked at this rack and said, "LLU have to go."  Didn't even consider anything else.  Ee.
>Diana_Grosman: AEGINOT 12A GE.ATION +74 119
>Jason_Keller: ADGINOS B3 DIAGNOS. +64 156
#note Good drawing, Jason.  Getting rid of ULL paid off.
>Diana_Grosman: CCK 8A C.CK +51 170
>Jason_Keller: AAEHRTV A1 HEAT +30 186
#note AVA at A1 leaves better.  This wasn't on Q's list, but doesn't do badly (within five valuation points and 3% win).
>Diana_Grosman: BEI A12 .IBE +21 191
>Jason_Keller: ABGIMRV 7F VIG +13 199
#note Phony hook!  Oops.  IMBARK D3, which I didn't know, is best, but this beats everything else.
>Diana_Grosman: EFU 13G FEU +22 213
>Jason_Keller: AABLMNR B14 AM +20 219
#note I considered TIMBRAL 4A nd ALB L12 before settling on this.  TIMBRAL would have cleaned up nicely.  D4 BLANK is best, and don't I get a blank for playing BLANK?
>Diana_Grosman: AEOT C2 TOEA +21 234
>Jason_Keller: ABILMNR 14I MINBAR +28 247
>Jason_Keller: ABILMNR --  -28 219
#note Why is the variant spelling of MINBAR*, MIMBAR, good, when the actual transliterated spelling isn't?
>Diana_Grosman: AHI L12 AHI +22 256
>Jason_Keller: ABILMNR M11 BRIN +30 249
#note MBIRA M9 or BARM M10 is better for score.
>Diana_Grosman: J J7 J.. +10 266
>Jason_Keller: AEFLMNW E9 W.L. +14 263
#note N7 FLAMEN is new to me.  That or 15M ELF are the suggestion.  I felt that my leave was better than it was when I fished.
>Diana_Grosman: ?EILPSS 15F SPLInES +85 351
>Jason_Keller: ?AEFMNR N6 FiREMAN +86 349
#note I found all the possible bingos on the N column.  I figured that I had to play this and that I would get at least one power tile out of the bag for a big play.
>Diana_Grosman: EOQRTU O1 TORQUE +80 431
#note Owie.  Owie.  Owie.
>Jason_Keller: DDEINOP 8L PO.N +27 376
#note That was the game, as I didn't get the Z and figured any attempt at an 8 was futile.  Championship player suggests PIRN.
>Diana_Grosman: AORTWYZ 14K W..Y +25 456
>Jason_Keller: DDEI 2C .IDED +9 385
#note I get the Z off her rack as a consolation prize.  I didn't feel that I played terribly, but the vision and thinking have to improve.
>Jason_Keller:  (AORTZ) +28 413
#note Because of two scoring errors, the final score was reported as 413-453.
