#note I didn't like exchanging here. A similiar situation like one in NYC for me. I think I should take 26 while I can, and maybe draw good tiles. If not, I exchange. If I exchange this turn, there's no guarantee of 26 points next turn. Idk, I like it; Q likes exchanging keeping A in this situation.
