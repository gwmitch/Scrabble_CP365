>Jason: AADELTW 8D WALED +26 26
#note Looked at AADETW and wanted an I. Alas.
>Sal_Piro: DGOTUU 7H OUTDUG +14 14
#note OUTDUG: To surpass in digging (past tense). In a sentence: Seth might've dug himself a hole by missing a bingo on his opening rack, but I outdug him by allowing this phony to stay on because it made a hard decision for me easy.
>Jason: ANOORTV 8L NOVA +30 56
#note Looked at ANOOTV and again no I. Hmph.
>Sal_Piro: FO 9F OF +20 34
#note There was a Polish Day parade going on below us (down 5th Ave., I believe). A marching band came by and Seth ... well, I can't really describe what Seth was doing. I can only assume he was rejected from being Southern U.'s drum major.
>Jason: AEHORRT D8 .HORE +22 78
>Sal_Piro: CCEENST O8 .CESCENT +95 129
#note Held, but wisely unchallenged. Had to stop myself from getting negative here.
>Jason: AEEERRT C11 ERE +10 88
>Sal_Piro: BI K5 BI. +12 141
>Jason: AEINRTU 11H TAURINE. +66 154
#note Missed ANURETI(C).
>Sal_Piro: AEIPSTV 6B SPAVIET +70 211
>Jason: ?FIIOSY L3 FOY +25 179
#note Speedy and Championship Player likes FI(ER)Y; a better leave, certainly.
>Sal_Piro: BDI 10L BID. +24 235
>Jason: ?IILOSW 14M WI. +12 191
#note Hated this play, but didn't see anything better. It's not bad, though.
>Sal_Piro: DPR 10C D.RP +29 264
#note Seth played off OI, fishing into EIOST, and drew OI. When he pointed this out, Joe said "With all the I's and O's we've played? How improbable is that? It's like drawing QZ!" I looked at the board, and sure enough, I's and O's aplenty on it. Said Seth: "Well, maybe I missed something the first time I looked at this rack." Behind and with all his plays closing the board, he passed IOO.
>Jason: ?IILNOS 15G LIONISe +75 266
#note I saw NOILIEs(T) and forgot about it. Good thing, too ... it's phony! Saved by my stupidity!
>Sal_Piro: ERX M2 REX +39 303
>Jason: ?AEHJKU 13L JAK. +46 312
#note (Counted as 45.)
>Sal_Piro: MNOR N3 MORN +26 329
#note Poor Seth lost something like 570-290 to Joe. Near the end, Joe said "sorry," and played AGAROSE along row 15. "You could be coffeehousing!" Seth joked. "That might be phony!" Joe laughed and offered the free challenge, which Seth declined. "We got him on the wrong day, Seth," I said.
>Jason: ?AAEHUZ O1 HUE +27 339
#note Maybe HAZE or ZA along row 14? Championship Player agrees with this.
>Sal_Piro: AGLOT 12F GLOAT +14 343
>Jason: ?AAGISZ 14F ZA +33 372
#note His play made this choice easy. Score, leave one in the bag.
>Sal_Piro: IQ 5A QI +13 356
#note QI(S) instead makes the endgame more interesting, but I don't see how it wins (in fact, under optimal endgames it loses by 39). Don't know what the last tile was, but QI at 7A gives him a chance is the blank's left, I think.
>Jason: ?AEGILS 4B LEASInG +71 443
#note Anti-climactic ending to a good tournament. I could tell Sal was unhappy/resigned to his fate to see this go down, and he was the only non-participant in the "banter" going on ... I felt bad. Only 21.5 points of equity lost in this one, although I should've challenged OUTDUG*.
