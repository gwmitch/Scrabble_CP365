>Ben_Dweck: AABFNSW 8D BWANA +26 26
>Magrathean: EKLOTUU 7F LEKU +21 21
#note thought about outbulk, decided it was too dumb. the choice is between AUK and LEKU. LEKU is the defensive one, AUK is fishier. AUK only hits like 1/4 anyway, though, so to me it makes much more sense to keep it closed.
>Ben_Dweck: ACFLNNS F6 F..N +15 41
>Magrathean: EOOQRTU E2 QUOTE +33 54
#note toque might be a smidgin better defensively. I suppose I was more worried about giving him the T than plays on the D column. or I just didn't see toque.

>Ben_Dweck: ?ENOUYZ 8K Z.OEY +51 169
>Magrathean: AEEIIOW -AEIIOW +0 128
#note YOWIE appears to be the equity play, but with a reasonably open board I would much rather take my shot at an exchange than flounder through a rack that has to include AEI when the board heavily favors consonants.
>Ben_Dweck: ?AHNRUX 4D H.AX +28 197
>Magrathean: EEGHIVY 6J VI.HY +32 160
#note my exchange was a little less spectacular than hoped for.
>Ben_Dweck: ?INORTU 3G OUTgRIN +76 273
#note I wonder if he passed up the 10 points on TORQUINg for the defensive values.
>Magrathean: EEGJLRT H1 JE. +30 190
>Ben_Dweck: AEFIIIT D8 .EFIT +20 293
#note nice play, kurl.
>Magrathean: EEGLRTT C9 RELET +24 214
#note a lot of plays start out around the same value, but I wanted to keep the board dynamic by setting up the lane on column C. quackle suggests LEGIT at 11A, which it thinks bingos 38% of the time versus the 12.5% of RELET. Even considering the fact that he'll be blocking, LEGIT may give me a better chance, though it sacrifices spread.
>Ben_Dweck: AEIINOW E11 NAOI +17 310
>Magrathean: DEEGIRT 12H DIGE.TER +63 277
#note I luck out and draw into a bingo.
>Ben_Dweck: DEIOORW B6 WOOED +35 345
#note Chickened out on WOODIER
>Magrathean: ABPRSTV A4 BRATS +43 320
#note this might be a mistake. I have the option of playing PERV or VERB at the bottom right. there are so many tiles in the bag that it's hard to be certain what's better - fishing for the miracle bingo that might still not win (i.e. he takes the left side for forty and I bingo at the bottom) or being down 25 with a bad leave and a good tile pool and hoping that he has the garbage in the pool. note BRATS over PRATS despite P being in the pool because the P is going to be much more useful and I'm not going to be winning much of anything with BP or PP. BRATS is also clearly the spread play.
>Ben_Dweck: ?DDIORU O11 D.UID +21 366
#note uhoh.
>Magrathean: AGIMMPV H12 .AMP +27 347
#note a tough position to be in - given that there is no way to win, how do you minimize the changes of an outbingo? unfortuantely, a lot of bingos hit from the J up top. but evidently DAMP is just barely better than fishing off the M at N5. might have to take a closer look...
