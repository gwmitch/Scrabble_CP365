#note The duck didn't even consider my play among its twenty or so.  It didn't fare well in sim, scoring almost 10 less than the winner VOID D3.  Color me surprised.  VOID has the best leave possible with this rack, but it makes the board much friendlier for him.  VOID at 14F was second best, 2.7 back but I like the way it keeps things tighter.  I also thought that my play was shutting down the board nicely, but perhaps its key flaw was shown by the game continuation.  On a side note, I was aware that I was creating the front A hook, but I thought that was less of a concern than keeping an I over an O with MOAN, since four O's and only one I had been played.

#note This seems like a trading rack, but I liked what AFT did to the board so much, killing his most likely bingo line at M9 without giving an S hook, and I figured that there was a good chance to pull a vowel to score with the X at B2.

#note I didn't think of the pretty 62 point KyLIX, but my play should be at least as good.

#note It's a tough call between this and FIB or RIF at M3, not in the least because I may be doing him a favor by opening up column C, since if he has the other blank he's probably closer to bingoing than I am.  But I also liked turning over the extra tile here to possibly beat him to that blank.

#note The key moment.  What would you do?  I really have no idea what's right here.
>Dave: ??BGGLR M3 B. +8 366
#note This was such an agonizing choice between playing off the lone B, GIB and GLIB.  On the one hand, the game is very close and I've got too many consonants, so scoring as much as I can and clearing them out makes sense.  On the other hand, with both blanks in hand creating the threat to bingo could be powerful.  I saw that any vowel draw would give me CLOGGER or WRIGGLE at 3D, and I figured there was great advantage to playing only one tile and leaving Scott uncertain about what I had, especially because he was running short on time.  The downside is that drawing one of the consonants really sucks for me here.  Quackle thinks I'm an idiot here.  It has my play winning less than 70% of the time, with GLIB at 93%, GIB at 87% and BO L3 at 76%.  Why BO should be so much better than my play mystifies me.  I don't trust Quackle's numbers here much, but it might be right that my move was bad.  One thing it does not take into account, though, is that by leaving one in the bag I significantly increase the chance that my opponent will make a suboptimal move.

#note Running short of time, Scott did not see my threat and tried to grab as many points as possible.
