>Sam_Rosin: AADDIIT 8D ADITA +14 14
>Sam_Rosin: AADDIIT --  -14 0
#note I guess I confused AGITA and ADYTA here. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: FNOORU 8G UNROOF +26 26
>Sam_Rosin: AADDIIT 9E DITA +11 11
#note OIDIA K8 12 would have been much better here. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ABENOTY 10H BAYONET +77 103
>Sam_Rosin: ABDGIIM 8A IAMBI +39 50
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ?ACEIMR N8 MA.RICEs +72 175
#note AEROnOMIC K5 98 is awesome. I think the row 11 words--ChIMERA 11D, ClAIMER 11C, etc.--are better here.
>Sam_Rosin: ADDEGIT O4 GAITED +45 95
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: HIW 15L WI.H +39 214
>Sam_Rosin: DEOOTVY 11I TOY +29 124
#note TOYO 11I looks best...amazing how I can play TOY and miss TOYO. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AEEKPRS 7A SPEAKER +92 306
#note Great fit, and the only bingo!
>Sam_Rosin: DENOOTV 12L VO.D +20 144
#note And after I picked my tiles, I noticed that she even blocked my bingo.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EGLNOU 12D LOUNGE +21 327
>Sam_Rosin: EEILNOT I1 ENTOILE. +60 204
#note Desparation phony.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ALRX 1H R.LAX +60 387
>Sam_Rosin: EEGOSUW 13C WOE +16 220
#note Quackle's only play with ANY win% is WEES 10B, clocking in at 0.01%. This wasn't too bad, I think, though I could have played it for an extra point at 7K.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: EFQU 5H F.QUE +34 421
>Sam_Rosin: ?EGIRSU 3D tURGI.ES +60 280
#note Actually the only bingo in EGIRSTU?, believe it or not. Is RELAXERS 1H better? It has higher equity, but this has a higher win%. 
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ERS 1H .....ERS +45 466
>Sam_Rosin: ACINNST 6I .INT +23 303
#note I didn't know STANNIC 14E, meaning 'pertaining to tin.' Sn is the chemical symbol for tin, as the Latin 'stannum' means tin. STANNUM is also good in our dictionary, meaning 'tin.' Anyway, LINN 6I sims better here, and so do CANST 10B and STANNIC. STANNIC could be a little risky because of the potential to get Z or V-stuck (the J would play at E11 and K7 after STANNIC).
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ADHJLVZ E11 Z..AL +28 494
#note ZA N5 is best here by a litle.
>Sam_Rosin: ACNPS L4 N.. +6 309
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DHJV D6 J.. +12 506
>Sam_Rosin: ACPS 15D C.APS +36 345
#note I went over on time here by a minute, so the final is 506-355. I hadn't even noticed I was low, I guess I wasn't really paying attention. Not too big of a deal.
