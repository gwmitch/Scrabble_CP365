#note Martin held, and when he said "I don't like it, but I'll let it go," I thought "Oh great." It is good, though.
>Martin_Weisskopf: DHTU I5 THUD +18 18
#note OK, that could've been worse.
>Jason: ?ENNOTU E3 NEUTr.NO +64 84
#note Missed the double-doubles UNgO(T)TEN and cONT(I)NUE here, as well as other bingos that aren't risky. And let me take this time to register my one minor complaint with the tournament: G.I. Joel handing out blank designation slips one per board at a time. Yes, I like avoiding waste as much as anybody. But we started early, Joel's a little behind, and I'm spending almost 15 seconds of my time looking in vain for a blank slip. Martin graciously said "I know it's an R; I wrote it down before you designated it," so I just circled it when it finally arrived, but that was a minor pain, not having a slip until after the game started a few times.

#note Frank and Robin sat down two boards over. Frank opened with WALKInG for 86, and Robin commented that it was another blank for her opponent. I think Frank said she said she hadn't drawn a blank all afternoon (which isn't true, since I saw her play INvADIN(G) on Kate when I played Appel).
>Jason: ABDGIOT D10 BOG +20 104
#note Played too short here. BIOG is better. Speedy says BIGOT, too, but that's a little risky for me. Star play is DI(N)GBAT at 3C for 30. I'm sure Knappster is making a comment like "You should know that one; you've probably been called it enough!"

>Jason: ACDIIRT A1 DIT. +42 146
#note "Yeah," Martin sighed. "Worth the risk," I said. How was he supposed to know he was letting me clean up my rack for 42?

#note The leave after CEIBA is better.

#note I can never remember POILU.

>Jason: ELOORTT 3G T.O +5 211
#note Boy, I hated this play. I knew I was hemorrhaging hella equity, but I felt like blocking Martin's potential bingo (I felt he was close from his past two plays) and gumming up the board was the right thing.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ANY C11 NAY +17 157
>Jason: ELORRTU 1D TROU.LER +61 272
#note Wasn't sure, but it's good and he didn't even hold.
>Martin_Weisskopf: NOOS L1 SOON +22 179
>Jason: ?CDEEIT M3 rECITED +78 350
#note I is luckbox. Funny how I can shuffle for three minutes and not see the play I saw as soon as I punched the rack in: EIDETiC! I wanted to throw the C in an open quadrant to shut it down and I would've sacrificed the eight points to do it. The other 78-pointer, DECEITs, is probably better given vowel placement.

#note (H)EADIER scores one more and accomplishes the same thing.
>Martin_Weisskopf: ESX K9 SEX +44 256
#note It was about this time Robin played RETSINA and pulled ZAPPERS out of the bag, which she played to complete a comeback vs. Frank. I think I cringed as I heard Robin's "100." And, as Frank said, she was more upset about it than he was! It became a running joke that night and the next morning, though, with Robin later saying that Quackle agreed with ZAPPERS. "Not PREZAPS?" Frank asked. She said she thought about playing REZAPS to keep the hook tile, or play ZA for 40-some in another part of the board. :) When Frank told Marjorie Schoneboom about the ZAPPERS play, she said deadpan: "And did you hit her?" At  breakfast Sunday, Robin pretended to fire at Frank, and said "What am I doing?" Answered Frank: "You zapped me enough yesterday!" Then Robin went into a rant/monologue I wish I could've recorded for Pete's sake. :)
>Jason: AAEEFGS K3 FAG +22 395
#note Missed it at B12, which would've blocked his bingo. I confess to being on autopilot at this stage.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AFINORS 14A INSOFAR +81 337
#note Makes me wonder what he drew. Why not SAX or SOX the turn prior to keep the E? Did he draw into RINS? I think I said something like "nice," and he said "Too little, too late."
>Jason: AEEGKMS 15F MEEK +36 431
#note I can come all the way across from 15D! SAMEK (which I didn't know) or MAGES (which I did). Gah! Should've seen MAGES. Q says this is 18 behind. Damn autopilot.
>Martin_Weisskopf: AJOPW G5 JOW. +28 365
#note I didn't see this or the real best play, JAW at N2.
>Jason: AGS 13J GA.S +12 443
#note Before I could apologize to Martin for outdrawing him (again), he said "Well, I didn't play well and you played superbly." Aw. Not entirely true, though; for example, I missed GAS at N2 for six more here. Off the schneid and back above .500 as 6-5 heading to dinner. Still a disappointing session, though.
