>Jason: ACDIKRU 8E DUCK +22 22
#note Looked hard for a five, couldn't find it. Afterward, asked Stock and Kevin McCarthy what they'd do with this rack, and they agreed with DUCK. We all missed KAURI, the star play.
>Dan_Stock: HP F7 H.P +8 8
>Jason: AAFIMRR H8 .AFIR +13 35
#note Saw the star play, FARA(D), literally a second after hitting my clock. Don't worry. I'm about to be handsomely rewarded for this mistake.
>Dan_Stock: ?DEORSZ 11C ZEbRO.DS +84 92
>Dan_Stock: ?DEORSZ --  -84 8
#note Wondered if he was baiting me here, not playing iOD(I)ZERS (or oDOR(I)ZES, as it turns out). I could tell he was struggling with what to do, and I didn't see a myriad of options to go "Why would he play this with 20 valid ones?" Stocky always gives it to you straight: "I'm not sure," he said as I neutralized the clock. I asked if he was fishing for the challenge, not playing the double-double. When I told him, he was upset at himself for missing it, esp. when the challenge came back. (Kind of what I was hoping for, to get him upset at/doubting himself ... a little gamesmanship-py, I'm not exactly proud.) "I'm guessing you won't be leaving it open?" he asked. "Uh, no," I said.
>Jason: ABDIMRS I9 BAD +24 59
#note Speedy's choice; inserting Dan's rack into sim, there's no clear-cut favorite. Can't stop the big play next turn.
>Dan_Stock: ?DEORSZ 10H ..ZED +38 46
#note Figured he'd play (FA)ZE and keep the D as a hook tile. We both couldn't see DOoZERS.
>Jason: AIIMNRS L10 .IM +12 71
#note With 26 of the 28 E's, O's, and T's out, I've got a good shot of getting a stem. In hindsight, though, AMI(D)IN (which I didn't know) or MI(D)AIR. Considered MI(C), but thought that might give him a double-double.
>Dan_Stock: ?LORSVW K7 VOW.L +26 72
#note Missing WOLVeRS.
>Jason: AILNPRS M11 PAL +19 90
>Dan_Stock: ?GORSX N12 GOX +30 102
>Jason: INQRSTT -QT +0 90
#note Speedy likes STIR for 35 at O12, probably better in sim given that Dan has ?RS.
>Dan_Stock: ?EGIRST O7 GoRIEST +85 187
>Jason: INORSTT 13B INTORTS +79 169
>Dan_Stock: AAIN E4 NAIA. +17 204
>Jason: DEEELOR 14A ODE +16 185
#note E's! Where were you guys three racks ago? (PAL)E's an interesting play, and Speedy's pick.
>Dan_Stock: AYY D3 YAY +27 231
>Jason: EEFLNRW 14K FLE. +20 205
#note FLEW at F2 is the star play. Just whiffed.
>Dan_Stock: AEN 15I NAE +8 239
>Jason: ?EEENRW C5 RENEWEd +70 275
>Dan_Stock: AQU C1 QUA +34 273
>Jason: BEEEIST F2 BEE +14 289
#note Not often you draw three E's twice after bingoing. Championship Player's second pick behind BEE(R) at 12E. (Counted as 15).
>Dan_Stock: CGINO 11A CO.ING +16 289
>Jason: EHIISTT A7 STIT.H +45 334
#note Ooh! THEISTI(C) could've put it away!
>Dan_Stock: JO B3 JO +22 311
>Jason: EILNOTV 1C .I +12 346
#note Loses 16.7 equity points, but best according to Championship Player. Blocking stuff like ROQUE, MAQUI and even the basic SUQ up there.
>Dan_Stock: U I14 U. +2 313
>Jason: ELNOOTV G1 VET +14 360
#note Thought I'd better make him bingo from the V as opposed to the B. He can't do either. But if the R's in the bag, UREMIAS at N2 sinks me. So, something there like (O)VOL(o) (which I wasn't sure of) is the play. In my defense, both of us were low on time ... consider how long the ZEBROIDS* exchange took on each end without a tile having been played in the end result.
>Dan_Stock: AEIRRSU 1G .AIR +21 334
>Jason: LMNOO N8 NOM +24 384
#note MOO at B6 is three better.
>Dan_Stock: ERSU K1 SURE +12 346
#note We both made our share of mistakes, but fortunately I made fewer. 2.5-.5, +46.
>Dan_Stock:  (LO) +4 350
