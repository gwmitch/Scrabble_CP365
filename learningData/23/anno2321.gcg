>Dave: AGIMNOV 7H MOVING +23 49
>Sam: LLLMOUY M7 .ULLY +10 42
#note S: Liked it over GLUMLY.
>Dave: AAAOTVZ L4 AZA. +26 75
>Sam: ADILMOO 5J MO.O +30 72
>Dave: AIORSTV D3 VIATORS +82 157
#note D: I totally blanked on the front A hook that I was creating here.  It's not a big difference, but given how tight the board is already, it's probably better to play TRAVOIS.
>Sam: ADIILRT E9 .ILD +16 88
#note S: I hadn't seen stupid AVIATORS here. As soon as VIATORS went down, that should have been my first thought. LIARD 2B looks best. OIDIA I7 is also good, I saw LOID but not OIDIA.
>Dave: ABBNOST 8K TS.BA +41 198
>Sam: AAIRRTU 5D .URA +8 96
#note S: Didn't know URARI 2B, which looks best to me. Quackle likes AURA 2A? I had seen AVIATORS at this point.
>Dave: BEGKNOT M2 KOB. +24 222
>Sam: ADFINRT N1 DIF +31 127
>Dave: EEGNNNT O1 EN +22 244
#note D: I was pretty happy with this play and didn't look too hard for alternatives.  TENGE H1 is a bit better.
>Sam: AIJNRTT 11I JANT. +30 157
#note S: I prefer this to JOT 7C
>Dave: EEGINNT O8 .NTIGENE +83 327
>Sam: DGIORTU 3B GU. +14 171
#note S: GOURD 12A increases my win% from .03% to .15%
#note D: At this point, I'm winning the tile turnover battle 36-26.
>Dave: ACEEEER 14J CAREE. +28 355
>Sam: CDHIORT H1 ICHOR +38 209
#note S: Q's suggestion of ITCH D12 looks better.
#note D: He's so far back that it's not a major concern, but I would have played CHOIR instead of ICHOR because it gives a better chance for a bingo from 1A.
>Dave: EENOPSX 2E EXE. +29 384
#note D: With my lead it was an easy choice to pass up some of the better scoring plays and keep the board tighter.
>Sam: ADEFHOT 13K FOH +35 244
>Dave: ENOPSTW 1A STOWP +46 430
>Sam: ADEEILT D12 EL +10 254
#note S: I like this play.
>Dave: ??DEENR 14B moDERNE +70 500
#note D: The duck's suggestion of REDNEck would have avoided giving him the big scoring spot I did.  During the game I worried that dangling an R at B14 might help him bingo, but there's nothing there.
#note S: By the way, nice rack, Dave.
>Sam: ADEISTY 15D STEADY +54 308
>Dave: R -  +0 500
#note D: Challenged ELDS.  I lost 19 extra spread points by coughing up the turn, compared to the 74 extra I could earn if STEADY comes off the board.  By those numbers, it's in my favor to challenge if I think that the likelihood of ELDS being good is less than about 80%.
