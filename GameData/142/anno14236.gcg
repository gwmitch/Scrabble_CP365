#note what kind of draw is that?? I saw VENEERER and chickened out, and my cardbox claims that DEEPENER is in cardbox 7 but it doesn't look too familiar...in any case since not bingoing is pretty good I should only play the bingo if I'm really sure about it.

#note I'm often not greedy enough when holding a blank, but I didn't think of how much the N helps the G - WEE is the play

#note oh no I thought about roughdrying earlier but I forgot about the possibility! huge miss. That said I do like what GOD does to the board here, killing the only bingo lane and taking a 37 point lead.

#note in retrospect, I think it would've been better to try to outrun. With AY or AB this turn and 2A on the next, I have an ok chance of being able to fade the bingo when it comes. but I didn't like the chance that he would fish again next turn at C7 - in that case he's homed in on his ideal rack and I may just not be able to score enough. I was also low on time from having to look at that stupid EEEENR? rack for so long earlier. Maybe BY at 7M to reduce the impact of a disaster draw (the pool is likely very junky)? Maybe just KAB or KAY even though it gives him more time to fish? Is AB better because it holds the Y in case he plays JOE next turn? hard to say

#note this is the chain of events I always should've anticipated after WOE. he told me he actually drew the blank after this play.

#note this is pretty awful. I failed to recognize the Y as the biggest threat for a bingo on the board. with his actual rack, after VINY, I win. sigh. hard to figure that out under time pressure though. I go from winning 7/8 to 5/8, but in reality the error is worse than that because he probably didn't have AHLSTV last turn.
