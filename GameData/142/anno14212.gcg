#note More open than LODESTAR, and I'm probably going to benefit from the hotspots more than Scott, as GAUD didn't leave the J (and probably not the X).

>Rafi: CDHIIRU O1 CHI. +30 243
#note Tough decision. I liked CHID because I open up a lane for 8s that is difficult to block with a ZA play. The downside is that I already have an open C, and DIRU isn't very bingo prone. HI/SH is another decent option, but the lane I open will usually get blocked immediately. HUIC (champ player's choice) is good leave wise, but doesn't open up a usable lane. I think I have to play CHID.

>Rafi: ADIMRRU G1 RAM +26 269
#note I wasn't sure how to win this game, and didn't see anything better than RAM at the time. RAM scores well and gives me a shot at DIURETIC/DEUTERIC and other bingoes through the O but my lanes are going to be shut down in a hurry. Couldn't think of any play that was better though - AMU leaving DIRR which cannot bingo to the C pretty much forces me to draw EE? or ET? or something like that for STIRRED/SERRIED hooking POGEY. (S)AID looks pretty good, leaving the C open and giving me a chance to draw TURMERIC. I think SAID is the play - I need to leave that C open in the top right to have a chance because Scott is probably going to block the left side.
