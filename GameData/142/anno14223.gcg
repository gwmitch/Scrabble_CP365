>Joshua_Sokol: EFILLMU H4 FILUM +28 28
#note First game, first move, best. I must admit I'm a bit intimidated by the fact that I'm first playing 5th seed, but we'll see how this turns out.
>Brandon_Randall: ACDFIOY 4D CODI.Y +30 30
#note ACIDIFY looks good here too. Pretty close together though.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIJLNN 7G J.N +19 47
#note With two I's out, I prefer keeping a strong LINED rack, but it's close between JUN, JOIN or JOINED
>Brandon_Randall: ADFOPVZ 5E POD.A +35 65
#note Brandon said he thought this was a good block for any possible bingo I had, which would have been true had I not drawn what I drew. Still best play by far, I think.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEILNP 3I PLAINED +87 134
#note Cool, PAN(OP)LIED.
>Brandon_Randall: ADFIVZ N2 F.Z +30 95
>Joshua_Sokol: AEHNNTX L2 N.X +20 154
#note X(A)NTHAN is a hard fin.
>Brandon_Randall: ABDEIOV 5K DEV +25 120
#note Not too sure about this play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AEHNTU O1 HA. +26 180
#note Missed UDO.
>Brandon_Randall: ABEEIOT 8E BIO.E +20 140
#note This or BOITE B6
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACENTU 9I TUNiCAE +66 246
#note Probably my worst play of the game. I thought about UNCRATE, missed CUNEATE and NUTCASE, as well as A(B)DUCENT, (I)NCUDATE or (I)NCUBATE. I also lost a lot of time searching for something safer, to no avail.
>Brandon_Randall: AEEIORT O8 A.RIE +18 158
#note (JUN)IORATE is really cool, but this is a difficult decision to make. Maybe make things a bit more volatile and fish for the blank with (C)OTERIE...
>Joshua_Sokol: ILMQRST J8 S.Q +42 288
>Brandon_Randall: EOORRTT 6C ROT +8 166
#note I don't think Quackle gives this play enough credit.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGILMRT B2 REMIT +24 312
#note I thought of GIMLET, but the 3x3 it opens as well as my uncertainty as to its validity told me otherwise. REMIT isn't even close to best though.
>Brandon_Randall: ?EORRST 11G ROaSTER +75 241
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHILOT H10 H.OLIE +30 342
#note Maybe this play was worse than TUNiCAE. I know REGOLITH... Also missed HOGTIE
>Brandon_Randall: AAEEKNT G7 ..KE. +26 267
>Joshua_Sokol: EGGOTUV 14D OUTG.VE +15 357
#note This should seal it.
>Brandon_Randall: AAAAENT A4 AA +10 277
#note ouch, drawing two A's...
>Joshua_Sokol: EGGLORU 15J LOGGER +32 389
#note Wasn't too sure about LUGGER.
>Brandon_Randall: AAENNTW 15A ANEW +42 319
>Joshua_Sokol: BIISUWY 13A YWIS +26 415
>Brandon_Randall: ANST 9C STAN. +16 335
#note Still content with my performance, minus the UNCRATE and REGOLITH whiffs...
>Brandon_Randall:  (BIU) +10 345
