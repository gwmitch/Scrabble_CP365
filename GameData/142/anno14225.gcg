>Joshua_Sokol: ??ERRTX 5D EXTR.Rse +102 102
#note Messed up the E placement, but still a great start!
>Connie_Creed: EF 4D FE +29 47
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIINU 9G U.AEI +7 109
#note I prefer keeping two vowels to keeping three. I think it's worth losing 5 points.
>Connie_Creed: ILOQRSU 10A LIQUORS +72 119
#note Gave her this though.. AUNTIE was best I guess, knowing her rack.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMNPUV A8 VE.UM +39 148
#note VULPINE, didn't know it and sure as hell didn't know it was an adjective!
>Connie_Creed: AUY C10 .UAY +32 151
>Joshua_Sokol: GILNNOP 8K OPING +35 183
>Connie_Creed: DEGIINT 11G EDITING +71 222
#note INDIGENT is best here... Can't believe she made this comeback already!
>Joshua_Sokol: HILNOPT D12 TOPH +35 218
#note HOLP is better here.
>Connie_Creed: BERY 15D .ERBY +39 261
#note Held her here, didn't sound right but I let it go. Good thing, too...
>Joshua_Sokol: CDILNTW E9 C.W +16 234
#note C(O)W isn't even close to the best play. Didn't know what to do though... W(I)LD sims best.
>Connie_Creed: HSSV 7F SH.V +18 279
>Joshua_Sokol: DDILNTW K4 W.D +6 240
#note Had no idea extrorse took a D prehook! In any case I'm doomed here, unless I get lucky.
>Connie_Creed: BJ M7 J.B +23 302
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIILNT O1 DILATIN. +83 323
#note I know, I know... *Bows*
>Connie_Creed: ALNRS 3I SNARL +19 321
>Joshua_Sokol: AELOTZ L1 ZE.O +56 379
#note Can't remember my last tile.
>Connie_Creed: EF 12H EF +15 336
>Joshua_Sokol: AALNOTT M1 AL.OT +24 403
#note The only way she can win is with a bingo. I took my chances, though I should have blocked with ANATTO, which apparently wins more than 99% of the time.
>Connie_Creed: DE 6C ED +10 346
>Joshua_Sokol: AACKNOT 14H OAK +22 425
#note Here I only saw possibilities on line 14 (ANEMIAS, AMNESIA and MEANIES). I completely missed line number 2. Blocking down low is a 75% win.

>Connie_Creed: AES 3E SEA +14 400
