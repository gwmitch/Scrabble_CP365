#note ZOUK B7 looks significantly better.

#note Incredibly lucky for me that he did not take out this spot.

>Chris_Lipe: EX (challenge) +5 191
#note Probably dumb of me to challenge HELES#.  I knew for sure that HELE# was good, but I couldn't remember which hooks it took.  But in retrospect, it doesn't look like a word that wouldn't take -S, and I think I would have remembered it if it didn't.

>Dave_Koenig: AJLNNRV 2F J..AL +30 282
#note Well that was dumb.   JOURNAL in the same spot is a huge improvement, clearing out two extra consonants.

>Dave_Koenig: CENOTUV K3 COVEN +25 334
#note I didn't like the way this was going, as Chris's last two moves suggest that he probably has a very strong rack, including the last S and blank.  Here I score what I can and take out the 4I-O lane, but there are too many other open lanes.  However, I missed a much better play that not only scores more, but also does a better job of blocking up the board: VECTORED M2.
>Chris_Lipe: ?ELORST N1 mERLOTS +70 349
>Dave_Koenig: EGMORTU O5 MOER +29 363
#note I missed another fine play here: COMTE B4.  But probably better than that is slowing things down and playing CUM B4, hoping to let him draw most of the unseen I's.
>Chris_Lipe: FI O1 IF +23 372
#note My terrible draw of GIII dooms me in this endgame.  I should have slowed down and examined the pool more closely, instead of rushing headlong into this.
>Dave_Koenig: GGIIITU D2 GI. +15 378
>Chris_Lipe: EFHIINW B6 HE +30 402
#note Chris should win this a number of different ways, but his best way is with the beautiful PINWHEEL 6E.
>Dave_Koenig: AGIITU 4J G.A +8 386
#note AITU L12 goes out quickly, but lets him play WOF 4J.  Prolonging the game here doesn't really improve things for me, but I'm grasping at straws and hoping he makes a mistake.
>Chris_Lipe: FIINW M12 IF +12 414
>Dave_Koenig: IITU 12L ..TI +5 391
#note Stopping him from going out, but FIT was a better way to do this.

>Dave_Koenig:  (N) +2 400
#note I would have finished second if I won this game.  I blew lots of opportunities.  Sigh.
