#note Quackle prefers wide-open plays like AGOUTI 6I, but I like this. I'm up by 74 early, and she's unlikely to bingo on this board... and if she does, it'll offer me counterplays in a TWS lane.

#note Supposed to keep one of those I's. Shoulda been obvious to me, wasn't thinking.

#note ROVED sims best, but I don't love it. Beginning to struggle a little bit with time here. Probably should have looked harder to score without opening anything. Maybe if I took a few seconds more, I'd have thought of ENVY.

#note Had a pretty heated debate about this position with a few people. I thought QUOTE was clearly right -- for one thing, I need points since I'm behind now, and for another, it manages bingo lines. If she bingos in line 14, I get a counterplay in line 15, and I might score enough to stay ahead even without bingoing. If she has a bingo after REIN/NUB, it's likely a seven ending in S making REINS, and the board looks kinda hopeless after that. Quackle says I'm wrong though. After QUOTE, there's a 49 percent chance of her bingoing and a 5 percent chance of me bingoing back. Oof. That's bad. I should either play NUB or just keep things closed with BUNYA N4.
