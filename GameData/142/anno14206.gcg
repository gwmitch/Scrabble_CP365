>Jim_Burlant: AAGLNQU 8E QUAG +28 28
#note Q prefers the 8 F placement by a hair.  I thought that the G was slightly less bingo prone than the A, and that this minimized the danger of an S back hook, though my thinking may have been slightly paranoid for this stage of the game.  But that said, I benefitted from this.

>Jim_Burlant: ABELNTU E5 BAN.UET +72 100
#note Good thing for me she blocked the bingo, as I'd have otherwise never looked for this, which would have been the better play than the natural bingo.
>Pat_Barrett: FOOTY F10 FOOTY +42 53
>Jim_Burlant: AEILMVW F4 VAW +34 134
#note Bit of a surprise - I'd have thought this to be a slam dunk, but Q says F3 VIEW, which only scores one more point, is a 4-1/2 -point favorite and wins 2% more often.  Really?
>Pat_Barrett: AAEGNST 4F .ANTAGES +76 129
>Jim_Burlant: EEILMMN 3G ME +16 150
#note The old refrain kicks in: you have to know it to play it.  MELAMINE plays at J1 and scores 66.  Apparently, the best non-bingo is 3G MIEN.  Perhaps, but this worked out.
>Pat_Barrett: ALW 2F LAW +19 148
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEILMN K4 .ErMINAL +90 240
#note Luck box.  GLEAMING would have been better defensively as it doesn't create a Z hot spot at J10, nor does it give back IZARS/IXORA at 8K.  Quackle is right when it says this play wins a little less often than GLEAMING, and I do pay for this later in the game.  
>Pat_Barrett: IO 7C IO. +4 152
>Jim_Burlant: EGIORRT 13C GRO.TIER +72 312
#note LUCKBOX!!! Or at 13B.  This is nominally the sim winner, but the reality is that either placement is as good as the other.  
>Pat_Barrett: EITY 3L YETI +23 175
>Jim_Burlant: ADEFNSX 2M FAX +45 357
#note This sims with the highest equity.  But a better and safer play would have been 8K INDEX. This gives back a bunch of non-bingo triple-triples (e.g.:  O(XI)DATED) that could get her back in the game.
>Pat_Barrett: ?Z J10 Za +62 237
#note And if I play GLEAMING like I should have a few turns back, she doesn't get 60 for the Z.   Completely preventable.
>Jim_Burlant: ADENORS C2 ANERO.DS +70 427
#note I seriously considered OXID O1 to prevent the non-bingo triple-triple threat.  Why this? I got greedy.  It's rare when a natural bingo is not your best play at this stage of a game, but Q is right - OXID for 42 was the play.  Fortunately, I didn't get burned. 
>Pat_Barrett: JNS H12 J.NS +57 294
>Jim_Burlant: DEEKORU O1 O..DE +45 472
#note For the last several turns, everything has won 99.xx%. This is the only play that crosses the line to 100.
>Pat_Barrett: CHIN B1 CHIN +32 326
>Jim_Burlant: BEEKPRU B7 PEEK +31 503
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  While the only thing left to be settled at this point is the final score, I don't want to let her close spread with an easy 7 down the A column.  While this is certainly a strong play, PEKE D1 scores 14 more points and accomplishes the same thing.
>Pat_Barrett: DE 11E ..ED +18 344
>Jim_Burlant: BHILPRU L11 BUHL +22 525
#note Quackle says a few plays sim with a little more equity, but that's a red herring.  The best plays here are all variations on the same theme:  eliminate any 80-point spread saving bingos on row 15, and this gets the job done.  Q likes BUHR a bit more - whatever.

#note Missing A3 TORR 12.  While I'm not beating myself up over missing a bingo I'd never seen, there were still minor mistakes within my control - GERMINAL instead of GLEAMING, playing ANEROIDS when I should have taken 42 for OXID and drawn 2 to AENRS.  If Pat had had a fraction of the outrageous luck I had this game, I might not have gotten away with the latter one.  A good illustration of the old adage, "Find a good play, look for a better one."  I didn't do enough of that this game.
