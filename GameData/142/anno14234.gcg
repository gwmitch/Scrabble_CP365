#note scott's one of my favorite opponents in scrabble. He's gracious and it seems like we have similar attitudes. Unfortunately I always seem to play him when I'm at an energy low. Hopefully next time I have a better attitude.
>JD: ?BEHIRT E7 B.TcHIER +74 74
#note I was kinda tired so I stared and stared and stared at this rack but there is no star play...just playing ZIBETH is fine too.
>Scott_Appel: ASUV I5 VAUS +24 74
>JD: CDMNOTU 12D D.CTUM +24 98
#note got lazy here and didn't seek out my best play of MUCOID. Only a difference of a few equity, but...
>Scott_Appel: DENOOUW 13I UNWOOED +79 153
#note in this case making the right play would've prevented the UW bingo. oops.

#note scott's giving up a lot of points to do this. interesting move.
>JD: GILNSTV 6H L.V +14 176
#note big error. TAV has to be wayyyy better here. my winning chances are probably sub-10% no matter what I do but at least TAV makes scott have to work harder to block.

#note see?
>JD: BEGINST 13C GE. +11 187
#note quackle becomes not so useful at this point in the game since scott will be all-out blocking from here on out. Quackle's favorites are BE, BEG or GIB, but all three leave pretty easy blocks (although I could hit a -STING/SLAVE bingo). looking a little deeper for some plays, a few options I didn't consider are GIBES at G2 or GIBER at 14A which fork the board (at least temporarily). I don't think my play is terrible, but in retrospect I should've tried BE and hoped that he blocks wrong or something.
>Scott_Appel: EMR 10B MER. +11 284
>JD: BGILNST G7 L.B +9 196
#note I'd rather not block my -STING spot but the only alternative is playing CEILING - that doesn't seem right. maybe he'll overlook my new lane.
>Scott_Appel: EFY 9A FEY +26 310
#note hey that actually worked

>Scott_Appel: AQU 11A QUA +23 333
>JD: EHIIRRS A6 REI. +21 283
#note at this point I actually have a shot, especially if I can somehow hit the Q. SHERIF trying to draw the blank for the Q play looks better than my try.
>Scott_Appel: APT 6A .APT +8 341
>JD: AHIKNRS 5K .HIN +9 292
#note again, not sure how reliable quackle is here - quackle adores KINARA or KINARAS at B1, but if scott blocks by playing at A2-A4 it seems like that's it for the game. Turning over more tiles gives me a better shot at the blank but also ends the game faster. With my play I was hoping to draw into QUARK or a big play on column O after a low-scoring blocking play on his part, or maybe giving myself a chance to fish next turn. But I am probably down too far for this to have any chance to work. playing SHERIF last turn would've helped a lot. still not sure what to do.
>Scott_Appel: AGP O4 GAP +18 359
>JD: AAEKRSS M4 A. +2 294
#note I was pretty pumped when I saw this play. this is just about the best outcome that I could hope for given where I was after CEIL. NTH wins him the game after this, and he can often outrun me even with something like LOOPY or burning the blank to make a Q play, but this makes his life much more complicated.

#note smart choice
>JD: AEKRSSY 3J KYAR +28 322
#note karseys# doesn't go down. RASPY is better than this by 2 points.

#note that was probably one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, but it did have a lot of interesting strategic moves.
