>Dave_Koenig: ALNOORR 8F ORAL +8 8
#note Several reasonably close plays here.  Maybe ORLON or LOOR#
>Carmel_Dodd: IIIIIII -IIIIIII +0 0
>Dave_Koenig: ADHINRV F4 HAVI.R +20 28
#note I like this at least as much as the other plays that Quackle suggests, but I didn't know the RORAL# hook.
>Carmel_Dodd: ABFR E2 FRAB +31 31
>Dave_Koenig: ADEINOS D3 ADONISE +89 117
#note Oops, I underscored this as 87 and neither of us caught it.
>Carmel_Dodd: ?AEGNRT C7 GARNETs +80 111
#note This, or equivalently GARMENT, is her highest scoring bingo.
>Dave_Koenig: ABFIOOW C1 WOF +30 147
#note I wanted to play FOB C3 here, which is my best play, but for whatever reason I was doubting ODAH.  It's good in TWL!  WOOF B8 is too dangerous because of TWAS.
>Carmel_Dodd: PUU I6 PU.U +8 119
>Dave_Koenig: ABIOTVZ B2 ZATI +55 202
#note T has negative synergy with B and V.  It seemed better to take the points and turn over more tiles here, even though I give her the A column.  Your mileage may vary.
>Carmel_Dodd: ELMO A5 MOLE +22 141
>Dave_Koenig: BDEGOQV 12A VO.ED +26 228
>Carmel_Dodd: ?DENOSW J2 WONDErS +82 223
#note Carmel looked up this rack after the game and noted that she could have played WOODENS# for one more point.  That's how you know she's a player.
>Dave_Koenig: BGILQTY 4H QI. +22 250
>Carmel_Dodd: DENP 11B P.NED +28 251

>Carmel_Dodd: EE F1 EE +11 262
>Dave_Koenig: BGLLSTY 3I ..LTY +30 322
#note Much better than JOLLY, as the L has positive synergy with the B and G, and there are three more T's to draw but no L's.
>Carmel_Dodd: AEEIRST L2 I.ERATES +68 330

>Carmel_Dodd: AIITUXY L11 AX +41 454
#note Carmel, ever the perfectionist, continued to study this board after the game was over and realized that she could have netted two more points by playing XYSTI, though I would have still won.  She's a fighter till the end and then some.
>Dave_Koenig: C 2H C.. +8 444
>Dave_Koenig:  (IITUY) +16 460
#note Official score 458-454 due to my underscoring of ADONISE#
