>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EILLLMT -MLL +0 0
#note I can't play the L anymore, so I have to exchange. My exchange is simming best.

>Matthew: EEKW 8G WEEK +22 22
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EFIJLOT J8 .OJI +31 31
#note Doesn't play. I didn't see it, however, so my heart didn't sink when he didn't set it up. This is best by far.
>Matthew: FO K10 OF +29 51
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DEFT L9 DEFT +35 66
#note Can't remember the rack.
>Matthew: ?HINOTU H1 OUTsHIN. +80 131
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ABCILOX 3C COBAL. +22 88
#note I'm not playing BOX and giving him 50 points back. That said this isn't a good X setup, or a good play.
>Matthew: EOORV 5H .OOVER +24 155
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IIMNTXZ 6G M.NX +56 144
#note Guess that worked out.
>Matthew: ANNO 4D NONA. +20 175
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: DEIITYZ M11 YID +29 173
#note YETI 4l's that much better? Wow.
>Matthew: ?AINRRS 1G R.ARINgS +58 233
#note The only bingoes here are 58 points.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EGIITTZ 5C TEG +23 196
#note Lol best equity for TEG. That said TI at 5E sims best.
>Matthew: EGOU M5 .OGUE +13 246
#note He scored this at 11. It becomes important later.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: IIISTTZ 12F ZITIS +31 227
#note ZITS/YIDS lol. Wait, this is best? I'm awesome.
>Matthew: AAAAAA -AAAAAA +0 246
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CIMRSTU 14J CRUST +34 261
#note Didn't know miffy. That limits my options enought that the best option (ISM at N4) is 3.5% worse and CRUST is 5% worse.
>Matthew: AANPV 13C PAVAN +36 282
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: GIILLMS O13 ISM +23 284
#note We'll not talk about this turn.
>Matthew: EEL H12 .ELE +23 305
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADGILLP F12 ..P +20 304
#note PILLAG(E)D.
>Matthew: BERWY D10 BEW.RY +36 341
#note The game is slipping away fast because I'm playing worse and worse. This isn't even collins.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ADGILLQ E8 QAID +38 342
#note OMG THIS IS BEST!
>Matthew: DE F9 ED +19 360
#note Missing OUTSHINED/ED. This could be a game losing mistake.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: EGLLRTU 15A UGL. +24 366
#note No win? TOLU best? Weird.
>Matthew: AAAEHI 2N HA +20 380
#note (M)A(W) his only win? He's low on time so he makes a play that would seem more logical at first glance.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: ELRT O2 .LTER +6 372
#note We did a post mortem and thought I would win after TEL. This is incorrect, as it still ties if he sees SHEA/AE/ALE. Good game, although I definitely could have won with better decisions at the end.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand:  (AAEI) +8 380
