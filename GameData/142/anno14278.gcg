>me: ACDILOR 8D CORDIAL +76 76
#note Not a difficult decision.
>matt: EFIJOPX 9I XI +36 36
#note Quackle agrees with Matt's move
>me: ABILOOR 10J BOO +22 98
#note Quackle prefers this.
>matt: EFJOPRT 7H OF +28 64
#note Quackle much prefers PROJECT from M9.
>me: AEIKLRY D8 .REAKILY +92 190
#note Again, not a difficult decision.  Notice also RAYLIKE, which scores less.
>matt: AEIJPRT F6 JA. +26 90
#note Quackle also likes this best.
>me: ?EEGRSU M7 GEStURE +75 265
#note GRUYERES are Swiss cheeses.  It is also a place in Switzerland.  It is also a word I did not think to look for.  GUESSER is also much better than GESTURE.
>matt: EEIPRTT 12F PRETTIE. +72 162
#note PRETERIT is slightly better.  
>me: AHINTTU 14B TI.TH +32 297
#note Quackle prefers THUYA, which has a much better leave and scores one more point.

I also considered HEAT from 8L.  Even HAUNT and UNHAT over JAR are better.
>matt: ACDENSU 5C UNCASED +81 243
#note 14G UNCASED sims and scores better, but it opens the triple lane...
>me: AANRRUZ 15A ZAN. +52 349
#note Quackle prefers AZURE.  In retrospect, I also prefer AZURE, which has a much better leave.
>matt: ABIMNNO H1 BIOM. +36 279
#note This sims best.
>me: AGLRRUV L3 VULGAR +28 377
#note This sims best.  In retrospect, VELAR may have been a better choice, considering that Matt is about to draw yet another bingo.
>matt: AEGILNN 15F EANLING +85 364
>me: DFNOQRW D1 FROW. +30 407
#note FROWN sims best.  It helps me look for the U or I that I need to play off the Q for lots of points.  It also cleans up the rack considerably.
>matt: ?EHPSTY N1 TYPHoSE +86 450
>me: ADEENQW O7 DEEWAN +39 446
#note DAWEN sims best, with DEEWAN a distant second by 8%.  If I draw a U or don't draw the V, I'll be golden. With 14J QI, 1L QATS, 2F QAID, there are lots of scoring opportunities on this board, provided I draw some good combination of tiles
>matt: DEIMOSU 14J MO +22 472
#note EMU sims best, but Matt says he wanted to keep the U in case the Q was the last tile in the bag. Not playing in that spot is a terrible idea.
>me: AINOQTV 1L VI.A +33 479
#note 1L VITA is the best move.  Without the U or an S, I'll have to wait to play QI or QAT in a different spot.
Basically there's no way for me to do better than tie the game at this point.
>matt: DEEISU 14M DUI +17 489
#note Matt didn't know SEIF, so he played this.
>me: NOQT 11C Q.T +24 503
#note Nailed it.
>matt: EES I2 SEE. +15 504
>matt:  (NO) +4 508
#note Overall, 7 bingoes and a combined score of over 1000 is a pretty good game any way you look at it. 

Had I not missed GRUYERES, this game would have been completely in the bag.  Other than that, I don't feel like I made too many big mistakes.

This game lost me 75 dollars and 2nd place, but I sure as heck got high loss.
