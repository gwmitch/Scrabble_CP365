#note If you have multiple options as to what you can designate the blank, the rule of thumb (which I violated here because I didn't take as much time as I should have with this rack) is that you should try to duplicate whatever is in the rack.  I should have made the blank an O and played COOPTED instead, since it provides my opponent that much less flexibility in terms of what there is for him to play through.  This almost bit me later.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: AIOU J6 AU.IO +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: ADENOSV D8 .OVED +22 100
#note No real standouts - any number of options (K4 OVA, K10 DOVEN/DEVON, D8 CAVED, this choice) are virtually indistinguishable in the sim at 1000+ 2-ply iterations.   Style preference.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: EJ 9C J.E +20 30
>Jim_Burlant: AABHNOS C11 BAH +23 123
#note Looked in vain for ER, as HABAN(ER)OS would have been pretty.     Oh well - as for plays that can actually be made, it's this or E11 HOB.  I didn't think it was worth 6 extra points to keep duplicated A's.  Q says I should have taken the points.  Bah. :)

#note Only bingo.  96% to win in a short sim.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: ?GIIORS M7 ORIG.mIS +70 126
#note Best bingo is A5 SIGNIOR 81.
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIRTW 8L W.IT +33 233
#note Considered this and 14J WRIST, and didn't want to leave myself without consonants.  Q agrees - nothing else is remotely worth considering.  91% to win in a short sim.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: EFRUZ K2 FURZE +36 162
>Jim_Burlant: EEILNQR 3J Q.IN +26 259
#note Q wants  me to dump the rack with 3H ENQUIRE - no thanks. Saw ENQUIRE and EQUINE (didn't like either of them), couldn't think of REQUIN, and didn't like anything that gave back O column back hooks.  IMO, REQUIN should have been the play.  This is roughly a 3-1/2 point dog at 1000 iterations and it wins 1-1/2% less often than REQUIN.

>Caesar_Jaramillo: WY F7 W.Y +22 209
#note Ok, he's either got an A or an S.  And if I'd played COOPTED like I should have, I wouldn't be having to worry about defending this spot like I now do.
>Jim_Burlant: EGKLMRX 2K .LEX +32 332
#note I knew this would give back some points at 1M, but given the pool I figured that, worst case, he'd have KEN and I'd trade 32 for 37 and he'd have only gained back 5 points while the bag would be 6 tiles lighter.  This isn't terrible, but there were two better plays available:   MILKER H10 scores 39 and is best.  F12 REX is also a strong play.  I missed them both.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: ATT 1M TAT +21 230
#note Well, that worked out better than expected.
>Jim_Burlant: CGKMNRR K10 R.CK +12 344
#note Yikes!  To the lower division players viewing this game, just because you can't score and your leave is crappy doesn't mean you have to exchange.  The biggest bingo threats Caesar has are on rows 6 and row 14.  I can't score much with this garbage, but I can balance the rack somewhat and I can make it more difficult for him to bingo on row 14, which is what this play accomplishes.  For whatever reason, Quackle gives slight preference to N6 GRIN and K10 MOCK.  I'd make this play again.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: EGNO A12 GONE +36 266
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIMNR H11 .MAGE +33 377
#note No bingos play.  This is a strong choice, but not best - H10 AIMING scores 36.  AIMING definitely would have been a hair better, both for the extra 3 points and for floating the G instead of the E, making it more difficult for him to bingo on row 15.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEINRU O12 .IEU +12 389

>Jim_Burlant: BITUV 15E VIB. +9 458
#note Auto-piloted this to block his out bingo.  Better would have been 14F VUG, followed by BIT 9I.
>Caesar_Jaramillo: DEILNST 4I TI.ES +31 342
>Jim_Burlant: TU L14 UT +5 463
#note Coming on the heels of my round 1 debacle, I'm very pleased with how I played this one.  The only mistakes made were very minor (QUIN instead of REQUIN, FLEX instead of MILKER/REX, IMAGE instead of AIMING), and I didn't cough up big points until garbage time.  This is about as well as I'm capable of playing.
