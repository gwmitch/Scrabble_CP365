>Matt_Canik: LOOPTUY 8D POYOU +26 26
#note Sim prefers POUTY 8H and 8D above this by about half a point. I'm confused. 
>Doug_Riblet: ADEELOU D7 U.LOAD +18 18
#note Doug provided me with his racks for this game!
>Matt_Canik: DFILNTW 11B FL.W +20 46
#note I spent a long time deliberating between FLAW for 20 or FLOWN for 21. Eventually I made this choice, which appears to be correct by a decent margin. 
>Doug_Riblet: EEEGGRT F5 EGG. +13 31
#note Q suggests G(L)EG
>Matt_Canik: BDINRTU E3 DUB +20 66
>Doug_Riblet: EEGKQRT H7 Q.EER +14 45
>Matt_Canik: DEINRTV D1 VEIN +29 95
#note This was another really tough turn for me. I couldn't decide between D(E)V for 18, VERDIN 25, VIRT(U) 24, and VEIN 29. DEV was ruled out because I didn't have an A, VERDIN seemed to be throwing away all I had for not much, and VIRTU seemed to be just as defensive as VEIN while scoring less and keeping a leave that was about the same, so I picked VEIN. I guess I picked wrong, Q has it last of those 4 options, with DEV simming best anyway. 
>Doug_Riblet: AAEGIKT 1A AGA.E +27 72
>Matt_Canik: ACDIRTT 10F CR.DIT +17 112
#note Oh jesus christ. 
I saw CITRATED and just completely forgot it had anagrams. I saw D(ID)ACT and even wrote it down on my scoresheet before wussing out. This is so bad. Blegh. 
>Doug_Riblet: FHIKNST 12H SHIFT +40 112
>Matt_Canik: AMNOSTU L4 OUTMANS +80 192
#note And I get rewarded for my blunder last turn with this? Scrabble doesn't make sense sometimes. 
>Doug_Riblet: ?AAIKNT 6J KA. +17 129
#note KA(F)TAN is a neat word.
>Matt_Canik: EIJLLOO G2 JELLO +21 213
#note The thinking here is that it's tought for him to bingo now, and I'll just turn over a bunch to reach for blanks, in addition to holding an O for an overlap on H. JOLE M1 was just asking for a cheap comeback, and I wasn't gonna have that. 
>Doug_Riblet: ?AEINTX C5 NIX +35 164
#note (A)NTEfIXA is a tough find, sEXTAIN with 5 overlaps is likely something I'd have overlooked. 
>Matt_Canik: BEIIOSV M1 VIBE +20 233
#note Another weird rack for me. I spent way too long trying to figure out what to do here. (G)OBIES is simming pretty well. I still like VIBE as a play- turns tiles over and holds the S in case he tries to open crap up.  It's simming 2 points down to GOBIES.
>Doug_Riblet: ?AAEETT 13I ATE +17 181
>Matt_Canik: EINORST 14D NORITES +72 305
#note Yeah I just drew that. Passed the 13 extra points with OESTRIN intentionally here to avoid opening stuff. 
>Doug_Riblet: ?AAEMST 15H AM +27 208
>Matt_Canik: ?ENNORZ 15A ZONER +50 355
#note lol
>Doug_Riblet: ?AERSTW 8L .W +5 213
#note Q sees AWAiTERS and a few crappy bingoes with OES. 
>Matt_Canik: ?AHIINR N7 HAIRINg +67 422
#note Well I thought this was a word. Oops. I wasn't sure if I should play this now or not- I draw the last 6 out of the bag and let him rack up a bunch of spread with the extremely likely outbingo. Maybe if there's a bingo ending in -AY or -EY or -OY I can even lose, but that seems really unlikely given his last play.
