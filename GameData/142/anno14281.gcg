>Matthew: BHIMRVY H7 VIM +16 16
#note This and IVY are close.
>Daniel_Citron: LLUU G8 LULU +12 12
>Matthew: BEHLLRY H11 HERBY +47 63
#note Nothing else to do here.
>Daniel_Citron: EIOO 13F OO.IE +7 19
>Matthew: EGILLWZ 12J WIZ +35 98
#note Bottleneck at the top here. I also considered WE(B), which is simming best.
>Daniel_Citron: CEENRT 14J TENREC +28 47
>Matthew: EGILLNP 14B GENIP +38 136
#note This is best despite the awkward leave.
>Daniel_Citron: EPU O12 PU.E +33 80
>Matthew: EJLLRST 12C JELL +27 163
#note This is easily the best play available.
>Daniel_Citron: AADNV E7 VANDA. +20 100
>Matthew: DIRRSTT L9 DIT. +14 177
#note I completely whiffed on RIT(Z). DITZ outdoes RITZ by about 2 points in the sim.
>Daniel_Citron: OY C12 .O.Y +28 128
>Matthew: OORRSTT 15A TO.O +30 207
#note TOYOS is worthy of consideration because the board is not very conductive for bingoing. That said TO(Y)O is best.
>Daniel_Citron: AFTW 8A FATW. +45 173
>Matthew: ?AINRRS B2 RoSARI.N +68 275
#note Best. Held.
>Daniel_Citron: AO 7D A.O +11 184
>Matthew: DMNOORX A1 MONO +27 302
#note MONO and OX(F)ORD (A word I didn't know) are performing very closely in the sim and are leapfrogging each other.
>Daniel_Citron: AE 11K A.E +10 194
>Matthew: ADEFIRX C3 DEX +40 342
#note No other options here.
>Daniel_Citron: AIQ 9J QA.I +15 209
>Matthew: AAFIRST N9 SI +19 361
#note This is obviously much worse equitywise, but it shuts down his only lane completely. (this sims best)
>Daniel_Citron: EKSU D1 KUES +38 247
>Matthew: AABFGRT 1D .ABAR +33 394
#note I saw (K)RAFT once before, didn't think to play it. (they both win 100%) (K)RAFT, however, is obviously better.
>Daniel_Citron: ?DEINST 2H ENDITeS +74 321
>Matthew: CEFGGHT 1M FEH +33 427
#note F(I)TCH is three points better.
>Daniel_Citron: R M1 ..R +10 331
