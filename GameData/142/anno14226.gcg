#note K7 AMBARI sims best.  Quackle also suggests fishing with AI.  Fishing didn't even occur to me.  This was probably my hardest opening rack of the tournament as I spent nearly two minutes trying to figure it out.

#note #3.  This is my third favorite play of the tournament because sometimes you just have to laugh at your mistakes.  This is especially funny because I played it at E5 at first then I start thinking "Wait a second, I'm giving up a big X play" and then I moved it down.  I was blissfully unaware of my colossal blunder until I Quackled the game.  Now that I'm aware of it, I'm curious to know what my opponent was thinking. :D   This is definitely a Hall of Shame moment.  But I have moments like this all the time.  My big weakness is that  I don't pay enough attention to what I'm doing.

#note I spent about five minutes here trying to decide if I should play the bingo or play A7 VET.    VET (REV is sim winner) gives me about a 8.5% chance of winning and the bingo gives me 4%.   There are five tiles in the bag with AAE being the only vowels.  I have to draw at least one of them to bingo next turn.  There are loads of bingos in the unseen pool and the unblockable ones I saw at the time - leaving CRSU - were ACLRSTU and ACELRSU.   I'm no math whiz, but I figured the most likely draw is ALT or ANT.  ALT is the optimal draw and ANT screws me since ACNRSTU is a dead rack.  I simply went with my gut and played the bingo.  Good thing too because ABNTT is in the bag. :D
