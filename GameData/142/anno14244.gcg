#note Yuck.  Regardless of how negative the V is as a tile, I felt my first priority was to clear as much of this as possible so I could draw something like AE or EI.   Q thinks TCKL? has good synergy and says I should only play VAC.  Really?

>Jim_Burlant: ?BDETTV C10 V.TED +18 35
#note Not a whole lot to choose from.   There are 4 plays that sim within 0.1% and 1/4 point of each other:  this, D10 DUVET, D10 BUTTED, or D10 BUTT.  I don't care if I do have an E, BUTT seems like it's giving him easy points back since he probably has an E.  DUVET scores identically to this, but it opens up an S hook that may backfire, even if I do have the blank. I like this just fine.  46% to win.

#note Burned several minutes here and gave up when I couldn't find a playable bingo.  Good thing I did - none play. As for this - I couldn't think of TORII, and debated between this and 12A BITT.  I figured that BIRT? was the best combo I could leave myself from this rack, and the worst case I figured was that if he hit row 15 I'd still have 12A BITT as a fallback option.  Q prefers that I play 12A BITT, saying it wins 53%.  This is second best, winning 50, simming 6 points down.  Regardless, this worked out.
>Chris_Cree: EHT 12A TE.H +30 94
>Jim_Burlant: ?BINRTU 15D TURBINe +80 132
#note Q gives marginal preference to TRIBUNe over this; I'm guessing that, since I have to place the blank E at J14, it wants me to place the I at 15F to create a counter-balancing spot?  The only other bingo is I3 INBURsT, which scores 69 and wins 4% less often in a short sim.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEIQRW L9 QADI +49 181
#note I saw the 14J threat, but 49 points for the Q made this the clear choice; if I took out 14J with WARED or WAIRED, my having played TURBINE instead of TRIBUNE meant that I might not be able to play the Q for points on the next turn. Quackle agrees - this is best, winning 70% in a short sim.  The next best plays (WAIRED, WARED, WADER, etc.) score pretty close but win 8 - 9% less often and sim over 12 points down on this.

>Jim_Burlant: EEIJRWY 15N WE +20 201
#note Wasn't sure what to do here - in the absence of that, make sure that I could some token resistance to the O column while unloading the W.  Q says I shouldn't worry about defending and should play M7 WEIR for 26.

>Jim_Burlant: AEGIJOY J8 JOEY +23 224
#note Trading points for defense. Given my history with Chris - who, against me, has an uncanny ability to draw bingos with ERST? in them - I wanted to make sure that his easy S hook down the I column wasn't there.  He also told me post-mortem that he'd been looking for words ending in ER or ED down the J column, which this also blocks.  This play doesn't do well statically, but by the time 1000 2-ply iterations have been run, it becomes clear this is a VERY strong choice and every bit as good as JAY 7C despite giving up 7 scoreboard points to it.  Quackle likes  M6 YOGI.  This sims 1-1/2 points down and wins 61-1/2% at 1000+ iterations.

>Jim_Burlant: EEGIMRV H1 VERGE. +36 260
#note I knew CROZE took the S, but did not know at the time that it also takes a back R.  Knowing that, - the star play is obviously GIVER L2.  While it scores only 1 point less than this, its main appeal is its better board position, as the only floaters are a G, I, and V.  However, within the limitations of what I knew, I didn't have much choice but to play at H1.  While I wasn't too concerned about the leave - this is a very balanced pool with lots of AEINR still available and only a handful of rack killers (FUWY) in it - the board position concerned me, as I really didn't want to float the E.   The sequence that followed was par for the course with the kind of day I was having.  And, as I'll explain later, the consolation I can take:  even if I found GIVER, it wouldn't have mattered.

#note Only bingo.  60% to win.  However, his next rack reduces that to zero.
>Chris_Cree: ?DEHLNO 3A iNHOLDE. +79 382
#note The second straight opponent to follow a mid-game bingo with another right out of the bag.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIIUWY 1M YAW +34 368
#note Sigh.  Any number of better options available, but this one's a moot point - I'm toast.  I was too stunned to play the end game right, so I didn't find his out-in-two.  Not that it matters, except for a few points of spread (which, given how the day went, wouldn't have mattered one iota).

#note Surprisingly, replaying the game in Quackle reveals there was nothing I could do about this one.  Even if I play the superior GIVER instead of VERGER, I doubt Chris misses PAULDRON D3.  GIVER would have resulted in my having a rack of AEEMRSS, with which my comeback would have been MEAS(U)RES through the U in PAULDRON.  His post-bingo rack of DEHLNO? would have yielded a bingo-bango of HOMELAND down the A column, and I'd still be sitting on AEIIUWY and trailing by 6 more points than I did here.  When it's not your day, it really isn't your day.
