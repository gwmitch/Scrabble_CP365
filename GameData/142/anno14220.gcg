#note I like this. Nice and volatile, which is good since I'm off to a crappy start.

#note LOQUAT was a miss. This sims 3-4 points behind. It works out if I draw a big Q play like AQUAE 8K, but I think it's more likely that I'm stuck with a useless Q again next turn.
>Mack_Meller: ABTY 2J BA.TY +38 139
>Evans_Clinchy: AALLOQU 1H QUA +40 105
#note Missing LOQUAT again, although you could argue QUA is better. Scores well and gives little back.

#note I was fine with this because it scored nicely on a difficult board to do so... but it's possible FANG N7 is a little better, keeping a solid bingo leave and opening an A hook. Then again, it also allows hooks of SSSS? that I don't have.

#note Simmed all kinds of blocking plays like FLOE, but taking out the bingos in line O doesn't appear worth it. He has plenty of other good plays that keep the blank, like LOGOI 3I and CO(ANNEXED). Best option is to score, balance, and hope to strike back next turn.

#note Didn't see REANNEXED, but at least this makes bingos easier to hit.

#note No, self, it is not worth 10 points to keep the C out of the triple line. CARNIES is better by far. Did I even count it? Stupid.
