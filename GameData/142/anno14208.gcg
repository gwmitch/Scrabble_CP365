>Wendy_McGrath: GGI 8G GIG +10 10
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILRVY G8 .YVE +15 15
#note Never even considered exchanging Y here - looks like EEILRV bingos with about 60% of the unseen pool. I didn't think of words like LEAVIER and RELIEVE, but I suspect they might not play if Wendy keeps it tight after an exchange 1.
>Wendy_McGrath: EJR 11E JE.R +22 32
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILRSU -U +0 15
#note Well, with the S I feel pretty comfortable doing this now.
>Wendy_McGrath: DGOS 12D GODS +36 68
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILORS 10G .ARIOLES +67 82
#note I spent some time debating how to deal with this rack, then "duh" I can bingo with the V.
>Wendy_McGrath: AFILT M9 F.TIAL +26 94
#note Does she have an S?
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEMNP L10 .AMP +30 112
#note (L)EAP worth the point sacrifice? Sim says yes. I didn't know the word EMPANE(L).
>Wendy_McGrath: IX N13 XI +34 128
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEENOT N3 ACETONE. +67 179
#note lol
>Wendy_McGrath: OW O8 OW +30 158
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEEPRU 4L PU.E +18 197
#note APER(C)U I've never seen that before in my life. Sim likes PEA(C)E but I don't like Us.
>Wendy_McGrath: BIK O1 KIB. +34 192
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIRRR K10 .RA +17 214
#note Despite my bingos I don't really have much of a lead here, so I don't want to cut out too much scoring. Sim likes 5I RARE or playing for turnover - perhaps to try and beat Wendy to the FETIAL hook.
>Wendy_McGrath: ADT 5K DAT. +16 208
>Matthew_Larocque: EEILORR 13C ROE +19 233
#note I'm ready for Wendy to play a bingo down below any moment....
>Wendy_McGrath: ENT 6J NET +13 221
#note Still nothing....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EFILMR 15G REFILMs +101 334
#note There we go.
>Wendy_McGrath: Q J14 Q. +31 252
>Matthew_Larocque: ANNNOTU 3M N.. +16 350
#note Might as well, makes it pretty hard to get a bingo anywhere.
>Wendy_McGrath: EHY 14B HEY +27 279
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANNOTU A12 NOTA +25 375
#note Oh, there's the other blank. UNTO and AUTO set up S-hooks so I don't think they are worth it.
>Wendy_McGrath: CDU 1L DUC. +13 292
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABDNUZ 14F ZA +33 408
>Wendy_McGrath: INOV B9 VINO +11 303
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDENUW 7M B.W +20 428
>Wendy_McGrath: AU 9B .AU +7 310
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEELNU E5 DUELs +16 444
#note Should I actually fish for a bingo here? There appears to be no bingos that she could have, and I have a very high chance to draw one. I played it safe and just went out ASAP, but I think fishing makes sense here to get a lot of extra spread. Also, LUDEs sims better than DUELs.
>Wendy_McGrath: HIIRSST 6C TH.S +9 319
#note She has RISHI for 21.
>Matthew_Larocque: ENO 2J ONE +8 452
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IIRS) +8 460
#note That game was all luck.
