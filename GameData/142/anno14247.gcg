>Matthew_Larocque: ADILOPW H8 PILAW +28 28
#note I didn't know the alternate WOALD.
>Curran_Eggertson: EEJ 11H .JEE +22 22
>Matthew_Larocque: DINNOOY 10J YONI +30 58
#note Whatever, I'll take the chance.
>Curran_Eggertson: IQ 9M QI +42 64
#note Oh yeah, that can happen too.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEMNOOS O5 DOOMS +36 94
#note I think I saw DEMONS, then couldn't stop laughing at MONO(P)EDS, then this went down. MONDOS and MONDES are words too. Still learning the fives evidently.
>Curran_Eggertson: AANZ I6 AZAN +31 95
>Matthew_Larocque: CEENOSU N9 .CE +27 121
#note (I)CONES....yeah I didn't know about that either. (I)CE still does well in the sim though. (J)EU is up there too, but if I'm gonna hang onto the S I shouldn't kill an s-hook in the process.
>Curran_Eggertson: ?DEENRT 13B TENDERs +76 171
>Matthew_Larocque: CENOSSU N2 CONES +25 146
#note I knew quackle would abhor this play, but I like how it creates another s-hook that is akward to try and block. The other plays I considered were SCONE O11 and you-know-what at B10. Sim results have UNCOS N2 and OUNCES N1 winning. I never noticed the shorter plays (W)ON/S at 12H which also sim pretty high. I guess my play breaks the rack apart too much?
>Curran_Eggertson: GOW M3 WOG +31 202
>Matthew_Larocque: ABFPSUU J6 BAP +41 187
#note Nice points, disastrous leave. F UUS, no kidding I hate those things.
>Curran_Eggertson: BDU 12L BUD +19 221
>Matthew_Larocque: EFRRSUU 1L FUSE +41 228
#note This seemed like the sure bet, gets me right back in the game. Sim gives a slight edge to 5K UR(GED). 14 points over 41 to keep EFRSU....is that really gonna bingo that often?
>Curran_Eggertson: ?ADIRTU D6 DURATIo. +68 289
#note Welp.
>Matthew_Larocque: AGIMRRU K5 RAG +26 254
#note Just play MAGI or MAIR instead to the right. There's no dees or blanks left.
>Curran_Eggertson: EX 14E EX +53 342
#note :/
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIMORU 12H .O +14 268
#note The game looks lost so might as well try a stupid idea - looking to hit MURIATE or URAEMIA
>Curran_Eggertson: HNT 5G NTH +23 365
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEIMRU 4B URAEMIA +75 343
#note Ha! Talk about lucky. He had a T as well, so my odds were quite low.
>Curran_Eggertson: AEHLT 15A LATHE +40 405
#note Too much scoring, Curran!
>Matthew_Larocque: GIIKTVV -GIIKTVV +0 343
#note You can have these.... oh but I mised VIK(IN)G.
>Curran_Eggertson: LORY 8A LOR.Y +24 429
>Matthew_Larocque: FIILOS E10 IF +22 365
#note Not sure on my last letter.
>Curran_Eggertson: EIVV 3H VIVE +17 446
#note Curran shrugs off the vees like a minor inconvenience haha.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGIILOS O12 SILO +23 388
#note Need to block his incoming play but I wasn't really keeping up with my tracking too well.
>Curran_Eggertson: KNRTT B2 TR.NK +38 484
#note Yeah, I really needed to block that.
>Matthew_Larocque: EGI J1 GI.E +10 398
#note GIE where he just played.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (T) +2 400
#note -20, wasn't able to get any bingos with my esses. And couldn't outscore him when he had too many bombs of his own. Still, screwing up the DOOMS play and not blocking TRUNK gave him a lot of extra spread.
