>Matthew: BGIMRTU H7 BUM +14 14
#note BURG is best, but this isn't that much worse.
>Ted: INTU I5 UNIT +12 12
>Matthew: GIINRTY 5I .NITY +16 30
#note A different placement of unity is much much better.
>Ted: GIMN M1 MING. +22 34
>Matthew: CEGIORT J8 ERGOTIC +73 103
#note This might win best ROC word. We'll have to see
>Ted: AENSZ 13H AZ.NES +50 84
#note Zany takes an ES? I guess neither of us knew that.
>Matthew: ERSTVWY H12 W.VY +51 154
#note Best.
>Ted: DELRRSU 2H SLURR.ED +72 156
#note Nice play. Blocked TRIREMES.
>Matthew: EEIRRST L8 RETIR.ES +70 224
#note DESTRIER is not a word that I know.
>Ted: EEF 1F FEE +24 180
#note Not sure why he didn't slide that over.
>Matthew: AGOOOUV 1M .OO +26 250
#note Really the only option.
>Ted: AIO 4L A.IO +16 196
>Matthew: AGNOTUV 15C VAUNT. +13 263
#note This performs well in CP, but OUTGNAW is much better.
>Ted: ?ABEHRT 3B BATHERs +76 272
>Matthew: CFGOOPP 4C GOOF +33 296
#note CPP isn't a thing of beauty, but this is kind of necessary. 11 percent ahead of anything else.
>Ted: AX E3 ..AX +28 300
>Matthew: ACDDHPP 2A CAD +25 321
#note I missed CHAP and CHAD off of UTE and M. Not sure why cad is down there, as I didn't want him to hit the triple.
>Ted: AQ J1 Q.A +12 312
#note Lol ZA/VAC is better equity if his rack is AQ.
>Matthew: ?DHOPPS 15L .HOP +27 348
#note (TO)PO best? Guess so.
>Ted: AIILL F6 ILIAL +20 332
>Matthew: ?DILNPS E8 PLaID +21 369
#note Landslip deserves a spot on Ryan Fischers Crosstables forums post. I double tracked but I guess I didn't realise an O was out. That could have been a disaster.
>Ted: ADEEEOW 12B WEE. +16 348
#note He instantly played WEED.
>Matthew: EJKNS B10 JE.S +30 399
#note Board vision! K(O)J(I) is 6 points better. I'm now going to come in second by 5 spread points and regret it the rest of my life.
>Ted: ADEO 14H .A. +19 367
#note He told me he was going for the highest scoring move, as opposed to the highest scoring move + twice the letters dumped + potential blocking.
>Matthew: KN D11 K.N +13 412
#note Played decently this game, but it could be better.
>Matthew:  (DEO) +8 420
