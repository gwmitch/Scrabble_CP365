#note I think I knew somewhere deep down that this wasn't good but I didn't realize it consciously...it's still not a terrible try since it kind of looks like a word, and maybe he'll give me the letter I need if I'm lucky...nice challenge

#note IDEA setting me up for a LAV/V- play is not a bad idea, VEGIE sims about even

#note now why did I think that was good? I blame cesar. there's no reason not to just play BANI here.
>Cesar: FGL J6 FL. +17 209
#note he almost played FLOG instead
>JD: AAINNOR 4H .ANIAN +16 256
#note I should've just played BANI the first time...probably should've here as well, not sure why I was so desperate to flip over more tiles.
>Cesar: ?ACDGNS 1C CANtD.GS +62 271
>JD: IORRTTY 5K TROY +22 278
#note even game, this is a big gamble with the S hook out, but maybe he'll overreact and try to block
>Cesar: JN 5G J.N +12 283
>JD: EEEIRST 10F .EERIEST +60 338
#note I could also just get lucky instead

#note BOZO to set me up for cheap points next turn?
>Cesar: CFOT M7 COF. +30 337
#note FFFFUUUUUUUUU
>JD: ADEEETT H10 .T +2 385
#note I wanted to make sure not to eat the Q, but quackle's right...if I just take the points for BEET now then I have enough other tiles that I should be able to outrun him anyway.
>Cesar: MPU A12 .UMP +30 367
>JD: ADEEETW 13J WADE +26 411
#note I should play AE at B14 to block PIQUE and then out-in-3.
>Cesar: AEIQU 15A .IQUE +17 384

#note trying to get cesar to go over on time but then he made his last play with 00:00 on his clock the whole time!!!
