>Mack: EENRRRT H5 RET.RNER +59 59
>Lisa: NOV 6F OV.N +9 21
>Mack: AEEIKRU 7G U.E +19 78
#note I saw E3 KAURI, but thought this was better due to the superiority of the leave. Although KAURI scores 7 more, AEIRK is a well-balanced leave, whereas EE is prone to vowel-heavy racks. I did miss E4 EUREKA, however, which definitely seems optimal.
>Lisa: ADINOST 12E INT.ADOS +68 89
>Mack: AAEIKNR 11E KA +26 104
#note I considered RAKI in the same spot, but opted for KA as AEIRN is much more bingo-prone than AEN. Also, RAKI allows plays such as 10F ZIN and JIN, whereas similar plays after KA are not nearly as high-scoring. In a short sim, KA sims about 2 points above another alternative, E2 KINARA for28.
>Lisa: ACUY 11K YUCA +30 119
>Mack: AEINNRW N10 W.NIER +34 138
#note This sims best; although it exposes the R in the triple lane, this drawback is justified by the high score and good leave balance.
>Lisa: AEH 15L HA.E +33 152
>Mack: AIJNQWZ 13M Q. +22 160
#note I thought that dumping the Q immediately would be best, but Quackle disagrees. QI sims about 5 points behind E4 JAW.
>Lisa: ACOR O7 ARCO +23 175
>Mack: AIJNPWZ E4 JAW +37 197
#note I also considered 13C ZIP, which sims behind JAW by a small margin.
>Lisa: BI 10F BI. +22 197
>Mack: EIINOPZ 13C ZINE +39 236
#note I thought this play was superior to ZIP in the same spot since ZINE preserves two vowels where as ZIP retains three. However, I believe I may have underestimated the dangerousness of the AZINE hook; ZIP sims about 2.5 points higher than ZINE.
>Lisa: GIPRS J2 GRIPS +28 225
>Mack: ADIOOOP 3H PA.ODOI +22 258
>Lisa: ?ABEIST B8 BESTIAl +84 309
>Mack: EHILNOY L1 YO.H +30 288
#note I overlooked 8A OBEY, which is definitely best. I considered this play and H1 HYP; I wanted to reatain as good a leave as possible, since I will likely need to bingo to catch up. Despite the inferiority of the leave after OBEY, OBEY puts me within 12 and blocks a dangerous hotspot. 
>Lisa: ILM C7 MIL +16 325
>Mack: DEILLNO A7 LODE +36 324
#note Although LODE preserves a better leave than NIELLO does, NIELLO allows me two more shots at drawing the blank. I thought maintaining the superior leave was more important, but, according to quackle, NIELLO is better by about 2.5 points.
>Lisa: EFS 14D FES +30 355
>Mack: DEILNTU H1 DU. +18 342
>Lisa: FO 2F FO. +14 369
>Mack: ?AEILNT 1L .ETI +21 363
#note No bingo plays; I decided against TAJ due to the possibility of VEXT. Apparently, YETI wins 88.75% of the time, and AL D8 wins 100% of the time.
>Lisa: EEGLTTX N3 .LEX +27 396
#note I got a lucky break here; plays such as J12 DEX and I10 EXALT do not give me a high-scoring outplay and will win.
