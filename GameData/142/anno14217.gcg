#note Not worth the extra two points to play this at 2G, giving back huge scores at H1.

>Dave_Koenig: EEEKNPR 14B KREEP +46 270
#note 2J KNIFE is also a very strong play, maybe even stronger because of the PR- setup at O1.  However, this scores even better and is safer defensively, both because it doesn't open the triple line and takes away the dangerous 14B-F and 13C-G scoring zones.  I'm curious which way John would have gone.

#note I liked this better than LINEMAN primarily not to give the X spot at 10B.

#note John saw both of his best valid plays here: HAEMIC and LECHAIM#.  He got a little too greedy and tried a very plausible phony for extra points.  As I told him after the game, it would have been very hard for me to challenge this in double challenge.  However, a problem for him is that even if it stayed down, the board would get so blocked up that coming back would be difficult.  I prefer LECHAIM#, to hope to draw the X for the B6 spot.
>Dave_Koenig: AENORSW 10B WANE +34 404
#note Knowing that he had the C and H, I rushed to take out both the 10B and 10H scoring spots.  This also has the advantage over the equity play ANOW# 12A that it takes out the bingo line on row 9.
>John_O'Laughlin: ACEGHIL 1L ..GA +21 308
>Dave_Koenig: IOORSSU 6L .UI +5 409
#note Holding the last two S's, I block the O1 bingo lane and set myself up to score on column O.  The high scoring play is UROSIS# N7, which I did not know.
>John_O'Laughlin: CHIU 5G HUIC +15 323
>Dave_Koenig: OOPRRSS O6 SPOOR +25 434
#note Now I'm sitting pretty with the case S for row 4, and the CHIT hook isn't much to worry about, since there are no I's for the -IC suffix.
