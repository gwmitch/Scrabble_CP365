#note Sims best... If you're Matthew, you should assume that I have a very large chance of keeping a y with this rack, since there are 2 good spots to score with a Y on this board, and I just played one without using either of those spots.

#note On the other hand, i was very happy to see this go down, partly because it meant there were 2 esses and a blank in the bag that I could still draw

#note Didn't write the rest of this rack down... I wanted to score now and deal with the q later. I don't remember the rest of the plays in this game, but i remember matthew making a play leaving him with 6 tiles, allowing me to win with no problems. I won 409-372.
