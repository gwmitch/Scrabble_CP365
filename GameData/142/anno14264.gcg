>Wayne_Clifford: AINV 9F VINA +23 23
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEFHOX 10I AXE +28 50
#note I overlooked just playing EX for improved defense.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADEKRY L10 DARKEY +48 71
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFHIOY -  +0 50
#note Ouch. I challenged because I thought it was just DARKY, but I have such good scoring plays here that it's a poor idea.
>Wayne_Clifford: AINPT 15G PAINT. +33 104
>Matthew_Larocque: CEFHIOY 13I HIC.EY +44 94
#note I thought that both CHOKY and CHOKEY were phonies, and I played this before I even realised that HOC(K)EY might be better.
>Wayne_Clifford: DG 11K D.G +16 120
>Matthew_Larocque: EFFLORS O8 OFFERS +58 152
#note Lucky draw.
>Wayne_Clifford: CIOV K6 VOIC.. +12 132
>Matthew_Larocque: ADGLOSU 6K .ULGO +13 165
#note I didn't know the hooks on OFFERS so this left me with very little to work with.
>Wayne_Clifford: EHI N8 HIE +25 157
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEOST K4 DE...... +30 195
#note Hard to turn down 30 points on a crappy board.
>Wayne_Clifford: IRTT -  +0 157
#note Wayne didn't like it. Before we went to the word judge he asked the adjacent players what they thought - Juraj said he'd bet 20 dollars that it's good for sure. So I guess it's a good thing I played it on Wayne instead of Juraj!
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEOPST L1 PATE +24 219
#note The leave kinda sucks, but this is the most obvious place to score points - and I wanted to take a solid lead after the break I got from Wayne. Everything sims pretty close here.
>Wayne_Clifford: IRTTU 2J TR.IT +14 171
#note He played (V)IRTU then changed his mind.
>Matthew_Larocque: AENOSST O1 OS +12 231
#note I should be playing a bingo really soon right? There's a nice s hook for me and everything. I thought about SNEA(P) but didn't seem like enough points to destroy this nice rack. Sim says it's a fair bit better though.
>Wayne_Clifford: AGILR 11E GRAIL +15 186
>Matthew_Larocque: ABENOST N13 .OB +16 247
#note Well, didn't get a bingo and the hook was blocked. There's still a chance to bingo on the top though. Maybe I should play BOA 1H just to make sure he doesn't land any big plays there.
>Wayne_Clifford: JO 14F JO +29 215
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEENST 15N .E +12 259
#note This is not a good fish, because only SENSATE or STANDEE is going to bingo at the top. But I still don't want to ruin this rack and draw UUW or some nonsense.
>Wayne_Clifford: IUUWW -IUUWW +0 215
#note hmm.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENNST 12G EN +8 267
#note C'mon Wayne open up something for me I'm waiting! Sim is suggesting SNEA(P) again for points. I totally missed EN(GRAIL) which gives me a chance for an 8. 
>Wayne_Clifford: AZ 7H ZA +24 239
>Matthew_Larocque: AENSTWW M4 WE.T +15 282
#note Play off two letters, draw WW. See! I should exchange WW here.... and TWA 1H is certainly a lot better! Wayne is starting to catch up, so I decided to score. Those blanks are starting to get me paranoid though. 
>Wayne_Clifford: ?NORSTU 1D TONSURe +72 311
#note Okay I'm in trouble.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENOSW 2E WO +16 298
#note I didn't write this down but my last letter would have been either an E or an R. I inserted R for the sim and it doesn't like my play. Suggests NOW perhaps for the E hook. If I had an E, sim still likes NOW or (T)OWN.
>Wayne_Clifford: DILM 3C MIL +16 327
#note I think he said he regretted not playing MILD instead, but emptying the bag would have hurt him worse.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEENRS 4C ENSnARE +79 377
#note I came pretty close to bingoing vertically until I realised that this fit for many more points. Just about every other bingo here loses with my penalty.
>Wayne_Clifford: ADLMNUU 3G MAD +25 352
>Matthew_Larocque: B I3 ..B +6 383
#note Er, (JO)B. Good thing the game wasn't decided by that.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (LNUU) +8 391
#note Okay so.... I lost 20 points on time AND my final 8 points were not added on (I think I made this error before against Wayne too haha). As a result the final score was 363-352. Can you tell I like to bleed spread profusely at tournaments? I came really close to choking this game away, but that's okay because the real chokers are still to come. I've sort of accepted my choky-ness at this point.
