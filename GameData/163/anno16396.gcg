>Josh: DEIINUU -IUU +0 0
#note Deciding game at the club tourney. I have to lose by more than 61 for Gabriel to win.
>Gabriel: OTW 8G TOW +12 12
>Josh: ADEEINR G6 RE.AINED +63 63
>Gabriel: AKO F10 KOA +37 49
>Josh: AAIILOO 7I AIOLI +13 76
#note Hated this
>Gabriel: ?ENORST K4 cOR.NETS +78 127
#note Two nines through (ON), can you find them? Gabriel took way too long here imo
>Josh: ADINNOR F1 ANDIRON +68 144
#note At least I drew this! Still hate my position, I feel like I should need some power tiles
>Gabriel: ENRY 1D YE.RN +36 163
>Josh: BDEGHLP 11E D..GLE. +18 162
#note I had really no clue here. Any ideas? I wanted to keep the H for future scoring but BHP is just disgusting
>Gabriel: EEY H13 EYE +21 184
>Josh: AABDHPU I13 BAD +26 188
#note Ooh, haven't seen P(R)AHU (6J) in too long, forgot the word. I also have the awesome 3C BUD(D)HA and the also awesome 4H HUB(c)AP. I still wanted to keep the H.
>Gabriel: EIVW 5B WIVE. +22 206
>Josh: ?AHMOPU 4H POU.H +24 212
#note still PRAHU
>Gabriel: AJT 8M TAJ +32 238
>Josh: ?ACEFMU 10I AF. +29 241
#note Interesting that ACMU? is better than CEMU?!!!
>Gabriel: HU 3H UH +22 260
>Josh: ?CEIMMU D5 .UM +8 249
#note Man such nice tiles. Spend a while trying to find something, and decided to set up my M for next turn in two spots. I should just play MUCI(D) 3B.
>Gabriel: ILLNOSU N8 .LLUSION +70 330
#note Gabriel is already down a lot on time again, which is a clear advantage for me. 
>Josh: ?CEIMPR C7 MERoPIC +91 340
#note I just have to stay less than 60 points behind here.
>Gabriel: EEFZ B8 FE +12 342
#note nice setup. If he draws any vowel but the E, he has 60+ points next turn if unblocked.
>Josh: ABIIQRX 12L QI. +24 364
#note Twice tonight I missed QAID. 3C this time. I wanted to get rid of my clunky clunky Q here.
>Gabriel: AZ 10A AZ. +66 408
>Josh: ABEIRTX 15L BA.T +27 391
>Josh: ABEIRTX --  -27 364
#note ooh, 14M B(O)X is nice. Here is where I fuck up like no other, cover your eyes
>Gabriel: CG 12B C.G +12 420
#note He's under 1 minute again at least, so BA(N)T is going to mess him up in that respect. He might even falsely infer stuff from my play which is also an advantage! Still really really stupid that I played a phony 4.
>Josh: ABEIRTX M10 EX.T +37 401
#note OK, this doesn't win but I'm pretty sure it just about never loses by more than 61.
>Gabriel: EGOSTTV 15L VE.T +33 453
#note best
>Josh: ABIRS 6J B.AS +27 428
#note I couldn't risk that BRAIS(ED) was somehow no good.
>Gabriel: GOST 14H ..GS +12 465
#note He mistracked, had me with RN.
#note just being as safe as possible, and I managed to win the club tournament undeservingly! :P
