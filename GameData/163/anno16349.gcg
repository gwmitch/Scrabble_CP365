#note Should I play L12 for 1 fewer point because I have an S? Or does his last play deter me from that?

#note Was really confused about this play. I wanted to try and hold onto my lead, bingos are NOT happening on this board, and CZ will help me score the next few turns. COV(IN) is also a good play. 
>Jacob_Williams: AABL O8 ALBA.... +36 341
#note Wasn't expecting the board to open up like that. Nicely spotted, Jacob. 
>Matt_Canik: CLPRTVZ 12I CR.P +33 379
#note I thought this might be invalid when I played it. Whoops! CRIP* 

Ladies and gentlemen, a 1900 player who doesn't know his 4s!

#note Again, on a closed board I'm holding tiles that will score well. Additionally, of the 18 unseen tiles 12(!) of them are vowels. Either he's extremely vowel heavy, in which case he can't score points, or the pool is extremely vowel-heavy, in which case I'm balancing this rack well enough to eke out the endgame. 
>Jacob_Williams: AINOR K4 NORIA +23 384
>Matt_Canik: DILSTTZ J3 ZIT +16 408
#note I'm in an extremely good position now. Q says ZI(N)S actually gives me a 100% chance to win and is the only option that does so. This is listed at 94.7%. I will pretty much always draw vowels into this rack, and again, when I don't he has an awful rack.
