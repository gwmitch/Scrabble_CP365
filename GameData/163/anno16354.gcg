#note Context: 2 games left, if I win this one I'm gibsonized. If I lose, I have to play the winner of Geoff/Robin Lewis for the championship. I really don't want to play a high-stakes game against Geoff. I want to clinch this thing now. 
>Mike_Early: BPU 7C PUB +16 16
>Matt_Canik: AEHLNPV E7 ..VEL +20 38
#note Give how fast he played PUB I think he's holding quite well. This sets up a lot of points for my H plays next turn, and my remaining tiles are great for stack wars if he doesn't bingo. Sim really likes this play. 
>Mike_Early: ?AIINOT H1 IOdINAT. +74 90
>Matt_Canik: AHNOPUZ F10 HOP +31 69
#note (O)UZO is the best opion here, this is about 4 points down. I guess I just got too fixated on the spot I set up for myself. I also strongly considered plying HAP over HOP to hold my O to go with the Z (holding several plays like ZO(O) or ZO(A)) but decided that was too cute. Q thinks it's not too cute, simming HAP ahead bu about 2 points. 
>Mike_Early: ADEGLNR 4C DANGL.ER +70 160
#note Sure, score 11 less than you could have. 

I asked him why he played up here instead of GNARLED/HOPE. He said "well I thought this was more defensive". Leaving the HOPE hook for me is more defensive? Worth 11 points? 
He later confessed that he didn't see the 7s. 
>Matt_Canik: ACDNOUZ 3B COZ +45 114
>Mike_Early: III -III +0 160
#note And now he exchanges 3. Sweet. He's got the second blank, probably. 
>Matt_Canik: ADNNTTU I8 DAUNT +17 131
#note Should this just be DUNT? 
I was trying to partially block HOPE since he had just exchanged 3 and was probably about to bingo, trying to force im to give me A back, or at least B. 
>Mike_Early: CEER 13C CERE +21 181
>Matt_Canik: AINOTTW 6B WOT +21 152
#note I don't like doing this given his small exchange, but I think I need to. 
>Mike_Early: ?EMORTU 2H .UThOMER +72 253
#note Again, misses a high-prob bingo that's 11 points better, this time with OEsTRUM/SWOT. But that's okay, when you draw racks like AIINOT? and ADEGLNR and EMORTU? you don't really need to know words. 
>Matt_Canik: AFIKNNT O1 K.AFT +48 200
#note KRAFT and FRANK and RATFINK all deserve consideration here. Sim surprisingly has FRANK the highest, despite scoring 6 fewer than RATFINK and 9 fewer than KRAFT. It's still within about half a point, but still.
>Mike_Early: DEGY H12 EDGY +33 286
>Matt_Canik: AIIMNNU M2 .INIMA +22 222
#note Ooh MINIUM is a much better play here (about 7 points better), but I didn't know it. I(O)NIUM is also a better rack-balancer. I've got to force this board back open.
>Mike_Early: IQS A4 QIS +29 315
#note another incredible find by mike
>Matt_Canik: IINORSU J2 .U.ION +8 230
#note Had no idea what to do with this turn. I can't score points at all, and Mike's almostdefinitely going to be able to given the number of spots on this board. If I exchange, I'm goingto be down so much that I can't catch up even with a bingo. This isn't a good play here, but nothing really is at this point. My win% has to be extremely low here. I guess I should exchange and hope I get extremely lucky the rest of the way.

#note Nice job mike
>Matt_Canik: EFIRSSW D12 F.W +18 248

#note Well done mike

#note Good work mike
>Matt_Canik: AAEILRS 14H .ASALIER +72 340
#note SALARIES is 5 more. I'm so on tilt here. 
>Mike_Early: BDEEGOR O12 BE.G +30 455
>Matt_Canik: A L11 .A +10 350
#note Every time I lose to Mike it just seems like he's served up these obvious 35-45 point plays on a platter over and over. Losing to him is extremely frustrating.
