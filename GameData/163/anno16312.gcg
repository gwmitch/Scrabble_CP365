>Tim_Weiss: ?ABERST 8D BASTERs +72 72
#note Good start for Tim. I didn't know this word.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEENORR 7G ERE +13 13
#note I should probably play (B)OREEN or ENRO(B)E, maybe even ENRO(B)ER.
>Tim_Weiss: AINRY D8 .RAINY +22 94
>Joshua_Sokol: ENORTVW F4 VROW. +20 33
#note VOW(S) instead? VOW 6E? Maybe even W(Y)VERN 13C?
>Tim_Weiss: ACMPY 5E C.AMPY +30 124
>Joshua_Sokol: EFINOTT 10A FET.TION +65 98
>Tim_Weiss: DDEILO 11G DOILED +21 145
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKLMNT A7 KNI.E +36 134
#note LI(F)TMEN is awesome. KELI(M) leaves a better leave but gives back more, and 13C M(Y) is too fishy for this board.
>Tim_Weiss: APT J2 PAT. +15 160
#note Not sure why not the other PAT(Y).
>Joshua_Sokol: EFLMNRT B9 F.RMENT +31 165
#note FL(Y)MEN is also awesome.
>Tim_Weiss: AGO B5 GOA +12 172
>Joshua_Sokol: AAILSUU J11 .UAU +6 171
#note I didn't like playing this, but it seemed like my best option.
>Tim_Weiss: ADENSW 15J SNAWED +38 210
#note It took him a long long time to play this. He judged more important to block the S hook than to block the 3x3, which I agree with, but it's hard to see the light after disaster strikes.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AGILOS 15A O.ALGIeS +131 302
>Tim_Weiss: DHU 4J .HUD +16 226
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHIJOZ N12 JIB. +26 328
#note 13I B(A)IZE I think. Maybe 14L HOB? At least this is defensive.
>Tim_Weiss: Q F14 Q. +31 257
>Joshua_Sokol: EHINORZ L8 HOR.E +26 354
#note RHINO O8! Though that gives back an X hotspot. It's hard to tell for sure if Tim didn't have the X on Q(I), but there's a pretty good chance he didn't
>Tim_Weiss: CIU 8L .UIC +27 284
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILNSZ 2H ZI.LINES +88 442
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILNSZ --  -88 354
#note Awesome! I've never played or seen this word before! Oh wait, it's two words... :(
>Tim_Weiss: TX M7 T.X +36 320
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILNSZ N2 LIS +15 369
#note Defense and setupsss. If I draw the A I'm in business, but if I draw just about anything I am.
>Tim_Weiss: AEGLOOV H1 GOLE. +27 347
#note Now he has to block for spread, but he decides not to.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEINZ O1 ZIN +40 409
>Tim_Weiss: AOV C3 AVO +15 362
#note O10 AVO. He almost made a comeback! ZIPLINES* was a big mistake, but I was so sure it was good!
>Tim_Weiss:  (EE) +4 366
#note Final score recorded as 367-409 for some reason.
