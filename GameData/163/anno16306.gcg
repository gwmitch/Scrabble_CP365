#note JOUkING.
>Ed_Liebfried: EOV 6I VOE +17 35
#note Other VOE seems better, but this should mean he has an S.

#note D11 FIG? ORST is comparable to IRST.
>Ed_Liebfried: AGR D11 GAR +17 123
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILRST D3 RETILES +69 205
#note I wonder if I just missed LEISTER here or if I decided to play more defensively.

#note PECH? C2 PEP?
>Ed_Liebfried: ASZ B10 ZAS +39 174
>Joshua_Sokol: ?CCENOP A2 CONCEP.s +64 295
#note CONCEPt(I)! Ed taught me that word after this game. I also have COP(R)iNCE available at 3A. Not a big deal or even the wrong play as this gives back so much less than COPRINCE.
>Ed_Liebfried: ES H7 ..E +10 184
>Joshua_Sokol: AENRTTW 5D .W.T +14 309
#note I know Ed's rack is strong, which is why playing 3L WATT or WAT or whatever seems wrong, and so does C2 TAW/WAT.
>Ed_Liebfried: ABEILNS M1 SIN.ABLE +74 258
#note N2 LESBIAN? I think it's a hard choice but that in times like these you takes as many points as possible, especially if you infer a consonant-heavy rack after (T)W(I)T, but maybe opening so much volatility is wise.

#note lol... such luck this game.
>Ed_Liebfried: HOO 2E OHO +29 287

#note lol...

#note And I blocked his E(N)FRAMED/FREEDMA(N)!...
2J DEA(I)R is his best move.
