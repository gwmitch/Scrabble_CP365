#note KOINE pulls ahead in the sim. Thought it would be more like neck-and-neck. Not too big an error though

#note It took me forever to see the seven in this rack. And when I spotted it, I just slapped it down with my clock getting low. Failed to realize the much better placement. Ugh, random spaz.

#note Brain was telling me to take the 109-pt lead with NOMA. But with XJ unseen and a pending bingo from Ross, 109 did not seem that huge. The chance to shut down / weaken all the bingo lines at once was super tempting. I decided not to go all the way with something like NOT, which also blockes the *(E)S bingos. Anywho, I dunno. It didn't work out.
