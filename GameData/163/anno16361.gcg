>Matthew_Larocque: CDEGNOR K7 D.COR +16 16
#note The more time I spent on this turn, the more frustrated I got because nothing stood out. Playing GOD/DOG/DOC parallel seems a lot better. This play is not good. Fishing off the G actually wins the sim.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AAFH J10 HAAF +33 105
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AADEGN L1 bANDAGE. +73 89
#note Blank draw to rescue me. Since I did not know GADARENE or ENDAMAGE, this was the best I could find.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: LOU 13J .OUL +14 119
>Matthew_Larocque: EILOORY K4 OY +23 112
#note OILER is kind of a meh leave, but scoring options are not plentiful here - 23 is the highest I can do.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EF L11 FE. +18 137
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEILOR 1K O.ELI +12 124
#note Slow crawl to see who can break 200 first. Sim is a big cluster with the higher scoring LEER M2 edging out the others, but it keeps 3 vowels....
>Siri_Tillekeratne: EINNRST 14D INTERNS +74 211
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEEORS H12 BO.E +27 151
#note Good thing I didn't keep 3 vowels last turn! This game is starting to look very grim. I forgot REBO(R)E was a word, but I think I like keeping EERS.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: AEK 13C KAE +18 229
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIPRSU N1 .EU +6 157
#note Blah. This time I just sucked, but to be fair I haven't seen this word in a very long time. I should totally play (L)IEU instead though to setup the P! N9 UPRISE performs better than the fishes, but I decided to go for the bingo with several open spots available.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: LMSU 15A SLUM +35 264
#note Was afraid of that.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIPRSU O3 PIU +10 167
#note Really? The other U? Missing RESUPI(N)E was a fatal error.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: X 7K ..X +19 283
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIORRS 6L .OR +15 182
#note Sigh.... I knew ROSARY, but not ROSERY. Like I always say, when I'm bad..... I'm REALLY bad.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: ABP 7F BAP +20 303
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIRST N8 EERIEST +76 258
#note Too late for this to matter.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IQ A13 QI. +12 315
>Matthew_Larocque: AACIOTW 6F AWA +27 285
#note AWAIT instead for turnover? Sim likes it a lot better than AWA.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IT O7 IT +12 327
>Matthew_Larocque: CIOTTVY I3 CITY +22 307
#note TIVY is obviously better, but since this was turning into a closed board crawl, I didn't want to burn too much time on each turn. CITY seemed like a good play when I saw it.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: IJN C10 JIN. +15 342
>Matthew_Larocque: ?GNSTVZ 11B Z.GS +28 335
#note Seriously? I didn't play Z(I)NG? That's kind of hard to believe. Z(I)G/Z(I)N isn't going to work either, too many letters can block. However, I overlooked keeping the G for 5K. That would have been helpful.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: HM G13 H.M +25 367
#note Crap. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NORTVW M9 WO +20 355
#note TW(A) leaves ReNVO(I), but I'm not clever enough to see that. It can actually win too, if Siri makes the same play he does next turn.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DILORV E9 VI. +6 373
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NRTV 4F NeV. +10 365
#note I should play R(A)T(E) now instead of later.
>Siri_Tillekeratne: DLOR 3E ROD +12 385
>Matthew_Larocque: RT 2K R.T. +8 373
#note Lucky Siri doesn't block my out.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (L) +2 375
#note It's amazing that I got as close as I did, that game was complete ass.
