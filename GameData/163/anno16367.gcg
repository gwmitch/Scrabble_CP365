>Dave_Koenig: BEGGLSU 11E BULGES +31 63
#note Not a bad play, but I missed the nice GLUG 7G, which not only scores well but also sets up an additional hook for my S.  There's not much of a difference between my play and BUGLES in the same spot, but I chose this one because the G is a bit less flexible for plays down to H15.

>Dave_Koenig: AACGLMU H11 .ULAG +24 87
#note This is Quackle's second favorite play after 7E CAGMAG#, which I did not know.

>Dave_Koenig: ACFLMNO 15A CONF +48 135
#note Best.
>Sammy_Okosagah: EINNRT 15J TINNER +25 151
#note An instructive play from Sammy.  Without a lot of bingo lanes and with both blanks still unseen, he doesn't sacrifice points to hang onto good tiles.  Instead, he turns over as much as he can and takes out the best scoring spot on the board.
>Dave_Koenig: AAELMPR 13H .AMPER +35 170
>Dave_Koenig: AAEELRT (challenge) +5 175
#note Definitely the best play, and I was quite pleased to see Sammy challenge it and give me an extra 5 points.  LAMPERS does not lose the S in TWL.
>Sammy_Okosagah: UY 12L YU +22 173
#note I think Sammy was exactly right to play this in this spot rather than at 14N, because the other play would leave bigger scores open to me at 12L-O.
>Dave_Koenig: AAEELRT 13B EA +14 189
#note LAETARE# does not play here, and instead I have an interesting choice.  I also have the fish EA at 13B, but in comparison that gives him an easy lane which he is likely to take first.  This move, on the other hand, sets up both my L and T when there is a better chance he may not have a hook tile for column A.  It turns out the only hook tile he had was the blank.

>Dave_Koenig: AEJNNOT E5 JE.N +22 332
#note I have to confess to being utterly clueless about Quackle's simulation results in this position.  To me, my move is screaming to be played, because it's the one thing that naturally plays off the J and duplicate N, when I have a very good chance of drawing into a bingo next turn.  For some reason, Quackle thinks the best play for winning percentage is the bizarre JATO K4, which makes very little sense to me, as it keeps duplicate N's, gives him scores off the J, and doesn't even particularly block that many bingo lines.  No matter what I play, Quackle thinks I'm at best about a 40-60 underdog to win here, as Sammy has tempo and a really fantastic pool of tiles from my point of view.

>Dave_Koenig: ?ABINOT N6 OBTAINs +67 399
#note I was completely at a loss about what to do here, even though I had plenty of time to think it out.  The problem is that even though I can bingo many ways, I am looking at a dynamite tile pool for him, and it's very likely he will bingo back to beat me, particularly if I play my high scoring bingo of OBTAINER, giving him the easy N column for D, S, or T ending bingos.  With the blank in hand it seems natural to delay bingoing and try to bingo out.  But most intermediate plays are going to leave me still trailing a little bit, and if I only play off a couple of tiles, I invite him to do the same thing back to me.  Also, I was a bit worried that if I didn't bingo and didn't score enough to catch up, he might bingo himself from O8, and then my bingos might not score enough to catch up.

From what I can tell of Championship Player's analysis, the most important thing is to play four tiles here, so as to force him to be the one who empties the bag.  It thinks 11L OBIA is my best play.  It was psychologically difficult for me to break up a bingo rack that substantially, but I should have faith with the pool that I'm looking into that I will very likely get a great draw.  (Or if by some very unlikely chance, I just happen to get a bad draw, then Sammy would have to have one as well.)

Instead I started worrying, "what if he didn't quite hit a bingo draw and I end up just giving him an extra turn to clean up the rack?"  So I tried to find the way to bingo to minimize the chance that he could fit a return bingo.  In retrospect I didn't do that very well.  It would have been better to bingo on row 3 myself, because if the S is in the bag, then there actually is a chance his bingos might not fit.

#note Surprisingly to me, Sammy rushed this and took a low scoring bingo instead of finding TARDIES or ASTRIDE on the O column, but any bingo is enough to win here.

With Sammy's actual rack, if I had played OBIA, Quackle recommends 3E DIASTER for him.  Then drawing four from ADDIE, if I had left the E or I in the bag I would lose, but otherwise I would win.
