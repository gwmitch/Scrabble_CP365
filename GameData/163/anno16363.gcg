>Siddharth_Murali: ?EELNRS D4 RENE.aLS +70 70
#note I didn't think of hooking WHALER. Instead, I pretty much open up four quadrants of the board with a lead. :/
>Tasha_Asberry: GILY 10B GI.LY +21 51
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEIOPX E4 EX +38 108
#note A few plays are close here. I don't like APEX that much but HELIX is beautiful. Should have seen it. This comes behind those two.
>Tasha_Asberry: BEM F6 BE.M. +18 69
>Siddharth_Murali: AADIOOP C3 PODIA +37 145

>Tasha_Asberry: GT 2F G.T +8 82
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADEIOO E10 .OO +10 183
#note Only LOOIE sims better. I still like this.
>Tasha_Asberry: CEFLT 13B CLEFT +27 109
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ADDEIO 1H ADEnOID +83 266
#note For some reason, I thought that this was one of those 'only seven' racks like ?AEIORT or something. I didn't even care to look harder! ... pathetic
>Tasha_Asberry: IJNRRSS O1 SRI +36 145
#note Phew, I could have been much harder. She said she left JRNS here.
>Siddharth_Murali: ADENOTW 2J DOWNE. +49 315
#note At least I found this :/
>Tasha_Asberry: JOY B2 JOY +37 182
>Siddharth_Murali: AIMNTTU H4 MAT +22 337
#note Sims right up there with some low scoring dump/fishing plays such as (IN)TUIT or (nO)TUM or MUT. I'm fine with this. 
>Tasha_Asberry: INSZ 4L ZINS +33 215
>Siddharth_Murali: AHINOTU 5J UTA +17 354
#note 11th on SP, but sims best because it sets up my H nicely. Most of the other plays, such as (G)UA(C)HO, are a bit too reckless and keep bingoey leaves on a non-bingoey board.
>Tasha_Asberry: ANOV I10 NOVA +10 225
>Siddharth_Murali: HINORRT 6J HO +28 382
#note Taking the points here. Why would i sac 22 to keep INORT or sac 9 to keep INRT, quackle?
>Tasha_Asberry: ABK H13 KAB +33 258
>Siddharth_Murali: EIINRRT L4 ..NIER +22 404
#note Opens a lane, but what are my options? Definitely not a fan of fishing here. Maybe (B)RINIER?
>Tasha_Asberry: PRSV 8K P.RVS +30 288
>Siddharth_Murali: GIIRRTT 15H .RITT +8 412
#note My best out sequence, according to CP.
>Tasha_Asberry: EEFINU 12I .ENUE +16 304
>Siddharth_Murali: GIR B7 GRI. +10 422
#note Missed RIG. I played overall alright this game, but mistakes like ADENOID really hurt, and I kind of lucked out with such a huge error there. The rest of my plays were good, but ADENOID was REALLY bad! Maybe I shouldn't have won.
