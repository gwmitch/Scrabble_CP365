>Quackle: AEIIRRS 8G RAI +6 6
>Mack: CELOPUW J7 PLOW +21 21
#note I7 POW is definitely a viable choice, but I preferred this for defensive purposes.
>Quackle: ?EEHIRS 11E HEIRESs +96 102
>Mack: CEELNOU 12A OUNCE +21 42
#note This and H11 ROUEN sim neck and neck.
>Quackle: ?BBEFIT F6 FIB +23 125
>Mack: EEFHLOR A10 HO.FER +36 78
>Quackle: ?ABERTZ H10 B.AZER +54 179
#note This is an interesting choice for Quackle: Quackle opted to eschew 7H BAPTiZER, which scores 34 more.  I suppose this sacrifice is warranted by the fact that a 100 point lead with a blank on a board with no huge scoring spots is fairly decisive, whereas if I get a 3*3, which is not too unlikely, it is an even game.
>Mack: AACELNS I13 AL +17 95
#note Oops, I missed ANLACES here.
>Quackle: ?INPTUV I5 PTU. +12 191
>Mack: ACEJNOS E1 CAJONES +89 184
#note An undeserved but much needed pickup after the bingo miss.
>Quackle: ?DIINTV 2D V.NITIeD +63 254
>Mack: ADINRTT 13G T..RINA +34 218
>Quackle: LLNORTY 3I TROLLY +27 281
>Mack: ADDEGIT 1E .ITED +38 256
#note Although numerous plays retain better leaves, I felt this was too many points to pass up.
>Quackle: AEEMNOS C7 ANEMO.ES +74 355
#note It's starting to look grim now, but...
>Mack: ADEGIMX 8A MI.X +63 319
#note he opens up a much needed 60 point spot for my X.
>Quackle: AEIOQSW D4 WO +22 377
>Mack: ADEEGGT 15H .ETAGGED +92 411
#note Another lucky draw keeps this game alive...
>Quackle: AEINQSU N8 QUEANS +34 411
#note Strangely enough, this apparently wins only 86% of the time but N3 YANQUIS wins 100%. But as it turns out, I would have answered YANQUIS with 12L OKAY, earning a 451-444 victory. 
>Mack: ADGKOUY M2 K.UDGY +19 430
#note Fortunately, I don't have to worry about 8N QI coming down since Quackle will be V-stuck after that play and I can win easily. I saw plays like 5I PADOUK and 12K KOAN, but these both lose to N1 IVY; I also found 5G YAPOK, which results in a 439-439 tie after IVY. I knew the only way to win would be a play that blocks IVY, for his next best out is A6 VIM, which scores 10 less than IVY. Although KLUDGY accomplishes the goal of blocking IVY, it does give back VID for only 4 less; however, VID is just barely insufficient for Quackle to achieve a tie or win.
