#note he knew HALERU didn't take an S but now i have to block AHS just in case he sees it next turn and take a big equity hit. this and NAH are the only ways to block.
>stu: AEOPQSU L3 OPAQUE. +38 70
#note although now i made QUELEA worth more. so is NAH better?

>stu: OW 12D WO +19 89
>cesar: ACEEGIP 13C PEG +28 104
#note i spent several minutes evaluating GIP M5 vs PEG until i made the choice mostly on leave and blocking his obvious opening. i think GIP is good if he misses his bingo as it uglifies a scoring spot a little. (-0.5)
>stu: ?AEEISS 14E SEASIdE +70 159
>cesar: AACEEIR 13I AERIE +18 122
#note gah. i missed M1 CERIA. i saw it at 7D and didn't think it scored enough to warrant blocking a (weakish) bingo lane and keep two vowels. (although, it's still better than AERIE). i think this is a pretty hard move and i actually thought i had made the right one, but M1 CERIA just scores enough, blocks some scoring spots, doesn't give THAT much back a lot of the time, and can distract him a bit and leave another triple open for me. (-8)

#note eh :/ quackle likes 14A VIA or M2 VIA. i just don't like that at all. i don't think that's right. am i wrong? (-11)

>cesar: ?AAAENT 7A ANATAsE +64 257
#note his score next turn is large with anatase, and ANTA 12L sims better than bingoing. i'm not a fan, after STOLE especially. stu has a pretty risk-averse style it seems, and he is very likely to block the last bingo lane even if he has to sacrifice a lot of equity. what do you guys think? (-6)
>stu: EIKNRT A4 KER.TIN +48 308
>cesar: HILMSVX 12L HM +28 285
#note i spent a while debating this vs SHIV at the same spot. i think i really need the S to ensure i score with the X. is it ok to give up the 11 points now? (-5)
>stu: DNRTU C2 TUNDR. +14 322
>cesar: ILORSVX E4 VOL.R +16 301
#note it seems like i made the correct pre-endgame play! VOILA could also be pretty good. i only had about 3 minutes left at this point and am happy i came up with the best chance i could to win.
>stu: BRT 7J BR.T +12 334
>cesar: BIIOSUX 14A OBI +14 315
#note this ensures the win but 2B UT sims better, he has no V spot so i can slow play him. (-12)
