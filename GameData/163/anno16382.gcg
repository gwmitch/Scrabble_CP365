>Computer: AGINSTW 8D WASTING +80 80
>Trip: AEOOSTV 7B AVO +15 15
#note Lots of choices within a few points of each other.  
>Computer: TUX 6D TUX +32 112
>Trip: ?EORSTU 5F ESTROUs +71 86
#note Not much difference among the bingos here, aside from not providing an end hook and not putting an S at 5H.
>Computer: FI 6A IF +26 138
>Trip: DEMORUY 8A MY +30 116
#note Funny that the two best moves are YOU at E4 and MY at 8A.
>Computer: AEIRRST L2 TAR.IERS +66 204
>Trip: BDEHORU H1 DROU.H +33 149
#note Missed both DOUBT H1 and HOTBED 2J.  Would have played DOUBT.
>Computer: DO 5B OD +13 217
>Trip: BEEHILY 4D YEH +31 180
#note Saw HEH 6H but the Y is a liability on this particular board.  Thought about HEY 6H possibly followed by an H play using either 4F or M9 but it seemed more urgent to get the rack as bingo-prone as possible quickly.
>Computer: AAEGNST 2B TANAGE.S +76 293
#note Luckily missing MAGNATES and MAGENTAS at 1H.
>Trip: BCEEILM H8 .MBECILE +101 281
#note Well, that was lucky.
>Computer: IILV 14F VI.LI +18 311
>Trip: ADDKNPZ 1A ZAP +48 329
#note Ooh, ZADDIK J10, that's nice.  ZAP is yet another second-best-play in a game that is filled with them.

>Computer: ?AAACER 12B CARApA.E +72 420
#note Oh sure, bingo AND block my 42-point Q drop.  Thanks for nothing, Ron.
>Trip: IILLQTW E11 Q.T +24 431
#note Spent a little while debating here.  Considered WILLIE N10 but that could lead to Ron playing BONER or BOP or something on row 11, me being forced to drop QI for 11, and getting outrun.
>Computer: EENOOPR 13J REOPEN +20 440
>Trip: BEIILLW 6H .EW +32 463
#note Only appropriate to end with yet one more second-best play.  I had about 12 minutes on my clock so recounted the whole game and quintuple-checked his outplay options to make sure of the one-point win ... only to miss BEWAIL C9, which scores less but wins by more.
