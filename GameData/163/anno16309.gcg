>Joshua_Sokol: ?BCHRTV 12B V.TCH +26 201
#note Scored as 28 even though I knew this scored 26 from my last game against Jeanmarie.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: GNOP 11J PONG +22 181
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ABDORT 13F ABORTeD +68 269
#note Luckily she didn't play the other PONG for 22 down column K.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: JO 14F JO +58 239
#note I was afraid of this... 
>Joshua_Sokol: EEEIIUZ L11 .U.IE +14 283
#note Maybe I should just play (HAJ)I, but that could be me being results-oriented...
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: IIPT 15E TIPI +39 278
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILUZ B12 .AU +14 297
#note B10 UL(V)A instead? 
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: EEF 5D FEE +15 293
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILSTZ D3 EL. +12 309
#note I'm not sure why I played EL(F). I know I was setting up a spot for my S but I think 4B ZEE is much better.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: EEW C2 EWE +24 317
>Joshua_Sokol: EIOSTTZ E8 .ZOI. +32 341
#note I must have been fishing for this. lol
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: ILV 15L .VIL +21 338
>Joshua_Sokol: DESTT 2B T.D +16 357
#note I didn't write down my rack here, which sucks cause it's a pretty pivotal moment of the game. I think this is good cause it cuts some of her scoring by a lot and kept a good leave.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: OY 12H YO +20 358
#note 5N OY. I was really scared she had the last A and that she could score a ton with F8 (N)AY.
>Joshua_Sokol: CENORST N8 RECS +20 377
#note Turns out, the A was in the bag, how lucky. So here I see the score as 359-358 me and I think I spot a win by two. I took a very long time to look and thought this won. N9 REST, N11 SENT(I), N12 CON(I), N9 ERST/NEST and 9J (U)NTO are my wins.
>Jeanmarie_Youngblood: AEFIST 8L FI.E +33 391
#note Unfortunately, we recounted and V(E)TCH was overscored by 2, so instead of a pretty important win I tied. I was kind of upset.
>Joshua_Sokol: NOT B4 TON +8 385
>Joshua_Sokol:  (AST) +6 391
#note Since my spread was the best in the whole division, getting a tie was really not what I wanted.
