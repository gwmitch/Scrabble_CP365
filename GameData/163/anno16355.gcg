#note I straight up whiffed ENERVATE after he blocked my two bing lines.... I saw it TO the E, just not FROM his E. 

Also why don't I know words?

#note And finally I freak out about the hook and decide I need to block it. In a close game, I figure my odds of winning after blocking are fairly close to 50/50. I didn't know how to handle this and it really messed with me.

#note My chances just took a big hit. I don't see CNIDAE, and I figure now I have to start gambling and draw a bingo that starts with S for 10F. 

A(ID) for 4?

#note I played the second half of this game really poorly. The ENERVATE spot r eally messed with me and I know I'm extremely prone to snowballing- when I know I've played a few turns poorly I play all the rest of the turns poorly.
