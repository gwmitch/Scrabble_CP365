#note Was happy to take this over SWIGS, though I neglected that SWIGS blocks QI which seems like a small advantage. Still am okay with this play though.

#note QI was very tempting and this decision was difficult. If he has the B this works out very poorly. Also the longer I spend on this play the more likely it is that I have the Q I think.

#note It seemed like I could lose to other stuff if I blocked RENOVATE, so I went with a play that seemed to win as long as opp didn't have RENOVATE.
