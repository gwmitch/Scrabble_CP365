#note Whoa, stop for a second! I want you to do me a favor as you play through this game, and actually try to play through it. Don't just flip through the moves until you get to the awesome one. I want you to share in the awesomeness. ***Try to find it yourself!*** 
>Jesse: AEORSTX H3 EXTRA.OS +74 74
#note Then! Keep track of how many you've found. If you've found more than everybody else at the end, then you win a year's supply of Cyberspace Kudo Units.

#note Setting up the H. Quackle prefers playing off the H immediately. (-4)
>Jesse: I I3 .I +20 114
>Carl: AADGHKS 7C DAK +21 134
#note Nearly all of Quackle's recommended plays burn the H. The only exception is SKAG C8, setting up the H in two places. It's not particularly useful to block bingo lanes at this score; I can't kill them all, and if he hits something, he'll often be able to control the board.
>Jesse: ACD 9C CAD +23 137
#note Jesse is the master of suspense. I had seen the possibility of HIJACKINGS E2 if Jesse put an N at 9E. Jesse slowly laid his tiles down, and the D fell upside down when he placed it. My heartbeat was audible in the second or two until he flipped it over. As it turns out, HIJACKINGS# is Collins and would have been challenged off. CARJACKINGS and SKYJACKINGS are in the American wordlist.
>Carl: ACGHIJS 8J HAJ +31 165
#note HAJ 7G wins the sim.(-5) I think my reasoning here was that CIG M7 kills the board if he can't bingo next turn.
>Jesse: EIL M7 LIE +19 156
>Carl: CGIOOSZ L1 ZI.G +48 213
#note GONZO sims slightly ahead. (-1.5) ZING may be better than the sim since Jesse seems to be on a bingo draw, and is not especially likely to bingo through the Z

>Carl: ACDERSY N1 DESCRY +74 336
#note Bam! You have just witnessed 74 points of pure, dazzling style! This is the stuff that Lady Gaga daydreams about in that scrumptious meat suit. DESCRY: #13 on Carl Johnson's 2013 Awesome Play Countdown. Eternized here for your entertainment.

#note I was all set to play POOPED C3. SIR is a horror story as scary as my draw. Not only does it block my scoring play, I can't block row A or B. Best I can do is blast the board wide open and hope for the best.
