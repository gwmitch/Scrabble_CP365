#note Sim likes HEW better, but there's no S spots open on this board, so I didn't see a need to keep both. 11J SWIG is also a consideration.

#note Quackle is dying to get me to play UNHAIRERS, but since I have the last S, I'm waiting to cash it there until it's hopeless to bingo.

#note Aside from UNHAIRERS, there's not much I can do with this rack, and it's not going to get me any further after I play the S. I need to exchange now or never.

#note I think enough times out of the 9 tiles left I will win. Sim says this wins about 67% of the time due to responses like WRANGLE, but with two Os left, I think I have good odds. Maybe I thought this out wrong and it's not worth the risk? But then again, how will I block both the R lane on the left and the L lane on the top?
