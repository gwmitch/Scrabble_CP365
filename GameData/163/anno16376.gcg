>Carl: ADEFKNR 8H FRANKED +90 90
#note A very lucky game from Oregon Tile, May 2013. Opponent is Mark Milan.
>Mark: DHO 9M HOD +23 23
>Carl: EIIOOTW 10N WO +31 121
#note I did see TWOONIE, but Mark spent a long time on HOD, and  I got the read from him that he was close to a bingo. I figured him (wrongly) for an S or a blank. TOWIE 7E might be correct.
>Mark: AEINRTV I3 VERAT.IN +67 90
>Carl: EIIIOQT 5G TO.II +10 131
#note Psych! Awesome plays don't need to score big. TORII unloads the junk and sets up QI for 33 at F6 and K4! "What the devil is a TORII?", you may well be wondering. Truthfully, you've probably seen one before. Do a Google image search. Ohhh, it's one of those.
>Mark: NTTY 4H N.TTY +25 115
#note I just love the symmetry in TORII, setting up two equal-scoring spots for QI, another word of Asian lineage. It's hard to get worked up over a 10-point play, but this one is aesthetically beautiful, and rather an unorthodox play from a rack that some might automatically exchange.

#note Wrong-- with 3 Ss unseen, I should take the 10 points for SEX J12. (-5)
>Mark: TV 14G V..T +16 257
>Carl: ACEHMRS B1 SCHMEAR +88 464
#note Quackle says this wins .02% less often than ARCHES 15J. I'm playin' with fire.
>Mark: EM C3 ME +26 283
>Carl: AAASUUW -AAUUW +0 464
#note Quackle keeps the W here, perhaps because of the possibility of ASSWAgED, or just as a scoring tile at A6 or D4. (-2)
>Mark: BDENS A6 BENDS +32 315
>Carl: ADLOPRS 4B ..L +10 474
#note I was just going for spread at this point, hoping to draw the I or the blank. I noticed that Mark probably did not keep the I or blank after BENDS, and he was reasonably likely to have kept the other S, which increases my chances of hitting my draw.
