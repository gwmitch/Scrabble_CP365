#note I can score 3 more with FET 6F, but I felt some compelling need to shut off the QUAI spot. I don't know why I'm opening important, hard-to-block S spots on this board, but I do know that I'm probably faking him out with this play by making him think I'm setting myself up.

#note Got a little ahead of myself with the TLS-DWS, HEAT or HEAP are obvious underlap plays that are better defensively.

#note I deserve this. 
>Matt_Canik: IILPRTT 5L TRIP +15 241
#note Too scared of the S spot to leave this open.

#note I had completely forgotten this took a front A. I held this for a little, mostly out of surprise, but the word looked familiar to me when he played it. 
>Matt_Canik: EILMRRT L10 M.RL +12 277
#note I spent forever on this turn. I didn't want to play this, give up a 30-point play along 3, and then have a tie game with two blanks unseen to me. At the same time, a play like MI(L)LER opens up the top-left part of the board in such a way that it's almost inevitable that he'll eventually bingo. I don't want that.

#note I think I pretty much win now barring an -IS(E) bingo along 15. He said I blocked SIDEWAy with this.

#note I'm about 99% sure that WILE doesn't take any front hooks in TWL. I spent a really long time deliberating whether I should let that 1% of doubt cost me a lot of spread by making a stupid blocking play like (W)IZ or (W)IT. Elected to go with my gut on word knowledge, something I think I need to teach myself to do more (see round 13). 

Quackle's highest-valued play here is the ridiculously counterintuitive TIE D1.

>Geoff_Thevenot: ?ADEOSS --  -77 310
#note My heart dropped a little when he set this down, since Geoff is so good at words, but a huge wave of relief as the screen was red. DWILE is collins-only.
