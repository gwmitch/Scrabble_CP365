>Joshua_Sokol: CEHLNOR E4 CHOR. +20 20
#note E5 ECH(E)LON is a bad miss. Also, why didn't I play CHOR(D) over CHOR(E)?
>John_Scalzo: IQS J6 QIS +42 64
>Joshua_Sokol: CELNRVZ 6C CL.ZE +36 56
#note C(O)Z instead? Probably. Also, C(O)ZEN over CL(O)ZE because LRV is better than NRV.

#note 9C P(A)D even though the leave is hideous.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?EELRTU 4B T.U.E +14 140
#note I wrote down UNDERLET on my scoresheet. I must have chickened out. I also missed TU(N)nELER, U(R)ETERaL (which I didn't know) and another new one, mU(R)RELET. The first two are inexcusable.
>John_Scalzo: ?AEENOT 11F EA.sTONE +64 229
#note I think he missed F8 (B)ENzOATE.

#note Damn...
>Joshua_Sokol: AILNRST N5 RATLINS +69 367
#note Clutch S draw! Still doesn't look good for me. Quackle thinks John won't block if I fish here. Please... I have to play the bingo. There is no miracle fish here.
>John_Scalzo: AABGJSU F10 J.A.S +30 398
#note I thought I had the win, and John did too, until he found this! this and J(E)A(N) are his only wins. I couldn't get the best of him this time!

#note I made some rather large mistakes, so this loss was easily preventable. Good game though!
