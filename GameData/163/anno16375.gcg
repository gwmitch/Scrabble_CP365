>Scott_Garner: FIZ 8G FIZ +30 30
>Siddharth_Murali: AFNPRRS 9H FAR +24 24
>Scott_Garner: BEILOO K7 BLOOIE +23 53
#note Maybe an attempt to open up all areas of the board against me? Other placements do the same thing and are more defensive.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EHNPRS 11E SERaPH.N +74 98
#note I didn't know any of the better bingos. iNSPHERE, eNSPHERE, and uNSPHERE for 82 a row down look good. (uNSPHERE obviously the best of the three). I don't think I knew PHRENSy either. PE(O)N also sims better than my play.
>Scott_Garner: AMRUU 10B AURUM +27 80
>Siddharth_Murali: ABDGINY C9 B.YING +30 128
#note Should I play this or (L)YING? This is about an 8 point equity loss, but it's awesome defense.
>Scott_Garner: ADEIRTU 13B I.DURATE +61 141
>Siddharth_Murali: AADETVX H13 .AX +30 158
#note Same story here. This is 1.0 off of the best equity play (L)ATEX, but obviously is going to give back less per turn. I'm convinced TAX is better, but thoughts?
>Scott_Garner: DIV 7F VID +21 162
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEIOTV D3 DEVIATO. +80 238
>Scott_Garner: EEGL L4 GLEE +14 176
#note He spent enormously long on this play. I was kind of puzzled because at the time it didn't seem to open much up (You'll see later).
>Siddharth_Murali: AEELNOQ 12B Q. +22 260
#note (G)ONE, Q(I), and (US)Q(U)E are close. AEELNO isn't bad enough to the point where I wouldn't just play QI.
>Scott_Garner: EKL M7 LEK +19 195
>Siddharth_Murali: AEELNOS 5D .OE +12 272
#note The choke begins. I don't know where to start. So yeah, the reason GLEE looked weird is because I flat out missed AGLEE. This is still the clear cut second best (also considered LEONES which sims much worse), but 'second best' hurts here. Big time.
>Scott_Garner: AJMOR 3I JORAM +50 245
#note I held this play, even though I knew AGLEE, just in shock that I flat out missed an opportunity to put the game away. *facepalm*. Instead of being up 138, I'm up by 27.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEHLNOS 2J HO +28 300
#note I was still pretty upset about the last play (and about having homeless ENHALOS) that I flat out missed E(N)HALO for 32. I was also very low on time, but there is just no excuse. I go on streaks where I control the board very well, and then start playing like an equity machine on plays which it's unwarranted. 
>Scott_Garner: ANOTY 1H ATONY +45 290
>Siddharth_Murali: AAELNST J11 .A +7 307
#note I told Scott I absolutely didn't want to fish here, but I thought I had to, and I would hate playing something like ASEA. I missed ASLANT for 37 though, which sims right in the middle of the jumble of fishing plays. I like ASLANT even though there are two esses and a blank unseen, because if I fish and bingo, he gets an easy S lane anyways.
>Scott_Garner: IPT C2 TIP +20 310
>Siddharth_Murali: AELNRST N9 ANTLERS +74 381
#note I think this is clearly better than SALTERN or ASTERNAL. Setting up just one scoring spot instead of two is just bad.
>Scott_Garner: ?DEEITW O3 DEWIEsT +90 400
#note Yeah, I'm in huge trouble here.
>Siddharth_Murali: CEINNUW 15J UNWI.E +39 420
#note This play is second best to ENOLASE/AGLEE.
>Scott_Garner: CGOSS E4 C.S +14 414
#note He didn't realize that this gave me a place to play my C. HE just needs to play PES/SO in the same spot, and play one tile at a time. He lost 15 points on this endgame, so I feel just slightly better.
>Siddharth_Murali: CN 6C C.. +5 425
>Scott_Garner: GOS G3 GOS +13 427
#note Well played to Scott, nice comeback, and a deserving win.
>Scott_Garner:  (N) +2 429
