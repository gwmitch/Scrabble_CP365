#note I spent a long time thinking here, because my choice is very unobvious#.  I don't have anything very high scoring, and pretty much all of my plays that score in the 20s break up the rack more than I would like.  After some thought, I decided that it was right to fish off some consonants to leave myself the best bingo shot possible.  By setting up the CLEGS hook to the double word score, I tried to assure myself a good backup scoring play if I should happen to pull a heavy tile that stopped me from bingoing.  Quackle is not crazy about CLEG, but it definitely agrees with my strategy of playing a low scoring fish here.  Its favorite play is GILD F11, because the CORS leave is stronger than the DORS one.  It likes that even more than playing GELD 4I for 2 more points because keeping the E open increases my bingo chances even more.

#note I have many other bingos here, but I'm glad that I remembered this one, which is by far the highest scoring.

#note Before his play, I was looking to dump more consonants, perhaps with FORBID or BOVID on row 6, but I thought he might have been setting up a spot for QAT in two directions.  Even if not, the L12 spot is one of the higher scoring ones on the board, so it is worth taking out.

>Dave_Koenig: ADGNPRV 5D GRAV. +18 290
#note Perhaps PARVO B11 to take out column A and the Z spot at 14B, but there is also value to taking out the row 6 lane. (TRUCE takes D and S.)

>Chris_Lipe: QTU F10 QU.T +33 270
#note He clearly had no A or I on his rack, as QUIT or QUAT# would have played quite nicely at 4C and also set up a useful S hook on column B.  In fact, he would see only one I and no A's for the rest of the game, while getting bombarded with O's.

#note I'm still struggling with a lot of consonants here, but this scores enough more than the alternatives to be worth it.

#note Ha, Quackle outdoes me once again.  I was quite happy with my bingo, which scored enough to outdistance any bingos from him.  Also, I had mistracked his O for an E and thought he had FEISTIER on row 2.  But I had an even better bingo of HANDGRIP D1, which would have simultaneously taken out the top two rows and row 7 where FINITES or NIFTIES could have played.  In a closer game, that could have made a big difference.  Moreover, I'm sure that Nigel Richards would have played HANDGRIP.  I'll have to work harder.
