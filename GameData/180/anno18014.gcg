#player2 Jason Jason
>Chris: AAIKLOV 8D KOALA +28 28
#note So the pairings for this round got changed because they accidentally Gibsonized Matthew too soon and I have to play Jason again (remember I'd still never beaten him live) Q likes VOILA > KOALA > KIVA >VAKIL > VIOLA. Is VOILA really that much better than VIOLA? (it is better, I agree)
>Jason: CERW D4 WREC. +28 28
>Chris: EHHIQTU F6 QU.I +33 61
#note Keeping the QU with something like HEH or HEATH isn't worth it. This sims best.
>Jason: EFILR 10F LIFER +28 56
>Chris: EHHIOTT 9I HOT +21 82
#note Missed HITHERTO J5 here :( I liked this better than HETH in the same spot though. Maybe HET to set up HETH instead is better.
>Jason: CITY 11J CITY +23 79
>Chris: AEGHIOT 12L OATH +31 113
#note I can't decide if I like this or EIGHT K8 better. This kind of opens 2 spots, so the bad defense is mitigated I suppose, and the G i'm leaving goes with both of them.
>Jason: INOR O11 R.INO +24 103
>Chris: AEEGITZ 14J ZEATI. +70 183
#note I'm a luckbox, but against Jason? This isn't suppose to be the way it goes down hehe
>Jason: ABIO 15G OBIA +29 132
>Chris: ADEGPRS 14A GRASPED +79 262
#note Gave me a spot and everything. He's such a nice guy :)
>Jason: GUV A12 VU.G +39 171
>Chris: DJNSTTV C13 T.J +20 282
#note Should I just exchange here instead?
>Jason: IX 15L XI +36 207
>Chris: DGLNSTV -DGLNTV +0 282
#note I went for maximum turnover to go for the blanks, but I guess I should still keep ST here.
>Jason: DEO E3 DOE +17 224
>Chris: ?ABDRSW 11C WABS +33 315
#note Thought about BRAWS , but I wanted to keep my R and also open another easy line for my blank. I guess BAWDS is probably slightly better but equity isn't hugely important here, so I don't mind my play.
>Jason: NOY F2 YON +23 247
>Chris: ?DEIRSS L3 DeSIRES +73 388
#note There was a category for best HEART word. I submitted HOTS/DESIRES for it before being told that it was actually for the best word containing all the letters in HEART. Oops lol :P
>Jason: ?EEFLNN B5 FENNELs +72 319
#note So smart to open the second lane hehe (I still think it was a good idea) Scored as 71.
>Chris: AEEGNOP A1 PEAGE +35 423
#note GENOA A4 is better
>Jason: MU A8 UM +22 341
>Chris: ILNNOTV G1 VOLT +25 448
#note I found the best endgame play by 5 points. Keeping INN B1 and setting it up with VOLTI as well.
>Jason: ADEEMRU K4 DAME +26 367
#note -7 to EDEMA K3
>Chris: INN B1 INN +16 464
#note Finally beat Jason live! I'm pretty happy with how I played this despite the missed bingo, although the decisions weren't overly difficult most of the time.
>Chris:  (ERU) +6 470
#note Final score recorded as 467-365.
