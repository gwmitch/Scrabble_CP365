>El_Pato: CDEHPQR -PQ +0 0
>Geoff: ACENNSZ 8G NAZE +26 26
#note Vs. exchange 2, hmm. I briefly thought about CAZ#, and now it seems obviously right. Play some D! (Even without inferences, CAZ beats NAZE by 3 or so.) Probably overestimating my chances of bingoing back after drawing to CNS.
>El_Pato: CDEHRRS H3 CHRES.RD +68 68
>Geoff: ACENOST K6 COSTEAN +82 108
#note Oh sloppy. 11F scores 1 more, and I didn't add it up. Though my play actually sims better. The board is a little harder to use after K6 COSTEAN# (obscured row 5 2x2 lane, limits S-hook placement on CHRESARD...)
>El_Pato: FNNQRUX 10J F.RN +15 83
>Geoff: ?AEOOST M7 OzO.ATES +68 176
#note Somehow didn't see TOHEROAS#, which I'd have preferred. N9 OSTEOMA is more open than I want to be at this score. Briefly thought about fishing; 9G ORA doesn't do that badly. TOHEROAS sims best, about 2 better than my play.
>El_Pato: EMNQUXY N9 MY +38 121
>Geoff: AEILOUV 4F VI.UELA +26 202
#note Cleans out rack, uglies the board a little, I like it. 14I AVULSE 34 is a point back or so.
>El_Pato: EGNQUXY 6F QU.Y +36 157
>Geoff: AGIIJOR 12I JA.I.OR +30 232
#note Went between this, 3L JIG, and N4 GOJI#. Quack disagrees with my choice - I might have gotten a bit swayed by the cuteness factor and putting the blocky J out. GOJI# blocks the N and O columns, which is more important.
>El_Pato: EEGHNPX 14J PHE.E +32 189
>Geoff: AGGILTW 15F WIGGA +34 266
#note Easy call there.
>El_Pato: GNNOTTX N12 .X.N +20 209
>Geoff: ?DEILOT N1 TOLuIDE +74 340
#note Ach, wasn't sure of PHESED#. TRODE there keeping the blank would have attracted me. pILOTED or dELTOID do a bit better than what I did; the extra 3 points aren't worth forgoing the better defense...yep, TRODE does better than anything, though. Crap. 10-point mistake, maybe.
>El_Pato: BGINOTT O1 OBIT +35 244
>Geoff: AADEEEF G8 .EAFE +15 355
#note Just wanted to plow through the rack and make the board a little harder (though this does give up F column 30-pointers, I'm not much worried about that). 9H RAFT 29 is cute, and why not keep scoring...didn't look in there enough.
>El_Pato: AGINPRT F10 PING +32 276
>Geoff: ADDEIKU E11 DAUD +32 387
#note Scores fine, kills the spot. Thought of KEA; yeah, I guess 8 points is worth the leave difference here. But I like keeping two vowels/one consonant, given the pool.
>El_Pato: AELORRT D14 OR +6 282
>Geoff: BEIKSUV C12 VIBE +26 413
#note And thanks for playing.

>Geoff: IMOSW 8A MISO +28 458
#note Endgame was 3 points below optimal, says the duck.
