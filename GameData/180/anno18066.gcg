#note I missed RUNNIEST which is first of all terrible, but once I thought about it more, I stand by my play. RUNNIEST just seems too volatile, keeping the S hook open, opening an S as a floater, keeping multiple x4's open, etc. While variance shouldn't be a factor at a tie game minus tempo, I felt like the immediate defense made up for the 3 points, and I'll be willing to form the right angle against Jason if it's not too sacrificial, and in this case, I think I'm sacrificing nothing at all.
