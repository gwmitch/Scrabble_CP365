>Jackson_Smylie: CELNOQT F8 Q. +11 52
>Zev_Kaufman: AERSSTU F8 ..S +14 55
#note TESS(IT)URA is cool. I like I7 U(N)S a lot. 
>Jackson_Smylie: CELNOTW E9 .OWN +18 70
#note WEL(T) 7H is probably better, since giving him an N and S hook with GOWN can't be good. WELT gives up a D an T hook, which isn't as bad. 
>Zev_Kaufman: AEPRSTU 13C PASTURE +81 136
>Jackson_Smylie: CEELMRT H11 TE.CE +24 94
#note I should have considered fishing. I'm down by enough that I don't want to rely on a bingo, but CEELRT bingoes with AEFINOPSUY, many of which are unblockable. MERC/PASTURER is nice, I wasn't sure of the R hook though. MERLE is also superior. TERCE was held and released.
>Zev_Kaufman: EILU 11G U.ILE +10 146
>Jackson_Smylie: DFILMOR 8M DIF +28 122
#note M2 MO(DELE)D is cool. DIF is close behind.
>Zev_Kaufman: ERY J13 RYE +24 170
>Jackson_Smylie: ILMNNOR 12K MINOR +20 142
#note MODELED is still an option, although ILNNR is quite uninspiring. 
>Zev_Kaufman: ERX 14B REX +33 203
>Jackson_Smylie: AILNUVY O12 .ULY +21 163
#note bad misses here. (E)LUVIA is strong, I want to get an E or P or even better a ?. VIOLA is also a lot of points, but RULY is quit ea bit down.
>Zev_Kaufman: EELMOTT 15A METE +39 242
>Jackson_Smylie: ?AINSVZ 6I AZ. +32 195
#note SZ? is a pretty sweet draw.

>Zev_Kaufman: AEELORU B5 AUREOLE +71 325
#note I think I agree with his placement.

>Zev_Kaufman: ?AAGHKW 4H WAG +23 348
>Jackson_Smylie: ABDGINN 11M .N +4 314
#note Hoping to draw the ?, and hoping he misses my bingo. If I draw the ? I get DINGBAt 3B.

>Jackson_Smylie: AS 1F .AS +18 356
#note Not too happy with how I played... GOWN, TERCE, and RULY weren't very strong. Nice playing by Zev! Zev went 1 second over his clock.
