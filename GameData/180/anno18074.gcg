#note Message Lipe privately to find out what I said during this turn. Unfortunately, the best play worked against my goal of shutting the whole thing down.
>Chris_Lipe: GINU D1 GU.IN +34 137
>Winter: ?CIIISW H1 WIS +35 210
#note Quackle heavily favours playing WIS hooking GUQIN, and I'm not sure why.

Didn't know WOUNDY, or I would have played that in a heartbeat.
>Chris_Lipe: AKT 6J KA.T +38 175
#note +5. I hope to be more solid on 4s by Buffalo.
>Winter: ?CIINTY 5D .I.TY +22 232
#note I thought I was being so clever here, killing that line. Little did I know...

#note Well, drat.
>Winter: ?AEIOOR 2L O.A +17 261
#note Dammit, I looked for a longer onderlapping play but missed this one!!!
>Chris_Lipe: ET N5 TE. +20 246

#note I play this conficdent that it gaurantees my win 100%.
>Chris_Lipe: AEGRSST C5 STAGERS +72 383
#note This catches me completely by surprise, and after I do the math, it looks like IF I challange both words, then play a phony, Chris goes out to come within 2 points. BUT I had overscored CAZ by 2!
>Winter: EEHNRRV J9 .HE.. +34 476
#note Lets not even risk a possible phony. Play it safe and win.
