>Fern_Lindzon: BCCMNOT -CC +0 0
>Jackson_Smylie: ACIJRWX 8G JAW +26 26
#note Thought about playing JAW at 8F instead, but if she underlaps in any way the X bomb is dead. I prefer 8G.
>Fern_Lindzon: AEG 7I AGE +11 11
>Jackson_Smylie: CFIMRRX K4 FIX.R +30 56
>Fern_Lindzon: AEINNSS 6C SIENNAS +65 76
#note L4 ANISE for style points.
>Jackson_Smylie: ACMORTT 5E MOAT +26 82
#note Tough play. I considered MOAT, COMA, and TOM. I wanted to put the scoring pressure on and clog up the scoring spot around siennas, so I liked MOAT. I want to move towards a more closed board.
>Fern_Lindzon: CEKU L1 CUKE +36 112
>Jackson_Smylie: CEERTUV -  +0 82
#note Really impulsive challenge. I didn't blink at it, then at the last minute said hold, and didn't think it through properly. 
>Fern_Lindzon: EEIORRT 1G EROTI. +24 136
>Jackson_Smylie: CEERTUV 4A CUVEE +31 113
#note CURVET.
>Fern_Lindzon: AAN M1 ANA +29 165
>Jackson_Smylie: EHIIQRT 7B QI +15 128
#note There's no good spot on the board for the Q. I liked opening up the scoring spot for my H, an easy 45-50 point play if she doesn't have an I. I felt it was a decent game to take, and I figuredher ANA made it slightly less likely for her to have an I. 
>Fern_Lindzon: BETU 8K .EBUT +24 189
>Jackson_Smylie: EHIPRTZ 8A RITZ +83 211
#note Couldn't've worked out much better than that.

#note VILLI is a bit better.
>Fern_Lindzon: EILNNRS L12 .N +2 324
>Jackson_Smylie: ABDDIOT J9 ADD +19 397
#note I knew I would draw an L or N. I saw BIONT if I drew the N, and didn't really think it through for the L, but knew I could get the win.
