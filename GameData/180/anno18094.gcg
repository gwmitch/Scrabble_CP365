#note I'm satisfied with this play, which Quackle considers to be not far from best, but the ones that it likes a little more are PRIVET in the same spot or (its favorite) VIAL 6F.  VIAL is a bit surprising.  It scores a couple more points, but the extra consonant seems to ask for trouble.  It is perhaps the fact that the E stays open (and is likely to be open after the opponent's next turn) that swings the balance in favor of it.  In any event, all of these plays are within a few points of each other.

#note VESTURER# D8 was his best bingo.

#note For a moment I was crestfallen that he had blocked HAMPSTER#, but then I saw that he gave me a different bingo.

#note WEAZENED# would have been a good word to know.  It seems to be an alternate spelling of the TWL-friendly WIZENED.  With a bigger lead, I might have played KNEW, but with the blank in hand I wanted to shed the Z to give myself the best chance to bingo soon.

#note If you find a good move, look for a better one: HYENOID 13B was 102 points.

>Dave_Koenig: AAIORSX M8 IXORAS +44 355
#note I didn't think of AXIS 13A for 6 more points.  However, in this game situation IXORAS might be worth the point sacrifice.  Turning over the extra tiles to try to beat him to the last blank and to end the game sooner is a good strategy here.
