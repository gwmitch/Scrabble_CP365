#note Ottawa Matchplay best of 5. Game 1.

#note Lots of close options here and I unfortunately didn't see them all. 6B IDIOT looks pretty solid. I wasn't a fan of DIGITAL and AGATOID since playing parallel was going to significantly lower Ross's score. But missing IDIOT is a mistake.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: CEGIJOT B10 .OGIE +18 116
#note This play looks gross, but there's nothing available.  B6 GOA sims pretty close with this. It's a play that does nothing but wait for Ross to open the board. Not an awful idea. I think VOGIE is fine though, I guess.

#note Happy to play this quickly. Last two racks ate up a good 6 mins.

#note Quackle sim says M6 EJECT by a couple points, but that's not what I'm going for at this point. What a bizarre play to sim so well

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AEGILPR O1 PAGER +33 331
#note I admit I didn't even consider D3 LIP/LIPA, which kills a bunch of spots at once (albeit while leaving open the O column.) REJIG is dangerous, but my leave is good for the spots it creates. Those two plays sort of float to the top of the sim, but about 8 plays all sim close here. In my opinion, PAGER is fine. Ross could easily have no good plays around JETE.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: FIILRUW D3 FIR +27 358
#note FUJI is such an obvious play and a brainless thing to overlook. It actually sims about even with this play, since it gives back a lot sometimes, but the improved leave may be worth it. Blocking the S spot and scoring is the important thing here, and both plays do it. It's an interesting position to ponder IF YOU ACTUALLY SEE THE PLAYS sigh...

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ILLSTUW G11 .ULL +7 365
#note It's tempting to grab points with WITS or set myself up leaving tiles in the bag with WO or WOT. But the threat through the I is very high. There's a good chance he has something there and there's a good chance I would lose to it, even if I leave 2 in the bag. It felt weird to empty the bag and go up by only 18, but what else is available? Open to ideas. Sim says this wins ~85%.

#note Not good but I'm under a minute left, so I just made sure I could beat LIVING.
