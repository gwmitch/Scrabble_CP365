>Mothra: BDGOORV 8F GOV +14 14
>Geoff: ABEIMTX 9C BEMIX +47 47
#note Between this and just MIX. Quackle likes BEMIX by 3-4 points. 
>Mothra: ABDIORT 10E ABORT +39 53
>Geoff: AFIOOOT 8A FOOT +31 78
#note Was ready to play AFOOT 10E, but Quackle took that spot. Not much else to do here.
>Mothra: DIIJNRT 11B JIRD +36 89
>Geoff: ?AGGIOT B11 .AGG +26 104
#note Thought about JIGOT# in the same spot or 7C GAG (didn't think of 7A IGG, which is better). Took a while on the play. IGG is about 4.5 better; doesn't needlessly open things up like JAGG does. JIGOT is nearly as good as IGG if I'm going to do that. Seems like JAGG has more variance, which I don't necessarily want here.
>Mothra: AAILLNT A12 TAAL +24 113
>Geoff: ?EILOTY D11 .OILY +24 128
#note No bingos here. Not sure how I overlooked 7B OY 23, which is obviously a better leave. ROILY is second, about 3 points worse. Don't see a reason to argue with that.
>Mothra: EIIILNP D4 PINI.. +16 129
>Geoff: ?AAEEST J4 EATAgES +70 198
#note Wouldn't have played it, but didn't think of ASEPTATE#, good one to know. The bingo I did play sims best.
>Mothra: EEHILWY 4H WH.ELY +38 167
>Geoff: EHIMRRS M3 M.RRH +34 232
#note The pool's a little tipped toward vowels, which doesn't help my play here. K3 REHEM 36 controls the board better, and there are lots of E's to go with its IRS leave. Got too focused on MYRRH and didn't spot it.
>Mothra: ADEEINN L7 ADENINE +75 242
>Geoff: AEILNSS E1 SILANES +76 308
#note Lots of bingos here, all of which I hate. Oddly, SALINES in the same spot is 3 better than my SILANES and all the 70-point plays. Not obvious to me why. The details only detect a 2-point edge for our turn #2 (4-ply sim)...
>Mothra: NRTUVWZ 2D W.Z +35 277
>Geoff: EFINOQR K11 QIN +50 358
#note Ah, that'll help. Definitely want to play the N here, 4 points plus one more tile to chase the blank plus obscuring row 14 a little if Quackle has the blank.
>Mothra: NORTUUV L1 VOU.U +18 295
>Geoff: ?EFORSU 15D .OURSElF +89 447
#note Only bingo. Unless there's a 3x3, we got this.
>Mothra: CEENPRT M13 PEC +24 319
>Geoff: ADIKOTU 1A KUDO. +39 486
#note Win pct. is 100 percent now. Sim loves I4 HAIK leaving DOTU way above everything else. KUDOS is third.
>Mothra: DEEENRT 1H ENER.ED +33 352
>Geoff: ACIT I9 A.TIC +14 500
#note Only other out play is A(NE)TIC# for 10, which I didn't think of. 
>Geoff:  (T) +2 502
