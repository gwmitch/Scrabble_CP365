>Tasha_Asberry: AACENOU -AOU +0 0
#note Club game on 6/19/14, game 1.
Actual rack.
>Siddharth_Murali: DEFIOTV 8E FIVE +20 20
#note Quackle puts this very slightly behind FOETID AND VIDEO but I don't think either of them make very much sense here... 
>Tasha_Asberry: AACENU E8 .AUNAE +18 18
>Siddharth_Murali: ADIORTT H7 T.RATOID +60 80
#note Way better than the other TERATOID, imo.
>Tasha_Asberry: EKY G13 KEY +29 47
#note Looks like she missed kye instead
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CEEIQT 12D Q.T +24 104
>Tasha_Asberry: JRU 15D JUR. +22 69
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CEEHIR F10 HE. +29 133
#note Mistakenly told Tasha I didn't draw the blank until later when in fact had it on the third turn, anyway this is clearly best I think, no point in bingoing now as opposed for waiting for her bingo and responding.
>Tasha_Asberry: LN 13G ..LN +9 78
>Siddharth_Murali: ?CEEIIR J11 CI.E +8 141
#note I debated between this and CIRE and this actually sims really well, a tad behind CIRE and IRE, and looking at the stats this cuts things so much that I think this is best.
>Tasha_Asberry: NNO 15A NON.... +51 129
>Siddharth_Murali: ?DEILRR I7 IRED +27 168
#note This is best statically and on the sim, but DIRER is clearly a superior play.
>Tasha_Asberry: ACEILMS J2 MALICES +88 217
>Siddharth_Murali: ?ILNRRU 11J .URL +12 180
#note Sims best!
>Tasha_Asberry: ABORW L8 BAR.OW +28 245
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EIINRS A8 SIRENIa. +74 254
#note Sims best for some weird reason but I should just play a seven for 73 here and kill the board, unfortunately I had a stupid impulse to be fancy and try and draw a challenge, obv unwarranted.
>Tasha_Asberry: GI 13C GI. +19 264
>Siddharth_Murali: DILOPSX M7 POX +44 298
>Tasha_Asberry: OY 8L ..YO +27 291

>Tasha_Asberry: EHSW 4G WH..ES +32 323
>Siddharth_Murali: ABDILOS N6 BA. +18 360
#note A game losing -18% here... DIABOLOS is a pretty inexcusable miss... it's still at 73% now but every win % counts, and I need to hit the books
>Tasha_Asberry: PT K3 P.T +28 351
>Siddharth_Murali: DILOSTV 15J STOLID +31 391
#note I thought I would stand by this but now I see that I like DIVOT or VOID on the left, however this is 31 and her bingo % is only 12 instead of 9 with the other two plays, so I'm not exactly sure this is a mistake, plus I might get the blank anyway
>Tasha_Asberry: ?AEGMOU 5A MOUlAGE +73 424
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEENTV 3C DEAVE +27 418
#note This is -12, but I was low on time and missed GOOF, but I just need to play VAUNTED and hope she really screws up, but there are no technical wins.
>Tasha_Asberry: FGO B4 G.OF +10 434
#note OF is actually +4
>Tasha_Asberry:  (NT) +4 438
#note Not much wrong here besides missing DIABOLOS, but I can't miss that if I ever expect to be a good player, need to ramp up my studying even further now.
