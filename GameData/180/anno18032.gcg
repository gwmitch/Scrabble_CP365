#note Pretty sure this is a mistake, even factoring out hindsigh, as it allows him to bingo and open the board in the process. I got lazy because I had a big lead and it was 11PM. And it almost cost me. No reason not to exchange here.

>dacrON: AAEHHPQ C3 AHE. +18 383
#note Can't take AQ(U)AE here in case he finds SYCAa(M)INE. Turns out he didn't know it. This play does win, but 7A HAE, which I considered, is 6 better. I wanted to leave a 2nd Q play open, as I thought he might win on a Q stick, but Q(U)A probably isn't even any better than a Q stick for me.
>Nigel_Peltier: ?CEINSY A4 YE.Ch +39 354
#note We couldn't find any wins for Nigel, but it seems like blocking QA(ID) and trying to bait me into playing Q(U)A is the best option. I was really low on this time, and it's possible I may have tried Q(U)A if he played off the Y (wasn't thinking as much about (QUA)I! S(KIT) loses by 13 - can you find anything better? BTW, this is not a word, and I was 95% sure it was phony, but with no time and a guaranteed win, I left it.
