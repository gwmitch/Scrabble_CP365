>Conrad: AILNRTV 7F VINAL +22 22
>Sam: ABCGIKO 9H BOCK +23 37
#note KOB 6G is best by a lot and really shuts down the board.
>Conrad: EMNQRTT -QMNT +0 22
#note Quackle prefers keeping the N also; I agree with Conrad here.
>Sam: AEEGIMT K9 .EG +16 53
>Conrad: DEOORST 12H ROOSTED +77 99
>Sam: ACEIIMT N10 ME.IC +32 85
#note Bad play. MEDIC sets up the dangerous O hook, as well as the S. MEDII is safer and keeps a better leave, but best is the sweet AMIDIC (don't know if Sam knew it).
>Conrad: DDIOOPX 15L POOD +41 140
#note Second place to OXID O8 which makes sense- OXID scores 2 more and keeps an O to use the MEDICO spot next turn.
>Sam: ?AAAIST O5 ATAxIAS +74 159
#note ASTASIA scores 1 more point.
>Conrad: ADEIUUX 13I XI +36 176
#note Not a great play- IXIA 13L is clearly best, followed by URAEI H11 (not sure about that one being better than XI).
>Sam: AEGHJTV 11G JAG +24 183
#note -1 valuation to VEG in the same spot.
>Conrad: ABDEUUW -ABUUW +0 176
#note Huge mistake- DAUBE N2 wins the sim by far.
>Sam: EHIPRTV M11 P.H +31 214
>Conrad: ADEIMNR L10 MA. +17 193
#note AIDMEN N2 wins the sim- opening the board and scoring well.
>Sam: BEIRTVY N2 BEVY +29 243
>Conrad: DEINNRT 3H INTERN.D +70 263
>Sam: EEIIRRT O1 RI. +16 259
>Conrad: FHILNQY 2H QI +24 287
#note I actually remember when Q displayed the best play here. SOOOO SEXY. Who can find it?
>Sam: EEIRTTT 6J ET +8 267
#note TERRIT L1 is best.
>Conrad: FHILLNY 4I NIL +10 297
#note Don't understand why it dominates the sim- it doesn't block bingos, just makes them score less.
>Sam: ?EIRTTU 7M UT. +4 271
#note RUT M5 may be a litter better.
>Conrad: EEFHLLY L1 HE.L +30 327
#note Loses about 10 val points to FERLY.
>Sam: ?EIRSTU 5C vIRTUES +66 337
>Conrad: EEFLOUY 14J LEU +14 341
#note He clearly wanted to set up his Y hook, but placing LEU at 4D wins a whopping 9% more (53 vs. 44 percent). I guess this could give Sam a game-winning play on row 15, particular with ZAS or something like that.
>Sam: AADEORS 15F ROADS +22 359
#note Champ chooses ROADIE D1? Regular simming puts AVO C4 for 2 points in first by a lot after 1500 iterations! Next are AHA and AAH 1K/J...guess Q doesn't like blocking. Yes, the sim results are the sim when I plug in the oppo partial rack of Y...interesting. Theories?
>Conrad: EEFNOYZ 14E FEY +20 361
#note Game-winner here. Wins the sim by 20 val points and 26 win%
>Sam: AAENRWW 13C WAE +17 376
>Conrad: AENOZ 12A AZON +37 398
>Sam: NRUW D4 W.N +12 388
>Conrad: E D4 ...E +7 405
#note Neither of them played superbly, but given the context, they played just fine.
>Conrad:  (RU) +4 409
