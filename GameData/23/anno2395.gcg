#note i thought about CROWER but thought the IU leave was just too much worse than the U, plus turning over the extra tile might help. 5J WEIRDO is a good move too. (-2)

#note i looked for a while for a bingo starting with S, there's only 1. BAILoRS is probably better than tribals because you can't bingo thru the T or R, but it's more under-lappable. 11B RAILBuS sims highest of the 11B bingos for some reason i can't figure out. (-7) compared to ScRIBAL O9
