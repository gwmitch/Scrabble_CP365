>bing: CITY 8G CITY +18 18
>Jason: AEGISSZ J8 .AG +11 11
#note This sims best.  Perhaps speaks to the power of bing's opening move (his rack was CINTTY? and he chose this over NITTY) that I'm scoring 11 points with AEISSZ on my rack.
>bing: ?BDGINT 11I DINGBaT +78 96
>Jason: EINSSVZ L8 ZIN.S +50 61
#note So here's the losing mistake.  But honestly... I'm not sure I even know ZANIES.  Obviously I would have played it if I'd seen it and known for sure it was good--but just didn't know it.  [-14]
>bing: EEHINRW O8 WHI.ENER +185 281
>Jason: AEMPRSV N10 P.M +26 87
#note Probably MAP is a bit better here to not give up the SOME/SAME stuff.  Frustrating to have all the nongos.

#note OKA and a number of other plays are a bit higher--this is just not a good situation to be in, 6 vowels and 200 points back on bing.
>bing: AJRTU L1 JURAT +52 438
>Jason: AAEIIOO 1L .IAO +33 240
#note 7 vowels?  No worries.
>bing: PX G11 P.X +37 475
>Jason: ADEIINO 5B IODINA.E +68 308
#note I wanted to leave the most lanes open.  I don't think the points matter much here.  [-2]  Note from AAEIIOO last turn I score 101 in 2 turns!  Lucky, eh?

>Jason: EFNOOSU C7 FOU +22 330
>bing: AQT 4E QAT. +27 538
>Jason: EINNOSU C2 ON +11 341
#note Blocking UNIONISE.   Quackle likes NOUS or ONUS here.  I guess I can't argue too much.  I just wanted another lane but the U is indeed a handicap.
>bing: AEHM K3 AHEM +35 573
>Jason: EILNSSU 1C SILENUS +77 418
>Jason:  (OORR) +8 426
#note Well, I didn't play that one too badly--ZANIES was a pretty big deal though, as it turned out.
