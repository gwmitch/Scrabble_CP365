#note I briefly considered exchanging three, but quickly thought better of it and dropped the Q bomb.  Duck agrees.

>Gary_Perman: BJ 8G J.B +12 12
>Pete: CEEEINT J6 CEE +24 46
#note I love it when the right play is so easy.  
>Gary_Perman: Y I8 .Y +11 23
>Pete: DEEINTU K8 DETINUE +81 127
#note His last play looked like a clear and obvious fish, so I considered suboptimal placement of the bingo at 10C.  But 13 points were too much to sacrifice, and it would have left the E in the double-double column.  Funny, now that I haven't really focused on Scrabble in a while, I'm far more thoughtful about my plays.  even an easy play like this one, I spent the time to think about.    
>Gary_Perman: AMT L11 TAM +20 43
>Pete: ADEIPRX M13 PIX +38 165
#note Best again.  I took a while on this play as well... I figured I was giving up a likely 36 point reply, but with Gary in fish mode and theoretically likely to bingo soon, maybe I'd get that for an easy response if ADER doesn't improve.  
>Gary_Perman: EKOW 10F WOKE +27 70
>Pete: ADDDEFR J11 FARD +36 201
#note best again.  I was torn between this play and FARDED e9.  Apparently, DDE is a better leave than D, which I sort of suspected.  
>Gary_Perman: AA E10 AA +16 86
>Pete: CDDEIOV 15L O.ID +39 240
#note Gary didn't leave me an E to play through, so OXID was clearly best, despite the CDEV leave.  I didn't like opening the O column with him fishing, but the points were too many to pass up with a lead, and I no other play really jumped out as reasonable.
>Gary_Perman: RU 6J .UR +5 91
>Pete: CDENSTV -CDV +0 240
#note big miss here, to make up for the good plays earlier.  Partly this was inspired by the fact that Gary looked askance at my original play of FARD, and I wanted to save the S hook, hoping he'd not use it.  partly, I get too exchange happy and S protective, which will come back to F*** me one day.  Ducks choice of VENDS 15F nicely kills the bottom of the board, and with two lines open on the right half, I can still play back if he finally hit.  When up, take the points.  -18.4 equity, -1.5% win %
>Gary_Perman: ?ALRSTW O8 WRASTLe. +86 177
>Pete: EEMNSTU N9 EMU +25 265
#note best.  Scores, leaves well, leaves an open board when I'm drawing at ENST with a lead.  Also eliminates the possibility of the cheap Z bomb.
>Gary_Perman: EHPRY M3 HYPER +34 211
#note Gary was the highest rated player in Div. B at Elyria.  He had the option to play up, but he almost always chooses not to... he's a stronger player than anyone else I played Sunday... I probably miss HYPER, and I was starting to worry about this game. Gary is a Pittsburgh player, and he would beat me consistently when I was coming up... lately I've turned the tables, but he's always a tough foe, and the games usually turn out to be fairly exciting.
>Pete: ABELNST L2 LAB +29 294
#note I miss the bingo he nicely left for me, ABSENTL(Y).  My play is second best... with the S in reserve, I don't mind opening a second S hook line on a triple line.  If he bingoes on one, I can hit back on the other.  
>Gary_Perman: ?FIINOS 1I FIsSION +87 298
>Pete: EILNOST 15D ENTOILS +83 377
#note And I finally hit on ENST.  Only playable bingo... easy play.  And the timing was perfect... Gary had taken his first lead after the last play, and I had to kill the momentum.  If I had missed, I probably would have killed the S hook there and tried to outrace him.

>Gary_Perman: AAH 12C AAH +18 316
>Pete: DGNRUVZ C11 Z.G +26 403
#note and now, something I saw blessedly few of this tourney, a truly awful rack.  Duck likes VUG, which I think is kinda crazy.  I'm nowhere close to bingoing, and I don't want to give back an easy 30+ point response down the A column.  I like its second choice, V(A)NG C11 somewhat better than my play, but I think my choice works.  Unless he bingoes back immediately, he is forced to open up the board in this situation, and I hold the V to help close it down.  
>Gary_Perman: GO I1 .OG +9 325
#note Abierto...
>Pete: DNORTUV 3G VU. +11 414
#note Cerrado. Duck likes the flashy VOUD(O)N 2E at first, but VUG wins sim, probably due to the OVER bingoes VOUDON permits. It's a very close call, and I would have stuck with VUG anyways.  I'm forcing him into either a desperate play or conceding the game, and DRNOT is a decent leave, if I can catch a couple of vowels, to take advantage of an opening.
>Gary_Perman: GI G3 .IG +7 332
>Pete: DILNORT 4F D.N +8 422
#note Gary's VIG puts me in a tougher position than I'd hoped.  I can't really block the S (or A) hook without opening a line for eights... I block the INGS line instead.  Duck reall likes NOIL 14D for 16, which I suppose leaves you in good shape should he bingo, but otherwise, seems a bit risky.  the no Vowel leave worries me there.  Any thoughts?

>Gary_Perman: O F9 O. +5 337
>Pete: AILNORT 6F LA +12 434
#note I really wanted the desperation board opening play there.  When Gary didn't oblige, I was puzzled.  LA wins the sim,  and leaves two in the bag, which gives him the chance to open the board, and me the chance to bingo out in response.
>Gary_Perman: EV 5E VE. +18 355
#note rather than try for the insane miracle, Gary plays to cut spread here.  With the unseen pool, probably the right decision, but I probably would have gone for the hail mary.
>Pete: CEINORT -  +0 434
#note I passed here.  I didn't want to do anything stupid and open the board, I didn't know CRUMP (must learn some 5's) and I wanted to see if he might fall into a trap and give me a bingo line or another big play by using the S hook on ZAG.  The game was out of reach, so I figured that in round 15, it was safe to play for spread.  Maybe not the according to Hoyle play, but I stand by it.
>Gary_Perman: EENORST N5 ES +17 372
#note missing SET, which somehow has a .02 win %.
>Pete: CEINORT H12 CON. +9 443
#note way bad, but it leaves likely outs and doesn't open.  I just wanted to play safe, and CONI was, if nothing, safe.
>Gary_Perman: ENORT 7C TONE +10 382
#note I counted on him not knowing TRONE, and he didn't.

>Pete: EIRT 8B TIRE +12 455
#note Took the points, instead of the slightly cooler (N)ITRE/(PE)E at O1.  Fun game, for the most part I'm pleased with my decisionmaking in it.  Please feel free to disparage, criticize and make fun of it on my LJ.
