>Sam: DEELNOO H7 LOONED +18 18
#note This is phony. It turns out DOOLEE 8D (or H4, as it were) sims better anyway. I considered it, but isn't E better than N??? I opened down for Stefan, because I know he always opens down.
>Stefan_Rau: ABEORTY 10B BARYTO.E +71 71
#note The reason he let LOONED* go.
>Sam: AEEEIOQ -EEIOQ +0 18
#note I screwed this up and don't want to redo the whole game...anyway, I traded AEEIOQ, not EEIOQ, as evidenced by my next rack.

>Stefan_Rau: IKP H1 PIK. +30 194
>Sam: AEIINOR 3H .OI +13 130
#note NORIA N2 is best by far, with this second...wasn't ready to pull the trigger on CHASTISER.
>Stefan_Rau: AADGIRT 2F GR.D +14 208
>Sam: AEIJLNR 12A JIN +27 157
#note RAJ N4 is easily best, followed by JARL N2 and JIN. Again, CHASTISER.
>Stefan_Rau: AAV A12 .AVA +42 250
>Sam: ABEELNR 8L .ARB +21 178
#note Quackle hates this, and with good reason. I won't even try to defend it. ENABLE 11H is best, and VERBAL 14A and BLARE N1 are also good choices.
>Stefan_Rau: ALTU 14A .AULT +16 266
>Sam: EEILNST 11H .NLISTEE +72 250
#note I know I'm still going to be a little down after my bingo, but that doesn't justify SETLINE K9 75, does it?
