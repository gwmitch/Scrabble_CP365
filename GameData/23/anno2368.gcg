>Jeremy: CDENORT 8G COD +12 12
#note Exch D and Exch T sim about the same.  DOC is one point back, but COD is 4.5 points back for giving up the hooks.  I liked giving up a hook here because I didn't want my opponent to come back with V(O)X through DOC and box me in.
>deen: ADMN J7 DAMN +16 16
>Jeremy: ENNORRT H7 N.R +3 15
#note 9J (M)ORN is 2 points back keeping the same leave RENT.  My play takes out the -E(D) ending, plus it only scores 3, but it is a decent fishing rack (TONER).
>deen: DIU 10F DUI +12 28
>Jeremy: ENOORTT K9 OOT +12 27
#note Best
>deen: AEIJLRS L4 JAILERS +88 116
>Jeremy: EEINORT M4 OE +13 40
#note I didn't look hard enough... If I get an ERECTION I'll find NEOTERI(C) G1.  Ugh.  A 28 point blow for missing the bingo.
>deen: GIV N2 VIG +25 141
>Jeremy: EINRRTY 8L .YRE +21 61
#note M9 EYRIR for 32 is worth the extra points.  5.8 point miss.
>deen: AX N8 .AX +26 167
>Jeremy: INOORST 12F NITROSO +70 131
#note Sims a bit better than TORSION at 12H or 11A
>deen: AEK K5 KA +28 195
>Jeremy: AEEIPPT 11C PIPE +20 151
#note Best.  H12 (T)EPA is not bad either, keeps the board open.
>deen: LOTU 13C LOUT +13 208
>Jeremy: AEFRTUW H12 .UFA +21 172
#note No place for this ugly seven.  My play is best for keeping the board open.  From playing with a lead, I think FEW at 13L would be best, but I need to bingo.
>deen: ?LMOSST 15F MO.TLeSS +60 268
>deen: ?LMOSST --  -60 208
#note Deen missed M(A)LTOSes and (F)LOTSaMs.  I have this play on hold for a long time before I decide to challenge it, because it looks sort of good.
>Jeremy: ?AEERTW 15H .WEAThER +83 255
#note This is the only 83 point bingo.  The rest score 61.
>deen: ?LMOSST 10B MOT +17 225
#note Quack likes 14B MOSTS here
>Jeremy: BENNNQY 13L YEN +17 272
#note 14J BYE keeping NNNQ wins.  Keeping NNNQ never crossed my mind.  My play is 11 points worse.
>deen: ?LSST 3M T.L +12 237
>Jeremy: BGHINNQ 14B QI +24 296
#note This play just seems stupid.  I'm giving back 40 points if Deen has an I.  But I am shedding the damn Q.  O7 B(E)NIGN is best by almost 13.
>deen: ?AEIRSS B3 AStERIS. +61 298
>Jeremy: BEGGHNN 8A H.NGE +33 329
#note 8A N(I)GH (one of the fours I miss most).  Keep the E and score more.  4 points better.
>deen: DEIV 15A VIDE +42 340
#note There's that 40 points I was talking about.
>Jeremy: AABEGNW A1 WAB +28 357
#note A1 WANE wins 63.23% - My play is 2nd at 59.15% and 1.5 points back

>deen: CEFHILU C1 ICH +32 372
>Jeremy: ABEGNZ E3 BEGAZ. +36 393
#note K14 Z(A) nets 10 more.  Just GAZE doesn't let Deen play out.
>deen: EFLU F2 FE +17 389
#note Deen misses his out F1 FUEL (he is low on time)
>Jeremy: N F2 ..N +8 401
>Jeremy:  (LU) +4 405
