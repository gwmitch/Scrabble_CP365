#note It looks like some other valid words (AGENETIC, ARGENTIC).  When I glanced at it while he was putting it down, I thought he was playing AGENETIC but then I realized you can't open with an 8.
>Ross_B.: ACEGINT --  -76 0
>Brad_W.: DEEFIRT -EF +0 0
#note I wasn't going to give him the letter he needed.

#note 3G R(A)VINED 32 looks better but I went for style points.
>Ross_B.: EHIINOR 5D HERI.ION +94 118
>Ross_B.: EHIINOR --  -94 24
#note What a crazy game.  After 7 turns, there is just one 8-letter word on the board--and nothing else.

>Brad_W.: JORSTWY 3G J.Y +34 91
#note JAW is better in the same spot.  Better to keep the Y than W.
>Ross_B.: EINOPRV I8 OVERPIN +70 115
>Ross_B.: EINOPRV --  -70 45
#note I was not sure about this one, but if I challenged the other two, I'm sure as hell gonna challenge this one too.
>Brad_W.: IIORSTW -WOI +0 91
#note Normally I might play through this, but he had just given me (another) free turn so I decided to improve my rack.
>Ross_B.: EINOPRV 5D PIVO. +20 65
>Brad_W.: ?IRRSTT 8H .RITTeRS +77 168
#note I wasn't 100% sure of this but thought I remembered it from studying.
>Ross_B.: DEFGNR J6 FR.NGED +24 89
#note I held this but didn't challenge.  If it was a bingo, I probably would have challenged (it's good).

>Brad_W.: AAEHNOS 15H HA +34 414
#note I learned my lesson from my last game against him.  I decided to block any crazy underlapping bingos down here.  He still has the lane up top but I'm going to score enough down here to withstand it.  I guessed that AZON would still be there for me next turn.
