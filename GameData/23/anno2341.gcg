>Cesar: AINNOPR 3K .INO +28 152
#note 3I RADON is another good choice
>rpd: EOW 2F WOE +17 116
>Cesar: ANNPRTW D1 PRAWN +28 180
#note [-1.5] the same word at D5 is a litlte better.
>rpd: CEKNOSY C3 YO +25 141
>Cesar: AENOTUZ D7 AZON +28 208
#note i wish i remembered why i stuck the N on.. maybe turnover? i was turning over more at this point and there are 4 Ss unseen. still AZO is way better defensively. 1A UNAPT is another good choice.[-2]

#note missed a nice bingo that i saw this time. NETSUKE. [-30]

#note now this is the move that rpd basically called me nuts for making (when i told her i didn't have the B at the end of the game). i maintained that it was still a good move. the simulation basically bears me right, although it is just under 1A HELP (i coulda sworn it won last time i did this sim). i thought that at least i could cash out on the top left if i didn't draw a bingo, and i kept a good leave, what's so bad about this? you gotta take a risk once in a while. [-0.4]
>rpd: AINSV A4 SAVIN +35 312
>Cesar: ?DENOOY A1 ON +23 326
#note i was a little too focused on the top left and didn't see 3F OY. [-10]
>rpd: IQTU 15D QUIT. +24 336
>Cesar: ?BDEIOY C9 BE.DY +37 363
#note i didn't even look for a bingo here, it's embarrassing because i apparently had DI?OBEY on my rack spelled out like that. i think i was so focused on outscoring at this point and realized that BEADY won. by valuation i only lose [-3.5] points.
>rpd: CCDIIRT N8 RICTIC +18 354
#note robin told me she was basically trying to make up spread here, i wasn't about to blow a sure win unless i'm 100% sure of it. 13G DEFICIT is the play tho
