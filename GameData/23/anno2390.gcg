>Jason: EGLLMOP 8F GLOP +14 14
#note JI: Don't tell Matt Graham I missed GOLEM, half of his dream AV(GOLEM)ONO opening sequence. This is close, though.
>George_Viebranz: AJ F6 JA. +27 27
>Jason: ELMNOST G5 MOL. +19 33
#note JI: Didn't think he'd go for MOLTENS* and my brain kind of forgot to, oh, look for others! I've twice in recent tournaments missed M(E)LTON as a dump ... apparently I have a block against that word. LOMENTS and M(O)ONLETS also missed. At least I picked best among the non-bingos! (Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln...) As you can see, I'm about to get deservedly whacked.
>George_Viebranz: ACEOX H1 COXAE +49 76
>Jason: EINOOST 1H .OONTIES +83 116
#note JI: This is one of those words that just never looks right, even as I put it on the board.
>George_Viebranz: EF 2J FE +28 104
>Jason: CEKNNQR -CKNQ +0 116
#note JI: Even if I was 100% sure of (NE)CKER, which I saw, I don't think I would've played it. Same for (I)CKER, which I had no confidence in. Speedy likes a bunch of exchanges ahead of this: keeps of CEKR, CENR, CEKNR (???) and CER.
>George_Viebranz: DEY 3F DE.Y +20 124
>Jason: ENNORRU K1 ..URON +12 128
#note JI: I would start becoming really frustrated with my draws right around here. Missed the slightly superior (T)URNON.
>George_Viebranz: GLU 9D LUG +17 141
>Jason: AEINRRR 8A RARE +18 146
#note JI: Hate parting with E's (perhaps too much), but Speedy says it's clear-cut.
>George_Viebranz: ABW 4J B.AW +18 159
>Jason: AAINORZ N4 NAZI +43 189
#note JI: Speedy's choice, but daring. Championship Player puts it slightly behind its leader of AZO at 3M. Sim would probably hate it worse, esp. if I gave George an S, which I assumed he had from probability/his past three plays.
>George_Viebranz: ?ACEEST A8 .ETrACES +80 239
>Jason: AEHIORW M7 HOWE +27 216
#note JI: Didn't know (C)AHOW, Speedy's pick. I'm surprised Championship Player puts this ninth and HOW second, flanked by (C)HOW and (C)AHOW.
>George_Viebranz: DEIK O7 DIKE +34 273
>Jason: AEGIIRR 13A .IGAR +16 232
#note JI: Happy to see this; nearly missed it. Championship Player says it's seventh, but I'd play it again in this situation.
>George_Viebranz: IQ 2E QI +18 291
>Jason: DEILRST D13 .D +3 235
#note JI: Don't know why I didn't drop it at B14 for 12 or O11 for 11. I want to open the triple line, but is it worth sacrificing nine? Championship Player says the star play is (L)I(D) at B12, for 16.
>George_Viebranz: BFO 12D FOB +32 323
>Jason: ?EILRST 11E TaILERS +83 318
#note JI: Gotta love this game. I turnover, turnover, turnover: nothing. Fish off one and pick the blank. Looked for something at 15A that hooked to FAD ... isn't there. Back in it, but at the mercy of the bag.
>George_Viebranz: EMN N10 MEN +22 345
>Jason: DHIINPT H10 P.INTH +36 354
#note JI: So relieved to see George give a slight head nod as I put it down. I wasn't at all sure ... couldn't remember where I'd seen it (still can't), which made me wonder if I was "making it up out of whole cloth," as Divorce Court's Judge Lynn Toler might say. Good thing I found it ... it's the only real play. 40+% win chance versus the 33.33% of (FE)INT, which I wouldn't have seen if you gave me an hour.
>George_Viebranz: Y 4J .....Y +18 363
>Jason: AADITTV O12 AVID +30 384
#note JI: Guaranteed win. I wanted George to empty so I could play VI(T)TA at 14F, setting up TAD for 20 (L8) or 14 (7B). Still, no matter what I pick (I had EINRSTUU as the pool ... don't ask how), I've got TAT at 7B or (U)TA at 3K and felt safe.
>George_Viebranz: EINRSUV 4B VIRUS +20 383
>Jason: ATTU 3K .TA +18 402
#note JI: Like I said, I had the V gone (must've messed up when I was crossing off the letters in my rack), so this made me worry a little. Had time to re-track the whole game (and figured this is the play with 99+% of his leaves anyway), though, so no worries. Missed the out of (S)UTTA. This is the only other win. Very well played, George. I hated to do it to you on what turned out to be a 2-6 day.
