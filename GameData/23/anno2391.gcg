>Jason: BEGHHIS 8G HIGH +22 22
#note Didn't know HEIGH. Shoot.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ER 8G ....ER +14 14
#note Jeff Clark and Kevin (George's and my respective opponents) watched the end of our re-count. "Whale of a game, guys," Kevin said when he heard the final score. Indeed it was.
>Jason: BEEEOOS 7J OBOE +18 40
#note Fortunately the EEOO draw doesn't hurt too much.
>Kevin_McCarthy: IJ K5 JI.. +26 40
>Jason: ?AEELRS N1 cEREALS +73 113
#note 73's the most I can get. This looked most defensive; no cheap plays from O1 available. This or vEALERS, maybe.
>Kevin_McCarthy: AER 1L RA.E +12 52
#note Zyz says there are eight four-tile front extensions to RACE; the only one I saw (didn't look hard, admittedly) was DISG(RACE).
>Jason: AADILNZ 3K IZA. +26 139
#note Missed ADZ at M3, 20 better. Too satisfied with knowing I'd have AL(E) for 30 (4L) or DAL for 23 (9K) next turn.
>Kevin_McCarthy: AY 4L AY. +39 91
>Jason: ADDDLNR 9K DAD +25 164
>Kevin_McCarthy: OOOOO -OOOOO +0 91
>Jason: DEKLLNR 7F LEK +20 184
#note Set up just like I like it; any bingo gives me comebacks along the triple.
>Kevin_McCarthy: AOV 6D OVA +12 103
#note Kevin said he exchanged OOV and two vowels and had to sarcastically laugh when he pulled OOV on the exchange.
>Jason: ADELNRR C3 DARN +17 201
#note Maybe a little too fancy, but I'm making it hard to bingo while maintaining the good-sized lead.
>Kevin_McCarthy: OU M9 .UO +4 107
>Jason: ELNNRRS -LNRN +0 201
#note All my plays open up the board. Slightly unorthodox to pitch the N, too; but I didn't want to draw three more consonants and watch him bingo. Given all the T's out, and still three N's to draw, I like this exchange.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ACENOST 12G OCTANES +79 186
>Jason: DELRSTU 13A RUSTLED +75 276
#note LUSTRED's probably better.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ELOUV A8 LOUVE. +30 216
>Jason: CEFIQRS 4B F.QIR +34 310
#note Blocked FIQ(U)E, but can't be too unhappy with this alternative.
>Kevin_McCarthy: INW 11E WIN +16 232
>Jason: CEEMSTT 14F MET +26 336
#note Yeah, a little ballsy to create an opening like this, but Championship Player agrees, giving me a 97.97% win chance.
>Kevin_McCarthy: BGO 10D GOB +27 259
>Jason: CEGSTTX B12 T.X +22 358
#note Best, says Q.
>Kevin_McCarthy: OY 15H OY +21 280
#note Now I can breathe easy, as the only threatening line is killed.
>Jason: CEEGIST D12 E.IC +18 376
>Kevin_McCarthy: IM N10 MI +22 302
#note A little problematic with both P's out (although I just pulled one).
>Jason: AEFGPST 11J FE +19 395
#note Gah! Missed F(I)T at 6J for 35! Stoopid!
>Kevin_McCarthy: W E9 W.. +9 311
>Jason: AGNPPST G2 GASP +26 421
#note OK, so I missed out on 20 points by not playing P(I)T, but it won't matter 'cause I have a tie. Right?
>Kevin_McCarthy: ?IINNTU 6I UN.T +18 329
#note Best. Should've played P(I)T first instead of assuming he'd make a play hooking to FAQIR/blocking non-existent out bingos.
>Jason: NPT 3G .PT +6 427
#note One worse than ANT, same spot.
>Kevin_McCarthy: ?IIN B9 IN +10 339
>Jason: N H7 ..N +7 434
#note Of my six wins Saturday, the only "easy" one. Back to three over .500 at 4.5-1.5.
>Jason:  (I?) +2 436
