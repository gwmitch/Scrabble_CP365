>John_Viloria: EEHRX 8D HEXER +38 38
>Jason: DDEFPSW 7E FEW +36 36
#note I have my rack written as DDEFNSW, but I'm almost sure I had a P/didn't leave DDNS.
>John_Viloria: HINW 9B WHIN +25 63
>Jason: DDEFNPS 6F DEF +32 68
#note Ooh, DE(FEN)DS would've been cool, but this is only four worse.
>John_Viloria: GIJ I5 JIG +21 84
>Jason: DLMNOPS 10A POM +23 91
#note Wow, Speedy likes POMS instead? Seven more, three-consonant leave instead of four. I know I overvalue the S, but it's got to be more valuable than that, right?
>John_Viloria: NY E7 ...NY +22 106
>Jason: DLNOOOS A10 .OOL +7 98
#note Tic-tac-toe as I draw OOO! I hated this play, but except for the leader, (P)ODSOL (which I didn't know), Speedy's better plays are all down column J and give up too much in return, esp. if he has a B or Y. I considered NOLOS at J2, but passed it up. Oh, if JOO* were good in something other than Spazzble...
>John_Viloria: ALR 5I .ARL +22 128
>Jason: DENNORS B9 ..N +8 106
>John_Viloria: BY D11 BY +21 149
#note Ah, he gets both Y's and neither of us will play (WHIN)Y/(DEX)Y for 29. I forgot to ask if he missed it or was just consonant-heavy both times.
>Jason: DEINORS M3 ROSINED +84 190
#note Hi, Sam!
>John_Viloria: CMR 8L M.RC +33 182
>Jason: ACEISUU K3 CU.IA +7 197
#note U(M)IAC at L7, stopping one short of the double, is intriguing. (What is with my block against that word and its spellings?) A few mediocre candidates; your play is certainly better than mine.
>John_Viloria: ??AAELN 13C AEoLiAN +70 252
#note Interesting that he didn't play to the C ... I assume he had to see at least one of the 14 that scored 77.
>Jason: AEEGKSU H12 K.GU +42 239
#note Tough play, esp. into a vowel-heavy pool, but nothing else is comparable. C'mon, T's!
>John_Viloria: IOOZ 9I ZOOI. +29 281
>Jason: AEEOSTV 10I AE +19 258
#note Maybe OVA at 10G? A better opening play, definitely.
>John_Viloria: ER A10 ....ER +24 305
#note On that goof-up turn long ago, I couldn't decide on POLO or POOL. Guess I picked wrong.
>Jason: EOPSTUV 14H .UV +17 275
#note Speedy's choice, which I figured, but boy, this makes the board suck. My hope was that he couldn't afford to score nothing and block the C- line, lest I outrun. But still, I'm thinking "Played three U's, I'm either gonna draw the fourth and have it kill my bingo chances or pick the Q at the most inopportune time." Indeed, the latter came to pass.
>John_Viloria: AITV O4 VATI. +14 319
#note Well, so much for "he can't block, lest I outrun."
>Jason: EOPRSTT I3 RE... +14 289
#note More equity-hemorrhaging (20+ points' worth) to open in about the only way possible. Sim seems to like PST at 11I, gets me with 17 and maybe I can outrun, with RE(JIG) still a possibility to open.
>John_Viloria: EO F10 OE +16 335
>Jason: ELOPSTT H1 STOP +36 325
#note Putting myself at the mercy of the bag.
>John_Viloria: AEINSTT 1A INSTATE. +77 412
#note Well, that's about a worst-case scenario.
>Jason: AEILQTT E1 .LT +3 328
#note Ugh. Even with QI and QAT, I can't see a place to set it up. Not even if I draw the D for QAID/QADI (which I would)! Maybe play for the I being in the bag? I was short on time, though. Even if the I's in the bag, his rack's so balanced, he can prolly block it all. TI at 2E? I dunno. I also didn't have a lot of time left by this point.
>John_Viloria: ABDGISU 3C GU. +8 420
#note Does the job. Championship player likes DUI at 2A.
>Jason: ADEIQT C3 .ID +5 333
#note Yeah, I was like under a minute here.
>John_Viloria: ABDIS 4B B. +4 424
#note Again, not among Q's top picks, but it does the job. He was short on time, too; he took a lot at the beginning, I took a lot at the end.
>Jason: AEQT D3 .TE +19 352
#note (T)A(U)T's one better.
>John_Viloria: ADIS K11 AIDS +18 442
#note AI(DE)D, because the difference between my A and his S will be worth it. "I drew everything," he said afterward. Well, not entirely true. 2-2, with the two losses being my two best-played games.
>John_Viloria:  (AQ) +22 464
