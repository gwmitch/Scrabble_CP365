>Jeff_Clark: BDEIOOW 8D WOODIE +28 28
>Jason: DENRSUY E7 Y.URN +16 16
#note Again, I do a mediocre job in striking a balance between scoring and keeping good stuff. Championship Player likes playing the Y at I7; this isn't even on the board.
>Jeff_Clark: AABHINR J7 BRAIN +20 48
#note Missing HAIRBAN(D).
>Jason: BDEGOST 11H BO.G +14 30
>Jeff_Clark: AAEHQUZ K4 HAZE +36 84
#note Like it way better than QUA(R)E at 10B, esp. given the leave. Nice setup.
>Jason: CDEOSTU L9 SCOUTED +82 112
#note Linda Hoggatt, who played at Jeff's board next, picked up the tiles and laughed. "When I saw BONGO, I'm like 'Bingo, bango, bongo? Is bango good? What about Irving?'" :)
>Jeff_Clark: AGPQTUV L3 QAT +36 120
#note QUAG, same spot.
>Jason: AEEEILR M2 LIE +34 146
#note Thanks to Jeff for making my decision easy.
>Jeff_Clark: GMNPTUV 15L .UMP +27 147
>Jason: AEEIRRR H11 .ARER +24 170
#note I'm surprised BRIER is so superior. 1.7 equity points and Championship Player says 57.21% to BARER's 53.45%.
>Jeff_Clark: GHNNSTV M7 NTH +20 167
#note "This was a bad play," Jeff said after the game. "I should've exchanged." Speedy likes it; though it wants the placement at N4 for the extra point. Championship Player's pick is V(E)NT at 14G, followed closely by V(A)NS at 12G, passing GHNV, passing GHNNV, then NTH. So, not a bad play at all (esp. given what happens next).
>Jason: DEEEILR N12 DEE. +14 184
#note No sense in fishing on this board. But I don't know if this is any better.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEGNSV O7 AVeNGES +89 256
>Jason: EIKLNNR G3 LINKE. +13 197
#note Missed playing same tiles, same order, with LINKE(R) at 13C, among the many better plays.
>Jeff_Clark: ?DEEOTT 13C DOTTE.El +70 326
#note DETEcTO(R)'s the only one along the triple.
>Jason: AFINRSW H1 WAIF +53 250
#note I'm not dead yet, but the priest is administering last rites.
>Jeff_Clark: IIMORSY 12B YOM +27 353
#note (BRAIN)I(l)Y gets mondo style points.
>Jason: ILLNPRS 12G P.L +12 262
#note PLINKED is good! Shoot; P(A)LL at 2G's definitely the play.
>Jeff_Clark: AGIIIRS 5C GRAI.S +25 378
>Jason: FIJLNRS B10 FL. +17 279
>Jeff_Clark: EIIOOTU A10 OE +9 387
>Jason: ACIJNRS N1 CIS +26 305
#note Should've played the J here while I could still do it for points.
>Jeff_Clark: AIIOTUX D2 IXO.A +24 411
#note (G)IT, Championship Player's choice, is cool, setting up the X bomb. I think I block with VA(T), then he plays I(LI)A, setting up another X bomb unblockable with my rack. Nice.
>Jason: AJNRV 2C J.N +10 315
>Jeff_Clark: ITU I2 IT +9 420
#note Jeff said he had me mistracked here.
>Jason: ARV 1F VA. +9 324
#note And I blow 27 equity points by not going out. Why? I couldn't remember if MOR was good. Seriously. Just a total blank. I played so bad post-DOTTEREl, but hey, I had a tie and spread wasn't going to matter. Right?
>Jeff_Clark: U E2 .U +11 431
#note "You got bagged," Jeff said. (Who am I to argue?) :)
>Jeff_Clark:  (R) +2 433
