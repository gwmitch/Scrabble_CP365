>Jason: EEGORUU 8E EURO +8 8
#note Nope. Exchanging keeping ER. Even passing all seven is better.
>Winter: ADINTWZ E4 WINZ.D +38 38
#note I'd let Winter get away with phonies in our first two meetings, so I vowed not to let him phony me here. That didn't even last a turn! In some consolation, Kelly McKenzie was shocked it was phony.
>Jason: ?BEGHNU 9H HUB +14 22
#note Missed BUNGH(O)lE and B(O)UGHtEN, neither of which I knew.
>Winter: AAAJKTV D1 JAVA +54 92
#note "An appropriate word for you," I joked. He said he'd missed it in his last tourney. (Counted as 52.)
>Jason: ?AEGNOS K7 ONStAGE +73 95
#note Championship player likes the only 75-pointer, ONAGErS at 10H.
>Winter: AFGKMNT 13J K.NAF +24 116
#note Though Winter doesn't "associate his name with the season" (then why'd he pick it?), it is appropriate. I'm laughing and joking with Linda Hoggatt and Kelly McKenzie, and then Winter sits down and it all stops. Like a sudden "cold snap" hit the table...
>Jason: DOOPRRS O8 DROOPS +49 144
#note Nearly missed this, which would've sucked.
>Winter: CEGIMTU N11 MU.TI +28 144
#note Winter noted that he missed (J)UICE this turn.
>Jason: DILNRTT 15K NIT.D +21 165
#note Missed NITR(I)D.
>Winter: ACEEEGR 1D .AEGER +42 186
#note Finally the spot gets used!
>Jason: EFHLORT 2F FOH +38 203
#note Missed LO(A)TH at 2B for 47, but this is close.
>Winter: ?ACENTY L1 CYANiTE +80 266
#note ChANTEY is three more.
>Jason: AEELLRT 1L .ELL +18 221
#note Oh, how'd I miss LAETR(i)LE?! Sheesh!
>Winter: AEEGRTW M3 WET +25 291
>Jason: ACDEERT C4 CATERED +70 291
>Winter: AEGIIRT K3 TAG +23 314
>Jason: EOQRUVX N5 EX +29 320
#note Tough choice and I pick one not on Championship Player's list. The plays with a 50+% win are OX at L10 and 7H.
>Winter: EEIIMRY B10 EYRIE +25 339
#note Winter pulled out his "Hollywooding" here, put it down, look at it, agonized; I knew he wanted a tell from me. I stayed frozen for what felt like a good 15 minutes going "25, hit your clock ... 25, hit your clock ... 25, hit your clock ..." Gratefully, he obliged.
>Jason: IOPQRUV A7 QUIP +51 371
>Winter: ABIILMS A12 ALBS +30 369
>Jason: IILOORV 14F OVOLI +20 391
#note Pretty basic endgame. Only win.
>Winter: IIMNOS H12 MO.N +27 396
#note OMI(t)S at 10H is one better.
>Jason: IR 13A ..RI +8 399
#note Missed RI(B) for two more. Not my best-played game, but I get the tournament off to a good start and fix my 0-2 record vs. Winter.
>Jason:  (IIS) +6 405
