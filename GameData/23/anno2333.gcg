#note Didn't even look for the bingo. Bad miss of VAGRANT.

#note This game kind of illustrates how far I've come since BAT. Played Eric at the early bird, at my nadir at 1560s, thinking "a mid-17s, gotta draw well and can't make any mistakes." I outdrew him, played well, and won. Here, though, no intimidation. I felt that if I drew decently and played solidly, I could win. Confidence is a funny thing...

#note Down Speedy's list, but Championship Player says it's best.

#note Missed/didn't know RIYAL at A1.
>Eric_Goldstein: DEIW A1 WIDE +35 151
>Jason: AEEFORS N9 EF +28 196
#note Should've played FOE at N12, but the pool's so consonant-heavy (13-31-2), I like the leave.
>Eric_Goldstein: ILV 3A ..VIL +18 169
>Jason: AELORSY 6B .Y +5 201
#note (EQUINE)LY, the 100-some point double-double I chickened out on vs. Mallick in my close loss in Albany, is a pretty cool play. Q doesn't like the fish, but I know the stem cold and most of its misses have been played.

#note Would've liked to get more than 63 for such a flexible rack.
>Eric_Goldstein: DEKOR 1D .ORKED +42 243
>Jason: EEPRSTZ H11 ZE.TS +45 309
#note Ooh, P(Y)E sets up ZEST at O12 for 78! Trying to turn over as much as I can to hit a blank.

#note I think my analysis here was solid; I considered JET at L7 to block but figured that, up 80 with the J, I could outrun the bingo.
>Eric_Goldstein: B 4D ..B +7 294
#note Hmm ... the presence of BBUU in the pool made me feel OK about his bingo-out prospects, but now that B is gone and I've just pulled UU.
>Jason: ?EIJTUU L7 JUT +14 381
#note I leave it up to the Tile Gods as I pick the only play that partially wins. JEsUIT is a guaranteed win; this wins five out of eight times. I just noticed another play that is a guaranteed win: JoE or JeE at 15A puts me up 104; most I get stuck with is 14 forcing him to find a 90-pointer on this board. The more I look at this, the more appalled I am that I didn't see/play JoE. Eric didn't have a lot of time (about 4:00 left), and I didn't want him looking for bingos on my time, but that's no excuse for rushing/totally mis-diagnosing the situation. Especially considering how bad I am at pre-endgames, I really should've taken my time here and thought it through. Very disappointed at this mistake.
>Eric_Goldstein: ?ABELNS O4 BENgALS +93 387
>Eric_Goldstein: ?ABELNS --  -93 294
#note I blocked BANGLES, no matter what was in the bag. Eric put down the LS at O9 and doubled the B, putting BE at O4, and I thought "Sh*t! BENgALS! I gave him a better spot; what a halfwit I am!" Then I thought "Wait, isn't it just BANGLES?" Somehow, despite having BE__ALS down, he didn't see it and picked it up. He counted LESBiAN at 2H as not enough, and his clock ticked under two minutes. Then he said "Oh!" I've made that sound before; I knew it wasn't good. Down goes BENgALS and I say "Challenge," as he neutralizes the clock/sighs in relief. "But it's good, right?" Eric said. I shrugged and as I was about to say "I'm not sure," Aaron Bader (playing Bradley Whitmarsh next to us) said "No, it's not." The challenge computer confirmed, and Eric was none too happy.
>Jason: ?EGIU I1 .UG +7 388
#note Missed the out of (G)IGUEs. Boy, I really didn't play as well as I thought I did this game. Plus, this doesn't block the out bingos like I thought it did. A tidy little 106-point mistake, pushing me over 200 (mostly from this and the VAGRANT miss).
>Eric_Goldstein: ?ABELNS O7 BELS +28 322
#note Didn't see S(U)BpANEL, thankfully. He went over by :57, but in the hubbub, I forgot to deduct the time penalty, so we agreed on 322 for him.
>Jason: ?EI 15A pIE +10 398
#note "You're going out, right?" Eric said. I nodded (although I could've played (L)IE at 13M for 16 and made him try to make a play, count it and hit the clock in three seconds, but that would've been jerky). Then he grabbed his handheld to look up the rack, saw NEBuLAS at 2H won, and told everybody within earshot. Really disappointing because he went through the alphabet, writing down all the bingoes, and put UNBALES down for the U, unable to remember the anagram. Tough way to lose; I thought he played a really good game. But in this game, sometimes it only takes one mistake. Besides, he shouldn't have had the chance if I'd played JoE like any non-idiot.
