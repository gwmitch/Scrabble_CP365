>Kelly_McKenzie: AT 8H AT +4 4
>Jason: AADFLOO 9G ALOOF +15 15
#note Sacrificed the three points of equity because of the potential comebacks. Hard for him to bingo for a lot coming back.

>Kelly_McKenzie: ACEINNS 10B CANINES +72 90

#note Ouch! QUADR(I)CS for 130!

>Kelly_McKenzie: BNU M13 NUB +18 133
>Jason: AAABEIU 8A BAA +20 170
#note Kelly correctly assumed that since I didn't play (O)BA at J9 to block the X-bomb that I was vowel-heavy.
>Kelly_McKenzie: MOO H12 .OOM +18 151
>Jason: ?ADEIUW 15M .UD +18 188
#note Gotta like the draw into AEIU. Considered Championship Player's choice of WUD at M9, but hated tempting fate by drawing into a no-consonant leave two turns in a row. Still, the pool is consonant-heavy enough I should be OK.
>Kelly_McKenzie: HY I12 .HY +27 178
>Jason: ?AEGIWY M9 WAY +20 208
>Kelly_McKenzie: ADIP 8L PAID +40 218
#note Yeah, I was afraid of that.
>Jason: ?EEGILO O1 ELOIGnE. +80 288
#note Only bingo.
>Kelly_McKenzie: X 10J X. +50 268
>Jason: IIRRTTV 2L VIR. +14 302
>Kelly_McKenzie: EKT M1 K.TE +16 284
>Jason: AILRRTT L2 .IRL +20 322
#note Yeah, I need to learn new words (Hey, they were both Speedy's picks, too!)
>Kelly_McKenzie: DEE K3 DEE +19 303
>Jason: AELNRTT 6F ANTLER +15 337
#note How could I resist playing ANTLER/(DEE)R? I liked this play. Four power tiles unseen, 13 in the bag, kills the -S bingo line. Not on Championship Player's radar, but it wins the sim.
>Kelly_McKenzie: EEIRSTZ 5B RESIZE +43 346
#note Ooh, wasn't anticipating that! Now I'm in trouble. However, there's a star play here: Championship player gives it a .5439 win percentage, above the second-best play at .3924 and this at .3295. Can you see it? Still, this is a nice play.
>Jason: EGHIIOT B1 GOIT.E +18 355
#note I thought I was dead until I saw that I had the case vowels. I probably took like 10 minutes with this play, debating between this and HIT at 4C. Championship player likes neither, picking GHI at 4G and GIE at J1 the plays that win 50% of the time. Sim says GHI wins 100% of the time. (P.S. Kelly could've played ZEST(E)R at J2 last turn.)
>Kelly_McKenzie: ?JNPRTW J2 JaW +39 385
#note Didn't see this. Beautiful play from Kelly, and for a moment I thought I'd lost. It explains why GHI is so good ... it blocks this.
>Jason: HIN C12 .HIN +18 373
#note We didn't recount, although nothing changed. I don't know why I thought I had Kelly beaten ... I didn't score 500! :) I will forever be Kelly McKenzie's first tournament tie.
>Jason:  (NPRT) +12 385
