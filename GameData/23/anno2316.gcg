>Rob: CDEGIST J5 CIG. +9 9
#note FIDGET D8 sims best.  CIGS, while leaving a workable rack, doesn't really contribute much to my bingoing next turn and doesn't score enough to validate it.
>Jim_Kramer: ABK 5H BA.K +24 108
>Rob: DEEEHST L5 SEETHED +75 84
#note SHEETFED is a word???

#note This is ominous...
>Rob: AEIIQRR 7C QI +26 164
#note FAQIR sims almost 19 points better than QI before adding the inference that Jim is holding a Y.  After that, QI sims 13.5 back.  However, the difference is almost certainly due to the average opponent score pushing down the spread after FAQIR, rather than any rationale for playing QI.  I honestly don't know why I didn't play it.

#note You know, maybe there's some value in studying...A. sixes...B. sixes that do not take S or otherwise form a seven...C. sixes that do not take S or otherwise form a seven and were just added to the dictionary.
>Rob: AENNTUU H10 A.TUNE +21 212
#note UNTUNE N1 sims better, but I'm not sure that I like it.  There are a lot of cheap 30-40 point responses that Jim could answer with.  I don't abhor the UN- leave, nor do I dislike the forked board in this position.

>Rob: ?ABFNOU 3F tU.BOFAN +82 294
>Jim_Kramer: AEOPS N1 PASEO +27 271
>Rob: ?AGTTUU O1 AG +24 318
#note If we can forget for a moment that TAUTAUGS doesn't exist, AG doesn't sim too much worse than GUTTA 2B.  UU is terrible, yes, but so would be ZAPS.  Maybe I was too impressed with his XI setup from earlier in the game...unless he left AS or SZ after PASEO, it seems like too far-fetched a fish to be going for.
>Jim_Kramer: AGLLO 10A GALLO. +11 282
>Rob: ?DOTTUU A8 DU.OUT +27 345
#note I saw aUTOTUNED, which I was 99% sure was phony, and OUTTUrNED, which I was about 50/50 on.  After the game, Jim said that he thought it was good, though I forgot to ask him if he would have challenged it.  OUTTURN is a noun.
>Jim_Kramer: INW 2J WIN +34 316
>Rob: ?DORSTZ 13G D.. +9 354
#note Fishing for SpRITZ 14A.  Any play involving one tile wins with perfect play.  ZA 1G blocks INERTIAE and INTERWAR, Jim's only possible bingos.  It could also induce him to fish for RETINENES, leading to a lower opponent score and giving me DETHRONES, SHORTENED, or MODERNEST with an E.
>Jim_Kramer: EEIINRT 1B INERTI.E +59 375
>Rob: ?ORRSTZ C9 Z.OTyS +48 402
#note I thought ZlOTYS C9 was a cute way to seal the victory, but there's an all-star way to do so that I missed.  Still, a win is a win.
>Jim_Kramer: W 14H ..W +14 389
#note After I played SEETHED, I thought of SILVERBACKS.  I don't know that my train of thought would have ever taken me to RAZORBACKS.
