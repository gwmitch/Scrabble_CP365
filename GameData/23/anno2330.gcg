#note or QUANGO. I thought there was a chance he might challenge QUONDAM, and I think it's better anyway.

#note not good at all. GYRON is the same thing, only way better.

#note oops, didn't know CRINUM was good. this still sucks. even plain old TIC is better.

#note yep, I saw INCRuST and passed it up 'cause it didn't quite look right. ugh. believe it or not, it's actually just barely better than not bingoing. however, this time I should've followed my insticts and just fished off the C for ACHE. really not my best moment.
