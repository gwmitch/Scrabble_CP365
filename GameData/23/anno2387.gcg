#note Some close options here. I looked at TUNNEL 8J and UNCLE 10B, setting up the N hook. NURL comes out on top.

>Carl: ABEINRU 8J .URBAN +27 182
#note TERBIA does a little better. BUN 15A wins the sim, probably because it keeps the board closed.

>Trip_P: INOSZ O11 SOZIN +56 278
#note This was a nightmare. When SOZIN fell, I could be reasonably certain that I would lose this game. I would spend the entire second half struggling in vain to open the board. Agony.
>Carl: AEHIMNS N14 HI +22 250
#note I also looked at HM, the sim winner. I thought it was more important to take out the Q spot. Even though it paid off, I should have left it open so I could use it myself; I'm the one that needs it.

#note Quackle puts this 10 points below EIDE H6. I wouldn't ever in a million years do that. I actually considered NIDE H6 instead, setting up the S hook. I wanted to open the board and I didn't like blocking column H and the potential longshot -SIDE bingos. Something like PLANESIDE isn't too unreasonable drawing to AEENS.

#note Trip had seven consonants here and couldn't block the lane I set up.
>Carl: AACDORS N3 CODA +14 302
#note What do you do here? Quackle tells me I'm giving up 16 points over AD 15E. I think that's way too harsh. I wanted an extra lane seeing as he's likely to block row 5 with something down column I. Although the C isn't an optimal tile to play through in that position, I liked the fact that he cannot possibly block all lanes without opening one.
>Trip_P: EGLLU 5I GULLE. +16 374
>Carl: ?ANPPRS -  +0 302
#note This is an obligatory challenge. I didn't know the word, for one thing, and it blocked what would have been the best POSSIBLE 2x2 I could have drawn among all the unseen tiles! It's game over if it's good. If I let it stay, there is nothing I can set up that he cannot block.

#note I missed RiP(R)APS 4B. That would have been fun.
>Trip_P: AETT F1 TATE +8 392
#note Had he played TEAT F2 instead, he would have finished in 12th place, and I in 13th. But who's counting?
