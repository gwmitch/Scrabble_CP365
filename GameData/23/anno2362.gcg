#note I'm not gonna bother talking about this play too much. If you know me at all, then you know how anal I am about opening plays that leave vowels next to DLS's- I never do it. Also, for 22 more points, I risk a monster counterplay if he has an s- BRULZIES alone is 57, plus whatever word he extends it to (he said he had FOINS for 90).

#note Sims best above the stylish BYROAD that I didn't see.
>Sam_Rosin: CEGIOQR H4 CIRQ.E +20 125
>Phil: AENPRRS I1 RAP +22 155
#note Although it sims best, Sam thought it was bad (without knowing my rack).
>Sam_Rosin: EEGJNOS 1F JEE. +33 158
>Phil: EINNRSV -NV +0 155
#note I guess I would've played FANE 6J if I saw it. Quackle's top choices all involve dumping the N for 6,4,3 or 2 points. I figured I'd let him open the board for me. This was a slight mistake, but after all, these plays barely score anything.
>Sam_Rosin: DGLNOSU 10H SLUG +25 183
#note I like this play given Phil's exchange last turn. SUNDOG 10H might be better, but I didn't know it. I felt vindicated when he said his rack was LINTERS after the exchange.
>Phil: EILNRST F1 .IN +12 167
#note Again, Quackle likes FANE or El H1...I'm not just gonna sit here taking 4 points each turn; I wanted to take the 12 points here and hopefully not let Sam blow open his lead.

#note The sim likes NOWT 11J very slightly better. 
>Phil: AGIIOST 11K OI +10 272
#note Didn't think this play was so bad at the time. GIGOT K10 sims best, which I don't know. I actually don't like the leave of AIS for only 14 points though. GIGA sims next best; again, IOST is shaky for 12 points. I really don't mind OI here- a good leave and scoring basically the same as GIGOT/GIGA.
>Sam_Rosin: AAAENTW B4 .AW +31 296
>Phil: AGIKSTU 5K .U.K +8 280
#note Runner up, two val points behind IKAT 12I. I didn't see IKAT, honestly. However, LUNK sets up the case S nicely, while leaving a somewhat bingo-prone leave.
>Sam_Rosin: AADENOT 6M .AT +12 308
#note Best with the inference of the S
>Phil: ADGIOST 12J GOD +20 300
#note Best, despite Sam calling it "weird"
>Sam_Rosin: ADEFHNO O6 .HO +18 326
>Phil: AEISTWY F8 .AY +16 316
#note After 2500 iterations, Q likes BAWTY best, leaving EIS. The problem is that there are 7/16 vowels in the bag so a bad draw loses me the game here. BAY's leave allows me to score regardless of what I draw. REI sims second best at 5D; I think I like that best.
>Sam_Rosin: ADEFGIN N1 IF +20 346
#note Both Championship Player and simulation seem to favor FIG B13, a counterintuitive play that looks very good upon analysis. There isn't anything Phil can do with the TWS after it, it blocks off the MAUVES hook, and I keep a strong leave.
>Phil: EEISTTW 5D .EI +22 338
#note Apparently WEET 13B wins 3% more (30% vs. 27%)
>Sam_Rosin: ADEEGIN C3 G. +6 352
#note Champ. Player's favorite is USE 11C, with a win% of 90.3%, and this play doesn't even show up on its choices. It rises right near the top upon many-ply simulation, though I think that's really unreliable. Anyway, my feeling was that I was giving myself a 40% chance to draw a T and win the game outright with DETAINEE 13B. I didn't really consider just playing the E with USE, though I did think about ED E11. Any suggestions? I find that pre-endgame play is one of my weakest points.
>Phil: EESTTTW 1N .T +6 344
#note Champ likes WE 13B!!! With AEE unseen of 9, he's guaranteed to have the ability to hook onto WE for a bunch of points- I think this is stupid. Sure, IT doesn't score well, but it doesn't empty the bag. I guess TET 2B is better, but other than that, this play wasn't as bad as it looks.
>Sam_Rosin: ADEEINX 2B DEX +26 378
#note This wins 100% of the time, though DEX D13 is Champ's top pick.
>Phil: EEMSTTW 1A WE +18 362
#note Should've played WEST here; I didn't see his outplays (I know the word TENIA, but not ENTIA). Either way, I lose.
>Sam_Rosin: AEINT E11 ENTIA +16 394
