>Linda_Hoggatt: AKNPS H8 SPANK +32 32
#note In honor of Steve, she put down KNAPS, then played this. Without knowing the leave, I prefer KNAPS; this gives up -S hooks and extensions like (SPANK)ING.
>Jason: FLMNNQS -FLMNQ +0 0
>Linda_Hoggatt: DMNNOUU 8A UNMOUND. +86 118
>Linda_Hoggatt: DMNNOUU --  -86 32
#note Ugly rack, ugly word, scored a bunch ... didn't take me too long to challenge.
>Jason: INORSTV -V +0 0
#note Uh oh ... I better hit or the six-zero rule could come into play...
>Linda_Hoggatt: DMNNOUU 11E MOU.D +16 48
#note Speedy likes MUON at G7.
>Jason: INNORST 13B INTRONS +78 78
>Linda_Hoggatt: INNOU 10B UNION +17 65
#note Put down UNO(I)N* at B10 before realizing her mistake. Before this round, Jeff was talking about how he played PENN(A)NT (maybe even keeping an N) and how it reminded him of my parody "It's Raining N's." Exhibit B: 21 tiles played, five N's, and I've got the case one. It's raining N's!
>Jason: AEGNTUV G4 VAGUE +12 90
#note Missed the star play of VAU at G7 for 18. Picked up VUG(S) to play this ... Q prefers the former.
>Linda_Hoggatt: AA F5 AA +11 76
>Jason: EEIINRT 8A NITERI.. +27 117
#note One of the things I was proud of from this tournament is that I was willing to break up good racks like this when the situation called for it. Q agrees here.
>Linda_Hoggatt: DE 11E .....ED +22 98
#note Linda had beaten Winter by seven the round prior, but she'd made a mistake on the results slip, writing the same score for her and her opponent. She was worried about it, but I told her not to worry if the rest of it (including both spreads) were correct. Still, she waited for Winter to come back so he'd agree to change it ... but he never did. Since he was 0-3, we were worried he just up and left, but it was a simple honest mistake over when lunch was. Anyway, Linda was upset that she did or said something and I stupidly said something here like "Congratulations, you made Winter quit Scrabble!" when she felt badly enough.
>Jason: EHIPSVX 14E EX +52 169
#note My turnover is rewarded.
>Linda_Hoggatt: CORSW 15A CROWS +45 143
>Jason: HILMPSV 10J HIP +32 201
#note Championship player says HIM is slightly better.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ABIO 12A OBIA +24 167
>Jason: BLMOSTV E3 MOB +24 225
#note Close. TOMB is Speedy's pick.
>Linda_Hoggatt: AJR D2 RAJ +42 209
#note Whacked for my mistake.
>Jason: LOQSTVW 9K VOW +24 249
#note A little risky, but there's only one O and U left, there's no guarantee she has the C or F for 8L ...
>Linda_Hoggatt: ACDLO 8K ACOLD +56 265
#note Ow. And she's turning over five with both blanks out.
>Jason: AEILQST C1 QAT +36 285
#note Missed QI at F2, same score and a better leave.
>Linda_Hoggatt: EI 4G .IE +7 272
>Jason: EEEILSY 7M YE +24 309
#note An easier play to make given her last play.
>Linda_Hoggatt: FU I3 F.U +10 282
#note Odd ... why close the line you just opened?
>Jason: EEEILLS O8 .ELE +5 314
#note "Brat," Linda said as I put this down. Dallas walked by doing "live coverage" stuff, and I asked if he heard that.
>Linda_Hoggatt: ?AEGILR A2 dRAGLI.E +59 341
#note ALLERGIN's the only one ending in N. This was my hope, that she'd bingo for nothing, but I'm still behind and without endgame tempo. Maybe DELE wasn't the play.
>Jason: EGHILSZ 12L ZIGS +37 351
#note Championship Player says it's best, 40.91% win. GHIS, same spot, is 40.15% and (U)GH at 5I is 35.61%.
>Linda_Hoggatt: EFRTTTY J10 ..FTY +22 363
#note Wow, Linda has a tie here! Can you see it?
>Jason: ?DEEHL 3I .LEsHED +26 377
#note To answer the question: (F)RETTY leads to my HEaD at 13J and her (E)FT at K3 would be 381-381. Nearly missed this ... and it's the only win. Lucky she kept ?DE in the bag. Another exciting game; off to lunch 3.5-.5, +68.
>Jason:  (ERTT) +8 385
