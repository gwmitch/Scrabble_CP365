#note my first legitimately bad move of the game. ALLOY is clearly better, and I'm not sure why I missed it.

>Magrathean: ABCIKOU 10I KOB +25 328
#note even a great draw barely makes this rack legitimate, and I decide to make another lame move. I saw BUCKO at the top but not below, where it scores nicely without giving anything back.

#note uhoh
>Magrathean: HHIUUVW -HHIUUVW +0 374
#note in turn, I have one of the least timely draws I have ever had, when most decent draws will probably lead to me winning. I compound it by making my third mistake in the last few moves and throwing them all back. I couldn't see how any one of them would help me win the game, but quackle has a fascinating answer - keep HW! I don't think I've ever seen a position like this before, but it makes lots of sense - there aren't that many scoring tiles left out, and it may allow me to stay ahead of him with scoring plays. what a great position.

>Magrathean: AEIILMN M1 AIM +20 394
#note yet another conundrum! John has a knack for making scrabble hard for his opponents. I don't know how useful quackle is here, but it seems to like either MINE or MINA underneath. that doesn't seem right to me, though, because TAE pretty clearly suggests that he has the blank, in which case the open T has to be respected. There's also the idea of fishing off the I at B6, but that just allows him to beat me too easily with scoring plays. I'm very much unsure of what to do here.
>John_O'Laughlin: MU F2 MU. +11 368
>Magrathean: EEILNVW H1 VIN. +21 415
#note This looks pretty damn good for me. The only two bingos in the pool are EVANISH and INHUMANE. At the time I didn't see either of these, and I certainly didn't even look at 13E once. His odds of having either of those are 1/18, but EVANISH is unblockable, which means that had I considered the possiblity of EVANISH I would've had to leave one in the bag. Even so I think there's no way I can beat him if he has that. VINO takes care at least of some of the bingo threats, leaves tiles that can score, and leaves me up by 45. A much better way of doing the same thing is just to play INWOVE - I wanted to hold onto the W so I could hot WE at the bottom right, but INWOVE offers a great prospect of going out next turn. No play wins all the endgames, but INWOVE looks like the best try by a fair amount, losing no endgames but the ones where John has EVANISH. however, VINO is bad because it allows one other draw to beat me - UV, in which case he has VESUVIAN!! knowing john, I think he could've found it, too.
>John_O'Laughlin: ?AEINUV 13E EVANIsH +71 439
#note unfortunately for me, he did have EVANIsH. Even assuming that he had AEIN? when he played MU (which he did) there's still only a 1/3 chance that he has EVANISH. well done to john for giving himself the chance.
