#note PROAS is probably better, in terms of blocking up the triple lane a little more, and there's no need to be stingy with the S on this board, with 2 let. i also wasn't tracking.

#note again, Quackle hates it. i wanted to take out the scoring possibilities with the Q, retain my high point tile, and get to the bottom of the bag.  OHIA H3 sims better, but i hate to give away the triple lane for an easy plural four.
