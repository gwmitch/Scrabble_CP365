#note "Here we go again," I think, then reminded myself to keep fighting. P.S. OUT(W)ILEs or OUT(W)ILEd are the highest-scoring bingos, each 72. Only TOLUIdE's 67 (one spot up) is more.

#note I took like 12 minutes this game, half on this move. Looking for cool multiple overlaps along row 14 or column L, even a 10 through HIN. Somehow, I pick Championship Player's choice.
>Steve_Krieger: EORTV 4C OVERT... +28 234
>Jason: EEFIMPR 15L FREE +46 228
#note Equity loss through five turns: 0.
>Steve_Krieger: BGMOU 15D GUMBO +39 273
>Jason: AILMNPX 14A ALP +27 255
#note Missed (U)NMIX. Not sure Why I didn't play PAX or PIX at 13M.
>Steve_Krieger: ADDEIT E2 ID.ATED +18 291
>Jason: AEIIMNX 8A MIXE. +48 303
#note This or EXAMIN(ER) at M8. Both of us are racing to the unseen KS. "That wasn't very smart," Steve said after I played this. Indeed, if he keeps the D, I probably miss (U)NMIX and EXAMIN(ER) and then what?
>Steve_Krieger: AGRV M10 GRAV.. +20 311
>Jason: AHIKNNS K4 KA +35 338
#note Yahtzee! Duck (OVERTHINK)ING and I'm golden.
>Steve_Krieger: FUZ 6C FU.Z +36 347
#note Now, if you're Steve, do you assume I've got the S? Can I play OVERTHINK without the S at the ready? In short, is he obligated to make some kind of blocking play from the P, off of NA? I tend to say yes.
>Jason: EHINNST L1 HINS +62 400
#note Missed SHENT for 71.  "Too much to overcome," Steve said. "Yeah, but I've seen this movie before," I said. "I always die in the end."
>Steve_Krieger: CGOY 2B YOG.C +34 381
>Jason: BENNOOT 13G NEB +18 418
#note Down the Duck's list. Despite what it gives up, (P)O(I)NTE, leaving NOB at 1A as an out, is best.
>Steve_Krieger: AACEIOR 1K C.AIR +30 411
>Jason: NOOT L6 ONTO +14 432
#note Wow. What a fun, fun game. First time I can remember a game of mine having a ten on it. "Give me eight power tiles and I can beat you," I said. Actually, nine, since the K was practically a power tile in this one. Like last year, after one day of the Burning River Blowout, I lead by 1/2 a game.
