>Carl: AKNQUUY 8D QUAKY +62 62
>Bing: DEIINRV 9C VINE +26 26
#note Sometimes, it sucks to be going second. I think this play was fine, though INDIE 9D is a nice alternative.
>Carl: AGNNUUZ H4 GAUZ. +20 82
#note CJ: Exch. GNUU is a slight favorite over GAUZY.
>Bing: ?DHILLR 5G H.LLIaRD +72 98
#note If Carl had opted to exchange, I'd have had an interesting decision. I think I would have settled for HILLY rather than HYDRILLa H7.
>Carl: FIJNNUW N5 .JIN +28 110
#note CJ: My strategy here was to score well and set up a strong F play next turn down column O. Or, if you use the lane, I can fall back on FaWN L4. I don't really understand how FUNDI N2 sims so much better.
#note I guess this is another illustration of just how toxic the WU combination can be to a rack - you really have to clear one of them if at all possible. If not FUNDI, maybe JAW L4.
>Bing: EMOOPRS O8 OOSPERM +92 190
#note Inferring / praying that Carl didn't have an S after the last move.
>Carl: EFHMNUW N12 FEH +39 149
#note CJ: Another close call, but the sim favors WHUMP 11K or FANUM L4.
>Bing: ?EIRRTY J5 .ITERaRY +62 252
#note The only bingo.
>Carl: DEMNOUW E8 ..WOUND +22 171
#note CJ: I looked at MOW M7, which wins by about 2 points, but I was tired of hanging onto that U.
>Bing: ABEELNO K10 BEANO +26 278
>Carl: EMOPSUV O1 MOVES +45 216
#note CJ: Not even close. POEM L12, keeping the wretched SUV leave, wins the sim handily.
>Bing: ACEEELO C9 .ELOCE +22 300
>Carl: ACEFIPU 4F FU. +12 228
#note CJ: Trying to set up some Hail Mary lanes in case I draw a D. PFUI I12 is better by 12 points.
>Bing: AAEIRTX L12 RAX +43 343
>Carl: ABCEIIP J14 BI +28 256
>Bing: AEISTTT 15G TIT. +12 355
>Carl: ACEGIPW B10 WAG +33 289
>Bing: AENRSTT A6 TETRA +21 376
#note A tough decision...obviously I didn't want to break up the superb rack, but my lead wasn't quite enough that I thought I could ignore the triple. That pesky -ED ending line was also a worry. I wasn't entirely confident of my choice, but TETRA does in fact sim best.  
>Carl: ACEIIPT A12 EPIC +32 321
>Bing: DEELNOS 3E NOD +20 396
#note I thought this was sewing up the win, but I didn't quite think it through enough. If I had left the I in the bag, Carl could have pulled out a stunning victory.
