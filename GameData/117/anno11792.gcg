>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AAEIILT 7H AALII +14 14
#note The sim gives the edge to fishing with 7I AI. I considered it, but it seemed so likely he would play atop it in response, killing all bingo lanes. Lots of plays are close here. I don't hate AALII.

#note Ugh. Facepalm moment here. I missed J(O)HN, which I would definitely prefer here. JIVER is ugly.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: AILOSST 15D O.ALISTS +77 301
#note Yeah that doesn't happen after JOHN.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: HINOPSU B10 PU.IN +26 301
#note I wasn't a fan of this play, but there isn't much better. I missed 14A OUPHE, which I would probably prefer.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IINOOSY N1 OY +25 351
#note I'm not sure what to do with the knowledge that Q, X (seen on courtesy draw throwback), and probably ? are still in the bag. I can do well with any of those tiles, but I can't reasonably go for turnover here. I missed the scoring play 14B NOSEY, but I'm not sure if I don't like OY better anyways.
>Jeremy_Hildebrand: CEEMRTW 5B CERMET +27 342
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?IINOST B1 TONI.S +20 371
#note Shrug? I can't see any big plays that this gives up. Most of the time I draw outs or a big Q or X play. Seems fine? Is it?

#note Okay game. My board vision was clearly not all there (missing JOHN and OUPHE), but no critical errors.
