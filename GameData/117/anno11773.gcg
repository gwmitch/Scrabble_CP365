#note Man, I was a mess today. I was like, oh AADGINR doesn't bingo, better trade the D. REALLY?

#note Thought it might be Collins (it's not), and JD has a checkered high-prob history versus me. UNDERNS# though lol.
>Jesse_Day: AGHIV E2 HAVI.G +26 155
>dacrON: CEEIINS D10 ICE +22 162
#note I figured JD would know CRETINOID didn't take the S in TWL. I happened to know CRETINOIDS#. This ultimately backfired, as he had no idea it was #-only.

>dacrON: AEIMRRS 3H MARRIES +74 272
#note Tried to get a read here (didn't get any reaction) by putting it down at 3H first, but it was just too volatile.

#note BAWDY in the same spot, duh.

>Jesse_Day: AEF 4L FA.E +28 330
#note I think this was the play where Jesse was about to try HAVINGS#. Neither of us knew it, but it's good!
>dacrON: BELTTTY F10 B.TTY +24 382
>dacrON: AEIJLOT (challenge) +5 387
#note Thought I was good to go here, except...
>Jesse_Day: AZ 7M Z.A +56 386
#note Ouch.
>dacrON: AEIJLOT 14B JOLT. +30 417
#note I like this because there is only one A left.
>Jesse_Day: BLLU 3A BULL. +16 402
>dacrON: ?AEEITV A3 .EhAVE +33 450
#note (B)rEVIATE# and Eq(U)ATIVE# sounded familiar, but I wasn't about to risk it here. VI(B)E also wins, but I didn't really like the uncertainty, in case I was missing something with the U. Pretty sure this play wins 100%.

>Jesse_Day: ?DEHISU M7 ...ES +34 436
#note In a backhanded way, knowing that CRETINOIDS was #-only was nice here.
>dacrON: AEIT 15A TAE +20 470
#note I knew I'd win after an AE draw, which left me no outplay, so I knew I was good once I drew it.
