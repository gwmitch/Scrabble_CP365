#note Why is this so low on the list? I like this slightly better than ACRS.
>Tina_Friend: ?AEFIN G5 FAN.IEd +13 13
#note This literally made me sad inside ;) but seriously why would you use the blank for THIS? I bet she had a bingo and it was overlooked. Well, it is true she hasn't played a tournament since '86... Maybe that's a factor? I don't know.
>Avery_Mojica: ABEGKRS 6F K.B +19 31
#note I really overlooked BRAKE H1? Stupid (facepalm). Guess I'm so intent on a bingo.
>Tina_Friend: DFN 10F F.ND +16 29
#note She was originally going to play FEND at F10 down, which showed me her E. And she played this. I'm baffled at this point. Honestly.
>Avery_Mojica: AAEGRST H4 GA. +13 44
#note I got the best nonbingo play. I guess in the back of my head I knew TEARGAS and GASTREA. I should have found them though.
>Tina_Friend: EES J10 SEE +16 45
#note ...and an S disappears.
>Avery_Mojica: AAEERST J2 AERATES +68 112
#note For some reason, SEER didn't look right to me. But I found it.
>Tina_Friend: HOT K5 HOT +26 71
>Avery_Mojica: AEHILSS I3 HA +22 134
#note Again, best nonbingo play. Didn't know SHEILAS. Not even in the back of my mind.
>Tina_Friend: MOOZ 13G ZOOM +32 103
>Avery_Mojica: AEILSSV H12 V.LE +33 167
#note Scored as 30. Grr.
>Tina_Friend: EMOT 11J .MOTE +14 117
#note Quackle agrees that this should have been played one spot down. That O is dangerous to leave open. Fine by me though, at least it doesn't waste a blank.
>Avery_Mojica: ADILSSW N10 W.LDS +34 201
#note This didn't even make it on the list. I see why. Stupid me. I guess now I start to get tired. Maybe not. I see many better plays. Do you? They're easy finds... Swail, wadi, etc. >.<
>Tina_Friend: ELNO O7 LONE +17 134
>Avery_Mojica: AEIISWY 14F WA.Y +34 235
#note Blanked on playing it at 12L. Already forgot about the spot. Wow. Am I tired or what?
>Tina_Friend: ?OR 15E ROp. +19 153
#note O_O ANOTHER BLANK??? *heart faints at depression*
>Avery_Mojica: DEIINSU L3 DUI +14 249
#note Not getting close to a bingo... Need better stuff than this. Maybe I can use her ROPE to get a hook.
>Tina_Friend: AR 12J .AR +14 167
>Avery_Mojica: EIINOSX O14 OX +29 278
#note Scored as 31.
>Tina_Friend: AP 11E PA. +13 180
>Avery_Mojica: EIINRSU 3L .UI +8 286
#note Same word can't hurt twice I guess. Good dumping word.
>Tina_Friend: IT 2N TI +8 188
>Avery_Mojica: EEINNRS 13L EN. +11 297
>Tina_Friend: BCEU 12B CUBE +20 208
>Avery_Mojica: EIINRST I8 .I. +6 303
#note Didn't want to play at 7F yet.
>Tina_Friend: EIT B12 .ITE +12 220
>Avery_Mojica: EILNRST A13 LIN +19 322
#note Don't need her getting lucky on the triple. But seeing what she's done so far, I don't see much harm coming.
>Tina_Friend: Q O1 Q. +33 253
#note There's that...
>Avery_Mojica: ENORSTY 13A ..TER +23 345
#note This is really low. I see why, but I don't know where I'm supposed to bingo.
>Tina_Friend: GIPRRUV L10 G... +5 258
#note She missed a lot. But it's not an easy rack.
>Avery_Mojica: GIJNOSY C11 J.. +10 355
#note I played this rushedly since she was at less than 30 seconds, and she takes a while with plays. All the better for my spread, which isn't the best right now.
>Tina_Friend: IPRRUV 4N PI +10 268
#note Still missing the 16 point play. Can you find it? It's not playable after this turn.
>Avery_Mojica: GINOSY 7E YI. +12 367
#note Again, if I would have had more time, would have found better plays. Like YOGIN.
>Tina_Friend: RRUV L10 ....R +6 274
>Tina_Friend: RRUV --  -6 268
#note Yeah, nice try. I can still challenge.
>Avery_Mojica: GNOS 8D GO +10 377
#note Trying to maximize my points here.
>Tina_Friend: RRUV 2J .R +2 270
>Avery_Mojica: NS C11 ...S +14 391
>Tina_Friend: RUV D8 .UV +7 277
#note Forgot she could dump there.
>Avery_Mojica: N E7 ..N +8 399
#note Still broke 400 on my sheet. Scored as 9. Reached 402 and subtracted 10 from her side for overtime.
>Avery_Mojica:  (R) +2 401
