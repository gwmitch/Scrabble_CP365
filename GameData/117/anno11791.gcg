#note C-Player likes just dumping the Z at I7 for 21. About an 8-point error in valuation, 40-32. Patzer said to have a 50 percent chance of winning, Z(A) 54.
>Joe_South: VW I7 V.W +17 167
>Steve: CDNOTUV 12J C.UD. +16 186
#note Best is ROVED, then DROVE, then TRUCED. Getting rid of the V probably main reason.

>Steve: EFNORTV 5M FO. +25 211
#note Second-best to....OVERGLAD!!!

#note Unsuccessful challenge. Looked familiar, but felt I couldn't take the chance of it being NG.
>Joe_South: HU F5 UH +28 361
>Steve: EFJNORS 10F JOES +37 312
#note This scores the most, but E4 JO said to be best. Last turn, 6F JIN would have been best.
>Joe_South: ACHIT E3 AITCH +34 395
>Steve: BFNRRRT -BFNRR +0 312
#note 3C FR(A)T(E)R is best, and exchanging isn't close.
