#note Pretty weak. I don't think I've ever seen MYOPY, but that looks like a pretty good play here.  And I somehow blanked on the obvious WYN.

#note Big facepalm on missing INWOVE for 6 more points. Not a huge error, I guess, but annoying because it should have been obvious.

#note This is a tough position. The bag is super vowel-heavy, so I am really nervous about my leave here. But I was also nervous about leaving that S open. Am I too paranoid about that? If he has the blank at this point, I am in big trouble whether he bingos or not. Can I continue to assume I can bank the Z at any time? The sim winner is ICON, beating this by 8 points or so. Yeah, COZ is silly. It assumes he has the blank, but then gives him the COZy hook if he does have it. So no, don't do COZ.

#note Debated between this and FOVEAE. I guess the idea is that two triples are open for scoring after FOVEAE, and he probably can't do too well with either. Killing the E is the big thing, here. Yeah, this might be another mistake. Still unsure. I like keeping the F as the last scoring tile.
