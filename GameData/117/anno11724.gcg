#note Sim prefers SNOG and ARGOSY over this, which is a little weird. But they're really all close equity-wise

#note Oh, didn't see M1 RAWISH. This is good anyways

#note Unfortunately there is no elegant way to open the board here. M1 ORRIS is pretty silly. So I really don't know what is best here. But M2 SRIS wins the sim. Yick.

#note Damn, I missed the right play. M3 ROSE to fork the board. Crucial at this point
>Alyssa_Faria: CEILM M9 CLIME +32 153
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?DEEIRS 12F E. +2 117
#note I figured she may not have the right tiles to block. A FQVZ would do the trick. Or the S.

#note I passed up SENHORA because it gave too much back, and it felt too soon to panic. But that's wrong. It is totally a good time to panic. I flat out missed SERAPHIN which I definitely would have played. Really spazzing here.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ENNRSZ J2 ZER. +33 204
#note Saw N2 ZIN but really felt I needed another bingo lane. Although the leave is weak. Mistake, probably.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ENOSTY B10 YO +34 242
#note Timely block. Now I am really freaking out. YON is clearly better because of the unseen N's. I was just feeling snakebit on my draws.
>Alyssa_Faria: INPT A7 PINT +24 278
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EMNSST 13M .M +4 246
#note And there it is. I missed STEMSON. That very likely wins, because the blank was still in the bag at this point. Don't asked what EM was all about. I was completely out of my mind at this point. I think I was hoping to distract her from the bingo line or something.
