#note RATEABLE avoids the hot spot, but I didn't know if it took an S, so I decided to pass on it. It doesn't take an S, despite RATABLES. Shrug?

#note I can't block SHEAVING without giving him SHAVING. This gives him a big SHOVING, but forces him to burn his good tiles. Plus I thought he might try HOVING*.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: GINNPTW G7 P.WING +19 158
#note I didn't think this was good, but I thought I could probably get away with it. And I just didn't see anything better. LAPWING is bettter, but I don't know it.
>Sean_Baizana: AW F6 WA. +36 120
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: LNORSTU C2 TURNS +31 189
#note Ugh... silly brainfart whiffing on LUNTS in the same spot. Sim actually gives the edge to LUNT, but I didn't value the S too highly on this board.
>Sean_Baizana: CCEEOR H2 COERCE. +18 138
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EEEILO 12F O.EE +9 198
#note Sim likes 14A OE. I thought I wanted to open the board with the blank in hand. But... just take the extra 7 pts I guess?

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EILLNT 2H .LIENTaL +72 270
#note Didn't want to open the 3x3, but I felt safe with BOO on his rack. I would have taken pLOTLINE if I had seen it, though.
