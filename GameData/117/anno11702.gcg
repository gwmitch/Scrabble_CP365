#note It is a good day at Austin Scrabble Club.

It rained recently and later it got too chilly in the room, but for now it is fine.

I'm trying to do a new diet to eliminate Candida and provide more Vitamin A.  It's low glycerides or something.  Kimchee and no starches.  Slept well at first but not sleeping too well the last couple days.  The idea is to make my brain work better.  This eve. I'm in a cheerful mood, but apparently not too strong mentally, as we'll see.

Computer evaluations here are from Quackle 0.97, usually from Championship Player.

This is a bad first rack and my choice to keep CIN is not best.  Exchange keeping CINO is better. Playing UNCI to HAJI is not much worse, keeping IOU.

#note Obviously I was trying to play with the board upside-down, a skill I've recently started to develop, due to square boards and small tables.  Have to be ready for all conditions.  If Tony doesn't challenge it for some reason then it beats all the non-phony choices.

At the end the last game (there are three games) I made a bad mistake too.  So that added some nice symmetry to the evening.  Started with a mistake, lost, won the second game, almost won the third game, ended with a mistake.

>Leeds: BCGINTX H7 B.TING +11 11
#note Quackle says best is C(A)B for 7 - leave is GINTX or NI(G)HT for 12 - leave is BCX or BING(E) - leave is CTX.  I did not even consider looking for plays that seem so mediocre! I went for some turnover.

B(A)TING is only 1 point worse.  

I didn't think of extensions whatsoever, only a front A hook (which I later forgot about, since in my mind I assumed it would be used for a bingo).

#note Quackle says ZA  or ZED with (FE)Z are better, but not by much.

>Tony_Cook: OTY 13K TOY +19 138
>Leeds: ACDEOOX L1 CO.E +22 79
#note Tony blocked CODEX.  I think I got fixated on getting a big score with the X.  I was tempted to play CO(O)ED.  Quackle is informing me that I am foolish here not to play COXA or otherwise use the X.  To keep the AXO was a last second decision based on my wanting the A for (C)OAX in case I failed to draw any usable tiles for the X.  (That is probably why I should have just used the X, but apparently I was not being very logical.)


>Tony_Cook: ABOUY N10 BAYOU +39 177
>Leeds: ADOORTX 1L .OAX +39 118
#note It would have been cool to find OX(C)ART.
I think I failed to notice OXO would hook BO, or I would have played OXO on the tripleword.
I started to play (V)OX and decided I want to give away those easy 16 points.

>Tony_Cook: ACER O7 CARE +22 199
>Leeds: DGIIORT M6 TRIGO +14 132
#note I started to play DI(V)OT and picked it up because Tony must have an S by now, and I didn't.  Again, went for a little more turnover instead, and I figured the board would be more open for bingos this way if I did ever get close to a bingo rack.

Ha! I am correct, TRIGO is Quackle's favorite (albeit I'm using Quackle in a way that's not thoroughly thorough.)

The four Ss and two blanks are still unseen by me.

>Leeds: DILLOWW 14F WILL +17 149
#note Still trying to keep the main part of the board open.
Quackle says I made a good choice, but my Bogowin estimated win percentage is only 0.16 (not sixteen percent, but less than 1 percent!) which is very small now. Also I am 149 points behind.  This time, it's not about to start getting better.



>Tony_Cook: OOO -OOO +0 281
>Leeds: DDINORW 4I DO.. +8 157
#note Now Quackle does not like my play at all and says I should have done (Z)OR(I) or WI(Z) or WI(T) or DI(T) or DROWN(D) instead.  At this point it really matters very little!  

I do not think that I cheated, but it's conceivable I could have seen Tony's eye gleaming at the BATING extension, or showing some interest when I started to look at the line there.  

I do not mean to cheat by reading people's eyes but it can happen intuitively.  This is a reason to wear a hat in division 2, or develop a technique like using a board diagram, or like looking at the board in a planned pattern when it's the other person's turn.  If you don't watch your opp. too much then your opp. can't notice how you watch her.  Poker face is a fairly essential skill that Quackle can not measure whatsoever.

DRO(NE) is rated a little better by Quackle but (Z)OR(I) is best for win% (still less than 1%). The leave is DDINW, hmm, what bingos are lurking in there? Is it going to fit under WILL somehow?  INDOWED, WADDING, WINDLED, WIDENED, SWIDDEN.

#note Glad I finally got a bingo rack I can recognize, even though I can't play it anywhere.
>Tony_Cook: IM 2N MI +25 390
>Leeds: EILNORS 7F LO. +12 195
#note Quackle does not like LO here - better is to use 1 tile with (TRIGO)N, O(R)T, or (CARE)R and wait for rain to come.  Or IN(V)ER(T) to open bingo lines.

>Tony_Cook: OP 14A OP +18 408
>Leeds: EEINQRS 8L Q. +21 216
#note QIS E5 is less heroic but more playable.

>Tony_Cook: ADEERST E2 DEAREST +72 480
>Leeds: EEIINRS C9 REI.E +18 234
#note Whatever.  (REIN(V)ES(T) for 29 is the best play.)

>Tony_Cook: FN 3D F.N +6 486
#note Mercifully staying under 500 for me! Thanks Tony! So then when the game is over instead of getting to talk about how bad my racks were etc. I get to hear about how I cock-blocked MaSTUR(BATING), and then joke expanded to fill the entire universe.
