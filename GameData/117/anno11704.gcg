#note I missed (J)EBEL. This simes about 2 back. Not really wanting to open the board here, though.

>dacrON: EEILORR 10L REEL +19 272
#note RE(B)OIL seemed to be asking for trouble. It can be really hard to accept that the seemingly suicidal play is in fact the right play. REEL is just not the right play. I know it's not the right play even as I make it, yet somehow I still do it. Or am I just overanalyzing this?
>Mike_Frentz: EHITZ B1 ZI.ETH +56 294
#note well I wasn't expecting that...
>dacrON: INOORUY C9 .OURNO +26 298
#note (J)OURNO sims better, but if I could go back, I'd play (J)UNIOR, as the O is more versatile here (I missed the play).
>Mike_Frentz: ADFINQS 11J QAID +39 333
>dacrON: DEIKUYY A4 YEUKY +73 371
#note The first part of this play was convincing myself YEUKY was in fact TWL and not #. Then it became a question of how often Mike would bingo next turn, as YEUKY emptied the bag. The question was, do I win more if I empty the bag now, or if I leave tiles in the bag. I eventually concluded that QAID in no way implies the blank, and if I am willing to assume he DIDN'T have the blank after it, then there's a 55% chance he left it in the bag. Without the blank, he most certainly won't bingo 100 percent of the time, so it seemed like taking my chances emptying the bag was the best strategy. Quackle on manyply puts this play 2nd best at around a 30% win figure, and 11A YE(U)KY at 32.5%. Some other candidate plays for not emptying the bag are: A4 YEUK, L1 YUK, 12A KY(R)IE, J11 (Q)UEY.
