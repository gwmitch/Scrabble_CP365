#note Close call between this and the 8F placement, but I preferred this to avoid giving the X and Z spots.

>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: BZ F4 B.Z +34 49
>Dave_Koenig: DEFGGTY N2 GYTE +29 125
#note I like this beter than most of the plays that static evaluator ranks higher because of defense, but YEGG 7I is a good alternative.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: HO 9G OH +21 70
>Dave_Koenig: ADFGIMY L2 MAG.IFY +38 163
#note Pretty good, but I missed the star play MIFTY 4K.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: ?DEHILN K9 INHaLED +74 144
>Dave_Koenig: DDINSUW 14J W.NDS +34 197
#note WEIDS# is a significantly better way to do this and is definitely the best play here.  DISBUD 4C is fancy but leaves too much open on the bottom.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: AEEGR 15F GEARE. +29 173
>Dave_Koenig: DIOQRUW 4H QI +47 244
#note I missed the tricky-to-see QUOAD# through the blank.  It is much stronger both for breaking up the UW and blocking the board.  Mine is the second best play.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: ILT 10E LIT +15 188
>Dave_Koenig: NORSUVW 14C VROUW +23 267
#note Their play took away the very nice VROW 10F, but I believe this is the best way to play here.  Playing point greedy with WON or VOR at M1 is not good because of the leaves.  It makes more sense with this lead to sacrifice a few points and race to the end of the game.  Also WAVY 3K is not so good with a vowel heavy bag.  This play also has the advantage of partially blocking column D bingos.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: AINRSTT 11C TRANSIT +81 269
>Dave_Koenig: DNOORSU 8L .OND +24 291
#note I like this play for several reasons:  I'm taking away the triple from them as well as the N column for bingos.  I'm holding OUR M1 for the next turn.  The leave gives me some chances to bingo on column C.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: ACEV M10 CAVE. +22 291
>Dave_Koenig: EIORRSU O1 ROUE +26 317
#note Better I think than OUR M1 or UREA M2.  Playing an extra vowel makes sense.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: EEMT 12B MEET +21 312
#note TEEM would have given me the STEEM# hook.
>Dave_Koenig: AIIKNRS 3I KIN. +28 345
#note I hesitated whether to play the N just because of the possibility of vowel trouble, but I decided I couldn't leave the extra two points on the table.  But ZIN might be better to beat them to a good scoring spot for both of us and to keep the K to score later.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: ELPT 13F PELT +21 333
>Dave_Koenig: AAIIORS 6D RI.AS +30 375
#note I was a bit worried about the timing of this and the three vowel leave, but I decided I had to do it, and Championship player agrees with me.  It has the play winning 90% of the time and nothing else winning more than 61%.  They are likely to go out first in the endgame, but I should score enough to keep the lead.
>Bob_Linn_&_Dan_Milton: ALNOOSX 15N OX +29 362
#note LORANS first was more accurate, but it's still not enough.
>Dave_Koenig: ADEIO D4 AI.ED +16 391
#note It was the last play of the night and I didn't want to screw things up.  I saw this would give them an out, and I was sure it wasn't the best way to play for spread.  But I didn't want to get too fancy by playing short to try to block everything and miss some out play.  Take the sure win.
