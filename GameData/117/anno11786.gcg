>Gunther_Jacobi: ALPPQVY D8 .LAPPY +30 30
>Gunther_Jacobi: ALPPQVY --  -30 0
#note I was going to play (A)PPLY F8, but convinced myself that CLAPPY was good. I missed (Z)APPY...
>Dave_Johnson: AEIU E7 U.AEI +10 48
>Gunther_Jacobi: ALPPQVY D10 PLAY +24 24
#note HELLO!!?? APPLY D11! Gut-wrenching to play through this!
>Dave_Johnson: AENO F10 AEON +16 64
#note He's getting himself out of bad racks, and I'm still holding QV down two tempi.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EIPQSTV -QV +0 24
#note Quackle likes 14B QIS. This exchange is third best after SPIV I8.
>Dave_Johnson: AEGU G5 GAU.E +17 81
>Gunther_Jacobi: EIIPSST 13C P.I. +18 42
#note Missing the monster that would have more than equalized. 5E PI(G)STIES for 94.
>Dave_Johnson: NN 6F N.N +5 86
#note I haven't played well enough to capitalize off Dave's misfortune.
>Gunther_Jacobi: EFHISST I8 SHIFT +32 74
#note FEISTS 14A for 45 evens the game.
>Dave_Johnson: CLO 11I .LOC +18 104
#note Dave had been thinking longer than usual this game, especially on this play. I'm definitely putting him on the blank.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAELQST 10H Q. +11 85
>Dave_Johnson: OSW J10 S.OW +25 129
#note Another long think.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AAEILST 14A ILEA +22 107
#note Dave said he spaced this PLAY hook. I didn't like parting with my E, but something wild had to be done. Quackle likes AA 14C.
>Dave_Johnson: ?AENNRT M5 TANNERs +67 196
#note Missing A8 TRiENN(I)A for 122, 5E NE(G)ATRoN, eNTRAN(C)E L5. TANNERs comes fifth. It's worth noting his weakest play blocks my only comeback bingo. I'd almost prefer him hitting his 3x3. Ugh.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEIKOST 6L O.K +17 124
#note This sucks. KATIO(N) H1.
>Dave_Johnson: HMW A12 WH.M +48 244
#note Lost much hope after this play.
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEEIIST 5G .IE +6 130
#note All plays are pretty pathetic here. Least pathetic is I(N)IA 8L.
>Dave_Johnson: DFIS 8K FI.DS +30 274
>Gunther_Jacobi: AEINRST 15D STEARIN +86 216
#note I needed something from the M at 15A.
>Dave_Johnson: JO 4H JO +37 311
>Gunther_Jacobi: BIMOTTY J1 TOBY +24 240
#note I saw JOTTY and WOMBY for 30, but no leave looked promising. The best leave/score I could find that also opened up the board was TOBY...I also didn't like WOMBY because it blocked column O.
>Dave_Johnson: ?ERVX 1G VER.eX +69 380
#note Sewing it up...
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEGIMTU 3J .UG +6 246
#note Quackle likes (O)DIUM 2J. I felt I needed to keep my ED for DJIN to have any shot at bingoing. Yet all Quackle's top recommendations spend the D. Tough spot here.
>Dave_Johnson: GLOO L11 .OLOG +20 400
>Gunther_Jacobi: DDEIMTU 14K M.D +6 252
#note (W)I(L)D 13J.
>Dave_Johnson: DEEIRT 3C RETIED +26 426
>Gunther_Jacobi: DEIRTUV N12 VIED +30 282
#note At 4A is 2pts more.
>Dave_Johnson: AB 2E AB +22 448
#note BRUTAL.
