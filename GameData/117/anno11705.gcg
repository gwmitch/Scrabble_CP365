#note MIS(M)AKE for 69. Nice. I'm almost positive I remember just playing really fast to time pressure my opponent so I probably just didn't look hard enough here...luckily this is when I can make a erally bad play for 41 so it's not all that bad

#note A(X)E sims best but I really did not want to leave 2 bingo lanes open AND a bad leave, so I figured playing off the J and blocking the best lane with a solid unseen pool was the best decision, however quackle still thinks AXE is best

>Joey_Krafchick: AEIIRSW B7 W. +5 357
#note Here is where I disagree with quackle - EARWIG sims best by far however there are so many more possibilities at bingoes for him if the O is still open (DELETION, etc) as opposed to where if I play W(O) the only bingo possibility I see is LENITED at 3I, which has a very small chance of actually being on his rack
