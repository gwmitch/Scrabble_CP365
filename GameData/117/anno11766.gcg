#note Didn't know Rhaphe or Ephah. (That takes an H?)
>Meredith_Leigh: DNOUW 9H WOUND +21 21
>Avery_Mojica: AEILPRS 10F PIA +17 35
#note Darn it! Missed Pralines, Lipreads, Spiraled, and Parslied. I should know all the D ones, but not the N one. This scores quite high though.

#note I took a long time with this play. This is the best. Yay.
>Meredith_Leigh: AZ J5 AZ. +32 101
>Avery_Mojica: AEIRRST L1 TARRIES +73 154
#note Best again. On a roll!
>Meredith_Leigh: ADGIN 1J DA.ING +24 125
>Avery_Mojica: AEEEEPT 10J PE +22 176
#note Didn't like opening up the board.
>Meredith_Leigh: RSU G5 RUS. +8 133
#note Was surprised by this play. Opens the U, has hooks, and dumps an S. Seems totally legit for a Division 1 player... O_O
>Avery_Mojica: AEEEEOT 11J OE +15 191
#note I should start exchanging. But I liked this cute little fit.
>Meredith_Leigh: EEE -EEE +0 133
>Avery_Mojica: AABEEET H1 ABATE +26 217
#note Even quackle agrees to play this.
>Meredith_Leigh: KN 5J .K.N +16 149
>Avery_Mojica: DEEGMOO 2K M.DE +25 242
#note Don't like opening up words like ORE (had I played DOME F4) right next to a double.
>Meredith_Leigh: EFR I11 REF +13 162
>Avery_Mojica: CEGOOTY H13 EGO +17 259
#note Seeming like she had a lot of consonants, YO didn't make sense to me. I blocked it anyway, seems fine.
>Meredith_Leigh: ?INRSTY 14A tRYSTIN. +76 238
#note I don't know if she would have found STINGRAY 3B. Nice find though anyway.
>Avery_Mojica: CELORTY A12 CO.E +24 283
#note Clotty. (facepalm)
>Meredith_Leigh: AE 13C AE +17 255
>Meredith_Leigh: AE --  -17 238
#note Nope. I know my 3s pretty well. As George said later (unrelated to this game) to a fellow Division 2 player, "You can't play phoney 3s against a Division 1 player or a high division 2 player."
>Avery_Mojica: DELMRTY F3 YLEM +28 311
#note It's a fun word! And there's no X left, so it's ok.
>Meredith_Leigh: AE G2 AE +14 252
>Avery_Mojica: DIIQRVV -QVV +0 311
#note Well. Quackle says exchange EVERYTHING. I didn't want to risk drawing like I did with Matthew, So I exchanged the bad stuff. Then comes the strategy part. Amazingly, exchanging only QVV scores low on the list. Didn't like two Is?
>Meredith_Leigh: O C13 O. +10 262
#note We are both playing small plays in hopes of not drawing too much garbage. Well, at least I was.
>Avery_Mojica: ACDIJRT 12K D.. +9 320
#note Caird? Cere? Didn't know. I wanted to play TAJ J13 but didn't want to draw the Q and Vs again. This keeps it open.
>Meredith_Leigh: E 6E E.. +5 267
>Avery_Mojica: ACFIJRT E5 F.R +26 346
#note Still drawing little, but couldn't pass this up.
>Meredith_Leigh: EIQTU 8A QUITE +52 319
#note She had that... Well now I know she has bad tiles.
>Avery_Mojica: ACIJLTV J13 TAJ +18 364
#note Taj time.
>Meredith_Leigh: ?BLLV C7 V.LLa +12 331
>Avery_Mojica: CILV N1 ..VI +7 371
#note Not bad. Decent win.
