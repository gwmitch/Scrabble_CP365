>Jason: ?AHIPUV 8G VAU +12 12
>Carol_Ravichandran: ACILLRY I7 C.RLY +14 14
#note Carol was quite disappointed I left her seven an orphan. Duck finds her eight through the A. Oddly, Superleaves apparently gives ACILRY a +18 and suggets fishing off the L.
>Jason: ?DHIIPS 11I .IP +16 28
#note Meanwhile, she blocked my DIPSHIt, which would've been really nice to play with Knappster sitting next to me. YID may be better since it doesn't give up the -E hook and the leaves are comparable.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADILMOP 12J DOM +19 33
#note Now I don't give Carol a home for her seven again. Go me. I don't notice her phony two. That's bad. Damn Collins; I didn't think anything out of the ordinary about knowing the hooks for PO#.
>Jason: ?DHIISW 13K HID +26 54
#note Saw WILDISH, wasn't sure enough and figured she'd challenge.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ILO G8 .IOL +8 41
>Jason: ?EGISTW 12A WIdGETS +86 140
>Carol_Ravichandran: EIP A12 .IPE +27 68
>Jason: EFNNNOW B11 F.NE +24 164
#note Saving the W for F10 plays.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AU F12 .AU +5 73
>Jason: NNOOSWY 10F W.O.Y +42 206
#note SWOONY is probably better to take out the hot spot.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AJT 15F TAJ +34 107
>Jason: GNNNOSS E11 G.N +10 216
#note Given how short Carol had been playing, I wanted to keep the board as closed as possible. She hits column N, hopefully I get the triple coming back.
>Carol_Ravichandran: III -III +0 107
>Jason: BNNOSST -BN +0 216
#note Given the plethora of vowels left, I prefer this to TUB. Not wanting to telegraph the S leave yet, didn't like SUB or STUB.
>Carol_Ravichandran: NR 15A .RN +11 118
>Jason: AKNOSST 14A ..AK +12 228
#note Or S(U)K.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADEX N11 AXED +32 150
>Jason: GMNOSST 10L TOMS +33 261
#note Statically, TOMS is best by about two points, but in hindsight SMOG at O8 is safer and more prudent.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ADENORR O3 READORN. +80 230
>Jason: ABEGINS 9L AB +16 277
#note Of note: My rack after SMOG is ABEINST, far more flexible than ABEGINS.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AHI 8L HAI. +26 256
>Jason: EGILNST 14L GE. +14 291
#note Still not sure what's right. Duck's suggested fishes won't work. Maybe SEG for 24? And would you believe this was my only E after turn five/my last E?
>Carol_Ravichandran: ENOZ 3K ZONE. +28 284
>Jason: IILNSTU K3 .IT +24 315
#note Chose ZIN over ZIT because there was one unseen I (and I had an I) vs. five unseen E's (and I didn't have an E).
>Carol_Ravichandran: IQ 6J QI +44 328
#note Wrong again.
>Jason: ILNRRSU 4I RU.N +12 327
#note Right tiles, wrong place. (I)NUR(E). Carol thought I had the B; my thought process was that if she took the spot, she'd give me openings to bingo. And this leave ain't bad considering almost 1/3 of the pool is E's (plus a couple T's). Plus, what are my other options?
>Carol_Ravichandran: CELU 5F CLUE +8 336
>Jason: AILRSTT 7I .IST +38 365
#note I figure at this point even if she has the blank, the board's so fugly and the rest of the pool so bad for bingos, I can run. Pulled the blank to be able to breathe easy.
>Carol_Ravichandran: BEEEOSV 6N E. +5 341
#note Slick play, and the kind of play that shows why spread shouldn't be a factor. Yeah, 5/8 times I bingo out (include 1/2 her hits for OBSERVE/OBSERVE(d)), but fishing off the E and drawing the blank is her only chance to win.
>Jason: ?AFLORT 2L FOR +24 389
#note So, four possible draws for me at the end; two of which allow me to bingo out, one of which allows her to bingo out and win. I took the middle road.
>Carol_Ravichandran: BEEEOSV 3G VEE +15 356
>Jason: ?ALT 1M TAx +12 401
#note Missed LiTA(I) and unsure of LATe(d). Not a well-played game at all.
>Carol_Ravichandran: BEOS 15J BOS +14 370
>Jason: L 9K L.. +5 406
>Jason:  (E) +2 408
