#note Wow, what a break. I can smell what is coming a mile away.
>Glenn_Filzer: ?DGINST 14H TiDINGS +102 172
#note Even worse than I thought. It ended up being a 5-point game, so you can see just how huge this break was for Glenn.
>Winter: CDEIISU 15D SUICIDE +94 255
#note My own lucky break, which also happens to be one of my favorite words, and something I wished I could do after this tournament.
>Glenn_Filzer: FO O8 OF +35 207
>Winter: EEEHIQS 11D QI +26 281
#note I was really hoping the value of ditching the vowel was worth fewer points and giving up the Q counterplay, but this play ended up costing me huge as well, thanks to grubby scrubby luck.
>Glenn_Filzer: AAAA -AAAA +0 207
>Winter: EEEHOSU O12 HE +20 301
#note The scourge of bad racks begins.
>Glenn_Filzer: CEIIR 12B ICIER +39 246
#note Ouch, primarily because of the D hook. The board is almost dead, and I'm up 55 points, but with my racks fizzling, that D could allow Glenn back in.
>Winter: EEEORSU 5E EURO +10 311
#note He's going to catch up if I don't straw drawing better. Quack likes ROUE and EURO at 14A, but this play blocks the easiest bingo line.
>Glenn_Filzer: OOUZ 5J OUZO +31 277
#note Rut-roh.
>Winter: AEEEIMS C12 .EE +10 321
#note Still can't score (unless I give up the S)!!!
>Glenn_Filzer: AEJN 6B JEAN +29 306
#note GODDAMN IT!!! I SMELL THE GAME SLIPPING AWAY!!!
>Winter: AEGIMOS 13I MOA +22 343
#note This is where I lost it.  Weird-ass uncommon word.
>Glenn_Filzer: AG J10 AG +17 323
>Winter: EGINSTW L3 WI. +30 373
#note I saw SWE(E)TING and almost played it, but then I thought of SWEETED* and was pretty sure I hadn't seen it, so I decided I should be able to win without it.
>Glenn_Filzer: ABNR B10 BA.RN +32 355
#note Creeping up on me!!!
>Winter: EGLNPST 4H PEG +24 397
#note Now I'm really worried. Only three vowels unseen, and with the blank in the bag, that E is a threat for a bingo. But with just an 18-point lead, if I block the E, Glenn will catch up. But if I play the E and don't draw a vowel, I could also lose.
>Glenn_Filzer: OT 3K T.O +12 367
>Winter: LNNRSTT C5 N. +2 399
#note I'm low on time and can't look for his bingo, but I have to assume he has one. I'm running out of time and can't find a block that doesn't give him back a big counterplay AND leaves me a play thru the U at F6, which I need. I don't have time to consider his possible D(ICIER) play. If I see DOoR, then I just play L(E)NT which allows me to go out first.
