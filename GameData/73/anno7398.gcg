#note Not such a bright idea against someone you're 1-5 against (and 1-6 looks pretty likely already).  I yawn more often than I yell or yelp, yet only the latter two take the OUT prefix.
>Joey: ANOSTUY --  -78 0
>Will: AEGIRSV E5 VAG.RIES +98 126
#note For the record, I once recovered from 199-0 start, so I'm not out of this just yet.

#note I could have gone out with CONDUCE to save a little spread.  That would have given me a nice even 300, and kept Will under 500.  Still not very close, though.
