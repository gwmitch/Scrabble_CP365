#note ORBIEST: DONKEY IN A CIRCLE*.  SOBRIETY isn't too hard of a find, but the fact that it required two invisible letters made it more missable.

#note Rather bold, but using the X now left me with a punchless leave.  This gave me a decent shot at a huge score next turn.
>Marlon: BKN A1 B.NK +45 305
>Joey: AENORTX A1 ....NOTE +42 273
#note Setting up another potential big X play, as I anticipate getting right back into this game.
>Marlon: AEIMV 1H MAVIE +48 353
#note Dayum!
>Joey: AGINRWX B5 AXING +60 333

>Marlon: ADHINS 3I DANISH +31 384
>Joey: DEIOPRW J3 .W +5 338
#note I win if I draw the S.  He wouldn't have already had it, or he would have played SANDHIS.
>Marlon: CHLRSTT L1 .T.C +12 396
>Joey: DEINOPR 2N OP +18 356
#note After about 5 minutes, Marlon demanded me to just play sumpin', and I reminded him that he usually points out the best endgame sequence when the outcome is not in question.  He told me "yo funny".
>Marlon: HLRST 4E .HS +19 415
>Joey: DEINR D10 IR.NED +9 365
#note Marlon was due.  This was his first win against me since August 4, 2004.  It was fun anyway, as always!
