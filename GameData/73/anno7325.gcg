#note Neither Jeremy or I were sure which one takes the S. Under different circumstances, I might decide I have to challenge, but once I saw the bingo I decided I couldn't risk losing the spot.

#note This was a killer position. The tile pool shows a good chance of a bingo to the S, so I really need to drop the G to block. I could play SING or SUNG and keep a tile for the Q, but giving up the 9 points could also cost me the game. I really need the points, and to either not draw the Q or draw the A or I to go with it.

#note My only show now is to draw the I, but I need two spots, which means playing the T at N2 to set up another Q play. I finally decide that plan will lose and try to survive the Q stick. If I get the J I can do it.
