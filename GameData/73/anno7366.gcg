#note Speedy says SCOP at 8L is best (considered it) and COB at E4 is slightly preferred as PRST > CRST. Speedy doesn't know what happens to people who give Chuck C's to bingo through.

#note To quote Dan Stock about a blunder he'd made earlier in the day to blow a won game: "If brain farts smelled, that one would've cleared the room!" Chuck asked if it was Collins (I checked, it's not). C'mon, Jason, I know you're tired and all, but this is a huge game rating-wise. Wake up. At least now I'll never forget: JUGA is the plural of JUGUM; only takes the -L even in Collins.

#note I daresay I deserved that draw.

>Jason: IOPRSTY D8 YO. +16 162
#note I daresay I deserved to have SPORTILY get blocked. Missed PITY at K9. "If we aren't careful, somebody's going to break 200!" Chuck said. "I know! Is there a prize for low win?" I asked.
>Chuck_Armstrong: EI O8 .IE +13 188
>Jason: ?IPRSST 12D eSPRITS +76 238
#note Trying to make row 13 bingos as hard as possible while hitting the double.
>Chuck_Armstrong: ADEEMNS 11H MEED +35 223
#note Chuck thought it might only be SEEDSMAN. One of the advantages to being the top seed to Chuck's second seed; you play him later in the day when he's a little fatigued. When he's firing on all cylinders, though, he's still one of the most difficult players on the planet to play against.

>Chuck_Armstrong: ENZ H11 ..ZEN +48 271
>Jason: DEEIMOR 15D DOMI.EER +63 317
#note As I looked at this rack, I thought: "What're the odds Chuck will play to the Y or from the MI and give me an N to play through?" Voila. Sometimes, it's just your day.

#note Liked that this left seven in the bag in case Chuck bingoed.
>Chuck_Armstrong: AAGIINS A4 IGNA.IAS +60 355
#note More luck for me: DOTY the turn prior leads to GAINSAI(D) and a win for him.
>Jason: ?EILOTV L12 VOEs +23 368
#note Four behind EVIL or LEVO at M10, but it does the job. Another win I didn't deserve, but will take.
