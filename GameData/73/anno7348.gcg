#note I guess FAUVE 6G is better for the extra point.

>Joey: AEHIOPS 9G .HO +22 106
#note I wish I had thought of INPHASE 12F.  Then I would have hoped for him to put an S on the end.

#note Yep, I got away with this.  I knew something was in here (ARE-LIPS: LOVED WOMEN PUCKER THEM), and I saw ESPALIER, but thought it was #, confusing it with ESCALIER#.  Feel free to make fun of this play all you want.  I dare ya.

>Joey: ?INNNOP H1 NINONs +23 370
#note PINON, PINONS, and PINONES, but no PINONE*.  I always get those mixed up.
