>Jim_Burlant: AEFIRTX D4 FIXE. +30 30
#note 9F FAX!  No need to turn 4 tiles with this rack.
>Mike_Early: AOV C2 AVO +17 81
>Jim_Burlant: ABELRTU G5 TUR.ABLE +62 92
#note The draw bails me out from the previous mistake.  J6 RUSTABLE and J4 BALUSTER both score 64, and they don't give back potentially huge plays on the triple, either.
>Mike_Early: ADGINRT E7 D.RATING +73 154
>Jim_Burlant: EGNORSU 11G .OUNGERS +68 160
#note Best bingo, nothing else sims within 3 points.
>Mike_Early: CDIR 2B D.RIC +28 182
#note I held this, as I had to remember that DORIC* is the phony.
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMOWZ M9 ZI.AM +52 212
#note Any of a number of strong plays in this position, and this is one of them.  3A WOVE, C6 AW, 12L MEOW, and 5A ZOWIE are also worth consideration.
>Mike_Early: PW 12D W.P. +18 200
>Jim_Burlant: AEFJOWY C6 OW +29 241
#note Quackle prefers AW in this location by a hair.  I figured that as long as he didn't have the B he couldn't really hurt me.  This choice sims as runner up and it starts an interesting sequence.
>Mike_Early: ABP B6 BAP +39 239
#note Well, why not?
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHJOY A7 JOY +67 308
#note I initially put down HOY and realized I had JOY at the last second; didn't take the time to find JOEY, which scores 3 more.  Remember that number:  3 points.
>Mike_Early: HLOU 14B LOU.H +34 273
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHIOR 15F OAF +23 331
#note FAIL.  I saw and rejected Quackle's first choice of N8 OAFS and was too preoccupied with the bingo line his play of LOUGH had opened up.  My choice  is so-so; it gives up way too many points relative to other options and doesn't balance the rack enough to make up for it.  Out of all the choices, I think 15A FOH is right;  Too bad I didn't look hard enough to find it.  The sim also likes 15G AFIRE/AFORE, but with only 1 R in the unseen pool I'm loath to play it off for anything under a bingo or a game-deciding play.
>Mike_Early: ?GINNOS J1 SpONGIN. +60 333
#note Mike's best bingo here is cONSIGNS at J1, and he's still winning only 31%.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEEHINR 1J .HINER +30 361
#note While it scores decently,this play does a very poor job playing the tile pool.  3B EVEN  and H1 HEREIN are much better.  HEREIN also scores 34 to this play's 30.  
>Mike_Early: AQ 6F Q.A +32 365
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEEIM H2 AECI. +12 373
#note I remembered the S and P front hooks to LOUGH.  Saw the possibility of CLOUGH but wasn't sure whether it was good or if I were imagining it was good.  MICE, MACE, AMICE, etc. down the A column front-hooking LOUGH are the star plays here.  Nothing like vomiting away 30% winning chances due to lack of confidence in your word knowledge.
>Mike_Early: DEILRTY 4H .I.DERY +26 391
#note post-mortem, Mike told me this was his rack.  Quackle doesn't like Mike's play at all, but it certainly prevented me from diong what I wanted on the next turn.
>Jim_Burlant: EEM 3M EME +21 394
#note Did not write this rack down.
>Mike_Early: AELLTTU 13A LAT +12 403
>Jim_Burlant: DEKOTTV L10 K.TO +30 424
#note And despite all my mistakes to this point, I can still win this game...but once again I blow it.  EKED scores 34 and will prevent his ELUTE out from winning the game...but of course I missed it, only seeing KETO.
