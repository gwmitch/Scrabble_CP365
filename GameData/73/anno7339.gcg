#note Online game.  You'll see why I posted this one once it gets to the end.  :P
>pieguy1372: ?ADIIRU 9C DUI +12 12
#note Didn't know UREDInIA and didn't see RADUIM.  This is third.

#note Missed a bunch of plays like JAGra M9 and Z(O)EAE H11.  This play is sixth.
>oilcan: AMNOTTU 13C OUTMAN +27 163
#note OUT(TRICKING) K3 would have been awesome
>pieguy1372: AAEGVXZ 11A ZAX +35 219
#note Not sure how I missed ZAX 14A, but it's too risky anyway (although I have one of the A's to score there).  Q says VEX 14A and Z(ON)AE H11 are better.  That seems about right.
>oilcan: IQRRSTW D12 Q.IT +28 191
>pieguy1372: AAEEGIV 15D .AIGA +18 237
#note Missed AVE(r)AGE, which seems about right despite opening up the T/T.  (This is eighth, giving up 8.2 valuation.)
>oilcan: LRRSSWY 5C WRY +28 219
>pieguy1372: EENNOSV A11 .ONES +45 282
#note Ouch, there was a bingo here I didn't know: VENENOS(E) O1 93.  This is second.
>oilcan: HILRSSU B14 HI +22 241
>pieguy1372: BEENRSV 4D ER +14 296
#note This isn't even on Q's list, but I wanted to block any possible bingoes at E4.  I figure I can sacrifice points to close the board since I'm ahead and there are only a few spots left.  M10 VE(r)B, which I also saw, is best according to Q.
>oilcan: LLRSSUV 10H LUR. +10 251
>pieguy1372: BEHNSVY 3B YEH +24 320
#note Again it's not even on Q's list, but I wanted to close the board and the A hook at B5 was a pretty dangerous threat.

>oilcan: DLLNOSU 1C OLD +10 283
>pieguy1372: CENNPSV O8 .VEN +7 359
#note Q prefers NEV(E) G3 but I had to close this line (this is second).
>oilcan: ?ADLNSU A1 D. +9 292
#note Yes, that was a THIRD BLANK.  But this is only the start of the craziness...
>pieguy1372: CNPPRST 10M .P. +11 370
>oilcan: ?ALNSTU O8 ....TUAL +36 328
#note So there's one in the bag.  He plays this, and so he should have four tiles, right?  Watch and see...
>pieguy1372: ACNPRST B5 ACT +21 391
#note Didn't know BYPAST, and apparently ACTS here is second.  But get a load of what happened...
>oilcan: ?DINSTW G3 WID. +12 340
#note Yes, he got seven tiles again.  I have no idea what on earth caused this.  Anyway, wait and see the ending...
>pieguy1372: NPRS 13C ......S +13 404
#note How long will this go on?  ISC had "INOSTU?" in the tile pool from my perspective at this point...
>oilcan: ?INOSTU A7 UN +8 348
#note Aaaand it goes on.  Also, OpUNTI(A)S L1.
>pieguy1372: NPR 14N P. +8 412
#note Tile pool: IMOOST?.  This is insane.  XD
>oilcan: ?IMOOST 11E OM +15 363
>pieguy1372: NR N6 R.. +8 420
#note Tile pool: "EILOST?".  Uh oh, he's got a bingo now and I can't block it!  This is getting more and more hilarious...
>oilcan: ?EILOST 3G .oOLIEST +72 435
#note Apparently there were two more in the bag after this.
>oilcan: N (N) +2 437
#note Well, this was hilarious.  I don't even know what on earth happened, but I had a lot of fun.  :D Note: I played (E)N L3 and got 4 points from his AR.  Final score: 435 - 428.
