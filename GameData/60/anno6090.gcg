>Bob: AEILRST 9E SLATIER +68 68
#note Bob laid down URALITES here, thought for a while, and then took it back and decided to play more defensively.  I couldn't disagree with his decision more strongly.
>Dave: ADELNTV J8 L.VANTED +72 82
#note I think my choice here illustrates our different attitudes about offense and defense.

#note Alyssa, I hope you didn't just get hives from looking at this.

>Dave: AAEGGPU 7E AGAPE +25 187
#note Hmm... I saw the other spot for this word, but this looked like a safer way of playing it.  Still, I didn't bother to count that I was actually giving up 8 points.  However, his last moves suggests a strong bingo leave, and probably not many high point tiles to take advantage of plays parallel to HERBIEST, so this works out pretty well.  There were still too many A's to try GAPE B12.
>Bob: ?AEINOS N5 ANOmIES +78 236
#note If I had been in Bob's shoes here, I would have taken a little extra time to try to find the best way to bingo, because it really can make a big difference in this game situation.  AcINOSE is the play.
>Dave: FGGTUWX O7 XU +39 226
#note I did not realize that TUX scores a point more, while shedding another consonant.  However, this play is pretty good because it holds several front hooks for OX and WEFT as possibilities for the next turn.
>Bob: EFORT O1 FORTE +29 265
>Dave: EFGGOTW M5 WOG +30 256
>Bob: ACIV 3K VICA. +20 285
#note Wow, his play was a godsend for my rack.
>Dave: DEFGPRT L1 GR.FT +29 285
>Bob: IKLO 10B KILO +20 305
>Dave: DDEINPY 1F EDDYIN. +39 324
#note And here is where I missed the opportunity that might have won me the game and some cash.  Dammit!
>Bob: ENNO 12B NONE +19 324
>Dave: CMOOPRU 2D POMO +27 351
#note Who knows what the hell to do here?  There's lots of good stuff remaining for both sides, and the game will probably come down to who can go out first.  I could not find a five tile play from 2B.  There's MUCOR, (I only thought of MUCRO.) but it's got to be better to hang onto the U with the Q unseen.
>Bob: EHJU 1A JEHU +50 374
#note And this wins it, since I can't stop him from going out next turn.
>Dave: ACIQRSU 3A QUASI +35 386
#note It looked to me like it would end QUICK, ATONE 3B or this play followed by ATONE 6B, which were identical on spread.  We both missed his better out of TRONA 14D, which means I should just take the points.
>Bob: ?ANOT 6A bATON +8 382
#note We both had played very quickly and had been double checking many of the scores as we headed into the endgame.  Here Bob recounted the entire game before settling on his move.  I recounted again afterward, and we still got to the same result every time.
>Bob:  (CR) +8 390
