>Joey: ?ADDRSU 8G DUD +10 10
>Jason: ?AAIRRT 7I AR +7 7
#note Found some eights that didn't play, but not the (high-prob) one that did. Not bad for a bingo miss, though; a <15 pt. mistake.
>Joey: ?AEIORS 6D ISObARE +68 78

>Jason: CHINOTT M10 .ITCH +26 183
#note Having the E for BEWITCH would've been cute.
>Joey: AELMRST E4 M..ALTERS +72 272
#note ARMLETS 9C scores 2 more points, but this shut down the board better.
>Jason: ENNOORT D10 NOON +16 199
#note Nice play by Joey on the previous turn, not just taking the easy play and going for board control/style points. Also, quiz from McKenzie in an LJ comment: Find any of the three in MISALTERS+P. All are kinda cool.
>Joey: ABEHIPT 2J BE.IT +46 318
>Jason: AEEIORT 1G AERO +17 216
#note Have ETAERIO#, Joey gives me the spot ... but we're not playing Collins. Alas.
>Joey: AHNPRVY 2B HRYVNA +36 354
>Jason: EFIIOTU 3A FIE +21 237
#note Hard to complain about getting killed to someone nine-ing and HRYVNA-ing you. Joey, as always seemingly, played well.
>Joey: ACLNOPS A3 .ALCON +36 390
>Jason: IINOPTU 1M PIU +22 259
>Joey: AEGKPSU C12 KEG +27 417
>Jason: DEINOTZ N6 ZO.E. +37 296
#note Somehow I'd mistracked and had three E's out instead of two, so playing off the E for five more seemed OK. ZO(NE)D is probably a little better for spread's sake.
>Joey: AEGIPSU 1A UP +20 437
>Jason: DINNOTT 14I NINT. +10 306
#note Any vowel (or the S) and I go out ... thought the 4/7 shot might come through. Nope.
