#note ok, quackle is saying 7F IT is the play, which is certainly very nice and i should have considered it. i always try to go "halfway" in between making a fishing play and making a play that tries to end the game faster. i can't do that, i gotta choose one and do it all the way. GINT is simply not as strong as AGILNT with this board. the other thing is, even IT is a BAD strategic mistake. all i need to do is VATTING. why the hell fish? i didn't want to do VATTING because he might score up at 1L but I still think it's the best play in this situation, even though it's about 14 pts of valuation behind IT. -15

#note NAMING is EXACTLY the play i was looking for. DAMN IT!! at least i started trying to be clever, so maybe next time i'll find the clever play. big mistake. -16

#note i laid down 6C CEIL but suddenly i KNEW he had a 3-3, so i played this instead. quackle likes O3 NIECES best for some reason.  -3

#note i was basically praying to the pagan gods here that he would let me have ESTHESIS and then this came down. HESSITE is right outside what i've been studying recently, which tells you how bad my word knowledge is. certainly it is winninger than not bingoing if i somehow draw a bingo in two spots after it. at least for spread. -30.5

>Cesar: EIISTTU 4K .E +14 382
#note so, i was still sulking about esthesis being blocked with a bingo, and my chances of winning being 0, and i wasn't even 100% on gastraea taking an S, when suddenly I realized I was already almost a minute overtime. i thought why not, and fished for OUISTITI. turns out the I WAS in the bag! still, i gotta of course fish for ditties/kitties/tiniest. it's a bit annoying how gloomy i can get, my win streak is broken, i blew this game by not playing VATTING, i haven't beaten david in ages, and i let myself get overtime accidentally. i actually almost blew the next two games too. i gotta work on my mood. anyway, championship player picks  UT as the only thing that gives me a winning chance, so i dunno. my move actually does SIM best on many-ply! lol

#note the bag hadn't even been emptied at this point, but i did not notice until david told me when he emailed me his racks. david thought it was empty when he did DORmIN and turns out there was an I in the bag, the one I needed! argh! so that's more spread points I got that weren't rightfully mine! game ended 501-389 (i lost 20 on time)
