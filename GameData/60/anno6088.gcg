#note Talked myself out of WUD, which is CP's pick. Would regret it right about ...
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ?FHLRSU H4 FLUSHeR +82 82
#note now. I then noticed he couldn't bingo if I'd played WUD, so I'm already in an unpleasant mood.
>Jason: ?DGNRSU 11B GeRUNDS +79 79
#note When Chris and I finished the round prior, I noticed Bradley and Bowman each had about 15:00 left. So, having hit the skids, I went up to the room to try to unwind for a few minutes. The Mets and Cardinals were on Fox, scoreless in the fifth/sixth inning. Imagine my surprise when, after this game, after dinner, after Bruce's game show ... the game was still going!

>Jason: AELNORT M2 NA. +14 133
#note So frustrating that this didn't bingo and I didn't see any good fishes. Still not sure what to do.

>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AEEINSY 13I YEANS +46 230
#note As Trashman once said to me: "Nice play, but it costs you an S."
>Jason: BIOSTTY 3C YOB +26 227
#note Oh sure, now the U's are all tied up. Remember that eight from a story Lipe once told about Adam Logan finding it. Must've missed the L8 placement.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: EIIIMPT 12K PI.EI +24 254
#note PITME(N) would've been awesome! But this isn't bad at all.
>Jason: DIRSTTW L8 WIT +26 253
#note Feeling good. Case S, 16 V-18 C unseen pool is good for a DRST leave, bingo line at the bottom. I liked where I was here, even a bit behind.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: DEIMNTT 8A MIN.ED +33 287
#note Bradley said he debated between this and T(I)MID and would soon regret not playing the latter.
>Jason: DERRSTT O11 D.RT +5 258
#note :) ... Sherrie, taking color on this game since we were the last ones done, called this "dirty." (rimshot) TR(OW) is also intriguing.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: AAEOTTU 14E OUTEAT +19 306
>Jason: EGKRSTV 15L KEGS +60 318
#note I sighed way more than I should've before making a 60-point play, but since the S-hook is darn near unblockable, I would've liked to play using one of the other row 15 triples ... stupid GKV draw forcing my hand.
>Bradley_Whitmarsh: ADEJLOO 6C JOLE +26 332
#note Relieved Bradley did not play CP's pick of JO at 2B.
>Jason: AIORTVV 2B VAV +32 350
#note Sherrie couldn't believe this play. "Who plays VAV for 32 in a close endgame to win?" she asked incredulously. I raised my hand. Scott Kitchen was amused. Then she made a comment like "Well, Bradley, you get lucky a lot, so it's only fair you get unlucky once." Bradley: "What's that supposed to mean?" (A fair question ... she said something like "you win a lot," which I pointed out is probably because Bradley's one heck of a player.) I was going to joke "c'mon, Bradley, we all know you qualified because you're lucky", but then realized I was confusing Bradley with me. :)

#note Forgot about the I7 spot (I actually did see it before ADZ). Made dinner taste a little better; very relieved to be 5-6 instead of 4-7, but sorry it came against a friend and great player.
