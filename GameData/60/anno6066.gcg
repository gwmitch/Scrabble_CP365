#note I'm really struggling to understand what he could possibly have to make this play.  Obviously the other blank.  No S.  No E.  No Y.  That's all that can be inferred, I guess.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIIMTU L12 TI.E +14 147
#note Thought I was being clever.  No such luck.  ETUI L3 19.

#note Surprisingly weak; OUTLIE, it is.

#note I sorta intuited that this was a mistake but I couldn't think of anything better.  EPIC is good.

#note Hated this; Q doesn't.  BITE was the other not-so-appealing option.
>Scott_Kitchen: AHY E3 YAH +34 250
#note BITE doesn't look so bad now.

#note Low on time, I really botched this one.  Q Champ says FIAR, FAIR, or FOUR C5.  I don't know that emptying the bag is good.  FOU would be my choice, or even FA N10, in hindsight.  FA's got a pretty bad leave, especially with the dreck I'll end up drawing.
