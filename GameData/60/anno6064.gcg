#note This is the luckiest I'll get all weekend.
>Lou_Cornelis: EEINRST K1 ENTRIES +77 155
#note Plays like this kinda make me a bit... shall we say annoyed?
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEGOWY 1H DOG.Y +42 176
#note DOG(E)Y's the best I could do.  Q likes YOW(E)D a bit better.   Was a bit frustrated I could only get 42 off that.

#note -_-
>Ryan_Fischer: CEEEILW 2K .EWEL +21 197
>Lou_Cornelis: AEINSUZ 4G SUZE.AIN +86 282
#note ...of all the #*)(#%&  He put down (R)AIN first, so I was expecting a Y.  Ugh.
>Ryan_Fischer: BBCCEIR 12L BICE +29 226
#note And I draw BBCR to ICE.  -_-.  (S)CRIBE (a bit suicidal), but still.  I wonder if CRIBBE(D) would've made a difference?
>Lou_Cornelis: AQTU O8 QUAT. +42 324
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCEEOR 1N BE +22 248
#note Took forever here weighing the options, none of which are amazing.  OBE, I guess, is a slim glimmer of hope.  I saw CO(MA)E too, but that really messes up the board for the slim future prospects that remain.  Turnover shoulda been more of an issue, though.

#note I appreciate the little things, like plugging the Roto with DEFLNOT and staring it down in an endgame I'm about to lose.  :]
