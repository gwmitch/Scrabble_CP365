>Ryan_Fischer: EINOORZ 9F ZONE +25 25
#note Missed E(P)IZOON.  This is one game where you won't find me complaining about my misfortune.  I just wanted to get rid of one of those Os and set myself up, so I was quite happy playing ZONE.  So odd it doesn't rank higher.

>Weera_Saengsit: AIKOR G2 KORAI +21 279
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEILSU 10J ..A +5 232
#note 15H SLU(SHILY) is brilliant.  I decided to fish for UNEASIL(Y) as well as... (R)URALISE.  (And of course set up a place for a third bingo if possible.
>Weera_Saengsit: DEIV H1 VIDE +39 318
#note Le'dammit.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEILLSU M10 LAU. +11 243
#note SLUSHILY still.  My play IS second best, oddly.

#note Too little, too late.  Mental note: SILENUS + G = UGLINESS.

#note -_- ... what kind of word is that?
>Ryan_Fischer: AEFRSTY -  +0 313
#note Shoulda just let it go.  I had a 63-point SAFETY I didn't see, and a 53 point FRAY I did.
>Weera_Saengsit: CDEOO M3 COOED +31 437
#note That turned into UGLINESS fast!
