#note UNPAYING, crap. Would've turned a rack of dreck into 74 points. Only myself to blame for the events that follow.

#note I spent forever on this rack. How could there be no bingos? 13A INTI is better than this anyway.

#note I did see ESTIVaL at 13C, but I opted to avoid slotting a vowel in column H. Better yet is ESTIVaL at 13A.

#note M1 DUG seems far better. A12 BUDS is an interesting option as well, since the S is a little less valuable than usual on this board. BUNG really damages my chances.

#note Having spent so much time on the UNRIP turn, I was a little low on time, but not so low that I couldn't have determined that fishing a D and trying for ELICITS was the way to go here. This one was very winnable, all things considered.
