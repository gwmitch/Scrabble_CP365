#note PIA is probably very close to this. style?
>Julie: AJSW K5 JAWS +37 37
>Cesar: ADEIOOR L3 ADORE +28 44
#note this move took me a good amount of time. i either wanted to do L5 OI or this. i thought i liked 28 keeping OI rather than 13 keeping ADEOR since A and O together have been pissing me off recently. but 9E ROADIE sims best. *shrug*. i didn't want to get NOWed with the K i guess or maybe the P but that's a minor consideration. -3.5

>Cesar: EEIOOTV I6 VO.ITO +13 57
#note EMOTIVE is certainly better than my move, but i don't like the top simming N1 VOE. 7F VOTE looks pretty good too. -8.3

>Cesar: AEIIOST J10 OI +10 95
#note i'm like -- OK, now DON'T DRAW TWO VOWELS TO EIOST after YE, and then this. NOW DON'T DRAW TWO VOWELS TO AEIST.

#note pretty lame, milhouse. 10E TIP is the best play, not this phony atrocity (citatory). or FIT. -2
