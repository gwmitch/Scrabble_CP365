#note For a second I thought Chris had not only made the sevens unhookable, but not given me a letter for an eight.
>Chris_Lipe: ?EIIMRT 1H MIRT.IEr +158 190
#note "If it scores 100 and you're not 100%, challenge." That was my first thought: challenge. Then I spent the two minutes Chris was on hold talking myself into accepting, somehow convincing myself I'd seen MIRTHY* before, telling myself he wouldn't phony here (why not?). *headdesk*
>Jason: EIILNVW 5I WIV. +20 106
#note My premier brethren had a field day with MIRTHIER*. Sam K. clapped Bowman and me on the shoulder, said he was feeling mirthy and trying to make everybody else mirthier. Bradley said Lipe doesn't phony. "Bullsh*t!" I exclaimed (I also screwed myself against Chris by letting his GAUGEING* go in Elyria). "That's all he f*cking does!" Chris rebutted: "I really don't phony, I just get confused. And I seem to get confused more often against people with a reputation for keeping phonies on." Then he laughed. I tell you, people should be glad I had six wins at this point; if I'd had Winter's record, people would've gotten socked in the mouth. :)

#note Frick! (E)mBLAZER is good! At this stage, I probably should've tried it. Or (G)RaZABLE. Or BLAZ(O)nER (which I just got to in prob. study, dammit).

#note Best, says CP. No need to fish by playing QI at 3C ... the A's and E's will probably come right back.
>Chris_Lipe: ADEEIOO 15J O.E +18 407
#note Chris regretted not playing (R)ADIO here. But this play does have the benefit of leaving seven in the bag; should I bingo, I empty on the number.
>Jason: BEILNRS O8 BERLINS +96 407
#note CP puts me at about 23%, but it's more if you consider that Chris' last play telegraphs that he's X-less.
>Chris_Lipe: ADEFIOX C11 FAXED +39 446
#note Even with all my failings, I might've won had Chris not pulled FX out of the bag and left all the vowels for me. Oh well. I knew I couldn't go 15 games without blowing one, but it was a pity I was so close to doing it before a very poorly timed brain fart.
