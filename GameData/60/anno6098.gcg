>Cesar: CILQRVX F8 .IX +29 29
#note i don't know what the hell kind of play this was. CLEARLY QI 9C is better than what i did. i think i was just nervous. 7H QI sims highest (how come?) -8
>Pearl: ADNU D8 .AUND +16 42
>Cesar: CEELQRV H7 Q. +11 40
#note i wouldn't have been in this awkward situation if i had done QI earlier. grossly enough, this play does barely sim higher, but man does this blow.
>Pearl: APY 13C PYA +28 70
>Cesar: CEEELRV 14A VEE +16 56
#note ok time to start being insane. does anyone see anything that's halfway good here? quackle likes 14A EVE better, which seems to me more insane, but it may be less insane. i don't know? 10B ECU sims best, which i would never do in a million years because i hate Vs, but LEVER looks nice. -3.5
>Pearl: AHNW 15B HWAN +24 94
>Cesar: BEEGLRT 11A BLE.T +14 70
#note how nervous was i? GENET is an easy as hell find and so is TREBLE. sheesh.  -12

#note i ran my clock down to 12 minutes looking for something reasonable. this sucks..

#note i didn't think croziers was a word. so many word knowledge holes. -16
>Pearl: ABK 6J KAB +41 221
>Cesar: ADLNNOV 8L ANON +26 174
#note 8L LOAN is obviously better, but E5 VODUN is so nice. -4
>Pearl: GH K4 GH.. +16 237
#note i'm not sure if this meant he had the blank

>Cesar: DEILMOR 10I OM +22 317
#note why are you teasing me, Tile Gods? i maybe should have tried to open another bingo lane here, because the H column is way too easy to block and i'm significantly more unlikely to go at 13 or O.  what is better with this pool and board: MILER or DEILR?  turns out i picked the wrong one. (but quackly likes it!)
>Pearl: ?AIINRY 1H .RAIN +7 349
#note so what's the chances he's letting me have the bingo
>Cesar: DEILPRS 13I PRESID +38 355
#note i play phony cuz he blocked my parslied :( if i'd done OD, i would have had PRELIMS. oh well
>Pearl: ?IOY 4K .OYIm +16 365
#note of course he can't challenge on the tiny chance that it's good (hey it sounds slightly plausible, what am i thinking of?)
