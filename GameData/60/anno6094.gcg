#note that was fortunate. 12A DUVET is righter, but really? seems like an easy way to do lanated and dump the whole thing or something. -18

#note C12 REV sims best, but i am too paranoid. rectal has a higher chance of her not bingoing, right? what's so bad about it. (4.8% vs 39%!!) (-4.5)

#note it's probably reasonable to infer another E for her, so LATE.

#note 6K RIA does what I'm trying to do (and I don't really know what I'm trying to do) much better. i could probably do C12 RIG too, even though it'd telegraph the blank.. big deal. -9.5

#note 7B OI is totally fine. i even remember thinking about how clever it was, yet, i still didn't play it?! -1.5%

>Cesar: ?DILOSS --  -16 363
#note ok, so all i have to do is basically make a valid play. -35! 6J GLIa is the best play because it also blocks TAHR. if she'd have found that i'd be totally screwed, because i'd have to find rEFOLDS with 12 seconds on my clock or whatever i had.

>Cesar: ?DILOSS B8 LIDOS +16 379
#note i had almost no time at this point and was freaking out, so i just thought to block LUTEA (not seeing TEGUA). r(EF)OLDS is best. -5
