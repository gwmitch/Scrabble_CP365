>Toh_Weibin: IKNRTXY 8G NIXY +28 28
#note This is where I lose and Quackle wins. CP suggests one spot to the left, opening a good score for my K next move (to the I or Y). Excellent strategy!
>Quackle: DDEEMQT 7H TEMED +28 28
>Toh_Weibin: EGIKRTZ K3 GRIZ. +30 58
#note I miss I(TEMED), which can be used for GI(N)K. Isn't that much better though.

>Quackle: ?AACEQS 5F ACEQu.AS +68 122
>Toh_Weibin: ?EOOPTT 9H TO +17 114
#note Was speed Quackling, but should really have played TOPO 9F or OTTO 8L (which I somehow dismissed because it ranked lower on Speedy). TO 9H is too cowardly. Either way, there is one play that's better than TOPO, OTTO or TO. See it?

>Toh_Weibin: BLOORSU 6D LOB +21 280
#note CP suggests OB 2I, to open up another scoring spot. The "I take one, you take one" mentality, which I feel may not be that wise with LLRRR in the bag.
>Quackle: CGIRUUU C6 GURU +14 304

#note SOUTERLY, UROSTYLE... damn what's the last one... OK it probably doesn't fit there anyway - oh wait!
>Quackle: ACIIJRU 8A JU.A +36 340
>Toh_Weibin: EEGILNR 12D GREEN +36 474
#note CP suggests a fish-block EL A12 is better by about 1 point.
