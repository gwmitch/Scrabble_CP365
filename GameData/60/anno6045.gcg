#note well that is pretty lucky. i probably shoulda counted rinsable/ruinable but just wanted to play a little defense. -5

#note i'm not sure if this is wrong. L1 REATA just ends the game quicker and lessens the chance of a comeback. i should probably take it.

#note i actually tried playing this endgame correctly but messed it up. i did surmise that GOTH was better than OATH but 4C AGIO is the best endgame. If I'd known spread would matter so much in the final result I really would have done the numbers, I should for practice anyway. -9
