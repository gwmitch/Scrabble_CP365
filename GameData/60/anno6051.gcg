#note zoea scores 87. this keeps an easier lane open for another bingo, which may have been scott's plan.

#note i was doing so well up to here. i saw gearless, talked myself out of it, then for no good reason played this. i guess i was thinking i should just burn through the tiles, shut down the lanes from 2h/2i and the right side of the board.  i spent a long time on this. my top 2 were this and eagles, same spot.  q still puts me at 90+% to win.

#note dogdoms 10b. i have maybe 3 minutes left at this point. this takes out non-existent scoring possibilities. i was also tracked badly. this only does bad things for myself, not for scott.  argh.
