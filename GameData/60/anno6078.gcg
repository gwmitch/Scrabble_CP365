#note i wanted to try PROMOLAR* . ORZO seems to be simming best. is MARL that strong? or is my move too risky. -2.5
>Esther: AUV N7 VAU +11 45
>Cesar: EILOOOR 7D ORIOLE +18 76
#note don't feel like i got much choice; my chances of getting nowed are pretty high. 7G OLEO sims better than my move, but i dislike it. i want to have an open board until i can get ahead.. right? -5.5
>Esther: AEPTU 8A TAUPE +39 84
#note a minor now, but still a now.

#note seinfeld is teaching me bad phonies that also sim badly. it's as if i suddenly forgot FOVEA was a word (or REGIVE for that matter). -5.5

>Cesar: EILNOOV C2 VOIL. +16 149
#note i don't like C12 plays not because i'm afraid of a 3-3 but because it is trivial for the board to become a closed nightmare and for me to lose any advantage i may have. VIOL sims highest there but i'll sacrifice 8 pts so that i can keep the board the way i like it. -2.5

#note it's a pretty good time to start freaking out and running around in circles. it's going to be a repeat of vancouver, where i start off big and then lose the next 5 games in a row! NOOOO! oh wait, this has to be better than COB.

#note i figured i had the K for JUNK - something so i better take the easiest spot and then JUNK the next turn. but KREWE is probably better than my move, and you know what, 4B HIKE may be too much to give up. my move sims second best to KREWE, which i'd take in retrospect :P -5.5

#note she counted it as 42.. damn, i really did lose this tourney! i need to get into the habit of recounting my opponent's plays -- i never do. also this really makes me wish i'd taken hike the last turn. quackle likes 12K ILEA or ALAE, i can't say i completely agree ... but it's close either way. -1

#note looking at that pool and after CUR i was completely crapping bricks. this was a bad situation. OLEA for the better leave, this is the second time i've chickened out on it. -4
