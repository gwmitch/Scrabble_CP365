>Jerry_Lerman: AIIL J6 AI.LI +9 9
>Jason: OORTTVY 9E RYOT +20 42
#note TROTY(L)?! I hate words.
>Jerry_Lerman: AW 10F AW +27 36
>Jason: EINOPTV E5 VIPE. +20 62
#note I think I got too obsessed with closing things down and playing defense. Jerry's play doesn't necessarily mean "awesome leave." OVER(T)IP or OVINE is fine.
>Jerry_Lerman: BEGR 8A GREB. +33 69
>Jason: KNNORTZ 11C ZONK +44 106
>Jerry_Lerman: OY 12D YO +22 91
>Jason: ?ENRTTV 6G TEV.TRoN +62 168
#note Jerry was disappointed this blocked ENL(A)RGED and he said in the post-mortem that just before I announced the score his hearing aid went out. "I'm thinking 'this is not a good omen,'" he said. 
>Jerry_Lerman: DEEGLNR M5 G.LDENER +61 152
#note But he recovered, as you can see.
>Jason: AAAADNS -AAA +0 168
#note ASANA/(TEVATRoN)S! Bah.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADIORS O1 RADIOS +35 187
>Jason: ADEHNQS 6B QAD. +34 202

>Jason: AAEGHNS L3 HA +23 225
>Jerry_Lerman: OPU L10 UPO +20 225
>Jason: AEGMNST 13E MAGNETS +68 293
#note MAGN(E)T(IT)ES might've kept my high non-bingo of ZENITH for 76 vs. Weinstein intact. But, being human, I play this and think I'm in great shape up a bingo on a lousy board.
>Jerry_Lerman: AELTX 14B LATEX +87 312
#note Screwed by LATEX ... write your own joke here.
>Jason: AEIMORS N1 AMI +23 316
#note RIMOSE and RAMOSE! Dammit! That would've made it so hard for Jerry to come back! (With -LY I know them as bingos...)
>Jerry_Lerman: EHI 15A HIE +22 334
>Jason: EENORSU 15F EURO +22 338
#note CP likes leaving two in the bag with ENSURE/ENURES (43% vs. 33% for this). IDK.
>Jerry_Lerman: S G8 ...S +32 366
>Jason: EEFLNSW 8M .EW +21 359
#note Saving FLENSE for next turn, with an off chance of bingoing should he play to that E. CP's pick of WEN at N11 is intriguing.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?CEFIOU H1 CUIFf. +42 408
>Jerry_Lerman: ?CEFIOU --  -42 366
#note A ray of hope...
>Jason: EFLNNST H1 FLENS. +30 389
#note This wins if the O is in the bag (which it should be, logically, given that Jerry didn't play COIFfE) ... with the E in the bag I force Jerry to find FUCOIDa(L) or play for a tie. But noo ... stupid D.
>Jerry_Lerman: ?CEFIOU 2A vOICEFU. +90 456
#note Jerry has a handful of wins, but gave me another ray of hope when he put this down, designated the blank, picked it up saying "I'm not sure it's good," but then, having no time, put it down again. Alas. Left to lament my own failings like TROTYL, RIMOSE/RAMOSE, etc.
