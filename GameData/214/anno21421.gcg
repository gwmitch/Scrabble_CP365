#note Tasha Warms Up For Nationals, Episode 1.  This is a casual game played the night before Nationals.  Anyways, feast your eyes on this excellent gravity-defying opening play.  John immediately pointed out my bimboity.  For the record, ANNEX is the best play, though.

#note John holds, but rightly doesn't challenge.  But I'm so rusty that I was actually questioning myself.  However, I agreed with him when he said that I couldn't have made that word up.

#note I considered ZOWIE, but passed it up because it's counter-productive.  It's a close game and 54 points won't matter much if my opponent scores 40 the next turn.
