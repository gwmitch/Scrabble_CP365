#note Same deal with AXIAL here. 

I feel that Chris' odds of having a bingo beginning with an S are significantly higher than the odds that he has one with an A as the second letter, especially after his last play, so I think I'm helping myself here by blocking this. I play JALAP next turn, kill the board, score a bunch, and end the game unless he has a bingo with the pattern ?A?????. 

Even without putting in rack inferrence of S, Q says that he is more likely to bingo beginning with an S by 4.5%.

#note And I'm sunk. He has ORPIMENT on bottom or MERINOS on top. 

Should have known AXIAL didn't take an S.
