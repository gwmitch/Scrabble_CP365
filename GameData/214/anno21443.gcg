#note QUA also takes a G.  Maybe I should have just played GLUG?

#note This wouldn't be happening had I played GLUG on column J.

#note I can't remember my rack.  I remember I had an S because I thought of burning it for more points.  I probably had about 7 I's.

>Tasha: ADEIMTX 14D MAX +59 365
#note Had he blocked the big X play, I would have played ADMIXT.  Anyways,  he took forever on DEL and I seriously had to go to the bathroom.  I started squirming in my seat.  I never went to the bathroom before during a game, so I was kind of worried about protocol.  I decided to just not draw tiles until I return.  I played MAX quickly and I said "I'm sorry but I got to go."  When I returned, that SNOOTED crap was on the board.  :(
>Mark_Miller: DENOOST N9 SNOOTED +74 417
>Tasha: AADEINT O12 DINE +39 404
#note I held SNOOTED, but I think I was more annoyed than anything.  SNOOT is a verb so of course SNOOTED is good.  I remembered that I had to draw three more tiles and then I let the play go.  Even if it's phony, I can still win.  Anyways, I played DINE.  Then DATA.  Then I decided on DINE because I felt that my A's would do better with the remaining pool.
>Mark_Miller: ABBILRT 13B BLAB +26 443
#note I was surprised Mark emptied the bag, but he said he didn't see any bingos in the pool.  He said he drew IIVW after this play so this is his actual rack.  He was focused on blocking big plays on row 13 (like VAW maybe) and didn't expect any bingoes.
