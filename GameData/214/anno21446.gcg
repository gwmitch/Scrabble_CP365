>Will_Anderson: IWZ 8G WIZ +30 30
>Reid: CHIOOPU 7E COOP +19 19
#note OUZO and CUZ at I6 are #1 (38.63%) and #3 (36.09%). I had forgotten CUZ was now valid. UPO at 9E is #2 (36.14%). My play is #12 (34.08%). OUZO is too weak defensively. I should have played UPO. Getting rid of double letter and the U is more my style. Medium sized mistake here. 
>Will_Anderson: FILUV E2 FULVI. +28 58
>Will_Anderson: FILUV --  -28 30
#note Will tries an admitted phoney. I was a bit surprised, because he didn't seem like the type. He told me that other players had been encouraging him to try more phoneys. 
>Reid: GHIMNUY 6F MY +32 51
#note HM is #1 (51%). YUCH at E5 is #2 (50.90%). My play is #3 (50.41%). I disagree with Quackle here. I hate the YU leave. This is not really a mistake. 
>Will_Anderson: ACILV 9H CAVIL +30 60
>Reid: DGHINOU L7 HO.DING +26 77
#note COUGH at E7 is #1 (48.32%). LOUGH at L9 is #3 (45.65%). My play is #2 (46.12%). I agree w/ Quackle here. I wanted to get rid of my U. COUGH has a nice leave. 
>Will_Anderson: ?EEEIOR -?EEEIO +0 60
>Reid: ADEILOU 13G DIALO.UE +76 153
#note #1 play. 
>Will_Anderson: AEGLORT O7 GLOATER +88 148
#note Will gets the easy bingo retort.
>Reid: EJMQTVX 12F VEX +41 194
#note JIVE at H12 is #1 (67.88%). VEXT is #2 (57.82%). VEX at 10G is #3 (57.07%). I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out how I missed JIVE. I think I got too focused on dumping the V and X. My play is #5 (52.44%).  This is a huge mistake. 
>Will_Anderson: ?GINRRS M3 RINGeRS +84 232
>Reid: AJMNQTU 4K UM.AQ +52 246
#note QUOTA at K11 is #1 (44.61%). JAM at L2 is #3 (40.53%). My play is #2 (41.70%). I disagree with Quackle here. I like my play better. 
>Will_Anderson: AET H11 A..TE +36 268
#note Will makes good use of my JIVE mistake from earlier.
>Reid: ?FIJNTW N12 F.W +23 269
#note WEFT is #1 (60.25%). FINE at N10 is #2 (58.24%). FUJI at K3 is #3 (58.07%). Missing FUJI is a small mistake. I got too focused on trying to dump the W. My play is #4 (58.07%). I'm okay with my play here.
>Will_Anderson: OPU 5J UPO. +24 292
>Reid: ?ABIJNT 11K J.B +24 293
#note JIbBA or JIBbA at 2J are the top 2 (68.36%, 67.90%). My play is #3 (65.68%). I dont consider my play to be a mistak. The win percentages differences aren't that great. This is is more of a preference. 
>Will_Anderson: DEIINRS D5 INSIDER +68 360
>Reid: ?AINTTU 15A AuTUNIT. +74 367
#note TUNICATE and INTUBATE are #1 and #3 (40.53%, 40.01%). My play is #2 (40.09%).
>Will_Anderson: EEKNOT C8 KETONE +36 396
#note Beautiful play.
>Reid: BEEHNOT 14D NOH +31 398
#note EH at 14E or 6I are #1 (34.97%) and #2 (32.33%). HERB at 3K is #3 (31.93%). My play is #8 (30.25%). I should have played at least 1 E here. I agree with Quackle. This is a small mistake though. 
>Will_Anderson: EY I5 YE +15 411
>Reid: BEEILST 2M BE +18 416
#note This was the most important play of the game. TAE at I12 is #1 (91.07%). ETA at I11 is #2 (90.87%). ET at E10 is #3 (86.42%). My choice is #7 (74.17%). There is a huge difference in win percentage here. I would have thought TILES was a better leave than BILES. I think the point difference is the clincher here.
>Will_Anderson: AFS 12A FA.S +40 451
>Reid: AAEILST B6 TESLA +25 441
#note Drawing the R or D here wins the game.  ILEA, TILE and SIAL at 4F are the top 3 based on valuations from 5 min champ. I didn't even see Will's out even though I tracked properly. Assuming optimal play from this point out, ILEA reduces spread to 19, TILE to 22, and SIAL to 23. SEALIFT and ITSELF are top 2 based on valuations of all plays. My play is #3. 
>Will_Anderson: DEERR E1 ERRED +18 469
>Will_Anderson:  (AI) +4 473
#note This game was incorrectly scored officially as 470-441. On the bright side, I didn't miss any bingos. 8 of my 12 plays were in the top 5. 10 of 12 in the top 8. The biggest mistake was missing JIVE. That move left a worse leave and gave up over 20 points of equity. Playing it would have blocked AXITE. A closer game would have made the end game more important. Overall, I give myself a B+ this game. I had tougher racks than Will, but this game was winnable.
