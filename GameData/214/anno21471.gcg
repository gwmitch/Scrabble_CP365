#note Well, I considered practically every other competitive option here, but settled on this - it seemed like not a lot of vowels had been played (only 7 to this point compared to 22 consonants) and most of the other plays opened things up that gave me varying degrees of discomfort. I think in hindsight I still don't mind this but the one play I can unquestionably say is better is L3 CLEG.

>Will: CIIOOTW H1 OW +28 279
#note Tossup with TWO. Nine points is a lot, but the T is much more hittable than the O.
>Jesse: DEILOTV B10 VOI.E +36 199
>Will: CEIIIOT A14 OI +8 287
#note I did see PION, but I felt forced to address the new spot.
>Jesse: DELSTTV D12 V.D +14 213
>Will: ACEIITU 11A I.TA +12 299
#note In retrospect I really like 15D ETUI here, and really don't see why I spent one of my consonants when I could have played AI instead. 
>Jesse: AEILSTT 7E TI +13 226
>Will: ACEIKUY 9E YAU. +19 318
#note I didn't see RICKEY at all, but I don't think it's correct here anyway. A very interesting play is 9J UNAI, which is a great, counter-intuitive block of the column N bingo line. I really like my play here, though, especially against racks where Jesse has drawn the Z after VID or TI and can easily nail me with 80 points from 8A.
>Jesse: AAELRST 8D AR +9 235
>Will: BCEEHIK L10 .EBECK +40 358
#note I missed KEBAR, which is unquestionably the play here.
>Jesse: AEILOST C2 ISOLATE +69 304
>Will: HIORSUU B7 UH +14 372
#note Well, it's nice to make at least one good play on the live stream. I needed something that would help me counter worst case ZOCALO type scenarios.
