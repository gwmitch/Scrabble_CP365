>Jackson_Smylie: AEIRTWX 8D WAXIER +40 40
#note terrible play by moi, which I only realized after I hit my clock. Not only did I doubt myself on REWAX, I played long on the opening turn after his exch. 2. WAX, with only slightly worse equity than the other X plays, seems clearly best.

>Tony_Leah: BOO 7D OBO +23 91
>Jackson_Smylie: ACEIMPS 6D CAP +44 130
#note CAMPERIES is a word. This was a pretty perfect rack for his OBO play.
>Tony_Leah: ADHS 6K DASH +42 133
>Jackson_Smylie: EGIMOQS 9H GEM +17 147
#note this might be too cute, QI/DASHI wins the sim. after QI I didn't see any way to score a lot of points, but GEM is very likely to give me QIS. I could also draw into QADI and save the I. I do like GEM, although losing the sim by 11 makes me unsure.
>Tony_Leah: FLOOR M6 ...FLOOR +30 163
>Jackson_Smylie: AEFIOQS K4 QA.. +28 175
#note might be the wrong idea... EFIOS hits SEAFLOORS for a lot of points pretty often (R or T draws), and otherwise I could hit QI. Quackle likes playing FAQIR, but I'm not sure how strong EOS is here. Maybe just play QIS and grab the points. They all sim within a point of each other.

#note well I missed a high prob triple triple.

#note I'm going for the ZEST draw, but playing CUZ right now might be better. I didn't even see it.

#note COWGIRL to keep the N over the R perhaps.
>Tony_Leah: DO 11J DO.. +24 394
>Jackson_Smylie: ?EIRSTT 2I TIT.R +20 396
#note I saw TRINKETS and STINTERS, but WINTERLY, MURRINES, and UNWISELY could play for the win. TITER puts scoring pressure and bingo pressure on (even though with UUUWY in the pool a bingo may not be likely). N1 STIE is nice to put more scoring pressure on. RITE is champ's choice in the same spot, then TI right behind. RITE I feel can be blocked too easily with easy YUM plays, but TI is okay. I'd prefer to give myself the main option of outrunning here, while possibly forcing tony to make a play along the 3 row.

#note uncowling. Quite the sloppy game by me, from beginning to end.
