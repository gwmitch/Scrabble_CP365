#note #1 play.
>Judy_Newhouse: ARW I6 WAR. +25 57
>Reid: AEGHOPV J5 HOP +31 51
#note VEGA and VOG at J5 are #1 (40.37%) and #3 (39.76%). PHAGE at 8A is #2 (39.81%). My play is #6 (37.79%). I really like VOG but the other two are good as well. I made a small mistake here. 
>Judy_Newhouse: ?AEEORS 4F OvERSEA +73 130
#note SEROSAE is 77.

#note #1 play.
>Judy_Newhouse: NNO K3 N.ON +24 154
>Reid: ADJMOTX H1 JAD. +36 131
#note #1 play. I had considered MAXED, but it is #2. 
>Judy_Newhouse: ARTU 1H .URAT +13 167
>Reid: AHMOOTX 5C HOAX +37 168
#note HOM at 9A is #1 (41.33%). OX and OH at 9B are #2 (39.91%) and #3 (39.88%). My play is #4 (37.76%). This is small mistake. I prefer OX to HOM myself. Apparently, I had left my HOM at home because I forgot about it.

>Reid: AMOOTUV 2L OVUM +20 188
#note Wasn't sure about this play but it sims as #1.
>Judy_Newhouse: BNO 9A NOB +20 222
>Reid: AEIOPTT O1 O.IT +21 209
#note OPIATE at 2E is #1 (31.59%). TOiT at 10B is #2 (30.99%). ATOP at 6D is #3 (30.87%). My play is #6 (29.75%). This is a minor mistake. ATOP would be great if there weren't so many I out. I need to play an I here. TOIT is pretty volatile. OPIATE is good for turnover. 
>Judy_Newhouse: EST M2 .EST +21 243
#note Nice to be able to use an ess for 21 points. She probably had two.
>Reid: ACDEPTT 7A PAC +29 238
#note DEP and DAP at 3C are #1 (35.23%) and #2 (33.25%). My play is #3 (32.84%). I didn't want to keep both T, but had to take the points.
>Judy_Newhouse: EEGINST F8 S.EETING +73 316
>Reid: DELNRTT 15F .ELT +15 253
#note ALT at L4 is #1 (10.95%). DELFT at A1 is #2 (10.67%). DEL at 3C is #3 (9.53%). I saw a few others in the top 15 but my play is not in there. I was trying to take away the triple. I didn't want to use my E. I like DELFT for leave and turnover and points. My play is #38 base on valuations from all plays. This is the biggest mistake thus far.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?DEEIRW 11D tW.EDIER +94 410
#note And that's the game folks.
>Reid: DELLNRT 10J DELL +18 271
#note TELL at J10 is #1 (0.07%). DELT at 12J is #2 (0.03%) and DELL at 3C is #3 (0.00). I love DELL for points and I missed it. I wanted to create another lane and hope to pull the last ess. I really didn't want to use my E. TELL has a great leave but blocks lanes and scores poorly. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ, but it is #5 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Judy_Newhouse: BCINO 13B BION.C +26 436
>Reid: AINQRST C12 Q. +11 282
#note DELL at 12J is looking much better now. I figured with so many I out that I would be able to draw one and play INTARSIA at A2. My play is #1.
>Judy_Newhouse: DEIIIMY N10 YID +32 468
#note YID is nice scoring block.
>Reid: AIINRST 2A INTARSI. +70 352
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (MEII) +12 364
#note Game was incorrectly scored as 467-364. I didn't miss any bingos. 10 of my12  plays were in the top 6. 6 plays were #1. The GELT turn was my biggest mistake. All in all, I played pretty well; this was an unwinnable game. I give myself an A-
