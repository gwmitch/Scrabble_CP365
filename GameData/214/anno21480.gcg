>Reid: ABGIMST H4 GAMBITS +78 78
#note #1 play. 
>Conrad: HLOO I3 HOLO +20 20
>Reid: ?ABIIPR J6 PIA +24 102
#note ABRI or BI at J5 are #1 (88.79%) and #3 (87.95%). BI at J6 is #2 (88.65%). My play is #8 (87.52%). This is a minor mistake if at all.
>Conrad: EGOUV K2 VOGUE +26 46
>Reid: ?AABINR K8 BANI +16 118
#note I was worried that I had missed a bingo this turn and I was right. BARGAIN at K8 is #1 (91.90%), BARTISAN at 9E is #2 (91.24%) and ABRASION at 10D is #3 (90.25%). CARABINS is also playable. My play is #8 (87.95%). This was a huge mistake. 
>Conrad: FFRU L9 RUFF +29 75
>Reid: ?AELMRR M7 ARM +17 135
#note RAMBLER, MARLIER, MARBLER at 13G are top 3 (93.59%, 92.95%, 92.94%). I saw MARLIER but missed the RUFF hook. I missed the other bingos. Another huge mistake. My play is #10 (86.09%).
>Conrad: HIT L3 HIT +25 100
>Reid: ?ELORTW N1 TROWELs +73 208
#note TROWELS at 13H is #1 (93.34%). WHORTLE or FELWORT at N1 are #2 (91.12%) and #3 (90.66%). My play is #5 (90.11%). This is a small mistake. I didn't see the other bingos.
>Conrad: AACDERR 13G ARCADER +89 189
#note I held on this play but because of RUFFE and not ARCADER. I figured ARCADER was one of the new ones. Conrad gets a phoney past me. 
>Reid: CEINOUX H12 C.UX +48 256
#note #1 play. 
>Conrad: AGINPY O7 PAYING +46 235
>Reid: DEIINOV 1L VE.O +33 289
#note #1 play. I didn't like keeping both I or using my E, but there are lots of E left and I needed the points and to block the spot.
>Conrad: ?DEEEIN 15D EnDE.INE +66 301
>Reid: EIIKNOW 14B KIWI +28 317
#note KI at N10 is #1 (57.40%). WO and WE at 14J are #2 (52.57%) and #3 (46.74%). I considered WO but didn't want to stick with double I. In hindsight, this is a big mistake, but at the time I didn't think it was that bad. I agree with Quackle here. I like KI. My play is #9 (41.45%)
>Conrad: DEOSZ 10D DOZE. +35 336
#note SEZ at 13C is 45.
>Reid: AEELNOO N10 OE +10 327
#note NOODLe at D7 is #1 (39.43%). LEA at 13C is #2 (31.67%). ALOE at 13B is #3 (31.57%). My play is #11 (25.17%). I was worried about a QI play putting the game out of reach. Quackle thinks this is a big mistake, I'm not so sure.
>Conrad: NY E9 Y.N +12 348
>Reid: AEJLNNO 9C JO. +24 351
#note LODEN, NODAL, LADEN at D8 are top 3 (35.30%, 32.03%, 29.25%). I think Quackle likes the setup for the double letter for the J at C9. My play is #7 (22.67%).
>Conrad: Q C13 Q. +22 370
>Reid: AEILNNT 12D LINA. +23 374
#note NODEL or LODEN at D8 are #1 (41.40%) and #3 (32.67%). NET at O3 is #2 (39.00%). My play is #8 (24.42%).
>Conrad: DESSU 14K USED +28 398
>Reid: AEELNST G7 ALE. +16 390
#note HITS at L3 wins the game here. LA at 15A is #2, TEL at 15M is #3. My play is tied for #4.
>Conrad: RSTT L3 ...S +16 414
>Reid: ENST F4 NETS +11 401
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (RTT) +6 407
#note 2 missed bingos. A missed phoney. Poor end game. 12 of 13 plays in the top 10, but only 6 in the top 5. Overall, I give myself an D-/F this game. This game could have been won early and I still had a chance at the end if more thought had been put into the end game. I had plenty of time, just didn't use it.
