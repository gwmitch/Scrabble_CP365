>Will: AABLOST 5E ABO +22 167
#note A good equity play, but the board is not very good for bingoing at all even without ABO clogging things up. Still, no option really distinguishes itself. Perhaps 5K BAAL or BOAT setting up the case S for scoring rather than bingoing makes some sense - never remotely crossed my mind.

>Will: DEINRST N10 N.T +19 226
#note It was either this or G4 TOP. I took some extra points, but this is not the board I need at all.
>Jesse: BDENO 5K BONED +26 282
>Will: DEEIRSY 4L DEY +29 255
#note 13A DEY sims well but it's tough to see how that helps me much. At least with 4L DEY there's some chance of opening the board further with the right draw. Also, with JKQXZ all unseen, the possibility of drawing some sequence of those and getting back into the game via scoring seemed at least as likely as bingoing on this awful board.

#note Not loving keeping UW, but 42 points is a lot.
>Jesse: AADEGRT 4B GRADATE +84 428
#note Ouch. This one stung pretty bad - losing the game was one thing, but that much extra spread was going to hurt in game 4.
>Will: EQRSTUW B6 QU.T +35 365
#note The best thing I could see to do was to play D2 QUA and try for WASTRIE in two places, and maybe catch him with some combo of JZ - but the chances of that succeeding vs. the chances of making my spread too horrible to come back from in the next game didn't support going for it.

#note E9 SWING blocking AZON was best, though it doesn't go out - REC/QUITE scores enough that it's worth it.
