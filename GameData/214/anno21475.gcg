#note Interesting call with where to put this. Avoiding slotting a vowel next to the DLS by putting a Y next to it instead kind of defeats the purpose, as B and M plays are still gonna score nicely there.

#note Very interesting move. The 40 point Q bomb is just sitting there, but it's also the only place the Q seems to play on this board (apart from QIS/VERMEILS, which only I can play), and with a lead/tempo, I should be able to withstand QI if Panupol has it unless he then comes back with a bingo, and hopefully I can block that. I wouldn't put it past Panupol to have the H when he played WOVE, so I'm also concerned about devastating scoring plays on row 1. To me, the choices are WELTED, LIEFEST, and D7 EFT, with honorable mention to 10M plays making LICENSED/LICENSEE, and WELTED does the best job of ensuring that I'll be able to shed the Q while also blocking some scary WH- scoring threats. After LIEFEST I could easily imagine drawing a Q that doesn't play anywhere and being in trouble.
