>Reid: BIISTTV H7 BIT +10 10
#note My play is #15 (48.76%). I saw VIBIST but didn't want to use my ess. VIBIST at 8D, 8H, and 8E are the top three. (55.70%, 53.37%, 53.12%). I'm okay with my play here. I didn't like keeping the V though.
>Nick_Meyer: OOP 6F POO +17 17
>Reid: DEISTVY I4 TIDY +30 40
#note #1 play.
>Nick_Meyer: AAIR H1 ARIA +18 35
>Reid: CEINRSV 2H .EV +14 54
#note VAT and CAT at 4G are #1 (63.29%) and #3 (61.19%). The leaves are just too strong. I considered VAC at 1G, #2 (61.35%) but it felt like wasting the higher valued tiles. I really didn't want to play my E and Quackle agrees that it shouldn't have been played. My play is #13 (58.19%). I'm okay with my play and I don't consider this a huge mistake. I almost played SCRIVEN but though better of it.
>Nick_Meyer: RW 1G R.W +11 46
>Reid: CINORST 10F CISTRON +74 128
#note My play is #3 (79.48%). Quackle likes CITRONS at 10B more (76.9%). #1 is CROSTINI at 8A (82.03%). I felt proud of my play until just now. This is a medium sized mistake. Nick held for over 3 minutes on this play and I was really hoping he would challenge. I was a bit surprised because it seems like a common bingo.
>Nick_Meyer: AEGIRST K2 STAGIER +73 119
#note GANISTER and GANTRIES score one more point but I think Nick made the right choice here.
>Reid: AHNRUVW 11K HAW +30 158
#note My play is #2 (54.08%). HUN is #1 (54.54%). WAUR is #3 (53.80%). I think Quackle, like me, really hates the UW combo. I considered WAUR but wanted to keep at least 1 vowel.
>Nick_Meyer: HOO 12K OHO +35 154
>Reid: ALNORUV G3 ARV. +14 172
#note NAV at 13M is #1 (50.63%). ULVA at 7C is #2 (49.70%). VAU at 5D is #3 (48.93%). Not sure why I missed VAU. It certainly fit my goal that turn. I wanted to get rid of VU and keep the R. It also would have opened open that side of the board. My play is not in the top 15 according to 5 min champ. My play is #24 based on valuations of all plays. I agree w/ Quackle. This was a poor play. Didn't seem that bad at the time.
>Nick_Meyer: EEIT 8K .ETIE +18 172
>Reid: FLNOUUX 3K .UX +20 192
#note OX at L3 is #1 (48.97%). While the points are nice, I'm not comfortable keeping UU in my rack. FLUXION at N4 is #2 (48.96%). I like this play for its turnover, but didn't see it. WOFUL at M11 is tied for #2 but is too risky and AFOUL at 4K is #3 (47.59%). My play is #8 (45.73%). I think this is a minor mistake and I'm okay w/ my play here.
>Nick_Meyer: DEINOPU F8 UN.OPIED +65 237
#note Nick sneaks a phoney by me. I could have sworn it was a new word. This mistake likely cost me the game.
>Reid: AEFLNOU 15A LOAFE. +42 234
#note #1 play. I almost played FOULED but took the points instead.
>Nick_Meyer: DEJMU 12C JUM.ED +40 277
>Reid: BEINSUZ J12 BIZ +43 277
#note BIZE is #1 (34.51%). JUBA at C12 is #2 (34.37%) and much safer than my play. I went for the points w/ BIZ at #3 (33.72%).  I like JUBA, but i missed it. This is not a big mistake.
>Nick_Meyer: ADELRST O7 R.SLATED +60 337
>Reid: EFGNNSU 15J ENUF +23 300
#note My play is #2 (8.58%). I had considered #1 FEN at 15I (10.43%) but I wanted to get rid of the U. GENU at 15I is #3 (7.25%). 
>Nick_Meyer: AEE 9E E.A.E +13 350
#note I figured that with this setup, Nick had at least one blank and the ess. He has both blanks.
>Reid: CGKLNNS D10 GN. +4 304
#note NUG and GUN at D11 are #1 (22.37%) and #2 920.40%). NEG at 14E is #3 (19.40%). Quackle optimistically thinks that I can pull some blanks I guess. This game is unwinnable unless I bingo this turn and that is not happening. My play is unsuprisingly not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. I was merely trying to block Nick's impending bingo to reduce spread. My play is #4 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Nick_Meyer: ??EGILM C4 MEGIlLa +62 412
#note Quackle didn't show this bingo for some reason. I'm using a jerry-rigged Quackle with the new dictionary but the old OWL2 leaves.
>Reid: ACKLNNS H12 .ANK +27 331
#note ANI and ANIS at 7A are #1 and #3. NIL at 7B is #2. I like NIL and am now just beginning to see how stupid my end game was. I was just trying to block the highest scoring QI play, but I could have given myself an out with CLANKS. My play is not even in the top 15 for 5 min champ. It is #4 based on valuations of all plays but it's a horrible play. 
>Nick_Meyer: OQY 7B Q. +11 423
>Reid: CLNS 5B C.LS +12 343
#note #1 play only because my previous play was so poor.
>Nick_Meyer: OY 13B YO +28 451
>Nick_Meyer:  (N) +2 453
#note 7 of 13 plays were in the top 3.  8 of 13 in the top 8. Missing the phoney and a very sloppy end game cost me the game or at least a much tighter spread. Overall, I give myself a D+ for this game. This was a potentially winnable game even though at the time I blamed it on the tiles. The only bright side was that I did not miss any bingos.
