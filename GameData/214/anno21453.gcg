>Will: ?AAOSTU 8E AUTO +8 8
#note No real reason for 8E other than avoiding a vowel next to DLS and not wanting to waste energy thinking of AUTO- extensions...
>Jason: AEINNRT 9B TRANNIE +68 68
>Will: ?AGHNRS 10H SHARiNG +69 77
#note Safer than STAGHORN which I admittedly did not see.

>Will: EEEHMOT 13H THEO.EM +32 192
#note Oof, bad miss of HOME/HEME. A couple points of equity but a lot of scoreboard points...
>Jason: BDELOST 12D BOLDEST +82 220
#note ...not just because of the 6 extra he gets on this turn, but on the many, many more that I get after BOLDEST 14G instead.
>Will: DEEGIKR 2J KER.ED +46 238
>Jason: AY 1N YA +29 249
>Will: CEGIIOU 8A GIE +16 254
#note Almost did C6 GUIRO and almost exchanged to CE, which Championship Player favors. My play was kind of a play without a rationale, other than grabbing desperately at points; but I'm not seeing anything amazing here.
>Jason: AIINP 13B PIANI +22 271
>Will: ACIOUUV -IOUUV +0 254
#note 11C VAC and J6 VACUA leaving only vowels, or exchanging...another toughie. But playing has the edge because of the major consonant overload in the unseen tiles.
>Jason: IQ 3I QI +27 298
>Will: ACLORSZ 1E COLZAS +58 312
#note Really tough decision for Jason with the different locations of QI. I think he chose right and I happened to have a negative-outcome rack for him.
>Jason: FOP 7C FOP +27 325
>Will: ADIILRV 4H VID +31 343
#note Thought about all the plays along row 4 and their various strong and weak points. LIVID makes a new, easier-to-hit spot for the X, but keeps the wieldiest leave. AVID makes an easy sevens lane and a decent scoring spot, so VID seemed better. I again missed the K5 spot, this time with DIVA, which sims best - it does score the most and blocks both the easy place to play YOM as well as plays like the one Jason ended up making, while still retaining an I for XI if I pick it or subsequent QI plays. Again, I didn't consider that every extra tile I pick here is important to try and snag that blank. Something like VALID or VIRID is still better than VID if I'm frightened by LIVID or AVID.

>Will: AILLRUW 14I AW +33 376
#note 7H WAUL is a very interesting play, blocking the tricky row 6 bingo line and setting up a second place for a potential X bomb if I draw it. The play I made is really not very good. I was hoping to create a situation whereby I could win against an X bomb by drawing the blank and against a high scoring play on the newly created line with an X bomb, but instead I minimize my chance of getting X? by using only two tiles and create a very nice bingo line where none had previously existed, one which he is probably much more likely than I am to hit. If I want to take the scoring tack, the play is definitely 11C LAW instead.

>Will: EILLRUX 2F XI +52 428
#note I can still win if I draw the Y.
>Jason: EEITUUY 3F YE +23 451
>Will: ELLORU N10 .LU.E +16 444
#note 14D LO setting up LURE/RULE works out 4 better.
>Jason: EITUU 5E ETUI +14 465
>Will: LOR 4C LOR +8 452
#note Saw ROLFER, put this on board with 0:00 so no time to count. Didn't maximize my chances in this game.
