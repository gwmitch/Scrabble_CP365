#note Think this is a bit better after x2. (Actually, why not at 8F after exchange 2? Slotting it there might cut down on a handful of sevens ending in S. But exchanging is probably most bingo-defensive of any move I can do.)

#note Okay, very straightforward game to this point, but this was kind of interesting. The trick here is to figure out likelihoods that Bruce will see and know PULSOJET and whether he will try something like OUTJETS* instead of just JOUST. Obviously seeing PULSOJET would be pretty impressive but if I block JOUST too well or just play the straightforward O7 FE,  I won't get any phony action. All that being said I think the right play here is 14I EF or something similar, because at least I still win after the worst case scenario of the gigantic PULSOJET, and I block the easy JOUST while still allowing Bruce to try a doomed hail mary on me.
