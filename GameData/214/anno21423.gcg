#note I seriously did this.  I tried to come up with some excuse to explain this.  "You know, I've been studying Collins!" Or "Isn't this a new 3?"   But I couldn't think of anything that'll stick.  I was drawing my fourth tile when Rafi said "HOLD." I freeze and I'm sort of wondering what the heck he wants to challenge until I see my mistake.

#note Okay, here we go.  I took about 35 minutes on this turn.  I knew that i wanted to fish off two tiles - AR - to let Rafi empty the bag.  I also knew I had to open a bingo lane for myself that is hard to block.  I was also nervous about the unseen Q.  I found two fishes:  AR and (DE)AR.  I couldn't decide between the two.  The problem I had with AR was the B and K hooks and both letters are unseen.  The problem I had with DEAR is that I felt it was too easy to block.  Rafi must have the other blank and all he'll have to do is play 15H BAKEs or something.  He'll know better than to bingo through the R.  [Over-the-board, I saw OUTBREAK as a playable bingo].  His bingo will lose to me bingoing out.  BUT there's one thing I didn't consider:  If I play DEAR, it's possible that I can stick Rafi with the Q and WIN that way.  I played the sequence over-the-board and I win by a few points with Q-sticking and slow-playing.

#note Had Rafi played this in four seconds, I would have felt so bimboish.  But it actually took him about an hour or so.  It took him so long that I started to amuse myself with the idea that the blank is the last tile in the bag.  Unfortunately for me, this is Rafi's actual rack and the Q was the last tile in bag!  It's funny how we were both thinking the same thing at this point in the game: "I'll lose only if the Q's in the bag."

#note I was running low on time.  I think we both had less than 20 seconds on our clocks.

#note When we were sort of going over the game after it was over,  I told him I had NO idea what I was thinking when I played AAT.  I just got so obsessed with fishing off AW.  I told him I meant to play 7H WA instead.  
Rafi:  But WA isn't good either!
Me:  .........
