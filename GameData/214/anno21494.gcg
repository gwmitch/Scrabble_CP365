#note I remember seeing MYOPIA but I don't know why I passed it up. This is about 8 points down but I should be better than that. This was the last game of the day though

#note I was freaking out at this point. RELATEDLY hooks are the best plays, but DRYABLE is also an option, which I saw but wasn't sure of. I remember my logic being that I wanted to draw a G, but I didn't consider that Marty could have one. There are lots of better plays.

#note D8 PRINTED wins the most often at 43.75%. I have to keep in mind though that Marty has about 30 seconds left and could mess up. I was so fixated on keeping my N for row 12 though so I could have done a lot better here. I knew there was an N unseen (I had tracked correctly) and had to hope he fixated on GLAZY and wouldn't block row 12. A vowel draw gives me something almost every time. The only plays besides PRINTED that have win % are BARTEND or BANED at column C, and just PRINT. Specifying Marty's actual rack shows just BARTEND and BANED as wins, with 31.25 and 12.5 respectively. I'm at a loss though. I spent a while thinking about this, and I remember finishing this play with about 45 seconds.

#note So MOVING isn't actually on CP's list! GAMING is though. MOVING still wins though. Had he done GAMA like I wanted him too, BREEDING would have won by one before a recount or tied after it. Well played by Marty.

#note And I slap this down as 20. A great game, one of the best I had this whole tournament.
