#note This is a phony. I can easily point to this as why I did not make top 8, because if I challenge that off, he has those crappy letters on this board not fitting.

That morning going 0-4, I had to go 3-0 to make top 8. I won the 2 prior to this, and needed this game. Even had I reviewed my 6's, I may not have challenged to be honest. But it's still inexcusable.

#note Here I was trying to save my J for scoring next turn. Apparently I should have done it in reverse order. I considered FRORE as well but I needed to keep that E for sure.
