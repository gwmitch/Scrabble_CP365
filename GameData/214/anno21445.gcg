>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AHIO 8H OHIA +14 14
>Reid: BEIOTTW 7H WOT +20 20
#note WET is #1 (44.95%). BAWTIE at K7 is #2 (4.81%). My play is #3 (44.58%). I disagree with Quackle here but the difference is negligible. Not really a mistake here. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AINO 9J NAOI +10 24
>Reid: BEEISTV 10G VIBE +17 37
#note VIBE at 9E is #1 (56.08%). BET at 8M is #3 (54.45%). My play is #2 (55.36%).
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: GUV 8M GUV +24 48
>Reid: BDEELST 11J DEBT +20 57
#note DEB at 10L is #1 (55.24%). DEB is #2 (53.03%). My play is #3 (52.41%). Minor mistake here. TELS leave is stronger.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EIT 12K TIE +18 66
>Reid: AEHLSTW 6E WHAT +24 81
#note WEALTHS at 13F is #1 (71.75%). At G1 its #2 (70.31%). I considered playing #3 WHATS at 13J (62.02%) but didn't want to use my ess. This is a huge mistake and likely cost me the game. My play is #9 based on valuations of all plays.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AQST 13J QATS +40 106
>Reid: DEIJLST N6 JE. +26 107
#note JEW at E4 is #1 (45.81%). JEWS is #3 (42.87%). My play is #2 (43.63%). I agree with Quackle here, but this is not a big mistake. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EEEIPR E6 .EEPIER +24 130
>Reid: DEILLLS 5E SEL +39 146
#note DILLS or DELLS at 5A are #1 (43.51%) and #2 (43.2%). DRILL at 12D is #3 (41.51%). My play is #6 (40.99%). I wasn't sure using my ess here was worth it, but Quackle thinks I should take the points. I think Quackles top 2 are a little too volatile at this point. I'm okay with my play here. This is a minor mistake.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: DFOOR 8A ROOF.D +42 172
>Reid: CDDILLS B6 CL.D +13 159
#note #1 play.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: MOPT 12D T.OMP +24 196
>Reid: ?DILMNS 13G MI +20 179
#note Oh man, this is bad. RIMLANDS at A8 is #1 (70.04%). MEHNDI at F4 is #2 (46.85). My plays is #3 ( 46.84%).
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: XY H12 ..XY +48 244
>Reid: ?DLLNRS 11E .L +4 183
#note Exchanging DLNR or DLLNR are #1 (20.50%) and #2 (19.24%). RYND at 15G is #3 (19.22%). I considered RYND but didn't want to help block up the board. I agree with Quackle here, exchanging is probably the best play here. My play is #14 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: ANRU 15D UNAR. +9 253
#note Amnuay is just closing up the board now. 
>Reid: ?DLNORS 14D NOD +19 202
#note #1 play.
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EIINR O8 .INIER +10 263
#note More board closing. I need a bingo soon. 
>Reid: ?ALNRSU J13 .UA +14 216
#note I really wanted to keep my A here for the ALA hook. UNI at 10C is #1 (22.30%). SARI at 10B is #2 (22.23%). I don't like that play. It blocks up a potential bingo lane and uses the S. XU at 14H is #3 (21.97%). My play is #8 (18.75%). I agree w/ Quackle here, using both vowels was not good. I didn't end up mattering though. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: AFY 4F FAY +25 288
>Reid: ?CKLNRS H1 SKR. +33 249
#note #1 play. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: EZ 2F ZE. +36 324
#note This one hurt. Amnuay is able to block up board and score well. 
>Reid: ?CELNOS 15C L..... +9 258
#note OS at I1 is #1 (47.40%). LO at O5 is #2 (39.67%). SO at I4 is #3 (37.83%). I dont like OS because it blocks up a bingo lane. In hindsight, it's a great move. I also didn't want to use my only vowel. My play is invalid. I guess this turn was a big mistake. I like LO of the top choices. 
>Amnuay_Ploysangngam: ?AGINRU 1H .INGUlAR +77 401
>Reid: ?ACENOS A8 .OmANCES +83 341
#note #1 play. 
>Reid:  (EG) +6 347
#note This was a painful game to review. I missed two bingos and unintentionally played a phony. 9 of my 14 plays are in the top 3. 12 of 14 are in the top 10. Missing the bingos early allowed Amnuay to control board later. This was a winnable game. Overall, I give myself a D this game.
