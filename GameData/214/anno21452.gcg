#note I held this for a pretty long time, actually, as I worked out that RATTLERS did in fact have a partner.
>Will: AAEEFIL 12H FAE.A +24 100
#note FAENA or FILAREE? Or something else? I'll take the extra bingo% over the 9x chances that Matthew will rarely leave me.
>Matthew: IRZ H12 .RIZ +48 212
>Will: AACEILR D1 CERIA +22 122
#note Well, now things really do seem dire enough to make a play like this, but apparently I bingo 80% after ZA, so that's gotta be it.

#note Better than 10C OILY because he might have good J plays down there, and I just want him to play the real word. This just looks like I'm creating a lane.
