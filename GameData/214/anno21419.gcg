>Reid: AEEELQR 8A ALEE +22 30
#note #1 play. Didn't like keeping the Q but figured the exchange would hurt more. I took the points and hoped to use the Q better next turn.
>Wallace_Shultz: CDDEIOR 10G C.ODDIER +68 87
#note DIVORCED at F5 scores 73.
>Reid: EEEOQRT F7 .OE +6 36
#note Exchanging QOE, QOEE, or QOEET are top 3 (21.47%, 20.94%, 20.46%). Stuborrnly, I decided to try and tough it out. This would turn out ot be a very bad choice. My play is not in the top 15 of 5 min champ obviously. My play is #32 based on valuations of all plays.
>Wallace_Shultz: ?ADORTY L6 ADRO.TlY +74 161
#note DOTARDLY at K5 is 98. This rack has loads of bingos.

>Wallace_Shultz: AOV E10 AVO +24 250
>Reid: EFINNOS N6 INFE.NOS +71 230
#note My play is #2. SINFONIE at 4G is #1. This shouldn't be a big mistake but it would turn out to be. I would expose the triple in the lower right. SINFONIE may have blocked Wallace's last bingo. My bingo also gave Wallace a nice fat triple. 
>Wallace_Shultz: AM O8 AM +31 281
>Reid: GIISUUY F13 GUY +23 253
#note Quackle really hates this rack. Even more than I do. All but 1 of the top 15 plays are exchanges. GIUUY, GIIUUY, GIIUU are the top 3 (10.25%, 10.15%, 9.94%). My play is #13 (7.71%). I don't consider this a huge mistake, but it is a missed opportunity. There is still one blank out, so exchanging might have given me some momentum. 
>Wallace_Shultz: BD 9A B.D +20 301
#note This was incorrectly scored as 19.
>Reid: AAIISTU O11 AI +8 261
#note AUREI at D5 is #1 (11.01%). AI and AIT at M13 are #2 (10.98%) and #3 (10.47%). I like AUREI but didn't see it. AI and AIT increase volatility, but at this point they may be worth it. I agree with Quackle here. I was just trying to balance and block the triple in the lower left. My play is #9 (8.35%). 
>Wallace_Shultz: ?EGINST 4H ExIST.NG +72 373
#note GENITURES and STINGAREE at D1 score more, but Wallace's play is good enough. Since he already had the blank, exchanging on my last turn would not have been as fruitful anyway. I already had an ess. 
>Reid: AEIMSTU O1 IMA.E +24 285
#note DUE at K10 is #1 (1.57%). AMU and AMI at M13 are #2 (1.25%) and #3 (1.17%). My play is #7 (0.58%). I like DUE but dont agree with Quackle with the others. Using an E here is okay because there are still 3 out. Small mistake here, but the game is pretty much over. 
>Wallace_Shultz: OOZ H1 OOZ. +39 412
>Reid: CEHSTUW E5 WH. +18 303
#note WUZ at 3F, WUSS at K2, and HUIC at J2, UM at 2N, WHO at 2F, and WE at 11I are only plays with positive win percentage. My play is #5 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Wallace_Shultz: A 3H .A +14 426
>Reid: CEFSTUX N1 XU +35 338
#note FUCI at 1L, COFT at 2G and FUCOSE at 2E are top 3. My play is #8. I forgot to draw the last tile from the bag. 
>Wallace_Shultz: AEINPSU J2 SP.N +22 448
#note According to 5 min champ player. Wallace's play is not in the top 15. AUREI at D5 is the best place here. 
>Reid: CEFST 14B .F +10 348
#note REEF at D7 is #1. FEW at 5C is #2. FA at 10D is #3. I think Quackle is broken. It has my winning percentage as 100%. I think the tile in the bag has messed things up. My plays is #6. 
>Wallace_Shultz: AEEIU M13 EAU +18 466
#note Wallace misses his out here at J9 with ADIEU. He does not have two E in his rack. 
>Reid: CEST 15K SC.TE +30 378
#note #1 play. There is still an E in the bag.
>Reid:  (IE) +4 382
#note This game was officialy scored ast 465-380. It should have been scored as 466-380.
No missed bingos this game. 7 of of my 14 plays where in the top 2. 11 of 14 in the top 10. Not exchanging on my third turn is really the only possible mistake. Exchanging on turn 8 instead of playing GUY also may have made a difference if I could have pulled a blank. This is a game of what ifs. This game was possibly winnable. Overall, I give myself a B+.
