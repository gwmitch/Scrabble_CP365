>Joey_Krafchick: DEEIINS -EI +0 0
>Will_Anderson: CKOOSTU 8F COOK +20 20
#note W: In a vacuum 8H COOK setting up COOKOUTS is pretty good, but after x2 I wasn't sure what to do. It may still be right.
>Joey_Krafchick: DEINRSU J6 INSURED +73 73
>Will_Anderson: DEFSTTU 11I F.UD +16 36
#note W: K11 FEUD looks like warranted aggression. A number of modestly better options.
>Joey_Krafchick: BCGIQTY G7 B.GY +15 88
#note J: L11 (D)ICTY sims closely but this play is best
>Will_Anderson: EEINSTT 12C INSETTE. +75 111
>Joey_Krafchick: CEIPQST E10 QI. +24 112
>Will_Anderson: ADEEHIS 13H EH +24 135
#note W: Close with 13F HAED. It's an even game, going broke for bingos isn't necessary. Still, this is fine.
>Joey_Krafchick: CEEIPST 12L EPIC +28 140
#note J: 14I SPECIE is worth looking at....but this is better
>Will_Anderson: ?AADEIS 14C AcEDIAS +74 209
#note W: Saw SIDALCEA, didn't want to chance it.
>Joey_Krafchick: DEEIRST O5 DESERTI. +83 223
>Will_Anderson: AAAEILR N9 AAL.I +15 224
#note W: I preferred AALII to N1 REALIA, which looks like it gets me whacked really hard, but it's a tough call. The extra 8 points and two tile picks are nice, and sometimes Joey will have a play like the one he has and it'll work out better for me.
>Joey_Krafchick: AEGOXYZ 15A ZAX +66 289
>Will_Anderson: AAAERWW N5 AWA +32 256
>Joey_Krafchick: EGOOUVY M7 VUG +29 318
>Will_Anderson: ABEEIRW M1 WEBER +24 280
#note W: Trying to open in a way that will be tricky to close completely...it doesn't work.
>Joey_Krafchick: AEFLOOY L1 OFAY +47 365
>Will_Anderson: AILNOOU 8C OLI..... +15 295
>Joey_Krafchick: ELMNNOR 7C MEL +19 384
#note J: N1 EMO is 37 leaving LNNR. This play makes it really hard from him to open up again. Tough call but I think my decision is fine
>Will_Anderson: AHNORTU 1H OUTR.. +27 322
#note W: G12 THIN is exactly what I was looking for here - something that preserves OUTROWED/OUTTOWER/OUTPOWER triple-triple. I can also play 15E HANT for a great score and hope to redraw the T along with the other miraculous combos I need. I sort of gave up with my play...not good.
>Joey_Krafchick: ELNNOOR 2G LENO +14 398
#note J: I found it really hard to see a scenario where he bingoed (which is super unlikely ending in a vowel here, with no S's out especially) and then outran me in an endgame after this play.
>Will_Anderson: AHIJNPT 9A HAP +21 343
#note W: Trying to set up NIGHTJAR with the right draw, not that it will ever stay. K4 PHT looks good, but there's really nothing I can draw afterwards.
>Joey_Krafchick: NNORRTV A8 T.ORN +27 425
>Will_Anderson: ?GIJMNT K3 JaM +39 382
#note W: JIGs/AALIIs, then MINT 6J.
>Joey_Krafchick: NORV D4 NOV.. +16 441
#note J: H12 (TEA)R for 12 is 19 points better, apparently. I didn't think I had an endgame worth solving here, I just was glad to have a decent V spot!
>Will_Anderson: GINT 5A ING.T +12 394
