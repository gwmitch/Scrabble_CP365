#note Pool is almost 50% vowels, so DRT is a better leave than normal. I saw and rejected DIKTAT... I think I was worried about running out of lanes. I bingo 29% after ADIT vs. 20% after DIKTAT, but I'm also giving back more points to either Charles or Thomas. Quackle prefers DIKTAT.

#note Is it worth sacrificing 2 points to set up BROASTED and to avoid putting a vowel next to the double? Perhaps going for ZEIN or JEER or something is what I need.

#note OXEYE gives more back than OX, but I need to bingo quickly. The Reinke who I was playing took a long time on EMO so I felt like he had the blank... does that mean I should play OX instead? Or do I need to hope he drew poorly, that I bingo and then can shut down the lanes? The pool does contain JUUVWWZ so there definitely is a chance he drew some of that crap. The Y is really easy to fish on this board which is a plus, but my bingo chances are much higher after OXEYE than OX or VOX. Quackle likes OX or VOX better.

#note Saw JAKE, thought that at this stage in the game it was worth sacrificing points to increase my bingo chances. If I still think Charles has the blank, I'm not frequently going to win by outrunning so hitting a quick bingo is pretty important. With a blank inference, JURA bingos 41% and JAKE bingos 27%.

#note I don't think I can win this game without a bingo, especially if I still think Thomas (Charles?) has the blank. EVE leaves only 4 in the bag, so a Z play making NEVE will empty the bag and can't outrun a bingo. Based on the pool, I have a decent chance of drawing NUTSIER 8s through the E, and Charles (Thomas?) also has to address the NEVE lane. Another interesting optinon that I didn't consider is E(L), which gives me a 4/14 shot at UNIVERSE and also REVUIST as a double threat. If we trade bingos of equal score (Charles bingos through the E, I bingo out with REVUIST) then I might get enough points off Thomas's rack (ZW perhaps?) to win!
