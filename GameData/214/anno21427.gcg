>Reid: CGNNOQU H7 CON +10 10
#note COG and CONN at 8G are #1 (46.79%) and #2 (46.70%). Exchanging GNOQU is #3 (45.95%). I didn't like the opening rack but didn't think it that bad. I wanted to keep NG and the QU. My play is not in top 15 for 5 min champ palyer. It is #2 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Mady_Kamen: EIINRTU 7A NEURITI. +62 62
>Reid: GINPQUY A4 PUN.Y +39 49
#note QUIP at 10F is #1 (33.70%). Didn't even see it. GINNY and PINNY at A4 are #2 (32.55%) and #3 (32.4%). I didn't want to use the U and it turns out I didn't have to. My play is #10 (30.68%). This was a medium sized mistake. 
>Mady_Kamen: ALNOZ 10F ZONAL +42 104
>Reid: AGQRSTW G6 Q. +11 60
#note QAT and QATS at E9 are #1 (34.29%) and #2 (31.16%). QAT at 6E is #3 (29.98%). I didn't see the 6E play until after my turn and I was cursing to myself for missing it. I completely forgot about the ZONAL hook. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My plays is #45 based on valuations of all plays. This is a huge mistake. 
>Mady_Kamen: ACDL 11D CLAD +28 132
>Reid: AGRSTTW 11I WAT +19 79
#note GAT at 12F is #2 (21.48%). WAG at 11I is #3 (21.33%). TWIG at G5 because of the strong leave is #1 (24.83%). My play is #8 (20.36%). This is a small mistake that turns out not to matter. 
>Mady_Kamen: FJU E4 FUJ. +28 160
>Reid: EEGRRST C3 GEST.RER +70 149
#note My play is #2 (34.91%). REGRETS at L6 is #1 (37.43%). I saw REGRETS in my rack, not sure why I missed this play. 
>Mady_Kamen: BNOO -  +0 160
#note Maddy challenges GESTURER and loses. 
>Reid: EFIORSX B9 FOXIER +45 194
#note Aha. This is the reason for the loss. I miss the beautiful FOXFIRES at 4E (86.24%). My play is #2 based on valuations of all plays. 
>Mady_Kamen: BNOO A12 BOON +38 198
>Reid: AABHOST L9 BATH +25 219
#note ABO at 12I is #1 (57.32%). ALBA at E10 is #2 (56.42%). ABASH at 12I is #3 (55.70%). My play is not in top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #20 based on valuations of all plays. I agree with Quackle here. The leave is not very good. This is another mistake. 
>Mady_Kamen: ?EINRSV 13G RaVINES +88 286
#note VERSION at M8 and others score 90.
>Reid: AAEGOSY B2 GAY +25 244
#note GOY and GOA at 12F are #1 (17.08%) and #3 (15.47%). AGO at 12E is #2 (15.99%). I didn't even look down there. My play is #11 (12.22%). MIssing GOY is huge for the points and the block of the triple. Another big mistake. 
>Mady_Kamen: KMO H12 M.KO +36 322
>Reid: AEMOSTT M3 STOMATE +77 321
#note I saw OSTOMATE at 15H, #1 (43.42%). Couldn't recall if it was valid. My play is #2 (36.10%). Another 12 points missed. 
>Mady_Kamen: ADEI L4 IDEA +23 345
>Reid: ADDIPUW 14J DUD +30 351
#note CUPID at D11 is #1 (34.67%). WALI at E9 is #2 (30.83%). My play is #3 (29.00%). I like CUPID because it doesn't block up the bottom row.WALI is a bit of a puzzler. I decided to go for points even though I didn't want to keep my W.
>Mady_Kamen: EEV F2 VEE +19 364
>Reid: AAHILPW K3 WHA +32 383
#note WAAH at K3 is #1 (67.00%). ALPHA at K1 is #2 (62.43%). LIPA at K2 is #3 (55.92%). My play is #10 (40.83%). Not sure i agree with Quackle here. I like WAAH, but I forgot the new word. ALPHA seems unnecessarily volatile. Not sure why LIPA is so high ranked when keeping the W. There are 3 I out so keeping the I seems risky. I didn't think my play was that bad. 
>Mady_Kamen: E 6L ..E +7 371
>Reid: AIILLPR N2 PI +10 393
#note HI at 12L, VILLI at 2F and LIRI at N9 are all tied with several others based on win percentage (75%). I guess Quackle's belief is based on the remaining tile in the bag (it's an I). I just saw my opponent bingoing and no way to stop it. I knew NEURITICS was good, so I just tried making the triple more difficult and hoped she didn't have a bingo. My play is #25 based on valuations of all plays.  
>Mady_Kamen: ?EEGIOS O1 GEnOISE +86 457
>Mady_Kamen:  (AIILLR) +12 469
#note Initially, I thought the tiles lost me this game, but there was enough fumbling w/ the Q to disrupt early momentum. A bingo was missed and there were a couple of poor choices in the middle. There was no stopping Mady's out, but better play initially could have given me a stronger lead near the end. This was a winnable game. Only 7 of my 12 plays were in the top  10. Overall, I give myself a C-/D+ this game.
