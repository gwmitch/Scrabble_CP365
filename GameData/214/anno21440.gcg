>Joey_Krafchick: NOORTTY J6 TO.TY +18 18
#note J: New word here. Sims best
>Thomas_Reinke: ?ADLNRV H8 .VeRLAND +86 104
>Joey_Krafchick: INNOPRX K5 NIX +31 49
>Thomas_Reinke: AEEEOSW I12 AWEE +27 131
>Joey_Krafchick: ILNOPRY L3 IRONY +34 83
#note J: I wanted to keep the board really open here. ROPY or something similar boxes me in too much, asking for disaster. PYRONI(NE) I would have played if I saw. Doesn't sim quite as well, though.  
>Thomas_Reinke: EEIOOSU -EIOOU +0 131
>Joey_Krafchick: EEEGLPZ J12 PEG +29 112
#note J: I have ELEG(I)ZE for 36, but no need to be that volatile with a 29 point option leaving the Z 
>Thomas_Reinke: EENNSTU M3 NET +15 146
#note T: Sims best! Haters may kindly exit the room.
>Joey_Krafchick: EEIILOZ 10F ZE. +31 143
>Thomas_Reinke: EHNSSUU K11 USE +19 165
#note T: Sims best again! Every play sucks!
>Joey_Krafchick: AEEIILO 11C ILEA +19 162
>Thomas_Reinke: ADHKNSU 12A KUNA +32 197
#note 12C T: DAHS is 40, which is worth it on this board. This is second best according to Quackle, though if I had another chance I might do C9 HAIKU.
>Joey_Krafchick: DEGIOOO -DIOOO +0 162
#note J: I hate G's more than anyone, but with two IN spots I figure that if I can just draw the blank I probably can finagle a 9 next turn. I didn't like any of the options here especially, I have to win this game and nothing feels good here in terms of outscoring him by the end of this 
>Thomas_Reinke: ABDGHIS C8 HID..G +24 221
>Joey_Krafchick: BEGMRTV N4 VERB +21 183
#note J: Gotta get volatile now, unfortunately. Fasten your seatbelts.
>Thomas_Reinke: AABEFQS 9B Q. +11 232
#note T: I'm always eager to play a Q off as quickly as I can. This is not right at all, but hey, at least I got rid of that little bugger.
>Joey_Krafchick: AEGIMST D2 SIGMATE +78 261
#note J: Bailed out from GMT leave!
>Thomas_Reinke: AABEEFS A12 .EEF +33 265
>Joey_Krafchick: AHINOPU C2 OPAH +38 299
#note J: I figure that this puts me up enough with a solid chance of drawing the M myself, to where even if he hits the M play for 35 I still get the O7 spot to likely outrun him. 
>Thomas_Reinke: AAABIJS O1 JABS +50 315
>Joey_Krafchick: IINORRU 10A RI. +19 318
>Thomas_Reinke: AADIIRU O7 AI +10 325
#note T: No need for this. If he had the blank at this point, he would have done something else on his last turn. On the other hand, again, every option sucks. Exchanging looks good here.
>Joey_Krafchick: ILMNORU E3 NOM +39 357
#note J: Lucky
>Thomas_Reinke: ACDIRTU B1 ID +14 339
#note T: Gives me another lane to work with, if he doesn't have the blank yet he might have to sacrifice to block. 7A DUCT might be better, it doesn't absolutely commit me to bingoing, I missed the spot entirely.
>Joey_Krafchick: ILLOORU 1A L. +6 363
#note J: Apparently UDO takes an S, guys! I just saw the A hook and immediately played this. Embarassing. OUR is the play, by the way
>Thomas_Reinke: ?ACRTUW L9 CUTe +24 363
#note 3K WIN is loved by Quackle. Why? I don't see an available bingo after playing that, and it scores nothing. This scores more than nothing, but 7B ACT is way better, saving the blank and creating a hook for myself. Missed the spot again.
>Joey_Krafchick: ILOORSU 9L .OIR +10 373
#note J: Best solution
>Thomas_Reinke: ADEORW F1 AWE +20 383
#note T: M12 DREW or DRAW. Ran out of time.
>Joey_Krafchick: LOSU G3 SOUL +13 386
#note J: I played this just in case HIDINGS is phony somehow
>Joey_Krafchick:  (RDO) +8 394
