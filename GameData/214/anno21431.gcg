#note Tough call between JIBBA and NIQAB here. Q doesn't like my choice, but it's close. I think the Q is strong with the K8 spot available.

#note EQuINE for 80 gives up big counters, but it scores 80! I need to play that here.

#note This was sloppy on my part. I figured that holding AY?, I would be able to go out in one and win, even if she plays ZI(T)S. But I needed to go through and check each tile, and this play doesn't win if I draw the V because I can't go out in one. KA(T) wins 7.5/8 games here, but nothing wins 100%.

#note Overall I played fairly sloppily - not playing EQuINE was big, WANION took away bingos when I had a blank, and maybe I should have cashed in the bingo instead of playing dJIBBA.

So far my last three games have followed the same pattern: I get a big lead early, some stuff happens, I make a mistake and also get hosed by tiles, and then I lose. 
I need to be better.
