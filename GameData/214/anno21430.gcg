>Nigel_Peltier: III -III +0 0
>Matt_Canik: AAIMOPW H4 MIAOW +26 26
#note For the third straight night, I get almost no sleep and am so tired that I can't play MIAOW in the right spot
>Nigel_Peltier: AELRVV 5E REV.VAL +52 52
#note And that's what I get
>Matt_Canik: ADDNNPR J4 P.NDAN +11 37
#note Q says to play PAN(E)D and keep the more volatile DNR. My weakness this whole tournament has been playing an excessively risk-averse strategy
>Nigel_Peltier: BEES L2 BEES +26 78
>Matt_Canik: DEMORRS 10D DORMERS +76 113
>Nigel_Peltier: ?DEEORU 2G REDOU.lE +74 152
#note Neither of us knew this until after the game: REDOUBLER is acceptable!!!
>Matt_Canik: ABIILOT 1E BIOTA +32 145
#note Complete failure to see OBIT
>Nigel_Peltier: FFIY 2B IFFY +33 185
>Matt_Canik: ACHHILO 1A CHI +34 179
>Nigel_Peltier: AK D10 .AK +16 201
>Matt_Canik: AAHILOO E8 AL.HA +32 211
#note Q slightly prefers (O)HIA in the same spot
>Nigel_Peltier: AGINT H10 .ATING +24 225
>Matt_Canik: EEINOOZ 6B ZONE +35 246
#note Q thinks the setup is far too cute and I should just play OZO(N)E despite opening the TWS. Numbers are probably skewed slightly by REDOUBLER plays
>Nigel_Peltier: ATX 7A TAX +46 271
>Matt_Canik: DEGIOSU 8A EGO +41 287
>Nigel_Peltier: EIIQRRU 14G I.QUIRER +88 359
>Matt_Canik: DIPSSUU 13A PUDS +23 310
#note I feel like PUDUS/INQUIRERS is close to an insta-lose play. I guess I could draw -IN(G) bingos or S- bingos in the REDOUBLES spot, but clearly my best line now is O8 and I want to keep it open. I want to hold the I for -ING and I need to hold at least one S. The play is UPS 3A, I think.
>Nigel_Peltier: ETY 13M YET +24 383
>Matt_Canik: EILNSUW D2 .LU +12 322
#note Seems like the best plays here reach as deep into the bag as I can without playing off 5 tiles or blocking one of the best lines (15 or O). 
>Nigel_Peltier: GJ B12 J.G +22 405
>Matt_Canik: CEINOSW M12 W.. +9 331
#note I've mistracked here and have a Y unseen instead of the blank, so I think there's a 2/8 chance I can pull into ESCOTIN(G) or SECTION O2 and win the game!
