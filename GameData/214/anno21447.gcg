#note VEG(A) scores the least but definitely has the best leave, this along with VE(G)GIE and PEG for 21 and 20 respectively are all very close but the other two are better marginally.
>Gwen_Stewart: EKN 6B KNE. +18 60

#note PITHI(N)G which I didn't know stands out, also pieing, hieing, and tieing, all words that I kinda know but wouldn't have played.

#note Static doesn't like this play compared to FAX or RAX but the sim does.  The board isn't too friendly and I like keeping 2:2 with the X rather than 3:2

#note I figured on this board the S was worth it's usual 8 points and I couldn't see anything over 16 so I played this but it's losing to most of the fishing plays.  I don't really agree with quackle here. LA(THING) C1 definitely would've been the better play, but I like this more than all the other fishes.

>Sam_Masling: ADEELUY 11B YU.E +14 125
#note I like this a bit more than YEA or YE C9 because of its defensiveness compared to those plays and Q agrees but the 9 points are a lot so I'm not sure.

#note with 25/53 letters left being vowels and two blanks out, I thought this play was fine but it's not simming great.  DEADM(A)N and LEADM(A)N 2x2 are the way to go here, (obviously didn't see them)

#note I couldn't see anything else and I had no idea what blawn meant.  After the game she told me that if I hadn't done this, she was going to try it too.

#note no spot for quilted :(

I should have started thinking about the pre-endgame this turn but I just took the points i saw and wanted to block that spot for the B.

>Gwen_Stewart: CNO J6 CON +22 303
>Sam_Masling: ?BEIILQ 2L BILE +22 309
#note BILE 13F is the only win here, but with my play she has to find (REV)ErSOS to win, which few but Nigel would find.  Playing QIs and INWARDs gives her SU(Q)S which outruns me, but by playing this first and setting up QIs in three spots it gives me the win unless she finds reversos.
