#note I thought at the time this was a major lapse and that O1 AYE/EYE were way better, but it's not necessarily because EASY yields more bingos. Apparently, EASY actually yields fewer bingos than AYE/EYE because it blocks the D (and A, I guess) of ADVERTS as well as a handful of bingos from L7 with O in second position and only gives up the E in return. 4L EAVE is also worth some thought, though giving up the sevens lane after FA seems like a bad idea. Not a huge mistake, think I just got burned.

#note Not perfect with no I in hand, but could also become an S hook with CONE plays. H11 ASCON/RECON/OCEANS also look like variations on a decent approach.

#note CAVA still bingoes enough that the extra points appear to be worth it. Would be nice if there were more through the P than PARECISM/PICRATES etc., but SCONE is hard to block and NNNTTZ? play there.
