#note He laid down PILULAE* first and changed it to this. PECULIA plays
>Avery: EGIKRRZ C10 ..RK +22 261
#note Knowing he has an A, B5 ZIG can't be an option. I had to hope he would play from B1 and give me a decent comeback

#note Figured I'd go for SCRIVING. But knowing CHIVYING would have helped! Otherwise, this is touch since F6 is so dangerous but playing there just gives him an easy block. No way back into this unless I play CHIVYING

#note I just laid this down hastily. Great to play Jerry again though - he deserved this after I beat him by 1 in Vegas!
