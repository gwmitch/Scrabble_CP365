#note I spent a looooooong time on this play. Really frustrating that I couldn't find anything better defensively than this. The sim loves it, but I'm not convinced at all.

#note Not very good, but I was leery of time trouble and wanted to slap something down. Only 7/41 to hit a bingo that plays on this board... CALORIE or CELOSIA. I missed CIAO 12H, which scores and balances nicely.

#note Sims best, well ahead of the static leader KOI M3. Leaves line 4 open, and gives me more chances for eights in the rightmost columns... a -LIKE word perhaps?

#note Or VEILLIKE or VITELLIN, neither of which I was 8 million percent sure of. Not sure what difference it makes.

#note This appears to be best... keeping the F and Z is nice since there's multiple spots to score with them.

#note But he blocks both spots! Excellent play... game over.
