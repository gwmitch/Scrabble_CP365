#note No good options, and I had no idea what to do.  The best scoring option is TOW 9H.  In the absence of having any idea what to do, I figured I'd just unload the least bingo prone of the tiles, which was the W.   Q says 9H TUI 11 is best.
>Mike_Early: ACLT 11E TALC +21 35
>Jim_Burlant: DIRSTTU 12C DUIT +14 23
#note I was fixated on front-hooking CUM with a bingo ending in S and wasn't looking hard enough for best play.  This is runner-up in the 2-ply sim, winning 1.5% less often than DUITS, and it sims roughly 3-1/2 points down.  DUITS was best, but this may have come out in the wash if I didn't draw another S by turning the extra tile.
>Mike_Early: EEGINNS F2 ENGINES +70 105
>Jim_Burlant: BRRSTTX 5D BR.TT +14 37
#note Q prefers BRUX H6; 22 - I saw this and felt I had to clear as much of this rack out as possible.  15% to win.
>Mike_Early: EOO D4 O.OE +12 117
>Jim_Burlant: AILQRSX C9 QAI.S +50 87
#note Best.  Of note:  J6 QIS 41, H11 CALIX 45.  The one question:  would I have gotten 50 for the Q had I played DUITS a few turns ago?Back up to 26%.
>Mike_Early: AJW C2 JAW +31 148
>Jim_Burlant: LORRRUX H11 .RUOR +24 111
#note Was about to exchange, then I saw this. This is probably the best play I made this game: it maximizes score, and it does a terrific job clearing the crap out of this utterly dreadful rack.  Q agrees - it's best.
>Mike_Early: ?ADEOSS 4H AlDOSES +69 217
#note Plays at J2 for 72, and 15H ROADLESS scores 74.,
>Jim_Burlant: EILNPRX H1 EXP.. +42 153
#note Takes not quite 100 iterations to percolate to the top, but this is best. 9% to win.  
>Mike_Early: ABEGL M2 GL.BAE +20 237
>Jim_Burlant: ?EILNPR L6 PRaLINE +72 225
#note I couldn't believe that I was actually back in this game, as much as I'd struggled in the early game.  As for this choice, Q confirms that there is nothing on rows 14 or 15.  This is a solid choice, but it's not best.  I missed PURLINES 13G, which scores 76 and wins 28-1/2%.  This wins 26-1/2 in a short sim. 
>Mike_Early: GHNT 14F TH.NG +15 252
>Jim_Burlant: DEFNORY B10 YO +28 253
#note Way too paranoid about the unseen Z to look anywhere else.  The sim says either this or N4 SOY are best, and 2J FORGED is also in the mix.  I whiffed on FORGED.  I considered and rejected SOY because, while it scored well, it lt didn't defend against a potential game-clinching ZA B10.  45% to win.
>Mike_Early: ADEHN 2J HAN.ED +38 290
>Jim_Burlant: ADEFNOR A8 FOR +24 277
#note Q doesn't like this at all, saying that I should simply fish with 5J OF and try to draw into a bingo ending in ER down the A column.  OF wins 39%; this wins 30.  Given that I drew AEI on my replenish, it may not have mattered.
>Mike_Early: FIK K10 KIF +35 325
>Jim_Burlant: AADEEIN 1N AE +17 294
#note Or N4 SADI.  14.5% to win.
>Mike_Early: AEM N4 .AME +32 357
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINVZ O7 DEVA +29 323
#note Getting too cute for my own good, trying to set up ZIN and gambling that he didn't have a block. One thing that doesn't show up in the annotation is that, once again, Mike's warp speed play was factoring in.  I was under 1 minute while he was at 17.  What I didn't know is that the bag contained ILOY, which sealed my fate.  While I probably got this turn wrong, during post-mortem analysis Mike and I figured out that, no matter what I put down (even if I played DAZE or DIZEN), I was dead.  Champ says I should have just played ZA/(FE)Z for 37, which wins 36%.
>Mike_Early: EIILTUV N10 TUI +9 366
>Jim_Burlant: IILNOYZ J4 .OZY +37 360
#note Best is ZOO 6B to block his out.  Maybe I'd have seen that if I'd managed my time better.
