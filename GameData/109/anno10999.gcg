#note -3 -bv. i did consider it and binged. vibe, dev, binged, are all similar, even GIVEN. VIG isn't quite as good because i'm limiting my rack too much too, i think.

#note wow, i have seriously already lost this game. stupid Q. i don't know what to do here! quackle actually likes 5I QI significantly more... it is more defensive while at the same time giving me a slightly higher score next turn? i think this is only because quackle is assuming that the opponent will make some board-opening play with his next play because of the static evaluator though. maybe i should just exchange. (-3)

#note or baned, but i wanted it to be slightly more open? i hate this board i hate this board. i hate having to sacrifice a leave like this. (-1.5)

#note don't close up on me oh boardy. what about something like UMBRA? BURG is also cool but it scores too little and it's gross. why does quackle love it so much. (-0.5)

#note cogged is much better (noah) he chickeend :( out
>cesar: ELNRSUX B5 XERUS +28 112
#note lex is clearly better, stop getting frustrated (-5.5) this is a total game-losing overreaction. oh well. LOX 2I is also cool opening a scoring spot that hopefully he won't take, and keeping the bingo lane open.

#note i should probably not open the board like this after he makes a one-tile play and i have no chance to win.  quackle is giving some small win % to 11G UPLIT in a contrived sequence that always results in noah opening a triple-triple and me getting it... right.

#note i basically lost this game on the 3rd turn (after aerobia) after the board unluckily became very uncomfortable, and i was poor at opening it (XERUS). must keep learning!
