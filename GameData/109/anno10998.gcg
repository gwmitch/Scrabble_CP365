#note Quackle gives slight preference to 5C BAN, but I'd rather take the points.

#note A nice find with unpromising tiles

#note At least I didn't play OVERBIND*. I'm not sure how I missed CODRIVEN, which is clearly best. I think I somehow didn't consider the C at all. I did see OVERKIND, but it seemed too risky for the three extra points. Missed RINGDOVE too.

#note A tough call between this and TIREDEST. Turns out TIREDEST sims better.

#note Best play. THULIAS is almost as good
>New_Player_2: ADNOTTY F6 Y..D +33 284
#note G5 TOYED is best. Incidentally, Quackle sims only 2% win for me after YELD. Seems extreme, since I'm only behind one bingo, and both blanks are unseen.

>New_Player_2: AINOOTT 11A .OTATION +79 363
#note A lucky fit! Even after this, Quackle gives me only a 26% win. I felt more optimistic than that. There are still two blanks out there!

#note I had a feeling this bingo (my 4th!) would lose the game (either via a huge Q play, or a Q-stick on me), but I couldn't think of a better idea. Quackle thought of many better ideas; best is H10 ANIMES, which gives 62% win. MIDLINES wins maybe 25% of the time.
