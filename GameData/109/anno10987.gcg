>Rafi_: AEEGLPS 8H PELAGES +74 74
#note Not sure if this is the best placement, but I like my chances of killing the top left corner of the board after some overlapping plays. I may give up a few points early, but later on this placement could really pay off.
>Chris_Cree: BEJU 7G JUBE +37 37
>Rafi_: AEIOORY L8 .OOEY +18 92
#note It looks like GOOEY vs. OY. OY definitely does a great job at helping to kill the top left, but the leave is dreadful, and after an OY hook or UPON the board can open again. I can't play too defensively yet.
>Chris_Cree: HOW K10 WHO +38 75
>Rafi_: AIOPRRT M1 PRIORAT. +72 164
#note Scores 2 fewer, slightly safer than AIRPORTS.

#note Looks like this could be my game!
>Chris_Cree: OY 2J YO +31 158
>Rafi_: DLRTTUZ H1 LU.T +15 287
#note DRTZ gives me a shot at ADZ or DITZ for a bundle, and DAZE or ZA as other 30+ point plays in different spots.
>Chris_Cree: EIMT O12 TIME +34 192
>Rafi_: DEQRSTZ 5E ZEDS +33 320
#note The X is still out, but it probably would have come down last turn if he had it. I liked killing bingo chances here, and I have Q(A)T next turn if I don't draw something better. I think a 128 point lead on this board is pretty safe.

#note DEFENSE! (woot woot) DEFENSE! (woot woot)
