#note UNHAIR is a little better. Nice and open, which is good.

#note I thought it was time to get a tiny bit desperate, opening a triple-triple in a beneficial spot for me (SC- words are possible). Sim prefers MUSIC J6, which sets up a safer bingo line. Interesting choice -- it's really unlikely to backfire unless Alyssa has an S.

#note Poo. That's what I think of drawing OOO on a three-tile draw. Sim likes OOT C3 a little better, but this one captured my emotional state better. (Also, minor detail, I missed OOT.)

#note Or ARSONIST, but I figured the volatility of dangling the S out there might help. Maybe she pulled something terrible on the four-tile draw and has to trade? I dunno.

#note This sims better than the plays on the bottom half of the board that gum up lines for eights... no thanks, SEIZE, UPSIZE, etc.

#note I got a little obsessed with unloading the U here. YEH 3A scores a ton more than my play... probably worth it. It's worth noting that I could win this game by outrunning... but I'd probably need to draw the X and J and score well with both.
>Alyssa_Faria: JO F13 JO. +25 360
>Evans_Clinchy: EIILNOR A12 EL.I +24 324
#note FILO J1 sims better... interesting. My thinking was "I need to score more than 14 to make sure bingoing is enough to win even if she has a giant X play." I should have thought "maybe I can just block the giant X play."
