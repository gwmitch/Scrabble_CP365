>Stefan_Rau: AILOOUW -AILOOUW +0 0
#note This is surprising.....Quackle likes keeping AL, and keeping AIL, L, A, or IL all sim very close to tossing all seven. Really? As a general rule, I *hate* changing seven, but this seems like a slam-dunk time to do it. 
>Trey_Wright: ACKOR 8D CROAK +28 28
>Stefan_Rau: DEEGNRT 9E ENG +15 15
#note There are no eights at all in this promising-looking rack, not even in the silly book. I don't like blocking things up like this, but options are slim. Maybe (CROAK)ED? For what it's worth, ENG wins the sim by a narrow margin over stuff like G(O), (A)G, and other goofiness.  
>Trey_Wright: AAEELOZ F6 ZO..AL +37 65
#note I think this was the rack Trey said he had in our postmortem....he may have had two L's instead of two E's. Either way, ZOONAL looks best. 
>Stefan_Rau: DEEERTW 11D WE.TERED +98 113
#note It's been a while since I've seen ZOONAL, so I held it for a second before coming to the realization of "Who cares if it's good, there's your L, dummy!"

>Trey_Wright: DLOT A1 DOLT +26 210
>Stefan_Rau: BCIIJPT J7 JIB +16 237
#note C4 PIC comes out a little ahead on the sim, presumably on the strength of setting up a 41-point JIB. I didn't see it, but I think I prefer JIB here anyway. This seems like a good time to play it a little tighter. 
>Trey_Wright: ADENRUV -AEUDNR +0 210
>Stefan_Rau: CHIPSTU 7F .H +20 257
#note Lazy. I don't know if there was any thought process here beyond "Play something that doesn't open anything up." While my move does indeed fit that bill, C3 STICH for 46 would have been an actually good move.

#note Unjustly rewarded for my doofiness.

#note Good lord, I'm lucky that Trey's drawing like shit.

#note Poor equity play, but at this point I'm not really thinking much beyond bingo-prevention.
