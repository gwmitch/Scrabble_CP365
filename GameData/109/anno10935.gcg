>Jim_Burlant: EGLRTUY 8F UGLY +16 16
#note Sim says that it's stylistic preference as to whether to play this or 8H GLUEY.  Had I seen GLUEY I'd have probably put that down, but that's a word I know is good but rarely find.
>Fran_Silver: AV F6 VA. +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: EEIIRRT 6D RI.E +7 23
#note If you don't know the 8 that EEIIRRT makes through the V, your options absolutely suck.   6A TIRRIVEE is the best play.  As for this insteead of VIER:  I felt it was too early to get into a closed-board slog.
>Fran_Silver: AENOUZ H4 ZONU.AE +34 48
#note Very nice play.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIRST D2 DEST.IER +70 93
#note Trying to draw the challenge, as Fran is not a word studier.  Against my other opponents, I put down REEDITS C3 80.
>Fran_Silver: AEEHNOS -  +0 48
#note And the plan worked - Fran lost her turn challenging DESTRIER.
>Jim_Burlant: AHMOPQT 5B MO.H +28 121
#note Didn't feel it was time to unload the Q just yet.  This choice is a little risky as she could possibly hit something like CREAMY, BEAMY, etc.  A better alternative with these letters is MHO C7.  That said, Q just wants me to dump the Q for 21.
>Fran_Silver: ALNO 4H .ONAL +28 76
>Jim_Burlant: AIINPQT 2A QAI. +28 149
#note Really Quackle?  QADI?  Be serious!  Yes, I  have the P, but - call me crazy - I also think it's a little too risky to put the I at E2 with AAAABBHLLMPSSSTTTX still unseen.  Q says that QADI wins 79% and that this wins just under 76.5.  Pffft.
>Fran_Silver: DIW 8A WID. +24 100
>Jim_Burlant: AINOPRT C8 .OPANT +23 172
#note Then again, I'd be bingoing this turn if I'd taken the chance on QADI.  No bingos play, and I really had no idea what to do except turn some tiles and try again.  Q likes G1 OPIATE and 7B POI.  This isn't one of the original chioces but it sims as a top-5 choice.
>Fran_Silver: DV 3C D.V +20 120
>Jim_Burlant: CIJRSTY I3 J.Y +26 198
#note I briefly considered 12A JINS and rejected it - keeps too much crap and it's certain she'll be able to extend the J for at least 33.  Also considered K3 JAY and felt that my CIRST leave was close enough to a bingo that I wanted to keep things more open.  Q agrees - this is best, and it wins 88%.
>Fran_Silver: ?PRSSTU 12A PU.STeRS +76 196
#note Nice find by Fran.  Quackle likes 14A UPSTIRS a little better; I wish she'd found that one, as this really changed the complexion of the game.
>Jim_Burlant: CEIIRST A12 .ICE +24 222
#note Blocking my planned bingo of INCITERS.  Statically, Q just likes fishing off an I with QI for 11.  At the time, with 7 E's unseen, I figured it wasn't a big deal to unload my E, so I went with this, the sim winner. Q agrees - it's best.
>Fran_Silver: IX 5K XI +38 234
>Jim_Burlant: BGINRST 5G B.. +12 234
#note This eventually percolates to the top of the 2-ply sim - it's best.  Next best is B7 BIT, which wins 3% less often and sims nearly 6 points down on this.
>Fran_Silver: AEFLT 6J FETAL +31 265
>Jim_Burlant: AGINRST 14C STARING +70 304
#note Best bingo (the other option is STARLING N2 68), and I'm 67% to win in a short sim.
>Fran_Silver: EGLU 7K LUG +26 291
>Jim_Burlant: EMNNOOW 15G NOO +20 324
#note Bad miss - MENO 15E scores 32.  This is as good as anything else that isn't MENO, but MENO should have been the play.
>Fran_Silver: FO J2 FO. +23 314
>Jim_Burlant: BEKMNOW N1 EMBOW. +26 350
>Jim_Burlant: BEKMNOW --  -26 324
#note Saw this as a rack cleaner in a moment of inspiration, then Fran challenged.  As we walked to the adjudicator, I realized I was confusing EMBOWL* with EMBOWEL.  Q likes a bunch of 13I plays  (ENWOMB, EMBOW) that don't look so appealing if we assume the blank is in Fran's rack. Then again, any of those choices are better than pissing away 37% winning chances with an ill-timed brain fart.
>Fran_Silver: E 9H .E +9 323
>Jim_Burlant: BEKMNOW I13 E.. +5 329
#note To hell with equity, I say.  I figured Fran was a duplicated (triplicated?) E away from a bingo with the blank, and I wanted to make it more difficult for her to bingo. The points could wait.
>Fran_Silver: EH 4A EH +13 336
>Jim_Burlant: BKMNOW 10F KN.W +30 359
#note Didn't write this rack down and I don't know what the 7th tile was.  I wanted to kill 8's on row 10.  Now, if her bingo doesn't start in S, it doesn't play and she's going to have a very hard time scoring enough to catch up to me.  Against a random rack, this sims at 49%; EMBOW still wins the sim at 50%.
>Fran_Silver: DER J11 RED +7 343
#note Running low on time, Fran was stumped as to what to do.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABIMOT 6A OM +26 385
#note Best is apparently F2 BAM, but this gets the job done; Fran cannot go out on this turn and I have outs on opposite ends of the board (TIBiA(L) N1, and (R)eBAIT 11J.
>Fran_Silver: ACEEIR N1 CEREA. +16 359
#note Better is FIERCE 2J 22.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABIT 11J .eBAIT +14 399
>Jim_Burlant:  (I) +2 401
