>cesar: EEEEIIP G8 .EEPIE +13 13
#note maybe not too bad (-2) to EPEE. What do you guys think? I feel like WEEPIE could be too volatile, but WOW does not necessarily imply a strong rack.

#note seems like the rightest thing here.. does anyone like pilea?

#note Noah: you're saccing so much not to do kea so you should just do it against jerry. maybe not against rafi or dave wiegand but against jerry yes? what against dw? well he plays pretty open so it seems more reasonable against him, say (slunk?) GUNK   cesar: yeah KEA looks best.
>jerry: AQT C7 QAT +30 127
>cesar: AGLNSUZ 13C A.Z +26 172
#note Noah: Now SLUNG is better because you don't have to sac as much and he just closed the left quadrant too!! sillyzar    Cesar: critical mistake here! he's just blocked the entire left half of the board, and ZA is a great scoring leave! Even Quackle agrees with SLUNG, but I finally understand why! Teach ratingzar.

>cesar: EIRSUYY 4E .YRY +14 229
#note D2! Ok this is just a serious board vision mistake. i think 4E EYRY also sucks because putting a Y near a scoring spot allows dumping bad letters too often. i did think about 3D YaY though, which is also much better than my move. (-17)

#note i challenged dore. only way to win if it's not good, and for some reason i thought it could be phony (probably because dores* isn't a word). 
>jerry: BIO K4 BIO +19 418
#note i think my biggest mistake here was not playing SLUNG. if i play that, i have nearly full control of the board while up by ~50. couple that with the ugly EYRY placement that allowed him to dump FU easily, and it would have been a different game.
