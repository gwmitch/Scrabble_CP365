#note oh my god! it's not at all the right play, but a beautiful 9 goes down here.
>Jeremy_Frank: AEN 12K ANE +17 43
#note the play was bABOONISH!
>Magrathean: AEESTTU 10M TAU +12 110
#note way too paranoid and not even effective. no inferences makes UTE come out on top, whereas inferring an S makes ASTUTE and SAUTE rise to the top and makes TAU and UTE even. It seems like the midpoint between the two is him having a 50% chance of having an S. I think from inference that the odds are lower than that, so I say UTE is the play.

#note mrow. BRIE in the same spot does the same thing and clearly leads to fewer disaster racks. BITER at 9F wins the sim by a couple though. I guess his rack probably isn't quite so good any more, but I think I like BRIE because all the lanes that it leaves give me good comebacks if he bingos. BITER strikes me as a lot more volatile, and quackle agrees.
>Jeremy_Frank: ANW 13L NAW +23 90
#note astoundingly, during his move I drop one of the tiles I've drawn. it flips over and reveals a blank. he miscounted this as 19.
>Magrathean: ?EEIIST K1 pIETIES +70 196
#note yet another great nine was available here!

#note I'm sure you all saw kIESERITE.
>Magrathean: ELMOSTW 1N WO +29 225
#note what else?
>Jeremy_Frank: AAGGITU 9E GUITA. +18 168
#note jeremy's last two tiles were AG, he told me afterwards. nice play.

>Magrathean: ADEHIMU 2B HUMIDE. +34 319
#note yikes! I definitely wondered if this was actually a word or not but thought I remembered HUMIDEST being good. ugh. bag is consonant heavy so either spot for HUMIDER* is about even.

#note the X can wait
>Jeremy_Frank: ELNV 1A VEN.L +33 237
>Magrathean: EFGORXZ F8 F.ZE +36 395
#note not a great play at all. better are FIZ and OX, FIZ because the Z seems to be the clunkier tile on this board, but OX wins out because it plays at a more active part of the board while leaving FIZ or FUZE to be cashed in.
>Jeremy_Frank: AFSV O7 FAV.S +43 280
>Magrathean: DGOPRXY 11B GROP. +16 411
#note I didn't have too much time to figure this one out, so I'm proud to have actually figured out the best endgame for once! this blocks his big plays and gives me an out-in-two, slightly better than just cashing in DEXY right away and allowing him to play COINED. also good because it makes him have to do the hard work rather than me.
>Jeremy_Frank: CDEINOT 12A COED +31 311
#note jeremy should make some kind of blocking play instead of taking the points. I saw ODIC over the board, and it looks like that ends up being best.
