>Phil: ACEQRRS H11 RACER +33 216
#note Interesting. Q's top choice after simming is QI 6D. If I knew that ACERRS bingoes with 17 different letters, then I probably would have played it. Exch. QR is in second. RACER is in third. Exchanging down 101 while leavng an enormous hot spot open just seems retarded. Why not take 33, keep QS, and draw into a healthy bag (with 6 i's). Btw, what does it mean if RACER has the highest valuation for lowest win % of the three?

#note Missed ZORI for 41 at 6B! PRO sims second, setting up ZOONS or SOZINS if I draw an I.
>Jeremy_Hall: NOT O5 T.ON +12 326
>Phil: EEGNOSZ 14F ZE. +32 296
#note Wow, I just assumed ZEE had to be the best play. Didn't even consider ZEES at K8 for 48, but in hind sight, it looks best. I guess I looked at the score and thought that I needed a bingo to win when 48 points would have only put me down 14.

>Phil: DEEGNOS B4 GED +22 318
#note GONE in the same spot sims better- why? DE 6B is nice b/c there's only one unseen O besides mine.

#note Desperation attempt.
>Jeremy_Hall: AIV 15D VIA +21 389
>Phil: CEINOPS N1 .OP +16 334
#note I like SOP because it bingos 10% more often than either SPEC N1 or CANAPE 12G and I need a bingo at this point.
>Jeremy_Hall: EELNORU B8 FOULERS +79 468
>Jeremy_Hall: EELNORU --  -79 389
#note Insta-challenge. I remember looking this rack up and seeing no FOULERS*; only bingo is OURSELF!

#note Challenge
>Phil: EN L7 EN +12 428
#note Wow- played terribly. This has not been my best playing, but at least I improved to 2-2.
