#note I was hoping I might draw a challenge with this.  Stefan didn't even say hold.  He knows his words.

#note This is pretty far down kibitzer's list, but I like it much more than the other choices, for not only shedding the Q but also blocking several bingo lines at once.

#note Stefan has done a good job of keeping it close, but after his trade and this play, I thought I was in great shape to win.  What happened in the rest of the game was almost unfathomable.

#note This was a tough call.  I can score more with JIG or dump an extra consonant with WINGS or GIFTS at K9, but in none of these cases am I likely to bingo soon.  Given my lead, it seemed totally reasonable to take out the most likely spot for him to bingo.  As Marlon might say, bingoing from A1 or B1 requires more specificity, which favors the player with the blank.
>Stefan: AFO 11I OAF +26 355
#note Making me wish I had played on the K column, but I still look like I'm in good shape.

#note It's really easy to second guess myself on this play after what happens next, but my move is a clear favorite in the sim.  Quackle thinks I win over 90% of the time.  I thought about FINE B11, which doesn't score much more than this, but takes out the potentially good scoring spot for him.  However, with leave of ?GTU, I'm not in particularly good shape to bingo nor to score well on the next turn.  My play may give me bingos on column A or B, but it's also a versatile enough rack that if I pull one or two scoring tiles I will probably have good plays at 8A-8E or B10-B14.  I will gladly burn the blank on the next play if I can score enough to outrun him.  I did not see the play GUNITE B9, which in retrospect I really like.  It probably gives less of a chance for things to go wrong.  Nonetheless, it took an extreme swing of luck for everything to fall apart after this turn.
>Stefan: AW 2B WA. +33 388
#note It's hard to imagine this working out worse than it did.  His high scoring play blocked all my bingo lines, and my OOU draw leaves me no way to score on this board.  In one turn, Quackle thinks I've gone from a 90%+ favorite to about a 50% chance to win, and I think that may be too high.  I have some UN- or EN- bingo possibilities at C4, but I'd like to be able to score enough that I'm not reliant on a really lucky draw to win.
>Dave: ?ENOOTU E10 U.E +15 399
#note I was running low on time here, and maybe I could have done something else that would have given me a better chance.  But even now this seems like a reasonable choice.  Maybe I should play from 14A to take the B column spot out, but he could still hit a play from 8A.  Meanwhile, I'm scoring the most points that I can by making the KITHE hook and leaving one in the bag.  With more time to think about it, I like the play TOO C12, which takes out the B column spot while leaving optimal chances for an UN bingo from C4 and also holding the tiles for UNsET O11.
>Stefan: CEMR B10 CR.ME +38 426
#note Ugh.  Not only does he take a good lead with this play, but he has two spots for VISA, guaranteeing him the win.
