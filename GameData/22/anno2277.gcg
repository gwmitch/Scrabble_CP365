#note 10G (G)EOmETER wins... somewhat safer than hanging an S out into a triple lane.  10F O(G)EE gets high marks too keeping RET? and goes for more points next turn.  Really it's a greedy gambling play.
>Matthew: BILUY 1G BU.ILY +42 118
>Jeremy: ADEIOST 4E ASTE.OID +70 190
#note I sacrifice 2 points not playing IODATES or TOADIES at B2, and play ASTEROID away from the TWS. But Quackle still likes them better.

#note GTSOTB!
