#note How irksome! Annoyed that he'd blocked my bingo, I fail to recognize that SMOKIER still plays. This is one of the dumbest moves I made in the entire tournament. If I'm gonna miss the bingo, I could have at least played KEIR H12.

#note Astonishing. We were both thinking "KIRIGAMI" instead of thinking "KIRI is not a word." Experts.
>Joel_W: GNO 5J .ONG +24 144
#note If he'd challenged, I could have bingoed through the G with SIGNIORI!
>Carl: AIINOOS -OOI +0 176
#note Wrong, wrong wrong. OBA 12D wins the sim handily.

#note It's good in SOWPODS.
>Carl: ?ADGLSV 11D V.D +14 303
#note When I first simmed this game back in August, I put an E in place of the G, and cursed myself for not bingoing. On this second pass, I clearly had a G instead of an E. Whew!

#note GAS in the same spot is better because nothing plays parallel to it. The sim winner, curiously enough, is SAG 8M. I fail to understand this.

>Carl: ?ADILQS O11 SQuAD +79 394
#note Dumb. If I knew last game that WILY 32 ERS? was better than WRINKLES 74, then why don't I know that QADIS L? 52 is better than SQuAD 79 AL? It's amazing what you forget depending on the situation. And if I'm gonna burn the blank, SQUID is better, because it doesn't allow a big Z play.
