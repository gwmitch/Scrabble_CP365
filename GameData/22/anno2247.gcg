>Carl: EIMNSVW 8D VIMEN +28 28
#note Wherever you play WIVE or VIEW, you've done better than VIMEN. Even VIEWS sims higher. Quackle must really hate that W.
>Joey_M: ADQ E5 QAD. +28 28
>Carl: DEHLSWY G6 WH.Y +21 49
>Joey_M: ORTY H3 TYRO +16 44
>Carl: DELLLRS -LLL +0 49
#note Best. WO(LD) and DELLS 10C are close, but the exchange sims slightly better.
>Joey_M: EMOPRST 10G STOMPER +81 125
>Carl: DEGRSTU N4 TRUDGES +77 126
#note I remember agonizing over TRUDGES vs. GESTURED. Little did I know it would be a game-changing decision. 
>Joey_M: ABGKLSU L4 BULKAG.S +82 207
>Carl: AEEINOZ O1 ZOEAE +50 176
>Joey_M: AUV 3F VA.U +9 216
>Carl: ?IINNOR K10 .ION +16 192
#note I didn't really want to play IgNITRON 3D anyway, but what is the right play here? The sim wants me to play PINION, but that doesn't seem right to me.

>Joey_M: CIRU 2K CURI. +14 254
>Carl: ?AINORW 9G .OW +25 262
>Joey_M: CDEOR 14F CORED +30 284
#note Joey can't know that I have the blank, but as a champion-caliber player, he must smell trouble.
>Carl: ?AEINRS 15G REtSINA +88 350
#note Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I am unstoppable!
>Joey_M: ALO D7 O.AL +10 294
#note A fabulous play! If I recall right, Joey didn't have the blank when he played it.
>Carl: AEEGIIN N12 GIE +17 367
#note I can't block both lanes, so I may as well score.
>Carl: AEEGIIN --  -17 350
#note Or not.
>Joey_M: ?ADINPT C9 PAINTeD +83 377
>Carl: AEEGIIN 12A GE.IE +16 366
#note Further proof that my sense of judgment is highly fallible. I looked at EIDE 15A and I looked at GENIE and I couldn't tell that one of them is 18 points better than the other.
>Joey_M: BJ G2 J.B +19 396
>Carl: AEEILNN A6 LEANIN. +24 390
#note Just once, I'd like the obvious play to sim best. What should I have done here? @&#+*$%@#!!!!
>Joey_M: EFHITT C3 THEFT +29 425
#note Appropriate enough, as my opponent stole victory where it should have been well nigh impossible, if only I had locked it up.
