#note There are several different ways to groom the rack here, but there's also a good chance that bingos I draw won't fit.  This does open up the nice 6J spot for him, but it also creates T and R hooks in front and back of ABLE.  Plus it scores a bit more than the other rack groomers.  I'm curious what other experts would do here.

#note I don't remember the last time I had a game with Johnny O in which I bingoed first.
>Dave: ANOORUY J12 YOU +13 80
#note Already staring at a big deficit and seeing half the R's gone, I thought it was a good time to gamble.  In hindsight, OUZO and RAYON look like good choices, but fortune favored the brave this time around.

#note Tough choice here.  The leave is not great, but this scores so much more than the alternatives.
>O'Laugh: EIN N1 .INE +17 249
>Dave: AIIOQVW 5D WAIV. +22 246
#note QI might seem like the obvious choice, but if he takes away the spot for WAIVE on the next turn, I could be in serious trouble.  Plus, the Q spot isn't likely to go away.
>O'Laugh: BCO 4C COB +28 277
>Dave: EHIOQUY 12H H...Y +36 282
#note QUEY 6B for 50 points is obviously much stronger.  I could have done things differently on some other turns, but this is the only play of the game which I consider a mistake.  It's a big error, and that was all it took to lose this game.

#note Allows me to V stick him, but is best anyway because of my high scoring out.
>Dave: LOS 10J L. +4 362
#note Going out immediately with LOGOS 13G nets a couple more points than doing the V stick.
