>Jason: ADGOPQR 8F PROG +14 14
#note Missed PAGOD. Jeff asked if I played this instead of GORP because I was going for (PROG)RAMMED or (PROG)RAMMER.
>Jeff_Clark: ACEGIWY 7H WAY +19 19
#note Q likes WIG(G)Y a bit better.
>Jason: AAADEIQ 9C QADI +28 42
>Jeff_Clark: CEEGHIP 10D HEP +35 54
>Jason: AADEEIS 11D AE +18 60
>Jeff_Clark: CGIINR 12E RICING +15 69
>Jason: ADEEISS K5 DISEASE +92 152
#note Funny thing was: I was studying the 2K-3K sevens that morning and missed DISEASE's anagram. Not that it mattered here.
>Jeff_Clark: ?CEMORT L9 MORTiCE +80 149
#note Jeff said "Quackle will probably find something better," but this is best. Maybe MORTiCE(D)? Sacrifices six and doesn't slot the E in the triple, but I prefer this placement.
>Jason: LLORSUZ H11 Z.LLS +42 194
>Jeff_Clark: ?DFMNUV 6J M.ND +26 175
#note VUM at M8 cleans up the rack a little better, although it hurts the board.
>Jason: LOORRUW M3 WOR. +16 210
#note I think Jeff said something like "I don't know what to make of that play." Speedy likes WOUL(D), which I discarded.
>Jeff_Clark: ?EFIJUV 15D JIVE. +23 198
>Jason: ALLORUY L2 RAYO. +35 245
#note Thankfully both C's are out.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEEFUU -EFUU +0 198
#note Jeff's first "miss" of the game. FEU at N2 scores 24 and the leave is comparable.
>Jason: AILLNSU M8 LUNA +17 262
>Jeff_Clark: ?AAEGIN 8M .AG +12 210
#note Speedy likes other fishes, but they don't open the board. I like this play, esp. keeping IN.
>Jason: IILNSTU 15L .TUI +12 274
#note Missing LIN(G)UIST. Prolly cost me the game.
>Jeff_Clark: ?ABDEIN O1 DEBAtIN. +86 296
>Jason: ILNSTUU N13 UL. +6 280
#note And I'm rightly whacked for missing LINGUIST by pulling TUU.
>Jeff_Clark: AEFFHIT N1 EF +23 319
#note Did not know Q's top two choices: HAFFIT and HAFFET at 6C.
>Jason: INRSTUV J12 .UV +15 295
>Jeff_Clark: AFHIKTT 6F KIT +23 342
#note Nice block. Maybe KAT instead, though?
>Jason: EINORST 2K O. +2 297
>Jeff_Clark: AEFHOOT J2 FOH +31 373
#note Sewing up the game.
>Jason: EINRSTT 4H ET. +7 304
#note NT(H) is probably better.
>Jeff_Clark: AENOOTX 3E OXEN +14 387
#note INSERT, ENTERS, RETIES, ENTIES, ENTIRE, SEREIN ... none take the B and nothing in the ENTIRES rack plays. Better to block anyway, though.
>Jason: BEINRST 2E NEB +24 328
#note BISTER at 2B is the play. Or, block TOEA at C11. Gotta not mail in endgames like these.
>Jeff_Clark: AEOT 1G OAT +14 401
#note At least he missed it, too.
>Jason: IRST 4B STIR +11 339
#note Solid game, one mistake. But sometimes, one mistake is all it takes.
>Jason:  (E) +2 341
