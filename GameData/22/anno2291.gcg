>Marlon_H: UUUU -UUUU +0 0
#note From all I can surmise, this was actually what he exchanged.
>Carl: AGGHRSS 8G GAG +10 10
#note GAGS is best. One of the things I would learn following this tournament is that I tend to overvalue a doubled S. Against a champion player such as Marlon, telegraphing an S is unfavorable, but in this case, what I would betray is compensated by the more advantageous leave.
>Marlon_H: BDEOO J5 BOOED +16 16
>Carl: HILRSSY K3 SHY +32 42
#note The sim favors the tough-to-spot LYSIS K4 here by a large margin. I don't like that play one bit. I had considered SLY, which actually does outperform SHY. At the time, I didn't think the 6-point difference was worth the superior leave.
>Marlon_H: KNOY 4K .ONKY +38 54
>Carl: ?EILRSW O1 WIL. +30 72
#note I took some guff from some passerby for not playing a bingo, but WILY sims best. Both WRINkLES and SWINdLER allow easy comeback plays, and other bingos don't score enough to be worth it. Much obliged to Marlon for getting this play published in the newsletter.

>Marlon_H: ALRU O11 .URAL +18 121
>Carl: ACIJPPT 13G P.PTIC +18 240
#note Again my judgment fails me. I wanted to play JAR 14F and close down three lanes, but the leave of CIPPT turned me off. When I realized that I could still play JAR  after PEPTIC, it seemed like a great dump. The right play is CAPITA 14J by a light-year or two.
>Marlon_H: ?CIMNOR 15A aRMONIC. +83 204
#note Some neat symmetry here with the A*A bingos. 
>Carl: AEEEEJW H1 JEE +33 273
>Marlon_H: BOO 12K BOO +29 233
>Carl: AEEGHIW 3C WEIGH.. +38 311
#note I had seriously considered HI(R)E 14F, the sim-winner. I figured it was better to dump the W, even if it opened the board.
>Marlon_H: ADET 14D DATE. +24 257
>Carl: AAAEESV N4 .AVA +19 330
#note Huge mistake. My unbalanced rack blinded me to VA(MO)SE, for one thing. My opponent correctly determined that the possibility of ZEST 8L should have dissuaded me from KAVA. If I'm gonna miss VAMOSE, simply playing AA somewhere is best; AEESV is a fine leave.
>Marlon_H: EVX 4B VEX +49 306
>Carl: AEEIRSU M9 RI..SE +44 374
#note This time, the right play was a little more obvious.
>Marlon_H: DTZ E2 D.TZ +42 348
>Carl: AEEFITU 13B FEU +16 390
#note Quackle has some very harsh things to say about this. I still don't see how ETUI 11C is 21 points better than FEU, especially considering that ETUI empties the bag. 
>Marlon_H: U B13 .U. +12 360
>Carl: AEEILOT 2K AIOL. +20 410
#note The right sequence is TELOI 11B, (V)ISITAN(T) B4, AE F5. My solution is off by 4.
