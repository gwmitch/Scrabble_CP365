#note VAPOR is better, I disagree. Quackle always says I'm wrong, and maybe I am, I'm just very adamant about the whole vowel-next-to-scoring-spot thing.
>Jeremy_Jeffers: BEE H1 BEE. +28 88
>Phil: DDIIILW K2 LI.ID +18 64
#note WILD 10F is better; I'm not 100% on STAGNATED though, thought STAGNATE might be an adj or something, but then I remembered what it meant later on.
>Jeremy_Jeffers: GHRSU 10I SHRUG +26 114
>Phil: BDINOPW L8 WO.ND +26 90
#note UPBOW is best. Don't know it.

#note Thought about this for a loooong time and knew it was bad. YE J7 clearly is best, followed by a few exchanges (the best being EEIUY)
>Jeremy_Jeffers: MM F9 MM +26 306
>Phil: AEEGITY E9 EAT +16 284
#note I wanted to open another place to score on this tight board. However, Q still likes YE J7 which I didn't see and ICY F12.

#note GAYDAR B4 nets a few more points.

#note "I was only 99.5% sure on my out plays"
>Phil: GR 11A .RG +4 378
#note OK- by all means I didn't play perfectly. But besides missing an obscure bingo (BYRNIES) which I definitely should not blame myself for, I made a few small mistakes. Tiles kinda fucked me at the end.
