>Steve_: BEEKMTT L8 KE.TE +28 152
#note C-player likes F2 BETAKE by a few points.
>Chuck: AENORTV 15A RENOVAT. +86 216
>Steve_: ABBMTUY 14F BA.MY +38 190
#note There's a beautiful play available here that's worth 48 points. BARMY is second best.
>Chuck: AAIIL M4 AALII +12 228
>Steve_: BGILNTU L2 TUB +18 208
#note Didn't know the missed bingo, which would've been cute. Felt I had to make this play, even with three esses and a blank unseen.
>Chuck: Q 13G Q. +43 271
>Steve_: EGILNOY E3 YO.ELING +63 271
>Chuck: ADHOR D8 HOARD +40 311
>Steve_: IMNOPVZ F4 P.M +27 298
#note C-player puts this a point above the 40-point F2 ZON(A) in winning percentage.
>Chuck: EEFST 1H FETES +34 345
>Steve_: FIJNOVZ D3 OF +31 329
#note Big mistake, missing JIVY at 3B.
>Chuck: CIORU N2 CURIO +29 374
>Steve_: AIJNOVZ 4H JO +36 365
>Chuck: HU C2 UH +28 402
#note Chuck elects to leave two in the bag.
>Steve_: ADINSVZ B2 NAZIS +46 411
#note An attempt to win by going out in two, which is iffy, given my leave. I also considered ADZ C8. C-player likes (HOY)S for 18, leaving one in the bag. That puzzles me.
>Chuck: CEEGSTU M12 TEG +10 412
#note I get lucky to find the blank as one of the last two tiles in the bag. In time trouble, Chuck doesn't see I have an unstoppable out. His best play, CETE d8, loses by one.
