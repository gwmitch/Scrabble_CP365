#note Best.

>Noah: ADNOOST N5 ODA +22 92
#note Although my play bingos more often than ADO or SNOOD, these are both a smidgen better, because SNOOD scores enough points to be worth using the S. I don't understand why ADO sims better, though. Anyone have any thoughts?

#note Looks lie (N)O is strongly up there, by several points of equity. It is by far the best play, because it bingos half of the time next turn. ORPINE at 13G is rated second best, but this seems really weird. I think PROVEN is better than that, especially since it is quite likely that my opponent has the S. I guess ORPINE really does totally shut down the bottom right part of the board, which is good, but I still don't reall like it. With this play, I have the O for a high scoring play at either the A column or the H column and row 13, so I like this play, despite the fact that it ranks fifth. (N)O does make good sense, though.

#note This is best, but the coolest play here is the nice INFL(OW).

#note Looks best just to take the point here, rather than JA(B).

#note I looked at 4H, and didn't spot the tough AEgISES, but I didn't even think to look at D2, where SIAmESE or SEASIdE (which I saw, but didn't see a place) would have fit. Ugh. It seems like a lot of plays like SEI at D2 are better than this as well, this is WAY down there, a bad play.

>Noah: ADEEEGU L2 AGUED +20 359
#note So, this really isn't good! I could have sworn, huh. Anyway, it would have been sweet had a W been open. Thi play, even without being challenged, is another really poor choice, with many other plays best, the very best seeming to be D3 AGUE. This play almost cost me the game. I played fast in this game, and in all of the games tonight. I need to remember o play slower, be more deliberate about my choices and really look for a better play always. That should be my mantra, looking always for a better play I've heard it many times before, but it isn't having much of an affect on me.

#note Why my last play is so, so bad. I found the only play that wins. Can you see it? I was lucky to find this after totally being stupid in a couple of the moves of this game, and this next play was a bailout for me. I still thought it was a pretty good find, though.
>Noah: BCEEEFI C7 ICE +13 372
#note The only play giving me a succesful out in two.
