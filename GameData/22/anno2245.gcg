#note A bunch of plays sim within 3 valuation points of HUE. I considered HEMP, HEP, PEH, and HEM 6D. I'm not sure why I chose HUE over these choices, I guess I liked the leave better.

#note This is the best play for those of us who are human and don't know that HENIQUEN and HENEQUIN are both good (holy crap that's sick).

#note WIFED N10 scores 16 more but leaves OU instead of FU. Regardless, even though Q likes WIFED, I prefer WEIRDO because it blocks the triple-triple threat. I'm already up 99 and will probably be up around 130 after this play. I don't need to go for points, I just need to block the one spot that can get him in this game. I shouldn't be so scared about a 40-50 point (max) played with VITTAE.

>Richard_Popper: AEINRSV N8 RAVINES +95 325
>Phil: ANOOSTU G4 U.O +9 375
#note I saw AUTO N1 but didn't want to open the spot. I seriously have to know when to prioritize points over defense.

#note Ew. I missed BOCCE 2D and the sick BOCCIA 14B which I don't know. CAB and COB at 7K and 14F are better. Whatever, the game was over at this point.
