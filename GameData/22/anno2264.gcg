>Paul_Avrin: EILNOOR 8G LOONIER +66 66
#note I remember Sam Rosin had this opening rack in an Orlando game and debated placement. Similarly, Paul struggled to figure out where to put this. FWIW, Championship Player ranks them: 8D, 8F, 8G (this one), 8H, 8B, 8C, 8E.
>Jason: AFLSTUZ K5 FUZ.L +34 34
#note Opened by scoring 34, drawing into AST, and had 214 when the bag emptied. Yikes.
>Paul_Avrin: AAEIQ 6I AQ.AE +34 100
#note Picked up Q(U)AI to play this.
>Jason: AELSTWY 7F WAY +18 52
>Paul_Avrin: BEEIN 9F BENE +21 121
>Jason: CELSTUV M2 CUVE. +20 72
>Paul_Avrin: AIOT E4 IOTA +18 139
>Jason: GILMSTW 4C TW.G +16 88
#note I made very similar mistakes in my choke job vs. Tier; overvalued the S here. TWIGS at 8A for 38 is better.
>Paul_Avrin: FI F2 FI. +15 154
>Jason: AGILMST 8A GLIMS +38 126
#note Now I do the right thing.
>Paul_Avrin: IO 9A OI +7 161
>Jason: AAACDNT G1 CAD +18 144
#note I assumed Paul had a bingo, so I tried to create a spot where I could score decently next turn. Still, there are better plays, including AD in the same spot, which really lets me score next turn after a bingo.
>Paul_Avrin: ?DEEIST 10A DEiTIES +81 242
#note Nice fit.
>Jason: AAEHNRT 1G .HAR +27 171
#note Missed HAN(C)E at 2J and (C)HAETA, same spot as CHAR.
>Paul_Avrin: ORT K1 ROT +13 255
>Jason: ABENPTU D10 .UB +10 181
#note CUV draws into ELST, BPU draws into AENT ... yuck.
>Paul_Avrin: AIKRT 13B TRAIK +24 279
>Jason: AELNPTV C7 P.L. +13 194
#note Probably (T)AV at 6E. Gotta score.
>Paul_Avrin: ADENR L8 .ARNED +16 295
>Jason: AENNOTV 14A VOE +18 212
#note Maybe Speedy's pick of NOVA at M12? This is the always-fun equity-hemorrhage-to-open part of the game.
>Paul_Avrin: EINPY 15C PINEY +16 311
>Jason: ADENNST 5M .N +2 214
#note Bad play. Others give me a better win percentage without setting me up for disaster.
>Paul_Avrin: ?EIMORS O2 MOSsIER +79 390
#note After the game (he didn't post-mortem ... major upset), I said "Wow, you must've picked really well after PINEY, playing off five and getting that." Unfortunately, it came out as whiny as it reads. He did say he didn't have the blank or S when he played PINEY, though.
>Jason: ADENOST N1 TAD +26 240
#note Best, blocking XU.
>Paul_Avrin: GHJUX 12K J.UX +18 408
#note Best.
>Jason: ENOS 13J NO.S +23 263
#note This is the dumbass I am. I go "man, wish OXENS* was good," see 11 as my best out, do the math and see this is better. After the game, Paul points out E(X)ONS. Oops. No, really, I should be 1750 and D-1 in Dayton.
>Paul_Avrin: GH K12 ..G +11 419
>Jason: E N11 E. +9 272
#note Ugliness. Oh well. 2-1 after day one, as tired as I was that night after a long day ... I'll take it every time.
>Jason:  (H) +8 280
