#note My opponent later criticized this play as reckless, but it sims best. I find that Quackle usually approves of plays like this under dire circumstances.

#note Oh, so I couldn't find the bingo last turn? That's ok. Here, maybe this will be easier.

>Carl: DEIOPTT N2 PO.T +22 267
#note By a small margin, plays like TIPTOED 14H and PODITE 2J win the sim. The extra points compensate for the hot spots they open.

#note I would have thought closing the board would be a priority here, but it's not even close. BID 11D wins by more than 5 points. 
>Robin_PD: AEGS O1 ....AGES +42 349
#note This incited a meltdown. Just as in the previous game, I held for far longer than I should have, but again could not bring myself to challenge. The word looked so awful, but yet I figured that one of the world's top players would have more respect than to try such an insulting phony. Also, from my perspective, VENDAGES unloads the last E and S, and she will draw garbage from the bag, so it wouldn't be devastating to let it stay. It's almost funny the ways we justify our mistakes.

#note Flustered and now in time trouble, I see BIZ 11E a second too late.

>Robin_PD: IOOOSTX J4 .IX +28 395
#note Smart. I may have missed an 8 through the blank M earlier, but I wouldn't have missed CLAMMIER. The sim prefers stuff like OS 6J or OOTS 6I-- maybe because NIX allows QUINIC, which it subsequently overvalues.
>Carl: ACEILR K2 ....IC +26 451
#note Quackle says this is  best, but I'm skeptical. At the time, I realized that my outs would be blockable by OOTS 8L. Quackle may not be taking that into consideration here because OOTS doesn't score enough.
>Robin_PD: OOOST 8L OOT. +5 400
#note Best.
>Carl: AELR 7I RE. +17 468
#note Wrong. I had figured that AE 14A wouldn't be worth the block because then I can't play out in two, and she gets WHEYS and then OF J10. What should I have done instead?
