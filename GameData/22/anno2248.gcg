>Mike: CDEIMST K7 M.DIC +20 46
#note (DW) TIMESCALE H1 is a cool possibility here (sadly, it doesn't take a D).
(MF) Either TIMESCALE H1 (say what?) or DECEITS K5 (okay, that one I should see) are improvements.
>Bing: CEGMNOS 12H GENOM +31 89
>Mike: EGIORST H12 .ROG +18 64
#note GO 10F is a 10-point improvement; I'm surprised it's that much, but I guess the R really powers the leave.
>Bing: ABCPRSU 14F CR.UP +21 110
>Mike: EEHIOST M9 HOISE +33 97
#note Within a point of HOE 10F; guess I don't need to spend the S quite yet.
>Bing: AABENSV L4 VANE. +22 132
>Mike: DEILSTU N4 DILUTES +71 168
#note DUELIST N4 is a slight improvement (about 4 points).
>Bing: ABEORST O9 REBATOS +89 221
>Mike: AAEINPT O1 PATEN +30 198
#note PINETA in the same spot is 10 points better; didn't know it.
>Bing: DEFIOVW N1 OF +24 245
>Mike: AAFIINU -AAFIU +0 198
#note This or keeping AN is best. I suppose I could play through with AI M3, but with ??QSZ in the pool, I want the turnover.
>Bing: DEINOVW N14 WO +22 267
>Mike: GIIINWY M5 YIN +24 222
#note I got so fixated on slotting a Y in this slot that I didn't even think about putting the G there! WIG M3 is an 8-point improvement; I'm not making killer mistakes, but any mistake against Dave is a bad one.
>Bing: DEEINSV H5 VI...D +10 277
>Mike: AGIIIRW -GIIIW +0 222
#note Remember what I said two plays ago about turning tiles over to get to the ??QSZ in the bag? I really should listen to myself more often; exchanging all seven is best here.
>Bing: EELNQSY 10J Q. +31 308
>Mike: AAILRRT 5D ARRI.AL +20 242
#note See, I can get a play right occasionally!
>Bing: EEGLNSY 4C LYE +24 332
>Mike: ?EINORT 3E pOINTER +60 302
#note Find the three nines, one of which is a 20-point improvement over this. (I was never going to come up with that one; while I should at least find one of the other two, playing it is probably wrong.)
>Bing: AEGHNSW 2D HAW +33 365
#note I didn't like setting up an easy FAZE or FUZE, but I thought I'd still be able to win most of the time. Sim shows HEW 2J to be best.
>Mike: ?AAEFIT 1C FATtIE +42 344
#note (DW) It would take total confidence to challenge this play; I wasn't quite there. Now if Mike had played FAtTIE* instead, that would have been a different story. 
(MF) "Hold," I hear. Great, now I've just blown any chance I might have had at winning this game. After about half a minute, though, I hear, "Okay, go ahead." While this play sims ahead of anything legitimate (1 in 4 to win, as opposed to 1 in 8 for, say, EF at 2J - quick, what am I hoping to draw?), I shouldn't play it. One rule I've picked up: Don't play a questionable word to empty the bag. An aware opponent will challenge iff they can't win the endgame any other way; here, Dave has the win in hand. (For the record, I was attempting to block ZINE 1A and ZIN H1, and nothing legitimate does so.)
>Bing: EGINSUU 6B NEGS +19 384
#note This or ENGS is best. Having recounted on Dave's time, I knew I was doomed, but didn't realize how close it was until this play went down. At that point, all you can do is smile and shake your head.
>Mike: AZ J2 Z.A. +33 377
#note Me (after the last play was made):" I've already recounted it." Dave: "So you're satisfied with the one-point loss?" Me: "Well, no, but that's what actually happened!" Grr. As I was saying afterwards. you could line up any twelve non-Wiegand players you'd care to name. If I played them all in succession, I'd be an underdog in each game, but I can *guarantee* you I wouldn't go 0-for-12. I'm now 0-12 against Dave. Granted, I made mistakes in this game, but aren't I due to bag the guy at some point? Sigh. Maybe next time.
