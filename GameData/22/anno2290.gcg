>Dave: ABEGIJT 8G JAB +24 24
#note JIB has a better leave but gives the back E hook.  Knowing that Rod likes to aim for an open game on the first turn or two might have subconsciously affected my decision.
>Rod: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
#note Jeez!  If I had known he was going to trade and I would draw this, I would have played JIB.
>Dave: EEGISTT 9H GET +13 37
>Rod: AMOY 10G MAYO +27 27
#note Food word.
>Dave: EHIIOST 7I OI +13 50
>Rod: EINOOST 11A ISOTONE +68 95
#note I was all set to play HELIAST K5 until he opened up the triple lane.
>Dave: ?AEHIST A8 SHI.TAkE +149 199
#note Yummy!
>Rod: ABGR K8 GARB +29 124
>Dave: AEKLNRT 6J KNELT +37 236
#note It's possible to play off fewer tiles to keep a slightly stronger leave (e.g., KNAR), but at this score I prefer to take the points and speed toward the end of the game.
>Rod: ?ADEEHI D4 HEADIEs. +74 198
>Dave: AACORTV 5A CAV.ATOR +76 312
#note Beware.  It was my lucky day.
>Rod: ACFLRSU 12H CARSFUL +88 286
>Rod: ACFLRSU --  -88 198
#note This didn't look right to me at all, and I challenged it off quickly.  It's a helpful memorization device that the -FUL words which make -SFUL plurals are almost all either containers or kitchen measures.  Up to eight letters, HATSFUL is the only exception.  Yes, I'm counting handsful of spices and armsful of groceries as kitchen measures.
>Dave: DEGORTY 8K .YRED +42 354
>Rod: ACFRS 12K SCARF +36 234
#note As a verb, this could be considered a food word.
>Dave: DEGOPST B2 POT.GE +26 380
#note I like this better than kibitzer's top choices of PORTED N10 and DEPORT H1 because it doesn't create as many bingo lines for him.  It also takes away plays like RELAX and REWAX, and it's another food word.
>Rod: ELQU M10 QU.LE +28 262
#note It's a homophone of a food word.
>Dave: DELNSUW A1 WUD +28 408
>Rod: INPRU 14I PUNI.R +20 282
>Dave: AFILNNS 15H FIN +24 432
#note I first laid down FLAN, but then I saw three I's and no A's remaining.  Even the opportunity to put a fifth food word on the board couldn't convince me to risk drawing multiple I's.  Besides, you could make the case that my play also fits the category, e.g., shark fin soup. 
>Rod: EEVX H1 VEXE. +48 330
>Dave: AILLNOS I2 NIL +18 450
#note There's no reason to let him get down a lucky bingo up top.  This play also has the advantage of leaving row 1 open for a hook that only I can use.
>Rod: DIZ F3 DI.Z +34 364
>Dave: AEILOOS 12E SOLEI +15 465
#note Looks like OLIO 12F and SEA 5J is my best out in two.
>Rod: MNRUW 9C M.W +11 375
