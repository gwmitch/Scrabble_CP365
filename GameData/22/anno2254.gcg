>Phil: ABELNTZ 8D BLAZEN +40 40
#note I put down BLAZE and looked at my rack- NT. "Oh, why keep the N" 
>Rebecca_Lambert: ACELS J4 LACES +31 31
#note Neither of us questioned BLAZENS. Sadly, I actually considered challenging because I thought BLAZEN might be an adjective. :( PATHETIC
>Phil: ALNOSTX K3 LOX +40 80
>Rebecca_Lambert: EPRV L4 PERV +38 69
>Phil: AIJMNST 9F NAM +24 104
#note Why play RAJ without keeping an A? JALOP 4H is nice, didn't see it.
>Rebecca_Lambert: HIRT D8 .IRTH +20 89
>Phil: AAIJSST 10B JA. +26 130
#note Maybe I should have added the S to prevent the A front hook; Q still likes JAR best.
>Rebecca_Lambert: EEILNOP M2 BYED +38 127
>Rebecca_Lambert: EEILNOP --  -38 89
>Phil: AEIMSST 11C E.ATISMS +72 202
#note Ugh. I saw MISSEAT, but doubted it and didn't play it. I didn't see MISEATS. I don't know TAMISES or SAMITES.

#note I missed the sweet IODIN at N2.

>Phil: EGOOTVW 14J WO. +16 333
#note Basically I didn't want any chance for a 3x3. Losing by fewer than 120 guaranteed me third place, and a 3x3 could allow her to beat me by more than that.
>Rebecca_Lambert: GO 10L .GO +6 286
>Phil: EGGKOTV C3 VEG +30 363
#note TEGG C1 is sweet.

#note The K at 9C is nice

#note If you couldn't tell, I played this game pretty horribly, but my tiles (and her 4 consecutive <10 point plays) carried me through. I'm not pleased though.
