#note Should've exchanged again. I think I just didn't wanna go down 50-0.

#note Exchange keeping ES has been my best play for the first three turns.

#note After being on fire and making the best play like 7 times in a row, something had to give. I knew there was something thru the Y (CYDER). Regardless, CZAR is much better than just Z; guess I didn't consider wrapping it in CR.

>Phil: DEENNOR M1 NODE +24 425
#note NODE, which I played, wins 25% according to champ, whereas DOER 4B wins 50%. I saw DOER, but for the same points as NODE, didn't see why I should keep ENN instead of ERR. Besides, NODE allows for no parallel plays based on the unseen tiles and doesn't let him get the F or H on the triple except for NOH. I thought NODE was solid. Plus, NODE blocks a big hot spot. If he drops IF/RIF or something there, I'm pretty much done.

#note This pissed me off. I played very well this game and lost. I played pretty poorly throughout the morning and consistently won. Ugh.
