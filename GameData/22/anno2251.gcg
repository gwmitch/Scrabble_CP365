>Rebecca_Lambert: DFGOTUV -DFGOTU +0 0
>Phil: ?CHLOOO 8F OHO +12 12
#note Best play is CHOLO which I don't know. Second is COHO, but I didn't play it because I wanted a better leave for bingos (CLO? bingos 5% more than LO?). I don't mind OHO.
>Rebecca_Lambert: EOTT 7F TOTE +16 16
>Phil: ?CLORTU J2 CLOTURe +71 83
#note COURTLY E8 is best (didn't see it). The other bingos with COHO are nice but all take S's. I'll sacrifice 4 points for some D.

>Rebecca_Lambert: AIX 5J .AXI +53 111
>Phil: ?AGHILN K8 HALtING +74 190
#note I passed up on NILGHAI for obvious reasons, but missed NILGHAIs M4. LAsHING/TAXIS comes in second, but risks FLASHING and big plays along the O column.
>Rebecca_Lambert: IQ J12 QI +24 135
>Phil: DINSTUW I13 WUD +21 211
#note Sims best, despite all those unseen Es.
>Rebecca_Lambert: EOORV 15E OVER.O +30 165
>Phil: BEINOST 9B BONIEST +74 285
#note Again missing the sweet FROZEN spot with NIOBITES.

>Rebecca_Lambert: DENR 10C REND +28 211
>Phil: BGLPRTU 5D GULP. +22 345
#note The top two choices are BULGY and GULPY- I spent a while considering these options. BULGY sims a litter better. I guess the P goes better with RT than does the B.
>Rebecca_Lambert: EEGIINP -  +0 211
#note Challenged.
>Phil: ABEPRTV 12D BRAV. +20 365
#note BRAVE is fine, but I didn't see VERB at L3.
>Rebecca_Lambert: EGK 3L KEG +30 241

>Rebecca_Lambert: AIS L10 AIS +33 274
>Phil: ADEENTW 2F WE. +14 403
#note Unsurprisingly it sims poorly. I just wanted to wrap up the game by blocking the lane to the N. I guess there are more -ISM eights than -N but whatever, was just playing it safe.
>Rebecca_Lambert: FY 10J F..Y +18 292
>Phil: ADEINNT M7 DEN. +11 414
#note I pretty much failed at attempting to block this lane. DYE M9 is very, very restricting on bingos, but tIED is sweet and allows for none.
>Rebecca_Lambert: AEILRSS N8 RESAILS +85 377
#note Like I said, I failed at blocking.
>Phil: AEIINOT O4 TENIA +27 441
>Rebecca_Lambert: DE 7A ED +13 390
#note DIEL 3G was 3 points more.
