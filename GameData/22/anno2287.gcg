>Matthew: BEFOSSU 8G FUB +16 16
#note Sims best, beating out FUBS.
>Ross: AEEILNR 9D ALIENER +72 72
>Matthew: EGHOSSS 8A GOSH +45 61
#note Matthew: Sims best. GOSHES* is a phony.
>Ross: ?EEGHTY 10B HEY +26 98
#note Ross: Setup for T in column 1. Missed B6 GE(O)pHYTE.
>Matthew: ENOSSVY K4 ENVOYS +32 93
#note Matthew: ENVOY(S) C3 does indeed sim slightly higher. The third highest simming play is one I did not consider. ENVOY at 10J looks very interesting.
>Ross: ?CEEGIT 5E EjECTI.G +70 168
>Matthew: AAAIMSX F9 .XIA +27 120
#note Matthew: Sims best. There is no really good way to unload two A's, but AMAS A7 is close.
>Ross: IKNOQTW E11 KNOW +36 204
#note Ross: Max points, and keeps the QI together, but as Matthew pointed out, I might have known after ENVOYS that he had extra S's.
>Matthew: AAJLMSV 15A JAVAS +60 180
#note Matthew: Best without question.
>Ross: EEIOQST 11A QI +16 220
#note Ross: Quackle marginally prefers 13B OTI(O)SE for more points, keeping the Q, but I'd just finished a game where I drew the Q three times, so was happy to see it go.
>Matthew: ?ILMOOU E2 MOU. +6 186
#note Matthew: The bingo is MOdIOLU(S) which I had no prayer of seeing. MOU(E) is a weak attempt to fish and open the board. With this play, all the bingo lines are potentially blockable with one play. The best non-bingo play is simply (FE)U at 8G.
>Ross: EEILOST H1 LOTI. +24 244
#note Ross: Quackle prefers H1 OLEI(C), but vowels were getting slightly short at this point.
>Matthew: ?BILNOT A1 BLOTtIN. +83 269
>Ross: EEIRSTW 8K .EW +10 254
#note Ross: Aggressive setup for my S.
>Matthew: AADNRRU 7K .RA +12 281
#note Matthew: My attempt to block up the bingo lane and unload some double letters. It's not bad, but DURRA(S) and (FE)UD both sim better. Not sure if Quackle takes into account the fact that my opponent is quite clearly setting up a bingo. But I think ORA does much better due to that fact.
>Ross: AEILRST N2 RETAILS +82 336
>Matthew: ADNOPRU L1 PRON. +26 307
#note Matthew: I just don't know PANDOUR(S). That sucks.
>Ross: DINORUZ C3 ZOUND. +36 372
#note Ross: There goes the last high-scoring bingo lane, barring something fantastic on row 12.
>Matthew: AADEERU 1A .EAU +7 314
>Ross: ADEIPRT O1 PETARD +42 414
>Matthew: ADEEFMR H8 ..FRAMED +45 359
#note Ross: Ha ha, Matthew lies like a rug! You actually played H8 (UN)FARMED* to invite a possible challenge. I was unsure.
>Ross: CDGIIT 12A ID +23 437
>Matthew: E I8 ..E +10 369
>Matthew:  (CGIT) +14 383
