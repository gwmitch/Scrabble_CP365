#note I knew I shouldv'e exchanged here. I guess I figured that EGQ is manageable, especially if I draw a U or I. In the future, I should just get rid of horrible racks, not try to fight through them.

#note Yes, I will exchange eventually. However, it's not best. ZEK J6 is a good option that I didn't even consider- in fact, I don't think I looked for plays, just exchanges. I guess taking 36 points then probably exchanging is better than exchanging without being guaranteed 36 points next turn.

#note Don't see the merits of BLITHE or HILTED at 14A. I considered these, but why give him a TWS to work with. Either way, BLUEISH 3G sims best, but don't know it.

#note LOL- at least it sims best. I was pretty sure it wasn't good, but maybe if he challenged it he'd open up a spot for ILLNESS.

#note I was so fuckin scared that this would be good. If it were, I probably would have lost.

>Phil: EENPRVW N2 PEW +29 370
#note I saw PREEN, but why keep VW for 4 more points. Plus, there's only one N unseen, so I can probably make a big play from O1 if he doesn't use it.

>Ben_Schoenbrun: ELNPV 12L PE.L +24 327
#note He missed a few plays to get rid of the V, which I didn't see either.
