#note Missing the sexy EYEwAT(E)R...doh...I wanted to play YAw(M)ETER, but it was less points (groan).
>Matthew_Silver: AEIMOQU H1 QU. +36 171
#note Matt says he completely spaced on QUAI...not that it had any effect on my next play...
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: CEEEIRR E5 RERE.ICE +98 247
#note I can has luckbox?
>Matthew_Silver: AEIMOTU 10A .M +23 194
#note Matt just wanted to score and not use many tiles, but we agreed that ODIUM is not a bad idea...
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: GIILNOZ L1 ZO.IL +48 295
#note Quackle likes ZO(R)I "a lot" more...(About 5 points or so)
>Matthew_Silver: AEEIOTU 1K A.OTE +42 236
#note He didn't really consider (Z)OEA, but in hindsight it was probably a better play.
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: AAEGINO 7I O.A +10 305
#note Why am I dinking up 60?
>Matthew_Silver: DEINNRU M5 INURNED +62 298
#note Can you find the common word, but tough best play?
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: AEEGINV C3 VINEGA. +26 331
#note I didn't really give this play much thought. Quackle doesn't hate it. Matt liked VEG, which is good too, but I figured with SSS? STILL unseen, turnover seemed like a decent idea. The two plays are almost even, but VEG wins by a slim margin.
>Matthew_Silver: ABDILST 8L B.AD +30 328
#note Matt overdrew. I picked SSD off his rack...

#note He has at least that S...
>Matthew_Silver: AFILSTX 10H FLAXI.ST +72 400
#note So much for blocking the E...
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: EEJNRUW 11J NU +24 381
#note I just can't see myself playing J(O)W here, because I don't want to maybe give him two shots at blocking it. With enough tiles in the bag that I will get it the next turn, it seems reasonable to block the X spot, and play J(O)W the next turn...or hit something big for a nonbingo...
>Matthew_Silver: BDGILOU 4F GOD +28 428
#note Here's one for you...FULGID. I guess BOG was probably better...
>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: AEEIJRW C11 J.W +26 407
#note Quackles says JAWE(D) or JEWE(D) is way better, any ideas? J(O)W went down instantly. I'm convinced it is right...there is still LLSS? to draw from - 5/12.
>Matthew_Silver: BGIKLNU 14A BULKING +96 524
#note Shit.

>Conrad_Bassett-Bouchard: ?AEEIRT 13G ARIETtE +70 477
#note And that would be my highest loss ever. Couldn't quite reach 500 though. Really awesome game, glad to be a part of it.
