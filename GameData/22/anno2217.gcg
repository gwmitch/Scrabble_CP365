>Jason: AIMORWY 8D WORMY +34 34
#note This or MIAOW.
>Jeff_Clark: BCCPUWZ F6 CU.B +14 14
#note UPB(O)W is the star play. Jeff said this is where his mistakes began; should've exchanged here. But CURB is ahead of all exchanges instead of keeping Z.
>Jason: AABDIQU 7H AQUA +28 62
>Jeff_Clark: ACIPVWZ K6 C.PIZ +18 32
#note Another turn Jeff said he should've exchanged on, but Speedy's top play is a little weird: V(A)W at K6 for 9?
>Jason: BDEIRTT 9I BR.T +9 71
#note Thought this was probably a mistake; indeed, it's not on Speedy's radar.
>Jeff_Clark: AAEFTVW 7A FAVA +19 51
>Jason: ?DEEIOT A7 .OETID +36 107
#note Figured I was missing a bingo, but there's only one: EpIDOTE. Still, shoulda seen it. Put down FOE, figured I might as well keep going. Only three equity points behind the bingo.
>Jeff_Clark: DEFIRTW 8K .EWIT +36 87
>Jason: ?AAEEIJ 10H JEE. +30 137
>Jeff_Clark: DDFHNRY B6 F.RD +21 108
>Jason: ?AAAAIN -AAAI +0 137
#note If I'd offered to give up my excess A's at this point, Jeff probably would've taken it. Speedy likes AA at 7M.
>Jeff_Clark: DEHLNVY N7 V.NYL +19 127
#note (W)HY/(BRIT)H is pretty cool.
>Jason: ?ANNSSU 12H SUNtANS +76 213
>Jeff_Clark: DEGHMOS C9 HOMED +41 168
#note Another cute potential play: (J)O(S)HED.
>Jason: DEHLLPS D10 PEH +34 247
#note Discarded Speedy's three better plays (HELP, HELD and HELL at D12), because at this point the board was shut up, no sense to open.
>Jeff_Clark: EEGGOST B13 EGG +13 181
#note Three potential cute plays in a row! GEEG(AW) opens and the leave's solid. (Note: I would've missed all three of these plays, too.)
>Jason: DLLORSU 11F LOUD +22 269
#note "He has no fear!" Jeff said. "He has no block!" I retorted.
>Jeff_Clark: EGKNOST H4 TOK.. +13 194
>Jason: AEILRSX L12 .X +9 278
#note "I'm gonna leave it open again!" I said.
>Jeff_Clark: EEGINRS 4G S.EERING +68 262
#note Better than GREISEN/(AX)E, opens another lane. After I almost certainly bingo, Jeff needs to give himself a shot at a comeback. "C'mon, maple leaf!" he said as he went in the bag (obviously we played with my Canadian Protiles).
>Jason: AEILNRS 14H NAILERS +78 356
#note "Well, I don't have the maple leaf," I said. "Don't say that!" Jeff said. "Well, you'll get it now," he said. I looked at my count: 11 in the bag. "7 in 11 chance," I said. Unless it's me, of course, in which case it's more like 50-50. :)
>Jeff_Clark: AEIOORT 3F OI +6 268
#note Championship player likes A(G)IO. I'm inclined to agree. Better line, but now I can outrun the out bingo with all one-pointers left.
>Jason: IIILNOT 15E INTO +18 374
#note "There's the maple leaf!" Jeff said after his pick. I think I had the right idea, just missed LOIN at 15G.
>Jeff_Clark: ?AEEORT 2B REsET +16 284
#note Jeff saw all five sevens, but none play. Even though it doesn't block the out, I like OvER(STEERING) for style points. (Counted as 17.)
>Jason: AAIIL A14 AA +18 392
>Jeff_Clark: AO 7M O.A +15 299
>Jeff_Clark:  (IIL) +6 305
