>Todd: Q G7 Q. +21 21
>Jason: IMORTXY I4 OXIM.TRY +74 172
#note The two placements actually sim fairy closely.   Based on my opponent, I judged he would be more likely to find MU for 30 than a 4 for 40+.

>Todd: AELNR D10 LEARN +18 114
>Jason: BGNNTTU H1 BUNT +27 281
#note The two positions sim very closely again.  I actually missed the LEARNT hook this first time, and thought the other spot was more dangerous.
>Todd: AEEGRSV C13 EAR +12 126
>Jason: FGGNTUV 2J VUGG +35 316
#note Despite the hook I prefer this to VUG for 33; against this opponent only I know VUGGY and at any rate, 2 more points to get FNT instead of FGNT is good.  VUGG sims very slightly better by a couple.
>Todd: DORU M2 .OURD +14 140
>Jason: ADEFINT 15A FA.TED +40 356
>Todd: IIW 14H .IWI +19 159
>Jason: CGINNPS K8 SPIN +29 385
#note Error here.  I should have played PINGS.  Assumed JUBILEES would be more points than KIWIS, but the 6 from the P makes it very very close.  [-4]  Good to take out the S lane with all 4 Ss unseen.
>Todd: AOZ L11 AZO +26 185
>Jason: CFGHNVY 4L Y.CH +32 417
#note UGH!  Forgot VUGH.  Wanted to save the Y for VUGGY anyhow.  Sigh.  [-14]  I spent a TON of time on this turn and couldn't find the right play.
>Todd: CENOS 15K SCONE +32 217
>Jason: AFGNOSV O1 FAS. +30 447
#note FASH is slightly worse on equity than a couple other plays, but wins every time.  The pool looks pretty good at this point with a blank out and I really don't need to lose to a 3x3 here.
>Todd: AIIO -IIOA +0 217
>Jason: DEGNOTV 13K V.TED +24 471
>Todd: EHORS O8 SHORE. +33 250
>Jason: AEGINOP 14B P.. +18 489
#note I was low on time here, and furthermore, I didn't know PANNE, which I woiuld have played had I known it.  However, GIEN n7 appears 3 points better. [-20ish]
>Todd: ?DEIILT 3C LIsTE. +12 262
>Jason: AEGINO N9 AGO +22 511
#note There's those weak 5s again... AGONE and time trouble led to missing quite a few points here [-9]
>Todd: DI M8 ID +14 276
#note A good start.  When I lost all the time failing to find VUGH, things fell apart and I ran out of time to do the endgame properly.
>Todd:  (EIN) +6 282
