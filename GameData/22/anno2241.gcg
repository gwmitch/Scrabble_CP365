>Phil: ELMNPRT 8G LEPT +12 12
#note I don't agree with Q's choice of Exch. LMP. Shoulda seen PERM though.
>Judy_Newhouse: INOV 9D VINO +11 11
>Phil: DEMNNOR E8 M.ND +14 26
#note Q likes DORMIN E5, which I don't know, and VENDOR D9 by a few valuation points.
>Judy_Newhouse: AFKLS 12B FLASK +32 43
>Phil: EEINOPR 10G PEREION +66 92
#note Shoulda played PEPERONI for style.
>Judy_Newhouse: OW 13C OW +19 62
>Phil: BHIIQST 11A QI +16 108
>Judy_Newhouse: AE 9I AE +12 74
>Phil: BEEHIST N6 BHEESTI +82 190
#note When we discussed this phony after the game, me and Judy both figured it was good simply because there are so many variations of the word (BHEESTY, BHISTIE, etc.) Regardless, BHEESTIE to the triple at H1 is best.
>Judy_Newhouse: BIR 8L BI.R +27 101
>Phil: ?AADDOU O12 DUAD +29 219
#note Wow, I am thoroughly embarassed. I wrote down AOUDADS on my paper but was pissed because it hooked onto BHEESTI, which I didn't know the validity of. I figured she would challenge and it wouldn't be good. Of course, I couldn't see the tough spot at 13F!!!
>Judy_Newhouse: ACDEGRS -ACD +0 101
>Phil: ??AAIOS 7M A. +9 228
#note AH beats out a few of the bingos, of which there are many. I saw a few, but they all sucked so much, giving big counterplay while barely scoring 60 with both blanks. I figured she would open a better oppurtunity.
>Judy_Newhouse: TUX 14A TUX +30 131
>Phil: ??AEIOS I6 SE...AtIOn +62 290
#note I saw all the bingos to the D, but come on. It's a fucking 10.
>Judy_Newhouse: OY J14 YO +27 158
>Phil: AEFIORR 11K FIA. +28 318
>Judy_Newhouse: LU D7 LU. +12 170
>Phil: AEEIORR F12 .OI +9 327
#note I didn't wanna player AERIER C3 and let her bingo. KOI isn't good, but doesn't suck either.
>Judy_Newhouse: ACEHOST 8C C.. +7 177
>Phil: AEERRTU 6F RUE. +6 333
#note Didn't even consider looking for bingos. Half the time, I think my brain just stops working.
>Judy_Newhouse: GNO E4 NOG +14 191

#note WRATH is fuckin dirty.

>Judy_Newhouse: N 13F .N +3 285
#note (She went over on time so she really only scored 281). I hope I don't lose money tomorrow because of spread, cuz I seriously dicked around at the end of this game and lost a ton of spread points.
