>ernie: ?AEFPRU 8G FEU +12 12
#note Even though I recorded this rack as ?UPFARE, I did not see the common word here. Not a good start. 

What's the best fish? Play long with FEUAR, get some points, but risk a five-pick? Obviously my play runs the risk of a constricting reply. Sim gives FEUAR a slight edge, but it's less than one WP point. UP is another play-short option. Don't like PAREU, as the F is too much of a bingo brick.

#note Six extra points for PRACTiSE. Sorry, Allen. 
>bert: WZ 3G W.Z +28 52
>ernie: AAAEIIV -AAAIIV +0 98
#note I didn't make a knee-jerk exchange here, but I'm surprised Quackle would play through. Top simming choice is VIA K4, scoring 17 and leaving AAEI. IVIES at 4D and CAVIE at 1H are also duck options. My exchange drops a couple of win-percentage points. 
>bert: ADEEMRT 1H .REMATED +92 144
#note Even if the C had been covered, REMATED plays nicely with CRISPATE-D, or can hook on the K column. 
>ernie: AEEGGIN K3 AGEE +15 113
#note The -ING game tends to be grossly overrated, but that's how this one has to be played, unless you prefer AGGIES 4C. SAGE 4H also gets some sim run. 
>bert: ?EEIKLR O1 .EeRLIKE +89 233
#note Bert's winning odds are now over 90 percent. Looking back now, four days later, I wish he had put the blank at O2. 
>ernie: DGIINOY L3 YOD +28 141
#note YO is a little better than YOD, keeps the D and doesn't constrict the area as much. YOND scores 36 but takes away the N that's desperately needed. YOD is just an eyelash behind YO, but nothing wins more than six percent here. 
>bert: DEO M1 .OED +27 260
>ernie: EGIILNV 6F VI. +14 155
#note It's the sim choice, with LIVES 4D a little beind. Nothing wins much. I'm going to need a ton of luck. 
>bert: EILOTT 4B LITOTE. +19 279
>ernie: EGILNOW D4 .OWELING +63 218
#note Okay, here's one piece of good luck - I needed a floater and I got one that worked. But my bingo is an airball and it sets up a juicy S hook with three unseen. My winning percentage only goes up to ~8 percent here, in part because anything that hooks TOWELING is going to score very well. 

I didn't know if TOWELING took an S, and to be honest, I tended to doubt it. But I certainly wasn't sure. In my position, this isn't the worst thing in the world, a hook that both players might be uncertain about. 
>bert: ABH 3A BAH +28 307
#note This could also be played to the left of TOWELING for 33. 
>ernie: ENOQSSU 6N Q. +31 249
#note I get very lucky with an extremely favorable draw here. If I'm sure of TOWELINGS, or if I even like it, I slap down SUQ and my winning chances double. They might go up a lot more if it's challenged. But I'm still thinking on the side that it's likely bogus, and if I play SUQ and it's punted off, the game is probably over. Thus, I took the boring, safe play. As is so often the case, the bottom line is "know more words."

Quackle's Plan B if I don't play SUQ is NOES 12A, scoring 36, drawing to SUQ, and potentially hitting a home run with the Q. But SUQ is clearly best by a considerable margin. 
>bert: CLY E2 CL.Y +28 335
>ernie: EGNOSSU 12A GUNS +40 289
#note Saw NONGUESS* at D10 but let's not be silly. Now it's time to cash TOWELING-S and hope that I get one of the two favorable outcomes (it's accepted, or it's challenged and ruled good). Bert held for a decent amount of time but eventually gave it a very reluctant wave through. I'm now winning about 14 percent of the time. 
>bert: HIOR B10 HO.RI +32 367
>ernie: AEINOSU G8 .OU +7 296
#note Time for some combat scrabble. I really wanted FOU to be the best play here, but it's behind a few things. Quackle likes EAU at C8 (and I see why that's best), followed by a slick 40-point play that you should try to find, just for fun (I'll mention it next page). 

EAU wins 5 percent of the time. My play is at 3.9 percent. My feeling is this: if he has the X already, I'm probably hosed - it scores well at C9 with just about any vowel. If he doesn't have the X, he has to deal with what FOU could mean. Maybe he overreacts to the threat. Maybe he breaks up his rack to influence the area. And obivously my -AEINS save has potential with the remaining pool. This opening might also buy me another change to hit HOURI-S for a thicker bingo. 
>bert: AINPV N8 PAVIN +22 389
#note The play mentioned last rack was SAUCIER 2B, 40. 

PAVIN takes an S hook up front, by the way. Not relevant for this game, but good to know. Those sneaky S hooks. Simming PAVIN as a partial rack, this is 97 percent to win (it does better at K9, or as VINA at A7), but I'm about to get crazy-lucky. 
>ernie: AEINNNS 13H NANNIES +77 373
#note Stupid double-N draw. Wait a minute, glorious double-N draw. I'm only 18 percent to win, though, because the end of the game will have to fall perfectly. I still need to get mad lucky.

NANNIES at K9 doesn't sim much worse, despite being 11 points less and giving some stuff away. I wonder if it's Quackle not playing defense right, the idea that it might let an opponent Triple-Triple or spike the J through 14J.  
>bert: ABIOST A5 BIOTAS +29 418
#note Bert didn't have the J yet, so his other tile is either an R or an E. If it was an E, he missed a ridiculous bingo - an easy word conversion but a silly fit on this board. If it's an R, nothing radically changes from the rack missing a tile. 

Quackle's CP likes playing BIB at A1, leaving one in the bag. I haven't played a lot of games against Quackle, but I tended to notice it loves to make endgame plays that leave one tile in the bag. Not that it's any revolutionary theme, but it reinforced to me what a good idea it really is (not all the time, but most of the time). When I simmed the possible moves (as a six-tile rack of BIOTAS), BIOTAS came out up front, with BIB and AB 2A close behind. I can see the upside of trying to race out, especially if he has the E. It's a little more risky without it. 

Take a good look at my next rack. I've got some wins, but I didn't find them. 
>ernie: AAMRTUX F10 XU +50 423
#note A few things here. He obviously has no outplay, and there's not much he can do with the J. JEE at 7C for 18 is best, and then it's just piddly stuff like JO and JAR for nothing. 

My best play is to take RAX C7, which scores 41 and cheapens his J. Then I'll have an out somewhere near turn - MAUT on the 14th row, or top hooking JAR if ge tries a block that way. But what's cool about this position is that if I play MAX instead of RAX at C7, I lose to best play (he drops his J for 9, I can't get out, and RE will score enough). 

I could also take AMRITA L10 or TAMARI L8 or 11L, neither which give him anything. Then I have XU in two good spots, the obvious F10 or at C9. Winner. I didn't see that. 

I didn't have as much time as I'd like for this position, to be honest, but I wasn't going to find AMRITA, and I don't know TAMARI. I finally took the obvious XU, not sure yet what I'd do on the next turn. We both had maybe a minute remaining. 
>bert: EJR 7C J.E +18 436
#note This is best, but Quackle also knows it's a theoretical loser, because I have an outplay. 
>ernie: AAMRT A12 .AMA +27 450
#note The AMRITA/TAMARI plays go out and win. I'd also win with AMA if MAL* was a word. GAMA is the best non-outplay, and the only tie. Go, mediocrity! 
>bert: R N1 .R +10 446
#note Best, and a tie. Bert said "recount" immediately, which surprised me for two reasons: he was 0-4 at the time, and he wasn't recording the words. I had to steer the recount. But all the scoring held up. Not a perfect game by any means, but a fun game. A weird game. I guess they're all weird.
