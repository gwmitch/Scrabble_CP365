>New_Player_1: AEIOORV 8D VIREO +24 24
#note Top quackler! off to a good start
>Quackle: AHLS I6 LASH +21 21
#note Wishing he'd of gone first and given me that L to play through...
>New_Player_1: AADEOTT J5 OAT +11 35
#note liked OAT for the D hook and I have a lot of easy ways to stack...plus it'll leave the VIRE open as well, when drawing to ADET that could be useful.
OTTA(V)A wins the sim by ~0.5 pts, but I'll drop that equity against a lower rated player to keep the board open and flexible.
>Quackle: BBI 4J BIB +20 41
>New_Player_1: AADEEIT F7 E.ADIATE +65 100
#note yup...
>Quackle: ACFT 14C FAC.T +10 51
#note must've been very afraid of that hook...

>Quackle: ACMR 15A CRAM +45 96
>New_Player_1: IOQRSWZ 12D ZO. +29 177
#note I pussed out on W(I)Z...too afraid of easy payback.  Considered QIS, but just couldn't do it.
>Quackle: ENORY 15G ONERY +26 122
>New_Player_1: EIQRRSW K3 Q. +11 188
#note lots of options here, I figured my opponent may not know the reradiate hook so I thought playing just Q(I), saving WRIER for the next play, or even just retaining the R hook for a bingo if I can manage to draw I, O, or T (11/50)
>Quackle: OV I13 VO. +10 132
>New_Player_1: EIRRSUW 6B WRIER +30 218
#note play the Q, draw the U...
>Quackle: ??AEGLN L8 LEAsiNG +76 208
#note thought there was a chance windings might be fake...plus, he ain't scoring on the next turn (challenging = forfeit next turns score)
>New_Player_1: EGIRSTU -  +0 218
>Quackle: AKNP 8K P.ANK +33 241
>New_Player_1: DIISUUX G7 D.X +43 261
#note OK, the WRIER draw didn't pan out.  But I have to cash D(E)X and exchange next turn..
>Quackle: DEFLOSU N6 FU.D +16 257
>New_Player_1: IIPSSUU 5H UP.S +46 307
>New_Player_1: IIPSSUU --  -46 261
#note Going to take the points here...but manage to demonstrate how rusty I am....
>Quackle: EILOOST L4 .EL +5 262
#note well...he tried to block...I guess....
>New_Player_1: IIPSSUU 5I P.S. +46 307
#note DUH
>Quackle: GIO 10L .GIO +18 280
>New_Player_1: IIIOSUU -IIOUU +0 307
#note kept IS
>Quackle: ET D8 .ET +6 286
>New_Player_1: EEEINOS 13K O.E +6 313
#note well...not sure how he was able to play VET if I just put all those vowels back and drew all of these ones...OGEE and EOSINE are death by J.  Lots of other small plays are all pretty equal.
>Quackle: OSTY C3 STO.Y +24 310
>New_Player_1: EEHIINS 4C .I +4 317
#note OK...J plays on that T can really, really hurt.  TI blocks most of them.  he can still get JETE...HEINIE sims best, I guess it is enough to outrun most plays, but I didn't see it that way...plus my opponent was low on time, so extending the game would net me 10 more points ;)
>Quackle: ELMU O3 MULE +12 322
>New_Player_1: EEHIJNS C9 HE +20 337
#note this will be fun...I set up JET, if he blocks I get JINS, and he still can't go out, so I play out in three.
Quackle likes GHEE, then JINS
