#note Yikes. I'm already in a really poor position, and I'm definitely not the favorite here. I was trying to open up here, but it just isn't a great opening. I thought of HAE 9K, and i think I maybe should've played it, because it's difficult to block.

#note Just not effective at all. I need to play AI 15A here and block scoring spots while hoping for a good bingo, I think.

#note I was hoping he wouldn't know AWNINGS or something, which is just stupid. AWNING 4G is probably fine, though maybe something else altogether is called for. I could've played WIZBANG, but that was unlikely to work :).
