>Jim_Burlant: JLNORST 8D JOLTS +40 40
#note I'm normally not a fan of burning the S on an open to play for 8 more points than holding it (e.g.:  FIRMS for 28 instead of FIRM for 18), but in this case there are too many points available not to take them.  This is best, nothing else worth considering.
>Maddy_Kamen: IIINOW H4 WINO. +12 12
#note Maddy told me post-mortem that she had 3 I's on this rack and in her eyes it was a tossup between whether to put this down or exchange.  Not knowing her 7th tile, a 300-iteration 2-ply sim suggests that exchanging is best, with IWI(S) H5 being the one play that was worth making.  This choice sims roughly 3-1/2 points and 2% winning chances down on exchanging.  
>Jim_Burlant: AABEENR E3 ANAER.BE +70 110
#note The only bingo, and it wins 81%.
>Maddy_Kamen: BEIOT D10 BOITE +18 30
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIOSY D2 OFAY +34 144
#note This scores 35 at I4, but the sim agrees with me that this is the (marginally) better choice; this takes away possible power tile bombs at D1.  Both plays are winning 91%.
>Maddy_Kamen: EIKSY 15D SKIEY +48 78
>Jim_Burlant: EHIINST 4H .HINIEST +80 224
#note The only bingo.
>Maddy_Kamen: DMPU F10 DUMP +23 101
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADEQRR J2 QA.D +34 258
#note Comng directly on the heels of my last game with Heather Steffy, I came tantalizingly close to playing QAT O2 for 12, just to make sure that what went around didn't come back around.  But there were just too many points available to play so fearfully, especially since I was sitting on the blank.  This is best, nothing else is worth consideration.
>Maddy_Kamen: ERV O1 VER. +21 122
>Jim_Burlant: ?AERRRU 2J .UAER. +30 288
#note No 8's are available, and the only good rack balancers (M2 RUER, 13F PURR, and 12F MURR) give up way too much on the scoreboard.  This is best.
>Maddy_Kamen: EGTV M1 V.G.TE +20 142
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEOORR N4 .ORORAtE +65 353
#note Thought I might have missed something better on rows 12 or 13, but there is nothing else - this is the only bingo.  Total equity loss to this point:  0.
>Maddy_Kamen: EGM 8L GE.M +27 169
>Jim_Burlant: ?AINOPR 14G RAmPION +71 424
#note If there's a learning point to be taken from this lopsided game, it's in this position.  While it's more easily said than done,  even when the game is clinched, always look for the best play, and always be aware of the unseen tile pool.  I did none of those things here.  Look at the pool and look where I've recklessly placed the O.  If I make one of the smarter choices I really didn't evaluate effectively (PONIARD, PADRONI in the same location) she doesn't go on her late-game tear to hit 300. The sim says that, while it wins 100% (duh), it's a 4-point dog to 11H CAPONIER.  It's much worse than that; in this game this mistake conservatively cost me  50 points of spread.  
>Maddy_Kamen: ADNW 15L WAND +47 216
>Jim_Burlant: CEEITUU 11J CUTI. +14 438
#note Couldn't think of CUTUP, which would have been better to unload both U's.  Nothing really scores here.

>Maddy_Kamen: AGHN 13L HANG +31 272
>Jim_Burlant: CDILSTU 13F .IC +20 478
#note A cool play was available that I didn't look very hard to find:  S(T)U(P)ID 13C 31.
>Maddy_Kamen: ELLOZ 2B ZO. +24 296
