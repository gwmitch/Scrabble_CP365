#note I think this is a deceiving sim; while this does a very nice job preserving a promising rack fragment, there are too many easy front and back hooks to give up so many points.  Whie the sim says this wins only 0.5% less often and only concedes 1.3 equity to WITAN 8D, I think WITAN is much stronger and should have been the play.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: CJOU 7D JUCO +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: ADIINTU 6G DUI +11 23
#note Oh, how I wish I had an O.  Q prefers the J8 placement by a hair; even though I had  a T in my rack, I didn't want to give up the T back hook with 5 unseen. Cesar has almost always had the most uncanny luck against me and I didn't want to give him he easy run to the 2x2.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ABO 5I BOA +14 34
>Jim_Burlant: ADFINTV J8 DAVIT +25 48
#note Best.  Also scores 28 at L1, but the scoring difference just isn't enough to justify slotting row 1.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: INOV 8A VINO +34 68
>Jim_Burlant: EEFNRXY 9B FEY +31 79
#note Best.  Other strong choices include D3 REENJOY (really?  You can enjoy again?), 4K FERNY, L1 FEYER.  Play incorrectly scored as 30.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: AABY K5 .BAYA +24 92
>Jim_Burlant: EGKNORX 11I G.NK +18 97
#note What do you do if you don't know that ABAYA takes a front K?  Practically every good option in this position requires that knowledge, and as such I had no clue what to do.  I rejected KEX I11 because I thought it would easily give back too much at 15H, and eveything else gave up easy back hooks.  This is a mid pack choice, and the sim winner is 4K KEX.  I ultimately settled on this (which is rather weak) because (a) it was the only thing I saw that didn't give up easy front hooks to the triple and (b) it kept my REN.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: LOOS 10D SOLO +20 112
>Jim_Burlant: EEHORUX L11 .EX +28 125
#note Couldn't remember if the legit 5-letter X word was HEXER or VEXER (they're both good, I thought one of them was bad), so I chickened out on L1 HEXER, which is the standout.  This is mid-pack, but this game may have turned out very differently had I put down HEXER.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ADM 11E MAD +25 137
>Jim_Burlant: EEHNORU M12 HUE +35 160
#note I saw two viable plays here:  this choice and M13 UH.  Thing is, I knew he was sitting on another S.  But I figured there was already the DAVIT S-hook and that the most likely occurrence was that he'd use his S to take out row 15 for 35 or 40 points.  What happened afterwards pretty much sealed my fate, and from this point forward I had zero chance.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?EEIRST 15G TERrIES +78 215
#note Any of his bingos win 74 - 75% in a short sim.  Best is vERIEST 15H.
>Jim_Burlant: CEEMNOR L1 COMER +30 190
#note REEN(JOYS).  As for this choice - Not thrilled about having to blow this otherwise promising rack apart, but I need to open this board and stay in the game whle doing so.  This wins just shy of 22%.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: GISZ 13G ZIGS +36 251
>Jim_Burlant: ADEENNR 1L .ANE +18 208
#note Weak - missing ENDEAR M3.  Even best play only wins 19%; this wins 12.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ELP 2K P.LE +18 269
>Jim_Burlant: ADEINRT 3L .AT +19 227
#note Where was this rack 2 turns ago when I could have played it?  Notmuch else for me to do as far as I can tell - just open up a line and hope I hit it before he does.   I put this down still feeling I had a chance.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?AELRRS O3 SnARLER +74 343
#note Oh, for the love of God, you've got to be kidding me.  The other bingo is SURREAL.  This is now over except for the final score.
>Jim_Burlant: DEINRRU J3 DU. +4 231

>Cesar_Jaramillo: EFLOT 3E LOFTE. +15 384
>Jim_Burlant: EGNPQRW H12 Q. +21 272
#note With better play I don't lose as badly, but the ABAYA front hook was beyond my knowledge and from that point forward I really had no chance.  This one just wasn't mine to win.
