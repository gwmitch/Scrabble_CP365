>Odie: DDGMOOS 8B DOGDOMS +78 78
#note Is Odie daring to play ME in a game of words? That stupid, slobbering mutt doesn't stand a chance against my overall superior vocabulary and intelligence.
>Garfield: ACDIMOT -  +0 0
#note Dogdoms, Odie?  Only in your canine dreams is that a word.
>Odie: AAEGLNS H1 LASAGNE. +80 158
>Garfield: ACDIMOT -  +0 0
#note I may have made an uncharacteristic mistake with dogdoms, but not with this.  This fleabag can't even spell my favorite dish correctly.  
>Odie: AAAGNSS 1H .ASAGNAS +83 241
>Garfield: ACDIMOT 3B CATDOM. +30 30
>Garfield: ACDIMOT --  -30 0
#note ....Why you MANGY...I bet you think you're clever, don't you? Well, you're not.  But I must admit I didn't expect this.  I have the best word on my rack:  CAT.  But that won't be enough.  Wait! If dogdoms is an acceptable word, then surely CATDOMS must be!  Yes!  Take THIS!
>Odie: ?HOOOTT E8 .OgTOOTH +72 313
#note OUTRAGEOUS!  Who thought of these words, anyway?  How can DOGdoms be a legitimate and not CATdoms when cats are superior? Something just isn't right here.

#note Dogtooth?  I don't think so.  What a poor attempt.
>Odie: ?AACILT 11C CA.TAILs +59 372

#note I have a way to go, but his luck can't go on forever.

#note Deerlike?  That can't be...no.  I haven't been right yet.  I need to catch up.  Eh, what's the score?

>Odie: ERRVWXY 4D V.X +45 838
>Garfield: IIINPUV -  +0 70
#note Deerlike I can take, but ZAX?  I'll be vexed if another of this mongrel's made up words turns out to be acceptable.
>Odie: EIRRRWY N3 W.RRY +26 864
>Garfield: IIINPUV 10M PI. +7 77
#note I must admit I'm a tad worried.  And vexed.  And riled up!  What's the score again?  
>Odie: EILR B4 RILE. +8 872
>Odie:  (IINUV) +16 888
#note I suppose even canines can get lucky every once in a while.  I had horrid letters the entire game and I didn't even see a blank or an S.  How about a game of Pictionary?    Game "played" by TJA
