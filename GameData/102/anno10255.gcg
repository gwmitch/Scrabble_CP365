>Jim_Burlant: AAHRSXY I3 YAH +22 22
#note Irritated that I had this rack and didn't go first with it, so I didn't recognize that HYRAX  played at I1.  HYRAX is best; this is weak.
>Mike_Waugh: AEEMRSY -AEEMR +0 26
>Jim_Burlant: CLMRSSX 4H ..LMS +18 40
#note I bungled my first play pretty badly, but I got this one right.  With 18 points available, there's no reason to exchange when I can leave myself 4 positive tiles.  
>Mike_Waugh: IOT K3 O.IT +12 38
>Jim_Burlant: ACILRSX G8 XI +22 62
#note Despite giving up huge points on the scoreboard to RAX 2H, Q likes this best and it's 66% to win.  10H SIX is also worth consideration.
>Mike_Waugh: DIJN F9 DJIN +32 70
>Jim_Burlant: ACFLRST 11D FL.C +18 80
#note Best, as it preserves the ARST leave.  If the bingo doesn't come, I still have the S for a potential play at H11.
>Mike_Waugh: EEP 12B PEE +20 90
#note This was reckless.  It's one thing to open up an exclusive hook that only you have (e.g.:  a word only takes a front D, the blanks are out, and you're sitting on the last D).  But it's another open up a high-probability hook to the triple line.  Granted, I don't know how many E's he had in his rack. But even if he had 4 of them, it was ill-advised to open an E hook with 7 of them unseen.
>Jim_Burlant: AEFKRST A10 FREAKS +49 129
#note Where I began to realize the bingos probably wouldn't happen was when I drew the F as the first tile out of the bag after having dumped the other one.  His play of PEE smelled like a setup for an E hook, and taking that out was my first priority.  Maybe KERFS 11A would have been a hair better to preserve AT and not allow any sort of play down the B column.  But I don't mind blowing this up for 49 points.  Q doesn't like this much because I'm breaking up the whole rack instead of keeping the much more powerful ES with KRAFT H11.  Q also preserves KAF 13A keeping ERST.

>Jim_Burlant: AGGORTU 14A .AGU +18 147
#note Knowing his rack, I was hoping to bait him into burning his blank to play his Q.  Even simmed against a random rack this isn't bad, though 13C TUG doesn't open up the triple.  
>Mike_Waugh: ?AEEQRT B6 QuARE +42 132
#note His best play is clearly 2H QAT leaving EER?.  When I asked him after the game, he replied that he did know the A front hook to YAH.  One mistake many of the lower-rated players make is that they don't assign sufficient value to the blank.  Unless you're in a late or end-game situation where you need to make the game-saving play, or if you've got both blanks in your rack and want to split them, the blank needs to fetch somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 - 28 points more than the next best play that doesn't use it.  This is not a good decision by Mike, and a 2-ply sim confirms it.  2H QAT wins 43%.  This choice wins 31, and sacrifices 21 points of valuation.
>Jim_Burlant: GHOORTV 8A G.VOT +30 177
#note  What would I have done with this crap if he hadn't opened up 8A?
>Mike_Waugh: EOTU 6B .UOTE +16 148
>Jim_Burlant: DEHNORW 15D HONED +48 225
#note Kept the R because I did want to start building a rack.  Q says I should have played it for 3 more points.  Whatever.
