#note Lucky to have multiple X hotspots open -- I can take out this hotspot with the W now, and save the X-bomb for later. Sims best.

#note This sets up POON for 40 next turn, which is pretty sick.

>Evans: ADMNRUZ D8 ZA +44 259
#note The sim recommends NURD 14B, presumably leaving the Z spot open to fish for MATZA. A cool play that I didn't think of over the board.

>Evans: CDMNORU 1F MUCRO +31 290
#note My thinking here was that Nigel would have a distinct tempo advantage no matter what I did here, so I needed to leave bingo lines open. This leaves line C open and gives me line 2 to work with. Hoping to make something happen here. Sim slightly prefers MOUND C9, which does keep a stronger leave. Perhaps I'm overthinking the board dynamics.
>Nigel: EEIOOOS -OOOE +0 283
#note The pool is low on vowels, especially I's, so keeping EIS is better than just ES. Nigel and Quackle agree.

#note Wanted to keep scoring to put the pressure on. Would have been nice to block bingo lanes here, but there are two big ones open and I don't know which to block. If I guess wrong and he bingos and I haven't scored anything, I could be in trouble. Taking points while I still can seems like the best tactic.
>Nigel: ?BEGGNY M10 YEGG +26 427
#note This appears best -- burning the blank with BAGGY 2B for 53 is certainly an option, but Nigel would have to get extremely lucky to draw a bingo from there. He's more likely to come back with 26 now and a blank bingo later.
>Evans: ADNORTT B10 DO +16 504
#note This leaves one in the bag and blocks the more dangerous bingo line, points-wise -- BORNEOLS, BROOKITE, and BONTEBOK are all killers, and they're out of the picture now. Emptying the bag with something like DOAT O7 is not an option -- I can easily lose to a bingo out.
