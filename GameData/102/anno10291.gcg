>Jason: EEGINPQ 9C QI +25 45
>Peter_Schwartzman: NRTUY 11B RUNTY +28 46
>Jason: EEGNPTT 12A PET +12 57
#note (L)EPT. Take the three points, don't be so obsessed with keeping the I open for ING bingos.
>Peter_Schwartzman: IMR A12 .RIM +24 70
>Jason: AEGNOTY 13C AGONY +32 89
#note G(RE)ENY would've been sweet. This is a solid second, though.
>Peter_Schwartzman: BBM H7 M.BB +10 80
#note Uh, that's not a word. It looked bad, but it's been so long since I've reviewed my fours and it's one that wouldn't be seen often, so I figured I just forgot it. Trust yourself, Jason.
>Jason: AELNOTX 10H .OX +28 117
>Peter_Schwartzman: EOW 12G OWE +15 95
>Jason: AEELNRT 13I TELERAN +69 186
>Peter_Schwartzman: ?ADEITZ O8 ZEATI. +48 143
#note Peter told me his rack after the game. Looked for a while for a trip-trip, or any bingo through TELERAN, but the only playable one is the inferior DEuTZIA.
>Jason: AAGLORU I1 ARUGOLA +65 251
>Peter_Schwartzman: ?ADILTU 1H D.TUrIAL +122 265
>Peter_Schwartzman: ?ADILTU --  -122 143
>Jason: DINOSSW 1H W.DI +24 275
#note I felt the need to block this even though I didn't see anything (mostly because there's nothing there).
>Peter_Schwartzman: ?ADILTU 15A .ULTIDAy +83 226
>Jason: AFGNOSS -  +0 275
#note Should've let it go, obviously. I figured it needed to be hyphenated. FON at 14J to take an 80-point lead and set up my G. Should've been more disciplined.
>Peter_Schwartzman: AH N10 HA +28 254
>Jason: AFGNOSS 14J FON +31 306
>Peter_Schwartzman: ACEEINS 3H E.CAINES +70 324
#note I really should've let MULTIDAy go.
>Jason: ?AGJSSS 5H J.GS +24 330
#note Duck says I'm 73.79% to win after this play; didn't feel like it. (CP prefers JOSS.)
>Peter_Schwartzman: EEKV N2 K.EVE +28 352
>Jason: ?AEIISS 14N IS +24 354
#note A do-everything play: scores, blocks DEFT etc, undoubles, leaves one in the bag, slices, dices and makes julienne fries.
>Peter_Schwartzman: FO 4L FO. +24 376
>Jason: ?AEHISV O1 HI.S +38 392
#note 99-% on LAVISHER/VANISHER, probably wouldn't have trusted RAVISHER if I'd seen it, and 99+% TRENDER* was bad. More piddling spread away.
>Peter_Schwartzman: DEENRT 2C TRENDE. +16 392
>Peter_Schwartzman: DEENRT --  -16 376
#note Joey walked by during this sequence and said he got away with TRENDER* against Kenji once. Made me feel better that I was almost sure it was bad.
>Jason: ?AEV 7K AVEs +19 411
#note Sloppy at times, but I'll take the W.
>Jason:  (DEENRT) +14 425
