#note I didn't play PUNG because I always seem to think it means PUNGENT or something, so I'm not sure if it takes an S. I'll remember now!

#note I decided to go for defense here. Holding the H, I can get an easy 50+ if I draw an S, and there aren't many ways to get huge scores with any other tiles.

#note Much better defense than SAIGA. 14C is still a very viable spot, but I think it's worth avoiding giving up anything too easy.

#note After I made a joke about how ugly his rack must be, he mentioned that WAVERING was unseen to him, so I decided to block OX and possibly have VERSING to go out...
>Opponent: BBORTXY K10 BOXY +40 375
#note ...except he had a much better play in that spot all along. Duh. Maybe I should've considered the rest of the rack.
