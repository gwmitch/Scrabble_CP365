>Jim_Burlant: BDEINOR 8G BO +8 8
#note I felt 22 points just wasn't enough to justify breaking up this rack, and Q agrees - this is best.
>Judy_Newhouse: AAQU F5 AQUA +38 38
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRT H8 .RIENTED +80 88
#note Best bingo.
>Judy_Newhouse: EMOP E2 POEM +24 62
>Jim_Burlant: AHIOSTY D1 HOYA +41 129
#note If I had to whiff, this was a good miss.  Best is 15E TOADYISH; this is the best non-bingo option and it wins 80%, simming roughly 16 points down.
>Judy_Newhouse: ?EILNNV 10G L.VENINg +62 124
#note Judy had initially put down 11C ENLIVENS and picked it up before settling on this.  I asked her about this after the game and she told me that she didn't feel comfortable placing the I under the triple-letter, and that brings a teaching point:  like I told her, this early in the game, 8 points is a little too much to give up for something like that.  And, sure, if there's an equally high scoring option that doesn't have vowel placement issues, by all means make sure you don't get reckless.  But if your only choices are 70 and 62, you don't worry too much about what you're giving back when you're scoring 70 points.  Later in the game, when the opponent is almost certain to have the unseen X or Q that could decide the game, then you worry about it.  But not this early.
>Jim_Burlant: IILSTUW 1A WIT. +30 159
#note Best - the only options that unload the U give up too much on the scoreboard to do it.
>Judy_Newhouse: BDII G3 BIDI +27 151
>Jim_Burlant: AILSSUU 9C ULUS +19 178
#note Q gives marginal preference to 9B LUAUS, but this worked out.
>Judy_Newhouse: FMR L9 F.RM +18 169
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGISVX 8A SAX +39 217
#note Hmm.  Don't know why I didn't think of SIX, but surprisingly Q likes this best.
>Judy_Newhouse: DEFGNTT -DEFGN +0 169
#note !
>Jim_Burlant: ?AGIOOV H1 AVO +22 239
#note Or OVA.
>Judy_Newhouse: DOY I3 YOD +23 192
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGIJO J2 JO +34 273
#note I don't quite get this - Q wants me to play 12D JADING for 4 fewer points.  I wanted to dump the J and leave row 12 open for a bingo ending in ING.
>Judy_Newhouse: EEP K10 .EEP +20 212
#note And Judy saves herself 20 points of spread.  I was going to play this same word on the 2x2 for 90+.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADGIIL 12B GLIADI.e +68 341
#note 14A placement scores 72, but now that I'm leading by 119 points I don't feel like giving back a potential ZIGS for 72.
>Judy_Newhouse: GW E11 W.G +14 226
>Jim_Burlant: EEEORTZ 14F ZE. +32 373
#note Not bad, but DOZE F12 scores 37 and unloads the extra vowel.
>Judy_Newhouse: CNORS K3 SCORN +24 250
>Jim_Burlant: AEEORRT 15F AR.OR +19 392
#note Anything is as good as anything.  Besides the style factor, I liked this because it killed row 15.
>Judy_Newhouse: AFL 4K .ALF +18 268
>Jim_Burlant: EEEGKTT 6K .EEK +18 410
#note Passing up much higher scoring plays.  I didn't really have a good block for the triple; I just wanted to make sure she couldn't bingo down the triple line.  This isn't one of the original kibbitzer chioces but it wins more than everything else except 6J GREEK.  Somehow I couldn't think of GREEK.
>Judy_Newhouse: CTU J6 CUT +30 298
#note Only as she was figuring out her next move did I notice the REEK front hook, which she beat me to.
>Jim_Burlant: EEGRTTT N10 .ETTER +10 420
>Judy_Newhouse: AEHIINS O6 SHIN +33 331
#note Play scored as 32.
