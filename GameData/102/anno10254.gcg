>Jim_Burlant: AEEFLNT 8D FETAL +24 24
#note  Have to admit that I auto-piloted this play.  8G FE did warrant consideration and I wondered afterwards if I should have played short to keep AELNT together.    The 2-ply sim says either one is as good as the other.
>Daiva_Markelis: IPZ 7C ZIP +33 33
#note Good thing she didn't have an E or A.
>Jim_Burlant: AABEEHN 9G BAH +24 48
#note None of the leave options are great - q prefers 9E HAE, keeping ABEN.  
>Daiva_Markelis: JO 10F JO +30 63
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEENU 10I EAU +10 58
#note What can I say?  I haven't studied my six-vowel nines just yet, so E(PI)fAUNAE was a little bit out of my league. :-) As for plays that humans rated under 2000 would find, this is best.
>Daiva_Markelis: INOQ K9 Q.OIN +28 91
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEELNR 14E LEANERs +74 132
#note I didn't like the board position with this choice, but didn't think it was worth giving up 8 scoreboard points to play 12E tREENAIL or 12E FLANERIE.  Q disagrees.  tREENAIL wins 58%; this wins 57 and sims 2 points down.
>Daiva_Markelis: EOTUV 12G OUTV.E +20 111
>Jim_Burlant: BEEIORW 15G WORE +36 168
#note Don't like playing off my ER, but a good leave isn't salvagable, and 36 points are too much to pass up.  Q agrees.
>Daiva_Markelis: IY E5 YI.. +18 129
>Jim_Burlant: BEFGIIT D3 FIB +23 191
#note Hmmm.  While the difference between the choices is in the realm of style preference, Q prefers D3 GIB by 2 pionts and roughly 1% winning chances.  I'm guessing that's because it's expecting me to draw an E and it wants me to play EF/BYE on the next turn.  I'd rather build another bingo rack.
>Daiva_Markelis: IRS 3B RI.S +14 143
#note Safe to say that Daiva's sitting on a second S.  Until further notice, sims are run against an inferred S.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGIOTT M10 GODET +25 216
#note Best.  I'm 80% to win with this.  Given my lead I'm not too concerned about the S hook on the triple line.  Worst-case she'll hit me with something like SOX on row 15 for 38.
>Daiva_Markelis: ESX 15M SEX +38 181
#note And the worst-case scenario pans out.
>Jim_Burlant: AAHIITT I9 ..A.H.. +17 233
#note Sims are no longer run against an inferred S.  I saw AHI L8 and didn't like the easy bingo lines it created.  Looking back now, for the life of me I can't understand why I passed up 15C AHI.  Since I didn't like any of the I dumps I saw, I saw this cute play and liked the style points.  This is not a good choice as it doesn't balance the rack.  Fortunately there are only 2 I's in the pool so the likelihood of drawing into a rack with triplicated I's aren't that high.  
>Daiva_Markelis: AAIRV 15A VARIA +29 210
#note And if I play AHI 15C like I should have, what does she do with this?
>Jim_Burlant: ADIILTT 13B ILIAD +18 251
#note For some strange reason Q still loves these plays down the L column that open all sorts of easy lines.  I'd rather force this opponent to give me somewhere to score.  I'm still 60% to win.
>Daiva_Markelis: EW 11E YO +19 229
>Jim_Burlant: ?CEEKTT B2 T.EK +16 267
#note One of the traps to avoid when dealing with racks that don't balance for enough turns is that, the instant you do have a rack balancer available, you just auto-pilot the quick dump that balances the rack and you don't make your best play.  I let myself get suckered into this very trap.  While this preserves the nicest possible leave in this rack, it is a poor choice.  CREEK scores 42 and should have been the play.
>Daiva_Markelis: EW A1 WE +17 246
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDEGRT 4A C.D. +13 280
#note Looking at this pool, I saw the lack of vowels and made a point of holding onto my E at the expense of scoreboard points.  Q wants me to dump the E - pfft.   This is the best play I have that does not unload the E, and it's the sim runner-up to F4 GED.
>Daiva_Markelis: EIMORST 2E EROTISM +65 311
#note This is the only bingo and, against my rack of AEGMRT?, she's still barely 20% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGMRT 1G GAM +31 311
#note Daiva's audible reaction to her post-bingo rack made it clear she hadn't drawn many - if any - of the vowels, and the I reaped big dividends from playing C(E)D(I) instead of GED on the last turn.  A click of the "Generate Choices" button verifies what I concluded after burning my time down from 8 minutes to less than 2:  no bingos play.  I opted for this, reasoning that I should close to within 1 and use my balanced rack to outrun her in the end game.
>Daiva_Markelis: NU 1K UN +7 318
#note I've got a pretty good idea of what she's got in her rack.  Unless she's got UNCUS in there, she's got no chance whatsoever.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EGOPRT N9 GO +10 321
#note Q wants me to fish for the bingo with I1 MIG.  I had decided when I played GAM that I wasn't going to worry about the bingo.  Had I managed my time more effectively, I'd have had enough time to enumerate all the possible draws.  Quackle's preferred choice of (MI)G I1  gives me a potentially playable 7 or 8 with practically every possible one-tile draw.  And even if I draw a no-go, my rack will be balanced enough to outrun her.  This choice wins 100%, but MIG should have been the play.  This cost me roughly 60 points of spread.
>Daiva_Markelis: D 10M ..D +5 323
>Jim_Burlant: ?EPRTU J2 .PURTEd +10 331
#note STUMPER scores 14.
