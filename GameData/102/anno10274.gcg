>Richard_Spence: ABEFOPR 8G FOB +16 16
#note Second best to PREFAB 8D or 8G. Opponent told me after the game he had NARRATO(R) if I had put the R down, though.
>Lewis: AIINRUV 9G AR +11 11
>Richard_Spence: AEGIPRY 10G GAPY +28 44
#note Best play
>Lewis: AHT 7H HAT +19 30

#note DORMIE for 25 sims best.

>Richard_Spence: CLNPTUW N6 CL.P +14 174
#note I admit I blew the past two plays, missed CL(OM)P and C(OM)PT the turn before. Oh well.
>Lewis: ?AINRST O9 ARTISaN +75 168
#note TARNISh 11B 77 is interesting

#note Forgot about LOWE. 
>Lewis: AT 2M TA. +19 205
>Richard_Spence: EEIIKOU 15K EIKO. +10 226
#note Wow, EIKO(N) is a terrible play. Quackle prefers exchanging to anything.
>Lewis: OV 3H VO. +13 218
>Richard_Spence: EEIMSUZ 11C MEZES +40 266
#note EMEUS sims 0.2 points higher
>Lewis: ILRV D8 VIL.R +24 242
>Richard_Spence: AEHIIOU -AIIOU +0 266
#note Best play, exch. AIIOU.
>Lewis: EEU C10 E.EU +16 258
>Richard_Spence: BEHOQSY B8 YOB +25 291
#note An awfully dangerous play, especially with the blank still unseen. Quackle still says it's the best by 1.5 points.
>Lewis: ADDE A6 DEAD +36 294
>Richard_Spence: EGHIQSS 14A QIS +31 322
#note Another dangerous play, but still the best play (by far)
>Lewis: ?AGIINO 15A IN +41 335
>Richard_Spence: EEGHIST E11 .EE +15 337
#note Probably my favorite play of the tournament. With ~40 seconds left, I play (Z)EE E11 15 hoping to set up SIGHT 14E 24 to win. The opponent can't easily block, because any play (including sAUNA) will be followed by (D)IGHTS which also wins. If the opponent plays on column B (e.g. GUANO) I win by 7. Quackle actually likes THESE B2 25, but it also loses because opponent could play GUAN A1 28 and I'd have no out play.
>Lewis: ?AAGNOU B2 GUANO +21 356
#note I think sAUNA has the best chance of winning, because with 40 seconds left, I might be tempted to play HI(N)T for 33, in which I'd lose by 1.
