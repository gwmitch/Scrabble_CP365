#note with two in the bag, how can B12 OUT possibly be best? i don't remember what i thought i might accomplish with this play. i guess i saw THYROID, and thought if he bingoed to make FIGS, he might magically give me an S so I could hook it?  who knows. i think probably i had given up by now. the other thing i had considered was playing IVY to empty the bag. as it turns out, that would've won. go figure.
