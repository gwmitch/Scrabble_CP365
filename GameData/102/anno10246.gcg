>Jim_Burlant: DELOOOR 8G LOO +6 6
#note Hmm.  Whle this is best, one other option worth considering would have been exchanging OO.
>Jackie_Camper: GIP J8 PIG +16 16
>Jim_Burlant: DEEIORR K10 ORE +9 15
#note No great options here - This is one of 3 plays (the others being 8g LOOPIER, 9F ROE) that vie for sim winner honors.  Nothing scores in this position, any of the 3 plays in question is as good as any other.  Against this opponent, who rates in the high 1200's, I'm more inclined to keep things open given how quickly it will probably shut down later.
>Jackie_Camper: AEISTTU F8 SITUATE +68 84
#note Best bingo for Jackie - at 7A it scores 72, and at L5 it scores 64.
>Jim_Burlant: DEGIRWX I7 G.X +38 53
#note I only saw WIRED and couldn't think of the common word anagram, WIDER.  Sad, but true.  The sim says that this or WIDER are identically strong plays and gives a marginal nod to this.  I think that WIDER should have been the play, though I sort of catch a break.  I'm 34% to win with this.
>Jackie_Camper: EENS 15F SEEN +20 104
#note Initially annoyed to see SE come down as the first 2 tiles, but after she finished her play I was feeling quite confident about the outcome:  if she wants to burn EENS for 20 points, let her!  I don't know what she had in her rack but I'd be surprised to find this was the best play.
>Jim_Burlant: DEIIORW L8 WIRED +38 91
#note Best.   WIDER scores 37 and the one-point difference in the score is the total equity difference in the sim.  Nothing worth considering past these two choices, and I'm 31-1/2% to win.
>Jackie_Camper: EHY 8L .HEY +39 143
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIOSY J12 FOY +24 115
#note Or at 14H.  Either is as good as the other, but I thought this might leave the board marginally more amenable to 8's on rows 12 and 13.  I'm playing just about perfectly right now, and I'm barely 29% to win.
>Jackie_Camper: HO I13 HO. +24 167
>Jim_Burlant: AABEISS M12 SAB +18 133
#note  Right idea, wrong execution.  Best is a word I never find, ISBA M11. Q also likes 7M plays like SAB and ABA, and those look stupid to me - I need to keep this board alive so I can play an 8, and any of the other choices (except ABASIA 12A, which is reckless) kill lines I need to stay alive.  Despite the sim's gloomy assessment, I don't feel I'm out of it at this point - all I need is the right high-probability draw (RN or something like that) and I'll be in the driver's seat.
>Jackie_Camper: ADO 7M ADO +19 186
>Jim_Burlant: ACEISTT 11E C.T +10 143
#note No bingos play.  I'm surprised Q doesn't like this more, since I'm sitting on the case S.  Q wants me to play N13 TIC and N13 TI.  This wasn't one of the original kibbitzer options but it sims as the bronze medalist.  Against this player, I think this was definitely the play.
>Jackie_Camper: EF H11 EF +15 201
#note I was crossing my fingers she wouldn't have the E, because I picked the wrong time to forget that CUTE takes the front S.  Given the number of tournament games I've been having of late where I'd typically go 5, 6, 7 turns without drawing an E, I was hoping that the fates would be kind and that, for a change, my opponent would be unable to draw one.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEGIMST N13 MIG +24 167
#note FAIL.  Not only did I pick the wrong time to forget that CUTE takes a front S; I also picked the wrong time to forget that GAMIEST has an anagram, SIGMATE, that would have made the hook I did see.  The bingos win 53 and 51%, respectively.  From this point, the tile gods made sure my winning chances were zero.
>Jackie_Camper: NO O14 NO +20 221
>Jim_Burlant: AEMSTUV 14B MAUV. +20 187
#note Now I'm seriously rattled.  As far as I knew at the time, I thought I had drawn into a no-go GAMIEST (completely my fault it didn't play but at the time I didn't know that).  And now, despite the pool with all those juicy bingo tiles unseen, I draw a U-V combination?  Are you kidding me?  I was starting to come unglued.  I was too dead set on keeping the rack together, and this made it too easy for her to control the board.  D10 MAUVE was the play.  This was auto-pilot.
>Jackie_Camper: AJR 15A JAR +36 257
>Jim_Burlant: DELLSTT 6K LED +11 198
#note Hated the vowelless leave but I had to keep the board alive.  H10 LEFT is the sim's preference.  Annotation stops here, as I have too many holes and cannot reconstruct the game.  From a pool that always had at least 50% vowels, my next racks after this were ILORSTT (left myself SIT), CILSTWZ (played WILTS for 31), CDILNUZ, ACDLNUV.  By the time I got to a penultimate rack of CDELNR?, there was no bingo available, and the board was shut down.  Final score 352 - 331, Jackie's win.
