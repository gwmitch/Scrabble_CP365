#note Game of inches ... JAG last turn leads to FERULING this turn. Instead I lose more time off my clock deciding what to do. (PI)LAF leads sim, but that seems too gutsy. Almost certainly better than this. No idea what to do. Went the turnover route.

#note This rack is easier to play post BERTHING if this spot stays open... (Have you picked up on the fact that I regret missing BERTHING?) Maybe I got too concerned about the X. And why didn't I keep the D? Pool is super-duper vowel-heavy. Did I want ? or X that badly? Was I that concerned about AIDE hooks?
