#note I elect to hold the X because I have spots at E11, G3, and 7M. I saw DIOXIN and chickened out because I'm the worst. I didn't see OIDIOID. FFFF.

#note I play this because I know he doesn't have the N and I do. I think it's too cute, I probably should have played WHITEN D4 to block LOAC(H).

#note The TEG spot is mine, so I'd like to hold the S. VROW hinders the C line and kills all lines through LOOEY. I think I've got this won now, until...

#note This leaves three in the bag, almost assuring I go out first. It also holds OIST, so if I pull that J I hit JOIST/TEGS for a lot.

#note He's low on time, I block the obvious JIBB on a DWS to net a few more spread. In other situations, I wouldn't try this.
