>Richard_Spence: AEEKNTU 8F KUE +14 14
#note Best play, but Quackle prefers 8G to 8F.
>Travis: AFNO 7H FANO +13 13
>Richard_Spence: AEINTTY 8K YENTA +32 46
#note ENTITY is slightly better.
>Travis: IO F8 .OI +9 22
>Richard_Spence: HIMRTTU E9 THRUM +27 73
#note Either HUT 6I 23 or M(O)HUR 9E 30 (a word I didn't know). THRUM is third best.
>Travis: DNO L5 DON. +13 35
>Richard_Spence: AGILRTT 6K G.T +11 84
#note There goes RATTLI(N)G. ATTAGIRL, seriously?!
>Travis: AINSW 14A WAINS +27 62
>Richard_Spence: AAILRST 13E .ARITALS +62 146
>Richard_Spence: AAILRST --  -62 84
#note There also goes ALAR(M)IST. Didn't know SALARIAT :(
>Travis: AA A13 A.A +18 80
>Richard_Spence: AAILRST 13C LA. +16 100
>Travis: BN 12D B.N +20 100
>Richard_Spence: AAEIRST 12D ...A +6 106
#note A risky play, but Quackle prefers fishing this play.
>Travis: LX G11 L.X +18 118
>Richard_Spence: AEILRST 11G .ITERALS +66 172
#note Or (T)ERTIALS, but I didn't want to open a TWS-TWS against Travis.
>Travis: AJV L10 J.VA +28 146
>Richard_Spence: DDEGIOW 13K W.GED +20 192
#note I didn't really care about making the best play here; the board's pretty dead right now and W(A)GED doesn't open up the TWS-TWS (unlike WOG M13).
>Travis: DEELORS 14J RESOLE +46 192
#note Opponent told me he had a D left over...RESOD would've been better than RESOLE.
>Richard_Spence: DEEIMOT 15M ODE +32 224
#note Best play
>Travis: DENOV 15G DOVEN +35 227
#note A scoring error neither of us caught, it was scored as 32 instead of 35.
>Richard_Spence: CEGIIMT 9H MIC +16 240
#note Wow, MIG is 5.9 points better than MIC. Darn.
>Travis: EHP N4 PEH +32 259
>Richard_Spence: EGIIPQT O3 QI +17 257
#note Yet another board-closing play.
>Travis: BCR O7 C.RB +8 267
>Richard_Spence: EGIIPTU 15C PI +17 274
#note Quackle says exchanging all 7 sims 0.1 points higher than what I did.
>Travis: Y I6 Y. +5 272
#note I'm screwed.
>Richard_Spence: EEGIOTU L2 OUT.... +16 290
#note I play OUT(DONE) simply because I'm doomed. However it is by far the best
>Travis: IU I11 .UI +4 276
>Richard_Spence: ?EEEGIZ 5D GEEZEr +35 325
#note Lucky me
>Travis: ?FIRRST 2G gRIFT.RS +86 362
>Travis: ?FIRRST --  -86 276
#note Opponent tried gRIFT(O)RS* as an out play, which I obviously challenged. I might have tried dRIFT(O)RS*...neither of us noticed Fa(QI)R which probably would've won for Travis.
>Richard_Spence: IO 2L .I +2 327
#note Silly me, OI M1. I fail at this game.
>Travis: ?FIRRST D2 FRI.hTS +22 298
>Richard_Spence: O 4L .O.. +6 333
#note Final score, 335-275 (due to scoring error and -20 overtime). Wow...
>Richard_Spence:  (R) +2 335
