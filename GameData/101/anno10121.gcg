>Jason: BDGOUXZ 8G BUG +12 12
#note (shrugs) 500-iteration 2-ply puts seven plays within 2.7 points of each other, BUG at 8F leading the pack by about a point. Still not sure what's "right." Trying to channle my inner Nigel, hoarding the XZ in the hopes he'll set something up.
>Joe_Edley: AJY 9E JAY +28 28
>Jason: DNOOOXZ 10E OX +59 71
#note Well, he set up one...
>Joe_Edley: DEEFHT 11B HEFTED +56 84
>Jason: ADHNOOZ 12A ZONA +63 134
#note ...and then he set up the other. (So this is what being Nigel feels like!)
>Joe_Edley: EGILNRU I6 RE.LUING +64 148
>Jason: DEHILOT J1 LITHOED +72 206
#note Joe's being quite accommodating so far.
>Joe_Edley: MUV 5J .VUM +18 166
>Jason: INOSSUV M2 OVU. +18 224
#note If you can't beat 'em...
>Joe_Edley: DIW 1H WI.D +24 190
>Jason: EINRSSS A12 .INS +39 263
#note Sims a couple points behind S(U)NRISES, leads slightly in win %. CP prefers this, so yay for keeping the missed bingo count at zero!
>Joe_Edley: ?EILNOO 15A .OLENOId +74 264
>Jason: EFPRRSS 10H F.R +8 271
#note Still don't know what the play is here. Kind of liking F(O)P at 2L. Although this would work out.
>Joe_Edley: DINT 14D DINT +18 282
>Jason: AEPRRSS K8 RASPERS +75 346
>Joe_Edley: ACET -  +0 282
#note Joe held so long I was looking at my courtesy tiles when he challenged. I wasn't sure (when Joe held I thought "uh oh"), but had hope when he debated for so long and said that it would be hard for him to win if it stayed. So relieved when the challenge screen came back green.
>Jason: EIIKMPT H3 PIKI +14 360
#note Whiffed on IMP at 10A. Too obsessed with blocking up top.
>Joe_Edley: ACET 8K .EACT +24 306
>Jason: AEEMRTT M8 .MREETA +24 384
#note (C)REMATE does a better job, duh. (Although it does potentially give up QAdI at 15L.)
>Joe_Edley: ?AEGNSY O4 YEAS.iNG +65 371
#note But CREMATE does allow that. (sigh)
>Jason: AAELORT L11 ERA +20 404
>Joe_Edley: ABCIOQW N1 QI +26 397
>Jason: AELOT 10A ET +12 416
#note Four worse than TO(BY).
>Joe_Edley: ABCOW 5E WAC. +26 423
>Jason: ALO 12F LOA. +19 435
#note I lost a game to Joe at Nationals in which I definitely outdrew him but played poorly. So my first win against him felt good.
>Jason:  (BO) +8 443
