#note dont mind volatility with the X. This rack is almost so good.

#note fab sims a lot better than this. if I can get a vowel it would be a great leave.

#note 6 points seems a bit too much to pass up, but Quackle says FIX(ATE) is ever so slightly better. I may well be wrong, but I think this is a good example of not overvaluing the X. Glad I thought it through, even if I did get it wrong.

#note I thought it was likely good, but I figured it would be a very hard challenge for Jesse.

jd: damnit, I held for a couple of minutes but couldn't pull the trigger. this cost me almost 25% win percentage.

#note I really think this play is better than ORIEL and OILER, and yet this is where things went south.

#note spread doesn't matter, I just need to get the game over with 
>dacrON: AEGIIMV A7 .AVIE +30 326
#note VIGIA, but I need to conserve spread.
>Jesse_Day: ENOPPST 14N .P +8 413
#note the downside is that it allows conrad to fish, but I didn't really see anything. PUP for 15 is the best fish though.

>Jesse_Day: EHNOPST M10 HO.S +25 438
#note cbb: Right idea to block GL(A)IRY, but this is about 15 back - understandable since he had no time left.

jd: playing OH and leaving spent looks best
