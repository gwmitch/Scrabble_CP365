>Jason: ?HLMNRU 6I HM +21 37
>Jason_Keller: OX 5J OX +22 46
>Jason: ?JLNRTU 4H JUN +23 60
#note Didn't consider burning the blank to score 50+. Probably should've.
>Jason_Keller: ELORW L4 LOWER +28 74
>Jason: ?ELRRTU -LRU +0 60
#note How did I miss the bingos in this that played at 6A? That's pretty sad. I must've momentarily spaced on the -EF hook.
>Jason_Keller: LZ 7K L.Z +22 96
>Jason: ?EHPRTT 9E PHT +16 76
#note I'm more disappointed over missing PHT at 3L than I am over PHaTTER.

>Jason_Keller: AAY 8L .AYA +32 200
>Jason: DEEISTV O5 SED.TIVE +63 208
#note Given his last play, (D)IVESTED may be worth the risk.
>Jason_Keller: IIII -IIII +0 200
>Jason: BCELOTU N4 CUB +25 233
#note If I'd known I was going to draw BLUECOAT - A, I would've played DIVESTED. And BOUT, 3L. Apparently I just totally forgot LOWER had hooks.
>Jason_Keller: IIIRST 13J IRITIS +25 225
>Jason: AEGLOOT 9M GO. +26 259
>Jason_Keller: ACGIN 12C CA.ING +22 247
>Jason: ABELORT 12K OBA +22 281
#note Why'd he have to block BALLOTER with all the other places on this board to go? *sigh* LOBATE seemed silly given the vowel-heaviness of the pool, but it's Duck's pick.
>Jason_Keller: DKRU 2B DR.UK +40 287
>Jason: EILNRTT 8A LIT.. +15 296
#note It was this or GILT for me. I thought I was in better shape to bingo and LITRE gave me more options.
>Jason_Keller: AAGINOS A8 .OGANIAS +80 367
#note LOGANIAS#. It even passed through my mind that I should've held long after he drew his tiles. Problem was that my first thought was "I should've played GILT, dammit, why do I always make the wrong play when I play Keller?" when I should've been holding. I mean, I catch every break I can ask for from here and still lose. "Desperation" challenge might've been called for. But I was sure it was good. I know I've seen it before.
>Jason: AENOPRT F2 .A +6 302
#note How do I miss PRONATE fitting along row 14? I'm not sure drawing ?AVYxx wins (probably does), but still ... how do I miss that? Why did I assume that part of the board was dead?
>Jason_Keller: IQ 1A QI +36 403
#note Scored as 35.
>Jason: AENOPRT 1F OPERANT +87 389
>Jason_Keller: ADEFINO 14J FADE +41 444
>Jason: ?VY H12 .YVe +30 419
#note And Keller becomes the first player to beat me seven tournament games in a row in a microcosm of my futility against him: Missed bingos, word-knowledge errors, lousy board vision, lousy timing, and, most importantly, incredibly poor focus/attitude. Don't deserve to beat anyone playing the way I played this game.
