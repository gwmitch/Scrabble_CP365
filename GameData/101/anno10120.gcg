#note Bob couldn't make it to club tonight and Dan was busy dealing with directorial duties, so Stefan decided to be a good sport and play some Collins with me.  I gave him the cheat sheets and the list of new CSW12 words, along with free challenges and some other help along the way.  As you'll see it wasn't an entirely serious game, but it was fun and it increased Stefan's enthusiasm for CSW.
>Stefan_Fatsis: ABEIOST I3 BOATIES +78 78
#note Stefan first laid down BOATSIDE* which I challenged off, but I let him keep his turn and told him that he did have a CSW only bingo.  He quickly figured it out.

>Stefan_Fatsis: ORV 6B VOR +23 120
#note Here he laid down VAR and pressed his clock.  I mentioned that an O would work in that spot just as well as an A.  Stefan swapped the O on his rack for the A with a sly wink.

#note I complimented Stefan on his nice play and pointed out that only he had played CSW words so far.

#note Stefan hits another CSW only bingo!  He could have made it score even more with the CSW hook ZOOT.
>Dave_Koenig: ?EEOQTU B8 .EQUOTEd +127 353
#note I wasn't sure on this, but it looked familiar.  It came back good on the free challenge.

#note Didn't write the rack down, but I think I had another U and an E.  Perfect example of how the extra CSW short words can help you bail out a bad rack.
