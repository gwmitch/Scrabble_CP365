>Ryan_Fischer: ?GGLMQS G7 Q. +21 21
>Erickson_Smith: ?AINORX H8 .NOReXIA +92 104
#note 14 point difference between this and the proper placement.  So, it coulda been worse.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GGLMPS 10F GL.MP +20 41
#note Not even a hold.  I thought this was fishy, but for 8 more points than the next best play?  Yes, please.
>Erickson_Smith: EHIKOST K5 HOKIEST +117 221
#note Okay, so now challenge off your phony hook!  What?  No?  You're gonna let this go for 117?!  Okay, suit yourself!  -_-
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGPSU 13G E.PUnGES +92 133
#note Well, at least I saw this.  And EPIGEOUS.  PUGAREES was on the tip of my tongue, but couldn't quite get to this spelling.  Not that it mattered, 'cause this was so much better/more flashy.  Little consolation.
>Erickson_Smith: NNU J4 NUN +14 235
#note Aaaaand there goes the top left half of the board!  Prettty much all the top of the board is looking hopelessly out of reach at this point, actually.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEFJTUW 9C JUTE +26 159
#note N10 JEW(S) 30?  Closes two lines.  I don't like it.

#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEFRTY 12M F.Y +18 215
#note WOW: 4H FA(N)CY 51.  CHOKIEST is good!
>Erickson_Smith: ADGR D8 G.ARD +18 309
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIRTW L6 WIT +22 237
#note Still missing CHOKIEST.  Just dumping the W rates pretty high, too.  Not many places to go, though.
>Erickson_Smith: LOTV M3 VOLT +21 330
>Ryan_Fischer: AACEEOR C7 RA.A +17 254
#note Have to open up that quadrant.  Of note: ARA(BIZE).  AE(R)O is nice for balance, but accomplishes nothing for getting me back in the game.
>Erickson_Smith: EINORU 4D REUNIO. +16 346
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEOOY 3A COOEY +27 281
#note Fork the board, opening two lanes.  Pray for a miracle.
>Erickson_Smith: AAC A1 CA.A +27 373
>Ryan_Fischer: AADDEIN 1A .ANDIDAE +92 373
#note Or for a well-timed phony.  :)  He figured he could win without challenging, so he let it go.  It's close.  CANDIDA takes L and S.
>Erickson_Smith: EMORSST 5A SOREST +38 411
#note Now that's pretty amazing: he picks a move that sims almost TWICE as well as anything Static generate, winning 86% of the time, compared to 45% for (VOLT)S.  Gutsy of him to empty the bag like that, though I'm unsure if he even knows of that strategic tenent.  Champ does, however, pick 5A OMERS 38.  And it does sim even better, at about 91%.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEEFIRT 2G DRIFT +22 395
#note Best.
