>Robb_Griffith: ACEF 7G FACE +27 27
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIRSU 6J AUREI +13 39
#note Hook FACE for 20.

>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEKSU C12 KAE +30 69
#note L4 EU(R)EKA 30. :)
>Robb_Griffith: ?ABEGIN 5D BEAgING +72 123
>Robb_Griffith: ?ABEGIN --  -72 51
#note He accidentally misdesignated the blank.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEESUV H4 UVE.. +9 78
#note Champ with inference says just ignore that he has bingos and play BEAVE(R).  Yeah.
>Robb_Griffith: ?ABEGIN 11D .INGABlE +90 141
#note And this is bogus, but he has more stuff, and I kinda couldn't remember if BLEARING was the only thing there.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABESTTY M3 BYT. +18 96
#note BY, even with the two-T leave, is what Champ likes best.  This is much weaker than I thought.
>Robb_Griffith: CMOP B11 COMP +43 184
>Ryan_Fischer: AELNOST N6 .NSOLATE +60 156
#note Only.
>Robb_Griffith: AIR O7 AIR +19 203
>Ryan_Fischer: DFIIOTZ H11 .ZIDO +75 231
#note Back in it.
>Robb_Griffith: NRSTU 14J TURNS +32 235
>Ryan_Fischer: FIILTTX 12K FIX. +33 264
#note Interesting: 4G T(U)FTIL(Y).  Opens up that top left quadrant of the board, too!  Not that I need it right now.  I guess XI might be a bit better than FIX(T).

>Robb_Griffith: ELNR 9C L.NER +19 280
#note (Nice.)
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DILNOT 10K DOL. +12 292
#note 15A DO 20.  (COMPO!)
>Robb_Griffith: EJO N2 JOE +29 309
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DHINPT O3 PHT +32 324
#note Feck.  Totally missed that I could score a bingo-like play with TOPH or TOPHI!  Of course it's worth it.  That's the game.  (I was still fixating on bingoing on this crappy board.  Big mistake.)
>Robb_Griffith: AG I11 .AG +27 336
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DINSUV L9 D. +3 327
#note Champ says I3 5 UN for reasons I don't quite understand.  GUN, TUN, RUN.  He's got hooks.    VI(ED) down low seems better.  I was so low on time, just fished the D for reasons I can't explain.
>Robb_Griffith: AELQ 4F EQ.AL +14 350
>Ryan_Fischer: ?GINSUV 5C VUGS +18 345
#note Yeah, and now, the first thing I see here is UN(EQUAL).  Duh.  32 points, Champ says it's 100% to win.  I forget if I was over time yet at this point, but I would be.
