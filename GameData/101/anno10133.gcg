#note Eh... Quackle likes THEW/WHET. I wasn't a fan, as I didn't want to clog my rack up with XZ in the early game. But it sims 3 points higher.

#note VOW is better I guess? I just didn't want to draw two more consos on this board. Screw VOW, I would still do FLOWN. I don't want to drown in consos while he builds towards a bingo.

#note I guess STAID isn't a great fish. E4 DIVA sims best. C'mon Quackle, agree with some of my plays!

#note Yeesh... I was even pretty sure I was spelling this wrong. So why did I play it. PIGEON is obvious. DIPLOE is best. Bad, bad, bad play which could have cost me the game.
