#note I made this play pretty quickly, and I'm not sure why I felt like it was some important to keep scoring. On one hand, the S isn't all that useful on this board, and there's only IIUU left, but on the other hand, it just feels wrong. LOUI(E) just felt pointless given the state of the board.

#note OK now QI has to go bibi. Also, scored as 22.
>Heather_Steffy: EOTV O7 VOTE +26 344
#note She did have the Q at this point.
>dacrON: ?ANNOSU G10 AN. +20 358
#note Yes I spent 8 minutes on this endgame and made my outplay at 0 seconds and almost went over to lose the game because I had pushed my pencil led back in and was unable to designate the blank. But don't tell anyone. In fact, blocking QI with NOdUS saving AN(T) is 15 better than my play. epic.
