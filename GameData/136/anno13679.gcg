#note Tempting but risky. the T hook + open ERS really add value to this play.

>KR: ADEINTU K2 AUDIENT +78 237
#note (R)UINATED is better here. Kevin had it spelled out, but I guess opted for defense. The defense seems like an illusion to me, personally.

#note Kevin put down MU first - telegraphs a strong leave, which means he likely has a ? here.
>JAD: BEHIILU N10 HUB +35 388
#note HILI in the same spot maybe?
>KR: ?AMORSU J6 MU. +24 382
#note Tacking on the A here seems like a good idea.

#note QI(N)DAR looks like the favorite here. This is 2nd best, but those extra shots at a blank seem really helpful here, as Jesse isn't going to outrun Kevin without a blank.
>KR: ?ALOORS M11 OAR +14 429
#note I don't like this play. F7 L(O)OS keeps some pace and (C)OLORS goes for the other blank, which seems pretty crucial for Jesse's winning chances.
