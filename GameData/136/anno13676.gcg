#note Wow. Just wow. I've played flawlessly up to this point, and I get shit on like this?
>Joel_Sherman: ORSY 15L ROSY +31 245
>Winter: DEIMNNS 13A MINED +24 192
#note Dammit. Keeping the N was the right play. Quackle says keep the K, but that makes no sense to me. There's only TWO Ns in the bag, and I DRAW ANOTHER ONE???

Anyway, this rack just frustrated the hell out of me.

>Winter: AEEGLLU J3 LU.G +9 334
#note Game is pretty much over. Hail Mary. Quackle hates it of course, but a bingo is the only way to win.
>Joel_Sherman: ADEOZ C4 ADOZE +30 423
#note But with this score, I'm done.
>Winter: ABEELUX 4F LAX +39 373
#note And now I forget the S hook that I'd just set up, because I'm just so frustated that ALL SEVEN GAMES against the top players have gone to shit.
>Joel_Sherman: ?ADEIPR 2H DEsPAIR +73 496
#note That was my fault for not blocking.
