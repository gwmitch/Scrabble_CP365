#note In this position, our opponent hasonly one spot for the G: f11. We need to block this spot so we can play a trapendgame, which will be extremely lucrative. There are several ways to do this.The other tile that our opponent has is the T, so we'd also like to block HATEe8 (9), which has a residual of 4. LUV g11 (6) has a residual of 0, and eventhough it scores well it doesn't block HATE.  We must also look at the new potential of the T to block ouroptions. In this case, the T doesn't block any of our good scoring options.(KAS, DEE, OKAS, JO, NU, NUN).  However,your opponent should not play ATT right away, since you shouldn’t block it with LUV.  JO 6f (9) and DEE 14i (13) bothallow your opponent to score additional points rather than playing ATT (whichblocks LUV, but preserves NU/UP 14c for the same score). Thus, your opponentshould pass until you open one of these two spots instead of playing ATT.  However, this will only net your opponent anadditional two points (after DEET) which is not a significant enough differenceto change your score (sometimes it will be).  Thus, you should play AT, your opponent should pass, andshould pass until you play DEE.  Your opponent should then play DEET, and you’ll make your other 6 plays and win thegame by the score 428-367.
