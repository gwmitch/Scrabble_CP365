#note By all means, miss the good play, why doesn't she. If she's going to draw like a luckbox, what does it matter?

#note Quackle likes ER? On a board where QI doesn't even play???
>Robin_Laprelle: ?LNPSTX 3F eXPL.NTS +100 237
#note Okay that's a good play, but still luckier than me.
>Winter: ?EGHINR 2B NEIGH +46 154
#note Not knowing (O)cHERING (notice the difference between that and CARNIES), 46 for NEIGH seems way better than a weak bino.
>Robin_Laprelle: DIQU C2 .QUID +30 267
#note YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE FUCKING Q I THREW BACK IN!!!
>Winter: ?DRRSUZ -DURZ +0 154
#note This is so much bullshit. I CAN'T EVEN PLAY A FUCKING Z!!!
>Robin_Laprelle: GMU A13 MUG +26 293
>Winter: ?EIIRSY H1 YI. +24 178
#note I hate this bullshit. She's already bingoed twice, and I get this shit???
>Robin_Laprelle: KLN 4B L.NK +16 309
#note OH... MY.... GOD!!! TWO Fs, a C, and two esses in the bag (or on her rack), AND SHE FUCKING GIVES UP A 50-POINT PLAY???

WHY IS SUCK NOT PUNISHED???
>Winter: ?DEIIRS L5 DaIRIES +65 243
#note It would be too much to ask to have a play beginning in S, wouldn't it.
>Robin_Laprelle: OTW A8 WOT +24 333
>Winter: ACDEIOO A4 COO +22 265
#note If she had not had that fucking T, I would have slammed her with COOED, but of course everything in this game is shit for me.
>Robin_Laprelle: AEELNOS 11G ENOLA.ES +66 399
#note Unbelievable.
>Winter: AADEIIN H11 .AIAD +21 286
>Robin_Laprelle: BFFU J10 B.UFF +27 426
#note Nope, she didn't have the esses when she played LUNK. She just sucks.
>Winter: AEHINOZ 8L .AZE +39 325
#note Wow. I actually mistrack and think she has a D, and I'm sure she'll get the bingo. It's actually a P, but even that yields a bingo, so I have to block to save my spread.
