#note Time-consuming turn with a blank on each of our racks. I can't bingo, so I decided to block all his. I was already running low on time, but I think I would have eventually settled on 71 OAR if I had found it in time. It's definitely better

#note I've studied a decent amount of sixes, but haven't gotten that far yet. I just didn't want to risk allowing a phony here. This mistake is going to cost me 25% of a win, but I'm still in ok shape.

#note Can't be too annoyed at my major blunder, since it's just a word outside my range. But still, I hate having a range.
