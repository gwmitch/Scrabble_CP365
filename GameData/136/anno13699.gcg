>Jesse_D: AEEMOOW 8G WOO +12 12
#note jd: WOE is noticeably better since EO and EE are close and WOO takes so many hooks
>E_Tran: ?EIIIMO 9G OI +11 11
#note et: I like the defense of this play.  After I bingo, it'll be tougher for him to make a comeback
>Jesse_D: AAEMUVW 10C MAUVE +24 36
>E_Tran: ?EIIMRU C3 IMpERIU. +76 87
#note et: Played this fairly quickly (trying to fastplay Jesse).  Urinemia is better for defense, but I didn't spot it, and I think the quickplay factor is worth the tradeoff.
>Jesse_D: AADEHIW D1 WADI +35 71
#note jd: AAHED scores a ton of points but WI is pretty bad. still better than my play
>E_Tran: ?ACQSSX E9 S.Q +24 111
>Jesse_D: AEEGHTV 1D .EAVE +33 104
#note jd: kind of a weird play but it beats GAVE at E4 on a sim. I figured I'd be fine as long as I drew a vowel and could hit B6 next turn
>E_Tran: ?AACSXY 12B CAYS +31 142
#note et: 8A AX(I)S is more points, and it bingos 46% next turn, compared to 20% after CAYS.   I over-estimated how bad ACY? was.  It's decent for bingoing, it turns out.  
>Jesse_D: AAGHNTT B6 HAT +31 135
>E_Tran: ?ABCDLX J6 CALX +26 168
#note et: It costs me 7 points instead of playing at E4.  But I wanted the board to be more closed.  I expect to bingo very soon, and want the board gross for him to make a comeback.  Maybe being a bit too defensive.  Again, I was trying to play quick though, so didn't take a lot of time to decide.
>Jesse_D: AGJLNOT 7I J.G +36 171
#note jd: I like it when people try to fast-play me
>E_Tran: ?BDFGIU 2H FUB +19 187
#note et: Again, sacrificing 3 points here for added defense.  After taking out the 2-line, there's not many places for him to play and score well.
>Jesse_D: ALNNOTT 3I TALON +19 190
#note jd: I didn't want the E hook so TALON instead of TOLAN, but quackle actually thinks NOTAL sims best, probably because it prevents 4-tile overlaps at 4H or something. maybe if I'd realized how defensively eric was play I would've tried to open more?
>E_Tran: ?DEGGIO L5 DOGGIEr +74 261
#note et: Almost chickened out on DOGGIER, and went with DOGGIES.  But I had to go with my gut; and if I chickened out, he might have a chance at DOGGIEST.
>Jesse_D: NNOORST 13C NO +13 203
>E_Tran: DEILPST A4 PIT +14 275
#note et: NO signals a really strong rack for Jesse.  I want to force him to bingo at 14 or N, and give me a shot at an x3: so, any plays at 14 or 2 look bad.  Sim likes E4 DIP for pts/leave.  I tried to block the A line for bingoes, just in case he had an -ST bingo.  That's a little too paranoid, and I'm more likely to score a 6 in that spot, really. jd: I was pretty happy when I saw him burn points to play here.
>Jesse_D: EINORST N1 OESTRIN +74 277
>E_Tran: DEEFLRS 1L FE.D +36 311
#note et: FLOE and FROE are better.  I guess the D is really good on this board.  Bingo% for FLOE / FROE / FEOD: 22% / 34% / 28%.
>Jesse_D: EEHILPR K10 HELP +25 302
#note jd: I figured I would give eric something else to worry about and try to get myself another way back into the game besides just outdrawing eric.
>E_Tran: AEELRRS 13G RELA.SER +74 385
#note jd: nice find by eric
>Jesse_D: ABEINRZ H12 Z.IN +69 371
#note jd: I was pretty sure I had eric beat as long as he didn't bingo last turn. well, now I was still kind of in striking range. ZEIN creates a new lane and gives me a much better shot at coming back.
>E_Tran: DIKORTY O6 DORKY +44 429
#note et: Saw the possibilities of UNBEATEN and BANNERET.  Was worried he could outrun me if I made a bad blocking play.  Instead, I just conceded the win if he had those, and went for a big scoring play.  Champ says I should try to block, with 14D KID to block BANNERET.  I had a lot of time left, but couldn't pull the trigger on it.  My play does give him some huge B-plays though, which makes it unfavorable.
>Jesse_D: ABENRTU -  +0 371
#note jd: I challenged since I was up on the field on spread by a lot and it was my only way of winning.
>E_Tran: EINT 14B TINE +17 446
>E_Tran:  (ABENRTU) +18 464
