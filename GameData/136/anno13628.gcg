#note interesting move here. ZOA and ZEAL sim at the top, but ZOA sims a little better. i didn't want to be in a closed board situation even though i'm barely down and it's this early in the game. ZOA has a significantly better bingo percentage though. (-0.5)

#note i know that i'm probably wrong, but my thought here was that YO/YE 7C close up the board too much and now i'm down by a not insignificant amount. i think i'm not gauging stuff properly. DYE is also giving up cheap points. how wrong am i? (-9.5)

#note N2 GOD is the obvious play. at the very least i have COT if it doesn't work out. COG is too inflexible of a leave. (-5.5)
