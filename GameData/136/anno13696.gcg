#note Ok. So. He does a count. When he takes his hand out, I can't see his palm, so naturally, I ask him to open his hand. He does so, but with an arrogant tone of voice and very reluctant at first. Granted, he did not have any tiles in his hand, but in the last turn of this game, I'll include what he told me about this action.

#note So. After the game, he tells me, "You know, you really shouldn't be asking people ranked higher than you to open their hands after counting. We're more experienced than people like you, so we're not going to be cheating. You're just a 1300-rated player from the Midwest, I'm better than you. Don't be questioning me or people will start not liking you." 

Well. The fact of the matter is, where in NASPA's rulebook does it say I'm not allowed to ask him to open his palm to make sure he's not cheating? Does rating affect this right? It doesn't. And Midwest? That has NOTHING to do with this. I'm quite appalled at his actions, and so were the other competitors.
