#note I might burn the ammo for 50+, but less than 50 with the V leftover.... nah....
>Wendy_McGrath: OOZ J6 ZOO +39 39

#note Now's not the time for silliness, Matt.
>Wendy_McGrath: AAS A1 A.A +12 159
>Matthew_Larocque: AFGNNRY 3C NAG +20 167
#note A real stinker of a decision on my part. I'm thinking *KAFF is actually valid, but is that really a good reason to play NAG over FAG? Take the sure points! Or play (P)ANFRY but I'm not cool enough for that.
>Wendy_McGrath: ASS N1 AS +26 185
#note Plus you never know when your opponent is overflowing with esses.

>Wendy_McGrath: CEISU 12I CU.IE +14 258
>Matthew_Larocque: DEORSTT 14J D.ORS +29 313
#note I think it's correct to abandon bingoing on this board.

#note Saving DEITY for next turn if it doesn't get blocked. Whatever I do, I can't let her bingo out.
>Wendy_McGrath: ?EGILRS 14B GRIStLE +66 353
#note Which would have happened.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIRTVY 8A DEITY +39 394

>Wendy_McGrath:  (RV) +10 368
#note -10. Glad I was able to keep my cool and realise that playing DEITY right away could have been fatal with my time penalty.
