>Curran_Eggertson: ACV 8G VAC +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: EILRSTV H7 V.STLIER +62 62
#note Since Curran is opening with VAC I figure I'm at liberty to try a stupid phony.
>Curran_Eggertson: ?BEGNOU 11G B.UdGEON +70 86
#note Curran likes it, and besides, he gets to bingo back for even more. Although a slight bit chancy.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIQRUW L8 QUE.R +48 110
#note One day I'll rememeber QUAERE.
>Curran_Eggertson: DIU 8L .UID +42 128
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIOOW K6 WOE +21 131
#note Barf. As much as it killed me, I just got worried about the easy points he could get here. I didn't know WOO(D)IE, but I did think about OO(R)IE which sim likes better than WOE.
>Curran_Eggertson: AEEISTT 14G A.IETTES +70 198
#note Clearly I made the wrong choice.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINOP 15A EPINAOI +82 213
#note As if!
>Curran_Eggertson: DGI 13M DIG +18 216
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAKLUY 14A YUK +39 252
>Curran_Eggertson: EEGILNO O1 ELOIGNE. +83 299
#note No mercy in this game.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AACLRZ 3M AZ. +24 276
#note This was tough but I didn't see anything else - I gotta open and the Z won't let me bingo.
>Curran_Eggertson: EF N1 FE. +39 338
#note :(
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACFLOR 10F CA. +15 291
#note Let's see if this works....
>Curran_Eggertson: LNT I11 .NL.T +11 349
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DFHLOR M7 D.H +22 313
#note Nope.
>Curran_Eggertson: AHS 13A AHS +40 389
#note :(
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DFLOPR -  +0 313
#note Now I'm just starting to lose my sanity. I had a flashback to someone playing *GUP on me and I didn't pay attention enough to challenge. So Curran is about to draw his letters and and I get confused thinking HUP was like the time I let *GUP go... or something....or maybe I was just trying to help Curran achieve a new personal record. Yeah let's just say that.
>Curran_Eggertson: NOW J5 WON +17 406

>Curran_Eggertson: JOY 4K JOY +31 437
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDER 2K REB.. +15 354
#note Didn't get the rack but it might have been something like BDEIMR?, nothing that would end in S, so I make a stupid play to open the TWS.
>Curran_Eggertson: AAIMNRT 1F MARTIAN +85 522
#note You're welcome Curran!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADIMRR 2B zIRAM +36 390
#note Yes I actually missed those, but I'm not even trying anymore. But now I know MIRADOR is a word.
>Curran_Eggertson: EOSTX 3C SEX +35 557
>Matthew_Larocque: DR 5H D.. +7 397
#note Curran asked me after if DR(OW) was a word. I probably could have used it to go out! (RE)D is 8.
>Curran_Eggertson: OT 1C TO +10 567
>Curran_Eggertson:  (R) +2 569
#note -20. Kinda dropped the ball in a few places, Curran was all over this game.
