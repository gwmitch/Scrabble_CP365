#note This isn't part of my endgame series.  I'm just posting it because it was a fun game.  Also posted because it's an example of a trend in my playing style.

#note I considered 9F OLEA, but I didn't like the hotspot it gives up.

>Tasha: DELLNRS 12J D.LL +10 41
#note I forgot to write my leave here, but I wrote  DELLNORS on the bottom of my score sheet.  I also remember thinking of LANDLERS.  Anyways, there's no bingo through the O, and my play is best.

#note I'll give anything for a P right now.

#note There's my damn P.  Quackle says I'm a sorry excuse for a Scrabble player and takes off about 12 points.  If I had to do it all over again, I'll play JOB, which I strongly considered.  I saw 11D JAB (sim winner), but that gives up too much if he has an O.  I think I was trying to take out a lane while dumping high pointers.  I can always use the J next turn.

#note Thank goodness he didn't have a blank or an S.

>Tasha: EEENNRU 9D RUNE +11 250
#note I took forever this turn.  I almost played ENURE, but changed my mind.  I wish I would have played it.  D7 REUNITE sims best.  But Quackle is discouraging because it's telling me "Girl, it doesn't matter if you play REUNITE, ENURE, or RUNE.  You're gonna lose this game, baby!"  I'm at less than 10% to win.

#note I'm annoyed because I now know the other blank is in the bag and I failed to draw it.  I suck.  In other news, Andrew said he didn't have the blank until after playing TOTE.  It's always an interesting game when the blanks pop up late because both players spend the game thinking the other has both blanks on their racks (which is what happened).

#note I'm starting to notice a disturbing trend in my playing style.  Judging from the my game against Susan Love, my game against Al Helfgott ("the bimboing on JOULES game") and my loss against Daiva Markelis in the Thanksgiving Elmhurst tourney, I can't seem to steal games from the clutches of sure defeat.  It's disturbing because in most cases, I KNOW what play will give me the best chance to win, but I just don't make the play for whatever reason.  I'll play it safe instead of taking the risk.  Although  I think it's wrong to needlessly make plays that WILL give you a chance to win, but will almost certainly be blocked by your opponent, I think it's also wrong to not give yourself the best chance at winning at all times.  Decisions, decisions.  There must be a better way to go about this...
