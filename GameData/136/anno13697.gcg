>Avery_Mojica: EJKNRTZ I9 NERTZ +28 28
#note I debated between JUNK and this. JUNK is quite a bit better.
>Matthew_Ridout: ILNNORU I1 LINURON +64 72
>Avery_Mojica: AIJKPQX H2 PAX +43 71
#note I love these draws.

#note He's just feeding me now.

#note I don't like KO(B)S

>Avery_Mojica: BCDEKOS G1 DEB +26 179
#note After being engaged in conversation with Matt, I got distracted and forgot about 12L. askdjfalvzaspdfjaapwfjowae darn it - this is a suboptimal play but makes it onto the top 15
>Matthew_Ridout: CDEI K5 CEDI +25 173
>Avery_Mojica: AGKORSY 12K OKAY +38 217

#note terrible
>Matthew_Ridout: GI 12D GI. +12 204
>Avery_Mojica: AEIMORS 14J MA +23 260
#note I didn't want to burn the S, but maybe it wouldn't have counted as burning for all the extra points...
>Matthew_Ridout: EILNR 15K LINER +22 226
>Avery_Mojica: EHIOORS M9 HO +24 284
#note Best
>Matthew_Ridout: DEVW E11 W.VED +42 268
>Avery_Mojica: EEIOORS D14 OE +9 293
#note Briefly considered OROIDE, but I need a bingo in order to win this pretty much, especially with the risky blanks still out - scored as 10
>Matthew_Ridout: AY 6N YA +18 286
#note Setting up an R?
>Avery_Mojica: DEIOORS L6 DO +9 302
#note This is not a bad play - I felt like blocking off the possible R hook while it's open - this also confirms he has either the R or a blank.
>Matthew_Ridout: TU C13 UT +7 293
>Avery_Mojica: EIORRSV -VOR +0 302
#note Didn't think of IVORY. I don't have a chance with this R or V anymore - I think exchanging is suboptimal to IVORY but still an option
>Matthew_Ridout: ??AEHST B7 SHEiTAn +59 352
#note Quackle suggests holding off on bingoing until a few turns later, such as AH 14M. This is the only legit bingo space left, unless you are smart enough to find cATHEpS(IN) 7A.

#note GALOPED 6F is cool

#note whoa (P)RE(ED)ITS 15A lol
>Matthew_Ridout: AORSV C4 ARVO +11 384
#note No SAVORY for you :)
>Avery_Mojica: ES C9 ES +11 372
#note grrrrr why do i forget SEPIC - would have brought me within 2 points of winning - tracking shows i am at 362
