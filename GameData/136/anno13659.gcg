>Don_Drumm: EFGINNR 8D FINGER +28 28
#note This was a fun game so I felt like putting on. FINGER is best here, although fishing with it is in interesting option.
>Matthew_O'Connor: AAHNORS 7G AHA +20 20
#note This is also best.
>Don_Drumm: IO 7C OI +8 36
#note I only knew his first rack, so the rest don't show up.
>Matthew_O'Connor: ENORSTY H7 ..Y +9 29
#note I can score, I can balance, and I can fish. These positions seem to show up often, and I usually choose the scoriny option, but STONER is really good, so I fished. CP seems to prefer OY 9G.
>Don_Drumm: NOTW 6H TOWN +28 64
>Matthew_O'Connor: EFNORST D7 ..F +9 38
#note Drew a bingo, but not a playable one. The only scoring options use the whole rack, and still have me losing by 1. (IF)F is best.
>Don_Drumm: DEIX K5 I.DEX +26 90
>Matthew_O'Connor: ENORSTT 5K .T +2 40
#note Still not a playable bingo. I tried to set up my S with (I)T, but CP doesn't like it too terrible much.
>Don_Drumm: JTU 6D JUT +29 119
>Matthew_O'Connor: EINORST L7 ORIENTS +81 121
#note There we go.
>Don_Drumm: BOY 10D YOB +35 154
>Matthew_O'Connor: DIIOSVZ 11J ZI. +24 145
#note Interesting position here. SOZI(N) scores the best, but uses the S. ZI(N) is the best scoring play without using the S. CP prefers (B)OVID.
>Don_Drumm: ALNP 12H PLAN. +23 177
>Matthew_O'Connor: DIOOPSV H12 .OOP +24 169
#note PIVO(T) is an option, but it sets up the triple pretty well. I like (P)OOP the best despite seeing CP's options.
>Don_Drumm: DGI 11E DIG +20 197
>Matthew_O'Connor: DHIIOSV 12A VOIDS +30 199
#note This looks right. If so, I missed SHIV, but this is 3rd. DIVO(T) is entropic and CP's favorite.
>Don_Drumm: AEMU A9 MAU.E +10 207
>Matthew_O'Connor: EHIQ B9 EH +30 229
#note This sims best with a partial rack sim, don't remember the last 3 letters.
>Don_Drumm: O 9G O. +11 218
#note uhoh
>Matthew_O'Connor: EE I12 .EE +9 238
#note Forget the rack...
>Don_Drumm: C 11J ...C +15 233
>Matthew_O'Connor: ADEEILQ L3 QA. +24 262
#note I think this was it, no question here.

>Don_Drumm: ?AEEIRS N6 AERIESt +76 309
>Matthew_O'Connor: BDEEILU O5 BIDE +32 294
#note Missing EDIBLE in 2 spots
>Don_Drumm: CKM C11 M.CK +24 333
>Matthew_O'Connor: ?AELUUW 3K E.UAL +28 322
#note WU? is not too terribly attractive, but there's not much else I can do here. Perhaps (Q)UA.
>Don_Drumm: NR M2 R.N +5 338
#note Dodged a bullet here.

>Matthew_O'Connor: ?EGLTUW 15A WEsT +33 355
#note WEsT doesn't show up on CP because it starts too low on speedy's radar. This or GUsT look best though.
>Don_Drumm: AALNRRT 13G R.. +4 342
>Matthew_O'Connor: GLSUV O1 GU. +12 367
>Don_Drumm: AALNRT O12 ANAL +17 359
#note (DO)T(ED) ties
>Matthew_O'Connor: LSV J11 ..S +16 383
#note Playing it save in case he can go out (he can't)
>Don_Drumm: RT O5 ....T +10 369
#note (DO)T(ED) is still better.
