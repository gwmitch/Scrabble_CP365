>ravens_key_fob: EIIKLMN 8D KILIM +32 32
#note Quick switch to CSW. That's how we roll at the TSC. And if you can't KILIM, join 'em.
>yon_lathe: IIORT 9G TORII +14 14
>ravens_key_fob: ?DDDENR E2 uNDERD.D +70 102
#note Only this and DENDRO(I)D plays.

>yon_lathe: OY J5 OY +30 58
>ravens_key_fob: AEEIIVV L2 VIAE +19 161
#note Either KIEVE# or KEAVIE# are improvements but I'm not familiar with them. At least VIAE# undoubles the rack and retains a consonant.
>yon_lathe: EPRW 8K .WERP +42 100
>ravens_key_fob: CEIJPTV 2D J.PE +37 198
#note After counting and recounting this play, still came up with 29. The brain often works in ridiculous ways.
>yon_lathe: EEMOSST N4 SOME.SET +68 168
>ravens_key_fob: ABCGITV O1 VAGI +30 228
#note VIVAT# scores eight more but yields an uglier leave.  Had I seen (K)ITBAG, I may have opted for it.
>yon_lathe: AEH 4B HAE. +41 209
#note The thought of THAED* came into my head. You know, because it's CSW and virtually anything can be a word.
>ravens_key_fob: BCNNQTU 3J QU.N +26 254
#note Oh, dear lord. Stupid QU-followed-by-a-consonant words that score 26 more ON THE EXACT SAME ROW.
>yon_lathe: AGNW 1G WANG +29 238
#note WANG# - (n) the cheek.  Yeah, sure. Try again.
>ravens_key_fob: ABCENRT O11 ACERB +38 292
#note "That one stings," exclaimed my opponent. The comedy never stops. Guess that's no surprise since we're actually at a club.
>yon_lathe: ANUU M11 UNAU +11 249

#note The Duck abides.
>yon_lathe: LO 2L .OL. +16 313
>ravens_key_fob: ?DELNTT C3 ..LD +8 362
#note Silly superfluous consonants. Sure, why not create another lane with a lead and a rather friendly unseen tile pool?
>yon_lathe: AFR 14J FRA. +15 328
>ravens_key_fob: ?ENOSTT J13 O. +5 367
#note Guess SNOTTIE# (76) should've been the option. But holding the last two Ts and the case blank, why not make it interesting? (And also impossible for him to bingo big with ACEROLA/CALORIE/CARIOLE/OLEARIA# on the bottom row.)
>yon_lathe: AACEILR K14 .E +2 330
#note I believe this is what he had. At least I sort of remembering no bingo existing on his rack.
>ravens_key_fob: ?EINSTT 15E dINETT.S +83 450
#note mINETT(E)S# and TrIENT(E)S also yield maximum value.
>ravens_key_fob:  (AACILOR) +18 468
#note In the end, I don't think this particular contest will convince anyone to switch to CSW. But still you have to admit the added hook options make the game more interesting.
