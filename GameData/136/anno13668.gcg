#note IGG 13C is worth considering, mainly because it blocks a scoring opportunity.

#note OX 12G gives us strong opportunities next turn. It may be a bit better than this.

#note Tough call here. We draw unblockable bingos around 60% of the time, and there's no reason to assume opp has a particularly strong rack...it seems worth the gamble here. The pool also isn't so great for drawing 5 new tiles.

#note We missed 13K AIOLI here, whch is a great play. This one seems good, holding the blank.

#note this seems to balance the leave best, open another powerful lane, and preserve the onces we already have.

>dacrON: BEEEHIT 1N EH +17 419
#note There are actually only 5 bingos on column O, while playing EH gives the opponent a whole slew of good fishing opportunities. Emptying the bag looks good here. THEINE is the highest scoring play that does this, but it doesn't appear to beat any bingos. EITHER 15C blocks a few more bingos and keeps enough of a lead to outrun nonbingo racks.
