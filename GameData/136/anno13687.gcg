#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures - Episode 6.  It is correct to sacrifice four points to place this at 8D instead of 8H. :D

#note Okay, pre-endgame.  I had about eight minutes on my clock.  Right spot, wrong word.  EAU is much better.

#note Marty is giving me too much credit here.  He took a long time on this play because he was trying to find a way to block UNHEEDED.  When he told me this after the game, I told on myself by exclaiming, "That's a word?" or some such thing. And my next play should come with a disclaimer.  Like "May cause face palming, excessive laughter, or disappointed sighing."  Or "Do not view if pregant."

#note NoooOOOoooOOOooooOOOOoooOOO!!!!!!  I especially like how I played the right letters in "almost" the right spot.  Very reminiscent of 2L ANI.
>Marty: EINT D11 E.INT +8 426
#note I mistracked him.  Although I tracked CORRECTLY, I wrote his rack down INcorrectly.  I had him tracked at EINU.

#note ...... Okay, I'm not going to give up.  ...this is just a minor setback.  ...Yeah, that's it.  LATENCY instead of VALENCY was a major mistake, but even with the triple-triple, I still could have won.  Never mind EDH.  Not seeing EAU is what ultimately cost me the game.  Getting the preendgame right is important!  Getting the tracking right is important!
