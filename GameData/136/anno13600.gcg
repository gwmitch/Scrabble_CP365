>GGS: IWZ 8G WIZ +30 30
#note Battle of the 1975-plus ratings at the Toronto Club. Now there's something you don't hear often.  My opponent likes to repeat the fact how he's never beaten me in a tournament or club game. Hey, whatever gets you motivated, son.
>ETB: AFIINTU I6 FI. +16 16
#note FI(Z) and FAIN (25) run close in the sim results, although why give the opponent more to work with when the reward difference is minimal?
>GGS: AEKY 6I .AKEY +17 47
>ETB: AINORTU K6 .ORUNA +20 36
#note I was looking for something that scored at least double-digits, kept a good leave, and didn't blow up the board.  AU(K) probably optimizes all three criteria.
>GGS: ?ADIMOT L9 MAsTOID +79 126
#note He wasn't totally sure of MATtOID for the extra point or KORUNA taking the S for three more (I wasn't also certain, for that matter). Bonus marks if you found TOAD(Y)ISm.
>ETB: ?DDIQTU 13J QU.D +28 64
#note I actually thought of QUIDD(I)Ty before his bingo but thought I was making it up.
>GGS: EORSV N10 VERSO +47 173
>ETB: ?DEEINT 15E InDENTE. +77 141
#note If you're gonna be lazy about finding the best bingo (nothing scores more than 77), then make sure you don't set up a future QAT play that could possibly decide the game.
>GGS: ABL J9 BAL +21 194
>ETB: AEHILNS 9B INHALES +70 211
>GGS: JLOT M2 JOLT. +30 224
>ETB: EGGIIPW 7B PIGGIE +19 230
#note Like hell I'm going with WIGG(L)E.  You try that Quackle, and see where that takes you.
>GGS: FOX N1 FOX +53 277
>ETB: CGNORUW O2 WOG +32 262
#note To play or not to play the extra consonant: that is the question. GOWN is 33 but the N works fine with the CRU combo.
>GGS: HOT 8A THO +29 306
>ETB: CMNPRRU 14B RUMP +20 282
#note Scored as 22. Adding the C sheds another consonant but may work well later...if I can convince myself that the word exists in TWL.
>GGS: RVY E7 .R.VY +24 330
>ETB: ACINRSU 4H UNCIA. +18 300
#note C, F, G, T. Remember those hooks, kids; they may save your life someday. Although UNCIA(L) does create two new bingo lines.
>GGS: ACEN 13A CANE +22 352
#note Well, at least I'm not the only one who is confused about that hook.
>ETB: ADEERST 5B DERATES +68 368
#note Probably the best draw I could've hoped for.  But this one is far from being decided...
>GGS: ABEILOR 4A BORAL +31 383
#note He spent a long time before ultimately deciding on the word scoring the most and using the most letters.  Unfortunately, BORAL has its shortcomings...
>ETB: EENST O11 NE +8 376
#note ...since he only has one outplay, which I have to block due to my inability to go out first.
>GGS: EI 12L .I.. +7 390
#note Even in time trouble, this is the best he could do.
>ETB: EST 3B SET +19 395
#note Game, SET, and match. FAKEYS* is phony, no matter what dictionary you use.
>ETB:  (E) +2 397
#note Final score: 399-390 (Get ready for my subsequent club match, which used the mysterious and magical CSW lexicon.)
