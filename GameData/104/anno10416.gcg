#note tough move, this is the best I could see though DUCAT 
>Leesa_Berahovich: KLPU 11A PLU.K +22 44
>jd: ACEFFRT 7G AFFECT +29 79
#note with no spot for affecter I settled for this weaker play instead of just play AFF. while CERT is not that strong in this pool and on this board, AFFECT opens too much for her.

#note lucky draw, ANCESTOR is a better play. why could I not find ancestor??

#note did not spot hexones, but this sims better

>jd: ADEHOSU C3 HO +22 228
#note I saw all the relevant plays here (HO HOD or OHS) and settled for this one. they all sim vey close although HOD seems to pull ahead.

>jd: AGIIORV 1D AGIO +9 444
#note I considered just playing vigia at O4 as I was going to originally but figured I could do something to lessen the score of her bingo. this is alright, but if I'm making a play like this OI at 1D should be better.

#note this is way worse than just playing JIVE at O12, which I somehow didn't spot.
