#note Derp. I just flat-out missed BEAMY. Other sweet options are MAYWEED 13G and DWEEBY 13H. BEADY isn't bad, but BEAMY is the play. MW is meh.

#note I had a hard time deciding between this and L12 MEWL. UW is of course bad, but AGU isn't too hot either. In doubt, I took the two extra points. Discussing the position after the game, Ross came up with a play I hadn't considered: L12 MEW setting up the L. It's cute. I don't think I would have tried it, but Quackle likes it a hair better than GLEAM. But MEWL sims a hair better than MEW. The three plays are within a point and a half. UW really is shit.

#note I strongly considered 15G ULU to set up my L or blank S. But I really didn't think the meagre setup was worth keeping IULT?. I thought keeping a U killed my bingo chances. But sure enough, the sim shows ULU results in my bingoing a full 10% more often than with ex UUU. Really, do I actually bingo 73% of the time after ULU? I mean, where the hell is Ross going to play on this board? To the Y, most likely, but something to the E or R is likely too, negating the ULU setup. It's only about a 2.5 point equity difference after simming, but I'm still in disbelief that ULU bingos so often. Enlighten me?

#note Ross will usually play pretty blockily after a perceived fish. But I was hoping he wouldn't infer a bingo leave from this play, since it was 27 pts after all.

#note Lucky to get a good letter. The sim actually prefers RITZ. But I don't know. I feel like if I don't bingo now, I'll be sitting on this blank all game. I realise I'm giving a lot back. On an a more open board, I would consider RITZ. On theory, I'll get to hit the Z next turn.

#note Sim says I should take the points for WIRIER. I guess I can't disagree with Quackle every turn. But man... AUU?

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ABIORRV 13B VAR +18 290
#note Fail. My justification for this play was to block SNAGGER*. VIRAGO is the nonidiot's play.

#note I preferred this to REBOZO. It was probably the right call, but hindsight's a bitch.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: IIMRSSW N1 WIS +17 341
#note Quackle agrees I need to block the Q. But the best play is apparently N2 ISM. I didn't consider any play which set up an S-hook into the O column, but maybe setting up that spot is my best chance to win? There's also that J-ISM setup. Jeez, this was a tough position. I fail at pre-endgame.
