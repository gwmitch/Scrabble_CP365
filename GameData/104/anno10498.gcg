>Jim_Burlant: AJRRTVZ 7I JAR +35 35
#note Tempted to make a higher turnover play (e.g.:  I5 RAZOR), but realized that this both scored too much and potentially set up the Z to do anything else.  This is best, nothing else remotely worth consideration.
>Darrell_Day: ADEFMO 6J FOAMED +37 59
>Jim_Burlant: DGRRTVZ -DGRV +0 35
#note And yet again, my rack is a pile of dung and I can't take advantage of what he's given me.  A little surprised that Q also wants me to throw the Z back in.  I felt there were enough spots to score with the Z that it was worth keeping.  Q wants me to just keep RT.
>Darrell_Day: INOW O4 IN.OW +30 89
>Jim_Burlant: ACEQRTZ N2 QAT +26 61
#note Oh, to have had this rack one turn ago.  It actually takes the sim a few hundred iterations to sort out and declare this best; best play statically is to exchange QZ, which I considered but I couldn't turn down the 26 points.  30% to win.
>Darrell_Day: APV K3 VAP.. +20 109
>Jim_Burlant: AACEERZ E8 .AZE +26 87
#note Q prefers E5 ZEAL by  0.7% and 2 points.  This is the bronze medalist  due to the easy back hooks it offers.  Silver medalist is D3 ZAREEBA.   I'm 34% to win.   I chose this to make it more difficult for Darrell to tighten the board.  
>Darrell_Day: ILR L4 RI.L +27 136
>Jim_Burlant: ACEEGMR 7C MAG +28 115
#note Or REGLAZE.  Either play is as strong as the other in the sim's eyes (REGLAZE wins 0.05% more often in the 2-ply sim), though this one sims with 1 point less valuation at 1200 2-ply iterations.
>Darrell_Day: IX O1 XI +38 174
>Jim_Burlant: CEEINOR G5 NEO.ERIC +62 177
#note The only bingos that play are G4 ERECTION and this choice.  I deliberately chose this because I didn't like the putting the E at G4 with DDDFHH still unseen, especially if he had CLEF, OATH, etc. in his rack.  The sim disagrees, saying that ERECTION wins 39.9%, and ERECTION wins 41-1/2 at 1200+ 2-ply iterations.
>Darrell_Day: BIO 9I BIO +23 197
>Jim_Burlant: EGGIRTU H1 GIGUE +26 203
#note I thought there might be an 8 in ths, but a check of Zyzzyva shows that the only 8 in this rack is EGGRFUIT.  This is a strong choice, but not best - TUGGER scores 34 and GURGE, which sims identically to this, scores 29.  Still only 42% to win; not losing ground, but not gaining, either.
>Darrell_Day: AEENTU 12G .UNEATE +20 217
>Jim_Burlant: CFORTUW 10J FROW +33 236
#note Strong choice, but once again not best - CURFEW scores 30 and unloads the U.  Q doesn't dock me much, but the lack of curfew and lack of the S hook for row 14 loom large later in this game.
>Darrell_Day: ADDHILS 13B LADDISH +93 310
#note Nice fit and the only bingo.  Now I'm in trouble - Darrell is 85% to win, even with both blanks unseen to him.
>Jim_Burlant: CPSTTUY 10B YUT. +24 260
#note This is my highest scoring option, and the sim indicates it's a solid choice, but once again it's not best.  6B CUT and B10 SCULPT are the plays.  The board may have to take precedence over my rack and I may have to hold the Y just to create more diversions for him to defend.  No matter how you look at it, though, this is bleak.  Best play doesn't even win 7-1/2%.  This wins just under 6.
>Darrell_Day: EV 2G V.E +6 316
>Jim_Burlant: CEKNPST M10 .E.K +22 282
#note The idea was to set up an S hook and cross my fingers that any block he put down would open up row 15.  Problem is that I needed to turn more of this consonant overloaded rack.  6B PEC was the play.  I get it on the next turn.  PEC wins 11%.  This treads water, winning just under 6. Maybe if I play CURFEW instead of FROW a few turns back, I can do something better with this rack and not be so consonant heavy?
>Darrell_Day: HI 12C HI +21 337
>Jim_Burlant: CENPSST 6B PEC +24 306
#note Q's #1 choice is  just to fish with PES 6F, but that may fare better against Quackle than Darrell.  He's sure to underlap CUNEATE with something like LIKE or DIKE or YOK on row 13 if I don't open another line.  This actually increases my winning chances to 15%.  In retrospect I probably should have played SPEC, not PEC.
>Darrell_Day: ELRRSU A1 RULERS +29 366
#note I don't know what his 7th tile was, but even if it was the blank, none of the 7's would play.  But as you'll see shortly, SLUR A6 may have been better than this.  Regardless, it's important to note that this makes clear at least one blank is unseen to Darrell - maybe both.  
>Jim_Burlant: AINNSST 14A NITS +22 328
#note So close,  yet so far.  While SPEC should have been the play on my last turn, PEC unintentionally lured Darrell into a mistake.  He auto-piloted his play of RULERS, and in doing so he committed a fundamental error:  losing count of how many tiles were in the bag, with AINNSST? unseen to him and a bingo available with it on row 14, and 6 tiles in the bag, he played six tiles.  In other words, HE HAD EMPTIED THE BAG.   If I had drawn an E or the second blank instead of a duplicated N after PEC, I win this game with an out bingo of ENTASIS on row 14.  If he doesn't empty the bag, even if I do get my bingo, the only way he loses is if he's left the Y in the bag for me, as he otherwise has enough points coming back on row 15 to be able to counter my would-be bingo.  As for this, it was the last game of what had been a very frustrating day, there was no win available, and I just moved tiles to end the game.  Best is 14I SNITS if Quackle is to be belived.

#note And Darrell has an out bingo of EcDYsON that he misses. :-)
