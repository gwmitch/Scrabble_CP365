#note With incomplete information, the game continued as follows, per Phil Appleby on the uk-scrabble listserv:

"After a short word each from the two Scrabble supremos, the score stood at 334-278 in favour of Nyman. Nyman played yet another bingo, JINGOES, in his next move for a score of 82 points, while Richards with OUKAIDO on his rack, played DOOK for 28 points. Nyman then moved ahead to 440 points with IMPALA and he looked set for late runaway victory. The fire with which the game had started appeared to be dying out. In his next draw from the tile bag, however, Richards picked a blank. The game hot up again when Nyman played his fifth bingo ANESTRUM, using the M to represent the blank tile and boosting his score to a seemingly untouchable 534 points. One of the greatest Scrabble games ended with Richards' fourth bingo, a demonic JANIZARS, using the blank to represent J for 122 points with the mighty Z falling on a triple-letter premium square. The final score read 534-483 with the game going to Nyman."
