#note This play is crappy -- CHROMY and CHROMYL in line D are among the better options. Keeping LMNR is bad. Don't try this at home, kids.

#note This doesn't play after CHROMY. Just saying.

#note Missed PRE(CUTTING); this is 3-4 points back.

#note I probably play one intentional phony per year. This seemed like a good spot for the 2012 edition. I knew it was TUNGSTIC, not SCUTTING*, but didn't expect him to risk a turn when he still had a comfortable lead.

#note Blah, tried to find one ending in Y for the six extra points, failed miserably. It's COARSELY or CAJOLERY. I was trying to play quickly since he was getting low on time, but that's no excuse. Shoulda found those.

#note Yep, that's the only win. This kid can play.
