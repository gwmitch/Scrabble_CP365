#note I'm warning you: this is my worst played game of Scrabble in recent memory.
>Wayne_Barclay: NQU 11B QU.N +26 50
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EEINPRT G5 PRI.TENE +62 84
#note Yes, I really did this. I missed PREUNITE and played a misspelling of an everyday word. Wow, that is beyond words.
>Wayne_Barclay: ELX H10 LEX +39 89
#note Setting up a sexy QUIN.NE spot if someone can get an I or O.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BDERRST 12F D..TERS +30 114
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BDERRST --  -30 84
#note This was an intentional phony I thought I could get away with. I couldn't find anything better. Although I missed C11 URB, which looks fine.
>Wayne_Barclay: GGI 6F G.IG +10 99
#note Looks like Wayne isn't seeing the QUIN.NE spot.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BDERRST C11 .RB +12 96
#note Now I see it.

>Wayne_Barclay: AFR 5D FRA. +21 199
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?CEEMMS 4A MEME +32 200
#note Missed some really cool bingos: MESMERIC and SEMEMIC. Although LEXEME is the best play, and an obvious one that I missed. I need to train my brain to remember to look for extensions like that. MEME actually outsims the bingos, though I can't imagine not playing SEMEMIC if I had known it.
>Wayne_Barclay: AEINNT A4 .ANNITE +27 226
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AACEIS L1 ACEdIAS +71 271
#note Again I am not paying attention to extensions. LEXICA is the play. And I'm an idiot here. I was bemoaning "Oh I finally got an I/O and I have to bingo instead of taking the QUIN.NE spot." NO YOU DON'T! CIS is 48, dumbie! Blugh. Anyways, I picked ACEDIAS since it seemed to hinder the most bingo lanes. I didn't bleed a ton of equity on this turn (12pts or so), but I'm annoyed with the careless misses I made here.
>Wayne_Barclay: AWY 1L .WAY +30 256
#note Wayne is usually one of the slowest players at club, but this game he's outracing me. He has 7 mins left to my 4. We're both really low with lots of tiles left.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ABLPRV 12J V.RB +18 289
#note I'm suddenly aware of my time issues and start playing rashly. I decide to start taking liberties with the case S/blank. That's not a bad thing to do. VERBAL sims better, but that seemed unnecessarily dangerous. I have a lead and the blank, why get reckless. 12J LAV sims best, which I simply don't get. What if he has an A?? Plus I hated killing that QUIN.NE spot when I had a feeling Wayne wasn't seeing it.
>Wayne_Barclay: HOO 2L .OHO +38 294
#note Yikes he's all caught up.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ADJLPT 3B PAD +31 320
#note I'm panicking with the closeness of the score and my nonbingoable tiles and low time. 10F JELL is the play. I missed it.
>Wayne_Barclay: AZ 2A ZA +32 326
#note Eep.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?AJKLTV 10F J..L +27 347
#note Now I see it. But, with the last A gone, the sim goes back to prefering F12 LAV. This time I understand it.
>Wayne_Barclay: ILLT 1B TILL +11 337
#note JILL and JILT!
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?ACKNTV 3I C.e.K +46 393
#note With a minute left, I slapped down 3I CRAEK* without spinning the board around. Then I looked closely and realised I was about to make a big mistake. Panicking some more, I switched to this. Quackle says I'm an idiot for burning my blank for ten extra points. (3H CARVEN). That's fair, but CARVEN scares me with an H unseen. Also, I didn;t have time to assess the unseen pool, but I felt like I was killing the scariest spot with this play, so I didn't see how it could lose. It sims terribly, obviously. But I'm just happy I didn't play CRAEK.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ANNOOTV O10 NOVA +15 408
>Wayne_Barclay: DHIIOTU F12 DUH +26 377
#note I have no idea what he played here, but apparently neither of us added it to the final score. I think this is what he did. As if QUININE/ONE never happened.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: NOT N9 TON +11 419
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe:  (IIOT) +8 427
#note -10 to Wayne for overtime. I finished with 0:02
