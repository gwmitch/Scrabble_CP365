>Jim_Burlant: FGIUVYZ 8G GUV +14 14
#note Yuck!  While there are 30 points available for FIZ, the GUVY leave is SO bad that it's worth giving up the 16 scoreboard points.  This is slightly preferable to VUG, as the only back hook this takes is the S; VUG also takes the G.
>Mike_Early: HLOU G5 LOU.H +14 14
>Jim_Burlant: DEFISWY F4 YEW +32 46
#note Lost the Z on an overdraw.  Surprisingly, despite giving up huge scoreboard points to F2 WIFEY, Championship Player says this is the silver medalist, albeit at a deficit of 4% winning chances and 7.5 equity to F2 WIFEY, which scores 45.  WIFEY should have been the play; I was letting myself get rushed into Mike's warp speed playing tempo and it took another turn for me to settle myself down.
>Mike_Early: B 5E B.. +10 24
>Jim_Burlant: AADFISZ J6 ZAS +40 86
#note Best.  FAYS 4D is also a strong choice.  I thought that, with him being close to something, I should limit his  options.   And the 40 points don't hurt, either.  I'm 68% to win.
>Mike_Early: AENR K4 NEAR +21 45
>Jim_Burlant: ADEFISS 4D FA.S +34 120
#note I also considered FADS L3. Even with the extra volatility created by the O front hook to FAYS, I wanted to keep DEIS together.  Q says either play is as good as the other.  L4 EFS is also worth consideration. 
>Mike_Early: CEIOS C3 COSIE +27 72
>Jim_Burlant: DEINOQS 6B Q. +31 151
#note Though QIS also scores 44 at 8A, this is too promising of a leave to break it up.  The sim agrees; this play wins 1% more often than QIS and is best.
>Mike_Early: AEMW 3J WAME +23 95
>Jim_Burlant: DDEINOS D7 NODDIES +72 223
#note Scores 2 more at 10A, but that's nowhere near enough points to justify slotting the triple.  Q agrees - this is best and it's 95% to win.
>Mike_Early: EEH L1 HE.E +30 125
>Jim_Burlant: GJLPRTU 1K T.URL +24 247
#note Best.  No good leave is salvagable, so just turn as many tiles as possible to clear the garbage.  And this had another benefit.
>Mike_Early: ADEKNRY -  +0 125
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AGIIJPP C12 PIG +20 267
#note A little risky with 2 blanks unseen, but I figured that I have enough of a lead to withstand anything he could hit on row 15.  This is best in Quackle's eyes, and it's 97-1/2% to win.
>Mike_Early: ADEKNRY -ADEKNRY +0 125
#note Shocked that Mike would have risked losing two turns challenging THURL if he was sitting on this much dreck.  
>Jim_Burlant: AIJPX B13 PAX +35 302
#note I forgot to write this rack down.  In a closer game I'd think twice about putting this down.  But with my lead about to go up to 177 points, I'm not too worried about giving back 45 points since the bag keeps emptying.  Play incorrectly scored as 36.
>Mike_Early: BO A14 BO +45 170
>Jim_Burlant: EIJNTTY F9 ENTITY +24 326
#note With this lead, the bag down to 33, and no worthwhile J play available, I wasn't concerned about building a rack.   I wanted to empty the bag as quickly as possible.  Q agrees in principle, though its execution is far slicker than mine:  H5 TENUITY scores 29.   This is the bronze medalist, though I probably should have played at L7 (the silver medalist) instead of here.
>Mike_Early: AC 10B CA. +12 182
>Jim_Burlant: EGIIJOR I8 .IGOR +10 336
#note One of the things that's making it easy for me to implement my bag-emptying strategy is the tile pool.  Take a good look at how incredibly balanced it is.  This or VOGIE are the only plays available that turn more than 3 tiles.  And, since I have the J, this potentially sets up JERID, JADED, etc. at H11.
>Mike_Early: ADELM H11 MEDAL +34 216
>Jim_Burlant: EIIJNRT L7 TINIER +17 353
#note Continuing with the rapid-fire bag emptying.  This is best.
>Mike_Early: FK 11K K.F +20 236
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEJNTU E3 J.. +12 365
#note Now that I've got an almost sure bingo in my rack, yeah, I'll fish - especially since the bag is down to 8 and I've got an almost certain bingo coming back.  Not the preferred play, but this wound up working out in my favor.  Q prefers 2F JUNTA, presumably for turnover to go after the second blank; had I done that, the final score would have wound up much closer.
>Mike_Early: ?AEILTV 14H .VEnTAIL +74 310
>Jim_Burlant: ?AENOTU N3 sOUTANE +67 432
#note The only bingo.
>Jim_Burlant:  (DINOORR) +16 448
