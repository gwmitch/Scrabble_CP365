#note Really?  JAB?  I'd rather balance the rack (granted, the B isn't great but with the L it's good).

#note Best bingo and the only 2x2.  Already 88% to win.

#note Best, despite the leave.  L11 YOU also worth consideration.

#note Best.

#note After the game, Orry told me this was his rack.  The sim says he's 11% to win with this, his best play.  When this came down on the heels of EVERT, I figured that he was now in his groove and I was expecting him to mount a serious comeback.  He's rated over 2000 for very good reason, despite my lead I was not taking this game for granted just yet.

#note I don't quite get Quackle here. Q says I should just dink off EH at 13L for 22 and it doesn't like this much Against a vastly superior player, I'm more than content to keep the tiles turning and scoring big.  EH ostensibly wins 92% and this wins 89.  HORSE (which I didn't see) should have been the play IMO.

#note Or LONE.  This is 97% to win.
>Orry_Swift: IIINT -II +0 104
#note Orry drew two I's when he dumped his N's with NUN.
>Jim_Burlant: ?EEIOSS 14G SOIrEES +60 299
#note In a closer game I pass this up due to the board position, and I almost did here.  But with the bag half empty, I did the math and realized that this put me up 299 - 104.  He'll need 3 more bingos AND a huge X or Q play that this board may not have left in it.  Anything I can put down here wins over 99%.   Best is apparently 9H JEON.  As for other bingoes, MEIOSES, pOESIES, and EOSINES all score 62.
>Orry_Swift: INOPRST 15C TROPINS +90 194
#note Best bingo for Orry.  Even with this, he's still only 1% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: AIKQTWX C13 QA. +24 323
#note Now I don't worry about equity - there really isn't much life in this board and shutting it down is the name of the game, so Quackle's first choice of TWIXT strikes me as being stupid.  That said, QI 14B probably would have been better; this does give him a shot at a bingo ending in IER - something I didn't consider at the time.  For the rest of the game I just try to score points while not opening anything up. If he can open up, I'll resume going for equity.  But my tactic was to make sure he couldn't get back in it, not that his tiles gave him much hope of that.

#note CUTIE scores 9 more, but it gives him CRAVEN on row 1 for 36. I wanted to prevent that.  And now his only viable play gives me an out play.
