>Jim_Burlant: IO 9F OI +10 26
>Matt_Canik: EEILNOV 10C OVINE +20 47
#note Static prefetted VOE 9B, but the sim likes this. It's a little reckless/aggressive and unlike me, but I'm trying to open things up in my game.
>Jim_Burlant: ABCEILT B6 CITABLE +90 116
#note Nope, not opening things up anymore.
>Matt_Canik: ?CEEIIL 12A C.ILI +20 67
#note I just can't leave A12 open, he hits it for cheap and is suddenly winning by 100 if I play VICE. 
>Jim_Burlant: DMMUY 11G DUMMY +31 147
>Matt_Canik: ?ADEETX 7H rETAXED +67 134
#note bETAXED is the only other playable bingo.

>Matt_Canik: AEEORRS 6L ORE +21 155
#note This is just unexcusable. REASO(N)ER 15C.

>Jim_Burlant: AEK A7 KEA +35 236
>Matt_Canik: IIOTTUZ 8L OI +17 252
#note This is me being paranoid. OI closes down the 2nd to last viable bingo line here, leaving only a 3x3 at O8. For whatever reason, I missed ZITI(S) N10, and would have played that, but like this above any other choices. This also has the possibility of me drawing an E for ZE(S)T O12 69. 
>Jim_Burlant: EGHNN M13 N.H +12 248
#note He set down HENG(E) I3, then picked it up and played this here. Not playing HAG makes me think he's got two Ns and not one, and not playing EH 10I makes me thing he's very conso-heavy. 
>Matt_Canik: ADITTUZ 13C DITZ +38 290
>Jim_Burlant: GHU O12 GU.H +30 278
>Matt_Canik: ANQRRTU K2 QUANT. +34 324
#note I see QUANT(A), QUANT(ED), and QUA N10. But I kinda figure with how friendly the pool's starting to look that he'll bingo in the J column if nothing else. QUANT(ED) gave up easy O1 plays, but I guess I should be willing to sacrifice the points for the extra closure. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEILN 4F ALIEN.tE +66 344
#note He would have ALIENE(E)s even if I don't open this lane, so that makes me feel a little better. 
>Matt_Canik: AEFRRST 9M FAR +21 345
#note FE(U)AR 3I probably wins this game a lot more than this. 
>Jim_Burlant: FRY F2 FR.Y +18 362
>Matt_Canik: AEGPRST 3C GAR.ET +21 366
#note There are a million thinks wrong with this play. I'm not even going to try to justify this. I started blankly at the board for like 8 minutes, couldn't think of anything, then just played this. Fucking terrible. (Jim's blog was a little censored).
