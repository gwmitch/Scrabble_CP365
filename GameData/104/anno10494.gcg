>Jim_Burlant: ADEENRT 8G DE +6 6
#note Sometimes it sucks to go first.  Anyway - the play, depending on your style preference, is either this or exchange N; this sims roughly 3/4% and 1 point down on exchange N.  For this game, ED woould probably have been much better.
>Paul_Holser: EINZ I7 ZEIN +28 28
>Jim_Burlant: AEHNRTT J6 HAT +30 36
#note Any number of choices.  Q prefers that I play the whole rack with J6 HATTER for 41.  I considered it, but liked the ENRT leave too much and liked my bingo chances enough that I thought 30 followed by a  bingo was better than 40 followed by a random rack.  This takes a mild hit in the sim; HATTER wins 51%; this wins 49-1/2 and sims not quite 4 points down.
>Paul_Holser: BOP K5 BOP +33 61
>Jim_Burlant: EHLNNRT L3 THEN +24 60
#note Best, and I'm 40% to win.
>Paul_Holser: ?EEIINR 3F REIgNI.E +66 127
#note Or RETINITE, or REINVITE or REINCITE.
>Jim_Burlant: ?DELNRS 11C DaRNELS +78 138
#note Numerous options, and 11C is the best placement.  Other choices: LaNDERS, RoNDELS, LeNDERS, ReLENDS, etc.  Still treading water, at 46%.
>Paul_Holser: AEVW H1 WA.VE +45 172
>Jim_Burlant: GJLNORU D8 JUG.L +40 178
#note Or JOUAL; stylistic preference as to whether you prefer opening up the S hook and/or leaving yourself RNG instead of NOR. I prefer not giving up the easy S hook while simultaneously keeping a vowel. Still treading water; I've been 45% or thereabouts to win since the second turn, and nothing's changed.
>Paul_Holser: ADIRUUX N1 RADIX +35 207
#note Post-mortem Paul told me this was his rack.  Q says he should just dump the U's cheap with ULU H10.
>Jim_Burlant: IINNORT O4 NITRO +30 208
#note Three plays stand out at the top of the sim, and even after 1000+ iterations, the sim is still toggling between them.  1L NORI, INRO, and this choice are the 3.  I saw the 30 points and felt I had to stay in the game.
>Paul_Holser: COUUY 1L CO.Y +36 243
#note Then again, does he get 36 points if I play NORI on the previous turn?
>Jim_Burlant: ACEINOP H10 A.PINE +35 243
#note Spent a couple of minutes figuring out for myself what Quackle confirms with a click of the "Generate Choices" button:  this is my second no-go in as many games.  I almost put down E5 CAPO, which is almost as strong in the sim's eyes.  I saw the points for this and felt I couldn't pass them up.  Q agrees; this is best, with CAPO a strong second.
>Paul_Holser: EKOUY F1 EU.OKY +23 266
>Jim_Burlant: AACGOOR 5B CROA. +22 265
#note Q likes E6 AGO; not sure why I missed that or 1A AGORAE, which would have been better.  AGO wins 34%' this wins 29.
>Paul_Holser: AEIIMTU 14F MI.UTIAE +68 334
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV 1A GAVOT. +33 298
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV --  -33 265
#note My second no-go in 3 turns and my 3rd in two games.  Small consolation:  LOVAGE 1A (the play I couldn't think of, which is best) barely wins 7%, and that's against a random rack.  Against his post-bingo rack of ABDFFLS (Paul told me this after the game) it doesn't even win 5.
>Paul_Holser: ABDFFLS 1A BAFFL. +54 388
#note Had I played the legitimate play of LOVAGE 1A, Paul was going to play BAFFLE M9 for 34, giving him a 70-point lead and leaving DS in his rack.
>Jim_Burlant: AEGLOTV N8 GAVOT +20 285
#note Missing LOVAGE again.
>Paul_Holser: DIOST O11 DOITS +27 415
>Jim_Burlant: AELMRUW G13 M.R +17 302
>Paul_Holser: EGOQSS 9B SQ.EG +25 440
>Jim_Burlant: AELUW 2B WAE +32 334
>Paul_Holser: OS G7 O.S +23 463
#note Prior to losing the turn on GAVOTE*, HAT was style preference, and the only real mistake I'd made this game was CROAK.  Assuming I made Quackle's preferred play of AGO E6 leaving ACOR, I don't have a no-go bingo rack; I was irked to see the V come right out of the bag and only as the rack came together did I see that I had VOLTAGE after I played CROAK.  So, with no bingo in hand and Paul about to play BAFFLE for 34, I'm down 70, he possesses all the hooks for row 15M and I have no bingo.  Suffice it to say, MINUTIAE clinched the game for him.  Just like the game with Sam - while not finding LOVAGE cost me a bunch of spread, by the time I started screwing up, the game was already toast.
