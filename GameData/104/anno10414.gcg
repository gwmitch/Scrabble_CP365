#note it seems like gamy or cagy have something to be said for them because they take out more lanes - but there are still places to bingo on the board even if I play those, and gym is a lot more points.

#note this is a bit of a weird play, but I liked the turnover and blocking the scariest lanes on the board and not giving too much back. quackle's overwhelming favorite here is COWL because it bingoes so much more, but on winning percentage this actually is not so far off.

#note it looks weird, but I have the case S and this basically kills all the remaining bingo lanes. VOW sims a little better (I wasn't thinking about that so much). I guess the pool is actually quite terrible anyway, but I do like having the S hook available for future turns.
