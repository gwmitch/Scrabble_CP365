>Evans_Clinchy: HLMNORY K5 HOY +32 64
#note This play is crappy -- CHROMY and CHROMYL in line D are among the better options. Keeping LMNR is bad. Don't try this at home, kids.
>Mack_Meller: ?AADNRV 4H VeRANDA +88 191
#note I didn't see VANwARD at 4G, but while it is 6 points less, I do think it is worth considering. Since VeRANDA takes a back H or S, he can easily play a word down column O for 50+ points. In a 10,000 iteration sim, Quackle suggests that VeRANDA is valued at 5 points higher than VaNWARD, but I do think the two plays are close.

>Mack_Meller: AEKRSSU 11K RAKUS +33 258
#note In a short 3,000 iteration sim, RAKUS and UKE at 10M for 17 are valued within a point of each other, with RAKUS slightly superior. I think the 16 point sacrifice might be worth it. UKE retains a much better leave, blocks possible high-scoring plays down column N, and RAKUS leaves open column N, and opens row 12.

>Evans_Clinchy: ILORSTU C2 TROILUS +77 233
#note SCUTTING*. I wasn't sure if it was good, but at this point didn't want to give him another turn to get back within a bingo or less.
>Mack_Meller: CEEEGNV L8 VEG.N +32 345
#note This play sims about equal, perhaps a tad below GENEVA at L6 for 28, since EC is definitely a solid margin better than EEC as a leave.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AEIMXY G5 MIX. +49 282
>Mack_Meller: AACDEEN H1 DEA.E +31 376
#note I believe this was my rack, perhaps I had a T instead of an N. Either way, DEAVE sims best.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?AELORY D8 .LAYmORE +76 358
>Mack_Meller: ACIILNT 15A LIC. +18 394
#note Quackle suggests plays like 14A IATRIC or NITRIC, but I think either 14B NARIC or 15D ELICIT are best, as he can play for a big score down column a after either play at 14A.
