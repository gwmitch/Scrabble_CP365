>Noah: ABDDESU 8D DAUBED +24 24
>Isaac: EKOP D4 POKE. +24 24
>Noah: ILMPRRS E5 PIL.R +30 54
#note Considered PRIM, because it doesn't give a nice scoring spot like PILAR, but PILAR's equity seems worth it.
>Isaac: AIN 7G ANI +16 40
>Noah: EEGLMRS F2 LEGER +24 78
#note Seems fine. I thought about MEG, too, but thought this would be a bit better thanks to the extra points. MEG has some defensive qualities, but not really enough to play it, I think, especially since it's keeping a bingo leave anyway.
>Isaac: EHI 6I HIE +15 55
>Noah: AIMNSUY L1 YAMUNS +37 115
#note I could also play YUM C3 or 5K. AINS is pretty crappy after YUM 5K, and not that great after C3 either. I'll take points and some great lane closing against Isaac.
>Isaac: HILNT 1G THINL. +36 91
>Noah: EGIILOW 5J OW. +24 139
#note Could play OWE, but I'm still not a fan of that type of play here.
>Isaac: UX M2 XU +35 126
>Noah: EGIILOS N2 EGO +34 173
#note Interesting play...EGIS isn't a bad play at all here. IILS isn't that great and the scoring spot is far worse after EGIS. I seriously considered EGIS, but I think I should've played it.
>Isaac: C 5C C... +8 134
>Noah: AAEIILS B1 LIAISE +25 198
#note Perhaps ILIA 2E instead? While this opens scoring spots to counterbalance Isaac's likely O column bingo, there are two reasonable spots which I can't use both of, so they will usually balance themselves out anyway. Still, I think it's worth the points here.

#note I didn't see any plays that justified a point sacrifice over bingoing.
>Isaac: ?ADNRRY H13 .RY +18 359
#note His actual rack. Seems a good try to me.
>Noah: EGORUVV 3E R.V +10 425
#note Awesome! Happy to make the best play here :).
