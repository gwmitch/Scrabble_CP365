>Chris_Canik: AGIOOTW 8F WOO +12 12
#note WOG is better? Whoops.
>Kate_Watson: AVY F8 .AVY +21 21
>Chris_Canik: AEGIIIT 10F .IGIA +11 23
#note Better than exchanging by 4.5%.
>Kate_Watson: UV H10 .UV +11 32
>Chris_Canik: AEEINTU 11J EAU +8 31
#note This is why I'm bad. I got too focused on the EINT leave, I guess. VAUNTIE is 3% better, VENUE and AVENUE are 1.6% better. This is the next-best choice.
>Kate_Watson: DILO 11B DOIL. +18 50
>Chris_Canik: EEINRTW B4 RETWINE. +66 97
#note Phoneyyyyy. I knew either this bullshit or WINTERED was good, just couldn't remember which. Thankfully, Kate didn't, either.
>Kate_Watson: ?CDEINS 13B CaNDIES +78 128
#note On second thought, this is probably why she didn't even hold my phoney. DIoCES(A)N would've been cool, but I'm not going to criticize.
>Chris_Canik: ABDNNNO A8 BAN +31 128
>Kate_Watson: CEKO A1 COKE +36 164
>Chris_Canik: ADLNNOS C2 LAND +16 144
#note Quackle likes either DEN 5A or ON C7 better, but only by a few tenths. A small mistake on my part.
>Kate_Watson: AELP D1 PALE +30 194
>Chris_Canik: ENOQRSY L10 Q.ERY +34 178
>Kate_Watson: ELORT 1D .ETROL +24 218
>Chris_Canik: DNNOSTX 12K N.XT +13 191
#note Another small mistake. Quackle says N(O)D(I) G7 is better by 1.2%... I guess I can see the wisdom. N(E)XT is fourth. It also says D(E)TOX is better, along with X(E)NON. I'm not so sure of that, especially given that once the 15O triple gets taken after either of those two plays, the scoring potential of this board goes to shit, and I'd be down by a bingo. I didn't make the best play, but I think I made the second-best.
>Kate_Watson: ?AEEIIR N8 InER.IAE +68 286
#note Then again, if this happens, then it really doesn't matter.
>Chris_Canik: DNOSTUU O6 DONUT +27 218
#note Hm. Once again, I'll defend my choice of DONUT at 6O against the same at 4O. Playing this here means that once she makes any sort of parallel play, probably from N2, then every bingo lane on the board is gone aside from J1. Whereas with this placement, she's a little more hard-pressed to take the same spot, leaving my bingo chances high. And yes, it's getting to the deficit level where I'll need a bingo.
Another interesting option is (R)U(I)N, 13L. I think it's not wise to leave the triple open, especialy with both F's and the J and Z still unseen. 
>Kate_Watson: HR 15M H.R +18 304
>Chris_Canik: AEMSSUZ C8 ZA +30 248
#note I'm a little confused as to why (C)UM B13 is 7% better than this.
Also - misscored as 32.
>Kate_Watson: AEGS D6 AGES +26 330
>Chris_Canik: EJMSSTU I6 JUS +18 266
#note JUS 7H is obviously the play. This is second, but essentially suicide. Need to leave the T hook.
>Kate_Watson: BGHR 7H B.RGH +15 345
>Chris_Canik: EIMOSTT 2H MOTIEST +78 344
>Chris_Canik: EIMOSTT --  -78 266
#note I know this is bullshit, but I have to hope that she doesn't or that my intuition of its bullshittiness is wrong. Would be the last play, so she'd've been stupid to not challenge. Gg.
