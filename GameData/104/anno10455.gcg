#note I feel like FAY is setting up an X bomb. AREAE also does really cool things to this board.

#note I know I just thought about the X bomb, but after looking around I convince myself that he played it simply to try to open things up. and even if he hits his X, I can hit the TWS back.

#note He said he had INSTATE/SCURRIED but missed the hook. Given that only one T is unseen, it's safe to assume this was his rack.

#note A J bingo would be devastating, I'll let him score 66 with a baby bingo instead and hit him back.
