#note The next turn, I see the HOWF hook. And then realize I could have played it this turn. I have this thing about me when I play- if I KNOW I've made a mistake, I get pissed at myself and play like ass the remainder of that game with the mindset 'i dont deserve to win'

#note So I'm left with a choice here- try to block something, try to set up my rack for a bingo, or score? well I can't really score, with As and Is in the bag I think my rack will likely balance itself, and with B, F, and 3 lines open, I don't think I can really stop him from bingoing.
