#note 270 in 3 moves should normally put one in a commanding lead.
>Brett_Smitheram: AUV O12 UV.A +24 220
>Toh_Weibin: AMMOOPS E4 MOOP +31 301
#note The cute MAOM(A)O L10 (which takes S in CSW12) sims second. I didn't see it, and probably would have picked it over my play.

>Brett_Smitheram: FHO D11 FOH +38 340
>Toh_Weibin: AAEEQRS M13 Q. +22 363
#note It seemed fairly reasonable to play the Q off here. Relooking at the move though, it may have been the fatal error of the game. With a conducive board like that I could have exchanged AEQ and picked up a strong score next move. Quackle likes (Z)E(T)A, and it does seem like risking the Q leave is the best choice here - just a bit too much volatility with the exchange, I feel.
>Brett_Smitheram: EEJT D1 JETE +48 388
>Toh_Weibin: AAEEIRS 9I .E.A +21 384
#note Another tough choice here - though (Z)E(T)A sims top I feel I could have played more vowels off with (K)AIE. (Z)A(T)I is another play to consider sins there are more Is in the bag, but it doesn't sim as well surprisingly. What sims second is AE C13, presumably because it keeps the M column fully open. Thoughts, anyone?
>Brett_Smitheram: ?GINNOU 1D .OUNcING +95 483
>Toh_Weibin: AAEEIRS C2 EA +10 394
#note I spent a lot of time on this move, knowing that I'd probably lost after that horror draw. I thought any play that didn't open a new line would be wrong - the M column can easily be blocked.
>Brett_Smitheram: ABDILR B2 BRIDAL +35 518
>Toh_Weibin: AEEIRST A6 AERIEST +78 472
#note Being 124 down I knew the game was pretty much over. I could have fished somewhere to force Brett to empty the bag and then bingo out, but I didn't think thatl would win the game. Besides, I needed to score well with 3 tiles, which seemed difficult...
>Brett_Smitheram: DGLLTVY N10 VLY +22 540
#note VLY G11 is better - apparently not worth blocking the out spot.
>Toh_Weibin: HIOW B10 HI +28 500
#note Playing G12 OW is 6 points better. I didn't see Brett's next play.
