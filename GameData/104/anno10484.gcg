#note Bingoing is not best
>Jim_Burlant: ?INSSTX G7 S.X +19 19
#note Saw SIXTEENS, couldn't think of SEXTAINS.   Championship Player says that, while this is a 2-1/2 point dog to G7 SEXTAINS, SEXTAINS is best and this wins 1% less often.
>Kristina_Simon: ADERV D8 .RAVED +24 44

#note Best is 10G TUSHING for 79.

#note Quackle wants me to live dangerously with a play I admit I didn't see:  MONA(ZIT)E 4D 38.  10C HAMATE (which I didn't know ) looks like the best play here.  This isn't bad, though and it's 69% to win.
>Kristina_Simon: CELOV E3 CLOVE. +22 120
>Jim_Burlant: AEHNOOT 3C NA.HO +22 168
#note No real standouts.  Best is 10F ATONE 25.  This is one of the top plays.  Other options are 10F ATONE, 5H AGONE.  
>Kristina_Simon: IRW F2 W.IR +22 142
>Jim_Burlant: EGNOORT 5I ..GO +12 180
#note I did not like opening up but this really didn't leave me much choice.  After a few hundred 2-ply iterations, this or 10G TOO are the best plays.  Treading water here, holding steady at 68% winning chances.
>Kristina_Simon: FU L4 F.U +12 154
>Jim_Burlant: EINOQRT 2B QI +24 204
#note Autopiloted this play and missed 13A QUOD in the process.  But this miss winds up benefitting me.
>Kristina_Simon: NP 12A P.N. +11 165
>Jim_Burlant: ENOORTT 1C TOO +7 211
#note Playing scared.  Despite my lead, the progression of these racks has not left me feeling very comfortable.  I keep unloading O's, I keep getting them back. Kristina is obviously very close to something and I didn't want to give her an easy run at row 11 if she didn't have an S.  Yes, there's the O column, but without an S she probably scores 65 or less there where row 11 could give her 70+.  Q prefers 10F OTTO, which I didn't look for.
>Kristina_Simon: ADERSTY 10G YARD +26 191
#note Crucial moment.  She told me after the game that she realized that she'd missed STRAYED on this turn.  Maybe she'd have found it if I took yard away with OTTO? And more importantly, even though she only turned 4, she told me after the game she landed the blank on this turn.  Perhaps a very different game if she hits STRAYED and she hits the blank to go with it.
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRT 13D .ENDRITE +63 274
#note The only bingo.  Even against an inferred EST?, this is winning 65%.  
>Kristina_Simon: ?EEEST H13 .EE +9 200
>Jim_Burlant: ACELMNY 12I MANLY +28 302
#note Simmed against an inferred EST?, Q prefers 12I LAYMEN.  I'd rather not unload the E.  This is mid pack.
>Kristina_Simon: AIOT M1 IOTA +13 213
>Jim_Burlant: AACEFII 1J FAC.AE +42 344
#note Best, and it's 97% to win.
