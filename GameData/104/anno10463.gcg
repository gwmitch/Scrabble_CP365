>Jason_Randolph: AAEGV 8D AGAVE +20 20
>Matt_Canik: AELORUU 7H ROULEAU +61 61
#note Not sure where to play this, or if placement *really* makes that big a difference. If he has the X, he can just hit ROULEAUX anyway, and the top is a little more defensive to big 8L plays. 
>Jason_Randolph: PXY 6L PYX +65 85
#note Oh, of course.
He said he also had the Q for the other U here. 
>Matt_Canik: BDMOOOZ 6F ZOOM +42 103
#note Didn't know the Z would be my only power tile this game. 
>Jason_Randolph: AHW 8J HAW +32 117
>Matt_Canik: BDDIOOR 9D BOD +16 119
#note Couldn't decide between this and (A)DOBO. Picked this because it's more defensive. 
>Jason_Randolph: BILT F2 BLIT. +22 139
>Matt_Canik: DEIIIOR -IIO +0 119
#note I am an IDIO(T). 
>Jason_Randolph: ADQU 10B QUAD +44 183
#note I say "I bet you don't have an S but draw one."
>Matt_Canik: CDEHINR 3C CHI.DREN +84 203
#note He laughs after I play this and says "I didn't have an S and just drew one."
>Jason_Randolph: ACSV A7 VACS +42 225
>Matt_Canik: EGINTTT 4I TETTING +74 277
>Matt_Canik: EGINTTT --  -74 203
#note I knew this was no good when I played it, but wanted to see if I could slip it by nonetheless.
>Jason_Randolph: ILST O7 SLIT +20 245
>Matt_Canik: EGINTTT D8 ...TING +20 223
#note Given the way he just killed that S for 20, I'm guessing he has another for GODS and want to block that. Was forn between (GOD)ET and (ABA)TING but chose this one because GINTT is ugly unless I draw a vowel. 
>Jason_Randolph: ?ENPRRS 12B PR.NtERS +60 305
#note My hunch was right, I block SPuRNER 2x2 (which he did see), and he plays this over PERRoNS for 78.

#note Trying to preserve any shot at a row 13 bingo. 
>Jason_Randolph: AFIJO 10G F.IJOA +32 422
#note hahahahahaha. ok.
