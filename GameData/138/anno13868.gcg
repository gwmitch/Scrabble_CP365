#note this was a tough play, UNWRAP sims ~3 better because it gives much fewer scoring opportunities.

#note oh dear, since my 7s didn't fit I figured I had to try this even though I wasn't sure if it was good...I still think it's a gamble worth taking even if I think there's only a ~25% chance of it working out

#note I was pretty happy to see this go down
>JD: EFINOSW 10B WIFES +31 281
#note just trying to play it safe, it's hard to believe I managed to lose from this point. I should really just play WINO and keep my S.
>Dan_Goodwin: ?ACENRS N8 .NCREASe +80 195
>JD: EINOOQT 9C QI +47 328
#note the question...do I take the 47 points for QI, or do I play ONTO at M11? I could only find EON at O13 which I really didn't like, but I'm pretty sure I have to make some kind of blocking play rather than taking the points. After I block his bingo opportunities are really limited, and he's not that likely to block QI.
>Dan_Goodwin: AEILMNT 15G MELANIT. +80 275
>JD: AENOOOT M11 OOT +14 342
#note I almost played OVATE but then switched because I was worried about all of the Os left in the bag...I am blocking the wrong spot here, playing NOO at 14J to prevent him from scoring seems like the way to go since he still has a good lane on row 14 even if I do block the E and the R. just OVATE looks fine too.
>Dan_Goodwin: IPX 14J PIX +39 314
>JD: ABEEFNO 14F FOB +24 366
#note ugh, I botched this. If I am going to play here, I should play BOA or BEEF so that overlaps aren't so easy. quackle thinks that I'm sacrificing too many points with this move and that I'm not actually that big of a favorite, but given what the board looks like I really think that shutting down the obvious bingo lane must be my best option. quacke's choice of FOVEAE isn't bad with all the vowels remaining, and the Y is open at the top of the board, but the focus when you're ahead should always be on stopping the easiest way to come back...but since FOB offers such easy overlaps I think BOA might be the play.
>Dan_Goodwin: ?ACERTU 13A CURATEd +75 389
#note damnit
>JD: AEEEENO K8 .ENAE +16 382
#note drawing 3 vowels was pretty much the worst-case scenario, but it was also preventable
>Dan_Goodwin: HJ D12 H.J +26 415
>JD: DEEGOOS O13 GOS +48 430
#note since GOS at O13 is now basically unblockable, quackle recommends trying to play COG at 13A to take away his easiest scoring spots. I definitely agree, wish I had thought of it.
>Dan_Goodwin: ILMO 15B MOIL +22 437
>JD: AADEEEO 1K AEDE. +7 437
#note I have no wins, and unfortunately there's not much I can do to make it hard for him...optimal play is supposed to lead to a 5-point loss for me. Perhaps my best chance is to play AE at N1, let him play YA/YE and then blocking both his outs with ORU by playing ODEA at 11H and hoping he loses his mind...but really, I am toast unless he's mistracked or something because his best plays are pretty easy to find.
