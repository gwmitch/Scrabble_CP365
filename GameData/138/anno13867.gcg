#note I have to play the Q sometime and if I do it now he doesn't have a lot of good options. I actually laid down CULLYING first.

#note rajput is not available here
>Mike_Ryan: ABGM C5 GAMB +17 280
#note an interesting play that seems to be a Z setup...
>JD: ADINNOR 1A ROAD +36 464
#note the last play sure looked like a Z setup, and I thought about playing something like NO at B6 to stop it and set myself up in the process. But the more I looked the less I saw other plays he could've made with those letters. there's also only one A left for ZA, making the snapback less likely.

#note sure enough
>Mike_Ryan: EELPRST D4 PE +20 309
#note his best is STREP
>JD: AINU 15A NAI.U +15 553
#note unfortunately I didn't add GAMB to his final score, and he went over by 3 minutes so we would up with a 563-262 total.
