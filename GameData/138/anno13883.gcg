#note sometime around this point in the game, a hilarious phony was played on the board next to me, and I just completely lost it for about the next half-hour and started periodically cracking up. it was pretty hard to focus. I think I would normally have seen ALKALOID here.

#note not a great fish, just playing WILL looks a little better

#note with both of my spots for TIDDLER blocked and no other great options, it seemed like a reasonable time to phony, especially since TIDDLY is good. Unfortunately for me, it turns out that George is the person responsible for dictionary additions in the new update that start with the letter T, and he is THE person who found TIDDLIER! What an unfortunate choice of people to try to get a phony past. I didn't see DIRTIED - had I spotted that I may have just played that.

#note did blocks so many of my lanes that it can't be worth playing, since I'm really not down that far might as well play REDID and reset

#note gotta love my decision-making this game, I stare at ENUF for two minutes and then go for ENNUI which is way worse...given the consonant-heavy pool and the two blanks I actually have a 25% chance of bingoing next turn after ENUF.

#note george is signalling a great leave at this point but there's not really that much I can do, quackle's favorite is ROUGH at 11E which I talked my way out of for some reason.

#note with an extremely limited number of vowels left I wanted to keep a vowel-heavy leave and minimize volatility. that said, quackle likes me playing RE at 3J because it makes so many more bingoes fit. actually quackle's favorite is ERE at 3I which I think looks terrible. george has been signaling a really strong leave for many turns by this point so I would rather not open an easy bingo for him by playing at 3J.

#note RICER at F2 is 9 better, blocking his outs and setting up two outs of my own.
