>Cesar: AADEOTV J6 VA.A +23 97
>JD: BEEGSTZ H7 Z.G +13 37
#note JD: at the time a play like this seemed necessary, but ultimately I think BEEST just doesn't bingo enough next turn to be the right play. if I really want a lane here, I think BIZE at H7 is a little better, but I think BEG at J11 and BEGETS at M3, which sims best, are my two best options - ZIG actually blocks a lane even though it sets up my S, and I have plenty of scoring potential after BEGETS even if I don't bingo right away. I think my favorite is BEG.
>Cesar: ADELNOT L5 TOD.LE +21 118
#note jd: of course, it turns out that I blocked all of cesar's bingos. awesome. but this is a nice play
>JD: ABEERST 10B BEATERS +81 118
#note JD: I could also just get lucky and bingo
>Cesar: AALLNPT D7 PAL.TAL +20 138
#note jd: cesar and I argued about this rack on the bus in vancouver. PATELLA sims best by a few points and PLAN at 9C also sims better. I think it's really a question of style - PATELLA may sim better but it's also a lot more volatile, and if cesar likes a closed board better he just do PLAN. PALATAL is pretty good though
>JD: DEKOORR E3 ROOKED +29 147
#note JD: RELOOK looks weird
>Cesar: AEENWXY D2 YEW +30 168
#note D1 WEENY is the play here; i missed it. (-5)
>JD: IMNORST 8A NOM.. +24 171
#note JD: I rushed this play a bit, OMIT at F4 looks best
>Cesar: AAEENNX E10 .AXA +37 205
#note also consideed F1 ANNEX but this seems more defensive and better despite the lame leave.
>JD: AEIRSTU C12 TAU +22 193
#note JD: I opted for this instead of something much fishier like TUI at 5L, it's very close on the sim
>Cesar: ?EEFINN F2 FEN +23 228
#note 3A INF(ER)ENcE is just way too awesome. i feel like i should be able to find it. (-22)
>JD: BEEIRRS F12 IRE +20 213
#note JD: I agonized between IRE and BIER/BRIE at M10. the way cesar had been playing and the game situation make it reasonably likely that he has a blank and I didn't want to open an easy lane just so he could burn me...but quackle suggests that BIER actually doesn't increase his chances of bingoing that much (there are already other lanes) and it gives me a much better chance of bingoing so it should be worthwhile. BRIE to set up BRIER looks pretty good.
>Cesar: ?EGIIJN -FG +0 228
#note 14A JEU here looks very reasonable to me after IRE and i agonized here. most of the time i wouldn't get burned too bad if i play it. A6 JIN was my other choice but i did not want to close my lane. i don't like doing -IJ most of the time; this was just a mistake. (-12)
>JD: BEENRRS 11J B.RE +18 231
>Cesar: ?EGIINQ K4 QI +26 254
#note missed
>JD: EJNRSTU 15D JUSTER +67 298
#note JD: of course, I draw the J that cesar just traded in
>Cesar: ?EEGINS 14H bEIGNES +71 325
#note :(
>JD: ?CLNPUV 13M PUL +20 318
#note JD: now we have a serious game on our hands...the pool is pretty ugly and I would like to block C3, but PUL scores some points and gives me a great shot at a play like VICINAL/INCIVIL if I can draw some of the many vowels. I also prevent him from getting some cheap points.
>Cesar: EFHIIIU -FIIOTU +0 325
#note i can't think of anything worth playing here. exchanging all 7 might be best for the extra information. i also considered keeping FEH as scoring tiles. this draw greatly screws me.
>JD: ?CCINTV 3C C... +12 330
#note JD: quackle's favorite plays here are TIVY/IVY/VINY, all of which also block HERE but turn over more tiles in the process. I can see why quackle likes those plays, but from my perspective I would rather take the relative certainty of being able to hit column O rather than leave myself a rack like CCN? that could go wrong.
>Cesar: AEGHIOO 15K OOH +21 346
#note quackle likes OOHING better by a lot. 13H OHO is also 3 more than my play. OOHING is the best thing for drawing the blank i guess, and it leaves one in the bag, and it gets rid of an i. i was starting to run low on time and wanted to keep scoring and hoped to not draw more than an extra i even though i had just thrown 3 in :(
>JD: ?CIINTV O7 iNCIVI. +36 366
#note JD: it's hard to do this position right with quackle. the two suggestions it comes up with that I think are OK are WONT at 4D, setting up a hook to the triple if I need it and keeping tiles in the bag, or IT at F6. I think IT looks pretty good given that I have a great chance of drawing another play on column O, but I felt like given how ugly the bag is I have a great chance of outrunning him if I do take the certain points on this turn.
>Cesar: AEFGIII A4 FEIG. +13 359
#note his best option
>JD: HOTU 13I HO +21 387
#note JD: we were both pretty low on time but apparently he will U stick me if I play HO right away. This is a whole 13 points worse theoretically, but he also was under heavy time pressure...if he doesn't spot OI at 6L then this is my best play.
>Cesar: AII 11A AI +6 365
>JD: TU 13B T.... +5 392
#note JD: I played this to push him over time since he had played his last move entirely with 00:00 showing, but actually I should just go out anyway!
>Cesar: I 6E .I +8 373
>Cesar:  (U) +2 375
#note final score 392-365 after 10 point time penalty for cesar
