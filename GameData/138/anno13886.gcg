#note Kind of a pivotal turn where I decide not to block the S and the scoring lane with VIMEN. I decided to grab the equity, instead, thinking I could outrun a small bingo to the S. And it seemed unlikely he'd have one anyways. Even in hindsight, I still think it was the right choice. Although in all the wavering, I completely whiffed on the obviously superior ILIUM same spot.

#note Ugh, that draw sucked the life out of me. I can't lose a turn trading, and there's nothing to trade into. I just have to hope this fixes itself.

#note The sim wants me to empty the bag with ZOUAVE. Does that really win 25%? I lose if he has any five-letter word to the triple. And he's certainly have his pick of nice outs in two. I suppose I could infer from RATE that WY may still be in the bag, giving him not too many comebags. But then I have dreck. I dunno. I was fine playing short here to give myself more time for a miracle. I simply couldnt see ZOUAVE working out.

#note Now I'm just out of time. There's obviously a conso in the bag, but I just couldn't find a way to go out in two. This play gives up, but I don't know what wins here. Q says GUV wins 54%. No it doesn't.

#note This was winnable. WISHA was probably the only definitely big mistake, but other stuff is small or even debatable. I think a lot of other people would have blocked CARDINGS and won this game. I did it wrong, I guess.
