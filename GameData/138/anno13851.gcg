#note They playd WOG
ROW N4 and GROW N3 are the best plays, followed by GRILL. WOG 1f WOG woud have been good if it were OWL. The play is held an challenged

#note (D)OLOUR is best, and then O(D)OUR, folowedby exchange kee R, exchange seven, keep L, an keep O. I am now switching to manyply, as it is a very close game. Both teams have pretty terrible tiles at this point, and therre are several good tiles.  unseen. One of these two teams will go on to win, and chances are that the loser gets 3rd. UPO is 15th or so, and is challenged

#note challenged
>Kevin_Bowerman_and_Raymond_Gao: ELOORRS 6B ...S +27 395
#note REROL(L)S gives thema 90 percent chane of winning.The blank is stil out at this point, with 7 tiles in the bag, so if they dump their whole rack playing REROLLS, they have a very high chance of drawig the blank and killing Alex and Ethan's chance o winning this game. I don't think that they will see FARL. ZAGS lost 40 equity for them, andnow they only have a 52 percent chance of winning
