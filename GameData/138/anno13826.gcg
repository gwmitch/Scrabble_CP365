#note Did consider playing way shorter leaving EIMST, but the point difference was pretty big...tough call.

#note Saw the right play a turn later: I3 QADI. Bad miss.
>Frank: AILOPR 4H .IPOLAR +22 233
#note Hahahaha. The best play here is amazing. Answer up next.
>Will: AEIILSY 8K .IYAL +27 248
#note Frank could have played POR(BEAGLE) for 42. Shame on you for missing that, Frank.

#note Yuck. Total whiff on 3C VAC. Not convinced bad VAC is actually as bad as it's simming though.

#note Best bingo against Frank's rack (2A allows UNBOLTS, N8 allows CONSULTS, scoring spot is harmless). But could it possibly be right to not bingo here, maybe playing 7K TAB or 7M BA instead?
>Frank: ?LNOSTU O12 LOT +8 304
>Will: CEEORTU L13 OUT +6 371
#note Well, the top play here appears to be 1A QUOTE. Given that I know Frank has U?, that makes a lot of sense to prevent Q bombs. However, my play of L13 OUT seems to be pretty strong when Frank is given NUS?. It seemed like a 90+ point bingo would be tough to recover from here...don't I have to at least try to address it, despite the risk?
>Frank: ?IMNOSU 15H MaNI.OUS +143 447
>Will: CEEKPRR 2A .RK +14 385
#note Extremely out of time now from thinking about ANABASES and OUT.

>Frank: INU K1 NU +4 459

#note Lost 20 on time. Not good to miss the better QADI and VAC, but an entertaining game nonetheless.
