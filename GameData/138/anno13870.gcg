#note confusing sim results, I am pretty surprised that LEND for 16 setting up an S hook to the triple can sim 4 points better than the exchange. Sure, I don't have any great lanes but I have to draw the right tiles just to be able to get rid of the Q at all. strange.

#note I guess at this rate I might as well have kept the Q

#note I could play VIE, and he most likely has an S by now, but the lONS leave seemed too weak. VIE actually wins by a little bit on a sim, so maybe this was too volatile.

#note welcome back, Q...I considered AXMAN at 12D to give myself a better chance to play the Q, but the more I thought about it the more it seemed like if mike was going to make a comeback it would be by bingoing at the top-right. this also gives me points next turn by hooking AX if he does bingo.

#note looking at this bag, the only possibility I could see that looked scary was the possibility of Mike having RECOUPE, so I figured I had to block 8B. shockingly, quackle actually agrees with me, and it turns out that is the only bingo in the bag. quackle also comes up with SAW at 7A which accomplishes the same thing and keeps JUN for next turn, but this works.

#note his best play by a long way is MERGEE at O2, surprisingly - it blocks my scoring plays and leaves 2 outs
>JD: CLOPRSY N5 SCR.P +33 410
#note right spot but SCRIP at N5 nets me 20 extra spread points because he has to block MOLY.
