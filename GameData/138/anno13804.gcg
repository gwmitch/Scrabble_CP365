#note Tasha's Endgame Misadventures - Episode 7.   Exchanging a single tile on an opening rack is not very Tasha-like.    I will almost always play LINTED in a situation like this, but I wanted to try something different.  Unsurprisingly, exch N sims best.

>Tasha: DEILLNT F8 .LL +5 5
#note I suck for not drawing a bingo.  I almost exchanged the L, but changed my mind.  Then I thought of just playing off a single L, but since I missed my last fish I thought fishing off two tiles instead of one is best.  For what it's worth, ILL is Q's top play.

>Tasha: CDEINNT J3 INDEC.NT +65 70
#note I spent about a minute trying to figure out if I should play INCENTED or INDECENT.  Then I realized it doesn't matter and it's the placement that's important.  
>Andrew: EIRRTVW H8 .VERWRIT +104 218
#note Phony.  I didn't even look twice at it.  Probably because I know OUTWRIT is good.  
>Tasha: AEIKSSU 7F KA +18 88
#note Right word, wrong spot.  I saw the spot at I3, but I must have forgotten about it as I was going back and forth between KA and KUE.

>Tasha: ?HIOTTW 14J HOT +27 192
#note I took forever on this rack trying to summon the courage to play WITHOUTS but I chickened out.  I played HOT instead of HOW because I wanted to keep the W for a higher scoring bingo next turn.

#note Sims best, although I had to add it to the list.  I don't even like any of the other options.

>Tasha: ACEEINR O7 NAE +23 363
#note 4G REIN is slightly better.  I didn't see it, but I wouldn't have played it anyway.  I STILL hate plays like that.  Andrew would have simply blocked the spot next turn.  
>Andrew: BD 6I B.D. +7 442
#note Andrew took a while here, trying to figure out a way to block my inevitable bingo.  The spot is actually unblockable, but he need not have worried!  
>Tasha: ACEIORS E3 COIRS +21 384
#note See what had happened was I thought the bag was empty and made a random play to block his outbingo.  I didn't know there was a tile in the bag until Andrew asked me if I wanted the last tile or not.  I told him after the game I would have fished off an O or an I had I been paying attention and stuff.  At C11 since that's the only fish I see now.  Fishing off the O does not prevent DILATION.  I hope I would have realized this.  Quackle suggests fishing off the I instead (good idea) to give me ACEHORS in two spots if Andrew doesn't see TANKA.  If Andrew doesn't see TANKA, I still lose.  By a few points.

#note Best. :D
>Tasha:  (ILN) +6 416
#note Checking the bag in pre-endgame is important!  Wait a minute.  I DID check the bag, but I counted five tiles, not six.  Getting an accurate tile count is important! Okay, this is the last time I'm gonna screw up due to bimboity.  I'm gonna ACE my next games at club!
