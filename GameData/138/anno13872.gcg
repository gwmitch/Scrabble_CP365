#note I didn't get creative enough here, given how ugly LRSU is as a leave I should've been willing to burn the S with LUST...or, most intriguingly, quackle suggests just WEET.

>JD: GILRSUU H3 GURU +8 146
#note I didn't want to give chris cheap points by opening the triple but quackle says it actually doesn't make much of a difference at all. I could also play RUGULOSE at 12B if I somehow saw it but opening a new quadrant of the board should not be my goal at this point. In fact the only reason this placement of GURU doesn't sim worse is because it lets me bingo next turn...oops.

#note I cannot BELIEVE that I missed the spot for my bingo! I guess somehow I was resigned to not getting to bingo after he blocked, but apparently LOANS was just too tough to see...the funny thing is that passing up the bingo does pretty well here on a sim since HERIOTS gives up such huge comebacks, but still! I should find this!

#note I was definitely a little shaken up by realizing that I'd missed the bingo here, but I think I made the right move by playing short

#note I have to block PICTURED, strictly speaking GIBED is my best play here but he could easily miss my best play and think I'm settling for BIG at 13C and block...
