#note kolton gaves me his racks because he is cool
>JD: AHILPSZ E5 HAZ.L +34 34
#note interesting sim results, HAZEL trails PHIZES just barely and IZAR by 2-3 points. IZAR doesn't look very defensive to me but I guess it's better than putting the A next to the TLS, and he might overlap at F6 for lots of chea points.

#note interesting, I would probably just play QI here but it's close on a sim

>Kolton_Koehler: EHKORST 3H KOSHER +47 223
#note nice find, quackle likes OKEH at K2 on a sim but I'm likely to play really defensively next turn and KOSHER sets up a potential hook for the blank at 2H

#note tricky play, quackle doesn't like my choice, and now I prefer FLUE at I9 which was my other main option...FOU, which wins the sim, just seems to volatilize the board in a way that will be hard to contain later on. but that said it scores more and wins the sim pretty handily, so maybe I'm thinking about this play the wrong way.

>JD: DIOOOTY O6 TOYO +44 394
#note I'm lucky that I have this good of a comeback, but actually I didn't think of OOTID, which keeps the potentially more useful Y...but actually I like taking the points here.

#note unwin
>JD: ?DEILOR 15H .ROlLIED +77 471
#note did not see dolerite with 3 overlaps. a quackle sim actually likes playing ILKA at H1 since he really can't catch me no matter what and I might be able to get more points by bingoing out. this level of evilness did not occur to me. but in practice he will block some of those bingos with his next play, so I think taking the bingo now is better.
