#note This seems as reasonable as anything to me.  There is no killer play, so this early in the game it makes sense to maximize bingo chances.  Also, it's hard for him to score much without opening the board more for me.

>Dave_Koenig: AIMNORT 9H TORMINA +67 81
#note Close call on the placement here.  7H gives big J or Z plays at N6, but this makes the 8L-8O spot more dangerous.

#note This is an interesting moment.  I have no bingo, and though bingos are still possible, the board is a bit tricky.  Also, there are still both blanks and a generally good tile pool unseen.  It does not make sense to fish here.  Better to score what I can and hope to get to those blanks first.  I would have liked to play something like SATI B1, but it gives up too much at A4-A8.  This play, on the other hand, scores even more, grabs an extra tile from the bag, and doesn't give anything back on A5.  All of these things advantages seemed more important than the downside of the two I leave.  However, if I had known STEIL#, I could have done the same thing with a stronger leave.  That's my favorite play here.

#note I was down to seconds left here, ad Phil had probably a minute or two.  I couldn't possibly work out all the possible bingos and the outcomes afterward, and had to just go with something in a hurry.  However, there are many bingos that guarantee victory, but this is not one of them.  If I draw J, N, or U, EXIT 15A will narrowly win.  And on the D draw, EXIT will tie.
