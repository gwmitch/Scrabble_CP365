>Matthew_Larocque: AIMNRRT -R +0 0
#note I thought I was being silly here, but it seems about equal with MARTIN for 22. 
>Settles: BEY H7 BEY +16 16
#note I have 14 written down here....
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIMNRT 8A MARINAT. +83 83
#note Thought there was a small chance they could challenge the sevens, but I'm not going to drop the points for it.
>Settles: DEX I8 DEX +30 46
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HKOOST D4 HOOK.eST +78 161
#note Scored 76.
>Settles: EINW -  +0 46
#note The Settles always try to jokingly read my face to see if I am playing a phony, and I usually just laugh no matter what I played... like here.
>Matthew_Larocque: FGLPRVZ 5B GL.P +14 175
#note Not the most flexible post-bingo draw... I chose to keep the F although can't remember why now. Was kind of hoping to play ZA(S) or (A)DZ next turn if I'm lucky.
>Settles: EINW J9 WINE +29 75
>Matthew_Larocque: ADFRRVZ F8 .DZ +33 208
#note This spot sets up a counter play, but I don't have an E so I don't know why I would do that. Sim likes the two Z(A)RF plays more than I thought it would.
>Settles: DDEU 13J DUDE +21 96
>Matthew_Larocque: AFJORRV B2 FRA. +16 224
#note Missed FJOR(D), ran out of ideas so played this. It sets up JO, but I must not have been even aware of that? Lol.
>Settles: AFO 6H OAF +23 119
>Matthew_Larocque: JOOQRVY B7 V.RY +18 242
#note JO....
>Settles: CU 3A C.U +10 129
>Matthew_Larocque: AJOOQRT 14M TAJ +22 264
#note Kind of a stupid gamble, there's still 3 Os and other plays like HA(J)I and PU(J)A. And RAJ leaves TO to play underneath.
>Settles: EGIINRT 5I TIERING +73 202
>Matthew_Larocque: ?LOOOQR 15N LO +35 299
>Settles: AILR O5 .LAIR +18 220
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EOOQRV -  +0 299
#note Idiotic challenge, too long since this word came up, and I paid for it.
>Settles: EINOPST L4 P.OTEINS +72 292
#note If I had just played Q(I) they cannot bingo. Seriously. I'm so silly sometimes.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EOOQRV 8N Q. +11 310
>Settles: EHN 11D .HEN +28 320
#note That's my fault too.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEOORV E11 .OVE +10 320
#note Trying to get clever, forgetting the L hook completely.
>Settles: EU 4D .UE +10 330
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEIORW 15D WREAk +44 364
#note Tough call but a 30 point lead seemed like a lot on this board - not waiting to see if they have the L.
>Settles: EST A1 SE.T +29 359
#note Scored 28.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGIOO 13B OGI.E +18 382
#note Guess I missed BOOGIE for 37.
>Settles: ACILNSU M3 CA.N +18 377
#note They missed A(N)IS and A(N)US for 27.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABIMO 12M MOB +15 397
#note They cannot go out, so I should play OBIA 3F leaving (E)M for 21. I wanted to do this but I never track in casual games... sigh... maybe I should for practice. MOB plays for 17 too.
>Settles: ILSU K11 UL. +14 391
#note They should play the S since I'm going out.
>Matthew_Larocque: AI 14A AI +8 405
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IS) +4 409
#note A lot of really bad decisions this game.... it really should not have been close.
