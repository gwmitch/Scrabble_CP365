#note RYND definitely looks better than this, but I didn't see the word. Looking between RYND and POD E2, it's harder to say what's best. POD is more of a waiting play. It keeps a good leave which could even draw a bingo, and Jesse can't do much about potential openings I can make next turn. He also might open the board on this next play. On the other hand, RYND isn't terribly easy to block, and any row 8 plays open a couple lanes and still leave me more places to open on the board. It also goes for the SSSS? still out. I like RYND. This is a pretty poor play.

>JD: AELRRUZ 9L LEZ +25 263
#note I whiffed on AZURE 9I which should be better even though it doesn't block YARDS. AZURE already cuts noah's bingo percentage to 16% (versus 13% after LEZ) and it scores so much more and keeps a better leave such that I have a better chance of outrunning noah if he does bingo.
>Noah: EIILNPS 10F SPLENII +65 231
>JD: ?ALNRRU 11I RUN +14 277
#note this is a little bit of a gamble since he now bingoes 12% of the time versus 1% after ARUM at the top-right, and the board is so closed that I might have a hard time getting my bingo down. playing ARUM and waiting for him to open is probably safer.
>Noah: AELOSTW N9 .EALOT +34 265
#note sI forgot the WEDGY hook again! JOW E6 is a very good play here. I think it's actually possible that ZEALOT is best here, though. It really depends what he has. RUN is a hard play to figure out and it depends how aggressively I think Jesse will play here. Is he aggressive enough to make the play without an S or blank? Probably not. But I think he would play it without the blank, keeping say EIRS. RUN suggests one point tiles, probably with an S, maybe with a D, G, or M in the leave somewhere. If he has the blank, I think I'm screwed whether I play JOW or ZEALOT. If he doesn't, JOW gives me some chances to bingo and lock up the rest of the options, and the lane he just opened isn't trivial to block. Though it doesn't grab at the blank like ZEALOT does, I think JOW might be the better option if Jesse is blank-less, and certainly helps my spread more if he has the blank. JOW looks like it is probably the play.

#note Not positive this is the right rack, but I'm pretty sure.
>JD: AADEFGI O12 AG +15 379
#note the F seemed like it would be more useful if he bingoed with VIROSES or something. Even if I just take the points for AGAMID I think I still outrun all of his bingoes except for GROOVES.
