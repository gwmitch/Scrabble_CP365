#note Should probably just play my D here too, most responses post-WYTE are going to mess with my ability to hook it next turn.

>Will: AACDERT 3I CRA.E +20 38
#note What a mess...I could sit and stare at positions like these forever. I knew the shorter plays would sim well but I wanted to get some consistent scoring going. I really should play 9G AD.

#note Ooh, CY(MARS). N5 SYNC is interesting too, with very few plays that can hurt me through the C still available.
>Diane: ?BDEIOS F1 DISrOBE +71 320
#note Whoa, N8 BEDSONIA for 102! Guess SYNC would block something like that. Can't say I even remotely thought of that overlappy area as a bingo line.
