#note Debated between SUM, SUB, and BULLWHIP. I didn't really appreciate how bad the lack of remaining E's was for my bingo chances. I told Winter postgame about BULLWHIP and I think he indicated his rack was poor enough on this turn that the extra points would've been tough to overcome. Also, SUM seems to outdo SUB significantly.
