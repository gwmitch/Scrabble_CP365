#note only bingo available, nice find by Wayne
>Josh: AINPRTT 4H PAINT +30 171
#note This may have been a mistake, with H1 TINP(O)T available. I missed that. TARP(O)N isn't worth the 3 extra points, but TINP(O)T may be.

#note Happy to know this was not a word. RETABLE is a noun!
>Josh: ARRRVWX 8A WAX.R +45 264
#note I figured that with BLA(Z)ERED available, there was no issue in giving him RE(A)DABLE. He may miss both. He certainly missed BLAZERED last turn, unless he was unsure of it. With the rack inference, I should probably play VAW 3G keeping RRRX, but what are the chances he sees BLEARED I3 this time? I missed it, and so did he last turn. Sometimes you just can't be sure of what to do with knowledge of your opponent's rack and their imperfect word knowledge, board vision and strategy. That is why Scrabble will never be solved! Mouhahahaha!

#note whoops?
>Josh: EIJNRRV M7 J.N +26 290
#note This was tough, but I think in hindsight I should just take the points for 13A JIVE and create another scoring spot. My RN combo will be useful for later to get ahead with another bingo. The pool isn't bingo-prone. But I think I still prefer this play. Meh.

#note Damn, he just gave me one more point for 6F HAM/HEM. Didn't look for plays until he made his play, so I originally missed the fit. Bad mistake.

>Josh: AABEGRT --  -95 337
#note I wasn't doing too well at 1-2, so I decided to possibly blow another game for the purpose of spread. Looked tough for Wayne to win at this point. I knew this wasn't valid.
>Wayne_Barclay: GO J11 .OG +4 297
>Josh: AABEGRT 13C GETA +19 356
#note BETA is better, but the play to make is 14I RATBAG! Didn't know it.
>Wayne_Barclay: CEENPSV L2 V.. +6 303
#note I think this was his rack, based on what he said. Apparently he should play 2C VEN(D) to keep the best leave.
>Josh: ABIMNRY N10 AMBRY +32 388
#note Blocks all of his bingos, but 13J (G)ABY is better for spread.
