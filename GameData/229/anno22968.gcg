>Josh_Greenway: ABMORRT 8D MORTAR +22 22
#note Running my record to 8-3 puts me at table 1 for this game vs Tim O'Hara Jr who's been cruising (10-1) and has been sitting at table 1 for pretty much the whole turnament (he jokes hat he's even playing on his board since he had set it up there. We had played once previously, at BAT in 2014 - Tim came out on top then, although neither of us could remember who had won back then. I was nervous heading into this game, but glad to score decently onthe opening turn. 
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AJL F6 JA.L +27 27
>Josh_Greenway: BDHISTY I5 HYB.ID +19 41
#note DISHY / (MORTAR)S scores a lot more, but I was happy with this play, keeping ST. Tim remarked he'd never seen anyone play this word before - I agreed - he would then go on to score a bunch of points off if this...
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EEINQU H10 EQUINE +51 78
>Josh_Greenway: ADGORST 12G O.TDRAGS +70 111
#note I go out on a limb here, down 37 points, and put the pressure on by bingoing. Seemed semi-plausible, but I wasn't confident, so when Tim challenged, I was concerned... (oh, and for style points, I could have played GORD(I)TAS for 7 points less - but I didn't see it)
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: AAEIKNU -  +0 78
#note The word was good. Phew! Tim loses this turn on a bad challenge
>Josh_Greenway: ?AABLOV H1 BrAVO +44 155
#note Missed some bingos here: AVOwABL(E), and LAVABO(E)s. I didn't know either, but wanted to push the score and keep the pressure on Tim, so I burn the blank to stretch the leadto 83.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IZ 14F ZI. +32 110
>Josh_Greenway: AADLOTW 15E WAD. +22 177
#note MIssed the best play - OW(T), hooking (J)O and (A)W - but found the second best
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EEEGGPX 13G X. +37 147
#note ouch. with successive Z and X plays, Tim is right back in it, down 36
>Josh_Greenway: ALLNOST 13L LO +12 189
#note SANTALOL is a word? That's nuts. Well that's another missed bingo. At least this LO play is the best non-bingo play available - quackle likes it because of the leave: ALNST
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EEEGGNP -  +0 147
#note exchange-5
>Josh_Greenway: AGILNST 1H .LASTING +86 275
#note I pick up IG and bingo for 85. Now I'm feeling pretty damn lucky. Other bingos that played: SALTING(S), SLATING(S), LASTING(S), TA(B)LINGS, and two more that I had a chance of finding: STA(B)LING and STA(R)LING. Can't believe those first four take S's. Seems like the ING 7s that take an S would be good to study. 
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: EFIRY 14J FIERY +45 192
#note This is a nice play by Tim here for 45 - cutting the lead to 89
>Josh_Greenway: AEENNUW 2H .AW +28 303
#note EEW is the play here, but I either didn't see it or wasn't sure about it. (r)AW is second best. bad leave though
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ?ACFIOT N5 FACTIOn. +66 258
#note Tim is hot on my heels, cutting the lead from 117 to 51
>Josh_Greenway: EEENNRU O8 EN +14 317
#note Feels like I have to take this spot. quackle disagrees, but quackle doesn't play defense
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: DEIV M3 VIED +24 282
#note Tim continues to cut the lead - down to 41
>Josh_Greenway: EEINRUU K7 RUINE. +12 329
#note with this rack, quackle wants an exchange, or for me to play UN(A)U making U(M), N(O) and (U)T. Actually that's a nice play all things considered. I don't see it, so I do my best to play a bunch of tiles, hoping for a better draw
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: CEP 15M PEC +33 315
#note Yikes! With this play, Tim is just 20 behind. But wait - is GORP good? I suspected at the time it was that stuff campers and hikers eat - but I definitely held this play. I couldn't risk a challenge though - so I let it stand. Good thing, as GORP is good.
>Josh_Greenway: AEGLMPU D8 .APLE +18 347
#note Quackle has some much better plays than I make here. I'm just glad to be drawing some tiles worth more than 1.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: HKSU 13B HUSK +32 347
#note Oh God - Tim won't stop scoring big points - the lead is gone - I'm ahead by just 6 and worried about cratering. I track what's left and try to set up the endgame to outrun him. (actually, we undercounted EQUINE by 6 so the game as per quackle is actually tied)
>Josh_Greenway: EEGMRTU 14A UM +22 369
#note Wow, I actually play quackle's top play here. 
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: IN E11 IN. +20 367
#note Tim answers back to trail by 8 (in actuality by 2)
>Josh_Greenway: EEEGORT 3H .GE +18 387
#note So I know Tim's rack now: ENOOST - no bingo chances, no high scoring tiles - so I just need to score. I like my play here, but if I had spent more time I could have played in the same spot for more - with R(A)GE or (A)GER, or better yet, ERG(A)TE (a worker ant - who knew?) or GO(A)TEE. I'm happy to get 18.
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ENOOST 10B TO.S +16 383
>Josh_Greenway: EEORT G6 OR. +16 403
#note This is one of a bunch of plays that score in the 13-17 range, which appers to be enough for the win
>Tim_O'Hara_Jr: ENO O1 .ONE +6 389
#note Tim goes out, and it's a 403-388 (should have been 403-394) win! What a nailbiter! I'm sure I'll see Tim again, as I run my record to 9-3, and he sits at 10-2 now.
