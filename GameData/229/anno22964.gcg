#note I still believe! 2B HOP and POH weren't too appealing because if I'm going to play there at this score, I'd like to threaten a line.
>Rafi: AKO H13 OAK +31 241
>W: ADHIJOV J9 AJI +27 190
#note Not sure DOH or HOD leaving AIJV are getting me anywhere, so I might as well make a play that could be annoying for Rafi without an O.

>W: DEHOOTU B7 ....UTED +36 250
#note Thought for a while about DOUT/DOTH vs EXECUTED - I figured my chances of drawing an S and making a huge HOS/QIS play were decent, and a sufficiently blocky play after DOUT/DOTH would leave me in a bind. 
>Rafi: EINNRRS A11 NINER +28 313
>W: AAEHLOO 2J HO +28 278
#note Made this play kind of fast after seeing the major consonant overload to come, but I missed a killer play that could've been a game changer - 2A ALOHA. Damaging miss.

#note Winning by only 80 points after drawing all four S and both ? is basically a loss, hopefully this result can be overturned soon.
