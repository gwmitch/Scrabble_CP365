#note game 9, and i'm 7-1, and this is my draw. surely, this tournament is mine to win. surely this won't be the first out of 6 losses in a row, right? it is extremely important that i find plays like vOTABLE.  however quackle likes my bingo best for some reason. dumbckle.

>seth: ABLRTUY L3 BUTYRAL +94 180
#note that's a nice play, but it's pretty ridiculous.
>cesar: ADHNNOW 9C DOWN +21 127
#note a few plays sim better like HWAN M1, WHOM/WHAM at I2, M2 NAH, NOH. i saw all those but wanted to try to get lucky with my A. -7 HWAN is great because of the leave and score mostly and i should have thought harder.

#note my only chance to do anything.  -5 because of 2D TEGUA though. (although he's not going to open, maybe i'm also blocking the J?)
