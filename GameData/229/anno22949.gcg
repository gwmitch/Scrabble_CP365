#note One thing I love about the NOLA tournaments is getting to hang out with the Durbin brothers - Harry and Larry. These guys are great - and if you ever get a chance to sit with them at a hotel bar, or head out to the casino with them - do it, you'll have a great time! Before this game, I played Larry and lost at the 2014 NOLA event. As for this opening play, quackle strongly believes I should exchange - keeping AIST or AST. I don't have many opening play exchange - something I should think about.

#note quackle thinks I should play another bingo and hook it under goo - although I don't know the bingos it wants me to play: RADIAnS, AcARIDS, ARAmIDS, cARDIAS.

#note If I knew WITED, I would have played it - I'm happy with WINED
>Larry_Durbin: EQTU B10 QU.TE +68 136
#note ouch! 68 point non-bingo puts Larry right back in this one!
>Josh_Greenway: HLMOTTX A14 OX +29 178
#note I really like quackle's play of LOX (making (TA)X(I)) but didn't see it

#note quackle likes WILL much better than WALL and I agree. Not sure why I played wall.

#note not an impressive play
>Larry_Durbin: CEJOPRU F2 JO +28 223

#note I'm dying to get rid of A's vs I's - should have been MINK instead of MARK

#note Exchange all 7 - This is my first exchange in SEVEN games - that doesn't seem like a good idea - never mind that quackle wants nothing to do with an exchange at this point. I guess I'm looking at tiles like SSZ? in the bag - but with a 15 point lead, seems like poor timing
>Larry_Durbin: HO G2 OH +29 294
#note Larry takes the lead with this play, but it's pretty dangerous. I've just exchanged 7 tiles and there are a couple of dangerous hooks available in the bag...
>Josh_Greenway: DEEIPRS 1G PRESIDE +94 374
#note I am a luck bag
>Larry_Durbin: ?ESYZ 15K ZEStY +57 351
#note 57 points here - but Larry will still trail by 23
>Josh_Greenway: INOORTU 10B .UIT +20 394
#note Best play I could come up with (T)UTOR parallel underneath WINED would have been a beautiful find... I'm ahead by 43 and feeling confident - I have him tracked to ABCI
>Larry_Durbin: ABCI 3M CA. +22 373
>Josh_Greenway: NOOR 2I NO +10 404
#note there seem to be better plays than this, but my tracking says he'll play out with (N)IB and I win by 8. That's what happened and this was a fun game for sure. Thanks Larry!
