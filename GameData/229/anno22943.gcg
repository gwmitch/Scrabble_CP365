>Peggy_Altazan: AIIL H8 ILIA +8 8
>Josh_Greenway: AAELMOQ 10G Q. +11 11
#note quackle doesn't like this (it prefers plays like AMOLE, LOAM, and ALAMO, none of which I know. Meanwhile, I'm hoping to draw a T or blank. This is my first game playing Peggy, who at this point I have heard is super, super nice. Since this game, I can confirm this assessment
>Peggy_Altazan: ELOTW 12D TOWEL +24 32
#note I don't really know ILIAL, but I'm not going to challenge. I may have held here for a minute. I always worry in a situation like this that holding on a word she probably knows 100% makes me look dumb, but what the hell
>Josh_Greenway: AAAELMO 11D AMA +25 36
#note Alamo superior if I knew it, Ama fine for me
>Peggy_Altazan: ETV 13C VET +20 52
>Josh_Greenway: AELORYZ G6 AZO +24 60
#note I don't hate this play as much as I probably should, dropping that A in from of the triple letter. ZOEAL/L(AMA) is way better
>Peggy_Altazan: GKOR F3 GROK +35 87
#note damn triple letter
>Josh_Greenway: EEGLRTY 3C YEG. +18 78
#note I was really happy I saw this, as I saw it on a list just th day before. I was really unhappy a second later when I realized LEG(G)Y was a way better play
>Peggy_Altazan: DEEINNP 4F .EPINNED +78 165
#note I held on this for a long time I think, even though it made sense to me. Those RE- and -ER bingos can be so tricky. This puts me down 87, so I'm getting worried.
>Josh_Greenway: ABEFLRT H1 FLA. +27 105
#note quackle wants me to play FAB, leaving ELRT which appears to be a pretty good leave. Problem is, I hate L's. Watch what happensin two turns to see why I should listen to quackle more often
>Peggy_Altazan: EX 4C EX +41 206
#note gulp. down by 101
>Josh_Greenway: BDEEIRT B4 DEBITER +79 184
#note missed I(N)TERBED. Played my phony DEBITER instead. I pretty much knew this was a phony, but down 101 I know I have to start to get creative. Peggy accepts - know idea whether she had doubts - but she had a play lined up that cancels out my play
>Peggy_Altazan: ?EILNOS 1H .ELONIeS +83 289
#note this was disappointing, going from down 22 to down 105. I'm definitely stressing at this point
>Josh_Greenway: AAEENSY A8 AYE +31 215
#note quackle agrees this is the obvious best play, with a decent leave
>Peggy_Altazan: AHR 2B RAH +31 320
>Josh_Greenway: AEENSUV 14E AVENUES +76 291
#note Hey I've drawn a bingo! But I have no where to play it. I know, I'll make up a phony hook! I'm closing the gap. She accepts the play with no fuss, compliments me, and now I'm thinking, maybe MOTA is good? It sort of sounds good? Have I seen it before? 
>Peggy_Altazan: NNU 15G NUN +19 339
>Josh_Greenway: BCCIORT E5 BOCCI +37 328
#note Holy cow, quackle agrees with me again! Did I know if this was good? Not really! I've closed to within 11 at this point. Feeling optimistic!
>Peggy_Altazan: ADRSW 15A DRAWS +46 385
#note Oh boy. Moment of truth time. I made up MOTA, right? It can't be good! Or can it? I'm holding a 44 point play following this, so I'm still in it if I let it stay on the board. But if I challenge and MOTAS is good, then I'm a total idiot. Actually, if I leave it on the board without challenging, and it's no good, I'm a SUPER idiot. This right here is the famouse Mike Wise move that he loved to play on people. I should challenge just because of that! Hmm. I hold for probably 3-4 minutes as I think about it. I can make 44 points and will still hold an S. I can't believe I'm doing this... but... accept? I accept the play. And it's no good, of course. I PHONIED MYSELF!!!
>Josh_Greenway: FHMORST 13I FROTH +44 372
#note Here's my 44 point play to keep me withing 13 points. 
>Peggy_Altazan: JU L11 JU. +20 405
>Josh_Greenway: DGIMSTT 3L MITT +22 394
#note Oh god. I miss MIDST. It's right in my MIDST but I don't find it! Man, I'm terrible at this. Instead I keep that spot open and open the triple line because I know there's a P and some 1 point tiles left (and a blank).
>Peggy_Altazan: ?IIOOPR N10 POIs +22 427
#note Ugh. This play kills me. I'm 99% sure both are good, but decide to challenge anyway, just in case. I'm hating myself. And I can;t wait to check to see if MOTAS is no good.
>Josh_Greenway: DGSU -  +0 394
#note My bad challenge of POIs/FROTHs loses me this turn
>Peggy_Altazan: IOR M1 .R.. +5 432
>Josh_Greenway: DGOS O9 GODS +17 411
#note Well, I phonied my way back into this game, but phonied myself right out of it at the end. So sad. After a 3-1 start, I'm now at 3-2. Man, I wish I could have a doover. Wait, is doover good?
