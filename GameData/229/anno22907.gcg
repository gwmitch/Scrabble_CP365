#note Not happy to close the board at a deficit but it goes hardest for blanks and scores. Will have to open later.

#note quackle likes TE or DE at 4L, very nice! it's also sneaky because he might think i'm going for a bingo. I was too focused on blocking the only lane. -11.5

#note The crux of this game, from my end. O1 OXID, DOUX, or DOXY? OXID seemed like it would invite Cesar to make an easy move that would score and close down the board in a damaging way, whereas DOUX invites him to either play to the X in a way that should hopefully give me counterplay, or leave it and allow me to make my own volatile opening at some point.

#note FAX sucks. 13B MUST is nice and 6B FAST sims best. i don't honestly understand how to justify this play, but it's been 10 years and i'm seemingly never going to stop making plays like this. i may need to play more in person and/or online games, or speed games for decision making, etc. this might just be a matter of making the most decisions per day i can.

#note E6 TAB is cool! it's by far the best play here. damn!! -8

#note vill anderson

(vill says: the board is so hideous for bingos and the pool is so good...)
>cesar: AENSSTT 1M TAS +28 359
#note maybe i can keep that open and play E5 STAB?
>will: ?ACIINT 10D .I +13 380
#note Not sure about this...hoping to pounce on any openings Cesar makes.
>cesar: EINRRST 13C .SE +20 379
#note i think i need to play 6C ERN or 6D IN and let him figure out how best to block it. it may be difficult. (maybe not, something like CEE C5 kills ERN pretty quickly), or 5C TO for IN. ugh.
>will: ?ACINNT 9C N. +3 383
#note I have ANA-hooking bingos with everything except the T and hopefully if he blocks I can out-in-two with relative ease.
>cesar: EINORRT 6B TORN +11 390
#note i may have a chance with this if i can go out (where though). maybe 6C RIN?
