#note definitely a mistake, should excahnge and leave the strongest possible response rack. TROPIN is a nice strong leave, especially for 8s.

>JD: BEINNRT K5 BRIN +18 28
#note BINE must be the play, too easy for her to score on row 8 otherwise. I didn't like the NRT leave that much but beggars can't be choosers!

#note she's just shown a really strong leave on a pretty closed board. with that in mind, I'm not playing OY at L4.  quackle thinks the strong leave after YOU is worth sacrificing a few points for - especially with the R and the B to bingo through.

#note I desperately need to hit a bingo on column O, so I'm not blocking just for 15 extra points. there are so few Os left that quackle likes OKA at 4F which also sets up a better 7s lane. this sims about even!
>Lisa_Odom: BIJ E3 JIB. +26 270
>JD: AAEGLPS D12 GA.A +20 224
#note AGAPES gets me within 15 points - probably a shot worth taking at this point.

#note all of a sudden things look pretty bad again. really I need to draw the blank to win most likely. a bit frustrating that I have so many letters that go after the X and no scoring play! Q likes exchanging down to the R to maximize chances of drawing a blank (4 more Es left).
>Lisa_Odom: ?DEELSY 10I DEnSELY +75 389
#note ah, well, that's that
>JD: DEEGRTW M9 W.DGE +28 312
#note there are no esses remaining so I basically need to bingo to the E on row 2.

#note the right fish! (going for EMIGRATE) but I lose no matter what basically

>JD: AEGIIRT 7M GI +22 344
#note AEGIRITE FOR THE WIN!!!!!!4! ok I guess not. TRIAGE first because otherwise she plays KAMI/MICE first to block my best out.
