>Jonathan_Lindh: IKLOPUU -UKLOPU +0 0
#note I didn't record my rack because it was that dreadful. I exchange 6. I think I kept an E.
>Ken_Dutch: CDEENOS I8 SECONDE +75 97
#note Best play for Ken! IT BEGINS!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGILOZ 15E GLOZE +56 56
#note GLOZE is a verb Jon! Which means you should be playing GLOZED 15D for 69. -12.1
>Ken_Dutch: AH J13 AH +29 126
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIKOSVX K11 VID +19 75
#note He blocked a big X play so I didn't know what to do. 9F VIDEO for 25? I decided to go for a DADO setup even though Quackle says -8.4

#note M13 SYN for 31! Blocks his bingo too! Was this game winnable after all! -11.7
>Ken_Dutch: AABNRST N8 RATSBAN. +74 245

>Jonathan_Lindh: EEMSTTX O8 EX +42 165
#note 3rd best play! HOW DO I MISS 8K EXERT! It leaves MST and LOOKS AWESOME! -19
>Ken_Dutch: ACEF M7 CAFE +38 283

>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIMSTT O12 EM +14 179

>Ken_Dutch: AEINRST C9 RATINES +71 380
#note I mean, come on!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?EEISTT 8L T... +5 203
#note There's not even a playable bingo with these tiles. I'll fish for one.
>Ken_Dutch: HOW B12 HOW +35 415
#note This is getting ridiculous.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEEIST K3 AErIEST +67 270
#note SERIATE and IDEATES on the triple line! I wasn't in the state of mind to find those simple yet great bingos. This was the next best one along wth a few others. -20
>Ken_Dutch: DILU 5I LU.ID +5 420
#note This seemed like a strange play but maybe his rack stunk. Maybe he wanted to block additional bingos. I don't know.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DFGIRTU L4 F.D +27 297
#note 4th best play! TRIFID for 37 at L1 YES YES YES. -4.9
>Ken_Dutch: LMU I3 MU.L +9 429
>Jonathan_Lindh: AGIRRTU A10 RUG +15 312
#note There's stupid 9E GRIPE again! I like my play better has it offers a better leave and more importantly blocks HIS bingos and high scoring J plays on the triple. I'm down 100000 bajillion points and I'M blocking! -.5 to Quackle but this is the right call.
>Ken_Dutch: AIV H1 VIA +22 451
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIIOORT A14 OI +12 324
#note What's the right sequence here? He has J plays in one of 2 places so I'm just going for an out in two. OI and RATIO seems like a fine enough endgame. Maybe there's something better? Ideas?
>Ken_Dutch: ?JOPRTU B6 JUPe +29 480
#note He needed to play this at G3 for 12 more points. He wondered after the game why he didn't do this.
>Jonathan_Lindh: AIORT C2 RATIO +19 343
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (ORT) +6 349
#note Ken didn't record his score right as he lost a turn somewhere. If I had gotten 25 more spread points and won the class prize, I would feel dirty as I probably shouldn't have won it due to opponent scoring errors. I don't think this game was winnable, but it should have been 60 or so points closer. This was my last loss of the tournament.
