#note Interesting rack. I liked QI for defense and it sims best, then FIZ, ZIP, and ZAX. Briefly considered some weird placements but didn't mess around with that - though now looking more closely at QI with Q on the star, which sims dead even with normal QI. Pretty cool - placements of IN or IT at 9H would give back a nice Z play at 7I, and if Bill plays at 7I I could get a big play at 6J.

#note Very close with FAZE/FOLIO. My play retains that for next turn while setting up an alternative spot for the F. What's your preference?

#note awkward rack. ROTARY at B5 is an option, but it could give back a lot of points. KYAR B6 looks pretty good too.
>bill_clark: DE F5 ED +19 250
>cecilia: HMORRTT D3 MOTH +31 429
#note THROAT at 15K is nice, but MOTH kills the threat of EPICURE, PRECISE, and a few other things at 3A. There are also 8s available, e.g. EARPIECE, CAUSERIE, FURPIECE (!!), but they are fewer and more difficult to find.

#note Oops, my play is CEP C2. Lazy.
