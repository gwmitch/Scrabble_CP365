>Mike_Frentz: MNOR 8E NORM +12 12
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 19: Time to take out another juggernaut. Mike was rated over 2000 headed into the tournament. He originally played MORN but switched it to NORM. I'm not sure which is better, but NORM does allow for a more dynamic board.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEOOPW 7F WOO +19 19
#note 2nd best play! PEARWOOD! Darn it darn it darn it! -16.9
>Mike_Frentz: DORT 6G TROD +17 29
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGHIP K5 HEAPInG +104 123
#note Best play! I may miss. I just generally don't miss twice in a row. One of my favorite plays of the tournament.
>Mike_Frentz: NORTU 8J U.TORN +27 56
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEEIQR L4 QI +27 150
#note Best play!
>Mike_Frentz: DLW M7 W.LD +13 69
>Jonathan_Lindh: ABEEERR D7 BEARER +26 176
#note Best play!
>Mike_Frentz: ANSTY 13B NASTY +25 94
>Jonathan_Lindh: AADEEFV B10 VEE.A +32 208
#note I THINK this was my rack but not sure. If so, FAENA also scores similar but I prefer this since it doesn't open up a great line. I up by a ton, no need to get greedy.
>Mike_Frentz: HRSY 11A H.R.SY +24 118
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFFITU N3 DUFFE. +26 234
#note 5th best play! I was attempting to close lines, get turnover, and free myself of a U, but M3 FID seems a touch better. On second thought, I may do my play again. -2.7, but maybe not.
>Mike_Frentz: IK 9F KI +22 140
>Jonathan_Lindh: EGINTUZ A14 NU +8 242
#note Mike's fishing scares me. I think its acceptable to deviate from standard equity play to rid myself of a U, shut down a key line, and keep the Z for future scoring. My play is just fine.
>Mike_Frentz: EEIILNV 7B LI. +6 146
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEGITXZ 8A ZA +35 277
#note Sure enough, my strategy worked. Quackle likes XI for some reason here, but I STRONGLY disagree.
>Mike_Frentz: EIT O1 TIE +12 158
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGIITX 1N I. +2 279
#note Well since Mike isn't scoring much and can only with a bingo, and I have an extra I...
>Mike_Frentz: OU F13 .OU +8 166
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEGINTX 15D EX.DING +51 330
#note Best play! I bated Mike into a huge mistake since he needed to open the closed board to win.
>Mike_Frentz: EEILSST 12G TELESIS +79 245
#note I held. I held for a very long time. A large part of me says challenge but then I think why would a 2000 player phony on you? 22 spread points between Jon and $250. Challenging this bingo makes the difference. I thought HEAPINGS* was new.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ?AEGLTV 14J ALiVE +23 353
#note 14J AGLET was the play I wanted. D3 TALEBEARERS for 26? Won't know that one!
>Mike_Frentz: ABJ 6A JAB +23 268
#note I considered blocking that spot, but then I wondered if the J might still be in the bag. It wasn't.
>Jonathan_Lindh: GIMOOPT 5B GOOP +24 377
#note I made the best equity play but I think there are better endgame sequences than mine. Here we go! 5B TOPOI for 23 leaving GM is the play I should make. Mike will do CACAO for less and then I go out with GEM. This was a badly played endgame and this endgame alone may have been worth 22 points. EXCLUDING HEAPINGS*!
>Mike_Frentz: AACCEN D1 CACA. +24 292
#note Bad bad Jon!
>Jonathan_Lindh: IMT 3B MI. +14 391
#note I10 MILT, H10 ITEM! This was the return of MR. -999.9 ENDGAME MAN!
>Mike_Frentz: EN 2A NE +12 304
>Mike_Frentz:  (T) +2 306
#note I coulda, I woulda, I shoulda.
