>Jesse_Day: AAQRRSS -AQRS +0 0
#note NOLA Scrabble: Episode 2: Jesse posted his version so I'll jack his racks and elaborate. This is -.1 for him as Q likes keeping an extra S. Tossup.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIINYZ 8F ZEIN +26 26
#note 3rd best play! Jesse says YEZ is right and Q agrees. I probably do mine again because I don't like leaving an A hook I don't have onto AZINE or an O hook I don't have onto OYEZ while keeping double I's. JD: Jonathan thought about this for a long while. YEZ looks worthwhile.
>Jesse_Day: AACFHRS 9E CAF +32 32
#note CAF, HAAF, or FAH? Jesse thought I had an X so he played defensively. I did not have the X.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EEIOSTY E9 .OY +16 42
#note 2nd bst play! He also blocked OYEZ with his play so I do COY and try and fish. I do it again over J5 OYES which I don't like.
>Jesse_Day: AHNRSST 10D H.ST +29 61
#note Jesse's play is listed as 3rd best but probably best from a defensive point of view. HANTS and HARTS at 12A are marginally above but give a lot back. Jesse makes a good call here.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEEISTT H7 T.E +12 54
#note 3rd best play! I miss INSETTED and DINETTES each for 62. I ALWAYS miss this pair. -28
>Jesse_Day: ABINRRS F5 BRA... +19 80
#note Best play for Jesse!
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEIOSTU J5 OUTSIDE +78 132
#note Best play! I thought about the other positions, but I liked the board dynamics with this play. I turning over 7 and may draw a blank.
>Jesse_Day: AIINRRS D10 .AIR +19 99
#note Best play for Jesse!
>Jonathan_Lindh: CEIMORW K3 MOW +26 158
#note Best play!
>Jesse_Day: GINPRSU 12H PURSING +85 184
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh: ACDEIOR 3G RACE.OID +84 242
#note Best play! This or COADMIRE in the same spot and for the amount. This isn't as volatile as COADMIRE which I like. I almost tried CORREIDA* at A13 but wisely thought the better of it.
>Jesse_Day: ?AAGKPT 2M PAK +28 212
#note Jesse considered KAPA at C12 which would have been more aggressive. Given what I picked up next, he should have. His play of PAK  appears to be best according to Quackle.
>Jonathan_Lindh: EELLLNR H1 LE.L +15 257
#note Best play! No, this wasn't a typo. I did pick up 3 L's. I almost played the phony PELL* for 18 but decided against it.
>Jesse_Day: ?AAGJOT E2 JOTA +30 242
#note Another best play out of Jesse!
>Jonathan_Lindh: AEILNRV N5 RAVELIN. +66 323
#note Another best play out of me!
>Jesse_Day: ?AAEGLO M9 AGO.AL +24 266
#note Quackle apparently likes C11 GOA better but I strongly disagree. This is fricking brilliant. Cuts the volatility of the O8 spot while blocking my X bomb there. 
>Jonathan_Lindh: DDIMOUX 13G DIM +22 345
#note Tricky situation. My play is back aways but still good. I considered 13F OXIM which is Quackle's 2nd best EX N8 to take out the triple. With 2 blanks unseen, the HAIR line needs to be cut off. The X should be retained for scoring. And no Quackle, I am not doing 14J MOULD after Jesse's last play!
>Jesse_Day: ?BEEEHO O8 HEBE +54 320
#note Best play! Well Jesse DID have a blank! He just had a 3 E's to go with it. Worst case scenario for me on this play and another great find by Jesse.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIORTUX L3 .X +36 381
#note Best play! There's my X for scoring!
>Jesse_Day: ?EENOQS 4A QuES. +46 366
#note Quackle likes fishing off the Q at 12C from an equity perspective, but Jesse needs to score and go for the win. This is the best because Jesse can still win if he hits things just right.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DIORTTU A4 .UITTOR +48 429
#note Best play! Jesse's play saves my bacon as Matt Dewaelesche would say! I'm not guaranteed a win. Note how much this play scores with my letters and how it cuts down on his bingo percentage with a blank out.
>Jesse_Day: EEINNOV H12 ..NE +18 384
#note PION is better than PINE here. VOILE is just a sure loss Quackle. Jesse explained why in his version.
>Jonathan_Lindh: DEFGNUW 15D FUDG. +14 443
#note As Jesse said, I was playing it safe here because I knew Jesse had a blank and I only knew 5 of his tiles. FUGLED 14J is 38 and gets me a bunch of spread. If I played that, Jesse probably plays ENVOY B10 for 30 and I got out win WEN C3 for 12 getting an I off of his rack. That sequence nets me +22. My sequence nets me +9. -13 for this endgame in total. Not quite Mr. -999.9 point endgame man, but I need to play these endgames better. -13
>Jesse_Day: ?EINOVY 14J VOI.E +32 416
#note 14J VOLLEY is Jesse's play here but he was overtime already.
>Jonathan_Lindh: ENW B9 WEN +17 460
#note Best play!
>Jonathan_Lindh:  (NY?) +10 470
#note Final score recorded as 470-406 because Jesse went over by 40 seconds or so. This was a very well played game on my part. Over half of my lost equity came on the DINETTES/INSETTED miss. Another 13 came in the endgame. Everything else was just about perfect. It seemed Jesse and I traded best plays constantly throughout this game. Glad to know I can compete with the best.
