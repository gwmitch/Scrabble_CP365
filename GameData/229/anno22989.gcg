>Matthew_Larocque: HINNRTZ 8F NTH +12 12
#note NINTH obviously. I can't throw away 12 points.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EEJ 7E JEE +16 16
#note At least I didn't help her much. Supposedly she has never seen anyone play NTH before.
>Matthew_Larocque: GILNNRZ 6G GRIZ +38 50
#note A good time to have recalled the newly added GRIZ, I would have hated to have missed that here.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ?AEGNRS 9H ANGlERS +64 80
#note She played this pretty much instantly, very odd that she blanked on both AJEE and HEARINGS/HEARSING.
>Matthew_Larocque: BELNNOP 8L PEON +38 88
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EMM 10F MEM +21 101
>Matthew_Larocque: BELNSUY 11D BUY +23 111
#note I didn't know NEBULY!
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ANW 12C WAN +22 123
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILLNS 13D AINSELL +67 178
#note Okay well, I played this without even noticing I could also hook WAN, so I guess I must be half asleep too. They both give back points, so I should just take the 75?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ADR H12 D.AR +21 144
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIIOT H1 GOITE. +24 202
#note I don't need to open so much, but I have to take these points right?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ASS D7 AS +14 158
#note I wonder what she had, because based on her next rack, she must have either missed bingos, or a high scoring play like VISES/SWAN.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIIIOT 4D IDIO. +12 214
#note Passed on 14J IDIOT, because it gives her a lot of points in return. 
>Marilyn_Wilkins: EEILRSV B6 RELIVES +77 235
#note Oh right you can put an S on WAN. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEHIOT A1 HOgTIED +88 302
#note Not quite, I can scored 97 here with better word knowledge.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: OW B1 OW +25 260
>Matthew_Larocque: DNOOOQT 10J OOT +16 318
#note Yikes. This is tricky. I have enough open Is that I can afford to keep the Q without worry. ONO C1 scores 2 more and still leaves me with two Q dumps.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AFKL 3C FLAK +33 293
>Matthew_Larocque: ACDNOQY 5D NOD +27 345
#note I'm playing with fire now. There are 3 Us left, so there's a pretty good chance I draw at least one of them. That made me feel better about taking the points here, but I still felt uneasy about putting off the Q. There's always a chance it will screw me over.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AEFIPRT 15C FIRET.AP +64 357
#note Play with fire, fall into a firetrap! A clutch find by Marilyn, though. Should have been the game winning play.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACQRTUY J1 QUART. +26 371
#note My entire logic for playing this was that I thought I could play *QUARTZY next turn to cheese out extra points. Q thinks it's terrible though and sims (PET)TY highest at 59% to win vs 46% for QUART(Z). I guess I'm supposed to block huge AX plays forming lOX?
>Marilyn_Wilkins: ABCEIUX M5 CUB.. +12 369
#note She wanted to stop me from playing C(OS)Y, which I saw as an alternate play to *(QUARTZ)Y.
>Matthew_Larocque: CUVY J1 ......Y +28 399
#note I really had no option but to play this. Even if I know it isn't a word, I still have to try it.
>Marilyn_Wilkins: AEIX 14A AXE +25 394
#note She does hold, but figures I'm stuck with CUV so she can win regardless. That's exactly why she should challenge, I can't do crap with my letters anyway. Even if she loses her turn, all I can do is play VU(G), and then I'm C stuck. Unfortunately, Marilyn doesn't see 11J AX, and choses the  highest scoring AXE without realizing the fatal consequences.
>Matthew_Larocque: CUV A13 V.C +24 423
#note I once lost a game because I let my opponent play VAC on me, completely forgetting about it. Funny that I steal a game for that exact same reason. 
>Marilyn_Wilkins: I 1J .I +11 405
>Marilyn_Wilkins:  (U) +2 407
#note Other than the unforunate way the game was won, this was probably my favourite game of the tournament. I guess it should be the 591, new record, but it's more like the-game-that-should-have-been-600-but-wasn't. There was probably like 100 ways to get over 600 in that game.
