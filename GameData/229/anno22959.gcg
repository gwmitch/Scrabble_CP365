#note missing the P hook ended up being very costly. KELEP or KEP would've been nice. Quackle's favorite, however, is EKE at E10, conserving the P and a decent bingo leave for row 5.

#note Although RENEW sims better, I wonder now if TEW going for 1 of the 3 esses is a better option. Just NEW sims the best of them all, but I don't see how that helps the board.
