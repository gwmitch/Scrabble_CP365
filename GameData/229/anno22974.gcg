>Josh_Greenway: EEEESSU -EEEU +0 0
#note This is my second game against Maneck this tournament (and second ever) - I won the first game handily, and if I can win again, I'll finish day 2 at 7-1.
OK, even I know it's time to exchange! I keep SSE - and quackle agrees with it.

>Maneck_Contractor: IPZ 8G ZIP +28 28
>Josh_Greenway: AEEHRSS J4 HEARSES +79 79
#note I draw really well and play the bingo. I actually gave up 6 points hooking the 1st S to (ZIP)S instead of the second. Not sure if I missed it, or if this was some kind of strategic decision. Oh well, if it was a mistake, it's still a good start! (I didn't notice that RESHA(P)ES also played)
>Maneck_Contractor: OY K10 OY +12 40
>Josh_Greenway: ADGGLLL K2 GLAD +23 102
#note GALL is better than GLAD, but it's pretty close. 
>Maneck_Contractor: CI 2I CI. +8 48
>Josh_Greenway: AFGHLLW L9 FLAW +28 130
#note Second best move here again - but the first best would have been much better (WHA for 43, hooking (HA)W and (ED)H)
>Maneck_Contractor: ADEL G6 LA.ED +17 65
>Josh_Greenway: EFGHLRT 5E LEG +25 155
#note I miss a nice 34 play with HEFT - but 25 for LEG isn't terrible, plus I feel like the H & F will be good scoring tiles. 
>Maneck_Contractor: ?BEIMST 13F TIMBErS +75 140
#note Maneck gets most of my 90 point lead back here - but the good news is I'm still up by 15.
>Josh_Greenway: CDFHORT L4 THO +31 186
#note Only one vowel so I try to make the most of it - I finally find that spot from earlier. I take a 46 point lead and hope to draw some vowels.
>Maneck_Contractor: JKOU 12D JOUK +38 178
#note Maneck gets almost all of it back here and we're virtually tied. Let's see if I got any vowels...
>Josh_Greenway: CDFRRRT -CDFRRRT +0 186
#note ...nope! Quackle likes a couple of plays, but I feel I have to exchange. The top exchanges in the queue have me keeping CR, CRT and RT. I keep none of those, and go looking for the other blank by exchanging 7.
>Maneck_Contractor: MU H13 .UM +21 199
>Josh_Greenway: AIINQRX 10D QAI. +16 202
#note the suggested play is (J)INX, but that seems pretty risky. There was no big X play, so I got rid of the Q and played conservatively. I would love to draw AE (there's a nice AX(L)E play sitting right there!)
>Maneck_Contractor: EOTV 13A VETO +23 222
>Josh_Greenway: CIINRXY 14B XI +38 240
#note There's only one play to make, and quackle agrees. I retake a small lead.
>Maneck_Contractor: ?INNORS 15H .ORNINgS +80 302
#note uh-oh. Maneck takes a 62 point lead and I'm nervous as hell
>Josh_Greenway: ACEINRY M6 ICY +13 253
#note There are so many nice plays here but I don't make any of them. Plus, I set up a small scoring play with the Y to the triple. I think this is th worst play so far this game
>Maneck_Contractor: AA 14M AA +8 310
>Josh_Greenway: ABENRTU 4A BUNTER +26 279
#note I like this play, it scores well, and opens some lines. Plus, a B in that spot in the triple line may be hard to capitalize on. Quackle likes some other plays more, but I'm not feeling like I've lost this game, even down 32 with a third of the bag left.
>Maneck_Contractor: AEORT A4 .OATER +24 334
>Josh_Greenway: ADDEERV E10 .V. +12 291
#note Not a lot of great choices here. I play (A)V(O) to move the V. Actually I don't know what I was thinking here. That I'm going to bingo through the N? Seems unlikely. This seems straight up like a poor play.
>Maneck_Contractor: EFGNNTU C3 G.U +8 342
#note Maneck blocks what is likely the last real lane
>Josh_Greenway: ADDEEER 8M .EA +18 309
#note There are some nice scoring plays that I miss (mostly parallel to the ATER in BOATER. This move doesn't appear on quackle's list.
>Maneck_Contractor: EFNNORT 9N FE +12 354
#note another block, and a 46 point lead with 9 tiles left in the bag after this play
>Josh_Greenway: DDEEIOR B6 DIRE +22 331
#note Wow, quackle really likes DDEEIR as a leave. Why? Where am I going to play it? This DIRE play doesn't appear on quackle's top 20. I'm so confused. It scores more than any play in the top 20. I really don't understand.
>Maneck_Contractor: INNNPRT 7F N.P +9 363
#note I have Maneck tracked, and it looks like I can go out ahead of her. I'm glad this play was only for 9.
>Josh_Greenway: DEOOW M2 WOE +19 350
#note I miss the top play here (OWE making (SOL)O, (YA)W and (W)E), and leave 5 on the table. 
>Maneck_Contractor: INNRT B12 N..T +11 374
>Josh_Greenway: DO N2 OD +19 369
#note I need 19 points for the tie, and 20 points for the win (picking up 6 points off Maneck's rack). I see 19 with OD / (W)O / (O)D, and I would then do a recount. I spend a few minutes looking for another play but can't find one. I grab the tie and we recount - I missed 1 point on BUNTER which means... I win by 1 point! I love recount wins, but they're way more satisfying if you find a point on the other side of the scoresheet - but I'll take it! 7-1 today, 12-4 for the tournament, and I have a piece of first place (I'm in 3rd based on spread but Tim, Lindsey and I are all 12-4). I have a chance at this thing! I should really get a good night's sleep, and be rested and prepared in the morning, but let's face it, I'm in New Orleans and that's just not going to happen.
