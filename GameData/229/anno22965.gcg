#note exchange 5
>Josh_Greenway: ?EFLQTV 8G FELT +14 14
#note All quackle wants here is an exchange. but apparently, I don't exchange nearly enough (one measly exchange in 8 games so far this tournament). so instead, I play FELT and leave myself QV? ... Judi and I have played once before, back in 2014 at BAT (I won that one)
>Judi_Boviard: DIKS K8 SKID +26 26
>Josh_Greenway: ?AJMQSV J10 Qi +63 77
#note I'm ok burning a blank for 63 points! 
>Judi_Boviard: AILR 7E LAIR +13 39
>Josh_Greenway: AFJMOSV 6C FOAM +27 104
#note So I choose FOAM here, but I can see why JAV(A) and JAM would be better - I'm throwing both vowels on the board which gives me a worse leave
>Judi_Boviard: ADEGT 5E GATED +27 66
>Josh_Greenway: IIIJSSV H2 JIV. +18 122
#note wow, with all these I's I figured quackle would suggest exchanging. Instead quackle suggests I do what I did. That's a shocker! This feels like quackle is actually considering defence for a change
>Judi_Boviard: GOO C3 GOO. +16 82
>Josh_Greenway: CIINPSS D2 NIP +21 143
#note I miss SPICS (hooking under GAL) for 41, and instead roll with NIP - I guess I'm betting with 3 of 4 S's and 1 blank known, that I'm going to be able to front hook S(NIP) to grab that triple. Seems risky considering Judi played an S for just 26 earlier. Let's see how this works out...
>Judi_Boviard: AEERRTU -  +0 82
#note exchange 3
>Josh_Greenway: ?CILRSS -  +0 143
#note I miss CRISSaL here for 89 (I don't know it), but worse I miss SLICeRS for 77 somehow! That's terrible. My choice ends up being to exchange 3: CLI. How is it that only my second exchange in the whole tournament is one that robs me of a bingo. Sweet, sweet irony
Exchange 3
>Judi_Boviard: AEP 2H .APE +19 101
>Josh_Greenway: ?EHIRSS 1A HISSERs +87 230
#note Wow, I totally missed that this play scores more hooking Qi and SKID! Oh well, I get the bingo, take a 100+ point lead and actually take advantage of that S(NIP) hook I set up. Bet you didn't see that coming! Surprise ending!
>Judi_Boviard: ADERT 1K DATER +24 125
>Josh_Greenway: ACEIUVY M1 .IVY +20 250
#note quackle doesn't love it (it loves CAVIE hooking to (GAL)E which is way better) but my only question is: what's a CAVIE? Oh, it's a hencoop? I thought a hencoop was a hencoop, not a cavie. Oh wait, hencoop is good? yes it is. Here I thought it was two words. Oh Scrabble, you make very little sense.
>Judi_Boviard: HO 6I OH +16 141
>Josh_Greenway: AACEENU L4 ACE +20 270
#note Two things about this move: 1) I like this play more than the top valuations which open the triple lane and 2) I must be feeling cocky because I'm opening another line (or a better line) and hoping to score more. Up 104, feels like I should be closing.
>Judi_Boviard: MR K1 ..RM +15 156
>Josh_Greenway: AEINNUY A1 .UNNY +12 282
#note This is not a good rack (obvs!) so I play a phony for 12 points and close down a line. Judi didn't like the word she tells me later - but at 12 points, I think it's a hard one to challenge because it seems plausible. Plausible enough to fool myself into playing it. Judi accepts.
>Judi_Boviard: NW 3G W.N +14 170
>Josh_Greenway: ADEGILO 8A GLIDE +32 314
#note Hey, someone finally gets this triple - and it's me. Quackle likes DOGIE and LOGIA better than GLIDE because I would hold back a consonant. Makes sense. As an aside I had to google "vowels and con..." to get the correct spelling of consonant - when I typed in to google what I thought it was spelled like, Google was like WTF? 
>Judi_Boviard: AINORTU D8 .URATION +70 240
>Josh_Greenway: ABLOOUW 15A BOO. +18 332
#note Judi bingos but I'm still up by 69, so feeling pretty safe. Ive definitely blown games like this before, so I know I have to keep scoring. This is the best I can come up with. In a situation like this, I kind of like to split up any high point consonants (got it on the first try! I am learning) into separate plays to get more out of them. I don't know if that's right or not.
>Judi_Boviard: ACEEOUZ 10B ZE.O +33 273
>Josh_Greenway: AAELNUW 11D .WA +22 354
#note seems ok, it's quackle's second best play. 
>Judi_Boviard: B 13C B. +8 281
>Josh_Greenway: AELNTUX B10 .AX +19 373
#note Type a note here!ok I get it quckle, you're obsessed with leave. I just want to win and get to the next game. My play suits me fine, but I can't believe quackle doesn't like it's beautiful LA(T)EX play more (hooking A(B), (OW)E and (A)X) - it's worth 31 and is a gorgeous play
>Judi_Boviard: CEEEIRT A11 TEE +16 297
>Josh_Greenway: ELNRTUU M6 LURE +8 381
#note no comment - not on the list - I'm just looking to go out next turn
>Judi_Boviard: CEIS 12H CIS +19 316
>Josh_Greenway: NTU H12 .UNT +18 399
#note Only one choice here - I play it and Judi doesn't seem impressed, saying 'nice word' in a disapproving tone. Sorry Judi! You seem really nice and maybe I should have sacrificed points to not play a rude word... but I didn't make that choice. Looks like we overcounted Judi's play of OH (it was for 16 instead of 19) - so final score: 400-320
>Josh_Greenway:  (E) +2 401
