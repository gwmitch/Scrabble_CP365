#note "How to Topple the Giant", part 1, Cornwall, ON.

A simple estimative calculation would have brought me to the conclusion that TIBIAE was better than my exchange. 

Actually, I always overvalue E+[bingo consonant]. So I would have done pass = 0 + ET = 4 (it's actually closer to 2). So my exchange would have been worth 4 points.

Then TIBIAE = 18 - 5 for the U leave =13 - the floating ABEIT that would exist if I exchanged, so let's say -1 point each. 13-5 = 8, -2 for giving back a 2x2 and it's still better than 4 points. But I was exhausted and angry at how I was playing, so I decided to keep playing badly.

#note If I had played H7 TIBIAE, he would have no bingo. Nothing.
>Josh: ABEGITV 7A VIBE +23 23
#note Middling play. I need to play F8 (O)BVIATE or D8 (M)EGABIT

>Josh: AADGHOT 6B HOG +39 62
#note Ah, if he would have hung that G somewhere useful, can you see what I would have had? 

Anyways, it's worth thinking about 9C GOAD here for 11 fewer, but it's important, I think, to leave the B9 spot and the VUG hooks open for later. Otherwise GOAD is pretty good positionally for the rest of the board. HOG seems to close the top left, but nothing is going on there anyway. The board is fine in this state. My leave is not.

#note Best play! I assumed that there were two ways forward here. A) Play an 11, and hope it gets challenged unsuccessfully (this seemed to have a nonzero chance of occurring, even though I was over 100% sure UNEMPOWERED* was complete bogus). B) play an 11, hope it gets challenged successfully, and hope opponent opens up a juicy spot for the Q he has no idea you are keeping. C) is what occurred. He didn't even hold! Wut
>Deen_Hergott: AELX 11H AXLE +27 207
#note No Q spot either.
>Josh: AAGQRTT G2 TARGA +18 128
#note This, on the other hand, was held for a while.
>Deen_Hergott: EEFILST 14B FELSITE +85 292
>Josh: ACEILQT 15A QAT +43 171
#note I thought maybe H1 QI could have been further considered. It seems to leave the board more open for a comeback than QAT, actually, but allows Deen to just keep scoring more than QAT. I think I should have played QI, just so that I could possibly draw into a bingo beginning in Q later. I need at least 3 bingos to stay in this game.
>Deen_Hergott: ??INOSU 15F sINUOuS +77 369
#note B2 OUtS(HIN)INg is fantastic (I was even looking there with far less conducive tiles this game), but this is definitely better positionally. Nice find by Deen.
>Josh: CEILRRT 12K RELIC +22 193
#note gotta do whatcha gotta do. There are nicer plays, but this is the only one that might allow me to win now.
>Deen_Hergott: ERTW N10 WR.TE +32 401
>Josh: AALORST O12 .OLA +22 215
#note ALASTOR! Doesn't fit or play on this board unfortunately.
>Deen_Hergott: JO 13C JO. +51 452
#note Oh.
>Josh: AEIRSTU L14 U. +2 217
#note I had 15 minutes on my clock versus Deen's 6 before this play. After this play I had fewer than 10. I couldn't believe nothing played! Jeez :(. This is the best play at least! Whoohoo!
>Deen_Hergott: AEENRSU K1 UNERASE. +68 520
#note I play one tile off, and Deen gets away with opening a 3x3 instead of seeing 2D SAU(T)ERNE... This is definitely better for spread! And anyways, the tile I just fished off is definitely the safest one to put in a 3x3 lane.
>Josh: ADEIRST O4 ASTRIDE +82 299
#note Shh. Don't tell anyone I missed DISRATE!!!!! Well, if you do, tell them it was because I was losing by 303 after getting away with a phony 11, not making huge mistakes, but mostly because I was considering playing REA(U)DITS* hoping I would get away with it against a player who is notorious for letting my phoneys slide.

#note -8 to 1K (U)NBID or 1H OBT(U)ND
>Josh: ACIINPV I2 PAVIN +22 321
#note 1K (U)NCAP allows me to score 329 instead of 321, but ends up the same spread-wise.
