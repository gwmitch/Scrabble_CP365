>Winter: AALNQRX 8G LAX +20 20
>Jeremy_Hall: CILOT 9F LOTIC +24 24
#note Tightens up immediately.
>Winter: AIJNPQR H7 Q.. +12 32
#note Why give him a comeback?
>Jeremy_Hall: S H7 ...S +13 37
#note Telegraphing that other ess.
>Winter: ACIJNPR 10E CAP. +19 51
#note C or V are gold in this position.
>Jeremy_Hall: BO E10 .OB +14 51
#note Okay, now it's open--nothing I can do.
>Winter: IIJNNRR 12C JI. +24 75
#note Didn't see (LA)RI, which would have cut his bingo chances.
>Jeremy_Hall: EM F9 ..ME +23 74
#note My miss let him have the spot.
>Winter: ?GINNRR D11 R.N +8 83
#note Can't remember if LAME takes an ess, but at least I have the R to hook. I assume he'll take the J.
>Jeremy_Hall: NU C12 .UN +24 98
>Winter: ?EGINRW 13F REdWING +72 155
#note I know he has the ess, but what am I gonna do?
>Jeremy_Hall: EINSZ M9 ZEINS +70 168
#note Ouch! I knew he would zing me, but this is too much. I was hoping to have the momentum, but he gets it back.
>Winter: DEIIOTV G12 D. +18 173
#note Still defensing it up. 
>Jeremy_Hall: IPR B13 RIP +17 185
>Winter: EIOOTUV A14 TO +21 194
#note Getting uncomfortably tight. I figure Jeremy has an A to hook Z and open it up, but he doesn't want to.
>Jeremy_Hall: AELT 12J LEA.T +20 205
>Winter: EEIOTUV K10 OV.. +14 208
#note I'm surprised that Quackle is actually giving my defensive plays top billing.
>Jeremy_Hall: AD 10K .D.A +7 212
#note Wow, this is going to be bad.
>Winter: EEGIRTU H13 .UG +9 217
#note I really don't want to give him a bingo line, because that would be the game, but I have to score.
>Jeremy_Hall: EIOOR 15H .OOIER +8 220
>Winter: EEEIORT L12 ..E. +5 222
#note Getting frustrated because I'm not drawing any intermediate tiles, and I miss (I)RE, which would have stopped Jeremy from scoring later.
>Jeremy_Hall: F 8F F... +25 245
#note AARRGHH!!!
>Winter: EEIORST 14E ES +18 240
#note This keeps me in the game, but I lost the momentum. Not sure why Quackle favours OS--there's not going to be any bingoing on this board, and I'd rather have a wider range of tiles.
>Jeremy_Hall: KL 11M .LK +10 255
#note If I had played (I)RE two turns later, he canot play that K.
>Winter: EGIORRT D11 ...G +12 252
#note If I had played OS, I'd be screwed on this turn.
>Jeremy_Hall: M J12 ..M. +12 267
#note Dammit--F, K now M--he's pulling the scoring tiles.	
>Winter: DEIORRT E14 .D +3 255
#note Probably should have exchanged, but I did not want to let him score there.
>Jeremy_Hall: AAA -AAA +0 267
>Winter: EIORRST -EIORRT +0 255
#note I see a remote chance to come back, if I can pull the blank and the Y to mY(C)(FLAX)Y. It's unlikely, but I might as well maximise my odds by exchanging as many tiles as possible.
>Jeremy_Hall: A -A +0 267
>Winter: ?BHISVY J7 mY. +25 280
#note Wow, I was so thrilled to get both the blank and Y that I didn't even look for other options!
>Jeremy_Hall: AEN K5 NAE +7 274
>Winter: BHIISTV L7 HI +11 291
#note I worry about a bingo, but as luck would have it, I don't have any of the 4 wowels that I can parallel along the N, so I have to let him have it.
>Jeremy_Hall: AAEFN L1 FAENA +26 300
#note Jeremy goes for it.
>Winter: BISTTVY 2K T.V +6 297
#note I'm extremely worried of giving up anything, so taking a chance on scoring next turn seems to be the play. My only worry is something like THIE(F).
>Jeremy_Hall: AE M4 AE +7 307
>Winter: BDIOSTY 1J DI. +9 306
#note Make sure he can't get THIE(F), confident that I can hurt him next turn. Don't see a good way for him to block.
>Jeremy_Hall: HU N3 UH +11 318
>Winter: BORSTWY O1 BYS +26 332
#note BYS looked like it should do it, as long as there are no otherr places for Jeremy to go after be plays A(B).
>Jeremy_Hall: AEIORTU 1N A. +4 322
#note Ohhhhh, he could have had me!!!
>Winter: EORTW -  +0 332
>Jeremy_Hall: EIORTU -  +0 322
#note No, wait, never mind--he cannot play RETI(NAE) without giving me an out.
>Winter: EORTW -  +0 332
>Jeremy_Hall: EIORTU -  +0 322
>Winter: EORTW -  +0 332
>Jeremy_Hall: EIORTU -  +0 322
