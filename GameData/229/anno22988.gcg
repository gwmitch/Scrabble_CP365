>Matthew_Larocque: AQT H7 QAT +24 24
#note How do you forget to write down the first rack?
>Emil_Rem: AFG G8 FAG +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: ADENORS 8G ..DO +8 32
#note Let's make another S hook? The leave is really strong keeping the D too, but I thought it looked challenging for him to score well after this.
>Emil_Rem: GRW J6 GR.W +12 28
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEKNRS 11G SNEAKeR +78 110
#note Don't ask me why I didn't play SNAKiER instead. Because I'm too lazy?
>Emil_Rem: ADEESTU 12I TEASED +28 56
#note Can't say I really agree with this play. 
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILNRX L4 ReLAXIN.. +94 204
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILNRX --  -94 110
#note Emil just blew up his rack, and as a result made the board kind of messy, so I felt like it was worth trying to get away with this.
>Emil_Rem: CU M9 CU.. +9 65
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILNRX K5 XI +21 131
#note Not going to play L(U)X, but how do I not see RAX for 37? It even sets up an S hook for my blank. XI is hideous by comparison.
>Emil_Rem: BENU L4 BUN +23 88
#note I'm guessing he passed on NUB?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AILNRT 13M RAT +23 154
#note Now I see it. It doesn't seem like it will be easy for him to do anything about it.
>Emil_Rem: Y K11 ..Y +10 98
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ILNOPT 14G LIPTONs +78 232
#note Lipton's chicken noodle soup? After the game, when I find out it's phony, I actually think of PONTILS. I'm sure I've studied this rack before, and I probably guessed LIPTONS 4 or 5 times. It still isn't a word!
>Emil_Rem: CEIOV 13C VOICE +25 123
>Matthew_Larocque: DELNORS 15B RONDELS +86 318
#note I never asked for this
>Emil_Rem: EEP -  +0 123
#note I didn't deserve a free turn for playing RONDELS.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEEIJV O13 .AJ +30 348
#note At least I can afford to be lazy and stupid for the rest of the game now.
>Emil_Rem: EEP M2 PEE +14 137
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIUVW 1J WIVE +20 368
#note Maybe just VIE for maximum defense. Or 1M EAU/EEW? Everything is 100% so I just want to keep it air tight.
>Emil_Rem: EYZ N4 YEZ +43 180
#note I couldn't even remember for sure if this was a word. Someone looked it up and said it wasn't, but then I confirmed for myself that it was. Weird.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEHHLOU O5 HAUL +37 405
>Emil_Rem: FNO 2I FON +17 197
>Matthew_Larocque: DEHINOO J1 ..OD +8 413
#note This is just silly. In my quest to stop seven letter words from playing, I miss N1 DO for 26. I can also just playing something like HOODIE or HOIDEN to end the game faster.
>Emil_Rem: RS 1J ....RS +36 233
#note I scored 8, he scored 36. Lazy and stupid, Matt.
>Matthew_Larocque: EHIMNO 12D HM +28 441
#note Or HO, although he might have -OM or -RM words.
>Emil_Rem: ABOT 11B BOTA +28 261
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINO 14A OE +8 449
#note Missed my rack, but I was trying to hold off on playing a long word, to try and beat him going out.
>Emil_Rem: AGM 10A GAM +18 279
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIINTU 4E UNITE. +8 457
#note I don't see TIEIN(G), and this gives him a way to go out.
>Emil_Rem: EIILR F2 LI.ER +9 288
#note Emil doesn't think to add the other I.
>Matthew_Larocque: II J14 .I +2 459
>Emil_Rem: I H4 .I +2 290
>Emil_Rem:  (I) +2 292
#note An underwhelming effort, I just didn't get punished for most of my mistakes.
