#note I wonder if I remembered the D hook, because I missed FOLIAGED later in the tournament.

#note just ZA is better.
>Sal_Piro: AIL 5K AIL +12 122
>JD: BEESTTW 4H WEEST +32 127
#note tricky move. I thought about WEBS at the same spot. quackle's champion is TEW at 4L, which I think is unrealistic given his fishing. quackle has him bingoing 15% of the time after TEW when the real percentage should probably be at least 30%, and the fishing kinda suggests an S. I was kinda hoping he would challenge too.
>Sal_Piro: EIV H1 VIE. +30 152
>JD: BDEFOTU 3E FEU.D +30 157
#note took me a long time to come up with this. BUTEO in the same spot is also reasonable.
>Sal_Piro: EIJR 1F JI.ER +15 167
>JD: ?BOOPTU 6A UPO. +12 169
#note a little bit crazy, I guess. Quackle says LOB at F8 which makes more sense.
>Sal_Piro: NNO A4 NO.N +5 172
#note he blocked my 3x3!
>JD: ?ABMORT E7 M.BOcRAT +76 245
#note almost the 3x3 with PRONOUNS, but I'm happy I found this.
>Sal_Piro: AHIL 14B LAI.H +32 204
>JD: IMPQSTW 15A QI +35 280
#note wouldn't have figured it, but SIMP wins the sim. the QW combo makes me want to retch, but vowels are at a premium, and the Q can be dumped next turn no matter what.
>Sal_Piro: DEERRRS 10E .RDERERS +63 267
>JD: ?KMPSTW D13 K.P +18 298
#note a tough move, but TWAS looks better than my play due to the vowel shortage/instant points.
>Sal_Piro: CCISTUV -CC +0 267
>JD: ?GMSTWY N2 GYMS +24 322
#note GAYETY appears to be falling prey to quackle's overevaluation of future leaves' potential. That being said, quackle likes WRY significantly more. I considered it, but underestimated the value of scoring on row 15.
>Sal_Piro: INSTTUV -IN +0 267
>JD: ?ANTTVW 15F AWN +23 345
#note WYN at M3 maybe?
>Sal_Piro: DEISTTU M5 .EU +4 271
>JD: ?CRTTUV H8 .V.RT +9 354
#note the only play that isn't an exchange. I didn't expect the pool to bring anything too good giving his fishing.
>Sal_Piro: T G7 T. +3 274
>JD: ?ACCDTU L10 .CUD +14 368
>Sal_Piro: I 12G I. +2 276
>JD: ?ACDHIT N7 THICk +17 385
#note I play another spectacularly bad endgame, missing SCUDI entirely. but I mistracked and wanted to prevent the outbingo.
>Sal_Piro: BEILNST O11 INLET +19 295
>JD: AD O8 AD +27 412
#note this sequence, which is what I had in mind originally, looks good but fails with LEIS at O6. oh well.
