#note I didn't love this play but it tops the static evaluator.  I considered 7H BID 15 which made sense because I had the I hook.
>Paul_A.: KOP 6D KOP. +19 45
>Brad_W.: BDIIRWX H4 XI +21 40
#note one of those situations where it didn't make sense to play through it but I couldn't figure out what to trade either.  Keeping BDIRW is not exactly inspiring.  Considered D3 BIR(K) 20 but didn't like DIWX either.  There are a few plays that set up big comebacks at 8A that I discarded.

#note I forgot to look for plays parallel to the X.  I2 WHIN 28 is good.

#note I wasn't sure of this but it looks like a word and it gives him the triple back.  Couldn't find FReeDOM.  The only 7 I could find was DeiFORM and it didn't play.

>Brad_W.: AEEEFIR I8 .E.E +9 298
#note I thought he was throwing back the Q.  The Q is really not compatible with this board and will be a killer to whoever gets it.  I decided to continue to play short and hope I don't draw it.  I could have played even shorter and done I8 (D)E(N) 8 but it didn't matter... the first tile I drew out of the bag was the Q.  Fuck.
>Paul_A.: A 9I ..A +3 274
#note OK I guess he plans to bingo next turn
>Brad_W.: AEFGIQR 3I .EG +4 302
#note I was running low on time so I had to make some quick decisions.  I wanted to at least attempt to block his bingo lane, but I also needed to set up a Q spot also.  I laid down J2 FA 15, which would set up (F)AQIR 34 next turn, but then I realized it didn't block his lane at all.  If he plays a 7 ending in S next turn, I'm screwed.  3I (N)EG 4 seemed to be perfect, because it set up FAQIR for a zillion points, and would not likely be blocked, especially if he gets his bingo.
>Paul_A.: AEINSTU L9 SINUATE +70 344
#note he got his bingo
>Brad_W.: AEFIIQR 2J FAQIR +66 368
#note that worked like a charm.  He asked me "what did you draw?" and I told him it didn't matter, I already had FAQIR on my previous rack.  He was shocked.  Turns out he had traded CC on that earlier turn.  Also turns out he probably could have won if he blocked my Q spot(s), because if he ends up drawing the Q himself, he has the U to go with it.  But that's counterintuitive from his standpoint.  He's going to play the bingo every time.
