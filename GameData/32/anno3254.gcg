#note AFOOT is a no-brainer but I didn't see it.  How did I win this tournament?  Only saw OAF but didn't like any of the placements.

#note not sure why I played the ED but it seemed to make sense at the time.  Maybe because I didn't have an S and wanted to give myself the E to play through.

#note this was a mistake.  I wrote down all seven 7's, looking for one that put the I next to the TLS in case I could draw the X and get an easy 50-pointer next turn to get back in the game.  When I realized none of them did this, I just slapped one down.  Earlier in my thought process I liked IRATEST because RUN couldn't be hooked on the DWS but then when it came time to make my play, I completely forgot.
