#note Quackle agrees to fish, but wants more points with F8 PI. I dunno, if I'm gonna fish, I'd rather open the line for my bingo. Fuck 8 points. (-5.7)

#note This play is interesting. It could make Chris's possible bingo even more potent. Or it could leave me with a hot spot to snapback with after he bingos elsewhere. Also, it's the only spot for the Q. All that said, (-8.9) for not knowing FACETE.
>Chris_Lipe: ABERSTU I2 ARBUTES +76 212
#note WATERBUS another choice.

#note SEIZE and FACETE is 83. I had a brain fart and talked myself out of AZIDES. (It's AZIDO that doesn't take the S, ar-tard). BAIZE is lousy. (-36.1)
>Chris_Lipe: INNRTTV M3 V.NT +14 281
#note Shitty draw.
>Matthew: AADEESW 5K DA. +25 292
#note I like how the word FACETE is going to cost me like a thousand points throughout this game. (-13.2)

#note lucky
>Chris_Lipe: ?ALNRTU A13 .UN +20 373
#note Wow... Chris had one here. Try to find it. HUN finally blocks FACETE and I can stop losing points down there...

>Chris_Lipe: ?ALMRRT K10 MARR. +20 393
#note He has one here, too. This one's even harder. I have to say I would not be finding these bingos with his racks...
