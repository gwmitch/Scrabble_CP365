#note I wasn't sure of this but I didn't hold.  Wonder if it takes the S?  or is it a past tense of THINK?

>Dan_P.: AGPS M5 GAPS +23 91
#note sure I guess it takes the S
>Brad_W.: DEEILTV 13I D..IE +29 108
#note this was a dangerous play because I didn't know what DIDIE meant.  It had the look of an adjective for some reason (it's not... it's a noun and takes the S).
>Dan_P.: ALNOT L2 TONAL +15 106
#note does that take a front A?
>Brad_W.: ELORTVW N3 VROW +36 144
#note REVOW* would have been huge but I talked myself out of it (thankfully so)
>Dan_P.: AABIL 1K LABIA +31 137
#note I guess it does take the front A.  I held.  It looked like a normal word from real life, but I remember there being a similar word that I thought would take the front A but doesn't.  I didn't realize until just a few minutes ago that the word I was trying to think of was VOCAL (AVOCAL* is not a word).

>Brad_W.: FLNOOTY D11 TOF.Y +36 229
#note at first I was disappointed I didn't have a hook letter to use the TWS in the corner.  Then I saw I had 15G OF 32 but the LNOTY leave didn't inspire me.  Then I saw an even better play.

#note I had a stroke of brilliance here.  OK maybe not but it was the type of strategic move I don't make very often.  I was going to play something safe like O12 JAN(E) 19.  There were 7 tiles in the bag and it was probably a good idea to get rid of the J soon.  Then I started thinking, he's fishing, but is he fishing because the board sucks and he has no tiles, or is he fishing because he might be close to a bingo?  Bingoing to the N (or maybe the T) wouldn't be unheard of.  So I looked for a play in that spot.  The play I decided on set me up for a huge J play that could be blocked by him, but not for a lot of points (which is good because I was scoring virtually nothing myself).  Also, if he somehow comes up with a 5-letter play for that spot, he would empty the bag giving me a chance to plan an endgame.
>Dan_P.: AADIN J2 NAIAD +21 343
#note sure enough, he emptied the bag
>Brad_W.: AIJMNRS 11I J...NS +16 340
#note I had a lot of time so I considered this play very carefully.  I wanted to play D6 RAMI 20 but that gave me only one out, J(A)MS through the A I just played, which would be blocked.  RANI in the same spot is not any better.  I decided to play JNS first, leaving RAMI as the out play.  It would be blocked, in which case I would play 5F MARI(A) 7 to go out.  I looked at his potential plays.  I saw D7 REI 15 which appeared to lose by 1.  At first I thought 9A RO(Q)UE 14 tied, but then I realized I had RAMI(E) to the E he would play to go out.  I didn't see any winning plays for him so I made my play.  Turns out I missed a few high-scoring J plays like 5E JARIN(A) 26 and H4 JANI(TO)R 22/JANI(TO)RS 23.
>Dan_P.: CEEIORU D7 REI +15 358
#note during his turn, I was frantically recounting the game to make sure there were no scoring errors that would affect the outcome.  I was pretty low on time by this point.
>Brad_W.: AIMR 5F MARI. +7 347
>Brad_W.:  (CEOU) +12 359
#note he recounted but I felt confident everything was correct
