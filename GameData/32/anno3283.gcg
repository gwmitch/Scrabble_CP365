>Ray: EFORZ 8D FROZE +42 42
#note Nice enough start!
>moh: AEEPRTV 8A PRE..... +66 66
>Ray: IMNU I6 MUNI +31 73
#note Nice hook! I was hoping that if opp was unsure of PREFROZE, he'd avoid hooking it. No guts, no glory!
>moh: AEOTUUV E5 OUT.AVE +40 106
#note Easy choice once again. Nothing else is even close.
>Ray: BY J5 BY +30 103
>moh: AENTTUU J9 TUTU +8 114
#note Ugh! I was planning on NUTATE from H1 until you blocked it with BY. So why didn't I play 4G NUTATE? I have no good explanation. 5J (B)UTUT is also decent, and there are several other plays that are much better than my TUTU. 
>Ray: ??ADGII 12B rAIDInG +80 183
#note I guess you can't expect to find PYGIDIAL every time! Short of that, there were lots options along row 12 (e.g., GONIDIA, ABIDING, GIARDIA).
>moh: AEEFGNS K4 FE +18 132
#note 7C FE(T) 24 is probably the play. But I liked the openness that FE brought to the board, as my AEGNS left me expecting a bingo soon (Oh, would I be disappointed!). FE left nice parallel plays along the L column, as well as plays down B and C columns that FET kills.
>Ray: ILMY 4K .ILMY +34 217
#note Very solid play. Many newer players are so phobic about opening triples that they'd pass on a nice play like this. The chances of my playing a bingo through the Y are minimal, and--short of that--opp much better off scoring really well and ridding himself of the Y.
>moh: AEGKNOS O1 OKA. +33 165
#note Obvious, just like I like it. 
>Ray: BGOSTT A12 BOGS +43 260
#note We both knew it was coming. This is where I felt like the game was really slipping, and I was absolutely right--BOGS wins about 87% of the time (although BOTT wins about 90%). 
>moh: EGIJNSV L1 JIV.NG +30 195
#note After the dreaded TUTU, here is my next big blunder. How I missed D1 JIVES for 48 points is beyond me.
>Ray: DEIRTT 14A .RITTED +22 282
>moh: AEHLNST 15F HENT +29 224
#note Alas, no place for HANTLES. Given my deficit, I should have looked harder for a play that left row 15 open. That play was F6 HA(O) for 29.
>Ray: CD C12 .C.D +14 296
>moh: AELOSWX 9B EX +36 260
#note Always beware of the "obvious" play. I didn't think I could pass up the points here, even though it killed my best comeback spots along columns B and C. There are two interesting options here: 7C WO(T) 24 and N4 (M)OXA 29. MOXA obviously scores well and opens up places for my comeback bingo, and it is certainly better than my EX play. However, I really like WOT. That W is a bingo-killer, but the real power of WOT is that it keeps great tiles for scoring a huge non-bingo along row 14 (for instance, AXSEED, EXILES, AXONES, EXPELS, etc.).
>Ray: EENOQSS 6D S.Q +32 328
>moh: ADLLOSW D2 WOLD. +21 281
#note I just wasn't playing well during the second half of the game--how do I see WOLDS and not WOALDS in the same place? D1 ALLOWS is probably the bet pay, followed by D1 WOALD(S), but they are very close.
>Ray: NOW C1 NOW +27 355
>moh: AAELOOS 10D A.O +8 289
#note Depressing, really. I had the right idea, but the proper way to play off those tiles was AZO, not AVO.
>Ray: AN 9E .NA +19 374
>moh: AAEILOS 7A OIL +22 311
#note This is not a bad play per se, but given how far behind I am and how quickly the bag is dwindling, keeping the duplicated As is not a good idea. What (M)OA sacrifices in score it earns back in position--after MOA I have two good bingo spots, and even if opp takes the column O 3W, it likely leaves a column N bingo spot.
>Ray: AAEEIIR N3 A.A +7 381
#note Shut 'er down!
>moh: AACEIPS 1A PA. +15 326
#note I was admittedly desperate, but this uninspired play didn't help the cause at all. C(OW)PIE and C(OW)PEA are both interesting options, and opp might have been tempted to take out the column 1 triple, in which case my column 14 bingo spot stays intact. 11J  (T)APA is also a reasonable try to keep a bingo alive, although there is a good chance opp plays down column M and kills everthing.
>Ray: EEEHINR 14I ER +6 387
>moh: ACEIINS 11J .I +4 330
#note At this point I need opp to do something really stupid, but when desperate, why not hope for such a blunder with TI?
>Ray: EEEHLRS L10 HERE +17 404
>moh: ACEILNS G1 CLINES +22 352
#note M7 INCASE is the best play since my CLINES leaves opp RE(C)S and out.
>Ray: ERS 10L .ERS +9 413
#note Well done, Ray! Looking forward to future games.
>Ray:  (A) +2 415
