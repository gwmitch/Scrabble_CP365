#note took me a while to get to this move, but I think it fits what I try to do with openings. quackle loves it.

#note this guy's good.
>JD: BGHIRSU D4 BIG +29 97
#note grrr, I wanted that O so bad for BROGUISH!! BUHR is the scoring play, but it opens needlessly on a tight board. BRIG is pretty reasonable as well.
>Trip_"T-Pain"_Payne: AIN D10 ANI +9 68
>JD: FHIORSU C3 FOH +30 127
#note I didn't come up with FOU at C5, which is pretty much even.
>Trip_"T-Pain"_Payne: AGIO C9 AGIO +15 83
>JD: INORRSU B1 NOIRS +29 156
#note a lot of competitive options. OUR at 7H or at 9H or YOURN are both reasonable. given his last play it seemed like ok timing for something like NOIRS as opposed to YOURN or a fishier play.

>JD: DDILMOS I9 M.DI +22 205
#note I couldn't remember if SLOID was good or not, which looks like the top choice. I wanted to play something that would keep the board more closed, but the best I could come up with was MOD at 9J which didn't seem worth it.

>JD: CEJORSS N6 JO.ES +30 332
#note sigh. I couldn't remember if JOSHERS was good or not, and that seemed like the worst way ever to lose the game. my word knowledge is clearly spotty. This is a really bad miss that drops my win percentage from 95ish to 85ish. even JOSS at A13 is better, says quackle, although I played JOLES in order to neutralize the board. I basically give him one shot at the bottom-right quadrant and that should be it...but if I play JOSHERS the game is basically over on the spot.

#note ouch
>JD: ?CORSUV 3I ..VOUR +24 356
#note well, at least I picked up one of the blanks. FAVOUR is a bit of a gambling play - I get rid of my worst tiles and hope that I get to cash the S next turn. I don't really see anything competitive.
>Trip_"T-Pain"_Payne: ELS 6J S.L +22 337
>JD: ?CINPSW O1 WISP +49 405
#note I blew this preendgame bigtime. I had time, and I looked, but I didn't realize VERDANCY went down. a huge, preventable mistake - WIZ at N13 blocks it. I'm not even sure I realized VERDANCY was good.
>Trip_"T-Pain"_Payne: ADEENRV L2 N.VE. +23 360
#note lucky me.
>JD: ??CN G2 CoNs +12 417
#note better to out-in-two with COZ at N13. I think I was low on time by now.
>JD:  (ADER) +10 427
#note I made four mistakes this game that I can see. Two of them, in the early game, were pretty minor. The third one let him back into the game. The fourth one easily could've cost me the game. Not all mistakes are born equal.
