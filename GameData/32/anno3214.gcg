>Aldo_Cardia: AAERSST 8H AS +4 4
#note After an interesting opening play like this, I asked him his first rack after the game. This move appears best.
>Phil: AEHIKTV 9G KHI +24 24
#note KIVA J8 is best- I don't love it. KHI on top of AS seems the prime choice here.
>Aldo_Cardia: ADEORST 10E ROASTED +77 81
>Phil: AAENOTV 11J NOVA +22 46
#note Better than OVA, which I strongly considered.
>Aldo_Cardia: EEINRSU E4 REINSU.E +82 163
>Phil: AEGNRTZ D11 NERTZ +50 96
#note Quackle hates this. Apparently GAZES/TZARS/ZETAS are all better despite scoring less and keeing 3 consonants.
>Aldo_Cardia: JOY D3 JOY +35 198
>Phil: AAEEGIU 15A GAU.E +45 141
#note Making the best of the AEEIU draw.
>Aldo_Cardia: MNOR 8A NORM. +30 228
>Phil: AACEEIW C11 AWE +24 165
>Aldo_Cardia: HOO 7A OHO +17 245
>Phil: ACEFITU L11 .ATIC +26 191
#note Ooh who can find the 43-pointer?
>Aldo_Cardia: ERW 15L .REW +27 272
>Phil: EFLOSTU N6 FOULEST +78 269
>Aldo_Cardia: ADP O8 PAD +35 307
>Phil: ?BDGINT M5 DIB +21 290
#note The reason I chose DIB over GIB was the NG? combo. Yes, I know the board is not exactly bingo-prone but it's still a potent combo.
>Aldo_Cardia: BCIIU 13H CUBI.I +22 329
>Phil: ??DGLNT E4 ........D +17 307
#note Ugh... I took the blank slip and circled an I and an E, started to lay down GLiNTeD L1 and realized once I hit the T that it didn't fit. Huge mental mistake, which let him know I had both blanks. THONG B6 is best.
>Aldo_Cardia: IPY J6 YIP +21 350
>Phil: ??GLNQT -GQ +0 307
#note I can't believe I didn't play QaT F2... utterly embarassing.
>Aldo_Cardia: ETV K5 VET +19 369
>Phil: ??LMNNT C6 N..M +9 316
#note ANENT 11C and LORN C6 are best.
>Aldo_Cardia: EL H13 .EL +15 384
>Phil: ??FLNQT L4 Qi +26 342
#note Apparently I don't know the word QAT.
>Aldo_Cardia: AX B7 ..AX +34 418
>Phil: ?FILNRT A1 FLaTIR.. +33 375
#note I wasn't going to bother fishing; no way he lets me get a bingo down if I open.
>Aldo_Cardia: EGGILO A10 EGG +16 434
