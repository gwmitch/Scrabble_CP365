>Steve: DEIJORW 8D JERID +42 42
#note JOWED is best, of course. Saw it, but wasn't 100 percent sure it was good for some reason.
>Jeff: DEELNUZ 7G LEZ +29 29
>Steve: AEIIOWY E4 YOWI. +22 64
>Jeff: BDENOSU D2 DUB +26 55
#note Second best to the missed bingo!
>Steve: AEGILNO F8 .EGIONAL +65 129
>Jeff: AENOOSX C2 OX +39 94
#note Best.
>Steve: EEIMRTU 13B MUTI.EER +74 203
>Jeff: AENOPRS 12H PERSONA +83 177
#note Second best to the missed triple-triple! Note, this play was scored 81, making the actual equity loss even greater.
>Steve: CCEIIST O7 CITIES +38 241
#note About eighth best, and way behind the missed bingo. Had I known that word and found it, duck says I would have been over 93 percent to win the game!
>Jeff: ?ENORSW K5 SWOoNER. +90 267
#note About the same as the other two double-doubles, WORnNESS and iRONWEEDS.
>Steve: BDFGNRU 1A FUB +36 277
#note Not sure of the seventh tile here, the R may have been another D. This is best in either case.
>Jeff: AEKMNOT N10 KO. +35 302
#note Best.
>Steve: CDEGHNR H12 ..CH +33 310
#note If this is the correct rack I missed a big play coming down from H1.
>Jeff: AELMNOT 15H .OTELMAN +92 394
#note Jeff thanked me for setting up his bingo.
>Steve: ADGNNRT 13L DAN +23 333
>Jeff: AAHLOQT 14A QAT +34 428
#note Best.
>Steve: AAGINRT 15A IT +44 377
#note Best. I'm back on track with the right rack, since I remember this non-go.
>Jeff: AEFHLOT 2B H.. +24 452
#note Q prefers J10 FOR and doesn't mention this play in its list of choices. Jeff likes taking out the A column, understandably.
>Steve: AAAGNRV D8 .AVA +14 391
>Jeff: AEFILOT H1 FOLIAT.. +39 491
#note Best.
>Steve: ?AGGINR 1H .oRAGING +92 483
#note FRAgGING another option that's worth the same.
>Jeff: DEEPRSV 11C V.P.D +22 513
#note Jeff loses some point spread by not blocking my out play. PRESE F2 is best, followed by VEEP in the same spot.
>Steve: EUY 3F YU.E +9 492
#note Locking up what should be high loss for the year at the Flint club.
>Steve:  (EERS) +8 500
