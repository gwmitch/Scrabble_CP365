#note best
>Annette: IQU B6 QU.I +33 64
>Jeffrey_: ?ADEGIT A8 .ADGIEsT +88 140
#note Best, reasonable enough chance since CADGY, turns out it's * though. AGIsTED J5 only real bingo
>Annette: ?ILMRSU 15A .URMoILS +86 150
#note You might think my opp. accepted my last so she could play this, but judging from her calling out my blank before I did, I think she was shirr it was gude.
>Jeffrey_: DEIORST 11A .RODIEST +70 210
#note Duck likes J8 STEROID, though I wanted to save that hook for later- this got a hold and eventual acceptance -3.  Neither STODGIER nor DIGESTOR fit, of course.
>Annette: EOZ C11 .OZE. +28 178
#note I held for a minute- it didn't sound right but I let it slide...
>Jeffrey_: AHNNNUY 10E AY +31 241
#note D8 (G)AU(D)Y best, -2, definitely didn't see it, not sure I would have played it if I had- HNNN leave?  Ugh.
>Annette: IN E5 IN.. +8 186
>Jeffrey_: DGHNNNU H11 .HUD. +13 254
#note UGH 14H best play?  -4.5?  I'm supposed to leave 2/3 7 lanes intact?  sari, charley, I would do this agin.  I like the defensive posture and get the sense somehow she's not going to be all (YEP)S on me
>Annette: AR D13 AR. +18 204
>Jeffrey_: GJNNNVX 13G J.N +19 273
#note ugh, and so my consonant cache hurts me.  Quackle likes dump 6, keep X, -2
>Annette: AA D4 AA +6 210
>Jeffrey_: GNNOVX F14 X. +25 298
#note best, although one letter missing, probably the M
>Annette: AW 14H .AW +17 227
>Jeffrey_: GMNNOOV K11 MOON +20 318
#note -14.6 for not knowing GNOMON, which sounds like a great answer in Jamaica.  I haven't seen it but NOV(A) 4A was only 9 off.  Both Ys were out, so I knew she wasn't going to score much to the TWS...
>Annette: AENST L10 TAENS +29 256
>Annette: AENST --  -29 227
#note I was looking at that thinking a) WTF, TAE only takes an L, right?  and b) even if it did take the N, it would be Scottish for TAKEN or something.  Sure enough no -AEN 4 takes the mouse.  I don't know what else she has on her rack but Exch. [those two others] has to be high up there
>Jeffrey_: EFGLLNV 12J G.LF +16 334
#note best- not much to think about here
>Annette: AESTT 15K STATE +25 252
>Jeffrey_: EEELNOV 13M EVE +22 356
#note Best.  I was a bit nervous sticking an E out there, but I have learned 'When you have the choice to take a 7 lane and make them find an 8, do so.'
>Annette: CKOR C1 CORK +26 278
>Jeffrey_: BEEFLNO B2 BE +18 374
#note Quack says -19 for not finding FEEBL(E) O8.  I was too worried about the TWS-TWS I guess, and didn't want to open another slutty 7 lane
>Annette: E N13 .E. +12 290
>Jeffrey_: EFILNOU J10 FU. +19 393
#note duck wants me to open again with OLEFIN(E) -28.  Sari, Quackles, I restricting the only current 7 lane and not making another, especially so close to a bingo.  I know it's amateur to fish at this point, but oh well...
>Annette: AL I6 LA. +6 296
>Jeffrey_: BEILNOR O8 ENROB. +33 426
#note -10 for not playing J5 LOB?  I'd rather have 5 tiles on my rack if she gets a bingo rather than 7.  Also, to be honest, this may have been the first O-column play to the TWS I saw so far.
>Annette: EINSTVW 5I SWIVE +28 324
#note her best out-in-two is J5 WINS then VET, but I don't think she likes (YEP)S

>Jeffrey_: IIILN 6B .I +11 437
#note ah yes, N5 LIN better, -8 for Not Processing Opponent's Play with Not Much Time Left.
>Annette: NT M4 T.N +3 327
