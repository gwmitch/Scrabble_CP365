#note it took me forever to find this.  Didn't see OrTOLAN or OcTANOL.  Also missed the better placement 6E cOOLANT 76 which is a little tricky but I should have seen it.
>Jason_U.: AARV L1 VARA +33 91
>Brad_W.: EELNSSX 10H SEX +32 174
#note I didn't really like this play but couldn't figure out what else to do.  Static evaluator likes it best.

>Brad_W.: EILNSUU 11J ULU +15 189
#note this felt like a division 3 move but static evaluator likes it best

>Brad_W.: EIIJNRS 14A JINS +34 223
#note N1 NISEI 37 would have been cool, although opening the triple would have been a little scary.  I was opening a triple with my play too, but it didn't seem so scary because there were no F's left for OF and I didn't think there were many words that he could hit through the J.

>Brad_W.: EIINRRS 12A .IN.ER +25 270
#note I liked this play because it scored well with EINR and I had the last S

>Brad_W.: BERRSUW 3C B.R +10 330
#note this is where I felt things slipping away.  I was running low on time and couldn't figure out what to do.  I decided to block up the upper-left and balance my rack (sort of... I was keeping the dreaded UW combo).  Turns out the only scoring plays were using the S and I wasn't ready to do that yet.
>Jason_U.: COT 13K COT +19 351
>Brad_W.: EENRSUW O1 ES +30 360
#note same thought process as last turn, but I was getting really low on time and panicky so I took the points.
>Jason_U.: ADM 11C A.M.D +26 377
#note this was a good scoring play for Jason but it also left him with a bunch of vowels.
>Brad_W.: EGNRTUW 5H GUN. +9 369
#note I went for the first out-in-2 I could find, even though the next play could be blocked
>Jason_U.: AAEEOT 3C ...A +6 383
#note blocking my F1 WERT to go out
>Brad_W.: ERTW 5B WE.T +21 390
#note I had to take the points, even though I envisioned him hooking his T on the front.
>Jason_U.: AEEOT 2D .AT +20 403
#note he scored this play as 18.  A5 TOEA 20 wins (but see my notes at the end).
>Brad_W.: R C3 .R.. +9 399
#note During his previous play, I frantically searched for a scoring spot for my R.  For a long time the best I could find was 2 points.  I was ecstatic to find the 9-point play.
>Brad_W.:  (EEO) +6 405
#note After the game, I confirmed the score with him and he thought he had 10 points less than he actually did.  So he played the endgame thinking he had 10 fewer points.  Theoretically this shouldn't matter because he should be trying to play optimally no matter the score, but he did have winning plays toward the end.  For example, on the (BUR)A turn, 5B TO(E)A 15 outruns my outplay by 2 points.  Also, I was a little surprised he didn't ask for a recount.
