#note nice opening rack.  Scored as 100.  I chose this instead of (I)NQUIR(E) because I wanted to give him an opportunity to try to hook an R on the end.

#note I spent a long time on this play.  I didn't like keeping a 2-vowel leave but I couldn't find anything else I liked.  In the end, I took some points and tried to take out the juicy S hook (for the most part).  (R)OBED 27, (R)OBLE 24, and O(R)EIDE 24 have better leaves.

#note after this play, Steve confirmed the score and had himself with 100 more points than he actually had.  I think he thought it was a close game.  He did a good job of keeping up considering how nice my tiles were all game long.
