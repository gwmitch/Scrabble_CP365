#note i saw this in my rack through O right away and I couldn't not play it. I don't know why.  EINSTEIN is good, why can't Avogadro be acceptable?

#note what the heck do you make of this play??  especially when i drew the other blank.  i was so confused.  he has 2 of the 4 tiles that play here, the other two being ?O, and there are 27 unseen.

#note HORSY in this same spot is the star play.  too bad i missed it.

#note i agonized about this, but not in a good, logical way. i knew (R)EHEEL and HE B13 were the two plays to look at, but i didn't know what to do about it or why.  after 1000 plies, he's only supposed to bingo 8% of the time after REHEEL.

#note i had no idea here.  i guess i figured that if i drew an E, i would have a double double, but i really had no great plan here. Sim loooooves COG G3.  don't know why.
