>Diana_Grosman: EPRU 8G PURE +12 12
#note a really interesting move in that I had no idea what to make of it. Diana played a great game, I think. However, I don't think I would ever make this play. UP would have to be superior, unless she has two Es or two Rs in which case she would play PUREE or PURER. She also took about four minutes to make this play, which means that I placed her on a very good leave, which led me to play more defensively. What do you think her leave was?
>JD: DGIRVVX J7 V.X +13 13
#note GIVER sims 1 better, I think because this sets up VEXT too easily. I didn't want to give her an S hook though. I think this play is fine.
>Diana_Grosman: KO G6 KO. +10 22
>JD: DGIRRVY K8 RIDGY +36 49
#note VEX also allowed me to score points this turn with a reasonable draw, which is what happened.
>Diana_Grosman: ?BEHNSU -?BE +0 22
>JD: ACEHLRV L12 ARCH +36 85
#note static proposes fishing off the H. sims even, but I would rather not fish against an opponent that I'm rated a lot higher than, especially after that exchange.

>JD: AEELNTT 8A ATE +27 157
#note it's almost crazy that I don't have a bingo here, but this rack only bingos through B, C and D and she blocked my C. I ran very low on time after this move. Thought about just playing TYE as well which does a point better. Clear winner is LAYETTE - the bag is pretty favorable, which makes taking the points preferable.
>Diana_Grosman: U N14 U. +4 128
>JD: EELNRTT M6 NETTLER +65 222
#note I have TRENCHANT here as well. I was debating between that and TRANCHANT* being the spelling, but fortunately it didn't matter.

#note trying to constrict the board

#note keeping an I is competitive.
>Diana_Grosman: DEINS 15F DISEN..... +48 199
#note wow! I'd been writing down the extensions I could come up with, but this hadn't occurred to me. I thought of a few: BACCHANT, PENCHANT and TRENCHANT. There's also MERCHANT, COUCHANT and one other gorgeous 5-letter extension.
>JD: ?EFOOTW L4 WOOF +27 267
#note the other option is PLAINCHANT, which trip payne, my next opponent, knew. Meanwhile, here I make a significant error that would've entirely changed the game. blame time pressure, but there's no reason for me not to find WEBFOOT.
>Diana_Grosman: AEILNOS 14B ANISOLE +77 276
>JD: ?DEIOOT 15A TIED +30 297
#note uhoh. I was under huge time pressure here, unfortunately. However, my play wins by a mile.
>Diana_Grosman: EW K5 WE +23 299
>JD: ?EILOOP O8 LOOPIEs. +81 378
#note it's funny, the second I plugged the rack in I thought of EOLOPILE. blame time pressure yet again. However, this does pretty much clinch the game, which is good enough for me.
>Diana_Grosman: AGJS E11 JAG. +24 323
>JD: ABDGIMO 3G M.D +23 401
#note  just trying to score and not empty the bag. However, quackle says that I suck and should play GAMBADO through the A. I was just trying to get a play down, but yeah, GAMBADO is nice. I wish there were an actual preendgame solver for 3 in the bag endgames...
>Diana_Grosman: EINQTU 12A QUIN.TE +52 375
#note she has this play up top as well!
>JD: ABBGIOS 1H .BB +17 418
#note it gets very ugly here. I didn't see FEZ and I had like 30 seconds for my endgame...
>Diana_Grosman: HZ 7L ..Z +15 390
>JD: AGIOS M1 AGIO +15 433
#note my out is blocked!
>Diana_Grosman: H A7 H.. +9 399
>Diana_Grosman:  (S) +2 401
#note I lose ten points on time as well. Not my finest late-game sequence.
