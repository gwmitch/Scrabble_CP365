#note there were several similar plays to choose from here.  This and L11 HOY 34 are rated tops by the static evaluator.  I didn't like the idea of keeping the F and the V together.

#note ouch.  I had my eye on this spot the last 2 turns but couldn't justify playing there.

#note I saw this coming.  A great play that shuts down all remaining bingo lanes (and a good thing because it blocked TUMORAL)
>Brad_W.: ALMORTU 14B R.ALM +26 319
#note I threw in the towel here.  Any fishing play would have blocked by her.

#note I considered a 1 tile fish but when I looked at the unseen pool, I decided she was almost certain to use the opening herself to bingo out.
