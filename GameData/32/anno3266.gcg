#note In retrospect, I'm pretty sure KEF is the best play. This is ridiculous, but I can actually force a tie in this game by constricting his C and V plays and hoping Lloyd makes a mistake. The two-highest scoring plays available to Lloyd after KEF are FED 13I and EF 15H, and both of them give me a fighting chance -- if he plays FED, I play RENT F5 blocking REC or REV, and he's forced to play off the C and V one at a time with VULVA 11B and DOC K13. Meanwhile, I score points with FIB 15M and BAP J7 to force a 442-442 tie. If he plays EF after my KEF, then I have PINT/PYA at 12G, and all I have to do is play off my B next turn (look at 7G) and I win. KEF can backfire if Lloyd responds with CLEF I12, though -- then he has DEV/VULVA for a pretty out-in-two sequence. The frustrating part is that Lloyd later admitted he didn't see VULVA! I could easily have stolen this game, especially because he was fairly low on time.
