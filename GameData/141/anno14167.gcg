#note gazer sims a little worse because it gives back more points next turn but the volatilty is exactly what I need. I could also just take the points for DAZES but GV is dreadful.

#note the major turning point of the game...I saw OUTSCREAM and then dismissed it as ridiculous. But in reality, given the game situation I need something ridiculous to have a shot, like him challenging a valid 9 - additionally, other words like OUTYELP, OUTYELL, OUTSHOUT etc. are all good. even after OUTSCREAM I am listed with an 8% win chance, which is hardly huge, but it is something.

#note unfortunately his last play took out UNWISER. not sure what to do, creating a better lane seemed pretty reasonable though...maybe just take the points for wivern?

#note First turn requiring any thought at all. I kept staring at OILY and couldn't bring myself to play something else but then snapped out of it.
