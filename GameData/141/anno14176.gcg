#note That's funny.  I mean, I made the right play, but Quackle only recommends five plays.  Oh well, I guess the short list means there wasn't much to do with this rack.  Moving on.

#note Worst play in the game.  I knew this play was bad.  But I was blind to an alternative.  I also missed a bingo, but I'm not mad because it's not in my range yet.

>Tasha: ?EILSVW 14G SWIVELs +79 279
#note I thought hard about this play.  Should I play SWIVEL at O10 keeping the blank or should I just take the bingo?  Sim says I made the right play, but SWIVEL is only two points behind.  If I could do it all over again, I think I'll play O10 instead.  I was really thinking about it.  The bingo doesn't put me ahead by much AND there's still a blank unseen.

#note Just playing L9 FIND would've made this game so much easier.  It doesn't open the board and it keeps an AENT leave.  I saw the play, but I was just being greedy.  Quackle takes off only two points, but I think it should take off eight.

#note #1 G3 VEX:  I was so depressed because I can't block his bingos on row 2/row 5.  Who the hell gets an end rack of ?AELRST anyway?  I looked for a block for about five minutes, but couldn't find one.  So then I gave up and was ready to play L9 NIXE.   But then a little voice told me "Block his bingos, Tasha." Me: "I can't jerk.  Can't you see it's unblockable?" Evil Tasha: "Whatever you do, don't play NIXE!  Block it!!"  Me: "I CAN'T! Whatever, man, I'm playing NIXE.  It's 23 points!"  ET: "It's 24 points, you poor excuse of a Scrabble player. And don't play it.  You'll lose for sure."   Me:  "Why do you want me to play VEX so badly? Wait...VEX! That's the play!  WOHOOO!! That's the block! I'M A FREAKING GENIUS! I'M BRILLIANT!! I'm-"  ET: "..an idiot.  You don't even see URALITES, but because you're not even looking there,  maybe he isn't either."  Me and Evil Tasha went back and forth for a few minutes, and I was eventually convinced to play VEX out of sheer spite.  Weird gamble, but whatever.  I have nothing to lose.
