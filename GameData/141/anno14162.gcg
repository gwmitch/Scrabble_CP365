#note I didn't seriously consider 5H JAB, but I *average* 81 points on my next turn after that play! I did consider TAJ vs. JUBAS. I'm a little surprised that I did pick JUBAS. Although the S isn't great here, I think TAJ was the play.

#note Who would play 2L YIN here? My knee-jerk reaction was that it was a crazy play, but it's possible that it's harder to fit heavy hitting plays up there than I thought. Still, I really don't mind IVY or TIVY in this situation.
