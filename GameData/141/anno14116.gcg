#note Easy start.
>Mark_Schmidt: INOW G10 WINO +13 13
>Siddharth_Murali: HPT H13 PHT +28 94
#note Didn't see the HAIRLINE hook, but doesn't matter since I had only one vowel. This should be best.
>Mark_Schmidt: AABIOST 6F AI.BOATS +64 77
>Siddharth_Murali: BEVY -  +0 94
#note I don't know why I challenged AIRBOATS. I'd gone through a bunch of AIR- words that morning and don't remember AIRBOATS. I guess I thought it was two words.

>Siddharth_Murali: GMO 3L MOG +16 188
#note By now I was out of it. I opened with a bingo but still fell to a 100 point deficit. I did also have the S and the E this turn, so at least I could open two new lanes with this play.
>Mark_Schmidt: NTV 8L V.NT +33 288
>Siddharth_Murali: ARW 11E WA.R +34 222
#note I thought this was a clever play. I just needed to put points on the board.
>Mark_Schmidt: AENORSU O6 OU.EARNS +59 347
#note :)
>Siddharth_Murali: EIM 8A EMI. +24 246
#note Had to open another lane.
>Mark_Schmidt: EZ 6B ZE. +37 384
#note Sigh.
>Siddharth_Murali: ?AEINOS 2G ANOmIES +63 309
#note This isn't a good play, but I just went with the first thing I saw *bad habit*... toenails is best down at H15, followed by a series of bingos at the K8 spot. *facepalm*
>Mark_Schmidt: ERX 3E REX +35 419
>Siddharth_Murali: HIPT 1G PITH +51 360
#note Just needed to keep scoring.

#note Well played to Mark. I tried my best to dig out of a hole but fell short. I guess this was his revenge after our first two intense nailbiters!
