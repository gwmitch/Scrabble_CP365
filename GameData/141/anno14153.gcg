#note I saw an easy 35 at 1A with JET.  but that left me with a horrible leave...then saw J(UP)ON as a possiblity with 5 o's in the bag.

#note That was the moment of truth...  I spent several minutes on hold wanting to challenge.  I was hesitant about winning this game because my rating would jump over 1400 and then I would be forced to play in division 2.  So many things going on in my mind.  If I challenged and was wrong, he'd go out and my cum would suffer and I would be worse off against the other players who finished 4-4.  If I was right, I might win the game, and had to play div. 2.  So I let it go and hoped to keep the score close.  Really shaky with some of these pseudo-scientific words.  I realize if I had correctly challenged and drew the d and ?, I would have won easily; If I had challenged correctly and drawn the o and ?, the road to winning would have been more difficult but possible.  At least I put up more of a fight than the previous game.  That was an ugly game!
