#note I should have traded down to 2 consonants and one vowel, or maybe even just two consonants. This was my worst game of BAT, I'm not really as bad as I'm about to play!

#note Sim likes 9I DONATED but after responses at 8L, many of which could be nasty, I'm left with a pretty bad board to score on and probably even bingo on unless I get one down immediately. I prefer ADDITION.

#note Yes, I exchanged here instead of playing a 33 point play holding DEVS. I just flat out missed it. Also, many other candidate plays are superior to exchanging - I guess I hadn't changed my mindset from when I was down 80-90 to now. A lapse in concentration.

#note I missed 6I DWINED and E7 WASTED, assuming that playing shorter was the way to go. I think better than both of those is C5 DEW, which doesnt close lines like CWM does and gets me 13 more points, although at the cost of my vowel. 11H GOWD is also a much better version of CWM.

#note Fishing one tile would've been more intriguing if there were actually bingos I can hit in the pool - I knew there were none, but saw no other good options. This is actually a cool position, though. Only two plays ever win here according to Championship Player: 11K VISE (11.11%) and L11 AIVER (2.78%). VISE is awesome because if I draw the D and another letter making a 6, Chris is suddenly in a bind, because I'll have two spots to go out. If I draw BD I squeak out a win, in fact, with two spots for ABIDER and no way for Chris to block while also shedding the Q. Drawing FD can be countered with (RED)UB or 7M NUB. Even if I draw QD I give myself two spots for QAID after VISE (the other one being N2). I think I had plenty of time to come up with something cool, but VISE didn't occur to me.
