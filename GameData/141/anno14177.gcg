#note Tasha at BAT - Episode 2  -  Favorite Play #2
>Tasha: ADENTTT 9C TAT +10 10
#note I DID miss something through the U.  I looked for about a minute.  I don't like my play.  I'm still learning about racks like these:  what to fish and how many tiles to fish off.  Quackle suggests fishing off a single T.

#note I saw none of the plays at row 10.  I suck.  I need to work on my board vision.  I like 2B MOXIE best, though.

#note I almost played CUM (sim winner), but decided to be a little defensive intead of fishing.   If he bingos, it's more likely to be on column B or column N and that leaves big comebacks for me because I'm going to draw a blank and a Z since I just turned over six tiles.  If he DOESN'T bingo, then he's going to make a short play on row 10...and that's going to block more of his bingo lanes.

#note The plays I considered were 12H OTHER and MONTH and I passed them both up.  I'm not trying to open up any more lanes.

#note #2:  David holds my play, but rightfully decides not to challenge (it turns out that he wasn't sure of either word.  RATTOON has multiple spellings).  Before this tournament, I did a massive review of everything I know, including the fours.  I paid extra attention to the hooks and I definitely remember CRED takes an A.  Funny thing is, I know ACRED is good, but it still wouldn't have occured to me to stick an A in front of CRED.  This is my second favorite play of the tournament because had I not reviewed stuff, I would have been upset that I couldn't play my bingo.

>Tasha: ?EGIOTZ 2I .ZOTEs +68 352
#note I went back and forth between ZOO and burning the blank for 68 to solidify the win.  Burning the blank sims best but if I'm going to do that I should play AZOTIC instead.

#note David has a 72 point play here.   I was wondering why Quackle recommended a measly four point play and  why I was only at 80% to win after FE.
