#note I downright MISSED this bingo.  I only completely missed ONE seven (of the sevens I've studied)  all year and now I have missed two.  The sad part is I wrote down APERIENT and PERINEAL (seriously???) on my score sheet.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot

#note UNACCEPTABLE!!!  This is the last time I'm missing a seven.  This is the SECOND time I missed this word. As coincidence would have it, EYEHOLE was the only seven I missed completely all year before PERINEA and both times the blank needed to be the Y.   I'm working on my blank vision immediately.
