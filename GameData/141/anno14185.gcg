>Juraj_Pivovarov: GLUY 8F UGLY +16 16
>Matthew_Larocque: ADHNOST F3 HANDO.TS +68 68
#note I had been hoping he'd play a U, but I didn't think it would actually happen. THO(U)SAND scores 72.  U is the only letter that makes a bingo with this rack!
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AACIRST 3C ARC.AIST +80 96
#note Juraj was unsure, but I've seen this one recently. Good find!
>Matthew_Larocque: AMOUWXY D1 WO.MY +34 102
#note I saw OX(I)M after I hit the clock. Not good. AX(I)OM too, even.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EEFRZ H1 FR.EZE +57 153
#note And this doesn't come down.... but seems like he missed FR(I)Z!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ANSTUX I5 AX +29 131
>Juraj_Pivovarov: CEIT 6H ..CITE +21 174
>Matthew_Larocque: ?NSSTUW L4 UN.WiSTS +70 201
#note UNWiS(E)ST also plays for 72, but even if I had seen that it looks pretty dangerous. Juraj did hold this but accepted.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: JU 11J JU. +20 194
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEEOP E5 OE +19 220
#note I decided to hold off on the D hook, but this REALLY ruined the game for me. I need to just play PEED or something, it's not even that dangerous. Seriously Matt.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: DDEIIO N2 IODIDE +45 239
#note 45 for a crappy rack.... yeesh.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAADEEP 9H AA +11 231
#note Barf. And missed playing off more vowels through the R up top.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: BFU O7 FUB +29 268
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEEIPR E10 APE +12 243
#note DRA(W)EE , which I don't think I knew, is the only play that scores well here. (J)APE seemed futile. Either way I need a quick bingo.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ?GHIORV 12B HOV.RInG +78 346
#note Blowout.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEEINP H12 .EEP +15 258
#note Dunno, I think I'm sunk.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: AQT M1 QAT +30 376
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIINNO 13A ION +15 273
#note You're kidding? That word is a verb? AARRGHH. Sad face.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: EIINORT 15H .OINTIER +83 459
#note Yep.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEIKLNO 1A KNO. +33 306
#note Saw 14J KOI but not KOEL.
>Juraj_Pivovarov: ABEM 14J BEAM +32 491

#note -30. Quite a depressing game.
