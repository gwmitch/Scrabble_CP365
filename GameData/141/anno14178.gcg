#note Didn't see ITERUM o8. Played MUSO# pretty quickly. MUSO# still feels right. FWIW this was the penultimate round and I was behind Wapnick (whom I played for first in the last game) in spread.

#note ELOGIST# is significantly worse because it gives back JIZ#. I didn't give it much thought, just took LOGIEST for the points.
