#note Haha.
>Ryan_Fischer: FGMNORU 1G FUG +28 331
#note I played FUG 'cause I have the last R.  Who knows, it could come in handy.  Plus, I slow the game down a tiny bit.

#note COMA surrenders.  I don't need to do so just yet.  Champ agrees, but suggests MOO.  I guess I can at least come back with CONE if I draw an E, saving the C.  COMA was a lot of points to pass up, but spread wasn't a concern here.
