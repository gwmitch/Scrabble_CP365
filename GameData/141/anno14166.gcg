>Scott: DGIU 9E GUID +17 17
>Will: EENSSST J6 NESS +17 37
#note This turn really threw me for a loop...NESS is not the right way to go here. Nothing about GUID indicates that I need to go for a less aggressive option like NESS. First of all, ESS would've been better than NESS both for a better/stabler leave and creating a lane with a hook that I have. I think the best play here is GUIDES, which leaves Scott a truly terrible board to work with and allows me to gun for bingos hooking S/KI. I8 FES is also a nice option, ensuring two more lanes besides the SKI lane. I7 EFS sims well, but could quickly backfire after a defensive play hooking REFS. I can make better plays in situations like this.
>Scott: AFOY K9 OFAY +22 39
>Will: EEEOSTU E8 O.EE +10 47
#note Not quite ready to blow it up with OUTSEE, and I liked the new lane afforded by OGEE. EYE also sims well and is worth consideration. I might have misevaluated the strength of ESTU compared to EOSTU.

>Scott: IJ 6B JI. +27 134
>Will: EEINNRW L11 WEN +27 145
#note Missed L9 NEWER. I liked WEN keeping a decent bingo leave with an R in it for HARANGUER, but NEWER is clearly superior, scoring way more and drawing two more tiles with many more Ds to draw and Rs to redraw for that attractive spot.

>Scott: ABIMRU D10 BARIUM +32 286
>Will: CIOPRWX 15A CRI.P +33 318
#note An interesting move. I waffled between CRIMP and E2 PLOW. E2 PLOW leaves the triple lane alone, but I will probably get a C11 X play with most draws. On the other hand with CRIMP, I'll almost certainly have E3 LOX. I think on this board, row 15 might be the second or third scariest scoring threat available, so maybe the sim-winning C11 WOP is fine to score well and ensure a wealth of scoring opportunities will remain for me next turn. In most instances here I will need a two or three turn scoring barrage to keep up with a HARANGUE hook play and then a high scoring play in one of the other spots.
>Scott: BMO C11 MOB +29 315
>Will: DEIOVWX N2 VOWED +48 366
#note It occurred to me after I played VOWED that WIVED was definitely better. WIVED does set up the S hook there, but there's already an S hook down low that will hurt if Scott can bingo with it. The S is already powerful on this board, but playing VOWED turns the A, another tile I don't have, into a similarly powerful tile, with so many strong scoring plays to be made along row 1. 
>Scott: DIZ H1 DI.Z +72 387
>Will: INNOSTX E3 .OX +40 406
#note 2A AX to retain my O is best. NITONS hits bingos with 5/14 of the unseen tiles (AEEOR)  hooking WEN/S, and 4/14 unseen tiles from the I of QADI (CLLL), for a total of 9/14.
>Scott: CEHLNP 3L CL.P +16 403
>Will: INNOSTT 10D ..NT +19 425
#note As it happened neither of the two tiles I drew would've connected had I drawn them individually after AX. Again, fishing to NITONS is best. I basically lucked out here, after making second and third best plays on many of the most pivotal turns.
>Scott: EEHLLNY 13C ..LLY +14 417
#note In time trouble, Scott overlooks my sneakier second bingo. He has no wins anyway, with my NORIAS 1J looming.
