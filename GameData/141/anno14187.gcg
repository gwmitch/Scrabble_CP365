#note awkward position with no great plays..I spotted SHMO which sims best but I didn't like giving up cheap points. About 20 plays sim within 3 points of the top here.

#note probably sacrificed too many points here but I loved taking a shot at BAIZA (or ZEBRA or something) rather than just burning the Z now and giving her new lanes.

#note oh NO! now that I look at this now, I immediately see the possibility of FUGITIVELY...

#note for fun I went through and had it sim every play for 1000 iterations...plays like CONGII and NIOBIC do jump up a lot. To me the G was the most dangerous lane on the board, but there's only one I and one N left so this is likely an overreaction. I could just take the points for OTIC at 10A but I really like EXOTIC at M6 which blocks her best lane on column N and flips over some tiles as well.
