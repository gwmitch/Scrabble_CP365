#note Lots of very close options here. I don't think WIT is the best of them. WILT is better because it can't be hooked with an E to clog up the lane the way WIT can, though I also bingo slightly less frequently compared to WIT. Best for bingoing is J8 LAW, keeping TIRLS, but 4C/1V leaves are a little risky. I thought WIT was a good way to split the difference between those two plays, but I should have picked J8 LAW or WILT instead. J4 LAW looks OK at first to make a new hook, but I don't really need a new one on this board, it hooks with too much other stuff, and I can do better than STIR as a leave.
>Stefan: MOOT J3 TOOM +23 104
>Will: ALLRSUZ 7H ZA +29 70
#note LUTZ was tempting, but ZA has to be better. 3J TZAR to shed one more tile is also an option, but I think ZA is fine.

>Will: LLORRSU -LLORU +0 70
#note Exchanging this turn is unnecessary. TRULL would have worked fine.

>Will: AHNOQRR 4L HORN +26 156
#note HORN and HOAR sim very closely, with HORN slightly ahead,  but HOAR does offer the followup possibility of N2 TRANQ with a T draw.
