#note I seriously considered LED instead of LEY, but only because I felt the Y would help me score next turn with all those consonants - not because it guaranteed me SYNTH, because I missed it completely. Had I seen that I think I would've done LED for sure.

#note Tempting to play from the Z, but only 6 more points for such an inferior leave was unappealing. I would still have tempo after most of Cesar's plays from the Z, too.

#note NEE might be correct here given the exchange - regardless of whether Cesar passed 5 vowels (likely) or 5 consonants (not as likely), playing shorter leaving ANSSU is a hedge against nasty draws. Opening row 4 doesn't factor much into the decision, as it's not a real threat.

#note Blocking the only out without seeing if it worked out better to just let him have it. Playing at 14M for 19 is best.
