#note quackle likes BAN at D11 to avoid giving up cheap points but retain my bingo lanes, I think I agree
>Evans: ADKY 14B DA.KY +42 148
>JD: AAFHNNT B6 FA.TH +27 74
#note tough call, FAITH and HAFT both block up good lanes. ultimately it seemed like I couldn't afford to clog the right side, and FAITH does create a hard-to-hit but high-scoring lane on A

>JD: AEILNNT K5 NA +15 89
#note I was pretty stumped here...gotta draw the game out if I want any chance whatsoever of winning. maybe just fish the N and shoot for column A?

#note not sure I get this play, maybe he already had an S?
>JD: EHNOPQS O7 QOPHS +67 224
#note now even though I used my S I still have a beautiful S hook lane

#note I saw RECALLED if I feel like taking the points and conceding the game, but it seemed worth prolonging the game one last time to see if I could hit column A.
>Evans: EGINOO A1 NOOGIE +32 409
#note evans did a great job of turning over tiles and shorting the game. with a big lead you want the game to be over as fast as possible.
>JD: ACDELOU D1 CEDULA +32 309
#note pretty clear that I'm toast, just trying to block bingoes he might have. sims miles ahead on valuation.
