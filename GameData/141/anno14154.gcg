#note here's where I get the x and held onto it until the last move.  That's 10 moves! That takes talent.  What was I thinking!  Ugh!  Opponent never gave me an oppotunity for a x bomb.

#note getting really paranoid!  I thought he's find something by now.  had i tracked better, i could have set up the x quite nicely off of zoon with xis at n1.  I had the lone i, lone u and 1 blank.  instead i pick a weak play.
