#note I actually like FIL quite a bit here.  We're going to probably going to be clearing in the bottom left for a while, and I need some hope after that clearing stage is over.  Upon hindsight Quackle probably would have taken care of this for me, but most good opponents wouldn't.  Any other play is a disaster for the long term character of this board.

#note I kind of just ignored the S implication from last play.  I just don't see any way to win if the S isn't in the bag, and I thought maybe Quackle was making a fancy play with the W or H and didn't have the other S.  Not likely though.
