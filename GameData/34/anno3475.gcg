#note Not a good play. Wanted to create turnover and play for the ? or an S, but I didn't see MUDRA 6B. Keeping AMR is also much better in terms of exchanges. I don't like playing with something like ARUM F11 or DUMA 6C.

#note COMB 14H 25 isn't bad, but I'm not really sure. Keeping M or CMO might be better. Would you trade or play COMB?

#note HILT 14H sims better. Liked being volatile here.

#note Champ Player likes MU B6?? I figured he was bingoing anyway, so I just went for the points.
