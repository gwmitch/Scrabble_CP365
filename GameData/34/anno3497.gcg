#note He took a while on this play. Notice he passed up FORMANTS for six more points.
>Sam_Rosin: ADEHIMT H1 HAME +41 69
#note :( HEMATOID still doesn't look that familiar.

#note Quackle doesn't love it, but I certainly liked this play at the time. WACKO certainly looks better, though. Plays like WEAK, WOK, and WOKE for more points are simming best, but I don't know about them against Gibson. Thoughts?

#note Time to make something happen--both blanks are out, but he'd have to make one an S if he has one, and JUST doesn't mean he definitely has one or anything.
