>JD: GIRSSTU 8G RUG +8 8
#note (Dallas Open 2009 Round 3) I didn't want to put an S out there for DD to use.
>DD: AAMNY 7F YAMAN +23 23
#note I was suspicious of this; I knew MAYAN, but was not sure of this. It did give me a nice answer.
>JD: AIJSSTY 6G JAY +35 43
#note Still suspicious of YAMAN, otherwise I might have played JAYS for more
>DD: CEIL 9D CEIL +19 42
>JD: ?AISSST K5 ASSISTs +85 128
#note 15 points higher than any bingo that forms real words. It stayed on the board, so I guess YAMAN* is good [it's not]
>DD: EHLV E8 H.LVE +22 64
>JD: BEEEINO D6 NIE.E +16 144
#note I totally did not see the front hook to ASSISTS. Otherwise, 4J OBE is nice. [I didn't see the hook all game; later when speaking to GT about the bingo he immediately asked about bassists.
>DD: ADIIO 13C OIDIA +27 91
>JD: BEENOTT 12D B.T +20 164
>DD: ADER 8K .RADE +21 112
>JD: EENNOPT 14F PEN +24 188
#note Missed a bingo at N8 here
>DD: EEGO 15H OGEE +21 133
>JD: EENOOTT E4 TOE +8 196
#note Perhaps I should have played 7M TOO.
>DD: AZ 7M ZA +45 178
>JD: AENOOTU 14J ONTO +12 208
>DD: AELT C4 TEAL +11 189
>JD: AELQUUW L1 QUALE +50 258
>DD: EX 9K .EX +47 236
#note My comfort after QUALE is immediately gone.
>JD: DFGSTUW 3K W.FT +20 278
>DD: IKR B4 IRK +39 275
#note I think DD said he kept OPH here, thinking I'd take the volatile A1 spot, and he'd get to play QOPH next.
>JD: ?DGISUV 1L .UID +42 320
#note But I have a U and the 1L spot scores more without burning an S.
>DD: HOOP A1 POOH +49 324
#note A worthy alternative to QOPH
>JD: ?DGRRSV 10C V..D +19 339
>DD: MNOW 14A MOWN +28 352
>JD: ?BGIRRS A11 BRI.S +30 369
#note My time was low here, so I quickly took BRIMS.
>DD: CFINRU 15M FUN +23 375
>JD: ?GR 2A .GRe +8 377
#note I missed the higher scoring O column hooking ZA due to time trouble.
>JD:  (CIR) +10 387
