#note Yes, I missed MANATEES.  You may proceed to laugh hysterically.  This is one of my times where I run through the 8s, see that N has EMANATES and run through other letters, haphazardously forgetting that, oh, some words have multiple anagrams.

#note The point of this play is to block BEGORRAH, hence the sacrificed points.  Leaving 4 in the bag does a little bit better if there's a miracle out there, but I don't see anything.  It also increases my spread if Quackle decides to open as a diversion or something.

#note For what it's worth, I miss the second best bingo here same time next week.  Probably costs me the game too.  I promise that as this series goes on that I won't miss 8 zillion bingos all the time.  It comes out to 1 out of every 15 games or so: they're just concentrated very early because of the time restraint, interface, etc.  I think if I were to start another 500 game set I'd miss fewer bingos.
