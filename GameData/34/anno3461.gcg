#note Disappointing start, to have a nongo on my first rack.

#note Didn't even pause to consider a challenge of this phony.

#note So close to being able to play PURFLING, which would have won the PURPLE word for sure. I decide to turn over some tiles, but the best moves all center around the G column or row 7. 7E FIL said to be best. G7 F(AW)N(E)R is the top scoring play.

#note Ouch.
>Steve: CELMSTW K13 CWM +17 302
#note I took way too long to make this play, which put me in time trouble. Best is 7F ITEM. About eight points of equity loss.
>Chuck: BEIRST O1 TRIBES +39 344
>Steve: ELMOSTU J14 OM +19 321
#note 15G OLEUM wins at 58 percent clip. Nothing else comes close, and 7H EMUS is the only other play that wins as much as 40 (44) percent of the time. A 13 point equity error.

#note C-player likes QUA, and most every point scoring play isn't on the Duck's list. It also likes 7E OIL. This basically means you're going to have to bingo to win. My play offers too many easy responses from the opponent. I didn't want to empty the bag, or I would have opted for something along row 5, like STELA, which scores better and gives less back. After the game I thought one of the few chances to steal a win was to play off the S, and hope to draw the B for QUOTABLE. That seemed too hopeful.
>Chuck: AAER O12 AREA +39 410
#note Ouch one more time.
>Steve: BELOOSU 7I BU. +18 367
>Chuck: AAIO J10 O.A +13 423
>Steve: ELOOS C1 LOO.S +10 377
#note Missing an out play along row 15. Time trouble (I went two minutes over) is my excuse.
