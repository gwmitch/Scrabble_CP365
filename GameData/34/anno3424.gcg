#note woohoo! i made the right play. i was fairly cognizant of the strength of this rack after that AEGLNOR debacle (where the top play is -O)

#note i wasn't even sure about HEADWEAR, let alone an S hook. but i also thought FIRINGS was phony (i was thinking about HIRINGS*). judy has a rule for the -WEAR words, basically none of them take an S except for the verbs and LOUNGEWEAR/SPORTSWEAR.

#note how did i convince myself resistor didn't fit? the mistakes start small. i thought i was on fire. (-2)

#note yep, i'm starting to play terrible. am i actually trying to fish for a bingo? i hope i wouldn't do this in a tourney, at the very least this game was very educational for never doing this again. 14A ADVERT is fine. or DROVE or anything there. (-8)

#note no!!! just play freaking ranch! quackle likes N2 RAZE, i NEVER think of stuff like that. also HANCE, which i didn't think about, and LAZE, which i DID think about. why am i fishing? (-11.5)
>Roy: DEW H1 WE.D +30 409
>Cesar: AACELRU 2H .AU +8 441
#note amazingly, that was kind of a blessing in disguise, because the W should be fairly hard to bingo through; i should focus below. but i looked for a long time and could not find any way to block anything! quackle's choise of LAC -- i just couldn't bring myself to do that. what about something like SEPTATE? does LAC really win 98.4% of endgames? i have to give roy something better than a random rack.... but don't know what the right play is. it sure as hell isn't what i played, though. (-23%) i did want to play CRAZE. almost anything is better than what i played.
>Roy: AENPPTU 14A PETNAP +43 452
>Cesar: ACELRTV -  +0 441
#note basically excitement from bingoing 4 times early and momentum made me play horribly carelessly towards the end. i actually thought i was gonna win and pull another bingo out of the bag. let this be a lesson! (although who am i trying to teach, i'm sure anyone reading this wouldn't have screwed up this game half as bad as i did). oh, i knew PETNAP, but i had no other way to win.
