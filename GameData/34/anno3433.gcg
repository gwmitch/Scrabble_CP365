>Jason: ADHIORY 8D HAIRY +30 30
#note Missed a bunch of better plays, like HYOID, HYDRIA and HOARY. (-6.4)
>Stephen_Knapp: MNOW 9C MOWN +24 24
#note Blocking NONT(I)DAL and not giving me L(E)NTANDO or NONAD(U)LT. I must've sighed when Knappster hit his clock, because he said "An effective block, I see."
>Jason: ADLNNOT 10B NOD +17 47
#note Already shaping up to be a mudfest. But I didn't mind ... I like keeping the board close when I don't have good stuff and opening when I'm ready to strike. Again, missed better plays, like DONA, same spot.
>Stephen_Knapp: BDIOV 7H BOVID +19 43
>Jason: ADDLNRT K6 D.RNDL +16 63
#note "I'm running a special today on consonants if you're interested," I said. Earned an "ooh" from Knappster, even though Q likes DRAT at 6F.
>Stephen_Knapp: ?AEGNOR 12E ONAGERs +67 110
#note Earning mock applause from me. Passing on M1 bingos for defensive purposes.
>Jason: ACEOPTW 11E WOP +32 95
#note Didn't know COWPEA, which plays at 13B. But this is close. (-1.0)
>Stephen_Knapp: EILSU M3 LIEUS +25 135
>Jason: ABCEJTX L2 JAB +34 129
#note I can play great defense when behind.
>Stephen_Knapp: EEFLT 13C FLEET +33 168
>Jason: ACEOSTX 6K .O.X +31 160
#note "I see I'll have to use my strategy against Zeigler and just high-point you to death," I said. (I left out that my leave was primed to bingo along row 14 soon.) :)
>Stephen_Knapp: IIIIUUU -IIIIUUU +0 168
#note Knappster looked at the last one, and turned over his rack like it was diseased. "Pass seven, and four of them were I's," he said.
>Jason: ACEHSTY 6F CHAY +31 191
#note Yeah, this board's gonna get ugly.
>Stephen_Knapp: AGZ N2 ZAG +35 203
#note "What're the odds he doesn't have an A?" he asked after he hit his clock. "Not good," I answered.
>Jason: AEEFSTT O1 TAE +24 215
#note Duck likes FE at 13I over this. I disagree. (-1.0)
>Stephen_Knapp: EKU 9I KU.E +13 216
#note For one who claims that I always bank points, I'd like to know how he got 18 here. (I know, I know, tripling the K instead of doubling...)
>Jason: AEFINST I12 .F +9 224
>Stephen_Knapp: LOP 11A LOP +14 230
#note "Running out of places to score," Knappster noted.
>Jason: AEINSST 14F SEITANS +79 303
#note Gotta love the fit, although it wasn't impressive enough to stop the sarcastic "nice find".
>Stephen_Knapp: AIIT A11 .ITAI +18 248
>Jason: ACEITTU 15J TUI +11 314
#note "If you think I'm opening the board for you, you've got another think coming!" I said.
>Stephen_Knapp: EV 14A .VE +17 265
#note Even Steve Williams would find this board ugly.
>Jason: ACEGMTU 15C MEG +15 329
#note Surprised Q's plays ditch the U. I kept it for Q insurance. (-0.3, to MUG in this spot)
>Stephen_Knapp: EEORRRS F4 RE. +5 270
#note (Knappster's exact rack. He drew Q? on the pick.)
>Jason: ACEIITU 4D CU.IE +16 345
#note Setting up QAT at 3G or Q(U)A at E3 should I pick the Q, while blocking bingo hopes. Valuation leader is CERIA. (-11.4)
>Stephen_Knapp: ?EOQRRS G3 Q. +21 291
#note Best.
>Jason: AINT 11K .ATIN +5 350
>Jason: AINT --  -5 345
#note Obviously I have work to do on the fives, esp. the high-probbers. But GREEK, ROMAN, LATINIZE, LATINITY ... I thought it was good. The phony more than doubles my equity loss for the game; it's a 32-point error compared to AN(D).
>Stephen_Knapp: ?EORRS 11I RO.lERS +15 306
>Stephen_Knapp:  (AINT) +8 314
