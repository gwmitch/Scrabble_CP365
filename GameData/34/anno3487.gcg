>Sam_: ALNRSTU G8 ..LU +4 98
#note Despite opening the triple lane, ULAN 10A sims best here.

>Sam_: AKNNRST C9 .RANK +22 120
>Doug_Brockmeier: EIV 12A VI.E +22 113
>Sam_: EIJNPST -JP +0 120
#note INSTEP 14A and JINS K5 are the premier plays here. The exchange is bad, but not horrible.
>Doug_Brockmeier: ACEILOR -ACEI +0 113
>Sam_: EINNRST K2 TINNERS +76 196
>Doug_Brockmeier: AEOV 4K .OVAE +18 131
>Sam_: AABEILO 10I ABELIA +34 230
#note I think I doubted myself on OBELIA here, stupidly. OBELIA 10I is clearly better because of leave and defense, and OBIA 10I is the only other option worth considering. 
>Doug_Brockmeier: ?EGIINP O6 ImPINGE +89 220
#note Scored as 89, but faulty addition gave him 230 after this play :(
>Sam_: EINORSW 14C SNOWIER +80 310
#note Wasn't sure of ImPINGER; SNOWIER 13I is a little better. 
>Doug_Brockmeier: ADT H11 .AT.D +24 244
>Sam_: DEHNRST N2 DE.TH +47 357
>Doug_Brockmeier: EO E5 OE +9 253
>Sam_: AJNRSUZ 4E JUN +20 377
#note RAJ 4C and JUN D3 might be better.
>Doug_Brockmeier: CEMSTTU -CE +0 253
>Sam_: AACERSZ 7C ZA +26 403
#note CZAR 13L is best (again, didn't know IMPINGER). CRAZE 12K is another good option.
>Doug_Brockmeier: CM E13 M.C +7 260
>Sam_: ACEIRRS A9 CRA.ERS +36 439
#note ARRIVE A8, VICE A12, VIER A12, and VAIR A12 all sim better, but I don't think it makes much of a difference at this point.
>Doug_Brockmeier: IT J2 IT +10 270
>Sam_: DEIMOWY 1F MOWED +37 476
#note Championship player likes YEW 1H best, and the sim liked YOWED best. I must have chickened out on YOWED.
>Doug_Brockmeier: EEILQST 13M QIS +34 304
#note STELE 2B is a few points better, setting up QI 1A.
