>Jason: ?AILRSW 8D WAILeRS +76 76
#note Like against George, opens with a ?S bingo.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EEJLOTT 9C JOLT +28 28
#note JO(S)TLE looks a little better.
>Jason: EENNOST I2 TENONE.S +61 137
#note Like against George, follow up with bango, although he blocked the double-double bango NEON(A)TES.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?BEEIKT H1 KIBE +42 70
>Jason: IIMMRSU J5 MUM. +22 159
#note "OK," I thought, "Let's see Jeff bingo on *this* board!" Sim likes (S)IM, but I loved the board after this play. (-1.5)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?ADEETU E5 DEv..UATE +86 156
#note Whoa. Sweet play from Jeff.
>Jason: DIIRRST D4 RID +14 173
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIRTUZ D11 ZA +37 193
#note Jeff was tempted to try AZURITE/(DEvALUATE)R*, but I'd have certainly booted it.
>Jason: CEINSTY 2G C..Y +17 190
#note Even if I'd thought of the INCEST anamonic (FILIAL JOY? HEY, POP, RAPE IS RAPE!), I wouldn't have seen CYSTINE or CYSTEIN. Recognize the latter from a DO bingo list. (-21.2)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EILORTU 1J OUTLIE +26 219
>Jason: AEINRST 14B ANTSIER +78 268
#note Next to us, Carolyn Easter played FABU(L)OUS as a natural and Pete Zeigler later played PETRON(EL)S. "What, is everybody at this table trying to get into the Scrabble News?" I asked. Meanwhile, I'm playing ANTSIER. "Stick to those stem bingos," Jeff joked. Stupidly missed ARS(E)NITE/(ZA)S. (-6.3)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ADHNPRW H12 WA.P +39 258
>Jason: AEIOTUV 15A VAU +22 290
#note First saw VIE there, then VIA, then this. For once, I actually listened to the "find your best play and find a better one" advice!
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DHINNOR 13G H.ND +22 280
>Jason: DEIOOOT 12H .OODIE +25 315
#note "I think we're having opposite problems here," I said as I played this.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEFINQR N8 FAQIR +48 328
#note Jeff really didn't like this play, esp. because of what happened next. I thought it was fine and worthy of the risk, esp. since I just played off five. Q suggests FAQIR at 3A as an alternative.
>Jason: AEFOPTV O4 FOVEA +60 375
#note That's how it's been going for me lately.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BEGGGNO C3 BOG +19 347
#note Yeah, Jeff drew BEGGG here. Tough draw. Star play is EGGNOG at 14J.
>Jason: CEILPRT 11J CEP +30 405
#note Missing PERL(I)TIC. I don't know what caused him to say it, but Jeff said "Chuck has taught you well, I see." (-66.4)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EEGGNRX 13L EX +41 388
>Jason: AILNRTY G6 LI.Y +31 436
#note RAL(L)Y is better. (-12.9)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EGGHNRS 14J SER +20 408
#note (T)HEGNS (or THEGN), which Jeff said he didn't know, is best, setting up the guaranteed out.
>Jason: AINORT B1 ROAN +15 451
#note Wrong order. IT first is two better.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GGHN 12B GH.. +8 416
#note Best.
>Jason: IT O10 IT +15 466
>Jason:  (GN) +6 472
