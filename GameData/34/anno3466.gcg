#note GOURDE is good. Didn't know that hook. I7 ZEE.

>Steve: CEGJMWZ F12 C.Z +34 77
#note Not knowing GOURDE bites me again. I7 JEW is best, by about 8 equity points. This was a frustrating rack, with the big scoring tiles, but not enough vowels to take full advantage of them.

#note Mistake of the game. I thought it might be good, and that Carolyn would be unlikely to challenge in any event. I played it over its anagram to prevent the easy -s hook.

#note O12 AFAR is best. I played this for the chance at scoring with the FL combination along row 14 next time.
>Carolyn: BIOT O12 OBIT +24 367

#note Wrong to empty the bag. Just play AVA.
>Carolyn: DEESU N3 SUEDE +24 391
>Steve: ?ACEILO 3B COALIE. +20 405
#note Time pressure took its toll. Thought this was going to be enough, and slapped it down with about 19 seconds left on my clock. Found the bingo in post game analysis, after about a minute. Ouch.
