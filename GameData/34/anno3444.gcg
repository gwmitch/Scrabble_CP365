>Steve: EEINOOP 8D OPINE +16 16
#note Duck likes an exchange of EOO, by a point, and prefers putting the O on the star if you play this.
>J_Fisz: JTU 7D JUT +25 25
>Steve: EEIMOOQ -EIMOOQ +0 16
#note Close between an exchange and G6 MENO. Duck likes the latter, and when exchanging tiles, keeps EMO.
>J_Fisz: LOX 9F LOX +26 51
>Steve: ADEKNTU 9B UKE +22 38
#note Big miss. JOUKED best by a ton. Chose this play to put some pressure on the opponent to do something with the A column.
>J_Fisz: EFINR A8 INFER +35 86
>Steve: ADDEINT 7H DAD +17 55
#note Embarassing miss.
>J_Fisz: AOZ K5 ZOA +30 116
>Steve: CEIINRT C9 .INETIC +26 81
#note Second best to I(O)NIC according to C player.
>J_Fisz: ERRTW 14A WR.TER +22 138
#note This was a killer because it blocked a nice 8 along row 15.
>Steve: BEEGIRS 10E BEG +18 99
>J_Fisz: ADDEILN 15E DENIAL +26 164
#note Jeff told me his leave here after the game. Turns out he missed a bingo, one that most mortals would miss.
>Steve: AEIOQRS L4 OAR +19 118
#note Hard to pass up points, but Q says the exchange is correct. Proper leave is AERS.
>J_Fisz: HMSUY 3I MUSHY +39 203
#note Another argument for exchanging tiles on my last turn.
>Steve: EINQRST 4H QI +25 143
>J_Fisz: AFG 13E FAG +19 222
>Steve: ?ENRSTW K9 WiNTERS +76 219
#note WaNTERS along row 12 is worth three more points.
>J_Fisz: EILOR 5E REOIL +26 248
>Steve: ABLOOPT J10 BOA +24 243
#note OBA J9 said to hike winning percentage by 6, to 30 percent.
>J_Fisz: ADG M5 GAD +23 271
>Steve: LNOOPTV F2 VOT. +15 258
>J_Fisz: IVY 8M IVY +33 304
#note This hook caught me by surprise. Jeff cashes in on what probably was a nice set-up on the last play.
>Steve: ?ELNOPS O5 POL.ENeS +63 321
#note Q hates emptying the bag so much that this play doesn't even show up in C-player's list of choices. It's said to win about 55 percent of the time in a sim test, and indeed that falls well short of the 78-79 percent winning chances of J1 OPUS.  J2 PUS is next, and wins about 77 percent of the time.
>J_Fisz: AACEEIS 12F CASE..E +29 333
#note Jeff finds the game winning play. Nice.
>Steve: HMTU N11 HUM +14 335
>J_Fisz: AI M13 AI +12 345
>J_Fisz:  (T) +2 347
