>George_Viebranz: IIIII -IIIII +0 0
>Jason: AHSUUVW 8D WUSHU +30 30
#note George's "pass five" was music to my ears, as it let me get 30 out of a UUVW rack. Almost everybody who observed the winning board first said: "Ooh! WUSHU!" I may have lost, but I played the coolest word! :)
>George_Viebranz: IQ F6 QI. +32 32
>Jason: AEEHINV D8 .AIVE +22 52
#note I considered Q's pick in IN(W)EAVE, but didn't deem the extra four points worth it. Apparently the HEN and H leave are about even. (-4.0)
>George_Viebranz: AENU 6F .UEAN +16 48
>Jason: EHIMNTW 5H WHIM +36 88
#note Eventually I will play a word not starting with W.
>George_Viebranz: ADILP 4J PALID +25 73
#note A good Freudian would say I subconsciously let this phony go because I wanted George to win. I hate arguing with Freudians ... how can I disprove what was going on in my subconscious? I know George knows his fives well, better than me. ADILP looked semi-familiar, but for PLAID, not this.
>Jason: EEELNTT 3K TELE +22 110
#note Another reason I didn't give PALID* a second look was because it gave me a better spot to play off EELT.
>George_Viebranz: AACU 11D .ACUA +20 93
#note Blocked bingo no. 1: OVE(R)LENT.
>Jason: ELNORTV H11 .VERT +36 146
#note D'oh. T(A)VERN instead. Too satisfied with this. (-3.8)
>George_Viebranz: AK C9 KA +24 117
#note Ruh-roh. Shoulda known those power tiles would've stay hidden forever.
>Jason: AEJLNOY 7I JAY +48 194
#note At this point, despite a bunch of power tiles unseen, I love my position. Up a bingo without having to bingo, a good leave for eights through AVERT. Q likes JEON better, which surprises me. (-2.3)
>George_Viebranz: EILOOST 4B STOOLIE +73 190
#note At the time, I didn't notice that STOOLIE or OSTIOLE hooked to JAY for seven more.
>Jason: EEILNOR 8K OLEIN +23 217
#note Boy, I didn't know what to do here. Glad Q supports my decision, although I hate telegraphing that I don't have an S or blank.
>George_Viebranz: ?INOPRR B8 PORNIeR +82 272
#note Ruh-roh. I'm starting to sense this slipping away.
>Jason: EEGRSTZ N7 R.TZ +33 250
#note I took a while on this play, but should've taken longer. Q likes Z(ED) ... I considered it, but didn't see playable eights with, say, an O pick. But I do have bingos with a lot of other draws. I don't know. I finally said "Oh, f*ck it, just play something, I'm tired of looking at this rack." Gotta stop doing that. (-8.4)
>George_Viebranz: ARX A13 RAX +33 305
>Jason: DEEGNOS C13 GED +19 269
#note With only nine vowels among 27 unseen tiles, I'm very loath to play EGO at A6. GO at A7 looks palatable, though. (-6.9)
>George_Viebranz: EGG 3C EGG +20 325
>Jason: BENOOOS A6 BOO +27 296
#note At least I can play off the BOO "f*** you" draw. But I'm quickly running out of time (or tiles, more accurately).
>George_Viebranz: AMNY 11K MANY +35 360
#note Blocked bingo no. 2: (L)OONIEST. Maybe I could've won this game with better play, but I just think I wasn't meant to. It was George's time.
>Jason: EINOOST O1 NOS +14 310
#note Desperation time. Didn't feel like I could just fish, else George closes down the bottom. If he has ?S, I'm probably cooked anyway ... let's assume I'll draw one, which makes my EIOT leave OK. Q's clear pick is (N)OO at M11. But again, I don't see how that wins. (-26.8)
>George_Viebranz: ?DEFNST 13E iNF.STED +66 426
#note I was resigned to my fate. "Where's Pianowski?" I asked. "He does a better Bill Raftery than me. The dagger!"
>Jason: BCEFIOT 2A FOB +21 331
#note Minus ten for not playing FOCI at 14K. BCF was kind of "f*** you" draw no. 2. Again, though, I couldn't be happier that George won. Knappster was playing Easter next to us and upon finding the result, asked: "Is this your first Division 1 multi-day win?" I butted in. "First one ever," I said. "I got him in that Fenton open (Sept. 2007) where we were the only 5-1s. In Hudson (in Jan.), I was the only 6-0 and he was the only 5-1. I could've tanked it and he would've been in the final. The 560 game a couple rounds ago. (Knappster played Easter next door then, too.)" I paused. "Yeah, if he'd won this, I wasn't going to be his friend anymore," George said. He was joking (I think), but even if he hadn't hated me, I'd have hated me.
>George_Viebranz: DEIR 15H .IRED +8 434
#note He beat Paul Epstein, Chuck Armstrong, Steve Grob, Dan Pratt and myself. His low game was 368 and he averaged 436. And given my decidedly mediocre play, I think it's obvious who deserved it more. Congrats again, man.
