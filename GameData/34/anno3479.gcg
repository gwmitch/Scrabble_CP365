>Alan_Helfgott: IJ F6 JI. +27 27
>Sam: BELORST I2 BOLTERS +71 97
#note No idea why I didn't play LOBSTER I5 here. The rack must not have been in my cardbox back then, or maybe I erroneously thought this was more defensive.
>Alan_Helfgott: APZ 9C ZAP +33 60
>Sam: AEIITVW H1 VAW +36 133
>Alan_Helfgott: ?DEIRRS 10E StIRRED +64 124
#note SLuRRIED 4H is 19 more.
>Sam: AEHIIKT K5 KITHE. +28 161
#note KHADI K7 is better staticly, but this is much better considering what it does to the board.
>Alan_Helfgott: COT J1 COT +20 144
>Sam: ADEISUY 8K .EADY +39 200
#note Would have played CAYUSE 1J if I had known it. CAUSEY 1J, a word I also didn't know, is also better than HEADY.
>Alan_Helfgott: BCOV M5 VOC.B +18 162
>Sam: EINOSTU 6F .UT. +11 211
#note Not good. COUSIN 1J sims best, with COITUS 1J not far behind. I need to block off that TWS at O1.
>Alan_Helfgott: ?EOQU 1J .OQUEt +78 240
>Sam: AEINORS C9 .AIRE +28 239
#note All of a sudden, the dynamic of the game has changed, and I thought I should open it up. However, INRO 2L is just too many points for too good of a leave to pass up.
>Alan_Helfgott: EMRY 12A ME.RY +26 266
>Sam: AEINOSX N8 .IOXANES +90 329
>Alan_Helfgott: EGGT 15J TEGG. +9 275
>Sam: AAHNSUW A12 .AWN +27 356
#note Quackle's choice, HAEN B10, seems a bit risky with two As still unseen. I want to be shutting this board down. SHAWM A8, not far behind HAEN in the sim, seems like a good alternative. 
>Alan_Helfgott: ILN M12 LIN. +18 293
>Sam: AEHNPSU 14I HUP +18 374
#note This isn't great, but it almost locks this game up. Didn't know WASHUP 14A 55, and either didn't know or see RAPHES H10 42. 
>Alan_Helfgott: INOR 2L INRO +26 319
>Sam: AEILNNS 14C SNAIL +22 396
#note Just locking the game up. EDEMATA could actually fit for him at 13E.
>Alan_Helfgott: AADEFMO 15F FOE +25 344
#note MADE 13F is best, this being second-best.
>Sam: DEELNT B11 L.T +8 404
#note DELE J9 is slightly better. 
>Alan_Helfgott: AADM 13I AMA +22 366
#note MAD L11 is two points better.
