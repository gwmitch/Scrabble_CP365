>George: BRUX 8F BRUX +26 26
>Steve: CDEHNOV 7H NOH +19 19
#note Leave is everything to the duck early in the game. It likes VOX by an equity difference of eight, even though that play puts five fewer points on the scoreboard.
>George: INOV 9C VINO +15 41
>Steve: CDDEGKV D8 D.CKED +32 51
#note Leave of GV is eerily prescient of who's going to win this tournament.
>George: DNOS 9H NODS +20 61
>Steve: GILOUVY J4 VUG. +15 66
#note Not the time to concentrate on leave, although that wasn't the reason for this miss. COY's 34 too much to pass up.
>George: AENW E11 ANEW +31 92
>Steve: EEILOWY C12 YOWE +34 100
>George: ?CEIILS 4H Ci.ILISE +82 174
>Steve: EGIILMN -  +0 100
#note Lost challenge. Felt it was too many points and I thought it might only be -ize.
>George: ?ADIQSU O4 .QUID +45 219
#note George told me about this rack after the game. Although he missed a 101-pt. bingo, it's only a 20 pt. equity error.
