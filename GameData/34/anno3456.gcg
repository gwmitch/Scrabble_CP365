>Mike_Baker: AINU 8H UNAI +8 8
>Noah: DEHOPRV K7 H.VED +24 24
#note After an extensive 7000 iteration sim while I was practicing piano, this comes in very close with P(A)RVO, POH 9H, and EPHOD 7I, all of which I thought about. 
>Mike_Baker: ELTU L4 LUTE +13 21

>Mike_Baker: AAINOST 9B ATONIAS +61 122
#note Maybe SONATI(N)A instead.
>Noah: AEENORZ D8 Z.NAE +48 181
#note I thought quite a while about this play. Quackle says ZOEAE is better. Why is that? Maybe because of all of the vowels already open for bingos.
>Mike_Baker: KR 10J K.R. +20 142
>Noah: AEIILOR E4 EOLIA. +23 204
>Mike_Baker: ?EEEGLT B4 rELEG.TE +62 204
#note LEGaTEE looks best here. Probably just missed A(EOLIAN).
>Noah: AGILRUW D1 WAUR +26 230
>Mike_Baker: ACNOP A1 CAPON +34 238
>Noah: GHIILOO 14E IGLOO +19 249
#note I hated making this lay so much. Didn't see any other options. But obviously there's GHI E11.

>Mike_Baker: IRTW C12 WRIT +19 309
>Noah: DEFIMOT 1D .IFED +36 329
#note Was uncertain of WIFEDOM, which would have made things considerably easier.
>Mike_Baker: BE E11 BE +22 331
>Noah: DMMOQST 2C Q.T +14 343
#note Somehow, MM C2 is 12% better than this. Maybe because there are AIIU left in the pool?
>Mike_Baker: CDEITUV M2 VID +18 349
#note He didn't realize the A was in the bag. We could only spot VIED M1 for a better play, and that would have lost to my rack (DAMSO(N)-S(I)M). It also would fall to stuff like MAVIS. but we didn't spot the nice VIED J1., which plays the same tiles but is much more conservative and blocks out-in-twos using stuff like DAMSON and doesn't allow V plays. 
>Noah: ADMMOSS 1L MADS +38 381
#note A bunch of other plays are better. They all block LEUTIC, which I didn't know. Best is AMMOS F3.
