>Pete: EIILRUY 8H LIEU +8 8
#note P: Exchange IUY is best here.  
>Scott: AOORTTZ J6 ZO.A +33 33
#note S: Sims best, there's really nothing else here. Second-best is TOOT 9F, which at least briefly sets up ZA for a cheap cash. 
>Pete: EIILNRY 10J LINY +25 33
#note P: Chickened out on the alternate spelling.
>Scott: JNOPRTT I7 J.N +39 72
#note S: The rack is going nowhere, but it's too many points to pass on and it doesn't offer much to Pete. Sims best. I don't start hemorraging equity until midgame. 
>Pete: AADEHIR M9 H.DRIA +34 67
#note P: The seven didn't play, and I decided against the ADZ/ADZ options.  I played HYDRIA, hoping I'd get to use the e hook, and maybe Scott would blank on it.  Aggressive, probably too much so, but the last game hadn't wuite worn off.  HYDRAE wins sim.
>Scott: IOPRTTX L12 OPT +20 92
#note S: There's a sweet play available that scores 44; it's out of my league (I'm sure the internet know-it-alls found it in three seconds). OPT sims second-best, and at least takes most of the sting out of the HYDRIA-E hit (though had I risked it, at least the J and Z are already on the board). XI at N14 is too much of a giveaway for my taste. 
>Pete: ?ABCEPQ N13 CEP +27 94
#note P: Wow, I made a stupid error here.  CEP up on row scores me.  With the blank, I wanted to set up the extra hook, but it wasn't worth the points I gave away here.
>Scott: AIMRRTX N6 TRIM +15 107
#note S: The sim winner is MILIEUX at 8F, ha ha ha. Not far behind is TRAM in the spot I played, and I get that - if Pete doesn't have a logical play there, I have four shots at a cheap EX next turn. ZIRAM is also a hair in front of TRIM. 
>Pete: ?ABDDEQ 6H AD.ED +28 122
#note P: Duck agrees with passing up QAT.  ADZED and exchange DQ finish about the same.  

#note S: Nice board vision. It's easy to miss stuff like this; the diagonal of the J and Z give the false impression that the area is dead.  
>Scott: ADNORSX 15G ADORNS +31 138
#note S: Here's where it starts getting bloody - how can I not see AXONS for 46? AXON at 5E is also preferred, scoring 24 and drawing to DRS. My crummy play is next, basically tied with ANDROS same spot. 
>Pete: ?ABEFQS 5K FAB +29 151
#note P: I was torn between FAB and EF 5K.  EF wins sim slightly.  I chose against EF for two reasons. EF seemed way too fishy, and I didn't want Scott shutting the board down. and FAB, if I catch an I, sets up QADI, which allows me to finally get rid of the darn Q. 
>Scott: ?ELOOTX O4 OXO +13 151
#note S: A good player puts down EXTOL at 14E for 35 and moves on. I took a long turn and never saw it; I always want to think that word needs two Ls (obviously both are good) but come on, it's a 5-letter X, gotta be a layup. My blue-hair special does sim better than EXTOL at 5D, for whatever that means. Duck taxes me 7.5 valuation points. 
>Pete: ?EGIMQS L4 Q..I +28 179
#note P: I didn't consider adding the S ... duck says I should have.  For once, a plan actually works.
>Scott: ?ELRTUV 5B RiVULET +70 221
#note S: A little better is cULVERT at 14A. There's no way I'm playing either of the RIVULET options on row 14, especially the 14A variety. If you're bored, find the two non-bingos that score in the 50s. 
>Pete: ?EGGHMS 4G MEG +15 194
#note P: I was going to complain about by draw here, but it appears I actually missed two bingoes here (Missed bingo #5 for the tourney)... (I'll give them next turn), needless to say, I would never have found them, but they're cool bingoes, 27146 and 25325 in probability rank.  
>Scott: AAEGNSS 3H GAS +14 235
#note P: I missed MESH(U)GGe and MESH(U)GGa last turn.

#note S: We have a cat named Shuggie, for what it's worth. I missed two bingos on my turn here, one of which is unforgiveable for an Italian. I had absolutely no idea how I wanted to play this position from a non-bingo perspective, and even a day later I'm still not sure how I feel. I almost played SAVAGE, which is winning the runoff of the non-bonus plays. My winning percentage goes over 90 if I bingo here; instead it's in the 70s without the bingo. 
>Pete: ?EGHSTY N2 GEY +19 213
#note P: Missed bingo rack #6.  While I've never studied them, I might have been able to deduce the eight had I not had the blank.  GYVE is the best non-bingo.
>Scott: AAEENRS D4 A.E +12 247
#note S: Championship Player prefers a handful of other similar fishes that don't interfere with the floaters on Row 5. Everything suggested is keeping a four or five tile leave. Take your pick. 
>Pete: ?HIIOST 3C THIO +24 237
#note P: Missed bingo rack #7 for the tourney.  I saw its anagram and was mad it didn't fit.  I did not know they one that played.  The bingo is actually well behind in sim, with the aggressive HI 2I winning sim. May play also outperforms the bingo.

#note S: TI at 2I also grades well, but remember my GAS play basically telegraphed that I have the other S. I'd suggest running these sims with an inferred S. 
>Scott: AENRSUV M1 VAN +19 266
#note S: I didn't want to get so fishy that I flushed away the tempo. The sim points to VAUS at 2A for 27, but I'm not sure if I want to play it like that (admittedly, any bingo he played would allow comebacks and I'm still drawing to -ERN). VAU at 2A I considered but his recent short plays scared me off it. At least there's only one U in the bag, so my chances of the U/U combo are unlikely. 
>Pete: ?EIISUW 11M .UI +4 241
#note P: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH.  EIUW draw to ?IS.  I considered IWIS and WIS top left, but decided on the fish.  Despite the closeness of the game, I felt like the timing was in Scott's favor, and I'd need to bingo to win.  IWIS and the opening LWEI win sim.
>Scott: EERRSTU 7C TRUE +16 282
#note S: The game is really getting bogged down here, isn't it? I blame it on the Lakernick karma; she was sitting near us at this point, fresh off her 11-minute game and wanting to make sure she didn't have to play any more road matches. TRUE is a solid pick but RUE in the same spot is a little better, for obvious reasons. 
>Pete: ?AEISWW 2I WAW +22 263
#note P: WAW wins sim by a ton, actually wins at about 60 %.  Nothing else within 7%.  

#note S: I like this play a lot, you need to give yourself a chance (though again I'd be simming with an inferred S). It also might scare the opponent into cashing the S cheaply, which puts Pete into the catbird seat. If I have a ready bingo, well, what can you do? 
>Scott: EEENORS B4 E.E +5 287
#note P: A neat play here by Scott.  He knows he wins a bingo bingo exchange a ridiculously high % of the time. This play adds another dangerous and valuable line.

#note S: Champ Playa (with no inference given) likes ERNES on the top row, which I could see if that emptied the bag (giving Pete one and only one chance). With it leaving a tile, I think it gets me beat too often, in part because I pretty much know the S or blank or both are on the other side. As for the fishing options, ONE 14H and NEED H12 grade out slightly ahead of ERE, but I liked my play too. If a bingo goes down the A column I'll still have a clean play into the 14th row, or new floaters, or the top row. And if he takes the top row, a lot of stuff will click down the A column or across the 14th row. (I re-ran the CP query with ?S inferred and it tells me a host of plays that spend the S and muck the top row. Hmmm. Not how I would have played it, but no one considers me a Championship Playa.) 
>Pete: ?CEFINS 1C FIaNCES +94 357
#note P: I bingo and hope.  I almost played FIN, which wins sim. FaSCINE 14B is the best performing bingo.  I should have been more aware of the game situation.  Decided to just hope Scott bricked, with the unseen K it seemed possible 
>Scott: BENORST 14A SORBENT +74 361
#note P: . . . but he didn't. Good game.

#note S: I'm lucky it plays. I was luckier, period, in this game, can't feel I played that well. Good game, Pete. And goodnight from Table 9. 
>Scott:  (IKLO) +16 377
