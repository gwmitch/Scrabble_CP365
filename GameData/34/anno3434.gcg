#note Although I have reason to be nervous about this play after that fish.
>Steve_Krieger: INX 3G X. +34 102
#note Played NIX at H13 and picked it up to do this. I had flashbacks to Pianowski passing on XU yesterday to just play the X and bingoing next turn.
>Jason: CEIMOOT H13 MOO +21 169
#note Overvaluing my leave again. OMIT, same spot. (-5.3)

#note Looking at the board, Knappster figured this must've been mine.
>Jason: CEEHPST 1A TECH. +42 287
#note Missing PECH(S).
>Steve_Krieger: AADGINW O1 AW +20 224
#note (Steve's actual rack.)
>Jason: AEPRSSU I13 UPS +19 306
#note Nearly played SUP to be defensive, but passed, fortunately. Duck likes fishing with U(T) at 7M. (-4.1)
>Steve_Krieger: ADEGINR A1 .READING +83 307
#note Trying to beat me with a TANGREDI bingo... Here I thought when I pulled the blank that I'd run away with this game. Must've forgot I was playing my daddy. (Counted as 89 and only fixed in the recount. So I think I have six fewer points to play with.)
>Jason: ?AEHRSV 12I tHRAVES +81 387
#note Or sHAVERS. Happy to see all playable bingos.
>Steve_Krieger: ?ADELTU B8 oUTLEAD +70 377
#note Steve spent a while on this rack before playing the only bingo. After the game, he said "Ordinarily I wouldn't have looked that long for triple-triples. But I thought 'I'm playing Jason Idalski. If he's putting something in the triple line, there must be something!" I laughed at that. 
>Jason: EMNORTU O8 MUTE. +21 408
#note Weird results here. Way down the list staticly, but won sim. However, CP doesn't mention it. Any suggestions here? Make a two-tile play like MO at C13 or not?
>Steve_Krieger: EFIOORV A13 FIR +26 403
#note Q likes OF at B5 or (C)OOF at C1. He put down FOR first, which would've surrendered ORGAN at C11 for a bunch. Le sigh.
>Jason: AGNNOR C1 .ONGA +16 424
#note Ah, he's supposed to block (C)RANNOG. I don't think I'm supposed to know CRANNOG, though. More spread-hemorrhaging, to the tune of 32 points.
>Steve_Krieger: EOOV 13A ..VE +20 423
>Jason: NR N12 .RN +6 430
#note Whew! Now 2-6 vs. Krieger and the only 6-2 heading into a game vs. Dan Pratt.
>Jason:  (OO) +4 434
