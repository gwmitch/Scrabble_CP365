#note Nice job, Cheezy!  A great example of the difference between active and passive word knowledge.  I held this for a little while, but it looked familiar enough that I knew not to challenge it.  However, if I had been in Alyssa's shoes, I would have almost certainly played UPSWELL.
>Jiggy: CENPSST E7 C.NTS +14 14
#note I spent a long time on this move, only to come up with a suboptimal play.  I never saw CUSP, which is clearly the play.  I was too caught up on playing in column E, and at one point I laid down CEPES.  However, given the very little vowelage to play through, I didn't love burning my only vowel.  I also thought of PECTENS in either position, (I prefer E4) which had the advantage of scoring more and tearing the board more open, but I thought I was burning too many good bingo tiles when I was already down by 80.  I liked this move because it kept good synergy and some good scoring oomph even if I don't bingo, while it also created the front S hook to help me fit sevens on the board.  The A-S-CENTS volatility wasn't bad either.  Long story short: CUSP is probably better, but given the score I think this is a decent alternative.

#note Here I gave serious thought to kibitzer's preferred play of PHT, but I didn't like the way the board shape was heading.  A short play on column G or H in response could kill all my bingo lines.  This play scored a bit more while also opening up some new possibilities in the lower left corner, which increases the possibility of the front hook on CENTS and the S on the star of staying open.

#note Kibitzer and I agree.  I was not happy to burn the S, but I needed to score and to clear out the consonants.
>Cheezy: IX F4 .IX +28 161
>Jiggy: AFGNNOT B1 FON. +14 75
#note Aggressively hunting for the bingo and trying to create enough distraction to keep the center S open, which is the only place my bingo is likely to fit.
>Cheezy: DIQU H4 QUID. +25 186
#note Doh!  She blocked it just in time.
>Jiggy: ACGNOOT A1 ONO +28 103
#note I didn't see AFOOT, which is probably a little bit better than my play.
>Cheezy: EE D10 .EE +8 194
#note Alyssa wasn't happy to make this play, but it does take away S beginning bingos on row 11, and there aren't that many tiles that hook here.

>Cheezy: EIL I2 LEI +15 209
#note Not sure if she missed playing this at 3G or she thought this way would make it harder for me to bingo.

#note OKE is obviously better.  I just missed it.

>Jiggy: EEILOTV N8 VOLT..E +26 385
#note I didn't see EMOTIVE, which is a nice alternative, but this might be better on the basis of making bingos unlikely.  The 30ish she can score on row 8 is unlikely to be enough to catch her up.
>Cheezy: AEG 8L GA.E +30 374
>Jiggy: AEIRUVY K5 UVEA +23 408
#note Explanation of a strange looking play: At first I did not see her out and was looking for ways to use the V and Y separately over two turns.  Eventually, I did spot the out, but not until I was down to about a minute on the clock.  I couldn't readjust my thinking and come up with better candidate moves in the remaining time, so I took what I'd already calculated to be a sure win.  In retrospect, if I'm going to let her go out, obviously AVIARY is better.  Best is EYRIE N1 which sets up UVEA in addition to the out of ULVA that I already have.
