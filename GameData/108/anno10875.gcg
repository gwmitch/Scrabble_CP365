#note You know a phony is bad when it's not even proper english. This is even worse than the time someone played *CASTED on me and I didn't challenge. I held it, then thought I was being silly. Ugh. And there's an actual bingo here - REBIDD(E)N. I'm such a noob!
>Huguette_Settle: ILNO L2 LION +18 75
>Matthew_Larocque: BDDEINR 2G BRIND.ED +78 176
#note Luck as hell again. I just learned this word recently too, and Huguette knew it as well. She let out an "oops" as I started playing the word.
>Huguette_Settle: AIM 1H AMI +27 102
>Matthew_Larocque: AAIQRSY 7G QI +23 199
#note Play it on top obviously to avoid cheap counter plays.
>Huguette_Settle: PZ 10J Z.P +34 136
>Matthew_Larocque: AAORRSY 1M YAR +26 225
#note I saw ROSARY for 37, but decided to take the hit to keep my S. However I missed ARRAY for 35. YAR and ARRAY are pretty close in the sim. And even ARRAYS for 40, but I don't think that's worth it.
>Huguette_Settle: OO J10 .OO +14 150
>Matthew_Larocque: AACCORS 3C CACAO +25 250
#note CORSAC is a cool word for 32, but I think I'd rather keep the S still.
>Huguette_Settle: EW L10 .EW +19 169
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEHRSY J10 ...EY +25 275
#note I spent a bit of time here, super glad I found this gem.
>Huguette_Settle: EKU E3 .UKE +20 189
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEHNRS D6 HANDERS +79 354
#note Or HARDENS, not much difference right?
>Huguette_Settle: EJTT -  +0 189
#note Wow, she's really being too nice to me here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELNOSV 10B VO. +14 368
#note There really isn't much here. LANES seemed like a decent leave, and I don't like the sims choice of OVAL M12 for 19. She probably would have scored a lot more than the 19 on her next turn. Maybe OVE(N) for 21 instead, but I don't think I can lose either way.
>Huguette_Settle: EJTT 14F JETT. +31 220
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILNS B7 ALE.INES +72 440
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILNS --  -72 368
#note Pushing my luck with another phony. A lot of similar 6 letter words take an E on the end such as ALEXIN/E or EMETIN/E or good old ISATIN/E so I didn't think this was totally stupid. Oh, ALEVIN is a fish? Ok yeah this is totally stupid then.
>Huguette_Settle: IX 15G XI +42 262
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEILNS 12L .E +5 373
#note Master of subtlety.
>Huguette_Settle: ??AILUV N7 VALUIng +65 327
#note Even with that ugly VU there's a lot of bingos here -  even VIrtUAL or sUrVI(V)AL are trickier finds than they ought to be - after the game was over I couldn't see anything in that rack either.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNRS B8 RA.ELINS +72 445
>Huguette_Settle: LOP -  +0 327
#note Would I really played a third phoney bingo? Well, actually, I wouldn't put it past myself to do that. I still didn't expect her to challenge this.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABINOTT A4 BIOTA +36 481
#note Word to remember: BONITA, which can also be BONITO.
>Huguette_Settle: LOP O8 LOP +27 354
>Matthew_Larocque: EGMNSST 4D M.NGS +34 515
#note I was actually leaning towards this being phony too, but I got so greedy. Lucky me..... again....
>Huguette_Settle: DEFGRU C12 EF +23 377
>Matthew_Larocque: EST E10 SET +21 536
#note And she gives me a great outplay too!
>Matthew_Larocque:  (DGRU) +12 548
#note This is possibly the least deserving 500 game ever.
