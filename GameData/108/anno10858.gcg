#note Against the mighty Blocker, this might have been unwise. The other sim winning plays appear to be equally unwise. Perhaps 10E CUED is my best bet, with the aim of forking the board through the C on future turns (though I really am not sure what's best here).
>Brian: MY 7M Y.M +25 128
>Will: EEENPRZ 10F ZE. +33 88
#note I was pretty sure G8 PEE would get Blocked with a capital B enough to not be worth it.

>Will: ?DEENPR N3 PRE....D +17 105
#note This felt necessary at this point.
>Brian: HIK O1 KHI +34 190
>Will: ?AEJMNW 11C NEMA +23 128
#note Also counter-intuitive but I again felt it necessary.

#note I somehow missed JAWBONES, but this is pretty competitive with it. I did see AJOWANS and felt this had to be better.

#note Weird play here - maybe I need to leave the A open? Other plays like DIF close the ENEMA threat, which I felt I needed to keep alive, but I don't have an E right now, so maybe I'm better off getting in the way of good scoring plays he might have there. Then again, it seems like Brian's best equity plays are likely to be at 5I given the pool.

#note The quest for OSTINATI 15A begins! Look at those Os in the pool! 
>Brian: BENOOT B9 OBENTO +35 354
>Will: AAINSTT C4 .A. +4 288
#note Wow!!! OSTINATI still goes down, what luck! Brian did just play two of the O's, but 3/12 ain't bad, and now he is less likely to imagine that as a lane (I know that I sure as heck would have missed the possibility). I did NAG to indicate that I was fishing for something through the L (as opposed to FA 2B, for example), but not sure why I didn't grab a couple extra points with BA.
>Brian: INW H1 WIN. +25 379
>Will: AINRSTT 9B .R +3 291
#note One last try, though I think it's too late given the score.
