>Jeremy: ?BCDEOT 8D BOTChED +78 78
#note 0. It's the only bingo, and the right positioning.
>Dean: ?AFRSUW 7I WAUR +23 23
#note 21.1 - D6 SU(B)dWARF 80, J5 SUb(D)WARF 68, F5 WAF(T)UReS 67, I2 WAFtUR(E)S 66.
>Jeremy: BEEIKMS L2 BESMI.K +40 118
#note 46.3 - if BESMIRK is challenged.  6F KIBE
>Dean: ?AFGIRS 3F GIRAFf.S +76 99
#note 26.7 - 5E GASIFoR(M 102.  Another 40 equity loss for not challenging BESMIRK*.
>Jeremy: AAEERTU H1 AU.AE +18 136
#note 44.8 - 2B AUREATE.  Blech.  I thought just AURATE.  Need to study and review.
>Dean: AAINOOS 8L .OAN +24 123
#note 0.2 - 8L (K)AON.  Not significant.
>Jeremy: EEGNRTT 4G T.G +9 145
#note 0. best
>Dean: ACDLOOS 6I OD +22 145
#note 0. best. nice play.
>Jeremy: DEEINRT D3 INTER.ED +72 217
#note 0. best bingo.
>Dean: ACELORS 11C ESCOLAR +80 225
#note 0. best bingo.
>Jeremy: AGHLNRX C1 LAX +38 255
#note 0. best when specifying partial oppo rack of QW (overdraw information).
>Dean: AEFJNQW 10F JANE +58 283
#note 0. best. But that 32 point QAT might be a good idea too if I have knowledge of your Q.  Hard to sim that info, but I still like JANE better.  Too many points to give up.
>Jeremy: AGHLMNR 1A HA.L +24 279
#note 13.2 - although I nearly played it, I wasn't confident enough in 1A HALM to pull the trigger.
>Dean: EFOPQTW N7 Q.T +12 295
#note 11.8 - 12F TEW.
>Jeremy: EGHMNRT 12G THEM +29 308
#note 0.3 - 12F ETH keeping GMNR.  The bag is heavy with I's, that must be why it is suggesting keeping 4 consonants.
>Dean: EEFOPPW K11 FEW +28 323
#note 0. best. and 50% to win.  It's a close one.
>Jeremy: GIIINRZ F6 ZI. +32 340
#note 0. best. 13K (W)IZ is really close.  Not too amuzed with the IIIZ draw, at least I got the Z.
>Dean: EEOOPPY 13K .EEPY +26 349
#note 5.2 2K OBEY
>Jeremy: GIINORV O6 VI.O +20 360
#note 0. best.  I think Quackle might be overvaluing my leave on this board.  Really, I have an H to make -RING bingos, and C9 for a weak scoring lane after you take the O column points.
>Dean: ILOOPTU O11 PO.OU +33 382
#note 0. Great play. 46% to win.
>Jeremy: DEGINNR L10 RED. +39 399
#note 9.1 L13 D(E)NI.  Makes sense, that I is going to be hard to exploit especially with 3 I's unseen.  My play is 49% to win.  DENI was 58%.
>Dean: IINSTVY 5A NIT.Y +16 398
#note N12 S(P)Y is best at 22.22% to win.  I wonder what has to happen for IINTV to win?  I probably have to open the board.   Not an intuitive move and not necessarily right.  6B VI(E) is 16.67%.  C11 (E)NVY is 11.11%.  Basically you drew badly so you have low win percentages.  5A NIT(T)Y isn't on Quackle's list, and the bottom is 9C Y(E) at 0% to win, so I don't think NITTY can win the game.
>Jeremy: GILNNRU A5 .URLING +24 423
#note 3 - A3 RUNNING
>Dean: IIOSV -  +0 398
#note 27 - J6 (DAD)OS. Total of 132 equity loss plus whatever NITTY cost you in equity, I'm can't measure that.  116.3 equity loss on my side.  Tough game.
