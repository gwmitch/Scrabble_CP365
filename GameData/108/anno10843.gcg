#note Before you look at my play, what would you do here?
>Noah: DEIPRRT 10J DRIPT +25 166
#note I think I should've sacrificed three points and put this at 11E, because it defends far better than this. The T is going to be hard to take out in the long run, and the left side is still mostly intact after this. My question: is there too much hindsight bias in this? As for other plays, I think those are the main two options. While NIMBLER isn't a bad fish, that's not what's called for here.
>Conrad: GHINOSW E9 SHOWING +85 165
>Noah: AEEEMRR 15D A.REE +21 187
#note Probably EMERGE instead, but I could only think of REMERGE!!
>Conrad: ?ABDIUY 14H AUDIBlY +84 249
>Noah: EEFHMRR 13B REF.RM +28 215
#note Put this down without a doubt, hit my clock, and then realized this was almost certainly phony. Conrad didn't even hold. Odd circumstance indeed. That aside, I preferred this to FET or HM because it opens up more.
>Conrad: ANOT J3 NOTA +18 267
>Noah: AAEFHIS E5 FE. +34 249
#note 8A plays seem foolish.
>Conrad: EX 15N EX +32 299
>Noah: AAAHIOS 13M AAH +20 269
#note Harder to make this call than last time, but I still dislike 8A plays.
>Conrad: AOT 11L TAO +11 310
>Noah: AIJOOSS 12A JO +19 288
#note Poor miss of KOJI C7, which scores well and makes blocking tougher.
>Conrad: EL 4B LE. +6 316
>Noah: ACIOSSS 7K .OS +11 299
#note Just didn't know CASSIS, which fits nicely at 9B. Quackle also likes O(W), but I suspect this is because it keeps CAS(SI)S.
>Conrad: CPTU 2K C.TUP +18 334
>Noah: ACEISSU O1 S.ICA +36 335
>Conrad: AAGNOOV 8B GA. +10 344
#note Conrad's full rack. 
>Noah: EGLLSUW 12H WELLS +30 365
#note I saw GULLS + WE/SPICAE, but I was almost certain that the only hook on SPICA was an E. The irony is that, if I thought WELLS scored one less point, I would've tried GULLS!
