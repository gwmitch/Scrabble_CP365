#note Ok. Pretty weak start. Several options are close... 9E IOTA, F6 KOJI, 9G TOOK and 9E KOTO, but I only gave the first two serious consideration. I just hated the leaves too much. But TALOOKA leaves way too many points on the table, and it gives a lot back.

#note Alright, so I didn't know CONJUNTO, which is definitely the play. Also, I was pretty nervous about this play because I had no idea if it took an S (it does). It sounded like a musical direction, so I was leaning toward no. But I decided I would probably try it if I drew the S, and probably challenge if he did.
>Dave_Leifer: RRSUY 13C SURRY +44 166
>Dave_Leifer: RRSUY --  -44 122
#note So that makes things interesting. I was 90% sure SURRY* was phony. So I don't think I gained any info about whether CONTINUOS is good. But now Dave thinks CONTINUOS is phony, because he's quite sure of SURRY*. But I don't know that.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ADHIRRT 8A RA.H +33 195
#note I think normally this would be the play, but with knowledge of SRRUY, I should probably take 8K BERTH to block BERRY. Quackle's inferencing is probably not to be entirely trusted, because I suspect Dave isn't going to try CONTINUOS again. Therefore BERRY will likely be his play.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEGINRT N2 GRINDE. +26 221
#note Nah, Quackle. None of the fishes seem sane to be. Lets gum up this quadrant of the board and burn some tiles.
>Dave_Leifer: ?EINSUW 13D UNWISEr +73 225
#note Thus ends the CONTINUOS saga.
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EMTTUVY 14B VUM +20 241
#note Ugh. Struggled a lot with this vs. B6 YEA. I don't have an O, and Dave has a decent shot of having one. But most of the time, he doesn't hit me too hard with it. YEA is nice, but I can't limp into a close-board midgame with a leave like MTTVU. Plus I am at least saving YEA for next turn. Worst case scenario is Dave gets the B6 spot and I don't draw an O... which happens pretty often unfortunately. So, like, what's the play? Sim likes YEA by a point.

#note Bad. I spent most of my remaining time verifying my tracking and that he didn't have a bingo. So I got lazy and hemorrhaged spread on the endgame. I did this a lot this tournament and it ended up costing me a cash place.
