#note ... but I forgot about TEGG! Blugh!

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEILOTU 6E .U +4 120
#note Not great. There are lots of decent options if you spot (PRIVATES)T, which I didn't. Otherwise, everything seems meh. I spent 6-7 minutes on this before deciding to try to fish. All the best plays hook PRIVATES.
>Seth_Lipkin: CDR 2F CR.D +13 79
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: DEIJLOT 3H .OILED +24 144
#note Eh... or (D)OT or JOG or something. It seems Seth was going to try to block if I continued to fish.

#note Ehhhhh... well I didn't see L1 SUEDE. Other options are C11 SEED and SEE. I really don't know. It's all close. But I do like opening this line, obviously.
>Seth_Lipkin: AX J5 AX +54 314
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: EFOOSSU 12K FU.E +32 294
#note Huge fail for me FORGETTING THAT FUZEE IS A WORD. I thought I was holding two of the last remaining hooks for this, but several were unseen. In that case, maybe do OUZOS? I dunno, though. If he hooks FUZE, then I obviously need a bingo to win. If I play OUZOS, then I still most likely need a bingo to win. If I play FUZE and he doesn't hook it, I may not need a bingo. So I dunno if I like OUZOS. Maybe OUZO. All of this is moot because I forgot FUZEE, so this play seemed genius at the time.
>Seth_Lipkin: Q 8A Q. +33 347
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?OOOSSY O12 SOYS +42 336
#note Oh shit, I didn't even consider SOY. Damn, that's the kind of play I am trying to train my brain to see. It's not the right play, because of METAZOAN, but QI clearly signals that he didn't have the N. So maybe I chance SOY and try to win with a big non-bingo? Or too easy to block? Yeah, screw it. Don't get cute. SOYS.
>Seth_Lipkin: AHO 2L HAO +20 367
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?BCENOO 1N BO +16 352
#note Significant error here. I missed J8 JOB to score points and set up another bingo line. Sure, the board is volatile enough as it is, but more lines increases my chance. Plus 33 forces Seth to keep scoring.
