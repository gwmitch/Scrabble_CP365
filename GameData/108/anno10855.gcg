>Will: ELNOORT 9E TOOL +16 16
#note I saw but did not like RETINOL much, but I should have come up with LOO 9B for sure. Pretty bad mistake, since the board is going to be horrible after Adam's next play.
>Adam: AANRU 7B RUANA +21 105
>Will: EEINPRU E3 PREU...E +20 36
#note The game is getting out of hand already - time to get crazy.
>Adam: EEIINV B1 VEINIE. +24 129
>Will: DEIINNN 11A INNED +36 72
#note I thought hard about INDIE because the board is so much better afterwards, but NN is also bad.

#note Adam told me his rack but I've forgotten it. I do know he had the Q at this point and was gunning for an I or a U to address his Q (the blank wouldn't hurt either).
>Will: ?ILPSUX 3A P.X +24 300
#note Ugh...A3 to shed the I and score 5 more, while still preventing easy QI plays. Could (should) have been a really costly mistake.
>Adam: EOQRT 1A O.ERT +27 362
>Will: ?EEILSU 12F ELUSIvE +69 369
#note VEINULES is out because of the potential JUST comeback. ILEUSES allows SUQ for 32 sometimes, though I will still win after that as long as I don't pick the J. I basically have to not pick a power tile.
>Adam: IIJQRTY K8 QI. +12 374
>Will: U B11 .U +4 373
#note Pretty obvious how lucky I got in this one.
