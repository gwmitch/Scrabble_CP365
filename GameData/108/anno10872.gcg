#note DOLOR in the same spot is probably a little better.

#note This doesn't fare so hot in the sim, but there's just not a whole lot worth putting on the board here.

#note Rats, missed F9 BYTE. But this isn't a bad second choice.

#note Yes, it did.

>Stefan_Rau: DEGLNQS O7 GELD +31 368
#note This would seem to be the obvious move, but Quackle prefers tacking on the S for some reason. 
>Robin_Pollock_Daniel: BDEI O1 BIDE +32 326
>Stefan_Rau: IMNQSTU 5K QUI.S +36 404
#note I'm overcomplicating things here. Just go ahead and block the K column (and make row 14 harder to hit) with QU(I)N. I was thinking that QUIN doesn't prevent an -Ed bingo coming down column L, and that I may as well take the extra 10 points with this. I stupidly overlooked L8 SUQ, which kills both columns and scores a nifty 33.

>Stefan_Rau: AHMNTUY 14B YAH +34 438
#note As it turns out, picking any four of the last five in the bag (AUHRY) to my leave of MNT wins every time....although if I leave the A, the only winning move is L2 THRUM, which wins by just 1.
