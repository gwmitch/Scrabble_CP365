>Dave_Koenig: EILLNOT -L +0 0
#note Quackle's championship player ranks this play highest.  It has a good chance of hitting a 7 or 8 letter bingo on the next turn.
>Steve_Polatnick: CORWY 8H COWRY +34 34
>Dave_Koenig: EILNOTZ 7I ZO +47 47
#note ZYLONITE is a CSW only word that I did not know.  It has the hilarious definition, "a wrong spelling of XYLONITE."
>Steve_Polatnick: AAEER 6I AREAE +27 61
>Dave_Koenig: EILLNOT 5D LINTOL +25 72

>Steve_Polatnick: BELV O11 BEV.L +33 197
>Dave_Koenig: DEEEKLU L8 .UKED +26 223
#note I don't like EKE or EKED at 5K as much.  They give too much back on row 4, because of the AKA and OKA hooks.
>Steve_Polatnick: EHM 13G H.ME +28 225
>Dave_Koenig: ACEEELN 6B LEAN +20 243
#note Gutsy, but perhaps not the smartest thing to do with all three G's unseen.  I had a little bit of cushion here because Steve had to beat me two games in a row by a total of at least 135 to catch me.  But I don't like to play scared.  PENED 12H is a very nice play that I would have played if I saw it and was sure of it.
>Steve_Polatnick: AERTUU F8 AUTEUR +18 243
>Dave_Koenig: ACDEEJS A6 CEDE +28 271
#note Interesting choice.  Keeping the A with CEDE instead of the E with CADE leaves me with either JAK or JA N10 on the next turn, but I just spent the case E and there are still plenty of A's to draw.
>Steve_Polatnick: DIO 12J DI.O +13 256
>Dave_Koenig: AAAGIJS 14B JAGAS +39 310
#note Objectively, this looks better than JAGUARS 9C because the other one gives him a more likely bingo lane and doesn't close down the row 15 lane.  Guess which one actually gives him a bingo.
>Steve_Polatnick: AFINRST D8 RAFTIN.S +78 334
>Steve_Polatnick: GM (challenge) +5 339
#note +5 on the challenge
>Dave_Koenig: AGIIPTX C11 IXI. +37 347
>Steve_Polatnick: GM 11K M.G +23 362
#note Now I'm a heavy favorite in the endgame because I've got most of the scoring tiles.
>Dave_Koenig: ABGHIPT 5K PHT +31 378
#note I felt like this was a little better for timing than BHAT or PHAT, as a one tile play is unlikely to help him and otherwise he is likely to get left with an extra tile when I go out.  Also, heeping the extra vowel makes my rack more versatile.
>Steve_Polatnick: NO 15A NO +15 377
>Dave_Koenig: ABDGIIO M1 BIGO..D +26 404
#note I saw I was giving him a big comeback of VIRION but also that I had a guaranteed win, clinching the tournament.  Better to end the game quickly and simply than to mess around.  Also, he was very short of time, so playing quickly kept the pressure on him.
>Steve_Polatnick: INNORTV 2L V.NO +14 391
#note In his time pressure, Steve doesn't see the higher scoring play, but it's only bookkeeping.
>Dave_Koenig: AI 10L .AI +13 417
#note 15H TAI is two more points.
>Dave_Koenig:  (INRT) +8 425
