#note I was sorely tempted to play WO B10 setting up QAT, but is that something I should really do with a 40 point lead? There are plenty of OX front hooks still out there. Still, I guess I made much crazier plays than that in prior games, so I  shouldn't lose my nerve now. I was extremely unsure of what to make of FOXIlY. It seemed like John's chances of having the second blank after a play like that would be pretty good - so maybe that could be a reason to actually play WO. It's not that likely that he'll have a T bingo to hook WOS, and if he has to bingo elsewhere or fishes somewhere else, I'll get my easy QAT. A strange situation.

#note Not under any illusions that I am likely to win here, but I have to first address ZOIC/ZITI before I do anything with the J. It would be nice to draw into JOHN M1.
