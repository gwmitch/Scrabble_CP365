#note Sims best! Nice. Considered longer stuff like ATRIUM, but I like keeping AIRT.

#note After the super-obvious fish, this does a nice job of closing off bingo possibilities. Then again, GYVES in the same spot is probably even better -- one extra point, a little extra blockage, and DN is a nice leave. No reason to obsess over keeping the S, given the unfriendly board.

#note Quackle prefers QAT by a significant amount, like 5 points, which shocks me. This fish hits a TON of stuff. I guess ELRRS is a perfectly fine leave as long as one of my two draws is a vowel... but uh, what if it isn't?

#note Trying to get cute and set up the T. Quackle says just to play FORGET. Shrug.

#note This puts me up by 101 with a fantastic leave... I can't lose, right? Ehh, maybe. NAH F1 sims neck-and-neck with this, and it's certainly the safer option. Borderline call whether I need to play it safe here. Worth noting that spread matters a lot in a five-game tournament.

#note He still has line N either way, so I guess it ended up not mattering much. In any event, yikes, this game is suddenly close!
