>Stefan_Rau: DDEGRYZ H8 EDGY +18 18
#note Eh....not a great choice. I whiffed on GYRED but that would've worked out worse for me anyway, given what Rob has on his opening rack. 
>Rob_Robinsky: ELNOORV 10A OVERLON. +72 72
>Stefan_Rau: DEKRRTZ C9 Z.RKED +60 78
#note Yes, I put that crap on the board, and Rob accepted that crap. BAT Premier, folks! I can only assume that we were both confusing ZERK with YERK, which is, in fact, a verb. TROKED would appear to be the winner if we're sticking with playing words. 
>Rob_Robinsky: OX A8 OX. +30 102
>Stefan_Rau: CEEIMRT F6 METE.RIC +68 146
>Rob_Robinsky: EHI 12A HI.E +30 132
>Stefan_Rau: AEILNNS 6A LINES.AN +62 208
#note This is slightly better than its anagram MELANINS, the only other available bingo. 
>Rob_Robinsky: ?CDIILT 8H .LICITeD +83 215
>Stefan_Rau: EFSTTUY 5G TUFTY +26 234
#note I didn't consider A12 HYTE, which Quackle prefers by a scintilla. I much prefer TUFTY. 
>Rob_Robinsky: IQU J2 QUI. +33 248
>Stefan_Rau: AAEHOSS A12 .AHA +30 264
#note Best. 
>Rob_Robinsky: GIJOW C2 JOWI.G +38 286
>Stefan_Rau: AENOSSU M5 SOU.ANES +60 324
#note Yeah, would've been much better if I'd seen NAUSEOUS. This rack doesn't look like it would cry out "Play me through a U!"
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ABEEOS O4 AlBE.OES +61 347
#note The only bingo. Had I played NAUSEOUS, it would have forced him to find the trickier (T)EABOxES. 
>Stefan_Rau: AAFGIRT B14 AG +23 347
#note FAJITA wins the sim, this is second. I didn't like FAJITA because it seemed to offer back too many ways for him to kill me with easy points. Neither move puts me in a tremendous position to win. 
>Rob_Robinsky: DEMO D1 MODE +42 389
#note That's what I needed him not to have. This looked like a game-clincher of a move to me at the time. 
>Stefan_Rau: AAFIRTW 1D .AFTIR +33 380
#note This wins the sim, scoring well without giving much back. With a decent draw, I can maybe rack up some points with the W next turn. I'm still not feeling very optimistic, though. 
>Rob_Robinsky: INNP K1 PINN. +25 414
>Stefan_Rau: AELOPTW L11 WOP +25 405
#note I'm getting low on time here, but fortunately I've made a best-case-scenario draw and have a handful of easy-to-find wins to choose from. 4H PO(IN)T looks like it's worth a few more spread points. 
>Rob_Robinsky: ABRRUV K11 AB +25 439
>Stefan_Rau: AELT 1K .LATE +24 429
#note Since Rob's been forced to V-stick himself, I could actually pick up a couple extra points by slow-playing, starting with JOLE, but I was too low on time to consider the possibility.
