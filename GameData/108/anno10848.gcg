#note Panic play. I feel like Trey is likely to have a blank and is going to hit this E shortly, so I would like to maybe get one myself and play along 3 before he does? Also I kept UN for BUNCOMBE just in case, which is why I didn't do TUTELAR. Q likes the simple LAT 13G, which I certainly saw and considered, but I really thought playing only 2 tiles and leaving the E open would be bad for me.

#note Really bad miss of FAYED. The points and the tile would have been a huge boost.
>Trey: OW 9A .OW +12 328
>Will: ADEINRU C9 .IDER +18 353
#note More panic. I should have done ADIEU for sure. CP also likes WINED, which seems like it would be really similar to WIDER except that I keep UN for BUNCOMBE with this play. I guess if I draw the B then it means Trey is pretty much guaranteed to bingo, though.
