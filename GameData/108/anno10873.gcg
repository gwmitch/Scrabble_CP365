#note Don't be so quick to cash in the X! HAW at 9M is fantastic, offering an extremely high likelihood of a 50+ point X play next turn.

#note Ugh. Two sets of doubled letters + a blank = I'm going to miss the bingo. I guess if I'm going to miss one, this isn't a bad time to do it: the only ones available (NICETIES, REINCITE, and INDICTEE) are 59-point cheapies through the C that give back good-to-great hotspots. On the other hand, there aren't a lot of great fishes available; (CHILD)E and silly stuff like I(C)E and (T)I(D)E are better than my weak-ass choice.

#note How long have I been waiting for FARTLEK to show up on my rack, and now here it is as a non-go. Unsurprisingly, this is the only bingo. It sure does make the board interesting, doesn't it?
>Will_Anderson: DEGNPST 14B SPEND +54 237
#note Yep, kinda knew that would happen. 
>Stefan_Rau: EEIILLU N10 .UELLI +14 259
#note The best of a weak crop of choices. Since I can't do anything with the existing hotspots, might as well create more, right?

#note Egads. Lovely to see you, Second Blank, but we need to talk about this rough crowd you're hanging around with.

>Stefan_Rau: AEEINPS 6N PE +25 391
#note I spent a long time debating between this and 4J PEA, which sacrifices 4 points to ditch that A with two more lurking. They come out as the top two choices in the sim, close enough to be a coin-flip. All depends on what's going to emerge from the bag.

>Stefan_Rau: AAEGINS 3L GANE +25 416
#note Yeah, this is pretty bad. There's no point trying to block a bingo, since the only ones Will could possibly have (ROISTER and ROYSTER/STROYER) both now play in two places. And I also need to worry about the possibility of ROSY/RECS/ASHY if he doesn't bingo. GANE's a nice number of points, but not nice enough to beat that unless I can go out in one with AIS + the last two tiles. No, my best shot is to put all my eggs in the bingoing-out basket by dropping one of those A's somewhere. As it turns out, the last two tiles are IR, so that would've been a 50/50 shot.

#note Another fun game with Will. Oh, if only I'd played just a little bit better.
