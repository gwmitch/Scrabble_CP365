#note Sims best, but human inference knocks this down a few pegs. I like APE, because hindsight is a bitch.

#note Clueless as to what to do here. and a little vexed by Jeremy's play. The board is killable, and it's still so early. I need to turn the tide. Surprisingly, this play is the sim winner.

#note Calculated risk. I felt this was a better shot than trying to make something actually happen on this board. And hey, it's a good shot against a Collins player. Still think this was the right choice.

#note I considered LOUSY and LOURY, but it seemed to easy to kill the board after those. I wanted to at least keep that E open. MODUS may not be awesome, but it's hard to defend against.

#note Of course, it makes it easy to him to just outrun any bingo
