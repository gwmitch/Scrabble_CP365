#note Ah, the sim wants me to keep the optimal AENST. Unload EF somewhere. 13B seems silly, but that's what wins the sim. Maybe KEF? Ugh. I like FA, though.

#note This is really weak, and it should have cost me the game. Maybe then I'd learn to look more carefully! The threats are the 7-line to LOATH (I completely missed it) and TEAZ(L)E. If I can't do a good job of blocking them while still consistently outrunning Z plays elsewhere, I have to NOT EMPTY THE BAG. 9G MOW is perfect. It outruns everything. Man, it's so annoying making silly mistakes like this. I never, ever, ever see obvious hooks.
