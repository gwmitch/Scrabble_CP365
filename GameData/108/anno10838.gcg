#note WONK/KNOW sim better. Tsk. Figured it was worth the points. It's really close at any rate.

#note I knew there was a six-letter spelling of KHEDA, but wasn't sure of it (KHEDDAS and KHEDAHS were both playable here.) This barely outsims the bingos here, though. I was happy to forget about bingoing when I saw this play.
>Adam_Logan: AAOPSTT J5 APOSTAT. +68 151
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ??EFLST 5D FESTiv.L +86 179
#note Pretty weak. I didn't even look at row 15. SULFATED is the top-scorer. Adam instantly saw the best play here, though. FLYBLOWN. Neat-o.
>Adam_Logan: ACCINTU 14E CUN.ATIC +66 217
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AHIIOWX 4D OHIA +33 212
#note Two things went wrong: I talked myself out of WICH (seriously). And got blank-blindness with the IV, thinking there was no hot spot there. HOAX.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ENOPRTW L1 WORN +32 275
#note Not comfortable with this play with the Y's both out. But I didn't like the way this board was shaping up. Adam is close to killing the board, so I want to keep things dicey.

#note Sadly, I mistracked here. I thought the I was another E. With that pool, I saw only NAMETAG and TANNAGE as wins for Adam, so I blocked this lane. Knowing about the I, blocking here is of course obvious.
