>Ross: EHY H7 YEH +18 18
>Reid: AELNUUU G9 UNAU +11 11
#note UNAU (37.13%) is #3. Strangely, ULU (#1, 38.29%) did not leap to mind during this play. I tried to fight through the horrible opening rack, but I have to agree with Quackle that dumping UUU (#2, 37.85%) is a better choice. I should have exchanged here, its still early and the leave is great.UNAU is poorly positioned.
>Ross: EIOTV 12F O.TVIED +24 28
#note Obviously I don't have the full rack to judge, but this seems to be a horrible play. Perhaps it is a setup.
>Reid: DEILTUZ J8 UTIL.ZED +72 83
#note #1 play.
>Ross: AEJ 15H JA.E +36 64
>Reid: AMORSTW 8J .OTWAR +30 113
>Reid: AMORSTW --  -30 83
#note WORMS (74.62) and TROWS (72.24%) at L8 are 1, 3 respectively. MOWS (72.47%) is #2 at L9. I'm puzzled as to why I didn't even consider this play. Perhaps I was instinctively preserving my S, but 48 points is certainly worth using the S. My play and carelessness is a huge mistake here. I meant to play OUTWAR.
>Ross: AFINR 8J .NFAIR +39 103
#note I thought this play was apropos in lieu of my bungle.
>Reid: AMORSTW 13C WORM +22 105
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player, FROWST (54.55%) and FROWS (54.02%) at L8 are 1,2. WOST (49.86%) is #3 at L10. I seem to have grown blind to this L12 spot. I'm stunned by the oversight. WORM (46.94%) at G4 is #9. 
My play is #14 according to valuations from speedy player. My play here is horrible.
>Ross: GHT D12 G.TH +24 127
>Reid: ?ABFSTY 14I F.Y +19 124
#note FAY (57.548%) is #7. BYS (64.92%) at L10 is #1. FAS (60.33%), and FAST (60.24%) at L10 are 1-3. Quackle doesn't mind using the only vowel because of the points and the blank in the rack. I was trying to retain the A, but this sacrificed too many points. Most of the other top plays are utilizing the L12 hotspot I should have noticed. This is another missed opportunity.I agree with Quackle that BYS is the best play.
>Ross: LSU 15A LUS. +21 148
#note This seemed like a waste of an S to me, but perhaps he had 2.
>Reid: ?ABDPST M7 B.P +13 137
#note According to Quackle 5-min championship player BAD (65.98%), BADS (65.38%) and PAD (65.06%) are 1-3. BAPTISED at N4 is #4 (64.72%). The remaining top lays utilize L12 with OUTVIE/D/S. BAP is #15 according to speedy player. BAP also closes up a bingo lane. My play is horrible here. Missing the bingo is unacceptable. I am still blind to L12.
>Ross: EX 14A EX +38 186
>Reid: ?ADNSTV 15H ....D +16 153
#note VAST (50.4%), VAS (48.41%) and ANDS (46.26%) at L10 are 1-3. I like VAS. I'm still blind to L12. My fishing play is horrible given the scoring potential of the turn. Leaving the V in my rack is not helping. JADED is #11 according to speedy player.
>Ross: NOOS 11J .OONS +17 200
#note I think Ross is trying to block L12 and the bottom half of the O lane w/ this play. Otherwise, it's a rather silly play. Again, he may have another S. This play was scored incorrectly at 17 pts.
>Reid: ?ACNSTV 7E CAV. +16 169
#note CAVY (42.81%) is #5. COST (50.44%), COS (49.05%), NOS (46.56%), and OS (44.03%) at L10 are 1-4. I'm still not seeing this spot. My play is not horrible but its scores poorly given the opportunities.
>Ross: DIP F6 P.ID +20 220
#note POD at L10 scores more, but I think Ross is focused on shutting this board down with his lead.
>Reid: ?AINSTT O1 INSTATe. +74 243
>Reid: ?AINSTT --  -74 169
#note TOST (44.19%) and NOS (42.76%) at L10 are 1,2. NYSTATIN at K1 (42.69%) is #3 and TANISTRY at O2 (#5, 41.30%) were both missed at this time. I was desperate for a bingo and talked myself into playing the phoney even though I'm familiar with its 4 anagrams.
>Ross: AEIILST O3 LISTE.IA +59 279
>Reid: ?AINSTT K1 NySTATI. +64 233
#note NYSTATIN is #2 (9.34%). I completely missed TRANSITS at 5H (#1, 9.85%) and all the other 7 bingos than are playable in the 4 and 5 lane. TRANSITS does not give the easy triple, so it is certainly better. Another mistake here. I was proud of this play until now.
>Ross: AMO J2 MOA +24 303
#note Ross continues to shut the board down.
>Reid: AEEEEEI -EEEEI +0 233
#note My exchange of EEEEI is #2 (2.83%). Quackle wants to dump everything but the E (3.42%). I suppose this rack is fitting consider all the missed opportunities leading up to it.
>Ross: GOW I3 WOG +24 327
>Reid: AEGIORR C11 RA. +9 242
#note GROG (5.2%) at 12A is #1. ROC (4.8%) at E5 is #2 and AGOG (2.83%) at 12A is #3. I attempt to create a bingo hook with my play. GROG does the same thing, but it has a better leave. My play is #30 according to speedy player. This is another horrible play.
>Ross: KOR B10 KOR +23 350
#note Ross shuts down the bingo lane.
>Reid: EEGINOR E5 RO. +14 256
#note Quackle apparently thinks that Ross is going to open the board for me. According to 5-min championship player, ET (0.4%) at 6N, AE at 5K and NE at 1K and ES at 5N are all tied for best play. I played ROC to open another bingo lane. I'm just trying to reduce spread. ROC is #18 looking at all move valuations.
>Ross: ER F4 RE.... +11 361
#note Ros is still shutting it down, although I realize at this point that there is not enough room in the D lane for a bingo.
>Reid: CEEGINQ D4 QI +25 281
#note QI is #2. COATEE and GOATEE at 4H are 1 and 3. I'm okay with me play here. Even Quackle finally realizes this game is unwinnable.
>Ross: EIN 1K .INE +5 366
>Reid: ?BCEEGN N11 .CENE +14 295
#note CONGE at C5 is #1. BOS and BODE at L10 to utilized the L12 hotspot are 2, 3. I saw this spot when OUTVIE was first played and then promptly forgot about it. My play is #12 based on valuations of all moves.
>Ross: AEEL N3 ALEE +16 382
#note ALEE is recorded as the final play. My score is correct at this point. I did not have the D in my rack, so apparently the D is missing. Ross's score should be 382 after his move and not 399. I'll have to be more careful playing him in the future.
>Reid: ?BG -  +0 295
#note Two missed bingos this game, two lost challenges. Horrible oversights again and again. I failed to properly track as well. This game was lost early but was still winnable at turn 6. Overall I give myself an F for this game.
