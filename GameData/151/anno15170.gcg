>Cheryl: ABNOR H4 BARON +20 20
>Reid: AEEIIRS 6H .EI +5 5
#note REI is #5 (42.86%). AERIE (43.32% at 6F, RIA (43.17%) at 6H, AI (42.91%) at G8, and AI (42.87%) at I3 are #1-4. Apparently EEIRS is a better leave than ARISE.
>Cheryl: EMNOY K4 MONEY +24 44
#note I3 scores more.
>Reid: AEIORST 4H .IO.E +18 23
#note BIOME (40.29%) is #10. I had just balanced to no avail so I was not in the mood for another round. BIOME is the highest scoring of the top 15 plays but OI at L4 (44.07%) and L3 (43.02%) sim higher because of the strong leave. I like my play here even though I used my E. In hindsight, losing the E may not be worth the 4 extra point.
>Cheryl: EEKW G7 WEEK +27 71
>Reid: AAGRSTV F5 VAT +14 37
#note VAT (31.84%) is #5. AVGAS (32.85%) at 11C is #1. In hindsight, this certainly would have been a momentum shifter, but I didn't want to part with my S just yet. VEG (32.62%) scores more than my choice but has AA in leave. I like TAV (#3, 32.38%) at L7 and probably should have played that instead. GAVE (31.89%) at L1 is just silly at #4. 
>Cheryl: AEPV 3L PAVE +22 93
>Reid: ACDGIRS O1 CR.D +27 64
#note CRED (29.71%) is #7. GIED (33.09%), ICED (31.74%), ACED (31.59%), GAED (30.76%), DREG (30.74%), and AGED (30.73%) are #1-6. I picked the right place but my leave could be better. I like ACED in hindsight.Cheryl was lucky I couldn't utilized this opportunity for a bingo in that lane.
>Cheryl: HOW 2J WHO +22 115
>Reid: AAGHINS 1J AAH +33 97
#note AAH is #3 (39.87%) but GNASH (44.39%) and AAHING (40.27%) are 1,2 and they are huge misses.
>Cheryl: ?ADGILN L7 DeALING +73 188
#note Many different bingos here.
>Reid: GIINQRS K11 QI +46 143
#note #1 play here.
>Cheryl: ENZ I3 Z.N. +25 213
>Reid: GINRRST 5K .RT +13 156
#note #1 play.
>Cheryl: JMPSU 11C JUMPS +44 257
#note At this point I was getting sick of trying to balance and not getting a bingo. I had decided to play FLINGS at B11 in order to get some momentum and some tile turnover. Unfortunately, Cheryl may have had the same idea.
>Reid: FGILNRS D9 FL.NG +18 174
#note FLUNG (5.27%) is #8. FLUNG does not increase the total number of bingo lanes available so I didn't like it, but I was tired of waiting for the ING bingo to appear. INGULF(6.16%) at D8 is #1. ZINES (6.16) at I3 is #2. FURL (6.13%) and FUR (5.91%) are 3,4. FRUG (5.56%) at D9 is #5, ARF (5.47%) is #6, and RIF (5.38%) is #7. The bag is vowel heavy so INGULF is a great play. It creates turnover and 1 new net bingo lane. ZINES seems like a horrible play. FUR, FURL and FRUG have okay leaves but not much else to offer. ARF scores poorly and is badly positioned. RIF scores well but may create enough tile turnover to avoid a consonant heavy rack. It also doesn't create any new bingo lanes. I agree with Quackle here, INGULF is the best play.
>Cheryl: COR J8 ROC +16 273
#note If ROC was played to close up the board, it's a beautiful play. It scores well and plugs up two lanes while opening no new lanes.
>Reid: EEIIRSU F11 .IU +5 179
#note PIU (2.55%) is #7. LIEU (4.34%) is #1 at 10L but smacks of desperation. Moves 2-6 are all exchanges with ERS being the strongest leave. I considered REGUIS (2.5%) at 13B but Quackle doesn't want to part with the S either. This is just a shitty rack at a crucial moment in the game. My play is okay, but it does make it harder to hook DEALING.
>Cheryl: FGO J12 FOG +17 290
>Reid: EEIRSTY 15H TRY +29 208
#note YESTER at 15H is #1 (2.64%) but I didn't want to use my S. There are still 2 esses left so this was probably too cautious. The leave is weak but probably worth the turnover and points.I prefer YESTER (2.47%) at 15J for its better positioning. TREY (2.62%) is #2 at 15G and also scores well and retains the S and a great leave. YETIS (2.61%) is #3 at 15F and the ER leave reduces the chances of II in the next rake. I really didn't want to play my R. I had the right place and idea but TRY is #27 according to valuations from speedy player. TRY leaves my rack a little too vowel heavy. TREY is the best play in my mind. I really messed up here.
>Cheryl: ?AEINRS C3 ANEStRI +70 360
#note Loads of bingos to choose from.
>Reid: DEEISTU D2 TIED +19 227
#note GUDE (0.47%) at 13L, DUE (0.33%) at D1, and DUNE at 4A are #1 and #2 (tied). Quackle really wants to retain the great SITE leave and dump the U.TIED is #28 based on leave valuations from speedy player. Quackle is still trying to win this game with some otherwordly hail mary simulation. I just want to get a bingo and reduce the spread. TIED opens up the 1 lane for a bingo and the N lane is still available for a hook with my S as well. I disagree with Quackle on this play. I didn't like keeping the U, but I wanted to create another lane. While Quackle choices also create lanes, they are easily shut down and easily exploited for triples.
>Cheryl: AIO C11 .IAO +30 390
#note this is a nice play.
>Reid: DELSTUX 14G XU +11 238
#note TUNED (1.4%) at 4A, LUXE (1.13%) at 10L and GLUT (0.33%) at 13L are 1-3 accord to 5-min championship player.  Quackle is still trying to win. I just want to reduce spread. I considered LUX (#5) at 10L but with so many E out I didn't want to give my opponent another big scoring opportunity with such low point tiles. Other choices from Quackle close down lanes that are already open. My play is #7 according to speedy player. I like the leave here, even though I'm wasting the X. I disagree with Quackle on this play.
>Cheryl: B 5B B.. +6 396
#note Cheryl is creating a hook here and obviously has the last A. There is not much point in blocking her play because I want my bingo. This is risky because the remaining tiles are so bingo prone.
>Reid: DEEELST N5 STEELED +66 304
#note #1 play obviously.
>Cheryl: AEILOST A4 TAILS +25 421
#note Cheryl misses the easy ISOLATE that her hook had allowed.
>Reid: U -  +0 304
#note Of course the tile gods decide I should be punished further with the unplayable U. This game is ridiculous.
>Cheryl: EO 12J ...E +7 428
>Reid: U -  +0 304
>Cheryl: O 10D .O +6 434
>Cheryl:  (U) +2 436
#note 6 of my playable 13 plays are in the top 5. 9 are in the top 10. I missed no bingos this game. I think I played this game pretty well considering the tiles and order they came. TRY was the only poor choice. I disagree with Quackle on my most of my final moves. Overall my play this game is a B+/A-.
