#note Best.  F6 IODOUS is a surprise sim runner up but that's misleading - it wins 3% less often and sims 6 points down.

#note I absolutely hated this play.  I considered plays like 14B COS but felt that, with two S's in my rack, I was 100% guaranteed to have an S while she, at best, might have had a 15 - 20% chance of having one. Thus, went my reasoning, if I took this away, I would hopefully have an "exclusive" hook on row 15 since I've now taken her easiest scoring line away.  Q says I should just fish to NOISE with 14B COS and that, if I want to play defense, IRONES 11A is the play.  COS wins 43.6%, and this wins 39 and sacrifices almost 9 points.  Yuck.

#note Right idea, wrong execution.  ORA scores 5 more and leaves a better ANRS.  The O is a little too negative to keep.  
>Lisa_Odom: ?EGHPRS I2 GoPHERS +70 152
#note Only bingo for Lisa.  She's 85% to win and her next rack will only add to that.
>Jim_Burlant: ACNOPRS 5H C.OP +22 90
#note Apparently the best play is 4A CROP.  I saw that I was creating a potential X spot but was just worried about my leave.  This was risky...and I certainly wish I'd looked harder for CROP given her next rack:
>Lisa_Odom: ?HIIOST K2 HOS.ITIa +62 214
#note L3 HISTOID scores 82.  Nonetheless, I'm in big trouble - she's winning in excess of 97%.

#note Frustration had set in and I almost missed this, but I'm glad I calmed myself down and found it.  Clearly best.
>Lisa_Odom: Q 12A Q. +21 263
>Jim_Burlant: AEFNRSV L8 FAVES +40 201
#note Wow.  Q says I should keep the S and play FAVOR for 24.  Counterintuitive to do it, but I think Q is right - what do I have to lose at this piont?

#note N10 JAMMER scores 66 but apparently the simple H1 JAM wins most often.  In reality, everything wins 1% or less.

#note Bleah - a B- on my end at Best.  probably more like a C+ game.  For whatever reason, I just couldn't figure most of this out.  Not that it would have mattered much after she hit 3 bingos in the span of 5 turns.
