>Jeremy_H: BHLMPSU K2 HUMBL. +26 96
#note L7 (R)HUMBS sims best.  I don't think I've ever seen that word on a board
>Deen_H: NNOO 6B ON.ON +24 120
>Jeremy_H: CCEMPSX 8K SEX +37 133
#note the leave is a bit clunky, but 2J C(H)- words will score nicely if I can draw a vowel.
>Deen_H: ENOT L1 NOTE +25 145
>Jeremy_H: CCEMNNP 2J C..MP +40 173
#note That O of NOTE helped me out a bit.
>Deen_H: EE M1 E.E +18 163
>Jeremy_H: CEFINNO 9F FEN +20 193
#note I wrote RECONFINE on my sheet, and put an X by it.  Didn't like it.  But it is good, and it is the only bingo.  B2 CONJOIN is 2nd best.
>Deen_H: OQU N4 QUO. +16 179
>Jeremy_H: CIINOTY O3 YIN +21 214
#note M7 (EX)CITON sims best.  I Totally overlook the GLITZY hook.  I can hit EXOTICA with an A draw with my play, and it also could hit a bingo.  I want to keep the T to make PENT for my bingo line.
>Deen_H: AFO 10D OAF +31 210
>Jeremy_H: CEIIOOT 11C OI +4 218
#note Blech.  Drew OIE.  Quackle say 6I OI(L) for a few extra points.  I liked OI because it deadens the board a bit, hoping it keeps Deen's next score down.  One of my rules of thumb, having a slightly vowel heavy leave  works okay with a C on board.
>Deen_H: EGIRTVV 6K .EV. +23 233
#note this play made me cry inside...
>Jeremy_H: ?CEIOTU I5 CU. +5 223
#note I had M7 (EX)ECUTIOn lined up.  and VEX killed it.  Quackle likes 9M TUI here.  I think Deen is waiting to pounce on a bingo lane by now, let's keep it tight and ditch the U.
>Deen_H: DHOY 11F YODH +24 257
>Jeremy_H: ?BEIOTT H11 .EBIT +27 250
#note I give that DEBIT play some serious though.  What if Deen bingos through the I and kills the board so I can't counter bingo?  I try to think optimistically instead.  Quackle likes 9M TI here.
>Deen_H: ?DEINTW 14G W.NDIEsT +80 337
#note ouch. That's going to make it hard to come back.
>Jeremy_H: ?AORRST 10I ORAToRS +65 315
#note I missed the R(ONION) hook.  A6 ROASTeR would be 12 more points.
>Deen_H: AAGL A6 GALA +22 359
>Jeremy_H: AADGIKR B11 KADI +25 340
#note Quackle says O8 KI(S) is the only play with a chance to win.  5.56%
