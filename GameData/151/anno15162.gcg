#note I debated between this and exchanging 2 I's.  After I evaluated the two choices - how many points does he come back for vs. what I give up by playing for 0, etc..., my own balance tipped ever so slightly towards playing through.  Quackle agrees with me.  But, when you see how this panned out...well...you'll realize that there are times you're the hammer...and other times you're the nail.   And this was one of those times where I was going to be the nail.

#note Yikes!
>Jim_Burlant: DEEFGIO D11 FOGIE +29 42
#note Best.  8A FEIGN scores 4 more, but (a) this balances the rack better and (b) given that I'm already two bingos down, I need the volatility this choice creates.   Regardless, 10% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: DDEITUW 15A WID. +24 66
#note 2 choices stand out here:  this or 8A WIDEN.  The sim says it's stylistic preference between the two choices; if I'm going to be saddled with the U, I'd like to keep the E for a leave of DETU.  The plays sim interchangeably.

#note Yes, row 1 concerned me...but the row 1 q plays barely score 39 to this play's 53 - just too many points to give up.  Besides - he's drawing a random 7.  Maybe he just defends row 1 for cheap with a bunch of one-pointers which will allow me to claw my way back in?  
>Paul_Holser: ?AEEMPT 1E tEMP.ATE +83 283
#note Well, he certainly defended row 1, didn't he?  This is his best bingo - no 3x3s available for Paul.
>Jim_Burlant: EEORTUV 5H T.OUVERE +72 191
#note Only bingo.  Ostensibly 2-1/2% to win.
>Paul_Holser: UX 2F XU +54 337
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: IJLNSTU M2 JUT. +22 213
#note Spent a while here and gave up when I couldn't find the O column play.  My gut told me I missed something, and Quackle confirms my hunches:   JESUIT O4 scores 63.   If you miss JESUIT, this is as good as anything else.  Anyway, missing this hurts a lot more because of his next rack.  Then again, JESUIT is still barely 3% to win if Championship Player is to be believed; this wins 0.68.
>Paul_Holser: FHTY O4 H.FTY +54 391
>Jim_Burlant: DEILNOS K5 .NSOILED +68 281
#note At least I got this one right.  And an aside - even with the misfire on my previous turn, I'm still averaging 40 points per turn.  It's not exactly I've I've drawn badly by any stretch. Nonetheless, 0.3% to win.
>Paul_Holser: AALM J9 LAMA +21 412
>Jim_Burlant: CEOORST N1 COT +30 311
#note No bingos play.  Too bad I drew the E instead of an I; OCTROIS wouild have made this an interesting game.
>Paul_Holser: AELPS L8 PEALS +46 458
#note Yikes!
>Jim_Burlant: DEEORRS 8A REDO. +21 332
#note Opening lines so I hopefully can hit a spread saving bingo - with two lines open he can't shut the whole board down in one turn.
>Paul_Holser: ENWY B6 WE.NY +27 485
>Jim_Burlant: EEORSTU A7 O.E +7 339
#note Damn, REROUTES was blocked.  Quackle wants me to play C8 DUO for 13.  Makes sense.  Whatever, this one was a moot point after I missed JESUIT.  
>Paul_Holser: CK 10J ...CK +21 506
#note Blocking my BURSTER out bingo.

#note The big question - given that, in the game, I drew DEO when I played JUTE, what would the other two tiles have been to my remaining DELNO?  And what would his comeback be?  I replayed the game in Quackle.  Best-casing it for myself, even if I find JESUIT and draw a bingo out of the bag and Paul only comes back for 25 or thereabouts instead of the 54 I let him have, I'm still barely winning less than 15%.  And that's the best case.  While I don't think I was giong to win this one no matter what, missing JESUIT undoubtedly reduced whatever feeble winning chances I had to zero.  That said, the rest of this game was spot-on on my end.  Props to Paul.
