#note can't play QIS and lose. many-ply gives 12A QI the best win% followed by 10C QUA. i wish i could explain why i suck. QI doesn't block the bingo lane through the R and scores more. i don't understand what my thought process was; i just kept looking until i saw a bingo (SPIEGEL) and played this instead. it's too easy to block that lane though.
