#note I got obsessed with this notion of blocking ZA plays since I ouldn't hit the spot myself. Probabl just beter to let him ae it and play BIG 3L. 
>Howard_Pistol: AINY 9G AYIN +34 123
#note I totally forgot this took a Y when I played it. 
>Matt_Canik: ABEEPST 3L BAP +24 117
#note I like setting up my S. He can only counter above this if he has O?O or O?U, which seems quite unlikely. 
>Howard_Pistol: BGOO 2K GOBO +33 156
#note lol
>Matt_Canik: AEEOQST J3 Q. +11 128
#note I'm so fucking stupid sometimes. ADRIFT/QAT
>Howard_Pistol: ILMY 6B MIL.Y +28 184
>Matt_Canik: AEEOSST D6 .O.E +9 137
#note Holding two of the last three esses makes me aggressively swing for bingos along O. AE/ADRIFT looks nicer. 
>Howard_Pistol: ENORW C9 REWON +22 206
>Matt_Canik: AEESSTV 12B V.E +12 149
#note I considered STAVES/BAPS, but I decided to be aggressibe again. 
>Howard_Pistol: EUUU -EUUU +0 206
>Matt_Canik: AEGNSST O1 ASSENT +37 186
#note And finally I just decide "fuck it, I'm scoring." This was a weird wonky sequence of turns that all started because of my shitty Q play and then my reluctance to undouble my esses. 
>Howard_Pistol: AEW B10 WA.E +38 244
>Matt_Canik: GIJLPRS C4 GR.P +18 204
#note Setting up JIGS, I might be back in this game withough bingoing.

#note UNICOLOR was a whiff. I saw 5 As in the bag and I had IOR, so I decided to fish for RIOJA, which would make this game really close, and with a blank I think it'd put me at an advantage. ASSENTOR was another option, but I didn't see that going many places.

#note He told me this was his rack. If that's the case, he's 16% to win right here...
>Matt_Canik: AACMRTT 1H MACAR +40 356
#note ...But I left the blank in the bag. 

I didn't think this was good and he didn't either, but he couldn't challenge it. It gave me chances to win on a recount.
