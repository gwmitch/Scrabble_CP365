#note I spent a really long time thinking about which bingo to play. ANNELID gives a LOT back down H12, LINDANE I1 also gives a goodscore back, and NONIDAL doesn't give much back but scores 9 less then he best option. 

I made an uncharacteristic play and sacrificed the points. Q likes ANNELID by ~2.8, then NONIDEAL, then LINDANE.

#note I don't even know how I missed VIDETTES. 
>Peter_Armstrong: AGINOOU 9F OU.O +15 85
#note Thi quick shift from consonants to vowels implied to me that he was keeping quite well after this play, and my gut was right- he said he held AGIN. 
>Matt_Canik: DEIKOTU 5D KUDO +20 139
#note Especially since I think he's keeping well, I can't play KITED 10B.

#note Do I play BIOcLEAN to avoid 3x3 possibilities?
>Peter_Armstrong: BIOOST 1G OBOIST +39 242
#note Held THURLED for a while, but with my rack there wasn't a good reason to challenge.

#note Now I only lose to 3x3s. He held this for 8 minutes while looking for 3x3 possibilities in his rack, but alas there were none.
