#note #3 (68.62%) according to Quackle 5-min championship player. OVERSURE (69.57%) and RESOURCE (68.84%) are #1 and #2.

Opponent held on the play.
>Wallace: EEPW I3 WEEP +29 41
>Reid: EILOOUV J6 OVULE +19 93
#note OVULE is #4 (62.07%). I considered OVOLI (#2, 62.19%) but wasn't sure it was valid. OVOLI at 7B is #3 (63.13%) and OEUVRE (#1, 63.66%) at 4D strikes a balance between scoring and leave.
>Wallace: AGM 9E GAM +21 62
>Reid: ADIOOTY 10E OY +33 126
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-minute championship player.
>Wallace: BFO 11C FOB +28 90
>Reid: ADHIORT 12D HOARD +39 165
#note #1 play according to Quackle 5-minute championship player.
>Wallace: EJT G3 JET +44 134
>Reid: DIMOPTU H12 .UMP +27 192
#note #3 (71.63%) according to Quackle 5-minute championship player. PODIUM (73.27%) at H10 is #2 and PODIUM at K8 (74.70%) is #1.
>Wallace: IQ 10B QI +36 170
>Reid: CDHIOTY 1E HYD.OTIC +70 262
#note I missed THEODICY at 10H. HYDROTIC is not valid.  
>Wallace: AE 2E AE +16 186
>Reid: ?ABINOO L1 .OBIA +18 280
#note I saw BONIATO, but did not see the hook. COBIA is #5 (97.74%) according to Quackle 5-minute championship player. ABO (97.92%), BIO (97.81%), and BOO (97.75%) are #2, #3, #4 respectively. BOO at 7D is tied for #3.
>Wallace: ADEEILN K9 ALIENED +70 256
>Reid: ?NNNORT 5K N.N +6 286
#note NAN is #4 (81.12%). Surprisingly, NOR at J12 is #3 (81.51%) even with double N in the leave. TENON (83.55%) or TENOR (82.90%) at 14J are #1 and #2 respectively. I'm guessing they are ranked higher mainly due to the increased scoring. NAN creates an additional bingo hook. I had not noticed the D2 bingo lane  at this time.
>Wallace: IV 14F VI. +16 272
>Reid: ?NORSTW 15K .ROWN +30 316
#note DROWN is #2 (90.78%). I had strongly considered OW at J13, but NOW at J12 is #1 (91.02%).
>Wallace: INZ 12J Z.IN +26 298
>Reid: ?AGIKST N6 TAKInGS +77 393
#note TAKINGS is #14 (95.81%). KITBAGS at N6 (98.741%) and N1 (98.67%) are #2 and #3. GOATSKIN(98.87%) is a great missed play at O8 for #1. I missed the NANA hook for TAKINGS (#4, 97.64%), which is a much better positioned bingo. TAKINGS (#12, 96.90%) at D2 is available but I didn't even noticed this spot until much later in the game.

This was a poor play.
>Wallace: IX M9 XI +35 333
#note Wallace said he was aware of O7 but wanted to keep both D and O bingo lanes open. Interesting strategic choice.
>Reid: ACGILST O7 GAS +43 436
#note GAS is #11 (92.83%). LITAS at O5 is #1 (98.83%). TICAL at D2 is #2 (95.58%). TIS(95%), TAS(94.58%), LAS (94.08%), LIS(93.92%) at O7 are #3,#4, #6, #7 respectively. LATI at O5 is #5(94.33%).  I don't agree with Quackle here. While LITAS scores a little better than GAS, it uses all my vowels and I didn't want to be stuck with no vowels at the end. I still hadn't noticed D2 and was strictly focused on the point grab at O8. Even if I had been aware of D2, I think going for the points there first is the best strategy.
>Wallace: R 7M R.. +5 338
>Reid: ACILLTT D2 TALC +15 451
#note I finally noticed D2 and realized the bingo prone remaining tiles posed a threat, so I had to block.
TALC is #5 based on valuations from Quackle 5-min championship player. TILT, TICAL, TALLIT, and TIL are 1-4 respectively. TICAL uses my remaining vowels and I wanted to avoid that. TALLIT leaves the unwieldy C in the rack. I like my play here.
>Wallace: AEENRST 3B NE.T +14 352
>Reid: DILTU B2 I.DULT +18 469
#note #1 play.
>Reid:  (AERS) +8 477
#note Opponent ran over time 1 minute so the official score is 342. I missed two bingos this game; I unintentiionally played a phoney; being unaware of D2 is unacceptable. 10 of my plays were in the top 5. Overall I give myself a C this game.
