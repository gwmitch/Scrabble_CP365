>Jeremy_H: ADEILOU 12B LOUI. +10 24
#note If this were Collins, DOULEIA# is a nice high prob bingo.
>Deen_H: AADEG 7I ADAGE +13 35
>Jeremy_H: ?AADEHM 13E D.AcHMAE +71 95
#note Got the worst bingo.  I wasn't sure on MEATHEAD or HEADMAN (which I thought was Collins only).  The best is 6H cHAMADE.  Also HEADLAMP and ASHAMED play.
>Deen_H: CEL 11E L.CE +20 55
>Jeremy_H: AJNRRST 8M TAJ +32 127
#note Hard to believe I didn't play RAJ with 2 R's.
>Deen_H: AILMOST 6G SOMITAL +80 135
#note scored as 82.
>Jeremy_H: BNRRRST 12L BRR +18 145
#note Saving the last R for the BRRR hook might have been a little risky.  I need to draw vowels, so maybe I should just play BRRR right away.

#note I wasn't sure on 14J UNDY. Played it safe.

>Deen_H: GLOW 5E GLOW +23 229
>Jeremy_H: AIIINST 4B INIA +11 213
#note D3 INIA / A(GLOW) was much better.  I'm trying to keep the board open for bingos now that I'm a bit down.
>Deen_H: OU 14A OU. +8 237
>Jeremy_H: EGINRST B2 ST.NGIER +76 289
#note So this sims best with somewhere around 75% to win.
>Deen_H: CE 8A C.E +15 252
>Jeremy_H: EOPRTUW A1 WOE +22 311
#note A many play sim here likes 3E WOP best at 73% to win.  If Deen is going to win, it will involve a bingo.  That play forces a row 2 bingo, giving back a TWS.  WOE is a bit back at 65% to win.
>Deen_H: ?AEINTZ 3E ZEATINs +80 332
#note Scored as 79. The two math errors negate each other.
>Jeremy_H: AEIPRTU 2F PA +22 333
#note Deen has an unblockable 4L SEXY that will win no matter what I do, but he is alread one minute overtime. If I push him to two minutes over 2H UTE can win.  So close.
>Deen_H: EHNSXY 4L SEXY +46 378
