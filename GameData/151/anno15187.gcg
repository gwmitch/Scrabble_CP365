#note I burned a ton of time on this move. I would rather keep my T for QUINT but the D column is the best scoring area on the board. MILT looks nice except that I'm keeping DER on a board that I have made much tougher to bingo on after MILT. I laid down ELM for a moment here before realizing that it was not nearly as good as FILET or MITRED. I think I made the right choice to sacrifice my T to deny Scott easy points down column D.

#note Too reckless? Not reckless enough (OVA/AVO instead)? I am ashamed to say that I was utterly blind to QUINTET until it was far too late.

#note Needing to make something happen and try for an S. 2J REGMA also opens up a bit and scores better, though.

#note Whooooops. Certainly cognizant of the bingos but I whiffed the hook. I am rated 2090.

#note I am still in trouble after 15D HASTENS (or O1 HANDSET) if I do TRAILED, but who knows what might've happened after that? Extremely disappointing.

#note Salt in the wound (though I had realized it before playing KIESTER).
>Will: BDEEOPW C3 B.OW +18 319
#note Would do BOWLED except that I felt like leaving everything open made things tougher on Scott. Realistically it would take a miracle here either way.
