#note the biggest mistake i made this game was to not think of retallying immediately.

#note i think quackle thinks this is wrong because AYE gives up too many points vs BONEY. OY kind of forks it though and he won't want to go right, but this lane isn't that hard to block. i still like it better than BONEY though. am i wrong? (-5)

#note i think N1 GHERAO is NEVER going to stay against Trip although i did see it. it's a nice possible setup for the J. i was actually too focused on keeping the J here to consider O10 JAEGER, but of course that has to be better. i wanted the J for scoring as trip is a very defensive player (had the lowest score-against avg of anyone in natls until the last couple rounds i think). also really worth considering is H1 RETALLYING as that may help him burn some equity to block. big error not playing JAEGER.

>cesar: EEJLLOW J2 JO. +26 333
#note didn't think of N11 ENOL. i'm not sure why it sims so much better except maybe because it gives me another chance to draw the R, S or the blank. (-5)

>cesar: ?AEELLW 13M WA. +24 357
#note how often does something like 14B WE work? i saw it but it gives up way too much. i was praying for the R for RETALLYING. maybe i have to hope he doesn't have the O.
>trip: P K13 ..P +14 389
>cesar: ?EEILLO K1 LOI. +16 373
#note no idea what to do here other than hope i get the R but that would still not be enough.

#note newel/jewel lose by 2. i was down to a few seconds and initially hoped to just take my chances with the recount but i think trip verifies scores and thought my only chance was at a challenge or something.
