#note Nice find. I held this for a long time.

#note He set down TRAINEES as a 2x2, then picked it up and played this.

#note I saw R(I)NDY right after I hit my clock and started kicking myself for plying too quickly. This does keep those Es open, though, and probably allows the best shot at being back in this game in the shorter and longer run. 
>Roland_Filio: AGHU B9 AH +31 264
#note He originally showed me GU on his rack this turn, then picked then up and played this.

#note VE(E)NA 12A is another option, he'll likely slot me some tile to work with at 15A but it probably won't be good. I wish I had opened this board up several turns ago, as I'm pretty much just going to lose this game now.

>Matt_Canik: BEEINNZ B13 BIZ +32 264
#note If I don't start opening and stuff, I can't win this game. B(A)IZE is 36 points, but doesn't do anything for the shape of the board. 
>Roland_Filio: AGIRU 15A I.AR +42 361
#note damnit
>Matt_Canik: CEEELNN J12 .EN +9 273
#note Stone-cold bluff. I've got nothing down there, but maybe he'll do something beneficial for me? 

DECKLE is cool.

#note Wahoo, now I'm going to lose by less!
>Roland_Filio: IR 8J IR. +3 376
>Matt_Canik: AENOSTW O1 TWAE +37 385
#note Roland said the ? was unseen to him when he played IR(E) and he wanted to stop me from hitting the TWS. 

I'm utterly shocked by the last 2 turns and the fact that I'm going to win this game.
