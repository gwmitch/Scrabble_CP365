>Jim_Burlant: CEENNRR 8F ERN +6 6
#note Result is a little surprising that the 8H placement wins the sim by nearly2  points over this, the runner up.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: AINSTTV -AINSTT +0 0
>Jim_Burlant: CEEJLNR F6 JE.R +27 33
#note Best.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?BERSTY I7 BETRaYS +70 70
#note Cesar's best bingo is I2 BETRaYS for 70. This choice sims nearly 5 points down. Play incorrectly scored as 66.
>Jim_Burlant: CEILNOO 13B COLONIE. +72 105
#note Be serious, Quackle - I'm not going to play COLONISE and give him all sorts of 45-point comeback  plays at J14, not to mention the easy S and D back hooks to COLONISE.  Can someone please explain why Quackle prefers COLONISE to this?
>Cesar_Jaramillo: NW 12H W.N +22 92
>Jim_Burlant: AEFHISS K10 FISH +30 135
#note Reasonable play, but Q recommends a really cool one:  10F SHARIF, which wins the sim.  This sims roughly 4 points down.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ADIW 12C WADI +30 122
>Jim_Burlant: AEILLSV 10B VIALS +32 167
#note Best.  Hated burning the S but this keeps the points flowing and tiles turning.  I'm winning 67%.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: OOP G4 POO +14 136
>Jim_Burlant: AEGGLNY H1 AGLEY +40 207
#note Best, winning 80%.  This is looking good and about to get better.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?EENOTT 1H .NTEdOTE +71 207
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?EENOTT --  -71 136
>Jim_Burlant: AGINRTV 2F VI. +15 222
#note Critical position.  I saw GRAVING and talked myself out of it, convinced it needed IN or EN on front of it to be valid.  The question:  if he tried ANTEDOTE* for only 71, had he even seen TONETTE or POTTEEN?  I gambled that he didn't, and that he would therefore drop off TOE or OE somewhere.  Assuming that, I felt that if I kept enough of my rack together, I would then bingo off of what he opened up.  Simming against his rack of EENOTT?, the sim indicates that I shouldn't try to block with GRAVING 2H; it prefers GRAVING 2B to open lines on the left side of the board so I can hopefully have other places to score after his bingo.  In retrospect GRAVING 2H looks right. Regardless of whether you agree with my choice, my analysis, or the sim, what follows has to be seen to be believed and typifies how much of the day had gone.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ?EENOTT J1 TONEtTE +64 200
#note I gambled and lost.  L4 is obviously the correct placement, and Cesar told me he placed it here because he didn't want to open too much up for me.   Hate to break it to you Cesar, but when you're trailing by this much not only can you turn down the 5 extra points, but you also need the more volatile board so you can get back into the game.   Play incorrectly scored as 62.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGNRT 1J .ARGET +24 246
#note Hmm.  H12 WEAR would have probably been better; it's Q's choice as it does do a much better job of keeping this rack together than this.  No reason to turn this many tiles with AEGNT in my rack.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ADEGLNT L5 TANGLED +69 269
#note This was becoming too much.  My tiles collapsed halfway into round 1, in round 3 the most improbable worst-case scenario panned out in my opponent's favor, in round 5 I lost a turn when I transposed letters, and in that game my 60+-point lead turned to dust as my opponent outdrew me in the late game.  My round 7  game disintegrated late.  So on top of all this, Cesar loses a turn with his phony, he makes the wrong play on his next turn, and is rewarded for it by drawing an easy bingo right out of the bag.  And adding insult to injury, his bingo plays only because he made the wrong play on the last turn.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEMNT H12 ..ET +21 267
#note And now I'm sitting on my second consecutive no-go, adding that much more to my frustration level.  8L GAME is much better from the perspective of my rack, but I didn't like the board with that.  I felt that I needed to open up row 15, as GAME would make it way too easy for him to defend the board.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: IX 2N XI +38 307
#note The hits just keep coming.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIMNO M3 MOA +12 279
>Cesar_Jaramillo: FO F12 ..FO +15 322
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMNSU 8L .UM +6 285
#note Despite the frustration, I haven't given up on this game yet.  I have the case S and the blanks are already played - why not make him defend? 
>Cesar_Jaramillo: DI 9N ID +7 329
#note As expected.
>Jim_Burlant: AAEINSZ N6 ZA..A +38 323
#note ZEINS or ZINES for 93 would have been nice, but oh well.  This is best.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: ADQU O4 QUAD +38 367
>Jim_Burlant: EHIINRS B13 .HI +16 339
#note I think I am beaten; therefore I am.  I have the tiles to win, but his play of QUAD was the straw that broke the camel's back.  At this point I had just given up on the game due to frustration, because the only thing I'm seeing is that I'm sitting on my 3rd nogo in my last 5 turns on top of what I described earlier.   And that's too bad - DISHIER O9 wins 70%, and given that CU were the last tiles in the bag, Cesar doesn't have a win if I find DISHIER.
>Cesar_Jaramillo: BEKOPRU 15H .URK +8 375
>Jim_Burlant: CEINRSU 15A R.CE +21 360
#note Annotation ends here, final score 369 - 403.  A completely deserved loss.
