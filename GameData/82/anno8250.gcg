#note He told me he had this rack after the game. I'd probably have changed 1 too.
>Toh_Weibin: DEEFGLM 8E FLEG +16 16
#note The problem being, of course, that changing 1 means he probably has a bingo! I played this for a few reasons - exposing DLS doesn't matter since he probably has 1-2 pointers, he is perhaps unlikely to bingo to the G (actually I should have rethought this, he probably has the E so maybe I should expose another one for him, since -ING is a good possibility), double-double through F in that position is not too likely either. I didn't think FLEDGE would be a good move since a leave of DEM would give me a semi-decent chance of a counter. Anyway, I overthought this move for sure.

>Toh_Weibin: ACDOPRW 9J WRAP +23 114
#note WAP is probably more equitable but I did not like the idea of keeping a tile that wasn't too useful on this board while opening an S hook.

>Toh_Weibin: CDEIOOU 14G DOUCE +22 136
#note Over-defensive again - COU(R)IE or COU(R)IED is better.

>Toh_Weibin: ?GIPRST 13B GRIP +20 269
#note Played this to avoid consonant heavy racks the next play - sims best, surprisingly.

>Toh_Weibin: ?AANSST 3D STANzAS +68 337
#note I'd mistracked at this point, so I thought he had an A (doubly likely with him opening GIN) - so I played STANzAS to restrict his counter possibilities. Okay, honestly I just didn't bother to find a better play :).
