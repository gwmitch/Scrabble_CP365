>Francis: AEFIKPR 8B NIFTERS +78 78
>Francis: AEFIKPR --  -78 0
#note If I had an S, it's a interesting decision to let the phoney go.  With my actual rack it was an easy decision.
>Matt_: AEEILOT -EIO +0 0
#note Against an inferred rack of EFINRST, this exchange is 2nd to 8G OE.  I'm gambling that he doesn't know SNIFTER and will play short instead, and I don't want to give him A's and E's for FERNIEST/INFESTER/FAINTERS.
>Francis: EFINRST 8H IF +10 10
#note The gamble pays off.
>Matt_: AEILLOT I8 .ELLATIO +63 63
#note It's fun to tell non-Scrabblers that you can play words like FELLATIO for big points.  
>Francis: EINNRST 15D TERNI.NS +77 87
#note Quackle prefers INTONERS...I think that's just asking for VARIX or UMIAQ to hit 14B.
>Matt_: ADEIMNY 13C DYNAMI.E +84 147
#note Went for points here, although I saw all the bingo options.  I should have gone with MAIDENLY simply for the ironic symmetry of my previous bingo, and his next play.
>Francis: EJOS K10 JOES +37 124
>Matt_: FHLRTTW 12H T.W.R +26 173
#note Happy to see this was best.  
>Francis: AEZ 10F ZEA. +33 157
>Matt_: FHHILOT D8 FILTH. +38 211
#note Guess keeping FHLT can be very potent.
>Francis: IPP C7 PIP +25 182
>Matt_: ACDHOUX B6 HOD +26 237
#note Didn't like XU for 29, giving up potential big plays down column A.  Missing on AX for 29 was bad tough, and a case for DOUX 7E 22 can be made as well.
>Francis: GTU A5 GUT +14 196
#note Too bad the F's and H's are gone to play FOREGUT/HINDGUT.
>Matt_: ACEGOUX 10A AXE. +35 272
#note JEUX to dump the U, but I liked keeping things closed down while having the lead.  
>Francis: VV A9 V.V +9 205
>Matt_: ACEGOQU 7F QUA +15 287
#note QUA(TERNIONS) 60! Sick!  Quackle suggests dumping GO or EGO somewhere, keeping the potent QUAC together.  I didn't see where the Q was going on this board, so decided to dump it ASAP.
>Francis: CD G6 C.D +13 218
#note He's gotta have an S here with this play, right?  Unfortunately for me it's a well crafted hook that I can't do much to shut down.
>Matt_: CEGINOO L8 GOO +15 302
#note L8 COOER keeping ING is neat, but that ING is not doing much on this board anyway without an S/blank.  
>Francis: IO E11 IO. +15 233
#note Another fish, I'm guessing.
>Matt_: CEEIMNW 8K N.WEE +27 329
#note Ruled out plays like MEW and WE M9 because of the dangerous Y hook.  With 4 E's still left unseen I think I can safely play off 2 here.
>Francis: AEINRST 5E NASTIER +85 318
#note And he finally hits big.
>Matt_: ABCDEIM 6J MEDIC +34 363
#note And I get the opportunity to play MEDIC in the exact same spot in consecutive games.  In this case, it restricts the bingo lanes a bit, and only the S hook is dangerous, as ending a 6 in an O isnt the easiest thing to do.  IMBED and AMBIC in row 4 open up easy lanes for 7's.
>Francis: AKO 4D OAK +22 340
#note I think he told me after the game that he drew both blanks at this turn, hence opening up the S hook.  
>Matt_: ABGLRSU 3A GRUB +18 381
#note 4I BRAG does a good job of shutting down the lane he just created; should have looked harder there.  I'm still hoping to draw a blank myself and possibly bingo out next turn, as the unseen tile pool looks pretty good.
>Francis: ??AENRR 2C NARRatE +64 404
#note We thought in the postmortem that his best shot was playing R(E) O7 for 2, blocking my BAYOUS O1 and he can bingo out next turn with AEENR??, but that still loses 420-417 after I play BUSY for 39.  Turns out he has several bingoes at 4I that do that job just fine (pREwARN and 6 more) , and he'll outrun BUSY 422-420.  It's really hard to anagram with two blanks under time pressure though.
>Matt_: ABLOSUY O1 BAYOUS +47 428
#note I was mixing up BOYLAS with BOLYAS*, in the hope to score 56 in this spot.  It took me about 10 minutes (most on his clock) to finally spot BAYOUS.  
>Francis: E -  +0 404
#note Lost desperation challenge.
>Matt_: L 2N L. +4 432
>Matt_:  (E) +2 434
