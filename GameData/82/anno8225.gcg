#note Five million hits on Google, but this word is #.  INCANTED was better anyway.

>Dave: BINORTW N2 BROW +27 294
#note Maybe BOW, but turning over the extra tile and starting to block bingo lines seemed like a good idea at the time.
>Rosin_Bag: GIOTZ A10 ZO.TIG +57 295
#note "You're up by one.  How did this happen?"
>Dave: CEEINOT C2 IN.ECT +32 326
#note Again, turning over the extra tile and grabbing a couple extra points seemed more valuable than balancing the rack better with EJECT here.
>Rosin_Bag: EMMY 12L EMMY +40 335
#note Right in time to block my HOARY play.
>Dave: AEHIORY 14J YEH +41 367
#note Maybe AHOY M3, but this isn't bad, especially considering how few vowels are left.
>Rosin_Bag: ?EKLNST I2 TiNKLES +75 410
#note And just like that, I'm dead in the water, unless he has left the X in the bag.  There are too many good places to score with it.
>Dave: AEIORRS 5E .ROA.ER +26 393
#note I couldn't see a reason to do anything other than go out quickly and grab as many points as I could here.  Quackle thinks KOR wins 2.78% of the time, but that's ridiculous.  Sam had plenty of time, and he was easily going to be able to block any bingos I could draw into while continuing to score.
>Rosin_Bag: DEGITUX H1 DEX +43 453
#note He held CROAKER for a while but unfortunately did not challenge.
>Dave: ILNS L2 NILS +22 415
>Dave:  (GITU) +10 425
#note Afterward I was amazed that I had opened with three bingos, never really slowed down, and still lost this game.
