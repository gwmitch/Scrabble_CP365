>sneakyofverb: CEIIORS 8H OI +4 4
#note Ducky likes this enough too, although exchanging one or two Is is also in the mix.
>sneakier_i: AEINQRU H4 AEQU.RIN +68 68
#note Maybe I should've exchanged.  Nah, he'd still have QUEAN and I could be SOL.
>sneakyofverb: CDEIRSU 12D CRUISED +91 95
#note Anything you can bingo, I can bingo better.
>sneakier_i: EEILPST E5 EPISTLE. +90 158
#note Grumble, grumble, whatever.
>sneakyofverb: AAHLNTT 8A LATH. +36 131
>sneakier_i: ?EEIRTU 13I REqUITE +70 228
#note Thought it was a bit risky at the time, but turns out this (or the others in this spot) is by far the highest scoring bingo.
>sneakyofverb: AANSTVW O12 W.AN +33 164
#note Maybe VAW 14h (35) is superior, but I gots to take out the O column.  You know, just in case he's got Irving in tow.
>sneakier_i: CDEFIO F2 COIFED +34 262
#note Ha ha.  He only used six tiles.
>sneakyofverb: AISSTVZ 14J VIS +32 196
#note Quackhead approves.  Praise the board.
>sneakier_i: DUW D3 WUD +21 283
>sneakyofverb: AAGNSTZ 15E STANZA +53 249
#note I spent a long time deciding what to play.  The sim gives a slight edge to ZAGS 15g (50), but I prefer scoring as much as possible.  And who knows, maybe I'll get lucky...
>sneakier_i: BEEP 14D BEEP +20 303
>sneakyofverb: ?EGLNOY B8 .mYLOGEN +88 337
#note ...like drawing the blank when it matters.  Just have to hope he doesn't have something like JANE/JADE a12.
>sneakier_i: HNO C2 HON +24 327
>sneakyofverb: DEGORRT B2 ERGOT +36 373
#note As much I didn't want to shed the second-last E, I have to take the points.
>sneakier_i: MY A1 MY +30 357
>sneakyofverb: ABDLORV A13 ABO +28 401
#note I was all set to lay down BORA in this spot.  In my mind.  Good thing I looked up and noticed it wouldn't play.  Thought using the A was only a minor risk, as the remaining vowel-consonant ratio is about 50:50.
>sneakier_i: AITX I3 TAXI +34 391
#note I was kinda glad to see the X now.  Not sure why.  (Wow, that was insightful commentary.)
>sneakyofverb: ADFLORV L11 VA.. +14 415
#note Probably spent way too long making a decision.  Really wanted FLOTA n10 (41) but I thought that could allow for a comeback play like JAKE o7 (50), which would kill my chances if I don't draw a vowel.  Quackle doesn't totally hate VAUS, slotting it only behind FLOTA and FAV(US) l10 (22).
>sneakier_i: JKN 10G J.NK +25 416
>sneakyofverb: DEFLOOR N10 FOO.LE +45 460
#note I was down to around 1:30 and had to think quickly.  I eventually saw FOOT and thankfully noticed the extension.  (Cute play: (DEF)L(EX)ED 5d for 40.  Yeah, that's totally within my study range.)
>sneakier_i: AGIMR 5H ..AM +26 442
>sneakyofverb: DR 3F .D +5 465
#note Stupid, stupid.  Although when you're under 30 seconds, brain matter doesn't matter.   And this isn't going to cost me the game.
>sneakier_i: GIR K2 GRI. +7 449
#note I told him after he was very nice to do this, although he could've tried to find more points with my orphan R.  The problem is if he plays it wrong or gets greedy, he also gets stuck with the R.
