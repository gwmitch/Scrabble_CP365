>Bill: ADEIMNS H4 MEDIANS +76 76
#note I don't have some racks because I was playing two games and didn't write them down.
>Dave: ?AGINPR 10H .PARkING +64 64
#note Dave came down with a case of Play the First Bingo You See Syndrome here.
>Bill: AEIRTTW O7 TWI. +24 100
#note Best, now that I don't have WARTIEST. Dave finding one of the double-doubles would've helped us both.
>Dave: ABCEEHL K3 BLEACHE. +80 144
#note BECHAMEL for four more. This certainly increases the white-knuckle factor.
>Bill: AAENRTT 5B ANTEAT.R +66 166
#note ATTAINER for four more. Normally I'd find that and miss the compound word.
>Dave: IQ N6 QI +33 177
>Bill: UX 6B XU +52 218
>Dave: ERT B2 RET.. +24 201
>Bill: EINORRY A1 YONI +31 249
#note I was deciding between the leaves for YORE and YONI. Quackle says YORE is better. I passed on YOD at 6F largely because I'd like to draw two more tiles for a better chance at the big S-hook.
>Dave: INS 11K SIN +41 242
>Bill: AEHRR 6F HA. +30 279
>Dave: Z 6J Z. +31 273
>Bill: ERRSVY M9 V..ERY +32 311
#note I know that I had the S here but not the blank, can't remember the last letter (probably one of the O's). This rates best given either ERRSVY or EORRSVY.
>Dave: EEJ C1 JEE +29 302
>Bill: ?BDOORS L1 BROODS +47 358
#note Quackle agrees with passing on BROODeRS for 64 (and cORDOBAS for 61, which I didn't see), as well as tacking on the S. An S doesn't do much on this board, anyway.
>Dave: DD 7G D.D +15 317
>Bill: ?CEKMOO 1L .OOK +30 388
#note COOMBE is probably best, preventing big J plays. BOCK is asking for vowel trouble (I wasn't tracking, but I knew there were a lot of vowels left). Quackle also likes JOCKOs for 57. I didn't consider using the blank for a J play, but if I had known how bad the pool was I might have. I wouldn't have been sure of JOCKOs, so I would've played JOCKEy if anything.
>Dave: AILOV 1C .OVIAL +51 368
#note Dave said he fished for this on the previous play, but I can't remember which letter (I think O).
>Bill: ?ACELMT 3I CA..T +24 412
#note I looked for a long time for a bingo that wasn't there. I have a bad habit in those situations of making a really inferior play after giving up the search, in this case an inferior and phony play. Maybe I subconsciously wanted it to get challenged off so I could keep looking for a bingo.
>Dave: IP 2N PI +22 390
>Bill: ?EEGLMO 4D EM +16 428
#note The sim suggestion is GENOME at 9F. I won't argue with a computer, but now that I've realized that there are three U's unseen, I'm committed to playing short (didn't see GENOME anyway).
>Dave: UUU -UUU +0 390
#note Dave exchanged seven, and he said it included all the U's.
>Bill: ?EFGLOT 14F FEToLOG. +74 502
>Dave: EEINRSW H12 WI.E +33 423
#note Dave said he had WEINERS, neither spelling of which plays. What does play is NEWSIER, for 90. I don't know if he knows the word; I do, but I didn't see it before entering the play.
>Bill: AFGLUUU 2F FA +28 530
#note If Dave had played NEWSIER, I probably would've played FAG or FUG at 13G for 29 (I don't think I would've found/been sure of FUGAL). If he finds the best spot for the remaining O, the final score would be 531-497.
>Dave: ENORS 13B SNORE +15 438
>Dave:  (GLUUU) +12 450
