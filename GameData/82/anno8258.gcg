#note Well, PREB(E)NdS for 64 is best.  B(A)P is 2nd.  I think this wins for style points.

#note I got rid of the T because there is a T open.  The philosophy of, "your rack is potentially what you, plus whatever is open on the board".  Every edge helps.

#note Very interesting position here!  I saw CHANG.  Forgot the T hook on PLEDGE until just now.  Played CHANT after eliminating everything else and seing he couldn't really hurt me with this pool, and, well, keeping the NG for that abundance of Is, which should help me go out quickly.

#note It's so weird.  Q still doesn't get certain endgames.  I'm just kinda shocked I figured this one out for myself and was right.  This play, Champ doesn't find at all, yet when added, it's 100% to win!  I draw a vowel, and hook the D to pledge and go out for 20!  The R and N don't hurt me too bad.   I think I can always dump the D at (FA)D for 20, too.
