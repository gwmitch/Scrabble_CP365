#note Didn't realize this took D on the back at the time.
>Noah: AGPQSYZ F7 Q.AY +24 24
#note I mainly considered this, QUAG and AZYGOS. I didn't see GAUZY. GP is pretty bad, so maybe QUAG is better? On the other hand, S hooking QUAY on the next turn will give me more points than QUAG. But QUAG is maybe a little more defensive because it only gives back AG. I probably like GAUZY best ultimately, because it seems to give fewer plays back. AZYGOS probably would've drawn a challenge, as I told him about it later, but I can't really use that kind of hindsight, since I didn't kno much about his play. And QUAG is probably better than my play too.

#note There's not much to do here. I thought I'd keep a good leave, in case he tries to open the board. I'm not sure though. Is neutralizing the O14 X spot with AE or something right? This seemed okay.
