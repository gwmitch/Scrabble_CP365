#note Played too fast. GUIDE, 8D ADIEU, and exchanging are all worth considering. My play is pretty alright too, though.

#note Kind of a weird play. There are two hot spots for my X: under LOCUM, and from the J (with JEUX if I get an E). Plus the warm spot on column L. It's probably worth holding the X to cash it in next turn, but what's the best way to do that? J4 UGH or L4 HUG don't really turn over enough tiles. It seems weird to take only 17 with FLIGHT. Well, I had the right idea, but should have looked longer. FILTH is 10 more points, and pretty much guarantees I can cash the X next turn.
