#note Was going to play VIM, but I'm one letter away from the extension.  Sim still likes VIM or VIMEN

#note I love how this sets up a big Y play, and a small Y play.  I put BRAWL down first, changed it to BRAWN.  Sim agrees that -HLY > -HNY.

#note Scores well, keeps the Y for next turn.  beautiful.

#note I put down ANY(O)NES x2x2 first, but wisely took it back.

#note This play is cute, but opens up a really juicy lane.  Maybe JUT(T)Y 6B.

>Eric_Tran: AEESTTU G1 .TE +21 312
#note Sim likes G3 EAU.  I thought keeping the U might be helpful with the Q unseen.  Bag is vowel heavy, so I can see why G3 ETA is better.  13E OUTEAT is also interesting.

#note Considerd 12L FOU, but the pool looked bad for bingoing from the E.  I thought the 6 pt difference was worthwhile.  14J FA is unnecessarily dangerous.

#note So lucky, last tile blank.  Champ says AGILEnESS is best.  Of course I didn't see that, and played the next best thing.
