#note I should've played it back at 15B, probably, but spread is a consideration.  Maybe I'll be able to hit again.

#note KA(V)A is dumb.  BA(T) F6 27 is reasonable.  I got this confused with CABAL.  For some reason, he thought I played KABA(S), tried to challenge that.  Luckily for him, this is no good.

#note Meh.
>Tom_O'Rourke: AIRSSST B9 SITARS +23 212
#note He told me he had the other S, too.  Q recommends (AH)S.  Reasonable.

#note I don't like JOW or JOY but didn't see much of a choice.  I probably should have played JOY, but neither the Y or the W is very conducive to bingos, especially here.  Was hoping for an LY ending, I guess.  I saw (A)NYWAY (have played it before); didn't see AJOWAN.
>Tom_O'Rourke: ?ABGIOS O7 BOGIeS +42 282
#note Told me his 7th.  GABIONS and BAGNIOS are 95.  Yeah, I really shouldn't have risked opening that up.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEHNY N6 HAY +26 404
#note N7 aYAH 41.  Champ says N9 AH 29, leaving (A)DENYl to go out.  Was really blind do that spot down low, don't know why.
