>Jim_Burlant: EEILMRW 8G MEW +16 16
#note The runner up.  Q prefers turning the rack with MEWLER for 28, docking me roughly 1 point.
>Fran_Silver: IVW H6 VI.W +10 10
>Jim_Burlant: EEIILLR 6G E.IL +9 25
#note This is awful - LIVELIER!
>Fran_Silver: CEIL J8 LICE +21 31
>Jim_Burlant: EGIILNR 11F LING.RIE +68 93
#note Can someone please explain to me how I miss livelier one turn ago and find this in a heartbeat?  Despite my earlier misstep, I'm winning 70%.
>Fran_Silver: ARTZ 5D TZAR +28 59
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEOOY -AAEOO +0 93
#note Q says to play through with ZOEAE, presumably to take out D or K front hooks to EVIL.  Maybe with sometihng more potentially bingo prone like an M, P, or H but I didin't feel the leave warranted playing through.
>Fran_Silver: EHP 5I HEP +23 82
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNORR 4I AMOR +27 120
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNORR --  -27 93
#note Someone shoot me - how many times do I have to lose a turn playing this before I finally learn the only two 4-letter words in that group of letters are MORA and ROAM?
>Fran_Silver: ANQU M9 QU.AN +48 130
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNORR 4J MOR +19 112
#note Shame of that last turn - if I'd looked a little harder I'd have seen enamor 4G, which is definitely best.    This?  Yuck.
>Fran_Silver: F 12L F. +20 150
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAENOR 12B AmARONE +71 183
#note Best bingo; the only other bingo is D1 AERATION.  Despite my best efforts to throw this one away, I'm winning 58%.
>Fran_Silver: IPRT N7 TRIP +33 183
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEJOT O6 JOE +38 221
#note Tunnel vision strikes again.  4A JOTA!  This is weak.
>Fran_Silver: GHOS 14K GOSH +31 214
>Jim_Burlant: ACDDSTU F3 DU.D +23 244
#note Wow - F2 AUDAD beats this by nearly TEN points.  A little surprising until you realize that I have an almost exclusive front hook to AUDAD, unless she has the blank and designates it as a C.  Too bad I didn't know CAUDAD.
>Fran_Silver: NN D11 N.N +3 217
>Jim_Burlant: ACEGKST 14B STACK +46 290
#note Best, and I'm winning 85%.  
>Fran_Silver: O G8 .O +11 228
#note Play incorrectly scored as 10.
>Jim_Burlant: EEGIOOU -EGIOOU +0 290
#note Took a long time on this play before opting to exchange.  She's obviously addled with 1-point tiles and may be close to a bingo.  I didnt see 13B GONE and the obvious row 3 plays (GOODIE, GUIDE) gave her a line for an all too easy 7.  I felt I'd be better positioned to respond if she hit something rather than have to make a comeback play while I was drowning in vowels.
>Fran_Silver: ANORT 15H RATON +24 252
#note Why did I think I had seen this somewhere before?
>Jim_Burlant: DEFSTVY M3 DEFY +28 318
#note Or 3c teddy.  Q has a good defensive recommendation I didn't think of:  D3 FYTTE, which would have prevented the bizarre situation that was about to follow.
>Fran_Silver: ?ABDEES D1 DEBA.EtS +76 328
#note This is not a typographical error.  To this point, Fran had been having a miserable tournament and she was excited that this was the first game in which she'd felt like she was having a decent draw.  In her excitement she not only misdesignated the blank, but did so on the wrong part of the form.  Not only that, in her excitement, she flash-drew.  Between that and the extra time it took me to find the spot where she had incorrectly designated the blank since I had to search the form for it I didn't catch this in time.  I called the directors, and since there was no rule regarding designation of the blank on the wrong part of the form, the ruling came down that, since she had drawn tiles it was too late for me to challenge the play.
>Jim_Burlant: ILOOSTV 1D .IVOT +27 345
#note Q prefers VOID 1A by a hefty margin...but given her next rack it wouldn't have helped.
