>Ryan_Fischer: FFILMOT 8G MOTIFF +36 36
#note Just MOTIF. Hehe, oops.  I was trying to recall which 5s ending in F take a double F.  Matt said GONIFF, I also found PILAFF.

#note Missed I6 UL(T)RARED 63.  Matt saw it, I didn't.  Whoops.
>Liz_Gottlin: AORSSTV 5F VOTAR.SS +61 82
#note Nice.  (And legitimate, unlike the majority of my plays thus far. :))
>Ryan_Fischer: AADELOT 3I DE.AL +18 128
#note I really have trouble fishing to racks with Ds and Ls in them.  Bleh.

#note Or just JI(N)?  JANE's leave is too horrible for words.  That is, good luck making words if you keep that leave~!  :]
>Liz_Gottlin: HI 2C HI +7 264
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGKMRV B2 KEG +36 437
#note This or KAME.  Was gonna play GRAVE until then.  In trying to find out if GRAVEMAKER*/MAKER or anything along those lines is good, I came across MARGRAVE.
>Liz_Gottlin: INW I8 .WIN +11 275
>Ryan_Fischer: AMNORUV H10 MUN +12 449
#note Best to block, I guess.  I didn't quite know how.  ROM is a good play too.
>Liz_Gottlin: I 9M .I +2 277
>Ryan_Fischer: ACELORV O10 VA.L +7 456
#note COEQUATE finally materializes, and I can't play it yet.  She has easy bingos hooking TI, and a hard one in SIRENIAN.  So I figure, block the easy ones, hope she can't find the hard one, then maybe COEQUATE will still be there.
>Liz_Gottlin: ?AEIINS C12 mINE +21 298
#note Also, SANIDINE, which I always miss, and AdE(QUATE).  I thought COEQUATE was the only extension!  There's also TORQUATE, which Matt had as a non-go in a previous game of ours.  It's funny, 'cause Liz was lamenting that COEQUATE didn't come up.  She had stopped tracking, so while talking, she didn't realize that I'd had it on my rack.  She'd thought she'd set me up until I flashed the leftover E, assuring her I'd've had it anyway.  Lesson: don't give up on the tracking.  One I didn't really heed too well.  I played pretty poorly for having eked out a 6-2 second place finish.  Odd that I was the only one to beat Matt, but had trouble with lower seeds due to carelessness (Bruce) and crazy draws (Francis).
