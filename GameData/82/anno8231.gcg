#note Kept the O, as there didn't look like too many places to play or score.  Sim standardly likes -DE.

#note I'm crazy.  I saw ENDO(W) and chose this instead.

#note EDH, same spot, win.  Playing too fast.

#note It was too tempting to try to challenge this off and get my bingo down.  I justified my challenge by hoping Sam had some Collins confusion.
>Sam_Kantimathi: EHIILMR J12 EH +11 267
>Eric_Tran: DEILNSV 13I S.IVED +36 211
#note *Phoney.  Obviously I could have kept the D, but I felt like being greedy.

>Eric_Tran: ?FLLNUY 7B UNF.. +10 221
#note N1 FLU is beautiful.  Didn't see it.  I felt like I needed to open the board.

#note Keeping the O for FIDO looked like a good plan, hoping he doesn't have an S/? and will make a small blocking play.  Sim likes keeping the B.  
>Sam_Kantimathi: AILNRUU A4 ULU +6 316
#note Massive error on Sam's part. He said he thought SULU was Collins.  Such a strange play, given how he was trying so hard to close the board.
>Eric_Tran: ?INOOPS 14N OP +24 277
#note According to plan, I'm able to set up a bingo line.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ABCINQR O14 .I +12 328
#note And he has to make a small blocking play.
>Eric_Tran: ?EGINOS 3A SIGNOrE +70 347
#note I figure there's a good chance the Q is left in the bag, so I set up a juicy Q spot for myself.
>Sam_Kantimathi: ABCLNQR 2E BARN +17 345
>Eric_Tran: ?LLO 1H aLL +9 356
#note ZOMG.  So there were 4 tiles left in the bag.  I only draw LL?, not realizing there's one left.  I'm low on time, and I'm behind on my tracking.  Of course Sam knows there should be 4 tiles, and doesn't say anything.  I make this play, neutralizing the clock, before Sam mentions that there's one tile left.  Director is called, my play stands, I have to draw the last tile (the O) and Sam gets a turn.
>Sam_Kantimathi: CLQ B2 Q. +22 367
>Eric_Tran: O 8A O. +6 362
#note I make this play, catch up on my scoring, and think that I've lost the game by 1.  That would've been a really sucky way to lose.  On a recount, Sam gave himself 4 extra points, and I still win by 3.
