>Ryan_Fischer: EEGILNW 8D WINGLE +28 28
#note Thought of playing WE, but didn't like the leave with the L in it.  So, I figure I could play long with the phony, and maybe he challenges it off and gives me a letter for one of 3 8s.  Not too bright an idea, actually.  Thought there might have been more.

>Ryan_Fischer: DEEMNRV K5 DR.VEMEN +106 134
#note ERM(I)NED E5 40.  Thisz bogus.  I don't know what I was thinking.  He held, but let it go.

>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEEIN 8K .EENA +32 166
>Dave_Leifer: ?AEIPRT E3 PAInT.ER +68 102
#note PARIETES, REPTILIA, APERITIF, and TRAPEZIA are the 86-point plays.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEISX N8 .IXE +27 193
#note Totally whiffed on D4 AXE 34.

>Dave_Leifer: IQZ 3G Q.IZ +54 188
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEJOS 7C JA.O +26 252
#note So... I can kill the S(WINGLE) hook with JA(T)O/JO(T)A, or play JEA(n).  Same points, worse leave, less defensive.  I want whatever bingo he plays, unless he hits the Y or A, to help me.

>Dave_Leifer: CDEOR O11 DECOR +30 232
>Ryan_Fischer: AAERSTT J9 RAT +17 282
#note J10 AT 14 is worth the 3-point sacrifice to keep the R, I guess.
>Dave_Leifer: GORSS M3 GROSS.. +30 262
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIOSTT 15H TOASTIE. +77 359
>Dave_Leifer: AF 14J FA +28 290
>Ryan_Fischer: AAINORW H12 WAI. +11 370
#note Played WAI(T) to make bingoing harder, play 1 more tile than I would with WA(P), and get rid of another vowel.
>Dave_Leifer: FHO G11 FOH +27 317
#note Though I bleed spread a bit by doing it.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACINNOR 1H .ONIC +13 383
#note I guess Champ isn't too concerned about the Y lane left.  It says F12 RAN 17.
>Dave_Leifer: ?DNNRSU N8 ....D +16 333
#note Somewhere around here he said he was one off of UNDERT(OW)S, missing the T.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAHNRVY F12 NAH +26 409
#note I almost got it right.  I played NAH to keep (O)VARY.  Champ wants RAH because of... well, to be honest, I don't know what.  It sticks you with the V if you draw the E then, and recommends YE hooking (YEUK)Y after opp plays G(R)UM.  Weird.
