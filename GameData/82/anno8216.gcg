>Victor_Chua: AEEIN 8D AINEE +12 12
>Toh_Weibin: AEILMTU 9F UM +16 16
#note Saw LUMINATE* but decided it had to be phony. Should have considered ALUM 7D or ULTIMA C7, which appears to be the best. I don't think there's too much potential in AEILT.
>Victor_Chua: BCU 10D CUB +24 36
>Toh_Weibin: AEILRTZ H1 LATERIZ. +104 120
#note Well, as I was saying...
>Victor_Chua: EIINSUV 3E UNI.IVES +63 99
>Victor_Chua: EIINSUV --  -63 36
>Toh_Weibin: BDEHINT D10 .HIB +22 142
#note Was deciding between B(A)T(C)HED and this but keeping DENT seemed like a worthy proposition on this board.
>Victor_Chua: EIINSUV 5G E.UVIN +18 54
>Toh_Weibin: ?DENQTW E7 Q. +11 153
#note Didn't want to play QAT because I wanted to leave the possibilities through the A open. I noticed that I'd have (L)ETDoWNS if I drew an O. But anyway, QAT should be better :).
>Victor_Chua: AJT C12 TAJ +30 84
>Toh_Weibin: ?DENRTW K4 W.NTeRED +72 225
>Victor_Chua: ?EFIIIS 1F vI.IFIES +61 145
>Toh_Weibin: EEENNPY J9 EYEN +33 258
#note Prefer EYEN to PENNY.
>Victor_Chua: AHLLO L11 HALLO +25 170
>Toh_Weibin: DEGGNOP 15H DOGG. +24 282
#note I think DOGGO here and DOGGO 15K are close. POGGE leapt into my mind but is inferior.
>Victor_Chua: ARTY 4K .ARTY +34 204
>Toh_Weibin: AEEINPU 3L EAU +15 297
#note I14 PAU(L)IN would have been cool, but potentially dangerous. I did see 14G EPAU(L)E but that looked insane. Should probably have played something like PEIN on top for more score - EAU gives him a possible __XY play.
>Victor_Chua: MOO M12 MOO +20 224
>Toh_Weibin: ACDEINP 3C PEDAN.IC +80 377

>Victor_Chua: AELV 4A VEAL +30 254
>Toh_Weibin: ADGORTW A1 GRA. +24 406
#note Needed to win this game, so I blocked. Was considering something like N11 GAWD - N9 TOWARD looks like the best.
>Victor_Chua: EIKRR N11 KIRRE +32 286
>Victor_Chua: EIKRR --  -32 254
>Toh_Weibin: DFOSSTW N13 WOF +30 436
#note I thought it rather unlikely that he'd have a very high scoring play even if I opened this up.
>Victor_Chua: EIKRR O14 RE +25 279
>Toh_Weibin: DOPSSST O1 POS. +31 467
#note I was sure of the win at this point. I knew S(EYEN) so wanted to keep the hook for later, without realising there was an X spot over there. Well, turns out I blocked a possible NIX(Y) too.

>Toh_Weibin: DSSTT 8J S.DS +14 481
>Toh_Weibin: DSSTT --  -14 467
#note Honestly, I didn't know SED didn't take an S.

>Toh_Weibin: DSSTT 8J S..T +18 485
>Victor_Chua: NOR 8J ....ON +36 378
#note There's no excuse for me giving away spread like that anyway.
