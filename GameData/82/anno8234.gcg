#note this play sucks. I thought I was being clever. I thought about pion, which is one of the top choices, but decided it was too volatile. really, though, there's a blank out there. I should be trying to get turnover somehow or other, and I can either play something like PION which is kinda volatile or exchange, which is one of t he top options. this play sucks. I could also have played lap.

#note the blanki was the last tile in the bag! ANOPIA dominates the sim here. the timing seems completely wrong to me because you end up with five tiles and give him the first shot at a wide open board, but quackle heavily favors it.

#note there are no wins here. any of my good plays give him outs. I should actually just play off one tile to keep him from going out.
