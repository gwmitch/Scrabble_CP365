#player2 Matt_H. Matt H.
>Matt_: AADENTV 8D VANDA +26 26
#note Quickly debated passing in hope of a A for VANADATE.  There are 3 Collins 8's in this rack as well.
>Matt_H.: EIRRSST D4 STRI.ERS +72 72
>Matt_: DEGLTWY 5B WE.LY +22 48
#note Whiffed on the back hook of VANDA: WYLED is best, this not so much.
>Matt_H.: HOSY B2 SHO.Y +44 116
>Matt_: ?ADGNNT 11D .TANDiNG +86 134
#note Luckbox.
>Matt_H.: EFLU A1 FUEL +34 150
>Matt_: AOOOPSU A6 APO +20 154
#note Didn't want to get killed here with a B or M word, hence my choice.
>Matt_H.: AII J10 I.IA +6 156
>Matt_: AJOOSTU H10 A.JUST +66 220
#note JOUST L8 for 50 as well; STANDING does take an S.
>Matt_H.: GIM 10C G.IM +25 181
>Matt_: ELOOPRX 14B PLEXOR. +36 256
#note ORYX 30 keeping ELOP is interesting, didn't see it.  I liked the turnover and taking out bingoes to the S.
>Matt_H.: EEW 13C EWE +30 211
>Matt_: CEEEIOR 9F OE +13 269
#note Quackle likes taking out row 15 with OE instead, or 6D ROE which I contemplated.  This is 4th.
>Matt_H.: DEIT 15A TIDE +33 244
>Matt_: CEEIKRU 15H .RUCK +16 285
#note Not very good.  Of Quackle's choices I like 6F ECU, as it's not reckless while balancing the rack.  7H KUE is too volatile at this point I think.
>Matt_H.: ABIO 7G OBIA +17 261
#note Perhaps setting up his Z?
>Matt_: CDEEIIM 6J MICE +24 309
#note Played this instead of MEDIC because of the 3 unseen O's.  Quackle also suggests MEDII, which I missed.
>Matt_H.: AIOZ L2 AZOI. +32 293
>Matt_: DEEINOV 8J DEVEIN +48 357
#note Or NEVOID for 47 to keep the E instead of the O.
>Matt_H.: Q 5K Q. +44 337
#note Can't seem to shake him at all.
>Matt_: ?ANOORU 3K A.O +24 381
#note With the blank in hand and only one vowel unseen, the game is sewn up.  Didn't want to play ZOO because of the other unseen N.
>Matt_H.: F 4L .F +10 347
>Matt_: ?BNORTU N1 RUNT +27 408
#note Wow; NUTBROwN for 86/80 along Column O.  I think I even saw this on JT recently, but didn't have the time or wherewithal to look for it.  Chose this instead of BUNT because I knew he'd play EH O1 either way, and I can go out with BOs/TRUCKS.
>Matt_H.: EGHLNRT O1 EH +26 373
#note (TRUCK)LER 42!  LIGHTEN/LIGHTER is better than EH since I can't hook it with my blank and go out
>Matt_: ?BO M13 BOs +19 427
#note 6F OBa 24.
>Matt_:  (GLNRT) +12 439
#note Gave him an extra 10 points by misadding at EWE, so final score was recorded at 439-383.
