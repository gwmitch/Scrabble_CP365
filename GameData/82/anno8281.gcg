>Ricky_Purnomo: CCEMU 8H CECUM +28 28
#note Here's the deal - Victor, Hubert and I were on the same number of wins, and I had the highest spread among the three. I needed to win this with some spread to secure the victory.
>Toh_Weibin: AELNTUV L8 .VULE +20 20
#note Missing EV(E)NTUAL! You can guess the eventual result..
>Ricky_Purnomo: AGKOO 11G KAGOO. +22 50
>Toh_Weibin: AIILNRT 12D TRAIL +21 41
#note Ricky's blocked INERTIAL.. Not sure what's best here, but it isn't my move - INTIL would probably work better. 12G is worth considering. Maybe even H12 (A)ALII.
>Ricky_Purnomo: DGIIOOP J4 IODI. +12 62
>Toh_Weibin: AGILNST 4F TAIL.NGS +70 111
>Toh_Weibin: EEFOOVW (challenge) +5 116
#note Wasn't sure of ANTIL(O)GS, which would have been a 4 timer.
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?BENORT 3B REBOaNT +74 136
>Toh_Weibin: EEFOOVW 2C WOOF +42 158
>Ricky_Purnomo: AQUY 1A QUAY +78 214
>Toh_Weibin: EEEERTV 13C VEE +16 174
#note Wasn't sure of V(AL)ETE - but VEE blocked Ricky's INJU(R)IES, as he told me after the game. I played this, instead of at 4A or 5E to keep the board open for comebacks.
>Ricky_Purnomo: IJNU E8 INJU.. +26 240
>Toh_Weibin: EEIIRTT M4 .ITE +5 179
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?AEINSS 13G SpINASE +87 327
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?AEINSS --  -87 240
>Toh_Weibin: AEGIRTZ B3 .ITZ +33 212
#note Not a very good move, but I thought he could score well if he played a bingo down line 5 - so I blocked the line keeping the R for a possible INJURE(R) hook.
>Ricky_Purnomo: ?AEINSS 14E SArNIES +74 314

>Ricky_Purnomo: EHOORRW (challenge) +5 369
#note Gave the nickel for YOBS.
>Toh_Weibin: ABDEHNX 15K HEXAD +56 330
>Ricky_Purnomo: EHOORRW 14M OH +29 398
>Toh_Weibin: ABEINPT 13M BAP +44 374
#note BA is the best play here, opening a line for a bingo that he is almost certain to block. At least it forces him to (probably) take a lower score, allowing me to block J10 next move (his move strongly telegraphs an A on his rack).
>Ricky_Purnomo: AMW 10H MAW +37 435
>Toh_Weibin: DEILNOT M10 TE +16 390
#note KAGOOLE* - should have played moves I was sure of, not being far in front of Hubert in terms of spread. (Hubert had just lost)
