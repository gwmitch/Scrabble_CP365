>Logan: AEINRTU 8F URANITE +66 66
>Tunnicliffe: FLNNOPR K4 FRON. +16 16
#note Seems okay on static, but drops a bit in the sim, because it seems to give a lot back. Maybe just FLUOR.
>Logan: AUX 4K .AUX +28 94
>Tunnicliffe: ADIJLNP J6 JA.L +54 70
>Logan: EH N2 HE. +26 120
>Tunnicliffe: DEIINPP O1 PIN +22 92
#note The other option is just PI.

>Logan: AAGIM 11C AMIGA. +18 168
>Tunnicliffe: AAGIKRT M1 KAG. +32 216
#note 12A KATA or KRAIT are options. But I was feeling good about AIRT on this board.
>Logan: EHISSTW G2 SWITHE.S +73 241
#note I'm guessing he overlooked 14F SWEETISH, which ends up being a huge break for me.
>Tunnicliffe: AGIIRRT 14A IRRIGAT. +72 288
>Logan: ABBOT 12A ABBOT +34 275
>Tunnicliffe: ?EEILOO K11 LOOIE +18 306
#note I might have played this too fast. Quackle likes F3 OLEO or OLIO. It seemed counterintuitive to shut down the board with a blank, though.
>Logan: DEOT H1 TOED +33 308
>Tunnicliffe: ?DEEESU 15A SEED +36 342
#note Or just DEE. They're close.
>Logan: ADEV 15K .VADE +39 347
>Tunnicliffe: ?EFNOUW 14M FEW +34 376
#note Bingo miss here: nEWFOUND. It's not something I can expect myself to find without having studied it before, but I stared at that quadrant of the board for a good three minutes, so it probably should have jumped out at me. Anyways, huge equity loss here which should have cost me.
>Logan: ?MNORVY A7 hRYVN. +33 380
#note Adam's actual rack. His choice is nowhere on Quackle's radar, but sims to the top. He basically needs to draw the Z and/or blank and pray I am stuck with unworkable tiles. He was also considering 6J JOMON, which would have worked out better this time.
