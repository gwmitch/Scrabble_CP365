#note should've just played FOU at 7M - it's safer, though with my play I at least have a fork to guarantee one triple line will stay open.

#note My opponent's bingo blocked LUMINOUS. I think the U's are finally done at least. Best.

#note Forget about MIDSOLE/MELOIDS, oops. Not good.

#note Best are COALBIN/LAMBKIN/ALBUMIN at A6.
>scott_jackson: ANNOVXZ E5 VOX +39 245
#note Didn't play ZAX because it allows a big possible parallel play on the C column from the DWS. Best.

>scott_jackson: ADEENNZ B6 DEN +19 264
#note Wanted to hold onto the Z since there were two triple lines open. Best is K9 ADZ (36.2%, my play 31.2%)

#note Wanted to limit the chances of getting Q as much as possible. My play is best, second best is CZ(ARS) which I also considered but would give tons of playback down column L. I'm honestly surprised it sims so high. One advantage is that I don't have to deal with getting C stuck at least, but I give myself another chance to draw the Q as well.
