#note "TEND sets up a hopeful spot."
>Bing: AAEEGHT 10C GETA +15 126
#note Dunno what was right here - probably EATH J11 is better, but I wanted to take out the S spot.

#note "Thought about ORIEL, but liked this better."
>Bing: ENOSTUU 4I UNTU.ES +24 212
#note Nowhere for TENUOUS. Maybe ROUE L2 instead.
>Noah: AEILMOR 3H AMI +25 163
#note "(T)O looks like a great option. It keeps a nice leave and opens up a great seven lane that's hard to block. AEROLI(TIC) is a cute play."
>Bing: EINNOUU 2D UNION +9 221
#note Probably way too scared of the D setup (which turned out to be a bluff). I just couldn't see much else worth doing.
>Noah: AEGILOR C7 LOG.IER +24 187
#note "(T)OG looks like a good play, here. (C)IGAR is also good. I just didn't think of those plays. AEROLITIC is also there."

>Noah: EEIPRSZ 3B ZEP +32 272
#note "Thought of ZEES and ZEE, but ZEE blocks bingo lanes, and ZEES seems to give too many comebacks. I hated playing this, giving away a buttload of hooks, one of which Dave probably has. I didn't think of PREZ, though, which Dave pointed out after the game. Seems like the play here!"
