>Winter: ALNRRTZ E7 Z.NAL +39 63
>Eric_Goldstein: P 10D P.. +12 38
>Winter: FFORRTU H7 R.FF +10 73
#note Eric's P(AX) makes me suspect fishing, so I want to make the board a little tougher rather than opening it up.
>Eric_Goldstein: INOPST 11H SPINTO +27 65
#note What the hell kinda freaky-ass word is this??? And does it take an S?
>Winter: ANOORTU 6D OAR +20 93
#note OUTRAN is too risky.
>Eric_Goldstein: DV J10 V.D +15 80
>Winter: DELNOTU 13F LOUDEN +18 111
#note So focused on wondering if OUTLEND* is good that I don't even look at the R.
>Eric_Goldstein: AI 12L AI +10 90
>Winter: HIJMOQT C3 MOTH +25 136
>Eric_Goldstein: BINR D1 BRIN +26 116

>Winter: AEIJNQT B2 QAT +32 189
>Eric_Goldstein: ABTU 2H TUBA +14 148
>Winter: EEGIJNS M10 J..N +22 211
#note Totally whiff on (TUBA)E, but J(OI)N has advantage of blocking (SPINTO)S, which I've no idea of.
>Eric_Goldstein: DGIU 14A GUID +22 170
>Winter: EEGGISU 6H GIGUE +24 235
#note No idea if GRIFF takes S, but it's clearly the best play.
>Eric_Goldstein: AIY A12 YA.I +36 206
>Winter: EEEERSW M2 EWERS +24 259
#note Takes out the last easy bingo line.
>Eric_Goldstein: AEER J2 .ARE.E +9 215
>Winter: ?CEEHOS 1M HOE +30 289
#note Don't want to open, but that E is not the easiest thing to play from, and I should be able to survive a bingo anyway.
>Eric_Goldstein: AEW L3 AWE. +31 246
>Winter: ?CEMRST 2M .M +16 305
#note There's no bingo off the E, but I can't be sure of that. Some freaky (E)YE bingo worries me. I saw SECReT, but a freaky bingo off the T to the TWS loses.
>Eric_Goldstein: ?DEEKOS 8J SeEKED +43 289
>Winter: ?CERSTY 14L STYE +26 331
#note Can't risk challenging SeEKED*. Won't find plays like (D)ECRYpTS without more anagramming.
>Eric_Goldstein: O -  +0 289
>Winter: ?CR O12 CR.d +24 355
#note Need a lot more anagramming to find (D)ECRYpTS.
>Winter:  (O) +2 357
