#note Uh-oh. Smurfy blogged about playing RUNKLES, and he made reference to a front hook, which I COULDN'T REMEMBER. Only C or G seemed to make sense, but I wondered if he was just joking about the hook.

#note Had to take the chance, and I got it past him!!! This is even better than the Avrin SNORKLE* story, but not as good as the Mallick (PLOTZ)ERs* one.

#note ...he had this play! Really glad I went for GRUNKLES, although if I hadn't I probably would have taking that N spot anyway.

#note I really hated this AISU leave, but all the better plays seemed to take out lines I want to leave open. I can win without a bingo, but Paul is low on time, and more lines will make him more nervous.
