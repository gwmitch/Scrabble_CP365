#note Not seeing plays like QUO(TA)/(FID)O is why I'll never be good, but at least I didn't go for JOUK (and risk Q stick).

#note Tough, tough rack. David is close enuf that an exchange allows him to catch up. Also, if I exchange, I'm keeping the S, Z, and either the R or T, plus the H could be useful in the endgame. So if I'm only exchanging 3 or 4, why not score?

#note Had to hope the tile pool wouldn't yield a freaky bingo thru the V or G. At least iN(G)S is impossible.
