>Toh_Weibin: ?IMOTTW 8F TWO +12 12
#note TOWT is best on CP, but I have my reservations. TWIT follows.

#note Pleased to find this! Had only seen AMbITTY in this rack (missed the other one)

#note This was going to be a closer game than I thought...  (you never know with Hubert)

>Toh_Weibin: EIINPRU 15K INURE +27 252
#note 13C E(U)RIP(I) is a beautiful play. Other than that, stuff like UNRIP is better.

>Toh_Weibin: AEEIOPR N1 EA +20 307
#note This might have been the fatal error of the game. I was too preoccupied with the spot I'd just opened up, fearing a 40 pointer there. POI(S)E M9 is best on CP, followed by PORIE(R) B10
>Hubert_Wee: ?DEFJLT 8J J.LTED +45 290
#note And I promptly get punished. Ouch!
>Toh_Weibin: DEIOPRU 14M OUP +20 327
#note B10 POUDE(R) is better. Was trying to move quickly as I lost (wasted) quite a bit of time on the previous move.

>Hubert_Wee: ABEHILV (challenge) +5 366
#note Excellent find!
>Toh_Weibin: CDEINPR 13C C.P +18 345
#note CP rates D(U)P better by about 5% winning percentage (and 13.8 equity). Don't exactly understand why, but I guess it's related to the S hook, the probability of drawing a bingo, or the D at O8 which makes keeping a D worse.
