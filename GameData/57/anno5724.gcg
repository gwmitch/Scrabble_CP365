>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIMOPT 8C OPTIMAE +78 78
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIMOPT --  -78 0
#note Are you kidding me??? Dude doesn't deserve to win any games playing shit like that.
>Winter: EEEHIMT 8G HEME +18 18
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIMOPT 7H AMP +25 25
>Winter: ABEIOST 6J OBI +14 32
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AOR 5I ORA +20 45
>Winter: AEFSTTV 4K FAT +20 52
#note FUCK--WHIFFED on SORA!
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AL 3L LA +10 55
#note His clock down to 14:40 by this point, which would be okay IF he were actually scoring. Time = equity, bro.
>Winter: AEQSTVY 6F QAT +35 87
#note Stupid miss.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEGT 2K GATE +16 71
>Winter: ELNOSVY N4 ENVY +25 112
>Jeff_Fiszbein: FILRST 4D FLIRTS +22 93
#note Don't know his other tile, but this just seemes weak. FIL/(H)I/(TAE)L might be better.
>Winter: EEKLNOS 3C KOEL +25 137
#note Damn, really thought KOEL was best than the ELNS leave.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DV E2 V..D +16 109
>Winter: EEINRSX O7 EXINE +41 178
#note Wow, I really need to brush up on those four-to-make fives. Making so many mistakes here that I might have to stop ragging on Fishy.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: INT H1 TIN. +12 121
>Winter: AEHLRRRS 12J HALERS +34 212
#note Hoping for a challenge, but instead this play killed me with what I drew after.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: GNT K11 T.NG +10 131
#note Fuck--here's where the game goes south.
>Winter: DIOPRUU O1 PROD +44 256
#note Tough call, but I figure I'm going to get bingoed on regardless, so I need the points.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?CENOSY 15I COYNEsS +95 226
#note Damn, I expected a bingo, but not this heavy. Given my tiles, I wa starting to worry.
>Winter: EIINOUU 14K .ENII +20 276
#note Problem with exchanging is that a 20-30 point play at 14K cuts my lead in half and lets Jeff get dangerously close. 
>Jeff_Fiszbein: DGO M7 DOG +18 244
>Winter: DEIOOUU 11I OU.ED +16 292
#note Still fearing that no scoring will lose me the game, and I can't imagine that my draw is going to be as bad as it turned out.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: J 8L J. +17 261
>Winter: AEIRUUU H10 UREA +12 304
#note GODDAMN IT!!! One more tile in the bag and I could play URAEI. Given my UU leave, I fear that giving Jeff full knowledge of my rack will also lose me the game.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?AIRSWZ 14B WIZARdS +95 356
#note AARRGHH!!!
