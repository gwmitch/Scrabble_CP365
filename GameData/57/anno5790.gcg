>Jim_Burlant: AEGGINO 8G GO +6 6
#note Sim prefers 8H AGO.  
>Keith_Smith: GOY I7 GOY +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGINS G7 E.G +8 14
#note Quackle prefers J9 AE; I would rather unload the G.
>Keith_Smith: BILM F4 LIMB +18 35
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEINS E5 AE +12 26
#note Best.

#note Best.
>Keith_Smith: ?AEFKNV -?AEF +0 57
>Jim_Burlant: ACEFKRS J8 FECK +32 109
#note Quackle prefers J8 KAF, docking me hefty equity for this choice.  
>Keith_Smith: ?ELLOSW K2 bELLOWS +77 134
#note Guessing Keith wasn't sure about the S hook on FECK.  12D placement scores 7 more.
>Jim_Burlant: AAOORSU -AOOU +0 109
#note Quackle's preference is 11I OKA 14.  I saw that play and passed.  For a leave of AEIRS I'd have done that,  but felt that AORSU could become ghastly with the wrong draw.
>Keith_Smith: AMRRU D3 MURRA +22 156
>Jim_Burlant: ADIORST L3 DO +13 122
#note Nothing stands out here, with the 10th choice simming within 3 points of the sim winners, L1 RADIO or L2 AROID.  This play gives up mild equity (not quite 3 pts).
>Keith_Smith: NRU C2 RUN +16 172
>Jim_Burlant: AEFIRST C7 FAIREST +89 211
#note Back in the lead, 60% winning chances now.
>Keith_Smith: ATV 12A VA.T +22 194
>Jim_Burlant: AAHINQT 10B T.ANQ +36 247
#note No-brainer of a play here, at 72% winning chances.  But I'm wondering what he's setting up down the A column?
>Keith_Smith: ETX A12 .EXT +42 236
>Jim_Burlant: ACEHIPV M1 PAH +30 277
#note 11J KIVA and K11 AVE finish 1-2 in the sim with this choice coming third.  Saw the 30 pts and felt I had to take them.
>Keith_Smith: AIISTUY -AIIS +0 236
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEIIV 11E AIDE +25 302
#note I was less worried about bingoing thatn keeping up a sustained run of scoring.  I thought that if I played AIDE I could potentially set up a play of EVICT, EVITE, EVADE, etc. at H11.  K11 AVID wins the sim. 
>Keith_Smith: J 6J J. +25 261
>Jim_Burlant: CDIOOUV 8A OV. +18 320
#note yuck - not the draw I was hoping for.  What do you do here if you can't play VODOU?  At this point I felt I should just unload the V.  Surely it's not that dangerous putting an O at 8A, is it?  I couldn't think of UPDO, thus whiffung on the star play at 1L.  3F CONI also sims pretty well.
>Keith_Smith: ?EINNRU A1 NEUtRIN. +71 332
#note Small consolation:  he'd have still had N3 sUNNIER and 15A TENURINg if I hadn't hung the O.
>Jim_Burlant: CDIIOOU -IOOU +0 320
#note Didn't see any of the star plays - a complete whiff.  Ugh.  K11 IODIC wins the sim at 30% winning chances, wiht this choice coming in at 22.  I'm guessing that combination of late-day fatigue plus frustration of what I perceived at the time as yet another ill-timed poor draw was catching up with me, causing very poor decisions.  This was a completely playable rack, but I just brainlocked.
>Keith_Smith: BOP E1 BOP +14 346
>Jim_Burlant: ACDEEIN 1M .IE +15 335
#note Too fishy - EPIC is clearly better.
>Keith_Smith: ITTY 11J .ITTY +24 370
>Jim_Burlant: ACDENRS H10 R.CANE +33 368
#note I initially saw ED H11 to create another line on row 13...but once I saw recane for 33 I put this down almost on autopilot.  What makes this choice so atrocious was that I still had 10 minutes on my clock, and I had more than enough time to determine whether a bingo fish was the right play given the pool or if I should make the game close and take it to an end game.    Given that a human opponent under 3 minutes on his clock will play very differently than Quackle, I should have taken this into account.  Post-mortem, we figured out that had I put down ED, I would have won the game as the first tile out of the bag was an I, and since he was running low on time he probably would not have found an effective block.  Had I fished, I would have had an unblockable ACEINRS as my final rack.  Frustrating, but on the other hand - as poorly as I played this game, I really didn't deserve the win.
