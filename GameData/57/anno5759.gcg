#note the huge sim winner is I8 (WE)B for 8.  14g B(E)CK is 2nd best as it doesnt screw up row 15 as much as my play.

#note 3I QUB(IT), e7 QU(AI)N(T) are better. Mine had a huge risk-reward component to it. too much - its a bad play

#note i liked this as it threw up a U and a R into new bingo lanes. whilst keeping the column O line. gave me 5 tiles to draw, hoping to get the ?.  The best play however is N8 (USQUE)BAE for 54.

#note this has 94% win. With the unseen pool, the bingos that Q is worried about are AiRBORN(E) and fORBORN(E) down column O.
