>james: AEEEHNR 8G HE +10 10
#note simming this, a lot of plays are close. i dont like my play - why not EH? even. Quackle likes NEE.
>will: BFILOSW G5 FIS.BOWL +73 73
#note 2 more points than BLOWFISH
>james: AEENNOR 11D ENO. +14 24
#note q prefers ANE(W). all plays sim close
>will: DEEI 12B EIDE +18 91
>james: AENNNRU I8 NUN +10 34
#note after >500 its at 4pl - 5g (F)UNNER by a whisker over I6 NUN.  tbh, all these plays are uber close in the sim
>will: IIUUU -IIUUU +0 91
>james: ACENORU 5G .ROUNCE +24 58
#note Clear whiff. OUNCE H1 is best.  However, my play is bunched with (F)URNACE, h1 CANOE or OCREA.
>will: AEGRSTU H1 AUGE. +21 112
#note Will said he saw this word as he reeled off the 8s in this rack after the game including AUGUSTER. just missed the spot at J4.
>james: AGILRST B7 GLARI.ST +72 130
#note rewarded for my mistake
>will: AIRSTTT J4 T.T +5 117
#note Q loves F6 TAT - much more than TIT.  After TAT, next best is 10F T(O). bit of a weird position.
>james: ?BFJNQV 6F Q. +31 161
#note Will pointed out my boneheadedness post game.  If I do the Q & J thing for the next 2 turns, I must do J(O) before Q(I) as there's a chance I draw an I for QI f6. J(O) wins the sim, followed just by f6 Qi then my play a slither behind
>will: AAIRSST N2 TARSIAS +81 198
>james: ?BFJNPV 10F J. +50 211
#note ok. am i gonna turn down 50 points here to exchange? quackle says no, take the pts.
>will: ALOZ M3 ZO.AL +59 257
#note whoa.
>james: ?BFNPVX 9A F.X +21 232
#note here is where a better scrabble player shows why they are that and why i'm not that good. I dont think about using the blank here, instead making this play - i was thinking that if i draw any vowel i should have a good O1 or perhaps O8 play.  Q says i have to play F(L)?X here.
>will: DHIOT O7 DHOTI +46 303
>james: ??BENPV O1 BaP +33 265
#note this wins the sim with BoP.
>will: YY 1G Y.Y +9 312
>james: ?EIMNPV 7E VI. +17 282
#note I'm way off the sim here. 8b (L)EV 49%, 10b (R)IP or (R)IM 39%, n10 IMP 36%, 7f I(S)M and my play are 32%. If you look at 'details' tab, the reason that LEV, RIP, RIM do so well is that they let Will score on average 10 fewer pts next turn.
>will: GIORU C3 GUIRO +18 330
>james: ?EEMNOP 8A E. +21 303
#note there's one 7 in this rack, and it plays at A1. I didn't take enuf time to find it, and i should've. d1 PEON & d2 MOP do better than my fish, probably because they keep open the A1 bingo line.
>will: EEK A13 EEK +25 355
>james: ?AEMNOP J9 MANrOPE +76 379
#note only 7 in this rack. i have to play it right?
