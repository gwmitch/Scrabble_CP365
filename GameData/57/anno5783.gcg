#note Especially considering the opponent, it's pretty risky to open like this. Playing a word starting with C makes it really easy for Gibson to control the board from the get-go (as you'll soon see). The sim suggests -NUW, or WANT, or CAW. All these plays are close, but in retrospect I don't think I like the one I chose.
>David_Gibson: EV J6 VE. +14 14
#note This is already ugly.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAINRUW -AUW +0 12
#note Sim-approved. If I don't trade, bad things will happen. No matter what I play (CAW? VAW? URANIC?), I'm gonna score 9-10 points, and he's gonna score a ton more while limiting my counterplay options. It's a recipe for disaster.

#note No, Quackle, I am not playing DEACONRY here. If he wants to close the board now, then let him, damn it. I'm up 67. CARBOYED was just a miss though.

#note How lucky.
>David_Gibson: GNOW E11 GOWN +30 142
>Evans_Clinchy: DHILPSU N10 HU.LS +32 234
#note You could make a case for a five in the bottom-left corner (HILUS, PILUS, PULIS), but I didn't really feel like opening anything there. This seems safer, no?
>David_Gibson: JMP H7 J.MP +34 176
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DIOPQR O5 QI +15 249
#note Yeah, I suppose PYOID O11 is better...
>David_Gibson: ABIT D12 BAIT +29 205
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DNOPRS 13C P.. +16 265
#note This accomplishes two things -- blocks the opening he just created in line C, and fishes for any one of the HIIIIII in the pool to hit DRONISH E3.

#note HATTERIA -- noun -- a giant box of luck that opens whenever awesome Scrabble players are sitting across from you
>David_Gibson: EFIV H1 FIVE. +36 306
>Evans_Clinchy: AEGNSUX A11 NEXUS +41 440
#note AX C7 is really cool... it sets up DUES A5 for next turn. There's also NEXUS at 8A, which I somehow didn't see.
>David_Gibson: CEEIOTU A1 CITE. +33 339
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEG J14 AA +9 449
#note Correct to block DOUSE. Incorrect to do it this way. GAE J12 scores better.
