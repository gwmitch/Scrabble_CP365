>Winter: ALMOORT 6J MOOR +28 156
#note Really wanted to try some kind of phony here, but didn't think MOTORAL* was plausible enough. Maybe (S)TROOMAL* would have worked.
>Libero_Paolella: ADENR 1D .ANDER +30 113
>Winter: AALMSTU 10E T.ALAMUS +69 225
#note Thanks for not playing (Z)ANDER, hoss. Although I wish I would have played T(H)ALAMI on account of Paolo's Italian heritage.

>Libero_Paolella: ?ELNSTU 3H .rUNTLES +66 284
#note Kinda glad he got this--I was starting to feel bad for the guy. First Italy's economy is in tatters, and then he can't get a bingo down--that's just too much.

#note JE(S)SE, we miss YOU!!!
