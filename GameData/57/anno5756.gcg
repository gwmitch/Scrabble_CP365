>Jim_Burlant: ?BHILOO 8G HOBO +18 18
#note Either this or BOHO 8E.  63% winning chances, probably due to the presence of the blank in this rack.
>Jeff_Reeves: EEW 9G EWE +24 24
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACDILL 10I LID +11 29
#note Gotta know the bingo to play it; I suspected there might have been something here, but I would never have known the 15000-probability CAuDILLO.  As far as the non-bingo choices go, this is best, with 9E CLEWED also being worth consideration.  Interestingly, I don't even give up 10 points of equity in the sim for this choice relative to the bingo, probably because it slots the 3x3 and only scores 64 points.
>Jeff_Reeves: EINV 11J NEVI +22 46
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACEEFL M10 F.CE +18 47
#note Best.  The other choices - M8 FACILE, M8 FECIAL outscore this but sime a couple of points down, and I'm guessing there are 2 reasons for this.  First, they open up the O8 triple, and secondly they break up too much of this promising rack.
>Jeff_Reeves: AGIINPU -AGIINPU +0 46
#note This is a Quackle-generated rack; I have no idea what Jeff's rack was here.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AELNTT K2 TALENTs +71 118
#note Quackle gives marginal preference to LATENTs or LATTENs.  I can undersantd (maybe) LATENTs...but LATTENs with the front-F hook?  That strikes me as being reckless.  Can someone explain why LATTENs wins the sim here?
>Jeff_Reeves: EKR 2K .REK +16 62
>Jim_Burlant: AAGIOSV N8 VIA +15 133
#note Now the problems really begin.  I didn't think it was late enough to burn my S and I had no idea what was going to happen here.  Didn't kow GAVIALS, not sure why I didn't see VOILA or VIOLA.  This play takes a huge hit in the sim justifiably.
>Jeff_Reeves: HTY 10E THY +26 88
>Jim_Burlant: AAGLOSS O10 GAOL +13 146
#note Didn't know any of the L1 plays.  Didn't think that 14J GOAS scored enough to justify opeing up row 15. 
>Jeff_Reeves: EOQRU E7 QUO.ER +30 118
>Jim_Burlant: AAEMSSX 13A MAXES +44 190
#note Quackle prefers 3M MAX keeping SEAS, with this play coming in 4th, at a loss of 7 pts.  I prefer to unload one of my S's as I'd rather not let him hook QUOTER if he has an S. 
>Jeff_Reeves: FIR 14B RIF +30 148
>Jim_Burlant: ADIIISU -IIIU +0 190
#note Quackle's top choicdes are 4J ILIAD or 4J ILIA - I dunno - the points really don't seem worth the less-than-ideal leave.  Because of the 4 A's and 2 I's in the pool, quackle prefers that I throw in the A and keep an I.  
>Jeff_Reeves: AGIPRW 6F WARPI.G +23 171
>Jim_Burlant: AAADNSU 8M A.A +18 208
#note Wasn't thrilled about keeping the U but didn't know any of the top choices except NAUSEA and didn't think I should burn the S.  This play does clear out the worst of this mess, doesn't it? Best play (15D SAUNA)  is now at 68% winning chances with this play coming in at 63.  I'm docked roughly 4 points for this choice - this isn't that bad, is' it?
>Jeff_Reeves: DIJR M1 J.RID +26 197
>Jim_Burlant: AADNSUU -AUU +0 208
#note Quackle prefers either 14I UNAUS 17  keeping AD, with 15D SAUNA coming in second.  I didn't like that at all, as there was still plenty of good stuff in the pool that would inevitably make me regret burning the S.  Also - while I'm still taking time on these positions and am not making knee-jerk decisions, by now I'm more than a little annoyed that my racks just are not cleaning up despite my best efforts to balance them.  
>Jeff_Reeves: ERST 15A REST +35 232
>Jim_Burlant: ADDLNNS -DLN +0 208
#note This is ridiculous.  My winning chances have fallen under 30%. Quackle prefers a bunch of plays leaving no vowels that don't even score 20 points.    Sim winner is 5E DAN 15.  No thanks.  Sim says DAN wins 36%, this choice wins 28.
>Jeff_Reeves: ENOTTUY -ENOTT +0 232
#note This is a random quackle rack; I have no idea what his real rack was.
>Jim_Burlant: ?ADENST 14G DENTAlS +69 277
#note Jackpot!  Didn't know the first choice (ASyNDET(A)) and didn't think of DANKEST 14H, the second choice.  Even this choice - which takes a pounding - sims at 67% winning chances.  At least I can turn tiles and draw some decent stuff again, right?
>Jeff_Reeves: BDNO H11 BON.D +27 259
>Jim_Burlant: GILOOUY 5E GOY +24 301
#note 5G YOU wins the sim, but not by a whole lot.  I'm at 62% winning chances now. 
>Jeff_Reeves: ACMP 4D CAMP +39 298
>Jim_Burlant: IIILOOU A10 LOO. +7 308
#note This position defines the word "Helpless".  The pool shows ZEST C2 coming my way and I'm powerless to block it.   I didn't know the back-hook needed to play H1 OLIO, and had I known it I still would have been dead anyway. Jeff told me after the game that he did not have the S when he put CAMP down.  Quackle claims I actually have 37% winning chances here with OLIO; given his next rack I have zero.  The next rack is his actual rack.
