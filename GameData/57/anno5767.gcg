>Jim_Burlant: IINTVYZ 8F IVY +18 18
#note Quackle prefers 8G TIVY.  My concern was that I didn't want him hooking an H or M at G7 and foiling ZIT F6 on the next turn.  This worked out nicely for me.
>Gregg_Speicher: EX 9H EX +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: BIMNTTZ 10F ZIT +38 56
#note Best.
>Gregg_Speicher: HO 7E OH +10 32
>Jim_Burlant: BKMNOQT D5 BONK +21 77
#note Arrrrgh!  Right idea, wrong execution.  6c BONK!  Poor board vision - I spent almopst a minute on this turn - how did I miss that?
>Gregg_Speicher: DER 8A DRE. +27 59
>Jim_Burlant: BEGMQST -BGQ +0 77
#note Quackle prefers that I also toss the M.
>Gregg_Speicher: VW 6C V.W +14 73
>Jim_Burlant: EEIMSTW 11H ITEM +19 96
#note Quackle prefers 11H TEW and 11H TWEE.  This choice comes in 6th.  Bleah.
>Gregg_Speicher: DNU 10J DUN +19 92
>Jim_Burlant: AAEERSW 11D AWA +23 119
#note Gotta know the bingo to play it, which explains why I didn't put down SEAWARE.  But there's no excuse for my missing AWARDEES down the A column.   Maybe I was too annoyed at the AAE draw for it to occur to me to look for a bingo.  This is the best of the non-bingo options.
>Gregg_Speicher: ANNO D11 .NON +8 100
>Jim_Burlant: EEEIIRS M9 EERIE +17 136
#note Best, A6 EIDE sims a close second.  Seriously considered EIDE, but didn't want to kill that line.  
>Gregg_Speicher: Q 12L Q. +22 122
>Jim_Burlant: BFHINSU C13 HUB +28 164
>Gregg_Speicher: CO 15A CO. +21 143
>Jim_Burlant: DFINORS B12 ORD. +24 188
#note Didn't know this spelling of FIORD, only knew it with a J.  If I had known FORDO, it would have been my choice.
>Gregg_Speicher: J 12A J. +17 160
>Jim_Burlant: EFINORS 12I OF +14 202
#note Best.
>Gregg_Speicher: ?ELLSTT N3 TaLLEST +60 220
>Jim_Burlant: EEINRST A1 INSERTE. +80 282
#note Or SINTERED.  This is best, and the duck estimates my winning chances somewhere around 81%.
>Gregg_Speicher: AFY 13G FAY +27 247
>Jim_Burlant: AAAAGLS O9 ALGA +9 291
#note Quackle prefers O3 and O1 AGA.  Perhaps I needed to look at the tile pool a little more closely.  I'm guessing that I saw 6 unplayed A's and forgot to account for the fact that 4 of them were in my rack when I decided this was the most dangerous bingo line to take out.   Whoops.
>Gregg_Speicher: CDINU 3I INDUC. +20 267
>Jim_Burlant: AAIPRRS O1 PAS +25 316
#note Blind to the row 14 plays again.  14J PAIR wins the sim.   I wasn't happy about keeping duplicated R's but a check of the pool shows I was sitting on the last one of them.  So I rationalized this by figuring that he probably wouldn't be to likely to bingo TO the p.
>Gregg_Speicher: EPU K3 .UPE +14 281
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGIRR B2 AIR +14 330
#note Since I didn't see anything to effectively block the row 2 bingos that didn't give him a juicy hook on row 1, I figured I would do what I could to balance the rack and hope he didn't bingo.  This actually wins the sim, with AIR 7I a close second.
>Gregg_Speicher: AEGIIOO H13 .GO +12 293
#note Gregg told me after the game that he felt his only hope was to open something else up and draw into an unblockable bingo.  You can bet I was sure pleased when I saw him make tihs play given my next rack.
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEGIRS 15H .RGAnISE +74 404
#note Heh heh heh...I suck. ;-)   I had figured for sure he was sitting on S? and was utterly shocked to see IS? come out of the bag on that last turn.  My eyes got as wide as saucers when AGO came down.  I think it took maybe 1/2 a second for me to slap this down.
