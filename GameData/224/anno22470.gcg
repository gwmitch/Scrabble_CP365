#note Q lists AEELRS as only 0.4 better, so I'd think x2 is better against a human, who will adjust less than after an x1.
>Heather_McCall: EGO 8F EGO +8 8
>Jackson_Smylie: AELNRST 7C RENTALS +68 68
#note Tough call here. It is hard to tell what she kept with EGO. I was slightly more comfortable playing RENTALS than I might usually because EGO does not suggest a high point leave. I liked RENTALS positionally because it doesn't give up many bingoes right now (I could see her having anything from eeln to enrt, or some S leaves). I didn't like playing with SEGO for that reason - I'd rather a tighter board and RENTALS seemed to work towards that, even if it gives up 8a right now. Quackle puts my play down 1.3

#note Fully missed QUAVE(R), whose equity is far superior to MANQUE's. I knew MANQUE didn't take an S, so I was hoping for her to play it at some point. It's hard to quantify that chance, but I'd think the two are close-ish.

>Jackson_Smylie: AILRSVW 13A VAWS +32 170
#note Weird position, now that I know DEHS. There is VAW, VAWS, and WIVE to consider (mainly). VAWS seems bad, but Heather will often play DISH if she has an I, instead of EDHS. I think only with DEEHIS racks would she play EDHS. VAWS also closes the VAMPS hook (which of course I could use, but more likely Heather plays on fr 25-30. Beacuse of the -SHED combo, it's also likely she has consonants (maybe an Ecc leave, or CCC). Clearly it was the wrong call here, bt it's hard to say. VAW I wasn't a fan  of ifshe's sitting on a nice rack. Q likes WIVE then VAW then ASWIRL.

#note Stupidest play I've ever made. After MANQUES* comes off, and my history of phonying heather successfully, I thought that MANQUEE had a really good shot. If I had actually thought about it, not only is the word kind of ridiculous, but I am only gaining NINE points from FRENETIC, which I saw. Absolutely no reason to phony, even if I think there's a 90% chance it stays on. Maybe Vera telling me about MARQUEE crossed my brain's feeble wires.

#note actual rack. I don't think there are any bingoes that don't give up one in return, but I think PO(S) gets the job done.

>Jackson_Smylie: ACEGRWY D2 YAW. +20 267
#note Ugh anagramming fail. LEGACY is clearly best here. I saw REACT and LAWYER, and felt confident she was sitting on a blank (also because of the time she took for the turns). REACT still does better than YAWN by a bit - I'm not sure.

>Jackson_Smylie: CDEEGHR M8 CH.DER +32 299
#note I considered hedger, egged, chider, urged. Didn't really consider fishes at this point. I wanted to keep an E, and didn't mind EG too much with the G in the tws lane. I wanted to block future bingoes (should I even be worrying about that with a 17 point lead?). Maybe URGED is nicer to keep the beautiful CEH leave. GACHED I didn't know. Q likes EGGED a lot.

>Jackson_Smylie: EGIKLMO J13 GEM +15 341
#note I had mistracked and thought the pool was better than it was... now I realise playing MOG is way better, cause it must outrun everything that is not a big Z play or a bingo (of which there are few). I can kill the hook next turn. Although, that thinking is surely biased by what happened. Blocking OUTFITS now is good unless she hits CUZ or some other big play (ZIBe(T)?). I didn't like playing the obvious KEG because the N's out mak ZING a possibility or other high scoring ING words. the M is a lot harder to wokr with in that position.
