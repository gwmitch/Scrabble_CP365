#note Turn 2 and already my word knowledge or lack thereof reveals itself. 8G J(E)MADAR, a spelling I was not familiar with even though it is the most common one. That is a good play, but not quite as good as the one that I make here.

#note This is the sort of play I attempt to never make, but it seemed valid here in a "secure a win" vs "win by more a tad less of the time" scenario. You can continue reading if you want an elaboration of this concept.

What I mean by this is that I could have sacrificed 4 points and a whole lot of bingo chances for next turn by playing BOG 14I, but on the other hand I basically force Dean to bingo in a particular area of the board that he won't usually be happy to play in (column N) if indeed he has a bingo rack. I also could have been even more aggressive though (I consider my play to be conservative, not aggressive or defensive. I could have played BENTO(S) at 8A for 27, creating a few openings on this board. That play actually prevents many annoying scenarios of loss of board control where either A) Dean gets a huge play at 8A with the Z or the Q and opens up bingo lanes or B) Dean bingos down column E which creates both a continuation of a huge Z/Q play threat at 8A as well as many tiles to bingo through later on. 

So I do think I made a mistake here, but it was done to conserve energy. GOB is the easy play to make. The other two require a plan of action that supercedes "I'm going for a bingo next turn and scoring".

#note I was very happy to see this play come down, as it basically decimates any threat I perceived of losing control over this game's result by closing the whole left side of the board.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEGNTT K9 T..G +10 205
#note I considered many plays here. J10 (JO)TTE(D) and K9 T(AN)GED (those were among the same line of thought of playing bingo defense at the expense of my own leave).

9K G(I)T to soften the blow on some S bingos Dean might have and also set up another lane for myself who has no S on my rack.

And then just K9 T(AN)G, in the same line of thought as last turn, being going for a bingo next turn. Against Dean it would seem this strategy has worked better than my typical strategy of playing defensively or aggressively first, and not making any middling plays. I have lost too many games to this fella playing like that, I think. So I wanted to switch things up.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDDENT 14I BEND +18 223
#note Was hoping he would float an E so I could bingo. This play was incorrect. I misassessed the value of my leave versus the value of keeping DN? instead. Was silly not to consider that. 14I DEBT is a better. It increases my chances of bingoing by over 10% next turn over BEND, and only scores one fewer point, while giving one fewer point back if Dean plays at 15L next turn. You do the math.

#note I saw one bingo and one bingo only this turn, and that was TIDd(L)IER. I didn't know if it was valid or not, so I didn't play it. TRI(L)bIED also fits, but the most embarrassing thing is missing 6I TIDIERs, even though I looked there. I should see that instantly. The other bingo I could play is N1 DRIfTIE(R), but I was not familiar with that word.

#note I've always wanted to play this word. I tried to enter it in the prize category "words pertaining to Justin Trudeau", but no one understands my sense of humour :(

Can you see the bingo I missed here? Wow!

#note Now with the same exact rack as last turn, I see the correct play. No loss then, I guess... Does anyone see any way out of this mess?

>Joshua_Sokol: AEEIRSU 7G U.EA +9 383
#note Is there an alternative? Maybe E4 URAE(I)? It is better to play off 4 tiles here...

#note My heart almost stopped here
>Joshua_Sokol: EIILRSU 5E LIEUS +16 399
#note I saw the pool and I was just praying I wasn't going to have lost this game and draw the W out of the bag. I chickened out of ILEUS because I didn't think it made a difference if I played it or LIEUS, but I actually took away a chunk of my winning chances in doing so. The only other bingo Dean can have is SLOWEST. I didn't even see that as a possibility, but it plays after LIEUS and not after ILEUS. So I basically made a play that doesn't help me at all. I could make any other play instead of LIEUS besides passing my turn and I would have the same winning chances. Yet another play I make this game that accomplishes nothing! I assure you that it won't continue like this! I promise.

#note 4A WASTES is Dean's play here. It's 5 points better than this

#note Whew, dodged a bullet this game. That would have been a phenomenal comeback. I had no business opening this game up for grabs by making mistakes.
