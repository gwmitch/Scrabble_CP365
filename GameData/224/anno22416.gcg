#note Tasha meant to play at 10D here. She announced her score and I was confused as to how it was possible. She drew tiles before I remembered to challenge as I was too busy correctly counting the score for her incorrect play. I tried to challenge, but it was too late. A bit sneaky, but it turned out not to matter.  I need to remember to consider the challenge before considering the score.
>Reid: ?ELNOOR 11B LONE +22 53
#note CORONEL at 11B is #1 (76.54%). ONLOOKER at D6 or DY is #2 and #3 (70.65%, 69.39%). COLORMEN at C5 is #4 (63.3%). I didn't even look for a bingo here. My play is #14 (48.9%). Big mistake here. I was still fuming from the missed challenge last turn.

>Reid: ?AEEORU 12E AUREOlE +62 115
#note #1 play.
>Tasha_Asberry: DDI L10 DID +26 102
#note Tasha profits from the inopportune position of my bingo.
>Reid: DDIILTY 13J IDYL +29 144
#note DIDY at 13I is #3 (62.41%). LYDDITE at K6 is #1 (63.71%). My play is #2 (62.57%). This is a minor mistake at most. I'm okay with my play here. Quackle's choice does get greater turnover.
>Tasha_Asberry: GGLY H11 L.GGY +30 132
>Reid: DINRSTU 15A INDUSTR. +89 233
#note #1 play. Luckily, my brain found this one; I didn't even look for a bingo here.
>Tasha_Asberry: CFHT 11K F.TCH +40 172
>Reid: CEEIIIR 13A ICIER +20 253
#note HIREE at O11 is #1 (87.53%). RICH at O8 is #3 (80.62%). My play is #2 (83.66%). Medium sized mistake here. I didn't think hard enough on this turn. I was too focused on balancing and dumping the I in my rack. I didn't like leaving the triple open. I think the extra points and the positioning justify keeping the extra I here. There aren't that many I left in the bag, so triple I is unlikely. I agree with Quackle.
>Tasha_Asberry: ABS O8 BAS. +27 199
>Reid: AEILNWX 7K XENIA +23 276
#note CALX or CALIX at N11 are top two (92.11, 90.96)%. WEAN at N6 is #3 (89.52%). My play is #13 (87.08%). At the time, I thought this was a good play. I agree with Quackle here. This is a medium size mistake. I didn't even consider the IDYL hook.

>Reid: BFOQSTU 2B F.B +16 427
#note #1 play. I wanted to keep my U and go out on the next turn. I figured FOB would block any likely bingo.
>Tasha_Asberry: IKN 1A KIN +33 280
>Reid: EOOQSTU 3I TOQUES +36 463
#note #1 play.
>Tasha_Asberry: EIRS 5A RISE +14 294
#note ROSHI at J2 is #1. 
>Tasha_Asberry:  (O) +2 296
#note This game was incorrectly scored as 462-297. 10 of my 12 plays were in the top 2. I did miss one bingo and failed to properly challenge Tasha's goof. Overall, I give myself a C+/B- this game. Without those two errors, this could have been one of my better games. Average difference from top win% per turn was 2.5%.
