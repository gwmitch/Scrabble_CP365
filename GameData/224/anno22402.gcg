#note My logic here was this. Since DO Ross has been playing off positive tiles in such a way that makes me think he is keeping well. Therefore I felt I needed to create scoring spots. I am tying the game. I need to be able to unload my random rack. This is why SPRIT(Z)eD has to be correct.

#note I was enraged and confused about Ross' last play. How strong is his leave really? I feel like he has an S, so I don't value blocking one spot and sacrificing a lot of points to do so at all here. So I was stuck with allowing him to bingo if he hits. It isn't looking good unless I can dodge a bingo next turn. But maybe I play OA(T)Y anyway at 10C. I only saw OA(T)H. Yeah, that's probably right, since it does block a few things and scores.
>Ross_Brown: DEELLOR B7 E.ROLLED +72 350
#note But this was enraging! I don't see the merit in fishing an R with RONDEL at the position we were in. Ugh. Maybe the D with FUMED/DREE, cause that scores...
>Joshua_Sokol: AABJTUY 15D .BAYA +30 338
#note I played this to stop instant losses and scoring on his part. If he overlaps ABAYA and scores then I can reoverlap with my J, as only the O and the A go in front of the Y, so I have JOY and JAY automatically. Perhaps this was an overthought position and I should just play BAY A13 or play JUBA D3, or my original plan of A13 TAJ. But the leave was too ugly for me to be fine with TAJ.

>Joshua_Sokol: ACEEJTU A13 TAJ +35 373
#note So enraging that my plan worked out but that I have no play to reoverlap!! I don't know what's right here. I guess D4 JEE to set up AJEE, cause I'm not winning without a bingo? It seemed it was possible if I drew consonants that I would win without a bingo here.
