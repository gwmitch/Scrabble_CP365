#note VIRAL or HILAR at 8D are top 2 (49.51, 48.49)%. RIVAL at 8H is #3 (48.45%). My play is #6 (48.18%). This is a small mistake at most, I like my leave better.

#note #1 play.

>Reid: DDILMOT J6 MOLD +30 75
#note MILD and DOLT are #1 and #3 (51.54, 49.39)%. My play is #2 (50.85%). I disagree with Quackle here, I like me leave better. This mistake is minor.

#note #1 play. I almost got greedy and went for the invalid MASTERER.
>Chris_Tallman: EEW 10D EEW +31 180
>Reid: EIISTXZ E5 ZESTI.. +32 217
#note XI at 14M is #1 (82.08%). ZESTS at C9 is #2 (75.18%). NIX at 8M is #3 (75.17%). I prefer NIX to XI. I like #2 as well. I didn't like using my ess here and Quackle doesn't like my choice either. My play is not in the top 15 for 5 min champ. My play is #21 based on valuations of all plays. This is at least a medium sized mistake.

#note Exchanging GQR, EQR or Q are top 3 here (72.57, 70.70, 70.17)%. I was worried about Chris' bingo with the blank still out and went for a block with an invalid word. I agree with Quackle here, exchanging is likely the best move. This was a big mistake. If valid, my play would be #17 based on valuations of all plays.

#note #1 play here. I had to go for the block now.

#note Chris gets a phoney on me. I guess I was thinking of CORM.

#note LUDS at 10K is #1. My play is #2. SUN at K11 is #3. 
>Reid:  (?AAETTY) +18 431
#note This game was incorrectly scored as 433-283. No missed bingos this game. 10 of my 13 plays were in the top 2. 11 of 13 in the top 6. I did unintentionally play a phoney and let a phoney get past me. Overall, I give myself a C- this game. If not for the phoney business, this could have been one of my best games.
