>JD: ACEIJOT 9C JO +37 51
#note more poor word vision - AJI would be way better than JO here because JO gives back a lot of cheap points to an underlap.
>David_Koenig: ATX 11C TAX +52 102
#note this wouldn't have happened with AJI!!
>JD: ACEEINT D8 C... +10 61
#note extremely questionable fish attempt. tough turn. I didn't like how ACEINT fished on this board, but it's still better than AEEINT. actually the top-simming play is EE at 12E, which I find highly counter-intuitive - it works because there are so many Es left, and precisely because ACEINT is not a strong fishing leave. a less fishy alternative is IODATE through ODA. just fishing an E is fine too. any of these are way better than my decision.
>David_Koenig: EEGO 9I OGEE +12 114
>JD: ABEEINT 8L BEAT +34 95
#note Q likes BEIN keeping AET by a few points - harder to overlap and supposedly more prone to bingoing. I should probably dump the I since none have been played yet, whereas 3 As are already on the board.
>David_Koenig: DIQ N7 Q.ID +18 132
>JD: EINPRUY 10I PUNY +34 129
#note as always happens against dave, I was being heavily pressured on time, so it was nice to have an easy play to make for a turn.
>David_Koenig: EST 12D SET +32 164
>JD: ?EEEIRW 11J EE +14 143
#note I liked setting up the ENEW hook for next turn, hopefully letting me continue to score if I don't bingo.

>JD: ?EEFIRW H12 F.RE +33 176
#note the F is a much better bingo tile than the W, should really play WORE here. another option is WE at 12H setting up WOF, but then after that it would be a race to the S. I also thought he might be holding the Z here (in fact, he had it on every rack from now until the end of the game) so I really wanted to play something on column H.
>David_Koenig: CNRU 14F CU.N +27 213
>JD: ?AEINSW O6 WI. +17 193
#note I need to bingo as fast as I can, and the fastest way to ensure that seemed to be setting up new lanes for myself. I can also just rely on keeping up on score, playing WAIN, but it seemed like that would just leave me down a tempo for the foreseeable future.
>David_Koenig: AEIMRTZ O10 IMARET +30 243
#note as mentioned, his last tile was the Z.
>JD: ?AENOSS 15E rES.ASON +71 264
>David_Koenig: HIZ N14 HI +22 265
#note he was hoping to draw some biggish Z play at N12, but drew no vowels except Is.
>JD: ABGILLT M11 BLIT +18 282
>David_Koenig: AIKL 12L I.K. +16 281
>JD: AAEGLOR 14K LA... +12 294
#note I really didn't want to open anything, but GORA at E4 is a great opening try, with only one A and one U remaining to go on column D, and also saving myself the AGORA front hook. It also turns over 2 more tiles with a blank unseen. I agree that GORA is probably better than my choice.
>David_Koenig: FOR 7J FRO +15 296
>JD: AEGNNOR 6G GENOA +17 311
#note an important and challenging play. I thought GENOA seemed ideal, because it doesn't open much for Dave and turns over 5 tiles in search of the blank, but keeping a vowel might be better - Q suggests RENO at 6G. Another highly volatile option is RANGER at K2, setting up the last O for ORANGER, but I think that Dave should be able to figure out how to score and block simultaneously from there. Finally, GONNA at E3 keeps a better leave than GENOA, but at the cost of potentially opening more plays. I like my play OK even though it doesn't sim great - RENO might be stronger because it doesn't open the scoring spot at 5K.
>David_Koenig: ERSTV 5K VERST +35 331
#note things looked very bad after this play - I didn't pull in any of the good letters, and now he's in the lead.
>JD: ADINNRU L4 N. +4 315
#note quackle doesn't find a win, but I figured that all I could do at this point was trying to draw UNAIRED and hope he mistracks or something...
>David_Koenig: EILPRYZ H4 ZE. +22 353
#note unbelievably, Dave left the blank in the bag on his last turn, and is now guaranteed to lose! he didn't see column E and so thought his block was good enough.
>JD: ?ADINRU E1 cANDIRU +67 382
#note fortunately my CSW study was enough to let me find the gamewinner. not my finest played game, but also an extremely challenging defensive struggle in which I persisted to come out on top.
