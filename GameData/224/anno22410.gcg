#note I have an abysmal challenge record against Lloyd. His word knowledge is tremendous. So given that I didn't know for sure, I chickened out of BIRDIED. Instead, FPS (Fancy Play Syndrome) kicked in. I calculated that it was unlikely that he kept an R, since 2/6 were already seen, and so if he did bingo, it would most likely be hooking B(R)IE and giving me multiple lanes to work with with my maximum bingo potential. And if he did not hit his fish exchange, I would be in even better shape.

#note ouch. PRIED is better than this, I didn't even hesitate between the two which is normal for an overanalytical person like me. PRIED is better since more bingos of mine that I could draw end in ED than in E.

#note AECEDIA is no good, but AECIDIA is. That is my play at M3.

#note Perhaps I should just play 15D CASED and keep RS. I preferred this position though.

>Joshua_Sokol: BINORST 4D BRO +24 247
#note My far my worst miss of the tournament. I stared at BINOORT for a while. One of the words I've always had a tough time finding.

>Joshua_Sokol: INOPRST O2 .IP +25 272
#note Horrible move. NORST just plain sucks here. I should play (S)ON if I am still trying to leave QUALMS open.
>Lloyd_Mills: EENOT A1 TO.NEE +30 317
>Joshua_Sokol: INNOOST B6 NOTIONS +65 337
#note Perfect, as long as he hasn't drawn both blanks, I should be in good shape here. The pool is garbage otherwise.
>Lloyd_Mills: ??AFRTT 15D FAsTeR +49 366
#note Lloyd wasn't 100% on FRITTAT(A) apparently. This was good enough. Sick ?? draw on his part just when he needed them. All of the S's in the world couldn't help me this game, I was a goner from turn 2. By far my sloppiest game of the tournament.
