#note spent a long time on this rack, never seen AHEMERAL# previously. this was the morning after Blue Thorogood's tribute to Mikki Nicholson so it was a fitting time for HAEREMAI to come down.

#note looking for something better, liked the defensive board shape - I think I'm OK with passing up the extra points for URINATOR, since this allows me to contain the volatility of the board much better.

#note I really hated the idea of playing ROQUE here. Quackle thinks it's better by a few points, but it seems very unlikely to me that he wouldn't have some play there with 5 hook letters available. I don't think this is a risk I need to take.

>JD: ABEHKOU 1F HABU +31 343
#note I liked that this saved the K for 7G, and also blocks the big bingo lane from the R. but Q says it's worth the extra 6 points for HAKU#, which seems reasonable.

#note under time pressure didn't write this rack down - I know I didn't have FENCEROW available because I was looking for it as a possibility. this rack is just a guess.

#note Quackle doesn't turn up my play, which I feel confident must be my best option. Even if I don't draw a vowel, it will be challenging for Adam to block all of my big plays and find a win. if I do draw a vowel then I have so many potential plays that he probably won't be able to block all of them. The best play that Quackle comes up with is HAEREMAIS/CONS, which has good winning chances and beats his actual rack, but I think my play is superior.

#note Adam had 15 minutes on his clock and basically used all of them. No play wins, but he can scrounge 4 extra spread points by playing from the S instead with SNIP leaving DOWD to go out next turn, which neither of us thought of. That's an 8-point loss. I think his best try was playing DOP at I13, or maybe DOD, which force me to find more complicated plays. DOP is wrong against a computer because he only leaves one out-spot which I can block (SPOD sets up WIND(OW) so I can't try a similar ploy), but I had used almost all my clock and wouldn't have chanced it anyway. After DOP I was planning on playing SPRAG, which is enough to win by 3. DOD has little chance of working also because I had seen FUB at B2, which will let me go out in two before he can go out.

#note one of my best wins of the tournament! I played a strong game and found the clinching play in the pre-endgame.
