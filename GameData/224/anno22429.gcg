#note yikes! I'm already down over 100 and in need of a bingo lane, so I didn't just take the points for JIZ. can always fish with MIZ next turn if I need to, which would create a much easier bingo lane to hit.
>Patrick_Gitonga: ?EFILOT 13E LOFTIEr +75 204
#note FILEMOT would've been 89
>JD: AABIMNS I5 BAI.A +35 79
#note I'm down huge already, and in need of as much volatility as I can generate. I felt that this was a great play in that regard, but I missed a competitor play that may be even better - BHAJI at 10G, sacrificing 11 points to create a great bingo lane on column L. They're both good plays but I think BHAJI may be a tad better by creating an immediate high-scoring bingo lane that I can hit.
>Patrick_Gitonga: ORVW J3 VROW +35 239
>JD: AAEMNSX 14E AXE +58 137
#note EXAM kills AXE on a sim, but EXAM doesn't create any new attacking spots (in fact, it blocks the V for bingos). AXE looks bad, but if he doesn't have an O or Y, I at least guarantee myself one scoring spot on row 15, and if he takes 15A I might get to bingo hooking FEM.
>Patrick_Gitonga: DEGU 15G DEGU +25 264
>Patrick_Gitonga: AHIU (challenge) +5 269
#note sacrificing 5 points to block. I challenged because I wasn't absolutely sure.
>JD: AEKMNRS H1 NERKA +47 184
#note again, I need to create bingo lanes since he will otherwise keep things as tight as possible, and this creates some really good lanes for 8s that could be tough for him to block
>Patrick_Gitonga: AHIU 10B HUIA +19 288
>JD: ALMMRSU 15A LARUM +29 213
#note major miss, I was thinking of MARABOU but must have forgotten that it was good without the T on the end! there are 4 Ts left so it even sets up a great new bingo lane that I could hit.
>Patrick_Gitonga: AEL I1 ALE +15 303
>JD: AFMRRST K6 ARF +12 225
#note quite desperate on this play and I had burned a lot of time, only about 6 minutes left. missed FRAS at K8 which is far superior, scoring extra points and immediately creating a dangerous new bingo lane. at least this play offered the possibility of opening the board on next turn.
>Patrick_Gitonga: EE G2 EE +14 317
#note he was thinking about trying to block the U, but thought twice, mercifully for me
>JD: EIMNRST C4 TERMIN.S +64 289
#note I have a chance!
>Patrick_Gitonga: EORTV D1 VOTER +30 347
>JD: ACDNOSY 8K .ANCY +42 331
#note now things are really winde open and I truly have a chance. a block on his part for too few points leaves me with the prospect of outscoring him to win.
>Patrick_Gitonga: DEIOTUW E4 WEID +28 375
#note he put down OUTWIN and then picked it up to play WEID...which means that he had WIDEOUT playable at E2 for 89 points!! thank goodness he missed the spot. I think OUTWIN is likely better since it blocks so many more bingos, but he must've been wanting to restrict my scores on row 8.
>JD: CDGNNOS 2A COD.N +16 347
#note he leaves me in a tough spot after blocking COIGN, which was my plan. fortunately, I found this play which leaves me with a real chance of pulling off a win - 3 Is are remaining, which can leave me with a potent -INGS leave, and even an unblockable bingo if I draw it to the C. however, he has just shown me that he already has at least one T, which makes this play a bit weaker than it would've been otherwise.
>Patrick_Gitonga: GGIINNOSTY M3 OUTDO.E +20 395
#note I believe patrick later said that his final tile was an I. from patrick's perspective, he said he was blocking the possibility of STONYING on column M and wasn't worried about anywhere else. given that he had just drawn the last E, this is a good read on his part - he blocks a lot of -ING and -INGS bingos column M. However there are still plays he loses to like a few C bingos on column A and STONYING on column O, but he can do nothing about those, and playing 1 or 2 tiles won't helpt.  One more idea is DOUCET# at N5, which prevents the STONNING#/STONYING# rack from bingo, but DOUCET fails to block NOINTING# which OUTDONE does block successfully.
>JD: GGINOSY A2 .OSYING +42 389
#note the bag after I played CODON was evidently GIINOTY, so the tiles were there to draw the game-winning bingo - just didn't work out this time. given his last play of OUTDONE and the actual bag, my winning chances were 4/35.
>Patrick_Gitonga: IINT N2 INTI +14 409
>Patrick_Gitonga:  (G) +4 413
#note I didn't pull out the win, but this was one of my best-played games of the tournament, I think. I at least created a way to steal the game on the final turn.
