>Dan_Sandu: ADEEMNX -ADEEMN +0 0
>JD: ABIRTUZ 8G BIZ +28 28
#note Q slightly prefers BIZ shifted over to F8, which is intriguing - I guess the comebacks after BIZ if he doesn't have an A or an O to play under the Z?
>Dan_Sandu: CEUV J5 CUVE +26 26
>Dan_Sandu: CEUV --  -26 0
>JD: AAPRTUY 9E PAY +23 51
#note lots of options. maybe ATAP to block the easy BIZE hook? Q also likes PUY at 10E which sets up less of a hotspot.

#note he thought of NATURIST but didn't trust it being good.
>JD: BCEEIOS D12 BICE +29 194
#note completely missed the spot for GOV at D11 on this turn. ROBE is a much stronger play, bingoing almost 50%!

>Dan_Sandu: ADEINST K8 STAINED +82 304
>JD: AFILNOO L11 FOLIO +32 397
#note most important turn of the game so far. I considered FOLIO, ALIF at 1L and ALOOF at A1. in the end I didn't want to place a letter at 1A for fear of a big bingo play on row 1. I also liked that FOLIO blocks a lot of scoring plays on column J.
>Dan_Sandu: GOW 1M WOG +29 333
>JD: AAKLNTW A1 TALAK +37 434
#note I wasn't sure that TWANK# was good, so TALAK# instead. KALIAN at H1 could be safer, making it tougher for Dan to bingo.
>Dan_Sandu: GHO 8A GO.H +36 369
>JD: EENNSWY G13 WYE +29 463
#note fortunate to draw the S on my last draw, now I have much less to worry about.
>Dan_Sandu: F 13C F.. +14 383
>JD: ENNOPRS H1 ORP.N +29 492
#note correct is to play ORPINS to leave ENTRUSTING, which I forgot about as a possibility under lack of time.
