#note stupid example of letting ego get in the way. 

Zev was joking how he was gonna have to speed up to play me cause I always play very quickly, especially against him. This of course goes straight to my head so when seeing this rack I play in about 3 seconds, not bothering to consider any options. Had I remained calm and level headed, I certainly would have not found the best play of POOJA (didn't know the word), but would have come up with JAUP, which is far superior to exchanging.

Always remain calm.

#note MUDFLAPS is awesome! I wasn't entirely sure of FAULDS, and FUD seemed close if not better.

#note SCOLIOMA is also worth noting.

>Jackson_Smylie: CENNOST N4 CONSENT +73 199
#note This is when I knew I was going to win the game. I didn't know CON(C)ENTS, which seems like it might be best. I saw CONNECTS, CONNOTES, CONTENTS, CONSENT. I liked taking away the OGIVES hook now, but CONSENT gives up the most of any play. it seems fine.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?EHKMSX 14J HEX +37 236
#note Bad thinking here - KEX seems fine because HMS does so well in the 3 scoring spots available. I will be ensured a great score, whereas HEX lets Zev take a spot and I might not be left with one. KM is must less flexible than HM. I laid down HEX then realized my mistake, but didn't want to take it back at that point. Although maybe it doesn't matter, cause the H works as well with any of the spots.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?AAGKMS 13K MAG +27 263
#note MASK is the safe play that I probably should have taken. I loved MAG and the possiblity of a 40-50 point play for me next turn. No need to risk it though.

>Jackson_Smylie: ?EELNQS 9F Q. +11 309
#note Didn't even consider QuEEN. Zev was nearing time trouble so I don't regret making a snap decision, but QuEEN might be better. There aren't a lot of ways to score after the H1 spot it taken.

#note UNBE bingoes for me a ton more, but might lead to more disaster scenarios. Even though the board isn't great right now, I don't see myself not bingoing at some point in this game. I would worry about Zev bingoing and not giving me anything back to work with, or me bingoing and Zev hitting a bit play. 
>Zev_Kaufman: EJO F2 JOE +28 339
>Jackson_Smylie: ?BEENOS 14J ...ONE +35 365
#note I felt good about making this play. there are a lot of potential comebacks, but the main threats, the Y and Z, aren't as likely to be hit. Zev didn't have an L or a Y last turn, because he would have played JOLE or JOEY. So only REZ is a problam. 
>Zev_Kaufman: LZ O13 L.Z +36 375
>Jackson_Smylie: ?ABEIRS 5A RABIES.s +79 444
#note Zev was shuffling with LEZ for a while, which was confusing to me. I figured he must have a few vowels to work with and was struggling to find a Z play at H1. I really was not sure RABIESES was best, but was alright with minimizing my chance of fucking up and taking the chance that he doesn't have a bingo. The fact that Q says RABIEs(E)S is 5% better than RABIES(E)s makes me distrust the championship player results. Q likes QI best, at around 92%. RABIESES doesn't let him improve his rack any more, so I just stand the risk of him bingoing now or not at all. Part of my reason for choosing this was certainly because it was harder for me to grasp a play like RIN or BIN or QI and its win%. It's much easier to grasp RABIESES in the bingo = lose scenario.
