#note This was more tricky than one would think. The X is going to be huge this game, but the spot I am creating for it is humongous. NOYAUX! I hoped he would A) not know/spot it or B) obviously that I would draw the X myself. How big is the risk, in your opinion? Should I have played something slightly worse for my sake to prevent something huge?

#note Normally ENT is a better leave than ENOT all around, but this time, it was debatable. I was torn between this and C3 P(R)OOF and in the end, I decided that there were more than enough scoring spots on the board, and creating a huge J-bomb is just... too much. :). Now, if he has the X and misses NOYAUX, I'm not in such bad shape.

#note I did not want or need that blank. Hopefully Dean will find a way to make this game competitive, since my luck was attempting to prevent either of us from having fun.

>Joshua_Sokol: DDLNOST 1A ODS +18 393
#note In the absence of palatable options, I decided to secure the win here. Dean had just played the X, so not more risk there, and the only way it seems he could get back in this game would be with a triple-triple.

>Joshua_Sokol: ADGITTW 13G WAG +29 440
#note Almost nailed this one. 14D DAWT is the play here. I was going for one of those two S's and the E, hoping that I could add to my spread if perchance I could bingo out.
>Dean_Porporo: ACEGIIS 14D SICE +29 317
#note Not supposed to give me that triple there. The best endgame begins with the out this leaves Dean next turn.
>Joshua_Sokol: DIKRSTT 15G SKIRT +34 474
#note This is wrong. Firstly DISK is one more point and secondly DISK sets up a stealthy out with H6 (F)R(I)TT. If I play SKIRT, Dean can block my only out with AG(E) 11K.
>Dean_Porporo: AGI A13 .AG +23 340
#note His out is A5 GAI(JIN)!
