#note I dithered between this and QUOIF, but FOU 7H sims slightly ahead of either. (-1)
>Evans: OWY K11 YOW +30 116
>Carl: AEEFGTU 14J FEAGUE +46 78
#note My Collins knowledge is pretty weak. I've studied a fair number of words, but not as rigorously as I've studied TWL. FEAGUE seemed vaguely familiar, and after several minutes I decided I couldn't have just made it up. The good thing about Collins is that the exotic words tend to stick out more.
>Evans: ?IMOSSZ O8 ISOZyM.S +222 338
#note I challenge mostly because it's hopeless if I don't. I'll win the game so seldom after ISOZYMES that 99% sure isn't enough.
>Carl: ?DDEEET 15E DElETED +91 169
#note I didn't know DEEDEsT# or STEEDED#. (-4)
>Evans: IIORV E10 VIROI. +20 358
>Carl: AFGIJNR 10N J. +25 194
#note Better than JAGIR# 12A because I need multiple miracles to come back, and JAGIR# offers an easy scoring opportunity for Evans, decreasing volatility.

#note This was pretty cool! I slapped it down immediately, knowing it wasn't good in TWL, but it turns out to be acceptable in Collins! Thing is, I knew and saw LOOKIST on the previous turn but didn't bother to notice that it now plays at C8. Dave pointed it out after the game.
