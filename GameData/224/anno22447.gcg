#note key play of the game! and a fascinating decision - do I hold the X or not? if I play at the top-left, do I play OCHE? I spent about 10-15 minutes on this play with dave wiegand and peter armstrong, and there was no consensus. my logic was that by saving EIX, I could easily draw EXINE on row 15 for a 60-point play. however, with the spot at 10B available, that shouldn't be such a consideration, and OCHE is probably better than OCH. From there, do I choose OX/OXO first, or take OCH? the advantage of OXO is that I may end up bingoing more often next turn. the disadvantage is that he may score a lot of points at A1 if I don't play there, and if I don't bingo I may score a lot less than I would've with OCH, whereas the OCHE/OX sequence is probably sufficient to beat him even if he bingos. tough choice!

#note his actual rack - he should probably play something fishier than this, because he surely has to bingo to win, and it's more likely to happen given a leave of ADILN than with AN.
