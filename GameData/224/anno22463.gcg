>Sid: BCEHIPR 8D BIRCH +30 30
#note No to CERIPH/CIPHER. BIRCH here because I remembered an anno where Gibson opened with BIRCH at this spot.

>Sid: DEEGIOP F6 PE.OGI +19 49
#note I saw PIGGED, but this was masterfully suffocating, in my eyes. Even the equity ducky thinks this is only a point worse.

#note Eschewed the 74 pointers here. But SLATIEST! A small mistake that got me burned BADLY.

>Sid: CENNOWY L4 WYN +32 277
#note I passed up WENNY because I thought Chris would never block the floating E, and I can wait a turn for giving him a million points on a board bereft of scoring opportunities.

#note I can't blame myself for this try; I had been playing fairly okay up to this point but I'm getting destroyed. the play here is OVARY, which sets up the C and leaves column J open, but Chris had the blank here so I pretty much never win.
