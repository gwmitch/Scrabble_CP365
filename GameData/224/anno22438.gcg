#note difficult play, but missed the cool extension! knew the word too, since john infamously played it to win the baltimore big-stakes tournament when it wasn't valid in TWL.

#note I wanted to keep FACE extensions and row 2 open, so no WEDEL here.

#note good lord, I cannot believe how many phonies I played this tournament. this one is so much better than any real play I have that it's almost worth trying, and yet also still dreadful.

>Moizullah_Baig: AO (challenge) +5 326
#note should know my 5s!
>JD: ADEGNOT N9 .ONGED +42 355
#note key move, blocks a lot of potential 8s and gives me some hope of outrunning him if he draws the blank, or drawing it myself with turnover.
>Moizullah_Baig: AO C13 O.A +10 336
>JD: ADGHRST 15A HA.RS +44 399
#note the obvious choice is GARTH, but after GARTH, if moizullah bingos on column B and draws an out play, I will likely lose. HAARS forces him to have a 4-tile rack if he bingos, and therefore makes it tougher for him to go out. HAARS scores more, increasing my chances of out running moizullah, and also blocks the most dangerous lane on row 15, and the H will be tough to bingo to. difficult choice!

#note we were both down to not much time, so I needed a quick response. I liked dropping the D here because I can draw QUITED#/QUOTED for spread. I can lose to MONTEITH, but he has to find it first anyway under heavy time pressure.
>Moizullah_Baig: ?AEINOT B7 ATONIEs +59 417
#note he ran out of time and went for the bingo instead of fishing again. Q suggests ATONIES wins 2 out of 8, but ELATION/ENATION wins an extra endgame because putting the T at B8 lets me play QUEST if the O is in the bag, whereas after ELATION and drawing the O he wins. if he hadn't bingoed I probably would play QUOTES at B8 to block everything anyway, so he had to go for it.

#note great game, one of my most competitive of the entire tournament, against one of the young Pakistani cohort! Excited to see where Moizullah takes his game in the next few years, he showed a lot of heart.
