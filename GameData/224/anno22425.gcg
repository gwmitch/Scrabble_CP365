>JD: ADEIIUY -AIIUY +0 0
#note what an adversary to be selected by random draw! Sim suggests that an exchange is a tad better than ADIEU.
>Nigel_Richards: ?BINOOU H7 NIOBOUs +68 68
>JD: AADEINN I7 ANI +13 13
#note I didn't spot DAINE# here for 24 at G9, but ANI is only a couple of points worse because it bingos twice as often.

#note good to finally have an easier move!

>JD: CDEEOOX B6 COOEED +30 188
#note I liked setting up the possibility of XI or TAX, but there are no excellent X spots on this board so quackle suggests playing it now for CODEX for 37.

>JD: DEGIMRX C7 XI +39 227
#note q sez that I am now just over 50% to win

#note I held this word for a minute. it's good in TWL!
>JD: ?DEGGMR J6 EGG +15 242
#note with the blank in hand and a big deficit, I felt like it was right to leave the triple lane open. quackle likes the new GREGED#, which definitely looks better than EGG. Maybe not such a great choice on my part, but I was constrained by time already.

>JD: CEGHIMZ 1A ZIG. +48 380
#note really lucky after my bingo to draw most of the remaining good scoring tiles - the Q doesn't score very well so I have a nice chance from here.
>Nigel_Richards: AQT 4J Q.AT +26 386
#note Nigel played very fast on this turn...
>JD: ACEHLMR N3 MERC +28 408
#note happy to find an 8/8 win on this play, and not only that but a play with better spread than any Quackle play! Quackle finds huge scoring plays like REACH or REECH on 3C, which I didn't look at because I was particularly concerned with potential huge plays on column N. My play works because every play draws me an out-play, and many of them on column O are unblockable! I didn't have a lot of time on my clock so I liked making a play that simplified my endgame selections.
>Nigel_Richards: AEIKRTU G3 TRAIK +29 415
#note to me, Nigel made an error here! TAKI at 9K and TRAIK are technically even, but TAKI forces me to find an out through the T with my rack of AEHL, which I wouldn't have seen because both are CSW (ETHAL# and THALE#). Just making a scoring play of HAE at O6 is enough to win, but TAKI at least would've made me sweat a little more.
>JD: AEHL O6 HALE +28 436
#note woot!
