>JD: AFGNRRY 7A FRY +22 22
#note quackle doesn't like this placement of FRY much. I give back a ton of extra points without gaining anything in particular in return. I was lucky that he couldn't do anything with the opening here.

>JD: AINOSSU M4 SUASION +63 239
#note I wanted to set up the S hook on my bingo because I knew I'd still be down about 40 after his next play, so I need another bingo to actually get ahead. hence no SANIOUS.
>Mark_Nyman: AAEORST 11I AEROSAT +72 313
>JD: EILMOTU 10J MUO. +26 265
#note he's just blocked MOULINET unfortunately. there are lots of different reasonable plays, I like MUON over MOUSE because it makes me a lot more likely to hit a triple-triple that can really give me a good chance of winning.
>Mark_Nyman: CNOO O8 CON.O +24 337
>JD: EEILTTW 9C WITE +36 301
#note I really liked WITE instead of WET on this play because it sets up ZONE/ZO - being down as I am, I need the volatility.
>Mark_Nyman: EHN 12J HEN +29 366
>JD: BEEJLNT 1J BE.ENT +33 334
#note didn't want to play JEON which blocks ZONE and the last bingo lane. BEWENT digs into the bag in search of the Z. Playing the J is going to be a big problem, which is the main downside of this move. the two reasonable solutions I see are BEJANT at 6J and AJEE at N11. BEJANT keeps a generally better leave, whereas AJEE makes a ZO draw lass likely, but also opens a valuable new bingo lane that will be difficult to block. on review, I like AJEE - when else will I be able to score so many points to create a new bingo lane?
>Mark_Nyman: OZ 6F ZO +67 433
>JD: EEIJLLT D8 ..LLE +14 348
#note sadly I was already out of time and missed better options. AJEE at N11 is still totally reasonable, setting up a vital bingo lane after I blocked my own with BEWENT,
>Mark_Nyman: IQ 8L Q. +21 454
>JD: EIJORTV A1 JO +31 379
#note it's not looking good no matter what I do, but EORTV supposedly bingos much more often than EIRTV in this position.

>Mark_Nyman: AD 10D .AD +33 492
>JD: AEIRRTV 13D TAIVER +24 403
#note terrible play! sets up big score for him. VAIRE at the top looks best.

#note not a great game following a big win against adam logan. Played perfectly fine until the end when I hemorrhaged spread for no region.
