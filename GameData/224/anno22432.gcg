>JD: DINNOTZ 8G DITZ +28 28
#note wasn't really sure on the right opening. Q suggests ZIN as the play that gives me the best bingo chances next turn, by 2 pts
>Lewis_Mackay: EGORSTY H3 OYSTR.GE +66 66
>JD: AEELNNO J8 .ONE +15 43
#note already at a deficit, I wanted to catch up as fast as I could. Q finds this play reasonable.
>Lewis_Mackay: EIORU 12H OURIE +26 92
>JD: AEEHLNR 6E LEA.HERN +65 108
>Lewis_Mackay: OUUV E3 VOU.U +16 108
>JD: BEEEIPQ 7B PIQ.E +19 127
#note hard to know when to play the Q sometimes, but in this case it opens up some chance of me bingoing next turn if I play it now.
>Lewis_Mackay: HIJMMNO -HIJMM +0 108
#note fortunate that lewis has spent 3 turns drawing absolute garbage
>JD: BEEILNO 8A BENI +39 166
#note another lucky draw, unlikely to be able to score at this spot
>Lewis_Mackay: ?ABEFLO 13B BEeFALO +76 184
>JD: DDELOST 14H TODDLES +79 245
#note a dangerous play, but I obviously must make it
>Lewis_Mackay: AKW G2 AWK +32 216
#note the same tiles go on row 9, but I suppose lewis felt the urgency to open counterplay given that I lucked out and he doesn't have an S on this turn.
>JD: DEINRUV 1D VENDU +51 296
>Lewis_Mackay: AGIILW L1 WAILI.G +30 246
>JD: CIIJRTT F12 T.J +26 322
#note lucky to draw a simple play to cut out the S spot, and put me in great shape to win.
>Lewis_Mackay: APRY K5 P.AY +47 293
>JD: CIIORST 15L OTIC +28 350
>Lewis_Mackay: ?AETX 11J .XEAT +44 337
#note he already had the ?S on this turn and sacrifice a few points to open the spot...
>JD: IINNORS 1L .INO +21 371
#note devastatingly for me, I had the S here, but I really didn't think that EXEAT took the S (it's the latin subjunctive!), and I can't really take a chance on playing there with the score so close, nor can I block for the same reason!! my lack of CSW study and experience costs me a game on the spot, and indirectly propels Lewis to the final. If I knew it took the S I would've played RONINS here. With his actual rack, Lewis still has a chance of winning by fishing, but surely my chances of victory are higher with a block.
>Lewis_Mackay: ?AFGMRS O5 FoGRAMS +109 446
#note I challenged both plays. he actually has MISGRAFT also which beats me anyway if EXEATS wasn't good.
>JD: AAINRRS 9B ANSA +26 397
#note lewis could still have won by bingoing through the IN or to the E, so RONINS wouldn't have gotten me all the way home, but I certainly missed a golden chance. also, ISNA here is 3 more points.
>Lewis_Mackay: CEHM 4A CHEM. +30 476
#note CHEM is an extra point.
>Lewis_Mackay:  (IRR) +6 482
