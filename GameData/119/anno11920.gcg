#note this was a tough choice. i thought it was really likely for DUTY to be there next turn for 50, so i didn't put the Y on. if it wasn't for the damn Q this would probably be more obvious. (-3.5)

#note i wanted to catch up i guess. 6B BE doesn't seem that good to me, but i bingo 73% of the time after it. :/ (-4)

#note quackle likes COIFS K10 best for scoring. FOE is a tiny bit better by win % though. i guess i have to get really lucky and hope he misses AAE

#note no such luck
>cesar: ?CILNST K11 T.CS +27 382
#note i really wanted to try LICITS*. it's probably good in collins. quackle says i will win the most with 10H LECTIN or K9 LICIT. i like LECTIN because it leaves one in the bag, which was my reasoning for LICITS, but i'm never gonna score enough with it. anyone see anything awesome?
