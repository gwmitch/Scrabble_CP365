#note It's understandable that Joel didn't want to play any of the sevens here as they all expose triple lines.  However, UNAGREED was a relatively safe way to bingo that scored eight more.

#note STEAPSIN looks more circumspect, although this actually worked out well for him since my best play was elsewhere.  SPETSNAZ# is not worth the point sacrifice, but wow, what a word!
>Dave_Koenig: FINORTY F1 INTROFY +78 436
#note Eight of the first sixteen plays have been bingos.

#note I thought a while and decided I had to do this.  Quackle simulations agree that it gives me the best chance, thought I am *not* the favorite here.  JO for 41 is tempting, leaving one in the bag, but the problem is that the tile bag is so rich for him that he is very likely to bingo, with or without the blank, on the C column or through the T on row 3. (e.g., EMANATED)  This is the only way I can score enough and block bingo lines, but the problem is that it is likely to get hit hard right back on column D. (BEAM D1 at the very least.)  I have to hope that the damage isn't too bad and that I draw well enough to go out faster than he does.
>Joel_Wapnick: AAADEMN D2 MAENAD +41 479
#note Ouch!  I knew he was bound to hit something there, but I didn't think it would be that bad.  Now I've got B and H on my rack, and if I don't go out, I lose.  He's got KA for 16 or ZA for 11 as an out play.  What do you do?
>Dave_Koenig: ?BEHI 3H BHI.t.E +15 482
#note The only way to win.  Joel did not see it until I played it and thought he had a won game.
