>JD: EFHNTTZ 8G FEZ +30 30
#note FEZ is rather defensive and sims better than you might expect, but I would take THEFT had I seen it.
>Lou_Cornelis: EKN 9F KEN +16 16
>JD: HIMNTTU 10D THIN +23 53
#note part of me wanted to play HUTMENT, but such plays usually don't pay off after a tight opening. UNIT wins the sim by 2 points over THIN - THIN puts the H next to the 2WS and therefore gives up more points. Also, getting rid of the U is nice.

>Lou_Cornelis: ?CIILOS 11G SOLICIt +73 111
>JD: AEIIMNT M5 INTIMA.E +63 134
#note intimate takes a lot of hooks...
>Lou_Cornelis: DERWY 13I WRYED +54 165
#note this is the play that changed the complexion of the game. I held for about three minutes, uncertain about both words. I felt better about the 9, but I thought WRYED looked bad. But for whatever reason I eventually let it go. An unfortunate error.
>JD: BELNPRR 8L B.RL +27 161
#note I would expect BIRL and PIRN to sim about even, but for some reason the BELR leave does significantly worse on this board.
>Lou_Cornelis: AUV L4 VAU +16 181
>JD: EENNOPR L10 P.N. +20 181
#note this is my weakest play of the tournament so far other than not challenging WRYED*. I was scared of opening things up on a tight board, but OPEN is just too many points, and doesn't really give up a great spot anyway
>Lou_Cornelis: AILNOST O4 STAL.ION +59 240
#note in this case OPEN would've given up ANTLIONS, so I was in a good deal of trouble.
>JD: EENORRT D12 OE +14 195
#note sadly, I did something here I don't think I've ever done - I misread my rack. I thought I had EEENORT, but given my next rack I must have had EENORRT instead. with my actual rack OR or RHO would be the best play. I had slept terribly and was really starting to feel it at this point.
>Lou_Cornelis: DGO C11 GOD +22 262
>JD: EEGNRRT I4 NERT. +15 210
#note it's not going to win any sims, but I think my play is ok here given my need to open the board. the only play I see that I think would be better is EGER at N2, which I saw and passed up. I chose NERTZ because it seemed like the best chance I would get to open that region of the board.
>Lou_Cornelis: ALTTW 5D WATTL. +18 280
>JD: EEEGORV 14G EVE +11 221
#note I didn't look at much else after seeing this move. REVEL at H1 is definitely an option - with the X spot at J10 still lurking and other power tiles, I may be able to chase him down after he blocks on row 2. that said, I quite like my play here too. in all likelihood, I will need to create a good lane at some point, and this looks like the best chance I will get.

#note that's the game.

>JD: AD 14K AD +16 377
>JD:  (AEIS) +8 385
#note I clearly made too many mistakes to deserve to win this game. I think that if I had slept better the night before, I may have avoided some of them. That said, I am proud that I came up with a way at the end to at least make the game competitive. Now 1-2 +41
