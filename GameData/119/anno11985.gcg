#note Here Adam opted for his play over 3B ME(N)INX, sacrificing 6 points to keep the X with more than one hotspot. Unfortunately for me, his play blocked my bingo on the next turn. :-(
>deen: CDENORW 7L OWED +30 114
#note Nowhere for CROWNED/DECROWN, and DECROWN(s) has now been blocked.

>deen: ACINRRU F2 CUR +14 128
#note Not a great play here. 3C I(N)CUR 28 or 2B UR(E)IC 26 were both much better and findable. Nerves and/or fatigue...I was happy with my leave, but it's not worth 10+ points to sacrifice.
>adam_logan: AEFILPT 6F FLEAPIT +81 229
#note Not a bingo I know, but it's Adam -- he's not likely to play phonies at the best of times...LOL.
>deen: AILNRRS 8A RIL. +12 140
#note There are higher scoring plays, but I figured I needed lines open to have any chance now.
>adam_logan: EGIOO A3 GOOIE. +8 237
#note This was some hope --- now a bingo can close the gap.
>deen: ?AGINRS 2F .RAShING +60 200
#note My last chance here possibly, and I took forever. I was focused on 5 possible lanes, off the C or U of CUR, column B using the I, or 9s thru EN or DE at the far right...I saw (I)NGRAInS very early, but for the life of me could not recall having clearly seen it. It sounded good, INGRAIN/ENGRAIN, but sometimes that's just wishful thinking. (EN)SNARInG is a bit of a silly miss, but even after deciding to bingo off the C, I had so many preferable options to what I played -- I find if I take a long time without finding something I'm happy with, I'll settle for just about any bingo to avoid making the time commitment a total waste. Still this turn deserved to be much better -- INGRAINS in 30 secs would have made it a different game, certainly a bit more hope at least.

#note A bit of psychology here...I had no idea whether CRASHINGS was good or not, but it scored more than anything else, and I was hoping that Adam would also be unsure enough that he would not risk the challenge. Turns out I was right in this speculation (it's not good), but B4 YID 25, hanging onto the S was probably better still. It was an interesting moment psychologically however.
>adam_logan: AGS 5K SAG +18 288
#note Not good news, this looks like another S. K4 AG(I)S(M) for 25, with the same letters, is a cool suggestion by Q.
>deen: CDEINNO B2 CONED +38 272
#note Best.
>adam_logan: AAE 7C A.AE +15 303
>deen: INNORRV J6 .R..ON +9 281
#note I like N6 V(EN)IN in some ways better, but I need more open lines for any hope -- also Adam is likely sitting on the last S, so things don't look encouraging with my rack in any case. E9 (I)RON for one less point than my play is interesting in that respect, an extra row to work with potentially.

#note Yuck. JVZ is not going to play well on this board...oh well I gave it a decent shot at least...
>adam_logan: ALMRSTU N6 M..STRUAL +88 404
#note Very nice...Adam's such a classy guy, if I wasn't rooting for me, I would be for him! :-)

#note The natural play, but as Adam pointed out afterwards, something like 15L B(E) will lead to multiple tile-sticking, either J-, Q-, and/or V-sticks depending on the sequences. Of course, the win and match victory were in hand, and I was once again into a minute of overtime, so it's largely academic, but it shows that he is thinking of these things -- and in some cases, it will probably matter quite a lot!
