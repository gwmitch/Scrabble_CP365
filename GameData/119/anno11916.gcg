#note I didn't really like playing ROOMIE or MOIRA. I thought this would be the best exchange for whatever reason.

>Bill: BEEEIMR I7 BEMIRE +33 33
#note This should probably go on the other side, but it's hard to say.

>Charles: AQT I3 QAT +30 148
>Bill: CEGLRST J8 GET +19 78
#note I basically have three options: score a decent amount by burning the S and resetting the rack (COSTREL or NEGLECTS), score a middling amount with an awkward leave (this and a few other plays), or dump the G for a few points and draw to CELRST. Given the lack of vowels to play through the rack-resetting plays are probably best, but I didn't see either of them.
>Charles: AINOOST 14G O.ATIONS +70 218
>Bill: ACLRSWY 6B CRAWL.. +20 98
#note I saw SCRAWLY but felt sure that it would be a really bad phony. Oh well.
>Charles: UX 15L XU +36 254
>Bill: EHIINSY J2 YIN +31 129
#note I don't have any of the hooks at the moment, but this seems clear from a points + leave perspective. I don't think taking the points with A6 SHINY is getting my anywhere.
>Charles: ACVY 1I CAVY +23 277
>Bill: ?AEHIRS E4 RA.HIdES +102 231
#note A4 HASTIER is also 102.
>Charles: DGIU K4 GUID +20 297
>Bill: ADEGHNT L3 DAH +37 268
#note HANTED for 49 in this spot.
>Charles: DJOU D1 JUDO +44 341
>Bill: EGKNOPT D8 KOP +30 298
#note I wouldn't have thought it was possible to miss KOPJE if you knew it and had it available, but there you go. And I missed it while playing KOP. ENOKI also scores more but doesn't give me a realistic shot at a needed bingo.

>Bill: EEGLNRT 8A GER..N +33 331
>Bill: EEGLNRT --  -33 298
#note This didn't look right, but I was getting desperate and though GHERKIN had an alternate spelling. It does, but it's GIRKIN. And it's Collins-only.

#note Yep, I thought EARNESTS was good but couldn't pull the trigger yet again. Probably doesn't matter at this point, but still...
