#note Oh, brother. Look at that pool. If Nigel dodged the Y's he is pretty much guaranteed to bingo - so I should just take a play like KEG now, and I can probably keep pace with him. There really aren't any effective blocks here, WOK included.

#note Haha. Endgame master at work. I played NEXT because I thought I would have REIGN 15E to go out, unless he took next to no points to block. LE* not being a word is a minor issue. The other play I considered, (EX)ING, turns out to be the only win. A spectacular blunder at a very bad time.
