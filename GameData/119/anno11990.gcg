#note Missed GILBERTS. Saw GERBILS but inexplicably forgot it was better than this.
>Will: BELNRXZ K5 BEZ.L +32 50
#note K5 is best for easier X-age

#note I don't see a need to play HAJ here.
>Matthew: AFILTUY 10A AY +28 161
>Will: EHINNNR 4E RENNIN +11 204
#note RENNIN sims pretty badly, but I don't hate it. 7F NINE sims best, I assume because I might get 8A HAND with an A and has the best combination of score, tile turnover, and not opening heavy counterplay of any play saving HN.
>Matthew: EFILTUU E2 FU.L +14 175
#note I don't know what happened here. I jotted down 14 leaving  LTEU, but then when I looked down at my leave, I realized I played the L and my leave was TEIU, making this play incredible awful. I don't know how I managed to do something so bad. FUL(L)E(S)T.
>Will: ADHIITT H1 THI. +21 225
#note HAINT is a little better, and DIALIST F6 is stylish.
>Matthew: EEGHITU 12H HUE +24 199
>Will: AADIRRT 2A ADRI.T +24 249
#note Hoping that after HUE Matthew kept a bingo-ish leave and drew low-scoring tiles.
>Matthew: AEEEGIT 1A TEE +20 219
>Will: AAAEPRY 8A YA +23 272
#note No reason not to take a couple more points with the DEXY spot.

#note ex GAIOOO
>Will: AAEIPRV 2L .AV +23 295
#note Too equity-ish to turn down.
