#note I looked for an -ING bingo but failed with the K...normally I think I would have a decent shot of finding this one -- sloppy.

#note Another miss: clearly any bingoes will go thru an O. I saw M(O)NGeRED, but wasn't sure if MONGER was a verb or only a noun, as in COSTERMONGER, a seller. And DRaG(O)MEN is something I've seen, but would not likely find...KNEADING was still a bigger miss in my mind.

#note Strangely 1F MOMeNTA is one point more...I didn't count it as the extra overlap seemed intuitively better...LOL. Well at least I got my bingo down finally...

#note Adam didn't mention 15B CL(Y)STERS after the game (I certainly don't know this one), which scores 20 extra points and blocks by best play -- that would have changed things considerably. The disconnected 9 he did play was still nice, nonetheless, but objectively worse.

#note Around here, I started getting too cute I think: the extension QUAY to QUAYSIDE will score 63 points if I can hit it. I already have IDE, so I try fishing for one of two S's or, less ideally, the blank. This expedition might be OK for a few turns, but I persisted for too long I think. 1N EX for 29 is probably simplest and best. A Quackle suggestion I hadn't even considered is the cute 11D (PE)DIGREE for 24, keeping X :-)

My play, ERG, was mistakenly scored as 20.

>deen: ADEIJRX C10 JAR +19 240
#note After Adam's last play, 1N AX should have been close to automatic, still keeping IDE and shutting down column O. It's simply too likely that VOE was a fish. Instead I talk myself into a 3-tile play, continuing my own hopes for S or blank.

#note This keeps (QUAY)SIDE open! M2 (T)AXIED was certainly a less greedy option.

#note I like Quackle's top choices here: G6 (L)I(N)DY 26, or L9 YIPE 29, mainly because they dump an I - of course I didn't know the (WELL)Y hook, and D(WELL) is well hidden. If I'd been able to find a play that burned an I and hooked Y onto NIX I would have played that, but there are none! :-(
>adam_logan: EZ H4 ZE. +22 303
>deen: DEEIIIS H11 DIE +12 329
#note Of course, a third I...good reason to not keep 2 usually. Around here I also noticed there were an awful lot of vowels in the remaining tile pool. Quackle wants to trade, maybe that's better.

>deen: AEEHIIS 13A HIS. +36 365
#note Drawing one of the H's was good fortune here. K1 (ABA)SH scores well too, but this is a bit better. Unless Adam has a bingo now, which looked very unlikely with what was left, I was confident with the lead now.
