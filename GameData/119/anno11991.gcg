#note Keep in mind the history I have with this opponent, and why I was less than thrilled to have this first round matchup. I don't think it affected my play, but you could say I was a bit on edge.
>dacrON: CDDERSU 9H DUD +19 19
#note Not an auspicious start...?

>dacrON: ?GILMNW M3 M.W +21 77
#note Well, looks like it's gonna be one of THOSE game 1s where I suck. My play is barely worse than WIM(P)LING, but I'd have played it if I'd seen it.
>Mike: BIO 5F OBI +16 93
>dacrON: ?DGILNP 6D DIP +22 99
#note I was not sure of DaP(P)LING. He also exposed a blank here, so I decided to play it safe.
>Mike: EHI D3 HIE. +16 109
>dacrON: ?EGLNRT E6 .NTEGRaL +66 165
#note Perhaps GRuNTLE is a tad better.

#note Yep, I just did that.
>Mike: AJ H13 .AJ +27 198
>dacrON: ABEEIRT 8K ..BER +30 195
>Mike: KLOT N7 K.LT +10 208
#note He put down K(E)TOL immediately, then took the O off and played this. Given my play of FIGEATE(R) all lined up I was pretty shocked - how could this possibly be the right play so quickly?!
