#note ummmmmmmmmmmmmm...I'm going to say that I made this play because I had the blank and wanted to go for lots of shots at a bingo next turn, including even a 2x2. To be honest, though, I don't remember if that was my logic, or if I just missed OFT. Either way, TAJ is better.

#note I'd love advice here. is YO(U) really that much better? I figure he must have halfway decent tiles after plays like YONI and HERN.

#note realized EATER was much better right after I hit the clock. at about 30 seconds now though.

#note Seems good, especially with little time on my clock - just don't empty the bag.

#note Mistracked here, so I thought he didn't have anything, but it's still the obvious place to block. I had better plays, but under 15 seconds when the play started.
