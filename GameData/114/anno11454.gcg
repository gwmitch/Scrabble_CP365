#note Interesting sim result.  While I'm not surprised that this is best, I *am* surprised that the duck thinks keeping the Y and playing IRON for 23 is also good.  I think that's misleading; Y backhook or not, I just don't see how it's smart to give him an easy run at the K column with 11 E's and 4 S's unseen.

#note Q gives the most marginal of preferences to 2G EVUL(s)ION, but the difference is style preference.  He's 47% to win.
>Jim_Burlant: DEELRXY 4A DEXY +44 145
#note Yes, I saw J5 EX.  I didn't like saddling myself with the Y and at the time I didn't mind trading the 6 points on the scoreboard to unload it.  In retrospect, I was too impatient.  This board virtually guaranteed me a Y play somewhere on my next turn (either on row 4, or on row 11 back-hooking ART).  There was no need to slot the triple and sacrifice the 6 scoreboard points.
>Darrell_Day: AEGGNRT 2G GANG.TER +76 191
#note Nice find!
>Jim_Burlant: DDELORS A4 .ODDER +27 172
#note Q doesn't like this at all, saying instead that I should fish with D4 (YO)D.  Its second choice, 3B DO is a compromise between the pure fish and a scoring play.  Given all the unseen A's and E's, I don't mind blowing this up for 27 and opening up a lane for 7's.
>Darrell_Day: AHI 1G AHI +38 229
>Jim_Burlant: AFKLRRS 6J F.LAR +31 203
#note Best - 29% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AINU 1L UNAI +22 251
>Jim_Burlant: BIKMRSS 11I SMIRK +34 237
#note By no means is this a bad play, but Q gives slight preference to 10A SKIM.  This is probably because I'm burning the case R - my tracking still showed 2 R's unplayed at this point, which is why I made this mistake.   Still 29-1/2% to win.
>Darrell_Day: OV C2 VO. +26 277
>Jim_Burlant: AABISSU 8K .UBAS +24 261
#note Or TABUS.    Still treading water - no change in my winning chances.
>Darrell_Day: ILL O8 .ILL +4 281
>Jim_Burlant: AAEIMNS 3G AM +18 279
#note Q just wants me to fish off an A with J9 NOMA or M11 KA and it doesn't like this at all.  But this did work out.  43% to win.
>Darrell_Day: CETU M8 .UC.ET +30 311
>Jim_Burlant: AEHINSW 14G WAHINES +80 359
#note Best bingo (the other option being INSWATHE) and I'm winning 60%.  But the unseen JZ made me feel this one was anything but safe.
>Darrell_Day: EJN H12 JE.N +57 368
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEFST 4K .EEF +18 377
#note Best is apparently 12K FEE.  I'd rather take the bag down to 1 and draw 3 to AEST.
>Darrell_Day: DEOZ 15F ZO.ED +28 396
>Jim_Burlant: ACEIPST 10A SPAT +22 399
#note  I spent several minutes on this turn.  At first, I put down any number of plays and kept pulling them up because everything I was initially seeing lost.  After almost 6 minutes, I figured out that this won and put it down.  However, Darrell's comment made it clear I'd missed my best play: "You missed SPECIATE, you dumbass!", and Chris Cree, sitting at the next board, broke out laughing, saying he'd have never seen it on this board.   All's fair - I'd told Darrell he was a dumbass for missing ANURETI(C) against me in Salado, and I repeated the favor when, in club a couple of weeks ago, he whiffed on IDONE(O)US and instead put down DINE(R)OUS* against someone else. What are friends for if you can't give them a hard time?  :-)
