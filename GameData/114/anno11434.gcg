#note he has a few potential 8s, but the one I think he might have a shot at is maziness. I also don't want to give up a cheap ZA. just 8D looks ok. I guess this was too obviously an attempt to bate him.

#note no way!
>JD: DEEEEOU -EEEOU +0 70
#note exchanging after a successful challenge can sometimes feel wrong, but it's often a nice idea.
>David_Slavin: ?AEMNSZ N6 ZE. +33 33
>JD: DEIQRSU J2 QUERID.S +90 160
#note I thought about going for SQUIRED/AGATOIDS for 150, but given his refusal to play there I think he would have challenged it off.
>David_Slavin: ?AEEMNS 5D MEANdE.S +86 119
#note that was going to happen at some point
>JD: AEIIIMO I7 A.IO +14 174
#note amie ends up simming a lot better. AMIE is quite good defense.
>David_Slavin: ERUY 2J .UERY +34 153
#note from this turn onwards david was unstoppable.
>JD: EIIKMNO 4D MONIE +36 210
#note in spite of opening a triple lane kino wins the sim because EIM is so much more likely to do something useful (ither hitting row 1 or bingoing).
>David_Slavin: BFOS 1L FOBS +57 210
#note in spite of giving me two turns, david has already chased me down.

>David_Slavin: CEHT 3B ECHT +31 241
#note man!
>JD: ADIKNRT 3G KRA.T +31 271
#note reink would've been great. I think I hadn't seen it for a while.

#note who is this guy?!
>JD: ADHIINT N10 HID +33 304
>David_Slavin: OW 6F WO +35 311
#note good for me he didn't see 
WECHT.
>JD: AAAINNT O4 ANA +15 319
#note playing ana at G9 doesn't sim any worse.
>David_Slavin: CILOP 12H POLIC.. +30 341
>JD: AINPRTU 13C PURITAN +79 398
#note very lucky, didn't have anything else that fit
>David_Slavin: BEN 3M BEN +32 373
#note christ, what do I have to do to stay ahead?!
>JD: AEGILLO C9 GALO. +10 408
#note i almost played gaoler but I noticed there were very few vowels left. quackle likes playing the extra tile better anyway. I get an extra chance of drawing an S or the blank. logier sims best of all.
>David_Slavin: JNTUY 10B J.UNTY +34 407
>JD: ?EFIILR D12 F.EL +26 434
#note by now I had gotten really low on time. there are plenty of winning plays but my obvious choice on row 14 gives up gloves for a loss. this play depends on me playing IRING, which I wasn't 100% on. of course, I missed a bingo...firelit! my first bingo miss of the tournament.
