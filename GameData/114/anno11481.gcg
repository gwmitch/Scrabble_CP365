#note Yikes... G7 UTE is winning the sim? Barely a point above EAU, but it's still surprising. I guess Both EAU placements give a lot back. UTE gives nothing. Still... AEIH?

#note K4 OX is a big play to not cash in on. And WARN? is a strong leave. But I don't need to rush the X play, and this POLITIC spot is really dangerous to leave open. Quackle says this is wrong and I should cash the X and try to bingo next turn. Should I be more worried at this score?
>Deen_Hergott: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 137
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: ?EEEFWX 4J .EW +26 129
#note Again I decide not to rush the X. Want to weaken the easy scoring spots here and set up a stronger X play next turn. But JEFE seems obviously better and I dunno wht I didn't consider it.

#note FLEXTIME!!! Also, FAX and AXE under JEW may be better than this. Abundance of E's unseen might be worrisome. But I hated giving him an easy KOP at 3K.

#note This sims worse than all other available bingos for obvious reasons. But I decided to gamble on Deen not knowing the S hook. If he doesn't, this play is pretty powerful, giving me a big play that he won't have. Although it still gives back big H and M plays on row 15, which could block my access to the S-hook. Perhaps I should have just taken FUNNELED? Less risk, but less reward. Deen didn't know the S hook, btw.

#note I decided to kill the easy Q spot. It's probably unnecessary, since Deen is pretty screwed if he has the Q no matter what. But this also kills some of the only open vowels, which will hurt Deen a lot given teh unseen pool. 
>Deen_Hergott: CGO D2 C.OG +18 301
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: AENRRST 13K ER +12 336
#note I didn't consider just dropping an R with UNITIZER. But this setup looks like it seals the deal. If Deen has the Q, he is stuck with it. If I draw the Q, I have a big QAT or TRANQ. No matter what, I have a big play atop RUM. I don't see how Deen can catch up after this.
