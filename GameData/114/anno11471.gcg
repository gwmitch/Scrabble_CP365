#note it took me a long time to realize that this rack had fishing potential. just dropping the B sims well but rafi is likely to adjust his next play to take out the S. I like my play.

#note I didn't think reflag was good. it sims pretty much even with this play. consonants seem better to keep with lots of scoring spot available.

#note I asked rafi if he was gonna triple-triple and he said "no, my play is more of a hard 7, soft 8". I've gotta start using that.

#note intriguingly dropping HOS actually ends up with a higher win percentage, keeping him from taking the S hook himself. still I don't think EILT is worth passing up the bingo for. I would rather give myself a shot at drawing the case S.

#note sharp play, guess he has the last E. uh oh.
>JD: APVVWWZ 4L W.Z +30 398
#note my chances are not good one way or the other, especially knowing that the E must be in the bag. however, I think ZIP here should be better than WIZ - in spite of duplicating the W, if I play for drawing the S and a vowel, then the second W will allow me to score more than the P will. I would also love to hold onto the Z for 10B but short of VAV at E8 I see no great alternatives that do that.
