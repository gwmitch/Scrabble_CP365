>Carl_Johnson: AHOOW 8D WAHOO +30 30
>JD: ?BEIQRU 7H BRIQUEt +73 73
#note carl looked frustrated that I had started yet another game against him by hitting an early bingo. somehow, I didn't think he would be ok with me laying down obliquer* (remember it's beliquor)
>Carl_Johnson: CEORV N2 COVER. +24 54
>JD: EEIMSTY O7 STYMIE +54 127
#note wasn't 100% on this spelling, but it was worth enough extra.
>Carl_Johnson: EOTU K7 .UOTE +28 82
>JD: EHJLMRU 12I JUREL +39 166
>Carl_Johnson: AEW 9G WAE +25 107
>JD: AFGHIMV N10 HM +34 200
#note I'll probably be able to cash this play anytime. my standard deviation after HM is very low (clunky rack means very few star plays). that said I prefer it to a play like FIVE that opens things for him.
>Carl_Johnson: AAEG 4K AGA.E +20 127
#note for some reason I was paranoid that he would bingo this turn but instead he evidently drew AAE.
>JD: AFGGIOV 5H VIGA +20 220
#note this particular lane seemed dangerous enough to be worth sacrificing a few points to block.
>Carl_Johnson: EEILLNU 2L LU.E +6 133
#note his actual rack
>JD: AEFGINO -  +0 220
#note I challenged pretty quickly. luce looked totally unfamiliar.
>Carl_Johnson: NPY J11 P.NY +21 154
#note fortunately carl's next play was self-descriptive and I didn't get punished too badly.
>JD: AEFGINO M9 FOA.ING +43 263
#note in fact his last play makes this play considerably safer. I didn't realize that STYMIEING would be good but this is better.
>Carl_Johnson: EIKLNS 1H SILKEN +38 192
#note so what do you read into this play? he could just play INKLE and leave a new lane. I'm not sure what he could have here that would make it worthwhile to burn the S. another S?
>JD: AADEERT E5 AER.TED +32 295
#note I was hoping he'd give me a lane but this pretty much seals the deal.
>Carl_Johnson: FILO F10 FOIL +31 223
>JD: ADENOTX F4 TAX +53 348
#note tax is a significant upgrade over ax given how consonant-heavy the pool is.
>Carl_Johnson: DIOPRTZ 2D TORPID +16 239
#note his actual rack
>JD: BDENNOS O1 B.N. +20 368
#note I correctly read him as having the Z when he played TORPID (there are no other high-scoring tiles so he's likely to get to cash the spot). however, I talked myself out of BONED for fear that he would bingo out from the B. if I'd really done the math I would've realized that there was no way he could catch me even after britzska/bartizan. a safe alternative is just playing BONE at 3C.
>Carl_Johnson: IITZ 1A ZITI +45 284
#note should've stuck with my gut! the blank came out of the bag on this play.
>JD: CDENOSS 14A CODENS +32 400
#note scends is best, this gives up plays on column D.
