#note nice find!
>JD: AMMRRTU J2 MUM. +24 275
#note mumu at 4F is awesome!!! however playing MURA or MURRA dominates the sim. there are lots of As left. holding the M leads me to score an extra 4-5 points next turn.

>JD: AAORRTX 11E RATO +24 299
#note I didn't even see TAXA but hoding the X sims pretty nicely. I am a big underdog. ROTA does quite well on the sim but probably looks too shady to work.

>JD: AGORSTX 15L .ROG +29 328
#note cashing the X wins the sim. I thought about playing ox now but thought holding the X had a better potential of a big score.

#note his actual rack. cool play!

>Jason_Katz-Brown: ACEFINN --  -32 373
#note a huge break! this is exactly what I needed.
>JD: AAAITTV E3 AVIAT. +18 390
#note unfortunately I totally blew this play. I saw that he would have FIN at 10B for 30, and that he might not be able to use row 13. However, I played AVIATE anyway thinking that I would probably be able to win the subsequent endgame with an out-in-two. the best options block FIN - either AWAIT or VIA (I didn't think of AWAIT).
>Jason_Katz-Brown: ACEFINN 10B FIN +30 403
>JD: AACORTV 14C OCTAV. +13 403
#note unfortunately, I flat out blew this endgame under time pressure. I looked for plays at column M but somehow missed VOTER, which leaves CARAT and ACARI as my two outs.

#note I got enough breaks that I could've won this game, but unfortunately I screwed up the pre-endgame and endgame too severely.
