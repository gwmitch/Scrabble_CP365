#note I overscored this play by one point, which comes into play later in the game.

#note Going for the YO prize.
>Rafi: BGHINOT 9E BOTH +27 113
#note Kenji overdrew and I flipt over BRO and threw back the R. Not sure what I should do with the inference, given that all the JO plays give back JOB and given that with the YO prize, OI could infer anything...

#note Tough decision, as all my scoring plays block a lane. I figured FIZ was the best because it still allows me to play -ATE bingos, and I could luck into DETONATE or NICTATED or something.

#note Kenji realized afterwards that he missed COHOG, which takes out the SPAM lane.
>Rafi: ADDNOST 14A TOD +21 298
#note Quackle wants me to play DAD in the top right, but that doesn't seem right because it allows Kenji to take out SPAM with a play on row 12. This also sets up AND if I don't draw a bingo right away.

>Rafi: ADGLNRS 5I DRA..NG +22 342
#note Knowing Kenji has the C and could play COHOG, I think it's necessary to open another lane and draw for the blank. PAM isn't going to stay open for long.

#note Quackle says LUV wins the most... I have no idea how to figure this out. I guess I do have some draws for bingos ending in a vowel.
>Kenji: DDIMOST B8 DIMS +21 438
#note The only play that wins 100% according to quackle.
>Rafi: ?ALOSTY 2D LAYOuTS +74 421
#note Coming into the game, I was 7-4 along with Chris and Carl but with a terrible spread, so the only way I could get third was if they both lost. What I didn't realize was that a tie would have been good in this scenario, so I asked for a recount and discovered the point against me. Turns out Carl and Chris both lost, so recounting the game cost me third place. Weirdest way to lose $200...
