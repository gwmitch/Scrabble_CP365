#note Yikes!  I saw FOZY and considered HONK. What I didn't like about HONK despite having the Y to hook it was that I didn't like my odds of having to draw an O to score with FOZYU if I only turned 3 tiles with this much crap in my rack.  I thought that if I turned 4 tiles and kept FZ, it would give me a reasonable chance at either an A for FAZ(ED) down the D column or ZE(K) if I drew an E.  Q wants me to play FOZY for 19 and says this is not quite a 3-point dog.  I'd make this play again.

>Jim_Burlant: BGINORZ K5 ZIG +40 167
#note I saw this and felt that if he didn't have A and S or a playable bingo in his rack, he really wasn't going to burn me too badly.  I felt that 40 points was worth the risk.  Quackle feels that BRIG K4 is apparently the play; this is runner up, but it wins 78.9% to BRIG's 81-1/2%.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ADELS L4 LASED +43 132
>Jim_Burlant: BNNNORR -BNNOR +0 167
#note Enough of this crap!  The sim says that, depending on your stylistic preference, it's either this or M7 ROB; they sim interchangeably.  I didn't think it was worth the 18 points to leave myself NNNR.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: GIJ M3 JIG +37 169
>Jim_Burlant: AAHNRRY 8L .RAY +24 191
#note A trap I have to remind myself to not fall into is that, if I've struggled with poor draws for too many turns (and outside of my opening rack bingo, racks 2, 3, 4, and 6 have been nothing but the lowest-probability worst-case swill I could pull), the instant I do get something that can be groomed, I start grooming it on autopilot and don't look for my best plays.  This choice's AHNR leave has some decent bingo potential with all the unseen E's and I's, but this play gives up WAY too much on the scoreboard to 12C RAYAH (which scores 45), which should have been the play.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ACIPTU O2 PAUCIT. +15 184
>Jim_Burlant: AHLMNRU N1 MU +16 207
#note Now the draw of the U rattled me, as I was practically expecting an E, I, or even an O.  Given the struggles I had in the Cree game and given how this one seemed to be unraveling, I was too annoyed to be thinking straight, and I blew it.  Once I hit the clock, I realized my mistake:  HUMAN 12A should have been the play.  This is awful.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIRUV N7 E.U +5 189
#note Sam put down VIER 12B before pulling it up and putting this down.  I've played Sam often enough to know that, if he thinks you're close to a bingo, he'll pass up his best play in favor of ultra-cheap defense if it shuts down what he thinks you're about to hit.  While there was no excuse for my missing HUMAN on the previous turn, I suspect he misread my MU play as meaning that I was close to a bingo down the M or N columns, and he wanted to shut that down. This choice by Sam bailed me out of my two previous blunders.
>Jim_Burlant: AAHLNOR 12A HORAL +36 243
#note Right before Sam had put down VIER, I had noticed 12A.  This is best, and it's not even close between this and HORA in the sim.  71% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: EEINOPS 13E PEONIES +66 325
#note The only bingo.  Against a random rack it wins 94%.  Against Sam's next rack, it wins 68.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ?DILORT 15A .LyTROID +77 320
#note Very nice find!  
>Jim_Burlant: AEIINRT A1 ERA +26 351
#note A strong choice, but not best in Quackle's eyes.  Quackle prefers that I fish with 1L AIM, but I think that's deceptive.  Sam is certain to block that if I play there.  I'd rather put points on the board and force him to try and score somewhere.  If you forego trying to bingo, it's either this or ETA in the same spot.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ABBENOO 6N B. +22 342
#note This was Sam's actual rack.  At the time, we thought Sam misplayed his end game and that he should have put down ABOON 12I 22.  What Quackle shows is that, as bleak as my draw had been for much of this game and as poorly as I played on turns 7 and 8, because I left EE in the bag, Sam doesn't have a win here no matter what he does.  Even if he puts down BABOON or ABOON to go out ahead of me instead of playing this, I'll be able to milk my tiles for points with (EKE)S/(QADI)S and IT(S)/(VEX)T on successive turns, and he won't be able to go out quickly enough to catch me.
>Jim_Burlant: IINNNST K10 INN. +8 359
#note Best, as it blocks ABOON.  
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: ABEENOO E3 NE. +7 349
>Jim_Burlant: EINST F5 SET. +29 388
#note Good, but not best.  6A NE sets me up to go out with SITS F5 on the next turn.
