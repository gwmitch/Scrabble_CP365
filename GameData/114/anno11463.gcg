#note I wouldn't normally play long from here but I couldn't see a better alternative. however I forgot to think about exchanging. Throwing back AU rocks the sim.

#note ooh no fimbriae. mbira is an extremely tough find. afire sims even though - the resulting board sets up great spots for the B and the M.

>Jesse_Matthews: CHIIIUW K5 CHI. +20 351
#note jm beat me to the punch again. I figured I would play through and hope to hit a play at O12. the question is really how long will it take me to clean up the junk. throwing back IIUW may end up being better.
