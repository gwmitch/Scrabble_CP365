#note didn't see viewier which I ever so slightly prefer

>JD: BEEFSUY 9G BEEFY +31 107
#note I should've looked harder, BEY is at least worth considering.

#note huge miss! mizunas would've been awesome!

>JD: FHNOSUV N6 FO.HN +21 220
#note it seemed like it was time to shut these lanes down. even without any inferences (his rack is likely a little better than average) the sim brings it a lot closer to FOEHN at 14G. I think it was time.
>Mark_Schellenberg: ?ALORTU F5 LO.. +8 183
>JD: ADEOSUV E2 UVEA +18 238
#note I didn't see vadose, which is probably an upgrade. uvea doesn't really drop his bingo percentages much at all. vadose at 4A would be a great idea.
>Mark_Schellenberg: ACDG 4A CADG. +24 207
>JD: DIIMOQS B3 Q.ID +18 256
#note I didn't want to set up a cheap spot to overlap the Q but failed to notice that this also creates the possibility of an overlap. I wanted to hold on to the case S. IMIDO at M2 is a cool idea.
>Mark_Schellenberg: LLL 2D L.LL +6 213
#note a stroke of bad luck for me! he blocks my bingo with this.
>JD: IIMNNOS 3B .I +28 284
#note after the game I felt that this play had cost me the game, but I may be guilty of 20/20 hindsight. cashing the I is tempting but I think that MINX at M7 does a much more proactive job of shaping the board. column O is the most dangerous lane on the board.
>Mark_Schellenberg: AH 1G AH +17 230
>JD: IMNNOOS E10 MOON +22 306
#note NOMOI on column L takes out another lane while being almost as many point.
>Mark_Schellenberg: AEEINRT O1 TRAINEE. +84 314
>JD: BEEINSY F11 BYE +21 327
#note my subpar defense lands me in trouble. ideally I would create another lane.
>Mark_Schellenberg: ?AEGOPT 3G POTAGEs +84 398
>JD: DEINSTT D1 E. +3 330
#note fishing for distinct, hoping that he sees all the consonants and decides not to block. I should really play the E somewhere else though, since my play prevents him from screwing up by playing on row 1.
>Mark_Schellenberg: ADIORRU L11 DOUR +13 411
>JD: CDINSTT 1A DIC. +21 351
#note inducts is 3 better, I was super-low on time
>Mark_Schellenberg: AIR O10 AIR +6 417
>Mark_Schellenberg:  (NSTT) +8 425
#note I got a bit unlucky, but really I played bad defense and deserved to lose the game.
