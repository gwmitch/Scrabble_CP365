#note I wanted to save the GY combo for use at J9-10, giving up an extra nine points and the good GN synergy this turn. Is this crazy? It sure didn't work out very well.
>Steve: EENNX 13H .NNEXE +28 49
>Bill: EGIJTVY L11 VE.T +28 86
#note JIVEY is a lot better in valuation, but I feel like I've got to take the X out. Also still hoping for a -GY play.
>Steve: ?COPRST N8 COPTeRS +96 145
#note ANNEXER is phony. If I've seen that before I didn't remember it, because it didn't look funny at all. POSTCARD is the best real play.

#note He blocked LIVINGLY, but that's okay because I didn't know it (weird word). I'm not sure what I was going for with this play. 12D VINYL looks best to me, but I didn't see it for some reason.

>Bill: ADGIINP 2J PI. +13 159
#note Yeah, just play PI at O4 for 20. It's not worth seven points to open another mediocre lane.

#note Didn't think of REFED for three more. It keeps AS instead of ES, but there's plenty of E's unseen, so it seems to be an improvement.

#note This position is very hard to get a handle on. I actually played QI pretty quickly. I knew there were many ways for the fish to go wrong, but I didn't think there was much of an option. The sim implies that bingoing is necessary, as the top-scoring plays (K5 GAITS for 38 keeping EII and E5 STAGGIE for 36 keeping I) don't even make the cut, but the clear winner after several thousand iterations surprisingly turns out to be... D1 TRIAGE, winning a little over 25%. Why? Damned if I know.

>Bill: AEGISTT D8 .GITATES +70 380
#note Collins tried to sabotage me once again, but this time I was able to talk myself out of TAGGIEST#. The real question here is whether I should play at D8 or D4. I chose this because, in addition to the potentially crucial extra two points, I'm basically forcing the blank to be used as an S to hook QI if he wants a bingo. However, I think the possibility of a bingo is a red herring here. Even with a blank, the pool is junky enough that a bingo is unlikely after either placement of AGITATES, whereas the placement can make a significant difference in his ability to outrun me without a bingo, specifically in regards to giving him a TWS to use. Quackle says that not bingoing and trying to hit an outbingo is significantly more likely to win, but I'm disregarding that because I don't feel qualified to make that kind of play. Between this and the D4 placement, the sim says that D4 wins slightly more often. In actuality, D4 would leave him with two winning plays, as does this. He found the better, and far flashier, of the two.

#note We both thought the bingo and EFI? draw had won it for me until he came up with this, but the more straightforward C10 HELIO also gets the job done.
