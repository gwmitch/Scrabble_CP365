>Jim_Burlant: ?AEEEHH 8G HEH +18 18
#note A little iffy to keep no consonants, but I felt that, with the blank I could give myself a little more latitude.  The sim agrees - this is best.
>Darrell_Day: ADELNSV H8 .NSLAVED +89 89
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAEEIT 9D AlIE.ATE +71 89
#note The only bingo that plays on row 15 is ERADIATE 15E for 59.  The only other bingos that play are ALIENATE on row 11 and this choice.  11G ALIENATE doesn't give easy plays on the triples, but it only scores 64 and it still gives back D and S hooks down the O column as well as a big play at N10.  This is best, but the sim reflects the consternation I had over this position:  I'm only 39% to win.
>Darrell_Day: BOOT 8A BOOT +24 113
>Jim_Burlant: KLNNPSY K8 P.NNY +20 109
#note Nothing really great available, and apparently I had to be more patient about cleaning this up.  The play should have been PLONK B6 for 27.    PLONK wins 45%; this wins 42.  But, given my next draw, nothing would have really helped.
>Darrell_Day: AIOT 8K .ATIO +24 137
>Jim_Burlant: IKLNSUV 12K .UK +20 129
#note Not much I could do here.  PATIO was a routine play from a scoring perspective, but it really hurt in that it took away the one strong play I otherwise would have had, PLUNK 8K.  This is best.
>Darrell_Day: ?EGIPQU 14H .QUIPaGE +92 229
#note Beautiful find by Darrell; he's now 85% to win.  Incorrectly scored as 90.
>Jim_Burlant: FIILNSV O11 FIV.S +36 165
#note Best.  10% to win.
>Darrell_Day: OY N10 YO +18 247
>Jim_Burlant: DIILNRW 11E WIL. +14 179
#note One of the top 3 choices, but there was a really cool play available I didn't see:  D8 (TA)ILWIND scores 28, and it's best.  I saw 10D WIN and didn't like the board position with it, and this is the next best option.  Just shy of 9% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AELM 7C MEAL +19 266
>Jim_Burlant: DIILNRS F4 DIL. +7 186
#note I saw Quackle's preferred choice of 15H DIN and didn't like it - I thought he'd be one overlapping or play away from killing columns L - O, so I had to open up.Q likes 15H DIN and 12F DIAL.
>Darrell_Day: OTW K5 TWO..... +32 298
#note Nice play!
>Jim_Burlant: DEEINRS M1 RESIDEN. +70 256
#note Or NERDIEST.

>Darrell_Day: AEEMR L2 RAMEE +36 364
#note Ouch!
>Jim_Burlant: BCEORUX N1 .X +38 316
#note Best - 3-1/2% winning chances.  Woo hoo.  Q also likes OX 4C, which scores identically - I guess it keeps row 2 alive for 9's where this choice doesn't.  
>Darrell_Day: AIOZ B2 AZI.O +34 398

#note As I put this down, Darrell's comment:  "Lots of ugliness in the bag for you."
