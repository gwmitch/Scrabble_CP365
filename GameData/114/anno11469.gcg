#note playing phonies against noah tends to work out terribly, but in this case he let it go after holding for 3 minutes. I felt worse and worse about it the longer I was on hold.

#note for some reason I convinced myself that odder wasn't good. actually hoed is the best-simming option by a point or two.

#note for some reason I liked playing short better than oriole here even though the leave doesn't look great. sim agrees with me. oriole takes out a lot of bingo lanes if I think he's close. but qi doesn't suggest that much about the rest of his tiles.

#note quackle absolutely despises this play. I'm kind of confused. quackle's favorites are ERRING or PRIG. PRIG bingoes 45% of the time next turn, whereas ERRING scores 10 more. I guess the game is too close to be leaving that many points on the table, and I don't have a lead so I can't afford to be so defensive. however...

#note repute is an option but now that I've opened a lead and the board is closing down I would rather not go and open it for him again.
>Young_Noah_T._Walton: ANOX 1L AXON +50 282
#note so much for a lead

#note I found the right spot but not the right play...bodkin is gorgeous.

#note damnit! bawty is a dream play but I convinced myself that it was only bawtie. my play has good winning chances but also ups his bingo percentage from 3% to 20% since he otherwise has no lanes.

#note I thought that a blank was unseen at the time and that I was effectively guaranteed to lose the game. as it turns out I think this is a pretty bad option. he bingoes through the D with 16/36 available tile combinations and almost all the reasonable ones for him to have after fishing the U. quackle comes up with DEBIT at N8 which considerably limits what bingos fit on column O.
