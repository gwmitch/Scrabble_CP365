#note I prefer what UNNOTED does to the board compared to DEVOUT.

>JD: EHKLNRV 9H .H +9 191
#note I only saw trode and not erode for some reason. with erode there, this play is definitely an overreaction. the best play by a mile is ALIVE at 11H to set up HARK/HONK, which is not an easy find.

#note carl is a scary dude. this seemed to come closest to sealing the deal. then again, given the circumstances maybe I should just fish.
>Carl_Johnson: BLLOOPY -BLLO +0 229
#note ouch!
>JD: DEILOOP M7 DIPLOE +21 381
#note with this big of a lead I am probably being too paranoid. just wanted to keep it tight and get the game over with.
