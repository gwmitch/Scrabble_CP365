>Jim_Burlant: ?DFHIJY 8D JIfFY +50 50
#note For the lower-division players looking at this game, the rule of thumb is that the blank should be valued in the neighborhood of 27 or 28 points; in other words, I better score at least 27 or 28 more points than my best play that doesn't use the blank.  Without burning the blank, the only options  I have are HID or YID for 14, and this scores 50.  This is best.
>Chris_Cree: MOO 7E MOO +17 17
>Jim_Burlant: AADHLPR H4 HARD. +23 73
#note  E5 AD(MI)RAL scores 40. If you miss that, as I did, this is as good as anything else.  But ADMIRAL was the play.
>Chris_Cree: EGI I3 GIE +13 30
>Jim_Burlant: ACILPXZ G3 ZA +27 100
#note Q says this si a very close second to 5D PLICAE, but the difference in the sim is negligible.
>Chris_Cree: DEIRU D8 .URIED +28 58
>Jim_Burlant: BCIILPX C12 PIX +34 134
#note I didn't like this much since it gives back a whole lot of easy plays, but the sim confirms that there really is nothing else that scores.  Interestingly, BI C12 is als a strong choice in the sim's eyes.
>Chris_Cree: ABN B13 BAN +34 92
>Jim_Burlant: BCEIILS A14 LI +22 156
#note  I felt that either 3E BIZ or 10C CRIB were the pure rack balancers, but I didn't want to pin my hopes on the bingo - on this board, it was too likely not to play.  And if he had drawn someting clunky like a W, I didn't want him to be able to milk the X for 34 more with something like WE or WO.  Q agrees - even though this wasn't even one of the original choices, it's best.  I'm 76% to win, but between my falling asleep at the switch and the subsequent draw, I can't win this game.
>Chris_Cree: EINORSS 11D .RONISES +82 174
#note I wasn't paying close attention when Chris put down IRONISES*.  As I was figuring out what I was going to do here, I suddenly took notice and realized I'd fallen asleep at the switch, as I knew I should have challenged his phony off the board.  Chris had a legitimate play down the E column:  RI(MI)NESS E5 53. 
>Jim_Burlant: BCEGISU 10J BUG +24 180
#note Best - nothing else worth consideration.  51% to win.  
>Chris_Cree: CLMNU F10 C.LUMN +22 196
>Jim_Burlant: AACEHIS 15D HA.CE +42 222
#note Best.  60% to win.  
>Chris_Cree: ENRT 3C NERT. +28 224
>Jim_Burlant: AADEIIS E3 .IA +6 228
#note Looking at the kibbitzer options prior to simming, 12I IDEA looks like it should have been the play.  I was definitely too fishy here, though the sim does say this, which wins 55%, is second best; IDEA wins 58.
>Chris_Cree: OPTT D2 P.TTO +20 244
>Jim_Burlant: ADEIKSV 14H DAK +21 249
#note Didn't look closely enough at the board here.   I was intent on preserving my S to bingo down the M column; if that's the case I should have played H10 KIVA, which I somehow missed.  However, given my next draw it didn't matter what I put down here.
>Chris_Cree: Q H10 Q. +11 255
>Jim_Burlant: AEISUVW L8 VU. +11 260
#note Didn't like burning the S with SUAVE M10, so I thought I'd get cute by setting up VIEW for the next turn.  Q gives slight preference to M10 SUAVE, and this is the silver medalist.
>Chris_Cree: DEV 12J DEV +23 278
>Jim_Burlant: AAEISSW 8L .AWS +30 290
#note Right idea, wrong execution.  WAVIES 8J is best, and with all the E's in the unseen pool, I should have unloaded mine.  However, the consolation I can take is that, given his next rack, anything floating the S would have lost the game.  The only play that would have left me in with a chance was M12 AWA.  This one sealed my fate.
>Chris_Cree: ?ENNOOT O1 cONNOTE. +74 352
#note Best bingo for Chris; of note:  M2 ENTOZOAN.  
>Jim_Burlant: AEEEIRS E10 E.E +14 304
#note Anything is as good as anything else - 6% to win.  I needed to have drawn one of those T's instead of a THIRD E to have had a comeback bingo of WEARIEST.
