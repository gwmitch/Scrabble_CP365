#note Surprised that Quackle likes VERA L2 a little better than this. Even with both blanks, JN?? is a weird leave, and the board doesn't look great for it. I'd rather play JIVE and open big juicy hooks.

#note No need to be so fishy here. No guarantee that I hit a bingo, no guarantee that it plays, and no guarantee that it's not the "59 points, massive counterplays" type of bingo. OCELOID for 26 is fine.

#note I liked this to kill lots of bingos, but Quackle says Richard is only 3.6 percent to bingo even if play EIDE 1G, the clear equity play. I guess the pool is pretty gross and EIDE puts me up almost 100, so it's silly to get paranoid here.

#note Gah, ISM B1 scores 40 and sets up a very-unlikely-to-be-blocked QI! If I were good at Scrabble, I'd see stuff like this all the time. But I'm me, and I never even realized LAUGHTER took an S.

#note Lots of things sim close, but DOWSE M9 to score and set up the F looks pretty nifty here.

#note Well, this is best, but only because it saves that ISM play that I didn't see.
