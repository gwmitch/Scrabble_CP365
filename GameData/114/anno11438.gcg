#note the moment of truth...the longer this stayed on the board the more convinced I was that it was coming off (he held for a few minutes). then again, it is so much better than my best real play that I should go for it even if I think there is only a 50% chance of it staying on.

#note overlooked fishable, although this takes out an easier lane

#note bold! here are some numbers I wrote down - 95% chance of me winning if I challenge it off, 80% chance of winning if I accept it, 60% chance if I challenge and it's good. quackle agrees with these estimates pretty well, although my winning chances are more like 70% even if I lose a turn challenging. From that, you can figure out that I need to think that it has about a 50% chance of being good to leave it on -and I think my estimate was 30%, but I still chickened out and left it on.

#note this play was tricky. once I figured out that no bingos fit I wanted to give myself an easier lane to make sure I woudn't miss again.

#note ampul setting up the case E is pretty tempting. I didn't think o it.

>JD: ADEGPRT E10 GAD +25 387
#note I either chickened out of portaged or flat out missed it. I think I missed it entirely.

#note apparently he had nothing through the H but I wanted to make sure to take it out in case.

#note rafi didn't realize that I couldn't go out so he burned the blank for the extra point!
