#note tricky play, I could hook on column J now with audio/podia too.

#note again there are no all-star choices. this sims best by a little

#note ow! ow! ow!
>JD: AGGINOT 4K TOG +16 90
#note though goading sims close, in a tight game early I would rather try to make a play that gets me closer to the first bingo.
>Marilyn_Murray: EEP E4 PEE +15 116
>JD: AGIMNTZ N1 NIZAM +37 127
#note nizam is probably too crazy, especially given that last play. it felt like nizam was far more points than any other reasonable move, but tamping kills the sim, setting up a great spot with the Z and reaching deeper into the pool with two blanks unseen.

#note it's not looking that great, I need to create a new lane. BIT works too
>Marilyn_Murray: AER 3L RA.E +36 242
#note she hesitated a lot before doing this, I figured she had a bad leave.
>JD: EENNSTU C9 .NTUNE +18 198
#note a bonus of this play is that she might challenge. the top-simming play of ENS is not a realistic choice.

#note there's the lucky break I needed
>Marilyn_Murray: GU D1 GU. +9 277
>JD: AEIMORT 14F MA +22 322
#note this is a pretty bad play. I was too paranoid. the board is fairly open. MOIRA seems like bad news, but there are lanes and I'm not that up far so I might as well dig into the bag myself and try to outrun if she does bingo.

>JD: AEIORRT A10 .ATIER +21 343
#note this was the safest play that turns a bunch of tiles over. fishing is a bad idea here!
>Marilyn_Murray: CEKNS 11I SNECK +29 324
#note she didn't give herself enough of a chance with this play. some kind of fish is a good idea. she ended up drawing the blank.
>JD: CIILNOR O5 IRONIC +28 371
#note the star play is COLIC, which takes out CODEX.
