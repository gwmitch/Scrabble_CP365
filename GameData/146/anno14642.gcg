#note 2013 Arden Cup, Round 18.  
>Darin_True: ISTUZ 10E TZU.IS +37 37
#note Underscored by two.
>Charles_Reinke: CEIMNUY -  +0 12
#note Didn't remember this variant spelling of TSURIS, so I challenged.

#note Couldn't remember if it was MEINY or MEINIE (it's both) but I should at least have seen 13C MINCY.  
>Darin_True: IPRTW 12A TWIRP +26 111
>Charles_Reinke: EHIMNNU A9 HUN.MEN +36 83
#note It's foolish to play a phony here.  But it didn't even occur to me that I was playing one, and this is better than any real play available.  HUNTSMEN is good, which is probably the source of my confusion.

>Charles_Reinke: EEEFOQT 4A Q. +21 237
#note I wanted to dump the Q here because my prospects for playing it off later weren't looking great.  But A1 FEET for 30 is probably too many points to pass up.
>Darin_True: ?AELNRT L5 p.TERNAL +66 244
#note Lucky that with this great rack, there aren't any places to score big with it.
>Charles_Reinke: EEEFOTU K11 FEE +24 261
#note Sad that FOUETTE, my chance to really fix this rack, got blocked.  
>Darin_True: CHKS 8K H.CKS +42 286
>Charles_Reinke: DEEORTU 3B .ETOURED +76 337
#note None of my bingos this game have resulted from any kind of rack-grooming, just fortunate draws.
>Darin_True: FO H1 FO. +18 304
>Charles_Reinke: EEIOTVV 14I VOTIVE +35 372
#note For once, I'm not sad about the doubled V's.  This play blocks row 14, as well as column O, very well.
>Darin_True: BGO C5 BOG +21 325
#note This play takes care of column D for me.
>Charles_Reinke: AEGLOOW 1E WOO. +10 382
#note Now I'm scared of row 1 and column E bingos, so I block.  At this point, the only placed to bingo is row 15 starting with NE- or NI-.  However, I was blind to that spot, so I though this play was shutting things down totally.  Quackle seems to prefer going for points with 4D OW, probably because it knows that I can't block all possible bingos.
>Darin_True: D 6B ..D +6 331
>Charles_Reinke: AEGGILS N2 AGGI. +14 396
#note I didn't know if ARILLATE takes a D (it doesn't), so I block his O1 URANIDES.  Fortunately, he doesn't have any bingos on row 15, because I wasn't even considering that spot.  O10 LIGASE is best; it even outruns URANIDES, but I didn't see it.
