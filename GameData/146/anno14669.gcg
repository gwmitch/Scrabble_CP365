#note Round 8. ADS isn't strong enough as a leave to justify playing short with GOUT.  Q agrees - this is best.
>Mike_Early: AABEM E6 AM.EBA +20 20
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEIOR 12B CODE +25 43
#note Given that my only counter is a C, my priority is to take out the E back hook on row 12.  This sims way down the list, but in reality that's deceiving - Q indicates that even the 10th choice wins within 1% and sims within 2-1/2 points of the sim winner.  Anything's pretty much as good as anything, and it really comes down to your own preference.
>Mike_Early: ADIQS F2 QAIDS +41 61
>Jim_Burlant: EEFILOR 13C FE +23 66
#note Reasonable play, but not best.  Q likes D2 FORELEG best, and says that if I missed that, I should have played something like LIEF at G1.  After a few hundred iterations the sim starts sorting itself out and this becomes the bronze medalist.  44% to win, but not for long:

>Jim_Burlant: EEEILOR -OEE +0 66
#note  This mistake was caused because I let myself get sucked into Mike's warp-speed game.  I had barely taken a look at my rack when he was already slapping his bingo down, and I didn't take the time to look at the board.  There is no reason to exchange here; EELIER or OILIER score 22 at 4C.  And if I want to live dangerously, F10 EERIE scores 25.  And if I play on row 4, he probably plays for 23 instead of 42 on his next turn.  The 4C plays win approximately 14%, and this wins roughly 11.

>Jim_Burlant: AEEILNR J3 .REENAIL +62 128
#note Well, that worked out.  Sort of.  But if I play EELIER/OILIER like I should have on the previous turn,I'm sitting on more vowels and probably not bingoing.    
>Mike_Early: EIWZ L1 WI.ZE +42 225

#note Yay, I finally got one right!  
>Mike_Early: AEINPTU I9 PETUNIA +72 297
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEOPRR 14G PR.ORAtE +72 233
#note Nothing plays on row 15.  The only two bingos that play are this or AIRPOWER.  5% to win.
>Mike_Early: DELRSTU M5 STRUDEL +63 360
#note Mike said post-mortem he chickened out on LUSTRED and couldn't think of RUSTLED.  Not that it really matters given my deficit, but this at least helped me save a smidgen of spread. 
>Jim_Burlant: EJKLNNR 8L J.NK +69 302
#note Hmmm. This wins the sim but the runner up is a very interesting choice:  JUN for 18.  It wins almost as much as this, but whatever - I'm barely 4% to win.

#note Best.

>Jim_Burlant: AEINRSY N1 .Y +14 332
#note I was hoping on hope that the C column would stay open one turn longer and that I could at least get the miracle bingo, but I should have reconsidered.  Even Quackle, which almost always wants you to fish for the bingo that won't play, says I should just throw in the towel with YIN F10.

#note As usual when playing Mike, my tracking was a mess and I was running out of time.  I thought he was setting up XI with OOT (see comment about bad tracking) so blocking that was my priority.  Best looks to be ULANS F8 to set up a NEUK/NUKE out if he misses his out play.

#note Time penalty:  -30.  Final score recorded as 368 - 487.  The shame of this is that, with one glaring exception, I played a reasonable game until time trouble caused me to make the wrong play in the end game and punt my out in two.  What we'll never know, though:  how does this game progress if I play EELIER/OILIER?
