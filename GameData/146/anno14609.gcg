#note Terrible play. ETUDE is best, for 20. Thisis waaaaaaay down. I still fish too much.

#note More mistakes Quack likes the fish here, (AXE)D is best. Didn't realize AEPNRT was that good.

#note Quackle likesthe fish here, but I want to score. THe duck suggess 13E GEY as best, but thatdoesn't domuch for me. I have one lane open, and it's a pretty bad lane at that, so I figure i can open a lane for the blank.

#note I think this is where I lose. He shuts down, and I throw open random lanes, trying to fish, and badly at that.
>Amalan_Iyengar: ?IKMTYZ -MKY +0 189
#note Y(U)K is best, and thisexchange is really bad. I should score at least some points, but the highest scoring playi cansee is 15. YUK kind of opens a lane for me, which I desparately need, since I have the M.

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?AINTYZ 3L AYIN +17 206
#note and here, i throw open th board naively, again T(R)Y is best according to sim, but i need to open the board, just not the way I did it. I have good tiles, and a high scoring bingo waiting, pretty much in most tiles I draw.

#note According to quackle, my play is best. However, I disagree. ZA opens a lane that his hard for him to stop, and if he stops it, he'll probably open another lane. It scores a lot, keeps a great leave. I considrered it, but I chickened out on ACRED.

#note TESSERA is best, obviously. THat's just out of my range. JOE is next, not sure why, then JOES

>Amalan_Iyengar: ?ERSTTY H1 Ya +19 262
#note So Matt and I discussed this after, and Ta may have been better, since it gives me two good lanes, which arehard to block. Ya gives me 2% win percent, Ta gives me .27. Ya sims best
