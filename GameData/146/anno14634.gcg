>Lisa_Odom: ?NNOSTU D1 SNOUTiN. +68 88
>Charles_Reinke: BELOTVY -  +0 79
#note Thought it was only SNOUTED.  One of many horrible word-knowledge breakdowns of the tournament.
>Lisa_Odom: JTU 1A JUT. +33 121
>Charles_Reinke: BELOTVY E8 .OVELY +24 103
#note 2B TONEY for 38 is worth it despite the unsightly BLV leave.  3C LOOBY/BOOTY are also much better.  This play is not very good.

>Lisa_Odom: AGO C13 AGO +27 174
>Charles_Reinke: AAEEENT 5K AE +17 141
#note Pretty good leave, but this board is not friendly to bingos.  5I CEE doesn't block the S hook on GRAPH, but also takes out the J6 hotspot.
>Lisa_Odom: IKM 2B MI.K +30 204

#note 3C COAL.  
>Lisa_Odom: PRW 6G PR.W +17 221
>Charles_Reinke: AEELNTT F11 TAEL +20 181
#note K4 PALET is nice to open the board a little bit.  
>Lisa_Odom: DEITW 5A WIT.ED +20 241
>Charles_Reinke: EFFNSTY B4 F.FTY +22 203
#note The leave after this play is good, but I don't possess any letter that plays at A8.  Quackle likes A5 WYTE, which is totally unintuitive for me, but it makes sense: if I draw one of the six unseen I's, I can hit 15F SNIFF for 39.
>Lisa_Odom: I 7A I. +2 243
#note Lisa must have been very paranoid about that spot.
>Charles_Reinke: ENOQRSU 15F SUQ +41 244
#note A7 ION.  The EQRSU leave plays nice with all the unseen vowels, and I can most likely play SUQ next turn if the draw doesn't work out.
>Lisa_Odom: DET 3L TED +14 257
>Charles_Reinke: EEENNOR A7 .ON +24 268
#note Now that I'm back in the game, N1 REDONE seems stupid, especially since it seems like she's fishing.
>Lisa_Odom: DIRS I12 RIDS +19 276
>Charles_Reinke: AEEENOR 1F .EE +15 283
#note In my scorekeeping, 268 plus 15 inexplicably equals 273.  This error never got corrected.
>Lisa_Odom: DHO 2M HOD +25 301
>Charles_Reinke: AAENORX 15A OX. +30 313
#note Too bad that ADNEXA got blocked.
>Lisa_Odom: IU 14I .UI +6 307
>Charles_Reinke: AAAEINR 14B A.. +26 339
#note 12I RAIA forces her to bingo ending in a S, rather than just sticking an I on top of RIDS.  
>Lisa_Odom: R H8 .R +2 309
>Charles_Reinke: AAEIMNR 10G ANIMA +16 355
#note  I spent most of my plentiful remaining clock time on this turn but couldn't come up with 11E ETAMINE, which wins every time.  This loses if she has AEIINR? (GRAINIER, BRAINIER, or AIRLINE), or AIINRV? (ARRIVING).
>Lisa_Odom: ?AIINRV 12H A.RIVINg +72 381
#note I was given multiple opportunities to win this game, but I could never take advantage.  Probably the most disappointing loss of the tournament.
