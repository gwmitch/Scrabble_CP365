#note This is a bad play. My mentality here was: must not give hooks to the double or double-letter scores up. I thus passed up ROVE and ROVEN, among other things. I'm not sure why I was thinking this way. Part of it may be that racks with one high-scoring tile and no play to the DLS don't come up to often, so that I was confused by this situation. Hm.

#note COUSIN sims better, which makes a ton of sense. I figured EI < U + 3 points, but totally forgot to check the pool. Keeping two vowels is great here.
