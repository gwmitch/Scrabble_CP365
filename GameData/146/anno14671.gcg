>Jim_Burlant: ?AEHOOY 8D HOOEY +30 30
#note A little bit of a surprising result - I looked at this and thought I should have played YAHOO keeping the E, but Q says HOOEY is best.
>Darrell_Day: DLLO 9G DOLL +18 18
>Jim_Burlant: ?ACMNUW 7C MAW +21 51
#note Or MAWN in the same place for 24.  Either one is as good as the other.  
>Darrell_Day: BMS E7 ..MBS +24 42
>Jim_Burlant: ?CDENRU J4 UNCuR.ED +68 119
#note Slightly better to place the blank at J4 instead of J7, but  UNCURLED is the highest scoring bingo I have.  Other options are 11B CENSURED, and the slick G6 CR(ED)ENDUM.  77% to win.
>Darrell_Day: AAEGLNT 4G ANG.LATE +70 112
#note Only bingo for Darrell.
>Jim_Burlant: ADIJOQW O1 QAID +61 180
#note Best play - treading water at 74% to win.
>Darrell_Day: BDEEIUZ -  +0 112
#note Lost challenge.
>Jim_Burlant: AIJOOWX H1 JOI. +33 213
#note Best - 5E JOW and C3 AXIOM are also strong choices.  I was figuring I'd play something like WAX on the next turn.
>Darrell_Day: BDEIN 8J .EBIND +36 148
>Jim_Burlant: AEHOOWX 5D HOAX +37 250
#note While AXE scores 41 at 7L, and HOAX scores 39 at K10, I chose this because it set up the W for an easy dump on the next turn.  Q agrees - this is best.  90% to win.  
>Darrell_Day: ?AEILST O8 .ILATErS +77 225
#note 3B LISTERIA scores 79.
>Jim_Burlant: EFIIOVW 4A FIVE +38 288
#note I would normally unload the W before the F, but there were still a lot of E's out and I was obsessed with the WE/AXE play I'd set up for myself a couple of turns back.  A 4A play was definitely the call, though Q says WIVE was the play.  Maybe if I'd unloaded the W on this turn, I wouldn't have made the mistake I was about to make on the next turn.  Still in the driver's seat at 72% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: CEIORVW 14J CORVE. +32 320
>Jim_Burlant: CEIORVW --  -32 288
#note This was the fourth game of the morning session, and due to a glitch in the pairings, this game started roughly 45 minutes later than it should have.  I was getting hungry, tired, and I confused the blank with the E sitting above it.  So, instead of playing CORVEE (which is what I thought I was putting down) I played CORVEr*, which Darrell insta-challenged.  I was shocked that he would challenge a word I knew was good until he typed it into the machine, at which point I realized my mistake and told him to not bother with the challenge.   VOICER or COWIER on row 14 should have been the play.  VOICER or COWIER win over 80% and leave Darrell in serious trouble; needlessly pissing away a turn with a completely avoidable error wins 55 and still keeps him alive.
>Darrell_Day: AIIKNST 13I KAINIT. +32 287
#note This was Darrell's rack.  Q wants him to fish with 7M KI, but the problem with that is he knows my rack, and he knows if he does that I'm going to shut down rows 13, 14, and 15 and shut down row 2 on the next turn.
>Jim_Burlant: CEIORVW 6F WE +36 324
#note At least I finally get my WE play.  This is best - 5J NOW also worth consideration.
>Darrell_Day: OSTT 5L TOTS +25 312
>Jim_Burlant: CINORUV 14F COVIN +28 352
#note What's the threat?  ZOARIA or ZOYSIA at 2J?  A 60-point row 2 bingo?  Or a bingo on rows 14 or 15?  I looked for a 2J play and whiffed on VICUNA.  Truth be told, had I found VICUNA I'd have put that down.  Having said that, this is still a very strong consolation prize.  It scores well, unloads the V, kills rows 14 and 15, and gives absolutely nothing back.  
>Darrell_Day: AEGU D11 AGUE +12 324
>Jim_Burlant: EGPRRRU 2D REGR.UP +20 372
#note Yikes!  I took a long time here.  I was sure he was setting up ZEPS 15A.  I don't have a good play to stop that, as anything I can put down either leaves me with too many R's, or gives back something even worse.  However, I can unload the garbage, kill both bingos and ZOARIA/ZOYSIA on row 2, and score 20, which should hopefully keep me close enough to weather the impending Z play.  I was stunned when I saw my next rack.  
>Darrell_Day: EEEIRRS K10 RER.SE +31 355
>Jim_Burlant: ANOPRYZ C9 ZAP +29 401
#note Shocked to see the Z as the first tile I picked out of the bag.  As for this pitiful play, see previous comment about late-morning fatigue.  This wins.  But, tired or not, there's no excuse for missing my best play:  ZANY C11 56.  This sucks.  Nothing like blowing 31 points of spread.
