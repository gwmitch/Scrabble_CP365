#note It's just HOOKY.  Go figure.  I always spelled it the other way when I was a kid!  I guess I should've stayed in school and learned to spell it.  Or something.

>Ryan_Fischer: AACEIQU -  +0 278
#note Foolishly, as I had a guaranteed 88 points if I didn't as opposed to only a guaranteed 48 with a possible counter if I was wrong.

#note Sigh, that's quite a swing.  He'd still have the blank, though, so nothing I could do about that one.

#note 2F WE 29 is Champ's choice 'cause of all the Es.  COGWAY is interesting of note.  YUC(A) for 18 cleans up a bit.

#note I don't understand certain situations where the game is close in the end and my opponent makes some huge play emptying the bag, and comes out with a win.  It just doesn't make sense to me after prevailing logic says to leave one in the bag.  Someone 'splain?  Champ says VENUE is the best play, still losing.  I played this leaving DEUCE, forgetting he'd just play off of FEODS anyway if I blocked his GREISEN.
