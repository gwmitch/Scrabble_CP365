#note The board is not bingo friendly, but OVA or OVAL in the same spot achieves the same goal with a better leave.

#note This doesn't really open up any good bingo lines and those lines are easily blocked with plays on row 1.  Quackle likes 13A ILLS, but Scott will never let me triple-triple, as that's the only way I can realistically come back from this deficit.  I think I like H10 DISTIL.
>Scott_Jackson: AFT 1A FAT +23 344
>Charles_Reinke: ?DENOST 13B DOSE +21 221
#note TENSIONED or SECTIONED at H7.  I looked for nines, but didn't have as much time as I would have liked.  At least I give myself two lanes with this play, but I ruin my great rack in the process.

#note B13 DUH to open up a third lane.

#note Less than a minute on my clock now.  I was having time management problems all tournament.  My tracking was screwed up, so I thought there were more I's in the bag than there actually were, so that's why I exchanged the I.
