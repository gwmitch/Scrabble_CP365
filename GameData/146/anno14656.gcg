#description Nigel Richards plays Jesse Day in Round 22 at the 2011 NSC
>Nigel: AJSTTVY H8 VASTY +30 30
#note I felt pretty good going into this game. I suppose part of it was that I had already beaten him the day before.
>Jesse: ABFHIKN 11D BHAK.I +30 30
>Nigel: DEEGJNT 12C JEED +40 70
>Jesse: AAEFNOP 13B FOE +35 65
>Nigel: GGNNQTU 14C GNU +21 91
#note at the time I couldn't tell if he had a great leave or a bad one. it turns out that he played this more defensively than anything - trying to prevent me from killing him on row 14, and still leaving a spot for the Q, although he does give me the triple.
>Jesse: AAEHNPX 15E HEAP +32 97
#note and then sadly I missed hapax. the annotator pointed it out to me after the game. one of my biggest misses of the tournament.
>Nigel: FGNOQRT 9G Q.T +23 114
>Jesse: ACDLNXY I13 DAY +22 119
#note in retrospect, I like quackle's suggestion of CAY better than this. rather than giving him an easy spot and making a play that looks a little conspicuously like a setup, playing CAY leaves a chance that he will play from the C and set up a big X play for me.
>Nigel: FGINORR J12 FOR +15 129
>Jesse: ACELNTX K10 EXACT +42 161
>Nigel: EGIINNR L4 GINNIER +70 199
>Jesse: ELLMNOT M9 MELTON +32 193
>Nigel: DEERRSS J4 REDRESS +83 282
>Jesse: ?ALORTU 5C ROsULAT. +64 257
#note looked and looked for something else, but nothing really any better. outglare is a better play.
>Nigel: ADEILOV C2 OVE.LAID +80 362
#note the man plays many bingos
>Jesse: GIIINTW 3A WI.ING +13 270
#note I was already way low on time by this point. wasn't sure what else to do - at least I set up a lane and turn over some tiles to aim for the blank. my winning chances are already ~1%
>Nigel: CELNPRU N8 CUR +19 381
#note nigel playing some nice defense here!
>Jesse: ?AIMOTU K2 TUI +7 277
#note too low on time to come up with a good option, but I think this was actually a decent enough try. quackle's preference of AUTO at 2F leaves no possible draws that hit the W and an easy block. I could draw into WOMANIZE for 116 or another bingo there and at least make things close, especially if he doesn't have an E and has to find a way to block.
>Nigel: EILNOPW 6F POW +31 412
#note my last play probably signals the blank, but he must have calculated that he didn't need to block. coincidentally I have no bingoes in the bag that play through the W...think he saw it?
>Jesse: ?AIMOOS 2H AMO.IOnS +72 349
#note lucky to have anything
>Nigel: ABEEILN 1G ABELE +43 455
>Jesse: Z F11 ..Z +13 362
>Jesse:  (IN) +4 366
