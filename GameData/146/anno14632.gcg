#note Maybe ROUGE or ROGUE in the same spot, but I liked the EE leave better than EI.  I guess IE sets me up for -IER or -ITE words.

#note If I had realized I could play the same letters for the same amount of points, I would have played 5G ADAGIO to avoid creating a J hotspot.

>Charles_Reinke: ?BDEIPZ 5B BaP.IZED +71 294
#note With the board becoming somewhat shut-down, I decided to bingo right away instead of taking something like H1 ZED keeping the blank.  Quackle likes 4D DUB, which I didn't see.  It keeps ZED for next turn as well as retaining the P for POI on row 1.
>Andrew_Solomon: MOO N12 .OMO +32 287
>Charles_Reinke: ACDNOUW 6H NOW +19 313
#note Now I'm mostly concerned about the Q, so I'm going to keep the U.  I think I played this over DOW due to some misguided idea of hitting REDDEN on column H.
>Andrew_Solomon: DI L12 .ID +7 294
>Charles_Reinke: ACDELNU 14J CA. +12 325
#note Really wanted to do M1 CADRE, but no way am I letting that new lane stay open.  Again, keeping the U as Q insurance.  My 30 point lead after this play seems safe since there is nowhere to score on this board.
>Andrew_Solomon: ATU 2A UTA +13 307
>Charles_Reinke: CDEELNU 1A NUDE +32 357
#note Andrew sighed after drawing his tiles, making me think he just drew the Q after playing off his U.  Thus, I play my own U off with confidence. H1 LED is actually the better play since it blocks stuff like KINARAS (Andrew could be faking his post-draw sadness, which would actually be smart since apparently I would fall for it).
>Andrew_Solomon: IQ 5K QI +26 333
>Charles_Reinke: CEKLR B8 ..K +17 374
#note All I need to do is not phony, and I win.  That's why I didn't play NECKER (wasn't 100% on it), but it doesn't excuse missing ZEK.
