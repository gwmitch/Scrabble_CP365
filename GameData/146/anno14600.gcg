#note A sim ranks HSS as the best keep here. This is somewhat intuitive as it's a good scoring leave, and somewhat not because of the lack of open vowels on this board.

#note Maybe CORIA is better...I never would have played it because I was sure it was phony. I actually challenged it against Kolton in the Late Bird and then figured it was Collins because there was no way it was TWL! CORIUMS* is the plural of CORIUM! hehe
>Chris_Williams: OX I12 OX +37 114
>whatnoloan: AEHPQRS M9 HEARS +42 98
#note I should exchange Q. Points tempted me too much here. Exchanging the Q leaves HEARS for next turn if I have nothing better, tends to give me a bingo if he takes my row M scoring spot, and works okay with other stuff on the board. HEARS opens up a scoring spot for Chris and still leaves me with no current hope for the Q. 
>Chris_Williams: AEGKLNR 11D ENLARG. +27 141
#note He down RANKL(E) first so this was his rack. REG(E)N(TA)L looks like a better play here. 
>whatnoloan: ?HIIPQT 12A PITH +34 132
#note QoPH is also available here. PITH keeps the blank though which is really good, and I might even get a QuI play on row B next turn. Actually QoPH is strengthened because K works better with the P than with the Q. I'm really not sure about this play. QoPH makes the game tough if he gets an immediate play to the Q, and also makes row N extremely important, and likely makes the esses important too. Row N is already important but after PITH I think I have the advantage with regard to that area of the board.

#note I missed a really cool play here: SODOM 15K. There might be a case to be made for DOM or OM but I don't quite see it right now. ADJOS looks good on this board but not that good because HEARSED can be played by Chris often and block most of my potential.

>Chris_Williams: AEINNRU 2B ANEURIN +70 350
>whatnoloan: ADGIOPY 1A APOD +38 361
#note The goal here is not to draw the Q and block the QU play on row E. PAID is possible but with IOO in the pool and APOD scoring more points, and with plays on row 3 by him often setting up a good score for me (DEER, DEED, DEWY, DEVA), this seems correct.
