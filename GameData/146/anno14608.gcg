#note Chris's actual rack, which we talked about for a bit after the game. I didn't like his play at first, but then understood more the reasoning behind it. It's a nice play!

#note Interesting play. I thought about BOW, YOW, and WIRY. Other options are BUOY, BURY, and OW. I liked this because it seemed like Chris was a bit fishy lately. That means I'm more likely to get a big play along column H, while I keep the Y for row 12. It's a tough call though. I think his racks are more bingo-prone than average, but probably not that much more. It may be right just to go for a row 12 play.

#note There are many plays better than this. Best is to play INNS C6 or FICO C1.
