#note I know IMPHEE, didn't know its anagram HEMPIE.

#note Sad that PETTIFOG got blocked, but at least I can still bingo.  9C FOP, in hopes of getting a higher-scoring bingo next turn, is something I didn't consider, but the board is already very unfriendly to bingos and Rob could easily shut it down completely.
>Rob_Robinsky: CFO H1 CO.F +39 186
>Charles_Reinke: AADINRT C6 RADIANT +74 178
#note Spent a while lamenting my unplayable bingo until I remembered that JINNI takes a D.  That would have been a catastrophic miss.

>Rob_Robinsky: HOT B2 HO.T +28 430
>Charles_Reinke: AEENRSZ E11 ZE. +24 419
#note I have two bingo lanes on rows 14 and 11.  The pool is not terrible, save the W and X.  AENRS is a great leave to fish to.  I think this is the right play.
>Rob_Robinsky: BO 2F BO. +26 456
>Charles_Reinke: AENORSW H11 RESOW +36 455
#note More endgame collapses.  OWSEN wins.  I'm pretty sure I had at least two minutes left on my clock, enough time for me to reasonably see it.
>Rob_Robinsky: EILRRUX 14G R.UX +29 485
>Charles_Reinke: AN F10 NA +15 470
#note Only consolation is OLEANDER was cowinner of the high ARDEN word of the tournament.  So I actually won ten bucks this game despite totally blowing it.
