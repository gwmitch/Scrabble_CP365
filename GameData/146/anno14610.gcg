#note Knew I missed a couple here. (R)AMpIKES, (R)AMEKInS and KE(R)AMICS. But my thought process was that I'm kind of desperate after this play, but I know he'll block the 2x2 through the A if I don't play there, so I'll subtly open the 2x2 through AR and hope for the best. I swear.
>Glenn_Dunlop: AXZ C1 ZAX +60 272
#note Well whaddyaknow, this is frustrating. Time for a desperation play. Find the only bingo available for me next turn and you deserve a cookie! No cheating!
