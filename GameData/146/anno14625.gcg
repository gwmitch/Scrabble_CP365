>Charles_Reinke: BEEFINO H7 FOB +16 16
#note 2013 Arden Cup, Round 2.  Spent a long time deciding between this and FEEB.  This contributes to my time trouble later in the game.
>Lisa_Odom: DIY G6 YID +17 17
>Charles_Reinke: EEGHINO I8 NEIGH +19 35
#note Again,  I took forever on this turn.  NEIGH is the highest-scoring play available, but I8 GIEN forks the board equally well while keeping a better leave.
>Lisa_Odom: EILNOSU 13F ELUSION +70 87
>Charles_Reinke: EIIORWY 12K YOWIE +33 68
>Lisa_Odom: ABDKN O8 BANK.D +39 126
>Charles_Reinke: EIINRTX 14F XI +52 120
>Lisa_Odom: ?AEEOSV N2 OVErSEA +76 202
>Charles_Reinke: AEINRTT 15G NITRATE +77 197
>Lisa_Odom: ELTW J7 WELT +23 225
#note Scored as 21.
>Charles_Reinke: EIIOSUV M9 VIE.S +46 243
#note No point in hoarding the S, since it doesn't go anywhere.
>Lisa_Odom: EGNORT 12A TONGER +26 251
>Charles_Reinke: AADIORU K3 AUDIO +17 260
#note Forwent A8 AUDITOR because of the cheap S hook, but it is probably smart to block the triple-triple lane - DATURA does that.
>Lisa_Odom: AQRU A8 QUAR. +42 293
#note Overscored by 6!  Need to start counting my opponent's plays.
>Charles_Reinke: ?AAHMOR E5 AMpHORA. +98 358
>Lisa_Odom: CIS A8 .....ICS +57 350
#note Should have blocked column A when I had the chance.
>Charles_Reinke: DJLLOPR 4J P.LL.D +22 380
#note In no hurry to play my J, but if I had seen 15A SLOJD I would have played it.  I disliked giving up my D for DWELT at J6.
>Lisa_Odom: AMP D4 PAM +22 372
#note Overscored by 1.  This play does a great job of locking down the top-left corner of the board.
>Charles_Reinke: CFGJORT C9 FRO.T +24 404
#note Spent most of my remaining time deciding between this and C3 JO. In the end, the leave of CFGRT just seemed extremely unlikely to give me an out-in-two, so I went with this.
>Lisa_Odom: AEENRTU L2 RE.ENT +19 391
>Charles_Reinke: CEGJZ 4B ZE. +14 418
#note GYOZA wins.  Maybe given unlimited time I would have seen it, but then again, probably not.  
>Lisa_Odom: AU 10A .U.A. +7 398
>Lisa_Odom:  (CGJ) +26 424
