>Amalan_Iyengar: CDFHLSZ -CDFHL +0 0
#note This was a pretty tough turn. For bingoing, I think holding CHS is best, as does quackle, but I figure I can score a lot next turn and have bingo tiles in a turn or two. Not sue about this play.

>Amalan_Iyengar: ABELOSZ I7 Z.AL +24 24
#note Quackle lieks ZEE best, then BLAZES, then ZEAL. I'm not sue why it prefers ABLOS to BEOS, but I think BLAZES is best,  since it just scoresa lot of points.

#note Missed the L8 spo entirely. FAME scored, but it was a very very volatile play, with a decent leave. FAENA is bes.

#note Of course I draw EST? into AIN, and then miss the best playthat's staring me into the face. ETAMINS M3 is best.

#note quackle wants me to fish, with DR(AW). I agree. What I should do is score a bit, with  a great leave, and force her to open, and when she does, hit her with a bingo.
