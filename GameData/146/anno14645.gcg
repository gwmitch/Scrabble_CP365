#note I made this play too fast. for all that it leaves me with a nice leave it also opens the board way too much. taking the points for faena (which I didn't see) makes sense.

#note I guess I could've done something that closes the board more. but this seems fine.

#note this was a total stee moment. I at least identified that the bag was ugly and the only real threat was the big X play. But then I looked at it for a bit and couldn't find a good block and gave up and played elsewhere. steeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. just playing SEI looks great if I have bingo aspirations. URAEI looks just fine too. good thing I was up a lot anyway.
