#note Fail. This was the first game of the morning, the caffeine had not kicked in, and I had not quite woken up yet.  Because of that, anything more complex than finding a SATIRE 7 was probably beyond what my half-dead brain could handle.  I convinced myself that AWHILE was no good, and I never saw 9E WHA.  This is pathetic.

#note Q wants me to play HEINIE on row 11 for 4 more and says this is an 11-point dog.

#note Sam told me he had a bingo that he passed up:  EXTRUDE, but I'm not sure what the blank was.
>Jim_Burlant: EIINNUY I8 YIN +19 58
#note As I put this down I felt like I was watching my own funeral procession.  I don't have the tiles to fork the board, the board is going to shut down, and I'm still stuck with EINU.  The sim confirms there are no really good options here, and that it's either this or 11F ENNUI.  I considered 11A NIXIE but couldn't justify the points given the INUY leave.  Given how my unnecessary exchanges went this tournament, perhaps I should have made another unnecessary exchange on this turn?  No matter what I put down, this game was over by the next turn.

>Jim_Burlant: EIINOQU F11 QUIN. +15 73
#note I wondered if I should fish with something like OI 14E to build a rack around EINQU but figured the board would shut down too quickly.    Predictably, Quackle, which is enamored of QU, hates this.  The duck says my best play is 10G WINO, which  wins 6%.  This wins 3-1/2, and my next draw doesn't help any.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: EIV H12 VIE. +11 187
#note >Jim_Burlant: EEIOOOY -EIOOOY +0 73
#note A little bit of a surprise.  Exchanging is obviously indicated, though Q says I should also keep OY to go with my E.  Counterintuitive to be sure, but given the hot spot at 10B, keeping the Y is a good idea.  Regardless, this is getting bleaker by the turn.  3% to win.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: I 10G .I. +6 193
>Jim_Burlant: AEFKORR B8 KEF +35 108
#note Bad.  While 35 points look enticing after all the crap I've been grinding through, I missed a golden opportunity to milk the board for points.  WIN takes the back K...which was something I missed, and it leaves me an almost certain 30+ coming back next turn down the B column.  As for this - I'd normally play KAF to keep the E, but I wanted to keep the A both for the AYIN hook as well as a play down the E column.  Best looks to be J10 KOR 38.  This scores well, but like I said - I didn't optimize my leave to be synergistic with the board.
>Sam_Dick-Onuoha: CIORT J9 TORIC +20 213
>Jim_Burlant: AOPR E3 PROA +17 125
#note Didn't write this rack down entirely; I think there was another A and/or R, but I'm not sure.  Anyway, at least my having kept the A on the previous turn bore fruit.  Now I can open up the northwest.

#note Right idea, wrong execution.  Apparently I should have played the L with OLE.  Whatever, the intent was to open lines for an easy 7 since I've got a pretty good leave. Back up to 30% to win.

#note My take is that, while my first and sixth moves were well off the mark, this probably was not my game to win regardless.  Re:  the Q dump:  I don't know if this board was Q-friendly enough to fish off IO and build a rack around EINQU or if I did the right thing there by unloading the Q.  I'm not copping a plea for the WAUL misfire - there's no way I should have missed WHA, but it's very fair to say that, mistakes or not, when you're turning tiles and drawing INUY and OOOY a couple of turns apart while your opponent is following up a huge X play with a bingo that has two blanks and an S, it ain't your game.  For all intents and purposes, this game was practically over by the time I short-changed myself with KEF on turn 6.
