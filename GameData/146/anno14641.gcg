#note cuvee is the more defensive option. I wonder why I kept opting for open boards.

#note tons of options to choose between here. I think just playing ZA looks optimal.

#note colloid is a lot more points and also opens a nice new lane. too bad I didn't see it.

#note in spite of being able to score 6 more by playing ZOOM, keeping the M makes me twice as likely to bingo (7% to 17%).

#note PISO kills the sim. it gets me in range, takes away cheap points from her and bingoes more than any other move (there are some lanes lurking). I do like the surreptitious lane for my P that I create at 13H though.

#note I thought this was a reasonable try at stealing the game even though quackle hates it, maybe too obvious though
