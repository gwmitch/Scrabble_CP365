>Steve: ?INRSTU 8D RUSTINg +64 64
#note One of a thousand bingos. I chose this ultimately over NITROUS, since it didn't leave a vowel next to a dls, and also because I thought I could later take advantage of the T front hook.
>Chuck: EEGIRTU I6 GE.ITURE +62 62
#note Chuck used all of two seconds on his clock to make this play.
>Steve: CDEFGIO 12G FI.EDOG +26 90
#note This placement scores two more points than playing in the D column.  But for all my genius I was disappointed in missing the C hook. DOH. COIFED in column C scores nine more points, and is six points better in equity.
>Chuck: OVX 7C VOX +28 90
>Steve: AACIIPV M10 VA.I +16 106
#note I vacillated between this and VIGIA. Thought of VAGIC*, too, but wasn't sure of it being good.
>Chuck: AANQ G4 QANA. +15 105
>Steve: ACEILNP H1 PLAIN +38 144
#note I saw two of the three bingos in the rack, but naturally the one I didn't see is the only one that played. Looked for a nine, and not surprised I missed it. That would have been beautiful. There's also a better play in the same spot. My play is fifth best.
>Chuck: MNTY H11 M.NTY +36 141
>Steve: CEEENOT 14K ONCE +23 167
>Steve: CEEENOT --  -23 144
#note Thought I'd give it a chance. I liked that I had one of the few Ts left, and was trying to set it up.
>Chuck: IKO 2F KI.O +18 159
>Steve: CEEENOT G12 .OE +13 157
>Chuck: AABIZ 3B BAIZA +38 197
#note Missing the elegant ZAIBAI(ONE)! Both plays score the same.
>Steve: CCEENPT 4A CENT +28 185
>Chuck: ELY F13 LYE +32 229
>Steve: CEEINTW 3H .WE +19 204
>Chuck: EFHISS 1A FISHES +55 284
>Steve: CEINPTW 11L W.P +13 217
#note Desperation play.
>Chuck: EORRR K3 ERROR +17 301
#note Chuck joked he was probably making a mistake with this play. Little did he know...
>Steve: ?CEEINT O5 ENTICEs +82 299
#note Miracle draw gets me back in the game. Of course, there's two higher scoring bingos on row one.
>Chuck: OO E3 .OO +31 332
#note Beautiful play, but at what cost? Vowels are getting tight and going up in value.
>Steve: AABELRU E10 BURA +17 316
#note Came oh so close to playing CURABLE and emptying the bag. That would have been suicide. Q likes ARABL(E), which leaves one in the bag and which I flat out missed.
>Chuck: ADDDGHO F10 OH +18 350
#note This play scared me at first, until I realized I still had a play in the spot.
>Steve: AEJLMSU 10B JUM.. +32 348
#note Sometimes the obvious play isn't the best play. This is one of those times. Chuck can now win with the right sequence.
>Chuck: ADDDGLT N2 GLAD +15 365
#note He misses the winning play, which starts at 15a. 
>Steve: AELS L6 SEAL +9 357
#note I have better equity if I use two turns to go out, but was down to under 30 seconds and wanted to just assure the win. Imagine my horror when after my play we disagreed on the final score. We each had ourselves winning by two points. Luckily, it was his error, and my two point margin of victory stood up.
>Steve:  (DDT) +10 367
