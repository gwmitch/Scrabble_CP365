>George_Viebranz: EEEIILZ -EEI +0 0
#note Quackle, of course, likes ZEE in either of the three spots, but this is the next best.  I figure with this leave, it would be hard to not score well on the next play, and hopefully leave something better than EIIL.

#note DUH.  SABERING.
>Pete: EEMTUYY 2E MY +32 109
#note Q prefers YET 24.  1 fewer point, but ties up the top lane and the leave is slightly better.
>George_Viebranz: AEEGHNX 7E HEX +45 155
#note Missed EX(C)HANGE.  Pete said he liked my play better, but if I had seen this I wouldn't have thought twice.  It's easily hookable, but 40-some points is a lot to give up out of fear, even for me.
>Pete: AEESTUY 9D AYES +42 151
#note Awesome play.  Best.  
>George_Viebranz: AEGILNS 5E GENI.ALS +86 241
#note I took GENITALS over GELATINS because we were at Borders, and I thought if I was a muggle walking by, I'd like to see the word GENITALS on a Scrabble board. 
>Pete: EGOPTTU 1F PUTTO +29 180
#note Best again.
>George_Viebranz: ?AETUUV -UUV +0 241
#note Quackle likes UVEA 4A, but I stand by this one.
>Pete: ?EGJNOO 10B JOG +40 220
#note Best again.
>George_Viebranz: ?ADEFIT L5 .AFETIeD +74 315
#note Best.  I even put the blank in the right place.
>Pete: ?EINNOW 12E wINNOWE. +62 282
#note The only bingo.  I didn't know it, and I didn't know how Pete would know it, and I think I held him on it, but wisely did not challenge. 
>George_Viebranz: DILNOUW H11 I.DOW +27 342
>Pete: AEFIRRU 4A FIRE +30 312
>George_Viebranz: EILNNRU A4 .UNNEL +27 369
#note Almost did UNFINER* here.
>Pete: AEOPQRU 10J QU.P +35 347
#note Just behind EQUIP B1 (dumb) and OPAQUER, which would have been sweet. 
>George_Viebranz: ADHIMRR B10 .IHAD +32 401
#note Surprisingly far down.  Q likes HERMA or HEARD 8K, but I don't want to open anything up.  I'm definitely not crazy about an MRR leave, but seeing the other plays, I'd still do this.
>Pete: ADEEOOR C12 ODEA +24 371
>George_Viebranz: ACLMRRV 14G V.CAL +12 413
#note I was a bit afraid that Pete would have a six from 15J, but I didn't want to go into the endgame with V and C on my rack.  This scores shit, but I don't think it was a mistake.  It could have been...
>Pete: BEOORTV A12 OBOE +38 409
#note OVERT 15K is Pete's win.  It scores the same as OBOE (which is nice nonetheless), but leaves him with BO plus the E in the bag, instead of RTV plus the E in the bag.  
>George_Viebranz: AIKMRRT 15J MIKRA +22 435
>Pete: ERTV F11 R.VET +23 432
#note R(E)VET 8K is Pete's second chance, but neither of us see it.  I just studied it yesterday.  Pete goes for a hail mary.
>Pete: ERTV --  -23 409
