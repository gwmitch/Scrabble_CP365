#note i wrote about this miss on my LJ. nervousness and sudden doubting of a word that i KNOW. i thought for a split second i was confusing OBELIAS and ABELIAN and didn't think twice about it. kind of like missing ENSURED against dly cuz for a second i thought I'M MISSPELLING INSURED and didn't think again about it! i gotta focus better.

#note chris was upset about this move! what a lucky draw. but i missed a better move, that wasn't a bingo -- SILVEX! all i could think about was CONVEX and BICONVEX. [-7.5]

#note quackle doesn't like this -- it prefers M11 SKY or JOYS/JOWS for more points at L1. i definitely disagree with the latter two, why would i give up more points and another bingo lane? however, i'd probably have played SKY if i saw it, with the case S i don't have to worry now. [-8]
