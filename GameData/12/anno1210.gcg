#note It seemed worth it to take the extra points and clear this vowel heavy rack in a hurry, even though I'm giving a lot back to him.  Sim concurs.

>Dave_Koenig: ?AABEST 15C SAT.ABlE +80 150
#note Evidence that I was worn out and my mind wasn't working well.  I couldn't see my other bingos.  TABARETS 5D is best, followed by LABIATES 15C.
>Jerry_Lerman: APX I1 PAX +42 155
>Dave_Koenig: EGGLPTZ 14B LEZ +37 187
#note Sim prefers ZEP 1G to the other Z plays, though that seems to be asking for trouble to me.  In retrospect, I like ZEP 14B better than LEZ, though they sim almost identically.  But the best simming play is the nice GLUG 12D, which goes a long way to clearing out this rack, and still keeps a lot of scoring options for the Z on the next turn.

>Dave_Koenig: EGGHOPT 14J HOG +28 215
#note I saw HOGGET right away and deliberated over playing it, but I chickened out.  That's a huge loss, because it's far and away the best play here.  I blame Linda Hoggatt.  I've never even met her, but when I saw the word on my rack, I remembered in the back of my mind that there was a Scrabble player's name that was something like that.  I thought that that might be why the word was jumping out to me, even though it might not be acceptable.  Of course, HOG is much worse.  But on the good side it creates a hook for my other G.

#note Over the last couple turns, it sure felt like I was being punished for failing to play HOGGET.

>Jerry_Lerman: GLUV 11B VULG. +18 348
>Dave_Koenig: CEIOORT 12H CORTI. +26 287
#note This is phony, but I got away with it.  I was unsure during the game, but it seemed reasonable.  CORTICAL is good of course.  However, it doesn't do me too many favors on this board.  I considered the hyper-aggressive COCO 12N, but didn't think I could justify doing that with so many A's unseen and me not even having one.  I had a bias against playing on row 3, because row 2 is just about the only place I can fit bingos right now.  However COOT 3B makes a lot of sense, because it scores well, keeps a good leave, and creates the S hook to column A.  Of course, I still have to hope to draw that final S.  I would like to score and create lanes elsewhere on the board while still leaving the 2A-2G lane open, but I don't see many good options.

#note I was ready to try NERVATED* in that spot if Jerry hadn't blocked.  I knew it was phony, but from what Jerry said after the game, it seems like he would have bought it.
>Dave_Koenig: ADEERTV B1 VAT +24 329
#note Still, this is not a bad choice, since I have all the remaining front hooks for TA.
>Jerry_Lerman: ADINR B5 DINAR +16 407
#note Jerry clinches the victory with good defense.
>Dave_Koenig: AABDEER K11 A. +4 333
#note All this play does is cough up a bunch of spread.  Quack has me with 0% winning chances with every play.  Something like BAAED or DEBAR on the A column will minimize spread.  There were bingos I could draw, but he could easily block them.  So what was I thinking?  Believe it or not, I was still under the impression that CORTIC might be good, and I talked myself into thinking, "maybe it even takes the S."  So I was hoping to draw the S and get SABERED and BEADERS in two spots.  Good thing I didn't draw the S, or I would have given up even more spread.
