>Kelly: AAEEEFT -AAEEF +0 0
#note CP doesn’t care for this exchange much, wanting me to take the 14 points with FATE-8E, even with the three vowel leave. I’m becoming more and more convinced that opening plays like this have as much to do with style as objective right and wrong, and I didn’t think the risk of horrid racks for the first several turns was worth grabbing a few points. Still, keeping AET was probably better.
>Gavin_Trefoil: DILNOOU 8G DUO +8 8
>Kelly: CEOPRTU 9I PUT +15 15
#note Rack grooming is the right approach here, but CP says OP-9G is the way to go, by almost 3 percent. It’s safer, but keeps the U and gives up 2 points. I guess the lesson here is that the U isn’t a killer if you have dynamic tiles with it.

>Kelly: ?CELORT O5 EL.CTROs +77 92
#note Number 3, behind the triple-triples COvERL(E)T and COR(s)ELET, neither of which I found after a lengthy search. I’ve even seen CORSELET in books before, but, as you’ve surely noticed, anagramming ain’t my strength.

#note For once, the top option. I also considered BI(Z), but figured it would likely be there next turn, barring Quackle chicanery.
>Gavin_Trefoil: EEJNOOX 13K JEE. +40 166
#note So much for BIZ.
>Kelly: ABIIIOR G6 OI.IA +8 131
#note I’ve been noticing how one is usually better off sacking some points to clean up vowelitis all at once, rather than letting it fester turn after turn. Still, BIA(L)I-L4 scores twice as much with a reasonable leave.

>Kelly: ?BEEERW F10 WEB +30 185
#note You’d think I of all people should notice dWEEB(I)ER-M2. WEB comes in slightly behind WEBER, which I considered and rejected. I didn’t want to accelerate the end of the game with turnover, burn the awesome R, close the potential ING lane, and create a juicy S hook with three of them out. I think I was right here, but am open to rebuke.

>Kelly: ACEGIWY 2F CAGEY +41 311
#note Just behind WAGE(R)-8A. I know I sound like a stubborn, closed-minded mule this game, but I don’t see it. I’m behind, and this gets me a lot more points. Sure, the board is awfully volatile now, and IW sucks, but ICY isn’t a super leave either, and it’s not like volatility is necessarily a bad thing.

#note CP likes FUN or FAD at 5K, but do those really address the big concerns here? VEX wasn’t necessarily a fish, but seems to indicate a nice rack for old Trefoil. I can’t shut down all the bingo lanes, but it seemed like it was important to take out the A column, where high-scoring bingoes that could leave me behind too much in the endgame would most likely be played. My reasoning worked out here, but that doesn’t mean I was right. Maybe I need a tutor.
