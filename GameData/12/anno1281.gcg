#note The Quack favors DuSTiNG 4K by about half a point here.  I don't get it.

#note With two L's unseen, WALY is worth sacrificing three points.  Also interesting is DRAWN in the same place, which I considered but discarded in favor of the extra four points.
>Brian: CEIIR 1K ICIER +32 196
>Rob: AELLNRV 4H .NRAVEL +20 301
#note One of the arguments in favor of DRAWN the previous turn inspired this play.  Quackle favors VALE(T) 8N by 4 points, and also favors VELAR 6N (which I considered) over my play.  I played UNRAVEL for the turnover and to hurry the end of the game against a stronger player; had I seen VALET, the defensive value is more important than what UNRAVEL accomplishes.
>Brian: AEER N10 EA.ER +25 221
>Rob: AACELUU N3 A.ULA +7 308
#note I have no explanation for this play.  EATER has already complicated this bingo line, ALULA doesn't accomplish much of anything.  I saw ULU A3; Quackle likes shedding more vowels a bit better with EAU.
>Brian: DEILNOO 13D EIDOLON +66 287
>Rob: ACEGISU 15K GUISE +27 335
#note Quackle prefers U(M)IAC 3C in order to cash in the last S for more points and to kill a bingo line.  After EIDOLON, I felt that the Y hook was equally as dangerous and a bit more likely, given the bingo pool.  What ultimately decided me was the worst case scenario where Brian would score about 30 and clean up his rack to bingo out -- this nearly happened.  A tough choice.

#note B(A)H 3M is one point better, but I was under time pressure and didn't finish the math.  I lost ten points on time.
