>Jeremy: ?EEHIIR K3 HEREI. +18 50
#note I knew this play was weak.  I spent a long time trying to scrouge up a bingo.  HIE G2 is best by 9.8  There's no need to throw out both E's and my R for the improved shot at a bingo next.
>Lou: ABY J4 BAY +35 115
>Jeremy: ?ADDIIN 2C DAIDz.IN +65 115
#note Dang!  Quackle is hard to impress.  The best play is just L3 ID by 1.3 points.  I was proud I spotted this one.
>Lou: EGIT L2 GITE +28 143
>Jeremy: AEMOTUX 1A EXAM +58 173
#note Best.  Nothing even close.
>Lou: GLU 2L .LUG +12 155
>Jeremy: ANORTUU L8 .OURN +16 189
#note M1 ULNA for the points by 10.6 points, the OUT+R leave isn't that bad at all.  YOURN just doesn't score as much.
>Lou: LOW 3B LOW +28 183
>Jeremy: AEITUVZ 11I AZU.E +28 217
#note LUTZ by 14.5!!!  Must be important to block the S(LOW) hook with all those S's unseen.

#note I wondered if I had missed an easy bingo here.  Nope.  Got the best play too.
>Lou: EF B6 FE +30 344
>Jeremy: DENOPRT C7 PORTEND +88 490
#note Best.  PORTEND sims a tenth of a point better than PROTEND.  Why?  Who knows.  PORTEND doesn't put a vowel by the DWS.
