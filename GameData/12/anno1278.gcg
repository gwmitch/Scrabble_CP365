#note I didn't see or know AGONAL, but I prefer this play which blocks the S hook on the triple lane
>p2: AEGOSTW M5 TOWAGES +77 132
>Dave: AAELNPU L4 PUNA +25 172
#note this is 2nd best to 11B ULPAN which I completely missed
>p2: DEIJOTT 11E ID +21 153
>Dave: ABEJLNR 5K J.. +20 192
#note this is inferior to N4 or 12C JAB
>p2: DEORV N2 ROVED +45 198
>Dave: ABEILNR 8M .LB +15 207
#note I saw RUINABLE, INARABLE, BILINEAR, and RINSABLE  of course they don't play.  12A BLAIN, BAIRN, or BRAIN or M1 LAB are all better
>p2: HN 13J H.N +9 207
>Dave: AEINRRU I5 RUI. +5 212
#note this is where things start to go really bad.  Maybe 12B RUIN is best?
>p2: AXZ H4 ZAX +40 247
>Dave: AEINRRR 10M .RR +5 217
#note I couldn't remember if ORRA was good, though I thought it was and definitely should have played it
>p2: EMN O1 MEN +19 266
>Dave: ADEINPR M1 PAD +23 240
#note an unplayable bingo and he just blocked the D and P hook on ROVED
>p2: IO O8 .I.O +6 272
>Dave: EEIINQR -EIINQ +0 240
#note maybe I should have kept INER, but I was trying to maximize my chances of getting an S or the blank
>p2: ?AEISST D8 IS.lATES +71 343
#note oh.  there they are.
>Dave: CEEMORT 15A MOC. +24 264
#note I was hoping for an open I for METEROIC
>p2: EIKOOQT C8 QI +26 369
>Dave: EEGNORT B12 ERG. +10 274
#note I don't like this play at all but was trying to open another lane.  Maybe GETTER?
>p2: AEKOSTT A12 AE +8 377
>Dave: EKNOOST 5G O.. +3 277
#note I was kind of proud of this play.  I have a 25% chance (maybe lower given his last play) of drawing an E to go out with KETONES and playing the O here makes it impossible to block.
>p2: AEEILTT I11 .ITE +15 392
>Dave: EKNOSTT 14G TE. +3 280
#note This should have been BIT followed by TOKENS, but I was pretty dispirited by this point
