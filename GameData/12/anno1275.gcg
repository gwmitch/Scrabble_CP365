#note This play sims second best, which surprises me because it seemed like a huge error. I had no reason to open up that line. LIN(EOLAR) is best.

#note Ok. This is probably one of the toughest positions I've encountered in a game. I'm up 12 points. There are a couple bingo lines open and great tiles unseen. There is a notable non-bingo scoring lane (hooking LINK-S). There are 4 in the bag. So obviously, I'm worried about the bingo line in column J. But there is a lot of other stuff to consider. The LINKS spot concerns me because she can definitely win without needing a bingo. GHIS is a big 37 there. So I need to worry about bingos, nonbingos, and turnover. Ideally, I would like to play off 1-2 tiles or 6. This sets me up for a chance to go out first if it comes down to a race for that. Anyways, think about this position and decide what you would do before clicking on.
>Matthew: AELNOOT J2 ETALON +15 387
#note Firstly, Quackle gives no definitive answer. There are about a dozen plays simming between 46% and 54% chance of winning. After simming over 700 iterations on many plies, there is still no play that breaks away from the rest. ETALON is in the top 4. I like it a lot. It takes out the 7-letter bingo line. It gives her only two highly restrictive 8-letter bingo lines, it scores a significant 15 points, and it turns over six tiles. This gives me a decent chance of going out with five tiles next turn if I can draw the blank or the S. Unfortunately, it leaves LINKS open, something I was forced to concede. The other top simming plays are OLEA and TOEA at 8A, leaving the danger zone alone entirely. And LOOP at O5. LOOP is interesting; I didn't even consider making a fish play, but it was a considerable move. With LOOP, she comes down with fASHION, and I have a 30% chance of drawing into TANGLIER or another bingo. It's a decent shot.
