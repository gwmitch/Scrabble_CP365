>Pete: AEEFNRT 8H EF +10 10
#note Duck likes FEATER by .9.  I'll take my chances with EF.
>Mason_Shambach: DRY G7 DRY +19 19
>Pete: AEIMNRT J2 MINARET +74 84
#note Because I'm a schmuck, I miss the better location for three more points.
>Mason_Shambach: IO F9 OI +9 28
>Pete: DHTUVVX 5I V.V +18 102
#note with Mason fishing, I wasn't concerned with not having a decent X spot available.  VAV cleans up the 2 V's, which I found far more troublesome.  Duck disagrees, it likes TUX.  But what do you draw the next turn to DHVV to make it not suck? 
>Mason_Shambach: E I8 .E +6 34
>Pete: ?ADHTUX I1 TUX +39 141
#note He fished again.  X spot still there, and now I'm building a rack too.  If he bingoes, next turn, I have agood chance of bingoing back.  If he doesn't, I REALLY like where I am.
>Mason_Shambach: I 1H I. +6 40
>Pete: ?ADHLRS 11B HeRALDS +73 214
#note He missed again, I didn't.  I miss the cool HoLARDS for 7 more points.
>Mason_Shambach: ADEY B11 .EADY +24 64
>Pete: AAGILNS E3 AGNAILS +72 286
#note Here comes the flood. At this point, I was starting to feel bad... almost.
>Mason_Shambach: GGINNOO 12H ONGOING +73 137
>Pete: ?ACEQTU C4 CoEQUAT. +78 364
#note At this point, I was almost apologetic in putting it down.  Turns out, the non-bingo QUANT M9 is 2.1 better in equity, which makes sense.  Doesn't account for the psychic value of the bingo-bango-bongo, however.
>Mason_Shambach: INP 15A P.IN +30 167
>Pete: EKLOTTZ 6B Z.T. +33 397
#note Overvalued rack balance here... and the potential LIKE bingoes.  KETO D1 is right.
>Mason_Shambach: JO 11K JO +38 205
>Pete: EKLOOTT 13L LOOT +18 415
#note At this point, I screw up big... up 200 is a good time to mess up.  I was busy tying up the board, when I should have kept scoring,  Oh well (KOTO D1)
>Mason_Shambach: IP D3 PI +24 229
>Pete: EEKNRST L1 KERNS +38 453
#note KERNS wins the sim, KEP A13 wins the equity... I stand by my play.
>Mason_Shambach: BW 13A W.B +16 245
>Pete: ACEEEHT 1L .HET +33 486
#note CHE(GO)E N9 is the cool play that I didn't know. Duck likes KEET over my KHET, and it's probably right.
>Mason_Shambach: O 14A O. +11 256
>Pete: ACEEFUW 13G AW +12 498
#note At this point, I'm playing to keep Mason from bingoing... kind of an exercise to practice defense.  AWE does the job better,
>Mason_Shambach: EO 3L .OE +6 262
>Pete: AACEEFU 2O A +2 500
#note I took him trying to bingo personally.  Can't have that S hook there.
>Mason_Shambach: B 14M B +5 267
>Pete: ACDEEFU N12 ..AD +20 520
#note Kinda cute, and the most effective defensively... but I like the Duck's suggestion of (SOW)ED H11.  If he does bingo, it's for the minimum.
>Mason_Shambach: M N3 .M +4 271
>Pete: CEEFIUU 10L FUCI +22 542
#note Best, in all respects.
>Mason_Shambach: EEILRRS 14F RESILE +19 290
>Pete: EEU 15N .E +9 551
#note Missing (EM)EU N3.
