>Rebecca: ??LLNQS -LL +0 0
#note I figured I had a good chance of a high Q play on the next turn, even if it meant burning a blank, and then a bingo soon after.  Quackle likes QuiLL, QueLL, QuoLL, but -LL and -LLN are the next highest on 4 ply (it doesn't like them on 2 ply).
>Opponent: EHITW H4 WHITE +30 30
>Rebecca: ??INOQS 6F Qu.N +32 32
#note As I expected, I missed lots of bingoes here.  I thought Q-play plus very likely bingo on the next turn was probably better, so I didn't look very hard.  Quackle picks G6 QI 26 as the second-best choice.  It puts my play above the 69 point bingoes and below the 76 point ones.
>Opponent: OOT J4 OOT +20 50
>Rebecca: ?AEILOS K5 ISOLAtE +92 124
#note Quackle likes it best.  I think I like ISOLEAd better now, and I don't remember why I decided against it.
>Opponent: DEEGO 12H GEODE +26 76
>Rebecca: BEEFSTZ H12 .EEZ +42 166
#note Missing E2 FEZES 49 (Wasn't thinking of the hook).  Quackle likes that and 13L FEZ 35 best, but I'm not sure why the better leave from FEZ would be worth that much of a sacrifice, especially with so many E's left.
>Opponent: CMPY 9J C.MPY +17 93
>Rebecca: BFILSTU 15E FUT. +16 182  
#note Terrible move.  Lots of places where I could play FUB or FLUB for more points, and I was still not noticing the hook on QUiNTS.  I probably would have played 13B FUSIBLE 36 if I had seen it.
>Opponent: AADILRS 13B SALARI.D +79 172
>Rebecca: ABEIILS 9B BIALIES +73 255
#note Best.  Now I noticed the hook, but I couldn't use it.  I actually put down ALIBIES in the same spot first and then changed it.
>Opponent: IRTTU B6 TUR.IT +12 184
>Rebecca: CDEORRU 3I CRUOR +24 279
#note Better are A1 ORDURE 26, which I didn't know and 3I CRUDER, which I didn't think of.
>Opponent: GLRW L1 GR.WL +25 209
>Rebecca: DEEHIRT 1L .HEE +24 303
#note I would have played 1I HEDGIER 36 if I'd seen it.  1H DREIGH 33 and 1H DRIEGH 33 are also good, but I didn't know them.  Missed 14A THEIR 36 and 14B HEIR 34, which sim well, but I was worried about blocking a bingo in row 1 (Lots of N's left).
>Opponent: AGIV 14A VIGA +25 234
>Rebecca: DINPRST 7D PRIN. +21 324
#note DRIPT and DIPT in the same spot are both better, but I couldn't remember if either of them was good, and I was focused on playing off the N with so many in the bag.  10A NITRID 24 is also good.  Quackle likes E1 PRINTS 31, but that seems needlessly open at this point in the game.  
>Opponent: AEX A6 AXE +47 281
>Rebecca: ADEKSTU 12C DAK +33 357
#note Best.  I might have done TAKE for the extra point and more turnover if I'd noticed it, but I was somewhat low on time.
>Opponent: DNO 13L NOD +10 291
>Rebecca: EMNOSTU O11 OMENS +35 392
#note Had to block the obvious setup.  MENO and MENU are better, since they leave a tile in the  bag, but I was playing fast and didn't see them.
>Opponent: EJNOY 15J ENJOY. +24 315
>Rebecca: AABFTUV 14J BA +22 414
#note Missed FA for more points in the same spot.  10E AFT 31 is best.  F6 QIVIUT 20 would have been nifty.
>Opponent: IN 10E IN +10 325
>Opponent:  (FVAUT) +22 347
