>Bing: DEFINOV L2 FOVE. +22 38
#note Hmm, I thought it was close between FOVEA at L2 or N2, but I missed a play that sims well above both: OF 5K.

#note About the best I could do...this was annoying though, as James had initially put down JUN (I think), which would create a nice spot for MINIBaR. I sure hope I didn't flinch or anything.

#note FUTURE L8 looked good at first, but I was very worried about running low on vowels.
>James: EMW M13 MEW +26 302
>Bing: ELSTUVW 9B VEST +16 341
#note Fine, but sort of lucky since I somehow overlooked the biggest threat! I saw things like BLABs, but I just wasn't thinking bingo.
>James: ?ABEKLL A11 ALKyL +33 335
#note Nice play. I have no doubt that BLEAKLy would have come raining down in short order had I failed to block.
>Bing: LUW N5 L.W +10 351
#note Just enough to hang on. (WEST followed by LUV L10 works out to the same 2 point win).
