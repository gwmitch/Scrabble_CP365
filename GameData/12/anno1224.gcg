#note For some reason, I blanked on this word.  I've studied it.  I know it.  For some reason, I blanked and thugh she might be confusing it with UNDOCILE, which I recalled right away.  As soon as I stopped the clock, I was pretty sure I f'ed up.
>Jean_Carol: NOQU 4H QUO.N +48 138
>Pete: DLMNPTU L11 DUMP +21 55
#note Best play in an awful situation.  Almost exchanged 7, but figured I had to take some points here.
>Jean_Carol: FTZ I3 F.TZ +20 158
>Pete: EHILNRT 13I HER.IT +30 85
#note HEIL at M12 is slightly better.  I was proud of HERMIT, until my ignorance of its front hook causes problems later.  I know the front hook of its anagram, but blanked on HERMIT's.
>Jean_Carol: ESTW 15L STEW +35 193
>Pete: AEHLNRU 14J HE. +31 116
#note HURTLE N10 is 4.9 better in equity, and much cooler.  I wasn't looking there yet.  I took the easy way out.  It was a craven play, unworthy of an expert.
>Jean_Carol: EWY M7 WYE +30 223
>Pete: ACLNNRU N10 CAN.L. +28 144
#note Best.  The only reasonable play, and not the easiest find.  One of a couple of bright spots in an UGLY game.
>Jean_Carol: AGT H13 TAG +24 247
>Pete: LLNOORU -  +0 144
#note As I mentioned, I did not know THERMIT.  I learned the hard way.  I think frustration got the better of me when I challenged.  I hate getting stomped.
>Jean_Carol: AAEIMNS 12B ANEMIAS +76 323
>Pete: LLNOORU -LLOOU +0 144
#note Duck likes NULL 11D, but I wanted to start over, and I needed the board as open as possible.  
>Jean_Carol: BOR 11D ROB +24 347
>Pete: DINPRRX 10B DRIP +21 165
#note Picked up the X, and Duck likes RADIX B11, because it apparenty smokes crack.  DRIP creates a good line or 2.  
>Jean_Carol: FIR 6F FRI. +24 371
>Pete: NOORUVX N5 OXO +31 196
>Jean_Carol: OSY O7 SOY +24 395
>Pete: EJNNORV O2 OVEN +10 206
#note Screw the Duck, this was my fave play of the game, and in my tourney top 10.  Holding the JER, I'm close to a giant play.
>Jean_Carol: ?AAAAIO -?AA +0 395
>Pete: IJLORUV 5E JO +23 229
#note Of course, I missed it.  I decide to play off the J and go for the miracle bingo.  Duck likes LOUR, but I want more points out of my cool setup.
>Jean_Carol: GIST M2 GIST +28 423
>Pete: AEILRUV 1L VAIR +63 292
#note Best I could do.  GIST was an attempt to block, Jean said.
>Jean_Carol: AE O12 AE +19 442
>Pete: ?EGILUU H8 .UG +5 297
>Jean_Carol: AEEILNT B3 ENTAILE. +61 503
#note Yep, this is my game.
>Pete: ?ABEILU A5 ABLEr +33 330
#note missed BAUbLE for 9 more and more style points.  A fitting end to the slaughter.
