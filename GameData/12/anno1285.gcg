>Paul_Epstein: AEILOSW -AEI +0 0
>Jason: AAOORTU -AOOU +0 0
#note Shades of my AEEORTU opening rack against Weisskopf at BAT. Q rates my play and AUTO as very close.
>Paul_Epstein: GNORSSU 8F SNUG +10 10
#note Paul said he asked G.I. Joel what he would do in this situation. The answer was probably: "Well, you've got two S's, and Jason'll need at least both blanks and three S's to beat you, so just don't throw an S back and you'll be fine." Seriously, Joel said he liked SNUG.
>Jason: ACEGRST -CG +0 0
#note A bunch of options here, none of which score well. My kingdom for an open I...
>Paul_Epstein: OX F8 .OX +26 36
>Jason: AEKRSTV E9 TAV +23 23
#note I (heart) KV draws into RATES.
>Paul_Epstein: EHOR 9H HOER +17 53
>Jason: CEIKLRS L9 SLICKER +86 109
#note LICKERS is slightly better, but I decided to play the one I was 100% sure of, as opposed to the one I was 95% sure of.
>Paul_Epstein: EJRS 14J JE.RS +56 109
>Jason: AEIRSTW 12C WASTRIE +79 188
#note The Hodges drawing class: Pays for itself. OK, I've shaken off the slow start, I'm up a bingo, Paul just played off four, the board's fairly closed, I'm in good shape...
>Paul_Epstein: ?ABCERT K4 CARBu.ET +100 209
#note ...or not.
>Jason: DEEIIMU 4H DEU.E +20 208
#note Q likes I(R)E at M13 best.
>Paul_Epstein: IIM H1 IMI. +21 230
#note Hey, that's what I was gonna do!
>Jason: AIIIMPW H12 .MPI +24 232
#note Another play with a few decent options, no good ones.
>Paul_Epstein: DH 10J H..D +29 259
>Jason: ?AIIIUW -AIIIUW +0 232
#note OK, let's see if I can set the record for exchanges in a won game.
>Paul_Epstein: ADEILNN 5B LINDANE +74 333
#note I held. Forgot the other back hook for IMID. I hate fives. Paul gets four more if he plays it at M1 (and perhaps a challenge).
>Jason: ?AGOORY 13B GOY +29 261
#note A "where was my brain then?" moment: As soon as I punch the rack in, I go: "Why didn't I look for -OLOGY words?" Missed AGRONOMY, AEROLOGY, AREOLOGY (study of areoles?) :)
>Paul_Epstein: ENOZ 14A ZONE +44 377
#note At least it makes my next decision easy.
>Jason: ?ABFOOR 15A AB +51 312
>Paul_Epstein: LQTU C3 QU.LT +30 407
>Jason: ?FLOORV 6K .OOF +15 327
#note Q likes O(A)F at F4. Saw it, can't really say why I didn't play it, other than that I wanted to create an -S hook along the triple.
>Paul_Epstein: AFI 13L .AIF +28 435
>Jason: ?AELORV 2F RE.OVALs +72 399
#note It's only sixth-best, though it's the best bingo. I thought about making a scoring play, knowing I'd probably need to bingo out and catch him with high-point crap, but all the V scoring plays (like Q's choice of VO(M)ER) blocked up the board. Just decided to cut my losses.
>Paul_Epstein: EW 6F WE +28 463
>Jason: AEINNTU 1A AUNTIE +23 422
>Paul_Epstein: DGIOPTY 3L YIP +24 487
#note or YOGI, same spot
