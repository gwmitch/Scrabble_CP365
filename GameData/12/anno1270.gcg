#player2 Glenn_D. Glenn D.
>Matthew: DNOSUYY 8G UNDY +16 16
#note (-1.6) One square to the left is the right position. I was afraid of front hooks... if I had taken a second to think about it, I'd realise there are none.
>Glenn_D.: CLOW H4 CLOW. +13 13
>Matthew: ALNOOSY 4H .OLONY +22 38
#note (-11.6) YOD I6
>Glenn_D.: ABW 3K WAB +37 50
>Matthew: AABEIRS 2L BAA +23 61
#note (-33.6) Horrendous miss. I didn't even think to look for an -ABLE. And I did spend some time on this rack. I blame this play on lack of sleep. Terrible. The 2x2 ABELIAS gets honorable mention.
>Glenn_D.: EIP 5K PIE +41 91
>Matthew: EIIRRSS 6G S.RI +6 67
#note (-7.1) I had look at all the spots for SRI and didn't like the positioning. I didn't even see the BAA-S hook. Sigh. I was blind this game.
>Glenn_D.: HO 1N HO +20 111
>Matthew: EILRRSV 7J VIRL +17 84
#note (-0.8) Quackle likes the fish... (PIE)R
>Glenn_D.: AP 7F PA. +13 124
>Matthew: EMRSTUV M7 .UV +10 94
#note OMG I made the right play.
>Glenn_D.: GIN H4 .....ING +14 138
>Matthew: AEIMRST 10F MI.ARETS +75 169
>Glenn_D.: EGZ K9 G.EZ +28 166
>Matthew: AEEEIMU L12 AE +26 195
#note (-5.7) ME(Z)E... why? Anyone?
>Glenn_D.: UX M13 XU +36 202
>Matthew: EEHIMOU N14 HE +20 215
#note (-7.5) I saw HOMIE. At this point I am extremely paranoid with two blanks unseen. I make no play that opens a line.
>Glenn_D.: AA 11E AA +8 210
>Matthew: EIMORRU 12D MIRE +19 234
#note (-14.6) MOIRE is correct. I make MIRE for the same reason I did HE.
>Glenn_D.: CDEOT 13C COTED +38 248
>Matthew: IJORSTU I3 J. +17 251
>Glenn_D.: EOR 8L E.RO +18 266
>Matthew: FIORSTU O8 .UT +3 254
#note (-7.8) (E)F is best. But there's no way I can leave that line open.
>Glenn_D.: EEEEI -EEEEI +0 266
>Matthew: AFIKORS 15N .F +15 269
>Glenn_D.: EL 11H .LE. +9 275
>Matthew: AIIKORS O1 .SAR +11 280
#note (-13.8) Duck wants me to ex. IIKO... why? So I can draw the blanks and... score 0 with them? OSAR is awful, but I'm not exchanging.
>Glenn_D.: FI I10 ..IF +11 286
>Matthew: EIIKNOT O7 T...EN +7 287
#note (-4.6) ex. EIKNOT is correct. TOUTEN* was foolish. I got confused with STOUTEN and TAUTEN. If I weren't under time pressure, I would have been able to spend a couple seconds to assure myself of this word. Sigh. TOUTENS* was one I always tried on the TENUTOS/STOUTEN rack in Zyzzyva. Who knew it would come back to cost me a tourney game?
>Matthew: EIIKNOT --  -7 280
>Glenn_D.: DET O7 T...ED +9 295
#note Bite me, Glenn.
>Matthew: EIIKNOT N11 NO +7 287
#note (-9.7) OI in the same spot. Serious time pressure at this point.
>Glenn_D.: D 5K ...D +7 302
>Matthew: EIIKOST 14I SKI +25 312
>Glenn_D.: G 14D G +6 308
#note Great play.
>Matthew: EEIOT J13 E.E +12 324
#note Writing is on the wall. Can't block it.
>Glenn_D.: ??NNQT 15A QaTs +39 347
#note Go to hell.
>Matthew: IOT 14B TO. +15 339
>Glenn_D.: NN K14 .N +4 351
>Matthew: I -  +0 339
>Glenn_D.: N 14F N +9 360
#note Okay... what is this for? Just hit pass.
>Glenn_D.: N --  -9 351
>Matthew: I 14F I +9 348
#note I can play this game, too.
>Matthew: I --  -9 339
>Glenn_D.: N 15J ..N +4 355
#note WTF are you doing? Just end this.
>Glenn_D.: N --  -4 351
#note I run up to the computer, type the play in, and walk back to my seat before Glenn gets to the station to press tab. When he returns to the table, he says "So that was 4 points." and starts to record the play. Unfazed, I say "No, that's phony." "Didn't you see it come up valid?" "No, Glenn."
>Matthew: I 4H ......I. +16 355
