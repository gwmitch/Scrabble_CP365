>Rafi: FIKQUWX 8H KIF +20 20
#note Hilarious opening rack, and quite interesting too. Not sure if my KIF is right, but it is certainly interesting, as an underlap under the F opens up FAX or FEW. Maybe I'm being too clever and should just play FIX or QI? While FKUWX is awful, I sometimes underestimate the defensiveness of QI.
>Seth: AEEGILN 9G LINEAGE +75 75
>Rafi: ?OQTUWX J8 ..W +17 37
#note Got excited about QUIXOTE-ish possibilities and missed TOQUE, which sets up a huge X spot. Bad play.
>Seth: AEINRTV L2 AVERTIN. +76 151
#note It's like I'm not allowed to make a semi-minor mistake without getting destroyed for it.
>Rafi: ?FOQTUX 2J QU.fF +72 109
>Seth: NTUY 6J NU.TY +18 169
>Rafi: CMOOTWX 1N OX +32 141
#note My other consideration was WOT under LINEAGE, setting up COX+ for 39, but OX is 9 more and if Seth underlaps LINEATE I have some good tiles for a 30-point re-underlap. 
>Seth: DEEINST 5D DESTINE +68 237
>Rafi: CGMOTTW 10F WOT +23 164
#note Not sure what to do... is it exchanging time yet? Already down to below 7% win chances. (N)OWT uses the same tiles and opens up a lane that should stay open for quite awhile. COW atop DESTINE sims best by a tad... maybe because of the hard-to-block S-hook lane?

>Rafi: ABCMPTV H1 CAMP. +42 226
#note Hilariously, this is my first A or E draw this game.
>Seth: ?AEINRR O8 .RAINiER +77 351
#note Yippee. 4th top 2000 bingo for my opponent! 
>Rafi: BDNPTVY -BDPVY +0 226
#note There should be a Scrabble emergency hotline for games like this. 1-800-ICANTEVENDRAWMYD*CKOUTOFATUBOFLARD
>Seth: AEEEIJO I7 J.. +18 369
>Rafi: ADNORTU 3L .ATU +22 248
#note Oh sweet a bingo materializes on my rack. If I want to win I probably need to play PUD and go for ANORETIC/ROMANTIC/TORNADIC/ANORTHIC. That might win almost .4% of games! A fighting chance for Rafuncho.
>Seth: EY N14 YE +22 391
>Rafi: ADENORT 11E NOTE +24 272
#note This seemed as good as anything, scoring 24 and going for a big underlap bingo. I can't fish for too few on this dying board. And I'm not even really trying to win at this point, but rather attempting to cut spread.

#note I have the case A, so ZA maybe? LOLOLOLOLOLOL
>Seth: BI M12 .IB +18 495
>Rafi: ADDHLPS K11 P.D +12 294
#note Not exactly sure how I can go from an awkward vowel heavy rack to consonant heavy in a flash. HALIDES, HOLARDS, other stuff might happen. :/

>Rafi: ADHLOSV 15A ODAH +54 348
#note I will be V stuck, but Seth is under a minute.
