#note If Jackson plays making AG, I have a good chance at a 70 point Z play.
>Jackson: INPSSUU J6 PU.S +13 13
>Rafi: IIPRTWZ K5 ZIT +30 52
#note Leave is much worse at face value, and I'm scoring 6 fewer, but Jackson is most likely going to play something with ZA, giving me the chance to re-overlap with ZAP. I really like my position if this happens, and am willing to sacrifice 6 points for the chance at a solid lead on a tight board. Quackle respectfully disagrees. One factor I could have added to my analysis (but didn't) is that Jackson would have played SOP or OP if he had an O, meaning that he is more likely to have an A than O, increasing his chances of playing ZA.
>Jackson: AEIINSU L4 EAU +22 35
>Rafi: ?AILPRW M2 WARP +34 86
#note The P leave pans out quite nicely - had I left the T, my options would have been much weaker.
>Jackson: EIILNOS 9C ELISION. +73 108
>Rafi: ?AEILLT E4 ILLAT.vE +78 164
#note Didn't see TAILLIKE, but I still prefer ILLATIVE because I know the S hook and Jackson might not.
>Jackson: CEEEFMR N1 FEME +35 143
>Rafi: AAHOQVY 4D Q. +22 186
#note Keeping the Q with HOY/HAY for 32 might not be bad here - I can draw a T for QAT for 34. AAHOVY is pretty ugly too. My thoughts were that HAY/HOY would sometimes stay open, and that I can draw HEAVY/HOARY/HOAGY for nice scores as well.
>Jackson: CDEEFRS 8A DEF +26 169
>Rafi: AAHOUVY 10A VAU +14 200
#note Took about 4 or 5 minutes on this play. I hate HOYA, as VAU sucks and I'm taking out a potentially valuable ILLATIVE-S hook. Then I was about to play ULVA, but why give up an S hook to the triple when VAU partially blocks lanes and scoers only one fewer? 
>Jackson: BCEERRS D11 REBEC +26 195
>Rafi: AGHOOXY C12 YAH +36 236
#note Drawn in to the CH, and whiffed on COHOG. Bad miss. Jackson also played his last 5 plays in a flash, and I was feeling a little time pressure.
>Jackson: AGHIIRS A10 .IGIAS +36 231
>Rafi: AGNNOOX 15D .ONGO +24 260
#note Jackson asked after the game why I didn't play COGON (one reason is because I didn't think of it) but I still likely would have played CONGO as it is better for hitting 3-tile X plays next turn. Without the X, COGON may be better as it limits the score of bingos.

>Jackson: EIIMRTU 5D I.IUM +18 332
#note Jackson first plopped down MILIEU before changing his mind.
>Rafi: ADEENTT A1 ATTENDE. +83 375
#note Crazy stat I just looked up: 1616 8s begin with D, and 1676 8s begin with A! So basically, the A and D are deadlocked in terms of dangerousness to slot in the top left corner here.
>Jackson: DDEORST 13L TED +20 352
>Rafi: BIKNOTW 13F KNOW +31 406
#note Interesting pre-endgame. Without any E's unseen, my position is actually much easier... I figured out that there were only a few bingos from the pool, so playing NO(TED) or TO(TED) were unnecessary, as I can get outrun too easily by plays like VROOM. I wanted to empty the bag if I could, as after KNOW I can't block TEDS, which means that Jackson has one more shot to hit a fish! So maybe INTOMB is a good option (didn't see it) but the I gives back a few more bingos so I probably can't play that! I'm happy with KNOW - the pool makes it pretty hard to hit a bingo here and I think I can survive a high enough percentage of the time.
