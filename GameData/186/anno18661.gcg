#note This rack became sort of an inside joke for me.  I went back and forth between CHIVY and CHILLY.   Then I started  laughing to myself because I remember Jan Cardia saying the night before that she will "never keep PV on her rack."  Then I started thinking of PAVIDLY*.  Ahahahahehehe... you had to have been there.   Anyways, back to the point. This is a mistake. I definitely should have played CHIVY here.

#note I shouldn't play through this rack because I'm losing.  I'm going to ignore what Quackle thinks.  Exchanging is the way to go.

#note I took an HOUR on this turn looking for plays that will allow me to play to the triple (with the J on the 2LS) next turn and I didn't think there was a play and I was convinced that TIN had to be right.  It's not on Quackle's original list but when added TIN is second to..... 14E LIE!  LIE sets up JANE/LIEN for 61 points.  Sure, JANE can be blocked, but considering how the game actually went I wish I would seen LIE.  I'm still kind of happy with this play because TIN shows that my practicing is paying off and I'm thinking outside the box.  Two years ago, I would have just played K9 AJEE.
>Sid_Murali: IIKO L11 KI +22 483
#note Sid is supposed to be blocking AJEE with H12 OI.  The thing is I actually missed OI when I was trying to figure out a good endgame and thought he'll block AJEE with merely NO or PION.  Sid mistracked and I saw the WTF look on his face when I played TIN.  He was expecting 12I JIVES.  He took a while re-tracking, but still had me mistracked after the retrack.  After about thirty minutes, he plays L11 KI then takes it back but eventually plays it again and hits his clock.  I wish I would have seen THE PLAY.  WTF would have changed to OMG.
