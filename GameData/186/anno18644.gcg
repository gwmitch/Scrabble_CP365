#note Tasha Crashes and Burns at NSC Episode 2:  Da Phoneys.  Oh Puh-leeze.  Insta-challenged.

#note I didn't think of WEEVILS, but I thought of REVIEWS (with first E on the star), but changed my mind because of PREVIEWERS.  Yeah, I'm weird like that.  When some players won't play 8D VIEWERS to avoid the back-extension I play VIEWERS because of it.  I think I may have played REVIEWS had Dave not played the phony.  BINKY* gave some things away.

>Tasha: CFINOOU K4 FOIN +27 109
#note I played this forgetting that I have partial knowledge of his rack.  CUIF is better anyway.  I missed it.  I did, however, see FUCI and I have no idea why I didn't play it.  I might have simply forgot.

>Dave_Leonard: ABDN M2 BAD +31 98
>Tasha: CEEIOOX 9G OX +25 147
#note The only play I considered was VOICE, but I decided to play OX first to take out the H column and THEN play VOICE.  
>Dave_Leonard: ACNT N1 CAT +25 123
>Tasha: CEEILLO D8 .OICE +20 167
#note If I'm going to play here, VOILE is better.  Playing VOICE worked out for me, though.

>Tasha: ADELNPS 13B PAD +24 377
#note Missed H8 EXAMPLED.  I was tempted to go for PREVIEWERS - there's five unseen R's - but I decided to just play it straight.
>Dave_Leonard: AEEHHWY 12I YAHWEH +48 324
>Dave_Leonard: AEEHHWY --  -48 276
#note Actual rack.  Insta-challenged.  Great find, though.  Too bad it's phony and it blocks my bingo in all spots so it's gotta go.

>Dave_Leonard: AEEHHWY B10 WEE.Y +42 318
>Tasha: EGIIINO D2 INI. +8 470
#note I considered MONIE only because I know he's sitting on two H's, but I decided against it.  I thought it best to keep the board the way it is.
>Dave_Leonard: HHNOT H11 .ONTH +33 351
>Tasha: EGIORRS A7 GIRO +20 490
#note Damn, I missed RIGOR.

#note K13 ER sims best, setting up RUERS to go out.

>Tasha: ERRS N8 ERRS +10 506
#note Best.
>Tasha:  (AART) +8 514
#note Considering that he lost two turns AND I drew the bag, Dave did pretty damn good.
