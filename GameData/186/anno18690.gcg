#note Down 91 on a quickly dying board with the perfect tiles for closing it down... hard to figure out what to do. I thought about taking a big risk with CLEOME, but the threat is too easy to block even without an S. Not desperation time yet.

>Rafi: EGLNORV 11E REVOL. +18 56
#note I do not like the looks of RIOT at all. I considered the embedded NOG and well as L(U)V and LOV(E) and GLOV(E), but ultimately decided that I needed to sacrifice equity to make the board more comeback friendly against a player who I know is capable of controlling a board.

#note Paging Mack Meller, pre-Nationials studier of sixes. GUNNEN is a sick play! If you factor in challenge potential, GUNNEN might be better than NUN.

#note Couldn't justify playing DEMENTIA for 2 extra points, opening up a dangerous triple, but maybe with this deficit I need to hope Chris has a scoring play elsewhere and that I hit the triple big? I could never bring myself to play DEMENTIA. The other option is SEAMIEST/IMIDE, which also opens a big triple but leaves open more bingo lanes.

>Rafi: CDENOWY 6D YEW +35 384
#note I can give myself a fighting chance here - the E and T might be hard to block and score, and I have good scoring/bingo flexibility, so if Chris doesn't block and scores elsewhere I can maybe pick up a bingo, and if he blocks I might have a small chance of outrunning. I like leaving 5 in the bag instead of 3 with YOWED or CONEY as it seems too easy for Chris to empty the bag and win.

#note This has to have been Chris's actual rack, as he commented "nice play" after OR, but didn't need to block based on the pool. 
>Rafi: CDEFGNT A7 DEFT +27 415
#note Chris also told me the E was in the bag, so I actually had a shot to win!
