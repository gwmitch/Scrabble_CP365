#note Tasha Crashes and Burns at NSC Episode 6: Da Phony!   I must have been nervous for this game because I  underdrew for the first time ever.  Also, this is my favorite game of the tourney because of the cool 1-in-the-bag situation in the end.  I missed FANDOM, a word I actually played before.  But hold up, if I'm going to miss FANDOM, why don't I just play FOLD? I saw FOLD immediately just now.

#note Rahn already posted his version so I jacked all of his racks. :D

#note The best play with this rack is absolutely BAD ASS! Chococate chip cookie to anyone that finds it.

>Tasha: ADEIRSV K5 VAR +25 70
#note The only play I really considered was K3 DIVA and I thought VAR was better defensively.  I missed VIAND.  I like VIAND better.

#note How embarrasing.  I confused this with ANOOPSIA.  I do this a LOT so there must be something wrong with my brain.   I played IXTER* at this tourney.  IXTER* is my  imaginary marriage between IXTLE and OXTER.  Note: IXTER* stayed on the board.

#note Passed up the bingo for two reasons.  One,  I have a blank and it's only 60 points.  Two, I always misspell it.  After the ANOOPIA* fiasco, I want to make sure I get my next bingo right.  PAYEE is the best non-bingo play.

#note I think this is a pretty cool situation and I took fourty-five minutes on this turn.  Okay, so I have COISITE*.  I should play that, but let me look at the pool first. Wait, I shouldn't bingo because I'll win only if the X is in the bag and my gut tells me the X is sitting pretty on Rahn's rack.  It's a good thing I was thinking along these lines as COISITE*  isn't even valid, but that's besides the point.  Obviously I should fish off an I.  Quackle says playing 11N AI is the best play.  This is because if an L is in the bag, Rahn bingos out with EXHIBIT on column O.   Although AI blocks EXHIBIT, it's also a sure-fire loss.   So I'm going to ignore Quackle.  I will lose if an I or X is in the bag.  (If the X is the bag I'm shoving my rack up somebody's nose.)  I will lose BADLY if the L is in the bag.  Unless Rahn completely blows the endgame,  I will win only if I draw the H.  If I draw a B or T, I'll still bingo out but it won't be quite enough.  So I did a little risk tasking and did a little praying.  (Over-the-board, it didn't occur to me that I could draw the other blank.)    When I was explaining this situation to another player later on, he asked if I was SURE I would lose if I play the bingo (See math isn't my strong point).  I said that over-the-board I was pretty sure that after bingoing I'll win only if Rahn didn't have the X.  Now that I know that COISITE* isn't good, I can say with 100% certainty that I would have lost!
>Rahn_McKeown: ?BIILTX O8 IBeX +48 390
#note When I drew the H, I freaked out  because I suddenly decided that Scrabble has 3 L's instead of 4 and Rahn is about to bingo out with EXHIBIT after all.  But then I came to my senses because I HAVE E-H! and all is well.  After the game, Rahn said he couldn't find a winning play.    In actuality, IBEX IS his only winning play.  But I could always do something Tasha-like.  Like play N2 CHOICES.  
>Tasha: ?CEHIOS A4 HErOICS +104 383
#note WOOHOO!!!  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WORKED!!! I WIN! I'M A FREAKING GENIUS!! :D   Before the recount, I "won" by two.  After the recount, the score was tied.  Final score recorded as 389-389.
