>Joshua_Sokol: ENNOOUY 14F YOU +19 225
#note There really was no reason not to play D11 YOU here over my placement I think. I should also be trying to leave more than one lane open? YOU D11 does that too, kinda. I believed I played this because I was under some impression that I would be able to hit the 15A six line soon and open another lane or something.

#note This wasn't a good thing. It has everything to do with my placement of YOU.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEEEIN C7 EA.E +8 264
#note This was even worse, but this play cannot possibly be correct, even with my slight deficit. I knew I was in trouble once again and so I made a very quick decision to fork the board for a bingoey leave. I do in fact bingo most after EA(V)E compared to any other plays, but so does Jason, who is very likely to have drawn the blank at this point. I have to keep scoring on a relatively closed board, reduce Jason's score and hope to draw some points and at least one blank. EA(V)E does not accomplish this.

#note Jason manages to score and block the lane I just opened. This was a very good play.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEIINQ 4H QI +27 291
#note Unfortunately for him this didn't matter, and this play was going to be lain down anyway. Now that I drew the blank I felt like I should maximize my bingo chances after Jason's play. But maybe I shouldn't leave B10 open for scoring, nor should I leave 12A for scoring. Maybe I should also only leave one lane open (N3/N4) so that bingoing will only happen once. Maybe that's flawed logic though. I think QI(S) is in contention with this. 12A QuIN(S) was also an option but that only puts me 15 in the lead. Jason can easily outrun that with his next plays, and besides, the pool isn't as consonant-heavy as it was last turn, so I'm usually in trouble next turn. But maybe I should have taken the scoring route.

#note Not good, two more vowels. I'm still under the impression that I'm down by 4 more points than I actually am. I missed AEON at A8 for 20, which is obviously the right play on so many levels. It scores, allows me to win without a bingo, keeps only two vowels. I thought I was going to lose this game so I had to try EXTREMAE*. I convinced myself that MINIMAE* was good so this could be too.
