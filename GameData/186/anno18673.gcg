#note Feel free to update with your racks if you see this Matthew
>Will: AELNPUV I6 VALE +23 23
#note I guess VANE is slightly better, LPU > NPU by a full point.

#note I didn't see GORP. Not loving the other plays here.

>Matthew: FHO K6 FOH +24 183
>Will: IIOORTZ N10 ZI. +32 144
#note I don't think I saw G9 TROOZ and played ZIN really fast. TROOZ's major virtues appear to be drawing extra tiles for blanks (worthwhile) and defending against bingos (maybe not so worthwhile).
>Matthew: DEIMT N1 TIMED +34 217
>Will: CEIOORT O5 OTIC +23 167
#note COTE seemed like it would play into Matthew's hands here. Surprised that OTIC sims better anyway.

>Matthew: INR 2I RIN +20 322
#note I think this is actually a phenomenal play by Matthew, presenting a real and annoying-to-block threat if he draws one or both of the blanks, given that the E's and esses are gone.
>Will: ??DGJOT 12A JO.s +38 368
#note Yeah, 11B JAG is pretty clever, but it's scary to shoot for a clever knockout blow in a very close game with a sure and safe win available. That being said I should definitely have played 12A JAGG.
