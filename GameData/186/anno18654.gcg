>Joshua_Sokol: GIKLMPR H6 PRIG +14 14
#note I missed a four here. Guess which one. Dunno why I decided not to play MILK either. This is probably -4
>XP: EY 6F YE. +16 16
>Joshua_Sokol: EKLMOST G5 L.EK +18 32
#note Why not M(E)EK Josh? Hmm, maybe my logic was the the M was gonna score more than 2 points more than the L next turn, but I gotta remember bingos. I'm making this board very bingo-prone and not very score-y.
>XP: AEL 5D LEA. +13 29
>Joshua_Sokol: CIMOOST 10G OSMOTIC +71 103
#note Or maybe I knew I would draw CIMOOST rather than have nothing in CILOOTS. I had never seen this in Scrabble but it made sense. 
>XP: DJNN L8 DJ.NN +30 59
>Joshua_Sokol: DDIOTXY 13K DIDY +32 135
#note Did I miss ODDITY? I guess I did. I also missed 5 other good plays and the I(LEAL) hook.
>XP: EOV 8L .OVE +24 83
>Joshua_Sokol: ELOORTX 11I EXO. +39 174
#note So earlier one might remember me playing EXOSMIA* in this tournament. Turns out that EXOSMIC comes from EXOSMOSE or EXOSMOSIS. So yeah, EX(OSMOTIC) is sick
>XP: AAAAAAA -AAAAAAA +0 83
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNORT 12I LO +17 191
#note Looked a while here, naturally. I'm surprised I didn't miss anything. Don't remember the logic behind this play but I can just add the A. I think I missed that. This seems like it would increase his bingo percentage rather than decrease it. 
>XP: CHZ O6 CH.Z +18 101
#note XP seems to be drawing phenomenally. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AEENRTT 13C ENTREAT +75 266
#note And with my amazing leave I only draw into a 75-pointer. Some bs right there
>XP: ?AAGRRS C7 ARRAnG.S +60 161
>Joshua_Sokol: EEFIRTU 8A TU.F +33 299
#note Don't think I should play FUTI(L)E here
>XP: AEOT 12A TO.AE +20 181
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILNRR 4B LEARN +22 321
#note yeah, destroying his bingo chances :/
>XP: ABH 11E BAH +31 212
>Joshua_Sokol: AEFGIPR 10B F.G +15 336
#note B2 PI(L)AF should be played
>XP: ENU A12 .UNE +12 224
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEIIPR B2 AA.II +14 350
#note What was wrong with (R)AIA again? Oh, it didn't give XP any lanes? Oh, it was that there are a fews I left to draw. Ah, OK, that makes sense. -_-
>XP: NW H13 .WN +18 242
>Joshua_Sokol: DEMPRVW 3A V.MP +35 385
#note I'm not even an equity whore, I'm an equity pimp. I let others whore equity.
>XP: EIQSSTU 15G I.QUESTS +68 310
#note I had to laugh here. I'm so bad at this game!
>Joshua_Sokol: BDEIIRW 12L .IB +15 400
#note Why not WEIRD(O) first, Josh? Oh, you want to block his highest-scoring plays? Ah, that makes sense! -__-
>XP: ?IOOU 2D OUzO +9 319
#note Obviously XP didn't care anymore, or else he would have tracked. He went for style points.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIRW 1G WEIRD +32 432
>Joshua_Sokol:  (I) +2 434
#note I'm not an equity whore. I'm an equity pimp who blows spread, OK?
