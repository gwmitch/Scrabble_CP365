#note I don't like a lot of Quackle's fishy suggestions that overrate ING leaves on this board, and LINEAGE seems like a bad idea, but mine is still a pretty poor choice. BEING or BILGE look better to me in hindsight

#note Second turn in a row I miss the plays on line 13, must have been blind to the spot. FUNDIE is the play here

#note aaaand that's a phony that should have cost me the game. No hold or anything. In this case he didn't have either of the two possible bingos, and if he somehow fishes correctly I just play MUTER on the next turn, but still man, tighten up
