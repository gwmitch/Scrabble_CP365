>Chris: III -III +0 0
>Will: CEEJKUW 8G JEW +26 26
#note JEW must be better than JUKE after ex 3, surely he sometimes has a D.
>Chris: ADEESTY J5 YEASTED +79 79
>Will: ACEIKNU K3 UKE +24 50
#note Considered KUE in the same spot and YUK. YUK does kinda bad things for my ability to open the top left and while I might do KUE in an even game I wanted to set up NUKE/CUKE.

>Will: ?ILPSTW 3C WIP. +18 121
#note Best play is pretty clearly 11E WOS, setting up the T, scoring well, and keeping a nice leave. Darn it. I considered WOST in the same spot but didn't like that it opened no lanes...focus error.

>Will: ABHINRS H11 R.HAB +30 227
#note I gotta admit I was stunned to see BAIRNISH blocked here. REHAB keeps things opener than BAH.
>Chris: AEITX A7 AXITE +38 276
>Will: FIINOST M4 FINO +31 258
#note 13C IF sims great...I don't see it. I'll take FINO every time.
>Chris: AFR 13B FAR +24 300
>Will: GGINSTV 10I V.G +7 265
#note At this score I think I can afford to go for VEG over 6A TEGS/N1 VIGS, and just hope I can bingo before he does.

>Chris: ILNORTV 12K LOV.R +18 383
>Will: ?AEIL M9 LeA.E +26 380
#note After STINGER I apparently didn't depress my clock correctly. Chris notices before I do and alerts me. Maybe three or so minutes have passed on my clock - I have about 2:30 left. After Chris plays LOVER I look at AEILV? for all of my remaining time but can't spot my lone win, sIL(V)AE. Maybe if I hit my button right, I find it with the extra time? I'll never know, but if I didn't find it with 2:30, I tend to doubt it.
