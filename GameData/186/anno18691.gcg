#note Awesome - sweet opening rack. Also to see Cesar's commentary to go: http://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=18567#1#

#note My rack matures from Z? to BBLNRR?. Trading is weaker because not only is this leave not horrendous, but I'm also decreasing Cesar's average score next turn by a few points. NIB might even be better as it scores more and gives back less, but I run the risk of way more terrible racks.

>Rafi: ?BNPRSS 12B P.BS +33 100
#note Played too fast... NUBS is obviously better as it sets up an S hook.
>Cesar: EILMNUY 13A MI.Y +20 104
>Rafi: ?AENQRS -Q +0 100
#note Am I really supposed to play through??? I could never bring myself to play MEN/MAN when I have a 98% chance of bingoing next turn after exch. 1.

>Rafi: ?AENORS G4 ANOR..iES +72 172
#note Happy to set up hotspots after a Cesarian fish. Probably my best find of the tournament!

#note I dislike KU, but this scores best and opens up much needed new lanes. I was choosing between this and KORE, and I don't like how KORE blocks lanes while leaving a leave nearly as undesirable as KU.
>Cesar: ADILNOS K9 LADINOS +76 333
#note Watch Cesar play Scrabble
>Rafi: DFHIKPU L12 FUD +29 275
#note I can't even hit the triple with this rack! I was debating between this and PEH, and I decided to keep a semi-synergic leave + opening a lane instead of 8 more points leaving DFIKU. I guess I should probably play PEH though, as I can hit SKIFF for 60! That's easily my best route rack into this (stupid) game.
>Cesar: DDEERTW F2 DEW.D +34 367
#note To remove the WED from.
>Rafi: HIKOOPY 4J .OOKY +28 303
#note Maybe I can play GOPIK instead... I actually wasn't sure of the non-S-hook but if I was I might have had a small chance of baiting an S-hook or sneaking a GOPIKS* bingo by.
>Cesar: EEFIORT M11 EFT +27 394
#note Cesar is so fit.
>Rafi: EHIPQRT -Q +0 303
#note I seemed like my only shot was to exch. Q and go for GRAPHITE and... PHRAT(R)IE(S)! This would have been such a sick fish if it worked... if GRAPHITE is blocked then I can mayyyybe win with PHRATRIES plus a Q stick as there is only one place to dump QI.

>Rafi: EHIPRTV 10J ..V +6 309
#note HIV(E) hits some 9s through R-S too. I'm hoping for a miracle here... but mostly resigned to going for cutting spread and gaining style points. P(A) will never work.
