>Rafi: AABFORT 8H ABAFT +22 22
#note Thought about FAB or the other ABAFT as well. I'm fine going for an open board this game, but may have played the other ABAFT against a different opponent.
>Max_Panitch: AELNNOP L5 PEN.ANOL +70 70
>Rafi: GIMORTV K2 VIGOR +28 50
>Max_Panitch: AGY 9G GAY +26 96
>Rafi: AEFIIMT M11 FIE +19 69
#note Not thrilled with the board position, but I am setting up a T hook and there's still tons of time to catch up. I'm only down 27 after this play.
>Max_Panitch: ADEEGRS 13F DEGREAS. +73 169
>Rafi: ACIMTTT M3 MITT +20 89
#note Down under 10% already. Yuck!
>Max_Panitch: ?BMOOSS 12A BlOSSOM +83 252
#note Very fortunate he chose this placement, when the underlap is also 83.
>Rafi: ACHIIRT E5 RACHITI. +102 191
>Max_Panitch: KLU A12 .ULK +30 282
>Rafi: DDEENOP N12 EDDO +27 218
#note With DEPONED no longer playable and a huge underdog, I elect to fork the board.
>Max_Panitch: HI 14J HI +28 310
#note Not 100% on LUNULA, but also 6 E's and only 2 A's unseen tipped the scales for me. LUNULA sims best.
>Rafi: AELNPUU 14A .UNULE +22 240
#note Maybe LUNULA instead, which I was only 95% on. 6 E's unseen vs. 2 A's swayed me to LUNULE anyway though.
>Max_Panitch: EILNTU O7 LUTEIN +26 336
>Rafi: ACEIOPQ 8A EPOC. +45 285
>Max_Panitch: EVX F4 VEX +56 392
#note Max thinks for about 4 minutes which made me hopeful, but then this comes down.
>Rafi: AEIQRTW D4 QAT +37 322
#note Thought about the other QAT since I have the second to last I. Maybe I should have done it, as it also leaves open the O.
>Max_Panitch: IZ B6 ZI. +34 426
>Rafi: EIJNRSW 15M J.W +39 361
#note Hoping for a miracle through the V, although I couldn't think of what I could hit at the time. I just knew that IRSW would fall short after JEON - there are zero IRSW+V bingos with the V 7th.
>Max_Panitch: OY H13 .OY +21 447
>Rafi: ?EINRRS 5C R... +4 365
#note IN(T)RORSE almost fits, if AAR was good. Ran out of time and missed fishes for RESTRIVE, but maybe I should just give up here as bingoing won't be enough.
