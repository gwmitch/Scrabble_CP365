#note Played BEECHY quite fast, and thought of the clearly superior BEY after the game. BEY is so much more defensive but I was warped in by wanting turnover and didn't take the time to think of other options.

#note Medium tactical mistake leads to yet another opponent bingo.

#note No U open for OSPD5 SQUEEJEE. I went with JEERS over JEER because 1) 6 more points. 2) 3 esses unseen and no great S hooks means my S is less valuable. 3) one extra chance at the blanks, or a U for QUA for 32 or an I for QI for 37. 4) Robin will almost certainly infer an S and may alter her play slightly to account for that. JEERS sims under 1% below both placements of JEER.

#note Leave seemed too bad to play through here, although Quackle suggests ZOEAE to go for QU(E)EN for 48 or QI for 37. Seems pretty nutty though, but maybe it's right? There are 3 U's and 6 I's unseen though, so I completely see why it makes sense now.

#note I pretty much lost it at this point and took several mopey minutes deciding what to play here. Maybe BIDDY for 30 - doesn't block any lanes and keeps the potent ER while scoring enough to make it harder to afford blocking the board for super cheap.

#note I spent another several mopey minutes trying to decide if I wanted to attempt to cut spread or just play long and lose by 140ish. I put down GOD and then changed my mind and went for GO, needing an E for REINVADE. Only the unseen O and S go after GO, and Robin won't score too much more than with CROP or COPED or something like that. If the V is blocked or if Robin doesn't have the O or S and elects to leave it, I can hit DANDIER, CAIRNED, DENARII, NARDINE, ANEROID, PARDINE, or SANDIER all in that spot. This play will usually lose spread, but sometimes I will bingo out with REINVADE and gain a bunch of spread!

#note NOW NOW. This makes me look so silly. Absolutely horrific end to the most horrific day of my Scrabble Nationals career.
