>Rafi: DLOSTUX I9 LOUT +13 167
#note I spent about 7 or 8 minutes on this play. My first inclination was to play OX for 22, but DLSTU+E plays pretty poorly on this board (21% bingo chances overall). I flat out missed TUXEDO, which looks like a strong play, giving me a nice S hook and turning 5 tiles for the blanks. I discarded EXULT, thinking that OX was better, but EXULT is a fine play here! LOUT sims better than OX but TUXEDO sims about 2% better and EXULT sims better as well. I think my mistake is that there aren't enough scoring spots to feel great about my X spot staying open.

#note My potential mistake costs me greatly.
>Rafi: DILOOSX J9 OX +52 219
#note Played OX pretty quickly. I could play LOID for 36 and hopefully cash the X later! S(KI)DOO for 47 is sick nasty. Maybe I tack on the L here to go for turnover for the blanks? I am confused as to why Quackle prefers LOX when OX bingos more frequently and also leaves LOID for 36 saving the S... is one tile of turnover for the blanks that important? That's another benefit of LOID... if my X spot stay open I've just turned over 4 tiles for the blanks while getting ~90 points in two turns! Interesting position!

>Rafi: EEILOSS 3B OSE +23 278
#note My thinking here is that Nigel will block what he can, and that my most likely line will be on the triple with QINDARS. QINDARS is worth 17, and OSES (if I underlap QINDAR) is only worth 5, so I'm giving up 12. My OSE scores only 7 less, so I'm gaining 5 points if I hit a bingo there. Quackity Quack likes the 30 point OSE.
