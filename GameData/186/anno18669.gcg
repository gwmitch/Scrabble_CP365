>Terry_Kang_Rau: ?EOOPRT H8 TROOPEd +72 72
#note This was OK with me since it was vertical.
>Joshua_Sokol: BGOOQTU G11 GOBO +25 25
#note I always have trouble on my first turn if my opponent bingos and I don't have a comeback. But this seems like the only good play available. Gotta start setting up hooks so that the board doesn't get too closed. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ETY F10 YET +23 95
>Joshua_Sokol: AIINQRU 8D QUIN.A +25 50
#note Should I not be so focused with keeping all quadrants as open as possible here? Maybe I should play QUIR(T) or QUIN(T), or just QUIN(T)AR to give back less? Terry's range seems slightly clunkier than average given her last play and the time it took her to play it. So should I choose to open up later and not bail her out? This doesn't seem like a clear mistake, but maybe I should only be playing QUIN(T)A against stronger opponents (such as those who are very data-driven or are Nigel Richards). This does take so many hooks, and it's still early... Hmm...
>Terry_Kang_Rau: GIZ 7I ZIG +44 139
#note Yeah, bleh...
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEEIRR K5 RE.RADE +36 86
#note I played this a bit too quickly knowing I wasn't going to score better. Perhaps to keep things open I should play J6 A(I)RED or A(I)RIER. I think that looks a tad better. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EFMNORR J9 FORMER +27 166
#note So I blocked (I)NFORMER. That would have stung. Terry made a seemingly good defensive choice here by playing this at J9, although 7 points is borderline too much to sacrifice for a 5% or so bingo decrease, as GOBOS bingos still exist. She said she had forgotten about that lane at some point. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADDILNT 9C DIT +19 105
#note L9 DAD is a preemptive bingo setup that I missed. It seems like a good play, although I think I like my chances better with this, as I already have something to hook it, even though E(DIT) and A(DIT) plays heading downwards are problematic for me. Those are hard to lay down, but Terry can play pretty good defense in my experience. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: BDIIN L11 BINDI +23 189
#note I don't know what her leave was but F14 BI looks like a good play regardless. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ADELNNY 8K .ANDY +30 135
#note It's either this or L(I)NDY. I can't afford to play ADENYL B9 and shut myself down. RANDY scores better and retains a more balanced leave, as well as gives me more bingoing chances next turn. I'll take it.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: KNO 6J K.NO +34 223
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEHLNS 10B HE +16 151
#note I've got to sacrifice the 10 points and play at 10B, or I'll very rarely bingo next turn if Terry makes the right play. I can't assume she'll leave B9 open. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: ELOW 11A LOWE +19 242
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AELNRS 15A RENAiLS +79 230
#note This was a time where drawing the blank wasn't really a good thing. It was going to take forever to go through all of the bingos in this so I decided that this was good enough. It's actually the worst-simming 79-point bingo possible, as it gives Terry the most points back of all the other options. I can do better. I'll concur that this is -2. 
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AHLL 14B HALL +29 271
#note Yup, deserved. 
>Joshua_Sokol: AESSTUU G7 U. +3 233
#note Not the draw I was hoping for. Now I have to go for yet another bingo instead of scoring and keeping the game close. Maybe N1 SAUTES is necessary. Or 15J SU(I)TES. I have noticed that I can usually manage to catch up to Terry and some others in situations of medium deficits like these, so maybe I should focus on that. This actually doesn't bingo nearly as much as I thought, and she's blocking more than not (I should have tried to calculate). This isn't a good play, even against a sub-1800 player. I'm surprised she didn't try and block. N5 USE(D) is also a possibility, since the board will inevitably open most of the time after it, and I still have some time to buy.

#note And I hit it! You didn't think my word knowledge would fail me yet again? Ha! I vaguely remembered CUESTAS once I checked this rack out, and I had decided that if there was no better option, I would always play a French word that I wasn't sure of if I had it on my rack. This one means "tricks". Too bad Terry was not tricked, and she had mentioned she wouldn't be before the game, saying that "I get away with so many phonies" and that "she wouldn't let them by her!"
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AGI 5K .AGI +10 306
#note Well, she didn't see CUESTAS either. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ACESSTU 4L CAT +26 259
#note Of course I wasn't able to find it the second time around either. CAESTUS is also in there but that one I just totally didn't know. This is bad.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: EITW O1 WITE +31 337
#note yup :/
>Joshua_Sokol: EJMPSSU 6D JUMP +26 285
#note I had so many points too! Sim likes ME(TI)S for 39, which does score nicely, and also playing with S(CAN) this turn. I'm not sure I agree with killing the most lucrative lane I could draw in to. Hmm..
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AX N1 AX +41 378
#note too much
>Joshua_Sokol: EEISSSU B10 ..E +6 291
#note I didn't track the C correctly, and if I did, I would have played R(E)D. I also missed (D)ISEUSES? There goes seeing and playing French words... R(E)D wouldn't have won, I looked over the game with Terry afterwards, but it would have cut spread. Maybe she could have made a mistake in the endgame?
>Terry_Kang_Rau: CEINTVV 15K C.VET +30 408
#note Correct! I wonder what percentage of the time we sub-1800 players solve endgames correctly...
