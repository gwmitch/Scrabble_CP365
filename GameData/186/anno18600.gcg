#note SUQ was a major warning sign and I was glad to address the FOODS hook now with a decent play while I could.
>Lawren: AERSX 15K RAXES +55 218
>Will: AAAOSTT 13M SOT +30 251
#note Having just crippled the FOODS hook I felt it was okay to give up the S here, but AAAT is pretty ugly. Sim gives a slight edge to 12K OAT, which also accomplishes the goal of blocking big ?EX plays along row 13.

#note Would've liked to block the Es by playing at 9M, but all my options there give back huge scores. I could keep a vowel with GOBY/BOGY but it seemed worth two points to spend it.

#note YOGA loses to a slew of 7s hooking FANE. It didn't look like there were any bingos available through ADAPTIVE after YO and in fact there are none. With all the hooks to NE left in my possession, I can actually threaten LOGANIA with an IL draw (not that it's unblockable, but still).
