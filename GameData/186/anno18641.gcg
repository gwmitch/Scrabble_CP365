#note Too bad one of the M's wasn't an S.  At least I have a chance to extend it next turn.

#note Even though JOT scored twice as much, I was pretty down on keeping IILNP.  INOP has quite a bit more bingo potential.

>Joey: EINOOPT 11j   LOP             +22  306  OR, PAH
#note The other notable option is OPTION K4!  Not a bad idea, since it gives me four more cracks at the other blank, as well a chance to close off the right side of the board next turn.

#note Even though bingos ending in S were still possible with DIVOTS, I wanted to close off the higher scoring bingo spot.

#note I guess I chose the wrong letter to hang out there.

#note I saw TENPIN on my rack, but forgot to spot the overlap.  That looks better the more I think about it, since it takes a 22 point lead on a pretty closed board, but the unseen tiles are a little dicey.
