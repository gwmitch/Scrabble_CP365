>Joey: EFFLMNO 8H OFF +18 18
>Jesse: ADEENTU G8 DUE +16 16
#note the sim results here catch me by surprise but are interesting. the right play is actually to fish an E (FE at I8), which wins by 3 points over DUE. ADENTU doesn't hit a lot of vowels, which makes it counter-intuitive, but does hit almost every consonant. Similarly, with an opening rack of AADENTU or ADEENTU you should exchange 1. I was not previously aware of the strength of ADENTU. This does not mean that ADENTU is an uber-leave, because I don't think it makes all that many 8s - it's just that a lot of the bingos I can draw will fit nicely at G2 and not get blocked (say NATURED/DOFF).

#note considered BAP as well, but BANCO is a much more potent threat that is likely to fill in well with the huge number of vowels remaining

#note setting up the S lane on row 11 that I had a feeling I would need
>Joey: AEGIMRT 8A AMIG. +30 279
#note I would have had a bongo had I instead played TENORIST 8L last turn.
>Jesse: EGGIOXY 2K .OGGY +24 249
#note I am in a lot of trouble here, but the X seemed to have the best potential to draw a big play, maybe even a bingo if I draw a blank. I can also just play OX at 7B to block the new lanes, but then I remain down at least a tempo, and if he has a blank and bingos the board will be locked down. the sim winner is YOGI at D1 by a tad, but the GX combo seemed likely to go nowhere.
>Joey: AAELPRT 14B PA. +25 304
>Jesse: ?DEINOX 15H NIXE +52 301
#note he is clearly really close (probably doesn't have a blank though). I can play DIOXANES this turn but there are so many lanes available that it has to be right to just play NIXE...
>Joey: AEELRTV C3 RELAT.VE +82 386
>Jesse: ??AADOQ 6B Q.D. +34 335
#note the crusher - a huge mistake here. I am in bad shape no matter what because of my deficit, but burning a blank for QuA at F2 creates a great threat holding the case A! Equally importantly, I take away my vital lane on column A. I had run low on time and could not find this play under pressure. Joey suggested it after the game.
>Joey: EHIIRSZ L7 SIZIER +40 426
#note with joey's actual rack, he has enough ammunition to likely outrun me anyway even after the QUA threat - he can just play HIM/HA and hold the Z to score with. My bingo on row 1 will only be 80 or so. still, QUA would certainly have given me a better chance.
>Jesse: ??AALOW B2 WO +12 347
#note I've looked at this play a lot, and I cannot find an actual winning threat. it seems that joey can always outrun me. I envisioned some endgames where joey wouldn't have the O or the T, but even then he can surely score enough. If I don't create a new lane then Joey will just block further at the bottom-right. There are no desperation bingos through the MO that I can draw. I think for spread the best play might be ALA at F2, which empties the bag but doesn't give away quite as many cheap points. the game was over once I played QADI.
