#note I noticed AO seconds after he drew tiles.  And so I was annoyed for the rest of the game.  He noticed a little bit after I did.

#note Holy sh...I just drew the blank!  Okay, I''m up and wide awake.  He's not that far ahead.  I can catch him.  I GOT THIS!  Play dROOPING.  Nah, it's too soon for that.  Play something small and unnoticable that scores a bit instead.

#note He challenged.  After the game, he said he thought he could have won had he just played 2G LIED instead of challenging.  This is true if you take into consideration my bone-headed 16 point difference with JITTER.   Also, I had him at at 395 after FE so I'm guessing NAY must have been counted twice. Atrocious math aside, he loses regardless.  Whew! Good thing I know how to play an endgame!  :D
