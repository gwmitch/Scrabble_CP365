#note With Jeremy holding an improved rack, I may have overvalued a blank board. VOE is better, but trading has its merits here, I think.

#note This is tough, because no play sticks out. In the end, I took as many points as I could and dug 6 into the bag with both blanks unseen. Quackle suggests 3B ETH, 5I STOUT, and J6 UTS. None of those really intrigue me, to be honest. I guess keeping the U sucks, but I like the defense, too.

#note Nice play.
>Matthew: ?ERRUUZ 6C R.U. +11 260
#note Another tough rack with no really good plays. I missed the top play G6 URD.

#note I missed the other bingo AUREOLED. Quackle actually prefers 15L YAUD instead of bingoing here. I can sort of see why, but there is a lot of non-bingo prone tiles in the bag. That's why I took it when I had it. Wish I'd seen AUREOLED though.

#note Does Q not give any value to leaving one tile in the bag? O4 PIROG sims past my play here.

>Matthew: DGIIOPU C1 P.U +20 402
#note I missed the only out in two. 15A FUGIO, threatening 12J PIED and 2K DIP. PIU sims to win 100%, though.
