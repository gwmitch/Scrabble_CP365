#note A very sticky situation; sim prefers playing short with PA; I disagree.

#note Sim likes taking the points with PST K9.  -RS? is also slightly favoured for exchanges.  Keeping the P would turn out to be costly.

#note I didn't like bingoing in this spot, but there's a big miss of (AD)VISE.

#note Didn't think of SPRiNT --  scores well, and sets up the X next turn.  Everything else looks dreadful, which is why I foolishly exchanged.

#note Sim likes grabbing the points with IR(O)NY.  I was saving this for next turn; though it makes more sense to play the I elsewhere, as my bingo would probably begin with at (FREAK)S.

#note 2F YO is the play here.  I also miss SIGNORY.  Huge blunders.
