>Bill: AMNOPSU H7 MUON +12 12
#note Club game. Plenty of approximately even choices; I personally like this leave best.
>Tom: IIIUU -IIIUU +0 0
>Bill: AIKPRSU I3 KAURI +20 32
#note Quackle slightly prefers KUNA or PUNKA.
>Tom: TW 4H W.T +10 10
>Bill: GILPRRS G9 GIRL +14 46
#note I played this pretty quickly and didn't think about the Y-hook. I thought GIRL or GRIP at J7 closed the board too much, but if I had thought about the Y-hook I would've done something other than this.
>Tom: ACITT K3 ATTIC +21 31
>Bill: OPRRSSS 10E SP..OR +16 62
#note More physics. I thought about this play for quite awhile. He initially put ATTIC down at K2 before moving it, which set up two hotspots for an S instead of 1. That seemed to indicate that he had an S, but since I have three of them I wasn't necessarily going to give him credit for it, so I didn't deem it entirely necessary to take the spot on the L-column, since I didn't like any of those plays. ORS allows too many front-hooks, while SO and SOS give pretty awful leaves.
>Tom: EESX L1 EXES +42 73
>Bill: ACHHRSS 1K R.ACH +30 92
#note This play is way down the list. HARSH, CHARS, SHH on row 11, CHASER, CHARES, ARCHES on row 1, SHAHS on row 8, etc. I saw most of those plays, but I decided on this to take out the triple and save both S's, since the 8K spot will probably still be open next play and with any luck I'll still have a big SH___ play, and hopefully be able to save the last S. Of course, I should point out that I didn't even think about the obvious OUT(REACH) extension, which probably renders this play pretty stupid.
>Tom: GUY 13E GUY +24 97
>Bill: ?AHOSST 8K SHOTS +44 136
#note I wasn't 100% on SHOAT, so I decided to take the sure thing. The only bingos, EARSHOTS and AIRSHOTS at J8, only score 62 and barely make the top 10.
>Tom: I M1 .I +11 108
>Bill: ?AEIJUV 7M JEU +39 175
#note If I had seen E5 JIVEASs for 64 I might've had to play it for the style points, but this is still probably best.
>Tom: ADIQ 11B QADI +32 140
>Bill: ?AABILV 12A VIA +23 198
#note Quackle puts AB/BA/ABA forming JOB at the top, but I think this is clearly best because of the threat of a huge Z play in the same spot (ZINE would score 65). 
>Tom: EFZ 11I FEZ +37 177
>Bill: ?ABLNOT 12J BAN +26 224
#note With the board now essentially closed to 7 and 8-letter bingos, I wanted to keep columns N and O clear for possible nines.
>Tom: EGNOR 13K GONER +27 204
>Bill: ??ELOTT N5 TE..OTaL.d +74 298
#note I saw TEETOTaLs while he was thinking about his play, so I wouldn't say this slight modification qualifies as such an incredible find, but it felt pretty good anyway. Actually, TEETOTaLs wouldn't have even been recommended -- it would've scored the same as TOiLETTEs, which is rated 13th best.

>Tom: INOY 15E YONI +33 265
>Bill: AABILNN E3 LABIA +17 385
#note Costly brain cramp here. Not playing LABIA one spot lower is the obvious mistake, but plenty of plays, most of which I know, block DEFAMER and allow me to go out the next turn (well, so does this one, except I didn't know NAAN).
