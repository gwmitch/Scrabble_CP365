#note 11A OBL(I)GOR 20
>Dave_Leifer: BEW C9 WEB +27 101
>Ryan_Fischer: ACOOQRX J4 COXA. +30 124
#note E5 COX(A) 44.  I passed up variations of that rack down low for defensive reasons.  Weak.
>Dave_Leifer: GRU K5 RUG +24 125
>Ryan_Fischer: ADDOQRV H5 QAD. +14 138
#note B8 DADO 29 is... interesting.  I probably should've dangled an S hook out there, though I don't know what it'd accomplish.
>Dave_Leifer: AOTU E3 AUTO +14 139
>Ryan_Fischer: DEJORVW 10B V..D +16 154
#note Forgot DOWER (B10).  Weak.

>Ryan_Fischer: EIORTWZ F8 .ITZ +26 236
#note Was really praying for an H.  F2 ZIT 36 completely slipped by me as did a bunch of other viable plays.
>Dave_Leifer: AENP D1 PEAN +28 225
>Ryan_Fischer: EEORRUW 1D .OWER +30 266
#note I didn't play RE(P)OWER 'cause I wanted to draw at AIR- or SEA-.
>Dave_Leifer: ADTY 13B TA.DY +16 241
#note Q says G6 YA(l)D 24
>Ryan_Fischer: EEIIIRU -EIIU +0 266
#note Keeping the I for AIR(POWER) still, but I'd probably keep IER anyway.
>Dave_Leifer: AMT G6 MA.T +18 259
>Ryan_Fischer: EFINRRS 3K F.E +23 289
#note 7F F(AD) 24.  I probably shouldn't have used my E here, but didn't see a way to score without giving something back.  Didn't want to do FIR just yet.
>Dave_Leifer: KY 2B KY. +20 279
>Ryan_Fischer: HINNRRS 14A HIN +18 307
#note Let's pause for a moment to relish how much I dislike games like these.  They're races to the better draw, essentially, now.  And it's now that I decided to take the points.  I think I'd've been safer putting the F down there, though.  Q says RIN is much better than HIN.  Yeah, I guess.
>Dave_Leifer: IN 15A IN +24 303
>Ryan_Fischer: ALNRRSS H5 ....S +18 325
#note I'm really in a bind here, so I just take points and fish for an E.
>Dave_Leifer: EIN 11F .EIN +13 316
>Ryan_Fischer: AGLNRRS G1 .RG +6 331
#note Ruh-oh.  Q says SNARL which is dumb (well, except for opening a separate line), and then (E)RR.  I played (E)RG there instead.  Actually, SNARL might not be so bad at all, well, except for the fact that he's been building his rack. I don't know what to think now.  This game was obviously really frustrating.
>Dave_Leifer: EILOSTU L7 OUTLIES +70 386
>Ryan_Fischer: AALNRRS J11 SNARL +21 352
#note Wow, Q does it again, coming up with a face-saving play of 12I ARL(E)S 7, which blocks a lotta stuff.
>Dave_Leifer: DEIV H11 .VIED +39 425
#note And of course I was so worried about plays through the L I'd give him that I totally overlooked (I)VIED.
>Dave_Leifer:  (AR) +4 429
