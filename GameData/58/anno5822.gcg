>Ryan_Fischer: BDEEETV 8E DEBT +14 14
#note Not surprising that DEBT doesn't rank.  I guess I should've gotten rid of the V, but I didn't like the prospect of leaving a B much more, and wanted to play another tile.
>David_Gibson: ?ADHPRT F5 THR.APeD +77 77
>Ryan_Fischer: EEOORUV 12B OVER.UE +24 38
#note Mental note: VODOU is good.  This is better, slightly.
>David_Gibson: FOOW 11H WOOF +25 102
>Ryan_Fischer: BEGIKNO 10J BOINK +42 80
>David_Gibson: ACY C10 CA.Y +24 126
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEGINY 6F .YGIENEs +66 146
#note Missed rE(K)EYING and ENGI(N)ErY.  The former is kinda dumb.  I'd've definitely played the latter if I knew it.  Just happy to see this one.
>David_Gibson: AAW 5I AWA +23 149
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIRRS O5 RERAISE +83 229
#note Rack management FTW.  (I'll never get tired of saying it, or experiencing it.)
>David_Gibson: EHM 13G HEM +30 179
>Ryan_Fischer: ALLOTUX 14H LUX +37 266
#note A bit risky (because of the bingo lane -- WEEL doesn't take an S), but the points are worth it, one or two turns away from a locked board.
>David_Gibson: ANT 7H ANT +18 197
>Ryan_Fischer: AAILLOT 15I TILL +19 285
#note 13G (HEM)ATAL is pretty nice, but it doesn't close off one of the last dangerous lanes TILL does.  Not a very high valuation at all because of the horrible leave, but I figure there are two ways to beat Gibson: blow it wide open, or get out to a slight lead and beat him at his own game.  Done the former, now trying the latter.
>David_Gibson: DE -  +0 197
#note Lost challenge.  He blanked on MUT here, confusing it with MIT*/MITT.
>Ryan_Fischer: AAEEIMO M9 A.OMIE +18 303
#note Very interesting how even one consonant saved me there.
>David_Gibson: DE 12M .ED +19 216
>Ryan_Fischer: AEORRUV 4K VERA +20 323
#note This is again way down.  I was hanging onto that U with the Q unseen.  Q likes VAU here.
>David_Gibson: GN 11B G.N +9 225
>Ryan_Fischer: DIOORSU N14 DO +12 335
#note Absolutely no reason to open anything, so it begins.  10C (C)OU(P) is nice.
>David_Gibson: IT 12K TI... +22 247
>Ryan_Fischer: AIORSTU 9I OAT +16 351
#note (C)OU(P) suggested again.  I just liked taking the points.
>David_Gibson: N 15N .N +6 253
#note I'm ... not gonna open it!
>Ryan_Fischer: IILRSSU 7L SI +7 358
#note Oh, Q, how silly you are.
>David_Gibson: C I4 C... +6 259

>Ryan_Fischer: ILPRSSU O1 PIS +28 394
#note Overlooked SIP (RIP/LIP).  Whoops.
>David_Gibson: EFGJNOZ L1 JEF. +22 305
#note I think he started to play ZON(E), then saw he could set up his Z.  I don't know which way is better.  Mighta saw something I didn't.  I don't know if there was a way to stick him with one of those power tiles.
>Ryan_Fischer: LRSU 2I LUR. +6 400
#note Blocking ZON(E).
