#note Wasn't sure how to play this rack after an exchange one. Debated something short like EX. Maybe HEX, only three behind this according to Speedy?

#note Ugh. I just didn't know what to do here. Maybe take the two extra points with LEAN (or the sim-approved LEAL) at 15G; the S-hook I'm creating ain't that big a deal. ELAIN didn't thrill me.

>Jason: ABCELNO 15N AB +23 263
#note Hated playing short with both blanks out, but with the unseen pool at 18 vowels and 16 consonants, keeping a 3-2 balance and taking out a hot spot wasn't bad.

#note I should've tried UND(E)CkED (I didn't know/see b(E)DUNCED). I looked at how the endgame would play out after DUNGS. I saw Kevin could win with TERAI at H1, but thought he might not know it. I really didn't like UNDECKED (I'd have put myself at about 20%), and felt like after DUNGS, I had a greater than 40% chance of tying. So I went with it.
>Kevin_McCarthy: AEIOORT 5H A.OOT +16 398
#note But I forgot something. Kevin can block my outs through the E and I by playing TOO or AIT at H4. Fortunately he didn't see it, didn't know TERAI, and took one of the many ties available.
>Jason: CDE 3F CED. +8 392
#note Incredibly fun game. The tie ended up as good as a win, as everybody else would lose at least twice while I was unbeaten through six and was Gibsonized.
>Jason:  (EIR) +6 398
