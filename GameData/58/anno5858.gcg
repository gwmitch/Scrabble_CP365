>Bing: CHIIOSY 1M HIC +32 162
#note This was a miss - ITCHY is clearly the play. But I was rewarded with a hugely lucky pickup.

#note This seemed okay, to take the points, but it worked out horribly. SWAIL would have left me with some ammunition.
>Matthew: ?AENRST 14H STERNAl +76 243
>Bing: AALMOUU 15M MOA +20 291
#note Feeling it slip away. May have been time to dump here, but I thought MOA was barely worthwhile.

#note Great play by Matt, setting up his blank and clearly signalling that I was toast.
>Bing: ADEIINQ D8 N..I +5 316
#note Not looking good at all. Obviously I had to get rid of the Q, but also score a few points. Possibly RIN 7L would be slightly more difficult to defend.
