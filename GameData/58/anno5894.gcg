>Jim_Burlant: ABJORTV 7F JOB +23 23
#note Urp,  too fixated on rack cleansing.  F6 JOT wins.   Poor play.  
>Florence_Spanfelner: ISX J6 XIS +34 48
>Jim_Burlant: ?AAGRTV 5D GRAViTA +81 104
#note Didn't see VAGRAnT (the only bingo in this rack) and it took several minutes to come up with this.   I confused this with the legitimate GRAVIDA and forgot that GRAVITA* is phony without a back S.  She held this for a while...and when you see her next rack you'll realize why she let it stick.  Among legit plays, 5F VAGRAnT wins the sim.
>Florence_Spanfelner: AQT 4H QAT +56 104
>Jim_Burlant: ADELMTV 5D .......TED +28 132
#note Not thrilled with the leave, but what's life without some style?   D3 MAGLEV (which I didn't know) wins the sim.
>Florence_Spanfelner: DRU D2 DRU. +12 116
>Jim_Burlant: AGLMOUV L1 VOGU. +26 158
#note 9E VULGO wins with this choice a distant second, as almost a 7-point dog.
>Florence_Spanfelner: DIO 1L .OID +24 140
>Jim_Burlant: AIILMOY 3B AI.ILY +26 184
#note Considered 2B MADLY but liked this better, as I didn't like the idea of keeping duplicated I's.  Quackle agrees, this choice wins the sim hands-down.  I've been holding steady at 64 - 65% 
>Florence_Spanfelner: AF 2B FA. +26 166
>Jim_Burlant: EHMNORW 2J WH.M +24 208
#note 2K MOWN wins, with this choice a 5-1/2 point dog.  Still treading water here, not losing or gaining winning prospects.
>Florence_Spanfelner: EOPT 9E POET +19 185
>Jim_Burlant: EENORRT O1 .OER +6 214
#note Couldn't see what else to do so I figured I should balance the rack and take out the  most dangerous line.  While the sim doesn't like this play (1K OVOID and E9 PRONE are the winners) this play was huge for me, as you'll see in a moment.
>Florence_Spanfelner: AEEILNS M5 .ELAINES +61 246
#note Only playable bingo for Florence, and she's now at 58% winning chances.  But this helped me out quite nicely.
>Jim_Burlant: EEIINRT 12F NITERIE. +68 282
#note Again, the only playable bingo, no other 8's available.  Now I'm back at 61% winning chances.
>Florence_Spanfelner: CLL 8L C.LL +27 273
>Jim_Burlant: ?AKMOSS 1H OKA +26 308
#note Not doing myself any favors with my board vision here.  11H AMOK is the clear winner, but I didn't see it; I was too paranoid about something like ZOEA 1G so I figured I should take that spot out.  Even blundering away equity, I'm now at 94% winning chances.  Guess that's what happens when you hog the power tiles for yourself. 
>Florence_Spanfelner: ACNNO 13C CANON +21 294
>Jim_Burlant: ?BHMSSZ D12 M.SH +26 334
#note What do you do here if you don't know WHOMSO (eliminating sim winner N1 ISM and bronze medalist N1 IS from consideration?)   I saw K11 BIZ (the runner up) and didn't want to give her an easy chance to hook it with something like YEARN for 47.  Normally I'd play off the B and keep the M, but I was looking for an E for BIZE whch I would then hook with my S on row 15 after that.    Very reluctantly made this play, hoping I wasn't giving her the game-deciding opening, but I didn't see any good options.
>Florence_Spanfelner: EEINT 15C T.EINE +27 321
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEOPSZ J10 ZE.O +33 367
#note I'd rather set up my S and take the points; Quackle prefers K11 ZIP to this; I'd rather take the bag down to 1.  With the blank I figure I have a decent chance despite the leave.
>Florence_Spanfelner: AFY 10D FAY +34 355
>Jim_Burlant: ?BEPRRS 11L R.B +7 374
#note I thought I was being slick by setting myself up for an unblockable out play.  14J SuPERB (which I didn't see) and 8A BuRPS win 100%.  This play loses against Quackle but wins against most humans.
>Florence_Spanfelner: DENUU 13I D.NE +17 372
#note Ok,be honest - how many of you see her winning out play?  If I had seen it I would have played SuPERB on the previous turn.  Obviously she didn't, either. 
>Jim_Burlant: ?EPRS O11 SPoRE +33 407
