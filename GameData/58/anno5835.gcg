#note sims 2nd to 7h NIDIFY after 1000 on 4pl.
>jeremy: IIMR H10 MIRI +14 26
#note jeremy saw the d8 hook, but told me afterwards he was setting up his X. 
>james: EFINQRY G13 QI +42 57
#note i have to
>jeremy: CDEEOSX 15A CODEXES +116 142
#note INDEXES & INDICES, CAUDEX & CAUDICIES, VORTEXES & VORTICIES, VERTEXES & VERTICIES........ but not this one !!!!!!!!
>james: EFHNRUY 14F F.NERY +42 99
#note partly didnt challenge CODEXES because i thought it was good, and partly because of this play.  If i challenge CODEXES and it's good, it's pretty much game over.
>jeremy: EIOU F6 OU.IE +9 151
>james: ADHIITU 15K AUDIT +26 125
>jeremy: BOP 14B BOP +29 180
>james: AAEHIOT 13C HAO +31 156
#note 13b AHA is a few more points.
>jeremy: AEERZ 13K RAZEE +34 214
>james: AEGILOT H1 LATIGO +29 185
#note so far all my plays make sense (i think)
>jeremy: ?ENORST O6 SEROTiN. +74 288
#note SEROTINy now (i was saying to myself in a frank costanza fashion).  O7 ROtTEN(E)S(T) is the fancy pants play.
>james: EJNSTUV D12 J... +26 211
#note the sim loves 6b JUNT(O) or A12 JUST/JEST which i just/jest clear whiffed on. I'd have played that definitely - clear error.
>jeremy: AAIV 1D AVAI. +9 297
>james: ENNSTUV 10B VENU. +16 227
#note best - i saw AA? unseen and just crossed my fingers that a) i got the tiles, and b) before jeremy did and noticed the front hook.
>jeremy: ABRW E3 BRAW +23 320
#note turns out he missed the hook.
>james: CEGLNST J8 SECT +38 265
#note i guess going for the points here is right. 4 tiles turned over - i want that A?  Q likes J4 GLENS leaving CT - im not sure why.
>jeremy: KLU 4C LU.K +16 336
>james: GLLMNOS 2H .LONG +8 273
#note this is a horrible play. i should be castigating myself over this. 6k MOLL(S) or LONG(S) apparently gives me a shot as high as 17% (if that's to be believed).
>jeremy: ?EEFHIT N1 HEFTIEr +83 419
>james: DELMNST C2 ME.DS +16 289
#note O1 EM, cough cough.  i guess i wasnt looking to save spread.
