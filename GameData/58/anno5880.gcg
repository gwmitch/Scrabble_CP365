#note I saw that this would probably be his best move, considering his rack.

>Toh_Weibin: ?ADFNOR 13B FORD +30 113
#note Was considering FORDANt* for a long while before backing out of it. It's FONDANT. FRA apparently sims better on CP, but I don't really think it's better...

#note The moves CALVES or CAVELS N6 seem to have merit, raising the possibility of picking the blank.

#note Not good for me! But I am very lucky he did not play F3 STONE(C)R(OP)S for 77 instead...
>Toh_Weibin: CEEGLOY 4E GOEY +25 305
#note Missed the beautiful C(OMIT)Y 10E for a dazzling 45 points!
>Tony_Sim: EFGIO 6B FOGIE +24 293
>Toh_Weibin: CEEILPR C3 PEL.RIC +30 335
#note FOGIE is a worrying move to me. The 5 tile turnover means that he might pick up the blank. I have to play this to hope to pick up the blank or some high scoring tiles. A plus point is that a high scoring move from 8D is unlikely, unless the blank is used.

#note Quackle prefers the more agressive KIS M3. EKE is played as a fish and also to block the X spot.
