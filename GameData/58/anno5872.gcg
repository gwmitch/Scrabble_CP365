>Cesar: DEEFNOY E4 FOYE. +22 22
#note definitely fozy. annoying that i didn't think of it, but foyer worked out anyway. -2.5
>Maddy: EKX F3 KEX +28 66
>Cesar: DDDEEFN H2 DEFEND.D +68 90
>Maddy: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 66
>Cesar: AJLLNRT -JLLT +0 90
#note didn't seem right to play here but i didn't see KNELL or KNELT. still doesn't seem fully right. keeping RANT is better but i get scared of too many consonants. -3
>Maddy: AO G7 A.O +22 88

>Cesar: AEELOPT 14B PE.AL +33 205
#note lol. i was right with my first instinct of C12 OPEN, which i laid down, but then i just didn't like the score. funnily maddy had BRUTISH ready to go down until i took my play back. it's a close call anyhow. -0.7
>Maddy: BHIRSTU 13C H.T +26 236
>Cesar: EENNOTU 4H .OUNT +16 221
#note damn focus mistakes. i saw the AZON hook but i don't think i found anything right away, and FOUNT just seemed ok to me. must focus! -7.5 TUREEN
>Maddy: BORU 10B BU.RO +15 251
>Cesar: EEEINOS 11D .EE +12 233
#note I7 OSE is tempting for the points but REE is better. it's so close.

#note sure would have been nice to have jiao at N6
>Maddy: ARW L12 WA.R +28 375
>Cesar: AABGIMO J6 MAGI +23 372
#note i'm amazed that my play sims highest, it didn't even show up on the generate choices list. it actually doesn't make much sense to me. i wish i'd thought of GAMBIA at N3, which is very nice.

#note quackles says C9 BUD is best but that doesn't make sense to me. i chickened out on DOBLA. TOD L4 is interesting cuz of something like votable i guess. it just seems extremely difficult to win this game. any ideas? -14% if i do draw the S i probably have a shot with BUD, though.
