#note Had Q(U)BYTE set up to go, but he made my job easier.  BOY C11 was tempting too.

#note I was wondering where those esses were.  He said he would've liked to play something like TASS O1 if he had an A, shut things down.  Not an ideal situation for either of us.

#note And he couldn't have given me an I, either.
>Chris_Cree: ?CDELLO 13G COLLEt.D +64 405
#note He saw both this and LODiC(U)LE.  This game seems lost, doesn't it?  I held for a while, trying to figure out if I could come back.  So now, kids, watch me pull this rabbit outta my hat!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGNOTX 14A OX. +43 356
#note AX(O)NE will lose.  It blocks too many lanes and empties the bag.  Even Quackle's static evaluator knows that.  So, I take OX(O) and roll the dice on a 1/6 chance of pulling IR or something else that will bingo.  Don't know if there is anything else.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEGINRT 1A .ERATING +86 442
#note Ole!  Later he figures out that (B)I 1A will block the killer and absorb TEARING, leaving him with ALC(O)VE after my bingo.
