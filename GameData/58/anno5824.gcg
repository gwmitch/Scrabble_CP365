#note Yeah, this isn't gonna be a good game.  Very nice play, though.  Too bad I'm not up on my pastas.

#note J4 DEFY(i)NG 26?  I'm not so sure.

>Ryan_Fischer: AGNOORT -  +0 34
#note Dammit, he blocked ROGAT(I)ON.  And I don't remember this.  And I'm really close to TRAGO(P)AN -- not that that should weigh in at all in my decision otherwise, and not that I'd see it when it's actually playable.  :)
>Evans_Clinchy: LY 1F .LY +24 206
>Ryan_Fischer: AGNOORT 4C GAR.ON +20 54
#note I have no idea what to do here.  Apparently Q really likes a leave of AGNRT.  I8 (L)OO 15.  GAR(C)ON, I guess, is bad because while it scores, it doesn't score nearly enough to justify killing those lanes.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEW 3F .WEE +23 229
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIORTT D1 IOT. +5 59
#note And I blocked TROI(L)ITE.  Q suggests the kamikaze (BO)OTIE (quite an interesting baby shower gift, if I might say so).

>Ryan_Fischer: GIKNNRW 1A KIW. +33 240
#note I was perfectly happy with KIW(I), but I guess some other plays are viable.  2J W(R)ING, B6 WINK.  Hmm...

>Ryan_Fischer: GINNORT 6B N. +4 244
#note Really had to talk myself out of trying something stupid like (I)NTROING*.  Whoda thunk there's something there?  Well, besides someone who knows more words than me.  I'll teach myself the same way I learned NITROGEN.  It's NOT RENOTING* or RETONING*!  (I)GNITRON O1 80 FTW.  At least this sets up a spot for me (unless he has the blank).

#note Unfortunate last rack for him.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?DLN N1 .NDoL +10 334
#note I try to see the silver linings.  Happy I can find this out at least.  :)  Very well played by him.  ...not so much by me.
