>Matthew_Larocque: ?AENNRR 7H RAN +12 12
#note I actually thought of ensnarer, but didn't think it was acceptable. :/
>Allan_Simon: FTTU K4 TUFT +18 44
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEINQR 4H QIN.AR +50 62
#note I suck at finding Q bingos, mainly because I don't really know many. But taking 50 points while keeping e? is pretty good I'd say. Better than the 66 point bingos.
>Allan_Simon: BIO 9E BIO +16 60
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADEEIS N2 DISEAsE +84 146
#note Didn't think of seaside. I did consider ideates under bio, but wanted to yank the qintar spot while I could, and play under bio later.
>Allan_Simon: ILMP O6 LIMP +39 99
>Matthew_Larocque: CEINNOT 5E CONI +23 169
#note A few words here I didn't know. Might have been better to play under bio, but I still like coni.
>Allan_Simon: EOZ F4 O.ZE +33 132
>Matthew_Larocque: DENORTU 10D RODE +30 199
#note I felt silly here. First I considered node, but was wary of anode. So, I played rode totally forgetting about erode. Just ode might be better to avoid opening a bingo lane for a measly 1 point. Detour looks really good but I never caught that during the game.
>Allan_Simon: KO E9 ..OK +20 152
#note I'm not sure if he was intentionally setting up a huge hotspot here.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFNTUU 12B FUN. +22 221
#note First I thought about feu/erode, but I wasn't sure if he knew ebook, so I wanted to leave that play open.
>Allan_Simon: ?DEEHLS L7 SHELvED +83 235
#note Luckily he didn't find that nifty 8 letter bingo. I probably wouldn't have either.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABDELTU 3C DAUB +30 251
>Allan_Simon: AX M8 AX +43 278
>Matthew_Larocque: ACEELNT 2G LANCETE. +67 318
#note Almost went for lance/ebook, but then I remembered seeing lancet as a verb in the dictionary.
>Allan_Simon: ATUV 1F VATU +31 309
>Matthew_Larocque: AEGILMR 8A GRIME +44 362
#note Still cashed in here, so I was really happy.
>Allan_Simon: IPY F12 YIP +29 338
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILOTY 10J AL.EY +28 390
#note Wasn't really looking to fish here, maybe I should have? I just felt that fishing doesn't always produce good results, especially at the end when my time is getting low and there are only a few places to play bingos. my bingo knowledge isn't superb either. I was leading, so I was simply trying to maintain good scoring. Blanked out on yipe though, which would have been a better idea.
>Allan_Simon: EHORSVW 15A HOVERS +48 386
#note What a bingo that would have been!
>Matthew_Larocque: GIINOST 11G SING +19 409
#note Could have played this end a little better. Mainly, I wanted to go out in 2 moves. Didn't know rode had an s-hook, or the word stingo.
>Allan_Simon: AGORTW 4A GROW +33 419
>Matthew_Larocque: IOT 13L .OIT +10 419
#note This was so close... I nearly played tori for 6, which would have produced a tie game. I literally saw doit at the last second, which gave me the slimmest of victories.
