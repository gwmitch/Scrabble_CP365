>Joey_Krafchick: FIILM H4 FILMI +28 28
>Ryan_Fischer: CEERSST 9F SECRETS +74 74
#note Didn't know CRESSET or RESECTS, but I doubt it mattered too much.
>Joey_Krafchick: ADIKOP 8L APOD +27 55
#note He showed PIKA G3 first.  Q suggests L4 OKAPI(S).
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDGLTW J5 CLAW.D +18 92
#note Missed W(I)LDCAT.

>Joey_Krafchick: AJTU C9 JU.AT +40 176
>Ryan_Fischer: ?INOORR D6 INRO +14 172
#note 7E NOR(M) is interesting; sets up E(NORM).  I wanted to score more than what O(A)R in two places would afford me, with less risk.  Hence, INRO.
>Joey_Krafchick: BEENNOT 12A BE.NO +28 204
#note He told me his rack and I saw he missed BONNETE(D).
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AALORV A8 LAVA.O +33 205
#note I should've seen VARiOLA C1.  Just couldn't quite put it together.
>Joey_Krafchick: DENOTTU E3 DUNT +12 216
#note Told me he wasn't sure of UNDOTTE(D) either.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?NNRRSU 11K .RN +3 208
#note 7L RUN still leaves the possibility of -ED bingos and scores.  I was about to dump the RN at B12 until I remembered ERN takes an E, too.  It's really not too smart to fish with such a middling leave like that.  I guess with the blank and the S I was feeling a bit too confident.
>Joey_Krafchick: ELS O12 .SLE +31 247
#note (I)SLE was a very nice play; guess he wasn't aware that LAVABO can be pluralized with -ES.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EENRSU O1 UNREStE. +77 285
>Joey_Krafchick: EHNT 5G ..T.HEN +32 279
#note Nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADFRYY L1 FRAY.D +34 319
>Joey_Krafchick: MO L11 .O.M +16 295
#note Guess he was hoping the blank was in the bag.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IIPVWY 1H VIvI.Y +42 361
>Joey_Krafchick: AAEEGIU M3 GA.E +24 319
#note Another good play, blocking my best out.
