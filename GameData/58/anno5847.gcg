#note This exchange favors my word knowledge better, and I didn't think that GRIND for 14 or 18 pts was worth the trouble.   Sim winner is exchange DT, keeping GINRT.
>Cheryl_Melvin: AEJN H7 JANE +22 22
>Jim_Burlant: DINRRTY 10D TIND.RY +21 21
#note Best.  
>Cheryl_Melvin: ADHI 7E HAD.I +19 41
>Jim_Burlant: ABDEORX 8A ABODE +35 56
#note Didn't know TEABOX, and didn't see ADOBE until right after I had hit my clock.  While ADOBE is definitely the better play here, this minor equity slip winds up costing me.
>Cheryl_Melvin: ?AGILST B8 .LASTInG +74 115
#note Ouch.  Given how quickly she slaped this down, I have to wonder if she would have found the J1 bingos had I put down the better ADOBE on the previous turn.
>Jim_Burlant: IORSTUX 6I OX +27 83
#note When I put this play down, I didn't like it for two reasons:  that I didn't shed the U, and that easy placement for her to either front-hook the X or back-hook OX with an O.  But given my deficit, I felt that anything else gave up too many points.  Quackle prefers D10 TUX 20. 
>Cheryl_Melvin: DOP 5I POD +26 141
>Jim_Burlant: IIRRSTU -IRU +0 83
#note Best.  I'm now at 21% winning chances.
>Cheryl_Melvin: GIV 4J VIG +30 171
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMRST M3 MAESTRI +80 163
#note All 3-tile draws to IRST should go this well.  But too bad the G in row 15 was in the B column instead of the C column.  Anyway - the sim says it's a tossup between this choice and IMARETS M2.   Though I only trail by 8, I'm only at 33% winning chances.
>Cheryl_Melvin: AF 6F FA +29 200
>Jim_Burlant: EEFNOTW 8L F.OW +42 205
#note Best.
>Cheryl_Melvin: IU D10 .UI +6 206
>Jim_Burlant: AAEEENT 15A A.EE +18 223
#note 15A AGENE wins the sim by less than a point over this play, which sims second.  I'm now at 55% winning chances...but they're about to take a serious dive.
>Cheryl_Melvin: ?CEORST 14D ROCkETS +68 274
>Jim_Burlant: AEIMNQT N2 QI +26 249
#note I considered fishing off the Q for 11, as this is a great rack except for the Q.  But with this board I didn't see AEIMNT leading to any playable bingos if I played QI 13A, especially since I expected her next play to be something at H12 or H13.  Thus, this reluctant choice to play for points.   I now have to hope I can win the luckbox race to one of the two remaining I's in the bag.   In my last 5 turns I have lost barely a fraction of a single equity point...and I've fallen to 22% winning chances. 
>Cheryl_Melvin: WY H13 Y.W +27 301
>Jim_Burlant: AEMNNTU 13A N.M +10 259
#note I knew this was weak but couldn't see much of anything.  I felt that I needed to risk leaving O1 open, which ruled out MUN or MENU O3.  I really should have fished off the U here, and Quackle is, I believe correct.  C12 UN wins the sim at 13% winning chances though the highest valuation plays are H1 MENTA for 31 and L8 FANUM (both of which I didn't know).    This play sims around 7%.
>Cheryl_Melvin: NN E10 .NN +12 313
>Jim_Burlant: AELNTTU L8 .LAUNT +20 279
#note Didn't know LUTEA, which is the best play both for score and the fact that it would have opened up the northwest quadrant. LUTEA comes in at 14% winning chances, with this choice coming in at 10.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EHOR O8 .HORE +12 325
>Jim_Burlant: ACELPTZ A10 ZA +24 303
#note Was going to play PUTZ but her play of WHORE killed that. Now this is where I don't entirely agree with Quackle.  I agree that LEPTA H1 31 (which I didn't know) is best.  However, among the plays I did know, the sim also likes ADZED G5 and ADZE G4; I saw those and passed because I felt that those plays were fools' gold; how would I keep the board alive if I played ADZED for 31?  It would then be impossible for me to open up the northwest quadrant.  This play was another reluctant choice made due to a perceived lack of viable options.  I thought ZA H4 was too likely to give her a comeback of GROSZ and I didn't like my chances of drawing into TROOZ.  While the only thing giving me a glimmer of hope was that she was getting cheap with the defense, this was still looking bleak - where are those I's?  LEPTA wins the sim at 24%, with ADZED G5 also at 24.  This choice sims at 12.5. 
>Cheryl_Melvin: GV 11K V.G +14 339
>Jim_Burlant: CELOPRT N12 PEC +18 321
#note Desperation. Hoping to beat her to the K and the S.  I didn't see PERIDOT or O3 CLOP.  Maybe a stylistic flaw on my end, but I felt my only real shot here was to leave O1 open and hope she couldn't draw into a big play on either opening before I did.  I don't see how I can get back into this game otherwise.  N12 POLE wins the sim at 27%, with this play coming in at 17.
>Cheryl_Melvin: AEILS O1 AISLE +34 373
#note The A in AGEE had gotten knocked off the board and was accidentally put back into the bag while we were cleaning up from a bag spill.  Neither of us had noticed this until we were double-checking our late-game tracking, when we realized that something was wrong.  We called for a director's ruling and the ruling was that  we were to play with 101 tiles but 15A was a dead spot and could not be played.  This is how Cheryl came up with the A to make this play, which effectively killed any chances I had in this game.
>Jim_Burlant: ILOORRT G5 R.. +4 325
#note Arrrrgh!!!!!  I take how many turns to draw an I and can't get one until immediately AFTER she has a play at O1?  Anyway, not much else to do but open the northwest quadrant.  GOO can wait.
>Cheryl_Melvin: EEK 15M EKE +33 406
#note Adding insult to injury, she draws the K as well.
