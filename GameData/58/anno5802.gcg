#note Looked for words under OXO and I missed one.... but this is a close 2nd. Find it?

>Matt_Canik: DEINOTZ 8L .OIN +33 219
#note Score well, shut down his easiest spot, and hold the Z for something like ZE(P)/E(Me). Didn't see DI(STILLER) but wouldn't have played it anyway.

#note (T)HING scores more. I am ashamed. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AE 9C AE +8 293
#note Obvious fish, but what can/should I do? I'll just score 30 to where his bingo ties it. 
>Matt_Canik: ADGIKOT D11 .ATIK +32 352
#note I saw DAKOIT but didn't see DAKO(I)T 4D.
>Geoff_Thevenot: EEINRRS B3 RERISEN +62 355
>Matt_Canik: ADEGOPQ A1 APOD +34 386
#note I was really worried about him getting a high-scoring play in this spot but I was also concerned about getting rid of the Q. QA(I)D N6 was mocking me. And after brief 5 studying, I try talking myself into thinking that APODE* is good. I almost lay that down here before dropping the E. That's why I didn't play it at A5 instead. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: EF A7 EF +32 387
#note Turns out, if I HAD played QA(I)D he would have had LEAF there for 44. 
>Matt_Canik: CEFGQUW C2 FEW +31 417
#note This was interesting for sure. Ultimately settle on FEW for a few reasons. a. almost entirely vowels and low scoring letters in the bag and he probably won't bingo. b. I'm guaranteed to dump the Q, either QU(AY) or QI. c. I can try and pick up a letter that allows for a 33+ point play getting the Q on the TLS on N6. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AEO O1 O.EA +18 405
>Matt_Canik: CGLOQRU F3 QU.. +16 433
#note At this point, I MUST play this and take the tie. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: AELTU 14J .LUATE +12 417
#note GG. I'll take a tie vs. Geoff any day.
