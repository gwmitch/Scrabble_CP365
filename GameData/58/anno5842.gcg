>Ryan_Fischer: AEEGSTT 8D GESTATE +70 70
#note I overdrew and he turned over AES of my total rack of AEEGSSTT.  Needless to say, he was pretty unhappy after putting the S back in the bag and watching me bingo.  Rule needs a-changing.
>Chris_Cree: AEU 7G EAU +13 13
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGNPTW 6D WEFT +21 91
>Chris_Cree: EIKRSSV K2 SKIVERS +87 100
>Ryan_Fischer: BGJNPTX 6J J.T +26 117
#note Probably should've taken JINX, but I really don't like giving such an easy comeback.  J(I)B isn't too much more appealing, hence this.
>Chris_Cree: ADELL M2 LADLE +23 123
#note Coulda been worse!
>Ryan_Fischer: ABGMNPX N1 MAX +37 154
#note He blocked MAX(I)NG, hated this, but if it's best it's best.  Oddly, PAX is better in this position, though, I guess because of fewer sidelaps.
>Chris_Cree: AM O1 AM +29 152
>Ryan_Fischer: BEFGNPP -BFGPP +0 154
#note Totally missed FE, but I guess it's best to start from almost scratch, see what we can do about those blanks.
>Chris_Cree: Q 4J Q. +11 163

>Chris_Cree: DNOU H11 .OUND +21 297
>Ryan_Fischer: BEHIINT 3A NIB +22 300
#note That's twice drawing to EINT, unable to hit anything, and he opened such a beautiful lane for me.  Very frustrating.  Saw NIB and HE(N)BIT, but not (D)IB, which is interesting.
>Chris_Cree: AEGNNOR 15F AN.ROGEN +61 358
#note Le'dammit!
>Ryan_Fischer: EHIILRT 14E THI. +30 330
#note I contemplated THI(N)E, but didn't want to lose the E, yet.  Just played off the T for an extra point, an extra shot at the blank.  LECI(THIN) has entered my consciousness.
>Chris_Cree: DIU 14L DUI +13 371
#note It's here I figure him for the blank, but he's really just blocking the easy -S bingos.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIILRR 10B LI.IER +24 354
#note AIRLI(N)ER which I saw, (G)LAIRIER which I didn't look for.  He really appreciated the novelty of my play of LI(V)IER.  Wonder what he'd've though if I found RI(V)IERA.  Just beautiful.  I came to LI(V)IER because I was trying to figure out how to create a second spot.  At first I thought LI(V)E 'cause I have the last A, but then I realized there were a ton of Os left.  It's hard, he says, to part with all those good tiles.  That pool looks ugly.  But, the bingo isn't the only way I can still win.
>Chris_Cree: OOP 13M POO +22 393
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACFILR 13G F.R +21 375
#note It's funny, one of the first stories Cree told when I first arrived is that of he and Gibson quizzing each other, Gibson reading off ACEEFILR... and before he can finish he shouts the answer.  So, I learned a word, and got the possibility not 48 hours later.  Nothing plays here, so the issue is how to fish for a fighting chance.  Given what I know, I chose wrong, but was so close.  His instinct was that I should play 2A IF.  My first choice was F(U)CI.  IF is 81% to win, F(U)CI 63, F(U)R 64.  I chose F(U)R to save for LECI(THIN), which I thought would be 28.  It's only 24.
>Chris_Cree: COW 2H COW. +17 410
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ACGILO 14A LeCI.... +24 399
#note Missed COL(L)eGIA.  It's humbling, how fast he responded when I asked him what he saw in my last rack.  He said there was a whole buncha stuff in the pool.  It was similar to my game with Bernardina earlier where I had to pick a spot to block and hope.  GIRASOL(S) was one easy possibility I'd've definitely found had I drawn into it, so he picked right in that respect.  I'm embarrassed that I missed ACOCK.  (teehee).  Well, many other viable plays.  Doubtful they'd win, though.
>Chris_Cree: IIORSU N6 SOUR +20 430
#note S(C)OUR is 4 more.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGO 12A GOA. +8 407
#note And with that, he gets one transitory monkey off his back.  After the second upset he went on and on about Scrabble "daddies" coming outta nowhere.  Apparently, I'm only his "step-daddy" now.  :)  Great game either way.
