>Ryan_Fischer: AEJLOSU 8D JOUAL +40 40
#note You wouldn't believe how fast I played this opening rack.  I first put down JOULE, then thought I was being so clever switching the E and A.  You'd be so jealous to see what I saw a second after I hit the clock and saw my leave.
>Matthew_Bernardina: GOY 9C GOY +23 23
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEEHSS I8 SHEA +24 64
#note 7G HE -- really?
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABERZ H11 ZEBRA +62 85
#note Well, when you put it that way...
>Ryan_Fischer: ACDEESY 14B DECAYE.S +94 158
>Matthew_Bernardina: DOT 10B DOT +21 106
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEINRV D12 VI.E +20 178
#note Considered RAVE briefly, but why do that without an S?  Also considered (ZA)NIER, but not (ZA)IRE.  Neither is very smart.  Hence, VI(C)E.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ILRV 12H .RVIL +24 130

#note 13B AR(I)A 17
>Matthew_Bernardina: FO J9 OF +31 161
>Ryan_Fischer: AAACENR 13A CAR.NA +30 230
#note One of my favorite finds of the tournament.

>Ryan_Fischer: AEEENOO L4 AEON +20 250
>Matthew_Bernardina: GGIMSTT -GGT +0 189
>Ryan_Fischer: BEEIOOU J2 OBOE +14 264
#note This is way down, but I like it.  Obstruct the P hook and score a few points.  Get 4 shots at the blanks.
>Matthew_Bernardina: MTT G7 M.TT +10 199
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIOUX K2 XI +22 286
#note This doesn't even rank, but I really like it 'cause all of Q's other suggestions are suicidal.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EINT 2I T..INE +26 225
#note Nice.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIKNOU 1L KUNE +54 340
#note No As left.  Ditch the U.
>Matthew_Bernardina: FM -  +0 225
#note Lost challenge.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGILOSW 1F GLIA +17 357
#note Again, GLIA doesn't even rank, but I like it because I have the last O.  Sure, there are two blanks out, but whatev.  Through an R is AI(R)GLOWS, btw.
>Matthew_Bernardina: FM 15C F.M +19 244
>Ryan_Fischer: ILOPSUW M12 SWOP +27 384
#note I thought I was being clever playing down, but he's able to circumvent it in a bit.  L10 PI(L)LOW 26.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DG 14L D.G +10 254
#note Unfortunate for me.
>Ryan_Fischer: IILNRUU F1 .URU +7 391
#note What an ugly draw.  The blank is still in the bag, too!  I saw all the candidate plays.  Ideally, I'd like to balance and set up a place to bingo back.  (HO)URI balances but sure doesn't give me that, which is why I played (G)URU.  For some weird reason, (G)URU isn't 100% to win.  Weird.

#note Not best, but s'okay.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?IR M4 IRe +16 356
#note That is best.
