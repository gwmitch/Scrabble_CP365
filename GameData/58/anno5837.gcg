#note 4A COXY is probably a little better because of the less consonant-heavy leave.

#note Lucky to get away with this phony.  I didn't think it was in our dictionary, but I was banking on it being in Collins, because I was pretty sure it was a real thing--a unit of distance.  As it happens, Nick was thinking the same thing and let it go.  Turns out that a stadion (with an "o"), is about 200 meters, but it isn't valid in any of the dictionaries.  The best real plays all involve making OBLIQUED.

#note I breathe a sigh of relief as I draw the J, only to have it followed by this other drek.  I'm hoping to set up O1 JURIES, or some other high-scoring play, assuming he blocks the 14J spot.  Sim says J4 WAI is best, winning about 37% of the time, followed by N13 WIN and F9 IWI. This was actually the only Collins word in the game.
