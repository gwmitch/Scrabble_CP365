>Ryan_Fischer: ?DEKNOS 8D DONKEyS +76 76
#note RYAN: Ironically, it's the next game versus Evans in which I play like a donkey.  Here, I just missed SNOoKED and nONSKED.
>Evans_Clinchy: ACDGHOT J2 GOTCHA. +25 25 
#note Nice play.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFLORTY 3I F.OLERY +34 110
#note RYAN: F(O)OTY is more conservative.
>Evans_Clinchy: ADEFLOR L1 FA.DEROL +84 109
#note RYAN: Nice again.  Of note: FORELA(N)D and FRE(E)LOAD.
>Ryan_Fischer: AABJOTU O1 JA. +39 149
#note Saw BA(Y)OU; keeping a J is rarely advisable.
>Evans_Clinchy: AAEEIMS F7 A.EMIA +14 123 
#note EVANS: Passed up plays at M2 (ARAME, AREA, AREAE) since they gave up a triple lane a little too easily. This seemed less reckless. 
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEOTTU D2 BATTUE. +20 169
#note EVANS: I had a feeling ABUTTED had no anagram, but I wasn't sure enough to challenge a dinky little 20-point play. Seemed better to just bingo and keep outrunning. 
>Evans_Clinchy: AEEIRST H8 .ATERIES +77 200
>Ryan_Fischer: NNOUUYZ 8L .UNY +21 190
#note RYAN: I was really lost here.  Missed YU(T)Z and (S)OYUZ, both questionable.
>Evans_Clinchy: EIIINOP 12H .IPIENI +18 218 
#note EVANS: Better than RIPIENO, since it takes no hooks. 
>Ryan_Fischer: DMNNOUZ G5 ZON. +21 211
#note ZON(K) doesn't even appear as a suggestion, but I was okay with it.  Q says M(A)UND.  I don't know.
>Evans_Clinchy: EEELOWX 11J OX +40 258 
#note EVANS: Didn't much like ELBOW 2B, since it opens a TWS rather recklessly and I'm not holding any of the A's or O's to overlap that W next turn. It came down to one of the 40-point X plays, either here or at E10, and I chose this one because it sets up TEW for 30 next turn.
>Ryan_Fischer: DHIMNTU E10 HM +29 240
>Evans_Clinchy: EEEILNW 10H .EW +30 288 
>Ryan_Fischer: DGINRTU 14B UNGIRT.D +74 314
#note When you can't play a real word, it's okay to make one up.  EVANS: This is already a really bad phony to accept, but it's even worse when you consider I can put the game away by challenging and playing LESIONED. What am I thinking? 
>Evans_Clinchy: DEEILNO 2B LO.ED +24 312
#note He told me he had LE(S)IONED ready to go in that spot.  Good play here.  Keeps me on my feet, changes what I was gonna play (WA(I)VES N9).  EVANS: Either this or DOBIE makes the most sense, I think. Gotta keep a decent leave and open a line. 
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEGSVW 1E WAVE +38 352
#note Not gonna play scared.  I'll kill the G hook in a minute.
>Evans_Clinchy: EILNPRR N10 PL.ER +26 338 
#note Missing PURLINE M7, which at least gives me a fighting chance. Probably sunk anyway. 
>Ryan_Fischer: ABCGIIS C1 C.B +22 374
#note RYAN: Really wish I could have played 3 tiles here.  C(O)B is way down on the list, but I was happy with it.  Champ says B(R)IG wins 72%?  I saw it, but had my doubts.  If QV is in the bag I'm in trouble, which is why C(O)B is decent, I think.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?INORUV 5A VIR.U +16 354 
#note EVANS: Short on time, I think that this forces him into QI B4, and maybe I can race out with a big A5 play like VINOS and win 389-385. I really, seriously expected to win this game. Had no idea he could play QIS in the bottom-right, just didn't have enough time to notice that. Although I doubt it matters... the game doesn't look winnable from down 36.  RYAN: I also have QA(T) 4H
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIIQSS 15L QIS +30 404
>Evans_Clinchy: ?NOT A5 .eNT +18 372
#note N2 f(R)ONT 14  EVANS: Extremely short on time, terrible play, not that it matters.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGIS C11 GAI.S +12 416
>Ryan_Fischer:  (O) +2 418
