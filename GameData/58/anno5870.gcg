>Matthew: ?DEEKTV 8F EKED +18 18
#note Tsk... so EKT? yields more bingos? Or is the bad defense after EKED the main factor? DEV wins the sim.

#note I talked myself out of RHEME and convinced myself it was just RHEUM. Not good. Bad mistake. FLEXOR there is 45. Am I trying to be defensive with FLOUR? What threat is that U posing, exactly. Awful.

#note I spent about 8-9 minutes on this position. Nothing looks appealing. 26 points for OXIDS is definitely worth burning the S on this board, but I have no reason to and no interest in opening the board. Dean needs a bingo to win, so I'm not going to help him do it.

#note OXIDS might make more sense now. IRRR, though. Tsk.

>Matthew: IINRRSU N1 URI. +12 295
#note Okay. So I'm going to make him take a baby bingo to this R, or he's gonna bingo off KEN and I'll get this triple. That was my logic at least. I think I completely didn't see UNCI.

#note This just gives Dean a chance for a big play ending in AN or ON. 14I SPRAIN or 2F PANSY.
