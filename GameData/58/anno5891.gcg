>Matthew_Larocque: DDEHLNO 9G HOLD +21 21
#note Didn't know this bingo.
>Mike_Ebanks: ABGM F8 GAMB +24 54
#note Didn't know this one, but left it.
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINOU 8A DOEIN. +27 48
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINOU --  -27 21
#note Not sure what I was thinking here. I really wanted to play audio, but it left such a dangerous opening. So I tried a very unconvincing non-word.
>Mike_Ebanks: DEZ 10J ZED +66 120
#note This was painful. This was my second of THREE chances to win first place, and I did some epic choking!
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEINOU E11 AUDIO +20 41
#note With the adz hook this felt a little less dangerous.
>Mike_Ebanks: EFHN 15D F.EHN +45 165
#note Nice play. I hesitated, but then I did remember fohn having an alternate spelling.
>Matthew_Larocque: ENORRSV 11H OVER +32 73
>Mike_Ebanks: ACO 9L OCA +15 180
>Matthew_Larocque: EIKNRST O3 REKNITS +92 165
#note Well then.... that was nice of him. Could he possibly challenge reknits?
>Mike_Ebanks: AT -  +0 180
#note Yes, yes he can.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEINQWX 13B QAI. +28 193
#note Trying to figure out how to score points for both the Q and the X here...
>Mike_Ebanks: AT B13 .AT +24 204
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNWX 12D X. +36 229
#note I didn't play waxing? Wow. :/
>Mike_Ebanks: EY A14 YE +26 230
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNRW N9 .WNIER +34 263
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNRW --  -34 229
#note I thought this might be good; I thought he would too. Oops.
>Mike_Ebanks: INOU 6K UNIO. +7 237
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILNRW 8A WARIN. +33 262
#note I was unsure of waling or lawing, but felt good about waring. Earwig never came into my head.
>Mike_Ebanks: ??EJRRU 14H inJURER +107 344
#note And I thought zed was painful - awesome play by him though.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEELST C2 BLEATE.S +74 336
#note Funny story. I had the rack BELATER in a previous game this tournament, and didn't know the bingo, so I checked after. And what do you know!
>Mike_Ebanks: EFGILNT 4A FL.ETING +86 430
#note He held the play briefly before nullifying any ground I made up. It was pretty funny actually.
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIOTW H1 TWI. +24 360
#note I was blanking pretty hard here. I was playing my hardest, trying to make a comeback for the ages, but he shut me down. All I could do was hope for an unlikely bingo up top.
>Mike_Ebanks: MTU 5K MUT +22 452
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGIOOR 3J GOOIE. +14 374
#note Goof is obviously what I need to play here - more points, and a chance to get a bingo I might recognize (niteries or something). I think my time was almost out, though, as it usually is.
>Mike_Ebanks: CIO A1 COI. +27 479
>Matthew_Larocque: EPRSS O11 PRESS +37 411
#note Wow, out of 3 tiles left, 2 were S. That helped immensely.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ADNP) +14 425
#note Fun game, and I don't feel bad about the loss at all.
