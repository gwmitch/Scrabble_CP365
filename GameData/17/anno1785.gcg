>Glenn_Dunlop: AKLRSTY I8 STARKLY +76 76
#note My misfortunes continue.
>Ryan_Fischer: EGJNRSS F6 JE.RS +30 48
#note Best, though I'm sure other options are worth considering to better the landscape of the board.
>Glenn_Dunlop: BBDEI 11H B.IBED +22 98
>Ryan_Fischer: AGHNRST 10I .H +26 74
#note Best, I'm happy to report.
>Glenn_Dunlop: EGRT L8 GRE.T +16 114
#note Though of course my bingo gets blocked.
>Ryan_Fischer: AGMNRST 8L .RAM +21 95
#note Missed G(Y)MNAST for 38, or S(Y)NTAGM (its anagram) for 30.  I considered G(Y)M, but it leaves easy O plays.  Might be worth it for the cool ANRST leave.  Not after what he does next though.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ELY 9L .ELY +20 134
#note Wow, what a horrible, play.
>Ryan_Fischer: GNNQSTU 13L SUQ +31 126
#note It's this or exchanging.  Wondering, when am I gonna catch a break.
>Glenn_Dunlop: DNOU E8 .OUND +20 154
>Ryan_Fischer: EGNNOOT 14B ONTOGEN. +82 208
#note Well, there's a break, without a certain sandbagger's tutelage, I wouldn't have caught.  Thx, CBB!
>Glenn_Dunlop: OTW 15A TWO +25 179
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEEOSU -EEEOU +0 208
#note *cries*
>Glenn_Dunlop: CIT 14M TIC +34 213
>Ryan_Fischer: ADELNRS 15G DE +18 226
#note Score twice as many points as any of the other dumps, and hope to draw one of the two blanks or five Es.  A guy can dream, right?  Though, with that earlier shit, where will I put a bingo?  LA might do a little better than DE, hard to say.
>Glenn_Dunlop: AOV 13A AVO +27 240
>Ryan_Fischer: AGHLNRS 12A HA +28 254
#note Best, though not very pretty.
>Glenn_Dunlop: EIP D10 PIE +23 263
#note Beyond me why he would open it up, though I relish the slight glimmer of a hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: GIILNRS 6F .IG +11 265
#note LI(MY) O6 is just brilliant.  My play, not so much, though I was trying to let the board breathe.  I think I have pretty good board vision most of the time, but I wonder what it's going to take to consistently find plays such as this.  I have the last S, but yes, both blanks are still out, so it could bite me.
>Glenn_Dunlop: DEI 12G DI.E +21 284
>Ryan_Fischer: IIILNRS H1 RILIN. +24 289
#note I decide to take a risk and blow it wide open, now with a hook elsewhere as slight backup.  He can't have both blanks yet, can he?
>Glenn_Dunlop: ACNV 2G V.NCA +16 300
#note Grrrr.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINORS N1 ERASION.. +72 361
#note Do I get points for creativity at least?
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINORS --  -72 289
#note No?  Didn't think so.  Okay, so what SHOULD I have done there?  Dump the O at O(PUS), killing the hook, or dump another tile elsewhere, keeping a suboptimal leave that will at least go with the board better?
>Glenn_Dunlop: EIMOX 1K MOXIE +49 349
#note Double grrrr.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINORS 2M IN +17 306
#note I got nuthin'.  And in a game I should have won easily, a tight board suffocates me.  I was LOOKING for a cutesy play at O12, and AS(C)I is it.  Just couldn't conjure up the word in time.
>Glenn_Dunlop: AEFOUWZ 4G W.Z +15 364
#note ...
>Ryan_Fischer: AEOORST I4 .A +13 319
#note This is a fish for OESTRIO(L) 3A which I wouldn't see him finding or blocking in a million years.  All I have to do is hope he hasn't lucked into BOTH blanks.
>Glenn_Dunlop: ??A 4G ...Ard +32 396
#note Damn, damn, Damn, DAMN, DAMN!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEOORST 3C STERO. +24 343
#note This is creative, missing AEROSO(L) or the champ's pick, RETOO(L), leaving AS.
>Glenn_Dunlop: AEFUU 1F FA.E +19 415
#note Blocks my best out.
>Ryan_Fischer: AO F13 A.O +8 351
#note Le sigh.
>Ryan_Fischer:  (UU) +4 355
