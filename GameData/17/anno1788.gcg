#note Remember kids, just because a word is cool, it doesn't mean that it's the right play. I should have looked longer for better options. 13F PO(L)ITICS 78 and 13F CO(L)PITIS 82 (didn't know it) are among the better choices.

#note Rushed again. While 96 points normally should be satisfactory, I shouldn't play so fast. Yes it may have seemed counterintuitive to look through the G, but I should have anyway...
