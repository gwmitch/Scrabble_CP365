#note RATAFEE for 40.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?EEEOOP 10E OPE +16 30
>annagraham: AAEKMRT 11E MARK +38 57
#note KERATOMA for 106!
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?EEOOSY 12F YE +20 50
#note Didn't see L8 SOOEY 27, but I don't even think it's worth it.
>annagraham: ABEMNTV K7 M.VEN +20 77
#note H11 KNAVE 46. Three straight big misses; I better win this one!
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?ELNOOS L2 NOOdLES +77 127
>annagraham: ABEINRT 3G BARIT.NE +78 155
#note Neat, INBREAT(HE) plays, too (the anagram of HIBERNATE).
>Brendan_Sullivan: GIJOOTY H1 JI.O +36 163
>annagraham: LORTUWZ L10 LUTZ +30 185
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEGORTY 13I GRA.E +34 197
#note Whoops, didn't spot GYOZA.
>annagraham: INORUUW -OUUW +0 185
>Brendan_Sullivan: AGNOTUY J11 GO.Y +20 217
#note I thought this move was okay, and I still kinda like it. I don't think I could ever bring myself to play 9A GUYOT or GOUTY, the top simming moves, especially with this score. Maybe D6 GUYOT if I had seen it.
>annagraham: AEIINRT N1 IN.RTIAE +70 255
>Brendan_Sullivan: AANTUUW O8 TUNA +18 235
#note Nothing looked appetizing here. TAW/NAW score 6 more but ANUU or ATUU is ugly. 10B AUT(OPE)N 19 is intriguing.
>annagraham: DDDEHSU D8 DUD +14 269
#note Not playing it at N13 for defensive reasons, I guess?
>Brendan_Sullivan: AACDNUW N13 DAW +31 266
#note Now I know CAUDAD. It plays at 8A.
>annagraham: BDEHPRS 15L HE.S +42 311
>Brendan_Sullivan: AACINQU 8A QUA. +42 308
>annagraham: BDELOPR 9C B.D +22 333
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACFINOT O1 FA +32 340
>annagraham: ELOPRVX 2J PE. +23 356
#note Hmm, why this move? 12C OXE(YE) is best. J2 VIPER/VIRL are next, with reasonable leaves with the X.
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEINORT 14H CO. +11 351
#note Really didn't know what to do here. I'm very close to a bingo, but there will be nowhere to put it. But I didn't see anything that scored more than a dozen points. I considered B4 CORNU 9 for a sec, since it sorta opened things up. 7I TO(ME) 16 sims best with 11C RE(MARK) 18 right behind it.
>annagraham: ELORSVX 13B VOLES +25 381
>Brendan_Sullivan: CEINRTT I6 EC.. +12 363
#note A last, desperate attempt to open up a bingo spot. I need IS, S? or I? to hit NITRITES . . .
>annagraham: GILRSWX 6H L.X +26 407
#note . . . and I get it, but it's easily blocked.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?IINRTT B10 TRI.eT +20 383
#note Best.
>annagraham: GIRSW G5 WIG +20 427
>Brendan_Sullivan: IN N10 IN +10 393
#note I was never in control this game, always trying to catch up.
>Brendan_Sullivan:  (RS) +4 397
