>Marty_Gabriel: EGUV E7 V.GUE +18 18
>Steve_Grob: ACGMSTT 10A CATG.T +13 49
#note GAMUT in the same spot scores an extra point and is less dangerous.
>Marty_Gabriel: EEJLL I3 JELLE. +23 41
>Steve_Grob: ABEMNOS B5 AMOEB.NS +68 117
#note Lucky to get away with this phoney after a long hold. If only the J was over one to the left. CABMEN is the best of the legal plays.
>Marty_Gabriel: AEF A8 FA.E +48 89
>Steve_Grob: DORTUUU 12B .OUR +18 135
#note Maybe an exchange is in order; on the lead I'm more apt to try and play through a bad rack.
>Marty_Gabriel: APY C5 YAP +27 116
>Steve_Grob: ADOTUUX 4I .AUX +22 157
>Marty_Gabriel: ??CDEIN K4 .NpICkED +86 202
#note Marty took a long time to make this play.
>Steve_Grob: DOTTTTU -DOTTTU +0 157
#note Q says TOUT for 13 at L10, but I'm ready to start anew. Duck likes keeping a D among exchange plays, perhaps to place at 5A.
>Marty_Gabriel: EIPRV A1 VIPER +39 241
>Steve_Grob: AEFIMST J10 FIT +30 187
#note Surpising (to me) Q championship player prefers FA in same spot, despite six Is still in the bag to just two As. The MITES leave is that powerful.
>Marty_Gabriel: ILLR 3A .RILL +14 255
>Steve_Grob: AEEIMRS D1 MI.E +18 205
>Marty_Gabriel: OZ J2 ZO. +41 296
#note Ouch. Appears to be the first nail in the coffin.
>Steve_Grob: AAEIRST 2J .AIRE +28 233
#note Embarrassing miss.
>Marty_Gabriel: QSU O2 SUQ +37 333
#note Another nail in the coffin.
>Steve_Grob: AINNRST H8 .NTRAINS +77 310
#note Not dead yet.
>Marty_Gabriel: EORW 1D .OWER +30 363
>Steve_Grob: ABEINOT 15A NIOBATE. +89 399
#note Miracle pull good for a bango and puts me in front.
>Marty_Gabriel: DGIOSTW L11 STOW +18 381
#note Marty must be a little groggy after the 1-2 punch. He's also in time trouble. Same play scores five more at F3 and 3 more at 13J. Championship player plays TOD at 1L.
>Steve_Grob: DHHOO M13 HOD +29 428
