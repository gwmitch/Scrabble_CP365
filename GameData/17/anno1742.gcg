>Quacklissimus: ADEEOUW 8G WOE +12 12
>Magrathean: ACEMOPT 7F COMP +31 31
#note thought of COMPLEAT, forgot about MERCAPTO (might have seen it if the R were there) and didn't know COPEMATE at all. sweet word. COMP is the best of the nonbingos. 32/32
>Quacklissimus: ADEOOUU -AOOUU +0 12
>Magrathean: AEIORRT 9G ERA +23 54
#note a tough move with lots of options. The other best are TERAI (which I saw) and EAR (which I somehow didn't). TERIA seems to win by a smidgeon. 1/33
>Quacklissimus: DEFHILW 10G DELF +36 48
>Magrathean: AEIJORT J6 JO +36 90
#note I forget COMPO sometimes, but not now. 0/33
>Quacklissimus: AEHIIVW K4 WHOSO +43 91
>Magrathean: AAEIRRT L6 TERAI +32 122
#note At first I thought that EATER went down for 50+ points with all 1-pointers, but at least I chose the best play that wasn't imaginary. 0/33
>Quacklissimus: AEIIINV J10 .UGIO +11 102
>Magrathean: AILORSV 13G RAV.OLIS +82 204
#note good thing I kept looking after seeing VOLAR for a bunch. 0/33
>Quacklissimus: AEIINTV L1 FYKE +46 148
>Magrathean: ADEIINT 12A INEDITA +70 274
#note More fun with the new inference engine - I decided to assume opponent has a blank (i.e. worst case scenario) to see if the other two plays would catch up, and it looks like DAINTIES in fact has a higher winning percentage by a hair. My god, this is the most useful innovation since the shot clock. Not sure if this is accurate analysis or not, in that INEDITA wins the regular sim, but if you want to win you assume the worst, and this is how you assume the worst. Let's call it 4/37 given my old ad hoc of 3 equity per win percent before the preendgame.
>Quacklissimus: ?ALLPRS A8 SPiR.LLA +131 279

>Quacklissimus: AADENSU 1A .ANDEAUS +89 491
>Magrathean: AERTVXY C11 V.XT +28 439
#note in an actual game I might play VEE at C11, hoping to draw the R for LARYNX. But it's only 71 with a 1/4 chance of hitting it, so I suppose I'd have to do the math and see if the other plays catch up if I miss. Quackle says that VEX is best and that VEXT is 10 points worse, and I have to go pack so no time to check. Against some players I would still play VEXT and hope that they somehow miss HERTZ and let me go out with DENARY/DREAMY...actually wish I could look at the endgames and see why VEX is so much better. 10/47
>Quacklissimus: BEMNRTZ 4A ..RTZ +34 525
>Magrathean: AENRY 5E AY +32 471
#note I didn't even see ANY at the same spot, but it's 1 better than AY thanks to RECOMPOSE! for the nongifted, my sequence is best.
>Quacklissimus: BEMN O7 ME +22 547
>Magrathean: ENR 3L .ERN +16 487
#note ending with 47 equity points again, 30some from the bingo I didn't know, 5 from a foolhardy placement of a bingo which did indeed come back to bite me, and 10 from the preendgame when it didn't matter too much
>Magrathean:  (BN) +8 495
#note overall that's 23+48.5+47=117.5/3=39 or so points of equity lost per game. sure, that's not the end all be all of life, but if I can keep that level up at nationals I'll be pretty happy. I'll be happier still if I don't miss anything easy like OBTAINS.
