>Jesse_M: ?DNRRWZ -DNRRWZ +0 0
#note My exchange deservedly gets a "What the deuce?" from me in retrospect. Quackle suggests changing RWZ is optimal
>David_Gibson: EMR 8G REM +10 10
>Jesse_M: ?EGHRSS J6 GuSHERS +72 72
#note J2 GiRSHES and GuRSHES 78 both sim higher (would help to actually know both those words, too)

#note Quackle suggests G6 VA(R)Y 15 or M6 UNAI 18 are slightly better. I don't like UNAI at all, but VARY I might consider.

>Jesse_M: AALNORY 1G ROYAL +54 220
#note I was so excited about having an O that I didn't look longer for a better play than ROYAL. Yes, I know the word that scores 66, and yes, I am an idiot for not taking the time to look for it...
