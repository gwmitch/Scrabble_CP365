>chaithedog: ?DEGPXZ 8G ZEP +28 28
#note This one is really neat. 8G is the "obvious" placement, but 8F sims a full 4 points better! Carl pointed this out to me, and I first guessed that he'd benefit greatly from an A draw. Actually, he's better off if I have an A! As long as he gets any vowel, he'll get a big X play at F10.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADMRRSS J4 DRAMS +25 25
#note Thought this was one of those times to undouble the S, but 9E DRAM 24 is actually best; it's too easy for him to score a bunch there.
>chaithedog: ?DGHLNX H7 H.X +13 41
#note 6H GL(A)ND 7 sims rather well. I guess if he draws an A, AX/ZA would score well, and even if I play there, he can just dump the X with ZAX.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIINRSU I8 .IU +16 41
>chaithedog: ?DEFGLN 6I F.NGED +15 56
#note G6 FEZ 22 sims a bit better.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AGINNRS M6 .ARNINGS +72 113
>chaithedog: ?ADILLW 8L D.AW +30 86
#note 4G/4C WILDLAND 76. This is next best.

>chaithedog: ?ILLORU 4G LOU.LIeR +68 154
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?CEEIRS O8 .ISEaCRE +86 210
#note I think I found this one so easily because my dad always told me, "Don't be such a wiseacre," when I was a kid. Well, he still does, actually.
>chaithedog: BEIOOTU 3L BOO +18 172
#note 3L OBOE 22 sims a little better. There are still tons of vowels left.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ACEFMTV J10 MAC +23 233
#note Wow, I completely didn't look at hooking BOO. That's pathetic. O1 FEM 32 is best.
>chaithedog: BEEISTU O1 TUB +23 195
>Brendan_Sullivan: EFJOTTV 2K JOT +17 250
#note Thought about H1 VETO 21, but I wanted to dump the J. 13I JET 26 is interesting, with me holding an O; however, there are only one D and 3 Rs and one S to be drawn. Ultimately, the sim favors 13 G VOTE 20. The V shuts that side down, and there's a chance I can cash the J on the DLS/TWS combo.

>Brendan_Sullivan: EELOOTU G6 LE. +19 322
#note This is going to be a tough board to work with . . .
>chaithedog: AEEENRW L12 AE +12 322
#note Neither one of us wants to open anything.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEKOOTU 14N O. +8 330
#note Hmm, I really took a while on this one. Nothing jumped out as a good move. Maybe exchanging is right, but what do I keep and why? Can't he just reply with an exchange? Then where do I stand? I could play OK(AY) or OK(EH), but that gives him easy ways to score. I picked this move eventually just because it scored a little bit, and it also seemed like a spot he could take next turn to avoid opening up the board, as well. In fact, this move shows about 48% wins after 13000 iterations of a many-ply sim, just ahead of a bunch of the exchange options (the best of which is keeping the K, interestingly enough).
>chaithedog: AEENRWY K11 ER +15 337
#note Doing just what I'm doing, scoring a bit while not giving anything back. Quackle likes playing at F5 though, either WAY or RAY. If I have the H, I can play there and take away all of his scoring opportunities.
>Brendan_Sullivan: AEKNOTU G1 ON +13 343
#note Similar to my previous turn, this is neither my best scoring opportunity nor my best leave, but I think it gives me the best chance of winning from here. Quackle seems to agree, but I'm not sure sims are all that helpful on this kind of clogged board. It also likes 1E ENUF 7; I have no idea why. Maybe it induces him into playing on Row 2 and then I can get the TWS? Isn't he smarter than that?
>chaithedog: AEINTWY F5 WAY +24 361
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADEHKTU E4 HAD +28 371
#note E1 KHEDA 36 really scores, but if he has NITRITE, then game over. I thought HAD gave me a shot, but it's rather easy for him to make a parallel play an leave me with nothing. H12 KI is intriguing; it forces him to make a move and give me something back potentially. A sim shows 100% wins (!), but with perfect endgame play, I can only win if E/N/R/T is in the bag, so it's really only a 5/8 chance. Plus, the endgames are really tricky and long, so I'd doubtlessly screw them up somehow. I recommend looking through the whole sequence after KI, with each of EINRT in the bag. It's fun!
>chaithedog: EIINRTT D1 INTER +28 389
#note I thought this was smart, trying to lure me into playing the overlap KUE which gives him TIKI for the out. NITER in the same spot, though, will net him 1 more point. In that case, the sidelap* UKE is my best play, and he gets 2A TI(KI) for the out.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIKTU 2B KU.E +16 387
#note This was the best I could find that didn't give him a big outplay. The best move is actually 2C INK for 7, since he has no outs from there; he plays 1C TI 4, I play 3B TET 12, he gets I3 VIE 6 and out for an 11 point win. KUNE leads to an 18 point loss . . .
>chaithedog: IT 3A TI +8 397
#note  . . . well, a 14 point loss if he doesn't spot C1 TUI for 12. This was a fun game; a close score on a closed board always makes it challenging.
