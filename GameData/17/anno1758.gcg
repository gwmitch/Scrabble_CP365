>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEEOS -EEO +0 0
#note After 500 iterations, this barely wins out over keeping DES.
>Luise_Shafritz: II -II +0 0
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGILS 8D GLIADES +72 72
#note I'm not gonna give up this rack so easily when she's probably close to one herself, so I'm just seeing if she's awake.  She has a choice: let mine stay, or avoid giving me a 2x2 or TLS if at all possible.  Throwing the G back, AG, or DIG, is probably more sane.  The rack isn't THAT great.
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGILS --  -72 0
#note Challenged off, of course.
>Luise_Shafritz: DEINRST 8B TINDERS +68 68
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEGILS B1 GLADIES. +74 74
#note Net of 6, though I am behind on the draw.
>Luise_Shafritz: ??BNORZ H1 BRONZer. +104 172
#note Yep, serves me right.
>Ryan_Fischer: EILNUWW 3A W.W +18 92
#note Best after 100 spins.  I'm not about to play WIN(Z)E leaving LUW.  Seems insane down so much.
>Luise_Shafritz: AEIRRT E5 TAR.IER +32 204
#note It's a nice play for her, and beneficial for me as it burns her good tiles and exposes two TLSes.
>Ryan_Fischer: EIILNUX F4 NIX +53 145
#note Thank you!
>Luise_Shafritz: HJOS D1 JOSH +54 258
#note Ow.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEEIILU 5H .EAL +26 171
#note This is like 3rd after 100 spins.  Unlike an earlier rack, I can't justify passing up 26 points.  My play isn't very good defensively either, but there are no blanks to be had, so I'm left to rely on a bit of luck here.  The options that sim ahead in the short term are throwing in EIIU or AU(R)EI 2F for 9.
>Luise_Shafritz: AYY 6J YAY +32 290
>Ryan_Fischer: EFIIRTU 2G F.UITIER +76 247
#note What are the odds?
>Luise_Shafritz: DEM 1M MED +24 314
>Ryan_Fischer: EEGIOPT 3M GET +23 270
#note Sims best.  I didn't like dumping my second E even though leaving three vowels to one consonant is risky.
>Luise_Shafritz: CEUV 10B CUV.E +18 332
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIOOP A3 .OP +17 287
#note Very tough choice.  First top choice generated, (C)OOPED B10, gives up too much.  I need to slow the game down a bit here.  Quackle likes D8 (N)O(V)AE.  I don't see how that leaves me in too much better shape.  CUVEE really hurt, as there's only one or two spots for bingos.
>Luise_Shafritz: AF D6 FA. +21 353
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEEIO D10 .OE +14 301
#note Create another place for where I hope to play the case S.
>Luise_Shafritz: NO E1 ON +13 366
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEINQ 1J QI +24 325
#note Bobbin' and weavin'...
>Luise_Shafritz: LU G2 .LU +13 379
>Ryan_Fischer: AACDENO 4J CAD +23 348
#note Key play.  (T)ACNODE obviously scores best, but pretty much surrenders, killing all the work I've put into my rack.  It's for that reason I chose CAD, and I'm pretty happy with the decision.
>Luise_Shafritz: AEMOSTT M6 STOMATE +73 452
#note Ugh.  I held only because I was calculating and unsure of either.  Those 3s that do and don't take Ses are tricky, yet I was 99% sure both words were good, and I was just trying to figure out if I could still eke out a win if I play the right word through the O.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINOPR 8L P.ON +27 375
#note And yes, this is the right word to play through the O.  Sims best, but the draw I get is surely a miracle.
>Luise_Shafritz: IKNOV 12H INVOK. +28 480
#note And even more miraculously she doesn't block, thinking an out in two will do.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGHILR O8 .ARGHILE +98 473
#note :)
>Ryan_Fischer:  (ABEU) +12 485
#note I liked the part where I bingoed out to win by 5.  The funny thing is, SHE got the $20 prize that round for high loss because she misplayed the endgame.  Gives you food for thought about how fair those silly prizes are.  Interestingly, I first played this word in the exact same position, as a natural, to bingo out versus Thomas Hall back in Atlantic City last summer.  It wasn't for the win, but it definitely made a loss much closer.
