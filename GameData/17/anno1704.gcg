#title Played on August 12th, 2007.
>Brendan: DEELTTV 8G VET +12 12
#note VETTED or VELDT would be better.
>Opponent: EGLMOTU J7 MOGUL +17 17
>Brendan: DEELOTT K10 TOTED +18 30
>Opponent: AEEFIJT K4 JEFE +32 49
>Brendan: AEILRSU 14G RESI.UAL +72 102
#note Only one.
>Opponent: AEISSTW 15D WITES +44 93
#note Tons of 40ish S plays here. Probably wise to take this hotspot first, blocking a possible huge X play. Assuming I haven't drawn any of S??, he'll probably get to play something with RESIDUALS next turn.
>Brendan: AIORTXY L2 IXORA +49 151
>Opponent: AAIRSSW 2J WA.RS +32 125
#note 7H WA(ME)S scores the same and keeps the R.
>Brendan: ?HINRTY 15L THIN +34 185
#note Missing the only bingo, N8 THORNILY 63. Plus, TYIN is better.
>Opponent: AACDIOS 1H OCA +20 145
>Brendan: ?CDPRRY 2F CRY +19 204
#note This move was weirdly defensive, since I'm holding a blank. 13H RoP(E)RY 49 isn't worth it (not like I saw it, either). The best plays seem to be CRY/COCA, 6K (FA)RCY and H10 CYPR(ES). Had I known the word and seen it, I'd play CYPRES.
>Opponent: ADINQSV 13D QADI +19 164
>Brendan: ?DEGLPR M4 GED +26 230
#note Yuck, missing N2 SPLURGED 63 and H2 REPLEDGE 62. This is next best.
>Opponent: EIMNNSV E10 VIN. +14 178
#note Or VEND. There are a few Es left to be had.
>Brendan: ?LOPRTU M12 OP.. +18 248
#note I actually saw POULT(ERE)RS! I had been half-looking at this spot during his turn, and somewhere during mine I found this word. However, I couldn't remember what POULTER meant. Is it a verb? Can someone be a POULTERER? Turns out they both mean the same thing: one who deals in poultry. With this score, I really should have taken a shot at it. Even if it comes off, I'm up a bingo, holding a blank. Ah well, what could have been . . . Anyway, PRUT(AH) is a little better than OP(AH).
>Opponent: ADEMNRS F2 .REAM +15 193
#note MEAND(ERE)RS! Wonder if he looked in that spot . . .
>Brendan: ?LORTUZ 12K .R.OZ +48 296
>Opponent: DEFNNSU E5 FUND +30 223
>Brendan: ?HLLPTU O9 PUT. +15 311
#note O7 HaLUT(Z) 51 pretty much seals the deal. I didn't seriously look for blank plays, though.
>Opponent: AEENNNS 6D N..EN +7 230
>Brendan: ?ABHILL 10E .ILL +9 320
#note Didn't see H8 HALID 30, but why open up bingo lanes? I didn't foresee bingoing myself with any of these leaves, so I just decided to block the most likely bingo spots, thru the V and I.
>Opponent: ?AEGKNS 8A KNEA. +33 263
>Brendan: ?ABEHIO B1 BOHEmIA. +78 398
#note Lucky me. The only bingo.
>Opponent: ?ABGISY A1 AY +32 295
#note I'm going out, so 1A ABBeYS 46 is worth it.
>Brendan: EO 3B .OE +12 410
#note N6 OE is 2 more.
>Brendan:  (BGIS?) +14 424
