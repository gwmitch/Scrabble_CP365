>Steve_Grob: CDGGIRY 6F CR.GGY +23 23
#note Duck likes BIGGY best, by five. Interesting, since it leaves three consonants and turns over one less tile.
>Nigel_Richards: ?EEILNO 4F LO.ElINE +68 94
>Steve_Grob: ADDHIRS 3K HID +27 50
#note Next best, after the missed bingo. Tsktsk.

>Nigel_Richards: IIIIII -  +0 150
#note Nigel exchanges six tiles.
>Steve_Grob: DFLRSTT -DFLT +0 108
#note FL(IN)T is preferred by Q. This is second.
>Nigel_Richards: NWY 6M WYN +42 192
#note The game is starting to get away from me.
>Steve_Grob: EEMRSTW J8 SEW +27 135
#note Not knowing the front hooks for GAL cost me big time this game. MEWS up top is 10 more. W(HI)T(Y) is best, however, and I saw that, but talked myself out of it, thinking it was maybe only WHITEY. I tend to do that against the very high rated players. That's bad. You can't play scared and hope to win against the best.
>Nigel_Richards: AAFK O6 .AKFA +36 228
>Steve_Grob: AEIMRTU N10 MUTER +36 171
#note This falls way down the list of top plays. IMARET one spot above is almost nine valuation points better. Best is ITERUM at 1D.
>Nigel_Richards: ACNOORS 11E RACOONS +93 321
#note I wonder if he saw CANORO(U)S for 90. Regardless, I'm toast.
>Steve_Grob: ADEIIOT 1C IODATE +39 210
>Steve_Grob: ADEIIOT --  -39 171
#note So sad.

>Nigel_Richards: BOP 10D BOP +25 346
>Steve_Grob: ADEIIOT 1A IDIOT +30 201
#note A turn late.
>Nigel_Richards: EHP 12D PEH +27 373
>Steve_Grob: AADEIUU -AIUU +0 201
#note IDEA at O12 is better by a couple points.
>Nigel_Richards: ?ELNORT 13H RONdEL.T +66 439

>Nigel_Richards: AEUX A7 EAUX +41 480

#note Not entirely sure this was the rack, not that it matters much.
>Nigel_Richards: EILSV 13A LEVIS +24 504
>Steve_Grob: ADEIITU 2J TAD +16 315
#note Again I talk myself out of the best play, not being sure of HIDED; I wanted to be sure to get over 300. Afterwards Nigel said he didn't think HIDED was good, then added: "I don't know all the words, but I'm glad that you think I do."
