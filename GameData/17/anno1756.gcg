#note I did not know (or remember?) that RONYON could be spelled like that.  It plays nicely at F7, but the defensive value of my play is so high that sim favors it by about a point.

#note The only plays I really considered were UVULA, UVULAR, and VAU/TOURISTA.  I preferred playing off both U's, but I was really on the fence about whether to play off the R for three extra points.  I think I probably made the wrong call, but it turns out that sim favors a play I didn't see at all: VICAR M9.  Not only does it score heftily, but there is a nice place to dump the U's with UNAU H6 as insurance against a tough draw.

#note One of my favorite words that I had never yet gotten to play in Scrabble.  I think I have eaten it though.

>Dave: BEINSTV A4 VIBES +50 216
#note VIBE at A6 for seven points less is quite reasonable, especially because the S could be handy both for plays at C1 and 15A.  Once again, though, I played in the "take the points" style.

#note I think these are the kinds of plays that separate Bricap from someone like me.  My move is totally logical and a good find, if it weren't for the fact that there's something a thousand times better.

#note I missed two bingos: WELDMENT, which I did not know, and MILDEWED, which I did not see.  I was not too worried about bingoing right away, because I could see that I would have better tiles in the endgame than he would.  Nonetheless, I didn't like emptying the bag with MEWLED L1, nor even leaving one with MEWED L2, because I though these gave too many scoring responses back to him.  I also noticed the potentially nice score of KUFI 2B and decided to take it out, while trying to keep good bingo letters.

>Dave: ?EEIKLM L1 MILKE. +34 388
#note I thought that I probably had a bingo here, but I knew that it was going to be a word I was not sure of.  So I looked for a way to win without bingoing.  I thought I would win comfortably with this, but I missed Mark's really big next play.  Turns out the only bingo is GEMLIKE.  I only thought of HEMLIKE* and ELMLIKE*.

#note Great play!  Fortunately, I have just enough to hang on.
