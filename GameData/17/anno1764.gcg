#note The clear sim winner.  FEUAR is 3.3 back, and -AFOOU is 3.7 back.

>Dave: ?EEEEEG 8K GEE +16 60
#note I had been ready to exchange before Brian made his last play, but here taking the 16 points and taking away the 8K-8O scoring line seemed to make sense.  This play sims best.  -EEEEG is 2.9 back.

#note Brian's word did not look familiar to me, and I didn't want to let him get away with a phony while simultaneously blocking my bingo.  Other players have told me that Brian doesn't phony much, but this was the first game against me in which he did NOT phony.  Of course, I'd like to have the turn back, but considering my word knowledge at the time, I feel like challenging was the right thing to do.

#note GOBO A12 was a much better play here.  It scores six more and has a terrific leave.  On the flipside, the S hook at 15H is good for me.  With a deficit, I like to have a volatile board.
>Bricap: ACCNNO 3G CANON.C +30 224
#note I hope that I would have found that play if I were in Brian's position.  Nice job, Cap.
>Dave: BBIJRUY B1 JIB +32 191
#note This is a really interesting moment with three clear contenders for best play: BRAY H1, BUY 2H, and the play I made.  BUY is very volatile in the short term, creating another hot spot at H1, though in the long run it may make the board harder to bingo on.  I liked my move because I still held BRAY for the next turn, and also set up BY at C2.  However, I missed one important tactical point.  I think BRAY H1 is best, because if I draw one of the five remaining E's, I can probably hit JUBE 7C on the next turn.  Sim favors BRAY, with BUY 3.1 back and JIB 5.1 back.  My dream situation after JIB is drawing AIS giving me JABIRUS B1 or BRAYS H11 on the next turn.
>Bricap: NSU H12 .UNS +36 260
>Dave: ?ABHRUY H1 BR.Y +39 230
#note My move sims second best, but BUY 2H is a whopping 8.1 points better.  My big mistake here was not paying enough attention to the tracking.  With an A already in hand, BUY is very strong.  There is are no O's and only one A remaining, so I am very likely to get the first crack at the H1 hot spot.  BUY also gives me a better bingo leave than the other options, though I could quickly run out of places where a bingo will fit.  This game is a great example of the fact that it's much harder to make optimal choices when you're drawing well.

>Dave: ?AAEHNU 10I AHA +34 264
#note One off of BAUHINIA!  My play is probably optimal, though one could make the case for the very risky AQUA.  HENNA 14F sims very well, but I don't buy it at all, though it would have worked out much better for me in the game.
>Bricap: EFILRRS 13F FL.RRIES +84 371
>Dave: ?ENNPPU 12L PUN +20 284
#note Despite my suboptimal plays, this move gives me a fighting chance.  There's only one tile remaining he could hook this with, and I've got a great chance to bingo on the next turn.
>Bricap: EKLLY O8 KELLY +61 432
#note This play pretty much kills me, though Brian was disappointed in himself for not realizing he was emptying the bag.  He could have played it a bit safer with YELK.  When you look at my rack, you can imagine how crestfallen I was that he had the Y.
