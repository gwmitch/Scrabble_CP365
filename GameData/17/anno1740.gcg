#note a pretty big mistake, says quackle, but its suggestion of VEIL at 4J confuses me. EHILV?? only hits 5 7s and 16 8s, of which few play, so maybe taking the points and running is right. 12/14

#note Frustrating because quackle blocked my triple-triple! the V would've been on the double and everything...otherwise, this looks best.

>Magrathean: AEIINOT 2I INIA +16 355
#note I've left the inference of the S into these next few sims, which was in fact the case and seems to be hard not to back up. I just completely missed YONI, which looks easily the best play to me. At least my play is reasonable, but NAOI is better in the same spot. I was under a little time pressure for good measure. 10/23

#note thank you, inference engine! with an S hooking play just about guaranteed, this surges to the top. Not even close on win percentage. The sim sans inference still has JEEP winning, but losing by a lot on the valuation. Thank you, jason and olaugh!
