>Opponent: GIINPWY 8D WINGY +32 32
>Brendan: AGPRRSS H4 GRAP. +13 13
#note Didn't consider C3 GRASPS 37 and didn't know SPRAGS. C5 GRASP 25 seems best.
>Opponent: FIIPRTY 4H .RIFTY +26 58
#note Phoney alert! I didn't really think about it. WIFTY is best.
>Brendan: IRSSTUV C3 VIRTUS +33 46
>Opponent: ACEIOPT E3 ECTOP.A +22 80
#note M2 AT(Y)PIC 32.
>Brendan: BCENOSZ J2 ZO.C +35 81
#note I did not know CABEZONS. In fact, I still don't know it; it looked new just now!
>Opponent: AEIIIOO -AIIIOO +0 80
>Brendan: BDEEENS 3M BED +26 107
#note I3 B(R)EDE 32 is tricky but findable.
>Opponent: ?AAEEES 1G ASEA +28 108
>Brendan: EEHNOOS F5 OH +28 135
#note Or HEN instead. Both have the potential for vowelitis*.
>Opponent: ?EEEILO O1 EI.E +18 126
>Brendan: EENORST 10D ESTRONE +73 208
#note Only one.
>Opponent: ?EGILOW L4 .OWELInG +62 188
#note Also the only one.
>Brendan: AAIINUX M7 XI +36 244
#note K11 AUXIN 30 leaving AI is probably better. But he is drawing a fresh 7, and the unseen blank scares me.
>Opponent: ?AFINTT 8L ..FT +21 209
>Brendan: AAIMNUU I9 U.AU +5 249
#note B4 MAUN 20 is much better.
>Opponent: ?AINQST 13C QINTArS +90 299
#note 12D ANTIQUES is worth 102, but the best play is QUINS/TOWELINGS for 72, saving AT?. Of course, that relies on one knowing TOWELINGS. (It's TOWELLING(S) too.)
>Brendan: ADDEIMN 14B MID +26 275
>Opponent: ABILNOR A11 ABOIL +37 336
#note K4 (F)OAL 39 is an option, too, but I could have been setting up an A myself.
>Brendan: ADELMNO 2M AM. +26 301
#note Missing FOAL for 39.
>Opponent: DEJNNRV N8 .END +10 346
#note Huh, all of the reasonable exchanges sim better than any play here. What does (F)END lose to? Where could I possibly bingo? I guess if I make a 30+ point play to the TWS and he draws all consonants, he could be in trouble.
>Brendan: DEEHLNO 12D HE +26 327
#note 12D HEEL 34 wins 38% of games in a long (15,000 iterations) many-ply sim, even though it empties the bag. Why is that? It's ahead of a bunch of other plays in the same spot: HE (30%), HO (27%) and HOE (25%). I really don't understand why they sim any differently than each other. How can I win this one?
>Opponent: EJKNORV G12 J.KE +15 361
#note J12 VAN leads the sim with 75% wins. That's crazy! I guess he can set up JERK, but if I hit ALEURON, he's done. JAKE gives up a couple of 8s thru the E. 7K VEX is interesting; leave one in the bag with no threat of a 7 fitting on the bottom row.
>Brendan: ADELNOU H13 .AD +24 351
#note K4 FOAL 39 is the winning move. I'm still not seeing it. Perfect play leads to a 6 point win, with a guaranteed out for a 4 point win.
>Opponent: LNORRV 7K V.. +13 374
>Brendan: ELNOU 12G .O.LE +18 369
>Opponent: LNORR 13K LORN +10 384
>Brendan: NU B6 UN +10 379
#note A close game, but I just couldn't get there. Lesson learned: always scour the board carefully for overlap plays!
>Brendan:  (R) +2 381
