>Ryan_Fischer: ADEEFRS 8D FEARED +28 28
#note after 1000 4-ply it's FA or EF.  FADER is also an option.  FEARED isn't nearly as good as I thought it would be, even though it worked out.  keep only an S for which there is no place?  no thanks.  One would think at the beginning of the game, getting your hand deep into the bag first would mean a bit more.
>David_Weiss: NOTU D8 .OUNT +16 16
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EGISTV H8 .VESTInG +86 114
#note Phony.  (E)GESTIVe is the real star play.  I was thinking of everting, devesting, or revesting.  Neither of the latter two would be played, though I did have the possibility later on.  He held for a while but let it go.
>David_Weiss: ADKN 10F KN.AD +24 40
>Ryan_Fischer: DEIIOTW E4 DOWI. +18 132
#note I saw DOWIE 7H but didn't like what it gave up, so I opted to play it for less and keep the E.  Pretty happy with it, though WI(N)DIE(S)T 11B woulda been stylish.
>David_Weiss: AGRU 4A GUAR. +18 58
>Ryan_Fischer: BEIORTX B2 EX.RB +40 172
#note The problem, if you consider it one, is the super-secret seeming lack of defense left by leaving the X next to the DLS.  It takes some work, but some decent counterplays are possible, as David will illustrate.  A simple XI G13 is fine, but closes things down.  I missed TEABOX for 46, but IR isn't great, and it opens the TLS.
>David_Weiss: CENRRSU 13F RE.NCURS +74 132
#note He thought this was phony.  Surprise, surprise.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABEIOTT C7 TAB +27 199
#note I thought the A hook here was phony.  Surprise, surprise.  (That is, I only thought AFEARD was good -- luckily it's both.)  BAN(T)IE(S) in the same place as WINDIEST from a few turns earlier sims best, briefly.  Running anything longer than a few 100 spins 4-ply on this computer is too time consuming.
>David_Weiss: HM A1 HM +25 157
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIIOTY -IIOY +0 199
#note I(D)IO(C)Y J9 is a fancy dump.  In addition, there are a lot of other plays that score and leave something like EIIT that I didn't consider.  I'm not as adverse to Is as most people, but I'd rather start with just one I (EIT) instead of two if possible.  xIIOY is like 8th on the list, though.  YO(N)I 11B is a good consideration if you can't find IDIOCY.
>David_Weiss: GIL C1 GLI. +33 190
#note Why EXURB wasn't as safe as it seems.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIOPTY A6 ATOPY +34 233
#note Nice to find a play that actually is best (despite the two-vowel leave).
>David_Weiss: HOPQ M9 QOPH. +29 219
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIIITV N8 VIE +23 256
#note Fairly happy with this.  Best score, not a horrible leave, shuts things down a bit, though there's not too much to worry about on that column anyway.  It prevents the rare but unfortunate situation later on where something like (O)W 10M can be played with the case hooks, ELN, exhausted, setting up a premium play only one of us can access.  I(N)IA 11C and VITAE 14B are other options.  First maximizes leave and sims very well.  Second maximizes score with good defense but the crummy II leave.
>David_Weiss: EZ 11K ZE. +28 247
>Ryan_Fischer: AIIOOTT -IOOT +0 256
#note F5 IOT(A) solves all my problems here.  I saw IOTA of course, but not the place.  C12 is definitely not appealing.  I took a long time here and ended up exchanging because AHI 12L and TEAR L10 weren't appealing with the leaves involved.  For best results with the exchange, keep AT, because of the number of Is left in the bag, I guess.
>David_Weiss: IIII -IIII +0 247
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIINST I7 I. +4 260
#note This is the point where A(H)I becomes a viable option, and this time I totally overlook it because of the beautiful leave dumping the I creates.  ZEP blocked the S hook.  I wanted another place or two where my bing could go down since I sensed he's close.  I(D) I7 accomplishes this nicely, I think, and it jumps to the top of the sim list at first, though I didn't run it for too long.  The other benefit is if he plays UP from the I, he has to slot a 3x3, and my rack is so good I might just hit it if he's not thinking.
>David_Weiss: ?IIORST 6H IROnIST +64 311
#note Hah, he missed a 10: (MEL)IORIsTS 2A.  To his credit, IROnIST 6G is the best "human" bingo.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEINNST 15H .ENTIANS +80 340
#note I totally blanked on the fact that the O column was now semiopen (for INANEST).  I just wanted to take out the bottom row in case another bingo could be played there.  Since I had the last S, column O wouldn't matter anymore anyway.
>David_Weiss: EJ L10 J.E. +42 353
>Ryan_Fischer: CEFILLO B10 OLEFIC +33 373
#note Really close to FOLLICLE, which I couldn't remember how to spell.  OLEFIC was a calculated phony.  If I play 6, I get to the end with 1 in the bag.  Would I really take this risk when OLEIC was fine?  True, I thought OLEFIC might be good, but it's really OLEFINIC.  OCELLI seems just horrible, but what do I know?
>David_Weiss: ADE 15A A.ED +27 380
>Ryan_Fischer: AAELLNW 5J WALE +25 398
#note I thought I found the best play in WALE, but LAW(I)NE is the champ's pick.  They both win; I guess LAWINE just maximizes spread.
>David_Weiss: MOOUY O10 YOM +25 405
>Ryan_Fischer: ALN F10 .NA.L +11 409
#note Now here's where the comedy of errors begins.  I see LAN(ES) for 10 and out.  But ooh, look, I can play a phony for 11 and lose the game!  So I do!  :D  For some reason, I convince myself KNARL* is good.  It's KNURL!
>Ryan_Fischer: ALN --  -11 398
#note Luckily for me, he can't go out, and in trying to find an out play, he's down to less than :10 on his clock.
>David_Weiss: OU F8 .U. +7 412
#note So, now I can't win by going out, and I am REALLY kicking myself.  Drawing badly, and playing badly, and now giving games away.  So how can I steal this one?  By prolonging the game of course!
>Ryan_Fischer: ALN C13 AN. +18 416
#note He's so flustered by hearing my score not accompanied by "and out" that he counts and before he can realize what's happened, he's over by :01.  Oops!
>David_Weiss: O N14 O. +4 416
>David_Weiss:  (L) +2 418
