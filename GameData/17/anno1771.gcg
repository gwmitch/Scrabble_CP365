>Stefan: EIOPPTY H8 TIPPY +32 32
#note I briefly thought about trying EPITOPY, but figured that kind of shit won't fly against Joel. 
>Joel_Wapnick: ?ADDEIN 8A DANDIEs. +83 83
#note Grrrrrr.
>Stefan: DEHORTV E5 THR.VED +56 88
#note (TIPPY)TOE is a cute possibility, but this is obviously better.
>Joel_Wapnick: AENORST 11G O.ERANTS +70 153
#note Lucky bastage.

>Joel_Wapnick: NOW G3 WON +25 178
>Stefan: AEFIOOR D10 ROOFIE +25 149
#note Tough call, but I think I like my move best in retrospect. Quackle slightly prefers 10H (P)OOF (22, AEIR) and H1 FIAR (35, EOO). FOE, FEAR, or FRAE at H1 are also possibilities. 
>Joel_Wapnick: EIMNORU N8 MON.IEUR +74 252
#note Oh, come on now. 
>Stefan: ACEEFOS 15L FO.E +33 182
#note OK, this pretty much sucks. I'm so focused on grooming a bingo rack that I'm missing the near-bingo points right in front of me for FAECES at either H1 for 61 or O4 for 59. I totally deserve to get whacked with another bingo for this.

#note Motherf%$#@r!
>Stefan: ACEELNS O4 SCALENE +96 278
#note Haha! Finally got one of my own!

#note Dang it!
>Stefan: ?ACELNV A1 VALENCe. +92 370
#note eNCLAVED or VaLANCED would be the real words in that same spot, but Joel held this only briefly. And, hey, check it out, I'm now close enough that I just might win this thing....
>Joel_Wapnick: AK 13B KA. +44 433
#note .....but he's still not making things very easy for me. 
>Stefan: AEGHIMT 15H HA +30 400
#note I miraculously pick another bingo, but MEGAHIT doesn't go anywhere. I thought about this one for a good long time. Whatever the best play is will obviously be in this spot; Quackle likes taking the extra points now with HIM (39), THEM (44), HAG (36), or several other possibilities. I'm thinking I need to bingo to win, and the N's in the C and L columns look pretty promising if I keep the GI combo on my rack. And there's still some ugly stuff in the bag, so playing off just two felt right. 
>Joel_Wapnick: BBRU 4K BURB. +18 451
>Stefan: AEGIIMT A14 .I +6 406
#note AI was not what I wanted to draw, but it's not fatal. Quackle likes AIM, TIME, GITE, or GAME at 5J, but those seem like surrenders to me. If I dump the second I, I've got bingos in two places with either the L (L6 TEGMINAL or C2 METALING) or the S (C2 STEAMING or 2H RAGTIMES), and one those U's will give me TEGUMINA at C2. That said, K4 BI is probably better than A14 LI. 
>Joel_Wapnick: OTU K4 .OUT +12 463
>Stefan: AEGILMT C2 METALI.G +78 484
#note Yes! I got my L! Holy shit, I'm actually going to win this fucker......
>Joel_Wapnick: GIOSUYZ M3 G.OSZ +50 513
#note ....or not. Sonofabitch!
