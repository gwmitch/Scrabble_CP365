>Brad_W.: ABDEEGQ H4 DEBAG +22 22
#note I noticed after that BADGE was better but for some reason I did not see it.
>David_W.: ?AAGIRS 5B GASAlI.R +66 66
>Brad_W.: EEEFOQU F2 FEE. +14 36
#note I3 FE(R)E 18 is better because it uses the same tiles for 4 more points.  FO(R)E is even better because apparently EEQU is a better leave than EOQU.

#note I thought my play was a beautiful rack cleaner.  6B OHIA 23 is even better.

#note I wanted to use the spot he just opened, but I was paranoid that whatever play I made there would open up a huge Z spot.  I decided to untriple my D's and hope he didn't hit me too hard with whatever he was planning.

#note This was the best out-in-2 I could come up with.  I was nervous because he had 15H (S)NIFTER 11 to go out and lose by 1, which would send the game to a recount (and as it turns out, he underscored one of his plays by 1 so we would have tied) but I could not find another out in 2.
>David_W.: EFINRT O11 FI.ER +27 406
#note He gladly scored some points on the triple.  He said after that he did not see SNIFTER.  In his defense, he was low on time at this point (well under a minute).
