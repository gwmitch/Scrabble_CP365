#note oi, this again? at least this time I made the right exchange.
>Carl_Johnson: EIPQRRU 8D QUIRE +48 48
#note eek! I had the pleasure of getting whomped a couple of times in phoenix by carl, so this isn't the kind of start I want him to get.
>Jesse_Day: EIORRTT E5 TRO.TIER +82 82
#note I might have laughed this one off without the studying I did before nationals.
>Carl_Johnson: EIOPRTV 7H OVERTIP +69 117
>Jesse_Day: AADFJLS 6J FA +28 110
#note hmm. My play is third, behind two others - 8M FAD for 30 and J5 FJELD for 32. I don't think I ever looked seriously at FJELD, but I decided to play FA to set up the J for next turn, and indeed, the sim reflects that that's almost always my play next turn. Argh, where did the rest of my commentary go? Anyway, FAD is much more defensive, and the S isn't really going to work on the O column with the J, so I think I agree with FAD. FJELD, meanwhile, leaves a crappy leave but gives me a tempo by getting rid of the J this turn, so I guess that's why it does so well.
>Carl_Johnson: ?AEGISU O1 AUGItES +87 204
#note This sims better than the 2x2 9-letter bingo. See if you can find it.
>Jesse_Day: ADEGJLS 5K JAG +42 152
#note I'm lucky enough that my leave after JAG might allow me a bingo next turn.
>Carl_Johnson: EEFIILS 8K LIFE +31 235
>Jesse_Day: ACDELLS L1 CALL. +20 172
#note man, what a disappointment! I missed two bingos - CEDILLAS, which I most certainly know, and CADELLES, which I've never seen before. Of the plays that remain, CALLA doesn't do too bad...SCALED is best, but I didn't like using up my big hook just to end up down 42. For the curious, my rack actually bingos through A, E, I and U...I only got as far as the one with the A.
>Carl_Johnson: ACEEINS 12B INC.EASE +72 307
#note CEDILLAS still wouldn't have blocked his bingo..
>Jesse_Day: DDEENOS J12 DOE +18 190
#note oh no! I missed another one! this one was slightly trickier, but yech. Missing two in a row when I pretty much HAVE to bingo is a shame. I liked my play among non-bingos, though, and so did quackle.
>Carl_Johnson: DINNOOX 13H OX. +37 344
#note the play was ENDORSED, incidentally.
>Jesse_Day: DEENOST 15D DENOTES +85 275
#note finally, something easy enough for me.
>Carl_Johnson: DIINNOY 1H YONI. +30 374
#note (CJ) The sim prefers YODLING 3I here, which I considered. I still like YONIC, which sims second best.
(JD) I was talking to some other people after orlando, and we commented that Carl, along with being a great player, will keep playing open even with a big lead - a la nigel. I guess this is a case of that here, although I still need a lot of help.
>Jesse_Day: AAHINOU 14B OHIA +19 294
#note The big scorer, which I completely missed, is HAULING through the L and the G - I'm not sure that I have a good reason for missing it except rust. My play is next best, but far, far worse. I'm really disappointed about playing this badly.
>Carl_Johnson: DGIMNOW 10B MOW.NG +20 394
#note Big mistake. What should I have done here? Answer on my next rack.
>Jesse_Day: AAABNPU -AABPU +0 294
#note the exchange doesn't even show up on the generate plays list, but I simply couldn't find a tolerable alternative. Interesting to note that the pool is extremely consonant heavy, which would've made a play like NAPA up top more acceptable. Quackle also likes BUNA at the top or PUB, but NAPA seems to me to be the only tolerable alternative - or AA at the bottom left, but that doesn't allow me many chances to draw the blank or S.
>Carl_Johnson: DDIKTVZ -DKTVZ +0 394
#note I was so worried about the consonant-heavy bag that I missed JARLDOM! A lot of good it did me. Quackle recommends keeping the Z here, but I don't see how it could come in handy. DIRK 6C also sims well because of what it does to the board.
>Jesse_Day: ABEHNNT N2 NAH +24 318
#note the exchange is good news, though my chances are still no more than 1%. However, my play is second-best - I completely underestimated the synergy of EHNT versus BENT, which more than makes up the difference in points. The bingo percentages aren't high either way, but keeping the H has the added bonus of allowing a nice fish at the bottom-left if I draw an A.
>Carl_Johnson: ADIRRUY 6B DUR.Y +21 415
#note (CJ) When the phony sims best and stays, you've created equity. I honestly thought it was good.
(JD) the turning point in the game...well, besides me playing like a donkey up until now. I held him on this for about a minute and let it go. I thought of DURRIE and DHURRIE, and I guess I trusted him too much. He was surprised after the game that it wasn't good.
>Jesse_Day: BEENTUV I11 V.. +13 331
#note the situation is desperate anyway, but my play isn't particularly good regardless - just trying to draw the S or the blank to hit SUBTEEN, which isn't going to win anyway. I have a tendency to go for dumb fishes even when down too far, when the right play has to be taking the points. In this case, the play is BUNTER, which is probably better anyway because it allows me more tiles to draw the blank or the S, and only allows him a two tile play to block if he doesn't want me bingoing out.
>Carl_Johnson: AAIKRTZ D3 TZA. +28 443
#note Too bad he didn't play a B on the column that bears its name.
>Jesse_Day: BEELNTU 9A NUB +19 350
#note wow! I missed YET ANOTHER BINGO - one that I know, even, BETELNUT, which I guess isn't an easy find, but my play actually has about a 10% chance of winning versus the 5% of BETELNUT! I'm not sure if that's just quackle making the wrong plays or me hitting 9s that often, but I bingo 15% of the time after NUB, supposedly. I still would've taken BETELNUT in a heartbeat if I'd seen it though. Interesting to wonder if anyone would find this over the board while seeing both plays, and whether they would just take the spread.
>Carl_Johnson: ?ABIKRW 2F BRAW +25 468
#note Apparently, the best play here is WIN A7.
>Jesse_Day: EELMPST 8A EM +25 375
#note yet another mediocre play to end the game. I was pretty low on time, and I guess I didn't see his out. Best is very tricky - see end of the game for answer. Too bad TEMPLETS doesn't quite work.
>Carl_Johnson: ?DIK B2 DIKe. +20 488
#note The only out.
>Carl_Johnson: (ELPST) +14 502
#note best for the endgame is MELD at B2, which requires him to burn the blank to block the big out, and leaves me outs anyways. In general, I played completely shamefully and should consider taking up a new game. Maybe bocce.
