>Joey_Mallick: AENORSX D8 .AREX +28 54
>Steve_Grob: DELMRST C11 MELD +27 49
#note This gets top billing by Q, but I kind of like MELDS at 6B for 32, too. I didn't see that option during the game.
>Joey_Mallick: ?ENOPSU 15A UNSPOkE +91 145
#note MENOPAUSE is safer and cooler and harder to find.  I should have at least seen SPUMONE.
>Steve_Grob: AEINRST B6 STAINER +76 125
#note I mean another N, after I bingo with the first one.
>Joey_Mallick: AAEIPST A5 PEAT +28 173
#note PIETA or APE would both be improvements.  I'd prefer PIETA for one more shot at the huge N spot.
>Steve_Grob: AABIIOT 6G BIOTA +14 139
#note Q takes out the volatile N spot with OBIA at 14G, but it's very close.
>Joey_Mallick: AEGIRST L6 STAGIER +76 249
>Steve_Grob: AAAIJLW K10 AWA +26 165
>Joey_Mallick: DFGIOOT J12 FOG +17 266
#note FAGOT (the word, that is!) needlessly opens the board.  It also makes it easier to put out the UNSPOKEN area.
>Steve_Grob: AAIJLRY I13 JAY +41 206
#note Toughest choice in the game for me. That volatile N spot at H15 has been open too long, I figure. Yet, since I'm significantly behind I should probably leave it open and play the same word at 5i for six more points. In making this choice, I was thinking of keeping the J column open for bingos. Q likes AJAR at i12, or RAJA in the same spot.
>Joey_Mallick: DIOOTVW 8L .VOW +30 296
#note This opens the board some, but I'm not too concerned about putting a W out there.
>Steve_Grob: AILNRRZ N7 Z.RIL +16 222
#note Missing AZL(O)N for 34 at N5, although that IRR leave is nasty. About an 11 point difference in equity according to the duck.
>Joey_Mallick: DEILNOT O10 TOILED +28 324
#note Finally got the N a couple turns behind schedule.
>Steve_Grob: AINNORR J8 NOR +10 232
>Joey_Mallick: EGHNNOY 5I YEH +35 359
#note Now I can't get rid of my N's, but I'm in pretty good shape.
>Steve_Grob: AIINRSU 10D .UIN +6 238
#note Best is NAIRU 4J for 19, but this one's pretty much history at this point, anyway.
>Joey_Mallick: BGNNOTU M12 TONG +17 376
#note Not sure why I didn't play TUNG instead.  I know the Q is still missing but that's hard to play, U or no U.
>Steve_Grob: ACEEIRS O6 CA. +19 257
#note Referencing my game against Stern, I see DECIARES immediately. Of course, this time there's no D hanging out there. Best is AE at N14.
>Joey_Mallick: BFMNOUV 14A MU. +20 396
>Steve_Grob: ?DEEIRS J4 R.. +3 260
#note Missed bingo wouldn't have come close to winning, but would have made the final score a bit more respectable. Darn blanks give me problems;-)
>Joey_Mallick: BDEFNOV 3J FOND +23 419
>Steve_Grob: ?DEEIQS C1 EQuIDS +33 293
#note With no time to speak of, I just slapped this down immediately. Joey believes I may have had a chance to set myself up for a play along row 1.
>Joey_Mallick: BEV 4B V.BE +18 437
#note Another drubbing is history.
