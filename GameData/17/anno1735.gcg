#note JA(W) is the other option. Safety + ugly leave versus volatility + less ugly leave = stylistic decision.
>Guy_Incognito: LNRTTVW -LNTVW +0 55
>Kelly: EIJOPST 12I JOIST +44 120
#note It might be a bit better to give up the points with JO(W), but it’s close. Taking a healthy lead and the big hotspot on the board isn’t bad, I suppose.
>Guy_Incognito: ACEEKRT 8K ..K +10 65
#note Eep.
>Kelly: ?EFIPPX 10J PE.P +14 134
#note Must be in a slump, because I’d expect to see P(R)EX-10K. My play actually doesn’t come in that far behind. The thinking was that FIX is somewhat dynamic, and there was a decent chance Guy’s bingo next turn would open up a nice spot for the X.
>Guy_Incognito: ACEERST N2 ECARTES +83 148
>Kelly: ?EFGIIX O1 EX +36 170
#note Close between this and XI-L4. The II leave isn’t too hot, and even though I’ve got ?G with it, -ING bingoes don’t look too likely on this board.

#note What’s the point of learning the UU-fives if you can’t find BUTU(T)-14I when you need it? I hated putting all my eggs in the exchange and try to bingo basket, but the exchange comes in second.

#note I was convinced it was VENAL but not VINAL. Messing up all kinds of words I’ve supposedly learned is not a good feeling. Anyway, S(OF)A, despite all its counterintuitive-ness, comes out on top of the win percentages at a fighting 25 percent chance. Proof of a faulty win percentage calculator? You decide.
