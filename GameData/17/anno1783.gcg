>Dave: IJMQRRR -JMQRR +0 0
#note Probably not the best exchange.  Static evaluation prefers keeping MR.  It's a bit surprising to me that that does better than keeping IMR.  In retrospect, I prefer keeping IMR or just R.  Not sure what I was thinking here.
>Robin: IISTZ 8D ZITIS +48 48
>Dave: EIILRRT H8 .RI +3 3
#note Now the two letters I kept on the exchange are what hurt me most.  It's amazing that I can't score decently at all here.  I think I probably shoulda played LIRI at E5 or 7G.  SIR instead of SRI increases the odds that my bingos will fit, but it also gives a lot more to her on row 11.
>Robin: IQ G10 QI +22 70
>Dave: EEILRRT F6 RE. +5 8
#note She blocked my bingo and once again I can't score.  However, this time I think I actually made the right move.  The TRET hook is useful.
>Robin: EEFJ 5D JEFE +35 105
#note Hmm... after three turns, she's played the Z, Q, and J for a 97 point lead.  Never fear, bingos are here!
>Dave: EILNORT 4G RETINOL +68 76
>Robin: OSTV H1 VOT.S +39 144
>Dave: AILNOST 12A LATINOS +78 154
>Robin: EIV A12 .IVE +21 165
>Dave: AAAHNWY 5K AWAY +31 185
#note With AH in hand, I liked this way of playing, giving me a chance for row 3 overlaps.
>Robin: EMU 11C EMU +20 185
>Dave: ABDGHNN 3L BANG +28 213
#note The H is much more versatile than the B.  I think it's worth the three point sacrifice to keep it.  There are several good places to score with it on this board, including HAJ...
>Robin: ?ACEGLN 15A .LEGANCy +86 271
>Dave: DEHMNPS 13C HM +33 246
#note ... and this spot.
>Robin: ACDEEU 3C EDUCA.E +31 302
#note Very nice play by Robin.
>Dave: DENOPSY O1 PO.Y +42 288
#note After suffering through the first three turns, I've had very good timing with a lot of the middle value letters, but I'm still down on a board where comebacks won't be too easy.
>Robin: GHI 2B GHI +22 324
>Dave: DENORSX 7F .X +34 322
>Robin: AFT 1A FAT +27 351
#note Robin told me after the game that she needed another V for VATFUL in this spot.  That woulda been sweet.
>Dave: DENOORS 6C NO +11 333
#note Wasn't sure what to do here.  I liked this just to grab what points I could off the J and set up the ONO hook for possible bingoage, though it would have to be a perfect fit.  A move I missed that I like is NODI J1.
>Robin: BDEEL 6K BLEED +35 386
#note An awesome move by Robin that puts me in serious trouble...
>Dave: ADEORST 9D AD +17 350
#note ...especially after I miss my bingo.
>Robin: OPU B4 UPO +12 398
#note Robin really wanted to play off four tiles, to stop me from being able to fish one without emptying the bag, but she said her rack was so poor that she couldn't find a way to do it.  Stop here, and figure out what you would do if you were in my position.
>Dave: AEOORST 9H .E +3 353
#note I think my move is the right idea, but not quite the right execution.  The natural play of OY H14 doesn't work so well, because there aren't that many bingos that I can draw which will fit on the board, especially if I fail to find ROADSTER again.  On the other hand, fishing the E gives me five chances for N/R/U/? for RATOONS/DONATORS, ORATORS, or OUTSOAR.  However, it would have been better to drop the E at K7, so that ORATORS would have fit in two places.  It also would have avoided the block she has that fortunately for me doesn't quite work.
>Robin: ?DIRRUW 9H ..WIReD +10 408
#note A valiant attempt.  At least she forced me to find the slightly more difficult bingo.
>Dave: ANOORST N8 O.ORANTS +72 425
#note Robin was understandably NOT happy that K was the last letter in the bag.
>Dave:  (KRU) +14 439
