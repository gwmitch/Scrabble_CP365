>Cesar: AEEINOT 8G TOEA +8 8
#note I'd clearly choose an exchange. I'm wary about just playing OE, but it's either of those, definitely not TOEA! [-6]
>Opp: EIT 9I TIE +9 9
>Cesar: EINNPQW 7F QI +15 23
#note just barely below exch NQW or INPQW.  [-0.5] 7F NEW sims better too. i'd exchange!
>Opp: ADEEIRT L4 AIRTED +21 30
>Cesar: AEMNNPW K3 WAME +30 53
#note i remember being surprised by her move. M2 PAWN is a little better. [-2]
>Opp: ADF 10H FAD +22 52
>Cesar: LMNNPSV -LMNNPV +0 53
#note didn't see J6 PLAID but exchanging sims just below.. [-1.5]
>Opp: DELV M2 VELD +25 77
>Cesar: AIIIRST 6G AIRI.. +11 64
#note i was probably annoyed at this draw but this sims best.
>Opp: HK H4 KH. +15 92
>Cesar: IPRSTUZ N5 SPRITZ +50 114
>Opp: HNOY 4E HON.Y +15 107
>Cesar: ALMPSUV 5C VUM +30 144
#note i missed AMPULS again this time but VAMP for 40 is clearly better than VUM.. i don't even have the O (although there are a lot unseen and i probably noticed that). [-4]
>Opp: GLNOOO B2 OOLONG +27 134
>Cesar: ALNPSSW A7 AWLS +24 168
#note AWLS seems reasonable to me at the moment. 3A WOPS wins by a little bit. [-2]
>Opp: BEIJ 11E JIBE +31 165
>Cesar: ?DENOPS 12B SPoONED +96 264
#note 12B uNPOSED and this are basically tied at the top. gotta take it, right.
>Opp: AEGINST 13H SEATING +76 241
>Cesar: BENTUUU 12J TUBE +26 290
#note thought i better just outscore and not open anything else. i know lanes are open but they aren't terribly flexible. A1 UNBE which i didn't see sims much better.. i believe mainly because it kills a lane. (and the 4 extra points don't hurt) [-8]  
>Opp: FXY 3A F.XY +34 275
#note two open lanes still
>Cesar: AAGNRUU 2D AUGUR +15 305
#note the tile pool is beautiful -- what is more likely, a bingo beginning in a b m or O, or something that hits the P JUST right? i thought i was blocking the right lane. saw lots of stuff like orceins.  AUGUR DOES sim best surprisingly, with a 75% win chance at many plies, and then there's the odd PUNG C12. 
>Opp: ?CEEIOR C8 RECO.IEd +74 349
