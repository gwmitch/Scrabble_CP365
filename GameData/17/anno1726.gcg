>Kelly: AEGIMOR 8G GO +6 6
#note I never know whether to fish or score with opening racks like this. I discarded IMAGO/AMIGO because I hate in-between plays that sort of score and sort of fish, but CP likes it over GO or MOIRA.
>Randolph_Mantooth: DIKNOTU I6 KUDO +16 16
>Kelly: ADEIMRW J9 WAIRED +21 27
#note Couldn’t find a fish that I liked, but CP advocates (O)W-H8. I still wonder how easy it would be to get the bingo down next turn.
>Randolph_Mantooth: ABINSST G2 BASTIN.S +64 80
>Kelly: ELLMNOR H1 MOL +21 48
#note Now it wants me to go for turnover with MERLON(S), M(E)RLON-13I, or (A)LMONER-3G. I dislike the L, but is ELNR not worth sacrificing a few points?
>Randolph_Mantooth: EEEIJNT 5E JE.E +22 102
>Kelly: ?ELNRRT K8 RENT +20 68
#note Missing the supercool LaTER(BO)RN, along with REL(E)aRNT and TRuN(D)LER.
>Randolph_Mantooth: EEGINOT I2 OE +12 114
>Kelly: ?EILOPR L2 PROLInE +71 139
>Randolph_Mantooth: AEGINTT 12C GNATTIE. +70 184
>Kelly: ACHIRUX 6F X. +50 189
#note X(E)RIC-13I scores 13 more.
>Randolph_Mantooth: ?ADEHIU D6 DAUpHI.E +62 246
>Kelly: ACHIQRU M8 CHARQUI +105 294
#note One of my best finds ever. I should be in good shape now, right?
>Randolph_Mantooth: ABILRSZ N2 BRAZILS +96 342
#note Bugger.
>Kelly: AAFIITT C4 FIAT +14 308
#note Trading a decent lane for a bad one. TAFIA-C2 looks better.
>Randolph_Mantooth: AENNOSV D1 VENA +32 374
>Kelly: ADEIOPT H12 .OTA +12 320
#note CP hates this one. I was so obsessed with opening things more that I didn’t even look for something like PIETA-O1. Did you know CHARQUI takes a D as well as an S? PODIA-15K gets me within shouting distance, and with the bag so consonant-heavy, maybe I could pull it out with some good fortune.
>Randolph_Mantooth: EGNNOSV O1 VOES +33 407
>Kelly: DEEIMPR B6 PE +25 345
#note Now that I’ve got a hook for ETA, time to try PE and hope Mantooth can’t block it.
>Randolph_Mantooth: FGNNUWY A7 FUNNY +40 447
>Kelly: DEIMORY 1B RI.E +7 352
#note Couldn’t resist getting cute. That D hook is still useful: IDEM-15L is the play.
