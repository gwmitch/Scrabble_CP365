>Alan_Stern: CEHT H6 ETCH +18 18
#note I arrived late to my first game, and it was pretty uneventful.
>Ryan_Fischer: ACEIKOU 6D ACKE. +21 21
#note Nope, should be AUK/KETCH.  I got this confused with KENCH which I knew was good, and HENCH*, a phony Chris Cree once tried on Trey Wright.  It's all downhill from here, too.  But don't worry; it gets better.
>Alan_Stern: AFGN 5H FANG +29 47
>Ryan_Fischer: EIIMOUU D4 MI.OU +16 37
#note best by a mile.  IO(N)IUM, the only other consideration, isn't worth considering.
>Alan_Stern: ADGO L3 GOAD +21 68
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEIRUV -  +0 37
#note Lost challenge; confused it with VANG, which I always want to hook an A to, but know not to.  Oops.
>Alan_Stern: ?DEEIST J4 I.SErTED +62 130
#note This uglifies the board quite nicely.  Too bad for me.
>Ryan_Fischer: EEEIRUV 8A REV.E +24 61
#note Eh.  Should be (r)EVERE.  IU sucks without a E, Q, O, N, M, or S, but I need the points.
>Alan_Stern: APZ C3 ZAP +36 166
>Ryan_Fischer: EILRRUU 8J .ULIER +18 79
#note Quackle says GURU 3L, which is cute if you're suicidal.  I'm down 100, so it might not hurt to take a risk.
>Alan_Stern: FI 9L IF +20 186
>Ryan_Fischer: ALOPRUV G9 OVULAR +17 96
#note It's cute, but I didn't know the Y hook, which I would pick up later.  VULVAR C8, which I oddly didn't know either, is best.
>Alan_Stern: AJRS 12D JAR.S +26 212
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EEPTUY 11J .EPUTY +24 120
#note No 7s or 8s, and I'm fading fast.  He's probably close, too, and IF really hurt me.  I missed YEP 15G 37. 
>Alan_Stern: QT E11 Q.T +24 236
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ABEEIN O10 B.E +9 129
#note I really was at a loss as to what to do here.  So I tried to create a hook and hope for the best.  (J)IBE D12 is Quackle's choice, and it doesn't look too bad.
>Alan_Stern: OW B6 WO. +14 250
>Ryan_Fischer: ?ADEINO A8 .EOrDAIN +80 209
#note Finally a break.  Best.
>Alan_Stern: AEINOSS 14F E.ASIONS +62 312
#note And that's all she wrote.
>Ryan_Fischer: BDELMRT H12 .L.B +20 229
#note It's funny, I saw that, hm, if he didn't play IF earlier, I'd have TREMBL(E)D.  It didn't once cross my mind to play it without the D, but Quackle likes it.  I don't see how I can win after that, though.  After about 300 iterations, it gives me a .5% chance of winning.  Ah, THERE'S where I left my white towel.
>Alan_Stern: OXY 15M OXY +41 353
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEMRTW K10 M.W +12 241
#note Desperate fish that sims okay, though I missed it for 2 more pts in the same spot.  MIAOW 4I is actually brilliant, but I don't know if it'd hit anything ('cause of course he'll block).  M(E)AD(O)W K10 is another option.
>Alan_Stern: IN 12K .IN +22 375
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEORTT 4I T. +4 245
#note The Champ sees nothing to help me, and finds A(C)R(E)D, which I play next turn after fishing off the T.  Alan at least seemed to like the creativity of the play.
>Alan_Stern: GIN 6L .ING +8 383
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEIORT E5 A.R.D +28 273
>Alan_Stern: HLNR 7H .H.N +13 396
>Ryan_Fischer: EIOT M2 TOE +14 287
#note Even under time pressure, TOE is best.
>Alan_Stern: LR L11 ..R. +6 402
>Ryan_Fischer: I I14 .I +6 293
#note And out.  That was how not to play Scrabble.  Next up: How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.  And by bomb I mean 98-point out-bingo for the win.
