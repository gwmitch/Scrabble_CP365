>Brendan_Sullivan: ?CDOSSU J6 COS +27 39
#note ESCUDOS plays at J2 and J9. Didn't know it.
>biza0re: AADEHSY J6 ...EY +20 39
#note 9H ANY 17 leaves the more balanced ADEHS
>Brendan_Sullivan: ?BDESTU 11D BUDgETS +79 118
#note Surprisingly, this 18 point miss was not my DUmBEST move this game.
>biza0re: AADEHIS 12C AAH +25 64
>Brendan_Sullivan: AFGIQUW 10B QUA +37 155
#note 13A QUAG 38 is better.
>biza0re: DEEINRS G3 DESER.IN. +66 130
#note Very nice! The only bingo, actually.
>Brendan_Sullivan: FGINOTW F4 NOW +31 186
#note Missing the juicy overlap F2 GONIF 41.
>biza0re: AENOOUY A8 YEA +31 161
>Brendan_Sullivan: FGILOTV E5 GOLF +30 216
#note Right letters, wrong anagram. H1 FLOG 39 is better.
>biza0re: CDENOOU H11 .DUCE +30 191
>Brendan_Sullivan: AAIRTTV 14D VATI. +12 228
#note Not really sure what I was thinking about here. Sure, VATIC doesn't give any opportunities back to my opponent, but it doesn't particularly do much for me, either. Looking back, my first thought is that 13A VAT 16 is probably best. A 2-ply sim (6000 iterations) says that B5 VITA 14, 3G (D)AVIT 13, and VAT are all about the same, with B4 VITTA 15 and B6 VIA 19 both one point behind. My play is 7 points back.
>biza0re: EGLMNOO 3B MOONE. +25 216
#note GLOOMED in the same spot is 4 more.
>Brendan_Sullivan: ADINORT 4A DARN +24 252
#note VATIC:  pertaining to a prophet. VATICINATE: to prophesy (anagram = INACTIVATE). VATICINATOR: one who prophesies. It would have been a sweet move, and it competes with the potentially fruitful fish 2B OD 17. If I'm going to play 4 tiles in that spot, I might as well take NODI; ART is much better than IOT, especially with 6 Is in the virtual bag.
>biza0re: GHILRTW 13G H.G +22 238
#note CRWTH plays at 6J for 21. 7I (JO)W 13 is interesting; there's a roughly 1/4 shot of hitting A/E/? to bingo there, hooking JOWL.
>Brendan_Sullivan: GILORST 13A LOG +14 266
#note This gives up easy 30+ point plays to the TWS. B2 I(MA)GO is a little safer. Or, 7I (JO)G 11 sets up the S.
>biza0re: ILPRTWZ 15G P.W +16 254
>Brendan_Sullivan: AIIRRST D7 AI +11 277
#note A bad move. I think I was worried about getting vowel heavy, given the contents of the virtual bag, but if I'm making a short play, RIF or MAIR are much better, undoubling the R. (Huh, UNDOUBLE is good, indeed, but it means "to unfold." Weird.) If I want points now, B1 TA(MA)RI 20 works, but opening the 3x3 seems overly risky.
>biza0re: AIILRTZ 2A ZA +32 286
#note B3 (MA)TZA 36 scores a little more, but this does set up his L hook, I guess.
>Brendan_Sullivan: FILRRST A12 F.IT +33 310
#note Play FLIR instead.
>biza0re: ?IILRTX 7I ..LT +11 297
#note After 4F (NE)XT 19, any of the following 2-tile draws give him a bingo that plays at B1: BE, EM, EN, ER, ES, EK, KM, EL, LM ET, MT, NT, EP, NO. (This analysis has been brought to you by the letter Z as in ZYZYZVA!) Playing it at 9I allows for 8s thru the T, as well.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EILRRST M3 TRIES +25 335
#note Yes, I have a pretty good bingo rack, but I have to assume that he does, too, after JOLT; plus, he must have the blank (he probably wouldn't play JOLT with neither S nor ?). I didn't really consider the GAMA/LAMA/MAMA hook possibilities; I was more concernced with 7s and 8s on columns L and M. I'll need to run a really long many-ply sim on this one, but I did a short one (4000 iterations) just for now. My play only wins about 65% of the time, whereas fishing off one or both Rs wins about 72% of the time! 8C RIF and 6D ROWER are best. I'm very likely to hit a bingo hooking JOLTS or LAMA myself. And if he bingoes in one spot, I might be able to play in the other spot anyway. My play of TRIES essentially renounces my chances for bingoing and says, "let's start trying to wrap this game up." However, from this pool, it looks like it's much better to take one's chances drawing 1 or 2 to EILRST or EILST than drawing 5 to LR.
>biza0re: ?EIIORX L4 OX +31 328
#note Ooh, missing L7 TRIOXIDE 80.
>Brendan_Sullivan: EKLMNOR 1B MONK +19 354
#note Well at least I didn't draw all of those Is left! I don't have many ways to block the T bingos on column L. YOM and TONER/TRONE jump out, but they score so little he might not need a bingo to win. 5K O(XI)ME 28 is my best scoring play, but gives up bingos to many racks. Again, I'll need to run a super-long many-ply sim to get some good answers, but after 6000 iterations, Quackle says TONER wins  76%, and 1B MOKE and OXIME win 72%. I never considered TONER/TRONE. And the main problem with MONK is that . . .
>biza0re: ?EEIIRR 1B ....ERIEs +42 370
#note . . . it gives up this play! A nice find. However, L7 TIRRIVEE 66 seals the victory!
>Brendan_Sullivan: EIILPRT N1 PLIE +17 371
#note Oy! I think I had 90 seconds or so to find TRIPLITE for the win. This was my dumbest move of the game. PLIE seems to yield the closest loss of the non-bingo plays.
>biza0re: BEIR L7 .RIBE +8 378
#note Well, we both missed some bingos down the stretch, but there's nothing worse than having one winning bingo and just not seeing it. Especially if your opponent saw it!
>biza0re:  (IRT) +6 384
