#player2 Gallant Gallant
>Goofus: CGMOORX 8D CROOM +24 24
#note Sims better at 8H, but I had the X in hand and was also wary of all the extensions, CROOMING/CROOMERS/CROOMPIT#.
>Gallant: AAEHIII -AAIII +0 0
#note 7G HAI simmed about as well as exchanging here.
>Goofus: AEFGHUX E7 F.UGH +24 48
#note Figured it was okay to wait to cash the X, and FRUGH doesn't take an S, so better defense.
>Gallant: EEEGHIS 10D E.GIE +11 11
#note GEESH/CROOMS scores 13 more, but the better leave is worth passing up the points for, I think.
>Goofus: ADEFITX G8 .X.FIED +27 75
#note Grrr, thought I missed something here. Stupid TAXIFED.
>Gallant: AEHKOST 13E TO.SHAKE +69 80
#note Gulp. Hated to leave the DRS hooks, but can't pass up the bingo here.
>Goofus: ACEGORT M8 GOATER +48 123
#note GORT in the same spot, maybe. This is okay.
>Gallant: IIINPQY 12D QI +36 116
#note At first I didn't see this interior play; glad I looked a little longer.
>Goofus: ABCDNNS 7G BAND +39 162
#note Beat him to the hook!
>Gallant: IIINPRY K3 NIRPY +31 147
#note Missed 11I RIPI(T)Y, ugh. 9 fewer points but IN >>> II. At least the K is already gone so I don't have to worry about KNIRPY coming back.
>Goofus: CINPSUZ 12L P.Z +36 198
#note Easy choice here.
>Gallant: IILMOTW 14G .OILIT +31 178
#note I'm kinda proud of this one; it's the sort of play a lot of intermediates would miss. Note we have (hae?) both FRUGHIT and DOILIT down (doun?) - love those -IT past tenses!
>Goofus: CEIINSU 5D CUISINE. +70 268
#note Glad he didn't block this...
>Gallant: ADMOTUW H1 DOWM. +42 220
>Gallant: ADMOTUW --  -42 178
#note DOWMY, DOWMIE, but not DOWMI*. DOPS! I always mix those up.
>Goofus: ANNRRTW C9 NWA +18 286
#note J4 W(I)NTRA would be better if I were behind.
>Gallant: ADMOTUW 8M .OW +21 199
#note Trying to open up something...wish I could get an E so I could use the C-column hook.
>Goofus: AJNRRTT N7 J.RT +19 305
#note Leave and defense make this an easy choice.
>Gallant: AADMTUY 3F ADUMA.TY +88 287
#note Back in business. Goofus didn't even say "nice find, Gallant". What a dick.
>Goofus: AEILNRT 2B RAINLET +77 382
#note Yeah, great play, except I forgot the stupid hook.
>Gallant: ?BENRSU A1 UBNERpS +87 374
#note What's funny is that Goofus challenged only the hook. UBNERPS* isn't even good in Collins.
>Goofus: ADEESVV -  +0 382
#note Yeah, yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, whatever
>Gallant: ?AELLOO J9 LOAL.. +8 382
#note I know he's almost surely got either V(A)EVE/ECUISINER or B11 VEVE, so I'm thinking I need to set up a big scoring potential outplay...
>Goofus: ADEEEVV C1 V.EVE +33 415
#note Shocked he didn't block this, but I figured I'd have VEVE and ADE/VEVED or ATED/IE/ECUISINERD to go out if he didn't.
>Gallant: ?EOS K10 EnO..S +38 420
#note Whew! Glad I had the last two O's and the blank!
>Gallant:  (ADE) +8 428
