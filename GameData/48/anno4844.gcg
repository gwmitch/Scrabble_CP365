>E._Tran: DHNOOQS 8G HOOD +16 16
#note I'm greedy for S's.  Sim prefers HOODS, or exchanging.  8F might be better, too, to set up QIS.
>Allan: EMN 9G MEN +24 24
>E._Tran: AILNQSS K6 QIS +21 37
>Allan: EKU J8 .UKE +25 49

>E._Tran: AELNRSV --  -94 37
#note Close your eyes here.  I saw and know ENSLAVER, be decide to play ENRAVELS in a moment of stupidity.
>Allan: EJR 11I J.ER +22 71
>E._Tran: AELNRSV 12K LEV +18 55
#note Star play is VERSAL M8.  Strangely LEVA sims better than LEV.  Very Weird
>Allan: AALN N12 ALAN +15 86
>E._Tran: AENNORS O14 NO +14 69
#note VAN is supposed to be better.  looks a little dangerous to me.

>Allan: DGI L5 GID +19 124
>E._Tran: IIOPRTT H12 I.TI +15 149
#note Maybe TORI/ROTI 7F.  Those sneaky parallel plays are hard to find.  
>Allan: EIV E10 VIE. +20 144

>Allan: BIO M3 BIO +13 157
>E._Tran: ANOPRTU 12A POUT.R +28 206
#note PATRON or PANTO N2 sim slightly higher.  More sneaky parallel plays.
>Allan: DEIPY A10 YI.PED +42 199
>E._Tran: AILNRTX N4 TAX +32 238
#note Sime thinks TAXI is very close behind.  Again, very confusing.
>Allan: ?CELS O4 SLiCE +38 237
#note This has me scared.
>E._Tran: BILNORS C10 BR.IN +14 252
#note My strategy now is to clog the board and make his 2nd blank less effective.  NOIL B11 is better at achieving this.
>Allan: MOW 7F MOW +24 261
>E._Tran: CDLNORS 9L COLD +16 268
#note Again, COD 9M is close.  I don't understand why these 3 consonant and 4 consonants racks are simming so well.  The does the V-C ratio make that big of a difference?
>Allan: GTU 15D GUT +13 274
#note Allan told me after he didn't draw the 2nd blank until after this play.  *facepalm
>E._Tran: GNRRSTY M8 G.R +4 272
#note And somehow I still get stuck with all the consonants. great.  GYM is better, somehow yielding a Win% higher than 50%.
