#note this isn't too much worse, but i'm very annoyed that i missed ZOIC. (-1)

#note who saw the play? you get a star. geez. (-15)

#note FEU is stronger, at M3 (-2). i wouldn't have thought so.
>maddy: OOX M3 OXO +31 67
>cesar: DEEOPTT K1 PETTO +30 111
#note N3 PETTO sims best. apparently my play and N1 TOPED are just too open? it doesn't make too much sense to me, honestly. i almost played TOPED, which sims a point and a half better. (-3)
>maddy: BILORSU 2E BLOUSI.R +64 131
#note i suppose that's one reason why this play sucks
>cesar: ADERRWY 1K .ARRY +36 147
#note i still have not made a top play. i just blanked on PARDY. (-5)

#note 12D WOE is the top simming play. 0 for 6. (-8)

>cesar: ?EEGHIU 12G HUE +14 265
#note the beautiful 12C AGUE sims better than anything else. i suck. HUGE is better than my play too. (-10)

>maddy: JY 15M J.Y +39 362
>cesar: BFLLMOV D9 FL.M +26 365
#note FLAB is obviously better than my play, what am i thinking? but it likes BALM best, i think FLOV is more versatile here and scores more the next turn than BLOV.  14J for example. (-1)
