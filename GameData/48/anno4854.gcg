>Will: AIOPRST 8D AIRPOST +70 70
#note Hello. This is the first game I have ever posted to x-t. To start things off with a valuable pearl of insight, I have no idea what the merits of different placements of AIRPOST are. This one sims well.
>Brad: ACRSZ K4 CZARS +42 42
>Will: AEHSWXY 4K .HEWY +40 110
#note F6 HYRAX looks okay. An additional wrinkle of this game is that I need to win by 107 to win the tournament.
>Brad: CFIO 9B COIF +17 59
>Will: ?AAOSTX 6H TAX. +27 137
#note 5K ZAX.
>Brad: BIQSU 10E SQUIB +42 101
>Will: ?AMNOST B2 MONASTi. +76 213
#note Saw N2 TOWNSMAN but felt comebacks would be too simple, sim agrees.
>Brad: DELLNOR M4 .NROLLED +61 162
>Will: AEJNOTU A1 JOTA +45 258
#note Wavered between JOTA and JUTE...the E situation probably gives JUTE the edge.
>Brad: MOP O1 MOP. +33 195
>Will: EEEINUY C3 EYE +26 284
>Brad: DEFOR 2J FORED. +36 231
>Will: EEINTUU 8M .EU +9 293
#note Not horrible but not great, I did see several row 1 plays, but didn't like the vowel-only leaves. I felt I needed to bingo at least once more to get to a ~100 pt margin.
>Brad: IILR 1G LIRI +17 248
>Will: AEINNTU F10 .UIN +13 306
#note Gamble time.
>Brad: AEI 11K AI.E +10 258
>Will: AEGLNTU 13B UNTA.GLE +74 380
#note Was pissy about LANGUET not playing for a short while before spotting this.
>Brad: BGI H12 G.IB +27 285
>Will: ADEHKRV O11 DRAVE +37 417
#note Unfortunate miss of N10 HEAVED for 55...but as things turned out, it wouldn't have gotten me to the 110 point margin I needed.
>Brad: ?ADEENV 15C VENDA.lE +64 349
#note Curses!
>Will: GHKNOTW 14J HOWK +35 452

#note Good spot by Brad, a deserving winner.
