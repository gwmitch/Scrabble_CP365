#note Rafi didn't like ZIP, because of how a lot can go wrong.

#note Debated between this and HER. A tough choice, I thought.

#note Hm. I didn't notice the D hook for a while, lol...

#note This is best, but can you find the only other bingo? (Besides THALlIUM, of course) Rafi: What no D?????
>RafiJOOOOStern: AILNNPW 8L W.AP +39 307
>Whatnoloan: AAABFIO 14J BAA +24 362
#note Noah: Finally noticed that D(JIN) was there!!! Thinking about OAF or OF, but I played this to save OF for next turn, trying to block.
>RafiJOOOOStern: GIILNNO D10 .OLING +25 332
#note Rafi: Where are the Ds????
>Whatnoloan: AAEFIOU G2 OF +27 389
#note This was tough. I thought about D plays, but this leaves plenty of good scoring D plays, plus left an F/S hook to the triple. Also, the leave isn't that great. Playing FAU(N)AE looks better here. 
>RafiJOOOOStern: EEFINRT H1 REF +37 369
#note Quackle likes REFIT a little better, but this keeps a nicer leave and the hook. 
>Whatnoloan: AAEIOUV 6K VA.UA +12 401
#note Not sure why I played this. Something like VOI(C)E looks better, scoring more. 
>RafiJOOOOStern: DDEINRT 1A TRINED +36 405
#note Rafi: Didn't know RINDED, wasn't sure of DINTED.
>Whatnoloan: EEIMOOR K2 REMO.E +22 423
#note Quackle likes ROOMIE a little better. Dunno.
>RafiJOOOOStern: DEEITUW 15A WED.IE +33 438
#note Quackle likes W(R)ITE, maybe because of the overlaps on WEDGIE and plays to the E. Hm. Tricky. This is almost as good according to Quackle.
>Whatnoloan: DIOORST 14B DO.OR +31 454
#note Best.
