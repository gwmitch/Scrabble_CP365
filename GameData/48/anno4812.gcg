>Joey: ?DEENRT 8F TRENdED +68 68
#note I know what Kenji would have made the blank.  (private joke)
>Adam: ABIIJNV K5 JIV. +28 28
>Joey: AAINORU F2 RAINOU. +11 79
#note There was absolutely nothing that stood out here.  DOURA L8 is probably a smidge better.
>Adam: AAABIIN 5D BA.IAN +16 44
>Joey: AEFGNTU H1 FANG. +33 112
>Adam: AEIMOSS I7 A.EMOSIS +63 107
>Joey: AEERTTU H10 UTE +13 125
#note TUTEE and TATER are the only fives that reach the triple.  Surprisingly, TATER isn't even on Quackle's radar, while TUTEE is the only better play than UTE.

#note ARDENCUP* didn't fit, not that I would have tried it.

>Joey: EEORTVX D4 O.VERT +24 347
#note I had a number of X plays to choose from, but I preferred going for an I for the 15G placement.
>Adam: ?FIIKLW 2M FIL +23 343
>Joey: EEIOXYZ 15G XI +42 389
#note This should do it for sure.
>Adam: ?DIKLOW C2 LOW +17 360
#note Nice setup, but there is a better play, which salvages a tie!  Explanation on the next move while you think it over at home.
>Joey: EEHLOYZ N8 ZEE +37 426
#note I knew this would win by 1, but I didn't want to mess around with something like HEY B1, because it would allow KHADI!  YEH allows no such comeback.  Adam's game tying move is WILD C1, which forces me to block with LEZ.
