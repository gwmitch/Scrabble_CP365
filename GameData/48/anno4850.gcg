#note FIG obviously better.

>Frank: DEEJQVV E5 DE.VE +18 66
#note You can see what I'm trying to do. Four shots to draw an A for JAG; four shots to draw a T for QAT. But K5 VENA wins the sim. It sets up the J for JEE without the element of chance.
>Matthew: DLPSSSX M7 P.X +30 132
>Frank: BGGJLQR -BGGJLQR +0 66
#note Not best. It's just so easy to trade 7, but so rarely correct. Keeping JR wins likely because of the hot spot.
>Matthew: ADHLSSS O6 AD.S +22 154
>Frank: FMORTUY 10J FURY +34 100
#note FUMY. Brutal.

#note HOLK felt so wrong. And it still feels wrong. Too defensive-minded here?
>Matthew: BEILNSS 11G BINES +23 246

#note No reason to blow up this rack for a mediocre score. OOT.

#note I have a bad feeling about next turn.

>Frank: DIILUUW -DIILUUW +0 193
#note Again with the trade 7. Probably wrong again. There isn't much for me to be digging for, so leaves of IL and ID are keepable.

>Frank: GNNPQRY -GNPQY +0 193
#note Bunch of trades sim close here. A lot of them seem to give up on bingoing.
