>Jason: ?DEHIIM 8G HIM +16 16
#note Feared I was missing a bingo. Wasn't. This and MEDII are in a dead heat.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: FGO 9H FOG +18 18
#note "Two-point win, let's call it a game," Jeff joked.
>Jason: ?BDEIIN J9 .IB +8 24
#note BE(FOG) is cute.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ACW F6 CAW +26 44
>Jason: ?DEEINR 11E RENDI.lE +90 114
#note INtER(B)ED sims better, but I wasn't sure if it took an -S or not. I decided to maybe sacrifice equity now to avoid headaches later. (-3)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: BE 10F BE +22 66
>Jason: ?AEGQSU 12B SQUEG +38 152
#note Whiffed on QUAGS, K5, which scores the same. (-7)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EINRU C10 RE.UIN +30 96
>Jason: ?AADEIO 14B O.DIA +16 168
#note Right tiles, wrong spot. DA(N)IO. (-5)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ALNOZ 15F AZLON +44 140
#note Rightly whacked for the mistake. (I seem to be typing that a lot recently...)
>Jason: ?AEFORT L8 FOR.dATE +80 248

>Jason: DOPSTVW M7 V.W +26 274
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IJ 15A JI. +32 205
>Jason: DNOPSST 13I DOP.S +20 294
#note I almost tried to block the E with a play like (K)NOPS ... Jeff had all seven tiles together on his rack and wasn't shuffling, which told me he had a bingo ready. But this sims best.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEEGLRV O1 LEVERAG. +89 294
#note At least I read the tell correctly. grrr...
>Jason: EHNNSTU 5J HUNTE. +18 312
#note I don't know if there's enough vowels left to play NU(K)E. And I don't like NU(K)ES. They sim well ahead, though ... surprised this is as high as third. Didn't like this play. (-8)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AMT 6H TAM +24 318
>Jason: DELNPRS N4 R.P +23 335
#note Duck prefers D(E)N. (-2)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: IIINSTT M3 TI. +9 327
#note (Jeff's exact rack.)
>Jason: DELNOSY 4I YON +16 351
#note Looking at the pool, and with no great scoring plays (missed SYNDE(T)) I decided to block -ION bingos while trying to give myself "bingo back" potential. SYNDE(T) is CP's pick. (-1)
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIINST D4 ISATINE +68 395
#note A little unlucky that Jeff drew AE, but he deserved it after his hellish Saturday. I really can't say enough about how well he played both of our games, esp. this one. 1-6, I'm up 108 on him because of two blank-bingos. He admitted afterward that it looked bleak, but never whined, never quit, just kept plugging along. Good on him.
>Jason: DELLRSY 4C R.LLS +5 356
#note Close. DR(I)LLS or DR(I)LL are four better.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ACOOTUX 8A TAX. +33 428
#note Missing (E)AUX, two better.
>Jason: DEY 15L .YED +24 380
#note Not often you lose 30 pts. of equity, draw both blanks, and lose by 36. Again, props to Jeff.
>Jason:  (COOU) +12 392
