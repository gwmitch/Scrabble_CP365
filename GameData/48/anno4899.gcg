>Goofus: IIILRUU -IIILUU +0 0
#note Thought about ULI or URI, but those plays make me sad.
>Gallant: ?EEEFIO 8F FEO +12 12
#note Ugly play, but whaddaya gonna do.
>Goofus: ACOOORT F6 OA.ROOT +14 14
#note Don't know why I didn't just play FOO. Maybe I'm overvaluing turnover.
>Gallant: ?EEGILN 11E G.NELIEr +82 94
#note Cake.
>Goofus: ACDIOTU H10 D.UTIC +30 44
#note What is it with me missing five-vowel eights lately! Duh, AUTECOID...
>Gallant: ADEHOSW L4 WASHDOE. +82 176
#note Second best; COWSHADE I'd forgotten about. (Why isn't COWHEADS* good? Cows have heads.)
>Goofus: ?ADIORU 15H .URIADOr +83 127
#note Was thinking there was an -IC bingo with this rack and looked for one a long time, but nope, there isn't one. Then I saw this, wasn't sure of it but put it down right away. Gallant didn't even hold, of course. (It's good.)
>Gallant: EHNRSTY 8L .YHN +33 209
#note An old proto-Gaelic word meaning "dusty", "musty", "fusty", or "homosexual and damn proud of it, thank you", depending on who's saying it and in which position in the sentence it appears.
>Goofus: AABEEEN K5 BEA +25 152
#note Maybe ABE, to allow bingos on row 3? Thought about NEBE 14L but didn't like the two A's in the leave.
>Gallant: EFIMRST O1 FIRSTME. +92 301
#note Hi Diane!
>Goofus: AEENNSV 7H NEV.. +14 166
#note Desperation setting in. Getting bagged again. The tile gods are visiting the sins of my father upon me. Damn you, Daddy, sir, for fishing excessively and not giving enough thought to board control.
>Gallant: AIILLTV 5D VILI +25 326
#note Glad to take that hook away...
>Goofus: AEENSTU H1 TUNEA +26 192
#note Shit, whatever, time to cut spread. Pretty racks don't help now.
>Gallant: AALLNRT D3 LA.AL +16 342
#note Despite the play's unassailable Quebeckitude, this is wrong - why open the board and not keep a vowel? Even some play like LA(I)T 14F blocks a lane and milks a few points. Dumb.
>Goofus: EGMPQSS 2F SQ.EMP +27 219
#note So far behind. I'm just throwing tiles on the board now. Fortunately for me, this happened to fall in the right spots on my second attempt. (My first attempt missed the board entirely, and knocked over a neighboring player's stuffed bunny or some shit. She was fat. I would have apologized, but what's my name again?)
>Gallant: INRRRTT -RRT +0 342
#note Quackle prefers TINTR(O) N10 16. I admit that's probably correct, even leaving RR.
>Goofus: EGGIJSU 1A JUGGIE +53 272
#note A rack like that and neither bingo plays. Goshdamnit. (JUGGIES, JIGGUES)
>Gallant: CDIKNRT N11 DICK. +24 366
#note This was the equity play, but I should have listened to my instincts and blocked.
>Goofus: EPRSTWX 5K ..WP. +12 284
#note Got down under a minute; tempted to take (R)X/(E)X 9G 34, but I figured I could type those parentheses fast enough next turn. BAWPT preserves more flexibility, though I'm so far behind that maybe I should have taken the points. Hmm.
>Gallant: BENRRTZ J10 B.RN +12 378
#note Again, overthinking this and overmanaging my rack. NEB(I)T 14E leaves one in the bag; he might have TRYXO or TRYXI 15A, but those wouldn't be enough to win. Someday I shall learn, alas.
>Goofus: EORSTXY 9F .X +34 318
#note Two in the bag and a 34-point one-tile fish...speaking of fish, yeah, my opp, ya think?
>Gallant: AEIORTZ 12A ZAIRO. +53 431
#note Go up by 113, that's kneel formation there - no way is there anything from the J. What's he going to try, JANETORS*? Don't make me guffaw...or so I thought. Fiddlefaddle!
>Goofus: AEORSTY A1 .OEYRATS +116 434
#note Australia in yer grille, woohoo! Seems Gallant forgot that Australian rats have babies too. I'm so going to the strip club after this one.
>Goofus:  (ENT) +6 440
