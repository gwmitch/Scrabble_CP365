>Sue_Beard: IJNOT 8D JOINT +40 40
>Jim_Burlant: CINORTW 9C COW +25 25
#note Knew conjoin and conjoins (i.e., the verb) but didn't know CONJOINT.
>Sue_Beard: ANUV H4 VAUN. +12 52
>Jim_Burlant: AIINRRT 3G RAI +14 39
#note I recalled this opponent tending to close things down, so I figured it would be a good idea to fork the board up top.
>Sue_Beard: FLO F7 F.LO +18 70
>Jim_Burlant: IKLNRTX J3 LINK +22 61
#note Saw the dangers of the potential C/P hooks and wondered to myself, how likely is it that she's really going to have one of those?
>Sue_Beard: EEPRT 2J PETER +43 113
>Jim_Burlant: ?DENRTX M2 .XTENDeR +86 147
#note I had to chuckle when Susan had put down PETER - how probable was it that she would have the P?  Fortunately, this gave me a very nice opening for my bingo.
>Sue_Beard: ABU 8L B.AU +24 137
>Jim_Burlant: ADEEFIR L8 .ARFED +26 173
#note First real miss of the game.   Quackle prefers DEAF K4.
>Sue_Beard: OOW K9 WOO +30 167
>Jim_Burlant: AAEGINR 2A ANERGIA +72 245
#note Was concerned about the placement but figured that as long as she didn't have the Z, I'd be all right.
>Sue_Beard: DEZ 1A ZED +77 244
>Jim_Burlant: ?EIMOOT 13E MOTIOnE. +62 307
#note Sheesh - the second time she has the right thing at the right time.  Almost missed this bingo in favor of MOO 1F
>Sue_Beard: GSV H12 V.GS +36 280
>Jim_Burlant: CDEEINT 14B CITED +35 342
#note Whoops, only saw ENTICED and 8's (INFECTED, INDECENT) that wouldn't play.  Turns out this wasn't  a bad miss - my play blocked a very big play she was going to hit me with.
>Sue_Beard: BUY 1G BUY +29 309
>Jim_Burlant: AEELNOS B9 SOLE +16 358
#note Aaaagh!  Where has my brain gone?  Saw the 8 GASOLENE but completely whiffed on ENOLASE.
>Sue_Beard: AHP A10 HAP +25 334
>Jim_Burlant: AEEGHNQ O7 Q.AG +14 372
#note Felt it urgent to start blocking bingo lines.
>Sue_Beard: AEIISTY L4 AY +19 353
>Jim_Burlant: EEHINST 12D HET +21 393
#note And I almost blow the game here.  I just didn't see the obvious QUAGMIRES extension  
>Sue_Beard: EIIMRSU O7 ....MIRES +66 419
>Jim_Burlant: EINS 10D EL.IN +21 414
#note Neither of us had noticed that the case L went undrawn, which changed the final score.  We only realized this after we had already turned the signed result slip in and we were putting the tiles back into the 4 corners that a tile was missing, which we found in the bag.  Replaying the end-game I  win this game by a  much greater margin than what happened here.  The final score of this game was recorded as 426 - 425, my favor.
