#note Talk about luck! Without that I, my rack is worthless.
>Mike_B: EOSW G6 WO.SE +20 38
>Carl: ANOTUWY 7C YAW +29 89
#note I still don't seem to grasp that OUT isn't as useful as AUT. YOW F10 sims better by 6 points. 
>Mike_B: FIT F10 FIT +27 65
>Carl: ENNOPTU H10 UNOPEN +33 122
#note Chickening out on UNPENT. I thought I was confusing it with UNRENT and UNKENT. As it happens, UNBENT and UNSENT are also good.
>Mike_B: HIT 9C HIT +32 97
>Carl: DLNNOTV 14E VOL.D +11 133
#note VOLTI wins the short game, but I bet VOLED does better in the long run. A 14/15A bingo after VOLTI would cripple me.
>Mike_B: AIV J6 VI.A +16 113

>Carl: GGMORTU 12C GRO. +12 208
#note TRUG M12 wins the sim, but the way I see it, if he bingos at B9, I'm up the creek. *That* creek. As it panned out, he *did* have a bingo there.
>Mike_B: ELT M11 TEL +19 188
>Carl: CFGMRTU -FGMU +0 208
#note TEL is a scary play. ZA N10 would give him the lead and set up an exclusive lane. 
>Mike_B: AAEELRS 15G A.EALERS +64 252
>Mike_B: AAEELRS --  -64 188
>Carl: CDIIRRT 15F RI. +7 215
#note Even when I tell Quackle that he has an S on his rack, it thinks I should play IRID N5 or CIRRI N3. 
>Mike_B: AAEELRS F4 ERA +12 200
>Carl: ACDDIRT 4E R.ADDICT +78 293
#note Life is good.
>Mike_B: EGL H1 GEL. +18 218
>Carl: BDEELRU 2F BL.ED +18 311
#note Again, I ask: Why do I sim my games if I'm going to disagree with Quackle so often? Sure, I see BLUER 5B, but BLEED takes out the bingo lanes. In fact, I strongly considered BLEEDER in attempts to get to the blanks. But look at the pool. BLEEDER is just about certain to give Mike something big at K1.

#note Championship player doesn't think column O is a threat, and advises me to take the points with FRIVOLED 14B.
>Mike_B: ?SZ N10 ZaS +45 285
>Carl: ABEEFIM 5B FIBE. +24 361
#note FAB 6B is better by 6 points.
