>Carol_Ravichandran: HIRT 8F THIR +14 14
>Jason: DJKNNNO H6 DJ.N +12 12
#note Maybe a touch of FPS; wanted to set up the -N hook for next turn since it was unlikely she had one. Duck likes J(I)NK instead. (-3)
>Carol_Ravichandran: GNU 10F GUN +21 35
>Jason: EEHKNNO 6C HONKE. +24 36
#note "Do you love Jesus?" she asked. Usually our games are filled with puns, but that's the only one I can remember from this one.
>Carol_Ravichandran: AORS 11H SOAR +22 57
>Jason: EGNORTV 5B VETO +25 61
#note Missed GR(O)OVE. (-2)
>Carol_Ravichandran: EMOU 10J MOUE +24 81
>Jason: AFGNPRT 12I FRAP +31 92
>Carol_Ravichandran: IQS J6 QIS +40 121
#note Whoa, THIR doesn't take an S. I hate fives.
>Jason: BGILNOT 13K LIB +18 110
#note Missed the row K plays like GOBLIN. Must study hooks to phony fives ... GLINT, making THIRST, is cool. All I remember thinking here is "dammit, if I'd played VOTE instead of VETO, I could bingo!" (-12)
>Carol_Ravichandran: AO F8 .O.A +5 126
>Jason: AAEGNOT E11 AGO +12 122
#note Sims best.
>Carol_Ravichandran: ILT K5 LIT +19 145
>Jason: AEMNPST K9 M.... +7 129
#note Going against my rule of "only fish into a stem if you know the anamonic and have studied all its bingoes." I saw NEPATS took all vowels, L, R, T, D; 33 of 48 hits, by my count with hooks galore. AMP wins sim, but that's too gutsy for me, given Carol's last two plays. (-5)
>Carol_Ravichandran: ABCEL 4I CABLE +24 169
>Carol_Ravichandran: ABCEL --  -24 145
>Jason: AENPSTV 4J PAVE +22 151
#note As Berofsky once said: "Nice draw, moron." Considered throwing the V back, but knowing five of her seven tiles told me an NST leave, drawing four, was pretty good here. Sim likes VENA, 14J. (-8)
>Carol_Ravichandran: ABCEL D11 BAL +23 168
>Jason: EFNSTTY 13D ..FTY +12 163
#note I don't like this fish. I should've taken the points: TESTY at N2 is good, FE(LO)NY at 13B works. The "hooks galore" I had before are gone. and I can't count on her giving me spots (although on this board, it's hard to make a play that doesn't). (-13)
>Carol_Ravichandran: EGZ M3 G.EZ +28 196
>Jason: CEEENST 14B SCENE +36 199
#note Right idea, wrong spot. CETES, 14J. Spaced on the MORAL hook. Maybe CEE, 14L, setting up both -S hooks? Could be disaster if I miss the fish, though. (-14)
>Carol_Ravichandran: CEIR 15F RICE +24 220
>Jason: EELNTUY J2 YU. +16 215
#note Stupid MORAL hook. YEN, 14J. (-7)
>Carol_Ravichandran: DUW 4E WUD +13 233
>Jason: EEILNRT 2C ENTIREL. +63 278
#note A bingo! Break out the party favors, this tournament has officially started for me! Why LIENTERY, Duck? Four-tile X play at 1A, even blank-assisted, scores at least 74. (-1)
>Carol_Ravichandran: AWX 3A WAX +44 277
>Jason: ?AEEIOT N6 AE +17 295
#note Damn, too early to play ETAErIO(S)#. I thought this play was pretty slick. Now I'm almost guaranteed to bingo out, and even if Carol takes the good spot and leaves me the lame spot, the 18-point lead should be enough to make up the difference. Naturally, it doesn't show up on CP's radar. I still like it. (-23)
>Carol_Ravichandran: ?ADIINR O7 RAIDINg +76 353
#note Turns out she can't bingo to the S, so maybe OE at 1H would've been the spread play. Oh well.
>Jason: ?EIOOST B7 ISOTOnE. +59 354
#note I always like it when a plan comes together. Ugly game, but it did the job.
>Jason:  (D) +4 358
