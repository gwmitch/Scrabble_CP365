#note Shrug. Everything else I could think of sucked.
>Rob_Robinsky: ACGGJRR -GGJR +0 0
#note Trading here is a really cool idea. I never would have thought of it.
>Evans_Clinchy: CEFHOQU 9G OF +16 30

>Evans_Clinchy: CEEHQRU 12H QU.CHE +60 90
>Rob_Robinsky: AAEELNU H11 E.UAL +42 113
#note AQUAE is a little better.
>Evans_Clinchy: EGKOORV M8 EVOK.R +34 124
>Rob_Robinsky: AADDEIN L4 NAIAD +21 134
#note Or DEAD 8L? Or AIDED in the same spot, which keeps a slightly worse leave but scores a couple points more.
>Evans_Clinchy: EGMORSV M3 VEG +19 143
#note The sim likes this. It keeps a decent leave and scores a reasonable amount without opening anything too ridiculous for Rob.
>Rob_Robinsky: ?ADENPU 10A PUdENDA +70 204
#note PUDENDAL along the bottom scores 13 more.
>Evans_Clinchy: BGMORSW K3 WOMB +41 184
>Rob_Robinsky: AEEEIRU A8 RU.EE +24 228
#note PEREIA dumps an extra vowel.
>Evans_Clinchy: AGIIRST E5 AIRTI.G +32 216
#note I strongly considered just playing IS at N11 -- that QUICHES hook is a huge scoring spot, and I thought about taking it out and keeping AGIRT, which is a great leave with the N sitting there in the 2x2 lane. But if he takes that lane out, then AGIRT suddenly becomes kinda crappy. Didn't feel like taking the risk, so I took the guaranteed 32 keeping an S.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEIIRTT F5 IT +10 238
>Evans_Clinchy: ADFLLSY 8L ..FY +33 249
#note Not taking the QUICHES spot now is a clear mistake. FAS is the best play.
>Rob_Robinsky: AEILORT C3 TAILORE. +68 306
>Evans_Clinchy: ADLLMSS N10 MAS +48 297
#note Okay, so I figured it out a turn late. Better late than never.
>Rob_Robinsky: GIINOTT D2 GIT +14 320
#note Rob notes that "Quackle seems suicidal" here -- TOIT D1 keeps ING, but it opens a triple that I'm going to cash in, and then he's left with nothing. His play looks fine.
>Evans_Clinchy: DLLNSSY 14M SYN +26 323
#note SLY un-doubles the L's, of course, but I didn't want to expose the Y to the TWS. This play seems safer. Close call, though.
>Rob_Robinsky: INORTXZ 14F ZO. +32 352
>Evans_Clinchy: ?DLLSTW 10I D.W +7 330
#note Ummm... I have no idea. LLST? seemed like the best leave I could hope for here, and NOTHING scores points. Maybe LLST? turns into an -LY bingo down column O? I can hope...
>Rob_Robinsky: DIJNRTX O4 DIRT. +11 363
#note ...and Rob wisely blocks the lane. This or RINDY does the trick.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EHLLST K10 .E.HT +37 367
#note Doesn't look like I'm gonna bingo. I guess I'll just pray that this is enough...
>Rob_Robinsky: AJNNNOX 3I JA. +21 384
#note It's not. Rob makes an awesome play here, scoring with his J and guaranteeing the win. This is the only win with perfect endgame play (not that perfect endgame play is a given -- we're both low on time).
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EEILLS 13A SELL +16 383
#note I can't win the game, but I wish I'd played AHORSE 13J. Style points GALORE.
>Rob_Robinsky: NNNOX B4 OX +21 405
#note GOX 2D is a little better, but both plays win.
>Evans_Clinchy: ?EI I3 .IvE +10 393
#note Missing BIZE and SIZE through the Z at the bottom, a two-point mistake. I believe I have about four seconds on my clock. In any event, great game!
>Evans_Clinchy:  (NNN) +6 399
