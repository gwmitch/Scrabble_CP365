#note I asked Rik to send me his racks a few days after the tourney - turns out he doesn't record them. The part that follows is his effort to piece his racks together - decent but incomplete. I made assumptions on the tiles he changed.

#note I'm going to start by saying that my moves in this game generally lacked strategical depth as they seemed relatively clear to me when I was playing the game. I did think that some of Joel Sherman's moves in his 803-scoring game (available at http://www.cross-tables.com/annotated.php?u=9979) were rather well-thought out, though I may not necessarily agree with all of his points. This may be because of the TWL-Collins dictionary divide which sometimes demands a different approach to the game. I'm stopping short of saying that either is necessarily more strategical approach since I lack experience with TWL.

#note I generally consider myself overly defensive, since picking the closed option to protect my lead has sometimes cost me games. This was generally the reason why I picked this positioning over the other one at C6 - I thought there was a good chance of him playing across the horizontal TWS (hitting the DLS) and with a bad pickup I could still score well and get rid of stuff around the vowel openings or the R opening. This was especially the case if he was going to hit me with a 3x3 - his play suggested a scoring Q-dump with a relatively confident leave (perhaps containing the blank). I wasn't too concerned about opening another 3x3 line, and thought I would need to be rather unlucky if I picked up crap while he played one through the R. Many players may disagree with my choice.

#note This was equity-wise a mistake and I made it because I wasn't 100% sure of FAKIER and FAKIE+ (the latter has just made it into CSW12). I didn't want to lose a turn and give him his opportunity for a 3x3, which he seemed to have been fishing for. This was especially the case under free challenge. Funny I thought that way on this move though, since did I phony twice in the tourney with less favourable circumstances.

#note All bingos opened up the triple lane. (D)ACE is probably the best non-bingo option but I believed my lead after this play would be unassailable (unless he was holding BEEITUX, perhaps).  This is where the blowout really started...

#note Another possible mistake here but at this stage I was just playing for the points, not knowing or caring that this game could potentially be a record holder. DONG in the same spot keeps a more flexible CLY and can go better with the remaining tiles - pretty balanced vowel/ consonant-wise but lots of Is in the bag which work well with the leave.

#note I was just going for score at this point - no point sacrificing major score for slightly better (and even so, not that great) leaves. FL(O)G 9E was probably a better play, giving myself an opportunity at CHIVE next go. I was just sad that he'd just blocked my spot for F(E)LCH+.

#note There are a few options which score well and keep a fairly balanced leave - however in the realm of spreads and records I think my play is the best.

#note Rik would have blocked my outplay if he were tracking correctly - like in Joel Sherman's record game Rik just took out the bingo line which seemed most probable. If he did block the outplay with his best move, I would have scored 802 - just one off Joel Sherman's record (which, FYI, also included an unblocked bingo at the end).
