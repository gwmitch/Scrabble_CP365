#note tough call between taking the points for timeout and playing this. I need spread but timeout is a bit of a gamble.

#note avgas or vigas both beat my play, CV is not a great combo to retain. my bingo percentage is lower with ACISV than with AC.

#note I would much rather play something like voices than avo or ova here. the win percentage seems to bear me out although it loses a few points on valuation.

if I'm really concerned about spread I guess I could play avo but there sure seems to be some good stuff out

#note I misplayed this powerful rack. cashing in xyst is not worth it although it's the safest play. sacrificing 3 points to play PYX at 12G does better than my play because it leaves the B up top as a lane. in the end I'll take pyrex - it still leaves the big lanes open and scores ok.
