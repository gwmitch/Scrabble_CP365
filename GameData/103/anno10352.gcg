#note Plenty of good options here; DUPE, DEPUTE, DUPE(S), (L)ETUP and UPEND(S) are all worth considering. LETUP gives a difficult hook to block, but he could block it if he has a T. Also, bingos with LETUPS give pretty good comebacks, usually. I like DEPUTE and DUPE better than LETUP. DUPE(S) opens up the top right quadrant, but I think UPENDS is a more sensible way of doing that. DUPE keeps a good leave and also keeps open the S bingo lane, and opens a D. On the other hand, it closes sevens lanes. DEPUTE is also reasonable, but neither play opens lanes that are hard to block. I think I like UPENDS here.

#note I don't love closing the sevens lane, but there's not much else to do here.

>Noah: EEHMNTT C9 THE.T +24 123
#note It seems like HEFT is better here, since the lanes it opens are stronger than THE(F)T's.

#note Ugh...I wanted to open a tough lane to block even though I knew I was exchanging next turn. Should I just exchange now? He isn't necessarily going to block column L, so maybe that's right instead. BDJV is disgusting.

#note I thought about RAJA or JAR. Ed is likely to have the blank given his past plays, and even without implication he's pretty likely to have one of AAA?, so no JAR. I just want to try to hit something on column F with this.
