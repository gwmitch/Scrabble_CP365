#note I did not come up with grosz as a play here, but with no great S hooks it seems like a nice way to score and open the board some more. it's weird how many Es are left.

#note this play is bad news
>jd: AAAISWY M12 AWAY +24 279
#note I started trying to fastplay him after he took a very long time to play luv, so this went down right away. WAW or WAY actually seems better because I tend to score well with the remaining tiles next turn.
