#note not 100% sure on the first two racks.
>jd: EINOPTY 9F .OY +18 48
#note tantalizing rack, eyepoint and linotype are the only 8s though (no neotypic*). this is the point in which I got started on a bad groove that ended up not working out. the rather defensive tophi at G5 sims best, followed by entity. this doesn't bingo enough next turn.

#note his rack is dugies?!
>jd: EFINPTT H12 P.NT +27 96
#note fine rocks this sim. PINT doesn't end up getting me that many extra points next turn.

#note I almost challenged this

#note conrad's doing a nice job of shaping this board to his will
>jd: AADEHNT N9 AH +34 157
#note it's not looking good one way or the other. I discarded HOED pretty early but it offers some advantages I didn't consider - it opens two separate lanes, to the D and hooking to SHOED. in spite of the AANT leave I wish I had played hoed.
>Conrad_BB: ASZ O7 ZAS +41 234
#note he really struggled with this decision. wonder what his last 4 were?                                                   cbb: considered OILS, AIOLIS, and ZAS. OILS clearly looks to be the best play. At the time I think I felt that this wasn't a board that keeping a Z would succeed on, so I figured I'd take the 14 points now. Despite the awkward leave, there are a lot of one point tiles left, so for every time I draw IO to this, there will be another time I draw some nice one pointers to bingo through the T down south, or the G up north. My play is about 4 back - understandable.
>jd: AADDENT 8K AD. +6 163
#note I had to make a move like this when HOED last turn would've left a lot more lanes open. I didn't want to play DAD because I didn't want to block the G.
>Conrad_BB: IKLT 7H KILT +21 255
#note cbb: Quackle's top choices involve playing in row N. If you know my playing style at all, you know I'd never do that. I'm reasonably certain that Jesse knows WISHA does not take an S, so I don't mind "blocking" the potential hook, but I think
>jd: ADEEINT J2 DETAI. +13 176
#note I didn't like having to blow through so many tiles, but I didn't like the way my leave combined with the T. I could play EL at J6 but I rarely hit anything next turn. any play that doesn't create a lane allows him to block row 15. hence, my choice.
>Conrad_BB: IJOW N6 JO +39 294
#note cbb: I just don't remember this rack or the next one, but they were both super-obvious plays, in my opinion.
>jd: ?EILNOR 15H .ERpINOL +74 250
#note bingoing so as to create new lanes would be a nice idea, but I couldn't figure out how to do it and I need points anyway. OUTLINER is probably the closest thing - but even if I bingo again I may not be caught up. still, is outliner a better try than terpinol? I'm not sure.
>Conrad_BB: BGIW 3I B.WIG +28 322
>jd: AEEMNNR 2F MENA. +18 268
#note unsurprisingly he blocked both of my bingos. I am in trouble here. my choice gives back too much - I like NEATEN.
>Conrad_BB: CIORRTU 1E TORIC +40 362
#note cbb: URIC is better.
>jd: EELNNNR 5I N.N +6 274
#note game over, cut spread and play TEN at 4J
>Conrad_BB: AEMORRU L1 MO.RA +24 386
>jd: EEFLLNR E11 FL. +24 298
#note merl to block the tws sims a lot bette and keeps flu for next turn
>Conrad_BB: EEORUUV 1L .OVE +27 413
#note cbb: mistracked, no time left, just wanted to score enough just incase he had something through the V.
>jd: DEELNOR 14L LODE +22 320
#note surprisingly this is best
>Conrad_BB: BERUU 9C B. +14 427
>jd: ENR O1 .RNE +5 325
#note long story short, conrad outmaneuvered me this game. he controlled the board expertly and I missed a couple of chances (hoed, outliner, menad) to steer the course of the game more.
