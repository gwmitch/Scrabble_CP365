>Ryan_Fischer: DFINOPS L1 FIND +30 81
#note This is where I screw up big time.  The automatic play here is FOND.  I played FIND, because of the abundance of Is, but If I'd've kept my I, I'd've bingoed with something I knew instead of missing something I didn't.  :)
>Daniel_Milton: DEEJKR 13G JERKED +39 127
>Ryan_Fischer: DEOPRRS H12 P.ER +27 108
#note Yeah, see, I don't know DORPERS.  I'd know SPIDERS or REPRISED!  I played this, setting up an S hook he may not know, and taking the hotspot.
>Daniel_Milton: IIII -IIII +0 127
>Ryan_Fischer: DDMORSU M2 DUD +22 130
#note I really didn't like taking this spot, but didn't have much of a choice.
>Daniel_Milton: ABLZ 5D BLAZ. +32 159
>Ryan_Fischer: CMORSTY D2 COR.Y +24 154
#note 6D YOM 33 is pretty obvious now.  I thought I was clever setting up my M for a bingo, and I heard him mumble something about the X when he made this play.  I should know better than to listen to anything my opponent says during a game. :)
>Daniel_Milton: AY 6D .AY +32 191
>Ryan_Fischer: AHIMSTX M10 H.X +27 181
#note Forgot MASTIX, though it's not the best play.  10K H(O)AX 37 looks okay, though I thought this would bingo faster.

>Ryan_Fischer: AIIMSTU --  -33 181
#note 15F TI(R)AMISU 61.  Figured I was missing something.  Don't know why I thought I could get a phony by him.  Oops.
>Daniel_Milton: HO 14F HO. +23 232
#note Yet another hook!
>Ryan_Fischer: AIIMSTU J8 .UI +5 186
#note I'm probably placing too much value on a bingo, but down 50, I figured I didn't have much of a choice.  15F AT(R)IUM 23 looks okay.  AUTISM for 34 breaks things up too much.
>Daniel_Milton: EGU 15G G.UE +16 248
>Ryan_Fischer: AIMRSTT N8 SIM +32 218
#note One turn I'm fishing, the next I'm scoring.  Of course this draw frustrated me, but I really should have committed to one course of action.  Three esses left, so I'm banking on drawing one and the blank.  ARTT isn't going too far on this board.  :/
>Daniel_Milton: EIORSST 11B SORTIES +71 319
#note Sigh.
>Ryan_Fischer: AIMRTTT -MTTI +0 218
#note Not funny.  Of note: TRIT(O)MA or T(O)MTIT.
>Daniel_Milton: ?ABINPT B4 BePAINT. +69 388
#note Serves me right.  :]
>Ryan_Fischer: AILOORT A1 TOLAR +24 242
#note Where's my farolito lothario?  My toroidal idolator?  Or something.  At least I got a hold on this.  Not a very good play, not terrible, just me giving up.
