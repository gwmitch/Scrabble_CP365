#note this is another seriously odd play. I have no idea what I was thinking. just playing BI and taking the points must surely be better. it doesn't even appear in the top 50 static choices although it 'only' sims 10 points off BI.

#note I could also just play PAY or DAY. I like that pay sets up scoring plays for me. PAY appears to sim best.
