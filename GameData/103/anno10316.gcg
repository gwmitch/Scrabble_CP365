#note Given this start and my prior two games, I was not in the best of moods at this point.

#note Marlon regretted not playing MONTE(I)tH. VIZ(O)R wasn't a bad plan B, though.
>Marlon_Hill: BBO 8A BOB +29 231
>Jason: ADGNOTU 10F AG +23 151
#note UDO, 7C. Noticed that spot was a nice place to dump the U, too. This would work out, though.
>Marlon_Hill: EFIINRR 11C FIRE +20 251
#note Marlon pointed out after the game that my "stupid AG play" blocked REFIRING.
>Jason: DENOOTU L9 DUOTONE +75 226
#note Not to mention my own bingo after a lucky draw.

#note This sims better, but I probably would've played PYKNIC if I'd seen it.

>Jason: AEKNQSY A12 .YKE +36 288
#note Missed row 13 plays like SYKE.

#note As Marlon put it, I threw the hail mary too early. After the game he showed Edley the position and how this was 100% the wrong thing to do, regardless of leave. Sure enough, the play Marlon and Edley suggested as an alternative, LO at N1, is CP's pick.
>Marlon_Hill: AENU O1 U.NAE +18 366
#note But if I put Marlon on all singles and no bingo (the former a decent assumption given his previous play/the pool; the latter I have to assume because if it's not true I'm going to lose anyway), and this is the best he can do with it ... I think my play is defensible.
>Jason: AGNORRS N7 GARRONS +71 394
#note And maybe AWOL wasn't right, but the bag liked it.
>Marlon_Hill: HO O7 OH +33 399
>Jason: AELTUUX 14D LUXATE +33 427
#note TUX at 7B wins 7/8, this 6/8. I actually thought Marlon could play SIDES or TIDES underneath this and was calculating if I could survive it, until I realized it made TE#. Marlon said he thought TIDES fit for a second, too. We got a good laugh out of that. Damn Collins.
>Marlon_Hill: DEILSST 1G DELIST +27 426
#note Very proud of this win. And while he disagreed with AWOL (and he's probably right), Marlon was very gracious after the game and after the tournament.
