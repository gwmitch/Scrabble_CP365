#note kind of a weird play in that none of the options leave me with a 'good' leave since heavy goes nowhere. of these tiles the best synergy seems to be between the K and the Y, and playing HAVE at 7H wins the sim in spite of setting up a lot of plays. I thought that playing defensively would be best because heather is rated around the 1500s and a defensive board might be to my advantage.

#note KVAS and VAS both sim very close. I like VAS myself. I saw KVAS but I think I would've played VAS had I seen it.

#note after that last play I really need to open up some volatility.

#note her last play is a little worrisome with the blank unseen, but what else can I do?

#note that was really not a great draw. she had some stuff that would fit here but she didn't need to find it.
