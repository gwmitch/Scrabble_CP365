#note Ugh. Wasn't sure of ADJURER. That's the fish. I'm going to go ahead and miss that hook several turns in a row now.

#note 12A FRIGES. Didn't really know that one. Also 13C FARING. I need to be more sure of the words. This fish is okay though.

#note I was low on time and played the first out-in-two I could find. This LOSES. She has 9G HUN which beats me by a point. Holy crap, I'm so glad I didn't lose like that. But still, count this as a blown endgame for me. I've been catching a lot of breaks like this lately.
