>Ryan_Fischer: ?AILLYY 8G LILY +14 14
#note DAYLILY.  In a DAYLY manner.  :P  Dammit.  Q static likes YAY leaving ILL? best.  Meh.  Damned if you do or don't with Ls or Ys.  Why don't I know ALL THE WORDS yet?
>Matthew_Bernardina: AEGKMTT 7H KAME +27 27
#note I'd be tempted to play TAME here.  GTT is just disgusting.  Or maybe TAKE?  This is static's choice, though.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?AOSSTY L4 OuTSAYS +81 95
#note Underscored by 1.  Only.
>Matthew_Bernardina: EGOORTT 10E GROTTOE. +63 90
>Ryan_Fischer: EMNNORT 8L .MEN +18 113
#note 4E NONMETR(O) 63.  Why don't I know ALL THE WORDS?  :(  K9 MENO 19.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACNSTUV M1 VAUNT +19 109
#note E10 (G)UV 14?  Fishy.
>Ryan_Fischer: BNOORRT 2J BOR.N +26 139
>Ryan_Fischer: BNOORRT --  -26 113
#note 2H ROBOR(A)NT 82.  And here I thought I blew the game late on.  Two missed bingos.  Wow.  At least I didn't try BORAT*. :P
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACDDHIS 11I ADD +21 130
#note MATT: CADDISH is actually a word!  I don't think it played at the time, but wasn't going to try it when I thought I was confusing it with CADDIS. 
>Ryan_Fischer: BNOORRT K2 ROTO +15 128
#note Still ROBORANT.  Or BROO.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEHISU 1M .AU +18 148
#note Or U(V)EA.  MATT: Was hoping for the other H for HUISACHE, a word I recently learned.
>Ryan_Fischer: ABGNORW 12D BARONG +24 152
#note Q static says J1 BOW 19.  Mine is a splendiferous way to break up this rack.  I'm just not playing very well, and I don't know what drawing 6 to W will accomplish.  Of note: K9 B(ED)GOWN 21, WA(G)GON for 22.
>Matthew_Bernardina: CEFHIPS 13C FEH +27 175
#note FP to the wonderful CEHIS was such a buzzkill#, I'm sure.  That's best.
>Ryan_Fischer: DILOUWX 13G XU +36 188
#note Of course I should see 2H UXO(R)I(A)L 36.
>Matthew_Bernardina: CEFIPSS 12K SEIF +18 193
#note Static says 2I FE(R)I(A)S 26.  Not too bright, really.  MATT: SEIF seemed the best of a bad lot here, trying to balance and score at the same time without giving back huge comebacks was difficult.  Knowing I had the case S and was setting it up if I couldn't hit a bingo helped.
>Ryan_Fischer: DEILORW 2D LOWRIDE. +72 260
#note Well, I finally did something right.  If I don't see this, it's WI(F)ED.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEIPSW 1H PEW +44 237
#note PEW > PAW here, yep.
>Ryan_Fischer: GHIIIOV 3B GHI +16 276
#note And if there weren't another place I blew the game, it'd be here.  Ugly, ugly post-bingo draw, and I chicken out on HIVING.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEEISZ N6 ZE. +32 269
#note O12 SIZE 51 is so tempting.  This worked out.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?IIIQUV 11M QI +27 303
#note B1 VI(G) 14 leaving the somewhat potent IIQU? is tempting.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACEIPRS 14H SCRAPIE +79 348
#note Held on this for a long time because I don't know words, and I didn't even think to look for SPACIER.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?EIINUV -IVU +0 303
#note I'm pretty lost here.  Low on time.  A game I thought was mine suddenly shifted.  I exchange, because I can't see a viable play that doesn't give back too much.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABDJNNT D1 B..ND +22 370
#note This blocked EPICENE.  MATT: Ditch 3 consonants while shutting down most of the worrisome lanes?  All while putting time pressure on and scoring 22?  Yes please.  The J can wait for later.
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEEEIN C13 .E +5 308
#note 5A EvI(D)ENCE 70; EPICENE plays elsewhere as an airball, which is why it didn't dawn on me to play it.  I think I need to score and leave one in the bag to have a chance of catching him.  Terrible play here.
>Matthew_Bernardina: AJNOTUV 15A JOT +36 406
>Ryan_Fischer: ?CEEINR C5 EIRENiC +63 371
#note I've PLAYED EN(D)ERmIC under lots less pressure.  Also: CINDERED, ECCRINE, ENTICER, EIRENIC, GENTRICE, GENERICS.
