>Mike_Ryan: ACHI 8E CHIA +18 18
#note Western Canadian Champs, Early Bird 2, Game 8. I fluked my way to a 7-1 tournament win just the day prior, and now I can't catch a break on my way to last place. A perfect example of how random Scrabble can be!
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DENTVZ G7 D.ZEN +27 27
#note Man, I spend way too much time on the early moves. I know I was stuck here for at least several minutes. Why didn't I like Z(I)T or Z(I)N? I have a blank already so turnover isn't a priority.
>Mike_Ryan: A H8 .A +13 31
#note What, you have a blank too, Mike?
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AIIOTV E3 VIATI. +22 49
#note I always forget VICTORIA is an acceptable word, even though I didn't see it anyways. The huge A-hook never even dawned on me here, either.
>Mike_Ryan: ABEISTU 10A BEAUTI.S +67 98
#note Pretty cool find there, Mike.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?COORVW C10 .VOW +20 69
>Mike_Ryan: EELNRST 4D S.LENTER +68 166
#note Ouch. And why didn't I know RELENTS anagrams to NESTLER? That plays for 79 down below, a little on the crazy side.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CFOORT B3 FOOTRaC. +64 133
#note I thought about wether CRa(B)FOOT was valid, for a lot more points. It sounded like it could be some kind of foot defect, who knows! Took the safe route. I didn't see the alternate sOFTCOR(E).
>Mike_Ryan: EJOY A1 JOEY +68 234
#note Well, that couldn't have been much worse! I guess I was due to have a really bad tournament. I had JUST gotten to 1600 though and the way things were going, it was going to vanish as quickly as it came. 
>Matthew_Larocque: AIKNOOP 3G PIANO +27 160
#note CHIAO is one of those words I'll always miss if I have to form it with a hook. KOP for 44. And I need to keep AVIATIC open but I'm still oblivious to that. This sims pretty pretty meh.
>Mike_Ryan: AGIO 5K AGIO +16 250
>Matthew_Larocque: GKMNNOU D12 MONK +43 203
>Mike_Ryan: HIST 15D .ITHS +36 286
>Matthew_Larocque: BGLNRUU H1 RU..G +18 221
#note Ugh. What a disaster. I pondered over several plays, including short B(ORA) plays. (B)ULGUR stands out, but it's not like know a lot of sixes with 2 Us. Forgive me. I didn't know BURL(I)NG either.  LUB(I)NG/BLU(I)NG sim around 3rd/4th though - I think I liked my play just because it stuck the R out in the open.
>Mike_Ryan: EM A7 EM +23 309
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BDLNRU M3 BU.LD +20 241
#note UNBR(I)DLe. Even now that sounds strange, I think I've only ever heard it used with a D on the end - so it comes across as more of an adjective. Such as UNLOVED but no UNLOVE.  
>Mike_Ryan: IQ N2 QI +26 335
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADINRU 14H UNAIReD +70 311
#note Wonder if he woulda challenged IRAcUND? He gave a quick hold on this before he could remember it.
>Mike_Ryan: DEX 15M DEX +38 373
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEERTW 13K TEW +28 339
#note Awful. This game would have ended a lot closer if I had seen (B)EWARE. TEW sims incredibly bad presumably because of the leave.
>Mike_Ryan: EEFOR A10 .EFORE +45 418
#note He also wouldn't have gotten this huge play.
>Matthew_Larocque: AAEELLR 6I ELL +9 348
#note A(VIATIC) is screaming at me at this point. I'm not even trying anymore.
>Mike_Ryan: GNPSY 8M SPY +33 451
>Matthew_Larocque: AAER 12M ARE +11 359
#note (P)ARAE is the outplay, I didn't know it.
>Mike_Ryan: GN O11 G.N +4 455
#note GN(AWED) is his best out.
>Mike_Ryan:  (A) +2 457
#note Lol, I even had 2 blanks this game. I was just hoping the main tournament wouldn't be as big a trainwreck as this one.
