#note the leave here is just too terrible. my bingo percentages after wait are extremely low. sacrificing 7 points now and playing oot to keep a more balanced leave wins the sim.
>Scott_Garner: AFNT 14F FA.NT +18 161
>jd: ?DOOSTU 13B OUTDO +17 192
#note holding the blank it might be reasonable for me to gamble and open the triple lane, but there's a reason the two spots for outdo are very even on win percentage.

#note the top-simming play is burning the blank for 32 and playing VIGOR. I can see why that might be the case given how closed the board is but it's a tough play oto make, especially because there are so many tiles left and I should be able to set up lanes.

#note I clearly need to do something a little weird here, but I don't like quackle's top choice of lopes at all. sorel at 10J doesn't look terrible, but I don't think I prefer it to my play.

#note I would say this play must be wrong because it creates new lanes. blur/burl/burr holding the z sims best - bingo percentages are 15% versus 23% after braze or azure.

#note belch should be slightly better...I was down to almost no time at all. I wonder in retrospect if there's a case to be made for playing blench right off the bat. it empties the bag and loses to any bingo, but it also doesn't give him the turn he used to fish after BENCH. It's tough to figure that out from looking at a sim.
