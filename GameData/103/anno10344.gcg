>Juraj_P: ?EGORSU 8D GOUgERS +68 68
>E_Tran: AEIIRTV J6 VI.A +15 15
#note I wanted to make sure to open the bottom right of the board; Figured there would be ways to open up the top-right.
>Juraj_P: EO 9D OE +7 75
>E_Tran: EIPQRTT C9 TITRE +16 31
#note Hoping for at least 31 pts next turn.  Again, this also helps open the board, and I want to have an open board when I'm down.  9C P(OE)T sims best, which I didn't see.
>Juraj_P: DEO 12C .ODE +10 85
>E_Tran: CMOPQYZ K9 MOPY +26 57
#note He is obviously fishing.  I wanted turnover, and to try to block his easy bingo lines.  Missed G11 COZY
>Juraj_P: AEILRSW 11H SLI.WARE +63 148
>E_Tran: CCDQRUZ O8 CUR.D +30 87
#note Hate what this does to the board, but it seemed necessary.
>Juraj_P: AJNN M9 JN.NA +40 188
#note This is worse for the board
>E_Tran: CENNQWZ 7C NEW +17 104
#note Wanting to create more space.  Also creates more spots for my Q and Z, while helping to open the board.
>Juraj_P: ADEILSV 14I DEVISAL +89 277
>E_Tran: ACLNQTZ B10 QAT +71 175
#note Finally I hit it!

>E_Tran: BCFLNOZ 14D COZ +65 240
#note Two in a row!
>Juraj_P: GI G6 IG. +5 302
#note Type a note here!
>E_Tran: BDFLNUX F3 FLUX +55 295
#note OMG. 3 in a row.
>Juraj_P: GHOU 4B GHOU. +18 320
>E_Tran: AABDNOP B2 PA.ODA +35 330
#note Eep.  DAGOBA.
>Juraj_P: IM 15N MI +22 342
>E_Tran: BBFHNNN -BBFNNN +0 330
#note Thought the H was good for scoring.  Nothing else looked good.  Sim suggests exchanging all for Win, but keeping H for value.
>Juraj_P: Y N13 Y.. +13 355
>E_Tran: ?EHIKOT C1 KIT. +30 360
#note I took a good 15 minutes on this play.  Given my previous exchange, his leave was some combination of AEEEIRSTT: likely AEIRST or EEIRST.  He has a 3/8 chance of drawing FAINTERS / FERNIEST.  Given these inferences, K(AY) is best, so I can counterbingo to beat him.  I considered that, thought I needed the pts.  KITH sims thirdish, but 20 Win% behind K(AY)
>Juraj_P: AEEIRST 12K .E. +22 377
#note Juraj told me after the gamethis was his rack.  
>E_Tran: ?BEFHNO H1 FOEHNs +54 414
#note Best
>Juraj_P: ABEIRST 2G B.ASTIER +74 451
>Juraj_P: ABEIRST --  -74 377
#note Obvious desparation play
