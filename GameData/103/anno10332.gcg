#note I didn't consider A12 EURO, but it's worth thinking about. I think I still like my play on an open board. I don't want to limp through an III leave while oppo gets to cash in on the good spots.

#note Augh... damn I missed the 2x2. Just didn't look hard enough and I was happy to kill that D lane. ANTINUKE is a huge equity loss.

#note Going for turnover to race to the endgame.

>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEFJMOR 1A JO. +39 396
#note Ah, I missed the beautiful BE(W)ORM. That's more of the turnover I was eager to get. Still, I has happy with this play keeping the nice clunkers. Bernard was proving difficult to pull away from.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: ASTY M2 .ASTY +41 383
>Matthew_Tunnicliffe: BEFMORU H11 B.UME +27 423
#note Nothing really stands out here. A lot of plays which score decently and keep a good tile for next turn. So I'm not really sure why I settled on this. I guess I just liked leaving exactly 2 in the bag, and the F seemed really powerful on this board. But then why not just do D11 BUM? Turnover is risky when I might pick III or something.
>Bernard_Gotlieb: DERW 2B W.R +22 405
#note Bernard said he wasn't sure of WARED, which would have made this a close game.
