#note Atlantic City, Division 2. Round 18. If I win this game, I win the tourney. Otherwise, we play again in the final round to decide the victor.
>Adam_Ginzberg: BEIIRRS 9E RIBIERS +71 71
#note Was not 100% sure of this. Suboptimal placement was a result of trying to play it as quickly as possible. For this play and throughout this game, another motivating factor for me was to play quickly, for Mark was constantly in time trouble throughout the tourney.

>Adam_Ginzberg: CEIILNU 1F NUCLEI +26 333
#note This is a very interesting position. He undoubtedly has at least one of the blanks and six other tiles from a pretty promising pool. I could block rows 14/15 with a play like CULT, however I still figure I lose after blocking his bingo. With NUCLEI I attempt to turn over tiles and draw a blank and ideally bingo out after his likely bingo next turn.
