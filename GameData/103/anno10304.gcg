>Suhas_Rao: AGINP L8 APING +21 176
#note I guess he doesn't see the GLOBE hook.
>Ryan_Fischer: FHNORTY N6 NTH +20 207
#note Really proud of this play.  Champ finds it, too.  It's only a bit better than (R)HYTON, but it guarantees me at least 45 next turn, and probably more, and he can't even block with an A.
>Suhas_Rao: ACEN 11J CA.E +12 188
#note And I was so hoping he'd open an E for FROGEYES.
>Ryan_Fischer: EFGORSY O8 YORE +51 258
#note Was so hoping he'd stick out an E.  YE is better.  Os fading.
>Suhas_Rao: OTU D10 .OUT +8 196
>Ryan_Fischer: ADEFGSU 14A FUDS +21 279
#note FUDS, because I'm killing that hook immediately.  No letting him fish and get back in.  The bingos will be babies.  I have the G for the hook up top, which he doesn't even see, either.  I can sacrifice giving up what will probably be a 30-point play here in the name of defense.
>Suhas_Rao: ADT A12 DA.T +30 226
>Ryan_Fischer: AEGQRUW 1I QUAG +26 305
#note So much for that.  Q static says why not WAG there?  I don't know.  No real place to play the Q for much.
>Suhas_Rao: F 1N .F +15 241
>Ryan_Fischer: DELMRSW 11C M.DS +37 342
#note HAIKA does not take an S.  I thought one of those was fishy, but wasn't sure which.  Oh well.

#note I really wish I understood what Q was thinking sometime.  It says fish off the U 6I VUG 15.  I need to block.  ZEES and the like for 46 and not give him a comeback.  UN(NOTICeD) is finally in play.  I don't see a bingo in play with that fish, so I don't see what it accomplishes.

#note S(C)hIZO or (C)ROZE static.  Champ says 9H SEI 18 first.
