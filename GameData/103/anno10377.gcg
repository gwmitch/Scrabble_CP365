#note Eric was on a nice streak for the first two days of this tournament before fading a bit at the end. I'd never actually heard of him before this tournament.

#note after that last move there's not a ton I can do to block, so I mgiht as well try to balance my own leave. I played very slowly this game. also reindexed is still posible.

#note this is totally not the right play. holding onto the QU combo on a board with this many open hotspots is a great idea. I average 17 more points per turn after BLOWN than I do after quip. that said, leaving two triple-triples open does take some guts.

#note phew

#note blowy leaves me with a much more flexible leave, but blocking the 3x3 is worth something
>Eric_Cahanin: PRU N13 PU. +42 215
>jd: BELNNOW C11 BLEW +28 318
#note I didn't want to open another 3x3, but why not play BLOW and set up my N? duh. besnow kills the sim, which makes sense.

>jd: ?ALNNOR M12 NA.. +34 352
#note somehow I was already down to panic-level amounts of time in spite of not making very good plays with quip and blew. I play a lot slower when I'm tired. didn't have time to find nonlabor but this is right up there.

#note aghhhhhhh what was I thinking. OLD would've been great. this just gives him a road back into the game.

#note shit, I could use a vowel. the pool is overwhelmingly vowel heavy, but I should really play two consonants here. I'm still the heavy favorite but playing another consonant eliminates some disaster scenarios.

it's interesting in this pool that keeping RSTT? appears to bingo more than NRST?. It hits the C more often and if I draw another T I still get to bingo quite often. sometimes leaves aren't obvious.
>Eric_Cahanin: SU 10J U. +4 385
#note I knew from the unseen tiles that he was screwed.
>jd: ?ENRSTT 3D TENTeRS +64 471
#note I think the right play here may actually be to fish off another T, since I can bingo unblockably next turn. still this wins every tmie.
