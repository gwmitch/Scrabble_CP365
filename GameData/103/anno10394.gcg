#note this isn't the worst idea ever except that it's totally not a word. playing BINGO makes the most sense I think. that said, phonying here is not so terrible, because there are no good lanes on the board right now

#note I think this is right but quackle prefers GONOF. row 5 seems way harder for her to hit. I would rather block 14 now.

#note gonof sims a little better again. for some reason I thought she might have been fishing for 9s through ER but I actually didn't see gonof at all. DEFTER probably gives her too much to work with.
>Leesa: ?AAEHIP C3 HA +13 318
#note she actually had aphelia and I blocked it
>jd: ?CGOORT B2 COG +22 402
#note I had little time and played this kind of fast but this is totally wrong. It gives her CAPOEIRA most of the time (didn't spot it) and even allows her to win if the two Is are both in the bag, in which case she can play APPEARED on row 11. this is a bad mistake.
