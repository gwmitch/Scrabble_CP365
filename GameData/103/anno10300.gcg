>Daniel_Milton: ?EIMOTU I2 TIMEOUs +72 72
>Ryan_Fischer: BDIIIRS J1 BIDI +20 52
#note (M)IDRIB is an option.  I need to get better at seeing that word.  Q evaluates BIDI better, though.
>Daniel_Milton: CRRUY K4 CURRY +27 99
>Ryan_Fischer: EILQRSZ L1 SIZE +44 96
#note Missed 1J (B)EZILS 81.  Funny, 'cause I'd play the singular later.  Harder when you don't have the B on your rack.  I chose SIZE over QIS... I don't know why.  I wanted to take the E hook on MIC, forgetting that I could just use the S with QIS since I'd have to anyway for a Z play.  So this was a mistake for two reasons.

#note Almost didn't see this.  But missed O1 (F)ILArIAE 83.  Time to review 5v8s.

#note Hard decision here.  Looking 4 turns ahead, C9 V(I)G looks good.  I don't know how often ABEH? bingos, but I guess it's a smidge better than BG?, which was what I took.  HEAVE instead of SHAVE to preserve the T.

#note 14B BuRGON(E)T 74.  I saw 13B RiNGBO(L)T but thought this was better.  It's Collins.  And I'm worried I'd have a hard time switching over. :P
>Daniel_Milton: ANSUY 12A YUANS +32 258
>Ryan_Fischer: AADEHNX 12K EX +41 410
#note And if I don't play STROBING and instead play RINGBOLT like I found (and not BURGONET which I probably still wouldn't find), I'd have HANDAXE(S) 15A 113!  Observing the event changes it.  Three left, so HEX is out of the equation.  There's AAHED 5A which is nice, but it banks on me drawing a vowel to play the X.  Plus, I don't want to empty the bag yet.  One of the Os for OX would be fine at 12N.  I already have EX.  Where's AAHND going, though?
>Daniel_Milton: GIO A12 .OGI +24 282
#note You know you're finally doing something right when you've tracked right and can predict with some probability your opponents play.  I looked, saw this, and lamented he blocked H(Y)DRA.

#note I had the right idea, wrong order, says Champ.  Good news.
