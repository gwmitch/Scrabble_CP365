>Andrew_Fisher: HIIQSTY 7H .HITY +18 18
#note Interesting - HIT/OH or HI/OH come out slightly better than my choice on win%, perhaps because a Q dump is virtually guaranteed next time. WHITY has a much higher equity figure though.

>John_Holgate: BEO J9 OBE +25 87
>Andrew_Fisher: ?AFOSVV 9F VO. +14 58
#note VAVS/OBES gives a marginally better win%, as does SOV at 12K.
>John_Holgate: AM 6I AM. +26 113
>Andrew_Fisher: ?AEFISV 11C lIFESAV.. +78 136
#note Just the one bingo here. John came right back with TROPINES through it, but luckily I had AJWAN H11 immediately to gain sufficient momentum for the win.
