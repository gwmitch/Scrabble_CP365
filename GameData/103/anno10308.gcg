>Matthew_Bernardina: ABGGNOS 8B GOBANGS +78 78
#note My punishment for playing so terribly the previous game.  One of us finally gets to blow the other out.  Whee~!
>Ryan_Fischer: EIJRTUW B6 JU. +27 27
>Matthew_Bernardina: DHLNOPR C4 PHON. +23 101
#note Q static says C7 H(O)LP 23.  PHON(A)L is okay, (A)LPHORN is very aggressive.
>Ryan_Fischer: AEIORTW D1 TAWIE +31 58
#note TOWIE, if this.  Q static says D3 WAIT 37.  Meh.
>Matthew_Bernardina: DDELRST E5 STR.DDLE +102 203
#note Aw.
>Ryan_Fischer: ALOOQRU 1A QUO.A +42 100
#note I don't know which is better, really.  At the time, I didn't see any extensions, Matt did.  I thought it best to leave the E alone and take this spot.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ABIPTTV 12A VITA. +24 227
#note F2 VITTA 29?  Blocks the extensions, and BP is clunky anyway.
>Ryan_Fischer: ELORUVY B10 VO.LE +32 132
#note Took me long enough to arrive at this, though RUY isn't going anywhere fast.
>Matthew_Bernardina: BEFINPT 11D F.IP +14 241
#note MATT: At this point, I'm thinking about keeping BE for (QUOTA)BLE

>Ryan_Fischer: IMNRRUY 3D .IRY +14 146
#note I don't even know.  This is so bad.  13E RIMY 23, hooking to make STRADDLER.
>Matthew_Bernardina: BDENOOT 4G OBENTO +27 268
>Ryan_Fischer: AILMNRU A1 .UAIL +15 161
#note Yeah, I don't know words.  13E RUMINAL 74.  I spend all my time looking at low-prob, hi-playability 8s.  So I totally miss lower 8s, and supposedly gimme 7s.  Ugh.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?CDELRY 13E DRY +23 291
#note QUOTABLY for 57, RECYCLED for 65.  FORCEDLY too.  Shift DRY one back for 26.  Good hopes of bingoing.
>Ryan_Fischer: EMNNORS 5G NOM +19 180
#note 2A (U)NM(A)N 25 (!).  Of note: PHONON.  I did this primarily to open another lane I might be able to hit.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ?ACEELO A12 .EAL +25 316
>Ryan_Fischer: EEENRSS 6H SERENES +71 251
#note ...of course he'll have a T...
>Matthew_Bernardina: ??CEEIO O4 COtErIE +87 403
#note Or worse, both blanks. :)  This or pICOtEE is fine.  Of note: (T)O(E)pIECEs, CI(N)E(R)EOuS!
>Ryan_Fischer: AEHMNRX N10 HAREM +49 300
#note HAREM/HERMA.   I totally forgot the latter.  Figured, save the X, he's gonna take that spot if I don't.
>Matthew_Bernardina: ACDIKRT 12L DI.K +28 431
#note Or O13 DAK 31.
>Ryan_Fischer: AFINUWX 7K FAX +45 345
#note I love Champ sometimes: J2 AW(N) 8 sets up UNFIX for 79!  Yeah, I love this game.  I'll love it even more when I can consistently make setups like that!
