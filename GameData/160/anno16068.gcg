>Deen_Hergott: HILTT H8 TILTH +24 24
#note Starting off with a five I don't know. Doubt is cast in my mind already.
>Joshua_Sokol: DDIIRSS I7 DID +16 16
#note I'm not playing 13F IDS for seemingly obvious reasons, but maybe it's the right play.
>Deen_Hergott: FOWY 10G F.OWY +28 52
#note This looked really fucking weird. And I suck for letting it slide.
>Joshua_Sokol: ACIORSS 11E COA.S +26 42
#note I considered intentionally phonying here with SCORIAS, but I was pretty sure Deen would know to challenge, and I wasn't even sure of TILTHS. I didn't, on the other hand, consider just SCORIA, which seems right.
>Deen_Hergott: PX K9 P.X +30 82
>Joshua_Sokol: AGINRRS -R +0 42
#note Not sure this is right, but it seemed best to me.
>Deen_Hergott: EMT J6 MET +17 99
>Joshua_Sokol: AGILNRS K5 GAL +16 58
#note maybe trying again with (DE)L? This doesn't look that good though I'm very likely going to be drawing an E.
>Deen_Hergott: AHIORT L3 THORIA +33 132
#note I held this. Didn't know THORIA or THORIAS...
>Joshua_Sokol: IJMNNRS M2 NIM +21 79
#note Do I burn the S for 13D JINNS? M2 NIMS?
>Deen_Hergott: AO E10 O.A +5 137
#note Pretty bizarre play. But it helped me gather the courage for my next move, which turned out to be a bad thing.
>Joshua_Sokol: EJNPRSU N1 JUN +27 106
#note In hindsight, 12B PUJ(A), but O(C)A seems really really fishy so I expected him not to have kept another O, and he only had 2 shots at OOOO last turn. But if he bingos next turn he has a lot more shots at the O's and I'm kind of screwed. I guess PUJ(A) or N1 JUN would have been safer.
>Deen_Hergott: NO O1 ON +36 173
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEORSU -EU +0 106
#note Hmm. I failed to consider L11 UDO, and would never consider L11 UREDO, but those may be good options. I felt (X)U failed most of the time. I also should have exchanged OU.
>Deen_Hergott: EF M8 EF +11 184
>Joshua_Sokol: BCDEORS 12A COBR. +24 130
#note 12D B(A)D or D12 BO seem alright, but I wanted to score at this point and hope for the best.
>Deen_Hergott: DEEIRST D4 REEDITS +70 254
#note A5 DESERTI(C) is what he was looking for. RESITED is one more.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEESWY 13B DYE +33 163
#note Weirdly enough I missed WYE in the same spot. WYES looks like a good option too. The bingo I didn't know was DYEWEEDS.
>Deen_Hergott: ?BEGILR 14D GERBILs +65 319
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEISW 15A AWES +30 193
#note 4B AI(R)WAvES but I need more than 61 and 7 fresh tiles.
>Deen_Hergott: AENRV 8A RAV.NE +27 346
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AAEINO N9 AEOnIAN +71 264
>Deen_Hergott: EIRU 15K URI.E +18 364
>Joshua_Sokol: AEGKPQV O7 VEG +28 292
>Deen_Hergott: ELNSUUZ B6 ZE.L +33 397
#note best
>Joshua_Sokol: AIKOPQT 13M Q. +22 314
#note Missed what C3 KOP does. -2
>Deen_Hergott: NSUU O11 NUS +20 417
#note -4 to L11 UN.
>Joshua_Sokol: AIKOPT C3 KOP +24 338
#note PREEDITS (OKAPI). -13
