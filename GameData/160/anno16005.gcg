>Joshua_Sokol: DDEENPT J6 PED +21 21
>Kay_Patterson: AEJN 5I JANE +29 43
>Joshua_Sokol: DENTTUX 9E TEXT +43 64

>Kay_Patterson: FOP 10D FOP +30 73
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGINOU L2 EUG.NOID +72 136
#note Phony. Oops. Confusing with EUGLENID probably.
>Kay_Patterson: AAIRVY K9 AVIARY +27 100
>Joshua_Sokol: EFHILSS M9 SELFISH +83 219
#note HISSELF is also in this rack. I conveniently only saw the playable bingo. I like playing lower probs.
>Kay_Patterson: DIW 15L W.ID +45 145
>Joshua_Sokol: DILRUUY O11 LURI. +7 226
#note YI(E)LD, missed it. Wanted to start shutting stuff down, starting with the most imminent danger.
>Kay_Patterson: ?QST 2J Qu.ST +66 211
#note YI(E)LD...
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGRSUU D10 .UGUED +26 252
#note Considered FUGU. That's probably better.
>Kay_Patterson: IOV 15A VOI. +24 235
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEGMOS J13 AMA +26 278
#note Seems about right.
>Kay_Patterson: ABLT 15F TABL. +21 256

#note 14M (S)K(I).
>Kay_Patterson: EMN 12H NEM. +15 287
>Joshua_Sokol: ENOORST O1 OSE +23 328
#note Why not just keep fishing? Hmm, I guess I was scared of the blank becoming an S. That's silly though.
>Kay_Patterson: BN I11 N.B +16 303
>Joshua_Sokol: ANOORRT A11 ORA +7 335
#note Ultrascared. I missed the obviously better C11 (C)AN. Accomplishing the same thing and scoring much more.
>Kay_Patterson: OW M6 OW +20 323
>Joshua_Sokol: CINORTY N4 CRONY +23 358
#note I guess I should block the only available lane and Z scoring spot with 4J CI(G).
>Kay_Patterson: ?EILNRZ 3G NaZI +34 357
#note She wins if she plays 3G RaNI, as it sets up ZE(a)L and LEZ/E(NEMA) for next turn. Luckily that's really difficult for most people to find.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIITT O8 AI +21 379
>Kay_Patterson: ELR H1 RE.L +12 369
#note Undeserved revenge! Hooray!
