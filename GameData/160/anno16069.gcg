>Jason_Broersma: AEEORSV 8C OVERSEA +78 78
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AINNRT E5 TRI.NNiA +78 78
#note INT(E)RNAl may be better, but I didn't know the S hook and Jason didn't know TRIENNIAL, so it worked out.
>Jason_Broersma: AHLL D11 HALL +22 100
#note This wasn't Jason's best play of the game, even though he likely had the S. There are 7 O's unseen, unless he has one of them, and of course, TRIENNIAL. I even prefer the 4 extra points of D12 HALL, personally.
>Joshua_Sokol: AFIILPU 14B PI.AF +36 114
#note I considered PAI(L)FUL, but I didn't think it was a better play and I wasn't sure it was valid. This was a lot of points. So is 13B FI(L)LIP. I didn't know it. Anyway, not sure what's correct here. Maybe 7H PFUI, but that leaves his setup wide open.
>Jason_Broersma: DGIS 15A GIDS +37 137
>Joshua_Sokol: CDILORU H2 CLOUDI.R +62 176
#note A good draw.
>Jason_Broersma: ABCETV 15F ABVECT +44 181
#note Man oh man should I have challenged this. I should have seen ADVECT. Really bad that I let 44 invalid points slide.
>Joshua_Sokol: EORSWXY 6H .OXY +31 207
#note Hmm, 9G O(R)YX is the same amount of points. I think it gives less back, but I don't know.
>Jason_Broersma: AFO 5J OAF +31 212
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIRSTW L9 WITHERS +93 300
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIRSTW --  -93 207
#note Cool, 93 points. A very weird situation for Jason, who manages to challenge the plural of the word he played as a valid word. Cognitive dissonance caused him a lot of trouble here. This is why challenging ABVECT was key.
>Jason_Broersma: DIKN 4K KIND +38 250
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIRSTW 2D SWIT.HER +70 277
#note Well, he gives me 103 points, but I didn't know SWITHER. I also missed WHISTLER. Ugh, really bad.
>Jason_Broersma: ENOPT K10 POTEN. +16 266
>Joshua_Sokol: AEELMQT F1 Q. +11 288
#note I hated playing this. Maybe LAME 1A and hope for a U.
>Jason_Broersma: ANOZ 1A ZONA +45 311
#note Yup, LAME.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILMT 2A AM +27 315
#note I missed EMAIL and MEALIE up top. Really really bad. G1 I(T)EM is cool. 
>Jason_Broersma: DEEGG 1K EGGED +32 343
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIJLTW C7 J.W +25 340
#note Not sure J11 JEW works out that well. I'm scared of the case S and of the blank, and he's playing more tiles than me. I need to make something happen... Not sure what, though.
>Jason_Broersma: ENO L12 ONE +14 357
#note Very fishy play.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEILRRT 3L REEL +21 361
#note Not sure why I didn't play RIEL. I'm just making really bad plays here.
>Jason_Broersma: OU 10J U.O +7 364
#note Weird play. Jason said he shouldn't have played that after the game was over.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIIRTY 2M AYE +37 398
#note This is simming best. The only thing that can outrun this seems to be some freak occurence. This was a lucky draw.
>Jason_Broersma: ?BEISTU A1 ..IBaTSU +63 427
#note Holy shitface.
>Joshua_Sokol: IIMRTU 4A .RIM +16 414
>Jason_Broersma: E I1 E. +5 432
#note Well, beautiful find on time pressure by Jason. He played this better than me for sure. I just made really bad plays.
>Jason_Broersma:  (TUI) +6 438
