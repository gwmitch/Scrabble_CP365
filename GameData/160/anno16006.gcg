>Kristina_Simon: CINTU 8D CUTIN +20 20
#note Game 26 and I just got back from lunch after losing two in a row. I actually emotional for the first time ever in a Scrabble tournament during lunch, and let my anger out on my pillows. I was convinced these two losses confirmed my fate of not winning the tournament.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEOPVZ F6 VO.ED +21 21
#note (C)OVED is one more and (U)PDOVE is better.
>Kristina_Simon: AAEMR D8 .AMERA +20 40
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHIOPZ C9 ZEP +53 74
>Kristina_Simon: EJK 13C J.KE +30 70
>Joshua_Sokol: EEHIIOO B10 HOE +35 109
>Kristina_Simon: DOTTY A11 DOTTY +40 110
#note She missed the much superior DOTTY 3 spots up. Goes to show that when I don't play defensive I'm setting myself up for disaster.
>Joshua_Sokol: IIIOORU -IIIOORU +0 109
#note Decided not to keep the R, since I wanted another shot at SSSS??
>Kristina_Simon: AB 7F .BA +17 127
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHNORR 14F HOG +28 137
#note I guess I was still feeling aggressive. I'm surprised I made this play.
>Kristina_Simon: FGO 15G FOG +35 162
#note And again, offensiveness fails.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEINRRX 6H RAX +29 166
>Kristina_Simon: ?CMOSTU J9 CUSTOMs +75 237
#note Switch the two S's. It may actually make a difference.
>Joshua_Sokol: EEGINRT 11G REE.TING +68 234
#note There's 3 points she lost because of her S placement.
>Kristina_Simon: DISSW M9 WI.DS +26 263
#note Another S is probable.
>Joshua_Sokol: ABLOSUW 5H BLOW +35 269
#note Just BOW maybe?
>Kristina_Simon: ADIL 4J LAID +25 288
>Joshua_Sokol: AAINOSU M2 AU.IO +12 281
#note Not sure if I should just score here with 3K NAOI or even 28 for 14A (T)AOS.
>Kristina_Simon: EEIIII -IIIEEI +0 288
>Joshua_Sokol: AENNQRS 10L Q. +22 303
>Kristina_Simon: EEF N6 FEE +27 315
>Joshua_Sokol: AELNNRS K3 N.. +6 309
#note At this point I was ultrascared, yet again, so I felt the need to be quite sure of bingoing or just forcing her to block. I should probably play O8 NAN, but the sim prefers N(AW). Alright.
>Kristina_Simon: APR 2L P.RA +12 327
#note Blocking but giving me points back.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEILNRS O1 L.NAI +18 327
#note Things aren't looking too good even though this is pretty clearly the best I can do.
>Kristina_Simon: EIT O8 TIE +15 342
#note I'm lucky she doesn't have V or Y.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRRSVY 11A ....Y +22 349
#note Close with H10 R(E)V on the sim. Why? I have no idea. This is the key scoring spot that I'm taking.
>Kristina_Simon: ?AS 14A .AoS +25 367
#note Just (CAMERA)S seems preferable, save (T)Ao(S) for later.
>Joshua_Sokol: ENRRSUV 13I R.VE. +9 358
#note She was running out of time, I was about to be low on it myself. Since this endgame is going to take too many turns to resolve itself, I don't think I can trust championship player's judgment here, but maybe I'm wrong and I really don't have a win. This got rid of my V which was essential, and left (E)NS 9F for next turn. If she blocked that, I had US(E)/(AUDIO)S instead.
>Kristina_Simon: EIILN 10F .EN +8 375
#note The plays that I can find that win if she plays perfectly are G7 (BI)N and 9I I(C)E, (BI)N being the best. Anything else seems to leave her stuck with something.
>Joshua_Sokol: NRSU 7L US. +12 370
>Kristina_Simon: IIL L13 .L +2 377
>Joshua_Sokol: NR 7K R... +4 374
>Kristina_Simon: II -  +0 377
>Joshua_Sokol: N L7 .N +3 377
#note So this whole time I could have played G7 (BI)N(ER), which I guess neither of us knew.
>Joshua_Sokol:  (II) +4 381
#note I was quite happy about this win. But of course I only won cause she made a few blatant mistakes.
