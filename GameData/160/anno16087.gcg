#note BONGLIK(E)* seemed so appropriate for a tournament in Humboldt County, weed capital of the universe.

#note Wasn't sure if this took an S, but had an inkling that it did (it does).

>dacrON: AFIORUY N10 FU.IO +34 199
#note Turning point in the game - this is obviously best, right? Compare with H10 R(AM)IFY. AOU leave sucks, and the board already has tons of volatility, so why not keep the better leave?
>Cecilia: IQ A7 QI +48 223
>dacrON: AIIORSY K10 OI.Y +14 213
#note This is a really tough play for me. the contenders seem to be 15J ARIOSI, I6 AIRY, and this. Cecilia could have anything after FUZ(E)/QI, and there are two nice bingo lanes here, and I have a decent leave after OI(L)Y. But there is so much firepower in the bag, that I have to wonder if Quackle is right preferrin ARIOSI for 31, setting up the Y, and drawing 6 new tiles. Thoughts? I didn't consider ARIOSI - I have to wonder if I'd have taken it - it certainly falls in my wheelhouse of how I play Scrabble. Ultimately I was pretty fixated on OI(L)Y. Tunnel vision = bad.

#note I found it prudent to keep the rack together here with all of the Es unseen. Maybe it's better to take 6 more with RADIX and the friendly pool that remains. I certainly thought about it...

#note Cecilia is still in the drivers seat to win, but it's now much tougher. What to do here?
>dacrON: EEGINOS D3 OE +26 416
#note D11 (T)OE was my alternate here, to set up a potential lane - unfortunately it didn't appear that much played down there for me, and that a lot would play for her. It seems like my best option here is to keep pace and hope she runs into a few more consonants, or at least a rack that doesnt bingo.

#note Thought about trying to take some spread with (FUZE)EING* but chalked it up to annoyance, and made a bad play anyway, as I missed the spot for TU(B)AL.
