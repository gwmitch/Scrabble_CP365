#note OOPS!  2nd time I played WA that day.  Eric Cahanin challenged it off.  That was the only phoney that got off the board all tourney.   Played about 4 words I wasn't sure of this tourney and they didn't get challenged off.  (PELATES, OPRESSOR, UPBRINGS AND INROBES)

#note Hmmm...something between paleate and peltate....double oops.

#note should have played iodid at 14c. no a lot of other places to play a bingo.  
>Sid: ?GNORSS 14A SaRONGS +76 358
>Brett: ABDIILO E2 AIL +5 338
#note a8 libido.  another missed opportunity.  oil would have been better than ail.

#note Another blunder in creating a better out for his q.  
>Sid: EIINQTV B10 QI +35 416
>Brett: BDO C2 BOD +16 390
#note If I had played OIL instead of AIL, I could go out with BAD at 11e and win by 2.  I had many opportunities to steal this game but didn't capitalize.  This is my 11th tourney and I'm still struggling with tracking/time/board vision.
