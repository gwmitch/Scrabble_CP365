>Brett_Jackson: FGIT 8G GIFT +16 16
>Siddharth_Murali: IILNORU J6 LI.U +6 6
#note I could feel the suboptimalness on this play when I played it but this surprisingly simulates best according to Quackle.
>Brett_Jackson: ADEMRST K8 SMARTED +83 99
>Siddharth_Murali: AINOORY 12K .OYO +14 20
#note Although I'm deviating from my playstyle, I'm down by nearly 100, and I chose this because I can hook my own word and I just have to pray that he can't. This play simulates best.
>Brett_Jackson: AEU G7 A.UE +7 106
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEINRV O12 NAVE +33 53
#note Bad play. I haven't heard of VALERIAN, which I have no idea why, but this is still a full 7 points off from Quackle's best non-bingo play, AVIAN.
>Brett_Jackson: AEIIRST F1 AIRIEST +63 169
#note AIRIEST for 70 looks better. Both are comparably weak defensively.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEIJPRW 1E J.PE +39 92
#note This play simulates second and is ever so slightly behind JEW for 29.
>Brett_Jackson: MY F9 MY +32 201
>Siddharth_Murali: AAEILRW E9 AWL +26 118
#note AW(A) 13M 27 and WAILER H10 39 are simming neck and neck, with AWA where I played AWL a tad behind. AWL is quite a bit behind that but Quackle loves L's/hates RAIE a lot more than I do. I'd probably play wailer though on a do-over because of the deficit and turnover, not either one of the AWA's.
>Brett_Jackson: BDI I1 DIB +24 225
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEIRUX 3I .EAUX +28 146
#note This looks good. It wins the sim by over 6 points.
>Brett_Jackson: INQ L2 Q.IN +26 251
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEINOR E1 .OE +14 160
#note Both static and the sim deem this best.
>Brett_Jackson: ?DELRTT 13E LiTTER.D +63 314
>Siddharth_Murali: ACEINRT N6 CREATI.N +70 230
#note Quackle thinks this is best with a mere 2% chance at winning but I don't know why INCREATE sims ever so slightly worse. It looks to be better in the long run.
>Brett_Jackson: CDHU H11 DU.CH +36 350
>Siddharth_Murali: EFGLNRS 2I .F +26 256
#note I was drawn to this right away, and perhaps a little too quickly. IF is right up there statically with RIF as the best static plays but I can see why Quackle loves ELF D11 26. It looks beautiful and it also opens up a beautiful lane. I didn't know FLITTERED though.
>Brett_Jackson: O 5E O. +4 354
>Siddharth_Murali: EGKLNRS 3A KEGL.. +22 278
#note I was also drawn to this immediately, but perhaps not too quickly. Quackle says this sims 3rd to LEK and KEG at M8 but I'm playing this anyday with a 98 point deficit. I've just been lulling along and I need something to happen, even if he (presumably) has a bingoey rack.
>Brett_Jackson: OO 5K O.O +6 360
>Siddharth_Murali: AHNORSZ M9 ZA +44 322
#note I decided to play this (sims 2nd) and just hope for the best. There's no way I'm playing AN(K)H, which is the play here according to Quackle.
>Brett_Jackson: ?EGINRS B2 R.SIGNEd +74 434
#note This is Brett's blunder. I'm sure he has better word knowledge and anagramming ability than I do, but to his defense, he was running very short on time. A flurry of -ING bingos starting at B1 for 70 wins around 98.5%, followed by GReEniS(H) for 86 at 97% according to the sim. This still has a 93% chance at winning. Brett unfortunately got burned for it though. Every % point counts!
>Siddharth_Murali: EHNOORS A9 ONSHORE +93 415
#note What an ending!
