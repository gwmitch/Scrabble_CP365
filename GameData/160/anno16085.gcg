>Eric_H: AACEMR 8G CAMERA +22 22
#note Tasha's "Division 1" Debut -  Episode 2.  Eric played this at 8D at first.  Then he played it somewhere else.  He decided on this placement in the end.  
>Tasha: EOPTTWY M7 YEW +28 28
>Eric_H: BEEGRW H4 BREW.GE +16 38
#note After the game, Eric said he just wanted to burn through the tiles to try to get the blanks.
>Tasha: HOOPTTU N9 OUTHOP +31 59
#note Getting away with phoneys is a bit of a science with me.  I wasn't sure if this was good or not.  ...Nah, I had to have known this was phony because I know OUTHOPS* isn't good.   OUTHOP* is the best play by far. 
>Eric_H: GHOT O7 GOTH +35 73
>Tasha: EFGLRTX O13 REX +36 95
#note I very seriously considered playing 15L FLEX (hooking the E to make OUTHOPE* which I know isn't good), but I rightly decided not to do so.  
>Eric_H: CDEEIR K3 DEICE. +18 91
>Tasha: FGILNTT J7 F.TTLING +73 168
>Eric_H: ABIO N4 OBIA +15 106
>Tasha: DINRSUV O1 RIND +26 194
#note I was set to play VIRUS until he played OBIA.  RIND is just blocking a crazy four ending with an F or Y.
>Eric_H: III -III +0 106
>Tasha: EINSSUV 11D NEVUS +30 224
#note I couldn't remember if FETTLING took an S or not.  It does.

>Eric_H: DV 4J D.V +14 159
>Tasha: ?AAIOST 13D SOnATI.A +59 293
#note I almost played ATONIAS, but I just couldn't pull the trigger.  I didn't want to risk FETTLINGS not being good.  I saw AVIATORS but I thought the A landed in the 3x3 lane (it doesn't).  I almost passed up the bingo to play TAO since it's only 59 points, but then I thought, "Oh, what the hell...I need spread!"
>Eric_H: ?ALORSU B7 ROr.UALS +82 241
#note After the game, Eric said he was about to go ape because he thought I blocked his bingo with my own.  Thankfully, Eric didn't know that FETTLINGS took an S either.  
>Tasha: EEFILRU A3 REFUEL +38 331
>Eric_H: JKLMNYZ 12A Y.NK +46 287
#note Actual rack.  After the game, Eric told me I blocked ZONK with REFUEL.  YANK was his back-up play.
>Tasha: AEINPST 1H PINASTE. +83 414
#note Actual rack. :D
>Eric_H: AIJLMOZ 2F ZOA +36 323
>Tasha: EN M12 EN +15 429
>Tasha:  (IJLM) +26 455
#note Eric would get his revenge proper the next day.  In fact, that game was exactly like this one.  I bingo and pull AELQZ out of the bag and he bingos out, catching me with all the junk on my rack.
