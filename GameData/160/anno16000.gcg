>Matt_Bernardina: AEINO H5 ANO.IE +8 38
>Dave_Koenig: ?EEFIJR G3 JEFE +29 35
#note I didn't like JEE 10F as much for a few reasons.  I don't have an A, and I'm likely giving him a nice lane for AJEE.  Also, it begins to block up the board and lessens the chance that I will be able to get a bingo down on the next turn with my blank.  With this play, I now have open lanes from both F6 and G9.

>Dave_Koenig: ?EGILRT L1 GLITtER. +76 111
#note I saw OVERGILT for 4 points more but wasn't sure enough to play it.  I also saw my nine FALTERING, but it is not as good as my play.
>Matt_Bernardina: EELNSTU 11B ELUENTS +73 135
>Dave_Koenig: BELRSYZ B10 B.ZEL +44 155
#note I think I was right to pass up the higher scoring ZEBUS, because it burns the S and gives easy scores off the Z to the triple.  However, I missed that BREEZY scores just as much as this play and keeps a better leave.

>Dave_Koenig: EGRSTVY 13A Y.VES +43 241
#note Burning the S for eight extra points seemed worth it, as it is likely that one of us will hit A13-15 with a two tile drop soon anyway, closing down the S hook, and otherwise there is not a lot to do with the S on this board.  Also, it is significant that playing the S closes down the board more, because it takes away the URES# and UREA hooks on row 14.  Quackle's static evaluation likes GYVE 4D keeping a strong ERST, but with limited places to bingo and at this score, I do not like playing this way.  I would only choose it if I were trailing and needed the bingo to catch up.

#note Based on what Matt said after the game, he did hold these five tiles and two more.  I assume he traded down to ES.  He did say that he considered playing OGEES 1K for 24, but he didn't like his chances with the Q remaining.  He has a good point.  As you'll see from the rest of the game, it will be very difficult if not impossible to play the Q.  However, given the closeness of the game, OGEES seems like a lot of points to pass up.  It's a difficult call.

>Matt_Bernardina: EIMNORS O3 MERINO +48 348
#note Matt did exactly the right thing here.  He just had to hope that I drew the Q after bingoing.  Unfortunately for him, he drew it right back.
>Dave_Koenig: ILNOOTX E5 NOX +35 398
#note Since I have the final I, I chose this instead of LOX in order to give me a spot to play QI, should I draw the Q.  He would surely block it, but the point is to limit his options.  Even if I draw the Q, I may have enough of a lead to hang on to win.  The trick will be not to play my tiles out too quickly, so as not to let him get a bunch of extra scoring turns.

>Dave_Koenig: EEILOTW C6 WE +15 413
#note Threatens to go out quickly with TELOI/TOILE if he delays cashing in on the S, but the real point of this is to set up a slow play.
>Matt_Bernardina: ADDQS J1 A.S +20 391
>Dave_Koenig: EILOT 4L .I.. +4 417
#note I'm waiting for him to hook a D to make WED so that I can score a few more points.

>Matt_Bernardina: DQ D10 D... +5 403
#note Preempting his DURE with LURE would seemingly get me more for the L, but the problem is that he would respond LURED and take away the highest scoring place for my E.

>Matt_Bernardina: Q -  +0 403

#note Playing the E here sooner would have allowed him to get more for one of the D's by playing LAVED.
