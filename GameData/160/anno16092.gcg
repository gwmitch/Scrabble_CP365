#note 11H AGIO or this spot. Both block parts of the board off, this one nets an extra point. I'm not really sure which play is better still. Over the board I just opted for the extra point, figuring there was a good chance other plays might block the 11 row, while the lanes I was blocking might pose a threat later on. I like controlling and shaping the board, and I thought this play did a better job of that because I'm still up 52 going into his turn. If I can avoid a crappy draw, I can start controlling the board and force him to open. But the key is to not run into any terrible racks because it gives him a chance to close the gap. Unfortunately for me, It was all downhill from here.
>Doug: CGJLOPS 7C JO +38 143
#note C7 J(O)G seems to merit consideration here. 17 points is a lot to give up, but CGLPS vs CLOPS seems like a huge difference, especially because binoing is fast becoming important for the both of us.
>dacrON: IKOOOTT 6D TOOK +15 172
#note This was where things went south. The play itself is fine, it's just a very ill-timed draw, and I bailed Doug out of a sure trading situation.
>Doug: CGLPRST E5 L.G.C +27 170
#note You can see how I bailed him out here. :(

#note I could hold back the L for 4 less, or go with H12 (T)EFF. I don't like my chances after (T)EFF, and think I have to hope he didn't draw a 98th easy bingo.

>dacrON: AEEFMVZ 14D FEZ +41 316
#note I hate blocking the R and this lane, but it seems too much better. If he doesn't have the A now, there's still a last ditch effort to play through the B up top.
>Doug: AEEITUU H1 TU.AE +24 382
>dacrON: ?AEMQTV J2 Q.ATE +36 352
#note I considered a multitude of plays here: J2 Q(U)ATE, J2 Q(U)A, 15E MATE, O1 VA(S)T, A9 QAT. O1 VA(S)T is counterintuitive, but with IIIUU left, it sheds the absolutely dreadful V for some actual points, and I could potentially still score well with the Q next turn. I strongly considered this play, but decided I'd be better ditching the Q now and the V next turn, but that of course requires drawing some vowels, which perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to give up here. I wonder if I did make the psychological blunder here of remembering what was on the line because I really thouht VAS(T) might be a good play. I ended up with Q(U)ATE because I thought I might not even get a chance at a bingo if I didnt draw a Q bingo next turn after VA(S)T, but the V is just so bad...my only real mistake of the game, I think. Q(U)A may have the highest bingo% too, in which case it'd be the best play.

>dacrON: ?HIMNNV L1 HI.N +22 374
#note The best Quackle comes up with here is exchanging or 15G H(Y)MN, so I think it's safe to say I'm about toast. The worst part was that I didn't see any potential bingos from the V or Y with the MNV? leave, so perhaps I should've exchanged just on principle. I don't see there being any chance here.
