#note I totally didn't expect CLED to be worth 6.1 points. Whoops.

#note Exchanged 6.

#note This sims best. The downside is that this isn't actually a word.

#note Don't know how that L disappeared. Maybe I wrongly recorded my previous rack.

#note I spent about 5 minutes on this turn clueless what to play. It was weird because I first laid down MENACE and changed it to BAAL, so he figured out my entire rack. Turns out, after 50,000 iterations, MENACE sims best and BAAL sims 2nd best! Surprising since I actually had to scroll down to find BAAL on speedy's list :p

#note GAD 6B 21 was the best legitimate option. I played this in less than 10 seconds thinking it was good. In hindsight, I can't believe that I actually played it. I distinctly remember that tiny lowercase E to the left of RADIATE when I first did zyzzyva's high prob quizzes. Miraculously, he held and didn't challenge.

>Siddharth_Murali: EINNOUZ 13C NEON +24 310
#note There's no way I'm playing ZINE or ZONE. I feel like Quackle's a bit too reckless in these type of situations. After looking at at all the options, I prefer NINE a couple of spots to the left. This still doesn't sim terribly (8th for NEON and 5th for NINE).

#note This was a forced exchange. I now give him one chance to cash in a bingo on the triple.
>Scott_Garner: BLY 6A .BLY +29 275
#note Phew.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEERSSZ 14H RAZE +36 346
#note This sims a full 4 points better than anything else. I thought a bit too hard on this one.
