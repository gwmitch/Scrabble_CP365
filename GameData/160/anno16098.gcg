#note I guess you could say my cries for a B were answered!

#note Actual rack - only bingoes are I(T)EMI[s/z]ED for 60. Perhaps E11 DIME is the play here. Mike took 4-5 minutes on this play, so I figured there to be a decent chance he had a blank if he was willing to play off 3 tiles from a good rack after that long.

#note Accounting for the EIM? leave, it looks like mike had bingoes here, too. I believe he kept another vowel, but I'm note sure. Don't think he'd play this if he kept the J he played next turn...anyway, a break for me.

#note Talked myself out of FIT(C)H, yikes! One of three word knowledge mistakes in this tournament. I like this play over the more obvious F(E)H. Fortunately I've got wiggle room, and the F has some flexibility here, to dampen my error.

#note My impression over the board was that I was being too paranoid about the E, and should take the points with 10F POM. Keep in mind I still have him with a blank. Even so, upon reflection, I think I was right to question my decision making: POM is better.

#note Was all set to play 5H TOMB when this turned me into a scaredypants. The options I really see are blocking like this, sticking to my original play of TOMB, or ignoring all threats and playing POM 10F. POM seems foolhardy, but Quackle's opinion is to take those points. I'd rather take out the more deadly spot, as I think I am still in OK shape at the very worst if Mike does manage to bingo at 5H. What's the right threat to block? Is MOB a conclusion reached with paranoia? I feel like I'd make this play again, but I'm not convinced. Note there is also K11 MO(JO) which blocks row 15 as a bingo threat, but retains a suboptimal leave for 9 more points.

#note Apparently holding the P back is better according to the endgame sim. Probably an endgame where adding the S is the best play.
