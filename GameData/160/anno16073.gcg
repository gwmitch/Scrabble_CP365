#note Old MacDonald had a farm...

#note Lucky I had somewhere to use these otherwise useless tiles.
>Sal_Piro: ADEKMNS M6 DESKMAN +80 104
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EJNOWX 1G JE.ON +36 96
#note I figured the spot would probably stay open and that I had a good shot at LLLTTTTT for L(U)X/T(U)X. I probably should just take the points with H1 EX.

#note Finally some luck! :P

#note Playing it safe. Maybe too much.

>Joshua_Sokol: AEHLMRT 13H .HRAM +32 287
#note Maybe G13 HAM for sort of defense and better leave.
>Sal_Piro: GIO F2 GI.O +22 251
>Joshua_Sokol: AEEILTY N9 AY +34 321
#note I was losing a lot of time on this turn since this play was so tempting. I finally played it because if Sal bingos, he bingos, but if he doesn't, he'll be killing two good lanes with his play most likely, which I want.
>Sal_Piro: CHIST O5 CHITS +37 288
#note Can I infer another S? Maybe it's just two other consonants.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILLT L6 LI. +12 333
#note I guess G3 L(O)DE. I wasn't sure what to do here.
>Sal_Piro: AFS G3 S.FA +28 316
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DEEILT J10 DE.. +9 342
#note I think I must have missed DETaILE(R)... Not sure if bingoing is correct here. I was really happy to see that blank though. I wanted to make it so that I could bingo if I needed to so I decided to create this lane.
>Sal_Piro: FS 11I F.S +31 347
#note I should have bingoed.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEILTU H8 .UE +5 347
#note I'm really letting this game slip away from me.
>Sal_Piro: ATZ 14E TZA. +33 380
#note I was quite unhappy when he laid that down.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EILNRT 7A LINTERs +64 411
#note OK, I missed (SOFA)R here. I felt like leaving one in the bag was my best shot here, so I decided to bingo, reluctantly. The 3 points I lost here were important.
>Sal_Piro: BBEI A4 BIB.E +36 416
>Joshua_Sokol: ADIOOTV 15D TOAD. +26 437
#note I was losing time here, so I lost points in the endgame. I tracked correctly so I knew this won, and I jumped on it.
>Sal_Piro: AIOO 3I .OO +13 429
#note He said afterward that he should have played AI/AE first.
>Joshua_Sokol: IOV 10F VO. +14 451

>Sal_Piro:  (I) +2 439
#note I managed to pull this off but I almost threw it away. I wasn't happy with this win.
