>Siddharth_Murali: FOORSSW I10 WOOFS +24 42
#note I'd seen some annotated games from 2000+ players who would retain the second S because the opponent knows that you have an S in a two tile leave, but I'm not convinced. WOOFS sims better than WOOF but both SOW and FROW (i6 and i5 respectively) are flipflopping as the two best plays, probably because of the dangerous h12 spot. Another reason I tacked on the S is to make it harder for Scott to use that spot, but that difference is pretty much negligible anyway because any vowel can stack in front of the S. I still don't know in hindsight if I should have played FROW or SOW over WOOFS. It's tough.

#note Couldn't find anything better but the difference between most of these bingos is marginal.

#note It was tough for me to pull the trigger on this one, but this is necessary- and simulates best.

>Siddharth_Murali: EEEEINS J6 NEE +19 225
>Scott_Garner: AEX J1 AXE +53 238
#note I knew this was coming but I probably needed a more balanced rack to effectively block it as well as keeping my rack in tact
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEEIIS 10G ...IE +13 238
#note Considered exchanging but this move does a lot of good things. With two consonants I could easily draw into a bingo with the floating D and L. This sims second to EIDE but I don't really like EIDE because it a) opens a hotspot (which I probably can't take advantage of by keeping bingo tiles) and b) If  I draw into a bingo it's most likely going to me a no-go. YOWIE is deceptively good in that it keeps the D and the L open as well as it opens an S lane considering that now I'm down a tempo.
>Scott_Garner: AOPPVV K3 VAV +24 262
#note Scott said he didn't want to play AVO/OVA for 10 extra points because he would hold two P's and a V, and based on this partial rack, Quackle agrees with him. This also is a better response to my last play.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEIRST C8 STEA.IER +70 308
#note It worked!
>Scott_Garner: GOP 15A GO.P +30 292
>Siddharth_Murali: ?EGILNU A8 GrUELIN. +80 388
#note After this unfair draw Scott didn't really have a chance.
>Scott_Garner: IJT E10 JI.T +22 314
>Siddharth_Murali: CDEGMRR K8 DR.G +18 406
#note I took a long time on this play, picking it back up and putting it back on at least 3 times, but the sim thinks this is better than anything else by a hefty 8 points.
>Scott_Garner: LR 4I .L.R +19 333
>Siddharth_Murali: CEEEMNR M2 REM +17 423
#note I played this to both minimize bingo opportunities and block Q plays. Something like MERC could potentially lose to ACQUIT.   After REM though, even if he bingos, I get a playback on the triple.
