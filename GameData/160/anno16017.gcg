#note EGU is actually EGO and DOPE is actually DUPE but I'm not going back to make the correction.  
>Brett: AAIJLUY I1 LAY +24 356
#note OK...BT was in the bag.  My mistake was thinking he would not be able to score much off an l.  I really can't beat myself up about this.   Do I play JAY at i1, Hoping for a t?  Maybe, since he'd be hard pressed to score elsewhere.
