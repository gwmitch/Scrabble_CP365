#note This play seems INFErIO(R) to...well yeah you get the pun.
>dacrON: AAOSVYZ 9F AZO +48 179
#note Ooh, the slightly counterintuitive 3C SAVOY looks like it could be better here. It seems to hinge on me drawing another big Z play though. I think I'd take AZO again, but maybe I'm wrong here.

#note I figured 10B VASTY and 5D QUAY were about equal, but I completely spaced on 14J VASTY.

#note I considered the sim winner (why and how is that best, Quackle??), as well as a bunch of other plays I despised, but unfortunately missed the only play here that looks any ood to me - K2 FR(I)T(T). Not sure how I missed it, as most of my energy was devoted to that area. This play sucks, but I just couldn't figure out what to do. I was hoping to learn something here, but no, I just missed the best play.

#note Debated this a good 5 minutes, then finally put it down. It's no good, not even in Collins! Jerry didn't hold either, as it's a pretty plausible word. Is it the right play though? He can definitely outscore me to win still - maybe PR(I)N(T)? 
>Jerry: EH 14F HE. +35 360
#note Jerry noticed (AVOW)E(R) right after he made this play.
>dacrON: AEINNOO 14F ...ONE +28 395
#note Asking champ player with 3 in the bag is testing the limits, but the avg. win % after this is in the low-to-mid 90%, versus around 60% after EH/AVOWER. Given what's in the bag, I'm golden either way, but it could have been a costly mistake for Jerry.
>Jerry: AEGHNOU 8A GNA. +24 384
#note 13K G(L)UON or C1 AGUE appear to be the best sequences here, losing by 18 in the end.

#note FYTT(E) was one of my worst plays of the tournament. Shouldn't have given up so easily on the JIBER spot.
