>Joshua_Sokol: AAAEIIP -AAAIIP +0 72
#note I didn't like the P on this board much.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: OX I7 OX +22 49
#note Getting fastplayed.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EENOQT -EQ +0 72
#note I really didn't want to keep the Q either. Maybe keep ENT? EENT?
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DMO 9H DOM +30 79
#note Really getting fastplayed.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?EEENOT F2 .EE +10 82

#note K5 NEOTENy missed.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ILP 5D LIP +23 102
>Joshua_Sokol: FOOOSTU C3 TOFU +23 178
#note hmm, didn't consider 6B FOOTS.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AW D3 AW. +24 126
>Joshua_Sokol: ?DLNOOS K4 NOODLeS +70 248
#note ELEVATEDS is good? Damn... I missed (N)ONSOLiD. Preferred not to open a huge (E)Q spot.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: DGRU 6J G.URD +15 141
>Joshua_Sokol: GHIMORV N6 .IG +5 253
#note Damn, no E. I want to block though. I figured she was really unlikely to have the last O. Not sure if this was a good play or not.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AA 8M A.A +12 153
#note Fastplayed still
>Joshua_Sokol: HIMORTV 8G V.. +13 266
#note I considered MIRTH but decided against it cause it looks more volatile than it seems at first view. I didn't want to lose a lot of time.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: FI L10 IF +7 160
>Joshua_Sokol: HILMORT B6 MIRTH +34 300
#note I guess it's about time to play MIRTH. I didn't see (G)LI(M) J6 until much later.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAENRST 11B SANTERA +75 235
#note Damn... I hate when that happens.
>Joshua_Sokol: CIIILOS A8 OI +14 314
#note Wasn't quite sure what to do here again. I liked my chances with this play, and it also shut down the most dangerous spot. Scored as 16 for some reason.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: ERTZ 4K .ERTZ +48 283
#note Fastplay fastplay, I'm down to like 6 at this point.
>Joshua_Sokol: CEIILSS 12J CIS +22 336
#note This was fortunate. I didn't know SIALIC, I could have played it at C9. I also could have saved this spot. I was scared that I would need to bingo again to win.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: AAINRU A1 ANURIA +26 309
#note Good thing she didn't have (A)QUAE here.
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIILQS E9 QA. +12 348
#note Didn't like having to play this, but at least it blocks a lot of potential lanes.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: HP F10 H.P +29 338
>Joshua_Sokol: EIIKLOS J6 .LI. +27 375
#note Finally saw it.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: CDNU H11 .DUNC +30 368
>Joshua_Sokol: EEIKOSY 12C YE +19 394
#note I was low on time.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: BBGWY 13G G.Y +13 381
#note At least I knew she had this crap. -16 to 14F WY(N)
>Joshua_Sokol: EIKOS 14D EIKO. +22 416
#note -11 to 13A OKE.
>Kate_Fukawa-Connelly: BBW 10K ..BB +14 395
>Joshua_Sokol: S F2 ....S +16 432
>Joshua_Sokol:  (W) +8 440
#note I almost screwed this one up, good thing I had much better tiles than her.
