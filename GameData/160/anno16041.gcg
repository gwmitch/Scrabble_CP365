#note I'm posting this game because it's a perfect example of the results of Quackle helping me with my attitude in impossible situations.  Also, here's a little context:  This is the second time I played Scott on this night and during our first game, I was STARVING.  I know he heard my stomach growling, but he's too much of a gentleman to say anything.  Another club player got me something to eat.  She actually came back during our first game, but I'm a notoriously slow eater.   So, I'm happily snacking on a McDonald's Southern chicken sandwich (with cheese :D) in this game.  Also, Scott played me and the other player at the same time.  COOL!

#note Oh NO...I missed IMITATOR for 90.  TRITOMA is the best non-bingo play.  Scott holds my play, but doesn't challenge.

#note I forgot to write my rack down here, but I remember I had 10 I's and an H.

#note "Cool play!" says Scott.  I hesitated to leave BQ, but I wanted points.

#note Scott shook his head after I played ADZ.  So I'm thinking I might have blocked a bingo.  I forgot to ask him what his last tile was, but he obviously didn't have a blank or S.  I can scratch off an extra N too.  I'm thinking he had an R and I blocked INGRATE.  Or maybe he was just shaking his head out of annoyance at me scoring 47 points...

#note "Cool play," says Scott.
>Scott_G: ?EINORY K4 jOINERY +75 377
#note Annoying, thinks Tasha.
>Tasha: ABCOPRT H1 BOP +28 271
#note I thought I had CARTOP on column L, but not quite.  You see, I wanted to play another cute six.

>Tasha: AACEERT 8K .ATER +18 289
#note In several ways, this is perhaps my most annoying rack in the game, but  I actually made the right play.  The idea is to open things up.  Downright fishing is pointless on this board.

#note I was perfectly calm throughout the entire game.  Being distracted by my chicken sandwich (with cheese :D) helped too.  Maybe the game would have been different had I not missed IMITATOR, but I like the fact that I tried to make the best of what I had.  ...also....Scott would go on to win both his simultaneous games. :)
