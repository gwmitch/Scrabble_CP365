>Terry_Kang_Rau: ENOV I9 OVEN +13 29
#note GOX forced a play like this most of the time, when an exchange is probably better.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAORSTU H12 AURA +18 45
#note Why not AUTO past Josh? Why not AUTO?

#note Why not Q(A)ID?...

>Joshua_Sokol: AEIORSW 10L .OW +21 103
#note I missed good plays here. 8J (N)OWISE and 12B AIRWO(MAN). I hoped she hadn't drawn SSSLL, but thought it even less wise to give her a shot at (JO)B/W/G/Y if I played WO/JO instead, which I should have played over JOW since even if she plays over JO I have the S hook.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: AAHPS O8 PASHA +47 178
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIKRSY 13L YAK +34 137
#note I'm starting to ask myself if I should try S(PEELING), but I don't like it.
>Terry_Kang_Rau: DORT K4 TROD +21 199
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIRSTU 14L SRI +35 172
#note Yup, I really should have tried it. I foresaw where this was going if I didn't.

>Joshua_Sokol: ??BCETU O1 Bo.CE +39 243
#note I felt I could outscore if SPEELING was no good. I failed to realize that I was done for if it was, and that I needed to try it.

>Joshua_Sokol: ?DINTUV -  +0 243
#note Forced challenge. Maybe I have a chance if I don't challenge.
