>Noah: DIIOTTU 4H OUT.ID +20 39
>CBB: AACEIMO 9D CAEOMA +28 134
#note cBB: vs the J9 plays of AMICE and AMIA. I got caught debating this and AMICE that I never really gave AMIA the proper thought it deserved. It's only 2 less than CAEOMA and yeah, CEO is much better than I on a board with plenty of bingo lanes. This is definitely a mistake on my part, although I'm at least glad I made the right distinction between CAEOMA and AMICE, which had been bugging me.
>Noah: AAGIIST H1 AGI. +15 54
>CBB: DIIIOOU -IIIIII +0 134
#note cBB: I wonder if I'd have been able to play through this after AMIA? Not having a chance to continue scoring and doing productive things to the board really hurts against a point machine like Noah.
>Noah: AFGISTX 10E AX +52 106
#note Noah: I saw F(I)X but not FAX G1. Maybe FAX is better?
>CBB: ADEMRTZ 10J Z.D +33 167
#note cBB: I thought of the almost E(C)ZEMA, then couldn't come up with CZAR. When I saw Z(E)D, I more or less fixated on it, as it blocked some lanes and kept a great leave (even better with this pool!)
>Noah: FGHILST 5B FLIGHTS +84 190
>CBB: AEEMQRT 3L QAT +41 208
#note cBB: Pretty sure I kept EEMR, but may have been EMRT.
>Noah: ?NORRSV N5 OV.RRuNS +68 258
>CBB: EEMORTY C2 MOT.EY +30 238
#note cBB: OK, well my work is still far from over. This is definitely a decision clouded by annoyance at Noah's rather ridiculous good fortune. I still need to work on not getting pissed off when I can see just how insanely lucky an opponent just got (I'm even getting annoyed in this writeup, so you know there's still work to be done.) MOT(L)EY saving ER is all well and good, but uh, REE(F)Y, and I already hold the M? 
>Noah: ?ADFINO B3 DI.F +37 295

>Noah: ?AINOOR D8 A.ROmION +82 377
>CBB: EEHINTT O12 .ITH +33 297
#note cBB: Noticed (K)HET right after I hit my clock. Still a result of annoyance - still gotta work on it.
>Noah: DEEJOSU 15A JEO. +33 410
#note Thought about JEU, but blocking the 3x3 seemed important here, as losing looks really unlikely without a 3x3.
>CBB: EEGNNVY 13C G.NNY +26 323
#note cBB: I guess VE(I)NY in the same spot.
>Noah: DEOSUUU -UUU +0 410
#note This exchange seemed strog for scoring. Just DOS may be a better keep actually, because I will almost always draw an E next turn.
>CBB: AEEPTVW 4A V..TAE +38 361

#note cBB: I hope this was my worst game of the tournament. *knocks on wood*
