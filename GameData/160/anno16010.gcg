>Joshua_Sokol: AEIINRU H8 URAEI +12 12
#note Who would play H8 AUREI? Exchange? I didn't consider either, unfortunately. 
>Karl_Higby: FLW 10F FL.W +18 18
>Joshua_Sokol: AAFINNT G6 FINA. +15 27
#note Nowhere for INFANTA :(.
>Karl_Higby: BMU 6D BUM. +17 35
>Joshua_Sokol: AJNOOTT D4 JA.OT +30 57
#note Not sure if anything else is worth considering.
>Karl_Higby: ADO 8A DOA. +15 50
>Joshua_Sokol: ?HNOQTT C7 H.NT +21 78
#note I could have played Qu(O)TH, I really considered it, but I thought that I could bingo soon anyway and NOT isn't amazing. I didn't like Q(I) 12G as I didn't see anything I could draw into and be pretty sure of bingoing with. Sort of difficult turn.
>Karl_Higby: ?AEILOT A8 .ELATIOn +77 127
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ALNOQT 12G Q. +11 89
#note SSSS left and he drew 7, I don't like playing G12 QAT. I6 QAT neither, as it blocks one of my useful lanes. 
>Karl_Higby: ACEERSX J4 CAREXES +83 210
#note I held him here, but released as soon as he drew his courtesy tiles. I didn't really have any way of knowing if that was a valid plural of CAREX, but I should have considered the fact that the board is mostly dead after I let it go, and that therefore the chances of me winning are very very slim. 
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AELNOT 15A .ONmETAL +68 157
#note I took a really long time on this turn. I missed (n)EONaTAL, LA(C)TONEs and fAL(C)ONET. Not sure those are better than this, but probably since I need the board to stay relatively open even if I add volatility. He held.
>Karl_Higby: DW E5 W.D +31 241
>Joshua_Sokol: DEGNNOP 14A .DEON +23 180
#note I was losing a lot of time on these plays. I didn't know PON(C)ED. I didn't see how to open the board here. Maybe P(A)NGED? I saw the I heavy bag and hoped for an ING word on lane 14 or through the C.
>Karl_Higby: DEM I5 MED +19 260
>Joshua_Sokol: GGHINNP 5I ..GING +20 200
>Joshua_Sokol: GGHINNP --  -20 180
#note I guess I need to try again with (T)HING 12A? I hoped it was good and I was wrong or that he wouldn't challenge.
>Karl_Higby: U 8J .U +9 269
>Joshua_Sokol: GGHINNP 5B GN.. +8 188
#note Do I play (E)NG 9G after a one tile play? Sometimes his rack might not be incredible I guess... I need an S if I play (E)NG or a bingo down low. Still losing too much time.
>Karl_Higby: AP 14G PA +10 279
>Joshua_Sokol: BEGHINP C13 B.. +10 198
#note I have no idea what to do. I guess just score with K5 PE... Maybe NEI(G)H B2 this turn, which I missed since I was trying to play fast and not lose even more spread. 4J (C)HIP seems alright. Maybe even 9J (E)PHEBI.
>Karl_Higby: ER K5 RE +17 296
>Joshua_Sokol: EGHIINP B2 NEI.H +34 232
#note L1 HINGE I guess.
>Karl_Higby: OOZ A1 ZOO +40 336
>Joshua_Sokol: AGIPRTU L1 PRUTA +26 258
#note Held again.
>Karl_Higby: GILY 2J GI.LY +26 362
>Joshua_Sokol: GIIIKSS 14G ..IK +20 278
#note Just spread collecting at this point I think.
>Karl_Higby: IS M4 IS +11 373
#note lol, at least he's not scoring anymore.
>Joshua_Sokol: GIISSTY 15J IT +8 286
#note The lane this creates seems to be unblockable but it's not like I can bingo with it... I guess just A1 (ZOO)S?
>Karl_Higby: EEORRVV D11 VRO.. +18 391
>Joshua_Sokol: CEGISSY C1 YES +21 307
#note At least I found the best endgame sequence...
>Karl_Higby: EERV 11D .EE +17 408
>Joshua_Sokol: CGIS L12 CIGS +20 327
#note I guess I should V stick him. No time left though. -11, scratch that "best winning sequence".
>Joshua_Sokol:  (RV) +10 337
