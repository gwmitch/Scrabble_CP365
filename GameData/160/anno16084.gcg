#note Least Favorite Play #2:  Not only did I miss a relatively easy bingo, but I play a phony instead.  And not just ANY phony.  A phony FOUR.  And it gets WORSE.   I actually thought MAVE was GOOD (obviously).  I had a world-class smirk on my face and was practically STRUTTING towards the computer.  But never mind the phony.  How did I miss the easy bingo?  I ran the alphagram by Eric and Sid and neither of them got it.  When I said make the blank the L, Sid immediately said, "CLEAVER!"  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have missed it had I had CEELRV? instead of ACEERV?  With ACEERV? I just thought of ACERVATE and didn't think there were any playable sevens.   This is a serious blank vision error.

#note Least Favorite Play #1:  Jackie is now the second person this year to get away with a phony seven on me and she's going to be the last.  I really should have challenged this off, but I couldn't pull the trigger.  I was still annoyed by the MAVE* play.  These two  consecutive blunders cost me the game.

#note I missed a cool seven here.  I know the word, but I would probably only see it if the blank needed to be an E or S.

>Tasha: ?CESSUY 5A CaYUSES +82 292
#note I ask myself, "How did I miss CLEAVER - a mid-prob word - yet find CAYUSES - a low prob word?  Because, I answer myself, my blank vision is much worse with lower-probability words.  Words like ANISEED and NUTCASE are hard for me to see through blanks yet I'll see them immediately as naturals.  Lower-prob words are just easier to anagram because they look as if there's only one solution instead of six.  With that being said though, I would have missed this if I had AESSUY? instead.  The upside to my sucky blank vision is that I don't depend on the blanks anyway.  I drew 11 blanks this tournament (to my opponents' 17) and still outbingoed them.  Anyways, Jackie held this play, but doesn't challenge.  In hindsight, CAUSEYS was better defensively.  I also wasn't sure if TEFFS took an S.
