>Joshua_Sokol: AEENRUU H8 UNAU +8 8
#note I need to exchange more often first turn. Also, apparently this placement isn't good.

>Dean_Porporo: DEF 13K FED +31 105

#note I believe this was my leave, but I didn't write it down.
>Dean_Porporo: MNO 10F MO.N +29 134
>Joshua_Sokol: DEELORR 11C ROLE +13 78
#note Maybe RE(SEALING).
>Dean_Porporo: ACINT D7 CATI.N +18 152
>Joshua_Sokol: DENRTUV 8A DEV. +24 102
#note I only saw TRUN(CATION) after DEVA. This is better anyways I think.
>Dean_Porporo: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 152
>Joshua_Sokol: BENRRTU D3 TRUN...... +24 126
#note I really wish he had challenged. He did hold. I knew and saw this word cause I had it available as a disconnected 10 the night before in a casual game vs Kurt Davies.
>Dean_Porporo: EIORSSX O6 XEROSIS +105 257
>Dean_Porporo: EIORSSX --  -105 152
#note What a nice draw after exch 6. I didn't know XEROSIS and I was iffy on SEALINGS.

>Dean_Porporo: EIORSSX 6D .IX +26 178
>Joshua_Sokol: EIINORT -II +0 144
#note Well then, RETINOI(D), we meet again. I know he's luckboxing me but I really deserve to lose this game after these dreadful misses.
>Dean_Porporo: EEIORSS O6 SOIREES +84 262
#note It's at this point I start playing mind games with myself. I need to challenge again. He had other spots though. Ugh.
>Joshua_Sokol: EGNORTW N9 OW +28 172
#note I now want an I back. Why the hell did I exchange ii last turn? :(
>Dean_Porporo: EFIORTU A1 OUTFIRE. +98 360
#note OK then.

>Joshua_Sokol: AADELPT N1 PALATED +81 344
#note Phony. Dean took my score down as 81 but wrote down PLATED. He wasn't paying attention I guess.
>Dean_Porporo: AB O1 AB +28 434
>Joshua_Sokol: ?AIKSVY 4M K.Y +14 358
#note I never know what to do in these situations. I don't think the sim tells the truth, as a sane opponent will block any opening I make with 14B SKY or 14A YAK. Also after M2 KAY, anything that's open will be shut down. I have to create a second lane. It's crazy, but if I had played VI(ES) 6L, I would have drawn SKYJACk next turn. My thought process for this turn was draw the O and another tile and bingo out next turn.
>Dean_Porporo: ?GIIOR L4 ORIGIn +36 470
>Joshua_Sokol: ?ACIJSV 7J JI. +11 369
#note I mistracked, had him with MP, so I tried to block (U)MP. I didn't even look for M2 JA(K)e...
>Dean_Porporo: DM B7 M.D +10 480
#note Yeah, utter failure this game. I needed to see RETINOID and challenge SEALINGS* again.
