>Dave_Koenig: BEEFNUZ 8E FUZE +32 32
#note The correct play here is FUZEE for 10 more points.  This was a memory failure on my part.  I knew FUSEE for sure, but I also knew that one of the hooks on FUSE didn't work on FUZE and got mixed up.  (FUSEL is the one in which the S cannot become Z.)
>Marty_Gabriel: ADENORV H8 .NDEAVOR +89 89
>Dave_Koenig: BBENOSU I3 BUBOES +31 63
#note I burn some good tiles, but I also score well and ensure that the board will be wide open for a while, making it easier to come back from an early deficit.
>Marty_Gabriel: EFILPST 4C SPITEF.L +84 173
#note Well done by Marty.  I'm sure he already had FLEAPITS lined up to the A, but my play gave him a bigger bingo.
>Dave_Koenig: ?EILMNY 11F MY.LINEs +74 137
#note I debated delaying bingoing and making the SPITEFULLY extension, but the game continuation is a good example of why not to do that.  On a wide open board, you might draw a bingo even after bingoing, so better not to sacrifice points.  There are many other bingos that all score the same, but I liked dangling an S in the M column to increase the bingo chances, given that I am still chasing.

>Marty_Gabriel: AGO H1 GOA. +28 238
>Dave_Koenig: EIIKRRS G3 K.IR +27 230
#note No spot for RISKIER, but this nice play scores well and leaves a very balanced, bingo-prone rack.
>Marty_Gabriel: ?DERTUW 14H .UTRoWED +78 316
>Dave_Koenig: AEIORRS C2 RO.ARIES +70 300
#note Marty's bingo took away my higher scoring bingo SAVORIER, but fortunately I still had another.  That's six bingos for the two of us in the first eleven turns, but Marty is still in the driver's seat.
>Marty_Gabriel: OOX 15M OXO +53 369
>Dave_Koenig: AAHJNOV E2 AJ.VA +30 330
#note I believe this is a critical moment in this game.  The high scoring play is HAJ B1, which would probably be the choice of a lot of players, given that it has a balanced vowel-consonant leave in addition to scoring the most.  However, we're getting to a late point in the game where I'm still in striking distance, but I'm almost surely going to need a bingo, or something that scores close to it to come back.  Maximizing the chances of that happening is much more important than scoring a few extra points on this turn.  I have to keep one of the high point tiles after this turn, but the H is a much better bingo tile than the V. There are many T's unseen, so I have a good chance to draw into the synergistic TH combination.  Also, there are many A's remaining unseen, but only one O, so playing off both of them reduces my chance of having duplicate tiles on the next turn.  There are also many good places to score with the H on short plays on the next turn including, F2, F10, 14B, and 14F, so that if I don't draw a bingo I could have a good temporizing play that keeps me within scoring range.  In contrast, if I kept the V, there is a good chance that if I don't bingo, I will have much less flexibility in what I can do to shed it on the next turn.  Finally, this play is better than JAVA 12C, which uses the same tiles but scores 2 more, both because the other one sets up easy scores off the J, but also because it blocks up potential B column bingoes playing parallel to ROSARIES.
>Marty_Gabriel: AGIIT 12B ATIGI +16 385
#note Marty's play looks good.  He seemingly takes out the B column bingo line while turning over many tiles.  He wants to speed to the end of the game in order to minimize the number of turns that I might draw into a bingo.
>Dave_Koenig: DHIINOP 12L DIP +27 357
#note Ironically, Marty's blocking play actually gave me a bingo: the unlikely OPHIDIAN starting at B6.  I missed this opportunity, which could have been a game losing mistake, but I did my best to mix it up by creating the DIPT hook onto the O column.  With all those T's out there, I thought it was likely that Marty would get to it first, but I need to keep as many open lines as possible so that Marty can't shut them all down.  Also, if he plays long on the O column to take out the spot, he may open up an N column bingo for me.
>Marty_Gabriel: CCEENRT O7 RECENT +35 420
#note You can't fault Marty at all here.  It looks like the O column is my most dangerous spot.  Forcing me to bingo to a G, which can't be at the end of a word for an -ING, is the percentage play.  Also, he can't get too stingy with points, as if he did even a nonbingo on the O column with the Q, for instance, might give me enough to catch up.
>Dave_Koenig: AHINNOT 1H .NATHION +98 455
#note I knew that when I drew these tiles I was incredibly lucky, both because my bingo was highly unlikely to be blocked, but also because even if by chance he made a low scoring play to take out the G, I would have had HAINT 14B for 48 points as a backup.
>Marty_Gabriel: ACGLLOQ C14 Q. +11 431
#note Marty had almost no time left and just threw down the Q, but he is losing no matter what.
