>Joey_Mallick: AELNNOX 8D XENON +40 40
>Joshua_Sokol: EINORRT E7 R.ORIENT +66 66
#note I didn't think ORIENTER was good. This is why I need to review high probs. 
>Joey_Mallick: ?ALOSTW 12A WASt.LOT +80 120
#note I think SAL(T)WORT is worth the 6 extra, since it opens two big spots, not just one.
>Joshua_Sokol: ELLOOSV A12 .OVE +30 96
#note Saving the S, not sure if that's right.
>Joey_Mallick: AABDDEL 13H ADDABLE +78 198
#note cool
>Joshua_Sokol: BEHLLOS 9G HOB +26 122
#note Whoa, HELLBO(X). Awesome.
>Joey_Mallick: ACEFMTZ N10 FAC.T +36 234
#note Nice draw. I should have seen FACETE...
>Joshua_Sokol: EILLNPS O7 PLIE +23 145
#note I missed SPLENI(A)L and FACETE.
>Joey_Mallick: EEFMRTZ 15M FEZ +56 290
#note I pay the price.
>Joshua_Sokol: CELNSSU D4 CULE. +30 175
>Joey_Mallick: EEIIMRT 14A .IE +12 302
#note Probably better to score, but this looks fine.
>Joshua_Sokol: AGNORSS 15E SARONGS +83 258
#note At least I saw this, right?
>Joey_Mallick: EIIMRRT 10H RIM +18 320
>Joshua_Sokol: EHIJKUW K9 JEW +32 290
#note I might be able to outscore if he keeps scoring so little and trying to keep the board open. I decide to keep the U for the sake of the Q, but maybe JEU is better.
>Joey_Mallick: AEIIIRT 14J AI +14 334
#note Better if moved over, but this wasn't a very good draw for him. 
>Joshua_Sokol: HIKMNUV 13C HI. +25 315
#note I didn't want to open anything as he's obviously trying to mold a bingo rack together, but maybe I should still play V(U)M and infer no O. I decided to score as much as I could and await for him to give me a spot that I can shut down with the V or something.
>Joey_Mallick: EEIIRTY 14E .YE +29 363
#note He draws a tile he can score with.
>Joshua_Sokol: AMNRSUV F6 VA. +17 332
#note Still trying to avoid a bingo on his part, and it seems to be working thus far.
>Joey_Mallick: EIIQRTT 7M TI. +6 369
#note Awesome that I blocked his Q spot. Knowing he had the Q I guess this play made some sense, but it just gives me a good scoring spot that I will capitalize on most of the time. I think Joey should exchange his Q.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAKMNUY 6L YUK +38 370
#note I decided that this was more defensive (SUT*/SAT) and that I would have Q(U)A and the A(QUA) hook it left me if I drew the Q. I was going to play KAU(R)Y but this looked way too fishy for me to leave alone.
>Joey_Mallick: EIOQRST 5C S.Q +24 393
#note Cool, shutting himself down a bit more and burning his S (I think he has the blank at this point).
>Joshua_Sokol: AADIMNN 5J DAMN +24 394
#note I didn't know AIDMAN, but that was my play I think. I also didn't know DAMAN, but I did know ADMAN. At least this doesn't give him playback.
>Joey_Mallick: ?EIORTT 11I TO. +15 408
#note Probably L8 TORE to score. I'm not going to open a lane for him.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEINPU L11 NU. +17 411
#note This seemed like my best shot, but maybe (J)EU is better. Anything I missed?
>Joey_Mallick: ?EIORTU 9K .EU +11 419
#note (J)O would have been my demise.
>Joshua_Sokol: ADEGGIP L1 DIGA.. +30 441
#note I wasn't very happy with my GG draw, as it kind of said "good game" to me, but I actually could have won. I knew his rack, but I couldn't anagram fast enough to figure out if he had anything with what I opened up. Apparently I can safely play J1 IGGE(D) and 4I GAP to win. Alsop, J2 GID(D)AP, which I didn't know. So I blew this one too...
>Joey_Mallick: ?IORRT 1H sTRI.OR +21 440
>Joey_Mallick:  (PGE) +12 452
#note I made mistakes, but I really felt in control of this game even when behind.
