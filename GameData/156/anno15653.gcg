#note Best.  
>Guy: ?AEIIMT 9G IMItATE +75 75
#note Guy immediately gets to work!
>Brett: ABDNRRU M3 UNBARR.D +74 92
#note We sent back and forth all game...   I bagged him pretty bad earlier in the tourney.  He might have gone 8-0 the 2nd day.  
>Guy: EGHP K7 PH.GE +22 97
#note I had OPENFACE* in mind but I'm glad both spot were blocked.

#note Q really does not like my move here...just trying to clean up my rack and I thought a AELNP leave was not bad...

>Guy: AEG A12 .AGE +24 268
>Brett: AEEKOQT J12 .EK +17 275
#note I was sensing him getting close to a bingo, so trying to take out a lane and have him work by playing an 8.  
>Guy: ?AIRRST 6A TARRIeS +63 331
>Brett: AQ A4 QA. +22 297
>Guy: ELOZ 14F ZE. +32 363
#note He said he was close to playing (G)LOZE but that probably would have proven to be fatal as it doesn't score as much and vowels were drying up.  
>Brett: CEELOST C1 ELECT.OS +72 369
>Guy: LMY 1A YL.M +36 399
#note Not much I could do here and my floating vowel bailed him out from getting stuck with a ton of consonants.  Guy's strength with 4s helped him out.  I do know ylem.   
>Brett: DDHINOO 8A DI.H +36 405
>Guy: DGOTY 2C .OGY +20 419
>Brett: DNOO B1 .OO +26 431
#note Even if I played OO(LOGY) at 2A, a better outplay would have been created and he still would have one.  I'm okay with how I played.  I played most of the best plays.  I probably gave him his biggest scare on the day he went 8-0.  Guy really turned things around.
