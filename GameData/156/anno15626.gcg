#note A play like D(E)VIL just seems like a race to an S bingo, which is very luck-based. I want to avoid making this game luck-based. 

I think I'm being too scared here. 
>Doug_Riblet: UV 5J .UV +14 273
#note I htink his chances of having an S and/or blank go up a fair amount after this.

#note JUTE vs JIVED was a tough decision for me here. JUTE is obviously the equity play, but I feel like he's just going to score a free 33 there. ORU is a shitty leave and JIVED doesn't fully block things, but I think this gives me a better chance at outrunning, and I get one extra shot at a blank.

#note If he has a bingo, I'm screwed anyway. I'm trying to leave one in the bag as a damage control, plus if I draw a bingo-prone rack (which is quite likely with this pool), I can bingo out if he tries a desperate fish. I thought this was a strong play. 

Champ player puts this best, with a 69% win chance. Unfortunately, champ player is nota moron, while I am.

#note For reference, we see the score listed as 369-373. 

This is a colossal fuckup. I see RESWEEP* and RESEWED and can't decide if either is good. I miss SEWERED. Then I decide I don't need to bingo to win. StEWER or ShEWER win from my eyes (we'd end up tying on a recount). REsEES K8 wins. 

I ran my time down to 6 seconds without finding a winning sequence before finally throwing this down. I designated it as a T. If I had made it an H, I would have won. Fuck me. I'm the worst.
