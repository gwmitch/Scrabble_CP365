#note I was pretty close to missing this and playing GEST or EGEST.
>Bill_Kinsella: ADER C3 DEAR +14 43
>Matthew_Larocque: BEFNNOU E6 FOU +19 121
#note Wanted to avoid handing him easy points via the TWS, so kinda rejected all the plays on column B. Sim likes this more than I thought it would.

>Matthew_Larocque: BEEELNN 10I BENE +15 136
>Bill_Kinsella: AOR 11I ORA +20 77
>Bill_Kinsella: AOR --  -20 57
#note Was going to challenge without even a hold, but then had to think to make sure it wasn't just some rarely played word.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEEILNO 12B LE.IONED +60 196
>Bill_Kinsella: IO -  +0 57
#note Challenged.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIKLO K9 E.OKI +18 214
#note Ouch, didn't even come close to thinking about a 2x2. Clears up the vowels too!
>Bill_Kinsella: AIOR 12K .OI +14 71
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEELT 3F DEALATE +65 279
#note More non-S non-blank bingos, my fortune this tournament is unlikely to be repeated any time soon.
>Bill_Kinsella: CC -CC +0 71
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEFIOY M1 CODIFY +50 329
#note Or DEIFY, but amazingly I'm already holding the final E of the game.
>Bill_Kinsella: APX 13A PAX +44 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EGNQRS M11 Q. +11 340
#note Qu(A)G is probably the right play, but this pretty much guarantees a next-turn bingo. Q(I)S is also an option.
>Bill_Kinsella: UUVV -UUVV +0 115
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGNRS 14E NAGgERS +71 411
#note No 3x3 available, and decided that fishing for one was stupid since he'll just block it next turn anyways. N4 SEARiNG scores better and is defensive due to no Es left.
>Bill_Kinsella: RU 1M .UR +15 130
>Matthew_Larocque: RTTUVVW H2 V.V +13 424
#note Playing fast here - put this down before even noticing I could have played it for 17. Lucky I didn't get smacked with za/za, although there is a lesser chance he has something like GL(A)ZY or CR(A)ZY.
>Bill_Kinsella: IO A13 .OI +15 145
>Matthew_Larocque: ARRTTUW B2 WART +22 446
#note Still just slapping down anything that scores - with his next play I have to wonder if some weak play like (R)UT to block is worth it here.
>Bill_Kinsella: ?AGILNS O1 .AiLINGS +77 222
>Matthew_Larocque: CJRTTUZ J1 CZ.R +35 481
#note Well seems I got this part correct.
>Bill_Kinsella: IILMPWY 14A .W +22 244
#note L7 WYL(E) leaving N8 IMPI looks best for him.
>Matthew_Larocque: JTTU 15D JUT +22 503
#note JUTT(Y) goes out, I ought to know that word. Also missed the 33 point J(E)T which kills his next play (he probably doesn't see/know IMPI). Pretty bad. 34 extra spread points for going out - thats a lot of bleeding over the course of several games.
>Bill_Kinsella: IILMPY L2 Y.P +29 273
>Matthew_Larocque: T 3A T.. +4 507
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IILM) +12 519
#note I lost 10, and he was overscored by10. It was a math error on my part, but for some reason it lined up with his version of the score....or not.
