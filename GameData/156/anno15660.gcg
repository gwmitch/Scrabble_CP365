>Morris_Greenberg: DEHNNUY 8H DUNNY +26 26
#note MG: Sidd admitted throughout the tourney how his word knowledge was weak. I thought the 10 points extra was worth the risk of phonying. Hey, I learned a Collins word I guess.
SM: I didn't feel the phoniness on this play, it was the first turn on game 29 :)
>Siddharth_Murali: AEGHINP K3 HEAPI.G +26 26
#note MG: After seeing his rack, I am really surprised he didn't even hold DUNNY.
SM: Because I thought it was good! :p... I kind of autopiloted this but PEH and HEP are obviously better.
>Morris_Greenberg: EGHIISV 3K .IGH +22 48
#note SM: SP agrees with Morris but I'd probably just play VIES. The S isn't quite worth 9 points on this board. I also love H's.
>Siddharth_Murali: ADEEINT H1 DETAINE. +83 109
#note SM: I like the board entropy of this over DETAINED going downwards.
>Morris_Greenberg: CEINSUV N2 C.IVE +30 78
#note MG: Misscored as 28.
SM: VICUNA looks awesome and I might have challenged it too. It opens the board without giving me easy stuff on the triple.
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEIKTT O6 TIKE +26 135
#note SM: I wanted to kill the triple but not provide an easy bingo alley. No play accomplishes this.
>Morris_Greenberg: AIJNOSU L1 JO.N +42 120
>Siddharth_Murali: BEEOOST J5 BOO. +20 155
#note SM: Jeez, I actually knew the bingo... 
>Morris_Greenberg: AAIQSTU G4 AQUA +32 152
#note MG: Much safer for 3 less points. This sims best
SM: I'd try AQUAIST*... no just kidding, AQUA looks great
>Siddharth_Murali: AEEMRST 1A MASTERE. +86 241
#note SM: I was debating between this and STREAMED. At the time I played mastered because I wanted to give him the least possible chance of bingoing on the triple. But if I were to do this over I'd go for streamed because mastered offers too many non-bingo counterplays.
>Morris_Greenberg: CILMOST 2B MOIL +26 178
#note MG: Probably my biggest equity blunder of the game, I missed (A)TOMIC for 6 more points.
SM: I like MOIL here anyways. ATOMIC just kills the board... not that MOIL doesn't, but at least it can be played under, and Morris needs places to score on a board that's otherwise bereft of scoring opportunities.
>Siddharth_Murali: BEIILUW 3A WILE +28 269
#note SM: I like LUBE. The L isn't as useful for score as the W on the triple line even though it offers more bingos, and I also think WII is better than BUI, even if quackle/leave evaluator thinks otherwise.
>Morris_Greenberg: ??CFOST N9 OFfCuTS +88 266
#note MG: Wasn't 100% sure of OFfCaST, I liked that better though but didn't want to risk it.
SM: I held but I didn't think there was much good in challenging.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABIOUUV 15L VI.A +33 302
#note MG: Interesting decision for him here, BIVOUA(C) should be the best though because it scores and cleans up his rack. It win 7.5% more than AVI(S)O and 13.5% more than VI(S)A according to Quackle, even though they shut down the board better. I am pretty sensitive to defensive merits, but BUU or BOUU is too dreadful in such a tight game that even I prefer BIVOUA(C).
SM: I didn't know the word. I like VISA more than AVISO but BIVOUAC is obvious.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEILRRT A3 .ILDER +33 299
#note MG: Sim slightly prefers DIRL and RID so I keep the E, they are basically all equal though. It turns out how things went down, I really needed that E later on. They all sim within 1% of each other.
SM: DIRL looks pretty awesome and I think it's more than 1% better than WILDER. It puts him 7 behind and gives me literally nowhere to score well.
>Siddharth_Murali: ABORSUU 9A SUB +19 321
#note MG: I like ORB 4C, but all plays either score very little or leave Sidd with drek.
SM: Nah, I think I have to split my U's at some point... 
>Morris_Greenberg: AFORRST 4C ARF +24 323
#note MG: I considered a few plays here: ARF 4C, ORT 4C, FARTS D8, and (B)ARF C9. I eliminated (B)ARF the fastest, I really am not desparate in this situation to create the setup. FARTS was gone next, although it scores, it burns a lot of my strong tiles too much. I chose ARF just because it scores better, and I thought sacrificing 6 points for ORT was too much for (SUB)A plays. Sim agrees, ARF finishes 5% higher than anything else.
SM: Agreed.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEGOORU 10C AERUGO +13 334
#note MG: He didn't know (SUB)A it turns out, missing that is huge here. However, I still prefer other plays (even without knowing that). (F)OREGO E4 makes it so hard for me to score on the board that it has to be right here, if he missed that, (F)ORAGE in the same spot is only a bit worse. (F)OREGO wins 10% of the time more than this, and a handful of other plays do better in the sim as well.
SM: Yeah, simple... this scores too little and gives him stuff to work with.
>Morris_Greenberg: ORSTXYZ E4 .OXY +34 357
#note MG: And this is the difficult position of the game. After the game, I really thought S(E)XT D9 was the best play because he could not block both (F)OZY E4 and (O)OZY H11. Sim likes XYST, but Jackson Smylie and I could not figure out why exactly, if I don't land an E I will still be Z stuck after the play most likely. Still the sim likes it 7% more than the next 4 plays, S(E)XY D9, (F)OZY E4, (F)OXY E4, and S(E)XT D9. After not being satisfied, I checked Elise and it came up with an awesome play: (O)RZO H10, which sets up XYST/(O)RZOS the following turn!
SM: Either way, I lucked out in this situation. ORZO would win for MORRIS but his draw after this was just attrocious.
>Siddharth_Murali: AEENNOP 11B PANE +23 357
#note SM: I laid down PANE, picked it up and played PENCE, then switched back to PANE. Both of those are good plays. EON D6 wins a little more.
>Morris_Greenberg: RRSTTWZ L1 ....TS +23 380
>Siddharth_Murali: DELNO 12B ELD +26 383
#note SM: Missed both the outplays.
>Morris_Greenberg: RRTWZ 7C WR. +13 393
>Siddharth_Murali: NO B11 ..ON +12 395
>Siddharth_Murali:  (RTZ) +24 419
