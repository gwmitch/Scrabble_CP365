#note Well, I got away with PAULINE* in a tournament earlier this year against someone rated mid 1100s - so I thought I could get away with it on Ken too. No luck, although the funny part was that he said he didn't think it took an S. Phonies by their nature don't take esses heh :P Oh yeah and valid bingo SPINULAE don't forget Matt.
>Ken_Middleton: OTU 5H .OUT +8 20
>Matthew_Larocque: AEILPSU 6J PIU +23 23
#note At least it's not one of those racks where the best non-bingo option is an 8 point play that leads to bad racks for the rest of the game.
>Ken_Middleton: GO 6F GO. +8 28
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEELOS 7J OE +10 33
>Ken_Middleton: ?AGNNRT F6 .RANTiNG +61 89
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ABELNS 11E S.NgABLE +82 115
#note I wish I could play things like fLEAB(A)N(E)S.
>Ken_Middleton: IKN 13C KIN. +18 107
>Matthew_Larocque: EEEIMRS B8 EMERIES +82 197
#note I was stoked when he actually gave me a line for this to go down.
>Ken_Middleton: FOTU A6 TOFU +40 147
>Matthew_Larocque: DFIJMNQ A13 DIF +35 232
#note I didn't think this would sim well, but it's fine. If only #QIN was TWL!

#note Not sure on my rack, but think I was consonant heavy. Still, the points were too much.
>Ken_Middleton: ADEZ C5 ADZE +30 222
>Matthew_Larocque: HHMNOPW B1 WHOMP +34 330
>Ken_Middleton: EO A1 OE +26 248
>Matthew_Larocque: CEHNRVY D12 V.NY +28 358
#note Forgot CHEVY was a word. NERVY actually equals CHEVY in win %, but I wanted to hang onto my E.
>Ken_Middleton: AERV H11 .RAVE +24 272
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEHRRT N10 TH.RD +26 384
#note Again, I ended up playing this instead of RETCH/CHERT to keep my E. Sim isn't buying it.
>Ken_Middleton: LOWY D2 OWLY +28 300
>Ken_Middleton: LOWY --  -28 272
#note Hilariously, I once played this phony myself and got away with it! Against someone of similar rating to myself!
>Matthew_Larocque: BCCERRS 4F CR.B +12 396
>Ken_Middleton: AILOUWY D2 WAIL +19 291
>Matthew_Larocque: CEERSTX 14H .EX +29 425
#note I had Ken tracked as either YOU or YOD. I scanned the board several times here and I just don't get how I missed seeing all 4 Ds. I think I kept missing the QADI one? Anyways, I missed the outplays for YOU, and made this silly play leaving CREST/THIRDS for next turn. More spread bleeding.
>Ken_Middleton: OUY E8 YOU. +16 307
>Ken_Middleton:  (CERST) +14 321
#note I was overscored by 1, though.
