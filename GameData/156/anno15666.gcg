#note I'm typing this note before I look at any of my games, but I want to say this: I am extremely tired this morning, a mixture of waking up at 7 to drive there and not having a decent breakfast. Still, none of that excuses how bad I'm inevitably going to play. 

What a better way to start of my tounament than with a TEN-POINT blunder. I was going to exchange. Quackle thinks I'm a straight moron for trying to play through this.

#note WELChED, LoC(O)WEED. 

Good lord this is inexcusable.

#note Thankfully, Scrabble is Scrabble and doesn't care how well you play. If you suck, you'll be rewarded with both blanks and 82 points.

>Matt_Canik: AAFIIMR 5G MAFIA +24 161
#note I spent a long time deliberating between this and FAIR/ or MAFIA at 9I. Ultimately, I chose this, which Quackle says is the worst of the options. I was trying to start closing the board, but I should probably just keep running with equity here because of 7, 9, and A beingopen.

#note Kevin said after that this came from 7 consonants. 
>Matt_Canik: ACNNRUW 12A CRAW +36 289
#note Up by a good margin, I think it's important to score points with CRAW instead of playing WAN for 7 less to keep a nicer leave. 
>Kevin_Leeds: IZ 4H ZI. +50 210
>Matt_Canik: LNNOTUU K5 .UNT +13 302
#note I spent a good 6 minutes on this position. I didn't want to play (C)UNT for 5 more because A is really important for me to be able to block, and CUNT makes it impossible for me to block it effectively. 
>Kevin_Leeds: GV M11 V.G +14 224
>Matt_Canik: LNNOTUU A12 .UNT +18 320
#note But now I think I have no choice but to play here. 
>Kevin_Leeds: EIKRS L1 KIERS +39 263
>Matt_Canik: ALNNNOU 2J UN.ON +14 334
#note I really wanted to play NOUNAL/VIGA, but opening up a TWS like that in this position was suicide. UNION sets up my N for 1J, and the only unseen tile that goes there is the M. Liking my odds. 
>Kevin_Leeds: EGOOS 14J GOOSE +28 291
>Matt_Canik: ADHLMNY 15K MY +24 358
#note I was set to play HAM(ZA) for 57 and then balked on its validity. It's just inexusable how bad I am sometimes. 

I chose MY because I've now got the D and the only way I can lose is if he bingos. I'm blocking his only remaining lane, barring something crazy from the T at 15A.

#note (K)HAN for 40 almost has to be right.

>Matt_Canik: AALNOTT 15H ATO.. +33 427
#note I don't see any bingos in the unseen pool. No poing blocking.

>Matt_Canik: AAELNT G2 AL +8 435
#note Kevin's low on time. I'm trying to push him over and blocking RULIE(R)
