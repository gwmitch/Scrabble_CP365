#note Well I missed SURMISED for 85 to win this game for sure. 


In the unseen pool are: DELATED, DERATED, DARTLED, DELEAVE, DELETED, and DEVELED. However, his play implies that he's holding something and fishing for a 1-tile draw into something. He's probably keeping ADDELT or ADDERT or ADEELT or ADEERT. To me, it's still unlikely that he picks up his fish. 

Still I fucked this up so badly. 
>Geoff_Thevenot: ADDELRT 13I DARTLED +77 415
#note He said he actually held ADDELT. 
>Matt_Canik: DEERSSV G1 SERVED +17 401
#note Another cruel instance of "he needs to draw the right thing AND I have to draw the wrong thing". If I don't draw the V last turn, I still win this game. This almost perfectly mirrors my Cree game, where he had to draw into an unlikely bingo and I had to draw the Q, and both happened. 

Still, the blame is all on me for missing SURMISED and generally being terrible.
