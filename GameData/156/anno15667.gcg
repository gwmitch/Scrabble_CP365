#note Learning words is going to be fixed in time. LaNTHO(R)N is the play.

#note I wrote uNLET(T)ED on my scoresheet and came pretty close to playing it, but figured that guaranteed points are better than gambling on a word I'm only fairly sure of, especially when it's only 5 points more. gENTLED is the play in this spot though.

#note No matter what I draw, his rack is going to be awful. I think this leaves be a great shot at going out in 1 with most draws next turn, so I can get a lot of points off his rack.
