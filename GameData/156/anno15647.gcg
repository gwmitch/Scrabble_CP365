>Huguette_Settle: AEINTZ 8D ZEATIN +50 50
#note Deja-vu here - had an opponent open with ZEATIN only a couple months prior. They both asked me if *ZEATINE was a word afterwards as well! 
>Matthew_Larocque: AELORSV H5 VAR.OLES +62 62
#note Saw OV(E)RSALE but wasn't sure it all. Just missed the bingos through the T. My biggest blunder here is blanking on the O hook I'm setting up which makes no sense - it's usually the first thing I think of when I see this word.
>Huguette_Settle: GNOO 12D GOON. +12 62
>Matthew_Larocque: CDEILLO E2 COLLID. +20 82
#note A real groaner of a miss, would have been a sweet play.
>Huguette_Settle: AK 9C KA +22 84
>Matthew_Larocque: EIISWW J5 IWIS +31 113
#note Debatable if the other IWIS for 33 is better, but the KA play looked concerning so I opted to kill the more dangerous S-hook.
>Huguette_Settle: AEP 10C APE +25 109
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEJNRW B10 JAB +57 170
#note That could have been so much worse for her.
>Huguette_Settle: DQU 3C QU.D +28 137
>Matthew_Larocque: EENRSTW 13F WE +14 184
>Huguette_Settle: IMR 11H .MIR +12 149

>Matthew_Larocque: ENOORST M7 ENROOTS +77 283
>Huguette_Settle: COU 8L U.CO +21 196
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIRTT 4B TI +13 296
#note TIT(L)E is a good play I missed. 28 points is a lot.
>Huguette_Settle: IX N10 XI +52 248
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEIRTY 14D DIETARY +82 378
#note Lucky this fit or else I'd be in trouble.
>Huguette_Settle: ?EIORST K1 nORITES +73 321
>Matthew_Larocque: EGNRUUV 2J V.GUE +34 412
#note Ah, right, VOGUER is good but not *VOGUEST.
>Huguette_Settle: ADELP A11 PALED +36 357
>Matthew_Larocque: EFHNNRU 15H HE +32 444
#note Decided that she likely had a high scoring play ready to go here.
>Huguette_Settle: ?AEFGNY O6 AG.NY +22 379
#note She misses/doesn't know VOGUER.
>Matthew_Larocque: FNNRTU 6N F. +13 457
#note I have her tracked as FI?, so I think her best play is ?IF/FA. Silly me. I was just going to play UNF(I)T, but FRU(I)T is better yet!
