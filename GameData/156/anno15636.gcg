>Ben_Settle: FOY 9F FOY +25 25
>Matthew_Larocque: CEIIPUY F9 .UCI +11 37
#note YIPE? I thought *FUCIN was a word for some reason, not that it's relevant because I don't have an N.
>Ben_Settle: ADL J8 LAD +22 47
>Matthew_Larocque: EILNPUY K5 PUNY +36 73
#note Oh, PUNILY is a word. As in most of my endgames this tournament were played punily.
>Ben_Settle: HIN 11D IN.H +18 65
>Matthew_Larocque: CEEFILS C9 FICES +40 113
#note Normally I'd play C11  FICE to set up my S, but Ben seemed like he was trying to balance a strong rack.
>Ben_Settle: ORU K10 OUR +9 74
>Matthew_Larocque: ADELMQT 10B Q. +31 144
#note Almost played Q(U)ALM but the worst case scenario there would be pretty ugly.
>Ben_Settle: PRR 6J P.RR +12 86
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEELMT 12A ME.D +26 170
#note A shame, I was abouit 50/50 on TRAMELED. I was pretty sure on TRAMELS, but thought only TRAMELLED would work.
>Ben_Settle: LOT A12 .OLT +18 104
>Matthew_Larocque: AAELLTT 7H TA +15 185
#note I like TALA(R) or ALTA(R) L2.
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS M2 SNEA.ERS +70 174
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS --  -70 104
#note Ben thought for a long time and then essentially gave up on the game here. The bingo here is RARENESS - I'm not sure if I would have found it either. Otherwise (JO)S(H) seems like a good fish.
>Matthew_Larocque: AELLOTX 12K .ELAX +40 225
#note This was especially good because Ben can't touch it.
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS O11 A.ERS +36 140
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS --  -36 104
#note Ben was under no illusion that I'd actually let this stay.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEELOTT O8 LATE. +36 261
#note Think this was the rack - it was AEELTT and pretty sure O was the last because I was vowel heavy. Missing TOLE(R)ATE and (T)EETOTAL, I never even looked away from the X here.
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS M8 NEAR.ESS +68 172
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS --  -68 104
#note As in his score is now nearless to mine?
>Matthew_Larocque: ABEGOTW D4 TOWAGE +29 290
#note I did fail to see WEB(L)OG and BOW(L)EG, but with his strong rack I'd have to block it anyways if he doesn't. This gets me turnover for blanks and maybe Ben will phony again haha. Oh but I realized right after that I gave him a prime hook. Maybe he'll forget about it?
>Ben_Settle: AEENRSS O8 .....ES +14 118
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEEIIZ 6D .IZ +35 325
#note BEEZER... I didn't even know that word. ZEE(S) to block? Sim with partial rack AERNS doesn't  say much because I'm 99% to win no matter what I play.
>Ben_Settle: AEENNRS 14H ENSNARE. +70 188
>Matthew_Larocque: BEEEIII H13 B.E +15 340
#note Figured something like this would happen after (W)IZ. But I'm not leaving this open regardless of how cruddy EEIII is.
>Ben_Settle: BG 5C G.B +20 208
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIIINT M12 .I.I +8 348
#note Missed the rack clearer NITE(R)IE to hasten the end of the game.
>Ben_Settle: EHIK L2 HIKE. +28 236
>Matthew_Larocque: EEGINRT 3G RETIE.NG +72 420
#note Fluke, and I played this instantly so I never got around to finding the anagram REIGNITE. But he doesn't need free points.
>Ben_Settle: ADDR H1 DR.AD +24 260
>Matthew_Larocque: ??AIMTV 2H .IM +23 443
#note Yikes, no bingos, but I did run my time down to nothing to try and get 500+. I would have fished the V off if it was possible. I could also fish off the M, but the second V was in the bag so yeah.
>Ben_Settle: ANOOOSU 7D .NA +19 279
>Matthew_Larocque: ??ATVV I12 VA. +12 455
#note Forgetting about STOWAGE here.
>Ben_Settle: OOOSU 2L .O +7 286
>Matthew_Larocque: ??TV 15E VoT.s +12 467
#note Impressive, was able to make a double blank play within ~13 seconds. I still lost -20 though. It's all Ben's fault forplaying excessive phonies making the game last longer!
>Matthew_Larocque:  (OOSU) +8 475
