>Joshua_Sokol: DEEFLUW H7 FEW +18 18
#note 0-1 against Morris already this tournament, and I kind of need to beat him here. Unfortunately I start fof really badly. FUELED, FLUED or FEUED are way better here upon further analysis, even though the 3-ply sim likes FEW.
>Morris_Greenberg: FO G7 OF +17 17
>Joshua_Sokol: DEEILOU -LUDEOI +0 18
#note I kind of felt the need to exchange six here because of what happened in my final game against John Scalzo in Albany. I think turnover is important here.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEINST -  +0 17
#note I don't remember what Morris said he had but he said it was an unplayable bingo. He exchanged 1.
>Joshua_Sokol: EIMNRRS 8G ..R +6 24
#note I think I still had to play this.
>Morris_Greenberg: AEIINST J3 ISATINE +66 83
#note This is much better with FERE.
>Joshua_Sokol: DEIMNRS K9 MINDERS +74 98
>Morris_Greenberg: BDEGU 15F DEBUG. +30 113
#note He was probably trying to bait a challenge, which is why he didn't play BUDGES.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BDGHNO K5 HOD +29 127
#note I think HOD K5 is safer than HOB I3. Other options are B(I)NGO, BH(A)NG or BOD K5.
>Morris_Greenberg: OU 12K .UO +8 121
>Joshua_Sokol: ?BEGNNT 3I B.NGE +22 149
#note I missed BaNTENG(S), which I don't think I knew. This is costly.
>Morris_Greenberg: ?AAEIOT 11D AErATIO. +64 185
>Joshua_Sokol: ?GNTTTZ D10 Z.G +26 175
#note Exchanging may be better here.
>Morris_Greenberg: CLNW M10 CL.WN +20 205
#note Morris starts his closing game, cause he can.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?NSTTTU I10 T.T +3 178
#note I don't know why the sim is liking STUNT 13D so much. I think I need to play TUTS 13A.
>Morris_Greenberg: PRSY 13D SPRY +27 232
#note Sure, why not.
>Joshua_Sokol: ?INNSTU 5I N.. +6 184
#note 15M SUN?
>Morris_Greenberg: EEORUV 4D OEUVRE. +27 259
>Joshua_Sokol: ?INOSTU N1 OUSTINg +75 259
#note Too late.
>Morris_Greenberg: AHY 1L AH.Y +33 292
>Joshua_Sokol: AEIPQRV F3 Q.IP +21 280
#note Hoping he doesn't have an E, but he's been drawing what he needs for the entire game. I guess QI M5 may work out to be better in the long-run.
>Morris_Greenberg: DEEILR 2B RELIED +36 328
#note Not one! Two! :P
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEORVX E4 .X +36 316
#note VARA seems to win far more often. I don't know what I was thinking, since I can't draw a bingo with two A's.
>Morris_Greenberg: AJM 1A JAM +42 370
#note Ugh.
>Joshua_Sokol: AAEEORV B1 ..EA +4 320
#note AA N14 is a good play. Not sure it would have worked though. I would need to draw a lucky bingo, and he can still block everything. Not that my play was any better.
