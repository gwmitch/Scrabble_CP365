>Hannelore: IOU -IOU +0 0
>Bill: EOTUVYY -OUVYY +0 0
#note I have to give up 55 points of handicap this game, so no desire to play YOU and start slogging through lousy racks right off the bat.
>Hannelore: AFX 8G FAX +26 26
>Bill: ?EFIRTT H1 TRIFEcT. +92 92
>Hannelore: OW 7H .OW +17 43

>Hannelore: KNST 5G K.NTS +18 61
>Bill: ABCDLOS 9H SOLD +28 146
#note I picked this because I assume I'm the only one who knows the hooks.
>Hannelore: EGO K9 .OGE +12 73
>Bill: ABCEELV 12H BEV.L +26 172
#note CELEB keeps it more closed, but there are a couple lanes still, and I'd rather not have the V.
>Hannelore: IQ 13G QI +25 98
>Bill: ACEEHUY 10K .UCH +17 189
#note I wasn't sure about JIMPY. There are some nice plays up there (the standout being CAYUSE), but at least this closes a lane without really giving anything back.
>Hannelore: BIZ 14H BIZ +41 139
#note This was really a gutshot, as it put her up five with the handicap and I can't block the triple. Too bad for me she didn't play 14F BIZ for four more (which, of course, would be an insane thing to do).
>Bill: AEEHRUY 4J HEY +28 217
#note FEUAR is a nice interior play.
>Hannelore: AINO 15I NAOI +18 157
#note Luckily she didn't have the S, and so the board continues to get shut down.
>Bill: AAEIRUY N10 .AIRY +22 239
#note I'm okay with this. I don't like YAUTIA or YUCA too much. They both score very little and give a lot back. YUCA opens another lane, whereas YAUTIA closes the best lane but provides a TLS hotspot that she could hit while simultaneously creating a new lane. I considered YAUTIA but never looked at YUCA. K2 AYES would be good, but I had already decided that I wasn't confident enough to try JIMPY.
>Hannelore: OW O14 OW +20 177
>Bill: ?AEINTU 1H .UNIcATE +71 310
#note I didn't see EQUITANT, but I was only looking at plays starting from 1H anyway, since I can now totally shut the board down next turn. If there was no handicap EQUITANT would be fine and I'd try to run up the score, but with handicap included this only puts me up by a bingo.
>Hannelore: AV 6F VA. +19 196
#note Good, don't have to worry about MIC or TIC going down there.
>Bill: AEGMNRS 2M MAR +20 330
#note I didn't play GAM or RAM because I was being super careful and felt that there were more words starting EM than ER.
>Hannelore: ADI 3L AID +27 223
>Bill: AEEGLNS 7H ...EL +8 338
#note I felt like there was a chance the triple would stay open for me after this.

>Bill: CEEIL -  +0 399
#note I think this is the first locked game I've played that was mostly confined to one side of an axis rather than a diagonal (well, it wasn't REALLY a locked game since she could've played RESOLD, but close enough).
