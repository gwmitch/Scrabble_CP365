#note She sighed about not having an E, I, or U. I set down my 3 Us face-up on the table and she stopped complaining.

#note Why didn't I play VAN? That's an excellent question!

>Pat_Barrett: OY L7 OY +18 156
>Matt_Canik: EEEEMTV 6J VET +20 163
#note I dunno why she played this and not the more defensive YO for 2 more, but I'm blocking because this smells fishy to me. 
>Pat_Barrett: AAEEIIU -AAEIIU +0 156
#note Guess I should get my sense of smell checked out.

>Matt_Canik: AADEGIR L1 GADI +24 245
#note AARGH I spent a while looking for 6s here and missed GARDAI. I also really didn't like giving up the D here because O10 is likely to become really important, but I just couldn't see anything else worth playing.

#note REJIGGER!?!?!?!

#note REJIGGER IS STILL A WORD!?!?!
>Pat_Barrett: IIUU -IIUU +0 274
>Matt_Canik: AACIIRU O3 ARIA +9 293
#note Points are of the essence right now, so I decided to pass up exchanging to get 9 more of them. 
>Pat_Barrett: ?DIINZ O10 DIaZIN +53 327
>Matt_Canik: CFISTTU 13H IF +22 315
#note DIAZIN looked devastating for a little, but then I realized that 13F is completely unblockable for her, aside from KAFIR. So my goal for this endgame just got really simple: score points to stay close then score 25-30 in that spot at the very end and win.

#note Pat didn't draw after her last play. She made this play with 5 tiles on her rack. Why? I have no idea. She wasn't in time trouble.
