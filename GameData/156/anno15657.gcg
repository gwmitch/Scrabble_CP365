>Darrell_Day: EEY 8F EYE +12 12
>Matt_Canik: DHNOUWY I5 HOWDY +31 31
#note That's strange. I counted HOWDY in both places and got 26 for the stacking placement. It's 34. I'm awful. 
>Darrell_Day: GNORT 5H T.RONG +20 32
>Matt_Canik: AGINNSU F2 GUANIN.S +65 96
>Darrell_Day: AEMOPRS L3 MA.ROPES +80 112
>Matt_Canik: AAENORT M3 AN.ER +29 125
#note This was one f my favorite turns of the tournament because it highlights the fundamental change I'm making to my game right now. Old Matt plays Quackle's highly voatile play of (P)ROA almost immediately. New Matt chooses the play that sims 1.5 points worse to try and pick up more points now and leave less things up to whether he can draw a bingo or not. 
>Darrell_Day: AJRU H1 JURA. +39 151
>Matt_Canik: AEFGOQT N6 FAGOT +36 161
#note I thought about holding the OT off to set up  scoring spot for myself, but EOQT is so bad for that spot. Q likes this by 8 points. 
>Darrell_Day: ITZ E4 ZIT +41 192
>Matt_Canik: AEEIOQV 10J QI. +32 193
#note Darrell, why did you have to make your shitty Z play that blocked VAQ(U)E(R)O? I really needed that spot, now I have to score 16 less and hold AEEOV. 
>Darrell_Day: FO O8 OF +29 221
>Matt_Canik: AEEELOV J2 VEE. +15 208
#note Nice job matt. How could you possibly miss N2 VEE for 5 more? Seriously, how do you do that?
>Darrell_Day: BOT K8 OB.T +20 241
>Matt_Canik: AEIILMO 7C IMI.O +28 236
>Darrell_Day: ??AEIRS 12I vAStIER +69 310
#note AEIRS??. I think my 3-year-old nephew could bingo with that rack. And he can't read. 
>Matt_Canik: AEILLRT O12 .ILL +12 248
#note If I don't open another spot up now, I'm screwed.

>Darrell_Day: ADEILNU E9 UNIDEAL +68 378
#note Or Darrell can just draw ADEILNU after hitting AEIRS?? and I'mm be screwed either way. 
>Matt_Canik: ACCEHRT C2 CATCH.ER +82 330
#note I was about to explode when I drew CCH on my fish, but then realized that that draw was actually quite good...
>Darrell_Day: LX 14D L.X +26 404
>Matt_Canik: DEENSTW M11 W.NE +14 344
#note I really liked this play. Q also suggests W(E)E, which is devastating for him when he doesn't have an A. 
>Darrell_Day: ABDEKUV 15C VA.UED +45 449
#note One of Darrell's two winning plays. The other is VAK(E)E(L) for 42. 
>Matt_Canik: DEIOPST B8 DEPOSIT +87 431
#note So close. 

If I had played VEE instead of VEER, would that have made the difference? Possibly!
