>Matthew_Larocque: AMNOSTU 8D OUTMANS +70 70
#note Huguette has to beat me by around 170 points to win the tournament - so I may have to play more defense than usual. For some reason I didn't play AMOUNTS, but....
>Huguette_Settle: IQ -  +0 0
#note I didn't think she would challenge this!
>Matthew_Larocque: EGINNOV G4 VENO.ING +66 136
#note Even though I wasn't even sure this was a word, if it is good, her winning by 170 will be nearly impossible.
>Huguette_Settle: IQ -  +0 0
#note "WHAT!" she says. She really thought I was throwing a phony down after losing her turn. Because I've done that before haha.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIKMOW E8 .MIAK +22 158
#note (O)OMIAK, WEAKO(N), AWOK(E). This play is meh.
>Huguette_Settle: IQ J6 QI. +32 32
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EEIOUW 12D U.E +14 172
#note I liked this better than WO(K)E, sim likes WO(K)E a little better.
>Huguette_Settle: AEEL 4D LEA.E +18 50
>Matthew_Larocque: ?EIORTW 6A TOWERI.g +64 236
#note Almost gave up, this is the only bingo. Don't ask me why it took that long to consider -ING.
>Huguette_Settle: FLO H1 FLO. +21 71
>Matthew_Larocque: DDFILPW K5 DIF +30 266

>Huguette_Settle: ITZ 13B ZIT +26 109
>Matthew_Larocque: ADINPV 14A VAN +36 329
#note Not sure on final letter, but pretty sure it was a consonant probably an R.
>Huguette_Settle: AEEJ L2 AJEE +25 134
>Matthew_Larocque: BDIPRRS M5 BIRD +14 343
>Huguette_Settle: EX 8M .EX +33 167

>Huguette_Settle: ATT N1 ATT +26 193
>Matthew_Larocque: ABERSSY O1 RYAS +57 430
#note Was sad that she blocked N1 ABYES, but then I saw this which scored even more!
>Huguette_Settle: ?EGLRSU 15C SLUGgER +77 270
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCEHNS 14H BANCHES +88 518
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCEHNS --  -88 430
#note Yeah, no. Getting greedy and stupid. I'll surely hit 500 anyways if I just play normally. I didn't know (E)NCHASE, and I wish I woulda seen C3 SCH(W)A.
>Huguette_Settle: EHP 3C PEH +23 293
>Matthew_Larocque: ABCEHNS 14H BACH +23 453
#note Champ goes with NEB 14H, followed by BH(A)N(G) and BH(UT). This is #4.
>Huguette_Settle: CDO 2B DOC +21 314
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENOOS L10 AEONS +22 475
>Matthew_Larocque: AEENOOS --  -22 453
#note I didn't even count the points for AEONS 15K - obviously getting lazy here. And I knew BACH was some kind of shortened version of BACHELOR so this phony made no sense.
>Huguette_Settle: DINRT 1A DIT +20 334

>Huguette_Settle: NR 11D R.N. +10 344
>Huguette_Settle:  (EO) +4 348
#note She was underscored by 2. I finally win a tournament sans a loss! But I also played opponents that were 500-600 points under my rating so yeah.... call me a paper champion.
