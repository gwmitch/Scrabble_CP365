#note This play sims best, but it might have been too risky. Nick had taken a long time on ARF and I put him on a strong rack. The other choice I was thinking about was OXYGEN, giving up 6 points.

#note Going for the big bluff. If it got challenged, I didn't figure I'd be too much worse off. Actually there was another cool play available, CONCAVITY.

#note Either this or RAGWEED. Down by so much, I preferred to play fewer tiles. And while RAGWEED does create bingo lanes, they're easy to kill.
