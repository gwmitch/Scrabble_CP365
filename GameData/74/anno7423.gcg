>Allan_Simon: LOPTZ 8H PLOTZ +52 52
>Matthew_Larocque: EEIMNOO K5 EMO.ION +36 36
#note For some reason, I was getting way more double doubles than usual in these 3 tournaments. ONETIME also works.
>Allan_Simon: GHU J10 HUG +30 82
>Matthew_Larocque: AADEIOU 4I AUDIO +23 59
#note If only I could clear up racks like this all the time!
>Allan_Simon: UUVV -UUVV +0 82
#note Allan told me he had to clear up his rack too, the "other way".
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEETVW 13I WEAVE +38 97
>Allan_Simon: AIMRTX N10 MATRIX +54 136
#note Now the board's nice and volatile, but I like a game filled with carnage and huge plays.
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEGRST O5 ERGATES +80 177
#note RESTAGE is 1 point more in that spot.
>Allan_Simon: OY 15M O.Y +39 175
#note Phew - no B, F, D, or P to amplify that play.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ACFHIJ I11 JA. +26 203
#note HAJ for 36 is a nice score, but offers an easy 30 back. I like to keep CH together. Dumping the F onto OXY actually ranks pretty high. And CHUFA through AUDIO - didn't know that one.
>Allan_Simon: EIL 9G LEI +12 187
>Matthew_Larocque: ?CCFHIR 10E CHIC +28 231
#note Scored as 27, somehow.
>Allan_Simon: EW 3M WE +20 207
#note Ok, now he's close to a bingo.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?BFNRTV I3 F.B +12 243
#note And I wasn't sure wether to exchange here. The WO play made me wonder if he was trying to set up an IEST bingo. Champ says that my play is terribad, and that exchanging is the only way to go.
>Allan_Simon: AE L12 A.E +12 219
>Matthew_Larocque: ?KNRTTV -KNTV +0 243
#note My lead is going to get demolished if I dont get a playable rack.
>Allan_Simon: AEINNRS E7 NAR.EINS +70 289
#note A new word to me - I'm so awful with 8 letter words.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ELRTUY 13C RU.TY +24 267
#note There is a bingo here, and besides, YURTA offers more points and some letters to bingo through.
>Allan_Simon: BDRU D5 DRUB +19 308
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEFLNT 2K FETAL +26 293
#note Well, this play doesn't even show up on the radar. I figured it scored ok, kept my blank, and offered another area to play a bingo. Best play according to Champ is FL(U) D11.
>Allan_Simon: DIO 5D .IDO +12 320
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ADGIKN 1N KA +31 324
>Allan_Simon: EINST 1H STEIN +26 346
#note Could I have those letters
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DGINOP G9 ..NG. +9 333
#note This is where I fudged up. I didn't have a real plan, except to conserve my P to play at 7C. I didn't want to play it there immediately, because the chance of an outbingo was pretty high. What do I do? Champ player took an awful long time analyzing this. OP/OR/PUN gives me a 36% chance to win. DO/DUN/OBA a 32% chance.
>Allan_Simon: Q E4 Q. +11 357
#note It turns out that blocking this Q play would have won the game - because he wasn't able to use the D12 spot ( I ended up with both blanks along with the only I). I knew I wouldn't have a problem if I did draw the Q, but I never would have guessed I'd be able to Q stick him due the blank being one of the two remaining tiles left.
>Matthew_Larocque: ??DIOOP C7 PODIa +25 358
#note I don't get Quackle sometimes. Champ says this play, among many others, give me 100% chance to win. Although, when I click on an option, it seems to correct itself. It says only the weird bingo and ODOr at 6C give me a win. It actually seems like most plays that deny him the SPUN hook give me a win. Argh. I forgot about REVS when looking at his rack.
>Allan_Simon: ELNRSV B4 REVS +21 378
>Matthew_Larocque: ?O 14H Os +14 372
#note Again, it says that Os or sO(M) give me a win 100%, defying simple math.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (LN) +4 376
#note Close game that I botched because I gave him an S hook for no good reason. Also, we recounted, and actually made a counting error during the recount! Scored FETAL as 24. WTF. Final score 373-378. If I had counted my plays correctly and played RESTAGE for an extra point, I could have added another epic choke 1 point loss under my belt.
