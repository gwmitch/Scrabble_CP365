#note Quackle likes HEAVEN 10G, which I didn't see. Not sure if it's worth opening up a big S hook off one tile fish though.

#note With the S inference, I think opening up another hotspot is ok in order to keep ADEN. Mike might use the line I opened, but he didn't leave any high counters so I shouldn't be too worried. JNANA and JADED are alright too.

>Rafi: ?EENNOU 14H ENOUNcE +70 309
#note To quote Monty Python, "I'm not dead yet!" QADI and ZEDS could get me right back in this thing!
>Mike_Frentz: IKW L12 WI.K +32 379
>Rafi: ACDLOPT M7 COP +33 342
#note According to Quackle, COPAL is better. I considered it, but played COP because I figured the ENOUNCED spot would likely be blocked and I wanted a chance to bingo elsewhere or have one last fish. Maybe COPAL is better because I have more shots at ZEDS/QADI, but I do have to ditch the A to do it.
>Mike_Frentz: WY 2G Y.W +14 393
>Rafi: ADEEILT 9C E. +3 345
#note Time to get a little crazy! I have to hope Mike doesn't have the S, which seems plausible considering he may have been able to block QADI with it. If I draw the S I get DETAILS, but what I need is to draw the Q and leave the S in the bag, and hope that Mike blocks my fake setup.

#note SCORE! But it's not quite over yet...
>Mike_Frentz: ACEOSUZ J7 COU.E +8 408
#note Blocking my outplays and leaving ZAS in two spots. Looks like a winner, except for one small detail.
>Rafi: EILT 13A LI. +5 430
#note Blocking ZAS for 40.
>Mike_Frentz: ASZ 12H ZAS +31 439
>Mike_Frentz: ASZ --  -31 408
#note If COUDES is good, Mike wins - which is what he was hoping. What an insane game!
