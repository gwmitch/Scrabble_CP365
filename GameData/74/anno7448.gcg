#note Kibitzer likes VAWS, but I have a feeling it would not sim as well.  The board is too blocked up to be able to count on getting a bingo down quickly after that.

#note HOODIE looks like a decent choice too, though it obviously gives a lot back on row 1.

#note It may look crazy to open up a triple-triple after the last play, but I decided it was not time to play scared.  This was both my highest scoring play and best rack cleaner. There were so many open bingo lines that playing defense didn't make any sense.  Once in a while I'll get hammered by the nine-timer, but I'm more likely to lose by having him make a normal bingo and then not being able to keep up in the race because I haven't taken care of my rack.  Plus, it's not bad for several triples to be open so that I can have some good scoring plays after the bingo goes down.
