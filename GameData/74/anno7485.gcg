#note IT BEGINS.
>Me: AFORSSV E4 FAVORS +33 51
#note -1. it prefers it at 10C even though it scores less. it gives less back to the opp (don't open hotspots foolishly when down) and it gives me more if i go at 10C.

>Me: EGNNQRT 3M GEN +16 301
#note when my chances of winning are so low i decide to try for something lucky. what i was thinking here was D11 TRANQ for 50 and then drawing a bingo. quackle thinks that exch GNQR gives me the best chances of winning though; i am bad at quantifying miniscule probabilities like that. - 2.25%
