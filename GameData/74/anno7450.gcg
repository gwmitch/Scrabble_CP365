>Matthew_Larocque: AEELNRS 8D LEANERS +66 66
#note Round 5 of WCSC early bird 1.

I still don't get how to place a bingo optimally on the opening turn. Does the E make double doubles too easy or something?
>Betty_Bergeron: ACDDEI J2 CADDIE. +19 19
#note CADDIE/CLEANERS
>Matthew_Larocque: AAILMNR E5 MIN.RAL +36 102
#note Guess that answers my first question. There's a bingo through the A, though.
>Betty_Bergeron: INOY F10 YONI +30 49
#note She probably doesn't know YONIC, so I'm hoping to draw the C if it's available.
>Matthew_Larocque: ABFILWY F3 WAIF +35 137
#note I wasn't sure what was best here, but Champ agrees with me.
>Betty_Bergeron: LOP 3C PLO. +18 67
>Matthew_Larocque: BFILORY 4H BO.ILY +30 167
#note I should have forced myself to find this bingo.
>Betty_Bergeron: DIR H1 DRI. +21 88
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGIQRU M1 QUE. +32 199
#note I really hated doing this, but Champ has it second only to F(R)IG at 7I. 
>Betty_Bergeron: EINOSTT 14A TONIEST +78 166
>Matthew_Larocque: AEFGIMR A9 FRIGA.E +39 238
#note ugh, FAQIR. It would also block her next play.
>Betty_Bergeron: AAU 1L A.UA +42 208
>Matthew_Larocque: ?IMOPTU 15G OPTImUM +85 323
#note I first saw OPIUM before seeing this -  high point bingo, and nearly missed it.
>Betty_Bergeron: CEHO C7 ECHO +24 232
#note She counted 23 on this play.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?HKRRTT 2L H.T +21 344
#note Not very good. R(U)TH scores more and gets rid of an R.
>Betty_Bergeron: BE 14J BE +21 253
>Matthew_Larocque: ?JKRRST H7 J.RK +15 359
#note Normally I hate tossing high point letters on the board for minimal points, but it unclogs my rack and sets up my S. Champ doesn't really like it - likes KR(I)S for 18. I know I have a blank, but that still seems like a waste, and am I supposed to be keeping the J for a big play starting at I13? Or just a J bingo?

I figured RST? should give me a bingo if I draw a vowel or two.
>Betty_Bergeron: ENZ D12 ZE.N +28 281
>Matthew_Larocque: ?ERSTVV 6I V.VE +10 369
#note Ok, so I should study double V bingos! Playing off the blank now for 49 points using VERVES/VARVES/VIVERS provides a slightly higher win %, but were talking 99.9 vs 99.8.
>Betty_Bergeron: ADEGGSW 11H SWAGGED +92 373
#note So, as far as I knew, swag was stolen treasure. But it also means to sway. I wisely stayed put, especially since I saw I had an outbingo anyways.
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AORSTU N8 OUT.AReS +81 450
#note Hey, I made two eights on the same turn - perhaps a first.
>Matthew_Larocque:  (ENOTX) +24 474
#note I  seemed to draw really well against Betty, having scores of 474, 475, and 478 against her in the two tournaments.
