#note A case can be made for 6H WIZ, although I prefer to keep my racks as friendly as possible in this situation (which means I'd rather not keep 3 vowels to and only 1 consonant). In my experience, it's very rare for someone to come back from an early deficit as long as I keep flexible racks; the typical comeback involves my getting drek and stalling, so I'd rather be proactive and really emphasize solid leaves in this situation, especially if I'm a heavy favorite anyway. Another way of putting it is that I don't really need the extra points WIZ offers, at least not as much as I need rack flexibility. The computer sim has my play in a statistical dead heat with WIZ and B4 WIZE(N).

#note Really interesting spot. I've got a very bingo-prone rack, but no way to shed the A for a decent score. Computer sim favors plays like 6D A(W) and 3C AA. In cases like this I prefer to err on the side of continuing to score, even though 16 points is still pretty meager. Most intermediate players fish for bingos way too much, so I've become pretty averse to it, although in this case it's probably right to do so.

#note I've never encountered a situation where passing is best against a human opponent (there was a famous game where an expert passed against his computer opponent in a Human vs. Computer tournament where all the players played two rounds against computer opponents and the rest against other people. The expert knew that the computer would not make any inferences from his pass, and in fact the pass was the brilliant winning play with only a few tiles in the bag. That said, you're probably overthinking it if you are ever tempted to pass. An interesting alternative is the intentional phony, which accomplishes the same thing when your opponent challenges it off, except that he thinks you've just made a big mistake when in fact you're just hoping for him to open something up. I've made such a play a few times, but the situation has to be just right.

#note The computer's preferred plays (like the obvious 3A JAW, which gives you a very open lane for a wide variety of sevens) all open up too much given your pass, so I think it's right to play defensively like I did.

#note I was hoping you'd give me a spot for WISEACRE, but no such luck. The computer sim prefers keeping amore bingo-prone rack with F5 WE, but my play is a reaonable (although more volatile because of the big opening I'm creating for plays along row 2) alternative.

#note The only bingo.
>seth: ERX 14A REX +33 118
>moh: EILORTV 2C OVERLIT +68 327
#note Yes, sometimes I can be a lucky son of a bitch and bingo on a redraw. It's better to play the same word from 12H.
>seth: CEM H1 M.CE +27 145
>moh: BINQRTU 12A QI +24 351
#note Or 4G R(E)QUIN. Nothing else is close.
>seth: AEIOSSU H11 AU.IO +21 166
#note Probably best with the stellar 0.02% chance to win!
>moh: BNRTUUY I9 BUY +16 367
#note It's nearly obligatory to shed a U and the Y, although there were a couple of better places (I5 BUY, I4 RUBY, and 7A BUY). 
>seth: DEOS J8 DOSE +21 187

#note Best.
>seth: BOS K11 SOB +24 211
>moh: ?GHKTTU I4 THUG +21 412
#note Close, but it's better to play I4 THUG 21.
>seth: ANR L12 RAN +14 225
#note Risky...
>moh: ?ADFKTT 15L KhAF +58 470
#note I wish I'd seen the cool 15J DiKTAT, which scores the same in points but way more in coolness.
>seth: EHOS M10 HOES +27 252
>moh: DLMNRTT G12 M.LT +14 484
#note N7 D(E)RM or T(E)RM are better. Duh.

#note Notice that I've broken 500. I undercounted a couple of plays, which I'll attribute to playing two at a time. Funny since I joked about a recount in order to try to break 500 for the stats.
