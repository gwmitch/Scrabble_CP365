>Wayne_Clifford: EHNRY 8D HENRY +30 30
#note WCSC early bird 1, round 1.
>Matthew_Larocque: DEGHNRU E4 HUNG.RED +102 102
#note Lucky he played an e for me, and in the perfect spot.
>Wayne_Clifford: EIL F10 LEI +12 42
>Matthew_Larocque: AMOSTTU G2 OUTSMA.T +63 165
#note Again, a very fluky draw to make an 8 through that R. 
>Wayne_Clifford: EIL D2 LIE +16 58
#note Looks like Wayne has a few too many duplicates

>Wayne_Clifford: IN C13 IN +10 76
#note He sure is fishing a lot, and it doesn't seem to be paying off....
>Matthew_Larocque: ALRUVXZ 2F Z..A +33 243
#note Creating a hook like this could be dangerous, but I like to create openings when my opponents are stuck in a fishing cycle. It could cause them to play off tiles they were attempting to save.
>Wayne_Clifford: GO 9G .OG +11 87
>Matthew_Larocque: ILRUVWX J2 LUV +24 267
#note Normally I'd be happy to dump VU for any amount of points, so this worked out pretty good.
>Wayne_Clifford: ACDEINR J8 CAIRNED +71 158
#note Finally got one.... but 5 turns of fishing completely negates it, really.
>Matthew_Larocque: ACIRTWX 13I X.RIC +44 311
#note Played this pretty quickly, never even noticed W(A)X up by ZONAL.
>Wayne_Clifford: BKOS 15A BOSK +48 206
>Matthew_Larocque: ADEFSTW 12H WA.ES +39 350
#note I felt like the extra points here was completely worth using my S.
>Wayne_Clifford: AEGP 14F PAGE. +25 231
>Matthew_Larocque: ?DEEFRT B7 FRETtED +67 417
#note I had a tough time with this rack  - suprisingly, there are only 3 bingos, 2 of them being playable here.
>Wayne_Clifford: ILO 4J .IOL +14 245
#note Although opening like this is the only realistic option, I almost felt bad with what I was able to play next....
>Matthew_Larocque: AEJMOUY A6 JOEY +58 475
>Wayne_Clifford: OT 15G TO +17 262
>Matthew_Larocque: AEEIMTU N3 EAU +11 486
#note I'm not sure what he had, but figured this would make it a lot more akward for him to bingo either way.... I basically didn't see any of the words playable through the L.
>Wayne_Clifford: ?AORV 8J .AVORt +42 304
#note This was incorrectly scored as 45, which I didn't notice until now.
>Matthew_Larocque: EIIIMPT 1B IMPI +20 506
#note Man, tempi sure would have been nice. 
>Wayne_Clifford: AFSTW O1 FATS +36 340
>Matthew_Larocque: EIT 6G .ITE +8 514
>Matthew_Larocque:  (W) +8 522
#note It's always great to start off a tournament with a high scoring game, but I ended up finishing 4-4, which is basically par for the course for me. It's also only one of two 500 games I achieved in 37 rounds of Scrabble - I guess tougher opponents does that.
