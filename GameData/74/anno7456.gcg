>Jim_Nanavati: ALOVV 8D VOLVA +30 30
>Winter: DIMNPTU 9H DUMP +13 13
#note Low-prob tiles that I haven't anagrammed deep enough to work with.
>Jim_Nanavati: AKY 10J YAK +37 67
>Winter: AHINPRT 11K HIP +38 51
#note And now high-prob tiles that scream bingo, causing me to burn a lot more time.
>Jim_Nanavati: AINO 12L NAOI +28 95
>Winter: AALNRTY 13K LAY +36 87
#note Another rack that screamed bingo, but this one was way beyond my knowledge. More time burned.
>Jim_Nanavati: IQ 14J QI +33 128
>Winter: AGNNRRT O8 TARR.NG +24 111
#note Finally have to burn the high-prob leave in order to score.
>Jim_Nanavati: AHJ 7H HAJ +21 149
>Winter: EILNNOO 15G ELOIN +29 140
#note Really thought there was something better than ELOIN, but I had burned so much time with those early racks I just had to play something quick.
>Jim_Nanavati: AEEEGRT F6 RE.EGATE +65 214
#note There's the Es!!!
>Winter: ?NNOSSU 13A NONUS.rS +64 204
#note Another hard rack that burns a lot of time looking for the best play. I even saw UNSONSy too, but not the hook.
>Jim_Nanavati: DEX 12B DEX +45 259
>Winter: ADEEEOU 14F DEE +28 232
#note Again, played too fast because I'm low on time (no thanks to Jim's racks, which seem to have come really easy).
>Jim_Nanavati: CRRU I3 CRUR. +10 269
#note Finally some hope for me, unless he has the blank, which I have to consider.
>Winter: AEIMORU 4H U.EMIA +18 250
#note Missed the good play, and no seeing anything really good, decided to kill those lines. Given that Jim played for 10 instead of exchanging, I'm suspecting a good leave or the blank on his rack.
>Jim_Nanavati: FGI 3M FIG +24 293
>Winter: BDLNOOR O1 BO. +18 268
#note No idea what to do, and not much time to think about it.

#note Dammit Jim stop scoring!!!
>Winter: DFLNORT 5K OFT +31 299
>Jim_Nanavati: CEIT E3 CITE +14 333
#note HE HAS THE BLANK!!!
>Winter: DILNRWZ 4D W.Z +30 329
