#note UNSEX is probably better.

#note Jeff would soon regret not playing QUE(R)Y, which he nearly did.

>Jason: IORSVWY 15A IVORY +44 246
#note Obviously I felt really good at this point.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ADEIOUZ 15G DIAZO +49 173
>Jason: DNSTUVW 14K WUD +12 258
#note A bunch of options. STUD or STUN at K8 does good things for the board given my lead. Exchanging may be preferred, too.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AEIIRSU E4 AUREI +21 194
>Jason: FHNSTVW 4D F.WN +20 278
#note Thanks for the open vowels, Jeff!
>Jeff_Fiszbein: AADEILS 3C AI +9 203
#note "What would Chuck do?" Jeff asked at one point while considering this rack. "I'm so tired of hearing 'What would Chuck do?'" I said. "Is Chuck 1900? Is Chuck number one in Michigan? Ask me!" :) Jeff correctly pointed out that my advice may be biased. Josh Kopczak was amused by it all.
>Jason: EGHOSTV H1 HOGS +39 317
#note GHOST is better. T's are cheap now.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?ADELMS L6 SAMpLED +79 282
>Jason: ACENOTV 11B CO.A +24 341
#note CP says MOVE is a clear favorite. Should've made it. VENT is too dangerous a leave with EEEENNNTTTT making up 11/24ths of the unseen pool. I just didn't want to give Jeff more openings.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ILNOPRT 15M OPT +18 300
#note On the other hand, MOVE would've given Jeff T(E)RPINOL, although he said he's not sure he'd have found it.
>Jason: EENNTTV O12 VEN. +11 352
#note Sure enough, I pull the most probable three-tile draw (ENT) and am screwed. Maybe I should play EV(E)NT now and concede the bingo, make him empty on the number.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: EILMNRS B1 MERLINS +75 375
>Jason: AEFJNTT 2F JE.N +27 379
#note Since I had to keep the margin of defeat within 67 to finish ahead of Jeff if I lost and we each went to 4-3, I couldn't make either of the potential winning plays (FA(W)N at F2 or EF at A1) and decided to block what I could while giving myself a chance should Jeff mess up. This seems to be the best spread play.
>Jeff_Fiszbein: ?EINOTT 1A E.IT +21 396
#note Nice comeback by Jeff in this game, nice job by him to go from 0-3 to 4-3.
