#note Mitch didn't give me an R, but he still helped me out immensely with this play...
>Winter: ACENSTU G2 CUNEAT.S +63 63
>Winter: ACENSTU --  -63 0
#note This rack drives me crazy. I have missed it SOOOO MANY times, and today was no different. I knew CUNEAT(E)S* was phony, but it seemed more plausible than UNCASTE(D)*.
>Mitchell_Brook: ANW D8 .AWN +9 37
#note Here's where it got qwaaazy! Because MAYED had not given me hook, Mitch assumed I had seen NUTCASE and was phonying intentionally to get a hook, and he struggled to find a play that didn't give me one. He struggled FOR OVER 10 MINUTES!!! By the time he played, his clock was close to hitting 10 min!!!
>Winter: ACENSTU H1 UNCASTE. +86 86
#note Mitch had been coffeehousing about how every play gave me the bingo, so I knew I had something. I also knew it didn't begin with A or E, or NA, or NE, or TE, or SE, but I still couldn't see it. So I quickly threw down a play hoping that if it got challenged, Mitch would burn yet more time avoiding giving me the hook.
>Mitchell_Brook: EIM 6F MI.E +12 49
>Winter: ?BDJQRU 4D BURQ. +32 118
#note Mitch is down to less than 7 minutes now.
>Mitchell_Brook: AII 11C I.IA +8 57
#note Mitch was cleary hurting.
>Winter: ?DDIJSV 2E DJI. +28 146
#note I had seen the DIS extension earlier, but I forgot it in my hurry to play quickly and push Mitch over time. But once again I caught a break, because I blocked Mitch's bingo.
>Mitchell_Brook: EG F10 G.E +8 65
>Winter: ?DEPSVV -PVV +0 146
#note Considered D(E)V to block the bingo that Mitch had telegraphed, but if he hooked MITE than I'd have P and V on my rack and probably not bingo.
>Mitchell_Brook: AELNOST 13B TOLANES +71 136
#note Guess I should have blocked.
>Winter: ?DEEEOS H13 .EE +9 155
#note Yeah, blocking wouldn't have been worse than drawing into this crap.
>Mitchell_Brook: ?AEIKPR J4 PARKIEs +73 209
>Mitchell_Brook: ?AEIKPR --  -73 136
#note Insta-challenge.
>Winter: ?DEEOST J5 EScOTED +70 225
#note Again, played instantly to keep pushing Mitch's clock (now approaching 4 minutes). Didn't look for anything better.
>Mitchell_Brook: ?AEIKPR 15A PEARlIK. +92 228
#note I was extremely dubious of this, butt Mitch was now under 4 minutes with 40 tiles in the bag. With my play I'd be up, and I was sure I could beat him on time on a relatively closed board.
>Winter: AACHIRV K2 RICH +28 253
>Mitchell_Brook: BFOR K10 FORB +29 257
>Winter: AAGIOUV 14B OVA +27 280
#note ,Damn, not even looking at that spot. Actually not even looking at the whole board b/c I was playing too quickly.
>Mitchell_Brook: HINT 5B THIN +22 279
>Winter: AFGIOUX J1 FOX +28 308
#note AARRGHH!!! STILL MISSING THAT SPOT!!!
>Mitchell_Brook: NV 9C V.N +12 291
>Winter: ADGILRU I10 DUG +16 324
>Mitchell_Brook: LUZ B3 LU.Z +33 324
#note That's fine--Mitch is definitely going over time.	
>Winter: AGILRTW C5 .AW +24 348
#note This play pushes Mitch over time.
>Mitchell_Brook: OO 4K .OO +10 334
#note At this point, with Mitch over time, I finally consolidate my tracking and realize that I could be in trouble.
>Winter: GILRRTY M3 L.G +8 356
#note A bingo seems like a slam dunk, so I have to drop that G to make it as difficult as possible. I see G(O)RILY of course, but the chances that will give him a hook are TOO GREAT!!!
>Mitchell_Brook: E 12K .E +4 338
>Winter: ILPRRTY 10I ...TLY +21 377
#note Man this looked bad. I spent a long time looking for the obvious block without realizing he had two spots. Only the fact that I realized my leave from PITY, RLL, didn't give me any good playing options, prompted me to look again, and that's when I saw the winning play. I did see TRIPLY, but I wasn't sure, so I couldn't risk it.
