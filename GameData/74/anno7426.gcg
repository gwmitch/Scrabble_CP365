>Ron_Weasley: ?ACERTU 3B RETiCU.A +72 92
>Harry_Potter: AEINRTX 4C TAR +30 115
#note Thought about PAX but this spot has potential to be painful if left open.
>Ron_Weasley: AGZ 2A ZAG +34 126
>Harry_Potter: BEEINXY 2H .YX +36 151
>Ron_Weasley: ADNR 1I RAND +22 148

#note For the love of Pete.
>Harry_Potter: BBEEENV K11 EBB +20 179
#note Did not see BEE(HI)VE which is the play.  Deal with the B's before the V.
>Ron_Weasley: FFO I11 OFF +17 226
>Harry_Potter: EEINRVW H11 NIEVE +43 222
#note Was all set for ENVIER or L9 REVIEW before OFF came down.  This'll do.

>Ron_Weasley: AIINRST 15F IN.RTIAS +74 328
#note Jiminy Christmas!!!
>Harry_Potter: AEGLPUW B11 GAWP +34 313
#note Crikey.  I didn't see 14F PAVE here.  That leaves 1 in the bag but also WU.  GAWP empties on the number, but also clears the junk from the rack and opens a lane that could be useful, holding the case E, if I draw right...
>Ron_Weasley: ?KORSSY A8 KYRe +33 361
>Ron_Weasley: ?KORSSY --  -33 328
#note At this point, I think every play that goes out in two wins.  
>Harry_Potter: CELOOSU 14E CLO.E +29 342
#note At this point, there are zero plays that guarantee a win.  CLOVE leaves only one winning play for Ron.  Anything that doesn't block YOK is probably doomed to fail.
>Ron_Weasley: ?KORSSY M1 YeRKS +31 359
#note Can you find the play that wins?
>Harry_Potter: OSU 15B SOU +15 357
#note 8J EuROKY wins by six.
