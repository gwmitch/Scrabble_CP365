>Jeff: ?RSSUWY 8D WUSSY +30 30
#note WUSSY wins the sim!
>Them: AEMNNTU 7H MUN +13 13
#note Q likes 7E NEUM best, followed by D4 UNME(W), both score over 20. you get 4th with MUN, though
>Jeff: ?APQRRS -PQR +0 30
#note Q likes keeping APRS? best, which makes sense now that I see it. I'm really surprised by the 3rd and 4th choice, which burn the blank on Qi(S) or (S)uQ.
>Them: ACW 9H CAW +19 32
>Jeff: ?AAARSX 7D AX +23 53
#note F8 (S)AX uses the same tiles for 3 more points.
>Them: DDEHHNP -  +0 32
>Jeff: ?AADRSU C1 DAtURAS +77 130
>Them: AELNOOT 10I LOO +14 46
#note Q likes your move best for leave (or NOO in same spot), with 1B O(D)ONATE close behind for score.
>Jeff: EINNRST 11C TINNERS +67 197
#note I looked for an underlap but somehow missed 11G INTERNS. TINNERS at L8 would have scored 3 more.
>Them: EH B5 EH +28 74
>Jeff: CEILMNR L8 LIMNER +24 221
#note I lose points for not knowing 1C (D)ERMIC, but should have found M(A)LICE, M(A)NIC, or ME(D)IC, which all score more. MALIC is also good.
>Them: AEJNOTZ B2 ZA +45 119
#note a close match between your play, and interestingly, 6B (HA)J for 26.
>Jeff: ACEIOTU A6 ACUTE +27 248
>Them: EJNOPTV 12A JEON +44 163
#note C9 JE(T)TON is neat play that doesn't set me up with the J above the TWS, even though that never got used.
>Jeff: FILOOOP M6 POOF +25 273
#note Would you believe I missed a bingo from this rack? Through the R. Time for a new flashcard! I also missed a better overlap over the -INNE- in tinners.
>Them: HPRTTV 6M .HT +16 179
#note Q really likes the HPRT leave from V(E)T, maybe because there are a lot of vowels unseen? (LO)TH also scores highest. Of course, having 7 tiles would have helped, too. :)
>Jeff: ?DEILNO O2 DELa.ION +77 350
#note Phew! I didn't miss any 3x3's.
>Them: FOT 13A OFT +32 211
>Jeff: ADEGIQR N1 QI +28 378
#note I saw the MUN(I) hook all game until I needed to use it. I like my leave better though.
>Them: GIIV 4K VIGI. +18 229
>Jeff: ABDEEGR 13J BA.GED +20 398
#note (D)REDGE, (D)EGRADE, (D)EBEARD. oops.
>Them: AEEIPRT 14E PEATIER +71 300
>Jeff: BEGIRTY D2 GET +27 425
#note Oops again, I was looking for JO__ words but then forgot to. Missed (JO)EY. Didn't know BEIGY, which is pretty cool.
>Them: AEEIKLO 15D KALIO +56 356
#note (JO)KE would have been best if not for your phony.
>Jeff: BDIRRVY 15K BIRDY +41 466
#note Little did I know I was phonying back at you- BIRDY isn't good! I saw BI(D)DY but wasn't sure, and DI(V)VY if you took my spot.
