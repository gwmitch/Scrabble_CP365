>Matthew_Larocque: ?CHILOT 8H CLOTH +28 28
#note WCSC early bird 1, round 2. Three bingos here, the only one I recognize is Trochil. But finding words in a game is another story...
>Huguette_Settle: CEINORT K5 CON.RITE +90 90
#note Ouchies
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AABDIN J10 BAD +27 55
#note Yeah yeah, BAD describes this play. This is because I don't study... much. I chuckled at the thought of playing BANDAID, though.
>Huguette_Settle: ?AELOTU H8 .OpULATE +80 170
#note My turn to get blown out, heh..
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAIJNP 14H .AJ +26 81
#note Right away I thought of JAPANNING, except I didn't realize it required doubled Ns. There's a perfectly good JAPANIZ(E) though. :(
>Huguette_Settle: DENV M7 VEND +24 194
#note Yeah yeah, protect that lead...
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEINP 12A PErENIA. +74 155
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEEINP --  -74 81
#note I had the right idea, I just fail at spelling. I must not have had enough "patience" to see the common word bingo availible. Or enough bizzare word knowledge to draw a challenge by playing PEACENIK.
>Huguette_Settle: AH J6 HA. +29 223

>Matthew_Larocque: ?AAINTY M13 ANY +29 140
>Huguette_Settle: AGRU 12D RUGA. +12 252
#note Definitely shouldn't open when you know your opponent has a blank....
>Matthew_Larocque: ?AEGITW D8 WATE.InG +67 207
>Huguette_Settle: DNOR 8A DRO.N +27 279

#note LOL. 
>Huguette_Settle: Y C8 .Y +18 297
>Matthew_Larocque: EFNOUWX N13 XU +34 241
#note The sim results put OWE for 24 in the same spot as the best play. Yeah, that spot will get blocked, and my rack is not bingo material anyways. I think I want to grab 30-something for the X right now. But playing it at the WATERING spot would have been far better, in hindsight.
>Huguette_Settle: LO 9G L.O +8 305
#note I'm not even sure what this play means... fishing for another bingo?
>Matthew_Larocque: EFGNOSW 7B OF +24 265
#note Crap, GONEF.
>Huguette_Settle: AKLP E5 PLA.K +32 337
>Matthew_Larocque: EGNORSW I3 GROW +19 284
#note I have to get a bingo ASAP.
>Huguette_Settle: DEIM 15A MID.E +27 364
>Matthew_Larocque: EIINQSS B14 Q. +22 306
#note No no, get out of here stupid Q!
>Huguette_Settle: ESZ 10A ZES. +25 389
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINSS 10A ....S +26 332
#note I didn't really have much in the way of time.... BINDI gives me another spot at least, and dumps an I.
>Huguette_Settle: UV F12 .UV +15 404
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIINS -  +0 332
#note I exchanged II here, but apparantly there were only 5 letters in the bag? Whoops.
>Huguette_Settle: EE A10 .EE +13 417
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIINS 6E .I +4 336
#note didn't record this rack - but playing off an I here means I had at least 2.
>Huguette_Settle: FI 6A IF +27 444
>Matthew_Larocque: AEIIMNS 3C SEAMIN. +22 358
#note Imagine if I had found that play....
>Huguette_Settle: EIIRSTT H1 TI.ES +23 467
>Matthew_Larocque: I F3 .I +4 362
#note BINDI
>Matthew_Larocque:  (IRT) +6 368
#note And minus 20 on the clock for me, causing me to lose by over 100 this game.
