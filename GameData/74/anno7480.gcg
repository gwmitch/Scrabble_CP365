#note pretty lame, milhouse. i wasn't very sure of this, but i thought i could probably get a way with it. wrong! just play TAV.  -44.5

#note i did not like anything. i saw RETAG at 7E but i guess i completely misevaluated it since it sims a lot better than what i did. i like playing more open. -9.5

#note yuck i guess. i don't know what to play here. D1 ALAR is funny, no thanks. 6E WAT, K3 TAV, maybe? -3

#note ok here is where it gets interesting. i am sorta amazed that BEAU sims best with his full rack as inference; i guess i thought about it correctly! (still i wonder if there can be an improvement made to the inference engine; how much worse would this sim if he had a chance of picking SUQ instead of COQUET?)
>robin: ?EEOQST F12 S.Q +32 238
#note i guess coquet is a little better than suq!
>Me: AIINOST G13 TI +22 239
#note i guess i really screwed this one up. maybe i'm like hoping he'll mess up. 3F AIT sims best, keeping the best chances of bingoing. TI keeps a bad leave and gives a lot back. dumb. -10

>robin: EM 13I EM +15 324
>Me: BEIIKMN 14J IMINE +25 385
#note still inferencing EO?, no chance he doesn't have another E. IMINE is crappy. the best thing to do is 1G MAIN, killing the biggest lane and keeping tiles to score after his bingo. -2.5
>robin: ?EELNOR N10 LO. +6 330
#note weird, another not-checking-bag mistake. i haven't had one of these come up for a while, let alone 2 on the same night. he actually had ALEuRONE but i would have still won with SKIRT or something of the sort.
