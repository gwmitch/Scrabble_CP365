#note missed a lot here and I knew it.  P(O)sTURAL is the obvious best.  non-bingo playes of PU(PA)L and AP(PA)L are laso probably better.
>David_G: ELMORSS 6B MORSELS +74 208
#note ULPANS*  Had no clue.  Apparently the plural for ULPAN is ULPANIM.  A Hebrew School in Israel, so I guess that makes sense.
>Brett_H: ?DORRTY 2B TORRiD.Y +72 190
#note best.  Only other bingo is (H)YDRaTOR for 68.

>Brett_H: ABEIRTY E4 BE.TIARY +102 292
#note Anagrams to SYBARITE, but was set to play Y(T)TERBIA if he blocked this lane.

#note saw the tiles, andjust played off the junk.  Didn't think very hard on this one.  Using the same tiles, I could make KAU(R)I for 20, but the star play is AZUK(I) for 69, which I saw pretty much as soon as I hit the clock.  Very bone-headed mistake here.  Other fun words include KRUBI and UAKARI.

>Brett_H: AINRTTZ K10 TINT +24 329
#note He thought for a very long time on his last play, so I knew he was close to something.  Wanted to push the bingo lane down a line to make for easier comebacks in case he did hit the S-hook bingo.  Should have just taken the points and turnover with Z(E)ATIN.
>David_G: ?EGNTUV C6 .UTGiVEN +78 362
#note This is a classic Gibson move here.  He could have played OUTGIVEN on the two other triple lanes for 83 points each but I'm assuming picked this one cause it didn't give up big comebacks.  It does give up the D12 square for possible big plays, but he would likely have a big comeback to obviate that kind of play.  Most everyone else would just jump on the triple lane.  I didn't talk to him about it after the game cause he just had throat surgery.  Any thoughts.
>Brett_H: AEMNRSZ O3 Z.NERS +45 374
#note Quackles says to play off the Z.  Stupid Quackle.  10 of the 22 unseen tiles don't hit the bingo.  Then it says MAZE which is setting myself up for disaster.  Not saying mine is best, but those plays seem particularly bad.

#note MIF(FED)@K1 is a great play here.  Mine is not too far behind.
