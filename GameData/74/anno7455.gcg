>Paul: ALRSUW H3 WALRUS +20 20
#note I took messy notes and for a while I couldn't figure out who went first, but then I remembered that WALRUS was Paul.
>John: EFFHIIW -EFFHIIW +0 0
#note This looked unplayable at the time, but I feel like I might've whiffed on something here.
>Paul: EEY I1 EYE +13 33

>Paul: EGINNPU C9 PENGUIN +92 178
#note Great fit. Hardly elementary.
>John: AERZ 13A AZ.RE +14 63
#note Oops, we already have enough of those. RAZE at G2 or F4 looks clearly better.
>Paul: DFO 11A FO.D +8 186
#note This play seems out of place. Must be a set-up.
>John: GOOOO 12C .OOGOO +28 91
>John: GOOOO --  -28 63
#note This is where the game really unravels for me. I got a sense that he was sitting on something here, so B13 ZOO, blocking the big hotspots, would be the prudent play. And, of course, this turns out to be phony.
>Paul: CEKLNOR A7 CORN.L.KE +229 415
#note Okay, not even joking here, CORNFLAKE is phony, CORNFLAKES is acceptable. I couldn't make up something that silly.
>John: GOOOO -OOOO +0 63
#note After failing to challenge CORNFLAKE, I was too flustered to realize that ZOO is now an even better play.
>Paul: CGINY 6G C.YING +14 429
>John: AEGMN L4 EG.MAN +22 85
>John: AEGMN --  -22 63
#note Whatever, eff Scrabble. Next you'll tell me ERASERHEAD is no good.
>Paul: OTT 14E TOT +7 436
>John: ?AEGMN L4 yE.GMAN +26 89
#note Of course this is a big-time frustration play, but I just wanted to point out the absurdity of it all. We've all heard of eggmen, who's ever heard of a yeggman?
>Paul: IT G12 TI. +4 440
#note I can't put my finger on it, but Paul's next three plays seem to remind me of part of an old song.
>John: BJU 9I JUB. +21 110
#note JUBA JUBBAH JUBHAH
>Paul: IT 12G .IT +4 444

#note Aargh, now I'm messing up threes?!? I must be tripping.

>Paul: ?EILNOS 4A SEmOLIN.. +68 543
#note You know, it's pretty classless to intentionally block FABLIAUX while up by three hundred. I let Paul know that I considered that a cheeky move.
>John: AABFILX A1 FAB. +27 188
#note FLAX at M2 or K11. Not my best performance. Ob-la-di, ob-la-da.
