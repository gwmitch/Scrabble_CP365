#note for some reason i didn't like F1 SKI that much. i wanted to kill the X spot already. the problem is the bad leave of course. -7.5

#note i know i'm creating another X spot but now i have the blank! also LAZING at K7 is better, i didn't see it. -6

>Me: ?IILNOS M1 LIONISe. +66 363
#note i have to be freaking out (i was low on time and foresaw a close endgame) to not see that LIONISeR scores more! also, lionised gives a lot more back (was i worried about an -able 3x3, i don't know?) -5.5
>stern: ELVX 2J VEX.L +46 340
#note whew (to alan's credit, as a director who's constantly updating the current scores/etc for the next round matchups, he didn't notice he was emptying the bag. if he just dumps the X at 11E i can still play MAFIA anyway though.
>Me: AAFMOOS J10 FA.OS +32 395
#note TECHNICALLY this is the right endgame, but only because it blocks arrogant/tarragon as a disconnected word. i really shouldn't have chickened out on MOLAS.
