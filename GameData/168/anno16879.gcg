#note Man oh man oh man. When I turned over my first four tiles I saw FOCC. I thought, "there is no way I'm going to draw into FOCCACIA again, is there?". I was dumbfounded to draw my other 3 tiles and wanted my dream to come true again. Playing a 30 000 prob 8 twice in my short lifetime... Too bad it didn't. I really considered phonying here too. Maybe I should play FOCALIC*...  "http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150467647373004&set=a.80128318003.83593.610368003&type=3&theater"

#note So I missed three bingos here. The highest-scoring one I considered but chickened out on, the second I didn't know, and the third I really really should have seen. Can you find all three?

#note 13I POL(Y)PI is really cool. Not the right play though I think. I don't think I should be worried about him capitalizing on this opening as N1 is already threatening, and so is N10. 
>Sean_Baizana: ?DEILSS 15D SLIDErS +81 189
#note Sean was wondering if he had a -LESS word at N1. He had aIDLESS, but he didn't think it was a word, and he also had LIDlESS, which neither of us knew. N2 IDLeSSE is also a new word for me. This is good cause it gets me worried about the X bomb

#note oh yes, 5C B(I)ZONE. I didn't care to solve this endgame, which was silly. All the candidate plays block Sean's out of (O)UTEARN, which he didn't see. I don't know if Sean would have blocked my XU out at C7 either, in which case I lost 20 points in this endgame.
