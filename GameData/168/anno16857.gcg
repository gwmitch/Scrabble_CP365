#note Sim says keeping AR is a bit better. I don't like doubled As so I threw in the A.
>Quackle: ?AILLNP 9D PLAINLy +74 96
#note Scored as 72. Just like that, I'm almost 100 points down.
>New_Player_1: EEGILNR 7H LEERING +63 63
#note Good thing I didn't try RE(P)ELING# which I considered.
>Quackle: AAFOOOY 6I AHEM +38 134
>New_Player_1: DINNRVY N2 DRYIN. +26 89
#note I was surprised PRIVY keeping double Ns is better than this. VINERY is the best play but I didn't know it. This is 4th. 
>Quackle: AH 10E AH +28 162
>New_Player_1: CEIMOSV 11C MOVIE +38 127
#note This and VIM are the two best plays. Considered both but thought the 4 extra points were worth it here.
>Quackle: AEOR 8A AERO +20 182
>New_Player_1: ABCEJST D11 .BJET +30 157
#note Wasn't sure of ABJECT. This is the next best play. 
>Quackle: ADO E13 ODA +18 200
>New_Player_1: ACCOSTV 4K CAV. +24 181
#note VO(MI)CA. Didn't know it. This is 3rd at about 34% to win.
>Quackle: EILU I9 .IEU +4 204
>New_Player_1: CDIOOST 13B DO.. +24 205
#note Best. Too bad I didn't have an R as DIC(TA)TOR for 99 would have been awesome. 
>Quackle: AFIN H12 NAIF +27 231
>New_Player_1: CINOPST 14A COP.. +30 235
#note Best. 
>Quackle: EFNUWWY O1 ZEE +41 272
>New_Player_1: IKLNSST 13G K.S +19 254
#note This is the play that loses me the game. I saw plays using ICKER like LICKER, TICKER and NICKER, but was too afraid to play them because they both take an S and with two unseen, I thought he was very likely goign to use the TWS on H1. This sims around #6.
>Quackle: FTTUY A14 .G +15 287
#note He played something for 15 points but I didn't record what it was. This play keeps the score the same, though it's certainly not the play he made. 
>New_Player_1: ILNSSTW B3 TWINL.SS +65 319
#note Phony. But I felt I would lose the game unless this stays on the board. It was held but released. The best legit play S(TA)W wins 30%. This wins 60% if it stays. 
>Quackle: FTUY 3B .UFTY +22 309
>New_Player_1: EGINOOT 8K EGO +19 338
#note A tough choice, as it'll most likely come down to whether or not he bingos again. This is best according to Quackle, but due to the CG play, I don't know exactly what was in the bag. 
>Quackle: ?ABEERU 2F AUBERgE +69 378
#note :(
>New_Player_1: INOSTTX 1A TOXINS +48 386
#note Everything loses now. He held ADRW, meaning the 15 point play used the tiles ROUT. Not sure what it was. 
>Quackle: AORRTUW 1H AW +32 410
>New_Player_1: T I1 ..T +7 393
#note Final score recorded as 399-408. A tough start to a tournament.
