#note commentary by both eric and me
>JD: ADFIILT F6 FL.ID +21 21
#note LITAI is pretty cool, very defensive play.
>Eric_Cahanin: AGNOUVV 7H GUV +11 37
#note eric: Should've probably just exchanged.
>JD: AAIITTT J7 .ITTA +10 31
#note close with AIT and TAFIA, guv probably means a leave with an S in it so maybe AIT to be more defensive.
>Eric_Cahanin: AEKNORV E2 KNAVE +29 66
#note invoke is the play
>JD: ADIMNPT K10 AMP +24 55
>Eric_Cahanin: EFLOORS K1 FOOLERS +78 144
>Eric_Cahanin: EFLOORS --  -78 66
#note eric: there's no foolering Jesse Day. SE(A)FLOOR is the play, though I won't see it next turn either.
>JD: ?DEEINT 12G INcE.TED +81 136
#note JD: I did not get this play right, he has seafloor but he might not see it. I should block SEAFLOOR, but given his last play he may well miss it - at the very least, DETINUE would've been better to prevent giving him new 8s.
>Eric_Cahanin: EFLOORS N8 FLOO.ERS +78 144
#note Eric: I thought this would surely win best NOLA theme word. Too soon?
>JD: AEINOUX O4 XENIA +75 211
>Eric_Cahanin: ACGIPRS 15L GA.P +27 171
>JD: AENOQUW N1 QUEAN +39 250
#note QUAKE might be a little better because of the cheap points for QI.
>Eric_Cahanin: BCDIRST 4D C.TBIRDS +78 249
>JD: EEIOORW M4 WOO +22 272
#note the board is not that open, I should be flipping over more tiles to try to score more points - EEIR won't do much. REWOKE or ROOKIE look good.
>Eric_Cahanin: AEJLNWY M11 J.W +45 294
>JD: EEEILRY 2B REE.Y +40 312
>Eric_Cahanin: ?AEHLNY 13B HYALiNE +81 375
#note Eric: I got distracted looking at 1F AsHENLY*. I worked out that it wasn't good, but it still looked so good. HYALiNE is the only one here.
>JD: EIIILOT O1 IT +41 353
>Eric_Cahanin: EEIMNOT 1F ONETIME +85 460
#note eric: whew.
>JD: EGIILOU 14A GIE +23 376
#note game's over, might as well take the points.
