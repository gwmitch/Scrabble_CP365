#note I didn't like OI at E11 because it partially blocked the A and there weren't many consonants
to bingo through. after a play on row 7 by him next turn it seemed quite hard to bingo. on the other
hand, OI may keep the board open by encouraging him to play at D12. Q says playing OI is 4 points
better, but I think exchanging again is fine.

#note close between jeez, gizmo, maize and jive. I thought his last play suggested he was quite
likely to have an A, so I decided against gizmo. his fish last turn suggests he is more likely
to bingo, so it seemed more possible that he wouldn't hit the J immediately. the most important
thing with this kind of rack is to plan a way out of it, but in this case I didn't have much in mind
besides taking the points and figuring the Z would be easier to play than the J.

>Jesse: FGMNUWZ 12A FUZ. +20 238
#note unmew is a few better, I thought GMNW had a better chance of working out than FGZ, because I
will likely need to bingo asap, but the Z can pick up cheap points with fuzed/fuzee or feaze or
something.

#note things seemed really bad when he blocked swagman, but at least I can score
>Joey: DEEHORY L12 HEY +30 396
#note Shutting down the last easy bingo lane with a play that's probably right anyway.
>Jesse: ?ADGMOS 13B MAD +51 334
#note I saw megadose here but passing up the bingo must be better
>Joey: DELNORR J5 ROL. +19 415
>Jesse: ?AGIOPS 14A OP +22 356
#note I again have a bingo (SAPOGENIN, which I didn't know) but this is definitely the best play,
setting up a difficult lane to block unless he plays at 15A
>Joey: DEGIINR 3G REDI..ING +76 491
#note Jesse - "damnit joey"
Joey - "Maybe this wasn't such a bright idea.  I almost missed it and briefly considered not opening
up the 3x3 lane, but a G in that spot seemed pretty hard to use."
>Jesse: ?AGIIRS 9M .I +9 365
#note all of a sudden, I realized that he had no vowels, and that I could fish for the 3x3. setting
up XI here is not relevant, he can always play a blocking play at 8M, just distraction.
>Joey: BCDLPTW H1 BL.W +39 530
#note Jesse - "unbelievably, joey saw that I had a 3x3 but had the score wrong (me with 10 points
less) and therefore DIDN'T BLOCK because he was going to win anyway."
Joey - "A pretty self defining final play by me.  I thought Jesse had 228 after FUZE instead of 238,
which is when my math started going wrong.  I didn't care that I would win by less since I had a tie.
Otherwise I would have simply blocked with ELD and let him play his lower scoring bingo elsewhere."
>Jesse: ?AGINRS O1 NI.GARsS +149 514
#note Jesse - "with 15 seconds on my clock I found the only winning play, but circled THE WRONG
LETTER (an S) on the designation sheet...and only realized it a minute after the end of the game!"
Joey - "And so I fall to 341-2 when scoring at least 500 points.  If one must lose, it might as well
be memorable and be worth twenty bucks."
