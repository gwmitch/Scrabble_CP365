#note I liked making a short play to keep the most bingo-prone leave here, but Quackle points out a superior way: NECK F7. Forks open S hooks on both sides (NECKS and SNECK).
>Geoff_Thevenot: IIIIII -IIIIII +0 28
>Evans_Clinchy: ACIMNST D4 MITC. +24 37
#note Sim likes MANIC 10F best, and it's not hard to see why - 29 points, ST is a strong leave, and I'm forking open two S-hooking lanes since MANIC and KINA both take the mouse.

#note I wasn't sure of KINDY#. There's DINKIES/KINDIES# but I thought the singular might only be KINDIE#. EYE in that spot appears best. This sims a ways back - ditching the R here is actually a fairly significant blunder, as it's a valuable bingo tile and there aren't any left.
>Geoff_Thevenot: AITV 12A VITA +34 358
>Evans_Clinchy: ?BENQST N12 BET +14 366
#note I thought this was pretty cool at the time, but it's actually fairly weak. My thinking was that with NQS? and two U's in the pool, I was fairly likely to hit a bingo, and BET worked either as a setup or a diversion while I hit line 12 instead. The problem with this? The pool sucks. Way too many 2-tile draws can mess me up here. I'm only 6.9 percent to bingo after BET, with an average score next turn of 46.9. Not good enough to justify fishing. The better choices here are taking the points with ILLUSIONS/ST# for 35 and taking the more likely bingo by exchanging BQ.

>Evans_Clinchy: ?ENQSUY --  -111 366
#note Quite possibly the dumbest play of my life. Not only is it a raunchy phony, but I have a million ways to win the game without it. QUEY/BETE# scores 84 and keeps the blank!
>Geoff_Thevenot: HOW 15M WHO +36 394
>Evans_Clinchy: ?ENQSUY 1C NYE +26 392
#note Suddenly things look very bleak. It's probably better here to play just NY# - with the funky pool, it's preferable to keep the E and not dig so deep into the bag. But I'm probably sunk either way.

#note Blocking JOUR#, which is unnecessary. Best is just to take the 38 points with PLAQUE.
