#note Best.
>Ruchi: ELZ J6 ZE.L +33 33
>Brett: BIINSTU 6H BI. +14 30
#note Best.
>Ruchi: DEEHX K3 HEXED +50 83
#note overscored by 8.  
>Brett: INNSTUY 4J Y.N +12 42
#note wasn't ready to burn my s yet... Q wants me to play nus at K4.
>Ruchi: AARU 5E AURA +12 95
>Brett: AIKNSTU 3K .UNK +24 66
#note OK, I didn't know tanukis (a racoon dog).  My move is a bit down the list.  
>Ruchi: OT J6 ....OT +17 112
>Brett: AAEIRST 12G ARISTAE +82 148
#note Not good.  I know ASTERIA/ARISTAE/ATRESIA!  ASTERIA at O2.  Maybe I was anxious to get my bingo down.  
>Ruchi: ASW O1 WAS +30 142
>Brett: EF 4G EF +23 171
#note I didn't write down my rack....
>Ruchi: ?GIILOT D2 TOILInG +73 215
>Brett: ACEMRSS M8 CREM.S +22 193
#note I really missed SCREAMS and MASS(A)CRE.  
>Ruchi: AAENOP C8 APNOEA +25 240
>Brett: AGQSTUY 12A QU.Y +52 245
#note Crucial play here--and turning point.  8A is less risky but I realized that there weren't too many ways for her to hit the triple word since I has the case A, no esses and only 1 u out.  AGTS is a decent leave if she does hit it though.    
>Ruchi: I A12 .I +11 251
>Brett: ADGHRST E9 TRASH +33 278
#note (WAS)HRAGS would have been a heck of a play!  Didn't see GR(I)TH.  My play is not on the list, even though it scores.  Tried to think of a play like T(O)RAH to hit the double letter but couldn't at the time.  
>Ruchi: OVW B6 VOW +24 275
>Brett: DEEGLOV H11 G.OVE +27 305
#note Best.  It scores but opens the board...  Just needed to hope her rack wasn't together.  
>Ruchi: BDEILRT 15D BRID. +11 286
#note She first puts down BRI(T)TLED....which is good!  I was ready to challenge.  She takes it back, then blocks my bingo!  I guess she then thought I had the blank.   Good knowing she doesn't have the blank though.  
>Brett: DEFILMR C1 FILM +28 333
#note Best.  REFILM(E)D blocked!  
>Ruchi: EEGILNT 14H .ET +8 294

>Ruchi: LNOT 2B N..OL +18 357
#note Crafty phony.  
>Brett: EIN K10 NI.E +14 388
#note I went over time but found the best play here.  Some bad placement and missed one bingo.  Fortunate to pull this one out.
