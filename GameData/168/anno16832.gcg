#note Wheeee!!!!  I was about to put down the stylish non-bingo 2x2 WORDAGE on row 5...then I noticed the T on row 14.  This is my only bingo.  99-1/2% to win...but this game isn't over yet.

>Jim_Burlant: CDGOPTU L4 COU.D +20 349
#note The only decent scoring option I have here is 13B COPS, but that leaves too much garbage.  Outsdie of that play, everything else I have scores 18 - 20 points.  Scorewise this is as good as anything else, but the better play would have been a word I didn't know:  PUTLOG L4.  Regardless, I'm still over 99% to win.

>Jim_Burlant: GLOPRTU N6 P.ULT +30 379
#note You'll notice I'm averaging over 60 per turn, yet my lead is barely a baby bingo.  Yikes!  As for this -  I was paranoid about the duck hitting somehting like OXO N5. This is a strong choice, but it's not best - the better play would have been 2J PLOUGH both for the score (it scores 36 to this play's 30) and leave (it unloads the G).  Still in good shape, and this comes out in the wash.

>Jim_Burlant: ADEGNOR 10G DRAGONE. +64 443
#note When you're hot, you're hot.  Quackle gives slight preference to ANDROGEN 10D, since it scores 66 to this play's 64.  I prefer the defensive position of this play given the stage of the game. 
>q: INNNOTT A12 .ONT +21 350
>Jim_Burlant: AABEEEJ 13J AJEE +25 468
#note While there are a couple of plays that score more than this (C9 JEEZ, N1 JAB), I was more concerned about preventing something like VITRaINS on row 12.  This does the best job balancing the rack while defending against VITRaINS.   Quackle agrees - this is best.
>q: ILNNPTX 5E P.NTIL +16 366
>Jim_Burlant: ?ABEQUY 12L BY +27 495
#note I figured that by keeping as much of this together as possible, I'd maximize my chances of having one more monster play.  Quackle agrees - this is best.
>q: IIKMNRX A1 .INK +13 379
>Jim_Burlant: ?AEIQSU 15J SEQUIn +76 571
#note Ah well.  If a 76-point end game play can be a mistake, this is it.  It pays to look at the whole board  2J QUAIGH/QUAICH score 74 and don't give back what this does.  Those plays win by 12 more points.

#note Games like this don't happen often against Quackle - I'll take it. :-)
