#note He laid down BRAIN first then took it back, which sucks because an A would've been really helpful.

#note No place for ORCINOL. This was an interesting endgame. We went through all of the different scenarios and figured out that I could've tied this game, but we found no winning play. Quackle, however, says I can win if I play COON at D1 and he plays anything at 15A (if he plays N10 F(E)WER he wins the game because it blocks (D)ILLY next turn)

>Kolton: LNNOOY D3 OY +33 434
#note I could only find a 16-point-loss at this point because I whiffed on (D)OOLY which would've only been a 5 point loss.
