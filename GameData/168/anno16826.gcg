#note Darrell is as defensive as they come, so it's about 100% that he's got an S (or at least an A and really good stuff) here. I think I have to address this spot...

#note Wasn't quite certain enough that SWON* was invalid so I didn't play WON J2.

#note Darrell's complete rack. This play is textbook Darrell. I suspect he overlooked FANE(G)A though.

#note Not interested in making plays along the 2 row and giving back O1. Darrell smartly pointed out after the game that ZEBRA is very much a possibility that will blow open this game though. Should I block it?

#note As it was, I was in excellent position to win this game. But picking up the blank like this is just cheap. 

I gave some thought to not bingoing here to avoid a C-stick, but decided against it because I could outrun him pretty much all the time in a C-stick situation unless I pulled both Cs.
