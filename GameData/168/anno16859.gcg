>New_Player_1: AFIILUV K3 FLAVI. +24 24
#note I think this was my rack (pretty ugly). If so, this is best. But I'm already down to 18% to win.

#note :((
>New_Player_1: AEEIKUZ F8 .AZEE +34 58
#note Didn't like FUZE and it's too easy to hook. I was a bit frustrated with his first two plays and this probably stopped me from finding AZURE, 34 ZERK 48, GAUZE 30 which are better than this. This comes in around #10. 
>Quackle: ABO G8 .BA +26 140
>New_Player_1: CIKLRUY 3K .URY +22 80
#note Again my frustration shows. I should have played F(UCK) to show how I feel. But the way my luck was going so far, I was about certain he had the S. YUCKIER is a bad miss though. I thought CK went really well together and since this scores and doesn't  give up an S hook, I thought it was pretty good.

#note KILLIE. DIdn't know it. This is next best.

#note Q says GL(E)N but everything pretty much sucks here. This opens the board and gives me a good bingo line so I thought it was a good play. 
>Quackle: ?EEINNS 15H .EINSmEN +74 259
#note I pretty much gave up at this point. ENGINEERS would have been a nice find. He's >98% to win.
>New_Player_1: BDEIINR 13F DI. +25 142
#note I feel I need to hope for an X bomb on J14.
>Quackle: ADVY 11J DAVY +25 284
>New_Player_1: BEEINTU 2L NEB +29 171
#note I decided to go for points at this stage of the game. I wanted to keep 14J open for the X bomb again.

>New_Player_1: EIITTTU 13K TUTTI +13 184
