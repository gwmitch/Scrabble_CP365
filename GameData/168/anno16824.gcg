#note bonk wins a sim, sets up nice S hook, more difficult to overlap, enps leave not really an upgrade over eps

#note no particular point in fishing, much more important to try to draw the S or blank and turn over tiles. loan at m2 looks good. the beginning of the end
>Carolyn_Boyd: ADRST M2 DRATS +31 236
>Carolyn_Boyd: ADRST --  -31 205
>JD: AEILNOR M2 LOAN +24 264
#note quackle suggests roan instead of loan to avoid setting up a counterplay for her, but I wanted to bait her into burning the S on this turn so she wouldn't have the easy SHOES hook.

#note dreadful play already under heavy time pressure, exchanging and increasing my chances of drawing the blank is paramount.
>Carolyn_Boyd: ADELRU 15J LAUDER +28 306
>JD: EIIMOTT -  +0 298
#note definitely was not in the right state of mind making this challenge, this was my first game of scrabble since worlds and it felt like I was just looking it up at a 5 point penalty! if I don't challenge I get to chase the blank by playing OMITTER. awful decision.
>Carolyn_Boyd: ACORTU O9 CURATO. +10 316
#note instead she has now turned over the last 12 tiles, giving herself a much better chance at the blank
>JD: EIIMOTT 12B ...T +15 313
#note I'm screwed at this point, might as well play TIEPIN as suggested in the hopes of drawing a lucky bingo. instead I am signing my own death warrant.
>Carolyn_Boyd: ?AEFIIPRTWY 14N W. +20 336
>JD: EIIMOTY 14E OI +8 321
#note I believe I drew the Y on my previous turn. I couldn't even figure out a bingo to fish for.
>Carolyn_Boyd: ?AFIPRT 15F PI. +10 346
#note she can do whatever she wants at this point
>JD: EEIIMTY F9 I.. +3 324
#note ran out of time
>Carolyn_Boyd: ?AFRT 6D FARTs +16 362
#note a disastrous game for me, but really it all came about because I was playing too damn slow - something that happens when I'm a bit rusty. Also, forgetting that it was lose-your-turn challenge. Credit to Carolyn for playing well at the end.
