#note Took me too long to be sure of this play, but it turns out it's the only bingo.

#note Quackle prefers lots of other plays, all keeping the blank. That was really tempting, but he's got to have something that goes here. I only get about 35 out of the blank, but the defense is worth a lot to me.

#note Or maybe he just wanted the volatility.

#note This was a good play, opening two lanes, and it indicates that he has the last S. I'm in trouble if I can't close this off.

#note The only thing I'm worried about with this is an X play off the O. Otherwise, I love it. Cut off his hook to the triple and give me the last one.

#note He's hoping to draw an A, but I've got the last two.

#note Definitely one of my better games this tourney. OUD and CEDI are the only plays that were really mediocre.
