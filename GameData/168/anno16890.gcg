#note My move throws out some floaters when the board isn't amenable to S-hooks, but UREMIC H1 for 39 is probably superior

#note Really don't like blocking row 2, but the next best option is the humble VAV 10K with its own drawbacks
>Alastair_Richards: ABEEL M10 ALBEE +16 345
>Andrew_Fisher: AFFHLSV L12 AFF +36 328
#note Here's a chance to take a leap of faith (that you will draw the right letter to capitalise). There's one Y left to make AFFY, and drawing it now becomes pivotal - a useful tactic when you are in arrears, and AFF also scores handily
>Alastair_Richards: EGOU D2 .OUGE +18 363
>Andrew_Fisher: ADEHLSV 6A HAV. +12 340
#note A pretty move in a similar vein is EVO 3B, allowing LEVO. Turns out that this would give HALOIDS, HOLARDS, LADDISH or LADYISH in column A if drawing the right tiles, or the massive SHADILY in row 15, and it leaves one in the bag to boot. My choice aimed to open up another flank, but it's less effective albeit delivering a few wins here and there.
