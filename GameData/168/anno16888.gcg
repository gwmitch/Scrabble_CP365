>Paul_Sidorsky: AOR 8F ORA +6 6
#note The last game in the tournament, I had to win or lose by less than 27. I wrote this in bold letters at the top of my scoresheet. Then I cried a little when the first three tiles I drew were U's.
>Curran_Eggertson: ADGOUUU -UUUOG +0 0
#note Q says toss the A as well.
>Paul_Sidorsky: HPQ F7 Q.PH +26 32
>Curran_Eggertson: ADEHILS I6 HALIDES +67 67
#note While I liked HEADSAIL at H6 best for defense, I thought QPH didn't guarantee a very good rack for PAUL and I took the minorly less defense for 4 points.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ?AEINRY 12B INlAYER. +72 104
#note HEADSAIL would have given him the bingo as well.
>Curran_Eggertson: DIORRVW J4 VROW +24 91
#note Best by 7.
>Paul_Sidorsky: EGMNPR B8 PERM.NG +28 132
#note Maybe PRIME would have been the better play unless he was trying to open something up for himself?
>Curran_Eggertson: DEGIIRY C7 YID +22 113
#note YAGI (E11) won static sim, but 4-ply YID comes out a whopping 5% and 6 points up on anything else. Maybe its the ton of S's left on the board? He's bound to have one... That 8a spot is also worth blocking. This makes it hard to score.
>Paul_Sidorsky: SV 8A S..V +39 171
#note But apparently not hard enough... Maybe I can use that column A lane.
>Curran_Eggertson: EEGGIRX G6 GI.E +24 137
#note I was wary when I played it, but it went over without too much of a second look. It sims rather nicely, but Q still prefers dumping the X. I leave myself two spots for it, but don't give myself the option of playing it for more. At least I am not sitting on dupicate G's. I almost layed EX (13F) down, but took it back.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ANN K6 NAN +15 186
#note Starting to slowly close down the board.
>Curran_Eggertson: DEGIRSX 13E DEX +44 181
#note Almost played (N)IXED 8K to open the board, then realised that I didn't need to open anymore. and settled with DEX. Q agrees. Playing a pretty good game so far besides getting lucky on the phoney 4.
>Paul_Sidorsky: EEEEEE -EEEEEE +0 186
#note With this, I start to get my confidence back.
>Curran_Eggertson: AFGIKRS 4H KI.AS +34 215
#note Q doesn't like KIVAS, but doesn't know that spread is realistically 27 more points in my favour. With over 50 points ahead, I think this blocks the board much nicer than the other 10 alternatives that sim better. FAKIRS and KAFIRS (which I didn't like...) are terribly opening. Playing a short word to make HONG isn't even as defensive as Q makes it seem.
>Paul_Sidorsky: MOW 3K MOW +22 208
#note 14D MOW sims much higher. He is obviously not afraid of the S or he wouldn't play here to give the hook.
>Curran_Eggertson: DEFFGRU L8 URGED +19 234
#note Big mistake. Without bingo racks, I stop thinking about the lane in column A. I briefly think GRUFFS but laugh it off. Now Q says GUFFS and it makes so much sense. There are no places for Fs on this board.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AEILNST A1 ELASTIN. +77 285
#note At least he would have been able to have played at L8 which is a small consolation for the terrible oversight.
>Curran_Eggertson: CEEFFOR 4A .COFF +26 260
#note Being bingoed against always compounds mistakes. At this point, I finally looked at the H1 spot and decide against CORK or anything sensical. FECK, which I did not know, has 16% higher win percentage than SCOFF.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AZ 2J ZA +36 321
>Curran_Eggertson: EEEJOOR 3C JOE +48 308
#note I do not understand why Q likes JEE by 6 points and 5%. Someone fill me in. Is it keeping the R hook?
>Paul_Sidorsky: EILOU 1K LOUIE +24 345
>Curran_Eggertson: CEEIORU H1 ROC. +30 338
#note ROCK doesn't even get chosen by Q. By this point, I am just trying to keep the score close. ROCK may best the vowel dumps Q prefers if it accounts for the 27 spread I can give, but even soo, RUCK or REEK likely better.
>Paul_Sidorsky: AOT 11B .OAT +23 368
#note Unseen tiles are looking way too good. I can still stand a chance, but blocking is looking incredibly difficult while still scoring. I had 9:00 at the beginning of this turn, and took my time down to 2:00.
>Curran_Eggertson: BEEINTU M6 TUBE +16 354
#note Naturally another stupid play. I just want to hand him this game. Q is not predicting this right for the aforementioned reason, but for some reason, it REALLY does not like the play that I like in hindsight, (MOW)N. Cuts down the bingo possibilities and make the end game a bit harder for him but leaving two in the bag. TUBE gives up too much and gets nothing accomplished. TI at 5E was also going through my brain, as well as BE at K11. Both are better than TUBE, and I should have seen that.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ABET K10 ABET +26 394
>Curran_Eggertson: EIILNT 5C ET +18 372
#note spend my last minute maximizing equity here as a wave goodbye to second.
>Paul_Sidorsky: ?TU F1 UTs +14 408
#note K... I'll just lose 2nd by a few points of spread. No big deal.
>Paul_Sidorsky:  (IILN) +8 416
